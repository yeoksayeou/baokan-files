The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path forward for our country's peasants.

In commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the publication of the book *The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside*

Long Live the Spirit of the "Poor Stick"!

Wang Guofan, Party Secretary of Xipu Brigade and Chairman of Jianming People's Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province

Chairman Mao says: "In the cooperativization movement of Zunhua County, there is a Wang Guofan cooperative, with 23 households of poor peasants owning only three donkey legs, which was called the 'Poor Stick Cooperative.' They used their own efforts to 'bring down from the mountains' a large amount of production materials in three years, making some visitors so moved that they shed tears. I think this is the image of our entire country. Can't six hundred million poor sticks, through their own efforts, become a socialist country that is both rich and strong in a few decades?"

Our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, in the preface to the articles *Secretaries Take the Lead, the Whole Party Runs the Commune* and *Thrift in Running the Commune*, both praised our "Poor Stick Cooperative." Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions are a great driving force for us to strive for progress.

After our cooperative transformed from a primary cooperative to a higher-level cooperative, some cadres and commune members thought that now that we are prosperous, we shouldn't always have the "Poor Stick" spirit. We should get rid of the "old cow, broken donkey, and bumpy harness" and buy a few sets of new-style large agricultural tools to show off the "dignity" of a higher-level cooperative. The brigade party branch believed that whether to abandon the "Poor Stick" spirit is a struggle between two lines of thought. Abandoning the "Poor Stick" spirit is abandoning the revolutionary spirit, forgetting our roots, and this must not be allowed. To solve this problem, we organized cadres and commune members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions. Many people said with deep feelings, "We went from having three donkey legs to having a herd of mules and horses, from being short of food every year to having enough clothes and food, relying on Mao Zedong Thought and the 'Poor Stick' spirit. Now, our lives are prosperous, but there are still two-thirds of the laboring people in the world suffering. How can we forget our class brothers? Some also said, 'Chairman Mao compared the revolutionary spirit of our West Village 'Poor Stick' to the 'image of our entire country.' We must not abandon the 'Poor Stick' spirit."

Last year, we planned to build an irrigation station, which would cost more than 12,000 yuan. The relevant departments sent us electric motors, pumps, and other equipment and materials. We felt that this did not conform to the "Poor Stick" spirit, so we organized the masses to discuss it. In the end, we decided to rely on our own strength, to insist on the "Poor Stick" spirit, and to build an inverted siphon in the sand river and extend the mountain ring canal. As a result, we only spent more than 800 yuan, greatly expanding the irrigation area, and achieving the goal of watering the mountains with self-flowing irrigation.

Over the past ten years of hard struggle, West Village has fundamentally changed its poor and backward face. In the past two years, although we have encountered severe droughts, the average yield per mu of grain crops in the entire brigade is still several times higher than it was ten years ago. When we first established the primary cooperative, we only had three donkey legs. Now, we have large livestock, new agricultural tools, and electric equipment, with a total value of more than 100,000 yuan.

With the development of production, the living standards of the commune members are also constantly improving. Especially, the spiritual outlook of the commune members has changed greatly. The broad masses of commune members are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry forward the "Poor Stick" spirit, and strive for new and greater victories.

### “穷棒子”精神万岁

    毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了我国农民前进的道路
    纪念《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书出版十周年
    “穷棒子”精神万岁
    河北省遵化县建明公社社长兼西铺大队党支部书记  王国藩
    毛主席说：“遵化县的合作化运动中，有一个王国藩合作社，二十三户贫农只有三条驴腿，被人称为
  ‘穷棒子社’。他们用自己的努力，在三年时间内，
  ‘从山上取来’了大批的生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得下泪。我看这就是我们整个国家的形象。难道六万万穷棒子不能在几十年内，由于自己的努力，变成一个社会主义的又富又强的国家吗？”
    我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在给《书记动手，全党办社》和《勤俭办社》两篇文章写的按语中，都表扬了我们这个“穷棒子社”。毛主席的英明指示，是我们奋发图强的巨大动力。
    我们这里由初级社转为高级社以后，有些干部和社员认为，如今富裕了，不能总是“穷棒子”精神，应该把“老牛破驴疙瘩套”取消，买几套新式的大农具，显显高级社的“气派”了。大队党支部认为，丢不丢“穷棒子”精神，这是两种思想两条道路的斗争。丢掉“穷棒子”精神，就是丢掉革命精神，就是忘本，万万不能这样。为了解决这个问题，我们组织干部和社员群众反复学习了毛主席的指示。许多人颇有感慨地说，我们由过去三条驴腿发展到骡马成群，由年年缺粮变为丰衣足食，靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是“穷棒子”精神。现在，我们生活富裕了，可是全世界还有三分之二的劳动人民仍然在受苦，怎么能忘掉阶级兄弟呢？也有的说，毛主席把我们西铺“穷棒子”的革命精神，比作“我们整个国家的形象”。我们决不能丢掉“穷棒子”精神。
    去年我们打算建设一座扬水站，这座扬水站得投资一万二千多元。有关部门给我们运来了电动机、水泵等设备和物资。我们感到这样做不符合
  “穷棒子”精神，就组织群众讨论，最后确定，要依靠自己的力量，要坚持“穷棒子”精神，在沙河套搞“倒虹吸”，延长环山渠道。结果，只花了八百多元，就大大地扩大了浇地面积，实现了引水上山自流灌溉。
    我们西铺经过十年艰苦奋斗，已经从根本上改变了贫穷落后的面貌。这两年，虽然遇到了严重干旱，全大队粮食作物的平均亩产量仍比十年前成倍地增加。刚办初级社的时候，我们只有三条驴腿，现在，我们有大牲畜、新式农具和电动设备等，总值一百多万元。
    随着生产的发展，社员生活也不断改善。特别是社员们的精神面貌发生的变化更大，广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续发扬“穷棒子”精神，去争取新的更大的胜利。
