	Each red heart flies toward the place where the sun rises
		—Recording the Red Guards from Various Places Visiting Shaoshan

	Arriving at the place where the sun rises,
	Filled with joyous passion,
	We vow to follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution,
	Devoting our lives to the people and the Party!

	Shaoshan is the revolutionary holy land that all the people of China and all revolutionary people around the world long for. Our most beloved great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao was born here. Since then, an ever-rising red sun has shone, illuminating all of China and the world with its brilliant rays.

	In recent months, with the rise of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Red Guards from the capital and various parts of the country have, through revolutionary tours, crossed mountains and rivers, continuously coming to Shaoshan. They pay homage to Chairman Mao's former residence and study Mao Zedong Thought. Shaoshan has become a large classroom for Red Guards to study Mao Zedong Thought.

	The Deepest Class Sentiments

	“Day and night thinking of Shaoshan, the car flies like an arrow on a string.” These two sentences express the urgent longing of the broad Red Guards for Shaoshan. With the deepest class sentiments of boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they come from the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great capital Beijing, from the revolutionary bases of Ruijin and Yan'an, from the minority regions of Xinjiang and Yanbian, from the front lines of Fujian and Guangdong… to Shaoshan for visits and tours. The Red Guards say: Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts, our red commander. Coming to the place where the red sun rises, we feel our hearts burn even more brightly, and the sunlight is even more radiant, as if we have seen Chairman Mao's benevolent face.

	The Red Guard fighters regard their visit to Shaoshan to study as “a lifetime of unforgettable happy moments.” Every time they see each exhibit in Chairman Mao's former residence and the exhibition hall, every step they take on the land, they feel an endless surge of strength. At the cradle where Chairman Mao was born, in the room where he established the Shaoshan Party branch, on the land where he labored, in the places where he studied, and in the exhibition hall, the Red Guards listen attentively to the explanations of the guides while taking detailed notes. Ten Red Guards from Beijing Red Light Middle School (a school for the blind) were led by teachers and guides to Chairman Mao's former residence and the exhibition hall. Since they are blind, they cannot see the exhibits, so they carefully touch each item that Chairman Mao used. Many people, after listening to the explanations, were so moved that tears of happiness flowed down their cheeks. A Red Guard wrote in Braille in the guestbook: “Chairman Mao's thoughts are a beacon, shining brightly on our path forward, with horses galloping forward, forever following Mao Zedong!” One afternoon, at around six o'clock, a group of Red Guards were still visiting Chairman Mao's bedroom. By then, it was almost dark, and they could not see to write, so they read the explanations of the former residence and then ran to the window to write. The guide suggested they go outside to copy, but they replied: “The longer we stay in Chairman Mao's bedroom, the happier we feel. Writing here has greater significance!” Only after finishing did they reluctantly leave Chairman Mao's former residence.

	The Red Guard fighters, upon arriving in Shaoshan, expressed their boundless love for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao in countless words, which all converge into one voice:

		“Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!”

	Six Red Guards from the Radio Department of Peking University, all children of workers or poor and lower-middle peasants, presented a collection of Chairman Mao's photos of receiving revolutionary masses, the inaugural issue of “New Peking University” with Chairman Mao's personal inscription, and three Red Guard armbands to the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence, expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao. Thirty-seven Red Guards and revolutionary students from Guangxi Agricultural College specially donated two one-meter-tall cypress trees to the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence, expressing their boundless love, admiration, and reverence for Chairman Mao. They said: These two cypress trees represent the hearts of the thirty-seven of us: wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!

	Deep Education and Great Inspiration

	The young Red Guards, filled with revolutionary passion, visited Chairman Mao's former residence and the exhibition hall. Here, over a thousand precious photographs, documents, and artifacts are displayed, introducing the formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought and showcasing Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of leading the Chinese people in decades of revolutionary struggles. Each exhibit shines with the brilliance of Chairman Mao's great revolutionary theory and practice, giving the young Red Guards a vivid and profound education in Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao is the greatest proletarian revolutionary. From a young age, he was revolutionary, and throughout his life, he was a thorough revolutionary, educating his entire family to be revolutionary with a great communist spirit. This has set a shining example for all proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards, inspiring every beating heart. In the most critical moments of the revolution, Chairman Mao always took the lead and sent his loved ones to the most arduous places of the revolution to work and fight. When the Red Guards of Beijing Industrial University saw the portraits of the six martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution in the exhibition hall, many were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes. They said, “Chairman Mao truly gave his heart to the people, he is truly the leader of all revolutionary people in the world!” They vowed to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, reform their thoughts, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Red Guards from Zunyi No. 2 Middle School, after carefully visiting the exhibition hall, deeply felt that Chairman Mao, at every critical moment of the revolution, always stood out, overcoming “left” and right opportunist errors, leading the Chinese revolution from one victory to another. They said excitedly: Acting according to Mao Zedong Thought leads to victory, while not acting according to Mao Zedong Thought leads to failure. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must closely follow Chairman Mao, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminate the influence of this line, correctly, completely, and thoroughly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

	Some Red Guards and revolutionary students had labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants in Lankao County, Henan. After seeing the oil painting of Chairman Mao's youthful days of going to factories and villages for investigations in the exhibition hall, they felt deeply moved. They said, Chairman Mao, from his youth, combined with workers and peasants, gaining practical experience, pointing out a revolutionary path for the youth. We must better combine with workers and peasants, be thorough proletarian revolutionaries. Chairman Mao's great truth, “Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing,” is etched in their hearts. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings. In Shaoshan, they lived, ate, labored, and studied with the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Shaoxin Production Brigade, receiving praise from the community members. Old poor peasant Mao Aigui said joyfully, “Good, you have worked hard!” and told them stories of Chairman Mao's concern for the people since childhood. The students deeply felt that combining with the workers and peasants requires humility and sincerity; otherwise, it is difficult to truly achieve it.

	Forever Be the Most Loyal, Brave, and Steadfast Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao

	The Red Guard fighters received a lifetime of unforgettable education in Chairman Mao's hometown—Shaoshan. In the guestbooks and diaries, with the strongest class sentiments and the most resounding heroic words, they solemnly vow to Chairman Mao:

		“We were born to implement Mao Zedong Thought and will die to defend Mao Zedong Thought!”
		“Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be abandoned!”
		“For you, we fear not mountains of knives and seas of fire! Following you, even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our hearts will not change! Forever and ever, we will be your most loyal, bravest, and steadfast little red guards!”

	A Red Guard who went south from the capital for a revolutionary tour, after visiting Shaoshan, specially went to the home of a poor peasant in Shaoshan to get a few sunflower seeds, which he brought back to Beijing to plant. He said: I want to be like the sunflowers in Chairman Mao's hometown, always facing the red sun, always facing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, with unchanging hearts even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble!

	The Red Guards all expressed their determination to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and follow Chairman Mao in a lifetime of revolution. A Kazakh Red Guard, born into a poor herder's family, lost his father at the age of five when his father froze to death while herding for the landlord. After liberation, he stood up and went to university. He said: “Chairman Mao's brilliance shines on our homeland, giving us minorities warmth. I have seen our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao several times. Even if the sea were used as ink and the sky as paper, it would not be enough to write down Chairman Mao's kindness. I will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously reform my thoughts, carry forward the spirit of daring to venture, daring to do, and daring to revolutionize, and be a loyal soldier of Chairman Mao!” Many Red Guards, while visiting Shaoshan, made detailed records of Chairman Mao's revolutionary deeds, so they could study them at any time and spread them among their classmates.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “The world belongs to you, and it also belongs to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor, in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you.”

	The heroic Red Guard fighters truly deserve to be Chairman Mao's little red guards. They say: We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's boundless hopes for us Red Guards and revolutionary youth; Chairman Mao led the revolutionary forerunners to create a new China, and we will follow Chairman Mao closely, together with all revolutionary people in the world, to create a bright red new world!

    颗颗红心飞向太阳升起的地方
    ——记各地红卫兵参观韶山
    来到太阳升起的地方，
    满怀幸福的激情荡漾，
    誓死跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，
    把一生献给人民献给党！
    韶山是全中国人民和全世界革命人民最向往的革命圣地。我们最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席诞生在这里，从此升起了永远不落的红太阳，光芒万丈，照耀着全中国，照耀着全世界。
    近几个月来，随着无产阶级文化大革命的兴起，首都和全国各地红卫兵在进行革命大串连中，跨过千山万水，络绎不绝地来到韶山，瞻仰毛主席旧居，学习毛泽东思想。韶山成了红卫兵学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。最深厚的阶级感情
      “日思夜念到韶山，车飞心急箭上弦”。这两句话表达了广大红卫兵向往韶山的迫切心情。他们怀着对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的最深厚的阶级感情，从无产阶级文化大革命的中心、我们伟大祖国的首都北京，从革命根据地瑞金、延安，从新疆、延边等少数民族地区，从海防前线福建、广东……，来到韶山参观访问。红卫兵们说：毛主席是我们红卫兵心中最红最红的红太阳，是我们的红司令，我们来到红太阳升起的地方，感到心更热，阳光更亮，就好像见到了毛主席慈祥的面容一样。
    红卫兵战士们把到韶山参观学习作为“一生难忘的幸福时刻”。他们每看过毛主席旧居和旧居陈列馆中每一件陈列品，每走过一寸土地，都感到增添了无限的力量。在毛主席诞生的床前，在毛主席建立韶山党支部的房间里、劳动过的土地上、读过书的地方，以及在旧居陈列馆里，红卫兵们一面倾听着讲解员的介绍，一面作着详细的记录。北京红光中学（盲童学校）的十名红卫兵，由教师和讲解员牵引着，来到毛主席旧居和旧居陈列馆，他们双目失明，无法看见陈列品，就小心地抚摸着毛主席当年用过的每一件用具。许多人听了介绍，激动得流下了幸福的热泪。一位红卫兵在留言簿上用盲文写道：“主席思想是明灯，光辉灿烂照前程，万马奔腾向前进，永远跟着毛泽东！”一天下午，六点多钟了，一批红卫兵还在毛主席的卧室里参观。这时天快黑了，看不见写字，他们便看了旧居的说明，再跑到窗子旁去写。讲解员建议他们到室外去抄，他们回答说：在毛主席的卧室多停留一会，就感到多一分幸福，在里面抄，意义更大！直至抄完，才恋恋不舍地离开毛主席旧居。
    红卫兵战士们来到韶山，千言万语表达不尽对最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。千言万语汇成一个声音：
      “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    北京大学无线电系六位红卫兵，都是工人或贫农下中农的子女，他们把毛主席接见革命群众的照片剪集、毛主席亲笔题字的《新北大》创刊号以及三个红卫兵袖章送给毛主席旧居陈列馆，表达对毛主席的无限热爱。广西农学院三十七名红卫兵和革命师生，特地给毛主席旧居陈列馆送了两株一米多高的龙柏树，表达他们对毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜的心情。他们说：这两株龙柏树代表我们三十七个人的心意：祝毛主席万寿无疆！深刻的教育　巨大的鼓舞
    红卫兵小将们满怀革命激情，参观了毛主席旧居和旧居陈列馆。这里陈列着一千多件珍贵的照片、文献和实物，介绍了毛泽东思想的形成和发展，展现了毛主席领导中国人民进行几十年革命斗争的伟大实践。每一件陈列品，都闪烁着毛主席的伟大革命理论和伟大革命实践的光辉，使红卫兵小将们受到了一次生动的、深刻的毛泽东思想教育。
    毛主席是最伟大的无产阶级革命家。毛主席从小革命，一生彻底革命，教育全家革命的伟大共产主义精神，为所有无产阶级革命者，也为红卫兵小将们树立了光辉的典范，激励着每一颗剧烈跳动的红心。毛主席在革命最危急的时刻，总是自己带头，并把亲人送到革命最艰苦的地方去工作去斗争。当北京工业学院的红卫兵在陈列馆中看到毛主席一家为革命牺牲的六位烈士的遗像时，许多人感动得热泪盈眶。他们说：“毛主席真是掏尽红心为人民，真是全世界革命人民的领袖！”他们表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，改造好思想，完全彻底为人民服务。来自遵义二中的红卫兵详细参观了旧居陈列馆后，深深感到：毛主席在每个革命紧要关头，都是挺身而出，克服“左”倾或右倾机会主义的错误，使中国革命从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。他们无限激动地说：按毛泽东思想办事，革命就胜利，不按毛泽东思想办事，革命就失败。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要紧跟毛主席，努力活学活用毛主席著作，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除这条路线的影响，正确地、完全地、彻底地贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    有些红卫兵和革命师生，曾在河南兰考县和贫下中农一起劳动过。他们看到旧居陈列馆陈列的毛主席青年时代下工矿、下农村作调查的油画后，感受最深。他们说，毛主席从青年时代起就与工农结合，取得实践经验，给青年指出了一条革命化的道路。我们今后一定要更好地和工农结合，当无产阶级的彻底革命派。毛主席关于“……知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”这一伟大至理名言，铭刻在他们的心上，他们决心好好按照毛主席这一教导去做。在韶山，他们又和韶新生产队的贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，受到社员们的赞扬。老贫农毛爱桂，满心欢喜地说：“好，你们辛苦了！”并向他们讲了毛主席从小关心群众的故事。同学们深深感到，与工农民众相结合，一定要放下架子，诚诚恳恳；否则，就很难真正做到。
    永做毛主席最忠实最勇敢最坚定的红小兵
    红卫兵战士们在毛主席的家乡——韶山受到了终身难忘的教育。他们在留言簿上，在日记本里，用最强烈的阶级感情，最响亮的豪言壮语，向毛主席庄严宣誓：
    “我们生为贯彻毛泽东思想而生，死为捍卫毛泽东思想而死！”
      “头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！”
      “为了您，刀山火海无畏惧！跟着您，海枯石烂不变心！永远永远做您的最忠实、最勇敢、最坚定的红小兵！”
    从首都南下进行革命串连的一位红卫兵，参观韶山以后，特地到韶山贫农家里，要了几颗向日葵种，带回北京种植。他说：我要像毛主席家乡的向日葵一样，永远向着红太阳，向着我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，海枯石烂心不变！
    红卫兵们纷纷表示，坚决读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。一位哈萨克族红卫兵，出身在贫苦牧民家庭，五岁的时候，父亲就因给牧主放羊，冻死在外面。解放后翻了身，他上了大学。他说：“毛主席的光辉照耀着我们家乡，使我们少数民族得到了温暖。我几次见过我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，海水磨墨，蓝天当纸，也写不完毛主席的恩情。我要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，认真地改造思想，发扬敢闯、敢干、敢革命的精神，做毛主席最忠实的战士！”许多红卫兵在韶山参观时，把有关毛主席的革命事迹，详细作了记录，以便随时学习，向同学们广为宣传。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”
    英雄的红卫兵战士们，真正不愧是毛主席的红小兵。他们说：我们决不辜负毛主席对我们红卫兵和革命青少年寄予的无限希望；毛主席领导革命前辈打出了一个新中国，我们要紧跟毛主席，和全世界革命人民一道，打出一个红通通的新世界！
