In the new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the cadres and commune members of Xigou Production Brigade in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, recently held a meaningful discussion meeting. They discussed their response to Chairman Mao's call to organize and walk the collective path under the leadership of national agricultural labor model Li Shunda and others. They reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings in his brilliant work "Organize!" The entire brigade also held a grand meeting to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work.

Xigou Production Brigade is a production brigade of Xigou Jinxing People's Commune in Pingshun County. It was originally a poor mountain village deep in the Taihang Mountains. After the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Organize!" 23 years ago, the current brigade leader, then poor peasant Li Shunda, and others responded to the call under the leadership of the Party and organized several poor and lower-middle peasants to form a mutual aid team. This was one of the earliest mutual aid teams in the Taihang Mountains. Over the past 23 years, the people of Xigou have followed the path of "organizing" as indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, stepping forward one after another from mutual aid teams to cooperatives and then to people's communes. They have experienced countless struggles, transforming from poverty to prosperity, and the spiritual and production faces of the people of Xigou have undergone earth-shaking changes. At the commemorative meeting, Li Shunda detailed the struggles and changes in Xigou over the past 23 years. The commune members attending the meeting were all moved to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" They unanimously expressed their determination to forever follow Chairman Mao and bravely advance in the face of storms and waves!

In addition to Li Shunda and national agricultural labor model Shen Jilan and other cadres, the discussion meeting was attended by the poor and lower-middle peasants who were among the first to join the mutual aid team with Li Shunda. With boundless love and faith in the great leader Chairman Mao, they reviewed the brilliant work "Organize!" and enthusiastically discussed the tremendous changes in the spiritual and production faces of the people of Xigou since the publication of the work.

Li Shunda said, "The past Xigou was like this: bare mountains and hills without trees, dry stone riverbeds without water, droughts, floods, winds, and hailstorms every year, and crops failing nine out of ten years. Now, Xigou is like this: green mountains, cattle and sheep roaming the valleys, transforming from five lacks (the local area was once known for lacking trees, soil, water, people, and firewood, collectively referred to as the five lacks) to five abundances, and the poor Western Gully has become the rich Western Gully." Li Shunda counted on his fingers, "Now, the slopes of Xigou Brigade have over 5,000 mu of grassy pastureland, where more than 200 head of livestock and over 1,000 sheep are grazing. In the high mountain area covering 10,000 mu, the distant mountains are densely covered with pine and cypress trees, while the nearby low mountains and rocky riverbeds have been transformed into over 500 mu of apple orchards with 10,000 apple trees and another 100,000 walnut trees. Now, large and small gullies have been built with over 500 granaries, 15 reservoirs, and 2 water storage ponds. The village is connected by roads, and tractors have entered the area. The original rocky slopes have been transformed into flat terraced fields with thick soil layers, and the gullies have been filled with over 350 mu of good land. The fields that once yielded only 80-90 jin of grain per mu broke through the 400 jin barrier in 1956. Since 1954, Xigou has sold over 1.3 million jin of grain to the state, and the brigade now has 300,000 jin of reserve grain. With the development of production, the material and cultural lives of the commune members have greatly improved. Since organizing, the entire brigade has built 615 new houses, 38 cave dwellings, and established a clinic, a complete primary school, and an agricultural middle school. Every household has electricity, and some have radios. The brigade has grinding mills, hay cutters, threshers, and other machinery. All these are things that we could not even dare to dream of in the past.

Why has Xigou changed so much? Li Shunda said, "A ship sails with a helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. All the changes in Xigou are due to Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past 23 years, we have all closely followed Chairman Mao and walked the bright path of 'organizing' as indicated by Chairman Mao. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has armed our minds and pointed out the direction for our advance; it is Mao Zedong Thought that has taught us to have a heart for the motherland and an eye for the world, filling us with boundless strength."

Also speaking at the meeting were Deputy Brigade Leader Shen Jilan, Party Branch Secretary Zhang Junhu, and others. In their speeches, they recounted the class struggles experienced by Xigou during the three periods of mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and communes, and the various hardships encountered in transforming unfavorable natural conditions. These struggles were victorious, and Xigou achieved such success after organizing because they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In their speeches, they also mentioned Li Shunda's meeting with Chairman Mao in Beijing, where Chairman Mao often inquired about Xigou and encouraged it. They felt happy and excited whenever they talked about Chairman Mao's care and encouragement for Xigou. They said, "Our Xigou has risen through organization, and we will forever follow Chairman Mao and listen to Chairman Mao's words. Anyone who tries to restore capitalism in our country will not succeed, not even a thousand or ten thousand times. They also expressed their determination to correctly, completely, and thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's line, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end; at the same time, to firmly respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, to push the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, to learn the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' as a motto, and to truly achieve 'imprinting them in the mind, dissolving them in the blood, and implementing them in action'; and to quickly turn Xigou Brigade into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    组织起来，穷西沟变成了富西沟
    著名劳模李顺达所在的西沟大队社员重温《组织起来》这篇光辉著作
    在活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮中，山西省平顺县西沟大队的干部和社员最近举行了一次有意义的座谈会，座谈他们响应毛主席的号召，在全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达等人带头下组织起来走集体化道路的经历，重温了毛主席在《组织起来》这篇光辉著作中的教导。全大队社员还隆重地举行了一次集会，纪念毛主席的这篇光辉著作发表二十三周年。
    西沟大队是平顺县西沟金星人民公社的一个生产大队，原是太行山深山中的一个穷山村。二十三年前毛主席的光辉著作《组织起来》发表后，现在的大队长、当时的贫农李顺达等人在党的领导下首先响应，组织了几户贫下中农成立了互助组。这是太行山区最早组织起来的互助组之一。二十三年来，西沟人民一直遵循着伟大领袖毛主席指引的“组织起来”的道路，一步紧跟一步地从互助组到合作社又发展到人民公社，经历了无数的斗争，由穷变富，使西沟人的精神面貌和生产面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。在纪念集会上，李顺达详述了二十三年来的斗争和西沟的变化，参加大会的社员无不激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们一致表示，要永远跟着毛主席，在大风大浪中奋勇前进！
    参加座谈会的除李顺达和全国农业劳动模范申纪兰等干部以外，还有最早同李顺达一起参加互助组的贫下中农社员。大家怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰的心情，重温《组织起来》这篇光辉著作，并且畅谈了著作发表以来，西沟人精神面貌和生产面貌所发生的巨大变化。
    李顺达说：“过去的西沟是：光山秃岭没林坡，干石河滩没闹头，旱涝风雹年年有，庄稼十年九不收。现在的西沟是：山上绿油油，牛羊满山沟，五缺（当地过去山上无树，石多土少，干旱缺水，人也很穷，被称为金木水火土五缺）变五有，穷西沟变成了富西沟。”李顺达扳着手指头说：“现在西沟大队的山坡有五千多亩宜牧山坡地长满了牧草，在这里放牧着二百多头大牲口和一千多只羊。在面积一万亩的高山区，远山长满了密密麻麻的松柏，近山低山和乱石河滩里修起了五百多亩苹果园，有一万株苹果树，另外还有十万株核桃树。现在，大大小小的山沟里，已修建了五百多座谷坊、十五个蓄水池和两个水库。村庄通了公路，拖拉机也开进来了。原来石头很多的坡耕地都修成了土层很厚的水平梯田，山沟里还淤起了三百五十多亩好地。过去亩产粮食不过八、九十斤的耕地，一九五六年就突破了四百斤大关。从一九五四年以来，西沟卖给国家的粮食达一百三十多万斤，现在大队还存有三十万斤储备粮。随着生产的发展，社员的物质和文化生活也大大提高了。自从组织起来以后，全大队还盖了六百一十五间新房，修起了三十八孔窑洞，另外还办了卫生所、完全小学和一所农业中学。社员家家有电灯，有的有收音机，大队有钢磨、铡草机、脱粒机等机械。所有这些都是过去想都不敢想的事情。
    西沟为什么有这样大的变化呢？李顺达说：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，西沟的一切变化，全靠的是毛泽东思想。二十三年来，我们大家紧紧跟着毛主席，走了毛主席指引的‘组织起来’的光明大道。是毛泽东思想武装了我们的头脑，为我们指出了前进的大方向；是毛泽东思想教导我们胸怀祖国，放眼世界，浑身充满了无穷的力量。”
    在会上发言的还有副大队长申纪兰、党支部书记张俊虎等人。他们在发言中叙述了西沟在互助组、合作化、公社化三个时期所经历的阶级斗争，在改造不利自然条件中所经历的种种艰难困苦。这些斗争所以取得胜利，西沟组织起来以后所以取得这样的成就，就是由于他们高举了毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，由于他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他们在发言中还谈到李顺达在北京见到毛主席，毛主席常常问起西沟，勉励西沟。他们一谈起毛主席对西沟的关怀和鼓励时无不感到幸福，感到兴奋。他们说，咱们西沟是组织起来翻身的，咱们要永远跟毛主席走，永远听毛主席的话。谁想在我国搞资本主义复辟，一千个、一万个办不到。他们还表示：一定要正确地、完全地、彻底地执行毛主席的路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；同时坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作推向一个新阶段，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，真正做到“印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上”；尽快地把西沟大队办成毛泽东思想大学校。
