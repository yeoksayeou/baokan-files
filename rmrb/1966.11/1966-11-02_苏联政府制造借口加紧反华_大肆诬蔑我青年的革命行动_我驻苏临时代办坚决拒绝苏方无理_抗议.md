	The Soviet government, in order to manufacture pretexts and intensify its anti-China campaign, has recently maliciously slandered the actions of some Chinese revolutionary youth who spontaneously went to the "Anti-Revisionism Road" in front of the Soviet Embassy in China to post big-character posters. These posters protested the unjust expulsion of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and condemned their intensified anti-China activities and efforts to worsen Sino-Soviet relations. The Soviet government has viciously defamed the Chinese government and revolutionary masses and absurdly issued a so-called "protest."

	On October 27, the Deputy Director of the Far Eastern Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sudalikov, summoned the Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Zhang Deguan, and handed him a so-called "protest" note from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

	The note maliciously portrayed the revolutionary actions of Chinese youth as: "In recent days, the Soviet Embassy in Beijing has again been subjected to organized, mass provocations and insults by Chinese citizens who have been acting recklessly."

	The note insidiously stated: "Since October 23, the entrance to the Soviet Embassy has been blocked." It claimed that "things have reached the point where on October 23, some foreign diplomats driving cars with diplomatic plates could not leave the Soviet Embassy to go to their residences, and they had to return to the Soviet Embassy from the blocked street."

	The note viciously slandered Chinese revolutionary youth as "troublemakers," defaming their revolutionary actions as "hooliganism" and "riots," and absurdly claiming that "such riots are openly anti-Soviet in nature and are carried out with the connivance and support of Chinese official representatives."

	The note also attempted to shift the blame for the Soviet authorities' deliberate sabotage of Sino-Soviet relations onto the Chinese government, claiming that "organizing new provocations near the Soviet Embassy can only be another premeditated step by the Chinese side to further escalate the tensions in Sino-Soviet relations." The note accused China of "grossly violating the recognized principles of mutual relations between countries, violating the basic norms of international law, and infringing upon the immunities of diplomatic missions."

	The note finally unreasonably issued a so-called "firm protest" and "demanded that the Chinese authorities take urgent and effective measures to stop the reckless behavior near the Soviet Embassy and ensure the normal functioning of the embassy."

	Charge d'Affaires Zhang Deguan expressed great indignation at the slanders against the Chinese government and revolutionary masses in the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note and firmly rejected the Soviet side's unreasonable "protest."

    苏联政府制造借口加紧反华　大肆诬蔑我青年的革命行动
    我驻苏临时代办坚决拒绝苏方无理“抗议”
    新华社一日讯　苏联政府为了制造借口，加紧反华，最近竟然就一些中国革命青年自发地前往苏联驻华大使馆对面的“反修路”贴大字报，抗议苏联修正主义领导集团无理赶走中国留苏学生，谴责他们加紧反华和恶化中苏关系的正义的革命行动，对中国政府和中国革命群众进行恶毒的诽谤并荒谬地提出所谓“抗议”。
    十月二十七日，苏联外交部远东司司长苏达利柯夫约见中华人民共和国驻苏联大使馆临时代办张德群，交给他一份苏联外交部的所谓“抗议”照会。
    照会恶意地把中国青年的正义的革命行动说成是：“几天来，苏联驻北京大使馆又遭到有组织的成批胡作非为的中国公民的挑衅和侮辱。”
    照会别有用心地说：“自十月二十三日起，苏联大使馆入口被封锁了。”它说什么“事情竟发展到这种地步：十月二十三日一些乘坐带有外交牌照汽车的外国外交官不能从苏联大使馆前往自己的馆舍，他们不得不从被封锁了的街道返回苏联使馆内。”
    照会恶毒地诬蔑中国革命青年是“捣乱者”，诽谤他们的革命行动是“流氓行为”和“骚乱”，并且胡说“这种骚乱带有公开反苏的性质，并且是在中国官方代表的纵容和支持下进行的。”
    照会还妄图把苏联当局蓄意破坏中苏两国关系的罪责加在中国政府的头上，说什么“在苏联大使馆旁组织新的挑衅，只能是中国方面企图使苏中两国国家关系进一步尖锐化的又一个预谋的步骤。”照会诬蔑中国“最粗暴地破坏国与国之间的相互关系的公认原则、破坏国际法的起码准则和外交代表机构的豁免权”。
    照会最后无理地提出所谓“坚决的抗议”，并“要求中国当局采取紧急和有效的措施以制止苏联大使馆近旁的胡作非为并保证使馆进行活动的正当条件。”
    张德群代办对苏联外交部来照中对我国政府和革命群众进行的诬蔑表示了极大愤慨，并坚决拒绝苏联方面的无理“抗议”。
