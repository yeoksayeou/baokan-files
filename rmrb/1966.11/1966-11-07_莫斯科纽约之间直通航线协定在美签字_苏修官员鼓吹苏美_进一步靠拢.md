According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, Washington: In the context of the U.S. and the Soviet Union intensifying their collusion on issues such as Vietnam and preventing nuclear proliferation, an agreement on establishing direct flights between Moscow and New York was signed in Washington on the 4th.

Negotiations between the two sides on this issue had been suspended for five years. In September and October this year, during Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's negotiations with the Johnson administration in the U.S. on a global deal, the U.S. side proposed a series of measures to encourage the Soviet revisionist leadership to go further in their policy of surrender and betrayal. The decision to reopen negotiations on establishing direct flights between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was one of these measures. Recently, after just two weeks of negotiations, the two sides reached an agreement on this issue.

Thompson, who was recently appointed to re-assume the position of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, signed the agreement on behalf of the U.S. side. At the signing ceremony, he expressed the U.S. intention to strengthen peaceful infiltration of the Soviet Union through such "contacts" in a satisfied tone. He said: "Direct flights between the two countries... are a desirable and necessary step towards achieving a better understanding of each other."

Lokkinov, the Soviet Minister of Civil Aviation, who signed on behalf of the Soviet Union, shamelessly talked about the "convergence" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. He praised the agreement, saying: "This will be of great value in bringing our two countries closer together, promoting mutual understanding, and strengthening peaceful ties."

    莫斯科纽约之间直通航线协定在美签字
    苏修官员鼓吹苏美“进一步靠拢”
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：在美苏加紧勾结就越南问题及防止核扩散等问题大作交易的背景下，关于在莫斯科和纽约之间建立直通航线的协定四日在华盛顿签字。
    双方关于这个问题的谈判曾经中断了五年。今年九、十月间，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在美国同约翰逊政府谈判全球性大交易时，美国方面曾提出一系列措施鼓励苏联修正主义领导集团在奉行投降、叛卖政策方面走得更远，就美苏间建立直通航线重开谈判的决定就是其中的一项。最近，美苏双方经过仅仅两个星期的谈判，就在这个问题上达成了协议。
    不久前被任命重新担任美国驻苏联大使的汤普森代表美国方面在协定上签字。他在签字仪式上，以一种满意的口吻，露骨地表示了美国企图通过这种“接触”来加强对苏联的和平渗透的意图。他说：“两国之间的直通航线……是走向彼此取得更好了解的一种可取的、必要的步骤。”
    代表苏联方面签字的苏联民航部长洛基诺夫在讲话中也恬不知耻地大谈美苏“靠拢”。他吹捧这个协定说：“这对于使我们两国进一步靠拢，增进相互了解和加强和平的联系将具有很大价值。”
