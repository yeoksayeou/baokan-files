The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity has received a statement from the Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Organization. The statement strongly condemns the conspiracy by imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism to sabotage the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, which is to be held in Beijing.

The statement says that it is a well-known fact that the Fourth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, held in Accra, Ghana, in May 1965, decided to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing in 1967. This decision was warmly welcomed and applauded by the peoples of Asia and Africa. They believe that Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China and the center of the world revolution, is the most suitable and convenient place to hold the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference victoriously.

The statement points out that the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries, the Soviet modern revisionists, has opposed the correct and revolutionary line of the Asian and African peoples' struggle against imperialism and for national liberation since the beginning of our movement. They have attempted to impose their capitulationist line on our movement.

The statement says that this great conspiracy by the Soviet modern revisionists, imperialists, and their followers is unprecedented in the history of the Afro-Asian solidarity movement. They must bear all the consequences and responsibilities arising from this.

The statement further states that the Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Organization strongly condemns the activities and plots of the Soviet modern revisionists who attempt to use the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo to sabotage and split the Afro-Asian solidarity movement and undermine the decision of the Fourth Conference to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing in 1967.

The statement finally points out that the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo has a sacred duty to uphold and implement the decisions of the Fourth Conference, to make all necessary preparations for the Fifth Conference to be held in Beijing in 1967, and to thoroughly expose and condemn all the tricks and evil plots of the Soviet representatives and their followers in the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization who have betrayed the interests of the Asian and African peoples to imperialism.

    印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织谴责帝修破坏阴谋
    第五届亚非人民团结大会应在北京召开
    据新华社一日讯　中国亚非团结委员会收到了印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织发表的一项声明，这个声明强烈谴责帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义正在阴谋破坏将在北京召开的第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    声明说，一九六五年五月在加纳温尼巴举行的第四届亚非人民团结大会决定于一九六七年在北京召开第五届大会是众所周知的事实。第四届大会的这一决定受到了亚非人民由衷的和广泛的欢迎和欢呼。他们认为中华人民共和国首都、世界革命的中心北京，是胜利地召开第五届亚非人民团结大会最合适和最便利的地点。
    声明指出，美帝国主义和一切反动派的头号帮凶即苏联现代修正主义者，自从我们的运动开始以来就反对亚非人民反对帝国主义和争取民族解放斗争的正确和革命路线，并企图把他们的投降主义路线强加于我们的运动。
    声明说，苏联现代修正主义者、帝国主义者和他们的追随者这一大阴谋在亚非团结运动史上的确是空前的。他们必须承担由此而产生的一切后果和责任。
    声明还说，印尼亚非人民团结组织强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义者企图利用开罗亚非人民团结组织常设书记处破坏和分裂亚非人民团结运动和破坏第四届大会关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届大会的决定的活动和阴谋。
    声明最后指出，开罗亚非人民团结组织常设书记处负有神圣的义务维护和执行第四届大会的决定，进行一切必要的准备为在一九六七年在北京举行第五届大会，并彻底粉碎和谴责已经把亚非人民的利益出卖给帝国主义的苏联驻亚非人民团结组织书记处代表及追随者的一切诡计和罪恶阴谋。
