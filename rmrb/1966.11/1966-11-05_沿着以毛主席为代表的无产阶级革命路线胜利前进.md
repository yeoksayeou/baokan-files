Chairman Mao's sixth inspection of the Cultural Revolution army brings immense joy to the military and civilians across the nation. Marching forward victoriously along the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao. The masses enthusiastically acclaim the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 4, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao inspected revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country in the capital for the sixth time, bringing new great inspiration and fighting strength to the revolutionary masses in major cities. The broad revolutionary masses joyously shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and celebrated the victory of the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao. The broad revolutionary masses believe that Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, made an extremely important and profound exposition of the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao in his speech at the reception of revolutionary students from all over the country in Beijing on November 3. This speech has extremely profound guiding significance for promoting the Cultural Revolution. The masses expressed that they would definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and trust, seriously study Comrade Lin Biao's speech, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminate the influence of this line, correctly, completely, and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's line, further carry forward the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

The broad revolutionary masses in the capital expressed their determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line that obstructs the Cultural Revolution, and march forward victoriously along the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao. Workers from the Beijing First General Machinery Factory said, under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, our country has implemented the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a new form of the combination of Mao Zedong Thought and the masses, a new form of the masses educating themselves. We have felt from our factory's Cultural Revolution that this great democracy is very good. It can most fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of the revolutionary masses, not only can it most effectively expose ghosts and monsters but also can promote our own thought revolutionization.

The broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai expressed their most enthusiastic and excited feelings: We must, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, fully use the new forms of great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, such as great debate, great posters, great linking up, and great criticism, to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Worker Chen Fu from the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant said: "The line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao is a line that allows the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves, a line that puts 'dare' first, a line that dares to believe in the masses, dares to rely on the masses, and dares to mobilize the masses. Only by implementing this line can we defeat the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, defeat all ghosts and monsters, achieve complete victory in the Cultural Revolution, and temper the masses."

Worker Ju Yousong from the Shanghai Shipyard, after hearing the good news, was filled with happiness and strength and immediately wrote a poem: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I will forever follow you forward, I am not afraid of storms and waves, I will not retreat from mountains of fire. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao's line, I will fight to the death with him, I will defend Chairman Mao to the death, I will not be afraid of shedding blood and losing my head! I stand by the Huangpu River and sing, I will sing until the whole earth is red, wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal youth and longevity!

The broad revolutionary masses in Tianjin were extremely excited and held discussions and parades on the streets, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao. Worker Li Jirong from the Tianjin No. 4 New Cotton Mill, a model worker in Tianjin, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao's every inspection is like a lighthouse in the sea, illuminating our path forward, making the ship of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat sail correctly on the right course, bravely breaking waves and moving forward!"

The entire city of Guangzhou was in a festive mood. Many revolutionary students immediately wrote reports of joy, wrote poems, and printed leaflets to express their boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. Teams marching on the streets merged into a vast revolutionary torrent, surging and unending. The broad revolutionary masses enthusiastically celebrated the new experience of developing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line. They believed that without this great democracy, it would be impossible to carry out a genuine Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. They expressed their determination to fully use this great democracy to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism. Worker Mei Yining from the Guangzhou Steel Plant, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a model worker, said: "Even if it means climbing mountains of knives and walking on fires, shedding blood and losing our heads, we will defend Mao Zedong Thought and implement the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

The broad workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, Red Guards, and revolutionary students in Shenyang unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, further expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly eliminate the influence of this reactionary line, resolutely and thoroughly implement the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, promote the great Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to continue developing until final victory. Many young revolutionaries from Liaoning University held a discussion meeting. They promised to the most beloved leader Chairman Mao: We will definitely stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Revolutionary students and Red Guards in Chengdu immediately wrote the good news on big-character posters, printed leaflets, and spread them throughout the streets and alleys of the city. A young revolutionary, after listening to the broadcast, wrote a poem: "The mountains are cheering, the sea is singing, the people of the whole country are laughing. Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao is inspecting revolutionary young people for the sixth time! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, your care and hope are forever in our hearts. We will forever follow you, dare to climb mountains of knives, dare to brave fires, revolution, revolution, our red hearts will always be with the party!"

In Xi'an, the city was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and the revolutionary songs "The East Is Red" and "The Great Sea Sails with the Helmsman" echoed everywhere. The broad Red Guards and revolutionary students expressed their determination to continue striving, continue using the forms of great debate, great posters, great linking up, and great criticism, continue using the new experience of developing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, overcome all obstacles, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and in the struggle, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and achieve greater victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 4, the good news of Chairman Mao's sixth inspection of revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country spread to the army, navy, and air force of the People's Liberation Army. The entire army was in a festive mood. "Long live the victory of the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!" The shouts echoed through the clouds. The broad cadres and soldiers determined to raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely defend the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

On the frozen banks of the Songhua River, the soldiers of a certain artillery battalion of the Shenyang Army Corps, where Liu Yingjun was once stationed, listened to the broadcast together with revolutionary masses from various places who came to visit Liu Yingjun's deeds. The former class leader of Liu Yingjun's class, Li Hongji, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary of the proletariat. He is always with us and shares the same breath and fate with the revolutionary masses. We must, like Liu Yingjun, closely follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end." The soldiers of a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region stationed on the Pamir Plateau, after hearing the good news, immediately held a celebration meeting and, together with the revolutionary masses at Tiananmen Square, celebrated the new victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Hou Xianwen, said at the celebration meeting: "Thousands of rivers and mountains cannot separate Chairman Mao from our hearts; the biting cold wind cannot chill the red sun in our hearts; mountains of knives and seas of fire cannot stop the victorious steps of our Cultural Revolution army. We will forever follow Chairman Mao and march forward forever." The medical staff of a certain field hospital on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau held a celebration meeting after listening to the broadcast and used self-composed and self-performed programs to sing thousands of songs in unison to praise the great leader Chairman Mao. Doctor Chen Junlang recited: "A red sun rises in Beijing, illuminating the five continents. The great leader Chairman Mao steers the ship for the people of the world. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high, the revolutionary people are following closely. In a thousand words and ten thousand words, we wish the great helmsman eternal youth and longevity!"

The broad cadres and soldiers enthusiastically celebrated the new experience of developing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat created by the broad revolutionary masses in our country under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line. They unanimously said, Chairman Mao's line is the most correct line, the line of victory, the invincible and powerful revolutionary line. We must firmly and unshakably follow the revolutionary line indicated by Chairman Mao and pass it down from generation to generation. The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in the grasslands of western Sichuan, who were on duty on the former Long March route of the Red Army, heard the good news of Chairman Mao's inspection of revolutionary masses and were in high spirits everywhere in the ranks. The Tibetan soldier and active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Ren Qian, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao has always represented the party's correct line. In the past, on the Long March route, he established his leadership over the entire party, and the ship of the Chinese revolution, under the helm of the most brilliant helmsman Chairman Mao, sailed straight to the target of victory, planting the red flag all over the country. Historical experience proves that firmly implementing Chairman Mao's line is victory. Today, we must more resolutely implement the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and with the spirit of 'not a hero until we reach the Great Wall,' carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end and, on the new Long March road, closely follow Chairman Mao to victory!"

An old Red Army soldier, recalling his personal revolutionary struggle history, was very excited and said: "The ship is not afraid of big waves, the helm is steady and not afraid of many rapids; no matter how complicated the revolutionary struggle is, as long as Chairman Mao is at the helm, we can forever break waves and move forward!" The entire cadre and soldier of the "Red Seventh Company" of a certain unit of the Yunnan Army in southern Yunnan held a discussion meeting after listening to the broadcast and recalled the course of the company's victories under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The active learner of Chairman Mao's works and model soldier Kang De'an said: "We must, like the revolutionary elders, be loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, dedicate our lives to the revolution, and follow Chairman Mao closely forever." The cadre and soldiers of the company where the hero in the style of Ou Yanghai, Cai Yongxiang, once served held a discussion meeting and said: "We must, like the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Cai Yongxiang, love Chairman Mao the most, read Chairman Mao's books the most, be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought the most, and hate those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought the most. We must, like Cai Yongxiang, stand on the front line of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, defend the Cultural Revolution, and defend the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao."

The cadres and soldiers of the Navy, Air Force, Communication Corps, Engineering Corps, Railway Corps, Armored Corps, and the Beijing, Jinan, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia units, while celebrating the great victory of the line of the proletarian revolution represented by Chairman Mao, also unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the most brilliant example of the great leader Chairman Mao; resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

The great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao inspected the surging Cultural Revolution army on Tiananmen Gate.
