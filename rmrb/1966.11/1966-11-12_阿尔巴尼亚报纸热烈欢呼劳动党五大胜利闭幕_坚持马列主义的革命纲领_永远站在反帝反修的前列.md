Albanian newspapers *Voice of the People* and *Unity* published editorials on the 10th, warmly celebrating the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania.

The editorial in *Voice of the People* said that the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania will be recorded in history as a fighting congress that achieved victory for the thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, for the complete construction of socialism in Albania, and for the cause of world communism, freedom, democracy, and peace.

The editorial said: "Our Party members and the people of the whole country have found in the reports of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mehmet Shehu an inexhaustible source of inspiration for creative labor, and a powerful weapon to forever advance the cause of socialist construction and better fulfill our internationalist duties."

The editorial said that the Fifth Congress has determined to adhere to the revolutionary program of Marxism-Leninism. The directives of the Fourth Five-Year Plan approved by the Congress will further advance our country towards the complete construction of a socialist society, guiding our country from an agricultural-industrial country to an industrial-agricultural country; it has determined the path of deepening the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural spheres, the path of strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, further strengthening the unity of the Party and the people as well as national defense capabilities, and the path of continuously tempering the Party—the leading force of our socialist system.

The editorial said: The Fifth Congress has also clearly put forward our Party's and our people's Marxist-Leninist revolutionary views on international issues, determined our Party's and our people's principled stance of opposing imperialism and revisionism, and determined the task of Albanian communists and all the people to forever stand in the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle until final victory.

The editorial said: The Fifth Congress is permeated with a high degree of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary spirit, permeated with our Party's loyalty, firmness, and unyielding revolutionary spirit towards the cause of our people, towards the cause of socialist construction, and towards the cause of socialism, freedom, and peace for the whole world. This stance of our Party has received the warm support of all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in the world. The great leader of glorious China and the heroic 700 million Chinese people, our Party's and our people's respected friend Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulatory message to the Congress, has aroused boundless enthusiasm in our hearts, expressing the high respect of our brothers and closest comrades—the Chinese communists and working people—for our Party and our people, expressing the eternal friendship between our two parties and two peoples, and our determination to march forward side by side along the path of Marxism-Leninism, to wage anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles, and to overcome all storms and waves.

The editorial in *Unity* said: The Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania reaffirmed our Party's determination to advance under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, reaffirmed our Party's adherence to the mass line, emphasizing proletarian politics at all times, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, further developing class struggle, strengthening class education and revolutionary education for the working masses, and enhancing the revolutionary vigilance and combat readiness of the army and the people.

In discussing the friendship and unity between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania, the editorial emphasized: Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulations to the Congress are a high evaluation of our Party. Comrade Mao Zedong's enthusiastic words have greatly inspired our people, further arousing our revolutionary enthusiasm in the common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, for the victory of socialism and Marxism-Leninism.
