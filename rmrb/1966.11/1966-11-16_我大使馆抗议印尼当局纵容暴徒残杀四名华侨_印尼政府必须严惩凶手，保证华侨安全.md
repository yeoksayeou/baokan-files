	The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has lodged a protest with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry over the brutal killing of four overseas Chinese by Indonesian mobs. The embassy demands that the Indonesian government severely punish the culprits and guarantee the safety of overseas Chinese.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 15th, Jakarta: The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on the 12th, lodging a serious protest over the severe incident where four overseas Chinese were brutally killed by Indonesian mobs. The embassy also demanded that the Indonesian government immediately arrest and severely punish the criminals and their instigators, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

	The note stated that in September 1966, in Jakarta's Ganjung, East Java's Rebang and Malang, and South Sumatra's Palembang, four serious incidents occurred where overseas Chinese were brutally killed by Indonesian mobs.

	The note pointed out that according to information, the four overseas Chinese, Cheng Deyi, Ye Degang, Wang Jian, and Guan Jinmei, were engaged in legitimate occupations in their respective places of residence, lived peacefully, and had always maintained friendly relations with the local people. After being killed by the mobs, they left behind wives and children, whose lives were plunged into difficulty.

	The note said that the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia had previously lodged serious protests with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry over the killing of innocent overseas Chinese, but the Indonesian government has yet to provide any response or explanation. Instead, the Indonesian government continues to create a hostile atmosphere of anti-China, anti-Chinese, and hatred towards overseas Chinese, shielding and encouraging mobs to persecute overseas Chinese, resulting in old cases unresolved while new ones keep occurring.

	The note said that it should be pointed out that protecting the lives and property of foreign nationals is an internationally recognized principle of international relations. According to the relevant treaties and agreements signed by the governments of China and Indonesia on the issue of overseas Chinese, the Indonesian government has an unshirkable responsibility to protect the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese. The Indonesian government's tolerance of right-wing mobs killing Chinese nationals is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese government and people. The note finally demands that the Indonesian government compensate the families of the victims and take concrete measures to protect the legitimate rights and the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese, ensuring that similar incidents do not happen again.

    我大使馆抗议印尼当局纵容暴徒残杀四名华侨
    印尼政府必须严惩凶手，保证华侨安全
    据新华社十五日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十二日照会印尼外交部，就四名华侨惨遭印度尼西亚暴徒杀害的严重事件，向印尼政府提出严重抗议，并要求印尼政府立即逮捕和严惩凶犯及其主使人，保证不再发生类似事件。
    照会说，一九六六年九月间，在雅加达的干冬圩、东爪哇的惹班、玛琅和南苏门答腊的巨港，接连发生了四起华侨遭受印尼暴徒惨杀的严重事件。
    照会指出，据了解，在这四起事件中被印尼暴徒杀害的华侨程得意、叶德阁、王蚋和关金美四人在各自的居住地从事正当职业，为人安分守己，一向同当地人民友好相处。他们遭暴徒杀害后，都遗下了妻儿，生活陷入困境。
    照会说，中国驻印尼大使馆曾就无辜华侨被惨杀事件多次向印尼外交部提出严正的交涉，而印尼政府至今没有做出任何答复和交代。相反，印尼政府却继续不断地制造反华、排华和仇视华侨的恶劣气氛，包庇和纵容暴徒迫害华侨，以至旧案未了，新案又接连发生。
    照会说，应当指出，保护外国侨民生命财产的安全，是公认的国际关系准则。根据中国和印尼两国政府就侨民问题所签订的有关条约和协议，印尼政府对保护华侨的正当权益负有不容推卸的责任。印尼政府放纵右派暴徒惨杀中国侨民的行径，是中国政府和中国人民绝对不能容忍的。照会最后要求印尼政府抚恤死者家属，并采取切实措施，保护华侨的正当权益及其生命财产的安全，保证不再发生类似事件。
