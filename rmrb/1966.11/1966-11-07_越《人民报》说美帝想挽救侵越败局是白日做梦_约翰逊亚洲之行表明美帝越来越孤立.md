The People's Daily of Vietnam pointed out in a commentary on November 3 that Johnson's recent Asian tour shows that the U.S. aggressors are increasingly isolated politically.

The commentary said that Johnson is trying to pull the U.S. out of the blind alley of the Vietnam War and to extricate himself from the political isolation in the world. However, this is nothing but a pipe dream.

The commentary said that during his 17-day Asian tour, Johnson repeatedly talked about "peace," but just as an old fox laughing more reveals its teeth, the more Johnson talks about peace, the more he reveals his true war-mongering nature.

The commentary said: "The main purpose of Johnson's Asian tour is to force the U.S.'s puppets to participate more actively in the U.S.'s new military adventures in Vietnam."

The commentary said, "Johnson is trying to influence the puppet regimes he visited through his Asian tour. However, on the contrary, Johnson's visit and the methods used to welcome him more clearly reveal the serious nature of these countries' ruling cliques being subservient to the U.S. master, and make these cliques' positions even more precarious."

The commentary said that Johnson is trying to use his Asian tour to make a special explanation: the U.S. is not isolated. However, his visits to a bunch of lackeys like Thieu, Park Chung-hee, and Marcos more clearly show the serious isolation of the U.S.

The commentary pointed out that in the history of the U.S., no president has been condemned and opposed as much as Johnson during his overseas visits.

The commentary pointed out, "In general, Johnson's Asian tour is a political failure for Johnson and all U.S. aggressors. After Johnson's Asian tour, U.S. imperialism is even more deeply mired in the quagmire in Vietnam and is in an even more serious isolation internationally."

    越《人民报》说美帝想挽救侵越败局是白日做梦
    约翰逊亚洲之行表明美帝越来越孤立
    新华社河内电　越南《人民报》三日发表评论指出，约翰逊最近的亚洲之行表明，美国侵略者在政治上越来越孤立。
    评论说，约翰逊企图把美国从侵越战争的死胡同中挽救出来，摆脱在世界上的孤立困境。但是，这只不过是一场春梦罢了。
    评论说，约翰逊在他亚洲之行的十七天中到处重弹“和平”滥调，但是正像越笑越露出牙齿的老狐狸一样，约翰逊越谈就越露出地地道道的好战面目。
    评论说：“约翰逊这次亚洲之行的主要目的是迫使美国的仆从更积极地参与美国侵越的新的军事冒险行动。”
    评论说，“约翰逊企图通过亚洲之行，给他所访问的傀儡走狗制造影响。但是，恰恰相反，约翰逊的到来和迎接约翰逊的方法更突出地表明这些国家的统治集团附属于美国主子的严重性质，并使这些集团的地位变得更加虚弱。”
    评论说，约翰逊企图通过亚洲之行来作特别的说明：美国并不孤立。但是，他访问阮高其、朴正熙和马尔科斯等一批娄罗、人类垃圾，就突出地说明了美国的严重孤立处境。
    评论指出，在美国的历史上，从来没有一位总统出国时像约翰逊那样遭到谴责和反对。
    评论指出，“总的说来，约翰逊亚洲之行，是约翰逊和全部美国侵略者在政治上的惨重失败。在约翰逊亚洲之行后，美帝国主义在越南更深地陷于泥潭之中，在国际上陷入更严重的孤立处境。”
