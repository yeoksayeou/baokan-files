The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces have continued to inflict heavy casualties on U.S. aggressors in the province of Xining. It has been revealed that from November 3 to November 6, nine companies of U.S. aggressors and their lackeys suffered significant losses, with one company of U.S. soldiers losing all their officers, including the company commander.

According to Western news agencies, the U.S. deployed 10,000 troops from two infantry divisions in this battle. The Liberation Armed Forces fully utilized the power of people's war, using an extensive network of tunnels to cleverly and flexibly strike the enemy, causing heavy casualties. A U.S. spokesman admitted that in the intense battles on November 4 and 5, at least six companies of U.S. troops suffered severe losses. Due to the heavy casualties among U.S. officers, one company had to be temporarily commanded by a fourth-class special soldier.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on November 5, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces recently launched a fierce attack on U.S. aggressors who were conducting "sweeping" operations in the province of Xining, located northwest of Saigon. The enemy was caught off guard and found themselves in a desperate situation.

According to Western news agencies, the battle took place near the provincial capital of Xining, in a densely forested area. The Liberation Armed Forces had dug an extensive network of tunnels there, emerging and disappearing to strike the enemy, fully utilizing the power of tunnel warfare.

The battle began on the morning of November 3. That day, the Liberation Armed Forces attacked two companies of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division about 20 kilometers northeast of Xining City. After five hours of fighting, the enemy suffered heavy losses.

The next day, the Liberation Armed Forces launched two heavy artillery strikes on the base of the U.S. 196th Light Infantry Brigade, about five kilometers west of Xining City, killing and wounding a number of enemy soldiers.

At noon on November 4, just 12 hours after the artillery barrage, the Liberation Armed Forces emerged from their hidden tunnels and launched an assault on the 196th Brigade's camp, quickly penetrating the enemy's frontline positions and inflicting heavy casualties. A U.S. helicopter sent to evacuate the wounded was also shot down by the Liberation Armed Forces' artillery fire.

    六连美军遭到惨重损失，其中一连连长以下军官全被打死
    据新华社七日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量继续在西宁省痛歼美国侵略军。据透露，从三日到六日四天中，美国侵略军和帮凶军有九个连遭到重大伤亡，有一连美军连长以下军官全被打死。
    据西方通讯社报道，在这次战斗中，美国投入了属于两个步兵师的一万名军队。解放武装力量充分发挥了人民战争的威力，利用纵横交错的地道网，机智灵活地打击敌人，打得敌人死伤累累。美军发言人承认，只是在四日和五日的激烈战斗中，美军至少有六个连遭到惨重损失。由于美国军官死伤很多，以致有一个连不得不由一名四级特种兵临时担任指挥。
    据新华社五日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量最近几天在位于西贡的西北面的西宁省，痛击前去“扫荡”的美国侵略军，打得敌人难于招架，处境十分狼狈。
    据西方通讯社报道：这次战斗发生在西宁省省会西宁市附近，那里是一片丛林密布的地区。解放武装力量在那里挖掘了纵横交错的地道网，神出鬼没地打击敌人，充分发挥了地道战的巨大威力。
    据报道，战斗从三日清晨开始。当天，解放武装力量在西宁市东北约二十公里的地方，袭击了美国第二十五步兵师的两个连。经过五小时的战斗，敌军遭到大量伤亡。
    次日，解放武装力量用猛烈的炮火，两次轰击西宁市西面约五公里的美国第一九六轻步兵旅的基地，打死打伤一批敌人。
    四日中午，也就是在炮轰之后十二小时，解放武装力量走出隐蔽的地道，向一九六旅营地发起冲锋，并且迅速突入敌军前沿阵地，杀得敌军伤亡累累。一架前去装运伤兵的美国直升飞机，也被解放武装力量的炮火击落。
