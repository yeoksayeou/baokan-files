Guinean and Malian friends have enthusiastically hailed:

“Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time,” “he is the great leader of all revolutionary people in the world,” “the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire world.”

In Guinea, a worker from a printing factory, after reading Chairman Mao’s works such as “On New Democracy,” “On Contradiction,” and “On Practice,” recently told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Guinea: “Chairman Mao’s works make me love them more and more. Chairman Mao’s words truly touch the hearts of every laborer. His words are all truths, each word has great educational significance for us, giving us courage and confidence for a beautiful future.”

Another worker from a factory said: “I love Chairman Mao very much. He is the sun that never sets in our hearts. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines in every corner of the world.” A foreman from this factory, after reading several of Chairman Mao’s works, said: “Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for the people of all countries to win and defend their independence and national freedom. Once people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they fear nothing and can overcome any difficulty.”

A young worker, upon receiving a colored portrait of Chairman Mao, jumped for joy. He said: “My father is a railway worker, and he loves Chairman Mao just like I do. For a long time, we have been trying to get a portrait of Chairman Mao, and today we finally got one. I will put this portrait in a frame and hang it on the wall of my home so that we can see him every day.” This young worker also said: “Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people in Africa and the world. His books are revolutionary books, and my friends and I all love to read them.”

A cadre from the Democratic Party of Guinea said, “Mao Zedong Thought is the compass of the world revolution. To better build our country, we should study Chairman Mao’s works.”

An official from the Guinean government said: “Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time. Once the people of all countries are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can finally and thoroughly eliminate all imperialists on Earth. No matter how powerful American imperialism is, we are not afraid of it. As Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.”

Some students in Guinea are eagerly studying Chairman Mao’s works. One student said, Chairman Mao is “the greatest philosopher and revolutionary.” Another student said: “My greatest wish in life is to one day go to China to see the great Mao Zedong.”

At the Dazhai exhibition held in Bamako, the capital of Mali, Malian friends expressed their deep affection for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought with great emotion. Many spectators copied the quotations of Chairman Mao displayed at the exhibition into their notebooks. One spectator, pointing to a quotation, said, Chairman Mao is a genius in the world.

Enthusiastic Malian spectators were overjoyed when they received a Chairman Mao portrait badge or portrait. A Malian teacher, upon receiving a Chairman Mao portrait badge, said: “This is the brilliance of the lighthouse.” A young man, upon receiving a portrait of Chairman Mao, said: “I want to be a soldier of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong Thought has opened up a bright path for us revolutionary people.”

A Malian spectator named Dukur wrote in the guestbook: “We pay our respects to the respected Chairman Mao Zedong.” He said: “Mao Zedong also belongs to us because he leads our great proletarian cause, leading us in the struggle against our common enemy: imperialism, reactionaries, and opportunists. Long live our great teacher of the proletariat, Mao Zedong!”

A worker from a farm wrote in the guestbook: “Let us pay our respects to the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, wishing the great leader and helmsman, Chairman Mao Zedong, eternal life!”

  “毛主席是当代的列宁”，“是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖”，“毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着全世界。”
    在几内亚，一家印刷厂的一位工人在读了毛主席的《新民主主义论》、《矛盾论》和《实践论》等著作后，最近对新华社驻几内亚记者说：“毛主席著作使我越读越爱读。”“毛主席的话简直说到我们每个劳动者的心坎里去了。他的话句句是真理，字字都对我们有巨大的教育意义，使我们对美好的未来有了勇气和信心。”
    另一家工厂一位工人说：“我非常热爱毛主席，他是我们心中永远不落的太阳。毛泽东思想的光辉普照着世界每个角落。”这家工厂的一位车间主任在读了毛主席的几篇著作后说：“毛泽东思想是各国人民赢得和捍卫自己的独立和民族自由的强大武器。人们用毛泽东思想武装起来后，就什么也不怕，就能克服任何困难。”
    一位青年工人在得到一张毛主席的彩色画像时，高兴得跳了起来。他说：“我父亲是个铁路工人，他像我一样热爱毛主席。很久以来，我们就在设法得到一张毛主席像，今天终于得到了。我要把这张像放在镜框里，挂在我家的墙上，好让我们每天都看到他老人家。”这位青年工人还说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是非洲和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。他的书是革命的书，我和我的朋友们都爱读。”
    几内亚民主党的一位干部说，毛泽东思想“是世界革命的指南针。为了更好地建设我们的国家，我们应该学习毛主席著作。”
    一位几内亚政府的官员说：“毛泽东是当代的列宁。各国人民一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能够最后彻底地消灭地球上的一切帝国主义者。”“不管美帝国主义多么强大，我们不怕它。正如毛主席所指出的，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。”
    几内亚的一些学生如饥似渴地在学习毛主席著作。有一位学生说，毛主席是“最伟大的哲学家和革命家。”另一位学生说：“我平生最大的愿望是有朝一日能到中国去见见伟大的毛泽东。”
    在马里首都巴马科举行的大寨图片展览会上，马里朋友十分激动地表达了他们热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想的深厚感情。许多观众把陈列在展览会上的毛主席语录抄在自己的笔记本上。有一位观众指着一条语录说，毛主席是世上的天才。
    热情的马里观众在得到毛主席像纪念章或毛主席像时都满怀喜悦。一位马里教员得到一枚毛主席像纪念章时说：“这是灯塔的光辉。”一个青年得到一张毛主席像时说：“我愿意当一个毛泽东的战士。毛泽东思想为我们革命人民开辟了一条光明的道路。”
    一位名叫杜库尔的马里观众在留言簿上写道：“我们向尊敬的毛泽东主席致敬”。他说：“毛泽东也是属于我们的，因为他领导着我们无产阶级的伟大事业，领导着我们进行反对无产阶级的共同敌人：帝国主义、反动派和机会主义的斗争。我们无产阶级的伟大导师毛泽东万岁！”
    一位农场的工人在留言簿上写道：“让我们向毛泽东思想的伟大红旗致敬，祝伟大领袖、伟大舵手毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”
