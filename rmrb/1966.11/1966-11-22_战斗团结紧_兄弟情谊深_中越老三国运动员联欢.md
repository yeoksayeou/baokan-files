Pan Yuandan pointed out that the holding of the first Asian New Emerging Forces Games is a major victory in the anti-U.S. struggle of the Asian peoples. He expressed his determination to contribute to the success of the Asian New Emerging Forces Games. Feng Sa said in his speech that the participation of the Laotian Patriotic Front Party sports delegation in this Asian New Emerging Forces Games shows that the Laotian Patriotic Front Party enjoys its own international status. They are representing the Laotian people to participate in this sports meet. This is a victory for the Laotian people.

The gathering was filled with the spirit of comradeship and brotherly affection. Athletes from the three countries sat together with their counterparts, sharing stories of their fighting friendship and exchanging experiences in sports.

At the gathering, Vietnamese and Laotian athletes expressed their sincere love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. They eagerly sought out the colorful portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform and wearing a red guard armband, which was displayed in the venue.

Chinese athletes, with a deep affection for the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, sang "In Praise of Ho Chi Minh," expressing their most resolute support for Chairman Ho's call to carry the anti-U.S. struggle to the end.

The gathering was filled with joy and friendship from beginning to end, with songs of struggle echoing throughout.

The gathering ended with the majestic song "Unity Is Strength." The athletes from the three countries encouraged each other as they parted, to hold high the banner of unity against imperialism, to help each other, and to strive together to contribute their strength to the success of the first Asian New Emerging Forces Games.
