Title: Experiences in Addressing Living Thoughts

I deeply feel that addressing living thoughts is the most important and most frequent task of a political instructor. Only by addressing living thoughts, understanding the ideological trends of cadres and community members, and organizing cadres and community members to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, can we unify the thoughts of cadres and community members with Mao Zedong Thought and solve practical problems in life, thus doing a good job in political and ideological work.

Addressing living thoughts requires seeing big problems from small issues.

Our brigade has a member named Gu Yinwa, who used to often quarrel with her mother-in-law and husband, and would leave home to her parents' place and not participate in production. I originally thought this was a family issue and did not pay much attention. Later, several more incidents of disputes between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and husbands and wives occurred, and I realized that this small family matter had a big problem behind it. Women make up half of the labor force, and if their problems are not solved well, it will seriously affect collective production.

I thought about it and felt that to solve such family conflicts, we must instill Mao Zedong Thought in them. The specific method is to first set an example. Our brigade has many mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law who, after studying Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," knew that for a common revolutionary goal, comrades from all over the country can unite well, and a family should also work together to improve family relations and collective production. After adequate preparation, we separately held meetings for mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, first letting those with good mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships share their experiences of solving family problems with Mao Zedong Thought. Those with poor relationships were very moved. I seized this opportunity to talk about the style that a socialist family should have, inspiring the awakening of Gu Yinwa and others. They voluntarily criticized their past shortcomings and promised to maintain family harmony and work wholeheartedly for the collective. Gu Yinwa changed quickly and soon became the leader of a work team. The entire brigade showed a new atmosphere of family harmony and unity towards the collective. Gu Yinwa's mother-in-law happily said, "Chairman Mao's method is really good; the cadres have done ideological work in my home."

Addressing living thoughts requires paying attention to the good beginnings of advanced thoughts.

In 1964, before weeding cotton, we did sufficient political mobilization work. However, on the first day of weeding cotton seedlings, an incident occurred. Female community member Jiang Songxiang found the work team leader and said, "I was careless and weeded out a good cotton seedling. I really feel bad. The cotton seedling has already grown seven or eight leaves, and keeping it would at least produce a dozen bolls. This clearly shows that I do not love the collective enough! You can deduct my work points to cure this carelessness." This was originally a good beginning of an advanced thought, but the work team leader still deducted her work points according to the regulations. After discussing with the brigade committee members, we believed that not only should we not deduct her points, but we should also praise her. The reason is that she not only felt heartbroken for weeding out a cotton seedling but also voluntarily told the work team leader about this incident, which is the beginning of progress, and she would not be careless in her work in the future. Therefore, we held a community meeting called "One Cotton Seedling," praising Jiang Songxiang's thought of cherishing a cotton seedling. Through discussion, many community members were moved. Song Funu and others also weeded out several cotton seedlings and did not feel heartbroken, burying the seedlings in the soil. They made self-criticisms at the meeting and decided to learn from Jiang Songxiang. Other community members also made commitments to learn from Jiang Songxiang and cherish every seedling. We seized this opportunity to create an atmosphere of doing good deeds and striving for advancement, which greatly promoted the ideological revolution of the community members and continuously improved the quality of agricultural work. Later, there were very few incidents of damaged seedlings and leaves. The community members said, "This community meeting about one cotton seedling was really good. One person and one incident raised everyone's socialist awareness by a step."

Addressing living thoughts requires addressing representative living thoughts.

During the "Five Good" competition in 1964, a sister brigade promoted the "March 8th" style, weeding cotton fields quickly and well. The brigade cadres introduced the sister brigade's experience to the community members, and everyone expressed a desire to catch up with the advanced brigade. However, some people thought that our brigade's cotton fields were weeded well enough and worked slowly without much effort. Li Du'er was one of them. She was eloquent, skilled in work, but unwilling to put in effort, and many people had no way to deal with her. The party branch discussed and believed that Li Du'er was representative, and as long as her thoughts were clarified, it would be possible to educate those with similar thoughts.

How to persuade and educate Li Du'er? Just in time, the brigade inspected production and organized various brigades to evaluate each other. We mobilized her to participate in the "inspection." Li Du'er went to the third and seventh brigades, which had higher weeding quality, and looked around. Finally, she drew a conclusion: her work was not as good as others'. After returning, she told everyone how high the weeding quality was in other brigades, how great the community members' enthusiasm was, and how fast the progress was. The brigade timely praised her attitude of learning from advanced experiences humbly. Her enthusiasm rose, and she took the lead in weeding cotton and creating a weeding sample. Community members listened to her propaganda, saw her sample, and were convinced, voluntarily weeding cotton according to high standards.

### 抓活思想的体会

    抓活思想的体会
    山西省曲沃县杨谈公社杨谈大队第二生产队政治指导员  王德海
    我深深体会到：抓活思想，是政治指导员最重要、最经常的任务。只有抓好活思想，掌握住干部和社员的思想动向，有的放矢地组织干部和社员活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想去统一干部和社员的思想，去解决实际生活中的问题，才能把政治思想工作做好。
  抓活思想，要由小问题看到大问题。
    我队有个古银娃，过去常和婆婆、爱人闹矛盾，一闹就走娘家，不参加生产。我原来以为这是属于社员的家庭问题，没有多理睬。后来又发生好几起婆媳、夫妻不和的事情，我才感到这家务小事背后有大问题。妇女占劳动力的一半，她们的问题如果解决不好，就会严重地影响集体生产。
    我想了一想，觉得要解决好这种家务矛盾，只有给她们灌输毛泽东思想。具体做法是先树标兵。我们队里有不少婆媳们，在学了毛主席《为人民服务》的文章以后，知道“为了一个共同的革命目标”，来自五湖四海的同志都团结得很好，一家人更应该齐心合力搞好家庭关系，搞好集体生产。经过充分的准备，我们分别召开了婆婆会和媳妇会，先由那些婆媳关系处理得好的人，介绍她们用毛泽东思想解决家庭问题的经验，婆媳关系不好的人听了很受感动。我抓住这个机会，大讲社会主义家庭应有的风格，启发古银娃等人的觉悟。她们自动检讨了过去的缺点，保证以后做到家庭和睦，一心为集体。古银娃变得很快，不久就担任了作业组长。全队也出现了家庭和睦、一心向集体的新气象。古银娃的婆婆高兴地说：“毛主席的办法真好，干部把思想工作做到我家里了。”
    抓活思想，要注意抓先进思想的好苗头。
    一九六四年锄棉花前，我们做了充分的政治动员工作，可是锄棉苗的头一天早上就发生了“质量事故”。女社员姜松香找到作业组长说：“我一时粗心大意，好好的一株棉苗叫我给锄掉了，心里实在不是滋味。棉苗已经长出七八个叶子，留下它至少也结十几个桃，这明明是热爱集体不够么！你扣我的工分吧，治治这个粗心病。”这本来是个先进思想的好苗头，可是作业组长还按规定办理要扣她的工分。我和队委会的同志研究后，认为不仅不能扣，还应当表扬。理由是她锄掉一株棉苗不仅感到心疼，还主动向作业组长讲了这件事情，就是进步的开头，以后做活就不会粗心大意了。因此，我们开了个“一株棉苗”的社员大会，表扬了姜松香心疼一株棉苗的好思想。经过讨论，感动了许多社员。宋福女等人也锄掉好几株棉苗，并没有感到心疼，把棉苗都埋到土下。她们在会上作了自我检查，决心向姜松香看齐。其他社员，也都提出保证要学习姜松香，疼爱每株苗。我们抓住这件事情，造成了一种做好事、争先进的风气，这就大大促进了社员思想革命化，不断地提高了农活质量，后来损苗伤叶的事很少再有过。社员们说：“这一株棉苗的社员大会开得真好，一人一事，把大家的社会主义觉悟都提高了一步。”
    抓活思想，要抓有代表性的活思想。
    一九六四年开展五好竞赛时，兄弟队大兴“三八”作风，棉田锄得又快又好。队干部向社员介绍了兄弟队的经验，大家表示要向先进队看齐。但是有些人却认为本队棉花地锄得满不错，慢腾腾地不加劲，社员李朵儿就是其中的一个。她能说会道，干活有两手，就是不愿下功夫，好多人对她没有办法。支部研究，认为李朵儿有代表性，只要把她的思想搞通，就能教育有类似思想的人。
    怎样说服教育李朵儿呢？正好大队检查生产，组织各队评比，我们动员她去参加“检查”。李朵儿到了锄花质量较高的三队和七队，左瞧右看，最后得出了一条结论：自己干得不如人家。回来以后，见人就说其他队锄苗质量如何如何高，社员干劲怎样怎样大，进度快得很。队里及时表扬了她虚心学习先进经验的态度。她的干劲起来了，担任了锄花小组长，还带头做出锄苗样板。社员听了她的宣传，看了她的样板，心服口服，自觉地按照高标准锄起棉花来。
