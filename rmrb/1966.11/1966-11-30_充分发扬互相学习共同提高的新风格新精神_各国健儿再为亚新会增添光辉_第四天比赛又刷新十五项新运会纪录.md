The fourth day of competitions in the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games took place today. Athletes from various countries demonstrated a new style and spirit of mutual learning, joint improvement, and prioritizing friendship over rankings. The broad audience pointed out that only a new type of sports meet held under the banner of "unity against imperialism" can have such distinctive characteristics.

The Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, watched today's basketball games and personally awarded prizes to the swimming champions on the basketball court.

Today, the swimming arena saw more victories. In six events, eight athletes broke four new competition records.

The men's 400-meter freestyle relay championship was won by the Chinese team. Li Lifeng from China won the women's 200-meter butterfly championship. The swimming arena was filled with a warm atmosphere of unity and friendship. When an athlete achieved a good result, everyone spontaneously went forward to congratulate them. After the competition, Cambodian athlete Xiansong felt discomfort in his limbs, and Chinese athletes Fu Daijin and Qiao Yuan immediately enthusiastically went to give him a massage.

The track and field events are nearing their end. In today's finals of seven events, athletes from various countries broke five new competition records. This was the day with the most new competition records broken in the track and field events of the Games.

The top three individual totals broke the new competition records. They were: Liu Dongtai (China, 1126 rings), Xu Huimin (China, 1123 rings), and Mei Shi (Vietnam, 1122 rings). Liu Dongtai and Xu Huimin placed Chairman Mao's quotations on the shooting stand during today's competition. When they reached the final shots, their teammates brought them Chairman Mao's quotation: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must not relax their fighting spirit in the slightest. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit and any thought of complacency are wrong." This strengthened their confidence in striving for victory.

The cycling competition on the race track began today. Although it rained heavily last night and the race track was still not completely drained, the athletes from various countries, with the determination to contribute to the cause of Asian people's unity and anti-imperialism, were all full of fighting spirit and achieved relatively good results, showcasing their style. Chen Wanzhi and Li Yufeng from China won the first places in the men's and women's 1,000-meter individual races held today.
