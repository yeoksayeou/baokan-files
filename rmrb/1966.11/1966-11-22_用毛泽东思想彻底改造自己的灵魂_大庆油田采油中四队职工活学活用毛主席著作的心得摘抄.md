The struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to change the world includes the tasks of transforming both the objective world and the subjective world—transforming one's cognitive abilities and the relationship between the subjective and objective worlds.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the soul, aiming to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought, transforming Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, a new wave of the masses studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has surged across the nation. The people of Daqing, under extremely difficult conditions, achieved great victories on the petroleum front, making Daqing Oilfield a model enterprise nationwide. This was achieved by relying on the "Two Articles" and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Now, the workers of Daqing Oilfield study Chairman Mao's works even better and apply them more effectively. Below are excerpts from the reflections of the workers of the Fourth Oil Extraction Team of Daqing Oilfield, a model unit on the petroleum front, on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to transform their worldviews.

	One Must Not Overlook Even Fleeting Selfish Thoughts

	Well Operator Hu Faliang

	Studying Chairman Mao's works first requires transforming one's thoughts, fiercely battling the "self" and uprooting selfish thoughts. Battling the "self" is not a one-time effort; it requires both decisive and sustained battles. Once, while working at a well, I noticed the oil pressure was higher than before by one atmosphere. I thought something was wrong. After closing the valve and checking, I found the pressure gauge was malfunctioning. At that time, it was raining heavily and windy outside. I thought, "Forget it! The oil pressure is just a static value; I'll just fill it in as usual." At that moment, I thought of Norman Bethune. He was extremely dedicated to his work. But me? Just because it was raining outside, I couldn't go and calibrate the pressure gauge? This was a selfish thought. So, I braved the rain and ran to the test well team to calibrate the pressure gauge.

	I feel that transforming thoughts requires self-awareness. The fact that selfish thoughts surfaced shows that I am still far from being "completely" and "thoroughly" aligned with the "two extremes." I repeatedly studied the essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Norman Bethune was extremely dedicated to his work. But me? A little wind and rain made me waver. The gap is huge! I felt ashamed and checked my thoughts with the leadership and comrades. From then on, the words "extreme" were etched in my mind, and in my work, I constantly battled against "non-extremism."

	I realized that to overcome the "self," one must have the examples of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains in mind, establishing a worldview of not seeking fame or personal gain, not fearing hardship or death, wholeheartedly for the revolution and the people. One must achieve: in thoughts, overcoming the "self" and establishing the "public"; in work, overcoming fear and establishing daring; in style, overcoming laziness and establishing rigor; in life, overcoming indulgence and establishing hardship. As long as I live in this world, I will battle the "self" every day, dedicate my life to the revolution, and battle the "self" for life.

	The Revolution of Thought Lies in Self-Awareness

	Apprentice Worker Gao Shuzhen

	On September 8th, I was on the 8 AM shift. Due to a lot of work, I was about to hand over the shift, but the cleaning was not done. I hurriedly wiped the equipment and swept the dust. When I got to behind the boiler, I thought, "No one will see this back area, today's time is tight, forget it, I'll clean it properly tomorrow." At that moment, Chairman Mao's teachings appeared before my eyes: "Being careless in work," "slacking off and getting by," are manifestations of liberalism. At the same time, I remembered what my team's petroleum department's model worker Hu Faliang said, "The 'self' is the enemy of the revolution. To be a good revolutionary successor, one must fiercely battle the 'self.' Not only must others help, but more importantly, one must self-awareness and battle." So, I went back behind the boiler and swept the floor clean. This was not just sweeping dust; it was cleaning the filthy personalism deep in my thoughts.

	Using Mao Zedong Thought to Overcome the "Self"

	Apprentice Worker He Ying

	This August, due to my careless and sloppy work, I caused two instances of low water levels in the boiler, nearly leading to a serious accident.

	At that time, I thought: I also want to do a good job, but why do problems keep happening? I couldn't understand it. Back in the dormitory, the more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt. I studied the section "The whole party must unite and struggle to fulfill the party's tasks" from "On Coalition Government." As I studied and reflected, I realized it was because I had nurtured arrogance and self-satisfaction, thinking that the electrical equipment previously managed by a fifth-level electrician was now being managed by me, an apprentice, and that minor problems were nothing. In the team meeting, I sincerely checked my thoughts, hoping comrades would help me uproot the twisted roots in my thoughts. Since then, I paid more attention to my thoughts, and my work improved.

	I realized: crude oil contains water, and it is not pure oil. If one's mind has selfish thoughts, one is not a true revolutionary. Removing water from crude oil requires electric field strength, demulsifier, and temperature. Removing selfish thoughts from oneself requires Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, one has the weapon to fiercely battle the "self." The more the "self" is overcome, the stronger the self-awareness to serve the people becomes, and the work can be raised to a new level.

	Abandoning Selfishness for the Revolution

	Yang Defu

	Recently, the team received forty work-study students. The students allocated to the first well team performed excellently and were praised by the party branch. The students in the third well team, wanting to learn from their revolutionary spirit, proposed a revolutionary competition. I found out and thought it was a good thing that should be strongly advocated. Originally, I wanted to propose it to the team, but then I thought, fearing others would say I was seeking attention, I did not suggest it to the team, thinking it was better to avoid trouble. This matter bothered me for more than a day, always feeling something was wrong. In the evening, while studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao said: "Norman Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and dedication to the people is manifested in his extreme responsibility to his work." Comparing myself to Norman Bethune, I felt the gap in my thoughts was too large. Norman Bethune was extremely responsible to his work, but me? I lacked a high sense of responsibility to revolutionary work. On this issue, I did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The next day, I immediately checked my selfish thoughts with the team leader and made work suggestions.

	Every Word and Deed Must Start from the Interests of the Whole Party

	Work-Study Student Gu Jiahua

	As the saying goes: difficulties are like springs; if you are strong, they weaken; if you are weak, they strengthen.

	Once, during a night shift, at five in the morning, I was extremely tired and wanted to go to the oil measurement room to sleep for ten minutes. So, I set the clock to ten past five, thinking that when the alarm rang, I would wake up. Just as I was about to do this, I remembered a passage from Chairman Mao's "Rectify the Party's Style of Work": "Every party member, every part of the work, every word or action, must start from the interests of the whole party and must not violate this principle." Reflecting on this sentence, I realized that if I did this, it was not starting from the party's interests to work. So, I gathered my spirits, thinking of Chairman Mao's words, thinking of the scene of the heroes of the 32111 drilling team rescuing the gas well, silently reciting: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

	Thus, I overcame my fatigue.

	Being Afraid of Others' Strict Demands Means One's Thoughts Are Relaxed

	Apprentice Worker Shi Guifang

	The comrades from the big class did not pull down the switch of the blower, and I did not discover it during the shift handover inspection. When Chang Qingwu took over the shift, he deducted twenty points from me for this. I was very upset. I thought: such a big post, just one switch not pulled down, and it was the big class's fault! After getting off work, the more I thought about it, the more I felt my thoughts were wrong. Chairman Mao said: "Since we serve the people, we should not be afraid of others pointing out our shortcomings." But me? Others pointed it out, and I couldn't understand. Although it was the big class's switch, I did not check it out, which means I was careless and sloppy, not fulfilling my duty to the people. Complaining about others' strict demands is actually one's own thoughts being relaxed. It's not that others are demanding too much, but that one's own thoughts are relaxed. In the future, one should welcome others' criticisms and suggestions in work, self-awareness and battle the "self." Use the "Three Articles" to transform oneself. Whether the "Three Articles" are studied well or not depends on how well the "self" is battled and how thoroughly selfish thoughts are uprooted. The "Three Articles" are the highest standard to examine our thoughts of serving the people.

	Only by Fiercely Battling the "Self" Will One Not Go Astray

	Zhang Yunxiang

	When cadres implemented the policy of going up and down, I just came down to the team. I had three low points: first, my mood was low, feeling embarrassed to see people because I was demoted from deputy instructor to worker; second, my enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works was low, thinking that as a cadre, not studying Chairman Mao's works made it hard to lead the team, but as a worker, studying a bit less was okay; third, my work enthusiasm was low, only appearing during work hours, and the team hardly saw me. Therefore, in the few days after coming down, the masses reflected: although Old Zhang came down, he was hardly seen, his thoughts were still in the team headquarters, and after getting off work, he rushed home.

	After the party branch pointed out this problem to me, I studied "In the Service of the People" with this problem in mind. As soon as I read it, my face felt hot. Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party and the revolutionary army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary forces. Our army is completely for the people's liberation, working thoroughly for the people's interests." The more I read, the more ashamed I felt. Reflecting on these few days of work, except for work hours, I did not enter the team, was this completely and thoroughly serving the people? The next day, I checked my thoughts in the team meeting.

	Through this incident, I deeply realized that one must battle the "self" for life in the revolution. Each victory in the battle is a step forward. Using the "Three Articles" as weapons to battle the "self," one can continuously advance on the path of revolutionization.

    用毛泽东思想彻底改造自己的灵魂
    ——大庆油田采油中四队职工活学活用毛主席著作的心得摘抄
    无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想化为自己灵魂的大革命。随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动掀起了一个新高潮。大庆人在极端困难的条件下，所以能够在石油战线上打了大胜仗，大庆油田所以成为全国企业的先进典型，就是靠“两论”起家的，就是活学活用毛主席著作的结果。现在，大庆油田职工对毛主席著作学的更好，用的更好了。下面就是石油战线五好红旗单位标兵、大庆油田采油中四队活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观的心得摘抄。
            ——编者
    一闪即过的私心杂念也不能放过
    井长　胡法莲
    学习毛主席著作，首先要改造自己的思想，狠斗“我”字，狠挖私心杂念。斗“我”字不能一劳永逸，既要打歼灭战，也要打持久战。一次，我在某井上班，发现油压比过去高了一个大气压，觉得有问题。一关闸门检查，油压表失灵了。那时外边下着大雨，刮着大风，我心里想：算了吧！反正油压是个死数据，就照老样子填写吧。当时，面前出现了白求恩。他对工作极端负责。可我呢？外边下着大雨就不能去校对压力表吗？这就是私心杂念。于是我冒着大雨，跑到试井队校对好了油压表。
    我觉得，改造思想要靠自觉，私心杂念所以冒了一下，说明自己离“完全”、“彻底”、两个“极端”还有差距。我带着这个问题反复学习了《纪念白求恩》一文。白求恩同志对工作极端的负责任。而我呢？一点风雨就动摇了。这个差距该有多大！我心里很惭愧，向领导和同志们检查了自己的思想。打那时候起，“极端”两个字刻在我脑子里了，在工作中专跟“不极端”斗。
    我体会到，要想斗倒“我”字，脑子里就要装上张思德、白求恩、老愚公这三个人，树立不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民的世界观，做到：思想上要斗倒“我”字，树立“公”字；工作上要斗倒“怕”字，树立“闯”字；作风上要斗倒“拖”字，树立“硬”字；生活上要斗倒“享”字，树立“苦”字。我活在世界上一天，就要和“我”字斗一天，干一辈子革命，斗一辈子“我”字。
    思想革命贵在自觉
    学徒工　高树臻
    九月八日，我上八点的班。由于工作很多，眼看就要交接班了，卫生还没有搞。我急急忙忙擦设备，扫灰尘。扫到锅炉后面时，心想：反正没人看这背地方，今天时间紧，算了，明天再好好扫一扫。这时，毛主席的教导出现在眼前：“办事不认真”，“敷衍了事，得过且过”，是自由主义的表现。同时又想起了我队石油部五好标兵胡法莲同志说过，“我”字是革命的大敌，当好革命接班人，必须狠斗“我”字。不但要别人帮着斗，更重要的是自觉地斗；越是单独值勤，没有领导和同志在场的情况下，越要严字当头，高标准要求自己。于是，我又拐进锅炉背后，把地扫得干干净净。这扫的不是灰尘，是我思想深处的又臭又脏的个人主义。
    靠毛泽东思想斗倒“我”字
    学徒工　何英
    今年八月份，由于我工作不严不细，造成了两次锅炉低水位，险些引起严重事故。
    这时我心里想：我也想干好工作，可为啥老出问题，一时想不通。回到宿舍越想越不舒服，我就学习《论联合政府》里的“全党团结起来，为实现党的任务而斗争”一节。边学边对照，原来是由于自己滋长了骄傲自满情绪，认为以前五级电工管的电器设备，现在我一个学徒也管下来了，出点小问题也没有啥。在班组会上，我认真做了检查，希望同志们给我帮助，狠挖思想上的歪根。由于思想重视了，以后工作也就干好了。
    我体会到：原油里含水，就不是纯油，脑子里有私心杂念，就不是真正的革命者。去掉原油里的水，要靠电场强度、脱乳剂和温度。个人去掉私心杂念，要靠毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，就有了狠斗“我”字的武器。“我”字斗倒一分，为人民服务的自觉性就增强一分，工作就能提高到一个新的水平。
    抛掉私心为革命
    杨德福
    最近队里来了四十名工读学生。分配在一井组的同学干得很出色，受到党支部的表扬。三井组的同学为了学习他们的革命干劲，提出了革命竞赛。我发现后，觉得是一件好事，应该大力提倡。本来想给队里提出来，但又一想，怕别人说自己出风头，就没有向队里建议，觉得多一事不如少一事。这件事情在心里憋了一天多，总觉得不对头，晚上学习《纪念白求恩》，毛主席说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任。”对照白求恩，感到自己思想差距太大了。白求恩同志对工作是极端的负责任，而我呢？对革命工作缺乏高度的责任感。在这一个问题上，自己没有照毛主席的指示去做。第二天，我马上向队长检查了自己的私心杂念，并提了工作上的建议。
    一言一行必须以全党利益为出发点
    工读学生　顾家华
    俗话说得好：困难好比弹簧，你强它就弱，你弱它就强。
    有次上夜班，早晨五点钟时我困得非常不好受，想去量油房睡上十分钟。于是，我把表拨到五点十分那里，到点表铃一响我不就醒了吗？正想这么做，可是就在这一瞬间，我想起了毛主席在《整顿党的作风》一文中的一段话：“每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”对照这句话检查自己的思想，才知道自己要这样做，根本不是以党的利益为出发点去工作的。于是我就提起精神，心里想着毛主席的话，想着32111钻井队英雄们抢救气井的情景，默念着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    就这样，我战胜了困倦。
    怕别人要求严就是自己思想松
    学徒工　史桂芳
    大班的同志没有把压风机的闸刀拉下来，我在交接班检查中也没有发现。常庆武接班时，因为这件事扣我二十分。我很想不通。我想：一个那么大的岗位，就一个闸刀没有拉下来，而且是大班的人弄的！下班以后，越想越感到我这种思想不对头。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”可我呢？别人提出来就想不通。虽然是大班合的闸刀，可是我没有检查出来，这就是工作不严不细，没有做到向人民负责。嫌别人要求严，实际上就是自己思想松。不是别人要求严了，而是自己思想松了。今后应该在工作中欢迎别人批评提意见，自己自觉斗“我”字。用“老三篇”来改造自己，“老三篇”学习得好不好，就看“我”字斗得如何，私心杂念斗得彻底不彻底。“老三篇”是检验我们为人民服务的思想的最高标准。
    只有狠斗“我”字才不会走错路
    张运祥
    干部实行一上一下，我刚下到班组时，有三个低落：一是思想情绪低落，认为自己原来是副指导员，现在成了工人，见了人就不好意思；二是学习毛主席著作劲头低落，认为原来当干部不学毛主席著作没法带队伍，当工人学得差点可以；三是工作干劲低落，除了上班外，班组里看不到我。因此刚下去几天，群众就反映说：老张虽然下来了，但总是见不到他，思想还在队部里，下班就往家跑。
    支部给我提出这个问题后，我带着这个问题学习了《为人民服务》，刚一看，脸上就热辣辣的。毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我越看越觉得惭愧。回想起这几天的工作，除了上班外就不进班组，这种思想是完全彻底为人民服务吗？第二天我就在班组会上作了检查。
    通过这件事，我深刻体会到，革命一生就要和“我”字斗争一生，每斗胜一次，就前进一步，把“老三篇”作为向“我”字斗争的武器，这样才能在革命化的大道上不断前进。
