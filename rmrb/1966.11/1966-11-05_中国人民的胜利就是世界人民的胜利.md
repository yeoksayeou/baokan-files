Their speeches were met with prolonged, enthusiastic applause from the audience.

	President Muabi pointed out that China's achievement is not only a victory for the brave Chinese people but also a victory for the people of all countries. We are thrilled by this. This achievement of the Chinese people has given a stern warning to those who consider themselves the masters of the world.

	Prime Minister Numa pointed out that some big countries are brazenly attacking small countries, and the American imperialists are still invading Vietnam, so we are genuinely happy about China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on November 3, the people of various African countries continue to celebrate China's successful nuclear missile launch and believe it to be a great achievement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In a military camp of the People's Militia in Brazzaville, the capital of Congo (Brazzaville), militia members held an evening celebration upon hearing the news. Many militiamen and youths told reporters: "China's achievement is a great encouragement to the people of Congo and Africa, and a heavy blow to the revolutionary enemies." Some militiamen said, "China's achievement has 'dampened the arrogance of American imperialism and modern revisionism, making them tremble with fear.' They said: 'Your achievement is our achievement. The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are a powerful supporter of the oppressed people of the world.'

	Muhammed Mao, a teacher from Somalia, wrote in a letter to Xinhua News Agency: "The success of China's missile and nuclear weapon tests is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. China has broken the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union. China's nuclear weapons do not belong to China alone, but to all oppressed and peace-loving peoples."

	The Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Legal Workers' Conference issued a statement in Conakry on November 2, saying: "The achievement of the Chinese people has greatly boosted the courage and confidence of the people of Asia and Africa who are fighting for liberation. The statement said: 'This achievement is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also a victory for the people of the world.'

	Konyama Chakara, the national chairman of the Basutoland Congress Party, expressed his warm congratulations to our ambassador to Tanzania, He Ying, saying: "This successful test has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and shows that China has reached the pinnacle of science."

	A Mauritanian employee congratulated China on the successful launch of missiles and nuclear weapons in a letter, saying: "Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have once again achieved victory. The thought of the respected and beloved leader Mao Zedong is the source and foundation of these achievements. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Chinese people and the world proletariat's wise and respected leader, Chairman Mao Zedong."

	Himyar bin Suleiman, the representative of the Oman office in Cairo, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Cairo on November 2: "The remarkable achievements China has made in such a short time since liberation are first and foremost due to the great leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the heroic Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

	He pointed out: "China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests are a great encouragement to the fighting people of Oman and the Arab world."
