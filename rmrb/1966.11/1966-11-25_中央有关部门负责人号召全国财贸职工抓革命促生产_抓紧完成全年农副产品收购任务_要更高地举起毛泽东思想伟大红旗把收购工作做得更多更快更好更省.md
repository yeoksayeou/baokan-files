In the face of a bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline products, it is essential to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize the revolution, promote production, concentrate forces to fight a battle of annihilation, and strive to complete this year's agricultural and sideline products procurement plan in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. This is a major task for the financial and commercial departments at present.

Since entering the peak procurement season for agricultural and sideline products this year, the vast number of financial and commercial workers across the country, with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, have seized the revolution with one hand and procurement with the other, resulting in a very good situation in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. By the beginning of November, the procurement plans for grain, cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and hemp in the country have all been completed by more than 60 to 70 percent. The procurement volume of many major agricultural and sideline products has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. For example, cotton has increased by 17 percent, hemp by 23 percent, flue-cured tobacco by 28 percent, and live pigs by 13 percent. The quality of the various agricultural and sideline products that have been procured has also improved compared to last year.

In the procurement of agricultural and sideline products this year, various financial and commercial departments have emphasized politics and emphasized Mao Zedong Thought. Many procurement departments have insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works during the peak season of busy work and have turned various agricultural and sideline products procurement stations into big schools of Mao Zedong Thought. They actively organized the broad masses of community members to study Chairman Mao's works and propagandized to the masses Chairman Mao's instructions on preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, as well as the state's procurement policies, so that many community members not only sold their agricultural and sideline products here but also received education in Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the broad financial and commercial workers have conscientiously implemented the mass line in the procurement work, handed over policies to the masses, told the masses the methods and requirements, and relied on the masses to do things. In some regions, when procuring cotton, the cotton inspection standards were given to the masses in advance, and the production teams themselves ginned the cotton, inspected the quality, and packaged it, and then handed it over to the state for sale. This method was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of community members. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The state trusts us and relies on us, so we must be responsible to the state and sell good cotton to the state to support socialist construction."

According to a responsible person from the relevant central leading departments, the overall situation of agricultural and sideline products procurement across the country is very good, but the requirements for work are now higher, and further efforts are needed to fully complete the procurement tasks for various agricultural and sideline products. At present, it is a critical moment for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. Time waits for no man. While doing a good job in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, necessary forces should be concentrated to grasp the procurement work of agricultural and sideline products with the method of fighting a battle of annihilation, and strive for double victories in the Cultural Revolution and procurement work. Chairman Mao said, "In the world, the most feared words are 'seriousness.' The Communist Party is the most serious about 'seriousness.'"

Chairman Mao also said, "Only by grasping something very tightly and without letting go can it be grasped. If you grasp it but not tightly, it is as good as not grasping it at all." The responsible person requires that all levels of financial and commercial departments must firmly grasp the four characters of "seriousness" and "tightness," further improve the two sets of leadership for revolution and production, and strengthen the leadership over the Cultural Revolution and procurement work. While doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, they should also do a good job in sending industrial products to the countryside and strengthening the management of market trade.

The responsible person of the relevant central leading departments stressed that of all the rules, the first and foremost is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. The broad financial and commercial workers must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify their thoughts and actions. They must firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, ride the east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and push the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works among the financial and commercial workers to a new stage. In particular, they should study the "Three Articles" thoroughly, apply them actively, break down the "self" thoroughly, establish the "public" thoroughly, strive to transform their world outlook, accelerate the revolutionization of people's ideology, and use ideological revolutionization to promote all work, so that all work can be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

The peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, standing at their doorsteps, see the whole of China and the whole world. The peasants of Fangxiang Brigade in Hanzhong County, Jiangsu Province, have greatly improved their ideological awareness by studying Chairman Mao's works. They enthusiastically sell their surplus grain to the state to support national construction. This is a scene of community members studying Chairman Mao's quotations before sending grain.

    中央有关部门负责人号召全国财贸职工抓革命促生产
    抓紧完成全年农副产品收购任务
    要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗把收购工作做得更多更快更好更省
    据新华社二十四日讯　在农副产品全面丰收的大好形势下，继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，集中力量打歼灭战，争取多快好省地完成全年的农副产品收购计划，这是当前财贸部门的一项重要任务。
    今年进入农副产品收购旺季以来，全国广大财贸职工以文化大革命为纲，一手抓革命，一手抓收购，促使农副产品收购出现了一派大好形势。到十一月上旬止，全国粮食、棉花、烤烟、麻类的收购计划都已完成百分之六十到七十以上。许多主要农副产品的收购量比去年同期显著增加。如：棉花比去年同期增加百分之十七，麻类增加百分之二十三，烤烟增加百分之二十八，生猪增加百分之十三。已经收购的各种农副产品的质量也比去年提高。
    各地财贸部门在今年的农副产品收购工作中，大力突出政治，突出毛泽东思想。许多收购部门在旺季大忙中坚持学习毛主席著作，还把各种农副产品收购站办成毛泽东思想的大学校。他们积极组织广大社员学习毛主席著作，向群众宣传毛主席关于备战、备荒、为人民的指示和国家的收购政策，使许多社员在这里既出售了农副产品，又受到了毛泽东思想的教育。
    广大财贸职工遵照毛主席的教导，在收购工作中认真贯彻了群众路线，把政策交给群众，把做法和要求告诉群众，依靠群众办事。有些地区在收购棉花时，事先把棉花检验标准交给群众，由生产队自己轧花，自己检验质量，自己打包，然后集中起来向国家交售。这种做法受到广大社员的热烈欢迎。许多贫下中农社员说，国家这样相信我们，依靠我们，我们就要对国家负责，把好棉花卖给国家，支援社会主义建设。
    据中央有关领导部门负责人说：全国农副产品收购，总的说来是一派大好形势，但是现在工作的要求更高了，要全面地完成各项农副产品收购任务，还要进一步努力。目前正是农副产品收购的关键时刻，机不可失，时不再来，各地应当以“只争朝夕”的精神，争分夺秒，在抓好文化大革命的同时，集中必要的力量，用打歼灭战的办法，狠抓农副产品的收购工作，争取文化革命和收购工作双胜利。毛主席说：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”
    毛主席又说：“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”负责人要求各级财贸部门必须牢牢掌握“认真”、“抓紧”四个字，进一步健全革命和生产两套班子，加强对文化革命和收购工作的领导。在抓好农副产品收购的同时，还要抓好工业品下乡和加强集市贸易管理等工作。
    中央有关领导部门的负责人强调指出，千条万条，活学活用毛主席著作是第一条。广大财贸职工必须用毛泽东思想来统一思想，统一行动。必须坚决响应林彪同志的号召，乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，把财贸部门学习毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段。特别要大学“老三篇”，活学活用，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，努力改造世界观，加速人的思想革命化，以思想革命化带动一切工作，使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。（附图片）
    毛泽东思想武装的中国农民，站在家门口，看到全中国，看到全世界。江苏省邗江县方巷大队社员，大学毛主席著作，思想觉悟大大提高，他们踊跃向国家交售公余粮，支援国家建设。这是社员们在送粮前学习毛主席语录。
