	Study Chairman Mao's Quotations: Be Like Comrade White as Selfless and Dedicated
	Broadcast by the Guidance Team of the Fifth Brigade, Wuli Bridge, Nanxiong Commune, Yongfu County, Guangxi

	(1) Read the Quotation: “Comrade White was selfless and dedicated to the people. This spirit is shown in his extreme responsibility towards his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people.” “Every Communist Party member must learn the spirit of true communism from Comrade White.”

	(2) Explanation: This quotation is taken from the article “In Memory of White.” “In Memory of White” was written by Chairman Mao on December 21, 1939, to commemorate Comrade White.

	Comrade White indeed embodied this spirit. He was extremely responsible in his work and had extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people.

	Once, he performed surgery on a wounded soldier who had lost too much blood and needed a transfusion. Although he was very thin, he insisted on donating blood to the soldier, ultimately giving 300 milliliters of fresh blood, saving the soldier’s life.

	One winter, Comrade White rode a horse for over 110 miles through the mountains, his entire body covered in snow. However, as soon as he arrived at his destination, he immediately went to inspect the ward, checking on over 30 wounded soldiers in one breath. When he discovered that a soldier’s leg wound was infected, he said excitedly, “For such excellent soldiers, we must take extra care. We must endure a little more hardship and hunger, but we cannot let the wounded suffer.” He immediately performed surgery on the soldier, not eating until midnight.

	Once, he learned that a village near the enemy had dozens of wounded soldiers. Despite the danger, he repeatedly requested to go to the village to rescue the wounded. Later, he was surrounded by the enemy but managed to escape with the help of the troops. In that tense moment, he calmly said, “Medical work is to be with the soldiers, and it is glorious even if one sacrifices their life.”

	Comrades! Comrade White was so extremely responsible in his work and had such extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. He was truly selfless and dedicated to the people. This is such a noble communist spirit!

	“Selfless and dedicated to the people” is the fundamental characteristic of a communist worldview. Only those who have established a communist worldview can be extremely responsible in their work and have extreme enthusiasm for their comrades and the people. To establish a communist worldview, the most fundamental thing is to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness. When faced with a task, is it for the public good or for personal gain? This is a question that everyone in the socialist era encounters and must answer at every moment.

	Take our commune members, for example. A good load of fertilizer, should it be used in the private plot or handed over to the collective? When cutting grain today, do you choose the dry field or the muddy field? When working, do you prioritize work points or quality? When picking up a handful of grain, do you take it home to feed the chickens or hand it over to the collective? During distribution, do you advocate dividing everything up and eating it all, or do you first consider the needs of the state and the collective? Again, take our militia members, for example. If war breaks out, do you fear for your life and only think of your family, or do you persist in fighting and resolutely strike back at the enemy?

	In short, no matter what we do, there is always a question of public versus private. We must answer this question with our actions. Public and private often clash in our minds. We emphasize political education and study Chairman Mao’s works to use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the “self” in our minds, to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to be like Comrade White, selfless and dedicated to the people, and truly establish a communist worldview. In this regard, heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yang Hai, Jiao Yulu, Mai Xian De, and Liu Ying Jun have set brilliant examples for us.

	Since our brigade started studying Chairman Mao’s works, many selfless and dedicated good deeds have emerged. For example, Liao Chang Sa led the way in cutting grain in the muddy field, helped other teams stack grain during lunch breaks, and after work, when it was almost dark, she did not hesitate to help the brigade carry grain, never minding the work points. Wu Xiao Ba, when it was dark and time to go home, saw his wife and Liao Lian Sa carrying grain across the river together, immediately dropped his plow and ox, not helping his wife, but rushed to help Liao Lian Sa carry the grain across the river. The 60-year-old Li Zhong Rong, who takes care of two children at home and cooks for the family, voluntarily boils water for the brigade and delivers it to the fields, not asking the brigade to record work points. Now, everyone is competing to do good deeds of “breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, sacrificing for others.” In the past ten days, our brigade has had over 50 people do 143 good deeds.

	However, there are still some people who are not like this. They are like what Chairman Mao criticized: “Irresponsible in work, picking the easy tasks and pushing the heavy ones to others. When faced with a task, they first think of themselves and then of others.” They also say, “If one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth.” They believe that one’s “self” can never be broken, and the two “extremes” can never be achieved. This view is completely wrong. Heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Liu Ying Jun have not completely changed their selfishness and achieved the two “extremes”?

	I also had a lot of “self” in the past. For example, last time I went to Ping Le for a visit, the miscellaneous work compensation fee given by the higher authorities should have been handed over to the brigade, but I used the money for myself. Later, I studied Chairman Mao’s works and realized that this was because the “self” in me was acting up, so I resolutely fought against the “self” in me. I study Chairman Mao’s works every day and fight against the “self” every day. Slowly, the “public” in my mind increased, and the “self” decreased. I found that my wife wanted to use the silkworm dung in the private plot, so I firmly fought against her selfish behavior, and in the end, the silkworm dung was handed over to the brigade. I knew that some commune members lacked food, so I immediately lent out 100 pounds of grain to support two poor peasant commune members. I think that as long as one has a genuine revolutionary spirit, “selfishness” can be changed. We strive to read Chairman Mao’s books, listen to Chairman Mao’s words, and act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions. We must fight against the “self” and “I” in our minds every day and every moment, so we can overcome the “self” and “I” and establish the “public,” be like Comrade White, with no selfishness and self-interest, and become a true communist who is selfless and dedicated to the people. We should strive to do this.

	(3) Discussion: (1) In what aspects does Comrade White’s selfless and dedicated communist spirit manifest? What are the gaps between us and him? (2) How should we establish the spirit of “selfless and dedicated to the people” and achieve the two “extremes”?

### 像白求恩同志那样毫不利己专门利人

专栏：学习毛主席语录辅导

    像白求恩同志那样毫不利己专门利人
    广西永福南雄公社五里桥三队辅导员　徐小祥
    （一）读语录：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”“每一个共产党员，一定要学习白求恩同志的这种真正共产主义者的精神。”
    （二）讲解：这条语录是从《纪念白求恩》这篇文章里摘录出来的。《纪念白求恩》是毛主席在一九三九年十二月二十一日，为纪念白求恩同志而写的。
    白求恩同志的确是这样，他对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱。
    有一次，他为一个伤员做手术，这个伤员流血太多，需要输血。他虽然身体很瘦，但他一再要求为伤员输血，结果输了三百毫升鲜血，使这个战士获得了第二次生命。
    有一个冬天，白求恩同志一天骑马走了一百一十多里山路，全身都是雪花。但是，他一到住地马上就去检查病房，一口气检查了三十多个伤病员。当他发现一个伤员腿上的伤口发臭时，激动地说：“对于这样优秀的战士，我们必须加倍爱护。宁可自己累一点，饿一点，不能让伤员受痛苦。”他马上为这个伤员动手术，直到深夜十二点钟才吃饭。
    有一次，他知道接近敌人的一个村庄有几十个伤员，便冒着生命危险，一再请求去这个村庄抢救伤员，后来被敌人包围，经过部队的掩护，才脱了险。在那紧张的时刻，他十分沉着地说：“军医工作就是要和战士们在一起，就是牺牲了也是光荣的。”
    同志们！白求恩同志对工作这样极端的负责任，对同志对人民这样极端的热忱，真是毫不利己专门利人。这是多么高尚的共产主义风格啊！
    “毫不利己专门利人”，这是共产主义世界观的根本标志。只有树立了共产主义世界观的人，才能做到“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”。要树立共产主义世界观，最根本的一条就是要破私立公。一事当前，是为公，还是为私？这是我们社会主义时代，每一个人每时每刻都会遇到的问题，都要回答的问题。
    就拿我们社员来说吧，一担好肥料，是用到自留地，还是交给队里集体用？今天割禾，你是选干田割，还是选烂泥田割？干活的时候，你是工分第一，还是质量第一？拣得一把禾穗，你是拿回家喂鸡，还是交给队里？在分配时，你是主张分光吃光，还是首先照顾国家和集体的需要？又如我们民兵，如果打起仗来，你是贪生怕死，只顾个人家庭，还是坚持斗争，坚决打击敌人？
    总之，我们不管做什么事，都有一个为公为私的问题，我们都要用实际行动来回答。公和私，经常在我们的脑子里打架。我们突出政治，大学毛主席著作，就是要用毛泽东思想在脑子里同“私”字作斗争，破“私”立“公”，像白求恩同志那样毫不利己专门利人，真正树立起共产主义世界观。在这方面，雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、焦裕禄、麦贤得、刘英俊等英雄人物，为我们做出了光辉的榜样。
    我们队里自从学习毛主席著作以来，也出现了许多毫不利己专门利人的好人好事。例如：廖长嫂带头选割烂泥田的禾，中午休息时帮助别组堆禾草，收工天快黑了，不顾给小孩喂奶，又帮队里挑谷子，从不计较工分。伍小八在天黑收工的时候，看到自己爱人同廖连嫂一起挑谷子过河，马上丢下犁和牛，不去帮助爱人，却去抢着帮廖连嫂挑谷子过河。六十多岁的李中荣老人，在家带两个小孩，还要为一家人煮饭，还主动给队里烧开水送到田头，不要队里记工分。现在，大家都争着做“破私立公、舍己为人”的好人好事。最近十多天来，我们队里已有五十多人做了一百四十三件好事。
    但是，也还有一些人不是这样。他们就像毛主席批评的那样：“对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”他们还说：“人不为己，天诛地灭。”认为人的“私”字永远不能破掉，两个“极端”永远无法做到。这种看法是十分错误的。雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄、刘英俊等英雄人物，不是彻底改掉了私心，做到了两个“极端”吗？
    我原来也有不少“私”字，比如前次我去平乐参观，上级发给我的误工补助费，本应该交给队里，可是我把这些钱私自用了。后来我学习毛主席著作，知道这是只顾个人的“私”字在作怪，就坚决同自己的“私”字作斗争。我天天学毛主席著作，天天斗“私”字，慢慢地我脑子里的“公”字多了，“私”字就少了。我发现爱人要把蚕粪用到自留地去，就坚决同她的自私行为作斗争，结果把蚕粪交给了队里。我知道有的社员缺少口粮，就马上借出一百斤粮食支援了两户贫农社员。我想，一个人只要有真心革命，“私”心是可以改掉的。我们努力读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，狠斗脑子里的“私”字、“我”字，天天斗，时时斗，就可以斗倒“私”字、“我”字，树立“公”字，像白求恩同志那样毫无自私自利之心，成为毫不利己专门利人的共产主义者。我们应该朝着这个方向努力去做。
      （三）讨论：（1）白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神表现在那些方面？我们和他比较有那些差距？（2）我们应当怎样树立“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，做到两个“极端”？
