The Vietnamese Committee to Investigate U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam has lodged a blood-curdling indictment. The U.S. aggressors have committed heinous crimes in Vietnam. No amount of barbarity can save the U.S. from defeat, nor can it shake the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people.

U.S. imperialism and all other vermin have already prepared their own gravediggers. Their days of being buried are not far off.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi on the 19th, the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Committee to Investigate U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam published a document titled "U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam" on October 31. This document, divided into four parts, exposes with substantial evidence the U.S. imperialists' atrocities in the Vietnam War, including the mass murder of innocent people and the use of chemical warfare. A summary of the document is as follows:

A U.S. expeditionary force of 330,000 troops, equipped with 3,400 aircraft of various types, 2,000 heavy artillery pieces, and thousands of armored vehicles, with the support of approximately 50,000 troops from South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand, is waging a war in South Vietnam, 13,000 kilometers away from the U.S. mainland. Aircraft from the U.S. Seventh Fleet and various bases in South Vietnam and Thailand are constantly bombing and strafing both North and South Vietnam.

The brutality of this war is unprecedented. The U.S. aggressors' evil deeds can only be compared to the crimes of Hitler's fascism.

In 1965, U.S. imperialism dropped 250,000 tons of bombs in Vietnam. In June 1966, they dropped 61,000 tons, and in July, 91,000 tons. According to a report from the U.S. News Agency, McNamara revealed that in the second half of 1966, the average monthly bomb tonnage dropped in Vietnam exceeded the average monthly tonnage dropped in Europe and Africa during World War II.

In addition to aerial bombing, U.S. imperialism also used the cannons of its Seventh Fleet warships to indiscriminately shell villages.

U.S. imperialism also used B-52 strategic bombers from the Guam base to conduct indiscriminate bombing. According to a United Press International report, by September 14, 1966, B-52 aircraft had flown 5,000 sorties, dropping approximately 100,000 tons of bombs.

Most cruelly, U.S. imperialism used napalm bombs to burn women, children, and the elderly to death; those who were not killed were severely burned.

After aerial and artillery bombardment and strafing, U.S. troops would conduct "sweeping" operations, burning and destroying everything left, blowing up people's shelters, burning granaries, raping women, arresting, torturing, and massacring the people. This is the "burn it all, kill it all, destroy it all" policy.

This is a war waged by U.S. imperialism against the entire Vietnamese nation. In South Vietnam, the number of people killed and injured and the number of villages and houses destroyed is countless. However, from the horrifying figures released by the U.S. authorities—638,000 tons of bombs to be dropped in 1966, hundreds of thousands of rockets and countless napalm and incendiary bombs fired each month—one can see the enormity of U.S. imperialism's crimes.

In areas temporarily controlled by the U.S. and puppet forces, they continue to concentrate the people into so-called "new life villages" (previously known as "strategic hamlets"). The scoundrels in Saigon create terror in these villages every day. The U.S. aggressors also bomb and strafe villages seeking liberation.

From 1954 to 1965, the following occurred: 170,000 people were killed; 800,000 were injured or maimed; 400,000 were imprisoned; 5,000,000 were confined to concentration camps.

Currently, the U.S. can only control one-fifth of the land, but it continues to use old tactics.

Since 1961, U.S. aggressors have used methods that even Hitler's fascism dared not use, increasingly conducting chemical warfare on a large scale in South Vietnam. The U.S. goal is clear: when the U.S. and puppet forces can no longer control a certain area, they destroy all crops, starving and impoverishing the people, attempting to force them to surrender.

The area sprayed with chemical poisons increases year by year: 11,000 hectares in 1962; 300,000 hectares in 1963; 500,000 hectares in 1964; 700,000 hectares in 1965. In 1965, after the spraying of chemical poisons, 150,000 people were poisoned to varying degrees.

Another extremely barbaric aspect of chemical warfare is the use of poison gas. Especially since late September last year, Washington has given full authority to the U.S. military command in Saigon to use poison gas. Now, poison gas has become a "standard" equipment for the invading U.S. forces in Vietnam.

Through analysis and newspaper revelations, it is clear that the U.S. has used tear gas, phosgene, and Adam's gas. Tear gas, Adam's gas, and phosgene all have a strong destructive effect on the respiratory and digestive tract membranes.

The U.S. military command also spreads poison in areas it cannot control, contaminating food, salt, and water.

The U.S. has brought all kinds of weapons and chemical poisons invented by modern science and technology to Vietnam for testing.

On August 5, 1964, aircraft from the U.S. Seventh Fleet bombed many locations along the coast of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic. Subsequently, from February 7, 1965, bombing activities almost occurred daily, with the bombing range expanding day by day. The U.S. authorities repeatedly shout: accept peace and the bombing will stop. Under such conditions, what does peace mean if it is not surrender?

U.S. aircraft have attacked various cities, including Hanoi and Haiphong. In addition, countless villages have been burned or leveled.

U.S. aircraft have madly bombed and destroyed hospitals and schools. In North Vietnam, so far, the U.S. Air Force has destroyed 296 schools, 84 hospitals, clinics, and maternity wards, 80 churches, and 30 temples.

U.S. aircraft have also attacked fishing boats, bombed dikes, and water gates.

The U.S. aggressors have sent aircraft to bomb factories, dikes, water gates, schools, and hospitals in the Vietnamese Democratic Republic, aiming to threaten the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people, destroy the construction projects of the Vietnamese people, and obstruct the progress of the Vietnamese people.

U.S. imperialism, waging an aggressive war against a nation that resolutely defends its independence, must use all the most barbaric means to attempt to suppress the people's resistance. However, in reality, it cannot save its political and military failures in South Vietnam, nor can it shake the firm will of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government and the Vietnamese people. On the other hand, the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam has become unprecedentedly strong and well-equipped, achieving brilliant victories; the Vietnamese Democratic Republic has unprecedented military potential, shooting down 1,500 U.S. aggressor aircraft, and achieving victories on the production front.

Any attempt to avoid further deterioration of the situation, under the pretext of not severely punishing and indicting U.S. imperialism's aggressive actions, is paving the way for more dangerous adventurism and allowing these extremely barbaric crimes to continue forever.

The national rights of the Vietnamese people must be respected. In his call to the people on July 17, 1966, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out:

"The United States must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, must withdraw all its troops and mercenaries from Vietnam, and then peace will be immediately restored. The position of Vietnam is clear: this is the four-point proposal of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam. There is no other way!"

"The Vietnamese people love peace very much, love true peace, peace based on independence and freedom, not false peace, American-style 'peace'..."

This is the fundamental principle, without which all normal international life is impossible. Apart from this, there can be no solution.

### 越南调查美帝侵越罪行委员会提出血的控诉  美国侵略者在越南犯下滔天罪行  一切野蛮手段都挽救不了美帝的失败，动摇不了越南人民的战斗意志

    越南调查美帝侵越罪行委员会提出血的控诉
    美国侵略者在越南犯下滔天罪行
    一切野蛮手段都挽救不了美帝的失败，动摇不了越南人民的战斗意志
    美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的　掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。
    据新华社河内十九日电　越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会，十月三十一日公布了一份“美帝国主义在越南的罪行”的材料。这份材料共分四个部分，以大量事实揭露了美帝国主义在侵越战争中残杀无辜人民、进行化学战争等滔天罪行。这份材料的摘要如下：
    一支包括三十三万人，拥有三千四百架各种类型飞机，二千门重炮和数以千计的装甲车的美国远征军，在约五万名南朝鲜、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾和泰国帮凶军的帮助下，正在远离美国本土一万三千公里的越南南方，进行着一场战争。从美国第七舰队、以及越南南方和泰国的各个基地起飞的美国飞机，正在不分日夜地轰炸、扫射越南南北两方。
    这场战争的残酷性是前所未有的，美国侵略者的罪恶满盈的行动只能同希特勒法西斯的罪行相比拟。
    美帝国主义一九六五年在越南投下了二十五万吨炸弹。一九六六年六月份投下了六万一千吨炸弹，七月份投下了九万一千吨炸弹。据美新处报道，麦克纳马拉曾经透露，一九六六年下半年，投在越南的炸弹每月平均数比在第二次世界大战期间，投在欧洲和非洲的炸弹每月平均数还要多。
    美帝国主义除了使用空军进行轰炸外，还用它的第七舰队战舰的大炮，对各个村庄滥施轰击。
    美帝国主义还使用了从关岛基地起飞的B—52型战略轰炸机，滥肆轰炸。据合众国际社报道，截至一九六六年九月十四日止，B—52型飞机出击了五千架次，投下了炸弹约十万吨。
    尤其残酷的是，美帝国主义使用了凝固汽油弹，来烧杀妇女、儿童和老人；没有被杀害的人也被严重烫伤。
    经过空军和炮兵的轰击、扫射之后，美军就前来进行“扫荡”，烧毁、破坏一切残存的东西，炸开人民的掩蔽洞，焚烧粮仓、强奸妇女，逮捕、严刑审讯和屠杀人民。这就是“烧光、杀光、毁光”政策。
    这是美帝国主义进行的一场反对越南整个民族的战争。在越南南方，被打死打伤的人和被烧毁的村庄和房屋，难以数计。但是，仅从美国当局公布的一九六六年将投下六十三万八千吨炸弹，每月发射成百万枚火箭和无数的凝固汽油弹、磷燃烧弹的骇人听闻的数目字里，也足以看得出美帝国主义的罪行之大。
    在美伪军暂时控制地区，他们继续把人民集中到所谓的“新生村”（过去叫“战略村”）里。西贡的恶棍们每天都在这些村庄中制造恐怖事件。美国侵略者还对起来谋求解放的村民进行轰炸和扫射。
    从一九五四年到一九六五年，已经有：十七万人被打死；八十万人被打伤和变成残废；四十万人被监禁在监狱里；五百万人被关在集中营里。
    目前，美国只能控制五分之一的土地，但它仍然继续采用旧的手段。
    从一九六一年以来，美国侵略者在越南南方使用了连希特勒法西斯也不敢使用的手段，日益大规模地进行化学战争。美国的目的很清楚：当美军和伪军再也控制不了某一个地方的时候，他们就毁坏全部庄稼，使人民陷于饥饿贫困，妄图以此来迫使人民向他们屈膝投降。
    撒放化学毒药的面积一年比一年增加：一九六二年是一万一千公顷；一九六三年是三十万公顷；一九六四年是五十万公顷；一九六五年是七十万公顷。一九六五年，在撒放化学毒药以后，有十五万人受到不同程度的中毒。
    化学战争的另一个极其野蛮的方面是使用毒气。特别是从去年九月底起，华盛顿已经把使用毒气的全权授予驻在西贡的美军指挥部了。现在，毒气已经成为侵越美军的一种“常规”装备了。
    通过分析的结果和报纸的透露表明，美国使用了催泪气，丙光气，亚当氏气等种毒气。而像催泪气，亚当氏气，丙光气等毒气，都对呼吸器官和消化器官粘膜具有强烈的毁坏作用。
    美军指挥部还在它不能控制的地区撒放毒药，使食物、食盐和水染毒。
    美国已经把现代科学技术发明出来的所有各种武器和化学毒药拿到越南来进行试验。
    一九六四年八月五日，美国第七舰队的飞机，对越南民主共和国沿海地区的许多地点进行了轰炸。接着，从一九六五年二月七日起，轰炸活动几乎天天在进行，轰炸的范围日益扩大。美国当局不断叫嚷：接受和平就可以停止轰炸。在这种条件下的和平，如果不是屈膝投降的话，还能意味着什么呢？
    美国飞机袭击了各个城市，它们也轰炸了河内和海防。此外，还有无数的村庄被烧毁或炸平。
    美国飞机疯狂地轰炸和破坏医院和学校。在越南北方，到目前为止，美国空军摧毁了二百九十六所学校、八十四个医院、医疗站和助产院，八十个教堂和三十个寺院。
    美国飞机还袭击了渔船，轰炸了堤坝和水闸。
    美国侵略者出动飞机轰炸越南民主共和国的工厂、堤坝、水闸、学校和医院，其阴谋是企图威胁越南人民的斗争精神，破坏越南人民的建筑工程和阻挡越南人民前进的步伐。
    美帝国主义对一个坚决维护自己独立的民族发动了一场侵略战争，必然要使用一切最野蛮的手段来妄图压倒人民的抗战力量。但是，实际上，它仍然挽救不了他们在越南南方的政治和军事失败，动摇不了越南民主共和国政府和越南人民的坚强意志。另一方面，越南南方民族解放阵线空前强大和拥有充分装备，取得了辉煌胜利；越南民主共和国已经拥有空前强大的军事潜力，击落了美国强盗飞机一千五百架，同时在生产战线上取得了胜利。
    任何以避免局势进一步恶化为借口，而不严惩和控诉美帝国主义这一侵略行动，就是为更危险的冒险行动铺平道路，就是让这些极其野蛮的罪行永远继续下去。
    越南人民的民族权利必须得到尊重。胡志明主席在一九六六年七月十七日的号召书中指出：
      “美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。越南的立场是明确的：这就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。此外，没有其他办法！”
      “越南人民十分热爱和平，热爱真正的和平，在独立、自由基础上的和平，而不是假和平、美国式的‘和平’……”。
    这是基本的原则，没有这些原则，一切正常的国际生活都是不可能有的。除此以外，不可能有解决办法。
