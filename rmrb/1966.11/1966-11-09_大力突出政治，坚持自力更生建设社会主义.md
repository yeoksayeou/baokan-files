The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour adopts resolutions on the Fourth Five-Year Plan and amendments to the Party Charter

The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, held from November 5 to 7, discussed the report by Comrade Shehu on the directives for the 1966-1970 Fourth Five-Year Plan for the development of Albania's economy and culture.

Over the course of three days, 29 representatives spoke on Comrade Shehu's report. After thorough discussion, the congress unanimously passed a resolution endorsing Comrade Shehu's report. The resolution calls for all Party organizations and state and economic organs in Albania to use the guidelines and tasks outlined in the report as their criteria in implementing the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

The congress also unanimously adopted the resolution on the directives for the Fourth Five-Year Plan for the development of Albania's economy and culture, and the resolution on amendments to the Party Charter.

During the discussions, Comrade S. Kolega, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, spoke. He said that the Fourth Five-Year Plan was formulated by drawing on the wisdom of the masses and was the result of following the mass line. He stressed that a thorough, merciless, and principled struggle must be waged against revisionist views in economic work. The Party of Labour of Albania will continue to expose the views of modern revisionists who advocate abandoning centralized state leadership of the economy.

Kolega also emphasized the issue of labor remuneration. He said that the primary and decisive factor is spiritual incentive.

Comrade P. Dodbiiba, a member of the Central Committee of the Party and Minister of Agriculture, spoke. He said that the laboring peasants of our country, with great enthusiasm and unshakable confidence, have responded to the Party's call to rely mainly on their own strength to build socialism. He stressed that the task of increasing agricultural production, especially grain production, is of great political and strategic importance. This task is related to further transforming the socialist countryside and to defending the socialist system and the motherland from sudden attacks.

Comrade A. Charçani, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, spoke on the issue of Albania's industrialization. In discussing the great significance of adhering to the principle of self-reliance in socialist construction, he pointed out that self-reliance means regarding internal factors—the political, spiritual, and economic forces of our country—as the primary and decisive factors. On this basis, we should draw on the good experiences of other countries and obtain selfless internationalist aid.

Comrade H. Toska, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, spoke on the issue of fully utilizing domestic resources, mainly relying on our own accumulated funds, and greatly increasing investment in agriculture during the new five-year plan. Toska also stressed that scientific experiments should be directly linked to production. He called on scientific workers to rely more on the valuable and rich experience of workers and peasants. He said that scientific workers should, based on Marxist-Leninist theory and methods, continue to emphasize politics, constantly wage class struggle, raise socialist consciousness, and, through continuously mastering the results of modern scientific and technological research, systematically improve their own knowledge level.

Comrade K. Theodhori, a candidate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Minister of Industry and Mines, spoke. He said that during the Fourth Five-Year Plan, Party organizations at all levels should focus on the issue of tapping internal production potentials. For this purpose, the Party requires workers in industrial and mining departments to further improve their work, display initiative and creativity, carry out further revolutionization of production, and better utilize production capacities and improve labor productivity.

In the past few days, many Party representatives from various regions, government agencies, factories, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives have reported at the congress on the great achievements of the people in various places in smashing the imperialist and revisionist blockade and building socialism through self-reliance during the Third Five-Year Plan. They have also reported on the achievements of Party organizations in various places this year in implementing the Party Central Committee's series of revolutionary measures, emphasizing proletarian politics, following the mass line, and carrying out revolutionary class education. The representatives pledged to resolutely complete the tasks set by this congress, to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to persist in the path of building socialism through self-reliance.

On the 6th, the congress unanimously adopted a resolution in support of the Indonesian Communist Party and patriots, amidst enthusiastic applause. The resolution states that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, representing all Party members and the people of Albania, strongly condemns the reactionary forces in Indonesia, who have been backed by U.S. imperialism and supported by the Khrushchev revisionists, for carrying out a counter-revolutionary white terror against the Communist Party, progressive forces, and the people of Indonesia for over a year.

The resolution demands that the Indonesian fascist criminals stop their actions immediately, release the imprisoned communists and patriots, and guarantee the democratic rights and freedoms of them and all the people of Indonesia.

The resolution states that the Party of Labour of Albania and the people stand firmly with the Indonesian Communist Party and progressive forces. It expresses the belief that, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people will overcome temporary difficulties and achieve victory over the fascist counter-revolution through revolutionary struggle.

Over the course of three days, delegations from the Communist Party of Peru, the Communist Party of Bolivia, the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile, the Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement of France, the Marxist-Leninist Organization of Austria, and the Labor Party of Haiti, among others, delivered congratulatory speeches at the congress.

The representative of the delegation from the Communist Party of Peru delivered a congratulatory speech, saying that the Communist Party of Peru is holding high the unbreakable banner of people's war, preparing for armed struggle, and considering this the only way to liberation from the rule of U.S. imperialism and the local reactionaries.

He said that the Communist Party of Peru believes that without opposing modern revisionism, it is impossible to consistently oppose imperialism. The Communist Party of Peru will continue to condemn the split activities of the Khrushchev revisionists and their lackeys in Latin America. We reject the calls for "united action," which we see as a trick to lead the wavering to betrayal. We oppose the so-called "middle position" and believe that "neutralism" is just a slippery slope to the revisionist swamp.

He said that the Communist Party of Peru firmly condemns the anti-China movement. We believe that the People's Republic of China is an unshakable bastion of the world revolution, and the glorious Communist Party of China is a tested Marxist-Leninist party that, under the brilliant guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, creatively develops Marxism-Leninism.

The head of the delegation from the Communist Party of Bolivia, Oscar Samora, delivered a congratulatory speech, saying that the Party of Labour of Albania, together with the great Communist Party of China, is firmly holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and resolutely opposing the activities of the Khrushchev revisionists.

He said that it is time for Marxist-Leninists to draw a clear line with modern revisionists. If not, they will quickly join the chorus of revisionists and sing love songs to the imperialists, betraying their own people and the international communist movement.

The head of the delegation from the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile, Jorge Dias, in his congratulatory speech, praised the historic contributions of the Albanian people, under the leadership of the great leader Enver Hoxha and the Marxist-Leninist Party, in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

He said that currently, imperialism and revisionism are colluding with each other in their desperate struggles, fiercely attacking Marxist-Leninists. Marxist-Leninists around the world should form a revolutionary grand alliance against imperialism and revisionism to counter the anti-China holy alliance. He said that today, Latin America is like a powder keg ready to explode. The fuse should be lit by the new type of Marxist-Leninist parties, which will lead the oppressed and exploited masses to seize power through the only way—armed struggle.

The head of the delegation from the Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement of France, Ray Casas, first read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement of France at the meeting. The letter warmly congratulates the Party of Labour of Albania and the people on their achievements in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

In his speech, he introduced the situation of the first congress of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement of France. He said that the delegates present came from various regions in France where revisionism has been condemned and is failing. They yearn for communist ideology and the red sun of the great Chinese revolution rising in the East. He said that inspired by the example of the great Chinese people, we pay tribute here to the great Marxist-Leninist, the contemporary Lenin—Mao Zedong.

The head of the delegation from the Labor Party of Haiti, Jules Lero, said in his speech that heroic Albania is a symbol of revolutionary steadfastness and courage. The Party of Labour of Albania is a shining example of loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and a resolute defender and implementer of Marxism-Leninism.

He said that at the first congress of the Labor Party of Haiti held three months ago, it was pointed out that Haitian revolutionaries should arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism and its further development in the contemporary era—Mao Zedong Thought. They should unite the working class, go deep into the laboring masses, and educate and organize the masses with the spirit that a people's war must be waged.

The head of the delegation from the Marxist-Leninist Organization of Austria, Franz Strober, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress, saying that the more the Khrushchev revisionists launch frenzied attacks on the Party of Labour of Albania, the more it increases our respect, trust, and love for our strong comrades and the people who are truly sons of the eagle.

He said that we Austrian Marxist-Leninists, holding high the red flag of the proletariat that has been defiled by revisionism, the fighting and invincible flag, have established our revolutionary organization—the Marxist-Leninist Organization of Austria. We pledge to you and to comrades in other countries that, no matter how arduous and long our path may be, we will continue to march forward bravely and unyieldingly.

The congress also read out the congratulatory letter from the Communist Party of Thailand and the congratulatory telegram from the Communist Party of India.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand said in its congratulatory letter that the Party of Labour of Albania has resolutely opposed modern revisionists and the traitor Tito clique, making great contributions to consolidating and developing the international communist movement.

The letter pointed out that the people of Thailand, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, have taken up arms and are fighting against the enemy. The national democratic revolution of Thailand can only be completed through the path of armed struggle. The letter expressed that the Communist Party of Thailand will fight to the end with Soviet revisionists.

The congress also received congratulatory telegrams or letters from the Swiss Communist Organization and Marxist-Leninists from Spain, West Germany, Finland, Scotland, and other countries.

    科列加还着重谈到了有关劳动报酬的问题。他说，关于精神鼓励和物质奖励的关系，主要的和决定性的还是精神鼓励。
    劳动党中央委员、农业部长皮·多德比巴发言说，我国劳动农民满怀热情和不可动摇的信心，响应党关于首先依靠自己的力量来建设社会主义的号召。他强调指出，完成增加农业生产，尤其是粮食生产的任务有极其重要的政治和战略意义。这个任务是同进一步改造社会主义的农村，以及保卫社会主义制度和祖国免遭突然袭击有关的。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席阿·查尔查尼在发言中着重谈到了阿尔巴尼亚工业化的问题。他在谈到在社会主义建设中贯彻自力更生原则的重大意义时指出，自力更生，就是要把内部因素——我国的政治、精神和经济力量，看做是主要的、决定性的因素。在这个政策的基础上，吸取其他国家的好经验，取得无私的国际主义的援助。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席哈·托斯卡在发言中谈到了在新五年计划期间全面利用国内资源，主要依靠自己积累资金，以及大力增加农业投资等问题。托斯卡还强调，科学实验应同生产直接联系起来。他要求科学工作者更多地依靠工人和农民的宝贵的丰富经验。他指出，科学工作者要根据马克思列宁主义的理论和方法，继续大力突出政治，不断开展阶级斗争，提高社会主义觉悟，并通过不断地掌握现代的科学技术研究成果，有系统地提高自己的知识水平。
    劳动党中央政治局候补委员、工业和矿产部长科·蒂奥多西在发言中说，在第四个五年计划期间，各级党组织应该把挖掘内部生产潜力的问题作为注意的中心。为此，党要求工矿部门的劳动者要进一步改进工作，发扬主动精神和创造性，实行生产的进一步革命化，并更好地利用生产能力和提高劳动生产率。
    这几天来，许多来自各地区党政机关、工厂企业和农业合作社的党代表，在大会上的发言中，报告了各地劳动人民在第三个五年计划期间粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的封锁，自力更生地建设社会主义的巨大成就；汇报了今年以来各地党组织在贯彻党中央的一系列革命化措施，在突出无产阶级政治、贯彻群众路线、进行革命的阶级教育等方面的成就。代表们保证，要坚决完成这次代表大会规定的任务，要加强无产阶级专政，坚持自力更生建设社会主义的道路。
    在六日的大会上，全体代表在热烈的掌声中，一致通过一项声援印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国者的决议。决议表示，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党全体党员和全国人民，坚决谴责受美帝国主义扶植和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者支持的印尼反动派一年多来对印尼的共产党人、进步力量和全国人民所进行的反革命白色恐怖。
    决议坚决要求印尼法西斯罪犯们住手，立即释放被监禁的共产党人和爱国者，保证他们和全体印尼人民的民主权利和自由。
    决议说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民完全站在印尼共产党人和进步力量的一边，并且相信，印尼人民在印尼共产党的领导下，必将克服暂时的困难，通过革命斗争，取得对法西斯反革命的胜利。
    三天来，在大会上致贺词的有秘鲁共产党、玻利维亚共产党、智利革命共产党、法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）、奥地利马克思列宁主义者组织和海地劳动党等代表团。
    秘鲁共产党代表团代表致贺词说，秘鲁共产党高举人民战争的坚不可摧的旗帜，准备进行武装斗争，并把这看作是从美帝国主义和本国反动派的统治下争取解放的唯一道路。
    他说，秘鲁共产党人认为，不反对现代修正主义，就不能始终不渝地反对帝国主义。秘鲁共产党人将不断地谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其在拉丁美洲的走狗的分裂活动。我们驳斥“联合行动”的叫嚷，并认为这是企图使不坚定分子走向背叛的骗局。我们反对所谓“中间立场”，并认为“中立主义”只不过是导向修正主义泥坑的下坡路。
    他说，秘鲁共产党人坚决谴责反华运动。我们认为，中华人民共和国是世界革命的坚不可摧的根据地，光荣的中国共产党是久经考验的马克思列宁主义的党，是在毛泽东同志的光辉思想照耀下创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的推动力量。
    玻利维亚共产党代表团团长奥斯卡·萨莫拉致贺词说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党同伟大的中国共产党一起高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，坚定地反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的活动。
    他说，现在是马克思列宁主义者和现代修正主义者划清界限的时候了，如果不这样，那就会很快加入修正主义者的合唱队，对帝国主义者唱起情歌；背叛本国人民和国际共产主义运动。
    智利革命共产党代表团团长霍尔赫·迪亚斯在贺词中赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民在以伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查为首的马克思列宁主义党的领导下，在反对帝国主义和反对修正主义的斗争中的历史性贡献。
    他说，当前帝国主义和修正主义在互相勾结起来，进行垂死挣扎，疯狂地打击马克思列宁主义者。全世界马克思列宁主义者应当以反对帝国主义和反对修正主义的革命大联盟，来同反华的神圣同盟相对抗。他说，今天，拉丁美洲像将要爆炸的火药桶，点燃导火线的应该是新型的马克思列宁主义政党，它们将领导被压迫和被剥削的群众，通过唯一的道路——武装斗争来夺取政权。

    海地劳动党代表团团长儒·列鲁在贺词中说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚是革命坚定性和勇敢的象征，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是忠实于马克思列宁主义、坚决捍卫和贯彻马克思列宁主义的光辉典范。
    他说，在三个月前召开的海地劳动党第一次代表大会指出，海地革命者应该用马克思列宁主义及其在当代的进一步发展——毛泽东思想武装起来，团结工人阶级，深入劳动群众，以必须进行人民战争的精神来教育和组织群众。
    奥地利马克思列宁主义者组织代表团团长弗·施特罗伯尔向代表大会致贺词说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者愈是对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党进行疯狂的攻击，就愈增加我们奥地利马克思列宁主义者对坚强的同志，对不愧称为山鹰之子的人民的尊敬、信任和热爱。
    他说，我们奥地利马克思列宁主义者高举被修正主义玷污了的、战斗的、不可战胜的无产阶级的红旗，成立了我们的革命组织——奥地利马克思列宁主义者组织。我们向你们和其他国家的战友保证，不管我们的道路多么艰巨、多么漫长，我们都要英勇不屈地沿着这条道路继续走下去。
