Title: A Barrel of Manure for Whom?

Last year, I accumulated a barrel of manure, intending to use it for my own melon patch. I gathered ten carts of fine fertilizer, keeping one cart aside, also planning to use it in my melon field. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao said: "Our entire army, with all its units and men, is a united fighting force. We have a common ideal, a common will, and a common struggle. We are all revolutionaries." I repeatedly thought about Chairman Mao's words and the spirit of Zhang Zide, who was "completely" and "thoroughly" dedicated to the revolution. I felt very ashamed. I was always focused on myself, just like someone said: "Standing on the Sixiang Mountain, you can see the edge of the sky; standing on the stove, you can only see the bottom of the pot." I told myself: "Wang Youfu, you only care about yourself and not the collective. This is selfishness! Can you do this to Chairman Mao?" Knowing my mistake, I immediately donated all the manure and fine fertilizer to the collective, feeling particularly happy. From this incident, I realized that I had overestimated myself in the past, thinking that an old poor peasant did not need to change his thoughts. Now I see that this idea is wrong. New things appear every day, and people's thoughts also change constantly. Whoever does not use Chairman Mao's teachings to change their thoughts will not be able to do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Without changing one's thoughts, one cannot be revolutionary in the second half of life. The older the poor peasant, the more revolutionary he should be, and the more he should listen to Chairman Mao's words and change his thoughts.

### 一缸茅粪让谁用

    一缸茅粪让谁用
    山西阳高县张连庄大队社员　王有富
    去年，我积了一缸茅粪，准备自己留着奶窝瓜。拾了十车精肥，留下一车，也准备往窝瓜地里上。学了《为人民服务》，毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我反复想着毛主席的话，想到张思德同志“完全”、“彻底”为革命的精神，感到很惭愧。我步步不离自己，正像有人说的：“站在六梭山，看到天边边；站在锅台上，看到锅底下。”我对自己说：“王有富呀王有富，你不管集体，光为自己，这是自私自利呀！这样做你对得起毛主席吗？”知错就改。我立即把留下的茅粪和精肥全部投给集体，心里特别痛快。从这件事情，我感到过去对自己估计过高，觉得老贫农不需要改造思想。现在看来这种想法是错误的。新事物天天出现，人的思想也会不断变化。谁要是不好好用毛主席的教导改造思想，就不可能宗宗事情都照毛主席的指示去办。不改造思想，后半辈子就不能革命。越是老贫农越要革命，越要听毛主席的话，好好改造思想。
