More than a hundred revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards from Jia County, a revolutionary old base area in northern Shaanxi, came to Beijing on November 11th. They brought with them a radiant banner and went to Tiananmen Square to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao. The banner, with its prominent golden characters, was a calligraphy by Chairman Mao from 1947:

	"Stand on the side of the overwhelming majority of the laboring people."

The young rebels who grew up in the cradle of revolution said: Chairman Mao's calligraphy for the people of Jia County in the past fully demonstrates the great heart of the greatest proletarian revolutionary, who breathes with the people and shares their fate. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and forever, forever stand on the side of the overwhelming majority of the laboring people!

    佳县小将的决心
    陕北革命老根据地佳县来京的一百多名革命师生和红卫兵，十一月十一日，带着一面光彩夺目的锦旗，来到天安门广场，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。锦旗上醒目的金色大字，是毛主席一九四七年的亲笔题词：
      “站在最大多数劳动人民的一面”。
    在革命摇篮里成长起来的小将们说：毛主席当年为佳县人民的题词，充分表现了最伟大的无产阶级革命家和人民群众同呼吸、共命运的胸怀。我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，永远永远地站在最大多数劳动人民的一面！
