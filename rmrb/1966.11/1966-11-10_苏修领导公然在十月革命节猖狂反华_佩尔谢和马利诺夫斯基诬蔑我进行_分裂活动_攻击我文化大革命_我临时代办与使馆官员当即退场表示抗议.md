MOSCOW, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) — The Soviet revisionist leadership group recently brazenly attacked China at a celebration of the anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and during a military parade on Red Square, launching a fierce assault on Chinese leaders and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

According to reports, at the celebration of the October Revolution held on November 6 in the Kremlin, Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Politburo member Pervukhin delivered a speech in which he repeatedly attacked China and Chinese leaders by name. Pervukhin expressed "regret" that Chinese leaders had refused the so-called "joint action to aid Vietnam" vigorously advocated by the Soviet revisionist leadership group. He pulled out old, discredited clichés from the Soviet revisionist leadership group's anti-China propaganda arsenal, accusing Chinese leaders of "intensifying splitist activities in the international communist movement," claiming that "such activities have greatly aided our common enemy—imperialism and world reactionaries." He even had the audacity to demand that Chinese leaders take "serious responsibility" for these activities. To incite anti-China sentiment among the Soviet people, Pervukhin distorted the facts, portraying the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's opposition to the betrayal and treachery of the Soviet revisionist leadership group as "anti-Soviet." He used this as an excuse to attack the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, claiming that the plenum's documents "further advanced China's slanderous anti-Soviet campaign." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China also became a thorn in Pervukhin's side. He gnashed his teeth and cursed, "Now, everything being done in the name of 'cultural revolution' in China has nothing to do with revolution, culture, Marxism, or socialist policies."

On the morning of November 7, during the parade and march on Red Square, Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky delivered a speech to the Soviet armed forces, the Soviet people, and foreign guests, also attacking Chinese leaders for opposing the Soviet leadership's so-called "joint action to aid Vietnam." Over the past year or so, the Soviet leadership group has been advocating this "joint action," which in reality is aimed at aligning with its big deal with U.S. imperialism to have socialist countries join in selling out the Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. aggression. However, Malinovsky lied, claiming that Chinese leaders' opposition to this "joint action" was "hindering the unity of progressive forces in the anti-U.S. struggle in Vietnam" and was "encouraging" new U.S. "aggressive crimes."

In response to the Soviet leaders' arrogant anti-China ranting, Zhang Dequn, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union, and other embassy officials who were invited to attend the celebration in the Kremlin and the parade on Red Square immediately left the venue in protest after being named in the attacks.

Among the small clique of anti-China forces internationally, the Soviet leadership group has always played the leading role. In recent times, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has flourished, their anti-China rhetoric has become even more frenzied. Chairman Mao said, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The more the Soviet revisionist leadership group fervently attacks China, the more it proves the glory, correctness, and greatness of the Chinese Communist Party, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and the more it shows that the days of the Soviet revisionist leadership group are numbered. A Russian proverb says, "Whoever throws mud at the sun will have the mud fall on their own head." The Soviet leadership group's brazen use of the celebration of the October Revolution to launch a frenzied attack on China can only further expose themselves, causing no harm to the great Chinese people.

    苏修领导公然在十月革命节猖狂反华

    新华社九日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联修正主义领导集团最近公然在庆祝十月社会主义革命节的大会上和在红场上举行阅兵游行时，大放反华厥词，猖狂地攻击中国领导人和中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    据报道，十一月六日在莫斯科克里姆林宫举行的十月革命节庆祝大会上，苏共中央政治局委员佩尔谢作报告时多次公开指名攻击中国和中国领导人。佩尔谢对中国领导人拒绝苏联修正主义领导集团起劲叫嚷的所谓社会主义国家“援越联合行动”表示“遗憾”。他从苏联修正主义领导集团反华宣传武库中搬出早已破产的滥调，诬蔑中国领导人“在国际共产主义运动中加紧分裂活动”，说什么“这种行动给共同的敌人——帝国主义和世界反动派帮了大忙”，他还煞有介事地要中国领导人承担“这种行动的严重责任”。为了在苏联人民中煽动反华情绪，佩尔谢不惜歪曲事实，把中国共产党和中国人民反对苏联修正主义领导集团的叛徒和工贼行为说成什么“反苏”。他为此攻击中共八届十一中全会，说什么全会的文件“更加推进了中国的诽谤性反苏运动”。中国目前正在展开的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命也成了佩尔谢的眼中钉。他咬牙切齿地咒骂说，“现在中国在所谓‘文化革命’的旗号下做的一切，都同革命和文化，同马克思主义，同社会主义政策毫无共同之处”。
    七日上午，在红场举行节日阅兵和游行时，苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基向苏联武装部队、苏联人民和外宾发表演说，也就中国反对苏联领导人的所谓“援越联合行动”攻击了中国领导人。最近一年多来，苏联领导集团高唱这种“联合行动”，实质上是为了适应它同美帝国主义的大交易而要社会主义国家同它一起“联合”出卖正在进行抗美斗争的越南人民，然而，马利诺夫斯基却胡说什么，中国领导人反对这种“联合行动”是“妨碍了世界进步力量在反美侵越中的团结”，是“鼓励了”美国“新的侵略罪行”。
    面对苏联领导人这种狂妄的反华叫嚣，应邀出席克里姆林宫庆祝大会和红场阅兵游行的中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办张德群和大使馆其他官员，都在他们指名反华后立即退场，以示抗议。
    在国际上一小撮反华势力中，苏联领导集团一向是充当头号角色的。最近时期，随着中国无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃发展，他们的反华叫嚷更加疯狂起来。毛主席说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。苏联修正主义领导集团越是起劲地反华，就越是证明高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国共产党的光荣、正确和伟大，就更加表明苏联修正主义领导集团的日子越来越不好过。俄罗斯谚语说得好，“谁向太阳扔污泥，污泥就会落在谁的头上”，苏联领导集团公然利用庆祝十月革命节的场合猖狂反华，这只能进一步暴露他们自己，丝毫无损于伟大的中国人民。
