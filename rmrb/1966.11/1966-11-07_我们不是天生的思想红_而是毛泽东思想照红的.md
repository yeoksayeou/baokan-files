Workers in the cleaning brigade led by Shi Zhanxiang told the young revolutionaries of the "Long March Red Guards":

"We are not born with red thoughts, but rather our thoughts are made red by Mao Zedong Thought."

The revolutionary young people of the "Long March Red Guards" from Dalian Maritime Academy, who walked over 2,000 miles to Beijing to connect with the revolution, recently studied the "Three Articles" together with the famous labor model Shi Zhanxiang and other sanitation workers while cleaning latrines. They received a profound education.

Early in the morning, as the sun began to rise, the young revolutionaries of the "Long March Red Guards" arrived at the work area of Shi Zhanxiang and his cleaning brigade. Shi Zhanxiang saw that the young people were full of spirit and eager to participate in labor, and he was very happy. He excitedly told the young people, "On your journey, you have overcome mountains and rivers, spreading Mao Zedong Thought wherever you go. You truly are Chairman Mao's good students. We welcome you to join us in cleaning latrines. Today's labor is not ordinary labor; it is a 'demonstration' by the revolutionary youth and the working class against the old world. We workers will always be the strong backbone of the Red Guards. We are willing to work together with the Red Guards to use our iron shovels to clean out all the filth and mud, the roots of revisionism, and build a bright red new world!"

During the joint labor, the meticulous and responsible work attitude of the sanitation workers deeply educated the young revolutionaries. At the beginning of the latrine cleaning, the "Long March Red Guards" would finish their work and leave, but the workers would stay behind to clean up any spilled waste. Sometimes, if they encountered a broken latrine, they would help fix it before leaving. The workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, fully and thoroughly served the people, which deeply impressed the revolutionary young people.

In another place, Shi Zhanxiang led a few Red Guards to clean latrines. As they approached the latrine, Shi Zhanxiang led them to take a detour instead of the direct path. The young people were puzzled, wondering why they didn't take the shortcut. Shi Zhanxiang smiled and pointed to the nearby clothesline, saying, "There are people's clothes hanging there. If we're not careful, we might splash waste water on them. Walking a few extra steps is nothing; we shouldn't cause trouble for others." The young people were deeply moved, recognizing this as the spirit of Norman Bethune, whom Chairman Mao praised for his "extreme responsibility to work and extreme dedication to comrades and the people."

One Red Guard, while working, broke his shovel. He hesitated, not wanting to touch the dirty shovel but also not wanting to delay the work by fetching a new one. Just as he was in a dilemma, Shi Zhanxiang took the shovel with his rough, black hands and started repairing it. The Red Guard watched, truly feeling that although the sanitation workers' hands might be dirty, their souls were the cleanest and most noble. He realized that he, who appeared clean on the outside, still had many impure thoughts inside. To become a new person in communism, he must listen to Chairman Mao's words, humbly learn from the workers and peasants, and forever be the sons and good students of the working people.

Where did Shi Zhanxiang and the workers get their red thoughts? The workers replied, "We are not born with red thoughts; rather, our thoughts are made red by Mao Zedong Thought." During a break, a young worker from a poor family shared his process of ideological transformation with the young people. He said that when he first joined the cleaning brigade, he looked down on the work. When he went out to clean latrines, he always wore his mask high and pulled his hat down, fearing that acquaintances might recognize him. Later, Shi Zhanxiang organized everyone to study the "Three Articles" and continuously engage in the struggle to eliminate private interests and establish public interests. He then realized that cleaning latrines was also part of revolutionary work. To do revolution, one must be like Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune, fully and wholeheartedly dedicated, without picking and choosing.

After the labor, Shi Zhanxiang talked with the young people about his miserable youth. He encouraged them to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works actively. He said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Chairman Mao's works express the thoughts of workers and speak of great revolutionary principles. Not reading Chairman Mao's books is forgetting our roots!"

The conversation between Shi Zhanxiang and the workers with the participating Red Guards greatly educated the young revolutionaries. They said that Shi Zhanxiang and his cleaning brigade could become an advanced collective mainly because they loved the Party, loved Chairman Mao, and seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. They actively applied the "Three Articles," learning deeply and using them well, establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. The young people expressed their determination to learn from Shi Zhanxiang and the workers, to repeatedly study the "Three Articles," and to use the "Three Articles" to clean out the filth and mud from the depths of their souls, transforming themselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Finally, Shi Zhanxiang, on behalf of the cleaning brigade, presented the "Long March Red Guards" with a set of the four-volume "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao, encouraging them to forever "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

### 我们不是天生的思想红  而是毛泽东思想照红的

    时传祥所在的清洁队工人对“长征红卫队”小将说：
    我们不是天生的思想红  而是毛泽东思想照红的
    步行二千多里来北京进行革命串连的大连海运学院“长征红卫队”的革命小将们，最近结合学习“老三篇”，同著名劳动模范时传祥等清洁工人一起掏粪，受到了一次深刻的教育。
    早晨，太阳刚刚升起，“长征红卫队”的革命小将们就来到了时传祥和他的清洁队工作的地段。时传祥看到小将们个个精神抖擞，积极要求参加劳动，非常高兴。他激动地对小将们说：“你们一路上逢山过山逢水涉水，走到那里把毛泽东思想宣传到那里，真不愧是毛主席的好学生。你们来和我们一起掏粪，我们非常欢迎。今天的劳动不是普通的劳动，这是我们国家的革命青少年和工人阶级向旧世界宣战的一次“示威”，我们工人永远作红卫兵的坚强后盾。我们愿意同红卫兵一起用我们的铁勺子，把社会上的一切污泥浊水、修正主义根子掏个干净，建设起一个红彤彤的新世界！”
    在共同劳动中，清洁工人们一丝不苟、认真负责的劳动态度，使小将们深受教育。刚开始掏粪的时候，“长征红卫队”的小将们，掏完了就走，可是工人们还继续留下来，把洒在坑边的粪便打扫干净；有时遇到粪坑坏了，就动手帮助修好才走。工人们遵循毛主席的教导，完全、彻底地为人民服务的精神，深深地印在革命小将们的脑子里。
    在另一处地方，时传祥领着几个红卫兵去掏粪，眼看前面不远就是厕所了，可是时传祥却带他们绕了一个弯才走过去。小将们很不理解，为什么放着近路不走走远路呢？时传祥含笑指着前面的晒衣场说：“那里有别人晒的白衣服，不小心就会把粪水溅到衣服上。我们多走几步路，算不了什么，不要给别人增加麻烦。”小将们听了非常感动，这不正是毛主席所称赞的“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的白求恩精神吗？
    有一个红卫兵劳动时用力过猛，把粪勺弄坏了，他想伸手去修吧，感到太脏；去取一个新的吧，又怕耽误工作。正当他进退两难的时候，时传祥伸出他那双粗黑的大手，接过粪勺，就动手修了起来。这位红卫兵看在眼里，真正感到清洁工人的手虽然有时是脏的，他们的灵魂却最干净、最高尚。自己表面上看来干净，实际脑子里还有不少脏思想，要想成为共产主义的新人，就必须听毛主席的话，恭恭敬敬地向工农学习，永远做劳动人民的儿子，做劳动人民的好学生。
    时传祥和工人同志们的这些鲜红的思想是从哪里来的呢？工人们回答说：“我们不是天生的思想红，而是毛泽东思想照红的。”休息的时候，一位贫苦家庭出身的青年工人向小将们介绍了自己思想改造的过程。他说他刚到清洁队的时候，瞧不起这行工作，上街掏粪时，总是把口罩尽量往上戴，把帽子往下拉，生怕被熟人认出来。后来，时传祥组织大家学习“老三篇”，不断进行破私立公的思想斗争，他才认识到掏粪也是革命工作的一部分，干革命就得像张思德、白求恩那样，全心全意地干，不能挑肥拣瘦。
    劳动后，时传祥又和小将们谈起自己悲惨的青少年时代。他鼓励小将们响应林彪同志的号召，活学活用毛主席著作，他说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛主席的著作说出了我们工人的心里话，讲的都是干革命的大道理，不读毛主席的书就是忘本呵！”
    时传祥等工人同志对参加劳动的红卫兵们的谈话，使革命小将们受到很大教育。他们说，时传祥和他所在的清洁队之所以能够成为先进的集体，主要是由于他们热爱党，热爱毛主席，认真学习毛主席著作，活学活用“老三篇”，学得深，用得好，树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想。小将们表示，一定要像时传祥等工人同志那样，反复学习“老三篇”，用“老三篇”把自己灵魂深处的污泥浊水荡涤干净，把自己变为坚定的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    最后，时传祥代表清洁队把《毛泽东选集》四卷宝书和一幅彩色毛主席像送给“长征红卫队”的十五名战士，勉励他们永远“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”（据新华社讯）（附图片）
