The editorial of this newspaper

The President of Guinea, Sekou Toure, in a mass rally in Conakry, strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Guinea and Africa, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is the people's sworn enemy. President Toure forcefully refuted the blackmail by the United States through reduced economic "aid" and solemnly declared the expulsion of the U.S. "Peace Corps" and Americans who adopt a provocative attitude towards Guinea. He also prohibited Pan American Airlines from using the Conakry airport. President Toure's speech and the measures he announced against U.S. aggression are well said and well done! This fully expresses the Guinean people's unyielding will and determination to defend their national independence and dignity. The Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration and firm support for the government and people of Guinea.

Recently, U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the coup regime in Ghana, illegally abducted the Guinean delegation, making a shameless provocation against the Guinean people. This provocation failed. However, U.S. imperialism is not content and still attempts to use reduced economic "aid" and other means to pressure Guinea. Guinea's firm stance not only gave the arrogant U.S. imperialism a resounding slap in the face but also dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism's aggression plans against Guinea, defending and consolidating Guinea's national independence.

As Chairman Mao pointed out in 1949, the essence of U.S. "aid" is: "It can be given, but with conditions. What conditions? To follow me." The so-called economic "aid" from the United States has always been a means for U.S. imperialism to invade and enslave the recipient countries. President Toure told the U.S. government, "Take back your money. What we need is our freedom and dignity." This is a powerful exposure of the U.S.'s so-called "aid."

Chairman Mao also pointed out, "Compared to other imperialist countries, U.S. imperialism, over a long period, has paid more attention to spiritual invasion, from religious affairs to 'charity' and cultural affairs." The U.S. "Peace Corps" is a new tool of aggression designed by U.S. imperialism in the face of the wave of national liberation movements sweeping through Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Guinea's expulsion of the U.S. "Peace Corps" removed a major threat to Guinea's national independence, a very wise measure that will greatly consolidate Guinea's independence and security.

We firmly believe that, relying on their own strength and with the support of revolutionary people around the world, the Guinean people will overcome all difficulties and achieve greater victories in the struggle against imperialism, in defending national independence, and in supporting the African national liberation movement.

    给美帝一记响亮的耳光
    本报评论员
    几内亚塞古·杜尔总统在科纳克里群众大会上强烈谴责美帝国主义对几内亚和非洲的侵略政策，指出美帝国主义是人民的不共戴天的敌人。杜尔总统有力地反击了美国用减少经济“援助”进行的讹诈，并且严正宣布驱逐美国“和平队”和对几内亚采取挑衅态度的美国人，禁止泛美航空公司使用科纳克里机场。杜尔总统的讲话和他所宣布的反对美帝侵略的措施，说得好，做得对！这充分表达了几内亚人民不畏强暴、维护民族独立和尊严的坚定意志和决心。中国人民对几内亚政府和人民表示衷心的钦佩和坚决的支持。
    美帝国主义最近勾结加纳政变当局，非法绑架几内亚代表团，向几内亚人民进行无耻的挑衅。这个挑衅失败了。但是，美帝国主义并不甘心，仍然企图用减少经济“援助”等手段来对几内亚施加压力。几内亚采取的严正立场，不仅给了狂妄的美帝国主义一记响亮的耳光，而且沉重地打击了美帝国主义对几内亚的侵略阴谋，维护和巩固了几内亚的民族独立。
    正如毛主席在一九四九年指出的，美国“援助”的实质是：“送是可以的，要有条件。什么条件呢？就是跟我走。”美国的所谓经济“援助”，从来就是美帝国主义侵略和奴役受“援”国的一种手段。杜尔总统对美国政府说，“收起你们的金钱吧，我们所需要的只是我们的自由和尊严。”这是对美国的所谓“援助”的有力的揭露。
    毛主席还曾经指出，“美帝国主义比较其他帝国主义国家，在很长的时期内，更加注重精神侵略方面的活动，由宗教事业而推广到‘慈善’事业和文化事业。”美国的“和平队”，就是美帝国主义在民族解放运动席卷亚、非、拉的情况下，设计出来的一个新的侵略工具。几内亚驱逐美国“和平队”，拔除了威胁几内亚民族独立的一个心腹大患，是一个十分英明的措施，必将大大巩固几内亚的独立和安全。
    我们坚决相信，几内亚人民依靠自己的力量，在全世界革命人民的支援下，必将战胜一切困难，在反对帝国主义、维护民族独立、支持非洲民族解放运动的斗争中取得更大的胜利。
