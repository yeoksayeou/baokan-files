This army is powerful because all those who are part of it possess a conscious discipline; they are not fighting for the private interests of a few or for the narrow interests of a clique, but are united and fighting for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the entire nation. To stand firmly with the Chinese people and to serve them wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army.

    毛主席语录
    这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。
                                            《论联合政府》
