		Dedication to the Public Requires Meticulous Attention to Detail
		Class Leader Li Genquan of a Certain Unit of the PLA

		Chairman Mao teaches us: We must be extremely responsible in our work; serving the people must be "complete" and "thorough." To achieve this, we must have a meticulous spirit. This is also an important measure of whether a revolutionary truly dedicates themselves to the public.

		Once, I and a few comrades from our class chopped over 800 pounds of horse feed, and we found a few notches on the blade. I thought that perhaps we had chopped some hard object into the feed, so I asked the comrades to quickly find it. Some comrades said, "It might not be something hard; it could be that we chopped some bean cakes yesterday and damaged the blade." I thought that we couldn't just conclude like this. If there was something hard in the feed, the horses might get sick, and it might even cause an accident. Thinking of this, I knelt down and searched through the feed for a while. Sure enough, I found two pieces of iron wire. I showed the iron wire to the comrades and said, "Look, it's iron wire. If the horses eat it, it could puncture their stomachs and intestines. This is something we can't be careless about!" So, we several comrades didn't even eat lunch and searched through the over 800 pounds of feed, finding a total of eighteen pieces of iron wire. I thought: The iron wire used to bundle our feed is generally thick. This means that one bundle of feed had a piece of iron wire in it. The ends of the iron wire should be old and worn. So, I checked each of the eighteen pieces of iron wire again, and both ends were indeed old and worn. The comrades happily said, "This time we've really found them all."

		But had we really found them all? I still wasn't at ease. The iron wire used to bundle the feed is generally the same length. So, I lined up the eighteen pieces of iron wire by their ends and compared them to a whole piece of wire. It was exactly one piece short. To find a piece of iron wire over an inch long in over 800 pounds of feed is truly not an easy task! Some comrades suggested that we could just screen the feed carefully when feeding the horses and pay attention. I thought that pushing the work back because of laziness is an irresponsible attitude. In work, we must be careful not to think that a small problem is nothing to worry about. I and the comrades realized this, so we searched again and again, finally finding the over-inch-long piece of iron wire in the over 800 pounds of feed.

		Through this incident, the comrades and I deeply felt that in work, at critical moments, this meticulous spirit is very important. Without this spirit, being "extremely responsible" in work and serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly" is just empty talk. We must truly learn this spirit from studying the "Three Articles."

    一心为公就要一丝不苟
    解放军某部班长　李根全
    毛主席教导我们：对工作要极端负责；为人民服务要“完全”“彻底”。要做到这些，就要有一丝不苟的精神。这也是衡量一个革命者是否一心为公的重要尺子。
    一次，我同班里几个同志一气铡完了八百多斤马草，发现刀刃上有几个缺口。我想，可能是把什么硬东西铡到草里去了，就叫同志们赶快找。有的同志说：“不一定是铡了什么硬东西，可能是昨天铡豆饼把刀刃磕坏的吧？”我想，这可不能轻易下结论，要是草里存留什么硬东西，马吃了会影响健康，说不定还会出事故。想到这里，我就先蹲下来在草里找了一阵，果然找出了两节铁丝。我拿着铁丝对同志们说：“看，是铁丝，马吃到肚子里，就可能扎破胃肠。这可半点马虎不得呀！”这样，我们几个人连午饭也没吃，把八百多斤马草都翻了一遍，共找出十八节铁丝。我想：我们的马草都是用铁丝捆的，铡断的铁丝一般粗，这说明有一捆草里捆进了这样一根铁丝，铁丝两头应该是旧茬。于是我又把十八节铁丝一节节地检查一遍，两节带旧茬的都有。同志们高兴地说，这回是真找全了。
    是不是真的找全了呢？我还是不放心。捆草的铁丝都是一般长的。于是我把十八节铁丝对好茬口接起来，和整条铁丝一比，正好差一节。要在这八百多斤草里，找出一寸多长的铁丝，真不是件容易事！有的同志提出，喂马时好好筛筛，注意点就行了。我想，因为怕麻烦就把工作往后推，这是不负责任的表现。干工作，就怕认为有一点小问题没有关系，就不去注意它。我和同志们认识到了这一点，又反复找了几遍，终于从八百多斤草里，把这一寸多长的铁丝找出来了。
    通过这件事，同志们和我都深深地感到，在工作中，在节骨眼上，这种一丝不苟的精神非常重要。没有这种精神，对工作“极端负责”，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务就是一句空话。学习“老三篇”，就要把这种精神真正学到手。
