Editor's Note: In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe, following the success of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," has once again staged the high-spirited and magnificent revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Port" on the capital's stage. This is another victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the revolutionization of Peking opera.

"The Port" reflects the struggles of Chinese dock workers in the 1960s. The dock is a place of storms. This play depicts the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the hearts of the younger generation, and the struggle between two worldviews: one of extreme dedication to the revolutionary cause and the other of pursuing comfort and pleasure. Through this struggle, the play portrays Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, passionately praising their heroic spirit and revolutionary resolve to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggles of the people who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, the Chinese people have carried forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism and made their due contributions to actively supporting the world revolution. "The Port" vividly reflects this theme.

How revolutionary Peking opera quickly reflects the current fiery struggles and presents the new spirit of the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, "The Port" has made efforts in this regard and taken a valuable step.

In 1964, the Zhou Yang clique spread a counter-revolutionary wind against the revolution of Peking opera, one of their fallacies being the "division of labor theory," claiming that Peking opera cannot reflect modern life. The performance of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Port" has once again powerfully refuted the fallacies of the "division of labor theory" of the Zhou Yang clique, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary proletarian faction.

We fervently hope that more heroic deeds of our people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will be reflected on the revolutionary Peking opera stage.

The Peking opera "The Port" truly reflects the life of us dock workers, portraying dock workers with a heart for the nation and an eye on the world. We feel especially close to it. This play, we understand as soon as we hear it, the more we watch, the more we are energized, the more we like it. In the past, the stage was full of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. Today, seeing our revolutionary dock workers standing proudly on the stage, we feel proud and have a thousand words to say.

Looking back, we, these urban "laborers," had nothing but two hands and a pole. Under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism's "three big mountains," we were worried about food, clothing, and shelter, and endured beatings, scoldings, and persecution. Not to mention going on stage, we didn't even have the right to watch a play in the audience. I have worked on the dock for thirty-six years, and at that time, the working conditions were extremely poor. Hundreds of pounds of goods were all shouldered, shouldered, and many class brothers were bent over and broken-backed; many class brothers went from strong and healthy to weak and exhausted, finally ending up on the streets, freezing to death in toilets and under eaves. We were not willing to be exploited and oppressed, and under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party of China, we united and fought bravely time and time again against exploitation, oppression, and feudal foremen.

After liberation, we became the true masters of the dock under the wise leadership of the great Party and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. We managed and built the dock with revolutionary spirit. Following Chairman Mao's instruction of "self-reliance," relying on the revolutionary wisdom of all dock workers, we carried out extensive technological innovations and technological revolutions. Now, cranes line the docks of Shanghai. Politically, we, who were once called "stinking workers" by the bourgeoisie, have completely turned the tables. Some have become skilled workers, some have become enterprise leaders, some have become labor models, and some have even become people's representatives. Especially in recent years, we dock workers have read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, producing a large number of active learners and users of Chairman Mao's works. Our spiritual face has greatly changed.

We like the play "The Port" because it depicts the struggles and heroic spirit of dock workers, showing the high patriotism, internationalism, and the determination to carry the revolution through of dock workers. The loading and unloading team depicted in the play is a heroic collective. Team leader Gao Zhiyang is the most outstanding representative. He is an excellent worker armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with a heart loyal to the people and the revolution. He always, in everything, acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. He has both great aspirations and is down-to-earth, diligent, and meticulous. He cares about the affairs of the state and the world, as well as his class brothers. Mao Zedong Thought shines in him. Old worker Ma Hongliang also left a deep impression on me. Although he is old and retired, his thoughts have not retired; he is still closely connected with the dock and the revolutionary cause. He loves the dock deeply and cares about the growth of the next generation of dock workers. He came to the dock, saw the workers rushing to unload bags of wheat, and voluntarily joined the battle, picking up the bags of wheat himself. This vividly shows his spirit of "though old, the heart is young." These characters have given me great education.

The performance of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Port" is a great encouragement and a good spur to us dock workers. Although I am over fifty years old, with Mao Zedong Thought, I feel young and full of energy. I will definitely learn from the heroes and models on the industrial and agricultural fronts and from the heroes depicted in "The Port," forever following Chairman Mao to make revolution, wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world!

### 学习英雄　革命到底

    编者按　在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，上海革命京剧文工团继《智取威虎山》之后，又在首都舞台上演出了基调高昂、气魄豪迈的革命现代京剧《海港》，这是毛泽东思想在京剧革命化方面的又一胜利。
    《海港》反映了六十年代中国码头工人的斗争生活。码头上面有风浪。这出戏表现了无产阶级与资产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争，和对待革命事业极端负责与追求安逸享受的两种世界观的斗争，并通过这场斗争塑造了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人的英雄形象，热情地歌颂了他们完全彻底地为中国人民服务，为世界人民服务的豪情壮志和革命胸怀。
    毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我国人民遵循伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，为积极支援世界革命作出自己应有的贡献。《海港》十分真切地反映了这个主题。
    革命的京剧如何迅速地反映当前火热的斗争生活，表现用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级崭新的精神面貌，《海港》在这方面作了努力的探索，迈出了可贵的一步。
    一九六四年，周扬一伙曾经刮起了一股反对京剧革命的妖风，他们的一个谬论就是“分工论”，说什么京剧不能反映现代生活。革命现代京剧《海港》的演出，又一次有力地驳斥了周扬一伙“分工论”的谬论，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。
    我们热烈地希望，在革命京剧舞台上更多地反映用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国人民的英雄业绩。

    京剧《海港》真实地反映了我们码头工人的生活，塑造了胸怀祖国、放眼世界的码头工人形象。我们感到特别亲切。这出戏，我们一听就懂，越看越有劲，越看越喜欢。过去舞台上尽是些帝王将相、才子佳人。今天，看到我们革命的码头工人威风凛凛地站在舞台上，真是扬眉吐气，感到有千言万语要说。
    想想以前，我们这些城市“苦力”，除了两只手，一根杠棒以外，一无所有。在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义“三座大山”的压迫下，愁吃、愁穿、愁住，挨打、挨骂、受迫害。不用说上台，就是在台下看戏也没有资格。我在码头上整整做了三十六年工，那时候的劳动条件十分恶劣，几百斤重的货物都是肩膀扛呀，扛呀，多少阶级兄弟被压弯了腰、压断了脊梁；多少阶级兄弟由身强力壮干到体衰力尽，最后流落街头，冻死在厕所里、廊檐底下。我们是不甘心被剥削被压迫的，我们在工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下，团结起来一次又一次地展开了反剥削、反压迫、反封建把头的英勇斗争。
    解放后，我们又在伟大的党和最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，真正成了码头的主人。我们用革命精神自己管理码头，自己建设码头。我们按照毛主席“自力更生”的指示，依靠全体码头工人的革命智慧，大搞技术革新、技术革命。现在，上海各码头上吊车成林。在政治上，我们这些过去被资产阶级老爷们骂为“臭小工”的码头工人，彻底翻了身。有的成了技术工人，有的当上企业的领导，有的当了劳动模范，有的还当上了人民代表。特别是最近几年，我们码头工人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，涌现出了大批活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，我们码头工人的精神面貌大大变了样。
    我们喜欢《海港》这出戏，因为它表现了我们码头工人的斗争生活和豪迈气概，表现了码头工人高度的爱国主义、国际主义精神和将革命进行到底的决心。戏中所描写的装卸组，是一个英雄的集体。组长高志扬是其中最突出的代表。他是用毛泽东思想武装起来的优秀工人，他有一颗忠于人民忠于革命的红心。他时时、事事、处处都按照毛主席的指示办事。他既有雄心壮志，又踏实肯干、一丝不苟，他关心国家、世界的大事，也关心自己的阶级兄弟。在他的身上闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。老工人马洪亮也留给我深刻的印象。他虽然年老退休，离开了码头，但他的思想没有退休，还和码头、革命事业紧紧连在一起。他对码头怀着深沉的爱，关心着搬运事业的接班人的成长。他来到码头，看到工人们抢运麦包，自己也自动投入战斗，动手扛麦包。这生动地表现出他“人老心不老”的精神面貌。这些人物都给了我很大的教育。
    革命现代京剧《海港》的演出，对我们码头工人是个极大的鼓舞，也是很好的鞭策。我虽然年纪五十多岁了，但是有了毛泽东思想，就感到自己的年纪还轻，劲头还很大，我一定要向工农业战线上的英雄模范学习，向《海港》中所描写的英雄学习，永远跟着毛主席闹革命，全心全意为中国人民服务，为世界革命人民服务！
