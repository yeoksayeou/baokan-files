Among the more than one thousand victimized overseas Chinese, there were forty-one youths who had been illegally detained for forty days by the Medan military authorities. They armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and engaged in an unyielding struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries, a struggle that was both heroic and moving.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 24th, Guanghua Ship: The 1,076 Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese who were brought back to the motherland by the Guanghua Ship on its second voyage, filled with boundless love for our most respected great leader Chairman Mao and the socialist motherland, departed from the port of Medan, Indonesia, on November 20th and returned to the motherland.

This batch of returning overseas Chinese came from more than ten places in the Indonesian North Sumatra region, most of whom are laboring people. They were first subjected to arson, looting, and various forms of humiliation by the Indonesian reactionaries in the places where they originally resided. Later, they were concentrated in a "reception center" in Medan that was akin to a concentration camp, where they lived in inhuman conditions. Some of them had their husbands killed by Indonesian thugs, and some had their children slaughtered. When these overseas Chinese, who had been subjected to the insane persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries, boarded the Guanghua Ship, they were warmly greeted by the entire crew of the Guanghua Ship and the members of the Chinese government's reception team. Many of the victimized overseas Chinese, upon boarding the ship and seeing their fellow countrymen, said their first words: "Thank you, Chairman Mao!" "Thank you, the people of the motherland!"

Among this batch of returning victimized overseas Chinese, there were forty-one youths who were arbitrarily arrested by the Medan military authorities on October 10th and illegally detained for forty days. This group, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and filled with love for Chairman Mao and the motherland, engaged in a heroic and moving struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries in prison. Through repeated negotiations by the Chinese government and their brave struggle, the Indonesian authorities had to declare them innocent and release them from prison on November 18th. On the 20th, these forty-one youth victims boarded the Guanghua Ship in a victorious manner, singing revolutionary songs and marching in formation. To express their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their unwavering loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, they had sewn a red flag in prison with the words "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and made a five-pointed star with a picture of Chairman Mao in the center and forty-one small red stars surrounding it. This time, they brought them back to the motherland to present to the beloved Chairman Mao.

The Guanghua Ship, which was tasked with bringing back the second batch of victimized overseas Chinese, had already arrived at the port of Medan on November 6th. Due to the new obstacles set up by the Indonesian military authorities for the reception work and their organization of thugs to violently attack the victimized overseas Chinese in the "reception center" of the Medan Chinese School on November 9th, causing a serious bloody incident and disrupting the Chinese reception work, the Guanghua Ship had to stay in Medan for nearly fifteen days. Through repeated negotiations and struggles by the Chinese government and the Chinese consul in Medan, the evil plot of the Indonesian authorities to obstruct and sabotage the Chinese reception work was exposed, allowing the Guanghua Ship to finally successfully bring back the second batch of victimized overseas Chinese. Some of the patriotic overseas Chinese who had engaged in a courageous struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries during the bloody suppression of the Medan Chinese School victims by the Medan military authorities also returned to the motherland on the Guanghua Ship.

Ten women of Indonesian descent who married overseas Chinese, along with their relatives, also voluntarily chose to settle in China this time and were warmly welcomed by the Chinese government's reception team and the crew of the Guanghua Ship. After boarding the Guanghua Ship, they happily said: We are all very happy to be able to go to China with our husbands!

On the day this batch of victimized overseas Chinese boarded the Guanghua Ship, thousands of Indonesian people and local overseas Chinese, despite the obstruction of Indonesian right-wing military personnel, crossed over the iron gate from a corner of the pier and rushed to the pier in groups to enthusiastically see them off. Foreign ships docked next to the Guanghua Ship hoisted the five-star red flag of China and hung banners to pay tribute to the brave and struggling victimized overseas Chinese. The crowd of well-wishers, along with the victimized overseas Chinese and the crew of the Guanghua Ship, sang revolutionary songs and shouted slogans together, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Communist Party of China!" Despite the Indonesian authorities ordering soldiers to fire shots in an attempt to disperse the crowd, the scene of the send-off became more and more lively. Amidst the intertwined revolutionary songs and slogans on the pier and the ship, the Guanghua Ship departed from the port of Medan.

    满怀对伟大领袖毛主席和社会主义祖国的无限热爱
    第二批受害侨胞乘光华轮离印尼回国
    在一千多难侨中，有四十一名青少年，曾被棉兰陆军当局非法拘留四十天之久。他们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，向印尼反动派进行了可歌可泣的顽强斗争
    据新华社二十四日讯光华轮消息：由光华轮第二批接运回国的印度尼西亚受害华侨一千零七十六人，满怀对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和社会主义祖国的无限热爱，已于十一月二十日离开印尼棉兰勿拉湾港回国。
    这一批回国的难侨，来自印尼亚齐地区的十多个地方，大部分是劳动人民。他们先在原来侨居的地方受到印尼反动派的烧杀抢劫和百般凌辱，后来又被集中在棉兰集中营式的“收容所”里过着非人的生活。他们当中有些人的丈夫被印尼暴徒杀害，有些人的子女被屠杀。当这些遭到印尼反动派疯狂迫害的侨胞登上光华轮时，受到光华轮全体船员和随船中国政府接侨工作组人员最亲切的问候。许多难侨上船见到祖国亲人的第一句话就说：“感谢毛主席！”“感谢祖国人民！”
    在这批回国难侨中，有四十一名华侨青少年，曾在十月十日被棉兰陆军当局无理逮捕，并被非法拘留四十天之久。这个由毛泽东思想武装起来的热爱毛主席、热爱祖国的战斗集体，在狱中同印尼反动派进行了可歌可泣的顽强斗争。经过我国政府的反复交涉和他们的英勇斗争，印尼当局不得不宣布他们无罪，在十一月十八日释放他们出狱。二十日，这四十一名青少年难侨，以胜利者的姿态，高唱革命歌曲，列队最先登上光华轮。他们为了表达对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对毛泽东思想的无限忠诚，曾在狱中绣制成一面有着“毛主席万岁！”字样的红旗，还做了一个中间贴着毛主席像，周围簇拥着四十一颗小红星的五角星。这次他们把它们都带回了祖国，准备献给敬爱的毛主席。
    接运第二批受害侨胞的光华轮，早在十一月六日就已驶抵棉兰勿拉湾港。由于印尼陆军当局对接侨工作设置了新的重重障碍，并在十一月九日组织暴徒疯狂袭击棉兰华侨中学“收容所”的难侨，制造了严重的流血事件，破坏中国接侨工作的进行，使光华轮不得不在勿拉湾停泊了近十五天。经过我国政府以及中国驻棉兰领事的反复交涉斗争，揭穿了印尼当局阻挠和破坏中国接侨工作的罪恶阴谋，才使光华轮终于胜利地接回第二批难侨。在棉兰陆军当局血腥镇压棉兰华侨中学难侨事件中，曾经同印尼反动派进行过英勇的抗暴斗争的部分爱国侨胞，也随光华轮回国了。
    有十位嫁给华侨的印尼血统的妇女，和她们的亲属一起，这次也自愿到中国安家落户，受到中国政府接侨工作人员和光华轮船员的热烈欢迎。她们登上光华轮后，高兴地说：我们能够跟丈夫一起到中国，都感到很幸福！
    这批受害难侨登上光华轮的当天，上千的印尼人民和当地华侨，不顾印尼右派军人的阻挡，从码头的一角越过铁门，成群结队冲到码头上热烈欢送。停泊在光华轮旁边的外国轮船，升起我五星国旗，挂起标语，向英勇斗争的受害华侨致敬。欢送人群同受害华侨和光华轮海员一起高唱革命歌曲，连声欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”在三个多小时的难侨陆续登船的过程中，尽管印尼当局曾指使军人鸣枪镇压，企图驱散欢送人群，但是欢送的场面越来越热烈。在码头上和船上交织成一片的革命歌声和口号声中，光华轮驶离了勿拉湾港口。
