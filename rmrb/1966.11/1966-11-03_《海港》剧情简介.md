The Shanghai Revolutionary Beijing Opera Troupe's production of "Harbor" is a revolutionary modern Beijing opera based on the labor and struggle of Shanghai dock workers in the 1960s. It vividly reflects the grandeur of the Chinese people, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, dedicating themselves to the country, looking at the world, and actively supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The story of "Harbor" takes place in the summer of 1963. Gao Zhiyang, the foreman of a cargo-handling team at a certain dock in Shanghai, leads his team of workers with great enthusiasm to load rice for export, supporting the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Due to the foreign ship's request for an early departure, an impending storm, and the urgent need to move the wheat in the yard into the warehouse, there was a shortage of machinery. Gao Zhiyang's team, embodying the spirit of communism, voluntarily gave up all the machinery and bravely shouldered the task of carrying the wheat into the warehouse.

Young worker Han Xiaqiang, influenced by the bourgeois ideology of the warehouse keeper Qian Shouwei, was discontented with his work on the dock. During the rush to move the wheat, Han Xiaqiang dropped a sack of wheat; in the hurry, this sack was mistakenly loaded onto a barge as rice and sent to the foreign ship.

After work, Gao Zhiyang inspected the scene and found scattered wheat on the ground, immediately reporting to the party branch secretary Fang Haizhen. The cargo-handling team leader Zhao Zhenshan also brought a report from Han Xiaqiang requesting a transfer. Fang Haizhen, facing this complex situation, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, deciding to get to the bottom of the matter and conduct an investigation.

Just then, Gao Zhiyang discovered that the scattered wheat sacks were contaminated with glass fibers dropped by Qian Shouwei. With a strong sense of political responsibility and a determination to ensure the high standards and quality of the exported goods, Fang Haizhen supported Gao Zhiyang's suggestion to search the warehouse at night to find the scattered sacks and eliminate the accident. The dock workers responded to the party branch's call, embodying the revolutionary spirit of proletarian internationalism, and joined the battle to search the warehouse.

In the night, Han Xiaqiang heard the news and rushed to the scene, intending to confess to the scattered sacks, but was misled by Qian Shouwei's nonsense and did not listen to the well-intentioned advice of the retired worker Ma Hongliang, leaving in discontent.

The search of the warehouse yielded no scattered sacks, and our distant ocean liner "Changfeng" was due to dock at dawn to load this batch of wheat. Faced with the difficulty, Fang Haizhen recalled Chairman Mao's teachings and suddenly saw clearly. She and the workers together found out that the scattered wheat sacks had been mistaken for rice and loaded onto the barge, heading to Wusong. Therefore, Gao Zhiyang braved the storm and went out to sea to chase the barge.

Under the serious and sincere education and help from Fang Haizhen and the retired worker Ma Hongliang, and inspired by Gao Zhiyang's brave act of going out to sea, Han Xiaqiang realized the glorious responsibility of dock workers, understanding that every package and item loaded relates to the honor of our great motherland and the world revolution. He expressed his determination to correct his mistakes and become a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

At dawn, Gao Zhiyang retrieved the scattered sacks and returned to the harbor in victory. At this moment, the whistle blew long, and the dock workers' songs filled with internationalist spirit and ambition echoed through the sky.

    《海港》剧情简介
    上海革命京剧文工团演出的《海港》，是一出以六十年代上海码头工人的劳动和斗争生活为题材的革命现代京剧。它生动地反映出我国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，胸怀祖国，放眼全球，积极支援世界人民革命的壮丽情景。
    《海港》的故事发生在一九六三年夏天。上海港某码头装卸组长高志扬，带领全组工人干劲十足地装运出国大米，支援亚非拉人民的反帝斗争。由于外轮要求提前启航，雷雨又将袭击港湾，还急需把场地上的小麦抢运进仓，因此发生了机械不够用的困难。高志扬小组发扬共产主义风格，让出全部机械，自告奋勇地用双肩扛运小麦进仓。
    青年工人韩小强，受了留用仓库员钱守维的资产阶级思想影响以后，对码头装卸工作很不安心。在抢运中，韩小强跌散麦包；匆忙间，这个散包又被误当作大米，装上了驳船，送往外轮。
    下班时，高志扬检查现场，发现地上散麦，立即向支部书记方海珍汇报。装卸队长赵震山又带来韩小强请求调离工作的报告。方海珍面对这一复杂情况，重温了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，决定追根究底，进行调查。
    正当此时，高志扬又发现扫来的散包麦里沾有被钱守维撒落的玻璃纤维。本着高度的政治责任心，坚决保证出国物资的高标准、高质量，方海珍支持高志扬的建议，连夜翻仓，要查出散包，消灭事故。码头工人响应党支部的号召，发扬无产阶级国际主义的革命精神，投入了翻仓战斗。
    深夜，韩小强听到消息后赶来，准备承认散包之事，但又为钱守维胡言乱语所迷惑，听不进退休老工人马洪亮的好意劝告，不欢而去。
    翻仓结果，不见散包，而我们远洋巨轮“长风”号，天亮就要靠岸，装运这批小麦。在困难的面前，方海珍想起毛主席的教导，顿时眼明心亮。她和工人一起，查明了散包小麦已错当大米，装上驳船，开往吴淞。因此，高志扬冒着风浪，出江追赶驳船。
    韩小强在方海珍和退休老工人马洪亮严肃恳切的教育帮助下，在高志扬冒险出江的英勇行为感召下，认识到了码头工人的光荣责任，装运一包一件都关系到伟大祖国的荣誉和世界革命，因此，表示坚决改正错误，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    清晨，高志扬追回散包，胜利返港。这时，汽笛长鸣，码头工人充满国际主义豪情壮志的歌声，响彻云霄。
