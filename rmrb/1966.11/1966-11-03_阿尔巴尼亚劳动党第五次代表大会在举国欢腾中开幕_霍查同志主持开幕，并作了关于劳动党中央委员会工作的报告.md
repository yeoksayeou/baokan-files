The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour opened in a festive atmosphere in the newly built Cultural Palace Hall in Tirana at 8 a.m. today.

Enver Hoxha, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, presided over the opening and delivered a report on the work of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour.

In the streets and alleys of the capital, Tirana, people sang and danced, enthusiastically sending off the representatives attending the congress to the venue. In front of the Cultural Palace, on Skanderbeg Square, red flags were flying, and thousands of citizens had gathered there early to welcome the representatives and foreign guests attending the congress.
