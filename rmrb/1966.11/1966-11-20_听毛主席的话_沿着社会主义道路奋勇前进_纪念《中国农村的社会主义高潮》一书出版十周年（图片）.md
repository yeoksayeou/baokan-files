The cadres and members of Xipu Brigade, Jianming Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, have deeply felt in practice that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood, and following Chairman Mao means victory. This is the brigade party branch secretary, Wang Guozhan (left one), using the rest time in the fields to study "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with the community members.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the party branch of Nanwangzhuang Brigade, Anping County, Hebei Province, has steadfastly led the community members to walk the socialist road. The three poor peasants who insisted on the cooperative path at that time, Wang Yukun (left three), Wang Xiaoqi (left one), and Wang Xiaopang (left two), are now all members of the party branch committee. Wang Yukun is also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a famous labor model nationwide, the chairman of Nanwangzhuang Commune, and the brigade leader of Nanwangzhuang Brigade. Wang Xiaoqi is the brigade's youth league secretary. Wang Xiaopang is the brigade's forestry team leader. This is them during a party branch committee meeting.

The party branch of Xiaoguang Brigade, Yujixi Commune, Jin County, Liaoning Province, never forgets Chairman Mao's instructions, grasps the revolution, and promotes production, causing significant changes in people's spiritual and productive appearances. Now, everyone in Xiaoguang Brigade is full of enthusiasm, grain production has increased, and the orchards are full. This is a corner of Xiaoguang Brigade's orchard.

The cadres and community members of Wutang Brigade, Chunhuashan Commune, Changsha County, Hunan Province, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, and continuously consolidate and develop the collective economy. Now, this brigade has many new agricultural machines. This is the community members of Hexin Production Team using the newly purchased rice harvester to harvest rice.

Lin Jinzhong (front), a middle peasant from Longfeng Brigade, Xiandou Commune, Hua'an County, Fujian Province, is Lin Jinjing from the article "A Good Experience in Whole Brigade Rectification." Ten years ago, he actively requested to join the commune and understood the benefits of running a commune from his personal experience. Over the past ten years, he has resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words, loved the collective, and worked hard. Now he serves as the deputy platoon leader of the militia and the deputy team leader of the Tulou Production Team.

Ten years ago, there was not a single flat road or a single protective forest belt in the Seman area of Shufu County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Uygur farmers followed Chairman Mao's instructions and insisted on the socialist path. Now, Seman Commune has many neat rows of forest belts.

In recent years, the party branch of Hongxing and Chongxin Production Brigades, Yong'an Commune, Fenggang County, Guizhou Province, and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to develop water conservancy extensively, transforming all the low-yield fields that relied on heaven for rain into fields that are guaranteed to produce in both drought and flood. This is the community members continuing to carry out basic farmland construction.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Chaoyang People's Commune, Chaoyang Township, Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province, have firmly walked the socialist road. They have followed Chairman Mao's instructions and, through arduous efforts, have transformed the barren salt flats of ten years ago (left) into fertile fields (right).

    听毛主席的话  沿着社会主义道路奋勇前进
    ——纪念《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书出版十周年
    河北省遵化县建明公社西铺大队的干部社员，在实践中深深地体会到，毛泽东思想是命根子，跟着毛主席走就是胜利。这是大队党支部书记王国藩（左一）利用田间休息时间，和社员一起学习《毛主席语录》。
    在毛泽东思想指引下，河北省安平县南王庄大队党支部坚定不移地带领社员走社会主义道路。当年坚持走合作化道路的三户贫农王玉坤（左三）、王小其（左一）、王小庞（左二），现在都是党支部委员。王玉坤又是全国政协委员、全国著名的劳动模范、南王庄公社社长、南王庄大队大队长。王小其是大队团支部书记。王小庞是大队林业队长。这是他们正在开党支部委员会。
    辽宁省锦县余积公社晓光大队党支部，时时不忘毛主席的教导，抓革命，促生产，使人的精神面貌和生产面貌发生了巨大的变化。如今的晓光大队人人干劲十足，粮食增产，果树满园。这是晓光大队果园的一角。
    湖南省长沙县春华山公社武塘大队的干部和社员，按照毛主席的教导，发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，使集体经济不断巩固和发展。如今，这个大队已经拥有许多新式农业机械。这是合心生产队的社员们在用新购置的割稻机割稻。
    福建省华安县仙都公社龙峰大队下中农社员林金钟（前），就是《一个整社的好经验》一文中介绍的林金精。十年前，他积极要求入社，从切身经验中，懂得了办社的好处。十年来，他坚决听毛主席的话，热爱集体，积极劳动。现在担任民兵副营长和土楼生产队副队长。
    新疆维吾尔自治区疏附县色满地区，十年前，没有一条平坦的道路，没有一条护田林带。维吾尔族农民遵照毛主席的教导，坚持走社会主义的道路。现在，色满公社出现了许多这样整整齐齐的林带。
    贵州省凤冈县永安公社红星、崇新生产大队党支部和广大贫下中农，近几年来，按照毛主席的指示，大兴水利，把全部靠天吃饭的低产田，都改造成旱涝保收田。这是社员们在继续进行农田基本建设。
    江苏省连云港市朝阳乡朝阳人民公社的广大贫下中农，坚定地走社会主义大道。他们遵照毛主席的教导，经过艰苦努力，已将十年前寸草不生的盐碱窝（左），改造成锦绣良田（右）。
