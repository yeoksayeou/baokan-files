	NEW DELHI, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour continued to be held in a revolutionary spirit on the 2nd and 3rd. The congress discussed the report on the work of the Central Committee by the first secretary of the Party Central Committee, Comrade Enver Hoxha. All representatives who spoke at the meeting unanimously and enthusiastically supported this report.

	Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and first secretary of the Tirana City Committee, M. Muftiu, spoke in detail about the Party's organizational construction and political and ideological work. He said that our Party is waging a resolute struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and their ideological influence. At the same time, the Party is deeply carrying out an ideological and cultural revolution and is waging a full-scale struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology. This struggle is a necessary condition for achieving complete victory in our country's socialist revolution.

	Muftiu emphasized that under these conditions, the primary task of Party organizations is to place ideological and political work in the first and foremost position, above everything else. Doing ideological and political work for people is the main task, and business work is subordinate to and serves political and ideological work.

	Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and first secretary of the Durres District Committee, R. Marko, said in his speech that our Party has formed a steel-like friendship with the powerful socialist bastion, the People's Republic of China, led by the great Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao Zedong.

	He emphasized the great significance of the series of revolutionary measures taken by the Party of Labour. He said that these measures are related to whether socialism can achieve a thorough victory in Albania, whether the baton of the socialist revolution can be passed to the reliable hands of the next generation, and whether the possibility of revisionism and capitalist restoration can be eliminated in Albania.

	Member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, H. List, pointed out in his speech that the Albanian Party of Labour regards power as the most powerful weapon in the hands of the people for socialist transformation and the defense of revolutionary victories. He pointed out that emphasizing politics and using a political perspective to recognize and solve all problems is the basic principle that must be followed in the activities of people's assemblies at all levels.

	He said that our Party has opposed and continues to oppose the "state of the whole people" view of modern revisionism, opposing modern revisionists' attempt to deceive the working masses and cause the withering away of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Minister of Foreign Affairs of Albania, N. Nasi, said in his speech that Albania's foreign policy is based on a profound revolutionary policy of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This policy has always been directed against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism, because imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of all countries, and modern revisionism is the most effective accomplice and agent of imperialism.

	Nasi said that the Khrushchev revisionists, through a series of hostile activities, attempted to strangle our Party and our people. However, we not only did not surrender but advanced even more boldly and appeared proudly on the international stage, receiving respect and admiration.

	Nasi strongly condemned the Soviet leadership's dealings with American imperialism on the Vietnam issue, engaging in "peace talks" conspiracies, and attempting to coerce the Vietnamese people together with American imperialism.

	Nasi said that the friendship and fighting unity between our people and Party and the brotherly Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong are indestructible. The two parties and peoples of the two countries will always stand together and will advance courageously in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership.

	Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and Central Secretary, H. Kaba, said in his speech that the Albanian Party of Labour will unite in a steel-like manner with the glorious Communist Party of China led by the great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, and with all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces in the world, resolutely opposing imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet traitor leadership. In the future, it will continue to excellently complete the historical mission of defending the international communist movement of Marxism-Leninism.

	Kaba said that the Albanian people and the Party of Labour are proud to have seven hundred million Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China as their loyal friends and true allies. He said that our people and Party are infinitely happy and inspired by the fact that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and great thoughts, have built a great China into an indestructible socialist bastion. In China, the economy and science and technology are developing at an unprecedented speed, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being successfully carried out, and the bright red flag of Marxism-Leninism is flying high. All proletarians, revolutionaries, and all people who love freedom and progress in the world are full of hope for the future and turn their eyes, thoughts, and hearts towards China.

	Kaba emphasized the need to strengthen the Party and further improve the political and ideological level of Party members. He stressed the importance of doing people's work, primarily educating the working people in Marxism-Leninism, and raising their socialist consciousness. When talking about strengthening the Party's leadership in economic construction, he emphasized the significance of politics leading economics.

	Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, B. Balluku, pointed out in his speech that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour is a great victory of the Party's correct Marxist-Leninist line, a congress that has achieved great victories in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism on the ideological, political, and military fronts, and a congress that further strengthens the unity of the people and our Party and its Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha.

	He said that Comrade Enver Hoxha's report is a document of historical significance. This document opens a new stage in the further development and strengthening of our socialist motherland, marking a higher new stage of revolutionary tempering for our people and Party, and thus making new contributions to the common treasury of Marxism-Leninism and revolution.

	Balluku pointed out that the current international situation is characterized by the further deepening of all basic contradictions in contemporary times, and the forces are in the process of division and reorganization, with Marxist-Leninist forces and anti-imperialist forces on one side and imperialist, reactionary, and modern revisionist forces on the other, engaged in extremely sharp struggles.

	He said that the most intense battle between American imperialism and revolutionary forces is currently taking place in Vietnam. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism has become a great example for all revolutionary peoples in the world, a touchstone to distinguish true friends from false friends of the Vietnamese people, to distinguish revolution from counter-revolution, to distinguish Marxism-Leninism from revisionism, and to distinguish true anti-imperialism from false anti-imperialism.

	Balluku said that under the wise leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, seven hundred million Chinese people are turning the People's Republic of China into a powerful socialist state with enormous economic and military strength, into an indestructible socialist bastion. The recent successful missile and nuclear weapon tests in China mark China's great progress in science and technology, which is an important factor in further strengthening China's defense forces, the failure of the Soviet-American nuclear monopoly conspiracy, and an important factor in encouraging the peoples of various countries to struggle.

	He pointed out that the Albanian People's Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are closely linked in their common struggle. The close cooperation between the two countries' armies comes from the profound class nature of the two countries' revolutionary armies. Our two armies are trained and cultivated by our two Marxist-Leninist parties and Comrade Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong.

	Balluku, when talking about the construction of the Albanian army, pointed out that Albania has resolutely implemented the mass line and implemented the policy of universal military service on the defense front. He said that the basic measure to strengthen our armed forces is to constantly strengthen the Party's leadership over the army.

	Balluku emphasized that our army has never been as united as it is today, our army has never been as well-equipped as it is today. Today, our army is closely united with our heroic people, ready to repel any invading enemy, and is prepared to defend our socialist motherland with a spirit of self-sacrifice.

	Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and Central Secretary, R. Aliya, elaborated in his speech on the current class struggle in Albanian society.

	He said that drawing lessons from the positive and negative experiences of the international communist movement, cutting off the spread of revisionism as the vanguard of political counter-revolution, and preventing the danger of capitalist restoration is the task of Marxist-Leninists. As a consistently revolutionary party, our Party is very concerned about this issue.

	He emphasized that class struggle continues throughout the entire period of transition from capitalism to socialism, and the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism is long-term, sharp, and complex. We draw serious lessons from this and must never forget class struggle. This struggle should continue, and the revolution on all fronts should be carried through to the end.

	Aliya exposed the crimes of revisionists who, for the sake of their betrayal, tried to erase the class struggle in the socialist period. He said that an Albanian proverb says well, "The river may stop, but the enemy will not sleep," and we should always remember this proverb. Aliya pointed out that in the current specific situation in Albania, class struggle on the ideological front has special significance. History has proven that all classes that seek to establish their political and economic rule in society first create public opinion. He said that proletarian ideology is our ruling ideology, but we cannot say that we have achieved complete victory in the socialist revolution in the fields of ideology and culture. All communists and working people in our country should wage sharp, fierce, and principled struggles to oppose bourgeois and revisionist ideologies and their influences in any form and place.

	Aliya pointed out that in Party work, revolutionary class education should become the main link in the entire Marxist-Leninist education. Educating young people and intellectuals with the spirit of class struggle and communism is of primary importance. Youth is the future of the country, and a generation that can excellently advance the revolutionary cause should be cultivated. Aliya said that we should continuously wage class struggle in all aspects of life. Correctly understanding the contradictions in our society, their nature, and the ways to resolve them, is of special significance for waging this struggle well and promoting our country's socialist construction. We should pay special attention to correctly handling contradictions within the people.

	During the two days of the meeting, the representatives also listened to the reports of the Central Committee's Inspection Commission and the Credentials Committee of the Congress. Member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, S. Pojani, spoke about amending and supplementing the Party Constitution. The Congress decided to establish a committee to review and amend the Party Constitution.

	On the 2nd and 3rd, the congress heard congratulatory speeches from the delegations of the Communist Party of China, the Labor Party of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Workers' Party of Korea, the Romanian Communist Party, the Communist Party of Indonesia, and the Communist Party of Japan, in addition to the delegation of the Communist Party of China.

	The Congress continued on the 4th.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大充满革命精神
    代表们发言一致热烈拥护霍查同志的报告
    代表们强调指出深入开展思想文化革命是争取社会主义革命完全胜利的必要条件；党采取的一系列革命化措施的目的在于根除产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的可能性；必须用阶级斗争和共产主义的精神来教育青年和知识分子；绝对不能忘记阶级斗争；坚决把反帝反修斗争进行到底。
    新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会在充满革命精神的气氛中，在二日和三日继续举行。大会讨论了党中央第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志所作的关于中央委员会的工作报告。所有在会上发言的代表都一致热烈拥护这个报告。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、地拉那市委第一书记马·穆夫蒂乌在发言中详细地谈到了党的组织建设和党的政治思想工作问题。他说，我们党正在进行一场反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、反对它们的思想影响的坚决斗争。同时，党正在深入开展思想文化革命，为反对资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想进行全力的斗争。这一斗争是争取我国社会主义革命完全胜利的必要条件。
    穆夫蒂乌强调指出，在这种条件下，党组织的首要任务，就是更好地、坚决地把思想和政治工作放在首位，置于一切之上。做人的政治思想工作是主要的工作，业务工作是为政治和思想服务的，是从属于它们的。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、都拉斯区委第一书记里·马尔科在发言中说，我们党同以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导下的强大的社会主义堡垒——中华人民共和国，结成了钢铁般的友谊。
    他强调指出劳动党采取的一系列革命化措施的重大意义。他说，这些措施关系到社会主义在阿尔巴尼亚能不能取得彻底的胜利，关系到社会主义革命的接力棒能不能传到下一代可靠的手中，关系到在阿尔巴尼亚能不能根除产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的可能性。
    劳动党中央委员、人民议会主席团主席哈·列希在发言中指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党认为政权是进行社会主义改造和捍卫革命胜利的人民手中的最强大的武器。他指出，突出政治、用政治眼光去认识和解决各项问题，是各级人民会议的一切活动所必须贯彻的基本原则。
    他说，我们党过去和现在一直反对现代修正主义的“全民国家”的观点，反对现代修正主义者企图以此来欺骗劳动群众，使无产阶级专政蜕化。
    阿尔巴尼亚外交部长奈·纳赛在发言中说，阿尔巴尼亚的外交政策是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的深刻的革命政策，这一政策的锋芒一贯指向以美国为首的帝国主义，指向现代修正主义，因为帝国主义是各国人民的共同敌人，现代修正主义是帝国主义最得力的帮凶和代理人。
    纳赛说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者通过一系列敌对活动，企图扼杀我们党和我国人民。但是我们不仅没有屈服，反而更加阔步前进，并以自豪的心情出现在国际舞台上，受到敬佩和尊敬。
    纳赛强烈谴责苏共领导在越南问题上同美帝国主义进行交易，大搞“和谈”阴谋，企图伙同美帝国主义压服越南人民。
    纳赛说，我国人民和我们党与兄弟的中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党之间的友谊和战斗团结是牢不可破的。我们两党两国人民将永远站在一起，并将在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中勇往直前。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、中央书记希·卡博在发言中说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党要同以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党、同全世界马克思列宁主义政党和力量钢铁般地团结在一起，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共叛徒领导为首的现代修正主义，今后还将继续出色地完成保卫马克思列宁主义的国际共产主义运动的历史使命。
    卡博说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和劳动党为有七亿中国人民和光荣的中国共产党作为自己的忠诚的朋友和真正的同盟者而感到骄傲。他说，我国人民和我们党感到无限高兴和受到鼓舞的是，中国人民在毛泽东同志的学说和伟大思想的照耀下，把伟大的中国建成了一个坚不可摧的社会主义堡垒，在中国，经济和科学技术以空前的速度发展着，无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利开展，鲜明的马克思列宁主义的胜利红旗高高飘扬。全世界无产阶级、革命者和一切爱好自由与进步的人民充满对未来的希望，都把眼睛、思想和心，朝着中国。
    卡博强调必须加强党，更加提高党员的政治思想水平，要做人的工作，首先是对劳动人民进行马克思列宁主义的教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟。他在谈到加强党对经济建设的领导时，强调指出了政治统帅经济的意义。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝·巴卢库在发言中指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会是党的马克思列宁主义正确路线的伟大胜利的大会，是我们党在同帝国主义和现代修正主义的双重封锁作斗争中，在思想、政治和军事战线上取得伟大胜利的大会，是进一步加强人民和我们党及其以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的中央委员会的团结的大会。
    他说，恩维尔·霍查同志的报告是具有历史意义的文件。这个文件开辟了进一步发展和加强我们社会主义祖国的新阶段，它标志着我国人民和我们党经受革命锻炼的更高的新阶段，从而为马克思列宁主义和革命的共同宝库作出新的贡献。
    巴卢库指出，目前国际形势的特点是，当代所有的基本矛盾进一步深化，各种力量正处在分化和改组的过程，以马克思列宁主义力量和反对帝国主义的力量为一方，以帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义势力为一方进行着极其尖锐的斗争。
    他说，当前，美帝国主义和革命力量之间最激烈的战斗正在越南进行。越南人民反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争成了全世界一切革命人民的伟大榜样，成了区别越南人民的真朋友和假朋友、区别革命和反革命、区别马克思列宁主义和修正主义、区别真反帝和假反帝的试金石。
    巴卢库说，七亿中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的英明领导下，正在把中华人民共和国变成一个拥有巨大经济和军事力量的社会主义强大国家，变成一个不可摧毁的社会主义堡垒。最近在中国胜利进行的发射导弹核武器试验，标志着中华人民共和国在科学技术方面的巨大进步，这是中国国防力量进一步加强的重要因素，是苏美核垄断阴谋的破产，是鼓舞各国人民进行斗争的重要因素。
    他指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民军和中国人民解放军在共同的斗争中紧密联系在一起。两国军队之间的紧密的合作来源于两国革命军队的深刻阶级性。我们两国军队是由我们两个马克思列宁主义的党和恩维尔·霍查同志与毛泽东同志一手教育培养起来的。
    巴卢库在谈到阿尔巴尼亚军队建设时指出，阿尔巴尼亚在国防战线上坚决地贯彻了群众路线，实行了全民皆兵。他说，加强我国武装力量的基本措施是经常加强党对军队的领导。
    巴卢库强调说，我们的军队从来没有过像今天这样团结，我们的军队从来没有过像今天这样好的装备。今天，我们的军队紧密地同我国英雄的人民团结在一起，准备打退一切来犯的敌人，以自我牺牲的精神坚决保卫社会主义祖国。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、中央书记拉·阿利雅在发言中，详细地阐述了阿尔巴尼亚社会当前的阶级斗争问题。
    他说，从国际共产主义运动的正反面经验吸取教训，截断传播作为政治反革命急先锋的修正主义的道路，防止资本主义复辟的危险，是马克思列宁主义者的任务。作为一贯革命的党，我们党十分关心这个问题。
    他强调指出，在由资本主义向社会主义过渡的整个时期，阶级斗争在继续进行，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争是长期的，尖锐的和复杂的。我们从这里吸取严重的教训，绝对不应该忘记阶级斗争，这种斗争应该继续进行，各条战线上的革命应该进行到底。
    阿利雅揭露了修正主义者出于他们背叛的目的，抹煞社会主义时期的阶级斗争的罪行。他说，阿尔巴尼亚民间谚语说得好，“河水可以停息，敌人不会睡觉”，我们应该永远记住这个谚语。阿利雅指出，在阿尔巴尼亚当前的具体形势下，思想战线上的阶级斗争，具有特殊的意义。历史证明，所有为在社会上建立自己的政治和经济统治的阶级，都是先制造舆论。他说，无产阶级思想是我们的统治思想，但是，不能说，我们已经在思想和文化领域中取得了社会主义革命的完全胜利。我国全体共产党员和劳动群众都应该进行尖锐的、激烈的、原则性的斗争，来反对资产阶级和修正主义的各种思想观点，反对它们在任何形式下、在任何地方所表现的一切影响。
    阿利雅指出，在党的工作中，革命的阶级教育应该成为整个马克思列宁主义教育的主要环节。用阶级斗争和共产主义的精神来教育青年和知识分子，具有首要的意义。青年是国家的未来，应该培养青年一代成为能够出色地推进革命事业的一代。阿利雅说，我们应该不断地在生活的所有方面开展阶级斗争。正确地理解我国社会的矛盾、它们的性质和解决它们的途径，对很好地开展这一斗争，促进我国的社会主义建设，具有特殊的意义。我们应该特别重视正确处理人民内部矛盾。
    在这两天的会议上，代表们还先后听取了党中央检查委员会的工作报告和大会资格审查委员会的报告。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员萨·波查伊作了关于修改和补充党章的发言。大会决定成立审查和修改党章委员会。
    在二日和三日会议上向大会致贺词的，除中国共产党代表团以外，还有越南劳动党、越南南方民族解放阵线、朝鲜劳动党、罗马尼亚共产党、印度尼西亚共产党和日本共产党的代表团。
    大会在四日继续举行。
