The Chinese Folk Song and Dance Troupe left Beijing in mid-June and has since visited Yemen, Zambia, Syria, the United Arab Republic, the Gaza Strip of Palestine, and Iraq. Currently, they are visiting Uganda. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not only bringing revolutionary songs and dances to the peoples of Asia and Africa, but also embodying the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought with their new appearance. They have been warmly praised by the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa, who call them the "Art Troupe Sent by Chairman Mao."

Serving the World's People

The troupe members always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and for their use." Wherever they go, they perform revolutionary songs and dances for the people. By the Mediterranean Sea where fishermen from the Suez Canal in the United Arab Republic work, on the slopes of the Hijaz Mountains in Yemen, in the Palestinian refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, by the roadside, in factories... wherever there are audiences, they perform. They can perform for tens of thousands of people in a square or for just one person on the road. They deeply understand the urgent desire of the revolutionary peoples of various countries to love Mao Zedong Thought and to appreciate Chinese revolutionary art.

In Yemen's Ib, after the troupe finished their visit and were about to leave by car, groups of Yemeni women climbed mountains to reach the troupe's residence. When they learned that the performances had ended and the troupe was about to leave, they felt very regretful. They excitedly held the hands of the Chinese female performers, reluctant to part. More and more people gathered, but the costumes and props were already loaded onto the car, and it was time to depart. What to do? Should they let them leave disappointed? No! They couldn't. The teachings of Chairman Mao on serving the people inspired all members of the troupe. The troupe immediately decided: delay the departure and perform on the spot. The troupe's residence instantly became a performance venue for the Yemeni women. Many Yemeni women were so moved that they took off their veils, held the hands of the Chinese female performers, and enthusiastically said, "The best people in the world, stay! You stay!" "We can't bear to see you go!"

On the way from Ib City to Taiz, the troupe performed for the local residents gathered on a hillside when passing a high mountain. The villagers were so moved that they spontaneously danced with the performers, creating a joyful atmosphere of friendship between Chinese and Yemeni peoples on the once quiet hillside. When the performance ended, a Yemeni friend quickly climbed a hilltop and shouted from the heart, "Farewell, Chinese brothers!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Yemen!" The car drove away, but the voice still echoed in the valley.

Acting According to Chairman Mao's Teachings

Wherever the troupe members go, they act as ordinary workers, loading and unloading the stage and carrying props by themselves; after the performance, they clean the performance venue thoroughly. In Yemen's port of Hudaydah, they encountered a heavy downpour and, together with all the team members, unloaded the car and set up the stage in the rain. Many Yemeni friends were deeply moved by this scene for the first time and spontaneously worked with the troupe members. An old Yemeni man who helped clean the stage said excitedly, "I have never seen artists like you who love labor so much. You are artists and also workers."

In the hotel, the performers cleaned their rooms themselves and even helped the service staff wash dishes in the kitchen. People first looked at them with bewilderment and surprise, then praised them endlessly. A Syrian chef said, "You are all people of high moral character. Only you Chinese artists respect us and work with us." A Syrian who accompanied the Chinese Folk Song and Dance Troupe said, "The whole of Damascus is praising you as the most moral people in the world because you act according to Chairman Mao's teachings."

The Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought

Although the troupe members' performances were very busy, they insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works in their spare time, drawing inspiration and strength from them.

When imperialists caused trouble, when they encountered difficulties during performances, or when there were problems at work, they would open the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and study Chairman Mao's teachings with concentration. During their 20-day visit to Zambia, they performed 20 shows, often changing locations daily. However, they could go without food or sleep, but they could not go without reading Chairman Mao's works. They read Chairman Mao's books with a sense of urgency. Before the performance began, in the car, in the waiting room, in the newly arrived hotel waiting for room allocation, during rehearsal breaks, in the late-night performance evaluation meetings... everywhere they were studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, everywhere they were thinking deeply and discussing passionately.

The chorus members insisted on collective study of Chairman Mao's quotations every night after the performance. They said, "It doesn't matter if the body is a bit tired, but it is terrible if the mind is tired. Only by studying Chairman Mao's works can the mind always stay young and never tire."

In Yemen's Hudaydah, the heat made it difficult to apply makeup, and sweat washed away the facial paint repeatedly. Comrades from the north had never experienced such extreme heat, and even breathing was difficult. At this time, they were about to perform "The Oil Workers' Victory Song," and they thought of the difficulties created by the Khrushchev revisionist clique for China, burning with indignation. The performance must be excellent, and it must show the great spirit of the Chinese people who are invincible and unstoppable! They opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory." These seventeen golden words gave them endless strength and encouragement. No matter how high the temperature, it could not surpass the determination of revolutionary cultural warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades overcame the heat, and the performance was a complete success.

To express support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Palestinian Arab people, the troupe created and rehearsed a dance "We Will Definitely Return to Our Homeland" in just two days before their visit to the Gaza Strip. It was already midnight, but the rehearsal was still ongoing. They opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud, "The people who have already won the revolution should support the struggle of the people who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The comrades thought of themselves working to support the struggle of the Palestinian people and felt an immense power. With everyone's efforts, in just two days, they created this song and dance symbolizing the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Palestinian peoples against American imperialism. During the performance in Gaza, many people were so moved that they shed tears, saying, "You are truly supporting us. Your program most sincerely expresses the wishes of the Palestinian people."

    毛主席派来的艺术团
    ——记在亚非一些国家和地区进行访问演出的中国民间歌舞团
    中国民间歌舞团从六月中旬离开北京，已经访问了也门、赞比亚、叙利亚、阿联、巴勒斯坦加沙地区和伊拉克，目前正在乌干达进行访问。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不仅以革命的歌舞给亚、非人民送来了毛泽东思想，还以自己崭新的精神面貌体现了毛泽东思想，受到了亚非广大革命人民的热烈称赞。人们赞扬他们是“毛主席派来的艺术团”。
    为世界人民服务
    歌舞团牢记毛主席的教导：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”演员们走到哪里，就深入到人民中间，为他们演出革命歌舞。在阿联塞得港渔民捕鱼的地中海畔，在也门赫贾兹山的山坡上，在加沙地区的巴勒斯坦难民营里，在大路旁，在车间里……，只要那里有观众，就在那里演出，可以在广场上为上万人演出，也可以在旅途中为一个人表演。他们深深地理解各国革命人民热爱毛泽东思想、渴望欣赏中国革命艺术的迫切心情。
    在也门的伊卜，歌舞团结束访问后，准备乘车离开的时候，一群群的也门妇女翻山越岭赶到了歌舞团的住地。当她们知道歌舞团演出已经结束并即将离开时，都感到非常惋惜，她们激动地拉住中国女演员的手，依依不舍。人越聚越多，可是，服装和道具已经装车，出发的时间已经到了。怎么办？难道就让她们失望而归吗？不！不能。毛主席的为人民服务的教导激励着歌舞团全体成员。团部当即决定：推迟出发，就地演出。歌舞团的住地顿时变成了为也门妇女演出的场所。许多也门妇女，感动得流泪，摘掉面纱，拉住中国女演员的手，热情地说：“世界上最好的人呵，留下吧，你们留下吧！”“我们舍不得你们走！”
    在从伊卜城去塔伊兹的路上，歌舞团经过一座高山时，为聚集在山坡上的当地居民演出。山民们感动得情不自禁地和演员们共同跳起也门的民间舞蹈，宁静的山坡上顿时出现了中、也人民友谊大联欢的欢乐气氛。演出结束时，一位也门朋友迅速地爬上一个山头，发自内心地放声高喊：“中国兄弟再见啦！”“也中人民友谊万岁！”汽车走远了，那声音还在山谷里回荡着。
    照毛主席的教导办事
    歌舞团的演员们每到一处，都以普通劳动者的身份自己装卸舞台，搬运道具；演出结束后，又把演出场地打扫得干干净净。在也门港口荷台达，遇到一场倾盆大雨，全团同志一起动手，冒雨卸车、装台。许多也门朋友第一次看到这种动人的场面，深受感动，有的自动同歌舞团团员一起劳动。一个帮助打扫舞台的也门老人激动地说：“我从来没有见过艺术家像你们这样热爱劳动的，你们是艺术家，又是工人。”
    在旅馆，演员们自己打扫房间，还下伙房帮助服务员洗刷碗碟。人们开始是用迷惑和惊讶的眼光注视着他们，随后便是赞不绝口。叙利亚一位厨师说：“你们都是品德高尚的人，只有你们中国艺术家才尊重我们，同我们一起劳动。”叙利亚一位陪同中国歌舞团的人说：“整个大马士革都在赞扬你们是世界上最有道德的人，因为你们是按照毛主席的教导办事的。”
    毛泽东思想的光辉
    歌舞团的演员尽管演出十分紧张，但在百忙中，他们都坚持学习毛主席著作，从中得到鼓舞和力量。
    当帝国主义进行捣乱的时候，当演出中碰到困难的时候，或者是工作中有了问题的时候，他们就翻开《毛主席语录》，聚精会神地学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导。在赞比亚访问二十天，演出二十场，并且常常是一天换一个地方。但是，饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席著作不可不读。他们以只争朝夕的精神，读毛主席的书。在演出开始前几分钟，在汽车上，在候机室里，在新到旅馆等待分配房间的时候，在排练休息的间隙，在深夜演出后的演评会上……，到处都有人在活学活用毛主席著作，到处都有人在认真地思考和热烈地讨论。
    合唱队的同志，坚持每天晚上演出后，集体学习毛主席语录。他们说，身体疲倦点不要紧，可怕的是思想上疲倦。只有学了毛主席的著作，思想上才能永远年轻，永不疲倦。
    在也门的荷台达，炎热使化妆都难以进行，汗水一次又一次地冲走了脸上的油彩，出生在北方的同志，从来没有经历过这样的酷热，呼吸都感到困难。这时，正准备演出《石油工人凯歌》，同志们想起赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团给中国制造的困难，心里燃烧起无比的怒火。节目一定要演好，一定要表现出中国人民无坚不摧、无攻不克的伟大气魄！他们翻开《毛主席语录》，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这十七个金光闪闪的大字，给了他们无穷的力量和鼓舞。气温再高，也高不过用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命文艺战士的决心，同志们战胜了酷热，演出取得了完全的成功。
    为了表示对巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的支持，歌舞团在去加沙地区访问前两天，突击创作和排练了一个舞蹈《我们一定要返回家园》。夜深十二点了，排练还在继续进行。他们打开《毛主席语录》，高声朗读“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”同志们想到自己是在为支持巴勒斯坦人民斗争而工作，就产生了无比的力量。在大家的努力下，短短的两天，终于产生了这个象征着中国和巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝国主义的战斗友谊的歌舞。在加沙演出时，许多人感动得流了眼泪，他们说：“你们是真正支持我们的，你们的节目最真挚地表达了我们巴勒斯坦人民的心愿。”　　　　　　　　　　　·新华社记者·（附图片）
