Workers at the Weifang Flour Mill in Weifang City, Shandong, have successfully developed a high-speed dual-purpose grinding and crushing machine by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and with a spirit of daring to think and daring to innovate. The machine has already been put into mass production.

Using this dual-purpose grinding and crushing machine can replace one flour mill and one feed crusher, meeting the needs of over a hundred households for flour milling and livestock feed processing. It can process 200 jin (100 kilograms) of wheat per hour, or 300 jin (150 kilograms) of corn, or 600 jin (300 kilograms) of sweet potato vines.

    潍坊制成磨粉粉碎两用机
    山东潍坊市潍坊磨粉厂职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以敢想、敢创的革命精神，试制成功一台全高速的磨粉和粉碎两用机，并已投入成批生产。
    使用这样一台磨粉和粉碎两用机，可以代替一台磨粉机和一台饲料粉碎机，满足一百多户社员磨粉和牲畜饲料加工的需要，每小时可以加工小麦二百斤，或玉米三百斤、甘薯蔓六百斤。
