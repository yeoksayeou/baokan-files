With Mao Zedong Thought, mountains bow and rivers yield. The masses of Jiyuan County in Henan Province, by studying and applying the "Three Articles," have achieved a great victory in water conservancy construction. According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Zhengzhou, the masses of Jiyuan County have taken the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles. After suffering a significant reduction in production due to a severe drought last year, they have, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, hacked through mountains to build canals. They have achieved a great victory in water conservancy construction in mountainous areas, ensuring that this year, despite the drought, the county's grain and cotton production has increased significantly. The masses have deeply felt that using Mao Zedong Thought to hack through mountains makes them bow, and to battle rivers makes them yield, and to cultivate land makes it increase production.

Jiyuan County is located in the northwestern part of Henan Province in the Taihang Mountains. The mountains mentioned in the story of Yu Gong moving mountains are within this county. The mountainous area accounts for more than 80% of the county's total area. The mountains are high and water is scarce, with droughts occurring nine out of ten years. To change this situation, after liberation, especially since the cooperative movement, the people of Jiyuan have built reservoirs, dug wells and canals, and excavated ponds and pits, developing agricultural production. However, most of these projects are small-scale water storage projects that rely on rainwater and cannot fundamentally solve the problem of drought in the mountainous areas. In 1965, a severe drought caused a significant reduction in agricultural production.

In the face of drought and reduced production, with relatively poor material conditions, how can we quickly and efficiently carry out agricultural infrastructure construction? This county relies on the great Mao Zedong Thought and the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

From the beginning of the water conservancy construction, this county, following the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, organized production teams and construction workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on studying and applying them in every aspect. Practice has proven that as long as people listen to Chairman Mao, the mountains and rivers will listen to people. No matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought, nothing is difficult; no matter how lacking, following Chairman Mao's teachings and taking the road of self-reliance, nothing is lacking.

The Jin-Shen-Mang Canal (using water from the Shen River to irrigate the Mang River) is a key project to change the water conservancy situation in Jiyuan County. Once completed, it can irrigate 400,000 mu of mountainous highlands in Jiyuan County and Meng County. This project's stone canal is built on the steep slopes of the Taihang Mountains. The first phase of the project is 61 li long, with the canal above towering peaks and below deep ravines, making construction extremely difficult. The canal needs to pass through the Hongtan area, which is piled with 400 to 500 meters of scattered rocks. Locals call this area "Gaoshi Luan," saying, "The rocks here are connected, one falls and a thousand follow." When the Chengliu Commune's Nandu Brigade took on the task of building this dangerous section of the canal, some people were intimidated by the scattered rocks. Brigade Party Secretary Wang Cuijun organized everyone to study "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains" and used Chairman Mao's teachings of "making a firm decision, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" to encourage everyone. He then led a dozen party members, league members, and militia core members up the mountain first. The mountain slope was steep, and they couldn't stand firmly, so they tied ropes around their waists, removed rocks, and cleared the way for full-scale construction. Inspired by them, other workers also climbed the mountain. One hundred fifty workers fought for 200 days, overcoming various difficulties and dangers, and finally built the canal on the large slope.

The ten thousand workers on the Jin-Shen-Mang Canal construction site, with one breath, hacked through 108 mountain peaks, crossed 148 flood gullies, handled 32 scattered rock beaches and dangerous cliffs, dug 21 stone caves, and built 82 bridge and sluice gate structures. They completed the original three-year plan in just seven months, building a 61-li-long magnificent stone canal. Following this, the masses continued to build the 49-li-long second phase of the project according to Chairman Mao's teachings: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Currently, this phase of the project has been completed by more than 70%.

In the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, driven by the construction of the Jin-Shen-Mang Canal, every commune and brigade in this county has built its own canal projects, actively bringing water up the mountains. The six brigades of Dalu, Shangguanzhuang, and others in the Wangwu Commune have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, relying on their own hands, drilling through mountains, building bridges over gullies, leveling peaks, and hacking through cliffs. They have built a 30-li-long winding stone canal on Wangwu Mountain, bringing river water up the high mountains, turning 2,500 mu of mountainous highlands into irrigated fields. Like Wangwu Commune, other communes in the county have also built a large number of water conservancy projects in the past year, including 292 winding canals, 161 mountain tunnels, and more than 1,000 li of total canal length. These winding canals and field canals have connected the 135 small reservoirs and more than 20,000 ponds and pits in the county like "red threads stringing pearls," achieving the goal of combining water diversion and storage. Although this county encountered another severe drought this summer, the drought-affected farmland was timely irrigated, and the crops grew well. From the current harvesting situation, the county's total grain production and average cotton yield per mu will increase by more than 10% and one fold respectively compared to the highest historical production year.

### 有了毛泽东思想，开山山低头，战河河让路  济源县广大社员活学活用“老三篇”在水利建设战线上打了一个大胜仗

    有了毛泽东思想，开山山低头，战河河让路
    济源县广大社员活学活用“老三篇”在水利建设战线上打了一个大胜仗
    据新华社郑州电　河南省济源县广大公社社员，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，在去年大旱减产之后，用愚公移山的精神劈山修渠，在山区水利建设上打了一个大胜仗，保证今年全县在干旱的情况下，粮棉大幅度增产。社员们深有体会地说：用毛泽东思想去开山山低头，战河河让路，种地地增产。
    济源县位于河南省西北部的太行山区。愚公移山故事中所说的王屋山，即在这个县境内。山岭面积占全县总面积百分之八十以上。山高水缺，十年九旱。为了改变这种状况，解放以后，特别是农业合作化以来，济源人民兴修水库，打井修渠，打塘挖窖，发展了农业生产。但是，这些工程大多是靠雨蓄水的小型工程，不能从根本上解决山区的干旱问题。一九六五年遇到大旱，就造成了农业减产。
    在遭旱减产、物质基础较差的情况下，靠什么来多快好省地进行农田基本建设？这个县靠的是伟大的毛泽东思想，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。
    兴修水利一开始，这个县就根据林彪同志的指示，组织各生产队和工地民工，活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，坚持时时、事事、处处活学活用毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。实践证明，只要人听毛主席的话，山水就会听人的话。千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就什么也不难；千缺万缺，按照毛主席的教导走自力更生的道路，就什么也不缺。
    引沁济蟒渠（即用沁河水接济蟒河）是改变济源县水利面貌的一项骨干工程，全部完工后，可灌溉本县和孟县四十万亩山岭高地。这项工程的大石渠，修建在险峻的太行山腰。第一期工程长六十一里，石渠上依插天高峰，下临激流深潭，修建十分困难。渠道要经过的鸿滩堆积着四五百米高的乱石。当地群众把这里叫做“高石乱”，说“这里的石头是亲连亲，一块下去万块跟”。承留公社南杜等大队承担这一险工地段的修渠任务时，有的人被乱石吓住了。大队党支部副书记王翠琨就组织大家学习《愚公移山》，用毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导来鼓励大家。接着，他带着十几个党员、团员和基干民兵，最先上了山。山势陡，站不住脚，他们便用绳子系着腰，撬石除险，为全面施工开辟工作面。在他们的带动下，其他的民工也纷纷上了山。一百五十名民工，大战二百天，排除了各种艰难险阻，终于在大塌坡上把渠修成。
    引沁济蟒渠工地的万名民工就是这样，一鼓作气劈掉了一百零八个山头，跨越了一百四十八条洪沟，处理了三十二处乱石滩和艰险的陡崖，开凿了二十一个石洞，修建了八十二处桥闸建筑物。仅用七个月时间就完成了原计划三年的任务，修成了六十一里长的雄伟壮丽的大石渠。接着，广大民工又遵照毛主席的教导：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”，继续修建全长四十九里的第二期工程。目前这期工程已完成百分之七十以上。
    在活学活用毛主席著作的运动中，在修建引沁济蟒渠的带动下，这个县社社队队都办起了自己的渠道工程，大搞引水上山。王屋公社的大路、上官庄等六个大队，发扬愚公移山的革命精神，依靠自己的双手，逢山凿洞，遇沟架桥，削山头，劈陡崖，在王屋山上修建一条三十里长的盘山石渠，把河水引上高山，使二千五百亩山岭高地变成水浇田。和王屋公社一样，全县其他各个公社，一年来也修建了大量的水利工程，其中盘山渠道达二百九十二条，穿山凿洞一百六十一处，渠道的总长一千多里，这些盘山渠道和田间渠道，把全县一百三十五座小型水库和两万多个坑塘池窖，像“红线串珍珠”一样地串连起来，达到了以引增蓄、引蓄结合的目的。今年夏季这个县虽然又遇到大旱，但由于受旱农田及时得到灌溉，庄稼长得很好。从目前收打情况看，全县粮食总产量和棉花平均亩产量，将分别比历史上最高年产量增产一成多和一倍左右。
