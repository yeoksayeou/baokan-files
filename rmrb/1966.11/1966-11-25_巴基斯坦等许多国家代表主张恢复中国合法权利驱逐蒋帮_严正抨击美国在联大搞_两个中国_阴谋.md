Pakistan and many other countries' representatives advocate for the restoration of China's legitimate rights and the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique

Severely criticize the U.S. for plotting a "Two Chinas" scheme at the UN General Assembly

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 24, New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its debate on the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations on November 22 and 23. During these two days of meetings, many countries' representatives continued to speak, supporting the restoration of China's legitimate rights, demanding the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and expressing opposition to U.S. imperialism's plot to create a "Two Chinas" scheme.

Pakistan's representative, Ali, emphasized in his speech on November 22 that the Government of the People's Republic of China "represents the Chinese people, which is beyond doubt." He said that if one does not see the issue this way, it is completely avoiding reality. The People's Republic of China has gained widespread international recognition and has signed many highly important international agreements. From any objective evaluation, China's stance in these agreements has shown the characteristics of a great and talented nation, and its stance is upright and magnanimous.

Pakistan's representative then severely exposed and refuted the various schemes adopted by U.S. imperialism to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. He emphasized that the so-called "Two Chinas" proposition is unacceptable. He also expressed opposition to the U.S.-proposed "important question" motion, saying that because what is before the General Assembly is the issue of restoring China's legitimate representative rights, not the issue of "admitting" new member states, there is no need, as the U.S. suggests, for a two-thirds majority to decide this issue.

He also pointed out that the motion proposed by Italy and five other countries to establish a "committee" to "study" the so-called "Chinese representation issue" is "another strategic maneuver aimed at delaying the correct course of action." He stressed, "The facts now clearly prove that the idea that not giving China representation rights will force it to change its policy and accept some humiliating position is merely an illusion."

The representatives of Afghanistan and France also expressed support for the restoration of China's legitimate rights during the November 22 meeting.

Afghanistan's representative, A. Majid, emphasized that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the "sole legitimate government of China."

France's representative, Sedou, stated that France would vote in favor of the motion by Albania and eleven other countries to restore China's legitimate rights and expel the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He also expressed opposition to the "Two Chinas" solution plotted by the U.S. and the U.S.-proposed "important question" motion.

On November 23, Algeria's representative, Bouatoura, spoke, focusing on exposing the "Two Chinas" plot. He pointed out that some countries insist on having the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique act as China's representatives in the United Nations or advocate the existence of "Two Chinas," but "the fact is that China is an indivisible whole." He said, "This is a major political factor that must be considered at present, and all other actions, whose purpose is not to genuinely solve the problem, are aimed at maintaining the status quo." He expressed disagreement with the U.S.-proposed "important question" motion.

Algeria's representative also exposed that the motion by Italy and other countries is an attempt to "pave the way for the myth of accepting two Chinas."

Romania's representative, Malitza, reaffirmed Romania's position of supporting the restoration of China's legitimate rights in his speech. In refuting the fallacy of "Two Chinas," he solemnly pointed out, "There are not two Chinas, but one China, the People's Republic of China." He pointed out that the essence of the "Two Chinas" proposal is to have the Chinese government accept a foreign occupation of part of China's territory—Taiwan. Therefore, "such a proposal is unacceptable," and advocating such a stance "means setting obstacles to genuinely solving the (Chinese representation) issue."

Romania's representative also praised the great achievements of New China, saying, "One of the most prominent events in contemporary changes is that the Chinese people have gained their complete independence and united the strength of 700 million people into a unified creative force."

Zambia's representative, Mwamba, also spoke at the November 23 meeting, expressing support for the motion to restore China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and expel the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He pointed out that isolating the People's Republic of China and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique are both wrong. He also expressed that he could not accept the motion by Italy and other countries.

    巴基斯坦等许多国家代表主张恢复中国合法权利驱逐蒋帮
    严正抨击美国在联大搞“两个中国”阴谋
    据新华社二十四日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会二十二日、二十三日继续辩论关于恢复中国在联合国的合法权利问题。在这两天的会议上，继续有许多国家的代表发言，支持恢复中国的合法权利，要求驱逐蒋介石分子，并且表示反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    巴基斯坦代表阿里在二十二日的会上发言时强调指出，中华人民共和国政府“代表中国人民，这是丝毫无可怀疑的”。他说，如果不这样看问题，那就是完完全全地回避现实。中华人民共和国获得了国际上广泛的承认，它签订了许多具有头等重要性的国际协定。就任何客观的评价来说，中国在这些协议中所采取的态度都表现了作为一个伟大而天才的民族的特点，它采取的态度是光明正大和宽宏大度的。
    巴基斯坦代表接着严正揭露和驳斥了美帝国主义为了阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法权利而采取的种种阴谋手法。他强调指出，所谓“两个中国”的主张是不能接受的。他还表示反对美国提出的所谓“重要问题”的提案，他说，因为摆在大会面前的只是恢复中国的合法代表权的问题，而不是“接纳”新会员国的问题，因此根本无需如美国所建议的那样，要由三分之二的多数来决定这个问题。
    他还指出，由意大利等六国出面提出的关于成立一个“委员会”来“研究”所谓“中国代表权问题”的提案，“是目的在于拖延正确的作法的另一种战略”。他强调说：“事实现在肯定地证明了，认为不让中国得到代表权将强迫它改变政策和接受某种屈辱地位，那只不过是一种幻想。”
    在二十二日会上发言的阿富汗代表和法国代表也都表示支持恢复中国的合法权利。
    阿富汗代表阿·麦吉德强调指出：中华人民共和国政府是“中国的唯一合法政府”。
    法国代表赛杜表示，法国将投票赞成阿尔巴尼亚等十一国关于恢复中国合法权利、驱逐蒋介石分子的提案。他还表示反对美国策划的“两个中国”的解决办法以及美国提出的所谓“重要问题”提案。
    二十三日，阿尔及利亚代表布阿图拉发言着重揭露了“两个中国”的阴谋。他指出，有些国家坚持要以蒋介石集团的“代表”充作中国在联合国组织中的代表，或者主张存在“两个中国”，但是，“事实是，中国是不可分割的一个整体”。他说，这就是当前所必须考虑的一个重大政治因素，除此之外的所有做法，“其目的不是真正要解决问题，而是要维持现状。”他表示不同意美国的所谓“重要问题”的提案。
    阿尔及利亚代表还揭露说，意大利等国的提案是企图“为接受两个中国的神话铺平道路”。
    罗马尼亚代表马利查在发言中重申了罗马尼亚支持恢复中国合法权利的立场。他在驳斥“两个中国”的谬论时严正指出：“不存在两个中国，只存在一个中国，就是中华人民共和国”，他指出，“两个中国”这个“建议的实质是让中国政府接受一个外国对中国领土的一部分——台湾的占领”，因此，“这种建议是无法接受的”，鼓吹这种主张就“意味着为真正解决（中国代表权问题）设置障碍”。
    罗马尼亚代表还赞扬了新中国所取得的巨大成就，他说：“当代变化中最突出的事件之一就是，中国人民取得了自己的完全独立，把七亿人民的精力联合成了一个统一的创造力量。”
    赞比亚代表姆温巴也在二十三日的会上发言，表示支持关于恢复中国在联合国的合法权利和驱逐蒋介石分子的提案。他指出，孤立中华人民共和国和支持蒋介石集团都是错误的。他还表示不能接受意大利等国的提案。
