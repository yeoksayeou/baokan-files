	"With great joy, I learned that on October 27, 1966, China conducted a missile nuclear weapons test and achieved complete success. On behalf of the Lao people, the Lao Patriotic Front, and in my personal capacity, I extend my warmest congratulations to Your Excellency, and through Your Excellency to the Government of the People's Republic of China, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the great seven hundred million Chinese people.

	The Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front highly evaluate China's possession of nuclear weapons, especially this successful missile nuclear weapons test, which shows that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people's modern science and technology are making unprecedented rapid progress. This new achievement not only further strengthens the national defense of the People's Republic of China and the strength of the socialist camp, but also powerfully strikes at the imperialist and reactionary forces led by U.S. imperialism, and at the same time, it is a great encouragement to the liberation struggles of all peoples and the cause of world peace. The Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front are extremely happy about the brilliant victory achieved by the Chinese people and regard it as a powerful encouragement to our determination to defeat the U.S. imperialist invaders and their lackey groups.

	Please convey our sincere greetings to the brave soldiers, scientific and technological workers, workers, and staff who participated in this successful test. We sincerely wish for the brotherly Chinese people to achieve even greater new victories. May the friendship and combat unity between the Lao people and the Chinese people last forever."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao received a congratulatory letter from Nguyen Minh Phuong, Acting Head of the Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in China, warmly congratulating our country's successful launch of missile nuclear weapons test.

	The congratulatory letter states: The successful test of China's missile nuclear weapons has a great impact on strengthening the national defense of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, it is a tremendous encouragement to the Vietnamese people in the South, who are bravely fighting against the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism, and to the people of all nations who are striving for national liberation and defending world peace. It is a victory under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao. The letter wishes the Chinese People's Liberation Army more new victories in its national defense modernization, and to make even greater contributions to opposing imperialism led by the United States and defending world peace.
