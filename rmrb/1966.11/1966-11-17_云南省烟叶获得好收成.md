Yunnan Province, a renowned tobacco-producing region in China, has seen a significant increase in tobacco production this year. According to relevant departments, the total tobacco leaf yield in the province has increased by about 10% compared to last year, and the yield per unit area has increased by more than 20% compared to last year.

This year's bumper tobacco harvest in Yunnan Province is the result of the broad masses of commune members holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and engaging in a tenacious struggle against natural disasters such as droughts and floods. Currently, commune members across the province are actively selling flue-cured tobacco to the state. The total procurement volume in the province has increased compared to the same period last year. Famous tobacco-producing areas such as Jiangchuan and Yuxi have already exceeded their procurement targets.

    云南省烟叶获得好收成
    我国著名烤烟产区的云南省，今年烟草获得大幅度增产。据有关部门统计，全省烟叶的总产量比去年增加一成左右，单位面积产量比去年提高二成以上。
    今年云南省烟叶获得好收成，是广大社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同旱、涝等自然灾害进行顽强斗争的结果。目前，各地社员正在积极地向国家出售烤烟，全省收购量比去年同期有所增长。江川、玉溪等著名烤烟产区已超额完成了收购计划。
