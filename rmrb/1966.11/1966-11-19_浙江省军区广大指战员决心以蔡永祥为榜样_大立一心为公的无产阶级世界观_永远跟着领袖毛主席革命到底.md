The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Zhejiang Military Region have decided to take Cai Yongxiang as an example, to thoroughly repudiate the bourgeois worldview, to firmly establish a selfless proletarian worldview, and to follow Chairman Mao Zedong in revolution to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 18th: The various units under the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhejiang Military Region are extensively and deeply carrying out the activities of propagating and learning from Cai Yongxiang. The broad masses of soldiers and officers have decided to take Cai Yongxiang as an example, to thoroughly repudiate the bourgeois worldview, to firmly establish a selfless proletarian worldview, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

In recent days, the various units under the Zhejiang Military Region, from the headquarters to the platoons, everywhere is a lively scene of speaking about the hero, singing about the hero, writing about the hero, and learning from the hero. The soldiers and officers of the platoon where Cai Yongxiang served before his heroic sacrifice held a night discussion after his martyrdom. The "Model Joint Defense Unit of Soldiers and Civilians" stationed on an island, the unit stationed on an island in East Zhejiang, which was formerly the "Railway Guerrilla Unit," and a certain communications platoon, organized a propaganda team or prepared cultural performances, and went deep into the platoons and the people's communes where they were stationed to propagate Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds.

Through learning from Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds, the soldiers and officers have a deeper understanding of the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. They say, Cai Yongxiang's selfless communist spirit is the result of being nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the result of thoroughly studying and applying the "Three Articles" to transform the soul. To learn from Cai Yongxiang, one must, like him, use the "Three Articles" as a weapon, to thoroughly eliminate the "self" and to firmly establish the "public." Under the inspiration of the hero, the broad masses of soldiers and officers love the "Three Articles" even more, and are determined to take the "Three Articles" as a motto to study. Many units have launched activities to recite the "Three Articles" and to copy the "Three Articles" word by word. The soldiers' beds, the artillerymen's positions, the communications soldiers' telephones, the medics' medical bags, the sentries' guard posts, everywhere has the sayings from the "Three Articles." The medical staff of a certain military hospital not only study and apply Chairman Mao's works well themselves, but also go out to enthusiastically help the masses learn. Recently, they have donated tens of thousands of copies of Chairman Mao's works to the poor and lower-middle peasants in the nearby areas where they are stationed.

Cai Yongxiang's deeds have also shaken many leading cadres, who think, Cai Yongxiang is only eighteen years old, and has only been in the army for eight months, why has he grown so fast? The fundamental reason is that he, with the spirit of "seizing the day," eagerly studies Chairman Mao's works, repudiates the self and establishes the public, and firmly grasps the transformation of the worldview. Some leading cadres sigh, "The level of ideological awakening does not depend on the length of one's tenure, the height of one's position, or the size of one's age. The fundamental thing is whether one uses Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out a thorough revolution in the depths of one's soul." Li Yanzhou, a three-level people's hero from East China and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, after reviewing his twenty-seven years of revolutionary experience, said: "My whole life has been guided by Mao Zedong Thought. After learning from Cai Yongxiang's deeds, and thinking about the countless revolutionary martyrs of the war years, in the future, I will have only one mind: to firmly maintain the late-style of a proletarian warrior, to eagerly study and apply the 'Three Articles,' and to fight to the end with any selfish thoughts that arise." Many leading cadres, after learning from Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds, also find their shortcomings, make plans, and are determined to learn from the young comrades, to catch up with the young comrades, to eagerly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to transform their thoughts, and to follow Chairman Mao in revolution to the end.

    浙江省军区广大指战员决心以蔡永祥为榜样
    大立一心为公的无产阶级世界观
    永远跟着领袖毛主席革命到底
    据新华社杭州十八日电　中国人民解放军浙江省军区所属各部队，正在广泛深入地开展宣传和学习蔡永祥的活动。广大指战员决心以蔡永祥为榜样，大破资产阶级世界观，大立一心为公的无产阶级世界观，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段。
    连日来，浙江省军区所属各部队，从机关到连队，到处都是一片大讲英雄、大唱英雄、大写英雄、大学英雄的热烈景象。蔡永祥生前所在连队指战员在蔡永祥英勇牺牲以后，连夜举行了座谈。驻守海岛的某部“军民联防模范连”，前身是“铁道游击队”的驻浙东某岛部队，某部通讯连，组织宣传队，或者编排了文艺节目，深入到连队和驻地人民公社，宣传蔡永祥的英雄事迹。
    通过学习蔡永祥的英雄事迹，指战员更加深刻地认识到毛泽东思想无比强大的威力。他们说，蔡永祥一心为公的共产主义精神，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果，是狠学狠用“老三篇”，改造灵魂的结果。学习蔡永祥就要像他那样以“老三篇”为武器，大灭特灭一个“私”字，大立特立一个“公”字。在英雄的鼓舞下，广大指战员更加热爱“老三篇”，决心把
  “老三篇”当作座右铭来学。许多部队开展了背诵“老三篇”、逐字抄录“老三篇”的活动。战士的床头，炮兵的阵地，通信兵的电话机，卫生员的医药包，哨兵的岗棚，处处都有“老三篇”的语录。某军医院医务人员不仅自己学好用好毛主席著作，还走出门去，热情帮助人民群众学习。最近，他们已向驻地附近的贫下中农捐送了上万册毛主席著作。
    蔡永祥的事迹也震动了许多领导干部，他们认为，蔡永祥只有十八岁，入伍才八个月，为什么成长得这么快呢？根本的原因就在于他用“只争朝夕”的精神，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，破私立公，踏踏实实狠抓世界观的改造。有的领导干部感慨地说：“思想觉悟的高低，并不决定于资历的长短，职务的高低，年龄的大小，根本的一条，就是要看他是不是用毛泽东思想作武器，在灵魂深处狠闹革命。”华东三级人民英雄、学习毛主席著作积极分子李延洲，回顾自己参加革命二十七年的经历以后，说：“我的上半辈子全靠毛泽东思想的指引走过来了。学了蔡永祥的事迹，再想想战争年代无数革命先烈，今后只有一个心眼：坚决保持无产阶级战士的晚节，勤学狠用‘老三篇’，私心杂念一露头，我就同它狠拚狠斗。”许多领导干部学了蔡永祥的英雄事迹之后，还找差距，订计划，决心学小将，赶小将，狠学狠用毛主席著作，改造思想，永远跟着毛主席革命到底。
