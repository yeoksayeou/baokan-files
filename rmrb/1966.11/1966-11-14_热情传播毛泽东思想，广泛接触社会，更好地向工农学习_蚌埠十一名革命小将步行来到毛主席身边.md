This group of railway middle school students formed the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team," walking for forty-four days, covering two thousand miles, to come to Beijing for revolutionary linkage. They deeply felt that walking linkage is very good, tempering their thoughts and willpower, and their understanding of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts is more profound than before.

	New China News Agency, November 13th: Eleven children of railway workers from Bengbu Railway Middle School in Anhui Province, formed the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team." With the strong desire to throw themselves into the fiery class struggle and among the worker and peasant masses, to consciously reform their thoughts and temper their revolutionary will, they set out from Bengbu in mid-September. In forty-four days, they walked two thousand miles to reach the side of the great leader Chairman Mao. Along the way, they insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, passionately propagating Mao Zedong Thought, widely contacting the masses, and experiencing the revolutionary storms. They saw the great spectacle of mass movements, and their thoughts underwent a great tempering and elevation.

	On November 3rd, these revolutionary youth, along with revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country, saw the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, whom they had been longing for day and night. When they heard Comrade Lin Biao convey Chairman Mao's support for students' walking linkage, they were greatly inspired. They said, "We have only taken the first step on the brilliant road guided by Chairman Mao. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, temper and reform ourselves in the great furnace of the Cultural Revolution, and become revolutionary and battle-ready youth, becoming the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause that Chairman Mao ardently hopes for."

	These eleven revolutionary youth are second-year high school students from Bengbu Railway Middle School, including three female students. Their average age is only eighteen. In this Cultural Revolution that touches the soul of every individual, they realized that the education they received in school is basically bourgeois, seriously detached from reality, from the masses, and from class struggle. If they continued this way, they would only cultivate themselves into hothouse flowers. They said: The so-called "born red" is wrong and contrary to Mao Zedong Thought. Although we are all children of railway workers and grew up under the red flag, if we do not throw ourselves into the great furnace of class struggle for tempering, do not unite with the worker and peasant masses, and do not reform our worldview, we cannot temper ourselves into a hard-boned proletariat, and we cannot become reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	"We want to be the sturdy pines on the mountain, not the hothouse flowers. We do not believe in 'born red,' we must be 'self-consciously red.'" These eleven revolutionary youth spent a few days repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's "The Orientation of the Youth Movement" and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," organizing the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team," walking out of schools and homes, facing wind and rain, and facing difficulties. On September 11th, they set out at dawn along the railway line heading to Beijing.

	The first few days of the march were particularly arduous due to the lack of adaptation. At that time, each person's backpack, along with drums and propaganda materials, weighed an average of over thirty pounds. Walking tens of miles a day, the weather was hot, and sweat soaked their clothes and backpacks. When they were too tired to walk, they would sing loudly the songs composed from Chairman Mao's poems: "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the long march, ten thousand waters and mountains are but trifles"; they would collectively read Chairman Mao's quotations: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," encouraging each other's fighting spirit. During the march, sometimes they could not eat on time, walking with empty stomachs. They encouraged themselves with the heroic deeds of the old Red Army eating grass roots and tree bark during the Long March. They said, going hungry is a good opportunity to experience the difficulties of the revolutionary cause and the oppression of the old society by the classes. The predecessors endured hunger for our sake today; our self-tempering today is for building a more beautiful country and letting more people in the world not go hungry. Thinking of these, everyone walked with more vigor.

	Along the way, many station managers provided them with tickets and let them board the train, but they all politely declined. On October 17th, they heard in Tianjin that Chairman Mao would meet with the Red Guards the next day and were eager to fly to Chairman Mao's side. Some people advised them to first take the train to Beijing to see Chairman Mao and then make up for this section of the journey. But they thought that the Long March mission had not been completed, and if they did not march to the end, it would show that their revolutionary will was not strong enough. Therefore, everyone decided: "We must walk the entire journey to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!" They finally arrived in Beijing on foot on October 24th.

	The revolutionary youth of the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team" reflected on the forty-four days of walking linkage and deeply felt that walking linkage is very good, tempering their thoughts and willpower, learning a lot of knowledge that cannot be learned from books, and experiencing many things that they only knew from books but had never personally experienced. Especially their understanding of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts is more profound than ever before.

	At the beginning of the march, they crossed the battlefield of the Huaihai Campaign. When passing by the majestic Huaihai Campaign Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Tower in Xuzhou, everyone could not suppress their inner excitement and vowed to advance along the path where revolutionary martyrs had shed their blood. On the day they arrived at Weishan Lake, the youth had not eaten lunch, their stomachs were hungry, and their legs were sore, but when they recalled the guerrilla fighters who were active in the enemy's heart and dealt a fatal blow to the enemy, everyone unconsciously quickened their pace. In the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery at the foot of Mount Tai, they reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai," and vowed to dedicate their lives to the people's liberation cause, which is heavier than Mount Tai.

	The youth walked two thousand miles on foot, seeing with their own eyes the vast land of their motherland under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, has undergone profound historical changes. They said, ironclad facts show that only under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, our socialist motherland can prosper day by day and ensure it will never change color. There are still a few people in society who oppose Mao Zedong Thought and attempt to lead our country down the capitalist road, which is absolutely impossible! They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defend to the death the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

	Walking linkage allowed the youth to widely contact worker and peasant masses and learn a lot from them. They said, learning from workers and peasants is to learn their unlimited loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, and their excellent qualities of diligence, bravery, and selflessness. During the march, they received warm care and help from workers and peasants in their lives and thoughts. Many families of railway workers along the railway line washed their clothes and mended their socks, taking buttons from their own clothes and sewing them onto the youth's clothes. When they felt tired walking, they often received letters from worker comrades thrown from speeding trains, filled with heroic words, encouraging them to persist to the final victory. At the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, they visited the famous "Mao Zedong" locomotive nationwide and had a discussion with the crew members. The acting locomotive captain treated them as workers coming to take over, telling them the history of the locomotive and the family history. The youth saw on this locomotive, the locomotive's head hung a shining portrait of Chairman Mao, and the locomotive was filled with neatly written quotations from Chairman Mao. The crew members affectionately told them that the achievements of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive in the past twenty years were all due to the result of having Mao Zedong Thought armed in their minds. They encouraged the youth to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and always be the locomotive of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The words of the worker comrades made the youth even more determined: read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, do revolution for a lifetime; study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" for a lifetime, reform thoughts for a lifetime, and be a reliable successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The revolutionary youth of the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team" believe that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought. They said: We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is our duty. With their boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought, they insisted on propagating Mao Zedong Thought activities wherever they went. During the forty-four days of the march, they performed over one hundred and twenty cultural performances in more than one hundred railway stations and villages along the line; they also distributed a large number of booklets with the "Sixteen Points" and editorials from the People's Daily, as well as pamphlets for destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News," which were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses.

    蚌埠十一名革命小将步行来到毛主席身边

    千里，来京进行革命串连。他们深深体会到步行串连好得很，炼红了思想，磨炼了意志，对毛主席光辉思想的理解，比过去更深刻了。
    新华社十三日讯　安徽省蚌埠铁路中学十一个铁路工人子女组成的“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”，怀着投身到火热的阶级斗争中去，投身到工农群众中去，自觉改造思想、磨炼革命意志的强烈愿望，于九月中旬从蚌埠出发，以四十四天时间，步行两千里，来到伟大领袖毛主席的身边。一路上，他们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，广泛地接触了群众，接触了社会，经受了革命的风雨，见到了群众运动的大世面，思想上得到了一次大锻炼，大提高。
    十一月三日，这批革命小将同来自全国各地的革命师生和红卫兵一起，见到了日夜思念的最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。当他们听到林彪同志转达毛主席支持同学们步行串连的讲话时，万分鼓舞。他们说，我们只是在毛主席指引的光辉大道上走了万里长征的第一步。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在文化大革命的大熔炉里，锻炼自己，改造自己，使自己成为革命化战斗化的青年，成为毛主席所殷切期望的无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
    这十一名革命小将是蚌埠铁路中学高中二年级的学生，其中有三个女同学。他们的平均年龄只有十八岁。在这场触及每个人灵魂的文化大革命中，他们认识到，由于在学校里接受的教育基本上还是资产阶级的那一套，严重地脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离阶级斗争，这样下去，只能把自己培养成为温室里的花朵。他们说：所谓“自来红”的说法，是错误的，是违反毛泽东思想的。我们虽然都是铁路工人的后代，是在红旗下长大的青年，但是，如果不投身到阶级斗争的大熔炉里去锻炼，不同工农群众结合，不改造世界观，就不能炼就一身工人阶级硬骨头，就不能成为可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
      “我们要做高山上的劲松，不做温室里的花朵。我们不信‘自来红’，定要‘自觉红’。”这十一个革命小将用几天时间反复学习毛主席的《青年运动的方向》和“老三篇”，组织了一支“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”，走出学校和家庭，迎着风雨，迎着困难，于九月十一日黎明沿着通向北京的铁路线徒步北上。
    行军的头几天，因为不适应，大家感到特别艰苦。当时，每人背上的背包，加上锣鼓和宣传材料，平均负重三十多斤。一天走几十里路，天气又热，汗水浸透了他们的衣服和背包，累得走不动了，大家就放声高唱用毛主席的诗词谱成的歌曲：“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”；集体朗读毛主席的语录“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，互相鼓舞斗志。行军途中，有时不能按时吃饭，饿着肚子走路，大家就以当年长征路上的老红军吃草根、树皮，坚持革命斗争的英雄事迹鼓励自己。他们说，饿一饿，正是体会革命事业的艰难，体会旧社会阶级压迫的好机会。前辈挨饿是为了我们今天不挨饿；我们今天的自我锻炼，是为了建设更美好的祖国，和让世界上更多的人不挨饿。想到这些，大家就越走越有劲。
    沿途，许多车站负责人给他们办好了车票，让他们上车，他们都婉言谢绝了。十月十七日，他们在天津听说第二天毛主席要接见红卫兵，恨不得马上飞到毛主席的身边。有些人劝他们先坐车到北京去见毛主席，回头再补上这一段路。但他们想到长征任务还没有完成，如果不长征到底，说明革命意志还不够坚强。于是，大家决定：“一定要全程走到北京，去见毛主席！”他们终于在十月二十四日徒步到达了北京。
    “毛泽东思想长征宣传队”的革命小将们在回顾这四十四天步行串连的体会时，深深感到步行串连好得很，炼红了思想，磨炼了意志，还学到许多书本上学不到的知识，体会到许多过去只从书本上知道而从没有亲身体会过的东西。特别是对毛主席的光辉思想的理解，比过去任何时候都更加深刻了。
    行军开始，他们就横穿过当年淮海战役的战场。在徐州，从雄伟的淮海战役革命烈士纪念塔旁经过的时候，大家都抑制不住内心的激动，暗下决心，一定要沿着革命烈士洒过鲜血的道路前进。到微山湖的那天，小将们没有吃中午饭，肚子饿，腿又痛，但当回忆起当年活跃在敌人心脏、给敌人以致命打击的铁道游击队时，个个不由自主地加快了步伐。在泰山脚下的革命烈士陵园里，他们重温了毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，决心像先烈们那样，把自己的一生献给比泰山还重的人民解放事业。
    小将们徒步行走两千里，一路上，亲眼见到祖国辽阔的土地在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，已经发生了深刻的历史性变化。他们说，铁的事实说明，只有在毛主席的英明领导下，我们社会主义祖国才能一天比一天兴旺，才能保证永不变色。社会上还有那么一小撮人，反对毛泽东思想，企图把我国引向资本主义道路，这万万办不到！他们表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    步行串连，使小将们广泛地接触工农群众，向工人农民学到了许多东西。他们说，我们向工农学习，就是要学习他们对党对毛主席的无限忠诚，学习他们勤劳勇敢、大公无私的优秀品质。行军途中，他们在生活上、思想上受到了工人和农民的热情关怀和帮助。沿铁路线的许多职工家属为他们洗衣服、补袜子，把身上的扣子扯下来钉在他们的衣服上。当他们走路感到吃力的时候，常常收到工人同志们从飞驶的列车上投下来的信，这些信充满了豪言壮语，鼓励他们坚持到最后胜利。在丰台机务段，他们参观了全国闻名的“毛泽东号”机车，和这个机车包乘组的同志们进行座谈。代理司机长把他们当作前来接班的工人一样，给他们讲车史和家史。小将们在这台机车上看到，火车头上悬装着闪闪发光的毛主席画像，机车上到处是书写整齐的毛主席语录。包乘组工人们亲切地告诉他们说，“毛泽东号”机车二十年来取得的成绩，都是由于有了毛泽东思想武装头脑的结果。他们鼓励小将们响应林彪同志的号召，认真学习毛主席著作，永远做活学活用毛主席著作的火车头。工人同志们的这席话，使小将们更加坚定了这样的决心：读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命；学一辈子“老三篇”，改造一辈子思想，当一名真正可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    “毛泽东思想长征宣传队”的革命小将们认为，无产阶级文化大革命，就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。他们说：我们是毛主席的红小兵，宣传毛泽东思想是我们的天职。他们怀着对毛泽东思想的无比热爱，坚持每到一地，就进行宣传毛泽东思想的活动。在四十四天的行军途中，他们在上百个铁路沿线的小站和村镇进行了一百二十多场文艺演出；他们还散发了大批印有十六条和《人民日报》社论等内容的小册子，以及破“四旧”、立“四新”的传单等，受到了广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
