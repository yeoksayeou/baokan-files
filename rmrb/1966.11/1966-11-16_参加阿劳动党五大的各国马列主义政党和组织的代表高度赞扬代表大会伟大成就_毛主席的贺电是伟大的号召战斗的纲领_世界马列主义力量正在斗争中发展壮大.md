Representatives of Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations from various countries who attended the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour highly praised the great achievements of the congress. Mao Zedong's congratulatory message is a great call to action and a program for struggle. The forces of Marxism-Leninism in the world are growing stronger in the struggle.

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Communist Party of New Zealand, the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), the Communist Party of Belgium, the Communist Party of Bolivia, the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile, the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninists), the Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement of France, and the Socialist Revolutionary Party of Lebanon, who were invited to attend the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, recently spoke to Xinhua reporters. They enthusiastically praised the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and highly evaluated Mao Zedong's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour.

	The head of the Indonesian Communist Party delegation, Central Political Bureau member and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee, Yu. Ajitoro, said that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour demonstrated the close unity of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people, and showed the people's love and trust for the party. This congress has great international historical significance. Representatives from five continents of Marxist-Leninists attended and praised it. This shows that the Marxist-Leninist movement in the world has grown stronger and more consolidated in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries. This congress also clearly reflects the fighting unity of Marxist-Leninists around the world.

	He said that Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulatory message to the congress is of great significance not only to Albanian communists but also to the international communist movement.

	Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulatory message correctly expresses the high evaluation of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world for the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the heroic Albanian people. The message is right: People's Albania has become a great socialist beacon in Europe. This message correctly expresses the fighting friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania, based on proletarian internationalism and genuine Marxist-Leninist principles.

	Ajitoro said: The experience of the Indonesian Communist Party and people in the struggle against the brutal white terror of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military dictatorship, and in the true united action against imperialism and modern revisionism helping the fascist military dictatorship, has proven that the call made by Comrade Mao Zedong in the congratulatory message is correct and urgent. This call is: All Marxist-Leninists in the world unite, all revolutionary people in the world unite, overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, and overthrow the reactionaries of various countries.

	The head of the New Zealand Communist Party delegation, National Committee Political Commission member Ray Nunes, said that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour is an event of great domestic and international significance. The congress has fully adhered to the line of resolute and ruthless struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. It has drawn a clear line between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, declaring that there is no middle ground between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism.

	He said that the attendance of many representatives of Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations from various countries at this congress shows that new forces are rising all over the world, determined to fight imperialism and completely break with the revisionists who betray the interests of the working class and the laboring people.

	Nunes said that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour shows that the Albanian Party of Labour and all Marxist-Leninists around the world, together with the Communist Party of China led by the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, are advancing in unity, will end imperialism, and build a new world of socialist family.

	He emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulatory message to the congress deeply embodies the spirit of proletarian internationalism and Marxist-Leninist revolution. The message clearly shows the unity of the Communist Party of China with the Albanian Party of Labour and all revolutionaries. It shows that the Communist Party of China has unlimited trust in the people of various countries, believing that they can defeat imperialism, achieve national liberation, and carry out socialist revolution.

	Nunes said that Mao Zedong's congratulatory message is a call to arms for the people of various countries to unite and advance towards the only correct path of victory, which is the class struggle and national liberation struggle under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. It has given and will continue to give new inspiration to Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries around the world.

	The head of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) delegation, Central Committee member H. E. O'Sullivan, pointed out that China's successful launch of missile nuclear weapons tests, the great success of the revolution, and the achievements of the Red Guards have left the American imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists dumbfounded. Then, the Albanian Party of Labour held its Fifth Congress, with representatives from many countries' communist parties, workers' parties, and Marxist-Leninist organizations attending the congress, which is another great blow to imperialism and modern revisionism.

	He said that the great Mao Zedong is an outstanding Marxist-Leninist of our time, who has made great contributions to the scientific development of Marxism-Leninism. The great Mao Zedong's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour is very profound. We suggest studying it seriously.

	In his speech, O'Sullivan particularly emphasized the issue of building a new type of party based on Mao Zedong Thought. He said that we must strive to build a new type of, genuine Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party. In this regard, we believe that studying Chairman Mao's works, especially "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," is very important, of course, all of Chairman Mao's works are extremely important.

	O'Sullivan criticized the so-called middle-of-the-road fallacy in the international communist movement. He said that there is no middle-of-the-road. You either support Marxism-Leninism and the world revolution, or you oppose it. If you oppose Marxism-Leninism and the world revolution, you are either consciously or unconsciously a counter-revolutionary.

	The head of the Belgian Communist Party delegation, Central Committee Secretary J. Griva, said: Comrade Mao Zedong correctly praised the Albanian Party of Labour and the heroic Albanian people in the congratulatory message, pointing out that the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership are merely "a handful of earth," while socialist Albania is "a towering mountain," thus inspiring all revolutionaries around the world to draw inspiration from the courage and firmness of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people.

	Griva emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the congratulatory message the development, victory, and glorious future of the world revolution, calling on all Marxist-Leninists around the world to unite, all revolutionary people around the world to unite, to overthrow imperialism, to overthrow modern revisionism, to overthrow the reactionaries of various countries, and to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without an exploitative system, thus greatly inspiring all revolutionaries to redouble their efforts and fight.

	The head of the Bolivian Communist Party delegation, Central Secretariat member Oscar Samora, said that this congress is of great historical significance to the Albanian people, and it has also made great contributions to the international communist movement. From this congress, we see that the Marxist-Leninist forces around the world are developing and growing stronger, while modern revisionism is on the decline. We see that the Communist Party of China and the Albanian Party of Labour are respected and loved by Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, while the Soviet Communist Party leadership's attempt to isolate China and Albania in collusion with American imperialism has once again failed.

	In exposing the reactionary "united action" fallacy of the Soviet revisionist clique, he said that the Soviet revisionists accuse Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of not wanting to support the Vietnamese people by not joining their so-called "united action," which is a complete cliché. The Soviet revisionists shout "support Vietnam" and give some material aid on the surface; but this cannot cover up their true purpose of sabotaging the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. Many facts show that the Soviet revisionists have long been colluding with American imperialists in "united action." The Soviet revisionists dream of using the "united action" label to act as the boss of the world revolution, in order to make a deal with the imperialist boss—America—to dominate the world together, which is absolutely deceiving Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people.

	In talking about Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, he said that Chairman Mao's congratulatory message vividly embodies the great Mao Zedong Thought, which is an important document of Marxism-Leninism. This is not only a congratulatory message to the Albanian comrades but also to all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world. We are greatly inspired.

	He said that our task is to make our party and our people learn and master the great Mao Zedong Thought—the contemporary Marxism-Leninism. We believe that when the Bolivian people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will be invincible.

	Samora said that we must work hard to strive for the great call of Comrade Mao Zedong: "All Marxist-Leninists in the world unite, all revolutionary people in the world unite, overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionaries of various countries."

	The head of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile delegation, Central Secretariat member Jorge Diaz, said that the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour will mobilize the Albanian people to achieve greater successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and will further strengthen the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, making new contributions to the world revolution and the defense and development of Marxism-Leninism.

	He said that Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour is a great encouragement and support to all Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary people around the world. It will arouse their revolutionary fighting spirit and, with the ideas of the congratulatory message as a great weapon, strive for new victories.

	He pointed out that our party believes that the experience of the world revolution has proven the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought, which is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism. We are making great efforts to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in our actual struggle. We are firmly convinced that once the people of the world are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely achieve a thorough victory over imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

	The head of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninists) delegation, General Secretary F. Dinocci, said that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour is not only a historic event for the Albanian people who are striving to build socialism but also a historic event for all the people of various countries who are struggling against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries.

	He said that Marxist-Leninists of various countries must resolutely struggle against modern revisionism while struggling against imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries. There is no middle ground and no neutral path between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. Any indecisive and compromising position will be beneficial to the conspiracies of imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism.

	He pointed out that Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour has caused a great upsurge among the Albanian representatives and the representatives of brother parties. This congratulatory message is an important document of the glorious Communist Party of China, which takes Mao Zedong Thought as its guide, and is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism.

	Dinocci said that Chairman Mao's congratulatory message calls People's Albania "a great socialist beacon in Europe," which has greatly boosted the morale of European Marxist-Leninists because they are taking the Albanian Party of Labour as an example to build a resolute and indomitable vanguard of the proletariat against imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and modern revisionism.

	He said that Chairman Mao's congratulatory message points out the path of class struggle in all aspects. The call in the congratulatory message, "All Marxist-Leninists in the world unite, all revolutionary people in the world unite..." is our most basic teaching. Every Marxist-Leninist should use the congratulatory message to enrich his revolutionary ideological consciousness.

	The head of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement of France delegation, Political Bureau member and Secretariat member Ray Cassas, said that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour is a great inspiration to the representatives of various Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations, including our delegation.

	He said that the congratulatory message of Comrade Kang Sheng, read at the congress, which is from Chairman Mao—contemporary Lenin—strongly armed our minds. The statement in the congratulatory message that "the traitors of the revolution are only 'a handful of earth,' while the revolutionary forces are 'a towering mountain,'" clearly draws a line between the new Marxist-Leninist forces and the decaying forces that betray the revolution.

	The head of the Socialist Revolutionary Party of Lebanon delegation, Central Committee Chairman Yu. Mubarak, pointed out that Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour has great international significance and is a very important document. It vividly reflects the fraternal fighting friendship between the Communist Party of China and the Albanian Party of Labour. It shows the genuine unity of Marxist-Leninists on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, in the common struggle against American imperialism and modern revisionism represented by the Soviet leadership.

	He said that for us Lebanese communists, the congratulatory message is a great contribution from the brotherly Communist Party of China and its beloved teacher, our dear Comrade Mao Zedong, to strengthening the struggle against our common enemies—American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. We Lebanese communists regard Chairman Mao's congratulatory message as a program and as the Marxist-Leninist line of struggle in politics, ideology, theory, and organization. Chairman Mao's congratulatory message points out: "The truth of Marxism-Leninism is on our side. The international proletariat is on our side. The oppressed nations and peoples are on our side. More than 90% of the people of the world are on our side. Our friends are all over the world. We are not afraid of isolation, nor will we be isolated. We are invincible. A handful of miserable anti-China and anti-Albania people are doomed to failure." This is the truth!

	Mubarak said that imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries all oppose China and Albania; while all revolutionaries, all Marxist-Leninists, all oppressed peoples and nations, and all upright people in the world stand with China, with the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with Albania and its Party of Labour and Comrade Hoxha.

	He said that the entire progressive humanity, all oppressed and exploited peoples, and all those who truly want to make a revolution under the red flag of Marxism-Leninism, achieve liberation, and strive for the victory of socialism, wholeheartedly welcome Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour.

    参加阿劳动党五大的各国马列主义政党和组织的代表高度赞扬代表大会伟大成就
    毛主席的贺电是伟大的号召战斗的纲领
    世界马列主义力量正在斗争中发展壮大
    新华社地拉那十四日电　应邀参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的印度尼西亚共产党、新西兰共产党、澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）、比利时共产党、玻利维亚共产党、智利革命共产党、意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）、法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）和黎巴嫩社会主义革命党的代表最近向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会圆满成功，并且高度评价毛主席致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电。
    印度尼西亚共产党代表团团长、中央政治局委员、中央副总书记优·阿吉托罗普说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会表明了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的紧密团结，表明了阿尔巴尼亚人民对党的热爱和信任。这次代表大会具有十分伟大的国际历史意义，这次大会有五大洲的马克思列宁主义者参加，并得到他们的赞扬。这表明，世界马克思列宁主义运动在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，得到了壮大和进一步的巩固。这次代表大会也明确体现了世界马克思列宁主义者的战斗团结。
    他说，毛泽东同志致大会的贺电，不仅对阿尔巴尼亚共产党人，而且对国际共产主义运动，都具有伟大的意义。
    毛泽东同志的贺电正确地表达了世界马克思列宁主义者和世界革命人民对恩维尔·霍查同志领导下的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民的高度评价。贺电说得很对：人民的阿尔巴尼亚成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。这份贺电正确地表达了中、阿两党和两国人民建立在无产阶级国际主义和真正的马克思列宁主义原则基础上的战斗友谊。
    阿吉托罗普说：印度尼西亚共产党人和人民在反对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事独裁的野蛮白色恐怖的斗争中，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义帮助法西斯军事独裁的真正联合行动中所取得的经验，证明了毛泽东同志在贺电里所提出的号召是正确的，是当务之急，这个号召就是：全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。
    新西兰共产党代表团团长、全国委员会政治委员会委员雷·纽恩斯说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会是具有伟大国内和国际意义的事件。代表大会完全坚持了对帝国主义和现代修正主义进行坚决和无情斗争的路线。它划清了马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义的界线，声明马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间不可能有中间道路。
    他说，各国马克思列宁主义政党和组织的许多代表出席这次大会表明，新的力量正在全世界兴起，他们决心同帝国主义进行斗争，同背叛工人阶级和劳动人民利益的修正主义者完全决裂。
    纽恩斯说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会表明，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和全世界的所有马克思列宁主义者同以我们当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党一起，团结前进，将结束帝国主义，建立一个社会主义大家庭的新世界。
    他强调指出，毛泽东同志致代表大会的贺电深刻地体现了无产阶级国际主义和马克思列宁主义的革命精神。贺电明确地表明了中国共产党同阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和所有革命者的团结。它表明，中国共产党对各国人民无限信任，相信他们能够战胜帝国主义，获得民族解放，进行社会主义革命。
    纽恩斯说，毛泽东的贺电是动员各国人民团结起来朝着唯一正确的道路胜利前进的号角，这就是在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下进行革命的阶级斗争和民族解放斗争的道路。它给了，并将继续给予全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命者以新的鼓舞。
    澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）代表团团长、中央委员赫·爱·奥沙利文指出，中国发射导弹核武器试验成功、革命发展的伟大成功以及红卫兵的成就，使美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义目瞪口呆。接着，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党召开了第五次代表大会，许多国家的共产党、工人党和马克思列宁主义组织的代表参加了这次大会，这是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的又一次巨大打击。
    他说，伟大的毛泽东是当代杰出的马克思列宁主义者，他对马克思列宁主义的科学发展作出了巨大贡献。伟大的毛泽东向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会发出的贺电是非常深刻的。我们建议认真地学习它。
    奥沙利文在谈话中特别强调根据毛泽东思想建设一个新型党的问题。他说，我们要为建立一个新型的、真正马克思列宁主义的革命政党而奋斗。在这方面，我们认为学习毛主席的著作，特别是《矛盾论》和《实践论》是非常重要的，当然全部毛主席著作都是极其重要的。
    奥沙利文批判了国际共产主义运动中所谓中间立场的谬论。他说，中间立场是没有的。你要么是拥护马克思列宁主义和世界革命，要么就是反对。如果反对马克思列宁主义和世界革命，你就是自觉或不自觉的反革命。
    比利时共产党代表团团长、中央委员会书记雅·格里巴说：毛泽东同志在贺电中正确地赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民，指出以苏共修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者只不过是“一抔黄土”，而社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚是“耸入云霄的高山”，从而鼓舞了全世界革命者从阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的勇敢和坚定性中得到启示。
    格里巴强调指出，毛泽东同志在贺电中指出了世界革命的发展、胜利和辉煌前途，号召全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，并建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，从而又一次大大地鼓舞了一切革命者加倍努力，进行战斗。
    玻利维亚共产党代表团团长、中央书记处书记奥斯卡·萨莫拉说，这次代表大会对阿尔巴尼亚人民具有重大历史意义，同时，对国际共产主义运动也作出了重大贡献。从这次代表大会，我们看到全世界马克思列宁主义力量正在发展、壮大，现代修正主义正在走下坡路。我们看到，中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党受到了全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的尊敬和热爱，而苏共领导集团勾结美帝国主义妄图孤立中国和阿尔巴尼亚又一次遭到了失败。
    他在揭露苏联修正主义集团反动的“联合行动”谬论时说，苏联修正主义者把马克思列宁主义者和革命人民不同他们搞所谓“联合行动”说成是不愿意支援越南人民，这是彻头彻尾的陈词滥调。苏联修正主义者，口头上大叫“援助越南”，表面上给点物质援助；但是，这掩盖不了他们破坏越南人民抗美救国斗争的真实目的。许多事实表明，苏联修正主义者早已同美帝国主义者搞联合行动了。苏联修正主义者梦想利用“联合行动”招牌，充当世界革命的老板，以便同帝国主义的老板——美国搞两大国主宰世界的交易，这是绝对欺骗不了马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的。
    他在谈到毛主席给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电时说，毛主席的贺电生动地体现了伟大的毛泽东思想，是马克思列宁主义的重要文献。这不仅是给阿尔巴尼亚同志的贺电，也是给全世界马克思列宁主义者、革命人民的贺电。我们受到了极大的鼓舞。
    他说，我们的任务是使我们党和我国人民，学习和掌握伟大的毛泽东思想——当代的马克思列宁主义。我们相信，当玻利维亚人民用毛泽东思想武装起来的时候，他们将是不可战胜的。
    萨莫拉说，我们要紧张地工作，为实现毛泽东同志的“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派”的伟大号召而努力奋斗。
    智利革命共产党代表团团长、中央书记处书记霍尔赫·迪亚斯说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的决议，必将动员阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命、社会主义建设中取得更大成就，必将进一步加强反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争，对世界革命和捍卫、发展马克思列宁主义作出新的贡献。
    他说，毛泽东同志给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电是对全世界所有的马克思列宁主义政党和革命人民的巨大鼓舞和支持，它将唤起他们的革命斗争精神，并以贺电的思想为绝好的武器，去争取新的胜利。
    他指出，我们党认为，世界革命的经验证明了毛泽东思想的正确性，证明了毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我们正在以巨大的努力，在我们的实际斗争中学习和运用毛泽东思想。我们坚信，世界人民一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就一定能够取得战胜帝国主义、修正主义、反动派的彻底胜利。
    意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）代表团团长、总书记福·迪努齐说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，不仅对为建成社会主义而努力的阿尔巴尼亚人民来说是具有历史意义的事件，而且对所有反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和反对反动派而进行斗争的各国人民来说，也是一个历史性的事件。
    他说，各国马克思列宁主义者在进行反对帝国主义和反对各国反动派斗争的同时，必须坚决反对现代修正主义。在马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间没有中间立场，没有中立道路。任何不坚定的和妥协的立场势必对帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的阴谋有利。
    他指出，毛泽东主席对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电，在阿尔巴尼亚代表和兄弟党代表中间引起了极大的热潮。这一贺电是以毛泽东思想为指南的光荣的中国共产党的一个重要的文献，是对马克思列宁主义创造性的发展。
    迪努齐说，毛泽东主席的贺电称人民的阿尔巴尼亚是“欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”，这为欧洲的马克思列宁主义者增添了极大的干劲，因为他们正以阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为榜样，去建立反对帝国主义、资产阶级和现代修正主义的无产阶级的坚强不屈的先锋队。
    他说，毛泽东主席的贺电给我们指出了在各方面进行阶级斗争的道路。贺电中提出的“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来……”，是对我们最基本的教导。每一个马克思列宁主义者都应当用贺电来丰富自己的革命的思想意识。
    法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）代表团团长、书记处书记、政治局委员雷·卡萨说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，对各个马克思列宁主义政党和组织的代表团，包括我们的代表团在内，是个巨大的鼓舞。
    他说，康生同志在会上宣读的毛泽东主席——当代的列宁的贺电，强有力地武装了我们的思想。贺电中指出的革命叛徒们只不过是“一抔黄土”，而革命的力量是“耸入云霄的高山”的提法，在马克思列宁主义新生力量和背叛革命的腐朽力量之间严格地划清了界线。
    黎巴嫩社会主义革命党代表团团长、中央委员会主席优·穆巴拉克指出，毛泽东主席给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电具有巨大的国际意义，是一个十分重要的文件。它鲜明地反映出中国共产党同阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的兄弟般的战斗友谊。它表明了马克思列宁主义者在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上、在反对美帝国主义和以苏联领导集团为代表的现代修正主义的共同斗争的基础上的真正的团结。
    他说，对我们黎巴嫩共产党人来说，贺电是兄弟的中国共产党及其敬爱的导师、我们亲爱的毛泽东同志本人对加强反对我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的斗争的一个巨大贡献。我们黎巴嫩共产党人把毛主席的贺电当作纲领，当作在政治、思想、理论和组织上进行斗争的马克思列宁主义路线。毛主席的贺电指出：“马克思列宁主义真理在我们一边。国际无产阶级在我们一边。被压迫民族和被压迫人民在我们一边。全世界百分之九十以上的人民大众在我们一边。我们的朋友遍天下。我们不怕孤立，也绝不会孤立。我们是不可战胜的。一小撮反华、反阿尔巴尼亚的可怜虫，是注定要失败的。”这是真理！
    穆巴拉克说，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派都反对中国和阿尔巴尼亚；而一切革命者，一切马克思列宁主义者，一切被压迫人民和民族，世界上一切正直的人都同中国站在一起，同中国共产党和毛主席，同阿尔巴尼亚及其劳动党和霍查同志站在一起。
    他说，整个进步人类，一切被压迫和被剥削人民，一切真正要求在马克思列宁主义革命红旗下进行革命，取得解放，争取社会主义胜利的人，都全心全意地欢迎毛主席致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电。
