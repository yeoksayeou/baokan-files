Edition: 4

The Chinese people, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are carrying out a thorough proletarian cultural revolution. This has brought about a new look to China, smashing the plots and tricks of the ghosts and monsters of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes who attempted to stage a comeback. The victory achieved by the Chinese people in the proletarian cultural revolution is our greatest joy. Mao Zedong Thought is the radiant red sun illuminating the five continents, and Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and the people of the world.

I long to have wings to fly immediately to the holy land of world revolution, Beijing, to see with my own eyes the great leader Chairman Mao.

    为中国文化大革命的胜利而高兴
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民正在进行一场翻天覆地的无产阶级文化大革命，这使中国的面貌焕然一新，粉碎了企图复辟的资产阶级和封建阶级的牛鬼蛇神的阴谋诡计。中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的胜利是我们最大的高兴。毛泽东思想是照耀五大洲光辉灿烂的红太阳，毛主席的健康是中国人民和世界人民最大的幸福。
    我多么盼望生有一双翅膀立即飞到世界革命圣地北京，亲眼看一看伟大领袖毛主席。
