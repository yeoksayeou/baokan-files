A grand rally of over 10,000 people from the revolutionary masses and Red Guards of the capital was held this afternoon to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of the great revolutionary pioneer Sun Yat-sen.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, He Long, Tan Zhenlin, Ye Jianying, Li Xuefeng, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Guo Moruo, He Xiangning, Yang Mingxuan, Peng Chuan, Zhang Zhizhong, Apho Angjin, Zhou Jianren, Xu Bing, Gao Chongmin, Cai Tingkai, Deng Zihui, Li Siguang, Xie Jueying, Shen Yanbing, Xu Deheng, Li Dequan, Yang Xiuqing, Zhang Dingxian, Deng Yingchao, Liao Chengzhi, Mu Xin, Jie Xuegong, Xu Guangping, Li Zongren, Xiong Kewu, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, and others attended the memorial meeting.

Before the meeting began, Zhou Enlai, Song Qingling, Dong Biwu, Tao Zhu, Chen Yi, and He Xiangning received some foreign friends, representatives from Hong Kong and Macau, and overseas Chinese who attended the meeting.

The memorial meeting was held in the magnificent Great Hall of the People. Large banners hung in the venue read: "Long live the great leader, great commander, great helmsman, and great teacher Chairman Mao!" "Commemorate the great revolutionary pioneer Sun Yat-sen." A portrait of Sun Yat-sen hung in the center of the stage, flanked by ten red flags and a golden plaque reading "1866-1966."

Before the memorial meeting began, the workers, people's commune members, soldiers and officers of the PLA, Red Guards, and cadres from various departments read aloud excerpts from Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen" written ten years ago: "Things are changing every day. The 1911 Revolution, or the Revolution of 1911, is now forty-five years old. China's face has completely changed. In another forty-five years, it will be the year 2001, the beginning of the 21st century. China's face will change even more. China will become a powerful socialist industrial country. China should be this way. Because China is a country with 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 600 million people, China should make a greater contribution to humanity. ..."

At 3:30 PM, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu of the People's Republic of China announced the beginning of the memorial meeting. The entire audience stood as the national anthem of the People's Republic of China was played.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu first delivered the opening speech. He briefly introduced Sun Yat-sen's immortal contributions in the struggle of the Chinese people against feudalism and imperialism. Vice Chairman Dong Biwu said, "We will never forget Sun Yat-sen's great contributions to the Chinese revolution. Sun Yat-sen is forever worthy of our commemoration."

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke at the meeting. At the beginning of his speech, he first quoted the high praise given by our great leader Chairman Mao in the article "In Memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen" for Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary and fighting life.

Premier Zhou said, "Sun Yat-sen's life shows that a true patriot, a true revolutionary democrat, must resolutely and uncompromisingly oppose imperialism." He said, "Today, as we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we must further carry forward Sun Yat-sen's spirit of struggle against imperialism, strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world against imperialism."

Premier Zhou said that Sun Yat-sen saw the hope of liberation for oppressed nations and peoples in the October Revolution led by Lenin. However, today, the Soviet leadership has completely betrayed the great Lenin and the great cause of the October Revolution, and has become a lackey of American imperialism. Premier Zhou said, "Today, as we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we must, together with the revolutionary peoples of the world, resolutely oppose the Soviet revisionist group that has betrayed Lenin and colluded with American imperialism, and carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end."

Premier Zhou said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have completed the democratic revolution that Sun Yat-sen did not complete and have developed this revolution into a socialist revolution, achieving great successes in socialist construction." Premier Zhou said, "Recently, our country's missile and nuclear weapon tests were successful, once again showing that the Chinese proletariat can do what Chinese bourgeois revolutionaries cannot do and will definitely build our country into a modernized socialist power in a not too long historical period, catching up with and surpassing the West."

When talking about the current Cultural Revolution, Premier Zhou emphasized, "We must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and not stop halfway. We must carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

Premier Zhou concluded, "The great struggles and great victories of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao have far surpassed the ideals of Sun Yat-sen. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. Today, as we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we must forever follow our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, forever be with the revolutionary people, strive to learn new things, constantly reform ourselves, and forever advance in the fiery struggle of the socialist revolution!"

Vice Chairman Song Qingling of the People's Republic of China delivered a long speech titled "Sun Yat-sen - A Steadfast and Indomitable Revolutionary" at the meeting. Her speech detailed the life and revolutionary activities of the great revolutionary pioneer Sun Yat-sen. Vice Chairman Song Qingling said, "Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to promoting revolution. This is still worth learning from today. There are still two-thirds of the people in the world who have not been liberated. We must persist in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and persist in the revolutionary struggle to build socialism and communism, so that our country can achieve modernization in all aspects and strive to reach new heights in science."

In the final part of her long speech, Vice Chairman Song Qingling said:

"Sun Yat-sen in his will asked all revolutionaries to continue the struggle until victory. The Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to realize this will and far surpassed it. If Sun Yat-sen were still alive, he would be proud of the Communist Party of China uniting the people of the whole country and all nationalities, leading the people to achieve great successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and firmly upholding the truth of Marxism-Leninism in the current world."

"Our people have achieved unprecedented unity, worked hard to develop production, and striven to reach new heights in science, education, and culture. With the development of the Cultural Revolution, our socialist revolution has entered a deeper and broader new stage. In the severe struggle against imperialism, especially against the main enemy of the people of all countries, American imperialism, our unity with the working people of the world and the unity with the oppressed nations and peoples are becoming stronger and stronger. The world is presenting a great revolutionary situation. The steadfastness and perseverance shown by Sun Yat-sen in his revolutionary struggle often inspire us. With an unshakable determination for our struggle goals, a strong belief in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and an infinite confidence in our strength to win victory, we will advance hand in hand with all those who strive for a world without man's exploitation of man, without national oppression, and without racial discrimination."

Chairman He Xiangning of the Chinese National Revolutionary Committee pointed out in her speech at the meeting that Sun Yat-sen led the Xinhai Revolution, which ended more than two thousand years of feudal imperial rule in China. In his later years, he also proposed the three policies of allying with Russia, opposing imperialism, allying with the Communists, and supporting farmers and workers, which are his great historical achievements.

He Xiangning said, "The greatest characteristic of Sun Yat-sen's life is his continuous progress, insistence on revolution, and increasing determination in his later years. Sun Yat-sen's late years are admired by all."

He Xiangning emphasized that Sun Yat-sen's ideal of building China has been far surpassed by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao. She enthusiastically praised the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao as a more significant event than the successful atomic bomb test, a great revolution that decides the fate of China and influences the future of the world.

He Xiangning concluded, "Although I am ninety years old, I still have the determination to keep up with the requirements of the times in the Cultural Revolution and to continue to maintain revolutionary integrity in this great revolution. I call on all comrades who have followed Sun Yat-sen to not be discouraged, not to rely on old age, not to sit on the baggage of old experience and not move an inch. We must be determined to follow Chairman Mao to the end, continue to reform ourselves, and continue to strive forward. I believe that only in this way can we best commemorate Sun Yat-sen and countless revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary predecessors."

Miyazaki Seiichi, Chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association, was invited to speak at the meeting. Miyazaki Seiichi's father and uncle were close friends of Sun Yat-sen. Miyazaki Seiichi said in his speech that Sun Yat-sen was not only a great pioneer of the Chinese democratic revolution but also made brilliant contributions to the friendship and unity of the peoples of China and Japan. He pointed out that Sun Yat-sen was not only a revolutionary who fought for the liberation of the Chinese people but also a revolutionary who had the ideal of fighting for the liberation of the oppressed peoples of Asia.

He said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the great Chinese people have smashed all the shackles of feudal forces and imperialist forces, liberated themselves, and established the People's Republic of China. In the past seventeen years, the Chinese people have not only completed the democratic revolution that Sun Wen could not complete but are also continuing the socialist revolution. Under the guidance of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, they are carrying out socialist construction on the basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Now, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is being carried out in China to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and has already achieved great successes, which will give new confidence and inspiration to the revolutionary forces of the world."

All the speeches at the meeting were met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

At the end of the meeting, the entire audience stood and applauded as the orchestra played "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

Those who attended today's meeting also included leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party and various departments of the State Council, leaders from the People's Liberation Army, various people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, some people's representatives and some political consultants in Beijing, and some members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

Many foreign friends and envoys from various countries in Beijing attended the meeting. Foreign friends seated on the stage included: Ismail Dure, head of the Guinean government economic delegation, Nguyen Minh Phuong, acting head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in China, General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists Association Chard, Japanese citizen Nishizawa Ryuji, Japanese peace activist Saionji Kuniichi, advisor Ito Takeo and head of the delegation to China to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, Matsunouchi Takehito, vice-chairman of the Greek-China Friendship Association Mrs. Kikitsis, secretary-general of the Belgium-China Friendship Association Mrs. Huisman, and foreign experts Sanper, Smith, and Liben.

    新华社十二日讯　首都革命群众和红卫兵一万多人，今天下午举行盛大集会，隆重纪念伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生诞生一百周年。

    大会开始前，周恩来、宋庆龄、董必武、陶铸、陈毅和何香凝，接见了参加大会的部分外国朋友、港澳人士和华侨代表。
    纪念大会在宏伟的人民大会堂举行。会场上高悬巨幅标语，上面写着：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”
  “纪念伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生”。主席台中央悬挂着孙中山先生的画像。画像两旁插着十面红旗，以及金色字标：“1866——1966”。
    纪念大会开始以前，参加大会的工人、人民公社社员、解放军指战员、红卫兵和机关干部，齐声朗读毛主席十年前所写的《纪念孙中山先生》一文中的语录：“事物总是发展的。一九一一年的革命，即辛亥革命，到今年，不过四十五年，中国的面目完全变了。再过四十五年，就是二千零一年，也就是进到二十一世纪的时候，中国的面目更要大变。中国将变为一个强大的社会主义工业国。中国应当这样。因为中国是一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六万万人口的国家，中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。……”
    下午三时三十分，中华人民共和国副主席董必武宣布纪念大会开始。全场起立，乐队高奏中华人民共和国国歌。
    董必武副主席首先致开幕词。他扼要地介绍了孙中山先生在中国人民反对封建主义和帝国主义的斗争中立下的不朽功勋。董必武副主席说：“我们永远不会忘记孙中山先生对中国革命事业所作出的伟大贡献。孙中山先生是永远值得我们纪念的。”
    周恩来总理接着在大会上讲话。他在讲话开始时，首先引述了我们伟大的领袖毛主席在《纪念孙中山先生》这篇文章中，对孙中山先生革命的战斗的一生所作的崇高评价。
    周总理说：“孙中山先生的一生表明：一个真正的爱国者，一个真正的革命民主派，必须坚决地、毫不妥协地反对帝国主义。”他说：“我们今天纪念孙中山先生，就要进一步发扬孙中山先生的反帝斗争精神，为解放台湾、实现祖国领土的完全统一而奋斗，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的反帝革命斗争。”
    周总理说，孙中山先生从列宁领导的十月革命中看到了被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的希望。可是，今天苏联领导集团完全背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了伟大的十月革命的道路，已经堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶。周总理说：“我们今天纪念孙中山先生，就一定要同全世界革命人民一道，坚决反对背叛列宁、联合美帝国主义的苏共修正主义集团，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。”
    周总理说：“中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，完成了孙先生没有完成的民主革命，并且把这个革命发展为社会主义革命，在社会主义建设事业中取得了伟大的成就。”周总理说：“前不久，我国导弹核武器试验成功，再一次表明，中国无产阶级不仅能够做到中国资产阶级革命家不能做到的事情，而且一定能够在不太长的历史时期内把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化强国，赶上和超过西方。”
    周总理在谈到当前的无产阶级文化大革命时强调指出：“我们必须彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。我们必须发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，决不半途而废。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    周恩来总理最后说：“中国人民在毛主席领导下所进行的伟大斗争，所取得的伟大胜利，都远远超过了孙中山先生的理想。毛泽东主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针。我们今天纪念孙中山先生，就要永远跟着我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，永远同革命人民在一起，努力学习新事物，不断改造自己，在社会主义革命的烈火中永远前进！”
    中华人民共和国副主席宋庆龄，在大会上发表了题为《孙中山——坚定不移、百折不挠的革命家》的长篇讲话。她的讲话，详尽地介绍了伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生的生平和革命活动。宋庆龄副主席说：“孙中山一生致力于推动革命。这一点今天仍然值得我们学习。世界上还有三分之二的人民没有获得解放，我们必须坚持反对帝国主义的革命斗争，坚持为建设社会主义和共产主义而进行的革命斗争，使我国在各方面实现现代化，并努力攀登科学高峰。”
    宋庆龄副主席在她的长篇讲话的最后部分说：
    “孙中山在遗嘱中要求所有革命者继续斗争，直到胜利。中国共产党领导中国人民实现了这一遗志，并远远超过了它。如果孙中山还健在，他会为中国共产党团结全国人民和全国各民族、领导人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得巨大成就并在当前世界上坚持马克思列宁主义真理的坚决立场而感到骄傲。”
      “我国人民实现了空前的团结，鼓足干劲发展生产和攀登科学、教育和文化的新高峰。随着无产阶级文化大革命的开展，我国的社会主义革命进入了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。我们在反对帝国主义、特别是各国人民的主要敌人美帝国主义的严峻斗争中，同全世界劳动人民的团结，同被压迫民族和被压迫人民的团结正在日益加强。全世界呈现着一片大好革命形势。孙中山在革命斗争中表现出来的坚定性和坚韧性经常鼓舞着我们。怀着对我们的奋斗目标的不可动摇的决心，对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的坚强信念以及对我们赢得胜利的力量的无限信心，我们同一切为了实现一个没有人剥削人、没有民族压迫、没有种族歧视的世界而努力的人们，在斗争中携手前进。”
    中国国民党革命委员会主席何香凝在大会上的讲话中指出，孙中山领导的辛亥革命结束了中国两千多年的封建帝制，他在晚年又提出了联俄反帝、联共、扶助农工三大政策，这是他伟大的历史功绩。
    何香凝说：“孙中山先生一生最大的特点是他的不断进步，坚持革命，越到晚年越坚决。孙先生的晚节是万人共仰的。”
    何香凝强调指出，孙中山先生的建设中国的理想已经被伟大的毛主席领导下的中国人民远远地超过了。她热烈地赞颂毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命是比原子弹试验成功更重大的事件，是决定中国命运、影响世界前途的大革命。
    何香凝最后说：“尽管我九十岁了，我仍然有决心在文化大革命中努力跟上时代的要求，在这次大革命中继续保持革命晚节。我号召所有追随过孙中山先生的战友们，不要自馁，不要倚老卖老，不要一屁股坐在老资格的包袱上而寸步不前。我们要决心跟毛主席跟到底，继续改造自己，继续努力前进。我认为，只有这样，才是我们对孙中山先生和无数革命先烈、革命前辈的最好的纪念。”
    日中友好协会理事长宫崎世民应邀在大会上讲话。宫崎世民先生的父亲和伯父是孙中山先生的生前友好，情谊深厚。宫崎世民在讲话中说，孙中山先生既是中国民主革命的伟大先驱，又为日中两国人民的友好和团结作出了辉煌的贡献。他指出，孙中山先生不仅是为中国人民的解放而奋斗的革命家，而且也是抱有为亚洲被压迫民族的解放而奋斗的理想的革命家。
    他说：“伟大的中国人民在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导下，粉碎了所有封建势力和帝国主义势力的枷锁，解放了自己，建立了中华人民共和国。十七年来，中国人民不仅完成了孙文先生未能完成的民主革命，而且正在继续进行社会主义革命，正在无产阶级专政的基础上，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，进行着社会主义建设。”他说：“现在中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命是为了进一步巩固无产阶级专政，并已取得了巨大成就，这将给予世界革命力量以新的信心和鼓舞。”
    所有大会上的讲话，都在全场激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    大会结束时，全场起立鼓掌，乐队高奏《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》。
    参加今天大会的，还有中共中央机关和国务院各部门的负责人，中国人民解放军、各人民团体和北京市的负责人，在北京的人大常委会委员、政协全国委员会常务委员，在北京的部分人大代表和部分政协委员，以及民革部分成员。
