The imperialist United States and the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union are hastening to collude on the so-called issue of preventing nuclear proliferation, eager to finalize a deal.

Within the United Nations, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have put forth a joint proposal, demanding the "early conclusion of a treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation." Outside the United Nations, they are actively promoting and advertising this proposal.

This is an important component of the global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

This is another major betrayal by the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union after signing the partial nuclear test ban treaty with three other countries.

What is meant by preventing nuclear proliferation? Why do the U.S. and the Soviet Union need this treaty?

The so-called prevention of nuclear proliferation is to regard nuclear weapons as the exclusive domain of the two nuclear superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, allowing only them to possess nuclear weapons and prohibiting others from doing so. This is to acknowledge the hegemonic status of the two nuclear superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, granting the imperialist United States the special privilege of nuclear blackmail for aggression, while depriving other countries of the right to develop nuclear weapons to resist U.S. nuclear blackmail.

The treaty on preventing nuclear proliferation designed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is extremely unequal and unjust for all countries in the world. The U.S. and the Soviet Union can freely develop nuclear weapons and maintain nuclear monopolies, while countries without nuclear weapons are not allowed to even think about nuclear weapons. This is not enough; they must also sign and seal their commitment not to do so and not to think about it. Where in the world is there such logic?

This treaty is a big deception. Who is actually spreading nuclear weapons? It is the imperialist United States. It is the biggest spreader of nuclear weapons in the world. The United States has established numerous nuclear bases around the world; U.S. aircraft and submarines carrying nuclear warheads are roaming freely across all continents and oceans. This treaty is actually a cover-up for the U.S. imperialist's nuclear proliferation, deceiving the people of the world.

The leadership of the Soviet Union wants to sign such a treaty with the United States, which is another major exposure of their traitorous face.

In the past, the leadership of the Soviet Union still pretended to oppose the U.S.'s so-called "multilateral nuclear force" plan, which is to oppose the U.S. spreading nuclear weapons to West Germany in some form. Now, the United States has not changed its policy, but has played a new trick, using the "Special Committee on Nuclear Planning" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and similar entities to replace the "multilateral nuclear force," allowing West Germany to still have access to nuclear weapons. Recently, the U.S. State Department openly stated that the signing of the treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation will not hinder West Germany from obtaining a "nuclear-sharing position" within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, the leadership of the Soviet Union has publicly stated that there are now no difficulties in signing this treaty. This is actually equivalent to tacitly agreeing that the United States can spread nuclear weapons to West Germany, while the Soviet Union itself undertakes the unilateral obligation of not spreading nuclear weapons. This is a great betrayal of the interests of the Soviet people, the interests of the people of socialist countries, and the interests of the people of the world.

The leadership of the Soviet Union argues that if nuclear proliferation is not stopped now, more and more countries will possess nuclear weapons, greatly increasing the danger of nuclear war.

The question is, where does the danger of nuclear war come from now? Is it not from the imperialist United States, but from countries without nuclear weapons? The facts are clear: to reduce and prevent the danger of nuclear war, one must oppose the U.S.'s nuclear war preparations and nuclear threats, and strive for a comprehensive ban and complete destruction of nuclear weapons, rather than preventing nuclear proliferation.

The fact is, when the United States was the sole possessor of nuclear weapons, it was unwilling to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons. In a situation where only a few countries have nuclear weapons, the United States is also unwilling to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons. Only when more countries possess nuclear weapons, breaking the U.S.'s nuclear monopoly, can the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons be possible. Under the current circumstances, instead of opposing the nuclear weapons in the hands of the United States, indiscriminately opposing other countries' development of nuclear weapons will only help the United States maintain its nuclear monopoly. How can this reduce the danger of nuclear war?

The leadership of the Soviet Union also argues that signing the treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation is beneficial to non-nuclear countries. They express "concern" for non-nuclear countries, saying that many countries cannot develop atomic bombs, and developing atomic bombs will only impoverish themselves. In their view, the best solution is for the two nuclear superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, to provide nuclear "protection" to non-nuclear countries.

What nonsense! Whether all countries in the world want to develop nuclear weapons is their own business. Before a comprehensive ban and complete destruction of nuclear weapons, no one can deprive them of the right to possess nuclear weapons. Even if they do not have nuclear weapons, they should not be considered inferior. To divide countries in the world based on whether they have nuclear weapons, treating those with atomic bombs as superior and those without as inferior, believing that having atomic bombs allows one to bully others and those without must submit, is a typical big-power chauvinist argument, a typical imperialist hegemonic argument. Moreover, the so-called nuclear protection, if provided by the United States, is like inviting a wolf into the house; if provided by the leadership of the Soviet Union, it can only place one's own country under the control of big-power chauvinism. No matter which kind of "protection," it is an infringement on the sovereignty and interests of non-nuclear countries, turning the people of non-nuclear countries into nuclear slaves.

The leadership of the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that the U.S. aggression in Vietnam hinders U.S.-Soviet cooperation. This is all lies. The actual situation is that they have been colluding with the United States on the Vietnam issue, greatly assisting it, and the political deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are becoming bigger and bigger. In the face of the ever-expanding U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam, the leadership of the Soviet Union is eager to sign a treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation with the United States, further exposing their shameless faces of false support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people.

The U.S. and the Soviet Union colluding to push the so-called treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation is also part of their joint anti-China conspiracy. After China successfully launched a missile and nuclear weapon test, they became even more eager to finalize this deal, attempting to limit China's influence. This is in vain. The news release of October 27 of our country pointed out: "China's development of nuclear weapons is precisely to oppose the U.S.-Soviet collusion in implementing nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. The Chinese people's mastery of missiles and nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are waging an anti-U.S. national salvation war, and to the revolutionary people of the world who are fighting bravely. It is a new contribution to the defense of world peace." China's influence is irresistible.

China is continuing to develop its own nuclear weapons, but we will never think that having nuclear weapons entitles us to any special privileges. In the past, present, and future, we firmly oppose great-power chauvinism and firmly advocate that all countries in the world, regardless of size and whether they have nuclear weapons, should be treated equally. We will never participate in the so-called treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation, stripping non-nuclear countries of their rights and harming the interests of the people of the world. We will firmly stand with the people of the world to oppose the U.S. imperialist's nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, and strive for a comprehensive ban and complete destruction of nuclear weapons.

    美苏两个核霸王的又一笔交易
    观察家
    美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，正在就所谓防止核扩散问题，加紧勾结，急于拍板成交。
    在联合国内，美苏搞了一个联合提案，叫嚷要“尽早缔结一项关于不扩散核武器条约”。在联合国外，它们到处鼓吹，大做广告。
    这是美苏全球性大勾结的一个重要组成部分。
    这是苏联修正主义领导集团继签订三国部分停止核试验条约之后的又一次大叛卖。
    什么叫做防止核扩散？为什么美苏这两家需要这个条约？
    所谓防止核扩散，就是把核武器看作是美苏两个核霸王霸占的东西，只许他们有，不许别人有。这就是要别人承认美苏这两个核大国的霸权地位，给美帝国主义进行核讹诈的侵略特权，而剥夺其他国家发展核武器以抵抗美国核讹诈的防御权利。
    美苏合伙设计的防止核扩散条约，对世界各国是极不平等、极不公平的。美苏两国可以大搞核武器，大搞核垄断，而世界上无核武器的国家却压根儿不许沾核武器的边，甚至于连想也不许这样想。这还不够，还要它们签字画押，保证自己不这样做，也不这样想。天下哪里有这样的道理呢？
    这个条约，是一个大骗局。到底是谁在搞核扩散呢？就是美帝国主义。它是世界上最大的核扩散者。美国在世界各地建立了许多核基地；带核弹头的美国飞机和潜艇，在各大洲、各大洋，窜来窜去。这个条约实际上是替美帝国主义的核扩散打掩护，来愚弄世界人民。
    苏联领导集团要同美国签订这样的一个条约，这是它们叛徒面目的又一次大暴露。
    过去，苏联领导集团还装模作样地反对美国的所谓“多边核力量”计划，也就是反对美国以某种方式把核武器扩散给西德。现在，美国并没有改变它的这一方针，只是玩了一个新花样，用所谓北大西洋集团的“核计划特别委员会”之类的东西来替代“多边核力量”，使西德照样可以染指核武器。最近，美国国务院公开声称，防止核扩散条约的签订，不妨碍西德在北大西洋集团中“取得分享核的地位”。但是，苏联领导集团却公开表示，现在签订这个条约已经没有什么困难了。这实际上等于默认美国可以把核武器扩散给西德，而苏联自己则承担片面不扩散的义务。这是对苏联人民利益的大出卖，对社会主义国家人民利益的大出卖，对全世界人民利益的大出卖。
    苏联领导集团辩解说，如果现在不制止核扩散，就会有越来越多的国家掌握核武器，从而就要大大增加核战争的危险。
    试问，现在核战争的危险究竟来自何处？难道不是来自美帝国主义，反而是来自无核武器国家吗？事情很清楚，要减少和防止核战争的危险，就必须反对美国的核备战、核威胁，争取全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，而不是什么防止核扩散。
    事实是，在美国一国独占核武器的时候，要禁止使用核武器，美国是不干的。在只有少数几个国家有了核武器的情况下，要禁止使用核武器，美国也是不干的。只有更多的国家掌握了核武器，大家都有了，美国的核垄断地位被彻底打破了，才有可能禁止使用核武器。在目前情况下，不去反对美国手里的核武器，而不分青红皂白地反对别的国家发展核武器，这只会帮助美国保持核垄断。这哪里会减少核战争的危险呢？
    苏联领导集团又辩解说，签订防止核扩散条约，对无核国家有好处。他们对无核国家表示“关心”，说什么许多国家是不能搞原子弹的，一搞原子弹就要使自己穷困起来。在他们看来，最好的办法，就是由美苏两个核大国对无核国家提供核“保护”。
    这是什么话！世界上所有的国家，是不是要发展核武器，这是它们自己的事情。在没有全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器以前，谁也不能剥夺它们拥有核武器的权利。即使它们没有核武器，也不能把它们看作低人一等。按照有没有核武器，把世界各国分成保护国和被保护国，认为有了原子弹就可以骑在别人头上作威作福，没有原子弹就只好称臣纳贡，这是典型的大国主义的论调，是典型的帝国主义强权政治的论调。而且，所谓核保护，如果是由美国来提供，那正好是引狼入室；如果是由苏联领导集团来提供，那也只能是把自己的国家置于大国沙文主义的控制之下。不论那一种“保护”，都是对无核国家主权和利益的侵犯，都是要无核国家的人民充当核奴隶。
    苏联领导集团一再表白，美国侵略越南的战争妨碍美苏合作。这完全是假话。实际情况是，他们不仅一直在越南问题上同美国勾结，大帮其忙，而且美苏之间的政治买卖越做越大。在美国侵越战争不断扩大的情况下，苏联领导集团急于同美国签订防止核扩散条约，进一步暴露了他们对越南人民假支持、真出卖的无耻嘴脸。
    美苏两家串通一气，搞什么防止核扩散条约，也是它们联合反华大阴谋的一部分。在中国发射导弹核武器试验成功之后，它们就更加迫不及待地要做成这笔交易，想要限制中国的影响。这是白费心机。我国十月二十七日的新闻公报指出：“中国发展核武器，正是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断和核讹诈。中国人民掌握了导弹和核武器，对于正在进行抗美救国战争的英雄的越南人民，对于全世界正在进行英勇斗争的革命人民是一个巨大的鼓舞，对于保卫世界和平是一个新的贡献。”中国的这种影响，是不可抵挡的。
    中国正在继续发展自己的核武器，但是，我们绝不因为有了核武器就认为自己应当享有什么特权。过去、现在和将来，我们都坚决反对大国主义，坚决主张世界各国不论大小，不论有没有核武器，应当一律平等。我们绝不参加所谓防止核扩散条约，来剥夺无核国家的权利，损害世界人民的利益。我们坚决同全世界人民一道，为反对美帝国主义的核讹诈和核威胁，为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器而斗争。
