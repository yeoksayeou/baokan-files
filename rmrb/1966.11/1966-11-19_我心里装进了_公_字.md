	I Have Put the "Public" in My Heart
	Hubei Shì Qíchuān Xiàn Liánhuā Gōngshè Female Community Member Hú Qiūxiāng

	In the past, I was a backward community member who had not shed my low-level interests. I worked only to grab work points, kept the good fertilizer for myself, and tried every means to benefit from the collective. My house was relatively spacious, and when the production team needed to borrow it, I preferred to leave it empty rather than lend it. At that time, my heart had only the word "private," and I did not care at all about collective matters.

	Through the socialist education movement and studying Chairman Mao's Quotations, I gradually came to understand: a person living in this world cannot just think of himself; he must care about the collective and the revolution. From then on, I put the word "public" in my heart.

	Now, when I see someone harming the collective's interests, I feel angry. When I see collective property left outside, I pick it up. Once, two of my relatives went to the mountains of our brigade to cut firewood and cut several small trees from the collective. I was so angry that I wanted to send them to the brigade. My husband told me not to say anything, to just let it go since they were relatives. I said, "Public is public, private is private. Even if relatives cut the collective's trees, I cannot remain silent."

	One morning, it rained heavily, and I saw the collective's plow left in the field. I thought: this is collective property, and I cannot let it get ruined. I decided to carry it back. However, the plow was covered in yellow mud, and I was wearing a newly changed cotton shirt. Yellow mud on a white shirt would be hard to wash off! I quickly thought of the eight words "Serve the People Wholeheartedly." Dr. Norman Bethune sacrificed his life to help the Chinese revolution. Could I, for fear of dirtying a shirt, stand by and watch collective property get damaged? Thinking of this, I decided to carry the plow back. However, the plow was heavy, the rain made the path slippery, and it was hard to walk. I wavered again and thought of just taking the plow handle back and leaving the plow in the field. But then I thought, this is not completely and thoroughly serving the people; it is half-hearted. I remembered the words, "Resolutely carry out the revolution and be ready to make sacrifices." Instantly, I felt a surge of strength and carried the plow back.

### 我心里装进了“公”字

    我心里装进了“公”字
    湖北蕲春县莲花公社女社员　胡秋香
    过去，我是个没有脱离低级趣味的后进社员，做活只顾抢工分，好肥不交给集体，还千方百计想沾集体的光。我家的房子比较宽敞，生产队要借用，我宁愿空着也不肯借。那时，我的心里只有一个“私”字，对集体的事完全不关心。
    经过社会主义教育运动，学习了《毛主席语录》，我慢慢地懂得：一个人活着，不能光为自己，要关心集体，关心革命。打这起，我心里装进了一个“公”字。
    现在，我见到有人损害集体利益的事，心里就有气。见到集体的东西丢在外面，我就收起来。有一次，我的两个亲戚，到我们大队山上砍柴，砍了好几根队上的小树条，我气急了，要把他们送到大队去。我爱人要我莫说，亲戚里道的算了。我说，公是公，私是私，亲戚砍了集体的树也不能不说。
    一天早晨，天下大雨，我看到队上的犁丢在地里，心想：这是集体财产，不能让它淋坏了，就想把它背回去。但是，犁上满是黄泥巴，我又穿着一件刚换的细布褂儿，黄泥巴弄到白衣服上，才难洗呢！我很快又想到“毫不利己专门利人”八个字。白求恩同志为了帮助中国革命，牺牲了生命，我还能怕弄脏一件衣服，看着集体财产受损失不管吗？想到这里，我决心把犁背走。但是，犁很重，下雨路滑，很难走，我又动摇了。就想只把“犁藤”拿回去，犁放在地里算了。转念一想，这不是完全、彻底为人民服务，而是半心半意。我又想到“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这句话，顿时增加了无限的力量，把犁背起来就走回去了。
