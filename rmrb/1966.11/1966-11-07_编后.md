Editorial Note

Why were the young revolutionaries, mainly from the Red Guards of some art academies in the capital, able to successfully stage the famous revolutionary modern Beijing operas *The Red Lantern* and *The Battle at Shangganling* in such a short time? Why did these young, inexperienced revolutionaries dare to take to the stage with a revolutionary demeanor, break through the old frameworks of bourgeois experts, and excel in revolutionary artistic creation? It is the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought that encouraged them to charge forward, and it is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that stirred their ambitious aspirations.

They followed Chairman Mao's teachings to perform for the revolution. They wanted to "sing the strongest note of the proletariat." No experience? They listened to Chairman Mao's words, gained experience from practice, and derived good methods from the collective wisdom of the masses. Did they encounter many difficulties? They listened to Chairman Mao's words, faced difficulties, studied difficulties, and resolutely overcame difficulties. When practicing difficult movements, their indomitable spirit of not fearing falls or failures truly inspired respect. In the face of success and praise, they also listened to Chairman Mao's words, affirmed their achievements, recognized and corrected their shortcomings, and continued to advance.

Their spirit of seriously reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions is worthy of learning by all revolutionaries, especially revolutionary cultural workers.

    以首都一部分艺术院校的红卫兵为主的小将们，为什么能够在短短的时间里，自导自演，成功地演出了著名的革命现代京剧《红灯记》和《沙家浜》呢？为什么这些年轻、没经验的小将们，敢于以革命的雄姿，踏上舞台，冲破资产阶级专家的一些旧框框，在革命艺术创造上大显身手呢？是毛泽东思想鼓舞他们冲锋，是无产阶级文化大革命激荡起他们的壮志豪情。
    他们按照毛主席的教导，要为革命而演戏。他们要“唱出无产阶级的最强音”。没有经验吗？他们听毛主席的话，从实践中找经验，从集中群众智慧中得出好的办法来。遇见许多困难吗？他们听毛主席的话，面对困难，研究困难，坚决去战胜困难。他们在练难度较大的动作时，那种不怕跌、不怕失败的顽强精神，真叫人看了倍增敬意。他们在成功与表扬面前，也是听毛主席的话，肯定成绩，认识并改正缺点，继续前进。
    他们认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的精神，值得一切革命者，特别是革命的文艺工作者学习。
