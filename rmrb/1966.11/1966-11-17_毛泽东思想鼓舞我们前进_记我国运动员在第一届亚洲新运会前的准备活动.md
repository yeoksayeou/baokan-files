The First Asian New Forces Games will soon open in the beautiful capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh. Our athletes have arrived in Phnom Penh, carrying the expectations of the 700 million people of our nation. However, their determination to strive for friendship, unity, and anti-imperialism under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, and their passionate preparations for the games, remain vivid in people's minds. Let Mao Zedong Thought Shine at the Asian New Forces Games

"Let the light of Mao Zedong Thought shine at the Asian New Forces Games!" This is what the world champion Chinese women's table tennis team said, expressing the sentiments of all Chinese athletes participating in the games.

They said this in late October. At that time, less than a month remained until the opening of the Asian New Forces Games, and the various preparations before the games were very tense. The athletes' study of Chairman Mao's works became even more serious. They always remembered the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without a correct political standpoint, one is like a person without a soul." They consistently placed the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all their work. They told the reporter: "This is what our task of participating in the Asian New Forces Games requires. We are athletes of the new China, nurtured under the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We not only want to achieve good results at the Asian New Forces Games but, more importantly, we want to demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We want to achieve the goals of promoting friendship, mutual progress, common development, and unity against imperialism. We want the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought to shine at the Asian New Forces Games!"

We met many athletes who were about to participate in the Asian New Forces Games and found that the words of the young table tennis players were also the shared sentiment of all the athletes. The athletes said that before the opening of the Asian New Forces Games, there were many preparations to be made, but the most important preparation of all was to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively.

Make the Greatest Effort to Master Mao Zedong Thought

Comrade Lin Biao instructed that all comrades should make the greatest effort to truly master and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The athletes representing our nation in this international competition further clarified their direction of effort and found the strength to advance from Comrade Lin Biao's great call. A new situation of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works emerged rapidly in various sports delegations.

Upon entering the residence of the cycling delegation, people were quickly drawn to a carefully designed wall newspaper. On it were two prominent slogans: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and welcome the First Asian New Forces Games" and "Take 'Three Articles' as our motto." The athletes wrote many articles expressing their determination and insights from studying Chairman Mao's works.

These brief slogans and articles clearly reflected the athletes' efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Such determination could be felt in all the sports delegations. The athletes took "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "On Practice" as their mottos, and took Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old man moving mountains as their learning examples. They examined their thoughts against Chairman Mao's instructions, formulated their training plans for the Asian New Forces Games according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and solved their ideological and technical difficulties using Chairman Mao's instructions. They carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, took them to the training ground, and wrote them on their rackets or wrists, taking Chairman Mao's teachings with them wherever they went. They studied Chairman Mao's works in their dormitories, in the dining hall, and on the training grounds. Everywhere was their classroom for studying Chairman Mao's works.

The shooting team comrades insisted on reading Chairman Mao's works every day, carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, and studying during spare moments on the shooting range.

Many athletes deeply felt that without a helmsman, one cannot sail, and without weapons, one cannot fight. The more one studies Chairman Mao's works, the more one can contribute to the Asian New Forces Games. With the red sun in one's heart, one can make Mao Zedong Thought shine brightly at the Asian New Forces Games!

Transforming the Soul with Mao Zedong Thought

In the matter of transforming the soul with Mao Zedong Thought, the deeds of the 32111 Hero Drilling Team were like a torch, igniting a blazing fire of ideological transformation among the athletes.

This drilling team, which has imprinted Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, dissolved it in their blood, and put it into action, with their moving deeds of daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, made the athletes once again recognize that they would represent the heroic spirit of 700 million Chinese people in their overseas competitions.

Could they be worthy of such a country? Could they represent such a people? The athletes were greatly inspired by the deeds of the hero drilling team and decided to take the heroes of the drilling team as their examples, to more thoroughly excavate the dirt deep in their souls. Various sports delegations launched a campaign to learn from the 32111 Hero Drilling Team.

The men's table tennis team, in a study session on Chairman Mao's works, shared their experiences in overcoming selfish thoughts and transforming their souls with Mao Zedong Thought. They believed that selfish thoughts are the greatest enemy to athletes. In a competition, if this enemy appears in one's mind, it will be a double attack from within and without. Therefore, transforming one's soul with Mao Zedong Thought is of great significance to athletes.

Some gymnasts had some fear of certain high-difficulty movements. In the past, they often found reasons from objective factors. Now, they examined themselves according to Chairman Mao's teachings and found that the root cause lay in the word "self." They strove to study the "Three Articles" and engaged in a tenacious struggle against the word "self."

Such examples, of course, were not isolated. The athletes realized that they must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, using Mao Zedong Thought to constantly overcome and resist various non-proletarian ideologies, and achieve their ideological transformation. Only in this way could they overcome various difficulties and achieve brilliant results shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Training Grounds Become a Great School of Mao Zedong Thought

The athletes' training grounds were indeed a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Here, we saw the athletes reciting Chairman Mao's quotations together before training, participating in meetings to summarize successful experiences and lessons from failures according to Chairman Mao's teachings, hearing athletes encouraging each other with Chairman Mao's instructions, and naturally, personally feeling the great power of Mao Zedong Thought on the athletes. A recent practice competition held by the track and field team was a good example.

It was a cloudy, cold afternoon. Just as the competition was about to begin, it started to rain. The track was wet and slippery from the rain, and the athletes' sportswear was soaked. In such bad weather, we originally thought the competition could not be held. However, the athletes themselves proposed that why couldn't the competition be held in the rain and cold? If they encountered such weather at the Asian New Forces Games, could the Chinese athletes armed with Mao Zedong Thought emphasize difficulties? The athletes recited Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again: "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by enemies." They expressed over and over again their determination to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions: "Resolve to fight, be prepared to make sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's words gave them boundless strength, and the competition proceeded as planned. The athletes said that the more unfavorable the conditions, the more they could temper their revolutionary will to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words and loyally carry out Mao Zedong Thought.

As we write this, we are reminded of another story of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works: Our national badminton athletes, who have achieved many victories on the world badminton stage, used Mao Zedong Thought to turn unfavorable conditions into favorable ones. The badminton athletes' training ground had strong reflections, and there were many people training inside, making it quite noisy. At first, the badminton team members were not used to it, and their training was affected to some extent. The athletes brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's words: "The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not in its external but in its internal contradictions." Yes, one should realize that the factors affecting concentration are mainly not the bad objective conditions but one's own thoughts not being firm. From then on, the badminton team members consciously concentrated their minds and tempered their ability to compete in various situations against external interference. After a few days of such training, they not only adapted to those unfavorable conditions but also trained their ability to perform in complex environments.

The reporter visited many training grounds and met many athletes. Countless examples made us understand more deeply the meaning of the phrase "Mao Zedong Thought inspires our progress." They are indeed advancing under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, our athletes will soon participate in various competitions at the Asian New Forces Games. Let us wish them, under the inspiration of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to continue to advance and make greater progress!

### 毛泽东思想鼓舞我们前进——记我国运动员在第一届亚洲新运会前的准备活动

    毛泽东思想鼓舞我们前进
    ——记我国运动员在第一届亚洲新运会前的准备活动
    第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会不久将在柬埔寨美丽的首都金边开幕。我国体育健儿们带着全国七亿人民的期望到达了金边。然而他们决心在毛泽东思想鼓舞下为增进友好，团结反帝而开好亚新会的誓言，他们满怀激情，紧张地进行各种准备活动的情景，却一直在人们的脑海中萦回。让毛泽东思想光芒照耀在亚新会上
      “让毛泽东思想的光芒照耀在亚新会上！”这是荣膺世界冠军的我国女子乒乓球队队员说的，这句话表达了我国全体参加亚新会运动员的心意。
    她们说这句话是在十月下旬。当时，距离亚新会开幕的日期不到一个月，运动会前的各项准备活动显得十分紧张，而运动员们活学活用毛主席著作更加认真。他们牢记伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的教导：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”，始终如一地把毛主席著作的学习放在一切工作的首位。她们对记者说：“这是我们参加亚新会的任务所要求的。我们是在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的新中国运动员，我们不仅要在亚新会上创造好的成绩，而且更重要的是要把用毛泽东思想武装的七亿中国人民的革命精神表现出来，实现增进友好、互相促进、共同发展、团结反帝的目标。要让毛泽东思想的灿烂光芒照耀在亚新会上！”
    我们接触了许多即将参加亚新会的运动员，我们发现，女子乒乓小将们的话也正是全体运动员共同要说的话。运动员都说，亚新会开幕前要做许多准备工作，但是千准备，万准备，最最重要的准备是活学活用毛主席著作。
  尽最大努力把毛泽东思想学到手
    林彪同志指示说，全体同志都应当尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。即将代表祖国人民参加这次国际比赛的体育健儿们，从林彪同志的伟大号召中进一步认清了努力方向，得到了前进的力量，一个活学活用毛主席著作运动的新局面在各个体育代表队迅速出现了。
    走进自行车代表队的住所，人们很快就被一块经过精心设计的墙报吸引住了。墙报上贴着两幅醒目的标语，一幅是“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迎接首届亚洲新兴力量运动会”；另一幅是“把‘老三篇’当作我们的座右铭”。运动员们写了许多自己学习毛主席著作的决心和心得体会的稿件。
    这些简短的标语和稿件，清楚地反映了健儿们活学活用毛主席著作的努力。像这样的决心在所有体育代表队那里都可以感受到。运动员们把《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》当作自己的座右铭，把张思德、白求恩、老愚公当作自己的学习榜样，对照毛主席的指示检查自己的思想，根据毛主席的指示制定自己参加亚新会的训练计划，运用毛主席的指示解决自己的思想问题和技术上的困难。他们把《毛主席语录》放在身边，带到训练场，写在球拍或手腕上，走到哪里就把毛主席的教导带到哪里。他们在宿舍里学，在食堂里学，在运动场地学。到处都是他们学习毛主席著作的课堂。
    射击队的同志们坚持天天读毛主席著作，随身带《毛主席语录》，在靶场上也抓紧空隙时间学习。
    许多运动员深有感触地说：没有舵手不能航行，没有武器不能打仗，现在多学一分毛主席著作，就会为亚新会多作出一分贡献，自己心里装着红太阳，才能在亚新会上让毛泽东思想大放光芒！
  用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂
    在用毛泽东思想改造自己灵魂的这个问题上，32111英雄钻井队的事迹就像火炬一样，在运动员中点燃了思想改造的熊熊烈火。
    这个把毛泽东思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上的钻井队，以刀山敢上、火海能闯的感人事迹，使运动员们再一次认识到，他们出国比赛将要代表七亿中国人民的英雄本色。
    自己能无愧于这样的祖国吗？自己能够代表这样的人民吗？运动员们从钻井队英雄的事迹中受到了巨大的鼓舞，决心以钻井队的英雄们为榜样，更彻底地挖出自己灵魂深处的污垢。各个体育代表队普遍开展了一个向32111英雄钻井队学习的活动。
    乒乓球男队在一次学习毛主席著作的讲用会上，介绍了他们克服私心杂念、用毛泽东思想改造自己灵魂的经验。他们认为：私心杂念是对运动员威胁最大的敌人。在比赛中，两军对阵，如果自己头脑里出现了私心杂念这个敌人，就会遭到内外夹攻。因此，用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，对运动员有着极其重要的意义。
    体操队有的队员在个别高难度动作面前产生了某种畏难情绪。过去，他们往往从客观上找原因。现在，他们按照毛主席的教导去检查，找到了根子在于一个“私”字。他们努力学习“老三篇”，同“私”字展开了顽强的战斗。
    类似这样的事例，当然不是个别的。运动员们认识到，必须努力活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想不断克服和抵制各种非无产阶级的思想意识，实现自己的思想革命化。也只有这样，才可能克服各种困难，创造出闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的优异成绩。
  训练场成了毛泽东思想大学校
    运动员们的训练场地，确实是一所毛泽东思想的大学校。在这里，我们看到了运动员们在训练前集体朗读毛主席语录的情形，参加了他们按照毛主席的教导来总结成功经验和失败教训的会议，听到了运动员们用毛主席的指示互相鼓励的声音，自然，也亲身感受到毛泽东思想在运动员身上产生的巨大威力。前些日子田径队举办的一次练习比赛，就是一个很好的例证。
    那是一个乌云密布，天气阴冷的下午。在比赛将要开始的时候，突然下起雨来。跑道被雨水浇得又湿又滑，运动员身上的运动衣也被打湿了。在这样的坏天气里，我们原以为不能举行比赛了。但是运动员们自己提出，雨天、冷天为什么就不能比赛？要是在亚新会也碰到这样的天气，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国运动员难道能够因此强调困难吗？运动员们一次又一次地朗诵毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”他们一遍又一遍地表示要执行毛主席的指示：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的话给他们增添了无穷的力量，比赛按原定计划进行了。运动员们说，条件越是不利，越能够锻炼我们坚决听毛主席的话、忠实贯彻毛泽东思想的革命意志。
    写到这里，我们又想起了另一个活学活用毛主席著作的故事：在世界羽毛球坛屡建战功的我国羽毛球运动员运用毛泽东思想把不利条件变成了有利条件。羽毛球运动员进行练习的场地反光很强，场内训练的人较多，因此也较喧闹。开始，羽毛球队队员很不习惯，训练受到了一定的影响。运动员带着这个问题学习了毛主席的这样一段话“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性。”对，应当认识到，影响集中精力的因素，主要的不是客观条件不好，而是自己的思想不过硬。从这以后，羽毛球队队员便针对外界的干扰，有意识地集中精力，锻炼自己在各种情况下都能进行比赛的本领。经过这样几天的训练，结果不仅适应了那些不利的条件，而且练出了在复杂的环境里发挥球技的能力。
    记者走访过不少训练场，也接触了不少运动员，无数的事例使我们更深刻地理解了“毛泽东思想鼓舞我们前进”这句话的含义。他们正是在毛泽东思想鼓舞下前进的。
    现在，我国体育健儿不久就要参加亚洲新兴力量运动会的各项比赛。让我们预祝他们在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞下，再接再厉，不断前进！　新华社记者
