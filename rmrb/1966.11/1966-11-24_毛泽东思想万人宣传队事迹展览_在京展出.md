The exhibition "Exhibition of the 'Mao Zedong Thought Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team'" is being held in Beijing.

Since November 4, tens of thousands of people from all over the country have continuously visited the exhibition, which introduces the deeds of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region unit in propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai this spring and summer. The exhibition is seen as a living classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a model for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Many people have written in the visitor's book expressing their resolve: "Learn from the PLA, like the Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team, read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, and be propagandists and disseminators of Mao Zedong Thought for life."

The exhibition is divided into four parts: "Mao Zedong's and the Party Central Committee's Deep Concern for the Disaster-Stricken People," "Let the Sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought Shine Upon the Earth," "The Incredible Power of Mao Zedong Thought," and "Propagate to the Masses, Educate Ourselves."

A large portrait of our most beloved great leader Mao Zedong in a green military uniform hangs prominently at the entrance of the exhibition hall. As people enter the exhibition hall with hearts full of love for the great leader Mao Zedong, they first see Mao Zedong's deep concern for the disaster-stricken people. After the strong earthquake in Xingtai in March, Mao Zedong sent Premier Zhou Enlai to personally visit the disaster area to comfort the affected people and sent a central delegation to comfort the disaster area. The People's Liberation Army, following Mao Zedong's teachings of serving the people wholeheartedly, rushed to the disaster area to rescue people. Mao Zedong sent airplanes and trucks to transport supplies to the disaster area. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the entire country have shown the revolutionary spirit of "one area suffers a disaster, eight areas provide support." From the forests of Changbai Mountain to the fishing ports of the South China Sea, from the coast of the East China Sea to the Pamir Plateau, from all corners of the country, batches of Mao Zedong's works, materials, and millions of remittance notes have been sent to the disaster area. The serfs of Tibet, who have traveled thousands of miles, sent a batch of fine horses to their class brothers who suffered the disaster. This part of the exhibition vividly reflects how, under the deep concern of Mao Zedong and with the strong support of the people of the entire country, the disaster-stricken people have launched a heroic struggle against the disaster and quickly overcome the rare earthquake disaster in history. Mao Zedong's deep concern for the disaster-stricken people has aroused boundless love for the great leader among tens of thousands of visitors, and many people have been moved to tears as they watch.

The second part of the exhibition focuses on introducing the deeds of this ten-thousand-person propaganda army, which enthusiastically propagates Mao Zedong Thought to the disaster-stricken people. It highlights the three experiences of the Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team in propagating Mao Zedong Thought: the greatest power lies in using Chairman Mao's words to propagate to the masses; the deepest influence comes from doing as Chairman Mao teaches; the best effect comes from starting propaganda from class education. Many visitors have called these three experiences the three treasures for spreading Mao Zedong Thought and have copied them down word for word.

The third part of the exhibition focuses on introducing how the people of Xingtai, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, have transformed their spiritual outlook and created the miracle of a bumper harvest in a year of great disasters. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary students from all over the country, upon seeing these earth-shaking changes, have written in the visitor's book: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Mao Zedong!" A delegation of poor and lower-middle peasants from Xingtai, who have come to visit five times, have been deeply moved. Brigade leader He Wenxian, with tears in his eyes, said: "This year, we have faced continuous natural disasters such as earthquakes, droughts, winds, pests, and floods. In the past, we would have been finished. But this year, in this year of great disasters, we have achieved a super bumper harvest. We do not rely on heaven or earth; we rely on the People's Liberation Army bringing us the great Mao Zedong Thought."

The last part is about propagating to the masses and educating ourselves. A large number of exhibits vividly illustrate that the countryside is a vast field, the poor and lower-middle peasants are the best teachers, and the process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the people is also a process of receiving education. In this part, it is emphasized that after the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have propagated in the countryside, they have received profound education, have become more conscious of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have become more determined to serve the people completely and thoroughly, and have further carried forward the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living. The "Four Good" units are better than before, and the "Five Good" soldiers are redder than before. A large number of facts have greatly educated the PLA soldiers and Red Guards who have come to visit. They have expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more consciously, to learn from the masses, to learn from the struggle, and to raise the level of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level! A Red Guard who came to Beijing from the Northeast for revolutionary linkage said: "In the future revolutionary journey, I will spread Mao Zedong Thought like the Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team, learn from the workers and peasants everywhere, face the wind and rain, gain experience, change my thoughts, and increase my abilities, and become a firm successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution."

This exhibition is jointly organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, North China Bureau, and the leading organs of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region. In nearly twenty days of exhibition, it has received tens of thousands of visitors.

    活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂　深入宣传毛泽东思想的活样板
   “毛泽东思想万人宣传队事迹展览”在京展出
    数十万人观看和学习了解放军在邢台地震灾区救灾工作中的模范事迹
    据新华社二十三日讯  介绍人民解放军北京部队某部今年春夏之间，在遭受严重地震灾害的邢台地区宣传毛泽东思想事迹的“毛泽东思想万人宣传队事迹展览”，从四日在北京展出以来，来自全国各地的观众川流不息。人们一致认为，这是一个活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，是宣传毛泽东思想的活样板。许多人激动地在留言簿上写下自己的决心：向解放军学习，像万人宣传队那样，读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，当一辈子毛泽东思想的宣传员、播种机。
    这个展览会有四个部分：毛主席和党中央对灾区人民的深切关怀；让毛泽东思想的阳光普照大地；毛泽东思想威力无穷；宣传群众，教育自己。
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身穿草绿色军装的巨幅照片，高悬在展览会的进口处。人们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情走进展览室的时候，首先看到的是毛主席对灾区人民的巨大关怀。今年三月，邢台地区发生强烈地震以后，毛主席派周恩来总理亲临灾区慰问受灾群众，派中央慰问团到灾区慰问；人民解放军遵循毛主席全心全意为人民的教导，星夜奔赴灾区奋力抢救；毛主席派飞机、汽车向灾区运送物资。全国人民在毛泽东思想的教导下，发扬“一方遭灾，八方支援”的革命精神，从长白山林区到南海渔港，从东海之滨到帕米尔高原，从祖国的四面八方寄来了大批毛主席著作，大批物资和千万张汇票，西藏的翻身农奴不远万里把一批骏马送给受灾的阶级弟兄。这一部分展品中还生动地反映：灾区人民在毛主席的深切关怀下，在全国人民的大力支援下，展开英勇的抗灾斗争，迅速地战胜了历史上罕见的地震灾害。毛主席对灾区人民的巨大关怀，唤起千千万万参观的人对伟大领袖无比热爱，许多人边看边感动得热泪盈眶。
    展览的第二部分，集中地介绍了这支万人宣传大军满腔热情地向灾区人民宣传毛泽东思想的事迹，突出地介绍了万人宣传队宣传毛泽东思想的三条经验——用毛主席的话宣传群众威力最大；照毛主席的教导做好样子，影响最深；从阶级教育入手进行宣传，效果最好。许多参观的人把这三条经验称作传播毛泽东思想的三件宝，逐字逐句抄在本子上。
    展览的第三部分，着重介绍了邢台地区人民，在毛泽东思想哺育下，精神面貌焕然一新，创造出大灾年头大丰收的奇迹。来自全国各地的工农兵群众和革命师生，看到这些翻天覆地的巨变，激动地在留言簿上写道：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”从邢台赶来参观的邢台地区贫下中农代表团，一连参观了五次。生产队长何文献热泪盈眶地说：“我们今年是地震、旱、风、虫、涝等自然灾害接连不断，要是在过去，我们一切都完了。可是我们在这大灾年头，却获得特大丰收。俺们不靠天，不靠地，就是靠解放军给俺们送来了伟大的毛泽东思想。”
    最后一部分是宣传群众，教育自己。大批展品生动地说明了农村是一个广阔的天地，贫下中农是最好的教师，向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想的过程，也是自己受教育的过程。在这一部分，着重介绍了广大指战员在农村宣传以后，受到深刻的教育，更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，更加坚定了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，进一步发扬艰苦朴素的光荣传统等生动事迹，四好连队比以前更好了，五好战士比以前更红了。大量的事实，使前来参观的解放军战士和红卫兵小将受到极大的教育，他们纷纷表示要更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，到群众中去学，到斗争中去学，把活学活用毛主席著作提高到新的水平！从东北来京进行革命串连的一位红卫兵说：“在今后的革命征途上，我要像万人宣传队那样传播毛泽东思想，处处向工农群众学习，经风雨，见世面，改造思想，增长才干，做一个坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    这个展览是中共中央华北局和人民解放军北京部队领导机关联合举办的。展出近二十天来，已接待数十万人。
