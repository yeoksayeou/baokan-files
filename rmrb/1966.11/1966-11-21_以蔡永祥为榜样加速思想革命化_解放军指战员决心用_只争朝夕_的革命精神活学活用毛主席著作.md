The People's Liberation Army's soldiers and officers across the army, navy, and air force have been enthusiastically studying the heroic deeds of Cai Yongxiang over the past few days. They unanimously declared: We must love Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader, and be forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, just like Cai Yongxiang. We must, like Cai Yongxiang, use the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must thoroughly eradicate the bourgeois "self" and firmly establish the proletarian "public," rapidly transform our souls, and achieve ideological revolutionization.

Many soldiers and officers in various units have studied Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds over and over again, discussing and comparing themselves in multiple sessions. The heroes and active learners of Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit of the Nanjing Army said in a discussion: To learn from Cai Yongxiang, we must be like him—having only Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in our hearts, fighting for the revolution while alive, and dedicating our lives to the revolution, forever being a soldier loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Deputy Battalion Commander of a certain unit in the Fuzhou Army, former lone hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Jian Haijin said: "Cai Yongxiang comrade fearlessly faced danger, selflessly rescued the Red Guards' special train, foiled the class enemy's evil plot, and defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He is another brilliant and outstanding representative of our era's selfless communist warriors. His deeds once again prove that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most selfless and fearless, unafraid of hardship and death, daring to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire, and are the most combat-ready."

The soldiers and officers in the unit where the late Ouyang Hai served decided to learn from Cai Yongxiang just as they learned from Ouyang Hai, to brave fire and water for the Party and the people, and to be fearless warriors who dare to stand firm even if the sky falls.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers believe that learning from heroes means learning the essence. Cai Yongxiang grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, so we must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. Many soldiers and officers in the Navy, Air Force, and units in Beijing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, as well as the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet Military Regions, have expressed their determination to learn from Cai Yongxiang, to seize every minute and second, to thoroughly eradicate the "self" and firmly establish the "public," and to strive to reach the peak of communist ideology. Deputy Squadron Leader of a certain unit in the Air Force, Xiao Gongjia said: "We must love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most, just like Cai Yongxiang comrade. We must use Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest weapon, to chop off the roots of individualism in our souls and blow up the fortress of selfish thoughts in our minds. Like aiming at and striking down invading enemy planes, we must aim accurately and strike hard, firmly knocking down the 'I' and making it never rise again."

The soldiers and officers of the "Model Red Ninth Company" in the Shenyang Army said, "Great Mao Zedong Thought nurtures all the heroes of our time. Cai Yongxiang is a evergreen pine tree nurtured by the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought. He consciously studies Chairman Mao's works, transforms his worldview, and is forever our learning example."

The broad masses of soldiers and officers in the Jinan, Kunming, Wuhan armies, as well as the Railway Engineering Corps and Signal Corps, are learning from the heroes' deeds while finding their own shortcomings; some have even held discussions on topics like "How to use Cai Yongxiang's brilliant life to demand our lives." Battalion Commander of the Kunming Army, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Zhu Yanyi said: "Cai Yongxiang comrade is only eighteen years old and has been in the army for only eight months. In terms of age, I am older than him; in terms of struggle experience, I am more experienced than him; in terms of the time I started studying Chairman Mao's works, I am earlier than him. However, my ideological awareness is not as high as his. The difference lies in the 'resolute' effort to transform the worldview. Learning from Cai Yongxiang means first learning from his 'ten thousand years is too long, we must seize the day' spirit, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and resolutely transforming the worldview."

Soldier Xu Ruming from the class where the late Wang Jie served said: "Cai Yongxiang and our late platoon leader Wang Jie are both shining examples for us young people to accelerate ideological revolutionization. I will, with the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day,' actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly transform the worldview, and establish a selfless communist ideology."

Platoon Leader Xu Changqing of a certain unit in the Wuhan Army said: "Cai Yongxiang comrade, for the revolution, is fearless of being crushed to pieces. His deeds make me deeply realize that the degree and speed of ideological revolutionization do not depend on the length of service but on the spirit of studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming the worldview. I will definitely learn from Cai Yongxiang comrade, with the greatest determination, master Mao Zedong Thought, and with the highest posture and standard, sprint towards the goal of revolutionization!"

In recent days, soldiers and officers stationed on the border and coastal defense lines have expressed their determination to be like Cai Yongxiang, to have clear distinctions between love and hate, to stand firm, to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, to maintain high revolutionary vigilance, and if the enemy dares to invade, to definitely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the enemy.

    以蔡永祥为榜样加速思想革命化
    解放军指战员决心用“只争朝夕”的革命精神活学活用毛主席著作
    据新华社二十日讯　中国人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，连日来热烈开展学习蔡永祥英雄事迹的活动，他们一致表示：要像蔡永祥那样，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想；要像蔡永祥那样，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，活学活用毛主席著作，大灭特灭资产阶级“私”字，大立特立无产阶级“公”字，高速度地改造自己的灵魂，实现思想革命化。
    各部队许多指战员一遍又一遍地学习蔡永祥烈士的英雄事迹，一次又一次地对照自己座谈讨论。南京部队某部战斗英雄和学习毛主席著作积极分子在座谈中，一致认为：学习蔡永祥，就要像他那样：心目中只有毛主席，只有毛泽东思想，生为革命战斗，死为革命献身，永远作一个无限忠于毛泽东思想的战士。福州部队某部副营长、前中国人民志愿军孤胆英雄简海金说：“蔡永祥同志临危不惧，奋不顾身，抢救红卫兵专车，粉碎了阶级敌人的恶毒阴谋，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命。他是我们时代一心为公的共产主义战士的又一个光辉而杰出的代表，他的事迹再一次证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最无私最无畏，不怕苦，不怕死，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，最有战斗力。”广州部队欧阳海生前所在部队的指战员们，决心要像学习欧阳海那样学习蔡永祥，为党和人民的利益赴汤蹈火，做一个天塌下来也敢顶的大无畏战士。
    广大指战员认为，学英雄要学根本。蔡永祥是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的，因此必须最坚决地响应林彪副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，提高到一个新阶段。海军、空军和北京、成都、兰州等部队以及内蒙古、新疆、西藏军区的许多指战员纷纷表示，要以蔡永祥为榜样，争分夺秒，大挖
  “私”字，大立“公”字，决心攀登共产主义思想的高峰。空军某部“航空兵英雄中队”副中队长萧功甲说：“我们一定要像蔡永祥同志那样，最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。决心用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，砍掉灵魂深处的个人主义思想，炸毁头脑里私心杂念的堡垒。像对待入侵敌机一样，瞄得准，打得狠，坚决把‘我’字打落在尘埃里，使它永世不得翻身。”沈阳部队“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”指战员们说，伟大的毛泽东思想哺育着我们时代的一切英雄，蔡永祥就是毛泽东思想阳光雨露培育成长的一棵万年青松，他自觉地学习毛主席著作，改造世界观，永远是我们学习的榜样。
    济南、昆明、武汉等部队以及铁道兵、通信兵部队的广大指战员，一边学英雄的事迹，一边找自己的差距；有的还展开“如何用蔡永祥光辉的一生要求我们的一生”等题目的座谈讨论。昆明部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、营长朱延义说：“蔡永祥同志今年才十八岁，入伍才八个月。论年龄，我比他大；论斗争经历，我比他长；论开始学习毛主席著作的时间，我比他早。但是，我的思想觉悟没有他高。千差万差，就差在改造世界观的这个‘狠’字上。学习蔡永祥，首先就是要学习他那种‘一万年太久，只争朝夕’的狠劲，活学活用毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。”济南部队王杰生前所在班的战士徐汝明说：“蔡永祥和我们老班长王杰一样，为我们青年加速思想革命化树立了光辉的榜样。我决心以‘只争朝夕’的革命精神，活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改造世界观，树立一心为公的共产主义思想。”武汉部队某部班长徐长清说：
  “蔡永祥同志，为革命不怕粉身碎骨，他的事迹，使我深刻地认识到，思想革命化的程度和速度，不取决于入伍时间的长短，而在于用什么精神学习毛主席著作，改造世界观。我一定要以蔡永祥同志为榜样，下最大的决心，把毛泽东思想学到手，用最高的姿态，最高的标准，向革命化目标跑步前进！”
    连日来，驻守在边防海防前线各部队的指战员纷纷表示，一定要像蔡永祥那样，爱憎分明，立场坚定，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，保持高度的革命警惕，如果敌人胆敢来犯，就一定坚决、彻底、干净、全部把敌人消灭掉。
