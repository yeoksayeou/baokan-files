	Selflessness and Selfishness Are Incompatible
		Platoon Leader Jie Jianbao, Beijing Military Region

	Previously, I did not have a correct understanding of Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely selfless, utterly altruistic." Often, I acted with a "selfish" motive when doing good deeds. When I first became a deputy platoon leader, once, the soldier Wang Jincai had an abscess on his waist and could not participate in training. I was very anxious, fearing it would affect the platoon's performance. Every time I brought the sick person's meal to him, I would think: Can't you endure this small ailment? I showed an impatient expression. Wang Jincai saw through my thoughts. One day, he said to me: "Deputy Platoon Leader, I'm not sick anymore. I can participate in training tomorrow." I had been hoping to hear him say this, so I happily said: "Alright!" Then I asked him if he had eaten. Wang Jincai countered: "Have you eaten?" I said: "We have." He said: "I thought the meal hadn't been served yet!" It was then that I realized Wang Jincai had not eaten. That day, I was so focused on the platoon's training that I forgot to send the sick person's meal slip to the mess hall. Chairman Mao said: "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and utter altruism is manifested in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." But what about me? On the surface, I hoped Wang Jincai would recover quickly and participate in training, "for the platoon's performance"; in reality, it was for my own glory. On the surface, it seemed like "altruism," but deep down, it was selfishness. This incident gave me a profound lesson: Why did I only think about wanting Wang Jincai to participate in training, but not about his sick person's meal? Ultimately, it was because my selfishness was too strong.

	After this incident, I began to pay more attention to "altruism," but I was still reluctant to give up "selfishness," wanting to be both "altruistic" and "selfish." Last year, during our field training in the countryside, the local villagers had difficulty finding firewood. I thought: If I use the midday rest time to help the masses collect some firewood, I can do a good deed for the masses and also receive praise from the company, wouldn't that be a win-win? I led my platoon members to collect over six hundred pounds of firewood in three midday rest periods and one Sunday. However, the company only praised the third platoon and did not mention ours at all. I was puzzled. We did good deeds and endured hardships, but why didn't we get any recognition? At that time, I summarized a "lesson": In the future, when doing good deeds, one must definitely look at the "wind direction" and definitely be the first to act, otherwise, one won't get any recognition, and doing good deeds will be in vain. Later, I repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and realized that my thoughts were wrong. Chairman Mao criticized such people: "When faced with a matter, one first thinks of oneself and then thinks of others. After doing a little work, one feels great and likes to boast, fearing that others won't know." Wasn't Chairman Mao criticizing me? When I collected firewood for the poor and lower-middle peasants, I was not concerned about the masses' lives but about whether I would receive praise. Isn't this "thinking of oneself first" and "liking to boast"? At that time, I thought: Heroes like Norman Bethune, Zhang Side, and Lei Feng could be completely selfless and utterly altruistic because they were completely selfless. The more selfish one is, the less altruistic one becomes; only by being completely selfless can one be utterly altruistic. Altruism and selfishness are incompatible; selfishness is individualistic thinking, a bourgeois worldview; altruism is communist thinking, a proletarian worldview. In one's mind, these two opposing thoughts of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie cannot "coexist peacefully." Whoever wants to be a successor of the proletariat and do good deeds for the people must first attack "selfishness" and uproot the roots of bourgeois individualism. I decided to discard the thought of "selfishness" and do good deeds again, which made me both conscious and frequent.

	What constitutes "altruism"? There are many nuances to this. Initially, I thought: As long as the other party is happy, it counts as altruism. Later, I gradually understood that the "people" Chairman Mao referred to are the people; "completely selfless, utterly altruistic" means to completely and thoroughly serve the people's interests. Once, when our company helped the villagers repair an irrigation canal, there was a competition between the platoons, and it seemed that other platoons would surpass us. Everyone worked hard to speed up, but neglected the quality. To ensure the quality, I went to the back to make repairs. At this time, the platoon leader called me to quickly go to the front to dig. I thought: Forget it, if the platoon leader wants me to go to the front to speed up, I'll go, so the platoon leader won't be unhappy. But then I thought: If I go to the front, the platoon leader will be satisfied, but when the water is released, if it doesn't flow through, the masses will be dissatisfied. Whose orders should I follow? I thought I should prioritize the interests of the masses. With the platoon leader's approval, I stayed in the back and repaired the irrigation canal to the correct dimensions. At that time, if I had followed the platoon leader's instructions, on the surface, it would seem like obeying the platoon leader, but in reality, it was still for myself to avoid criticism, so it was still not "completely selfless, utterly altruistic." "Completely selfless, utterly altruistic" is a matter of worldview, a fundamental attitude towards all things for a revolutionary. We study this sentence to use the proletarian worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly to transform ourselves; the more thorough the transformation of our worldview, the better we can use this sentence.

    利人和利己是水火不相容的
    北京部队某部班长　解建保
    以前，我对毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导没有正确的理解，往往抱着“利己”的动机去做好事。我刚当副班长的时候，一次，战士王金才腰里长了疮，不能参加训练。我心里挺着急，怕影响班里的成绩。我每一次把病号饭端到他跟前，心里总在想：你连这点小病都不能坚持？脸上露出不耐烦的样子。王金才看透了我的心思。有一天，他对我说：“副班长，我没病了，明天我可以参加训练。”我早就盼望他说这句话了，就高兴地对他说：“行！”接着我又问他吃饭了没有？王金才却反问我：“你们吃饭了没有？”我说：“吃过了。”他说：“我还以为没开饭呢！”这时，我才知道，王金才还没有吃饭。这一天，我只顾班里训练，忘记把病号饭条子送给炊事班。毛主席说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”而我呢？从表面上来看，我盼王金才早日恢复健康、参加训练，是“为了班里的成绩”；其实，是为了自己脸上的“光彩”。表面上看是“利人”，骨子里是利己。这件事，给了我极深刻的教育：为什么我光想到要王金才参加训练，而不想着他的病号饭呢？归根结底，是“利己”心重。
    发生这件事情后，我就比较注意“利人”了，但又舍不得扔掉“利己”，想既“利人”又“利己”。去年，我们在农村搞野营训练，当地社员烧柴有困难。我想：要是抽午睡时间去帮助群众打点柴，既为群众做了好事，又会受到连里表扬，这不是“两全其美”吗？我带着班里的同志，在三个午休时间和一个星期天打了六百多斤柴。可是连里只点名表扬了三班，压根儿没提到我们班的名。我挺纳闷。我们好事也做了，苦也吃了，为什么挂不上“号”呢？当时我总结出一条“经验”：以后做好事一定要看“风向”，一定要打头炮，否则就挂不上“号”，做了也白搭。后来，我反复学习《纪念白求恩》，发觉自己的思想不对头。毛主席批评了这么一种人：“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。”毛主席不正是批评我吗？我给贫下中农打柴，关心的不是群众生活，而是关心自己能不能受到表扬，这不就是“先替自己打算”、“喜欢自吹”吗？这时我想：白求恩、张思德、雷锋等英雄人物所以能够专门利人，是同他们毫不利己分不开的。利己多一分，利人就少一分；只有毫不利己，才能专门利人。利人和利己是水火不相容的，利己是个人主义思想，是资产阶级世界观；利人是共产主义思想，是无产阶级世界观。在一个人的脑子里，无产阶级和资产阶级这两种对立的思想决不能“和平共处”。谁要做无产阶级接班人，为人民做好事，专门利人，就要首先向“利己”开火，挖掉资产阶级个人主义的根子。我下决心扔掉“利己”的思想，再去做好事，就既自觉又经常了。
    怎样才算“利人”呢？这当中也有不少名堂。开始，我以为：不管什么事，只要对方高兴了，就算利人了。后来我逐步弄清楚了，毛主席说的“人”就是人民；“专门利人”，就是完全彻底为人民的利益办事。有一次连队帮助老乡修水渠，各排之间展开了竞赛，眼看别的排进度要超过我们，大家拚命地加快速度，却忽略了质量。为了保证质量，我就在后边进行修理。这时排长叫我赶快到前边去挖。我想：算了，叫到前边赶进度就去吧，省得排长不高兴。可是又一想：到前边去，排长满意了，将来放水时水流不过去，群众就不满意了。到底服从谁呢？我以为应当以人民群众的利益为重。经排长同意，我就留在后边把水渠按尺寸修好。当时如果是照排长的要求去做，表面上是服从排长，实际上还是为了自己免受批评，所以还不是“毫不利己专门利人”。“毫不利己专门利人”，这是一个世界观的问题，是革命者对待一切事物的根本态度问题。我们学习这一句话，就是要用全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观改造自己；世界观改造得越彻底，这句话就用得越好。
