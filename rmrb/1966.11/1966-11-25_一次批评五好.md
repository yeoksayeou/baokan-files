After a live-fire shooting exercise, I casually wiped my gun a few times and was about to go out and play. Just as I took a couple of steps out, the platoon leader called me back, pointing at my gun and saying, "You haven't wiped it clean yet!" I used my sleeve to wipe the gunstock and was about to walk away again. The platoon leader criticized me, saying, "You shouldn't be so lazy. Use a cloth to wipe the inside and outside of the gun again. Look, the other comrades in the platoon are all wiping their guns carefully." Hearing this, I became unhappy. I thought: I've been a soldier for over a year, and my gun has always been clean. Today, I'm being asked to wipe it again. This is clearly picking on me and hurting my face.

That night, I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. I thought about the platoon leader's criticism and about how other comrades could apply what they learned from Chairman Mao's works, but I couldn't. Chairman Mao said, "Since we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism and correction." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I should accept criticism, correct my mistakes, and not do otherwise. I realized that during the day, I had argued with the platoon leader and hadn't wiped the gun again. The gun is a soldier's second life; wiping it carelessly is irresponsible to the revolutionary cause. What's more, not listening to criticism and thinking it hurts my face is a reflection of bourgeois vanity. I was wrong. So, I first apologized to the platoon leader and admitted my shortcomings.

Since then, I have repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and applied what I learned. Towards criticism, I have adopted the attitude of correcting mistakes if there are any and striving to improve if there are none. This way, my shortcomings are corrected quickly, and my progress is fast. At the beginning of this year, I was rated as a Five Good Soldier.

    一次批评五好
    战士　彭良贤
    实弹射击回来，我随手擦了几下枪就想跑出去耍。刚朝外走两步，班长就叫我转来，指着我的枪说：“你还没有擦干净啊！”我用袖子把枪托擦了一下，开步又要走。班长就批评我说：“不应该图简单，你用油布把枪里里外外重新擦一次。你看，班里同志都在认真地擦呀！”听到这里，我就不高兴了。心想：我当了一年多兵，擦的枪都要得，今天要我重新擦一次，这分明是找我的麻烦，伤我的面子。
    晚上，我躺在床上翻来复去睡不着，想起班长的批评，想到其他同志学了毛主席著作都能用，我就用得不好。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”依照毛主席这个教导，我应该听得进批评，错了就改，不这样就是没有听毛主席的话。想到白天顶撞班长，没有重新擦枪；枪是革命战士的第二条生命，马马虎虎地擦，就是对革命工作不负责任，这不是缺点是什么？更错的是不听别人批评，认为伤了自己的面子，这是资产阶级虚荣心的反映。是我错了。于是，我首先找班长道了歉，承认了自己的缺点。
    从那以后，我反复学习了“老三篇”，学一点用一点。对于批评，抱着有则改之，无则加勉的态度。这样，缺点改正得快，进步也快，今年初评为五好战士。
