Tanzanian people are determined to sweep away all enemies with an iron broom. President Nyerere and Vice President Karume condemn foreign forces plotting conspiracies. Students in Dar es Salaam and other places stage demonstrations to counter imperialist provocations.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on October 31, in recent days, people from various parts of Tanzania have been holding demonstrations and rallies. Various organizations and newspapers have issued statements and comments, strongly condemning the imperialists for inciting a portion of university students to oppose the government's reasonable proposal for university graduates to join the national service corps.

On October 22, in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam, more than 300 university students marched against the government's national service corps plan. Witnesses said that at the beginning of the march, an American professor joined the queue to incite the crowd.

Facing the new conspiracies of imperialism, thousands of Tanzanian youth who support the government held a grand demonstration the next day (October 23) in Dar es Salaam to counter the provocations of the imperialist elements. President Nyerere, in his speech at the rally, accused the previous day's march of being "planned by a certain foreign country." When talking about some students holding reactionary placards that read "Life under colonial rule was better than now," he said, "This statement sounds like it was made by foreigners; it is the advocacy of some bad people, big exploiters, and bloodsuckers." Such ideas "cannot come from our youth, but must come from elsewhere." He also strongly condemned the British Broadcasting Corporation for deliberately exaggerating the student incident.

On the same day, 700 members of the national service corps marched from their camp to the State House to express their support for President Nyerere and the national service corps plan.

Meanwhile, thousands of people carrying placards reading "One hand with a gun, one hand with a hoe, building the nation" held a march in Zanzibar.

First Vice President Karume, while reviewing the marching crowd, declared, "Tanzanians are determined never to be ruled by imperialism again."

In these days, in Tanga port and near the southern border of Tanganyika in Mbeya, thousands of students, soldiers, and others held marches in support of the government.

The Tanganyika African National Union issued a statement on October 27 saying that the student incident on October 22 "must have been instigated by the enemies of this country."

It called on President Nyerere to "sweep away all open and hidden enemies with an iron broom."

The Tanganyika Federation of Labor, the Youth League of the Tanganyika African National Union, and the Youth Department of the African-Asian Party have also passed resolutions or issued statements expressing their full support for the national service corps plan.

The *Uhuru* newspaper published an editorial on October 25 saying that the instigators of this incident must be exposed and expelled from Tanzania. The editorial called on the Tanzanian government to use a "microscope" to investigate all educational institutions, especially foreign teachers, such as those from the American "Peace Corps." It was reported that since Tanzania's independence, the United States has used various means to infiltrate the country, and now there are about 400 members of the American "Peace Corps" in Tanzania.

According to reports, the national service corps was established after Tanzania's independence. Its purpose is to promote the spirit of anti-colonialism and self-reliance among Tanzanian youth, and to actively participate in the construction of the motherland. Previously, it was voluntary for youth to join. Recently, the Tanzanian National Assembly approved the government's proposal that all university graduates and students who have left school should serve in the national service corps for two years.

    坦桑尼亚人民决心用铁扫帚扫除一切敌人
    尼雷尔总统卡鲁姆副总统谴责外国势力策划阴谋活动
    达累斯萨拉姆等地学生示威反击帝国主义分子的挑衅
    据新华社三十一日讯　达累斯萨拉姆消息：连日来，坦桑尼亚各地人民不断举行示威集会，各团体和报刊也纷纷发表声明和评论，强烈谴责帝国主义者唆使一部分大学生反对政府关于大学毕业生参加国民服务队的合理建议。
    十月二十二日，在坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆，曾发生了三百多名大学生游行，反对政府关于国民服务队计划的事件。据目击者说，在游行开始时，曾有一美国籍的教授随队煽动。
    面临帝国主义新的阴谋活动，拥护政府的数千名坦桑尼亚青年学生在第二天（二十三日）就在达累斯萨拉姆举行了盛大的示威，对帝国主义分子的挑衅进行了必要的反击。尼雷尔总统在大会上讲话，指责头一天发生的游行是“某一个外国策划的”。他在谈到某些学生竟拿着“在殖民主义者统治下的生活比现在的还要好”的反动标语牌时说：“这句话听起来就是外国人讲的，这是一些坏人、大剥削者和吸血鬼的主张。”这种思想“不可能来源于我们的青年，只能来源于别的地方”。他还强烈地谴责了英国广播公司有意渲染这次学生闹事事件。
    同一天，有七百名国民服务队队员从他们的营地列队前往国家大厦表示支持尼雷尔总统，支持国民服务队计划。
    与此同时，数千人拿着写有“一手拿枪，一手拿锄，建设国家”的标语牌，在桑给巴尔举行游行。
    第一副总统卡鲁姆在检阅游行队伍时宣布：“坦桑尼亚人决心永远不再受帝国主义的统治。”
    这几天，在坦噶尼喀的坦加港口和南部边境附近的姆巴亚，也有数千名学生、军人等举行了支持政府的游行。
    坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟二十七日发表声明说，二十二日学生闹事“必定是这个国家的敌人所煽起的”。
    它要求尼雷尔总统“用铁扫帚扫除一切公开和隐蔽的敌人”。
    坦噶尼喀工人全国联合会、坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟青年团、非洲—设拉子党青年部等组织，也已作出决议或发表声明，表示完全支持国家的国民服务队计划。
    《自由报》为这件事在二十五日发表社论说，必须把这次事件的煽动者揪出来，赶出坦桑尼亚。社论要求坦桑尼亚政府用“显微镜”对一切教育机构，特别是外籍教师，例如对来自美国“和平队”的教师进行调查。据报道，自坦桑尼亚独立后，美国即用种种方式向这个国家进行渗透，现在在坦桑尼亚的美国“和平队”队员约有四百人。
    据报道，国民服务队是坦桑尼亚独立后设立的。目的是为了促进坦桑尼亚青年反抗殖民主义的精神和自力更生精神，积极投入祖国的建设。以前是由青年自愿参加的。最近，坦桑尼亚国民议会批准了政府的建议：全国所有大学毕业生和已离校的学生都应在国民服务队服务两年。
