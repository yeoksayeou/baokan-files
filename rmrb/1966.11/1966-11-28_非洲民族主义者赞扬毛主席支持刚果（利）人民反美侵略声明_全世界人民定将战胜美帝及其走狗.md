African nationalists praise Chairman Mao's statement supporting the Congolese (L) people's anti-American aggression
All the people of the world will surely defeat American imperialism and its running dogs

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, November 27th: On the eve of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao Zedong's "Statement in Support of the Congolese (L) People's Struggle Against American Aggression," the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) Propaganda and News Secretary Moret here told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao's statement is not only an encouragement to the Congolese (L) people but also to the people of Azania."

	He said, "As Chairman Mao pointed out two years ago in his statement, 'Every place the United States invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck.'"

	"Events that have occurred since the statement was issued indicate that U.S. imperialism, which has its hands all over the world, is doomed to complete failure. It is not as strong as it appears."

	He went on to say, "The Congolese people will ultimately enjoy the fruits of their struggle and realize their aspirations, which have been expressed by their brave and beloved leader Lumumba."

	He emphasized, "U.S. imperialism and its puppet regimes imposed on the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America will ultimately be overthrown by the revolutionary peoples of the world."

	On November 26th, the chief representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union, Chihuta, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter here, "We fully agree with and support Chairman Mao's 'Statement in Support of the Congolese (L) People's Struggle Against American Aggression.'"

	He condemned the evil crimes committed by U.S. imperialism around the world and emphasized that the liberation war being waged by the people of Zimbabwe is not only against the Smith regime but also against the imperialists, including the United States and Britain, who support this regime.

	Pointing to the last paragraph of Chairman Mao's statement, he told the reporter, "Chairman Mao said: 'If the people of the world have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, are not afraid of difficulties, and advance wave upon wave, then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed.' He said this teaching is very important. In Zimbabwe, no matter what tricks the imperialists play, victory will belong to the people of Zimbabwe who are determined to defend their homeland."

	He said, "The Johnson administration in the United States should know that 'before U.S. imperialism stops its aggression against Africa and Asia, and before the peoples of the two continents can freely control their own destinies, the people of Zimbabwe and Africa will never lay down their weapons.'"

	On November 26th, the representative of the All-African Trade Union Federation in East and Central Africa, the famous Tanzanian trade union worker Zimbihili, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao's 'Statement in Support of the Congolese (L) People's Struggle Against American Aggression' is also a support for the workers of other African countries in their struggle against U.S. imperialism."

	He said, "African workers value Chairman Mao's teaching that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. U.S. imperialism is doomed to complete failure because the progressive peoples of the world oppose its policy of oppression and aggression. He stressed that the days of U.S. imperialism are numbered."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, November 27th: On November 26th, John Mokone, the permanent representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Algiers, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the Congolese (L) People's Struggle Against American Aggression": "Chairman Mao's statement 'was, is, and will be a powerful weapon for all revolutionary fighters in the world in their struggle against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism to achieve national independence.'"

	Mokone praised Chairman Mao's insightful statement that "every place the United States invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck." He said, "From what has happened in Africa, Asia, and Latin America over the past two years, this is very correct." He also said, "The number one enemy of the peoples of the world, U.S. imperialism, is being surrounded by the peoples of the countries that are fighting."

	Mokone finally emphasized: "We are convinced that the peoples of the world will surely defeat all dark forces led by U.S. imperialism."

    非洲民族主义者赞扬毛主席支持刚果（利）人民反美侵略声明
    全世界人民定将战胜美帝及其走狗
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十七日电　在毛泽东主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表两周年的前夕，阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会宣传和新闻书记莫雷特在这里对新华社记者发表谈话说，毛主席的这个声明“不仅是对刚果（利）人民的鼓励，也是对阿扎尼亚人民的鼓励”。
    他说：“正如毛主席两年前在声明中所指出的那样，美国每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。”“自从声明发表以来的这一段时期发生的事件表明，美帝国主义把手伸向全世界，注定要遭到彻底失败，它不是像看起来的样子那么强大。”
    他接着说：“刚果人民最终将享受他们斗争的成果和实现他们的愿望，这些愿望已由他们的果敢和受人爱戴的领袖卢蒙巴表达出来。”
    他强调指出：“美帝国主义及其强加给非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民的傀儡，终将被世界革命人民打倒。”
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟首席代表契胡塔二十六日在这里对新华社记者发表谈话说：“我们完全同意和支持毛主席的《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》。”
    他谴责美帝国主义在全世界犯下的罪恶暴行，并且强调指出，津巴布韦人民进行的解放战争，不仅是反对史密斯殖民主义政权，也是反对支持这个政权的美英等帝国主义者的。
    他指着毛主席这个声明的最后一段对记者说，毛主席指出：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”他说，这一教导非常重要。在津巴布韦，不管帝国主义干什么勾当，胜利必属于决心保卫祖国的津巴布韦人民。
    他说，美国约翰逊政府应该知道，“在美帝国主义停止对非洲和亚洲的侵略之前，在两大洲的人民能自由地掌握自己的命运之前，津巴布韦和非洲人民决不会放下他们手中的武器”。
    全非工会联合会驻东非和中非地区代表、坦桑尼亚著名的工会工作者津比希利二十六日对新华社记者发表谈话说，毛主席的《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》，也是对非洲其它国家工人反对美帝国主义斗争的支持。
    他说，非洲工人重视毛主席关于美帝国主义是纸老虎的教导。美帝国主义注定要彻底失败，因为全世界进步人民反对它的压迫和侵略政策。他强调说，美帝国主义的寿命不长了。
    据新华社阿尔及尔二十七日电　阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会常驻阿尔及尔的代表约翰·莫科内二十六日就毛主席发表《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》两周年向新华社记者发表谈话指出：毛主席的声明“过去是，现在是，将来也是全世界一切革命战士从事反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，取得民族独立的斗争的有力武器。”
    莫科内赞扬毛主席关于美帝国主义每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上的英明论断。他说，从非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲过去两年来发生的事情来看，这是非常正确的。他还说，全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义正在被进行斗争的各国人民包围起来。
    莫科内最后强调说：我们深信全世界人民定将战胜以美帝国主义为首的一切黑暗势力。
