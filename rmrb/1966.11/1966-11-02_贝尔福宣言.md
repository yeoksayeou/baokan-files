Forty-nine years ago today, Britain manufactured the Balfour Declaration to maintain its colonial rule in Palestine.

Palestine is located in the western part of Asia, on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and is a crucial transportation hub for Europe, Asia, and Africa, holding significant strategic and economic importance. The local residents are predominantly Arabs, with a portion being Jews. During World War I, Palestine was occupied by Britain.

On November 2, 1917, British Foreign Secretary Balfour wrote to the Zionist Federation stating that the British government supported "the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine." British imperialism aimed to incite a national conflict between Arabs and Jews to achieve its goal of ruling Palestine. This declaration was acknowledged by the United States in 1918.

After World War II, the United States manipulated the United Nations to pass a resolution for the partition of Palestine and supported the establishment of the "State of Israel" by the Jews. This action is a direct continuation of the Balfour Declaration.

    “贝尔福宣言”
    四十九年前的今天，英国制造了一个在巴勒斯坦维护其殖民统治的“贝尔福宣言”。
    巴勒斯坦在亚洲西部、地中海东岸，是欧亚非三洲的交通枢纽，具有重要的战略和经济地位。当地居民大部分是阿拉伯人，一部分是犹太人。第一次世界大战期间，巴勒斯坦被英国占领。
    一九一七年十一月二日，英国外交大臣贝尔福写信通知犹太复国主义者联盟说，英国政府赞同“在巴勒斯坦由犹太人建立民族家园”。英帝国主义企图借以挑起阿拉伯人和犹太人之间的民族纠纷，以达到它统治巴勒斯坦的目的。这个宣言，在一九一八年得到美国的承认。
    第二次大战以后，美国操纵联合国通过巴勒斯坦分治的决议，又支持犹太人成立了“以色列”国。这种做法和“贝尔福宣言”正是一脉相承的。
