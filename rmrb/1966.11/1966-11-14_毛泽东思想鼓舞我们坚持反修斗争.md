November 10, 1966, was the happiest day of our lives. On this day, we sixty-five students who were unjustly ordered to return to China by the Soviet government, saw our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. At this unforgettable moment, our sixty-five joyful hearts seemed to leap out of our chests. With tears of joy, we raised high the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted with all our might, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" Even shouting a thousand times, ten thousand times, we could not express the joy in our hearts, nor could we express our love for the great leader.

Recalling the days we spent studying in the Soviet Union, we were surrounded by anti-China clamor everywhere. The Soviet revisionists subjected us to various forms of persecution and harassment. It was Chairman Mao who gave us the boundless strength to struggle. When the Soviet revisionist leadership ordered us to return to China, many foreign friends told us, "Although you were unjustly expelled, you have a powerful motherland behind you, and you have Mao Zedong. This is your pride!" Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in the hearts of the people of the world. The revolutionary people of the Soviet Union and the students from Asia, Africa, and Latin America want us to convey their admiration and greetings to you.

When we were struggling against the Soviet revisionists, because we had Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we were full of confidence and dared to fight and dare to advance. When the revisionists fired sugar-coated bullets at us, trying to corrupt us in our thoughts and lives, because we had Chairman Mao's teachings, we were a hundred times more vigilant, making them find no opportunity, no gap to exploit. Every time we read Chairman Mao's books, we felt an endless warmth in our hearts, and our bodies were filled with strength. We understand: with Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing; we dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea!

After returning to the motherland, we saw that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, was advancing with the momentum of a thunderstorm. Under Chairman Mao's great call of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," the whole country was full of vigorous revolutionary scenes, and industry and agriculture achieved brilliant results. All this made us overjoyed.

We hail the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The concern of hundreds of millions of people for state affairs has given us great encouragement and education. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, who always believes in the masses and relies on the masses, always lets the masses liberate themselves and educate themselves. Great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is excellent. Our country will definitely prosper even more. In the Soviet Union under the rule of the revisionists, fascist terror pervades everywhere, and even anti-American demonstrations are brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionist police. Many revolutionary comrades suffer persecution. Comparing the situation in the Soviet Union, we feel even more the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought.

We are determined to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must definitely care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    毛泽东思想鼓舞我们坚持反修斗争
    一九六六年十一月十日，是我们一生中最幸福的日子。这一天，我们六十五名被苏联政府无理勒令回国的留学生，见到了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。在这难忘的时刻，我们六十五颗欢乐的心都要跳出来了，我们含着欢乐的热泪，高举着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，尽情地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”一千遍，一万遍，也喊不出我们内心的喜悦，也表达不出我们对伟大领袖的热爱。
    回想起我们在苏联学习的日子里，到处是反华叫嚣，苏修对我们进行了种种迫害和刁难，在这种情况下，是毛主席给了我们斗争的无穷力量。当苏修领导集团勒令我们回国时，很多外国朋友对我们说：“你们虽然被无理赶走，但你们身后有强大的祖国，你们有毛泽东，这是你们的骄傲！”毛主席啊毛主席，您是全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳，革命的苏联人民和亚、非、拉留学生，要我们转达对您的敬仰和问候。
    在我们同苏修进行斗争的时候，因为有毛泽东思想作为武器，我们就信心百倍，敢斗敢闯；当修正主义者向我们发射糖衣炮弹，在思想和生活上腐蚀我们的时候，因为有毛主席的教导，我们就百倍警惕，使他们无机可乘，无孔可钻。每当我们读毛主席的书，心里总感到无限温暖，浑身充满了力量。我们懂得：有了毛泽东思想，就什么都不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯！
    回到祖国以后，看到了毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，正以雷霆万钧之势，向前发展；在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，全国到处是蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象，工农业生产取得了辉煌成果。这一切，怎不叫人心花怒放？
    我们欢呼以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。亿万群众这样关心国家大事，给了我们很大鼓舞和教育。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，这样相信群众，依靠群众，始终是让群众自己解放自己，自己教育自己。无产阶级专政条件下的大民主好得很，我们的国家必定会更加兴旺起来。在修正主义者统治下的苏联，法西斯恐怖到处笼罩，连反美游行示威也遭到苏修军警残酷的镇压。许多革命志士遭受迫害。对比苏联现状，我们更体会到毛泽东思想的伟大。
    我们决心读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我们一定要关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    被苏联政府无理勒令回国的全体留学生
