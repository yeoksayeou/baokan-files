	Struggling with "Hardship" Brings Endless Joy
	Deputy Commander of a Division in the Guangzhou Military Region, Hao Zhongyun

	Chairman Mao teaches us: When attacking the enemy, one must have a main direction. Choosing the right breakthrough point is essential for advancing and annihilating the enemy. I think that ideological transformation is similar to warfare; it also needs a main direction. What is the main direction for my ideological transformation? I listed my ideological issues and found that the biggest enemy is the desire for comfort and the weakening of fighting spirit. To attack this enemy, one must actively seek out hardship and charge towards the "hardship."

	In Peacetime, One Must Endure Hardship as in Wartime

	Hardship in wartime is harsh; whether you want it or not, you have to endure it. Hardship in peacetime is soft; if you don't want it, you can avoid it. The question is whether to avoid hardship or actively seek it out. This is a test of one's fighting spirit. Let me give a small example: every time we march, do we walk with the soldiers or ride a horse or sit in a car? Especially when we reach the end, when our legs are so tired they can hardly move, our minds start to struggle. But I think: if we were in battle, could we still command while riding a horse? Commanding from a car? As soon as I think of this, I always walk with the soldiers. The more tired and painful it is, the more I do not ride a horse or sit in a car. Once, the unit was marching in the mountains in several columns and encountered a steep cliff. Should we go down or not? I thought, if this were a battle, the enemy would be escaping. Could we not go down? So, I went down with my comrades. The cliff was over two hundred meters high, and with every step, my legs trembled. But as soon as I thought of the battle and the need to annihilate the enemy, I found the courage.

	Compared to wartime, there are fewer opportunities to endure hardship in peacetime. Every time I get the chance, I do not let it pass. Last year, we conducted a military field training exercise in the tropical mountainous jungle. I also participated. On the first day, I put on my backpack, took an axe, and led the way, cutting through the forest. The dense forest was hot and humid, and I sweated profusely, almost fainting from heatstroke. My legs felt weak, and the sky and earth seemed to spin. I vaguely thought of many things: I remembered marching to the southwest, where I had malaria for two months and still had to march while sick and fight the enemy. I remember one day when our company captured thirteen hilltops, and I did not feel the hardship. What is this little hardship compared to that? In this way, I did not lie down. To encourage my comrades to overcome difficulties, I rolled up my sleeves and led everyone in singing. When we reached the campsite, I went up the mountain to cut wood for a shelter to sleep in. I cut over a hundred pounds of wood and carried it down the mountain. My legs trembled, and several times I wanted to drop it, but as soon as I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," I felt energized. When I came down, I saw that the shelter lacked a crossbeam, so I went back up to cut down a tree and carried it down.

	I actively sought out hardship and fought against it, gradually forming the idea: compared to wartime, peacetime hardship is ultimately minor. However, only by enduring small hardships in peacetime can one endure great hardships in wartime. Confronting and overcoming small hardships prepares one for facing and overcoming great hardships. Enduring small hardships is preparation for enduring great hardships. Not fearing hardship in peacetime means not fearing death in wartime. Sweating more in peacetime means bleeding less in wartime.

	Leaders Must Endure Hardship Like Soldiers

	As my position changed, I became a higher-ranking officer, and my work became busier. Should I still endure hardship like the soldiers? One day, I went to the Fifth Company to participate in shooting training. It was raining heavily. The soldiers were lying in the mud practicing aiming. I was wearing a new uniform and was about to lie down when the soldiers quickly pulled me up and held an umbrella over me. This incident made me think deeply. On one hand, it shows the soldiers' care for their leaders; on the other hand, it also shows that in the soldiers' minds, I am no longer an ordinary soldier. This made me alert. I repeatedly pondered Chairman Mao's words: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." Chairman Mao's words once again pointed out the direction for me. I thought, can I eliminate the sense of privilege in my mind? This is the key to being an ordinary soldier. To continue to maintain the spirit of an ordinary soldier, one must endure hardship like a soldier. Enduring hardship is not a small matter; it is a big matter of strengthening proletarian feelings, preventing peaceful evolution, and maintaining fighting spirit. As my awareness improved, my initiative to endure hardship also increased. Afterwards, whenever I went to the company, I tried to appear as an ordinary soldier. Whatever the soldiers did, I did; whatever hardship the soldiers endured, I endured. Wherever it was most difficult, I strove to go there.

	Enduring hardship like a soldier is not just a matter of willpower and courage; there is also ideological struggle. Once, I went to the Sixth Company for a work assignment and spent the whole day crawling and rolling with the soldiers. When I returned, I indeed felt sore and tired. During mealtime, a soldier brought a stool for me. Should I sit or not? If I did not sit, standing to eat was tiring; if I sat, seeing the soldiers all standing, how could I be special? When I thought that this was a test of my fighting spirit, I resolutely overcame the desire for comfort. I deeply felt that being a deputy commander is easy, but being an ordinary soldier forever is truly difficult. In daily life in the company, I encountered such small matters. How to face these small matters, whether to actively endure these hardships, is a critical point in ideological transformation. If there is even a hint of "officialdom" in one's mind, it is easy to forgive oneself and not be a good ordinary soldier. As one's thoughts and feelings drift further from the soldiers, it will be difficult to lead the soldiers into battle in the future.

	Even as One Ages, One Must Endure Hardship Like in Youth

	As the years pass, if one does not correctly face this, it is easy to foster thoughts of fearing hardship, fearing fatigue, and desiring comfort. Once, after a field training exercise, I felt sore and tired and thought: this might be a natural phenomenon, and in the future, I will no longer be able to endure hardship like in my youth. But I immediately realized: this is forgiving oneself and yielding to difficulties. Our great leader Chairman Mao, at over seventy years old, worked day and night for the Chinese people and the people of the world, crossing the Yangtze River again and again to open a path for the youth. Compared to Chairman Mao, I am always a child. How can I age prematurely? I must resolutely fight against the "old" and the thoughts of fearing hardship and fatigue.

	Later, I led a battalion of soldiers to conduct shooting training in the mountains. I decided to test myself to see if I could still climb mountains and fight with the soldiers. On the first day, I climbed the mountain and did not feel very tired, which made me happy. On the second day, my legs swelled and hurt badly. My blood pressure was also high, and I vomited while climbing. Should I lie down and rest for a few days? I thought, I am leading the unit for training, and if the unit climbs the mountain, I lie down, how can this be? In my youth, I never left the unit and always charged with the soldiers. Now, although my age has changed, my fighting spirit cannot change. My legs hurt for seven days, and I insisted on climbing the mountain for seven days. Every day, after coming down, I studied Chairman Mao's works, and the more I studied, the more energy I had. In the end, after more than two months of mountain climbing training, my legs were trained, my blood pressure dropped, and my fighting spirit became stronger. The facts prove: the idea that one cannot endure hardship like a soldier because of old age is groundless. This is not just physical decline; the important thing is the decline of fighting spirit. In the process of continuously struggling against the thought of fearing hardship, I gradually came to the conclusion: aging is a natural law, but aging in thought is not. Revolutionary willpower is strong, and even if one is old in age, one's thoughts will not age; if revolutionary willpower is not strong, even if one is young in age, one will age prematurely. As a revolutionary soldier, no matter how old one is, one should always maintain a strong revolutionary spirit and fight for the world revolution for life.

	Even as Living Conditions Improve, One Must Endure Hardship Like in Difficult Times

	As living conditions improve, should one still endure hardship like in the past? I know: frugality in life is the first line of defense against political decline. However, under the influence of bourgeois ideology, sometimes thoughts of desiring comfort still arise. When encountering such situations, I reread a passage from Chairman Mao's "On the Coalition Government": "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person's heart ache when thinking of them. Can we still not sacrifice personal interests and abandon errors?" Reading Chairman Mao's words, the martyrs who sacrificed their lives appeared one by one before my eyes. Our old company commander, Lyu Fuhai, lived a life of such frugality and simplicity, giving his coat to the soldier on duty at night. In the battles of three descents into the south in Northeast China, he ran at the head of the company, shouting, "Annihilate the enemy and liberate the suffering people!" This voice still echoes in my ears today. Our old platoon leader lived the most frugally; his only "possession" was an old coat seized from the enemy. In the winter of 1946, during a battle, he unfortunately sacrificed his life. At the time of his sacrifice, he still stood upright in the snow, pointing at the enemy. For the cause of people's liberation, countless martyrs contributed their lives. We, the living, should think of them. Even if we have only a hint of the thought of desiring comfort, it is shameful. No matter how much the living standards improve, one should always follow Chairman Mao's words and strive to be frugal forever. In good conditions, one must not forget the hard days of the past. In personal life, one must constantly struggle against the thought of desiring comfort. I gradually came to the realization: as living conditions improve from bad to good, it is easy to forget hardship. I often use the method of reminiscence and comparison to warn myself: the better the life, the more one should not forget the past hardships. Enduring one more bit of hardship makes the fighting spirit ten times stronger; enduring one less bit of hardship makes the fighting spirit ten times weaker.

	Struggling through hardship is our party's fine tradition, and enduring hardship is the greatest characteristic of the people's army. This is our strength and the enemy's weakness. The U.S. imperialists and all reactionaries fear this the most. We must firmly establish a worldview of the proletariat that fears no hardship, fears no death, and is dedicated to the people and the revolution. Only by passing the test of not fearing hardship can one remain calm and composed in the face of life and death.

### 与“苦”奋斗　其乐无穷

    与“苦”奋斗　其乐无穷
    广州部队某部副师长　郝忠云
    毛主席教导我们：向敌人进攻要有个主攻方向。选择好突破口，才能向纵深发展，全歼敌人。我想，思想改造也和打仗一样，要有个主攻方向。什么是我思想改造的主攻方向呢？我把思想问题一排队，发现最大的敌人就是贪图安逸，战斗意志开始松懈。要向这个敌人进攻，就要主动找“苦”吃，向“苦”字冲锋。
    和平时期要像战争时期一样吃苦
    战争时期的苦是硬的，想吃也得吃，不想吃也得吃；和平时期的苦是软的，不想吃可以避开。是想法避苦，还是主动找苦吃？这是对一个人的战斗意志的考验。举件小事来说，每次行军，是和战士一起走呢，还是骑马、坐车呢？特别是走到最后，两条腿拉不开大栓了，思想就斗争起来。但是我想：打起仗来，还能骑着马指挥？坐着车指挥？一想到这里，我总是和战士们一起走路，越苦越累，越到节骨眼上，越不骑马、坐车。有一次，部队在大山上分几路穿林行军，遇到了一个陡壁。下去不下去呢？我想，如果是战斗，敌人就要逃走，能不下去吗？于是，我便和同志们一起下去了。陡壁有两百多米高，每下一步腿都发颤。但是一想到战斗，要消灭敌人，就有了勇气。
    平时和战时比，吃苦的机会少，每有一次机会，我都不放过。去年，我们在热带山岳丛林里搞了一次军事野营。我也参加了。头一天，我就背起背包，拿把砍刀，在前面砍林开路。大森林里，天气闷热，出汗太多，有些中暑。走路时脚下发软，天也转，地也转，真想躺下。我迷迷糊糊地想了许多事情：想起进军西南的时候，自己打了两个月“摆子”，一直带病行军，还要和敌人打仗。记得有一天，我们一连攻下了十三个山头，也不觉得苦。眼前这点困难又算得了什么？就这样，自己到底没有躺下。为了鼓起同志们克服困难的勇气，我还挽起袖子，指挥大家唱起歌来。到了宿营地，我就上山砍木棍搭棚睡觉，砍了一百多斤，扛起来往山下走，腿就发颤，几次都想扔下不扛了，可是一想到毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”浑身就来了劲。下来一看，棚子缺根横梁，我又上去砍了棵树扛下来。
    我这样一次一次地主动找“苦”吃，和“苦”斗，逐渐明确了一个想法：平时的苦和战时比较，终究是小苦。但是，只有平时和小苦斗，战时才能和大苦斗。见小苦就上、就斗，就去战胜它，遇到大苦就能把它踩在脚下，吃小苦正是为吃大苦作准备。平时不怕苦，战时就不怕死。平时多流汗，战时才能少流血。
    当干部要像当战士一样吃苦
    随着职务的变化，干部越当越大了，工作也越来越忙了，还要不要和战士一样的吃苦呢？有一天，我到五连参加射击训练，正下着大雨。战士们趴在泥水里练瞄准。我穿着新军装，刚要趴下去，战士们赶紧把我拉住，还给我打起雨伞。这件事，引起了我的深思。这一方面说明战士对干部的爱护；另方面也说明我在战士心目中，已经不是一个普通一兵了。这使我警惕起来。我反复思考着毛主席这样一段话：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”毛主席的话，又一次给我指明了方向。我想，能不能打掉思想上的特殊感，是能不能做一个普通一兵的关键。而要继续保持普通一兵的本色，就要像战士一样的吃苦。吃苦决不是一件小事，而是增强无产阶级感情的大事，是防止和平演变、保持战斗意志的大事。认识提高了，主动吃苦的自觉性也提高了。以后我下到连队，就努力以普通一兵的身份出现。战士干啥我干啥，战士吃什么苦，我也吃什么苦。哪里最艰苦，我就争取到哪里去。
    和战士一样吃苦，不仅是个毅力和勇气的问题，这中间也有思想斗争。有一次，我去六连蹲点，和战士们成天摸爬滚打在一起，回来的确有些腰酸腿痛了。吃饭的时候，战士给我搬来了凳子。坐不坐呢？不坐吧，站着吃真累；坐吧，一看到战士都是站着吃，自己怎么好特殊呢？当我想到这是考验自己的战斗意志的时候，就坚决克服了贪图安逸的思想。我深深体会到：当个副师长容易，永远当个普通一兵可真难。在连队日常生活中，遇到的就是这样一些小事。用什么态度去对待这些小事，愿不愿意去主动吃这些苦，这是思想革命化的一道关口。脑子里稍微有点“官气”，就很容易原谅自己，就当不好普通一兵。思想感情离开战士越来越远，将来打起仗来，就难于带领战士冲锋陷阵了。
    年纪大了也要像年轻时一样不怕吃苦
    年纪一年比一年大，如果不能正确对待，也容易助长自己怕苦、怕累、贪图安逸的思想。有一次野营后，自己感到腰酸腿痛，就想：这可能是自然现象，以后再也不会像年轻力壮的时候那样能吃苦了。但是，我马上又意识到：这是原谅自己，向困难低头。我们伟大的领袖毛主席，他老人家七十多岁了，为中国人民、世界人民日夜操劳，还一次又一次地横渡长江，为青年人开辟航道。和毛主席比较起来，我永远是个小孩子，怎么能未老先衰呢？我要坚决向“老”字斗，向怕苦怕累的思想斗。
    后来，我带着一个营的战士在大山上搞射击训练。我决心试一试，看看自己还能不能和战士一起爬山打仗。第一天，我爬上了山，感到不怎么累，心里很高兴。第二天，腿肿起来了，疼得厉害。我的血压又高，上山还呕吐。要不要躺下来休息几天呢？我想，我是带领部队来搞训练的，部队上山，我躺下来，这怎么行呢？年轻的时候，自己从来不肯离开部队，总是和战士们一起打冲锋。现在，年纪虽然有了变化，但战斗意志不能变。我的腿疼了七天，坚持爬了七天的山。每天下来，我就学习毛主席著作，越学越觉得有劲。最后，经过两个多月的登山训练，我的腿练出来了，血压还降低了，战斗意志也坚强起来了。事实证明：认为年纪“老”了，就不能和战士一样吃苦的想法，是没有根据的。这不全是体力衰退了，重要的是战斗意志衰退了。在不断和怕苦思想作斗争的过程中，我逐渐得出了一个看法：人的年纪大是自然规律，年老思想不老，则是无产阶级革命者的规律。革命意志旺盛，年纪再大，思想也不会老；革命意志不旺，就是年纪不大，也会未老先衰。作为一个革命战士，无论到了什么年纪，都应该保持旺盛的革命斗志，为世界革命斗争一辈子。
    生活条件好了也要像艰苦时一样吃苦
    生活条件越来越好了，还要不要像过去一样的吃苦呢？我知道：生活上艰苦朴素，是防止政治衰退的第一道防线。但是，在资产阶级思想的影响下，有时还会闪现出贪图舒服的念头。遇到这种情况，我就重新读《论联合政府》里毛主席的一段话：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”读着毛主席的话，牺牲了的老战友就一个一个地出现在我的眼前。我们的老连长吕福海同志，个人生活是那样艰苦朴素，夜里，把自己的大衣送给站哨的战士穿。在东北三下江南的战斗中，他跑在全连的最前边，一面冲锋，一面向战士们喊：“消灭敌人，解放受苦人民！”这声音一直到今天还留在我的耳朵里。我们的老排长，生活最艰苦，他仅有的“财产”，就是从敌人手里缴获来的一件旧大衣。一九四六年冬天，在一次战斗中，他不幸牺牲了。牺牲时，他还挺立在雪地里，手指着敌人。为了人民的解放事业，无数先烈贡献出了自己的生命。我们活着的人，只要一想到他们，哪怕是只有一点贪图舒服的念头，都是可耻的。不管生活水平怎么提高，自己都应该听毛主席的话，一定要永远艰苦奋斗。在好条件下，更不能忘掉过去的苦日子。在个人生活上，不断向贪图安逸的思想作斗争，我渐渐得出这样的体会：生活条件由差到好，往往容易忘记艰苦。我经常采取回忆对比的方法来警惕自己：生活越好，越不能忘记过去的苦。多吃一分苦，斗志就旺盛十分，少吃一分苦，斗志就减少十分。
    艰苦奋斗是我们党的优良传统，吃苦耐劳是人民军队的最大特点。这是我们的特长，是敌人的特短。美帝国主义和一切反动派最怕我们这一招。我们一定要牢固树立一不怕苦、二不怕死、一心为人民、一心为革命的无产阶级世界观。只有经得起不怕苦的考验，才能在生死考验面前，做到脸不变色心不跳。
