Chairman Mao said: In a socialist society, classes, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. This struggle will inevitably reflect in our minds. Bourgeois ideology constantly flickers in our minds, coming and going. When faced with specific problems, selfish thoughts often emerge from our minds. For example, it is like an X-ray; during the exposure, it only flashes for a moment, but the shadow is imprinted on the film.

To combat selfish thoughts, one must seize the fleeting selfish ideas in the mind and fight them bit by bit.

Fighting bit by bit means fighting concretely, fighting promptly, and fighting resolutely. It does not mean to take it slow.

In our hospital, we once held a case discussion meeting to study the issue of drug resistance in a tuberculosis patient. I thought that transforming one's ideology is like treating a disease; if there is a disease, it must be treated early. If not treated early, a minor illness can become severe, and an acute illness can become chronic. Treatment must be thorough; if one treats for three days and rests for two, not only will the treatment be ineffective, but the body will also develop drug resistance, making the disease more stubborn.

Ideological diseases must also be treated promptly and concretely. For fleeting issues, one must not take them lightly and must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to seize and fight them, eliminating them in their infancy. If one does not seize fleeting issues and fight them bit by bit, without mercy, bourgeois ideological toxins will corrupt one's soul. If allowed to develop, they will become stubborn, causing one's revolutionary will to wane and become paralyzed.

### “一闪一现”和“一点一滴”

    “一闪一现”和“一点一滴”
    解放军某医院　赵俊仙
    毛主席说：社会主义社会，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。这种斗争必然要反映到我们的头脑里来。资产阶级思想，经常在我们头脑里一闪一现，转来转去。一碰到具体问题，私心杂念就往往从头脑里闪出来了。打个比方，好像爱克司光片，在照像时，只不过咔嚓一闪，结果影子就映到底片上去了。
    斗私心，就得抓住头脑里一闪一现的私心杂念，一点一滴地斗。
    一点一滴地斗，就是切切实实地斗，就是及时地斗，就是狠狠地斗。不是慢慢来的意思。
    我们医院里曾经举行过一次病例讨论会，研究一个肺结核病人的“抗药”问题。我想，改造思想也和治病一样，有病必须早治。如不早治，轻病会变成重病，急性病会变成慢性病。治就要治彻底，三天打鱼，两天晒网，治治停停，不但治不好，体内还会产生抗药性，使疾病顽固起来。
    思想上的病，也必须及时治，切实治。对于一闪一现的问题，决不能等闲视之，必须以毛泽东思想为武器，抓住就斗，把它消灭在萌芽状态。如果不抓住一闪一现的问题，一点一滴地斗，无情地斗，资产阶级的思想毒菌就会腐蚀人的灵魂，发展下去，也就会顽固起来，使人的革命意志衰退、瘫痪。
