	The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Political Departments of the Communist Party of China's Industrial and Transportation, Agricultural and Forestry, Financial and Commercial, and Foreign Affairs sectors, as well as the Political Department of the Ministry of Public Security, have recently issued notices. They call on all levels of organizations and the broad masses of workers, commune members, public security personnel, and cadres in various sectors to seriously study the heroic deeds of Cai Yongxiang, a communist warrior who is dedicated to the public good. They urge everyone to resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and turn every organization into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The notices from various units unanimously emphasize that Cai Yongxiang, who has only been in the army for eight months, has rapidly grown into a communist warrior dedicated to the public good. The fundamental reason is his boundless love for Chairman Mao and his unshakable belief in Mao Zedong Thought. He studies and applies Chairman Mao's works with a fervent spirit, focusing on the essence and using the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to revolutionize his soul, eliminate selfishness, and establish public-mindedness. This thoroughly transforms his worldview. To learn from Cai Yongxiang, one must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and use the "Three Articles" as a guiding principle. One must repeatedly study and apply them to transform one's soul and worldview, accelerating the revolutionization of one's thoughts.

	The notices from various units also point out that to learn from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, one must, like Cai Yongxiang, care about state affairs, actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and resolutely oppose the bourgeois reactionary line. One must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. At the same time, one must be highly vigilant, prevent enemy sabotage, and safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The notices from the Political Departments of the Communist Party of China's Industrial and Transportation, Agricultural and Forestry, Financial and Commercial sectors, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also require all workers, commune members, and cadres nationwide to learn from Cai Yongxiang with practical actions. They must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive to seize the revolution and promote production, taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key task, and achieving double victories in revolution and production. The notice from the All-China Women's Federation also requires revolutionary women to not only strive to learn from Cai Yongxiang but also to educate their children and encourage their relatives. They should take Cai Yongxiang as an example, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, transform their worldview, become revolutionary heroes of the Mao Zedong era, strive to be new people of communism, and make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction.
