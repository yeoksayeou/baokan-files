To learn from the revolutionary teachers and students of the capital about the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we came from Hefei to Beijing and stayed in Room 417 of Building 36 at Peking University. The revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University always gave us the convenience and left the difficulties for themselves. As the weather turned cold, they covered themselves with blankets at night and gave us their quilts.

Another classmate and I once experienced something that deeply moved us.

The story is as follows: When we came, we did not bring enough money, and before we left, we spent all our money, so we would encounter difficulties on the way. We were worried, and unexpectedly, this matter was known by a student from Peking University.

One morning, I suddenly found a small paper packet in my pocket. Inside were a few yuan and a note that read: "You have encountered difficulties in your life, why didn't you tell us earlier? Chairman Mao said: 'All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other.' We are all class sisters, all one family. Please, no matter what, do not be polite, keep this money for your journey."

When we read this note, we were truly moved. Later, I found out that this female student was a Red Guard fighter from Peking University, a daughter of a poor peasant. We did not know this student from Peking University, but when we encountered difficulties, she extended a helping hand to us. What precious class feelings! Now, I deeply understand the profound meaning of the song lyric "The depth of class love is greater than the depth of rivers and seas."

    河深海深不如阶级友爱深
    为了向首都的革命师生学习文化大革命的经验，我们从合肥来到了北京，住在北京大学三十六楼四一七室。北大的革命师生处处把方便让给我们，把困难留给自己。天气冷了，晚上他们自己盖毯子，把棉被让给我们。
    我和另一位同学，曾经遇到了一件事，使我们受到很大的感动。
    这件事情的经过是这样的：我们来的时候，钱带的不够，在临走前就把钱花完了，这样路途上就会发生困难。我们正在着急，想不到这件事竟被北大的一位同学知道了。
    一天早晨，我突然在自己的衣服口袋里，发现了一个小纸包，里边有几块钱，还有一张便条，上面写着：“你们在生活上发生了困难，为什么不早点告诉我们呢？毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”我们都是阶级姐妹，都是一家人，请你们无论如何不要客气，把这几块钱留在路上用吧。”
    当我们读着这张小纸条的时候，真是感动极了。后来，我打听到这位女同学是北大的一个红卫兵战士，一个贫农的女儿。我们和这位北大的同学素不相识，当我们遇到困难的时候，她便向我们伸出了援助的手，这是多么可贵的阶级感情呵！如今，我才深切体会到“河深海深不如阶级友爱深”这句歌词的深刻含意。
