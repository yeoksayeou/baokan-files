A revolutionary should dedicate his life to doing good deeds for the revolution. When good deeds are done and praise is received, one should use the praise as a whip to drive oneself forward.

How should one treat praise from leaders? Should one treat praise as a whip to drive oneself forward, or should one treat praise as a burden to carry? After studying Chairman Mao's works, I have developed a correct attitude towards praise.

Once, I had just come out of the hospital and happened to join the troops on a march. The squad leader, seeing that my body was relatively weak, asked me, "Can you walk?" I said, "I can!" He said, "Practicing is good!" I heard the squad leader's words, put on my backpack, and set off with the troops. All the way, I insisted on walking. The squad leader saw my tenacity and praised me all the way, also calling on all the classmates to learn from me. At first, I felt a bit embarrassed, but later I thought that even though I was sick, I could still march dozens of miles, so receiving some praise was only natural! One day, I proactively helped the masses to weed corn and hoe peanuts, and the squad leader praised me in front of everyone. Another time, I helped my comrades wash their clothes and shoes, and the squad leader praised my high communist spirit. The more I was praised, the more active I became, and the more active I became, the more I wanted to hear praise. Gradually, I became complacent. I thought: Doing good deeds, of course, should be praised! The deputy squad leader noticed that my understanding of praise was problematic and, during an individual talk, asked me, "We are all serving the people, doing good deeds for the people and comrades, isn't this what we should do?" This question made me think. I thought: Yes! Why do I do good deeds? Is it for the sake of praise? Wanting praise, what kind of thought is this?

With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's quotations. Chairman Mao said, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." He also said, "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant." Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, I felt that I had put the word "should" in the wrong place. Doing good deeds for the people and comrades, this is what we should do, because we are serving the people, so everyone should do this, and should do this for a lifetime. But we should never treat receiving praise as something we should do. If we think this way, it means we are doing good deeds with selfish motives, and it is not completely and thoroughly serving the people. I also examined my complacent feelings when hearing praise, which is already carrying the burden of pride and arrogance. With such feelings, it will be like what Chairman Mao pointed out: "Seeing only achievements and not seeing shortcomings, loving only flattery and not criticism." This is the beginning of falling behind.

From then on, I decided to break away from selfish thoughts and dedicate myself to doing good deeds for the revolution "for a lifetime." When good deeds are done and leaders praise me, I look for my shortcomings and see where I did not do well, using praise as a starting point for progress. Once, I helped the kitchen crew unload coal from the truck, and the squad leader praised me. I said: Chairman Mao teaches us to "help each other," doing such a small thing is not worth praising. Another time, on night duty, it was raining heavily, and after a day of training, who wouldn't be tired? I thought to let my comrades sleep a little longer, so I stood guard for two more shifts. The comrades said I had a high spirit, and I said: This is what should be done, there's nothing to praise. I deeply felt that how to treat praise is a matter of ideological revolutionization. In the future, I will strive to be neither proud when praised nor discouraged when criticized, using praise and criticism as a whip to drive myself forward.

    怎样对待表扬？
    一个革命者应该为革命做一辈子好事。做了好事，受到表扬，应该把表扬当作鞭策自己前进的动力。
    战士　杨显全
    怎样对待领导上的表扬？是把表扬当作鞭策自己前进的动力，还是把表扬当作包袱背起来？学了毛主席著作，我才对表扬有了正确的态度。
    一次，我刚出医院，赶上部队行军，班长见我身体比较弱，关心地问我：“能不能走？”我说：“能！”他说：“练一练也好！”我听了班长的话，背上背包，跟上部队出发了。一路上，我一直坚持着走。班长见我这样顽强，一路走一路表扬我，还叫全班同志向我学习。开始，我有点不好意思，后来觉得自己有病还能行军几十里，受点表扬还不应该！一天，我主动帮助群众薅包谷、锄花生，班长当众把我夸奖了一番。又一次，我帮同志们洗了衣服和鞋子，班长又夸我共产主义风格高。越表扬，我越积极，越积极，越想听到表扬。慢慢地就沾沾自喜起来。心想：做了好事嘛！当然应该受到表扬。副班长发现我对表扬的认识有问题，个别谈话时，问我：“咱们都是为人民服务的，为人民，为同志做好事，是不是应该的？”这一问，引起我的考虑。心想：是啊！自己为什么做好事呢？难道是为了受表扬？想受表扬是什么思想？
    带着这个问题，我学了毛主席语录。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”又说：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”对照毛主席教导，就觉得自己把“应该”两个字摆错了位置。为人民，为同志做好事，这才是应该的，因为我们是为人民服务的，所以人人都要这样做，一辈子都要这样做。但绝不能把受表扬当作是应该的，如果这样想，就是抱着私心做好事，就不是完全、彻底地为人民服务。我还检查了听到表扬就沾沾自喜的情绪，这不是已经背上了骄傲自大的包袱吗？有了这种情绪，就会像毛主席指出的：“只看见成绩，不看见缺点，只爱听恭维话，不爱听批评话。”这正是落后的开始。
    从此，我下决心破私心杂念，为革命“一辈子做好事”。做了好事，领导表扬时，我就找缺点，看哪些地方做得不好，把表扬当作前进的起点。一次我帮炊事班从车上卸煤，班长表扬我，我说：毛主席教导我们要“互相帮助”，做这点小事，还值得表扬。一次夜里站岗，下着大雨，搞了一天训练，谁不疲乏，我想叫同志们多睡一会，就多站了两班岗，同志们说我风格高，我说：这是应该做的，没啥夸奖头。我深深感到，怎样对待表扬，是个思想革命化问题，以后我决心做到受到表扬不骄傲，受到批评不泄气，把表扬和批评当作鞭策自己前进的动力。
