Editor's Note: Truck driver Zhang Lianhua, from the First Metallurgical Construction Company's Third Mine Tunnel Engineering Company, overcame her fear of difficulties and became a model of safe driving. Her story vividly illustrates that any revolutionary worker, as long as they are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, can become a brave and wise person.

Chairman Mao teaches us that in the struggle for socialism and communism, we must have a fearless spirit. We should be like this truck driver, treating all difficulties as paper tigers, possessing revolutionary spirit and daring in any situation; at the same time, we should have a spirit of seeking truth from facts and strive for excellence in our work. This way, we will be invincible.

We are the great people of the great era of Mao Zedong, bearing the heavy responsibility of revolution. To wholeheartedly serve the people of China and the world, we must have a fearless revolutionary spirit, be selfless, and strive hard to make greater contributions to the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world.

I started working in 1959 as an assistant truck driver. At that time, I was not yet seventeen years old and only knew that becoming a worker meant studying technology well to have a future. Not long after starting to drive, I saw a female driver in our company who, after getting married and having a child, could no longer drive and had to change jobs. This made me waver, doubting that women driving trucks had no future, and I thought about changing to become a mechanic or a fitter.

Driving a Liberation Truck Requires a Liberation Mindset

Just at this time, Chairman Mao issued the great call to learn from Comrade Lei Feng. I seriously read Lei Feng's deeds and was deeply moved. Lei Feng said, "A person's life is limited, but serving the people is limitless. I want to dedicate my limited life to the limitless service of the people." These words gave me great inspiration and encouragement. I began to understand that to become a good worker for Chairman Mao, I must, like Lei Feng, seriously study Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words to transform my thoughts.

I repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" and other articles. Comparing myself with Comrade Bethune and Zhang Zide's spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people, I realized that driving a truck is also revolutionary work and serving the people. My thoughts were resolved, and my confidence grew. Others said women couldn't drive a Liberation truck, but I thought that revolution knows no gender. Liu Hulan was only a teenager and fought alongside men to defeat the enemy. Why couldn't I drive a Liberation truck? Chairman Mao teaches us to dare to struggle and dare to win. Driving a Liberation truck requires a Liberation mindset. Roads are made by people walking on them. Doing revolution requires revolutionary spirit and daring to fight and forge ahead. From then on, I devoted myself to driving trucks, determined to drive trucks for life and do revolution for life.

Cars are dead, people are alive

Our region has high mountains and dangerous roads. Seeing some trucks have accidents, I developed a fear. The more you fear, the more ghosts appear. Once, while reversing, I accidentally hit a piece of wood and bumped into a loader. The fear of having an accident weighed heavily on my mind. Every day when I drove, it was like an old cow pulling a broken cart, extremely slow. Whenever I saw a car or encountered a person, my heart was always filled with fear. This fear in my mind affected my work performance. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." I thought: accidents can also be treated as paper tigers. They seem scary, but if you face them seriously, you can eliminate them. Cars are dead, people are alive. The human factor is the first. As long as you are bold and careful, you can disdain it in your mind and pay attention to it in specific operations. The car will obey my commands.

Once, after driving all day, I was called to drive at night. I thought: driving at night in the mountains is difficult, and my thoughts wavered, fearing that driving alone might cause an accident. But then I thought: I study Chairman Mao's works every day and should listen to Chairman Mao's words. Now that I encounter this difficulty, should I retreat? No, I must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and go where it is most difficult. When the car entered the mountain area, it was dark, and the fog was thick. The headlights couldn't see clearly, and there were no fog lights, so I could only drive with the low beams, feeling my way forward. The higher the mountain, the more turns, the thicker the fog, and I couldn't see where the road was or the rocks. When I reached a long downhill slope of over ten kilometers, even the low beams couldn't see the road. I opened the car door, leaned out, looking at the mountain edge, shining the car path, one hand on the steering wheel, one foot on the brake, driving a few steps and then stopping to look. This way, what should have been a one-hour journey took over two hours. When I returned, it was already midnight. My comrades hadn't slept, worried that I had an accident and were ready to find me. I said: "Driving at night in this area is somewhat difficult, but the car is controlled by people. As long as you are bold and careful, you can overcome any difficulty."

Chairman Mao's teachings on strategically disdaining the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously made me understand a truth: "People rely on thought, cars rely on maintenance." Once, the leadership gave me an urgent transportation task. This section of the road is over six hundred kilometers round trip, requiring me to go during the day and return at night. The trip there was smooth, but the return trip encountered unexpected problems. I was driving in a deep mountain with no villages or shops nearby when the car suddenly broke down. I didn't know what was wrong. I was alone, scared, and anxious. What should I do? My heart panicked, and I cried. Just then, a truck came from the opposite direction. The driver helped me fix the car. This incident made me realize that to prevent car accidents, you must first prevent accidents in your mind and continuously improve your technical skills. Therefore, I followed Dr. Bethune's spirit of pursuing excellence in technology, carefully studying repair techniques, and often using my rest time to disassemble and check the easily damaged parts of the car, then reassemble them. I also frequently went to the repair team to help fix cars, doing some odd jobs, and asking teachers for help when I didn't understand. This way, I initially mastered the repair techniques for handling faults, and in subsequent transportation work, I never had any on-route faults. By the end of 1965, I achieved a record of safe driving for 160,000 kilometers and was continuously rated as a safety model for several years.

Driving a Vehicle of Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda

Chairman Mao said, "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." I firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and regard caring for and helping comrades as my duty. Once, a truck broke down and stopped by the roadside. The driver saw me driving by and waved me to stop from a distance. However, when I drove up to him and jumped off the car to help him fix the car, he turned away and continued his own work, saying, "You go away!" I understood that he looked down on me. At that time, I was still an apprentice, and my skills were not solid. But when I looked up and saw that his car had a "trainee car" sign, I thought, regardless of his opinion of me, I had driven a few more days than him, and helping him fix the car was my responsibility! So, I actively helped him check the car's problem, which turned out to be a faulty ignition coil. At that time, he still didn't believe the problem was there. I explained to him the cause and effect of this problem and finally installed a spare ignition coil from my car. When he tested the car, it worked. Then, he apologetically said to me, "Thank you, teacher." We traveled together for a long distance. When we reached the destination, he repeatedly thanked me and asked, "Why did you help me even though I treated you so badly?" I told him: We drive revolutionary vehicles and walk on the revolutionary road. We must help each other to make the revolutionary vehicle advance victoriously on the revolutionary road.

Because I realized: We are all working to build our country, to support the world's revolutionary people, to compete with imperialism for time, to complete the tasks given by the Party quickly, efficiently, and economically, and we are on the same revolutionary road. We are not just driving trucks; we are driving political vehicles, driving vehicles of revolutionary style, and driving vehicles of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda.

The more difficult the struggle, the more it can temper a person

Chairman Mao's works made me further understand whom to love and whom to hate. The more I study Chairman Mao's works, the more I love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love socialism, the more I love my work. Whether it's day or night, I work as if I'm on the battlefield. Once, the dispatcher notified me the night before that I needed to go pull cement the next day. That night, my stomach hurt, and I had a high fever, not sleeping all night. The next day, I felt weak all over. At that time, I thought: the construction needs cement, and if the car doesn't go out for a day, it will affect the construction. Lei Feng could work while sick, Qiu Shaoyun could endure being burned by fire for the revolution's victory, could I not go out for this little sickness? So, I got out of bed, didn't eat, and started the car to the station. When my car returned to the site fully loaded with cement, the loaders hadn't started work yet. At that time, it was about to rain. I thought of Xiang Xiu Li, who sacrificed her life to save state property, and decided to unload the cement into the warehouse before the rain to prevent state property from being damaged. I and a few night-shift workers unloaded the car together. I sweated, and the rain soaked my clothes, feeling cold and hungry, but my heart was warm. I thought, I was acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

Through practical struggles, I deeply understood a truth: the more difficult the struggle, the more it can temper a person; the more urgent the task, the more difficulties, the more you need to study Chairman Mao's works. Studying Chairman Mao's works is a process of eliminating bourgeois thoughts and promoting proletarian thoughts, a process of continuously transforming one's thoughts. I am determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, always listen to the Party's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and become a red and expert revolutionary successor.

    在革命大道上开革命车
    第一冶金建设公司第三井巷工程公司汽车司机　张莲花
    编者按：汽车司机张莲花，由害怕困难，到“敢”字当头，闯过重重难关，最后成为安全行车标兵。她的事迹生动地说明了：任何一个革命工作者，只要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，努力用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，就会成为一个勇敢的人，成为一个聪明的人。
      毛主席教导我们，在为社会主义和共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有一种大无畏的精神。我们应该像这位汽车司机一样，把一切困难都如实地看成是纸老虎，在任何情况下都具有革命的气魄和革命的胆略；同时又有实事求是的精神，在自己的工作中精益求精。这样，我们就会无往而不胜。
      我们是伟大的毛泽东时代的伟大的人民，肩负着革命的重担。我们要全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务，就必须具有大无畏的革命精神，克己奉公，努力奋斗，以便为中国人民和全世界革命人民作出更大的贡献。
    我一九五九年参加工作，当汽车司机助手。那时，我还不满十七岁，只知道当上了工人就要好好学习技术，将来才有前途。开车不久，看到我们公司一位女司机结婚后有了孩子，不能开车，改了行。思想就起了波动，怀疑女同志开汽车没有前途，想改行学车工和钳工。
    开解放牌汽车，要有“解放牌”思想
    正在这时，毛主席发出了向雷锋同志学习的伟大号召。我认真地读了雷锋的事迹，很感动。雷锋说：“人的生命是有限的，可是，为人民服务是无限的，我要把有限的生命，投入到无限的‘为人民服务’之中去。”这句话给了我很大的启发和鞭策。我开始懂得要做毛主席的好工人，就必须像雷锋那样认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，改造自己的思想。
    我反复学习了《纪念白求恩》和《为人民服务》等文章。对照白求恩同志和张思德同志完全彻底为人民服务的精神，我认识到开汽车也是革命工作，也是为人民服务。思想问题解决了，信心也大了。人家说女同志开解放牌大汽车不行，我想干革命不分男女，刘胡兰才十几岁，就和男同志一样参加战斗，打击敌人，我为什么就不能开解放牌汽车呢？毛主席教导我们，要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。开解放牌汽车，就要有“解放牌”的思想。路是人走出来的，干革命就要有革命气魄，敢拚敢闯。从此，我就安心开汽车的工作，决心开一辈子汽车，干一辈子革命。
          车是死的，人是活的
    我们这个地区，山高、路险，看到有的车出了事故，心里就产生了“怕”的问题。真是越怕越出鬼。有一次，倒车不小心压上一根木头，碰着了一位装卸工人，思想上“怕”出事故这个包袱，更放不下来了。每天开起车来，像老牛拉破车一样，慢得要命。一见到车，一遇到人，心里总是怕。思想上叫这个“怕”字给缠住了，结果影响了运输任务。这时候，我又带着这个问题学习了毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论述。我想：事故也可以当成是纸老虎，看起来很可怕，但只要认真对待，就可以消灭它。车子是死的，人是活的，人的因素第一，只要胆大心细，在思想上藐视它，在具体操作上重视它，车子就会听我使唤。
    有一次，白天开了一天车，晚上回来，车刚停，领导上又叫我连夜出车。我想：山区夜间雾大，出车有困难，思想上有点动摇，怕一个人出车发生事故。又一想：我整天学习毛主席著作，要听毛主席的话，现在遇到了这点困难，我就退却了吗？不，我一定要按照毛主席的教导，越是困难的地方越是要去。当车开进山区的时候，天黑了，雾大，开大灯看不清，又没有防雾灯，只能开着近光灯摸着往前走。越走山越高，弯越多，雾越大，已经看不清哪是路，哪是岩了。走到一个长十多公里的下坡道，开近光灯也看不到路了。我就打开车门，探着身子，看着山边，照着车路，一手扶着方向盘，一只脚踏着刹车，走几步就停停看看。就这样，本来走一个小时的路程，结果走了两个多小时，回来时已经是半夜了。同志们都没有睡，担心我出了事故，准备去找我。我说：“在这个地区晚上出车是有些困难的，但是，车是靠人来掌握的，只要胆大心细，再大的困难也能战胜。”
    毛主席关于战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人的教导，使我懂得了一个真理：“人靠思想，车靠保养。”有一次，领导上交给我一个紧急的运输任务。这一段路程来往六百多公里，要求白天去，晚上赶回来。去时很顺利，可是回来却出现了意外。正走在一个前不挨村、后不着店的深山里，车子突然坏了，不知哪里出了毛病？我一个人，又害怕、又着急。怎么办？心里一慌，哭了起来。这时迎面开来一辆汽车，车上的老师傅，热情帮助我把车修理好了。这件事使我感到，要想车子不出事故，首先要思想上不出事故，同时也要在技术上不断提高。于是，我按照白求恩大夫对技术精益求精的精神，用心学习修理技术，经常利用休息时间，把车上容易坏的部件拆下来，仔细检查，再照样装上去。同时我还常到修理组帮助修汽车，干些零活，遇到不懂的就向老师傅请教。这样，我初步掌握了处理故障的修理技术，在以后的运输工作中，从没出过任何途中故障。一九六五年底达到了安全行车十六万公里的纪录，连续几年被评为安全标兵。
        开车要开毛泽东思想宣传车
    毛主席说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”我牢牢记着毛主席的教导，把关心同志、帮助同志看作是我的职责。有一次，一部卡车抛锚了，停在路边，司机见我开着车过来，很远就高兴地招手叫我停下来。可是，当我把车开到他跟前，跳下车准备帮助他修车时，他一看我是个女的，就转过身去继续搞他自己的去了，并说“你走吧！”我明白他有些瞧不起我。我那时还是个学徒，技术本来不过硬；可是一抬头看到他的车上挂了个“实习车”的牌子，我就想，不管他对我有啥看法，我还是比他多开了几天车，帮助他修一修也是我的责任呀！于是我就主动地帮助他检查了车子的毛病，原来是容电器坏了。当时他还不相信毛病就出在这里，我给他讲了出这种毛病的根源和影响，最后我把自己车上备用的一个容电器给他装上了，一试车，果然行了。这时，他歉疚地对我说：“师傅，谢谢你了。”我们同行了很长一段路。到了目的地，他再三感谢我，并问：“我对你的态度那么不好，你为什么还要来帮助我呢？”我对他讲：我们开的是革命车，走的是革命道，我们要互相帮助，使革命的车在革命大道上胜利前进。
    因为我认识到：我们都是为建设自己的祖国，为支援世界人民革命，为了同帝国主义争时间，为了多快好省地完成党交给我们的任务，而走在同一条革命的大道上。我们不光是开汽车，而是要开政治车，开革命风格车，开毛泽东思想宣传车。
      斗争越艰苦，越能锻炼人
    毛主席著作使我进一步懂得了应该热爱谁、痛恨谁。我越学毛主席著作，越热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义，就越热爱自己的工作。不管是白天，晚上，我干起活来好像是在战场上。有一次，调度员头天晚上通知我，第二天要我去拉水泥。夜里我的胃病犯了，又发高烧，一夜没睡好觉，第二天全身无力。当时我想：施工需要水泥，少出一天车，就会影响施工。雷锋能带病参加劳动，邱少云为了革命的胜利能忍受烈火烧身，我只这点小病就不能出车吗？于是我就翻身下床，饭也没吃，开起车就往车站跑。当我的车满载水泥回到现场时，装卸工还没上班。这时天要下雨。我想到向秀丽为挽救国家财产献出生命，就决心在下雨以前把水泥卸到仓库里，不使国家财产受到损失。我和几个晚班的工人，一起把车卸完。我出了一身汗，雨又淋湿了衣服，感到又冷又饿，可是心里却热呼呼的。我想，我是在按照毛主席的教导办事的。
    通过实践斗争，使我深刻认识到一个道理：斗争越艰苦，越能锻炼人；任务越急，困难越多，越要学习毛主席著作。学习毛主席著作是灭资兴无的过程，是不断自我思想改造的过程。我下定决心要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，永远听党的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，作一个又红又专的革命接班人。
