The first Asian People's Solidarity Games are set to open tomorrow in Phnom Penh. The host country, Cambodia, has completed all preparations for the Games in an outstanding manner. Athletes and sports officials from various countries participating in the Games have enthusiastically praised the Cambodian government and people for their excellent preparations under the personal care and support of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. They pointed out that this is another new contribution by the Cambodian people to strengthening Asian people's unity and the anti-imperialist struggle.

To host this grand international sports event, a large-scale, well-equipped "Sports City" has been built. During the construction of the new "Sports City" and the renovation of existing sports facilities, the Cambodian working people have been toiling day and night. Whether under the scorching sun or sudden rainstorms, they have been fighting and working joyfully.

To ensure a stable supply of water and electricity during the Games, the Cambodian Electricity Company and water supply departments have made full preparations. In addition to the existing power supply facilities at each competition venue, more than 200 workers from the Electricity Company have laid backup underground power lines. The electricians have also inspected and repaired the streetlights on two major streets in Phnom Penh—Mao Zedong Avenue and Sihanouk Boulevard—to ensure that these avenues will be brightly lit throughout the Games.

Cambodian drivers are busy day and night for the Games.

To welcome this Games, the Cambodian sports authorities have organized various training classes, training more than 330 referees, including over 110 female referees. They have all expressed their determination to do a good job in refereeing and contribute their efforts to the Games.

In recent days, tens of thousands of young people, students, and soldiers have been rehearsing a large-scale group gymnastics performance for the opening ceremony of the Asian People's Solidarity Games at the comprehensive sports field.

    柬埔寨人民对加强亚洲人民团结反帝事业作出新贡献
    第一届亚洲新运会准备工作出色完成
    据新华社金边二十四日电　本社记者报道：第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会明天就要在这里开幕了。东道国柬埔寨为这届运动会进行的各项准备工作，已经出色地完成。前来参加运动会的各国体育工作者和运动员们，热烈赞扬柬埔寨政府和人民，在西哈努克亲王的亲切关怀和支持下所完成的杰出的准备工作。他们指出，这是柬埔寨人民对加强亚洲人民团结反帝事业所作出的又一个新的贡献。
    为了举办这次盛大的国际体育比赛，一个规模巨大、设备完善的“体育城”已经建成。在新建“体育城”和改建原有运动场地的过程中，柬埔寨劳动人民日日夜夜辛勤劳动。有时烈日当空，有时暴雨突袭，他们都愉快地战斗着、工作着。
    为了保证运动会期间水电的正常供应，柬埔寨电力公司和供水机构早已作了充分的准备。除了各个比赛场地原有的供电设备以外，电力公司的二百多名职工还铺设了备用的地下供电线。电力工人们对金边的两条大街——毛泽东大道和西哈努克大道的路灯，都进行了检查和修理，准备让这些大道在运动会期间通宵达旦大放光明。
    柬埔寨的汽车司机正在为运动会昼夜奔忙。
    为了迎接这届运动会，柬埔寨体育机构曾经开办了各种训练班，培训了三百三十多名裁判员，其中包括女裁判员一百一十多人。他们一致表示要作好裁判工作，为运动会贡献出自己的力量。
    这些天来，数以万计的青年、学生和士兵正在综合运动场为亚洲新运会的开幕式排练大型团体操。
