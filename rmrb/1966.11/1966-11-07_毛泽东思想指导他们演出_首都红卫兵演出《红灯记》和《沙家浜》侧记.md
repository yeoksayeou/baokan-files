In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a group of young revolutionaries from the capital's art schools, led by the Red Guards, displayed their bold, daring, and revolutionary spirit. In a very short period, they independently directed and performed the famous revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang." These two plays received praise from central leaders and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. After the performance, many audience members rushed onto the stage, shaking hands with the young revolutionaries and saying, "You performed wonderfully! You performed the feelings of the proletariat, and the spirit of the Red Guards!"

Their performance victory was the result of daring to think, dare to act, and dare to challenge the bourgeois "authorities"; it was the result of being full of revolutionary aspirations and bravely overcoming all difficulties; and it was also the result of striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works!

Acting According to Chairman Mao's Instructions

The young Red Guards who participated in the performances of these two revolutionary modern plays were the youngest at fifteen and the oldest at twenty. On the occasion of the 17th anniversary of our national founding, they all had a common wish: to perform revolutionary modern plays and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The plays they chose were the famous revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang."

Despite their youth, lack of experience, tight schedule, and heavy tasks, and the fact that they did not know each other, these daring and bold young revolutionaries did not bow down to difficulties. They regarded Mao Zedong Thought as their source of strength and as a spiritual atomic bomb to overcome all difficulties.

"We all come from the four corners of the country, united by a common revolutionary goal." "In times of difficulty, we must see achievements, see light, and raise our courage." After they organized and formed the performance team, the first thing they learned was these two quotations. "Yes, although we come from different schools, our revolutionary goal is the same!" "No mountain is higher than the Red Guards' aspirations, no sea is deeper than the Red Guards' determination. With Mao Zedong Thought guiding us forward, what difficulties can we not overcome! We don't care about those bourgeois stinking directors, stinking celebrities, and stinking experts. We only uphold one family, the family of proletarian revolutionaries!"

The rehearsals began. What if there was no director? Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes," and "The people have limitless creativity." Directors come from the masses, and the masses are the directors. For every scene they rehearsed, those on stage performed, while those not on stage watched intently and took notes on their opinions. After rehearsing, they discussed which opinion aligned with Mao Zedong Thought and followed that opinion to make changes.

Previously, they were excluded by the bourgeois masters and had never played leading roles; now, they had to replace the positions of those "elites" in the eyes of the bourgeoisie and perform the leading roles themselves, which indeed presented many difficulties in acting skills.

"In any class society, any class always places political standards first and artistic standards second." Chairman Mao's quotation again opened the minds of the young revolutionaries like a golden key. They said, "We perform to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and must place political standards first! As for art, what the bourgeois 'authorities' can do, we can do, and we must do it better!"

The performer of Li Yuhe in "The Red Lantern" answered this question with a loud voice and actual actions. He said, "We perform for the revolution, performing our revolutionary predecessors. I must sing the strongest note of the proletariat! I must surpass those bourgeois 'authorities' in emotion and temperament!" This young revolutionary poured all his emotions into the image of Li Yuhe and received the audience's praise.

"Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Whenever difficulties blocked their path, they recited Chairman Mao's quotation, and boundless strength surged within them! During the rehearsal of a difficult martial arts scene in "Shajiabang," one young revolutionary fell with a thud, and another broke his chin. But these two comrades immediately stood up, looking at the quotation from Chairman Mao on the stage, and loudly recited, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Instantly, all the performers had tears in their eyes, reciting in unison. They seemed to see Chairman Mao by their side encouraging them.... Reciting, reciting, they resumed their rehearsal!

The young revolutionaries performing "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang" said, "In the past, those bourgeois 'authorities' always said that studying Chairman Mao's quotations was useless, which is sheer nonsense. Why could we rehearse these two plays well? It was not because of anything else but because we strove to study the shining quotations of Chairman Mao!"

Everything Must Highlight Mao Zedong Thought

The young revolutionaries regarded "everything must highlight Mao Zedong Thought" as the highest standard for evaluating every action, every line, every slide, and every note.

To rehearse a scene in "The Red Lantern," they struggled through several all-nighters and rehearsed dozens of times, changing seven plans. They said, "If there is any part that does not highlight Mao Zedong Thought, even if we rehearse a thousand times or ten thousand times, we must overturn it and modify it until it is corrected!"

Lighting and stage design must also highlight Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards responsible for the lighting and stage design in "Shajiabang" had always been excluded by the bourgeois "authorities" and were not allowed to draw slides. This time, when they picked up their colored pencils to draw Chairman Mao's portrait, they felt extremely excited. They said, "This pen is given by Chairman Mao! This paint is given by Chairman Mao! I have the opportunity to draw a portrait of the most beloved leader, which is also given by Chairman Mao!" They condensed this strong class sentiment into the tip of their pen, taking high responsibility for every stroke and every angle, meticulously. They drew for two nights, and when they were really tired, they splashed some cold water on their heads to refresh their spirits and continued drawing! When they turned on the lights at night and projected the majestic and benevolent image of Chairman Mao on the screen, everyone immediately embraced each other, jumped for joy, and shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The musical accompaniment must also highlight Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "We are the orchestra that praises Mao Zedong Thought. Every bow, every gong, and every note must play the emotions of the proletariat and embody Mao Zedong Thought!"

In the Face of Achievements

The performance had ended a long time ago, but the lights were still brightly shining. Tonight's performance was warmly welcomed by the audience, so why were the performers of "The Red Lantern" still sitting on the stage, each with such a serious and earnest expression? It turned out that they were summarizing tonight's performance and conducting criticism and self-criticism.

"The performer of the cigarette seller missed the cue, which was an accident during the performance!"

"The instruments played tonight were not as unified and emotional as before!"

After some young revolutionaries pointed out the shortcomings of tonight's performance, each person held a quotation book, addressed the issues, found answers, and raised their hands to speak:

"We must not downplay major issues or minor issues; we should treat minor issues as major ones. Chairman Mao said that everything must be accountable to the people. Why are we not accountable to the people? Why did the performer of the cigarette seller forget to appear? Is it because we are satisfied with victory and look down on minor issues? I suggest that everyone study Chairman Mao's quotations again: Humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind."

"I say we must first grasp politics and the soul to grasp the performance. Tonight's accompaniment was not as good as before. Is it because we have grown arrogant? Is it because we have been praised for our performance and looked down on our own bow and gong? If we have achieved something, it is only because of the Party and Chairman Mao. What is there for us to be proud of? Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress.' What reason do we have to stop, slack off, and be proud after achieving a little success? We must know that we are still far from being good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought! Our climb to the peak of proletarian revolutionary art is only the first step of a long march! We should be vigilant against arrogance and keep moving forward!"

Mao Zedong Thought indeed guided the young revolutionaries in their performances. Before rehearsals, they studied quotations; during performances, they studied quotations; when they failed, they studied quotations; when they succeeded, they studied quotations; when they were discouraged, they studied quotations; when they were complacent, they studied quotations; when they faced difficulties, they studied quotations; and even when they faced achievements, they studied quotations. They always strove to act according to Chairman Mao's thoughts.

Revolutionaries perform revolutionary plays, and the young revolutionaries themselves are deeply educated! They said, "We are not only performing, but also receiving class education and education in Mao Zedong Thought! When we perform the revolutionary heroes in the play, we think of the revolutionary predecessors who sacrificed their lives, spilled their blood, and bravely advanced; we think of their greatness, integrity, and the unyielding spirit of the proletariat; when we perform 'Shajiabang,' we further understand the greatness of Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war! Revolution has successors, and the red torch is passed on. We must forever advance under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and dedicate our lives to the great cause of communism!"

### 毛泽东思想指导他们演出——首都红卫兵演出《红灯记》和《沙家浜》侧记

    毛泽东思想指导他们演出
    ——首都红卫兵演出《红灯记》和《沙家浜》侧记
    红涛
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，以首都一部分艺术院校的红卫兵为主的小将们发扬敢想、敢干、敢革命的精神，在很短的时间内，自导自演，成功地演出了著名革命现代京剧《红灯记》和《沙家浜》。这两个戏，获得了中央领导同志的赞扬和广大工农兵群众的热烈欢迎。演出结束后，不少观众涌向舞台，紧紧握住小将们的手说：“你们演得好呵！演出了无产阶级的感情，演出了红卫兵的志气！”
    他们演出的胜利，是敢想敢干、敢于向资产阶级“权威”挑战的结果；是充满革命壮志，勇于战胜一切困难的结果；更是努力活学活用毛主席著作的结果！
    按照毛主席说的去做
    参加这两个革命现代戏演出的红卫兵小将们，最大的才二十岁，最小的只有十五岁。在我国国庆十七周年的时候，他们都有一个共同的愿望，就是要演好革命现代戏，宣传毛泽东思想。他们选定的节目就是著名的革命现代京剧《红灯记》和《沙家浜》。
    年轻，没经验，时间紧，任务重，大家又互不相识……不少困难摆在他们面前，但这些敢想、敢干的革命小将们，没有向困难低头。他们把毛泽东思想当作自己力量的源泉，当作战胜一切困难的精神原子弹。
    “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”当他们串连成立演出队后，首先学的就是这两条语录。“是呀，咱们虽然来自不同学校，但革命目标就是一个呵！”“高山高不过红卫兵的壮志，大海大不过红卫兵的决心，有毛泽东思想指引着我们前进，还有什么困难闯不过！咱们不稀罕那些资产阶级的臭导演，臭名流，臭专家，咱们树立的只有一家，就是无产阶级的革命家！”
    排演开始了，没有导演怎么办？毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力”。导演来自群众，群众就是导演。他们每排一场戏，出场的人在台上演，不出场的演员在台下聚精会神地看，随时把意见记下来。排完以后，大家再来讨论，那条意见符合毛泽东思想，就照那条意见改。
    以前，他们受资产阶级老爷的排斥，从未担任过主角；现在，要取代那些资产阶级眼中的“尖子”的地位，自己来扮演主角，这在表演技巧上确实存在不少困难。
    “……任何阶级社会中的任何阶级，总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的。”毛主席这条语录又像金钥匙一样，打开了小将们的心窍。他们说：“咱们演出就是要宣传毛泽东思想，一定要把政治标准摆在第一位！至于在艺术上，资产阶级‘权威’能做到的，咱们也做得到，而且要做得更好！”
    《红灯记》中李玉和的扮演者，以响亮的声音和实际的行动，回答了这个问题。他说：“我们是为革命演戏，演的就是我们的革命前辈，我要唱出无产阶级的最强音！我要在感情上、气质上压倒那些资产阶级‘权威’！”这位革命小将，把自己的全部感情倾注在李玉和的形象中，得到了观众的赞扬。
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”每当困难拦路的时候，他们念起毛主席这段语录，身上就涌出了无穷的力量！《沙家浜》的演员在排练一个难度较大的武打动作时，啪的一声，一位小将摔倒了，另一个也砸破了下巴。但这两位同志马上爬起来，望着舞台上贴着的毛主席语录，高声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”顿时，全体演员都热泪盈眶，合着一个节拍朗诵。他们仿佛看到毛主席就在身旁鼓舞着他们，……念着，念着，他们又照常排练起来了！
    演《红灯记》《沙家浜》的革命小将们说：“过去，那些资产阶级‘权威’总说学毛主席语录没有用，这完全是胡说。我们为什么能排好这两出戏，不是靠了别的，就是靠了努力学习金光闪闪的毛主席语录呵！”
    一切都要突出毛泽东思想
    革命小将们把“一切都要突出毛泽东思想”，当作衡量自己每个动作，每句台词，每张幻灯片，每个音符的最高标准。
    为了排好《红灯记》中的一个场面，他们奋战了几个通宵，排练了几十次，改换了七个方案。他们说：“如果有哪个地方不突出毛泽东思想，就是排一千次，一万次，也得要推翻，要修改，直到改好为止！”
    灯光布景，也要突出毛泽东思想。负责《沙家浜》灯光布景的红卫兵，过去一直受资产阶级“权威”排斥，不让他们画幻灯片。这次，当他们拿起彩笔来为毛主席画像时，心里感到无比激动。他们说：“这笔是毛主席给的！这油彩是毛主席给的！我能有为最最敬爱的领袖画像的机会，也是毛主席给的！”他们把这种强烈的阶级感情凝结在笔尖上，对于每一笔、每一角度，都是高度负责，一丝不苟。他们一连画了两宿，实在困了，就用冷水冲冲头，振作一下精神又画下去！当他们深夜亮起灯光，在银幕上映出魁梧、慈祥的毛主席像时，大家立即互相拥抱着，欢跳着，齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    音乐伴奏也要突出毛泽东思想。他们说：“我们是歌颂毛泽东思想的乐队，每一弓，每一锣，每一个音符，都要奏出无产阶级的感情，都要体现出毛泽东思想！”
    在成绩面前
    散戏已经很久了，灯光还明晃晃地亮着。今晚的演出受到了观众热烈的欢迎，为什么《红灯记》的演员还坐在舞台上，一个个神态这么严肃认真呢？原来，他们在总结今晚的演出，在开展批评和自我批评。
    “扮演卖烟卷的人误场了，这是演出中的事故！”
    “今晚的乐器奏得没有以前那样整齐，那样有感情！”
    当一些小将把当晚演出中的缺点提出后，接着，每个人手持语录本，针对问题，寻找答案，纷纷举手发言：
    “咱们决不能大事化小，小事化了，应该把小事当作大事看待。毛主席说，一切都要向人民负责，咱们为什么不向人民负责？扮演卖烟卷的同志为什么忘记出场了？是不是咱们在胜利面前满足了，瞧不起小事了？我建议大家再来好好学习毛主席语录：虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”
    “我说要抓演出，先要抓政治，抓灵魂。今晚伴奏不如以往，是不是在咱们身上滋长了骄傲情绪？是不是因为我们的演出受到了称赞就小看了自己这一弓，小看自己这一锣了？如果咱们有点成绩的话，也只能归功于党，归功于毛主席，有什么值得咱们骄傲呢？毛主席教导咱们，‘人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。’我们有啥理由得了一点点成绩就停滞，就松懈，就骄傲呢！要知道，咱们离当好毛泽东思想宣传员还很远呢！咱们要攀登无产阶级革命艺术的高峰还只是万里长征的第一步！咱们应该戒骄戒躁，不断前进呵！”
    毛泽东思想确确实实在指导革命小将们演出。排演前学语录，演出中学语录；失败时学语录，成功时学语录；气馁时学语录，自满时学语录；困难时学语录，在成绩面前也学语录。他们时时处处都在努力按毛主席思想办事。
    革命人演革命戏，革命小将们自己也在深深受教育！他们说：“我们不单是在演戏，也是在受阶级教育，受毛泽东思想的教育！当我们演起剧中革命英雄人物的时候，就想起了革命前辈抛头颅，洒热血，前赴后继，奋勇向前的英雄气概，就想起了他们伟大的情怀，坚贞的气节，从容就义的无产阶级硬骨头精神；当我们演起《沙家浜》时，就进一步理解到毛主席关于人民战争思想的无比伟大！革命自有后来人，红色后代接红灯，咱们要永远在毛泽东思想的指挥下奋勇前进，为伟大的共产主义事业献出一生！”
