	New China News Agency, Santiago: The organ of the Chilean Revolutionary Communist Party, "Spartacus," recently published an article titled "Mao Zedong Thought is Contemporary Marxism-Leninism." The article states that "Mao Zedong Thought is the most correct guiding principle for building a socialist society and transitioning to communism."

	The article says: "Mao Zedong Thought was born out of long-term revolutionary practice," and "Mao Zedong Thought is filled with the most precious and innovative teachings."

	The article says: "The Chinese people and the people of other countries naturally admire Mao Zedong Thought because it most profoundly expresses the interests of the broad masses of the people, most brilliantly concentrates their aspirations, and at the same time points out the most correct revolutionary path for these aspirations to be realized. The people who are fighting for their own liberation or for the path to communism, as they deepen their understanding, regard Mao Zedong Thought as their own thought, and thus love Mao Zedong Thought and take it as their guide to action."

	The article enthusiastically praises the mass movement of the Chinese people studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The article points out that the Chinese people mastering Mao Zedong Thought will make "the revolutionary creative power that China will display in all fields immeasurable." The article strongly condemns the attacks by modern revisionists on Mao Zedong Thought and the slander against the Chinese people's love and study of Chairman Mao's works. The article points out that "the merits of Mao Zedong's works have been proven by historical facts," and the attacks by revisionists on Mao Zedong Thought are a betrayal of Marxism-Leninism.

    智利革命共产党机关报《斯巴达克报》发表文章说
    毛泽东思想充满了最有创见的教导
    中国人民活学活用毛主席著作将发挥出无法估量的创造力
    新华社讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利革命共产党机关报《斯巴达克报》最近发表题为《毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义》的文章说，毛泽东思想“是建设社会主义社会和向共产主义过渡的最正确的指导方针”。
    文章说：“毛泽东思想是在长期的革命实践中产生的”，“毛泽东思想充满了最宝贵、最有创见的教导”。
    文章说：“中国人民和世界其他国家的人民理所当然地敬仰毛泽东思想，是因为毛泽东思想最深刻地表达了广大人民群众的利益，最天才地集中了他们的渴望，同时也为使这些渴望得到满足指明了最正确的革命道路。那些为自身的解放或为走向共产主义而斗争的人民群众，随着体会的加深，把毛泽东思想看作是自己的思想，因此热爱毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想当作自己行动的指南。”
    文章热烈赞扬中国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。文章指出，中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，将使“中国在各个领域中所发挥的革命创造力量无法估计”。文章强烈谴责现代修正主义者对毛泽东思想的攻击和对中国人民热爱和学习毛主席著作的污蔑。文章指出，“毛泽东著作的功绩已被历史事实所证实”，修正主义者对毛泽东思想的攻击是他们对马克思列宁主义的背叛。
