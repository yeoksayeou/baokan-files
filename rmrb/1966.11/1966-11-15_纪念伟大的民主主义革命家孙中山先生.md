Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the first and greatest democratic revolutionary in Chinese history, an outstanding revolutionary leader and national hero. His lifelong work has immense significance for the Chinese people in their struggle to rid themselves of imperialist and feudal oppression, to achieve national independence and democracy and freedom. Today, as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth, we express our deep admiration and heartfelt respect for him.

Dr. Sun was born in 1866, at a time when China was in deep crisis following the Opium War and the failure of the Taiping Rebellion. The country was beset by internal and external pressures, and the people suffered greatly. The invasion of foreign imperialists began to disintegrate China's feudal natural economy, and Chinese national capitalism began its initial development. However, the purpose of the imperialist countries in invading China was not to transform feudal China into a capitalist China, but to turn feudal China into a colony or semi-colony, enslaving the Chinese people forever. The Opium War further exposed the corrupt and incompetent nature of the Qing government and deepened the contradictions between the Chinese people and the foreign invaders and the ruling class of the Qing dynasty. From then on, the Chinese people continuously fought against internal and external enemies. Before Dr. Sun's birth, the Qing government, in order to make up for the losses of the Opium War and to pay huge indemnities, increased taxes on the peasants, leading to widespread anti-Qing uprisings. In 1851, a great revolutionary movement, the Taiping Rebellion, broke out in southern China. This revolution occupies a glorious page in the history of the Chinese people's struggle for liberation. However, because this revolution was purely a peasant revolution without the leadership of advanced social forces, it ultimately failed. Afterward, some intellectuals and the emerging bourgeoisie, in order to resist foreign invaders and seek China's independence and prosperity, proposed reformist ideas reflecting the demand for the realization of Western capitalist political and economic systems. These ideas played a certain role in the awakening and progress of the Chinese people. But the reformers did not see the power of the masses, only dreaming of self-reform from the top down by the Qing court, not daring to raise the banner of revolution, lacking a mass base, and thus also failed. Only the revolution led by Dr. Sun advanced the cause begun by the Taiping Rebellion and the reform movement.

Dr. Sun was born into a poor peasant family. The miserable life of the old Chinese countryside determined the direction of his lifelong struggle. At the age of twelve, while studying in Hawaii, he saw the struggle between the local people and the colonists, which sparked his anti-imperialist thoughts. The resistance of the Chinese people during the Sino-French War and the surrender activities of the Qing court further aroused his patriotic sentiments. However, he still had some illusions about the Qing government at that time. In 1894, he submitted a memorial to Li Hongzhang, proposing the idea of self-strengthening through reform. He advocated that "people should fully utilize their talents, land should fully utilize its resources, goods should fully utilize their uses, and commodities should flow freely." Li Hongzhang did not adopt his suggestions. That same year, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and he once again felt the serious crisis facing the country, firmly believing that only a thorough revolution was the only way out for China. From then on, he began to dedicate himself as a staunch revolutionary democrat to the great revolutionary cause of overthrowing autocracy and establishing a republic.

In the autumn of 1894, at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, Dr. Sun went to Hawaii alone to propagate revolution, to unite the overseas Chinese, and to establish the first revolutionary organization, the Revive China Society. The following year, he returned to Hong Kong and set up the headquarters of the Revive China Society.

After the establishment of the Revive China Society, Dr. Sun began to engage in irreconcilable struggles with the reformists. In 1904, in Hawaii, he published "A Letter to My Fellow Countrymen," severely criticizing the propaganda of the constitutional monarchy faction led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. He had a close personal friendship with Liang Qichao, but he strictly drew the line in ideological struggles. Dr. Sun said: "With Rongqing, although our personal friendship is close, once we talk about politics, we are like enemies from different countries. But scholars have their own aspirations, and we cannot force each other. In short, we must draw a clear line and not confuse it." This shows Dr. Sun's serious attitude towards political life.

In 1905, the Tongmenghui was established in Tokyo, with Dr. Sun at its helm. The revolutionary democrats, led by Dr. Sun, further promoted the establishment of a bourgeois democratic republic. The "Minbao," edited by Liao Zhongkai and Zhu Jixin, was the preparatory propaganda base for the revolutionary movement. The reformist "Xinmin Congbao" vigorously advocated constitutional monarchy and spread anti-revolutionary rhetoric, attempting to lead the masses away from the revolutionary path. The reformists claimed that the Chinese people lacked the ability to revolutionize and the qualifications to establish a democratic republic, and that even constitutional monarchy could not be immediately implemented. They advocated a period of training before constitutionalism could be established. They also advocated that revolution would cause chaos and lead to the partition of China. The revolutionary democrats continuously refuted and condemned these fallacies. The debate between the revolutionary and reformist factions was, in essence, a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. Under Dr. Sun's leadership, the political and ideological propaganda of the revolutionary faction had an expanding influence, and the people's demand for change was growing. Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his 1956 article "In Memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen," pointed out: "During the preparatory period of the Chinese democratic revolution, he took a clear stand as a Chinese revolutionary democrat and waged a sharp struggle against the Chinese reformists. In this struggle, he was the flagbearer of the Chinese revolutionary democrats." Chairman Mao gave a very high evaluation of Dr. Sun's revolutionary activities during this period.

Dr. Sun's revolutionary will was resolute and thorough. It was most vividly manifested in his consistent policy of armed struggle against all reactionary forces. He firmly believed that all reactionary ruling classes in history would never voluntarily withdraw from the political stage and that armed revolution must be used to overthrow armed counter-revolution. After the establishment of the Revive China Society, he personally prepared and led ten armed uprisings. These were the 1895 Guangzhou Uprising; the 1900 Huizhou Uprising; the 1907 Chaozhou and Huanggang Uprisings; the 1907 Huizhou Uprising; the 1907 Qin-Lian Uprising; the 1907 Zhanjiang Uprising; the 1908 Qin-Lian Uprising; the 1909 Hekou Uprising; the 1910 Guangzhou New Army Uprising; the March 29, 1911 Guangzhou Uprising; and the October 10, 1911 Wuchang Uprising.

The Wuchang Uprising of 1911 led to a wave of responses from various provinces, overthrowing the Qing government. The feudal imperial system, which had lasted for more than two thousand years, was fundamentally destroyed. This was an event of great historical significance. It dealt a heavy blow to feudalism and imperialism and brought great encouragement and boundless development to the Chinese people. Of course, this victory was not complete, and the democratic republic established by this victory was not genuine. But the revolution ultimately threw the autocratic system into the dustbin of history. Dr. Sun made immortal contributions to the Chinese people in this great historical transformation.

After the Xinhai Revolution, Dr. Sun discovered Yuan Shikai's plot to usurp power and restore the monarchy, and he called for a second revolution, launching the campaign to overthrow Yuan. After Yuan's death, he continued to lead the campaign to protect the constitution. He continued his unyielding struggle. In these struggles, he suffered many setbacks, but he never wavered. He not only had determination but also, at critical moments in the revolution, strictly required self-reform. He found the cause of failure to be his lack of support in his struggle. Therefore, he resolutely overcame the obstruction of the right-wing diehards within the Kuomintang and chose to make a revolutionary transformation in accordance with the times. This was his historic transformation from a revolutionary democrat into a friend of the Communist Party of China. Only someone with a sincere desire to save the country and a clear understanding of the future of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, like Dr. Sun, could achieve this.

Another manifestation of Dr. Sun's revolutionary spirit was his insistence on the struggle against imperialism. As early as 1904, in Hawaii, he publicly expressed his contempt for the imperialist powers. He said, "Have you ever known the cause of the partition? It is because the government is not vigorous and the people are not aroused. If the government is vigorous and the people are aroused, then even a small country like Panama would be recognized by the powers." The Tongmenghui's program of overthrowing the monarchy, establishing a republic, and equalizing land rights was an anti-feudal program and also an anti-imperialist program. Because the Qing government was not only the superstructure of the feudal system but also a tool supported and utilized by foreign imperialists. He believed that as long as the Qing government was overthrown, it would be possible to break free from imperialist slavery.

Due to the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, the power fell into the hands of the Beiyang warlords, and the Republic of China was still under the control of imperialism. Dr. Sun often encouraged everyone, saying, "The revolution is not yet successful, and comrades must continue to strive." In 1924, in the draft declaration of the first National Congress of the Kuomintang, he said: "Before the Xinhai Revolution, the Manchus ruled from above as a single nationality, and the imperialism of the powers also surrounded them, so at that time the national movement aimed to break away from the Manchu ruling policy and the partition policy of the powers. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Manchu ruling policy had been destroyed by the national movement, but the imperialism of the powers still surrounded them, and the partition policy changed to joint management, in other words, military plunder changed to economic oppression, with the result that the Chinese nation lost its independence and freedom. The domestic warlords, in collusion with imperialism, and the bourgeoisie also coveted the remnants, so the Chinese nation's politics and economy were both on the verge of collapse. The Kuomintang, therefore, had to continue to struggle to seek the liberation of the Chinese nation." Dr. Sun, in view of the chaos in China after the Xinhai Revolution, had to make a firm decision and continue to struggle. Dr. Sun's confidence at that time was very high because he had found the source of strength to realize his wish. He firmly believed that the support of the Communist Party of China and the broad masses of workers and peasants was the fundamental guarantee for defeating any powerful enemy. At that time, the Guangzhou government was surrounded by the enemy, and the British imperialists sent warships to Guangzhou to threaten him and incited the comprador Chen Lianbo's merchant corps to stage an armed rebellion, but they did not intimidate Dr. Sun. With the help of the Communist Party of China, he suppressed the incident and foiled the British imperialists' plot.

Dr. Sun devoted forty years of his life to the Chinese revolution. From his early struggles with the reformists to his armed struggles against the Qing dynasty, Yuan Shikai, and the Beiyang warlords, and his consistent struggle against imperialism, the banners he raised were always very clear. He was good at learning from failures, reforming his old ideas, and formulating revolutionary principles born of new ideas. Chairman Mao, in his article "In Memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen," gave a very high evaluation of Dr. Sun's efforts in the revolutionary cause. Chairman Mao said: "He devoted all his energy to the transformation of China and truly worked to the point of exhaustion and death." Dr. Sun dedicated his entire life to the Chinese people's revolution. The road he traveled in his advance was tortuous and fraught with difficulties. But he was always filled with an unyielding and indomitable revolutionary fighting spirit.

Now, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved unprecedented great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. China has become a powerful socialist country standing in the world. China has become the center of the world revolution, and Chairman Mao has become the great leader of the world revolution that the revolutionary people of the world yearn for and support. When we commemorate Dr. Sun's 100th birthday, his lifelong aspirations have already been realized and far surpassed the ideals that the advanced Chinese people had longed for since the Opium War.

We are now in a new stage of the socialist revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres are launching a fierce attack on a handful of capitalists within the party and on all the ghosts and monsters in society, thoroughly smashing the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, and thoroughly establishing the new ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the proletariat, making the spiritual face of the whole society completely new. In the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the seven hundred million people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong will push the productive forces of our country forward by a big step, and from the high tide of cultural construction, promote the high tide of economic construction to leap forward. A new, more prosperous and happy prospect is in sight.

We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must definitely liberate Taiwan and frustrate the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism. We must use the fearless revolutionary spirit and the spirit of continuous progress of Dr. Sun to commemorate him and welcome an unprecedentedly better revolutionary new situation at home and abroad.

    纪念伟大的民主主义革命家孙中山先生
    程潜
    孙中山先生是中国历史上第一个最伟大的民主主义革命家，是一代杰出的革命领袖和民族英雄。他的毕生事业，对于中国人民为解除帝国主义和封建主义的压迫、争取民族独立、民主自由的斗争，有极其重要的意义。我们今天来纪念他的一百周年诞辰，向他表示深切景仰和衷心崇敬。
    中山先生诞生于一八六六年，正当鸦片战争和太平天国失败以后，中国民族处于内外交迫、灾难深重的时代。此时由于外国帝国主义的侵入，中国封建自然经济逐渐解体，中国民族资本主义开始了初步的发展。但帝国主义国家侵略中国的目的，不是要把封建的中国变为资本主义的中国，而是使封建的中国变为殖民地或半殖民地，把中国人民沦于万劫不复、永受奴役的境地。鸦片战争进一步暴露了清朝政府腐朽无能和媚外卖国面目，加深了中国人民与外国侵略者和清朝统治阶级的尖锐矛盾。从此，中国人民不断进行了反对内外敌人的斗争。在中山先生诞生以前的年代，清朝政府为了弥补鸦片战争的损失和支付巨额赔款，加紧用重税掠夺农民，致各地反清斗争，此伏彼起。一八五一年，终于从中国南部开始，爆发了伟大的太平天国革命运动。这个革命在近代中国人民解放斗争史上占有辉煌的一页。但因为这个革命还只是单纯的农民革命，没有先进的社会力量作领导，所以最后遭到了失败。之后，有一部分知识分子和新兴资产阶级为了反对外国侵略者、谋求中国的独立富强，提出了反映要求实现西方资本主义政治经济制度的革新思想。这些思想对中国人民的觉醒和进步，起了一定的作用。但维新运动者看不到广大人民的力量，都只幻想清廷自上而下的革新，不敢提出革命的口号，没有群众基础，所以也失败了。只有由中山先生领导的革命，使得从太平天国和维新运动所开始的事业，向前迈进了一大步。
    中山先生出生在一个贫苦农民的家里。旧中国农村悲惨生活的体验，决定了他一生奋斗的方向。十二岁在檀香山读书时，看到当地人民和殖民者的斗争，产生了反对帝国主义的思想。中法战争时中国人民的反抗斗争和清廷的投降活动，进一步激发了他的爱国主义感情。但是他当时对清朝政府还存在若干幻想。一八九四年他上书李鸿章，提出变法自强的主张。要求“人能尽其才，地能尽其利，物能尽其用，货能畅其流。”李鸿章没有采纳他的意见。同年中日战争爆发，他再次感到国家面临的严重危机，深信只有彻底革命，才是中国的唯一出路。从此，他开始作为一个坚定的革命民主派献身于推翻专制创建共和的伟大革命事业。
    一八九四年秋甲午中日战争之初，中山先生只身到檀香山宣传革命，联络华侨，成立了第一个革命团体兴中会。第二年回到香港，又组设兴中会总会。
    兴中会成立以后，中山先生开始与改良派展开了不调和的斗争。一九○四年在檀香山发表《敬告同乡书》，对康有为、梁启超的保皇派宣传，进行了严肃的抨击。他当时和梁启超感情很好，但他严格划清思想界限。中山先生说：“与任公，私交虽密，一谈政事，则俨然敌国。然士各有志，不能相强。总之，划清界限，不使混淆”。这说明中山先生对待政治生活的严肃态度。
    一九○五年同盟会成立于东京。以中山先生为首的革命民主派进一步开展建立资产阶级民主共和国的宣传。由廖仲凯、朱执信等主持的《民报》，是革命运动的舆论准备阵地。改良派的《新民丛报》，竭力鼓吹君主立宪，散布仇视革命的言论，企图引导群众离开革命的道路。改良派胡说：中国人民没有革命的能力，没有实行民主共和国的资格，连君主立宪，也不可能立刻实行。要先经过训练时期，然后才能立宪。并倡言革命将造成内乱，肇致瓜分祸。革命民主派对这种谬论，不断作了痛斥声讨。革命派和改良派的论战，实际上是革命和反革命的斗争。革命派在中山先生领导之下进行的政治思想宣传，影响一天天扩大，人民要求改制的倾向，日益高涨。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在一九五六年所写《纪念孙中山先生》一文中指出：“他在中国民主革命准备时期，以鲜明的中国革命民主派立场，同中国改良派作了尖锐的斗争。他在这一场斗争中是中国革命民主派的旗帜。”主席对中山先生这一时期的革命活动，作了极高评价。
    中山先生的革命意志是坚决的、彻底的。它集中表现于对一切反动派，始终坚持武装斗争的政策。他深信历史上所有的反动统治阶级，决不会自动退出政治舞台，必须用武装的革命推翻武装的反革命。从兴中会成立后，他曾经亲自准备领导过十一次武装起义。这就是一八九五年的广州起义；一九○○年的惠州起义；一九○七年的潮州、黄冈起义；一九○七年的惠州起义；一九○七年的钦廉起义；一九○七年的镇南关起义；一九○八年的钦廉起义；一九○九年的河口起义；一九一○年的广州新军起义；一九一一年三月二十九日的广州起义；一九一一年十月十日的武昌起义等。
    辛亥武昌起义，各省闻风响应，推翻了清朝政府。延续二千余年的封建帝制，从此根本摧毁。这是一个有伟大历史意义的事件。它给了封建主义和帝国主义一个沉重的打击，为中国人民带来了巨大鼓舞和无穷发展力量。当然，这个胜利是不彻底的，这个胜利所建立起来的民主共和国，是名实不符的。但革命终久把专制制度抛到垃圾堆里。中山先生在这个伟大的历史变革中，为中国人民建树了不朽的功勋。
    辛亥以后，中山先生发现袁世凯帝制自为的窃国阴谋，号召实行第二次革命，发动讨袁战役。袁死以后，又号召领导护法战役。继续进行坚韧不拔的斗争。在这些斗争中，遭到多次失败，但他从不灰心动摇。他所有的不仅是决心，而且是他在革命的关键时刻严格要求自我革新的精神。他找到失败的原因是他缺少支持他进行斗争的力量。因此，他就毅然决然地排除了国民党内右派顽固势力的百般阻挠，选择了顺应时势要求的革命的转变。这就是他从一个革命民主主义者进一步成为中国共产党的朋友这一富有历史意义的转变。这只有抱有真诚的救国愿望，对中国革命和世界革命前途看得清楚的中山先生才能做到。
    中山先生革命精神的另一体现，是他的坚持反帝斗争的精神。早在一九○四年他在檀香山时，就曾公开发表了蔑视帝国主义列强的议论。他说“亦曾知瓜分之原因乎？政府无振作、人民不奋发也。政府有振作，人民能奋发，则微小如巴拿马，列强向之承认也”，“我愈畏缩，则彼愈窥伺。我能发奋，则彼反敬畏。”同盟会提出的推翻帝制、建立民国、平均地权的纲领，是一个反对封建的纲领，也是一个反对帝国主义的纲领。因为清朝统治不仅是封建制度的上层建筑，同时也是外国帝国主义所支持和利用的工具。他认为只要推翻了清朝统治，也就有可能挣脱了帝国主义的奴役。
    由于辛亥革命的失败，政权落于北洋军阀之手，民国以后，中国受帝国主义宰制如故，中山先生经常勉励大家说“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力”。一九二四年他在手订的国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中说：“辛亥以前，满洲以一民族宰制于上，而列强之帝国主义，复从而包围之，故当时民族主义之运动，其作用在脱离满洲之宰制政策与列强之瓜分政策。辛亥以后，满洲之宰制政策，已为国民运动所摧毁，而列强之帝国主义则包围如故，瓜分之说，变为共管，易言之，武力之掠夺，变为经济的压迫而已，其结果足使中国民族失其独立与自由则一也。国内之军阀，既与帝国主义相勾结，而资产阶级亦眈眈然欲起而分其馂余，故中国民族政治上、经济上皆日即于憔悴。国民党人因不得不继续努力，以求中国民族解放”。中山先生鉴于辛亥以后中国的乱源，必须重下决心，作再接再厉的奋斗。中山先生这时的信心是很高的，因为他找到了实现他这个愿望的力量的源泉。他深信中国共产党和广大工农群众的支持，是战胜任何强大敌人的根本。当时的广州政府受到敌人包围，英帝国主义派炮舰到广州对他进行威胁，并煽动买办陈廉伯手下的商团进行武装叛乱，但都没有把中山先生吓倒。他在中国共产党的帮助下，平息了事变，粉碎了英帝国主义的阴谋。
    中山先生为中国革命奋斗了四十年。他从初期与改良派的斗争起到与清朝、袁世凯、北洋军阀的武装斗争以及始终坚持反对帝国主义的历程，他所举起的旗帜都是十分鲜明的。他善于从失败中吸取教训，改造自己的旧思想，制定从新观念中产生的革命原则。毛主席在《纪念孙中山先生》一文中，对中山先生奔走革命的努力，作了很高的评价。主席说：“他全心全意地为了改造中国而耗费了毕生的精力，真是鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”中山先生把一生全部精力献给了中国人民革命。他在前进中所经历的道路是迂回曲折、艰难险阻的。但他始终充满了不屈不挠、愈挫愈坚的革命战斗精神。
    现在，中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的史无前例的巨大胜利。中国已经成为一个强大的社会主义国家屹立于世界。中国已经成为世界革命的中心，毛主席成为全世界革命人民向往、拥戴的世界革命的伟大领袖。当我们纪念中山先生百年诞辰的时候，中山先生生前的抱负早已实现，而且远远超过了从鸦片战争以来先进的中国人所梦寐以求的理想。
    我们正处在社会主义革命的新阶段，广大的工农兵、红卫兵和革命师生、革命干部，正向一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，向社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，使整个的社会精神面貌焕然一新。在无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进展中，用伟大毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民，将把我国的社会生产力更向前推进一大步，使新中国从文化建设的高潮中促进经济建设更跃进的高潮。一个更新的更富强康乐的前景在望。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定要解放台湾、挫败美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。我们要用学习中山先生大无畏的革命精神和不断求进步的精神来纪念中山先生，迎接空前未有的国内外更好的革命新形势。
