Vietnamese "People's Daily" and "New Vietnam Chinese Daily" have published articles enthusiastically praising the great communist warrior Cai Yongxiang.

Hanoi, November 21 (Xinhua) - On November 20, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a report on the heroic deeds of Cai Yongxiang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, who sacrificed himself while rescuing and transporting a special train for the Red Guards during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The report is titled: "The Brave Example of Cai Yongxiang, a Soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." The report enthusiastically praises Cai Yongxiang, a great communist who is selfless and devoted to the public, as "a hero like Ouyang Hai, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and a good son of the Chinese people." The report states that Cai Yongxiang learned from the examples of heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, and Liu Yingjun, dedicating his youth to the Chinese people. His heroic deeds inspire the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The report says that even if one Cai Yongxiang sacrifices himself, there will emerge countless heroes like Cai Yongxiang.

Recently, the "New Vietnam Chinese Daily" in Hanoi also reported on Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds and fully reprinted the notice from the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army calling on the entire army to widely publicize and learn from the glorious deeds of Comrade Cai Yongxiang, as well as related articles from the "Liberation Army Daily" and the "People's Daily."
