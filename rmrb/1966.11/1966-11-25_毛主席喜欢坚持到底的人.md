We are not far from Beijing now. We have heard the news that Chairman Mao will soon receive the revolutionary youngsters. Should we go by car or continue to walk to Beijing? We say:

Chairman Mao loves those who persevere to the end.

Our team is marching forward. A classmate is holding high a portrait of Chairman Mao, striding forward with resolute steps at the very front. "Comrades, come on! We are only about a hundred miles from Beijing!" The songs in our team are even more lively, and our steps are even faster.

At this moment, one car after another is speeding past us on the road, heading towards Beijing.

A soldier on a truck told us some exciting news: "Chairman Mao will receive the revolutionary students and teachers tomorrow. Get on our truck quickly!" This news was like a clap of spring thunder, and the team immediately became excited. We have traveled thousands of miles to Beijing, and the first big thing is to see our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! And tomorrow, Chairman Mao will receive the revolutionary students and teachers!

"Get on the car," a classmate couldn't help but propose. Indeed, if we get on the car, we can see Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square tomorrow. But this proposal did not get a response from the classmates. Zhou Xiuying, the daughter of a poor peasant, is the most eager to see Chairman Mao. Why is she silent now? Li Lingtian, the son of a martyr, loves Chairman Mao the most. For the sake of walking to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, his two feet are blistered, but why is he silent now? The team members did not speak, but everyone's hearts were engaged in a fierce struggle.

"Why are you silent? Are you getting on the car or not?" The classmate who proposed the idea spoke again.

"No, we cannot get on the car!" Li Lingtian and Zhou Xiuying almost shouted in unison.

"Why can't we get on the car? Is there anything more important than seeing Chairman Mao?"

"Longing to see Chairman Mao is understandable. But have you thought about why we want to see Chairman Mao? How should we go to see Chairman Mao? Chairman Mao does not like those who give up halfway. Chairman Mao loves those who persevere in the revolution to the end!"

"Yes, our Long March cannot be given up halfway. We must walk the entire journey on foot and go to Chairman Mao's side!"

The struggle in thought ended like this. "Be those who persevere to the end," this was the conclusion of everyone.

Everyone continued to muster courage and stride forward towards Beijing. The red flag in front is fluttering in the wind, guiding us towards Chairman Mao.

### 毛主席喜欢坚持到底的人

    离北京不远了，听到了毛主席即将接见革命小将的消息，是坐车赶去？还是继续徒步走到北京？我们说：
    毛主席喜欢坚持到底的人
    我们的队伍在行进，一个同学高举着毛主席像，迈着坚定的步伐走在最前面。“同志们，加油啊，离北京只有一百多里路了！”队伍里歌声更加响亮，步伐更加快了。
    这时候，公路上一辆又一辆的汽车，从我们身边飞驰而过，向着北京的方向驶去。
    一辆卡车上的一位解放军同志，告诉了我们一个激动人心的消息：“毛主席明天就要接见革命师生了，你们快上我们的车吧！”这个消息，好像一声春雷，队伍里顿时沸腾了。我们千里跋涉赶往北京，第一件大事不就是看望我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席吗？而明天毛主席就要接见革命师生了！
      “坐上汽车吧”，一个同学禁不住提出了倡议。是呵，只要坐上汽车，明天就能在天安门广场看到毛主席了。可是，这个倡议却得不到同学们的响应。周秀英，这个贫农的女儿，她是最急于要见毛主席的，为什么此刻她不吭声呢？李领田，这个烈士的儿子，他对毛主席最热爱，为了步行到北京看望毛主席，他的两只脚都磨破了，而此刻他为什么也不吭声呢？队员们没有发言，但是，大家的内心里正在进行着激烈的思想斗争。
      “你们为什么不作声？到底坐不坐车子？”那位提出倡议的同学又说话了。
      “不，不能坐车！”李领田和周秀英同学几乎是同时喊了起来。
      “为什么不能坐车？有什么事比看望毛主席更重要的？”
      “渴望见到毛主席，这是可以理解的。但是，你想过没有，我们为什么要见毛主席？我们应该怎样去见毛主席？毛主席不喜欢半途而废的人，毛主席喜欢坚持革命到底的人！”
      “对，我们的长征不能半途而废，我们一定要徒步走完全程，走到毛主席身旁去！”
    一场思想斗争就这样结束了。“做坚持到底的人”，这就是大家的结论。
    大家继续鼓足勇气，大踏步地向北京挺进。红旗在前面迎风招展，引导着我们走向毛主席的身边。
