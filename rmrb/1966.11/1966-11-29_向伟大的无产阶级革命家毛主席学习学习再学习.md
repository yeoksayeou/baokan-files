The great leader's eight receptions of revolutionary youngsters ignite nationwide enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works

	We must learn, learn, and learn again from the great proletarian revolutionary leader Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao advocates, we will do; whatever Chairman Mao praises, we will learn; whatever Chairman Mao criticizes, we will correct; whatever Chairman Mao opposes, we will fight against it.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's eighth reception of revolutionary youngsters has ignited an even greater revolutionary fervor among the broad masses of revolutionaries fighting on various fronts across the country to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They are determined to raise the level of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high.

	In just over three months, Chairman Mao has received over 11 million cultural revolutionaries, a feat unprecedented in the history of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement, and a brilliant victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses say that as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution continues to develop favorably, we must first study and apply Chairman Mao's works even better to achieve even greater victories. We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, especially to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our guiding principles, to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to change our worldview with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from victory to greater victory.

	Inspired by Chairman Mao's consecutive receptions of the cultural revolution armies, the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, Red Guards, and neighborhood residents across the country have held meetings, discussions, put up blackboard newspapers, written poems, and sung songs, expressing their determination to better study, execute, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, to make Mao Zedong Thought their soul, and to strive to be selfless communists. They have also held lectures and reports, sharing their experiences and insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many active learners of Chairman Mao's works have further revised their study plans for Chairman Mao's works, making new arrangements to study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles." The broad revolutionary masses are determined to turn Chairman Mao's great encouragement into the driving force to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to read Chairman Mao's books for life, to listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, to reform their thoughts for life, and to revolutionize for life with Chairman Mao.

	The broad masses of workers on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, together with millions of revolutionary youngsters, share the immense happiness and greatest honor of Chairman Mao's eight receptions of the cultural revolution armies. They love Chairman Mao even more, love Chairman Mao's works even more, and have deeper feelings for Mao Zedong Thought. They declare: We must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially using the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our guiding principles, to be good workers of Chairman Mao. The 1202 drilling team of the Daqing Oilfield completed the 50,000-meter drilling target set at the beginning of the year in just over five months, creating the highest drilling level in the world. Recently, the entire team underwent training, intensively studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles." After the training, the team members are more united and enthusiastic, drilling the straightest and highest-quality well of the year. They say, we not only dare to fight and advance on the material front, but we must also strive ten times harder on the spiritual front to be pioneers. On the 25th, when the workers of the Tianjin Second Garment Factory saw our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao on television, many people excitedly said: We have stood by Chairman Mao again. Seeing him, we think of Comrade Lin Biao's great call: We must truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Shanghai Third Steel Plant's model worker and young furnace master Wang Mingzhang said, Chairman Mao's eight receptions of revolutionary youngsters have made them love Chairman Mao even more and love Chairman Mao's works even more. Many workers carry the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, always following Chairman Mao's teachings, comparing their thoughts, and determining to further break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, forever following Chairman Mao through storms and waves. The party branch leader of the Zhao Mengtao group in Xi'an City's Northwest Cotton Mill No. 1, Wu Guixian, said, we must study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our first necessity in life, as a compulsory course to reform our worldview, and we must develop the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous battle, driving out the "self" and letting the "public" settle down.

	The broad poor and lower-middle peasants say with immense happiness, Chairman Mao understands us the most, and his heart is closest to ours. We must read Chairman Mao's books better. Reading Chairman Mao's books lights an eternal red lamp in our hearts, so we won't lose direction in class struggle, and we'll have endless energy in production struggle. Wang Fuyuan, a member of the Dongfanghong Brigade of Hongqi Commune in the suburbs of Urumqi City and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said, I love reading Chairman Mao's books the most. I can't read, but I have ears and a brain. I remember Chairman Mao's words the best, learn them the best, and use them the best because Chairman Mao's words are all truths. The members of Huangshandong Brigade of Shibadian Commune in Boluo County, a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works in Guangdong Province, said, every family in our brigade studies the "Three Constantly Read Articles," recites the "Three Constantly Read Articles," applies the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and sings the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Whatever Chairman Mao advocates, we will do; whatever Chairman Mao criticizes, we will correct; whatever Chairman Mao praises, we will learn; whatever Chairman Mao opposes, we will fight against it. We have only one resolution: to listen to Chairman Mao's words and be good farmers of Chairman Mao for generations. The members of Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi Province said, this year Dazhai suffered the rare five disasters of drought, flood, waterlogging, pests, and wind. However, the members studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" intensively, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, grasped revolution to promote production, and achieved three harvests of ideology, grain, and agricultural basic construction. The broad masses of community members affectionately call the "Three Constantly Read Articles" the "Red Three Articles," the "Ten-Thousand-Year Three Articles," the good three articles for fighting against heaven, fighting against earth, increasing production, learning from people, and changing the brigade. They are determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to never let Chairman Mao's words leave their mouths, to never let Mao Zedong Thought leave their minds, to never let their actions leave Chairman Mao's instructions, and to follow Chairman Mao's instructions for life.

	The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards excitedly say: Chairman Mao has great expectations for our young generation. The Chinese revolution needs us, and the world revolution needs us. Revolution can only be done with Mao Zedong Thought. We must be good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and the most fundamental thing is to succeed Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to learn from and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to revolutionize in the depths of their souls, and to establish a communist worldview of living for revolution and dying for revolution, being selfless. Many revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guard youngsters who are on the march or preparing to set out have turned the encouragement of Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary youngsters into a great driving force, making plans to learn, learn, and learn again from the great leader Chairman Mao. The "Baiqien Long March Team" of the Baiqien Medical School in Qinghai Province, composed of 25 male and female revolutionary youngsters from the Han, Tibetan, Hui, and Manchu ethnic groups, is determined to take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their guiding principles during the Long March, not only to temper and reform themselves through wind and rain but also to guarantee that wherever they go, they will spread Mao Zedong Thought there, letting the great Mao Zedong Thought take root, sprout, bloom, and bear fruit everywhere. The Red Guards of the Yan'an Art School in Liaoning Province, who are preparing to march, are on one hand arming their minds with Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points," and on the other hand actively preparing artistic performances to sing the praises of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the Cultural Revolution. They are determined to make their Long March Team a propaganda team and a sowing machine for Mao Zedong Thought, spreading Mao Zedong Thought to every place along the way.

    凡是毛主席提倡的，我们就做；凡是毛主席表扬的，我们就学；凡是毛主席批评的，我们就改；凡是毛主席反对的，我们就同它斗。
    据新华社二十八日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席第八次接见革命小将，激起了战斗在全国各地不同岗位上的广大革命群众更好地活学活用毛主席著作的巨大革命热情。他们决心在无产阶级文化大革命中，把毛主席著作学出新水平，用出新水平，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的高潮。
    毛主席在短短三个多月中先后接见一千一百多万文化革命大军，是中国革命和国际共产主义运动史上前所未有的伟大创举，是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。广大革命群众说，在无产阶级文化大革命越来越好的形势下，我们要进一步夺取更大的胜利，首先就要进一步学好用好毛主席著作。我们坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，特别是要把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，破私立公，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神改造世界观，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，推动无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    各地广大工农群众、革命干部、革命师生和红卫兵小将以及街道居民，在毛主席连续接见文化革命大军的鼓舞下，纷纷集会座谈，出黑板报，写诗作歌，表示一定要更好地学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，努力做一个一心为公的共产主义战士。他们还举行讲用会、报告会，交流学用毛主席著作的心得、体会。许多活学活用毛主席著作积极分子进一步修订了学习毛主席著作的计划，对学好用好“老三篇”做出新的安排。广大革命群众决心把毛主席的巨大鼓舞，化为更好地活学活用毛主席著作的动力，一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子听毛主席的话，一辈子改造思想，跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
    站在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动第一线的广大工人群众，和千百万革命小将一起，分享了毛主席八次接见文化革命大军的无比幸福和最大光荣。他们更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛主席著作，对毛泽东思想的感情更深了。他们表示：一定要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，特别是要以“老三篇”作座右铭，做一个毛主席的好工人。大庆油田1202钻井队今年五个多月完成了年初提出的五万米的钻井目标，创造了世界钻井的最高水平。最近全队进行整训，活学狠用“老三篇”。整训后，全队队员心更齐，干劲更大，一举打出今年最直的一口优质井。他们表示，我们不但要在物质战线上敢打敢冲，而且更要以十倍的努力，在改造灵魂的精神战线上当一名闯将。二十五日，当天津第二服装厂工人在电视中看到最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的时候，许多人激动地说：我们又站在毛主席他老人家身边来了。看到他老人家，我们就想到林彪同志的伟大号召：我们一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手。上海第三钢厂五好工人、青年炉长汪明章说，毛主席八次接见革命小将，使他们更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛主席著作。很多工人把“老三篇”和《毛主席语录》一起带在身上，随时按照毛主席的教导，对照自己的思想，决心进一步破私立公，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中奋勇前进。西安市西北国棉一厂赵梦桃小组党小组长吴桂贤说，要把“老三篇”当作生活第一需要，当作改造世界观的必修课来学，就要发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，把“私”字扫地出门，让“公”字安家落户。
    广大贫农下中农怀着无比幸福的心情说，毛主席最了解我们，他的心和我们靠得最紧。我们一定要更好地读毛主席的书。读了毛主席的书，心中就挂上了永不熄灭的红灯，搞阶级斗争就不会迷失方向，搞生产斗争就有用不完的劲。乌鲁木齐市郊红星公社东方红大队社员、学习毛主席著作积极分子王福元说，我最爱读毛主席的书，我不识字，但我有耳朵，有脑子，毛主席的话我最能记得住，学得会，用得上，因为毛主席的话句句是真理。广东省学习毛主席著作先进单位、博罗县石坝公社黄山洞大队的社员们说，我们家家学习“老三篇”，背“老三篇”，用“老三篇”，唱“老三篇”。凡是毛主席提倡的，我们就做；凡是毛主席批评的，我们就改；凡是毛主席表扬的，我们就学；凡是毛主席反对的，我们就同它斗。我们只有一个决心：世世代代听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好农民。山西省大寨大队社员们说，今年大寨遭到了历史上少见的旱、洪、涝、虫、风五大灾害。但是社员们大学“老三篇”，按毛主席的指示办事，抓革命促生产，结果获得了思想、粮食、农田基本建设三丰收。广大社员以自己的亲身经历，亲切地称“老三篇”为“红三篇”、“万岁三篇”，是战天天低头、斗地地增产、人学人心红、队学队变样的“好三篇”。他们决心要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，做到嘴里不离毛主席的话，脑子里不离毛泽东思想，行动不离毛主席的指示，照毛主席指示干一辈子。
    广大革命师生和红卫兵激动地说：毛主席对我们青年一代寄以无限的期望。中国革命需要我们，世界革命需要我们。干革命只有靠毛泽东思想。我们要当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人，最根本的是接好毛泽东思想的班。他们决心以雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥等共产主义战士为榜样，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，学好用好“老三篇”，在灵魂深处闹革命，树立起生为革命生，死为革命死，一心为公的共产主义世界观。许多正在步行串连途中和整装待发的革命师生和红卫兵小将，把毛主席又一次接见革命小将受到的鼓舞化为巨大动力，订出了向伟大领袖毛主席学习学习再学习的计划。青海省白求恩卫生学校由汉、藏、回、满四个民族二十五个男女革命小将组成的“白求恩长征队”，决心在长征途中以“老三篇”为座右铭，不仅要在长征中经风雨见世面，锻炼自己改造自己，还保证走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想传播到哪里，让伟大的毛泽东思想到处生根、发芽、开花、结果。正在准备步行串连的辽宁延安文艺学校的红卫兵，一方面用毛主席著作和十六条进一步武装自己的头脑，另一方面积极准备歌颂“老三篇”、歌颂文化大革命的文艺节目。他们决心使自己的长征队成为毛泽东思想的宣传队、播种机，把毛泽东思想传播到沿途的每一个地方。
