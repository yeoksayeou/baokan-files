The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee has received congratulatory messages or telegrams from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bolivia, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand, N. Samugathasan, a member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninists), and the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee delegation led by Yusuf Adjitorop, warmly congratulating China on the successful test launch of missiles and nuclear weapons and praising the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bolivia stated that this victory is a victory for the thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong, the undisputed leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, a victory for Marxism-Leninism over modern revisionism, American imperialism, and other reactionary forces, and a victory for all the oppressed and enslaved peoples of the world. It is also a victory for all Marxist-Leninist brother parties. The message further stated, "We Marxist-Leninists also believe that only by arming ourselves can world peace be guaranteed. The 'peaceful coexistence' and 'peaceful competition' touted by the Soviet revisionist capitulationists who usurped the power of the Soviet people and betrayed Marxism-Leninism are nothing but deceptions."

The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand stated that China's new achievements are glorious results of the Cultural Revolution and another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They further strengthen China as a bastion of the world revolution, benefit the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism, benefit the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and benefit the armed struggle of the Thai people against American imperialism and the fascist reactionary government of Thanom. The message also said, "China's great achievements have broken the monopoly of the U.S.-Soviet reactionary alliance on missiles and nuclear weapons, shattered the illusions of the U.S.-Soviet reactionary alliance's cooperation to dominate the world, and dealt another severe blow to the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionists."

The congratulatory message from N. Samugathasan, a member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon, stated, "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have learned to strategically despise imperialism and all reactionaries. The victory of the Chinese people has given us more confidence to soon defeat international imperialism. The days when American imperialism can intimidate the oppressed peoples of the world with nuclear blackmail are gone. The dream of the Soviet revisionist group to prevent China from becoming a nuclear power has been shattered. The nuclear weapons in the hands of the People's Republic of China will become a powerful weapon for struggling for peace and the liberation of the oppressed peoples. This is a powerful blow to international imperialism and modern revisionism."

The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninists) stated, "Our Party Central Committee emphasizes that the statement of the Communist Party of China is true: once the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought and apply it creatively, an extremely great revolutionary force will be generated that makes the imperialists and revisionists tremble with fear. We are delighted that the new leap of the Chinese people has made a decisive contribution to the struggle of the peoples of all countries for the final victory against imperialism, first and foremost to the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people."

The congratulatory telegram from the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee delegation led by Yusuf Adjitorop stated, "The launch of this missile has been warmly welcomed and taken pride in by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world who are fighting, especially greatly encouraging and doubling the fighting spirit of the Indonesian people and Indonesian communists who are struggling to smash the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world completely believe that China has become a beacon, bastion, and center of the world revolution. This successful missile launch has dealt a huge blow to American imperialism and its accomplices—the modern revisionists led by the Soviet leadership and the reactionaries of various countries."

    五个兄弟党热烈祝贺我国发射导弹核武器试验成功
    中国的成就使美苏合作主宰世界的迷梦破灭
    新华社九日讯　中国共产党中央委员会收到了玻利维亚共产党中央委员会，泰国共产党中央委员会，锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记纳·桑穆加塔桑，意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会和印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团优素福·阿吉托罗普分别发来的贺信或贺电，热烈祝贺我国发射导弹核武器试验成功，热烈赞颂毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利。
    玻共中央的贺信指出，这个胜利是中国人民和全世界无疑的领袖毛泽东主席的思想的胜利，是反对现代修正主义、美帝国主义和其他反动势力的马列主义科学的胜利，也是全世界被压迫、被奴役的人民的胜利，是所有马列主义兄弟党的胜利。贺信还说：“我们马克思列宁主义者也相信，只有我们武装起来，世界和平才能有保障。篡夺了苏联人民的政权和背叛了马列主义的苏共修正主义投降分子到处吹嘘的‘和平共处’、‘和平竞赛’，只不过是骗人的东西。”
    泰共中央的贺信指出，中国的新成就是文化大革命的辉煌成果，是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，它更加巩固了中国这个世界革命的堡垒，有利于全世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的革命斗争，有利于亚非拉人民的民族解放运动，也有利于泰国人民反美、反他侬法西斯反动政府的武装斗争。贺信还说，中国的这一伟大成就“打破了美苏反动联盟对导弹和核武器的垄断，使美苏反动联盟合作主宰世界的迷梦沦于破灭，又一次严重地打击了以苏修为中心的现代修正主义者”。
    锡共中央政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑的贺信说：“在毛泽东思想的指导下，我们已学会在战略上藐视帝国主义和一切反动派。中国人民的这次胜利使我们更有信心不久战胜国际帝国主义。美帝国主义可以用核讹诈吓倒世界被压迫人民的日子，已经一去不复返了。苏联修正主义集团阻止中国成为核大国的迷梦已经破灭了。”“掌握在中华人民共和国手中的核武器将成为争取和平、争取被压迫人民解放的巨大武器。这是对国际帝国主义和现代修正主义的最有力的一次打击。”
    意共（马列主义）中央的贺电中说：“我们党中央委员会强调指出中国共产党的这一论断是真理，即：一旦群众掌握了毛泽东思想并且创造性地运用它，就会产生使帝国主义者和修正主义者胆战心惊的极其伟大的革命力量。”“我们党中央委员会为中国人民的新的跃进对各国人民争取反对帝国主义斗争最后胜利的事业、首先是对英雄的越南人民的斗争而作出的决定性贡献，感到欢欣鼓舞。”
    印尼共中央委员会代表团优素福·阿吉托罗普的贺电说：“这个导弹的发射受到了亚洲、非洲和全世界正在进行斗争的人民的热烈欢欣和引为自豪，特别是大大地鼓舞和成倍地增强了正在为粉碎苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权而斗争的印尼人民和印尼共产党人的斗争精神。亚洲、非洲和全世界人民完全相信，中国已成为世界革命的灯塔、堡垒和中心。这次发射导弹成功给美帝国主义及其同谋者——以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义者以及各国的反动派以巨大的打击。”
