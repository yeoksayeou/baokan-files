Our athletes in Phnom Penh strive for the noble goal of promoting friendship, unity, and anti-imperialism.

On the 18th, during the joint celebration between Chinese and Cambodian athletes, Chinese athletes introduced Chairman Mao's works and shared their experiences of studying Mao Zedong Thought with the Cambodian athletes.

The great fighting friendship binds the peoples of China and Vietnam closely together. This is a scene of Chinese and Vietnamese track and field athletes having a friendly chat on the sports field in Phnom Penh. During the joint celebration, athletes from China and Cambodia sang "The East Is Red" in unison.
