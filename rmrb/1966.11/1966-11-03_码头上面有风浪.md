Title: Storms on the Wharf

The wharf is not calm; there are storms. The Beijing opera "Harbor" vividly illustrates how the defeated exploiting class is unwilling to die. They use "soft" methods to try to win over our young generation. Look, how "concerned" Mr. Qian is for Han Xiaqiang: he fears that Han will overwork himself, advising him to drop his urgent tasks and rest more; he worries about Han's future, urging him to request a transfer to pursue fame and fortune; he worries about Han's life, letting him skip meetings to go watch movies; when Han is troubled by the scattered package incident, he advises him to "take it easy" and not admit his mistake. The list goes on and on. Who says there are no storms on the wharf? Class struggle is fiercely waged even in casual conversations.

Watching this play gave me a deep class education. I recall when I first started working on the wharf, the over one hundred young people who came with me made rapid progress under the meticulous care of the Party and old workers. However, there were also a few people like Mr. Qian who pretended to care for the youth, poisoning us with talk of how "high school graduates working on the wharf is a waste of talent" and "why bother with heavy physical labor at such a young age?" They used bourgeois ideology to corrupt us.

At that time, I was somewhat like the young wharf worker Han Xiaqiang in "Harbor," unwilling to do loading work and thinking the wharf job was too simple. Later, after repeatedly studying the "Three Articles" and linking them to the actual class struggle and production struggle on the wharf, I came to realize that today, working on the wharf is not just about moving things around; it is about revolution. We are not just moving goods; we are moving "bullets" to strike down American imperialism and modern revisionism. Every time I connect moving goods with the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, I feel more energized.

Watching this play also made me realize that only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can we recognize the enemy's true face and stand firm in the fierce and complex class struggle, forever holding high the red flag.

    码头上面有风浪
    上海港第三装卸区青年装卸工　许其祥
    京剧《海港》中钱守维对青年工人韩小强的侵蚀，生动地说明了已被打倒的剥削阶级绝不甘心死亡，他们以一种“软”的手段来争夺我们的年青一代。看，姓钱的对韩小强是多么“关心”呀：“怕”他累着了，劝他丢下紧张的抢运任务，自己多休息一会；“关心”他的前途，怂恿他要求调动工作去追求名利；“关心”他的生活，让他不参加会议而去看电影；当他为散包事故苦恼的时候，又劝他“宽心”，千万不要自己认错，如此等等，举不胜举。谁说码头上面无风浪？阶级斗争就是这样在说说笑笑之间激烈地进行着。
    看了这出戏，使我受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。回忆我刚踏上码头工作时的情景，我们一起来的一百多个青年，在党和老工人的无微不至的关怀下，进步很快。但也有个别像钱守维那样的人，装作一副“关心青年”的样子，向我们大放其毒，说什么“高中毕业生当码头工人是大材小用”啦，“年纪轻轻为啥不学点技术，偏要做重体力劳动”啦，他们用资产阶级的思想来腐蚀我们。
    我当时就有些像《海港》中的青年码头工人韩小强，不愿干装卸工，嫌码头工作简单。后来反复学了“老三篇”，联系码头上阶级斗争和生产斗争的实际，才认识到今天我们干码头工作，不是简单的搬搬运运，而是干革命。我们搬的不仅仅是一件件货物，而是一颗颗打击美帝国主义和现代修正主义的“枪弹”。每当我把搬运货物同中国革命和世界革命挂上了钩的时候，就越干越有劲。
    看了这出戏，更使我认识到，只有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，才能识别阶级敌人的面目，才能在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争风浪中站稳脚跟，永远保持鲜红的旗帜。
