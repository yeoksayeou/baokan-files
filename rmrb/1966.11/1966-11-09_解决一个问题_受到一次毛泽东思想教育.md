Over the past year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Guangzhou Military Region, following the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, has widely promoted the "How To" methods for addressing active thoughts compiled by the political department of a certain regiment. Various units have studied and applied these methods, greatly promoting the in-depth development of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, ensuring the implementation of political and ideological work, advancing the revolutionization of people's thoughts, and guaranteeing the vigorous development of all work. Recently, during the exchange of experiences, the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers unanimously praised the "How To" methods, pointing out: addressing active thoughts means using Mao Zedong Thought to solve real-life ideological problems. Solving one problem is receiving one education in Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, Mao Zedong Thought will deeply take root in one's mind and can be quickly mastered and truly grasped.

Last November 9, Comrade Lin Biao gave a high evaluation of the "How To" methods for addressing active thoughts, stating: "The political department of this regiment, through in-depth work in the companies, summarized over sixty 'How To' methods for addressing active thoughts, providing specific methods for using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to address active thoughts. This is an innovation with important significance for strengthening the education to promote the elimination of bourgeois ideology and for enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops, and it is worth promoting throughout the army." Later, he gave two more instructions to advocate and promote these methods in the troops. The Guangzhou Military Region, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, on one hand, led by leading cadres, sent work teams to the companies to investigate and research, mobilizing the broad ranks of cadres to exchange their experiences and insights on addressing active thoughts, further summarizing and compiling the "Over Sixty 'How To' Methods for Addressing Active Thoughts." On the other hand, it widely propagated these methods in the troops, introducing experiences, making the "Over Sixty 'How To' Methods" known to everyone and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Once the "Over Sixty 'How To' Methods" were promoted, they were warmly welcomed by the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers. Cadres generally reflected that the methods proposed in the "How To" are detailed and reasonable, both theoretical and practical, very suitable for us to study and apply, and are good advisors for addressing active thoughts. Soldiers unanimously agreed that they are like little political instructors and little guides for solving their own ideological problems. Many political instructors, upon receiving the "Over Sixty 'How To' Methods for Addressing Active Thoughts" printed and distributed by the General Political Department, happily said: The party calls on us to use Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything, promote everything, and transform everything. The "How To" methods are good guides, making work more convenient. A deputy political instructor, Xiao Tiefu, from a certain unit, when talking about his experience in studying and applying the "How To" methods, said: "This autumn, I changed from being a deputy company commander to a deputy political instructor and was initially worried about not being able to do political and ideological work. After learning the 'How To' methods, even problems I had never seen or handled before had solutions. The over sixty 'How To' methods are like sixty golden keys, and they work every time you use them."

Through a year of practice, many units recently exchanged experiences in promoting and applying the "How To" methods. The cadres and soldiers unanimously agreed that implementing the "How To" methods is to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. They said: Whether it's dozens of "How To" methods, hundreds of "How To" methods, a thousand "How To" methods, or ten thousand "How To" methods, they all come down to using Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything, promote everything, and transform everything. It is like using the arrow of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the target of the troops' real-life thoughts. They pointed out that when the "How To" methods were initially promoted, some units and individuals treated the "How To" methods as regulations, orders, or textbooks. They would rush to match problems without first clarifying their nature, characteristics, and causes, resulting in poor effects. They said: The "How To" methods have thousands of techniques, but the first technique is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. Without this technique, the "How To" methods lose their soul. A certain unit's medical team realized: The process of applying the "How To" methods is the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. In their treatment and prevention work, they found that some chronic patients, such as those with headaches, backaches, leg pain, stomachaches, and chest pain, had lost their will to be treated. These people could not be solved by medication alone. They applied the methods proposed in the "How To," repeatedly organizing these comrades to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's letter to Comrade Wang Guanglian, introducing vivid examples of how the older generation fought against diseases, thereby helping them establish a correct outlook on life and death, and inspiring them to fight against diseases. This greatly improved the medical effects. They said: The "How To" methods are methods, and the goal is to make Mao Zedong Thought take root in people's minds through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. Without this goal, promoting and applying the "How To" methods would lead to the wrong path.

Many units, when exchanging experiences, pointed out: The key to implementing the "How To" methods lies in the revolutionization of the thoughts of the party committees, organs, and cadres. Many cadres and soldiers pointed out that the "How To" methods are a dialectical materialist working method. If the party committees, organs, and cadres do not have the style of deepening their understanding of reality, connecting with the masses, investigating and researching, and doing painstaking and detailed ideological work, they cannot promote or apply the "How To" methods. They realized from practice that the process of promoting and applying the "How To" methods is the process of transforming thoughts and achieving thought revolutionization. In the past, some comrades thought that summarizing the "How To" methods required repeated practice and research, which was indeed not easy, but promoting and applying the "How To" methods was not so laborious; just follow the methods. Some comrades, when doing ideological work, treated the "How To" methods as textbooks. Whenever someone had an ideological problem, they would simply read the "How To" methods to them, attempting to solve problems without doing painstaking work. Everyone agreed that this was lazy thinking and metaphysics, and the "How To" methods could never be applied well in this way. How can one use the "How To" methods to address others' active thoughts? They said: First, one must address their own active thoughts. First, one must revolutionize themselves. A certain unit's political instructor, Chen Houzhong, when helping a backward soldier, followed the spirit of the "How To" methods. First, he studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the attitude of communists towards backward comrades, examined his own lack of deep class feelings towards backward soldiers, and his fear of doing painstaking work. Then, he reminisced about hardships and sweetness with this backward soldier, studied the "Three Articles," and finally helped this soldier join the advanced ranks. He deeply felt that the process of applying the "How To" methods is the process of transforming thoughts. Only by continuously transforming thoughts, establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, and having a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause, can one truly master and apply the "How To" methods.

When summarizing and exchanging experiences, many units also pointed out: The "How To" methods originated from the masses and from practice, and promoting and developing the "How To" methods also rely on the masses and practice. Everyone agreed that without the masses, only a few people would be busy, making the promotion and development of the "How To" methods very difficult and turning it into empty talk. Initially, some people did not fully understand this issue. They thought that the "How To" methods were tools given to cadres and backbones to address others' active thoughts, and that as long as the cadres were mobilized, it would be fine. Some people even opposed the promotion of the "How To" methods to the masses. Everyone pointed out that the masses are the practitioners themselves, and they best understand their own active thoughts, have the most knowledge, and have the best methods. Our politics are the politics of the masses. Without believing in the masses and relying on the masses, nothing can be done well. The masses have a certain level of political awareness, and once they grasp the correct thoughts, they will become a great material force. Some political instructors introduced their experiences and lessons. Initially, they did not dare to give the "How To" methods to the masses, fearing that the masses, once they grasped the "How To" methods, would trouble the cadres. Although the party branch held several meetings, emphasizing the need to firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to vigorously promote the "How To" methods, and organized cadres to study several times, they still moved like a woman with bound feet, unable to take big steps. After half a year of promotion, they had not used a few. Later, following Chairman Mao's instructions and teachings, they gave the "How To" methods to the masses for discussion, mobilizing everyone to think of methods and jointly promote them, quickly forming a high tide throughout the company. In less than a month, they promoted fifteen or sixteen "How To" methods. The masses not only helped the cadres address active thoughts but also used the "How To" methods to address their own active thoughts. This year, the soldiers have published nine issues of special editions of wall newspapers on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and addressing their own active thoughts, greatly promoting the revolutionization of the troops' thoughts.

From a large number of facts, everyone deeply realized that promoting, implementing, and developing the "How To" methods must rely on the masses. As long as the masses are mobilized, the promotion and implementation of the "How To" methods will have a solid foundation and can be continuously enriched and developed.

### 解决一个问题　受到一次毛泽东思想教育

    广大干部战士同声称赞“怎么办”好得很
    解决一个问题　受到一次毛泽东思想教育
    广州部队根据林彪同志指示，广泛推广某团政治处抓活思想的六十多个“怎么办”，大大促进了人的思想革命化
    新华社广州八日电　一年来，中国人民解放军广州部队根据林彪同志的指示，广泛推广了某团政治处总结的抓活思想的六十多个“怎么办”。各部队学习和运用了“怎么办”的经验后，大大地推动了活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的深入发展，推动了政治思想工作的更加落实，促进了人的思想革命化，保证了各项工作的蓬勃发展。最近，广大指战员在交流经验时，同声称赞“怎么办”好得很，一致指出：抓活思想，就是用毛泽东思想解决现实思想问题，解决一个问题，受到一次毛泽东思想教育，这样，毛泽东思想就会在头脑里深深扎根，就能很快学到手，真正掌握起来。
    去年十一月九日，林彪同志对抓活思想的六十多个“怎么办”作了很高的评价，指出：“这个团政治处深入连队总结的六十多个‘怎么办’，提供了以毛泽东思想为武器抓活思想的具体办法，是一个创举，对加强兴无灭资的教育和提高部队战斗力有重要作用，值得在全军加以推广。”以后，又两次指示，要在部队提倡和推广。广州部队根据林彪同志的指示，一方面，由领导干部率领工作组深入连队，调查研究，发动广大干部交流抓活思想的心得体会，进一步总结和整理了《抓活思想的六十多个怎么办》。一方面，在部队广泛传播，介绍经验，使六十多个“怎么办”家喻户晓，深入人心。
    六十多个“怎么办”一推广，就受到广大指战员的欢迎。干部们普遍反映：“怎么办”提出的办法，深入细致，合情合理，既有理论原则，又有具体办法，很适合于我们学习和运用，是抓活思想的“好参谋”、“好顾问”。战士们一致认为它是解决自己思想问题的“小指导员”、“小辅导员”。许多指导员领到总政治部印发的《抓活思想的六十多个怎么办》，高兴地说：党叫我们用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切，“怎么办”就是“好向导”，工作起来方便多了。某部副指导员肖贴满在谈学习和运用“怎么办”的经验时说：“今年秋天，我由副连长改行当副指导员，开始很担心不会做政治思想工作，学了‘怎么办’，过去未见过和未处理过的问题也有了办法。六十多个‘怎么办’就像六十多把金钥匙，一用就灵。”
    经过一年来的实践，许多部队最近交流了推广和运用“怎么办”的经验，指战员一致认为，落实“怎么办”就是大立毛泽东思想。他们说：几十个“怎么办”，几百个“怎么办”，一千个“怎么办”，一万个“怎么办”，合起来就是一个怎么用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切，就是用毛泽东思想之“矢”射部队现实思想之“的”。他们指出，开始推广“怎么办”时，有些单位和个人把“怎么办”作为“条例”、“条令”、“教材”去使用，有了问题不等分清性质、特点和原因，就急于去“对号”，生搬硬套，结果效果不大。他们说：“怎么办”方法有千条万条，活学活用毛主席著作是第一条，离开了这一条，“怎么办”就失去了灵魂。某部卫生队体会到：运用“怎么办”的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程。他们在治疗防病工作中，发现有些慢性病号，如：头痛、腰痛、腿痛、肚痛、胸痛的同志，失去治疗信心。这些人光靠药物治疗是不能解决的。他们根据“怎么办”中提出的办法，反复组织这些同志学习“老三篇”和毛主席给王观澜同志的一封信，介绍老一辈如何向疾病作斗争的生动事例，从而使他们树立了正确的人生观和生死观，鼓起了向疾病作斗争的勇气，大大地提高了医疗效果。他们说：“怎么办”是方法，活学活用毛主席著作，使毛泽东思想在人的头脑中扎根是目的，离开了这个目的抓“怎么办”，推广“怎么办”，就会走到邪路上去。
    许多部队在交流经验时，指出：落实“怎么办”的关键在于党委、机关和干部的思想革命化。许多指战员指出，“怎么办”是辩证唯物论的工作方法。党委、机关和干部如果没有深入实际，联系群众，调查研究，做艰苦细致的思想工作的作风，是推广不了、运用不上的。他们从实践中体会到，推广运用“怎么办”的过程，就是改造思想、实现思想革命化的过程。过去有些同志认为：总结“怎么办”需要反复实践，反复研究，确实不容易，但是推广运用“怎么办”就不那么费劲了，照着做就行了。有些同志做思想工作时，把“怎么办”当作教材使用，谁有了思想问题，就简单地把“怎么办”念给谁听，企图不通过做艰苦的工作就想解决问题。大家认为，这是懒汉思想，是形而上学，永远运用不好“怎么办”。怎样才能用“怎么办”，抓好别人的活思想？他们说：首先要抓好自己的活思想。首先自己要革命化。某部指导员陈厚忠在帮助一个后进战士时，按着“怎么办”的精神，首先学习了毛主席关于共产党人对待落后同志的态度的教导，检查了自己对后进战士缺乏深厚的阶级感情，怕做艰苦工作。然后，同这个后进战士一起忆苦思甜，学习“老三篇”，终于使这个战士跨入了先进行列。
    他深深地体会到，运用“怎么办”的过程，就是改造思想的过程，只有不断改造思想，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，为革命事业高度负责的精神，才能真正掌握和运用“怎么办”。
    在总结交流经验时，许多部队还指出：“怎么办”是从群众中、从实践中产生的，推广发展“怎么办”也要依靠群众，依靠实践。大家认为，离开了群众，只是少数几个人在那里忙，推广发展“怎么办”就很困难，就要成为空话。开始有些人对这个问题认识不足，他们以为“怎么办”是交给干部、骨干抓别人活思想的工具，只要干部发动起来就行了，有些人还把推广“怎么办”同群众对立起来。大家指出，群众是亲身实践者，他们最了解自己的活思想，最有知识，最有办法。我们的政治是群众的政治，不相信群众、不依靠群众就什么事也办不好。群众有一定的政治觉悟，他们一旦掌握了正确的思想，就会变成巨大的物质力量。有的指导员介绍了他们的经验教训，开始，他们不敢把“怎么办”交给群众，怕群众掌握了“怎么办”找干部的麻烦，虽说支部开了好几次会，强调要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，大力推广“怎么办”，也组织干部学习过几次，但总是像小脚女人走路一样，迈不开步子。推广了半天，也没有用上几个。后来，按照毛主席的指示和教导，把“怎么办”交给群众讨论，发动大家想办法，共同推广，很快在全连形成了高潮。前后不到一个月，就推广了十五六个“怎么办”，群众不但帮助干部抓好活思想，还利用“怎么办”自己抓自己的活思想。今年来，战士们就先后出了九期活学活用毛主席著作、自己抓自己活思想的“怎么办”墙报专刊，大大地促进了部队思想革命化。
    从大量事实中，大家深刻认识到，推广落实和发展“怎么办”，一定要依靠群众，只要把群众发动起来了，“怎么办”的推广落实，就有了坚实的基础，就能不断地丰富和发展。
