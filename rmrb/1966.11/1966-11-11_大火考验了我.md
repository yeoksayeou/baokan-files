Once, the brigade leader assigned me to patch up the sheep pen. I didn't want to go. I thought: patching up the sheep pen is too heavy a task, why does it have to be me? Although I didn't say it out loud, my heart was really unhappy. During the break, I went to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the exploiters and oppressors of the people and to die for them is lighter than a feather." After reading this, I asked myself: how many times have I resolved to live for the revolution and die for the revolution. Why, today, when the brigade leader assigns me a task that is a bit heavier than others, am I unwilling? The more I thought about it, the more I felt I was wrong. A person can only live for the revolution in order to die for the revolution; to die heavier than Mount Tai, one must, while living, do good deeds for the people at all times, exert oneself for the revolution at all times, and truly cultivate oneself into a person who is wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution, so that when the revolution truly needs one to die, one can bravely sacrifice one's life. Otherwise, saying one is not afraid of death is just empty talk. After that, I strictly used the two standards of "completely" and "thoroughly" to examine and compare myself, and to urge myself on. In addition to actively participating in collective production labor, I also took the time to carry water for the forestry team to water the seedlings, arrange life for the families of revolutionary martyrs and the five guarantees, and wash and mend clothes.

In May, while the performances were going on in Tainan, I bought a ticket and was about to enter the venue. Suddenly, I heard someone shout that there was a fire on Shizi Mountain. I looked south, and there was a huge black smoke, the situation was very urgent. I took a shovel from home and ran up the mountain. When I climbed to the top of the mountain, the flames were getting bigger and bigger. There was no soil to use and no water to extinguish the fire. I saw that there was no other way, so I suggested digging up trees to cut off the fire path. Everyone agreed, and we all started working. In a short while, the fire was reduced. Later, when the wind stopped, we turned back to fight the firehead, and finally, we put out the fire. Among the more than one hundred community members who fought the fire, some had their hair burned, some had their clothes burned in several places, and some had large blisters on their bodies. On the way back, I was so tired that my legs were weak and I had no strength left. My whole body was hurting from the bruises and burns. But thinking that I had acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, I felt especially happy.

    大火考验了我
    山西陵川县汉河公社台南大队妇女主任　王光翠
    有一次，队长派我去垫羊圈，我不愿意去。我想：垫羊圈活太重，为什么偏偏派我去？虽然没说出来，可是心里边实在不痛快。休息时我就去学习《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”读了这段话，我问自己：多少次下过决心，要为革命而生，为革命而死。为什么今天队长派的活比别人重了一些，就不愿意？越想越感到自己不对。一个人只有为革命而生，才能为革命而死；要想死得重于泰山，必须在活着的时候处处为人民办好事，时时为革命出力，把自己真正培养成一心一意为革命的人，才能在革命真正需要自己死的时候，不惜献出自己的生命。不然，再说不怕死也是空话。以后，我就严格用“完全”和“彻底”两把尺子检查对照自己，鞭策自己。平时除积极参加集体生产劳动外，还抽空为林业队担水浇苗，为烈军属、五保户安排生活，洗、补衣服。
    五月间，台南正在演戏，我买好票就要入场。忽然听见有人喊狮子山失了火。我向南一望，好大的黑烟，情况很紧急。我从家里拿了一张铁锨，往山上跑。爬上了山头，火焰越来越大，要土没土，要水没水。我看没办法，就建议刨树断火路，大家同意了，就一起动手，一会儿，火势减小了。后来风停下来，我们就扭回头来打火头，最后，终于把火扑灭了。我们救火的一百多名社员，有的头发被火烧了，有的衣服烧了好几片，有的身上烧起了大泡。回来的路上，我累的两腿发软，一点力气都没有了，浑身的挂伤、烧伤都疼起来。可是，想到自己按照毛主席的教导办了事，觉得特别愉快。
