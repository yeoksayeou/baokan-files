The People's Liberation Army, stationed at the forefront of the Yellow Sea, is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying forward the spirit of Yan'an, and engaging in extensive agricultural and sideline production on the island. They have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat, breaking away from the situation of relying on mainland supplies for more than a decade. Through labor, the ideological transformation of the troops has been accelerated, making this unit a great school of Mao Zedong Thought on the island.

This unit has a heavy combat readiness mission, and some people think that production is not important. In response to this active thought, the Party committee organized the troops to study Chairman Mao's works such as "Organize" and "On the Army's Self-Sufficiency in Production, and the Importance of the Two Movements of Rectification and Production." This unified the thoughts of the cadres and soldiers, and a mass movement of agricultural and sideline production swept through the unit.

The soldiers stationed on the top of a high cliff far from residential areas, while performing their observation duties, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They moved stones and soil to create fields. On this three hundred square meter high mountain top, where few people have ever set foot, they created sixty-six plots of land, including pot-lid fields and table-top fields, growing vegetables such as pumpkins, cabbages, and radishes, and raising pigs, sheep, chickens, and other livestock. They achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat.

The platoons living on the high mountains took this observation post as an example and fought against nature. The Anti-Aircraft Artillery Second Platoon moved the stones on their station one by one, bringing up the soil from below and bringing in soil from other places to fill it up. The supply officer, Cheng Boshan, worked during the day and dug stones to create fields at night, often working until late at night. His hands were calloused, and his arms were swollen, but he did not care. After two months of hard work, he dug out more than twenty cubic meters of stones and improved more than twenty square meters of land. Inspired by him, the entire platoon dug out nearly a hundred stone plots and improved seventy-plus terraced fields. Without fertilizer, the cadres and soldiers picked and gathered it. Without water, the cadres and soldiers carried it up from the mountain in buckets and basins, and in baskets, digging wells on the mountain with picks and hammers.

The platoons living at the foot of the mountain also fought against nature with a heroic spirit of changing the world. The Third Guard Platoon had a piece of saline-alkali land near their station. The cadres and soldiers worked early and late, carrying soil and mixing it with ash, leveling the land, and building drainage ditches, finally turning the saline-alkali land into fertile fields.

The staff, soldiers, and family members of the unit used their spare time to move thousands of cubic meters of soil on two hills, dig two deep wells, and transform fifteen mu of garden fields that are resistant to drought and waterlogging, with stable and high yields. They produced more than three million jin of vegetables annually, which not only met their own needs but also supported other units. The action of the headquarters not only inspired the troops but also pointed out the direction for the vegetable production of the troops.

Since last year, this unit has achieved full self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat. This not only improved the living conditions of the troops, strengthened the troops' physical fitness, reduced the state's burden, saved a large amount of manpower and transportation, and directly supported the country's socialist construction. More importantly, through labor, the spiritual outlook of the cadres, soldiers, and family members of the unit was changed, and the ideological transformation of the troops was accelerated.

	The soldiers of the "Red Flag Outpost" never forget to study Chairman Mao's works. This is a scene of soldiers studying the article "On the Army's Self-Sufficiency in Production, and the Importance of the Two Movements of Rectification and Production."

    人民解放军既是战斗队、工作队，又是生产队
    某守岛部队蔬菜肉食全部自给
    本报讯　驻守祖国黄海前哨的人民解放军某守岛部队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬南泥湾精神，在岛上大搞农副业生产，达到了蔬菜和肉食自给，摆脱了十多年来依赖内地供应副食品的局面。通过生产劳动，还加速了部队的思想革命化，使这个部队成了岛上的一座毛泽东思想的大学校。
    这个部队战备任务十分繁重，有人认为生产搞不搞不要紧。针对这种活思想，党委组织部队学习了毛主席的《组织起来》、《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》等文章，使干部战士认识到：我们军队既是战斗队、工作队，又是生产队。思想统一以后，部队里掀起了群众性的农副业生产热潮。
    住在远离居民点的高山悬崖顶上的某观察站的战士们，在执行观察任务的同时，按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，搬石移土造田。在这个自古人迹罕到的三百平方米的高山顶上，开出了锅盖田、桌面田共六十六块，种出了南瓜、白菜、萝卜等瓜菜，喂了猪、羊、鸡等家畜家禽，实现了蔬菜和肉食自给。
    住在高山上的连队，都以这个观察站为榜样，战天斗地。高炮二连把驻地的山石一块一块地撬开，把下面的土翻上来，把别处的土搬过来垫上。司务长程伯山，白天工作忙，晚上刨石造田，经常干到深夜，手磨破了，臂震肿了，他也不顾。奋战两个月，刨出了二十多立方米的石头，整修出二十多平方米的一块山地。在他的带动下，全连同志刨出了近百块石头地，整修成七十多块梯田。没有肥料，干部战士去拾去拣。没有水，干部战士从山下一瓢瓢、一盆盆端，一担担挑，在山上一镐一锤地穿石凿井。
    住在山下的连队，也以改天换地的英雄气概向大自然开战。守备三连驻地附近有一片盐碱地，干部、战士起早贪黑，抬土掺灰，平整土地，修排水渠，终于把盐碱地改造成了良田。
    机关干部、战士和随军家属利用业余时间，在两个土岗上，抬土几千立方米，打深井两眼，改造出旱涝保收、稳产高产的园田化菜地十五亩，每年产菜三十多万斤，除自给外，还支援了其他单位。机关的这一行动，不仅鼓舞了部队，而且给部队的蔬菜生产指出了努力方向。
    这个部队从去年起就实现了蔬菜和肉食的全部自给。这不仅改善了部队生活，增强了部队体质，减轻了国家负担，节约了大量人力和车船运输力，直接支援了国家社会主义建设，更重要的是通过生产劳动，改变了干部战士和随军家属的精神面貌，加速了部队的思想革命化。

    “红旗哨所”的战士时刻不忘学习毛主席著作。这是战士们正在学习《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》的文章。
