The Khmer people are particularly delighted with the new achievements of the People's Republic of China and regard them as a valuable contribution to the cause of peace, greatly inspiring the peoples of all countries who, like the People's Republic of China and Cambodia, are resolutely resisting imperialist threats. Therefore, upon learning that the friendly Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, have made rapid and tremendous progress in the nuclear field, we are genuinely happy. With a spirit of unity and shared joy, I extend my highest regards to you."

The telegram further stated that the great victory achieved by the Chinese people proves that imperialism, especially American imperialism, is weak and will inevitably suffer an unavoidable defeat.
