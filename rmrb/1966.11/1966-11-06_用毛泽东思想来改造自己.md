Chairman Mao is the greatest figure in human history. Chairman Mao has completely forgotten himself and always thinks of the people. Therefore, I believe Chairman Mao is the greatest. I admire Chairman Mao the most. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works diligently, arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, and transform myself.

    用毛泽东思想来改造自己
    毛主席是人类有史以来最伟大的人物。毛主席完全忘掉了自己，处处想的是人民。因此我认为毛主席是最伟大的。我最敬仰毛主席。今后我一定要好好学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己，改造自己。　日本　横江浩
