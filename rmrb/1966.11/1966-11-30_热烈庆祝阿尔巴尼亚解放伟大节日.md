Ambassador Natanieli and Premier Zhou speak, expressing that the peoples of China and Albania will forever hold high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism together, and carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th: Albanian Ambassador to China, Vasili Natanieli, hosted a grand reception tonight to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Albanian liberation.

Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, He Long, Li Xiannian, Liu Ningyi, Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, and others were invited to attend the reception.

At the reception, Ambassador Natanieli and Premier Zhou Enlai both delivered speeches, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary unity and fighting friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. They expressed that the peoples of China and Albania will forever hold high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism together, and carry the struggle against American imperialism and modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party to the end.

In his speech, Premier Zhou, on behalf of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, warmly congratulated the great day of the 22nd anniversary of Albanian liberation; warmly congratulated the great achievements of the Albanian people in socialist revolution and socialist construction; and warmly congratulated the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor.

The delegation led by Petrit Dodo of the Albania-China Friendship Association, and the delegation led by Kico Ngjela of the Albanian Government Trade Mission, attended the reception.

Ambassador Natanieli first spoke at the reception. He introduced how, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor, the Albanian people, with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun, have built socialism victoriously over the past 22 years, transforming Albania from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural and industrial country.

The ambassador said that the 22-year journey is also a path of struggle for the Albanian people against American imperialism, Tito revisionism, and Khrushchev revisionism. These enemies engaged in vile activities and interference, attempting to make Albania deviate from the revolution, socialism, national independence, and take the path of betraying the revolution and restoring capitalism. However, the Albanian Party of Labor will not make any concessions to them and has fought resolutely against them. Relying on their own strength and the internationalist aid of the brotherly Chinese people, they have foiled all their blockades and pressures, causing their plots to fail.

The ambassador said that the resolutions and directives of our party's Fifth Congress and the fourth five-year plan for developing the national economy and culture have shown a bright future for our country. Albania will march forward vigorously on the path of building a comprehensive socialist society. The cultural and ideological revolution will be rapidly and deeply carried out in all fields to stop the manifestations of bourgeois and revisionist ideology and ensure the path to communism.

Ambassador Natanieli said that currently, imperialists led by the United States and modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership are colluding to oppose the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries, attempting to dominate the world by dividing spheres of influence. The Albanian government believes that a resolute attitude must be taken against these enemies of humanity, and an uncompromising struggle must be waged to thoroughly smash all their plots and tricks.

The ambassador said that the People's Republic of China stands at the forefront of this struggle. On all issues, the views of our two governments are completely consistent. The joint statement signed by the party and government delegations of the two countries in Beijing in May this year is our common program of action for seeking socialism and opposing imperialism and revisionism, and is a document of historical significance to all revolutionary parties and peoples of the world.

The ambassador said that the People's Republic of China and the glorious Communist Party of China led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong are steadfast flag bearers of the revolutionary cause and the defense of the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries, an invincible giant, and an insurmountable fortress against the plans of American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism to dominate the world. He pointed out that every country and people who love freedom, defending the People's Republic of China from the slander and defamation of American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, is defending their own interests; all those who oppose the People's Republic of China are opposing the interests of their own people and all of humanity. Those who oppose the People's Republic of China will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

The ambassador said that the Albanian government fully supports the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against American aggression for national liberation. We will steadfastly support the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Ambassador Natanieli said that the relationship between the two countries of Albania and China has developed comprehensively, and this relationship has become a shining example of the relationship between socialist countries. The relationship between our two countries, built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, has not only become an important factor in defending the revolutionary achievements and building socialism in our two countries, but also a strong pillar for all progressive and revolutionary peoples in the world who dare to oppose imperialism and its lackeys.

The ambassador praised that under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party and the outstanding leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved extremely great achievements in all aspects. The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution underway in China has made the Chinese people stand up with a revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit that makes all enemies—imperialists and modern revisionists—tremble. Our people welcome this major event and believe that the Chinese people, implementing the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao, will certainly achieve even greater victories on the path of socialism and communism.

Premier Zhou, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the brilliant victories of the Albanian people in revolutionary struggle and socialist construction under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor. He said that over the past year, the Albanian Party of Labor and government have taken a series of revolutionary measures to prevent capitalist restoration, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, greatly raise the political and ideological consciousness of the masses, and powerfully promote the rapid development of socialist construction.

Premier Zhou pointed out that the recently concluded Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor is a congress of great significance in the history of Albanian socialist revolution and socialist construction, and a congress of international significance in opposing imperialism and modern revisionism. This congress has raised high the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism, emphasized proletarian politics, stressed class struggle in socialist society, and called for further development of the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields. The political tasks proposed by the congress and the fourth five-year plan it has formulated will certainly push Albanian socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new height, making Albania an even more prosperous and powerful socialist country.

Premier Zhou said that the Albanian Party of Labor, government, and people have always raised the banner of opposing imperialism, resolutely opposed the war and aggression policies of American imperialism, resolutely supported the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, and resolutely supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries. This has played an important role in promoting the world revolutionary cause and maintaining world peace.

Premier Zhou said that the Albanian Party of Labor, government, and people have always raised the banner of opposing modern revisionism, and have waged a heroic struggle against the Soviet Communist Party leadership and its followers, as well as the traitorous Tito clique. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Soviet revisionist leadership, the Yugoslav Tito clique, all kinds of traitors and scabs, compared to you, they are nothing but a handful of earth, while you are mountains that touch the sky."

Premier Zhou said that the Albanian Party of Labor, government, and people have always dared to struggle and dared to win. They dare to revolutionize themselves and also dare to support others in their revolution. The Albanian Party of Labor has made outstanding contributions to promoting the international communist movement and defending and developing Marxism-Leninism in its long history of revolutionary struggle and resolute support for the revolutionary activities of all true Marxist-Leninists. Heroic Albania has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe and a red base supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

Premier Zhou said that currently, the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution underway in our country is a great revolution that touches people's souls and breaks the old to establish the new. It is deeper and more surging than any of China's previous great revolutionary mass movements. It is a higher stage of proletarian revolutionary movement.

He said that our country's proletarian cultural revolution has already achieved brilliant results. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong has won, and the bourgeois anti-revolutionary line has been declared a failure. Now, the country is entering a new high tide of thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and further eliminating the influence of this erroneous line. We must firmly establish the proletarian mass line of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' spirit of initiative, letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. We must follow the instructions of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao: "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, be among the masses, and make the proletarian cultural revolution better."

Premier Zhou said that our two parties, two countries, and two peoples have, through long-term joint struggles, forged a deep friendship and fighting unity. Regarding this friendship and unity, Chairman Mao's telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor gave the most vivid and correct description and evaluation. Chairman Mao said: "'Within the seas, there are friends; at the ends of the earth, it is like being neighbors.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We and you are not those false friends with honeyed words and daggers in their hearts, not those two-faced people. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests." Comrade Mao Zedong's telegram and Comrade Enver Hoxha's recent high evaluation of Sino-Albanian friendship have pushed the friendship and unity of our two parties, two countries, and two peoples to a higher stage.

Premier Zhou finally said, "We are deeply convinced that no matter what happens in the world in the future, our two parties, two countries, and two peoples will definitely remain united, fight together, and win together. Let us jointly hold high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, unite with all anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist people in the world, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations, and carry the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys through to the end; unite with all Marxist-Leninists in the world, and carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership through to the end; and push the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the peoples of the world to a new high tide."

The speeches of Ambassador Natanieli and Premier Zhou sparked wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Those invited to attend the reception also included Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang and Xu Dehua, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Xiao, heads of various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the government, heads of the People's Liberation Army, various people's organizations, and heads of Beijing Municipality.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception. (With photos)

    纳塔奈利大使举行盛大招待会
    热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放伟大节日
    周恩来、陶铸、康生、李富春、陈毅等同志到会祝贺
    纳塔奈利大使和周总理讲话表示，中阿两国人民将永远共同高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，把反帝反修斗争进行到底。
    新华社二十九日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利今晚举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十二周年。
    党和国家领导人周恩来、陶铸、康生、李富春、陈毅、贺龙、李先念、刘宁一、郭沫若、杨明轩等，应邀出席了招待会。
    在招待会上纳塔奈利大使和周恩来总理先后发表讲话，热情颂扬中阿两党、两国、两国人民建筑在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的革命团结和战斗友谊。他们表示，中阿两国人民将永远共同高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，把反对美帝国主义和反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    周总理在讲话中代表毛主席，代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚解放二十二周年的伟大节日；热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就；热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的圆满成功。
    由彼·多德率领的阿中友协代表团，由基乔·恩杰拉率领的阿尔巴尼亚政府贸易代表团，出席了招待会。
    纳塔奈利大使在招待会上首先讲话。他介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民二十二年来在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，胜利地建设社会主义，使阿尔巴尼亚由一个落后的农业国变为农业工业国。
    大使说，二十二年的路程也是阿尔巴尼亚人民反对美帝国主义、铁托修正主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的战斗路程。这些敌人进行卑劣活动和干涉，妄图使阿尔巴尼亚离开革命，离开社会主义，离开民族独立，走上叛卖革命和恢复资本主义的道路。但是，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党决不向他们作任何让步，并同他们作了坚决的斗争。我国人民依靠自己的力量和兄弟中国人民的国际主义援助，粉碎了他们的一切封锁和压力，使他们的阴谋遭到了破产。
    大使说，我们党的五大的决议和所通过的发展国民经济和文化的第四个五年计划的指示，为我国展示了光辉的前景。阿尔巴尼亚在全面建设社会主义社会的道路上，将昂首阔步地前进。文化和思想革命将在各个领域里迅速地深入开展，以制止资产阶级和修正主义的思想的表现，保证走向共产主义。
    纳塔奈利大使说，目前，以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者勾结在一起，反对各国人民的自由和独立，通过划分势力范围来主宰世界。阿尔巴尼亚政府认为，对于这些人类的敌人，必须采取坚决的态度，必须进行毫不妥协的斗争，以彻底粉碎它们的一切阴谋诡计。
    大使说，中华人民共和国站在这场斗争的最前头，在所有问题上，我们两国政府的观点都完全一致。今年五月，我们两国党政代表团在北京签署的联合声明，是我们争取社会主义、反对帝国主义和修正主义的共同行动纲领，是对世界所有革命党和革命人民具有历史意义的文献。
    大使说，中华人民共和国和以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党，是革命事业和保卫各国人民自由和独立的坚定旗手，是一个强大的不可战胜的巨人，是美帝国主义和修正主义主宰世界计划所不可逾越的堡垒。他指出，每个国家和热爱自由的人民，维护中华人民共和国不受美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义这些敌人的诽谤和中伤，就是维护本国的利益；所有那些反对中华人民共和国的人，就是反对他们本国人民和全人类的利益。反对中华人民共和国的人必将遭到可耻的失败。
    大使说，阿尔巴尼亚政府完全支持英雄的兄弟的越南人民的反美救国的正义斗争。我们将坚持不渝地支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    纳塔奈利大使说，阿中两国的关系得到了全面的发展，这种关系已成为社会主义国家关系的光辉榜样。我们两国建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的关系，不仅已经成为保卫我们两国革命胜利果实和建设社会主义的重要因素，而且是世界上一切敢于反对帝国主义及其奴仆的进步人民和革命人民的坚强支柱。
    大使赞扬说，中国人民在光荣的共产党和杰出的领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在各个方面取得了极其伟大的成就。中国正在开展的气势空前的无产阶级文化大革命，已使中国人民树起了使一切敌人——帝国主义者和现代修正主义者胆战心惊的革命精神和战斗精神。我国人民欢迎这一重大事件，并且相信，兄弟中国人民贯彻毛泽东主席的光辉思想，一定能够在社会主义和共产主义的道路上取得更为伟大的胜利。
    周总理在讲话中热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，在革命斗争和社会主义建设中取得了辉煌胜利。他说，最近一年来，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府采取了一系列防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政的革命化措施，大大提高了人民群众的政治思想觉悟，有力地推动了社会主义建设事业的迅速发展。
    周总理指出，刚刚胜利闭幕的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，是在阿尔巴尼亚社会主义革命和社会主义建设历史上具有重大意义的大会，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的具有国际意义的大会。这次大会高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，强调社会主义社会的阶级斗争，号召进一步开展思想文化领域的社会主义革命。大会提出的政治任务和制订的第四个五年计划，必将把阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向一个新的高峰，使阿尔巴尼亚成为更加繁荣强盛的社会主义国家。
    周总理说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和人民一贯高举反对帝国主义的旗帜，坚决反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和各国人民的革命斗争，对于推进世界革命事业、维护世界和平起了重要的作用。
    周总理说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和人民一贯高举反对现代修正主义的旗帜，同苏共领导集团及其追随者，同叛徒铁托集团，进行了英勇的斗争。正如毛泽东同志所说：“苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。”
    周总理说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和人民一贯敢于斗争，敢于胜利。自己敢革命，也敢于支持别人革命。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在长期的革命斗争中，在坚决支持一切真正的马克思列宁主义者的革命活动中，对于促进国际共产主义运动，对于捍卫和发展马克思列宁主义，作出了卓越的贡献。英雄人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯，成为支援世界人民革命斗争的一个红色根据地。
    周总理说，目前，我国正在开展的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场破四旧立四新、触及人们灵魂的大革命。它比中国历来几次的大革命群众运动，都更深刻、更汹涌澎湃。这是更高阶段的无产阶级革命运动。
    他说，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了辉煌的战果。以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了胜利，资产阶级反对革命的路线已经宣告失败。现在全国正进入一个彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的新高潮，进一步肃清这个错误路线的影响。我们一定要牢固地树立起相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的无产阶级群众路线的思想和作风。我们一定要按照我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的指示：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    周总理说，我们两党、两国和两国人民在长期的共同斗争中，结成了深厚的友谊和战斗的团结。对于这种友谊和团结，毛泽东主席给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电作了最生动、最正确的描述和估价。毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”毛泽东同志的贺电和恩维尔·霍查同志最近对中阿友谊的高度评价，把我们两党、两国和两国人民的友谊和团结推进到一个更高的阶段。
    周总理最后说，我们深信，今后不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国、两国人民一定永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。让我们共同高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，联合世界上一切反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的人们，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的革命斗争，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底；联合世界上一切马克思列宁主义者，把反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底；把国际无产阶级和世界人民的革命事业推向新的高潮。
    纳塔奈利大使和周总理的讲话，在全场激起了一阵又一阵热烈的掌声。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有政协全国委员会副主席李四光、许德珩，国防委员会副主席傅作义，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，外交部副部长刘晓，中共中央和政府各部门的负责人，中国人民解放军、各人民团体以及北京市的负责人。
