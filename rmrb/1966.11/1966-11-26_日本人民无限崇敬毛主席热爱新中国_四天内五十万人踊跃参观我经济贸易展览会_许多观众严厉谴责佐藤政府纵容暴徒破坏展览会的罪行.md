Over the past four days, 500,000 people have enthusiastically visited the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition. Many viewers have strongly condemned the Sato government's tolerance of thugs who disrupted the exhibition.

NAGOYA, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) — Just as the Japanese Sato government repeatedly allowed right-wing groups to disrupt the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition in Nagoya, the broad masses of the Japanese people, filled with infinite respect for Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, and with admiration for the achievements of Chinese socialist construction, and with the desire to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, have been visiting the Chinese exhibition in droves.

In recent days, the temperature in Nagoya has suddenly dropped, but the road leading to the Chinese exhibition hall has been crowded with visitors from morning to night. By noon on the 24th, just four days after the exhibition opened, the number of visitors had already exceeded 500,000. This scene shows the broad masses of the Japanese people's enthusiastic welcome and support for the Chinese exhibition, and is a heavy blow to the Sato government, which is hostile to China, and to all kinds of elements that disrupt Sino-Japanese friendship.

Japanese friends from Tokyo, Osaka, and the Hokuriku region, who happened to be visiting at the time when the Sato government allowed right-wing groups to cause trouble, spontaneously joined the struggle to defend the exhibition. After the thugs fled, they visited the exhibition. One Japanese friend said after visiting the exhibition, "From the exhibition, I saw the great efforts the Chinese people have made for Sino-Japanese friendship."

On the 23rd, more than 60 blind people from Kyoto came to visit the exhibition. They stroked the machines on display over and over again with their hands and listened attentively to the explanations of the guides. A blind female masseuse said, "I visited a Chinese exhibition in Osaka two years ago. Although I can't see with my eyes, I feel from the sounds I hear that the Chinese people are united and advancing at a rapid pace." These blind visitors shouted "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship" as they left the venue.

Since the serious incident of the Sato government allowing Japanese thugs to disrupt the exhibition and police to unreasonably beat Chinese exhibition team members on the 22nd, many visitors and friends have been writing letters, making phone calls, or coming to the exhibition venue to express their condolences and support. A young student who visited the exhibition on the 21st braved the cold to return to the exhibition on the 23rd and told the Chinese staff, "The Japanese people are all on your side. The cause of Sino-Japanese friendship is just and cannot be destroyed by anyone."

On the 24th, Socialist Party member Suikei Shiro told Chinese reporters at the exhibition venue that the incident of disrupting the Chinese exhibition on the 22nd, under the tolerance of the Sato government, was a serious step taken by the Sato government to follow American imperialism, revive militarism, and be hostile to China. Suikei said that the people of Aichi Prefecture, like all the people of Japan, strongly condemn the atrocities of the Japanese authorities. He said that the deep affection between the peoples of China and Japan will be further consolidated and developed through this exhibition. He said that a small handful of saboteurs will absolutely not be able to stop the tide of Sino-Japanese friendship.

    日本人民无限崇敬毛主席热爱新中国
    四天内五十万人踊跃参观我经济贸易展览会
    许多观众严厉谴责佐藤政府纵容暴徒破坏展览会的罪行
    新华社二十五日讯　名古屋消息：正当日本佐藤政府一再纵容右翼团体破坏在名古屋举行的中国经济贸易展览会的时候，日本广大人民满怀对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限崇敬，对中国社会主义建设成就无限敬佩的心情和增进日中两国人民友好的愿望，连日来踊跃参观中国展览会。
    名古屋市最近几天气温骤然下降，但是在通往中国展览馆的大路上，从早到晚观众络绎不绝。到二十四日中午，即在展览会开幕后的仅仅四天内，观众就已经超过了五十万人。这一盛况，表明了广大日本人民对中国展览会的热烈欢迎和支持，也是对敌视中国的佐藤政府和形形色色的破坏日中友好的分子的沉重打击。
    来自东京、大阪和北信越参观团的日本朋友，正赶上佐藤政府纵容右翼团体进行捣乱，许多朋友自动地参加了保卫展览会的英勇斗争。他们在暴徒溜走后参观了展览会。其中一位日本朋友看完了展览会后感动地说：“从展览会上，我看到了中国人民为了日中友好做出的巨大的努力。”
    二十三日，京都六十多名盲人到展览会来参观。他们用手一遍又一遍地抚摸着展出的机器，用心地倾听讲解员的介绍。一位双目失明的女按摩师说，我前年曾在大阪参观过中国的展览会。尽管我不能用眼睛看，可是我从听到的声音里感到中国人民团结一致，正以飞速的步伐前进着。这些盲人观众在参观完毕离开会场时，高呼“日中友好万岁”的口号。
    自从二十二日佐藤政府纵容日本暴徒破坏展览会和警察无理殴打中国展览团人员的严重事件发生后，连日来很多观众和朋友纷纷写信、打电话，或者亲自来展览会场，向中国展览团和日本协力会，表示慰问和支持。一位在二十一日来参观过展览会的青年学生，二十三日冒着寒风再次来到展览会，向中国人员说，日本人民都站在你们一边，日中友好的事业是正义的，是谁也破坏不了的。
    社会党议员穗积七郎二十四日在展览会场对中国记者说，二十二日在佐藤政府纵容下发生的破坏中国展览会的事件，是佐藤政府追随美帝国主义，复活军国主义和敌视中国的严重步骤。穗积说，爱知县人民和全日本人民一样，严厉谴责日本当局的暴行。他表示，日中两国人民的深情厚谊，将会通过这次展览会，进一步得到巩固和发展。他说，一小撮破坏分子，绝对阻止不了日中友好的潮流的发展。
