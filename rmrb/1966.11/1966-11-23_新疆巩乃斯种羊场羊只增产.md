The Xinjiang Gansu Sheep Farm, a breeding base for fine-wool sheep in Xinjiang, has seen an increase in sheep production this year. The total reproduction rate of fine-wool sheep reached 43%, with a significant increase in the average survival rate of offspring. Notably, the number of first-grade rams has increased by 15% compared to last year.

The superior breeds of fine-wool sheep successfully cultivated by this farm have been promoted nationwide.

This year, the revolutionary workers of this farm have further elevated their spirit of herding for the revolution by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have overcome numerous difficulties to achieve increased sheep production. (Photo attached)
