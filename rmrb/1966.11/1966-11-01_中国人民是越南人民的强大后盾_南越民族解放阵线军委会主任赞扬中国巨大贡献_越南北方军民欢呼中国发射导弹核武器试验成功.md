The Chinese people are a powerful backing for the Vietnamese people. The Chairman of the Military Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam praises China's great contributions. The military and civilians in North Vietnam cheer for China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test.

BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Lin Biao received a telegram from Nguyen Van Thieu, Chairman of the Central Military Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, congratulating China on the successful test of its missile and nuclear weapons. The telegram reads:

"On the occasion of China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons, I, on behalf of the entire cadre and soldiers of the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, extend our warmest congratulations to you and all the cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Vietnamese people and the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam regard this great achievement of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people as a tremendous encouragement for our struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation. It is a great contribution to the struggle of the people of Asia and the world against imperialism and colonialism led by American imperialism, for independence and peace.

We wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, greater achievements in the development of science and technology and the strengthening of national defense to safeguard national security, and greater contributions to the world revolution and the cause of peace."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, Oct. 30 -- The news of China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons has greatly encouraged the Vietnamese military and civilians fighting on the front lines against the Americans. They cheer for the great victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The Vietnamese military and civilians say: This great victory of the Chinese people is also a victory for the Vietnamese people. With an increasingly powerful Chinese rear, we will definitely defeat the American aggressors.

The soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit defending the heroic capital of Hanoi were in high spirits when they heard the news on the radio at dawn on the 28th and immediately expressed their warm congratulations to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.

The broad masses of civilian self-defense forces in Hanoi were also excited when they heard the news and spread it around. A cadre from the south, self-defense platoon leader Ho Xuan Khanh, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! This once again proves the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao. We have unlimited respect and trust in Mao Zedong Thought." Platoon leader Nguyen Thanh The said: "The great victory of China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons is a heavy blow to American imperialism and modern revisionism, completely foiling their plot to monopolize nuclear weapons."

The news spread throughout the factories and enterprises in Hanoi, bringing great joy and encouragement to the workers who are bravely fighting while producing. Worker Phan Van Luong of the Hanoi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant said excitedly: "The great victory of the Chinese people is also our victory. This victory has further strengthened our confidence and strength to defeat the American aggressors!" Secretary of the trade union of the Hanoi Noodle Factory, Nguyen Van Hau, also said excitedly: "China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people and all the people of the world. We will resolutely carry out Chairman Hu's battle call, fight to the end, and thoroughly drive out the American aggressors to achieve final victory."
