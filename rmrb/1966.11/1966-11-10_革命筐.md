At an exhibition held by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, there was a bamboo basket used by the model soldier and exemplary Young Communist League member Liu Ruiming, which had been repaired over forty times. Liu Ruiming used this bamboo basket to participate in the construction of the Niu Tian Yang Great Sea Dike, carrying over ten thousand loads of sea mud. The audience exclaimed in admiration: "This is not an ordinary basket, this is a revolutionary basket!"

Yes, this is a revolutionary basket. Every single strip of bamboo in it records a step in Liu Ruiming's journey forward.

In September 1962, the battle cry for reclaiming land from the sea was sounded. During the day, Liu Ruiming listened to the political instructor's pre-battle mobilization speech. At night, he opened Chairman Mao's works and read the article "On the Army's Self-Sufficiency in Production and the Importance of the Two Movements of Rectification and Production" repeatedly. He wrote in his notebook: "I must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle, and with redoubled enthusiasm and boundless energy, throw myself into the battle of reclaiming land from the sea. I am determined to temper myself into a revolutionary successor of the proletariat in the course of labor..."

The next day, the battle to build the Niu Tian Yang Sea Dike began. Liu Ruiming put Chairman Mao's works in his chest pocket, carrying a brand-new bamboo basket, and was the first to arrive at the construction site. Building the dike was indeed a test for Liu Ruiming, who had just entered the army from school. However, Chairman Mao's works gave him boundless strength. He said: "After reading Chairman Mao's books, I feel that the burden on my shoulders is not an ordinary one, but the burden of the world revolution. No matter how hard or tired, I must endure it!" In the first week after starting work, he was evaluated as the labor model of the company.

Building the great sea dike requires a large amount of sea mud. The bamboo basket thus became the most important transportation tool. However, sea mud is both wet and heavy, and a new basket would break after five or six days of use. The upper levels' allocation of bamboo baskets could not be supplied in time, and the progress of the project was about to be affected.

At night, Liu Ruiming, as usual, studied Chairman Mao's works under his small kerosene lamp. Chairman Mao said: "... Our six hundred million people must all practice increased production and economy, and oppose extravagance and waste. This is not only of great significance in the economy but also of great significance in politics." These words illuminated Liu Ruiming's heart. That's right! Repairing a bamboo basket is not just to save a few cents, but more importantly, to make us always think of the interests of six hundred million people and cultivate the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle. The next day after work, he borrowed a hatchet from the kitchen, cut a few wild bamboo sticks, and planned to split them into strips. However, his technique was not proficient, and the bamboo was split unevenly, thick in some places and thin in others, and it would break when it hit a node. Just at this moment, the political instructor came over, praised Liu Ruiming's actions, and encouraged him, telling him not to be afraid of difficulties. If there are difficulties, consult Chairman Mao's works!

Deep into the night, Liu Ruiming was still studying Chairman Mao's works under the small oil lamp. Chairman Mao's words gave him boundless energy and confidence. He made up his mind to overcome any difficulty, no matter how great!

The next day, he found out that there was a bamboo workshop in a nearby town, so he eagerly went there and stood by to watch the master split the bamboo. After watching for a while, he felt he had some idea. However, when he returned to the barracks and picked up the knife, none of the original problems were solved. He went to the bamboo workshop again to seek advice. The master was very surprised and asked: "Young comrade, you are not making baskets or weaving baskets, why ask this?" Liu Ruiming explained the reason, and the master praised him: "The soldiers trained by Chairman Mao are the best! The best!" and enthusiastically taught him the techniques, even demonstrating how to split the bamboo. After learning to split the bamboo, he encountered a new obstacle: when weaving the basket, the bamboo strips would break at the turns. He went to seek advice for the third time and finally mastered the technique of twisting the bamboo strips.

From then on, he went out early and returned late every day. Before work, he would cut wild bamboo sticks, split them into strips, and bring them to the construction site. During the rest time, as soon as the whistle blew, he would drag the bamboo strips and a pair of scissors from one team to another, repairing broken baskets wherever he saw them. Sometimes he couldn't finish repairing them on the construction site, so he would bring the broken baskets back and repair them until deep into the night. Every broken basket was reborn in Liu Ruiming's hands.

Liu Ruiming's own bamboo basket was repaired and broken, broken and repaired, over forty times. In one labor competition, he broke the basket frame. Some comrades joked with him: "This basket of yours should be 'retired' this time, right?" He replied loudly: "No! I will let it continue to 'serve'!" After work, he cut two wild bamboo sticks and repaired it again. The basket frame was broken, so it had to be rewoven. Once, twice, three times... dismantled and woven, woven and dismantled, until the sixth time, he finally succeeded. He looked at the newly restored bamboo basket and smiled happily.

The next morning, the comrades saw that Liu Ruiming's basket, which was broken beyond recognition, had become a sturdy new basket again. Everyone exclaimed: "Every strip of bamboo on Liu Ruiming's basket shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought! Every strip of bamboo weaves his boundless loyalty to the revolution and to the people!"

    革命筐
    章长　方克
    在人民解放军某部举办的展览会上，有五好战士、模范共青团员刘瑞明同志用过的一担补过四十多次的竹筐。刘瑞明同志就是用这担竹筐，参加了修筑牛田洋大海堤的战斗，挑了上万担海泥。观众纷纷赞叹说：“这不是一担普通的竹筐，这是一担革命筐！”
    对！这是一担革命筐。它的每一条篾，都是刘瑞明同志前进道路上的一次记录。
    一九六二年的九月，围海造田的战斗号角吹响了。白天，刘瑞明听了指导员的“战前动员”。晚上，他打开毛主席著作，把《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》一文，反复地读了几遍。他在笔记本上写下了自己的决心：“我一定牢记毛主席的教导，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统，以百倍的热情和冲天的干劲投入围海造田的战斗，并决心在劳动中把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命接班人。……”
    第二天，修筑牛田洋海堤的战斗开始了。刘瑞明把毛主席著作揣在怀里，挑着崭新的竹筐第一个来到了工地。筑堤劳动，对于刚从学校入伍的刘瑞明来说，确实是个考验。但是，毛主席著作给了他无比的力量。他说：“读了毛主席的书，就觉得肩上挑的不是普通的担子，而是世界革命的重担，再苦再累，也要顶得住！”开工后的第一周，他就被评为连里的劳动标兵。
    修筑大海堤需要大量的海泥。竹筐就成了最重要的运输工具。但是海泥又湿又重，一担新筐用了五、六天就破了。上级拨的竹筐一时供应不上，眼看工程进度就要受到影响。
    晚上，刘瑞明跟往常一样，在自己制的小煤油灯下学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“……我们六亿人口都要实行增产节约，反对铺张浪费。这不但在经济上有重大意义，在政治上也有重大意义。”这几句话照亮了刘瑞明的心，对呀！补一担竹筐，不光是为了节约几角钱，更重要的是使我们时刻想到六亿人民的利益，培养艰苦奋斗的革命精神。第二天收工，他吃完晚饭，就从伙房借了把柴刀，砍了几根野竹子，准备把它破成篾条。可是，技术不熟练，竹子破得粗一段，细一段，遇到竹节就干脆断了。正在这时候，指导员赶来了，赞扬了刘瑞明的做法，并鼓励他，不要怕困难。有困难就向毛主席著作请教！
    夜深了，刘瑞明还在小油灯下认真向毛主席著作请教。毛主席的话，使他浑身是劲，信心百倍。他下定决心，那怕有天大困难也要战胜它！
    第二天，他打听到附近小镇上有个竹器坊，便兴冲冲地去了，站在一旁看老师傅破篾。看了会儿，觉得有些门道了。可是回到营房一拿起刀来，原来的难题一个也没有解决。他又去竹器坊请教。老师傅觉得很奇怪，问道：“小同志，你又不编筐织篓的，问这个干什么？”刘瑞明说明了来由，老师傅满口夸奖：“毛主席教出来的解放军顶呱呱！顶呱呱！”并热情地给他讲解要领，又把着手教他破篾。学会了破篾，可是又碰上了新的拦路虎，编筐时，篾条一到拐弯处就断了。他又第三次去求师，终于把扭篾的手法也学会了。
    从此，他每天早出晚归，出工前砍来野竹子，破成篾条带到工地，工间休息的哨音一响，他就拖着篾条，带把裁刀，从这个班跑到那个班，见破筐就补。有时在工地补不完，还把破筐带回来，一补就补到深夜。一担担破筐都在刘瑞明手里获得新生。
    刘瑞明自己这担竹筐，更是补了又破，破了又补，前后四十多次。在一次劳动竞赛中，他把筐架都挑断了。有些同志跟他开玩笑：“你这担筐这回总该‘退休’了吧？”他响亮地回答说：“不！我还要让它继续‘服役’！”收工后，他砍下两根野竹子又补起来。筐架断了，要补就得重编一次。一次，二次，三次，……拆了编，编了拆，一直编到第六次，终于成功了，他望着焕然一新的竹筐，高兴地笑了。
    第二天早晨，同志们一看刘瑞明这担破得不像样的竹筐又变成了一担结实的新筐。大家赞叹地说：“刘瑞明这担竹筐上的每条篾都闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉！每一条篾都织下了他对革命，对人民的无限忠诚！”
