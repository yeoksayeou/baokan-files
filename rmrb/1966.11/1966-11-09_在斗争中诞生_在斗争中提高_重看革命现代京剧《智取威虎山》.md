In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" by the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe has once again appeared on the capital's stage with a new look, receiving enthusiastic applause from a wide audience.

The success of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" went through a sharp struggle. It was born in struggle and improved in struggle. It is the fruit of the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front, a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Peking opera revolution of 1964 was a sharp class struggle. The counter-revolutionary revisionist literary clique of Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han initially strongly opposed the Peking opera revolution, attempting to make emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties permanently occupy the Peking opera stage, turning it into a base for their capitalist restoration. Later, they put forward the reactionary line of bourgeois reformism to resist the correct line of thorough revolution in Peking opera, attempting to make the Peking opera revolution die a half-way death. They chose "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" as their target. In 1964, under the instruction of Lin Mo Han, the infamous "Random Notes After Watching 'Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy'" was thrown out, which is the criminal evidence of this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists madly attacking revolutionary modern Peking opera.

The plots of Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han did not succeed. On the contrary, this struggle further strengthened the determination of the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe to uphold revolutionary aspirations and walk the revolutionary path. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they understood that the enemy's opposition precisely indicated that their direction was correct. The enemy opposed not just one play "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," but the Peking opera revolution and the great Mao Zedong Thought. To counterattack the enemy and carry the Peking opera revolution to the end, they must follow the direction of the Peking opera revolution pointed out by Chairman Mao, and demand high standards for the creation and performance of this model play, making it increasingly perfect.

Today, the new flower blooming on the revolutionary Peking opera stage is the result of the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe, under the personal guidance of the responsible comrades of the Party who uphold Chairman Mao's literary line and the Party's line of revolutionizing Peking opera, repeatedly delving into life, repeatedly revising, and undergoing ten major revisions.

Compared to the 1964 version, the most striking impression of this performance is that the play has made great strides in deepening the theme and highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, and in shaping heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

That "Random Notes" had fervently advocated that the focus of the adaptation should be on the "special struggle in the forest of pines and snow," that is, focusing on the strange plot, thrilling scenes, and tense atmosphere, rather than the educational significance of the theme. It is obvious that they merely wanted the adapter to submit to the old traditions of Peking opera, pursue the legendary nature of the plot, and pursue the thrilling activities of the characters, in order to achieve their evil purpose of opposing the deepening of the revolutionary theme of the work and opposing the shaping of proletarian hero images. The new version, on the other hand, directly opposes this, completely abandoning the pursuit of thrilling plots and legendary colors, first focusing on deepening the theme, summarizing the dramatic plot based on historical facts, and arranging dramatic conflicts. Although the heroes appearing on the stage are still the thirty-six-man pursuit team, and the elimination of the bandits on Tiger Mountain is still "taking by strategy," this "taking by strategy" is filled with new content of struggle, radiating new revolutionary splendor. It is no longer an isolated heroic legend far removed from the people's liberation war, but is rooted in the soil of the people's war. The adaptation integrates the bandit-suppression struggle of the pursuit team into the historical background of victorious advance and the establishment of a solid Northeast base, illuminating the era significance of this struggle with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is based on the bandit-suppression struggle in the winter of 1946 in the area around Mudanjiang in Northeast China. At that time, the task was to establish a solid revolutionary base. Chairman Mao issued instructions: to stand firm, one must mobilize the masses, eliminate bandits, establish political power, stabilize the local area, cooperate with the field army, and crush the Kuomintang's attacks. This is a concrete manifestation of Chairman Mao's great people's war thought. Since the heroes of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" are active in such a broad historical background, they must deeply reflect the theme of this era.

The new adaptation, in exploring this new theme, presents the heroic deeds of the thirty-six-man pursuit team. To make this new theme stand out through the dramatic plot, it is necessary to thoroughly change the erroneous tendency in the original novel that overly pursues legend and separates revolutionary warriors from the masses, integrating the bandit-suppression activities of the pursuit team into the historical plot of the victorious advance of the people's war, highlighting their realistic political content from this new plot.

This new theme and plot structure not only truly reproduced the original color of the pursuit team as the people's children, but also more vividly reflected Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that the unity of soldiers and civilians is the guarantee of victory. Here, the pursuit team is both a bandit-suppression team and a work team organizing and mobilizing the masses. They always act in the interests of the people, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, and never forgetting to serve the people. Suppressing the bandits is for the people; rescuing Changbao and Li Laoyi is for the people; organizing the production and self-rescue of the people in Jiajiugou is also for the people. As the commander of the pursuit team, Shao Jianbo, expresses in his aria: "The pursuit team bears a heavy responsibility for the people, the front line supports the rear, the will is as firm as iron, climbing steep mountains and breaking through difficulties, determined to let the sunlight shine on the deep valleys and mountains." And the people in this new plot are no longer just the backward objects to be saved, as depicted in the novel or the previous adaptation, but the protagonists in the struggle, the iron support of the people's children. The new adaptation, through the guidance of the hunter Old Zhang's father and daughter, and the active participation of Jiajiugou's people, Li Yongqi and Dashan in the bandit-suppression struggle, vividly reflects Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of loving the people, the people supporting the soldiers, and the soldiers and people fighting together in the people's war.

This new theme and plot structure run through a clear red line of class struggle. The playwright observes and reflects this bandit-suppression struggle from the perspective of class struggle, grasping its essence. Here, the playwright especially highlights the strong class hatred of the people towards the bandits. In the second scene "Jiajiugou Plundered," worker Li Yongqi's fierce resistance against the bandits of Zuo Mountain Tiger, and the newly added third scene "Questioning in the Deep Mountains," the blood and tears of Old Zhang's father and daughter, all vividly depict this red line of class struggle, showing that this thirty-six-man pursuit team will ignite a class struggle in the deep valleys.

The new adaptation's clear class perspective is also reflected in the observation and depiction of the enemy. In the new dramatic plot, the bandit Zuo Mountain Tiger, instead of being exaggerated in appearance and manner, is especially highlighted in his political banditry. Zuo Mountain Tiger, a veteran of three generations (the warlord Zhang Zuolin period, the Japanese occupation period, and the Kuomintang rule period), is a typical image of the collusion of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. His mad burning, looting, and slaughter reflect the signs of the imminent collapse of the reactionary rule, as well as the desperate struggle of the class enemy unwilling to leave the historical stage.

Because the new adaptation is based on such a broad historical background, using the class perspective to refine the dramatic plot and deepen the theme, it greatly enhances the ideological and educational significance of this play.

Based on a new and deeper understanding of historical truth and life contradictions, the playwright also recreated the image of the pursuit team's heroes, with the most impressive being Yang Zirong.

In the "Random Notes" directed by Lin Mo Han, the author boasted that the original version of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" portrayed Yang Zirong as "always remembering his identity as a scout, always remembering his arduous task," and that this had its limitations, making Yang Zirong's character more constrained and gloomy, and his talents not fully displayed. In short, in their view, Yang Zirong had too little "bandit" spirit, and highlighting Yang Zirong's heroic image of suppressing the bandits' evil with revolutionary righteousness on Tiger Mountain hindered his personal "talents" when disguised as a bandit. Their actual purpose was to attempt to defame the proletarian revolutionary heroes on the modern Peking opera stage and lead the Peking opera revolution astray onto the revisionist path. The new version resolutely resisted this revisionist fallacy and, through a series of carefully designed details and moving scenes, established Yang Zirong's brilliant heroic image.

The heroic image of Yang Zirong on today's stage is a steel soldier tempered in the revolutionary war under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. The playwright convincingly shows that this proletarian revolutionary warrior's courage and wisdom in the face of danger do not come from personal intelligence, but from his unlimited loyalty to the Party, the people, and the revolutionary cause, and his deep hatred for the reactionary ruling class. The new version fully describes this, laying the groundwork for his sharp struggle to suppress the bandits on Tiger Mountain. When Yang Zirong heard the tragic story of the hunter Old Zhang, he immediately stirred up his boundless indignation: "Little Changbao denounced the bandits' crimes, every word is blood, every sound is tears, stirring up my hatred. All oppressed people in the world have a book of blood and tears, seeking revenge, seeking justice, blood debts must be repaid with blood." This is the strongest emotion a revolutionary warrior shows towards the suffering of the working people. In the fourth scene "Planning," Shao Jianbo, when choosing the object to infiltrate the bandit's nest, once wrote a small biography for Yang Zirong, which further highlighted this hero's revolutionary spirit of "heart red as fire, will firm as steel." Yang Zirong, who comes from a family of hired laborers, has his own book of blood and tears. It is the deep hatred of class oppression and exploitation that drives him onto the revolutionary path; while the great Mao Zedong Thought is the only spiritual source of his great wisdom and loyalty. Listen to his words full of passion!

A Communist Party member always listens to the Party's call,
Shouldering the heaviest burdens.
Determined to smash the thousand-year-old iron chains,
Opening the spring of happiness for generations to come for the people.

Only heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought have such great aspirations—"Willing to let the red flag fly over the five continents and four seas, even if it means rushing into a sea of fire and knives. Eager to order the flying snow to melt into spring water, welcoming spring to change the world." Yang Zirong of yesterday is the Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, and Liu Yingjun of today. "Resisting the cold and turning ice and snow into sunshine in my chest," this "sunshine" is the great Mao Zedong Thought, and warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force.

In the fifth scene "Climbing the Mountain to Fight the Tiger," the sixth scene "Entering the Bandit's Den," the eighth scene "Sending Information," and the tenth scene "Meeting at the Banquet of a Hundred Chickens," the sharp dramatic conflicts, one after another, push the tense struggle between the enemy and us to a climax. Each round of struggle is a severe test of Yang Zirong's heroic character, testing wisdom, courage, will, and strength. However, the heroic Yang Zirong, in this round after round of tense struggle, stands tall with his unyielding posture, fearless heroic spirit, and the great wisdom and courage of a revolutionary, letting the "sunshine in his chest"—the great Mao Zedong Thought—shine brilliantly, suppressing the bandits' evil.

These scenes are originally very legendary and thrilling, but the new adaptation does not focus on the "legendary" aspects. It does not allow Yang Zirong's heroic image to be damaged by "bandit" spirit, but focuses on highlighting Yang Zirong's righteousness of suppressing evil with good, and on depicting his image of high spirits and heroic vigor. Therefore, Yang Zirong's infiltration of Tiger Mountain and his interactions with the bandits not only do not hide his noble qualities as a Communist Party member but also highlight his heroic character of great wisdom and courage.

It is precisely because the new adaptation has fully and deeply described the ideological foundation of this heroic character that it powerfully shows that Yang Zirong is a hero of our time, not a "chivalrous hero" from the old Peking opera tradition. If the smart struggle on Tiger Mountain showcases Yang Zirong's "wisdom," then this "wisdom" is not the "romantic" bandit spirit that the "Random Notes" maliciously advocated, but the wisdom of revolutionary romanticism of the proletarian revolution, nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the wisdom of "thousands and thousands of class brothers as if by my side." The new adaptation deeply and powerfully showcases Yang Zirong's wisdom and bravery, not relying on the legendary personal intelligence, but because he has "sunshine in his chest." It is precisely because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that he has conducted a thorough investigation and study of the enemy situation, and is confident of victory, that he possesses the heroic spirit of suppressing all enemies without being suppressed by them. Such a revolutionary warrior, such a heroic figure, is not only unbeatable by the bandits on Tiger Mountain but also unbeatable by the entire old world. Look at how resolute and decisive he is when volunteering, how calm and composed he is in front of the vicious bandits, how calm and wise he is when outsmarting Lun Ping, and how righteous and overpowering he is. All expressions of his heroic character shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In addition to Yang Zirong's heroic image, the new adaptation of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" also prominently shapes the heroic image of the pursuit team commander Shao Jianbo, focusing on depicting his character of strategic planning and decisive leadership, making up for the weakness in the original adaptation where the Party's leadership was not strongly portrayed.

Like Yang Zirong's heroic image, the recreation of Shao Jianbo's commander image in the new adaptation is also carried out under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. As a commander, he is the pivot of the plot development. It is he who represents the Party in commanding the pursuit team in this struggle, and it is he who leads heroes like Yang Zirong. If a tall commander image is not shaped, the theme of the work cannot be deeply reflected, nor can the image of Yang Zirong be powerfully highlighted. The playwright shapes Shao Jianbo's heroic image with political emphasis. The scenes "Planning" and "Mobilizing the Masses" vividly depict the commander Shao Jianbo's deep understanding of Chairman Mao's military thought and mass line. It is precisely because of the great Mao Zedong Thought that he can correctly understand the situation, correctly analyze the enemy situation, correctly educate the soldiers, correctly use cadres, correctly rely on the masses, and use Chairman Mao's people's war thought to mobilize the mountain people, flexibly and strategically command the pursuit team's bandit-suppression struggle. Making the audience deeply feel that the thirty-six-man pursuit team under his leadership is an invincible collective, a microcosm of our great people's army. A strong leader has no weak soldiers. In Yang Zirong's great wisdom and courage, there is the spiritual imprint of Shao Jianbo, the strong influence of Shao Jianbo. In the scene "Planning," Shao Jianbo and Yang Zirong's tacit understanding about "taking Tiger Mountain by strategy" reflects their common qualities and the flash of their common wisdom. Therefore, although Shao Jianbo is not the "main character" in the play and appears less often, he fully shows his "main character" role in the struggle in the play. People feel his strength and the strong leadership of the Party he represents from Yang Zirong's brave, fearless, and flexible struggle.

Of course, the achievements of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" are inseparable from its artistic pursuit of excellence. Its concise and concentrated scenes (originally twenty-three large and small scenes, now condensed into ten), the ups and downs of dramatic conflicts, clear layers, greatly overcome the flaws of the original version in structure being bloated, scattered, and flat. Its complete set of arias, the ice-skating dance refined from life, and the unique and beautiful shapes in each scene, especially its revolutionary yet not losing the flavor of Peking opera literary language, have enriched the art of revolutionary modern Peking opera and made its unique contribution among several model plays.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slandering us as worthless and useless, that would be even better, proving that we not only draw a clear line with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great results." Nothing can be achieved without destruction, nothing can flow without obstruction, and nothing can be achieved without stopping. This is the revolutionary dialectics of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Under the close care and guidance of the responsible comrades of the Party, the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe, in the struggle with Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and Zhou Xinfan and the like, firmly implemented the correct line of thorough revolution in Peking opera, continuously revolutionizing and improving along the correct direction of the 1964 adaptation, highlighting the great Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, and created this high-quality model play, shining brilliantly on the stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Peking opera.

    在斗争中诞生　在斗争中提高
    ——重看革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》
    泽雨
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，上海革命京剧文工团的革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》，又以崭新的面貌出现在首都舞台上，受到了广大观众的热烈欢迎。
    《智取威虎山》的成功，经历了一场尖锐的斗争。它是在斗争中诞生，在斗争中提高的。它是文化战线上两条路线斗争的果实，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    一九六四年的京剧革命，是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。周扬、林默涵反革命修正主义文艺集团，始而竭力反对京剧革命，妄想使帝王将相、才子佳人永远霸占京剧舞台，成为他们复辟资本主义的阵地；继而又抛出资产阶级改良主义的反动路线来抵制京剧彻底革命的正确路线，妄图使京剧革命半途夭折。他们选中了《智取威虎山》作为进攻的靶子。一九六四年，在林默涵的指使下抛出的臭名昭彰的《〈智取威虎山〉观后漫笔》，就是这伙反革命修正主义分子疯狂攻击革命现代京剧的罪证。
    周扬、林默涵一伙的阴谋并没有得逞。相反，这斗争更加坚定了上海革命京剧文工团立革命志、走革命路的决心。他们在毛泽东思想的指导下，懂得敌人的反对，正说明自己的方向是正确的。敌人反对的，并不是一出《智取威虎山》，而是反对京剧革命，反对伟大的毛泽东思想。为了反击敌人，将京剧革命进行到底，就必须沿着毛主席所指出的京剧革命的方向，高标准地要求这出样板戏的创作和演出，使它日臻完美。
    今天，在革命京剧舞台上盛开的这朵新花，正是上海革命京剧文工团在坚持毛主席的文艺路线、坚持京剧革命化的党的负责同志的亲自指导下，不断深入生活、反复加工、十次大改的成果。
    对照一九六四年的改编，这次演出给人最突出鲜明的印象，就是这出戏在深化主题、突出毛泽东思想的探索上，在塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物上，都有了极大的提高。
    那篇《漫笔》曾经狂热地鼓吹改编的着眼点，应该是“林海雪原中的特殊斗争”，也就是着眼于离奇的情节、惊险的场面、紧张的气氛，而不是主题思想的教育意义。显而易见，他们无非是要改编者屈从于京剧的旧传统，追求情节的传奇性，追求人物的惊险活动，以便达到他们反对深化作品的革命主题，反对塑造无产阶级英雄形象的险恶目的。《智取威虎山》的新编本则针锋相对，完全摈弃了那种对惊险情节和传奇色彩的追求，首先从深化主题着眼，根据历史的真实，重新概括了戏剧情节，安排了戏剧冲突。尽管出现在舞台上的英雄人物，仍然是那三十六个人的追剿队，剿除威虎山的顽匪座山雕，依然是“智取”。但是，这个“智取”却充实了新的斗争内容，焕发出了新的革命光彩，它不再是远离人民解放战争的孤立的英雄传奇，而是植根在人民战争的土壤上的。改编把追剿队的剿匪斗争融合在胜利进军、建立巩固的东北根据地的历史背景里，用伟大的毛泽东思想照亮了这一斗争的时代意义。
    《智取威虎山》取材于一九四六年冬东北牡丹江一带的剿匪斗争。当时，摆在面前的问题，是如何建立巩固的革命根据地。毛主席发出指示：要想立住脚跟，就必须发动群众，消灭土匪，建立政权，以便稳固地方，配合野战军，粉碎国民党的进攻。这是毛主席的伟大人民战争思想的具体表现。智取威虎山的英雄们既然是活跃在这样广阔的历史背景里，他们就必须深刻地体现这个时代的主题。
    新的改编，正是在这一新的主题的探索中，表现这支三十六人追剿队的英雄业绩的。为了使这一新的主题通过戏剧情节突出地表现出来，就必须彻底改变小说原作中那种过分追求传奇性、从而使革命战士脱离群众的错误倾向，把追剿队的剿匪活动融合在人民战争胜利进军的历史情节里，从这新的情节里突出他们斗争行动的现实的政治内容。
    这新的主题和情节结构，不仅真实地再现了追剿队的人民子弟兵的本色，也更鲜明地体现了毛主席的军民血肉一体是取得胜利的保证的光辉思想。在这里，追剿队既是剿匪队，又是组织群众，宣传群众的工作队。他们处处从人民利益出发，牢记毛主席的教导，时刻不忘为人民服务。追剿座山雕，是为人民；抢救常宝和李大娘，是为人民；组织夹皮沟群众生产自救，也是为人民。正如追剿队的指挥员少剑波的一段唱词所表达的壮志豪情那样：“追剿队为人民肩负重担，支前线安后方志如铁坚，越峻岭攀绝壁冲破艰险，定要叫阳光普照幽谷深山。”而人民群众在这新的情节里，也不再像小说或过去的改编本所表现的那样，只是被拯救的落后的对象，而是斗争中的主人公，人民子弟兵的铁靠山。新的改编通过猎户老常父女的引路，夹皮沟群众李勇奇和大山的积极参加剿匪斗争，生动地体现了毛主席的军爱民、民拥军、军民一体进行人民战争的伟大战略思想。
    这个新的主题思想和情节结构，贯串着一条鲜明的阶级斗争的红线。剧作者是用阶级斗争的观点来观察和反映这场剿匪斗争，把握住它的本质的。在这里，剧作者特别突出了人民群众对顽匪的强烈的阶级仇恨。第二场《夹皮沟遭劫》中工人李勇奇对座山雕匪徒的奋力反抗，新增加的第三场《深山问苦》中老常父女的血泪控诉，都鲜明地勾勒了这条阶级斗争的红线，显示出这支三十六人的追剿队必将在幽谷深山里点燃起一场阶级斗争的烈火。
    新的改编的鲜明的阶级观点，同样贯串在对敌人的观察和反映上。在新的戏剧情节里出现的顽匪座山雕，剧作者并没有在他的外形和气焰上作过分的渲染，而是特别地突出了他的政治顽匪的一面。三代（军阀张作霖时期、日本统治时期、蒋介石统治时期）元老的座山雕，是帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本主义相互勾结的一个典型的形象。他那疯狂的焚掠屠杀，既反映了反动统治即将溃灭的征兆，又表现了阶级敌人不肯退出历史舞台的垂死挣扎。
    由于新的改编是在这样广阔的历史背景上，运用阶级观点提炼戏剧情节，深化主题的，它就大大提高了这出戏的思想教育意义。
    基于对历史真实和生活矛盾的新的更深刻的认识，剧作者对追剿队的英雄形象也进行了再创造，其中给人印象最深的是杨子荣。
    在林默涵的指使下炮制出来的那篇《漫笔》中，作者大放厥词，说什么《智取威虎山》原编本表现杨子荣“时刻不忘自己侦察员的身份，时刻不忘自己艰巨的任务”，“有它一定的局限，即杨子荣的性格变得较为拘束和沉郁，他的才智没能得到充分的表现”。一句话，在他们看来，杨子荣身上的“匪”气太少了，突出了杨子荣在威虎山以革命正气压倒群匪凶焰的英雄形象，就妨碍了他在假扮匪徒时发挥个人的“才智”。醉翁之意不在酒，不管他们的话说得多么动听，其实际目的是妄图在现代京剧舞台上丑化无产阶级的革命英雄形象，把京剧革命引向修正主义的邪路上去。新编本坚决抵制了这个修正主义的谬论，通过一系列精心设计的细节和激动人心的场面，树立了杨子荣的光采夺目的英雄形象。
    今天舞台上出现在人们面前的杨子荣的英雄形象，是在毛泽东思想照耀下，在革命战争烈火中冶炼出来的钢铁战士。剧作者令人信服地展示了，这个无产阶级革命战士的临危不惧的大智大勇，首先绝不是来自个人的聪明才智，而是来自他对党、对人民、对革命事业的无限忠诚，来自他对反动统治阶级的深仇大恨。新编本在这方面展开了充分的描写，为他在威虎山上威慑群魔的尖锐斗争埋下了伏笔。杨子荣一听到猎户老常的悲惨身世时，立即唤起了他对座山雕的无限激愤：“小常宝控诉了土匪罪状，字字血，声声泪，激起我仇恨满腔。普天下被压迫人民都有一本血泪账，要报仇，要伸冤，血债要用血来偿。”这是一个革命战士对劳动人民的苦难表现出来的最强烈的感情。第四场《定计》中，少剑波在选择深入匪巢的对象时，曾经为杨子荣立了一个小传，这就更突出了这个英雄人物“心红红似火，志坚坚如钢”的革命气概。“出身雇农本质好”的杨子荣，自己就有一本血泪账。是阶级压迫、阶级剥削的深仇大恨，推动他走上了革命的道路；而伟大的毛泽东思想又是他的大智大勇、赤胆忠心的唯一精神源泉。请听听他的充满豪情的誓言吧！
    共产党员时刻听从党召唤，
    专拣重担挑在肩。
    一心要砸碎千年铁锁链，
    为人民开出万代幸福泉。
    只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄战士，才有这样的豪情壮志——“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展，哪怕是火海刀山也扑上前。恨不得急令飞雪化春水，迎来春天换人间。”昨天的杨子荣，就是今天的雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊……。“抗严寒化冰雪我胸有朝阳”，这“朝阳”就是伟大的毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士是最大的战斗力。
    第五场《打虎上山》，第六场《打进匪窟》，第八场《计送情报》，第十场《会师百鸡宴》，尖锐的戏剧冲突，一环紧扣一环，一浪高过一浪，把敌我双方的紧张斗争逐步推向了高潮。每一回合的斗争，都是对杨子荣英雄性格的一次严峻的考验，斗智、斗勇、斗意志、斗力量。但是，英雄的杨子荣，却在这一次又一次的紧张的斗争中，以傲岸的雄姿，无畏的英雄气概，革命者的大智大勇，让“胸中的朝阳”——伟大的毛泽东思想放射出夺目的光辉，压倒了群匪的凶焰。
    这几场本来都是传奇性很强的惊险场面，但是，新的改编本却没有把“文章”做在传奇性上。它绝不让杨子荣的英雄形象受“匪”气的损害，而是着力于突出杨子荣的以正压邪的正气，着力于刻划他的意志昂扬、英气逼人的形象。因而，杨子荣闯上威虎山，周旋于匪徒之间，不仅丝毫没有遮掩住他的共产党员的高尚气质，而是更突出了他的大智大勇的英雄性格。
    正是由于新改编本对这个英雄性格的思想基础展开了充分而深刻的描写，它才强有力地表现出杨子荣是我们时代的英雄人物，而绝不是旧京剧传统里的“江湖豪侠”。如果说威虎山上的智斗发挥了杨子荣的“才智”，那么，这种“才智”，也绝不是《漫笔》别有用心地鼓吹的那种“浪漫主义”的匪气，而是渗透着革命无产阶级大智大勇的革命浪漫主义的才智，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育出来的才智，是“千百万阶级兄弟犹如在身旁”的才智。新的改编本深刻有力地展示了杨子荣的才略胆识，并不是靠传奇性的个人的聪明才智，而是因为他“胸有朝阳”。正是依靠了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对敌情进行了周密的调查和研究，胜算在握，他才具有压倒一切敌人而绝不被敌人所压倒的英雄气概。这样的革命战士，这样的英雄人物，岂只是威虎山上的群丑所不能战胜的，也是整个旧世界所无法战胜的。你看他在请战时多么坚决果敢，你看他在穷凶极恶的群丑面前多么从容镇定，你看他在智斗栾平时多么沉着机智，多么正气凌人。他的英雄性格的一切表现，都闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    和杨子荣的英雄形象相互辉映，相互补充，《智取威虎山》的新的改编本，还特别突出地塑造了追剿队指挥员少剑波的英雄形象，着力刻划他运筹帷幄、英明果断的性格，弥补了原改编本中党的领导表现得不够强有力的缺点。
    像杨子荣的英雄形象一样，在新的改编本里，少剑波的指挥员形象的再创造，也是在毛泽东思想照耀下进行的。作为指挥员，他是剧情发展的枢纽。是他代表党在指挥追剿队进行这场斗争，也是他在领导杨子荣这样的英雄战士。如果不能塑造出一个高大的指挥员的形象，就不能深刻地体现作品的主题，也不能有力地烘托出杨子荣的形象。剧作者是以突出政治为纲，塑造少剑波的英雄形象的。《定计》和《发动群众》两场，集中而生动地写出了指挥员少剑波对毛主席的军事思想和群众路线有着深刻的体会。就是由于有了伟大的毛泽东思想的武装，他才能正确地认识形势，正确地分析敌情，正确地教育战士，正确地使用干部，正确地依靠群众，用毛主席的人民战争的思想，发动山区群众，机动灵活地指挥了追剿队的剿匪斗争。使观众深切地感受到，在他领导下的三十六人的追剿队，就是一个战无不胜的集体，就是我们伟大的人民军队的一个缩影。强将手下无弱兵，在杨子荣的大智大勇中，有着少剑波的精神印迹，有着少剑波的强烈影响。《定计》一场中少剑波与杨子荣关于“智取”威虎山的默契，映照出了他们的共同品质，共同的思想智慧的闪光。因而，少剑波虽不是戏中的“主角”，出场也不多，但在戏里却充分显示了他在斗争中的“主角”作用，人们从杨子荣的英勇无畏机智灵活的斗争中感到了他的力量，感到了他所代表的党的坚强领导作用。
    当然，《智取威虎山》所取得的成就，与它艺术上的精益求精是分不开的。它的场次的精炼和集中（原为大小二十三场，现压缩为十场），戏剧冲突的波澜起伏，层次分明，大大地克服了原编本在结构上臃肿、分散、平直的缺陷。它的成套的唱腔，从生活中提炼出来的滑雪舞蹈，以及每场戏里的独创的优美造型，特别是它的革命化的又不失京剧韵味的文学语言，都丰富了革命现代京剧的艺术，在几个样板戏中做出了它特有的贡献。
    毛主席指出：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，这是伟大的毛泽东思想的革命辩证法。上海革命京剧文工团在党的负责同志的亲切关怀和指导下，正是在和周扬、林默涵、周信芳之流的斗争中，坚决地贯彻了京剧彻底革命的正确路线，沿着一九六四年改编本雏型的正确方向不断革命，不断提高，处处突出伟大毛泽东思想，才创作了这出高质量的样板戏，在无产阶级文化大革命的京剧舞台上大放异彩。
