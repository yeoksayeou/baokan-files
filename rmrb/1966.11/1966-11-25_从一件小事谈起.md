In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, I not only learned to read, but also understood many revolutionary principles, especially in the transformation of my worldview, where I fought a battle to eliminate bourgeois thoughts and promote proletarian ones. Take the task of emptying the spittoon, for example: During our class's clean-up of internal hygiene, I was responsible for emptying the spittoon. The first time I went to empty it, seeing the phlegm inside, I felt nauseous and turned my face away, really not wanting to do this task.

Later, with the patient help of the instructor, I repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In this article, Chairman Mao said: "We all should learn from his spirit of complete selflessness. From this point on, one can become a person of great benefit to the people. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a person of high moral character, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has risen above petty interests, and a person of benefit to the people." I thought, Bethune was a famous surgeon who often performed operations on wounded soldiers. Surely, he must have seen plenty of pus and sores? Yet, Comrade Bethune was a high-minded communist warrior, and for the sake of the wounded, he was not afraid of these things. The more I thought about it, the more I felt I was wrong. Not wanting to empty the spittoon was actually due to bourgeois thoughts. Bethune had no selfish motives, which is why he became a high-minded and pure person. From this, I understood that no matter what task one does, one should not have selfish motives. In the world, there are only dirty thoughts, no dirty work. Afterwards, I no longer felt that emptying the spittoon was dirty.

    从一件小事谈起
    新战士　刘武成
    我在学习毛主席著作辅导班里，不但学会了识字，还懂得了不少革命道理，特别在世界观改造方面打了一场灭资兴无的思想仗。就拿倒痰盂这件事来说吧：我们班在整理内务卫生的时候，我负责倒痰盂。我第一次去倒痰盂，一见痰盂里的口痰，就感到发呕，脸朝着一边，真不想干这差事。
    后来，我在辅导员的耐心帮助下，反复学习了《纪念白求恩》，毛主席在这篇文章中说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”我想，白求恩是个著名的外科医生，经常给伤病员动手术，难道还少脓啊疮的吗？可是，白求恩同志是个高尚的共产主义战士，为了伤病员，他就不怕这些。我越想越觉得自己不对。不愿意倒痰盂，实际上是资产阶级思想在作怪。白求恩毫无私心，才成了一个高尚的人、纯粹的人。从这里使我懂得了不管做啥子事情，都不能有私心，世界上只有脏的思想，没有脏的工作。以后，我每天倒痰盂都不觉得脏了。
