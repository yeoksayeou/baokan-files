	Forestry workers in the water transportation team of the Wutiao timber yard, Jianning County Forestry Industry Bureau in northern Fujian, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have displayed a spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to make revolution, creating the "land-based sorting" method. This has promoted the water transportation of timber.

	The land-based sorting method involves constructing a work platform by the river. Workers gather the timber on the platform, and after assembling one section of the timber raft, they press the automatic control rod to advance or retreat. The timber raft then automatically slides down the chute into the river. Using this method, assembling one section of the timber raft can save one-third of the manpower and increase work efficiency by more than onefold. It greatly reduces the labor intensity, and regardless of whether it is sunny, rainy, day or night, in severe winter or the flood season, timber rafts can be assembled.

    闽北林区创“陆地装排”法
    闽北林区建宁县森林工业局武调伐木场水运队工人，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬敢想敢干敢革命的精神，创造了“陆地装排”法，促进了木材水运工作。
    陆地装排法是在河边造一个工作台，工人们把木材集运到工作台面上，每装好一节木排，一按自动控制进退杆，木排就自动从下滑道送往河里。用这种方法，装一节木排，可以节省人力三分之一，提高工效一倍多，大大减轻了劳动强度，而且不论晴雨昼夜，严冬或洪水季节，都能装排。　　　（据新华社讯）
