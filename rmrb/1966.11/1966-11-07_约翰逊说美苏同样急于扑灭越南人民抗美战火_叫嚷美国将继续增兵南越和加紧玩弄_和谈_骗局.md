	Johnson Says the U.S. and the Soviet Union Are Equally Eager to Extinguish the Vietnamese People's Anti-American Fire
	Shouts That the U.S. Will Continue to Send More Troops to South Vietnam and Intensify the "Peace Talks" Deception

	According to a November 5th Xinhua News Agency report from Washington: U.S. President Johnson, in a press conference on November 4th, indicated that after the Manila meeting, U.S. imperialism will intensify its war blackmail and "peace talks" deception counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, attempting to make a desperate struggle in its increasingly disastrous war of aggression.

	Johnson, after participating in the Manila meeting and visiting U.S. allies in the Vietnam War, held his first press conference upon returning to the country, emphasizing that at the Manila meeting, the head of U.S. forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland, had already stated that the U.S. would "need to increase troops" in South Vietnam. Johnson said: "I think we will increase our strength from time to time," "and when he (Westmoreland) requests more troops, we will supply them." He also said: "If they (U.S. forces in Vietnam) need anything else, it will definitely be sent." Johnson also urged U.S. allies in the Vietnam War to "do what they deem appropriate and necessary" in this war. Johnson also revealed that the U.S. would further expand its bombing of North Vietnam. The same day, the New York Times reported: "Defense Department planners are drafting plans to significantly escalate bombing operations in North Vietnam." Johnson's rhetoric indicates that U.S. imperialism will continue its war of aggression and will not rest until it suffers a thorough defeat.

	Johnson indicated that while the U.S. is playing its "gradual escalation" strategy, it will also intensify its "peace talks" conspiracy. In the press conference, he reiterated the "peace" clichés, saying that the U.S. hopes "to stop the war today," "to stop it this minute." He again advocated the so-called "withdrawal within six months" trick played at the Manila meeting, openly blackmailing the Vietnamese people. Johnson also revealed that the Soviet revisionist clique, like the U.S., is eager to see the Vietnamese people stop their anti-American national liberation struggle. He said he had "every reason to believe" that Soviet leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin "want to see this fight stop, to the same degree that we want to see this fight stop."

	To promote the doomed-to-fail U.S. imperialist plans for the Vietnam War formulated at the Manila meeting, the Johnson administration is currently dividing its forces into three groups, sending envoys to lobby for support for these plans. Ambassador-at-Large Harriman, after visiting Southeast Asia, is currently visiting Western Europe. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Bundy has been engaged in conspiracy activities in Japan, Taiwan, and other places. Former President of the World Bank and Johnson's special advisor on Southeast Asian affairs, Black, is on a five-week visit to eleven countries and regions.

    约翰逊说美苏同样急于扑灭越南人民抗美战火
    叫嚷美国将继续增兵南越和加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊四日在记者招待会上表明，在马尼拉会议之后，美帝国主义将加紧推行战争讹诈和“和谈”欺骗的反革命两手策略，妄图在越败越惨的侵略战争中作绝望的挣扎。
    约翰逊在参加马尼拉会议和遍访美国侵越战争中的仆从之后，回到国内举行的第一次记者招待会上强调，在马尼拉会议上，侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰已经表明，美国在南越“将需要增加兵力”。约翰逊说：“我认为我们将不时地增加力量”，“在他（威斯特摩兰）要求增加兵力的时候，我们将供应这些兵力”。他还说：“如果他们
  （侵越美军）再需要什么，那一定会送去”。约翰逊还鞭策美国的侵越战争仆从，在这场战争中“做它们认为可取和必要的事情”。约翰逊还透露，美国要进一步扩大对越南北方的轰炸。同一天的《纽约时报》说：“国防部的计划人员正在草拟使轰炸北越的行动再次作重大升级的计划。”约翰逊的叫嚣表明，美帝国主义要继续进行战争冒险，它在战争中不遭到彻底失败是不会甘休的。
    约翰逊表明，美国在玩弄它的“逐步升级”战略的同时，还要大搞“和谈”阴谋。他在记者招待会上重弹“和平”滥调，说什么美国希望“今天就使战争停止下来”，“这一分钟就使它停止下来”。他再次鼓吹在马尼拉会议上玩弄的所谓“六个月内撤军”的花招，对越南人民进行露骨的讹诈。约翰逊还透露，苏联修正主义集团同美国一样迫不及待地要越南人民停止抗美救国斗争。他说，他“有充分理由相信”，苏联领导人勃列日涅夫和柯西金，“希望看到这场战斗停止，其程度同我们希望看到这场战斗停止的程度一样大”。
    为了推销美帝国主义在马尼拉会议上制定的注定要破产的侵越战争计划，约翰逊政府目前正兵分三路，派人四出游说，搜罗对这些计划的支持。巡回大使哈里曼在访问东南亚地区后，目前正在西欧进行访问。远东事务助理国务卿威·邦迪，到日本、台湾等地进行了阴谋活动。前世界银行行长、约翰逊东南亚事务特别顾问布莱克正在十一个国家和地区进行历时五周的访问。
