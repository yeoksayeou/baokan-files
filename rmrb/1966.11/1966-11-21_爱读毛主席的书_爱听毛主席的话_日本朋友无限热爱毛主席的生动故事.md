The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, currently on a visit to Japan, has encountered numerous instances of Japanese friends' deep affection for Chairman Mao and the vivid stories of Mao Zedong Thought.

I Will Definitely Study Chairman Mao's Books Well

During the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe's performance in Tokyo, they met Tanaka Toshiyuki, a dancer from the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe. This young dancer had visited China three times and harbored deep feelings for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. He enthusiastically assisted the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe with their performances in Tokyo.

Once, the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe presented him with a Japanese edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He took it and held it to his chest, passionately declaring, "I will definitely study it well and become a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

Later, he also wrote a letter to the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, expressing his enthusiasm: "The 700 million people of China are true friends and comrades of the Japanese people." In his letter, he pointed out: "Although the current situation in Japan is very complex, no matter what happens, no matter what obstacles and sabotage we encounter, it is absolutely impossible to destroy the friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China."

Tanaka concluded his letter in Chinese: "We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: 'Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory.' 'Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!'"

Firmly Following the Words of the Great Helmsman Chairman Mao

Nakamura Yoshio, a worker from the national railway in Saitama Prefecture, is a friend the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe met during their performances. This friend wrote a letter after watching the troupe's performance, saying: "Every morning and evening, we listen to broadcasts from Beijing. We firmly follow the words of the great helmsman Mao Zedong, adhere to the teachings of Mao Zedong, unite with the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world, and struggle to overthrow imperialism."

Nakamura also requested in his letter that the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe send him a few copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" so that he and his comrades could study Chairman Mao's teachings more deeply.

Holding High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

A Japanese friend from Osaka City said after watching the performance that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Some people say we are blindly worshipping, and they put big hats on us. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, whether we can do this is the dividing line between following the revolutionary path or the revisionist path. He also said, watching the performance has given us more strength, and that is why the revisionists are so afraid of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe's performances.

The Most Precious Gift

The troupe members also encountered the following incident: A Japanese friend presented a Mao Zedong badge, which he had made himself, as the most precious gift to a Chinese performer. The badge was inscribed with the words "A single spark can start a prairie fire." The Japanese friend said, "This badge is a symbol of our love for Chairman Mao Zedong."

Greetings to Chairman Mao, Long Live Chairman Mao!

A young Japanese friend from Ishikawa Prefecture, upon seeing the members of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, immediately said, "We love Mao Zedong very much, please convey our greetings to Chairman Mao." The next day, the weather suddenly changed, and a storm hit. This friend, dressed in very thin clothes, came to visit the troupe. When the Chinese performers kindly asked if he was cold, he replied, "I have Chairman Mao in my heart, so I feel very warm." Then he took out a small wallet from his pocket, which contained a clipping of Chairman Mao's portrait that he had kept for a long time. He kept touching the clipping and gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait. The performers of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe noticed his emotions and gave him a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a portrait of Chairman Mao. At this moment, he was so happy that tears welled up in his eyes, and he shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The members of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe visited the poor in Kawashima Village, Hiki District, Saitama Prefecture, and presented an elderly woman with a Mao Zedong badge.

    爱读毛主席的书　爱听毛主席的话
    日本朋友无限热爱毛主席的生动故事
    新华社十八日讯　东京消息：正在日本进行访问演出的中国北京歌舞团，遇到了许多日本朋友无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想的生动事例。
        一定好好学习毛主席的书
    北京歌舞团在东京演出时，遇到了日本松山芭蕾舞团演员田中俊行。这位青年演员曾经三次访问过中国，对毛主席和中国人民怀有深厚的感情。他积极热情地帮助北京歌舞团在东京的演出。
    有一次，北京歌舞团把一本日文版的《毛主席语录》赠送给他。他接过后把语录贴近胸前，满怀激情地说：“我一定好好学习，做一名毛主席的好战士。”
    后来，他还专门给北京歌舞团写了一封信，热情洋溢地说：“七亿中国人民是日本人民的真正朋友，是日本人民的真正同志。”他在信中指出：“目前日本的形势虽然很复杂，但是不管出现什么情况，不管遇到什么样的阻挠和破坏，也绝对不可能破坏日中两国人民的友谊和团结。”
    田中在信的最后用中文写道：“我们一定要按照毛主席的指示：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
              坚决听伟大舵手毛主席的话
    埼玉县日本国营铁路工人中村芳雄，是北京歌舞团在演出中结识的朋友。这位朋友在看了歌舞团的演出后写的一封信说：“我们每天早晨和晚上都在收听北京广播。我们坚决听伟大舵手毛泽东主席的话，遵循毛泽东主席的教导，团结全世界受压迫和受剥削的人民，为打倒帝国主义而斗争。”
    中村还在信里要求北京歌舞团送给他几本《毛主席语录》，以便他和他的伙伴们更加深入地学习毛主席的教导。
              更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    大阪市一位日本朋友在观看演出后说，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我们这样说，有人就说我们盲目崇拜，对我们扣大帽子。我们就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗。他说，能不能这样做，这是走革命的道路还是跟修正主义走的分水岭。他还说，看了演出，使我们增添了力量，正是因为这样，修正主义者对中国歌舞团的演出害怕得要死。
                最珍贵的礼物
    歌舞团的同志们还遇到这样一件事：一位日本朋友把他自己制造的毛主席像纪念章当作最珍贵的礼物，赠送给中国演员。这个纪念章上刻有“星星之火，可以燎原”八个大字。这位日本朋友说，这个纪念章是我们热爱毛泽东主席的象征。
              向毛主席问好，毛主席万万岁！
    石川县的一位日本青年朋友，一见到北京歌舞团团员，第一句话就说，我们非常热爱毛泽东，请向毛主席问好。第二天，天气突然变了，起了暴风雨。这位朋友穿着很单薄的衣服来看望歌舞团。当中国演员亲切地问他冷不冷时，他说，我心中有毛泽东，所以感到非常暖和。接着他就从怀里掏出一个小皮夹，里面放着一份看来保存已久的印有毛主席像的剪报，他不停地用手抚摸着这份剪报，端详着毛主席的像。歌舞团的演员看出了他的心情，便送给他一本《毛主席语录》和一张毛主席像。这时，他高兴得热泪盈眶，高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”（附图片）
