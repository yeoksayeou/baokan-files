The brave and intelligent South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces shelled the center of Saigon twice on the morning of November 1st. The shells landed in the area where the American and puppet forces were holding a fake "national day" parade, causing casualties among the participating American and puppet troops and their mercenaries, who fled in disarray and humiliation.

Western news agencies admitted that this was the "largest attack on Saigon" by the Liberation Armed Forces. They reported, "This is the first time the Liberation Armed Forces have used mortars to attack the center of Saigon."

According to reports, to "celebrate" the third anniversary of the overthrow of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, the puppet leaders Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu, along with the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, all participated in this "parade." However, before and after the "parade" began, the parade grounds were shelled twice. Some shells even fell near the reviewing stand. Between the two shellings, the sound of hand grenades and landmines exploding could be heard throughout Saigon. It was also reported that on the same day, the Liberation Armed Forces sank a U.S. Navy minesweeper on a river about 22 kilometers southeast of Saigon, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

On November 1st, the brave and intelligent South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces heavily shelled the center of Saigon. The American and puppet troops participating in the fake "national day" parade were either cowering on the ground in fear or fleeing in all directions, in a state of utter chaos.

    新华社一日讯　西贡消息：英勇机智的越南南方解放武装力量一日上午两次猛烈炮轰西贡市中心。炮弹落到了美伪集团正在举行伪“国庆”检阅的场地，使参加检阅的美伪军和帮凶军遭到了伤亡，四散逃命，狼狈不堪。
    西方通讯社的消息承认，这是解放武装力量“对西贡的规模最大的袭击”。他们“用迫击炮袭击西贡市中心，这还是第一次”。
    据报道，为了“庆祝”推翻吴庭艳政权三周年的所谓“国庆”，南越傀儡集团头目阮高其和阮文绍以及侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰等都参加了这次“检阅”。但是在“检阅”开始之前和开始之后，“检阅”场地两次遭到了炮轰。有些炮弹还落到了检阅台附近。在两次炮轰之间，西贡市内曾不断响起了手榴弹和地雷的爆炸声。另据报道，同一天，解放武装力量在西贡东南约二十二公里的一条河上，还击沉了一艘美国海军扫雷艇，使敌人遭到重大伤亡。（附图片）
