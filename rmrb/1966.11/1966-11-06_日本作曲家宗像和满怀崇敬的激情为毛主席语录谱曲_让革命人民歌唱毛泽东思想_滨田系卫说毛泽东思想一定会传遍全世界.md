Japanese composer, conductor, and deputy leader of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe's visit to China, Munekazu Mushiko, recently composed music for Chairman Mao's quotations with reverence and love for Chairman Mao.

Mushiko composed two pieces of music for Chairman Mao's quotations. One is "In times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see light, and boost our morale." The other is "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." These pieces were created by the musician in early October before and after his visit to Yan'an.

Before the National Day of China, when Mushiko was in Beijing, Chinese friends gave him a Japanese version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He, like all members of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, studied it every day and always carried it with him. The more he studied, the deeper his understanding of Chairman Mao's words became. On his way from Beijing to Yan'an, he composed music for Chairman Mao's quotations with great enthusiasm. During the creation process, he sought the opinions of the young Red Guards on the same train, revised it repeatedly, and completed the first song before arriving in Yan'an. Chinese music and dance workers in Yan'an performed this song during a joint performance with the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe. Not long after leaving Yan'an, Mushiko composed the second song for Chairman Mao's quotations during his travels.

After these two songs were created, they immediately became the most beloved songs among the members of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe.

The leader of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, Seisuke Shimizu, said: Chairman Mao teaches us to see light and have confidence in times of difficulty. Currently, Japan is under the rule of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and recently, a small group of modern revisionists have been causing trouble, making the struggle arduous. However, we must believe in the Japanese masses and always stand with them, confidently striving for victory. Shimizu praised Mushiko's creation, saying: These two songs embody Chairman Mao's teachings, express love for Chairman Mao, and reflect the fighting spirit of the Japanese people.

On the evening of the 28th, when the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe returned to Tokyo, they held up the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at the airport and sang these two new songs composed for Chairman Mao's quotations to the Japanese people and Chinese friends who came to welcome them. The welcome party responded with enthusiastic applause.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Recently, Japanese friend Hamada Seiei said in Tokyo: "Mao Zedong Thought is not only a treasure for the Chinese people but also for the Japanese and revolutionary people around the world. Mao Zedong Thought will definitely spread widely around the world."

Hamada Seiei is the leader of the Japanese Beijing Radio Listeners' Visit to China Delegation. She pointed out in her recent return to Japan based on her personal experiences during her visit to China: "Mao Zedong Thought is the driving force behind China's socialist revolution and socialist construction."

Another member of the delegation, Takabashi Mitsuo, enthusiastically praised the ongoing Cultural Revolution of the Chinese people. He said that the victory of this revolution will create favorable conditions for the victory of the world revolutionary movement. Takabashi also expressed his determination to "strive for the success of the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival and further strengthen unity with the Chinese people." Another member, Takara Masumi, said that seeing the Cultural Revolution in China truly boosts one's confidence. She said that no matter what difficulties arise, as long as the people unite and persist in the struggle, the revolution will definitely be victorious.

Takara emphasized: "The friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China are a historical tide, and a small group of people cannot stop it."

The friends of this delegation all took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" they carried with them and passionately declared: "In the future, no matter what difficulties and obstacles we encounter, we will seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and strive to spread Mao Zedong Thought among the Japanese people."

    滨田系卫说毛泽东思想一定会传遍全世界
    新华社二日讯　东京消息：日本作曲家、音乐指挥、松山芭蕾舞团访华代表团副团长宗像和，最近满怀崇敬和热爱毛主席的激情为毛主席语录谱曲。
    宗像和为毛主席语录谱了两支曲子，一首是“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”一首是“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这是这位音乐家十月上旬访问延安前后创作的。
    中国国庆节前夕，当宗像和在北京时，中国朋友赠给他一册日文版的《毛主席语录》。他同松山芭蕾舞团全体团员一样，每天学习它，随时把它带在身上。他越学习，对于毛主席的话体会越深。在离开北京去延安的途中，他满怀激情地为毛主席语录谱曲。在创作时，他征求同车的中国红卫兵小将的意见，反复修改，在到达延安前完成了第一支歌曲。延安的中国音乐舞蹈工作者在同松山芭蕾舞团联欢时，表演了这支歌曲。离开延安后不久，宗像在旅途中，又为毛主席语录谱了第二支曲子。
    这两支歌曲创作出来之后，马上成为松山芭蕾舞团团员们最爱唱的歌曲。
    松山芭蕾舞团团长清水正夫说：毛主席教导我们，在困难的时候要看到光明，要有信心。现在日本正处在美日反动派的统治下，最近又有一小撮现代修正主义的追随者兴风作浪，斗争任务很艰巨。但是我们要相信日本人民大众，永远同他们在一起，满怀信心地去争取胜利。清水称赞宗像的创作说：这两支歌曲，既体现出毛主席的教导、表达了对毛主席的热爱，又反映了日本人民的斗争激情。
    二十八日晚，松山芭蕾舞团回到东京时，他们在机场上，拿着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，向欢迎他们的日本各界人士和中国朋友演唱这两支为毛主席语录谱出的新歌曲，欢迎者报以热烈的掌声。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本朋友滨田系卫最近在东京发表谈话说：“毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的宝，也是日本和世界革命人民的宝。毛泽东思想必然会在世界上广泛传布。”
    滨田系卫是日本北京广播听众访华代表团团长。她在最近回到日本后以她在中国访问期间的亲身见闻指出：“毛泽东思想是中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的动力”。
    这个代表团的团员高桥满雄在谈话中热烈赞扬中国人民正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，这场革命的胜利将为世界革命运动的胜利创造有利的条件。高桥还表示要“下定决心，为使第二届中日青年友好大联欢获得成功，并为进一步加强同中国人民的团结而奋斗。”另一位团员高良真水说，看了中国的文化大革命真使人感到信心倍增。她说，不管遇到什么困难，只要人民团结起来坚持斗争，革命就一定会胜利。
    高良强调指出：“日中两国人民的友好团结是历史的洪流，一小撮人想阻挡它是不可能的。”
    这个代表团的朋友们都一起拿出随身携带的《毛主席语录》，慷慨激昂地表示：“今后不管遇到什么困难和阻挠，我们都要认真地学习毛泽东思想，并且要努力地在日本人民当中传播毛泽东思想。”
