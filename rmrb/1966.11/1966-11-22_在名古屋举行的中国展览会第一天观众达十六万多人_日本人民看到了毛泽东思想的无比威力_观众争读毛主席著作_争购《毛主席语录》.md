The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Nagoya, Japan, attracted over 160,000 visitors on its first day of public viewing on November 20, creating an unprecedented spectacle. Visitors enthusiastically praised the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people in socialist revolution and construction under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

From dawn on that day, the roads leading to the exhibition hall were bustling with people. The visitors included not only the broad masses of Nagoya and central Japan but also workers, peasants, and housewives from distant places such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, northern Kyushu, and the northeastern regions. Even when the exhibition hall was brightly lit, visitors continued to pour in.

One visitor wrote in the guestbook: "I deeply felt the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Since Mao Zedong Thought can turn the ideals of Marxism into reality in a country with 700 million people, it will surely guide the people of the world to turn their lofty ideals into reality. Mao Zedong Thought is indeed the highest representative of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

A friend named Hosokawa Katsuyoshi enthusiastically praised the rapid progress of China's self-produced machinery and equipment, noting their unique creativity. He said, "This is the result of following Mao Zedong's teachings, breaking away from foreign frameworks, relying on self-reliance, and walking our own path, while also unleashing the wisdom of the masses."

A leader of a Japanese youth delegation preparing to participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival specially came from Tokyo to visit the exhibition. He told a Chinese reporter, "After seeing the exhibition, I am even more eager to go to China to see this great country with my own eyes and meet the great leader Chairman Mao."

Another visitor wrote: "Mao Zedong Thought is a common treasure of the people of the world. Long live Mao Zedong Thought! The Chinese people and the Japanese people are forever brothers." Yet another visitor wrote: "Go ahead, self-reliant China! Down with American imperialism and modern revisionism! Long live Chairman Mao!"

To meet the visitors' demand for studying Chairman Mao's works, a reading room for Chairman Mao's works was set up in the cultural hall of the exhibition. Throughout the day, people came in a continuous stream to read. During peak times, many people even stood for long periods to read Chairman Mao's various works. An elderly man took a copy of the Japanese version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," carefully flipping through it for over half an hour. Pointing to Chairman Mao's photo, he told a Chinese reporter, "Chairman Mao is truly great." Then he flipped to the page with Lin Biao's inscription and said, "Lin Biao is indeed Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms. His call for the Chinese people to study Chairman Mao's works is a great deed."

In the bookstore at the exhibition hall, the best-selling books were "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and other works by Chairman Mao, as well as the Japanese versions of "Beijing Review" and "People's China," which featured articles introducing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Especially the newly published Japanese version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" was enthusiastically welcomed by the visitors. Many people bought "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."

The films shown in the exhibition hall's cinema, reflecting China's socialist construction and Chairman Mao's reception of the cultural revolution army, were enthusiastically received by the audience. The cinema with over 800 seats was full for every show, with people even standing in the aisles. An elderly woman who watched Chinese films for the first time watched two consecutive shows. She said, "It felt like I had gone to China and met Chairman Mao. Today is the happiest day of my life."

    在名古屋举行的中国展览会第一天观众达十六万多人
    日本人民看到了毛泽东思想的无比威力
    观众争读毛主席著作　争购《毛主席语录》
    新华社二十一日讯　名古屋消息：在日本名古屋市举行的中国经济贸易展览会，在二十日正式接待观众的第一天，就有十六万多人前来参观，出现了空前的盛况。观众们热情称赞中国人民在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下在社会主义革命和建设中取得的巨大成就。
    这一天，从清晨起，在通往会场的几条大马路上，参观展览会的人川流不息。观众中除了名古屋和中部日本地区的广大市民外，还有从东京、京都、大阪、北九州和东北地方远道而来的工人、农民和家庭妇女。直到会场内灯火辉煌的时候，观众仍然络绎不绝，源源而来。
    一位观众参观后在留言簿上写道：“我深刻地感受到毛泽东思想的伟大。毛泽东思想既然可以在拥有七亿人口的大国把马克思主义的理想变为现实，它也一定能够引导世界人民把崇高的理想变成现实。毛泽东思想不愧为当代马克思列宁主义的最高代表。”
    一位名叫细川廓真的朋友热烈称赞展出的中国自己生产的机器设备进步飞快，并具有中国独特的创造。他说：“这是遵照了毛泽东的教导，打破洋框框，自力更生，走自己的道路，并且发挥了人民群众的智慧的结果。”
    一位准备参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的日本青年代表团团长，特地从东京赶来参观。他对中国记者说：“看了展览会，使我更加渴望到中国去，亲眼看一看这个伟大的国家，见一见伟大的领袖毛主席。”
    另一位观众写道：“毛泽东思想是世界人民共同的财富。”“毛泽东思想万岁！中国人民和日本人民永远是兄弟。”还有一位观众写道：“自力更生的中国，加油干！打倒美帝国主义和现代修正主义，毛主席万岁！”
    为了满足观众学习毛主席著作的要求，在展览会的文化馆内设了毛主席著作阅览室，前来阅读的人整天络绎不绝。在读者多的时候，有许多人甚至长时间站着阅读毛主席的各种著作。有一位老人拿起一册日文版《毛主席语录》，专心致志地翻阅了半个多小时，他指着毛主席的照片对中国记者说：“毛主席真伟大。”然后他又翻到印有林彪同志题词的那一页说：“林彪不愧是毛主席的最亲密的战友，他号召中国人民很好地学习毛主席著作，是做了一件伟大的事。”
    在展览馆出售中国书籍的书店里，最畅销的书是《毛主席语录》和毛主席的其它著作以及刊登介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的文章的日文版《北京周报》和《人民中国》，特别是刚出版的《毛主席语录》日文本受到观众热烈的欢迎。许多人都购买了《毛主席语录》。
    展览会电影馆放映的反映中国社会主义建设和毛主席接见文化革命大军的电影，受到观众极热烈的欢迎。有八百多个席位的电影馆，场场满员，连座席旁边的通道也站满了人。有一位第一次看中国电影的老大娘一连看了两场。她说：“我好像去了一次中国，见了毛主席。今天是我一生最高兴的一天。”
