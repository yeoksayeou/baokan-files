The millions of revolutionary people in Latin America are engaged in fierce anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles. They constantly look towards the East, yearning for Chairman Mao. They eagerly study the truth of revolution and liberation—Mao Zedong Thought. They draw inspiration and encouragement from Chairman Mao's works; they clarify their direction and strengthen their resolve. Below are a few stories of their love for Chairman Mao and his works.

A Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire

Once, a friend from Nicaragua who was engaged in armed struggle said, "Under the rule, oppression, and plunder of American imperialism and the Somoza family, Nicaragua has become a 'hell on earth,' with over a million residents living in dire conditions. However, the Nicaraguan people are not willing to live in humiliation. They have taken up arms, entered the mountains, and engaged in a life-and-death struggle against American imperialism and the reactionary dictatorship. He said: "The struggle is arduous. American imperialism and the reactionaries have surrounded us, and revisionists have betrayed us. The environment is extremely perilous. However, whenever we recall Chairman Mao's statement, 'A spark can start a prairie fire,' we gain confidence and boost our morale."

He said that in their ranks, almost everyone has a copy of Chairman Mao's "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "We cherish this work as we do our own lives, because Chairman Mao's book guides us to gain something more precious than life."

Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention

This Nicaraguan soldier also said: In their ranks, everyone wears a badge with "Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention" inscribed on it. They take the People's Liberation Army of China as their example. He said: "It is precisely because the Nicaraguan people have found their guide for revolutionary struggle—Mao Zedong Thought—that we can say a free, independent, and democratic Nicaragua will surely appear in the Western Hemisphere."

An Eternal Sun

This Nicaraguan friend, through his struggles, expressed his heartfelt love and respect for Chairman Mao. He said: "We always look towards the East, towards Beijing where Mao Zedong resides. When we are victorious, we think of Chairman Mao; when we encounter temporary setbacks, we think of Chairman Mao. From Chairman Mao's brilliant words, we gain endless strength and inspiration. Chairman Mao is not only the helmsman of the Chinese people but also the helmsman of the Latin American people. Chairman Mao is the eternal sun in the hearts of the people of all countries in the world."

Carrying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Everywhere

In Peru, guerrilla forces engaged in anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles also use Chairman Mao's works as their weapon for revolution. Many guerrilla leaders carry "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in their backpacks while fighting guerrilla warfare. Whether in days of intense battle or while working among Indian farmers, they often read Chairman Mao's works. A Peruvian friend said: "Latin American revolutionaries have personally experienced that Mao Zedong's theories match the actual situation in Latin America. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the characteristics of China, creatively formulated the theory of revolutionizing the countryside first and then the cities, surrounding the cities from the countryside. Latin American revolutionaries are applying this experience."

To Make a Revolution, One Must Read Chairman Mao's Books

In Brazil, some young people, upon obtaining Chairman Mao's works, treat them as treasures and cannot put them down. A young person, in connection with the political events that have occurred in Brazil over the past two years, repeatedly studies Chairman Mao's works in search of truth. He said: "In April 1964, when Brazil experienced a military coup, because I had not had the opportunity to read Chairman Mao's works at that time, I felt helpless and could not see the direction in the face of the reactionaries' rampant attacks on the people. Now that I can often read Chairman Mao's works, this is my greatest happiness. I realize that Brazilians, especially Brazilian youth, must learn from Chairman Mao's works to make a revolution."

The Revolutionary Struggle Has the Correct Direction

Revolutionaries in Ecuador eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. A group of revolutionaries organized a study group for Mao Zedong's works, linking them to Ecuador's actual situation for study. Due to the scarcity of books, they study by having one person read and explain, followed by group discussions. After studying Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," a member of this study group said: "We analyzed Ecuador's society based on the points in this work by Chairman Mao, which gave our revolutionary struggle the correct direction and put it on the right track."

Breaking Through Obstacles to Spread Mao Zedong Thought

A friend from Haiti told this story: A few years ago, due to the control of American imperialism, Chairman Mao's works were banned from entering this island nation. However, the revolutionary people of Haiti broke through numerous obstacles and found ways to obtain and study Chairman Mao's works. Haitian revolutionary youth printed small booklets of Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On New Democracy," and "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" in English and other languages for wide distribution, allowing more people to read Chairman Mao's works. By 1964, Haitian revolutionaries had translated Chairman Mao's works into the local dialect. Thus, Chairman Mao's works spread among the workers and peasants.

This Haitian friend also shared his experience of studying Chairman Mao's works. He said: "Ten years ago, I began reading my first book by Chairman Mao—'On Protracted War.' Through reading Chairman Mao's works, I embarked on the revolutionary path. Whenever I encounter difficulties in the struggle, I read Chairman Mao's works, and each time I discover new things and find solutions to problems." He excitedly said: "Chairman Mao's works inspire me to strive harder in my work, study, and struggle, and to keep moving forward."

    拉丁美洲人民心向毛主席
    各国革命者如饥似渴地学习毛泽东思想
    拉丁美洲的千百万革命人民，正在进行着如火如荼的反美反独裁斗争。他们时刻注视着东方，向往着毛主席。他们如饥似渴地学习闹革命谋解放的真理——毛泽东思想。他们从毛主席的著作中得到启示，受到激励；明确了方向，坚定了斗志。下面介绍的是他们热爱毛主席和毛主席著作的几则故事。
        星星之火，可以燎原
    有一次，一位正在进行武装斗争的尼加拉瓜朋友说，在美帝国主义和索摩查家族反动的统治、奴役和掠夺下，尼加拉瓜已经成为“人间地狱”，一百多万居民生活在水深火热之中。但是，尼加拉瓜人民不甘心过屈辱的生活，他们拿起武器，进入山林，同美帝国主义和反动独裁政府展开了生死斗争。他说：“斗争是艰巨的，美帝国主义和反动派包围了我们，修正主义者出卖我们，环境十分险恶。但是，每当我们想起毛主席‘星星之火，可以燎原’的论断的时候，我们就增强了信心，鼓起了斗志。”
    他说，在他们的队伍中，几乎每个人都有一本毛主席的《抗日游击战争的战略问题》，“我们就像爱护自己的生命一样爱护这部著作，因为毛主席的书引导我们获得比生命还宝贵的东西。”
      三大纪律，八项注意
    这位尼加拉瓜的战士还说：在他们的队伍中，每个人都佩戴着一个铜章，上面刻着“三大纪律，八项注意”。他们就是这样以中国人民解放军作为自己的榜样。他说：“正是因为尼加拉瓜人民找到了他们革命斗争的指南——毛泽东思想，所以可以说，一个自由、独立和民主的尼加拉瓜必将出现在西半球。”
      永远不落的太阳
    这位尼加拉瓜朋友通过斗争的实践，从内心里发出了对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的感情。他说：“我们每时每刻都注视着东方，注视着毛泽东居住的北京。当我们胜利的时候，我们想起了毛主席；当我们遇到暂时挫折的时候，我们又想起了毛主席。从毛主席的光辉语言中，我们获得了无穷无尽的力量和鼓舞。毛主席不仅是中国人民的舵手，而且也是拉丁美洲人民的舵手，毛主席是全世界各国人民心中永远不落的太阳。”
      随身携带《毛泽东选集》
    在秘鲁，正在进行反美反独裁斗争的游击队，也是以毛主席著作作为他们进行革命的武器。许多游击队领导人在打游击的背包里都带着《毛泽东选集》。不论在战火纷飞的日子，或是在印第安农民当中活动的时候，他们都经常阅读毛主席著作。一位秘鲁朋友说：“拉丁美洲革命者亲身体会到毛主席著作的论述符合拉丁美洲的实际情况。毛泽东同志根据中国的特点，创造性地制定了中国革命先农村后城市，以农村包围城市的理论。拉丁美洲革命者正在应用着这条经验。”
    要革命就要读毛主席的书
    在巴西，一些青年人一得到毛主席著作，就如获至宝，爱不释手。一位青年结合这两年来巴西所发生的政治事件，反复学习毛主席著作，寻求真理。他说：“一九六四年四月，巴西发生军事政变时，因为那时我还没有机会读到毛主席的著作，在反动派向人民猖狂进攻面前，我曾感到没有办法，认不清方向。现在我能够经常读到毛主席著作了，这是我最大的幸福。我认识到，巴西人，特别是巴西青年要搞革命，就得学习毛主席著作。”
    革命斗争有了正确的方向
    厄瓜多尔的革命者如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。一批革命者组织了毛泽东著作学习小组，联系厄瓜多尔的实际进行学习。由于人多书少，他们在学习时，由一个人朗读和讲解，然后大家进行讨论。这个学习小组在学了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》之后，一位学员说：“我们根据毛主席这一著作的论点分析了厄瓜多尔的社会，从而使我们的革命斗争有了正确的方向，走上了正轨。”
  冲破重重障碍，传播毛泽东思想
    一位海地朋友讲述了这样一个故事：几年前，由于美帝国主义的控制，毛主席的著作被禁止进入这个岛国。但是海地革命人民冲破重重障碍，想方设法得到和学习毛主席著作。海地的革命青年把毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《新民主主义论》和《毛泽东军事文选》等著作的英文和其他文种的版本油印成小册子，广为散发，使更多的人读到了毛主席著作。到了一九六四年，海地的革命者又把毛主席著作译成当地土语。这样，毛主席著作便在工农群众中传播了。
    这位海地朋友还谈了他自己学习毛主席著作的体会。他说：“十年前我开始读第一本毛主席著作——《论持久战》。由于阅读毛主席著作，使我走上了革命的道路。每当在斗争中遇到困难时，我便阅读毛主席著作，每读一次都发现新的东西，找到解决问题的途径。”他激动地说：“毛主席著作鼓舞我在工作、学习、斗争中加倍地努力，不断前进。”
