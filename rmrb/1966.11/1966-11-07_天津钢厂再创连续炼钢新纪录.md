The workers of the first steelmaking division of Tianjin Steel Plant have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking through the obstacles posed by bourgeois technical "authorities." Following their achievement in January of last year, when they set a record of 2,289 consecutive smelts in a medium-sized open-hearth furnace, they have now, by October 12 of this year, achieved a new feat of 2,454 consecutive smelts in the No. 2 open-hearth furnace using domestically developed high-density magnesia-alumina bricks.

The quality of the steel has also improved compared to the past.

    天津钢厂再创连续炼钢新纪录
    天津钢厂第一炼钢分厂职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打破资产阶级技术“权威”的阻挠，继去年一月创造中型平炉顶连续冶炼二千二百八十九炉钢的纪录之后，到今年十月十二日止，在二号平炉上用我国独创的高密度镁铝砖，再创中型平炉顶连续冶炼二千四百五十四炉钢的新成就。
    钢的质量也比过去有所提高。
