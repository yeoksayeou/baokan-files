	Heartily Congratulate the Glorious Festival of the Albanian People

	The heroic people of Albania have become a great beacon of socialism in Europe.

	Today marks the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation. The Chinese people, with hearts full of excitement, join with the fraternal Albanian people in enthusiastically celebrating the glorious festival of the Albanian people and in enthusiastically hailing the great achievements of the Albanian people in the construction of socialism.

	The Albanian people are a heroic people with a glorious fighting tradition. For hundreds of years, they have fought bravely and unyieldingly against foreign invaders to win freedom and independence. During the Second World War, they were again subjected to the occupation of the fascist bandits. The indomitable Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, waged a resolute struggle against the fascist occupiers and traitors, fighting bravely and tenaciously, fearing no sacrifice, and finally drove out the German-Italian fascist bandits on November 29, 1944, liberating their own country. From then on, the Albanian people became masters of their own country and hoisted the red flag of socialism high on the shores of the Adriatic Sea.

	The Albanian Labor Party is a revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism. The hardworking and courageous Albanian people, under its leadership, have, despite the encirclement by imperialism and modern revisionism, taken up the hoe in one hand and the gun in the other, relying on their own efforts, and striven to build socialism with great vigor, achieving brilliant and splendid results. The Albanian people have successfully completed three five-year plans, transforming Albania, which was economically backward before liberation, into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. Now, the Albanian people are advancing with high spirits and unwavering confidence to strive for the realization of the fourth five-year plan.

	The heroic Albanian people resolutely oppose imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries, resolutely oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations. Heroic Albania has become a staunch red guard in the struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and in support of the world revolution.

	The heroic spirit of the Albanian people, who build while fighting, and their fearless spirit of daring to fight against all enemies in the world, have won the admiration and praise of revolutionary people all over the world.

	Chairman Mao said: "The heroic people of Albania have become a great beacon of socialism in Europe.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership, the Titoist clique in Yugoslavia, and all kinds of traitorous and scab cliques are, compared with you, merely a handful of dust, while you are mountains that tower into the sky."

	The Chinese people feel greatly honored and proud to have the Albanian people as their most intimate comrades-in-arms. The fraternal friendship forged between our two peoples in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism is deeper than the Adriatic Sea and higher than the Himalayas. It has withstood the test of storms and tempests and is indestructible by any force. We will forever stand shoulder to shoulder, fighting to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and striving to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation.

    热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民的光辉节日
    英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚解放二十二周年。中国人民怀着无比兴奋的心情，同兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一道，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民的光辉节日，热烈欢呼阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设社会主义事业中取得的伟大成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是具有光荣战斗传统的英雄的人民。他们为反抗外国侵略者，争取自由和独立，前赴后继地斗争了几百年。在第二次世界大战期间，又遭到了法西斯强盗的占领。不屈的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，同法西斯占领者和卖国贼进行了坚决的斗争，英勇顽强，不怕牺牲，终于在一九四四年十一月二十九日赶走了德意法西斯强盗，解放了自己的国家。从此，阿尔巴尼亚人民自己当家作主，在亚得里亚海边高高升起了社会主义的红旗。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是用马克思列宁主义武装起来的革命的党。勤劳勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在它的领导下，不顾帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，自力更生，奋发图强，在建设社会主义的道路上突飞猛进，取得了辉煌灿烂的成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民已经胜利地完成了三个五年计划，把解放前经济十分落后的阿尔巴尼亚建设成了具有现代工业、集体农业的先进的社会主义国家。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在意气风发，信心百倍地为实现第四个五年计划而奋斗。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派，坚决反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，坚决支持英雄的越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，已经成为反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义，支持世界革命的一支坚强的红色突击队。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民一面建设，一面战斗的英雄气概，他们敢于同世界上一切暴敌斗争的大无畏精神，博得了全世界革命人民的敬佩和赞扬。
    毛主席说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。
    苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。”
    中国人民为有阿尔巴尼亚人民作为自己最亲密的战友感到无比的光荣和自豪。我们两国人民在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中建立的战斗友谊，比亚得里亚海还深，比喜马拉雅山还高，它经历过急风暴雨的考验，是任何力量也破坏不了的。我们将永远并肩携手，为打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗到底。
