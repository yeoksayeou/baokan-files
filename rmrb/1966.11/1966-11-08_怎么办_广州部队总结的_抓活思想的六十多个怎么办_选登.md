Editor's Note: A certain regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region has summarized over 60 "how to handle it" methods based on the experiences of the masses to address common issues in the political thought work of the platoons. Under the guidance of Comrade Lin Biao, after further promotion, application, and investigation by the leadership of the Guangzhou Military Region at the grassroots level, these methods have been enriched and improved. Their method of summarizing experiences and the experiences they have summarized are of universal significance and are worth learning and promoting.

The following is a selection from the over 60 "how to handle it" methods.

How to Make "The Three Articles" Fresh and New

Some soldiers reflect that studying the three articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Moving Mountains" can be challenging to keep fresh and new, to study repeatedly and deeply, and to effectively transform one's worldview.

A certain regiment's 1st Battalion Machine Gun Company and 2nd and 3rd Battalions Artillery Companies have effectively solved this problem. They repeatedly study and frequently use "The Three Articles," making them fresh and new each time. Their experience is as follows:

First, they educate soldiers to clearly understand that "The Three Articles" teach us to establish a worldview of serving the people of China and the world wholeheartedly. Therefore, it is the fundamental course that every revolutionary soldier must take. We should study it for life, use it for life, and dedicate our lives to revolution and studying "The Three Articles." At the same time, they inspire soldiers to use the standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to examine their own shortcomings, criticize the complacency of thinking that "'The Three Articles' have been studied well," and make them consciously correct their learning attitudes. In terms of study methods, they pay attention to the following points:

1. Each study of "The Three Articles" proposes a new requirement. The 1st Battalion Machine Gun Company, in 1965, based on the situation, tasks, party policies, and the actual thoughts of the company, organized multiple studies of "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Each study proposed a new requirement. The first time, some soldiers had difficulties accepting the extension of their service period, so they were asked to study Bethune's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people of the world. The second time, during the education on the abolition of military ranks and the reform of soldiers' allowances, they were asked to compare themselves with Bethune's selfless spirit. The third time, during the education on war preparedness, they were asked to study Bethune's internationalist spirit and prepare their minds for supporting Vietnam against America. Each study of "In Memory of Norman Bethune" deepens one viewpoint, solves one problem, and raises one's understanding.

2. Study "The Three Articles" in conjunction with Chairman Mao's new instructions. Last December, they saw Chairman Mao's inscription for the 20th anniversary of the founding of China's radio broadcasting: "Strive to build a good radio station to serve the people of the whole of China and the world." They immediately organized soldiers to study this in conjunction with "Serve the People," further strengthening their resolve to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end.

3. Use a fundamental viewpoint to solve multiple new problems. The 3rd Battalion Artillery Company last year used the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people to solve problems such as some soldiers' concerns about the extension of their service period, family difficulties, and the resolution of personal marriages during several institutional reforms; during the socialist education, they solved the concerns of a few people who feared that confessing their problems would affect their personal progress; during tense situations, they solved the thought problems of some old soldiers who missed home. In this way, each study brings a new harvest.

4. Study "The Three Articles" and seize new opportunities. The 3rd Battalion Artillery Company, during a field training exercise, marched for ten hours without food. The soldiers were hungry and tired, and they had to climb two large mountains. The path was narrow and steep, and some comrades developed a sense of difficulty. The company seized the opportunity to organize everyone to study "Moving Mountains," proposing: "First, learn from Yu Gong who is not afraid of difficulties; ten thousand-foot-high mountains are just trivial; second, learn from Yu Gong who is not afraid of hardship, sacrificing oneself for the public good; third, learn from Yu Gong who has great aspirations, no matter how great the difficulty, he does not bow his head; fourth, learn from Yu Gong who has perseverance, and will not retreat until he overcomes the difficulties." Everyone was inspired, and with one breath, they climbed over the high mountains. The soldiers said, "This kind of study is like sending water when we are thirsty and sending food when we are hungry."

5. Study "The Three Articles" and widely use new materials. Each time they study, they pay attention to using new auxiliary materials to explain the fundamental viewpoints. For example, when studying the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people, sometimes they tell the revolutionary traditions of our party and army, sometimes they explain the "Anthology of Revolutionary Martyrs' Poems," "Diary of Lei Feng," "Diary of Wang Jie," sometimes they quote advanced deeds published in newspapers, sometimes they publicize good people and good deeds in the company. Through these vivid living materials, they help soldiers understand the fundamental viewpoints.

6. Study "The Three Articles" and can also use some auxiliary methods. For example: holding a sharing meeting, where soldiers share their experiences of studying "The Three Articles"; going to Lu Shengjiao Park to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune"; at the martyrs' graves, lecturing on "Serve the People"; in conjunction with the study of "The Three Articles," inviting old leaders to share stories of wholeheartedly serving the people, fighting bravely, and fearlessly sacrificing; exhibiting notes on the study of "The Three Articles," etc.

What to Do When Feeling "No Questions to Bring" While Studying Chairman Mao's Works

Some soldiers often feel "no questions to bring" while studying Chairman Mao's works. Some say, "There are 365 days in a year. If you read Chairman Mao's books every day and bring a question every day, where can you find so many questions?" Some say, "My thoughts are simple, I don't have personalism, the party tells me to do something, and I do it. What questions can I bring?" The main reasons are: first, there is a one-sided understanding of what constitutes a "question," thinking that a "question" is only a flaw or mistake, and if there are no flaws or mistakes, there are no questions to bring. Second, the standard for self-reform is not high, the requirements are not strict, and one cannot constantly examine oneself to find weak points, being satisfied with "no questions." Third, the integration of learning and practice is not good, and not enough effort is put into the "use" aspect.

How to help these soldiers bring questions to study?

1. Help everyone understand what a "question" is. Use the soldiers' personal experiences to explain that no matter who, when, or what, there will always be "questions." Not only when there are "knots" in one's thoughts, difficulties in work, and the emergence of flaws and mistakes, are they "questions"; but also, how to correctly understand the domestic and international class struggle situation, how to implement the party's line and policies, how to learn from heroes and models like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, how to correctly handle personal future, honor, marriage, and how to use Chairman Mao's viewpoints to summarize work experience, etc., are all "questions." When studying Chairman Mao's works, one should bring questions about personal work, thoughts, life, and style, as well as major events in the army, the country, and the world. One should bring questions about flaws and mistakes, as well as questions about achievements and experiences. Everyone understands this logic and will feel that there are questions to bring at any time and place.

2. Inspire soldiers to use high standards to examine themselves and find questions. Use Chairman Mao's teachings to examine oneself, see if one is "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people; use the party and higher-level requirements to examine oneself, see if one's thoughts are conscious and actions are decisive in executing the party's instructions and responding to the party and higher-level calls; use advanced individuals to examine oneself, compare thoughts, compare efforts, compare contributions; use the strengths of comrades around oneself to examine oneself, "use others' strengths to compare with one's weaknesses." In this way, everyone can easily find gaps and will not feel that there are no questions to bring.

3. Help soldiers use the dialectical method to constantly find questions consciously. For example, when there are achievements in work, actively find weak points; when one is praised, examine existing flaws; when others are praised, find one's own gaps; when one is criticized, dare to face flaws; when others are criticized, learn from their mistakes; when old questions are solved, see the possibility of new questions arising. Through party and league life, "one helps one, one red pair," and four-good competitions, conduct mutual assistance in thoughts, making each soldier constantly see their good aspects and existing problems.

4. Guide soldiers to think of questions while reading. See how Chairman Mao says it, how one thinks, how one does it, and do it "according to Chairman Mao's teachings to find questions."

5. The party branch, based on the situation, tasks, and the thought situation of the company, regularly proposes some common questions. Major changes in domestic and international situations, major policies and guidelines issued by the party and the state, changes in army tasks, harsh environments, four-good and five-good competitions, old soldiers retiring, new soldiers enlisting, organizational adjustments, promotions, job transfers, etc. When encountering these situations, timely remind questions, guide soldiers to connect with their actual thoughts, and bring questions to study Chairman Mao's works.

6. Help and guide soldiers to work hard on the "use" aspect. Repeatedly publicize the important significance of Comrade Lin Biao's instructions such as "treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all our army's work" and "work hard on the 'use' aspect." Prepare and hold study and sharing meetings on Chairman Mao's works, where comrades who actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works share their experiences, conduct inspiration and guidance. Regularly praise comrades who strictly demand themselves, dare to examine their thoughts, and are good at bringing questions to study, setting examples for everyone. Through these methods, inspire soldiers to consciously bring questions to study repeatedly, use repeatedly, learn while using, and use while learning.

How to Improve the Effectiveness of Daily Reading

Ensuring that the company's daily reading of Chairman Mao's works is effective is a common wish of all cadres and soldiers and an important method for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, addressing active thoughts, and improving the political awareness of the troops. However, some companies do not pay enough attention to daily reading, organize it poorly, and achieve little effect. The main problems are: (1) Lack of planning and preparation, just pick up an article and read when the time comes; or temporarily "delegate" it to the platoons to read, forming a free-for-all. (2) Reading from the book, with little explanation, daily reading becomes "daily recitation," seemingly reading and listening, but actually not understanding well. (3) When connecting with actual thoughts, there is more criticism and less praise.

Improving the effectiveness of daily reading is key to the party branch and cadres paying great attention to it, treating daily reading as an important aspect of emphasizing politics, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and addressing active thoughts, and strengthening leadership. At the same time, pay attention to improving the methods of daily reading.

1. Plan well. Generally, plan once a week or two weeks. Based on the situation, tasks, and the actual thoughts of the company, propose what problems to bring to study, which article or which quotations to study, and what viewpoints to focus on. When to give a lecture, when to read in groups or discuss, and when to study individually, all should be specifically arranged. After the plan is made, publish it on a blackboard newspaper or a big-character poster, so that the soldiers have a preparation. If there are sudden outstanding problems, the original plan can be changed, and the learning content can be selected according to the current active thoughts.

2. Diversify forms. Sometimes use the method of dispersing time and connecting content, studying an article in one or two weeks, sometimes studying one or two quotations at a time, solving one problem. In terms of organizational forms, sometimes the whole company reads, sometimes the platoons read, sometimes the "red pairs" read, sometimes individuals read. For problems that the whole company shares, the company should organize unified learning. For platoon or individual learning, the leadership should also make arrangements, reminding what problems to bring and what viewpoints to study. For platoons with many problems and weak cadres, cadres should provide specific help.

3. Make explanations vivid. When explaining an article, a viewpoint, or a quotation, use more living materials to make the viewpoint specific and vivid. Soldiers love to hear living materials such as Chairman Mao's great examples of revolutionary practice, the traditional stories of our party and army, the deeds of revolutionary heroes, the anthology of revolutionary martyrs' poems, revolutionary literary works, news from newspapers, good people and good deeds in the unit, etc. Using these living materials is to help soldiers understand Chairman Mao's viewpoints, so the living materials should be selected, and not too many should be explained at once.

4. Persist in positive education. When connecting with actual thoughts, it is best to use the method of positive and negative comparison, explaining what is in accordance with Chairman Mao's viewpoints and what is not, inspiring soldiers to draw a clear line between right and wrong, and not always criticizing. During discussions, first guide soldiers to fully understand Chairman Mao's viewpoints, and not always make self-examinations. For example, when studying "Serve the People," help everyone focus on understanding: why must revolutionary soldiers "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people? How can one achieve wholeheartedly serving the revolution and everything for the revolution? On the basis of improving understanding, guide everyone to share their experiences, share their insights, and consciously examine and compare themselves.

5. The party branch should organize cadres to study one step ahead and study well. Regularly participate in the soldiers' daily reading. Cadres should take the lead in putting themselves "into the picture," sharing their views, thoughts, and insights, and answering the soldiers' difficult questions, guiding soldiers to improve their study methods.

6. Daily reading of Chairman Mao's works and daily reading of newspapers can be appropriately interspersed. In general, use the method of reading Chairman Mao's works one day and reading newspapers the next day.

How to Use Living Materials to Educate Soldiers on Class Struggles

Young soldiers, born under the red flag and growing up in sweet water, have not personally experienced the pain of class exploitation and oppression in the old society, and lack sensory knowledge of class struggles. When the company conducts class education for them, in addition to focusing on the study of Chairman Mao's works, they should also be good at using various living materials for living education. If living materials are used well, the education will be vivid and concrete, the effect will be great, and it can also promote the normalization of class education.

Class education materials are everywhere, and the methods can be diverse. For example: (1) Mobilize soldiers to ask about their family history, write their family history, establish "blood debt accounts" and "liberation accounts," organize recollections of bitterness and sweetness, so that soldiers know the bitterness of the past and the sweetness of today; (2) Display letters about family history and real class struggles, with the soldiers' consent, and make them available for soldiers to read; (3) Fully utilize the class struggle materials published in newspapers, such as international and domestic class struggle information, columns like "Never Forget Class Bitterness, Remember Blood Debts," and "Crimes of the American Empire in South Vietnam," etc., to regularly educate soldiers; (4) Organize soldiers to visit factories and rural areas to ask about hardships, invite old workers and old poor peasants to talk about class struggle history; (5) Go to places where socialist education movements are underway, invite work teams to introduce situations, participate in mass struggle meetings, and visit socialist education movement exhibitions; (6) Invite cadres who participate in local socialist education movements to give reports, or ask them to provide materials for the company's education; (7) During field training, when passing by martyrs' monuments, martyrs' cemeteries, and martyrs' accident sites, seize the opportunity to visit, organize on-site discussions, learn about the deeds of revolutionary martyrs, and understand the brutal crimes of class enemies; (8) Invite soldiers who visit home and family members who come to the unit to introduce the real class struggle situation in their hometowns; (9) Organize soldiers to read books that expose the crimes of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, watch movies, dramas, and novels about class struggles, and encourage everyone to share their thoughts and insights, etc.

How to Use Living Materials Well?

1. The purpose must be clear. When using living materials for class education, consider in advance what recognition and thought problems to solve in the company. Each activity should achieve an educational effect. Do not pursue form and go through the motions.

2. Prepare well. When visiting a place, what to see and what to listen to should be selected in advance. When inviting someone to give a report, requirements should be proposed; when inviting peasants or family members who come to the unit to give a report, help the reporter select and organize materials in advance. When visiting martyrs' monuments or memorials, first understand the martyrs' life stories and give a brief introduction to the troops.

3. Use Chairman Mao's viewpoints to guide living materials. Before visiting or giving a report, based on the problems to be solved, study one or two quotations from Chairman Mao, educate everyone to use Chairman Mao's viewpoints as weapons to see, listen, and ask. After visiting or listening to a report, seriously study the relevant works of Chairman Mao, organize discussions, guide everyone to use Chairman Mao's viewpoints to specifically analyze the materials seen and heard. And use the method of combining leadership and masses to summarize well, helping everyone to raise their sensory knowledge to rational knowledge.

4. Pay attention to understanding the effect. After organizing an activity, find out which problems have been solved, which problems have not been solved, and what new problems have emerged, and then use various methods to continue education.

5. The fundamental purpose of using living materials for class education is to improve soldiers' class consciousness. Therefore, in education, pay attention to inspiring soldiers to understand what is class, what is exploitation, what is class struggle; understand how the three great enemies cruelly exploit the Chinese people; understand that in a socialist society, class struggle has new characteristics; especially guide soldiers to connect domestic class struggle with international class struggle, deeply hate American imperialism, various reactionaries, and modern revisionism, deeply sympathize with the oppressed people of the world, and establish a world revolutionary ideology.

How to Deepen Soldiers' Class Hatred Towards American Imperialism

The process of soldier Huang Qibiao's understanding of American imperialism can well illustrate this problem.

He said: Before I enlisted, I only knew that landlords and the Kuomintang oppressed and exploited the people, and I also heard about the Japanese devils killing and setting fires. My fifth uncle was killed by Japanese bandits, so I have hated them since I was young. I also knew that American imperialism was bad, but I rarely heard about its crimes.

In early 1964, after joining the army, I participated in the recollection of bitterness education. Many comrades denounced the crimes of landlords and the Kuomintang in the old society, and the company invited a returned overseas Chinese to denounce the crimes of American imperialism. Then, we studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." The political instructor guided us to trace the root cause, making me understand that in the old society, the reason for suffering was because of the exploitation of landlords; while the landlords' backer was Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek relied on his American godfather. This time, I connected my suffering with the aggressive crimes of American imperialism, making me understand that American imperialism, landlords, capitalists, the Kuomintang, and Japanese invaders are all the same, all equally bad.

However, what specific bad things has American imperialism done? I still didn't know much. This problem was solved through the company's frequent organization of "settling old accounts and talking about new grievances" activities. The political instructor often organized us to study Chairman Mao's "Abolish Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," "Friendship or Aggression?" and other articles, told us about the history of American aggression against China, and read "American Imperialism is the Enemy of the Chinese People," making me know that this bad guy started invading our country more than a hundred years ago, and its blood debt is truly countless. In the past, I thought it had done some good deeds, but in fact, it set up factories and mines in China to directly exploit us; it set up schools and churches to cultivate running dogs and numb the revolutionary will of the Chinese people; it set up orphanages and killed many Chinese children; it set up hospitals and used Chinese people for experiments. In this way, it peeled off its "charitable" skin layer by layer, and we saw that it was at odds with the Chinese people everywhere. After liberation, it was unwilling to give up and launched the Korean War, trying to follow the old path of Japanese aggression against China; it occupied our Taiwan and supported the Kuomintang bandits to invade the mainland; it directly sent planes and warships to invade our airspace and territorial waters, attempting to return to power and ride on the heads of our people again. From the past to the present, it has always been the mortal enemy of the Chinese people.

In the past, I often wondered in my heart: is it because American imperialism has a grudge against China that it deliberately picks on us? My incorrect idea was corrected through the leadership's lectures on the crimes of American imperialism around the world, guiding us to compare our past sufferings with the sufferings of the oppressed people of various countries today, and we finally had the correct understanding. The company often talks about current affairs and reads newspapers, and every day it talks about American imperialism oppressing and exploiting people at home, plundering wealth, killing people, and suppressing revolutionary movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, making me realize that American imperialism not only opposes China but also opposes all the people of the world. It is the common enemy of all the people of the world. Especially after reading "Letters from the South" and watching movies about American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, I hated American imperialism even more.

In the past, I didn't understand why American imperialism was so bad. Later, the political instructor used the method of class analysis to tell us that the American government is the representative of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, and also revealed its current "crew": President Johnson is a big farmer, and the Secretary of Defense is a manager of a car company. These guys make money by exploiting, invading, and war. They are the vampires of the American people and also the big landlords and big capitalists riding on the heads of the people of the world. If they do not exploit people and oppress people, they cannot live for a day. Understanding the class nature of American imperialism, I hated it even more. Whenever I think of American imperialism still committing arson and evil deeds around the world, and that there are still millions of people living in water and fire in the world, old and new grievances surge up in my heart. On the training ground, when stabbing and shooting, it feels like stabbing Johnson and aiming at American ghosts. My training spirit comes up. I am ready to go to the battlefield at any time, annihilate American imperialism, avenge the Chinese people, and avenge the people of the world!

From this soldier's thought transformation process, it can be seen that to deepen soldiers' class hatred towards American imperialism, the following points should be achieved:

1. Trace the root cause and find the culprit. Seriously do a good job in the recollection of bitterness education for new soldiers, inspire soldiers to dig out the root cause of bitterness, find the culprit. Clearly recognize that American imperialism is the backer of landlords and the Kuomintang, the total root of all the sufferings of the Chinese people. In this way, everyone's class hatred is concentrated on American imperialism.

2. Settle old accounts and record new grievances. In various forms, tell the soldiers about the crimes of American imperialism's aggression against China over the past hundred years. And through frequently talking about the situation and learning current affairs, guide everyone to recall the crimes committed by American imperialism in the past, look at the aggressive activities of American imperialism today, and think about the future aggressive tendencies of American imperialism. Especially explain clearly that American imperialism has shifted the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy to Asia, regarding our country, which insists on Marxism-Leninism, opposes the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism, and aids the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed classes and nations of the world, as its main enemy, actively preparing to launch an aggressive war against our country, to continuously deepen the hatred towards American imperialism.

3. Expose the old bottom and see the ambition. Through the study of Chairman Mao's discussions on the nature of imperialism, guide everyone to use the weapon of class analysis to clearly recognize that American imperialism's exploitation, plunder, aggression, and war are determined by its class nature. Its ambition to enslave the people of the world will not change, and it should not have any illusions about it.

4. Establish a great ambition and annihilate American imperialism. Inspire everyone to remember the class hatred towards American imperialism in their hearts, carve it on the tip of the bayonet, and put it into action, be ready for battle at any time, and vow to annihilate American imperialism, fight for a new world.

    怎么办
    ——广州部队总结的“抓活思想的六十多个怎么办”选登
    编者按：广州部队某团，用总结群众经验的方法，概括出了抓活思想的六十多个“怎么办”，解决了连队政治思想工作中一大批经常遇到的问题。在林彪同志倡导下，经过广州部队领导机关进一步在基层推广、运用和调查研究，又得到了充实和提高。他们这种总结经验的方法，以及他们总结出来的经验，都是有普遍意义的，值得学习和推广。
    这里所选载的，是六十多个“怎么办”中的一部分。
    怎样使“老三篇”常学常新
    有些战士反映：学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇文章，怎样才能做到常读、常新，逐步深入地反复学习，有效地改造世界观。
    某部一营机枪连和二、三营炮兵连，较好地解决了这个问题。他们对“老三篇”反复学，经常用，做到常学常新。他们的经验，首先是教育战士明确认识：“老三篇”教导我们树立全心全意为中国和世界人民服务的世界观，教导我们立下改造中国、改造世界的雄心壮志。因此，它是每个革命战士最根本的必修课。要学到老，用到老，干一辈子革命，学一辈子“老三篇”。同时，启发战士用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务作“尺子”，检查自己存在的差距，批判那种认为“‘老三篇’已经学好了”的自满情绪，使他们自觉地端正学习态度。在学习方法上，他们注意了以下几点：
    一、学一次“老三篇”，提出一次新要求。一营机枪连在一九六五年内，根据形势任务、党的政策和连队的现实思想，多次组织学习《纪念白求恩》，每次学习都提出新的要求。第一次，有的战士对延长服役期限想不通，就要求大家学习白求恩全心全意为世界人民服务的精神。第二次，取消军衔和改革战士津贴标准教育时，要求大家以白求恩毫不利己专门利人的精神对照自己。第三次，进行战备思想教育时，要求大家学习白求恩的国际主义精神，作好援越抗美的思想准备。每学一次《纪念白求恩》，吃透一个观点，解决一个问题，提高一步认识。
    二、学习“老三篇”，结合学习毛主席的新指示。去年十二月，他们看到毛主席为中国人民广播事业创建二十周年题词：“努力办好广播，为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”，立即结合《为人民服务》一文，组织战士学习。使大家进一步增强把中国革命和世界革命进行到底的决心。
    三、用一个基本观点，解决若干新问题。三营炮连去年运用全心全意为人民服务这个观点，在几项制度改革时，解决部分战士担心延长服役期，家庭困难和个人婚姻不好解决的问题；在社会主义教育中，解决少数人怕交代了问题影响个人进步的顾虑；在形势紧张时，解决一些老战士因想探家引起的思想问题。这样，每学一次就有一次新的收获。
    四、学习“老三篇”，善于抓住新时机。三营炮连在一次野营中，连续行军十小时没有吃饭，战士们又饿又累，这时要爬两座大山，路窄坡陡，有的同志产生了畏难情绪。连里抓住时机，组织大家学习《愚公移山》，提出：“一学愚公不怕难，万丈高山只等闲；二学愚公不怕苦，舍己为公把马扶；三学愚公有志气，困难再大头不低；四学愚公有恒心，不战胜困难不收兵。”大家受到鼓舞，一鼓作气爬过高山。战士们说：“这样学习，真像最渴的时候送来了水，最饿的时候送来了粮食。”
    五、学习“老三篇”，广泛运用新材料。他们每次学习，都注意运用新的辅助材料，来说明基本观点。如学习全心全意为人民服务的观点，有时讲述我党我军的革命传统，有时讲解《革命烈士诗抄》、《雷锋日记》、《王杰日记》，有时引用报纸登载的先进事迹，有时宣传连队的好人好事。通过这些生动的活材料，帮助战士领会基本观点。
    六、学习“老三篇”，还可以采用一些辅助的办法。如：召开讲用会，由战士讲学习“老三篇”的体会；到罗盛教公园学习《纪念白求恩》；在烈士墓前讲《为人民服务》；配合学习“老三篇”，请老首长讲全心全意为人民服务、英勇奋斗、不怕牺牲的英雄故事；展览学习“老三篇”的心得笔记；等等。
    学习毛主席著作感到“没有问题可带”怎么办
    有些战士在学习毛主席著作中，常常感到“没有问题可带”。有的说：“一年三百六十五天，天天读毛主席的书，天天要带问题，哪有这么多问题！”有的说：“自己思想单纯，不闹个人主义，党叫干啥就干啥，还有什么问题可带？”主要原因：一是对什么是“问题”，存在片面的理解，以为“问题”就是缺点和错误，“没有缺点错误就没有问题可带”。二是思想改造标准不高，要求不严，不能时时刻刻对自己一分为二，找出薄弱环节，满足于“没有问题”。三是学用结合不好，在“用”字上下功夫不够。
    怎样帮助这些战士带着问题学？
    一、帮助大家认识什么是“问题”。用战士的切身体会，说明不论任何人，任何时候，做任何事情，都会有“问题”。不仅思想有了“疙瘩”，工作遇到困难，产生了缺点错误，是“问题”；而且，怎样认清国内外阶级斗争的形势，怎样贯彻执行党的路线政策，怎样向雷锋、王杰等英雄模范人物学习，怎样正确处理个人前途、荣誉、婚姻，怎样运用毛主席的观点总结工作经验，等等，也都是“问题”。学习毛主席著作的时候，既要带个人工作、思想、生活和作风等方面的问题来学，又要带全军、全国、全世界的大事来学。既要带缺点、错误方面的问题来学，又要带成绩、经验方面的问题来学。大家懂得这个道理，就会感到随时随地都有问题可带。
    二、启发战士用高标准对照自己，发现问题。用毛主席的教导对照自己，看是否“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务；用党和上级的要求对照自己，看执行党的指示，响应党和上级的号召，思想是否自觉，行动是否坚决；用先进人物对照自己，比思想，比干劲，比贡献；用周围同志的长处对照自己，“以人之长，比己之短”。这样一对照，一比较，大家就很容易找出差距，不会感到没有问题可带了。
    三、帮助战士运用一分为二的观点，经常自觉地找问题。例如，工作有了成绩，努力找薄弱环节；自己受了表扬，检查存在的缺点；别人受到表扬，找自己的差距；自己受了批评，敢于正视缺点；别人受了批评，自己吸取教训；老问题解决了，又看到可能产生新的问题。通过党团生活、“一帮一、一对红”、四好评比等活动，进行思想互助，使每个战士经常看到自己好的方面，又看到存在的问题。
    四、引导战士一边读书，一边联想问题。看毛主席怎样说的，自己是怎样想的，怎样做的，做到“按照毛主席的教导去找问题”。
    五、党支部根据形势、任务和连队的思想情况，经常提出一些共同性的问题。国内外形势发生重大变化，党和国家颁布重大的方针、政策，部队任务变动，环境艰苦，评比四好、五好，老战士退役，新战士入伍，调整组织，职务提升，工作调动，等等。碰到这些情况，及时提示问题，引导战士联系自己的思想实际，带着问题去学习毛主席著作。
    六、帮助和指导战士在“用”字上狠下功夫。反复宣传林彪同志“把毛主席的书当作我们全军各项工作的最高指示”、“在‘用’字上狠下功夫”等指示的重大意义。有准备地召开学习毛主席著作讲用会和经验交流会，由活学活用好的同志，介绍学习经验，进行启发和引导。经常表扬严格要求自己，敢于检查思想，善于带着问题学的同志，给大家树立榜样。通过这些办法，启发战士自觉地带着问题反复学，反复用，学中用，用中学。
    怎样提高天天读的效果
    搞好连队学习毛主席著作的天天读，是广大干部战士的共同愿望，是活学活用毛主席著作，抓活的思想，提高部队政治觉悟的一个重要办法。但是，有些连队对天天读重视不够，组织不好，效果不大。主要问题是：（1）没有计划，缺乏准备，一到时间，抓起文章就读；或者临时“下放”到班排去读，形成自流。（2）照本宣读，很少作解释，天天读变成“天天念”，看起来也读了，也听了，实际上没有很好理解。（3）联系思想实际时，批评多，表扬少。
    提高天天读的效果，关键在于党支部和干部要十分重视，把天天读看作是突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，抓好活思想的重要方面，切实加强领导。同时，注意改进天天读的方法。
    一、搞好计划。一般情况下，一周或两周订一次计划。根据形势、任务和连队的现实思想，提出带什么问题学，学哪一篇文章或哪几条语录，着重领会什么观点。什么时候讲课，什么时候分班阅读或者讨论，什么时候个人自学，都做出具体安排。计划订出后，用黑板报或大字报公布出去，让战士们有个准备。遇到临时发生的突出问题，可以改变原订计划，根据当时的活思想，另选学习内容。
    二、形式多样。有时采取时间分散、内容联贯的办法，在一、两周内学习一篇文章，有时一次学习一、两条语录，解决一个问题。在组织形式上，有时全连读，有时分班读，有时“一对红”对子读，有时个人读。凡是解决全连共同性的问题，就由连里统一组织学习。分班学或个人学，领导上也要有布置，提示带什么问题，学什么观点。对问题多、骨干弱的班，干部要具体帮助。
    三、讲解生动。讲一篇文章，一个观点，一条语录，多运用活的材料，把观点讲得具体生动。战士最爱听的活材料有：毛主席革命实践的伟大榜样，我党我军的传统故事，革命英雄人物事迹，革命烈士诗抄，革命文艺作品，报纸上的时事新闻，本单位的好人好事，等等。运用这些活材料，目的是帮助战士领会毛主席的观点，因此，活材料要有选择，一次不能讲得太多。
    四、坚持正面教育。联系思想实际，最好用正反对比的方法，讲清怎样就符合毛主席的观点，怎样就不符合毛主席的观点，启发战士划清是非界限，不要总是批评。讨论时，首先引导战士吃透毛主席的观点，不要总是作检讨。譬如学习《为人民服务》，就帮助大家着重弄清：革命战士为什么必须“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务？怎样才能做到一心为革命、一切为革命？在提高认识的基础上，再引导大家谈心得，谈体会，自觉地对照检查。
    五、支部要组织干部先学一步，学好一点。经常参加战士天天读。干部要带头把自己“摆进去”，谈看法，摆思想，谈体会，并解答战士提出的疑难问题，指导战士改进学习方法。
    六、天天读毛主席著作和天天读报可以适当穿插进行。在一般情况下，采取一天读毛主席著作，一天读报的方法。
    怎样运用活材料对战士进行阶级教育
    青年战士生在红旗下，长在甜水里，没有亲身尝过旧社会阶级剥削、阶级压迫的痛苦，缺乏阶级斗争的感性知识。连队对他们进行阶级教育的时候，除了大抓毛主席著作的学习以外，还要善于运用各种活材料，进行活的教育。活材料用得好，教育就生动具体，效果就大，也能促使阶级教育经常化。
    阶级教育的活材料到处都有，方法可以多种多样。如：（1）动员战士问家史、写家史，建立“血泪账”和“翻身账”，组织忆苦思甜，让战士知道昔日苦和今日甜；（2）把讲家史、讲现实阶级斗争的家信，征得战士同意以后，张贴出来，供战士阅读；（3）充分利用报纸刊登的阶级斗争材料，如国际国内阶级斗争资料，《不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇》、《美帝在南越的罪行》等专栏，经常对战士进行教育；（4）组织战士到工厂、农村访贫问苦，请老工人、老贫农讲阶级斗争史；（5）到正在进行社会主义教育运动的地方，请工作队介绍情况，参加群众的斗争大会，参观社会主义教育运动展览；（6）请部队参加地方社会主义教育运动的干部作报告，或者请他们提供材料，向连队进行教育；（7）野营时，路过烈士纪念碑、烈士陵园、烈士遇难场所，利用机会参观，组织现场讨论，学习革命烈士的英雄事迹，了解阶级敌人的残暴罪行；（8）请探家战士、来队家属介绍家乡阶级斗争现实情况；（9）组织战士阅读揭露帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三大敌人罪恶的书籍，看有关阶级斗争的电影、戏剧、小说，并发动大家谈感想和体会等等。
    怎样用好活材料？
    一、目的性要明确。运用活材料进行阶级教育，事先要考虑解决连队什么认识问题和思想问题。每进行一次活动，就收到一次教育效果。不要图形式，走过场。
    二、做好准备。到一个地方参观访问，看什么，听什么，事先选好地点和人物。请人作报告，要提出要求；请农民或来队家属作报告，事先要帮助报告人选择和组织材料。参观烈士纪念碑或纪念物，先了解烈士生平事迹，向部队作简要介绍。
    三、用毛主席观点统帅活材料。参观访问或作报告之前，针对所要解决的问题，学习一两条毛主席语录，教育大家以毛主席的观点作武器，去看、去听、去问。参观访问或听报告之后，认真学习有关的毛主席著作，组织讨论，引导大家运用毛主席的观点，具体分析看到、听到的材料。并采取领导和群众相结合的方法，作好总结，帮助大家把感性认识提高到理性认识。
    四、注意了解效果。组织一次活动以后，摸清哪些问题解决了，哪些问题没有解决，又出现了哪些新的问题，然后采取各种办法继续进行教育。
    五、运用活材料进行阶级教育，根本目的是要提高战士的阶级觉悟。因此，教育中，要注意启发战士弄清什么是阶级，什么是剥削，什么是阶级斗争；懂得三大敌人是怎样残酷压榨中国人民的；懂得在社会主义社会，阶级斗争有了什么新的特点；特别要引导战士把国内阶级斗争和国际阶级斗争联系起来，高度仇恨美帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义，高度同情世界上被压迫的人民，树立世界革命思想。
    怎样加深战士对美帝国主义的阶级仇恨
    战士黄启彪对美帝国主义的认识过程，很能说明这个问题。
    他说：我入伍以前只知道地主、国民党压迫剥削人民，也听说过日本鬼子杀人放火的事，我五叔就是被日本强盗打死的，所以，从小就恨它们。对美帝国主义，那时也知道它坏。但对它的罪行，却很少听说。
    一九六四年初，刚到部队，参加忆苦教育，许多同志控诉了旧社会地主、国民党的罪行，连里又请来一位归国老华侨控诉了美帝国主义的罪行。接着，学了《中国社会各阶级的分析》。指导员引导我们挖苦根，使我懂得了在旧社会所以受苦，是因为受地主的剥削；而地主的靠山是蒋介石，蒋介石又靠他的美国干爸爸。这下才把自己的苦和美帝国主义的侵略罪行联系起来，使我懂得了美帝国主义和地主、资本家、国民党、日本侵略者都是一伙，都一样坏。
    但是，美帝国主义到底做过哪些坏事？了解还不多。这个问题是经过连里经常组织“算旧账，谈新仇”活动解决的。指导员经常组织我们学习毛主席的《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》、《“友谊”，还是侵略？》等文章，给我们讲美帝侵华史，又读了《美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌》，才知道这个坏家伙，在一百多年前就开始侵略我国，它欠的血债真是算不清。过去还以为它做过些“好事”，其实，它在中国办工厂、开矿山，是为了直接对我们进行剥削；办学校、建教堂，是为了培养走狗，麻痹中国人民的革命意志；办育婴堂，杀害了许多中国儿童；办医院，拿中国人做试验。这样把它“慈善”的画皮层层剥掉了，就看到它处处与中国人民为敌。解放后，它死不甘心，发动侵略朝鲜战争，想走日本侵略中国的老路；强占我国台湾，支持蒋匪窜犯大陆；直接派飞机、军舰侵犯我国领空、领海，妄想卷土重来，重新骑在我国人民的头上。它从过去到现在，都是中国人民的死对头。
    过去我心里还经常琢磨一个问题：是不是因为美帝国主义跟中国有仇，才故意跟我们过不去？我这种不正确的想法，经过领导上讲美帝国主义在世界各地的罪行，引导大家以自己过去的苦，比今天各国被压迫人民的苦，才有了正确的认识。连里经常讲时事，读报纸，每天都讲到美帝国主义在国内压迫剥削人民，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国抢财富，杀人民，镇压革命运动，使我认识到美帝国主义不仅和中国作对，也和全世界人民作对，它是全世界人民的共同敌人。特别是读了《南方来信》，看了美帝国主义侵略越南的电影，更使我恨透了美帝国主义。
    过去我不懂得美帝国主义为什么这么坏，后来指导员用阶级分析方法，给我们讲美国政府是垄断资产阶级的代表，又揭了它现在的“班底”：总统约翰逊是个大农场主，国防部长是个汽车公司的经理。这些家伙是靠剥削、侵略和战争发财的。他们是美国人民的吸血鬼，也是骑在世界人民头上的大地主、大资本家，不剥削人、不压迫人，他们一天也活不成。懂得了美帝国主义的阶级本性，我对美帝国主义就恨得更深。一想到美帝国主义还在世界各地杀人放火，为非作歹，全世界还有千千万万的人生活在水深火热之中，新仇旧恨就一齐涌上心头。在训练场上刺杀、射击时，就像是刀刺约翰逊，枪瞄美国鬼，我练兵的劲头就来了。我准备随时上战场，消灭美帝国主义，为中国人民报仇，为世界人民报仇！
    从这个战士的思想变化过程中看出，要加深战士对美帝国主义的阶级仇恨，应当做到以下几点：
    一、挖苦根，找祸首。要认真搞好新战士入伍时的忆苦教育，启发战士挖出苦根，找出祸首。认清美帝国主义是地主、国民党的后台，是中国人民一切苦难的总根。从而把大家的阶级仇恨集中到美帝国主义身上。
    二、算旧账，记新仇。以各种形式，将百年来美帝国主义侵华罪行讲给战士听。并通过经常讲形势，学时事，引导大家忆美帝国主义过去所犯罪行，看今天美帝国主义侵略活动，想今后美帝国主义侵略动向。特别要讲清楚美帝国主义今天已经把它的反革命全球战略的重点转向亚洲，把坚持马克思列宁主义，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，援助全世界被压迫阶级和被压迫民族的革命斗争的我国，当作它的主要敌人，积极准备向我国发动侵略战争的事实，以不断加深对美帝国主义的仇恨。
    三、揭老底，看野心。通过学习毛主席关于帝国主义本性的论述，引导大家运用阶级分析的武器，认清美帝国主义进行压榨、掠夺、侵略、战争，是它的阶级本性决定的。它奴役世界人民的野心是不会改变的，对它不能有任何幻想。
    四、立大志，灭美帝。激励大家把对美帝国主义的阶级仇恨记在心头上，刻在刺刀尖上，落在行动上，随时做好战斗准备，立志消灭美帝国主义，打出个新世界。　　　（未完待续）
