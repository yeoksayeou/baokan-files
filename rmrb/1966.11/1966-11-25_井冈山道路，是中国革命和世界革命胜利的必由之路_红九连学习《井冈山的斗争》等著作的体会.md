The Jinggangshan Road is the necessary path to victory for the Chinese Revolution and the World Revolution
—Red Ninth Company's Reflections on Studying "The Struggle in Jinggangshan" and Other Works

The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to resolve issues through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad.

On the eve of the 38th anniversary of the publication of "The Struggle in Jinggangshan," the Red Ninth Company, which followed Chairman Mao to persist in the Jinggangshan struggle, and is now known as the "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works" in the People's Liberation Army's Shenyang forces, re-studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work, as well as "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?" and "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire." They linked their company's glorious struggle history and the current excellent revolutionary situation, discussed their study reflections, and unanimously agreed that 38 years ago, after the failure of the Great Revolution, when the Chinese revolution was at its most critical juncture, Chairman Mao led the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to Jinggangshan, established a revolutionary base area, turned around the revolutionary situation, and pushed the Chinese revolution forward to victory. In the great revolutionary practice, Chairman Mao successively published these three brilliant works, providing the most correct and highest-level Marxist-Leninist answers to the key issues of the Chinese revolution, pointing out the path to victory for the Chinese revolution. The soldiers said: The Jinggangshan Road is the necessary path to victory for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

What is the Jinggangshan Road? The soldiers unanimously and loudly responded in the discussion: The Jinggangshan Road is the road of armed struggle, the road of establishing rural revolutionary base areas, implementing the strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing the cities, which is the road of Mao Zedong Thought guiding the victory of the Chinese revolution. More than 30 years ago, the revolutionary flame ignited by Mao Zedong Thought in Jinggangshan burned brighter and brighter, illuminating Jinggangshan, illuminating all of China, and it will surely illuminate the entire world.

With revolutionary arms, we can defeat the armed counter-revolutionaries.

The soldiers said, Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us that the Chinese revolution develops military actions through uprisings, which is a characteristic. He also said: "Without a considerable force of regular armed units, it is impossible to create a situation of armed struggle, let alone a long-term and increasingly developing situation of armed struggle. Therefore, the thought of 'armed struggle by workers and peasants' is an important thought that the Communist Party and the workers and peasants in the base areas must fully possess." The thought of armed struggle runs through these three works. Whether or not to engage in armed struggle is the dividing line between Chairman Mao's correct revolutionary line and the right-opportunist line of capitulation.

Political instructor Qiao Yunqi said, Chairman Mao taught us that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. With the gun, there is everything for the people; without the gun, there is nothing for the people. This is an extremely great, extremely wise, and extremely correct judgment. Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist line of capitulation opposed the revolutionary people seizing the gun, opposed armed struggle, and surrendered to the bourgeoisie. The reactionaries, based on their counter-revolutionary nature, understand very well that "having a gun is king," and they tightly grasp the reactionary guns, using the reactionary guns to brutally massacre revolutionary people. The great revolution was thus buried by Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist line of capitulation. Revolutionary people learned from the bloody lessons that the enemy does not fall unless beaten, and the armed enemy must be beaten with our guns. The red political power must be established, defended, and developed with our guns. To make a revolution and seek liberation, without guns and armed struggle, it is just empty talk.

Active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Wang Jigang, said, after the failure of the Great Revolution, our company's revolutionary forerunners followed Chairman Mao's teachings, participated in armed uprisings, seized guns, and went to Jinggangshan to make a revolution with Chairman Mao. With arms, with a regular Red Army, and with the Red Guards, the revolutionary political power had a strong pillar, and the revolution rapidly developed. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of armed struggle by workers and peasants, the broad masses of peasants in Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, and other provinces launched armed uprisings one after another, establishing one revolutionary armed force after another and one red revolutionary base area after another, fundamentally changing the revolutionary situation.

Class leader Yang Zhenjie said, the current excellent situation of international struggle also fully proves that the thought of armed struggle pointed out by Chairman Mao more than 30 years ago is the thought of victory for the revolution; the more intense the armed struggle in a place, the faster the revolutionary situation develops there, and the closer it is to victory. The heroic Vietnamese people's victories in the anti-American national salvation struggle are all won with guns; the Vietnamese people's high status in the international arena today is also won with guns. Modern revisionists fear revolution, fear the people, surrender to American imperialism, and vigorously advocate the abolition of armed struggle, which thoroughly exposes their traitorous faces. We must resolutely fight against them.

The base area is the place where Mao Zedong Thought takes root, the starting point for seizing revolutionary victory.

The soldiers said in the discussion that in these three brilliant works, Chairman Mao made the most brilliant and correct analysis of the political and economic characteristics of Chinese society, pointing out the path to victory for the Chinese revolution: establishing rural revolutionary base areas, encircling the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing the cities. This is Chairman Mao's brilliant contribution to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, our revolutionary forerunners followed this path, establishing one red base area after another, continuously developing and strengthening the revolutionary forces, smashing the enemy's continuous brutal attacks, and ultimately defeating the Japanese invaders, overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and achieving national liberation.

The soldiers said, which path to take to win the Chinese revolution? This was a focal point in the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the "left" opportunist line. The "left" opportunists did not understand the characteristics of Chinese society, did not understand the important position of the peasant problem in the Chinese revolution, opposed long-term and arduous work among the peasants, opposed the establishment of rural revolutionary base areas, and fantasized about seizing national victory through urban armed uprisings. The "left" opportunist errors brought serious losses to the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao stood the highest and saw the farthest. In these three brilliant works, he correctly pointed out that the Chinese revolution was actually a peasant revolution, and the peasant problem occupied an extremely important position in the Chinese revolution, fundamentally answering the great significance of relying on the peasants and establishing rural revolutionary base areas for the victory of the Chinese revolution; he correctly pointed out that the vast rural areas were the weakest places of the reactionary rule, the broadest arena for revolutionaries to grow from small to large and from weak to strong, to prepare, accumulate, and temper revolutionary forces, and also the strongest reliance and starting point for defeating the enemy and ultimately seizing the cities. He correctly pointed out that the rural revolutionary base areas and red political power not only could exist but would also develop day by day. A single spark can start a prairie fire. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao not only brilliantly answered these questions of decisive significance to the Chinese revolution after the failure of the Great Revolution in theory but also personally led the troops to Jinggangshan, deeply carried out the land revolution, mobilized the peasants, relied on the peasants, and re-established the revolutionary stronghold, preparing for the arrival of a new revolutionary high tide. Our company is the product of Chairman Mao's correct line during the Jinggangshan struggle, the tool for implementing this correct line, and also the witness to the victory of this correct line.

Class leader Zhang Wenkuai said, our company's revolutionary forerunners told us that during the Autumn Harvest Uprising, Chairman Mao personally led the troops to Jinggangshan. The revolutionary flame ignited by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan made the reactionaries panic and restless. In April 1928, the reactionaries mobilized troops to begin the "extermination" of Jinggangshan, with the most troops reaching 18 regiments and the least 8 or 9 regiments. Our Ninth Company and the brother units participated in this struggle to defend the Jinggangshan base area. At that time, the Red Army had fewer than four regiments, and guns and ammunition were scarce. However, we had Chairman Mao's correct leadership, a solid rural revolutionary base area as a support, and the support of the broad masses of peasants, fighting against the enemy in a head-on struggle. "The enemy surrounds us on all sides, but we stand firm." We fought against the enemy for four months, winning battle after battle, expanding the base area day by day, deepening the land revolution day by day, spreading the red political power day by day, strengthening the Red Army and the Red Guards day by day, and improving the revolutionary situation day by day. However, in August, the wrong leadership excluded Chairman Mao's correct line and implemented the "left" opportunist line, wrongly ordering the Red Army to leave the base area and split into mobile guerrilla units, causing the developing Hunan-Jiangxi border area and the isolated Fourth Red Army in southern Hunan to suffer serious defeats. Fortunately, Chairman Mao rushed from Jinggangshan, corrected the direction, and led our company's revolutionary forerunners back to the Jinggangshan base area and back to the correct path. Our company's history in the Jinggangshan struggle most powerfully illustrates that the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao is the only correct path. Following this path, the revolution wins and develops forward; leaving this path, the revolution suffers setbacks and fails. We deeply feel that Chairman Mao's words cannot be doubted, and Chairman Mao's path cannot be left. Forever following Chairman Mao, the revolution will forever win.

The Jinggangshan Road is the necessary path to victory for the world revolution.

The soldiers of the Red Ninth Company reviewed Chairman Mao's brilliant works written during the Jinggangshan struggle, looked at the world's excellent situation, and were full of boundless confidence in the victory of the world revolution. Active learners of Chairman Mao's works, Zheng Guozhong, and Li Kexi said, Chairman Mao's brilliant works are not only the magic weapon of the Chinese people's revolution but also the magic weapon of the world people's revolution; the Jinggangshan Road personally opened by Chairman Mao is not only the path to victory for the Chinese revolution but also the necessary path to victory for the world revolution; the torch lit by Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan illuminates the path of the world revolution and will forever shine with golden light. The people of the world revolution are advancing along the Jinggangshan Road, creating an excellent situation: the wind and thunder move, the banners flutter, the flames spread everywhere, and the victories are frequent.

The soldiers unanimously agreed that today, under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, the seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought in China have become a powerful revolutionary base area in the world. This is a red revolutionary base area far stronger than the Jinggangshan of yesteryears. "The seas are turbulent with clouds and waves, and the continents shake with thunder and lightning." More and more countries and regions in the world are treating Chairman Mao as the red sun in their hearts, treating China as the great base area of the world revolution, and treating the Jinggangshan Road as the necessary path to victory for the world revolution. The soldiers said with great revolutionary enthusiasm: Our revolutionary forerunners started from Jinggangshan, closely followed Chairman Mao, and in the blink of an eye, won a red China. Now, we and the people of the world, following Chairman Mao, can reach the moon and catch the turtles in the five oceans, and we will surely win a red world.

Facing the victorious situation of the world revolution, the soldiers of the Red Ninth Company felt that their responsibility to support the world revolution was even greater, and their spirit to strive for the world revolution's victory was even higher. Everyone decided to better inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan and accelerate the process of the world revolution. New soldier Qiu Guohuan said, inheriting and carrying forward the spirit of Jinggangshan is to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to grasp the study and application of Chairman Mao's works more tightly, to work harder on the words, to practice Mao Zedong Thought in one hundred percent of practice, to establish Mao Zedong Thought in one hundred percent of the ideological battlefield, to treat the study of Chairman Mao's works as the first need of life, to treat Mao Zedong Thought as the first life, to treat the transformation of worldview as the most fundamental combat task, and to treat supporting the world revolution as the most important struggle goal. The soldiers said: We must, with the greatest determination, the highest consciousness, the most effective measures, and the most resolute actions, respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the company to a new stage, make every officer and soldier in the company a red seed of spreading Mao Zedong Thought, a red spark of promoting the world revolution, and contribute greater strength to the world revolution.

"We are the company that came from Jinggangshan, and we are holding high the revolutionary torch lit by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan. The heavy responsibility of the world revolution, we will undertake, and the victory of the world revolution, we will strive for day and night. We will sweep away all the harmful insects, and there will be no enemies." This is the bold words of the soldiers of the Red Ninth Company, vowing to be promoters of the world revolution, and it is also the common resolve of the broad masses of soldiers in the army.

    井冈山道路，是中国革命和世界革命胜利的必由之路
    ——红九连学习《井冈山的斗争》等著作的体会
    革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。
    在《井冈山的斗争》发表三十八周年前夕，当年跟随毛主席坚持井冈山斗争的红九连——人民解放军沈阳部队“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”的指战员，重新学习了毛主席的这一光辉著作以及《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》《星星之火，可以燎原》等光辉著作。他们联系连队的光荣斗争历史和当前的大好革命形势，畅谈学习体会，一致认为，三十八年前，大革命失败后，当中国革命处于最危急的关头，毛主席率领工农红军进军井冈山，创建革命根据地，扭转了革命局势，把中国革命胜利地推向前进。在伟大革命实践中，毛主席先后发表了这三篇光辉著作，对中国革命的关键问题作了最正确的最高水平的马克思列宁主义的回答，给中国革命指明了胜利的道路。指战员们说：走井冈山道路，是中国革命和世界革命胜利的必由之路。
    什么是井冈山道路？指战员们在座谈中一致响亮回答：井冈山道路，就是武装斗争的道路，就是建立农村革命根据地，实行农村包围城市、最后夺取城市的道路，也就是毛泽东思想指导中国革命胜利的道路。三十多年前，毛泽东思想在井冈山燃起的革命火焰，越燃越烈，燃红了井冈山，燃红了全中国，也必将燃红全世界。
    有了革命的武装，才能消灭武装的反革命
    指战员们说，毛主席反复教导我们，中国革命以军事发展暴动，是一种特征。并且说：“若没有相当力量的正式武装，便决然不能造成割据局面，更不能造成长期的和日益发展的割据局面。所以‘工农武装割据’的思想，是共产党和割据地方的工农群众必须充分具备的一个重要的思想”。武装斗争的思想，贯穿了这三篇著作的始终。搞不搞武装斗争，这是毛主席的正确革命路线，与右倾投降主义路线的分水岭。
    指导员乔云歧说，毛主席教导我们，枪杆子里面出政权。有了枪杆子，就有了人民的一切；没有枪杆子，就没有人民的一切。这是极其伟大、极其英明、极其正确的论断。陈独秀右倾投降主义，反对革命人民掌握枪杆子，反对武装斗争，对资产阶级屈膝投降。而反动派从他们的反革命本性出发，很懂得“有枪便是王”，对反动的枪杆子抓得紧紧的，用反动的枪杆子血腥屠杀革命人民。轰轰烈烈的大革命，就是这样被陈独秀右倾投降主义葬送的。革命人民从血的教训中懂得，敌人是不打不倒的，拿枪的敌人，就要靠我们拿起枪杆，去把他们打倒。红色政权，靠我们用枪杆子去建立，去保卫，去发展。干革命，求解放，离开了枪杆子，离开了武装斗争，只能是一句空话。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子王继刚说，大革命失败以后，我们连的革命前辈遵循毛主席的教导，参加武装暴动，拿起枪杆，上了井冈山，跟随毛主席闹革命。有了武装，有了正规的红军，有了赤卫队，革命政权就有了强大的支柱，革命就迅速发展。在毛主席的工农武装割据思想的指引下，湖南、江西、湖北、四川等省的广大农民，纷纷举行武装暴动，建立起一支又一支工农武装和一块又一块红色革命根据地，革命形势发生了根本的变化。
    八班班长杨振杰说，当前国际斗争的大好形势，也充分证明了毛主席三十多年前指出的武装斗争的思想，就是革命胜利的思想；哪里的武装斗争搞得越火热，哪里的革命形势发展得就越迅速，距离胜利就越接近。英雄的越南人民抗美救国斗争的节节胜利，就是靠枪杆子打出来的；越南人民今天在国际上的崇高地位，也是靠枪杆子赢得的。现代修正主义者害怕革命，害怕人民，投降美帝国主义，极力鼓吹取消武装斗争，这彻底暴露了他们的叛徒嘴脸，我们必须和他们作坚决的斗争。
    根据地就是毛泽东思想的扎根地，是夺取革命胜利的出发点
    指战员在座谈中说，毛主席在这三篇光辉著作中，对中国社会的政治经济特点，作了最英明最正确的分析，指出了中国革命胜利的道路：建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义宝库的天才贡献。在毛主席的领导下，我们的革命前辈沿着这条道路，建立了一片又一片红色根据地，不断发展壮大革命力量，粉碎了敌人不断的残酷进攻，最后打败了日本侵略者，推翻了蒋家王朝，取得了全国的解放。
    指战员们说，走什么样的道路夺取中国革命的胜利？这是当时以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同“左”倾机会主义路线斗争的一个焦点。“左”倾机会主义者不认识中国社会的特点，不认识农民问题在中国革命中的重要地位，反对在农民中进行长期的艰苦的工作，反对建立农村革命根据地，幻想用城市武装起义，夺取全国胜利。“左”倾机会主义的错误，给中国革命带来了严重损失。毛主席站得最高，看得最远，在这三篇光辉著作中，正确地指出中国的革命实际上是农民革命，农民问题在中国革命中占有极端重要的地位，从根本上回答了依靠农民，建立农村革命根据地对中国革命胜利的重大意义；正确地指出广大农村是反动派统治最薄弱的地方，是革命者从小到大、从弱到强，准备、积蓄和锻炼革命力量的最广阔的天地，也是战胜敌人，最后夺取城市的最强大的依靠和出发点，正确地指出农村革命根据地、红色政权，不但能够存在，而且必将日益发展。星星之火，一定能够成为燎原大火。在这个关键时刻，毛主席不但从理论上天才地回答了大革命失败后对中国革命具有决定意义的这些问题，并且亲自带领队伍上了井冈山，深入开展土地革命，发动农民，依靠农民，重新建立革命阵地，准备新的革命高潮的到来。我们连队就是井冈山斗争时期毛主席的正确路线的产物，就是实现这一正确路线的工具，也是这一正确路线胜利的见证。
    四班班长张文奎说，我们连的革命前辈告诉我们，秋收起义，毛主席亲自带领队伍上了井冈山。毛主席在井冈山燃起的革命烈火，烧得反动派惊慌万状，坐立不安。一九二八年四月，反动派调兵遣将，开始向井冈山“进剿”，兵力最多时达到十八个团，最少时也有八、九个团。我们九连和兄弟部队一起参加了这场保卫井冈山根据地的斗争。当时红军兵力不足四个团，枪枝弹药又缺乏，但是，我们有毛主席的正确领导，有已经建立的坚实的农村革命根据地做依托，有广大农民的支持，和敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争。“敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动”。我们和敌人斗争了四个月，连连获胜，割据地区一天一天扩大，土地革命一天一天深入，红色政权一天一天推广，红军和赤卫队一天一天强大，革命形势越来越好。可是，到了八月，错误的领导排斥毛主席的正确路线，执行“左”倾机会主义路线，错误地让红军离开根据地，分兵流动游击，使正在发展的湘赣边界和孤军深入湘南的红四军都遭到了严重失败。幸亏毛主席从井冈山赶来，拨正了方向，把我们连的革命前辈重新领上了井冈山根据地，领上了正确的道路。我们连队在井冈山斗争的历史最有力地说明，毛主席指出的井冈山革命道路，是唯一正确的道路，沿着这条道路，革命就胜利，就向前发展；离开了这条道路，革命就会遭受挫折，遭到失败。我们最深刻体会到，毛主席说的话，一个字也不能疑，毛主席指的路，一步也不能离，永远跟着毛主席，革命就永远胜利。
    井冈山道路是世界革命胜利的必由之路
    红九连的指战员重温毛主席在井冈山斗争时期写的这几篇光辉著作，放眼世界一派大好形势，对世界革命的胜利，充满着无限的信心。学习毛主席著作积极分子郑国忠、李克西说，毛主席这些光辉著作，不仅是中国人民革命的法宝，也是世界人民革命的法宝；毛主席亲手开辟的井冈山道路，不仅是中国革命胜利的道路，也是世界革命胜利的必由之路；毛主席在井冈山上点燃的火炬，照亮了世界革命的里程，永远放射着万丈金光。世界革命人民正沿着井冈山道路，闯出一派大好形势：风雷动，旌旗奋，烽火遍地，捷报频传。
    指战员们一致认为，今天，在毛主席的英明领导下，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民的中国，已经成为世界革命的强大根据地。这是比当年的井冈山不知要强大多少倍的红色革命根据地。“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”。全世界越来越多的国家和地区的革命人民，把毛主席当作心中的红太阳，把中国当作世界革命的伟大根据地，把井冈山的道路，当作世界革命胜利的必由之路。指战员们满怀胜利豪情地说：我们的革命前辈从井冈山开始，紧紧跟着毛主席，在毛主席指引的道路上，弹指一挥间，赢得了一个红通通的新中国。现在，我们和世界人民一起，跟着毛主席，可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖，也一定能够赢得一个红通通的新世界。
    红九连的指战员面对世界革命胜利形势，感到支援世界革命的责任更加重大，为世界革命胜利“只争朝夕”的劲头也更高。大家决心更好地继承和发扬井冈山的革命精神，加速世界革命的进程。新战士仇国贤说，继承发扬井冈山精神，就是要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，把活学活用毛主席著作抓得更紧，在用字上下的功夫更狠，在百分之百的实践中大学大用毛泽东思想，在百分之百的思想阵地上大立毛泽东思想，把学习毛主席著作当作生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想当作第一生命，把世界观的改造当作最根本的战斗任务，把支援世界革命当作最重要的奋斗目标。指战员们表示：一定要以最大的决心，最高的自觉，最有效的措施，最坚决的行动响应林彪同志的号召，把连队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，使连队的每一个干部战士都成为传播毛泽东思想的红色种子，都成为促进世界革命的红色火种，为世界革命贡献更大的力量。
      “我们是来自井冈山的连队，我们高举着毛主席在井冈山点燃的革命火炬。世界革命的重担，我们挑起，世界革命的胜利，只争朝夕。我们要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”这是红九连指战员誓当世界革命促进派的豪言壮语，也是全军广大指战员的共同决心。
