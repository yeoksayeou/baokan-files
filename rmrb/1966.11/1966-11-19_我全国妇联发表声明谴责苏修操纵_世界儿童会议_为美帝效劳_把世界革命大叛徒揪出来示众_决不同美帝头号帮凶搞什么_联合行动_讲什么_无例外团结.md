The All-China Women's Federation today issued a statement strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's manipulation of the "World Children's Conference" to promote their line of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world. The full text of the statement is as follows:

From October 3 to 6, 1966, under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the International Democratic Federation of Women convened a "World Children's Conference" in Stockholm. This conference was orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists to push their line of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world. The women of China resolutely refused to send representatives to participate and sent a telegram to the conference, stating their principled stance and exposing the Soviet revisionists' conspiracy. After the conference, the Soviet leadership and their followers shamelessly used the name of the conference presidium to send a telegram to the All-China Women's Federation, launching vicious attacks and slander against the women of China. The Soviet revisionist propaganda machines, such as Tass and Pravda, along with the American United Press International, responded in unison, spreading anti-China propaganda and incitement. The All-China Women's Federation expresses great indignation and strong protest against this.

The evil imperialist system has brought immense disasters to the people of the world. U.S. imperialism is the greatest aggressor in human history and the most vicious enemy of women and children worldwide. The people and women of the world must unite to overthrow U.S. imperialism, completely uproot the source of aggression, oppression, enslavement, and exploitation, and strive for the ultimate victory of the world revolution. The Soviet revisionist leadership is acting contrary to the principles of revolution, striving to maintain imperialist rule, and is eager for Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world. They have actively promoted this revisionist, capitulationist line at a series of international conferences. Recently, they orchestrated the "World Children's Conference," using discussions on children's living conditions, health, education, and other professional issues as a cover to peddle this line. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the women of China are deeply loyal to the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the world's people, harbor a deep hatred for U.S. imperialism, and have extreme contempt for the Soviet revisionist leadership. Naturally, they would not participate in such a conference. Now, we must further expose the conspiracy played by the Soviet revisionists at this conference and bring out this number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, this great traitor to the world revolution, and this scab on the international workers' movement to be publicly condemned.

Revolutionary women around the world have always believed that protecting the world's children requires a resolute struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. The Soviet revisionists and their followers, however, turn cause and effect on their head, attributing war, hunger, disease, and ignorance to being the enemies of children, shifting the target of struggle, and serving U.S. imperialism. They elevate the United Nations' "Declaration of the Rights of the Child" as the highest program, demanding that the United Nations provide "international protection" for women and children in various countries, and heavily promoting the so-called "aid" from the United Nations. More and more people have come to realize: the United Nations is a tool of U.S. aggression and a site for U.S.-Soviet political deals. The Soviet leadership's praise for the United Nations is to cover up their scheme to drag the world children's movement into the trap of Soviet-American cooperation.

The Vietnamese issue is the focal point of the world's anti-U.S. struggle and the key area for Soviet-American cooperation to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the world's people. Currently, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are jointly stirring up a "stop-bombing and negotiate" frenzy to create a smokescreen for the new round of war escalation being planned by U.S. imperialism. At the "World Children's Conference," the Soviet revisionists and their followers did not condemn U.S. imperialism's "war escalation" in Vietnam and did not mention supporting Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to fight to the end for a complete victory. Instead, they shouted slogans like "immediately stop bombing North Vietnam" and "end this war by all possible means." This is their confession of colluding with U.S. imperialism to conspire against the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle for national liberation. The Chinese people and the people of the world resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, until they completely annihilate the U.S. aggressor troops in the sea of people's war. U.S. imperialism is doomed to failure, and its number one accomplice, Soviet revisionism, will also meet a bad end.

The Soviet revisionists also use the pretext of "for the children" to shout slogans like "oppose nuclear proliferation" and "stop all nuclear tests," claiming that nuclear tests are "the source of war and danger," directing their arrows at China and all peace-loving countries threatened by nuclear weapons, attempting to consolidate the nuclear monopoly of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. China's successful launch of missile and nuclear weapons tests has already smashed the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. No matter what nuclear tricks they play, they are doomed to fail.

We are now in a new and great era. The two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution are engaged in their final struggle. The revolutionary people of the world are raising the banner of unity against imperialism, forging the broadest anti-U.S. united front, and the revolutionary tide is surging forward, irresistible. The Soviet revisionists, however, are shouting at the top of their lungs about "unity among all countries without exception" and slandering the women of China for "harming" the anti-imperialist unity of the world's women. This is just one part of their criminal dealings of aligning with the U.S. and betraying the world's people. The Soviet revisionist leadership has sold out to U.S. imperialism, broken up the anti-imperialist unity of the revolutionary people, and is the biggest splitist. To oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism; to align with the U.S. is to oppose China. This is an unshakable truth. The three hundred million Chinese women who are holding high the banner of the anti-imperialist revolution have the reddest hearts, the brightest eyes, and the most steadfast stance. They will never engage in any "joint actions" or talk about "unity without exception" with the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The great unity of the world's people against imperialism is to distinguish between friends and enemies, to exclude the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, which is the accomplice of imperialism.

For the liberation of all humanity and the happiness of future generations, we Chinese women will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with revolutionary women of the world, overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, and overthrow the reactionaries of all countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without an exploitative system will definitely be established.

    我全国妇联发表声明谴责苏修操纵“世界儿童会议”为美帝效劳
    把世界革命大叛徒揪出来示众
    决不同美帝头号帮凶搞什么“联合行动”讲什么“无例外团结”
    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天发表声明，严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团操纵“世界儿童会议”推行苏美合作主宰世界的投降主义路线的阴谋。这个声明全文如下：
    一九六六年十月三——六日，在苏联修正主义领导集团操纵下，由国际妇联出面，在斯德哥尔摩召开了一个“世界儿童会议”。这个会议是苏联修正主义为了推行其苏美合作主宰世界的投降主义路线所一手策划的。中国妇女断然拒绝派代表参加，并打电报给会议，阐明了自己的严正立场，戳穿了苏联修正主义召开会议的阴谋。苏联领导集团及其追随者，竟然在会后无耻地盗用会议主席团名义，给中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会来电，对中国妇女进行恶毒的攻击和诽谤。塔斯社、《真理报》等苏修宣传机器和美国合众国际社相互呼应，大肆渲染，煽动反华。中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会对此表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    万恶的帝国主义制度带给全世界人民巨大的灾难，美帝国主义是人类历史上最大的侵略者，是全世界妇女和儿童最凶恶的敌人。全世界人民和妇女必须团结起来，打倒美帝国主义，彻底挖掉侵略、压迫、奴役、剥削的总根子，为实现世界革命的完全胜利而奋斗到底。苏联修正主义领导集团倒行逆施，竭力维护帝国主义统治，热中于苏美合作主宰世界。他们在一系列国际会议上积极推行这条修正主义、投降主义路线。最近，他们策划召开的“世界儿童会议”，就是用讨论儿童的生活条件、健康、教育等专业性问题作掩盖，为贩卖这条路线搞的一个骗局。在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国妇女，对世界人民的反帝革命事业无限忠诚，对美帝国主义刻骨仇恨，对苏联修正主义领导集团万分憎恶，当然不会参加这样的会议。现在，我们要进一步揭穿苏联修正主义者在这一会议上玩弄的阴谋，把这个美帝国主义的头号帮凶、世界革命的大叛徒、国际工人运动的工贼揪出来示众。
    全世界革命妇女向来认为，保卫世界儿童，必须同以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义作坚决的斗争。苏联修正主义及其追随者却倒果为因，把战争、饥饿、疾病、愚昧说成是儿童的敌人，转移斗争目标，为美帝效劳。他们捧出联合国“儿童权利宣言”作为最高纲领，要求联合国为各国妇女儿童提供“国际保护”，为联合国的所谓“援助”大做广告。越来越多的人已经认识到：联合国是美帝的侵略工具，是美苏政治交易所。苏联领导对联合国如此吹捧，就是要在这块烂招牌的掩盖下，把世界儿童运动拖入苏美合作的圈套。
    越南问题是世界反美斗争的焦点，也是苏美合作镇压世界人民革命斗争的重点。当前，美苏正在合伙煽起一股“停炸诱和”的妖风，为美帝正在策划的新的战争升级制造烟幕。苏联修正主义及其追随者在“世界儿童会议”上，根本不谴责美帝在越南的“战争升级”，丝毫不提支持胡志明主席发出的要坚决战斗到彻底胜利的号召书，相反地，却大嚷“立即停炸北越”、“用一切可能的办法结束这场战争”，这正是他们勾结美帝，共谋扑灭越南人民的抗美救国战争的自供。中国人民和全世界人民坚决支持英雄的越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略军全部消灭在人民战争的火海里。美帝国主义是注定要失败的，它的头号帮凶苏联修正主义也决不会有好下场。
    苏联修正主义还打着“为了儿童”的幌子，大喊“反对核扩散”，“停止一切核试验”，说什么核试验是“发生战争和危险的根源”，把矛头针对中国和一切受到核威胁的爱好和平的国家，妄图巩固美苏的核垄断地位。中国发射导弹核武器试验成功，已经把美苏核垄断、核讹诈通通砸烂。不管他们再玩弄什么核骗局，都注定是要破产的。
    我们正处于一个新的伟大的时代。革命和反革命两大势力正在作最后斗争。全世界革命人民高举团结反帝大旗，结成最广泛的反美统一战线，革命浪潮，汹涌澎湃，势不可当。苏联修正主义却声嘶力竭地鼓吹什么“各国之间无例外地实行团结”，并诬蔑中国妇女“损害”了世界妇女的反帝团结。这不过是他们联美、反华、出卖世界人民的罪恶勾当的一个组成部分。苏联修正主义领导集团卖身投靠美帝国主义，破坏革命人民的反帝团结，是最大的分裂主义者。反帝必须反修，联美必然反华，这是一条颠扑不破的真理。高举反帝革命大旗的三亿中国妇女，心最红，眼最亮，立场最坚定，决不会同美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团搞什么“联合行动”，讲什么“无例外的团结”。
    世界人民的反帝大团结就是要敌我分明，就是要把帝国主义的帮凶以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义除外。
    为了全人类的解放，为了子孙万代的幸福，我们中国妇女将永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，和全世界革命妇女团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。
