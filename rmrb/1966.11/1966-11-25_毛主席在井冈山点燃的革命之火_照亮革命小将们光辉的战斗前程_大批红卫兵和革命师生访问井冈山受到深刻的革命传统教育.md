The revolutionary fire lit by our great leader Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan, the first revolutionary base area established by Chairman Mao himself, has illuminated the bright battle path of revolutionary youth. Large numbers of Red Guards and revolutionary students have visited Jinggangshan and received profound revolutionary traditional education.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, November 24th: The first revolutionary base area in China, established by our great leader Chairman Mao, Jinggangshan, has received large numbers of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country. These revolutionary youth, filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, have come to Jinggangshan to visit and study. When they pinned on the commemorative badges symbolizing the revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan, they excitedly said: The Jinggangshan badge shines with the golden light of Mao Zedong Thought; wearing it, we will never forget the revolutionary tradition; wearing it, we will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao! Forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!

Among these revolutionary youth, many, like the Red Army of old, carried their luggage on their backs, wore straw sandals, and trekked long distances to climb Jinggangshan on foot. As soon as they reached the mountain, they went to the places where Chairman Mao used to work and read Chairman Mao's books, and labored with the people in the places where Chairman Mao had worked. They visited revolutionary sites, listened to revolutionary veterans tell the history of the Jinggangshan struggle, and ate the "traditional meals" of red rice and pumpkin soup. The revolutionary youth showed deep affection for every revolutionary site, every battleground, and every blade of grass and tree on Jinggangshan.

During their days in Jinggangshan, the revolutionary youth repeatedly visited revolutionary veterans and asked old Red Army soldiers to tell stories about Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan, learning revolutionary traditions from them. They were particularly interested in the straw sandals of Jinggangshan. As early as August, some Red Guards had written letters to the revolutionary veterans of Jinggangshan, saying: "In the difficult years, under the enemy's gunfire, our great leader Chairman Mao wore straw sandals, leading the revolutionary forerunners, traversing thousands of mountains and rivers, and establishing revolutionary power. Now we have caught up. We will inherit the glorious tradition of the revolutionary forerunners, wear straw sandals, and forever follow Chairman Mao to revolution to the end." Now, they have come to Jinggangshan to personally learn from the old Red Army soldiers how to make straw sandals. As they learn, they sing the "Straw Sandal Song": "Revolutionary forerunners wore them, crossing thousands of mountains and rivers, now the straw sandals are passed to us, forever forward on the revolutionary path..." They proudly hold up the straw sandals they made, vowing: We must teach more people to make straw sandals, pass down the tradition of the Red Army's hard struggle from generation to generation, and let Mao Zedong Thought shine forever.

The Red Guards who came to Jinggangshan also underwent hardship training through activities such as camping. Huangyangjie is one of the five major watchtowers of Jinggangshan, with a majestic and treacherous terrain. Many Red Guard youth fearlessly climbed Huangyangjie and, full of enthusiasm, recited Chairman Mao's brilliant poem "West Lake Moon (Jinggangshan)" and asked revolutionary veterans to tell stories of the battles of old. Not long ago, a group of Red Guards from various places climbed Huangyangjie during a heavy rainstorm. The path was steep and slippery, making it difficult to walk, but not a single one of them retreated. They thought of Chairman Mao, and their bodies were filled with boundless strength, overcoming all difficulties. They deeply felt: With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we can defeat any enemy, overcome any difficulty, and climb any peak.

Through their visits and tours, the Red Guard youth gained a deeper understanding of the revolutionary forerunners' firm and thorough revolutionary spirit, greatly boosting their morale. Minority students from Xinjiang's August 1st Agricultural College said after their visit: The struggle in Jinggangshan made us realize even more how hard-won our revolutionary victory is. We must never forget hardship and must never abandon tradition.

After visiting Jinggangshan, the revolutionary youth made pledges and vows, determined to forever advance bravely along the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao. A Red Guard from Yunnan Physical Education Institute's affiliated middle school said: The revolutionary "spark" lit by Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan has already spread throughout China and the world. The fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution lit by Chairman Mao has also spread throughout China and shaken the world. Mao Zedong Thought is invincible. We will read Chairman Mao's books for life and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

The revolutionary youth of "Chao Hui Long March Team" from Hunan University arrived in the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan on foot from Changsha.

### 毛主席在井冈山点燃的革命之火  照亮革命小将们光辉的战斗前程  大批红卫兵和革命师生访问井冈山受到深刻的革命传统教育

    毛主席在井冈山点燃的革命之火
    照亮革命小将们光辉的战斗前程
    大批红卫兵和革命师生访问井冈山受到深刻的革命传统教育
    据新华社南昌二十四日电　我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手创建的中国革命第一个根据地——井冈山，接待了来自全国各地的大批红卫兵和革命师生。这些怀着对毛主席无限热爱的心情来到井冈山的革命小将，在井冈山进行了访问、学习等项活动。他们在佩戴上象征井冈山革命精神的纪念章的时候，一个个兴奋地说：井冈山纪念章，闪耀着毛泽东思想的金光；佩上它，革命传统永不忘；佩上它，永远忠于毛主席！永远忠于毛泽东思想！
    这些革命小将中，许多人像当年红军那样，身背行李，脚穿草鞋，经过长途跋涉，徒步登上井冈山。一上山，他们就到毛主席当年办公的地方读毛主席的书，到毛主席劳动过的地方和群众一块劳动。他们参观革命旧址，请革命老人讲井冈山斗争史，吃红米、南瓜汤的“传统饭”。革命小将对井冈山的每一处革命旧址，每一个战斗过的山头，对井冈山的一草一木，都表现出了深厚的感情。
    革命小将们在井冈山的日子里，一次又一次走访革命老人，请老红军讲毛主席在井冈山的故事，向老红军学习革命传统。他们对井冈山的草鞋特别感兴趣。早在八月间，一部分红卫兵就曾写信给井冈山的革命老人，信中说：“在艰苦的岁月里，在敌人的枪林弹雨中，我们伟大领袖毛主席穿着草鞋，带领革命前辈，踏遍了万水千山，建立了革命政权。如今我们跟上来了，我们要继承革命前辈的光荣传统，穿上草鞋，永远跟着毛主席，革命到底。”现在，他们到井冈山来亲自向老红军学习打草鞋。他们边学边唱《草鞋歌》：“革命前辈穿着它，走过万水和千山，如今草鞋交给咱，革命路上永向前……”。他们捧着打好的草鞋激动地表示：一定要教会更多的人打草鞋，让红军艰苦奋斗的传统代代传下去，让毛泽东思想永放光芒。
    来到井冈山的红卫兵们，还通过野营等活动进行艰苦锻炼。黄洋界是井冈山五大哨口之一，地势雄伟险峻。许多红卫兵小将们不畏艰险，攀登上黄洋界以后，兴致勃勃地朗读毛主席写的《西江月（井冈山）》这一光辉诗篇，请革命老人讲述当年的战斗故事。不久前，一支来自各地的红卫兵队伍攀登黄洋界时，正遇大风大雨，山陡路滑，行走困难，但是他们没有一个退缩。他们一想到毛主席，浑身增添了无限力量，一个个困难全被克服。他们深有体会地说：有了毛泽东思想引路，什么敌人都能消灭，什么困难都能战胜，什么高峰都能攀上。
    通过参观访问，红卫兵小将对革命前辈坚定彻底的革命精神有了更深的理解，大大鼓舞了他们的斗志。新疆八一农学院的少数民族同学参观后说：井冈山的斗争，使我们更加认识到革命胜利来之不易，我们决不能忘了艰苦，丢了传统。
    革命小将在参观井冈山以后，纷纷表决心，立誓言，决心永远朝着毛主席指引的革命航道奋勇前进。云南体育学院附中一个红卫兵说：毛主席在井冈山点燃起的革命的“星星之火”，已经燃遍全中国，全世界，毛主席点燃起的无产阶级文化大革命之火，又已燃遍全中国，震动全世界，毛泽东思想无往不胜，我们一定要读一辈子毛主席的书，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。（附图片）
