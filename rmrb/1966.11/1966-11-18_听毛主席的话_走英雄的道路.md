The 10th of October is a day I will never forget. It marked a new starting point in my life and a milestone in my ideological transformation. On this day, my fellow villager, comrade-in-arms who enlisted at the same time, and classmate who had been with me in the same platoon for eight months, Cai Yongxiang, sacrificed his life!

In the days following Cai Yongxiang's martyrdom, my heart was heavy with sorrow. I was saddened by the loss of such a good comrade, but also proud to have had him as a comrade. Chairman Mao said, "To struggle means to sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the majority of the people's suffering. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai. We must be prepared to sacrifice our lives for the people." Cai Yongxiang followed Chairman Mao's instructions and was a good soldier of Chairman Mao. His death was a noble one, heavier than Mount Tai. I resolved to learn from him and turn my sorrow into strength.

Cai Yongxiang's sacrifice stirred my soul. I repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," which Cai Yongxiang and I often studied together, reflecting on how he practiced it in his life and at critical moments; comparing how I thought and acted. Finally, I realized a seemingly simple but actually profound truth: heroic deeds stem from the great thoughts of Mao Zedong. Only those who are completely and thoroughly selfless in ordinary times can be completely and thoroughly fearless in critical moments; only those who dare to smash the strongholds of individualism with thorough revolutionary spirit can be completely and thoroughly selfless. I understood this truth, found my shortcomings, saw the direction, and suddenly felt full of energy, more firmly believing: follow Chairman Mao's words, walk the path of heroes, be completely and thoroughly selfless for the people, unchanging even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble.

On the afternoon of October 12, with profound respect for the hero Cai Yongxiang, I studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their blood-stained path!" I silently told myself, "Xia Yingmin, remember: Cai Yongxiang, stepping on the blood of revolutionary martyrs, following the examples of many heroes, used his life to show his loyalty. Now you must also remember Chairman Mao's teachings, bury your comrade's body, wipe off the blood on your body, and continue the fight!"

A serious test came. At 2 PM on October 12, I went on duty at the seventh sentry post, the same post where Cai Yongxiang sacrificed his life. Around 3:20 PM, about sixty-one hours after Cai Yongxiang's martyrdom, I noticed a woman about eighty-five meters away on the railway tracks, hugging two children, with a little girl following behind. Suddenly, a whistle blew, and a train rushed out from a bend about six hundred meters away. The woman had already stepped off the tracks, but the little girl was still standing in the middle. My squad leader and I saw the danger and shouted at the child. The child, seeing the train approaching and hearing the shouts behind, stood still and cried. The woman was also frightened and did not know what to do. The train continued towards the child, and it was clear that it was only about three hundred meters away from the child.

At this moment, Chairman Mao's words flashed in my mind: "Resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The glorious image of Cai Yongxiang also appeared in my mind. Without hesitation, I rushed towards the train with my gun. Time is victory; I raced against the train, racing against time. I had to get in front of the train and win. In this short time, I rushed forward, picked up the child, and just jumped off the tracks as the train rushed past like a gust of wind. The child tightly hugged me, and we both escaped safely.

The child was Wu Aqing, the daughter of Wu Asun, a poor peasant from the first production brigade of Lianzhuang Production Team, Puxiang Commune, Xiaoshan County. The whole family, to express their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army, changed Aqing's name to Aijun. The commune party committee secretary led more than three hundred commune members to the company to visit us. The CPC Xiaoshan County Committee, the county people's government, and the county military affairs department sent comrades to the company to visit us and conducted extensive propaganda throughout Xiaoshan County. The Party and the higher-ups also praised me. The Party and the people gave me such high honors, and I felt uneasy in my heart. I only did a little of what a soldier of the people should do. The honor should go to the Party, to Chairman Mao. Many comrades asked me why I was so brave and fearless. My answer is that Chairman Mao taught me to do so, that the heroes inspired me to do so, and that Cai Yongxiang encouraged me to do so.

### 听毛主席的话　走英雄的道路

    听毛主席的话　走英雄的道路
    浙江省军区某部战士　夏英敏
    十月十日这一天，是我终身难忘的一天，是我生活道路上的新起点，是我思想革命化的里程碑。这一天，我的同乡、同时入伍、同在一个班里当战士，同学习、同执勤、同劳动了八个月的亲密战友，蔡永祥同志牺牲了！
    蔡永祥同志牺牲后的那几天，我心里很沉痛。我为失去这样一位好同志而难过，也为有这样一位好同志而感到自豪。毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”蔡永祥同志按照毛主席指示办事，是毛主席的好战士，他的死，死得其所，比泰山还重。我决心向他学习，化悲痛为力量。
    蔡永祥同志的牺牲，触动了我的灵魂深处。我反复地学习了和蔡永祥同志生前经常一起学习的《为人民服务》，想想蔡永祥同志在生活实践中是怎样执行的，在紧要关头是怎样实践的；比比我自己是怎样想的，是怎样做的。终于，我悟出了一个看来平时懂，而在实际上并不懂的道理：英雄的行为，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。只有在平时是一个
  “完全”、“彻底”无私的人，在紧要关头才能够是一个“完全”、“彻底”无畏的人；只有敢于以彻底革命精神炸碎个人主义的顽固的碉堡，才能做一个“完全”、“彻底”无私的人。我想通了这个道理，找到了差距，看清了方向，顿时觉得浑身是劲，更加坚定了信念：听毛主席的话，沿着英雄的路走，“完全”、“彻底”为人民，海枯石烂不变心。
    十月十二日中午，我怀着对英雄蔡永祥同志的无限崇敬的心情，再次学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”我暗暗地对自己说：“夏英敏，你要记住：蔡永祥同志，踏着革命烈士的血迹，按照许多英雄的榜样，用生命表现了他的赤胆忠心。现在你也要牢记毛主席的教导，掩埋好同志的尸体，擦干身上的血迹，继续战斗下去！”
    一场严重的考验发生了。十月十二日下午二点，我上了岗，站在七号哨位，也就是蔡永祥同志牺牲时所站的那个哨位。三点二十分左右，也就是蔡永祥同志牺牲后的六十一个小时，我发现离我八十五米的铁轨上，也就是离蔡永祥同志牺牲地点不远的地方，一个妇女双手抱着两个小孩，后面跟着一个小女孩，正在穿过轨道。就在这时，突然一声长笛，一辆列车从离我六百多米的一个转弯处，急速地驰来。只见那妇女已走下铁轨，但那个女孩还站在铁轨中间。我同领班员见情况危急，就拚命地向小孩呼喊。谁知小孩看看前面迎头奔来的火车，听到后面的急声叫喊，就站在原地大哭起来。那个妇女，也吓得不知所措。火车继续直往孩子的方向奔来，眼看距孩子只有三百米左右了。
    这时，毛主席的话在我的脑子里闪过：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”蔡永祥同志的光辉形象也出现在我的脑子里。我毫不犹豫地持枪迎着火车冲了过去。时间就是胜利，我和火车赛跑，我和火车在争时间。我一定要跑到火车的前面，一定要争取胜利。就在这很短的时间内，我跑过去一把抱起小孩，刚跳出轨道，列车像疾风一样从我身旁奔驰而过。孩子紧紧扑在我的怀里，我和小孩安全脱险了。
    这小孩叫吴阿琴，是萧山县浦沿公社联庄大队第一生产队贫农社员吴阿顺的女儿。小孩的全家为了感谢我们人民解放军，给阿琴改名为爱军。公社党委书记，还带领三百多名社员，到连队来慰问。中共萧山县委、县人民委员会和县人民武装部的同志专程到连队来看望我们，并在萧山全县进行广泛的宣传。党和上级也表扬我。党和人民群众，给了我这样高的荣誉，我从内心里感到不安。其实我只是做了一个人民战士应该做的一点事。荣誉应该归功于党，归功于毛主席。许多同志问我，为什么会这样勇敢，不怕死。我的回答是毛主席教导我这样做的，是英雄们激励我这样做的，是蔡永祥同志鼓舞着我这样做的。（附图片）
