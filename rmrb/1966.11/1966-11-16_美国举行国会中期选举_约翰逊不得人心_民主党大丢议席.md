U.S. midterm congressional elections were held on November 8. The Democratic Party, one of the two major parties representing the monopolistic capitalist clique in power, lost many seats in the election. This reflects the growing opposition within the country to the reactionary policies of the Johnson administration, which oppresses its own people domestically and aggressively expands abroad.

In the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats were up for election, the Democrats' majority decreased from 295 to 248, losing 47 seats, while the Republicans gained 187 seats. In the Senate, where 35 of the 100 seats were up for election, the Democrats' majority decreased from 67 to 64, while the Republicans increased their seats from 33 to 36.

In addition to the full or partial election of members of both houses of Congress, 35 of the 50 state governors were up for election. The results showed that the number of Democratic governors decreased from 33 to 26.

    美国举行国会中期选举
    约翰逊不得人心
    民主党大丢议席
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国在八日举行了国会中期选举，正在当政的垄断资本集团两大政党之一的民主党，在选举中丢掉了不少议席，这反映了约翰逊政府执行的对内奴役本国人民，对外进行侵略扩张的反动政策，在国内受到越来越强烈的反对。
    在众议院全部四百三十五名议员的选举中，民主党由原来占有的二百九十五席下降到二百四十八席，失掉了四十七席，共和党得到一百八十七席；在全部一百名参议员中，今年轮到改选的是三十五名。连任和改选后的名额分配是，民主党由原来的六十七席减少到六十四席，共和党由三十三席增加到三十六席。
    除了国会两院全部或部分议员的改选外，在全国五十名州长中还有三十五名进行了改选。选举的结果民主党占有的州长职位由原来的三十三下降到二十六。
