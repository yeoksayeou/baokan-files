Title: Break Private Interests, Establish Public Spirit, Revolutionize the Heart
Author: Cai Yongxiang
Date: 1966-11-18
Edition: 3

The editorial board of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* presents to our readers excerpts from the study notes and diaries of Comrade Cai Yongxiang, who has been diligently studying Chairman Mao's works.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang has only attended school for a little over two years. In studying Chairman Mao's works, he encounters many words he does not recognize; in writing his study notes and diaries, he encounters many words he does not know how to write. However, he has an infinite love for Chairman Mao and an infinite loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. With an unyielding revolutionary will and astonishing revolutionary resolve, in the eight months since he enlisted, he has written over 20,000 words of study notes and diaries.

Out of the 20,000-plus words in his notes and diaries, nearly 10,000 words are reflections on the study of the "Three Articles." He truly treats the "Three Articles" as his guiding principles, studying and applying them repeatedly. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," he wages a revolution in the depths of his soul. These notes and diaries are records of his frequent self-criticisms based on the "Three Articles"; they are a true reflection of his efforts to break private interests and establish public spirit in his thoughts.

These study notes and diaries shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought; they are filled with the revolutionary passion of proletarian fighters; every line and word pulsates with a heart dedicated to the public good.

In compiling Comrade Cai Yongxiang's study notes and diaries, we have made some deletions. For the convenience of the readers, we have corrected misspellings and added subheadings by category.

	In my heart, there is a red sun in the sky, shining brightly,
	I stand on the bridge looking towards Beijing.
	I see the Tiananmen Gate in Beijing,
	Chairman Mao is our great savior.

		March 7, 1966

Chairman Mao's words are the truth, one sentence is worth ten thousand. I will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever Chairman Mao says, I will do. I will truly master Mao Zedong Thought and become a good soldier who fears neither hardship nor death, dedicated to the revolution.

		June ×, 1966

Chairman Mao! You are dearer to me than my own parents. Your thoughts are redder than the sun. The sun nurtures my growth, and I will always listen to your words, carrying the revolution to the end.

		July 29, 1966

Chairman Mao swims the Yangtze River... Our great leader is in such good health, which is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the world. I sincerely wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

		Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!

		April 4, 1966

Only by studying Chairman Mao's works can one have correct thoughts. Without studying Chairman Mao's works, one will lose direction. Chairman Mao's works are a treasure; studying them opens one's mind.

		September 1966

Today, I listened to a report by a comrade-in-arms of Liu Yingjun, which greatly inspired me. Liu Yingjun's life was a life of studying Chairman Mao's works and serving the people wholeheartedly. We must learn from Liu Yingjun, mainly by learning to study, execute, propagate, and defend the highest directives, making the study of Chairman Mao's books a lifelong battle task. We must learn from his clear class standpoint, learning and applying in struggle.

		March 9, 1966

The Party assigns me wherever I go, and I will take Mao Zedong Thought with me.

		Fight Private Thoughts

		The "Three Articles" are treasures,
		Every sentence is good;
		Workers, peasants, and soldiers cannot do without them,
		The more you study, the brighter your eyes, the more you study, the more enlightened you become.

		Martyr's Legacy
		March ×, 1966

Before enlisting, I had many thoughts, wanting to be a technical soldier so I could operate machinery at home... I didn't think about the collective, I didn't think about the revolution. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I deeply realize that doing the revolution means fearing neither hardship nor death. I want to learn from Zhang Zedong, Dong Cunrui, Yang Rensheng, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie's communist spirit.

		March 8, 1966

		...Through studying the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I deeply feel that I am a soldier for the people, fighting for the people. I want to learn better from Comrade Lei Feng, learning his communist spirit and selflessness; I want to learn from Comrade Zhang Zedong, a communist who endured the Long March of 25,000 li... Later, he sacrificed himself. I want to learn his communist spirit. The Party assigns me wherever I go, and I will go. I want to be like Comrade Wang Jie, fearing neither hardship nor death, dedicating everything to the Party and the people.

		April 11, 1966

Studying "Serve the People" makes me realize that transforming one's thoughts is a long-term process. In daily life, class struggle is still sharp. The issue of whether to be selfless or selfish is constantly struggling in my mind, sometimes very intensely. Heroes can take pride in hardship, but I... sometimes avoid heavy work. This goes against Chairman Mao's teachings. In the future, I will take on heavy tasks at work and align with the lowest standards in life. Only in this way can I transform my thoughts well.

		March 7, 1966

		"Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism. No matter who points out our mistakes, we should welcome it." This is what Chairman Mao said. When I was at home, I couldn't stand being criticized. This was completely wrong. After coming to the unit, I followed Chairman Mao's words. If I make a mistake, I am not afraid of being criticized.

		March 30, 1966

On the 19th of this month, I had an argument with an old comrade in my class about a duty roster. This habit comes from home. Chairman Mao said: "If there is a problem, correct it; if there is none, strive for more." This made me deeply realize that the opinions comrades have of me, if they are right, I will definitely correct them; if they are wrong, I will firmly not argue with them. I want to learn from Comrade Lei Feng, treating comrades like the warmth of spring, achieving unity with new comrades and respecting old comrades.

		May ×, 1966

The leadership praised me, and I thought, being praised now does not mean future work will be good. In the future, I will dedicate myself wholeheartedly to serving the people, achieving consistency between words and deeds, being sincere and diligent, and making more contributions to the Party and the people.

		July 2, 1966

Studying the article "Put Down Your Burdens and Start the Machine" makes me deeply realize that in daily life, work, and study, people often carry various burdens, big and small. Old burdens are put down, new burdens keep appearing. How to solve these problems? Seek solutions in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's works are priceless treasures that can solve any problem.

		May 28, 1966

Through studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the relationship between internal and external factors, I clearly realize: If a pumpkin seed is rotten inside, no matter how you plant it, it won't sprout! If a person's thoughts are bad, how can they work well?

		I must be like Yu Gong, determined, fearless of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory.

		July 17, 1966

I cannot be fixated on personal honors, fearing gain and loss. If so, it is a manifestation of bourgeois individualism. Comrade Wang Jie said: "A vain person looks at their own name; a glorious person looks at the country's cause!" I want to learn from Comrade Wang Jie, correctly handling the issue of honors. I want to strive for excellence in revolution, striving for the revolutionization of thoughts. I want to diligently study Chairman Mao's works, truly doing as Chairman Mao says. Dare to put oneself in it, expose one's thoughts, and fight against private thoughts, making Mao Zedong Thought gradually take root in one's mind. In this way, I will definitely advance victoriously on the path of revolutionization!

		August 26, 1966

I have read the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" several times and feel that Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true. A person should live like Comrade Norman Bethune, dedicating their entire life and energy to the cause of human liberation and communism.

		June 20, 1966

In my work, I have achieved a small success, which entirely belongs to the Party and the people, to the comrades. I still have many shortcomings and mistakes, and I must learn from the comrades, comparing my shortcomings with others' strengths, making myself progress continuously, and strictly demanding of myself.

		October ×, 1966

I have the following reflections on studying Chairman Mao's works:

		Liberalism kills people.
		Criticism is the greatest class love.
		Fight against private thoughts.
		Fight against the "I."
		Dig deep into private thoughts.
		With Mao Zedong Thought, even if the sky falls, I dare to prop it up.
		Politically, always set high standards; in life, always set low standards.
		Be a revolutionary "old yellow cow."

		I study Chairman Mao's works,
		I think of the revolution.
		I do revolution for the people,
		I want to be an unnamed hero.

		Martyr's Legacy
		June 14, 1966

I have repeatedly studied "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao told me: "...A person may have great or small abilities, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a noble person, a pure person, a person of morality, a person free from vulgar interests, a person beneficial to the people." I will remember Chairman Mao's teachings and be a revolutionary "old yellow cow."

		March 21, 1966

Through studying "Serve the People," I have clarified my direction. On the evening of the 21st, I stood guard. It had rained heavily, and the thunder was loud. I wore a raincoat and went on duty. I stood by the riverbank without entering the guardhouse. Later, the platoon leader came to inspect the guard, saw that I was all wet, and told me to go to the guardhouse. I replied, what is a little hardship for the revolution!

		April 11, 1966

During my rest time, I went to the north end to carry night soil. Carrying night soil is also serving the people. I didn't think this way before. At that time, I thought night soil was so smelly, and when others carried it, I ran far away. Through studying "Serve the People," I deeply realized that it is not the night soil that is smelly, but my thoughts. I will use Mao Zedong Thought to cleanse my thoughts.

		May 8, 1966

Today, I came to the lakeside, and an old lady wanted to go to the Six Harmonies Pagoda, but she had no money. I saw this and bought a ticket for her. The old lady was very moved on the spot and asked where I was from. The service staff on the bus also asked my name. I replied, I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. The old lady said, you are a good comrade! I replied to the old lady, Chairman Mao is really good! I then walked back to the company. I did a good deed and felt happy.

		May 30, 1966

I came to the sluice gate and saw workers carrying coal. I thought of the workers building socialism and then of Lei Feng, so I started doing voluntary labor to help the workers. The more I worked, the more energetic I felt, working for two and a half hours. I was very happy because this is doing revolution, building socialism.

		June 17, 1966

Today, it rained heavily. This week, our class is responsible for carrying water. Several comrades in our class are not in good health. Thinking of this, I took the water bucket and carried it alone. The road was slippery, and I fell four times in the afternoon. I exerted some effort for the revolution and felt comfortable. Being able to let the comrades rest more, I felt very happy. Contributing my strength to the revolution and the people, I felt blessed.

		August 4, 1966

I am a revolutionary and must remember Chairman Mao's words, being a servant of the people, a nameless hero. For the revolution, if there is a spark of heat, let it shine. I will not disappoint the Party's cultivation of me and the comrades' help. Stand at the forefront of class struggle. Mao Zedong Thought shines like gold, illuminating the soldiers' hearts, standing firmly on the class standpoint, daring to face even if the sky falls!

		Martyr's Legacy
		April ×, 1966

Studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and visiting the class education exhibition, I realized that in the old society where people eat people, where is the way for the poor? In the old society, my family also suffered. My mother worked as a servant for the landlord from a young age and was driven out by the landlord's wife at the age of fourteen. Now, there are still many oppressed people in the world living worse than cattle. Domestically, there are still landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. I must remember the bitterness of class struggle, never forget the blood debt, and never forget class struggle.

		April 20, 1966

After socialist education, I realized that the class struggle at home and abroad is extremely sharp and complex. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are competing for the younger generation. They use various bourgeois ideas to corrupt the youth, hoping to place their hopes for counter-revolutionary restoration on the degeneration of the youth. Individualism is precisely the gap they want to use. If one does not pay attention to transformation, then under certain conditions, one's thoughts will inevitably rot and decay, eventually becoming a captive of bourgeois ideas. I deeply feel that studying Chairman Mao's works must thoroughly transform one's worldview.

		May 28, 1966

I will never forget class struggle, standing on the bridge, looking at all of China, with the world in my heart.

		April 11, 1966

I will not fear great winds and waves, standing in front of the enemy, fighting to the end. Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are truly reliable, true gold is not afraid of fire.

		× Month, 1966

Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our revolution. Whoever dares to oppose it, smash them to pieces.

		June 21, 1966

This Cultural Revolution is a practical test for every comrade. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works better, not only holding the gun but also the pen, fighting against anti-Party elements, defending the Party Central Committee, and defending Chairman Mao.

		× Month, 1966

This Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between Mao Zedong Thought and bourgeois ideas. In this struggle, I will dedicate everything to the Party and the people.

		August ×, 1966

Today, I heard the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which gave me great strength, making me love the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao even more. To do a good job in work and political study, I make the following resolutions:

		1. Diligently study Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the use of words, like Liu Yingjun, studying, executing, propagating, and defending the highest directives.

		2. Actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, firmly standing at the forefront of the struggle, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, not resting until complete victory. At the same time, test myself in the struggle.

		3. Oppose American imperialism and modern revisionism.

		4. Train combat skills, contributing all my strength and precious youth to defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and support world revolution.

		5. Actively participate in socialist construction, striving to the end, carrying forward the glorious traditions of the Red Army, serving the people wholeheartedly.

		The above is my resolution. Let the Party branch see my actions!

### 破私立公一心革命——蔡永祥同志学习心得笔记日记摘抄

专栏：

    破私立公一心革命
    ——蔡永祥同志学习心得笔记日记摘抄
    《解放军报》编者按：我们满怀崇敬的心情，向读者推荐蔡永祥同志学习毛主席著作的部分心得笔记和日记。
    蔡永祥同志只读过两年多书，他学习毛主席著作，有很多字不认识；写心得笔记和日记，有很多字不会写。但是，他无限热爱毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想，以顽强的革命意志，惊人的革命毅力，在入伍后的八个月中，写下了两万多字的心得笔记和日记。
    蔡永祥同志两万多字的笔记和日记中，有近一万字是学习“老三篇”的心得体会。他真正把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，反复学，反复用。他用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，在灵魂深处大闹革命。这些笔记和日记，是他经常对照“老三篇”进行“思想讲评”的记录；是他在思想上破私立公的真实写照。
    这些心得笔记和日记，闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉；洋溢着无产阶级战士的革命激情；字里行间跳动着一心为公的一颗红心。
    我们在编选蔡永祥同志的心得笔记和日记时，作了一些删节。为了使读者看起来方便，改掉了错别字，分类加上了小标题。心中有颗红太阳天上星，亮晶晶，我在大桥望北京。望到北京天安门，毛主席是我们的大救星。
                                烈士遗作
                一九六六年三月七日
    毛主席的话句句是真理，一句抵一万句。我要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做，真正把毛主席的思想学到手，做个不怕苦、不怕死，一心为革命的好战士。
                一九六六年六月×日
    毛主席呵！你老人家真比我父母还亲。你的思想比太阳还要红。太阳培育我成长，我永远听你老人家的话，把革命进行到底。
              一九六六年七月二十九日
    毛主席畅游长江……我们伟大的领袖身体这样健康，真是我们全中国人民和全世界人民最大的幸福。
    衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
    毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
                一九六六年四月四日
    只有学习毛主席著作，才能有高度的正确思想。不学毛主席著作，就会迷失方向；毛主席著作是个宝，一学就开窍。
                  一九六六年九月
    今天听了刘英俊同志生前战友的报告，在思想上有了很大的启发。刘英俊的一生，就是学习毛主席著作的一生，全心全意为人民服务的一生。我们要学习刘英俊，主要是学习他那样，学习最高指示，执行最高指示，宣传最高指示，捍卫最高指示，把读毛主席的书，当作毕生的战斗任务。学习他明确的阶级观点，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。
                一九六六年三月九日
    党把我分配到那里，我就把毛泽东思想带到那里。
    私心杂念要猛斗
      “老三篇”，是法宝，
    句句内容好；
    工农兵，不可少，
    越学眼越亮，越学越开窍。
                                      烈士遗作
                一九六六年三月×日
    我没有入伍前有很多想法，想当个技术兵，回家可以开机器。……就没有想到集体，没有想到革命。我通过学习毛主席著作，深深想到干革命就不怕苦，不怕死，我要学习张思德、董存瑞、杨根思、黄继光、雷锋、王杰他们的共产主义风格。
                一九六六年三月八日
    ……我通过学习《为人民服务》这篇文章，深深体会到，我是为人民当兵，为人民打仗的。我要更好地向雷锋同志学习，学习他共产主义风格，学习他毫不利己专门利人；我要学习张思德同志，他是个共产党员，经过二万五千里长征，……后来，他牺牲了，我要学习他共产主义风格，党分配我到那里，我就到那里。我要像王杰同志那样，一不怕苦，二不怕死，把我的一切献给党和人民。
              一九六六年四月十一日
    学习《为人民服务》，使我认识到，人的思想改造是长期的。在日常生活中，阶级斗争还是尖锐的。一心为公还是一心为私的问题，在我头脑里是经常在斗争，有时斗争还非常激烈。英雄人物能以苦为荣，而我呢？却有些拈轻怕重。这是违背毛主席教导的。今后，在工作中要拣重活干，在生活上要向最低的同志看齐。只有这样，才能很好改造自己的思想。
                一九六六年三月七日
      “因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。”这是毛主席说的。我在家的时候，人家讲我就不行。这是完全错误的。我来到部队以后，就照毛主席的话去做了。有了错误，就不怕别人批评。
              一九六六年三月三十日
    本月十九日，我和班里的老同志为了勤务牌子吵了嘴。我这种作风是从家里带来的。毛主席说：“有则改之，无则加勉”。使我深深地想到，同志们对我提出的意见，对，我一定改正，一定照他的办；不对，我坚决不和他争吵。我要向雷锋同志学习，对待同志要像春天般的温暖，做到团结新同志，尊重老同志。
                一九六六年五月×日
    领导上表扬我，我想，现在受表扬不等于今后工作好。今后要做到一心一意为人民服务，做到言行一致，表里如一，埋头苦干，踏踏实实，为党为人民做出更多的贡献。
                一九六六年七月二日
    学习《放下包袱，开动机器》一文，使我深深地体会到，在日常生活、工作、学习中，人往往背着一些大大小小形形色色的包袱，旧的包袱放下，新的包袱又不断地出现。这些问题如何解决呢？就找毛主席著作去解决。毛主席著作是无价宝，任何问题都能解决。
              一九六六年五月二十八日
    通过学习毛主席关于内因和外因的关系的教导，我明确认识到：一个南瓜种，要是里头坏了，放到土里，你叫它怎么能发芽啊！人的思想有了不好的东西，你叫他怎么能很好地工作呢？
    我一定要像愚公那样，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。
              一九六六年七月十七日
    我不能在个人荣誉上打圈子，患得患失。如果那样，就是资产阶级个人主义思想。王杰同志说：“虚荣的人注视着自己的名字；光荣的人注视着祖国的事业！”我要向王杰同志学习，正确对待荣誉问题。我要为革命争五好，为实现思想革命化争五好。我要努力学习毛主席著作，真正做到毛主席怎么说的，我就怎么做。敢于把自己摆进去，把思想亮出来，同私心杂念作斗争，使毛泽东思想逐步在自己头脑里扎根。这样，我一定能在革命化的道路上胜利前进！
              一九六六年八月二十六日
    《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，我又反复地读了几遍，我感到毛主席的话是千真万确的真理。一个人活着，就应该像白求恩同志那样，把自己的毕生精力和整个生命，为人类的解放事业共产主义全部献出。
              一九六六年六月二十日
      我在工作中有了一点小小的成绩，这完全属于党和人民，属于同志们。我还存在不少缺点和错误，自己一定要向同志们学习，拿自己的缺点和别人的优点比，使自己不断前进，严格要求自己。
                一九六六年十月×日
    学习毛主席著作有以下几点体会：
      自由主义害死人。
    批评是最大的阶级友爱。
      私心杂念要猛斗。
      “我”字要狠斗，斗倒，斗垮。
      私心要深挖。
    有了毛泽东思想，天塌下来也敢顶。
    政治上要永远高标准，生活上要永远低标准。
    甘当革命的“老黄牛”
    我学的是毛主席著作，
    我想的是革命。
    我为人民干革命，
    我要争当无名英雄。
                                    烈士遗作
              一九六六年六月十四日
    我反复学习了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》，毛主席告诉我：“……一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”我要牢记毛主席的教导，做革命的“老黄牛”。
              一九六六年三月二十一日
    通过学习《为人民服务》，使我明确了方向。我在二十一日晚上，站头班岗。正是下了一场很大的雨，雷也很响。我穿了一件雨衣就去上岗了。我站在江边，没有进岗楼，后来指导员来查岗，他看我的身上全湿了，指导员叫我到岗楼去，我回答，为革命吃点苦算什么！
              一九六六年四月十一日
    我在休息的时候到北头挑大粪。挑大粪也是为人民服务。我过去就不是这样想的。那时我想大粪这么臭，人家在挑，我就跑得很远。通过学习《为人民服务》，深深地认识到，不是粪臭，而是我的思想臭。我以毛泽东思想来洗洗我的思想。
                一九六六年五月八日
    我今天出院来到湖滨，有个老大娘要到六和塔去，可是她没有钱，我看到了就买了一张票给她。这个老妈妈当场非常感动，问我是那个地方的，车上的服务员也问我叫什么名字，我回答说，我是中国人民解放军。老妈妈说，你这个同志可真好啊！我回答大娘说，毛主席可真好呢！我后来步行回到连队。我做了一点好事，感到高兴。
              一九六六年五月三十日
    我来到闸口，看到工人在挑煤。我想，工人们是为社会主义建设，我又想到雷锋，就帮助工人做起义务劳动来。我越干越有劲，一直干了两个半钟头。我很快活，因为这样是干革命，是建设社会主义。一九六六年六月十七日
    今天下大雨。这个星期是我们班挑水。我们班几个同志身体不太好。我想到这里，就拿水桶一个人挑了。路很滑，我挑了一个下午，摔了四跤。我为革命出了点力气，感到舒服。能让同志们多休息一点，我感到十分高兴。我为革命、为人民贡献自己一分力量，感到幸福。
  一九六六年八月四日
    我是一个革命者，要牢记毛主席的话，做人民的勤务员，甘当无名英雄。为革命，有一点热就发一点光。决不辜负党对我的培养，不辜负同志们对我的帮助。站在阶级斗争的最前列毛主席著作闪金光，照得战士心里亮，阶级立场站得稳，天塌地裂也敢上！烈士遗作
                一九六六年四月×日
    学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，看了阶级教育展览馆，使我认识到，人吃人的旧社会，哪里有我们穷人的活路。旧社会里，我们家也是受苦，母亲从小给地主当佣人，十四岁就被地主婆子赶出了门。现在世界上还有广大被压迫人民没有解放，他们过着牛马不如的生活。国内还有地富反坏右分子。我要牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，千万不可忘记阶级斗争。
                一九六六年四月二十日
    社会主义教育以后，我认识到，今天国内外的阶级斗争是极为尖锐复杂的，帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，都在争夺青年一代。他们用形形色色的资产阶级思想来腐蚀青年，企图把反革命复辟的希望寄托在青年一代的变质上，而个人主义思想正是他们要利用的一个缺口，如果不注意改造，那么，在一定条件下，自己的思想必然会发臭发霉，以至堕落成为资产阶级的俘虏。我深深的体会到，学习毛主席著作，必须彻底地改造自己的世界观。
              一九六六年五月二十八日
    我要永远不忘阶级斗争，站在大桥上，眼看全中国，心怀全球。
              一九六六年四月十一日
    我一定不怕大风大浪，站在敌人面前，和他战斗到底。用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士就是过硬，真金不怕火来炼。
                  一九六六年×月
    毛泽东思想是我们革命的命根子。
    谁敢反对，就把他砸个粉碎。
              一九六六年六月二十一日
    这次文化大革命，对我们每个同志来说，是一次最实际的锻炼。我今后一定要更好地学习毛主席著作，不但拿好枪杆子，而且要拿起笔杆子，和反党分子进行斗争，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席。
                一九六六年×月×日
    这次文化大革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级你死我活的斗争，也就是毛泽东思想和资产阶级思想的一场斗争。在这场斗争中，我要把自己的一切献给党和人民。
                一九六六年八月×日
    今天听到中央人民广播电台广播八届十一中全会公报，给了我很大力量，使我更加热爱伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席。为了搞好工作和政治学习，特表以下决心：
    一，努力学习毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，像刘英俊那样，学习最高指示，执行最高指示，宣传最高指示，捍卫最高指示。
    二，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，坚决走在斗争的最前列，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，不获全胜，决不收兵。同时在斗争中考验自己。
    三，反对美帝国主义必须反对现代修正主义。
    苦练杀敌本领，为保卫祖国、解放台湾和支援世界革命，贡献出自己的一切力量和宝贵青春。
