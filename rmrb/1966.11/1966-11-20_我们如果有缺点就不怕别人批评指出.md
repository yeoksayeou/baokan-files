For a period, the relationship between our coal yard and the nearby residents was not good. The residents near the coal yard complained that the coal yard affected the environmental sanitation, and they had many complaints. The children of the residents often played and knocked down the coal piles, and our workers were also very troubled, often arguing with the residents. How to resolve this contradiction? Comrades proposed to request funds from higher authorities to build a wall, "With a wall, no matter how we dump coal, residents won't be able to find fault, and children won't be able to come and play, avoiding arguments and quarrels." I also thought the same way. Once, I watched the movie "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" and saw the soldiers helping porters push carts, helping farmers transplant rice and harvest wheat, assisting factories, and cleaning streets for residents. Seeing the scenes of soldiers loving the people and the people loving the soldiers in the movie, I was greatly inspired. Why can't we learn from the spirit of the soldiers? But then I thought, they are the army, and our business is different from theirs. We work with shovels all day, and we don't have time to do those things. Thinking this way and that way, I always felt that the matter was difficult to handle.

I brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works. In his essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao said: "Our army is a people's army. It belongs to the people. Whatever the people have, we have; whatever the people lack, we lack." Comparing and reflecting, my thoughts became clear, and I organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to correct everyone's attitude. I proposed that our past attitude towards the masses was not good, and to improve the relationship, we should first go to the masses to apologize. Some comrades did not agree to go, saying, "Cold face meets hot face, it's not worth the effort." To unify our understanding, I organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. Chairman Mao said: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism if we have flaws. No matter who points out our flaws, we should correct them if they are right." Chairman Mao's teachings gave us a golden key to improving our relationship with the masses, making our thoughts even clearer.

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we visited more than thirty households. The masses saw that we came to seek their opinions and were very enthusiastic, offering tea and cigarettes, and did not mention the arguments anymore. That day, after the visit, I felt that Chairman Mao's words were indeed the truth, and following Chairman Mao's instructions was correct. I told my comrades: Originally, we often argued and quarreled with others, but after visiting, they treated us very well. The problem is how we serve the people.

From that day on, the comrades in our coal yard organized themselves to continuously go out to serve the masses, insisting on cleaning the streets for the residents near the coal yard every day, cleaning the coal slag that had been piled at the residents' doors for many years, and removing the garbage. We found that more than twenty households had problems with their stoves, so we brought mud, sand, and cement to help repair them. We also actively helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who lacked labor to carry water on windy and rainy days. The residents were very moved, saying that we are "good workers educated by Chairman Mao." They also treated the coal yard as their own and the coal yard workers as their own family, managing the coal yard's affairs and actively helping to guard the coal. My comrades no longer mentioned building a wall.

    我们如果有缺点就不怕别人批评指出
    武汉市煤建公司红心煤栈组长　胡承东
    有一个时期，我们煤栈和附近居民的关系，搞得不太好。煤栈附近的居民反映煤栈影响环境卫生，对我们意见很大。居民的小孩玩的时候经常扒垮了煤堆，我们职工也很头疼，经常跟居民吵吵闹闹。怎么解决这个矛盾？同志们提出要上级拨经费，砌围墙，“有了围墙，不管我们怎么倒煤，居民也找不上，小孩也没法来玩了，免得扯皮吵架。”我也是这样想。有一次我看了《南京路上好八连》的电影，看到解放军帮助搬运工人推板车，帮农民栽秧割麦，为工厂帮忙，给居民打扫街道。看到电影中军爱民、民爱军的情景，我思想上受到很大启发。我们为什么不能学解放军同志的这种精神呢？但又一想，他们是军队，我们的业务与他们不同，一天到黑拿锹干活，没有空搞那些事情。这样正一想，反一想，总觉得事情难办。
    我带着这个问题，向毛主席著作请教。毛主席在《为人民服务》一文中说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”一对照检查，思想开了窍，我就组织大家学习《为人民服务》，端正大家的态度。我提出过去对群众态度不好，要搞好关系，首先就应该到群众中去赔礼道歉。一部分同志不同意去，说什么“冷脸挨热脸，吃力不讨好”。为了统一认识，我再次组织大家学习《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”毛主席的教导，给了我们一把搞好群众关系的金钥匙，使我们的思想进一步开了窍。
    我们遵循着毛主席的这一指示，访问了三十多户居民。群众见我们是来征求意见的，热情得很，端茶拿烟，也不提吵架的事了。当天访问回来，我就觉得毛主席的话真是千真万确的真理，照毛主席的指示办事一点没错，我就跟同志们说：原来经常与别人吵嘴、扯皮，访问一下，人家对我们还是蛮好，问题是看我们如何为人民服务。
    从这一天起，我们煤栈的同志们就自动组织起来，不断走出煤栈为群众服务，坚持每天帮煤栈附近居民打扫街道，把许多年堆在居民门口的煤渣子打扫得干干净净，垃圾也拖走了。发现有二十多户居民用的炉子有毛病，我们就带着黄泥、沙子、水泥去帮助修理。还主动在刮风下雨天，给缺少劳力的烈军属挑水。居民很感动，说我们是“毛主席教育出来的好工人”。他们也把煤栈当成自己的煤栈，把煤栈职工当成自己的亲人，煤栈的事情他们帮着管，并且主动帮助看护煤炭。同志们再也不提砌围墙的事了。
