Our country's successful test launch of a nuclear missile has dealt a heavy blow to the two nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, leaving them dazed and bewildered.

When Washington was planning Johnson's Asian tour, they were already worried about China conducting a nuclear test. According to Western news agencies, the United States estimated that China might conduct another nuclear test in November. Therefore, Johnson rushed to Asia in October. However, just as Johnson concluded the Manila meeting and began his Asian tour, a thunderclap echoed, and China announced the successful test launch of a nuclear missile. For two whole days, Johnson was struck dumb, unable to utter a word. It was not until October 30 that he managed to feign composure and made a statement about China's test launch of a nuclear missile.

Johnson stammered that China is "a part of the underdeveloped world," that China is poor and should not develop nuclear weapons; that China developing nuclear weapons is "regrettable." Johnson put on a show of "concern" for the living conditions of the Chinese people, which is truly nauseating. The world's people clearly see that this country, which was once looked down upon by imperialism as poor and backward, has, once liberated, not only been able to live well but also to build atomic bombs and missiles, to scale the heights of science and technology, and to catch up with and surpass the Western powers. The miracle created by the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought has made all oppressed nations and peoples hold their heads high, and has made imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries around the world hang their heads in defeat. This is truly regrettable for Johnson.

Johnson further said that China having missiles and nuclear weapons "brings danger to China itself," because the United States can "contain" China. Johnson's attempt to intimidate China is truly laughable. The Chinese people were not afraid of American imperialism in the era of rifles and small amounts of rice; they were not afraid when the United States monopolized nuclear weapons; now that the Chinese people have their own missiles and nuclear weapons, are they going to be afraid of you? American imperialism has been "containing" China for seventeen years, but the more it "contains" China, the stronger China becomes. Today, is China still going to be afraid of your "containment"? Johnson's arguments are pure Al Qaeda logic. Johnson's big talk is merely a cover for his inner panic.

Johnson said that China's test launch of a nuclear missile has "greatly increased the difficulties" in signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is somewhat true. Currently, the American imperialist and Soviet revisionist leadership are vigorously pushing for a nuclear non-proliferation deal, attempting to consolidate their nuclear monopoly. China's successful test launch of a nuclear missile is a fatal blow to these two bad guys. What "preventing nuclear proliferation"? The Chinese people are determined to go against you and shatter this scheme. You want to issue a law that only allows you to have nuclear weapons and not others. We will now use the thunderous roar of nuclear explosions to respond to you. You have them, and we will definitely have them too. This is the law set by revolutionary people.

When Johnson came to Asia, the U.S. State Department had consulted the almanac and chosen an auspicious day for him. Who would have thought that during his "visit" to Asia, he would encounter China's test launch of a nuclear missile. This incident, though seemingly coincidental, has symbolic significance. It shows that in our era, imperialism can no longer have any auspicious days.

    约翰逊大倒其霉
    本报评论员
    我国发射导弹核武器试验成功，给了美苏两个核霸王以当头一棒，打得他们晕头转向、目瞪口呆。
    华盛顿在安排约翰逊亚洲之行的时候，就担心碰上中国的核爆炸。据西方通讯社透露，美国估计中国进行又一次核试验的时间，可能是十一月。因此，约翰逊才赶在十月份跑到亚洲来。但是，不迟不早，正当约翰逊开完马尼拉会议，开始他的亚洲之行的时候，一声惊雷，中国宣告发射导弹核武器试验成功。整整两天，约翰逊呆若木鸡，一句话也讲不出来。直到十月三十日，他才故作镇静地就中国发射导弹核武器，讲了一通话。
    约翰逊嗫嗫嚅嚅地说，中国是“不发达世界”的“一部分”，中国穷，不该搞核武器；中国搞核武器，是“可悲的”。约翰逊装出一副“关怀”中国人民生活的样子，实在令人作呕。世界人民都清楚地看到，中国这个过去被帝国主义瞧不起的贫穷落后的国家，一旦得到了彻底的解放，就不仅能够生活得好，而且能够造原子弹、造导弹，在科学技术的领域内攀登世界的高峰，赶上和超过西方大国。中国人民在毛泽东思想指导下创造的这一奇迹，使一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民扬眉吐气，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派垂头丧气。这对约翰逊来说，才真正是可悲的。
    约翰逊又说，中国有了导弹和核武器，“给中国本身招来了危险”，因为美国可以“遏制”中国。约翰逊装出一副吓唬中国的样子，实在令人可笑。中国人民在小米加步枪的时代，就没有怕过美帝国主义；在美国垄断核武器的时候，中国人民也没有怕过；现在中国人民自己掌握了导弹和核武器，难道反而会怕你吗？美帝国主义一直在“遏制”中国，“遏制”了十七年，可是，越“遏制”中国越强大，难道今天的中国，还会怕你的“遏制”吗？约翰逊的这一套论调，是十足的阿Q。约翰逊的大话，不过是掩饰自己内心的恐慌而已。
    约翰逊说，中国试验导弹核武器，给防止核扩散条约的签订“大大地增加了困难”。这倒是说得差不多。现在，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团正在起劲地大搞防止核扩散的交易，企图巩固它们的核垄断地位。中国发射导弹核武器试验成功，正是给了这两个坏家伙以致命的打击。什么“防止核扩散”，中国人民就是要造你们的反，破你们这个东西。你们想颁布一条法律，只许你们有，不许别人有。我们现在就是要用核爆炸的震天巨响来回敬你们。你们有，我们一定也要有。这是革命人民定下的法律。
    约翰逊到亚洲来的时候，美国国务院是给他查了皇历，择了吉日的。没有想到，他在亚洲的“访问”途中，遇到了中国发射导弹核武器。这件事，看起来是巧合，但具有象征性的意义。它表明，在我们的时代，帝国主义已经不可能有什么黄道吉日了。
