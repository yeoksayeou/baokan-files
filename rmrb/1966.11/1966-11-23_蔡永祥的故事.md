The first time I met Cai Yongxiang

After the news of Cai Yongxiang's heroic deed of rescuing and transporting the Red Guards' special train was published, many comrades who knew him or had met him once wrote articles recalling the hero and learning from him. These comrades mentioned that their first impression of Cai Yongxiang was very good. From these reflections, we can see that Cai Yongxiang's worldview of serving the public was cultivated in his daily work and life, following Chairman Mao's teachings, starting from small details.

The "self" cannot be removed from one's mind all at once, nor can the "public" be deeply rooted in one's mind all at once. When we learn from Cai Yongxiang, we should follow his example and start from small details in handling daily work and in all aspects of life, thoroughly removing the "self" and firmly establishing the "public."

A Lantern

A simple train loaded with our new soldiers was traveling from Anhui to Zhejiang. There were no electric lights in the car, and by evening, the car was dark. "Light!" With a burst of joyful shouts, the car was suddenly illuminated. We saw a short, stocky comrade lighting a lantern. We were all overjoyed and sat down to study. However, the train was speeding, and the lantern placed on the table jumped; hung on the wall, it swayed. This comrade stood in the middle of the car, holding the lantern high in one hand and holding the table with the other, letting the light evenly shine on every corner.

Many comrades rushed forward to take his place. Some said, "You've been working all day, you can't take it." He replied, "The people's bodies are made of iron." Others said, "You are young, ..." He said, "Revolution does not distinguish between old and young."

When the train stopped for a meal, I saw this comrade jump off the train first, busy fetching water and food. After the comrades finished eating, he ate. After the meal, he picked up a broom and swept the platform clean, then returned to the car to pick up the lantern.

It was late at night. This comrade covered his comrades with his quilt, gently placed the lantern in front of him, opened "In the Service of the People," and read it intently.

Later, I found out that this comrade's name was Cai Yongxiang. This was my first impression of Cai Yongxiang, and I never saw him again. When I heard the news of Cai Yongxiang's heroic sacrifice, his heroic image, like that lantern, was forever etched in my heart.

Recently, I often think: Cai Yongxiang's ability to sacrifice himself heroically in rescuing and transporting the Red Guards' special train is not something that suddenly appeared in the moment of sacrifice; rather, it is something he cultivated day by day in his daily work and life, following Chairman Mao's instructions. I will learn from Cai Yongxiang's noble quality of selflessness, starting from the spirit of "holding the lantern."

(Warrior Yu Lianjie)

Repairing the Pigsty

This summer was particularly hot. One day, I had business at the Third Company and passed by the pigsty. I saw a comrade with thick eyebrows and big eyes, barefoot and with sleeves rolled up, crawling into the smelly and dirty pigsty to repair it. Sweat and pig manure covered him, but he was still smiling and working hard. I was deeply moved. I thought, "I am also a feeder, but my work is not as good as his." I was about to praise him, but a comrade who came with me spoke first. He said, "This little feeder is amazing!" As soon as the words were out, a comrade from the Third Company came over and said, "He is not a feeder; he is our company's famous 'busy bee,' named Cai Yongxiang." I heard this and my face turned red. I thought, "I am a feeder, but I am afraid of the dirt and my work is not good, which is really not right."

I received a living education from Cai Yongxiang the first time I met him.

Recently, I read in the newspaper about Cai Yongxiang's heroic deed of sacrificing himself to rescue the Red Guards' special train and realized that Cai Yongxiang had a big "public" in his mind. Taking Cai Yongxiang as an example, I studied the "Three Articles" again and understood that raising pigs is also serving the people. Now, I am not afraid of dirt or hard work, and every day I clean the pigsty and feed the pigs well.

(Farmer Jiang Zhitian)

Saving Me from Danger

On a day in early July, our company had just returned from a mission outside and was carrying supplies. When I hoisted a very heavy package and was about to cross the railway near the Qiantang River Bridge, a train roared from afar. I was carrying heavy things and was tired, and suddenly hearing the train's roar, I was a bit stunned. At this critical moment, I saw a soldier rushing towards me, without a word, he took the package from my shoulders and quickly crossed the railway. I followed and crossed over. I thanked him sincerely, "Thank you!" Just as I was about to ask his name, he had already run away.

In mid-August, on a hot noon, I was carrying a bundle of mats and passed by the bridge again. At that time, sweat was pouring out of my face and body, and my hands were so sore that I could hardly hold the mats. Suddenly, someone behind me seemed to be helping me carry them, and I felt much lighter. I turned around to look: it was the comrade who had saved me from danger that day. I wanted to greet him, but he took out a handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to me, gesturing to wipe the sweat. I thought, "This comrade really cares more about others than himself!"

Later, I found out from other comrades that he was Cai Yongxiang.

(Air Force Warrior Cai Yingen)

Acting Selflessly in All Aspects

Many comrades recalled that Cai Yongxiang had a noble quality of selflessness. Below, we invite Cai Yongxiang's comrades to tell three small stories about Cai Yongxiang's selflessness. From these three stories, we can see that Cai Yongxiang indeed: prioritized helping others, prioritized revolutionary work, and prioritized national interests.

Prioritizing Helping Others

Our second platoon has a rule: each class takes turns fetching water for the kitchen in the morning, so the cooks can sleep a little longer.

This day, it was the turn of the fourth class to fetch water. As soon as they got up, the comrades rushed to the kitchen to grab the water buckets. When they got there, they saw that the water tank was already full. Everyone looked at each other, not knowing what was going on.

Only the warrior Zhang Zhengxue knew:

At three in the morning, Zhang Zhengxue was on duty. When he was patrolling by the river, he saw someone walking quickly to the river to fetch water. Under the searchlight, he recognized it was Cai Yongxiang, so he went over and asked, "Why aren't you sleeping?" Cai Yongxiang smiled and said, "I just got off duty, I don't want to sleep, I need something to do." Zhang Zhengxue said with concern, "You are fetching water alone, it's too tiring!" Cai Yongxiang shook his head, "It's okay if one person is tired, let the comrades rest more!"

The warrior known as "Little Tiger," Cai Yongxiang, carried the large water buckets from the river to the kitchen, running back and forth quickly for over an hour before the water tank was full. When it was almost dawn, he was busy cleaning again.

(Second Platoon Comrade)

Prioritizing Revolutionary Work

One evening in July, I returned to the dormitory after getting off duty and found that Cai Yongxiang's bed was still empty. "Hmm! Where did he go?" I went outside and saw a person sitting under the bridge, reading a book under the searchlight. I walked over and took a closer look, it was Cai Yongxiang. He was engrossed in reading, "Hard work is like a burden, placed in front of us, see if we dare to bear it..." Then, he started writing a happy note.

I softly said to him, "It's so late, why don't you sleep? Can't you study tomorrow?" Cai Yongxiang said seriously, "No, I have to study today. Today, I didn't do the heaviest work. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, this is not a good attitude. I have to change!"

The next day, it was labor again. Cai Yongxiang recited to everyone, "Hard work is like a burden..." This passage from Chairman Mao. Then, he took off his clothes and started working. Wherever there was heavy work, Cai Yongxiang appeared. Wherever there was difficulty, Cai Yongxiang rushed in.

I saw it in my heart and thought in my mind: a comrade like Cai Yongxiang, who puts revolutionary work first, dares to take on heavy burdens!

(Fourth Class Warrior Zhang Zhengxue)

Prioritizing National Interests

In September, it was the season of "green mountains and golden fields, thousands of acres of cotton fields with flying clouds." Cai Yongxiang and we went to the farm to harvest cotton. Seeing the harvest scene, we were so happy that we jumped three feet high. A competition to pick cotton began.

I usually do farm work well, but today I picked cotton very slowly and not cleanly. I looked up and saw Cai Yongxiang picking in the front, twenty meters ahead of me. I thought, "Why does Cai Yongxiang pick so fast? Is it not clean?" I went to the cotton field where Cai Yongxiang had picked and saw that it was smooth and clean.

During the rest, I said to Cai Yongxiang, "I don't know why, I pick slowly and not cleanly. Can you introduce your experience?" Cai Yongxiang smiled and said, "I have no experience. I just think: cotton is the country's property, the fruit of the hard work of the farm workers, even if a little is left, it is a loss to the country." I thought, "He has 'national interests' in his heart for everything he does!" Then, he opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read, "Comrade White's spirit of selflessness and dedication is shown in his extreme responsibility to his work, his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." He paused and said, "As long as we have two 'extremes' in our hearts, we can do anything well."

I did as he said, with "national interests" and two "extremes" in my heart, and the cotton was picked quickly and cleanly.

(Warrior Wu Zhongbin)

Loyal to Chairman Mao, Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought

Reader comrades! Why could Cai Yongxiang do the following: prioritize helping others, prioritize revolutionary work, and prioritize national interests? Let us invite Cai Yongxiang's comrades to tell another three stories. These three stories vividly show: Cai Yongxiang could be so selfless because he, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and was loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The First Diary

One evening, I was sitting at the table, engrossed in reading, when Cai Yongxiang suddenly excitedly said to me, "Come! Come! I wrote a few words, what do you think?" I put down my book and smiled, "Sure!"

Cai Yongxiang held up a small notebook and read seriously, "Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I deeply realize that doing revolution means not fearing hardship and death, I want to learn from Zhang Zedong, Dong Cunrui, Yang Genshi, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Wang Jie's communist style..." Cai Yongxiang read aloud, full of emotion.

I heard this and thought of little Cai's thoughts when he first joined the army: "Standing guard is a rough job, being a radio operator or a bodyguard is more impressive and exciting!" Now, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, his spiritual appearance has changed so quickly!

Then, Cai Yongxiang read word by word, "I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's words are the truth... Everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, love each other, and help each other. I will definitely do a good job in the army in the future, and we all must learn from Chairman Mao's good soldier Lei Feng." I was deeply moved.

Later, I found out that the diary Cai Yongxiang read to me that day was his first diary, shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, after he joined the army.

(Warrior Zhou Yongxin)

The First Heart-to-Heart Talk

Not long after Cai Yongxiang came to our class, I paired up with him in the "One Help One, One Red Pair" activity. One evening, Cai Yongxiang found me for a heart-to-heart talk. I thought, as an old comrade, I must help him. First, I asked in a caring tone, "Little Cai, are you not used to being away from home? Do you miss home?"

"Not at all. Revolution is about making the whole world your home. Comrade Norman Bethune came from afar to China and didn't miss home, I am in my own country and still miss home, that would be too inappropriate!" he said.

At that time, I nodded repeatedly. I thought, this new comrade actively applies Chairman Mao's works and progresses so quickly. I said to him, "Little Cai, as long as you study hard, you will progress even faster."

He listened to my words and said seriously, "Yes, I must change my thoughts and do a good job in revolutionary work, progress faster, and become a revolutionary warrior who serves the people completely and thoroughly, like Zhang Zedong."

This conversation, I originally wanted to help him, but his answers made me receive a great education. At that time, I was deeply moved and thought, Little Cai progresses so fast, it is completely because he loves Chairman Mao infinitely, actively applies Chairman Mao's works, and learns and applies them immediately.

(Warrior Zhou Yongxin)

The First Report

In early March, one evening after night shooting practice, just after the lights-out signal, Cai Yongxiang came to my room and said, "Platoon Leader, can I report my thoughts to you?" I had just been transferred to this platoon and was unfamiliar with the situation, so I needed to understand the comrades' thoughts. I didn't expect the first one to report to me to be this new comrade. I was so happy that I agreed repeatedly, "Good, good, good!" But then I thought, it's already eleven o'clock, he has to be on duty at night, I suggested changing it to the next day, and he agreed.

The next noon, we sat on the grass not far from the bridge and had a heart-to-heart talk. He said, "Platoon Leader, you must help me more, I have a lot of selfish thoughts! Those first few days after putting on the military uniform, what about being a technical soldier, what about being a chief's bodyguard, oh my! It's so shameful." He shook his head as he spoke. Then he told me that he took these questions and studied "In the Service of the People," and his mind became clear. He said, "Now I understand, to be a person, you must be like Zhang Zedong, he loves to listen to Chairman Mao's words, carving 'revolution' in his heart. Chairman Mao wants him to be a platoon leader, he works hard for the revolution; Chairman Mao wants him to burn charcoal, he gives his last drop of blood." Finally, he pointed to the bridge and said seriously, "Chairman Mao wants me to guard the bridge now, and I will definitely be a Zhang Zedong who guards the bridge."

Cai Yongxiang left, but I was still sitting there. It's better to say that he reported to me than to say that he gave me a very lively political lesson. "Be a Zhang Zedong who guards the bridge," Cai Yongxiang said it and truly did it.

    蔡永祥的故事
    第一次和蔡永祥见面
    蔡永祥同志抢救运送红卫兵专车光荣牺牲的事迹发表以后，许多熟悉他或者只同他见过一面的同志，都写了回忆英雄、学习英雄的稿件。这些同志谈到，第一次和蔡永祥见面，就对他有了良好的印象。从这些反映里可以看出，蔡永祥一心为公的世界观，是按照毛主席的教导，在平时工作和日常生活中，从点滴入手，自觉培养起来的。
    “私”字不可能一下子就从脑子里挖掉，“公”字也不可能一下子就在脑子里扎根。我们学习蔡永祥，就要像他那样，在处理日常工作中，在生活的一切领域里，从一点一滴入手，彻底挖掉“私”字，坚决树立“公”字。
    一盏马灯
    一列满载我们新战士的简易列车，从安徽开往浙江。车上没有电灯，傍晚，车厢里就夜色浓重了。
      “灯！”随着一片欢悦的喊声，车厢里霎时出现一片光明。只见一个矮胖的小同志，点起了一盏马灯。我们都高兴极了，一个个坐下来学习，可是，火车在飞奔，马灯放在桌子上，跳动；挂在壁上，摇晃。这个小同志就挺立在车厢中间，一手高举马灯，一手扶着桌沿，让灯光均匀地投射到各个角落。
    许多同志争先恐后地上去接替他。有的说：“你累了一天，身体吃不消。”他回答说：“劳动人民的身子是铁打的。”有的说：“你年纪小，……”他说：“干革命，不分大和小。”
    停车吃饭了，我看见这个小同志第一个跳下车去，忙着打水、打饭。同志们吃完了，他才吃。饭后，他又拿起扫帚把站台打扫干净，再回到车厢里，去提那盏马灯。
    夜深了。这个小同志把自己的棉被盖在战友身上，轻轻地把马灯放在跟前，打开《为人民服务》，聚精会神地读着。
    后来，我才打听到这个小同志名叫蔡永祥。这是我和蔡永祥第一次见面时留下的印象，以后再也没有见到他了。当我听到蔡永祥光荣牺牲的消息时，他那英雄的形象，也像那盏马灯一样，永远挂在我的心上。
    近来我常想：蔡永祥同志能够在抢救运送红卫兵专车中英勇献身，他那一心为公的高贵品质，决不是在牺牲的一瞬间突然出现的；而是他在平时的工作和生活中，按照毛主席的指示，一点一滴培养起来的。学习蔡永祥一心为公的高贵品质，我要从他那种“提马灯的精神”学起。
                                （战士　于连杰）
    修猪棚
    今年夏天，十分闷热。有一次，我有事到三连去，经过猪棚，只见一个浓眉大眼的小同志，光着脚，卷起袖管，钻进了又臭又脏的猪棚里进行修理。汗水和猪粪弄得他浑身都是，他还是笑咪咪地在干。我很受感动。心想，自己也是个饲养员，工作就不如他干得好。我正想赞扬几句，同我一起去的战友却抢先发了言。他说：“这个小饲养员真了不起！”话音刚落，三连的一个同志走来说：“他不是饲养员，是我们连有名的‘闲不着’，名叫蔡永祥。”我听了这话，脸刷地一下红了。我想：自己是个饲养员，却嫌干这活脏，工作做得不好，真是太不应该了。
    我和蔡永祥第一次见面，他就给了我一次活生生的教育。
    最近，我从报纸上看到蔡永祥为了抢救运送红卫兵专车英勇献身的事迹，才认识到蔡永祥脑子里有一个很大的“公”字。以蔡永祥同志为榜样，我又学习了“老三篇”，认清了养猪也是为人民服务。现在，我不怕脏，不怕累，每天把猪圈打扫得干干净净的，把猪喂得饱饱的。
                            （饲养员　蒋志田）
    救我脱险
    七月初的一天，我们连刚从外地执行任务回来，又去搬运物资。当我扛起一包很重的东西，正准备在钱塘江大桥附近横跨铁道时，一列火车从远处飞驰而来。我背的东西重，人又累，猛然听到火车的吼叫声，竟然有些发呆了。就在这十分紧急的时刻，只见一个战士向我奔来，二话没说，抢上来背过我肩上的东西，飞快地越过了铁道。我这才跟着跨过去。我十分感激地对他说：“谢谢您了！”正当我要问他名字的时候，他已经跑开了。
    八月，一个炎热的中午。我扛着一捆席子，又一次经过大桥附近。当时，我脸上身上的汗水直往外冒，两手酸得都快要抓不住席子了。这时，后面好像有人帮我扛了起来，顿时觉得轻松不少。我回头一看：又是那天救我脱险的小同志。我正想和他打招呼，只见他从裤袋里掏出手帕递给我，还做了一个擦汗的手势。我心想：这个同志真是关心别人比关心自己为重啊！
    后来，我从别的同志那里打听到，他就是蔡永祥。
                      （空军某部战士　蔡银根）
    处处做到一心为公
    许多同志在回忆蔡永祥时，说他具有一心为公的高贵品质。下面，我们请蔡永祥生前战友，讲一讲关于蔡永祥一心为公的三个小故事。从这三个故事里，我们可以看到，蔡永祥同志的确是：帮助他人为重，革命工作为重，国家利益为重。
    帮助他人为重
    我们二排有个制度：每天早上，各班轮流给伙房挑水，让炊事员多睡一会儿。
    这天该四班挑水。刚起床，同志们都争着到伙房去抢水桶。到那里一看，水缸早已装得满满的。大家不由得你看看我，我看看你，不晓得是怎么回事。
    这事只有战士还正学心里明白：
    清晨三点多钟，还正学正上岗。当他在江边游动的时候，看到一个人迈着大步到江边挑水。借着探照灯光，他看出是蔡永祥，便走过去问：“你怎么不睡觉了？”蔡永祥嘿嘿一笑：“我刚下哨，不想睡，找点事做。”还正学关切地说：“你一个人挑，太累啊！”蔡永祥摇摇头：“一个人累点不要紧，让同志们多休息休息！”
    素有“小老虎”称号的蔡永祥，挑着大水桶，从江边到伙房，飞快地往返奔跑，足足挑了一个多钟头，才把水缸挑满。天麻麻亮了，他又忙着去打扫卫生了。
                                    （二排同志）
    革命工作为重
    七月的一个晚上，我下岗回到宿舍，发现蔡永祥的铺位还空着。“咦！他到哪里去了？”我走到外面一看，发现一个人坐在桥洞底下，在借着探照灯光看书。我走过去仔细一瞧，正是蔡永祥。他聚精会神地在读“艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担……”接着，他又写开心得笔记了。
    我轻轻地对他说：“这样晚还不睡，明天学不好吗？”蔡永祥严肃地说：“不，要今天学。今天白天我没有干最重的活。按照毛主席的教导来说，这是不好的态度。我要改！”
    第二天，又是劳动。蔡永祥一上来就给大家背诵了“艰苦的工作就像担子……”这段毛主席语录。接着，他把衣服一脱，就干了起来。哪里有重活，蔡永祥就出现在哪里。哪里有困难，蔡永祥就冲到哪里。
    我看在眼里，想在心里：一个同志像蔡永祥那样，把革命工作放在第一位，就敢去争着挑重担子啊！
          （四班战士　还正学）
    国家利益为重
    九月，正是“青山翠谷金万堆，千顷棉田白云飞”的季节。蔡永祥和我们一起到农场抢收棉花。看到一片丰收景象，我们高兴得一蹦三尺高。一场你追我赶的摘棉花竞赛开始了。
    我平时干农活，样样拿得起来，今天摘棉花却很不顺手，摘得慢，还摘不干净。我抬头一看，蔡永祥摘在最前面，超过我二十多米了。我想：“蔡永祥为啥摘得那么快？是不是不干净呢？”我到蔡永祥摘过的棉田一看，嗬，光溜溜的，摘得很干净。
    休息时，我对蔡永祥说：“不知咋搞的，我摘得又慢又不干净。把你的经验介绍一下好吗？”蔡永祥笑了笑说：“我没有什么经验。我只是想：棉花是国家的财产，是农场工人同志辛勤劳动的果实，哪怕丢下一点，对国家都是损失。”我想：原来他干什么事心里都装着个“国家利益”啊！接着，他翻开《毛主席语录》读起来：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”念到这里，他停了一下说：“只要咱们心上刻上两个‘极端’，什么事情都能做好。”
    我照着他的话去做，心里装着“国家利益”和两个“极端”，棉花就摘得又快又干净了。
                              （战士　吴忠斌）
    忠于毛主席忠于毛泽东思想
    读者同志！蔡永祥为什么能够做到：帮助他人为重，革命工作为重，国家利益为重？让我们再请蔡永祥的战友们讲一讲另外三个故事。这三个故事生动地说明：蔡永祥能够这样一心为公，是他以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是他忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的结果。
    第一篇日记
    一天晚上，我坐在桌子旁边，正在聚精会神地看书，对面的蔡永祥同志忽然兴奋地对我说：“来！来！我写了几句话，你看怎么样？”我放下书本，微笑着说：“好嘛！”
    蔡永祥双手捧起小本子，认真地念了起来：“我通过学习毛主席著作，深深想到干革命就要不怕苦，不怕死，我要学习张思德、董存瑞、杨根思、黄继光、雷锋、王杰他们的共产主义风格……”蔡永祥放声朗读，感情充沛。
    我听到这里，想起小蔡刚入伍时还有这种想法：“站岗放哨是个粗活，干个无线电兵、警卫员什么的，多威武痛快！”如今，他在毛泽东思想哺育下，精神面貌变化多快呀！
    接着，蔡永祥又一个字一个字地念道：“我深深体会到，毛主席说的话都是真理……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。我今后在部队里一定要把工作做好，我们都要学习毛主席的好战士雷锋。”我听了，很受感动。
    后来我知道，原来那天蔡永祥同志给我读的这篇日记，是他入伍以后写的第一篇闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的日记。
                                （战士　周永新）
    第一次谈心
    蔡永祥同志来到我们班不久，我就和他结成了“一帮一，一对红”的对子。一天晚上，蔡永祥同志找我谈心。我想，自己是个老同志，一定要帮助帮助他。首先，我用关心的口气问道：
      “小蔡，刚离开家不大习惯吧，想不想家？”
      “不想家。干革命四海为家嘛，人家白求恩不远万里来到中国都不想家，我在本国革命再想家，那太不应该了！”他说。
    当时，我不住地点头。心想，这个新同志活学活用毛主席著作，进步真快。我就对他说：“小蔡，只要好好学习，你的进步一定会更快。”
    他听了我的话，也认真地说：“是的，我一定要好好改造思想，干好革命工作，更快地进步，像张思德那样，成为一个不为名，不为利，‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务的革命战士。”
    这次谈话，我本来只想帮助他，没想到他的回答倒使我受到了很大的教育。当时，我深受感动，心想：小蔡进步这么快，完全是他对毛主席无限热爱，活学活用毛主席著作，学了就用的结果。
                              （战士　周永新）
    第一次汇报
    三月上旬的一个晚上，夜间射击预习回来，刚吹过熄灯哨子，蔡永祥同志来到我的房间，他说：“排长，我向你汇报汇报思想，好吗？”我刚调来这个排，情况生疏，很需要了解同志们的思想情况。我没想到，第一个来向我汇报的，竟是这个新同志。我高兴得连口答应：“好，好，好啊！”可是又一想：现在已经十一点了，他半夜还要执勤，我再三建议改为明天，他才同意了。
    第二天中午，我们坐在大桥不远的草地上谈心。他开口就说：“排长，你要多多帮助我，我这个人私心杂念可真不少呀！刚穿上军装那几天，什么当个技术兵，什么当个首长警卫员，哎呀呀！真可耻。”他一边说，一边摇头。接着他又告诉我，他带着这些问题，学习了《为人民服务》，心里才亮堂起来。他说：“现在我懂了，做人，就要做个张思德那样的人，他最爱听毛主席的话，把‘革命’两字刻在心坎上。毛主席要他当班长，他拚死拚活干革命；毛主席要他烧木炭，他流尽最后一滴血。”最后，他指着大桥严肃地说：“毛主席现在要我守大桥，我也一定做一个守卫大桥的张思德。”
    蔡永祥同志走了，我还坐在那里。与其说是他向我汇报，倒不如说是他给我上了一堂极为生动的政治课。“做一个守卫大桥的张思德”，蔡永祥这样说了，也真正这样做了。
