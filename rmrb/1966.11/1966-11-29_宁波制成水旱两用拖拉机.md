The workers of the Ningbo Agricultural Machinery Factory in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, have displayed a spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to pioneer. With the cooperation of relevant factories, they have recently successfully developed the "East Red" brand 20-horsepower small tractor. This small tractor is primarily used for plowing paddy fields but can also be used for plowing dry land. Additionally, it can be used for transportation, water pumping, rice hulling, and generating electricity for lighting, making it highly suitable for agricultural production in semi-mountainous areas and river network regions. It has been well received by the commune members.
