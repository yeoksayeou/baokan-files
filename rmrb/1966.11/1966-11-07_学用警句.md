	Eliminate one part of individualism and selfishness, and you will increase one part of a heart dedicated to serving the people. This will also add a surge of revolutionary spirit.

		Soldier Jiang Xiu Gen

	A single drop of ink can pollute an entire basin of clear water; a single selfish thought can corrupt the whole soul. To transform one's thoughts, one must be strict and meticulous.

    学用警句
    歼灭一分个人主义的私心，就增长一分为人民服务的红心，也就增添一股革命干劲。
                战士　江秀根
    一滴墨水，能把一盆清水染污；一分私心，会把整个灵魂腐蚀。改造思想，必须严字当头，一丝不苟。
                通信员　苗风池
