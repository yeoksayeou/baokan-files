Chinese and Cambodian athletes held a grand gathering

According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 19th - Chinese and Cambodian athletes held a grand gathering on the evening of the 18th in a large hall of the newly built "Sports City" in Phnom Penh. The athletes of both countries sang and danced, expressing their deep friendship and their common determination to successfully hold the First Asian New Games.

Li Menghua, deputy leader of the Chinese sports delegation, spoke at the gathering. He said, "The First Asian New Games is a grand event where the peoples and athletes of Asia come together to promote friendship, mutual progress, and common development, and to unite against imperialism. Its successful holding will shatter the imperialists' control and monopoly over international sports and will greatly encourage the peoples of Asia to further unite against the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism."

Hou Sen An, leader of the Cambodian sports delegation, said in his speech: "This Asian New Games will emphasize that all participating countries reject submission to the bullying of American imperialism. American imperialism wants to impose its will in the field of sports on these countries. If the United States and its loyal lackeys think their threats can work on us, if they think their most despicable and vile plots can defeat us, then they are greatly mistaken. Because we have our lofty ideals, which is to live independently and not rely on Washington."

At the gathering, the Cambodian athletes expressed their deep affection for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Cambodian badminton player Guozhina and others also sang the song "Remembering China" written by Prince Sihanouk and Chinese revolutionary songs, receiving wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The Chinese athletes at the gathering warmly praised Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian government, and the sports community for their active support and great efforts to ensure the successful holding of the First Asian New Games. They pointed out that this is another great contribution by the Cambodian people to strengthen the unity of the peoples of Asia against imperialism.

The Chinese athletes also performed many songs and dances praising Chairman Mao with the Cambodian friends' clapping accompaniment and sang the newly learned Cambodian song "Song of Labor."

The enthusiastic atmosphere at the gathering once again vividly demonstrated the deepening and developing friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia. At this grand gathering, the athletes of both countries sang and danced, pushing this deep friendship to a new height.

    歌唱中柬人民友谊表达开好亚新会的共同决心
    中柬运动员举行盛大联欢
    据新华社金边十九日电　中国和柬埔寨两国运动员十八日夜晚在金边新建的“体育城”的一座大厅里举行了盛大的联欢。两国体育健儿们载歌载舞，纵情歌唱情深似海的中柬友谊，共同表达了他们要开好第一届亚新会的决心。
    中国体育代表团副团长李梦华在联欢会上讲了话。他说，第一届亚新会“是亚洲人民和运动员为了增进友好、互相促进、共同发展、团结反帝的一次盛会。它的胜利举行，将粉碎帝国主义对国际体育事业的控制和垄断，将有力地鼓舞亚洲人民进一步团结起来反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。”
    柬埔寨体育代表团团长屋森安在讲话中说：这届亚新会将着重表明，所有参加国拒绝在美帝国主义的霸道面前屈服。美帝国主义想在体育方面把它的意志强加于这些国家。如果美国和它的忠实奴才认为他们的威胁对我们能起作用，如果他们认为他们的最卑鄙、最恶劣的阴谋能够挫败我们，那么他们就大错特错了。因为我们有我们崇高的理想，这就是独立自主的生活，而不依靠华盛顿。
    在联欢会上，柬埔寨体育健儿们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席表达了深厚的爱戴之情，“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”柬埔寨羽毛球女运动员果芝娜等还演唱了西哈努克亲王写的歌曲《怀念中国》和中国革命歌曲，博得了全场一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    中国的体育健儿在联欢会上热烈赞扬西哈努克亲王、柬埔寨政府和体育界为使第一届亚新会胜利举行所给予的积极支持和所作出的巨大努力。他们指出，这是柬埔寨人民为加强亚洲人民团结反帝事业的又一巨大贡献。
    中国运动员们还在柬埔寨朋友们的拍手伴奏下表演了许多歌颂毛主席的歌曲和舞蹈，并唱了新学的柬埔寨歌曲《劳动之歌》。
    联欢会上所表现的热烈气氛，再一次生动地表明了中柬两国人民之间的日益巩固和发展的深厚友谊。在这盛大的联欢会上，中柬两国体育健儿载歌载舞，把这深厚的友谊又推向一个新的高峰。
