The first Asian New Emerging Forces Games opened today, under the guidance of the spirit of enhancing friendship, mutual promotion, and common development, and unity against imperialism. The successful holding of the games marks a new stage in the development of sports in Asia and is another heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' monopoly over international sports.

The Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, attended the opening ceremony. When he declared the games open at 4:04 p.m., the stadium erupted in applause and cheers. Nearly 2,000 athletes from 17 countries and regions in Asia, along with 60,000 spectators, enthusiastically celebrated this historic moment, hailing the new great victory of the Asian people in independently and autonomously developing sports.

Today, the entire city of Phnom Penh was festive. At the National Sports Complex, colorful flags stood tall, and balloons floated high. The flags of the 17 countries and regions participating in the first Asian New Emerging Forces Games fluttered in the wind. These countries and regions include Cambodia, China, Vietnam, Laos, North Korea, Mongolia, Pakistan, Nepal, Ceylon, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Japan.

The stands around the stadium were packed. The citizens of Phnom Penh had been flocking here since noon, braving the tropical sun to await this historic moment.

Attending the opening ceremony were: Chairman of the Royal Council of Cambodia, Prince Monireth, the Head of State's personal advisor, Bin Bun, President of the National Assembly, Tou Samouth, President of the Royal Assembly, Prince Monirath, Prime Minister Lon Nol, General Neak Vong, Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces General Staff, other government members, members of both houses, and other responsible officials.

At 3:20 p.m., the grand parade began. The sports delegations from various countries entered the stadium to the sound of joyful marches. The entire stadium erupted in applause, paying tribute to the athletes from various countries and regions who, despite the threats and sabotage of imperialism, overcame numerous difficulties and traveled far to Phnom Penh.

The people enthusiastically welcomed the athletes from the front lines of the anti-American struggle—the heroic people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the athletes of the Lao Patriotic Front.

With deep feelings, the people warmly welcomed the athletes from the great People's Republic of China. The Chinese athletes, with the revolutionary enthusiasm and spirit ignited by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, came here determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to work together with athletes from various countries to smash the imperialist monopoly and control over sports, to enhance friendship and unity among the peoples of Asian countries, and to make their contributions to the success of this games.

The people enthusiastically welcomed the athletes from five Arab countries and regions. The people of these countries and regions are waging a tenacious struggle against the aggression of the U.S. imperialists' tool—Israel—and the threats of U.S. imperialism. Their just struggle has won the sympathy and support of the progressive peoples of Asia and the world.

The people also enthusiastically welcomed the athletes from various countries who, despite the threats of the International Olympic Committee manipulated by U.S. imperialism, resolutely came to participate in the first Asian New Emerging Forces Games.

As the largest delegation of this games—the Cambodian sports delegation—entered the stadium last, the people gave them a long round of applause, paying tribute to the Cambodian government and people who had prepared excellent conditions for the success of this games.

This games, from its inception, has nearly 2,000 athletes from 17 countries and regions participating, fully demonstrating its boundless vitality. As our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong said, "The people of the world must have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, fear no difficulties, and press on. Then, the whole world will certainly belong to the people."

After the parade, Prince Sihanouk handed the flag of the Asian New Emerging Forces Games to three female athletes, who were then escorted by nine male athletes to the flagpole to raise it. At this moment, the stadium resonated with songs praising the Asian New Emerging Forces Games. Everyone present stood up to pay tribute to this flag, symbolizing unity against imperialism. The electronic scoreboard displayed the slogan "Glory to the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games."

His Excellency Prince Essaraj, Vice-Chairman of the Cambodian National Organizing Committee for the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games and Representative of the Royal Government of Cambodia to the Sports Bureau, delivered a speech. He said that at this solemn gathering, we have turned a new page, a glorious page in the history of Asian sports and in the history of our continent, which has long been oppressed by colonialism.

He said that this grand gathering is a competition on the sports field, which has a special spirit—that is, the spirit of mutual cooperation and mutual assistance to promote the sports movement of the new emerging forces; it is the spirit of fully strengthening our physiques, tempering our courage, and forging our characters independently and completely. He pointed out that this grand gathering will show the world, especially the imperialists who harbor hatred and watch us, how united the peoples of Asian countries are; it will show that this unity is not an empty slogan.

Prince Essaraj pointed out that although some international sports federations tried to impose their hegemony on us and made threats, and although they colluded with each other to slander and plot evil schemes, we did not yield to their will. This grand gathering proves that the flame of the spirit of the New Emerging Forces Games is burning fiercely among us and inspiring us all. He emphasized that the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games "provides us all with an opportunity to show the world that the true new forces we represent must be taken seriously."

In his speech, Prince Essaraj paid a warm tribute to the athletes and sports workers from the front lines of the anti-imperialist struggle in Vietnam and reaffirmed: Cambodia fully supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

After Prince Sihanouk solemnly declared the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games officially open, the famous Cambodian track and field athlete Dinh Binh Thon carried the torch and ran into the stadium, lighting the flame of the Asian New Emerging Forces Games at the stand opposite the podium. This torch was lit on the afternoon of November 23 at the ancient city of Angkor's "Bakong" temple and was relayed by Cambodian athletes to Phnom Penh.

Next, the famous Cambodian swimmer Yik Heng represented all the athletes to take the oath.

The choir of the Royal University of Fine Arts sang a welcoming song. At this moment, colorful balloons rose from the crowd, and flocks of doves took to the sky. The sports delegations from various countries withdrew from the stadium amid the cheers of the entire audience.

Subsequently, more than 20,000 Cambodian male and female students and soldiers performed a grand mass gymnastics and pattern gymnastics with the theme "Prosperous Cambodia is Marching Forward." Their rich and colorful performances showed the great achievements of the Cambodian people under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, after rejecting U.S. "aid," in national construction in various aspects through self-reliance; it showed the Cambodian people's resolute resistance to imperialist aggression, resolute support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and resolute support for the anti-American struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; it showed the determination of the Asian people to break the imperialist monopoly over sports and to independently and autonomously develop the sports of various countries. Throughout the performance, the stadium was filled with thunderous applause.

Today, invited to attend the opening ceremony were: Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia, Chen Shuliang, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Cambodia. The Chairman of the New Emerging Forces Games Federation, Maladi, also attended the opening ceremony.

Tonight, a fireworks display will be held at the National Sports Complex to celebrate the successful opening of the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games.

    这届亚洲新运会开创伊始，就有十七个国家和地区的近两千名运动员参加，这充分地说明了它具有无限的生命力。正如我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席所说的：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。”

    埃萨罗亲王指出，尽管某些国际体育联合会企图把它们的霸道强加于我们而大肆进行威胁，尽管它们相互配合起来千方百计地进行诽谤，并施展险恶的阴谋，但是，我们并没有向它们的意志屈服。这次盛会证明，新运会精神的火焰通过我们正在熊熊燃烧，并且鼓舞着我们大家。他强调说，第一届亚洲新运会“正好给我们大家提供了一个机会，向全世界表明，我们所代表的，是必须予以重视的真正的新生力量。”

    接着，柬埔寨著名游泳运动员易金兴代表全体运动员宣誓。
    柬埔寨美术大学的合唱团唱起了欢迎的歌曲。这时，五彩缤纷的气球从人群中冉冉升起，一群群鸽子腾空飞翔。各国体育代表团在全场的欢呼声中陆续退场。
    随后，两万多名柬埔寨男女学生和士兵表演了以“繁荣的柬埔寨在前进”为主题的大型团体操和图案操。他们的丰富多彩的表演，显示了柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，在拒绝美“援”以后，通过自力更生，在国家建设各方面所取得的重大成就；显示了柬埔寨人民坚决抵抗帝国主义的侵略，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的反美斗争；显示了亚洲人民决心打破帝国主义对体育事业的垄断，独立自主地发展各国的体育事业。在表演过程中，全场不断响起雷动的掌声。
