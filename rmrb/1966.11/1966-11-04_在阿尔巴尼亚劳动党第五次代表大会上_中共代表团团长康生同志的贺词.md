The Chinese Communist Party delegation, led by Comrade Kang Sheng, Head of the Delegation, Central Committee Member of the Chinese Communist Party, Standing Committee Member of the Political Bureau, and Secretary of the Secretariat, delivered a speech at the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labour Party on November 2, 1966. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Dear Comrade Enver Hoxha,
Dear Delegates,

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has sent us as a delegation to participate in the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labour Party. We are very pleased to be here.

First, allow me to read the telegram of congratulations from Comrade Mao Zedong on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labour Party (the full text of the telegram is on page one).

Dear Comrades,

The Chinese Communist Party and all Marxist-Leninists around the world, the Chinese people and all revolutionary peoples around the world, are filled with great excitement as we celebrate your congress. We extend our proletarian revolutionary greetings to you!

Since the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labour Party, more than five years have passed. These have been five years of sharp and complex international class struggle, five years of fierce struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. During these five years, the heroic Albanian people have waged a tenacious struggle against both international and domestic class enemies, achieving great victories. In the construction of socialism and the socialist revolution, they have also made further brilliant achievements.

The Albanian Labour Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a party that has been tested in revolution and is a Marxist-Leninist party with high prestige in the international communist movement. It is a party that is loyal to proletarian internationalism and to the people.

The Albanian Labour Party has raised the banner of opposing imperialism, firmly opposing the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, firmly supporting the national democratic movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and firmly supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. Socialist Albania is a strong shock troop in the fight against imperialism and in support of world revolution.

The Albanian Labour Party has raised the banner of opposing modern revisionism, engaging in a head-on struggle with the leadership of the CPSU and its followers, and with the Tito renegade clique. It has deeply exposed and criticized modern revisionism, defended and developed Marxism-Leninism, and set a brilliant example for all Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations around the world.

The Albanian Labour Party insists on the dictatorship of the proletariat, carries out class struggle, emphasizes proletarian politics, stresses the mass line, attaches importance to revolutionary education, and resolutely carries the socialist revolution to the end. The Albanian Labour Party has taken a series of revolutionary measures to prevent the restoration of capitalism and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat: it opposes bureaucratism, establishes revolutionary methods and work styles; it streamlines organizations, deploys cadres, and strengthens the grassroots; cadres participate in labor; high salaries are reduced; in the army, party committees lead all work, political commissars are re-established, and military ranks are abolished; revolutionary education is strengthened among the people, especially among the youth, to cultivate true revolutionaries, and so on. These revolutionary measures have great theoretical and practical significance. They will not only greatly advance Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction but will also enrich the experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, thus having a profound international impact.

The Albanian Labour Party adheres to the principle of self-reliance in building socialism, leading the Albanian people in arduous struggle, smashing the blockade and sabotage by imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, and the Tito renegade clique, and successfully completing the third five-year plan. Now, Albania's industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings have developed greatly, the people's living standards have improved further, and national defense forces have been strengthened. Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. Your achievements convincingly demonstrate that by adhering to the socialist path, implementing the principle of self-reliance, and relying on the boundless enthusiasm and selfless labor of the people, any difficulty can be overcome, and many miracles can be created.

The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labour Party is a major event of historical significance in the political life of the Albanian Labour Party and the Albanian people. Comrade Enver Hoxha's report to the congress provides a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of international and domestic issues in Albania, and has great significance for the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership, and for Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The political tasks and the fourth five-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture proposed by the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labour Party will promote a new comprehensive upsurge in the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people, accelerate the development of Albania's economy and culture, and open up a more brilliant prospect for defending and strengthening the socialist state of Albania. The Chinese Communist Party is convinced that this congress will push Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new high, and will make greater contributions to the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

Comrades, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, our Chinese people have launched the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. We have learned from Dazhai in agriculture, from Daqing in industry, and the whole country has learned from the People's Liberation Army. On all fronts of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, we have achieved great victories.

Our national economy is developing steadily and healthily. On the industrial front, we have initially established an independent and relatively complete modern industrial system. In recent years, industrial production has exceeded the plan, and the quantity, variety, and quality of products have all increased significantly. On the agricultural front, rural people's communes have been further consolidated and developed. The broad masses of commune members, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, have carried out large-scale water conservancy projects, fine farming, and have achieved good harvests for five consecutive years. The market is bustling, and prices are stable. The success of three nuclear tests and this missile-carrying nuclear weapon test has concentratedly demonstrated our country's new level of scientific and technological and industrial development, marking that our country's scientific and technological and national defense forces are developing at an even faster pace. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our people, with the great aspirations of the proletariat, have made up their minds to overcome all difficulties and to tread a path where no one has trodden before, to scale peaks that no one has scaled before.

This year is the first year of our country's third five-year plan for the development of the national economy. Industrial and agricultural production is expected to exceed the plan, laying a good foundation for the successful implementation of the third five-year plan. Our country is on the verge of a new comprehensive leap forward.

In August, our Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's theory that class and class struggle exist in socialist society, summarized new experiences of our country's mass movements, and formulated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This decision, personally presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong, and his series of statements on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are a major development of Marxism-Leninism.

Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a deeper and broader new stage in the development of our socialist revolution. The focus of this movement is to strike at a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are the main force of this cultural revolution. The broad revolutionary youth and the Red Guards they organized have become brave pioneers. Under the leadership of the Party, the Red Guard movement has launched a fierce attack on all the rotten things left over from the old world, achieving stunning victories that have shocked the world. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is breaking down the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, and establishing the new ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the proletariat. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed and struggled against. The reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie have been criticized to the point of losing their prestige. All superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base are being reformed. The fundamental problem that our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to solve is to uproot the social basis of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and further consolidate our country's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong over the reactionary bourgeois line, and it is a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Our people are enthusiastically responding to Comrade Mao Zedong's great call, resolutely carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our entire Party, army, and nation are pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works to a new high. Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, becomes a tremendous material force. A large number of advanced individuals have emerged, and a large number of advanced deeds have been created. The working people of the whole country take Mao Zedong Thought as their guide to action and as a weapon for criticism and struggle. This is a great event in the history of the development of Marxism.

The communiqué of our Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee points out: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of our Party and our country." To unify the thoughts of the people of the whole country with Mao Zedong Thought is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee that our country's proletarian dictatorship will never change color. Our country, advancing along the path of socialism and communism, will be able to better support and help the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, fulfilling our great duty of proletarian internationalism.

Comrades, we are now in a new great era of world revolution. Various political forces are undergoing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. Imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership, and the reactionaries of all countries are all in a state of disintegration, while the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world are developing deeply. What lies before us is a great situation.

American imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of the world. Defeating this greatest aggressor in human history is the central task of the peoples of the world.

The CPSU leadership is the faithful successor of Khrushchev. They are implementing Khrushchev-style revisionism without Khrushchev, implementing a line of cooperation with American imperialism, maintaining the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world, and implementing the restoration of capitalism in the socialist world. Their true colors as the henchmen of imperialism and the traitors and scoundrels of the workers' movement have been more fully exposed. People clearly see that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism.

American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership are stepping up their counter-revolutionary joint actions. Their goal is to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world and maintain their reactionary rule. Their counter-revolutionary joint actions are directed against all true Marxist-Leninists in the world, against the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially against the heroic Vietnamese people who are making great contributions to the international anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, and against the Albanian Labour Party and the Chinese Communist Party, which firmly support world revolution. They are trying to form an anti-China encirclement around our country, forming a "holy alliance" against China, against communism, and against revolution.

Currently, the focus of the joint actions of the United States and the Soviet Union to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world is to jointly plot to extinguish the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. American imperialism has suffered defeats in the Vietnam War, and the Vietnamese people are becoming stronger. While American imperialism is stepping up the "escalation" of the war, it is also intensively promoting the "peace talks" deception. The Soviet revisionist leadership is doing its utmost to serve the "peace talks" fraud of American imperialism. They are doing this to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, to force the Vietnamese people's homeland to be permanently divided, and to force the people of South Vietnam to be permanently enslaved. However, the plots of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership will never succeed. The Vietnamese people are determined to defeat the American aggressors and plant the flag of victory throughout Vietnam. The Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and vow to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. No matter how much American imperialism expands its aggressive war, the Chinese people will fully support the Vietnamese people and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Our Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have caused imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries to be in a state of extreme panic. They are afraid that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will arouse the revolutionary proletarian factions within their countries, arouse the broad revolutionary masses to oppose them and overthrow them. They are desperately trying to block the revolutionary storm rising in China, and are jointly staging a new anti-communist and anti-China farce. In this performance, the CPSU leadership is playing the leading role. They have organized a group of lackeys to use various means of distortion, slander, and defamation to attack China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attack the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. They are running around, plotting to convene a gathering of traitors and scoundrels, trying to complete Khrushchev's unfinished task of isolating China and opposing China.

The anti-China heroes will not have a good ending. The more fiercely they oppose, the more miserably they will fail. The Chinese Communist Party, which adheres to Marxism-Leninism, is not afraid of isolation and will never be isolated.

Facing the counter-revolutionary joint actions of modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership, the important task of all true revolutionary Marxist-Leninists is to thoroughly expose the plots of this so-called "joint action" and to press on with the struggle against modern revisionism to the end.

In the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no middle ground. Towards modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership, one must draw a clear line of demarcation, thoroughly expose their traitorous true colors, and absolutely not engage in any "joint action" with them. If one is determined to engage in some "joint action" with them, one will inevitably join the anti-China chorus of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and fall into the pit of opposing socialist China.

In the struggle between Marxist-Leninist parties and modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership, the Chinese Communist Party, the Albanian Labour Party, and other Marxist-Leninist brother parties have dealt decisive blows to modern revisionism in politics and theory, drawn clear lines of demarcation with them in all aspects, and thus greatly promoted the development of Marxist-Leninist forces around the world. Where there are revisionist groups, there are revolutionary Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations as their opponents to struggle against them. Now, on all continents of the world, Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations are emerging one after another and are becoming stronger and more consolidated. They are drawing clear lines of demarcation with modern revisionist groups in theory, ideology, politics, organization, and style. They are striving to build their parties into new-type Marxist-Leninist revolutionary parties. These new-type proletarian revolutionary parties represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and revolutionary people of these countries, represent the future and hope of these countries, and are the leading cores of the revolution in these countries. The emergence and development of new-type Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations is a great victory in the struggle of Marxism-Leninism against modern revisionism.

Dear Comrades! The Chinese and Albanian parties and peoples have forged a deep friendship in their common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. This friendship has been tempered by the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Labour Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and has been tested in the revolutionary struggle for a common ideal. We have always supported, helped, learned from, and encouraged each other. In the future, no matter what storms and tempests we may encounter on our forward path, the two parties and peoples will continue to hold high the red flag of Marxism-Leninism and the red flag of proletarian internationalism, side by side, breaking waves and forging ahead to victory.

Long live the successful Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labour Party!

Long live the glorious Albanian Labour Party and its beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people!

Long live the revolutionary unity and fighting friendship between the Chinese and Albanian parties and peoples!

Long live the great unity of the revolutionary peoples of the world!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上
    中共代表团团长康生同志的贺词
    新华社地拉那二日电　中国共产党代表团团长、中共中央政治局常务委员、中央书记处书记康生同志二日在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上的贺词，全文如下：亲爱的恩维尔·霍查同志，亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会派我们代表团前来参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，我们感到十分高兴。
    首先，请允许我宣读毛泽东同志签署的中国共产党中央委员会致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电（贺电全文见第一版）亲爱的同志们：
    中国共产党和全世界马克思列宁主义者，中国人民和全世界革命人民，都怀着十分兴奋的心情欢庆你们的代表大会。我们向同志们致无产阶级革命的敬礼！
    从阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会到现在，已经五年多了。这是国际阶级斗争尖锐、复杂的五年，是马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义激烈斗争的五年。在这五年中间，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，同国际和国内的阶级敌人进行了英勇顽强的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利，在社会主义建设和社会主义革命方面，也进一步取得了辉煌的成就。
    以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，是久经考验的革命的马克思列宁主义的党，是在国际共产主义运动中享有很高威望的党，是忠于无产阶级国际主义、忠于人民的党。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，高举反对帝国主义的旗帜，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，是一支反对帝国主义、支持世界革命的坚强的突击队。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，高举反对现代修正主义的旗帜，同苏共领导集团及其追随者，同铁托叛徒集团，进行了针锋相对的斗争，深刻地揭露和批判了现代修正主义，捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，为全世界马克思列宁主义政党和组织树立了光辉的榜样。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，坚持无产阶级专政，开展阶级斗争，突出无产阶级政治，强调群众路线，重视革命教育，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党采取了一系列防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政的革命措施：反对官僚主义，树立革命的工作方法和工作作风；精简机构，下放干部，充实基层；干部参加劳动；降低高工资；在军队建立党委领导全部工作，重新设立政治委员，取消军衔；加强对人民群众特别是对青年的革命教育，以培养真正的革命者，等等。这些革命措施，具有重大的理论意义和实践意义。它不仅将大大推进阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，而且将丰富无产阶级专政的经验，从而发生深远的国际影响。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，坚持自力更生建设社会主义的原则，领导阿尔巴尼亚人民，艰苦奋斗，粉碎了帝国主义、苏共修正主义领导集团、铁托叛徒集团的封锁和破坏，成功地完成了第三个五年计划。现在，阿尔巴尼亚的工农业生产和文化教育事业有了很大的发展，人民生活有了进一步的提高，国防力量更加增强了。阿尔巴尼亚已经从一个落后的农业国变成了具有现代工业、集体农业的先进的社会主义国家。你们的成就令人信服地表明，坚持走社会主义的道路，实行自力更生原则，依靠人民群众的冲天干劲和忘我劳动，任何困难都能被战胜，许多人间奇迹都能创造出来。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民政治生活中具有历史意义的重大事件。恩维尔·霍查同志在大会上所作的报告，对国际和阿尔巴尼亚国内问题作了深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，对反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，对阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，具有重大意义。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会所提出的政治任务和发展国民经济和文化的第四个五年计划，为促进阿尔巴尼亚人民革命精神的新的全面高涨，为加速阿尔巴尼亚的经济和文化的发展，为保卫和加强阿尔巴尼亚社会主义国家，开辟了更加光辉的前景。中国共产党深信，你们这次大会，将把阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向一个新的高潮，将对世界各国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，作出更大的贡献。
    同志们，我们中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指引下，展开了阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，工业学大庆，农业学大寨，全国大学解放军，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设各个战线上都取得了伟大的胜利。
    我国的国民经济正在持续地健康地向前发展。在工业战线上，我们已经初步建立起一个独立自主的、部门比较齐全的、现代化的工业体系。几年来，工业生产都超额完成了计划，产品的数量、品种、质量，都有了很大的增长和提高。在农业战线上，农村人民公社得到了进一步的巩固和发展，广大社员以愚公移山的精神，大搞农田水利建设，精耕细作，使农业生产连续五年获得了好收成。市场繁荣，物价稳定。三次核试验的成功，这一次发射导弹核武器试验的成功，集中表现了我国科学技术和工业发展的新水平，标志着我国科学技术和国防力量，正以更大的速度向前发展。我国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，怀着无产阶级的雄心壮志，下定决心，排除万难，要走前人没有走过的道路，要攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。
    今年是我国发展国民经济第三个五年计划的头一年，工农业生产预计可以超额完成，为胜利实现第三个五年计划打下了良好的基础。我国正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。
    今年八月召开的我党八届十一中全会，根据毛泽东同志关于社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争的理论，总结了我国群众运动的新经验，制订了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》。毛泽东同志亲自主持制订的这个决定和他关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列论述，是马克思列宁主义的一个重大发展。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是我国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。这次运动的重点，是打击一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派。广大的工农兵群众、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部，是这场文化大革命的主力军。广大的革命青少年和他们所组织的红卫兵，成了勇敢的闯将。在党的领导下，红卫兵运动向旧世界遗留下来的一切腐朽的事物，发动了猛烈的进攻，取得震惊世界的辉煌战果。这场无产阶级文化大革命，大破剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。混进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派受到揭发和斗争。资产阶级的反动学术“权威”被批判得威风扫地。对一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑正在进行改革。我国无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本问题，就是铲除修正主义的社会基础，防止资本主义复辟，进一步巩固我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。
    无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线对资产阶级反动路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利。我国人民正在热烈响应毛泽东同志的伟大号召，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们全党、全军、全国正在把活学活用毛泽东同志著作的群众运动推向一个新的高潮。毛泽东思想掌握了群众，就变为巨大的物质力量。大量的先进人物涌现出来了，大量的先进事迹创造出来了。全国劳动人民把毛泽东思想作为行动的指南，作为批判和战斗的武器，这是马克思主义发展史上的一个划时代的大事。
    我们党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党全国一切工作的指导方针。”用毛泽东思想统一全国人民的思想，是使我国无产阶级专政永不变色的最可靠最根本的保证。我国沿着社会主义和共产主义道路胜利前进，就能够更好地支持和帮助全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，完成我们应当担负的无产阶级国际主义的伟大义务。
    同志们，现在我们正处在世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。各种政治力量正在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面。以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义、各国反动派，都陷于四分五裂的困境，而全世界人民的革命运动则正在深入地向前发展。呈现在我们面前的，是一派大好形势。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌。打垮这个人类历史上最大的侵略者，是全世界人民的中心任务。
    苏共领导集团是赫鲁晓夫的忠实继承者。他们实行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义，实行一条同美帝国主义合作、在资本主义世界维护帝国主义和殖民主义的统治、在社会主义世界实行资本主义复辟的路线。他们作为帝国主义的帮凶和工人运动的工贼和叛徒的面目，更加暴露了。人们清楚地看到，要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。
    美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团正在加紧搞反革命的联合行动。他们的目的，是为了镇压世界人民的革命斗争和维持他们的反动统治。他们的反革命联合行动的矛头，针对着全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者，针对着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命人民，特别是针对着对国际反帝革命斗争做着重大贡献的英雄的越南人民，针对着坚决支持世界革命的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党。他们力图在我国周围组成一个反华包围圈，结成一个反华、反共、反革命的“神圣同盟”。
    当前，美苏合作镇压世界人民革命斗争的重点，就是共同策划扑灭越南人民的抗美救国战争。美帝国主义在侵越战争中屡战屡败，越南人民越战越强。美帝国主义在加紧战争“升级”的同时，大搞“和谈”阴谋。苏联修正主义领导集团为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局大力效劳。他们这样做，就是要迫使越南人民屈服，就是要迫使越南人民的祖国永远被分裂，就是要迫使越南南方人民永远受奴役。但是，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团的阴谋是决不能得逞的。越南人民决心打败美国侵略者，把胜利的旗帜插遍全越南。中国人民决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，誓做越南人民的坚强后盾。不管美帝国主义怎样扩大侵略战争，中国人民都将全力支援越南人民，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    我党八届十一中全会和我国无产阶级文化大革命，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派恐慌万状。他们害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命唤起他们国内的无产阶级革命派，唤起广大革命人民反对他们，推翻他们。他们妄图阻挡中国兴起的革命风暴，正在联合演出反共反华的新丑剧。在这场表演中，苏共领导集团充当了主角。他们组织一批娄罗，以种种歪曲、造谣、诽谤的手法，攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，攻击中国人民、中国共产党和我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志。他们四出奔走，阴谋策划召开叛徒工贼的大集会，力图完成赫鲁晓夫孤立中国、反对中国的未竟之志。
    反华的英雄好汉们是不会有好下场的。谁反得最凶，谁失败得最惨。马克思列宁主义的中国共产党，决不怕孤立，也是永远不会孤立的。
    面对着以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的这种反革命联合行动，一切真正革命的马克思列宁主义者的重要任务，就是要彻底揭露这种所谓“联合行动”的阴谋，就是要乘胜追击，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    在马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义的斗争中，决没有中间道路可走。对于以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，只有同他们划清界限，彻底揭露他们叛徒的真面目，绝不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。如果一心一意同他们搞什么“联合行动”，那就必然要参加帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华大合唱，堕落到反对社会主义中国的泥坑里去。
    在马克思列宁主义政党同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和其他马克思列宁主义兄弟党，在政治上和理论上给予现代修正主义以决定性的打击，从各方面同他们划清界限，从而大大地促进了全世界马克思列宁主义力量的发展。有修正主义集团，就有革命的马克思列宁主义政党和组织作为对立面，来同他们斗争。现在，在全世界各大洲，马克思列宁主义的政党和组织纷纷出现，并且日益壮大和巩固。他们正在从理论上、思想上、政治上、组织上和作风上同现代修正主义集团划清界限。他们正在努力把自己的党建设成为新型的马克思列宁主义的革命党。这些新型的无产阶级革命党，代表着这些国家的无产阶级和革命人民的根本利益，代表着这些国家的未来和希望，是这些国家革命的领导核心。新型的马克思列宁主义政党和组织的产生和发展，是马克思列宁主义反对现代修正主义斗争的重大胜利。
    亲爱的同志们！中阿两党和两国人民在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同战斗中结成了深厚的友谊。这种友谊，是以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党共同锤炼的，是在为共同的理想而进行的革命斗争中经过考验的。我们一贯互相支持，互相帮助，互相学习，互相鼓舞。今后，不论在我们前进的道路上还会遇到什么样的惊涛骇浪，什么样的暴风骤雨，我们两党、两国人民都将继续高举马克思列宁主义的红旗，高举无产阶级国际主义的红旗，肩并着肩，乘风破浪，胜利前进。
    祝阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会圆满成功！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其敬爱的领袖、中国人民亲密的战友恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    中阿两党和两国人民的革命团结和战斗友谊万岁！
    全世界人民的革命大团结万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！
