The Problem of "A Single Peanut"
By Li Zhennan, Guidance Officer of Chen Shandui Brigade, Gaohu County, Guangdong

On the first day of harvesting peanuts, I noticed that some members of the brigade were picking and eating peanuts as they worked, and deliberately not picking up the fallen ones, letting their children pick them up to take home. This reminded me of incidents from a few years ago where some members had taken more than their share of the brigade's peanuts. I thought that if this behavior of harming the collective for personal gain was not corrected, it would seriously affect the development of the collective economy. Therefore, I decided to give a guidance lesson on "A Single Peanut."

One day, I participated in a work team harvesting peanuts. After pulling the peanuts, the entire team sat on a hillside to shell them. I began to give everyone a guidance lesson.

Raising the Question

I asked: What spirit should we learn from Comrade Norman Bethune?
The brigade members all said: We should learn the spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune, who was selfless and dedicated to others.

I said: We must all listen to Chairman Mao's words and learn the spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune, who was selfless and dedicated to others. The other day, Yu Tao, Zhao Ming, and Gen Bo saw that the road to the warehouse was muddy and slippery, so they voluntarily carried sand and stones to pave it. They did a good job!

Everyone discussed their advanced deeds and expressed their determination to learn from them and work hard on the principle of selflessness and dedication to others.

I asked: Does eating a single peanut during the harvest count as selflessness and dedication to others?

Discussion

As soon as I raised this question, the brigade members began to discuss. Some said: "It is selfish, not selfless." Others said: "Eating too much is bad, but eating one peanut is no big deal." Still, others said: "If you work with iron, you eat iron; if you work with copper, you eat copper. Not eating is being foolish."

The brigade members revealed a lot of active thoughts. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses," I guided them, saying: "Last year when we harvested peanuts, I, like everyone else, also ate peanuts. Is it really no big deal to eat one peanut?"

Deng Chunrong was a brigade member who cared for the collective. She said: "If one person eats one peanut, with over two hundred people in the brigade, that would be several pounds. Several pounds a day, and in seven days, it would be over ten pounds. How can we say it is no big deal!" Li Yu Tao followed up: "Unless you don't eat any, once you start eating, it won't be just one peanut. You eat one, I eat three, he eats ten, small numbers add up, and if this continues every day, by the time we harvest one season of peanuts, we would have eaten three or four piculs." After their explanations, the meeting became lively with discussions. Everyone cited many examples to show that eating one peanut was indeed not a small matter.

I asked: What harm does eating too many peanuts cause?

Brigade member Li Huanqing was the first to speak: "We must support socialist construction and the world revolution, and we must actively complete various procurement tasks. If we eat peanuts while harvesting, it will inevitably affect the completion of the tasks, weakening our support for socialist construction and the world revolution. Eating a large amount of peanuts also reduces the collective's income and the members' distribution, affecting the consolidation of the collective economy." Li Runxing added: "Those who harvest peanuts eat them, while those who do other types of work do not get to eat them, which will affect the unity among the members. Children eating too many raw peanuts can also easily get sick." The work team leader Li Zhaozhong said: "Corruption starts with a penny, and the members' selfish thoughts often start with a single peanut."

Before Li Zhaozhong finished speaking, the brigade members started discussing again. Some said: "Stealing a needle when young, stealing gold when old." Others said: "Patch the clothes when they are small, treat the illness when it starts. To change selfish thoughts, we must start with not eating a single peanut."

Summary

Based on everyone's discussion, I summarized the harms of eating the brigade's peanuts into five points: (1) It affects the completion of the state's procurement tasks, weakening the material support for socialist construction and the world revolution; (2) It affects the consolidation and development of the collective economy; (3) It is a manifestation of the bourgeoisie's opportunistic thinking; (4) It affects collective distribution and the improvement of members' lives; (5) It affects unity among the members. Then, I emphasized that eating a single peanut is a manifestation of the desire for personal gain, a selfish behavior. Selfishness is a bourgeois worldview. This worldview must be changed. At this time, I guided the members to review the quotes from "In Memory of Norman Bethune," asking the members to use Chairman Mao's words to examine themselves, to see if they have truly achieved selflessness and dedication to others, to see if they have been extremely responsible in their work by not picking up the fallen peanuts, and to call on the members to listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit, and establish a proletarian worldview.

Making a Rectification Plan

After raising their awareness, I further guided everyone to make a rectification plan with four points: (1) Not to eat or take more than one's share of peanuts; (2) To pick up the fallen peanuts when harvesting; (3) To educate one's children to pick up peanuts and hand them over to the collective; (4) To clean the peanuts of dirt during the harvest.

Because the members had raised their awareness, everyone executed the rectification plan very well. That afternoon, the entire team picked up over twenty pounds of fallen peanuts, and no one ate any peanuts.

My Experience

How to give a good guidance lesson during the busy farming season? My experience is: (1) Grasp the root, start from the specific problems of the time and place, and raise the problem to the level of worldview; (2) Be concise and precise, focus on active thoughts, be targeted, learn one quote, solve one problem; (3) Learn actively and use actively, create forms suitable for field guidance; (4) Use the method of induction, first raise the question, guide the members to discuss, and then summarize and raise the level. Do not use the method of a teacher teaching students; (5) The guidance officer must both teach and set an example, put oneself in the picture, and reveal one's thoughts.

    “一粒花生”问题
    广东高鹤县陈山大队辅导员　李振南
    队里收获花生的第一天，我发现有些社员边收边吃，而且故意不拾落粒，让自己的孩子跟着拾回家。联想起前几年一些社员多吃多占队里花生的事，我想，这种损公利己的行为不改变，会严重地影响集体经济的发展。于是，决定上一堂“一粒花生”的辅导课。
    一天，我参加了一个作业小组收花生。拔完花生以后，全组坐在山岗上摘花生，我就开始给大家上辅导课。
    提出问题
    我问：我们要向白求恩同志学习什么精神？
    社员们都说：要学习白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神。
    我说：我们都要听毛主席的话，学习白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神。前天，玉桃、兆明、根伯等见到仓库的路又烂又滑，便自动挑沙石铺好。他们学得很好啊！
    大家都议论他们的先进事迹，纷纷表示要学习他们在“用”字上狠下功夫，做到毫不利己专门利人。
    我问：收获花生时吃一粒花生，算不算毫不利己专门利人呢？
    讨论
    这么一提，社员们议论纷纷，有的说：“是毫不利人、专门利己。”有的说：“吃多不好，吃一粒无所谓。”有的说：“打铁吃铁，打铜吃铜，不吃就是懵懂。”
    社员们暴露了一大堆活思想，我按照毛主席关于“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，启发道：“去年拔花生时，我和大家一样，都吃过花生。是不是吃一粒花生无所谓呢？”
    邓春容是比较爱护集体的社员。她说：“一人吃一粒花生，全队二百多人，就吃掉斤几了。一天斤几，七天就有十多斤，怎能讲无所谓！”李玉桃接着说：“除非不吃，一吃就不只一粒。你吃一粒，我吃三粒，他吃十粒，小数怕长计，日日如常，收获一造花生，就要吃掉三几担。”经过他们的启发，顿时会场议论纷纷，大家举出了很多事实，说明吃一粒花生确实不是小事情。
    我问：“多吃花生有什么害处？”
    社员李焕卿首先说：“我们要支援社会主义建设，支援世界革命，就要积极完成各项征购任务。如果一边收、一边吃花生，就必然影响任务的完成，削弱了支援社会主义建设和支援世界革命的力量。吃了大量花生，也减少了集体的收入和社员的分配，会影响集体经济的巩固。”李润兴跟着说：“收花生的吃花生，做别的工种的社员没有得吃，还会影响社员之间的团结。小孩多吃生花生，也容易害病。”作业组长李兆忠说：“干部和平演变从一分钱开始，社员的自私自利思想，往往也从一粒花生表现出来。”
    没有等李兆忠讲完，社员又议论开了。有的说：“小时偷针，大时偷金。”有的说：“衫烂从小补，病在起时医，要改造自私自利思想，必须从不吃一粒花生做起。”
    小结
    我根据大家讨论的意见进行了小结，把吃队里花生的害处归纳成五条：（1）影响国家征购任务的完成，削弱支援社会主义建设和世界革命的物质力量；（2）影响集体经济的巩固和发展；（3）是资产阶级占便宜思想的具体表现；（4）影响了集体分配和社员生活的改善；（5）影响社员之间的团结。接着我着重说明，吃一粒花生是贪便宜的思想表现，是一种自私自利的行为。自私自利就是资产阶级的世界观。这种世界观必须要改造。这时，我又辅导社员重温了《纪念白求恩》一文中的语录，要求社员们用毛主席的话，对照检查自己是否做到毫不利己专门利人，检查丢了落粒花生不拣回来，是不是对工作极端的负责任；号召社员们听毛主席的话，学习白求恩同志的精神，树立无产阶级世界观。
    订整改计划
    提高思想后，我进一步启发引导大家，订了四条整改计划：（1）不多吃多占一粒花生；（2）拔花生拾回落粒；（3）教育自己的小孩，拾了花生要交回集体；（4）收获花生时去净泥。
    由于社员提高了思想觉悟，整改计划人人执行得很好。当天下午，全组共拾回花生落粒二十多斤，而且没有一个人再吃花生了。
    我的体会
    如何在农忙中上好辅导课？我的体会是：（1）狠抓根本，从当时当地的具体问题着手，把问题提高到世界观的高度去认识。（2）少而精，抓准活思想，有的放矢，学一条语录，解决一个问题。（3）要学得活，用得活，创造适合于田头辅导的形式。（4）采用诱导的办法，先提出问题，启发社员讨论，然后小结提高。不要用先生教学生的办法。（5）辅导员既言教又身教，要把自己摆进去，亮出思想来。
