Guangzhou Oil and Fat Chemical Factory workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed a spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to revolutionize. Recently, they successfully produced synthetic fatty acids, providing favorable conditions for the development of Guangzhou's soap production and for saving oil resources. During the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, and carried forward the spirit of self-reliance. They overcame the difficulties of inadequate equipment, enabling the synthetic fatty acid workshop to quickly commence production. (Xinhua News Agency)
