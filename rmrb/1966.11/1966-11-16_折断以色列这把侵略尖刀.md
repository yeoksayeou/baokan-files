On the morning of November 13, Israeli troops suddenly launched an armed attack on Jordan. This is another blatant act of aggression by American imperialism using its lackey against an Arab country. The Jordanian army has already given the aggressors a fierce blow.

The Chinese people strongly condemn Israel's banditry and resolutely support the Jordanian people's just struggle against aggression and in defense of their homeland.

American imperialism, in order to suppress the national liberation movements of the Arab countries and maintain its colonial interests in the Arab region, created Israel in Palestine. American imperialism uses this lackey, Israel, to continuously provoke and invade Arab countries. Now, with the support of American imperialism, Israel has brazenly launched an armed attack on Jordan. All this shows that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Arab people, and Israel is the sword of aggression that American imperialism has thrust into the Arab region.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "American imperialism is rampant everywhere, putting itself in a position of enmity with all the people of the world, making itself more and more isolated." American imperialism uses its lackey Israel to run rampant in the Arab region, thereby putting itself in a position of enmity with all the Arab people. After American imperialism directed Israel to attack Jordan, some Arab countries have already declared that the aggression against Jordan is an aggression against all Arab countries. The broad Arab public opinion has also expressed its determination to support the Jordanian people in defeating the aggressors' attack. This shows that the more American imperialism intensifies its aggressive activities in the Arab region, the more it will unite the Arab people in their common struggle against American imperialism and its lackey Israel.

We believe that as long as the Arab people strengthen their unity and fight together, they will surely be able to defeat American imperialism's aggression in the Arab region and break the sword of aggression that American imperialism has thrust into the Arab region: Israel.

    折断以色列这把侵略尖刀
    本报评论员
    十一月十三日清晨，以色列军队突然武装进攻约旦。这是美帝国主义利用它的走狗对阿拉伯国家发动的又一次明目张胆的侵略。约旦军队已经给予侵略者迎头痛击。
    中国人民强烈谴责以色列的强盗行径，坚决支持约旦人民反抗侵略、保卫国土的正义行为。
    美帝国主义为了镇压阿拉伯各国的民族解放运动，维持它在阿拉伯地区的殖民利益，就在巴勒斯坦制造了一个以色列。美帝国主义利用以色列这条走狗，不断对阿拉伯国家进行挑衅和侵略。现在，以色列又在美帝国主义的支持下，悍然对约旦进行武装进攻。这一切表明，美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人，以色列是美帝国主义插在阿拉伯地区的一把侵略尖刀。
    毛主席指出：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。”美帝国主义利用它的走狗以色列在阿拉伯地区横行霸道，就必然把它自己放在同所有阿拉伯人民为敌的地位。在美帝国主义指使以色列进攻约旦以后，一些阿拉伯国家已经宣布，对约旦的侵略就是对所有阿拉伯国家的侵略。广大阿拉伯舆论也纷纷表示，决心要支持约旦人民打败侵略者的进攻。这就表明，美帝国主义越是加紧在阿拉伯地区的侵略活动，就必将使阿拉伯人民同仇敌忾，加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的共同斗争。
    我们相信，阿拉伯人民只要加强团结，共同斗争，就一定能够打败美帝国主义对阿拉伯地区的侵略，折断以色列这把美帝国主义插在阿拉伯地区的侵略尖刀。
