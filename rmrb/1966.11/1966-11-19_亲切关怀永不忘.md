Chairman Mao said: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help one another." In recent months, the people of the capital have excellently carried out Chairman Mao's instruction in their activities of receiving revolutionary teachers and students from other provinces. With fervent class feelings, they have received revolutionary youngsters from all over the country, giving them a vivid lesson in class love and further strengthening their love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They say: "It is warmest by Chairman Mao's side!" They are determined to forever remember Chairman Mao's warm care, to better listen to Chairman Mao's words, to care about state affairs, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Many revolutionary teachers and students from other provinces who came to Beijing have written to our newspaper, praising the revolutionary friendship of the capital's people and expressing their gratitude for the great leader's warm care. We have selected some of these enthusiastic letters to publish here. — Editors

Never Forget the Warm Care

During this revolutionary tour, I left home for the first time and set foot on the vast land of our motherland. Initially, I was a bit timid, fearing that I might encounter many difficulties. However, after coming out, I found that things were completely different. Wherever we went, countless warm hands reached out to us, and people welcomed us as if we were their own family.

In Beijing, we stayed at the reception station of the Workers' Home at Jiuxianqiao outside Dongzhimen. The staff here started working from one o'clock in the morning, bustling in the steaming kitchen for us. When breakfast was served in the morning, they would deliver the food while spreading Mao Zedong Thought. They not only took care of us in every aspect of life but also showed the greatest concern for us politically. They helped us buy Chairman Mao's works, and when everyone received the revolutionary treasure, how happy we were! During our visits and tours, some staff members personally accompanied us, providing political guidance and help.

When some of us fell ill, they cared for and looked after us day and night, just like they would their own children. In short, wherever there was a need, they were there.

We know that the warm reception and care from our revolutionary comrades is the warmth of the motherland, the people, the Party, and the great leader Chairman Mao.

We know that the warm reception and care from our revolutionary comrades is the great hope that the motherland and the people have placed in us, and it is also the great hope that Chairman Mao has placed in us. They hope that we will grow up healthily and quickly in the storms of struggle, becoming reliable successors to the revolutionary cause.

Dearest Leader Chairman Mao, we will not disappoint your sincere expectations. We will strive to study your works during this Cultural Revolution, learn while working, and forge ourselves into revolutionary youth worthy of the Mao Zedong era.

    毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”近几个月来，首都广大人民接待外地革命师生的活动中，很好地执行了毛主席的这一教导。他们以火热的阶级感情，接待来自五湖四海的革命小将，使革命小将们受到了一次生动的阶级友爱的教育，更加增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。他们说：“在毛主席身边最温暖！”他们决心把毛主席的亲切关怀永远铭记在心，更好地听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    许多外地来京革命师生写信给本报，赞扬首都人民的革命情谊，感谢伟大领袖的亲切关怀。我们把这些热情洋溢的信件选编一部分发表在这里。　——编者
    亲切关怀永不忘
    在这次革命大串连里，我第一次离开家乡，走上祖国的辽阔大地。最初，我曾经有些胆怯，担心会遇到许多困难。可是，出来以后，才知道事情完全不是这样。我们每到一个地方，就有无数双温暖的手向我们伸来，人们像接待自己的亲人那样接待我们。
    在北京，我们住在东直门外酒仙桥职工之家的接待站。这里的工作人员从深夜一点钟就开始工作，在热气腾腾的厨房里为我们奔忙。早晨开饭的时候，他们一边送饭菜，一边给我们宣传毛泽东思想。他们不只是在生活上多方照顾我们，而且在政治上给予我们最大的关心。他们帮我们买毛主席著作，当大家拿到革命的宝书，是多么的高兴啊！在进行参观访问的时候，一些工作人员亲自陪我们去，从政治上给我们启发和帮助。
    有的同学病了，他们日夜关心照料，就像照顾自己的子女。总之，只要哪里需要他们，他们就出现在哪里。
    我们知道，革命同志对我们的热情接待，亲切关怀，这是祖国的温暖，人民的温暖，党的温暖，也就是伟大领袖毛主席的温暖。
    我们知道，革命同志对我们的热情接待，亲切关怀，这是祖国和人民对我们寄予莫大的希望，也是毛主席对我们寄予莫大的希望。希望我们在斗争的风雨里尽快地健康地成长，成为可靠的革命事业接班人。
    最敬爱的领袖毛主席，我们一定不辜负您的殷切期望；我们一定要在这场文化大革命里努力学习您的著作，边干边学，把自己锤炼成一个无愧于毛泽东时代的革命青年。
