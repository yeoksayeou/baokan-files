Our great leader best understands the masses, best supports the masses, and is always with the masses. Chairman Mao reviews the Cultural Revolution army of over two million for the seventh time.

On November 11, our most beloved great leader and greatest revolutionary of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, received over two million revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from all over the country and reviewed the Cultural Revolution army they formed. This was Chairman Mao's seventh reception and review of the revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards.

On the 10th, our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, dressed in military uniform and in high spirits, reviewed 600,000 revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards who came from all over the country in 6,000 vehicles and gathered at Tiananmen Square. The young revolutionaries wore red "Red Guards" armbands, each holding a shining red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," forming a magnificent red tide stretching over 30 miles. They shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Chairman Mao repeatedly waved to the cheering crowd and walked to the loudspeaker to shout, "Long live the comrades!"

Chairman Mao also warmly told some responsible comrades on Tiananmen Gate, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat even better."

At 10:00 AM, the military band played the stirring melody of "The East Is Red." The most happy moment of all arrived.

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Song Qingling, Chen Yi, He Long, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Liu Zhiqian, Zhang Chunqiao, and Wu De, ascended Tiananmen Gate. At this moment, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoed through the sky.

Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, announced the start of the reception and review.

Amidst enthusiastic cheers, 6,000 vehicles carrying revolutionary youngsters formed five columns. Each vehicle had a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao, and red slogans hung on both sides. The entire convoy, accompanied by the music of "The Ship Needs a Helmsman," slowly drove towards the surging red sea of Tiananmen Square to accept the review of our most beloved great leader and supreme commander, Chairman Mao.

Thousands of revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from Xinjiang, Uygur, and other ethnic minorities passed through Tiananmen Square with boundless happiness and excitement. Students from Urumqi Experimental Middle School, before coming to Beijing, discussed several times and decided that the evergreen pines on Tian Shan Mountain, which are not afraid of severe cold and heat, best represent the love of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for Chairman Mao. They sent four representatives to walk dozens of miles to Tian Shan Mountain, dug up two of the best pines, and brought them to Beijing. The pines had two red plaques with the words: "Dedicated to the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!" "Wishing our great leader Chairman Mao a long life like the evergreen pines on Tian Shan Mountain!"

The glorious anti-revisionist fighters, the entire group of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union who were recently ordered by the Soviet government to return to China, stood on the viewing platform on the east side of Tiananmen Gate and accepted the review of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They said: Seeing the red sun in our hearts, we feel boundless happiness and warmth! Student Hong Gang said excitedly: Chairman Mao! It is your great thought and wise guidance that have enabled us to achieve victory after victory in the struggle against Soviet modern revisionism. We must study and apply your brilliant works even better, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and carry the struggle against revisionism to the end. Student Hu Debao also opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wrote his oath on the first page: "Chairman Mao, I will definitely master your great thought and follow you to revolution all my life, serving the people of China and the world wholeheartedly."

When Chairman Mao walked to the east and west ends of Tiananmen Gate, the young revolutionaries on the viewing platform and below shouted excitedly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" They said, Chairman Mao understands us the best and supports us the most, and he has timely given us the beacon. When we encounter difficulties in the struggle, we think of nothing but Chairman Mao. With Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing from heaven or earth, and we are not afraid of ghosts and monsters. We must use this most sharp weapon of great democracy to thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, eliminate its poison, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

At 3:00 PM, after the convoy carrying 300,000 revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards passed through Tiananmen Square, the 300,000 young revolutionaries gathered in the square surged towards Tiananmen, cheering wildly and wishing Chairman Mao a long life. Our great leader Chairman Mao repeatedly waved his hat to the viewing platform and the crowd in the square. At this moment, the entire scene was in an uproar, and everyone jumped and cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

On the afternoon of the 11th, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao continued to review the Cultural Revolution army.

Chairman Mao, you best understand the wishes of the revolutionary people, you are in our hearts, you are the red sun in our hearts!

On this day, Beijing was in a state of excitement. Over 150,000 revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from all over the country lined up on the road stretching 26 miles east and west across Tiananmen Square, forming a surging red river.

At 2:30 PM, our great leader Chairman Mao and other central leaders, to the music of "The East Is Red," slowly drove in open-top cars along this red road. Everyone looked up excitedly at Chairman Mao, and every red heart turned towards the red sun. People waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Chairman Mao stood tall in the open-top car, repeatedly waving and greeting the cheering crowd. Chairman Mao's continuous review of the Cultural Revolution army over two days was full of energy and joy, greatly encouraging the young revolutionaries.

When Chairman Mao's car slowly passed by the revolutionary student contingents of many ethnic minorities such as Mongolia, Uygur, Tibet, Korea, and Kazakhstan, hundreds of young revolutionaries shouted in different ethnic languages but with a common voice: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" As soon as Chairman Mao's car passed, the young people of various ethnic groups surged to the center of the road to sing and dance freely. The Mongolian young revolutionaries sang, "People say the sun in the sky is the brightest, but it is not as bright as the light of Mao Zedong Thought. All ethnic peoples love you, Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts!"

More than a thousand revolutionary youngsters from the Liyang area of Hunan, where Chairman Mao launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising over 30 years ago, accepted Chairman Mao's review on behalf of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Liyang. They saw Chairman Mao and excitedly said that they would definitely learn from Chairman Mao, learn and learn again, go among the masses, and touch reality. In the great winds and waves of the revolution, they would temper themselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Yesterday and today, the great leader Chairman Mao reviewed the revolutionary youngsters who came to Beijing on foot from Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and other provinces and regions. These revolutionary pioneers went out of the small classroom of the school and into the big classroom of society, taking the broad masses of workers and peasants as their teachers. Along the way, they saw the touching scenes of Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in people's hearts and felt extremely excited. A "Red Guards Long March Team for Mao Zedong Thought" consisting of ten Red Guards from the 16th Middle School in Jinan, Shandong, visited 14 counties and cities, visited the poor, and asked old poor peasants and old cadres to tell their family histories and village histories. They said, "Let these people who have suffered from the bitterness of the old society personally teach us the class struggle, which gave us the most vivid and profound education." They also said that Chairman Mao supports us to go on foot to connect, which is the most intimate care. We must go to the great winds and waves to temper ourselves, establish a worldview of communism with a public spirit, and be good students of Chairman Mao.

The meeting on the 10th was also attended by responsible persons from various sectors, including: Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Dingcheng, Xiao Jinguang, Deng Zihui, Zhang Yunyi, Yang Xiufeng, Qian Ying, Xu Guangda, Zeng Shan, Zhao Erlu, Lü Zhengcao, Wang Shusheng, Zhang Jingwu, Xie Juezai, Yang Yong, Zhang Zongxun, Li Tao, Chen Qihuan, Chen Manyuan, Li Zhimin, Liu Lanbo, Su Zhenhua, Liao Hansheng, Xu Bing, Chen Zhengren, Zhao Yimin, Kong Yuan, Zhang Aiping, Yao Yilin, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Xu Licheng, Yuan Ziqin, Fu Zhong, Zhang Chuming, Li Zuopeng, Wu Faxian, Yu Lijin, Wu Kehua, Chen Renqi, Cui Tianmin, Huang Zhiyong, Chen Shizhang, Tan Furen, Jiang Wen, Huang Wenming, Li Zhen, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Huang Zuozhen, Li Tianhuan, Kong Shiquan, Zhong Chibing, Zhou Shidi, Guo Tianmin, Yang Zhicheng, Tan Guan, Fu Qiaotao, Wang Hongkun, Hu Chi, Peng Fuqiu, Li Xin, Xie Pingzhong, Wang Li, Guo Benyu, Mu Xin, Yao Wenyuan, Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, Zhang Zhizhong, Abo Awan Jinmei, Zhou Jianren, Zhou Rongxin, Ji Pengfei, Yu Quli, Gu Mu, Yang Qiqing, Liu Wenhui, Hui Zhongquan, Xu Jinqiang, Duan Junyi, Liu Jie, Wu Rongfeng, Fang Qiang, Wang Bingzhang, Zhong Ziyun, Li Siguang, Kuang Fuzhao, Liu Yumin, Lai Jifu, Jiang Guangnai, Qian Zhiguang, Kong Xiangzhen, Xu Yunbei, Sun Daguan, Zhu Lifan, Wang Zigan, Fu Zuoyi, Yuan Baohua, Wu Bo, Sha Qianli, Chen Guodong, Wang Lei, Lin Haiyun, Xiao Wangdong, Zhang Taiyi, Chu Tuonan, Xie Fumin, Xue Muqiao, Ding Laiwu, Hu Lijiao, Wang Dongxing, Zeng Die, Li Renlin, Xie Youfa, Wang Ping, Sun Zheng, Jiang Xuebin, Tang Pingzhu, Liu Zuchun, Ma Quangu, Wang Daoyi, Cao Yiyou, Gao Chongmin, Cai Tingtai, Shen Yanbing, Li Dezhen, Jie Xuegong, Su Qianyi, Ma Li, Yong Wentao, Ding Guoyi, etc.

    毛主席在天安门城楼上，还亲切地对参加接见的一些负责同志说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    上午十时整，军乐队奏响了激动人心的《东方红》乐曲。人们渴望的最最幸福的时刻来到了。

    数千名新疆维吾尔等民族的革命师生和红卫兵，怀着无限幸福、无比激动的心情通过天安门广场。乌鲁木齐实验中学的革命师生，在来京前，经过几番讨论，认为天山上的青松不畏严寒酷热，万古长青，最能体现新疆各族人民热爱毛主席的心。他们派了四名代表步行几十里登上天山，刨了两棵最好的青松带到北京。青松上系着两块红牌，上面写着各族人民的心里话：“献给伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党！”“敬祝伟大领袖毛主席像天山上的青松万寿无疆！”
    光荣的反修战士，最近被苏联政府无理勒令回国的我全体留苏学生，这一天站在天安门东侧的观礼台上，接受了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。他们说：见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们感到无限幸福，感到无比温暖！留苏学生洪钢激动地说：毛主席啊毛主席！是您的伟大思想，是您的英明教导，使我们在同苏联现代修正主义的斗争中，取得了一个又一个胜利。我们一定要更好地活学活用您的光辉巨著，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把反对修正主义的斗争进行到底。胡德宝同学还打开《毛主席语录》，在扉页上写下了自己的誓言：“毛主席啊，我一定要把您的伟大思想学到手，跟着您干一辈子革命，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。”
    当毛主席走向天安门城楼东西两端时，观礼台上下的革命小将们激动地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”他们说，毛主席最了解我们，最支持我们，及时给我们点亮了指路明灯。我们在斗争中遇到困难的时候，什么都不想，只想念毛主席，我们有了毛泽东思想，就天不怕，地不怕，牛鬼蛇神更不怕。我们一定要更好地运用大民主这个最锐利的革命武器，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    下午三时，满载三十万革命师生和红卫兵的车队通过天安门广场以后，聚集在广场上的三十万革命小将涌向天安门，纵情欢呼，祝毛主席万寿无疆。我们伟大的领袖毛主席向观礼台和广场上的人群频频挥帽，这时，全场沸腾起来，人人狂欢跳跃，“毛主席万万岁”的欢呼声响彻天空。
    十一日下午，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，继续检阅文化革命大军。
    毛主席啊，您最了解革命人民的愿望，您和我们心连心，您是我们心中的红太阳！
    这一天，北京全城沸腾。来自全国各地的一百五十多万革命师生和红卫兵，排列在横穿天安门广场东西长达二十六里的大道上，形成了一条欢腾的红色长河。
    下午两点三十分，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和中央其他领导同志，在《东方红》乐曲声中，分乘敞篷汽车，在这条红色大道上缓缓驶行，人人激动地仰望着毛主席，颗颗红心向着红太阳，人们挥舞着《毛主席语录》，齐声欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    毛主席巍然屹立在敞篷汽车上，向欢呼的人群不断地招手致意。毛主席在十日、十一日连续两天接见和检阅文化革命大军，一直是精力充沛，十分高兴，使革命小将们受到了极大的鼓舞。
    当毛主席乘车缓缓驶过蒙古、维吾尔、藏、朝鲜、哈萨克等许多少数民族的革命师生队伍时，数百名小将用不同民族的语言喊出一个共同声音：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”毛主席乘车刚过去，各族青年就涌向大路中心尽情歌舞。蒙古族小将们唱道：“人们说天上的太阳最亮，可是亮不过毛泽东思想的光芒，各族人民热爱您呀毛主席，您是我们心中的红太阳！”
    从毛主席三十多年前发动秋收起义的湖南浏阳地区来的一千多名革命小将，受浏阳贫下中农的委托，满怀喜悦的心情，接受毛主席的检阅。他们见到了毛主席，兴奋地说，我们一定要向毛主席学习，学习，再学习，深入群众，接触实际，在革命的大风大浪中把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    昨天和今天接受伟大领袖毛主席检阅的，有从内蒙古、河北、山东、山西等省区步行来京的许多支红卫兵长征队。这些革命的闯将走出学校的小课堂，到社会的大课堂去，拜广大工农群众为师。长征途中，他们看到了毛泽东思想深入人心的动人情景，感到无比兴奋。山东济南第十六中学十个红卫兵组成的一支“毛泽东思想红卫兵长征队”，经过了十四个县市，访贫问苦，请老贫农、老干部讲家史和村史。他们说：“请这些从旧社会的苦水里熬过来的人亲自给我们上阶级课，使我们受到了最生动、最深刻的教育。”他们还说，毛主席支持我们步行串连，这是对我们最亲切的关怀。我们一定要到大风大浪中去锻炼，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观，做毛主席的好学生。
