China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests the Medan military authorities' ordering of mob violence against our overseas Chinese refugees. We condemn the Indonesian government for creating a bloody incident and disrupting our efforts to repatriate the refugees. The Indonesian authorities must guarantee that such incidents will not happen again; otherwise, they will have to bear all the consequences.

New China News Agency, November 13th - The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on November 13th, strongly protesting the bloody incident in which mobs in Medan, Indonesia, under the orchestration of the local military, attacked Chinese refugees.

The note stated: "On November 9, 1966, over four hundred right-wing mobs in Indonesia, armed with various weapons, launched a savage attack on Chinese refugees who were forcibly gathered in Medan. The mobs, shouting anti-China slogans such as 'Smash the Chinese,' surrounded the refugees' location—the dormitory of the Medan Chinese School—from around 8:30 AM. They stormed into the refugees' living quarters, throwing stones and beating the refugees mercilessly. The elderly, women, and children were not spared. Preliminary reports indicate that over eighty refugees were severely injured, with more than thirty sustaining serious injuries. Even an eighty-year-old refugee was beaten unconscious. The mobs also looted the refugees' belongings. During the attack, Indonesian military personnel who were supposed to be guarding the refugees stood by, watching and allowing the mobs to act without intervention. This inhuman atrocity lasted for over two hours. Some of the mobs did not leave until around 6 PM. This clearly shows that the Medan military authorities were behind this bloody incident. The Chinese government strongly protests this to the Indonesian government."

The note further stated: "It must be pointed out that after suffering severe persecution, these Chinese refugees were forcibly driven from Aceh to Medan and detained en masse. Their livelihoods were cut off, and they longed to return to their homeland. Instead of fulfilling their promise to protect the refugees' lives and property, the Indonesian government continued to persecute them.

"As early as October 10, the Medan military authorities had provoked and attacked the refugees gathered in the dormitory of the Medan Chinese School, arbitrarily arresting over forty, who have not been released to this day. The Chinese government had sent a note to the Indonesian government on October 18, demanding a serious explanation for this incident. Unfortunately, before this case was resolved, the Medan military authorities orchestrated a new bloody incident, which is truly outrageous. We must ask the Indonesian government: Is this how you treat the refugees you have forcibly detained and who are unarmed? Do you intend to kill them all?

"Of particular note is that the Chinese government has sent a second ship to Medan to repatriate the refugees, and the Chinese side is handling the repatriation procedures. At this time, the Indonesian government created this incident, obviously to disrupt the Chinese government's repatriation efforts, which is a very serious step.

"The Chinese government solemnly demands that the Indonesian government severely punish the perpetrators, apologize for this incident, take responsibility for the medical treatment of the injured refugees, compensate for all the losses suffered by the refugees, and guarantee that such incidents will not happen again. If the Indonesian government insists on persecuting the refugees and obstructing and disrupting the Chinese government's repatriation efforts, then all the consequences that arise from this will be the full responsibility of the Indonesian government."

    我外交部最强烈抗议棉兰陆军当局指挥暴徒疯狂袭击我难侨
    谴责印尼政府制造流血事件破坏我接侨工作
    印尼当局应保证今后不再发生类似事件，否则必须承担一切后果
    新华社十三日讯　中国外交部十三日照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，就印尼棉兰地方的暴徒在陆军当局一手策划和导演下疯狂袭击华侨的血腥事件，向印尼政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说：“一九六六年十一月九日，四百多名印度尼西亚右派暴徒，手持各种凶器，疯狂袭击了被强行集中在棉兰的受害华侨。暴徒们从上午八点多钟，就严密包围了难侨所在地——棉兰华侨中学宿舍，狂喊‘粉碎支那人’等反华口号。他们冲进难侨居住的地方，有的用石块疯狂地投掷难侨，有的追逐难侨进行围殴毒打，连老弱妇幼都不放过。据初步了解，有八十多名难侨被打得头破血流，其中三十多名难侨身负重伤，连一位八十高龄的难侨也被打昏倒地，不省人事。暴徒们还抢走了难侨仅有的一些财物。当暴徒们行凶时，看管难侨的印度尼西亚陆军人员在旁观看，纵容暴徒逞凶，毫不制止。这场惨无人道的暴行持续两个多小时之久。一部分暴徒一直闹到下午六时许才离去。这充分说明这次血腥事件是棉兰陆军当局一手策划和导演的。中国政府对此向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。”
    照会说：“必须指出，这批华侨在遭到严重迫害后，又被强行从亚齐地区驱赶到棉兰集体监禁起来。他们生计断绝，渴望返回祖国。印度尼西亚政府不但不履行保证他们生命财产安全的诺言，反而对他们继续进行百般迫害。
      “早在十月十日，印度尼西亚棉兰军事当局，就对被集中在棉兰华侨中学宿舍的受害华侨进行挑衅和逞凶，无理逮捕了四十多名，至今还没有释放。中国政府十月十八日曾就此事件照会印度尼西亚政府提出严正交涉。不料此案未了，棉兰陆军当局又策划了新的流血事件，实在令人愤慨。我们要问印度尼西亚政府，你们采用这种极端残暴的手段来对付被你们强行集中手无寸铁的受害华侨，就是你们的英雄行为吗？你们一定要把这批受害华侨置于死地而后快吗？
    “特别值得注意的是，中国政府第二次派出接运难侨回国的船只正在棉兰港口，中国方面正在办理接运难侨回国事宜，印度尼西亚政府在这个时候制造这次事件，显然是为了破坏中国政府的接侨工作，这是一个十分严重的步骤。
    中国政府严正要求印度尼西亚政府严惩凶手，对此事进行道歉，负责医疗受伤难侨，赔偿难侨所受的一切损失，保证今后不再发生类似事件。如果印度尼西亚政府一意孤行，继续迫害华侨和阻挠破坏中国政府的接侨工作，那么由此而引起的一切后果，应由印度尼西亚政府负完全责任。”
