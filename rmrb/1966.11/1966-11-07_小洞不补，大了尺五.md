Chairman Mao says: Because we serve the people, we should not fear criticism when we have shortcomings. Anyone can point out our mistakes. As long as you are correct, we will correct them.

A Small Hole Unrepaired Becomes a Five-Chi Gap

Chen Taili (accountant of Xiaowan Production Brigade): I have been a cadre for over ten years and have never received severe criticism. During the socialist education movement, some community members criticized me for not distinguishing between enemies and friends; some said I did not have the people in my eyes; some said I did not care about the collective, only about myself. At first, I thought: This is trouble for me; I felt embarrassed, angry, and wronged, blaming myself for becoming a cadre.

Later, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, we should not fear criticism when we have shortcomings. Anyone can point out our mistakes." This passage gave me great education. Using the standard of serving the people to measure myself, I found that all my past mistakes were harmful to the people's interests. The community's criticism was correct. If not criticized, it would cause greater losses. I further thought: My mistakes are so serious, why did the community not criticize me in the past? This time the community criticized me, why couldn't I accept it? Thinking and thinking, it was all because of individualism, not taking the correct attitude towards criticism. Being wronged is being wronged by individualism; being angry is the anger of individualism; being embarrassed is the embarrassment of individualism. The more I thought, the more I felt that individualism was deadly. Awareness improved, and I decided to overcome individualism and actively admit my mistakes to the community. Originally, the community elected me to continue as the accountant, but I refused; now I want to do a good job of the accounting work with all my heart.

Chen Yunzhi (deputy political instructor of the militia brigade): In the past, I was happy to hear praise but angry to the point of crying when criticized. Last October, the poor and lower-middle peasants' association held a meeting, and out of seven people, six criticized me. After hearing everyone's criticisms, I always thought negatively: Who had a bad attitude, who was making a mountain out of a molehill, who was wronging me. Thinking and thinking, I couldn't sleep all night. The next morning, I told the comrade who came to our village to help with the work: "I work so hard, I don't get praised, and I still get criticized. I won't do it anymore." This comrade patiently educated me and gave me a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," asking me to study it carefully. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we not sacrifice any personal interests and abandon any mistakes?" I read this passage and felt that my fear of criticism was wrong. The community gave me advice to help me clean up the dust. I should learn from the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs, not fear sacrificing any personal interests, and humbly accept the community's advice. I also thought: The community criticized me for my progress, I should not care about others' attitudes; even if it is a small problem, being criticized strictly is good; for small shortcomings, it is like a torn piece of clothing, "A small hole unrepaired becomes a five-chi gap." Thinking this way, I felt much better. I actively made a self-criticism in the poor and lower-middle peasants' association, and everyone also encouraged me to correct my shortcomings and make better progress.

### “小洞不补，大了尺五”

    毛主席说：因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。
    “小洞不补，大了尺五”
    陈太礼（下湾生产队会计）：我当了十多年干部，没有受过严厉的批评。在社会主义教育运动中，有的社员批评我敌我不分；有的说我眼睛里没有群众；有的说我不顾集体，只顾个人……。开始我想：这是找我的麻烦；感到丢了脸，呕了气，吃了亏，埋怨不该当干部。
    后来，我学习了《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。”这段话给我很大的教育。我用为人民服务这条尺子来量自己，才发现自己过去那些错误，条条都是损害人民利益的。群众批评得对。再不批评，就会造成更大的损失。我又进一步想：我错误这么严重，群众过去为什么不批评我？这次群众批评了，我为什么接受不了？想来想去，就是个人主义作怪，对批评没有抱正确的态度。吃亏，是吃了个人主义的亏；呕气，是呕了个人主义的气；丢脸，是丢了个人主义的脸。越想越感到个人主义害死人。觉悟提高了，就下决心克服个人主义，主动向群众检讨了自己的错误。原来群众选我继续当会计，我不干；现在我要全心全意把会计工作搞好。
    陈运智（大队民兵副教导员）：以前，我听到表扬就满高兴，受了批评就气得哭。去年十月，贫协小组开会，连我七个人，有六个向我提意见。听了大家的批评意见，我总往歪处想：谁的态度不好，谁是“小题大做”，谁是冤枉我。想来想去，一夜没睡着觉。第二天清早，我对到我们村帮助工作的同志说：“我工作这么积极，得不到表扬，还要挨批评，我不干了。”这位同志耐心地对我进行教育，送给我一本《毛主席语录》，要我好好学习。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我读到这一段话，就觉得自己害怕批评是错误的。群众向我提意见，是为了帮助我打扫灰尘。我应该学习革命先烈的精神，不怕牺牲任何个人利益，虚心接受群众的意见。我还想：群众批评我，是为了我进步，我不应该计较别人的态度；即便是小问题，批评得严格一点也有好处；对于小缺点，就像衣服破了一样，“小洞不补，大了尺五”。这么一想，心里就痛快了。我主动在贫协小组里作了自我批评，大家也鼓励我改正缺点，更好地进步。
