The Albanian wheat variety, Albanian No. 2, planted on the Qinghai Plateau this year, generally yielded excellent results. The highest-yielding areas produced over a thousand jin per mu.

Albanian No. 2 wheat was first brought to the Qinghai Plateau in 1957. Originally a winter wheat variety, it faced challenges in surviving the harsh winters of Qinghai. Following the teachings of Chairman Mao, local farmers and scientists overcame numerous difficulties through continuous practice. They discovered the growth patterns of this new variety, adapting it to spring planting and autumn harvest, transforming it into a spring wheat. They also gradually adapted it to the soil and climate of Qinghai. Over the years, the planting area of this high-yielding wheat variety has steadily expanded. According to statistics, this year, many wheat-producing areas in Qinghai Province have planted Albanian No. 2 over 70% of the total wheat area, with an average yield of around 500 jin per mu.

    青海高原阿尔巴尼亚良种小麦丰收
    平均亩产达五百斤左右，最高的达一千多斤
    据新华社西宁二日电　今年青海高原种植的阿尔巴尼亚良种小麦阿尔巴尼亚二号，一般都获得了很好的收成，产量最高的地方，亩产达到一千多斤。
    阿尔巴尼亚二号小麦是一九五七年第一次运上青海高原的。它原是冬小麦，青海气候高寒，麦类作物越冬困难，这里的农民和科学家遵循毛主席的教导，通过不断实践，克服重重困难，摸索到这一新品种的生长规律，把它改为春播秋收，变成了春小麦；并使它逐渐适应于青海的土质和气候。几年来，这种良种小麦的种植面积逐年扩大。据统计，今年青海省许多小麦产区种植阿尔巴尼亚二号的面积，已占全部小麦面积的百分之七十左右，亩产量可达五百斤左右。
