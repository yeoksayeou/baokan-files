During our long march, we always followed Chairman Mao's teachings, caring for, loving, and helping each other, ensuring that not a single comrade was left behind.

The weather suddenly changed, and our comrade Chen Yaomin fell ill with a cold. Everyone noticed that he was struggling to walk, so we immediately helped him carry his bedding and bag. Some comrades took off their coats and gave them to him to wear. We encouraged him with Chairman Mao's quotations, helping him to continue forward.

A horse-drawn carriage came by. Some comrades repeatedly urged him to get on the carriage, and the old driver also insisted he should. At first, he refused, but after our persistent encouragement, he recited Chairman Mao's words: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it will crush all enemies and never yield to them." He then said, "I am a long march warrior, can I yield to such a small illness?" Our comrades were moved by his words and took good care of him, together reaching our destination of Zhao Gezhuang that day and staying at the home of a middle peasant, Li Grandpa. In the evening, Li Grandpa told us his family's tragic history, giving us a good class education lesson. At night, the comrades covered Chen Yaomin with their coats and blankets, telling him to rest well. In the morning, he woke us up, eager to continue the journey. We asked him how he was feeling, and he said, "It's nothing serious, I can definitely hold on!" At around four in the morning, we set off.

After walking for a while, Chen Yaomin saw that because of his illness, he was slowing down the entire team. He said to everyone, "I won't hold you back anymore. Give me my bag, you all go ahead! As long as I have a bit of strength, I will definitely make it to Chairman Mao's side!" The comrades were moved and said, "No! We can't leave you behind! We started with eight people, and we will all reach Chairman Mao's side together!" A few comrades discussed and decided to take turns carrying him. Although everyone was very tired, to ensure no comrade was left behind, what difficulties could we not overcome? Chen Yaomin, after being persuaded by his comrades, lay on a comrade's back, tears streaming down his face. In this way, when one comrade got tired, another would take over, and the team continued to move forward without stopping.

That day, we arrived at Han Gezhuang and found a doctor who gave Chen Yaomin an injection. During the rest period, we studied Chairman Mao's quotations again: "We all come from different parts of the country, united by a common revolutionary goal. ... All revolutionaries must care for, love, and help each other." This time, we felt the words even more deeply.

It was thanks to Chairman Mao's teachings that we all finally reached Beijing successfully.

    长征途中，我们时刻按照毛主席的教导，互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，做到了
    不让一个战友掉队
    天气突然变化，我们的战友陈幼敏同学感冒了。大家发现他走路吃力，立即帮助他背被子，拿提包；有的同学把自己的大衣脱下来给他披上。同学们用毛主席语录鼓舞着他，帮助他继续前进。
    一辆马车过来了。一部分同学几次劝他坐车，赶车的老大爷也要他上车。开始他只说不坐，后来同学们还是不停地劝他，他就给我们读开了毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”接着，他说：“我是个长征战士，能在这点小病面前屈服吗？”同学们被他的话所感动，都亲切地照顾着他，一起到达了当天的目的地赵各庄，住到了一位下中农李大爷家里。晚上，李大爷为我们讲了他的血泪家史，给我们每个人上了一堂很好的阶级教育课。夜里，同学们把自己的大衣和被子给陈幼敏盖上，要他好好休息。早晨，他叫醒我们，要继续前进。大家问他病怎么样，他说“不要紧，一定能坚持到底！”四点多钟，我们就出发了。
    走了一段路，陈幼敏看到由于自己生病，拖累了整个队伍也走得很慢，便对大家说：“我不连累你们了，把背包给我，你们先走吧！我只要有一点力气，一定能走到毛主席的身边！”同学们激动地说：“不能！不能丢下你一个人！我们八个人一起出来，就要八个人一起走到毛主席跟前！”几个同学商量了一下，决定轮流背着他走。虽然大家都走得很累了，可是为了不让一个战友掉队，我们有什么困难不能克服呢！陈幼敏经过同学们再三说服，趴在战友的背上，激动得眼泪不住地滴在战友的肩上。就这样，一个同学累了，换一个同学再背，队伍继续不停地前进。
    当天，我们到达韩各庄，找到了医生，给陈幼敏打了针。在休息的时候，大家又一次学习了毛主席语录：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”这一次学习这段话，大家感到更加亲切了。
    就是靠了毛主席的教导，我们终于全部胜利地走到了北京。
