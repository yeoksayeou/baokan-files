Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun,
Wherever it shines, it brings light.
Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun,
It is the political grain, the nourishment.
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought,
Its power is greater than atomic weapons.
It is the torch that drives away darkness,
An irresistible force against imperialism.

Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun,
Day and night, use it to arm your thoughts,
Sweep away the darkness, move mountains across the ocean,
Fear neither hardship nor death, strive for revolution and liberation!

Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun,
With it, your eyes will shine brighter,
It is the sharp sword and spear that the reactionaries and imperialists fear the most.

Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun,
It illuminates our path forward.
Carry it with you as you go up the mountains and down the valleys,
Devote your life to the revolution!

Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun,
Always use it to arm yourself.
For the revolution, dare to climb the mountain of knives,
Forever keep your youthful spirit strong.

Mao Zedong Thought is like the red sun,
Like a giant standing tall in the East,
Dispelling the fog and revealing the light,
Changing the entire world!
