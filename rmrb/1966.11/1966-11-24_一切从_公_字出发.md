Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Comrade White. Chairman Mao said: "We all should learn from his spirit of having no self-interest. From this point, one can become greatly beneficial to the people." This passage is the highest directive for us to transform our worldview. Starting from the "Public" Character to Face the Future

When I first enlisted, I often regarded fame, wealth, and status as my future. Initially, I was assigned to the guard unit, and I felt satisfied. I thought, every day besides standing guard and sentry duty, there was plenty of time to study politics and culture. Soon, the mission became intense, and my physical condition was weak, training results were poor, and I did not make it to the "Five Good" evaluation at the end of the year. Many of my fellow recruits progressed faster than me. Thus, I felt there was no future and wanted to go home. Later, I studied articles like "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and realized that a true revolutionary always links their future with the future of billions of people, always regards the revolution as their only future. They consider the future from the perspective of the "public"; while I considered the future from the perspective of the "private." Different starting points lead to vastly different results. My awareness improved, and I made up my mind to follow Chairman Mao's words and strive to cultivate a spirit of having no self-interest.

This spring festival, my wife came to the unit to take care of our sick child. During the holiday, it was a busy time for guard duty. Initially, I thought: "Spend more time taking care of the child, get the illness treated quickly, and save the trouble and expense of going home." However, there were few old soldiers in the squad, and I really couldn't find the time. At this moment, a struggle began in my mind: from which point should I start? I thought: Without the revolutionary future, there would be no future for the working people. If it weren't for liberation, how could my child go to a big hospital for treatment? I must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, start from the "public" character, and become someone like Norman Bethune. Thus, I persuaded my wife to take care of the child, allowing me to complete the holiday duty.

Starting from the "Public" Character to Face Work

Sometimes I thought, after serving for six years, it's almost time for demobilization. Let's start over on another post! With this "getting by" mindset, I drew a small circle around my responsibilities at work. A day is just about leading the squad on guard duty, participating in public duties, and doing a bit extra feels like an "additional burden." What is the responsibility of a Communist Party member and revolutionary soldier? The deeds of Lei Feng gave me great inspiration. Comrade Lei Feng was an ordinary soldier, but he not only did his work in the company but also did it wherever he went. He started from the "public" character, regarding the revolution as his responsibility. I started from the "private" character, gradually regarding the revolution as an extra task. Two starting points reflect two worldviews.

Later, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly established the "public" character, and fiercely fought against the "private" character. In the squad, I voluntarily acted as the platoon leader's "advisor," being a "broad-minded" person. For a period, the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader did not assign me to the night watch, so I voluntarily applied and took over. I will always start from the "public" character, do the revolution for life, and study and spread Mao Zedong Thought for life.

Starting from the "Public" Character to Face Happiness

In the past, although I was relatively frugal and simple in life, sometimes it was out of consideration for my personal and family life. Later, I gradually realized that such frugality and simplicity had not escaped the "private" small circle. After studying the three articles "In Service of the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," I further realized that whether one can consciously maintain a frugal and simple style is essentially whether one can maintain a proletarian stance and feelings, whether one can keep the "public" character at the forefront, and whether one can solve the problem of what true happiness is from a worldview perspective.

I felt: Starting from the "public" character, from the interests of the people of the whole country and the world revolution, one would regard maintaining a frugal and simple revolutionary style as true happiness; one would regard the happiness of the people and comrades as one's own happiness. Last spring festival, my family was waiting for money to spend the festival. But from a letter, I learned that Qingfeng County, Henan, had suffered a disaster, and the people's lives were somewhat difficult, so I sent the ten yuan originally planned to send home to the Qingfeng County People's Committee.

Once, I went to the store to buy a toothbrush, picked one, and then hesitated. My toothbrush could still be used for a few more months, why rush to buy a new one? At this moment, I realized that in recent days, I had started to compare my life with others, the more I compared, the more I felt my poverty, and there was a bit of a bourgeois thought of pursuing material enjoyment. Thinking of these, I returned the toothbrush to the salesperson.

Every time I deal with such matters, proletarian thought defeats bourgeois thought, and I feel very happy. Because this can ensure that I prevent extravagance in life and prevent revisionism in politics. I feel that being a thorough revolutionary who never fades, serving the people of the whole country and the whole world for life, is the greatest happiness!

    一切从“公”字出发
    李运生
    毛主席教导我们，要向白求恩同志学习。毛主席说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”这段话是对我们改造世界观的最高指示。从“公”字出发对待前途
    我刚刚入伍的时候，常常把名利地位看成是自己的前途。开始把我分配到警卫队，我觉得还称心。心想，每天除了站岗放哨，学政治、学文化的时间还很多。不久，执行任务紧张了，自己身体又弱，训练成绩差，年终五好也没评上；一块入伍的，很多人都比我进步快。于是我就感到没奔头，想回家去。后来，我学习了《纪念白求恩》等文章，才认识到，一个真正的革命者，总是把自己的前途，同亿万人民的前途紧紧联系在一起，总是把革命当作自己唯一的前途。他们考虑前途，是从“公”字出发的；而我考虑前途，却是从“私”字出发的。出发点不同，结果就大不一样。认识提高了，我就下定决心，听毛主席的话，努力培养自己毫无自私自利之心的精神。
    今年春节，我爱人来队给孩子看病。假日期间，正是警卫工作紧张的时刻，开始我想：“多抽会儿时间，照料孩子，把病快看好，省得回家再费钱费事。”但是，班里的老战士少，自己实在抽不出时间。这时候，在我思想上就展开了一场从哪点出发的斗争。我想：没有革命的前途，就没有劳动人民的前途，要不是解放了，自己的孩子，怎么能到大医院里看病呢？我一定要照毛主席的指示办事，从“公”字出发，做一个白求恩那样的人。于是我说服了爱人，由她照料孩子，让我坚持完成了假日的执勤任务。从“公”字出发对待工作
    有时我想，当兵六年，快复员了，到别的岗位上重打锣鼓另唱戏吧！有了这种“混”的想法，工作上就把自己职责的圈子划得很小。一天就是带班放哨，参加个公差勤务，干点别的，就觉得是“额外负担”。一个共产党员、革命战士，究竟什么是份内责任呢？雷锋的事迹给了自己很大启发。雷锋同志是普通一兵，但他不但把工作做在连队里，而且走到哪里就做到哪里。他从“公”字出发，把革命当成自己的责任。我从“私”字出发，逐渐把革命当成份外的事。两个出发点，反映了两种世界观。
    以后，我按照毛主席的指示，大立“公”字，狠斗“私”字。在班里，我自觉地当班长的“参谋”，做一个“管得宽”。有一段时间，班长副班长不派我站晚上的哨，我就主动申请，主动代理。我要永远从“公”字出发，干一辈子革命，学习和传播一辈子毛泽东思想。从“公”字出发对待幸福
    过去，自己虽然在生活上比较艰苦朴素，有时却是出于对个人和家庭生活的考虑。后来我逐步认识到，这样的艰苦朴素，并没有脱出“私”字的小圈子。学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等三篇文章，我进一步认识到，能不能自觉地保持艰苦朴素的作风，实质上是能不能保持无产阶级的立场和感情，能不能保持“公”字当头，能不能从世界观上解决什么是真正的幸福的问题。
    我感到：从“公”字出发，从全国人民和世界革命的利益出发，就会把保持艰苦朴素的革命作风，当成真正的幸福；就会把人民的幸福、同志的幸福看做是自己的幸福。去年春节，我家里等着用钱过节。但我从家信中知道了河南清丰县遭灾，人民生活有些困难，我就把原来打算寄回家里的十元钱，寄给了清丰县人民委员会。
    有一次，我去商店买牙刷，选好了又犹豫起来。自己用的牙刷还能用几个月，为什么急着要买新的呢。这时我察觉到，这些日子自己开始和别人比生活，越比越感到自己寒酸，有一点追求物质享受的资产阶级思想苗头。想到这些，我就把牙刷退还了售货员同志。
    每当在处理这类事情上，无产阶级思想压倒了资产阶级思想，自己就感到很幸福。因为这样可以保证从生活上防奢，从政治上防修。我觉得做一个永不褪色的彻底革命派，为全中国和全世界人民服务一辈子，这就是最大的幸福！
