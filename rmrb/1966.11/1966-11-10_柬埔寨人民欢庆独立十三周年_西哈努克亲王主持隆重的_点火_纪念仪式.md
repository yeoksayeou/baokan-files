Cambodian people celebrated the 13th anniversary of their country's complete independence with great joy on November 9. A grand "torch lighting" ceremony was held at the Independence Square in Phnom Penh.

The Independence Square was decorated solemnly and beautifully today. Colorful flags were hung all around the square. The Cambodian national flag, the "Three Towers," fluttered in the wind. The tree-lined avenue leading to the square was crowded with people dressed in festive attire. In the center of the square stood members of the Cambodian cabinet, legislators, athletes, and members of the Royal Socialist Youth Union of Cambodia, as well as diplomats from various countries stationed in Cambodia.

At 9:00 AM, the Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, ascended the observation platform of the Independence Monument to light the torch. Accompanying him on the platform were the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Throne, Prince Sisowath Monireth, the President of the National Assembly, Chea San, the President of the Royal Assembly, Prince Norodom Monirith, Prime Minister Lon Nol, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, General Neak Oeur, the heads of diplomatic missions, and the Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia, Chen Chou-liang. Members of the Royal Socialist Youth Union of Cambodia released colorful balloons with slogans attached at this time.

The Sino-Cambodian Friendship Delegation laid a wreath in honor of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for Cambodia's independence. The delegation leader, Zhang Qi, was also invited to ascend the observation platform of the monument.
