A certain unit's Ninth Company in the Kunming Forces conducted a mass "How to Approach" activity, using the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to solve soldiers' ideological problems. The entire company summarized over sixty "How to Approach" experiences. After the leadership of the Kunming Forces promoted these experiences in their subordinate units, they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Kunming, the Ninth Company of a certain unit in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Kunming Forces, in accordance with the spirit of letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves, initiated a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They mobilized the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to summarize experiences on how to correctly approach one's own ideological problems using Mao Zedong Thought. This mass activity of summarizing "How to Approach" effectively mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and to work hard on the "use" aspect. It strongly promoted the self-revolution of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and consciously striving to transform their worldviews. At the same time, because political and ideological work has a broad mass foundation, it can be done more vividly, more concretely, and more effectively.

Recently, after the leadership of the Kunming Forces promoted the experiences of this company in correctly approaching one's own ideological problems using Mao Zedong Thought in their subordinate units, they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers. They said: On the road to ideological revolution, when encountering problems, one should ask oneself "How to Approach," and then, with the problem in mind, study Chairman Mao's works and correctly handle issues according to Chairman Mao's instructions. This is a good method of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and working hard on transforming one's worldview.

The Ninth Company's experiences of "How to Approach" were formed in the process of deeply studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Last year at the end of the year, during the Four Goods evaluation, with the help of the higher-level work team, they mobilized the masses to discuss their own "How to Approach." They first discussed in their squads, then in the company's meeting, discussing both ideological understanding and practical actions, making the discussions lively and vivid. In this way, the Ninth Company summarized over sixty "How to Approach" experiences. Among them are: how to approach the mainstream and countercurrents in the international situation, how to approach class struggles in society, how to approach one's own life, future, marriage, joining the Party or the Youth League, praise and criticism, family issues, the illness or death of relatives, how to approach hard and intense life, how to approach creating a Four Goods company and a Five Goods soldier, how to approach officer-soldier relationships and organizational discipline, etc. The entire company's comrades generally felt that one "How to Approach" experience is one living experience of studying Chairman Mao's works, and one living experience of grasping living thoughts.

After the Ninth Company summarized over sixty "How to Approach" experiences, the masses' self-revolutionary consciousness greatly increased. Whenever they encountered a problem, they would proactively grasp their own living thoughts and use the arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the target of their real thoughts. They said: Before summarizing the experiences of "How to Approach," when they had ideological problems, they always relied on the leadership to grasp them, relying on others to grasp them, and they were passive; after putting "How to Approach" in their minds, they became active in ideological revolution. They deeply felt from practice that: the transformation of one's ideology cannot do without the help of "external factors," but the decisive role is still played by "internal factors." Revolution relies on consciousness, only with consciousness can one better revolutionize, and only by grasping one's own living thoughts can one grasp them quickly, accurately, vividly, concretely, and to the core of the ideological knot. Many soldiers said: "One knows best about one's own thoughts; one knows best where one has knots; if one grasps them oneself, one can grasp them firmly." "If one is the doctor treating one's own ideological illness, one can treat it accurately and timely, seeing immediate results."

In leading the masses to summarize the experiences of "How to Approach," the leadership of the Ninth Company deeply felt that: our era is a great era where workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres and soldiers' demand to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words, to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, and to transform their thoughts is very urgent. The leadership must see this situation, actively create conditions for the masses, mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses to do a good job in the company's political and ideological work, continuously promoting the masses to work hard on self-revolution.

How to actively create conditions and continuously promote the masses' self-revolution? The leadership of the Ninth Company believes that, in addition to vigorously promoting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the leading cadres must "put themselves in" and dare to reveal their thoughts among the masses, truly putting themselves under the supervision of the masses, strictly demanding of themselves, and continuously summarizing their own experiences of "How to Approach." Their spirit of leading self-revolution has powerfully dispelled some soldiers' thoughts of "natural redness" and "gradual progress," becoming a model for the broad masses of soldiers' self-revolution.

    昆明部队某部九连开展群众性“怎样对待”的活动
    用毛泽东思想的锐利武器解决战士的思想问题
    全连总结出六十多个“怎样对待”的经验，昆明部队领导机关在所属部队推广以后，受到广大指战员的欢迎。
    据新华社昆明电  中国人民解放军昆明部队某部九连，本着让群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的精神，在活学活用毛主席著作群众运动中，发动广大指战员，总结怎样用毛泽东思想正确对待自己思想问题的经验。这种群众性的总结“怎样对待”的活动，有效地调动了广大指战员活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫的积极性；有力地促进了广大指战员自我革命，破私立公，努力改造世界观的自觉性。同时，因为政治思想工作有了广泛的群众基础，就做得更活、更细、更加落实。
    解放军昆明部队领导机关，最近在所属部队推广了这个连队总结怎样用毛泽东思想正确对待自己思想问题的经验以后，受到广大指战员的欢迎。他们说：在思想革命化的道路上，遇到问题，就给自己提出一个“怎样对待”，然后带着问题去学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席的指示去正确处理。这是活学活用毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫的一种好办法。
    九连总结“怎样对待”的经验，是在活学活用毛主席著作步步深入过程中形成的。
    去年年终，四好总评时，他们在上级工作组的帮助下，发动群众人人都来谈自己的“怎样对待”。先在班里谈，然后在连的大会谈，既谈思想认识，又谈实际行动，谈得生动活泼。就这样，九连先后总结出了六十多个“怎样对待”的经验。其中有：怎样对待国际形势中的主流和逆流，怎样对待社会上的阶级斗争，怎样对待个人的生死、前途、婚姻、入党入团、表扬批评、家庭问题、亲人病丧，怎样对待艰苦紧张的生活，怎样对待创造四好连队、五好战士，怎样对待官兵关系、组织纪律，等等。全连同志普遍反映，一条“怎样对待”的经验，就是一条学习毛主席著作的活经验，就是一条抓活思想的活经验。
    九连总结出六十多个“怎样对待”的经验以后，广大群众自我革命的自觉性大大提高了。他们每遇到一个问题，都能主动地抓自己的活思想，用毛泽东思想之矢，去射自己现实思想之的。他们说：在没有总结“怎样对待”的经验以前，自己有了思想问题，总是靠领导抓、靠别人抓，自己是被动的；自从脑子里装进了
  “怎样对待”以后，自己在思想革命化中就主动了。他们从实践中深深地体会到：一个人的思想改造，离不开“外因”的帮助，但起决定作用的还是“内因”。革命靠自觉，自觉才能更好地革命，自己抓自己的活思想，才能抓得快，抓得准，抓得活，抓得具体，抓到思想疙瘩上。许多战士说：“自己有什么思想，自己最了解；自己在哪里结了疙瘩，自己最清楚；自己来抓，一抓就抓得住。”“自己当治自己思想病的医生，就能治得准确及时，立竿见影。”
    九连领导上在领导群众总结“怎样对待”的经验中，深深体会到：我们的时代是工农兵直接掌握毛泽东思想的伟大时代，干部战士读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，灭资兴无、改造思想的要求十分迫切。领导必须看到这种形势，积极为群众创造条件，发动群众、依靠群众来做好连队的政治思想工作，不断促进群众在自我革命上用劲。
    怎样积极创造条件，不断促进群众自我革命，九连领导上认为，除了大抓活学活用毛主席著作以外，领导干部要把自己“摆进去”，敢于在群众中亮思想，真正把自己置于群众的监督之下，严格要求自己，不断总结自己“怎样对待”的经验。他们带头自我革命的精神，有力地破除了一些战士的“自来红”、“慢慢来”的思想，成了广大战士自我革命的样板。
