The pig-raising industry in the rural people's communes of Shandong Province has seen continuous development. By the end of September, the total number of pigs in the province had increased by 40% compared to the same period last year, and by 540% compared to 1949. This year, the average household in Linqu County has raised two pigs. Six years ago, the Sanma Commune in Yishui County had only one pig for the entire brigade in Hongshiguan Production Brigade, but now the average person raises two pigs. The development of the pig-raising industry has significantly increased the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland this year, greatly promoting agricultural production; it has also played a significant role in providing meat, improving the lives of urban and rural residents, and increasing exports to support national construction.

    山东养猪事业不断发展
    山东省农村人民公社的养猪事业获得不断发展。到九月底，全省的生猪存栏数比去年同期增长百分之四十，比一九四九年增长五点四倍。临朐县今年平均每户养猪达到两头。六年前全大队还只有一头猪的沂水县三马公社红石官庄大队，现在平均每人养猪两头。养猪事业的发展，使今年的农田施肥量比前几年显著增加，有力地促进了农业增产；在提供肉食、改善城乡人民生活和增加出口、支援国家建设等方面，也起了很大作用。
