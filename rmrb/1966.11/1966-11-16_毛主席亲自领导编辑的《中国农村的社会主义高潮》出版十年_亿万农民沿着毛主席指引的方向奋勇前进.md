Chairman Mao personally led the editing of "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," which has been published for ten years. Hundreds of millions of peasants are advancing courageously along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The 104 articles in the book, for which Chairman Mao wrote commentaries, provide extremely important guidance on class struggle in the countryside, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and political, economic, and cultural work in the countryside after collectivization. This has ensured that our country's countryside has advanced rapidly and healthily along the socialist path. Over the past ten years, it has guided and promoted the consolidation and development of the collective economy and the entire countryside's socialist revolution and socialist construction, creating unprecedented glorious achievements.

Editor's Note: Ten years ago, Chairman Mao personally led the editing of "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside." In particular, the preface and over 100 commentaries written by Chairman Mao for this book are powerful ideological weapons that guide and inspire hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants to follow the socialist path.

Chairman Mao said: "The serious problem is educating the peasants." After the peasants' transition from individual to collective economy, the influence of private ownership and capitalist tendencies will persist for a long time. This requires us Communists to conduct patient, lively, and easily understandable propaganda and education work among the broad masses of peasants who carry the old system's baggage on their backs.

"The political work is the lifeline of all economic work." This famous proposition was put forward by Chairman Mao ten years ago in one of the commentaries in this book. Chairman Mao pointed out that in the countryside, "the basic task of political work is to continuously instill socialist ideas in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." In other words, to eliminate the capitalist elements and establish the socialist elements, to break down private interests and establish public interests.

How to educate the peasants? How to instill socialist ideas in the peasants? The best method is to follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively.

In recent years, in the vast countryside, combined with the socialist education movement, that is, the "Four Clean-ups" movement, a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has surged, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the commune peasants. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, immediate effects have been achieved.

The largest proportion of our country's population is peasants. The strongest and most reliable ally of the proletariat is the peasants. We must further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the vast peasant masses, turning every rural people's commune into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. With hundreds of millions of peasants further armed with Mao Zedong Thought and further achieving thought revolutionization, not only will the countryside's appearance undergo fundamental changes, but it will also greatly promote the new upsurge of the socialist revolution and socialist construction throughout the country.

Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: The book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," personally led in editing by Chairman Mao, has been published for ten years since 1956. Over the past ten years, the vast peasant masses of our country have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have firmly taken the path of collectivization, making the entire countryside advance in great strides. Both the spiritual front and the material front have undergone tremendous and profound changes.

In the first half of 1955, when the vast peasant masses responded to Chairman Mao's call to organize actively, and some regions had already seen the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, some people within the Party underestimated the immense socialist enthusiasm among the peasant masses. Instead of standing at the forefront of the movement to lead the masses forward, they stood behind the movement, complaining that the masses were moving too fast, using various rules and regulations to restrict the masses, seriously hindering the development of the movement. It was at the end of July that year that our great leader Chairman Mao published the article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," criticizing the rightist ideas within the Party regarding the agricultural cooperativization movement, greatly encouraging and supporting the vast peasant masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement formed rapidly and soon swept across the country. By 1956, agricultural cooperativization had been achieved in most regions of the country, basically realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture in terms of production relations. This laid the foundation for the full implementation of agricultural cooperativization in 1957 and the further implementation of the people's communes in 1958.

The publication of the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," personally led in editing by Chairman Mao, is a major event in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our country's countryside. In particular, the commentaries written by Chairman Mao for the 104 articles in the book provide extremely important guidance on class struggle in the countryside, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and political, economic, and cultural work in the countryside after collectivization. These guidelines not only powerfully guided and promoted the agricultural cooperativization movement at that time but also powerfully guided and promoted the consolidation, development, and entire countryside's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past ten years. It is precisely because of Chairman Mao's personal care and wise leadership that our country's countryside has rapidly and healthily advanced along the socialist path, creating many unprecedented glorious achievements. The vast commune members and rural cadres of our country, recalling the ten-year journey and reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings, all feel particularly intimate. In the book, the articles that Chairman Mao commented on, the commune members and cadres have an even greater love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. They all expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and achieve greater victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Reviewing the ten years, people feel particularly intimate about Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and the struggle between the two roads. In the commentary on the article "A Serious Lesson," Chairman Mao said: "The agricultural cooperativization movement, from the very beginning, has been a serious struggle of thought and politics." "After the establishment of the cooperatives, there must still be many struggles before they can be consolidated." In the commentary on the article "Who Says Chicken Feathers Cannot Fly to the Sky," Chairman Mao pointed out: "In China's countryside, an important aspect of the struggle between the two roads is manifested through the peaceful competition between the poor and lower-middle peasants and the rich middle peasants." "Behind the rich middle peasants stand the landlords and rich peasants, who sometimes openly and sometimes secretly support the rich middle peasants." Over the past ten years, cadres and commune members in various places have personally experienced this struggle in the process of advancing and have achieved victory after victory. Cadres and commune members in various places unanimously believe that all these victories have been achieved under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. Cui Fenglu, the Party branch secretary of Nan Cui Village Brigade, Honghe Village Commune, Anyang County, Henan Province, said well: "Ten years of facts have told me that at any time, the Party branch must grasp class struggle and firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Every victory of Nan Cui Village Brigade is a victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, a victory of the socialist road over the capitalist road, in a word, a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought." Cadres and commune members in various places believe that Chairman Mao's commentaries on the articles "A Serious Lesson," "The Direction of 500 Million Peasants," "Who Says Chicken Feathers Cannot Fly to the Sky," and "How Changsha County Gaoshan Township Wutian Agricultural Production Cooperative Transformed from Middle Peasant Dominance to Poor Peasant Dominance" are all sharp weapons for them to defeat class enemies and adhere to the socialist road.

Chairman Mao's commentaries on many articles in "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" provide many important guidelines for strengthening political work in the countryside. In these commentaries, Chairman Mao wrote: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "The cooperatives must emphasize doing good political work. The basic task of political work is to continuously instill socialist ideas in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." "We must believe that the shortcomings or errors of the laboring people can be overcome or corrected through appropriate political work." "As long as we do not relax political work among the peasants in the cooperativization movement and even in a very long period afterward, capitalist tendencies will surge." Chairman Mao taught that political work "must be based on the peasants' life experiences, very concretely and meticulously, and cannot be done in a rough and simple manner. It must be done in conjunction with economic work and cannot be done in isolation." Chairman Mao praised the method of political work described in the article "A Good Experience of Rectifying a Cooperative" - "four comparisons and five accounts," pointing out that this is "a very good method of explaining to the peasants which system is good and which is bad, so that they understand it at a glance." Over the past ten years, wherever Chairman Mao's instructions have been implemented and political work has been emphasized in various rural work, good results have been achieved. Dazhai Brigade, Dazhai Commune, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, and Xia Dingjia Brigade, Daliu Family Commune, Huang County, Shandong Province, as well as many Dazhai-style models on the agricultural front, are all shining examples of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions and highlighting political work in various aspects of work, creating great achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Xiandu Brigade, Longfeng Village, Xiandou Commune, Hua'an County, Fujian Province, following Chairman Mao's instructions, often uses methods such as comparison, accounting, holding class education exhibitions, and lecturing on village and family history to conduct concrete and meticulous political work for cadres and commune members, promoting the thought revolutionization of cadres and commune members, and the collective economy is thriving. In recent years, with the deepening of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, political work in rural areas has become more active, and the spiritual face of the entire countryside is undergoing unprecedented great and profound changes.

Ten years ago, Chairman Mao successively praised the "spirit of poverty" of Zhenxian County, Hebei Province, Wang Guozhan Agricultural Cooperative in two articles' commentaries. Chairman Mao wrote: "Can six hundred million poor people not, through their own efforts, turn into a rich and strong socialist country in a few decades?" This commentary greatly encouraged the peasants of the whole country to take the road of collective prosperity and develop socialist agriculture through self-reliance. Over the past ten years, the "spirit of poverty" has been greatly carried forward throughout the countryside. The self-reliant and hardworking revolutionary spirit of many Dazhai-style agricultural models in various places is the development of the "spirit of poverty." Under the encouragement of this self-reliant and hardworking revolutionary spirit, in 1958, a nationwide high tide of large-scale water conservancy projects emerged; then, the people's communes overcame the enormous difficulties caused by three years of natural disasters and quickly restored and developed agricultural production; immediately after that, various places launched large-scale agricultural basic construction, built stable and high-yield farmland, and significantly changed the appearance of many regions. The "poor cooperative" of ten years ago - Wang Guozhan Cooperative, which is now Jianming Commune, Xipu Brigade, has completely changed its original appearance. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rely on their own hands to transform nature, and have turned a large number of barren lands into fertile fields. They have built a reservoir - Jianming Lake and many small-scale water conservancy projects, increasing irrigated land from more than twenty mu ten years ago to more than eight hundred mu. In addition, they have reclaimed wasteland and planted more than four thousand mu of new forests. When the cooperative was first established, the entire commune had only three donkey legs, but now the entire brigade has seventy-nine large livestock, twelve rubber-wheeled carts, dozens of handcarts, and a large number of new agricultural tools and electrical equipment. Similar to this place, many regions across the country, such as the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Jianghan Plain, Jiangxi red soil hilly areas, northern Loess Plateau, coastal low-lying waterlogged areas, and many gardens and villages in the south and north, have all undergone significant changes. The old traces of small-scale peasant economy that hindered the development of productive forces have disappeared, and new socialist large-scale agricultural land construction has promoted continuous stable and high-yield production.

Through the commentaries, Chairman Mao also provided many important guidelines on a series of issues related to the construction of socialist new countryside, including the rectification and consolidation of the collective economy and related policies and guidelines for production and construction. Chairman Mao emphasized in the commentaries: "The masses harbor a great socialist enthusiasm." "There is a great potential in the peasant masses." He also said: "Socialism not only liberates the laborers and means of production from the old society but also liberates the vast natural world that the old society could not utilize. The people have limitless creativity. They can organize and march to all places and departments where they can exert their strength, march to the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare for themselves." Over the past ten years, various places have implemented Chairman Mao's guidelines, fully mobilized and relied on the masses, greatly mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast peasant masses. They followed Chairman Mao's guidelines, organized and led the masses to march to the depth and breadth of production, comprehensively developing the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In recent years, many communes have also developed small-scale industries with processing as the main focus, expanding the scope of production operations, making the rural economy more prosperous. Two production brigades in Jieji Commune, Feidong County, Anhui Province, have insisted on marching to the depth and breadth of production for ten years, not only significantly increasing grain and cotton production but also greatly developing various sideline occupations such as pig raising, fish farming, lotus root planting, and water chestnut planting. Liuji Commune, Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, Jiaji Village Brigade, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, and Wanyanqing Commune, Shandong Province, and Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, have gradually developed agricultural mechanization, making the entire agricultural economy more prosperous, and rural cultural undertakings have also made significant developments.

Over the past ten years, our country's countryside has undergone tremendous changes through agricultural cooperativization and people's commune-ization, and people's spiritual outlook has undergone a leap. The collective economy has developed and grown healthily. The vast commune members and cadres, recalling the ten-year journey and reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings, especially reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings in "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," deeply feel that every achievement gained on the collectivization road over the past ten years is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This makes them love, believe, and admire Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought even more. On this basis, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has emerged in a new high tide in the countryside across the country, creating a new situation; reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the common language and action of the people. Hundreds of millions of commune members and cadres are determined to advance courageously under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to build a socialist new countryside.

    毛主席亲自领导编辑的《中国农村的社会主义高潮》出版十年
    亿万农民沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进
    毛主席为一百零四篇文章写的按语，对农村的阶级斗争、农业的社会主义改造和集体化后农村的政治、经济、文化工作等，作了极为重要的指示，保证了我国农村在社会主义大道上迅速地健康地向前迈进，十年来指导和推动了集体经济的巩固发展和整个农村的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，创建了空前的光辉业绩。
    编者按：十年前，毛主席亲自领导编辑的《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书，特别是毛主席为这部书写的序言和一百多条按语，是指引和鼓舞我国亿万农民走社会主义道路的强大的思想武器。
      毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”农民在由个体经济改造成为集体经济以后，长时期内，还存在着私有制的影响和资本主义的自发倾向。这就“要求我们共产党人向着背上背着旧制度包袱的广大的农民群众，进行耐心的生动的容易被他们理解的宣传教育工作”。
    “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”这个著名的论点，就是毛主席十年前在这部书的一条按语中提出的。毛主席指出，在农村里，“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向”。也就是说，要灭资兴无，破私立公。
      怎样教育农民呢？怎样向农民灌输社会主义思想呢？最好的办法，就是像解放军那样，按照林彪同志的指示，活学活用毛主席著作。
      几年来，在广大农村里，结合社会主义教育运动，即四清运动，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，大大促进了公社农民的思想革命化，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中，都收到了立竿见影的效果。
      我国人口中占最大比例的是农民，无产阶级最强大最坚固的同盟军是农民。我们一定要在广大农民群众中，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，把每个农村人民公社都办成毛泽东思想的大学校。亿万农民进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来，进一步实现思想革命化，不但会使农村面貌发生根本变化，也必将大大促进全国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新高潮。
    新华社十五日讯　毛主席亲自领导编辑的《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书，从一九五六年出版到现在已经十年了。十年来，我国广大农民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，按照毛主席的教导坚定地走集体化的道路，使整个农村大踏步地向前迈进，无论是精神战线还是物质战线都发生了巨大而深刻的变化。
    一九五五年上半年，当广大农民响应毛主席的号召积极组织起来，部分地区已开始出现农业合作化运动的高潮的时候，党内有些人由于对农民群众中蕴藏着的极大的社会主义的积极性估计不足，不是站在运动的前头积极地领导群众前进，而是站在运动的后面埋怨群众走快了，用种种清规戒律来限制群众，严重地影响了运动的发展。就在这年七月底，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发表《关于农业合作化问题》一文，批判了党内对农业合作化运动的右倾思想，给予广大农民特别是贫农下中农以极大的鼓舞和支持。在毛主席的英明领导下，农业合作化运动的高潮迅猛异常地形成起来，很快就遍及全国。到一九五六年，全国农村绝大部分地区实现了农业合作化，在生产关系方面基本上实现了农业的社会主义改造。这样，就为一九五七年全面实现农业合作化和一九五八年进一步实现人民公社化奠定了基础。
    毛主席亲自领导编辑的《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书的出版，是我国农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的一件大事。特别是毛主席为本书中的一百零四篇文章写的按语，对农村的阶级斗争、农业的社会主义改造和集体化后农村的政治、经济、文化工作等，都作了极为重要的指示。这些指示，不仅有力地指导和推动了当时的农业合作化运动，而且也有力地指导和推动了十年来集体经济的巩固、发展和整个农村的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。正是由于毛主席的亲切关怀和英明领导，才保证了我国农村在社会主义的大道上迅速地、健康地向前迈进，创建了许许多多空前未有的光辉的事业。我国广大公社社员和农村干部回顾十年的历程，重温毛主席的教导的时候，无不感到分外亲切。在书中毛主席加过按语的文章所介绍的那些单位，社员和干部们对毛主席更是无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜。他们纷纷表示要按毛主席的教导，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中夺取更大的胜利。
    回顾十年，人们感到特别亲切的，是毛主席关于阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的教导。毛主席在《严重的教训》一文的按语中说：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”“合作社建立以后，还必须经过许多的斗争，才能使自己巩固起来。”在《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文的按语中，毛主席指出：“在中国的农村中，两条道路的斗争的一个重要方面，是通过贫农和下中农同富裕中农实行和平竞赛表现出来的。”“在富裕中农的后面站着地主和富农，他们是有时公开地有时秘密地支持富裕中农的。”十年来，各地干部和社员在前进的过程中亲身经历了这种斗争，在斗争中取得了一次又一次的胜利。各地干部和社员一致认为，所有这些胜利都是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下取得的。河南安阳县洪河屯公社南崔庄大队党支部书记崔凤梧说得好：“十年来的事实告诉我，任何时候，党支部都要抓阶级斗争，都要坚定地依靠贫下中农。南崔庄大队的每一个胜利，都是无产阶级战胜资产阶级的胜利，都是社会主义道路战胜资本主义道路的胜利，说到底，都是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。”各地广大干部和社员认为，毛主席给《严重的教训》、《五亿农民的方向》、《谁说鸡毛不能上天》和《长沙县高山乡武塘农业生产合作社是怎样从中农占优势转变为贫农占优势的》等文所写的按语，都是指导他们去战胜阶级敌人，坚持社会主义道路的锐利武器。
    毛主席为《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书的不少文章写的按语，对加强农村的政治工作有很多重要的指示。在这些按语中，毛主席写道：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“合作社必须强调做好政治工作。政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。”“我们一定要相信这样一点，即劳动人民中的缺点或者错误，是能够经过适当的政治工作使他们加以克服或者改正的。”“只要我们在合作化运动中，乃至以后一个很长的时期内，稍微放松了对于农民的政治工作，资本主义倾向就会泛滥起来。”毛主席教导说，政治工作“必须根据农民的生活经验，很具体地很细致地去做，不能采用粗暴的态度和简单的方法。它是要结合着经济工作一道去做的，不能孤立地去做。”毛主席表扬了《一个整社的好经验》一文所描写的进行政治工作的方法——“四对比、五算账”，指出这“就是向农民说明两种制度谁好谁坏、使人一听就懂的一种很好的方法”。十年来，凡是贯彻执行毛主席这些指示，在各项农村工作中认真突出政治的地方，都取得了很好的成绩。山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队，山东省黄县大吕家公社下丁家大队，以及农业战线的许多大寨式典型，都是认真执行毛主席指示，在各项工作中突出政治，从而在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面创造出巨大成绩的光辉典范。福建省华安县仙都公社龙峰大队按照毛主席的指示，经常用对比、算账、举办阶级教育展览会和大讲村史、家史等方法，向干部和社员进行具体、细致的政治工作，促使干部和社员的思想日益革命化，集体经济蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。近几年来，随着活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的深入开展，各地农村的政治工作更加活跃，整个农村的社会精神面貌正在发生空前巨大而深刻的变化。
    十年前，毛主席先后在两篇文章的按语中表扬了河北省遵化县王国藩农业合作社勤俭办社的“穷棒子精神”。毛主席写道：“难道六万万穷棒子不能在几十年内，由于自己的努力，变成一个社会主义的又富又强的国家吗？”这个按语给全国农民走集体富裕的道路，自力更生地发展社会主义农业以极大的鼓舞。十年来，“穷棒子精神”在全国农村大大地发扬起来，各地大寨式农业典型的自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，正是“穷棒子精神”的发展。在这种自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神鼓舞下，一九五八年出现了全国规模的大办水利的高潮；随后，人民公社又克服三年自然灾害造成的巨大困难，迅速恢复和发展了农业生产；紧接着，各地又大搞农田基本建设，兴修稳产高产农田，使不少地区的面貌发生了显著变化。十年前的“穷棒子社”——王国藩合作社，也就是现在的建明公社西铺大队，已经完全改变了原来的面貌。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，凭双手改造大自然，把大批薄地改造成了良田。他们大办水利，修了一个水库——建明湖和许多小型水利工程，使水浇地从十年前的二十多亩发展到了八百多亩。另外，他们还改造荒山荒滩，营造了四千多亩新林。刚办社时，全社只有三条驴腿，现在全队有七十九头大牲畜，十二辆胶轮大车，几十辆手推车以及大批新式农具和电动设备。同这个地方一样，全国许多地区，如长江三角洲、珠江三角洲和江汉平原，江西红壤丘陵区、北方黄土高原和沿海低洼易涝地区，以及南北各地的许多田园和村庄，面貌都发生了显著的改变。旧的阻碍生产力发展的小农经济面貌的痕迹已经不存在了，新的社会主义的大农业的农田建设，促进了连续性的稳产高产。
    通过按语，毛主席还对建设社会主义新农村的一系列问题，包括集体经济的整顿巩固和有关生产建设的方针、政策等，作了很多重要的指示。毛主席在按语中强调指出：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”“农民群众中间有很大的潜在能力。”又说：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”十年来，各地执行毛主席的这些指示，充分发动和依靠群众，大大地调动了广大农民群众的积极性和创造性。他们按照毛主席的指示，有组织、有领导地向生产的深度和广度进军，全面发展了农、林、牧、副、渔各业生产。近年来，不少公社还发展了以加工为主的小型工业，扩大了生产的经营范围，使农村经济更加繁荣。安徽肥东县解集公社的两个生产队，十年来坚持不懈地向生产的深度和广度进军，不仅粮棉大增产，养猪、养鱼、种菱、种藕等各种副业都有很大发展。湖北省新洲县刘集公社、山西省汾阳县万年青公社贾家庄大队和黑龙江省的双城县，由于逐步发展了农业机械化事业，整个农业经济更加繁荣，农村的文化事业也有了重大的发展。
    十年来，我国农村经过农业合作化和人民公社化的巨大变革，人们的精神面貌发生了飞跃的变化，集体经济事业健康地发展、壮大起来。广大社员和干部回顾十年经历，重温毛主席的教导，特别是重温毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中的教导，深感十年来在集体化道路上所获得的每一成就，无一不是毛泽东思想的胜利。这使他们对毛主席和毛泽东思想更加热爱、更加信仰、更加崇拜。在这个基础上，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，在全国农村出现了新的高潮，造成了新的局面；读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，成了人们的共同语言和行动。亿万社员和干部决心在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，为建设社会主义新农村继续奋勇前进。
