Thieves Cry "Thief" and Distort Facts to Deceive: Soviet Revisionists Use Commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's Birthday to Viciously Attack China

	New China News Agency, November 14th: Moscow — According to reports from Soviet newspapers, the modern revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union has used the commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's 100th birthday to launch a vicious attack on China.

	The CPSU Central Committee's official newspaper, *Pravda*, published an article on the 12th commemorating Sun Yat-sen, using the tactic of "thieves crying 'thief'" to attempt to shift the blame for the CPSU leadership's sabotage of friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union onto the Chinese Communist Party, who are holding high the banner of opposing imperialism and modern revisionism and firmly opposing the betrayal of Lenin's cause. The article falsely claims that "the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union has been overshadowed by the actions of the Chinese leadership."

	In a recent issue, the Soviet magazine *Abroad* published an anti-China article that absurdly labels China, the pillar of the current anti-imperialist struggle in the world, as "surrendering to imperialism," "ignoring its internationalist duties," "forgetting Sun Yat-sen's teachings," and "striking out against Sun Yat-sen himself." The article also goes to great lengths to equate the Chinese people's revolutionary and just struggle against Soviet modern revisionism with the past anti-Soviet actions of Chinese warlords.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership has also used various other "commemorative" activities to steal the friendly sentiments Sun Yat-sen once expressed towards the Soviet Union led by Lenin, engaging in deception and brazenly attacking China. At a so-called commemorative meeting for Sun Yat-sen's birthday held in Moscow on the 11th, the chairman of the commemorative committee, poet Gikhonov, shamelessly portrayed the CPSU revisionist leadership, which is colluding with U.S. imperialism, betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people, and attempting to form an anti-China encirclement around China, as "firmly adhering to a policy of friendship with the Chinese people and joint anti-imperialism."

	Recently, the Soviet *Izvestia*, *New Times* magazine, and other central newspapers, as well as some local newspapers, have also used the commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's birthday as a pretext to stage anti-China farces. On the 11th and 12th alone, various newspapers in Moscow published 16 so-called commemorative articles for Sun Yat-sen, six of which openly attacked the Chinese Communist Party or Chinese leaders, while the rest used veiled language to join in the anti-China clamor.

### 贼喊捉贼　颠倒黑白　招摇撞骗  苏修假借纪念孙中山诞辰大肆反华

    贼喊捉贼　颠倒黑白　招摇撞骗
    苏修假借纪念孙中山诞辰大肆反华
    新华社十四日讯  莫斯科消息：据苏联报刊报道，苏联现代修正主义领导集团假借纪念孙中山先生诞生一百周年大肆反华。
    苏共中央机关报《真理报》十二日发表“纪念”孙中山先生诞辰的文章，玩弄贼喊捉贼的手法，企图把苏共领导集团破坏中苏两国人民友谊的责任，推到高举反对帝国主义和现代修正主义旗帜、坚持反对叛卖列宁事业的中国共产党人身上。文章胡说什么目前中苏两国人民的友谊“被中国领导人的行动蒙上了阴影”。
    最近出版的一期苏联杂志《在国外》在一篇反华文章中，竟把作为当前世界反帝斗争中流砥柱的中国，说成是“投降于帝国主义”，“无视自己的国际主义义务”，“忘记了孙中山的遗训”，“对孙中山本人也挥起棍子。”这篇文章还枉费心机地把中国人民反对苏联现代修正主义的革命的正义斗争同过去中国军阀的反苏行为相提并论。
    苏联修正主义领导集团还通过其他各种“纪念”活动，盗用孙中山先生当年对列宁领导的苏联的友好表示，进行招摇撞骗，猖狂反华。十一日在莫斯科举行的一次所谓孙中山诞辰纪念会上，纪念委员会主席、诗人吉洪诺夫恬不知耻地把正勾结美帝国主义、出卖越南人民利益、力图在中国周围组成反华包围圈的苏共修正主义领导集团，说成是“坚持采取同中国人民友好、共同反帝的坚定方针”。
    苏联《消息报》、《新时代》杂志和其他中央报刊以及一些地方报刊，最近一个时期也以纪念孙中山诞辰为名，大搞反华闹剧。仅在十一日和十二日，莫斯科各报刊就发表了十六篇所谓纪念孙中山的文章，其中有六篇公开地攻击中国共产党或中国领导人，其他文章也以含沙射影的手法，发出一片反华叫嚷。
