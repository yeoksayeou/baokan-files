The Vietnam People's Daily on November 17th published an editorial on the fourth month anniversary of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, urging the entire military and civilian population to bravely engage in new battles, strive for greater victories, and smash the U.S. imperialists' second "dry season offensive" plan.

The editorial pointed out that over the past four months, the military and civilians of North Vietnam have responded to Chairman Ho's call, fighting with a new surge of momentum. They have achieved brilliant victories, including shooting down 350 U.S. planes, sinking and destroying multiple U.S. patrol boats and warships, and annihilating or capturing large numbers of American invaders. This demonstrates that the more the American aggressors "escalate," the more miserable their failures become. The Vietnamese people fight stronger and win more with each battle.

The editorial noted that despite suffering heavy defeats, U.S. imperialism remains extremely obstinate and refuses to abandon its aggressive ambitions. It is preparing for a new "escalation," rapidly dispatching more expeditionary forces and mercenaries to South Vietnam to launch a second "dry season offensive." At the same time, it is threatening to further intensify the bombing of North Vietnam.

The editorial stated that these are merely the desperate schemes of U.S. imperialism. Its new "dry season offensive" plan is nothing more than the desperate struggles of a cornered beast.

The editorial emphasized that all military and civilian personnel in Vietnam, in response to Chairman Ho's call, are determined to forge ahead bravely, fear no sacrifices, and thoroughly smash the U.S. aggressors' second "dry season offensive" plan. They are resolved to defeat the American aggressors.

    越南《人民报》号召全国军民不怕牺牲奋勇前进
    彻底粉碎美帝第二次“旱季反攻”
    新华社河内十七日电  越南《人民报》十七日就《胡志明主席号召书》发表四个月发表社论，号召全国军民英勇进行新的战斗，争取更大的胜利，粉碎美帝国主义的第二次“旱季反攻计划”。
    社论指出，在过去四个月中，越南北方军民响应胡主席的号召，以新的磅礴气势进行了战斗，取得了共击落美机三百五十架、击沉和击毁美国别动艇和军舰多艘、歼灭和活捉了大批美国飞贼的辉煌胜利。这表明，美国强盗越是“升级”，失败得就越惨。越南人民越战越强，越战越胜。
    社论指出，美帝国主义遭到了惨重失败，但它还是极其顽固，不肯放弃它的侵略野心。它正在为新的“升级”作准备，加紧往南越增派远征军和帮凶军，以便发动第二次“旱季反攻”。同时，它正在叫嚷要进一步加强轰炸越南北方。
    社论说，这只不过是美帝国主义绝望的阴谋。它的新的“旱季反攻计划”也只不过是一头绝望的野兽进行的垂死挣扎而已。
    社论指出，越南全体军民响应胡主席的号召，决心披荆斩棘、奋勇前进，不怕牺牲，彻底粉碎美国侵略者的第二次“旱季反攻计划”，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。
