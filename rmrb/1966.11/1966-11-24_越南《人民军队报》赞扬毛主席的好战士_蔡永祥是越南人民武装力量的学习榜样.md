The Vietnamese newspapers *People's Army Daily* and *Vanguard* both published articles on November 23, enthusiastically praising the heroic deed of Cai Yongxiang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao and a good son of the Chinese people, who sacrificed his life to save a train carrying Red Guards.

The *People's Army Daily* article noted that Cai Yongxiang's selfless act of sacrificing his life to protect the people's property and lives is not only a model for the Chinese People's Liberation Army but also for the Vietnamese armed forces.

The article stated, "By learning from Cai Yongxiang, as well as from Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, and Liu Yingjun, we are learning the fine qualities of the revolutionary army, further establishing the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people and revolutionary heroism, in order to complete all tasks assigned by the Party."

The article continued, "Learning from these shining examples makes us more clearly understand the fine qualities of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, thereby further strengthening the combat unity between the two countries' armies and peoples, and enhancing our resolve to defeat the American aggressors."

The *Vanguard* also published an article on November 23 titled "Devoting Youth to the People," detailing Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds.
