	Food can be skipped, sleep can be forgone, but Chairman Mao's book must never be left behind for a moment! Red Guards and revolutionary students from Shanghai, just off the train and without rest, came to Tiananmen Square to study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

	Several ethnic minority Red Guards bought the long-awaited "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," their hearts filled with immense excitement. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your book is the lifeline of all revolutionary peoples of all ethnicities. Great Mao Zedong Thought guides our forward march. We will read your book for a lifetime and follow you in revolution for a lifetime!

	Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country actively responded to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, embarking on revolutionary tours. They are determined, through these tours, to familiarize themselves with society, with the masses, and with class struggle, to temper themselves in the storms and grow. This is a scene of them visiting and studying at Peking University.

	Red Guards and revolutionary students who came to Beijing for tours visited the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture exhibition. They vowed never to forget class bitterness, to remember blood debts, to never forget class struggle, to never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to be reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

	This most meaningful photograph was taken to forever remember the happy moments by Chairman Mao's side. Dear Leader Chairman Mao, we will turn your affectionate care into boundless strength. We resolutely follow your words: to care about state affairs, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	To make revolution, one must dare to take the hard road, to temper oneself into a tough revolutionary of the proletariat! Several Red Guards from Hubei decided to walk back from Beijing on foot. Before setting off, they came to Tiananmen Square, making a solemn vow before Chairman Mao's portrait: Please rest assured, Chairman Mao, we Red Guards are not afraid of the difficulties of the long march! We will definitely follow the direction you point out and march forward bravely on the ten-thousand-li journey to communism!

    在毛主席身边的日子里
    外地红卫兵和革命师生在北京
    饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席的书啊，一刻也不能离！来自上海的红卫兵和革命学生，刚下火车，还没休息，就来到天安门广场，学起了《毛主席语录》。
    几个少数民族红卫兵买到了日夜盼望的《毛泽东选集》，心里万分激动。毛主席啊，毛主席！您的书是各族革命人民的命根子，伟大的毛泽东思想为我们指引着前进的方向。我们要读一辈子您的书，跟着您干一辈子革命！
    全国各地的红卫兵和革命师生，积极响应党中央、毛主席的伟大号召，进行革命大串连。他们决心通过革命串连，熟悉社会，熟悉群众，熟悉阶级斗争，在大风大浪中锻炼成长。这是他们在北京大学参观、学习的情景。
    来北京串连的红卫兵和革命师生，参观了《收租院》泥塑展览。他们决心不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，誓做可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    拍下这张最有意义的照片，永远记住在毛主席身边的幸福时刻。敬爱的领袖毛主席，我们要把您对我们的亲切关怀化作无穷的力量。我们坚决听您的话：要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！　（本版照片是本报记者摄）
    干革命，就要敢于走艰苦的道路，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命的硬骨头！来自湖北的几个红卫兵决心从北京徒步走回去。出发前，他们来到天安门前，在毛主席像下庄严宣誓：请毛主席放心，我们红卫兵不怕远征难！我们一定沿着您指引的方向，在共产主义的万里征途上奋勇前进！
