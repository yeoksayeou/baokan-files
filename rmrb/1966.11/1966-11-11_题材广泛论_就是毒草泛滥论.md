The issue of themes is the issue of what to write about. This is a very important question. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers should enthusiastically sing the praises of the great Mao Zedong Thought and strive to portray the heroes of the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the most significant theme of our era.

However, Zhou Yang says, "What to write about is a secondary issue." He fervently advocates the so-called "Broad Themes Theory," opposing writers and artists from singing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and socialism. He loudly proclaims that writers and artists should have "full freedom" in choosing themes, advocating for the extensive writing of "bourgeoisie," "emperors, generals, and officials," "scenes of nature," and "personal affairs" and so on. Once Zhou Yang's black "imperial edict" is issued, monsters and demons stir everywhere. They brandish their counter-revolutionary pens, open their revisionist megaphones, write reactionary literature, sing reactionary songs, and perform reactionary plays. Foreigners, ancient people, dead people, and ghosts all take to the stage. It turns out that Zhou Yang's "Broad Themes Theory" is the theory of poisonous weeds spreading. It is Zhou Yang's "mobilization order" to the monsters and demons, and it is also the "smokescreen" that Zhou Yang raises against the Party and the people. Using this slogan, Zhou Yang gathers monsters and demons to hold a fair on our socialist cultural front, allowing all kinds of ghosts to "broadly" spread poison.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The bourgeoisie, regardless of the artistic achievements of the proletarian literary and artistic works, will always reject them." Zhou Yang's extensive promotion of the "Broad Themes Theory" is precisely an attempt to use bourgeois and revisionist poisonous weeds to gradually squeeze out the proletarian fragrant flowers, achieving the bourgeois "one flower blooming, one voice singing"; it is to gradually erode the proletarian literary and artistic front, corrupt the masses, mislead people's hearts, and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

To advocate the "Broad Themes Theory," Zhou Yang also concocted a set of theories and raised a "red flag." He says that the broad masses' needs for literature and art are diverse, so writers and artists should choose themes based on "people's different needs, interests, and preferences." This is honeyed words with a dagger hidden inside! The needs of our workers, peasants, and soldiers are diverse. However, our needs have a clear political standard. We need Mao Zedong Thought, not bourgeois thought; we need the new socialist life, not the decayed feudal and bourgeois life; we need heroes like Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun, not the ghosts and spirits like Hai Rui, Li Huiniang, and Li Xiangjun. In a word, we need the fragrant flowers of the proletariat, not the poisonous weeds of the bourgeoisie. The themes advocated by the Zhou Yang clique have nothing in common with the themes needed by our workers, peasants, and soldiers. They can only cater to the "interests" and "needs" of the bourgeois and revisionist elements.

    “题材广泛论”就是毒草泛滥论
    文书　姚永亮
    题材问题，就是写什么的问题。这是一个极重要的问题。革命的文艺家，应当热情歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，努力表现用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄，这是我们时代最重大的题材。
    可是周扬却说“写什么，是次要问题”。他狂热地鼓吹所谓“题材广泛论”，反对作家艺术家歌颂毛泽东思想，歌颂工农兵，歌颂社会主义；他大叫大嚷作家艺术家要有选择题材的“充分自由”，鼓吹大写“资产阶级”、“帝王将相”，大写“风花雪月”、“儿女私情”等等。周扬的黑“圣旨”一下，牛鬼蛇神四处蠢动，他们摇动反革命的黑笔杆子，张开修正主义的破喇叭，大写反动文，大唱反动歌，大演反动戏，洋人、古人、死人、鬼怪纷纷粉墨登场。原来，周扬的“题材广泛论”就是毒草泛滥论。它是周扬向牛鬼蛇神发出的“动员令”，又是周扬向党向人民打出的一杆“障眼旗”。利用这个口号，周扬纠集牛鬼蛇神，在我们社会主义文化阵地上开庙会，让各路鬼魅“广泛”放毒。
    毛主席教导我们，“资产阶级对于无产阶级的文学艺术作品，不管其艺术成就怎样高，总是排斥的。”周扬大肆鼓吹“题材广泛论”，正是企图用资产阶级、修正主义的毒草，来一点一点地挤掉无产阶级的香花，实现资产阶级的“一花独放、一家独鸣”；正是为了逐步蚕食无产阶级的文艺阵地，腐蚀群众，蛊惑人心，为资本主义复辟准备舆论。
    周扬为了鼓吹“题材广泛论”，还胡诌了一套理论，打了一杆“红旗”。他说什么“广大人民对于文学艺术的需要是多种多样的”，因此，作家艺术家要根据“人们的需要、兴趣和爱好不同”“选择题材”。这完全是蜂蜜口儿刀子心！我们工农兵的需要是多种多样的。但是，我们的需要是有鲜明的政治标准的。我们需要的是毛泽东思想，决不是资产阶级思想；我们需要的是社会主义新生活，决不是腐朽的封建阶级和资产阶级生活；我们需要的是雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊这样的英雄形象，决不是海瑞、李慧娘、李香君这些幽灵厉鬼。一句话，我们需要的是无产阶级的香花，决不是资产阶级的毒草。周扬一伙鼓吹的那些“题材”，同我们工农兵需要的题材毫无共同之处，它只能迎合那些资产阶级、修正主义分子的“兴趣”和“需要”。
