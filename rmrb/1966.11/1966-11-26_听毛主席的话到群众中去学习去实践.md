How should various levels of leadership push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage?

Listen to Chairman Mao's words and go to the masses to study and practice.

The representatives' meeting of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Kunming Military Region emphasized: We must mobilize the masses, learn from the masses, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses into systematic leadership opinions; we must cultivate models and promote the movement; we must lead in studying and be pioneers in revolutionizing the soul.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 25th: How can the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works be pushed to a new stage? The recent meeting of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the People's Liberation Army Kunming Military Region discussed this issue. After repeatedly studying Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, all the representatives unanimously agreed that the key lies in strengthening leadership. Various levels of party organizations must further grasp this and be more specific in implementation.

They said: Leadership work has countless aspects, but studying Chairman Mao's works is the first priority; among countless tasks, promoting ideological revolutionization is the top priority. This is the fundamental responsibility of various levels of leadership. Grasping this point means grasping the fundamental, core, and soul of building the army. If this point is grasped well, all work will be driven forward and all work will be done well. If this point is not grasped, it is the greatest dereliction of duty, which will inevitably lead to losing direction and leading the troops astray.

How can various levels of party organizations truly strengthen leadership and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage?

After thorough discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed that the fundamental issue is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to come from the masses and go to the masses, and to implement the mass line. Various levels of leading cadres must go deep into the masses and deep into the movement, leading the mass movement within the mass movement. They must not lock themselves in the office, issuing orders based on old experiences and old frameworks. They said: Detachment from the masses and detachment from reality means not being able to understand the situation, grasp the key points, and effectively solve problems; it means not being able to correctly lead the movement, and it may even become an obstacle to the movement, making the movement cold and lifeless. These are two fundamentally opposed attitudes and methods towards the mass movement and leading the mass movement. Implementing the mass line requires trusting the masses, relying on the masses, respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, treating the masses as teachers, seeking guidance from the masses, and being students of the masses. Only by first being students can one later become teachers; only by learning from the masses can one lead the masses. Leading cadres going deep into the masses means mobilizing the masses, unleashing the masses' creativity and wisdom, and then concentrating the masses' creativity and wisdom into systematic leadership opinions to guide the movement. This requires studying and practicing together with the masses, summarizing bit by bit experiences; it requires personally researching the masses' ideological trends and learning situations, personally researching and analyzing a few political classes, a few "Daily Readings," a few lectures, a few small rectification campaigns, and gaining direct experiences; it requires analyzing and organizing materials collected from various aspects, discovering problems from them, and solving them effectively. It requires continuously analyzing the development of the movement, grasping the key to the movement's development, mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and guiding the movement to continuously move forward.

The representatives also said: Leading cadres going deep into the masses must also pay attention to discovering and cultivating models and promoting advanced experiences. Models are the most realistic, the most vivid, the most persuasive, and the most inspiring, and they are the best living teachers. The emergence of one model can inspire a group of people and quickly raise the general level to an advanced level. One must be good at using models to promote the movement and make the movement lively and vibrant.

Those who educate others must first be educated. Those who lead the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works must first study and apply them well, take the lead in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and take the lead in revolutionizing the soul. The representatives used many vivid examples to illustrate that if leading cadres do not strive to study, they cannot lead the troops to truly master Mao Zedong Thought and will fall behind the masses. Falling behind in studying Chairman Mao's works is the greatest political backwardness and the greatest confusion. Some leading cadres in the representatives believe that if there is a phenomenon of leaders falling behind the masses, it must be quickly changed. If it is not changed, one not only lacks the qualifications to be a leader but also cannot maintain one's revolutionary integrity.

They said that leading cadres must lead in studying and set an example, strictly demanding of themselves according to the five conditions for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause proposed by Chairman Mao. This means believing in Chairman Mao, believing in the masses, correctly treating oneself, and being self-critical. To achieve these points, one must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the "full" mentality, like the members of a certain regiment's party committee, persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, consciously transforming oneself, consciously practicing, and consciously accepting the masses' criticism and supervision; like the political commissar of a certain regiment, Li Guiming, and the director of a certain hospital, Lu Kaifu, repeatedly studying the "Three Articles," working hard on transforming one's worldview, ensuring that one's position changes but the thought of serving the people does not, the environment changes but the frugal style does not, age changes but the vigorous spirit does not, and always living among the masses as an ordinary soldier, an ordinary party member, and an ordinary laborer.

In the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, which is advancing to a new stage, what should various levels of party organizations and leading cadres focus on? The representatives unanimously pointed out: The most fundamental thing is to use the "Three Articles" as teaching materials and weapons to break private interests and establish public interests, and to work hard on transforming one's worldview. They said: Breaking private interests and establishing public interests, thoroughly transforming one's worldview, is a major issue that determines whether one can be revolutionary to the end, and it is a major issue for establishing proletarian rule and ensuring that our party, state, and army will never change. Whoever does not strengthen the transformation of one's worldview, clings to individualism, and allows private ownership ideas to occupy one's mind will definitely not pass the socialist test, definitely will not be revolutionary to the end, and definitely will be eliminated.

How to study the "Three Articles" and transform one's worldview? Many representatives used their personal experiences to explain that one must develop a fighting spirit, treating ideological enemies like armed enemies, exposing, fighting, and changing them thoroughly. They believe that the struggle between the two worldviews is constantly and massively reflected in one's attitude towards everything. How to treat fame, status, future, honor, difficulties, work, study, life, family, comrade relationships, life and death, achievements and shortcomings, praise and criticism, as well as the situation and tasks, the party's policies, etc., all involve the struggle between the two worldviews of public versus private, for the people versus for oneself, for seven hundred million, three billion people versus for oneself. This struggle is constantly taking place in everyone's mind every day and every moment. Everyone must consciously grasp it, continuously expand the "public" character, establish the "public" character; break the "private" character, eliminate the "private" character. Each person must grasp their own active thoughts, creating a mass, sustained, and in-depth ideological revolutionary movement.

In recent years, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Kunming Military Region has surged higher and higher, with advanced units and individuals emerging like spring bamboo shoots after rain. The more than five hundred representatives attending this meeting are a part of them. After learning from each other and fully exchanging experiences, they confidently expressed that in the current domestic and international situation of great prosperity, they will definitely unite and lead the broad masses to climb the peak of Mao Zedong Thought, making Comrade Lin Biao's instructions truly implemented and realized, studying with new achievements, applying with new standards, and advancing and forever advancing on a more proletarian and more combat-ready path!

Attending the meeting of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Kunming Military Region, a platoon leader from a certain unit, Cui Hanwei, discussed Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage with his comrades, determining to study the "Three Articles" as a motto, thoroughly transforming his worldview.

    各级领导怎样把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段？
    听毛主席的话到群众中去学习去实践
    昆明部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议强调：要放手发动群众，向群众学习，把群众的智慧集中起来，化为系统的领导意见；要培养典型，推动运动；要学在前头，带头在灵魂深处闹革命。
    新华社昆明二十五日电　怎样才能把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段？人民解放军昆明部队最近召开的学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议上，全体代表反复学习了林彪同志的指示以后，一致认为，关键在于加强领导，各级党组织一定要进一步抓紧，更讲求落实。
    他们说：领导工作有千条万条，抓学习毛主席著作是第一条；千忙万忙，搞好思想革命化是第一忙。这是各级领导的根本职责。抓住这一条，就抓住了建军的根本，建军的核心，建军的灵魂。这一条抓好了，一切工作都带动起来了，一切工作都能搞好。不抓这一条，就是最大的失职，必然会迷失方向，把部队引到邪路上去。
    各级党组织怎样才能切实加强领导，真正把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段？
    代表们经过充分讨论，一致认为，根本的问题是，按照毛主席的教导，从群众中来，到群众中去，实行群众路线。各级领导干部，必须深入到群众中去，深入到运动中去，在群众运动中领导群众运动。决不能把自己关在办公室里，凭老经验、老框框发号施令。他们说：脱离群众，脱离实际，就不能弄清情况，抓住要害，有效地解决问题；就不能正确地领导运动，甚至会成为运动的阻力，把运动搞得冷冷清清。这是对待群众运动，领导群众运动的两种根本对立的态度和方法。实行群众路线，必须信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，拜群众为师，向群众求教，当群众的小学生。只有先当学生，才能后当先生；只有向群众学习，才能领导群众。领导干部深入到群众中去，就要放手发动群众，发挥群众的创造和智慧，再把群众的创造和智慧集中起来，化为系统的领导意见，指导运动。这就要和群众一起学习，一起实践，一起总结点滴经验；就要亲自研究群众的思想动向和学习情况，亲自研究分析几堂政治课，几次“天天读”，几场讲用会，几次小整风，取得直接经验；就要把从各方面收集起来的材料，进行分析整理，从中发现问题，切实加以解决。要不断分析运动发展的形势，抓住运动发展的关键，发动群众，依靠群众，指导运动不断向前发展。
    代表们还说：领导干部深入到群众中去，还要重视发现、培养典型，推广先进经验。典型，最现实，最生动，最有说服力，最能触动人，是最好的活教员。出现一个典型就能带动一批人，就能把一般水平迅速提高到先进水平。要善于运用典型来推动运动，把运动搞得生气勃勃，热气腾腾。
    教育人的人要先受教育，领导活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的人，要首先学好、用好，带头破私立公，带头在灵魂深处闹革命。代表们用许多生动事实说明，领导干部不努力学习，就不能带领部队真正把毛泽东思想学到手，就要落在群众的后面。在学习毛主席著作上落后，是最大的政治落后，是最大的糊涂人。代表中的一些领导干部认为，如果有领导落后于群众的现象，必须迅速改变，如不改变，不但没有资格充当领导，连自己的革命晚节也不能保持。
    他们说，领导干部要学在前头，起模范带头作用，必须按照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，严格要求自己。这就是说，一定要相信毛主席，相信群众，正确对待自己，对自己一分为二。要做到这几条，就要坚决彻底地打掉“满”字，像某师党委成员那样，坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作，自觉改造，自觉实践，自觉接受群众的批评监督；像某团政委李贵明、某医院院长路开友那样，反复学习“老三篇”，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，作到职务变，为人民服务的思想不变；环境变，艰苦朴素的作风不变；年龄变，朝气勃勃的干劲不变，处处以普通一兵、普通党员、普通劳动者生活在群众之中。
    在向着新阶段阔步前进的活学活用毛主席著作群众运动中，各级党组织，各级领导干部着重抓什么？代表们一致指出：最根本的是以“老三篇”为教材、为武器，破私立公，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。他们说：破私立公，彻底改造世界观，是决定每个人能否革命到底的大问题，是建立无产阶级统治，保证我们党、国家和军队永远不变质的大问题。谁不加强世界观的改造，抱着个人主义不放，让私有观念占据自己的头脑，就一定会过不了社会主义关，就一定不能革命到底，就一定会被淘汰。
    怎样学习“老三篇”，改造世界观？许多代表用自己的亲身经验来说明，一定要发扬斗争精神，像对待拿枪的敌人那样对待思想上的敌人，狠揭，狠斗，狠改。他们认为，两种世界观的斗争，经常地大量地表现在对待一切事物的态度之中。怎样对待名利、地位、前途、荣誉、困难、工作、学习、生活、家庭、同志关系、生与死、成绩与缺点、表扬与批评以及形势任务、党的政策，等等，都有为公还是为私，为人民还是为自己，为七亿、三十亿人还是为自己“一口人”的两种世界观的斗争。这种斗争每日每时在每个人的头脑里进行着。人人都要自觉地抓紧，不断地扩大“公”字，树立“公”字；破掉“私”字，消灭“私”字。自己抓自己的活思想，造成一个群众性的持续深入的思想革命运动。
    最近几年，昆明部队活学活用毛主席著作群众运动一浪高过一浪，先进单位和先进人物像雨后春笋般的大量涌现。参加这次会议的五百多名代表是其中的一部分。他们在互相学习，充分交流经验以后，满怀信心地表示，在当前国内外一片大好形势下，一定要团结和带领广大群众攀登毛泽东思想的珠穆朗玛峰，使林彪同志的指示真正贯彻、落实，学出新的成效，用出新的水平，在更加无产阶级化、更加战斗化的道路上，阔步前进，永远前进！（附图片）
