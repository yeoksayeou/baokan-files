The Ceylonese Communist Party's Sinhala weekly "Worker's News" has, in its recent issues, serialized an article enthusiastically praising the Red Guards as "the vanguard of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution."

The article states: "The Red Guards have emerged in the Chinese cultural revolution, and it has not been long, but they have shaken the world. Their sharp spearhead of struggle has pierced through all obstacles. They are advancing. The Red Guards, like sweeping garbage, are sweeping away all the old customs and habits of the exploiting classes. The old parasites hiding in dark corners cannot escape the sharp eyes of the Red Guards. The cause the Red Guards are undertaking is praiseworthy. Those who see this will surely shout: 'Long live the Red Guards! Long live Chairman Mao, the commander of the Red Guards!' "

    新华社科伦坡二十日电　锡兰共产党的僧伽罗文周刊《劳工报》，在过去几期里，连载专文，热烈赞扬“红卫兵已经成为中国无产阶级文化大革命的先锋”。
    文章写道：红卫兵在中国文化大革命中涌现出来，为时还不很久，但是他们震动了全世界。“他们斗争的锐利锋芒，冲破一切障碍。他们在前进着。红卫兵像扫垃圾一样，扫荡着一切剥削阶级的旧风俗和旧习惯。藏在阴暗角落里的老寄生虫，都逃不过红卫兵锐利的眼睛。”“红卫兵进行的事业是值得赞扬的。凡是看到这些的人，一定会高呼：‘红卫兵万岁！红卫兵的统帅毛泽东主席万岁！’”
