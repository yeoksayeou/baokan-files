Since May 1953, he has been dedicated to the cause of Japanese-Chinese friendship, making significant contributions to promoting friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Japan and China. Especially when American imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, and Soviet modern revisionism, along with their various followers, intensified their collusion to disrupt Japanese-Chinese friendship and carried out anti-China conspiracies, he stood firmly on the side of justice and, together with the majority of leaders of the Japanese-Chinese friendship movement, held high the banner of Japanese-Chinese friendship. He engaged in unyielding struggles against this small group of reactionary forces and saboteurs.

	Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: The Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Disarmament, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and other people's organizations, as well as Guo Moruo, Honorary Chairman of the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association, and Chu Tunan, Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, sent telegrams today to the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters and the Matsumoto Jiichiro Funeral Committee to express their condolences for the passing of Matsumoto Jiichiro, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters. They also extended their sincere sympathies to Matsumoto's family.

	These telegrams of condolence praised Matsumoto Jiichiro as a good friend of the Chinese people. He made important contributions to opposing the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, American imperialism, and to maintaining and developing the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. The telegrams also specifically mentioned that when American imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, modern revisionism, and their various followers intensified their efforts to disrupt the Japanese-Chinese friendship movement, and a small group of anti-China elements carried out sabotage activities within the Japanese-Chinese Friendship Association, Matsumoto Jiichiro, despite being bedridden, upheld justice and severed ties with the small group of anti-China elements. He established the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters, thereby maintaining the glorious tradition of the Japanese-Chinese friendship movement.

	The telegrams of condolence sent by the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association and others, as well as Guo Moruo and others, also expressed their firm belief that true friends of Japanese-Chinese friendship and the broad masses of the Japanese people will inherit Matsumoto Jiichiro's will, closely unite with the Chinese people, overcome all obstacles, and advance the Japanese-Chinese friendship movement more victoriously. They will carry on the struggle against the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, American imperialism, to the end!
