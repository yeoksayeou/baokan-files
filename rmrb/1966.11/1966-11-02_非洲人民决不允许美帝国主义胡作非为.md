Some African heads of state and foreign ministers have strongly condemned the pirate-like actions of the reactionary regime in Ghana, which, under the instigation of American imperialism, kidnapped the Guinean delegation led by Foreign Minister Louis Lansana Beavogui.

Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, upon learning of the reactionary regime in Ghana's actions on October 30, immediately issued a statement saying that the Tanzanian government was shocked by the actions of the Ghanaian authorities. "This is not only an insult to Guinea but also an insult to the Organization of African Unity and the entire African continent." He pointed out that the actions of the Ghanaian authorities "violate internationally accepted diplomatic customs." He demanded that the Ghanaian authorities immediately release the Guinean delegation.

On the same day, the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry also issued a statement condemning the actions of the Ghanaian authorities.

Algerian Revolutionary Council Chairman Houari Boumedienne, in a telegram to Guinean President Sekou Toure, expressed that the Algerian people would, as always, stand on the side of the Guinean revolution and actively support the struggle of the Guinean people.

Meanwhile, Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika also issued a statement to the press condemning the actions of the Ghanaian authorities as violating all international customs. The statement said, "The kidnapping of the Guinean delegation is 'an anti-African action, and imperialism will only be pleased with this.' He pointed out that Ghana's actions are 'a very serious action that damages the cause of African unity.' Bouteflika also sent a telegram to the Organization of African Unity, demanding that necessary emergency measures be taken against Ghana's actions.

Other African countries' delegations that arrived in Ethiopia's capital to attend the ministerial council meeting of the Organization of African Unity also strongly condemned the pirate-like actions of the American imperialists in collusion with the reactionary regime in Ghana to kidnap the Guinean delegation.

Congolese (Brazzaville) Foreign Minister Jean-Baptiste Okawa, upon arrival, said that the actions of the Ghanaian authorities in kidnapping the Guinean delegation were "a blatant act of piracy supported by American imperialism and colonialist countries." He said, "Such acts of piracy are common in regions under the control of the Johnson administration, but when such things happen in Africa, we must not allow them to go unchecked."

Malian Foreign Minister Ousmane Ba, at the airport in Addis Ababa, told reporters that the illegal kidnapping of the Guinean delegation by Ghana was "a blatant violation of international law."
