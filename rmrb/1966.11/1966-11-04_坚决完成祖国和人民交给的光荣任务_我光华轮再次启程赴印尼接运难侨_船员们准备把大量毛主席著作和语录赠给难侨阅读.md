The Guanghua Ship Sets Sail Again to Indonesia to Bring Back Overseas Chinese in Distress

The crew is preparing to give a large number of Chairman Mao's works and quotations to the overseas Chinese in distress for reading.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhanjiang, the Guanghua Ship set sail from Zhanjiang Port on October 30th and headed to Indonesia to bring back the second batch of overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the country.

After successfully completing the task of bringing back the first batch of overseas Chinese in distress from Indonesia on October 10th, the Guanghua Ship docked in Zhanjiang Port awaiting orders.

During this period, all crew members enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and studied Chairman Mao's works more deeply.

They took the "Three Articles" as their motto, further promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. All crew members were greatly inspired by the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the success of China's missile and nuclear weapon tests, boosting their confidence. They all expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely complete the new mission.

After receiving the new order to bring back overseas Chinese, the crew of the Guanghua Ship prepared a large number of Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," which they will give to the overseas Chinese in distress who board the ship.

The cabins and resting areas on the ship have all been decorated with portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and revolutionary paintings that promote Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as the overseas Chinese in distress board the motherland's ship, they will immediately be bathed in the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

Before the Guanghua Ship set sail, it received numerous letters from Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and returned overseas Chinese from all over the country, expressing their praise and encouragement. The care of the people of the motherland greatly inspired all the crew members of the Guanghua Ship. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely complete the glorious mission assigned by the government and people of the motherland.
