Japanese Publication of Chairman Mao's Quotations Greeted with Enthusiasm
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party's "Labour News" Serializes "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "On the Rectification of Mistaken Ideas"

	New Delhi, November 20 (Xinhua) — Tokyo: To meet the needs of a wide readership in Japan, the Tokyo Chinese Bookstore has printed and published the Japanese edition of "Chairman Mao's Quotations." Starting from the 20th, it has been officially distributed in Japan and has been enthusiastically welcomed by Japanese friends.

	The Japanese edition of "Chairman Mao's Quotations" published by this bookstore has the same design as the one widely read by the masses in China, with a red plastic cover. The frontispiece features a photograph of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and an inscription by Lin Biao, Mao's closest comrade-in-arms: "Study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

	The Japanese edition of "Chairman Mao's Quotations" began distribution in Nagoya on the day the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition opened. On that day, more than 2,500 copies were sold within the exhibition alone. An official from the Tokyo Chinese Bookstore said: "For a book to sell so many copies in one place in a single day is unprecedented in Japan. This situation shows how much the Japanese people need Mao Zedong Thought. It once again proves the great global significance of Mao Zedong Thought."

	A reader from Nagoya bought ten copies, intending to give them as precious gifts to his friends. Holding up the ten red books, he couldn't help but shout, "Long live Mao Zedong!"

	A worker from Kyoto bought four copies at once, saying, "There are four of us in the family, one for each person." The worker also told a Chinese reporter: "From the fact that the Japanese people love Chairman Mao's works so much, one can see how great Chairman Mao is in the hearts of the Japanese people."

	Colombo, November 20 (Xinhua) — Chairman Mao's works "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "On the Rectification of Mistaken Ideas" have been translated into Sinhala in Ceylon. The Sinhala-language weekly "Labour News" of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party has serialized these two works in recent issues.

    日本发行《毛主席语录》受到极大欢迎
    锡共《劳工报》连载《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》
    新华社二十日讯　东京消息：为了满足日本广大读者的需要，由东京中华书店印刷出版的《毛主席语录》（日文版），从二十日起正式在日本发行，受到日本朋友的热烈欢迎。
    由这家书店出版的《毛主席语录》（日文版），同中国国内广大群众阅读的《毛主席语录》装潢一样，用红色塑料封皮，扉页印有中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的照片，还有毛主席的最亲密的战友林彪同志的题词：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”。
    《毛主席语录》（日文版）是在中国经济贸易展览会在名古屋开幕的第一天，由东京运到名古屋开始发行的。这一天，仅在展览会内就卖了两千五百多册。东京中华书店的一位负责人说：一种书在一个地方一天就卖出这么多，这在日本是从来没有过的。这种情况说明，日本人民是多么需要毛泽东思想。这又一次证明了毛泽东思想的伟大世界意义。
    一位名古屋的读者一个人就买了十册，他准备把它们做为最珍贵的礼品送给他的朋友。他举着这十册红色宝书情不自禁地欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
    一位从京都来的工人一次买了四册，他说：“我们全家四个人，每人一册。”这位工人还对中国记者说：从日本人民这样热爱毛主席著作这个事实，就可以知道，在日本人民的心里，毛主席是多么伟大。
    新华社科伦坡二十日电　毛主席著作《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》已经在锡兰译成僧伽罗文。锡兰共产党的僧伽罗文周刊《劳工报》，在过去几期上连续刊登了这两篇著作。
