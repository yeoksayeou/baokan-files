The Red Flag Flies Ahead

The young Red Guards, Deng Xian,
Fear not the distant journey's hardships,
Have made a revolutionary vow,
And travel far and wide to connect.

A backpack on the shoulder,
The red flag flies ahead,
Mountains and rivers make way,
Wind and rain cannot hinder.

The "Little Red Book" is carried,
Spread the word to all.
Courtyards are clean, water is full,
Busy everywhere, no time to rest.

Learn from the People's Liberation Army,
Uphold the spirit of "Three-Eights",
Temper the will,
Be a red youth.

Humbly seek advice,
Learn all experiences,
Remember the Party's teachings,
The policy is the compass.

Follow the Sixteen Points,
Dare to think and dare to act.
Smash the "Four Olds",
Establish new norms.

Miracles happen frequently,
Heroes are countless,
With red successors,
The people smile with joy.

The young Red Guards, Deng Xian,
Fear not the distant journey's hardships,
Have made a revolutionary vow,
And travel far and wide to connect.
