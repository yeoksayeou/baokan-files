The Chinese table tennis athletes participated in this games with revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Cultural Revolution.

On the morning of the 27th, when they defeated their final opponents to advance to the championship finals, they still seized the time to continue studying relevant quotations from Chairman Mao, further resolving ideological issues, overcoming technical difficulties, and conquering challenges posed by objective conditions.

    亚新会乒乓球、羽毛球团体赛圆满结束
    我国男女队双双荣获冠军
    据新华社金边二十八日电　第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会男、女乒乓球团体赛，经过两天紧张的比赛，于二十七日晚胜利结束。中国男女乒乓球队双双获得冠军。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的我国男女乒乓球健儿，昨晚同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国男女队争夺冠军时，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，和勇敢战斗，不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，打出了风格，打出了水平。最后分别以五比○和三比○取得胜利。
    二十七日晚在金边综合体育场体育宫进行的乒乓球男女团体赛冠军争夺战，是一场具有世界水平的比赛。在历时两小时精采的比赛中，六千多名观众不断发出暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。
    我国男女乒乓球队双双获得冠军，是他们活学活用毛主席著作的新胜利。我国乒乓球健儿们带着在文化大革命中焕发出的革命豪情参加这届运动会。到达金边以后，他们仍然天天不离毛主席的书，把毛主席语录贴在床头上，带到练习场上。二十七日上午，当他们分别战胜最后一个对手进入冠军决赛时，还抓紧时间继续学习有关毛主席语录，进一步解决思想上的问题，克服技术上的难关和客观条件带来的困难，因此在当晚的比赛中，打得勇猛顽强。
    比赛结束后，举行了发奖仪式。柬埔寨第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会组织委员会副主席埃萨罗亲王代表第一届亚新会组织委员会向优胜者发了奖章。当中国的五星红旗在雄壮的国歌声中升起的时候，全场观众又爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。
    获得这届乒乓球团体赛男子团体第三名的球队是越南队和柬埔寨队，获得女子团体第三名的球队是越南队和日本队。
    据新华社金边二十八日电　第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会男、女羽毛球团体赛，从二十六日开始比赛以来，经过三天的紧张战斗今天全部结束。我国男、女羽毛球队分别以五比○战胜了柬埔寨男、女羽毛球队，获得了男女团体冠军。柬埔寨男、女队名列第二。
    柬埔寨王国政府驻体育局代表埃萨罗亲王观看了今天的团体赛决赛，并且为优胜者发了奖。
    在这三天的团体赛中，我国羽毛球健儿们发挥了快、狠、准、多变的特点。他们表现出的凶猛扣杀结合灵活短吊和快速进攻结合多变的发球，一再博得了观众和运动员的热烈掌声。人们纷纷称赞中国运动员所表现出的独特风格。
    我国羽毛球运动是近几年才发展起来的一项体育运动项目。我国羽毛球队一九五七年开始参加国际性的比赛，但近年来，这项运动发展很快，一九六三年，我国男女羽毛球队一举战胜了前世界冠军队——印度尼西亚男女羽毛球队，以后又击败了世界亚军队——丹麦男女羽毛球队。
    在整个羽毛球团体比赛中，充满着团结友谊和互相学习的气氛。各国运动员在比赛场上相互鼓励，亲切交谈，互相交流经验。
