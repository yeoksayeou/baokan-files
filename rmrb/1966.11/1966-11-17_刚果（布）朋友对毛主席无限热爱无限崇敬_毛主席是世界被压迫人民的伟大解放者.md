Chairman Mao is the great liberator of the oppressed peoples of the world

According to Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, November 15th: "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest genius and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time," "Mao Zedong Thought is a beacon that not only guides the Chinese people but also the oppressed peoples of the entire world," "We feel fortunate and proud to live in the great era of Mao Zedong."

This is the expression of the deep love and respect that Congolese (Brazzaville) friends have for Chairman Mao while visiting the recently concluded exhibition of China's industrial and agricultural achievements in Brazzaville.

During the exhibition, visitors came in a steady stream. Once, a squad of Congolese (Brazzaville) militia from a camp dozens of miles away came to visit. The next day, they sent a representative to the exhibition to copy down Chairman Mao's quotations. The representative said, "Chairman Mao's quotations are very important and have great educational significance. Our soldiers sincerely hope to learn these quotations and apply them in practice."

Many visitors, with deep love for Chairman Mao, came from far away to request Mao badges and Chairman Mao's works. They often stood in front of Chairman Mao's photo and statue displayed in the exhibition, giving a thumbs up and shouting "Mao Zedong!" Some women held their children, pointing at Chairman Mao's portrait, and taught the children to say, "Mao Zedong." A young girl told a Chinese comrade that her mother wanted a portrait of Chairman Mao to hang at home so that everyone could see Chairman Mao every day.

A 56-year-old railway worker named Ding Hate carefully viewed each picture in the exhibition. Another day, he brought a piece of writing he had prepared at home to the exhibition and neatly copied it into the guestbook. He wrote: "Chairman Mao is not only the great liberator of the Chinese people but also the great liberator of the oppressed peoples of the world. The path he pointed out for the Chinese people is also the path that the Congolese people should follow. We must let the younger generation know our common sufferings and the history of our common struggle. Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Congolese (Brazzaville) people enthusiastically congratulate the Chinese people on their tremendous achievements in industry and agriculture, regarding these achievements as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Visitor Sam wrote in the guestbook: "The Chinese people have been liberated for only seventeen years, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they have made astonishing progress in all aspects. If a poor country wants to establish an independent national economy, it must learn from the example of China." A university student wrote: "When the people of a country are guided by correct thoughts, they can create miracles."

At the closing of the exhibition, many visitors asked the Chinese comrades to convey their best wishes to Chairman Mao. They said, "The friendship and unity between our two peoples have brought us true happiness. Please tell Chairman Mao that the Congolese people sincerely wish him eternal life!"

    刚果（布）朋友对毛主席无限热爱无限崇敬
    毛主席是世界被压迫人民的伟大解放者
    据新华社布拉柴维尔十五日电　“毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的天才和最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”，
  “毛泽东思想是明亮的灯塔，不仅指引着中国人民，而且指引着全世界被压迫人民”，“我们为生活在伟大的毛泽东时代而感到幸福和骄傲。”
    这是刚果（布）朋友参观最近在布拉柴维尔闭幕的中国工农业建设成就图片展览会时表达的对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情。
    在展览会展出期间，观众川流不息。有一次，一队刚果（布）民卫团的民兵从几十里外的营地赶来参观，第二天，他们还专门派了一名代表，再次来展览会抄写毛主席的语录。这位代表说：“毛主席语录非常重要，具有重大的教育意义。我们的战士们真诚地希望学习这些语录，并且在实践中运用。”
    许多观众怀着对毛主席无限的热爱，从很远的地方赶来索取毛主席像章和毛主席的著作。他们常常站在布置在展览会里的毛主席照片和毛主席塑像跟前，竖起大拇指欢呼“毛泽东！”有些妇女抱着孩子，指着毛主席像，教孩子说：“毛泽东”。一位姑娘对中国同志说，她的母亲想得到一张毛主席像，以便挂在家里，好让大家天天看到毛主席。
    一位五十六岁的名叫丁哈特的铁路工人仔细地观看了展览会陈列的每一张图片。另一天，他又带了在家里写好的一段话来到展览会，并把它端端正正地抄在留言簿上。他写道：“毛主席，他不仅是中国人民的伟大解放者，也是世界被压迫人民的伟大解放者。他向中国人民指出的道路，也是刚果人民应该走的道路。我们必须让年青一代了解我们共同的苦难和共同的斗争的历史。毛主席万岁！”
    刚果（布）人民热烈祝贺中国人民在工农业方面所取得的巨大成就，把这些成就看成是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。观众萨马在留言簿上写道：“中国人民解放仅仅十七年，在毛泽东思想的指引下，各方面都取得了惊人的进步。贫困的国家如果要建立独立的国民经济，就必须学习中国的榜样。”一个大学生写道：“一个国家的人民，当他们受到正确思想的指导时，他们就什么奇迹都能创造出来。”
    在展览会闭幕时，许多观众要求中国同志向毛主席转达最好的祝愿。他们说：“我们两国人民的友谊和团结给我们带来了真正的幸福，请告诉毛主席，我们刚果人民真诚地祝他万寿无疆！”
