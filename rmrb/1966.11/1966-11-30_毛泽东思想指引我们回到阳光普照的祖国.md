	Mao Zedong Thought guides us back to the motherland bathed in sunshine.
	The representative of 41 heroic overseas Chinese youth, Wu Zhao'an, reports to the motherland on their struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries. He said: It is Chairman Mao who saved us from the depths of suffering. With a socialist motherland as our strong backing and 700 million compatriots as our steadfast support, we have the happiness of today.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, November 29th, the representative of the 41 heroic overseas Chinese youth who returned victorious yesterday, Wu Zhao'an, reported at the welcoming ceremony held by the people of Guangdong Province and Zhanjiang City today on their struggle under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought against the Indonesian reactionaries and their heroic deeds. Wu Zhao'an's moving speech aroused wave after wave of enthusiastic applause at the meeting. His speech is as follows:

	I represent the 41 overseas Chinese youth who were illegally arrested by the Indonesian reactionaries to greet our compatriots in the motherland who have been constantly concerned about us. Under the guidance of the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought, with the support of 700 million compatriots in the motherland, the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese, and the people of Indonesia, through the repeated negotiations of the motherland's government with the Indonesian reactionary authorities, and through our firm struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries, we finally broke out of the dark prison and returned to the motherland bathed in sunshine. In the face of the enemy's torture, we did not shed a single tear, but when we boarded the ship sent by our compatriots in the motherland, when we stepped on the land of the motherland that we have dreamed of day and night, hot tears soaked our clothes. The motherland is our dear mother. In the difficult years of living under the fascist rule of Indonesia, we always looked up to the north—listening to the voice of our dear mother. Now, we have finally returned to the embrace of our dear mother. The excitement and joy in our hearts cannot be expressed in words. We deeply feel that it is Chairman Mao who has saved us from the depths of suffering. With a socialist motherland as our strong backing and 700 million compatriots as our steadfast support, we have the happiness of today.

	Now, Indonesia is a place where patriotism is a crime and treason is rewarded; false imprisonment is rampant and demons run wild. We, the overseas Chinese who have lived there for generations, have also become thorns in the eyes and flesh in the hearts of the Indonesian reactionaries. The reactionaries say that loving the motherland is a crime, that being friendly with the people of Indonesia is also a crime, and that supporting the people of Indonesia in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism is an even greater crime. They have exhausted their wits and used all kinds of tricks to try to put the vast number of overseas Chinese to death. In Aceh, we were persecuted to the point of being homeless and destroyed. After being collectively driven to Medan, we lived in a concentration camp-like "reception center," and even Indonesian soldiers had to admit that we were living an "unbearable" life. However, after committing heinous crimes, the reactionaries still tried to cover up their crimes and deceive world public opinion. They protected their masters—the imperialist reporters—who sneaked into the "reception center" six times to try to take and create some deceptive photos. These plots of provocation were all thwarted by the united struggle of all the refugees, one by one. However, they did not give up. On October 10th, the Indonesian reactionary soldiers personally went to the "reception center" of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, using the pretext of inspecting hygiene to try to complete the evil deeds that their masters had failed to accomplish. We exposed their tricks in time, causing their plots to fail again. After their plots were repeatedly thwarted, they became angry and arbitrarily arrested us 41 people. They thought that by doing so, they could intimidate all the refugees in the "reception center" and extinguish the blazing flames of struggle, so that they could manipulate us at will. However, the reactionaries always misjudge the situation. Their arrest of us turned into our demonstration against them. We walked onto the car calmly and said goodbye to the refugees in the "reception center," expressing our determination: We will fight to the end to uphold national dignity and defend the honor of the motherland. They also waved and shouted, "Victory will surely be ours!" We sang "The East Is Red" and recited "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" all the way. We were not going to prison, but with the confidence of victory, we were going to fight a new and serious battle.

	During the 40 days of illegal detention, the enemy used all kinds of despicable and shameful means on us, but they could not shake our determination to defend the dignity and honor of the motherland. In the struggle, we became stronger and stronger, while the enemy became weaker and weaker. In front of us, the Indonesian reactionaries appeared so small and powerless. This is because in our hearts, there is a red sun, the reddest red sun. The more difficult the struggle, the more we miss our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Whenever we think of him, we gain limitless confidence and strength. On the prison walls, we wrote with our own blood the shining red words "Long live Chairman Mao." Whenever we saw these words, it was as if Chairman Mao was by our side, listening to Chairman Mao's patient teachings. We memorized and recited Chairman Mao's quotations one by one, using them to guide us in our struggle against the enemy round after round. It is precisely because the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought guides us that we are clear-eyed, braver, and stronger, and can be invincible.

	Chairman Mao's teaching of "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" gave us boundless strength; Chairman Mao's teaching of "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" encouraged us to dare to despise the Indonesian reactionaries and dare to fight against them resolutely. When the enemy beat us with whips, gun butts, fists, helmets, and boots, falling on our heads and bodies, although we were injured all over, we thought of Chairman Mao, and of Chairman Mao saying: "People must die, but the meaning of death is different.... To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, to die for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather." The pain in our bodies disappeared, and we dared to stand up straight against the enemy's bayonets. We warned the enemy: Even if they use bayonets to cut open our chests and stomachs, what they will find is only hearts that are deeply loyal to the motherland and to Chairman Mao. To protest against the enemy's fascist atrocities, we also thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our comrades must see achievements and see the light in difficult times, and raise our courage." We firmly believed that as long as we dared to struggle, victory would surely be ours. Thus, we carried out a six-day hunger strike, finally forcing the enemy to dare not humiliate and torture us again. We also, according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "In strategy, we must despise the enemy, and in tactics, we must take the enemy seriously," made full preparations for the enemy's secret interrogations. As a result, in the enemy's interrogation room, the executioners became the defendants. Under our righteous and stern reproaches, they were speechless and panic-stricken, not getting a single thing to deceive themselves. The enemy also used some despicable tricks, trying to split our fighting collective and soften our fighting will. But, "We are all from the four seas and the five lakes, and for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together.... All revolutionaries must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." Chairman Mao's words often echoed in our ears, making us, in the most difficult situations, display a high degree of class love. Everyone regarded being able to do something for their comrades as the greatest happiness. In the hot prison, some comrades specially fanned the air and caught mosquitoes for others. In the face of the enemy's beatings, some comrades used their bodies to protect others. We took care of each other and encouraged each other, forming a strong fighting collective under the call of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The enemy's prison could only confine our bodies but could not confine our high fighting will and surging revolutionary enthusiasm. We turned the enemy's prison into a classroom for class struggle. We studied Mao Zedong Thought there and sang revolutionary songs. Our songs and slogans often broke through the narrow prison, shattering the livers of the Indonesian reactionaries and arousing the sympathy of the Indonesian people. We were like 41 sharp swords that pierced the sky, pointing straight at the enemy, making them tremble with fear and restless at night. This is how we, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, fought to the final victory. All this made us deeply realize that our victory in the struggle is the victory of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	In this sharp international class struggle, the Indonesian reactionaries suffered a complete defeat. They tasted the bitter fruit of lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet. We will not forget that there are still millions of overseas Chinese victims in Indonesia suffering in the depths of suffering, and that the majority of the working people in the world have not yet been liberated. We will follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution. Here, we pledge to the most beloved Party, the dearest compatriots in the motherland, and the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: We will definitely always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming true successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We dare to defy the US imperialists and the Indonesian reactionaries with our brows raised, and we are also willing to be the oxen of the working people. We pledge to be the obedient tools of the Party and the people, unconditionally obeying the needs of the motherland, the Party, and the people, and together with the people of the motherland, carrying out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, carrying out the socialist revolution and socialist construction to the end, and contributing everything we have to support the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world.

	Finally, let us together shout: Long live the great socialist motherland! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the great Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! Long live the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live, long live, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

    毛泽东思想指引我们回到阳光普照的祖国
    四十一名英雄华侨青少年的代表吴招安向祖国亲人报告他们同印尼反动派的斗争经过。他说：是毛主席把我们从水深火热中解救出来，有了社会主义祖国做我们有力的靠山，有了祖国七亿亲人做我们的坚强后盾，我们才有了幸福的今天。
    据新华社湛江二十九日电　昨天胜利回国的四十一名英雄的华侨青少年的代表吴招安，在今天广东省和湛江市各界人民举行的欢迎大会上，向祖国亲人汇报了他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同印尼反动派进行坚决斗争的经过和英雄事迹。吴招安的动人讲话，在大会上激起了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。他的讲话如下：
    我代表被印尼反动派无理逮捕的四十一个华侨青少年，向时刻悬念着我们的祖国亲人问好。在战无不胜的伟大毛泽东思想指引下，在祖国七亿亲人、广大爱国侨胞和印尼人民的支持下，经过祖国政府向印尼反动当局的反复交涉，经过我们和印尼反动派的坚决斗争，我们终于冲出了暗无天日的牢狱，回到了阳光普照的祖国。我们在敌人的严刑拷打面前，没有流过一滴泪，可是，当我们登上祖国亲人派来的接侨船的时候，当我们踏上日夜梦想着的祖国土地的时候，热泪却湿透了我们的衣裳。祖国就是我们的亲娘，在侨居法西斯统治下的印尼的苦难岁月里，我们时刻都在仰望北方——倾听亲娘的声音。现在，我们终于投入了亲娘的怀抱，激动兴奋的心情无法用语言来表达，我们深深感受到，是毛主席把我们从水深火热中解救出来，有了社会主义祖国做我们有力的靠山，有了祖国七亿亲人做我们的坚强后盾，我们才有了幸福的今天。
    现在的印度尼西亚，爱国有罪，卖国有赏；冤狱遍地，群魔乱舞，我们世代居住在印尼的华侨，同样成了印尼反动派的眼中钉、肉中刺。反动派说我们热爱祖国“有罪”，说我们和印尼人民友好相处也“有罪”，说我们支持印尼人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争更“有罪”。他们挖空了心思，使尽了毒计，一定要把广大华侨置于死地。我们在亚齐被他们迫害得流离失所，家破人亡之后，又被集体赶到棉兰，住在集中营式的“收容所”里，就连印尼军人，也不得不承认，我们是过着“难以忍受的”生活。但是，反动派在犯下了滔天罪行以后，还妄想一手遮住天下人耳目。他们保护着他们的主子——帝国主义的记者，六次溜进“收容所”，企图拍摄和制造一些欺骗世界舆论的照片。这些阴谋挑衅，由于全体难侨团结一致，坚决斗争，一一遭到了可耻的失败。然而他们并不死心，十月十日，印尼反动军人又亲自出马来到棉兰华侨中学“收容所”，以检查卫生为名，梦想完成他们的主子没能干成的罪恶勾当。我们又及时揭穿了他们的诡计，使他们的阴谋又一次破产。在他们的阴谋连遭挫败之后，他们就恼羞成怒，无理逮捕了我们四十一个人，他们以为这样一来就可以吓倒“收容所”的全体难侨，扑灭炽烈的斗争火焰，以便他们能够任意摆布我们。但是，反动派总是错误地估计形势的，他们对我们的逮捕变成了我们对他们的示威，我们从容不迫地走上车，并向“收容所”的难侨告别，向他们表示决心：我们要为坚持民族气节、维护祖国尊严，斗争到底。他们也向我们招手高呼：“胜利一定属于我们！”我们一路上高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，朗诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们不是去坐牢，而是抱着必胜的信心去进行一次新的严重的战斗。
    在被非法拘留的四十天里，敌人对我们软硬兼施，使尽了各种卑鄙无耻的手段，但丝毫也没能动摇我们捍卫祖国尊严和荣誉的决心。在斗争中，我们越斗越强，敌人越斗越弱。在我们面前，印尼反动派显得那样渺小无能。这是因为我们的心中有一颗最红最红的红太阳，斗争越艰巨，我们就越想念最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，一想到他老人家，就增添了无限的信心和力量。在牢狱的墙壁上，我们用自己的鲜血写下了红光闪闪的“毛主席万岁”五个大字，一看到这几个字，就仿佛见到毛主席来到我们的身边，听到毛主席对我们谆谆的教导。我们凭着记忆，一条一条地反复背诵毛主席语录，用来指导我们同敌人进行一个回合又一个回合的斗争。正是由于战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想指引着我们，我们才心明眼亮，更勇敢，更坚强，才能够无往而不胜。
    毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，给了我们无穷的力量；毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的教导，鼓励着我们敢于藐视印尼反动派，敢于同它进行坚决的斗争。在敌人对我们严刑拷打，皮鞭、枪托、拳头、钢盔、皮靴轮番落在我们的头上、身上的时候，我们虽然遍体鳞伤，但是想起了毛主席，想起了毛主席说的：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。……为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”我们肉体上的痛苦就消除净尽，我们就敢于挺胸直对敌人的刺刀。我们正告敌人：即使用刺刀剖开我们的胸腹，挖出来的，也只有一颗颗对祖国、对毛主席无比忠诚的心。为了抗议敌人的法西斯暴行，我们又想到了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”我们坚信，只要敢于斗争，胜利就一定是我们的，于是我们进行了为期六天的绝食斗争，终于迫使敌人不敢再对我们进行凌辱和拷打。我们还按照毛主席关于“在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人”的教导，对敌人的秘密审讯做了充分的准备，结果，在敌人的审讯室里，刽子手变成了被告。在我们大义凛然、义正辞严的痛斥之下，他们哑口无言，惊慌失措，没有捞到任何一点可以自欺欺人的东西。敌人还使出一些卑鄙的伎俩，妄图分化我们的战斗集体，软化我们的战斗意志。可是，“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”毛主席的这些铭言经常回响在我们的耳边，使我们无论在多么严重的困难情况下，都发扬了高度的阶级友爱精神，大家都以能够为同志们作一点事当作最大的幸福。在闷热的牢房里，有的同志专门为别人扇风，捉蚊子。在敌人的毒打面前，有的同志用自己的身体护卫他人。我们互相照顾，互相勉励，形成了一个在伟大的毛泽东思想感召下的坚强的战斗集体。敌人的牢狱只能关住我们的肉体，却禁闭不了我们高昂的战斗意志和奔腾的革命豪情。我们把敌人的牢狱变成了阶级斗争的课堂。我们在那里大学毛泽东思想，大唱革命歌曲。我们的歌声和口号声，常常冲破狭小的牢房，震碎了印尼反动派的肝胆，唤起了印尼人民的同情。我们就像四十一把“刺破青天锷未残”的利剑，直指敌人，使他们胆战心惊，日夜不安。我们就是这样按照毛主席的教导，把斗争坚持到了最后胜利。这一切，使我们深刻地体会到，我们斗争的胜利，就是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    在这场尖锐的国际阶级斗争中，印尼反动派遭到了彻底失败。他们尝到了搬起石头砸自己的脚的味道。我们不会忘记，还有千百万印尼受害侨胞仍然处在水深火热之中，世界上还有大部分劳动人民没有得到解放。我们要永远跟着毛主席革命到底。在这里，我们向最敬爱的党，最亲爱的祖国亲人，最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席保证：我们一定要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做一个真正的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们敢于横眉冷对美帝国主义和印尼反动派，我们也俯首甘为劳动人民的牛。我们保证做党和人民的驯服工具，无条件地服从祖国、党和人民的需要，和祖国人民一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设进行到底，为支援世界人民的革命斗争贡献自己的一切。
    最后，让我们一起高呼：伟大的社会主义祖国万岁！伟大的中国共产党万岁！伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
