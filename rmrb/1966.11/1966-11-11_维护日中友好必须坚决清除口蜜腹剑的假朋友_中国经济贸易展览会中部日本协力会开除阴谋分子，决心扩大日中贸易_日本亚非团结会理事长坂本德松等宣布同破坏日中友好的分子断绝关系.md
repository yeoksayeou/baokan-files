The China Economic and Trade Exhibition Central Japan Cooperation Association held an emergency meeting of its standing committee members in the afternoon of the 5th, exposing that a small group of people, represented by Standing Committee Member Oohashi Mitsuo, who publicly claimed to be promoting "Sino-Japanese friendship," were actually undermining Sino-Japanese friendship and the exhibition behind the scenes.

The Standing Committee decided to expel these two-faced false friends from the association.

At the meeting, the association's Secretary-General Fukuda Ryuro, representing the Secretariat, exposed Oohashi Mitsuo's series of destructive activities in Tokyo and Nagoya. He pointed out that Oohashi not only slandered the Chinese exhibition team and tried to drive a wedge between the exhibition team and the Japanese people, but also spread rumors saying, "The Chinese exhibition might be canceled in Nagoya," in an attempt to undermine the enthusiasm of the people of Central Japan for the exhibition. Deputy Secretary-General Ren Jianxin of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition Team was invited to speak at the meeting, representing the exhibition team to expose the criminal activities of the small group represented by Oohashi Mitsuo in opposing Sino-Japanese friendship and undermining the exhibition.

After discussion and deliberation by the president and vice-presidents, the meeting decided to remove Oohashi Mitsuo from his position as a standing committee member and ordered him to leave the meeting. The meeting also passed a resolution stating that the standing committee members would "strive to promote friendship between Central Japan and China and expand trade."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Japanese Asian-African Solidarity Committee Chairman Sakamoto Tokumatsu and more than ten standing committee members of this committee, after a fierce struggle with the elements opposed to Sino-Japanese friendship at the standing committee meeting held on the afternoon of the 3rd, left the meeting and announced the severance of relations with those destructive elements.

Those who opposed Sino-Japanese friendship at the meeting insisted on opposing the joint statement signed on October 9 in Beijing by the Japanese Asian-African Solidarity Committee delegation and the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee.

Among those who left the meeting with Sakamoto were: Secretary-General Itaya Shozo of the Japanese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, Standing Committee Members Kaji Shizuma, Takano Minoru, Sato Shigeo, Ikegami Katsunori, Tanaka Shujiro, Kase Tsukiko, and others.

In addition, those who did not attend the meeting that day but expressed support for Sakamoto's actions through proxy votes included: Representative Committee Members Nakajima Kenzo and Kuroda Jutaro of the Japanese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, Standing Committee Members Okada Haruo, Tanaka Toshio, Hozumi Shichiro, Tanaka Sumiko, Miyazaki Yoshimitsu, Shiraishi Ban, and Mitsushima Ichiro.

Sakamoto, at a press conference held that evening, cited facts to point out that the forces that create various excuses to obstruct the solidarity of the peoples of Asian and African countries and Sino-Japanese friendship, while talking about solidarity in words, actually undermine solidarity in actions, and while talking about friendship in words, actually obstruct friendship in actions, have been engaged in insidious destructive activities.
