Broad masses of rural commune members in Sichuan Province are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seizing the revolution, and promoting production. In a year of severe drought, they have achieved a large-scale and substantial increase in cotton production. Many communes and production teams across the province have reported yields of over 100 jin (50 kg) of lint cotton per mu (1/15 acre). Currently, commune members are enthusiastically selling new cotton to the state. By the beginning of November, the total amount of cotton received by the state has already exceeded the procurement plan, increasing by more than one-third compared to the same period last year. The quality of the cotton has also improved by one grade compared to last year.

This year, over four million mu of cotton in Sichuan Province have all been affected by natural disasters such as drought, pests, and heavy rain during their growth period. Broad masses of cadres and commune members have studied and applied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" in practice, engaging in a tenacious struggle against natural disasters and finally achieving a bumper harvest.

At present, commune members across the region are continuing to pick the late-season cotton, ensuring a bumper harvest and delivering more cotton to the state.

    大旱之年夺得大面积增产
    四川棉花入库量超过收购计划
    据新华社成都电　四川省农村广大社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，在大旱之年夺得了棉花大面积大幅度增产。全省出现了许多亩产百斤皮棉的社、队。目前，社员们正在踊跃地向国家出售新棉。到十一月上旬，全省棉花入库总量已超过国家收购计划，比去年同期增加三分之一以上，棉花质量也比去年提高一个等级。
    今年四川省四百多万亩棉花在生长过程中，都曾遭受到干旱、病虫、阴雨等自然灾害的袭击。广大干部、社员活学活用“老三篇”，同自然灾害展开了英勇顽强的斗争，终于夺得了好收成。
    现在，各地社员正继续收摘后期棉花，保证作到丰产丰收，向国家交售更多的棉花。
