Vice Premier Chen Yi today stated that the recent collusion between U.S. imperialism and the reactionary regime in Ghana to kidnap Guinea's Foreign Minister Louis Lansana Beavogui and the delegation he led is a serious provocation against the Guinean people and all African people. The just struggle of the Guinean people against U.S. imperialist provocations has won the sympathy and support of public opinion in Africa and around the world. The Guinean people's struggle has once again achieved victory. U.S. imperialism has once again exposed its arrogant and bullying nature, its ugly face of doing evil deeds. President Sekou Toure is right in saying, "U.S. imperialism is the people's sworn enemy."

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these remarks at a banquet he hosted this evening to welcome the economic delegation from the Republic of Guinea.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that there is a Chinese proverb: "A dog travels a thousand miles to eat dung, a wolf travels a thousand miles to eat people." Countless facts have proven that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will never change, and it is becoming more cunning and more despicable.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that President Sekou Toure's recent order to expel the U.S. "Peace Corps," ban Pan American World Airways from using Conakry Airport, and declare that Guinea does not need "U.S. aid" is completely correct. This reflects the revolutionary heroism of the Guinean people and the African people. The Guinean people are not to be trifled with, and the African people are not to be trifled with.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed firm support for the Guinean people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. He said that the Chinese people will stand firmly on the side of the Guinean people, and the Asian, African, and world peoples will stand on the side of the Guinean people. Let us unite and engage in a head-on struggle with U.S. imperialism until it is eliminated.

Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned the recent announcement by the reactionary regime in Ghana to sever diplomatic relations with China. He pointed out that this is part of the current anti-China tide stirred up by U.S. imperialism and international reactionary forces, and is another example of the Ghanaian reactionary regime following the lead of the United States.

He said that the Chinese people have deep friendship with the Ghanaian people, a friendship based on anti-imperialist revolution, which imperialism and its lackeys can never destroy. All anti-China elements will ultimately end up hurting themselves. The Ghanaian reactionaries who disrupt Sino-Ghanaian relations will certainly meet a bad end.

    陈毅副总理重申坚决支持几内亚人民反击美帝挑衅
    几内亚人民不可侮，非洲人民不可侮
    指出加纳反动当局中断中加两国关系是追随美帝反华的又一例证
    新华社十一日讯　陈毅副总理今天指出，美帝国主义最近勾结加纳反动当局绑架几内亚外交部长路易·朗萨纳·贝阿沃吉和由他率领的几内亚代表团，这是对几内亚人民和全体非洲人民的严重挑衅。几内亚举国上下反对美帝国主义挑衅的正义斗争，赢得了非洲和全世界公众舆论的同情和支持，几内亚人民的斗争又一次获得了胜利。美帝国主义又一次暴露了它的横行霸道、专干坏事的丑恶面目。杜尔总统说得对，“美帝国主义是人民的不共戴天的敌人”。
    陈毅副总理是在他今晚为欢迎几内亚共和国政府经济代表团而举行的宴会上说这番话的。
    陈毅副总理强调说，中国有句俗话：狗行千里吃粪，狼行千里吃人。无数的事实证明，美帝国主义的侵略本性是决不会改变的，而且越来越狡猾，越来越卑鄙。
    陈毅副总理说，最近杜尔总统下令驱逐美国“和平队”，禁止美国泛美航空公司使用科纳克里机场，并且宣布几内亚不需要“美援”，这是完全正确的，这体现了几内亚人民和非洲人民的革命英雄气概。几内亚人民不可侮，非洲人民不可侮。
    陈毅副总理代表中国政府和中国人民表示坚决支持几内亚人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争。他说，中国人民将坚定地站在几内亚人民一边，亚非人民、世界人民都站在几内亚人民一边。让我们团结起来，同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，直到把它消灭为止。
    陈毅副总理强烈谴责加纳反动当局最近悍然宣布中断中加两国关系。他指出，这是当前美帝国主义和国际反动势力掀起的反华逆流的一个组成部分，是加纳反动当局追随美国的又一例证。
    他说，中国人民同加纳人民之间有着深厚的友谊，这种友谊是反帝的革命友谊，是帝国主义及其走狗绝对破坏不了的。一切反华的人到头来只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。破坏中加关系的加纳反动派也一定是得不到好下场的。
