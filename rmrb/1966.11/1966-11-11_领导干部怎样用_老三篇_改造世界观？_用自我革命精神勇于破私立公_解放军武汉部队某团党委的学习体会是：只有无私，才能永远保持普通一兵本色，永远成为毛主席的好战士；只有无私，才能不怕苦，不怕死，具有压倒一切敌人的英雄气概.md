The Party Committee of a certain regiment in the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army believes that the key to thoroughly studying and applying the "Three Articles" is to have a strong spirit of self-revolution, using the "Three Articles" as a weapon to break private interests and establish public interests. They say: Only by being selfless can one always adhere to Chairman Mao's books as the guiding principles for all work; only by being selfless can one have foresight, not seek fame or personal gain, consider the big picture, understand the overall situation, have a broad vision for the country, and look at the world; only by being selfless can one have no prejudice, correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, uphold the truth, and correct mistakes; only by being selfless can one be fearless, endure hardships, and have the heroic spirit to overcome all enemies; only by being selfless can one always maintain the spirit of an ordinary soldier, get close to the masses, and connect with reality. In summary, only by being selfless can one become a good soldier of Chairman Mao, a noble person, a pure person, and a person beneficial to the people.

The Party Committee of this regiment's understanding of the great significance of studying the "Three Articles" was gradually clarified through repeated study, repeated practice, and repeated struggle. Two years ago, an incident occurred: During the evaluation of the "Four Good" regiments, the Third Regiment was the regiment's training vanguard, but the regiment's leadership had a single-minded military viewpoint and did not meet the "Four Good" standards. During the committee's discussion, many comrades were afraid that the Third Regiment would not be rated as a "Four Good" regiment, which would negatively affect the regiment, and thus rated it as such. As a result, the higher authorities did not approve it, and the masses also had opinions about the committee's actions.

This incident had a significant impact on the regiment's Party Committee. They studied and discussed Mao Zedong's teachings and the relevant instructions from the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, repeatedly learning and discussing, realizing that the fundamental reason why the regiment's Party Committee did not act according to standards was that they had personal motives, wanting to raise the evaluation of their unit and even their personal work, to appear glorious in front of superiors and the masses. This incident made everyone deeply feel that when doing a job or handling an issue, having personal motives is not acceptable. One must break private interests and establish public interests, and transform one's worldview. How to do it? They believed that the "Three Articles" are the foundation and the sharpest weapon, and must be repeatedly studied and applied. Over the past two years, they have continuously studied and practiced, achieving many successes. The Party Committee members have consciously taken the lead in revolutionizing themselves, the collective leadership is strong, the atmosphere of principles is high, the implementation of the Party's policies and principles is decisive, and the implementation of the five principles of emphasizing politics is relatively conscious. This has driven the troops' ideological revolutionization and enhanced the troops' combat effectiveness.

The Party Committee members of this regiment have the following experiences in studying the "Three Articles" and transforming their worldview:

First, one must dare to carry out self-revolution and fiercely attack the bourgeois worldview. They say: To attack the bourgeois worldview and break private interests and establish public interests, one must put "dare" first, not fear pain, not fear ugliness, and consciously reveal one's thoughts.

In the past, some members of this regiment's Party Committee were afraid that superiors would not trust them, peers would look down on them, and subordinates would not respect them, and thus did not dare to reveal their thoughts. With these problems in mind, they studied the "Three Articles" and Mao Zedong's discussions on criticism and self-criticism, realizing that not daring to reveal one's thoughts is due to the "private" self, ultimately a question of whether one wants to revolutionize. After raising their awareness, everyone checked themselves with high standards and consciously revealed their thoughts. Not only did they reveal what others knew, but also what others did not know; not only did they reveal their methods of thinking, but also their consciousness of thinking; not only did they reveal their thoughts in the Party Committee meetings, but also among the cadres and soldiers.

After revealing one's thoughts, one must dare to carry out criticism and struggle. Their slogan is: Close combat, proactive attack, dare to fight with wrong thoughts with bayonets. At the beginning, some comrades could reveal their wrong thoughts, but during criticism, they were somewhat evasive, especially when criticizing others, they described it lightly, fearing that if the words were too heavy, others would have objections. The Party Committee addressed this issue by using the method of small rectification to organize everyone to study the "Three Articles" and "Opposing Liberalism" again, prompting everyone to consciously carry out ideological struggles. Through study, everyone realized that to carry out self-revolution, one must actively attack the "enemy" in one's thoughts, engage in close combat, and dare to "fight with bayonets," thus eliminating it and making proletarian thoughts occupy the position.

Second, to break through and develop deeply, one must thoroughly revolutionize.

Some members of this regiment's Party Committee, after achieving some success in ideological transformation, had the idea of "getting by." In response to this thought, they repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," compared them with Mao Zedong's discussions on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and realized that they still had a long way to go and must diligently study and strive to transform. Everyone said: Towards the "enemy" in one's thoughts, one must also use the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly," proactively attack, pursue relentlessly, and thoroughly carry out the revolution. How to thoroughly carry out the revolution? They grasped three aspects in practice:

Repeatedly grasp major issues and do not relax because of some control. In recent years, in addition to paying constant attention to the various active thoughts in the Party Committee members' implementation of the Party's policies and principles, the regiment's Party Committee especially paid attention to those private thoughts that easily affect morale and work. They organized everyone to repeatedly study the "Three Articles," establish the thoughts and styles of diligence, hard work, modesty, prudence, and being a "yellow cow" for the people for life, making everyone take Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Mountain as examples, generally maintaining a vigorous revolutionary spirit.

Deeply excavate hidden problems and do not overlook them because they are just fleeting thoughts. The leaders of this regiment have undergone relatively long-term revolutionary tempering, received more education from the Party, and have a certain ability to recognize and criticize, which is a favorable aspect of ideological transformation. But precisely because of this, it is easy to overlook serious ideological struggles. Therefore, it is necessary to use the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" to fiercely excavate and struggle against the hidden thoughts in the depths of one's mind, even if they are just fleeting thoughts, and eliminate them in their budding state. Therefore, the Party Committee pays more attention to grasping the ideological trends of the Party Committee members, timely discovering problems, and thoroughly solving them.

Pay attention to minor issues and do not be careless because they are "minor." They say: The struggle to eliminate bourgeois thoughts and promote proletarian thoughts is specific, it is reflected in the implementation of the Party's policies and principles and major issues such as work and study, and also permeates many "minor" issues in the field of life. Towards "minor" issues, one must treat them seriously with the spirit of thorough revolution, always pay attention to correcting the major direction in minor issues. They believe that ideological transformation must have a high standard. If the standard is low, major issues will also be seen as minor; with a high standard, one can see the major in the minor, and better promote ideological revolutionization.

Third, to truly thoroughly revolutionize, one must continuously revolutionize.

Chairman Mao said: "The situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must learn." He also said: "The old process has ended, and a new process has begun. The new process contains new contradictions and begins its own history of contradiction development." In the struggle to transform their worldview, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, adhered to the viewpoint of two aspects, and regarded every progress made in transforming thoughts as a new foundation, new condition, and new motivation for further achieving ideological revolutionization. They said: Ideological transformation cannot be combined with rest, nor can it be done once and for all. One must strive for perfection, continuously learn, continuously discover problems, continuously struggle, and continuously advance. Their approach is:

See one's own problems from the leadership's requirements. The Party Committee attaches great importance to studying the latest instructions from the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Comrade Lin Biao, drawing strength from them, and continuously raising the self-awareness of transforming one's worldview.

See the gap from advanced examples and advanced experiences. This regiment's Party Committee, regardless of how busy the work is, seriously studies the advanced examples and advanced experiences that emerge nationwide and throughout the army, finds the gaps, and formulates measures to learn from and catch up with the advanced.

See the inadequacies from progress. A saying circulates among the Party Committee members: "Achievements do not run away if not mentioned, and shortcomings are not seen if not looked at." In continuous progress, seeing new inadequacies, one always maintains a clear mind.

See the leadership's shortcomings from the army's problems. They believe that the problem is in the army, and the root is in the leadership. When a problem occurs, only by starting from the leadership can the root of the problem be grasped.

In recent years, the Party Committee members of this regiment have increasingly clearly realized in the process of transforming their worldview: In front of the "Three Articles," regardless of age, seniority, or level, everyone is a beginner. Only by working hard on the words, combining them with the actual thoughts and work, repeatedly studying and applying them, can one hope to truly master them.

    领导干部怎样用“老三篇”改造世界观？
    用自我革命精神勇于破私立公
    解放军武汉部队某团党委的学习体会是：只有无私，才能永远保持普通一兵本色，永远成为毛主席的好战士；只有无私，才能不怕苦，不怕死，具有压倒一切敌人的英雄气概
    据新华社武汉十日电　领导干部怎样大学“老三篇”，大用“老三篇”，真正学懂、做到？出席人民解放军武汉部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的某团党委认为：关键在于要有强烈的自我革命精神，以“老三篇”为思想武器，破私立公，改造世界观。他们说：只有无私，才能把毛主席的书当作各项工作的指导方针；只有无私，才能有远见，不图名，不为利，顾大局，识大体，胸怀祖国，放眼世界；只有无私，才能无偏见，正确开展批评与自我批评，坚持真理，修正错误；只有无私，才能无畏，不怕苦，不怕死，具有压倒一切敌人的英雄气概；只有无私，才能永远保持普通一兵的本色，深入群众，联系实际。总之，只有无私，才能成为毛主席的好战士，成为高尚的人，纯粹的人，有益于人民的人。
    这个团党委对于学习“老三篇”重大意义的认识，是经过反复学习，反复实践，反复斗争，才逐步明确起来的。两年前曾发生过这样一件事：在总评四好连队时，三连是团的训练先行连，但是，连的领导有单纯军事观点，不够四好标准。团党委讨论时，不少同志怕三连评不上四好连队，对团里影响不好，把它评上了。结果上级没批准，群众对党委的作法也有意见。
    这件事对团党委震动很大。他们对照毛主席的教导和军委、林彪同志的有关指示，反复学习讨论，认识到团党委没有按标准办事，根本原因是有私心，想把本单位以至个人的工作估价高些，在上级和群众面前光彩。这件事，使每个人都深深感到做一项工作，处理一件事情，有私心就不行，必须破私立公，改造世界观。怎么办？他们认为，“老三篇”是基础课，是最锐利的武器，必须反复学，反复用。两年来，他们不断学习，不断实践，取得了不少成绩。党委成员能自觉地带头革命化，集体领导强，原则空气高，贯彻党的方针政策坚决，贯彻突出政治五项原则比较自觉。从而，带动了部队思想革命化，提高了部队战斗力。
    这个团党委成员学习“老三篇”，改造世界观的体会是：
    首先要敢于自我革命，敢于向资产阶级世界观猛烈开火。他们说：要向资产阶级世界观开火，破私立公，就要“敢”字当头，不怕痛，不怕丑，自觉地亮思想。
    过去，这个团党委的部分成员，怕上级不信任，同级瞧不起，下级不尊重，不大敢亮思想。他们带着这些问题，学习了“老三篇”和毛主席关于批评与自我批评的论述，认识到不敢亮思想是“私”字作怪，归根结底是个想不想革命的问题。提高了认识，大家以高标准检查自己，自觉地亮思想。不但亮别人知道的，而且亮别人不知道的；不但亮思想方法，而且亮思想意识；不但在党委会上亮，而且在干部战士中亮。
    亮出了思想还要敢于开展批评，进行斗争。他们的口号是：短兵相接，主动进攻，敢于同错误思想拚刺刀。开始，有的同志能亮出错误思想，但批判时有些躲躲闪闪，特别是批评别人，轻描淡写，怕话重了别人有意见。党委针对这个问题，采用小整风的方法组织大家再次学习“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》，促使大家自觉地开展思想斗争。通过学习，大家认识到，要自我革命，必须积极地向思想上的“敌人”进攻，和它短兵相接，勇于“拚刺刀”，这样才能消灭它，使无产阶级思想占领阵地。
    第二、冲开突破口，必须向纵深发展，彻底革命。
    这个团党委部分成员，在思想改造上取得一些成绩以后，产生了过得去的想法。针对这种思想，他们又反复学习“老三篇”，对照毛主席关于“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的论述，认识到自己还差得很远，还必须勤奋地学习，努力改造。大家说：对思想上的“敌人”，也要用“完全”、“彻底”的精神，主动进攻，穷追猛打，彻底闹革命。怎样彻底闹革命？他们在实践中抓了三个方面：
    反复地抓大问题，不因有所克服而放松。近年来，团党委除经常注意抓党委成员贯彻执行党的方针、政策中的各种活思想以外，特别注意抓那些容易影响斗志、影响工作的私心杂念。组织大家反复学习“老三篇”，树立勤勤恳恳，艰苦奋斗，谦虚谨慎，为人民当一辈子“老黄牛”的思想和作风，使大家以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，普遍保持旺盛的革命斗志。
    深挖隐蔽的问题，不因为是一时闪过的杂念而忽视。这个团的领导干部都经过较长期的革命锻炼，受党的教育较多，有一定的认识批判能力，这是思想改造有利的方面。但正因为这样，也容易忽视严肃的思想斗争。这就必须以“完全”、“彻底”的精神，狠挖狠斗隐蔽在思想深处的、即使是一时闪过的杂念，把它在萌芽状态时就消灭。因此，党委比较重视掌握党委成员的思想动向，及时发现问题，彻底解决。
    注意小问题，不因“小”而马虎。他们说：灭资兴无的思想斗争是具体的，它表现在执行党的方针政策和工作、学习等重大问题上，也渗透在生活领域的许多“小问题”之中。对于“小问题”，必须以彻底革命的精神严肃看待，时时注意在小问题上端正大方向。他们认为，思想改造一定要有个高标准。如果是低标准，大问题也会看小；有了高标准，就能小中有大，更好地促进思想革命化。
    第三、要真正彻底革命，还必须不断革命。
    毛主席说：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”又说：“旧过程完结了，新过程发生了。新过程又包含着新矛盾，开始它自己的矛盾发展史。”他们在改造世界观的斗争中遵循毛主席的教导，坚持一分为二的观点，把改造思想所取得的每一个进步，都作为进一步实现思想革命化的新基础，新条件，新动力。他们说：思想改造不能劳逸结合，也不能一劳永逸，必须以精益求精的精神，不断地学习，不断地发现问题，不断地进行斗争，不断地前进。他们的作法是：
    从领导的要求中看到自己的问题。党委十分重视学习党中央、毛主席和林彪同志的最新指示，从中吸取力量，不断提高改造世界观的自觉性。
    从先进典型和先进经验中看到差距。这个团党委对于全国全军不断出现的先进典型和先进经验，不论工作怎么忙都要认真学习，找出差距，订出学习和追赶先进的措施。
    从进步中看到不足。党委成员中流行着这样一句话：“成绩不说跑不了，缺点不看不得了。”在不断进步中看到新的不足，就经常保持着清醒的头脑。
    从部队的问题中看到领导的缺陷。他们认为，问题在部队，根子在领导。发生了问题只有从领导抓起，才算抓住了问题的根子。
    几年来，这个团党委成员在改造世界观的过程中，越来越清楚地认识到：在“老三篇”面前，不论年龄大小，资历长短，水平高低，人人都是小学生。只有在用字上狠下功夫，结合思想和工作实际，反复学，反复用，才有希望真正学到手，真正掌握起来。
