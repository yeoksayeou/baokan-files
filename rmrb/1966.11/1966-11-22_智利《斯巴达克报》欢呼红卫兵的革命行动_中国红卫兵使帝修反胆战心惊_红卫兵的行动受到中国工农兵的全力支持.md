The Chilean revolutionary communist party organ, "Spartacus," recently published an article titled "Chinese Youth Will Never Change Their Colors," praising the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards as "an extraordinary revolutionary manifestation of the youth masses."

The article states that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chinese youth "with a revolutionary spirit, sweep away all reactionary old customs and habits."

The article points out that the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards have made imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries tremble with fear.

The article emphasizes: "The struggle of the Red Guards to destroy the Four Olds enjoys the full support of Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers, who regard them as excellent successors to the revolutionary tradition."

The article says, "The youth directly participate in this struggle, and through eliminating the reactionary remnants of the old society, they change the face of China. This is a great opportunity for them to be educated in practice and to achieve ideological transformation."

The article points out: The Chinese Communist Party has always educated the youth with the fine traditions of the Chinese people and the people of other countries in the world, making them remember the sufferings and exploitation their ancestors endured, as well as the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary martyrs; making them always care about the three-fifths of the oppressed and exploited people in the world who have not yet been liberated.

Therefore, "the thoughts of Chinese youth are closely related to the struggle of the Vietnamese people, the battle of the Dominican people, and all the struggles of the present day."

    红卫兵的行动受到中国工农兵的全力支持
    新华社讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利革命共产党机关报《斯巴达克报》最近发表题为《中国青年将永不变色》的文章，赞扬中国红卫兵的革命行动“是青少年群众一种了不起的革命表现”。
    文章说，中国青少年在中国共产党领导下和在无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，“以革命的气势，横扫一切反动的旧风俗、旧习惯”。
    文章指出，中国红卫兵的革命行动使帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派感到胆战心惊。
    文章强调说：“红卫兵大破四旧的斗争受到中国工农兵的全力支持，工农兵把他们看作是革命传统的优秀接班人。”
    文章说，“青年们直接参加这场斗争，通过扫除旧社会的反动残余来改变中国的面貌，这是他们在实践中受教育和实现思想革命化的大好机会。”
    文章指出：中国共产党一贯以本国人民和世界其它各国人民的优良传统来教育青年，使他们不忘记自己先辈所遭受过的痛苦和剥削，以及革命先烈的革命精神；使他们时刻关怀世界上还未解放的三分之二的被压迫被剥削的人民。
    因此，“中国青年的思想与越南人民的斗争、多米尼加人民的战斗以及当前的一切斗争息息相关”。
