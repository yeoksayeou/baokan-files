Tirana, November 18 (Xinhua) — The working people of Tirana, the capital of Albania, held a grand gathering on November 17 to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the city's liberation.

Albanian party and government leaders such as Balluku, Muftiu, and Kellezi attended the celebration.

Kellezi, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of Tirana, spoke at the celebration. He said that this year, we are celebrating the 22nd anniversary of Tirana's liberation in the revolutionary atmosphere of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania and the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Party of Labor. The name of Tirana is inseparable from the name of our party. Since November 8, 1941, Tirana has always held high the party's invincible banner, waged a heroic struggle against Nazi fascism, and written a glorious page in the history of the national liberation struggle.

Kellezi spoke about the great achievements made in the construction of Tirana after its liberation. He said that now, Tirana has become an industrial city. Its industrial production has increased 7.4 times compared to 1938. Kellezi called on the working people of Tirana to demonstrate the fighting spirit and creativity of the working class once again in carrying out the tasks of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor, to make the day of Tirana's liberation a turning point for launching a new labor enthusiasm, and to raise the red flag of socialist emulation higher.

Yakova, General Secretary of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions, also spoke at the meeting. He presented the honor certificates for the labor competition to welcome the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor and the 25th anniversary of the Party's founding to the city of Tirana.

After the meeting, artists performed a wonderful art program.

    新华社地拉那十八日电  阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那市劳动人民十七日集会，热烈庆祝地拉那解放二十二周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人巴卢库、穆夫蒂乌和凯莱齐等出席了庆祝会。
    地拉那市人民会议执行委员会主席凯莱齐在庆祝会上发表讲话说，今年我们是在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党举行第五次代表大会和劳动党成立二十五周年的革命气氛中庆祝地拉那解放二十二周年的。地拉那的名字是和我们党的名字联系在一起的。从一九四一年十一月八日起，地拉那就一直高举党的战无不胜的旗帜，进行了英勇的反抗纳粹法西斯的斗争，在民族解放斗争的历史上写下了光辉的一页。
    凯莱齐谈到地拉那在解放后的建设中取得的巨大成就时说，现在，地拉那已经变成为一个工业城市。它的工业生产比一九三八年提高了七点四倍。凯莱齐号召地拉那劳动人民在贯彻执行劳动党第五次代表大会的任务中，再次表现出工人阶级的战斗精神和创造性，把地拉那解放日变为掀起新的劳动热潮的转折点，更高地举起社会主义竞赛的红旗。
    阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会总书记雅科瓦也在会上讲了话，并把迎接劳动党第五次代表大会和建党二十五周年的劳动竞赛的荣誉奖状，授给了地拉那市。
    会后，文艺工作者演出了精彩的文艺节目。
