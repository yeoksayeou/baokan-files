Cuban Workers' Hearts Turn to Chairman Mao

They say: "Chairman Mao is the most correct, the most steadfast"; "Mao Zedong Thought has deeply rooted itself in the hearts of the broad masses of the Cuban people, and this is something no force can uproot."

		New China News Agency, November 11th

		Havana News: The Cuban people have boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically sing the praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

		In Cuba, many workers, upon seeing Chinese comrades, always raise their thumbs and say with deep emotion: "Mao Zedong!" This expresses their boundless respect for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

		Cuban workers have the deepest love for Chairman Mao. They express their admiration for Chairman Mao in the most explicit language. A construction worker said: "Chairman Mao is the most correct, the most steadfast. Chairman Mao not only concentrates the wisdom of the Chinese people but also the wisdom of the working people of the whole world, creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao truly deserves to be the leader of the world revolution." He also said: "Chairman Mao is often among the masses, trusts the masses, and unites the 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese people are truly fortunate to have such a wise leader."

		An old worker said: "I have a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in my home, and I also have a Chinese national flag. Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of our time. No matter what, this is my view." He said: "Chairman Mao works tirelessly, dedicating everything to the people."

		Cuban workers love to read Chairman Mao's books. A young auto mechanic said that he had read "On Contradiction" by Chairman Mao once before and recently read it twice more. He said: "The more I read 'On Contradiction,' the more I feel its content is very rich and very correct. It has strengthened my faith in Chairman Mao."

		Many Cubans have read the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume Four and other major works by Chairman Mao. A teacher said: "Cuban people love to read Chairman Mao's works. Whoever gets a copy of the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' feels very fortunate." A cultural worker said: "I have been reading Chairman Mao's works. I am so absorbed in reading Chairman Mao's books. Chairman Mao's works are so profound, so correct, and so great."

		Many Cubans are not satisfied with just having the Spanish version of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume Four. When they see Chinese comrades, they ask: "When will the Spanish version of the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' Volumes One, Two, and Three be published?"

		A Cuban friend said: "Some of Chairman Mao's works have been introduced to Cuba, contributing greatly to Cuba. Mao Zedong Thought has deeply rooted itself in the hearts of the broad masses of the Cuban people, and this is something no force can uproot."

		No matter what clouds appear in the sky, the Cuban workers always have boundless love for Chairman Mao. Their hearts yearn for Chairman Mao. This year in July, the news of Chairman Mao's swim across the Yangtze River reached Cuba. Many Cuban friends expressed warm congratulations to the Chinese comrades. A machine tool worker said: "When I heard that Chairman Mao swam across the Yangtze River again, I felt very happy. Chairman Mao's health is very good, not only making the Chinese people happy but also making all revolutionary people around the world happy." A Cuban from the countryside saw a picture of Chairman Mao on three stamps in a Chinese magazine, cut them out, and pasted them at home. He wrote a letter to the Chinese comrades saying: "As a Cuban, I admire your country and your dear leader Chairman Mao Zedong very much. If I could get a portrait of Chairman Mao, it would be a great honor for me."

    古巴劳动人民心向毛主席
    他们说：“毛主席最正确，最坚定”；“毛泽东思想在广大古巴人民心中已深深地扎下了根子，这是任何力量都不能拔掉的”
    新华社十一日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴人民无限热爱和敬仰毛主席，热情歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    在古巴，许多劳动人民见到中国同志时，总是竖起大拇指满怀深情地说：“毛泽东！”用以表达他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限崇敬。
    古巴工人热爱毛主席的感情最深，他们用最明确的语言来表达古巴工人阶级对毛主席的爱戴。一位建筑工人说：“毛主席最正确，最坚定。毛主席不仅集中了中国人民的智慧，也集中了全世界劳动人民的智慧，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛主席不愧为世界革命的领袖。”他还说：“毛主席经常和群众在一起，相信群众，把中国七亿人民统一起来。中国人民有这样一位英明的领袖真幸福。”
    一位老工人说：“我家里挂着毛主席像，我还有一面中国国旗。毛主席是当代最伟大的领袖。不管怎样，我就是这个看法。”他说：“毛主席辛勤地工作，把自己的一切都献给了人民。”
    古巴工人非常爱读毛主席的书。一位汽车修配青年工人说，他过去读过一遍毛主席的《矛盾论》，最近他又把这部著作重读了两遍。他说：“我越读越感到《矛盾论》的内容非常丰富、非常正确，它坚定了我对毛主席的信仰。”
    许多古巴人都读过《毛泽东选集》第四卷和毛主席的其它主要著作。一位教师说：“古巴人民都爱读毛主席著作。谁要是得到一本《毛泽东选集》，就感到十分幸福。”一位文化工作者说：“我一直阅读毛主席的著作。我阅读毛主席的书简直读得入迷了。毛主席的著作是多么深刻，多么正确，多么伟大。”
    许多古巴人有了西班牙文版的《毛泽东选集》第四卷还不满足。他们看到中国同志就问：“什么时候出版西班牙文的《毛泽东选集》第一、二、三卷？”
    一位古巴朋友说：“毛主席的一部分著作传入古巴，对古巴作出了很大的贡献。毛泽东思想在广大古巴人民心中已深深地扎下了根子，这是任何力量都不能拔掉的。”
    不管天空出现什么乌云，古巴劳动人民总是无限热爱毛主席，他们的心向往着毛主席。今年七月，毛主席畅游长江的消息传到古巴，许多古巴朋友向中国同志表示热烈祝贺。一个机床工人说：“当我知道毛主席再次畅游长江的时候，感到很高兴。毛主席身体十分健康，不但使中国人民高兴，而且使全世界革命人民都感到高兴。”一个内地的古巴人在中国杂志上看到了印着毛主席像的三张邮票，他把邮票剪下来贴在家里，并写信给中国同志说：“作为一个古巴人，我对你们国家，对你们亲爱的领袖毛泽东主席非常钦佩。如果我能得到一张毛主席的画像，对我来说将是莫大的光荣。”
