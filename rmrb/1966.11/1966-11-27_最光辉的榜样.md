Our great leader Chairman Mao, since August of this year, in a span of over three months, has successively received and reviewed over 11 million soldiers of the proletarian cultural revolution. This is an unprecedented great initiative in the history of the Chinese proletarian revolution, as well as in the history of the international communist movement.

Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, and the masses love Chairman Mao the most. During the proletarian cultural revolution, Chairman Mao met with so many masses, personally went among the masses, stayed with the masses, and shared their breath and destiny. Chairman Mao respects the masses' spirit of initiative the most. The Red Guards, the mass rallies, and other creations of the masses were all first discovered and enthusiastically supported by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has set the most glorious example for us.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."

A thoroughgoing mass viewpoint and a thoroughgoing mass line run through Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice and through the great Mao Zedong Thought.

During the seventh review of the cultural revolution army, Chairman Mao told some responsible comrades who participated in the reception: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, stay with the masses, and make the proletarian cultural revolution even better."

The revolutionary line of the proletariat, represented by Chairman Mao, is fundamentally a mass line. The proletarian cultural revolution is a fierce attack by hundreds of millions of masses against a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, against the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and against all monsters and demons. Only by completely, thoroughly, and unconditionally implementing Chairman Mao's mass line can we carry out this great revolution that touches the depths of people's souls.

The reactionary line of the bourgeoisie is the opposite. Some comrades are afraid of the masses and afraid of the revolution. They are afraid to meet with the masses, afraid of great democracy, afraid of big-character posters on the streets, and afraid of mass rallies. They are afraid of this and that, afraid that the revolution will reach them, and afraid of losing their official hats. Thus, they consciously or unconsciously come into conflict with the proletarian cultural revolution and with the revolutionary mass movement.

Therefore, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's theory on the mass line, take Chairman Mao's great practice as our example, trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, respect the masses' spirit of initiative, and enthusiastically support the masses' revolutionary actions. Only by implementing Chairman Mao's mass line can we make the proletarian cultural revolution even better, and on the basis of ideological revolutionization, make production and all work even better.

To implement Chairman Mao's mass line, the primary issue is to firmly stand on the proletarian standpoint, consider everything from the people's interests, and wholeheartedly serve the people, never separating from the masses. If we do this, we can improve our relationship with the masses, truly blend with the masses, and be closely connected with the masses, saying what the masses want to say and doing what the masses want to do. Otherwise, if we act like officials and lords, regard ourselves as the masters of the masses, and see ourselves as nobles towering over the "lower classes," then, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "no matter how great their talents, they are not needed by the masses, and their work has no future."

During the proletarian cultural revolution, some comrades have made various mistakes in their attitude towards the masses. These comrades should correct their mistakes by firmly following Chairman Mao's instructions, going among the masses, staying with the masses, humbly accepting the masses' criticisms, seriously examining their mistakes, and, under the help and supervision of the masses, fundamentally transforming their worldview. As Chairman Mao said: "As long as we persist in what is correct for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will definitely grow stronger."

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, inspired by Chairman Mao's glorious example, with the help and support of the broad revolutionary masses, keep revolutionizing, and march forward forever!

    最光辉的榜样
    任立新
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，从今年八月以来的三个多月中，先后八次接见和检阅了一千一百多万无产阶级文化革命大军。这是中国无产阶级革命史上，也是国际共产主义运动史上前所未有的伟大创举。
    毛主席最信任群众，群众最热爱毛主席。在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席同那么多的群众见面，亲自到群众里面去，同群众在一起，和群众同呼吸，共命运。毛主席最尊重群众的首创精神，红卫兵、大串连等等群众的创造，都是毛主席首先发现并且热情支持的。毛主席为我们树立了最光辉的榜样。
    毛主席经常教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    彻底的群众观点，彻底的群众路线，贯穿于毛主席的伟大革命实践之中，贯穿于伟大的毛泽东思想之中。
    在第七次检阅文化革命大军的时候，毛主席对参加接见的一些负责同志说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，从根本上说，就是群众路线。无产阶级文化大革命，是亿万群众对一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，对一切牛鬼蛇神展开的猛烈攻击。只有完全地、彻底地、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的群众路线，才能把这场触及人们灵魂深处的大革命搞深搞透。
    资产阶级的反动路线恰恰相反。有的同志害怕群众，害怕革命。他们怕同群众见面，怕大民主，怕大字报上街，怕大串连。他们怕这怕那，就是怕革命革到自己头上来，怕丢掉自己的乌纱帽。这样，他们自觉不自觉地同无产阶级文化大革命抵触起来了，同革命的群众运动抵触起来了。
    因此，我们一定要努力学习毛主席关于群众路线的理论，以毛主席的伟大实践为榜样，信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，热情地支持群众的革命行动。只有贯彻执行毛主席的群众路线，我们才能够把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，并且在思想革命化的基础上，把生产和一切工作搞得更好。
    要贯彻执行毛主席的群众路线，首要的问题，就是要坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，一切都从人民的利益出发，全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众。我们这样做，就能够搞好同群众的关系，真正同群众打成一片，同群众息息相关，心心相连，说群众要说的话，做群众要做的事。否则，做官当老爷，把自己看作群众的主人，看作高踞于“下等人”头上的贵族，那末，这种人就会像毛主席所指出的：“不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，有些同志在对待群众问题上，犯了这样那样的错误。这些同志要纠正自己的错误，最好的办法，就是坚决按照毛主席的指示，到群众里面去，同群众在一起，虚心地接受群众的批评，认真地检查自己的错误，在群众的帮助和监督下，从根本上改造自己的世界观。正如毛主席所说的：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在毛主席光辉榜样的鼓舞下，在广大革命群众的帮助和支持下，不断革命，永远前进吧！
