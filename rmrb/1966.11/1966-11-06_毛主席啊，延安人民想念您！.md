Chairman Mao, the people of Yan'an miss you!

On November 3rd, I finally realized my long-cherished wish in front of Tiananmen Gate: I saw the great leader Chairman Mao.

Mountain flowers bloom red all over,
We are the little red soldiers born in Yan'an.
Thousands of times we sing "The East Is Red,"
Day and night we miss Chairman Mao.
Looking up, I see the top of the pagoda,
When can I go to Beijing?
Looking down, I see the water of Yan River,
When can I see Chairman Mao?
The sound of reading in Yangjialing and the lights in Zhaoyuan,
When will Chairman Mao revisit Yan'an?
The cave dwellings on Fenghuang Mountain shine with golden light,
Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts.
In my dreams, I shout "Long live!" again and again,
The people of Yan'an miss you, beloved Chairman Mao!

    毛主席啊，延安人民想念您！
    十一月三日，我在天安门前终于实现了日想夜盼的心愿：见到了
    伟大领袖毛主席。
    山丹丹开花满山红，
    我们是延安生的红小兵。
    千次万次高唱《东方红》，
    日日夜夜想念毛主席。
    抬头望见宝塔的顶，
    什么时候能到北京城？
    低头看见延河的水，
    什么时候能见毛主席？
    杨家岭的书声枣园的灯，
    毛主席啥时重访延安城？
    凤凰山的窑洞金光亮，
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。
    睡梦里声连声高呼万岁，
    延安人想您啊，敬爱的毛主席！
