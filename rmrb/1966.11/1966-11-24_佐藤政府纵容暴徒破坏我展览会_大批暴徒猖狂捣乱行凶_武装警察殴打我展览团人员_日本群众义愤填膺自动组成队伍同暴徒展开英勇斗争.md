A large number of thugs ran amok, causing chaos and violence. Armed police beat members of the Chinese exhibition team. The Japanese public, filled with indignation, spontaneously formed groups to bravely fight against the thugs.

	TOKYO, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) — Under the protection of the Sato government, on the afternoon and evening of the 22nd, right-wing thugs in Japan stormed the economic and trade exhibition organized by China in Nagoya, causing chaos and destruction. They also assaulted and injured members of the Japanese Cooperation Association, a Chinese overseas compatriot, and staff of the Chinese exhibition team.

	Japanese spectators and friends who came to visit the exhibition bravely fought to defend the Chinese economic and trade exhibition, successfully thwarting this plot.

	Since the opening of the Chinese exhibition on the 19th of this month, right-wing thugs have repeatedly caused disturbances at the exhibition site. These thugs distributed anti-China leaflets, threw incendiary devices, and even shouted slanders against Chinese leaders. Although the Japanese side of the Chinese exhibition cooperation association had repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese police authorities, no effective measures were taken.

	On the 22nd at noon, Xiao Xiangqian, the leader of the Chinese exhibition team, warned the Japanese authorities at a reception for Tokyo and Osaka friendly trade circles about this issue. He solemnly pointed out that if such hostile behavior against China continues, the Japanese government will be held responsible for all consequences.

	However, at 2:20 p.m., more than 200 right-wing thugs arrived in more than 20 cars at the west end of the exhibition square. Through the loudspeakers on the cars, they maliciously slandered China and its leaders. The cars also had slogans reading "Smash the Communist Party of China Exhibition." These thugs blocked the propaganda car of the Chinese exhibition cooperation association, which was driving normally on the road, and used violence to smash the car windows and destroy the loudspeakers inside, injuring the driver and a member of the Japanese cooperation association inside the car. More than 20 members of the Japanese cooperation association who went to protect the propaganda car and the driver were also beaten by the thugs.

	All of these actions by the thugs were carried out in front of a large number of police dispatched by the Japanese authorities. The police authorities not only did not arrest these thugs who were causing trouble, but also allowed them to cause chaos at the Chinese exhibition square for nearly 30 minutes. This situation aroused great anger and dissatisfaction among many Japanese spectators who came to visit the exhibition. Some spectators condemned, saying: Such behavior of protecting thugs causing trouble at the Chinese exhibition is unacceptable. This is not accidental; it is a manifestation of the Sato government's long-standing hostility towards great China! Other spectators said: China came to Japan to hold an exhibition for the sake of friendship. At the exhibition site, there are such a small group of thugs causing trouble, which is truly shameful.

	Many Japanese friends and spectators showed high-spirited bravery to defend the exhibition. Friends from the friendly trade circles in Tokyo and Osaka, who had not yet had the chance to enter the exhibition, organized a team of more than 80 young people to participate in the struggle upon hearing the news of the thugs causing trouble. The Aichi Prefectural Federation of Trade Unions sent more than 40 young people to support the cause. Friends from the Chubu Japan Cooperation Association also bravely participated in this struggle. These friends formed a human wall on one side of the road in front of the exhibition square, holding hands. They angrily shouted, "Thugs, go back!" "Do not destroy Sino-Japanese friendship!" "Defend Sino-Japanese friendship!" The righteous and powerful slogans scared the small group of thugs away.

	In the afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the Chinese exhibition team and the Japanese cooperation association held a press conference. The spokesperson of the Chinese exhibition team, Ren Jianxin, issued a statement strongly protesting the Japanese government's behavior of protecting thugs to disrupt the Chinese exhibition.

	Kawase Kazuo, the chairman of the Japanese cooperation association, and Tanaka Kenichiro, the chairman of the Chubu Japan cooperation association, told reporters: Such behavior not only disrupts Sino-Japanese friendship but also violates international trust and international morality.

	In the evening at 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd, the Japanese right-wing group sent another batch of thugs in a propaganda car to the exhibition site to provoke trouble. This propaganda car circled the exhibition site again and again. The thugs shouted anti-China slogans. A large number of armed police not only did not stop them but also, when members of the Japanese cooperation association, overseas Chinese, and the Chinese exhibition team angrily went out to stop them, brutally used force to block them, injuring a young overseas Chinese. Two translators from the Chinese exhibition team were also beaten with police batons. The police's violence made the people on the scene extremely angry. They protested to the plainclothes police officer in charge, but this police officer refused to admit his mistake. The Aichi Prefectural Police also sent the head of the security department, who still evaded the facts and refused to admit his mistake.

	Xiao Xiangqian, the leader of the Chinese exhibition team, through the responsible person of the cooperation association, strongly protested the police's violence. He pointed out that after the right-wing group caused trouble and injured members of the cooperation association this afternoon, another incident occurred where Japanese police beat members of the Chinese exhibition team and overseas Chinese, which is a very serious incident. He said that if the Japanese authorities do not take measures, all consequences must be borne by the Japanese government and the Nagoya police authorities.

	The Chinese exhibition team and the Japanese cooperation association held another press conference that evening.

	The spokesperson of the Chinese exhibition team, Ren Jianxin, angrily protested again to the Japanese authorities, reiterating the demand that the Sato government punish the criminals and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

    佐藤政府纵容暴徒破坏我展览会
    大批暴徒猖狂捣乱行凶　武装警察殴打我展览团人员
    日本群众义愤填膺自动组成队伍同暴徒展开英勇斗争
    新华社二十三日讯  东京消息：在佐藤政府的纵容下，二十二日下午和傍晚，日本右翼团体的暴徒疯狂地闯到中国在名古屋市举行的经济贸易展览会广场前进行捣乱和破坏，并且行凶打伤了日本协力会的人员和一名华侨以及中国展览团的工作人员。
    参观展览会的日本观众和朋友为保卫中国经济贸易展览会进行了英勇的斗争，胜利地粉碎了这个阴谋。
    从中国展览会于本月十九日开幕以来，就曾连续发生右翼暴徒在展览会场前进行捣乱的事件，这些暴徒散发反对中国的传单、投掷燃烧筒，甚至叫嚷诬蔑中国领导人。虽然经过中国展览会日本协力会方面几次交涉，日本警察当局并没有采取有效的措施。
    中国展览团团长萧向前就这一问题，曾在二十二日中午在欢迎东京、大阪友好贸易界人士的会上向日本当局提出警告，他严正指出，如果这种敌视中国的行为发展下去，一切后果由日本政府负责。
    但是，下午二时二十分，又有右翼暴徒二百多人分乘二十余辆汽车，出现在展览会广场前的西端，暴徒们通过车上的扩音器，恣意地诽谤中国和中国领导人，暴徒的车上，还写着“粉碎中共展览会”的标语。这些暴徒竟然拦阻在马路上正常行驶的中国展览会日本协力会的宣传车，使用暴力捣坏车窗，破坏了车内的扩音器，打伤了司机和车内的日本协力会的一名人员。二十多名日本协力会的人员，去保卫宣传车和司机时，也遭到暴徒的殴打。
    暴徒的所有这一切行动都是在日本当局出动的大批警察面前公然进行的。警察当局不仅没有逮捕这些行凶的暴徒，而且纵容它们在中国展览会广场前捣乱将近三十分钟。这种情况，激起了许多来参观展览会的日本观众的极大愤怒和不满。有的观众谴责说：这种纵容暴徒在中国展览会前闹事的行为是不能容许的。这不是偶然的，是佐藤政府一贯敌视伟大中国的表现！还有的观众说：中国是为了友好，才到日本举行展览会的。在中国展览会会场前，竟然有这么一小撮暴徒捣乱，真可耻。
    广大日本朋友和观众，为保卫展览会表现了高尚的勇敢精神。从东京、大阪前来参观的友好贸易界的朋友，还没有来得及进场参观，听到这些暴徒捣乱的消息后，自行组织了有八十多名青年参加的队伍，参加斗争。爱知县地方工会评议会派来了四十多名青年来支援。中部日本协力会的朋友，也英勇地参加了这一斗争。这些朋友在展览会广场前的马路一侧，手挽着手结成一个人墙。他们愤怒地高呼“暴徒们，滚回去！”“不准破坏日中友好！”“保卫日中友好！”正气磅礴的口号，吓得这一小撮暴徒灰溜溜地跑掉了。
    当天下午四时，中国展览团和日本协力会举行记者招待会，中国展览团发言人任健新，发表声明严重抗议日本政府这种纵容暴徒破坏中国展览会的行为。
    日本协力会会长川濑一贯和中部日本协力会会长田中均一郎向记者表示：这种行为，不仅是破坏日中友好的行为，而且是违背国际信义和国际道义的行为。
    二十二日傍晚六时，日本右翼团体又派了一批暴徒乘坐一辆宣传车到展览会场周围寻衅。这辆宣传车一次又一次围绕着展览会场转，暴徒们大放反华厥词，大批武装警察，不仅不去制止，反而在日本协力会人员、华侨和中国展览团人员愤然要出去制止时，竟野蛮地用武力阻拦，打伤华侨青年一人。中国展览团的翻译两人也遭到警察的木棒的殴打。日本警察的这种暴行，使在场人员极为愤怒，他们向在场的便衣警察负责人抗议，而这个警察却拒不承认错误。爱知县警察当局派来警备部长，也依然抵赖事实不肯承认错误。
    中国展览团长萧向前通过协力会的负责人对日本警察当局的这种暴行提出了严重抗议。他指出，继今天下午右翼团体捣乱、打伤协力会人员之后，又发生了日本警察殴打中国展览团人员和华侨的事件，这是极为严重的事件。他说，如果日本当局不采取措施，一切后果必须由日本政府当局和名古屋警察当局负责。
    中国展览团和日本协力会当晚又举行了记者招待会。
    中国展览团发言人任健新愤怒地再次向日本当局提出严重抗议，重申要求佐藤政府惩办罪犯，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
