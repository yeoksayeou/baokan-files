The Soviet revisionist leadership group, in order to tighten its collusion with Japanese reactionaries, recently used the "Exhibition of Modern Masterpieces from the Soviet State Art Museum" held in Tokyo as a cover, dispatching Cultural Minister Furtseva to Japan for a ten-day activity.

This Furtseva, who was granted three days of state guest treatment by the Japanese government, just arrived in Tokyo on October 20 and immediately issued a statement at Haneda Airport, currying favor with the Japanese reactionaries. She said: "I hope that through talks with the Japanese government and private individuals, we can deepen the understanding between the Soviet Union and Japan in the political and cultural fields."

According to a report by the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* on the 29th, Furtseva, when visiting Japanese Prime Minister Sato, went out of her way to flatter Sato. She said in a fawning manner that Sato would receive "one hundred and twenty percent hospitality" if he visited the Soviet Union. Sato replied: "Japan also hopes to send cabinet members to visit the Soviet Union and engage in extensive Soviet-Japanese cultural exchanges."

According to the report, on October 21, Furtseva held talks with Japanese Minister of Education Arata Kichiichi and reached "a consensus" on the extensive promotion of Soviet-Japanese cultural exchanges.

    苏修集团拚命向日本反动派讨好
    福尔采娃到东京拉拢佐藤并请求他访苏
    据新华社讯　东京消息：苏联修正主义领导集团为了加紧勾结日本反动派，最近利用在东京举行“苏联国立美术馆现代名画展览会”作幌子，派出文化部长福尔采娃到日本进行长达十天的活动。
    这位被日本政府给予三天国宾待遇的福尔采娃，十月二十日刚到东京，就在羽田机场发表声明，向日本反动派大献殷勤。她说：“希望通过同日本政府和民间人士举行的会谈，加深苏日之间在政治方面和文化方面的理解。”
    据《日本经济新闻》二十九日报道，福尔采娃在拜访日本首相佐藤时极力讨好佐藤，她肉麻地说，佐藤如果访苏将受到“一百二十分的款待”。佐藤回答说：“日本也希望派阁僚访苏，大搞日苏文化交流。”
    据报道，十月二十一日，福尔采娃同日本文部大臣有田喜一举行了会谈，就苏日大搞文化交流取得了“一致意见”。
