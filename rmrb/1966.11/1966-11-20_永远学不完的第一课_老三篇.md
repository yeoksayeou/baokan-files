The First Lesson That Can Never Be Learned Enough – “The Three Articles”

Shen Xiuying, Party Branch Secretary of Xiyonggu Village, Dongfeng Commune, Shiquanshan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region

I am not very literate, and I have only been studying Chairman Mao's works for a short time. However, in these few years, I have deeply felt that: Chairman Mao's works are our guide to action and the foundation of the revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we have a direction to solve problems, we have the energy to produce, and our work goes smoothly; without it, we can lose our way even in broad daylight.

The second production team's poor peasant woman, Ma Fengzhen, used to be quite selfish. Some team members did not want to get close to her, and the cadres often criticized her. She became more and more distant from everyone. My home is not far from hers, and I had tried to help her before, but she always ignored me. Not being able to unite the class sisters made me feel very sad. I thought: why doesn't she want to get close to me? It's because I approached her with a "trial" attitude. Chairman Mao teaches us to care about the people's lives and pay attention to work methods. I was wrong, so I started over. I began by caring about her life, helping her solve specific difficulties, and gradually got close to her. In casual conversations, I talked to her about the bitterness of the old society. This time, she didn't ignore me but poured out all the bitterness of the old society. I seized this opportunity to give her class education by comparing the old and new societies, helping her recognize her shortcomings. Then, we studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together. She couldn't read, so I read it to her over and over. She said: "Comrade Zhang Side is a person who works wholeheartedly for the people's interests. I used to work for my own interests, which is wrong. From now on, I must do more good deeds for the people." Afterwards, she really changed. Every time there was a study session, she came early without being called, listened carefully, remembered what she heard, and applied it to her work. She also worked more enthusiastically, actively boiling water for those who cut wheat, mending clothes, and using rest time to fertilize and build pens for the team, doing many good deeds. Everyone was happy about her progress. Recently, she was elected by the team members as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and attended the Shiquanshan City Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works.

To achieve the revolutionization of thought, our branch's first lesson is to study "The Three Articles." Through the study of "The Three Articles," the ideological outlook of our leadership team has changed greatly, selfish thoughts have been greatly reduced, and revolutionary spirit has been greatly enhanced. The power of Mao Zedong Thought is indeed great. Our village party branch will forever regard "The Three Articles" as the first lesson that can never be learned enough.

    永远学不完的第一课——“老三篇”
    宁夏回族自治区石咀山市东风公社西永固大队党支部书记  沈秀英
    我识字不多，学习毛主席著作的时间也不长。但是，就在这短短的几年里，我深深体会到：毛主席著作是我们行动的指针，革命的根本。脑子里有了毛泽东思想，解决问题就有方向，生产就有劲头，工作就顺当；没有它，大白天也会迷失方向。
    第二生产队贫农女社员马凤珍过去比较自私，有些社员不愿和她接近，干部也老是批评她，她越来越和大伙离得远。我的家离她家不远，以前我也试着去帮助过她，可她老不理我。没有把阶级姐妹团结好，我心里很难过。我想：她为啥不理我呢？是因为我抱着“试”的态度去接近她的。毛主席教导我们要关心群众生活，注意工作方法。我错了，就从头来。我就从关心她的生活入手，帮助她解决具体困难，慢慢地和她接近了。在闲谈中，我和她谈起了旧社会的苦。这回，她不是不理我，而是把旧社会的苦水都倒了出来。我抓住这一点，对她进行了新旧社会对比的阶级教育，使她对自己的缺点有了认识。接着，我们一起学习了《为人民服务》。她不识字，我一遍又一遍地念给她听。她说：“张思德同志是彻底地为人民的利益工作的，我过去是为自己的利益劳动的，这是不对的。往后我一定要为人民多做好事。”以后，她真的变了，每次学习不用人喊，就早早来了，细心听，用脑子记，还能用到点子上。她干活也积极了，主动地给割麦的人烧开水，补衣服，利用休息时间给队上积肥垫圈，做了许多好事，大伙都为她的进步而高兴。最近她被社员选为学习毛主席著作积极分子，出席了石咀山市学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议。
    为了实现思想革命化，我们支部生活的第一课便是学习“老三篇”。通过“老三篇”的学习，我们领导班子的思想面貌大变样，私心杂念大大减少，革命精神大振。毛泽东思想的威力就是大，我们大队党支部要永远把“老三篇”当作学不完的第一课。
