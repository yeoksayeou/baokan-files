Comrades and Red Guards:

In the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have come to Beijing with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. You have come to see Chairman Mao and to exchange revolutionary experiences. On behalf of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party, I extend to you the warmest welcome!

Today, Chairman Mao is very pleased to receive you. This is the sixth time in the past two months, including National Day, that Chairman Mao has received revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from all over the country. Chairman Mao is the greatest proletarian revolutionary. He always stands with the masses, fully trusts the masses, shares their joys and sorrows, and wholeheartedly supports the revolutionary mass movement. Chairman Mao has set a brilliant example for all Party members and the younger generation.

The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent! The vast mass movement is surging forward, growing more intense day by day. The entire social landscape and people's spiritual outlook have undergone tremendous changes. The great thought of Mao Zedong is more widely spread and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Under Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," the Cultural Revolution has promoted the ideological transformation of people, pushed forward the leapfrog development of industrial and agricultural production and science and technology. The recent successful test launch of a missile and nuclear weapon is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory of the proletarian cultural revolution!

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee proclaimed the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line. In the past two months, Chairman Mao's correct line has been communicated to the broad masses, who have grasped it and launched a criticism of the wrong line. Chairman Mao's call for everyone to care about state affairs has truly become the action of the broad masses. This is a great thing. This is an important guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao's line is a line of letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. It is a line of "daring" to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses. This is the application and new development of the Party's mass line in the Cultural Revolution. This is the line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The bourgeois line is opposed to the mass line. It is a line that opposes the masses educating themselves and liberating themselves. It is a line of suppressing the masses and opposing the revolution. This bourgeois reactionary line does not direct the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society, but against the revolutionary masses, using various means to incite the masses to fight each other, to incite students to fight each other.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is incompatible with the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating its influence can we correctly, completely, and thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's line.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, the revolutionary masses of our country have created new experiences in developing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This great democracy is the Party fearlessly allowing the broad masses to use the forms of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big connections to criticize and supervise the Party and state organs at all levels and their leaders. At the same time, according to the principles of the Paris Commune, fully realizing the democratic rights of the people. Without this great democracy, it is impossible to launch a genuine Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to achieve a great revolution in people's souls, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a deeper level, to uproot revisionism, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to ensure that our country advances along the path of socialism and communism. This great democracy is a new form of the combination of Mao Zedong Thought and the broad masses, a new form of the masses educating themselves. This great democracy is Chairman Mao's new contribution to the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

The historical experience of international proletarian dictatorship proves that without such a thorough Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and without implementing such great democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat will be weakened, will degenerate, and capitalism will use various forms to restore itself, and the exploiting classes will once again ride on the heads of the people.

Such great democracy must be thoroughly implemented not only between the leadership and the masses but also among the masses themselves. Without such great democracy among the masses, without the ability to consult with each other, listen to different opinions, present facts and reason, think independently, and solve problems, it is impossible to educate oneself and liberate oneself, impossible to achieve the goal of developing the leftist forces, uniting the majority, and isolating a handful of rightists, and impossible to fully implement the line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by our great leader, Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao supports your on-foot connections. The advantage of on-foot connections is that you can widely contact the masses and various aspects of society, gain a deeper understanding of class struggle in socialist society, and better learn from workers and peasants. In a broader scope, you can spread Mao Zedong Thought. This is very beneficial for revolutionary teachers and students to further understand Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's correct line. Of course, such on-foot connections must be carried out in a planned, organized, and prepared manner.

The Party Central Committee believes that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already gained several months of experience and will be carried out even better in the future, achieving even greater successes!

Advance under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's line!

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

### 在接见全国各地来京革命师生大会上  林彪同志的讲话

    在接见全国各地来京革命师生大会上
    林彪同志的讲话
    新华社三日讯　林彪同志在接见全国各地来京革命师生大会上的讲话，全文如下：同学们，同志们，红卫兵战士们：
    在全国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，你们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚的心情，来到北京，看望毛主席，同时，交流革命经验。我代表毛主席，代表党中央，向你们表示最热烈的欢迎！
    今天，毛主席非常高兴地接见你们。这是两个多月来，连国庆节在内，毛主席第六次接见来自全国各地的革命师生和红卫兵。毛主席是最伟大的无产阶级革命家，他总是同群众在一起，充分地信任群众，和群众同呼吸，共命运，全心全意支持革命的群众运动。毛主席给全党同志，给青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命的形势很好！巨大规模的群众运动，轰轰烈烈，一天比一天深入。整个社会面貌，人们的精神面貌，都有很大的变化。伟大的毛泽东思想更加普及，更加深入人心。在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召下，文化大革命促进了人的思想革命化，推动了工农业生产和科学技术的飞跃发展。最近发射导弹核武器的试验成功，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化革命的伟大胜利！
    党的八届十一中全会，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产。两个多月来，毛主席的正确路线同广大群众见面，为广大群众所掌握，展开了对错误路线的批判。毛主席号召大家关心国家大事，真正变成了广大群众的行动。这是极大的好事。这是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要保证。
    毛主席的路线，是让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的路线，是“敢”字当头的路线，是敢于相信群众，敢于依靠群众，敢于放手发动群众的路线。这是党的群众路线在文化大革命中的运用和新发展。这是无产阶级文化大革命的路线。
    资产阶级路线，是反对群众路线，是反对群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的路线，是压制群众，反对革命的路线。这条资产阶级反动路线，不是把斗争的矛头指向一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，而是指向革命群众，采取各种形式，挑动群众斗群众，挑动学生斗学生。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线，是水火不相容的。只有彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除这条路线的影响，才能正确地、完全地、彻底地执行毛主席的路线。
    在毛主席正确路线的指引下，我国广大革命群众，创造了无产阶级专政下发展大民主的新经验。这种大民主，就是党无所畏惧地让广大群众运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的形式，批评和监督党和国家的各级领导机关和各级领导人。同时，按照巴黎公社的原则，充分实现人民民主权利。没有这种大民主，不可能发动真正的无产阶级文化大革命，不可能实现人们灵魂深处的大革命，不可能把无产阶级文化大革命搞深搞透，不可能挖掉修正主义的根子，不可能巩固无产阶级专政，不可能保证我们国家沿着社会主义、共产主义的道路前进。这种大民主，是毛泽东思想同广大群众相结合的新形式，是群众自己教育自己的新形式。这种大民主，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的新贡献。
    国际无产阶级专政的历史经验证明，没有进行这样彻底的无产阶级文化大革命，没有实行这样的大民主，无产阶级专政就会削弱，就会变质，资本主义就要采用各种形式复辟，剥削阶级就会重新骑在人民的头上。
    这样大民主，不但领导和群众之间必须彻底实行，而且，在群众中，在群众相互之间，也完全必须彻底实行。在群众之间，没有这样的大民主，不善于互相商量，不善于倾听不同的意见，不善于摆事实讲道理，不善于开动脑筋，思考问题，这样，就不可能自己教育自己，自己解放自己，就不可能达到发展左派队伍，团结大多数，孤立一小撮资产阶级右派的目的，就不可能不折不扣地实行我们伟大导师——毛主席所提出的无产阶级文化大革命的路线。
    毛主席是支持同志们步行串连的。步行串连的好处，可以广泛地接触群众，接触社会的各个方面，更深入了解社会主义社会的阶级斗争。可以更好地向工农学习，在更宽广的范围内，传播毛泽东思想。这样做，对于革命师生进一步领会毛泽东思想，领会毛主席的正确路线，是大有好处的。当然，这种步行串连，必须有计划、有组织、有准备地进行。
    党中央相信，无产阶级文化大革命已经有了几个月的经验，今后将会更好地进行，取得更大的成就！
    在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下前进！
    毛主席的路线胜利万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
