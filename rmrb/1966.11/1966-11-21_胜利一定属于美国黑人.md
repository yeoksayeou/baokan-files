Every time I read in the newspaper about the struggles of American blacks against racial discrimination, my heart is filled with excitement. I often think about how I, a former Tibetan serf who suffered endless oppression, was able to stand up and become a deputy county magistrate of the people. My personal experience makes me firmly believe that the just struggle of American blacks will surely triumph.

Chairman Mao said: "The question of race is essentially a class question," and "National struggles, in the final analysis, are class struggles." Chairman Mao's words are the truth, and they resonate deeply with the hearts of the Tibetan people, also pointing the way for the struggles of American blacks.

Before liberation, Tibet was a living hell. Everything in the sky and on the ground belonged to the lords. The wicked serf owners feasted on the flesh and blood of slaves, living a life of debauchery. Millions of Tibetans were slaves for generations, living a miserable life worse than cattle. Our suffering was the result of class exploitation; our hatred was the result of class oppression.

The reactionary ruling class always tries to use the guise of national and racial conflicts to cover up the essence of class conflicts.

After the liberation of Tibet, the traitor Dalai and his pack of wolves incited, "Those who eat tsampa must unite to overthrow the Han people!" Such fallacies, of course, could not deceive the awakened Tibetan people. Our response was to emphasize class and class oppression, to wage class struggle, to unite the laboring people of all nationalities, and to overthrow our common class enemy. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we finally overthrew the three great lords, smashed the darkest and most barbaric serf system, and truly gained liberation.

In the United States, the 20 million American blacks are like the Tibetan people before liberation, living in a state of slavery and oppression. The American ruling class creates racial discrimination to incite conflict between whites and blacks, dividing the unity of the American laboring people. However, as Chairman Mao said: "In the United States, it is only the reactionary ruling clique among the white people that oppresses the blacks. They cannot represent the white people, who make up the overwhelming majority of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other enlightened individuals." The broad masses of white people in the United States, who are cruelly exploited by the reactionary ruling class, sympathize with and support the struggles of blacks. The increasingly awakened American blacks recognize that their true enemy is the reactionary ruling class of the United States and that only by overthrowing the imperialist system of the United States can they achieve liberation. Therefore, they bravely take up revolutionary violence to confront counter-revolutionary violence, despite the enemy's brutal suppression. The struggles of American blacks have become a powerful force in the struggles of the American people.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose to prosperity with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will surely come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

The road to liberation for American blacks is still arduous, but their struggles, with the support of the people of the world, will surely achieve final victory.

    胜利一定属于美国黑人
    每当从报纸上看到美国黑人反对种族歧视斗争的消息，我心里总是非常激动。我常常联想到自己怎样从一个受尽压迫的西藏农奴，翻身当上了人民的副县长。我的亲身经历，使我深信，美国黑人的正义斗争是一定会胜利的。
    毛主席说：“种族问题实质上是阶级问题”，
  “民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”毛主席的话，字字句句是真理，说到了我们藏族人民的心坎上，也给美国黑人的斗争指明了方向。
    解放前的西藏是人间地狱。天上一只鸟，地上一根草，都是属于领主的。万恶的农奴主，吃奴隶的肉，喝奴隶的血，过着花天酒地的生活。千千万万藏族人民却是祖祖辈辈当奴隶，过着牛马不如的悲惨生活。我们的苦，是阶级剥削的苦；我们的仇，是阶级压迫的仇。
    反动统治阶级总是企图利用民族矛盾、种族矛盾的外衣，来掩盖阶级矛盾的实质。
    在西藏解放以后，叛国犯达赖这一伙豺狼，就煽动“吃糌粑的人都要团结起来打倒赤汉人！”这种谬论当然欺骗不了已经觉醒的西藏人民。我们的回答，就是大讲阶级和阶级压迫，大搞阶级斗争，团结各民族的劳动人民，打倒共同的阶级敌人。在毛主席和共产党的领导下，我们终于推翻了三大领主，砸烂了最黑暗最野蛮的农奴制度，真正得到了解放。
    在美国，两千万美国黑人，正像解放前的西藏人民一样，处在被奴役、被压迫的地位。美国统治集团制造种族歧视来挑动白人和黑人之间的矛盾，分化美国劳动人民的团结。但是，正像毛主席所说的：“在美国压迫黑人的，只是白色人种中的反动统治集团。他们绝不能代表白色人种中占绝大多数的工人、农民、革命的知识分子和其他开明人士。”深受反动统治阶级残酷剥削的美国广大白人是同情和支持黑人斗争的。日益觉醒的美国黑人认识到他们的真正敌人是美国的反动统治阶级，认识到只有摧毁美国的帝国主义制度才能使自己得到解放。因此，他们不顾敌人的残酷镇压，开始走上了以革命的暴力对付反革命的暴力的道路。美国黑人的斗争，已经成为美国人民斗争中一支巨大的力量。
    毛主席指出：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    美国黑人解放斗争的道路虽然还是很艰苦的，但是他们的斗争在世界人民的支持下，必将取得最后的胜利。
