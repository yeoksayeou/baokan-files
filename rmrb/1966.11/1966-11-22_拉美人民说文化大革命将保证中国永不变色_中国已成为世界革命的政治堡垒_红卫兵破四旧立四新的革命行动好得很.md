Latin American people continue to express their views, enthusiastically praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao and warmly applauding the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards.

A student from Bolivia said: "Mao Zedong is the initiator of the cultural revolution in the communist movement. Chairman Mao is truly great; in other countries, no one dares to lead such a great revolutionary movement. The cultural revolution will ensure that China never changes color."

Another friend from Bolivia said that during the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party of China can expose anti-party and anti-socialist elements, which shows that the Communist Party of China is a very powerful party and will never become revisionist like the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In China, there will not be a restoration of capitalism as in the Soviet Union. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution being carried out in China has world significance.

A female student from Peru said: "The Chinese Red Guards' actions of destroying the Four Olds and establishing the Four News are excellent. The Cultural Revolution in China is a great thing. This is not only a great event for the Chinese revolution but also a great event that promotes world revolution." Another Peruvian youth said: "China has become a political bastion of world revolution."

Felix Salcedo, a member of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Colombian Students, said that although the U.S. imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are currently trying to defame China's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards, the Colombian people believe that the purpose of the Cultural Revolution carried out in China is not only beneficial to the Chinese people but also serves as a guide for the struggles of the peoples of various countries. He said: "We Colombian revolutionaries completely believe that the manifestations of revisionism within Chinese society and the manifestations of bourgeois ideology will definitely be eliminated. Because China is carrying out the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people, when the U.S. imperialists launch an invasion, will be able to, like one person, thoroughly and completely bury the common enemy number one of the peoples of all countries."

A friend from Haiti said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is eliminating the remnants of the old world, and its significance lies in making a major contribution to how to prevent capitalist restoration in a socialist country.

African and Latin American students studying in Romania, after visiting an exhibition of pictures related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a great innovation and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    新华社讯　拉丁美洲各国人士继续发表谈话，热烈赞扬毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，热情称赞中国红卫兵的革命行动。
    玻利维亚一位学生说：“毛泽东是共产主义运动中文化革命的创始人。毛主席实在伟大，在别的国家就没有人敢领导这样伟大的革命运动。文化革命将保证中国永不变色。”
    玻利维亚另一位朋友说，在文化大革命中，中国共产党能把反党反社会主义分子揪出来，这说明中国共产党是一个很强大的党，永远不会像苏联共产党那样变成修正主义。在中国不会像苏联那样发生资本主义复辟。中国开展的无产阶级文化大革命具有世界意义。
    秘鲁一位女学生说：“中国红卫兵破四旧、立四新好得很。中国文化大革命是件大好事，这不仅是中国革命的大事，而且也是促进世界革命的大事。”另一位秘鲁青年说：“中国已经成了世界革命的政治堡垒”。
    哥伦比亚全国大学生联合会执行委员会委员费利克斯·萨尔塞多说，尽管目前美帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派力图诋毁中国的文化大革命和红卫兵，但是，哥伦比亚人民认为，中国开展的文化大革命的目的，不仅有利于中国人民，而且对世界各国人民的斗争是一个指南。他说：“我们哥伦比亚革命者完全相信，中国社会内部的修正主义表现和资产阶级意识形态的表现一定会消灭。由于中国开展文化革命，中国人民在一旦美帝国主义发动侵略的时候，就能够像一个人一样，彻底地、全部地埋葬各国人民共同的头号敌人。”
    海地的一位朋友说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命正在消除旧世界的残余，它的意义在于在一个社会主义国家如何防止资本主义复辟方面，作出了重大的贡献。（附图片）
