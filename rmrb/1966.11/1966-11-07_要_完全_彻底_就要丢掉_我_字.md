Mao Zedong said: Our army is completely dedicated to liberating the people and is thoroughly working for the people's interests.

To be "completely" and "thoroughly" dedicated, one must abandon the "I".

Yang Jichu (Member of Dengchong Production Brigade): To be completely and thoroughly dedicated to serving the people, one must completely discard the "I".

In the past, I had not studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and my mind was full of the "I." I saw chickens eating the collective's grain, and I did not bother to drive them away; if someone scolded my child a few words, I would quarrel with them.

After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I thought: serving the people must start from the smallest details. When the collective mill was drying grains outside, if chickens came, I would help drive them away; if it rained, I would help move the grains inside. My two daughters-in-law are young, and four grandchildren would hold them back from collective work, so I helped take care of the grandchildren. Two children were taking the cows out to graze, and I would urge them to go out early in the morning and return late in the afternoon. During plowing, the cows needed to be fed early in the morning, so I would get up at three in the morning to feed them. When the cows were full, it was daylight. The men and women of the brigade were all out working, and I stayed at home to take care of the children, helping them with more chores.

This summer, a member of the brigade, Liu Yunfa, had a three-year-old girl who fell into a pond. I quickly jumped into the pond, which was up to my neck, and rescued the girl. My aunt helped the girl breathe, and I helped change her clothes, saving the girl. Only then did I go change my own clothes. Someone asked me: "You can't swim, why did you dare jump into the pond?" I said: "I am a fifty-year-old person. It doesn't matter if I die. The children are the successors of the revolution and will do great things for the country in the future!"

Chen Jiaxiu (Member of Xinchong Production Brigade): Chairman Mao said: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." I am a poor peasant, so I must revolutionize. My husband said: "You are over fifty years old, can you still do revolutionary work?" I said: "Revolution does not distinguish between old and young."

To revolutionize, one must definitely study Chairman Mao's works. Some people say: "The characters are too big and black, and you can't recognize the small ones, how can you study?" I have ears to listen, right? I listen and then think, and then act according to Chairman Mao's words.

Others read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to me, and I understood. Chairman Mao wants us to be "completely" and "thoroughly" dedicated to serving the people. Chairman Mao pointed out a bright path, and I will walk on this path to the end.

Once, the brigade dried over two thousand jin of grain, and suddenly it started raining. Many members were not at home. I learned from Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, rushing to collect the collective's grain; I did not bother to collect my own dried quilt and dried radishes. By the time the members rushed back, I had already collected all the grain. The brigade had three young women whose children had no one to take care of, so I helped take care of the children, letting them go to collective work. Last winter, the health department sent malaria prevention medicine, and I went door to door to deliver it. Some people used the excuse of not having hot water and refused to take it, so I boiled the water, carrying a thermos in one hand and the medicine in the other, delivering it to them. The Watou Brigade had a woman who had menstrual problems, so I helped her call a doctor and accompanied her home. She cooked three eggs and a bowl of noodles, insisting that I eat. I said: "I am completely and thoroughly dedicated to serving the people, and I cannot eat." Recently, I met an old woman at Youzhai Station who was carrying her grandson to Hengyang for treatment. She could not carry him anymore, so I helped her carry him to the station. She pulled my clothes so hard that they were torn, insisting on giving me money for my trouble, but I refused. She kept thanking me, asking me where I was from and what my surname was. I told her: "You don't need to ask where I am from. You should thank Chairman Mao!" She said she was younger than me and in better health, so why didn't she have as much enthusiasm as me? I said: "You should study Chairman Mao's works. Once you study well, you will have more enthusiasm."

### 要“完全”“彻底”  就要丢掉“我”字

专栏：

    毛主席说：我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。
    要“完全”“彻底”  就要丢掉“我”字
    阳继祝（邓冲生产队社员）：要完全、彻底为人民服务，就要把“我”字丢干净。
    过去，我没有学《为人民服务》，心里尽是“我”字。看到鸡吃集体的谷，我不去管；谁要骂我小孩几句，我就和他吵翻天。
    学了《为人民服务》，我想：为人民服务要从一点一滴做起。集体磨坊在外面晒面，鸡来了，我就帮助赶开鸡；下雨了，我就帮着抬放在屋里。我的两个儿媳妇都年轻，四个小孙孙拖住她们不能出集体工，我就帮助她们带。两个小孩子放牛，我早上催他早些放，下午要他晚些关。在莳田的时候，天亮就要牛犁田，我早上三点钟就起来喂牛，牛吃饱了，天也亮了。队里男女劳力都出工去了，我在家里带小孩，帮助她们多操些心。
    今年夏季，社员刘运法一个三岁的女孩跌到塘里去了，我赶紧跳到齐颈深的水塘里，把女孩子抢救上来。我婶娘帮小孩呼吸，我就帮小孩换衣，把小孩救转来了，自己才去换衣服。有人问我：你不会游水，为什么敢下塘？我说：我是五十岁的老人了，死了不要紧。小孩子是革命的接班人，将来还要给国家办大事呢！
    陈家秀（新冲生产队社员）：毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”我是贫农，我就要革命。我男人说：“你五十多岁了，还能干革命？”我说：“革命还分什么老少？”
    要革命，一定要学习毛主席著作。有人说：“大字墨墨黑，小字你不认得，怎么学？”我有耳朵听嘛！听了就想，想了就按毛主席的话去做。
    别人给我读《为人民服务》，我听懂了。毛主席要我们“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。毛主席指出一条光明大路，我就要在这条路上走到底。
    有一次，队里晒了两千多斤谷，突然下起大雨来了，许多社员又都不在家。我就学习张思德、白求恩的精神，抢收集体的谷；自己晒的被子、干萝卜，我顾不得收。等到社员赶回来，我已经把两千多斤谷全部收拢了。队里三个青年妇女的小孩没人带，我就帮助她们带小孩，让她们出集体工。去年下雪天，卫生部门送来疟疾预防药，我就挨家挨户去送。有些人借口没有开水，不肯吃，我就烧好开水，一手提水壶，一手拿药丸，再给他们送去。水口大队有个妇女得了月经病，我就帮助请医生，陪送到她家里。她煮了三个蛋、一碗面，硬要我吃。我说：“我是完全、彻底为人民服务的，不能吃”。最近，我在油榨堡遇到一位老娘，背着孙子到衡阳去治病，她背不动了，我就帮助她背到车站。她把我衣角都拉烂了，硬要给我脚力钱，我不要。她口口声声感谢我，问我是那里人，姓什么？我告诉她：你不要问我那里人，你去感谢毛主席就对了！她说她年纪比我还轻，身体比我还好，为什么没有我这大的干劲？我说：“你去学习毛主席著作，学好了，干劲就大了。”
