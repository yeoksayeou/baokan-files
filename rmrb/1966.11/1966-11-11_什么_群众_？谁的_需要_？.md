	What is the "Masses"? Whose "Needs"?
		Shandong Ningjin Grain Bureau, Song Changsong

	Zhou Yang slanders that the Party "restricts writers too tightly, making them rigid and narrow." He shouts loudly: "In terms of themes and other aspects, we advocate diversity and encourage free creation, while opposing uniformity, rigidity, and narrowness." Writers should "decide on their themes based on their political sense of responsibility, their personal life experiences, interests, and strengths..."

	Once this black flag is raised, ghosts and monsters become as active as silkworms in the rainy season. Those bourgeois artists, with their "life experiences" of the landlord and bourgeoisie, dream of restoring the "paradise" of capitalism, and enjoy depicting emperors and generals, scholars and beauties. They "freely" describe the bourgeoisie and sing the praises of emperors and generals, "freely" spreading their poison. Zhou Yang's so-called "expanding themes" is to expand to emperors and generals, scholars and beauties, and to expand to the so-called "spiritual slavery wounds" of intermediate figures and the "dark sides" of the socialist system. In the eyes of Zhou Yang and his ilk, only by writing these things can it be called "diversity," only then can it "satisfy the masses' ever-growing, multifaceted spiritual needs." Whose "masses'" "needs"? It is the "needs" of you, this small clique of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and those in power who want to restore capitalism!

    什么“群众”？谁的“需要”？
        山东宁津粮食局　宋长松
    周扬诬蔑党对作家“限制得太死了，是刻板化和狭隘化”，声嘶力竭地叫嚷：在“题材等方面，我们提倡多样化，鼓励自由创造，而反对千篇一律、刻板和狭隘化。”作家要“根据自己的政治责任心、根据个人的生活经验、兴趣和特长来决定选取甚么题材……”
    这面黑旗一挥，牛鬼蛇神就像梅雨天的绵虫一样活跃起来。那些资产阶级文艺家，有的是地主资产阶级“生活经验”，幻想的是恢复资本主义的“天堂”，喜欢帝王将相，才子佳人，就在那里“自由”地描写资产阶级、歌颂帝王将相，“自由”地大放其毒了。周扬所谓“扩大题材”，就是要扩大到帝王将相、才子佳人那里去，“扩大”到所谓“精神奴役创伤”的中间人物和社会主义制度所谓的“阴暗面”那里去。在周扬这些家伙看来，只有写这些东西，才算“多样化”，“才能满足群众不断增长的、多方面的精神需要。”什么“群众”的“需要”？就是你们这一小撮地富反坏右和走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的“需要”！
