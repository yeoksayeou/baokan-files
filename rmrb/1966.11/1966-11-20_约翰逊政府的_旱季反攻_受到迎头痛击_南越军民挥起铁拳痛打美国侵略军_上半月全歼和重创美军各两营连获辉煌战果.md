The brave and skilled military and civilians of South Vietnam launched attacks in various locations in the first half of November, inflicting heavy losses on the U.S. aggressors and achieving new, brilliant victories.

According to a communiqué released by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, in battles in areas such as Xining, Saigon, Gia Dinh, Tân An, Bến Tre, Đồng Tâm, Vĩnh Long, Bình Định, and Kon Tum, the Vietnam South Liberation Armed Forces alone annihilated over 3,000 enemy troops (mostly U.S. aggressors), including the complete annihilation of two U.S. Army battalions, one puppet battalion, and six companies, and severely damaged two U.S. Army battalions and eight puppet companies. They also shot down, damaged, and destroyed over 40 enemy aircraft.

The communiqué said that following the successful shelling of the so-called "national day" parade held by the U.S.-puppet clique in the center of Saigon on November 1, on November 3, the liberation forces bravely struck the enemy in Xining Province, annihilating approximately 1,600 enemy troops, mostly U.S. aggressors. On November 4, the liberation forces again bravely struck three battalions of U.S. troops in the Ba Giong area of Xining Province, completely annihilating one battalion and routing two battalions, severely damaging several companies.

The communiqué said that at the same time, U.S. aggressors in other regions also suffered attacks from the military and civilians of South Vietnam. The U.S. 4th Infantry Division was routed in the Bo La Giang area of Kon Tum Province. The U.S. 1st Cavalry Division was severely beaten in the Phu My area of Bình Định Province, suffering heavy casualties. The U.S. Marine Corps was consecutively annihilated in Da Nang and Quảng Trị Province. The U.S. 173rd and 101st Airborne Divisions were consecutively struck in Xining and Phú Yên Province, leaving them disoriented.

The communiqué said that during this period, guerrilla forces and local troops in various parts of South Vietnam actively cooperated with the main forces, frequently striking the enemy on various water and land transportation lines in the enemy's rear, annihilating many U.S.-puppet troops.

The communiqué concluded by saying that in just the first 15 days of this month, the enemy suffered such heavy losses. It is believed that in the future, the Vietnamese military and civilians will annihilate even more U.S. aggressors.

		Hanoi, November 18 - The Vietnam People's Army newspaper published an editorial on November 18, enthusiastically hailing the brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam in the first half of November.

		In this half-month, they completely annihilated and severely damaged five battalions and 14 companies of U.S.-puppet troops, killing and wounding over 3,000 enemy troops, and shooting down, destroying, and damaging over 40 enemy aircraft.

		The editorial pointed out that the victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam in the first half of November this year foreshadow the heavy defeat of the Johnson administration's second "dry season strategic counteroffensive plan."

		The editorial said that the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, with over 400,000 U.S. troops and mercenaries and about 500,000 puppet troops, are recklessly beginning to execute their dry season plan. However, the military and civilians of South Vietnam, with their recent brilliant victories, have given their dry season plan a heavy blow. In the Xining battlefield alone, the U.S. aggressors are about to throw almost all their mobile forces in the southern eastern region into the battle, including the 1st Infantry Division, the 25th Infantry Division, the 196th Infantry Brigade, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, totaling 30,000 troops. But they are all facing the predicament of being mired in the quagmire. There, several battalions and companies of U.S. troops have already been annihilated.

		The editorial said that the military and civilians of South Vietnam are vigorously displaying the power of people's war, broadly and continuously striking the enemy, pushing the competition of killing the enemy and achieving merit to a new high.

    约翰逊政府的“旱季反攻”受到迎头痛击
    南越军民挥起铁拳痛打美国侵略军
    上半月全歼和重创美军各两营连获辉煌战果
    新华社河内十八日电　英勇善战的越南南方军民，十一月上半月四处出击，痛打美国侵略军，取得了新的辉煌胜利。
    据越南南方解放通讯社发表的公报说，越南南方解放武装力量仅在西宁、西贡、嘉定、新安、堤岸、同塔梅、永隆、平定、昆嵩等战役中，就歼灭敌人三千多名（大部分是美国侵略军），其中包括全歼美军两个营、伪军一个营和六个连，重创美军两个营和伪军八个连，击落、击伤和摧毁敌机四十多架。
    公报说，越南南方解放武装力量继十一月一日成功地炮轰美伪集团在西贡市中心举行的所谓
  “国庆”阅兵式以后，三日，在西宁省又英勇打击敌人，共歼敌约一千六百名，其中大部分是美国侵略军。四日，解放武装力量又在西宁省保贡痛击三个营美军，全歼其中一个营，击溃两个营和重创好几个连。
    公报说，与此同时，美国侵略军在其他地区也都遭到了越南南方军民的打击。美国第四步兵师在昆嵩省波来吉浪地区被打得落花流水。美国第一骑兵师在平定省符美地区挨了揍，伤亡惨重。美国海军陆战队在岘港、广治省接连被歼。美国第一七三和第一零一空降旅在西宁和富安省也接连被打得晕头转向。
    公报说，在这期间越南南方各地游击队和地方部队也积极配合主力部队的进攻，频频出击，在敌人后方各条水陆交通线上，打击敌人，又消灭许多美伪军。
    公报最后说，仅仅在这个月头十五天内，敌人就遭到如此惨重损失，相信在今后越南军民将会歼灭更多的美国侵略强盗。
    新华社河内十八日电　越南《人民报》十八日发表社论，热烈欢呼越南南方军民十一月份上半月取得的辉煌战果。
    在这半个月中，他们全歼和严重杀伤美伪军五个营和十四个连，打死打伤敌人三千多名，击落、击毁和击伤敌机四十多架。
    社论指出，越南南方军民今年十一月份上半月的胜利，预示着约翰逊集团第二个“旱季战略反攻计划”的惨重失败。
    社论说，美国强盗及其走狗用四十多万美军和帮凶军以及五十万左右的伪军，正在冒险地开始执行他们的旱季计划。但是南方军民以最近取得的辉煌战果，给予他们的旱季计划以迎头痛击。仅在西宁战场上，美国强盗就要把他们在南部东区的几乎全部机动力量投进去，包括第一步兵师、第二十五步兵师、一九六步兵旅和一七三空降旅的侵略军，共三万名。但他们已全部面临深陷泥潭的困境。在那里，已有好几个营和好几个连美军被歼灭。
    社论说，南越军民正在大力发挥人民战争的威力，广泛和连续地打击敌人，把杀敌立功竞赛推向高潮。
