	New Forces Games Asian Committee Acting Chairman Huang Zhong held a reception tonight here to celebrate the opening of the first plenary session of the New Forces Games Asian Committee and the imminent victory of the first Asian New Forces Games in Phnom Penh.

	Cambodia's Chairman of the National Organizing Committee for the First Asian New Forces Games, Dipan, Cambodia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Norodom Phurissara, and representatives from various countries attending the first plenary session of the New Forces Games Asian Committee, as well as the heads and deputy heads of the sports delegations participating in the first Asian New Forces Games, attended the reception. Chairman of the New Forces Games Federation, Maladi, was also invited to attend the reception.

	At the enthusiastic reception, Huang Zhong and Dipan both spoke.

	Huang Zhong pointed out in his speech that since the establishment of the New Forces Games Asian Committee, the New Forces Games movement has developed more broadly and deeply in the Asian region. The current first plenary session of the New Forces Games Asian Committee and the first Asian New Forces Games, which will open tomorrow, mark the vigorous development of the New Forces Games movement.

	Huang Zhong once again expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Cambodian government and people for their hard work and effective efforts under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk to ensure the success of the first Asian New Forces Games.

	Huang Zhong said, "The peoples of Asia share the same destiny and breathe the same air. In the common struggle against imperialism led by the United States and for the independent development of sports, we need to unite, support each other, and help each other. United people are a true iron wall that no force can break. The American imperialists and their followers, despite their various tricks, have attempted to sabotage the Asian New Forces Games, but their plots have met with shameful failure."

	Huang Zhong concluded, "On our path forward, we will encounter various twists and turns. However, the overall trend of the collapse of imperialism is something that no force can change."

	Dipan said in his speech that the first Asian New Forces Games are for our common interests, and we should unite to eliminate the injustices imposed on us by imperialism. Dipan wished the first Asian New Forces Games a complete victory.

	China's Ambassador to Cambodia, Chen Shuliang, and diplomatic staff from the embassy also attended the reception.

	After the reception, the Chinese Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe, which is visiting Cambodia, performed a wonderful show for the guests. Their performance was enthusiastically received. (Accompanying photo)

    黄中在祝贺新运会亚委会大会和亚新会开幕的招待会上说
    团结起来的人民是真正的铜墙铁壁
    美帝及其追随者企图破坏亚新会的阴谋已遭可耻失败
    新华社金边二十四日电　新兴力量运动会亚洲委员会代理主席黄中今晚在这里举行招待会，祝贺新兴力量运动会亚洲委员会第一届全体大会的召开和第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会即将在金边胜利开幕。
    柬埔寨第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会全国组织委员会主席狄潘、柬埔寨外交大臣富里萨拉亲王和出席新兴力量运动会亚洲委员会第一届全体大会的各国代表以及参加第一届亚洲新运会的各国体育代表团正副团长，出席了招待会。新兴力量运动会联合会主席马拉迪也应邀出席了招待会。
    在热情洋溢的招待会上，黄中和狄潘先后讲了话。
    黄中在讲话中指出，自从新运会亚洲委员会成立以来，新运会的事业在亚洲地区有了更广泛、更深入的发展。目前正在进行的新运会亚洲委员会第一次全体大会和明天即将开幕的第一届亚洲新运会，标志着新运会事业的蓬勃发展。
    黄中对柬埔寨政府和人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，为第一届亚洲新运会的成功所进行的辛勤的、卓有成效的工作，再一次表示衷心感谢。
    黄中说，“亚洲人民同命运，共呼吸，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、独立自主发展体育运动的共同斗争中，需要团结起来，互相支持，互相帮助。团结起来的人民，是真正的铜墙铁壁，是什么力量也打不破的。美帝国主义及其追随者尽管施尽各种伎俩，企图破坏亚洲新运会，但是他们的阴谋已遭到可耻的失败。”
    黄中最后说：“在我们前进的道路上，还会遇到各种曲折。但是帝国主义全面崩溃的总趋势是任何力量都改变不了的。”
    狄潘在讲话中说，第一届亚洲新运会是为了我们共同的利益的，让我们团结一致，清除帝国主义强加在我们身上的非正义的东西。狄潘祝第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会取得完全胜利。
