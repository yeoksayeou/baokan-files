The song "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" is a well-known military song in China. It was created during the Long March in 1935 and has since become an integral part of the Chinese military's training and discipline. The lyrics emphasize the importance of discipline, respect, and proper conduct among soldiers.

The "Three Rules of Discipline" are:
1. Obey orders in all your actions.
2. Do not take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses.
3. Turn in everything captured.

The "Eight Points for Attention" are:
1. Speak politely.
2. Pay fairly for what you buy.
3. Return everything you borrow.
4. Pay for anything you damage.
5. Do not hit or swear at people.
6. Do not damage crops.
7. Do not take liberties with women.
8. Do not ill-treat captives.

These rules and points of attention were established to ensure that the soldiers of the Chinese Communist Party maintained high standards of conduct and discipline, both in times of peace and war. The song serves as a reminder of these principles and has been passed down through generations of soldiers.
