A Soviet youth wrote to Chairman Mao, saying: "You are the Lenin of our time. Only your thoughts can save my country. I do not want to be a victim of modern revisionism, but I want to be a true revolutionary."

According to a Nov. 9th report by Xinhua News Agency, Hu Debao, the representative of all Chinese students who were ordered to return to China by the Soviet government, read a letter from a Soviet youth to Chairman Mao at a welcoming rally held by revolutionary masses in the capital on Nov. 5th. The full text of the letter is as follows:

"Dear Chairman Mao:

You are the person closest to my heart in this world. You are the Lenin of our time.

I was born after the Second World War. The formation of my worldview coincided with the period when revisionism dominated my country. Therefore, I once admired the American way of life, liked American clothing, music, and publications. In 1962, I began to listen to Beijing Radio. I must admit that when I first started listening to your broadcasts, I did so with a bit of mockery. Later, moved by the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, I began to listen to your broadcasts frequently. After 1963, I completely stood on your side in opposing imperialism and modern revisionism. I believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the true Marxism-Leninism of our time. Only your thoughts can save my country. I am willing to arm myself with your thoughts and transform my consciousness. To raise my revolutionary awareness, I hope to have the opportunity, even if it is for a short time, to work and live in your factories and people's communes with Chinese workers and peasants. I hope to become a true revolutionary. How I wish my awareness could be like that of the Chinese people!

Since the start of your Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the distorted reports in my country's press, I initially had some doubts about your Cultural Revolution. However, because of my love for you and my respect for your works, I returned to the correct path. And those who walk this path in the Soviet Union are not just me alone.

I want to be your soldier. I swear to fight to the end against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU! I swear to fight for the realization of your thoughts in my country, sparing no effort, even my life! I swear to fight for the revival of true Marxism-Leninism in my country! I firmly believe that your thoughts will definitely become the guiding principles for all work in my country. In the future, people all over the world will see the true flag of Marxism-Leninism—your thoughts—flying over the Kremlin!

Long live Mao Zedong Thought!

I do not want to be a victim of modern revisionism, but I want to be a true revolutionary!"

    一位苏联青年写信给毛主席说：您是当代的列宁
    “只有您的思想，才能拯救我的祖国”
    “我不愿做现代修正主义的牺牲品，而要做一名真正的革命者”
    据新华社九日讯　被苏联政府无理勒令回国的我全体留苏学生的代表胡德宝，五日在首都革命群众举行的欢迎大会上宣读了一位苏联青年写给毛主席的一封信。这封信的全文如下：
  “亲爱的毛泽东同
  志：
    您是我世界上最亲近的人。您是当代的列宁。
    我是第二次世界大战后出生的。我的人生观的形成，和修正主义在我国的统治是同时期的。因此，我曾经崇拜过美国的生活方式，喜爱过美国的服装、美国的音乐和美国的书刊。一九六二年，我开始收听北京广播。应该承认，在开始听你们的广播时，我是带有一些嘲笑的态度的。以后，由于中国人民的革命精神对我的感动，于是我经常不断地收听你们的广播。一九六三年以后，我完全站到你们反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的一边。我认为，毛泽东思想是当代真正的马克思列宁主义。只有您的思想，才能够拯救我的祖国。我愿意用您的思想把自己武装起来，改造我的思想意识。为了提高我的革命觉悟，我希望有机会，即令时间不长，到你们国家的工厂和人民公社，同中国工人和农民一起工作和生活一个时期。我希望自己能成为一个真正的革命者。我多么希望我的觉悟能像中国人民那样啊！
    自从你们的文化大革命开始以后，由于我国报刊的歪曲报道，使我在开始时对于你们的文化大革命也有些怀疑。但是，由于我对您的热爱和对您的著作的敬仰，使我又回到了正确的道路上来。而走这一条路的，在苏联决不只是我一个人。
    我想成为您的战士。我宣誓为反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义而奋斗到底！我宣誓为您的思想在我国的实现而奋斗，不惜一切力量，甚至生命！我宣誓为真正的马克思列宁主义在我国复兴而奋斗！我坚信您的思想一定会成为我国各项工作的指针。将来，全世界人民一定会看到，在克里姆林宫的上空升起真正的马克思列宁主义——您的思想的旗帜！
    毛泽东思想万岁！
    我不愿做现代修正主义的牺牲品，而要做一名真正的革命者！”
