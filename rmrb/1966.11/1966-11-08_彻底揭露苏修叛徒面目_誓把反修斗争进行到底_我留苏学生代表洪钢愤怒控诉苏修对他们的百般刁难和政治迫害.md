The representative of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, Hong Gang, on the 5th at a welcoming rally held by revolutionary masses in the capital, delivered a speech, angrily denouncing the various unreasonable difficulties and political persecutions imposed by the Soviet revisionist leadership on them. The following is a summary of her speech:

We have returned from the Soviet Union, where the Soviet revisionist leadership is in power, to the capital of our great motherland, to the side of Chairman Mao. Everyone feels an endless warmth in their hearts. Today, as we stand by Chairman Mao and in front of our compatriots, recalling the various cold shoulders, difficulties, and persecutions we endured in the Soviet Union, we are even more indignant and outraged at the series of serious crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the cause of the proletarian revolution. We must thoroughly expose the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership and resolutely carry forward the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party.

Just a few days ago, when we were still living on the soil of the Soviet Union under the rule of the modern revisionist leadership, a small group of revisionists, seeing that we were about to depart for our homeland, maliciously told us: "Once you set foot on Chinese soil, you will be arrested by the Red Guards, and you may not even make it home, you might be beaten to death by the Red Guards." This is truly despicable and laughable. They attempted to use these clumsy lies to shake our unyielding love for our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, our great Party, our great motherland, and our people. This is sheer delusion! They should open their eyes and see who they are dealing with? Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought will not be shaken by a few vile lies!

The savage action of the Soviet government in arbitrarily ordering the return of all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union was long planned. The Soviet revisionist leadership has long been racking their brains, creating various excuses, and using every possible means to reduce the number of Chinese students. For the few who have been accepted, they have been subjected to endless difficulties and persecutions, from studies, living conditions, to politics, creating various restrictions and persecutions.

According to the cultural cooperation agreement between China and the Soviet Union, our motherland sent us to study in the Soviet Union. However, the treatment we received there was extremely outrageous. The Soviet revisionist leadership has always sabotaged the cultural agreement between the two countries. They either deliberately delayed and did not arrange for our studies for a long time, or unilaterally and arbitrarily changed the majors of Chinese students. They did not guarantee, did not provide, or only provided extremely poor study conditions for Chinese students. Moreover, they often created various excuses to arbitrarily shorten the study period of Chinese students, even forcing some Chinese students to drop out midway and return to the country. They truly went to great lengths, stopping at nothing.

Last August, Hu Debao, a graduate student studying in the Soviet Union, was deliberately delayed by the Soviet side and not provided with the conditions to study his major. Until this time when he was forced to return to the country, fourteen months had passed, and he still had not been able to start his major studies. A foreign friend was very outraged at the Soviet authorities' actions and said to Hu Debao before he left Moscow: "Your studies have not even begun, and they are already over!"

Zhang Hongbin, who went to study at Moscow University last year, had his major in isotope analysis and separation technology approved by the Soviet side. However, when he arrived in Moscow to handle the procedures, the Soviet side changed their mind, using the excuse that Moscow University did not have this major and refused to arrange it. When we students told the Soviet authorities that Moscow University not only had this major but had also found the person in charge of this major, and this person was also willing to accept Chinese students, the Soviet side created new excuses, saying that this person in charge of the major would soon go abroad and still did not arrange it. More than a year passed, and this person in charge did not go abroad. Under the Soviet side's difficulties, Zhang Hongbin had to change his original major. There were many such incidents.

Last year, most of the students who went to study in the Soviet Union were assigned by the Soviet side to cities and schools with extremely poor study conditions. These places not only lacked study equipment but also most of them had never accepted foreign graduate students before, and the teaching conditions and experience were very poor. The Soviet side not only did not provide the necessary study conditions for Chinese students but also created difficulties in every possible way. They were afraid that Chinese students would propagate Mao Zedong Thought in the revisionist center of Moscow and deliberately assigned twenty-five advanced students studying Russian to the remote Siberian region of Irkutsk. Chinese advanced students in Irkutsk not only did not get the necessary equipment to learn the language but even the most basic condition for learning, that is, the classroom for classes, could not be guaranteed. Chinese students had to spend an hour to find a place for a two-hour class. Chinese graduate students sent to Voronezh University sometimes could not even get the most common and necessary chemical reagents when doing experiments. A graduate student studying soil had to use beer bottles to replace the shaking bottles needed for the experiment. In arranging the time for experiments, the Soviet authorities also did not miss the opportunity to create difficulties. They deliberately arranged for a graduate student to use a computer at three or four in the morning. Some laboratories, the Soviet side opened the door wide for Americans, allowing them to freely visit, but when one of our graduate students requested to visit for study purposes, they were flatly rejected by the Soviet side. Graduate student Zhou Xuofan has been in the Soviet Union for two years, and the Soviet side still has not finally confirmed her research topic. Some disciplines require internships, and the Soviet side has arranged internships for domestic and other foreign students, but they did not arrange internships for Chinese graduate students at all. For most undergraduate students, they did not arrange internships, and for the few who did, they did not get the internship conditions they deserved.

Two Chinese undergraduate students studying at the Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology in Moscow were supposed to intern for half a year in a factory according to the study plan, but the Soviet side only gave them two months to go to the Voronezh Automation Research Institute for "internship." When they arrived, the Soviet side did not allow Chinese students to intern in the attached factory but only allowed them to read books in the designated room. These books that Chinese students did not need to come to "intern" could be read. The summary articles of their own units that the Soviet side gave to Chinese students were all outdated and valueless things. Two months of time was about to pass, and Chinese students repeatedly asked the Soviet side, and the Soviet side had to take Chinese students to the factory for a visit in the last two days, with a total of one hour in the factory. While the Soviet students in the same class all got half a year of internship and graduated on time.

Chinese students studying at the Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology were supposed to study for six years according to the regulations, but to limit the study of Chinese students, the Soviet side arbitrarily changed their study period to five years.

When the Soviet side could not achieve certain unspoken political purposes, they often used "poor performance" as an excuse to force our students to drop out and return to the country. We had a student who went to Leningrad as a graduate student in 1963. The Soviet authorities knew he was the person in charge of our students and deliberately tried to pull him down. They actually instructed a Soviet person to propose to our student to introduce a female experimenter from their laboratory to him, which was immediately rejected by our student. The other party shamelessly said: "You don't have to take her back, just play with her here!" Our student then severely rebuked them. After the Soviet authorities' despicable plot failed, they became angry and began to pick on our student's studies. During the professional exam, they deliberately made the questions very long. Our student, not hearing clearly, asked to repeat it, and they said our student could not answer, arbitrarily giving a "fail" grade. During the makeup exam, they deliberately created difficulties, and then, using "poor studies" as an excuse, ordered him to drop out.

We Chinese students, under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, have always loved labor, been thrifty and simple, and never cared about living conditions and personal gains and losses. However, the discrimination and persecution of the Soviet revisionist leadership in living arrangements towards Chinese students made us indignant. Last year, a Chinese student was placed in a very bad earthen house after arriving in the Soviet Union. When they heard that someone from the Chinese Embassy was going to visit their students, they hastily moved this Chinese student to a hotel. At Voronezh University, all foreign students lived in new buildings, but only three Chinese students lived in the corner of the fourth floor of an old building. This building, due to long-term disrepair, had snow melting from the roof, causing water to leak into the room, resulting in a water disaster for our students' beds, boxes, and books. What was even more intolerable was the experience of two Chinese students, Uighur students from Xinjiang, Mu Ming and Mansuli, in Tashkent, Soviet Union. After the first earthquake in Tashkent, all foreign students and Soviet students living with our Chinese students were moved to safe places, but only Chinese students were not moved. The Soviet leadership shamelessly said: "You are already fifth-year students. The others are only first-year students, it's a pity if they die." After four protests by Chinese students, they were allowed to move after a month.

The new Soviet leadership has always regarded Chinese students as a thorn in their side and a bone in their throat, hating them to the core, and subjected them to various cruel, fascist-style political persecutions. They often sent spies to monitor our actions, eavesdrop on our conversations, secretly record our conversations, and secretly look at our books and study materials. They prohibited Chinese students from receiving visitors, prohibited Soviet people, including overseas Chinese, from contacting Chinese students, instructed hooligans to obstruct Chinese students from listening to Beijing broadcasts, and arbitrarily detained Chinese students' subscriptions to the domestic "People's Daily." Some students subscribed to a year's "People's Daily," but in total, they received less than a month's worth. Our students refuted the anti-China reports organized by the Soviet revisionist leadership, and the Soviet authorities then slandered that Chinese students did not abide by the law, threatening them with imprisonment and expulsion. The Soviet authorities used violence against Chinese students under various pretexts, and even harmed Chinese students' lives, which happened continuously. On March 4 last year, Chinese students participating in the anti-American, pro-Vietnam demonstration by foreign students studying in the Soviet Union were brutally suppressed by the Soviet authorities, and blood was shed on the streets of Moscow. The Soviet authorities also instructed spies to pour mercury into the food of Chinese students, throw cigarette butts and matchboxes. When our students were sleeping deeply at night, they were brutally beaten by Soviet thugs. Despite our repeated requests to the Soviet authorities to guarantee the safety of our students, this persecution of Chinese students did not decrease but became even more rampant.

On October 10 this year, an anti-China report meeting was held at Leningrad University. A group of spies and hooligans jumped onto the stage during the meeting and forcibly separated three of our students who demanded to speak, surrounding them layer by layer. A hooligan first punched Wong Shiyou twice, then four people held his arms, trying to lock him in the backstage dressing room. The other two Chinese students also suffered similar violence. However, Chinese students fearlessly insisted on reasoning and fighting. After the meeting, the Soviet revisionist authorities instructed a group of spy hooligans to follow our students for two hours. A thug took advantage of the opportunity to snatch the camera from our student's hand. Our student immediately fought with this thug, and the thug, in a panic, fell to the ground. Our student took the opportunity to snatch back the camera. At that time, a Soviet police officer came, and our student reported the hooligan behavior of the Soviet thug to him. However, this person did not take any action against these hooligans but instead unreasonably demanded that our student go to the police station. This unreasonable demand was immediately rejected by our student.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is extremely afraid of truth, afraid of the masses, and afraid of the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in the Soviet Union. On October 1, to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the People's Republic of China, and to introduce to Soviet teachers and students the great socialist revolution and socialist construction achievements of China, according to custom, Chinese students applied to the leadership of their units to hold a small-scale photo exhibition. Due to their fear of truth, fear of Mao Zedong Thought, and fear of Soviet people knowing the real situation of China, the leadership of most units refused our students' reasonable request. The leadership of the Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology said that as long as Chinese students exhibit pictures, they would be immediately expelled within twenty-four hours. However, the pictures exhibited after repeated efforts by some unit leadership were torn down by hooligans after being exhibited for only half an hour. The photo exhibition held by Chinese students at Kiev Medical University was torn down by the party committee head and hooligans as soon as it was exhibited. Chinese students studying in Irkutsk, after being approved by the school to exhibit photos in the dormitory, were very popular with the masses. But the school leadership, fearing the development of Sino-Soviet friendship, suddenly changed their minds, fabricated rumors that Chinese students were holding an anti-Soviet exhibition, and incited a large number of Soviet students to provoke Chinese students, attempting to forcibly seize the exhibition board. When Soviet students saw that our exhibited photos had no anti-Soviet content and after our students explained the facts, most Soviet students sympathized with us, thinking that the school leadership's ban on the exhibition was unreasonable. Their plot failed, and they came up with new tricks. Some school leadership had a "talk" with us and openly proposed to prohibit our students from writing "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" on the exhibition board and threatened our students, saying that if this slogan was not removed, they would instruct thugs to tear down the photos and expel all Chinese students studying in Irkutsk. Their unreasonable demand was immediately refuted by our students. The photos exhibited at the Soviet Academy of Sciences were also approved by the academy before being exhibited, but after being exhibited, the academy chairman led armed police to forcibly tear down the photos. When Chinese students asked why Americans were allowed to hold exhibitions in Moscow but not Chinese people, the other side replied: "Because the Americans do not oppose us." This is the Soviet revisionist's self-incriminating statement of colluding with the Americans and opposing China. Our students were extremely angry at these savage acts of destroying Sino-Soviet friendship and insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, on the one hand, conducted a serious reasoning struggle with the relevant authorities, and on the other hand, lodged the strongest protest. However, the person in charge of Moscow Geological Institute tried to argue, saying: "Think about it, your photos are different from what is said in our newspapers. If they cause confusion among our students, what should we do?"

To achieve their despicable political purposes, the Soviet revisionist leadership also tried to use sugar-coated bullets to defeat Chinese students armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They often instructed their party members to propagate bourgeois ideology and lifestyle to us, hoping to use things like doctoral degrees and high salaries as material incentives to induce Chinese students to peacefully evolve. After being severely refuted by Chinese students, they then resorted to the money and women tactic, shamelessly saying to Chinese students: "If money is not enough or if you want to send it back home, we can provide help." The person in charge of education in the Irkutsk Provincial Committee openly said, "Stay in the Soviet Union, find a Soviet girl, and settle down here!" Their intentions were truly despicable and shameless to the extreme.

Even more infuriating was that when the Soviet government unilaterally tore up the cultural agreement between the two countries and ordered our students to suspend their studies and return to the country within a limited time, they instructed some Communist Party members to openly engage in subversion activities towards Chinese students. In Irkutsk, the Soviet authorities had instructed a Communist Party member to repeatedly "talk" to our students separately, attempting to force our students studying in the Soviet Union to betray their own country. He shamelessly said: "Terrible things are happening in your country. If I were you, I would seek political asylum and stay in the Soviet Union and not go back." He said, "If you seek political asylum, you just need to sign your name on a piece of paper." The Soviet revisionists were truly blind, making one feel both angry and ridiculous. When our students asked who sent him, he admitted: "This is not my personal opinion, this is what we discussed." We immediately lodged the most serious protest with the Soviet side. In the face of facts, their principal had to admit their mistake.

When the "smile" of the Soviet revisionists could no longer be maintained, they revealed their fascist thug faces. The revisionist leadership in Tashkent deliberately hid the decision of the Soviet government to arbitrarily order our students to return to the country and attempted to secretly detain the Chinese student Mu Ming. When Mu Ming received the notice from our embassy to leave Tashkent and go to Moscow, the Soviet side actually sent police and thugs to forcibly seize Mu Ming's suitcase and injured his arm. When they could not achieve their goals with force, they used the excuse of excessive luggage to prevent Mu Ming from boarding the train. Due to Mu Ming's brave struggle and the help of African revolutionary students, the revisionist plot finally failed.

The revolutionary spirit and excellent ideological style of Chinese students have left a deep impression on the broad masses of the Soviet people and have been highly praised. Many Soviet students and people said to us: "It is Comrade Mao Zedong who has cultivated you so well." Some said: "We have heard a lot of bad things about your country here, but after we have had a few contacts with you, we know they are lying. If China were really so bad, how could there be such good people as you?" A teacher said: "I have taught for more than ten years and have never taught such good students as you. I would like to study with you and teach you to the end, but I have no way. If you encounter any difficulties in your studies after you return, please write to me, and I will definitely answer you."

The Soviet revisionist leadership is extremely afraid of revolution, afraid of the people, and afraid of the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in the Soviet Union. They thought that by expelling Chinese students, they could rest easy. However, things always develop in the opposite direction of what the revisionists imagined. Our greatest teacher, Chairman Mao, said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." This is exactly the case. A Soviet worker said to us: "Expelling you is unreasonable. What they (referring to the Soviet leadership) are doing is the same as what Khrushchev did, cursing you every day in the newspapers, but I think they are lying." Another Soviet youth said: "Go back, go back and walk the path you think is correct. You will definitely achieve your goals and win, while we in the Soviet Union are now lost."

Many Soviet people have now seen through the true nature of the new Soviet leadership, recognized that they are unadulterated Khrushchev revisionists, and have gone even further than Khrushchev. We deeply feel that the Soviet people will always stand with us. They expressed great anger at the Soviet revisionist leadership's deliberate sabotage of Sino-Soviet relations, sabotage of Sino-Soviet friendship, and the various bad things they did to Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union. When we said goodbye to them this time, some people had tears in their eyes expressing their reluctance to part. Someone said to us: "Remember, the Soviet people are friendly to you, these are just the bad things done by some leaders above." Another said: "These new leaders (referring to the Soviet leadership) have not done a single good thing in Sino-Soviet relations. As a Soviet person and an ordinary communist, I am also ashamed of their foolish actions. But we Soviet people want to be friendly with China." This is the attitude of the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist leadership has done nothing but evil, and their days will not be long. The day when the Soviet people rise up to overthrow revisionism is coming!

    彻底揭露苏修叛徒面目  誓把反修斗争进行到底
    我留苏学生代表洪钢愤怒控诉苏修对他们的百般刁难和政治迫害
    新华社七日讯　被苏联政府无理勒令回国的我全体留苏学生的代表洪钢，五日在首都革命群众举行的欢迎大会上发表讲话，愤怒地控诉了苏联修正主义领导集团对他们进行的种种无理刁难和政治迫害。她的讲话摘要如下：
    我们从苏共修正主义领导集团当权的苏联，回到了伟大祖国的首都，回到了毛主席身边，人人心里感到无限温暖。今天，当我们在毛主席身边和祖国亲人面前，回想起在苏联遭到的种种冷遇、刁难和迫害时，我们对于苏联修正主义领导集团一系列背叛无产阶级革命事业的严重罪行，更加义愤填膺，无比愤慨。我们一定要彻底揭露苏联修正主义领导集团的叛徒面目，一定要把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    几天以前，当我们还生活在现代修正主义领导集团当权的苏联国土上的时候，一小撮修正主义分子看到我们就要动身返回祖国，便阴险地对我们说：“你们这些人一踏上中国国土，就会被红卫兵抓起来，也许根本到不了家，就被红卫兵打死了。”这真是卑鄙无耻，可笑之极。他们企图用这些拙笨的谎言，来动摇我们对最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，对我们伟大的党，对我们伟大祖国和人民的无限热爱，这真是痴心妄想！他们也不睁开眼睛看看，在他们面前的是些什么人？用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年，岂能被几句卑劣的谎言所动摇？！
    苏修领导集团赶走我留学生的野蛮行动蓄谋已久，长期以来，对我留学生进行无理刁难和迫害
    苏联政府无理赶走中国全体留学生的野蛮行动是蓄谋已久的。苏联修正主义领导集团早就挖空心思，制造种种借口，想方设法地极力减少我留学生的人数。对已经被接受的少量留学生，长期以来更是百般刁难，从学习上、生活上直到政治上，制造种种限制和迫害。
    根据中苏两国文化合作协定，祖国派我们到苏联去学习，可是我们在苏联受到的待遇是非常令人愤慨的。苏联修正主义领导集团一贯破坏两国文化协定。他们对中国留学生不是有意拖延，长期不安排我们的学习，就是违反协定，单方面擅自改变我留学生所学的专业。他们一贯不保证、不提供、或者只提供一些极差的学习条件给中国学生，而且还经常制造各种借口，任意缩短中国留学生的学习年限，甚至无理迫使我留学生中途退学回国。真是煞费心思，无所不用其极。
    去年八月，在苏学习的研究生胡德宝同学，由于苏方有意拖延，不给安排专业学习条件，直到这次被赶回国，历时十四个月之久，一直没能进行专业学习。一位外国朋友对苏联当局的这种作法感到非常愤慨，在胡德宝临离开莫斯科前，这位外国朋友对他说：“你的学习还没有开始，就已经结束了！”
    去年到莫斯科大学学习的张宏斌同学，他所学的专业是同位素分析技术和分离技术，苏方同意接受。但是，当他来到莫斯科办理手续时，苏方却改变了主意，借口莫斯科大学没有这个专业，不予安排。当我们同学告诉苏联当局，莫斯科大学不仅有这个专业，而且找到了这个专业的负责人，并且这位负责人也表示愿意接受中国留学生时，苏方又制造新的借口，说这位专业负责人很快就要出国，仍然不给安排。一年多的时间过去了，这位负责人并没有出国。在苏方的刁难下，张宏斌同学不得不改变原报专业。像这样的事情是很多的。
    去年我国到苏联学习的同学中，绝大部分人都被苏方分配到学习条件极差的城市和学校。这些地方不仅缺乏学习设备，而且大部分过去从来没有接受过外国研究生，师资条件和教学经验都很差。苏方不但不给中国学生提供必要的学习条件，而且还千方百计地在学习上制造困难。他们害怕中国留学生在修正主义的中心莫斯科宣传毛泽东思想，有意将二十五名学习俄语的进修生分配到边远的西伯利亚地区伊尔库茨克。中国进修生在伊尔库茨克非但没有得到学习语言的必要的设备保证，甚至连学习的最起码的条件，即上课用的教室也得不到保证。中国同学为了找地方上两小时的课，就要花费掉一个小时。被派到沃龙涅什大学去的中国研究生，有时作实验时，连最需要而又最普通的化学试剂也得不到。有一个研究土壤的研究生，实验时需要振荡瓶，由于学校没有，只得用啤酒瓶来代替。在安排实验的时间上，苏修当局也不放过刁难的机会，他们有意将我们一个研究生使用计算机的时间安排在深夜三四点钟。有些实验室，苏方对美国人大开方便之门，允许美国人自由参观，而当我们一位研究生因为学习需要提出要求去参观时，却遭到苏方的断然拒绝。研究生周夙帆到苏联已经两年，苏方还没有最后肯定她的研究题目。有的学科需要实习，苏方对本国和其他外国留学生都作了实习安排，唯独对中国研究生一律不安排实习。对大学生绝大部分也不安排实习，个别的安排了，也得不到应得的实习条件。
    在莫斯科门氏化工学院学习的两位中国大学生，按照学习计划要在工厂实习半年，而苏方只给了他们两个月的时间到沃龙涅什自动化研究所去“实习”。到了那里，苏方不让中国留学生去附属工厂实习，而只让他们在指定的房间看书，这些书中国学生不来“实习”也完全能读到。苏方给中国留学生看的一些自己单位的总结性文章，也都是过了时的没有价值的东西。两个月的时间眼看就要过去了，中国学生几次向苏方提出质问，苏方才不得不在最后两天领中国学生去工厂参观两次，两次在工厂的时间共一个小时。而同班的苏联学生都得到了半年实习，按期毕业。
    在门氏化工学院学习的中国留学生，按规定应学习六年，但为了限制中国留学生的学习，苏方无理把他们的学习年限改为五年。
    当苏方由于某些不可告人的政治目的达不到时，又经常以“成绩不好”为借口，逼迫我们的同学退学回国。我们有一位同学是一九六三年去列宁格勒当研究生的，苏联当局知道他是我们学生的负责人，便蓄意拉他下水，居然指使一个苏联人向我们的同学提出，要把他们实验室的一个女实验员介绍给他，当时即遭到我们同学的断然拒绝。对方竟厚颜无耻地说：“你可以不带回去，就在这里玩玩！”当时，我同学又严厉地予以驳斥。苏联当局的卑鄙阴谋失败后，老羞成怒，便在我们这位同学的学习上专挑毛病。在专业考试提问时，他们故意把问题提得很长，我们的同学由于听不清楚，要求重复一遍，他们便说我们的同学答不出来，蛮横地给了“不及格”的分数。补考时，他们又故意刁难，接着便以“学习不好”为名，勒令退学。
    我们中国同学由于党和毛主席的教导，向来热爱劳动，勤俭朴素，从来不计较生活条件和个人得失。但是，苏联修正主义领导当局在生活安排上对中国学生的歧视和迫害，使我们不能不表示愤慨。去年，有一个中国同学到苏联后，被苏方安置在一间三人住的极坏的土房子里。当听说中国大使馆有人要去看望自己的留学生时，他们便慌张地把这位中国同学转移到旅馆。在沃龙涅什大学，所有的外国学生都住在新楼里，只有三个中国同学住在一座旧楼的四层角落里。这座房子年久失修，屋顶积雪融化，水漏进屋子里，使我们同学的床、箱子和书籍遭了一场水灾。尤其令人不能容忍的，是在苏联塔什干的两名中国学生、新疆维吾尔族同学木明和满苏里的遭遇。当塔什干发生第一次地震以后，和我们中国学生一起居住的所有外国学生和苏联学生都被转移到了安全地点，只有中国学生不给转移。苏方领导竟无耻地说：“你们已经是五年级的学生了。其他人还只是一年级，死了可惜。”经中国同学四次抗议，在一个月之后才让他们搬了家。
    苏修新领导一向把中国留学生看作是他们的眼中钉、肉中刺，恨之入骨，对我们进行了种种残酷的法西斯式的政治迫害。他们经常派特务监视我们的行动，偷听我们的谈话，偷偷摸摸地对我们的谈话进行录音，偷看我们的书籍和学习材料，禁止中国学生会客，禁止苏联人甚至华侨和中国学生接触，指使流氓阻挠中国同学收听北京广播，无理扣留中国同学所订的祖国的《人民日报》。有的同学订了一年的《人民日报》，总共收到的还不到一个月。我们同学在苏修领导组织的反华报告会上据理进行反驳，苏修当局便污蔑说，中国学生不遵守法律，以押入监狱和开除来威胁。苏联当局借故对中国学生使用暴力，甚至陷害中国学生生命的事，也是不断发生的。去年三月四日，中国留学生参加外国留苏学生反美援越的游行示威，遭到苏联当局的残暴镇压，血洒莫斯科街头。苏修当局还指使特务，往中国留学生的饭锅里倒水银，扔香烟头和火柴盒。当我同学深夜熟睡后，竟遭到苏联暴徒毒打。尽管我们一再要求苏联当局保障我们同学的安全，但是，这种迫害中国学生的事并没有减少，相反，却更加猖狂了。
    今年十月十日，在列宁格勒大学举行了一个反华报告会。一群特务流氓在会议进行中，竟然跳上主席台，把我要求发言的三位同学强行分开，层层包围。一个流氓首先打了翁世耀同学两拳，然后四个人架着翁的胳膊，企图把他关进后台化妆室里。其他两位中国同学也遭到了类似的暴行。然而，中国同学不畏强暴，英勇地坚持了说理斗争。会后，苏修当局竟指使一群特务流氓跟踪我同学达两小时之久，有一暴徒伺机抢走了我同学手里的照相机。中国同学当即与这暴徒展开了斗争，这个暴徒由于惊慌，摔倒在地，中国同学乘机夺回了照相机。当时，来了一个苏联警察，中国同学向他控告苏联暴徒的流氓行为，可是这个家伙竟对这些流氓不作任何处理，相反却无理要求中国同学到警察局去。这个无理要求，当时就被我们的同学坚决拒绝了。
    苏修领导集团十分害怕真理，害怕群众，害怕毛泽东思想
    今年十月一日，为了庆祝我们伟大祖国——中华人民共和国成立十七周年，向苏联师生介绍中国伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就，依照惯例，中国留学生向所在单位领导申请举行小型图片展览。由于他们害怕真理，害怕毛泽东思想，害怕苏联群众了解中国的真实情况，绝大部分单位的领导当局都拒绝了我留学生的合理要求。门氏化工学院领导当局说，在任何地方，只要中国同学展览图片，就在二十四小时内马上全部开除。而经过一再努力被某些单位领导当局准许展出的图片，有的展出不过半小时，就被流氓强行撕去。基辅医学院的中国留学生举行的图片展览刚一展出，院党委负责人就带领流氓来把中国图片全部撕去。在伊尔库茨克学习的中国同学，经学校批准在宿舍展出图片后，很受群众欢迎。但学校领导由于害怕中苏人民友谊的发展，竟然出尔反尔，捏造中国学生搞反苏展览的谣言，挑拨大批苏联同学来向中国学生挑衅，企图强行夺去展览板。当苏联同学看到我们展出的照片并没有反苏内容，又经过我们同学说明事实真相后，绝大多数苏联同学都同情我们，认为学校当局禁止展览没有道理。他们的阴谋没有得逞，又想出新的花招，有的学校当局找我们“谈话”，公然提出禁止我留学生在展览板上写“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”并以此为理由，威胁我留学生说，如果不把这句口号去掉，就要指示暴徒来摘下照片，并将我在伊尔库茨克学习的全部留学生开除。他们的无理要求当即遭到我留学生的严词驳斥。在苏联科学院展出的图片，也是事前经院方批准的，但一经展出后，院主席团竟领着武装警察将图片强行撕去。当中国同学质问为什么允许美国在莫斯科搞展览而不许中国人展出图片时，对方竟回答说：“因为美国不反对我们。”这就是苏修联美反华的自供状。中国同学对这些野蛮的破坏中苏人民友谊和侮辱中国人民伟大领袖的暴行无比愤怒，一方面向有关当局进行了严正的说理斗争，同时提出了最强烈的抗议。而莫斯科地质学院的负责人却强行辩解说：“你想想，你们的照片和我们报上说的不一样，展出来若引起我们学生的思想混乱，怎么办？”请看，苏修领导害怕真理，害怕群众，竟到了如此地步。
    苏修领导集团使出种种卑鄙手段，妄图使我留学生背叛祖国
    为了达到其卑鄙的政治目的，苏联修正主义领导还企图用糖衣炮弹来打倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国留学生。他们经常指示他们的党员来向我们宣扬资产阶级思想和生活方式，幻想以什么博士学位和高工资等物质刺激，来引诱中国学生和平演变。当遭到中国学生严正批驳后，他们又施出了金钱美女计，无耻地对中国同学说：“如果钱不够用，或想寄回家去，可以给予帮助。”伊尔库茨克州委负责教育工作的领导人，竟公然说，你们留在苏联，找个苏联姑娘，在我们这里安家吧！他们这种用心真是卑鄙无耻到了极点。
    更令人气愤的是，当苏联政府片面撕毁了两国文化协定，勒令我留学生休学并限期回国后，竟指使一些苏共党员向中国留学生公开搞策反活动。在伊尔库茨克，苏联当局曾指使一个苏共党员多次分别地找我留学生“谈话”，妄图诱逼我留苏学生背叛自己的祖国。他卑鄙无耻地说：“你们国内发生着可怕的事情，如果我是你们，我就要求政治避难，留在苏联不回去了。”又说：“如果你们要求政治避难，只要在纸上签个字就行了。”苏联修正主义者真是瞎了眼，使人感到又气愤又可笑。当我同学追问是谁派他来的，他供认说：“这不是我个人的意见，这是我们商量好的。”我们当即向苏方提出了最严重的抗议。在事实面前，他们的校长不得不承认错误。
    当苏联修正主义者的“笑脸”装不下去时，就露出了法西斯匪徒的凶相。塔什干的修正主义领导当局，蓄意隐瞒苏联政府无理勒令我留学生回国的决定，企图秘密扣留中国留学生木明。当木明同学接到我使馆要他离开塔什干赴莫斯科的通知时，苏方竟公然派出警察、打手，强力夺取木明同学的箱子，撞伤了他的胳膊。当他们用武力达不到目的时，又以行李过多为借口，不让木明同学上火车。由于木明同学进行了英勇的斗争和得到非洲革命同学的帮助，修正主义的阴谋终于破产了。
    苏联人民是永远和我们站在一起的
    中国留学生的革命精神和优良的思想作风，在广大苏联人民心目中留下了深刻的印象，得到了热烈的赞扬。许多苏联同学和人民对我们说：“是毛泽东同志把你们培养得这样好。”有的说：“我们这里有许多许多关于你们国家的坏话，可是当我们和你们接触过几次以后，就认识到他们是在扯谎。如果中国真的那么坏，怎么有你们这样的好人呢？”有位教员说：“我教了十几年书，还没有教过像你们这样好的学生。我很愿意和你们一起学习，我想把你们教到底，但我没有办法。你们回去后，如果在学习上有什么困难，请写信来，我一定给你们解答。”
    苏修领导集团十分害怕革命，害怕人民，害怕毛泽东思想在苏联传播。他们以为赶走了中国留学生就可以安心了。然而，事情总是按照修正主义设想的反面发展的。我们最伟大的导师毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”事情正是这样。苏联一位工人对我们说：“赶你们走是没有道理的。他们（指苏共领导）所干的就是赫鲁晓夫的一套，报纸上天天骂你们，可是我认为这是撒谎。”还有一位苏联青年说：“你们回去吧，回去按你们认为正确的道路走下去。你们一定会达到自己的目的，会得到胜利，而我们苏联现在是迷失方向了。”
    不少苏联人现在已经看透了苏共新领导的本质，认清了他们是不折不扣的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，并且比赫鲁晓夫走得更远。我们深深地体会到，苏联人民是永远和我们站在一起的。他们对苏联修正主义领导集团蓄意破坏中苏关系，破坏中苏两国人民友谊以及对中国留苏学生所作的种种坏事，表示了极大的愤怒。在这次我们和他们告别的时候，有的人含着泪水表示惜别。有人对我们说：“请记住，苏联人民对你们是友好的，这只是上边一些领导人干的坏事。”还有的说：“这些新领导（指苏共领导）在中苏关系上没有作一件好事。作为一个苏联人和普通的共产党员，我对他们的愚蠢作法也感到可耻。而我们苏联人是要和中国友好的。”这就是苏联人民的态度。苏联修正主义领导集团干尽了坏事，他们的日子不会很长了。苏联人民起来打倒修正主义的日子，就要到来的！
