I am from Japan, and my name is Miyazaki Masao.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to the liberation of the Chinese people and used Japan as a base for his revolutionary activities. Although he faced persecution and suppression from the Japanese government, he was deeply loved by the Japanese people.

Personally, due to the close relationship between my father Minzō, my uncle Tōzō, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen, I have known about Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionary comrades' activities since I was young. In 1913, when Dr. Sun Yat-sen visited Japan, he also visited my hometown. At that time, I was a boy of twelve or thirteen. The impression he left on me during that time is the most profound memory of my life, and it remains vivid to this day.

Japan and China are neighboring countries separated by the sea. Therefore, the history of exchanges between the two nations is long and rich, which is only natural. Everyone knows that Abe no Nakamaro and the Chinese monk Jianzhen, with their courage and wisdom, made outstanding contributions to the friendly exchanges between the two nations. In this process of mutual exchange, I am not very knowledgeable about how much Japanese culture has influenced China. What we believe is important is that, in this long history of friendly exchanges, Chinese culture has deeply permeated the lives of our ancestors, the Japanese people.

We believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen is not only a great pioneer of China's democratic revolution but also made brilliant contributions to the friendship and unity of the peoples of Japan and China. Moreover, I would like to point out that Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who was not only a revolutionary fighting for the liberation of the Chinese people but also a revolutionary with the ideal of fighting for the liberation of the oppressed peoples of Asia, made his contributions to the Japanese people not in the fields of culture or technology, but in the field of politics.

In other words, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, on the one hand, had great expectations for Japan, which had transitioned from feudalism to capitalism through the Meiji Restoration, and on the other hand, gave a stern critique of the rising Japanese militarism. He often passionately appealed to the Japanese people: they should not follow the path of militarism but should oppose militarism and walk the path of Asian national independence and unity.

Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen is a practitioner who promoted the friendship between the two peoples and established genuine Japan-China friendship. For us who are engaged in the Japan-China friendship movement, he is a most respected predecessor.

During his lifetime, Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not achieve his ideal of liberating the Chinese people. In 1925, Dr. Sun Yat-sen left behind the famous words "The revolution is not yet successful" and passed away. However, twenty-four years later, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the great Chinese people shattered all the shackles of feudal forces and imperialist forces, liberated themselves, and established the People's Republic of China. In the seventeen years since then, the Chinese people have not only completed the democratic revolution that Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not achieve but are also continuing the socialist revolution. They are building socialism on the basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat, under the brilliant guidance of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that China is currently carrying out is aimed at further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and has already achieved great successes, which will give new confidence and encouragement to the revolutionary forces of the world.

The movement for the independence of Asian nations and the unity of oppressed peoples around the world, which Dr. Sun Yat-sen had always advocated, is now, with the support of the Chinese people, sweeping across the world like a storm, overwhelming the imperialists, old and new colonialists, various revisionists, and all reactionaries. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, Japanese militarism increasingly took the path of full-scale aggression against China, causing serious losses to the peoples of both countries. After the Second World War, the Japanese people, through this bitter lesson, deeply realized that without friendship with China, there can be no peace and prosperity, and thus have a deeper understanding of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advice to the Japanese people.

Now, due to the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam, the world is facing a serious threat of disaster. However, as Chairman Mao Zedong teaches, the U.S. imperialists are a paper tiger. As long as the people of the world unite to defeat it, avoiding the serious disaster of war is not impossible.

I believe that the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China has never been as important as it is today. At this very moment, the People's Republic of China is holding such a grand commemorative ceremony, and we, as representatives of the Japanese people, are honored to participate in this conference. At the same time, in Japan, to further make the broader Japanese people understand Dr. Sun Yat-sen's indomitable revolutionary spirit and his brilliant achievements in Japan-China friendship, we are also holding commemorative activities. Today, a commemorative ceremony and a commemorative lecture are being held in Tokyo.

Only Japan-China friendship can guarantee the security and prosperity of the two countries and peace in Asia.

Let us use Japan-China friendship to oppose our common enemy, U.S. imperialism!

Let us strengthen the unity of the peoples of Asia with Japan-China friendship as the center!

Let us pass down the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who advocated Japan-China friendship and Asian unity, from generation to generation!

    在孙中山先生诞生一百周年纪念大会上
    日中友协理事长宫崎世民的讲话
    我是从日本来的，我叫宫崎世民。
    孙文先生为了中国人民的解放，曾把日本作为革命活动的一个据点。他虽然遭到日本政府的迫害和镇压，但日本人民对他是非常爱戴的。
    我个人，由于家父民藏、伯父寅藏和孙文先生交情深厚，所以很早以前对孙文先生和其他革命同志的活动，就有所耳闻。一九一三年，孙文先生到日本时，顺便访问了我的家乡。当时，我是十二、三岁的少年。在我的一生中，那时所受的感动，是最大的一次，迄今仍记忆犹新。
    日本和中国，是一海相隔的邻邦。因此，两个民族之间的来往历史有着极为长期而丰富的内容，是理所当然的事。大家都知道，日本的阿部仲麻吕和中国的鉴真和尚等人，曾以他们的勇气和智慧，为两个民族的友好往来作出了卓越的贡献。在这个相互往来的过程中，日本的文化给予中国多大影响，我是不大了解的。我们认为重要的是，在这个悠久的友好往来的历史中，中国的文化深深地渗透到日本民族即我们祖先的生活之中。
    我们认为，孙文先生既是中国民主革命的伟大先驱，又为日中两国人民的友好和团结作出了辉煌的贡献。而且，我要在这里指出，由于孙文先生不仅是为中国人民的解放而奋斗的革命家，而且也是抱有为亚洲被压迫民族的解放而奋斗的理想的革命家，所以他为日本人民所作的贡献，不是表现在文化或技术方面，而是表现在政治方面。
    也就是说，孙文先生一方面对于经过明治维新而从封建制过渡到资本主义的日本寄予很大的期待，一方面又对刚刚开始发展起来的日本军国主义给予严厉的批判。他经常满腔热情地向日本人民呼吁：不应走军国主义道路，而应该反对军国主义，走亚洲民族独立团结的道路。
    因此，孙文先生是促进两国人民友好和建立真正的日中友好的实践者。对于我们从事日中友好运动的人来说，他是最值得我们尊敬的前辈。
    孙文先生在世时，未能实现其解放中国人民的理想。一九二五年，孙文先生留下“革命尚未成功”的名言，而逝世了。但是，二十四年之后，伟大的中国人民在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导下，粉碎了所有封建势力和帝国主义势力的枷锁，解放了自己，建立了中华人民共和国。十七年来，中国人民不仅完成了孙文先生未能完成的民主革命，而且正在继续进行社会主义革命，正在无产阶级专政的基础上，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，进行着社会主义建设。现在中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命是为了进一步巩固无产阶级专政，并已取得了巨大成就，这将给予世界革命力量以新的信心和鼓舞。
    孙文先生所一直提倡的亚洲各民族的独立和全世界被压迫民族的独立团结运动，在中国人民的支援下，正以暴风骤雨之势，压倒帝国主义者、新老殖民主义者、形形色色的修正主义者和一切反动派。孙文先生逝世后，日本军国主义日益走上全面侵略中国的道路，使日中两国人民遭到严重的损失。第二次世界大战后，日本人民通过这个惨痛的教训，深刻地认识到日本不同中国友好，就不可能有和平和繁荣，从而，对孙文先生向日本人民提出的劝告有了进一步的体会。
    现在，由于美帝国主义对越南的侵略，全世界正面临着严重灾难的威胁。可是正如毛泽东主席所教导的，美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，只要世界人民团结起来击败它，那么避免战争的严重灾难就不是不可能的。
    我认为日中两国人民的战斗友谊，从来没有像今天这样重要。正在这个时候，中华人民共和国举行如此盛大的纪念仪式，我们作为日本人民的代表参加这个大会，感到光荣。与此同时，在日本为了进一步使更广泛的日本人民了解孙文先生不屈不挠的革命精神和辉煌的日中友好业绩，也在举办纪念活动，今天东京正在举行纪念仪式和纪念讲演会。
    只有日中友好才是两国安全繁荣和亚洲和平的保障。
    让我们用日中友好来反对共同敌人美帝国主义！
    让我们以日中友好为中心来加强亚洲各民族的团结！
    让我们把倡导日中友好和亚洲团结的孙文先生的遗志世世代代地传下去！
