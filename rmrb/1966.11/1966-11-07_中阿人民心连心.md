We, the members of the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune, are filled with the most excited and fervent feelings as we congratulate the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania.

We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries are flourishing. The heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Party of Labour of Albania, are firmly holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism in the face of the threats and encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism, setting a brilliant example for the revolutionary peoples of the whole world. We are proud and honored to have such a steadfast and fearless friend as Albania.

Chairman Mao said: "'Within the seas there are friends, distant as the horizon yet close as neighbors.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are united." We, the members of the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune, have had more exchanges with Albanian comrades and have a deeper personal understanding of this.

We often receive visiting Albanian guests, and each of their visits deepens our friendship and mutual understanding. What is particularly unforgettable is that in early October of this year, the entire staff of the Albanian Embassy in our country came to our commune to work. Ambassador Vasili Nataneli told us: "In Albania, cadres are sent down to work. While we are in Beijing, we also often come to your commune to work." The embassy staff worked with our vegetable team members, pulling radishes with great enthusiasm. They were not afraid of getting dirty or tired, and some had blisters on their hands but still insisted on working. Working with the embassy staff, we felt how much the people of Albania, educated by the Party of Labour of Albania, share the same thoughts and feelings as the Chinese people!

During rest times, the embassy staff also studied Chairman Mao's quotations with us and sang revolutionary songs together. Most of them can sing "The East Is Red." Although we do not understand the language of the Albanian comrades, we can strongly feel their love and respect for Chairman Mao. Their feelings are the same as ours, the Chinese people, towards Comrade Enver Hoxha. We sincerely wish the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania a complete success!

We wish the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, even greater achievements in their struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and in their socialist revolution and socialist construction at home!

    中阿人民心连心
    我们中阿友好人民公社全体社员，以最兴奋、最热烈的心情，祝贺阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的召开。
    我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。各国人民的革命运动正在蓬勃发展。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，面对帝国主义和现代修正主义的威胁和包围，坚定地高举着马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，为全世界革命人民树立了一个光辉的榜样。我们有像阿尔巴尼亚这样坚定、无畏的朋友，感到十分骄傲和光荣。
    毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”我们中阿友好人民公社的社员，同阿尔巴尼亚同志往来比较多，对这一点更是有着亲切的感受。
    我们经常接待来访的阿尔巴尼亚贵宾，他们的每次访问，都加深了我们之间的友谊和相互了解。特别使我们难忘的是，今年十月初，阿尔巴尼亚驻我国大使馆全体人员来我社劳动。瓦西里·纳塔奈利大使对我们说：“在阿尔巴尼亚，干部要下放和参加劳动。我们在北京，也要经常到你们公社参加劳动。”大使馆的同志跟我们菜园队的社员在一起拔萝卜，干得很欢。他们不怕脏、不怕累，有的同志手都磨出了泡，仍然坚持劳动。我们同大使馆的同志在一起，感觉到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党教育出来的人民，同我们中国人民的思想感情是多么一致啊！
    在休息的时候，使馆的同志还跟我们一起学习毛主席语录，大唱革命歌曲。他们大多数人都会唱《东方红》。阿尔巴尼亚同志说的话，虽然我们听不懂，但他们对毛主席的热爱和崇敬的心情，我们完全可以强烈地感受到。他们的这种感情，正和我们中国人民对恩维尔·霍查同志的感情一样。我们衷心地祝贺阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会获得完满的成功！
    祝阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，在本国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中，取得更加辉煌的成就！
