Chairman Mao's eighth reception of the Cultural Revolution Army has made revolutionary youth in various places more resolute and determined to carry out the Cultural Revolution thoroughly in their respective regions.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards from various places who are on the front line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, upon hearing the joyous news of Chairman Mao receiving the Cultural Revolution Army for the last time before the spring warmth, have resolved to better arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, to better learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. They will thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, push forward the Cultural Revolution in their respective regions and units, and strive to report more abundant revolutionary achievements to the most beloved Chairman Mao.

Over the past three months, millions of revolutionary youth who have been inspected by Chairman Mao have returned to their battle stations with high spirits from Chairman Mao's side, spreading the spark of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ignited by Chairman Mao across the country. The news of Chairman Mao receiving the revolutionary youth for the last time before the spring warmth has further inspired their resolve to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly and well in their respective regions and units. Revolutionary youth in Changchun, Urumqi, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, and other places have, upon returning from Chairman Mao's side, combined the situation in their respective regions and units, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points," summarized the experiences of the previous stage of struggle, and formulated plans for future battles. Recently, many Red Guards from Shenyang Medical College have used Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points" as weapons to hold several debates criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, determined to further carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their respective regions and units, and to achieve greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary youth in Yinchuan have expressed their determination to turn Chairman Mao's great concern and support into fighting strength, to face difficulties head-on, to advance against obstacles, to firmly defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Recently, many revolutionary youth in Wuhan held a meeting to discuss their happy feelings after being inspected by the great leader Chairman Mao and to share their experiences of revolutionary connections to various places. They said: Chairman Mao has received the revolutionary youth time and time again, giving us the fearless spirit of revolution and boundless wisdom. Whenever we think of Chairman Mao, we are full of energy, daring to do everything, and all demons and obstacles are nothing to us. Some revolutionary youth in Tianjin recently used the method of open rectification to summarize their experiences of struggle. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to remain humble in the face of achievements, to demand of themselves according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and to ensure that the Cultural Revolution in their respective regions and units advances victoriously along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao. They will thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminate its influence, resolutely complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, carry out the Cultural Revolution thoroughly, and will not stop until they achieve complete victory.

Broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards have deeply felt from their revolutionary practice over the past period that the main force of revolution and construction is the working people. They remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "learn from the workers, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants," and after returning from Chairman Mao's side, they have, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thrown themselves into the working people, tempering and transforming themselves, determined to become "voluntarily red." A batch of Red Guards who have just returned from the Daqing Oil Field talked about their experiences, saying that the people of Daqing are loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought, and are models of ideological revolutionization. Daqing workers dare to rebel against imperialism, revisionism, and the bourgeois reactionary "authorities," dare to struggle, and dare to win. With their fearless revolutionary spirit, they have removed the hat of backwardness in China's petroleum industry and achieved astonishing heroic feats, which is our model to learn from. They are determined to use the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing people, who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to pioneer, dare to rebel, to carry out the Cultural Revolution in their respective units and regions. Red Guards from many colleges and universities in Guangzhou, Xi'an, Kunming, Nanjing, and Shanghai have gone to the countryside to participate in autumn harvest, winter sowing, fertilizer collection, and water conservation, living, eating, and working with the commune members. They have seen with their own eyes the commune members' limitless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, their hardworking, brave, and modest style, and their revolutionary qualities of being ruthless to the enemy and lenient to themselves. They have received profound education and are determined to be good children of the working people, to apply what they have learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants to the struggle of the Cultural Revolution. Many Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from outside have, upon hearing the joyous news of Chairman Mao's eighth reception of revolutionary youth in Hangzhou, flocked to the Qianjiang Bridge to mourn the communist warrior Cai Yongxiang, who was dedicated to the public. They have resolved to take Cai Yongxiang as their example, to use the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," to work hard on transforming their worldview, to serve the people wholeheartedly, and to be like Cai Yongxiang, loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, studying tirelessly, working without fear of difficulties, struggling without fear of setbacks, transforming thoughts without fear of pain, daring to climb mountains of knives and to plunge into seas of fire, and vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Many revolutionary youth in various places have also taken the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as their glorious task. They have voluntarily organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, compiled Chairman Mao's quotations and the joyous news of Chairman Mao receiving revolutionary teachers and students into literary performances and leaflets, and widely propagated them in streets, stations, factories, and rural areas. Broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students have expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more consciously, diligently, and painstakingly, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought at all times and in all places, and to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought, making our country a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛主席第八次接见文化革命大军使各地革命小将更加斗志昂扬
    决心把本地区的文化大革命搞深搞透
    据新华社二十九日讯　正在无产阶级文化大革命第一线冲锋陷阵的各地广大革命师生和红卫兵小将，听到伟大领袖毛主席在明年春暖前最后一次接见文化革命大军的喜讯，决心更好地用毛泽东思想武装自己，更好地向工农兵学习，沿着毛主席指引的方向，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把本地区、本单位的文化大革命推向前进，争取以更丰硕的革命成果向最敬爱的毛主席汇报。
    三个多月以来，各地受到毛主席检阅的千百万革命小将，陆续从毛主席身边斗志昂扬地回到自己的战斗岗位，把毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的火种传遍全国。毛主席在明年春暖前最后一次接见革命小将的喜讯，更进一步激励了他们把本地区、本单位无产阶级文化大革命搞深搞透、搞得更好的坚强意志。长春、乌鲁木齐、兰州、太原、郑州等地许多革命小将，从毛主席身边回来以后，都结合本地区、本单位的情况，反复学习了毛主席著作和“十六条”，总结了前一阶段的斗争经验，并且订出了今后的战斗计划。沈阳医学院的许多红卫兵最近以毛主席著作和“十六条”为武器，多次召开了批判资产阶级反动路线的辩论会，决心进一步搞好本地区、本单位的斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更大胜利。银川市的许多革命小将表示，一定把毛主席的巨大关怀和支持化为战斗力量，迎着困难走，朝着阻力行，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。武汉市的许多革命小将最近集会，座谈了受到伟大领袖毛主席检阅以后的幸福心情，交流了到各地进行革命串连的经验。他们说：毛主席一次又一次接见革命小将，给了我们革命造反的大无畏精神和无穷的智慧。我们一想到毛主席，就浑身是劲，敢字当头，一切牛鬼蛇神，一切艰难险阻，统统不在话下。天津一些革命小将最近用开门整风的办法，总结了斗争经验。他们表示，一定要遵循毛主席的教导，有了成绩戒骄戒躁，以毛主席的指示要求自己，决心使本地区、本单位的文化大革命沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道胜利前进，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的影响，坚决完成一斗二批三改的任务，把文化大革命搞深搞透，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    广大革命师生和红卫兵从前一段的革命实践中，深切地体会到：革命和建设的主力军，是工农群众。他们牢记毛主席“向工人学习，向贫农下中农学习”的教导，从毛主席身边回来以后，就按照毛主席的指示，投身到工农群众中去，锻炼自己，改造自己，决心做到“自觉红”。一批刚从大庆油田回来的红卫兵畅谈体会时说，大庆人忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，是思想革命化的典范。大庆工人敢于造帝国主义的反，造修正主义的反，造资产阶级反动“权威”的反，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，以大无畏的革命精神，摘掉了中国石油落后的帽子，干出了惊天动地的英雄业绩，这就是我们学习的样板。他们决心用大庆人敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的革命精神，来搞好本单位本地区的文化大革命。广州、西安、昆明、南京、上海等地许多大中学校红卫兵，到农村参加秋收冬种、积肥、修水利，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动，亲眼看到社员们无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想，看到他们勤劳勇敢、朴实谦逊的作风，对敌狠、对己和的革命品质，受到了深刻的教育。他们决心做劳动人民的好儿女，把从贫下中农身上学到的东西，用到文化大革命的斗争中去。来自外地的许多红卫兵和革命师生，在杭州听到毛主席第八次接见革命小将的喜讯，纷纷到钱塘江大桥，悼念一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥同志。他们决心以蔡永祥为榜样，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，活学活用“老三篇”，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，全心全意为人民服务，像蔡永祥那样，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，学习不知疲倦，工作不怕困难，斗争不畏挫折，改造思想不怕痛苦，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    各地许多革命小将还把宣传毛泽东思想做为自己的光荣任务。他们自动组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，把毛主席语录和毛主席接见革命师生的喜讯，编成文艺节目，写成传单，到街头、车站、工厂和农村，广泛进行宣传。广大革命师生表示：一定要更自觉、更勤奋、更刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，随时随地宣传毛泽东思想，一定要大立毛泽东思想，使我国成为一座毛泽东思想的大学校。
