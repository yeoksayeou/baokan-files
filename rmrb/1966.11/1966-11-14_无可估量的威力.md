The "Sea Tiger Boats," in the Chongwu Sea Battle, were smaller in tonnage, weaker in firepower, and less equipped than the enemy. However, together with their sister ships, they managed to defeat one after another of the much "stronger" enemy vessels, achieving one victory after another. What was their secret? It was the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The sailors of the Sea Tiger Boats said it well: the technical capabilities of a warship are limited and can be quantified, but the power of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought is immeasurable.

Chairman Mao said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." The heroic deeds of the Sea Tiger Boats once again prove this great truth.

Weapons are made by people. With people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, any modern weapon can be produced. Weapons are used by people. The effectiveness of weapons depends on the user's mental state. "Only with a red heart can the sights be true." If people are not brave, even the best weapons cannot be fully utilized. On the contrary, even the most inferior weapons, in the hands of fearless revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can unleash a thousandfold power.

The "Sea Tiger Boats" have, under the leadership of the Party branch, made the study and application of Chairman Mao's works the foundation of the unit's construction. They require officers and soldiers to use the "Three Articles" as their weapon, constantly to eliminate bourgeois thoughts and establish proletarian thoughts, to transform their thinking, and to raise their consciousness. Thus, their selfless spirit is firmly established, and their resolve to dedicate themselves to the revolution is greatly enhanced. Bravery comes from selflessness. Selfless people are the bravest. Our soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, possess an unyielding spirit, and can overcome all enemies, never yielding to any enemy. From this, it can be seen that in all our work, we must emphasize the human factor, carry out the ideological transformation of people, and arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

    无可估量的威力
    洪海声
    “海上猛虎艇”，在崇武海战中，论吨位，比敌人小；论火力，比敌人弱；论装备，比敌人差。但是，他们和兄弟舰艇一起，硬是把比自己“强大”得多的大型敌舰一只一只地吃掉，取得了一个又一个的胜利。他们靠的是什么？靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠的是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。猛虎艇的战士们说得好：兵舰的技术力量是有限的，是可以用数字计算的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人的威力则是无可估量的。
    毛主席说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”猛虎艇的英雄事迹，又一次证明了这条伟大真理。
    武器，是人制造的。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，任何现代化武器都可以制造出来。武器，是人使用的。武器作用的发挥，取决于人的精神状态。“只有思想红，才能准星正。”人不勇敢，再好的武器，也不能充分发挥作用。相反，即使再差的武器，掌握在用毛泽东思想武装起来的大无畏的革命战士手里，却能够发挥出千百倍的威力。
    “海上猛虎艇”，正由于党支部把活学活用毛主席著作当成部队建设的根本，要求干部战士以“老三篇”为武器，不断地灭资兴无，破私立公，改造思想，提高觉悟。因而，为公的思想牢牢的，献身于革命的决心大大的。勇敢来自无私。无私的人最无畏。我们的战士，用毛泽东思想武装起来，具有了一往无前的精神，就能压倒一切敌人，而决不被任何敌人所屈服。由此可见，我们做一切工作，都一定要突出人的因素，搞人的思想革命化，用毛泽东思想把人的头脑武装起来。
