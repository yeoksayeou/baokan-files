The Master Switch

Fushun Longfeng Coal Mine Worker Lü Zhengang

Chairman Mao said: "A change in worldview is a fundamental change." This statement is absolutely correct. I feel that a worldview is like a "master switch." If the "master switch" problem is not resolved, no lamp in the corridor will light up, and there will be problems in all aspects. If the "master switch" problem is resolved, all motors will run, and ten thousand lamps will shine brightly, making work as smooth as breaking bamboo.

The "master switch" of the proletarian worldview is the character "public" (公). Only by grasping this "master switch" of selflessness, by placing the interests of the revolution, the people, and the liberation of humanity above everything else, can one truly achieve "selflessness, diligence, self-discipline, and hard work," and become the kind of person Chairman Mao described: a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person free from vulgar interests, and a person beneficial to the people.

The character "self" (私) is the "master switch" of the bourgeois worldview. This "master switch" is the source of all evil. A proletarian revolutionary must struggle against the character "self" for a lifetime. Struggling against "self" is not a one-time effort; it must be a continuous struggle. If you do not defeat it, it will defeat you. Only by constantly struggling against "self" can one truly be selfless and devote oneself wholeheartedly to the revolution.

Resolving the "master switch" problem is a matter of utmost importance. To resolve this problem, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought and must study and apply Chairman Mao's works daily, just as one washes one's face and eats every day. If you skip a day without washing your face, dust will accumulate; if you skip a day without eating, your stomach will be empty. If you forget Chairman Mao's teachings for a day, the character "self" will sneak in and take control.

    “总开关”
    抚顺龙凤煤矿工人　吕振刚
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。”这话说的太正确了。我体会，世界观好比一个“总开关”，“总开关”的问题不解决，巷道里的哪一盏灯也不能亮，各方面都会出问题。“总开关”的问题解决了，台台马达都能转起来，万盏明灯放光辉，工作起来就会势如破竹。
    无产阶级世界观的“总开关”就是一个“公”字。只有掌握这个一心为公的“总开关”，把革命的利益、人民的利益、人类解放的利益看得高于一切，才能真正做到“大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干”，才能成为毛主席所说的那样高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。
      “私”字是资产阶级世界观的“总开关”。这个“总开关”是万恶之源。无产阶级革命战士，革命一辈子，就必须和“私”字斗争一辈子。和“私”字斗，不能一劳永逸，要经常斗。你不斗倒它，它就斗倒你。只有一个劲地和“私”字斗，才能一心为公，才能一个心眼干革命。
    解决“总开关”的问题，是个头等重要的大问题。解决这个问题要靠毛泽东思想，必须像洗脸、吃饭一样，天天活学活用毛主席著作。一天不洗脸，灰尘就去不掉，一天不吃饭，肚子就空，一天忘了毛主席的教导，“私”这个东西就会钻进来，就会占上风。
