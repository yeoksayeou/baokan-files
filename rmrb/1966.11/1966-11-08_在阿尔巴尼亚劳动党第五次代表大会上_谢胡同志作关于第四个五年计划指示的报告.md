At the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Party's Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a report on the directives for the fourth five-year plan for the development of the economy and culture of the People's Republic of Albania from 1966 to 1970.

Comrade Shehu said in his report that the Fifth Congress of the Party is being held on the 25th anniversary of our Party's revolutionary life. In these 25 years, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, our Party has brilliantly and courageously led the Albanian people from one victory to another on the revolutionary path.

The brilliant victories our Party has achieved in these 25 years were not easily won; they were won through fierce and arduous class struggles both within the country and internationally. How many imperialist plots we have smashed! How many plots and tricks of the Titoite and Khrushchevite revisionists we have foiled! Under the correct leadership of our Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, our people have stood firm, smashed them, and triumphed over them.

Today, our Party is welcoming the Fifth Congress as a victor. The nearly six years from the Fourth Congress to the Fifth Congress have been the most difficult period for our Party and people since the national liberation struggle.

As is known, the Third Five-Year Plan adopted by the Fourth Congress of the Party originally had loans from the Soviet Union and other revisionist countries that were agreed upon before the Congress. However, after the Fourth Congress of our Party, Khrushchev and his henchmen immediately cancelled these loans, organized a comprehensive blockade, and expanded ideological differences to state and economic relations. Khrushchev even severed diplomatic relations with our country, seized our warships, tore up all agreements, and in collusion with the Yugoslav revisionists, Greek reactionaries, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet, organized the infamous plot against Albania, attempting to change the situation in Albania to their advantage.

However, they did not take into account the power of unity between our Party and people, nor did they consider our revolutionary resolve to face all difficulties, overcome all obstacles, and never yield or be enslaved.

Today, we can report to the Fifth Congress that despite the savage blockade by revisionism and imperialism, our Third Five-Year Plan did not fail as Khrushchev had anticipated, but was basically completed successfully. This is a great historical victory for our people and Party.

Under the severe circumstances of the comprehensive blockade by revisionism, the People's Republic of China did not hesitate to provide us with all possible assistance. This assistance is extremely precious to us. Our people and Party will never forget the assistance given to us by friends in times of danger, and we will forever be grateful to the 700 million brothers of the Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong.

On the execution of the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture from 1961 to 1965

Comrade Shehu said in discussing the results of the execution of the Third Five-Year Plan that, first, under the difficult conditions of the savage blockade by revisionism and imperialism, we have taken an important step forward in building the material and technical foundation of socialism. Today, the material and technical foundation of industry not only ensures the further development of industrial production but also helps other sectors of the national economy to complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

Second, we have taken an important first step in transforming our country from an agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country. The total industrial output of the Third Five-Year Plan increased by 62% compared to the Second Five-Year Plan. The proportion of industrial production in the total industrial and agricultural output (calculated at 1966 prices) increased from 48.4% in 1960 to 56.6% in 1965.

Third, despite the difficulties caused by the revisionist blockade and the droughts and floods in the first two years of the Five-Year Plan, agricultural production still grew at a faster rate than during the Second Five-Year Plan. The average annual growth rate of agricultural production during the Third Five-Year Plan was 6.4%.

Fourth, the material living standards of the working people have improved, especially in the countryside.

Comrade Shehu then discussed the completion of tasks in five areas: industry, agriculture, investment and construction, transportation and postal services, improving people's welfare, and developing culture.

Shehu pointed out that in 1965, the total industrial output increased by 39% compared to 1960 and by 33.8 times compared to 1938, meaning that in 1965, less than 11 days were needed to produce the industrial output of 1938.

The total agricultural output of the Third Five-Year Plan increased by 29% compared to the Second Five-Year Plan, and the agricultural output in 1965 increased by 36% compared to 1960. Compared to previous Five-Year Plans, this is the highest growth rate in agricultural production our country has achieved so far.

Due to the implementation of the seven basic principles of the agricultural code determined by the Fourth Congress of the Party, the expansion of the sowing area, and the increase in the yield per unit area of crops, 1965 produced 51% more grain, 120% more rice, and 53% more cotton than 1960.

The investment of the Third Five-Year Plan increased by 43% compared to the Second Five-Year Plan. The construction volume in 1965 increased by 53% compared to 1960, exceeding the plan by 14%.

The great people of China provided us with tremendous and timely assistance, supplying us with designs, machinery, equipment, and materials in the shortest possible time. Excellent Chinese experts also provided us with invaluable help, working in a fraternal and internationalist manner with our experts to overcome all difficulties in building new industrial projects. This was a heavy blow to the imperialists and the revisionists led by Khrushchev. During the Third Five-Year Plan, a total of 430 economic projects and social and cultural facilities were completed and put into production and use, while the Fourth Congress of the Party had determined 400. Most of these projects were designed by our own engineers, experts, and construction workers, including those that the revisionist-controlled countries had originally started to design for us or promised to design for us.

Shehu said that the revisionists took savage measures against our country, dreaming of lowering our living standards, raising the prices of consumer goods, and worsening the people's economic situation. However, on the contrary, in the countries ruled by revisionists, prices soared sharply. In our country, prices did not only not rise but actually fell.

Shehu emphasized that under the domestic and international situation in which we live, work, and fight, these achievements are indeed great, and they are a fairly good starting point for us to launch a general offensive to successfully complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

The Fifth Congress of the Party on the directives for the fourth five-year plan for the development of the economy and culture of the People's Republic of Albania from 1966 to 1970

Shehu said that the draft directives for the Fourth Five-Year Plan are a grand program to advance more rapidly on the road to the comprehensive construction of a socialist society.

The main tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan are: to ensure the further development of our productive forces to accelerate the construction of the material and technical foundation of socialism. To achieve this, we will continue to carry out the socialist industrialization of the country, improve industrial production by making fuller use of existing production capacities and building new projects, and primarily through the further intensification of agriculture, concentrate our efforts to develop agriculture more rapidly, especially grain production. On the basis of improving social production, raise the material and cultural level of the people, strengthen the national defense forces. At the same time, on the correct revolutionary road, further improve socialist production relations, gradually narrow the gap between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and manual labor; deepen the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields; strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the unity of the people with the Party; carry out sharp and uncompromising class struggle against domestic and foreign enemies; and continuously promote the socialist revolution in all fields.

The main tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan determine the main characteristics of this plan:

First, the Fourth Five-Year Plan has an important turning point in the speed of development of industrial and agricultural production. If the Third Five-Year Plan had an average annual increase of 8.6% in the total industrial and agricultural output (the original plan was 6.7%), then the Fourth Five-Year Plan will increase the growth rate to about 10%.

Second, the Fourth Five-Year Plan is a five-year plan to reduce the imbalance between industry and agriculture, ensuring that the growth of agricultural production is not only greater than in the Third Five-Year Plan but also grows faster than industrial production.

Third, the Fourth Five-Year Plan will be a five-year plan to improve the structure of industrial production, prioritizing the development of the production of means of production, especially the mining industry, with a larger scale than the Third Five-Year Plan.

Fourth, the Fourth Five-Year Plan has large investments, with 80% of the investments used in the production sector to improve productivity and social production. The total investment of the Fourth Five-Year Plan is equal to the sum of the total investments of the First and Third Five-Year Plans.

Fifth, compared to the Third Five-Year Plan, the national income will have a significant increase during the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

Sixth, the Fourth Five-Year Plan is a five-year plan to improve the quality of cultural education, a five-year plan to deeply carry out the ideological and cultural revolution according to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism; a five-year plan to further intensify the struggle to block the channels for the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country.

In discussing the tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan to improve industrial and agricultural production, Shehu pointed out that by 1970, the total industrial and agricultural output will increase by 58% to 63% compared to 1965.

During the Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output will increase by 50% to 54%, with an average annual increase of about 8.7%. The production of means of production will increase by 65% to 69%, while the production of consumer goods will increase by 33% to 38%.

In the Fourth Five-Year Plan, agriculture occupies a primary position in the overall development of the national economy.

First, because our country is still an agricultural-industrial country, and agriculture is one of the main sectors of the national economy that has a direct bearing on our people. Agriculture produces the grain that people need, which is the basis of people's lives. In addition to grain, agriculture also produces other food needed by people; produces raw materials for light industry and food industry (accounting for about half of our country's total industrial output) and other industrial sectors; and produces products to increase exports. Now, agricultural production accounts for a large proportion of social production. Under the current conditions, it is impossible to ensure the development of the entire national economy without developing agricultural production.

Second, because under the conditions of imperialist and revisionist economic blockade, and in the current and possible future international situation, agricultural production, especially the self-sufficiency of people's grain, has special significance and is the primary factor in coping with various situations.

Third, because in the Fourth Five-Year Plan, agricultural production will develop at a faster pace than industrial production, which requires us to concentrate our main efforts on solving this task that has a direct bearing on people's lives.

Fourth, because as Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "The line our Party follows is: we should not only have a developed industry but also an advanced agriculture; to make our country's economy a strong and independent economy, we must walk on two legs, relying on both industry and agriculture. This is a major and principled issue of special significance to our country."

During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, the total agricultural output will increase by 41% to 46% compared to the Third Five-Year Plan, with an average annual increase of about 11.5%. By 1970, the total agricultural output will increase by 71% to 76% compared to 1965.

The most important and primary task of our agriculture is to rapidly increase the production of grain and potatoes. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, the total grain production will increase by 62% to 67% compared to the Third Five-Year Plan. By 1970, the grain production will increase by more than onefold compared to 1965.

If all working peasants and the entire people correctly understand the issue of grain self-sufficiency from a political standpoint, then the task of increasing grain and potato production will certainly be successfully completed. In our international environment of building socialism, the principle of self-reliance has decisive significance for the fate of socialism. However, everyone should fully understand that if we do not first complete the task of grain self-sufficiency, then we cannot well implement the principle of self-reliance.

During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, as in previous Five-Year Plans, our Party will still improve the welfare of the people based on the real possibilities of our country. With the growth of social production, the national income in 1970 will increase by 45% to 50% compared to 1965.

Shehu said that the Fourth Five-Year Plan presents a grand prospect for our country. The realization of this grand program requires us to fully mobilize the strength and energy of the working class, laboring peasants, and intellectuals of our country. The smooth implementation of the plan first requires us to follow the Party's teachings on improving work methods and work styles. In this regard, the main tasks before us are:

First, we must view all our activities and problems with a political perspective and emphasize politics. This is the main condition for ensuring the completion of our country's economic and cultural development plans. Proletarian politics and proletarian ideology must command the economy, command business, technology, schools, art, culture, and every activity in our lives.

Second, we must hold high the banner of proletarian class struggle and must persistently struggle not only against open enemies but also against all manifestations of bourgeois ideology and actions and manifestations that harm socialist interests. Class struggle is not a matter of one or five years but will continue to exist throughout the historical period of socialist construction. It is the driving force of socialist development.

Third, we must rely on the masses and bravely fight against bureaucratism and all manifestations of bureaucratism in economic and Party and government organs.

Fourth, we must persistently implement the Marxist-Leninist principle of self-reliance. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the main determining factor in social development is internal factors. Self-reliance means primarily relying on the creative power of our people; it means correctly evaluating the material resources of the country, exploring and more rationally utilizing these resources for socialist construction; it means concentrating our main efforts on the specific conditions of our country to vigorously develop agricultural production, primarily grain production; it means seriously studying and summarizing the experiences of our people and cadres in all fields, making them the wealth of all working people.

Fifth, we must continue to comprehensively improve socialist production relations.

Sixth, we must take "more, better, faster" as the starting point for production and construction.

Seventh, we must hold high the Party's banner of "one hand holding a pickaxe, one hand holding a gun to build socialism," further and continuously carry forward the revolutionary spirit, and bravely overcome all difficulties that may be encountered in the process of advancement.

Comrade Shehu said that the revolutionary practice of our socialist construction completely proves the correctness of the Party's battle cry of "one hand holding a pickaxe, one hand holding a gun to build socialism." Now, when we are implementing the great tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the lofty patriotic task of all communists, laborers, and the entire people of Albania is to deeply engrave the great spirit and thought embodied in this battle cry of the Party in our hearts. This requires us to live, work, and fight with the demeanor and posture of revolutionaries at all times and in all places. We should focus our main attention on proletarian politics, always be guided by proletarian spirit and ideology, rely on the people, arm the people with the Party's teachings and Marxist-Leninist thought, and, as in the past, make them the conscious and loyal executors of the Party's line and policies, firmly holding the pickaxe and gun in both hands.

During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, with the development of our economy and culture, we will further strengthen national defense and further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must strengthen the army, which is required by our international environment. We must always be fully prepared for battle to defend our homeland, freedom, and sovereignty in any situation.

Shehu said that the correct Marxist-Leninist leadership of our Party headed by its founder and leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha; the iron-like unity of the people around the Party; the creative genius, selfless labor, revolutionary spirit, and socialist patriotism of our people; our continuously developing productive forces and continuously improving socialist production relations; our proletarian dictatorship; and the historical process leading to the death of imperialism, the burial of revisionism, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism—these are the guarantees of our task completion.

Comrade Shehu said that the existence of an indestructible revolutionary force, the great country of 700 million people, and its activities under the banner of Marxism-Leninism are a great fortune for international communism and the workers' movement and for all humanity. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, great China has become a strong and indestructible bastion of socialism.

On the international stage, the People's Republic of China is a powerful force of socialism, a staunch defender of the oppressed peoples struggling for freedom and independence against imperialism and world reactionary forces, and a steadfast fighter against modern revisionism and for the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

Recently, the great achievements of the People's Republic of China in missile and nuclear weapon tests have brought joy to all true Marxist-Leninists and oppressed peoples of the world, because the strengthening of China's national defense forces is the strengthening of the defensive capabilities of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, anti-imperialist forces, and anti-revisionist forces. Our Party and people, like celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the People's Republic of China, sincerely congratulate the great achievements of our brotherly Chinese people. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the People's Republic of China is developing vigorously under the Marxist-Leninist teachings and thoughts of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. The purpose of this revolution is to eliminate any possibility of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China, to ensure the complete and thorough victory of the socialist road in China, and to comprehensively strengthen the People's Republic of China.

Shehu finally said that the revolutionary measures taken by the Party in recent times are a further continuation of the Party's general line of Marxism-Leninism. These measures mark the beginning of a new stage of deeper development of our revolution, will block the channels for the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country, and ensure the continuation of our revolution. Our Party regards these as its most important historical tasks. The Party is determined to carry out this work to the end, so that our country will never produce revisionism and will never see the restoration of capitalism in the present and future.

Our Party, as a Marxist-Leninist party, is entering its 26th year of life. It has never been as strong, as united, and as determined as it is now. It will thoroughly fulfill its mission as the vanguard of the working class of our country and as a steadfast fighter at the forefront of the international communist movement.

Armed with the general line of the Congress, we will overcome all obstacles, conquer all difficulties, advance along the path determined on the day our glorious Party was born here 25 years ago, advance along the path of uncompromising struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, advance along the path of freedom and independence, and advance along the path of socialism and communism.

    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上
    谢胡同志作关于第四个五年计划指示的报告
    新华社地拉那六日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志，五日在党的第五次代表大会上作了关于一九六六——一九七○年阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国发展经济和文化的第四个五年计划指示的报告。
    谢胡同志在报告中说，党的第五次代表大会是在我党革命生活二十五周年的时候举行的。在这二十五年中，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的我党在革命道路上天才、勇敢地领导阿尔巴尼亚人民从胜利走向胜利。
    我党在二十五年中所取得的辉煌胜利不是轻而易举得来的，而是通过国内、国际范围的激烈和艰巨的阶级斗争取得的。我们粉碎了多少帝国主义的阴谋！击败了多少铁托修正主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者集团的阴谋诡计！我国人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的党的正确领导下，顶住了它们，粉碎了它们，战胜了它们。
    今天，我党以胜利者的姿态迎接第五次代表大会。从党的第四次代表大会到第五次代表大会将近六年的时间，对我们党和我国人民来说，是民族解放斗争以后最困难的时期。
    大家知道，党的第四次代表大会通过的第三个五年计划本来还有苏联和其他修正主义国家在代表大会之前同意提供给我们的贷款。但是，在我党第四次代表大会以后，赫鲁晓夫及其走狗立即取消这些贷款，组织了全面的封锁，把意识形态领域内的分歧扩大到国家关系和经济关系中。赫鲁晓夫甚至还断绝了同我国的外交关系，抢走了我们的军舰，撕毁了一切协议，甚至伙同南斯拉夫修正主义者、希腊反动派和美国第六舰队对阿尔巴尼亚组织了臭名昭著的阴谋活动，企图改变阿尔巴尼亚的形势，使之有利于他们。
    但是，他们没有考虑到我们党和我国人民团结的威力，没有考虑到我们敢于迎接各种困难，克服一切障碍，宁死不屈和不受奴役的革命决心。
    今天，我们可以向第五次代表大会汇报，尽管遭到修正主义和帝国主义的野蛮封锁，但是，我国第三个五年计划并没有像赫鲁晓夫所预料的那样遭到失败，而是基本上胜利地完成了，这是我国人民和我们党的一个巨大的历史性胜利。
    在修正主义全面封锁我们的严重形势下，中华人民共和国毫不犹豫地尽自己的一切可能援助了我们。这个援助对我们来说是非常宝贵的。我国人民和我们党永远不会忘记在危急的时候朋友给予我们的援助，并且将永世感激七亿兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志。
    关于一九六一——一九六五年发展国家经济和文化的第三个五年计划的任务的执行结果
    谢胡同志在论述第三个五年计划的执行结果时说，第一、在修正主义和帝国主义野蛮封锁的艰难条件下，我们在建设社会主义物质技术基础方面又向前迈出了重要的一步。今天，工业的物质技术基础不仅保证工业生产的进一步发展，而且有助于国民经济的其他部门完成第四个五年计划。
    第二、我们在把我国由一个农业工业国变为工业农业国的道路上胜利地迈出了重要的第一步。第三个五年计划的工业总产值比第二个五年计划增长百分之六十二。工业生产在工农业总产值中的比重（按一九六六年价格计算），从一九六○年的百分之四十八点四增至一九六五年的百分之五十六点六。
    第三、尽管修正主义的封锁和五年计划头两年的旱灾和水灾造成了巨大的困难，但是农业生产仍然以比第二个五年计划期间更快的速度增长。第三个五年计划期间农业生产平均每年增长速度为百分之六点四。
    第四、劳动群众的物质福利水平有所提高，特别是在农村。
    谢胡同志接着谈到了工业、农业、投资和建筑、运输和邮电事业、提高人民福利和发展文化等五个方面的任务的完成情况。
    谢胡指出，一九六五年工业总产值比一九六○年增长百分之三十九，比一九三八年增长三十三点八倍，也就是说，在一九六五年不到十一天的时间内就能完成一九三八年的工业产值。
      第三个五年计划的农业总产值比第二个五年计划增加了百分之二十九，一九六五年的农业产值比一九六○年增加了百分之三十六。同过去的几个五年计划相比，这是我国农业生产至今所达到的最大的增长率。
    由于贯彻了党的第四次代表大会所确定的农业法典七条基本准则，由于播种面积的扩大和农作物单位面积产量的提高，一九六五年比一九六○年多生产粮食百分之五十一，大米——百分之一百二十，棉花——百分之五十三。
    第三个五年计划的投资比第二个五年计划增加了百分之四十三。一九六五年建筑量比一九六○年增加了百分之五十三，超额完成计划的百分之十四。
    伟大的中国人民给了我们巨大的和非常及时的援助，在最短的时间内向我们提供了设计、机器、设备和材料。优秀的中国专家也给了我们十分宝贵的帮助，他们同我国专家进行了兄弟般的、国际主义的合作，克服建设新工业项目中的一切困难。这对帝国主义者和以赫鲁晓夫为首的修正主义者是一个沉重打击。第三个五年计划期间，共有四百三十个经济项目和社会文化设施建成并投入生产和使用，而党的第四次代表大会确定的是四百个。这些项目的绝大部分是由我国的工程师、专家和建筑劳动者自己设计的，其中包括修正主义者掌权的国家本来已经开始为我们设计或者答应为我们设计的那些项目。
    谢胡说，修正主义者对我国采取了野蛮的措施，梦想使我们的生活水平降低，消费品的价格高涨，人民经济情况恶化。但是，恰恰相反，在修正主义者统治的国家里，物价大幅度上涨。而在我国，物价不仅没有提高，反而降低了。
    谢胡强调说，在我们所生活、工作和战斗的国内外形势下，这些成绩确实是伟大的，它们是我们为胜利地完成第四个五年计划发起总攻势的相当良好的起点。
    党的第五次代表大会关于一九六六——一九七○年阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国发展经济和文化的第四个五年计划的指示
    谢胡说，第四个五年计划的指示草案，是在全面建成社会主义社会的道路上，以更快的步伐向前迈进的宏伟纲领。
    第四个五年计划的主要任务是：保障我国生产力的进一步发展，以加速建成社会主义物质技术基础。要实现这一点，将继续进行国家社会主义工业化，通过更充分地利用现有生产能力和建筑新项目来提高工业生产；首先通过农业的进一步集约化，集中力量更迅速地发展农业，特别是粮食生产。在提高社会生产的基础上，提高人民的物质福利和文化水平，加强祖国的国防力量。与此同时，在正确的革命道路上，进一步改善社会主义生产关系，逐步缩小城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别；深入进行思想和文化领域内的社会主义革命；加强无产阶级专政，加强人民同党的团结；同国内外敌人进行尖锐的毫不调和的阶级斗争；在各个领域不断促进社会主义革命。
    第四个五年计划的主要任务决定了这个计划的主要特点：
    第一、第四个五年计划在工农业生产发展速度上有了重要转折。如果说，第三个五年计划工农业总产值每年平均递增百分之八点六（计划原订为百分之六点七）的话，那么，第四个五年计划的递增速度将提高到百分之十左右。
    第二、第四个五年计划是一个缩小工农业之间不平衡现象的五年计划，它保证农业生产的增长不仅大于第三个五年计划，而且其增长速度高于工业生产增长速度。
    第三、第四个五年计划将是一个改进工业生产结构的五年计划，它规定优先发展生产资料的生产部门，特别是采矿工业的发展规模比第三个五年计划更大。
    第四、第四个五年计划的投资大，百分之八十的投资将用到生产部门，以提高生产力和社会生产。第四个五年计划投资总额等于第一个五年计划和第三个五年计划投资总额的总和。
    第五、和第三个五年计划相比，第四个五年计划期间国民收入将有很大增长。
    第六、第四个五年计划是改进文化教育质量的五年计划，是根据马克思列宁主义学说深入进行思想文化革命的五年计划；是进一步加紧进行斗争，堵塞在我国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的渠道的五年计划。
    谢胡在谈到第四个五年计划提高工、农业生产的任务时指出，一九七○年工农业总产值将比一九六五年增长百分之五十八至六十三。
    在五年计划期间，工业总产值将增长百分之五十至五十四，每年平均增长百分之八点七左右。生产资料的生产增加百分之六十五至六十九，而消费资料的生产增加百分之三十三至三十八。
    在第四个五年计划中，农业在整个国民经济发展中占有主要的地位。
    第一、因为我国还是一个农业工业国，而农业又是国民经济中对我国人民具有切身意义的主要部门之一。农业生产人民需要的粮食，它是人民的生活基础。除了粮食外，农业还要生产人民所需的其他食品；生产轻工业和食品工业（占我国工业生产总值一半左右）以及其他工业部门所需的原料；生产增加出口的产品。现在，农业生产在社会生产中占有较大的比重。在目前条件下，不发展农业生产，就不可能保证整个国民经济的发展。
    第二、因为在帝国主义和修正主义经济封锁的条件下，在目前国际形势及其今后可能发展的情况下，农业生产，特别是人民的粮食自给，具有特殊的意义，是应付各种形势的首要因素。
    第三、因为在第四个五年计划中，农业生产将以比工业生产更快的速度发展，这就要求我们更集中主要的精力来解决这个对人民生活具有切身意义的任务。
    第四、因为正如恩维尔·霍查所说的：“我们党所遵循的路线是：我们不仅应该有一个发达的工业，而且应该有一个先进的农业；为了使我国经济成为强大独立的经济，必须两条腿走路，既依靠工业，也依靠农业。这是一个对我国具有特殊意义的、原则性的重大问题。”
    第四个五年计划期间，农业总产值将比第三个五年计划增长百分之四十一到四十六，每年平均增长百分之十一点五左右。一九七○年农业总产值将比一九六五年增加百分之七十一到七十六。
    我国农业最重要的和最主要的任务是迅速增加粮食和土豆生产。第四个五年计划期间粮食总产量将比第三个五年计划增加百分之六十二至六十七。一九七○年粮食产量将比一九六五年增加一倍多。
    如果全体劳动农民和全体人民从政治上正确地理解粮食自给的问题，那么，增加粮食和土豆生产的任务必将胜利地完成。在我们建设社会主义的国际环境下，自力更生的原则对社会主义的命运具有决定性的意义。但是，大家应该很好地懂得，如果不首先完成粮食自给的任务，那么，就不能很好地执行自力更生的原则。
    第四个五年计划期间，和前几个五年计划一样；我们党还是根据我国的现实可能来提高人民的福利。随着社会生产的增长，一九七○年国民收入将比一九六五年增长百分之四十五至五十。
    谢胡说，第四个五年计划为我国展示了宏伟的前景。这一宏伟纲领的实现要求我们充分动员我国工人阶级、劳动农民和人民知识分子的全部力量和精力。计划的顺利完成，首先要求我们遵循党关于改进工作方法和工作作风的教导。在这方面，摆在我们面前的主要任务是：
    第一、我们要用政治眼光来看待我们的全部活动和所有问题，突出政治。这是保证完成我国发展经济和文化计划的主要条件。无产阶级政治和无产阶级思想必须统帅经济，统帅业务、技术、学校、艺术、文化和我们生活中的每一个活动。
    第二、必须高举无产阶级的阶级斗争的旗帜，必须始终不渝地不仅同公开的敌人进行斗争，而且同各种资产阶级思想的表现进行斗争，反对各种损害社会主义利益的表现和行动。阶级斗争不是一年、五年的事，而在整个社会主义建设的历史时期中都将继续存在。它是社会主义发展的动力。
    第三、有力地依靠群众，勇敢地同经济机关和党政机关中的官僚主义的歪风邪气和任何官僚主义的苗头作斗争。
    第四、坚持不懈地执行马克思列宁主义的自力更生原则。马克思列宁主义教育我们，社会发展的主要决定性因素是内部因素。自力更生意味着首先依靠我国人民的创造力；意味着正确估价国家的物质资源，发掘和更加合理地利用这些资源来进行社会主义建设；意味着在我国的具体条件下集中主要精力，大力发展农业生产，首先发展粮食生产；意味着要认真研究和总结我国人民和我国干部在各方面所取得的经验，使之成为全体劳动人民的财富。
    第五、继续全面改善社会主义的生产关系。
    第六、必须以“更多、更好、更省”地进行生产和建设的原则为出发点。
    第七、更高地举起党的“一手拿镐、一手拿枪建设社会主义”的战斗旗帜，进一步和不断地发扬革命精神，勇敢地克服前进中可能遇到的一切困难。
    谢胡同志说，我国社会主义建设的革命实践，完全证明了党的“一手拿镐、一手拿枪建设社会主义”的战斗口号的正确性。现在，当我们正在执行第四个五年计划的伟大任务的时候，阿尔巴尼亚所有共产党人、劳动者和全体人民的崇高的爱国主义任务，就是把党在这个战斗口号中所体现的伟大精神和思想深深地刻在自己的心里。这就要求我们无论何时何地都要以革命者的风度和姿态生活、工作和战斗。我们应当把主要的注意力放到无产阶级政治上，永远以无产阶级精神和思想为指导，依靠人民，以党的教导和马克思列宁主义思想武装人民，并且和以往一样，使他们成为党的路线和政策的自觉和忠实的执行者，两手紧紧地握住镐和枪。
    在第四个五年计划期间，随着我国经济和文化的发展，我们要进一步加强国防，进一步加强无产阶级专政。我们要加强军队，这是我们所处的国际环境所要求的。我们要时刻作好充分的战斗准备，以便在任何情况下都能保卫我们的祖国、自由和主权。
    谢胡说，以其创始人和领导者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的我们党的马克思列宁主义的正确领导；人民在党的周围的钢铁般的团结；我国人民的创造天才、忘我劳动、革命干劲和社会主义爱国主义精神；我们不断发展的生产力和不断完善的社会主义生产关系；我们的无产阶级专政；导致帝国主义死亡、导致埋葬修正主义和导致马克思列宁主义胜利的事态发展的世界历史进程——这些就是我们完成任务的保证。
    谢胡同志说，坚不可摧的革命力量、七亿人口的伟大中国的存在和它高举马克思列宁主义旗帜所进行的活动，对国际共产主义和工人运动以及全人类来说都是莫大的幸运。伟大的人民中国在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，成了社会主义的强大和坚不可摧的堡垒。
    在国际舞台上，人民中国是社会主义的强大力量，是为争取自由和独立、反对帝国主义和世界反动势力而进行斗争的被压迫人民的坚强保卫者，是反对现代修正主义、捍卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性的坚定战士。
    最近，人民中国在发射导弹核武器试验方面所取得的巨大成就，使所有真正的马克思列宁主义者和世界被压迫民族感到高兴，因为伟大中国的国防力量的增强，就是马克思列宁主义、社会主义、反帝国主义力量、反修正主义力量的防御能力的增强。我们党和我国人民正像祝贺人民中国的无产阶级文化大革命一样，衷心祝贺兄弟的中国人民的这一巨大成就。人民中国的无产阶级文化大革命正在按照中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的教导和思想而蓬勃发展着。这一革命的目的是消灭在中国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的任何可能性，确保社会主义道路在中国的彻底胜利和全面加强中华人民共和国。
    谢胡最后说，党在最近时期采取的革命化措施，是党的马克思列宁主义总路线的进一步继续，这些措施标志着我国革命开始了一个更加深入发展的新阶段，将堵塞在我国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的渠道，保证我国革命的继续进行。我们党把这些看作是自己最主要的历史任务。党决心把这一工作进行到底，使我国现在和将来永远不会产生修正主义和出现资本主义复辟。
    我们党作为一个马克思列宁主义的党，正在进入它的生活的第二十六年。它从来没有像现在这样强大，从来没有像现在这样团结，从来没有像现在这样坚定，它将彻底完成作为我国工人阶级的先锋队和作为站在国际共产主义运动前列的坚定战士的使命。
    用代表大会的总路线武装起来的我们，将克服一切阻碍，战胜一切困难，沿着二十五年前我们光荣的党在这里诞生的那一天所确定的道路前进，沿着同国内外敌人进行毫不妥协的斗争的道路，沿着自由和独立的道路，沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路前进。（附图片）
