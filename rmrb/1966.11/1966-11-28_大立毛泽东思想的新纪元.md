On November 25 and 26, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, in the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing—inspected once again the 2.5 million revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country. This was the largest-scale inspection since August 18 this year, when Chairman Mao inspected over 11 million cultural revolutionaries eight times.

In the past few months, the tens of millions of cultural revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought have written a new chapter in the history of proletarian revolution with their brilliant revolutionary practice:

Today's China is a China that upholds Mao Zedong Thought.

Today's world is a world where Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to uphold Mao Zedong Thought.

The new era of upholding Mao Zedong Thought has begun!

There is a new world only with Mao Zedong Thought

In these few months that have shaken the world, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has been extraordinarily swift and unstoppable, creating immortal achievements. There has never been such a large-scale and profound revolution in history!

Millions of revolutionary masses have surged from all directions to the side of their most beloved leader Chairman Mao. Over the past three months, Chairman Mao has met with revolutionary masses eight times. The unity between the leader and the masses is unprecedented in revolutionary history.

Each meeting is a triumphant inspection of upholding Mao Zedong Thought.

Each meeting is a solemn oath to uphold Mao Zedong Thought.

On Tiananmen Square and the wide avenues of Beijing, there have never been so many spirited young revolutionaries holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing and reciting; there have never been so many teary eyes looking up at the red sun in their hearts.

Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in a word, to uphold Mao Zedong Thought."

Today, the Chinese people and the people of the world are increasingly seeing the profound significance of this great revolution to uphold Mao Zedong Thought.

This is a great revolution concerning the success or failure of the proletarian revolution! This is a great revolution concerning the path of socialist countries! Only by upholding Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out the socialist revolution on the ideological and cultural fronts to the end can we build our great motherland into an indestructible proletarian iron fortress.

Upholding Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest need of our people and the urgent need of the revolutionary people of the world.

The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" on Tiananmen Square have shaken the world; the oaths to "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" have shaken the world.

Revolutionary students and teachers from the old revolutionary base in Shaanbei sang, "The East is red, the sun is rising, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." They came to Beijing, to Tiananmen. More than twenty years ago, the old poor peasant Li Youyuan from Shaanbei first sang the praises of "The East is Red." Over the years, this song has spread throughout China, throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and throughout the world. Now, as they sing this song, their hearts are surging. They said excitedly, "In the past, we relied on Mao Zedong Thought to quickly turn all of China red; today, as long as we and the people of the world together uphold Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely quickly win a red world!"

Soldiers from the anti-revisionist front, standing on the reviewing stand and walking in front of Tiananmen, whether they are descendants of poor herdsmen who have lived by the Ili River for generations or students who have just been ordered back to the country by the Soviet revisionist leadership, they look up at Chairman Mao with tears in their eyes and shout, "Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!" They know best that with Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this cultural revolution, China will never become revisionist, and the mountains and rivers will never change color. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest revolutionary mass movement in history. Only the greatest proletarian revolutionary, Chairman Mao, has the courage and determination to mobilize the revolutionary masses and thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism. They cannot help but sing in their hearts: With the brightest red sun in their hearts, walking on the broad road of the cultural revolution, socialism and communism will last for ten thousand years...

In various places around the world, all revolutionary people praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as a great creation in human history; they cheer that Chairman Mao has revealed to billions of revolutionary people the inevitable law of historical development. An African friend said, "The Chinese Cultural Revolution is a great creation in world history. Its victorious progress has indisputably declared to the world that people who want to maintain revolutionary youth must carry out this great revolution in the ideological realm." A Greek friend said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has accelerated the progress of the world revolution and is the guarantee of the glorious achievements and victories of the world proletarian revolution." A responsible person from the National Liberation Front of Ceylon pointed out, "What the Chinese people are doing in this revolution today is exactly what the proletariat of the whole world will have to do in their advance towards socialism in the future."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China declares to the world: Victory will surely belong to the revolutionary people who uphold Mao Zedong Thought, and a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation will surely be born!

The Great Popularization of Mao Zedong Thought

"We want the sky to be the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, the earth to be the earth of Mao Zedong Thought, and people to be people armed with Mao Zedong Thought." This is the bold declaration of the revolutionary young people to uphold Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also a vivid portrayal of the spiritual face of our revolutionary people today.

Millions of revolutionary students and teachers have formed revolutionary liaison teams and Long March teams, traveling all over the country. They are the fighting teams, learning teams, and propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, spreading Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go. The entire country, both urban and rural, is a large classroom of Mao Zedong Thought and a large examination hall of Mao Zedong Thought; all the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary students and teachers are both students and teachers; the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are both the achievements of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the living textbooks for learning Mao Zedong Thought. On the vast land of our great motherland, Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today; people's spiritual appearance has never been as brilliant as it is today; the material force transformed from Mao Zedong Thought has never been as immeasurable as it is today!

Why has Mao Zedong Thought been so quickly popularized and deeply rooted in people's hearts? The fundamental reason is that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has truly mobilized the broad masses, further awakened the revolutionary consciousness of the masses, further enhanced the self-awareness of the masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and made the study and application of Chairman Mao's works truly a great mass movement.

In our country, tens of millions of revolutionary people love, believe in, and worship Chairman Mao without limit. They clearly know that it is Chairman Mao who has raised Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, and they have an extremely deep class feeling for Chairman Mao's books. They say, "Food can be skipped, sleep can be skipped, but Chairman Mao's books cannot be skipped." "The head can be cut off, blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned." "The sun in the sky is the brightest, but it is not as bright as the brilliance of Chairman Mao's works. The sun can only illuminate the body, but Chairman Mao's works can illuminate the heart."

In front of Tiananmen, there stands a group of future red pilots—the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team" of 83 members from a certain aviation preparatory school of the Air Force. They walked 700 miles to visit Chairman Mao. They climbed mountains and waded through rivers, braving wind and rain. The mountains are not as high as their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, and the waters are not as deep as their feelings for reading Chairman Mao's books. They study the quotations of Chairman Mao, walking, learning, and applying along the way. They say, "We walk to temper our red hearts and willpower; red hearts and willpower come from Mao Zedong Thought. We will strive to study Chairman Mao's works and master Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, we will not lose our bearings in any storm, and we will be able to fly towards communism along the red route!"

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The great democracy of big debates, big-character posters, big criticisms, big discussions, and big liaison activities is a new form of Mao Zedong Thought combining with the broad masses, born in the revolutionary storm. Tens of millions of revolutionary masses learn in struggle and apply in struggle, the more they learn, the more energetic they become, promoting the great popularization of Mao Zedong Thought. This is another characteristic of the new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

A group of revolutionary students from Hebei who came to Chairman Mao's side used the phrase "A few months of cultural revolution is like reading political books for several years" to describe their gains from studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the cultural revolution.

In early June, when they were drafting the first big-character poster to expose the capitalist-roaders in power, some people had many concerns and were afraid of trouble. Chairman Mao's teaching of "Dare to cut off one's flesh to pull down the emperor" made them firm.

Soon they were attacked, and some people even slandered them as "rightists." At this time, they studied Chairman Mao's instruction: "Our comrades should see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." They persisted in the struggle and did not retreat.

After a counter-revolutionary revisionist was exposed, he talked about "good-hearted people doing bad things" and used sweet words to exonerate himself. They again studied Chairman Mao's theory of the unity of motive and effect in dialectical materialism and promptly exposed the enemy's sophistry.

The revolutionary young people said well, "Study for the revolution, learn in the revolution, the more you study, the more you love to study; apply for the revolution, apply in the revolution, the more you apply, the more you love to apply."

In our country, the cultural revolution touches the soul of every person, forcing people to uproot bourgeois ideology and plant proletarian ideology, overthrowing the old worldview of "Heaven will punish those who do not act for themselves" and establishing the new worldview of "selflessly serving others." The core issue of transforming the worldview, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, has been consciously placed before more and more people. This is also a characteristic of the great popularization of Mao Zedong Thought. Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune have become the vanguards of the broad revolutionary masses advancing on the road of ideological revolution.

"We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, taking the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' as our motto."

"We must regard ourselves as the motive force of the revolution and at the same time regard ourselves as the object of the revolution, constantly engage in self-criticism, and constantly reform ourselves."

"We must drive out the 'private' character from our home and establish the 'public' character in our home, settling down forever."

These are the revolutionary marches!

These are the strongest notes of the times!

Using Mao Zedong Thought to educate people, transform people, and arm people is opening a new era. In the cultural revolution, tens of millions of revolutionary masses take up the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, liberate themselves, and educate themselves. Mao Zedong Thought is being greatly popularized.

The warriors of the various Long March teams who accepted the inspection joyfully cheered the great popularization of Mao Zedong Thought. During their long march, they personally witnessed an unprecedented scale of learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought among the masses. In cities, in rural areas, under the sunlit land of the motherland, everywhere there are the resonant sounds of reading Chairman Mao's books, everywhere there are meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, everywhere there are songs composed for the quotations of Chairman Mao. The "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are carried by people and studied at any time. Everywhere is a red sea of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This is an educational force that no school can match, and a propaganda force that no propaganda team can match.

In the past few months, it is this unprecedented great revolutionary mass movement that has made Mao Zedong Thought greatly popularized and deeply rooted, opening a new era of the working people and peasants directly grasping Mao Zedong Thought!

Mao Zedong Thought Nurtures a New Generation

A new society needs new people to create it, to build socialism, and to build communism. It relies on selfless communists. In the past few months, the revolutionary young people who accepted Chairman Mao's inspection are rapidly growing into a new generation.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has placed his most ardent hopes on the youth. Now, the vigorous revolutionary youth carry this most ardent hope and bring the fruitful results of the cultural revolution to Chairman Mao's side. "The world belongs to you, it also belongs to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and are in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you." The song of this quotation resounds through Beijing. Those imperialist old men who always dream of China changing color in our next generation are now answered by our youth. They are changing, becoming redder and redder, becoming more revolutionary and more militant.

The revolutionary young people who accepted Chairman Mao's inspection shouted to the world:

"Revolution is rebellion, and the soul of Mao Zedong Thought is rebellion." "We must rebel against the bourgeoisie! Rebel against imperialism! Rebel against revisionism! Rebel against all ghosts and monsters! Rebel against all ideological remnants of the exploiting classes!"

"Are we too arrogant? We must be 'arrogant.' Chairman Mao said, 'Dung was once a feudal lord.' Revolutionaries take the world as their responsibility, how can they not be 'arrogant'?"

"Are we too extreme? To be honest, what you call not extreme is reformism, is 'peaceful transition.' This is an illusion! We must knock you down to the ground and step on you with one foot!"

"Revolutionaries are like the Monkey King, with a powerful magic stick, vast magical powers, and boundless magical powers. This is not something else, but the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought. We must wield the big stick, display magical powers, and use magical powers to turn the old world upside down and make people and horses fall!"

These "stormy" young people are fearless of heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods, and do what they say. They have dug out all the capitalist-roaders in power within the party and all the ghosts and monsters; they have exposed the accounts of changing heaven and the ill-gotten wealth of the old bloodsuckers. Each inspection has snowflake-like good news flying towards Tiananmen.

This is the young people reporting their achievements to Chairman Mao.

This is also the young people reporting how they are rapidly growing to Chairman Mao.

No wonder all revolutionaries cheer for the Red Guards. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers see such reliable successors and vigorous young shoots behind them, how can they not cheer!

No wonder the spokesman of the reactionary class, Pope Paul VI, helplessly admits that the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are "a symbol of death, not a symbol of life" to them. Indeed, this is the symbol of the final annihilation of domestic and foreign class enemies, and all their illusions have been completely shattered!

The communist worldview of selflessly serving others is deeply rooted in the souls of a new generation. Cai Yongxiang, the loyal defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is a representative of the rapidly growing new generation. He is only eighteen years old and has been in the army for only eight months, but because he upholds Mao Zedong Thought, transforms his worldview, and "seizes the day," he has quickly grown into a communist warrior in the cultural revolution. Now, countless Cai Yongxiang-like warriors are growing.

Just among the revolutionary masses who accepted Chairman Mao's inspection, another song of communist heroism has spread: Recently, the two young daughters of an old worker from the Capital Steel Ironworks fell into a river. The river was deep and the water was swift, and they were about to be swept away by the current. A female student who was passing by immediately took off her cotton coat and jumped into the icy-cold river to rescue them. The surging river carried her more than a hundred meters away. Another male student who was passing by saw this and also jumped into the river to save people. Later, with the help of the community members, they quickly rescued the two young girls. The Capital Steel Ironworks held a "Learning from the New Communists" conference, and many workers felt proud to have such good successors and praised the revolutionary spirit of selflessly serving others shown by the young people.

In the Long March, tempering oneself, and succeeding in the Long March is the loud slogan of many young people. They know: Only in the masses, in struggle, and in practice can Mao Zedong Thought truly and rapidly become one's soul, and only then can the "public" character be firmly established in one's soul. On the reviewing stand, a group of vigorous female Long March team members from the coast of the Yellow Sea were excitedly discussing their gains from the Long March before accepting Chairman Mao's inspection. They said: Today, we have taken the first step of the Long March. We will follow the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, walk the path of the old Red Army, and succeed in the Long March. Pigs cannot give birth to thousand-mile horses, and flowerpots cannot nurture thousand-year-old pines; only the Long March can produce thousand-mile horses, and only dangerous peaks can nurture thousand-year-old pines. In the first few days of the Long March, they had not walked far, but their feet were already blistered. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on overcoming difficulties and said to each other: Chairman Mao said to overcome all difficulties, this is not even one difficulty, can we not overcome it? Besides, the Red Army wounded climbed over the snow mountains, what are a few small blisters? They deeply felt from this that fearing hardship and not fearing hardship is a struggle between two worldviews. As long as one thinks of "me," one cannot take half a step; as long as one thinks of "public," one can march and charge forward. Facing Tiananmen, they expressed their determination to Chairman Mao: They will be Long Marchers for life, walk the Long March path, and succeed in the Long March, carrying the socialist revolution to the end!

Wang Jingwen, the former political instructor of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," sent his daughter Wang Nengju a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with the words on the cover page: "To grow, always follow the party; to make progress, always study Chairman Mao's works." She was deeply moved and regarded Chairman Mao's book as her lifeline. Once, she heard someone say that the future of youth depends on studying, and going to university is the main road. She also had some thoughts and felt it made sense. But she compared it with Chairman Mao's teachings and immediately realized that it was the "private" character at work. Why, when faced with a matter, did she first think of personal gain, only think of her own future, and not think of the future of the party and the people? She immediately copied a passage from Wang Jie's diary into her own diary to criticize herself, requiring herself to answer questions like Wang Jie: "What is the ideal? Revolution is the ideal. What is the future? The revolutionary cause is the future. What is happiness? Serving the people is happiness." After accepting Chairman Mao's inspection with this book of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," she decided to better transform herself.

The new generation surpasses the old,
The world is advancing.

The new generation nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought is growing, and they are the future and hope of the proletarian revolution. With such red successors, our socialist mountains and rivers will surely remain red for thousands of generations! Let us cheer for the new generation to grow faster in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Learn from Chairman Mao, Learn, Learn Again

The loudest song is "The East is Red,"

The greatest leader is Mao Zedong!

This is the voice of the revolutionary young people who accepted the inspection, this is the voice of the Chinese people, this is the voice of the revolutionary people of the world!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that you personally initiated and led, you have met with us time and time again, guiding us, removing obstacles, and adding strength.

You have summed up the experience and lessons of the international communist movement, leading seven hundred million people into a new stage of socialist revolution.

You have supported the big-character poster of Comrade Nie Yuanzi and six others, turning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into a prairie fire.

You have formulated the proletarian revolutionary line, declaring the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line.

You have worn a red armband, becoming the supreme commander of the Red Guards, this revolutionary organization that has shocked the world.

You have instructed us: "You should care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!"

You have expressed to us: "I firmly support you!"

You have highly evaluated our revolutionary actions: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological transformation of the people of the whole country."

You have taught us: "You should put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better."

You have grasped the new thing of big liaison activities, pushing the cultural revolution to a new high...

Where is the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time? He is by our side, in front of our eyes, and he is our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao is always with us revolutionary masses, fully trusting the masses, sharing our fate, breathing together, and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice has set the most brilliant example for all party comrades, for all the people of the country, and for the youth.

Revolutionary students and teachers from Hunan Xiangtan recalled the unforgettable year of 1927. At that time, when the reactionaries slandered the peasant movement as a "hooligan movement" and denounced it as "very bad," it was Chairman Mao who went deep into the countryside and firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary masses, praising them as "revolutionary vanguards" and cheering their revolutionary actions as "very good"!

From Wang Guanzhang in Hebei Zunhua Jianming Commune to the side of Chairman Mao, revolutionary students and teachers recalled the agricultural cooperativization movement ten years ago. At that time, right-opportunists carried out so-called "firm contraction" of agricultural cooperatives, and Chairman Mao severely criticized them and warned all party comrades: "We should cherish any small bit of socialist enthusiasm of the peasants and cadres and not frustrate it. We should share the fate and breathe together with the members and cadres of the cooperatives, and the cadres at the county, district, and township levels, and not frustrate their enthusiasm." It was at this time that Chairman Mao discovered Wang Guanzhang and twenty-three other poor peasants who started with three donkeys, highly evaluating their revolutionary spirit and praising them as the image of our entire country.

Ten years have passed, thirty-nine years have passed, Chairman Mao has always represented the greatest interests of the revolutionary masses, Chairman Mao has always been with the revolutionary masses, and Chairman Mao has always been heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. In today's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and respects the initiative of the masses, once again setting the most brilliant example for us. The young revolutionaries, with hearts full of reverence, expressed their determination to learn from their great leader, learn, learn again!

Learn from Chairman Mao, learn his great theory, learn his brilliant practice, this is the common resolve of the millions of revolutionary students and teachers who accepted the inspection. They said: Chairman Mao's theory is in his great works, we will study it for life, use it for life, and always act according to Chairman Mao's instructions; at the same time, Chairman Mao has a large amount of "works" that are not in books, this is his brilliant practice, we must learn from it. We will take Chairman Mao's great theory as our guide, take Chairman Mao's brilliant practice as our example, do as Chairman Mao says, and follow as Chairman Mao does!

A Long March team from Jiangsu Xuzhou did just that. In the 1,800-mile journey, they did not take the main roads but the mountain paths, did not stay in cities but in rural areas, and in everything they did, they used Chairman Mao's brilliant example to urge and inspire themselves. They insisted on eating, living, and working with the masses, regarding the masses as their teachers, and learning from the masses. One day, after walking more than fifty miles, they arrived at the Hebei Haihe Construction Site to work in the afternoon. When they were tired, they reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching of "going among the masses and being with the masses," thought of the scene of Chairman Mao sharing the fate and breathing together with the masses, and their bodies were filled with endless strength. They worked with the community members, sweated with them, sang songs of the quotations of Chairman Mao, and studied Chairman Mao's works. They received a profound education. When they accepted Chairman Mao's inspection, these revolutionary young people deeply felt: Learning from Chairman Mao is to go among the masses, be a humble student of the masses, and wholeheartedly serve the people for life!

Under the support and encouragement of the great leader, more and more revolutionary young people began to walk and liaise, stepping out of the school, going to the classroom of society, and going to the great waves of class struggle to temper themselves. They are learning from the brilliant example of the great leader and advancing on the path indicated by the great leader!

Learn from the great revolutionary practice of the great leader Chairman Mao!

Learn from the great brilliant works of the great leader Chairman Mao!

The new era of upholding Mao Zedong Thought has begun!

Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!

专栏：

    大立毛泽东思想的新纪元
    十一月二十五日和二十六日，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京，又一次检阅了来自全国各地的二百五十万革命师生和红卫兵。这是今年八月十八日以来，毛主席连续八次检阅一千一百多万文化革命大军中，规模最大的一次。
    几个月来，毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万文化革命大军，用自己光辉的革命实践，为无产阶级革命历史写下了新的篇章：
    今日的中国，是大立毛泽东思想的中国。
    今日的世界，是毛泽东思想大放异彩的世界。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是大立毛泽东思想的大革命。
    大立毛泽东思想的新纪元开始了！
    有毛泽东思想才有新世界
    在这震撼世界的几个月里，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，其势迅猛异常，其锋锐不可挡，创立了不朽的丰功伟绩。历史上还没有过如此规模、如此深刻的大革命！
    千万革命群众，从五湖四海涌向自己最最敬爱的领袖毛主席身边，三个多月来，毛主席八次会见革命群众，领袖和群众如此心连心，这在革命历史上还是第一次。
    每一次接见，都是大立毛泽东思想的胜利检阅。
    每一次接见，都是大立毛泽东思想的庄严誓师。
    在天安门广场，在北京的宽敞大道上，从来没有过这么多英姿勃勃的革命小将，捧着《毛主席语录》，又读又唱；从来没有过这么多含着热泪的眼睛，仰望着自己心中的红太阳。
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志说，无产阶级文化大革命，“一句话，就是要大立毛泽东思想。”
    今天，中国人民和世界人民已经越来越清楚地看到，这场大立毛泽东思想的大革命，有着多么伟大深远的意义。
    这是关系到无产阶级革命成败的大革命！这是关系到社会主义国家走什么道路的大革命！只有大立毛泽东思想，把思想文化战线上的社会主义革命进行到底，才能把我们伟大的祖国建成一个永不变色的无产阶级的铁打江山。
    大立毛泽东思想，是我国人民的最大需要，也是世界革命人民的迫切需要。
    天安门前，“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声，震撼寰宇；“一定把大立毛泽东思想的文化大革命进行到底！”的宣誓声，震撼寰宇。
    陕北革命老根据地的革命师生高唱着：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”，来到北京，来到天安门。二十多年前，陕北老贫农李有源第一个唱出了《东方红》的颂歌，这些年来，这支歌已传遍中国，传遍亚非拉，传遍全世界。如今，他们唱着这支歌，更是心潮澎湃。他们激动地说：“过去，我们依靠毛泽东思想，迅速地红了全中国；今天，只要我们和世界人民一起大立毛泽东思想，就一定能迅速地赢得一个红世界！”
    来自反修前线的战士，站在观礼台上，走在天安门前，无论是世世代代住在伊犁河畔的贫苦牧民的后代，还是刚刚被苏联修正主义领导集团勒令回国的留学生，他们含着热泪仰望毛主席，高呼“万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们最清楚，有了毛主席亲自发动和领导这场文化大革命，中国就决不会像苏联那样出修正主义，江山就决不会变颜色。这场无产阶级文化大革命，是历史上最伟大的革命群众运动。只有最伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席，才能有这样的魄力，这样的决心，去发动革命群众，彻底挖掉修正主义根子。他们内心禁不住欢唱：胸怀最红最红的红太阳，走在文化革命的康庄大道上，社会主义共产主义万年长……。
    在世界各个地方，一切革命人民盛赞中国无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上的伟大创举；他们欢呼毛主席把这个历史发展的必然规律，揭示给亿万革命人民。一位非洲朋友说：“中国文化大革命是世界历史上的伟大创举。它的胜利进展已经无可辩驳地向世界宣告，人们要想永葆革命的青春，必须进行这一场意识形态领域内的伟大革命。”一位希腊朋友说：“在毛泽东主席领导下的无产阶级文化大革命，加速了世界革命的进程，是世界无产阶级革命的辉煌成就和胜利的保证。”锡兰民族解放阵线的一位负责人指出：“中国人民今天在这场革命中所做的，正是全世界无产阶级将来在他们向社会主义前进时要做的。”
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命向世界宣告：胜利一定属于大立毛泽东思想的革命人民，一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界必然会诞生！
    毛泽东思想的大普及
    “我们要叫天是毛泽东思想的天，地是毛泽东思想的地，人是毛泽东思想武装的人。”这是革命小将们大立毛泽东思想的豪言壮语，也是今天我国革命人民精神面貌的生动写照。
    数以千万计的革命师生组成的革命串连队、长征队，走遍祖国的各个角落，他们是毛泽东思想的战斗队、学习队、宣传队，走到哪里，把毛泽东思想传播到哪里。全国城乡，是一个毛泽东思想的大课堂，也是一个毛泽东思想的大考场；全国广大工农兵和革命师生，人人都是学生，又是先生；阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的实践，既是人们活学活用毛主席著作的成果，又是人们学习毛泽东思想的活教材。在我们的伟大祖国的广阔国土上，毛泽东思想从来没有像今天这样深入人心；人们的精神面貌从来没有像今天这样光彩夺目；毛泽东思想转化成的物质力量从来没有像今天这样不可估量！
    为什么毛泽东思想能这样的迅速普及？这样的深入人心？最根本的原因是无产阶级文化大革命，真正把广大群众发动起来了，进一步唤起了群众的革命觉悟，进一步提高了群众的活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性，使活学活用毛主席著作真正成了伟大的群众运动。
    在我国，亿万革命人民无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜毛主席，他们清楚地知道：是毛主席把马克思列宁主义提高到了一个崭新的阶段，对毛主席的书有着无比深厚的阶级感情。他们说：“饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席的书不能不读。”“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢。”“天上的太阳最明亮，不如毛主席著作的光辉明亮，太阳只能照亮身上，毛主席著作能照亮心房。”
    在天安门前，站着一群未来的红色飞行员——空军某航空预备学校“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”的八十三名队员，他们是步行七百里来看望毛主席的。他们爬山涉水，顶风冒雨。山大没有他们听毛主席话的决心大，水深没有他们读毛主席书的感情深。他们学毛主席语录，走一路，学一路，用一路。他们说：“我们走路就是炼红心，炼毅力；红心，毅力来源于毛泽东思想。我们要努力学习毛主席著作，努力掌握毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，遇到任何狂风暴雨，就不会迷失航向，就能保证我们沿着红色航线，飞向共产主义！”
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是活学活用毛主席著作最好的课堂。大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的大民主，是在革命暴风雨中应运而生的毛泽东思想与广大群众相结合的新形式。亿万革命群众，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，越学越有劲，促进了毛泽东思想的大普及，这是活学活用毛主席著作群众运动新高潮的又一个特色。
    一批从河北来到毛主席身边的革命师生，用“文化革命几个月，胜读数年政治书”的说法，来形容他们在文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作的收获。
    六月初，在酝酿写全校第一张揭发走资本主义道路当权派的大字报时，有的人顾虑重重，怕惹是非，毛主席的“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的教导，使他们坚定起来。
    不久他们遭到了围攻，某些人甚至诬蔑他们是“右派分子”。这时，他们学习了毛主席的指示：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”坚持斗争，毫不退缩。
    一个反革命修正主义分子遭到揭露以后，大谈“好心人办了坏事”，用甜言蜜语替自己开脱，他们又学习了毛主席关于辩证唯物主义的动机与效果统一的理论，及时戳穿了敌人的诡辩。
    革命的小将们说得好：“为革命斗争而学，在革命斗争中学，越学越爱学；为革命斗争而用，在革命斗争中用，越用越爱用。”
    在我国，文化大革命触及了每个人的灵魂，这就逼迫着人们拔资产阶级思想的根，扎无产阶级思想的根，打倒“人不为己天诛地灭”的旧世界观，树立“毫不利己专门利人”的新世界观。破私立公，这个改造世界观的核心问题，已经有越来越多的人自觉地把它摆在自己面前。这也是毛泽东思想大普及的一个特点。张思德、白求恩，成了广大革命群众在思想革命化大道上前进的标兵。
    “我们要努力活学活用毛主席著作，把‘老三篇’当作座右铭来学。”
    “我们要把自己当作革命的动力，同时又把自己当作革命的对象，经常自我批评，不断革自己的命。”
    “我们要抄‘私’字家，扫地出门，把‘公’字安下家，永远落户。”
    这些，是革命的进行曲！
    这些，是时代的最强音！
    用毛泽东思想来教育人，改造人，武装人，正在开创一个新纪元。在文化大革命中，亿万革命群众拿起毛泽东思想的锐利武器，自己解放自己，自己教育自己，毛泽东思想正在大普及。
    接受检阅的各路长征队的战士们，纵情欢呼毛泽东思想的大普及。他们在步行串连途中，亲眼看到了一个空前规模的学习与宣传毛泽东思想的群众运动。在城市，在农村，在阳光普照的祖国大地上，到处是读毛主席书的琅琅声，到处召开学习毛主席著作的讲用会，到处高唱为毛主席语录谱写的歌曲。《毛主席语录》，人们身上带，随时学起来。到处是《毛主席语录》的红色海洋。这是任何学校也不能比拟的教学力量，是任何宣传队伍也不能比拟的宣传力量。
    几个月来，就是这个史无前例的伟大的革命群众运动，使毛泽东思想大普及了，大深入了，开创了工农群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的新时代！
    毛泽东思想哺育一代新人
    新社会需要新人来创造，建设社会主义，建设共产主义，靠的就是一心为公的共产主义新人。几个月来，接受毛主席检阅的革命小将们，是正在迅速成长的一代新人。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，把最殷切的希望，寄托在青少年的身上。如今，意气风发的革命青少年肩负着这个最殷切的希望，带着文化大革命的丰硕成果，走到毛主席身边来了。“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”这支语录歌的歌声，响彻了北京城。那些整天做白日梦的帝国主义老爷们，不是总在幻想中国会在我们的下一代变色吗？现在我们的青年一代向他们回答了，他们是在变，是变得更红更红了，是变得更革命化、更战斗化了。
    接受毛主席检阅的革命小将们，吼声震天，他们向世界宣告：
    “革命就是造反，毛泽东思想的灵魂就是造反。”“我们就是要造资产阶级的反！造帝国主义的反！造修正主义的反！造一切牛鬼蛇神的反！造一切剥削阶级意识形态的反！”
    “说我们太狂妄吗？我们就是要‘狂妄’。毛主席说：“粪土当年万户侯”。革命者以天下为己任，不‘狂妄’怎么行呢？”
    “说我们太过分了吗？老实说，你们所谓不过分，就是改良主义，就是‘和平过渡’。这是妄想！我们就是要把你们打翻在地上，再踏上一只脚！”
    “革命者就是孙猴子，金箍棒厉害得很，神通广大得很，法力无边得很，这不是别的，正是战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想。我们就是要抡大棒、显神通、施法力，把旧世界打个天翻地覆，打个人仰马翻！”
    这些“狂飚”式的闯将们，天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕，说干就干。他们把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把一切牛鬼蛇神，一个个揪出来；把那些老吸血鬼的变天账和金银宝贝等不义之财拿出展览示众。每次检阅都有雪片似的报喜信飞向天安门。
    这是小将们在向毛主席汇报他们的战绩。
    也是小将们在向毛主席汇报他们怎样在飞速成长。
    难怪一切革命的人，都在向红卫兵欢呼。广大工农兵看到自己身后有这样坚强可靠的接班人，这样茁壮的幼苗，怎能不欢呼！
    难怪反动阶级的代言人罗马教皇保罗六世，无可奈何地供认，红卫兵的革命行动，对他们来说“是死亡的象征，而不是生命的象征。”确确实实这是国内外阶级敌人的最后灭亡的象征，敌人的一切幻想都彻底的破灭了！
    一心为公的共产主义人生观，正在一代新人的灵魂中扎下深根。无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者蔡永祥，是迅速成长的一代新人的代表。他刚满十八岁，刚入伍八个月，但由于他大立毛泽东思想，改造世界观，“只争朝夕”，他在文化大革命中很快地成长为一个共产主义战士。现在，无数的蔡永祥式的战士正在成长。
    就在接受毛主席检阅的革命群众中间，又传出了一曲舍己救人的共产主义凯歌：最近，首都钢铁公司炼铁厂老工人的两个小女儿，不慎掉进河里，河深水急，眼看着就要卷进急流。路过这里的一个来京串连的女学生，立刻脱下棉大衣跳进冰凉刺骨的河里去抢救。湍急的河水把她冲出一百多米远，另一个来京串连的男学生见了，也奋不顾身地跳下河去救人。后来他们终于在公社社员群众的帮助下，很快把两个小女孩救了上来。首都钢铁公司炼铁厂为此还举行了一个“向共产主义新人学习大会”，许多工人都为自己有这样的好接班人感到自豪，赞扬革命小将这种公而忘私、舍己为人的革命精神。
    在长征中练兵，在长征中接班，这是许多小将的响亮口号。他们知道：只有在群众中、在斗争中、在实践中，才能真正迅速地把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，才能真正让“公”字在自己灵魂深处安家。在观礼台上，一群来自黄海之滨的英姿焕发的女长征队员，在接受毛主席检阅前，兴致勃勃地座谈了她们长征的收获。她们说：今天，我们跨出了长征的第一步，我们就是要在毛泽东思想的指引下，走老红军的路，在长征中接班。猪圈岂生千里马，花盆难养万年松；只有长征才能出千里马，只有险峰才能养万年松。长征的头几天，还没走多远路，她们的脚上都打了泡，走一步，痛一步。她们学习了毛主席关于克服困难的教导，大家说：毛主席说要排除万难，我们这还算不上一难，难道就不能克服了吗？再说红军伤员还爬过了雪山，我们打几个小泡算得了什么？她们从这中间深切体会到，怕苦不怕苦是两种世界观的斗争。只要一想“我”，半步走不动；只要一想“公”，走路打冲锋。她们面对天安门，向毛主席表了决心：一定一辈子当长征人，走长征路，接长征班，把社会主义革命进行到底！
    “南京路上好八连”前任指导员王经文的女儿王能菊，接到爸爸寄来一本《毛主席语录》，扉页上写着：“要想成长，永远跟着党；要想进步，经常学毛主席著作。”她很受感动，把毛主席的书当作命根子。一次，她听到别人说，青年前途凭读书，考大学是大路。她心里也有点动，觉得有道理。但她一对照毛主席的教导，马上发觉这是“私”字在作怪。为什么一事当头，先想私利，只想个人前途，就没想想党和人民的前途呢？她马上摘了王杰日记的一段话记在自己的日记本上敲打自己，要求自己也要像王杰那样回答问题：“什么是理想，革命到底就是理想。什么是前途，革命事业就是前途。什么是幸福，为人民服务就是幸福。”这次她带着这本《毛主席语录》接受毛主席检阅后，决心更好地改造自己。
    长江后浪推前浪，
    世上新人超旧人。
    毛泽东思想哺育的一代新人正在成长，他们是无产阶级革命的未来和希望。有了这样的红后代，我们的社会主义江山一定能够千秋万代保持鲜红的颜色！让我们欢呼一代新人，在无产阶级文化大革命中更快地成长吧！
    向毛主席学习学习再学习
    最响亮的歌是《东方红》，
    最伟大的领袖是毛泽东！
    这是接受检阅的革命小将的声音，这是中国人民的声音，这是全世界革命人民的声音！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在您亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，您一次又一次地接见我们，您一次又一次地为我们指明航向，排除障碍，增添力量。
    您总结了国际共产主义运动的经验教训，把七亿人民引向了社会主义革命的崭新阶段。
    您支持了聂元梓等七位同志的马克思列宁主义的大字报，使无产阶级文化大革命燃成燎原大火。
    您主持制定了无产阶级革命路线，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产。
    您戴上了红袖章，成了红卫兵这一震动全球的革命组织的最高统帅。
    您指示我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    您向我们表示：“我坚决支持你们！”
    您高度评价我们的革命行动：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    您教导我们说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    您抓住了大串连这一新生事物，把文化大革命推向了一个新的高潮。……
    当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家在哪里？就在我们身边，就在我们眼前，就是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席！
    毛主席总是和我们革命群众在一起，充分地信任群众，和群众共命运，同呼吸，全心全意支持革命的群众运动。毛主席的伟大革命实践，给全党同志，给全国人民，给青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样。
    来自湖南湘潭地区的革命师生，想起了难忘的一九二七年。当时，在反动派把农民运动诬之为“痞子运动”、斥之为“糟得很”的时候，是毛主席深入农村，坚决站在革命群众一边，赞扬他们是“革命先锋”，欢呼他们的革命行动“好得很”！
    从王国藩所在的河北遵化建明公社来到毛主席身边的革命师生，回忆起十年前的农业合作化运动。那时，右倾机会主义者对农业合作社进行所谓“坚决收缩”，毛主席予以严厉批判，并且告诫全党同志说：“我们应当爱惜农民和干部的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性，而不应当去挫折它。我们应当同合作社社员、合作社干部和县、区、乡干部共命运，同呼吸，不要挫折他们的积极性。”就在这个时候，毛主席发现了王国藩等二十三户贫农，由三条驴腿起家的“穷棒子社”，高度评价它的革命精神，把它誉为我们整个国家的形象。
    十年过去了，三十九年过去了，毛主席始终代表着革命群众的最大利益，毛主席始终和革命群众在一起，毛主席始终和革命群众心连心。在今天的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席相信群众、依靠群众、尊重群众的首创精神，再一次为我们树立了最光辉的榜样，革命小将们怀着万分崇敬的心情表示，要向自己的伟大领袖学习学习再学习！
    向毛主席学习，学习他的伟大理论，学习他的光辉实践，这是接受检阅的千万革命师生的共同决心。他们说：毛主席的理论在他的伟大著作中，我们要学一辈子，用一辈子，永远照毛主席的指示办事；同时，毛主席还有大量的不上书的“著作”，这就是他的光辉实践，我们更要学习。我们要以毛主席的伟大理论为指南，以毛主席的光辉实践为榜样，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做；毛主席怎么做，我们就怎么跟！
    来自江苏徐州市的一支长征队，正是这样做的。在一千八百多里的征途中，他们不走大路走山路，不住城市宿农村，处处事事以毛主席的光辉榜样鞭策自己，鼓舞自己。他们坚持和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，拜群众为师，向群众学习。有一天，他们走了五十多里路以后，中午来到河北海河工地参加劳动。在劳累的时候，他们重温了毛主席的“到群众里面去，和群众在一起”的教导，想起了毛主席和群众共命运、同呼吸的情景，浑身上下增加了使不完的力量。他们和社员们一起劳动，一起流汗，一起唱毛主席语录歌，一起学习毛主席著作。受到了一次深刻的教育。在接受毛主席检阅的时候，这些革命小将深有感触地说：向毛主席学习，就是要到群众中去，甘当群众的小学生，全心全意地为人民服务一辈子！
    在伟大领袖的支持和鼓舞下，越来越多的革命小将开始徒步串连，走出学校，到社会的课堂，到阶级斗争的大风浪中去锻炼自己。他们正在学习伟大领袖的光辉榜样，沿着伟大领袖指引的道路前进！
    学习伟大领袖毛主席的伟大革命实践！
    学习伟大领袖毛主席的伟大光辉著作！
    大立毛泽东思想的新纪元开始了！
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇向前！
