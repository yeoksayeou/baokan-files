During the Long March, we had extensive contact with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Their strong class sentiments and their practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have greatly educated us.

In the Frontier Commune of Frontier Brigade in Suizhong County, Liaoning, there is a 72-year-old poor peasant named Old Cow. For several years, he has been steadfast in his struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. His stance is firm, and he clearly distinguishes between friends and enemies. Someone told him, "You can't fight them alone." He replied, "Why should I be afraid? Chairman Mao is backing me up!" Although he is illiterate, he can recite many of Chairman Mao's words. He firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and consciously fights against the enemy. When he talked to us, he cited many specific examples to illustrate that landlords and rich peasants are not on our side. He also said, "Some people (referring to those who take the capitalist road) cannot distinguish between landlords and rich peasants. They say that their writing is good, but ours is not. I can't stand that!"

From Old Cow, we learned the spirit of daring to venture, daring to act, and daring to make revolution. We learned a clear class standpoint. At over seventy years old, he is still so active and bold in making revolution. Therefore, he has won the support and love of the poor and lower-middle peasants and has been elected by the commune members as a brigade cadre. Such old poor peasants are our good teachers, and we should learn from them.

I was born into a working-class family and, in the new society, went from elementary school, middle school, to university. I should say that everything is given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao. However, I do not have the deep class sentiments of the old poor peasants. When faced with specific problems, I cannot resolutely, thoroughly, and unconditionally follow Chairman Mao's instructions. In Yuguan, Funing County, Hebei, an old peasant told me, "We poor and hired peasants and the Red Guards are one family." After hearing these words, I was both excited and ashamed. Currently, I am still far from meeting the expectations of the poor and lower-middle peasants and far from meeting the five conditions for cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution proposed by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao said, "The broad revolutionary intellectuals in China, although they have the role of vanguard and bridge, are not all able to go through the revolution to the end. Among them, a part will, at the critical moment of the revolution, leave the revolutionary ranks and take a passive attitude; a few will become enemies of the revolution. The shortcomings of intellectuals can only be overcome in the long-term struggle of the masses." I will forever and forever keep this passage from Chairman Mao in my mind. The direction of the youth movement proposed by Chairman Mao more than twenty years ago has great practical guiding significance for today and the future. We must follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao for our whole life.

    贫下中农是我们的好老师
    长征路上，我们同贫下中农进行了广泛的接触，他们强烈的阶级感情，他们活学活用毛主席著作的事迹，使我受到很大教育。
    在辽宁绥中县前进公社前进大队，有一位七十二岁的老贫农牛大爷。几年来，他一直坚持同党内走资本主义道路的当权派以及地、富、反、坏分子作斗争。他立场坚定，爱憎分明。别人对他说：“你一个人斗不了他们。”他说：“我怕什么，有毛主席替我撑腰！”他不识字，却能背出许多毛主席的话。他牢牢记住毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的教导，自觉地同敌人进行斗争。他和我们谈话的时候，举出许多具体的事例说明地主、富农分子就是跟咱们不一条心。他还说：“有的人（指走资本主义道路的当权派）和地富分不清界限，要他们写标语，说什么他们的字写的好、咱贫下中农写的不好。我就听不惯这一套！”
    从牛大爷身上，我们学习了敢闯、敢干、敢革命的精神，学习了明确的阶级观点。他已经七十多岁了，还是这样积极大胆地干革命，因此受到了贫下中农的拥护和爱戴，被社员们选为生产队干部。这样的老贫农，是我们的好老师，值得我们好好向他们学习。
    我出生在劳动人民的家庭，在新社会从小学、中学一直念到大学，应该说，一切都是党和毛主席给我的，但自己却没有老贫农那样深厚的阶级感情，遇到某些具体问题就不能坚决地、彻底地、不折不扣地照毛主席的指示去做。在河北抚宁县榆关，一位贫农老大爷对我说：“咱贫雇农和红卫兵是一家人。”听了这句话以后，我又激动又惭愧。目前，我距离贫下中农对自己的期望还很远，还远远不够毛主席提出的培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件。
    毛主席说：“中国的广大的革命知识分子虽然有先锋的和桥梁的作用，但不是所有这些知识分子都能革命到底的。其中一部分，到了革命的紧急关头，就会脱离革命队伍，采取消极态度；其中少数人，就会变成革命的敌人。知识分子的这种缺点，只有在长期的群众斗争中才能克服。”毛主席的这一段话，我要永远永远刻在脑子里。毛主席在二十多年以前提出的青年运动的方向，对今天和将来同样具有伟大的现实指导意义。我们就是要沿着毛主席指出的这条道路走一辈子。
