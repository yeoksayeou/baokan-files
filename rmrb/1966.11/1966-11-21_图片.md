They have successfully developed the Huanghe-brand seven-ton three-way self-unloading truck. This truck can unload to the left, right, and rear, taking only nine to twelve seconds to lift and unload cargo. The maximum unloading angle of the cargo bed can reach fifty degrees. It is an advanced vehicle for transporting bulk materials at construction sites and in factory enterprises.
