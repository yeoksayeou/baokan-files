	Thai Independence Movement Calls on People to Unite and Support Armed Forces
	To Wage People's War to Defeat U.S. Imperialism and Its Lackeys

	BEIJING, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on Nov. 1, the Thai Independence Movement issued a statement to the Thai people on Nov. 1 to commemorate the second anniversary of its founding. The statement calls on the Thai people to wage a people's war to resist aggression and the suppression of the people, and to wage a people's war to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique.

	The statement to the Thai people points out that the past year was a year in which the Thai people's struggle for national salvation opened a new chapter, a year in which armed struggle continuously achieved victories. "Because the Thanom-Praphat dictatorship, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, brutally and savagely suppressed the people, patriotic people had no choice but to take up arms to defend themselves. In the Northeast and South, people's armed forces have been formed. From the beginning of 1966 to the present, the people's armed forces have repeatedly fought back against the suppression of the Thanom-Praphat traitorous dictatorship and achieved brilliant victories."

	The statement says that over the past year, people from all walks of life in Thailand have established many national salvation organizations and have joined the Thai Patriotic Front together. This situation shows the rapid growth and unity of Thailand's patriotic forces.

	The statement says that at the same time, U.S. imperialism has further occupied Thailand and intensified its oppression of the Thai people. U.S. imperialism has continuously sent troops to Thailand, built airports, strategic roads, and expanded large ports in Thailand. Thailand's army, navy, and air force have long been under the strict control of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism also uses Thailand as a base to invade neighboring countries. Most of the U.S. planes that bomb Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam take off from Thailand.

	The statement says that to maintain its rule, U.S. imperialism has colluded with the traitorous Thai government to directly suppress the Thai people. It has continuously sent "special forces" from Okinawa to Thailand. These forces, together with the U.S. air assault teams, have already massacred Thai people. U.S. military "advisory" groups and "aid" agencies directly command the suppression of the Thai people. In addition, U.S. imperialism also provides the traitorous government with various military supplies, even supplying poison gas and various lethal chemical weapons to massacre the people on a large scale.

	The statement strongly condemns the Thanom-Praphat clique for brutally violating and depriving the Thai people of their democratic and freedom rights, cruelly suppressing and plundering the Thai people, condemns the Thanom-Praphat clique for selling Thailand to the United States as a base for waging war in the Asian region, and faithfully serving the American masters by sending Thai troops to help the United States invade South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, sacrificing the lives of the Thai people in vain.

	The statement reveals that the Thanom-Praphat government is serving the U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" deception on the Vietnam issue, attempting to help the United States get out of its predicament in Vietnam. Just a few days ago, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, the Thanom-Praphat clique went to Manila to collude with its masters and other lackeys of U.S. imperialism, plotting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. The head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, even personally came to Thailand to inspect the situation of the U.S. occupation of Thailand and ordered his Thai lackeys to execute the U.S. plan to wage war of aggression against Asia. To execute this plan, the Thanom-Praphat government is preparing to launch large-scale "sweeps" from all sides to suppress the patriotic people and armed forces that prevent them from carrying out their evil plans.

	The statement emphasizes: "U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphat government are the most vicious enemies of the Thai nation and people. The Thai people must unite and fight against these two enemies until they are defeated, only then can our nation and people be saved from annihilation."

	The statement calls on the Thai people to unite and organize, fight against U.S. imperialism and its Thai lackeys, give full support and assistance to the Thai people's armed forces, and let the armed forces complete their mission victoriously. At the same time, the Thai people must also be ready to take up arms and join the glorious people's war without hesitation.

	The statement says that over the past two years, the Thai Independence Movement has continuously developed and grown stronger. Since it joined the Thai Patriotic Front as a member organization last year, under the leadership of the Thai Patriotic Front, its forces have entered a new stage of development. At this moment, as it enters its third year, the Thai Independence Movement promises to the Thai people that it will continue to fight more firmly until the six-point program of the Thai Patriotic Front, which is the common goal of all patriotic people, is fully realized. The Thai Independence Movement will continue to fully support and assist the people's armed forces until the final completion of their mission.

    泰国独立运动号召人民同心协力支持人民武装
    用人民战争消灭美帝及其走狗
    新华社二日讯　曼谷消息：据“泰国人民之声”电台一日广播，泰国独立运动为纪念成立两周年在一日发表告全国同胞书，号召泰国人民用人民战争来抵抗侵略和镇压人民的战争，用人民战争来消灭美帝国主义和它的走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团。
    告全国同胞书指出，过去的一年是泰国人民的救国斗争开创了新纪元的一年，是武装斗争不断取得胜利的一年。“由于他侬—巴博独裁政府同美帝国主义勾结，野蛮残暴地镇压人民，爱国人民不得不拿起武器进行自卫斗争。在东北部和南部，人民的武装队伍已经组成。从一九六六年初到现在，人民武装已经多次抗击他侬—巴博卖国独裁政府的镇压，接连取得了辉煌的胜利。”
    告全国同胞书说，一年来，泰国各界人民成立了许多救国组织，并一起加入了泰国爱国阵线。这种形势显示了泰国的爱国力量的迅速壮大和团结一致。
    告全国同胞书说，与此同时，美帝国主义进一步占领了泰国，并且加紧压迫泰国人民。美帝国主义不断增兵到泰国，在泰国修建机场、修筑战略公路和扩建巨型码头。泰国的陆、海、空军也早就被置于美帝国主义的严密控制之下。美帝国主义还利用泰国作为基地侵略邻国，美国轰炸老挝和越南民主共和国的飞机，大部分是从泰国起飞的。
    告全国同胞书说，美帝国主义为了维持它的统治，加紧同泰国卖国政府勾结，直接镇压泰国人民。它从冲绳不断地增派“特种部队”进驻泰国。这些部队同美国空中突击队已经下手屠杀泰国人民。美国的军事“顾问”小组、“美援”分署直接指挥镇压泰国人民。此外，美帝国主义还供给卖国政府各种军事物资，甚至供给毒气和各种烈性化学武器来大规模屠杀人民。
    告全国同胞书强烈地谴责他侬—巴博集团野蛮地侵犯和剥夺泰国人民的民主和自由权利，残酷地镇压和掠夺泰国人民，谴责他侬—巴博集团把泰国出卖给美国作为在亚洲地区发动战争的基地，并且忠实地为美国主子效劳，派遣泰国军队去帮助美国侵略南越、老挝和柬埔寨，拿泰国人民的生命去作无谓的牺牲。
    告全国同胞书揭露，他侬—巴博政府为美国在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局效劳，企图帮助美国摆脱在越南的困境。就在前几天，在美帝国主义的指使下，他侬—巴博集团到马尼拉去同它的主子和美帝国主义的其他走狗勾结，策划扩大侵越战争。美帝国主义头子约翰逊还亲自跑到泰国来，视察美国占领泰国的情况，并且指使他的泰国走狗执行美国发动侵略亚洲的战争计划。为了执行这个计划，他侬—巴博政府准备从各方面大规模地“扫荡”制止它们执行罪恶计划的爱国人民和人民武装。
    告全国同胞书强调：“美帝国主义和他侬—巴博政府是泰国民族和人民的最凶恶敌人，泰国人民只有同心协力地同这两个敌人作斗争，直到把它们打倒，我们的民族和人民才能免于灭亡。”
    告全国同胞书号召泰国人民同心协力组织起来，同美帝国主义和它的泰国走狗进行斗争，给泰国人民武装以全力的支持和帮助，让人民武装能够胜利地完成自己的任务。与此同时，泰国人民还必须随时准备拿起武器毫不迟疑地投入光荣的人民战争中去。
    告全国同胞书说，两年来，泰国独立运动不断地发展壮大。自从去年它加入泰国爱国阵线作为团体会员后，在泰国爱国阵线的领导下，它的队伍便进入了一个新的发展阶段。在跨进第三个年头的这一时刻，泰国独立运动向泰国全体人民保证，它将更加坚定地进行斗争，直到泰国爱国阵线的六项纲领，即全体爱国人民的共同目标完全实现为止。泰国独立运动将继续全力支持和帮助人民武装，直到最后完成自己的任务。
