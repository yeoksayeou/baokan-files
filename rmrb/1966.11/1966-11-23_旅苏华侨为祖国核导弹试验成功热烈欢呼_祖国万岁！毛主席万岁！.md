Overseas Chinese in the Soviet Union joyfully celebrate the success of the motherland's nuclear missile test. Long live the motherland! Long live Chairman Mao!

MOSCOW, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) — Overseas Chinese residing in the Soviet Union have been continuously sending letters to the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union to express their joy and excitement over the successful test of the motherland's nuclear missile. They enthusiastically hail the great achievements of the motherland and shout, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

On October 29, one overseas Chinese wrote in a letter that the successful test of the motherland's nuclear missile is a momentous event that shakes the heavens and the earth. It is a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland. When I heard this good news on the radio, I was extremely excited and couldn't help but shout, "Long live the motherland! Long live Chairman Mao!"

He further wrote in the letter that he had read Chairman Mao's works, including "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," as well as books about Chairman Mao's good soldier Lei Feng and Chairman Mao's good student Jiao Yulu. These readings have greatly educated me and made me deeply feel that Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Only the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can produce extraordinary heroes and create great miracles!

Another overseas Chinese wrote in a letter on the night of October 27 that they were filled with immense excitement to celebrate the great success of the motherland's nuclear missile test. From the bottom of their hearts, they shouted a thousand, ten thousand cheers for Chairman Mao. They will forever follow Chairman Mao from victory to victory, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, and use Chairman Mao's thoughts to boost the morale of the revolutionary people and crush the arrogance of imperialism and all reactionaries.

Another overseas Chinese wrote in a letter on October 31 that they were thrilled and greatly inspired to hear the news from the great capital Beijing that the nuclear missile test was successful. This great achievement fully proves that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create any miracle. It once again demonstrates the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a heavy blow to American imperialism and all reactionaries in various countries, and a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialist aggression.

Some overseas Chinese expressed in their letters on November 3, in poetic language, their boundless love for the motherland and Chairman Mao. They wrote in the letters that the radio waves bring good news, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shines brightly, and Mao Zedong Thought shines even brighter. We, along with our friends, raise our arms and shout, "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live!" This news makes revolutionaries proud and confident, and makes the gamblers lose their arrogance! They lose more and more, and what is even sharper than the nuclear missile is the people armed with Chairman Mao's thoughts.

    旅苏华侨为祖国核导弹试验成功热烈欢呼
    祖国万岁！毛主席万岁！
    新华社莫斯科二十一日电　旅居在苏联的广大华侨听到祖国发射导弹核武器试验成功的喜讯后，陆续不断地写信给我国驻苏联大使馆，热烈欢呼祖国取得的这一巨大的新成就，热烈欢呼“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
    十月二十九日，一位华侨写来的信中说，祖国发射导弹核武器试验成功，是一件惊天动地的大喜事，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是祖国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。当我在收音机旁听到这一喜讯时，我的心情万分激动，情不自禁地高呼：“祖国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    他在信中还说，我读了毛主席著作中的《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》等文章，又读了介绍毛主席的好战士王杰和毛主席的好学生焦裕禄等人的书，使我受到很大的教育，深深地感到毛主席的话句句是真理。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民才能出现上述不平凡的英雄人物和创造出伟大的奇迹！
    另一位华侨在十月二十七日深夜写的一封信中说，我们以万分激动的心情，庆祝祖国发射导弹核武器试验的伟大成功，从我们内心里发出一千个，一万个对毛主席的无限崇拜的欢呼声，我们永远跟着毛主席从胜利走向胜利，我们要永远听毛主席的话，用毛主席的思想大兴我们革命人民的志气，大灭帝国主义及一切反动派的威风。
    还有一位华侨在十月三十一日写来的信中说，我们听到从伟大的祖国首都北京传来发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息，感到万分兴奋和巨大鼓舞。这一伟大的成就，充分证明用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是任何奇迹都可以创造出来的，这又一次显示了毛泽东思想伟大的胜利。这对美帝国主义及各国反动派是一个沉重的打击，对越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略是一个极大的鼓舞。
    一些华侨在十一月三日的来信中，以诗一般的语言，表达了他们对祖国和毛主席的无限热爱。他们在信中说，电波传喜讯，文化大革命放异彩，毛泽东思想更放光明，我们与朋友振臂高呼，伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！这喜讯使革命者扬眉吐气，使赌徒们威风扫地！他们越输越光，比导弹核武器更锐利的，是掌握了毛主席思想的人民群众。
