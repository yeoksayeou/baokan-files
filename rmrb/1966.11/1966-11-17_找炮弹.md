The Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention are the great principles personally formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao based on the sole purpose of the people's army to serve the people wholeheartedly. Serving the people, loving the people, and relying on the people are the core of the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. To execute the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention well, we must firmly establish a worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly. This is what I gradually came to understand and feel through practice.

Last April, our platoon conducted live-fire shooting. After one shell was fired, we did not hear the explosion. After the shooting ended, the entire platoon searched for two days but did not find the shell. At that time, someone said, "It's possible that the explosion sound was too small, and we didn't hear it clearly. Even if we search again, we might not find it. Why bother?" I thought this was a lack of fully establishing a worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly, a concrete manifestation of violating the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. So, I organized the entire platoon to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. Through the study, everyone came to realize that although Chairman Mao did not specify in the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention that an unexploded shell must be found, if this shell is not found, it could potentially cause harm to the people's lives and property. Therefore, everyone continued the search. After searching for another six days, we still did not find it. Everyone analyzed that it might be because of the spring plowing, the soil had just been turned over, and was loose, so the shell might have hit the ground. We then started digging with shovels to find it. This way of digging was very dangerous. If the shovel hit the shell, it could very likely explode. However, no one cared about these dangers. Everyone rushed to the most dangerous places to dig. They said, "We would rather be in great danger ourselves but must not let the masses be in any danger." In this way, on the fifteenth day in the morning, we finally dug out this shell from the ground. After finding the shell, the ground was dug up, so we leveled the ground and planted beans for the production team. The villagers all praised us, saying, "This is truly our people's army. They always put the people first. We must support them well to win the battle."

We realized that these ten days were not just about finding an unexploded shell. More importantly, we understood that to model the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, we must have the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly. With this thought, we can consciously execute the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention in any situation.

    找炮弹
    沈阳部队某部三连班长　范振海
    三大纪律八项注意是我们伟大领袖毛主席根据人民军队全心全意为人民服务的唯一宗旨亲手制定的。为人民，爱人民，靠人民，是三大纪律八项注意的核心。我们要执行好三大纪律八项注意，必须牢固地树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观。这是我在实践中逐渐认识和体会到的。
    去年四月，我们班进行实弹射击，有一发炮弹发射出去后没有听到爆炸声。射击结束，全班到射击场找了两天也没有找到那发炮弹。当时有人说：“很可能是爆炸声音小，我们没听清，再找也不一定能找得到，何必费那个劲？”我认为这是没有完全树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观，违犯了三大纪律八项注意的具体表现，就组织全班学习《为人民服务》和三大纪律八项注意。通过学习，使大家认识到了，毛主席在三大纪律八项注意里，虽然没有规定炮弹没爆炸非得找回来不可，但这炮弹不找回来，就有可能使人民的生命财产遭到损失。于是大家就继续往下找。又找了六天，还是没有找到。大家分析，可能是由于春播，刚翻过地，土质松软，炮弹砸到地里去了，就一锹一锹地挖着找。这样挖着找危险性很大，万一锹碰上炮弹就很可能爆炸。可是谁也不顾这些，都争抢着到最危险的地方去挖。他们说，咱们宁可自己危险万分，也决不能让群众有半点危险。就这样，在第十五天上午，我们终于从地里把这发炮弹挖出来了。炮弹找到了，地翻乱了，我们又把地整好，给生产队种上了豆子。社员们看了都赞不绝口地说：真是咱人民的好军队，他们处处为人民，咱们更要好好支援他们打胜仗。
    我们体会到，这十几天我们不只是找到了一发未爆炸的炮弹，更重要的是，懂得了要模范地执行三大纪律八项注意，必须具有全心全意为人民服务的思想。有了这种思想，才能在任何情况下都自觉地执行三大纪律八项注意。
