This year marks the 30th anniversary of Lu Xun's death. We Red Guards, with boundless admiration, commemorate this great communist warrior.

As Chairman Mao said, "Lu Xun is the representative on the cultural front of the majority of the nation, charging into the enemy's ranks, the most correct, most courageous, most resolute, most loyal, most ardent, and unprecedented national hero."

Lu Xun was the sworn enemy of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. He stood at the forefront of the revolution, charging into battle. With his pen, which was both sharp and humorous, he exposed the faces of the dark forces and the ugly faces of imperialism. He drew them so vividly, exposed them so thoroughly, and criticized them so precisely, fully demonstrating his profound ability to see through society.

Lu Xun was a thorn in the side of all feudal literati, traitorous literati, Kuomintang reactionary literary lackeys, and bourgeois academic "authorities." He was the biggest obstacle to Zhou Yang's promotion of the bourgeois literary line. During his lifetime, Lu Xun sharply criticized and strongly denounced the revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang. The slogan of "literature of the national revolutionary war for the masses" he proposed was based on the party central and Chairman Mao's policy of the United Front against Japan, a revolutionary slogan of the proletariat. The literary line he steadfastly defended was the proletarian literary line. Lu Xun was the great banner-bearer of proletarian culture and a giant of the Chinese cultural revolution.

Lu Xun was a good son of the people and a loyal servant. He linked his fate with that of the laboring masses and the success or failure of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Lu Xun's life was a life of revolution, a life of struggle, a life dedicated to serving the people. His two lines of poetry, "With a stern brow facing a thousand accusing fingers, bowing my head to become an ox for the children," are a concentrated reflection of his proletarian worldview and a vivid portrayal of his character. We revolutionary Red Guards will remember Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from Lu Xun's example, and take these two lines as our motto to inspire ourselves to keep moving forward.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is sweeping across the nation with the force of a thunderstorm, shaking the entire world. The old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from the old society are on the verge of collapse. However, Chairman Mao teaches us, "Whatever is reactionary, if you do not attack it, it will not fall." Therefore, we must learn from Lu Xun's spirit of thorough revolution and sweep away the remaining dregs of the exploiting classes.

We must learn from Lu Xun's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to revolutionize. We must insist on using the forms of big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions to expose and criticize, and resolutely carry out righteous and stern verbal and written attacks on those who represent the bourgeoisie, both openly and covertly. We must be bold in our actions. We must dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to rebel, and dare to revolutionize. We must strike down the "fallen dogs" and pursue the fleeing enemies, not stopping until we achieve complete victory.

We must learn from Lu Xun's tenacious fighting spirit, be good at struggling, and be good at revolutionizing. We must not fear setbacks, not fear difficulties, not fear dark clouds and thunderstorms, not fear strong resistance, not fear repeated struggles, and revolutionize to the end, rebel to the end, and never give up. We must firmly stand under the great banner of Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We must strike down conciliationism, strike down compromise, and strike down servility. We must learn to swim while swimming and temper ourselves in the fiery class struggle to grow into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

We must learn from Lu Xun's clear proletarian stance of love and hate. We must frown at American-led imperialism, Soviet-led modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries. We must frown at those who have infiltrated the party and taken the capitalist road and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities." We must sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and be promoters of the proletarian revolution. We must deeply love our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, deeply love the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, deeply love the towering Chinese people, and love the beautiful socialist homeland. We must study Chairman Mao's three articles, "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "In Service of the People," be good "oxen" for the proletariat and the masses, be good little red soldiers of Chairman Mao, and strive for the sublime and magnificent cause of communism for life.

Lu Xun died for the people's interests; he died heavier than Mount Tai. While commemorating Lu Xun, we solemnly pledge to all revolutionary elders: We will definitely carry on the revolution, carry on the thought of Mao Zedong, and carry the revolution to the end!

Study Lu Xun, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong!

Lu Xun's revolutionary spirit will live forever!

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    学习鲁迅，永远忠于毛主席
    北京地质学院学生　黄平稳
    今年是鲁迅逝世三十周年，我们红卫兵怀着无限敬仰的心情，纪念这位伟大的共产主义战士。
    正如毛主席所说的：“鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。”
    鲁迅是帝国主义和国民党反动派的死对头，他是站在革命最前列的冲锋陷阵的战士。他用他那一支又泼辣、又幽默、又有力的笔，画出了黑暗势力的鬼脸，画出了丑恶的帝国主义的鬼脸，他画得是那样的维妙维肖，揭得是那样的淋漓尽致，批得是那样的一针见血，充分显示了他的深刻的洞察社会的能力。
    鲁迅是一切封建文人，汉奸文人，国民党反动派的御用文人以及资产阶级反动学术“权威”的眼中钉，是周扬们推行资产阶级文艺路线的最大障碍。鲁迅生前曾对周扬所代表的修正主义文艺路线，作了尖锐的批判和有力的抨击。他所提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号，是根据党中央和毛主席的抗日统一战线政策提出的无产阶级的革命的口号。他所坚决捍卫的文艺路线是无产阶级的文艺路线。鲁迅是无产阶级文化的伟大旗手，是中国文化革命的伟人。
    鲁迅是人民的好儿子和忠实的勤务员。他把自己的命运和劳苦大众的命运，和无产阶级革命事业的成败紧紧联系在一起。鲁迅的一生是革命的一生、战斗的一生、全心全意为人民服务的一生。鲁迅的两句诗：“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”，是他无产阶级世界观的集中反映，也是他人格的生动写照。我们革命的红卫兵决心牢记毛主席的教导，学鲁迅的榜样，把这两句诗作为我们的座右铭，激励自己不断前进。
    当前我国无产阶级文化大革命，正以排山倒海之势雷霆万钧之力，席卷全国，震动着整个世界。旧社会遗留下来的剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，已经日薄西山。但是，毛主席教导我们，“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”为此，我们要学习鲁迅的彻底革命精神，把剥削阶级遗留下来的残渣余孽彻底扫荡干净。
    我们要学习鲁迅敢于斗争，敢于革命的精神，坚持运用大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的形式，展开大揭露、大批判，坚决地向那些公开的，隐蔽的资产阶级代表人物继续进行义正辞严的口诛笔伐。我们要破字当头，敢字领先。敢想、敢说、敢做、敢为、敢革命、敢造反，狠打“落水狗”，奋勇追穷寇，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    我们要学习鲁迅的“韧”的战斗精神，善于斗争，善于革命。不怕打击，不怕挫折，不怕黑云迷雾，不怕狂飚雷电，不怕阻力大，不怕反复多，革命到底，造反到底，毫不气馁。我们要坚定地站在毛主席的伟大旗帜下，全面地彻底地批判资产阶级的反动路线，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。打倒调和主义，打倒折衷主义，打倒奴隶主义。我们要在游泳中学会游泳，在火热的阶级斗争中锻炼成长，把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业的坚强可靠的接班人。誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们要学习鲁迅憎爱分明的无产阶级立场，横眉怒对美国为首的帝国主义、苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，横眉怒对混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动的学术“权威”，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，做无产阶级革命的促进派。要无比热爱我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，无比热爱伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，无比热爱顶天立地的中国人民和美好的社会主义江山。要学好毛主席的《愚公移山》《纪念白求恩》《为人民服务》这三篇文章，当好无产阶级和人民大众的“牛”，当好毛主席的红小兵，为崇高而壮丽的共产主义事业奋斗毕生。
    鲁迅是为人民利益而死的，他死得比泰山还重。在缅怀鲁迅的同时，我们向一切革命老前辈庄严宣誓：我们一定接革命的班，接毛泽东思想的班，将革命进行到底！
    学习鲁迅，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想！
    鲁迅的革命精神永垂不朽！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
