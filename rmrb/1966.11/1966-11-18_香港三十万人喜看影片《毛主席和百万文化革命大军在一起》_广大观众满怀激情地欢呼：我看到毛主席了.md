Audiences in Hong Kong and Kowloon, filled with enthusiasm, shouted: I saw Chairman Mao!

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 16th - As the victory news of the proletarian cultural revolution in the motherland continues to arrive in Hong Kong, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon have recently watched the long-awaited color documentary film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army," sharing the happiness of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao.

From the end of October to the beginning of November, this film was shown simultaneously in eight cinemas in Hong Kong and Kowloon. After the news of the film's screening was released, workers, students, and people from all walks of life rushed to call the cinemas to buy tickets, all eager to see Chairman Mao. During the screening, many people traveled from the suburbs to watch, and some watched three or four times.

During the screening, every time Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the cinema would immediately resonate with thunderous applause and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" People pointed at the screen and said happily, "Chairman Mao has come! I saw Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is radiant and healthy, this is our happiness!" After the film ended, the audience still did not want to leave, following the song "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" and clapping enthusiastically. Fishermen in the audience found the song "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" particularly familiar. They said, "We know that with the correct helmsman, there is the correct direction. Our great helmsman is Chairman Mao." A driver said, "Chairman Mao is our great commander. In the past, he wore military uniforms to lead the people of the whole country to fight for our proletarian state, and now he wears military uniforms to lead the cultural revolution, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters."

The scene of Chairman Mao walking to the Jinshui Bridge and coming among the people made the audience feel particularly close. A middle school student said, "This film fully shows Chairman Mao's love for the people and the people's love for Chairman Mao. When I saw Chairman Mao walking among the people and meeting the people, my heart was so happy that it seemed to jump out of my chest, as if Chairman Mao were by my side." A worker said, "Chairman Mao waved to everyone, as if he were waving to me, and I was so moved that I shed tears."

The audience also expressed that the film deepened their understanding of the proletarian cultural revolution and the Red Guards movement in the motherland. An old worker said, "Look at how the Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao and how spirited they are. The reactionary newspapers here that fabricated rumors about the Red Guards have completely failed."

At the enthusiastic request of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, this film is being shown in more than ten cinemas in the suburbs of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    香港三十万人喜看影片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》
    广大观众满怀激情地欢呼：我看到毛主席了
    据新华社香港十六日电  正当祖国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利喜讯一个接一个传到香港的时候，香港和九龙的爱国同胞，最近有将近三十万人观看了他们渴望已久的大型彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》，分享了看到伟大领袖毛主席的幸福。
    十月底到十一月上旬，这部影片曾在港九八家影院同时放映。在影片即将放映的消息传出以后，工人、学生和各界同胞纷纷打电话到影院订票，都急切地要见毛主席。放映期间，不少人从郊区专程赶来观看，有些人一连看了三四遍。
    在影片放映中，银幕上每一次出现毛主席的镜头，影院中立刻响起雷鸣般的掌声和“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。人们指着银幕高兴地说：“毛主席来了！我看到毛主席了！”“毛主席红光满面，非常健康，这是我们的幸福！”影片映完了，观众们还是不愿意离去，随着《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声一个劲地鼓掌。渔民观众对《大海航行靠舵手》这支歌感到特别亲切。他们说，我们知道，有了正确的舵手，才能有正确的航向，我们伟大的舵手就是毛主席。一位汽车司机说：“毛主席是我们伟大的统帅，过去他穿上军装领导全国人民打出了我们无产阶级的江山，今天他又穿上军装领导文化大革命，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。”
    毛主席走到金水桥畔，来到群众中间的镜头，使观众感到无限的亲切。一位中学生说：“这部影片充分表现了毛主席热爱人民，人民热爱毛主席。我看到毛主席走到群众中间和群众见面时，我的心高兴得快要跳出来了，好像毛主席就在我的身边。”一位工人说：“毛主席向大家招手，也好像向我招手一样，我激动得流出了眼泪。”
    观众们还纷纷表示，影片使他们对祖国的无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动有了进一步的认识。一位老工人说：“你看红卫兵多么听毛主席的话，多么意气风发，这里的反动报纸捏造红卫兵的谣言已完全破产。”
    在港九爱国同胞的热烈要求下，这部影片正相继在港九郊区的十多家电影院放映。
