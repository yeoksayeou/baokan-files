Title: Refuting Zhou Yang's "Diverse Themes" Theory
Author: Hu Jingzhi
Date: 1966-11-24
Edition: 6

Zhou Yang resists Chairman Mao's literary line, deliberately distorts the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and under the guise of "diverse themes," promotes bourgeois liberalization. In 1956, he vigorously advocated for "promoting the diversity of themes, allowing writers to freely choose the themes they wish to write about," and said things like "in terms of themes, we advocate for diversity and encourage free creation." In 1960, at the Third National Congress of Literature and Art, Zhou Yang further proposed a complete and systematic "diverse themes" theory, urging writers to "choose themes based on their personal life experiences, interests, and strengths." By 1961, when ghosts and demons were stirring both domestically and internationally, Zhou Yang openly called for writers to refuse to cooperate with the proletarian revolutionary struggle and serve proletarian politics, shouting slogans like "if you are writing a novel but are told to drop it and write something to match the center, you don't have to write it," attacking the idea that "the requirement to write about the center necessarily limits the range of literary themes," and so on. To promote bourgeois liberalization and to usurp and attack Chairman Mao's literary line, Zhou Yang's anti-party activities became more blatant and more frenzied each year.

Under the premise of serving proletarian politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, our revolutionary literary and art workers have the complete freedom to choose themes and have a vast field to roam freely. Why does Zhou Yang constantly shout about not being free and loudly call for "completely breaking" the "rules and regulations" of themes? What does he advocate for, and what does he oppose? What kind of "freedom" does he want to fight for, and where does he want to expand the range of themes?

Zhou Yang advocates for extensively writing about "intermediate characters," which in essence is to write about bourgeois and petty-bourgeois characters, and opposes writing about the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. On one hand, Zhou Yang maliciously slanders that there are no "flawless people" in our lives, opposes the creation of perfect heroic images in our literature, and advocates for writing about the "flaws" in the qualities of workers and peasants and the "wounds" in their souls. On the other hand, he strives to beautify the exploiting classes, saying things like "every class and every group has its advanced aspects" and "the bourgeois industrial and commercial circles also have their advanced aspects," urging our literature to extensively write about the bourgeoisie. Zhou Yang's love and hate are very clear here.

Zhou Yang vigorously promotes and advocates for extensively writing about historical themes, opposing and squeezing out modern themes. In 1958, Zhou Yang proposed the so-called three-pronged approach of traditional plays, newly adapted historical plays, and modern plays, which in reality is to perform traditional plays and newly adapted historical plays, squeezing out and opposing modern plays. On one hand, he advocates for "writing about what you are familiar with, writing about ancient times if you are familiar with ancient times... to do a good job with historical themes," even urging military drama troupes to perform historical plays. On the other hand, he says things like "if a modern play cannot be performed, don't force it," pouring cold water on it. Zhou Yang is truly loyal and devoted to emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, always keeping them in mind. Chairman Mao told us as early as 1944: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that is detached from the people), the people are reduced to dregs, ruled by masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted by you, restoring the true face of history." Zhou Yang has long refused to carry out this directive, and after liberation, he has even more blatantly promoted emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, foreigners, and ghosts, allowing them to firmly control the stage and literary circles. Zhou Yang is determined to promote feudalistic black goods to squeeze out socialist elements.

Zhou Yang advocates for extensively writing about the 1930s to squeeze out the 1950s and 1960s, that is, not allowing literature to reflect the socialist era. On one hand, Zhou Yang vigorously praises the 1930s, making the 1930s sound like a paradise. On the other hand, he maliciously writes about the issue of modern themes. He himself said: "I think modern themes should start from the May Fourth Movement, which is better... Why do I say this? It is to oppose those who limit modern themes too narrowly. I extend modern themes to the May Fourth period, which is a good intention." What a "good intention"! It turns out that Zhou Yang has an unspeakable "grievance" here. This "grievance" is none other than because Comrade Ke Qingshi insisted on Chairman Mao's literary line and in 1961 advocated for extensively writing about the thirteen years since liberation, that is, extensively writing about the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Zhou Yang was very angry about this but dared not openly oppose it, so he proposed writing about the 1930s to squeeze out and oppose writing about the thirteen years.

Zhou Yang distorts the truth of life, passing off the needs of the exploiting classes as the needs of the masses, urging writers to extensively spread bourgeois, feudalistic, and revisionist black goods and poisonous weeds. This is the actual content of Zhou Yang's so-called "diverse themes" theory. Zhou Yang wants to let bourgeois, feudalistic, and revisionist poisonous weeds and black goods, let emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ghosts, scholars, rogues, and hooligans fill the stage and literary circles, serving the restoration of capitalism. This is the true intention behind Zhou Yang's advocacy for so-called "diversity of themes."

Chairman Mao said: "Anything reactionary, if you don't beat it, it won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; where the broom doesn't reach, the dust won't go away on its own." Zhou Yang's reactionary "diverse themes" theory has been circulating in the literary and art circles for so many years, poisoning a large number of revolutionary masses and literary and art workers. Now, it is time for us to take up iron brooms and sweep away this "reactionary thing." Revolutionary people and revolutionary literary and art workers, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, must sweep away all the revisionist dust of the theory of writing "intermediate characters," the theory against "theme determination," the theory of "harmless and beneficial," and so on!

    驳周扬的“题材广泛论”
    胡经之
    周扬抗拒毛主席的文艺路线，蓄意歪曲“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针，借“题材广泛论”之名，行资产阶级自由化之实。一九五六年，他大肆鼓吹“提倡题材的多样性，作家完全有自由去选择他所愿意写的题材”，又说什么“在题材等方面，我们提倡多样化，鼓励自由创造”。一九六○年，周扬在全国第三次文代大会上，更提出了一套完整的、系统的“题材广泛论”，要作家“根据个人的生活经验、兴趣和特长来决定选择什么题材”。到一九六一年，正当国内外牛鬼蛇神都在蠢蠢欲动的时候，周扬竟然公开号召作家可以拒绝配合无产阶级革命斗争，为无产阶级政治服务，叫嚷什么“如果你正在写长篇，却让你丢掉长篇，写配合中心的东西，你就可以不写”，攻击“写中心的要求，势必限制文艺的题材范围”等等。为了推行资产阶级自由化，为了篡改和攻击毛主席的文艺路线，周扬的反党活动一年比一年露骨，一年比一年疯狂。
    在为无产阶级政治服务的前提下，在为工农兵服务的前提下，我们的革命文艺工作者完全有自由选择题材的权利，完全有自由驰骋的广阔天地。为什么周扬却口口声声叫嚷不自由，大声疾呼要“彻底破除”什么题材上的“清规戒律”呢？他提倡的是什么，反对的是什么呢？他要争取什么样的“自由”，把题材“广泛”到哪里去呢？
    周扬提倡大写特写“中间人物”，实质上就是要写资产阶级、小资产阶级人物，反对大写工农兵英雄人物。周扬一方面大肆污蔑我们生活中没有什么“完美无缺的人”，反对我们的文艺创造完美的英雄形象，鼓吹要写工农兵人物“品质上的缺点”，要写劳动人民“心灵上的创伤”；另一方面，又竭力美化剥削阶级，说什么“任何阶级、任何集团，都有先进方面”，“资产阶级工商界中也有先进的一面”等等，要我们的文艺大写资产阶级。周扬的爱和憎，在这里不是很清楚吗？
    周扬竭力抬高和提倡大搞历史题材，反对和排挤现代题材。一九五八年，周扬就提出了所谓传统剧、新编历史剧和现代剧三者并举，实际上是要大演传统剧和新编历史剧，挤掉和反对现代剧。周扬一方面鼓吹“可以写自己熟悉的题材，熟悉古代的写古代……要很好地搞历史题材”，甚至要部队话剧团也演历史剧；另一方面却说什么对现代剧“不能演出的也不要勉强它”，大泼冷水。周扬对于帝王将相，才子佳人，真可算是忠心耿耿，时刻在怀，这才是他的真正的兴趣。毛主席早在一九四四年就告诉我们：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目”。周扬长时期拒不执行这一指示，解放后反而变本加厉地吹捧帝王将相、才子佳人、洋人死人，让他们牢牢统治舞台、文坛。周扬就是要拚命提倡封建主义黑货，好挤掉社会主义的东西。
    周扬提倡大写特写三十年代，以此来排挤五十——六十年代，即不许文艺反映社会主义时代。周扬一方面拚命吹捧三十年代，把三十年代说得天花乱坠；另一方面又别有用心地在关于现代题材问题上大做文章。他自己说：“我看现代题材，还是从‘五四’算起比较好，……我为什么要这样讲呢？就是反对那些人把现代题材限制得太狭窄，我把现代题材延伸到‘五四’时期，也是用心良苦。”好一个“用心良苦”！原来这里周扬有说不出的“苦衷”。这个“苦衷”不是别的，就是因为柯庆施同志坚持毛主席的文艺路线，在一九六一年提倡要大写特写解放以来的十三年，亦即大写特写社会主义革命和社会主义建设。周扬对此非常恼火，但又不敢公开反对，于是就提出要写三十年代，来排挤和反对写十三年。
    周扬歪曲生活的真实，把剥削阶级的需要冒充成群众的需要，要作家去大肆散布资产阶级、封建主义、修正主义的黑货毒草，这就是周扬的所谓“题材广泛论”的实际内容。周扬要让资产阶级、封建主义、修正主义的毒草黑货，让帝王将相、才子佳人、幽灵厉鬼、文人墨客、恶棍流氓等牛鬼蛇神充塞舞台、文坛，为资本主义复辟服务，这就是周扬鼓吹所谓“题材多样化”的真实意图。
    毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”周扬的反动的“题材广泛论”，在文艺界流传了这么多年，毒害了广大的革命群众和文艺工作者。现在，是我们举起铁扫帚，扫清这个“反动的东西”的时候了。革命人民和革命文艺工作者，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，一定要把什么写“中间人物”论，什么反“题材决定”论，什么“无害有益”论等等的修正主义灰尘，统统扫个精光！
