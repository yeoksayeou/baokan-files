	On the morning of October 31st, 600,000 workers, students, armed militia, and other citizens of Conakry, the capital of Guinea, held a rally and demonstration to strongly protest the illegal kidnapping of the Guinean delegation passing through Accra by the reactionary government of Ghana, instigated by U.S. imperialism.

	This delegation, led by Guinea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lansana, was on its way to Addis Ababa to attend the ministerial council meeting of the Organization of African Unity.

	The crowd, filled with indignation, repeatedly shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Yankees, get out of Africa!" "Down with the Accra puppets!"

	After the rally, the angry crowd, holding up signs with anti-American slogans, demonstrated for nearly two hours in front of the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Ambassador's residence, and the Pan American Airways office in Conakry. The demonstrators shouted, "Yankees are scoundrels!" "U.S. imperialists have done nothing but evil!" "Down with old and new colonialism!"

	The demonstrators broke into the courtyard of the U.S. Ambassador's residence, shouting, "Yankees, get out!" "U.S. imperialists, get out of here!"

	An armed militiaman said, "U.S. imperialists are barbarians; they have done nothing but evil in Africa. We militiamen are determined to hold our guns and defend our country and national dignity." Another demonstrator said, "We are determined to smash all the tricks and plots of U.S. imperialism."

	On the same morning, many cities and villages across Guinea also held protest rallies.

	Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, October 31st

	According to a broadcast by Conakry Radio, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guinea issued a statement on October 31st, strongly refuting the lies spread by the reactionary government of Ghana and U.S. imperialism, claiming that some Ghanaians were detained in Guinea.

	The statement said, "We can confirm that no Ghanaians have been detained in the Republic of Guinea. All Ghanaians here can live freely according to their own wishes. When they want to leave, they can leave Guinea."

	The statement pointed out: The statement from Accra is intended to cover up the true purpose of the illegal kidnapping of the Guinean delegation, which is: U.S. imperialism and its servile tools are trying to use this opportunity to obstruct the Guinean delegation from participating in the ministerial-level meeting of the Organization of African Unity, because at that meeting, the Guinean delegation will expose their subversive plots in Africa.

    强烈抗议美帝唆使加纳反动当局绑架几内亚代表团
    科纳克里六万人示威振臂高呼“打倒美帝！”
    几内亚外交部公报痛斥美帝和加纳当局妄图用造谣掩盖罪行
    新华社科纳克里三十一日电　几内亚首都科纳克里的劳动人民、学生、武装民兵和其他市民六万多人十月三十一日上午举行集会和示威游行，强烈抗议美帝国主义唆使加纳反动当局非法绑架路过阿克拉的几内亚代表团。
    这个代表团是由几内亚外交部长朗萨纳率领，前往亚的斯亚贝巴出席非洲统一组织部长理事会会议的。
    参加集会的群众怀着无比愤怒的心情，不断高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国佬从非洲滚出去！”“打倒阿克拉傀儡！”
    集会之后，愤怒的群众高举着写有反美口号的标语牌，在美国大使馆、美国大使住处和泛美航空公司驻科纳克里办事处前面举行了近两个小时的强大的抗议示威游行。游行者振臂高呼：“美国佬是坏蛋！”“美帝国主义者干尽了坏事！”“打倒新老殖民主义！”
    示威群众闯进了美国大使住处的院子厉声高呼：“美国佬滚蛋！”“美帝国主义者从这里滚出去！”
    一位武装民兵说：“美帝国主义者是野蛮的，他们在非洲干尽坏事。我们民兵决心握紧枪，保卫我们的国家和维护我们的民族尊严。”另一位游行者说：“我们决心粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计。”
    同一天上午，几内亚全国许多城市和乡村也举行了抗议集会。
    新华社科纳克里三十一日电　据科纳克里电台广播，几内亚外交部十月三十一日发表公报，严正驳斥加纳反动当局和美帝国主义叫嚷的所谓一些加纳人被拘留在几内亚的造谣声明。
    公报说：“我们可以证实，没有任何加纳人被扣留在几内亚共和国。在这里的所有加纳人都能按照自己的意愿自由地生活。当他们愿意离开的时候，他们可以离开几内亚”。
    公报指出：阿克拉当局的声明，是为了掩盖非法绑架几内亚代表团的真正目的，这就是：美帝国主义及其奴颜婢膝的工具，企图乘此机会阻挠几内亚代表团参加非洲统一组织部长级会议，因为在那个会议上，几内亚代表团将要揭露它们在非洲的颠覆阴谋。（附图片）
