Vice Minister of Education, Seng Luofu, strongly refuted the anti-China statement issued by the Soviet Ministry of Higher and Secondary Vocational Education on November 2 regarding the Soviet government's unreasonable expulsion of all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union. He made these remarks at a rally in the capital to welcome Chinese students returning from the Soviet Union.

Seng Luofu pointed out: "The Soviet government claims that because the Chinese government decided to suspend the studies of Soviet students in China and required them to return home within 10 to 15 days, the Soviet government also decided to suspend the studies of Chinese students and ordered them to leave the Soviet Union. This is completely a fabricated excuse by the Soviet government to force Chinese students to return home."

He said: "Everyone knows that China is currently undergoing a great proletarian cultural revolution, and all higher educational institutions have suspended classes. It is impossible to provide classes for foreign students individually. Therefore, we decided that foreign students in China should suspend their studies for a year or graduate early. The specific graduation time for Soviet students in China still needs to be discussed with the Soviet side. We did not set a deadline for them to return home. The Soviet Union is not undergoing a cultural revolution, and schools have not suspended classes. Foreign students in the Soviet Union are still studying as usual. The Soviet government did not consult with the Chinese side at all and unilaterally decided to expel all Chinese students from the Soviet Union. Isn't this clearly a deliberate attempt to sabotage Sino-Soviet relations and further incite anti-China sentiment?"

He said: "The Soviet government's decision to expel Chinese students is unpopular and has caused dissatisfaction among all upright Soviet people and foreign students in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet government is shouting that the Soviet Union has trained more students for China than China has for the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that assistance is always mutual, and neither side has the right to act as a benefactor. The Soviet Union sent fewer students to China because the Soviet government did not want to, and the responsibility does not lie with China. The Soviet Union accepting more Chinese students is nothing to boast about. The Soviet government attempts to use this to cover up its responsibility for worsening Sino-Soviet relations, but this is absolutely impossible."

Seng Luofu said: "The Soviet government also loudly proclaims that it wants to improve Sino-Soviet relations, which is sheer hypocrisy. Countless facts tell us that you say one thing and do another. You say you want to sign a new agreement with China to exchange students, but you expel all Chinese students from the Soviet Union; you say you want to join forces with China to support Vietnam against the United States, but you collude with the United States, betray Vietnam, and oppose China. Sweet talk and double-dealing have become your usual tricks to deal with revolutionary people. We have already seen through your tricks, so please stop playing these not-so-clever deceptions!"

    我高教部副部长严正驳斥苏联高等和中等专业教育部的反华声明
    苏联政府两面三刀掩盖不了反华罪责
    新华社五日讯　高等教育部副部长段洛夫，今天下午在首都革命群众欢迎我国留苏学生的大会上讲话时，严正地驳斥了苏联高等和中等专业教育部十一月二日就苏联政府无理赶走我全体留苏学生事件发表的反华声明。
    段洛夫指出：“苏联政府说，由于中国政府决定要苏联留华学生休学，并限他们于十至十五天内回国，所以苏联政府也要中国学生休学，并限期离开苏联。这完全是苏联政府捏造的勒令中国留学生回国的一个借口。”
    他说：“大家都知道，中国正在进行一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，所有高等院校全部停课，对外国留学生无法单独上课。因此，我们才决定各国在华留学生都休学一年，或提前毕业。对苏联在华留学生的具体毕业时间，还要同苏联方面商量，我们没有限期要他们回国。苏联并没有搞文化大革命，学校也没有停课，各国留苏学生都在苏联照常学习，苏联政府根本不同中国方面商量，就片面决定赶走中国全部留苏学生。这不明明是蓄意破坏中苏两国关系，进一步煽动反华，又是什么呢？”
    他说：“苏联政府赶走中国留苏学生的决定，很不得人心，引起了一切正直的苏联人和外国留苏学生的不满，于是苏联政府就大叫大嚷，说什么苏联帮助中国培养的学生比中国帮助苏联培养的学生多。谁都知道，帮助从来都是相互的，任何一方都没有理由以恩人自居。苏联派到中国的学生少，是苏联政府不愿意派，责任不在中国；苏联接受中国的学生多些，也没有什么值得吹嘘的地方。苏联政府妄图拿它来掩盖自己恶化中苏两国关系的罪责，这是绝对办不到的。”
    段洛夫说：“苏联政府还吵吵嚷嚷，说什么愿意改善中苏两国关系，这是十足的伪善。无数的事实告诉我们，你们说的是一套，做的是另一套。你们说的是要同中国签订交换留学生的新协定，干的是赶走全部中国留苏学生；你们说的是要同中国联合行动，援越抗美，干的是联合美国，出卖越南，反对中国。口蜜腹剑，两面三刀，已经成为你们对付革命人民的惯伎。我们对你们这一套早已经领教够了，还是请你们收起这一种并不高明的骗人把戏吧！”
