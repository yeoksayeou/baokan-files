Representatives of communist parties and Marxist-Leninist organizations from various countries congratulate the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania

The representatives pointed out: Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the revolutionary people of the world, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a new contribution to Marxism-Leninism. There is no middle ground between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism; to unite with revisionists is to betray the proletarian revolution.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 5th—The discussion on the report of the Party Central Committee's First Secretary Enver Hoxha on the work of the Central Committee concluded on the fourth day of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania.

	After the discussion ended, all representatives unanimously passed a resolution expressing complete agreement with Comrade Hoxha's report, completely agreeing with the political line and practical activities of the Party Central Committee, and requiring all Party organizations to follow the guidelines and tasks proposed in the report in their work.

	By the fourth day, forty representatives had spoken in the three-day discussion.

	On the fourth day of the meeting, Kadri Hazbiu, a candidate member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee and Minister of the Interior, spoke, elaborating on the issue of struggling against domestic and foreign class enemies. He pointed out that to establish a classless communist society, a long and sharp class struggle throughout the historical period is needed.

	Hazbiu pointed out that since the establishment of the people's power in Albania, there has been a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads for twenty-two years. Domestic and foreign enemies have joined forces to constantly plot various schemes, ultimately aiming to overthrow our government and achieve a capitalist restoration. He said that our Party and its founder, Comrade Enver Hoxha, have correctly implemented Marxism-Leninism, enabling us to overcome enemies from all sides and advance our revolution in such a small country surrounded by enemies on all sides.

	Hazbiu highly praised the internationalist aid provided by the People's Republic of China to the Albanian people. He emphasized that the People's Republic of China and the glorious Communist Party of China, led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, have been and are the closest allies and comrades of the Albanian people. He said that we have paid close attention to the congratulatory telegram signed by Comrade Mao Zedong on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to our Congress. This telegram gave a high evaluation of our Party, provided strong support, and encouraged our Party to strive for the victory of socialism and communism and to fight for the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

	Bela Shytura, a member of the Party Central Committee, said in his speech that our Party of Labour believes that the Khrushchev revisionists, through their treacherous acts, have completely excluded themselves from the great anti-imperialist united front and have joined forces with the American imperialists and other reactionary forces. Under these circumstances, any propaganda for "joint action" with the revisionists will bring great harm to our cause and serve the policy of the revisionists and their alignment with imperialism.

	Shytura said that our Party believes that uniting with the people of China, defending the people of China from the aggression of imperialism and its revisionist lackeys, is the historical task of all revolutionary and freedom-loving peoples of the world. Whoever opposes China, regardless of the form taken, will inevitably slide to the side of American imperialism. Our Party and the people of our country are proud to have Marxist-Leninist combat friendship and unity with the great people of China and the glorious Communist Party of China.

	Shytura also warmly praised China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests, pointing out that China's great victory in developing nuclear weapons is a great victory for the forces of peace and socialism and a warning to the American imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	Adil Çarçani, a member of the Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of Tirana, said in his speech that we communists must be highly vigilant in defending the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are building socialism in the midst of imperialism and revisionism. Imperialists and revisionists are exerting all their efforts, using various methods to put pressure on us, viewing our republic as a thorn in their eye, and attempting to strangle Albania. However, they have not succeeded; our glorious Party and brave people have foiled their conspiracies.

	Fato Paçrami, a member of the Party Central Committee and Secretary of the Tirana City Committee, said in his speech: Now our country is carrying out a profound ideological and cultural revolution. To achieve victory in this revolution, there is only one path, which is to engage in a head-on struggle against the enemy, against bourgeois ideology, and against revisionist ideology.

	Paçrami expressed congratulations on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution based on Mao Zedong Thought is an important step in the struggle to carry the socialist revolution to victory in the People's Republic of China.

	The meeting also unanimously passed a resolution on the report of the Central Committee's Inspection Commission.

	From the second to the fourth day, in addition to the delegation of the Communist Party of China, delegations from the Labor Party of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Labor Party of Korea, the Communist Party of Romania, the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Communist Party of Japan, the Communist Party of New Zealand, the Communist Party of Burma, the Communist Party of Malaya, the Communist Party of Belgium, the Communist Party of Brazil, the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), the Communist Party of Ceylon, the Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninists), the Socialist Revolutionary Party of Lebanon, the Revolutionary Communist Party of Sudan, the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador, and the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninists) sent congratulatory messages or telegrams to the Congress.

	Huang Van Hoan, head of the delegation of the Labor Party of Vietnam, read the congratulatory telegram signed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh on behalf of the Central Committee of the Labor Party of Vietnam to the Congress. The telegram warmly wished the Congress a brilliant success and thanked the Party of Labour of Albania, the government, and the people for their resolute support and sincere aid to the socialist construction and anti-American national salvation struggle of Vietnam. The telegram said that the people of Albania, rich in revolutionary traditions, under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour, have overcome various difficulties and achieved great successes in defending and developing their brilliant socialist state. The telegram wished the Party of Labour of Albania and the people great victories in carrying out the great tasks stipulated by this Congress.

	Huang Van Hoan said in his congratulatory speech that we are deeply respectful and excited about the brilliant achievements of the Albanian people and regard these achievements as valuable contributions made by the Party of Labour of Albania and the fraternal Albanian people in the common struggle of the peoples of the world for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism. We are fully confident that your Party's Congress will push the entire great revolutionary cause of the Albanian people to a new stage of development.

	Huang Van Hoan severely condemned the aggressive war and heinous crimes committed by American imperialists in Vietnam. He expressed that the Vietnamese people will resolutely carry the anti-American national salvation struggle to the end.

	Chen Van Thieu, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, read the congratulatory telegram from Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, at the Congress. Nguyen Huu Tho praised the brilliant achievements of the Albanian people in the revolution and construction under the leadership of the Party of Labour. He expressed heartfelt thanks to the Party of Labour of Albania, the government, and the people for their sincere support for the sacred anti-American national salvation struggle of the people of South Vietnam. He wished the Party of Labour of Albania great achievements in leading the people to build a prosperous and powerful country according to the resolutions passed by the Fifth Congress.

	Chen Van Thieu emphasized in his congratulatory speech that even if it takes another five years, ten years, or even longer, the people of South Vietnam are prepared to fight to the end. Even if the American imperialists increase their troops to forty thousand, fifty thousand, or even more, the people of South Vietnam will fight to the end until they achieve final victory.

	Constantin Dragan, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Romania, said in his congratulatory speech that there is a long history of friendly relations and common goals of building socialism between the peoples of Romania and Albania. For the benefit of the two peoples, economic, political, and cultural cooperation is developing.

	He expressed his belief that "the relations between our two parties and between our two countries will continue to be strengthened on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

	Yusuf Ajitorop, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia, warmly praised the brilliant achievements of the Albanian people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour, and highly evaluated the revolutionary measures taken by the Party of Labour of Albania and the government in the political, economic, and military fields. He said that these measures prove how resolutely the Party of Labour of Albania is defending the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, maintaining high revolutionary enthusiasm, and carrying the socialist revolution to the end.

	Ajitorop said that we Indonesian communists regard the communists led by the Party of Labour of Albania as our close comrades. We are proud to have a blood-like connection with the glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

	Ajitorop pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party is paying close attention to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong. This is an unprecedented and internationally significant event in the struggle of the world proletariat, and is another new contribution by Comrade Mao Zedong to the development of Marxism-Leninism theory and practice. He also said that the successful test of China's missile and nuclear weapons has greatly struck at the nuclear monopoly policy of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. At the same time, this is a great encouragement to the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples of the world.

	Ajitorop exposed the alliance and joint actions of the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet leadership and the imperialists led by the United States to engage in anti-communist and anti-people activities, condemned the imperialists and modern revisionists for plotting conspiracies, supporting the fascist military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution, which massacred Indonesian Communist Party members and people, condemned the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in invading Vietnam, and condemned the two-faced policy of the Soviet revisionist group in the Vietnamese issue of pretending to support but actually betraying.

	Ajitorop said that the Indonesian Communist Party, like the communists of Albania and China and all true Marxist-Leninists in the world, regards revisionism as a common enemy. The struggle against imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries cannot be separated from the struggle against modern revisionism. There is no middle ground between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. It is impossible to include modern revisionists in the international anti-imperialist united front.

	In discussing the situation in Indonesia, Ajitorop exposed and condemned the inhuman crimes of the right-wing military regime killing Indonesian Communist Party members and progressive figures. He pointed out that Indonesian revolutionaries are fighting against the military dictatorship organized by right-wing generals.

	In discussing the revolutionary struggle experience of the Indonesian Communist Party, he said that only under the leadership of the working class, through armed revolution, can the people seize power and overthrow the government that maintains imperialism and feudal remnants, the comprador bourgeoisie, bureaucratic capitalism, and landlords. The events in Indonesia have completely declared the bankruptcy of any form of peaceful road theory.

	He pointed out that there was once a "theory" that the government of the Indonesian Republic had two aspects: "anti-people" and "pro-people." This "theory" created an illusion that the birth of a people's government could be achieved through the development of the "pro-people" aspect to gradually eliminate the "anti-people" aspect, and achieve it through peaceful means. In fact, this "theory" deprived the proletariat of its independence in the united front with the national bourgeoisie, merged the interests of the proletariat into the interests of the national bourgeoisie, and placed the proletariat at the tail of the national bourgeoisie.

	He said that the Indonesian Communist Party has drawn lessons from experience: that is, in the international communist movement, the struggle against modern revisionism must be closely linked with the resolute and conscious struggle against all manifestations of modern revisionism.

	Ray Neuns, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of New Zealand, said in his congratulatory speech that the Party of Labour of Albania, under the leadership of the outstanding leader Comrade Hoxha and the Central Committee, has set a great example for the world in adhering to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

	The experience of the Party of Labour of Albania in struggling against modern revisionism and its leader, the Soviet revisionist leadership, is of great significance to all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people, greatly helping and educating our Party to recognize the essence of modern revisionism.

	We are completely convinced that without resolutely struggling against modern revisionism and its leader, the Soviet revisionist leadership, it is impossible to successfully struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism.

	Neuns said that we believe that in the struggle against modern revisionism, there is no neutrality. One path is Marxism-Leninism, and the other is revisionism. There is no middle path.

	The delegation of the Communist Party of Burma said in its congratulatory speech that you and the great Communist Party of China have excellently and brilliantly completed the great task of firmly drawing a line between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism.

	The delegation of the Communist Party of Burma said that the Communist Party of Burma has drawn the conclusion from its own revolutionary experience and international struggle experience that resolutely drawing a line between modern revisionism and us is the main guarantee of revolutionary victory. The Communist Party of Burma openly declared its position that it is impossible to remain neutral between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism.

	The Communist Party of Burma will fight against all reactionary thoughts, firmly support Marxism-Leninism and contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

	We solemnly declare at the Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania that we will, together with the Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, and other Marxist-Leninist parties, carry the struggle against modern revisionism, the main danger in the contemporary international communist movement, to the end.

	The delegation of the Communist Party of Malaya said in its congratulatory speech that the communists of Malaya greatly admire the fearless and victorious revolutionary spirit of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people led by Comrade Hoxha. Because of this spirit, Marxism-Leninism shines brightly in Europe where revisionist ideas are rampant.

	The representative read the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Malaya to the Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, saying that to overthrow imperialism and achieve national liberation, it is necessary to draw a clear line with various forms of reformism and engage in resolute struggle with them politically and ideologically. At the same time, it is necessary to thoroughly smash modern revisionism and never engage in any "joint action" with modern revisionists.

	The letter said that now the people of Malaya, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Malaya, are raising the banner of armed struggle even higher to fight for true independence. We are deeply convinced that the people of our country, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory.

	Jacques Griba, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Belgium, said in his congratulatory speech that the Party of Labour of Albania resolutely implements the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism in revolutionary practice, is a party closely connected with the people and has a revolutionary style, is a party full of proletarian internationalism, and is an indestructible and vigorous party.

	Griba said that our Party supports the brave Party of Labour of Albania and the great and glorious Communist Party of China. We agree with them on all principled ideological issues and strategic and tactical issues.

	Griba said that China is an extremely powerful force in the united front of the world's people against imperialism led by the United States, and is a strong bastion of the world proletarian revolution. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is another heavy blow to imperialism and revisionism.

	Griba said that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are our guiding principles. We strive to implement the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the specific conditions of our country.

	Griba also exposed the conspiracy of the Soviet leadership to engage in "joint action" in his congratulatory speech.

	Benedito de Garvalho, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Brazil, said in his congratulatory speech that the Party of Labour of Albania resolutely and bravely resists modern revisionism and strongly defends the invincible doctrine of the proletariat. History has recorded the great merit of the Albanian people in resisting modern revisionism.

	He pointed out that the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have made the most despicable attacks on the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania. They hate the great and wise leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. However, Comrade Mao Zedong is the beloved and respected leader of all revolutionary peoples and the proletariat of the world.

	He said that the Communist Party of Brazil has always held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. In the great struggle of the world workers' movement, there is no middle ground; either stand with Marxism-Leninism or stand with modern revisionists.

	J. P. Hill, a representative of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), read the congratulatory letter signed by Chairman Hill of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists) at the meeting.

	The letter said that we admire your Party's great struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership.

	The Party of Labour of Albania firmly stands with the great People's Republic of China, the great Communist Party of China, and the great leader of China, Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong is a genius on par with Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The strength of the revolutionary peoples of the world with such leadership is invincible.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and greatly helped our Party's work. Our Party takes the study and application of the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, as the center of its work and practice.

	N. Samugathasan, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Ceylon, said in his congratulatory speech that your principled and firm struggle against Khrushchev revisionism has won the admiration of all true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries.

	He pointed out that in the great struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, declaring neutrality is only the first step towards modern revisionism. Today, the greatest danger within the communist movement is modern revisionism. Do not slip into the position of modern revisionism under the pretext of fighting dogmatism.

	He said that Lenin, in the era of imperialism and socialist revolution, applied, developed, and enriched Marxist theory. Today, in the era when world imperialism is heading towards inevitable collapse and world revolution is heading towards victory, Comrade Mao Zedong has further developed Marxism-Leninism and applied it to the present day. This is the Mao Zedong Thought of today.

	In Lenin's era, whoever attacked Leninism was in fact attacking Marxism. Today, whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is in fact opposing Marxism-Leninism.

	Samugathasan said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in the People's Republic of China has completely buried the hopes of imperialism and modern revisionism to achieve "peaceful evolution" and capitalist restoration in China. This is the reason why imperialism and modern revisionism have launched an anti-China chorus around the world. This is a good thing. The enemy's opposition to you means you are on the right path.

	Jorge Restrepo, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninists), said in his congratulatory speech that he admired the Party of Labour of Albania, the government, and the people for overcoming the political conspiracies planned by the Soviet revisionists in collusion with imperialists against Albania. He pointed out that armed struggle is the path for Colombia. The main battlefield of armed struggle is the countryside. Our Party is inspired by the scientific doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, and learns from the glorious examples of the brotherly parties and peoples of China, Albania, and Vietnam. The brotherly parties of China, Albania, and Vietnam have achieved victory through armed struggle. We, like them, are fighting for the liberation of our people, against American imperialism, the financial oligarchy of Colombia, and modern revisionism.

	Youssef Moubarak, head of the delegation of the Socialist Revolutionary Party of Lebanon, said in his congratulatory speech that Lebanese communists regard international solidarity with the Party of Labour of Albania, the Communist Party of China, and all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces as the cornerstone of the practical activities of each party and the correct criterion for measuring the loyalty of each party to its class.

	He pointed out that it is absolutely impossible to unite with modern revisionists. To unite with Soviet revisionists and other revisionists is to betray Marxism-Leninism, and thus to betray the proletarian revolution.

	Mohammed, head of the delegation of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Sudan, warmly praised the heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win in Albania. He said that now he understands why imperialism and revisionists cannot annex the small socialist Albania, because it is armed with Marxism-Leninism, because the unity of the Party of Labour of Albania and the people is unbreakable, because it holds a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other.

	In his speech, he also congratulated China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons, emphasizing that the achievements of the Chinese people are due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Guillermo Ramos, head of the delegation of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador, said in his speech that only the armed struggle led by the party of the working class can liberate Ecuador from the shackles of American imperialism and the ruling class of the country.

	He said that our goal is to free our people from oppression and disaster. In this struggle, we have obtained the support of our people and the support of the international communist movement, especially the Communist Party of China and other brotherly parties.

	He warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is developing with irresistible momentum. The Red Guards of China are the new force of China. He enthusiastically praised the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards of China under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	F. Dinuzzi, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninists), said in his congratulatory speech that together with the great Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party of Labour of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha has shown the world's communists and Marxist-Leninists the correct path to oppose revisionist betrayal.

	He said that the Cultural Revolution in China and the revolutionary measures proposed in the open letter of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania have universal significance for all Marxist-Leninist parties and the peoples of various countries striving for freedom, carrying out socialist revolution, and socialist construction.

	He pointed out that there is no middle ground between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, but a clear line must be drawn.

	The Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninists) is proud to stand with the Communist Party of China. He pointed out that the Communist Party of China is an invincible bastion for the world's people to struggle for freedom and socialism.

    各国共产党和马列主义组织代表在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大致贺词
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党树立了忠于马列主义的伟大典范
    代表们指出：毛泽东思想是世界革命人民行动指南，中国文化大革命是对马列主义新贡献。马列主义同修正主义之间没有中间道路，同修正主义者团结就是背叛无产阶级革命
    新华社地拉那五日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会四日结束了对于党中央委员会第一书记恩·霍查同志所作的关于中央委员会工作的报告的讨论。
    讨论结束后，全体代表一致通过决议，表示完全赞同霍查同志的报告，完全赞同党中央的政治路线和实际活动，并且要求党的一切组织在自己的工作中遵循报告中所提出的纲领和任务。
    截至四日为止，在三天的讨论中共有四十名代表发了言。
    在四日会议上，劳动党中央政治局候补委员、内务部长卡·哈兹比乌发了言，详细地阐述了同国内外阶级敌人进行斗争的问题。他指出，为了建立一个没有阶级的共产主义社会，需要在整个历史时期内，经过长期、尖锐的阶级斗争才能实现。
    哈兹比乌指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民政权建立二十二年来，一直存在社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。国内外的敌人联合在一起，不断地策划各种勾当，其最终目的就是要推翻我们的政权，实现资本主义复辟。他说，我们党及其创始人恩维尔·霍查同志正确地执行了马克思列宁主义，使得我们战胜了各方面的敌人，使得我们的革命在我们这样一个四面被包围的小国的条件下，也能推向前进。
    哈兹比乌高度赞扬中华人民共和国给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的国际主义援助。他强调指出，中华人民共和国和以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党，过去和现在都是阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密的盟友和同志。他说，我们极其注意地倾听了毛泽东同志签署的中共中央给我们代表大会的贺电。这份贺电对我们党作了高度的评价，给予了十分强有力的支持，鼓舞了我们党去争取社会主义和共产主义的胜利，为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而斗争。
    劳动党中央委员贝·什图拉在发言中说，我们劳动党认为，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者通过自己的背叛行径，把自己完全排除在伟大的反帝统一战线之外，并且同美帝国主义者及其他反动势力同流合污。在这种情况下，任何关于同修正主义者实行“联合行动”的宣扬，都会给我们的事业带来极大的危害，都是为修正主义者及其同帝国主义靠拢的政策效劳的。
    什图拉说，我们党认为，同人民中国团结在一起，捍卫人民中国不受帝国主义及其奴仆修正主义者的侵犯，这是所有革命的和爱好自由的各国人民的历史任务。谁反对中国，不管他采取什么形式，就不会不滑到美帝国主义者那一边去。我们党和我国人民为同伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党有着马克思列宁主义的战斗友谊和团结而感到骄傲。
    什图拉还热烈赞扬中国发射导弹核武器试验成功，并且指出，中国在发展核武器方面的伟大胜利，是和平和社会主义力量的伟大胜利，是对美帝国主义者及其同谋者苏联修正主义领导集团的警告。
    劳动党中央委员、地拉那市人民会议执行委员会主席阿·凯莱齐在发言中说，我们共产党人必须百倍警惕地捍卫无产阶级专政。我们是在狼窝旁边，是在帝国主义和修正主义的包围之下建设社会主义的。帝国主义者和修正主义者竭尽全力，采取各种方法对我们施加压力，把我们共和国看作是眼中钉，妄想扼杀阿尔巴尼亚。但是，他们没有得逞，我们光荣的党，英勇的人民粉碎了他们的阴谋诡计。
    劳动党中央委员、地拉那市委书记法·帕奇拉米在发言中说：现在我国正在进行一场深入的思想文化革命，要使这一场革命取得胜利，只有一条道路，这就是与敌人，与资产阶级思想和修正主义思想进行针锋相对的斗争。
    帕奇拉米表示祝贺中国目前正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，在毛泽东思想的基础上进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是为了在中华人民共和国把社会主义革命胜利地进行到底的斗争中的一个重要步骤。
    四日的会议还一致通过了关于党中央检查委员会的报告的决议。
    从二日到四日先后向大会致贺词、宣读贺电或贺信的，除中国共产党代表团外，还有越南劳动党、越南南方民族解放阵线、朝鲜劳动党、罗马尼亚共产党、印度尼西亚共产党、日本共产党、新西兰共产党、缅甸共产党、马来亚共产党、比利时共产党、巴西共产党、澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）、锡兰共产党、哥伦比亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）、黎巴嫩社会主义革命党、苏丹革命共产党、厄瓜多尔马克思列宁主义共产党和意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）代表团。
    越南劳动党代表团团长黄文欢宣读了由胡志明主席签署的越南劳动党中央委员会致代表大会的贺电。贺电热情祝愿代表大会取得光辉的成功，感谢阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和人民对越南社会主义建设和抗美救国斗争的坚决支持和真诚援助。贺电说，富于革命斗争传统的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的正确领导下，发扬自力更生的精神，克服了各种困难，在胜利地保卫和发展他们光辉国家的社会主义方面取得了伟大的成就。贺电祝阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民在执行这次代表大会所规定的伟大任务方面取得光辉的胜利。
    黄文欢在贺词中说，我们为阿尔巴尼亚人民的辉煌成就感到无比敬佩和兴奋，并把这些成就看作是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民在世界各国人民争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的共同斗争中作出的宝贵贡献。我们完全相信，你们党这次代表大会，将把阿尔巴尼亚人民的整个伟大革命事业推进到一个新的发展阶段。
    黄文欢严厉谴责美帝国主义者正在越南进行的侵略战争和犯下的滔天罪行。他表示，越南人民坚决把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    越南南方民族解放阵线代表团团长陈文修在大会上宣读了越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席阮友寿的贺电。阮友寿在贺电中赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，在革命和建设中取得的辉煌成就。他表示衷心感谢阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和人民对越南南方人民神圣的抗美救国斗争的衷心支持。他祝阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在按照第五次代表大会通过的决议领导人民建设繁荣富强的国家的工作中取得巨大成就。
    陈文修在致贺词时强调指出，即使再打五年、十年，甚至再长一些，越南南方人民也准备坚决打到底，即使美帝国主义者把它们的军队增加到四十万、五十万或者更多一些，越南南方人民也要打到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    罗马尼亚共产党代表团团长康·德拉冈致贺词说，在罗阿两国人民之间有着悠久的友好关系，有着建设社会主义的共同目标。为了两国人民的利益，正在发展经济、政治和文化合作。
    他表示相信，“我们两党之间的和我们两国之间的关系将在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则基础上不断得到加强。”
    印度尼西亚共产党代表团团长优素福·阿吉托罗普在向大会致贺词时，热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中取得的辉煌成就，并且高度评价阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府在政治、经济和军事等方面所采取的革命化措施。他说，这些措施证明，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是多么坚决地在保卫无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，永远坚持高度的革命热情，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    阿吉托罗普说，我们印尼共产党人把阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所领导的共产党人看作是自己亲密的同志。我们两党为与毛泽东同志领导的光荣的中国共产党有着血肉般的联系而感到自豪。
    阿吉托罗普指出，印尼共产党十分注视毛泽东同志所领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。这是世界无产阶级斗争中空前未有的和具有国际意义的一件大事，是毛泽东同志对发展马克思列宁主义的理论和实践的又一个新贡献。他又说，中华人民共和国发射导弹核武器试验成功，大大地打击了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的核垄断政策。同时，这也是对世界被压迫人民争取解放的斗争的莫大鼓舞。
    阿吉托罗普揭露以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者和以美国为首的帝国主义者搞反共、反人民的同盟和联合行动，谴责帝国主义和现代修正主义策划阴谋，支持残杀印尼共产党员和人民的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派将领法西斯军事专政，谴责美帝侵略越南所犯下的滔天罪行，谴责苏联修正主义集团在越南问题上玩弄的假支持真出卖的两面政策。
    阿吉托罗普说，印尼共产党人同阿、中两国共产党人和世界所有真正的马克思列宁主义者一样，把修正主义看作是共同的敌人。反对以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派的斗争不能与反对现代修正主义的斗争割裂开来。在马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间不存在中间道路。不可能把现代修正主义者包括在国际反美统一战线之内。
    阿吉托罗普在谈到印尼的局势时，揭露和谴责了右派军人政权杀害印尼共产党人和进步人士的灭绝人性的罪行。他指出印尼革命者正在进行反对右派将领组织的军人专政的斗争。
    他在谈到印尼共产党革命斗争的经验时说，只有在工人阶级的领导下，通过武装革命，人民才能够夺取政权，推翻维护帝国主义和封建残余的买办资产阶级、官僚资本主义和地主的政权。印尼的事件宣告了任何形式的和平道路理论的完全破产。
    他指出，过去有一种“理论”，即印尼共和国政权有两面性：“反人民的一面”和“亲人民的一面”。这一
  “理论”造成一种幻想，即人民政权的诞生可以通过发展“亲人民的一面”逐步消灭“反人民的一面”，以和平的方式来实现。实际上，这一“理论”就剥夺了无产阶级在和民族资产阶级的联合阵线中的独立性，就把无产阶级的利益融化到民族资产阶级的利益中去，就把无产阶级放在民族资产阶级的尾巴后面。
    他说，印尼共产党从经验中吸取了教训：即在国际共产主义运动中反对现代修正主义的斗争必须同坚决、自觉地反对现代修正主义的一切表现的斗争紧密联系起来。
    新西兰共产党代表团团长雷·纽恩斯致贺词说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在以杰出的领袖霍查同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，给世界树立了一个忠于马克思列宁主义原则的伟大典范。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党反对现代修正主义和它的头子苏共统治集团的斗争经验，对所有马克思列宁主义者和革命人民都具有极其伟大的意义，大大帮助和教育了我们党认清现代修正主义的本质。
    我们党完全相信，不同时进行反对现代修正主义和它的头子苏共修正主义领导的坚决斗争，就不能胜利地进行反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的斗争。
    雷·纽恩斯说，我们认为，在反对现代修正主义的斗争中，不可能中立。一条是马克思列宁主义道路，另一条是修正主义道路，中间道路是没有的。
    缅甸共产党代表致贺词说，你们和伟大的中国共产党一起出色地、杰出地完成了坚决划清马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间的界线的伟大任务。
    缅甸共产党代表说，缅甸共产党从自己的革命经验和国际上的斗争经验中得出这样的结论，即坚决地划清现代修正主义和我们之间的界线，是革命胜利的主要保证。缅甸共产党公开宣布自己的观点，即在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间不能保持中立。
    缅甸共产党将和一切反动思想作斗争，坚决拥护马克思列宁主义和当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。
    我们在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表大会上庄严宣誓，我们和中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其它马克思列宁主义政党一起，要把反对当代国际共产主义运动的主要危险现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    马来亚共产党代表致贺词说，马来亚共产党人非常钦佩以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏的革命精神。由于你们具有这种精神，使马克思列宁主义在修正主义思潮泛滥的欧洲放射出灿烂的光芒。
    这位代表宣读马共中央致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表大会的贺信说，要打倒帝国主义，争取民族解放，必须同形形色色的改良主义划清界线，在政治上和思想上同它们进行坚决的斗争，同时，还必须彻底粉碎现代修正主义，决不能同现代修正主义者搞什么“联合行动”。
    贺信说，现在马来亚人民在马来亚共产党领导下，正更高地举起武装斗争的旗帜，为实现真正独立而斗争。我们深信，有着光荣革命传统的我国人民在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，一定能够战胜各种困难，取得最后的胜利。
    比利时共产党代表团团长雅克·格里巴致贺词说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚决地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理贯彻到革命具体实践中，是同人民群众密切联系和有革命的作风的党，是充满了无产阶级国际主义精神的党，是不可摧毁的、朝气蓬勃的党。
    格里巴说，我们党支持勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和伟大的、光荣的中国共产党，我们同它们在一切原则性的意识形态问题上，在策略和战略问题上的观点是一致的。
    格里巴说，中国是世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的统一战线中的一支无比强大的力量，是世界无产阶级革命的坚强堡垒。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是对帝国主义和修正主义的又一个沉重打击。
    格里巴说，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是我们行动的指南，我们努力在我国具体条件下贯彻马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理。
    格里巴在贺词中还揭露了苏联领导集团搞“联合行动”的阴谋。
    巴西共产党代表团团长贝奈迪托·德加尔瓦洛致贺词说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚决和勇敢地抗击现代修正主义，有力地保卫了无产阶级不可战胜的学说的纯洁性。历史记载了阿尔巴尼亚人民反对现代修正主义的这一伟大功勋。
    他指出，苏共领导人对中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党进行最卑鄙的攻击，他们憎恨中国人民伟大的和英明的领袖毛泽东同志。而毛泽东同志是全世界一切革命人民，无产阶级的不可否认的敬爱的和尊敬的领袖。
    他说，巴西共产党一贯高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜。在世界工人运动进行的伟大的斗争中不可能有中间态度，或者同马克思列宁主义站在一起，或者同现代修正主义者站在一起。
    澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）代表杰·帕·奥德在会上宣读了由澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔同志签署的贺信。
    贺信说，我们对你们党进行的反对帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的伟大斗争无限钦佩。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚定地同伟大的中华人民共和国、伟大的中国共产党、中国的伟大领袖毛泽东同志站在一起。毛泽东同志是同马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林并列的天才。各国革命人民的力量有这样的领导是不可战胜的。
    毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的顶峰，毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，并对我们党的工作给予很大的帮助。我们党把学习和运用马克思列宁主义的普遍原理，即当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想，作为它的工作和实践中心。
    锡兰共产党代表团团长纳·桑穆加塔桑致贺词说，你们同赫鲁晓夫修正主义进行的原则的和坚定的斗争赢得了所有真正马克思列宁主义者和革命者的钦佩。
    他指出，在马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间这场大搏斗中宣布中立，只不过是走向现代修正主义的第一步。今天共产主义运动内部最大的危险是现代修正主义。不要滑到以反对教条主义斗争作幌子的现代修正主义的立场上去。
    他说，列宁在帝国主义和社会主义革命的时代，运用、发展和丰富了马克思主义理论。今天，在世界帝国主义走向必然崩溃和世界革命走向胜利的时代，毛泽东同志进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，并运用于当代。这就是现在的毛泽东思想。
    在列宁时代，谁攻击列宁主义，事实上就是攻击马克思主义。今天，谁反对毛泽东思想，事实上就是反对马克思列宁主义。
    桑穆加塔桑说，中华人民共和国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，把帝国主义和现代修正主义企图在中国实现“和平演变”、资本主义复辟的希望完全埋葬了。这就是帝国主义和现代修正主义掀起世界范围的反华大合唱的原因。这是一件好事。敌人反对你，就是说你走的路是对的。
    哥伦比亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）代表团团长豪尔赫·雷斯特雷波在贺词中，赞扬阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和人民战胜了苏联修正主义者勾结帝国主义者所策划的反对阿尔巴尼亚的政治阴谋。他指出，武装斗争是哥伦比亚的道路。武装斗争的主要战场是农村。我们党为马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的科学学说所鼓舞，并学习中国、阿尔巴尼亚兄弟党和兄弟人民的光辉榜样。中国、阿尔巴尼亚和越南等兄弟党通过武装斗争取得了胜利。我们也像他们一样，为解放我国人民，反对美帝国主义、哥伦比亚金融寡头和现代修正主义而斗争。
    黎巴嫩社会主义革命党代表团团长优·穆巴拉克在贺词中说，黎巴嫩共产党人把同阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、中国共产党和一切马克思列宁主义政党与力量的国际团结，看作是各党的实践活动的基石，是衡量各党对本阶级忠实与否的正确准则。
    他指出，绝不能同现代修正主义者搞团结。同苏联修正主义者和其他修正主义者团结，就是背叛马克思列宁主义，从而也就是背叛无产阶级革命。
    苏丹革命共产党代表团团长穆罕默德在致贺词时热烈赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概。他说，现在我已经懂得，为什么帝国主义和修正主义者无法吞并小小的社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，因为它是用马克思列宁主义武装起来的，因为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民的团结是坚不可摧的，因为它一手拿镐，一手拿枪。
    他在致词中还祝贺中国发射导弹核武器试验成功，并且强调指出，中国人民取得的成就是由于有不可战胜的毛泽东思想。
    厄瓜多尔马克思列宁主义共产党代表团团长吉列尔莫·拉莫斯在致词中说，只有由工人阶级的政党领导的人民武装斗争才能把厄瓜多尔从美帝国主义和本国统治阶级的枷锁下解放出来。
    他说，我们的目的在于使我国人民摆脱压迫和灾难。在这一斗争中我们得到了我国人民的支持，得到了国际共产主义运动，特别是中国共产党和其他兄弟党的支持。
    他热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命正以排山倒海之势开展着。中国的红卫兵是中国的新生力量。他热情赞扬了在毛泽东思想指引下的中国红卫兵的革命行动。
    意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）代表团团长福·迪努齐致贺词说，同以毛泽东同志为首的伟大的中国共产党一起，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党给全世界共产党人和马克思列宁主义者指出了必须反对修正主义背叛的正确道路。
    他说，中国的文化大革命和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央公开信所提出的革命化措施，对所有马克思列宁主义政党和争取自由、进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各国人民是具有普遍意义的典范。
    他指出，在马克思列宁主义同修正主义之间没有中间道路，而应该划清界线。
    意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）为同中国共产党站在一起而感到自豪。他指出，中国共产党是全世界人民争取自由和社会主义的坚不可摧的堡垒。
