Several Long March Red Guard teams have trekked across mountains and rivers from various parts of the country to reach the side of Chairman Mao. Revolutionary youth unanimously praise the benefits of marching in long-distance connections. They have carried out Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on marching in long-distance connections. During their long marches, they enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, extensively interacted with society and the masses, broadened their horizons, and tempered their revolutionary will.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 15th, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao supports long-distance connections, which has greatly inspired revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards nationwide. In recent days, dozens of long-distance connection teams composed of revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards have trekked across mountains and rivers from various parts of the country to Beijing, the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to the side of the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

These long-distance connection teams, named "Long March Red Guard Team," "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team," "Red Long March Team," and "Long March Combat Team," come from provinces and autonomous regions such as Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and Anhui. Most of the team members are college and high school students in their early twenties, with the youngest being only 14 or 15 years old. They have implemented Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on long-distance connections, treating the cities, towns, and villages of the motherland as a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and understanding Chairman Mao's correct line, as a great classroom for understanding class struggle in socialist society and learning from the working class and peasants, and as a great furnace for transforming worldviews and tempering revolutionary will. During their long marches, they extensively interacted with society and the masses, enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, acted as propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and as sowers of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary youth, through their personal experiences of long-distance connections, unanimously praised: Long-distance connections are good!

"The Red Army is not afraid of long marches; ten thousand mountains and rivers are mere trifles." Under the guidance of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary youth, taking the heroic Red Army as their example, fearlessly faced all difficulties and obstacles, braved the wind and snow, and marched forward courageously, creating many moving deeds along the way. Twenty-one students from the Normal School in Shuozhou County, Shanxi Province, formed a Long March Team. When they reached the outskirts of Beijing's Mentougou District, a steep mountain blocked their path. Some students looked at the rugged mountains and the swift waters of the Yongding River below, considering taking the detour via the highway. However, most students disagreed. They said, "We cannot comfortably make a revolution. Bowing to the mountains means bowing to difficulties. If we encounter mountain roads, we should think of detouring, then what is the point of tempering ourselves!" The team leader led everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings repeatedly: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit; it will trample all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy." They then reread the People's Daily editorial "Red Guards Are Not Afraid of Long Marches." After the study, the revolutionary youth unified their thoughts with Chairman Mao's teachings, collectively recited: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They marched forward with high spirits and crossed the high mountain. When they triumphantly reached the summit, they looked out over the motherland's rivers and mountains, feeling their hearts broaden and their spirits lift, and could not help but shout: "Mao Zedong Thought leads the way, overcoming all difficulties underfoot!"

Why can the revolutionary youth be so steadfast and brave in facing difficulties? The youth responded loudly: It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that illuminates our Long March path and inspires us to march forward victoriously. Along the way, many Long March Team members insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Chairman Mao's teachings to unify thoughts and inspire fighting spirit. Along the way, many Long March Teams took the PLA as their example, strictly observing the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention, cherishing every blade of grass and tree in the motherland, and not taking a single needle or thread from the people. The Long March Team from Dongfeng Middle School (formerly the Second Middle School) in Liaocheng, when passing through a village in Hebei Province, waited until it was dark before continuing, choosing to walk an extra five or six miles rather than crossing freshly plowed fields. Some Long March Teams, during their marches, adhered to the "four no-goes"—not leaving until the water jars are full, the courtyard is swept, borrowed items are returned, and accounts are settled.

"The Long March is a manifesto, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a sowing machine." The revolutionary youth, carrying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, propagated Mao Zedong Thought along the way, turning the Long March Teams into propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought and sowing machines for Mao Zedong Thought. They distributed printed quotations from Chairman Mao along the way, helped communes and production teams with blackboard newspapers, wrote slogans; some Long March Teams carried transistor radios, printing and distributing important news they heard as soon as possible; some Long March Teams did not walk on smooth highways but chose rural paths, visiting villages and households to propagate Mao Zedong Thought; some, when camping at night, studied Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village, teaching the farmers to sing songs composed with quotations from Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary youth of the Long March Teams interacted extensively with the masses along the way, deeply feeling the poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love, faith, and reverence for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Many poor and lower-middle peasants, upon hearing that the youth were going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, treated them like their own children, holding their hands, repeatedly advising them to convey their greetings to Chairman Mao.

Through long-distance connections, the youth broadened their horizons, saw the great achievements of socialist construction in the motherland, saw the prosperous scenes of new socialist villages, saw the changes in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of commune members, and deeply felt that all this is the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Twenty-six revolutionary youth from Hongwei Middle School in Ningjin County, Shandong Province, formed the "Long March Red Guard Team" and reached Wen'anwa in Hebei Province. They heard from local cadres and commune members that before liberation, Wen'anwa was a poor place with nine years of harvest in ten, and during years of disaster, the poor fled in all directions. After liberation, the revolutionary masses of Wen'anwa, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, carried out earth-shaking struggles, achieved water conservation, and every household moved into brick houses and used electric lights. The earth-shaking changes in Wen'anwa gave the youth a vivid education in Mao Zedong Thought. Eight Mongolian team members from the 25th Team of the "Hohhot-Beijing Long March Team" interacted extensively with Han poor and lower-middle peasants along the way. Wherever they went, the Han poor and lower-middle peasants not only cared for them in every way but also told them their family histories, giving them class education, making them further understand that the poor and lower-middle peasants and poor herdsmen of all ethnic groups are all on the same vine. The youth said, "Now, we have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's statement that 'national struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle issue' is an unshakable truth. We, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, must forever be loyal to the Party, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, must forever unite closely under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, build our socialist motherland even more beautifully, and ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color!"

    几十支长征串连队跋山涉水从祖国各地来到毛主席身边
    革命小将们都说步行串连就是好
    他们执行林彪同志关于步行串连的指示，在长途行军中，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，广泛地接触了社会，接触了群众，开阔了眼界，锻炼了革命意志。
    据新华社十五日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席支持步行串连，极大地鼓舞了全国革命师生和红卫兵。连日来，数十支由革命师生和红卫兵组成的步行革命串连队，跋山涉水，从祖国各地徒步来到无产阶级文化大革命的中心北京，来到了革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的身边。
    这些以“长征红卫队”、“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”、“红色长征队”、“长征战斗队”等名称命名的步行串连队伍，来自辽宁、内蒙古、河北、山东、河南、山西、安徽等省区。参加步行串连的队员大部分是二十岁上下的大中学生，年纪最小的只有十四五岁。他们实现了林彪同志关于步行串连的指示，把祖国的城镇乡村当成活学活用毛泽东思想和领会毛主席的正确路线的大学校，当成了解社会主义社会阶级斗争和向工农群众学习的大课堂，当成改造世界观、磨炼革命意志的大熔炉。在长途行军中，他们广泛地接触了社会，接触了群众，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，做毛泽东思想的宣传队，做毛泽东思想的播种机。革命小将们通过步行串连的亲身体会，异口同声地称赞：步行串连就是好！
      “红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲。”参加步行串连的革命小将们，在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，处处以当年英勇的红军为榜样，不怕任何艰难险阻，迎着风雪，迎着困难，奋勇向前，一路上创造了许多动人的事迹。山西省朔县师范学校二十一个同学组成的长征队，走到北京市郊门头沟区的时候，一座陡峭的山峦挡住了去路。有的同学望望山上，怪石嶙峋，看看山下，永定河水流湍急，想绕道走公路。但是，大部分同学不同意。他们说，我们不能舒舒服服地干革命，向高山低头就是向困难低头，碰到山路就想绕过去，那还锻炼个啥！长征队的指导员领着大家一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”接着，又重读了《人民日报》社论《红卫兵不怕远征难》。经过学习，革命小将们用毛主席的教导统一了思想，集体朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”意气风发地翻过了这座高山。当他们胜利地登上顶峰时，放眼眺望祖国河山，顿觉胸怀宽广，心情舒畅，情不自禁地欢呼：“毛泽东思想挂了帅，千难万难脚下踩！”
    革命小将们为什么能这样坚定、勇敢地迎着困难前进呢？小将们响亮地回答说，是伟大的毛泽东思想照亮了我们长征的道路，鼓舞着我们胜利前进。一路上，许多长征队的小将们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，用毛主席的教导统一思想，激励斗志。沿途，许多长征队以解放军为榜样，严格执行三大纪律八项注意，珍惜祖国的一草一木，不拿群众的一针一线。聊城东风中学（原第二中学）长征队在路过河北省一个村庄时，天已经黑了，他们宁愿多走五六里路，不愿穿过刚犁好的地。有的长征队在行军途中，做到“四不走”——水缸不满不走，院子不扫不走，借的东西没有还不走，账目不清不走。
    “长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机。”革命小将们带着《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作单行本，沿途宣传毛泽东思想，把长征队办成毛泽东思想的宣传队，当作毛泽东思想的播种机。他们沿途散发印制的毛主席语录，帮助公社和生产队出黑板报，写标语；有的长征队带着半导体收音机，将收听到的重要消息，随时油印出来，广为传播；有的长征队一路上不走平坦的公路，专拣农村小道，挨村串户，宣传毛泽东思想；有的夜间宿营，就和村中贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，教农民唱用毛主席语录谱写的歌曲。
    长征队的革命小将们一路上广泛地接触了群众，深深感到贫下中农社员对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇敬。许多贫下中农社员一听说小将们是到北京去见毛主席的，都把他们当作自己的亲生儿女一样，拉着他们的手，千叮咛、万嘱咐，请小将们一定要代他们向毛主席问好。
    通过步行串连，小将们开阔了眼界，看到了祖国社会主义建设的巨大成就，看到了社会主义新农村的兴旺景象，看到了广大社员群众精神面貌的变化，深深感到这一切都是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。山东省宁津县红卫中学二十六个革命小将组成的“长征红卫队”走到河北省的文安洼时，听当地的干部和社员说，解放前的文安洼是十年九不收的穷地方，遇到灾年，穷人都四出逃荒。解放后，文安洼的革命群众在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，进行了改天换地的斗争，实现了水利化，家家户户住进了瓦房，用上了电灯。文安洼的翻天覆地的大变化，使小将们受到了一次生动的毛泽东思想的教育。内蒙古“呼和浩特—北京长征队”二十五支队的八个蒙古族队员沿途同汉族贫下中农社员进行了广泛的接触。每到一地，汉族贫下中农不但在生活上对他们关怀备至，并且向他们讲家史，对他们进行阶级教育，使他们进一步体会到各族贫下中农和贫苦牧民都是一根藤上的瓜。小将们说，现在，我们更深刻地认识到毛主席所说的“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题”是颠扑不破的真理。我们各族革命人民一定要永远忠于党，永远忠于毛主席，一定要在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，更紧密地团结在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义祖国建设得更美好，保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色！
