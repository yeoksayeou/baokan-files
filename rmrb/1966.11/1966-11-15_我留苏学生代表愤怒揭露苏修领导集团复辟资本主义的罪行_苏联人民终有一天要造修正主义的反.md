New China News Agency, November 14th

The representative of all Chinese students expelled by the Soviet government, Zhang Pengya, at the welcoming rally held by the revolutionary masses in the capital on November 5th, listed the numerous facts they had seen and heard, and angrily exposed the crimes of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership in restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, bringing deep disasters to the Soviet people.

Zhang Pengya emphasized that the treacherous actions of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership have aroused strong dissatisfaction and opposition among the broad masses of the Soviet people. Many facts indicate that the great Soviet people, with their revolutionary traditions, will one day rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist leadership. The glorious light of the proletarian revolution, which was strangled by the Soviet leadership, will once again shine on the source of the great October Socialist Revolution; the banner of Marxism-Leninism, which was abandoned by the Soviet leadership, will once again fly high over the Soviet land.

During Zhang Pengya's speech, the more than 15,000 people attending the rally repeatedly raised their arms and shouted slogans such as "We must carry the struggle against modern revisionism, with the Soviet leadership as the center, to the end!" The following is an excerpt from Zhang Pengya's speech:

In the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we have returned to the side of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, and returned to the embrace of our great motherland. Facing the revolutionary scene and the excellent situation of all-round leaps in socialist construction in our motherland, we recall the various facts of the restoration of capitalism by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership that we witnessed in the Soviet Union, and we feel even more indignant about their heinous crimes. At the same time, we have a deeper understanding of their ugly faces and reactionary nature.

In today's Soviet Union, bourgeois dictatorship has replaced proletarian dictatorship. The high-salaried privileged stratum represented by the Soviet revisionist leadership, that is, the new exploiting class, uses various means to oppress and exploit the broad masses of the Soviet working people, and implements fascist terrorist rule over them. We know a Soviet drilling worker who was simply dismissed by the Soviet authorities for expressing some dissatisfaction with the Soviet revisionist leadership's wrongdoings and was subjected to political persecution. The so-called security organs of the Soviet Union labeled him as a "madman" and sent him to a "mental hospital." The Soviet revisionist leadership is afraid of the masses and afraid of the truth, and ruthlessly suppresses the Soviet people, using various pretexts to lock up a large number of upright Soviet people in "mental hospitals" or "madhouses," subjecting them to cruel mental torture, which is a common occurrence in various parts of the Soviet Union.

To maintain its reactionary rule, the Soviet revisionist leadership has fundamentally destroyed the democratic system of the proletariat. The broad masses of Soviet working people have completely lost the freedom of speech, assembly, and election.

Corruption is rampant, speculation is prevalent
New capitalists and landlords have emerged

The high-salaried privileged stratum represented by the Soviet revisionist leadership uses various privileges to embezzle, steal, speculate, and engage in malpractice, arbitrarily exploiting the broad masses of workers, and squandering the blood and sweat of the people. The high-salaried privileged stratum lives in luxury and decadence, while the living conditions of the broad masses of workers are becoming increasingly impoverished, forming a stark contrast.

Near a capital of a republic where we lived, there is a beautiful mountain with a large group of villas, where today's Soviet big bureaucrats and rich people live in luxury. The Soviet people call this place "Little America." A local party secretary, with only a few family members, occupies two large courtyards, living in a luxurious mansion of over 1,300 square meters, while the living conditions of a large number of workers in this place are extremely poor, and some even have no homes. Another Soviet revisionist leader, in addition to building a luxurious villa in the Moscow suburbs, also built a private villa by the Black Sea. This villa has two swimming pools, one with fresh water and one with seawater, with a special water pump to draw seawater into the pool. An old worker at a university once sadly told us, "I have seen with my own eyes that new capitalists and landlords have emerged in our country."

The winds of corruption, bribery, and speculation have reached an unbelievable extent. Under the encouragement and support of the Soviet revisionist leadership, a large number of urban and rural speculators engage in the black market, from selling fruits, vegetables, and grains to trafficking cars, from operating black markets to running underground factories, doing everything imaginable. Some people openly build villas in the suburbs or scenic areas of cities, renting them out for the enjoyment of the high-salaried privileged stratum and speculators, with nightly rentals reaching tens of rubles, equivalent to a month's income for low-wage workers. The manager of a shoe repair cooperative in a city would extort thousands of rubles from workers every month under various pretexts. If a worker did not bribe him, he would find a way to retaliate and drive the worker out of the cooperative. We know an artist who had to hand over 20% of his monthly earnings to his "superior." In many cities, there are so-called "local bullies" (similar to the heads and fake village chiefs before China's liberation), who exploit the working people ruthlessly, not even sparing the cleaners with the lowest wages, who earn only a few dozen rubles a month. In many cities, even the police stations and courts have become places for open bribery.

Capitalist freedom is rampant
Millionaires' wealth exceeds that of the tsarist era

In today's Soviet countryside, collective economies have been destroyed, capitalist freedom is rampant, and polarization is becoming increasingly severe, with a new rich peasant class rapidly emerging. A so-called "collective farm member" employs workers to privately raise a herd of sheep, totaling as many as 15,000. Another "member" earns 800 rubles a year from the collective income of the farm, while in his private orchard, just grapes alone bring in over 4,000 rubles a year. In addition, his family also privately raises many horses, cattle, and sheep. Such examples are countless.

Due to the active promotion of the capitalist restoration line by the Soviet revisionist leadership, in today's Soviet Union, which they claim has begun building so-called "communism," the three great differences have not only not narrowed but have instead widened. In the Soviet Union, wage differences are enormous, with the lowest wage to the highest wage differing by more than a hundred times. A Ukrainian miner told us, "The wage gap here is getting bigger. Many leaders' wealth has long since surpassed that of the millionaires of the tsarist era." An old doctor at a hospital told us, "I have worked here for decades, but even now, I and my son still have to live in a dormitory. But one of our 'leaders,' even the dogs in his house have their own rooms." In the Soviet Union, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers is increasing. To make a living, many workers have to work in several places, laboring for more than ten hours a day. Many students of worker and peasant origin, driven by life, have to study while working part-time at night or during breaks, some carrying goods at the station, others carrying coal.

Chairman Mao teaches us: To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this. The facts prove that the Soviet revisionist leadership, which has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, is doing exactly this.

Rotten to the core
Openly promoting "If you don't seek gain for yourself, you deserve to be destroyed by heaven and earth"

In October of this year, the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" openly promoted: "Revolutionary heroes like Paul Korchagin are outdated!" Soviet publications also openly promote the bourgeois philosophy of life, "If you don't seek gain for yourself, you deserve to be destroyed by heaven and earth," and widely promote movies that reflect the philosophy of survival and extreme individualism, such as "No one wants to die," "While you are still alive," and so on. At a celebration of the 47th anniversary of the Soviet Komsomol in a city, a Komsomol leader publicly wished the male and female youth present to find a beautiful lover in college and be assigned to a "satisfying" job after graduation.

The Soviet revisionist leadership uses newspapers, magazines, radio, and television to widely promote the rotten bourgeois goods, numbing the people and poisoning the youth. The Soviet authorities openly promote that "jazz music is very pleasant to the ear," that swing dancing has the benefits of "entertainment" and "exercise," and even organize people to teach the youth to swing dance. A university leader openly told the students, "Why do you have to worry about political issues? Go dance! Go to the party! Go flirt!" During the 23rd Congress of the CPSU, some colleges openly held school-wide sex parties, with naked women's images hanging all over the dance hall.

To implement their policy of aligning with the United States and opposing China, the Soviet revisionist leadership vigorously promotes pro-American, anti-American, and pro-American ideas among the people, opening the market for Western culture. In February of this year, during the opening of the Italian Film Week in Moscow, a pornographic film "Juliet and the Ghost" was shown. When the American pornographic film "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" was screened, the Soviet side heavily promoted it. Someone took this opportunity to engage in speculation, with black market ticket prices reaching ten times the original price. The Soviet revisionist leadership opened the door for Western pornographic novels, naked women's images, and the like, and they themselves published things like "Fashion Magazine," "Hairstyle," and the like, to poison the Soviet people, especially the Soviet youth.

The ruble is the boss, poisoning the youth
A "promotion chart" is formulated in schools

To maintain and consolidate their revisionist rule, the Soviet revisionist leadership regards the educational front as the main battlefield for winning over the youth and strives to select and cultivate "successors" for themselves. In all aspects such as enrollment, teaching content, examination system, and graduation assignment, they implement a revisionist educational line that serves their revisionist political line. During enrollment, they squeeze out the children of workers and peasants; in teaching, they detach from reality and labor, engaging in trivial philosophy. Schools implement the ruble as the boss, with the first place in scores, and the amount of scholarship given to students is determined by scores. To poison the youth, the Soviet leadership also formulated a "promotion chart," which is graduate student, associate professor, professor, and so on. The higher the degree, the higher the salary, encouraging teachers and students to pursue personal fame and fortune.

Because the Soviet revisionist leadership widely promotes reactionary bourgeois ideas among the people, especially the youth, the social atmosphere in the Soviet Union is becoming worse and worse. In some bustling streets of cities, prostitutes openly operate in broad daylight. Drunkenness, debauchery, fighting, and murder have become common occurrences. In many places, women do not dare to go out at night, and during the day, they do not dare to go into the forest to pick mushrooms when there are few people. Youth crime is increasing, and in the defendant's seat of the court, one often sees row after row of young people being sentenced to imprisonment. One evening, a young couple passed by the central park of the city and heard a cry for help from the bushes, but they paid no attention and walked away. As a result, a young woman was murdered. Later, someone asked them why they did not go to save her, and they said, "We were in love, what if we went to save her and got beaten to death?"

Such situations are truly shocking!

However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. The great Soviet people nurtured by Lenin will not forever submit to the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership. Chairman Mao often tells us that in the world, including the Soviet Union, the vast majority of the people are revolutionary. In the international communist movement, including the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the vast majority of communists and cadres are revolutionary. The facts are exactly like this. The broad masses of the Soviet people yearn for Lenin and Stalin. They use various means to resist and oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership's restoration of capitalism from the socialism that the Soviet people won with their blood under Lenin's leadership.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by the Soviet revisionist leadership is becoming more and more unpopular. In August of this year, a Soviet reporter said, "The current Soviet leadership has nothing in common with Lenin's party. The new members of the Soviet leadership are all a bunch of Khrushchev's people."

A Soviet truck driver was very angry and said, "Our Soviet leaders have exploited the people to the point of exhaustion!" A middle-aged Soviet woman told a Chinese student, "We all call the high-salaried members of the CPSU 'red' capitalists. These people do not need communism, do not need revolution, are afraid of revolution, and they are also afraid of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China." Another Soviet worker said, "Khrushchev is a rotten tooth. It was knocked out, but it was not pulled out by the root, so it hurts more!"

The broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union have a clearer understanding of the essence of the Soviet revisionist leadership's deception of the Soviet people with the pretext of building "communism." The Soviet people often use political jokes to satirize the deception of the Soviet leadership, and these jokes are widely circulated. There is such a story: An old farmer in a farm heard a report that said, "Communism in the Soviet Union has already appeared on the horizon." This old farmer did not understand what the "horizon" was, so he went home and asked his grandson, "What is the horizon?" His grandson said, "The horizon is a line that can be seen, but the closer you get to it, the farther it is from you." While standing in line to buy pork, a Soviet person asked, "Why is the line to buy pork so serious? When will we no longer have to line up?" Another person said, "When the Soviet Union builds 'communism,' there will be no need to line up, because in 'socialism,' the pork has already been sold out!"

Many signs indicate that the Soviet people's strong dissatisfaction with the Soviet modern revisionist leadership is gradually developing into a struggle against them. This spring, the automobile workers in a city of the Soviet Union went on strike twice. Recently, five Soviet students were arrested by the Soviet authorities, the reason being that they had distributed leaflets and organized resistance against the Soviet revisionist leadership. Not long ago, news of an underground group's activities spread in the Soviet Union. It is said that this group has 25 people, including workers, intellectuals, and engineers, and their action slogan is, "From bureaucratic dictatorship to proletarian dictatorship." They are determined to overthrow the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and restore proletarian dictatorship.

The great Soviet people will definitely revolt. They see the light and the hope of the future from China, which insists on the socialist road, and from the greatest leader of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao. As a Soviet friend said, "Now, hope is placed on the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and on China!" Many Soviet people said with confidence, "Here, there will definitely be a revolution sooner or later." We firmly believe that the great revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, with their revolutionary traditions, will one day rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist leadership. The glorious light of the proletarian revolution, which was strangled by the Soviet leadership, will once again shine on the source of the great October Socialist Revolution; the banner of Marxism-Leninism, which was abandoned by the Soviet leadership, will once again fly high over the Soviet land.

    我留苏学生代表愤怒揭露苏修领导集团复辟资本主义的罪行
    苏联人民终有一天要造修正主义的反
    新华社十四日讯　被苏联政府无理勒令回国的我全体留苏学生的代表张鹏亚，在首都革命群众十一月五日举行的欢迎大会上，列举他们所见所闻的大量事实，愤怒地揭露苏联现代修正主义领导集团在苏联大搞资本主义复辟，给苏联人民带来了深重的灾难。
    张鹏亚强调指出，苏联现代修正主义领导集团的叛徒行径，已经在广大苏联人民中激起了强烈的不满和反对。许多事实表明，具有革命传统的伟大苏联人民，终有一天将起来大造苏修领导集团的反。被苏共领导扼杀了的无产阶级革命的光辉，终将重新普照伟大十月社会主义革命的策源地；被苏共领导抛弃了的马克思列宁主义的旗帜，终将重新高高飘扬在苏联国土上。
    在张鹏亚讲话的过程中，参加大会的一万五千多人，一次又一次振臂高呼“一定要把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底”等口号。张鹏亚的讲话摘要如下：
    在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，我们回到了最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边，回到了伟大祖国的怀抱。面对着祖国一片热气腾腾的革命景象和社会主义建设全面跃进的大好形势，我们回顾在苏联亲眼所见的苏联现代修正主义领导集团复辟资本主义的种种事实，对他们的滔天罪行更加感到无比愤慨，同时也更加深刻地认识到了他们的丑恶嘴脸和反动本质。
    在今天的苏联，资产阶级专政取代了无产阶级专政。以苏修领导集团为代表的特权高薪阶层，也就是新的剥削阶级，他们利用各种手段压迫和剥削苏联广大劳动人民，对他们实行法西斯的恐怖统治。我们认识一位苏联钻探工人，仅仅因为对苏修领导集团的倒行逆施流露过一些不满情绪，就被苏联当局开除，并对他进行政治迫害。苏联所谓的保安机关，给他加上了“疯子”的“罪名”，把他送进了“精神病院”。苏修领导集团害怕群众，害怕真理，疯狂地镇压苏联人民，以各种借口把大批正直的苏联人关进“精神病院”或“疯人医院”，对他们进行残酷的精神折磨，这在苏联各地已经是司空见惯的事情。
    苏修领导集团为了维护其反动统治，已经从根本上破坏了无产阶级的民主制度。广大的苏联劳动人民，完全失去了言论、集会和选举等的自由。
    贪污盛行投机成风
          出现了新的资本家和地主
    以苏修领导集团为代表的高薪特权阶层，利用种种特权，贪污盗窃，投机倒把，营私舞弊，任意剥削广大劳动人民，挥霍人民的血汗。高薪特权阶层穷奢极欲，生活腐化，而广大劳动人民的生活越来越贫困，形成了极其鲜明的对照。
    在我们住过的一个加盟共和国首都的附近，有一座风景优美的山，那里有一大片别墅群，是今天苏联大官僚、大富翁们养尊处优的地方，苏联人民把这个地方称做“小美国”。有一个地方的党委书记，全家只有几口人，就占用了两座很大的院落，住着一千三百多平方米的华丽住宅，而这个地方大批工人住房条件极坏，有的甚至没有房子住。另一个苏修领导人，除在莫斯科郊区建有豪华的住宅外，还在黑海海滨修了一座私人别墅。这个别墅里有两个游泳池，一个是淡水的，一个是海水的，专门装有抽水机把海水抽进游泳池。一个大学一位老校工曾经沉痛地对我们说：“我亲眼看到，在我们的国家又出现了新的资本家和地主。”
    贪污行贿、投机倒把之风，发展到了令人难以置信的地步。在苏修领导集团的纵容和鼓励下，大批城乡投机商人，从倒卖水果、蔬菜、粮食到贩运汽车，从开设黑市到经营地下工厂，无所不为。有的人公然在城市郊区或风景区修建别墅，专门出租，供高薪特权阶层和投机倒把分子享乐，每夜租金高达数十卢布，相当于低工资职工一个月的工资收入。有一个城市修鞋合作社的经理，每月都要假借各种名目，从工人身上搜刮几千卢布。哪个工人不向他行贿，他就寻机报复，把这个工人赶出合作社。我们认识一位画家，他每月的劳动所得，都要上交给他的“领导”百分之二十。不少城市还有所谓“地头蛇”（类似中国解放前的把头、伪保甲长之类），他们对劳动人民的盘剥非常狠毒，连工资最少、每月收入不过几十卢布的清扫工也不放过。在许多城市，连警察局和法院也成了公开行贿的地方。
    资本主义自由泛滥
        百万富翁财产超过沙皇时代
    在今天的苏联农村，集体经济已遭到破坏，资本主义自由泛滥，两极分化越来越严重，新的富农阶级正在迅速发展。有一个所谓的“集体农庄庄员”，他雇工私养着大批羊群，总数竟达到一万五千只之多。另一个“庄员”，他一家每年从农庄集体收入中分得的是八百卢布，而在他私人的果园内，光葡萄一项，每年就收入四千多卢布。此外，他家还私养着许多马、牛和羊，这样的例子是举不胜举的。
    由于苏修领导集团积极推行复辟资本主义的路线，在他们宣称已经开始建设所谓“共产主义”的今日苏联，三大差别不仅没有缩小，反而越来越扩大。在苏联，工资差别极大，从最低工资到最高工资，相差在百倍以上。一位乌克兰矿工对我们说：“我们这里工资差别越来越大。有许多领导人，他们的财富，早已远远超过沙皇时代的百万富翁了。”某医院的一位老医生对我们说：“我在这里工作几十年了，但直到现在，我和我的儿子还不得不住在集体宿舍里。可是，我们的一位‘领导人’，连他家里养的狗都有专门的房间。”在苏联，失业、半失业工人越来越多。为了糊口，许多工人不得不到几处工作，每天劳动十多小时，许多工农出身的学生，为生活所迫，不得不一面上学，一面利用黑夜或课余时间到外面做临时工，有的到车站上去搬运货物，有的去运煤。
    毛主席教导我们：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。事实证明，背叛了马克思列宁主义的苏修领导集团，也正是这样做的。
    灵魂深处腐朽透顶
      公开宣传“人不为己，天诛地灭”
    今年十月，苏联《共青团真理报》公开宣传：“像保尔·柯察金这样的革命英雄早已过时了！”苏联报刊还公开宣传“人不为己，天诛地灭”的资产阶级人生观，大量鼓吹反映活命哲学和极端个人主义的电影，如《谁也不愿意死》，《当你还活着的时候》等等。有一个城市在举行庆祝苏联共青团成立四十七周年大会时，一个共青团领导人公开祝到会的男女青年在大学里找到一个漂亮的爱人，毕业后分配到“满意”的工作。
    苏修领导集团利用报刊、杂志、广播、电视，大量地宣传资产阶级腐朽透顶的货色，麻痹人民，毒害青年。苏联当局公开宣传“爵士音乐非常悦耳”，摇摆舞具有“游艺”和“锻炼身体”的好处，甚至组织专人教青年跳摇摆舞。一个大学的领导人公开对学生说：“你们干嘛要过问政治问题？跳舞去吧！参加晚会去吧！谈情说爱去吧！”苏共二十三大期间，有的高等学校公然举行全校性的色情舞会，在舞会会场上挂满了不堪入目的裸体女人像。
    苏修领导集团为了推行他们联美反华的总政策，在人民中大力宣传崇美、恐美、亲美思想，为西方文化广开市场。今年二月间，意大利电影周在莫斯科开幕那天，放映了黄色影片《朱丽叶和幽灵》。当美国黄色影片《这是疯狂、疯狂、疯狂的世界》上映时，苏方大加宣传。有人利用这个机会，大搞投机倒把，黑市票价比原票价高达十倍之多。苏修领导集团为西方的黄色小说、裸体女人像等大开方便之门，他们自己也发行什么《时装杂志》、《服式发型》等等，用来毒害苏联人民，特别是苏联青年。
    卢布挂帅毒害青年
        学校里制订了一套“升官图”
    为了维持和巩固其修正主义的统治，苏修领导集团把教育战线作为争夺青年的主要阵地，极力为自己挑选和培养“接班人”。他们在学校的招生制度、教学内容、考试制度、毕业分配等各个方面，都执行着一条为其修正主义政治路线服务的修正主义教育路线。招生时，他们排挤工农子弟；教学中，他们脱离实际，脱离劳动，搞烦琐哲学。学校里实行卢布挂帅，分数第一，用分数决定发给学生助学金的高低。为了毒害青年，苏共领导集团还制订了一套“升官图”，这就是研究生、副博士、博士等。学位越高，工资越高，鼓励教师和学生追求个人名利。
    正因为苏修领导集团在人民中特别是青年中大量宣扬反动的资产阶级思想，苏联的社会风气越来越坏。在有些城市繁华的大街上，大白天居然有妓女公开活动。酗酒、淫乱、斗殴、杀人的现象，已经是司空见惯。在许多地方，妇女在天黑后不敢上街，白天人少了也不敢到森林里去采蘑菇。青少年犯罪现象越来越多，在法庭的被告席上，人们常常可以看到一排排的青少年被判处徒刑。有一天晚上，一对青年男女路过市中心公园，听到树丛中传来呼救声，他们充耳不闻，扬长而去。结果，一个年轻妇女就这样被人残杀了。后来，有人问他们为什么不去救，他们说：“我们正在谈恋爱，要是去救，被打死了怎么办？”
    这样的一些情况，是多么地令人触目惊心啊！
    反动统治不得人心
        苏联人民的反抗潜流在发展
    但是，有压迫就有斗争，伟大列宁哺育下的苏联人民是不会永远屈从于苏修领导集团的反动统治的。毛主席经常告诉我们，全世界，包括苏联在内，占人口绝大多数的人民群众是要革命的。在国际共产主义运动中，包括苏联共产党在内，绝大多数的共产党人和干部是要革命的。事实正是这样，广大的苏联人民怀念列宁和斯大林，他们用各种办法，抵制和反对苏修领导集团把苏联人民在列宁领导下用鲜血换来的社会主义复辟到资本主义。
    苏修领导集团所推行的反革命的修正主义路线，已经愈来愈不得人心。今年八月，一位苏联记者说：“现在的苏共领导集团，和列宁的党没有任何共同之处。苏共新领导成员中，都是赫鲁晓夫的一伙。”
    一位苏联汽车司机十分气愤地说：“我们苏联的领导人，把人民都剥削光了！”一位苏联中年妇女对中国同学说：“我们都把拿高工资的苏共领导成员叫做‘红色’资本家。这些人不需要共产主义，不需要革命，害怕革命，他们也害怕中国文化大革命。”还有一个苏联工人说：“赫鲁晓夫是一颗病牙，它被敲掉了，可是没有连根拔除，因此它使人更痛！”
    苏联广大革命人民，对于苏修领导集团用所谓建设“共产主义”的幌子来欺骗苏联人民的本质，也愈加认识清楚了。苏联人民经常用一些政治笑话，来讽刺苏共领导的欺骗，这些笑话流传很广。有这样一个故事：一个农庄的老农民听了个报告，报告中讲：“共产主义在苏联已经出现在地平线上。”这位老农民不懂得什么是“地平线”，回到家里便问孙子：“什么叫地平线？”他的孙子说：“地平线是一种能看得见的线，但是你愈走向它，它却离你愈远。”在排队买猪肉时，有个苏联人问道：“为什么买猪肉排队这么严重？什么时候才能不排队呢？”另一个人说：“到了苏联建成‘共产主义’就不用排队了，因为在‘社会主义’已经把猪肉卖光了！”
    许多迹象表明，苏联人民对苏联现代修正主义领导集团的强烈不满，已经逐渐发展到起来同他们进行斗争。今年春天，苏联有一个城市的汽车工人，曾经两次举行罢工。最近，有一个大学的五个苏联学生被苏联当局逮捕，原因就是他们曾经散发传单，有组织地进行了反抗苏修领导集团的活动。不久前，在苏联流传过一个地下小组活动的消息，据说这个小组共有二十五人，包括工人、知识分子和工程师等，他们的行动口号是：“从官僚专政到无产阶级专政”。他们决心要推翻官僚资产阶级，恢复无产阶级专政。
    伟大的苏联人民是一定要革命的。他们从坚持走社会主义道路的中国，从全世界革命人民最伟大的领袖毛主席身上，见到了光明，看到了未来的希望。正像一位苏联朋友说的：“现在，希望就寄托在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党身上，寄托在中国了！”许多苏联人充满信心地说：“在我们这里，迟早是要革命的。”我们深信，具有革命传统的伟大的苏联革命人民，终有一天将起来大造苏修领导集团的反。被苏共领导扼杀了的无产阶级革命的光辉，终将重新普照伟大十月社会主义革命的策源地；被苏共领导抛弃了的马克思列宁主义的旗帜，终将重新高高飘扬在苏联国土上。
