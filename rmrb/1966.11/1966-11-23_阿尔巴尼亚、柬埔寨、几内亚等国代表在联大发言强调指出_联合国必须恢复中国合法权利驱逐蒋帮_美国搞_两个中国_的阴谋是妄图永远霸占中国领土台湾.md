New York, November 22 (Xinhua) — During the debate on restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations General Assembly, representatives from Albania and several Asian and African countries unanimously demanded the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. They also exposed and condemned the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas."

Before the 18th United Nations General Assembly began debating the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat, Albania, Algeria, Cambodia, Congo (Brazzaville), Cuba, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Romania, and Syria jointly proposed a resolution. The resolution called for the General Assembly to "restore all the rights of the People's Republic of China and recognize its representatives as the only legitimate representatives of China in the United Nations, and immediately expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from their illegally occupied seats in the United Nations and its affiliated organizations."

Cambodian representative Hu Senba spoke first in the debate on the 18th. He began by denouncing the U.S.-orchestrated "two Chinas" plot. He revealed that "the true purpose of this plot is to legalize U.S. interference in China's internal affairs," which "seriously violates the United Nations Charter." He emphasized that "not even a second should be considered for such a proposition." He urged the General Assembly to "reject support for this immoral plot."

Hu Senba clearly stated that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that "the United States must return the Chinese province of Taiwan, which it has been occupying and ruling through the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to China."

Hu Senba demanded that China's legitimate rights in the United Nations be restored "without delay." He emphasized that China is a country that pursues a peaceful foreign policy and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Guinea representative Marouf also spoke on the 18th, demanding the restoration of China's legitimate rights. He pointed out that with the strength of New China, "the past balance of world power has vanished forever."

In exposing the imperialists' slander and defamation of China, he stressed: "When China is wrongly accused of 'aggression,' 'those who are actually committing aggression are sitting among us.'"

On the 21st, Albanian representative Budo spoke. He focused on exposing the U.S. imperialists' "two Chinas" plot. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists have been occupying Chinese territory Taiwan by supporting the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique; their "two Chinas" plot is an attempt to permanently occupy Chinese territory Taiwan. In refuting the proposal by Italy and other countries to form a "committee" to "study" the so-called "Chinese representation issue," he solemnly pointed out that this so-called issue "is a completely clear and simple one that does not need further study," and thus proposing such a "suggestion" is "groundless and unreasonable."

The Albanian representative enthusiastically praised China as the "strongest bastion" of the world's people in their revolutionary struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and as the "greatest defender" of peace, international cooperation, and social progress.

Budo also condemned the U.S. imperialists for consistently using the United Nations to cover up their aggressive purposes and to oppose the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world.

Tanzanian representative Malecela, in his speech, expressed opposition to the proposal by Italy and other countries aimed at creating "two Chinas." He said, "If such a proposal is passed, it would not only be a mockery of the United Nations but also an insult to our intelligence."

He praised China as a peace-loving country. In refuting the U.S. accusations of China's "aggression," he emphasized that it was not China that invaded Vietnam and interfered in the Dominican Republic.

Burma representative U Thant in opposing the fallacy of "two Chinas" said, "Only the Government of the People's Republic of China has the right to represent China in the United Nations." He stressed: "There has never been 'two Chinas,' and there are not 'two Chinas' now." U Thant also expressed opposition to the U.S.-proposed so-called "important question" resolution. According to this resolution, resolving the so-called Chinese representation issue requires a two-thirds majority vote.

Congo (Brazzaville) representative Bakala also clearly expressed opposition to the "two Chinas" plot, saying: "We do not want to be accomplices in creating such an absurd situation." He condemned U.S. provocations against China and pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, propped up by the United States and sitting in Taiwan, "is not the legitimate representative of China."

    阿尔巴尼亚、柬埔寨、几内亚等国代表在联大发言强调指出
    联合国必须恢复中国合法权利驱逐蒋帮
    美国搞“两个中国”的阴谋是妄图永远霸占中国领土台湾
    新华社二十二日讯  纽约消息：在联合国大会辩论恢复中国的合法席位问题时，阿尔巴尼亚和一些亚非国家的代表一致要求恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，驱逐蒋介石集团分子，同时，揭露和谴责了美帝国主义玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋。
    在这届联合国大会十八日开始辩论恢复中国的合法席位问题前，阿尔巴尼亚、阿尔及利亚、柬埔寨、刚果（布）、古巴、几内亚、马里、毛里塔尼亚、巴基斯坦、罗马尼亚和叙利亚等十一国联合提出了一项提案，要求大会“恢复中华人民共和国的一切权利和承认它的政府代表是联合国中唯一的中国代表，并且立即把蒋介石的代表从他们在联合国及与联合国有关的一切组织中非法占据的席位上驱逐出去”。
    柬埔寨代表胡森巴在十八日的辩论中首先发言。他一开始就谴责了美国策划的“两个中国”的阴谋。他揭露说，“这个阴谋的真正目的是使美国干涉中国人民的内政合法化”，因而“是严重地违反联合国宪章的”。他强调说，对这种“主张”“连一秒钟也不能考虑”。他要求大会“拒绝支持这种不道德的阴谋”。
    胡森巴明确指出，台湾是中国的领土，“美国必须把它假手蒋介石集团占领和统治的中国台湾省归还给中国”。
    胡森巴要求“毫不迟延”地恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，他强调指出，中国是一个奉行和平的外交政策、不干涉他国内政的国家。
    几内亚代表马鲁夫也在十八日的会上发言，要求恢复中国的合法权利。他指出，由于新中国的强大，“以往的那种世界力量的对比已经一去不复返了”。
    他在揭露帝国主义对中国的造谣诬蔑时还强调指出：在中国被错误地指责为“进行侵略”时，“那些进行侵略的人却稳坐在我们中间”。
    二十一日，阿尔巴尼亚代表布多发言。他着重揭露了美帝国主义策划的“两个中国”的阴谋。他指出，美帝国主义一直通过扶植蒋介石卖国集团霸占着中国领土台湾；它搞“两个中国”的阴谋，就是企图达到它永远霸占中国领土台湾的目的。他在驳斥由意大利等国出面提出的关于成立一个“委员会”来“研究”所谓“中国代表权问题”的提案时严正指出，这个所谓的问题“是一个完全清楚和简单的、用不着再研究的问题”，因此提出这种“建议”是“既没有根据，也没有道理的”。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表热烈赞扬中国是世界人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的革命斗争的“最强大的堡垒”，是“和平、国际合作和社会进步的最伟大的捍卫者”。
    布多还谴责美帝国主义一贯利用联合国来掩盖它的侵略目的，反对中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民。
    坦桑尼亚代表马莱塞拉在发言中表示反对由意大利等国出面提出的目的在于制造“两个中国”的“建议”。他说，“如果通过这样一个建议，那不仅是对联合国的讽刺，也是对我们智慧的侮辱”。
    他赞扬中国是一个爱好和平的国家。他在驳斥美国诬蔑中国“侵略”时强调指出，侵略越南、干涉多米尼加的并不是中国。
    缅甸代表吴梭丁在表示反对所谓“两个中国”的谬论时说，只有中华人民共和国政府有权在联合国代表中国。他强调指出：从来没有过“两个中国”，现在也不存在“两个中国”。吴梭丁还表示反对美国提出的所谓“重要问题”的提案。根据这个提案，解决所谓的中国代表权问题需要三分之二的多数票。
    刚果（布）代表巴卡拉，也明确表示反对“两个中国”的阴谋，他说：“我们不愿成为造成（“两个中国”这样一种）荒谬局面的同谋。”他谴责美国对中国的挑衅，并且指出，在美国扶植下盘踞台湾的蒋介石卖国集团“不是中国的合法代表”。
