The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition in Nagoya Opens Successfully
Xiao Xiangqian, the Head of the Delegation, Thanks the Japanese People for Their Support and Announces the Severance of All Ties with the Old Japan-China Friendship Association

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 20th: Nagoya, Japan - Following the successful exhibition in Kitakyushu, the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition opened triumphantly on the afternoon of the 19th in Nagoya, with the enthusiastic support and assistance of Japanese friends.

	Invited to attend the opening ceremony were more than 2,500 people from various circles in Nagoya City and the central regions of Aichi, Gifu, and Mie, as well as prominent figures from various parts of Japan who had come to participate.

	The venue for the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition is located within the Suzu Park Square in Nagoya City. Red flags fluttered on both sides of the park's entrance. Above the main building of the exhibition hall, a giant red star shone brightly. Below it, a quote from Chairman Mao was displayed: "We are engaged in a great cause that has never been undertaken by our predecessors." At the entrance to the exhibition hall, a large portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, was prominently displayed against a backdrop of green pines. Opposite the portrait, a giant banner read: "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" On the tall banner tower, it was also written: "The friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will last for generations!" The atmosphere of Sino-Japanese friendship permeated the exhibition hall and its surroundings.

	Xiao Xiangqian, the head of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition delegation, spoke at the opening ceremony: The opening of the Chinese exhibition in Nagoya is the result of the struggle between the peoples of China and Japan against all reactionary forces that seek to disrupt Sino-Japanese friendship. It is a victory for the strong desire of the peoples of both countries to expand trade and develop friendly relations. The Chinese exhibition introduces the dynamic scene of our people transforming matter into spirit and spirit into matter under the leadership of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao. It reflects the glorious achievements made by the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and innovate.

	Xiao Xiangqian pointed out that the successful experience of the Chinese exhibition in Kitakyushu proves that to make the exhibition a success and to unite more friends to cooperate with us, we must strictly distinguish between true friendship and false friendship. We must be vigilant against the disruptive activities of those who pretend to cooperate but actually cause trouble, who pretend to support but actually sabotage, and who have ulterior motives.

	Xiao Xiangqian, the head of the delegation, expressed his heartfelt congratulations and firm support for the establishment of the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox). He also announced the severance of all ties with the old Japan-China Friendship Association, which is controlled by a small group of anti-China elements.

	Tanaka Kunitoshi, the chairman of the Central Japan Cooperation Committee for the Chinese Exhibition, noted in his speech that the holding of this exhibition has been repeatedly disrupted by a small group of forces opposed to Sino-Japanese friendship and trade. However, with the support and assistance of the people of central Japan and various parts of Japan, as well as the close cooperation of relevant personnel from both Japan and China, the exhibition has finally overcome these difficulties, obstacles, and disruptions to open successfully.

	Speakers at the ceremony also included Vice Chairman Kuroda Toshio of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, Chairman Nakajima Kenzo of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Chairman Kawase Ichikan of the Japan National Cooperation Committee for the Chinese Exhibition, Chairman Miyake Hachiro of the Japan International Trade Local Parliamentarians' League, Mayor Yoshida Hosei of Kitakyushu City, Mayor Sugio Toshiyuki of Nagoya City, Chairman Ariyama Kenko of the Aichi Prefecture (orthodox) United Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Morii Shoi, a representative of the friendly trade circles. They all unanimously wished the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition another success.

	Despite the various reactionary forces that disrupt the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan, trying every trick to obstruct the exhibition in Nagoya, true friends of Sino-Japanese friendship from various parts of Japan rushed to Nagoya to attend the opening ceremony. They included: Vice Chairman Kuroda Toshio, Ohmori Shinichiro, Vice Chairman Iwakura Mitsuo of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, Chairman Nakajima Kenzo of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Director Otsuka Yuzhou of the Osaka Japan-China Friendship Academy, Secretary-General Itaya Shoichiro of the Asia-Africa Peoples' Solidarity Council of Japan, Chairman Koya Shoichiro of the Yamaguchi Prefecture (orthodox) Japan-China Friendship Association, Editor-in-Chief Fukuda Seigyo of the Choshu Shimbun, Vice Chairman Harada Nagatsugu of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, Kawase Ichikan, Chairman of the Japan National Cooperation Committee for the Chinese Exhibition, Diet members Shizuki Shichiro, Sato Kanjiro, Yokoyama Toshiaki, and Konishi Shinichi of the Socialist Party. They especially came from Tokyo, Osaka, Yamaguchi, and other places to attend the opening ceremony. Guests from Kyoto, Kobe, Kitakyushu, and the Tohoku region, as well as friends from the trade circles, also attended the opening ceremony.

	That evening, Xiao Xiangqian, the head of the delegation, held a reception to celebrate the successful opening of the Chinese exhibition. More than 2,000 friends from various places attended the reception.

	On the eve of the opening of the Chinese exhibition, Tanaka Kunitoshi, the chairman of the Central Japan Cooperation Committee, also held a reception to welcome Xiao Xiangqian, the head of the delegation, and all the members of the exhibition delegation.
