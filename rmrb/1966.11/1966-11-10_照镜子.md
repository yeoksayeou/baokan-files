Artillery Company Commander Li Jinkang has a unique "mirror" hanging on his bedhead, which he calls a "bedhead mirror." The left side of the "mirror" is labeled "My Flaws," and the right side is labeled "Chairman Mao's Instructions." Li, the company commander, uses this "mirror" to repeatedly cleanse the dust from his thoughts every day.

How did the "bedhead mirror" come about?

One Sunday morning this summer, after the soldiers had gotten up and engaged in a fierce "battle," the glass and floor in the dormitory were polished to a gleaming shine; everything was neatly arranged. The golden sunlight streamed into the dormitory, making one feel particularly comfortable.

Li, the company commander, walked from one end of the dormitory to the other, a satisfied smile spreading across his face. However, when he entered the driver's dormitory, his expression immediately darkened. The comrades in the driver's squad were still sound asleep. Li, the company commander, had a fiery temper, and upon seeing this, he became angry. He shouted to the drivers, "Get up!"

The soldiers immediately sat up.

The company commander said sharply, "The entire company, only your driver's squad has such a sloppy attitude. Even though it's Sunday, you can't sleep until the sun is on your butt!"

The driver's squad leader said to the company commander, "This isn't the soldiers' fault. Our squad—"

"The squad should thoroughly examine the reasons in your thoughts," the company commander interrupted the driver's squad leader, criticizing him.

The company commander's words made the soldiers all hang their heads.

In the evening roll call, the company commander, to make the other squads take heed, criticized the driver's squad again. Unexpectedly, the company commander's criticism sparked a storm.

The next afternoon, after returning from drill, the company commander had not yet entered the company office when he heard the clerk, Nie Ruilin, shouting in a loud voice, "The driver's squad doesn't humbly accept criticism and instead fires back, truly playing the fool!"

The company commander entered the company office and asked the clerk, "What happened?" The clerk handed the company commander a note and said, "Here, you see for yourself."

The company commander took the note and saw the following written on it:

    The company commander acts too subjectively,
    The drivers' late rising has a reason.
    Without investigation, no right to speak,
    Speak only after investigation.

    Driver's Squad Soldiers

Next to this opinion, there was a Chairman Mao quote written in red ink:

    "There are many people who, as soon as they get off the car, start blabbering, criticizing this and that, but such people will all fail."

The company commander usually handled issues subjectively, but he was particularly afraid of others criticizing him for being subjective. Today, the driver's squad's opinion deeply struck a nerve. The company commander's head was spinning. He thought: I am familiar with every soldier in the company like I am familiar with the fingerprints on my own hand, how could I say I have no "right to speak"? Besides, yesterday the driver's squad was late getting up, I saw it with my own eyes, do I still need to investigate? The company commander became annoyed. Suddenly, Chairman Mao's words echoed in his ears: "Because we are serving the people, so if we have flaws, we should not be afraid of others pointing them out." Chairman Mao's instructions made the company commander calm down. Was yesterday's matter really handled properly? He examined himself against the driver's squad's note. The more he examined, the more he felt he had handled the matter improperly: he only knew that the driver's squad was late getting up, but why were they late getting up? He indeed lacked investigation and research.

That night, the company commander took the note to the driver's squad and humbly listened to the soldiers' criticisms. It turned out that the night before, a horse in the company had fallen seriously ill, and the comrades in the driver's squad had called the veterinarian, given the horse medicine, and had been busy all night. They only went to sleep at dawn, hence they overslept the next day. That night's roll call, the company commander praised the driver's squad's selfless spirit of "saving the military horse at night," sincerely examined his own subjective mistakes. He said: "In the past, I always thought that since I live in the company, I don't need to investigate and research? The driver's squad's shot is good, hitting the target; the driver's squad's note is also good, it is the medicine to cure my illness. In the future, if you see any of my actions that do not conform to Chairman Mao's instructions, just fire away..."

The entire company erupted in applause, drowning out the company commander's voice.

After the meeting, the lights-out signal had long since sounded, but the company commander was wide awake. He sat under the lamp, holding the driver's squad's note and the note they sent, examining and pondering over and over. Suddenly, he felt a burst of clarity, a burst of joy spreading across his face. He found a piece of hard paper, cut it into a mirror-sized square, and carefully copied the driver's squad's note and Chairman Mao's quote onto it. Whether it was because he was too serious or because the weather was too hot, the company commander wrote a hundred or so characters and broke out in a sweat.

After finishing, the company commander hung the mirror-sized hard paper on his bedhead. The clerk, who was standing by, looked at it for a long time but still didn't understand the company commander's intention. He couldn't help but ask, "What is the company commander doing with this piece of hard paper?" The company commander said, "Use Chairman Mao's instructions as a mirror, check your thoughts every day, and always act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." The company commander's words were like steel balls falling onto a silver plate, ringing clearly.

The next day, the clerk wrote an article about the company commander making the "bedhead mirror" and posted it on the blackboard newspaper. The soldiers read the blackboard newspaper and were deeply moved by the company commander's spirit of daring to criticize himself. They all followed the company commander's example, each making a red "bedhead mirror."

One mirror after another, the dormitory was illuminated in red, and people's hearts were illuminated in red...

    照镜子
    齐明昌
    炮兵连连长李进京的床头，挂着一面很别致的“镜子”，李连长称它是“床头镜”。“镜子”的左边写着：本人缺点；右边写着：毛主席的教导。李连长每天都要对着“镜子”反复擦拭自己思想上的尘垢。
    “床头镜”是咋来的呢？
    今年夏天一个星期日的清晨，战士们起床后，经过一阵激烈的“战斗”，宿舍里的玻璃和地板，擦得铮明瓦亮；一切用具都摆得整整齐齐。金灿灿的阳光照进宿舍里，使人感到格外舒畅。
    李连长从宿舍这头踱到那头，满意的笑容在脸上漾了开来。可是，当他走进驭手班的宿舍，面色登时阴了下来。驭手班的同志们还在蒙头酣睡。李连长的脾气，扔到棉花上都炸，一看到这种情况就火了。他对驭手班的战士们大声喊：“起床！”
    战士们立刻“腾”地坐了起来。
    连长很不客气地说：“全连就数你们驭手班作风稀拉。虽然是星期天，也不能太阳晒到屁股上了还不起床啊！”驭手班长对连长说：“这不能怪同志们，我们班——”
    “你们班应该从思想上好好查查原因。”连长打断驭手班长的话批评道。
    连长的几句话，说得战士们都耷拉了脑袋。
    晚上点名，连长为了使其它班引以为戒，又把驭手班批评了一顿。不料，连长这一顿批评，引起了一场风波。
    第二天下午操课归来，连长还没有走进连部，就听见文书聂瑞林粗喉咙大嗓门地嚷道：“驭手班不虚心接受批评，还乱开炮，真是乱弹琴！”
    连长走进连部，问文书：“出啥事了？”文书递给连长一张纸条说：“喏，你自己看吧。”
    连长接过纸条，只见上面写着：
    “连长办事太主观，
    驭手晚起有根缘。
    不调查没有发言权，
    调查之后再发言。
                  驭手班战士”
    在这条意见的旁边，还用红笔写着一条毛主席语录：
    “有许多人，‘下车伊始’，就哇喇哇喇地发议论，提意见，这也批评，那也指责，其实这种人十个有十个要失败。”
    连长平时处理问题有些主观，但他还特别怕别人批评自己主观。今天，驭手班提出的这条意见，深深地刺到了连长的痛处。连长的脑袋有些大了。他觉得：自己熟悉连里每个战士就像熟悉自己掌中的指纹一样，咋能说自己没有“发言权”？再说昨天驭手班晚起床，自己都亲眼看到了，还用得着调查？连长有些恼火了。猛地，毛主席的话，在他的耳畔响了起来：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”毛主席的教导，使连长冷静下来。昨天的事情，自己果真处理得妥当吗？他对照驭手班送来的那条语录，检查起来。越检查越觉得自己对这件事的处理有问题：自己光知道驭手班起床晚了，但究竟为啥起床晚了呢？确实缺乏调查研究。
    当天晚上，连长带着那条意见来到了驭手班，虚心地倾听了战士们的批评。原来，那天夜里，连里有一匹军马得了重病，驭手班的同志们，请兽医，给马灌药，整整折腾了一宿，天亮时才睡下。因而，第二天误了起床。这天晚上点名，连长表扬了驭手班“星夜救军马”的忘我的工作精神，诚恳地检查自己犯了主观主义的毛病。他说：“以前，我总认为自己生活在连队里，还用得着调查研究？驭手班这一炮轰得好，打中了要害；驭手班这条语录也送得好，正是给我治病的良药。以后，你们看我哪些地方不符合毛主席的指示，就尽管开炮……”
    全连一阵热烈的掌声，淹没了连长的声音。
    会完以后，熄灯号早已响过了，连长却全无睡意。他坐在灯下，拿着驭手班的意见和送来的语录，反复端详、反复琢磨。忽然，他觉得心头一阵豁亮，一阵喜悦爬上眉梢。他找了张硬纸，剪成了一个镜子大小的方块，把驭手班的那条意见和毛主席语录，一笔一划、工工整整地抄在上面。也不知是过于认真还是因为天气太热，连长写了百十个字，竟出了一身大汗。
    连长写完，把镜子大的硬纸牌挂在床头上。文书在旁边看了半天，也没弄清连长的意图。忍不住问道：“连长搞这硬纸片儿干啥？”连长说：“把毛主席的教导当做一面镜子，天天对照检查自己的思想，永远按毛主席的指示办事。”连长的话，像钢珠落在银盘上，铮铮作响。
    第二天，文书把连长做“床头镜”的故事写了篇稿子，登在黑板报上。战士们看了黑板报，深深地为连长勇于自我批评的精神所感动，也都学着连长的样子，一人做了一面红彤彤的“床头镜”。
    一面面“床头镜”，把宿舍映得通红通亮，把人们的心照得通红通亮……
