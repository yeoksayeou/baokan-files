Chairman Mao said: We all come from the four corners of the country, united for a common revolutionary goal. ... All revolutionaries must care for, love, and help each other.

For the Revolution, Strengthen Unity

	Yang Guifang (Director of the Women's Congress of the Production Brigade): In the old society, it was "money and rice for husbands and wives, wine and food for friends." "With money and wine, there are many brothers; without money and rice, one is alone." In the new society, we unite for the revolution, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to strengthen unity.

	Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no revolutionary unity. In the past, I did not study Chairman Mao's works. In the Mao Tang Production Brigade, I often quarreled with others. If someone scolded me once, I would scold them back twice. After one quarrel, we became sworn enemies. In this way, I almost alienated the masses.

	During the socialist education movement, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I thought: "People from all over the country must unite. How can I, a class brother and sister in the production brigade, not unite and still talk about revolution?" Thinking of the revolution, I thought of unity. My sister-in-law, Yang Shichun, and I are both from poor peasant families. We just quarreled once and became enemies. In the past, some comrades advised me to unite with her, but I said, "I won't bother with her!" After hearing Chairman Mao's words, I took the initiative to unite with her. The first time, I called her under the pretext of borrowing a basket, but she scolded me. I thought of not calling her again, but then I thought of the revolution and that we are class sisters, so I called her a second time. She still didn't pay attention to me. The third time, her husband returned from the factory, and I asked her husband to help her study Chairman Mao's works. Later, when I called her again, she was much better. Recently, while I was studying at the party school, my two children at home had no one to take care of, and the pigs had no one to feed, so she took the initiative to help me with household chores and take care of the children. In the Mao Tang Production Brigade, I used to quarrel with more than ten people and didn't speak to seven people. Now, everyone studies Chairman Mao's works, each person reflects on their own shortcomings, cares for and helps each other, and unity is strengthened. The masses see that I have made progress, and their opinions of me have decreased. They even elected me as the director of the Women's Congress of the Production Brigade.

	Chen Guan (Deputy Director of the Production Brigade): The masses of the production brigade all know that I have a bad temper, "one word, two scoldings." Yang Jichun and I are neighbors, and we often quarrel over trivial matters, such as a chicken weighing only four taels. At that time, I was the director of the Women's Congress of the Production Brigade, and my husband was the secretary of the brigade party committee. He often advised me to take the initiative to unite with Yang Jichun. Comrades from higher levels also repeatedly educated me to take the initiative to unite. I said, "I obey the leadership in everything, but I don't obey when it comes to bowing down to her and yielding to her." In this way, I treated comrades as enemies for many years. This year, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I was shocked. Chairman Mao's words seemed to be directed at me. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that my previous thoughts were wrong. In the past, I only thought of personal pride and did not think of the revolution. Yang Jichun is a poor peasant, and I am a cadre. I have the responsibility to unite with her. If we can unite the revolutionary forces, the cause of socialism will develop faster. Once the thought is enlightened, I took the initiative to reflect, cared for Yang Jichun in her life, and helped her politically. She is illiterate, so I helped her read Chairman Mao's books. Now, she often studies Chairman Mao's works with me, and we chat and laugh together, like a family. Some women say, "Why has Chen Guan's temper improved?" I say, "After hearing Chairman Mao's words, everyone will change!"

### 为了革命  搞好团结

专栏：

    毛主席说：我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。
    为了革命  搞好团结
    杨桂芳（大队妇代会主任）：旧社会，是“钱米的夫妻，酒饭的朋友”，“有钱有酒多兄弟，无钱无米一个人”；在新社会，是为了革命搞好团结，依靠毛泽东思想搞好团结。
    没有毛泽东思想，就没有革命的团结。过去，我没有学习毛主席著作，在毛塘生产队常常和人家吵架。谁骂我一句，我就要骂他两句。吵一次架，就成了“冤家对头”。就这样，把群众快脱离光了。
    在社会主义教育运动中，我学习了《为人民服务》。我想：“来自五湖四海的人都要团结，我和一个生产队的阶级兄弟姐妹还不团结，怎么能够革命呀！”想到革命，就想团结了。我和弟媳杨时春，两家都是贫农，只是骂了一次架，就结下了仇。过去有的同志要我和她搞好团结，我说：“我才不去理她呢！”听了毛主席的话以后，我就主动去搞好团结。第一次，我以借箩为名喊她，她把我骂了。我想不再喊她了，但是一想起革命，想起都是阶级姐妹，我又第二次去喊她，她还是不理我。第三次，她丈夫从工厂回来了，我就要她丈夫帮助她学习毛主席著作。以后，我再去喊她时，她就蛮好了。最近，我在党校学习，家里两个小孩，没有人照顾，猪没人喂，她就主动帮助我料理家务，照顾小孩。在毛塘生产队，过去我和十多个人吵了架，和七个人不讲话；现在，大家都学习毛主席著作，各人检讨自己的缺点，互相关心，互相帮助，搞好了团结。群众看我进步了，对我的意见也就少了，还选我当了大队妇代会主任。
    陈鸾（副大队长）：生产队群众都晓得我脾气不好，“一句话，两句骂”。阳继鸾和我对门对户，一个大门出进，就是为了一只四两重的鸡，打了一架，两人总是你眼不对我眼。那时我是大队妇代会主任，我爱人是大队支部书记。他常劝我主动去喊阳继鸾；上级来帮助工作的同志，也多次教育我主动去搞好团结。我说：“事事我都服从领导，就是要我在她面前低头，拜她的下风，这一条我不服从。”就这样，多年来，把亲人当作仇人。今年，学习了《为人民服务》，我吃了一惊。毛主席的话好像都是针对我说的。我越想越觉得原来的想法错了。过去只想个人争强好胜，不去想革命。阳继鸾是贫农，我是干部，我有责任去团结她。能够团结好革命的力量，社会主义事业发展就快了。思想一开窍，就主动作了检讨，对阳继鸾从生活上关心，从政治上帮助。她不识字，我帮助她读毛主席的书。现在，她经常和我一起学习毛主席著作，互相有说有笑，亲如一家了。有些妇女说：“陈鸾的脾气现在怎么变好了？”我说：“听了毛主席的话，人人都要变样呀！”
