According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on October 31, Vietnamese Deputy Chief of Mission to China, Le Cong Chi, held a press conference tonight. He strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for plotting the "Manila Conference" to further escalate their aggression against Vietnam. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' actions to escalate the war fully expose their lies about "seeking peace," "seeking peaceful solutions," and "peace talks," which are all deceitful rhetoric aimed at fooling the world's people.

Le Cong Chi emphasized that the U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemies of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people, united as one, harbor deep hatred and are determined to follow Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call: to endure hardships and sacrifices, and to fight resolutely until complete victory.

At the press conference, Le Cong Chi distributed a statement from the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's committee investigating U.S. imperialist crimes in the Vietnam War. He told the domestic and foreign journalists present that this statement is a powerful indictment of the crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists.

The Deputy Chief of Mission said in his speech that the recent war conference held in Manila by the U.S., the Saigon puppet regime, and some other U.S. lackeys clearly shows that they are stepping up preparations for new and extremely serious escalations in the war of aggression. However, at the Manila war conference, in the United Nations, and during U.S. President Johnson's recent tour, they repeatedly claim to be against "aggression" and "seeking peace." But facts are facts. The U.S. has committed crimes in Vietnam that heaven and earth cannot tolerate. No matter how cunning their deceptive arguments or methods, they cannot deceive the world's people.

The Deputy Chief of Mission said that it is not the Vietnamese people who have invaded the U.S., and it is foolish to think that the people of North Vietnam are invading the people of South Vietnam. The fact is that over 330,000 U.S. troops and 50,000 mercenaries are killing the people of South Vietnam, and the U.S. air force and navy are bombing the independent and sovereign Democratic Republic of Vietnam day and night. The U.S. government has committed the crime of aggression, which is a crime against humanity that has been severely condemned by the international community.

The Deputy Chief of Mission said that the U.S. government is a war criminal. War criminals like Johnson and others must be tried by the court of world public opinion.

The Deputy Chief of Mission expressed gratitude for the Chinese people's consistent and resolute condemnation of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle. He pointed out that China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons has greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people in their fight.

    越驻华使馆临时代办谴责马尼拉会议的阴谋
    越南人民万众一心坚决战斗到胜利
    中国导弹核武器试验成功对越南人民是巨大鼓舞
    据新华社三十一日讯  越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始今晚在他举行的记者招待会上，强烈谴责美帝国主义策划召开“马尼拉会议”，为进一步扩大侵略越南作了罪恶的准备。他指出，美帝国主义的战争升级行动，充分暴露了它散布的“谋求和平”、“寻求和平解决的办法”、“和平谈判”等论调，完全是欺骗世界人民的鬼话。
    黎终始临时代办强调说，美帝国主义是越南人民不共戴天的死敌。越南人民万众一心，怀着深仇大恨，竭尽全力来实现胡志明主席的号召：不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到完全胜利。
    黎终始临时代办在招待会上散发了越南民主共和国关于美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中的罪恶调查委员会的声明。他向中外记者指出，这个声明是对美帝国主义所犯罪行的强有力的控诉书。
    临时代办在讲话中说，美国、西贡伪政权和美国的其他一些仆从国不久前在马尼拉召开的战争会议清楚地表明，它们正加紧准备在侵略战争中作出新的极其严重的战争升级。可是，美国在马尼拉战争会议中和在联合国中，以及在美国总统约翰逊的这次周游中，却不断自称它们是反对“侵略”和“谋求和平”的。然而事实终归是事实，美国已在越南犯下了天地不能容的罪行，不管它使用多么狡诈的骗人论调或手段，都是欺骗不了世界人民的。
    临时代办说，不是越南人民侵犯了美国，也不能愚蠢地认为北方的越南人民侵略南方的越南人民，事实是三十三万多名美军和五万名帮凶军正在杀害越南南方人民，美国空军和海军正在日夜轰炸独立和拥有主权的越南民主共和国。美国政府已犯了侵略之罪，这是人类已经严厉谴责的国际罪。
    临时代办说，美国政府是战争罪犯。战犯头子约翰逊等必须受到世界舆论法庭的审判。
    临时代办表示感谢中国人民始终如一地坚决和愤怒地谴责美帝国主义侵略者，坚决支持越南人民的斗争。他指出，中国发射导弹核武器试验成功，对战斗中的越南人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。
