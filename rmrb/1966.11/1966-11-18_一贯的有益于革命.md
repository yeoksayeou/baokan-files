	Consistently Beneficial to the Revolution
	Jiang Qihua, Squad Leader of the Fifth Squad, Zhejiang Provincial Military Region

	I remember one night in August. I was on duty. As I walked out of the dormitory, I saw someone sitting under the streetlight, holding a book in one hand and supporting his head with the other, deep in thought. I walked a few steps forward and recognized Cai Yongxiang. I thought to myself, "Cai Yongxiang, this little tiger, doesn't he ever get tired? This afternoon, he skipped his nap to help me and the other comrades wash more than twenty pieces of clothing. After lights out, he stood another watch. Now it's so late, and he's still studying!"

	I walked up to him and called out, "Cai Yongxiang!" He stood up abruptly, "Yes!" I asked him why he wasn't resting. He softly replied, "I can't sleep without reading Chairman Mao's book." I was about to persuade him to go back and rest, but before I could speak, he pulled me by the hand and said, "Squad Leader, look, Chairman Mao's words are so wise!" I moved closer to see, and it was a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "It is not difficult for a person to do some good deeds, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, not to do evil, to be consistently beneficial to the broad masses, to be consistently beneficial to the youth, to be consistently beneficial to the revolution, to strive hard for decades like one day. This is the most difficult, the most difficult!"

	Reading this passage, a warm current immediately surged to my heart. I said, "Indeed, doing some good deeds is easy, but doing good deeds all one's life is truly difficult!" Cai Yongxiang shook his head and said, "No, as long as one truly loves Chairman Mao and truly listens to Chairman Mao's words, one can definitely do it!" I heard this and suddenly understood why Cai Yongxiang had done so many good deeds.

	Now, Cai Yongxiang has used his blood and life to practice his resolve. His life, though short, was a life "consistently beneficial to the revolution," "consistently beneficial to the broad masses," a life of glory.

    一贯的有益于革命
    浙江省军区某部五班班长　蒋其华
    记得今年八月的一个深夜，我去执勤。走出寝室门，只见路灯下面坐着个人，一手捧着书本，一手托着头，在想着什么。我向前走了两步，才看清楚是蔡永祥同志。我心里在叨念：“蔡永祥，你这个小老虎，难道就不知疲倦吗？今天中午，放弃了午睡，帮助我和其他同志洗了二十多件衣服；晚上熄灯以后，又站了一班岗；现在这么迟了，还在学习！”
    我走到他的面前，喊了一声：“蔡永祥！”他霍地站了起来，“有！”我问他为什么还不休息？他轻轻地说：“我不读一读毛主席的书，睡不着。”我正想劝他回去休息，话还未出口，他一把拉着我的手，说：“五班长，你看，毛主席讲得多英明啊！”我走拢去一看，原来是这样一段毛主席语录：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众，一贯的有益于青年，一贯的有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！”
    读了这段语录，一股暖流马上涌向心头。我说：“确实是这样，做点好事容易，一辈子做好事，可真难呵！”蔡永祥摇摇头说：“不，只要真正热爱毛主席，真正听毛主席的话，就一定能做到！”我听了心里一下明白了，怪不得蔡永祥同志做了那么多的好事。
    如今，蔡永祥同志用鲜血和生命，实践了他的决心。他的一生，虽然是短暂的，但却是“一贯的有益于革命”，“一贯的有益于广大群众”的一生，是光辉的一生。
