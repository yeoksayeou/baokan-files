Some advanced producers and old workers from Shenyang Transformer Factory said at a meeting: Seizing the revolution and promoting production is a combat mission given by Chairman Mao.

All the workers in the factory have directed the revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Cultural Revolution towards production, completing the annual production task two months ahead of schedule.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 15th: Some advanced producers and old workers from Shenyang Transformer Factory, at a meeting to study the editorial "On Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production" from the People's Daily, unanimously expressed that seizing the revolution and promoting production is the combat mission given to us by our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao. We must engrave Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, absorb them into our blood, and implement them in our actions. We must shoulder the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and vow to be the main force of the Cultural Revolution and the vanguard of production struggles.

In early September, when the Cultural Revolution in this factory reached its peak, Lu Songhai, Chang Huanzhong, Luo Guihong, Wang Feng'en, and thirteen other old workers, through studying the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, proposed to all the workers in the factory to seize the revolution and promote production. This proposal by the thirteen old workers was enthusiastically responded to by all the revolutionary workers in the factory. They came early and left late, using their spare time to write big-character posters, exposing a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and criticizing the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie entrenched in technical leadership positions. The broad masses of workers directed the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution towards production. They voluntarily guarded their production posts, treating the workshop as a battlefield and the machine tools as weapons, striving to produce. In September alone, they completed the production task equivalent to two months in the first half of the year. By the end of October, they had completed the annual production task of transformers two months ahead of schedule, with a production volume more than 20% higher than the entire previous year.

Wang Feng'en, a worker engineer from this factory, a famous labor model in Shenyang City, and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: Chairman Mao's directive to seize the revolution and promote production is the highest instruction guiding us to do a better job in production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, our production is a battle on the material front, competing for time and level with imperialism and modern revisionism. This is a major issue concerning the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We must, like the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the heroes of the 32111 drilling team, firmly guard our production posts. The old workers and advanced producers at the meeting used many vivid examples to illustrate: "One's head may be cut off, one's blood may be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be abandoned." The key to seizing the revolution and promoting production lies in persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They expressed their determination to learn from the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as instructed by Comrade Lin Biao, focusing on practical application. No matter how tight the time, how heavy the production tasks, or how many and how great the difficulties, with Mao Zedong Thought, we can seize time, overcome difficulties, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Now, this factory has seen a new mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of workers have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, carrying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with them, studying them at all times and in all matters, taking the revolutionary spirit of Zhang Zedong and Bai Qiuen as their learning examples, striving to produce more transformers in the next forty-plus days, and contribute their strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

    沈阳变压器厂部分先进生产者和老工人在座谈会上说：
    抓革命促生产是毛主席交给的战斗任务
    全厂职工把文化大革命中焕发起来的革命干劲用到生产上，提前两月完成全年生产任务
    据新华社沈阳十五日电　沈阳变压器厂部分先进生产者和老工人，在学习《人民日报》社论《再论抓革命促生产》的座谈会上一致表示：抓革命，促生产，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的战斗任务。我们一定要把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，肩负起革命和生产两副重担，以伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，誓作文化大革命的主力军，生产斗争的突击队。
    九月初，这个工厂的文化大革命进入高潮的时候，吕宋海、常焕忠、罗桂荣、王凤恩等十三位老工人，通过学习中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定和党的八届十一中全会公报，向全厂职工提出了抓革命促生产的倡议。这十三名老工人的倡议，得到全厂革命职工的热烈响应。他们早来晚走，利用业余时间写大字报，揭发一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，批判盘踞在技术领导岗位上的资产阶级反动“权威”。广大职工把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天革命干劲，用到生产上去。他们自觉地坚守生产岗位，把车间当战场，把机床当武器，努力生产。九月份一个月，他们就完成了相当于上半年两个月的生产任务，到十月末，他们已经提前两个月，完成了全年的变压器生产任务，产量比去年全年还多百分之二十以上。
    这个工厂的工人工程师、沈阳市著名劳动模范、学习毛主席著作积极分子王凤恩说：毛主席提出的抓革命，促生产的方针，是指导我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，把生产搞得好上加好的最高指示。他说，我们搞生产，这是在物质战线上，同帝国主义、现代修正主义抢时间、抢水平的战斗，这是关系到中国革命和世界革命的大问题。我们要像解放军战士那样，要像32111钻井队的英雄们那样，坚守生产岗位。老工人和先进生产者们，在座谈会上，用很多生动事例说明：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢。抓革命，促生产的关键，在于坚持活学活用毛主席著作。他们表示要像林彪同志指示的那样，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，在用字上狠下功夫，那怕时间再紧，生产任务再重，困难再多、再大，有了毛泽东思想，就能争取时间，战胜困难，夺取革命和生产双胜利。
    现在这个工厂，已经出现了一个新的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。广大职工热烈响应林彪同志的号召，随身带着“老三篇”，时时学，事事学，以张思德、白求恩的革命精神，作为自己学习的榜样，争取在今后的四十多天里，增产更多的变压器，为中国革命和世界革命贡献自己的力量。
