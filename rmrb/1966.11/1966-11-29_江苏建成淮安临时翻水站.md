More than six thousand workers, peasants, and cadres from Jiangsu Province, after a half-month of arduous struggle, have completed the Huai'an Temporary Water Transfer Station. This station uses water from the Yangtze River, diverted through the Liyun River, to irrigate vast areas of drought-affected farmland in the Huaibei Plain.

The water transfer station is equipped with 8,000 horsepower pumping facilities. It draws water from the Yangtze River via the Jiangdu Pumping Station and transfers it to the Liyun River, pumping it at a rate of 50 cubic meters per second to higher elevations. The water is then delivered to the Huaibei Plain, ensuring irrigation for over 2 million mu of autumn-sown fields and more than 100,000 mu of late-season rice that were severely affected by drought in the Huaiyin Prefecture. Additionally, the industrial water supply for Qingjiang City in the Huaibei Plain is now secured.

    江苏建成淮安临时翻水站
    江苏省六千多工人、农民和干部，经过半个月艰苦奋战，建成了淮安临时翻水站，用来自长江的里运河的水，灌溉了淮北平原的大片受旱农田。
    这个翻水站拥有八千马力的抽水设备，它把江都抽水机站从长江引到里运河的水，以每秒钟五十立方米的速度往高处翻，然后输送到淮北平原，使淮阴专区遭受严重干旱的两百多万亩秋播用地和十多万亩晚稻得到灌溉；淮北平原的清江市的工业用水也有了保证。
