	Editor's Note: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is crucial for the broad masses of Red Guards, revolutionary youth, revolutionary teachers and staff, and all revolutionary people to follow the example of the People's Liberation Army in implementing the Three-Eight Style and strictly adhering to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. This will ensure the success of this unprecedented cultural revolution. To help everyone learn and implement the Three-Eight Style and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, today's newspaper reprints the songs "Song of the Three-Eight Style" and "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" for everyone to sing.

	"The Song of the Three-Eight Style" and "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" are marching songs sung by all soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have these teachings of Chairman Mao in their minds and hearts, and they put them into practice. They strictly follow the Three-Eight Style, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and advance courageously in the political direction indicated by Chairman Mao. They strictly adhere to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and through long-term revolutionary struggles, they have become a people's army that is both democratic and highly disciplined. We learn from the People's Liberation Army to become a revolutionary force that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is both democratic and highly disciplined.

	The Three-Eight Style and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention are the revolutionary treasures of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary treasures of the Chinese people, and also the revolutionary treasures that all revolutionary youth must inherit and carry forward. We must sing the songs "Song of the Three-Eight Style" and "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and forever follow Chairman Mao's instructions.

    三八作风歌
    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命中，像解放军一样贯彻执行三八作风，坚决遵守三大纪律八项注意，是广大红卫兵和革命青少年、革命的教职员工及一切革命群众搞好这场史无前例的文化大革命的重要保障。为了帮助大家学习、执行三八作风和三大纪律八项注意，今天本报再一次发表《三八作风歌》和《三大纪律八项注意》两首歌曲，供大家演唱。
    《三八作风歌》和《三大纪律八项注意》，是解放军广大指战员人人唱、天天唱的队列歌曲。解放军指战员把毛主席的这些教导，唱在口头，记在心头，落实在行动里头。他们认真实行“三八作风”，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，沿着毛主席指引的政治方向奋勇前进。他们坚决遵守三大纪律八项注意，在长期的革命斗争中锻炼成为一支既有广泛的民主，又有高度的组织纪律性的人民军队。我们向解放军学习，就是要像解放军那样，成为一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，既有广泛民主，又有高度的组织纪律性的革命化的队伍。
    三八作风和三大纪律八项注意，是解放军的革命传家宝，是我国人民的革命传家宝，也是广大革命青少年必须继承和发扬的革命传家宝。我们要高唱《三八作风歌》、《三大纪律八项注意》这两首歌曲，永远照毛主席的这些指示办事，我们要把这个革命传家宝千秋万代地传下去！
