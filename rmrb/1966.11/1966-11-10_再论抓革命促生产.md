The Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is for the purpose of making people's ideology revolutionary, and thus making all work done better, more, faster, and more economically. As long as the masses are fully mobilized and arrangements are made properly, it is possible to ensure that the cultural revolution and production will not be neglected, and to ensure high quality in all work."

The decision also points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. It is wrong to oppose the cultural revolution to the development of production."

The policy put forward by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students and teachers. The whole country is full of vigorous revolutionary scenes. The situation of industrial and agricultural production is very good.

A large number of facts prove that wherever the policy of grasping the revolution and promoting production is firmly implemented, the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses are high, and production rises. If production is grasped without revolution, or conversely, revolution is grasped without production, both are contrary to Chairman Mao's policy, and neither is beneficial to the cultural revolution nor to the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Over the past five months, the broad masses of workers and peasants have actively participated in this great proletarian cultural revolution. We should sum up the experience of the previous stage well, in conjunction with the socialist education movement, and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution in cities and countryside better. The proletarian cultural revolution in cities and countryside should be carried out actively, in phases and in batches. In regions and units where the proletarian cultural revolution is being carried out, it is necessary to adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line with Comrade Mao Zedong as the representative, follow the requirements of the Party Central Committee's sixteen points, further mobilize the masses, raise the consciousness of the masses, overcome various obstacles, resolutely oppose the suppression of the masses and retaliatory actions, eliminate the pernicious influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, concentrate forces to overthrow a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and sweep away all monsters and demons.

Of course, the conditions for carrying out the cultural revolution in production units in cities and countryside are not exactly the same as in schools. In order to carry out the cultural revolution, schools can temporarily stop classes and engage in internal and external linkages. However, in industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and people's communes, production must not be stopped. A slight interruption in industrial and agricultural production will affect the economic life of the people. The national economy is a whole, industrial production is a whole, one link affects another, and if one part is disconnected, it may affect the whole. This is a matter within the scope of common sense, and everyone will understand it. Therefore, in industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and rural areas, the cultural revolution must be carried out in time outside of production, using spare time, and not occupying production time, not leaving the production post. One must consciously abide by labor discipline. Any behavior that affects production will have serious consequences. Workers and peasants can report to their superiors, to the Central Committee, the situation and put forward opinions. But they should not go to other places to link up. As for the relevant enterprises in the same city, and the neighboring people's communes, exchanging experiences with each other is normal and necessary.

Revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants, learn from the workers and peasants, and participate in production labor in a planned way, conduct various investigations and research, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's correct line and the sixteen points of the cultural revolution to the masses.

Revolutionary students should firmly believe that the workers and peasants are able to rise up and revolutionize themselves and solve their own problems, and no one can do it for them. They should also pay special attention not to interfere from the outside with the production activities and production arrangements of industry and agriculture.

In order to ensure that the revolution and production do not interfere with each other, it is necessary to learn to lead and strengthen leadership. Not for a moment should the leadership of production be interrupted. All units carrying out the cultural revolution should, according to the regulations of the Central Committee, form two teams under unified leadership. One team leads the cultural revolution, and one team leads production, with division of labor and cooperation, and not acting on their own. The leadership of the cultural revolution should be elected democratically according to the method of the Paris Commune. The team leading production, if it was originally sound or basically sound, should take better responsibility for leadership. If problems are found, they should be appropriately solved. In short, we must learn to carry out the cultural revolution well while carrying out production better, better, and better!

It is clear that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will make the ideology of the Chinese people more rapidly and highly revolutionary. No matter where, no matter what unit, as long as the cultural revolution is seriously and not carelessly, earnestly and not casually, it will certainly greatly promote the production enthusiasm of the masses, greatly promote the new leap in industrial and agricultural production and scientific and technological progress!

### 再论抓革命促生产

    再论抓革命促生产
    抓革命，促生产，这是毛主席提出的方针，一再强调的方针。这个方针，不论在城市工矿企业、事业单位里面，在一切科学研究机构和设计部门里面，在农村里面，都是完全适用的，没有例外的，必须坚决遵守、时刻遵守的。
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。只要充分发动群众，妥善安排，就能够保证文化革命和生产两不误，保证各项工作的高质量。”
    决定还指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。把文化大革命同发展生产对立起来，这种看法是不对的。”
    毛主席和党中央提出的这个方针，受到了广大工农群众、革命干部和革命师生的热烈拥护。全国到处是蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。工农业生产的形势好得很。
    大量的事实证明，凡是坚决贯彻抓革命、促生产的方针的地方，那里群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性就很高，那里的生产就上升。如果只抓生产不抓革命，或者相反，只抓革命不抓生产，都是违背毛主席的方针的，既不利于文化革命，又不利于工农业生产的发展。
    五个月来，广大工农群众积极投入了这场伟大的无产阶级文化革命运动。我们应当很好地总结前一阶段的经验，结合社会主义教育运动，把城乡无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。城乡的无产阶级文化大革命应当积极地、分期分批地进行。在开展无产阶级文化大革命的地区和单位，一定要遵循以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，按照党中央十六条的要求，进一步发动群众，提高群众的觉悟，克服各种阻力，坚决反对压制群众和打击报复的行为，肃清资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响，集中力量斗垮一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    当然，在城乡生产单位搞文化革命，同学校搞文化革命，条件是不完全一样的。为着闹文化革命，学校可以暂时停课，搞内外大串连。而在工矿企业、事业单位和人民公社，却绝对不能停止生产。工农业生产稍有间断，就会影响到人民的经济生活。国民经济是一个整体，工业生产是一个整体，一个环节扣一个环节，只要某一部门脱节，就可能影响全局。这是常识范围内的事情，谁都会懂得的。因此，在工矿企业、事业单位和农村里搞文化革命，必须在生产以外的时间进行，利用业余时间进行，而不能占用生产的时间，不能离开生产岗位。要自觉地遵守劳动纪律。任何影响生产的行为，都会带来严重的后果。工农群众可以向上级，向中央，反映情况，提出意见。但决不应该到外地去串连。至于本城市的有关企业，以及邻近的人民公社，相互交流经验，那是正常的，必要的。
    革命的学生，革命的知识分子，必须同工农群众结合，向工农群众学习，并且要有计划地参加生产劳动，做各种调查研究，向群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的正确路线，宣传文化革命的十六条。
    革命的学生，应当坚信工农群众是能够自己起来闹革命，自己解决自己的问题的，谁也不能包办代替。还要特别注意，不要从外头去干预工业农业的生产活动和生产部署。
    为了使得革命和生产两不误，一定要学会领导，加强领导。一刻也不能中断对生产的领导。凡是开展文化革命的单位，都要按照中央的规定，在统一领导下，组成两个班子。一个班子领导文化革命，一个班子领导生产，既分工，又合作，不要各自为政。文化革命的领导，要按照巴黎公社的办法，民主选举文化革命委员会。领导生产的班子，如果原来的是健全的，或者基本是健全的，他们应当更好地担负起领导的责任来。如果发现有问题，就应当适当地解决。总之，我们必须学会在搞好文化大革命的同时，把生产搞得更好，更好，更好！
    十分明白，无产阶级文化大革命将使我国人民的思想更迅速、更高度地革命化。不论什么地方，什么单位，只要认真地而不是马虎地，严肃地而不是草率地，抓好文化大革命，就必然大大促进群众的生产积极性，大大促进工农业生产和科学技术的新飞跃！
