The people of Zanzibar, drinking water, remember the source and will never forget Chairman Mao.

The Chinese water exploration team, with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, arrived in Zanzibar, Tanzania. They searched for water sources for the people of Zanzibar. In just over a year, they traversed countless villages and wildernesses in Zanzibar and successfully drilled thirteen deep wells. Whenever a white water column spurted from the ground in a place, farmers from far and near celebrated it as a great joy, singing and dancing to congratulate, and personally tasting the "sweet water" drilled by the Chinese experts. They clapped and jumped, shouting, "Thank you, New China! Thank you, Mao Zedong!"

A high-ranking official of the Tanzanian government, upon visiting the drilling site, was very excited and said, "Drinking water and remembering the source, the people of Zanzibar will never forget the kindness of Mao Zedong sending Chinese experts to us for generations to come."

The small island of Zanzibar, surrounded by the blue sea, has always lacked fresh water, seriously affecting the production and life of the people.

The members of the Chinese water exploration team left their homeland with the wish to support the world revolution and serve the people of Zanzibar wholeheartedly. Soon after their arrival, before the fatigue of the journey had recovered, they put on their work clothes and worked for eighteen consecutive days on the heavy physical labor of the port dock, personally moving over five hundred tons of drilling equipment and materials from the port to the workshop and construction site.

The team members of the Chinese water exploration team traveled long distances and slept under the open sky in this foreign land, conducting intense exploration work. However, no matter how busy the work was, no matter how difficult the conditions were, the Chinese experts always made time to study Chairman Mao's works. They enthusiastically said, "The more sweat we shed here, the greater the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought here." Many Zanzibari friends were deeply moved by this and enthusiastically praised, "From you, we see the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong."

After successfully completing the initial drilling of several wells, new difficulties arose: a type of gravel needed to fill the wells during completion could not be found in Tanzania. It was said that only one British drilling company in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, had this material in the entire East Africa. In this situation, the Chinese water exploration team, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "self-reliance" and "hard struggle," would not beg from the colonialists. They consulted with the engineering departments of Zanzibar and decided to rely on their own strength to find a way to obtain local materials. They searched the entire island and finally found a similar type of gravel in the seashore near Zanzibar City that could be used as a substitute. However, this gravel was mixed with sea sand and had to be scooped out from the sea to be sieved. This required a great deal of labor. What to do? Following Chairman Mao's teachings, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." At that time, Zanzibar was in the hottest season, the scorching sun burned the skin off their backs, causing sores, and the salty sea water made it unbearable. Under the encouragement of Chairman Mao's teachings, they persisted in the struggle, scooping up dozens of tons of gravel, ensuring the needs of the project. The Zanzibari students working with the Chinese experts were deeply moved by the Chinese experts' revolutionary spirit of enduring hardships and labor. They praised, "You are truly experts sent by Chairman Mao." "You are the model for us to work hard."

In the southern part of Zanzibar Island, in the village of Mujuni, several thousand residents had long hoped to drill a well in the village to solve the water problem. The Chinese experts, after seven days and nights of intense labor, drilled out the water, but it was salty! The villagers were greatly disappointed. The Chinese experts' mood was also not calm. They reviewed Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," using the spirit of "serving the people thoroughly" to demand of themselves. They relied on collective wisdom to conduct meticulous rock layer analysis and found the location of the salty water layer. They successfully blocked the salty water layer in the well using "local" methods, preventing the infiltration of salty water. Sweet and fresh water was finally obtained! The villagers were overjoyed and spread the news. They praised the Chinese experts for having "technology and wisdom," "turning salty water into fresh water, creating a miracle." Many villagers tightly held the hands of the Chinese experts and enthusiastically shouted, "China, Mao Zedong, great! Thank you so much!"

The Chinese water exploration team always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and strove to help the people of Zanzibar walk the path of self-reliance. They made do with the available resources and combined them with practical work. In a short period, they trained twenty-five water exploration technicians in Zanzibar who had the ability to work independently. East Africa thus had its own African drilling team. The first vice president of Tanzania, Karume, called on the Zanzibari students to "learn not only the technology from the Chinese experts but also the excellent qualities and good style of the Chinese experts."

    桑给巴尔人民饮水思源永远不忘毛主席
    中国水源勘探队怀着无产阶级国际主义精神来到了坦桑尼亚的桑给巴尔。他们为了给桑给巴尔人民寻找水源，在短短十多个月里，走遍了桑给巴尔的无数农村和荒野，成功地钻探了十三眼深水井。每逢一个地方白色的水柱喷出地面，远近的农民都把它当成大喜事，载歌载舞前来庆贺，亲口尝一尝中国专家给钻出的“甜水”。他们鼓掌跳跃，欢呼“感谢新中国，感谢毛泽东！”
    坦桑尼亚政府一位高级官员在参观钻井工地时曾十分激动地说：“饮水思源，我们桑给巴尔人民世世代代都永远忘不了毛泽东给我们派来中国专家的恩情。”
    桑给巴尔这个碧海环抱的小岛，一直缺少淡水，严重地影响了人民的生产和生活。
    中国水源勘探队的同志们是抱着支援世界革命和全心全意为桑给巴尔人民服务的心愿离开祖国，来到桑给巴尔岛的。他们到达后不久，旅途的疲劳还没有恢复，就换上工作服在港口码头一连干了十八天沉重的体力劳动，亲自动手把五百多吨钻井用的设备器材从港口运到车间和工地。
    中国水源勘探队的队员们在这异国的土地上长途跋涉、餐风宿露，进行紧张的勘探工作。但是，无论工作怎样繁忙，无论条件怎样艰苦，中国专家们都抓紧时间，学习毛主席著作。他们热情奔放地说：“我们在这里汗水流得越多，毛泽东思想在这里散发的光辉就越大。”许多桑给巴尔朋友对此深受感动，热烈赞扬说：“从你们身上看到了在毛泽东教导下的中国人民的革命精神”。
    在顺利地完成了最初几口钻井的工作后，出现了新的困难：在坦桑尼亚找不到成井时需要加填的一种砾石。据说，连整个东非，也只有肯尼亚首都内罗毕的一家英国钻井公司有这种材料。在这种情况下，中国水源勘探队牢记毛主席关于“自力更生”、“艰苦奋斗”的教导，决不向殖民主义者伸手。他们同桑给巴尔工程部门商量，决定依靠自己的力量，设法就地取材。他们寻遍全岛，终于在桑给巴尔市郊的海滩上发现了一种类似的砾石可以代用。但是，这种砾石渗合在海沙里，必须把大量沙石从海里捞起，才能筛出来。这就需要付出巨大的劳动。怎么办？按照毛主席的教导，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”当时，桑给巴尔正是最炎热的季节，火辣辣的太阳晒得背上脱了皮，生了疮，咸涩的海水渍得使人难忍。他们在毛主席教导的鼓舞下坚持战斗，先后捞取了几十吨砾石，保证了工程的需要。同中国专家一道工作的桑给巴尔学员深为中国专家这种吃大苦耐大劳的革命精神所感动。他们赞扬说：“你们真不愧是毛主席派来的专家。”“你们是鼓舞我们艰苦工作的榜样。”
    在桑给巴尔岛南部的穆尤尼村，几千居民多少年来一直盼望着能在村里打一口水井，解决用水的困难。中国专家们经过七天七夜的紧张劳动，水是钻出来了，但是一尝，是咸水！村里农民大失所望。中国专家的心情也很不平静，他们重温毛主席《为人民服务》的文章，用“彻底地为人民的利益工作”的精神来要求自己，于是依靠集体智慧，进行艰苦细致的岩层分析，找到了咸水层的位置。他们采用“土”办法成功地堵塞了井下咸水层，杜绝了咸水的渗入。甜美的淡水终于得到了！村里农民喜出望外，奔走相告。他们赞扬中国专家“有技术，有智慧”，
  “把咸水变成淡水，创造了奇迹”。许多农民紧紧拉住中国专家的手，尽情地高呼：“中国，毛泽东，太好了！太感谢了！”
    中国水源勘探队时刻牢记毛主席的教导，努力帮助桑给巴尔人民走自力更生的道路，他们因陋就简结合实际工作，在短期内为桑给巴尔培训了二十五名有一定独立工作能力的水源勘探技术人员，东非从此有了非洲人自己的钻井队伍。坦桑尼亚第一副总统卡鲁姆曾为此号召桑给巴尔学员“不仅要向中国专家学技术，更重要的是学中国专家的优秀品质和良好作风”。
