	Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: The Ministry of National Defense issued an order, conferring the title of "Sea Tiger Boat" on Boat 588 of the Navy.

It has completed its missions excellently, achieved numerous victories, and has been rated as an outstanding boat for four consecutive years. Especially in the naval battle on November 14th of last year, it sank and damaged the Kuomintang escort gunboat "Yongchang" and the large anti-submarine vessel "Yongtai." In this battle, it demonstrated the fighting spirit of our army, which is brave, tenacious, agile, and skilled in close and night combat.

	The order hopes that the crew of Boat 588 will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always emphasize politics, fundamentally strengthen combat readiness, and ensure that the series of policies and directives proposed by the Central Military Commission and the higher authorities are truly implemented. In all situations, they must be able to withstand tests and inspections. Strive for greater victories.
