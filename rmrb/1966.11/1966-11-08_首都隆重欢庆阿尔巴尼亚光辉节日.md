Heroic Albania Becomes a Great Socialist Beacon in Europe

The capital solemnly celebrated Albania's glorious national day. Over a thousand revolutionary masses and Red Guards gathered to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labor Party. Comrades Chen Yi and Liu Ningyi attended.

Chairman Chu Tu-nan and Acting Charge d'Affaires Baba Ni delivered speeches, enthusiastically praising the fighting friendship and cooperation between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania.

New China News Agency, November 7th: Over a thousand revolutionary masses and Red Guards from various circles in the capital solemnly gathered this afternoon to celebrate the glorious national day of the Albanian people—the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labor Party.

The meeting was filled with a strong atmosphere of proletarian internationalist friendship. After the meeting was announced to begin, the entire audience of revolutionaries and Red Guards read aloud the following telegram signed by Chairman Mao, from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party:

	“'Within the sea, there are friends, and at the end of the earth, it is like being neighbors.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those who speak sweetly but have knives in their hearts, nor are we those who play both sides. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests.”

	“Let the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania unite, let all Marxist-Leninists in the world unite, let all revolutionary peoples in the world unite, to overthrow imperialism, to overthrow modern revisionism, to overthrow the reactionaries of all countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without an exploitative system must be established.”

The meeting was held in the Nationalities Cultural Palace. Above the stage hung colorful portraits of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha. Ten red flags stood on either side of the portraits.

Comrade Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Comrade Liu Ningyi, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and others attended the celebration. They, along with Acting Charge d'Affaires Melechi Baba Ni of the Albanian Embassy in China and others, walked onto the stage. The audience waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and, together with the Albanian comrades present, rhythmically chanted "Mao Zedong—Enver" and "Enver—Mao Zedong."

After the "Internationale" was played, Chairman Chu Tu-nan of the China International Friendship Association delivered a warm and friendly speech. He praised the Albanian Labor Party as a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party that has been tested by time. He commended the Albanian people for, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party, shattering the imperialists' and modern revisionists' delusions of encircling, destroying, and strangling Albania, and achieving brilliant successes in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Chu Tu-nan emphasized that the Albanian Labor Party upholds the dictatorship of the proletariat, carries out class struggle, and promotes the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution. In the political, economic, military, and cultural fields, it has taken a series of major revolutionary measures centered on highlighting proletarian politics, further implementing the mass line, and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit. These measures are another brilliant example of the Albanian Labor Party's creative combination of Marxist-Leninist universal truths with the specific practices of their own country, and a new contribution to the enrichment of Marxism-Leninism. The convening of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party will certainly further inspire the Albanian people to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and achieve new victories on all fronts of the great socialist cause.

He said, the Albanian Labor Party has consistently held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, resolutely opposing the aggressive and war policies of imperialism led by the United States, and standing at the forefront of the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership. It has made outstanding contributions to defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, winning the high praise and respect of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples around the world.

Chu Tu-nan, when talking about the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is a new and broader stage in the development of our socialist revolution, a great innovation in the communist movement, and a great innovation in the socialist revolution. The purpose of this great revolution that touches the soul is to eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, transform the soul of the people, achieve the ideological transformation of the people, and uproot the roots of revisionism to consolidate and develop the socialist system. We will turn our country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, so that hundreds of millions of people can grasp Mao Zedong Thought and occupy all ideological positions, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the spiritual face of the entire society. At present, the broad revolutionary masses are thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminating the pernicious influence of this wrong line, correctly implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward.

He said, this unprecedented cultural revolution has been welcomed and supported by revolutionary peoples around the world. This revolution has also caused great fear among imperialists and modern revisionists around the world, who have launched a new anti-China chorus, madly cursing our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. No matter how they curse and attack, the great Chinese people will follow the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and advance the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the peoples of the world!

Chu Tu-nan, when talking about the excellent situation of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world, strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists and the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership for colluding with each other, actively plotting the "peace talks" fraud, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American revolutionary struggle, and achieve the ambition of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. He said, but their wishful thinking is doomed to fail, the wheel of history will smash all the harmful creatures to pieces.

Chu Tu-nan said, the peoples of China and Albania support each other, help each other, and inspire each other, making outstanding contributions to opposing imperialism led by the United States, opposing modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and promoting the world revolutionary cause. Let the peoples of China and Albania, based on Marxism-Leninism, always stand together, fight together, and hold high the revolutionary banner of opposing imperialism and modern revisionism, together with the revolutionary peoples of the world, for the common struggle to overthrow imperialism and modern revisionism!

Acting Charge d'Affaires Melechi Baba Ni was invited to deliver a long speech at the meeting. He reviewed the glorious and heroic deeds of the Albanian Labor Party and the heroic struggle of the Albanian people under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, finally achieving national liberation. He said, the victory of the Albanian people's revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat prove that as long as a country has a revolutionary party armed with Marxist-Leninist thought to lead it, this party can unite the people of all classes in cities and countryside around it, and build a people's army, then no matter how powerful the domestic and foreign enemies are, the people of this country will definitely be able to defeat them.

The Acting Charge d'Affaires also introduced the brave struggle of the Albanian people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, resolutely opposing imperialism, Yugoslav revisionism, and especially Soviet revisionism. He emphasized that the people of our country, united around the Marxist-Leninist party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, unswervingly hold high the banner of victory of Marxism-Leninism, relying on self-reliance and the great, selfless internationalist aid from the brotherly Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, breaking through all the blockades of imperialism and revisionism, smashing their plots, and advancing unitedly on the glorious revolutionary path. Now Albania has become an indestructible socialist fortress on the Adriatic coast.

Acting Charge d'Affaires Baba Ni said, the Albanian Labor Party has also achieved great successes in its foreign policy. Our party has always fought to maintain the independence and freedom of the peoples of all countries and to eliminate the old and new colonial systems, adhering to a policy of resolute opposition to imperialism led by the United States and its lackey, the Khrushchev revisionists. Albania firmly supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people and resolutely exposes the imperialist and revisionist plot of "peace talks."

Acting Charge d'Affaires Baba Ni enthusiastically praised, saying, the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China are invincible giants, an impregnable fortress that the enemies of all peoples—the imperialists and revisionists—cannot destroy, a steadfast banner-bearer for the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries, and a reliable warrior and victor in defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism. He said, the Albanian Labor Party has always believed that the internationalist duty of all Marxist-Leninist parties and all revolutionaries in the world is to defend and support the People's Republic of China and oppose the attacks and slanders of the enemies of mankind—imperialism and revisionism—against China. Today, supporting or opposing the People's Republic of China is the dividing line between true communists and revolutionary leftists and opportunist parties and pseudo-revolutionaries. Taking a two-faced attitude towards the People's Republic of China is taking a two-faced attitude towards the revolutionary and socialist cause.

Acting Charge d'Affaires Baba Ni pointed out that the unity and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries of Albania and China are not only important factors for the victorious socialist construction of the two countries but also important factors for strengthening the communist movement and the revolutionary movement in the world. There is an unbreakable friendship between our two peoples, and we are determined to protect this friendship like the apple of our eye.

Baba Ni said, we are extremely happy about the latest victory of the successful missile and nuclear weapon tests by the brotherly Chinese people. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is another, more powerful nuclear bomb against the enemies of the Chinese people. Mao Zedong Thought has grasped the hearts of all the Chinese people and will certainly become a great force for transforming Chinese society and advancing the Chinese people. The Albanian people wish our most intimate and most respected friend—Chairman Mao Zedong—a long life.

Their speeches full of revolutionary friendship aroused wave after wave of thunderous applause from the entire audience.

Today's meeting was jointly organized by the State Council's Foreign Affairs Committee, the China International Friendship Association, and the China-Albania Friendship Association. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guan-hua, Vice Chairman of the State Council's Foreign Affairs Committee Song Yi-ping, and other relevant officials also attended the meeting. After the meeting, an Albanian documentary film "Socialist Albania Advances" was screened.

    新华社七日讯　首都各界革命群众和红卫兵一千多人今天下午隆重集会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民的光辉节日——阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立二十五周年。
    大会上充满了无产阶级国际主义友谊的强烈气氛。宣布大会开始后，全场革命群众和红卫兵齐声朗读毛主席签署的中国共产党中央委员会致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会贺电的如下电文：
      “‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”
    “中阿两党、两国人民团结起来，全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”
    大会在民族文化宫礼堂举行。主席台正中高悬毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志的彩色画像。画像两旁竖立着十面红旗。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅，中共中央书记处书记、人大常委会副委员长刘宁一等，出席了庆祝大会，他们同阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办梅莱契·巴巴尼等，走上大会主席台时，人们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，同在场的阿尔巴尼亚同志一起，有节奏地欢呼“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”。
    在演奏《国际歌》以后，对外友协会长楚图南发表了热情友好的讲话。他赞颂阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是一个久经考验的革命的马克思列宁主义的党，赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义封锁、破坏和企图扼杀阿尔巴尼亚的痴心妄想，在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。
    楚图南强调说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚持无产阶级专政、开展阶级斗争、发扬不断革命和彻底革命的精神，在政治、经济、军事、文化等领域内，采取了以突出无产阶级政治、进一步贯彻群众路线和发扬革命精神为中心内容的一系列重大革命措施。这些措施，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党创造性地把马克思列宁主义普遍真理同本国具体实践相结合的又一个光辉的范例，是对丰富马克思列宁主义所作出的新贡献。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的召开，必将使阿尔巴尼亚人民进一步发扬不断革命的精神，在伟大的社会主义事业各个战线上取得新的胜利。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚持不渝地高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的革命旗帜，一贯反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，一贯站在反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义斗争的前列，为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为支援各国人民的革命斗争，作出了卓越的贡献，赢得了全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的高度赞扬和尊敬。
    楚图南在谈到我国正在深入发展的无产阶级文化大革命的时候说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是我国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段，是共产主义运动的伟大创举，是社会主义革命的伟大创举。这场触及人们灵魂的大革命，目的就是要消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义的根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度。要把我们的国家变成毛泽东思想的大学校，让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想改造整个社会的精神面貌。目前，广大革命群众正在彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除这条错误路线的恶劣影响，正确贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进。
    他说，这场史无前例的文化大革命引起全世界革命人民的欢呼和支持。这场大革命也引起全世界帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的恐惧，他们发动新的反华大合唱，疯狂地咒骂我们的无产阶级文化大革命。不管敌人怎样咒骂和攻击，伟大的中国人民都将沿着毛泽东同志所指引的道路，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把国际无产阶级和世界人民的革命事业推向前进！
    楚图南谈到全世界革命人民反帝反修的大好形势时，他强烈谴责美帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的修正主义者，狼狈为奸，加紧勾结，积极策划“和谈”骗局，企图扑灭越南人民反美的革命斗争的烈火，以达到美苏合作主宰世界的野心。他说，但是，他们的如意算盘是注定要破产的，历史的巨轮要把一切害人虫砸得粉碎。
    楚图南说，中阿两国人民相互支持，相互帮助，相互鼓舞，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义，反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，促进世界革命事业，作出了卓越的贡献。让中阿两国人民在马克思列宁主义的基础上，永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，更高地举起反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的革命大旗，同全世界革命人民一道，为打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义而共同奋斗！
    梅莱契·巴巴尼临时代办应邀在大会上发表了长篇讲话。他回顾了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的光荣战斗的伟大业绩，以及阿尔巴尼亚人民在恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，同国内外敌人展开英勇顽强的斗争，终于取得民族解放的光荣战斗的历史。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民革命的胜利和无产阶级专政的建立证明：一个国家的人民，尽管她的人口再少，只要她有以马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的革命政党的领导，这个党能够把城乡各阶层人民团结在自己的周围，建立一支工农的军队，那么不管国内外敌人是多么地强大，这个国家的人民就一定可以战胜它们。
    临时代办还介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，勇敢地进行反对帝国主义、南斯拉夫修正主义特别是苏联修正主义者的胜利斗争。他强调说，我国人民团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的马克思列宁主义党的周围，不屈不挠地高举马克思列宁主义的胜利旗帜，依靠自力更生，依靠兄弟的中国人民和毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党给予的巨大的、无私的国际主义援助，冲破了帝国主义和修正主义的一切封锁，粉碎了他们的阴谋，团结一致地向着光荣的革命道路迈进。现在阿尔巴尼亚已成为亚得里亚海岸上一个不可摧毁的社会主义堡垒。
    巴巴尼临时代办说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在对外政策方面也取得了重大的成就。我们党一贯为维护各国人民的独立自由、消灭新老殖民主义制度而斗争，奉行坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和它的仆从赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的政策。阿尔巴尼亚坚决支持越南人民的斗争，并且坚决揭露帝国主义和修正主义策划“和谈”的阴谋活动。
    巴巴尼临时代办热情地赞扬说，中国共产党和中华人民共和国是不可战胜的强大巨人，是全世界人民的敌人——帝国主义和修正主义所不可摧毁的堡垒，是维护各国人民自由、独立的坚定的旗手，是捍卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性的可靠的战士和胜利者。他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党一贯认为，所有马克思列宁主义的党和世界上一切革命者的国际主义义务，是保卫和支持中华人民共和国，反对人类的敌人——帝国主义和修正主义对中国的攻击和诬蔑。今天，支持或反对中华人民共和国是真正的共产党和革命左派同机会主义的党和假革命的分水岭。对中华人民共和国采取两面派态度，就是对革命和社会主义事业采取两面派态度。
    巴巴尼临时代办指出，阿中两党、两国的团结和合作的关系，不仅是阿中两国胜利建设社会主义的重要因素，也是加强世界共产主义运动和革命运动的重要因素。我们两国人民之间有着牢不可破的友谊，我们决心像保护眼珠一样保护这种友谊。
    巴巴尼说，我们为兄弟的中国人民成功地进行导弹核武器试验所取得的最新胜利感到万分高兴。中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命是对中国人民的敌人的另一颗更为强大的核炸弹。毛泽东思想掌握了全中国人民，必将成为改造中国社会和使中国人民阔步前进的巨大力量。阿尔巴尼亚人民祝愿自己最最亲密、最最敬爱的朋友——毛泽东主席万寿无疆。
    他们的充满革命友情的讲话，在全场激起了一阵又一阵雷鸣般的热烈掌声。
    今天的大会是由对外文委、对外友协、中阿友协联合举办的。外交部副部长乔冠华，对外文委副主任宋一平，以及其他有关方面的负责人也出席了大会。大会之后放映了阿尔巴尼亚纪录片《社会主义阿尔巴尼亚在前进》。
