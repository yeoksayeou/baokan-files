Liaoning Province's rural cadres and commune members are vigorously carrying out mass agricultural land construction activities while completing the autumn harvest. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

At present, about one million commune members across the province are participating in agricultural land construction. In many mountainous areas, on the fields, and by the river embankments, red flags are flying, and songs are echoing everywhere, creating a lively and bustling scene. Since autumn, in the regions of Fuxin, Chaoyang, and Liaonan alone, over 720,000 mu of sloping land and terraced fields have been repaired, and more than 700,000 mu of barren hills and waterlogged areas have been treated. In addition, a large number of fish-scale pits and irrigation ditches have been constructed.

    辽宁积极进行农田基本建设
    辽宁省农村广大干部和社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在进行秋收扫尾的同时，积极开展群众性的农田基本建设活动。
    目前，全省参加农田基本建设的社员有一百万人左右，许多山区的工地上，田野里，河堤旁，红旗招展，歌声四起，到处是一派热气腾腾的景象。入秋以来，仅阜新、朝阳、辽南三个地区，就整修坡地、梯田七十二万多亩，治理荒山、涝洼地七十多万亩。此外还修了大量的鱼鳞坑和谷坊。
