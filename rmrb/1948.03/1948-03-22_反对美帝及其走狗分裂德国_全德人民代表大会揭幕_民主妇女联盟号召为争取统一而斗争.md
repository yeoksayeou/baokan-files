    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Berlin Dispatch: The Second All-German People's Congress for the reunification of Germany and a just peace solemnly opened here on the 17th. Two thousand representatives from major parties, democratic groups, and various classes from all over the country attended. They, representing the German people, loudly protested against the attempt by US imperialism and its lackeys to split Germany. Hundreds of them were from the Western occupied zones, the vast majority of whom, under the persecution and intimidation of the US, British, and French occupying authorities, crossed the border illegally with the greatest enthusiasm and courage to attend. Nuschke, Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, delivered the opening speech, saying that the military treaty of the five Western European countries under the protection of the United States is used to finally split Europe. This divisive line will tear Germany apart and turn West Germany into an appendage of the Western European political and military bloc. Nuschke emphatically stated that the German People's Congress, as the unified representative body of the entire German people, strongly protests against the division of Germany. The German people demand the right to express their will to strive for German reunification through a national referendum. Grotewohl, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, then reported on the lessons of the March Revolution of 1848 and the struggle of the German people for national reunification. The whole audience burst into thunderous applause. Kurz, a leader of the Free Democratic Party and member of the presidium, also gave a report to the congress.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Berlin Dispatch: As the prestige of the People's Congress increases among the German people, the Standing Committee of the German People's Congress has been expanded and renamed the People's Council. The council is scheduled to hold the Second People's Congress on the 17th and 18th. The Central Bureau of the Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee in the Soviet occupation zone recently sent congratulations on behalf of 500,000 farmers, stating that German farmers believe that the establishment of the People's Council is the German working people's response to the irresponsible actions of the proponents of the Frankfurt initiative. German farmers demand that the Second People's Congress find ways to prevent the final division of Germany. The movement of the People's Congress has become a watchword of national significance. Among the local People's Congresses that have been held recently, the People's Congress in Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost state in the British occupation zone, deserves mention. It was established in Landsberg (west of Kiel) despite the ban of the British occupation authorities, with the participation of many parties and democratic groups.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Berlin Dispatch: The German Democratic Women's League held a meeting of its members on the 11th, attended by representatives from 20 branches of the League in Berlin. To convene this meeting, 200 women's gatherings were held in previous weeks, attended by more than 30,000 women. The League now has 150 branches with a total of 10,000 members. Speakers at the meeting unanimously urged the formation of a unified and democratic Germany and called on German women to fight to achieve this goal. The meeting adopted the League's program. General Kotikov, the Soviet military commander in Berlin, said when receiving the newly elected central bureau and local bureau chairpersons of the League: The formation of the Berlin Democratic Women's League comes at a time of intense struggle between the forces of division betraying the German people and the forces supporting German reunification. Kotikov said: In this struggle, the Soviet military government will always support the democratic forces, including the democratic forces of women.

    【新华社陕北二十日电】柏林讯：争取德国统一及正义和平的第二届德国人民代表大会，于十七日在此间庄严举行。到有全国各地的各主要党派、民主团体及各阶级的代表二千人。他们代表全德人民大声疾呼，抗议美帝及其奴才分裂德国的企图。其中数百名来自西占区，其中绝大多数都是在美、英、法占领当局的迫害及恫吓下，抱着最大的热情及勇气，非法越过边界与会的。基督教民主联盟主席努舍克致开幕辞说：美国保护下的西欧五国军事条约，是用来最后分裂欧洲的。这个分裂路线将使整个德国支离破碎，使西德变成西欧政治军事集团的附庸。努氏力称：德国人民代表大会作为全德人民的统一的代表机关，强烈抗议分裂德国。德国人民要求有权通过全民投票的方式，表示他们争取德国统一的意志。统一社会党主席格罗提渥继报告一八四八年三月革命的教训及德国人民争取国家统一的斗争情形。全场掌声雷动。主席团之一的自由民主党领袖库尔兹亦向大会作报告。
