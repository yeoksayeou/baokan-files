　　[Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 1st dispatch] On the night of February 21st, local armed forces in Eastern Hebei raided Yangcun, an important town on the Beining Railway line, 60 miles northwest of Tianjin. After five hours of fierce fighting, the majority of the defending enemy were wiped out, with over 150 enemy soldiers killed or wounded and 300 captured. On the same day, another unit of our troops encircled and annihilated the intruding Chiang Kai-shek bandit puppet "Tongxian 9th District Team" and three puppet "Big Township" local bandits in the Yongledian area, 50 miles southeast of Tongxian. The captured included Deputy Battalion Commander Wang Shuping and 82 others, with 15 killed or wounded. In the two battles mentioned above, a total of two 60mm mortars, five small cannons, twenty-one light machine guns, two hundred and eighty-eight rifles and pistols, over 23,000 rounds of ammunition, and other materials were seized.

(2) One mountain gun, two mortars, sixteen 60mm mortars, one hundred and twenty-seven light and heavy machine guns, ninety-two submachine guns, twenty-four automatic rifles, one thousand two hundred and seven rifles and carbines, six hundred and seventy-four shells, one hundred and nineteen thousand two hundred and seventy rounds of ammunition, and a portion of other military supplies were seized. (3) Fifty-five miles of railway were destroyed, eighteen railway bridges were blown up, and one armored train and one locomotive were destroyed.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th dispatch] According to a Tianjin newspaper report on January 26th: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities, in their twilight years, are accepting the mantle of the Japanese寇's enslavement rule in China, implementing a "village consolidation policy," forcibly "merging scattered small villages into large villages," attempting to further control the people's righteous resistance, and to facilitate extracting money, grain, and lives from the people. This fascist method has been decided to be implemented in the Chiang-occupied areas of Eastern Hebei counties, and will subsequently be "promoted in North China (various Chiang-occupied areas)."
