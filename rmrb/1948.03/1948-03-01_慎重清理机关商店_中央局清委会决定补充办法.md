　　【This Newspaper News】The Central Bureau Clearing Committee, according to several resolutions of the second meeting, issued a notice to the district party committees and clearing committees, the contents of which are as follows:
    A. According to recent understanding of the situation, agency stores in our area account for a considerable proportion of commerce in certain cities and market towns. If too many are closed, it will affect the prosperity of the market. Therefore, the following supplementary measures are made:
    1. All agency and military unit-run stores must continue to be cleaned up and settled in accordance with the Central Bureau's decision on cleaning up agency production. However, a cautious attitude should be taken towards declaring a cessation of business. Stores that are beneficial to the people, have a significant impact on the market, and are well-managed should generally adopt the principle of continuing operations and transferring management. Conversely, they should resolutely implement a deadline for closure and no longer be retained, so as to avoid sitting idly by and depleting resources.
    2. In order to thoroughly clean up agency stores, in addition to the clearing committees at all levels being responsible for the cleanup, urban and market town clearing committees must also be organized on the basis of cities and market towns (referring to larger cities and market towns) to be responsible for the agency production cleanup (mainly stores) in the city or market town. The clearing committee shall be composed of responsible comrades from the local Party committee, government, industry and commerce bureau (or trade company), and relatively good agency stores. It must also be led by the city's superior clearing committee (such as Linqing being led by the Jinnan District Clearing Committee, and Yangyi being led by the Wu'an Clearing Committee). In addition to being responsible for the cleanup, its powers also include the right to decide whether to retain or close the stores in the area.
    3. If cooperatives or private individuals are unwilling to take over stores that are decided to be retained or transferred, the local industry and commerce bureau or trade company must be responsible for taking over. However, the following five points must be noted: (1) The funds must be set up separately and cannot be mixed with the funds of the industry and commerce bureau or trade company. (2) It can only become the leading part of the local industry and commerce bureau or trade company, not a component part. (3) Its leadership direction should be handled according to general mass stores, and cannot be treated the same as state-owned stores. (4) After the cleanup and settlement, four copies of the settlement transfer form must be prepared and sent to the relevant departments (the agency to which the store belongs, the receiving agency or company, the local clearing committee, and the clearing committee of the agency to which the store belongs). (5) The industry and commerce bureau or trade company responsible for the takeover must estimate the value of the property of the store it receives (referring to those belonging to the border finance system) and report it to the Border Government Finance and Trade Bureaus for record.
    4. In order to prosper the urban economy and prevent price fluctuations, stores that have not been explicitly declared closed by clearing committees at all levels must continue to operate and must not be stopped. However, in the process of operation, all preparations for transfer and settlement must be made.
    B. Supplementary regulations on agency production handicrafts, workshops, and transportation:
    1. Flour mills and tofu workshops run by agency units, in addition to providing food for the agency units themselves, may directly sell any surplus to the market without going through cooperatives.
    2. Agency units may engage in transportation on foot within their own established staffing quota and without hiring workers, but they are not allowed to engage in private trafficking activities under the guise of transportation.
    3. Farriers within the established staffing quota of the artillery and cavalry units may set up stalls to conduct business and charge fees in their spare time.

　　慎重清理机关商店
  　中央局清委会决定补充办法
    【本报消息】中央局清委会，根据第二次会议几项决议，向各区党委、清委会发出通知，内容如下：
    甲、根据最近情况了解，我区机关商店在某些城市、集镇的商业中，占的比重相当大，如结束的过多，会影响市面繁荣，为此特作如下补充：
    一、一切机关部队之经营商店，均须按照中央局清理机关生产决定继续进行清理结算。但对宣告停止营业，应持慎重态度。凡对人民有益，对市场影响较大，经营较好的商店，一般应采取继续经营转移管理的方针。反之，应坚决实行限期结束，不再保留，以免坐吃山空。
    二、为了彻底清理机关商店，除由各级清委会负责清理外；并须以城市及集镇为单位（指较大的城市和集镇而言），组织城市和集镇的清委会，负责该城市集镇的机关生产清理（主要是商店）。该清委会由当地党委、政府、工商局（或贸易公司）与比较好的机关商店负责同志组成之。并须受该城市上级清委会领导（如临清应受冀南区清委会领导、阳邑受武安清委会领导），其职权除负责清理外，并有决定该地商店保留或结束之权。
    三、凡决定保留或转移的商店，如合作社或私人不愿接办时，当地工商局或贸易公司须负责接管。但须注意以下五点：（一）其资金须另立科目，不能与工商局贸易公司资金混同。（二）只能成为该地工商局或贸易公司的领导部分，不是组成部分。（三）对其领导方针，应按一般群众商店办理，不能同公营商店一律看待。（四）清理结算后，须将其结算移交表缮制四份，分送各有关部门（该商店所属之机关，接收之机关或公司，当地清委会，该商店所属之机关之清委会）。（五）负责接管之工商局或贸易公司，须所接收商店（指属于边财系统者）财产估价，分报边府财、贸两厅备查。
    四、为了繁荣城市经济，防止物价波动，未经各级清委会的明令宣告结束之商店，均须继续营业，不得停止。但在营业过程中，须作转移结算之一切准备。
    乙、关于机关生产手工业、作坊、运输之补充：
    一、机关单位经营之粉坊、豆腐坊，除供本机关单位吃用外，如有剩余，可直接向市场出售，不再经过合作社。
    二、凡机关单位在自己编制以内及不雇用工人的条件下。可以搅脚从事运输，但不准假借运输之便，私行贩运活动。
    三、部队炮兵骑兵在编制以内之钉掌匠，在业余时间，可设摊进行营业收费。
