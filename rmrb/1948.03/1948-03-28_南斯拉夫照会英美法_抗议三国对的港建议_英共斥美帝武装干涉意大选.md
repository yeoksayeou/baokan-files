　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Belgrade dispatch: Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic delivered a note to the American, British and French ambassadors on the 22nd, expressing "the most resolute protest against the US, Britain and France's proposal to amend the clauses in the Italian Peace Treaty concerning the fate of the Free Territory of Trieste." The note opposed the three countries' claim that this amendment only required Italy's consent, and insisted that the consent of Yugoslavia, one of the Allied countries directly involved, must be obtained. The note pointed out that this proposal has an inflammatory purpose and is not conducive to the cause of world peace and unity. The note condemned "the US, Britain and France for doing their best to obstruct an agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia on the Trieste issue," and for "systematically undermining the Security Council's decision on the appointment of the Governor of Trieste." At the same time, the American and British military administrations in the Free Territory have indulged the fascists and Italian chauvinists in the area as much as possible, depriving the people of various basic democratic rights and freedoms. The American and British occupied areas of the Free Territory are the only places in liberated Europe where elections for autonomous government organs have not yet been held. Therefore, it has hindered the peaceful establishment of the Free Territory and worsened South-Italian relations. The note finally pointed out that the US imperialists' proposal, just before the Italian elections, was intended to provoke the chauvinists' hatred for the Yugoslav people and worsen the domestic political situation in Italy. This is not conducive to the Italian people, nor is it conducive to the peace and unity of this part of Europe.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: London dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 20th, exposing the US imperialists' plot of armed intervention in the Italian elections. The statement emphasized: "Truman's armed fist shows that the target of the current US aggression policy is primarily aimed at the Italian people who are preparing for elections. The US imperialists and reactionaries of various countries fear that the People's Democratic Front will win the upcoming elections," so "a smear campaign has been launched in Italy." The statement continued to denounce the US imperialists for "trying to blatantly interfere in the foreign policy of a major European country through 'stopping aid' to Italy and other shameless means." The British Communist Party's Workers' Daily also protested against the US imperialists' preparation for armed intervention in Italy, and it denounced "the US and Britain's plan to turn Italy into a second Greece. They are unwilling to see the people in power and would rather start a civil war. The US and Britain want to use the crazy slander against the Soviet Union and the creation of war mania to cover up their plan to attack Italian democracy. This is how Hitler and Mussolini attacked democratic Spain."

　　南斯拉夫照会英美法
  　抗议三国对的港建议
    英共斥美帝武装干涉意大选
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫外长西米区，在二十二日递交美英法大使照会一件，对“美英法提出修改对意和约中有关的里雅斯特自由区命运的条款，表示最坚决的抗议。”照会反对三国所说这一修改只需要意大利的同意，而力主必须取得与之直接有关的同盟国之一南斯拉夫的同意。照会指出这一提议具有煽动性的目的，无益于世界和平团结的事业。照会斥责“美英法尽力阻挠意、南之间对的港问题获致协议，”并“有系统地破坏了安理会对任命的港总督的决定”。同时该自由区美英军事管理当局尽量放纵该区法西斯和意大利沙文主义分子，剥夺了的人民的各种基本民主权利及自由。的区的美英占领区，是解放了的欧洲地域中，一直到今天还没有举行自治政府机关选举的绝无仅有的地方。因此，阻碍了的区和平的树立，恶化了南意的关系。照会最后指出：恰在意大选前美帝等提出这一建议，是欲挑拨沙文主义者对南国人民的仇恨，并恶化了意国内政治局势。这既不利于意人民，也不利于欧洲这一部分的和平团结。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】伦敦讯：英共中央执行委员会于二十日发表声明，揭露美帝武装干涉意大选的阴谋。声明着重指出：“杜鲁门的武装拳头，表示目前美国侵略政策的目标，首先针对着正在准备选举的意大利人民，美帝与各国反动派恐惧人民民主阵线在行将到来的选举中获胜，”因此“一个诽谤运动已在意大利发动”。声明继痛斥美帝正由“停止对意‘援助’及其它无耻手段，企图肆无忌惮的干涉这一个欧洲主要国家的外交政策。”英共工人日报亦抗议美帝准备武装干涉意大利，它斥责“美英计划把意国变成第二希腊，他们不愿见人民当权而宁愿动内战。美英想用对苏联的疯狂诋毁与制造战争狂，来掩盖他们进攻意国民主的计划，希特勒与墨索里尼就是这样进攻民主西放牙的。”
