Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, March 15th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army captured the strategic central city of Siping Street on the 13th, completely annihilating the defending enemy, the 88th Division of the 71st Army, a cavalry regiment, three security regiments, the remaining units of the 87th and 91st Divisions of the 71st Army, the cadre training corps of the 91st Division, the puppet Liaobei Provincial Government and its security forces, totaling more than 16,000 people, with no one escaping the net. Our army launched a general offensive at 8:00 am on the 12th. After 23 hours of fierce fighting, this solid strategic fortress, built with modern permanent fortifications, was completely destroyed. The battle was completely resolved at 7:00 am on the 13th. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, March 15th: Wang Jiashan, the former commander of the Provisional 58th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army who revolted in Yingkou, and all the officers and soldiers of the division, have issued a public telegram to the people of the whole country. The original text is as follows: Respectfully to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, Commander Lin Biao, and forwarded to the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang Government, all armies of the Kuomintang, all news agencies, newspapers and compatriots across the country: At 7:00 pm on February 25th, 1948, all officers and soldiers of our Provisional 58th Division have resolutely broken away from the Kuomintang reactionary group at our base in Yingkou and officially joined the People's Liberation Army. We thank all comrades of the People's Liberation Army for their warm welcome. We celebrate this glorious day of uprising and are willing to announce the beginning and end of this uprising to the people of the country.

　　In the past, under the blind concept of orthodoxy, we joined Chiang Kai-shek's army, originally wanting to engage in peaceful reconstruction after the War of Resistance under the leadership of the so-called "Central Government," and to be loyal to the nation and the country. However, the facts of the past two years have completely shattered our illusions. The reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government has no regard for the nation or the country, except for the interests of its four families and its American masters. Since the "August 15th" victory, Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of our national sovereignty has far exceeded that of all traitors since the Republic of China. The people's suffering caused by the civil war manufactured by the US and Chiang Kai-shek is unprecedented. This tyrant, Chiang Kai-shek, is truly "saying all the good things and doing all the bad things." "Two Manchurias" is an appropriate title for the people of the Northeast to describe his reactionary rule.

　　But today, the Kuomintang reactionaries' viciousness precisely demonstrates their dead end and desperate struggle. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army has launched a large-scale offensive against its small court in a corner, like sweeping away dead leaves. From the Northeast to North China, from the Yellow River to the Huai River, the army has been warmly welcomed by the people everywhere with food and drink. Comrades in other Chiang-occupied areas are also eagerly looking forward to it. Today, the two regions of China—the liberated areas and the Chiang-controlled areas—are such obvious contrasts: On the one hand, the solemn and great birth of a new China; on the other hand, the dying of the licentious and shameless old forces.

　　Faced with these incomparably obvious facts, Shan et al. deeply repent of their past service to the Kuomintang reactionaries, which in reality made them accomplices to counter-revolution. Chiang Kai-shek is using our flesh and blood to maintain his status as a US slave. Our righteous act this time is the beginning of serving the Chinese people and is also a declaration of war against the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group that oppresses the people and sells out China. We are determined to fight the Kuomintang reactionaries to the end under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We are willing to learn all the excellent revolutionary traditions of the People's Liberation Army and thoroughly transform ourselves into an army of the people. We resolutely support the Outline Land Law of China and abide by all the laws and decrees of the democratic government to show our sincerity in serving the people.

　　This uprising of our entire division is just a signal. We believe that there are still many people in the sinful Chiang Kai-shek army who have the same ideas as us, and they will also act like us. However, we still hope that this action will be quick and that there will be no more illusions about the US and Chiang Kai-shek. The past is vivid in our minds. Aren't the fates of many Chiang army generals only capture and death? If you are unwilling to follow Chiang Kai-shek into the grave, then please quickly choose the path we have taken—a glorious uprising to join the People's Liberation Army. Do not wait to die, lest you miss the opportunity and regret it too late. With electric urgency, we hope for your consideration.

　　东北我军克四平街歼灭蒋匪一万六千
    【新华社东北十五日电】东北解放军十三日攻克战略中心城市四平街，全部干净歼灭守敌七十一军八十八师和一个骑兵团、三个保安团，七十一军八十七师、九十一师等单位留守处，九十一师干部教导队，伪辽北省府及其保安部队等部共一万六千余人，无一漏网。我军系于十二日上午八时开始总攻，经二十三小时激战，尽毁此一构筑有现代化永久性工事堡垒的强固战略要塞，十三日晨七时全部解决战斗，详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社东北十五日电】在营口起义的前蒋军暂五十八师师长王家善及全师官兵，顷对全国军民发表通电，原文如下：毛主席、朱彭总副司令、林彪司令员并转全国人民解放军、国民党政府、国民党一切军队、全国通讯社、各报馆暨全国同胞公鉴：在民国三十七年二月二十五日午后七时，我们暂五十八师全体官兵已于营口驻地决然脱离国民党反动集团的关系，正式参加人民解放军。我们感谢人民解放军全体同志对我们的热烈欢迎，我们庆祝这个光荣起义的日子，并愿将此次起义的始末，昭告国人。
    过去我们是在盲目的正统观念下投入蒋家军队的，原想在所谓“中央”的领导下，从事抗战后和平建设，效忠国家民族。可是两年来的事实已完全粉碎了我们的幻想，反动的蒋家朝廷除了其四大家族及其美国主子的利益外，根本就无所谓民族国家。“八一五”胜利以来，蒋介石出卖我国家之主权，已远远超过民国以来的一切卖国贼。在美蒋制造的内战爆发后，其所造成的人民灾难，为空前所未有，蒋介石这个暴君正是“好话说尽，坏事作绝”，“二满洲”正是东北人民对它的反动统治恰如其分的称号。
    但今天国民党反动派的穷凶极恶，也正是说明了他们穷途末路与其绝望的挣扎，而在中国共产党领导下，人民解放军已大举向其偏安一隅的小朝廷进攻，有如摧枯拉朽，从东北到华北，从黄河到江淮，大军所至，各地人民箪食壶浆热烈欢迎。其他蒋占区的同胞也正引领瞻望。今天中国的两个区域——解放区和蒋管区正是多么明显的对照：一方面是庄严伟大的新中国的诞生，另方面是荒淫无耻旧势力的垂亡。
    面对着这无比明显的事实，善等深自忏悔过去效命于国民党反动派，实际是作了反革命的帮凶，蒋介石正是利用我们的血肉之躯，来维持其美国奴才的地位。我们这次的义举，是为中国人民服务的开始，也是和压迫人民出卖中国的蒋介石反动集团宣战。我们要坚决的在中国共产党领导下，誓与国民党反动派斗争到底。我们愿意学习解放军的一切优良革命传统，彻底改造为人民的军队。我们坚决拥护中国土地法大纲，遵守民主政府的一切法令，以表示我们效忠人民的真诚。
    此次我们全师起义只是一个信号，我们相信在罪恶的蒋家队伍中，还有不少人存在着象我们一样的想法，他们也将会象我们一样的行动起来。不过我们还希望这种行动要快，不要再对美蒋存有任何幻想。往事历历在目，许多蒋军将校的命运还不是只有被俘和死亡两途，如果你们不愿跟蒋介石钻到坟墓里去，那么就请你们很快选择我们所走的道路——光荣起义参加人民解放军，万勿束手待毙，致贻误良机，后悔莫及，临电振奋，敬希公鉴。
