　　【Taihang News】District cadre Wang Dongxian from Yushe Second District and district cadre Li Linyun from Xiangyuan Second District, after studying and reflecting on their mistakes, resolutely returned the fruits they had seized and encroached upon from the masses and sincerely accepted the criticism of the masses in order to further reform themselves. When Wang Dongxian worked in Xiakou in the second district of the county, he believed that he was the leader and controlled everything. He secretly hid 29 pieces of clothing and items seized as fruits of struggle. Recently, after returning from the reorganization and study by the Second Prefectural Committee, he deeply felt that his theft and occupation of the fruits of the masses directly harmed the interests of the masses in their liberation. Therefore, he personally carried the seized fruits to Xiakou to admit his mistakes and return them to the masses. At the village peasant meeting, Comrade Dongxian said: "My past thinking was to enjoy prosperity and love wealth. Relying on my position as a cadre, I stole the fruits of everyone's struggle. Today, I want to return them all. Besides the three pieces I have worn out, I will compensate 10,000 yuan. The remaining 26 pieces are all here. Another mistake is that my class stand was not clear. During the distribution of fruits, whoever spoke actively and dared to fight the landlord would get more. I didn't consider the liberation of us poor people at all." Then, the peasants boldly put forward many suggestions to him. Wang Laoxiao said: "That year when you led the liberation in our village, you insisted that my family had buried things belonging to the struggle object and mobilized the masses to struggle until midnight, hanging my parents and reviving them with water, but in the end, nothing was found. All the clothes in my house were taken away. Later, after discussion and investigation by the masses, they were returned to me. At that time, my father, rather than see his family suffer, repeatedly pleaded with you. But you didn't distinguish between right and wrong. What kind of things were you doing!?" The masses also put forward: "Why didn't you fight the landlord at that time, but instead targeted military dependents (referring to Wang Laoxiao's family)? It was really wrong." Comrade Wang Dongxian sincerely accepted each point and said with shame: "I didn't get close to the masses at that time, couldn't see the class clearly, and just listened to one side, and did things blindly like that. This is my big mistake, I fully accept it and will resolutely correct it in the future." Comrade Li Linyun, who came from a middle peasant background, led the masses in Yangze River in the first district of the county in their liberation the year before last. During the distribution of fruits, the village "supported" him with a leather jacket and a mattress. After the promulgation of the Land Law this time, he realized that it was right to be a farmhand for the masses and actively lead them, but he should not have received the "supported" fruits. He personally went to Yangze River on February 2nd to return them, and said: "This is harming the interests of the poor peasants and farmhands in their liberation." After the return, the masses happily said: "If all the cadres handle affairs according to the Land Law like this comrade, we will be able to completely liberate ourselves!"

　　区干王洞先李林云退还侵占果实
  　诚恳接受群众批评
    【太行消息】榆社二区区干部王洞先、襄垣二区区干部李林云，在经过学习反省自己错误后，坚决将抓取和侵占的群众果实退还，并诚恳接受群众批评，以进一步的改造自己。王洞先在该县二区峡口工作时，他认为自己是领导人，一切由他掌握，曾暗藏偷拿果实衣物二十九件。最近由二地委整编学习返回后，深感自己偷占果实是直接妨害群众翻身利益的，便亲自背上侵占果实到峡口向群众认错退还。在村农民大会上，洞先同志说：“我过去的思想是享荣华爱富贵，仗凭干部偷拿大家斗争果实，今天我要全部退还；除了我已经穿坏三件赔偿一万块钱外，其余二十六件都拿来啦。再一个错误是我阶级立场不明，分果实时是谁发言积极、敢打地主，谁就分得多；根本没为咱穷人翻身谋了利。”接着，农民大胆给他提出了不少爱护意见，王老小说：“你那年在俺村领导翻身，硬说俺家埋藏斗争对象东西，发动群众斗争半夜，把俺父母吊死喷活，最后也没找出来，把俺家所有衣物都拿去。后来经群众讨论、调查，才又给俺补出来。那时俺父亲宁舍万贯家产，不愿骨肉吃苦，向你再三恳求。可你就没分清是非，看你办的啥事情！？”群众也纷纷提出：“为啥那时不斗地主，要搞军属（指王老小家），真是不对。”王洞先同志一一诚恳接受，并惭愧的说：“我那时没接近群众，看不清阶级，只片面听了一句话，就那样瞎干。这是我的大错误，完全接受，今后坚决改正。”中农出身的李林云同志，前年在该县一区阳泽河领导群众翻身，分果实时村上“拥护”了他小皮袄、褥子各一件。这次土地法公布后，他认识了给群众当长工，积极领导是应该的，不该得“拥护”果实。特在二月二日，也亲自到阳泽河退还，并说：“我这是损害贫雇翻身利益的。”退还后，群众高兴的说：“干部要都象这个同志照土地法办事，咱还能翻不透身！”
