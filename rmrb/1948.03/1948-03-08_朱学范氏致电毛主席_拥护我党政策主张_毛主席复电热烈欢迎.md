Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Chinese Labour Association, and Liu Ningyi, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the Liberated Areas, returned from Europe and arrived in Harbin on February 28th. On the 29th, Zhu Xuefan sent a telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, stating:

"Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhou:

Xuefan and Brother Ningyi have arrived in Harbin. In Paris, I saw Chairman Mao's report on 'The Present Situation and Our Tasks.' I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support this brilliant proposition to thoroughly smash the Chiang regime, expel American imperialism, implement land reform, organize a truly people's democratic united government, and complete the revolutionary cause of independence, democracy, and peace. Therefore, I am determined to go to the Liberated Areas and participate in this historical struggle. I deeply know that this action is not only my personal issue, but I also believe that there are many true followers of Sun Yat-sen and a large number of patriotic people who will move in this direction, fight side by side, and fight to the end under your leadership to achieve final victory. I hereby extend my revolutionary greetings to you. Zhu Xuefan, February 29th, 37th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1948]".

After receiving the telegram, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhou replied as follows:

"Mr. Zhu Xuefan:

We received your telegram of the 29th and are delighted to learn that you have arrived in Harbin and are determined to cooperate with the Communist Party of China to fight for the great common cause of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. We express a warm welcome to this action of yours and the similar actions of other true followers of Sun Yat-sen. With revolutionary greetings to the Chinese people's democratic revolution. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, March 4th".

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Chinese Labour Association, who attended the World Federation of Trade Unions, and Liu Ningyi, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the Liberated Areas, arrived in Harbin from Paris on the 28th of last month and were warmly welcomed by representatives from the Northeast Liberated Areas and the Harbin General Labour Union. The Northeast Administrative Committee and the Preparatory Office of the Northeast General Labour Union hosted a banquet on the evening of the 29th to welcome Mr. Zhu Xuefan and Comrade Liu Ningyi. In his speech, Mr. Zhu stated: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the workers in the Liberated Areas have attained a free and happy life. The workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are still suffering from cruel oppression, massacres, unemployment, and starvation, living a hellish life. Therefore, all Chinese workers should unite, unite with the people of the whole country under the leadership of Chairman Mao, thoroughly smash the Chiang regime, expel American imperialism from China, implement land reform, eliminate feudal forces, and strive to establish an independent, democratic, and peaceful New Democratic China."

Note: The Chinese Labour Association, led by Mr. Zhu, was established in 1935 and includes more than 90 units, with a membership of 2,175,177 (including members of various trade unions in the Chinese Liberated Areas who have joined the Labour Association). The Association has been engaged in worker welfare work over the years. Because it refused to accept the manipulation of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, it has been repeatedly persecuted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. In November of the previous year, Mr. Zhu refused to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's puppet National Assembly, fled to Hong Kong, and issued a statement denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-National Assembly and the reactionary measures that destroyed the Labour Association. He was wounded in an assassination attempt by Chiang's agents on the 25th. In June of last year, Mr. Zhu and Comrade Liu Ningyi went to Prague to attend the First Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council. In November, they attended the Executive Bureau meeting of the Paris Trade Union. Before returning to China, Mr. Zhu and Comrade Liu Ningyi jointly signed a proposal to the World Federation of Trade Unions opposing the Marshall Plan to enslave Europe and the Wedemeyer Plan to aid Chiang and invade China, calling on workers all over the world to unite against American fascist aggression policy.

　　朱学范氏致电毛主席
  　拥护我党政策主张
  　毛主席复电热烈欢迎
    【新华社陕北六日电】中国劳动协会理事长朱学范，与中国解放区总工会筹备委员会主任刘宁一，同由欧洲返国，于二月二十八日抵达哈尔滨。朱学范氏于二十九日致电中共中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，和中共中央革命军事委员会副主席周恩来同志称：
    “毛主席、周副主席鉴：
    学范已和宁一兄到了哈尔滨。在巴黎时，看到了毛主席关于‘目前形势和我们的任务’的报告，范完全同意并竭诚拥护这一彻底粉碎蒋政权、驱逐美帝国主义、实行土地改革、组织真正的人民民主的联合政府、完成独立民主和平的革命事业的英明主张，所以范决心到了解放区，参加这一历史的斗争。范深知这一行动，不只是我个人的问题，更相信还有不少的真正孙中山信徒，和广大的爱国人士，都要向着这一方向前进，并肩作战，在你们的领导下斗争到底，获得最后胜利。谨此向你们致革命敬礼。朱学范，三十七年二月二十九日”。
    毛主席和周副主席接电后，复电如下：
    “朱学范先生：
    接二十九日电示，欣悉先生到达哈尔滨，并决心与中国共产党合作，为中国人民民主革命的伟大的共同事业而奋斗，极为佩愉。我们对于先生的这一行动，以及其他真正孙中山信徒的同样的行动，表示热烈的欢迎。此致中国人民民主革命的敬礼。毛泽东、周恩来，三月四日”。
    【新华社东北六日电】出席世界工联之中国劳动协会理事长朱学范，及中国解放区职工联合会筹备会主任刘宁一，于上月二十八日自巴黎抵达哈尔滨，备受东北解放区及哈市总工会代表热烈欢迎。东北行政委员会及东北总工会筹备处，特于二十九日晚为朱学范先生及刘宁一同志设宴洗尘。朱氏即席发表演说略称：“解放区工人们在毛主席领导下，已得到自由幸福的生活。蒋管区工人们则还受着残酷的压榨、屠杀、失业和饥饿的痛苦，过着地狱一般的生活。因此全中国工人们应联合起来，在毛主席领导下和全国人民团结一致，彻底粉碎蒋政权，驱逐美帝国主义出中国，实行土地改革，肃清封建势力，为建立独立、民主、和平的新民主主义的中国而奋斗”。
    按：朱氏所领导之中国劳动协会，成立于一九三五年，包括九十余单位，拥有会员二百一十七万五千一百七十七人，（包括已加入劳协之中国解放区各工会会员）。该会历年从事工人福利工作，因拒绝接受蒋匪特务的操纵，屡遭蒋匪迫害。前年十一月间，朱氏拒绝参加蒋匪猪仔国大出奔香港，发表声明痛斥蒋匪伪国大及摧残劳协反动措施，二十五日被蒋特行刺受伤。去年六月，朱氏及刘宁一同志赴捷京出席世界工联第一届理事大会，十一月复出席巴黎工联执行局会议。返国前朱氏曾与刘宁一同志联合署名，向世界工联提出反对马歇尔奴役欧洲及魏德迈援蒋侵华计划之提案，号召全世界工人团结起来反对美国法西斯侵略政策。
