　　Bad Cadres Run Wild
　　Poor and Hired Peasants Dare Not Speak Out
　　Preliminary Understanding of the Situation by the Miao Xiaotun Work Team
    [Yongnian News] After the Miao Xiaotun Work Team of the Fourth District of Yongnian arrived in the village, they went deep into the homes of the poor and hired peasants to understand the situation in the village. However, the poor peasants did not dare to talk to us directly. After several days of investigation, the main reason was fear of the cadres, fear of the district cadres and fear of the village cadres. Last year, the masses opposed the militia captain Miao Lin's (nickname "Second Yama") corruption, and the masses were settling accounts with him for his corruption. At this time, Li Po (town head of Linluoguan), of the district, heard that there was no cadre leadership, and the masses had risen up on their own. This was intolerable. He immediately sent several militiamen to Miao Xiaotun to bring several poor peasants. Without explanation, he ordered the militiamen to beat them. Wang Shengcai, an honest and poor peasant, asked to reason when he was being tied up, but he was not allowed to speak. Later, Miao Lin and several poor peasants who were tied up were brought to the Linluoguan Public Security Bureau. Miao Lin was questioned and then released. When Miao returned to the street, he suppressed the masses again. He said: "The Public Security Bureau and Town Head Li told me to come back to investigate." The masses were so frightened that no one dared to say a word on the street. This time, after several mobilizations and explaining to the poor peasants the mistakes of the past cadres, it was decided that we must work with the masses from now on. Only then did the poor peasants dare to boldly reflect their opinions, talking about the main errors of the militia captain Miao Lin in the past, such as corruption, messing with women, and suppressing the masses, as follows: (1) At the beginning of the movement last year, he led the militia to five landlord and rich peasant families and borrowed a total of 320,000 yuan in private loans. (2) He forcibly sought after Old Duan's younger sister. Old Duan disagreed and had an ugly argument with him. Miao used the excuse to label Old Duan with a "hat" and ordered the militia to bring Old Duan to the team headquarters, tie him to a bench, and interrogate him about acts of sabotage. When he did not confess, they applied a lever torture. (3) He privately levied funds. The first time, using the excuse of digging war preparedness cellars (because the enemy was still in Yongding City at that time), he levied more than 2,000 jin of rice, saying it was for the masses to eat, but he embezzled it himself. The second time, he levied 100 yuan per mu, totaling more than 100,000 yuan, and embezzled more than 70,000 yuan. (4) For conscription, he levied 150 yuan per mu, totaling 240,000 yuan, giving 50,000 yuan to the new soldiers. The remaining 190,000 yuan was said to be used to buy bullets, but in fact, he did not buy any, and embezzled it all. In total, in more than a year, he embezzled and privately borrowed about 650,000 yuan from landlords, more than 2,000 jin of rice, and four pieces of printed cloth. These funds were all wasted on eating, drinking, and whoring. Poor peasant Wang Shengcai said: "All that talk about the poor people standing up, I haven't stood up, the captain has stood up himself. I fought in vain, and wasted a season's worth of work." (Zhiping)

　　坏干部胡作乱为
  　贫雇农不敢说话
  　苗小屯工作团初步了解情况
    【永年消息】永年四区苗小屯工作团，到村后即深入到贫雇家里了解村的情况，但贫农不敢与我们直接谈话，经过了几天的了解，主要是怕干部，怕区干怕村干，因去年群众反民兵队长苗林的（外号二阎王）贪污，群众正与他清算贪污帐，这时区里李坡（临洛关镇长）听说没有干部领导，群众自己起来搞，这还了得，马上派了几个民兵到苗小屯带来几个贫苦农民，不由分说叫民兵就打，贫苦老实农民王生才，当被捆时要求说理，不叫说，后来又把苗林的和被捆的几个贫农带来临洛关公安局把苗林的问了问放回，苗回到街里又镇压群众，他说：公安局和李镇长叫我回来调查的，吓的群众没人敢在街说句话。这次经过了几次动员，与贫农说明过去干部的错误，今后一定要与咱群众办事。贫农这才敢大胆的给反映意见，谈到过去民兵队长苗林的贪污、搞女人、镇压群众等主要错误如下：（一）去年运动开始，他带领着民兵到地主、富农家共私借了五户，借款三十二万元。（二）要强寻老段妹妹，老段不同意，与他闹了个难看，苗借口与老段带了个帽子，叫民兵把老段带到队部捆在板凳上，审问破坏事实，人家不承认，轧了一杠子。（三）私自派款，第一次用挖备战窑借口（因那时永定城敌人还在）派米两千余斤，说是叫群众吃，结果自己贪污。第二次派款每亩一百元，共派款十万多元，贪污了七万多元。（四）扩军派款每亩一百五十元，共派了二十四万元，给了新战士五万元，下剩十九万元借口说买子弹，实际上也没有买，都贪污了。总共一年多，贪污及私借地主款约六十五万元，米两千多斤，四个花布。这些款都大吃大喝嫖女人浪费了。贫农王生才说：“光说叫穷人翻身翻身，俺没有翻了身，都叫队长自己翻了，俺白斗了一气，白耽误了一季的活”。（治平）
