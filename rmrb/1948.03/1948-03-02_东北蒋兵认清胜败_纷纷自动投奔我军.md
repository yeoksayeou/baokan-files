Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: Since the Spring Festival, the People's Liberation Army has launched a political offensive against the KMT bandits besieged in Jilin, with significant results. In the Jilin South and Jilin North areas alone, we have received over 500 officers and soldiers from the KMT 60th Army and other units who voluntarily surrendered, including five squads who came over with their weapons. Before the Lunar New Year, we sent a large number of leaflets, letters, and New Year cards into Jilin City through various means. The KMT soldiers, suffering from hunger and cold, tried to escape and join the People's Liberation Army after receiving the propaganda. Although KMT officers tried their best to suppress them, they could not stop it. KMT soldiers Wang Xinghua, Liu Runde, and others who surrendered, before defecting to the liberated area, first asked another surrendered KMT soldier to bring a letter saying: "We are soldiers under the rule of the Kuomintang. In order to reach the embrace of the true motherland, we are determined to surrender, and we hope you will accept us." KMT soldiers who surrendered to us were warmly welcomed by the local democratic government and were sent back to their hometowns or accommodated according to their wishes. Soldiers who came over with their guns were given two dou of millet per rifle and a bonus of 10,000 yuan. The surrendered soldiers wrote letters to tell their brothers who were still suffering to quickly find a way to join the People's Liberation Army. In addition, the KMT troops entrenched in Xinmin, Benxi, and other places are also experiencing a high rate of desertion. A KMT soldier who fled from Benxi recently said that in the KMT 207th Division, 2nd Regiment, one or more months ago, each company had 120 men, and as a result of desertion, each company now has only about 90 men left.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 28th: Forty-three former KMT-Hu army officers from the Northwest People's Liberation Army Officers' Corps, at the rank of lieutenant colonel and below, are participating in work in the liberated areas, including Chen Yuqing, former lieutenant colonel captain of the Health Team of the 24th Brigade of the Hu Army, Zhu Jialebefore, major military doctor of the field hospital of the brigade, Gao Wu, major military doctor of the medical office of the former 76th Division of the Hu Army, Wang Jingzeng, captain military doctor of the field hospital of the division, and Cui Xiyao and Song Xueyu, military doctors of the 24th Brigade. At the send-off meeting before they started working, they said excitedly: "We have been hoping to do something for the people every day, and today we can achieve our goal."

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 28th: All the former KMT-Hu army officers in the Northwest People's Liberation Army Officers' Corps studied Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" and held heated discussions for two weeks. They unanimously believed that this historic document is a guiding light for the suffering people of China and the entire East to move towards brightness and happiness. They especially sent a telegram to Chairman Mao in the name of the entire group to celebrate the victory and express their heartfelt support. It stated: "It was completely wrong for us to act as tools of the four major families in the past, and it was an act that violated the interests of the people. After reading your report, we firmly believe that the people will win and Chiang and the Americans will be defeated. We vow to eliminate deception and advance in your direction."

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th: Since the Jiaohe battle in October last year, the KMT officers of school and lieutenant level liberated in Shandong battlefield, including Lu Chengyu, former lieutenant colonel chief of staff of the 211th Brigade of the reorganized 45th Division, Xiao Dingjing, lieutenant colonel director of the News Office, Chen Qinmin, lieutenant colonel deputy head of the 559th Regiment of the reorganized 65th Division, Chen Jie, colonel head of the 476th Regiment of the reorganized 64th Division, He Weiyan, major battalion commander of the Fourth Security Column of Shandong Province, and other 91 people, jointly issued a statement on January 15th to withdraw from the Kuomintang. The original text roughly stated: "The Kuomintang reactionary group, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, betrayed Mr. Sun's doctrines and policies, and used the Kuomintang as his signboard for harming the country, endangering the people and launching civil war. It is a great shame for us to have been deceived by them and acted as his tools for dictatorial betrayal of the country and launching civil war. We are now willing to withdraw from the Kuomintang on January 15th, the 37th year of the Republic of China, and sever all relations. We hereby declare."

　　东北蒋兵认清胜败
  　纷纷自动投奔我军
    【新华社东北二十九日电】春节以来，解放军向困守吉林的蒋匪发动政治攻势，成效颇大。仅吉南吉北两地，即收容自动投诚的蒋匪六十军等部官兵五百余名，其中并有五个班携械来归。旧历新年前，我曾将大批传单、书信、贺年片等以各种方法送进吉林城内，饥寒交迫的蒋匪士兵，于接获宣传品后纷纷设法逃出投奔解放军。蒋匪军官虽竭力企图镇压，但无法制止。投诚的蒋军王兴华、刘润德等，在未投奔解放区前，先托另一投诚蒋军带来一封信说：“我们是国民党统治下的士兵，为了到真正的祖国怀抱，所以我们坚决来投诚，希望你们收容。”向我投诚的蒋军士兵，均受到当地民主政府热烈欢迎，并根据他们的愿望遣送还乡或予以收留。对携枪来归的士兵，即按每支步枪发给小米两斗，奖金一万元。投诚士兵纷纷写信告诉那些还在受难的弟兄，赶快设法投到解放军来。另困踞新民本溪等地的蒋匪军，逃风亦盛，日前从本溪逃来之蒋匪士兵称：那里的蒋匪二○七师二团，在一个多月前，每连原有人数为一百二十名，逃亡结果，现在每连只剩下九十个人左右。

    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】西北解放军官团前蒋胡军官全体学习毛主席的“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告，热烈讨论达两周之久，一致认为这一历史性的文件对于全中国以及整个东方受难的人民，是一座走向光明幸福的指路碑。特全体署名致电毛主席庆祝胜利，表示衷心拥护。内称：“我们过去充当四大家族的工具是完全错误了，是违反人民利益的行为。读了你的报告，使我们坚信人民必胜，蒋美必败，我们誓愿消除蒙蔽，跟着你的方向前进。”
