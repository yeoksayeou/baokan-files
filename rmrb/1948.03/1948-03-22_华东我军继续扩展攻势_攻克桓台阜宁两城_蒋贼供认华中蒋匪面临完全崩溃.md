      Our East China Army Continues to Expand Offensive
      Captures Cities of Huantai and Funing
     Bandit Chiang Admits that Chiang Bandit Forces in Central China Face Complete Collapse
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 20th] The Front Headquarters issued Communique No. 3 stating: A portion of our army attacked Huantai on the evening of the 16th and captured the city at dawn on the 17th. The entire defending bandits, the Second Battalion of the 422nd Regiment of the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division, as well as the puppet county brigade, self-defense brigade, police, etc., were annihilated. The results of the battle are still being tallied. This is the tenth city recovered by our army since the launch of the spring offensive.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 20th] The Subei Liberation Army recovered Funing City on the 11th. The defending bandits, a regiment of the 51st Division and local bandits, abandoned large quantities of supplies and weapons and fled towards Huai'an. Currently, our Subei army controls the three cities of Shuyang, Funing, and Yeting (Yancheng), as well as the vast area of more than 500 li from the Nantong-Ganyu highway south to the suburbs of Dongtai City and north to the suburbs of Guanyun City.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th] According to news from Nanjing, bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek issued a lament at the Chiang bandit's seven-province conference in Central China, which opened on the 17th, claiming that "the war has entered a decisive stage" (according to Agence France-Presse). He also admitted: "This reservoir of Kuomintang power in Central China is facing complete collapse" (Associated Press). In the face of the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, bandit Chiang has already foreseen the sorrow of his impending death. As early as the first of this month, when Chiang Kai-shek gave a secret speech to the "Central Training Corps," he "warned Kuomintang workers that if they do not change their style, he (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) will soon become a 'prisoner'" (according to the U.S. Imperialist United Press). The Chiang bandit's seven-province "pacification" conference in Central China, attended by the Chiang bandit provincial chairmen and security commanders of Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, aimed to arrange measures to cope with the powerful army corps of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army's offensive, personally presided over by bandit Chiang, with a duration of five days.
