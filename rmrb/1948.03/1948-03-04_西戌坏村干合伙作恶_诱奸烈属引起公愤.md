Xixu Corrupt Village Cadres Collude to Do Evil
　　Inducing and Raping a Martyr's Family Member, Arousing Public Outrage
    [Shexian News] Recently, in Xixu Village, Third District of Shexian County, an incident occurred where village cadres colluded and shielded each other, inducing and raping a family member of a martyr, arousing public outrage among the masses. The facts are as follows: Farmer Li Xin had three sons and two daughters-in-law. His second son, Li Laigui, joined the army in 1943 to go to Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. At the end of 1947, Li Laigui's unit sent a letter stating that he had gloriously sacrificed in the Xiangshui battle, requesting the local government to provide compensation. However, this letter was withheld by the Xixu village cadres, who saw it as a good opportunity to realize their plan of turning the martyr Li Laigui's wife into the wife of Wang Xiting, the deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee. When Li Laigui's wife asked for the letter, the village chief Li Fugui, village public security officer Li Zhiguo, and civil education director Lian Zhongyi, among others, said: "If you agree to marry Wang Xiting, we will give you the letter." Then, under the joint arrangement of these cadres and a bad woman named Liu Jinyu, Wang Xiting lured Li Laigui's wife to Liu Jinyu's home on the third night of the lunar new year, slept with her overnight, and forced Li's wife to formally engage with him. Upon discovery of this matter, it immediately aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. The masses believed that the cadres did not first comfort and provide compensation to Li Laigui's family for his sacrifice, but instead used the letter as a threat to seize his wife. Who would be willing to join the army in the future? Some of the masses told Li Xin about this matter and led him to the district office stationed in Dongxu to reason with them. The district office instructed the village to resolve the matter. Later, after returning to the village, these masses were suppressed by the village chief and other cadres. One of the masses who spoke more was even threatened by the cadres, saying they would detain him. Civil education director Lian Zhongyi even said that Li Xin was a rich peasant and was not allowed to voice his grievances.
    However, according to Li Xin, before his second son joined the army, his eldest son had worked as a long-term laborer for landlords for several years. At that time, most of the land cultivated by his family was either mortgaged or rented. During last year's "movement," his family was classified as lower-middle peasants and was allocated two and a half mu of land as the family of a revolutionary soldier. Currently, the whole family of eight (including the second son) has a total of seventeen mu of land, which is not very good. They have a few persimmon and walnut trees and raise a donkey. In good years, the harvested grain is barely enough to eat; in bad years like last year, it is not enough. After his second son joined the army, the eldest son stayed at home, no longer worked as a long-term laborer, and did not hire anyone. At the same time, there were no debts. However, the village cadres, based on his family's three generations, reclassified him as a rich peasant this year. Some people believe that the village cadres are temporarily trying to use this method to prevent Li Xin from resisting.
    The village cadres did not admit to any wrongdoing in doing this bad thing, and even said it was "opposing rich peasants and implementing freedom of marriage." However, the masses had a different view. Due to the opposition of the masses, on the sixteenth (seventh day of the lunar new year) afternoon, the village cadres arranged a meeting, intending to hastily resolve this issue by announcing that Wang Xiting's marriage was voluntary and closing the matter. However, they did not expect that news of the meeting attracted many people, and many masses came to participate. The masses were generally dissatisfied, and the matter could not be resolved on the spot, so it had to be handed over to the district for handling. The village chief, civil education director, and others immediately jointly wrote a letter, taking the person to the district office. The joint letter still stated that their marriage was voluntary and hoped for a resolution. The district office personnel finally decided, based on the opinions of the masses: 1. Wang Xiting will never be allowed to marry Li Laigui's wife; 2. The village cadres colluded and shielded each other in this matter; 3. Wang Xiting will be detained in the district office for education; 4. The village cadres will also be criticized for shielding lawbreakers. The matter was thus temporarily concluded.
    The Wang Xiting rape case reflects that some village cadres in Xixu have completely separated from the masses and have formed small factions to lord over them.

### 西戌坏村干合伙作恶　诱奸烈属引起公愤

　　西戌坏村干合伙作恶
  　诱奸烈属引起公愤
    【涉县消息】涉县三区西戌村最近发生了一件村干部串通一气、互相包庇、诱奸烈属，引起群众公愤的事。事实经过如下：农民李馨，有三子二媳。次子李来贵四三年参军去陕甘宁，四七年底，李来贵所在部队来信，说他在响水战斗中，光荣牺牲，要求当地政府给以抚恤。但是这封信被西戌村干部扣了起来，认为是个好机会，以便实现把烈属李来贵妻变成武委会副主任王喜亭老婆的计划。当李来贵妻要这封信时，村长李富贵、村公安员李治国、民教主任连忠义等则说：“你要是答应与王喜亭结婚，就给你信。”接着在这些干部和一个坏女人刘金鱼共同布置下，王喜亭在阴历年初三夜里将李来贵妻诱至刘金鱼家中，睡了一夜，并迫李妻与其正式订婚。这件事发觉后，立即引起群众的不满。群众认为：干部不先为李来贵的牺牲向他家里慰问和进行抚恤，反而以不给信为要胁，搞人家老婆，以后谁愿意去参军呢？有些群众即把这件事告诉给了李馨，并领他去驻东戌的区公所说理。区公所将此事批到村上解决。后来回到村上，这些群众遭到村长及其他干部的压制，其中一位讲话较多的群众，并且还被干部威吓，说要扣起他。民教主任连忠义更说李馨是富农，不允许说屈。
    但据李馨所说：次子参军前，其长子曾为地主作过几年长工，那时，家中所种土地，多半是典来和租来的。去年“运动”时，他家被订为下中农，并以抗属资格分到二亩半地。现在，全家八口人（次子在内），共十七亩地，不很好，几棵柿树和核桃树，养一条毛驴。所打粮食，好年景勉强够吃，象去年收成不好，就不够吃。其次子参军后，长子即在家，不再当长工，也不雇人，同时也没有债务关系。村干部则按他家三代，今年将他又订为富农。有人以为村干部是临时想用这个办法，使李馨不敢反抗。
    村干部们做这坏事，竟自认并无不对，而且说是什么“反对富农，实行婚姻自由”。但是群众的看法却是两样。由于群众的反对，十六日（阴历初七）下午，村干部布置了一个会议，想草草解决这个问题，宣布王喜亭的婚姻是双方自愿，就此了事。可是没想到这个开会消息，吸引了许多群众，前来参加的人很多，群众普遍不满，当场解决不了，只好交到区上处理。村长、民教主任等当即联名写了一信，把人带到区公所去。联名信上还是说他们婚姻自愿，希望解决。区公所人员最后根据群众意见决定：一、永远不让王喜亭与李来贵妻结婚；二、在这件事上，村干部是串通的，互相包庇的；三、把王喜亭留在区公所，进行教育；四、对村干部包庇犯法亦进行批评。这件事就这样暂告一段落。
    从王喜亭的诱奸案中反映出西戌有些村干部已完全脱离了群众，并结成小宗派在群众头上作威作福。
