Xinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 18th -- After the People's Liberation Army entered Luoyang City, it protected the legitimate activities of churches, which was deeply praised by Christians in the city. On the morning of the 13th, when the remnants of the enemy in the northwest corner of the city were still putting up a final stubborn resistance, order in the eastern part of the city was quickly restored. The Gospel Church on Mingxin Street held prayers as usual. Many Christians gathered around the staff of the People's Liberation Army, listening to the People's Liberation Army's policy on religious freedom. Chen Zhongli, an elder of the church, gratefully held a comrade's hand and said, "I will pray to the Lord to bless you." On the morning of the 14th, the church hung out a "Today's Worship" sign as usual and rang the church bells. Church members from all streets went to the church to do their "homework."

　　洛阳市基督教徒
  　颂扬我宗教自由政策
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十八日电】解放军进驻洛阳城后，保护教堂正当活动，深获该城基督教徒的颂扬。十三日清晨当城西北角残敌尚在进行最后顽抗时，东城秩序迅即恢复，明新街福音堂照常的举行祷告，许多教徒围在解放军工作人员的身旁，倾听解放军对宗教自由的政策，该堂长老陈中立欣慰的拉住一位同志的手说：“我定向主祷告保佑你们”。十四日清晨该堂照例挂出“今日礼拜”牌，扬起教堂的钟声，各街教友们纷纷前往该堂做他们的“功课”。
