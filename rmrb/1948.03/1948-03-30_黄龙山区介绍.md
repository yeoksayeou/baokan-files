Introduction to the Huanglong Mountain Area

　　Huanglong Mountain is a mountainous area at the southern end of the Liangshan mountain range, including the nine townships and sixty-four "bao" (units of local administration) divided by the Chiang Kai-shek party. It is bounded by Hancheng to the east, Luochuan to the west, Yichuan and Xunyi counties to the north, and south to the south of Huanglong Town, bordering Hequan and Chengcheng. It is 120 li wide from east to west and over 300 li long from north to south, covering an area of 36,000 square li. The terrain is very high in the east, sloping to the southwest. The southern part, below the Hutishan and Shegongshan mountains (both over 1,200 meters high) south of Shifu Town, is the Bai(shui) - Cheng(cheng) highland, and below that is the Guanzhong Plain.
    The main food crop in the mountainous area is corn (maize), followed by wheat. In addition, coal, oil, fur, and medicinal materials are also produced.
    The Huanglong Mountain area is a shield for northern Shaanxi. It can control the Yellow River crossings to the east, and the important cities such as Luochuan on the Xianyang-Yulin highway to the southwest. If an attack is launched to the south, it can directly approach Tongguan and threaten Xi'an, so its strategic position is very important. In 1937, the local forces in Shaanxi once designated the mountainous area as a reclamation area, establishing a reclamation bureau as its military and economic base. After the arrival of Chiang Kai-shek's (central) forces in 1939, they forcibly nationalized this area and changed the reclamation bureau to an administrative bureau, directly under the jurisdiction of the Chiang Kai-shek party's puppet Executive Yuan. For more than a decade, Hu Zongnan's bandit troops have often stationed heavy troops here, using it as an important military base for invading the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. During the civil war, the Huanglong Mountain area was a guerrilla area for the Red Army, so the local people have a high level of awareness. During the period when Hu's bandits occupied the area, there were heavy taxes and levies, and the people's lives were very difficult. They had repeatedly organized uprisings and fought against Hu's bandits. In October of last year, a part of our Northwest Liberation Army entered the Huanglong Mountain area and liberated important towns such as Yichuan, Baishui, Hancheng, and Shifu Town, where Chiang Kai-shek's administrative office was located, and established new liberated areas, establishing democratic governments at all levels. In February of this year, a military region was officially established. This time, the Northwest Liberation Army went south in force and created a great victory by annihilating five full brigades of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in the Yichuan area, successively liberating Yichuan, Baishui, Yijun,中部(Zhongbu, could also be translated as "Central District" as it could also be a place name, requires more context), Xunyi, Hancheng and many important towns, cutting off the southern section of the Xianyang-Yulin highway, the lifeline of Hu's bandit military transportation, so that the important strategic strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan in Yan'an and Luochuan were completely isolated and surrounded by the Liberation Army on all sides. More than 20,000 of Hu's bandits are like turtles in a jar, with nowhere to escape. At this point, the Huanglong Mountain area and our Guanzhong sub-region are completely connected in a vast area, forming a strategic situation of flanking Hu Zongnan's lair in Xi'an.

　　黄龙山区介绍
    黄龙山，是梁山山脉南端的一个山区，包括蒋党所划分的九个乡，六十四个保。东界韩城，西接洛川，北连宜川、＠县，南至黄龙镇以南，和泉、澄城接界。东西宽一百二十里，南北长三百多里，面积三万六千平方里。地势东部很高，向西南倾斜，南部在石辅镇以南的壶梯山、舍公山（均高一千二百多公尺）以下，是白（水）澄（城）高原塬地，再下就是关中平原。
    山区主要的食粮是包谷（玉茭），其次是麦子。此外，煤炭、石油、皮毛、药材等也有出产。
    黄龙山区，是陕北的屏障，东面可以控制黄河各渡口，西南可以控制咸榆公路的洛川等重要城市。如果向南出击，可以直逼潼关，威胁西安，所以在战略上的地位很重要。一九三七年，陕西地方势力曾将山区划为垦植区，设有垦植局，作为其军事经济根据地。三九年蒋匪（中央）势力到达后，强迫把这块地方收归“国有”改垦植局为设治局，直接归蒋党伪行政院管辖。十几年来，胡宗南匪部经常在这里驻有重兵，把这里作为侵犯陕甘宁边区的重要军事基地。内战时期，黄龙山区便是红军的游击区，因此当地人民的觉悟很高，胡匪盘踞时期，苛杂繁重，人民生活困苦不堪，曾数度自动组织暴动，与胡匪展开斗争。去年十月，我西北解放军一部，进入黄龙山区，曾解放宜川、白水、韩城及蒋匪设治所在地的石辅镇等重要城镇，建立了新的解放区，成立各级民主政府，今年二月并正式成立军区。此次西北解放军大军南下，在宜川地区创造歼灭蒋胡匪五个整旅的伟大胜利，接连解放宜川、白水、宜君、中部、＠县、韩城及重要市镇多处，切断胡匪军事交通命脉咸（阳）榆（林）公路南段，使延安、洛川蒋胡匪重要战略据点完全陷于孤立，处于解放军四面包围的境地，两万多胡匪有如瓮中之鳖，无路可逃。至此，黄龙山区与我关中分区在广大地区完全接连一片，形成夹击胡匪老巢西安的战略形势。
