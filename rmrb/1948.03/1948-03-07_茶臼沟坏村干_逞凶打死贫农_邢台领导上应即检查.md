(Editor's Note) Any issue in the village should be handled reasonably and according to the law. If a crime has been committed and there is solid evidence, it should be dealt with according to the severity of the crime. Minor offenses can be addressed through persuasion and education in the village, while serious offenses should be immediately reported to higher authorities for handling. Under no circumstances should the village arbitrarily detain or torture anyone, let alone beat them to death.

The killing of a person arbitrarily by the cadres and militia of Chá Us Gōu village is a very serious matter. The leaders in Xíngtái should immediately investigate and deal with this matter, and punish the offenders, distinguishing between principal and accessory offenders, according to the law. This cannot be treated lightly.

[Xíngtái News] Song Yumei, a poor peasant in Chá Us Gōu village, Eighth District, is 22 years old and lives with only his mother. On the evening of the third day of the first lunar month this year, Song Yumei went to visit a household that was being struggled against. He was talking with two women when the militia captain, Song Shiqing, looked at his door. Later, one of the women left, and Song Shiqing locked the door. He immediately gathered the cadres and militia, tied Song Yumei to the winter school, and hung him from a beam. The militia stood guard, preventing the masses from approaching. The cadres and militia inside beat him half to death. Two poor peasant militia members said, "Let him down." Song Shiqing, the director of the armed committee, said, "Tonight, no one can care for him." Later, he was beaten again. Afterwards, Song Mingxian, a family member of a revolutionary soldier, took him down and sent him home. He died not long after. Later, the village cadres reported to the district that Song Yumei had been beaten to death. The district cadres immediately went to the village and held a meeting with several poor peasants and hired laborers, but the masses did not speak boldly, and it is not known how to handle the matter.

　　茶臼沟坏村干
  　逞凶打死贫农
  　邢台领导上应即检查
    （编者按）村里处理任何问题，都应讲道理按法令办事。犯了罪确有证据，则应分别轻重，轻的可在村说服教育，重的则应随即送上级处理。无论对谁，村里都不能随便扣压吊打，更不准把人打死。
    茶臼沟村干民兵，随便打死人，这是个十分严重的问题，这件事，邢台领导上应马上检查处理，并给违法者分别主从依法制裁，不能马虎了事。
    【邢台消息】八区茶臼沟村，贫农宋玉梅，现年二十二岁，家中只有他母子二人。今年正月初三日晚上，宋玉梅到一个被斗户家串门子，和两个女人在谈话，民兵队长宋诗清去他门上看了看，后来走了一个女人，宋诗清就把门子锁了。他就马上找干部集合民兵，把宋玉梅绑到冬学，吊在梁头上，民兵站着岗，不叫群众去，干部民兵在里边打了他一个半死。有两个贫雇民兵说：“把他卸下来吧。”武委会主任宋诗清说：“今天晚上谁也不能顾他。”后来又打了一顿，以后有个抗属宋明宪把他卸下送到他家，不大时候就死了。以后村干部到区汇报把宋玉梅打死了，区干部马上到村找了几个贫雇开会，但群众说话不大胆，不知如何处理。（宋士群、王廷连）
