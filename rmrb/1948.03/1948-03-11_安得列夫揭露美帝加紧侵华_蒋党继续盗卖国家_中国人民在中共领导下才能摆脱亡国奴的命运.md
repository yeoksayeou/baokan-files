　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Moscow broadcast Andreyev's commentary on the 20th of last month, exposing the increasingly intensified aggression of U.S. imperialism in China. Andreyev said: "The economic expansion of U.S. imperialism in China is closely coordinated with its military and political expansion. According to information received: When Wedemeyer was in Nanjing, he signed a secret agreement with Chiang Kai-shek, in which the United States obtained the right to build military bases, construct railways, and operate existing railways in China (Chiang-controlled areas). It also obtained the right to long-term lease of Taiwan and unlimited supervision over the Kuomintang; in addition, Chiang Kai-shek also agreed to participate in the so-called Pacific Group designed and formed under the leadership of the United States, including Japan, the Philippines, Siam, and South Korea, and agreed to the U.S. terms for a peace treaty with Japan. After this agreement received final approval from Washington, Wedemeyer sent it to Nanjing as instructions to Chiang Kai-shek." Andreyev further pointed out: "Simultaneous with the expansion of military and political aggression against China, the United States is further persecuting democratic elements in the Kuomintang areas. The dissolution of many democratic parties and social organizations, and the arrest and killing of patriotic and democratic elements from all walks of life, are all conducted under the leadership and direct participation of U.S. intelligence agencies in China." Finally, Andreyev said: "This treasonous policy of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which serves the interests of American monopoly capitalists, makes the Chinese people see more clearly that only by uniting closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, forming a national united front, and fighting to restore national sovereignty and establish a free, independent, and strong China, can they escape the fate of becoming enslaved people."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: The aerial "exploration" of the Jishi Mountains, a plan formulated by the U.S. imperialists to invade the hinterland of Northwest China, is being actively carried out. Reynold, the head of the survey team who returned to the United States from China in late January, arrived back in Shanghai on the 7th. Those who came with him included the team's administrative director Lai Wei, aviation pilot Orton, aviation engineer Shali, geologist Ge Luo, scientific instrument expert Mackay, photography expert Ross, and others, six people in total. The "C-27" giant plane they were traveling on carried thirty tons of "luggage" (according to a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency). According to a commentary broadcast by Moscow Radio on the 20th, Reynold is a famous American detective who has always served the U.S. military and completed his mission in Trieste. Now he is in China for a special mission of "exploration". It is reported that in addition to U.S. military officers accompanying the "exploration", four people from Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense and one person from Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Communications are also participating.

　　安得列夫揭露美帝加紧侵华
  　蒋党继续盗卖国家
    中国人民在中共领导下才能摆脱亡国奴的命运
    【新华社陕北八日电】莫斯科上月二十日广播安得列夫评论，揭露美帝国主义在中国的日益加紧的侵略活动。安得列夫说：“美帝国主义在华的经济扩张，是与其军事、政治扩张密切配合着的。根据得到的消息：魏德迈在南京时曾和蒋介石签署秘密协定，美国已获得建筑军事基地权，建筑铁路和从事经营中国（蒋区）现有铁路的权利，它又获得台湾的长期租借权，和对国民党的无限监督权；此外，蒋介石又答应参加美国领导下设计组成的日、菲、暹和南韩的所谓太平洋集团，和同意美国的对日和约条件。当这个协定得到华盛顿最后赞同之后，魏德迈随即将它送往南京，作为对蒋介石的指令。”安得列夫又指出：“与加强对华军事、政治侵略的扩张同时，美国又进一步迫害国民党区民主分子。许多民主政党和社会团体的被解散，各阶层爱国民主分子的被捕被杀，都是美国驻华侦探机关领导和直接参加进行的。”最后，安得列夫说：“国民党反动分子这种服从美国独占资本家利益的卖国政策，使中国人民更加看清了，只有紧密团结在中国共产党领导下，组成民族统一战线，为恢复国家主权，建立自由、独立和强盛的中国而奋斗，才能罢脱亡国奴的命运。”
    【新华社陕北九日电】美帝为侵入中国西北部腹地而制定的空中“探测”积石山计划，正积极进行中。一月下旬由华返美之该勘测团团长雷诺，七日已返抵上海。同来者包括该团事务主任赖威、航空驾驶员欧顿、航空工程师沙礼、地质学家葛罗、科学仪器专家麦凯、摄影专家罗斯等六人，彼等乘坐之“Ｃ二七”巨型飞机载来“行李”三十吨　（据蒋匪中央社电讯）。据莫斯科电台二十日广播评论称：雷诺为一美国著名侦探，一向为美军部服务，曾在的里雅斯特完成了自己的使命，现在则是负有特别任务来华“探测”的。据悉：此次“探测”除有美国军官伴随外，并有蒋匪国防部四人及蒋匪交通部一人参加。
