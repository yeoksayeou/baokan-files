Coal in the United States
·Ding Mang·

It is said there is a story in the United States:

In winter, the cold wind is biting and chilling to the bone. A poor child, shivering all over, asks his father:

"Dad, isn't there a lot of coal in the coal yard? Why don't we have coal to burn?"

"It's because there is too much coal in the coal yard."

This dialogue vividly portrays the contradiction of the capitalist production system: the socialization of production versus the private ownership.

The coal reserves in the United States amount to 38 trillion tons, accounting for more than half of the total reserves in the capitalist world. Extraction increased to 520 million tons by 1940, more than twice that of aging Britain – Britain only had 19.2 million tons.

However, despite the abundant production, you can't even dream of burning coal without money. That's why the naive story of that child circulates among people, and coal has also become a political weapon of the American reactionaries. Not long ago, the United States transported a large amount of coal to the reactionary German government, attempting to add some heat to that cold machine.

Coal, like other industries, is also controlled by a few financial groups. For example, the Rockefeller Group controls the largest Colorado Fuel and Iron Company in the West. This company is known for two things: first, manipulating Colorado's politics; its politics are ruthlessly suppressing striking workers. The Ludlow Massacre in 1914, caused by the anti-war increased capital movement, was committed by this company. At that time, the workers' tent residential area was burned to the ground, and many of the workers' wives and children were burned to death.

After World War I, Rockefeller further infiltrated the Consolidation Coal Company (which mines coal in Maryland, West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and Pennsylvania), which, like the former company, is notorious for its brutal suppression of workers. In addition, Rockefeller also controls the Davis Coal and Coke Company.

As for the Morgan Group and others, they also have a large influence in the coal mining industry.

Although the degree of mechanization in the American coal industry is very high, this is due to the capitalists' efforts to strengthen the exploitation and oppression of workers and reduce production costs. Due to the implementation of rationalization, the intensity of labor has increased, and the energy consumption of workers is extremely high, so aging and casualties have also increased. The most reactionary American magazine "Reader's Digest" has to admit: the number of coal miners injured or killed in accidents reaches as many as 7,000 each year. However, two years ago, the coal miners' request for the management to set up a welfare fund was rejected, and it was only after the workers insisted on striking that they were forced to agree. And this time, they went back on their word and did not fulfill the terms of establishing a retirement annuity in last year's contract. This is the hideous face of the capitalists towards the workers.

At present, the American coal miners' union, the United Mine Workers of America, has 400,000 members. Since 1919, there have been several major strikes, and this is already the sixth major strike. In the struggle to improve living and working conditions, American miners have demonstrated a high degree of militancy and solidarity. The union leader, Lewis, is an ambitious villain who often wants to use the workers' struggle to achieve his own self-interest. Last year's strike struggle ended because he surrendered to the reactionary government.

Coal is widely used in American industry. Among the industries that rely on coal for fuel, electricity accounts for 51 percent, trains 81 percent, and household fuel 55 percent. If 400,000 coal miners in 21 states go on strike for one day, coal production can be reduced by 2 million tons, which has a very large impact on industry. If the strike persists, it could affect factories employing 25 million people.

At present, although the wages of coal miners per hour have increased from 50 cents in 1933 to 146 cents as a result of previous struggles, due to the current high prices, a monthly income of more than 200 yuan is still not enough to eat and wear warmly. It is said that at least $3,500 a year is needed to maintain a basic standard of living.

Truman used a ban last year to prohibit coal miners from striking, and this time he brazenly used the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to decide to take barbaric measures to suppress the strike, which shows the increasing fascization of American imperialism.

### 煤在美国

　　煤在美国
    ·丁氓·
    据说美国有个故事：
    冬于，寒风凛冽，冰人心骨，一个穷孩子全身冻得发抖，哆嗦地问他爸爸：
    “爹，煤栈里煤不是很多么？为什么我们没有煤烧？”
    “就是因为煤栈里煤太多了。”
    这对话生动地刻划出资本主义生产制度的矛盾。——生产的社会化与占有的私人性。
    美国煤的蓄存量达三万八千万万吨，占资本主义世界总蓄存量的一半以上。采掘到一九四○年增加到五万二千万吨，比衰老的英国高出两倍——英国仅一万九千二百万吨。
    但是，出产尽管多，没有钱却休想烧煤。因此才有那个小孩天真的故事，流传人间，而且煤也一样成为美国反动派的政治武器，不久以前美国曾经运了大批的煤给德国反动政府，企图为那冷厥的机器，加一些热力。
    煤，和其他工业一样，也被少数几个金融集团控制着。例如洛克菲勒集团即控制了西部最大的科罗拉多燃料与铁公司。这个公司以两件事情闻名于世：第一是操纵科罗拉多州的政治；其政治是残酷无情地镇压罢工工人。一九一四年因反战的增资运动而引起的鲁德罗大屠杀案，便是这个公司干出来的。当时工人的帐蓬住宅区被焚毁一空，工人的妻儿子女被烧死不少。
    在第一次大战以后，洛克菲勒更渗入团结煤业公司（这个公司在马里兰州、西佛吉民亚州、肯达基州东部和宾夕伐尼亚州开采煤矿），它也和前一公司同样以残酷镇压工人而臭名远扬。此外，洛克菲勒还控制台维斯煤与焦煤公司。
    至于摩根等集团，在煤矿工业中也有很大的势力。
    美国的煤业机械化的程度虽然很高，但这是资本家为了加强对工人的剥削与压榨，减低生产成本而来的。由于合理化的实行劳动程度增高对于工人的精力消耗极大，衰老与伤亡也就随之增加。美国最反动的杂志“读者文摘”也不得不承认：煤矿工人由于失事的伤亡，每年达七千余名之巨。然而前年煤矿工人要求资方设立福利基金，竟遭拒绝，后来因工人坚持罢工，才被迫答应。而这次更食言自肥，不履行去年所订合同中建立养老年金的条款。这就是资本家对工人的狰狞面貌。
    目前美国煤矿工人的工会——矿工联合会有会员四十万。从一九一九年起，有过好几次大罢工，这一次已经是第六次大罢工了。在为改善生活与工作条件的斗争中，美国矿工表现了高度的战斗性与团结性。工会领袖路易斯却是一个野心勃勃的奸雄，时常想利用工人的斗争达到一己的私利。去年的罢工斗争就是因为他向反动政府投降而给束了的。
    煤在美国工业上的用途十分广泛。靠煤为燃料的工业，计电力占百分之五十一，火车百分之八十一，家庭燃料百分之五十五。如果四十万煤工在廿一州中全体罢工一天，可以减少煤产二百万吨，对于工业的影响是非常大的。如果罢工坚持下去，可以影响二千五百万人做工的工厂。
    现在煤矿工人的工资，每小时虽因历次斗争的结果已由三三年的五十分增至一四六分，但因目前物价的高涨，每月二百余元的收入，仍是吃不饱穿不暖的。据说每年至少要三千五百美元，才能维持温饱。
    杜鲁门去年曾以禁令禁止煤矿工人罢工，这次又悍然运用塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法，决定采取野蛮的镇压罢工，这是表现了美帝日益法西斯化。
