Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the China Labor Association, who recently arrived in the Northeast Liberated Area, stated in an interview with a reporter from this agency: "The Chinese People's Revolutionary War will surely be victorious, and the united front of world democratic countries against American imperialism will surely be victorious. My personal experience of going to Europe four times in the past three years, and then from the KMT-controlled area to the Liberated Area, proves this beyond any doubt. Experience also proves that this victory can only be guaranteed by the great unity of people's democracy under the leadership of an advanced political party. The people of all ethnic groups, classes, and professions in China, who are doubly oppressed by the KMT bandits internally and American imperialism externally, can only complete the historical task of thoroughly liberating themselves under the leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao."

Mr. Zhu continued: "When I stepped on the land of the Liberated Area, I immediately felt an irresistible force and vigorous vitality. The stability of social order and the abundance of people's lives are incomparable to the KMT-controlled area. The workers, peasants, and citizens, even national capitalists, in the KMT area can barely breathe under the double pressure of the bureaucratic capital of the four families of Chiang Kai-shek and others combined with American monopoly capital. However, their level of awareness is higher than at any previous time. In the near future, with the support of the military and civilians in the Liberated Area, they will surely achieve emancipation. Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt and fascist rule cannot continue to be maintained." Mr. Zhu said: "In the struggle against Chiang, there is no middle ground to follow, because this struggle is the final decisive battle between the people of the whole country and the largest and most vicious feudal and reactionary dynasty in history. Every patriotic ordinary person will express their attitude in this decisive battle."

Mr. Zhu spoke at length about the international situation, pointing out: "The significance and situation of the struggle between the two camps of democracy and anti-democracy internationally is almost exactly the same as the struggle between the two camps in our country. The awakened European people are unanimously and vehemently opposed to the Marshall Plan for expansion. Even if there are a few reactionary governments in those countries that disobey the will of the people and bow down to American imperialism, the power of the people will ultimately overwhelm everything. For example, the recent complete smashing of the reactionary coup plot by the Czech people is the best proof. Look at those countries that have temporarily occupied the ruling position and accepted the Marshall Plan. The hardship of the people's lives is even worse than that of the Soviet people during the war. For example, every Briton can only enjoy a ration of one egg per month, and the French only have 200 grams (approximately equal to 6.4 Chinese ounces) of bread per day. However, the new democracies in Eastern Europe, which maintain friendly and mutually beneficial relations with the Soviet Union, are rapidly recovering from the wounds of war, and the people's lives are also improving. In particular, the Soviet Union, the backbone of the world's peaceful and democratic forces, although it suffered the deepest wounds in the war, is recovering the fastest, and some production has even exceeded pre-war levels. At the end of last year, the Soviet Union abolished the rationing system for daily necessities, and all items can be fully supplied at low prices. Now, every Soviet citizen can get eggs for one breakfast that every British citizen can only get in three months. The two camps produce such a clear contrast, and it is certain that the people of all countries in the anti-democratic camp will struggle for survival and to overthrow their domestic and foreign reactionary rule, and victory is also certain." Mr. Zhu finally stated: "The reason why I resolutely came to the Liberated Area is to devote myself to this great revolutionary cause to the best of my ability. From now on, I am willing to work together with the military and civilians in the Liberated Area under the guidance of Chairman Mao to fight to the end to crush the Chiang regime and liberate the people of the whole country."

　　中国各民族各阶层人民
  　受毛主席领导才能解放
    朱学范氏对新华社记者发表谈话
    【新华社东北七日电】日前抵达东北解放区的世界职工联合会副主席、中国劳动协会理事长朱学范氏，于接见本社记者时称：“中国人民革命战争必胜，世界民主国家反美帝统一战线必胜；以我近三年来四度赴欧，又从蒋管区走到解放区之亲身经历，证明实毋容置疑。经验也证明：这种胜利只有在先进政党领导下的人民民主大团结，才有保证。中国内受蒋贼外受美帝双层压迫的各民族、各阶层及各种职业的人民，只有在中共及毛主席领导之下，方能完成彻底解放自己的历史伟业。”
    朱氏继称：“当我踏上解放区土地时，立刻感到这里有着一种不可压抑的力量和蓬勃的朝气，社会秩序的安定和人民生活的充裕，实为蒋管区所不能比拟。而蒋区的工人、农民和市民以至民族资本家们，在蒋介石等四大家族官僚资本结合着美国垄断资本的双层重压下喘不过气来，但他们的觉悟程度，是还较以前任何时期为高了。他们在不久的将来，一定会在解放区军民支援下获得翻身的，蒋介石的腐朽的法西斯统治是决不能继续维持下去的。”朱氏说：“在反蒋的斗争中，决无中间路线可循，因为这个斗争是全国人民与历史上最大的穷凶极恶的封建、反动王朝最后的决战，每个爱国的老百姓，在决战中都将表白自己的态度”。
    朱氏畅论国际形势，指出：“国际间民主与反民主两个阵营的斗争和我国内两个阵营斗争的意义和情况，几乎完全一样。觉悟了的欧洲人民，一致猛烈反对马歇尔扩张计划，纵然那里还有少数几个国家的反动政府违背人民意志，向美帝卑躬屈膝，但人民的力量，终究是会压倒一切的。比方最近捷克人民彻底粉碎了反动派政变阴谋，就是最好的证明。试看那几个反动派暂时占住统治地位的接受了马歇尔计划的国家，人民生活的困苦还远较战时的苏联人民为苦。如每个英国人要一个月才能享受一个鸡蛋的配给，法国人每天只有两百个格兰姆（按约等中国六市两四钱重）的面包，然而与苏联维持友好互惠的东欧新民主主义国家则正在迅速恢复战争的创伤，人民生活也正在改善。尤其是世界和平民主力量中坚的苏联，她虽然在战争中受创最深，但她恢复最快，某些生产且超过了战前的水平，去年年底苏联已取消了日用品配给制，各项物品都可得到充分的廉价的供给。现在每个苏联人一顿早餐，就可获得每一英国人三个月才能得到的鸡蛋。两个阵营产生两种如此鲜明的对照，反民主阵营内各国人民之欲为生存、为推翻其国内外反动统治而斗争是肯定了的，胜利也是肯定了的。”朱氏最后表示：“我之所以毅然来到解放区，即是要竭尽所能投身此一伟大的革命事业，今后愿在毛主席指导之下与解放区军民一道，为粉碎蒋政权解放全国人民而奋斗到底”。
