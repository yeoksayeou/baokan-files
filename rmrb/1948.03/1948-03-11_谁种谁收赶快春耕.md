　　Whoever Plants, Harvests: Hurry Up with Spring Plowing
　　Our Border Region Government issued a proclamation on March 8th, stipulating several measures, the main idea being that land distributed before Qingming should be planted by whoever it was distributed to. If the original owner has already planted wheat, etc., it should still be harvested by the original planter; if the land has been plowed or manure has been applied, the original owner should be compensated with equivalent value. For land distributed around Qingming, whoever has been planting it should continue to do so, and no matter who the land is distributed to after planting, the grain will still be harvested by the original planter. In short, whoever plants, harvests. No matter when the land is distributed, or to whom, no one will suffer any losses. The proclamation also states that in most areas here, land will not undergo major changes, only minor adjustments, and there will definitely be no disruptive redistribution. Everyone can rest assured and hurry up with spring plowing.

　　谁种谁收赶快春耕
    咱们边区政府三月八号发了个布告，规定了几项办法，主要意思是说在清明前分了的土地，分给谁谁就种。如原主已种了麦子等，还应归原种人收；如已犁过或送了粪土，应给原主等价补偿。清明前后分的地，是谁的谁还种着，不管种后再分给谁，粮食还由原来种的人收。总之，是谁种谁收，不管地啥时候分，或分给谁，一点不会吃亏。布告又说咱们这里大部地方土地都不会大变动，只是抽抽补补，绝不是打乱平分，大家放心赶快春耕吧。
