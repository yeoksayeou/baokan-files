To the Editor:

　　The February 24th issue reported that Beijia Wall Village in the Sixth District of Cixian County was using fruit and arbitrarily mobilizing funds from the masses to run the opera troupe, and using the funds allocated for rectification of finances to invest in mutual aid groups, asking the masses to engage in production. The two incidents reported were factual, and both have now been inspected and corrected. The situation is explained as follows: The funds mobilized from the masses have not yet been collected and have been stopped; the rice and wheat eaten from the masses and the cloth used from the masses will definitely be returned to the masses. Furthermore, the practice of asking the masses to engage in production for the village's finances, stipulating dividends, was corrected in December, and the funds were withdrawn. The withdrawn funds have now been invested in the village cooperative's credit department for adjustment and distribution to the masses. This report has been of great help to us.

  　检查北贾壁剧团错处都改正过来编辑同志：
    二月廿四号报登载磁县六区北贾壁村，拿果实和随便向群众动员款搞剧团，拿整财款投入互助组，叫群众给搞生产，登的两个事情都实际，现都检查改过了。情况说明如下：动员群众的款，还没有起，已经不叫群众拿了；吃群众的米麦和使群众的布匹，也一定要退还群众。再一个叫群众给村财政搞生产，规定红利，在腊月间就改正了，把款抽回了，抽回来的款现已投入到村合作社信用部调剂给群众了。这次登的这个事，对我们帮助很大。　　　　　（磁县六区杨三才）
