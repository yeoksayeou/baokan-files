　　[Report from Taihang by our newspaper] The Huojia Detachment of the Fourth Military Sub-district is actively working to oppose the enemy's conscription. The Jiang bandits stationed in Wuzhi and Huojia have recently been forcibly enlisting recruits. According to recruits who have fled to our area, since the Lunar New Year, the Jiang bandits have forcibly drafted recruits four times in their occupied areas of Wuzhi. The first time, seven men were drafted, the second time five, the third time seven, and the most recent time at least twenty to forty. Many young and middle-aged men who are unwilling to die for the enemy have fled to our area. Local irregular troops and township Bao-Jia offices are extorting the recruits for money to enrich themselves. A 26-year-old youth from Wuyangzhuang Village in Xiuwu-Huojia had to give ten "shi" of wheat to Guo Zhaoqing, a Huojia irregular soldier, to save his life. On the 8th of this month, Zhao Choujiu's troops, local bullies from Wuzhi, with eighty-some men, went to the Fucun area to conscript recruits. Upon hearing this, the Third Detachment of our Huojia and the Second District Armed Work Team went to pursue them. The enemy turned around and ran upon seeing us charging towards them. We rescued the fifty recruits who had been captured by the enemy. Song Xiaogou, one of the rescued recruits, said with emotion, "If you hadn't driven away the thugs, who knows how many people in our village they would have taken away."
