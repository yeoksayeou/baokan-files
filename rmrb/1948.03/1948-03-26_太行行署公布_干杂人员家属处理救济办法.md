　　Taihang Administrative Office Announces
  　Measures for Handling and Providing Relief to Families of Cadres and Miscellaneous Staff
    [Taihang News] The Taihang Administrative Office announced on March 6th measures for handling and providing relief to the families of Party, government, and civil cadres, workers, and miscellaneous staff. The measures first strictly criticized the parasitic mentality that existed among some family members in the past, who simply relied on relief grain, as well as the reluctance of some family members from laboring backgrounds to work after coming out, or their tendency to only study culture and look down on labor. In particular, it criticized the continued practice of living without labor by some family members from landlord backgrounds. Regarding the handling of families of cadres and miscellaneous staff in the future, the measures emphasized combining relief with labor and production, and resolutely overcoming the past parasitic mentality of simply relying on relief grain. The main provisions are as follows: All family schools and women's vocational schools in various regions should be uniformly transformed into family factories, focusing on labor and technical learning, with the goal of becoming self-sufficient in living expenses within half a year. For those whose families are in the district and have labor power and can maintain their livelihood, those who have already come out should be sent back home to engage in labor and production, and those who have not come out should not be allowed to come out under any circumstances. If there are special circumstances requiring them to come out, it must be approved by the organ's family committee and the head of the organ. Those whose families are in other liberated areas, KMT-controlled areas, or whose families are in the district but have not had contact with their families for many years and have no labor power and cannot live, can be sent to family factories. For elderly parents and biological children of cadres and workers whose families are in KMT-controlled areas and have fled to this district due to enemy threats, if they cannot live, appropriate subsidies can be provided from the family relief grain.

　　太行行署公布
  　干杂人员家属处理救济办法
    【太行消息】此间行署于三月六日公布党政民干部工务人员（杂务人员）家属处理救济办法。该办法首对过去家属中存在的单纯吃救济粮的寄生思想，及一部分劳动出身的家属出来后也不愿劳动，或者光学文化轻视劳动，特别是一部分地主出身的出来后仍过不劳而食的生活，做了严格的批判。在今后干杂人员家属的处理上，指出了救济与劳动生产结合、坚决克服过去那种单纯吃救济粮的寄生思想。规定主要内容是：各地家属学校及女子职业学校应一律改为家属工厂，以劳动与学习技术为主，做到半年后生活上自给。家在本区与家庭有劳动力并可维持生活者，已出来者应送回家劳动生产，未出来的一律不准出来，如有特殊情况出来时，须经机关家委会同意及机关首长批准。家居其他解放区、蒋管区或家虽在本区但与家多年无联系也无劳力不能生活者，可送入家属工厂。家在蒋管区如敌情所迫逃来本区的干工人员之年迈父母及亲生子女，无法生活者，可由家属救济粮内予以适当补助等。
