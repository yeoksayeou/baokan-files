　　Does Stipulating Conditions for Joining the League or Association Lead to Closed-Doorism?
    (Answer to Comrade Meng Xia)
    Recently, we have received many letters from readers raising many questions about land reform, which we think is very good. Some questions were asked by several readers at the same time, which shows that they represent the thoughts and understanding of some cadres, party members, and the masses. Now we plan to answer those more common questions in a certain amount of space. We hope that everyone will continue to raise questions, but they must be written specifically and clearly. The answers here may not be entirely correct, and everyone can still raise opinions for further discussion and research.
    In places where party rectification and democratic movements have recently been launched, the New Poor Peasants' Leagues and New Farmers' Associations have been established one after another. The masses have shown great concern for their own organizations, saying, "This time, the foundation must be laid well!" It is good that the masses pay attention to the purity of their organizations, and it is also necessary to prevent landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements from infiltrating and manipulating them. However, in the process of the masses examining and rectifying the ranks, due to a lack of clear understanding of the purpose and nature of the Poor Peasants' League or the Farmers' Association, and insufficient education and control by the leadership, another deviation has occurred, that is, a few advanced and active people have proposed and stipulated excessively high conditions for joining the League or Association, such as "Four Wants and Four Don'ts" or "Four Wants and Eight Don'ts," and even nitpicking each other during the examination, indiscriminately labeling people with "hooligan" or "prostitute" and other hats, keeping farmers with slight problems out of the door, isolating the poor and hired peasants, and increasing resistance to the movement, which is all undesirable.
    It must be understood that it is inevitable that the masses initially demand "pure organizations and a solid foundation," and "strict first, then lenient" is the general law of ideological development of the masses on this issue. If the leaders are good at grasping this and use this demand to promote mutual criticism and self-criticism among peasants when joining the League or Association, and from then on establish new rural democratic living habits, it is very good. In this way, even if conditions are put forward, it will not lead to closed-doorism. However, if we fail to persuade and explain in time, and fix these excessive demands and conditions that a few active elements have started; and like them, use feudal eyes to nitpick at their own people, it will lead to detachment from the masses and form closed-doorism.
    In short, the Poor Peasants' League is a class-based mass organization of rural workers and peasants with little or no land, not a vanguard of the proletariat; the New Farmers' Association is the organization of the broad masses of working peasants themselves, not a group of a few active elements. In the process of establishing the League or Association, appropriate conditions can be put forward for mutual review and criticism to improve the political understanding and awareness of the peasants, but indiscriminate conditions with ambiguous meanings cannot be set to restrict peasants from joining their own organizations. For example, the conditions for joining the Farmers' Association proposed by the masses in Beijia, Guoxian County, are: 1. Support the liberation of the poor and support the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. 2. Be able to distinguish between inside and outside and not reflect things outside indiscriminately. 3. Be loyal and reliable and be of one heart with us peasants. 4. Work hard, and truly good-for-nothings are not wanted. Such basic conditions focusing on class and politics are worth our research and reference.

### 规定入团入会条件是否会形成关门主义？

　　规定入团入会条件是否会形成关门主义？
    （答孟夏同志）
    近来我们接到不少读者来信，对于土地改革各方面提出了许多的问题，我们认为很好。有些问题，同时有好几个读者写信来问，可见代表了一部分干部、党员、群众的思想和认识。现在我们打算以一定的篇幅来答复那些带有较普遍性的问题，希望大家有问题继续提出来，但一定要写得具体、明确。这里的答复不见得尽对，大家如有意见，也还可以再提出来讨论和研究。
    最近开展整党民主运动的地方，新贫农团新农会都先后成立，群众对自己的组织，表现了十分关切，他们说：“这次根基可得扎好！”群众这样注意自己组织的纯洁是很好的，同时为了防止地主富农坏分子钻入把持操纵也是必要的。但在群众进行审查整顿队伍的过程中，由于对贫农团或农会的目的和性质认识不清，和领导上的教育掌握不够，也发生了另外一种偏向，即由少数先进的积极的人提出与规定了过高的入团入会的条件，如“四要四不要”“四要八不要”等，甚至在审查时互相挑剔，乱给人家戴上“流氓”“破鞋”等帽子，把稍有毛病的农民关在门外，使贫雇陷于孤立，运动增加了阻力，这都是不应有的。
    必须了解群众开始要求“纯洁组织扎好根基”是必然的，“先严后宽”是群众在这一问题上思想发展的一般规律。如果领导者善于掌握，根据这种要求，推动农民在入团入会时互相批评与自我批评，从此开始建立新的农村民主生活习惯，是很好的。这样即提出条件，也不致形成关门主义。但是如果不及时说服解释，把这种少数积极分子开始的一些过高要求和条件，固定下来；和他们一样的用封建眼光挑剔自家人，那就会脱离群众形成关门主义。
    总之，贫农团是乡村工人和无地少地农民的阶级的群众组织，不是无产阶级先锋队；新农会是广大劳动农民自己的组织，不是少数积极分子的集团，在成立团或会的过程中，可以提出恰当的条件互相检讨批评，以提高农民的政治认识与觉悟，但不能不加选择乱订意义含混的条件，成为农民加入自己组织的限制。如崞县北贾群众提出的参加农会的条件：一、拥护穷人翻身，拥护共产党毛主席。二、要分出里外，不能在外面乱反映。三、忠实可靠和咱农民一条心。四、好好劳动，真正二流子不要。这样从阶级上政治上着眼的基本的条件，值得我们研究参考。
