　　Taihang Second Special District Directs All Counties
  　Strengthen Spring Plowing Leadership
    [This newspaper's report] As the Awakening of Insects has arrived, spring plowing urgently needs to begin. The Taihang Second Special District Commissioner's Office specifically instructs all counties to urgently carry out spring plowing work in conjunction with land reform. The instruction points out that the spring is early this year, and the Second Sub-district is cold and the planting is early, so it is necessary to start work as soon as possible. At present, most villages have not yet started land reform work, but the masses are waiting for equal distribution, and their understanding of the Land Law is insufficient, fearing that it will disrupt the equal distribution, delaying the delivery of manure and the repair of land, and women's spinning and weaving have also mostly stopped. At the same time, some village cadres are lying down, abandoning leadership over spring plowing production. In order to overcome this phenomenon, it is necessary to solve problems ideologically and in leadership, and to solve the specific difficulties in spring plowing. Regarding ideological issues, in villages that have not carried out supplementary adjustments, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the Land Law, explain the policies towards all strata, especially the middle peasants, during the equal distribution, and explain that although supplementary adjustments will be made in the future, it is guaranteed that whoever plants the crops will harvest them. The poor and hired peasants must also be mobilized to plant their existing distant and bad land, and not to think that they will not plant bad and distant land now because they will be allocated good and near land in the future. The poor and hired laborers have great difficulties in spring plowing, and the fruits of the cooperative and the wealth consolidation can be distributed to the poor and hired laborers first, offsetting the amount of floating wealth they will receive during future equal distribution. At the same time, investigate loans, cooperative agency production, and loans occupied by cadres. The land of landlords and rich peasants that has not yet been confiscated should be urged to be planted during spring plowing. Cadres who occupy too much land must also plant it during spring plowing. It is necessary to ensure that all land is planted, and not to leave an acre of land uncultivated.
    In terms of leadership, at present, county and district cadres are focusing their efforts on creating land reform experience, some village cadres have collapsed and are not leading production, coupled with the waiting mentality of the masses, so it is necessary to strengthen leadership. Villages that have not yet carried out equal distribution and supplementary adjustments should immediately organize a spring plowing committee, jointly organized by cadres and mass backbones elected by the masses, responsible for village-level spring plowing production. The county should immediately convene a district cadre meeting, and the district should convene a village cadre meeting to implement the organization of spring plowing. In villages that have started land reform and party rectification, the poor peasant leagues and peasant representative conferences will lead the masses in spring plowing. Regarding the various specific difficulties in spring plowing, such as the problems of livestock, farm tools, and seeds, the government, banks, state-owned stores, and agricultural and forestry bureaus should organize forces to solve the difficulties of livestock and farm tools for the poor and hired laborers. At the same time, in addition to strictly prohibiting landlords and rich peasants from transferring, dispersing, and destroying property, farmers should be allowed legitimate freedom of buying and selling, so as not to affect the market. The instructions also point out that the Second Sub-district had a generally poor harvest last autumn, and coupled with the flooding and looting by Yan Xishan's puppet regime, a serious spring famine is looming. All counties should vigorously organize production and provide disaster relief to ensure that no one starves to death.

　　太行二专指示各县
  　加强春耕领导
    【本报消息】惊蛰已到，春耕急需着手，太行二专署特指示各县结合土改紧急进行春耕工作。指示指出今年春浅，二分区地寒下种早，更须早日动手。目前多数村庄尚未开始土改工作，但群众等待平分，以及对土地法了解不够，害怕打乱平分，延迟送粪修地，妇女纺织也多停顿。同时有的村干躺倒，对春耕生产放弃领导。为了克服这种现象，必须从思想上领导上解决问题，并解决春耕中各项具体困难。关于思想问题，在未进行抽补的村庄，要大力宣传土地法，把平分中对各阶层特别是对中农的政策解释明白，说明将来虽要抽补，但保证谁种下的庄稼归谁收。对贫雇农也要动员他们把现有的远地坏地种上，不要以为将来分好地近地，现在就不种坏地远地。春耕中贫雇困难大，可先把合作社及整财中占的群众果实分给贫雇，顶他们在将来平分时得的浮财数。同时清查贷款，合作社机关生产及干部占用贷款。地主富农尚未没收征收的土地，春耕时一定要督促他们种上。干部多占土地，春耕中也得种上。一定做到全部土地下种，不荒一亩地。
    在领导方面，眼下县区干部正有重点的集中力量创造土改经验，有些村干又躺倒了不领导生产，加上群众中的等待思想，所以必须加强领导，尚未进行平分抽补村，应立即组织春耕委员会，由群众选举能领导的干部和群众骨干共同组织，负责村级春耕生产。县应立即召开区干部会议，区召开村干部会议，贯彻下去组织春耕。已开始进行土改整党的村庄，则由贫农团农代会领导群众春耕。春耕中的各种具体困难，如牲口农具种子问题，政府银行公营商店农林局组织力量，解决贫雇牲口农具困难，同时，除了地主富农转移分散破坏财产应严加禁止外，应允许农民正当的买卖自由，以免影响市场。指示内并指出二分区去秋普遍收成不好，加以阎伪水漫掠夺，严重的春荒摆在眼前，各县应用力组织生产救灾，保证不饿死一个人。
