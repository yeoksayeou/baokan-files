Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 23rd: Reports from various sources: Communist parties and people in Western European countries are rising up to oppose the "Marshall Plan" that enslaves Western Europe. The French Communist Party's Political Bureau issued a communique on the 16th, calling on "all who wish to defend peace to fight against the Brussels military alliance treaty." The communique went on to denounce the Sixteen Nations Conference and expressed the French people's anger at it. British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt delivered a speech on the 14th, resolutely opposing "aid" that is conditional on weakening the sovereignty and independence of recipient countries. The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party issued a special resolution on the 19th opposing the Brussels Treaty, the "police alliance," saying: "The Dutch people oppose being drawn into this military-political alliance. At the instigation of the United States, Dutch reactionaries have launched an offensive against communism, democracy, and the rights of the people, attempting to destroy the freedom of the Dutch people and sell the Netherlands to Wall Street." The resolution called on all working people in the Netherlands to rise up and fight the reactionaries. On the same day, a mass meeting of working people, initiated by the Dutch Communist Party, was held in Amsterdam to "resist Wall Street's offensive." Dutch Communist leader Hoekstra said in a speech: "All working people must fight against the reactionary plan to turn the Netherlands into a slave of American imperialism." The Belgian Communist Party's newspaper published an editorial attacking the "Western Bloc" as a political tool instigated by American imperialism to oppose the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: Rome Dispatch: Leaders of the Italian People's Democratic Front, in their election speeches, have been denouncing the Marshall Plan and the "Western European Bloc" as sinister traps to extort money from the Italian people and provoke a new war. Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti pointed out at a mass meeting of the People's Democratic Front in Turin: "American imperialism has frankly stated the political purpose of the Marshall Plan, admitting that the plan is a tool of American imperialist foreign policy." Longo, one of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party, said at a meeting in Inan Bari: The People's Democratic Front opposes the Marshall Plan because one of the goals of this plan is to strangle Italian industry and agriculture. Socialist Party Secretary Basso, in his speech at the provincial congress of the People's Democratic Front in Livorno, criticized "American 'aid' to Italy is by no means out of humanitarianism, but at the cost of the honor and freedom of the Italian people." Nenni, one of the leaders of the Italian Socialist Party, opposed Italy's participation in the "Western European Bloc" at a campaign rally in Milan, saying: "Participating in the 'Western European Bloc' means that once a war breaks out, Italian youth will be doomed to serve as cannon fodder for the interests of foreign imperialism, and the Po Valley (Northern Italy) will become a battlefield and a scorched earth." The Socialist Party newspaper Avanti! said with confidence: "On April 18, the Italian people will drive the dollar parties and all their henchmen out of the government."
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: Reports from various sources: The Sixteen Nations Conference, which discusses the "Marshall Plan" to enslave Europe, has become increasingly ugly due to the open invitation to West Germany to participate, according to British and French proposals. The meeting on the 16th also considered the shameless proposal of the Portuguese representative to allow Franco's Spain to participate. The Sixteen Nations Conference also decided to report on progress to its master in Washington, preparing to establish a "permanent central institution" to interfere in the internal affairs and economy of the participating countries. The conference has now entered the stage of secret meetings of the working committees. American imperialism and its agents are actively carrying out behind-the-scenes activities and external pressure. Well-informed sources in Paris said: Bevin and Sforza met on the 17th to discuss including Italy in the "Western European Bloc," and Bevin also conducted many informal talks behind the scenes in an attempt to force the Scandinavian countries to join the "Western European Bloc." The special British and French delegation, which arrived in Stockholm in February, threatened the Swedish government, saying that countries that economically participate in the "Marshall Plan" but are unwilling to "cooperate" militarily and politically will not receive any loans or materials. However, during the Swedish parliament's debate on foreign policy, most members of parliament agreed with an independent policy and were unwilling to be involved in any political group disputes.

　　西欧各国共产党号召人民
  　反对美帝奴役欧洲
    指斥马歇尔计划是挑拨新的战争
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方讯：西欧各国共产党和人民，奋起反对奴役西欧的“马歇尔计划”。法共政治局于十六日发表公报，号召“一切希望保卫和平的人，以斗争来反对布鲁塞尔军事联盟条约”。公报继痛斥十六国会议，并代表法国人民对此表示愤怒。英共总书记波立特十四日发表演说，坚决反对以削弱受援国主权与独立为政治条件的“援助”。荷共中央委员会于十九日发表特别决议反对“警察同盟”的布鲁塞尔条约说：“荷兰人民反对被卷入该军事政治联盟。由于美国的嗾使，荷兰反动派发动了反共反民主与反对人民权利的攻势，企图摧毁荷兰人民的自由和把荷兰出卖给华尔街”。决议号召荷兰一切劳动人民起来和反动派斗争。同日，由荷共发起，在阿姆斯特丹举行了“抗击华尔街攻势”的劳动人民的群众大会。荷共领袖霍查克演说称：“一切劳动人民必须与变荷兰人为美帝奴隶的反动计划作斗争”。比共机关报发表社论，抨击“西方集团”是美帝唆使而制造的反苏反人民民主国家的政治工具。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】罗马讯：意大利人民民主阵线领袖在竞选演说中，纷纷指斥马歇尔计划及“西欧集团”是向意大利人民敲诈勒索及挑拨新战争的罪恶圈套。意共总书记托格里亚蒂在都灵人民民主阵线群众大会上演说时指出：“美帝已坦白说明马歇尔计划的政治目的，承认该计划是美帝外交政策的工具。”意共领袖之一隆哥在意南巴利的会议上称：人民民主阵线反对马歇尔计划，因为这计划的目的之一，是要扼死意工农业。社会党书记巴苏在里窝那人民民主阵线全省大会上致辞，抨击“美国给意‘援助’决非出于人道，而是要以意人民的荣誉和自由为代价”。意社会党领袖之一南尼，在米兰竞选大会上，反对意大利参加“西欧集团”，他说：“参加‘西欧集团’的意思，就是一旦战争发生，意大利青年就注定要为外国帝国主义的利益来充当炮灰，而波河流域（意北）就会变成战场和一片焦土。”社会党机关报前进报充满信心地说：“四月十八日，意大利人民将要把美元政党及其一切爪牙逐出政府。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：讨论奴役欧洲之“马歇尔计划”的十六国会议，已因按照英法提议公然邀请西德参加而愈显其丑恶。十六日会议并考虑葡代表所提允许佛朗哥西班牙参加的无耻建议。十六国会议并决定向华盛顿主子报告进展情况，准备建立干涉与会各国内政与经济的“永久中央机构”。该会现进入小组工作委员会秘密会议阶段。美帝及其代理人则积极施行幕后活动与会外压力。巴黎消息灵通人士说：贝文与史佛卓于十七日会商把意大利纳入“西欧集团”之内，贝文并在幕后进行很多非正式的会谈，企图压迫斯堪的那维亚国家加入“西欧集团”。二月间抵斯托哥尔姆的英法特别代表团，向瑞典政府要胁说：经济上参加“马歇尔计划”而不愿在军事和政治上“合作”的国家，将得不到任何借款和物资。但瑞典国会辩论外交政策时，大多数议员赞同独立政策，不愿卷入任何政治集团的纠纷中。
