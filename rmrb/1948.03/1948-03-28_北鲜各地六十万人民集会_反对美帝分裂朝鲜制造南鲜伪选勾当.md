Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 26th: Pyongyang dispatch: Mass rallies were held in various parts of North Korea on the 14th to protest the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, manipulated by US imperialism, regarding its decision to hold a puppet election in South Korea and the separate establishment of a government (the South Korean puppet election is scheduled for May 9th). People from cities and villages enthusiastically participated in the meetings. In the four cities of Pyongyang, Sinuiju, Wonsan, and Hamhung alone, more than 615,000 people attended the meetings. At a mass rally of 300,000 people in Pyongyang, Labor Party leader Kim Tu-bong declared: "The decision of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea shamelessly tramples on our rights and only benefits the likes of Syngman Rhee and Kim Song-su, who sell out national interests." Protestant representative Pa Song-shu said in his speech: "We resolutely oppose US imperialism and the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea." The conference passed a resolution strongly protesting the American colonialists for using the banner of the United Nations to hire a group of Korean traitors to carry out the puppet election, infringing on Korea's unification, freedom, and independence. The resolution reiterated its support for the proposal made by the people's true friend—the Soviet Union—that all foreign troops should immediately withdraw from Korea so that the Korean people have the right to handle internal affairs without foreign interference.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 26th: Pyongyang dispatch: The Central Committee of the Democratic People's United Front of North Korea recently held a meeting to oppose US imperialism's insidious plan to split Korea. Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, revealed the US imperialist conspiracy at the meeting, stating: "The United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea's decision to hold a puppet election in South Korea and establish a separate government is the overall policy of US imperialism to split Korea economically and politically. Its purpose is to turn South Korea into a colony of US imperialism. This blatant measure by US imperialism, which violates the basic rights of the Korean people, has aroused the anger of people from all walks of life in both North and South Korea." After listing the facts of US imperialism's sabotage of the Moscow decision on the Korean issue, Kim criticized the essence of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea as being to carry out disguised activities for American colonialists in Korea. The so-called election is just a naked interference in Korea's internal affairs, electing the most vicious reactionaries in South Korea into the government so that they can serve the interests of the United States and their own personal interests through them. Kim emphasized: "We will never recognize the illegitimate puppet government hatched under the wings of this commission. We reiterate the demand of all the people, that is, to hold a nationwide democratic election in accordance with the principles of secrecy, universality, directness, and equality." In his concluding remarks, Kim called on all Korean people to rise up and stop the sinister schemes to re-enslave Korea and to fight for the unification, freedom, and independence of Korea.

　　北鲜各地六十万人民集会
  　反对美帝分裂朝鲜制造南鲜伪选勾当
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】平壤讯：北鲜各地于十四日举行大会，抗议美帝操纵下的联合国朝鲜临委会关于南鲜举行伪选及军独成立政府的决定（按南鲜伪选定五月九日举行）。各城市及乡村人民踊跃与会，仅平壤、新义州、元山、咸兴四城市，参加会议的即共达六十一万五千人以上。在平壤三十万人的群众大会上，劳工党领袖金托本宣称：朝鲜临委会的决定，无耻的蹂躏着我们的权利，仅有利于出卖民族利益的李承晚、金松苏之流。基督教新教徒代表巴荪树演说称：“我们坚决反对美帝和联合国临委会。”大会通过决议，猛烈抗议美国殖民者打着联合国的旗子，雇用了一批朝鲜卖国贼，以进行伪选勾当，侵犯朝鲜的统一、自由、和独立。决议再度提出拥护人民的真朋友——苏联——所提一切外国军队立即撤出朝鲜的建议，以便朝鲜人民有处理内政不受外力干涉之权。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】平壤讯：北鲜民主人民统一战线中央委员会，日前举行会议，反对美帝分裂朝鲜的险毒计划。北鲜临时人民委员会主席金贻荪在会上揭露美帝阴谋称：联合国朝鲜问题临时委员会决定在南鲜举行伪选，并单独成立政府，这是美帝国主义在经济上、政治上分裂朝鲜的总政策，其目的在将南鲜变为美帝的殖民地。美帝这种悍然违反朝鲜人民基本权利的措施，已激起了南北鲜各阶层人民的愤怒。金氏于历举美帝破坏莫斯科关于朝鲜问题决定的事实后，指责联合国朝鲜问题临时委员会的本质，在于替美国殖民者在朝鲜进行伪装活动，所谓选举，只是露骨的干涉朝鲜内政，将南鲜穷凶极恶的反动派选入政府，以便通过他们为美国利益和他们私人利益服务。金氏力称：我们永不承认在该委员会的翅翼下孵出的私生的走狗政府。我们重申全体人民的要求，即依秘密、普遍、直接、平等的原则，举行全国性的主主选举。金氏在结语中号召全鲜人民起来阻止再度奴役朝鲜的阴谋诡计，为朝鲜的统一、自由和独立而斗争。
