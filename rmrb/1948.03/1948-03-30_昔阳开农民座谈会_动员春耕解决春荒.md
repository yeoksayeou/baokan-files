　　【Xiyang News】In order to stabilize the public's sentiment and mobilize spring plowing, the county convened a farmers' symposium with more than seventy people from the entire county on the ninth of this month. Among them were eight old middle peasants, forty-one new middle peasants, fourteen poor peasants and hired laborers, and the rest were women. The meeting lasted for four days, and the discussions and research were roughly as follows:

　　1. Resolve ideological concerns and settle down to manage planting. Zhang Zengying from Shipen (old middle peasant) said: "The poor peasants and hired laborers in our village say that if we are going to divide the land equally, we should do it quickly so that we can manage planting; the middle peasant households say that we used to fight the landlords and rich peasants, but now the equal division is about our middle peasants." Hong Xijuan said: "Zhang Yingke in our village was a hired laborer for his whole life. He bought more than ten mu of land, and now he has married off a daughter, leaving three people. He heard in Yetou that the land was going to be divided equally, so he drove the cow to Zanhuang to sell it, but he couldn't sell it because he didn't have the procedures. Later, he exchanged one mu and eight fen of bad land for ten bundles of firewood and sold it." Wang Ziqi from Nanjiedu said: "To settle down to manage planting, whoever plants should harvest, otherwise both will be delayed, and it will be bad to just rely on the two families blindly." Then the policy toward middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants was discussed, and everyone said that they could rest assured.

　　The issue of the spring famine was also discussed. Wang Xiaoshu said: "There are more than forty households in our village, and sixteen households currently have no food. Women can't sell the cloth they weave, and the cooperative has tied up all the capital in textiles and can't turn it around. There are currently seven or eight poor peasants and hired laborers in Zhangcheng who have no food. There are many households in Lijiazhuang who have no food and are relying on going down into the kiln to make a living, earning a little to eat." Zhang Zengying said: "This year's spring famine is very serious. Relying on other things won't work. For households that have no way to cope, we can only help them squeeze out time to engage in more sideline production to make up for the famine." Zhang Guixi from Quankou said: "Households with labor can be organized to produce and make up for the losses, and we can't just rely on them." Du Fuchang from Huihuang said: "There are still thirty-odd shi of fruit grain in our village." Then each village said they had some. Kutun still had more than forty shi of fruit grain, Shipen had more than twenty shi of fruit grain, and Lujiayu had thirty shi of fruit grain. Zhang Zengying said: "Such a large amount of fruit grain can be temporarily lent to households that have no food, and it can be refunded appropriately when the land is divided in the future. If we can organize production for self-rescue, we don't need to touch it." Ling Cunrong said: "We must find good people to lend the grain to, and we can't lend it to people who eat and waste without working." It was decided that agricultural production should be the main focus, and surplus labor could be drawn to engage in various aspects of production activities. From a long-term perspective, more early-maturing crops should be planted.

　　Finally, the issue of mutual aid groups was discussed. Zhang Shulin from Min'an said: "In the past, challenging the masses was the most unsatisfactory, because the challenge restricted the masses and suffered a great loss, especially in autumn plowing. The time limit was completed, and as a result, people were digging, the cattle were idle, and how much equivalent was paid, the time away from ground freezing was still very long."

　　Zhang Zhou from Yanzhuang said: "It is not good if the livestock equivalent is too low, it must be appropriate, and to do well, it must be truly voluntary, and it cannot be organized by region as in the past." Zhang Zengying said: "Last year's letting go was that the cadres said to let go in the morning, and they went to organize in the afternoon. This is still not letting go. This year's letting go must let go of the arms, legs and feet to be truly voluntary." Ling Cunrong said: "The equivalent in the past must be cleared, and it cannot be delayed any longer. In the future, the equivalent must be properly determined." After discussion, several specific issues were raised to be resolved: 1. The existing fruit land, childless land, and public land should be temporarily distributed to poor and landless households according to the specific conditions of each locality after discussion by the workers' and peasants' association. The pits should be filled, and if there is anything inappropriate, it should be changed when the land is divided equally. 2. New migrants should be given appropriate consideration and placement. 3. Supervise landlords and rich peasants to work. 4. The stored fruit farm implements can be distributed to poor peasants who have no farm implements, and will be used to offset the fruit when the land is divided in the future. 5. The most lacking fertilizer is the poor peasants and military dependents, who can be helped to accumulate fertilizer. The methods of accumulation are to pound the bark to exchange for kang soil, fumigate fertilizer, compost fertilizer, and dig wasteland soil.

　　昔阳开农民座谈会
  　动员春耕解决春荒
    【昔阳消息】为安定群众情绪动员春耕，县里在本月九号召开了全县七十余人的农民座谈会，其中男旧中农八人，新中农四十一人，贫雇十四人，其余是妇女。会议进行了四天，讨论研究大约如下：
    一、解决思想顾虑，安心闹养种。石盆张增英（旧中农）说：“俺村贫雇说，要平分就快平分，分下咱好闹养种；中农户说，以前斗是地主富农，现在平分就是咱中农”。洪喜卷说：“俺村张英科是当了一辈子长工，买下十来亩地，现在又出嫁了一个闺女，留下三口人，他在冶头听说要平分土地，回来把牛赶到赞皇去卖，结果因没手续没卖了。后将一亩八分赖地换了十捆柴卖了。”南界都王自启说：“要安心养种，就得谁种谁收，不然两耽误闹不好，光是两家瞎依靠”。接着又讨论对中农及富裕中农的政策，大家都说这可放心了。
    又讨论春荒问题。王小树说：俺村四十多户，现有十六户没吃的，妇女们织布卖不了，合作社将本钱都压在纺织中周转不开。掌城现有七八户贫雇没吃的，李家庄现有不少户没吃啦，靠下窑来顾嘴，赚点吃点。张增英说：“今年春荒很厉害，靠其它都不行，对没办法户，只有帮助他挤出时间多干副业生产，弥补灾荒”。泉口张贵喜说：有劳力户可组织他们来生产补救，不能光依靠。回黄杜富长说：“俺村还有三十来石果实粮”。接着各村都说有，库屯还存果实粮四十多石，石盆存果实粮二十多石，路家峪存果实粮三十石。张增英说：“这样多的果实粮，可以暂借给没吃的户，等将来平分时酌情退补，如能组织生产自救就不要动”。凌存荣说：“借粮户一定要找好，不能借给大吃浪费不劳动的人”。决定以农业生产为主，可抽剩余劳力从事各方面的生产活动，从长期着眼，多种早熟庄稼。
    最后讨论互助组的问题，民安张树林说：“过去挑战群众最不满意，因挑战限制了群众，吃亏很大，特别是秋耕地，限期完成，结果人刨出来，把牛闲了，还出了多少等价，离地冻时间还很长”。
    阎庄张周说：“牲口等价太低也不行，必须订适当，要搞好非放手真正自愿，不能象过去以地区组织。”张增英说：“去年的放手是前晌干部说放手，后晌就去组织，这还是不放手，今年的放手非连胳脖腿都放开才行，要真正自愿”。凌存荣说：“过去等价要算清，不能再拖了，今后等价订分一定要搞好。”讨论后又提出解决几个具体问题：一、现存的果实地、绝户地、公地，根据各地具体情况，经过工农会讨论，暂分给无地少地的贫雇户，要照坑填，如有不适当的，平分时还要更动。二、对新移来的户，应适当照顾按置。三、督促地主富农劳动。四、存的果实农具可分给没农具的贫雇，将来平分顶果实。五、肥料最缺的是贫雇军属，可帮助积肥，积的办法捣皮换炕土、薰肥、沤肥、刨荒土。
