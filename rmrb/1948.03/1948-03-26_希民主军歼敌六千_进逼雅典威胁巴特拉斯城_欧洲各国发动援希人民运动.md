Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 24th: According to TASS, Athens, March 21st: General Markos's troops, in a battle near the capital of the Moria Peninsula a few days ago, encircled and annihilated six thousand "National Guard" troops in one fell swoop, while simultaneously pressing on Athens, Thessaloniki, and Patras. This is another brilliant victory for the Democratic Army, following the great victory in crushing the enemy's spring offensive in Epirus half a month ago. Now, the main highway from Athens to Patras, the capital of the Moria Peninsula, has been cut off, and the city of Patras is under the threat of the Democratic Army. Major General Mendas, recently appointed commander of the Moria Peninsula by the reactionary government, has also been dismissed as a result. According to a Democratic Army communique on the 21st, "Guerrillas and royalist fascist troops are fiercely fighting on the southern slopes of Mount Parnassus, 25 kilometers from the Greek capital." The Athens puppet government's headquarters also acknowledged in its March 18th communique: "Guerrillas were discovered 25 kilometers from Athens, and fighting broke out." The puppet military, police, and constabulary in Athens and Piraeus are panicked and preparing for war. Democratic Army guerrillas recently attacked the port of Thessaloniki three times in one month. According to a broadcast from Free Greece Radio: In the battle to capture Kremlia-Deskati (in the central Thessaly plain) on the 14th, General Markos's troops killed the enemy garrison commander.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 24th: Reports from various sources: The US imperialist-directed policy of bloody massacres and terror implemented by the Greek puppet government has aroused public outrage among democrats in European countries, who are launching a movement to aid the Greek people. Progressive figures in Paris recently established the "French Committee to Aid Democratic Greece," which issued an appeal stating: "The Athens government, following Washington's directives, has killed 130 patriots in the past fifteen days, and another 850 patriots are about to be killed." The committee called on the French people to rise up and stop this atrocity. On the 20th, several thousand Parisians responded to the committee's call, holding a rally to denounce this atrocity, express indignation at the arrival of the executioner Tsaldaris in Paris, and unanimously protest the French government's order to expel Greek patriotic volunteers (members of the Greek Democratic League established in France during the war), declaring that the democratic fighters of Greece and France are united. Many progressive members of the French parliament also made similar solemn statements. Representatives of various political and cultural groups in Rome formed the "Italian Committee for Greek Freedom" on the 19th. The committee's chairman, Trazini, said: "No Italian who loves the independence of his country can be indifferent to the fate of Greece." He called on the Italian people to unite with the Greek people. The Hungarian "Committee to Aid the Greek People" held a conference in Budapest at the beginning of the month, where Nikola, one of the founders of the Greek National Liberation Front, said in his speech: There are still about 40,000 Greeks suffering in prisons, and 20,000 fascist soldiers are imprisoned for anti-war activities. Nigran, chairman of the "Hungarian League of Freedom Fighters," pointed out that Truman, Attlee, and Bevin are responsible for the bloodshed in Greece.

　　希民主军歼敌六千
  　进逼雅典威胁巴特拉斯城
    欧洲各国发动援希人民运动
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据塔斯社雅典二十一日讯：马科斯将军所部，数日前在摩里亚半岛首府附近一役中，一举包围歼敌“国民警卫军”六千人，同时紧逼雅典、萨罗尼加和巴特拉斯。这是民主军继半月前在爱匹鲁斯粉碎敌军春季攻势大捷后的又一辉煌胜利。现在从雅典到摩里亚半岛首府巴特拉斯的公路干线，已被切断，巴特拉斯城处在民主军的威胁下。最近由反动政府任命为摩里亚半岛司令的门达斯少将，亦因而被撤职。另据民主军二十一日公报，“距希腊首都二十五公里的波尔纳苏斯山南麓，游击队和保皇法西斯军激战方殷”。雅典伪政府军总部十八日公报也承认：“离雅典二十五公里处发现游击队，发生战事”。雅典、比里犹斯各地伪军警宪均惊慌失措，惶恐备战。民主军的游击队最近一月曾三度袭击萨罗尼加港。又据自由希腊电台广播：马科斯将军所部十四日攻占克累尼亚——迭斯卡梯（在色萨利平原中部）战役中，击毙敌守军司令。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方讯：美帝指令希腊伪政府实行血腥屠杀的恐怖政策，已激起欧洲各国民主人士的公愤，他们正发动一个援助希腊人民的运动。巴黎进步人士最近成立了“法国援助民主希腊委员会”，该会发出呼吁书说：“雅典政府遵从华盛顿的指令，十五天来杀了一百三十个爱国分子，还有八百五十个爱国者即将被杀。”该会号召法国人民起来阻止这种暴行。二十日，好几千巴黎人响应该会的号召，举行集会，声斥此种暴行，对刽子手曹达利斯抵达巴黎，表示愤慨，并一致抗议法政府驱逐希腊爱国志士（大战中在法国成立的希腊民主联盟人士）出境的命令，宣布希腊与法国的民主战士是团结一致的。法许多进步议员，也作同样的严正表示。罗马各政治文化团体的代表于十九日组成了“意大利争取希腊自由委员会”。该会主持人特拉希尼说：“没有一个酷爱自己国家独立的意大利人，会对希腊的命运漠不关心。”他呼吁意大利人民与希腊人民团结一致。匈牙利“援助希腊人民委员会”于月初在布达佩斯举行大会，希腊民族解放阵线创始人之一尼科拉在大会上发言说：目前还有四万左右的希腊人受着牢狱的磨折，二万法西斯军士兵因反战而被监禁。“匈牙利争取自由战士联盟”主席尼格兰指出：杜鲁门、艾德礼、贝文，应对希腊的流血负责。
