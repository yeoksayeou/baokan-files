　　Dig Out 党员Bad Thoughts and Bad Work Style
  　Hexi Mobilizes the Masses to Rectify the Party
    [Our News] Hexi Village in the ninth district of Wu'an is a small village of a little over a hundred households. The Party organization was established when work was initiated in 1942. Originally, there were twenty-one 党员s, of whom five successively joined the army, two were expelled from the Party, and one moved to Tian'erzhuang. Currently, there are thirteen 党员s. Nine of them are from poor peasant backgrounds, and four are from middle peasant backgrounds. The characteristics of the Hexi Village branch are: First, the old 党员s are also the old cadres, and there have been no major changes from the beginning of the work, becoming the ruling group in the village. Second, the Party has long been at peace with itself, without self-criticism, and Party meetings are all about discussing administrative work. Third, among the main village cadres, four are non-党员s, and two non-Party cadres are people who have the final say in the village. The masses, and even most 党员s, are afraid of them, while a few bad 党员s are combined with these people, monopolizing everything in the village. Therefore, the relationship between cadres and the masses in the village is extremely bad, and the branch is divorced from the masses. Good and bad are indistinguishable within the Party, and the Party and government are not separated in the village. The masses do not know that there is a Party in the village, only fearing the cadres. The masses say: "If it is about the masses, they will be investigated to the root, if it is about the cadres, it is okay." Last spring, during the "washing face and wiping black" campaign, some of the masses made many suggestions to the cadres, and as a result, they were retaliated against. Since then, the masses no longer dared to say anything about the cadres, that is, the 党员s.
    Closing the Door to Rectify the Party
  　Little Effect
    When the Party rectification work began, several farmers' association and cadre meetings were held to explain the Land Law, the Appeal to Farmers, and the Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Sabotaging the Land Law, correcting phenomena such as cadres cutting down trees and stealing grain. After stabilizing the people's hearts, the Party rectification work was started. The work team called this stage the "closing the door to rectify the Party" period. From late January to February 18, a total of three cadre meetings and thirteen branch meetings were held.
    At the cadre meetings, neither 党员s nor non-党员s had the courage to criticize each other, and they were very worried ideologically, unable to figure out the work team's intentions, and protecting each other. Because there was no breakthrough in the cadre meetings, branch meetings were specifically convened for Party rectification. At the branch meetings, the Central Bureau's appeal to 党员s was explained, and everyone was called upon to speak their true feelings and to honestly reflect on themselves, especially explaining the ten disciplines in the appeal to 党员s, stating that those who were not honest would suffer, but there was no struggle at the first two branch meetings, and they still protected each other, collectively resisting Party rectification, and criticizing the Land Law Outline for not stipulating that landlords should be given a share, saying, "The masses in Hexi have all turned over, and they all have yields of six dan, and there is nothing left to be divided." Only branch secretary Zhang Zhengming made a self-criticism, but he did not comment on others' opinions.
    Later, the work team had a more in-depth understanding of the situation in the village, and some poor and hired peasants began to become active after class divisions. At this time, the work team gave the 党员s greater pressure, specifically pointing out the 党员s with the most serious mistakes, and only then did the Party begin to criticize and differentiate each other, and there was struggle. However, these criticized main cadres still explained more than they made self-examinations, and were unwilling to talk about the biggest and ugliest mistakes and those that were estimated to be not easily known by others, and tried their best to reduce the seriousness of their mistakes.
    Facts have proved that closing the door to rectify the Party for more than half a month took a long time, but the progress was not great, and some 党员s' minds did not move. They had one set of ideas at the meeting and another set after the meeting. For example, Zhang Yanggen once came out of the Party rectification meeting and slapped the table in a small restaurant, scolding the masses.
  　Opening the Branch to the Public Gained the Help of the Masses
  　党员s Began to Seriously Reflect on Themselves
    On February 16, a farmers' association was convened, and the list of 党员s was announced. The masses came especially early and in large numbers. The work team called on the masses to boldly make suggestions to the 党员s, and to raise any opinions on any 党员 cadres, and that this must be resolved this time, those who embezzled must compensate, those who occupied more must return, and those who offended the masses must admit their mistakes. At the same time, it warned the 党员s not to interfere in the actions of the masses, and not to have any retaliatory words or deeds. On the 18th, a mass meeting of the whole village was convened to make suggestions to the 党员 cadres; in order to make the masses dare to make suggestions, the 党员s did not participate. Many people from the masses also came. During the suggestions, three people cried bitterly, and the atmosphere of the meeting was always tense, from after breakfast until 3:00 p.m. That day was the second day of the first lunar month, and the masses did not even bother to eat lunch. Finally, thirty-two representatives were elected to participate in the branch meeting and make suggestions face to face. That day, the 党员s also automatically held a meeting all day, and no one from the work team participated. It is said that the struggle was very intense. Everyone criticized Zhang Qigui, and many 党员s also said the more serious mistakes that they had not said in the past. On the 19th, a branch meeting was convened, and the non-Party cadres who had opinions from the masses also participated. In addition to the formally attending representatives of the masses, more than ten people from the masses also came automatically. After the representatives reviewed it, they also participated in the meeting, a total of more than 40 people, of whom six or seven were women. The venue was decorated with a portrait of Chairman Mao and the Party flag. At the opening of the meeting, the chairman explained the significance of inviting representatives of the masses to the branch to make suggestions to the 党员s, and asked the representatives to make suggestions if they had any, and to guarantee that the 党员s would not dare to retaliate. It was stipulated at the meeting that the 党员s could only listen to the opinions of the masses and were not allowed to speak, and could not refute on the spot if the suggestions made by the masses were incorrect. At the same time, it was announced that the meeting would be rational and not allow fighting. The meeting lasted for six or seven hours, until after 1:00 a.m. More than 30 people spoke, and many honest people who usually did not say anything spoke. The atmosphere of the meeting was always warm. The method of making suggestions was to put forward a 党员, and everyone expressed their opinions. The people with few mistakes were nominated first. Two 党员s had no opinions from the masses, and six were given a few points and then passed. The opinions were concentrated on four 党员s and two major non-Party cadres, and eight or nine to twenty-six opinions were put forward. This meeting allowed the masses to vent their long-standing grievances, and to say whatever they wanted without any ideological concerns. The 党员 cadres were very honest at the meeting and dared not say anything. In the end, they also guaranteed to change and not retaliate. However, this meeting also had some shortcomings: First, individual cadres who stepped down took the opportunity to retaliate, spoke the most, and some opinions were completely untrue. Second, individual eloquent people had the phenomenon of manipulating the meeting, which was not corrected in time. Third, the masses wanted the criticized 党员 cadres to stand up, and did not sit down until everyone had no opinions, which was the method of fighting landlords in the past and was not suitable for such meetings. After the mass meeting made suggestions, the 党员s further reviewed themselves based on the opinions of the masses. In these meetings, it was generally achieved that everyone knew everything and said everything. The 党员s who had not been very honest in the past also felt that it was not possible not to review themselves, and changed their wait-and-see attitude to honest self-examination. For example, Zhang Qigui had the most and the most mistakes, and he also wrote notes himself, talking about them one by one at the meeting, and also reviewing many mistakes that the masses had not made or that were not known to others. At this time, five members of the poor peasant corps were invited to participate, so that they could understand the struggle within the Party and examine which 党员 had thoroughly reflected and which still needed to continue to reflect. They appeared at this meeting as masters, raising many questions to the 党员s and criticizing individual 党员s for not having thoroughly reflected. After the meeting, with the consent of the members of the poor peasant corps, five 党员s with fewer shortcomings were allowed to participate in the farmers' association. However, at this time, a very small number of people in the masses had blindly anti-党员 and anti-cadre emotions, and absolutely refused to accept 党员s and cadres to participate in the farmers' association. Individual comrades in the work team also regarded the opinions of individual masses as the opinions of the general masses, and had a tailist sentiment, and did not dare to expose and explain these incorrect opinions among the masses. But the opinions of the vast majority of the masses were correct. At the inaugural meeting of the farmers' association, voting was used to elect one 党员 as a member of the farmers' association and two as group leaders.
    At this time, the 党员s who failed to participate in the farmers' association continued to review themselves. The 党员s who had almost finished reviewing were inspired to further understand the seriousness of their mistakes and the harm to the Party. Generally, they all talked very well. When they discussed the issue of punishment, four people voluntarily requested to be placed on probation within the Party, and three requested to be given a warning. Most of them admitted their mistakes and truly lowered their heads to the masses.
    At the branch meeting on the evening of the 22nd, the members of the poor peasant corps participated, and the 党员s made further reviews. The members of the poor peasant corps believed that the reflection was acceptable, but they were not at ease and wanted to see the actions; the 党员s all expressed their attitude, not only now but also in the future they will be able to change, and they will definitely obey the supervision of the entire village. However, the masses still had a skeptical attitude towards the 党员s. For example, the members of the poor peasant corps said: "According to the mouth, it's all not bad, who knows if it can be changed or not?!" "What is said on the mouth is good, I don't know what is in the heart?" The 党员s said: "The heart, now it can't be peeled open to show the masses, if it can be peeled open to see it would be easy; look at the actions later, the heart is sincerely accepting the opinions of the masses." Branch Secretary Zhang Zhengming had a very clear position, he said: "We are the Communist Party, not the Kuomintang landlord! We say what we say, can't we change it after reviewing it? If we can't change it, we have oppressed the masses, and we should send it to the people's court." The members of the poor peasant corps had no more opinions. But the entire Party rectification process is not over yet.
  　Bits of Experience and Lessons
    In the Party rectification work, the work team has gained the following bits of experience and lessons:
    First, closing the door to rectify the Party for too long made the 党员s' thoughts stagnant, creating the illusion that "it's just like this" in the 党员s' minds.
    Second, it is necessary to break the ideological concerns of the 党员s, fully promote democracy, call on the 党员s to distinguish between good and bad, lean towards the Party, and fight against the 党员s with major mistakes. We failed to delineate the ideological front in the 党员s and carry out the struggle as early as possible when we were closing the door to rectify the Party.
    Third, the pressure from the masses must be combined with class education, constantly and repeatedly explaining the Party's Party rectification policy and determination, that 党员s must correct their mistakes, and pointing out their way out. In this way, during the Party rectification process, the 党员s felt heavy pressure on the one hand, arousing inner struggle, and on the other hand, they could gradually get closer to the Party.
    Fourth, when the work team leads the Party rectification, it should always be vigilant against right-leaning emotions, relaxation, and paralysis; but it should also pay attention to "leftist" emotions, because everyone has just come out of Party rectification to work, and "leftist" emotions are very easy to arise. We must not adopt an attitude of deep hatred towards the 党员s, giving pressure on the one hand, explaining that it is impossible not to change; on the other hand, we must also communicate ideologically, explaining the truth. On this issue, there is ideological struggle within our work team, and some comrades despise and are unwilling to do this work, and their understanding of the 党员s is tailist, and they cannot see the 党员s comprehensively from a political and class standpoint. Therefore, the work team should also frequently check its thoughts to avoid detours in its work.
    Fifth, in terms of method: At the beginning of the movement, when the masses have not risen, we must repeatedly publicize the determination of the Party rectification, support the masses, and let the masses make extensive suggestions; but once the masses have risen, we must be calm and clear-headed and study and analyze the situation more. The opinions raised by the masses to the 党员s must be proved from all aspects to be correct or incorrect, to prevent pure personal retaliation and individual bad elements from taking advantage of loopholes.

### 挖掉党员坏思想坏作风　河西发动群众整党

　　挖掉党员坏思想坏作风
  　河西发动群众整党
    【本报消息】武安九区河西村是个百十来户的小村子，四二年开辟工作便建立了党的组织。原共有二十一个党员，其中五人先后参军，两人被开除党籍，一人移居田二庄，现有十三个党员。其中九人是贫农出身，四人是中农出身。河西村支部的特点：一、老党员也就是老干部，从开辟工作到现在没有大的变动，成为村里的统治集团。二、党内长期和平共处，没有自我批评，党的会议都是讨论行政工作。三、主要村干部中有四个是非党员，有两个非党干部在村里是说一不二的人物，群众甚至大部分党员都怕他们，而少数坏党员又与这些人结合在一起，包办村里一切。因此村里干群关系极坏，支部脱离群众。党内好坏不分，村里党政不分。群众不知村里有党，只害干部的怕。群众说：“啥事情是群众就要追根，是干部就没事。”去年春天“洗脸擦黑”时，有的群众向干部提意见颇多，结果受到报复，以后群众对干部亦即对党员有意见，再也不敢吭气了。
    关门整党
  　收效不大
    整党工作开始，召开了几次农会、干部会，讲解了土地法、告农民书、破坏土地法治罪条例，纠正了干部砍树、盗买粮食等现象。安定了人心以后，即开始进行整党工作。工作组把这阶段叫做“关门整党”时期。从一月下旬到二月十八日，共开了三次干部会，十三次支部会。
    在干部会上，无论党员与非党员，都没有互相批评的勇气，思想上顾虑很大，摸不清工作组的底，互相包庇。干部会上没有突破，便专门召开支部会进行整党。支部会上，讲解了中央局告党员书，号召大家说真心话，一定要老老实实反省自己，特别解释了告党员书中的十条纪律，说明不老实就要吃亏，但头两次支部会上根本没有斗争，仍然互相包庇，集体抵制整党，反批评土地法大纲不该规定分给地主一份，说“河西群众都翻了身，都有六石来产量，土地已经没有什么可分”。只有支书张正明作了自我批评，但对别人的意见也是不说。
    以后工作组对村里各方面情况了解比较深入，一部分贫雇经过划阶级开始活动起来，这时工作组给党员以更重的压力，具体指出错误最大的党员，党内才开始互相批评和分化，有了斗争。但这些被批评的主要干部，仍是解释多于自我检讨，对大的最丑的错误和估计为旁人不易知道的仍不愿说，并竭力减轻其错误的严重性。
    事实证明，半月多来关门整党，时间拖得很长，结果进展不大，有些党员思想没动，会上是一套，会后又是一套。如张羊根有次刚散了整党会出来，便到小饭铺里拍着桌子骂群众。
  　公开支部得到群众帮助
  　党员开始认真反省自己
    二月十六日召开了农会，宣布党员名单。群众来的特别多，到的也早。工作组号召群众大胆对党员提意见，对任何党员干部有意见都要提出来，这次一定要得到解决，贪污的要赔，多占的退出，得罪了群众的要认错。同时警告党员不能干涉群众的行动，不能有任何报复的言行。十八日，召开全村群众大会向党员干部提意见；为使群众敢于提意见，党员未参加。群众到的人也很多。在提意见中，有三个群众痛哭流涕，会场情绪始终紧张，从早饭后一直开到下午三点钟。那天是正月初二，群众连上午饭也顾不上吃。最后推选了三十二个代表，准备参加支部会，当面提意见。这天，党员也自动的开了一整天会，工作组没有人参加，据说斗争很剧烈，大家批评了张启贵，许多党员把过去没有说的较严重的错误，也说出来了。十九日召开支部会，群众有意见的非党干部也参加。群众代表除正式出席的外，又自动来了十多个群众，经代表审查后也参加了会议，共四十多人，其中六七个是妇女。会场布置有毛主席像和党旗。开会时主席说明请群众代表到支部向党员提意见的意义，要求代表们有意见就提，保证党员不敢报复。会上规定党员只能听群众的意见，不准说话，群众提的不对也不能当场反驳。同时宣布会上要说理，不准打架。会开了六、七个钟头，到晚上一点多钟，卅多人发言，许多平日不吭气的老实人都讲了话，会场情绪始终热烈。提意见的方法是提出一个党员，大家发表意见，错误少的先提名，有两个党员群众无意见，有六个提了几点也就过去，意见集中在四个党员及两个非党大干部身上，提出八九条到廿六条意见。这次会上让群众发泄了长期的积愤，作到了有意见就说，思想上没顾虑。党员干部在会上都很老实，不敢吭气，最后并保证要改，不报复。但这次会也有一些缺点：一、个别下台干部乘机报复，发言最多，有些意见全非事实。二、个别能说会道的人有操纵会场的现象，未能及时纠正。三、群众要被批评的党员干部站起来，一直等到大家都无意见了才坐下，是过去斗地主的办法，不适合于这样的会议。支部大会群众提意见后，党员即根据群众意见，进一步进行检讨。在这几次会上一般的作到了知无不言，过去态度不大老实的党员，也感到不检讨不行，改变观望态度而为老实反省，如张启贵错误最大最多，自己还写了笔记，会上一条一条的谈，许多群众没有提出的或为人所不知的错误也作了检讨。这时，便邀请贫农团的五个委员来参加，使他们了解党内的斗争，审查那一个党员反省得彻底，那些还须要继续反省。他们在这次会上是以主人姿态出现的，对党员提出了许多质问，批评了个别党员反省得还不彻底。会后，取得贫农团委员的同意，让五个缺点少的党员参加农会。可是，这时群众中有极少数人产生盲目的反党员反干部情绪，绝拒接受党员、干部参加农会。工作组内部也有个别同志以个别群众的意见当成一般群众的意见，产生尾巴主义情绪，听到这种不正确的意见也不敢在群众中揭露，并进行解释。但绝大多数群众的意见是正确的。在农会成立大会上，用投票方式进行选举，一个党员当选农会委员，两个当选小组长。
    这时未能参加农会的党员继续进行检讨，已经检讨得差不多了的党员，便启发他们进一步认识自己错误的严重性和对党的危害。一般都谈得很好。在他们讨论处分问题时，有四个人自请留党察看，三个提出要求给警告处分。大多数承认自己错误，向群众真正低了头。
    二十二日晚的支部会，贫农团的委员参加，党员再作检讨，贫农团委员认为反省得可以，但不放心，要看行动；党员都表明态度，不仅现在检讨，以后一定能改，一定服从全村群众的监督。但群众对党员仍抱怀疑态度，如贫农团委员说：“依嘴说吧，都不歹，谁知道改得了改不了！？”“嘴上说得好，不知道心眼里怎样？”党员说：“心吧，现在又不能剥开来给群众看，如果能剥开来看就好办；以后看行动吧，心眼里是诚心诚意接受群众意见的。”支部书记张正明，立场很明确，他说：“咱们是共产党，又不是国民党地主！咱们说啥算啥，检讨了还能不改？改不了，压迫了群众，该送人民法庭就送人民法庭。”贫农委员才没有意见了。但全部整党过程尚未完结。
  　点滴经验教训
    在整党工作中，工作组取得了如下点滴经验教训：
    一、关门整党时间过长，使党员思想停滞不前，造成党员思想上“也不过如此”的错觉。
    二、必须打破党员思想顾虑，充分发扬民主，号召党员分清好坏，向党靠拢，与错误大的党员作斗争。我们在关门整党时，未能及早在党员中间划清思想阵线，进行斗争。
    三、群众压力一定得与阶级教育结合，不断的反复说明党的整党政策与决心，党员有错误非改不行，并指出其出路。这样，在整党过程中，党员一方面感到压力沉重，激起内心斗争，一方面能逐渐向党靠近。
    四、工作组领导整党时，应随时警惕右倾情绪，松懈麻痹；但也要注意“左”的情绪，因为大家刚经过整党出来工作，“左”的情绪极易产生。对党员不能采取深恶痛绝的态度，一方给以压力，说明不改不行；一方还要从思想上疏通，说明道理。在这个问题上，我们工作组内部思想上有斗争，有些同志轻视不愿作这一工作，对党员的认识有尾巴主义，不能从政治上、阶级立场上全面的看党员。因此工作组内也应该经常的检查思想，避免工作上走弯路。
    五、在方法上：运动初期群众未起来时，一定要反复宣传整党的决心，给群众撑腰，让群众广泛提意见；但群众一经起来，我们便一定要冷静清醒，多研究分析情况。群众对党员提出的意见，要从各方面去证明这个意见是正确的或不正确，防止单纯私人报复与个别坏分子钻空子。
