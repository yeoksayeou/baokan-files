Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Shanghai dispatches received belatedly: American imperialists openly advocate making China a colonial market for Japanese textiles. On January 31st, William Jacob, head of the American Textile Industry Survey Mission in Japan and chairman of the American Textile Manufacturers Association, arrogantly declared to the Japanese press: "The United States will assist Japan in restoring its textile industry and restoring its pre-war Asian markets and colonial markets, regardless of what obstacles this may cause to other Asian countries, the United States is determined to do so." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on January 31st, a certain "observer" in Tokyo simultaneously babbled: "American raw cotton, American capital and management, Japanese cheap labor, and the Chinese market will merge into an excellent plan." It is reported that under the nurturing of the United States, the Japanese textile industry is developing rapidly. Its production volume in 1947 has increased by 200% compared with 1946. The output of cotton yarn was 266,375,000 pounds, and cotton cloth was 661,902,000 yards, both more than double that of 1946. Raw silk production has been fixed at 10,000 bales per month, an increase of 25% compared with 1946, while rayon production has increased by 80%. In 1947, the number of spindles in operation in Japan reached 3,085,000, an increase of nearly one-sixth compared with 2,650,000 in 1946. It is estimated that it will increase to 3,720,000 in 1948. According to the level set by the United States for 1930 to 1934, Japan can have as many as 9,126,000 spindles, which is twice the current number of spindles in China. William Jacob confessed: In order to restore the Japanese textile industry, "Japan can obtain at least 70% of its raw cotton from the United States."

       美帝扶持日纺织业侵华
    【新华社陕北十六日电】上海迟到消息：美国帝国主义者公开主张使中国成为日本纺织品倾销的殖民地市场。一月三十一日在日本的美国纺织业调查团团长、美国纺织业联合会主席威廉·杰可勃向日本报界狂妄宣称：“美国将协助日本复兴其纺织工业，且恢复其战前的亚洲市场及殖民地市场，不管其他亚洲国家对此将造成何种障碍，美国志在必行”。据法新社一月三十一日东京消息，东京某一“观察家”同时狂吠：“美国的生棉，美国的资本和管理，日本的廉价劳力，加以中国的市场，将合并成为一极好的计划”。据悉：日本纺织业在美国扶育下，正急速发展，其一九四七年的生产量已较一九四六年增加百分之二百。棉纱产量为二六六、三七五、○○○磅，棉布为六六一、九○二、○○○万码，二者均较一九四六年增二倍以上；生丝的产量已固定为每月一万包，较一九四六年增加百分之二十五，人造丝产量则增加百分之八十。一九四七年日本恢复运转之纱锭已达三、○八五、○○○枚，较一九四六年二百六十五万锭，增近六分之一，一九四八年预计增为三、七二○、○○○枚。按照美国所规定的一九三○年至三四年水平，日本可拥有纱锭达九、一二六、○○○枚之多，等于目前中国纱锭数的两倍。威廉·杰可勃供认：为了恢复日本纺织业，“日本至少能从美国获得百分之七十的生棉”。
