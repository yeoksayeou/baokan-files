　　Taihang Directs Disaster Areas
　　Organize Production and Provide Relief for the Spring Famine
　　Land Reform Temporarily Suspended in Severely Affected Areas
　　[Taihang News] The Taihang Administrative Office recently issued an "Instruction on Relieving the Spring Famine and Organizing Disaster-Stricken People for Production" to the entire region, requiring all localities to strengthen leadership in production and famine relief work in disaster areas to eliminate the spring famine and ensure that no one starves and that land can be planted. The instruction first pointed out: According to the latest situation, there are still about 600,000 disaster victims in the region who cannot survive. This is not only a matter of the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, but also a serious matter concerning the region's ability to support the war and implement the land reform movement. Therefore, we specially call on leading comrades at all levels to pay the greatest attention to this and do everything possible to eliminate the threat of the spring famine. There should be no slightest sense of complacency or any irresponsible attitude. The instruction also specifically pointed out: In the spring famine relief work, oppose the "charity" approach. In border areas and hinterland areas severely affected by disasters, land reform will be temporarily suspended during the spring plowing season, and it is determined that relieving the spring famine and organizing disaster-stricken people for production are the current main tasks. Our requirement is that all localities guarantee that no one starves and that land can be planted. If the masses suffer avoidable losses due to negligence in leadership, responsibility will be investigated. Then, different approaches are proposed according to different regions as follows:
　　(1) In the hinterland, government relief should be combined with all possible self-help and mutual assistance by the masses, and relief work should be combined with local construction undertakings. This is our basic principle for relieving the spring famine in the hinterland. Such as weaving, transportation, organizing disaster victims' labor, implementing work-for-relief, such as river management, canal construction, road construction, land reclamation, etc. (2) Border areas and guerrilla areas: In these areas, implement the principle of "combining guerrilla warfare and adhering to on-the-spot production." (3) In order to effectively carry out the spring famine relief work, counties with more severe disasters and larger border areas can organize spring famine relief committees to specifically organize leadership.

　　太行指示灾区
  　组织生产救济春荒
  　灾荒严重地区暂不进行土改
    【太行消息】太行行署于日前向全区发出“救济春荒组织灾民生产”的指示，要求各地加强对灾区生产渡荒工作的领导消灭春荒，以保证不饿死人能种上地。该指示首先指出：根据最近情况，全区尚有六十万左右的灾民无法生活，这不仅是关系着几十万人民的生命问题，而且也是关系着本区支援战争的能力及贯彻土改运动的严重问题。因此特号召各级领导同志，对此应引起最大的警惕与注意，要竭尽一切可能，消灭春荒的威胁。不容有丝毫的麻痹思想与任何不负责任态度。指示中并特别指出：在春荒救济工作中，反对“恩赐”路线，边地及腹地受灾较重的地区，春耕期内，暂不进行土改，并确定以救济春荒、组织灾民生产为当前主要任务。我们的要求是各地保证不饿死人、能种上地。如因领导上的疏忽，而使群众遭受可以避免的损失时，定予追究责任。继即按不同地区提出如下的不同做法：
    （一）在腹地，政府救济与群众一切可能的自救自助要相结合，救济工作与地方建设事业相结合，这是我们在腹地救济春荒的基本方针。如纺织、运输，组织灾民劳力，实行以工代赈，如治河、修渠、筑路、垦荒等。（二）边地及游击区：在这种地区贯彻“结合游击战争，坚持就地生产”方针。（三）为了把春荒救济工作切实做好，受灾较重及边地较大的县份。可组织春荒救济委员会，专门组织领导。
