(Our newspaper, Taihang, 4th) At the end of last month, troops from the Fifth Military Sub-district actively operated in areas such as Tangyin and Huojia, eliminating seventy-four enemies. On the night of the 27th of last month, a regiment of our sub-district completely penetrated the area more than ten *li* east of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit-occupied Tangyin city, and separately surrounded the three strongholds of Qilipu, Shilipu, and Hongjiatun. After the fighting began, the enemies in Qilipu and Shilipu fled upon hearing the news. The enemies in Hongjiatun were completely annihilated by us. This time, a total of three strongholds, including Hongjiatun, were captured, killing and wounding 15 enemies, capturing 32 bandits, seizing one machine gun, 15 long and short guns, more than 40 red-tasseled spears, and 2,472 rounds of ammunition. On the 28th, our Hui County battalion crossed the Dan River and operated near Huojia city. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit security regiment in Huojia city operated in Maying (more than ten *li* directly north of Huojia city) during the day and withdrew to the city at night. After learning of this enemy pattern, we immediately ambushed two companies of troops in the village of Ximaying. The next day, the 7th company of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit security regiment, with more than 30 men, had just entered the village when they fell into the encirclement of our ambushing troops. After our fierce charge and assault, the enemies were completely annihilated. In addition to killing and wounding more than 10 people, 17 enemies, including squad leader Hua Jinhai, were captured. Two light machine guns, 17 rifles, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, 13 grenades, and 15 coats were seized. We suffered no casualties.
