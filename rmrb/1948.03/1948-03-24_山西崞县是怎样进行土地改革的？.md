This is a communication from Guoxian County, Shanxi. It illustrates that the mass struggle there has already unfolded, and the masses are fully prepared for the distribution of land. All preparations for the equal distribution of land were completed at a representative meeting of farmers. Many people were wrongly classified during the classification of class components, but this has been openly and clearly discussed and decided to be corrected by the mass representatives. The erroneous viewpoints of not providing landlords with the necessary means of livelihood, not distinguishing between landlords and rich peasants, and infringing on the interests of middle peasants were criticized. In short, the line manifested in the farmers' representative meetings in the two districts described in this communication is completely correct. At the time the author wrote this communication, Guoxian County had not yet implemented the distribution of land, so this experience is not yet complete. We hope that after the local implementation of correcting errors in the classification of classes (this is a major event), implementing the equal distribution of land, organizing production, and transforming the regime, there will be another communication describing the entire process. Regarding how to carry out party rectification in rural areas, we have the typical experience of Pingshan County in the Jin-Cha-Ji District (summarized by Comrade Liu Shaoqi). Regarding how to adjust land in old areas instead of dividing it equally (because it has already been divided equally there), we have the typical experience of Huangjiachuan in Suide County, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia District. Now there is also the experience of equal distribution of land in Guoxian County, Jin-Sui District (although incomplete). These three experiences are worth printing into a small booklet and distributing to every village cadre. This kind of booklet describing typical experiences is much more vivid and rich than the resolutions and instructions issued by our leading organs. It can enable inexperienced comrades to get started and can powerfully break through the anti-Marxist-Leninist commandism and tailism that seriously exist within the Party. Leading comrades of various central bureaus, central sub-bureaus, and front committees should pay attention to collecting and disseminating selected typical experiences after issuing resolutions or instructions on various important tasks under their leadership, so that the mass movement under their leadership can develop forward along the correct line. Now is the time when tens of millions of people are launching attacks on the feudal, comprador, and reactionary system in accordance with the direction pointed out by the Party. The leader's responsibility is not only to point out the direction of the struggle and stipulate the tasks of the struggle, but also to summarize specific experiences and quickly disseminate these experiences to the masses so that correct ones are promoted and errors are not repeated.
Mao Zedong, March 12, 1948
To Political Commissar Li and the Sub-Bureau:

I am reporting below on the situation of the recent Second Joint District Representative Meeting of the First District and the Urban District of Guoxian County:

The conference began on January 27th and lasted for five days, with 184 representatives from 32 administrative villages in the two districts, including 49 middle peasant representatives. The main issues addressed at the meeting were correcting wrongly classified components, equally distributing land, reviewing struggles and distributions, and strengthening and consolidating organizations.

The first meeting was held in late November amidst the urgent preparation for war. The meeting itself was a great success, resolving the issue of combining land reform with the struggle against the enemy, as well as important issues such as struggling against landlords and distributing other general fruits. After the meeting, not only were district guerrilla teams established and the backbone and militia forces were reorganized within three to seven days, strengthening reconnaissance, intelligence, sentry duty, martial law, and elimination of traitors, but also a vigorous mass movement was launched. Villages became involved in the struggle against landlords and the distribution of other general fruits. So far, this has lasted for two months. In these two months, the rural landscape has been renewed: landlords have been beaten down and have handed over their assets to the peasants. Poor and landless peasants have taken power in the countryside with the attitude of masters and have organized poor peasant associations, using these as the backbone to unite middle peasants, continuing to review representatives in the struggle and distribution, and further strengthening and purifying the peasant ranks. With the exception of a few backward villages such as Shangshen Village, Shangdalin, Xialian Di, and Renjiagou (all natural villages), in most other villages, poor and landless peasants have initially formed core forces in the countryside. Real mass leaders in each village have emerged from the struggle. Huang Laoer from the First District and Su Ligen from the Urban District (both landless peasants) are loved by the masses of the two districts and have been elected as the chairmen of the district peasant representative meetings and acting chairmen of the district governments. Huang Laoer has led four standing committee members of the district representative meeting to inspect work in various villages for a month. The 66-year-old old worker is even more cheerful and lively today than young people, shouting everywhere: "Smash the soy sauce jar (meaning Chiang), smash the salt mortar (meaning Yan), overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, and the poor will turn over!" Moreover, because he has poor relatives and poor friends everywhere he goes, it is convenient for him to understand the situation and deal with problems. Wherever he goes, he brings the leadership relationship with him, and representatives and masses from distant places come to him to solve problems. Work team cadres were also withdrawn at this time, leaving a total of seven people in the two districts to act as inspectors, helping peasants solve problems and assisting the representatives in their work.

Now, this representative meeting is being held in a situation where the masses in various villages are demanding the immediate equal distribution of land to prepare for this year's major production. Therefore, the timing is extremely appropriate. The issues resolved are described below:

First, solving the problem of wrongly classified components

I. Since receiving the sub-bureau's instructions on correcting wrongly classified components and uniting middle peasants, the entire county has made overall arrangements and is making resolute and thorough corrections. Preliminary inspections at this meeting show that in 33 villages (natural villages) in the First District and the Urban District, a total of 43 households of rich peasants were wrongly classified as landlords, 106 households of middle peasants were wrongly classified as rich peasants, 26 households of middle peasants were wrongly classified as landlords (Xiadalin Village), 5 households of middle peasants were wrongly classified as so-called "declining landlords" (Xiadalin Village), and 51 other households were wrongly classified as bankrupt landlords (the previous report did not include the statistics from Xiadalin Village, so the numbers were inaccurate; they have now been corrected as above). According to the inspection results of 19 villages, the scope of struggle is generally around 10% (the above is the preliminary inspection of the meeting. Except for a few particularly serious villages, we estimate that the difference from the actual situation will not be too great). Correction methods: The leadership first emphasized that in correcting components, it is not only necessary to truly correct the wrongly classified components in each village and unite middle peasants, but also to improve the ideological awareness of representatives and peasants (especially middle peasants) through correcting components, so that peasants can better understand our Party's policies. First, get the representatives to understand the ideology at the district representative meeting, and then use the leadership method of the mass line in the land distribution to cooperate and carry out the process; that is, first get the representatives and poor and landless peasants to understand the ideology, then get all the peasants to understand the ideology, then persuade those who have been wrongly classified to make them sincerely convinced, and finally formally announce the correction. The steps are: be bold, open, and correctly explain the reasons for the past mistakes, especially the benefits of correction to us peasants, the principles of correction, and the precautions that should be taken during correction, so that the Party's policies are truly understood and grasped by the masses, and the masses consciously and willingly rise up to correct themselves. I personally conducted an experiment in a nearby village with the most and most serious wrongly classified components. This step and leadership method were relatively successful. Although this village is more prominently serious than the average village, after truly understanding the masses' ideology, correction is not a major problem.

II. According to the above spirit, the discussion on the issue of correcting components at this representative meeting was conducted as follows: First, in order to study and correct errors together with the masses, so as to better understand the various thoughts, attitudes, and views of the representatives on correcting components, after the representatives were gathered, no questions were raised in advance. They were asked to read the booklet "How to Analyze Classes" in the sub-point group meetings, and the representatives' various thoughts, attitudes, and views were allowed to be fully exposed (because the representatives' thoughts, attitudes, and views reflect the thoughts, attitudes, and views of the masses in rural areas, especially the poor and landless peasants), and then disputes and quarrels (meaning brewing) were launched, and the leadership gradually enlightened and guided. After the main spirit and problems were clarified, the leadership finally solved them in a centralized manner. At the beginning, the work cadres who participated in the sub-point group were only required to correctly present the documents to the representatives and record and report the various reactions of the representatives in their original words without any omission, without emphasizing that they should make more explanations.

III. The specific development process of the meeting was as follows: After the booklet "How to Analyze Classes" was generally read in the groups, the representatives' emotions became extremely tense, some could not sleep, and some even talked in their sleep, showing various complex thoughts, attitudes, and views. At the beginning, there was a debate on the issue of "wrong" and "not wrong." For example, some said: "When we classified them, our poor and landless peasants were all present, and we discussed them family by family. There was no mistake at all. Those who were classified were all landlords and rich peasants. We didn't classify any of our middle peasants!" "The hats we put on them fit perfectly!" Some said there were mistakes, and some said there were no mistakes. Even representatives from the same village had disputes. One representative said: "There are mistakes in our village!" Another representative said: "There are no mistakes in our village!" The debate was very fierce. Some showed resistance, saying: "This method is from the South, we can't do it here; every place is different, we'll do it our way here!" However, what was universally consistent was extreme vigilance against class enemies, as they said: "Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan have not been overthrown yet. If we take out this booklet, the landlords and rich peasants will exploit the loopholes, and we won't be able to do this work!" Some said: "This booklet is ours, they can't take it away, they can't see it!" They attached great importance to this booklet (referring to the booklet "How to Analyze Classes"), saying: "We can't dare lose it when we go back!" Some expressed complaints, such as saying: "The last representative meeting asked us to drive wolves out of the flock, and now we are being asked to correct them; like a young woman carrying a dipper, she didn't catch anyone but got herself burdened!" "If this booklet had been issued two months earlier, would we have to make such a fuss!?" Some wanted to shirk responsibility, saying: "This can't be blamed on our representatives, nor on the work team, the booklet came late from above!" "It's because the poor and landless peasants are jealous, they bite when they see fat, so they classified too many!" Some were afraid, such as saying: "If they (referring to the wrongly classified middle peasants) know we made a mistake, they will smash our doors!" "We can't reveal this book, landlords and rich peasants are good at arguing, we can't outargue them!" "If those classified as bankrupt landlords find out, they will 'get angry' with us!" Others disagreed: "Don't be afraid of them 'getting angry'; if they 'get angry', we'll whip them back and say to them: 'It's not unfair to classify you as bankrupt, you've always eaten the food of exploitation!'" Some representatives buried their heads in thought, thinking very carefully, and proposed: "A few more articles should be added to this booklet!" In general, after reading the document, the representatives' thoughts were extremely confused: some said there were mistakes, some said there were no mistakes, some complained, some resisted, some shirked responsibility, and some were afraid of retaliation. Then, they repeatedly quarreled, and the leadership enlightened and guided them, starting from the peasants' own interests, so that the peasants truly realized the benefits of correcting components for all peasants, and initially got the representatives to understand the ideology. Everyone felt that there were indeed wrongly classified cases and were willing to correct them. For example, they said: "According to the actual situation, there are some that were wrongly classified"; "According to the policy, according to fairness, they should be corrected. Putting ourselves in their shoes, it's not right to classify our own people wrongly!" "We shouldn't send our own people to the wolf pack!" However, there were still concerns in their minds, and they were unwilling to correct them directly and bluntly, and were unwilling to say "soft words" (publicly admit mistakes), and wanted to gradually correct them by roundabout means. For example, they said: "If we made a mistake, we don't have to tell them. We won't change their components immediately; if they don't have enough to eat, we'll give them relief, assign them fewer errands, and take care of them when dividing land, and we'll change them unconsciously!" The main reasons are: 1. Unwilling to bow their heads, afraid of losing face. For example, they said: "We've been working for several months, and we'll get a bad name!? People will say: 'Look at those people, they must have been to the meeting in Xiadalin, they were trained, and they're here to change our components!'" Or they said: "When we go back, don't publicize this issue; it's too embarrassing for the representatives if we publicize it as soon as we get back!" 2. Afraid of landlords and rich peasants exploiting loopholes and the wrongly classified retaliating. For example, they said: "If we say we're changing, this family will want to change, that family will want to change; if you change this family and not that family, they'll still say you're protecting them!" "If we say we made a mistake, they'll want to mobilize us!" 3. But the main thing is being afraid of returning things, especially in places where things have already been distributed, saying: "The grain has been eaten, the clothes have been worn, and the white ocean has been handed over to the trade bureau, how can we return them?" "The things have already been distributed, we can't spit them out of our stomachs!" "We'll persuade them and apologize, saying that the poor are freezing; they're still taking out land, aren't they still taking out clothes?" Or they said: "If we correct their components, they'll be happy even if they don't return anything!" "No matter what, we can't return things; otherwise, how can the poor turn over!?" "Let's take care of them in future distributions, don't return them this time; anyway, they're still stronger than us now!" After further mutual debate and quarrels, and after the work cadres participating in the groups guided and enlightened them, and supported the correct opinions, they further read the supplementary draft issued by the sub-bureau on analyzing classes, and guided the representatives to specifically study and analyze how many families in each village were actually wrongly classified. After the representatives read the document, they could not immediately figure out the extent of the mistakes. After checking, they found that the problem was not as serious as they had originally thought, and the representatives' ideological emotions changed significantly. For example, they said: "I was worried a few days ago, but now I understand!" "A pond of water, one stick makes a hole - it's open!" Some said: "Doing things, doing things, there are many mistakes, are people still afraid of making mistakes? After making mistakes, studying hard again can do the work well, who can't make mistakes!?" The representatives especially emphasized the issue of middle peasants, and felt that it was the most difficult to handle. They said: "It's not afraid of rich peasants being wrongly classified as landlords, and it's not afraid of bankrupts being wrongly classified; the most important thing is to wrongly classify middle peasants as rich peasants, drive our own people into the wolf pack, and take their things, this is the most difficult to handle!" "Correcting components is mainly about the middle peasant issue. Our own people are causing trouble for our own people, so we have to work hard on this!" Some said: "The middle peasants have the right to speak, this is the most difficult to handle!" Some said: "Now that we have the booklet and the old masters, it's easy to handle! This is our method, we'll study it carefully when we get back, and it will be easy to handle when we have a clear understanding!" "This booklet is all about labor, which shows that Chairman Mao really loves us laborers!" When reading the supplementary draft of the sub-bureau, the representatives said: "The more we read, the easier it is to handle!" When studying the fourth question in the second item of the draft (i.e., regarding the transformation of landlords into other components, if they have assets, they must hand them over to the masses, and their transformed components can only be recognized after discussion and approval by the masses), some representatives said: "The few points I was thinking about have also been put forward." When studying the issue of responsibility, the work team admitted their mistakes to everyone, explaining that some components were wrongly classified in the past because our thinking was not clear. The representatives said: "This can't be blamed on the work team alone, the representatives also have responsibility, the poor and landless peasants also have responsibility, everyone has responsibility." The representatives especially emphasized: "Mistakes are everyone's mistakes, not a few people's mistakes; corrections must also be made by everyone, not by a few people." They further emphasized that personal responsibility should not be investigated during the correction, saying who proposed a certain component, so that bad people could exploit the loopholes, "We'll all be in a mess!" Everyone then quarreled about correction methods, and the opinion was: after the representatives go back, they will cooperate with the equal distribution of land, "recheck the components", and actually carry out the correction. First, discuss "understanding" among the representatives, then discuss in the poor and landless peasant groups and poor peasant associations how many families were wrongly classified, and when everyone's opinions "come together", then propose them individually, and announce them at the conference. Everyone also proposed that in the correction, first, our peasants should be more united, and everyone should be responsible; don't try to please individuals and prevent bad people from exploiting the loopholes. Second, we must correct those who were truly wrongly classified, don't "lower those who shouldn't be lowered, and raise those who shouldn't be raised, and end up in a big mess!" We must ensure that we don't wrong people, raise their components, put on hats indiscriminately, drive sheep into the wolf pack, and treat our own people as enemies; and don't lower the real landlords and rich peasants, so that wolves mix into the flock, bite our sheep, and make it impossible for the masses to turn over. Third, our representatives must be impartial and responsible. Some villages did not classify thoroughly, and there were sheltered and omitted landlords and rich peasants. This correction must also "correct" them; don't be sentimental and lose face, and turn around and make the correction incomplete.

The representatives quarreled about the following methods for various wrongly classified people:

(1) For rich peasants wrongly classified as landlords, the representatives said: "Emphasize labor to them, labor is a good thing, and don't leave labor anyway." Tell them: "Because you used to labor, we see that you are different from the landlords. We are eliminating feudal exploitation; you have feudal exploitation, so it is right to eliminate your feudal exploitation; but we have classified you too high, because you labor, we will lower your component; in the future, you must labor hard and follow the peasants." Everyone's opinion: the houses that have already been distributed can be allocated from other landlords' residences, and better houses can be allocated for them to live in. Poor and landless peasants do not need to move out. For the rest, just take care of them enough to eat. The surplus grain has already been distributed, and it doesn't need to be returned; because the year is not good this year, it can be used as an adjustment of grain for the poor and landless peasants. (Note: Grain and seeds should be returned to enable them to produce.)

(2) For those wrongly classified as bankrupt landlords, the representatives said: "Emphasize that they have exploited people in the past, some have eaten the food of exploitation, and some have played around with the future." Tell them: "Now we peasants value your labor and change your components. In the future, you must labor hard and be of one mind with us, and don't be fooled by the real landlords and rich peasants!"

(3) For those wrongly classified as middle peasants as rich peasants, the representatives said: "This is serious! We must apologize to them." Tell them: "We are one family. In such a world-shaking event, mistakes are inevitable; we were careless for a while and made some mistakes, it's easy to handle among our own people, everyone forgive us!" Then absorb them into the peasant association and return the things.

After the representatives matured their opinions in the groups on the above issues, the leadership concentrated the opinions of the representatives, systematized and improved the correct methods they came up with, and reported to everyone at the conference. Because it was a concentration of everyone's opinions, and the main issues had been clarified in the groups, the representatives said after listening: "Everything is said according to the music we quarreled about in the groups."

(4) Reasons for the wrong classification of components: mainly due to our and the cadres' unclear thinking. First, we investigated three generations and past history and classified some who had truly transformed into peasants as landlords or bankrupt landlords. Second, we classified some well-off middle peasants as rich peasants according to the number of shops. Third, we classified some middle peasants with commercial relations as rich peasants. Fourth, individual landlords wrongly classified some widowed, orphaned, and childless people who had no choice but to rent out their land as landlords. In individual villages, the problem was more serious due to impure thinking of the cadres, "left is better than right", "rather be left than right", and fear of being said to be "protecting landlords and lacking a firm stand". There are two such villages in the First District: one is Xiadalin, made by Luo Fu, a village of more than 500 households, with more than 100 landlord and rich peasant families classified. This correction found that 44 households of middle peasants were wrongly classified as rich peasants, 26 households of middle peasants were wrongly classified as landlords, 5 households of middle peasants were wrongly classified as "declining landlords", 8 households of poor peasants were wrongly classified as bankrupt landlords, and 10 households of rich peasants were wrongly classified as landlords, totaling 93 wrongly classified households. One is Dingfengzhuang, made by Guo Zixiu, a village of 260 households with 64 landlords and rich peasants classified (because Luo was a landlord component and was afraid of making mistakes himself. Guo was a local cadre and was criticized in the Three Checks movement). But in the First District, only these two villages are particularly serious and prominent. Another more common phenomenon is that work cadres use the four standards for classifying components equally to work, without analyzing and studying well according to the specific situation, and without listening enough to the opinions of the masses, thus making mistakes. In individual villages, as the representatives of Xiadalin examined, they said: "At that time, we only remembered one sentence: 'We can't protect the landlords!' We also saw some that were classified incorrectly, according to their personal labor, they didn't exploit people too much, and their future wasn't too strong; at that time, firstly, we 'didn't understand clearly', and secondly, we were afraid of being said to be protecting landlords and rich peasants, so we didn't dare to say anything!" From this, it can be seen: on the one hand, in the "leftist" emotions, the representatives and the masses did not have the courage to raise them; on the other hand, it reflects that the work cadres in the village did not take the mass line and listen to the opinions of the masses enough in classifying the components.

专栏：

      山西崞县是怎样进行土地改革的？
    这是山西崞县的一篇通讯。在这个通讯中说明了那里的群众斗争业已展开，群众对于分配土地业已完全酝酿成熟，在一个农民的代表会议上完成了平分土地的一切准备。那里对于划分阶级成份，曾经划错了许多人，但是已经公开地明确地经过群众代表的讨论，决定改正。对于不给地主以必要的生活出路，不将地主富农加以区别，侵犯中农利益等项错误观点，作了批判。总之，在这篇通讯中所描述的两个区的农民代表会议上所表现的路线，是完全正确的。在作者写这篇通讯时，崞县还没有实行分配土地，因此，这个经验还不完全。我们希望在当地实行改正划分阶级中的错误（这是一件大事，实行平分土地以及组织生产，改造政权等项工作完成以后，再有一篇描述这整个过程的通讯。关于如何在农村中进行整党工作，我们有了晋察冀区平山县的典型经验（这是刘少奇同志总结的）。关于如何在老区调剂土地而不是平分土地（因为那里已经平分了）的工作，我们有了陕甘宁区绥德县黄家川的典型经验。现在又有了晋绥区崞县这样一个平分土地的经验（虽然不完全）。这三个经验，值得印成一个小册子，发给每个乡村的工作干部。这种叙述典型经验的小册子，比我们领导机关发出的决议案和指示文件，要生动丰富得多，能够使缺乏经验的同志们得到下手的方法，能够有力地击破在党内严重地存在着的反马列主义的命令主义和尾巴主义。各中央局、中央分局及前委的领导同志们，在对自己领导的各项重要工作发出决议或指示之后，应当注意收集和传播经过选择的典型性的经验，使自己领导的群众运动按照正确的路线向前发展。现在是成千万的人民群众依照党所指出的方向向着封建的买办的反动制度展开进攻的时候，领导者的责任，就是不但指出斗争的方向，规定斗争的任务，而且必须总结具体的经验，向群众迅速传播这些经验，使正确的获得推广，错误的不致重犯。
  　　　　　　　　　　毛泽东　一九四八年三月十二日李政委并分局：
    兹将崞县一区与城区最近召开的第二届联合区代表会议的情况，报告如下：
    大会于一月二十七日开始，共五天，到两个区三十二个行政村代表一百八十四名，其中中农成份四十九名。会议主要解决改正错订成份、平分土地、检查斗争与分配、健全与巩固组织等问题。
    第一届会议，是在十一月下旬紧急备战声中召开，会议本身轰轰烈烈，解决了土改与对敌斗争结合问题，及斗地主与分配其它一般果实等重要问题。会后，不仅三天至七天内成立了区游击队及整理了基干和民兵，加强了侦察、情报、岗哨、戒严、除奸等工作，并掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，各村卷入了斗争地主及进行其它一般果实的分配，迄今整两个月。这两个月中，农村面貌一新：地主被打得灰溜溜，并且向农民交出了底财，贫雇农以主人翁姿态在农村中掌权，并且组织了贫农团，以此为骨干团结了中农，在斗争与分配中继续审查了代表，并进一步锻炼坚强和纯洁了农民队伍。除少数几个落后村庄如上申村、上大林、下连狄、任家沟（均自然村）等村外，其余大部分村庄贫雇农已在农村中初步形成核心力量，各村真正群众领袖已从斗争中涌现，一区的黄老二、城区的苏立根（均为雇农）已为两个区的群众所爱戴，均被选为区农代会主席兼代区政府主席。黄老二率领了区代会常驻委员四人到各村巡回检查工作已将一月，六十六岁的老雇工今天比年青人还愉快活泼，到处嚷着：“扎碎酱罐子（意指蒋），捣烂盐钵子（意指阎），打倒蒋介石、阎锡山，穷人大翻身！”并且由于走到各处有他穷亲戚、穷朋友，便于了解情况、处理问题，他走到哪里便把领导关系带到哪里，各村代表与群众远地走来找他解决问题。工作团干部也在此时抽走，两个区共留下七个人，作为巡视员，帮助农民解决问题及协助代表工作。
    现在这一次代表会议，是在各村群众要求立即平分土地准备今年大生产的情况下召开，故时机极为适宜。兹将所解决的问题分述如下：
　　首先解决关于错订成份的问题
    一、自接到分局关于改正错订成份及团结中农等指示后，全县作了整个布置，并作坚决彻底改正。此次会议初步检查，一区与城区三十三个村子（自然村），富农错订地主者共四十三户、中农错订富农者一百零六户、中农错订地主者二十六户（下大林村）、中农错订所谓“下降地主”者五户（下大林村），其它错订为破产地主者五十一户（前报告未将下大林村统计在内，故数字不确，现更正如上）。根据十九个村的检查结果，斗争面一般在百分之十左右（以上是大会的初步检查，除个别特殊严重的村子外，我们估计与实际情况相差不会太远）。改正办法：领导上首先强调提出，在改正成份中，不仅要在各村真正改正被错订的成份并团结中农，而且要通过改正成份去提高代表与农民的思想觉悟，从改正成份中使农民（特别是中农）对我党的政策更好的了解。先在区代会上搞通代表思想，然后在土地分配中采用群众路线的领导方法配合进行；即采用搞通代表及贫雇农思想，再搞通全体农民思想，然后说服被错订者使其心悦诚服，最后才正式宣布改正。其步骤：大胆、公开、正确解释过去错了的原因，特别是改正以后对咱农民的好处、改正的原则、改正时应注意的事项等，使党的政策真正为群众领会贯通，并由群众自觉自愿的自己起来改正。我曾亲自在就近的一个错订成份最多、最严重村庄作了试验，经过这种步骤与领导方法还较成功，虽然这村比一般村突出严重，但真正群众思想搞通之后，改正无大问题。
    二、根据上述精神，此次代表会议关于改正成份问题的讨论是这样进行的：首先，为了与群众在一起学习改正错误，以便更好的了解代表对改正成份的各种思想、态度与看法，故在代表集中后，事先不提什么问题，即在各支点小组会上念“怎样分析阶级”小册子，代表的各种思想、态度、看法，让他们尽情暴露以后（因为代表的思想、态度、看法，反映了农村中群众，特别是贫雇农的思想、态度、看法），再发动争论咯吵（酝酿的意思），领导上逐渐启发引导；主要精神与问题搞明确后，最后领导上集中解决。开始，对参加各支点小组的工作干部，只要求文件正确与代表见面，并将代表的各种反映用原话毫不遗漏地记回来汇报，不强调要他们作更多解释。
    三、会议具体发展过程是这样：在把“怎样分析阶级”小册子在各小组普遍念了以后，代表情绪极度紧张，有的睡不着，有的甚至说梦话，表现了各种复杂的思想、态度与看法。开始，在“错”与“没错”这问题上争论，如有的说：“订时咱贫雇农都在场，一家一家都讨论过，一点也没错，扣起的都是地主、富农，这没把咱中农扣起！”“戴的帽子正嵌（合适的心思），那一样也在格格里！”有的说有错，有的说没错，甚至同一个村的代表也有争论。一个代表说：“咱村就有错！”另一代表说：“咱村就没错！”争论很激烈。有的表现抗拒说：“这办法是南方的，咱这地方不能干；一个地方一个样，咱这地方就是由咱！”但，普遍一致的是对阶级敌人极为警惕，（⑴⑵）如说：“蒋介石、阎锡山还没有打倒，拿出这本本来，地主、富农钻空子，咱这工作不能干了！”有的说：“这本本是咱们的，他们就拿不去，看不到！”对这本本（指“怎样分析阶级”小册子）极重视，说：“回去可不敢丢了！”有的表现埋怨，如说：“前一次代表会叫从羊群里赶狼，这会儿又要叫改正；大闺女背斗子，没背住人家，把自己背上了！”“这本本早发两个月还用闹这！？”有的要推卸责任说：“这不能怪咱代表的错，也不能怪工作团，上面本本来得迟了！”“这是贫雇农眼红，见肥就咬，就定得多了！”有的怕，如说：“人家（指中农被错定的）知道咱们闹错了，把咱们的门也要打烂哩！”“这书不敢露，地主富农可会说理，咱们这一伙说不过人家！”“叫定错的破产地主知道了，要和咱‘恼火’哩！”也有不同意：“不怕他和咱‘恼火’；他要‘恼火’，咱一鞭把他吆喝回去，对他说：‘定你破产不亏情，你总吃过剥削饭！’”有的代表埋首考虑，想的很细，提出说：“这本本还得添上几条条！”总的看，在念了文件以后，代表思想表现极混乱：有的说有错，有的说没错，有的埋怨，有的抗拒，有的推责任，有的怕报复。接着就反复咯吵，领导上并加以启发引导，从农民的切身利益出发，使农民真正体会改正成份对全体农民的有利，初步搞通代表思想，大家觉得确有定错的，并愿意改正。如说：“按际实说，是有定错了的”；“按政策，按公心，应该改过来，将心比心，把自己人定错了，不应该！”“把自己人不该送到狼群里去！”但思想里仍有顾虑，不愿直接了当去改正，不愿说“软话”（公开承认错误），想用转湾抹角的办法逐渐改正。如说：“错就错了，咱也不要给他们说，成份也马上不给他变；没吃了咱救济他，派差少派些，分地时照顾他，不知不觉就把他变了！”主要原因是：一、不愿低头，怕丢面子。如说：“咱办了几个月工作，还落个错名！？让人家说：‘看那些人，一定是下大林开会，训了一顿，训过来了，给咱改成份呀！’”或说：“咱回去，不要张罗这问题；一回去就张罗，太不给代表张脸了！”。二、怕地富钻空子与错订者报复。如说：“一说改，这家也要改，那家也要改；你改了这家，不改那家，他还要说你包庇哩！”“说是错了，人家要发动咱呀！”。三、但最主要的是怕退东西，特别是东西已经分配的地方，说：“粮食吃了，衣服穿了，白洋交贸易局了，怎往回退？”“东西已经分了，吃进肚里去不能往回吐啦！”“咱们给他说服赔罪，说是穷人冻得不行；地还往出拿咧，衣服还不往出拿？”或说：“成份给他一改正，不退东西也就欢喜不尽了！”“东西无论如何不能退；不然，穷人还能翻个什么身！？”“在以后分配中照顾吧，这遍不要退了；反正他们到现在还是比咱们强！”又经过互相争论咯吵，领导上经过参加各组的工作干部诱导启发，并支持了正确意见，进一步念了分局所发的关于分析阶级的补充草案，并引导代表具体研究分析各村到底订错几家，代表在念文件后，一下摸不清错到什么地步，经检查后发现问题并不像原来所想的严重，代表们的思想情绪，即有显著变化。如说：“前两天可发愁哩，这下弄通了！”“一池水，一棒打个窟窿——开啦！”有的说：“作事作事，多有不是，人还能怕错哩？作错以后，再学好，才能把工作办好，谁还能没错咧！怎好的人也有一点差错！”代表们特别重视中农问题，也觉得最难办。他们说：“富农错订地主的不怕，错订破产的也不怕；为首是把中农错订了富农，把自己人赶到狼群里去，又拿了人家东西，这最难办！”“改正成份为首是中农问题，自己人闹了自己人，这得好好去作！”有的说：“人家中农有说话权利，这最难办！”有的说：“如今有了本本、有了老师傅了，好办！这就是咱们的办法，回去好好研究，有了底底就好办了！”“这本本尽说的是劳动，可见毛主席真爱咱劳动人！”在读分局补充草案时，代表说：“这越念越好办了！”念到草案第二项第四个问题时（即关于地主转化其它成份，如有底财，须向群众交出，经群众讨论通过，才能承认其所转化的成份），有的代表说：“我思谋的那几条也闹上去了”。研究到责任问题时，工作团向大家承认错误，说明过去订成份由于我们思想不明确，所以订错了一些。代表们说：“这也不能单怪工作团，咱代表也有责任，贫雇农也有责任，大家都有责任。”代表们特别强调：“错是大家的错，不是几个人的错；改，也要大家改，不能几个人去改。”更强调在改正中不能追究个人责任，说某某成份是谁提的，让坏人钻空子，“咱们都闹成一块！”大家便接着咯吵改正办法，意见是：代表回去后，配合平分土地，“复查成份”，实际进行改正。先在代表中讨论“机明”，再在贫雇农小组、贫农团研究到底错了几家，大家意见“闹到一块”时，再在农会中讨论，通过后，个别提出，大会宣布。大家又提出了在改正中，第一、要咱们农民更加团结，大家都要负责；不要个人买好，防止坏人钻空子。第二、要改正真正错订了的，不要“该下的不下，不该下的乱下，出了大糊糊！”要作到既不要冤枉人，把成份提高，乱戴帽帽，把羊赶到狼群里去，把自己人当敌人打；又不要把真正的地富降下来，弄得将狼混进羊群里来，咬了我们的羊，使敌人占了便宜，咱群众翻不了身。第三、咱们代表要铁面无私，认真负责，有的村庄订的不彻底，有包庇、遗漏了的地富，这次改正中也要“改”出来；不要惜情顾面，反过来又闹不彻底。
    代表们对各种被错订者，又咯吵下了办法：
    （一）富农错订为地主的，代表们说：“好好给他强调劳动，劳动是好东西，怎也不要离开劳动。”对他说：“因为你过去劳动，我们看你和地主不同，我们是消灭封建剥削；你有封建剥削，所以要消灭你的封建剥削，这是对的；不过把你订高了些，因为你劳动，我们才给你下成份；以后你要好好劳动，跟上农民走。”大家意见：已经分配了的房子，可另由其他地主住处，拨出较好的让他住，贫雇农不必再搬出来。其它，再照顾他够吃就行了。多余的粮食已分配了，不必再退；因今年年景不好，可作为对贫雇农粮食的调剂。（注：应退给口粮种籽，使其能够生产。）
    （二）错订破产地主的，代表们说：“强调他过去剥削过人，有的吃过剥削饭，有的踢弄了光景。”对他说：“现在我们农民念计你劳动，改你的成份，以后要好好劳动，和咱们一条心，不要上了真正地主富农的当！”
    （三）错订中农为富农的，代表们说：“这就要紧了！要好好向他赔不是。”对他说：“咱们是一家人，这么一件翻天覆地的大事，免不了有错；一时疏忽，出了些岔子，自己人好办，大家原谅！”就吸收他参加农会，并退还东西。
    以上各种问题，代表们在小组酝酿成熟后，即由领导上集中代表们的意见，把上述他们想出的正确的办法，经过系统化，并予以提高，在大会上向大家作了报告。因为是集中了大家意见，并且主要问题已在小组里搞明确，故代表听了说：“都是照咱小组里吵下的谱谱说的。”
    （四）错订成份的原因：主要是由于我们及干部思想不明确。第一、翻三代盘历史，将一些已真正转化为农民的订为地主或破产地主。第二、按铺摊摊，将一些富裕中农订为富农。第三、将一些有商业关系的中农订成富农。第四、个别地主将一些失去劳动力的鳏、寡、孤、独不得已而出租土地的错订成地主。个别村庄，由于干部思想不纯，“左比右好”，“宁左毋右”，怕说“包庇地主，立场不稳”等情绪，故问题较严重。在一区有两个这样的村子：一是罗夫作的下大林，五百余户的村子，订出地主富农一百来家。此次改正，发现中农错订富农者四十四户，中农错订地主者二十六户，中农错订“下降地主”者五户，贫农订破产地主者八户，富农订地主者十户，共错订九十三户。一是郭子秀作的定风庄，二百六十户的村庄订地富六十四户（因罗为地主成份，自己怕犯错误。郭为地方干部，在三查中受到批评）。但这样的村庄，在一区仅这两个是特别严重突出的。另外一种较普遍现象是工作干部把订成份标准四条平列起来去作，不去根据具体情况很好分析研究，并对群众意见也倾听不够，因而犯了错误。个别村如下大林代表检讨时说：“当时只记住一句话：‘不能包庇地主！’有些订的不对的也看出来些，按他个人劳动，也没太剥削过人，光景也不太强；当时，一来是‘闹不机明’，二来怕人说包庇地主、富农，所以就不敢吭气！”由此可以看出：一方面在“左”的情绪中，代表与群众没有勇气提出来；另一方面反映了该村工作干部在订成份中走群众路线与倾听群众意见是不够的。（未完待续）
