　　Rigorous Ideology Strengthens Fighting Spirit
  　Taihang Military Region Units Cadre Reorganization Concludes
    [Taihang News] The reorganization and study session for 97 cadres at the regimental level and above, as well as those in the directly subordinate organs of the Taihang Military Region, has successfully concluded after 40 days under the unified leadership of the Regional Party Committee. Significant gains were made from drawing clear lines, recognizing the essence of erroneous thinking, to finding the roots and methods of overcoming them. The ideological styles exposed revealed that 29% held landlord-rich peasant ideology, 33% held petty-bourgeois ideology, 38% held degenerated worker-peasant and hedonistic ideology, 8 had relatively serious warlord tendencies, 28 engaged in departmentalism, 26 in sectarianism, 8 were corrupt and degenerate, 8 had fatigued fighting spirit, and 13 had backward peasant consciousness. Finally, on the basis of self-awareness, after individuals proposed disciplinary actions, group discussions, two assessments by the cadre affairs group, a preliminary assessment by the presidium, re-assessment by the groups, and a final decision announced by the presidium and passed by the general assembly, 31 comrades were carefully disciplined after repeated considerations. Among them, those involved in land reform issues accounted for more than 48%. At the conclusion of the conference, Deputy Director Wang gave an ideological summary, pointing out that army cadres seriously exhibited anti-people and anti-land reform behavior during the land reform movement. Some, even from good backgrounds, married landlord's daughters and surrendered to the landlords, forgetting their origins. Some comrades expressed "wanting wives, not the Party," willing to prop up the landlords' households. Based on the essence of their thinking, they can be roughly divided into three types: the first type is the landlord-rich peasant ideology brought into the Party from their original class background, harboring personal ambitions and joining the Party and the army for opportunistic reasons; the second type is those of worker-peasant origin who have been divorced from production for too long, forgotten the suffering of their laboring class brothers, and have become politically weary and degenerated; the third type is a mixed manifestation of landlord-rich peasant ideology, petty-bourgeois ideology of small producers, and hooligan ideology.
    After summarizing and analyzing these erroneous ideas, Deputy Director Wang particularly emphasized that we must break away from individualism, strive for the purity of the entire Party, promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, raise awareness, and overcome blindness. Finally, he pointed out that the four unhealthy styles of warlordism, sectarianism, departmentalism, and bureaucracy, which are severely present in the army, must be overcome. In future work, we must humbly learn from the masses, follow the mass line, study more policies, laws, orders, and instructions, grasp principles, avoid arrogance and pessimism, and thoroughly overcome our own mistakes and shortcomings.
    [Taihang News] In order to further implement the reorganization of the ranks, the directly subordinate units of the Taihang Military Region convened a joint meeting on the 26th of last month, gathering the main responsible comrades of Party and government work from over ten units, including the departments, political departments, supply departments, health departments, training regiments, the telecommunications bureau, vocational schools, and artillery battalions, to mobilize for reorganization. After the report, group discussions were held, and it was decided to adopt a method of rotating study, putting forward the slogan "Do not leave a single cadre or soldier outside the circle of reorganization." Finally, Director Zhou of the Political Department emphasized: (1) During the reorganization, it is necessary to conduct in-depth mobilization constantly and without interruption, creating a red-hot wave of learning, based on the different characteristics of each unit directly under the military region. (2) Class education and future education must be combined. (3) We must always grasp the correct Party rectification policy and avoid going to the extreme of being "left" or right. Now, the various units directly subordinate to the military region have begun reorganizing their ranks.

　　严整思想加强斗志
  　太行军区部队干部整编结束
    【太行消息】太行军区部队团以上及军直机关干部九十七人的整编学习会，在区党委统一领导下，经过四十天的时间，刻已胜利结束。从划清界线、认清错误思想的本质，到寻找根源及克服办法之后取得了很大收获。从所暴露的思想作风来看，存在地富思想的占百分之二十九，小资产阶级思想的百分之三十三，工农蜕化及享乐思想百分之三十八，较严重的军阀主义倾向有八人，闹本位主义二十八人，宗派主义二十六人，腐化堕落的八人，斗志疲惫者八人，农民落后意识十三人。最后，在自觉的基础上，经个人提出处分、小组讨论、干事组两次评定、主席团初评，再交小组复评，最后由主席团决定宣布，大会通过，三番五复，慎重的处分了三十一个同志。其中因土改问题者占百分之四八强。大会结束时，由王副主任作思想总结。指出土改运动中，军队干部严重的存在着反人民、反土改的行为。甚至有的人出身很好，娶了地主女儿，就投降了地主，忘了本，有个别同志表示“要老婆、不要党”，情愿给地主顶门子。根据思想本质，约可分为三种类型：第一种是原地主成份带到党内来的地富思想，他们抱有个人野心、投机入党入伍。第二种是工农出身，因脱离生产过久，忘了劳动阶级弟兄的痛苦，加之政治厌倦，走向了蜕化。第三种是地富思想及小生产者的农民小资产阶级思想，以及流氓思想的混合表现。
    王副主任在总结分析了这些错误思想之后，特别强调的指出：我们必须脱开个人主义，为全党的纯洁而奋斗，发扬批评与自我批评精神，提高自觉性，克服盲目性。最后指出目前部队中严重存在的军阀主义、宗派主义、本位主义、官僚主义四种不良作风，必须克服。在今后工作中要虚心向群众学习，走群众路线，多学习政策法令命令指示，掌握原则，不骄傲、不悲观，彻底克服自己的错误和缺点。
    【太行消息】太行军区直属队，为进一步贯彻整编队伍，上月二十六日，特召集司、政、供、卫、教导团、电总局、职业学校、炮兵营等十余单位的党政工作主要负责同志，联合开会进行整编动员。报告后，即分组研究讨论，决定采取轮番学习的方法，提出了“不漏掉一个干部和战士在整编圈外”的口号。最后，政治部周主任并着重指出：（一）在整编中要根据军直各单位不同特点，经常不间断的深入动员，造成热火朝天的学习热潮。（二）阶级教育和前途教育要结合。（三）要时刻掌握正确的整党方针，不要走过“左”或过右的极端道路。现在直属队各单位，已开始整编站队。
