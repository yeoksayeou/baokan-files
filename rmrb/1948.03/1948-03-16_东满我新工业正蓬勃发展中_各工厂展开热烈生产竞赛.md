Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch: Various new industries are flourishing in the Eastern Manchuria industrial zone of the Northeast Liberated Areas. The area is extremely rich in agricultural, forestry, and mineral resources. After the Japanese invaders occupied it, they established coal mines, gold mines, lead mines, cement factories, and chemical plants. However, as the Japanese invaders' defeat became certain, they systematically destroyed everything, successively blowing up all the mines, machinery, and barracks. After August 15th, the remnants of the enemy and puppets, as well as Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, successively looted extensively, further damaging the remaining facilities. After the People's Liberation Army entered the area, the democratic government actively began restoration. Now, the area has railways extending thousands of miles, coal mines employing over ten thousand workers, forestry plants with several thousand workers, hydroelectric and thermal power plants with tens of thousands of kilowatts, iron factories with hundreds of machines, textile mills with tens of thousands of spindles, paper mills producing tons of output, and pharmaceutical factories and other chemical industries under construction. These industries, established in a wartime environment, are still quite rudimentary, but they are overcoming difficulties and developing rapidly. At the same time, since most factories use machine production and electric power, with planned organization and adjustment of technology and machinery, good production can be guaranteed. The awareness of the vast number of workers in the area is increasing daily. All factories are now launching enthusiastic production competitions and meritorious service movements, resulting in a surge in output. Taking the increased record of Hengshan Coal Mine as an example: on August 2nd last year, the daily output was 1,400 tons of coal. On the 3rd, it was 1,600 tons. On September 5th, it was 2,200 tons, and on the 19th, it increased to 2,500 tons, exceeding the output during the enemy and puppet era by several times. A large number of labor models and people's heroes have emerged in all factories during the movements, and many outstanding workers have become cadres and Communist Party members.

　　东满我新工业正蓬勃发展中
  　各工厂展开热烈生产竞赛
    【新华社东北电】东北解放区东满工业区各种新工业，正蓬勃发展。该地农、林、矿资源极为丰富，日寇侵占后，曾设立煤厂、金厂、黑铅厂、洋灰厂、化学厂等。但至日寇败局已成时，敌便作有系统的破坏，先后将所有的矿山、机器、兵营等悉数炸毁。“八一五”后，敌伪残余及蒋匪等又相继大肆抢夺，致残余设施复被破坏。解放军进入该地，民主政府即积极恢复，现该区已有延长数千里的铁路，万余员工的煤矿，几千人的林厂，十几万基罗水火发电厂，数百座机器的铁工厂，数万锭子的纺织厂，以吨计算产量的造纸厂，以及正在建设中的制药厂与其他化学工业等。这些工业由于在战争的环境中创立，还甚简陋，但均在克服困难，猛烈发展中。同时由于大多数工厂都是以机器生产，电力发动，在技术及机器上加以有计划的组织与调整后，亦能保证很好的生产。该区广大工人觉悟日益提高，各工厂现均展开热烈的生产竞赛及立功运动，产量激增。以恒山煤矿增加的纪录为例：去年八月二日（日产）产煤一千四百吨，三日即产一千六百吨，九月五日为二千二百吨，十九日则增至两千五百吨，超过敌伪时代产量数倍。各厂在运动中均涌现了大批劳动模范和人民功臣，并有不少优秀工友已成为干部和共产党员。
