Democratic Election of Village Cadres

Electing village cadres is a very important matter. To elect people who everyone is satisfied with, everyone must have a say, picking the best among the good people. The old village cadres in Zhao Village had never been completely re-elected. Although one or two people had been re-elected, the cadres and activists arranged it in advance, put on a show of holding a meeting, and asked the people to approve it. This was called "cadres passing the masses," with not a bit of democratic flavor. This election in Zhao Village is completely different from before. First, the peasant groups discussed and proposed fifteen candidates, and then all the men and women in the village held a general meeting to select seven committee members from the candidates. No one could take over, no one could sabotage, and the result was a truly heart-felt selection, making everyone happy.

　　民主选举村干部
    选举村干部，是件顶重要的事情。要选得人人满意，就要人人拿主意，好人里头挑好人。赵庄旧村干，从来没有全部改选过，虽然也曾改选过一两个人，但是干部积极分子事先布置好，装个样子开个会，叫老百姓通过。这叫做“干部通群众过”，没有一点民主气味。这次赵庄选举，和以前完全不一样，先由农民小组讨论提出十五个候选人，然后全村男女开大会再从候选人里挑选七个委员，谁也不能包办，谁也不能捣鬼，结果选得真碰心事，人人高兴。
