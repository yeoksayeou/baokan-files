　　The New Masses Daily is Easy to Understand Through Listening and Reading;
  　Circulation Reaches 35,000 Copies
    [Our Dispatch] The New Masses Daily, a popular newspaper in this region, has been embraced by a wide readership since its publication two months ago, with circulation soaring. The ninth issue reached 35,000 copies, ranking first among all newspapers in the region. The person in charge of the newspaper shared the following experiences gained over the past two months:

    I. Preliminary Implementation of the Guiding Principles Set by the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department: In the past, the New Masses was a magazine, published once or twice a month, with content mainly focused on the Self-Defense War and Land Reform. It also included articles written by worker and peasant comrades. However, because stories took up a large portion of the content, and needed to be written with a beginning and an end, and the time between publication and distribution was long, it limited its connection with the broad masses and its integration with work. During the Land Conference, in order to further integrate this magazine, which had a certain mass base, with the masses, the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department decided to change it into a popular newspaper. The general guiding principle was to serve Land Reform and the Self-Defense War. There were two approaches: one was to publicize and explain the Central Committee's and Central Bureau's guidelines and instructions on filling gaps, Party rectification, and the democratic movement, making them understandable to the masses. The other was to discover and solve ideological and practical problems of the masses in the movement. Although the newspaper's trial operation for over two months cannot be said to have fully implemented the Propaganda Department's guiding principles, it has gained many readers among the masses and district and village cadres due to this preliminary effort. For example, at the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee's Propaganda and Liaison Conference, several counties mentioned that the New Masses Daily was suitable for the learning and needs of district and village cadres, and they hoped to order more copies to be distributed to the villages. Minister Wang also asked: Can they really understand it? Comrades from eleven counties unanimously replied: They can understand it; those who cannot read it can understand it by listening. Comrade Xing Linkui, the district chief of Wu'an Chengguan District, used to have difficulty understanding many issues when reading newspapers, but now he understands everything when he reads the New Masses. According to feedback from the masses in various places, they also believe that the content after the newspaper's change is more suitable for their needs. As a result, the newspaper's circulation has increased from 8,000 copies when it was a monthly magazine to the current 35,000 copies, and the distribution area has also expanded: including 41 counties in the Taihang Region, 36 counties in the Taiyue Region, 19 counties in the Jiluyu Region, and 36 counties in the Jinnan Region; the New Masses Daily can be found as far west as Yishi and Wanquan, as far north as Shizhuang and Pingding, as far east as Gaotang and Shouchang, and as far south as Chengwu and Huojia.

    II. Editing, Communication, and Distribution Must Be Combined: Because the newspaper is small, the organization must be flexible. The newspaper believes that in order to popularize the newspaper, in addition to striving to implement the guiding principles set by the Propaganda Department, it is necessary to do its best to combine editing, communication, and distribution, so that readers gradually become writers; writers are also propagandists and organizers, publicizing the materials in the New Masses, organizing the masses to subscribe, write articles, read together, and write together, so that the newspaper can be popularized. For example, the postal workers of the post office are the distributors of the New Masses, and at the same time, they are readers, writers, and promoters of the New Masses; the people of the newspaper are writers, but when they go to the villages, they help with the work, explain documents such as the Outline Land Law to the masses, and introduce the newspaper (for example, writer Zhao Shuli compiled one edition of the newspaper while participating in the land reform work in the village). They are now planning to allocate the literary and art award funds issued by the Propaganda Department last year to mobilize readers to write articles, raise questions, and provide information.

    III. Learning from the Masses and Educating the Masses: This is in terms of the internal work of the newspaper. For example, the manuscripts from the readers are originally very simple, and if you insist on revising them, they will become the editor's tone; but some manuscripts are verbose and cumbersome, and they must be refined, because popularization is not about having a lot of slang or nonsense. It is necessary to select the center from the manuscripts and cherish the readers' manuscripts; but there must also be a certain guiding principle and plan, and it is necessary to remove some of the readers' manuscripts.

    The person in charge of the newspaper finally said: The New Masses Daily directly meets with the masses and district and village cadres. The more copies are distributed, the greater the responsibility. They feel that they are not up to the task and hope that the Party committees leading land reform in various places, the comrades participating in land reform, and the masses in various places can give more instructions and help.

### 新大众报听看都能懂　已经发到三万五千份

　　新大众报听看都能懂
  　已经发到三万五千份
    【本报消息】本区通俗报纸新大众报，出版两个月来，得到广大读者拥护，销数激增。第九期发行即达三万五千份。占全区报纸销数的第一位。该报负责人介绍了两个多月来的点滴经验如下：
    一、初步执行了中央局宣传部规定的方针：过去新大众是个杂志，一月或半月出一回，内容曾以自卫战争、土地改革为主，也有工农同志写稿，但因故事占的篇幅多，又要写得有头有尾，出版同发行的时间又长，便限制了与广大群众结合，也限制了与工作结合。土地会议期间，中央局宣传部为了使这个有些群众基础的杂志，进一步结合群众，决定改成通俗报纸，总的方针是服务土地改革、自卫战争，做法有两个，一个是把中央、中央局有关填补、整党与民主运动的方针、指示，宣传解释，做到群众都能看能懂。一个是把运动中群众思想上的问题，与具体的问题，发现出来，加以解决。该报经过两个多月的试办，虽还不能说把宣传部这一方针已执行得很够的，但因初步这样做了，在群众与区村干部中，便获得不少读者。例如：冀南三地委宣联会上，好几个县都提到，新大众报适合区村干部的学习同需要，希望能多订些发到各村。王部长还问：是否真能看得懂？十一个县的同志一致回答：能看懂，不能看懂的也能听懂。武安城关区区长邢林魁同志，过去看报很多问题懂不下，现在看新大众就全懂了。根据各地群众反映，也认为：改报后内容还适合他的需要。由于这样，该报在发行上，遂由过去月刊时的八千份，增加到现时的三万五千份，发行地区也扩大了：计太行区四十一个县，太岳区三十六个县，冀鲁豫区十九个县，冀南区三十六个县；西至猗氏、万泉，北到石庄、平定，东至高唐、寿张，南至城武、获嘉，都有新大众报的踪迹。
    二、编辑、通联、发行要结合来做。报小，机构就要灵活。该报考虑到报纸要群众化，除了努力执行宣传部规定的方针，在编辑、通联、发行上，就要尽力做到互相结合，使读者逐渐变做写稿的人；写稿的人，又是宣传者与组织者，宣传新大众上的材料，组织群众订阅、写稿、大家看、大家写，报纸才能群众化。比如：邮局的邮工同志，是新大众的发行者，同时他又是读者、写稿人、新大众的推销员；报社的人是写稿的，但到村里后，便帮助工作，给群众讲解土地法大纲等文件，介绍报纸（例如作家赵树理同志，编一版报，同时参加驻村土地改革工作）。现在正拟拨用宣传部去年所发文艺奖金，发动读者来写稿、提问题，供给情况。
    三、向群众学习与教育群众。这是就报纸内部工作来说的。如：读者来的稿子，原来就很朴素，硬去修改，就成了编者的一个调子；但有些稿子罗嗦累赘，一定又要精炼，因为，通俗化不是土话多，也不是废话多。要从来稿里选中心，珍惜读者的稿子；但又要有一定的方针同计划，不惜去掉一些读者的稿子。
    该报负责人最后谈：新大众报是直接同群众和区村干部见面的，发行份数越多责任越大，他们深感力不胜任，希望各地领导土地改革的党委，与参加土地改革的同志，和各地群众，能多指示与帮助。
