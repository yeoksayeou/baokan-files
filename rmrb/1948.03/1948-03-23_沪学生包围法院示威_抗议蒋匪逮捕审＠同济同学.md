Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Shanghai News: When the Chiang bandit Shanghai District Court fabricated charges to try arrested Tongji University students on the 15th, more than three thousand students from various Shanghai schools surrounded the Chiang bandit District Court in protest. The arrested Tongji University students Huang Kelu, Pan Shuibang, Qu Shouping and others righteously denounced the Chiang bandits for creating the Tongji massacre in court, and unanimously denied that they had beaten the Chiang bandit Mayor Wu Guozhen. During the trial, more than three thousand students outside the court sang songs, shouted slogans, condemned the Chiang bandits' crimes of persecuting students, and demanded the immediate release of the students on trial. Since the Chiang bandits created the Tongji University massacre on January 29, more than 200 students from various schools in Shanghai have been expelled, and Huang Kelu and others have been imprisoned for a month and a half.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: According to the US Imperialist Associated Press, Chiang Kai-shek is using Shanghai as a center to engage in the opium trade and reap huge profits. The Associated Press claimed: "China's three major opium producing areas are showering Shanghai with finished products, and are being sold in Shanghai at prices calculated by weight in gold. 'Showering' - this is an accurate adjective for the large-scale secret transportation that is underway, because most of the drugs are transported by air. The three major opium producing areas are as follows: western Yunnan, parts of Jehol (referring to Chiang-occupied areas), and western Sichuan and Xikang."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Han Yonghan, the son of Han Zengdong, the former Chiang army 71st Army 88th Division Commander who died for the Chiang bandits in Sipingjie last July, committed suicide because he could not make a living. Han Yonghan was fifteen years old and studying at Huiwen Middle School in Beiping. Because the Chiang bandits had long withheld "consolation money" (referring to the money for which Han Zengdong sold his life), he committed suicide with a pistol in Beiping on the 18th of last month. His mother, Cao Lanfang, published an advertisement in the Tianjin newspaper on the 13th, begging Chen Mingren, the former commander of the Chiang bandit 71st Army, for "consolation money," stating: "The consolation money for the late Commander Han Zengdong was received during your term as general (referring to the bandit Chen Mingren). I am not sure how this consolation money was handled, and I am very confused. If the general is keeping it for us, it has been more than half a year. Although we are orphans and widows, we can still manage it ourselves and dare not presumptuously overstep our bounds." But to no avail, Han Yonghan committed suicide five days after this notice was published.

    沪学生包围法院示威
  　抗议蒋匪逮捕审＠同济同学
    【新华社陕北十七日电】沪讯：当蒋匪上海地方法院虚构罪名于十五日审讯被捕的同济大学学生时，沪各校学生三千余包围着蒋匪地方法院示威。被捕的同济大学学生黄克鲁、潘水邦、瞿守平等十一人在法庭上理直气壮的痛斥蒋匪制造同济血案，并一致否认曾殴打蒋匪市长吴国桢。审讯时，法院外三千余学生唱歌、喊口号，声讨蒋匪迫害学生罪行，并要求立即释放被审讯的同学。按自一月二十九日蒋匪制造同济大学血案以来，沪市各校学生已有二百余人横遭开除，而黄克鲁等被监禁已达一个半月。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据美帝合众社透露：蒋介石正以上海为中心，大做贩卖鸦片生意，牟取厚利。合众社供称：“中国的三大鸦片出产地区阵雨般地以制成品供应上海，并正在上海按重量以黄金计算价格售卖。‘阵雨般地’——这是对在进行中的大规模秘密运输的确切的形容词，因为该项毒品大部分都是用飞机运来的。三大鸦片出产地区如下：云南西部、热河部分地区（按指蒋占区）以及包括川西和西康的华西”。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】去年七月间在四平街为蒋匪卖命而死的前蒋军七十一军八十八师师长韩增栋之子韩泳涵因无法生活而自杀。韩泳涵年十五岁，在北平汇文中学读书，因蒋匪久久扣压“恤金”（按即韩增栋卖命的钱），而于上月十八日在北平以手枪自杀。其母曹兰芳于十三日曾在津市报纸刊登启事，向蒋匪前七十一军军长陈明仁哀求“恤金”，内称：“韩故师长增栋之恤金，已于将军（指陈匪明仁）任期内领讫，未悉此项恤金作何处理，极感困惑。如系将军代为保存，则为时半载有余，我等虽属孤儿寡妇，尚能自行保管不敢冒昧尊驾，越俎代庖也”。但毫无结果，韩泳涵即在此书刊出后五日自杀。
