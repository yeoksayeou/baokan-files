　　Take Action to Support the Land Law
　　New Rich Peasant Wu Manyou Donates Surplus Property
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th】 Wu Manyou, a famous labor hero from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region who participated in the army, after studying the Outline Land Law of China and Chairman Mao's December report, decided to donate all his surplus land, grain, and livestock to farmers who lacked these things. On February 8, Wu Manyou sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Chairman Lin of the Border Region Government, and Secretary Xi of the Northwest Central Bureau of the CCP, stating: "In my studies, I fully support the Outline Land Law and Chairman Mao's report. In the Three Check-ups Movement of checking class, checking stand, and checking fighting spirit, I reflected on my past attitude towards hired laborers and refugees, and I was wrong. After the Hu Zongnan bandit gang looted and burned the Border Region, the disaster situation is serious. I am willing to give my more than fifty stone of surplus grain, four cattle, and forty sheep, except for leaving a pair of cattle, ten sheep, and the necessary food for my family, all to the government for distribution to relieve the disaster victims. My land will be handed over to the farmers' association for equal distribution after Yan'an is recovered. I have suffered the deepest from feudal oppression. From now on, I am determined to study Chairman Mao's thought of saving the poor people of the world, join the army to participate in combat and land reform, and work as a long-term worker for the people." According to reports, Wu Manyou was originally a penniless refugee before the land revolution in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1934. He was allocated land during the land reform. After seven or eight years of hard work, plus new reclamation and the recruitment of hired laborers, he has become a new-style rich peasant with surplus land, grain, and livestock. In this land reform, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region decided to treat the new-style rich peasants who grew up due to the equal distribution of land during the First Civil War, and the new-style rich peasants who grew up due to rent reduction and interest rate reduction during the War of Resistance Against Japan, as middle peasants. Their surplus land will only be extracted and adjusted to farmers without or with little land with their consent, and their surplus property will be kept intact. Because Wu Manyou was educated by the democratic government, the People's Liberation Army, and the Communist Party, his political consciousness has gradually improved, and he has been promoted from the level of a new-style rich peasant and ordinary labor hero to the level of a People's Liberation Army soldier and a Communist Party member. Therefore, he is determined to donate all the surplus land, grain, and livestock except for what is necessary for his family according to the general peasant standard.

　　拿行动来拥护土地法
  　新富农吴满有献出多余财产
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】陕廿宁边区参加军队的著名劳动英雄吴满有，在学习中国土地法大纲和毛主席十二月报告以后，决心将自己的多余土地粮食牲畜，全部献给缺少这些东西的农民。吴满有在二月八日致电毛主席和边区政府林主席、中共西北中央局习书记称：“我在学习中完全拥护土地法大纲和毛主席报告，在查阶级查立场查斗志的三查运动中，我反省了过去在对待雇工和难民的态度上，我是有错误的。边区在胡宗南匪帮抢掠烧杀以后，灾情严重，我愿将我的五十多石余粮，四头牛，四十只羊，除留给家庭人口一对牛十只羊和必要的吃粮外，全部送给政府，分配救济灾民。我的土地待延安收复后，交农会平分。我受封建压迫最深，今后决心学习毛主席救活天下穷人的思想，随军参加作战和土地改革，为人民作长工”。按吴满有在一九三四年陕甘宁边区土地革命以前，原是一无所有的难民，在土地改革中分得土地，经过七八年的努力劳动，加上新开荒地和招收雇工的结果，已经成了有多余土地粮食牲畜的新式富农。陕甘宁边区在这一次土地改革中，决定对于在第一次内战时期因平分土地而生长起来的新式富农，和在抗日战争时期因减租减息而生长起来的新式富农，按照中农待遇，他们的多余土地，在他们本人同意下，才抽出调剂给无地少地的农民，他们的多余财产则一律保留不动。吴满有因受民主政府人民解放军和共产党的教育，其政治觉悟逐渐提高，已由新式富农和普通劳动英雄的水平，提高到人民解放军战士和共产党员的水平，所以他决心除留下自己家庭人口按一般农民标准所必需者以外，献出全部多余的土地粮食和牲畜。
