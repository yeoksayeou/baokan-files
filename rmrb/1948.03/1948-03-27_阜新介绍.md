　　Introduction to Fuxin

　　Fuxin City consists of four parts: West Fuxin, Fuxin, East Fuxin, and Xinqiu. It is located 180 li north of Yixian County and is a well-known coal production center. The Xin (Lidun) - Yi (County) railway line runs through the center of the city. The population reaches more than 180,000, and the number of coal mine workers exceeds 10,000. The Fuxin Coal Mine spans between Fuxin and Yixian, extending from Xinqiu to Qinghemen, with a length of 70 kilometers and a width of 8 to 20 kilometers. There are coal mining sites such as Sunjiawan, Xinqiu, Taiping, Wulong, Gaode, and Chengnan. The total reserves in the Fuxin coal mining area are 4 billion tons. The output in 1941 was more than 4 million tons. The coal quality is very similar to that of Fushun coal and can be used for the production of synthetic petroleum and is also of great significance in the oil shale melting industry. The Japanese invaders, based on their so-called "overproduction plan of the industrial five-year plan," increased investment from 40 million yuan to 90 million yuan. Modern machines are generally installed in various coal mining sites, such as 120 kW mine shovels, 300-horsepower electric hoists, and 85-ton electric locomotives, and a 7,000 kW generator is also installed. In 1939, a large oil vein was discovered in Dongliang, west of the city, breaking the conclusion that there was no oil in Northeast China.

　　阜新介绍
    阜新市系由西阜新、阜新、东阜新、新邱等四个部分组成，位于义县北一百八十里，为著名产煤中心。新（立屯）义（县）线横贯于市之中央。人口达十八万余，煤矿职工达万余人。阜新煤矿横跨阜新及义县之间，绵延于新邱至清河门一带，长达七十公里，宽八公里至二十公里。有孙家湾、新邱、太平、五龙、高德、城南等采煤所，总计阜新煤矿区埋藏量为四十亿吨。一九四一年之产量即在四百万吨以上。该炭质与抚顺炭极为相似，可供制人造石油之用，并在石煤溶化工业方面亦有重要意义。日寇曾根据其所谓“产业五年计划的超产计划”，投资由四千万元增至九千万元，各采煤所普遍设有现代机器，如一二○千瓦矿锹、三○○马力的电气卷扬机、八十五吨的电气机车等，并设有七千千瓦之发电机一台。一九三九年又在该市西方之东梁发见一大油脉，打破了东北无石油之定论。
