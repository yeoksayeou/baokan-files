Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: Reports from various sources: European democratic public opinion unanimously condemns Truman's speech. The French Communist Party's "l'Humanité" commented on the 18th that: "Mr. Truman's speech coincided with the signing of the Brussels Pact, which is no coincidence." The "Western European Bloc" is the "Atlantic Bloc," and the U.S. State Department regards the member states of the "Western European Bloc" as its satellite states, wanting them to completely submit. The newspaper powerfully concluded: "The nations will assure the schemers in Brussels, with resolute and calm action, that what they signed yesterday is nothing more than a piece of waste paper, and we are stronger than you." The Italian Socialist Party's "Avanti!" said: Italian democrats reject Truman's interference. The Italian people have the strong power to defend their national independence. The Italian People's Democratic Front has the support of the entire people, who will cast millions of votes for it and remove the Gasperi government that serves foreign powers. "La Repubblica" said: Anglo-American imperialists attempt to influence the future of the Italian elections, but they forget that the more base and bankrupt their blackmail, the stronger the Italian people's determination to fight for their rights. The Hungarian Communist Party's organ said: Truman's speech is "just a cheap election trick." "Truman wants to use war to scare dissatisfied masses and shut up Wallace's opposition party." The Czech News Agency pointed out that Truman's accusation that the demobilizing Soviet Union has failed to cooperate in seeking peace is deceitful.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: Washington Dispatch: As the American economic crisis looms, U.S. President Truman delivered an arrogant speech to the U.S. Congress on the 17th. He repeated the platitudes of American warlords and bankers, falsely claiming that "the Soviet Union and its agents have destroyed the independent democracies of Central and Eastern European countries, creating the current European crisis." He was filled with fear over the growth of the power of the European people, ranting that "the fall of Czechoslovakia has put the entire world civilization to the test, the Scandinavian countries are uneasy, Greece is under attack by rebels, and the Italian Communist Party is trying to control the country." Under this pretext, Truman immediately revealed his aggressive nature, declaring "full support" for the "Fifty-Year Economic Cooperation and Joint Defense Treaty" signed by his Western European lackeys on the 17th, attempting to use this treaty to turn Western European countries into American appendages or colonies. To achieve this goal, Truman barked that "the United States must maintain a strong military force" to support European countries "threatened by communists and totalitarian states," demanding that the U.S. Congress take what he calls "adventurous" actions: (1) Rapidly pass the aid-to-Europe plan; (2) Rapidly formulate a universal military training bill; (3) Temporarily reinstate the conscription law before the universal military training law is established.

     杜鲁门作狂妄反共叫嚣
   　欧洲舆论斥为卑鄙的讹诈
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：欧洲民主舆论一致痛斥杜鲁门演说。法共人道报十八日评称：杜氏演说恰与布鲁塞尔条件签订同时，这不是偶然的。“西欧集团”就是“大西洋集团”，美国务院把“西欧集团”的会员国看作它的卫星国，想要他们完全屈服。该报有力的结语说：“各国将以坚决而镇定的行动，向布鲁赛尔的阴谋家保证说：他们昨天所签订的，不过是一张废纸，我们比你们更强大。”意大利社会党前进报说：意民主人士拒绝杜鲁门的干涉，意大利人民有强大的力量保卫其国家的独立，意大利人民民主阵线获有全体人民的拥护，他们将投给它成百万张选票，并将把为外国服务的加斯贝利政府革职。共和报说：英美帝国主义者企图影响意国选举的前途，但他们忘记了，他们的讹诈愈卑鄙愈破产，意国人民为其权利而斗争的决心也愈坚强。匈牙利共产党机关报说：杜的演说：“只是廉价的竞选伎俩”，“杜鲁门想用战争来吓唬心怀不满的群众，封住华莱士反对党的嘴”。捷克通讯社指出：杜鲁门指责正在复员的苏联未能合作共谋和平，乃是欺人之谈。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】华盛顿讯：当美国经济危机日见迫近之际，美总统杜鲁门，十七日向美国国会发表狂妄演说。他重复了美国军阀银行家的滥调，诬称“苏联及其代理人摧毁了中欧东欧国家的独立民主，造成今日欧洲危局”。他对欧洲人民力量的壮大充满恐惧，胡说什么“捷克的沦亡使整个世界文明受到考验，斯堪的那维亚国家惶惶不安，希腊处于叛军的袭击下，义大利共产党正力图控制这个国家”。杜鲁门继即在此种借口下，露出其侵略的原形，对其西欧走卒受命于十七日签订的“五十年经济合作与共同防御条约”，宣布作“全力支持”，企图借此条约把西欧各国变成美国的附庸国或殖民地。为达到此目的，杜氏狂吠“美国必须维持强大的武力”以支持所谓“遭受共产党及极权国家威胁”的欧洲各国，要求美国会作他自称“冒险性”的如下行动：（一）迅速通过援欧计划；（二）迅速制定普遍军训法案；（三）在普遍军训法未成立前，暂时恢复征兵法。
