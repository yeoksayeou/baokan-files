According to the Czech Communist Party's newspaper *Rudé právo*, the CCP added 55,874 new members in February, and now has 1,412,000 members. Since defeating the reactionaries, the prestige of the CCP has greatly increased. In recent days, thousands of people have joined the party every day. At present, the CCP convened a meeting of senior cadres. At the meeting, General Secretary Slánský, while praising the great victory of the democratic forces in the recent events, explained: "When the reactionaries launched an offensive, the Communist Party took the initiative, relying on the support of the working people, to defeat the offensive of the reactionaries, who attempted to split the National Front and split the alliance of all working people in urban and rural areas. However, they were crushed; the National Front remains intact." Regarding the National Front, Slánský pointed out: "It is now the most representative institution in the republic, and it symbolizes the unity of all the people. The National Front and the Action Committee will make decisions on major issues concerning politics and the people's lives. The National Front will be the organizer of the Czech people's constructive activities. It will consolidate the spiritual unity of the people and cleanse traitors from all organizations."
