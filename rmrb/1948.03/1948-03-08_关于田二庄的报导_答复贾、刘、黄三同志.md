　　Report on Tian Er Zhuang
  　Reply to Comrades Jia, Liu, and Huang
    To the Editors:
    Having read the valuable opinions raised by Comrades Jia, Liu, and Huang on March 4 regarding the report on the work in Tian Er Zhuang, besides the scattered materials from a separate draft on visiting the poor and hiring labor, which can serve as a partial response to some of the issues, we hereby provide a brief response to other issues, hoping for guidance.
    I. Regarding the issue of uniting with the middle peasants, we are clear on this in "theory," but due to an unstable stance, after attacking our own landlord stance, we unconsciously generated the erroneous viewpoint of a one-sided "poor and hired peasant line." Therefore, in practice, we have been somewhat indifferent to the middle peasants and relaxed the implementation of the policy of "consolidating" and uniting with the middle peasants. (See the article "Why Did We Take a Detour" on the second page of the March 2nd issue for details.)
    II. The so-called "being fooled by Yang Sheng" is a self-criticism of our view of "actually not believing or not completely believing in the masses," which is not merely a matter of being "cautious" or "not cautious," but a matter of mass perspective.
    III. The letter states: "In point five, saying that the poor and hired peasants were 'tested,' we believe this is a statement from a leadership position, which contradicts the earlier statement of 'sincerely accepting the people's criticism.'" Regarding this point, I believe it can be explained as a matter of the relationship between cadres and the masses. We believe that cadres are both students and teachers of the masses. Because they are students, they should "sincerely accept the people's criticism" and "obtain the consent of the vast majority of people" (see the CPC Central Committee's February 22nd instruction) to avoid "committing the error of commandism" (ibid.). At this time, it shows that our staff is working for the masses, serving the masses, and being led by the masses. Because we are also teachers, we "must patiently persuade the masses regarding incorrect opinions that arise among them, and realize the leading role of the Party, and not commit the error of tailism" (ibid.). At this time, it shows that our staff is educating the masses, raising the masses, and leading the masses—being both students and teachers, being both led and leaders. The success or failure of the mass movement is a "test" for revolutionary workers and also a "test" for the revolutionary masses. "Testing" the poor and hired peasants does not contradict "accepting the people's criticism"; on the contrary, according to the spirit of the letter, only allowing cadres to be students, to be led, and to "accept the people's criticism," and not allowing cadres to be teachers, to "stand in a leadership position" and raise the masses, will inevitably lead to the error of tailism. Is this correct?
    IV. The term "Don Quixote-like" is not colloquial. We will pay attention in the future to thinking about for whom we are writing when writing, and reading it aloud to the poor peasants after writing it, to correct the "language" of intellectuals. In addition, I would like to state that the Tian Er Zhuang report was originally rewritten from a work report, therefore, it is neither specific enough nor colloquial enough.

### 关于田二庄的报导　答复贾、刘、黄三同志

　　关于田二庄的报导
  　答复贾、刘、黄三同志编辑同志：
    看到三月四日所载贾、刘、黄三同志对于田二庄工作报导提出的宝贵意见，除另稿访贫雇的点滴材料，可作为部分问题的答复外，兹对其他问题简复如下，尚望指导。
    一、关于团结中农问题，我们在“理论”上是明白的，但由于立场不稳，在打击了自己的地主立场之后，不自觉的产生了片面的“贫雇路线”的错误观点，因此，在实际上对中农态度有某种程度的冷淡，放松了贯彻“巩固”的团结中农的政策。（详见三月二日二版“为啥走了弯路”一文）
    二、所谓“上了杨生的当”是检讨我们“实际上不相信或不完全相信群众”的观点，不仅仅是“谨慎”不“谨慎”的问题，而是一个群众观念问题。
    三、来信说：“在第五点说‘考验’了贫雇，我们认为这是站在领导地位的说法，与前边‘诚恳接受人民的批评’相矛盾。”对于此点我认为可当做干部与群众的关系问题来解释。我们认为干部是群众的学生，也是群众的先生。因是学生，故应“诚恳接受人民的批评”，“取得绝大多数人的同意”，（见中共中央二、二二指示）才不致“犯命令主义的错误”（同上）。在这个时候，表现出我们工作人员是为群众、服从群众，受群众所领导的。因为我们又是先生，故“对于群众中发生的不正确意见，又必须耐心说服，实现党的领导作用，不要犯尾巴主义的错误”（同上）。在这个时候表现出我们工作人员是教育群众，提高群众，领导群众的——是学生又是先生，是被领导者又是领导者，群众运动的成功与失败，是对于革命工作者的“考验”，也是对于革命群众的“考验”。“考验”贫雇与“接受人民的批评”并不矛盾；反之，照来信的精神，只允许干部当学生，被领导，“接受人民的批评”，不允许干部当先生，“站在领导地位”提高群众，那样，必然要犯尾巴主义的错误。不知对否？
    四、“唐·吉诃德式的”名词不通俗，我们以后注意写东西时想到为谁写，写好后念给贫农听，以纠正知识分子“语句”。在此附带声明一句，田二庄报导，原是就工作报告改写的，因此，一不够具体，二不够通俗。（李珏、韩冰、更生）
