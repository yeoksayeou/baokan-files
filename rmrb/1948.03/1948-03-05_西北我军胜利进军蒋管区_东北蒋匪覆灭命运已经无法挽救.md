Weekly War Situation from February 26th to March 3rd:

The Northwest People's Liberation Army is victoriously marching into KMT-controlled areas, liberating the people of the Great Northwest. On the 1st, near Yichuan, the headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek-Hu Zongnan clique's direct line 29th Army was annihilated in one fell swoop, along with the headquarters of the reorganized 27th Division and the reorganized 90th Division, and their four subordinate reorganized brigades, achieving an unprecedented victory on the Northwest battlefield. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a special telegram to Generals Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zongxun, Zhao Shoushan, and others who commanded this battle, congratulating them. Last March 13th, when the Chiang Kai-shek-Hu Zongnan bandits invaded the border region, we pointed out that this was the Chiang Kai-shek-Hu Zongnan bandits digging their own graves, accelerating their demise. Only one year has passed, and the Chiang bandits have already buried a army headquarters, five division headquarters, and thirteen brigades (including eight reorganized brigades) in the border region. And the People's Liberation Army, after the recent reorganization of the troops and the winter training movement, has greatly improved its combat effectiveness and morale. This time, the march into KMT-controlled areas resulted in a major victory, with battle results equal to half of the achievements of the past nine months, fully demonstrating that our army is becoming stronger as it fights. The victory at Yichuan proves that the day when all the Hu Zongnan bandit troops are eliminated and the people of the Great Northwest are liberated is not far away.

The Northeast People's Liberation Army continued to fight victoriously. On the 26th and 27th of last month, it captured Yingkou, an important supply port of the Chiang bandits, and Xinkaiyuan, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits in the northeast of Shenyang. Even if the Chiang bandits wanted to reinforce the Northeast from the sea, it would be even more difficult. And in the Yingkou battle, the glorious uprising of the 58th Provisional Division of the Chiang army's 52nd Army under the leadership of General Wang Jiashan, precisely shows that the Chiang bandits in the Northeast have embarked on a path of disintegration, and at the same time points out a bright road for the Chiang army that is being annihilated whether it fights or defends. The fate of the Chiang bandits in the Northeast is beyond redemption. Even the American news agency Associated Press lamented: "The fate of the Kuomintang army is doomed to destruction," "I don't care whether we (the United States) have spent 570 million or 5.7 billion US dollars - the result is the same."

Coordinating with the victory of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, our army along the Guannei section of the Beining Railway is becoming more active. On the 21st of last month, the Jidong People's Liberation Army attacked Yangcun, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits, and annihilated more than 450 enemies.

On the southern front, the People's Liberation Army in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, and Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei regions all achieved victories. The People's Liberation Army of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Jianghan Military Region, following the capture of Yingshan and Anlu in mid-last month, captured Yunmeng County, northwest of Hankou, on the 22nd. On the same day, our local armed forces captured the Jiang bandits' stronghold of Zhenmasi, southeast of Jiangling County, annihilating more than 260 enemies. The Henan-Hubei army then captured Xixian again on the 25th. The Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui People's Liberation Army captured Bo County again on the 21st, annihilating nearly a thousand enemies and capturing the Chiang bandit county chief alive. On the 22nd, they ambushed the Chiang bandits at Mumaji, east of Shangqiu, annihilating 1,300 enemies. The Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the local armed forces, continued to wipe out local Chiang bandits in various places and carried out political offensives. Under the influence of our truth, those who were coerced into participating in the rebellion laid down their weapons and surrendered to us. Within half a month, in Jia County, Linru, Yiyang, Xun County and other places, more than 5,300 local Chiang bandits were resolved.

More than 1,400 local Chiang bandits and secret society armed forces, who harmed the Hua County, Fengqiu, and Yanjin areas of northern Henan in the Jinji-Luyu region, completely disintegrated last month after being suppressed by our local troops and undergoing political persuasion. Those who were coerced and deceived into participating were all sent back to their villages by the People's Liberation Army to turn over and divide the land with the peasants.

　　西北我军胜利进军蒋管区
  　东北蒋匪覆灭命运已经无法挽救
    二月二十六日至三月三日一周战况：
    西北解放军向蒋管区胜利进军，解放大西北人民。一日，在宜川附近，一举歼灭蒋胡匪嫡系二十九军军部，整二十七师整九十师两个师部及其所属四个整旅，获得西北战场空前大捷。中共中央委员会特电指挥此次战役的彭德怀、张宗逊、赵寿山等将军致贺。去年三月十三日蒋胡匪进犯边区，我们即指出这是蒋胡匪自掘坟墓，加速灭亡。至今为时不过一年，蒋匪在边区即已葬送了一个军部、五个师部、十三个旅的兵力（内八个整旅）。而解放军经过最近整编队伍，及冬季大练兵运动，战斗力与士气大大提高，此次挺进蒋区作战，即获大捷，战果等于过去九个月战绩的一半，充分表现我军愈战愈强。宜川的大捷证明：全部消灭胡宗南匪军，解放大西北人民的日子，已不在远了。
    东北解放军继续胜利作战，上月二十六、七两日连克蒋匪重要补给港口营口，及沈阳东北之蒋匪重要据点新开原。蒋匪即使想自海上增援东北也是更加困难了。而营口战役中，蒋军五十二军暂五十八师在师长王家善将军领导下的光荣起义，正说明东北蒋匪已走上分崩离析的绝境，同时为战也被歼，守也被歼的蒋军指出一条光明大道，东北蒋匪覆灭命运，是再无可挽救了。连美帝通讯社美联社也悲鸣：“国民党军的命运已注定了灭亡”，“我并不在意我们（美国）究竟化了五亿七千万或是五千七百亿美元——其结果都是一样的”。
    配合东北解放军的胜利，北宁路关内沿线我军益趋活跃，上月二十一日，冀东我军袭入蒋匪重要据点杨村，歼敌四百五十余名。
    南线方面，鄂豫皖、苏鲁豫皖及豫陕鄂各区解放军皆获胜利。鄂豫皖江汉军区解放军继上月中旬克应山、安陆两城后，二十二日又克汉口西北之云梦县城，同日，我地方武装攻克江陵县东南之圳马寺蒋匪据点，歼敌二百六十余人，豫鄂我军则于二十五日再克息县。苏鲁豫皖解放军二十一日再克亳县城，歼敌近千，并生俘蒋匪县长。二十二日，又于商邱东之牧马集阻击蒋匪，歼敌一千三百余。豫陕鄂解放军则配合地方武装继续肃清各地土蒋匪，并进行政治攻势，在我真理感召之下，被胁参加叛乱者，纷纷放下武器，向我投诚。半月内，在郏县，临汝、伊阳、勋县等地即解决土蒋匪达五千三百余名。
    晋冀鲁豫区为害豫北滑县、封邱、延津一带之土蒋匪及会门武装一千四百余人在上月经我地方部队之清剿，及政治感化，全部分崩瓦解，被迫及被欺骗参加者，皆经解放军遣送回村，与农民一起翻身分田。
