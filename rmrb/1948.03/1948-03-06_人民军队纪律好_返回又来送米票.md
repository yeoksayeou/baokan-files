　　People's Army Has Good Discipline;
  　Returns to Deliver Rice Coupons
    [Huguan News] In Shuzhang Village, Sixth District, on the second day of the Lunar New Year, five comrades from the 34th Regiment of the Independent 2nd Brigade stayed overnight at the village office. Their meals were provided by the local people. When they left, they took out a 50-jin rice coupon to settle the bill. However, the villagers didn't have any small denomination rice coupons, and the district office couldn't break the coupon either. At the time, it was a difficult situation for both the soldiers and the people. The villagers kindly offered to let them go. Because of the urgency of their marching mission, the five comrades had to leave a signed note to the villagers. On the 11th of this month, those five comrades passed through the village again and gave the villagers the rice for the meals they had eaten a few days before (the third day of the Lunar New Year), taking back the signed note. The villagers said, "We didn't expect them to come back and give us the rice. This is truly the People's Liberation Army, not harming the people's interests in the slightest. Their discipline is truly good; they don't eat our meals for nothing."
    In this area, it is common to see small groups of soldiers passing through. When they eat a meal, they take out large rice coupons and ask for change. If change cannot be provided, it creates a difficult situation for both the soldiers and the people. We suggest that supply departments of all units issue more small denomination rice coupons in the future to facilitate travel for the comrades and reduce trouble on the road. Otherwise, it is not good for the masses to suffer losses. (Zhuyu, Liangyu)

　　人民军队纪律好
  　返回又来送米票
    【壶关消息】六区树掌村，在过大年初二那天，有独二旅三十四团五个同志，黑夜住在村公所，饭派在群众家里，走时拿出一张五十斤的米票算帐，群众手内都没有零米票，又向区公所去找也没破开，当时弄的没有办法，军民两为难，该村群众亲切提出让他们走，这五个同志，因行军任务紧急，只好开下手章条子交给群众。在本月十一日，那五个同志又从村经过，把前几天（初三日）吃了饭的米交给群众，把手章条收回去。群众说：“没有想到他们还会回来给咱米，这真是人民解放军不违害群众一点利益，纪律真好，不白吃咱们一顿饭”。
    这个地方时常见到少数军队路过，吃了饭拿出大米票叫找零的，如找不开，就形成军民两为难。我们建议各部队供给机关今后为了便利行路，还是多发些零米票，让同志们在路上减少麻烦，否则群众吃亏也不好。　（珠玉、良玉）
