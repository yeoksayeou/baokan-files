　　[Taihang News] A severe outbreak of rinderpest was recently discovered in Chuandi Village, Pingshun. After collective research and prescription by veterinarians, it has been effectively treated. Yang Chunfu's ox in the village fell ill on the second day of the first lunar month. Initially, it refused to eat or drink, staggered, and passed black, watery stool with a grayish tinge. It died by the twelfth day. On the thirteenth and fourteenth days, most of the village's forty-odd oxen showed signs of the disease, with eight cases being severe, causing great anxiety among the people. Later, veterinarians were invited to investigate and found that the rinderpest was caused by insufficient water intake by the oxen due to the drought last year. Subsequently, three treatment methods were used, and the eight severe cases, along with the other thirty-odd milder cases, were cured. It was found that early treatment is essential, with different medications used depending on the size of the ox. The three treatment methods are now introduced as follows: (1) For an ox about four feet tall, use eight trifoliate oranges and four ounces of licorice root, mixed with boiling water and four ounces of powdered boar manure (roasted dry in a clay pot shard and ground into powder). After discarding the dregs, mix the water with the trifoliate oranges and licorice root, and drench the ox with it, which will be effective. (2) Drenching the ox with thirty egg whites (without the yolks) can also be effective. (3) Four ounces of dried white wattle bark are placed in a basin of cold water and allowed to soak until the water turns a blue color. The ox should then drink this water (no more than five bowls for large oxen and no more than three bowls for small oxen), and it will be effective.

　　川底发现牛瘟
  　现已研究出有效治法
    【太行消息】日前平顺川底村发现严重牛瘟，后经兽医集体研究开方，都给治好了。该村杨春富的牛，在正月初二这天有了病，一开始不吃不喝、东倒西歪、拉黑稀屎，并带灰色，到十二日就死了。十三、四两日，全村四十余只耕牛大部发现瘟症，内有八只很重，群众非常发慌。以后请来兽医研究了一下，发现牛瘟的原因是去年天旱缺水，耕牛饮水不足产生。接着用了三种治法，结果八只病重的，和其余三十余只病较轻的都治好了。发现有病就得早治，分牛大小，用药不同。现将三种治法介绍如下：（一）如四尺高之牛，用枳子八个、甘草四两，用开水泼起公猪粪（用沙锅片烤干、碾成面）四两，将渣子剩下，再把水与枳子、甘草拌在一块，灌下即有效。（二）用鸡蛋青（不用鸡黄）三十个灌下，也可见效。（三）白荆树皮四两（干的），放在冷水盆里，等泡成水发蓝色后，一喝便效（大牛五碗以下，小牛三碗以下）。
