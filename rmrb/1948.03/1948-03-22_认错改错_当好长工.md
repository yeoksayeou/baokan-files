　　Acknowledge and Correct Mistakes, Be a Good Hired Hand
    Many rural party members have been infected with bad thoughts and bad work styles, acting like overlords and oppressing the people. If this serious phenomenon is not thoroughly eliminated, the land reform cannot be thorough, and the masses cannot truly stand up. For this reason, it is necessary to reorganize the party ranks, and party members must undergo review by the masses. This work has now begun in many places. In the process, the enthusiasm and serious attitude of the masses are fully demonstrated. They are often not tired even after holding meetings for more than ten hours continuously, their speeches are enthusiastic, and attendance is complete, which is unprecedented. It can be seen that this party rectification work is closely combined with the demands of the masses, and the masses regard it as their own personal matter. At the same time, in the review of party members, it can also be seen that the eyes of the masses are bright, and the criticism of party members is clear on merits and demerits, and on public and private matters. For example, when the masses in Baicuo Village reviewed party member Wang Ting, Wang Ting examined himself for previously disliking the poor women's spun thread, but the masses said that he did it for work and should not be considered wrong. However, the masses' demands on party members are strict. They use the analogy: if a decent farmer scores sixteen liang, a communist party member must score twenty liang; for party members who do not reflect thoroughly, they are not easily passed and are still asked to continue reflecting. On the other hand, the masses also oppose the individual's venting of anger and retaliatory extremist emotions, and propose that opinions on party members should be reasonable and practical, without shielding or retaliation. All of this is enough to prove that the masses' attitude towards party members is strict and fair. As long as a party member reflects well, accepts criticism, the masses can forgive his past mistakes and warmly welcome his future corrections in practical actions.
    However, many party members do not reflect on themselves properly, attempting to conceal their mistakes and "pass the test" by luck; this is willingly giving up on oneself. The party will definitely not condone those party members who do not acknowledge and correct their mistakes and are opposed by the masses, and who have major mistakes; but for party members who can admit their mistakes and are willing to correct them, the party will adopt an educational approach. Facts have proved that the masses treat party members who can honestly reflect, acknowledge and correct their mistakes with warmth. We hope that rural party member comrades will earnestly reflect on their shortcomings and mistakes in this party rectification democratic movement, sincerely accept the criticism and review of the masses, and be determined to correct their mistakes. In this way, they will definitely be transformed and continue to be hired hands of the people; and in fact, there are already many good party members, whom the masses call people among the masses, who have gained the support of the masses in this party rectification democratic movement and have been re-elected as leaders through democratic elections.

### 认错改错　当好长工

　　认错改错  当好长工
    有许多农村党员，沾染了坏思想坏作风，作威作福，欺压人民。这种严重现象如果不彻底整掉，土地改革就不能彻底，群众不能真正翻身。为此，就要整编党的队伍，党员都要经过群众的审查。现在许多地方，已开始这一工作。在进行中，充分表现出群众的热情与认真的态度，往往连续开会十几小时都不疲倦，发言踊跃，到会齐全，为前所未有。可见这次整党工作，是与群众要求密切结合，群众把它看成了自己的切身事情。同时在审查党员中，也可以看出，群众的眼睛是明亮的，对党员的批判，功过分明、公私分明。如白错村群众审查党员时，党员王廷的检讨自己以前光嫌贫妇纺的线不好，但群众说他是为了工作，不能算错。可是群众对党员的要求又是严格的，他们打比方说：一个正派农民打上十六两，共产党员就得够二十两；对反省不彻底的党员，都不轻易通过，仍叫他继续反省。而另外一方面，群众却也反对个别人出气报复的偏激情绪，提出对党员提意见，要讲道理讲实际，不包庇不报复。这些都足以证明，群众对党员的态度，是严格而又公正的。只要一个党员好好反省，接受批评，群众就可以原谅他过去的错误，热诚欢迎他今后在实际行动上的改正。
    但是有不少党员，不好好反省自己，企图隐瞒错误，侥幸“过关”；这是甘心自暴自弃。党对那些不认错改错，被群众所反对的，有重大错误的党员，一定不予姑息；但对能承认错误又愿意改正错误的党员，都采取教育方针，事实证明，群众对于能老实反省，认错改错的党员，也是热诚相待的。我们希望农村党员同志，在这次整党民主运动中，认真反省自己的缺点和错误，诚恳接受群众的批评与审查，决心改正错误。这样，就一定能得到改造，继续当人民的长工；而且事实上，已有许多好党员，群众称之为群众里头的人，在这次整党民主运动中得到群众拥护，经过民主选举，仍被选为领导人。
