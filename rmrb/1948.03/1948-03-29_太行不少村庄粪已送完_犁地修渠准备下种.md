　　Taihang News: Many villages in Taihang have finished transporting manure and are turning to plowing, repairing ditches, and planting crops on some wasteland. In some villages in Shexian, Neiqiu, and Licheng, they have already begun sowing miscellaneous grains such as millet and hemp seeds on sloping land. In Dagang Village, Shexian County, under the slogan "Sow early, harvest early; sow late, no harvest," the masses began scattering millet on the mountain slopes from the 13th day of the first lunar month. Wei Zide's group has rushed to complete planting on forty-two mu of sloping land. Zhang Youcai and two other households in Longwangmiao, Licheng, have also taken time to plant fifteen mu of sloping land. Xiaoxi Village in Neiqiu has also planted 2,000 pits of hemp seeds. In Pozi Village, Xingtai, a total of three mu of land has been planted with hemp seeds. Many villages in Anyang, Pingshun, Neiqiu, Yuanshi, and Shexian counties are plowing and harrowing white land, repairing borders and building embankments, opening up virgin land, and clearing fallow land to further prepare for sowing. In villages such as Duhetuo in Anyang, after middle and poor peasants learned that the land would not be greatly changed, they reorganized mutual aid teams from the 14th day of the first lunar month and mobilized to plow the land. By the 20th, when they summarized their work, they had plowed more than 400 mu. With another ten days, they could plow all the land. The twenty-eight head of livestock in Duhetuo Village plowed more than 700 mu in ten days. The remaining 200 mu that had not been plowed were being rushed to be completed in early February under the slogan "Finish plowing quickly and engage in transportation." In the new district of Yuanshi, due to previous disturbances by the traitor Wei Yonghe, there was a lot of wasteland. After the rain at the end of the first lunar month, Silianshuang Village held a mass discussion on production issues and decided not to ride livestock when visiting relatives, but to concentrate on plowing the land. To overcome the difficulties of labor and livestock power, they organized many people to pull plows. By the 16th of this month, the entire village had plowed more than half of the land. Zhao Tong Village has a total of 14 qing of wasteland. In addition to organizing livestock to rush to plow, the village chief Chen Heini and the director of the Armed Forces Committee personally took the lead in organizing three groups of people to pull plows and actively rush to plow. In Hongjing Village, Licheng, 350 mu of land were harrowed in eight days. In Huangbeiping, Shuiyu, Yanggao, and other villages in Pingshun, after rectifying mutual aid and reforming the landlords and rich peasants in power, the enthusiasm for production was very high. In half a month, the three villages of Yanggao plowed 150 mu of land, built 110 zhang of embankments, and removed stones from 18 mu of land, leveling 7.5 mu of land. When the masses in Beigu Village discussed production work after delivering manure on the 15th of this month, the political director said: "Early millet is harvested every year, late millet is a gamble," and sowing is imminent, so repairing land and building embankments is the central task at present. The next day, the entire village divided up to rush to repair land and build embankments. Due to the high enthusiasm for production, many local masses proposed to surpass last year's output by opening ditches and adding manure. Some places with narrow land are rushing to open up wasteland to increase income. In Caozhuang, Licheng, in order to achieve an increase of five sheng of refined grain per mu in the entire district, a large amount of wasteland fertilizer is being produced, and 9.5 mu of wasteland has been opened up to ensure 40 loads of manure per mu (five loads more than last year). When Zhanglidian in Wu'an held a production mobilization meeting on the evening of the 12th day of the first lunar month, the poor and hired peasants proposed: "If you want to increase production, opening ditches is a good way." Everyone agreed with his opinion, and under the leadership of the poor and hired peasants, the two-li-long ditch was completed with only 292 workdays. Everyone happily said: Our village has another 180 mu of land that is not afraid of drought. Under the leadership of the village cadres, Xiama Village in Neiqiu opened a three-li-long ditch, irrigating a total of 121 mu of land. After the ditch was opened on the 24th day of the first lunar month, everyone rushed to extend it to expand the irrigated area. In Suicheng, Zuoquan, in order to increase production and prevent drought, the entire village used only half a day to clear a five-li-long ditch. The masses are now irrigating and fertilizing the land in preparation for sowing.
    Taihang News: The sheep workers in Beishe Village, Pingshun, promoted class friendship by letting poor households use their sheep to fertilize the land at a low price, helping poor households increase production, and establishing a sheep worker cooperative to solve their own shoe and sock difficulties. There are six flocks of sheep and fifteen sheep workers in the village. Now is the time for spring plowing and fertilization. Many poor households lack manure. After learning about this situation, the sheep workers held a meeting under the leadership of the group leader Cao Niuma and decided: (1) Give rice to poor military families when letting sheep fertilize their land, depending on the situation. (2) Generally, poor households with 150 sheep fertilizing the land overnight will pay 40 jin of millet. This can be reduced for poor and hired peasants who have not yet been fully emancipated. If there is no rice, it can be given in the autumn. In this way, the newly emancipated and not fully emancipated poor and hired peasants were able to increase a lot of fertilizer by letting sheep fertilize their land. The poor peasant Cao Shangli happily said: "I have lived for dozens of years, and I have never had sheep fertilize my land. This year, the manure from the sheep is more than enough for five mu of land, and I am sure that I can achieve an increase of three sheng of grain per mu." In addition, because they graze sheep on the mountains every day, it is difficult to find time to participate in the village's political activities, and the difficulty of shoes and socks is also difficult to solve. Last December, everyone came up with a solution: decide to select two sheep workers to raise funds to open a cooperative, so that they can solve their own difficulties and participate in the village's activities. They raised a total of 70,000 yuan in shares and opened a grocery store in the village, selling necessities such as oil, salt, cloth, etc. needed by the masses. When the accounts were settled in February this year, one yuan earned one yuan.

　　太行不少村庄粪已送完
  　犁地修渠准备下种
    【太行消息】太行不少村庄，已结束运粪，转向犁地修渠及进行部分荒地下种等生产工作。涉县、内邱、黎城有的村已开始往坡地下种与典种大麻籽等杂粮。涉县大港村群众在“早种早收，晚种不收”的口号下，从正月十三日，全村开始往山坡地撒谷；魏子德组四十二亩坡地已突击完成。黎城龙王庙张有才等三户的十五亩坡地，也抽空下了种；内邱小西村也种了大麻籽两千窑。邢台坡子村下种大麻籽地共合三亩。安阳、平顺、内邱、元氏、涉县等县不少村庄正在犁耙白地，修边垒堰，开生荒、灭熟荒，进一步准备下种工作。安阳杜贺驼等村，中贫农知道了土地不会大动后，从正月十四即整顿了互助组，全部出动犁地，到二十日总结时，已犁了四百多亩，再有十天就可全部犁完。杜贺驼村二十八犋牲口，十天犁了七百余亩，剩下未犁的二百余亩，又在“赶快犁完搞运输”的口号下，争取二月初犁完。元氏新区由于以前受魏逆永和扰乱，荒地很多，正月底下雨后，四联庄召开群众讨论生产问题，决定走亲戚不骑牲口，全力突击犁地，为克服劳畜力困难，又组织了不少人拉犁，到本月十六日全村已犁了一大半。赵同村一共有荒地十四顷，除组织牲口赶犁外，村长陈黑妮、武委会主任等亲自带头组织了三组人拉犁积极赶犁。黎城洪井村八天耙地三百五十多亩。平顺黄背坪、水峪、阳高等村，经过整顿互助，改造了当权的地富分子后，生产劲头很大，阳高等三个村半月犁地一百五十亩、垒堰一百一十丈，在十八亩地内拾去了石头，垫平了七亩五分地。北顾村群众于本月十五讨论送完粪后的生产工作时，政治主任说：“直谷年年收，晚谷碰年头”，眼看就要下种，修地垒堰是当前的中心工作；第二天全村就分头突击修地垒堰，由于生产情绪高涨，不少地方群众提出要以开渠加粪超过去年产量。一部分土地狭窄的地方，正在突击开荒以增加收入。黎城曹庄，为了全区达到每亩增产五升细粮，正在大量造荒肥，并开了九亩五分荒地，保证每亩上粪四十驮（比去年加五驮）。武安张里店于正月十二日晚上开生产动员会时，贫雇群众提出：“要想增加生产，开渠还是好办法”。大家也同意他的意见，在贫雇带头下，二里长的渠，只用了二百九十二个工就完成了，大家高兴的说：咱村又有一百八十亩地不怕天旱了。内邱下马庄在村干部领导下，开了一条三里长的渠，共浇地一百二十一亩；该渠于正月二十四日开成后，大家又突击往长修，扩大浇地面积。左权粟城群众为了增产防旱，全村群众只用了半天时间，把五里长的一条渠挑通，群众现在浇地灌粪，准备下种。
    【太行消息】平顺北社村羊工发扬阶级友爱，低价给贫苦户卧地，帮助贫苦户增加生产，并兴办羊工合作社，解决自己鞋袜困难。该村共有羊六群，十五个羊工。现在正是春耕上肥时节，许多贫苦户缺乏粪土，羊工们了解了这种情况后，就在组长曹牛马领导下开了个会，决定：（一）给贫苦军属户卧地时看情形给米。（二）一般贫苦户卧一夜（一百五十个羊）小米四十斤，没翻透身的贫雇户可减少，如没米时可等秋后再给。这样一来新翻身的和没翻透身的贫雇户，都能卧地增加了不少肥料。贫农曹尚礼高兴的说：“我活了几十岁啦，没叫羊给卧过地，今年羊卧的粪，上五亩地是绰绰有余，保险能达到每亩增产三升粮。”另外因他们每天在山上放羊，村里的政治活动很难抽时间参加，而且鞋袜困难也不好解决。去年腊月大家想了个办法：决定抽出两个羊工来集资开个合作社，一来可解决本身困难，二来也能参加村里的活动。他们一共集了七万元股金，在本村开了个杂货铺，贩卖群众需用的油盐花布等必需品，到今年二月结了一下帐，一元赚了一元。
