Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- New York Dispatch: "The price plunge on February 4th marks a fundamental change in the American economic process," this is the anguished confession in the Associated Press's "Business Situation of the Week" on the 22nd. The dispatch then goes on to describe the state of panic in American industry, saying: "The plunge in grain and commodity prices is more violent than many people realize. Although the initial shock is gradually disappearing, it is being replaced by semi-certain ominous signs, and even infinite fear about the future." It also states: "Hesitation rules Wall Street and other parts of the United States. Economists are now unanimously of the opinion that the plunge in agricultural prices will have, or is having, a decisive impact on business, ...to the extent that it directly affects production and employment."

　　苦恼统治华尔街
  　物价暴跌必打击生产与就业
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】纽约讯：“二月四日的物价暴跌，标志着美国经济进程的根本改变”，这是美联社二十二日“一周商情”中苦恼的自供。该电继即描述美国实业界的恐慌状态称：“谷物与商品价格的暴跌，比许多人认识到的都猛烈。第一次震惊虽渐消失，但代之而起的，则是半确定的凶兆，甚至对前途如何的无比恐惧”。又称：“犹豫不决统治着华尔街和美国其他部分。经经学家现在一致的意见是，农产品价格的暴跌，对商业将产生或正产生决定性的影响，…已到了直接影响生产与就业的程度”。
