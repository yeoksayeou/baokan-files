Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 25th: TASS, London - Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, stated in a speech in the Tilbury constituency on the 21st that Truman, in his statement to Congress, formally criticized the war propaganda of the Tory financial magnates. He blatantly stated that the United States would support the Western European alliance with force, because he believed that the United States could make a fortune in the arms trade and reap the benefits when the latter fought against the Soviet Union and the new democracies. Pollitt denounced Truman's statement on Italy and the United States' actions in Italy as the most blatant and outrageous interference in the internal affairs of other countries since the armed intervention in the Soviet Union in 1917. He openly said to the Italian people: "Elect the reactionaries! Otherwise, we will starve you and kill you!" Pollitt continued: "The British people must resolutely oppose war preparations. All peace-loving men and women must take action and launch a new offensive to change the policies of the Labour government, so that new trade and political negotiations can be started with the Soviet Union. If Britain and the Soviet Union adhere to peace, no other country will dare to organize a new world war."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 25th: Prague - Former Czechoslovak Deputy Foreign Minister, Klementis, was appointed Foreign Minister by President Beneš on the 20th. Klementis delivered his first radio address that evening, clarifying Czechoslovakia's foreign policy, stating: "Czechoslovakia will continue to firmly oppose attempts to use Germany as a political springboard to invade countries formerly ravaged by Hitler." Klementis solemnly pointed out: "He does not believe there is a danger of war, because the provocations of warmongers will inevitably be thwarted by the strength of the Soviet Union and its allies." Klementis denounced "maliciously creating war propaganda, which will not be conducive to cooperation and understanding between countries." And strongly stated: "The recent anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic countries' propaganda movement has only strengthened the determination of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to work hard on construction." Finally, Klementis expressed contempt for the Security Council's forced acceptance of Chile's accusations, attempting to discuss the so-called Czech incident, calling it "a disgrace to the Security Council."

　　波立特号召英人行动起来
  　向工党反动政策进攻
    捷新外长力斥战争贩子叫战
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：英共总书记波立特二十一日在梯洛尔城选区发表演说称：杜鲁门在其国会声明中，正式批评了托辣斯大财阀的战争宣传。他明目张胆的表示：美国将以武力支持西欧联盟，因为他相信美国在后者对苏联与新民主国家作战中，可大做其军火生意，坐收渔利。波氏指斥杜氏关于意大利的声明与美国在意的行动，是一九一七年武装干涉苏联以来对他国内政最放肆露骨的干涉，他公然对意国人民说：“选举反动派吧！否则我们就饿死你，杀死你！”波氏继称：“英国人民必须坚决反对备战，一切热爱和平的男女必须行动起来，发动一个新进攻，以改变工党政府的政策，这样才能和苏联开始新的贸易和政治谈判。如果英苏坚守和平，就没有别的国家胆敢组织新的世界战争。”
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】布拉格讯：前捷克外交部国务委员克里门蒂斯，已于二十日接受总统贝奈斯任命继任外交部长，克氏当晚即发表首次广播演说，阐明捷克外交政策称：“捷克将继续坚决反对利用德国作为政治跳板，以侵略从前受希特勒蹂躏之各国的企图。”克氏郑重指出：“他不相信有战争的危险，因为战争贩子的挑衅，必将碰到苏联及其同盟国的力量而破灭。”克氏痛斥“恶意制造战争宣传，将不利于各国间的合作与谅解。”并力言：“最近的反苏反人民民主国家的宣传运动，只是加强了苏维埃国家与各人民民主国家努力建设的决心。”克氏最后对安理会被迫接受智利控诉，而妄图讨论所谓捷克事件，表示鄙弃，称之为“安理会的耻辱”。
