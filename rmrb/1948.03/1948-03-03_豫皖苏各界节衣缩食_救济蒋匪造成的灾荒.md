Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, 29th: The Yu-Wan-Su Administrative Office recently decided to allocate 10 million catties of autumn grain and a large amount of loans to relieve the disaster-stricken people suffering from floods and plunder by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The first batch of 400,000 catties has been allocated for emergency relief to disaster victims in the Huangfan area. It was also decided to repair water conservancy projects in the Huangfan area as a form of work-for-relief. The Administrative Office has also launched a campaign for all troops, organizations, and the vast people to practice thrift and donate money and grain to actively help and organize disaster victims in production to overcome the spring famine. It is reported that the second and third districts of Yu-Wan-Su suffered from floods last autumn, and the people suffered heavy losses due to the intrusion of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. In the fifth district, the ten counties in the Huangfan area, including Xihua and Fugou, were the last to recede from the floodwaters, resulting in a serious spring famine, especially in Xihua and Fugou counties.

In other news: The "Hundred Yuan Disaster Relief Campaign" launched by the Eastern Front Corps of the East China Field Army has now come to an end. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 25,870,000 Yuan in Beihai currency and a large number of other silver dollars and clothing items were donated. The donations from various units are now being unified by the Political Department of the Field Army and distributed to the masses in various parts of Shandong Province who have suffered severely from Chiang Kai-shek's disasters. In this mass patriotic movement, many vivid and touching stories have emerged, demonstrating the essence of the people's army. Hou Deyou, the "Iron Man Hero" of a certain unit, donated all six silver dollars he had saved for medical expenses. A soldier named Li Huiheng donated a gold ring that he had kept for several years. When a certain company was discussing why they should provide disaster relief, everyone related it to the brutality of Chiang Kai-shek's "three alls" policy that they had witnessed in the Yimeng Mountains in the past, and the misery of the masses who had suffered from Chiang Kai-shek's disasters. Everyone immediately donated enthusiastically and decided to save 22,800 yuan in Beihai currency and 300 catties of grain from the company's food to provide disaster relief.

　　豫皖苏各界节衣缩食
    救济蒋匪造成的灾荒
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖廿九日电】豫皖苏行署顷决定拨秋粮一千万斤及大批贷款救济遭受水灾及蒋匪掠夺之灾民，现已拨出第一批四十万斤急赈黄泛区灾民。并决定于黄泛区兴修水利以工代赈。行署更发动各部队机关及广大人民节衣缩食捐款献粮，积极帮助和组织灾民生产，渡过春荒。按豫皖苏二、三分区去秋遭受水灾，又因蒋匪军窜扰，人民损失惨重。五分区所属黄泛区西华、扶沟等十县，水退最迟，致发生严重春荒，尤以西华、扶沟两县为最。
    另讯：华东野战军东线兵团各部队、机关展开之“百元救灾运动”，现已告一段落。据初步统计共捐献北海币二千五百八十七万余元，其他银洋衣物等甚多。现各部捐款正由野战军政治部，统一交山东省政府散发各地惨受蒋灾之群众。此一群众性爱民运动中，出现许多生动感人事例，表现了人民军队的本质。某部“铁人英雄”侯得有把节约养伤费存下的六块银洋全部捐出，战士李会恒捐出保存了几年的一支金戒指。某连在讨论为什么要救灾时，大家联系到过去在沂蒙山区亲眼见到蒋匪三光政策之残暴，及受蒋灾群众之悲惨，大家当场就踊跃捐输，并公决从本连伙食中节约出北海币二万二千八百元及粮食三百斤救灾。
