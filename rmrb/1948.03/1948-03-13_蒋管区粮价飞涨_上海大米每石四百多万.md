　　Jiang-Controlled Area Grain Prices Soar
  　Shanghai Rice Reaches Over Four Million Per Shi
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th] Compiled from Jiang area newspaper reports: Prices in various cities in the Jiang-controlled areas are soaring universally. On the 27th of last month, the prices of grain and general merchandise in Tianjin reached new peaks. "Warship Brand" flour rose to 1.7 million Jiang currency per bag, and Xiaozhan rice rose to 33,000 yuan per jin. All prices generally doubled in less than ten days compared to the 19th of last month. In Peiping on the 26th of last month, corn flour cost 15,000 yuan per jin, an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to twenty days prior. Peanut oil cost 65,000 yuan per jin, an increase of 19,000 yuan compared to twenty days prior. In Nanjing on the 26th, prices were extremely chaotic. Companies and shops changed their prices several times a day, and rice shops were mostly closed. In Wuhan on the 20th, prices also rose sharply. Important officials of the Jiang bandit Grain Department were all rushing to buy grain in Wuhan in order to hoard it. In Shanghai on the 25th, the price of rice per dan broke through the 3 million mark, and by the 9th it had risen to 4.2 million. According to estimates from Shanghai business circles quoted by the Tianjin Yishi Daily, white rice will rise to 10 million per dan around the Qingming Festival.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th] According to various sources: On the 9th, prices in Shanghai skyrocketed, with the price of rice per dan rising to 4.2 million Jiang currency. Compared to the first price fluctuation in the Jiang area this year in January, when it was 1.58 million, it is now more than one and a half times higher, and three times higher than at the beginning of the year, reaching an unprecedented record of 420,000 times the pre-war price of rice. Millions of Shanghai citizens have been alarmed and disoriented by this. Rice prices in major cities such as Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing are also soaring. This situation demonstrates that a grain panic spanning the entire Jiang-controlled area has arrived. An AP dispatch from Shanghai on the 9th, citing news from Chengdu, stated that starving masses in the city had repeatedly launched rice-grabbing riots, and the entire city had fallen into panic.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] According to Jiang area newspapers, the devaluation of Jiang currency and the rise in prices in the Jiang area from before the war to the present are as follows: The purchasing power of 100 Jiang currency yuan was two oxen in 1937; one large ox and one small ox in 1938; one ox in 1939; one small ox in 1940; one pig in 1941; one ham in 1942; one chicken in 1943; one sheng of rice in 1944; one fish in 1945; one egg in 1946; one-fifth of a short fried dough stick in 1947; and one-twentieth of a small baked wheat cake in January 1948.
