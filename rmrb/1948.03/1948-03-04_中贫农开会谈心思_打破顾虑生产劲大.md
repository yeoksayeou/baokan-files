　　Middle and Poor Peasants Hold Meetings to Discuss Thoughts
    Dispel Concerns and Increase Production Enthusiasm
    [Our News] Guangwu Village in the Fifth District of Pingshun held a heart-to-heart meeting for poor, hired, and middle peasants on the night of the thirteenth day of the lunar month. First, they mobilized everyone by emphasizing that poor and hired peasants are one family, and then had everyone discuss their inner thoughts and feelings in groups. For example, Wang Jincai said: "I am not afraid of anything, but when I see meetings for poor and hired peasants that don't include me, I think there must be some problem!" Middle peasant Wang Youqun said: "They keep talking about delivering fertilizer, but now we are adjusting land, which plot should we deliver it to?" Poor and hired peasants Wang Zicheng and Wang Shuicheng said: "We immigrated here last year and didn't get a good plot of land. Now that we have pulled the fertilizer to the land, if you give us good land, we don't have fertilizer to transport at all." In each group, people spoke one sentence after another, and it was very lively. After these specific thoughts were raised, the middle peasant said: "We are one family and don't have two minds. Spring is early this year, and we are adjusting land again. If we don't deliver fertilizer, it will delay planting." Finally, three brigades were divided to discuss and set plans, and all labor and livestock power were concentrated to transport fertilizer. (Pingshun Small Newspaper)
    [Pingshun News] Qingcaowa Village in the Third District held a meeting of mutual aid societies and mutual aid team leaders on the third day of the first lunar month to study this year's spring plowing preparations and review the shortcomings of last year's mutual aid labor exchange. Everyone pointed out that due to the year's disasters and famine, some wage issues had not been resolved. After research, it was decided to resolve the remaining issues while carrying out spring plowing preparations. On the fourth day, all mutual aid group members were convened to reorganize the groups, and they could join whichever group they wanted. Political Director Shi Huaixin pointed out that this year's spring plowing work is very tight, and there is a lack of labor, so we must seize the time to transport manure and firewood. Then, poor peasant Zhang Ziliang proposed to use all the labor force to carry manure on the fifth day, which everyone agreed to. On the fifth day, a total of forty-eight full and semi-laborers participated, and they carried a total of 325 loads of manure that day. They continued to carry for four days, carrying a total of more than 1,300 loads, leaving only a small portion at home. The mutual aid society, based on the village's situation, transferred labor to combine with other life activities, such as grinding bran, chopping firewood, delivering fertilizer, and drying radish strips.

　　中贫农开会谈心思
    打破顾虑生产劲大
    【本报消息】平顺五区广武村在阴历十三日夜召开了贫雇中农谈心会，首先把贫雇中农是一家人作了动员，让大家分组圪拉谈心思话，扯个人的心思感觉。如王进才说：“我什么也不怕就是看见贫雇开会也不叫我，我想这不定又有什么问题啦？”中农王有群说：“光说送肥哩，现在抽补土地呀，往哪块地送对啊？”贫雇王自成、王水成等都说：“咱去年移民到这里，没赶上分好地，现在把肥都拉到地里，给咱分上好地，运肥都没有了。”各组里你一句，我一句，吵的很热闹，经提出这些具体思想后，中农说：“咱们是一家人，不存两条心，今年春浅，又要抽补土地，不送粪误了种地可不是耍哩”。最后分三个大队，讨论订计划，所有劳畜力都集中运肥。　　　　　　（平顺小报）
    【平顺消息】三区青草洼村，在元月初三日（阴历）召开互助社及互助组长会议，研究今年的春耕准备工作，并回顾了去年互助变工有何缺点。大家提出因年景灾荒，有部分工资问题没清理。研究后决定一面清理遗留问题，一面进行春耕准备工作。初四又召集全体互助组员，重新整顿结组，愿到哪组到哪组，政治主任史怀信提出，今年春耕工作是十分紧张的，劳力又缺乏，我们要抓紧时间，运粪打柴。接着有贫雇张子良提出要在初五日用全部劳力进行担粪，大家都同意。初五日全半劳力共参加人数四十八名，这一天统计共担粪三百二十五担，继续担了四天，共担一千三百多担，家里只留很少部分了。互助社根据村里情况，抽调劳力，结合做其它生活、如推糠、打柴、送肥、晒萝卜条等。
