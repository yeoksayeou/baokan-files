Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Hanoi dispatch: Of the 9,260,000 population of Tonkin, Vietnam, only 1,500,000 are under the control of the French aggressors. According to a March 13th Agence France-Presse dispatch, since the Viet Minh government withdrew from Hanoi in January of last year, over a year ago, the French imperialists, after spring and autumn offensives, have only controlled 500,000 mountain people (chiefs, White Thai, Black Thai, etc.) and 1,000,000 Annamese people in Hanoi, Haiphong, and the surrounding areas of the Red River Delta. The Red River Delta has a total population of 3,000,000; the remaining 1,500,000 and the more than 4,700,000 in other areas surrounding the delta still live in the Viet Minh liberated areas. Furthermore, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch of March 11th: in the week prior to March 6th, the Franco-Vietnamese war was fiercely fought in the Hue and Hoa Quang areas of Annam, the My Tho and Bien Hoa areas of Cochinchina, and the border areas between Laos and Siam.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Yogyakarta dispatch: The Indonesian People's Democratic Front issued a statement on the 11th, condemning the US and Dutch imperialists for establishing a provisional federal government, stating: The important positions in the new government are all controlled by the Netherlands. Van Mook, as the head of the provisional federal government, wields the same power as the governor-general or deputy governor-general during the former Dutch colonial regime. He can exercise the supreme command of all armed forces. Therefore, the new institution is merely the old colonial government with a slightly altered facade. The statement forcefully stated: "The Indonesian armed forces should be placed under the leadership of anti-colonial groups in order to protect the Indonesian nation from Dutch imperialist aggression; otherwise, the Indonesian people will lose their revolutionary strength."

     越盟在东京区势力强大　印尼民主阵线抨击美荷
    【新华社陕北十七日电】河内讯：拥有九百二十六万人口的越南东京，迄今仅有一百五十万人在法国侵略者控制之下。据法新社十三日电，自去年一月越盟政府退出河内后，一年余以来，法帝国主义经过春季与秋季的攻势，仅在红河三角洲之河内海防及其附近地区，控制了五十万山民（土司、白泰、黑泰等）及一百万安南人。红河三角洲共有三百万人口，其余一百五十万及该三角洲周围其他地区四百七十余万人，仍生活在越盟解放区内。又据法新社十一日电：三月六日以前一周中，法越间战争，曾在安南的顺化及和光区，交趾支那的美沙及边和地区，以及老挝与暹罗边界地区，激烈进行。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】日惹讯：印尼人民民主阵线十一日发表声明，抨击美荷帝国主义成立临时联邦政府称：新政府之重要职位，均操在荷兰手里，作为临时联邦政府首脑的范穆克，握有前荷兰殖民地政权期间总督或副总督同样的权力，他可以行使一切武装部队最高指挥的职权。因此，新机构只是稍加改头换面的旧有殖民地政府而已。声明力称：“印尼武装部队应置于反殖民地集团的领导之下，以便保卫印尼民族免受荷帝的侵略，否则，就会使印尼人民丧失他们的革命力量”。
