　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Reports from various sources: The American reactionaries' conspiracy to split the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) continues to suffer strong counterattacks from the labor circles of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and Italy. In early February, the American reactionaries sent Carey (Financial Secretary of the CIO) and Ross (Director of the International Department of the CIO), both right-wing leaders of the CIO, to London for activities. Under Carey's instructions, on February 16th, Deakin (General Secretary of the British Transport and General Workers' Union, and current Chairman of the WFTU), using the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) General Council as a guise, threatened the WFTU Executive Bureau with an ultimatum to convene a meeting in February to discuss the "Marshall Plan." This rogue behavior aroused the righteous indignation of workers around the world. Saillant, the General Secretary of the WFTU, believed that Deakin's actions could not intimidate anyone. Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the USSR, condemned Deakin's intention to split the WFTU. Frachon, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT), issued a statement protesting Deakin's divisive intention to convene a WFTU meeting within a deadline, pointing out: "It has aroused the indignation of French trade unionists." After Carey's action to split from within the WFTU failed, he openly prepared, through the reactionary heads of the British, Belgian, and Dutch trade unions, to convene a so-called "European Sixteen Countries Trade Union" conference in London on March 9th and 10th, with invitations issued by the British TUC General Council. However, this attempt to establish a puppet international trade union organization has been met with the just counterattacks from French and Italian workers. The French CGT sternly refused to participate in the "London Conference" discussing the Marshall Plan on February 25th. The French CGT pointed out: "The purpose of the Marshall Plan is for American expansionists to establish world domination, therefore it threatens the security, independence, and economy of European countries. Those invited to participate in this conference are some trade unions hostile to the unity of the labor movement and the WFTU, such as the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the French "Workers' Force." This fact exposes this conference's hostility towards the unity of the world labor movement." The French CGT vowed to "remain loyal to the unity of trade unions worldwide and to the WFTU." The Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) formally announced its refusal to participate on the 2nd of this month.

　　美帝阴谋分裂世职
  　遭受各国有力反击
    【新华社陕北四日电】各方讯：美国反动派分裂世职的阴谋，继续受到苏、法、英、意各国职工界的有力反击。二月初，美反动派派了产联右派头子加莱（产联财政秘书）和罗斯（产联国际部主任）到伦敦活动。在加莱指令下，二月十六日狄金（英运输业与各业工人联合会总书记，现任世职主席）借英职工大会常委会的名义，以哀的美敦书手段，要胁世职执行局限于二月间召开会议，来讨论“马歇尔计划”，这种无赖行为，激起了世界各国工人的义愤。世职总书记赛南认为狄金的行为吓唬不了谁。苏联职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐失斥狄金意图分裂世职。法总工会总书记佛拉商发表声明，抗议狄金限期召开世职会议的分裂意图，指出：“已激起法国职工会人士的义愤。”加莱从世职内部进行分裂的这一行动失败以后，便通过英、比、荷三国总工会的反动头子，更公开筹备于三月九日、十两日在伦敦召开所谓“欧洲十六国职工会”，由英总工会常委会发出邀请书。但这种建立伪国际职工组织的企图，已首先遭到法意工人的正义回击。法总工会于二月二十五日严辞拒绝参加讨论马歇尔计划的“伦敦会议”。法总工会指出：“马歇尔计划的目的是美国扩张主义者建立世界统治，因此它威胁到欧洲国家的安全、独立与经济。被邀参加这一会议的都是敌视职工运动统一和世职的一些工会，如美国劳联和法国“工人力量”，这种事实暴露了这一会议对世界工运的统一的敌意”。法总工会发誓“仍忠于全世界职工会的统一，并忠于世职”。意总工会则于本月二日正式宣布拒绝与会。
