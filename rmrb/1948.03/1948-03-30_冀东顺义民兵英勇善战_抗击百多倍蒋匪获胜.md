Xinhua News Agency, Hebei, 27th—The heroic militia of Jiaoyufang Village in the Shunyi County border area valiantly resisted the siege of over a hundred times their number of Chiang bandit troops and emerged victorious. On the 28th of last month, a portion of the 63rd Division of the Chiang bandits from Miyun, along with over 1,500 Chiang bandits from strongholds in Tong County, Shunyi, Huairou, and Niulanshan, carrying two flat-trajectory guns, four mortars, one rocket launcher, and four heavy machine guns, surrounded the village. The dozen or so militiamen in the village immediately resisted, persisting from dawn until afternoon. The Chiang bandits launched six assaults, all of which were repelled by the militia with hand grenades. Seeing that they could not conquer, the Chiang bandit officers attempted to demoralize the militia, shouting towards the building the militia was defending, "Eighth Route Army, surrender your guns!" The militia replied, "Surrender your mother's bullets!" They continued to resist until the building was set on fire by artillery and two breaches were opened, at which point the militia retreated into the tunnels. After the Chiang bandits entered the village, they stepped on landmines, which exploded, scattering blood and flesh. Afraid to stay for long, they hastily retreated after extensive looting and burning. In this engagement, ten bandits including a company commander were killed and seventeen were wounded. Only one of our militiamen heroically sacrificed his life. Upon hearing the news, the county democratic government immediately sent 6 million yuan, livestock, and grain for relief. The masses from neighboring villages also rushed to offer condolences. The morale and confidence of the villagers were further boosted, and they unanimously expressed their determination to fight the Chiang bandit troops to the end.

　　冀东顺义民兵英勇善战
  　抗击百多倍蒋匪获胜
    【新华社冀东二十七日电】顺义县边缘区焦玉房村十余民兵英勇抗击百余倍蒋匪军的围攻获得胜利。上月二十八日，密云蒋匪六十三师一部纠集通县、顺义、怀柔、牛栏山等据点蒋匪一千五百余人，携平射炮两门、迫击炮四门、火箭炮一门、重机枪四挺，包围该村，村内十余民兵当即抗御，自拂晓开始坚持到下午，蒋匪曾先后发动六次冲锋，均被民兵用手榴弹打退，蒋匪军官见攻打不下，企图进行瓦解，遂向民兵坚守之楼子高叫“八路军缴枪吧！”民兵答称：“缴你妈的子弹头。”他们仍继续抗击，直至楼子被炮击起火，并打开两个缺口，民兵才转入地道。蒋匪进村后，又踏响地雷，炸得血肉横飞，不敢久留，在大肆抢劫焚烧后仓惶退走。此次共毙匪连长以下十名，伤十七名，我民兵仅一人光荣牺牲。该县民主政府闻讯，即携款六百万及牲口粮食等前往救济；邻村群众亦纷纷赶来慰问，该村群众情绪及信心更为提高，一致表示要与蒋匪军坚持斗争到底。
