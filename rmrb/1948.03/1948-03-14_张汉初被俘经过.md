Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, March 12th: Frontline reporters report the capture of Zhang Hanchu, commander of the 24th Brigade of the defending enemy in Yichuan City:

After the battle to liberate Yichuan City on the morning of the 3rd, Zhang Hanchu could not be found anywhere in the city. According to captured soldiers, he jumped over the city wall and fled in the middle of the night. On the third night, it was particularly dark. Several soldiers from a certain unit were driving grain-carrying livestock from Wuliping, five miles west of the city, to Xiwa Kiln. Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of them. Soldier Li Erjia saw it first and shouted, "Who's there?" The figure replied, "From the headquarters, connecting lines," his voice sounding flustered. Soldier Qiao Fu immediately rushed forward, pointed his gun at the dark figure, and grabbed his collar. The other party was so frightened that he quickly put his hand into his pocket. Li Erjia thought he was reaching for a pistol and immediately pulled his wrist out. The hand was clutching a gold pen and a wad of banknotes. It turned out he was trying to bribe them to release him, which made him even more suspicious. The soldiers asked, "Who are you?" He mumbled incoherently, "A straggler from Liu Kan's reinforcements. Liu Kan is dead, and I was captured and released." When asked his name, he replied, "Zhang..." but hesitated for a moment before uttering "Zhang Yun." When asked what he did, he only admitted to being a "mail clerk." Then he pleaded, "Isn't your Eighth Route Army pursuing a policy of leniency towards prisoners of war?" Li Erjia replied, "Yes, we are lenient. Now, you should come back to the team headquarters with us to clarify things. It won't be too late to release you tomorrow." He remained silent. Feeling his cotton trousers, they were wet up to his thighs. Li Erjia then said, "Your clothes are wet, go back and dry them first." This person of unknown origin was then escorted back.

Upon entering the room, the man pulled the brim of his hat down to his forehead,不敢面向灯光. He appeared to be a small man with a triangular face and a small mustache, wearing a pair of tattered shoes. Li Erjia gave him a pile of firewood, but he only hung his head to dry his trousers. The next day, the prisoners of war gathered, and the man who called himself "Zhang Yun" also came. He dared not look at everyone's eyes, only staring at the top of Qilang Mountain. But the prisoners immediately began to discuss it, and Zhang Hanchu could no longer deceive them.

Zhang Hanchu jumped off the west city wall and fled on the eve of Yichuan's liberation, injuring his waist and left leg. He hid alone in the mountain gully among the withered grass and snow for a day and two nights, only coming out at night, but he was captured as soon as he came out.

　　张汉初被俘经过
    【新华社西北前线十二日电】前线记者报导宜川城守敌二十四旅旅长张汉初被俘经过：
    三日上午解放宜川城的战斗结束后，满城找不到张汉初，据俘虏战士说，他半夜跳城跑了。三日半夜，天特别黑，某部几个战士赶着运粮牲口从城西五里坪往西瓦窑走，忽然前面幌来一个人影，战士李二贾最先看见便喊道：“干啥的？”人影答：“司令部接线的”，声音有些慌张，战士乔福立即抢上前去把枪对准黑影，并一把抓着他的襟领。对方吓得猛把手插进衣袋里，李二贾以为他是摸手枪，立即把他的手腕拉出，那手却捏着一支金杆水笔和一把钞票，原来他企图行贿将他释放，这就更使人怀疑了。战士就问：“你是什么人？”他胡乱吱唔说：“刘戡援军的一个散兵，刘戡死了我被捉住又放出的。”问他姓名，他答道：“张……”，但迟疑了一阵方吐出个“张云”，再问干什么事的，他只承认是“收发”。于是便哀告说：“你们八路军不是宽大政策优待俘虏么？”李二贾回答：“对的，我们是宽大，现在你还是跟我们回队部去问清楚，明天再放你不迟”。他还不吭气，摸他的毛裤已经湿到大腿上面，李二贾便说：“你的衣服湿了先回去烤吧。”这个来历不明的人便被押着往回走。
    一进屋子那人把帽缘拉到额下，不敢面向灯光。看样子，是个小个子，三角脸，两撮小胡，脚上拖着一双破鞋。李二贾抱给他一堆柴，他只垂着头烤裤子。第二天俘虏集合，自称“张云”的人也来了，他不敢看大家的眼睛，只望着七郎山顶。但俘虏们立即议论开了，张汉初再无法欺瞒了。
    张汉初是在宜川解放前夜跳下西城逃跑的，把腰干和左腿跌伤了，他一个人一日两夜躲在山沟里水雪枯草中，晚上才走了出来，但出来就被俘获了。
