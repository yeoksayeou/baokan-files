　　Chiang Bandit Looting Coupled with Natural Disaster
　　Severe Disaster in Anyang
　　30,000 Disaster Victims Have No Food

[Anyang News] In recent years, Anyang has suffered repeated war disasters, coupled with two hailstorms last year. In the villages of the Panliu area of the Eighth District, no grain has been harvested for three seasons. In Shipanliu Village, 51 households with 173 people, paid a total of 1,500 jin of public grain last autumn, and the government relief loans reached 2,500 jin (not including the most recent loan and last year's loans for cotton, grain and wheat seeds). Currently, 70% of the villagers have no food to eat. When the enemy came out to loot, they even took away radish seedlings and bran vegetables. Doors and windows were torn down and burned, and tables, benches, shovels, clothing and bedding were taken away. Many water tanks, pots and bowls were smashed. Currently, in the entire Eighth District, which has 47 villages, 4,119 households, and 14,530 people, plus more than 1,000 refugees who have fled, there are 6,000 disaster victims who will soon have nothing to eat. In the Shuiye District, there are 400 unemployed workers. Last December, when the enemy attacked Shuiye, they looted people's property worth about 40 million yuan. Currently, in addition to those organized into production, there are still more than 1,000 disaster victims in the district. In the Guantai District, since the enemy attacked the coal mine and work stopped in 1946, all the workers have been unemployed. Currently, in addition to those who have opened small coal mines or returned to work elsewhere, there are still 1,006 unemployed workers. According to recent statistics from seven districts in the county (with four districts not yet included), there are a total of 30,000 disaster victims and refugees who have fled who currently have no food to eat and will soon have nothing to eat, and who lack capital. The Anyang government has requested instructions from the commissioner's office and the administrative office, requesting relief in the form of grain loans, cotton loans, and cash loans, in order to organize disaster victims to produce and overcome the famine.
