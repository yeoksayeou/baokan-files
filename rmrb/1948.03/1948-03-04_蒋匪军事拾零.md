　　Snippets of Chiang Kai-shek's Military Affairs

　　△The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reported on the 27th: High-ranking Chiang Kai-shek officers admitted that the morale of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the Northeast was very low. Although the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the Northeast had recently been replenished, they were still defeated.
　　△Starting from the 23rd, Chennault's airline of the United States sent six planes daily to Shenyang to evacuate American personnel; American imperialist military observers in Nanjing lamented that the situation in "Shenyang" (Chiang Kai-shek's forces) was extremely dangerous and rapidly approaching a state of despair (Associated Press).
　　△Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit leader, flew to Guling on February 8th to spend the New Year, and hurriedly flew back to Nanjing on the 26th. Foreign news agencies said that Chiang Kai-shek was extremely "depressed," and during his stay in Guling, the military and economic crises of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had deteriorated severely.
　　△The New York Herald Tribune, a Republican newspaper in the United States, commented on the 25th on the proposal of Taft and his ilk to provide military aid to Chiang Kai-shek to help Chiang Kai-shek's bandits struggle in the Northeast, and had to admit: "The unfortunate (?) situation in the Northeast is not due to the lack of American aid. The troops that the Nanjing government transferred to the Northeast to 'take over' after the war were equipped with the best American equipment. But all this power was wasted."

　　蒋匪军事拾零
    △沪大公报二十七日载：蒋匪高级官员承认东北蒋匪军士气已非常低落，不久前东北蒋军已获补充，但仍打败仗。
    △美国陈纳德航空公司廿三日起每日以六架飞机飞赴沈阳撤退美帝人员；南京美帝军事观察家哀鸣“沈阳”（蒋匪）局势极端危险，且迅速逼向绝望境地（美联社）。
    △匪首蒋介石二月八日飞牯岭渡岁，二十六日已匆忙飞返南京，外国交通社称：蒋贼极为“苦闷”，在其寓牯时间内，蒋匪军事、经济危机均已极度恶化。
    △美国共和党的纽约先驱论坛报，廿五日在评论塔虎脱之流主张军事援蒋帮助蒋匪在东北垂死挣扎时，不得不承认：“东北的不幸（？）形势，并不是由于缺乏美国援助的结果。战后南京政府调去‘接收’东北的军队，都有最优良的美式装备。但这一切力量都浪费了。”
