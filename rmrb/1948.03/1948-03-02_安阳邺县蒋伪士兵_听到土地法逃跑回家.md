[Taihang News] During the powerful political offensive launched in Ye County and Anyang around the Lunar New Year, the Land Law and policies towards puppet soldiers were extensively promoted to Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army and their families, greatly touching their hearts. From the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month of last year to the 10th day of the first lunar month of this year, within twenty days, 52 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers, 190 fleeing landlords, and deceived masses have been won over. Twenty-seven Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers were won over in Ye County, one of whom brought a rifle and forty-five bullets. Many soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division have families in our liberated areas. Hearing that this land redistribution was the last one, and there would be no more redistribution afterward, they secretly discussed, "If we want to go back, we have to go back early, or we won't be able to catch up with the land distribution." One soldier in a village in the third district of Ye County initially didn't believe in our policy. He said, "I'll go back and try it out first. If it doesn't work, I'll leave again!" After returning to the village, the masses treated him very well and told him that if he came back, he could get a share of land. He was extremely happy and immediately sneaked back to the 40th Division and called back three others. In addition, several others contacted us. After hearing about our Land Law, the families of the puppet soldiers launched a movement of fathers calling sons, wives calling husbands, and sons calling fathers to return home. One village in the third district of Ye County called back eleven people. An old man in his forties in a village in the fourth district heard about the Land Law and said, "I can't let my child be a puppet soldier anymore." The next day, he went to Zhangde City, found his child, and gave him a lecture. Three or four days later, his child mobilized three other soldiers to run back together. In order to better win over puppet soldiers to return home, the leadership of Ye County also established "Reception Centers for Chiang's Army Deserters" in the border areas of each district to accommodate returning soldiers. At the same time, in order to prevent traitor Wang Ziquan from killing the returned puppet soldiers and their families, the government helped them move their families to safe old liberated areas. In addition, all teachers in Anyang County, in addition to promoting the Land Law in the core areas, now have a unit accompanying the armed work teams of each district to promote it deep into the Chiang-occupied areas. One team wrote sixteen land reform slogans in Xiaotun Village in the Chiang-occupied area overnight, which had a great impact. In Anyang alone, since February 1st, in less than a month, 170 fleeing landlords and masses, as well as 25 puppet soldiers, have been won over.

[Our Newspaper News] A unit of the militia reconnaissance team in the sixth district of Ye County, on the nights of the 11th and 13th of last month, went deep into the enemy-occupied × village to carry out political offensive propaganda and distribute the Land Law Outline and publicity materials. The reactionary secret society and puppet township government in that village were destroyed by us last time. The masses realized that joining the secret society would help the enemy to seize grain and conscript soldiers, harming themselves, so they were unwilling to participate. However, recently, the enemy has been doing everything possible to deceive them and forced the restoration of the secret society organization. After being established for less than five days, due to our continuous armed activities and the launch of the political offensive, the masses were greatly inspired. The next day, they automatically cancelled the village sentry posts, and the secret society was also disbanded. (Ye County Small Newspaper)

　　安阳邺县蒋伪士兵
  　听到土地法逃跑回家
    【太行消息】邺县、安阳在旧历年前后发动的强大政治攻势中，向蒋伪军和他们的家属深入宣传土地法和对伪军政策，大大打动了他们的心，从去年腊月二十到今年正月初十二十天内，已争取回蒋伪士兵五十二名及逃亡地主和被骗群众一百九十余人。邺县争取回来的蒋匪士兵是二十七名，有一名带来长枪一支和四十五粒子弹。蒋匪四十师的很多士兵家在咱们解放区，他们听说这次平分土地是最后一次，以后再不分了，就暗地议论说：“要回就得早些，再迟了就赶不上分地了。”邺县三区某村一个士兵开初还不相信咱们的政策，他说：“我先回去试试，不行了再走！”回到村后群众对他很好，并给他说你要回来就可以分一份地，他高兴极了，马上又偷偷跑回四十师叫回三个来，另外又有好几个和我们接了头。伪属们听了我们土地法后，更展开了父叫子、妻叫夫、子叫父的返乡运动，邺县三区有一个村叫回十一个来，四区某村一个四十多岁的老汉听了土地法后说：“我可不叫俺孩干伪军了。”第二天他进了彰德城，找见他孩子说了一顿，隔了三四天，他孩子又动员了三个当兵的一齐跑回来了。邺县领导上为更好的争取伪军返乡，又在各区边沿地方成立了“蒋军逃亡官兵招待所”，收容归来的士兵。同时为了防止汉奸王自全杀害已经回来的伪军和伪属，政府帮助他们将家转移到安全的老解放区内。此外，安阳全县教员除在腹心区宣传土地法外，现已有一部随各区武工队深入蒋占区宣传，有一个小组到蒋占区小屯村一夜写了十六条土改标语，影响很大，仅安阳从二月一日以来，不到一月功夫，便争取回一百七十个逃亡地主和群众，还有二十五名伪军。
    【本报消息】邺县六区民兵侦察队一部，于上月十一、十三两日夜间，曾深入到敌后×村，展开政攻宣传，散发土地法大纲及宣传品。原该村之反动会门及伪乡公所，前次经我摧垮后，群众认识到在会门是帮助敌人抢粮抢丁损害自己，都不愿参加了，但最近敌人百般愚弄，又强迫恢复会门组织，刚成立不到五天，由于我之武装不断活动，及政攻的开展给予群众以莫大奋兴，第二天即自动把该村岗哨取销，会门也解散了。（邺县小报）
