Editor's Note: On February 12th, this newspaper published on page two the investigative report by Comrades Wang Peizhang and two others from Qian Berlin Village, Seventh District, Wu'an. This included opinions from the masses regarding Comrade Guo Benxian, a cadre from their village working elsewhere. After studying land reform at the district committee, Guo recognized his mistakes and earnestly reflected on them. This material was submitted by the Tangyin County Committee to the Fifth District Committee, which forwarded it to this newspaper, with a note saying that if the masses of Qian Berlin had any further opinions on Guo's reflection, they could raise them for Comrade Guo to answer. The following is Comrade Guo Benxian's reflection:

　　My name is Guo Benxian, and I am from Qian Berlin Village, Wu'an. I am currently the district head of the First District of Tangyin. The People's Daily's exposure on February 12th of my opposition to land reform and oppression of the masses is a just cry from the masses. I sincerely accept it, bravely admit my mistakes, and am determined to change my stance.

　　Last spring, I was working at the Commissioner's Office. In April, I received a letter from home saying that the masses wanted to raise opinions about my family. After reading the letter, I flew into a rage, thinking that the village was engaging in reckless and chaotic struggle. I thought I was a veteran cadre, had contributed to the leadership struggle in the village, and was a newly wealthy household when the Eighth Route Army arrived. I shouldn't be struggled against. Without any self-criticism, I colluded with my family to oppose the liberation of the poor and hired peasants. After a few days, I asked for leave and went back, working with the village cadres to convene a mass meeting. There was a table and chairs on the stage. The poor and hired peasants were below the stage, and I was both on the stage and the target of struggle. I was arrogant and completely looked down on the masses. Among them, there was a poor peasant named Liu Youjin. In the past, the landlord Li Laoguo wanted to buy a sheep from my family. My father didn't want to sell it. The landlord Li Laoguo sent Liu Youjin to herd it, but he wouldn't let him, and Liu Youjin and I fought. I cried and complained to my father, and my father beat Liu Youjin. Because of this, we had a lawsuit with the landlord, which we lost. My father was beaten with forty hand boards. Since then, I harbored hatred for both the landlord Li Laoguo and Liu Youjin. At the meeting, Comrade Liu Youjin brought up that my father had beaten him. I couldn't separate class lines and cursed Liu Youjin as "bomb-skin," saying his criticism was incorrect. I used my power to suppress the poor and hired peasants, forgetting that I was a revolutionary cadre, and engaging in counter-revolutionary behavior. I didn't understand that Liu Youjin in the past was not conscious and was used by the landlord. The crime was with the landlord. My father was wrong to beat Liu Youjin. Liu Youjin's opinion was correct. We should sincerely criticize ourselves and unite to deal with the landlord. Because of my arrogant landlord stance, I attacked the poor and hired peasants in public. As a result, the masses dispersed in an uproar. From then on, I left a sin on myself among the masses. The year before last, in the first month, when I went home and was about to leave, more than a dozen cadres and masses saw me off for half a mile. Although there was sectarian sentiment, it showed that I still had some connection with the masses. Last winter, when I transported grain to Wu'an and returned home, the masses looked at me differently, and no one even saw me off, indicating that I was seriously detached from the masses.

　　In the past, I thought that the masses giving my family opinions was reckless and chaotic struggle. Now it seems that my past view was wrong. Although my family started from labor, around the 20th year of the Republic of China, we had used sheep herders for five years. The sheep herders ate cold rice year-round, slept in the wilderness, were exposed to wind and rain, and fought with wolves. Their lives were extremely painful. This debt of sweat should be settled. Before the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, my family had debts of 320 yuan because of buying land, building houses, and burying my father (including 80 yuan with an annual interest of 1.6 dou of grain, and the remaining 260 yuan with an annual interest of 82.6 yuan); in addition, we rented six mu of land with an annual rent of 1.8 dou (rent reduction of 40% could reduce 0.45 dou). As a result, I couldn't make ends meet. After the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, I turned over thanks to rent reduction and debt liquidation. In 1943, during the famine, I was a village cadre with half-supply, receiving 30 jin of millet a month. The poor and hired peasants suffered from hunger, but I benefited from the masses. In addition, my wife spun yarn and wove cloth. Within a year, we bought 11.5 mu of land (totaling 26.25 mu including the previous land), 25 rooms, one donkey, 18 sheep, and a family of four. Because I was not at home and lacked labor, we hired short-term workers, which was actually a new rich peasant lifestyle (according to the correct class division principle, family members of revolutionary personnel who rent out or hire labor to cultivate land due to lack of labor should not be considered exploitation. Whether Comrade Guo Benxian's family's class status is new rich peasant still needs to be studied - Editor). During the land reform, I received goods worth 10,000 yuan and 700 yuan in cash in the name of a cadre's family, which was seizing the fruits of the poor and hired peasants. Regardless of old exploitation, new turn-over, or over-occupation of fruits, I should be struggled against by the masses and consciously take it out and return it to the poor and hired peasants. My family lived a rich peasant life, but I couldn't see that the poor and hired peasants hadn't turned over yet, and I had no mass concept.

　　In the past, I thought I was a veteran cadre and had contributed to the leadership struggle in the village. Now it seems that I joined the peasant association to put on a show, and I actively struggled to avenge my grievances. After defeating my own enemies, I became passive and unwilling to do anything, letting others take the lead. When struggling against ordinary landlords, I pleaded for them from the sidelines without firmness. After becoming the village head, I messed around with women. Two landlords gave that bad woman 15,000 yuan to buy me off. I lost my stance and treated them leniently during the struggle, not allowing people to hang their women and protecting the landlords. In 1943, Liu Gui's wife (a poor peasant) stole some grain from the landlord. After listening to the landlord's report, I not only did not pity the poor peasant and strike the landlord, but instead hung my class sister with a rope, doing things for the landlord. Another poor peasant, Li Kuifang, stole other people's crops, and I sent him to the judicial section where he stayed for several months and developed scabies all over his body. I suppressed the poor and hired peasants with an administrative command style, lacking class consciousness. The so-called veteran cadre was only eating the masses' food and doing things for myself, oppressing the poor and hired peasants. Not only did I have no merit, but I also had sins.

　　Recently, I have been studying at the district committee, reflecting on my erroneous thoughts and behaviors, and realizing that in the past, my revolution was for myself and I had no class concept. As a result, I did many things that were sorry to the masses, oppressed the poor and hired peasants, and harmed the revolution, which is very painful. Now I have made a fragmentary preliminary self-criticism. I hope the elders of Berlin Village will give me more opinions to help me correct my mistakes. In the future, when I have time from work, I will also ask for leave to return to the village to admit my mistakes; persuade my family to hand it over to the peasant association for handling according to the Land Law Outline. I completely support it without wavering.

### 接受前柏林群众意见　郭本贤同志反省认错

专栏：

　　接受前柏林群众意见
  　郭本贤同志反省认错
    编者按：二月十二日本报二版刊载了王裴璋等三同志在武安七区前柏林村的调查材料，其中有一段群众对他村在外当干部的郭本贤同志提的意见，郭在地委处经过土改学习，认识了自己的错误，作了认真的反省。这材料由汤阴县委交五地委转寄本报，地委并附信说前柏林群众对郭的反省有啥意见，还可提出来让郭同志答复。下面是郭本贤同志的反省：
    我叫郭本贤，是武安前柏林村人，现在汤阴一区做区长。人民日报二月十二号揭露了我反对土改欺压群众的消息，这是群众的正义呼声，我诚恳接受并勇敢认错，决心改变自己的立场。
    去年春我在专署工作，四月间接到家信一封，说群众要提我家意见，看信后我大发脾气，认为村上是胡搞乱斗，我是多年老干部，在村领导斗争有功，八路军来到我是新发户，不应该斗争我，毫不检讨自己，和家庭勾结起来反对贫雇翻身。隔了几天，我请假回去了，协同村干部召开了个群众大会，台子上放有桌和椅，贫雇在台下我在台上，又当记录又是斗争对象，自高自大根本看不起群众。其中有个贫雇叫刘有金，过去地主李老国要买我家一只羊，我父不愿意，地主李老国差刘有金去赶，不让赶，刘有金和我打了一顿，我哭告我父亲，我父亲把刘有金打了一顿，为此和地主打过官司，打的失败了，我父亲挨过四十个手板，从此对地主李老国和刘有金都记下仇恨。会上刘有金同志提出我父亲打过他，我分不开阶级，大骂刘有金是炸弹皮，提的不正确，以势打击贫雇，忘记了自己是一个革命干部，做出反革命的行为。不了解刘有金在过去不觉悟为地主利用，罪恶在地主，我父亲打刘有金是不对的，刘有金的意见是正确的，应当诚恳检讨团结起来对付地主才对。由于我自高自大地主立场，当众面前打击贫雇，因之群众一轰而散，从此在群众中落下了罪恶。前年正月回家，临走时，干部群众十多人送我有半里远，虽然有宗派情绪，但说明还连系一点群众。去年冬季往武安运粮，回家一趟，群众则别眼看待，连一个人都没送行，说明我严重的脱离了群众。
    过去我认为群众给我家提意见是胡搞乱斗，现在看来过去的看法是错误的，我家虽然是劳动起家，但在民国廿年左右曾经用过五年羊工，羊工常年吃的是冷饭，睡的是野外，风吹雨洒和狼打架，生活是极其痛苦的。这一笔汗帐，应当清算，八路军未来以前，我家因为买地修房出殡父亲，负下外债三百廿元（其中有八十块钱，年利一石六斗谷，其余二百六十块钱，年利八十二元六角）；另外租入土地六亩，年租一石八斗（四一减租可以减四斗半），因之，压的我过不了时光。八路军来了后，减租清债我算翻了身。四三年灾荒我当村干部半供给，一月领三十斤小米，贫雇受饿我沾了群众的光，加之老婆纺花织布，一年内买地十一亩半（连以前土地共二十六亩四分），房二十五间，驴一头，羊十八只，人四口，因我不在家缺劳力，雇用短工，实际上是个新富农生活（按正确划阶级原则，革命职员家属，因没有或缺少劳力而出租或雇工耕种土地者，不得认为剥削行为。郭本贤同志家庭成份是否新富农，尚需研究——编者）。在土改中以干属名义分过价值一万元的东西和七百元钱，是夺取贫雇果实，不论旧剥削新翻身和多占果实，都应该受到群众的斗争，自觉拿出来退还贫雇，自己家过富农生活，贫雇还没翻了身，自己亦看不见，毫无群众观念。
    过去认为我是老干部，在村领导斗争有功，现在看来参加农会是为了顶门市，斗争积极是为了报仇冤，打倒自己敌人就消极不干，让别人出头，斗争一般地主，从旁说情不坚决。当了村长后搞女人，曾有两个地主给过那个坏女人一万五千块钱收买了我，丧失立场，斗争时从轻处理，不让吊人家女人，包庇地主。四三年刘桂的女人（贫雇）偷了地主一些粮食，听了地主的报告，自己不但不可怜贫雇打击地主，反而把阶级姊妹吊了一绳，为地主办了事。另一个贫雇李奎方偷了人家庄稼，把他送到司法科住了好几个月，生了一身疥。压制贫雇行政命令作风，没有阶级性，所谓老干部亦仅是吃上群众的饭给自己办事，欺压贫雇，不但没功劳，而且有罪恶。
    最近我在地委学习，反省了自己错误思想与行为，认识了过去革命为自己，没有阶级观念。因之办了好多对不起群众的事情，欺压了贫雇，危害了革命，是十分痛心的。现在我作了片断的初步检讨，希望柏林村父老多给我提意见，帮助我改正错误，将来工作有暇时，还准备请假回村承认错误；劝说我的家庭，交与农会按土地法大纲处理，我是完全拥护毫不动摇的。
