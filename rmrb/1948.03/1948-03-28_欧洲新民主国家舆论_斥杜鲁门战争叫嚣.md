　　European New Democratic Countries' Public Opinion
  　Condemns Truman's Warmongering
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 25th: TASS reports that public opinion in the new democratic countries is sharply criticizing Truman's speech. The Yugoslav News Agency stated: Truman's speech confirms once again that the American rulers are militarizing the country and pursuing a policy of persecuting freedom-loving countries, attempting to destroy the powerful movement of various countries striving for peace and democracy. The agency, pointing out that the struggles of the people of France, Italy, Greece, China, Spain, and Britain for independence, democracy, and freedom are growing stronger day by day, said that the Chinese people are liberating their country from the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government and American imperialist interference, and pointed out that the European people will not be deceived by American "aid." The Polish Workers' Daily pointed out that the purpose of Truman's speech is to create so-called war mania and influence American public opinion to support Washington's current policies, taking the opportunity to force through laws that the people do not want. The Hungarian *Szava* newspaper said that Truman's new methods will not achieve anything at home or abroad. The Soviet Union and its allies – the People's Democracies – are leading 300 million people towards the road of national independence, becoming a model for peace-loving policies worldwide.

　　欧洲新民主国家舆论
  　斥杜鲁门战争叫嚣
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社报导：新民主国家舆论均尖锐抨击杜鲁门的演说。南斯拉夫通讯社称：杜氏演说再此证实美国统治者正使该国军国主义化；并奉行迫害爱好自由国家的政策，企图摧毁各国争取和平民主的强大运动。该社在指出法、意、希、中国、西班牙、英国、国人民争取独立民主自由的斗争，都正在日益强大时说：中国人民正在从国民党反动政府的统治及美帝干涉下解放其国家，并指出：欧洲人民不会受美国“援助”的欺骗。波兰工人报指出：杜氏演说的目的，在于造成所谓战争狂，并影响美国舆论，使它赞成华盛顿的现行政策，乘机强行通过人民所不愿的法律。匈牙利斯查瓦报说：杜鲁门的新办法，在国内外决不会有什么成就，苏联及其同盟者——人民民主国家，领导着三万万人民向着国家独立的大道迈进，成为全世界爱好和平政策的范例。
