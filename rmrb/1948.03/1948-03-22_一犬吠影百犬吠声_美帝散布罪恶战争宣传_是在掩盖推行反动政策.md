Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Comprehensive report: The reactionary American government has been employing shameless intimidation tactics in recent days, manufacturing war panic and deceptive propaganda about an imminent international crisis. It is attempting to use this to salvage the continued implementation of its increasingly bankrupt reactionary policies. This conspiracy has been widely condemned by the American people. Since Marshall's declaration on the 10th that "the world situation is extremely serious," U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal convened a joint staff meeting on "new military deployments" in Key West, Florida, on the 11th. Truman convened a cabinet meeting on the 13th to discuss the "international emergency situation." On the same day, warmonger Byrnes also issued the rabid cry that "a world crisis may arrive within the next four or five weeks." Immediately, the entire American reactionary press and radio stations followed suit, "one dog barking at a shadow, a hundred dogs barking in response," spreading their sinister war propaganda. In a letter to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on the 17th, Wallace revealed that this propaganda by the Truman government was used to "cover up the failure of his own policies."

The *Daily Worker* revealed that the "war propaganda" is a major part of the plan of the Forrestal group (including Harriman, Lovett, and Leahy). Its purpose is to suppress the anti-military sentiment among the domestic population, intimidate Wallace's supporters, prepare for the suppression of the Communist Party, force the rapid passage of the European Recovery Program, and form an anti-Soviet military alliance to prevent progressive forces in Italy from winning the election. Even the *New York World-Telegram* had to admit that "there is no fundamental change in the international situation," and the government's recent "talk of war" is merely to get Congress to support reactionary policies that have already proven to be a failure.

The reactionary forces themselves have punctured this paper tiger of the American government, confessing that this propaganda is only for achieving other goals. Byrnes is "deliberately making alarming statements." Even Taft said, "He does not believe in the talk of war."

      一犬吠影百犬吠声
   　美帝散布罪恶战争宣传
   　是在掩盖推行反动政策
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合报导：美反动政府连日来采取无耻的恫吓手段，制造战争惊慌与国际情势危急的欺骗宣传。妄图借此挽救其日益破产的反动政策的继续推行，此一阴谋已受到美国人民广泛的斥责。自马歇尔十日扬言“世界局势极其严重”之后，美国防部长福莱斯特尔十一日在佛罗里达州的基聿斯特，召开了“军事新布署”的联合参谋会议，杜鲁门十三日召开了讨论“国际危急局势”的内阁会议，同日战贩贝纳斯又发出“世界危机可能于今后四五周内到来”的狂吠，一时美国全体反动报纸和广播台就跟着“一犬吠影百犬吠声”，散布其罪恶的战争宣传。华莱士十七日致参众两院军委会的信中，曾揭露杜鲁门政府的这种宣传，是用来“掩盖他自己政策的失败”。
    美工人日报揭露“战争宣传”是福莱斯特尔集团（包括哈立曼、罗维特、李海）计划的主要部分。其目的在于镇压国内人民反军人的情绪，恫吓华莱士的拥护者，为镇压共产党作准备，压迫援欧计划的迅速通过，并缔结反苏军事同盟与防止意大利进步势力在选举中获胜。甚至美国新社亦不得不承认：“国际形势并无基本变化”，政府近来之“大谈战争”，不过是为了使国会支持已经证明失败了的反动政策。
    美政府这种纸老虎，反动派自己亦把它戳穿了，他们纷纷自供这种宣传不过是为了达到另外的目的，贝纳斯是“故作惊人之论”。甚至塔虎脱也说：“他不相信战争的谈论”。
