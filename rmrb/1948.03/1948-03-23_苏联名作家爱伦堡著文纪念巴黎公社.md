Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Moscow dispatch: March 18th is the 77th anniversary of the Paris Commune. The newspaper *Pravda* published an article by the renowned writer Ehrenburg to commemorate the event. Ehrenburg wrote: When the whole of France was under the enemy's iron heel, when the Nazi beasts were trampling on the sacred land of Paris, it was our people who saved the banner of the Paris Commune, preventing it from being stained by the German invaders; it was the defenders of Moscow who defended the dignity of the people of Paris. For us, France is neither a market nor a raw material, nor a military base nor mercenaries. For us, France is only the nation of the Paris Commune, and we know it will be victorious! (Note: On March 18, 1871, the Paris proletariat raised the banner of uprising, resisting the traitorous elements of Versailles internally and the invasion of Bismarck's German invaders externally, establishing the first proletarian dictatorship in world history. Besieged by internal and external enemies, the heroic Paris Commune lasted for 47 days, writing a glorious and brilliant page for the French and world proletariat.)

    苏联名作家爱伦堡著文纪念巴黎公社
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：三月十八日为巴黎公社七十七周年纪念，真理报刊载名作家爱伦堡一文，表示纪念。爱氏写道：当整个法兰西处在敌人的铁蹄下，当纳粹野兽践踏着巴黎神圣的土地时，是我国人民拯救了巴黎公社的旗帜，使其不为德寇所沾污；是莫斯科的保卫者保卫了巴黎人民的尊严。对于我们，法兰西既不是市场或原料，亦不是军事基地或雇佣兵。对于我们，法兰西只是巴黎公社的国家，我们深知它将获得胜利！（按一八七一年三月十八日巴黎无产阶级曾举起义旗，内抗凡尔赛的卖国贼，外抗俾斯麦德寇的入侵，在世界史上第一次建立起无产阶级专政的国家。在内外敌人夹击下，英勇的巴黎公社曾支持四十七天之久，为法国的及世界的无产阶级写了光荣灿烂的一页。）
