　　Peking University Agricultural College
  　Promotes Spring Plowing at Lantern Festival
    [Changzhi News] This year's Lantern Festival in Changzhi City was very lively. Among the many Yangko teams, the spring plowing propaganda team of Peking University Agricultural College was the most eye-catching. They carried various new agricultural tools, large sugar beets, and red and white bran, performing rhythmic storytelling and other acts. They also explained to the masses the functions of various new agricultural tools in saving labor, intensive farming, and increasing yields. These included eight types such as hillside plows, seeders, weeding tools, and harvesters, among which seeders and weeding tools were the most popular among the masses. People watching the festivities said, "The agricultural team is the best performer."

　　北大农学院
  　元宵宣传春耕
    【长治消息】今年长治市的元宵节很热闹。在很多秧歌队中，要以北大农学院的春耕宣传队最使人注意。他们背着各种各样的新农具，很大的糖萝葡，又带着红白砂糠，说唱快板等。并向群众解释各种新农具的功用，在于省工，精耕，增加产量。计有山地犁、播种器、锄草器、收获器等八种，内中以播撒器、锄草器、最受群众欢迎。看红火的人都说：“数农业队玩得好”。
