Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 8th: New York—On the 28th of last month, the Security Council, with a majority of seven votes (the US, UK, France, Belgium, Chiang, Argentina, and Canada), passed a reactionary proposal that infringes upon Indonesia. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Colombia, and Syria abstained. This is clearly the result of the US imperialist-controlled Tripartite Mediation Committee supporting Dutch aggression demands. The proposal was put forward by the US imperialist lackey, the Canadian reactionaries, and in addition to approving the Tripartite Mediation Committee's conspiracy to assist Dutch aggression, it also demands that the committee continue to assist in implementing the "Renville" agreement, which is unfavorable to the Indonesian people, forcing the Republic of Indonesia to cede large tracts of territory to the Netherlands.

　　安理会通过
  　侵害印尼提案
    【新华社陕北八日电】纽约讯：安理会上月二十八日以七票（美、英、法、比、蒋、阿根廷和加拿大）多数，通过了侵害印尼的反动提案，苏联、乌克兰、哥伦比亚和叙利亚四国弃权。这显然是美帝国主义控制下的三国调停委员会支持荷兰侵略要求的结果。该提案系由美帝走狗加拿大反动派所提出，除批准三国调委会助荷侵略的阴谋活动外，并要求该委员会继续协助施行不利于印尼人民的“伦维尔”协定，迫使印尼共和国向荷兰割让大块领土。
