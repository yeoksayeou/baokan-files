Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. A dispatch from the U.S. Imperialist Associated Press in Nanjing on the 25th reveals that Chiang and the U.S. are colluding to delay the peace treaty with Japan in order to fully assist Japan's economic recovery and make Japan a world aggressor again. Chiang Kai-shek's official sources admit that in order to "be consistent with U.S. policy" on general attitudes toward Japan, especially on the issue of the peace treaty, they have decided to abandon the so-called "early resolution of the Japanese issue." The Chiang government believes that "a peace treaty is not as important as Japan's economic recovery" and insanely advocates for Japan to recover to the point of being "able to participate in the policy of containing global communists." Therefore, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are particularly "satisfied" with MacArthur's policy of cultivating Japanese aggressive forces, and announced that they have "accepted the American proposal to determine Japan's industrial level according to the average standard of 1930 to 1934."

　　蒋美拖延对日和约
  　培养日本侵略势力
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据美帝合众社南京二十五日消息披露：蒋美勾结拖延对日和约，以便全力协助日本经济复兴，使日本重新成为世界侵略者。蒋匪官方人士供认：为了在对日一般态度特别是对日和约问题上“与美国政策一致”，已决定放弃所谓“早日解决日本问题”的办法。蒋政府认为“和约比较日本的经济复兴并不重要”，并丧心病狂的主张使日本复兴到“能够参加遏止全球共产党人这一政策”。因此蒋匪对麦克阿瑟培养日本侵略势力的政策特别表示“满意”，宣布已“接受美国建议，按照一九三○年至三四年的平均标准来决定日本工业水平”。
