Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 17th—TASS Moscow reports: After the so-called "civilian" air transport planes of American imperialist Chennault illegally violated the airspace over Lüshun Port on the 8th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Foreign Ministry" distorted the facts to defend its American masters, lodging a protest with the Soviet Union on the 10th. The Soviet Embassy in China replied on the 13th, refuting this protest, stating: The truth of the matter is as follows: On March 8th, an unidentified aircraft violated the airspace over Lüshun Port. Two Soviet patrol planes were scrambled and used signals to order the aircraft to land. However, after the Soviet planes issued signals multiple times, the aircraft ignored them. The Soviet planes then fired warning shots, but did not shoot it down. The reply concluded: This protest is groundless and the Soviet government finds it difficult to accept.

　　美机违法侵犯旅顺领空
    苏联驳斥蒋匪无理抗议
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：美帝陈纳德的所谓民用空运大队飞机，于八日违法侵犯旅顺港领空后，蒋匪外交部复歪曲事实，为其美国主子辩护，于十日向苏联提出抗议，苏驻华大使馆于十三日复文曾予驳斥，内称：此一事实真相如下：三月八日有来历不明的飞机一架侵犯旅顺港领空，苏联巡逻机两架因此起飞用符号要求该机就地降落，讵苏机发出符号多次后，该机仍置之不理，苏机乃鸣枪警告，但并未加以射击。复文结尾指出：此一抗议毫无根据，苏联政府碍难接受。
