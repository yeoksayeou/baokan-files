Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th: The Huangjiachuan Village, in the Third District of Yihe Township, Suide County, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, used crop yield as a standard in land redistribution, meeting the land requirements of poor peasants and hired laborers while firmly uniting with the middle peasants.

　　The village has a total of 75 households and 333 people. During the civil war, it was a guerrilla zone, and land had not been distributed. In 1940, a "land consolidation" was carried out (i.e., the farmers' association distributed landlord land to farmers for cultivation, with a 50% reduction in rent, a form of permanent tenancy). Last spring, a more thorough land reform was conducted, distributing the surplus land of landlords to landless and land-poor peasants according to population, eliminating landless households. Before this redistribution, the village had three landlord households with 24 people, averaging 1.63 *xiang* and *dui* of land per person (in this area, one *xiang* is eight *dui*, about three acres). There were 31 poor peasant and hired labor households, with 113 people, averaging 1.64 *xiang* and *dui* of land per person. There were five well-to-do middle peasant households, with 32 people, averaging 2.5 *xiang* of land per person. There were 36 middle peasant households, with 164 people, averaging slightly more than 2.5 *xiang* of land per person. From a quantitative perspective, the land problem had been basically resolved. Therefore, at the start of the movement, poor peasants and hired laborers, eager to obtain the landlords' grain and floating assets, initially believed "land hadn't been divided properly." The work team also lacked clarity, only examining the quantity of land and feeling that equal division would be difficult, as only one landlord's land could be drawn from the three landlord households, while at least 20 middle peasant households would be affected, and even eight poor peasant households. This posed problems for meeting the needs of poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants. Later, after mobilizing the masses for in-depth land registration and investigation, they started by forming a land group with two members of the farmers' association and five impartial peasants familiar with the land situation. They convened 20 to 30 people daily to register households one by one. First, the individual reported in person, with everyone helping to calculate, and the registration and review were conducted on the spot, and finally submitted to a village-wide meeting for review. After three repeated deliberations by the masses, it was discovered that not only was there good and bad mountain land, but there was also good and bad riverbank garden land, as well as differences between distant and nearby land. At the same time, they discovered a considerable amount of public land, cooperative land, and land of childless deceased, as well as unfair distribution in the land reform last spring, such as turning mortgaged land into permanently transferred land, with two households gaining more than four and a half times the land. Through such precise calculations, they discovered that the crop yields of each class differed greatly. For example, the average yield per person for landlords was 9.8 *dou*, for well-to-do middle peasants it was 8.4 *dou*, for middle peasants it was 6.8 *dou*, and for poor peasants and hired laborers it was only 6.6 *dou*. Over 70% of the landlords' land was good or relatively good land; 52% of the poor peasants' and hired laborers' land was poor land, and 18% was relatively poor land. Five households cultivated entirely the worst and relatively poor land, six households had over 90% of the worst land, nine households had no gardens, and nine households had too few gardens; among middle peasants, seven households had over 90% poor and relatively poor land, and eight households had no gardens or too few gardens. However, one landlord household of seven people owned 160 garden ridges (about four *dui*), and one well-to-do middle peasant household occupied one-sixth of the village's garden land.

　　This calculation greatly enlightened the poor peasants and hired laborers. When they began to gain strength, they bravely struggled against the landlords with great momentum. The work team supported them. At this time, the middle peasants superficially agreed to a thorough redistribution. But when they all joined the farmers' association and brought down the landlords and approached the distribution, some middle peasants with surplus land expressed: "Thorough redistribution is right, but it's not easy to do." Middle peasant Huang Xianchang said: "If our land is taken, we'll be bums next year." These reflections prompted the work team to carefully study the thoughts of the middle peasants. They visited households one by one, encouraged them to speak their minds, and held separate meetings for them to talk about their concerns and grievances. They slowly discovered that the middle peasants who originally completely agreed with the thorough redistribution actually had various concerns, such as: (1) fear of disturbing grave plots and land reserved for old age; (2) fear of dividing ancestral property; (3) fear of dividing land into small plots; (4) unwillingness to move land for those who worked well and farmed well. In response to this situation, the work team quickly explained the land redistribution method, clarified that adjusting land was not disrupting all land and dividing it equally, and from abolishing debts, reducing the burden on middle peasants, consolidating the border region, and defeating Chiang Kai-shek, encouraged them to help poor peasants and hired laborers to turn over. At the same time, they strengthened the propaganda among the poor peasants and hired laborers on the importance of uniting with the middle peasants, making them understand how to lead the middle peasants while also knowing how to make concessions to them. After holding separate heart-to-heart talks with both sides, they held a joint general meeting. They repeatedly explained and discussed the two basic principles of land reform: meeting the requirements of poor peasants and hired laborers, and uniting with middle peasants. Finally, they jointly discussed how to distribute land in the village. After such in-depth discussions between the two sides, the middle peasants automatically "welcomed" (i.e., voluntarily offered) land. For example, Huang Dengtang owed a lot of debts in the old society, but turned over because the revolution abolished debts. In recent years, he had accumulated some new debts, which were abolished again this time. He said: "I have been maintained as a middle peasant twice by the revolution. I know the suffering of the poor. I am willing to welcome out my surplus gardens and mountain land to help my poor brothers to turn over." In this way, 17 middle peasant households "welcomed" out 37 *xiang* of land. However, middle peasants Huang Xianchang and Huang Xianzeng, who had surplus land, remained silent. Poor peasant Huang Weizhi, who had gardens, riverbank land, and good mountain land, even proposed to divide the gardens. The work team then explained Chairman Mao's opinion on making appropriate concessions to the middle peasants to everyone, and inspired everyone to consider the situation in the village and Chairman Mao's instructions for three days. At that time, the winter production had just begun. From then on, three or twenty people gathered together to spin wool, chat, and argue. Huang Jifu, who had never spoken much, also joined the argument. Everyone criticized Huang Weizhi for being "too selfish," saying "you want to fill a half-jin oil bottle with a jin, and it will overflow." They also criticized Huang Xianzeng, saying: "You only care about yourself and don't care about others." Here they were discussing how to meet the needs, there they were discussing the issue of unity, and discussions were taking place everywhere.

　　In addition, middle peasant Huang Mingliang welcomed the idea of contributing land and then regretted it. The farmers' association allowed him to withdraw his offer. The next day, encouraged by his nephew, he welcomed it out again, and the third day he withdrew it again. Until finally, he thought of the suffering he had endured in the old society, and thought that although he "welcomed" a small amount of land, his nephews and nieces would all be able to obtain land, he then decided to "welcome" it out again. At this point, the village proceeded with land adjustments. After repeated deliberation by the masses, according to the village's average yield and population, and taking care of the poor, elderly, and disabled, they implemented drawing from fertile land to supplement barren land, drawing from surplus land to supplement deficient land. First, they used the landlord's land and public land. When that was not enough, they used the land "welcomed" out by the middle peasants. The accounting was as follows: (1) 17.65 *xiang* were drawn from the landlords' land. (2) 13.7 *xiang* were taken from public land, cooperative land, and land of childless deceased. (3) 5.7 *xiang* were used to rectify land unfairly distributed last spring. (4) Of the 17 middle peasant households that "welcomed" land, land from seven households totaling 17.3 *xiang* was used. The land of the remaining ten households was returned. Huang Pengliang's "welcomed" land was also returned. The seven middle peasant households (five of which were well-to-do middle peasants) that had land taken "welcomed" the move after being allocated the fruits of struggle and adjusting the garden plots. From these four aspects, a total of slightly less than 55 *xiang* of land was drawn. After supplementing the landlord households with 9.7 *xiang* of relatively poor land (another 6.2 *xiang* were exchanged from poor peasants and hired laborers), the remaining land was distributed to 36 households (about 50% of the village's households), totaling 137 people (40% of the village's population), meeting the land requirements of 28 poor peasant and hired labor households and 8 middle peasant households. The entire village (that is, the entire township) basically achieved equalization. The average yield per person for landlords was 6.84 *dou*, for well-to-do middle peasants it was 7.03 *dou*, for middle peasants it was 7 *dou*, and for poor peasants, hired laborers, elderly, and disabled it was 7.6 *dou*. Every household in the village had a garden, and every household had good land. The land of five households, which had been scattered into small plots in last spring's distribution, was now consolidated into large plots. From the beginning to the end of the distribution, it took a total of 21 days (9 days for investigation and registration, 7 days for repeated deliberation and distribution by the masses, and 5 days for public announcement, review, and correction). The masses were all satisfied with this land distribution, saying: "This time it's truly thorough." The poor peasants and hired laborers said: "This time we are truly satisfied." The eight middle peasant households that received 10.2 *xiang* of land had very high enthusiasm for production. Seven families joined together to buy two oxen. Everyone is actively planning seeds and preparing for production. As for the seven middle peasant households whose land was taken, they were allocated fruits of struggle and adjusted garden plots, and their debts were abolished and their burdens were reduced, gaining some and losing some, which did not affect their lives. Therefore, they all unanimously said: "We are sincerely welcoming out this little bit of land."

　　满足贫雇要求又团结了中农
  　黄家川抽补典型经验
    【新华社西北二十八日电】陕甘宁边区绥德县义合区三乡黄家川村按产量为标准以抽补原则，满足了贫雇农的土地要求，并巩固地团结了中农。
    该村共有七十五户、三百三十三口人，内战时为游击区，土地未被分配，一九四○年，进行过一次“并地”（即由农会主持把地主土地分配给农民耕种，租子减一半，是永佃性质），去年春天进行过一次比较彻底的土改，将地主长余土地按人口分给无地少地的农民，消灭无地户，此次抽补前全村三户地主廿四人，每人平均一垧六堆三（按当地一垧为八堆约合三亩）。三十一户贫雇农，一百一十三口人，每人平均一垧六堆四。五户富裕中农，三十二口人，每人平均二垧半。三十六户中农，一百六十四口人，每人平均两垧又半堆。从数量上看，土地问题已基本解决。所以运动开始时，贫雇农因急欲求得地主的粮食和浮财，曾认为“土地没分头”，工作组也并不清楚，只在土地数量上考察了一下，觉得平分发生困难，因三户地主中只能抽一户的土地，而中农却至少要动二十户，贫雇农也要动八户，对满足贫雇及团结中农发生问题。后经发动群众深入的登记土地和调查，开始以农会的两个委员吸收五个熟悉土地情况的公正农民，组成土地小组，每天召集二三十人，逐户登记，先由本人在场报告，众人帮助计算，当场登记及审查通过，最后交全村大会复审。先后经群众三次反复审议，才发现不仅山地有好坏，川园地也有好坏，并有远地近地的差别，同时发现了不少的公地合作社地绝户地，以及去春土改中分配不公的情形，如把典地转为死契地，有两户多得了四倍半土地。经过了这样较精密的计算，发觉各阶层土地产量相差很大。如地主每人平均为九斗八，富裕中农为八斗四，中农为六斗八，贫雇农则只有六斗六。地主的土地，百分之七十以上是好地和较好地；贫雇农的土地百分之五十二是坏地，百分之十八是较坏地，有五户完全种着最下地和较下地，有六户百分之九十以上是最下地，九户没有园子，九户园子太少；中农中有七户百分之九十以上是坏地和较坏地，八户没有园子和园子太少，但一户七口人的地主，则拥有一百六十畦园子（约合四堆），有一户富裕中农占有全村六分之一的园子。
    这一计算结果，大大启发了贫雇农，当开始形成力量时，便勇猛向地主斗争，声势很大。工作组支持了他们，这时中农表面都赞成彻底平分。但当他们都参加了农会，把地主斗倒而接近分配的时候，有些长余土地的中农就表示：“彻底平分对是对，就是不好办”。中农黄宪常说：“如果抽了咱的地，明年要当二流子”。这些反映，促使工作组仔细研究中农的心思，经挨户走访，启发他们说心里话，召集他们单独开会谈心事，诉苦，慢慢的发现原来完全同意彻底平分的中农，实际上都有着种种顾虑，如：（一）怕动了坟地养老地；（二）怕分了祖业地；（三）怕把土地分成小块；（四）劳动好作务好的，不愿意再动。针对这种情形，工作组赶紧解说抽补方法，调剂土地不是打乱一切土地平分，并从废除债务，减轻中农负担，巩固边区以及打垮蒋匪鼓励他们帮助贫雇农翻身。同时加强对贫雇农宣传团结中农的重要，要他们懂得领导中农又懂得向中农让步。两方面单独开了谈心会后，又合在一起开大会。反复解释讨论了土改的两条基本原则：满足贫雇农要求，和团结中农。最后共同商量本村土地如何分配。经过双方这样深入的讨论，引起了中农自动“欢迎”土地（即自动拿出之意），如黄登堂在旧社会时欠了很多债因革命废除债务而翻了身。近几年又欠了些债，这次又废除债务，他说：“我两次靠革命维持了中农，我知道穷人的苦，我愿意把多余的园子和山地欢迎出来帮助穷弟兄翻身”。就这样，有十七户中农“欢迎”出三十七垧地。但地有长余的中农黄宪常、黄宪曾却不开口，贫农黄维治，有园子有川地又有好山地，还提出要分得园子，工作组便又把毛主席对中农要适当让步的意见向大家解释，启发大家根据本村情形和毛主席的指示去酝酿三天。当时正是冬季生产刚刚开始，从此，三二十个人便聚在一起捻毛线，拉谈，争论，从来不多说话的黄继父也参加了争论，大家批评黄维治“太自私”，“你半斤油瓶还要装一斤，就满得溢出来”。又批评黄宪曾说：“只顾自己不管别人”。这里在拉谈满足问题，那里在谈团结问题，到处在谈论。
    另外中农黄明亮欢迎了又后悔，农会允许他撤消，第二天他受他侄子的鼓励又欢迎出来，第三天又撤消。直到最后他想到在旧社会所受的苦处，想到他“欢迎”了少量土地，而他的侄子外甥都能得到土地，才又决心“欢迎”出来。至此，全村进行调剂土地，经群众反复酝酿，按照全村平均产量及人口，并照顾贫苦和老弱残废，实行抽肥补瘦、抽多补少，先动用地主土地，公地，不足时再动用中农“欢迎”出来的土地，计：（一）从地主土地中抽出十七垧六堆半。（二）拿出公地、合作社地、绝户地十三垧七堆。（三）修正去春分配不公之地五垧七堆。（四）“欢迎”土地的十七户中农动用了七户共十七垧三堆。其余十户的土地都退回。黄朋亮“欢迎”的土地也退了回去。动用的七户中农（其中五户为富裕中农）“欢迎”后另分配了斗争果实和调剂了园子，从这四方面共抽出土地五十五垧弱，除补给地主户较下地九垧七堆（另由贫雇换给六垧二堆）外，其余分配给了三十六户（约占全村户数的百分之五十），共一百三十七人（占全村入口的百分之四十），满足了廿八户贫雇农，八户中农的土地要求。全村（也即是全乡）基本上达到拉平。地主每人平均产量六斗八升四，富裕中农七斗零三合，中农七斗，贫雇和老弱残废七斗六升。全村每户都有园子，也都有好地。去春分配中有五户地分散成小块，现也兑成了大块。自开始至分配完，前后共二十一天，（调查登记九天，群众反复酝酿分配七天，公布复审及修正五天。）对这次分配土地，群众都满意的说：“这回才真正彻底了”，贫雇说：“这回真满足了”。八户中农分得土地十垧二堆，生产情绪很高。七家合伙买了两头耕牛，大家都在积极筹划种子准备生产。至于抽动土地的七户中农，另分配了果实及调剂了园子地，并废除债务，减轻负担有失有得，并不影响其生活，所以他们都异口同声的说：“咱们是真心欢迎出这一点地”。
