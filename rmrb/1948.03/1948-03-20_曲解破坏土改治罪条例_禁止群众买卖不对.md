Misinterpreting and Sabotaging the Land Reform Punishment Regulations
　　Prohibiting the Masses from Buying and Selling is Wrong

To the Editorial Board:

　　I am unclear about something. After our Land Law was issued, the masses were very supportive, but the rectification of the ranks to achieve filling the gaps is a meticulous task, and many villages cannot complete it before the spring plowing. Now the masses are mentioning a difficulty: if someone in the family is sick and has no money to buy medicine, they want to sell something, but they are afraid of being said to be violating the Land Law and dare not sell. Some people also say that they want to buy farm tools for spring plowing but cannot because they have no money. They are also afraid to sell anything. The masses also know they are afraid that some bad village cadres are getting too much and fear they will resell it, but some people are indeed in trouble and cannot sell anything. The current difficulty cannot be solved. Can the masses sell things to see a doctor and buy medicine? I am not sure, please answer.

　　(Wang Cunshan, Work Team of the Ninth District of Wu'an)

Since the promulgation of the Land Law, many villages have misinterpreted the spirit of the "Land Reform Punishment Regulations" and arbitrarily prohibit merchants and farmers from free buying and selling. For example, if a farmer cuts down a tree to get a beam for building a house, it becomes "sabotage"; if a family in difficulty sells a few bushels of grain, it also becomes "sabotage." This will create a wrong impression among the masses and cause anxiety, which is very wrong. Places where this phenomenon exists should be quickly checked and corrected. If individual bad elements intentionally sabotage and there is indeed evidence, they can be punished according to the regulations. The general public should have the right to free buying and selling and should not be arbitrarily labeled as "sabotaging."

### 曲解破坏土改治罪条例　禁止群众买卖不对

　　曲解破坏土改治罪条例
  　禁止群众买卖不对编辑同志：
    我现在有一件事不明白，咱们的土地法下来以后，群众都很拥护，但整编队伍实现填补是一个细密的工作，很多村在春耕前完不成。现在群众提到一点困难，如家有个病人，没有钱买药吃，想卖点东西，又怕说是违犯土地法，不敢卖。还有的群众说，要春耕想买点农具也不能买，因没有钱。想卖点东西也不敢。群众也知道怕有些坏村干得的果实高，怕他们倒卖，但有些群众确有困难想卖点东西也不能，目前的困难得不到解决。是不是群众能卖点东西看病买药？我也不明白，请回答。　　（武安九区工作队王存山）
    土地法公布以来，不少村庄，误解“破坏土改治罪条例”的精神，随便禁止商人、农民自由买卖，如农民盖房子用梁砍个树，即成了“破坏”；家中困难卖几斗粮食也成了“破坏”。这样会造成群众错觉引起不安，这是很不对的。有此现象的地方，应快检查纠正，如个别坏分子有意破坏确实有据者，可依条例治罪，一般群众应有自由买卖之权，不能随便戴上“破坏”的帽子。
