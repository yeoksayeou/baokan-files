　　Important Correction
    A letter from the Zhao Zhuang work group pointed out that in the "Reader-Editor Interaction: Will the Establishment of a Poor Peasants' League in Zhao Zhuang Isolate Poor Peasants?" article on page sixteen of this newspaper, the reporter made two errors in the recorded final section that need to be corrected: The first point is, "only plays a backbone role, but does not handle everything" should be "only plays a backbone role, but does not lead everything." The second point is, "The Peasants' Representative Conference is the highest authority in the whole village" should be "The Peasants' Representative Conference is the highest authority of all the peasants in the village." According to this, we make the above corrections.

　　重要更正
    赵庄工作组来信指出，十六日本报一版编读往来“赵庄成立贫农团是否会使贫农孤立”一文，记者所记末段有两点错误需要更正：第一点是，“只起骨干作用，并非包办一切”，应是“只起骨干作用，并非领导一切”。第二点是，“农代会是全村最高权力机关”，应是“农代会是全村农民最高权力机关”。据此，特作如上更正。
