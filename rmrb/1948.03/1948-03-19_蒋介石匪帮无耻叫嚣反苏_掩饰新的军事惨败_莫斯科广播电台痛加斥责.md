Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Moscow Radio broadcast a commentary by Masinu on the 5th of this month, severely criticizing the Chiang bandits for intensifying anti-Soviet propaganda, stating: The Kuomintang reactionaries' recent strengthening of anti-Soviet propaganda was launched simultaneously with the new defeats suffered by their army in Manchuria and the adoption of the so-called new aid plan by American imperialism. In the past two and a half years, every anti-Soviet propaganda campaign by the Kuomintang reactionaries has been closely linked to the unfavorable situation of the Chinese civil war for them and the increased interference of American imperialism in China's internal affairs. As long as the situation on the civil war front is unfavorable to the Kuomintang, they will definitely fabricate the rumor of so-called "Soviet assistance from within." Now, when the Kuomintang army in Manchuria is facing the crisis of being completely annihilated, these fabricated rumors are again filling the Kuomintang newspapers.

As early as May 3, 1946, the Soviet Union completely withdrew its troops from China. The Soviet Union has consistently followed a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. The Kuomintang slanderers are not unaware of these facts. Their repeated dissemination of absurd rumors is only to justify their military failures in order to once again sell out the interests of the Chinese nation in exchange for increased aid from American imperialism. The Kuomintang reactionaries have always regarded the interests of the Chinese nation as a bargaining chip in their despicable deals with American imperialism. The interests of the Chinese people, however, require maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Because this is the foundation for guaranteeing China's independent development and security. After World War II, when American imperialism began to implement its plan to enslave the people of Asia and the Far East, and began to revive Japanese militarism for this purpose, this principle of maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union has particularly important significance. However, in order to obtain American imperialist aid for their anti-democratic, counter-revolutionary war, the Kuomintang reactionaries do not hesitate to sell out the interests of the Chinese nation.

On January 20, the International News Agency published a report from the Japanese "Japan Times" stating that the Kuomintang is conducting a new deal. As a result of the negotiations, American imperialism has promised to provide the Kuomintang reactionaries with new "military aid," while the Kuomintang reactionaries have agreed to fully accept the Far East plan of the Marshall Plan (including the revival of Japanese militarism) and agreed to make China (the KMT-controlled area) completely subordinate to the rule of the United States economically, politically, and militarily. This is also reflected in the Kuomintang's propaganda. For example, the means of flirting and intimidating the United States, such as so-called friendship with the Soviet Union and so-called joint action with the Soviet Union on the Japanese issue, have now disappeared, replaced by a frantic anti-Soviet movement. The Kuomintang reactionaries have recently made the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance the main target of their attacks. This is not accidental, because this treaty stipulates that neither side can take unilateral action on issues related to Japan, and because this treaty provides a powerful guarantee for preventing the revival of Japan and ensuring China's security. It can be seen that the reason why the Kuomintang is carrying out an anti-Soviet movement is to cover up their selling out of more national sovereignty and national interests to American imperialism.

### 蒋介石匪帮无耻叫嚣反苏　掩饰新的军事惨败  莫斯科广播电台痛加斥责

　　蒋介石匪帮无耻叫嚣反苏
  　掩饰新的军事惨败
    莫斯科广播电台痛加斥责
    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科电台于本月五日广播马西努痛斥蒋匪强化反苏宣传的评论称：国民党反动派最近加强反苏宣传，是与其军队在满洲遭受新的失败，及美帝采取所谓新援助计划而同时发起的。最近两年半以来，国民党反动派的每一次反苏宣传，总与中国内战情势对他们不利及美国加强干涉中国内政密切相连系。只要内战前线情势一不利于国民党，他们就一定大造其所谓“苏联从中援助”的谣言。现在当国民党军队在满洲已面临完全被歼的危机时，这种捏造的谣言，又满载在国民党的报纸上。
    远在一九四六年五月三日，苏联就将自己的军队完全撤离中国。苏联一贯遵循不干涉中国内政的政策。国民党诽谤之徒并非不知道这些事实，他们三番五次的散布无稽谣言，不过是为了辩护自己的军事失败，以便再次出卖中国民族利益，以交换美帝加强对他们的援助。国民党反动分子向来把中国民族利益，当成与美帝国主义做下贱买卖的交换品。而中国人民的利益，是要求与苏联保持友好关系。因为，这是保证中国独立发展与安全的基础。在第二次世界大战以后，当美帝国主义开始实现自己的奴役亚洲及远东各国人民的计划，并为此而开始复活日本军国主义时，这种与苏联保持友好关系的原则具有特别重要的意义。但国民党反动派则为了取得美帝对他们反民主、反革命战争的援助，就不惜出卖中国民族利益。
    一月二十日国际新闻社发表日本时报的消息，说国民党正进行新买卖，谈判的结果，美帝国主义已答应给予国民党反动派以新的“军事援助”，而国民党反动派则同意完全接受马歇尔计划的远东方案（包括复活日本军国主义），并且同意使中国（蒋管区）在经济、政治及军事上完全服从美国的统治。这在国民党的宣传中也反映了出来，例如去年所谓与苏联友好，所谓在日本问题上与苏联共同行动等等向美国撒娇恫吓的那种手段，现在已销声匿迹，代之而起的是疯狂的反苏运动。国民党反动分子最近已把中、苏友好同盟条约当成攻击的主要目标，这不是偶然的，因为这个条约规定：双方在关于对日问题上，不能采取单独行动，并且因为这个条约在阻止日本复活保证中国安全上提供了有力的保障。可见国民党所以进行反苏运动，就是为了掩护他们把更多的国家主权和民族利益出卖给美国帝国主义。
