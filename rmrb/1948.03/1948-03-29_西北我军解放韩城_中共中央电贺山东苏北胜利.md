Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army liberated Hancheng, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits on the west bank of the Yellow River, at 7 p.m. on the 24th. The enemy's Shaanxi Security Regiment abandoned the city and fled south, and is being pursued and annihilated. Hancheng is the eighth county seat liberated by our army since the start of the southern line offensive. It was once liberated by us on October 11th last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has sent a telegram to the East China Military Region to celebrate the victories in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu. The original text is as follows:

To Comrades Chen Yi, Zhang Yunyi, and Rao Shushi of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army; To Comrades Xu Shiyou and Tan Zhenlin of the Shandong Corps of the People's Liberation Army; To Comrades Wei Guoqing and Chen Pixian of the Northern Jiangsu Corps of the People's Liberation Army, and to all commanders and fighters of the two corps:

Celebrating the great victories of the People's Liberation Army in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu! Since annihilating a large number of enemies in the Jiaodong Peninsula last winter, the Shandong Corps of our People's Liberation Army has again annihilated more than 30,000 enemies in the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, and captured and recovered Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Linzi, Zichuan, Zouping, Huantai, Changshan, Zhangqiu, Mingshui, Longshan, Qidong, Boshan, Laiwu, Mengyin and other towns. The Northern Jiangsu Corps of our People's Liberation Army has persisted in the Northern Jiangsu area for a long time, annihilated a large number of enemies in the past six months, and recovered many towns. This time, it annihilated a brigade of enemies and recovered Funing. As the various battlefronts across the country launch victorious offensives, the good news from Shandong and Northern Jiangsu is constantly pouring in, which is extremely gratifying. We extend our condolences to you, and hope that you will unite all the military and civilians and strive to annihilate all the enemy troops in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu!
