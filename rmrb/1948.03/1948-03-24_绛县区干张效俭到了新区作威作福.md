(Taiyue News) He Wang Village in the Third District of Jiang County, Jinan, is a new district. In this village, there is a district cadre named Zhang Xiaojian, who is from Qin County. He leads the land reform in the village, but his work style is not good. The following are some examples: First, he occupied more than three mu of wheat field and fruit trees from the masses in the village. The village peasant association sent people to plow it, the military committee watched over the sheep grazing on the land, and the village helped with the planting. He also occupied more than one mu of cotton field, which was also planted and hoed by the village, and the cotton was picked by elementary school students, so he got everything ready-made. Second, he opened a cooperative in the village. The village military committee only contributed 20,000 yuan, and the rest was all Xiaojian's. No villager had any shares in it, and it sold consumables such as wine, meat, paper, and cigarettes. Third, Xiaojian's brother (Xiaoyi) came to the village from Qin County last June to learn weaving. He was not registered, did not contribute labor, and did not pay any taxes. He also took a new pair of black cotton pants from the fruits of the masses, and burned wood from the fruits of the struggle. Every time the women held group meetings, he would go there to make trouble, and he even threatened the peasant association chairman, Liu Jucheng, saying, "Do you know what I do?" Liu Jucheng said, "Then I don't know!" He said, "I am here to inspect your village cadres." Xiaojian's brother (Xiaoyi) could do whatever he wanted in the village, and no village cadre or villager dared to question him. Fourth, because of the ruffians, Wang Zhulin and Wang Xiaoliu were each fined one dan of wheat, Xiaojian said that it would be handed over to the district. But this wheat was sold by Xiaojian. The peasant association chairman said that no receipt was given to the village, and no one in the village dared to ask about it. But in secret, the masses secretly said that the two dan of wheat were not handed over to the district, and Xiaojian put it into his own "cooperative." Fifth, Zhang Hongfa has been a village policeman, village deputy, and village chief since he came back from Japan, and he is still the village chief now. In July 1946, when the enemy attacked Jinan, Chiang Kai-shek's troops came to the village. Zhang Hongfa led the bandits to the home of the blacksmith Bian Erzi (his fifth brother was the director of the village military committee) and pointed at Bian Erzi, saying, "Erzi, tell the truth, quickly hand over the guns of our village military committee." Bian Erzi said, "The people and guns have all gone up the mountain. I am blacksmithing all day and don't know anything." As a result, a group of bandits tied Erzi up and hung him from the beams, and also found Erzi's brother from the shed and beat him with gun butts and bayonets, and he lay down for several months. Last winter, Erzi wanted to raise an opinion about Zhang Hongfa, but Zhang Xiaojian said, "Don't raise an opinion about him now. If he is removed, I am afraid no one will take his hat (as village chief)." Bian Erzi was afraid, so he had to give up raising the opinion.
    The above is what I have heard and seen, and there are witnesses and evidence. (Wen Bo)

       绛县区干张效俭到了新区作威作福
    【太岳消息】晋南绛县三区河王村是新区，在这个村里有个区干部张效俭，是沁县人，在该村领导土改，作风不好，有以下几件事：一、在本村占了群众果实麦地三亩多，村农会给派人犁，武委会给看羊卧地，村里给种，占棉花地一亩多，也是村里给种、给锄、小学生给摘棉花，他得现成。二、在该村开合作社一座，只有村武委会二万元，其余都是效俭的，没群众一股，里边卖的是酒肉纸烟等消耗品。三、效俭哥自去年六月沁县来到这村学织布，不上户口不支差，什么负担都不出，还拿群众果实新黑棉裤一条，烧斗争果实木料，每次妇女开小组会，他都去调皮，还威胁农会主席刘聚成说：“你知道我是干什么的？”刘聚成说：“那我不知道呀！”他说：“我是检查你们村干部的。”效俭哥（效义）在村里想怎样就怎样，村干部和群众没一人敢问。四、因二流子罚了王竹林、王小六每人一石麦子，效俭说往区里交。但这麦子被效俭卖了。农会主席说没给村里收条，村里没人敢问这事。但背地里群众偷偷说，那两石麦子就没往区里交，效俭入了自己的“合作社”了。五、张鸿发自日本来后一直当村警、村副、村长，现在还当村长。四六年七月敌人进攻晋南时，蒋匪军到该村，张鸿发领上匪军到铁匠卞二子家里（他五弟是村武委会主任）指着卞二子说：“二子说实话吧，咱村武委会的枪快拿出来。”卞二子说：“人枪都上山了，我一天打铁什么也不知道。”结果一群匪军把二子绑住吊在梁上，又把二子的哥从棚上也找下来了，拿枪杆刺刀打了一顿，躺了几个月。去年冬天二子要提张鸿发的意见，张效俭说：“现在不要提他的意见，把他去了，怕没人顶他的帽子（当村长）。”卞二子害怕，只好不提意见了。
    以上说的，都是我听的见的，有人证物证。（文波）
