Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: Comprehensive reports: The Chiang bandits' frenzied conscription in northern Jiangsu has aroused the people's heroic resistance. The Chiang bandit "Northern Jiangsu Garrison Command" ordered the four Chiang bandit county governments of Haizhou, Ganyu, Guanyun, and Shuyang (already recovered by us) to deliver 10,000 conscripts in the first phase of this year. Baoying, Xinghua, and other counties were also assigned quotas of over 1,000 each, while Taizhou was to draft 10 to 15 men from each bao. The Chiang bandit county governments, within their occupied areas, adopted extremely vicious methods such as forced assignment, surrounding marketplaces, and searching houses at night to capture "conscripts." In Xinghua city, more than 150 shop assistants and poor people were seized in one night. In Changxing Town, Haimen, more than 30 farmers who went to the streets to trade were seized one early morning. In the Nantong area along the Yangtze River, merchants passing by were also seized and forced into military service. Chiang bandits in various places also took the opportunity to extort money during the conscription: the section chief of the Siyang puppet county government extorted 7.2 million yuan per conscript, while Gaoyou and Baoying also adopted the method of buying conscripts, with a fee of 3 million yuan per person. The captured "conscripts" lived an inhuman life. In Shuyang city, conscripts were only given one meal of thin porridge a day, and had no quilts or straw mats to sleep on. From January 26th to 30th, 26 people froze to death. However, the people in the Chiang-controlled areas are unwilling to be cannon fodder for Chiang bandits' civil war and have risen up to resist the Chiang bandits' tyrannical conscription. The people's local armed forces in the liberated areas are actively advancing into the border areas to support the people in the Chiang-occupied areas in combating the Chiang bandits' conscription. The Si(yang) Shu(yang) guerrilla team in northern Jiangsu braved the severe cold and snow, crossed the Liutang River to pursue the Chiang bandits who were conscripting, and rescued a large number of young people. The local armed forces of a certain township in Hai'an and Taizhou, central Jiangsu, went to the strongholds to arrest six stubborn family members, forcing the Chiang bandits to release more than 100 people who had been captured from the township. In Zhuwei Village near Taixing, Wang and his wife used kitchen knives and sickles to resist the Chiang bandits, saving sixteen young people. In a village north of Suqian, Ma Qi Shao's daughter-in-law hacked the bandit bao captain who was conscripting, allowing her grandson to escape. Five young people who were captured in Xiqiao, Shiji, managed to untie their ropes, seize guns, and kill the Chiang bandits who were escorting them, and all five escaped.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: News from Chiang-controlled newspapers: Farmers in Wuxi recently protested the barbaric rule of the Chiang bandit authorities. On the 3rd of last month, landlords and the Chiang bandit "Wu'an Self-Defense Force" carried out "armed rent collection" in the Taxi Township area. Many villages in the area were looted, and several houses were destroyed. People were seized to "pursue rent," causing chaos and resentment among the farmers. The next day, representatives of farmers from Gu Ren, Taxi, Jincheng, Guanxi, and Daqiangmen Town, about a hundred people, jointly went to the city to petition and protest, putting forward five demands, including severely punishing lawless landlords, returning the rent contracts that were forced into signing, compensating the farmers for the losses during the "armed rent collection," and guaranteeing that similar incidents would not occur in the future. The Chiang bandit authorities, intimidated by the power of the masses, were forced to agree. It is reported that the farmers in the area have been persecuted in the past. Not long ago, the Chiang bandit authorities used "farmers resisting rent" as an excuse to forcibly disband the farmers' associations in various townships.

　　蒋匪兵源枯竭到处搜捕壮丁
  　江苏农民奋勇抗拒
    我边缘区游击队展开护丁斗争
    【新华社华东二十四日电】综合报导：蒋匪在苏北的疯狂抓丁已激起人民的英勇反抗。蒋匪“苏北师管区司令部”曾勒令规定海州、赣榆、灌云、沭阳（按已为我克复）四蒋匪县政府，今年第一期即要交足壮丁一万名。宝应、兴化等县亦各规定一千名以上，泰州每保抽十至十五人。蒋匪各县政府即在其侵占区内采用强派，逢集包围及黑夜挨家抄搜等穷凶极恶办法捕捉“壮丁”。兴化城内一夜即抓去店员贫民一百五十余名，海门长兴镇在一个清早即抓走了三十余上街买卖的农民。南通沿江一带，来往商人亦被抓充壮丁。蒋匪各地在抓丁中复乘机敲榨：泗阳伪县政府科长每丁勒索七百二十万元，高邮、宝应亦采用买丁办法，壮丁费每名三百万元。被抓“壮丁”过着非人生活，沭阳城壮丁一天只喝到一顿稀粥，睡觉无被无草。一月二十六日至三十日即冻死二十六人。但蒋区人民不愿做蒋匪内战炮灰，已奋起反抗蒋匪抓丁暴政，解放区人民地方武装更积极挺进边沿区，支援蒋占区人民打击蒋匪抓丁。苏北泗（阳）沭（阳）游击队，冒着严寒风雪，渡过六塘河追击抓丁蒋匪，搭救了大批青年。苏中海安、泰州某乡地方武装到据点抓回顽属六家，逼使蒋匪将抓去该乡的一百余人放回。泰兴近郊朱圩村，王某夫妇两人，用菜刀镰刀抵御蒋匪，救护了十六个青年。宿迁北某村马七绍翁媳两人，猛砍抓丁的匪保队长，使孙儿逃脱。史集西桥五个被抓青年，其中三个解脱绳索后，即夺枪打死押送的蒋匪，五人全部逃脱。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】蒋区报纸消息：无锡农民近抗议蒋匪当局的野蛮统治。上月三日该县地主与蒋匪“武安自卫队”至塔西乡一带实行“武装催租”，该地村庄多遭洗劫，数家房屋则被捣毁，并要抓人“追租”，一时闹得鸡飞狗跳墙，农民均愤慨万分。次日，顾仁、塔西、金城、观西等乡及大墙门镇农民集合代表约百余人，联合进城请愿抗议，提出严惩不法地主、退还强迫订立的租签，赔偿农民在“武装催租”时的损失及保证以后不发生同样事件等五项要求。蒋匪当局慑于群众声威，被迫答应。按该地农民平日时遭迫害，不久前蒋匪当局即会以“农民抗租”为词，强迫解散各乡农会。
