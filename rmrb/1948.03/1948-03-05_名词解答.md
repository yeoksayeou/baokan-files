　　Noun Explanation

    Regarding the explanation of the term "Confederation" in the Noun Explanation column on page two of this newspaper on February 28th, which was incorrect, we hereby provide a revised explanation and apologize to our readers.

    "Confederation": "Confederation" (Confederation; Confederate State) is a type of composite state formed by multiple states. However, its central organization does not become a state itself, and therefore has no direct authority to command or coerce the people of each state. This is what distinguishes it from a Federation. However, it does have a central organization, which, entrusted by the various states, can exercise powers such as declaring war, making peace, and conducting diplomacy, thus forming a subject of international law. This is what distinguishes it from a general alliance (Alliance). Historically, there was the American Confederation of 1781-1789, the Swiss Confederation of 1815-1848, and the German Confederation of 1820-1866, the latter being particularly typical. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the "Allied Powers," the "Axis Powers," or the "United Nations" are "Confederations." The former two are merely alliances, and the latter is merely an international organization. Today, there are "alliances" among the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, but the editors of Pravda do not object to them; on the contrary, they support them, precisely because these are not the "Confederations" that Dimitrov spoke of.

　　名词解答
    本报上月二十八日二版名词解答栏，对于“邦联”一词的解答错误，兹重作解释如下，并向读者致歉。

    “邦联”：“邦联”（Ｃｏｎｆａｄｅｒａｔｉｏｎ；Ｃｏｎｆａｄｅｒａｔｅ　Ｓｔａｌｃ）是复合国家形式之一种，由多数邦国所组成，但其中央组织并不成为一个国家，故对各邦人民并无直接命令强制之权，这就是它所以别于联邦（Ｆｅｄｅｒａｔｌｏｎ）之处。但是它毕竟有一个中央组织，这一中央组织得因各邦国之委托而行使宣战、媾和、外交等权，构成国际法上权利主体，这又是它所以别于一般的联盟（Ａｌｉａｎｃｅ或同盟）之处。历史上曾有一七八一——一七八九年的美国邦联，一八一五——一八四八年的瑞士邦联与一八二○——一八六六年的德意志邦，后者尤为典型。因此说“同盟国”“轴心国”或“联合国”是“邦联”是不对的，前二者只是一种同盟，后者只是一种国际组织。今天东欧新民主各国间是有“同盟”的，然而真理报编者并不反对，反而赞成，就因为这不是季米特洛夫所说的“邦联”。
