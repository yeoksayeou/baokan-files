　　Taihang Military Region Headquarters
　　Compensation at a Discount for Cheaply Bought Fruits of Struggle
　　[Taihang News] A portion of cadres from the Taihang Military Region Headquarters, while participating in the rectification and study of units directly under the District Party Committee, self-criticized for having cheaply bought a portion of the fruits of struggle from the masses in the villages as far back as the year before last. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately decided to return the items and apologize to the masses. Recently, the Headquarters specially dispatched cadres to find the poor peasant leagues, peasant representative conferences, and cadres stationed in the villages, saying: "We were wrong to cheaply buy the fruits of struggle in our village the year before last. This is detrimental to the thorough emancipation of our poor people. Now we are resolutely acting in accordance with the Land Law Outline and will compensate, at a discount of 70,000 silver dollars, for the fruits of struggle that we cheaply bought and have already used." After the masses in the villages learned of this, they expressed their support for this action of the People's Army in resolutely implementing the Land Law.

　　太行军区司令部
  　折价赔偿贱买果实
    【太行消息】太行军区司令部一部分干部，在参加区党委直属队整编学习中，检查出远在前年曾经贱买过驻村群众斗争果实一部。领导上发现后，当即决定马上退还和向群众道歉。最近，司令部特派干部找着驻村贫农团、农代会及干部，说：“我们前年贱买咱村斗争果实很不对，这是损害咱穷人彻底翻身的，现在我们坚决按照土地法大纲办事，将前年贱买已用的果实，折价赔偿大洋七万元。”驻村群众知道后，对人民军队这种坚决执行土地法的行动，纷纷表示拥护。
