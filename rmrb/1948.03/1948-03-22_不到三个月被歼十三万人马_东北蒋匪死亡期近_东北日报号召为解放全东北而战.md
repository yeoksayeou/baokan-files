　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Fight for the Complete Liberation of Northeast China," stating:

　　After our army recovered Siping, the back door through which the Chiang bandits fleeing from Jilin and those trapped in Changchun relied on to retreat has been firmly closed, and a stepping stone to Shenyang has also been removed. The encirclement of Shenyang is becoming increasingly tight, and its isolation is no better than that of Changchun.

　　Before our army's winter offensive, the Chiang bandits妄想妄想妄想 vainly attempted to use the extreme cold weather to allow the war situation in the Northeast to "hibernate" temporarily and barely survive. However, our army braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, fought thousands of miles, traversing the Middle-Chang and Bei-Ning lines. In less than three months, we have recovered sixteen cities, including Changtu, Kaiyuan, Beizhen, Haicheng, Zhangwu, Liaozhong, Beipiao, Heishan, Taian, Panshan, Liaoyang, Anshan, Faku, Yingkou, Jilin, Siping, as well as important strongholds such as Dashiqiao, Dahushan, Xinlitun, Goubangzi, and Xinkaiyuan. We have annihilated more than 130,000 Chiang bandit regular and local troops, captured more than 180 Chiang bandit officers at the rank of colonel or higher (including 11 division commanders), and promoted the uprising of one division. Before the winter offensive, the Chiang bandits still had 28 cities in the Northeast. Now, only 12 isolated cities remain: Changchun, Tieling, Benxi, Fushun, Shenyang, Xinmin, Fuxin, Yixian, Jinzhou, Jinxi, Suizhong, and Xingcheng. In order to carry out a desperate struggle in the Northeast, the Chiang bandits have changed commanders three times, transferring Du Yuming, abandoning Chen Cheng, and replacing them with Wei Lihuang, adopting Luo Zhuoying's "consolidate points, connect lines, expand areas" strategy, but the result was losing points, breaking lines, and having no area left. In the past three months, our army has captured towns and cities defended by the Chiang bandits with a force of one division or more, and annihilated all their defenders, including Zhangwu, Xinlitun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Faku, and Siping. This proves that our army's combat effectiveness is becoming increasingly strong and invincible, and it also proves that the day of the Northeast Chiang bandits' demise is not far away. The editorial called on the military and civilians of Northeast China to make persistent efforts, accelerate the complete and thorough annihilation of the Northeast Chiang bandit army, and further support the national war. To achieve this goal, two major tasks must be accomplished: first, develop agricultural production and ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production tasks; second, protect and develop urban industry and commerce, especially in newly recovered cities, strictly prohibit indiscriminate arrests, and make long-term plans. Cherishing the city is cherishing revolutionary property, and it is increasing the guarantee of victory in the war. We must give full play to the city's contribution to the war. We must have not only grain and cotton produced in the countryside, but also industrial products produced in the city. This is the task of striving for the complete liberation of the Northeast and making the Northeast truly a strategic general base to support the entire country.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: All sectors of industry and commerce in Anshan City have resumed one after another. After the democratic government began its work, it actively carried out post-disaster relief work. In addition to allocating 700,000 catties of grain to relieve the poor people in the city, it also lent more than 200,000 catties of grain to various private factories to help them quickly resume operations. At present, mass organizations such as the city's Federation of Trade Unions, Chamber of Commerce, Student Union, and Women's Federation have also been established one after another. The market is prosperous and business is booming, especially in the major markets such as Tiedong, Tiexi, Letiandi, and Bajiazi, which have changed from the desolate scene during the Chiang bandit rule.

### 不到三个月被歼十三万人马　东北蒋匪死亡期近  东北日报号召为解放全东北而战

     不到三个月被歼十三万人马
   　东北蒋匪死亡期近
     东北日报号召为解放全东北而战
    【新华社东北二十日电】东北日报顷以“为完全解放东北而战”为题发表社论称：
    我军收复四平后，由吉林逃窜的蒋匪与困守长春的蒋匪赖以逃退的后门已牢实关闭，通向沈阳的一块踏脚石也被拔掉。对沈阳的包围已日益紧缩，其孤立情况并不好于长春多少。
    在我军冬季攻势之前，蒋匪曾妄想借着奇寒气候使东北战局暂时“冬眠”而残喘一口气，但是我军冒着零下三十度的严寒，转战千里，纵横中长、北宁沿线，至今为时不及三个月，已经收复城市十六座，计昌图、开原、北镇、海城、彰武、辽中、北票、黑山、台安、盘山、辽阳、鞍山、法库、营口、吉林、四平以及重要据点大石桥、打虎山、新立屯、沟帮子、新开原等地。歼灭蒋匪正规军及地方军八个整师，共十三万人以上。俘匪将校级军官一百八十余名。（内军师长十一人）另推动了一个师的起义。冬季攻势以前，蒋匪在东北的城市尚有二十八座，至今则只剩下长春、铁岭、本溪、抚顺、沈阳、新民、阜新、义县、锦州、锦西、绥中、兴城等十二座孤城。蒋匪为了在东北进行垂死挣扎，已经三易主帅，调走杜聿明，抛弃陈诚，再换上卫立煌，采用罗卓英的“固点联线扩面”，结果却是丢点断线无面。三个月来，我军攻克蒋匪以一个师兵力以上固守的城镇并尽歼其守敌的有彰武、新立屯、辽阳、鞍山、法库和四平。证明我军战斗力日益坚强，战无不胜，也证明东北蒋匪覆亡之期已不在远。社论号召东北军民再接再厉，加速彻底全部歼灭东北蒋匪军，并进而支援全国战争。为达到这个目的必须办好两件大事，第一是发展农业生产，保证今年农业生产的任务完成。第二是保护和发展城市工商业，特别对于新收复城市严格禁止乱抓一把，而要作长远打算。爱护城市就是爱护革命财产，就是增加战争胜利的保证；必须充分发挥城市对战争的贡献。我们不仅要有农村生产的粮食和棉花，而且要有城市生产的工业品。这是争取完全解放东北，并使东北真正做到支援全国的战略总基地的任务。
    【新华社东北二十日电】鞍山市工商各业已纷纷恢复，民主政府开始办公以后即积极进行善后救济工作，除拨粮七十万斤救济全市贫民外，并贷给各私营工厂粮食二十余万斤，帮助其迅速复业。现市内工会、商会、学联、妇联等群众团体亦已先后成立。市面繁荣，生意兴隆，尤以铁东、铁西、乐天地、八家子等几大市场最为热闹，一变蒋匪统治时的萧条景象。
