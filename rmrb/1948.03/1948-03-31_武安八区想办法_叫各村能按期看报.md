　　Wu'an Eighth District Finds Ways to Ensure Villages Can Read the Newspaper on Time

    [Our News] After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the postal workers were in high spirits, speeding up the distribution of Party newspapers so that they could quickly reach the masses. Postal workers at the Linqi Post Office in Linxian County voluntarily proposed changing the shift schedule. Every day at noon, after receiving the newspaper mail from Linxian County, they would set off immediately and arrive at Huangshui Pass Station by nightfall. The next morning at 10 o'clock, they would return to their station. This allowed the Huixian County Third and Fourth Districts and Xinxiang, which were served from Huangshui Pass Station, to receive the newspapers and return on the same day (previously it always took two days). The Xiuwu Bureau also changed from a night shift to a day shift. As a result of these changes, the transmission of mail and newspapers in the Taihang Fourth and Fifth Sub-districts was accelerated by a full day. Now, everyone has drawn up a work plan for March to ensure consistent speed and strive to surpass the vehicle teams. After improvements and reorganization in September, the rural postal route in the Ping Shun Fifth District saved manpower, and at the same time, the time for mail to reach villages from the district was shortened by two days. However, some places still do not pay close attention to the distribution of Party newspapers, resulting in a laissez-faire attitude. According to February statistics, out of the 48 villages in the Wu'an Eighth District, 46 villages subscribed to newspapers. The newspapers had a great impact after reaching the masses. For example, Shangquan and Nanzhuang villages are close to the district and can receive newspapers every day. Although there are no people in the villages who can read the entire newspaper, the cadres gather together, each recognizing a few characters, and then they can understand it. They explain the questions and answers about the Land Law to the masses and even perform plays to explain it. After the masses understood the spirit of the Land Law, they started delivering manure to the fields as early as the second or third day of the Lunar New Year. Some villages cannot regularly see the newspaper and don't understand what the "Land Law Outline" is all about. In many villages, such as Dongwannian, many poor and middle peasants and cadres who have taken too many fruits are waiting for an equal distribution and are not concentrating on production. All five correspondents in the district are supplied by the masses, but the masses often cannot read the newspaper on time. Although it is stipulated that newspapers and documents should be delivered every other day, this is not effectively implemented. The correspondents deliver them whenever they feel like it, or sometimes only deliver them once every five or six days. The suggestions of the masses to the correspondents are also ineffective. During the Lunar New Year and the Lantern Festival, four of the five correspondents went home, and the newspapers were distributed by the masses. In order to strengthen the distribution of Party newspapers, the chairman of the District Relief Association, based on the situation, proposed: 1. In order to serve the supplementary labor, starting from March, delivery will be changed to daily, and newspapers and letters will be personally delivered to readers. 2. A delivery book will be used, and readers will sign or stamp it after receiving it to avoid incidental situations. 3. Strive for one to two copies of the newspaper per village in all 48 villages in the district. And instructed all district cadres and correspondents to straighten out their thinking and regard the distribution of Party newspapers as an important task.

　　武安八区想办法
    叫各村能按期看报
    【本报消息】土地法大纲公布后，邮工们情绪很高，加快党报发行速度，使党报能很快深入群众。林县临淇邮站邮工自动提出改变班期，每天中午十二点接到林县报纸邮件后，马上出发，天黑赶到黄水口站。第二天上午十点钟就返回本站。这样使黄水口站出发辉县三、四区和新乡也能当天返回（过去总是误两天），修武局也由夜班改成白天班了。这样改变结果，太行四、五分区邮件报纸的传送，整个加快一天速度。现每人都订出三月份工作计划，保证速度经常，争取赛过车班。平顺五区乡村邮线从九月间改进整理后，节省了民力，同时邮件由区到村缩短两天时间。但有些地方对发行党报工作仍抓得不紧而形成自流。武安八区四十八个村中，据二月份统计，有四十六个村都订有报纸，在报纸深入群众后影响也极大，如上泉、南庄村离区较近，每天能收到报纸，村里虽没有能看通报的人，但干部们你认几个我认几个集起来就看懂了，并把关于土地法问答讲给群众听，编成戏演给大家看，群众懂了土地法精神，一过年初二、三就往地里送开粪了。有些村子不能经常看到报纸，摸不着“土地法大纲”到底是怎回事，如东万年等不少村子，有不少贫中农及多占果实的干部等待平分不安心生产。全区五个通讯员，全由本区群众供给，但群众却常常不能按期看报，虽订为隔日班送报纸文件，也未切实执行，通讯员愿送就送，不愿送就五、六天才送一次，群众向通讯员建议也仍无效。过旧历年和十五，五个通讯员就有四个回家，报纸拨群众去送。区救联会主席为加强党报发行，根据情况提出：一、为服务抽补，自三月起改为逐日送，报纸信件亲自投交读者。二、使用送文簿，读者收到后签字或盖章，以避免捎带情形。三、争取全区四十八个村每村一份到二份报纸。并指示全区干部通讯员打通思想，把党报发行看做重要工作。（榜存、建德、路英、士贤、修身、庚辰）
