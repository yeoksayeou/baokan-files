　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Moscow Dispatch: The Pravda editorial on February 28th stated: American agriculture continues to decline and degenerate, while Soviet agriculture is steadfastly moving towards the path of post-war development. According to Professor Vlasev of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification, in a recent interview with TASS reporters, the efficiency of tractors in the Soviet Union is four times higher than in the United States. The use of combine harvesters also greatly exceeds that of the United States. In the United States, because small farmers cannot afford it, 95 percent of farms do not use combine harvesters, and all available machinery is in the hands of a few wealthy farmers. The mechanization of agriculture in capitalist countries has destroyed millions of small farmers. According to materials from the American magazine "Fortune," the total number of American farm households has decreased by 200,000 in the past six years, with small and medium farmers suffering, and the number of agricultural workers has also decreased by 3 million, forming a "surplus of population." Conversely, the mechanization of agricultural tools in the Soviet Union has promoted prosperity. In the past two years, the agricultural sector has added tens of thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, automobiles, and other machines. Large-scale agricultural electrification is also underway. By 1950, 90 percent of all grain farmland will be cultivated by tractors, 70 percent will be sown by tractors, and 55 percent of the total cultivated land will be harvested by combine harvesters. By then, 70,000 collective farms, all machinery and tractor stations, and all state-owned farms will be electrified.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Moscow Dispatch: This year, Soviet potato planting will increase by 50 percent compared to last year, greatly exceeding pre-war levels. Soviet potato production ranks first in the world, possessing one-third of the world's potato planting area, and Soviet farmers have created the world's highest potato production record. In 1942, Siberian farmer Anna Yugina harvested 1,331 centners of potatoes per hectare (equivalent to 133,100 jin).
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Moscow Dispatch: In order to strive for a bumper harvest in 1948 and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, collective farms in the Altai region of the Soviet Union launched a nationwide competition. This has now been echoed by a large number of farms and tractor stations in the Kuban region and other provinces. Altai farmers wrote to Stalin, guaranteeing to expand the spring sowing area by 616,000 hectares and increase spring wheat production to no less than 21.6 to 22.8 centners per hectare (equivalent to 2,160 to 2,280 jin). News is now frequently heard of farmers from various regions being awarded the title of Socialist Labor Hero. Plivisentsev, a farmer from Yaroslavl Province, was awarded this glorious title for his achievements in harvesting 34.1 centners of wheat per hectare (equivalent to 3,410 jin) and 30.4 centners of rye (equivalent to 3,040 jin). Thirteen outstanding agriculturalists from Kuibyshev Province were also awarded the same title for their meritorious service.

　　美国农业正继续衰落退化
  　苏联乡村走向电气化
    农民展开竞赛争取今年大丰收
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科讯：真理报二月二十八日社论写道：美国的农业正继续衰颓退化，而苏联农业则坚定不移地向着战后发展的道路迈进。据苏联农业机械化和电气化学院伏拉赛夫教授最近向塔斯社记者发表谈话称：在苏联，拖拉机工作效力，较美国高四倍。至于联合收割机的使用，也大大超过美国。在美国，因为小农花费不起，百分之九十五农庄都没有使用联合收割机，一切可用机械都握在少数富农手里。资本主义国家的农业机械化，使几百万户小农毁灭。根据美“幸福”杂志材料，六年来，美农户总数已减少了二十万户，遭受牺牲的是小农和中农，同时农业工人数目也减少了三百万人，形成了“人口的过剩”。相反的，苏联农业工具的机械化，促进了繁荣。两年来，农业部门又添加了若干万部拖拉机、联合收割机，汽车和其他机器。大规模的农业电气化也在进行着。到一九五○年，整个谷物耕地的百分之九十将以拖拉机耕种，百分之七十将以拖拉机播种，总耕地的百分之五十五将以联合收割机收获。到那时，七万个集体农场，所有机器和拖拉机站，以及所有国营农场，都要电气化。
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科讯：今年苏联洋芋种植，将较去年扩增百分之五十，大大超过战前。苏联的洋芋生产，占世界首位，拥有全世界三分之一的洋芋种植地，苏联农民曾创造了全世界最高的洋芋生产纪录。一九四二年西伯利亚农民安娜·犹金纳，在每一公顷耕地上收获洋芋一千三百三十一生丁纳（合十三万三千一百斤）。
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科讯：为争取一九四八年大丰收和提前完成五年计划，苏联阿尔泰区集体农场发起全国范围的竞赛号召。现已得到库班流域及其他省份广大农场和拖拉机站的响应。阿尔泰农民写信给斯大林，保证扩大春耕面积六十一万六千公顷，增加春麦生产到每公顷收获不少于二十一点六至二十二点八生丁纳（合二千一百六十至二千二百八十斤）。现在经常听到各地农民荣获社会主义劳动英雄称号的消息。雅罗斯拉夫省农民普立维森杰夫，以每公顷收获小麦三十四点一生丁纳（合三千四百一十斤）和裸麦卅点四生丁纳（合三千零四十斤）的功绩，获得这一光荣称号。库比雪夫省十三名优秀农业家也因功荣膺同一称号。
