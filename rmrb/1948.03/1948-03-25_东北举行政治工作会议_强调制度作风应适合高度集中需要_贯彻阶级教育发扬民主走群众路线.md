Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: The first grand political work conference of the Northeast Military Region began at the start of last month and has now successfully concluded after lasting over a month. The main content of this conference was to discuss party rectification and military consolidation. At the beginning of the conference, each column and military district reported on the organizational status, ideological style, policies, and discipline of their troops. This was followed by the introduction of typical experiences in class education, Party committee system, mass line, fostering combat readiness, war evaluation movements, contract-based merit, ideological rectification, officer-soldier unity, troop consolidation, and work regarding liberated soldiers and civilian laborers in each unit. This phase achieved the purpose of exchanging experiences and learning from each other. The second phase involved discussion and summarization. First, Tan Zheng, Director of the Political Department of the Military Region, gave a detailed report on issues such as party rectification and military consolidation, land reform education, the implementation of democratic movements under centralized leadership, and policies for mass work in new areas. Discussions were then launched, and representatives from each unit made relatively profound exposures of deviations in leadership thinking and impure ideological styles within the troops. Detailed discussions were also held on how to implement party rectification and military consolidation, carry out democratic movements in the troops, establish company-level soldiers' committees, and unify troop organization. During this period, reports were also heard from Zhou Huan, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Region, on winning over liberated soldiers, Liu Yalou, Chief of Staff, on reorganization issues, Luo Ronghuan, Deputy Political Commissar, on the current situation in the Northeast and the tasks of army building, Li Fuchun of the Northeast Bureau on financial and economic issues, and Gao Gang on land policy. Finally, Director Tan made a summary of the discussions, at which point the conference concluded. In his report on the situation in the Northeast, Deputy Political Commissar Luo pointed out: Currently, the Chiang bandit forces in the Northeast have completely moved towards disadvantage, while we are moving towards advantage. Since the summer offensive operations in May of last year, we have annihilated more than 300,000 enemy troops in ten months. Although the enemy has changed commanders three times and altered their operational guidance three times, they still cannot save their inevitable fate of defeat. Currently, the enemy's remaining forces in the Northeast consist of only thirty-seven divisions, including their rear organs, totaling approximately 500,000 people. These forces are distributed in cities that have been divided and isolated by us. The enemy's morale has been greatly reduced, and new large-scale reinforcements are relatively difficult for them. When talking about the military building tasks of our army, he pointed out that we must not only build the army to strive for the victory of the Northeast, but also to support the national operations, first of all, to support the North China operations to build a large-scale army. Therefore, all our work systems and styles should be suitable for the needs of highly centralized, we must unify the organization of the front and rear, thoroughly rectify the rear organs, clean up the housework, build a sound staff work, improve the staff's business, build a new regular system, change the old guerrilla style, oppose departmentalism and equalitarianism, and establish an overall concept. When talking about the issue of cultivating cadres, he pointed out that a large number of emancipated peasants have now poured into the troops, and they all have a considerable class consciousness. We should rely on them as the backbone to change the face of the troops and make the troops grow a new atmosphere. After half a year of training, a large number of squad and platoon cadres should be promoted from this new component. On the issue of saving civilian labor and reducing the burden on the people, he stressed that we must proceed from a long-term perspective and not waste a grain of food, a civilian laborer, a cart, or a horse; otherwise, we would be irresponsible to the war and make mistakes. Regarding the political work policy of the troops, he pointed out that class education should be its basic content, promote democracy, and follow the mass line, use the experience of the masses to educate the masses, and raise the level of the masses to the level of policy. The spontaneity of the masses and the thinking of the leadership must be combined to prevent deviations. He mentioned the five rectifications and one investigation proposed by Comrade Tan Zheng in his report—rectifying ideology, rectifying work style, rectifying relations, rectifying discipline, rectifying organization, and investigating composition—should become the working policy of this period, and we should focus on rectifying the thinking of cadres. Self-criticism from top to bottom must be combined with criticism from bottom to top. Under the highly centralized organizational form and leadership of the military, if there is no self-criticism from top to bottom, and if many problems are not raised to the level of leadership thinking for review, the problems cannot be truly solved. Finally, Deputy Political Commissar Luo called on cadres at all levels to study Chairman Mao's reports carefully, especially the ten military principles, land reform, party rectification policies, and the four economic programs of Chairman Mao. Educate soldiers to understand urban policies, cherish manpower and material resources, and strictly enforce discipline. If there is any damage to urban industry and commerce, the leaders of the troops should be held accountable.

　　东北举行政治工作会议
    强调制度作风应适合高度集中需要
  　贯彻阶级教育发扬民主走群众路线
    【新华社东北二十三日电】东北军区第一次盛大政治工作会议于上月初开始，历时月余现已胜利闭幕。此次会议主要内容为讨论整党整军问题。会议首由各纵队各军区汇报部队组织状况、思想作风、政策纪律等情况，继即介绍各部队阶级教育，党委制度，群众路线，酝酿战斗情绪，战评运动，合同立功，整顿思想，官兵团结，巩固部队，争取解放战士及民工工作等典型经验。这一阶段，达到了交流经验互相学习的目的。第二阶段即进入讨论与总结。首先由军区政治部谭政主任将整党整军、土改教育、开展集中领导下的民主运动及新区群众工作的政策等问题，作了详尽的报告，展开讨论，各部队代表对于领导思想上的偏差、部队思想作风不纯等问题均作了比较深刻的揭发，对于如何贯彻整党整军，开展部队民主运动，建立连队士兵委员会，及部队统一编制等问题也进行了详细的研讨。其间又听取了军区政治部周桓副主任关于争取解放战士的报告，刘亚楼参谋长关于整编问题的报告，罗荣桓副政委关于东北目前形势与建军任务的报告，东北局李富春同志关于财经问题的报告，高岗同志关于土地政策的报告。最后由谭主任作讨论的总结，至此会议即告结束。罗副政委在关于东北的形势报告中指出：目前东北蒋匪已完全走向劣势，我则走向优势，从去年五月夏季攻势作战以来，十个月内歼敌三十余万，敌人虽三易主帅，三次改变作战指导方针，但仍不能挽救其必败的命运。现在东北敌人所有的兵力只剩三十七个师，包括其后方机关在内，总共约有五十余万人，且均分布在被我分割孤立的城市中，敌之士气，已大大降低，其新的大量的增援，也比较困难了。谈到我军的建军任务时，指出我们不但要为争取东北的胜利而建军，而且更要为支援全国作战，首先是支援华北作战而建设大规模的军队。因之我们的一切工作制度作风均应适合于高度集中的需要，必须统一前后方的编制，彻底整顿后方机关，清理家务，建设健全的参谋工作，提高参谋的业务，建设新的正规制度，改变旧的游击作风，反对本位主义与平均主义，树立整体观念。在谈到培养干部问题时，他指出现在各部队都已涌进大量的翻身农民，他们均有相当的阶级觉悟，应依靠他们为骨干，改变部队的面貌，使部队生长一种新的气象，经过半年的锻炼，应该从这批新成份中大量提拔班排干部。对于节省民力，减轻人民的负担问题，着重指出必须从长期观点出发，不要浪费一粒粮食，一个民工，一辆大车，一匹马，否则就是对战争不负责，就是犯了错误。关于部队的政治工作方针，他指出应以阶级教育为其基本内容，发扬民主，走群众路线，以群众自己的经验来教育群众，把群众的水平提高到政策的水平。群众的自发与领导的思想必须结合，防止偏向。他提到谭政同志在报告中所提出的五整一查——整思想，整作风，整关系，整纪律，整编制，查成份，应成为这一时期工作方针，并应着重整顿干部思想，必须使自上而下的自我批评与自下而上的批评相结合，在军队的高度集中的组织形式与首长制下面，如果没有自上而下的自我批评，如不把许多问题都提高到领导思想上来检讨，就不能真正解决问题。最后，罗副政委号召各级干部应该好好学习毛主席的报告，特别要学习毛主席的十条军事原则，土地改革，整党方针，及经济纲领四个问题。教育战士懂得城市政策，爱惜人力物力，严格执行纪律。如有任何破坏城市工商业，应向该部队首长追究责任。
