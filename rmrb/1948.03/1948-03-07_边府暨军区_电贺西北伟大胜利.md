　　Telegraph Congratulates Northwest on Great Victory
　　[Our Newspaper News] The Jinji Luyu Border Region Government, Military District Headquarters, and Military District Political Department recently sent a congratulatory telegram on the great victory on the Southern Front in the Northwest. The original telegram is as follows: To Commander Peng of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, Deputy Commanders Zhang and Zhao, and all commanders and fighters:
　　We are delighted to hear of the great victory on the Southern Front, in which the entire Hu bandit's reorganized 29th Army Headquarters and the reorganized 27th and 90th Divisions were annihilated. The entire region's military and civilians are jubilant and inspired, and their confidence in victory has been further enhanced. We vow to fully cooperate and support you in completely annihilating the Hu bandits and thoroughly liberating the people of the Great Northwest. We hereby send our congratulations and wish you even greater victories.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th] The Jin Sui Border Region Administrative Office and the Provisional Committee of the Farmers' Association recently jointly sent a congratulatory message on the victory in Yichuan, stating:
　　Your great victory has doubly encouraged the military and civilians in the liberated areas, who are fighting to smash the rule of the American imperialist lackey, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland, to march more bravely towards the final victory. It will also bring joy and hope to the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are suffering under the ravages of the Chiang Hu bandits. The dying Chiang Hu bandit gang is trembling and collapsing under your heavy iron fists. In our joy, we are determined to support you with all our strength and wish you more brilliant victories in the battle to liberate the Great Northwest.
