　　People on the Edge of Xiuwu Hear About Land Law
　　Send Messages to Chiang Area to Call Family Members Home
　　[Xiuwu News] Since March 1st, Xiuwu County has fully launched an offensive against the enemy's political influence, extensively publicizing the Land Law Outline and news of victory. After fourteen days of efforts, according to the statistics of the first and second districts, more than 450 people have returned, bringing back six head of livestock. Some families returned completely, while others returned one or two members. This is common in all villages. Since March 1st, our small armed forces have been active behind enemy lines, pushing the enemy in Liejiangying back to their strongholds. Initially, the masses were somewhat skeptical about our Land Law Outline, but they paid close attention. When elementary school teachers went down to write slogans and publicize the Land Law Outline, a large group of people followed them to Xibanqiao in the second district, demanding an explanation. Some asked: "Is it really going to be implemented?" The reply was: "It is being implemented now." They said: "If this method had been implemented earlier, the people in our village would have returned long ago." After a few days, a small number of people returned. Those who returned were cared for by the masses and comforted by the county and district cadres. They felt very close and said: "If we had known it would be like this upon returning, why did we suffer there?"
　　The second district also held a meeting of more than 50 family members of puppet soldiers, explaining the Land Law Outline. At that time, some people sent messages to call their sons and husbands back. After such extensive publicity, the ideological concerns of the masses have been broken, and now they are all asking for road passes to go down and call people back. No one went to call from Jiaozhuang, and the masses below sent messages back saying: "Do our village cadres still want us or not? If others can come to call, why can't they call us?" (Zuo Min, Jing Chun, Qiang Guo)
　　[Northern Henan News] Recently, landlords who fled from northern Henan are constantly returning from Zhengzhou and other places south of the Yellow River. On March 14th, Chan Jiuyun and other eight people who returned to Chanzhuang Village in the fifth district of Wen County, the woman and two children of Wang Jingde from Liyuan Village, and Zhang Songshi and her daughter from Jiubao in Wude Town, Qinyang, also returned. They heard that the Eighth Route Army had issued the Land Law Outline and that they could divide the land equally. Eating every day was a big problem outside. He said: "We heard about your Land Law Outline in Zhengzhou, so we came back first. Those behind will all come back." (Niu Hongyuan)

　　修武边地群众听到土地法
  　捎信蒋区叫回家属
    【修武消息】修武县从三月一号开始，全面展开对敌政攻，大量宣传土地法大纲与胜利消息。经过十四天的努力，现据一、二区的统计，已回来群众四百五十多人，带回牲口六头，有的全家回来，有的回来一、二个，各村普遍都有。从三月一号起，我小股武装活动敌后，把烈江营敌人压到据点。起初群众对我土地法大纲是有些不全信，但很注意，当小学教员下去写标语，宣传土地法大纲，到二区西板桥写时，后面跟着一大堆人要求讲。有的问：到底真实行不？答：“现在就实行。”他们说：如早实行这办法，我村人早回来了。过了几天，有少数人回来，回来的人都受到群众的爱护和县区干部的安慰，他们觉得非常亲热说：“早知回来是这样，咱在那里受那罪干什么”。
    二区又召开了五十多人的伪军家属会议，讲土地法大纲，当时就有人捎信叫他儿子和叫他男人回来。经这样广泛宣传后，已打破群众的思想顾虑，现都纷纷要求开路条下去叫人。焦庄没人去叫，下面的群众往回捎信说：看俺村干部还要我们不要？人家能来叫，他们就不能叫一下。（左敏、景春、强国）
    【豫北消息】近来豫北在外逃亡地主不断的从黄河南郑州等地返回来。三月十四日温县五区禅庄村回来的禅九云等八人，犁园村王敬德女人和两个小孩子，沁阳武德镇九保的张宋氏和他的闺女二人也都回来了。他们听说八路军发了土地法大纲回来能平分土地，在外每天吃饭也是个大事情。他说：在郑州听说咱们土地法大纲下来了，我们先回来啦，后边的都要回来的。（牛洪元）
