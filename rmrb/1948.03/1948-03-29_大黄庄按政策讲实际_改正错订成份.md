　　Dahuangzhuang Emphasizes Practicality According to Policy
  　Correcting Wrongly Classified Class Status
    [Xiangyuan News] Dahuangzhuang previously had a total of 227 households. In the past, when classifying classes, there were 15 landlord households, 15 rich peasant households, 8 "bankrupt landlord" households, 10 well-to-do middle peasant households, 18 middle peasant households, 30 lower-middle peasant households, and 101 poor and hired peasant households. Landlords and rich peasants accounted for 17 percent of the total number of households in the village. The classification method was to trace back three generations, and the cadres made the decisions.

    After the Poor Peasants League was officially established this time, everyone believed that the first major task should be to clarify the class status. Some said that classifying class was like determining fate, and it must be discussed practically and democratically according to policy, and it should be what it is. After two days of heated discussions in large and small meetings, the class status of the entire village was initially clarified. There were 10 landlord households, 5 rich peasant households, 12 well-to-do middle peasant households, 65 middle peasant households, 56 lower-middle peasant households, and 85 poor and hired peasant households, totaling 233 households (6 more households were previously separated, and they were classified as one household in the past). In the process of classification, there was Wang Dexian, the son of the landlord Wang Tianshun, who was originally a child from a poor family. Because his family could not make a living, he became the son of the landlord Wang Tianshun at the age of three. He started working in the fields at the age of ten, and he still suffered when he grew up. Although he lived in the landlord's house, he ate different food than others and was treated harshly like a hired worker. His wife is a landlord's woman. He was classified as a landlord in the past. After this discussion, the poor and hired peasants believed that the property of the landlord Wang Tianshun should be confiscated, and Wang Dexian should break away from his landlord family and be given a share of land and property like the peasants (he has already joined the army). As for his wife, she must participate in labor for five years before her class status can be changed. One family has two different class statuses and is treated in three different ways. Miao Yushun's wife, who was wrongly classified in the past, said: "It was really uncomfortable to be classified as a landlord in the past. Today, I took off this hat, and I feel much more relaxed. I never thought that I could still attend meetings with the peasants today!" Wang Kaowen said: "A few days ago, I was like a silkworm on a frame, unwilling to eat or move. Now that I am classified as a middle peasant, I feel very appropriate, not like the past when it was compared to a pile of dirt." Middle peasant Han Biyue said: "This class classification is really careful, and the masses have a clear vision. In the past, the cadres made the decisions, and the masses passed it in one night!" Some middle peasants said: "A few days ago, the workers didn't eat at my house, and they couldn't figure out the bottom line. After the class status was classified, they felt relieved and started to deliver manure."

    However, there are still shortcomings in the class classification. Some well-to-do middle peasants were not accurately calculated because the situation at that time was not clear. There are still many poor peasants among the lower-middle peasants. It is planned to establish a new peasants association and study it further.

    The Policy Was Not Handed Over to the Masses, Afraid of Paternalism, Made a Tail
    The shortcoming of this classification is that the policy spirit and the classification criteria were not made clear to the masses beforehand, and the workers were afraid of paternalism during the classification, resulting in tailism and abandonment of leadership. In the class classification, when the comrades of the work team participated in small group discussions separately, they were afraid of paternalism and dared not speak, sitting and listening. Even if they knew that the classification was wrong, they dared not propose a discussion, or the poor and hired peasants discussed it before they brought it up, forming mutual waiting and taking detours. The poor and hired peasants said: "You (referring to the workers) should speak up earlier. You understand the policy, and we know the reality. It is good to study together." This gave the workers a good criticism of abandoning leadership and tailism, and clarified that the masses demand leadership, and policy guidance is not paternalism.

### 大黄庄按政策讲实际　改正错订成份

　　大黄庄按政策讲实际
  　改正错订成份
    【襄垣消息】大黄庄过去共二百二十七户，以前划阶级，地主十五户、富农十五户、“破落地主”八户、富裕中农十户、中农十八户、下中农三十户、贫雇农一百零一户。地主富农占全村总户数百分之十七。划的方法是追三代，干部决定。
    这次贫农团正式成立后，大家认为开头第一件大事，就先把成份弄清楚，有的说划阶级好比定命，一定要按政策讲实际、民主讨论，该是什就是什。经过两天大小会热烈讨论，全村成份初步划清。地主十户、富农五户、富裕中农十二户、中农六十五户、下中农五十六户、贫雇农八十五户，总共二百三十三户（多了六户是以前分居的，过去把他们划成一户）。在划的当中，有地主王天顺的儿子王德先，原是穷人家的孩子，因家内无法生活，三岁上就给地主王天顺当了儿子，十来岁上就上地劳动，成人长大仍是受苦，虽然在地主家生活，但和人家吃两样饭，和雇工一样受苛刻虐待，他老婆是地主女人。过去划是地主，这次讨论后，贫雇认为地主王天顺财产应没收，王德先应脱离其地主家庭，和农民一样分得一份土地财产（他已参军了）。至于他女人必须参加劳动五年后，才能转变成份。一家人是两样成份、三样看待。以前错划了的苗雨顺老婆说：“过去将我划成地主真难受，今天摘了这顶帽，可算轻松了。咱就想不到今天还能和农民们到一块开会呀！”王考文说：“前几天我好比蚕上架，不愿吃也不想动，现在划成我中农，我觉的很合适，不是过去那样比圪堆办法”。中农韩必月说：“这次划阶级真细心，群众眼光看的清，过去是干部决定，群众开会一晚上就通过啦！”有些中农说：“前几天工作员不到俺家吃饭，摸不住底，划成份后才安了心，开始送粪。”
    但在划成份中仍有缺点，有些富裕中农因为当时情况没搞清，没算准确，下中农中仍有不少是贫农。计划成立起新农会再研究。
    没把政策交给群众　害怕包办做了尾巴
    这次划的缺点是没预先把政策精神和划的标准让群众了解清楚掌握，划时工作员又怕包办，产生尾巴主义放弃领导。在划阶级中，工作组同志分头参加小组讨论时，怕包办不敢发言坐着听，明知划的不对，也不敢提出讨论，或者是贫雇农讨论过去才提出来，形成互相等待走了弯路。贫雇说：“你们（指工作员）有话要早说，你们了解政策，我们知道实际，一块研究很好”。这样给了工作员放弃领导尾巴主义一个很好的批评，才明确了群众是要求领导的，政策指导不是包办。
