Xinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 19th: Frontline reporters report that the victory in the Luoyang Campaign has extremely important strategic significance for the People's Liberation Army's operations in the Central Plains and Northwest. This campaign severed the connection between Zhengzhou and Xi'an, increased the threat to those two cities, and greatly expanded and consolidated the 豫陕鄂 Liberated Area. This campaign fully exposed Chiang Kai-shek's gang's stretched forces, insufficient troops, and passive position of being attacked everywhere. Since the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in destroying the Pinghan Line in late December last year, Chiang Kai-shek urgently sought to restore his north-south transportation. After more than a month of planning, he transferred Hu Lian's army corps from the Dabie Mountains to attack Luohe to the north, and then extracted Hu Zongnan's Pei Changhui army corps from the Northwest to Zhengzhou to cooperate with Sun Yuanliang's army corps to attack Xuchang to the south. Just as the two Chiang Kai-shek forces from the north and south had just achieved a joint attack south of Zhengzhou in late February, the Northwest People's Liberation Army suddenly annihilated five entire brigades of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu bandits in Yichuan in early March. Xi'an was in urgent need of help, and Pei Changhui's army corps hurriedly moved west to save itself. At this time, our army launched an offensive against Luoyang and the Longhai Line. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to abandon the Pinghan Line and hastily sent Hu Lian and Sun Yuanliang's army corps to rescue Luoyang, but they were repeatedly blocked by our army and failed to advance. Luoyang had already been captured by us, and all the defending enemies were annihilated.

Luoyang is located at the strategic intersection of the three provinces of Qin, Jin, and Yu, and has been contested by military strategists throughout history. The terrain is easy to defend and difficult to attack. Chiang Kai-shek's defensive fortifications were completely based on the guidance of the American imperialist military advisory group and were heavily fortified. Chiang Kai-shek boasted that it was an "impregnable fortress." Qiu Xingxiang, commander of Chiang Kai-shek's 206th Division, once said in his "Letter to Soldiers on Defending Luoyang": "The safety of Luoyang is related to the success or failure of the entire war situation," so he wanted his soldiers to "either succeed or die for the cause." Therefore, even after the city was breached, he still tried to hold on to the core fortifications and stubbornly resisted, waiting for reinforcements. The Central News Agency also boasted: "Commander Qiu of Luoyang has a telegram saying that he is determined to fight to the last man and will not be discouraged in order to repay the Party and the country." As a result, Qiu Xingxiang neither "succeeded" nor "died for the cause," nor did he "fight to the last man." He is now alive as a prisoner under the preferential treatment of the People's Liberation Army. The Luoyang Campaign shows that our army, after land reform and study, has an unprecedentedly high fighting spirit, has promoted the spirit of military democracy, and has highly developed the wisdom and military art of the people's soldiers, finally conquering Chiang Kai-shek's boasted "impregnable fortress."

The soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's Youth Army 206th Division are mostly young students. After the Japanese surrender, Chiang Kai-shek prepared to use the Youth Army to train reserve officers as one of the capital for carrying out the civil war, and used the "convenience" and "preferential treatment" of "further education" and "career change" to deceive and lure young students to participate in the reactionary civil war, vainly attempting to use the flesh and blood of young students to make up for the shortage of troops. The division has undergone a long period of fascist education, but lacks practical combat experience. The inhuman Chiang Kai-shek used special agent supervision teams to strictly monitor, threaten, and even massacre, driving the division's soldiers to launch multiple counter-attacks in combat, but all were defeated. Many soldiers in the division regretted being deceived and were unwilling to be Chiang Kai-shek's victims. When the People's Liberation Army approached the attack, they immediately raised their hands to surrender. However, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents even used submachine guns to strafe them. The People's Liberation Army deeply regretted this loss of educated youth and patiently shouted at them from several strongholds to save them from the destruction of artillery fire. At the same time, they launched a fierce attack on the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who resolutely resisted and destroyed them with artillery fire. The soldiers of the 206th Division who were liberated were extremely grateful to the People's Liberation Army for their care and love for them even at the critical moment of life and death in the midst of fierce artillery battles. They all said: "If Chiang Kai-shek and Qiu Xingxiang had any humanity, they would not have let thousands of our classmates die like this." After liberation, the engineers automatically cleared landmines for our army, and many young soldiers with minor injuries also asked to join the People's Liberation Army and serve the people and the democratic cause. The students in Chiang Kai-shek's Youth Army should take the 206th Division as a warning, turn back quickly, break free from the net, and resolutely join the people's side.

The People's Liberation Army's urban policy and discipline have won unanimous praise from the citizens of Luoyang. The citizens risked enemy artillery fire to rescue our army's wounded, provide information, lead the way, deliver food, and transport supplies. In Luoyang, where Chiang Kai-shek once ruled strictly, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people was so high, fully demonstrating the combination of the invincible people in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas and the People's Liberation Army, making the people's liberation cause even greater and accelerating victory.

### 洛阳蒋匪高度设防终遭覆灭　证明我军攻无不克

　　洛阳蒋匪高度设防终遭覆灭
  　证明我军攻无不克
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十九日电】前线记者报道洛阳战役的胜利，对解放军在中原和西北的作战具有极重要的战略意义。这一战役斩断了郑州与西安间的联系，增加了对该两城的威胁，更大大扩大与巩固了豫陕鄂解放区。这一次战役充分暴露了蒋匪捉襟见肘兵力不足处处挨打。自去年十二月下旬，解放军破击平汉线大捷后，蒋匪急图恢复其南北交通，经一月余的筹划，从大别山抽调胡琏兵团北犯漯河，又从西北抽出胡宗南的裴昌会兵团到郑州协同孙元良兵团南犯许昌。正当南北两路蒋匪在二月下旬刚取得郑州以南的联击时，西北人民解放军于三月初突然在宜川接连歼灭蒋胡匪五个整旅，西安告急，裴昌会兵团又急忙西调自救。这时我军又发起对洛阳与陇海线的攻势，蒋匪被迫放弃平汉线，仓惶以胡琏及孙元良兵团赶救洛阳，节节遭我阻击，未能前进，而洛阳已经被我攻克，守敌也被全部歼灭。
    洛阳地扼秦晋豫三省要冲，为历代兵家所必争，地形易守难攻，蒋匪防御工事完全依照美帝军事顾问团的指导，高度设防，蒋匪自吹为“金城汤池”，蒋匪二○六师师长邱行湘在“保卫洛阳告将士书”中曾说：“洛阳的安危关系整个战局的成败”，因此要他的士兵“不是成功即是成仁”，故在城破后尚图坚守核心工事顽抗待援，中央社也吹嘘说：“洛阳邱师长现有电报，决战至最后一兵一卒亦不气馁，以报党国”。结果邱行湘既没有“成功”也没有“成仁”，更没有“战至最后一兵一卒”，他现在活着当了解放军优渥待遇下的俘虏。洛阳战役说明了我军经过土改学习后、战斗情绪空前昂扬，发扬了军事民主精神，高度发挥了人民战士的智慧和军事艺术，终于攻克了蒋匪自吹的“金城汤池”。
    蒋匪青年军二○六师士兵多系青年学生，日本投降后，蒋匪即准备以青年军培养预备军官，充作进行内战的资本之一，并以“升学”、“转业”的“便利”和“待遇”的“优厚”来欺骗诱惑青年学生参加反动内战，妄图以青年学生的血肉，去补兵力的不足。该师经过长时期的法西斯教育，但缺乏实战经验，毫无人性的蒋匪乃以特务督战队严格监视，威胁，甚至屠杀，驱使该师士兵在战斗中进行多次反冲锋，然亦均被击溃。该师很多士兵悔悟受骗，不愿作蒋贼的牺牲品，当解放军攻击接近时，即举手缴枪。但蒋匪特务竟以冲锋枪扫射他们。人民解放军对这些知识青年极为惋惜，曾在若干据点进行耐心的喊话，使他们免于炮火的毁灭。同时对坚决顽抗的蒋匪则施以猛烈的进攻，和炮火摧毁。获得解放的二○六师士兵，对人民解放军在炮火激战的生死关头还对他们备加体贴爱护极为感激。他们都说：“假使蒋介石和邱行湘有一点人性的话，也不该让我们几千同学这样送死”。解放后的工兵自动为我军扫除地雷，很多负轻伤的青年士兵也要求参加解放军，服务于人民和民主事业。蒋匪青年军中的学生们，应该以二○六师为前车之鉴，赶快回头，挣脱罗网，毅然投到人民方面来。
    解放军的城市政策和纪律，获得了洛阳市民一致的赞扬。市民们冒着敌人的炮火，救护我军伤员，供给情况，带路、送饭、搬运物资。在蒋匪曾经统治森严的洛阳，人民的革命情绪竟如此激昂，充分表现出不可征服的蒋管区人民和人民解放军的结合，使人民解放事业更加扩大和加速胜利。
