　　What to do with existing peasant associations in villages without work teams?
　　Editor:
　　I agree with the opinion in the "Reader-Editor Exchange" column on page one of the March 12th People's Daily that "the organization of fake peasant associations should be prohibited." Please answer the following: What should be done with the peasant associations that have already been organized in villages where work teams have not yet arrived? For example, in the semi-liberated areas of Xingtai, peasant associations have been organized in almost every village. Some are controlled by cadres (both good and bad), and some peasant associations do not allow any cadres to participate. Regardless of whether these peasant associations have cadres or not, they have not been reviewed by the masses and are somewhat impure. However, most of the members of the peasant associations are poor and hired peasants. Now, the work teams cannot go to these many villages to rectify them for the time being, and they cannot spare time to persuade the poor and hired peasants in these villages. If these peasant associations are disbanded, the poor and hired peasants will be dissatisfied; if they are not disbanded, they have not been reviewed by the masses and are somewhat impure. What should be done about these problems now during the production season?

Dehuai Comrade:
　　The already established peasant associations (mostly poor peasant groups) in various regions should have their continued existence, dissolution, or suspension of activities determined based on specific circumstances. However, one thing should be certain: in villages where work teams have not arrived, the central task is to launch spring plowing and production. The correct approach is to unite middle and poor peasants to create a mass-based production movement. If the already organized peasant organizations—peasant associations or poor peasant groups—that have not been correctly led cannot play a backbone role in production, cannot effectively unite middle peasants for production, or even engage in extortion of middle peasants, undermining the unity of middle and poor peasants, and affecting production, as has already happened in some places, then it proves that the internal composition of these peasant organizations is impure or controlled by bad elements. The leadership should resolutely order them to cease their activities and even disband their organizations.

　　Is it appropriate to establish a poor peasant group in Duzhuang?
　　Editor:
　　After reading Comrade Shang Yi's article on the 16th, I also think that the question of whether establishing peasant associations in villages like Zhaozhuang will isolate the poor peasants is indeed very important. It should be resolved not only from the organizational route but also from the specific demands of the poor and middle peasants in terms of ideological, political, and economic emancipation. Of course, the guiding ideology must be clear: taking the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, uniting all middle peasants, and jointly being masters of the house. However, in the actual implementation, many complex ideological problems will be encountered. In Duzhuang Village, from the initial mobilization of hired laborers to uniting middle peasants and organizing new peasant associations, we found that there were some differences in the organizational and economic demands between the poor and hired peasants who had not been emancipated or had not been thoroughly emancipated and the newly emancipated middle peasants (poor peasant stratum). For example, the un-emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated poor peasants viewed the newly emancipated middle peasants as follows: "They were activists in the past, and they could talk to the cadres. They have been emancipated well. We people (referring to those who have not been thoroughly emancipated), the cadres call us deadbeats and have never dared to make any suggestions to the cadres. We are not compatible with those activists (newly emancipated households). There are some differences in our hearts, and we cannot compare with them. We people are the real poor peasants, and we must be of one mind if we want to be emancipated well." This is what poor peasants Jia Bao and Xiao Hang said. Based on these circumstances, we in Duzhuang Village organized the un-emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated poor peasants into separate poor peasant groups, which will be more effective in guaranteeing the interests of the poor peasants' emancipation and the development of party rectification and democracy. At that time, we were also worried about whether doing so would isolate the poor and hired peasants. After this period of movement, facts have proved that as long as the guiding ideology clearly pays attention to uniting the middle peasants, the poor peasant groups will not be isolated, and they will soon consciously propose to establish new peasant associations to jointly be masters of the house with the new and old middle peasants and handle affairs together. The newly emancipated middle peasants believe that they were emancipated one or two years earlier than the un-emancipated poor and hired peasants, and they were all poor friends in the past. They guarantee that in this great program, they will first let the un-emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated poor peasants fill the gaps. In the development of the new peasant associations, the old middle peasants also quickly approached the poor peasants, expressing that they would no longer eat two-sided pancakes, stopped their wavering, and felt very intimately that the middle and poor peasants were one family. In the organization of the new peasant associations, the un-emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated poor and hired peasants formed a group (poor peasant group), the new middle peasants formed a group, and the old middle peasants formed a group, but the old middle peasants were willing to mix with the new middle peasants in one group. When electing the peasant association committee members, three poor peasants were elected, four new middle peasants were elected, and two old middle peasants were elected, for a total of nine people. At the conference, everyone said: We are three brothers born of the same mother, let us unite and jointly be masters of the house.
　　Is there any mistake in our approach in terms of organizational route? Is there any bias in uniting the middle peasants? Is it appropriate that the poor peasant group did not organize the new middle peasants into it? Will the poor peasant group be isolated by doing so? We believe that the above approach has also implemented the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Bureau. In addition to our joint research with the masses in the work of this village, and further exploration, we would also like to propose it for discussion and research with everyone.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hou Guoying
Guoying Comrade:
　　Whether a village should establish a poor peasant association or only establish a poor peasant group in the peasant association should be determined based on the specific situation of the village. According to the news from Duzhuang (see the Japanese version on the 22nd), middle peasants account for the majority of the village. It is feasible for you to adopt the method of establishing a poor peasant group with the un-emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated poor peasants, and then connecting the middle peasants to establish a new peasant association. It is also correct that the poor peasant group does not absorb the new middle peasants in the case of not establishing the poor peasant association. However, it seems that it would be better to mix the old and new middle peasants in the peasant association instead of grouping them separately.

　　编读往来
  　没有工作组的村已有的贫农团怎办？编辑同志：
    看到三月十二日人民日报一版编读往来一栏里有“应禁止组织假贫农团”的意见很对。请你们答复一下：已经组织起的贫农团，工作团尚未到这些村庄该怎办？如邢台半老区的地方，差不多都组织起贫农团，有的是干部掌握（好干部坏干部都有），有的贫农团不让一个干部参加，不管这些贫农团有没有干部，都没有经过群众审查，都有些不纯，可是贫农团里大部是贫雇。现在工作团暂时还不能到这许多村子去整顿，也顾不上去这些村子说服贫雇，若把这些贫农团解散了，贫雇就会不满；若不解散，没经过群众审查，多少有些不纯，现在正在生产时候，这些问题该怎办？　
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　刘德怀德怀同志：
    各地已成立的贫农团（贫农小组占多数），应根据具体情况确定其应继续存在、解散或停止活动等。但有一点应确定的，即工作团未到的村庄，工作中心是发动春耕生产，正确的作法，是中贫农团结起来造成群众性的生产运动。如果未经正确领导已经组织起来的贫农组织——贫农团或贫农小组，在生产中不能起骨干推动作用，不能很好的团结中农进行生产，甚至发生讹诈中农，破坏中贫农的团结，影响了生产，象有些地方已经产生的不好情形一样，那就证明这一种贫农组织，其内部成份不纯或被坏分子所掌握，领导上应坚决令其停止活动，以至解散其组织。

    杜庄成立贫农小组是否适当？编者同志：
    看到十六日报上尚义同志提出象赵庄一类的村，成立贫农团，是否会使贫农孤立？我也认为这个问题确实是很重要。不但从组织路线上解决，而且应当从贫农中农在思想上政治上及经济翻身的具体要求上解决。当然在指导思想上必须明确，以贫雇为骨干，团结全体中农，共同当家作主。但在真正实际的实现中，会遇到许多复杂的思想问题。我们在杜庄村，由开始入手发动分雇，到团结中农，组织新农会，发现未翻身与翻身不透的贫雇与新翻身的中农（贫农层），在组织与经济要求上是有些差别的。如未翻身或翻不透的贫农对新翻身的中农看法是：“人家过去是积极分子，伢也能和干部说上话，伢翻好啦。俺们这伙人（指没有翻透的户），伢干部叫俺是死落后，从来也不敢向干部提个意见，咱和人家积极分子（新翻身户）组织在一块不相衬。在心肝眼上也有些不一样，不能和人家比。俺们这伙人才是真正穷农（贫农），要想翻好身，总得一条心。”这是贫农贾保和小杭说的。根据这些情况，我们杜庄村以未翻身或翻身不透的贫农单独组织贫农小组，在保证贫农翻身的利益上及整党民主的开展上更会有力。当时我们也顾虑到这样作是否会使贫雇孤立起来？经过这个时期的运动，事实证明，只要在指导思想上明确注意团结中农，贫农小组不会孤立，而且很快的由他们（贫雇）自觉的提出成立新农会，与新老中农一块当家作主，大家办事。在新翻身的中农，认为自己比未翻身的贫雇是早翻了一、二年身，过去都是穷朋友，保证这次闹大纲，先让伢翻身不透或未翻身的贫农填起圪道来。在发展新农会中，老中农也很快的靠近贫农，表示自己再不吃两面烧饼啦，停止了他们的动摇，很亲切的感到中贫农是一家。在新农会的组织中，翻不透或未翻身的贫雇组成一块（贫农组），新中农为一组，老中农为一组，但老中农愿与新中农混合组织在一块。在选举农会委员时，贫农当选三人，新中农当选四人，老中农当选二人，共九人。大会上都说：咱们是一母所生的兄弟三人，团结起来共同当家作主。
    我们这样的作法在组织路线上是否有错误？在团结中农上是否有偏向？贫农小组未将新中农组织进去是否妥当？这样作贫农小组是否会孤立？我们认为以上的作法也是贯彻了中共中央与中央局的指示精神，除我们在该村的工作中与群众共同研究，进一步的摸索外，并愿提出与大家商讨研究。
  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　侯国英国英同志：
    一个村该不该成立贫农团或只在农会中成立贫农小组，应以一个村的具体情况来确定。根据杜庄消息（见二十二日本版），中农已占全村的多数，你们采取以未翻身或翻身不透的贫农成立贫农小组，并即串连中农成立新农会是可以的。在不再成立贫农团的情况下，贫农小组不吸收新中农也是对的，但你们把老中农、新中农在农会中分别编组，似乎不如以混合编组为好。
