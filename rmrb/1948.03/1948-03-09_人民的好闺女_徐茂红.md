The People's Good Daughter
Xu Maohong

Xu Maohong, a member of the Farmers' Association of Cangma County (newly established county) in the Binhai District of Jiaodong, came from a poor background. She begged for food, worked as a servant girl, and was a child bride until the liberation of her hometown at the age of eighteen, when she finally turned over a new leaf. Because she actively helped poor brothers and sisters to stand up, she was elected as a member of the district women's association. During the land reform review last autumn, she was a banner in the county for mobilizing the poor and hired peasants and uniting the middle peasants to follow the mass line. But later it was discovered that there were still beggars. The district sent her to understand and solve the problem of this village. She first found Liu Da Niang, who was begging for food. Liu Da Niang had just returned from begging and was warming up leftover food. Xu joined her in eating. Liu Da Niang was surprised at the time and said, "Comrade! What beggars eat is something that pigs and dogs don't eat. How can the cadres (referring to working cadres) eat it?" Xu ate while describing her own difficulties in begging for food in Zhucheng when she was young. She slept with Liu Da Niang at night. Liu Da Niang embarrassedly pointed to the torn mat on the kang and said, "Don't laugh at me, Comrade! I have nothing to lay on and nothing to cover myself with. How can you sleep here?" Xu Maohong told her about her own suffering when she was thirteen years old, when she begged for food in Zhucheng, sleeping under the snow and covering herself with the sky, and when she worked as a servant girl for the landlord, sleeping on the ground covered with a dustpan. On this dark night, Liu Da Niang also cried out all the grievances she had suffered in her life, and also told of her grievances in turning over a new leaf. She had originally only been allocated one jin of pork and two sheng of grain, but later the staff member listened to the landlord and scared her by saying, "Eating one jin of pork will cost you ten jin of human flesh." Since then, she dared not even mention turning over a new leaf. Liu Da Niang hugged Xu Maohong and sobbed, "My good daughter, I never thought that there would be someone in the world who would accompany us poor people." The next day, Liu Da Niang met people and said, "Our village has good fortune! Good people have come to our village to lead us to turn over a new leaf. Everyone come to my house and listen to her enlighten us!" All eighteen poor and hired peasant households in the village came to Xu Maohong and explained the true situation of the village clearly. The work truly began from then on.

Xu Maohong never separates herself from the masses, and the masses have never looked at her as an outsider. Everyone affectionately calls her "daughter" or "elder sister." She helps the masses to work, eat and sleep together, not simply for investigation or "going deep." She feels that all the suffering people are like her mother and like herself when she was a servant girl. Therefore, their turning over a new leaf is as urgent as her own. Many cadres who learn her working methods feel that they cannot bear it, but Xu Maohong said: "Our one day of work is at most comparable to one day of labor for the masses. The masses have been doing this every day for many generations. We complain about being tired from work, but what should the people do?" This true class consciousness and mass viewpoint, as well as her simple and meticulous working style, have made her universally loved by the masses, and also enabled her to open up situations in places where others cannot carry out their work.

　　人民的好闺女
  　徐茂红
    胶东滨北分区藏马县（新设县）农会委员徐茂红，出身贫苦，从小讨饭，当丫头，做童养媳，直到十八岁那年家乡解放后才翻了身。因为她积极帮助穷苦兄弟姊妹翻身，被选为区妇会委员，去秋土改复查中，她是全县发动贫雇，团结中农走群众路线的一面旗子。但后来发现有讨饭的。区里派她去了解和解决这庄的问题，她就首先找到讨饭的刘大娘家里，刘大娘讨饭刚回来，正在温剩饭吃，徐就和她一块吃起来，刘大娘当时惊奇的说：“同志！讨饭的人吃的都是猪狗不吃的东西，工作上（指干部）怎么能吃下去？”徐一面吃一面叙述她自己当初讨饭的困难情形，晚上和刘大娘一起睡，刘大娘难为情的指着炕上的破席说：“叫同志笑话要铺无铺的，要盖无盖的，同志怎么能睡呢？”徐茂红便向她诉说自己十三岁那年到诸城讨饭时铺着雪盖着天睡，以及给地主当丫头时在地上盖着簸箕睡觉的苦楚。就在这天黑夜，刘大娘也把她一辈子受的委曲哭诉了出来，又把她在翻身中的委曲诉了出来，她原来只分到一斤猪肉二升粮食，后来工作员听了地主话又吓唬她说：“吃斤猪肉还十斤人肉”，从此翻身也不敢提了。刘大娘抱着徐茂红哽咽的说：“我的好闺女，想不到天下还有和俺穷苦人做伴的”。第二天，刘大娘碰见人便说：“咱村有洪福哩，好人来咱村领导翻身了，大家都到俺家听她开导开导吧！”全村十八家的贫雇农都来找徐茂红，把这庄的实情说了个明明白白，工作也就从此真正开始。
    徐茂红从来不把自己和群众分开看，而群众也从未外看她，大家都亲热的叫她“闺女”或“大姐”，她帮助群众去干活，一起吃睡，不是单纯为了调查或为了“深入”，她觉得凡是受苦的人都和她母亲以及她当丫头时是一样的，因此他们的翻身和她自己的翻身一样迫切，很多干部学习她的工作方法都觉得受不住，但是徐茂红却说：“我们一天工作顶多比上群众一天的劳动，群众天天如此，已经多少辈子了，我们工作嫌累，而老百姓又该怎么办呢？”这种真正的阶级自觉和群众观点，以及朴实细心的工作作风，使她得到群众普遍的爱戴，也使她能在别人无法开展工作的地方，打开局面。（新华社）
