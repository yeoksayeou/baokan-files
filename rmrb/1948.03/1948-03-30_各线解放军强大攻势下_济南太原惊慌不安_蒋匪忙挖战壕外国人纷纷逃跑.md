Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th. News from Jinan states: Recently, Jinan City has been shaken by the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. Citizens in the streets and alleys are whispering to each other, and even the military police are discussing and expecting the People's Liberation Army to enter the city and liberate them as soon as possible. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are extremely panicked, and prices in the city are rising several times a day. Bandit chieftain Wang Yaowu, after the disastrous defeat of his reorganized 32nd Division, hurriedly strengthened the city's defenses. Currently, the three gates of Jinan City are tightly closed, with only Puli Gate open for passage. Workers from various factories are being forced to dig trenches around the city, and work has been suspended. Bandit Wang has also transferred and adjusted the 73rd Division, the 111th Brigade of the Reorganized 12th Division, the 211th Brigade of the Reorganized 45th Division (according to reports, this brigade was rebuilt after being annihilated in the Jiahe campaign last year) and the 213th Brigade from along the Jinpu Railway and Laiwu and other places to concentrate in Jinan in an attempt to defend it to the death. According to a Reuter's dispatch from Peiping on the 21st, Wang Yaowu's family has recently left Jinan and fled to Qingdao, causing a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic officials and foreigners to flee. More than half of the foreign faculty and staff of Qilu University, as well as ten Americans, sixteen Britons and four Canadians, have been evacuated from Jinan. The dispatch also revealed that the poor people of Jinan City hope that the People's Liberation Army will "break through the gates."

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th. Under the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts, Yan Xishan's bandits are extremely panicked. Yan-occupied cities in the central Shanxi counties are stepping up their defenses. The people of Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Wenshui, Jiaocheng and other places are being forced to rush to repair fortifications, and civilian carts are being requisitioned to transport bricks and grain. The houses, temples and graves in many villages have been demolished. In Fenyang, Xiaoyi and other places, Yan's bandits are forcing the people to organize "self-defense forces" to carry out exercises such as fire extinguishing and well filling. The gates of Qingyuan City are blocked with sandbags, and people from outside the city are forbidden to enter. In Taiyuan City, the heart of Yan's bandits, people are even more alarmed and prices are soaring. Millet has soared to 80,000 yuan per catty, and white flour is 120,000 yuan per catty.
