Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: According to Shanghai newspaper reports, Yongchang, Gaolan, and other counties in the KMT-controlled areas of Gansu suffered from frost, hail, severe drought, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's continued疯狂 extortion. Farmers' lives have become unsustainable. Old and young disaster victims in Yongchang are fleeing to Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Last winter, more than 20 farmers from Wulong Township in the county attempted to cross the Qilian Mountains to find food in Qinghai. When they reached Dayunban, they all froze to death. Later, passersby discovered the dead embracing each other, stiff and lying under the snow, a very tragic sight. The disaster victims remaining in their hometowns, such as the 140,000 disaster victims in Gaolan County, are still being forced by Chiang Kai-shek bandits to pay 16,000 dan of military grain and "land tax" grain. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit land and grain office in Yongchang County even organized a large number of "sweeping and collecting teams" to go to various townships to carry out looting. Disaster victims who could not pay the grain not only had their livestock "swept away," but also young disaster victims were forcibly conscripted into the army or forced to do hard labor. In the Aganzhen coal mine, 46 miles outside Zongtangmen in Lanzhou, there are more than 1,000 workers who were captured disaster victims. They are forced by Chiang Kai-shek bandits to work as slaves, and their lives are worse than livestock.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: According to news from the KMT-controlled areas, KMT "grain administration" henchmen in various parts of Yangzhou, Jiangsu, have set up grain shops to exploit farmers. Zhu Shaoqing, deputy director of the KMT Tianliang Office in the county, and Wu Xizhen, director of the KMT Shaobo Tianliang Office, jointly opened the Zhen Sen Tai Grain Shop in Shaobo Town in the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, specializing in "land tax" and "collection on behalf," calculating a six-and-a-half-jin basket on the scale as eight jin, and also collecting an additional seven jin per dan; resulting in an extra eight and a half jin to be paid per dan, equivalent to 200,000 KMT currency. Such "grain shops" have been established throughout the county and in nearby Xiannvmiao, Guazhou, and other places. Furthermore, the KMT "grain quota" for Tanjin in the province reached 40,000 dan in Zhixi district alone. In addition, there are so-called "county-level expenses," "additional township granary reserves," and "fine grain," so that farmers' entire harvest is extorted by 70 to 80 percent. Farmers hate Chiang Kai-shek bandits and yearn for the People's Liberation Army to rescue them. On January 5, the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Grain Office in Qiaozhen originally planned to collect more than 2,500 dan of grain in one day, but because of rumors that "the New Fourth Army arrived west of Changshu last night, crossed the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and came south," the farmers refused to pay grain, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit bloodsuckers looted only more than 50 dan before fleeing in panic.

　　甘肃惨遭天灾蒋祸
  　人民生活不如牛马
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据沪报消息：甘肃蒋管区永昌、皋兰等县，去年曾遭霜雹酷旱等灾，加以蒋匪政府继续疯狂勒索，农民生活已无法维持，永昌灾民老幼相率往宁夏、新疆、青海等地逃亡。去冬该县五龙乡农民二十余人欲越祈连山往青海觅食，行至大云坂地方，全部冻毙，后经路人发现死者互相拥抱，僵卧于积雪下，为状甚惨。残留于家乡灾民，如皋兰全县十四万灾民，仍被蒋匪强迫缴纳一万六千担军粮及“田赋”粮。永昌县蒋匪田粮处更组织大批“扫征队”，赴各乡镇进行洗劫，缴不起粮食的灾民不仅牲口被“扫征”，即年青灾民亦被强迫抓去当兵或做苦工。兰州宗棠门外四十六里的阿干镇煤矿，即有千余名工人系被抓来的灾民，他们被蒋匪逼迫着做奴隶劳动，生活比牛马不如。
    【新华社华东二十六日电】据蒋区消息：江苏扬州各地蒋匪“粮政”爪牙设立粮行，敲榨农民。该县蒋匪田粮处副处长朱少卿，及蒋匪邵伯田粮办事处主任吴锡珍等联合于去年阴历十月间在邵伯镇开设镇森泰粮行，专办“田赋”“代征”，以六斤半箩筐上秤算作八斤，另外每担还多收七斤；致每担须多缴八斤半，折合蒋币二十万元。此类“粮行”已遍设该县境内及附近之仙女庙，瓜洲等各地。又讯：该省坛金蒋匪“征粮配额”仅直溪一个区即达四万担，此外尚有所谓“县级经费”、“附加乡仓积谷”、“罚谷”等，农民全部收获量被勒索达百分之七、八十。农民均仇恨蒋匪，渴盼人民解放军去解救他们。一月五日该县桥镇蒋匪田粮办事处原拟于一天内勒收食粮二千五百多担，但因传说“昨夜新四军到常熟西边，过了京沪铁路向南来了，”农民即拒绝缴粮，蒋匪吸血爪牙勒索了五十多担即仓皇逃窜。
