　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Increases Taxes
    Exploits the People
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Comprehensive reports from various sources: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government is once again plundering the people by implementing tax increases. Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek personally presented a new extortion plan to the bandit gang's "State Council" on February 27, planning to increase salt tax by 15 trillion yuan, and tobacco and alcohol tax by 4 trillion yuan. According to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' tax increase in January this year, in addition to the salt tax increase of 150 percent and the import tariff increase of 50 percent, the commodity tax and cigarette tax increased by an average of 98 percent, and the beverage tax also increased by about 150 percent. The business tax rates and business license tax rates levied on industrial, commercial and general consumers have also doubled. Furthermore, news: Checkpoints are everywhere in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, with layers of extortion. In Jixi, southern Anhui, transporting pigs to Tunxi, which is only about a hundred miles away, requires paying taxes four times, and most pig merchants lose even their capital. The Anqing Chiang Kai-shek gang is also levying "cargo transit taxes" on salt, cotton, vegetable oil, grain, etc. under the guise of building "city defense works." On the transportation lines of eastern Jiangxi counties, Chiang Kai-shek bandits densely set up checkpoints. Each stone of grain has to pay a tax of 50,000 yuan, and each piece of foreign yarn costs 3 million to 5 million yuan. The Xuzhou Chiang Kai-shek gang is also extorting as much as 20 billion yuan from merchants and civilians under the guise of constructing a "140-mile city defense line."

　　蒋匪增税
    搜刮人民
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合各方消息：蒋匪政府再度通过实行增税，掠夺人民。匪首蒋介石二月二十七日亲向匪帮“国务会议”提出新的勒索计划，计增加盐税十五万亿元，及烟酒税四万亿元。按今年一月蒋匪曾一度增税，除盐税增加百分之一百五十，进口关税增加百分之五十外，货物税、卷烟税平均增加百分之九十八，饮料品税也增加百分之一百五十左右。征课工商业及一般消费者的营业税率和营业牌照税率亦均增加一倍。又息：蒋区各地关卡林立，层层敲诈，皖南绩溪运猪到屯溪，相隔不过百里，需纳税四次之多，猪商大多连本蚀光。安庆蒋匪帮更在修筑“城防工事”名义下，加征盐、棉花、植物油、粮食等“货物转运税”。赣东各县交通线上蒋匪密布检查站卡，粮食每石须缴税五万元，洋纱每件三百万至五百万元。徐州蒋匪帮亦在构筑“一百四十里城防线”名义下，勒索商民达二百亿元之巨。
