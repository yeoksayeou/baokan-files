Victory Follows Victory
Our Army's Offensive Sweeps Across North and South
60,000 Bandits Annihilated, 11 Cities Captured in Half a Month

The powerful offensive operations of the People's Liberation Army have vigorously unfolded on all fronts, both north and south. Victory follows victory, with triumphant news pouring in from Northeast China and the areas along the Huai, Han, and Yellow Rivers. The two great victories of capturing Siping in the north and Luoyang in the south on the 13th were particularly glorious. Reuters described it as the darkest day in the Kuomintang's twenty years of civil war. Currently, the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army is expanding on a large scale in various locations. According to the published results for just the first half of March, we have captured eleven cities: Yichuan, Ganquan, Xunyi, Yijun,中部(Zhongbu), Baishui in Shaanxi; Luoyang in Henan; Siping and Jilin in Northeast China; Suyang in Northern Jiangsu; and Taihe in Northern Anhui, annihilating over 60,000 enemies. Not long ago, the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army commented on the great victory in Yichuan, pointing out: "After winter training, our field armies will soon launch a spring offensive." The current situation indicates that the prelude to the spring offensive has begun, and new victories will follow one after another on all fronts.

This offensive began first in the Northwest. After the great victory in Yichuan at the beginning of the month, the Northwest Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to drive southwards. On the 5th, they captured Ganquan; from the night of the 9th to the 10th, they swept through the four cities of 中部(Zhongbu), Yijun, Baishui, and Xunyi. Over a hundred local defense troops stationed in 中部(Zhongbu) gloriously revolted. Our army has now cut off the Xianyang-Yan'an highway, a key transportation route for the bandit Hu Zongnan in Northern Shaanxi, and completed the encirclement of Yan'an and Luochuan, placing the 20,000 Hu Zongnan bandits in these two cities in a desperate situation. The choice between life, death, honor, and disgrace has reached its final moment. The Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit gang in Xi'an is in a state of extreme panic.

At the same time, our Central Plains Army directly targeted the important town of Luoyang. After clearing enemy outposts, our army launched a general offensive against the city on the night of the 9th. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, we broke through the enemy's heavily fortified modern group fortifications and completely ended the battle on the evening of the 13th, liberating Luoyang and annihilating over 10,000 enemy troops, including the Youth Army's 206th Division. Division Commander Qiu Xingxiang and Chief of Staff Fu Shaoji were captured alive. The great victories in Yichuan and Luoyang have laid a solid foundation for the liberation of Northwest China and the entire Huai, Han, and Yellow River regions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram congratulating the Central Plains combat troops and encouraging them: "Continue your efforts and fight for the liberation of the entire Huai, Han, and Yellow River regions."

In Northeast China, after capturing the important supply port of Yingkou and the strategic location of Xin Kaiyuan at the end of last month, our army continued to besiege Shenyang and launched an offensive against Sipingjie, a key point connecting the east-west and north-south Manchurian railways. Our army launched a general offensive at 8:00 AM on the 12th. After twenty-three hours of fierce fighting, this strong strategic fortress, built with modern permanent fortifications, was completely destroyed. The battle was completely resolved at 7:00 AM on the 13th, and the enemy's elite 71st Army, 88th Division, and other units, totaling more than 19,000 men, were completely annihilated. Another unit of the Liberation Army recovered Yongji City, the capital of Jilin Province, on the 9th. The enemy's 60th Army abandoned all its valuables and supplies and fled in panic towards Changchun. We pursued and annihilated more than 4,000 of them. Now, Changchun is the only remaining major stronghold north of Shenyang for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northeast China. They have no way to escape, and if they do not surrender, they will only be annihilated.

Under the victorious offensive of our field armies, the People's Liberation Army and local armed forces in various southern areas actively cooperated in combat, launching attacks, harassing the enemy, clearing out local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and recovering towns and strongholds, achieving repeated victories. The Northwest Sanbian Local Corps captured Ning Tiao Liang, an important town 35 kilometers southeast of Anbian County, on the 10th, capturing alive the puppet Jingbian County Magistrate Han Ziqian and over 120 officers and soldiers. The Yan'an Prefecture Guerrilla Brigade has been active in the area between Yan'an and Laoshan for days, sabotaging enemy roads and telegraph lines, and destroying many enemy pillboxes. At the beginning of this month, the Taiyue Local Armed Forces successively recovered the three important crossing points of Fenglingdu, Taiyangdu, and Shawo Du on the north bank of the Yellow River in Southern Shanxi, completely eliminating the enemy's last three bridgeheads in Southern Shanxi. The local armed forces of the Yushane'e Fourth Military Sub-district captured Jingziguan, a transportation hub connecting the three provinces, on the 7th, annihilating more than 900 enemy troops. Our army in the Yuwansu area recaptured Taihe in Northern Anhui on the 6th, annihilating a battalion of the 74th Division and over 1,500 puppet troops. On the 6th, our army in Northern Jiangsu recovered Suyang City and its surrounding Xin'an Town, Yinping, Gaoliu, Longgou, and more than ten strongholds, annihilating over a hundred fleeing enemies. Now, there are no enemy traces in the vast area extending 200 li east and west of Suyang City, and from the Nantong-Ganyu line south to Lianshui and north to Dayishan for 150 li.

　　胜利紧接胜利
  　南北各线我军攻势猛烈展开
    半月歼匪六万克城市十一座
    解放军强大的攻势作战已在南北各线猛烈展开，胜利紧接胜利，从东北和江淮河汉各地纷纷传来，十三日一天两大捷，北克四平南下洛阳，胜利尤为辉煌，路透社称之为国民党二十年来内战中最黑暗的一天。现解放军胜利攻势正在各地大规模扩展中。仅据三月份上半月已公布的战果，我攻克城市已达十一座，即：陕西的宜川、甘泉、＠县、宜君、中部、白水；河南的洛阳；东北的四平、吉林；苏北的＠阳；皖北的太和，歼敌六万余人。不久前解放军总部评论宜川大捷时即曾指出：“我各野战军经冬季整训后，不久即将展开春季攻势作战”。目前形势预告春季攻势的序幕已揭，各线新的胜利将接踵而来。
    此次攻势首先自西北开始，月初宜川大捷后，西北解放军即乘胜长驱南下，五日克甘泉，九日夜至十日席卷中部、宜君、白水、＠县四城，中部守敌地方团队百余人光荣起义。现我大军已切断陕北胡匪交通干线咸阳至延安公路，完成对延安、洛川两城包围，使该两城胡匪两万余人面临覆灭绝境，生死荣辱的抉择已到最后关头。西安蒋胡匪帮更是恐慌万状。
    与此同进，我中原大军直指洛阳重镇，我军于扫除敌外围据点后，九日夜发起对该城的总攻，经四昼夜激战，突破敌层层布防的现代化集团工事，十三日晚全部结束战斗，解放洛阳城，悉数歼灭守敌青年军二○六师等部万余人，师长邱行湘、参谋长符绍基均被生俘。宜川及洛阳大捷，已为解放大西北及整个江淮河汉地区打下了巩固的胜利的基础。中共中央曾驰电致贺中原作战部队并共勉：“继续努力，为解放整个江淮河汉地区而战”。
    东北我军于上月底攻克重要补给港口营口城及战略要地新开原后，继续围困沈阳，并发动对贯通东西南北满铁路连结点的四平街的进攻。我军于十二日上午八时发起总攻，经二十三小时激战，尽毁此一构筑有现代化永久性工事堡垒的强固战略要塞，十三日七时全部解决战斗，全歼守敌嫡系精锐七十一军八十八师等部一万九千余名。另部解放军则于九日收复吉林省会永吉城，守敌六十军尽弃细软辎重，仓惶向长春逃命，我追歼其四千余名。现在东北蒋匪在沈阳以北的重要据点，只剩下长春一座死城，逃亡无路，如不投降，只有被歼。
    在我野战大军胜利攻势下，南线我各地解放军及地方武装积极配合作战，纷纷出击，牵制袭击敌人，清剿土蒋匪，收复城镇据点，迭获胜利。西北三边地方兵团十日攻克安边县城东南三十五公里的重镇宁条梁，活捉伪靖边县长韩子谦以下官兵一百二十余人。延属分区游击队连日活跃于延安劳山间，破坏敌人公路电线，烧毁敌碉堡多处。太岳地方武装本月初先后收复晋南黄河北岸的风陵渡、太阳渡、沙窝渡等三个重要渡口，将敌在晋南最后的三个桥头堡垒彻底拔除。豫陕鄂四分区地方武装，七日攻克三省交通咽喉荆紫关，歼灭守敌九百余。豫皖苏我军六日再克皖北太和，歼敌整七十四师一个营及伪杂一千五百余名。苏北我军六日收复＠阳城及其周围之新安镇、阴平、高流、龙沟等十余据点，歼逃敌百余，现＠阳城东西二百里，南（通）赣（榆）线南至涟水，北到大伊山一百五十里广大地区已无敌踪。（三月十一日至十七日）
