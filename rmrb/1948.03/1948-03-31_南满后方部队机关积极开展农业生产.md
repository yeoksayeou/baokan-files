Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: Rear echelon units in Southern Manchuria are flexibly and vigorously organizing production campaigns. The Liaodong Military Region has recently established a Production Committee to lead subordinate units in carrying out large-scale production work, focusing on agriculture. Regulations stipulate that this year, the production tasks of all organs should achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables and daily necessities for half a year. In addition, each person must cultivate an average of half a mu of wasteland, every 100 people must raise six pigs, and they must grind their own grain for daily consumption. Strict adherence to staffing levels is required, ensuring no idle personnel, vehicles, or horses. In the production campaign, leaders of various organs and units personally take action to provide specific guidance and launch production merit campaigns. Currently, specific plans for each unit have been formulated successively, and work such as collecting fertilizer and scientifically organizing labor is underway. The Logistics Department of the Military Region has decided to cultivate 180 mu of wasteland, expecting to harvest 23,000 jin of grain, sufficient to provide self-sufficiency in grain for three months and vegetables for the entire year. The Liaoning Military Region and various organs of the provincial government are also actively developing production while conserving resources in preparation for lean times. The provincial government stipulates that each person cultivate an average of three mu of land and pay attention to saving more grain during ordinary times. Many units began accumulating fertilizer as early as July last year, sufficient to fertilize over 100 mu of land. They are currently organizing vehicles and horses to step up transportation. Various organs in Andong are also vigorously organizing production work. The provincial government strictly criticized the erroneous thinking of using the excuse of being busy with work and relying on exploiting the labor of others to complete production tasks, and put forward the concept that production and conservation are the concepts of war and the masses. Currently, mutual aid through labor exchange, equal pay for equal work, profit sharing, and rewards have generally been implemented, so as not to delay ordinary work and to promote each person's strengths. Subordinate organs of the Southern Liaoning Administrative Office, under the principle of not hindering office work, are divided into groups to collect manure in shifts, with groups competing with each other. As of the beginning of the month, the communications class, guard team, and secretariat had collected more than 9,000 jin of manure.

　　南满后方部队机关积极开展农业生产
    【新华社东北二十九日电】南满各后方部队机动地、大力组织生产运动。辽东军区近已成立生产委员会领导所属各单位开展以农业为主的大生产工作，规定今年各机关之生产任务做到半年蔬菜及日用品自给外，每人必须平均开荒半亩，每百人养猪六口，平时自食粮食亦须自磨，并严格遵守编制，做到没有闲人闲车闲马。在生产运动中各机关部队首长均亲自动手具体领导，并展开生产立功运动。现各单位之具体计划已先后拟订，进行了搜集肥料，及科学组织劳动力等工作。军区后勤部已决定开荒一百八十亩，预计可打粮二万三千斤，足以自给三个月的粮食及全年的菜蔬。辽宁军区及省政府各机关亦在节约备荒中积极开展生产。省政府规定平均每人种地三亩，平时要注意多节省粮食。许多单位早于去年七月即开始积肥，可施地百余亩，现正组织车马，加紧运送。安东各机关亦正大力组织生产工作，省府机关严格批评了借口工作忙和依靠剥削旁人劳动力来交生产任务的错误思想，并提出生产节约就是战争观念与群众观念，现一般已实行变工互助，等价计工，分红提奖等办法，使不致耽误平时工作，且又能发扬各人之特长。辽南行署所属各机关在不妨碍办公原则下，分组轮流出外拾粪，组与组之间互相竞赛，截至月初为止，通讯班，警卫队，秘书处各单位共已拾粪九千余斤。
