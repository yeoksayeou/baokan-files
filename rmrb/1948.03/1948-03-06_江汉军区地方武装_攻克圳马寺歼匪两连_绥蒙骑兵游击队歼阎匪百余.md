Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 4th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army's local armed forces, active on the north bank of the Yangtze River, liberated the Jiang bandit stronghold of Zhenma Temple, more than ninety li southeast of Jiangling County, on February 22nd, completely annihilating the two companies of the Hubei Provincial New Security First Regiment stationed there. A total of over 40 enemies were killed, over 220 were captured (including those below the rank of deputy battalion commander), and the following items were seized: 4 heavy machine guns, 8 light machine guns, 150 long and short guns, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, and a portion of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Suyuwan Front, 4th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army strictly observed urban discipline in the battle to capture Bo County. As soon as the battle ended, the combat troops withdrew from the city, and the city was maintained by the pickets and city defense troops. The masses were not disturbed in the slightest and immediately resumed normal business operations. The Party Committee of a certain unit specially issued a commendation and pointed out the reasons for the good urban discipline: 1. Before the battle, universal and in-depth mobilization was carried out, and it was proposed that "a good battle but poor discipline does not count as completing the task." 2. Through land reform studies, the concept of the masses has been strengthened. 3. Pickets were organized before the war to be conscientious and responsible, impartial, and to cooperate closely with local party and government personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 3rd: The Suiyuan-Mongolia Cavalry Guerrilla Force, in coordination with the local armed forces of Jin-Cha-Ji, defeated a part of Yan's 38th Division and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Security Corps, who had come out of Datong to grab food in the Feng (zhen) Dong area on February 17th. Over 60 bandits were killed or wounded, over 40 bandits were captured alive, and the following items were seized: 2 small cannons, 6 light and heavy machine guns, and 54 long and short guns. The remaining bandits fled back to Datong in panic.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: The People's Liberation Army released 412 Chiang Kai-shek officers below the rank of colonel, who had been liberated in the Jiahe, Zhucheng, and Gaomi campaigns last year, to return to their hometowns, including Qiu Chonglun, Colonel Stationmaster of the 19th Supply Station; Zhang Xianchen, Lieutenant Colonel Commander of the 1st Regiment of the 211th Brigade of the Reorganized 45th Division; Wang Wenhan, Lieutenant Colonel Commander of the 3rd Regiment; Wang Liangzheng, Major Deputy Commander of the Regiment; and Zhan Deyi, Third Class Military Doctor of the 475th Regiment of the 159th Brigade of the Reorganized 64th Division.
