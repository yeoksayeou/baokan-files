　　Shanghai Rice Price
  　Reaches 4.5 Million
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] According to foreign news agency reports: Three weeks after the Jiang-US hyped "grain rationing" was implemented, Shanghai rice prices continued to soar. On the 21st, the price reached 4.5 million per shi, three times the highest rice price during the first price storm in the Jiang area this year. Shanghai rice merchants all emphasized: they "have never seen any sign of the endlessly soaring rice prices falling."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] According to foreign news agency reports on the 17th: Under the fierce attack of the second economic storm, workers of the Shanghai British-owned Tram Company have issued a final warning to the company, stating that unless the company agrees to increase the year-end bonus and increase wages at the time of promotion, all workers will go on strike. At the same time, staff members of the Jiang bandit Central News Agency's broadcasting department, protesting the agency's delayed payment of meager salaries and allowances, held a sit-down strike for three hours until the Jiang bandit Nanjing Central Headquarters was forced to agree to pay salaries immediately, at which point they resumed work.

　　上海米价
  　达四百五十万
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据外国通讯社消息：蒋美喧嚣一时之“粮食配售”实行三周后，上海米价仍继续暴涨，二十一日每石已达四百五十万，为今年蒋区第一次物价风暴时最高米价的三倍。沪市米商均强调指出：他们“从未看出暴涨不已的米价有下跌的任何迹象”。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据外国通讯社十七日消息：在二次经济风暴猛烈袭击下，上海英商电车公司工人已向公司方面提出最后警告称：除非公司同意增发年终赏金，及升级时同时增加工资等要求，全体工人即将举行罢工。与此同时蒋匪中央社广播部职员为抗议该社迟发低微之薪水及津贴，曾举行静坐罢工三小时，直至蒋匪南京中央总社被迫答应立即发薪时始复工。
