Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to Washington sources: A letter from U.S. Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington, transmitted to the U.S. Congress by Marshall on the 27th, admitted a secret plan by the U.S. imperialists, under the smokescreen of "peaceful mediation," to build an air force for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and encourage Chiang Kai-shek to launch and continue the civil war of massacring the Chinese people. The plan was established in a secret US-Chiang agreement approved in July 1946 when Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale civil war, called the "Eight and One-Third Air Force Groups" plan. According to this plan, the United States used 1,071 aircraft, in the form of "cheap sale," to organize for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits a heavy bomber group, a medium bomber group, four single-engine fighter groups, two transport aircraft groups, and a photographic reconnaissance squadron. The United States also supplied the Chiang Kai-shek bandits with a large amount of air force equipment and trained 5,137 Chiang Kai-shek air force personnel, including pilots, bombardiers, navigators, and technicians. As of now, 936 of these aircraft have been successively handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for use in the civil war (including 150 C-46 transport aircraft decided to be handed over last November); the delivery contracts for the other 135 aircraft are also being negotiated. It is claimed that the batch of aircraft (already transferred to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits) was originally worth US$121 million, but was sold for US$7.2 million. In addition, air force equipment, including parts, worth US$178 million is also awaiting shipment. The plan to train air force personnel was completed last December, at a cost of US$8.75 million. U.S. imperialism has obtained the right to supervise Chiang Kai-shek's air force through this "aid." The contract of November 20 last year stipulated that the U.S. could send personnel to China to manage various air force institutions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The U.S. State Department's publication of this letter is to prove that "U.S. military aid to China (Chiang) is much more than generally understood" (Marshall's words), and to answer the accusations of some U.S. congressmen that the State Department's military aid to Chiang Kai-shek is not active enough.

　　美援蒋空军计划暴露
    【新华社陕北一日电】据华盛顿消息：美空军部长苏雅特。薛明顿经由马歇尔于二十七日转交给美国会的一封信函，供认了美帝在“和平调解”烟幕下替蒋匪建立空军，鼓励蒋介石发动和继续屠杀中国人民的内战的一项秘密计划。该计划系于一九四六年七月蒋匪大规模发动内战时批准的美蒋秘密协定中所确立，名为“八又三分之一队空车”计划。依照该项计划，美国以一千零七十一架飞机，以“廉价售予”方式，为蒋匪编制起一个重轰炸机大队，一个中型轰炸机大队，四个单引擎战斗机大队，两个运输机大队，和一个摄影侦察机中队。美国并供给蒋匪以大量空军装备，和训练蒋匪五千一百三十七个包括飞行员、轰炸手、领航和技师的空军人员。截至现在，其中九百三十六架飞机已陆续交与蒋匪在内战中使用，（包括去年十一月间决定交与之一百五十架Ｃ四六运输机）；其他一百卅五架的交付合同亦正在商定中，据称：该批飞机（已移交蒋匪）原值一亿两千一百万美元，售价为七百廿万美元。此外，尚有价值一亿七千八百万美元的空军装备包括零件在内，亦正待启运中。训练空军人员的计划，则已于去年十二月完成，据称共费八百七十五万美元。美帝国主义通过此种“援助”取得了对于蒋匪空军的监督权，去年十一月廿日之合同即规定美帝可派遣人员来华管理蒋匪各种空军机构。美国务院之公布该信函，系用以证明“美国对华（蒋）军事援助较一般所了解的多的多）（马歇尔语），而借以回答美若干国会议员谓国务院军事援蒋不积极之责备。
