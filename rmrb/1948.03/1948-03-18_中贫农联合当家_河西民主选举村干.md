　　Middle and Poor Peasants Jointly Run the Household
　　Hexi Democratically Elects Village Cadres
    [Our News] After the establishment of the Farmers' Association in Hexi Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, the idea of re-electing village government committee members was brewing. Poor peasant groups and Farmers' Association groups successively studied and discussed what kind of cadres were needed, assigning personnel according to tasks. Based on the opinions of each group, only seven committee members were needed for village chief, wartime service, production cooperation, armed forces, civil affairs, and warehouse. The previous preferential treatment for resisting the Japanese and tilling on behalf of others could be managed concurrently by civil affairs. Only one armed forces committee member was selected (previously there were five armed forces cadres). The masses' opinion was that the village was small and too many cadres were not appropriate. Subsequently, poor peasant groups, Farmers' Association committees, and Farmers' Association groups held meetings successively to propose candidate lists. In order to allow everyone to propose the people they wanted to elect as much as possible, no restrictions were placed on the number of candidates. As a result, each group proposed a total of twenty-four people (thirteen poor peasants, eleven middle peasants).
    On February 27th, an election meeting was held. Except for those landlords who had been struggled against, all male and female voters in the village were present. The meeting was presided over by the chairman of the Farmers' Association. When the comrades of the work team spoke, they reiterated that village cadres were not officials, but long-term laborers, and particularly emphasized that everyone could freely choose the people they had in mind. Then, the candidates made campaign-style speeches. As a result of the election, Zhang Tangde, one of the five committee members of the poor peasant group, was elected as the village chief. He was an honest poor peasant who had spent his life selling peppercorns, working in brick kilns, and doing odd jobs, and only turned over last year. In addition, of the six committee members elected, four were poor peasants and two were middle peasants. Among them, two Party members were elected as formal committee members, and one was elected as an alternate committee member. After the meeting, the masses unanimously reflected that these elections were getting better each time, that this was truly implementing democracy, and that those elected were all upright and respectable people, almost what they had in mind. This was different from the previous designation and arrangement.
    In general, this election was relatively mature and satisfactory in terms of both election methods and election results because there was sufficient time for preparation and experience from the previous two elections (poor peasant group and Farmers' Association). For example, when proposing candidates, there was repeated deliberation. For example, when the Xianbao Group in Lower Street proposed candidates, some candidates were not agreed upon by the entire group, and those who disagreed retained their opinions. When the Linshan Group in Upper Street proposed Tangde as the village chief and Linshan as the cooperative committee member, they also discussed how to solve the difficulties of their family's labor force. This shows how much the masses hoped that the candidates they proposed would be elected. In short, throughout this election, the masses truly and responsibly, in the capacity of masters, determined what kind of cadres were needed and selected the people they had in mind, so the masses unanimously reflected that the election was good. From the election results, those elected were all diligent and upright, and none of those who simply opposed the old cadres for their own sake and were good at talking were elected.
    However, from the process of selecting village cadres this time, there are several issues that must be noted and grasped in leadership: First, throughout the entire election process, it is necessary to allow the masses to fully express their opinions at all times, and consciously raise the masses' awareness. When the leadership's intentions cannot be accepted by the masses, there should not be the slightest expression of forcing the masses to accept them, otherwise, the masses will feel that it is another top-down arrangement and command. Secondly, before the formal election, it is necessary to allow the masses to fully prepare and mature, and at the same time, persuasion and education must be carried out on some incorrect opinions. For example, when Hexi proposed candidates, some people suggested: "Whoever is elected will have a relative nearby and will be unfair. It is safer to choose single-family households or outsiders." In response to this opinion, explanations were made to the masses, stating that the main conditions should be to select people based on political awareness and good ideological qualities. People with bad ideas and low awareness, even if they are single-family households, are prone to being unfair. Later, the masses were allowed to discuss it, and this incorrect opinion was denied.

### 中贫农联合当家　河西民主选举村干

　　中贫农联合当家
  　河西民主选举村干
    【本报消息】武安九区河西村农会成立以后，即酝酿改选村政府委员问题。先后由贫农团小组、农会小组研究讨论要些什么干部，因事设人。根据各组意见，只要村长、战勤、生产合作、武装、民事、仓库等七个委员，过去的优抗代耕，可由民事兼管，武装干部只选一个武装委员（过去只武装干部就有五个），群众的意见是，因村小干部不宜过多。接着贫农团小组、农委会、农会小组先后开会，提候选人名单，为了使大家能尽量提出自己要选的人，人数上不加限制。结果各组共提了二十四人（十三个贫农，十一个中农）。
    二月二十七日，举行选举大会，除被斗户外，全村男女选民都到齐了，会议由农会主席主持，工作组同志讲话时再次说明村干部不是当官，是当长工，特别强调的指出大家可随意选自己心上的人。接着，候选人作竞选式的讲话。选举结果，贫农团五个委员之一的张堂的当选了村长，他是一辈子卖花椒、上砖窑、打短工，去年才翻过身来的老实贫农。此外当选的六个委员中，四个贫农两个中农，其中两个党员当选正式委员，一个当选候补委员。会后群众一致反映：这几次选举，一次比一次好，这才是真正实行民主，选的都是正派老气人，和自己心肝眼想的差不多。和过去指定包办的不同。
    总起来说，这次选举，因酝酿时间足够，同时又有了上两次（贫农团和农会）选举的经验，无论在选举方式上选举结果上，都是比较成熟圆满的。比如提候选人时，就再三的酝酿，如下街贤保小组提候选人时，有的候选人也不是全组都同意，不同意者保留他的意见。上街林山组，在提出堂的当村长、林山当合作社委员时，连他们家的劳力困难如何解决也都好好讨论，这说明了群众是如何希望自己提的候选人当选。总之，这次选举中，自始至终，群众真正负责任的以主人资格，确定了要些什么干部并选拔了自己心上的人，所以选举以后群众都一致的反映选得好。从选举的结果看，当选的都是勤劳正直的，那些单纯为了自己而反对旧干部能说会道的人，一个也未被选上。
    但从这次选村干过程中看，有几个问题在领导上必须注意掌握：首先就是在整个选举过程中，一定要时刻让群众充分的发表自己的意见，并有意识的提高群众的认识，当领导上的意图不能为群众所接受时，也不能有丝毫强制群众接受的表现，否则，会使群众感到又是从上而下的包办命令。其次在正式选举以前，一定要让群众充分的酝酿成熟，同时对一些不正确的意见，也必须进行说服教育，如河西在提候选人时，就有人提出：“选上谁也有个本家近，都会不公道，要选独门独户或外来户保险。”针对这一意见，在群众中进行解释，说明主要的条件应该从政治觉悟，思想品质好坏去选拔，思想不好觉悟不高的人，即便是独门独户，也容易不公道。以后又让群众做了讨论，这一不正确的意见才被否定。
