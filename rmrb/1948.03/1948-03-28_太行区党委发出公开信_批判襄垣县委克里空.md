　　Taihang District Party Committee Issues Open Letter
  　Criticizing the Keli Kong of the Xiangyuan County Party Committee
    [This Newspaper News] The Taihang Xinhua Daily published a news item on the 19th of last month entitled "Xiangyuan Office Examines Keli Kong." The Taihang District Party Committee, in response, issued an open letter to the Xiangyuan County Party Committee on the 20th of this month, strictly criticizing their formalism and bureaucratism in reporting work, pointing out that this was a problem of thought and style, not a technical problem. It also raised the issue of ideological and stylistic transformation after rectification to the entire district party. The process is roughly as follows: In mid-February, the Taihang Xinhua Daily received the Xiangyuan February 10th summary of the two-month (December, January) winter production review, and discovered several problems: 1. The Land Law Outline had already been promulgated during this period, but the entire text did not mention a single word about the impact of the Land Law on winter production and the dynamics of various classes; 2. The summary stated that a total of 118,000 men and women in the county could participate in winter production, and they collected 88,673,000 dan of manure, averaging more than 23.5 dan per person per day, a figure that is questionable. 3. The summary stated that men's production yielded a profit of over 200 million yuan, and another place mentioned that District One alone yielded a profit of 100 million yuan, while the other five districts accounted for only a little more than half of the total, which is a suspicious discrepancy. In order to prevent Keli Kong, the newspaper immediately sent a letter to the Xiangyuan Office to inquire, and the reply stated that: before the material was compiled, the office sent a form to each village, simply collecting some figures, and added explanations based on snippets of information from small newspapers; the reflection of the Land Law was not paid attention to at all; the error in the figures was due to a mistake when calculating the forms submitted by the villages with an abacus. The actual amount of manure collected in the county was only over 140,000 dan, which was mistakenly reported as over 88.8 million dan. The 100 million yuan for District One was originally a plan set at a cadre meeting, which also included women's spinning. Finally, it was said that the mistake was mainly due to carelessness, sloppiness, and impracticality. … After the news was published, the Taihang District Party Committee immediately issued an open letter criticizing the Xiangyuan County Party Committee, pointing out that the county party committee should be held responsible for the formation of this Keli Kong, and also pointed out that the office's reply and self-criticism were not thorough, merely saying "carelessness," "sloppiness, and impracticality." Such a technical review is far from sufficient, and this is a problem of thought and style. The root causes are: 1. the tradition of formalism, only satisfied with superficial brilliant figures, without studying the actual problems in the work. Only caring about completing "tasks" without paying attention to the work process; not studying experiences and lessons, the summary is just a running account. 2. Bureaucratism, lacking a serious and responsible spirit towards the cause of the masses, not concerned about the actual activities and problems of the masses. Finally, it was emphasized that if this bureaucratic and formalistic style is not thoroughly eliminated in the current party rectification and democratic filling movement, then the new style after rectification will still not appear, and even if there is no intention to fabricate, false reports will still not be eradicated.

### 太行区党委发出公开信　批判襄垣县委克里空

　　太行区党委发出公开信
  　批判襄垣县委克里空
    【本报消息】太行新华日报上月十九日刊载了“襄垣办公室检查克里空”消息，太行区党委特为此于本月二十日向襄垣县委发出公开信，严格批评他们报导工作中的形式主义与官僚主义，指出这是一个思想和作风的问题，不是一个技术问题；并向全区党提出注意整编后思想作风的改造问题。其经过略如下：二月中旬太行新华日报收到襄垣二月十号总结的两月（十二月、一月）冬季生产回顾，发现几个问题：一、这期间土地法大纲已公布，但全文中没有一字提到土地法下去后在冬产中的影响及各阶层动态；二、总结中说全县能参加冬产的男、女共十一万八千多人，光粪就拾了八千八百六十七万三千多担，平均每人每天拾二十三担半还多，这数字值得怀疑。三、总结中男人生产共获利二万万余元，又一处提到光一区就获利一万万元，其他五个区只占总数的一半多，这样悬殊值得怀疑。为了防止克里空，报馆当即给襄垣办公室去信查问，得到回答大意是：在材料整理前办公室给各村发了个表，单纯搜集了些数字，另又根据小报上的点滴材料加以说明；土地法下去后的反映根本没注意；数字的错误是当时按各村交的表用算盘打了一下打错了。本来全县拾粪只十四万余担，误为八千八百余万担。一区的一万万原是干部会上订的计划，其中还包括妇纺。最后说这错误主要是由于粗枝大叶、太马虎、不实际。……消息发表后，太行区党委即发一公开信批评襄垣县委，指出这一克里空的形成县委应负责任，又指出办公室的复信检讨是不深刻的，仅仅说是“粗枝大叶”、“太马虎、不实际”，这样技术的检讨是十分不够的，这是一个思想和作风问题。其根源：一、是由于形式主义的传统，只满足于表面的辉煌数字，不研究工作中的实际问题。只管完成“任务”，而不注意工作的过程；不研究经验教训，总结只是流水帐。二、是官僚主义，对群众事业缺乏严肃负责精神，不关切群众的实际活动与问题。最后又着重指出，在当前整党民主填补运动中，如不彻底肃清这种官僚主义与形式主义的作风，则整编后的新作风仍不能出现，虽无心作假，但假报告仍不能够根绝。
