    [Taiyue News] The Yangcheng militia and laborers who followed the Chen Xie army on the southern expedition for six months have returned victoriously. A commendation and celebration conference and a victory goods exhibition were held on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of last month. More than 5,000 people, including representatives from the masses and various organizations, attended. Comrade Zhang Jianmin, who led the southern expedition, reported on the course of the southern expedition. In July and August of last year, Yangcheng dispatched a total of more than 2,200 militia and laborers on the southern expedition. They traveled about 10,000 miles south of the Yellow River, passing through more than 50 counties, and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in eliminating more than 50,000 Chiang bandit troops, opening up vast liberated areas. During the Battle of Mianchi, the laborers braved the fierce artillery fire of the Chiang bandits to deliver ammunition to the front line. They participated in about 1,000 battles of various sizes, cooperated with the troops in guarding prisoners, guarding supplies, and caring for the sick and wounded. They also disguised themselves to carry out propaganda, mobilize the masses, mobilize carts and stretchers, and assist the troops, etc. A total of more than 6,900 households were mobilized, 127 Chiang Kai-shek rifles and 5 pistols were seized, and 43 democratic governments were established. This time, the entire county brought back seized items and victory items sent by the troops, including 582 rifles, 22 pistols, 25 light machine guns, 4 portable guns, 5 small cannons, and other weapons, as well as 36 mules and horses.
