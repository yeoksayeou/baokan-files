　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Moscow dispatch: On the occasion of the Soviet Army Day this year, Soviet Marshal Rokossovsky published an article in Red Star, recalling some of the characteristics of Stalin's strategic guidance in the anti-fascist war.

　　The deployment of the Battle of Stalingrad was drafted by Stalin and implemented under his direct command. We usually adhere to the concept that when breaking through the defense line, the direction of the attack should have primary and secondary distinctions. In this regard, Stalin provided a creative example of evaluating this standard concept. For example: when I was preparing for a certain battle, I planned to launch a main attack in one direction and a secondary attack in another direction. After listening to my explanations and arguments, Stalin pondered for a while and said, "We have sufficient strength to launch two attacks, so please launch two attacks, instead of dividing them into auxiliary and main ones." This instruction from the Supreme Commander ensured the complete success of this battle. It greatly educated me and helped me further in selecting the direction of the breakthrough in the battle and deploying troops on the battlefield.

　　Once, one night in November 1944, I went to answer the phone. I heard Stalin's calm voice, saying: "Comrade Rokossovsky: What do you think of appointing you as the commander of the Second Belorussian Front?" I must admit that at first I was a little hesitant, because I did not know why I would be sent to this aspect that seemed not very important to me. So I answered Stalin in the same way. The Supreme Commander said, "Why do you think this aspect is not very important? That's not right. We should remember how Shamsonov's army moved. If we do not defeat the Germans in the north, if we cannot completely defeat the German army in East Prussia, and if Konev's army is not successful, then the First Belorussian Front in the center cannot achieve anything." So I realized that a major offensive was being prepared, and the redeployment of troops was obviously necessary. So I assured the Supreme Commander that I would do my best to live up to his trust. Later, when I was already in charge of the Second Belorussian Front, I made a report to Stalin. When I received his order to prepare for the East Prussian campaign, and when I knew the strength designated to participate in the offensive operation, I once again realized that my opinion that the direction was "not very important" was completely wrong. The result of that decisive battle determined the later course of the entire war.

　　Stalin clearly defined a task for my front: the task of carrying out a deep strike on the entire line of Willenberg (Note: on the southern border of East Prussia), with the aim of crushing the enemy corps from Pultusk to Mława (Note: south of Willenberg) and separating the East Prussian corps from the mainland. When approving the plan for the East Prussian campaign of the Second Belorussian Front, Stalin asked us to advance quickly and decisively, so that the enemy's main force would not escape our attack. At the same time, the Supreme Commander gave us detailed instructions on organizing the close coordination of all arms of the service participating in the operation.

　　After our army occupied Allenstein (Note: the central part of southern East Prussia), Stalin called me and asked, "What are your next plans?" I replied, "To eliminate the surrounded enemy." Stalin asked again, "How much time will it take to complete? Will it take a lot of time?" I replied, "Of course, it will take some time." So Stalin suggested ensuring a reliable encirclement, but not engaging in a prolonged confrontation with the enemy's main force. Stalin said, "I will send Chernyakhovsky's troops to continue to eliminate the surrounded enemy, and you must prepare to cross the Vistula River, seize its bridgehead, and firmly hold it."

　　While the fierce battles in East Prussia were still going on, the Supreme Commander had already prepared a new offensive operation for us. As early as February 8, Stalin determined the task of the Second Belorussian Front as follows: launch an offensive in the direction of the Vistula River with the central and left-wing forces, in order to occupy a line of positions from the mouth of the Vistula River, via Dirschau, Preußisch Stargard, Rummelsburg, to Neustettin no later than February 20; and, finally, meet with the reinforcements that have come up, further expand the offensive and occupy Danzig, Konitz, and eliminate the enemy on the coastline to the Gulf of Danzig.

　　It must be emphasized that the tasks Stalin assigned to each front were always achievable, and he provided the necessary strength and means to carry them out.

　　The full characteristics of the role played by our great leader in organizing and directing the defeat of such a powerful enemy as Hitler's Germany cannot be explained in a few words. We, the commanders of the front lines, working under Stalin's direct guidance, personally experienced his infinite energy, his foresight, his great analytical ability, and his great genius - the genius of a leader and a strategist.

　　斯大林的战略远见
  　罗科索夫斯基回忆录
    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科讯：今年苏军节日，苏联元帅罗科索夫斯基在红星报上发表一文，回忆斯大林在反法西斯战争中战略指导上的某些特点。
    斯大林格勒战役的部署，是由斯大林所拟定，并且在他直接指挥下实施的。我们通常遵守这样的概念，即，进行突破防线的时候，其打击的方向应有主要与次要之分。在这方面，对这一标准概念的估价，斯大林提供了创造性的范例。例如：当我准备某一战役时，我曾计划在一个方向进行主攻，在另一个方向进行辅攻。静听了我的解释和论点之后，斯大林沉思了一会儿，便说：“我们有很充分的力量进行两个攻击，所以请进行两个攻击，而不要分为辅助的和主要的。”最高统帅的这一指示，保证了这次战役获得完全的成功，它大大教育了我，大大帮助了我在选择战役突破的方向上和在战场上展开军队上进了一步。
    有一次，在一九四四年十一月的一天晚上，我去接电话。我听到斯大林的安祥的声音，他说：“罗科索夫斯基同志：任命你为第二白俄罗斯前线总指挥，你以为怎样？”我必须承认：开始我是有些犹豫的；因为我不知道，为什么我会被派到这一个在我看来似乎不十分重要的方面去。于是我就照样回答了斯大林。最高统帅说：“为什么你认为这一方面不十分重要呢？这是不对的。应该记住沙姆逊诺夫的军队是如何运动的。如果我们不在北方打败德国人，如果不能把东普鲁士的德军彻底打垮，如果科涅夫的军队又不成功，那么，就是中央的第一白俄罗斯前线也不能有所作为。”于是我认识到，大攻势已在准备中，部队的重新调动显然是必要的。所以我向最高统帅保证，我将尽最大努力不辜负他的重托。后来，在我已负责第二白俄罗斯前线的时候，有一次我向斯大林作了一个报告。当我接到他的关于准备东普鲁士战役的命令时，当我知道指定参加攻势作战的兵力时，我再次认识到，我认为那个方向“不十分重要”的意见完全错了。那次决定性战役的结果，决定了整个战争后来的进程。
    斯大林极其明确地为我的前线规定了一个任务：在威廉堡（按：在东普鲁士南端边界上）全线进行纵深打击的任务，目的在于粉碎普尔查斯尼兹到木拉瓦（按：在威廉堡之南）敌军兵团，并且把东普鲁士兵团和内地隔离开来。在批准第二白俄罗斯前线的东普鲁士战役计划的时候，斯大林要求我们迅速而坚决地前进，不让敌人的主力在我们的打击下逃跑了。同时最高统帅给了我们一个关于组织参加作战的一切兵种密切合同动作的详密命令。
    在我军占领了阿棱斯坦（按：东普鲁士南部中心）之后，斯大林给我打了一个电话，问道：“你下一步的计划是什么？”我答：“消灭被包围的敌人。”斯大林又问：“需要多少时间完成？是否需要很多时间？”我回答“当然需要一些时间”。于是斯大林提出意见，确保可靠的包围，但不要与敌人主力作长期周旋。斯大林说：“我将派车尼雅科夫斯基的部队去继续完成消灭被包围的敌人，而你必须作横渡维斯杜拉河的准备。夺取其桥头堡垒，并坚决固守之。”
    当东普鲁士的猛烈战斗还在进行时，最高统帅就已经为我们准备了一个新的攻势作战。还在二月八日，斯大林就确定了第二白俄罗斯前线的任务如下：以中央和左翼的部队，在维斯杜拉河方向发动攻势，以便最迟在二月二十日以前占领从维斯杜拉河河口，经杜尔三、比伦特、鲁木斯堡，到纽斯特丁的一列阵地；而且，最后与增援上来的部队会师，进一步扩张攻势并占领但泽、琴尼亚，把敌人消灭在海岸线以至但泽湾一带。
    必须着重指出：斯大林给予各个前线上的任务经常都是办得到的，而且予以必要的力量与办法去执行。
    我们伟大的领袖在组织和指挥打败象希特勒德国这样强大的敌人上，所起的作用的全部特点，不是几句话可以说明的。我们，前线的指挥官们，在斯大林直接指导下工作，亲身体会到他的无穷精力，他的远见，他的伟大的分析能力，他的伟大天才——领袖与战略家的天才。
