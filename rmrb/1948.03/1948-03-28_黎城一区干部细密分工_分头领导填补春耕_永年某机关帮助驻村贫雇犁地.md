Licheng First District Cadres' Meticulous Division of Labor
　　Leading Spring Planting Separately
　　A Certain Organ in Yongnian Helps Poor and Hired Peasants in the Stationed Village to Plow

　　[Licheng News] The First District work team convened a meeting of all district cadres on the 14th of this month. In addition to a detailed study of the filling-in movement in the base villages, they also discussed the production movement in the entire district. Of the 34 main villages in the district, apart from the five base villages carrying out the filling-in movement, the central task of the remaining 29 villages is the production movement. Because spring arrives early this year, and the spring plowing season is approaching, it would be a mistake if the leadership does not take care of the production needs of the vast majority of the villagers. Most village cadres have serious "lying down" thoughts. For example, the cadres of Maicang Village started performing operas last winter and did not stop until February 2nd of this year. They even prepared to perform at the temple fair in the city in early March, and adopted a hands-off attitude towards the production of the masses. There are also many problems in the thinking of the masses in the village. In the heart-to-heart talk session of the mutual aid team, a middle peasant named Shouhai said, "In the past, every household in our village competed and scrambled for sheep manure in the winter. Last winter until this January, no one could find a household willing to take sheep, I didn't have the energy to accumulate manure last winter. I thought it was my turn for struggle. Now I understand the Land Law, but I don't even have a handful of manure. I scared myself, and suffered a loss!" Based on the current situation, it was decided to select seven relatively strong cadres to be specifically responsible for leading the production movement, and several methods were discussed.

　　1. Conduct in-depth and repeated propaganda of the Land Law Outline. Explain the policies towards all classes in detail, especially to the middle peasants, clarifying that filling-in is not about disrupting equal distribution. Explain to the well-off middle peasants that the surplus land is voluntarily taken out through consultations to help poor and hired peasants turn over, without touching their movable property. 2. Vigorously publicize and explain the Border Region Government's announcement of ensuring spring plowing, that whoever plants will reap. 3. Patiently persuade and educate village cadres to actively lead the masses in production, admit their mistakes to the masses, and temper and transform themselves in the production movement, which is the only way out. 4. On the existing basis, rectify mutual aid (not disrupting and reorganizing). Rely on poor and hired peasants to unite middle peasants, carry out mutual aid production movement on a voluntary basis, and pay attention to solving the production capital difficulties of poor and hired peasants in the movement, such as farm tools, fertilizers, and seeds. Quickly distribute the 2.4 million yuan loan from the bank and 800 catties of cotton and 2,000 catties of sesame cakes from the district cooperative, and be sure to combine solving ideological problems with practical problems to promote the spring plowing production movement. (Yisheng, Xinwen)

　　[Yongnian News] During the Party consolidation and democratic movement in Qilidian, it was learned that there was still a lot of barren land in the poor peasant class, and because they had no livestock, they did not plow last year. With Qingming approaching, their demand for plowing is very urgent. The Poor Peasants' League Committee, based on the opinions of the masses, discussed how to solve this problem. The original plan was to mobilize some of the middle peasants' livestock, giving each head of livestock four catties of rice (including fodder) per day, but those with labor or semi-labor could adopt the method of exchanging labor. The middle peasants did not express any objections on the surface, but in reality, they were unwilling. The middle peasants discussed their thoughts among themselves and all disagreed, because they could not do their own work and the rice given was too little. The leadership heard the reflection of the middle peasants and felt that it was not appropriate to make the middle peasants' livestock work without equal value. They discussed with the stationed organs to solve this difficulty. First, they counted the number of poor, elderly, weak, and dependents of martyrs who had no livestock. Then they found plows and yokes, and the organs dispatched manpower and livestock to help with a two-day blitz, opening up 16 mu of thatched land, digging out about 3,500 catties of thatch, hauling 25 carts, and plowing 1.5 qing of land. This solved the difficulties of most poor, elderly, weak, and dependents of martyrs who had no livestock. For example, XXX's mother said, "The troops plowed the land for me, and didn't even drink a sip of water. I have never seen such good soldiers in my life." (Work Team, Li Zhiping)

　　黎城一区干部细密分工
  　分头领导填补春耕
    永年某机关帮助驻村贫雇犁地
    【黎城消息】一区工作队于本月十四日召开全区干部会议，除详细研究了基点村填补运动外，又讨论了全区的生产运动，全区三十四个主村，除五个基点村进行填补运动外，还有二十九个村中心是生产运动。因今年春浅，春耕季节马上来到，广大群众要求生产，领导上如不照顾大部分村庄广大群众的生产要求，就会犯错误。大部分村干部存在着严重的“躺倒思想”，如麦仓村干部从去年冬天开始演戏，一直到今年二月二还未停止，并准备在城内三月初十赶会出演，对群众生产采取不管态度。该村群众思想上也存在着很多问题，在互助小组谈心思会中，中农瘦孩说：“俺村过去到冬天卧羊的户都是争的争抢的抢，卧不上，去年冬到今年正月，羊群找不上卧羊家，我去年冬天就没有心劲积粪土，我觉的轮着我啦，每天在等斗争，现在明白了土地法，可是连一把粪也没有，这是自己吓唬自己，可吃了亏啦！”根据目前情况，特决定抽出七个较强的干部专门负责领导生产运动、并讨论出几种办法。
    一、深入的反复宣传土地法大纲，要详细讲解对各阶层的政策，特别对中农要说清楚，填补不是打乱平分，对富裕中农说清，多余的一部分土地是商商议议的自愿拿出来帮助贫雇翻身，不动其浮财。二、要很好的宣传讲解边府安心春耕，谁种谁收的布告。三、要耐心说服教育村干部积极领导群众生产，向群众承认错误，并在生产运动中来锻炼改造自己，才是出路。四、要在现有的基础上整顿互助（不是打乱重组织），应依靠贫雇团结中农，在自愿的原则下，开展互助生产运动，并在运动中注意解决贫雇的生产资本困难，如农具、肥料、种籽。将银行贷给的二百四十万元贷款及区联社贷棉花八百斤、麻饼两千斤，迅速分配，一定要将解决思想问题和实际问题结合起来，推动春耕生产运动。（一生、新文）
    【永年消息】七里店在进行整党民主运动中，了解了贫农阶层还有不少白地，因没牲口去年就没有犁。清明快到，他们翻土要求很迫切，当有贫农团委员会根据群众的意见，讨论如何解决，原计划动员一部中农的牲口，使一天每头牲口四斤米（草料在内），但有劳力的或半劳力的可采取换工办法。中农表面上没什么意见，但实际不愿意，中农与中农谈论心事，都不同意，因自己活不能干，给的米少。领导上听到中农的反映，感到不等价使唤中农牲口有点不适当，当与驻村机关商讨解决这个困难，首先统计贫农老弱及抗属没畜力的地数，又找犁找耕绳套、机关抽出人力牲口帮助突击两天，共开茅草地十六亩，刨出茅草约三千五百多斤，拉了二十五车，犁地一顷零半亩。这样解决了大部贫苦老弱及抗属没畜力的困难。如×××娘说：“队伍给俺犁地，连点水都没喝，一辈子也没见过这样的好兵”。（工作团、李治平）
