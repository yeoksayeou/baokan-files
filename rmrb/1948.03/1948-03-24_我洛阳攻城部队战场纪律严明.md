Xinhua News Agency, Yushan'e Front, 22nd: The Political Department of the Front Headquarters issued a letter to all commanders and fighters of the participating units in the Luoyang Campaign on the 15th. It began by stating: "In this campaign, our siege troops and support troops fully demonstrated our army's heroic fighting spirit and resolute will to fight for the people and to realize land reform, and began to learn to use democracy in military affairs, to give play to the wisdom of the masses, and to carefully understand the situation and study methods in the art of command; especially in the implementation of urban policies and the observance of battlefield discipline, it was better than in any previous battle; from top to bottom, guaranteeing and supervising each other, not violating policies and discipline, and all units showed many exemplary cases; for example, many comrades in a certain unit, due to continuous rain, had broken shoes and were running barefoot on cobblestone roads, and no one took any of the military shoes abandoned by the enemy at the station; a certain unit, even though they could not eat due to the fighting, no one tried the boxes of biscuits they saw; many comrades refused to accept the watches and pens voluntarily handed over by the prisoners, and all the spoils were reported at any time, and the use of materials was approved first. Because of this correct action, the citizens of Luoyang praised our army as Chairman Mao's army that saves people from suffering, and made our army's political influence deeply imprinted in the hearts of the citizens of Luoyang." The letter concluded by pointing out: This victory tested the achievements of the People's Liberation Army's land reform study, and called on all participating units to summarize this experience well, continue to implement the three checks and three rectifications, and earnestly learn the two skills of fighting and working with the masses, and prepare to meet greater victories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yushan'e Front, 22nd: During the Luoyang liberation campaign, the masses in the new districts enthusiastically supported the front lines. More than 500 emancipated peasants in Yiyang spontaneously formed a combat support team, participating in the war with the army for the first time in an organized manner, and organized a guard platoon along the way to cover the evacuation of the wounded. Before a certain unit set off to attack Luoyang, the masses in the village learned that the troops were about to move out, and they brought out large oxen to pull carts, and set up wine shops and lit firecrackers in the streets to send them off. The unit specially ordered to march in step through the street to pay tribute to the masses, and the masses on both sides immediately responded with thunderous applause, and gathered to send the troops out of the village for more than half a mile. Two large carts in the village kept sending them for two days and wanted to send them again. The troops thanked them politely, unloaded the things, and filled the carts with cattle feed and food for the cart drivers to return home, and sent them off home. When a certain company of a certain battalion was crossing the Luoyang River in a certain place, when the soldiers had just taken off their shoes and socks to cross the first river, the masses on the opposite bank learned that they were the People's Liberation Army and waved their hands to stop them, and automatically rowed a boat to carry them over. Then they concentrated seventy or eighty people and hundreds of pieces of wood to build a pontoon bridge in two hours.

　　我洛阳攻城部队战场纪律严明
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十二日电】前线司令部政治部，十五日发表告洛阳战役各参战部队全体指战员书。首称：“这次战役中，我攻城部队，与打援部队充分表现了我军为人民为实现土地改革而战的英勇战斗精神和坚决顽强的战斗意志，并开始学会了在军事上运用民主，发挥群众智慧，细心了解情况研究办法的指战艺术；尤以执行城市政策，与遵守战场纪律，比过去任何一次战斗为好；从上到下，互相保证，互相监督，不违犯政策纪律，各个部队都表现出不少模范事例；如某部队许多同志因连日天雨，鞋子破烂，打着赤脚跑石子路，车站敌人遗弃的一些军鞋都没人去拿，某部虽因战斗顾不上吃饭，看到成箱的饼干也没人去尝；许多同志拒绝接受俘虏自动交出的表和钢笔，一切缴获随时上报，动用物资都先经批准。由于这种正确的行动，洛阳市民均盛赞我军为毛主席的救苦救难的军队，使我军政治影响深印在洛阳市民的心里。”书中最后指出：这次胜利考验了解放军土改学习的成绩，号召各参战部队很好的总结这次经验，继续贯彻三查三整，认真学习打仗和作群众工作的两套本领，准备迎接更大的胜利。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十二日电】解放洛阳战役中新区群众热烈支援前线。伊阳五百余翻身农民自动组成战勤队，首次有组织的随军参战，途中并组织警卫排，掩护伤员撤退。某部攻洛出发前，驻村群众得悉部队即将出动，纷纷牵出大牛套车，并在街头摆设酒点，燃放炮竹饯行，该部特下令正步通过大街向群众致敬，两侧群众立即响起如雷的掌声，并聚送部队出庄半里多路。该庄两辆大车一直送了两天还要再送，部队婉言称谢，卸下东西后，并在大车上放满了牛料和赶车的群众返家的食粮，送别他们返家。某营一连在某地抢渡洛河，在要过第一道河时，战士们刚把鞋袜脱下，对岸群众得悉是解放军便摆手制止，自动划过船来载送，接着又集中了七、八十人和数百条木料在两个钟头内搭起一座浮桥。
