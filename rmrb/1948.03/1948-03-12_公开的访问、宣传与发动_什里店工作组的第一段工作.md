　　Public Visits, Propaganda, and Mobilization
    -- The First Stage of the Shilidian Work Group’s Work
　　　　　Village-Wide Mass Meeting
    After the Shilidian work group visited the poor and hired peasants for a day, they quickly convened a village-wide mass meeting on the evening of the 28th. At the meeting, they made their purpose clear, explaining to the masses: "Our work group is here to help everyone implement the Land Law Outline." They explained their attitude towards each class, the masses, and Party members and cadres, expressing their determination to implement democracy, rectify the Party, and help the peasants achieve complete liberation. They also presented the preliminary investigation materials, focusing on the demands of the masses at the meeting to support the poor and hired peasants and dispel their concerns about becoming masters of their own destiny. At the same time, they proposed consolidating the middle peasants and criticized the idea of "distributing and dividing everything equally like shuffling mahjong tiles." The branch of the Communist Party in Shilidian was also publicly announced at the meeting, and the list of Party members was read out. The masses were mobilized to offer opinions to Party members to help them reflect and correct their mistakes (opinions would be offered later, not at this meeting). The work group stated that they would never protect Party members and cadres and would definitely respect the opinions of the masses in handling matters. It was announced that the current village cadres should do a good job during the period of mass review, only being allowed to help implement the Land Law and not being allowed to sabotage it, and that retaliation would never be permitted. However, when offering opinions, everyone should be practical and reasonable, and fighting was not allowed. It was also explained that spring plowing was about to begin, and people should not be anxious about production because of the need to fill the gaps. The Border Region Government stipulated that whoever plants before the Qingming Festival will harvest, and everyone can also think about whether there are better ways to do a good job of filling the gaps without delaying production. About eight or nine hundred people, both men and women, young and old, attended the meeting. Everyone was concerned about the implementation of the Land Law, so everyone who could attend did. The meeting was very quiet and solemn throughout, and the attention of the masses was very focused.

    After holding a village-wide mass meeting and conducting extensive propaganda, the work group comrades continued to conduct visits, propaganda, and mobilization work. The purpose was: 1. To find out the "ins and outs," find support, and find truly honest and reliable poor and hired peasants to understand the specific demands of the poor and hired peasant class. 2. To awaken the consciousness of the poor and hired peasant class and cultivate backbone elements. 3. To dispel the concerns of the masses, allow the masses to offer opinions on Party members and cadres, and initially promote democracy. 4. To enable poor and middle peasants to correctly understand the Land Law and know the method of implementation. 5. To understand the situation in many aspects at any time (land, livestock, sideline occupations, factions...), accumulate materials, and lay the foundation for the work of class division, Party rectification, and gap-filling.
    　　　　Individual Visits
    In order to deeply understand the poor and hired peasants, targeted individual visits are necessary. During individual visits, the intention was also stated directly. Initially, considering that the people to be visited would have concerns and it would be difficult to talk if there were too many people, the form of individual heart-to-heart talks was adopted. After roughly understanding him, he was asked to connect with the poor and hired peasants he considered reliable, talk together, or let him introduce reliable poor and hired peasants, and the work comrades would then conduct individual visits. A flexible form was adopted, and they were asked to expand their circle, so that all the poor households in this group or nearby groups would be found completely, and they were taught not to miss the poor. Generally, the connections were made very quickly, and some groups connected four or five people in a day. At the same time, attention was also paid to breaking some people's "mysterious" views, and from the beginning, attention was paid to asking them to rely on themselves, not always relying on the work members. They were made to realize that the Communist Party had come up with new methods that satisfied the people's minds, that the general trend had changed, and that the work members were not the same as in the past. This was more effective, and played a greater role in dispelling their concerns. The work comrades made it clear that they were from Zhao Village. The poor and hired peasants knew the general situation of the work in Zhao Village and knew that the poor and hired peasants there had really taken power, so it was easy for them to trust and approach the work members. However, because they had been oppressed for too long, they did not immediately believe everything completely. At first, they still dared not speak and had opinions on the village cadres. At this time, they were encouraged to complain, and they were not asked urgently what opinions they had on the cadres. The main thing was to meet these poor and hired peasants, get to know each other, and become familiar. Because the masses already knew that the work group was doing things for them, the work group comrades were not too particular about the past forms of approaching the masses (such as working for them, getting involved in too many things that had nothing to do with the work, etc.). The masses demanded to talk about the "topic" at once, and they did not go around in circles. Some individual masses asked him to handle an unimportant matter, and he was told that if democracy and filling the gaps were done well, that matter would be easy to solve. It is wrong for some comrades to accommodate individual or a few people and distract themselves and the masses' attention.
    　　　updateConfirming the translated text of "Public Visits, Propaganda, and Mobilization - The First Stage of the Shilidian Work Group"

Overall, the translation is excellent. It accurately conveys the meaning, tone, and historical context of the original Chinese text. The formatting is also correct. Here are a few minor suggestions for improvement:

*   **"Land Law Outline" vs. "Outline Land Law":** Both are acceptable, but "Outline Land Law" might read a bit more naturally in English. However, given the context, keeping "Land Law Outline" is perfectly fine as it may reflect the specific terminology used at the time.

*   **"Gaps" and "Filling the gaps":** The term "填补" is used to describe making up for losses or deficiencies, likely referring to land redistribution or addressing economic inequalities. While "gaps" works, consider alternatives like "deficiencies," "shortcomings," or even "inequalities," depending on the specific context. "Filling the gaps" could be "addressing the deficiencies," "rectifying the inequalities," or "making up for the losses."

*   **"Village cadres should do a good job during the period of mass review"**: Consider the term "mass appraisal" in place of "mass review."

*   **"Poor households" should be "impoverished households".**

*   **"Anti-air raid shelters"** replace 防空洞's English translation with this term.

**Revised excerpt incorporating the suggestions:**

The original translation is already excellent. The suggested revisions are relatively minor refinements to enhance clarity and naturalness in English.

### 公开的访问、宣传与发动——什里店工作组的第一段工作

　　公开的访问、宣传与发动
    ——什里店工作组的第一段工作
  　　　　　全村群众大会
    什里店工作组到村访了一天贫雇后，就尽快于廿八日晚召开了全村群众大会。在大会上把牌子亮开，向群众说明：“我们工作组是来帮助大家实行土地法大纲的。”说明了对各阶层、对群众及党员干部的态度，表明实行民主、整党和帮助农民彻底翻身的决心，并把初步调查到的材料，集中群众的要求在大会上提出，给贫雇撑腰，打破对当家作主的顾虑；同时提出巩固的联合中农，批评了“象打麻将牌一样打乱平分”的说法。并在大会上公开了什里店党的支部，宣读了党员名单。动员群众向党员提意见帮助他们反省改错（意见以后提，这次会上暂不提）；表明工作组决不包庇党员干部，一定尊重群众的意见处理。宣布现任村干部要在群众审查期间好好办事，只许帮助实行土地法，不许破坏，而且永远不准报复。但大家提意见时也要讲实际说道理，不许打架。还说明：春耕马上就要开始，不要因为要填补就不安心生产，边府规定清明节前谁种下谁收，大家也可以想想有没有更好的办法能搞好填补又不误生产。到会群众男女老少共约八、九百人，大家都关心着实行土地法的事，所以能到会的都到了；会场一直很静肃；群众注意力很集中。
    开了全村群众大会，进行大宣传后，工作组同志继续进行访问、宣传及发动工作。目的是：一、摸“窟窿”，找依靠，要找到真正老实可靠的贫雇，了解贫雇层的具体要求。二、启发贫雇阶级自觉，培养骨干。三、打破群众顾虑，让群众对党员干部提意见，初步发扬民主。四、使贫农、中农能正确了解土地法，知道实行的方法。五、随时了解多方面情况（土地、牲口、副业、宗派………），积蓄材料，为划阶级、整党、填补等工作打基础。
    　　　　个别访问
    为了深入了解贫雇，有重点的个别访问是必要的。在个别访问时，也是直截了当的说明来意。最初，顾及要访问的人会有顾虑，人多了不好说话，采个别谈心的形式。大略了解了他之后，就要他去串连他认为可靠的贫雇，找在一起谈，或让他介绍可靠的贫雇，工作同志再去作个别访问。采取不固定的形式，并且要他们扩大圈子，要把本组或附近组的窟窿户完全找到，教他们不要漏了穷人。一般的串连得都很快，有些组一天就串连了四、五个人。同时，也注意了打破有些人的“神秘”观点，从最初就注意要他们依靠大家自己，不要老是依靠工作员。使他们认识到是共产党照老百姓的心思兴了新办法，是大势变了，不只是工作员跟过去的不同了。这样收效就更快，对于打破他们的顾虑起的作用也较大。工作同志说明白是从赵庄来的，贫雇知道赵庄工作的大概，知道那里贫雇真的已当了权，所以对工作员很容易信任，容易接近。不过，因为受压迫太久，他们也不是立即就完全相信。最初他们还是不敢说，对村干部有意见，这时就启发他们诉苦，也不急急问他对干部有啥意见。主要是和这些贫雇见见面，互相认识认识，熟识起来。因为群众已知道工作组是为他们办事的，工作组同志也就不太拘泥于过去接近群众的形式（如替他们劳动、过多的圪扯与工作无关的事等）；群众要求一下子就谈到“本题”上，就不去绕圈子说话。有个别群众要求给他处理一件无关重要的事，就告诉他把民主、填补作好了那事容易解决。有的同志迁就个别或少数群众而分散自己和群众的注意力，是不对的。
    　　　　普遍访问
    在七、八组工作的同志为了不遗漏一个贫雇并了解全组的情况，就进行了挨户访问。两组共五十五户，从开过全村群众大会后的一天起，费了三天工夫，大体访遍。每到一家，就向被访问的老乡表明：“我是工作团的”；他们大都已知道工作团来到什里店的消息，也大多知道了工作团是干啥的，这样一说他们也就知道来意了。一方面对前晚群众大会作些补充宣传，同时谈些家常，了解各家情况。
    在这两组挨户访问后，又发现了十二家贫雇。同时，也使群众对工作同志熟识起来，当面攀谈了一次之后，有意见有心事就比较容易找工作同志谈了。中农也可以因此不会再觉得“工作员背着咱们不知道搞啥事？”工作同志同时也在和许多人谈话中从侧面了解原先找到的几个贫农确是老实可靠的，以后就放心依靠他们了。
    经过挨户访问，也了解了各组的概况。重点是放在贫雇身上，附带也了解了别的一些问题。（如：发现了过去曾“上了等级”的斗争对象，不但有中农，甚至还有乡村工人和贫农，原因是查三代和乱按“恶霸”帽子等。）
    二组工作同志也进行了挨户访问。情形和七、八组进行的差不多，不过方式上有时是把一个院子有几家的找到一起谈，有时到这一家时就顺便探问一下别家的情形，看所谈的有无出入。有的人在地里刨粪，在场里铡草，就找到地里场里去和他们圪扯。除发现过去没找到的几家贫农以外，顺便也了解了一些被斗户情形、抗属翻身较高的情形，有些人有意见而未主动找工作组谈的，在工作同志访问他时谈出了。工作同志并特别留心了中农的情绪，向他再解释我们的政策，鼓励他们赶快送粪。
    　　　　贫雇农小型会
    二十九日上午，第一组工作员找了已串连的十四个贫雇开了一个小会，主要是启发他们的思想自觉；同时，团聚了这么多人，使他们感觉到力量已经不孤了，胆子可以壮起来。由积极分子把人找齐之后，工作员首先就问他们：“咱现在是干啥哩？”很多人齐声回答说：“搞‘法大纲’＠！”接着问他们：“为啥找你们这伙伙人？”王楼方说：“是要穷人当家，不能花言巧语，要老实农民。因为咱这些人要给地主当过牛马。”王文盛说：“过去评议员说照就照，不照就不照；俺们受过这痛苦，俺再办就公道。”王桂方说：“因为咱还缺房缺家具。以前斗地主的庄子、地、东西不分给穷人，要拿钱买。有钱的才能种好地住好庄子。”傅位的说：“没有给我分过一双筷子，支差啥都有咱。”王义说：“咱想买个缸，借了钱去买，人家（干部）也不卖给。人家就啥也能买，外边有钱，里边有人；外头里头都有人家人。”………工作员就向他们说：“这以后就要咱穷人说话掌权了，咱商量商量，咱的窟窿怎样填？从那里起土？”王文盛说：“地主还斗的不彻底，防空洞还有；中农咱不能动人家，动了中农谁还过得有劲呢？”很多人也嚷着说：“地主就是没斗透，房都没动，光念诵了念诵，地亩换了换！………”王全时说：“干部翻得过高，应该拿出来。库里存的果实也拿出来。”王玉锁说：“换点好地就算翻了身，咱也不能比人高了，要公道。”大家都说：“这样也就够了！”“再不够的时候再和上中农商量商量，他要愿意，也拿出来一点。”
    工作员再问：“咱要办到这样有啥作难？土有了，谁敢去担？”王文盛说：“敢干！不过要有权。”王兴昌说：“咱就破上了！”王文盛又说：“有人作主就行，拼命也得拼！”这情绪中仍含着很大害怕的成分，很多人还是表示害怕。王楼方说：“你们在，不怕。你们走了还是害怕。”这时，工作员就又解释了怎样组织贫农团、农会，说明工作组一定要到贫农和所有老实农民掌权了之后才走。一定要实行民主，成立农会后就要改选。给他们说：“坏干部不改好，咱就不要他，有好的才再选他，选上咱愿意选的好人，不怕报复。咱们贫农先要团结起来，还要团结中农。这样咱力量还不大？还怕什么？咱现在要紧的就是团结；大家回去后再好好思想思想还有没有没翻好身的穷弟兄，把他们都找来，不要漏了一户穷人。还要好好给中农解释，咱不斗中农；咱都宣传宣传，叫大家都赶快送粪，不然将来还是各自吃亏。”
    从这会上，我们调查到了贫雇的要求，一些干部的情况，填补的来源，也从这中间了解到了那些是比较老实可靠的贫雇，那些不是真正的贫雇和有宗派及报复情绪的。同时也就进行了宣传与发动。其他组织也开了这种小型会。
    　　　　各组贫雇联合谈心
    一天晚上，一位工作同志把三、四、五、六组的贫雇找到一起，开了一个谈心会，到会二十六人。目的是进一步发动他们，让他们互相知道有这么些人在一块儿了，提高信心；同时也为了使他们互相鉴别。
    首先启发他们从困难谈起。李发同说：“我住那房子，连倒尿的地方都没有，还是住人家的，受人家刻薄。”接着很多人都三言两语谈了自己的苦处，表示不满，转入给干部提意见。这时候一个人出去撒尿回来，悄悄地说：“我看见有个影，恐怕有人在听咱吧？”又有两人出去看了看，回来说：“没有”，大家才松了一口气。工作同志看到他们仍然有害怕情绪，就插了几句话，说明我们贫雇以后要怎样组织起来，怎样当家，说明以后权掌在咱们手里，还怕啥？有干部听就让他们听也没啥，有意见以后还要当他的面提哩！
    开过这个会后，有的贫雇反映找来开会的这些人中有四家给地主当过防空洞，要工作同志注意。三、四组贫雇较少，势孤，去开这个会以后，情绪高了。
    和三、四、五、六组贫农谈心会同时，三、四组和五、六组中农也分两下开了谈心会。开会之前，事先由可靠的贫雇说出几个最能代表中农思想又能宣传的人，由这些人再去找一些中农来（不是全体中农，各组总共到了有四十户左右。）说明对中农态度，了解情况，安定他们的情绪。
    以上这些方式灵活运用，依照工作的需要和群众生产情况随时采取各种不同方式，其中以访贫雇、开小型会及群众大会为主要方式，以白天进行访问及小型会、晚上开较大的会为原则，以免耽误送粪、垒堰。（有必要时耽误一半天时间，农民也是愿意的，因为这是为了他们自己的长远利益）
    　　　　总结
    用完全公开的方式进行工作，一开始就和全村群众见面，和多数贫雇接触，未受少数人的包围。这样做，中农的动荡也较少。开群众大会后，地里人立即多了起来，送粪、刨堰的都多了。坏党员干部也不易钻空子破坏，群众胆就大了。开群众大会前一天访贫雇时他们还不敢说话，第二天再和贫雇谈，他们就比过去敢提一些意见了。同时，不是单纯访问（搜集材料）、单纯宣传（讲教条），而和民主运动、划阶级教育相结合，行动目标是较明确的。
    这一段工作中也有不少缺点：一、找了一些贫雇后，把他们热劲提起来了，后来却又凉在那里；想着找到了可靠的人，我心里有数了，就搁在那里，没有用适当的名义（如“窟窿户小组”等）把他们组织起来，他们没有名义进行活动，不能主动，不能形成核心，所以不能很好的发挥力量，虽然党员干部集中反省了，仍感受非党干部的压力。（如第一互助组长竟威吓一个贫雇说：“工作团一来，看你这几天就脚不站地了呵！”这个贫雇就不积极了。）访贫雇阶段不可拖得太长，贫雇也不是短时期内可能完全了解，要在运动中考验他们。从初到村到划阶级前一天，共有六、七天时间。其实有五天也就够了。拖长的结果，反而发生了毛病，因为没有组织、没有共同的行动，个别组贫雇内部曾闹不团结。二、个别组访问不深入，普遍接近，跑马式的；或初一访就认为“照”了，过于性急，把工作看得过于简单、容易。三、有的组则又过于多疑，不敢依靠。看看这个，嫌他顾虑太多太不积极；看看那个，嫌他太积极，怕有领袖欲望；看到还敢说话的，怕他不“老实”；看家里打扫得干净些，觉得不象劳动人家；找几个骨干，又怕他们脱离群众，甚至害怕自己找骨干也会脱离群众。其实，贫雇也难免有缺点的，主要看对缺点采取什么态度，应该大胆依靠而耐心教育。
