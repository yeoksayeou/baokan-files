Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to Tianjin newspapers: Beijing opera performers at the "Drama Festival" on the 15th of last month bitterly recounted the harshness and tyranny inflicted on the drama community by the Chiang bandits. At the festival's commemorative meeting, renowned director Ma Yanxiang stated that under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, opera performers "are insulted and harmed," and they have "many tears and sorrows." Mr. Ma compared Chiang Kai-shek's rule with that of the Northern Warlords, saying: Twenty years ago, there was no entertainment tax, but last year it was forcibly levied at 25 percent, and this year it has been increased to 30 percent; furthermore, they are extorting "city defense fees," "winter relief donations," and "comfort fees" for the Chiang troops, with harsh taxes and levies accounting for 50 to 60 percent of ticket revenue. In addition, there are "obligatory" performances and "troop慰劳" performances, with each performance requiring 84 seats to be reserved for the Chiang authorities. The Hua Le Theater was designated to reserve five boxes; the San Qing Theater, three boxes; and the Chang'an Theater, one box. This year's Spring Festival also saw the specification of "Seventeen Articles of Control Measures." The chairman of the conference, Jiao Juyin, said in his speech that the heavy taxes have reduced the number of viewers; and with rising prices, even if every performance is fully seated, they will still lose money.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: The Chiang bandit-occupied areas of Chahar Province had huge financial expenditures last year, and harsh taxes and levies were rampant. The total provincial and county-level annual expenditure budget amounted to more than 56.5 billion Chiang currency, while the annual revenue budget was only more than 3.2 billion Chiang currency, less than 5.5 percent of the expenditure. The Chiang bandit central government only subsidized the province with more than 13 billion Chiang currency, leaving a total shortfall of more than 40.3 billion Chiang currency. The bandit chief Fu Zuoyi plundered the people extensively. The provincial deficit was accompanied by the collection of 128,000 dan of "provincial public grain" along with the land tax; and a so-called "Measures for Counties to Donate Public Grain" was formulated, ordering each county to double the amount of grain requisitioned in kind, i.e., 160,000 dan, as county-level income. These two items, together with the requisitioned grain, amounted to 448,000 municipal dan. In addition, "Tax Collection Offices" were established in various counties to forcibly collect "various 'autonomous' taxes and special taxes"; in Zhangjiakou, the "Special Tax on Raw Hides and Furs" and "Brokerage '义' Donations" were forcibly collected. Last year, the Chiang bandit central government issued winter clothing expenses for Fu bandit's security teams, only 60,000 Chiang currency per set. Based on last winter's Zhangyuan prices, this was only equivalent to the price of four or five catties of flour. Fu bandit then ordered the "Tax Collection Office" to forcibly collect sheepskins from the people in various counties. The Fu bandit's Finance Department has recently stipulated the imposition of numerous harsh taxes and levies. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas of Chahar Province cannot bear the harshness and tyranny, and incidents of peasants in PingSui County and Shang Huai Lai County robbing grain in groups of three or five have occurred everywhere.

　　蒋匪苛杂捐税繁多
  　北平剧人叫苦连天
    【新华社陕北三日电】据天津报纸消息：北平剧人于上月十五日“戏剧节”痛述蒋匪所加于戏剧界之苛暴。该节日纪念会上，名导演马彦祥表示在蒋介石统治下的剧人“是被侮辱与被损害”的，他们有“很多泪水与辛酸”。马氏把蒋介石的统治与北洋军阀的统治对照说：二十年前没有娱乐捐，去年却被强征百分之二十五，今年又加到百分之三十；而且还勒收“城防费”、“冬赈救济捐”、蒋军“慰劳费”，苛杂占门票收入百分之五十到六十。此外还有“义务”戏和“劳军”戏，每场要留给蒋当局八十四个位子，华乐戏院被指定留五个包厢；三庆戏院留三个包厢；长安戏院留一个包厢，本年春节还特定了“管制办法十七条”。大会主席蕉菊隐在致词中说：捐税太重使观众减少；且物价高涨，即使场场满座也要赔本。
    【新华社陕北三日电】据蒋区报纸透露：察哈尔省蒋匪侵占区去年财政支出庞大，苛杂繁兴。其省级与县市岁出总预算共达蒋币五百六十五亿余元，岁入预算仅三十二亿余元，不到岁出百分之五点五。蒋匪中央只补助省级一百三十余亿元，共不敷四百零三亿余元。匪首傅作义同人民大肆搜刮，其省级赤字随同田赋带征“省公粮”十二万八千担；并制定所谓“各县公粮捐助办法”，令各县按照征实征借数额加征一倍，即十六万担，作县级收入。此两项连同征实征借即达四十四万八千市担。此外在各县设立“捐税稽征处”，强征“各项‘自治’税捐及特别课税”；在张家口强征“生皮毛特税”及“牙纪‘义’捐”；去年蒋匪中央发给傅匪的保安团队冬衣费，每套仅蒋币六万元，按去冬张垣物价计算，只合四、五斤面粉的价钱，傅匪又命“稽征处”在各县强征民间羊皮，傅匪财政厅近又规定开征苛杂多种，察省蒋区人民不堪苛暴，起而反抗者日多，平绥县上怀来县农民三五成群抢夺粮食之事已到处发生。
