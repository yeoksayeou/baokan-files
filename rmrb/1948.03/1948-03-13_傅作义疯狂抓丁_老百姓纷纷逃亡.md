Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 7th: The bandit Fu Zuoyi has recently been frantically seizing recruits in Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces, clamoring to seize 400,000 men. It is reported that Suiyuan province is expected to seize 10,000 recruits; the provincial capital, Gui Sui city, is scheduled to seize 800. Along the Ping-Sui Railway in places such as Chaigoubu, and in Sui Dong like Xinghe, and in northern Shanxi like Yanggao, Jiang and Fu's bandit troops have set out from their strongholds to seize recruits everywhere. The Fu bandits even stop people on the roads to capture them on the main roads between Datong and Zuoyun. In Yungang Town and Jiangjiawan, Datong County, on the second day of the Lunar New Year at midnight, Fu bandit troops suddenly surrounded the villages and captured twenty-nine people from more than twenty households; in Xinnan Village, Zuoyun, about fifty households also had more than forty people seized. In Huailai County, in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, the Fu bandits surround villages day and night, arresting anyone they see. Even elderly people and young children who are captured are subjected to blackmail by the bandits, who demand one million yuan in Chiang currency for each person to be redeemed. The compatriots under the Fu bandit's ravages are now facing this great disaster and fleeing in droves. In Huazhuang Village, Huailai County, Shanxi, more than 100 of the 190 households have fled to escape, and many have come to the liberated areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 11th: After Fu bandit's backbone 32nd Division suffered a devastating blow on the Ping-Han northern line, the morale of the bandit troops has further declined. Officers and soldiers of the 4th Replenishment Training Division, cowering in Youyu City, Yanbei, are discussing: "The main force is finished, can we still hold on?" During the Spring Festival alone, more than a hundred people deserted. Earlier this month, more than a hundred Fu bandits escorting ammunition from Guisui to Zhangjiakou deserted almost entirely en route. The Third Company of the Field Artillery Battalion of the Temporary Tenth Division has also recently seen fifty people desert. In the bandit Independent Security Cavalry Regiment of Qingshuihe in southern Suiyuan, with a total of over a hundred men, a quarter of the personnel take sick leave as soon as they hear of fighting, causing the puppet county magistrate, Su Xinghan, to lament "the situation is critical and the building is about to collapse." After Chiang bandit soldiers learned that land reform has been implemented in the liberated areas, they have been rushing back to their hometowns in the liberated areas. Zhang Huguo, a first-class soldier of the Second Company, Third Battalion, Second Regiment of the Fourth Replenishment Training Division in Youyu City, defected to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the seventh day of the Lunar New Year. He was introduced back to his native Daixian to reunite with his mother and was allocated land. Hou, a soldier of a certain unit of the Qingshuihe bandit army, also accompanied his father, carrying weapons, to join the liberated area, and has also been allocated land to settle down and produce.
