　　Communications and Correspondence
  　No. 18
    I. Xiajin and Guangzong County Offices of Jinnan, and to the comrades of the work teams: We have received the mimeographed circulars you sent, and have excerpted from them. Please write and send us updates on your work progress, problems discovered, and lessons learned at any time.
    II. To the Communications Group of the Heshun Chengguan Work Team: We have received your ten-day summary. We can see that you have achieved results, but the material is not sufficient. We hope that you will provide detailed reports on separate topics such as party rectification, poverty investigation, employment, and the establishment of peasant associations, as soon as possible.
