Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- Reports from various sources: Just as the Italian election struggle is extremely fierce, the United States, Britain, and France suddenly jointly sent a note to the Soviet Union and Italy on the 20th, using the excuse that "the Security Council has not reached an agreement on the dispute over the position of Governor of the Free Port of Trieste," and played the trick of handing the port over to Italy. This conspiracy has aroused the anger and protest of the world's democratic people, and they have exposed it one after another. The French Communist newspaper L'Humanité denounced: "Bidault, on the orders of the US State Department, came out to act as a defender of chauvinistic sentiments, proposing to hand over the port of Trieste to Italy, in order to oppose the Italian democrats who favored a fair and peaceful settlement of the port issue." The Czech government accused the US imperialists of trying to "preserve this military base on the Italian border," and exposed the US imperialists' excuse as being that the US imperialists themselves were obstructing the process, "inciting the Italian government to sabotage the appointment of the Governor of the port." The Italian working people also rose up to expose the wolf's nature hidden in the US imperialists' sheepskin. Italian Communist leader Togliatti issued a statement in Sicily stating: "This step is not only a pre-election adventure, but also a barbaric attempt to play with the feelings of the Italian people and drag Italy into an atmosphere of war." L'Unità pointed out that this conspiracy is related to the scheme to drag Italy into the Western European group, and the newspaper loudly called out: "The Italian people, who are striving to establish friendly relations with the new democratic countries, cannot accept this proposal." The newspaper emphasized: "The port of Trieste has become a US-British colonial base, and we will never allow the fate of the port of Trieste to be used to carry out sinister conspiracies, create chaos in the election campaign, and involve Italy in the provocations of the warmongers." Avanti! incisively said: The Trieste proposal is part of a plan by the so-called "Western democratic countries" to exert political pressure on the Italian people. Yesterday, Marshall threatened us with hunger, but today he allows us Trieste. What they allow us is what they cannot give. At best, this proposal is just a campaign promise, and at worst, their purpose is to provoke Yugoslavia.

(Note: The port of Trieste originally belonged to Yugoslav territory. After the First World War, it was forcibly seized by Italy. After the Second World War, it was occupied by the troops of the United States, Britain, and Yugoslavia. At the Paris Peace Conference, the Soviet Union advocated satisfying Yugoslavia's demands and returning the port of Trieste to Yugoslavia, but the United States and Britain attempted to turn it into a base for invading the Balkans, refused Yugoslavia's demands, and finally agreed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in the autumn of 1946 to designate the port of Trieste and its vicinity as a free zone, establish a governor, to be appointed by the Security Council. Within four months after the governor takes office, a constitutional assembly shall be established by popular election. The troops stationed by Britain, the United States and Yugoslavia shall withdraw after the governor considers that local security can be maintained. However, this agreement was again undermined by the United States and Britain, and the governor has not yet been selected.)

　　美英法利用的港玩弄意人民
    竟图扰乱意大利选举
    各国民主人民表示愤怒抗议
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】各方讯：正当意大利选举斗争非常激烈的时候，美英法忽然在二十日联合致苏、意照会一件，借口“安理会对的里雅斯特自由港总督职位之争执未获协议”，而玩弄将的港交给意大利的花样。这一阴谋已引起世界民主人民的愤怒抗议，并纷纷加以揭穿。法共人道报指斥：“比道尔奉美国务院的命令，出来充当沙文主义情感的卫士，提议将的港交给意大利，以反对赞成的港公正而和平解决的意国民主人士。”捷克政府指责美帝此举是“想在意边境保守这一军事基地”，并揭露美帝的借口，是美帝自己在内作梗，“怂恿意政府从中破坏任命的港总督。”意大利劳动人民也急起戳穿美帝的羊皮外衣中所隐藏的狼的本色。意共领袖托格里亚蒂在西西里岛发表声明称：“这一步骤不仅是选举前的冒险，而且也是玩弄意人感情，把意大利拖到战争氛围中去的野蛮企图”。团结报指出这一阴谋与将意大利拖入西欧集团的鬼计有关，该报大声疾呼：“力图与新民主主义国家建立友好邦交的意国人民，不能接受这一建议。”该报强调：“的港已变成美英殖民基地，我们决不容许的港命运被用来进行罪恶的阴谋，在选举运动中制造混乱，和把意大利卷入战争贩子们的挑衅行为中去。”前进报一针见血的说：的港建议是所谓“西方民主国家”对意人民施以政治压力计划中的一部分。马歇尔昨天用饥饿来威胁我们，而今天他却允许给我们的里雅斯特。他们允许给我们的，是他们所不能给的。最多，这个建议只是竞选时期的诺言，而最糟的是他们的目的在向南斯拉夫挑衅。
    （按的港原属南国领土，第一次大战后为意国所强割，二次战后，为美英南三国军队所分占。巴黎和会上苏联会主张满足南国要求，将的港归还南国，美英则图将其变为入侵巴尔干的基地，拒绝南国要求，最后于一九四六年秋外长会议上协议，将的港及其附近划为自由区，设一总督，由安理会委派，总督就任后四个月内，由人民选举设立宪议会。英美南驻军由总督认为当地治安可以维持时，然后撤退。但此项协议又遭到美英之破坏，总督迄未选出。）
