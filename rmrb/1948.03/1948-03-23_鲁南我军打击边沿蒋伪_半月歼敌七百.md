    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st: A unit of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the Lunan local armed forces, is striking at the edges of Chiang's puppet regime. In the past half-month, they have killed and captured more than 750 local bandits. In late last month, one of our units once crossed the Jinpu Railway to the west and advanced into the area east of Weishan Lake, destroying most of the local puppet organizations. Another unit captured the enemy stronghold of Xiyandian, between Qufu and Sishui, on the 28th, defeating the puppet organizations in more than ten nearby villages. On the 29th, a unit swept through the area west of Tancheng, successively capturing four Chiang bandit strongholds such as Jiangshang and Beinian. On the 3rd of this month, the local armed forces of Zhao@ (newly established county, formerly northern Pixian), Pixian annihilated most of the enemy Lanling District Squadron in the Liujing area. Wherever our troops went, they actively protected the masses' spring plowing and opened granaries to relieve the poor. A large number of poor people, who had been cruelly exploited and plunged into starvation by the Chiang bandits, came from dozens of miles away to receive grain. After capturing Xiyandian, our troops distributed over 60,000 jin of grain from the local despots and landlords in twelve villages, such as Pengjiayu, to more than 300 households of hungry people.

    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st: In the battle to capture Zhangdian City on the Jiaoji Railway, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, as the main attacking force and the garrison force stationed in Zhangdian, concentrated, inventoried, and handed over to the public all the spoils of war, regardless of size or value, within three days after the battle. When they first entered the city, uniforms, shoes, and other items were abandoned everywhere in the enemy's camp, but not a single soldier, who was soaked in mud from fighting in the rain and marching barefoot, took anything. A scout was allowed to temporarily use a towel abandoned by the Chiang bandits as a marker due to urgent needs, and it was returned as is after use. The residents and merchants of the city praised the regiment for its strict discipline, not taking a single needle or thread from the people, its amiable attitude, and its simple lifestyle. The regiment has been commended by its superiors for this.

    鲁南我军打击边沿蒋伪
  　半月歼敌七百
    【新华社华东二十一日电】解放军一部配合鲁南地方武装，打击边缘蒋伪。半月来共毙俘土顽七百五十余名。上月下旬，我某部一度西越津浦路，挺进微山湖以东地区，摧毁当地大部伪组织。另部于二十八日攻克曲阜、泗水间敌据点西盐店，打垮附近十余村伪组织。二十九日某部横扫郯城以西地区，连克蒋上、北埝等四蒋匪据点。本月三日，赵＠（新设县原邳县北部），邳县地方武装在刘井一带，歼灭敌兰陵区中队大部。我军所至，积极掩护群众春耕，并开仓济贫，被蒋匪残酷压榨陷于饥饿的大批贫民，从数十里远道赶来领粮。攻克西盐店后，我军即将彭家峪等十二个村恶霸地主的六万余斤粮食，分给三百余户饥民。
    【新华社华东前线二十一日电】解放军某团在此次攻取胶济线张店市战斗中，为主攻部队及进驻张店之卫戍部队，全体指战员在战后三天内，即将所有胜利品不论大小贵贱全部集中清点交公。当他们刚进入市区时，匪军营地到处遗弃着被服、鞋子等物品，但冒雨作战满身泥水，赤脚进军的战士们没有一人拿用任何东西。侦察员因紧急需要，获准临时使用蒋匪遗弃之毛巾作标记，用毕也如数交还。全市居民及商家，均盛赞该团纪律严明、秋毫无犯、态度和蔼、生活朴素。该团为此已荣获上级传令嘉奖。
