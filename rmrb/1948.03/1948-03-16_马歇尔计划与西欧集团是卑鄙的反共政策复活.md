　　Marshall Plan and the Western European Bloc are a Revival of Despicable Anti-Communist Policies

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] Moscow Dispatch: Marinin, in an article in *Pravda* entitled "The Final Outline of the Marshall Plan," rebuked the Marshall Plan and the "Western European Bloc" being organized from it as a post-war Munich. He said: "This is a revival of despicable and sinful anti-communist policies. This time, the United States appears not as a facilitator, but as the main director, while Britain and France play the role of minor partners." Marinin concluded: "The re-edition of the Munich policy has only one ending, and that is that its initiators will suffer an even greater defeat than the original. American expansionists are clearly intoxicated by 'victory.' Very well! They will fall even harder, and their product—the Marshall Plan—will go bankrupt even more fiercely and miserably."

　　马歇尔计划与西欧集团是卑鄙的反共政策复活
    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科讯：马里宁以“马歇尔计划的最后轮廓”为题，在真理报上撰文斥责马歇尔计划及由此而正在组织的“西欧集团”为战后慕尼黑，他说：“这是卑鄙而罪恶的反共政策的复活。这次，美国不以促成者，而以主要的导演人的姿态出现，而英法则充当小搭挡的配角”。马里宁结语说：“慕尼黑政策的再版只有一个下场，那就是它的发起人将遭到比原版更大的惨败。美国扩张分子显然被‘胜利’冲昏了头脑。好罢！这样就会跌的更重，而它们的出产物——马歇尔计划，就会破产得更凶更惨。”
