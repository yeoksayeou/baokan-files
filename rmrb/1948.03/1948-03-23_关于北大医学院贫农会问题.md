　　Regarding the Peasant Association of Peking University Medical College, Comrade Wang Ruisheng:
　　Your letter has been received. The issue of establishing a Peasant Association at Peking University Medical College no longer needs further discussion. The Border Region Government issued instructions on the rectification of schools at all levels on the 6th of this month, pointing out: "Schools are educational institutions, and the class line in education should be manifested as a strong ideological leadership of New Democracy. Establishing poor peasant organizations in schools and applying the methods of rural struggle against landlords to school life must be corrected." Furthermore, the Peking University Party Committee has already disbanded the Medical College's Peasant Association. Therefore, your opinion on Comrade Ruo Ning's "Discussion on the Establishment of the Peasant Association at Peking University Medical College" will not be published. If you still have ideological issues you don't understand, you can carefully study Item 3 of the Central Bureau's February 1st instructions regarding the explanation of the class line. You should recognize that a complete class line is not an isolated poor peasant line. Your statement that Comrade Ruo Ning "lacks class analysis and evaluation of the basic spirit of establishing the Peasant Association at Peking University Medical College" is based on your misunderstanding. It is hoped that you will further consult Comrade Kai Feng's explanation of the class line in schools in the news item "Northeast Holds Middle School Education Conference" in the March 4th issue of this newspaper: "There should be class viewpoints and class lines in schools, but this should mainly be ideological leadership, the ideological leadership of New Democracy. Having the ideological leadership of New Democracy means having a class line. Without the ideological leadership of New Democracy, there is no class line. At the same time, the mass line in schools should only focus on striving for ideologically progressive students, and should not be based solely on the good or bad family background of students." This problem can then be resolved.

### 关于北大医学院贫农会问题

专栏：来往读编

　　关于北大医学院贫农会问题王瑞生同志：
    来信收到，关于北大医学院成立贫农会问题已无须再做商讨，本月六日边府颁发关于整顿各级学校指示中已指出：“学校是教育机关，教育的阶级路线应表现为新民主主义的坚强的思想领导，在学校内建立贫雇组织，以及拿乡村斗争地主的一套办法，套进学校生活，是必须纠正的。”而北大学委总会也早已解散了医学院的贫农会，所以你对若宁同志“对北大医学院成立贫农会的商榷”的意见，不再发表，如你思想上还有闹不通的地方，可仔细研究中央局二、一指示中第三项关于阶级路线的解释，应认识完整的阶级路线，并不是孤立的贫雇路线，你说若宁同志“对北大医学院成立贫农会的基本精神，欠缺阶级观点的分析和评价”，是你的认识有错误，希望你再参考三月四日本报东北举行中学教育会议一新闻中，凯丰同志关于学校中的阶级路线的解释：“学校中是应该有阶级观点、阶级路线的，但这主要的应该是思想领导，是新民主主义的思想领导。有新民主主义的思想领导，就是有阶级路线。没有新民主主义的思想领导，就是没有阶级路线。同时学校中的群众路线，也只能是争取思想上进步的学生为主，而不应单纯的根据学生家庭成份的好坏为主。”这个问题就可闹通了。　　　　　　编者
