　　Middle Peasants Understand the Land Law
  　Secure in Production and Full of Enthusiasm
    [Jincheng News] It has been two months since the promulgation of the Land Law Outline. Because the county and district party cadres all went to the prefectural committee to study, and the village cadres did not study, they did not correctly understand the spirit of the Land Law Outline. Therefore, they could not carry out propaganda and education to the poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants. Although each village has successively organized poor peasant and farm laborer groups, they have not intensified their class education and study of the Land Law Outline. Therefore, the poor peasant and farm laborer groups did not know what they should do or what role they should play. Because the masses did not understand the correct spirit of the Land Law Outline, the average middle peasant had a waiting and fearful mentality. The middle peasants were ideologically afraid that all their land would be taken out and redistributed equally. Now that the land has been plowed, most middle peasants have not yet delivered manure to the land. Most of the village cadres who gained fruit are also uneasy. Some even eat and drink extravagantly and do not deliver manure to prepare for spring plowing. After the poor peasant and farm laborer groups were established in each village, the village cadres began to be passive and shirked their responsibilities. When there was official business, they pushed it to the poor peasant and farm laborer groups. A district cadre in the Second District said: "When the task of supporting the war came, the village cadres were unwilling to lead the laborers and asked the poor peasants and farm laborers to lead them. They also asked the poor peasants to go to the bank to borrow money themselves. This bias was corrected somewhat after the district cadres explained it." In order to enable the masses to understand the Land Law Outline, break the waiting and fearful thoughts of the masses, and seize the time to prepare for spring plowing, Dongdayang Town specifically convened a mass meeting on the morning of February 28 to publicize the Land Law Outline, resolutely affirmed that the Land Law is also beneficial to the middle peasants, and called on everyone to quickly deliver manure.

    [Lin County News] Before the Land Law Outline was publicized in Langlei Village, most of the middle peasants were not at ease in production. After the New Year's publicity, they began to produce and deliver manure with peace of mind. Guo Lihu, a new middle peasant, and his wife built a five-room building, which took them three years. They worked on the land when they were busy, and repaired it in their spare time. They never went to bed early at night. It was almost finished, with only the doors, windows, and floorboards left. After the Land Law came out, he was uneasy day and night, and he did not do any work. After reading the newspaper and publicizing the Land Law Q&A on the street on the first day of the new year, he learned that the middle peasants' floating wealth would not be touched. However, he was still afraid that it was not insured. When a mass meeting was held for publicity, he ran to the meeting to listen before he was relieved. After that, he got up at five o'clock and worked hard in the dark, went to the land to produce during the day, and repaired doors and windows after dinner with great enthusiasm. He said to others: "I didn't understand it myself, and I didn't work for seven or eight days, and I suffered a loss." Zhang Lizhi, a middle peasant in Shicun, was afraid after hearing about the equal distribution, and he did not deliver manure, saying: "I sent it to the land, but I don't know who it will be given to?" After this publicity, he understood and said: "It is still necessary to discuss the movement of land for wealthy middle peasants, what am I afraid of?" Then he was relieved to produce. Before and after the publicity, it was obviously two different things. (Hou Zhennan)

　　中农懂得土地法
  　安心生产劲头大
    【晋城消息】土地法大纲公布后，已有两个月了，因县区党员干部都到地委学习，村干也没有学习，因此就没有正确的领会土地法大纲的精神，所以就不能向贫雇农和中农进行宣传和教育。各村虽然都先后组织了贫雇小组，但没有对他们加紧阶级教育和学习土地法大纲，所以贫雇小组也不知道应干些什么，起啥作用，由于群众没领会到土地法大纲的正确精神，一般中农都起了等待恐惧的心理，中农思想上害怕把他们全部土地拿出来打乱平分；现在地已开了，但中农大多还没有往地送粪。各村多得了果实的村干部情绪也不安，甚至有的大吃大喝，也不送粪准备春耕。各村贫雇小组成立起来后，村干部开始消极怠工不负责任，一有了公事就推给贫雇小组去干，二区一个区干部说：“参战支差任务来了，村干部不愿去带领民夫，叫贫雇农带领去，向银行贷款也叫贫雇农亲自去贷。这种偏向经区干解释，才纠正了些”。东大阳镇为了使群众了解土地法大纲，打破群众等待、恐惧思想，抓紧时间准备春耕，特于二月二十八号上午召开了群众大会宣传土地法大纲，坚决肯定的说明土地法对中农也是有利的，号召大家赶快送粪。

    【林县消息】郎垒村在土地法大纲宣传前，大部中农不安心生产，经年关宣传后，都安心的开始生产送粪。新中农郭理虎，他和他女人二人盖了五间楼，共用了三年功夫，忙时上地，抽空即修，晚上从来没早睡过觉。快修的差不多了，只拉下门窗和楼板，土地法下来后，他心上日夜不安，各样活也不作了，经初一在街上读报和宣传土地法问答，他才知道了中农浮财不动，可是又怕不保险，在开大会宣传时，又跑在大会上听，才放下心，此后又起五更搭黑干，白天上地生产，吃罢晚饭就修门窗，劲头很大，并向别人说：“自己没弄通，打了七、八天没作活，吃了亏。”还有石村中农张立滋，听到平分后害怕，粪也不送，说：“送上地，还不知道给了谁？”经这次宣传后，他弄通了说：“富裕中农光动点地还要商量，我怕啥？”才安了心生产。宣传前与宣传后显然是两个样。（侯振南）
