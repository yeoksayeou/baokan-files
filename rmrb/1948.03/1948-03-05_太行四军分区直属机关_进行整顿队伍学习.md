Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Directly Subordinate Organs
 Conduct Rectification of the Ranks Study
    [Taihang News] The directly subordinate organs of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district (Headquarters, Political Department, Supply Department, Telephone Bureau, Special Service Company, Engineer Company, Cultural Troupe, etc.), held a mobilization meeting on the morning of February 22nd at their location to rectify the ranks. At the meeting, Commander Han called on every comrade to correct their attitude and honestly and loyally resolve to dig out the rotten flesh. He said: "The people of the whole country are looking forward to us overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible and demanding the equal distribution of land, but the thoughts and actions of many comrades are very impure, and there are serious landlord and rich peasant thoughts, sheltering landlord and rich peasant families, demanding preferential treatment, engaging in corruption and waste, indulging in pleasure, beating and scolding the masses... These are all manifestations of impurity within our party. We must thoroughly liquidate these bad thoughts, investigate class, investigate thoughts, investigate officer-soldier relations. Only by exposing and thoroughly and cleanly liquidating can we stand on the side of the people and be a good hired hand for the people, and only then will we progress ourselves, and only then will our party's army be supported by the broad masses and be able to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek quickly with a hundred battles and a hundred victories." The Sub-district Outpost News, in order to ensure the smooth development of the study for the entire sub-district troops, specially published a short article, calling on all commanders and fighters in the sub-district to stand on the party's position and boldly and honestly expose, recognize their own mistakes, and conduct detailed exposure from combat, land reform, mass relations, officer-soldier relations, various policies, and personal private life. Finally, it was proposed that this is a bathing movement that everyone must check and no one can miss. Only by washing ourselves clean can we be a good hired hand for the people.
