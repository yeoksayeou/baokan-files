Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Tokyo dispatch: On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, more than 5,000 members of the Japanese Government and Public Employees Union held a demonstration in the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace amidst light rain, demanding that the reactionary authorities provide a minimum wage and withdraw the order to dismiss workers. The demonstrators marched to the parliament and the prime minister's official residence, declaring that if their demands were not allowed, they would take "collective leave" starting from March 8th. Prior to this, the Railway Workers' Union, which has 500,000 members, also held a 24-hour strike for three days from the 25th to the 27th, demanding wage increases and subsidies. 16,000 workers in the Osaka area Postal and Telecommunications Ministry decided to start a strike of the same nature on March 1st, and demanded that workers not be dismissed due to layoffs.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Last year, the Japanese working class, disregarding MacArthur's reactionary order to stop all strike activities, carried out a sustained struggle to win wages and improve working conditions, and demonstrated astonishing strength. According to official statistics released by the Tokyo Labor Ministry on February 28, in December 1947 alone, 1,935,000 workers participated in labor unrest, with a total of 69 labor disputes occurring. Throughout the year, there were a total of 776 labor disputes, with a total of 2,655,000 workers participating in labor unrest. In 1946, there were 910 labor disputes, with 2,716,000 workers participating in labor unrest. (Note: There are approximately 17,000 local trade unions in Japan, and there are two major national trade union groups, organizing approximately 2,750,000 workers. A total of 5 million workers across the country have joined trade unions.)

    【新华社陕北三日电】东京讯：上月二十八日下午，日政府及公共机关雇员工会五千余会员，在细雨霏霏中于日皇宫前广场举行示威，要求反动当局给予最低工资，并收回辞退工人的命令。示威者向议会及首相官邸游行，宣称：如不允许他们的要求，将自三月八日起“集体请假”。在此之前，拥有五十万会员的铁道工人工会，于二十五至二十七三天内，亦举行二十四小时罢工，要求增资及津贴。大坂地区递信省一万六千工人，决于三月一日开始同样性质的罢工，并要求不因裁员而解雇工人。
