Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th—Production in various factories in Andong City has been continuously increasing since Andong was re-liberated in June of last year. Despite extremely difficult conditions, the Andong Textile Factory has been working on recovery for over eight months, producing more than 770,000 catties of yarn and over 3,000 bolts of cloth. In July of last year, only 28,530 catties of yarn were produced, but now the monthly output is 172,000 catties, a more than five-fold increase. The newly constructed second plant of the factory has doubled its spindles, and now it can also produce 160,000 catties of yarn per month. The third plant's 20,000 spindles are nearing completion and will soon be operational. The Guanghua Cotton Mill has also gradually increased its production efficiency. For example, in January, female weaving workers averaged 0.8 bolts of cloth per person per day, which increased to one bolt in February. Workers at the Xinmin Clothing Factory are rushing to produce uniforms to ensure that soldiers have single-layer clothing in time, and the daily output has increased by half compared to before. Female worker Wang Shuling averages eleven sets per day, setting a new factory record. Since the shock competition, workers at the Tongxin Tobacco Company have greatly improved their productivity, with an average of 457 packs of cigarettes packed per person per day, an increase of 35 percent, and the number of cigarettes rolled has increased to over 10,140, an increase of over 27 percent.

　　安东市被解放后各工厂生产激增
    【新华社东北二十五日电】安东市各工厂生产不断增加。安东纺织厂自去年六月安东重获解放后，在极端困难的条件下进行恢复，到现在八个多月共生产纱七十七万余斤，布三千余匹。去年七月份只产纱二万八千五百三十余斤，现在一个月即产十七万二千斤，提高五倍多。该厂新建设的第二厂锭子发展了一倍，现在每月也能产纱十六万斤。第三厂的二万锭子已将完成，不久亦可开工。光华棉织厂生产效率亦逐渐提高，如织布女工一月份平均每人每日织布十分之八匹，二月份已达一匹。新民被服厂工友为保证战士及时穿上单衣，现正赶制军衣，每天出品量较前增一半。女工王淑苓每天平均做十一套，创造了全厂的最高纪录。同新烟草公司工友自突击竞赛后，生产率大大提高，包烟每人每天平均包四百五十七条，较前提高百分之三十五，卷烟则增到一万零一百四十余支，提高百分之二十七强。
