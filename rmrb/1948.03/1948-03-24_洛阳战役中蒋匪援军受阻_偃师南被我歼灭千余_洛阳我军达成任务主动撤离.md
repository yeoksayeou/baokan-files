　　Luoyang Campaign: Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Reinforcements Blocked
　　Over a Thousand Chiang Kai-shek Troops Annihilated South of Yanshi
　　Our Troops Achieve Objectives in Luoyang and Voluntarily Withdraw
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 22nd] Belated news: During the Luoyang Campaign, a unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) blocked Chiang Kai-shek bandit reinforcements in the Yanshi and Dengfeng areas from the 10th to the 14th, killing and wounding over 1,400 of them. When the PLA attacked Luoyang, Chiang Kai-shek's Sun Yuanliang Corps' 124th Brigade, 177th Brigade, 55th Brigade, 125th Brigade (i.e., the newly formed Second Rapid Column), and Hu Lian Corps' 118th Brigade of the 11th Division and the 11th Brigade respectively came to reinforce from Zhengzhou and Xuchang. The PLA had already controlled key locations such as Yanshi and Black Stone Pass, cutting off the Zhengzhou-Luoyang traffic. Sun Yuanliang's four brigades were blocked and unable to advance. By the night of the 14th, when the PLA had completely captured Luoyang, Sun's advance troops had only reached the area south of Yanshi City, advancing less than 15 li per day on average. At the same time, the PLA fiercely attacked the advance brigade of Hu Lian's bandit troops from the Xuchang area in northwestern Dengfeng. Until the night of the 14th, the enemy was still blocked in the area south of Yanshi.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 22nd] A spokesman for the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei PLA Frontline Headquarters recently announced: Our troops voluntarily withdrew from Luoyang City at 5:00 AM on the 18th. He stated: This time, a main force of our army advanced into the Longhai Railway, and after five days and nights of fierce fighting, liberated the central plains' important town of Luoyang on the evening of the 14th, completely annihilating the defending Chiang Kai-shek bandit Youth Army 206th Division and all its military and political organs, killing and capturing over 18,000 enemy troops, and seizing a large number of spoils of war. Our army's current operational policy is to annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's active forces, regardless of the gains or losses of a single city or place. The 206th Division annihilated this time was Chiang Kai-shek's well-equipped "Party Guards." The materials and weapons our army obtained are enough to equip several brigades. Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency has been fabricating rumors for days to cover up its heavy losses and concocting so-called "battle results," precisely exposing its utter boredom, while its heart is panic-stricken, worrying about the direction of our army's iron fist in the next attack. The spokesperson concluded: Luoyang will ultimately belong to the people; this is only a matter of time.

　　洛阳战役中蒋匪援军受阻
    偃师南被我歼灭千余
    洛阳我军达成任务主动撤离
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十二日电】迟到消息，洛阳战役中，解放军一部于十日至十四日在偃师、登封地区阻击增援蒋匪，毙伤其一千四百余人。当解放军进攻洛阳时，蒋匪孙元良兵团之一二四旅、一七七旅、五十五旅、一二五旅（即新编第二快速纵队），及胡琏兵团之整十一师一一八旅与十一旅分别自郑州、许昌往援。解放军早已控制偃师及黑石关等要地，将郑洛交通切断，孙匪元良之四个旅被阻未能前进，直至十四日夜解放军已全部攻占洛阳时，孙匪先头部队尚仅进至偃师城南地区，平均每天前进不到十五里，与此同时，解放军在登封西北痛击自许昌地区西援之胡琏匪部先头一个旅，直至十四日夜，该敌尚被阻于偃师以南地区。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十二日电】豫陕鄂解放军前线司令部发言人顷宣布：我军十八日晨五时，主动撤离洛阳城。并称：此次我军以一部主力挺进陇海路，经五昼夜激战，十四日晚解放中原重镇洛阳，全歼守城蒋匪青年军二○六师及其全部军政机关，毙俘敌一万八千余名，缴获胜利品极多。当前我军作战方针，在于歼灭蒋匪有生力量，不计一城一地之得失。此次所歼二○六师乃蒋匪装备优良之“党卫军”，我军所获物资武器，足够装备若干个旅、蒋匪中央社为掩盖其惨重损失，连日大造谣言，捏造所谓“战果”，恰恰暴露了他的穷极无聊，而其内心则恐慌万状，正耽心我军铁拳下一次的打击方向。发言人最后说：洛阳终将属于人民的，这不过是时间问题罢了。
