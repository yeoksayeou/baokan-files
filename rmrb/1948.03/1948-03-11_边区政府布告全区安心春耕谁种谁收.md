The Border Region Government Proclaims the Whole Region to Focus on Spring Plowing, Whoever Plants, Harvests

[Our newspaper's dispatch] In order to ensure that the masses do not miss the farming season and can focus on spring plowing and production during the consolidation of the Party rectification democratic movement, the Border Region Government specifically issued a proclamation on March 8th, the original text of which is as follows:

The spring plowing season has arrived, and it is of utmost importance that all people in our border region promptly plow the land and sow seeds, without leaving any land uncultivated. Recently, it has been heard that some people, because land reform is underway and some land rights have not been finally determined, are deeply afraid that their land will be distributed to others in the future, resulting in their own cultivation benefiting others, which is not worthwhile. Therefore, they are adopting a wait-and-see, passive attitude towards spring plowing. This will inevitably delay the farming season, waste land, affect production, and even lead to disaster. In fact, in the old and semi-old areas of our border region, after the movements of rent and interest reduction, anti-traitor liquidation, and leveling and supplementing, land has been largely evenly distributed, and land rights have been largely determined. In the future, the implementation of the "Outline Land Law of China" will only require minor adjustments within a smaller scope. There will definitely not be a disruptive redistribution, and there will definitely not be a large transfer of land or changes in land rights. Everyone really does not need to worry. As for any changes in land rights after spring plowing and sowing due to supplementation results, the government will definitely guarantee that the original cultivators have complete harvesting rights. To this end, the following four provisions are hereby announced:

First, all land that has been allocated and adjusted and confirmed before Qingming Festival this year should be reported to the government immediately to determine land rights, and cultivated and harvested by the land recipients.

Second, for all land allocated and adjusted and confirmed before Qingming Festival this year, if the original cultivator has already sown seeds (wheat land or autumn land) before the allocation and adjustment, even if the ownership of the land changes, the summer or autumn produce of the land is guaranteed to still belong to the original cultivator (including landlords and rich peasants) and shall not be divided equally.

Third, for all land allocated and adjusted and confirmed before Qingming Festival this year, if the original cultivator has not sown seeds before the allocation and adjustment, but has already plowed the land and applied fertilizer or performed other labor, the land recipients should provide fair and equivalent compensation to the original cultivator for the capital and labor consumed, after evaluation by the village peasants' association.

Fourth, all land that has not been allocated and adjusted and confirmed before Qingming Festival this year will continue to be cultivated by the original cultivator. Regardless of who owns the land after spring plowing, the crops for this year will still belong to the original cultivator and will not be subject to equal distribution.

In addition to ordering all administrative offices to instruct their subordinate governments at all levels to comply with the above regulations, this proclamation is hereby issued for the information of the entire region. It is hoped that all compatriots in the region will focus on production and immediately and actively carry out spring plowing in order to improve their own lives and support the victorious patriotic self-defense war. Do not have any doubts or slack off.

### 边区政府布告全区安心春耕谁种谁收

　　边区政府布告全区安心春耕谁种谁收
    【本报消息】为了在填补整党民主运动中使群众能不违农时，安心春耕生产，边区政府特于三月八日发布布告，原文如下：
    春耕季节已到，凡我边区人民都要及时犁地下种，不荒土地，关系至巨。近闻有些人因土地改革正在进行，部分地权还没有最后确定，深怕自己的土地将来分给别人，落个自己耕种别人收获，太不合算，因而对于春耕便抱着观望等待的消极态度，这样必致贻误农时，荒芜土地，影响生产，甚至会形成灾荒。其实，本边区之老区与半老区，经过减租减息、反奸清算与填平补齐等运动，土地已达到大体平分，地权也就算大体确定，今后执行中国土地法大纲，只须在较小范围内抽补调剂，决不是打乱平分，决不会再有大量的土地转移与地权的变动，大家实在没有顾虑的必要。至于在春耕下种后，如有因抽补结果而地权变动者，政府也必保证原耕种人有完全的收获权。为此，特宣布下列四项规定：
    第一、凡土地在今年清明节前，已经分配调剂确定者，应即呈报政府，确定地权，由得地人耕种并收获。
    第二、凡在今年清明节前分配调剂确定的土地，其在分配确定之前，已由原耕种人下种者（麦地或秋地），则土地所有权虽有变更，但该土地的夏季或秋季的生产物，保证仍各归原耕种人（包括地主富农在内）所有，不得平分。
    第三、凡在今年清明节前，分配调剂确定之土地，在分配调剂确定前，原耕种人虽没有播种，但已经犁地上粪或进行过其它劳作者，应由得地人对原耕种人所消耗的资本和劳力，经过该村农会评定，给予公平等价的补偿。
    第四、凡在今年清明节前，没有分配调剂确定之地，该土地仍由原耕种人耕种。不论春耕后该土地归谁所有，其本年农作物，仍归原耕种人所有，不在平分之列。
    以上规定，除令各行署转令所属各级政府遵办外，特布告周知，希全区同胞，安心生产，立即积极进行春耕，以改善自己的生活，并支援胜利的爱国自卫战争，万勿稍有疑虑和懈怠。
