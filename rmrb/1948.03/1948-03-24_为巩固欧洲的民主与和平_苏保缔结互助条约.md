　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Moscow dispatch: After several days of talks between Stalin, Molotov, and the Bulgarian delegation led by Dimitrov, the two sides signed a 20-year Soviet-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in the Kremlin on the 18th, in order to strengthen cooperation between the two countries and ensure world peace. The treaty was signed by Molotov and Dimitrov on behalf of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria respectively. Stalin himself was present to witness the signing. The main points of the treaty are as follows: First, the two contracting parties agree that, in the event of a threat of renewed aggression by Germany or any country directly or indirectly colluding with Germany, they shall jointly make every effort to take all measures to eliminate it. If either contracting party enters into a state of war with the aforementioned countries, the other contracting party shall immediately provide military and other assistance to the best of its ability. Both parties declare their willingness to participate in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security with the most sincere spirit of cooperation, and to fully contribute to the realization of this lofty mission. Second, neither party shall conclude any alliance directed against the other contracting party, nor shall participate in any alliance, action, or measure against the other contracting party. Third, the two parties shall consult with each other on major international issues relating to the common interests of both countries. Fourth, in a spirit of friendship and cooperation, the two parties shall develop and consolidate economic and cultural relations between the two countries, in accordance with the principles of mutual respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Moscow dispatch: Molotov and Dimitrov delivered speeches successively after the signing of the Soviet-Bulgarian Mutual Assistance Treaty on the 18th. Molotov said: "The foundation of this treaty is the principle of respecting national independence and sovereignty, and it serves to consolidate European democracy, peace, and security. The purpose of this treaty is to avoid renewed German aggression. Naturally, the Soviet Union, which shouldered the heavy burden of opposing fascist aggression, particularly supports every step to prevent and prepare to repel possible new imperialist attempts at aggression. I wish the fraternal Bulgarian people complete success in building a new democratic Bulgaria! The Soviet Union, faithful to the principles of Lenin and Stalin's policies, has supported and will continue to steadfastly support the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Long live the sacred and inviolable alliance! Long live Soviet-Bulgarian friendship!" Then, Dimitrov delivered a speech, stating: "This treaty fully accords with the vital interests of the people of our two countries and reflects the hopes most cherished in their hearts. The implementation of this treaty will inspire our people to be even more active in building the People's Republic of Bulgaria, making it a healthy factor for democracy and peace in the Balkans, and making more constructive efforts along the socialist path."
