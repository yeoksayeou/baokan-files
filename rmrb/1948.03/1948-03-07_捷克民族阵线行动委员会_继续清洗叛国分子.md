Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Prague dispatch: "No one can shield traitors," declared Czech Minister of Justice Čepička, calling on the people to directly report facts of treason. The National Front Action Committee has begun purging the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The purge of other ministries, agencies, and schools is continuing. Prague Deputy Mayor Idanto (People's Party), Bratislava Mayor Kubat, and parliamentarians Ušin and Žusko (all of the Slovak Democratic Party) have been reported for substantiated treason. Several ringleaders of reactionary parties have been identified as the main culprits of treason. Public security organs have proven that the Central Secretariat of the People's Party in Bratislava was the central organ of Slovak treasonous activities and have inspected it. The reactionary provost (British) of Karlova University has been removed from his post. Professors Vostada and Matila, who defended Nazi atrocities, have been expelled from the Faculty of Law and Politics. The Student Action Committee has decided that all student organizations must rejoin the Youth League.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Prague dispatch: Progressive intellectuals in Czechoslovakia held a mass meeting here on February 29 to discuss current tasks. Prime Minister Gottwald sent a letter to the meeting, praising "the intellectuals for demonstrating true progress in the recent events, keeping pace with the people and the country." Gottwald told the intellectuals that the aging capitalist system had turned them into tools of exploitation against the people, while the Czech people value the work of experts and intellectuals. Gottwald called on intellectuals to serve the people and the country loyally and selflessly.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Prague dispatch: The Red Flag newspaper recently published an article exposing the American and British reactionaries as the commanders of the Czechoslovak traitorous conspirators. The article pointed out: It is now clear that there are three conspiracy centers abroad: the first center is related to former US Ambassadors to Moscow and Paris, Bullitt, who maintains close contact with traitors who have fled Eastern Europe; the second center is led by a certain diplomat stationed in Rome, who is closely connected with the world's largest banking group and Slovak war criminal Ďurčanský; the third center is in London, where any plan against people's democracy is supported not only by Churchill and his "United Europe Committee" but also by prominent Labour Party leaders. The article pointed out that domestic and foreign reactionaries fear that the results of the London Conference, where Britain, the United States, and France discussed the revival of Nazi Germany, will alert the Czech people, and therefore are preparing to launch a coup before the end of the three-nation conference. Another reason why the reactionaries chose this time to prepare for rebellion, according to Czech Ambassador to Poland Killet in Warsaw, is the fear that more progressive socio-economic programs and a new constitution will be adopted after the general election. A recent commentary in the Izvestia provides a deeper analysis of the Czech events, saying that, as in other new democracies, American and British expansionists rely on Czech reactionaries and have decided to undermine the unity of the democratic front from within in order to create the preconditions for including Czechoslovakia in the Marshall Plan. The slanderous joint declaration of the United States, Britain, and France against Czechoslovakia, as well as the economic pressure exerted by the US State Department on Czechoslovakia, are not only expressions of an attempt to interfere in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs but also show that US, British, and French officials openly stand with the Czech traitors.

　　捷克民族阵线行动委员会
  　继续清洗叛国分子
    【新华社陕北五日电】布拉格讯：“谁也不能包庇叛国分子”，这是捷司法部长契皮茨卡在号召人民直接检举叛国分子的事实时宣布的。民族阵线行动委员会已开始清洗外交部和司法部。其他各部与机关学校的清洗工作正在继续中。布拉格副市长伊单托（人民党）、波拉的斯拉发市长库巴特、议员乌辛尔、助斯科（均为斯洛伐克民主党），都因叛国有据而被检举。反动政党党魁多人，都被查明为叛国主犯。公安机关证明，波拉的斯拉发人民党中央书记处是斯洛伐克叛国活动的中央机关，并予检查。卡里瓦大学反动教务长（英国人）被撤职，伏斯达和马提拉两教授曾为纳粹暴行辩护，被赶出法政学校。学生行动委员会决定，所有学生团体都要重新参加青年联盟。
    【新华社陕北五日电】布拉格讯：捷克进步的知识分子，于二月二十九日在此间举行群众大会，讨论当前任务。总理哥特瓦尔德致函大会，赞扬“知识分子在最近事变中表现了真正的进步，跟着人民与国家齐步前进”，哥氏告诉知识分子说：衰老的资本主义制度把他们变为反人民的剥削工具，而捷人民则重视专家和知识分子的工作。哥氏号召知识分子忠诚忘我地为人民为国家的利益而服务。
    【新华社陕北五日电】布拉格讯：红旗报近登载一文，揭露美英反动派是捷克叛国阴谋分子的指挥者。该文指出：现在很清楚，在外国有三个阴谋中心：第一个中心是与前美国驻莫斯科与驻巴黎大使布立特有关，布立特和由东欧逃跑出去的卖国贼保持密切联系；第二个中心是由驻罗马的某外交家所领导，而这一外交家则和世界上最大的银行集团及斯洛伐克战犯杜赞斯基保持密切联系；第三个中心是在伦敦，在那里任何反对人民民主的计划，不仅得到邱吉尔及其“统一欧洲委员会”的支持，而且得到著名的工党领袖的支持。该文指出：国内外反动派害怕英美法三国讨论复活纳粹德国的伦敦会议之结果，将警觉捷国人民，因此准备在三国会议结束前发动政变。反动派选择这一时机准备叛乱的另一原因，据捷驻波大使基里特在华沙向记者谈，是害怕大选之后通过更进步的社会经济纲领，通过新宪法。消息报在最近评论中更深刻分析捷克事件说：如象在其他新民主主义国家一样，美英扩张主义者依靠捷克反动派，决定从内部来破坏民主阵线的团结，以便制造先决条件，把捷克包括在马歇尔计划以内。美英法对捷的诽谤式的联合宣言，以及美国务院对捷所施的经济压力，不仅是妄图干涉捷内政的表示，而且说明美英法官方人士公开的和捷克叛国分子站在一起。
