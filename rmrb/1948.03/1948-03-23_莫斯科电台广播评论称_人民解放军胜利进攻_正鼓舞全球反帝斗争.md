      Moscow Radio Broadcast Comments that the Victorious Offensive of the People's Liberation Army is Encouraging the Global Anti-Imperialist Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st – A commentary by Masinu broadcast by Moscow Radio on the 29th of last month and the 5th of this month, pointed out that because American imperialism is attempting to turn China into a base for the United States to enslave the whole of Asia and the Far East, the victorious offensive launched by the Chinese People's Liberation Army is of great significance, as it is encouraging the largest number of oppressed people to carry out struggle, and this struggle is shaking the foundations of global imperialism. In order to suppress and enslave hundreds of millions of people in the East, in addition to rapidly restoring the reactionary forces in Japan and Korea, American imperialism is stepping up its assistance to the Kuomintang in carrying out a counter-revolutionary war against the Chinese people. Masinu continued by saying: The US State Department's $570 million in aid is to supply the Kuomintang's millions of troops with food and clothing, support the Kuomintang's police and bureaucrats, and ensure the supply of gasoline and transportation equipment, in addition to continuing to supply arms, military supplies and ammunition. However, all of this will be powerless to change the course of events in China, and it will never be able to save Chiang Kai-shek from his doom.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st – TASS, Shanghai, 18th – Six well-known professors from Tsinghua, Yenching, and Peking Universities in Beiping recently wrote articles in the "Yenching News," a journal run by Yenching University students, unanimously opposing American imperialism's aid to Chiang Kai-shek. Professors Wu Han, Xu Deheng, Lei Jieqiong and two others unanimously opposed the American imperialists' plan to turn China into a "second Greece" under the pretext of "aiding China" in their articles, and vehemently criticized the fallacy of "resuming negotiations," asserting that "the Chinese people's liberation struggle brooks no delay." Zhang Dongsun also pointed out in his article: "America's aid to Chiang is absolutely incompatible with the national interests of the Chinese people, therefore the Chinese people must oppose it." TASS quoted opinions from Shanghai press circles as saying: Under the Kuomintang's reactionary terror, the brave actions of these professors in Beiping prove that the Chinese people's revolutionary movement is increasingly winning the hearts of the people in North China, and that the Chinese people's opposition to American imperialism is growing stronger.

      莫斯科电台广播评论称
   　人民解放军胜利进攻  正鼓舞全球反帝斗争
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科电台上月二十九日及本月五日广播马西努的评论，指出由于美国帝国主义妄图将中国变为美国奴役整个亚洲与远东的基地，中国人民解放军举行胜利的进攻，就具有重大意义，它正在鼓舞着最大数量的被压迫人民去进行斗争，而这个斗争正在动摇全世界帝国主义的基础。美帝国主义为镇压与奴役东方十万万人民，除火速恢复日本和朝鲜等地的反动力量外，正加紧帮助国民党进行反对中国人民的反革命战争。马西努继称：美国务院五亿七千万美元的援助，就是为了供应国民党几百万军队的粮食和服装，养活国民党的警察和官僚，保证汽油和运输器材等的供应，此外还准备继续供给军火、军需品和弹药。但是所有这些都将无力改变中国事变发展的进程，它决不能挽救蒋介石的死亡命运。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社上海十八日电：北平清华、燕大、北大等校名教授六人，日前在燕大学生所办刊物“燕京新闻”撰文，一致反对美帝援蒋。吴晗、许德珩、雷洁琼等五教授文中一致反对美帝国主义借口“援助中国”变中国为“希腊第二”的计划，并痛斥“恢复谈判”的谬论，力称：“中国人民的解放斗争不容片刻停顿”。张东荪文中亦指出：“美国的援华（蒋）是与中国人民的民族利益绝不相容的，因此中国人民必须反对它。”塔斯社引上海报界人士意见称：在国民党反动恐怖下，北平这些教授的勇敢行动，证明了中国人民革命运动愈益深得华北人心，和中国人民反对美帝国主义情绪的愈益增长。
