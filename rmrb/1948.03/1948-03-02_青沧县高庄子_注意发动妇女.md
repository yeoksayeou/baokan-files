Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Electric Dispatch: Gaozhuangzi Village in Qingcang County was only liberated in June of last year during the Qing (County) Cang (County) campaign. In the past, land reform had not been implemented in the village, and women's work was even more lacking in foundation. Usually, women did not attend mass meetings. The district work team organized a poor peasant association in the village, but not a single woman participated. Several calls to action were ineffective. Calling on male peasants to mobilize women also did not work. Later, a poor peasant association of more than 30 people was formed, and preliminary group divisions were made, and temporary representatives were selected, but the women were still unmoved. The work team then conducted a self-criticism, recognizing that the work was not thorough, did not follow the mass line, and did not mobilize men and women together, leaving women's work behind.

(A) Based on the above situation, the district work team emphasized the need to organize women at the poor peasant congress. At the meeting, some male peasants said: "If other people's women can do it, fine. My woman can't, she doesn't dare to speak." Others said: "Comrades, what's the use of having women following us? Is there anything we men can't handle?" In response to this situation, the work team raised the questions: (1) Are women from poor families considered poor? (2) Should women also achieve liberation when we men achieve liberation? Let the peasants discuss. The male peasants' contempt for women and their fear of women learning bad habits were criticized on the spot, and various rumors spread by special agents in the past were exposed, so that they could correctly understand equality between men and women. (3) After this explanation, discussions were held in groups. During the discussions, backbones emerged. Zhang Qinglong and Zhang Dexin said: "I can get my woman out." This initiative changed the atmosphere of unwillingness to let women participate.

(B) How to start organizing women: (1) Expressing attitude - opened up men's concerns, and then convened a meeting of poor women. Eighteen old women and three young women attended the first meeting. First of all, the work team expressed its attitude, saying: "This time we will be liberated and no longer be bullied. Women will get a share of the land, too. In the past, landlords looked down on the poor, but today the poor will be liberated." However, everyone did not say much, only saying, "We haven't suffered much hardship, we are just poor." The work team then used examples of the poor suffering and the landlords beating and scolding the poor to guide them, and some old women shed tears at that time, but still did not express their suffering. (2) Breaking down concerns by using bitterness to evoke bitterness - they were afraid of being laughed at if they spoke of their suffering. The work team members then spoke of how their own mothers used to pick up crops in the fields at home and how they were pushed out by the landlords when they borrowed grain from them, explaining that we are all one family, and you are just like our old mothers, which then led them to speak of their suffering. (3) Raising their hatred for the landlords through complaining. For example, Zhang Qinglong's wife, who was in her fifties, had a hard life with her mother at home since she was a child. When she was 19 years old, she married into Zhang Qinglong's family. His family was also very poor. Her husband worked as a long-term laborer for others, and she worked for Zhang Qingrui, a landlord in the village, for more than a year, suffering all the pain in the world. For many years, she had to beg for food. Once, after not eating for two days, she washed clothes for Zhang Huating, a landlord in the village, for half a day, trying to beg for some food, but after the clothes were washed, the landlord said, "It's not clean," and pushed her out of the door. She cried loudly as she spoke. Later, fourteen other people complained, shocking the whole audience and increasing their hatred for the landlords, dispelling their concerns. (4) Actively discovering activists Zhang Yangshi and Zhang Qinglong's wife from the complaints, and having individual chats with them to help them understand the oppression and suffering they had suffered in the past, making them further recognize the crimes of the landlords, and explaining that this time the division would fill the poor pits and completely defeat the landlords, and the poor would be in charge. They became active. The seven or eight old women who complained connected with the poor women. In particular, Zhang Qinglong's wife, Wang Qunyang, organized women every day, forgetting to eat. She organized a total of ten poor women. Three extremely poor households did not participate in the poor peasant association, and she persuaded them three times in a row, and finally awakened the three of them. Under her leadership, fifteen poor households were organized. Now all thirty-odd poor women in the village have joined the poor peasant association, and two poor women have been elected as temporary representatives of the poor peasant association.

### 青沧县高庄子　注意发动妇女

　　青沧县高庄子
  　注意发动妇女
    【新华社晋察冀电】青沧县高庄子村是去年六月青（县）沧（县）战役才解放的，过去该村没有实行土地改革，妇女工作更是没有基础。平时开群众大会，妇女都不去参加，区工作组在该村组织贫农团，但没有一个妇女参加。几次号召始终无效。号召男农民去发动妇女，还是不行。后来组成了三十多人的贫农团，初步划分了小组，选出了临时代表，妇女还是丝毫未动。工作组即作了检讨，认识到工作不深入，不走群众路线，不是男女一齐发动，把妇女工作丢下了。
    （甲）根据以上情况，区工作组在贫雇农大会上强调提出要组织妇女。会上有的男农民说：“人家娘儿们能行，反正我那娘儿们不成，她不敢说话。”也有的说：“同志，要些娘儿们跟着作什么，有咱们什么事情办不了”。根据这种情况，工作组即提出（一）穷人家妇女算不算穷人？（二）咱们男的翻身，妇女是否应该翻身？让农民讨论。并当场批评了男农民对妇女的轻视，及怕妇女学坏了等错误看法，更揭发了过去特务的各种造谣，使他们正确认识男女平等。（三）这样解释以后，即分小组讨论，在讨论中涌现了骨干，张庆龙、张德新说：“我娘儿们能叫出来。”这样一带动，才把不愿让妇女参加的空气转变了。
    （乙）怎样着手组织妇女：（一）表明态度——打开了男人顾虑，就召开了贫苦妇女会。第一次去了十八个老大娘，三个青年妇女，首先由工作组表明态度，说：“这次咱们要翻身不受气了，平分土地咱们妇女都得一份，过去财主看不起穷人，今天穷人就要翻身。”可是大家都不多说话。只说：“也没有受过什么苦处，就是咱穷。”工作组又找穷人受罪、财主们打骂穷人的事例引导她们，当时有些老大娘落下泪来，但还是不说出苦来。（二）打破顾虑以苦引苦——她们有苦不说是怕笑话。工作组人员就说出了自己母亲过去在家中拾庄稼和向财主借粮怎样被人家财主推出来，说明咱们都是一家人，你们和我们老母亲一样，这才引出了她们的苦处。（三）从诉苦中提高她们对地主的仇恨。如张庆龙的媳妇五十多岁了，从小跟母亲在家过苦日子，到十九岁就嫁到张庆龙家来，他家又是很穷，丈夫给人家做长工，她给本村地主张庆瑞做活一年多，受尽人间痛苦，另外许多年是要饭吃，有一回两天没有吃东西，给本村地主张化廷洗了半天衣服，想求点饭吃，不想衣服洗完了，人家说：“洗的不干净”，将她推出门来，她一面说一面大哭。后来接着有十四个人诉了苦，震动了全场，增加了她们对地主的仇恨。打消了顾虑。（四）从诉苦中发现了积极分子张杨氏、与张庆龙的媳妇，就个别和她们漫谈，帮助她们认识了过去受压迫受痛苦的事。使她们进一步的认识地主的罪恶，并解释了这次平分要把穷坑填满，彻底打垮地主，穷人当家。她们就积极起来了，诉苦的七八个老太婆，在贫苦妇女中进行串连，尤其是张庆龙的媳妇王群羊每天组织妇女顾不得吃饭，她一共组织起十个贫苦妇女。有三户赤贫妇女不参加贫农团，她一连进行三次的说服工作，最后将她们三个人说得觉悟了。在她带动下，十五户贫苦妇女都组织起来了，现在全村三十多个贫雇妇女都参加了贫农团，并推选出两位贫苦妇女为贫农团的临时代表。
