  　Poor and Middle Peasants Unite and Work Together
    After the Poor Peasants' League was established in Zhao Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, they immediately worked together to organize middle peasants and form a new farmers' association. Hedong Village paid even more attention to uniting middle peasants for mutual aid in production. Activities like delivering manure and repairing land were underway. Because some people lacked furniture, they organized a blacksmith shop to make furniture. If anyone had difficulties, the farmers' association would first lend them some grain and money. Everyone was very enthusiastic, and we should learn from them. We, the poor and middle peasants, should unite and work together to improve our lives, improve democracy, and also work hard to boost production. Now some people don't quite understand, saying that when poor peasants rise up, they will struggle against middle peasants. That's the rumor of bad people, don't listen to those words. Deliver manure when you should deliver manure, repair land when you should repair land. This year, there are many tasks such as party rectification, democracy, and filling various vacancies, and we must do them all well. The work in the fields should be pushed forward, and working in your spare time won't hurt.

  　贫中农团结一道干
    武安九区赵庄村贫农团成立后，紧接着就串连组织中农成立了新农会，河东村更注意团结中农互助生产，送粪修地都动起来了，因为有人家具缺，就组织起一个铁匠炉来打家具，有人有困难就先由农会借些粮食和钱给他们，大家劲头很大，值得咱们学习，咱们中贫农团结一道干，把身翻好，把民主搞好，还得要好好闹生产。现在有人不很明白，说贫农起来，就要斗中农，那是坏人的造谣，不要听那些话，该送粪就送粪，该修地就修地，今年整党、民主和填补各种工作多，还都得要干好，地里活应该往前赶，抽空就干不吃亏。
