　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Compiling news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: In Peiping, under the rule of the Chiang bandits, the lives of ordinary citizens have fallen into dire straits. Li Si, a 50-year-old rickshaw puller from Nancaichang, died of hunger and cold while pulling his rickshaw on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Yu Tiancheng, a rickshaw puller from Nan Shang Hutong, wounded his wife and son with a kitchen knife on the eighth of last month because he had no dinner. A police officer from the Sixth Precinct of the Western Suburbs Bandit Police, due to rising prices and insufficient salary to maintain his livelihood, had his wife, Xu, take their two-year-old daughter, tie her to her chest, and throw herself into a water tank while he was at work. Some civil servants can only afford one meal a day; some work in the office during the day and pull rickshaws at night. Recently, there have been a particularly large number of beggars and prostitutes in Peiping. Everywhere people are kowtowing and begging for money and food; everywhere are emaciated prostitutes crying out, "30,000 for a night, 10,000 will do," but 10,000 yuan can only buy twelve taels of corn flour. Recently, there have been daily reports of citizens attempting suicide by lying on train tracks, jumping into rivers, or taking poison because they cannot survive. The Chiang bandits' exorbitant taxes and levies are increasing. Last year, the "city defense fee" apportioned to the Chamber of Commerce was 3.2 billion, and many people are still unable to pay it off this year; on February 24th, they demanded 100,000 pairs of shoes; and recently added a "self-defense special donation" to the necessities of citizens' lives. For example, coal is taxed one-third of the market price; fish and salt are taxed seven-thirds. In addition, they forcibly draw people's blood, and in one instance last month, they stipulated the extraction of 10,000 CC of blood.

　　北平活象人间地狱
    苦力饿死街头妓女廉价叫卖
  　到处都有乞丐叩头作揖讨饭
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋匪统治下的北平，一般市民生活已陷于绝境，南草厂的五十岁洋车夫李四因饥寒无力，竟于阴历大年初一拉车时累死在街头。南上胡同洋车夫郁天成上月八日因晚饭无着，夫妻吵架，用菜刀砍伤其妻及儿子。西郊匪警六分局某警士因物价上涨，薪水不能维持生活，妻徐氏某日趁夫上班，将两岁女儿捆在胸前，投入大水缸身死。若干公务员每天只能吃一顿饭；有的白天办公，夜间拉洋车。近来北平市上乞丐与妓女特别多，到处有人叩头作揖讨钱讨饭；到处有面黄肌瘦的妓女惨叫：“三万一夜，一万也行，”但一万元只能买到十二两玉米面。近来市民因不能生活，卧轨、投河、服毒者日有所闻。蒋匪的苛捐杂税越来越多；去年摊派商会的“城防费”三十二亿，许多人到今年还无力交清；二月二十四日又要十万双鞋；对市民生活必须品最近又加了“自卫特捐”。如煤炭照市价征税三分之一；鱼盐征七分之三。此外还强抽人民血液，上月一次即规定取血一万ＣＣ。
