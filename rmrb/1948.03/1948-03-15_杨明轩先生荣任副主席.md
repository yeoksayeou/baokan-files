Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: A brief biography of Mr. Yang Mingxuan, the newly appointed Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. Vice Chairman Yang is a renowned educator in the Northwest and the Minister of Organization for the Northwest General Branch of the Democratic League. He is currently 58 years old and hails from Yong County, Shaanxi. During the Xinhai Revolution, he participated in the student corps in Xi'an and was involved in revolutionary work. In the second year of the Republic of China, he studied in Japan and returned to China during World War I. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to Beijing Higher Normal School, where he embraced European and American democratic and scientific ideas. He organized the "Work-Study Society" and established "People's Schools" to promote work-study programs. During the May Fourth Movement, he actively opposed the traitorous Beiyang government, severely beat the traitor Zhang Zongxiang, and was arrested along with thirty other student leaders. Subsequently, he was arrested again for firmly demanding the dismissal of the traitors Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, and Lu Zongyu. After that, he served in the education sector, holding positions such as Director of the Affiliated Middle School of Shaanxi Provincial No. 1 Normal School, Dean of Academics at Weibei Middle School, and Principal of Shaanxi Provincial No. 1 Normal School, spreading new educational ideas and engaging in resolute struggles against the feudal Shaanxi provincial education authorities. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, he went to Ping, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai to study education and served as the Director of the Affiliated Middle School of Shanghai University and a lecturer in the university department, interacting with progressive figures in the domestic cultural and educational circles. In the summer of the thirteenth year, upon the invitation of Comrade Li Zizhou, a revolutionary martyr from Northern Shaanxi, he served as the Dean of Academics at Suide Fourth Normal School. Leading comrades of the Party and government in Northern Shaanxi, such as Ma Mingfang, An Ziwen, Chang Lifu, and Zhang Desheng, all received his teachings. In the winter of the fifteenth year, he served as the Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, reforming Shaanxi education and widely publishing emerging social science books, cultivating many revolutionary talents for the Northwest. After the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he resigned. In January of the seventeenth year, he was arrested and imprisoned by Song Zheyuan for a year and a month. He was released due to lack of evidence but remained under house arrest in Xi'an. He then secretly fled to Shanghai and taught at "Lida Academy." In August of the twenty-fifth year, he returned to Xi'an and organized the Northwest All Circles National Salvation Association and participated in the "Double Twelve" Incident. The following spring, due to persecution by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, he went to various Western European countries, studying education and promoting the anti-Japanese cause. He participated in the European Anti-Japanese Student Federation and the World Student Federation, voicing the just demands of Chinese youth and the Chinese people. In December of the twenty-sixth year, he returned to China, working tirelessly for the anti-Japanese and democratic movements. After Chiang's agents assassinated Mr. Li Furen in Xi'an in May of the thirty-fifth year, he was forced to flee to the Border Region in the autumn of that year. Last spring, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops frantically invaded Yan'an, and he followed the rear organs in their relocation, always concerned about the interests of the masses and never forgetting the great cause of liberating the great Northwest and liberating all of China. This time, the joint enlarged meeting of the standing members of the Border Region Assembly and the members of the Border Region Government unanimously elected him as a member of the Border Region Government and Vice Chairman of the Border Region Government.
