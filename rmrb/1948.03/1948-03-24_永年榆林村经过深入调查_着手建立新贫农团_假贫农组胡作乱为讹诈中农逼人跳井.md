(From Our Correspondent) To carry out the Rectification Campaign and Democratic Supplement Movement, the Yongnian County Committee formed an investigation team to investigate Yulin Village in the Fourth District and create experience to promote the movement throughout the county. Below are some of the problems they researched and the initial work situation:

The village currently has 570 households (including more than 100 households that split after the May Fourth Instruction), 1,321 people, and 50 acres of land. The elimination of feudalism is extremely incomplete, and they still control the village's political power. The village's Poor Peasants' Group was formed before the Lunar New Year under the leadership of District Cadre Comrade Zhao Xiuwen. Village Head Wen Tingbian (who had been a quartermaster in the old army) and Village Secretary Wen Qinghuai took the opportunity to infiltrate and seize control. They convened a mass meeting and asked the masses, "Is it okay to call Zhao Wanyuan the director of the Poor Peasants' Group?" Everyone echoed, "Agreed!" Then they appointed Wang Yipei, Wen Guiran, and four others as group leaders, with Wen Qinghuai concurrently serving as the secretary of the Poor Peasants' Group. The Poor Peasants' Group was thus established. Wen Qinghuai himself served in the puppet army for three years. His family of three has more than ten acres of good paddy fields and does not work. Director Zhao Wanyuan had been a puppet soldier and enemy intelligence agent for several years. Wen Guiran is a rich middle peasant and a gambler. The members of the Poor Peasants' Group are also full of variety. For example, Zhao Longgui had 90 acres of land a few years ago, kept two long-term laborers, and now still has 20 acres of good paddy fields for a family of three. Wang Zao has a donkey and a waterwheel, and 30 acres of good paddy fields. This is just a preliminary understanding in four or five days, but it can also be seen the degree of impurity within.

After the establishment of the Poor Peasants' Group, because the Lunar New Year was approaching, some poor peasants had difficulty living. A few cadres of the Poor Peasants' Group took the opportunity to solve the problem of the poor's New Year life and took the opportunity to run amok. First, group leader Wen Guiran defrauded middle peasant Wen Hegui, saying, "If you give us four group leaders 40,000 yuan, the director will get more, and we won't fight you." This person only gave 10,000 yuan. He also defrauded poor peasant Jiang Changzhi of 5,000 yuan and the deaf-mute mother of 20 catties of wheat, and middle peasant Jiang Fa of 5,000 yuan. This is just what he did alone; there are many other things like this. Second, before the New Year, there were several fortune-tellers in the village, and they were fined indiscriminately. Among them was poor peasant Jie Taizhi, with a family of six or seven and four or five acres of land, who was fined more than 100,000 yuan. The director led the way to detain middle peasant Zhao Shengzhu, beat him, and fined him 280,000 yuan (they announced it as 240,000 yuan). The person was forced to jump into a well. After being rescued, he became half-mad and has not recovered yet. In addition, middle peasants Wang Shaogen, Wang Shengzhi, and others were fined, totaling more than a dozen households. Third, when they assessed and distributed the fruits of the struggle, Secretary Wen Qinghuai and Director Zhao Wanyuan held pens and paper to assess household by household. Regardless of wealth or poverty, anyone who did not have contact with their cadres could not share anything. For example, Gao Xiangui had a family of three, newly allocated three acres of land, worked as a long-term laborer from the age of fourteen, and is now over fifty years old. Because his family sold thread and bought two liters of rice and four dou of corn cobs, it was assessed that he could not share; but middle peasant Liu Qingsi, whose family had half a dou of white flour, had already steamed the white steamed buns for the New Year, and had three or four bags of grain, shared things because he had contact with them, which the masses were extremely dissatisfied with.

     Deeply Mobilize Poor and Hired Peasants to Cultivate True Backbones

I. Use the method of visiting the worthy to discover the backbone of poor peasants and understand the situation. (1) First, determine the approaching objects from the quality of the houses, food, clothing. Then, use the method of helping the masses to produce and work, to approach them, and conduct conversations and talks. At the beginning, the conversation started from the side, slowly talking about the family situation and the situation of turning over. From continuous conversations, we discovered and understood the thoughts and feelings of the poor and hired peasants and some situations in the village. (2) Review the backbone of the poor peasants' election, conduct multi-faceted understanding of the discovered poor and hired peasants, and the cadres promptly connect and research, keep the good ones, and examine the bad ones again. After multiple detailed mass and cadre reviews, elect the best ones as the backbone. After discovering the backbone, strengthen their class education so that they can secretly connect poor peasants and isolate a few bad people. After we grasped some backbones, we made a public appeal.

II. According to the village's situation and the requirements of the poor and hired peasants, five meetings were held successively: (1) Villagers' Congress: In addition to publicizing the Outline Land Law, it exposed some rumors: such as "Great Communism," "Great Sharing," "Great Reversal," "Expanding the Army," "Fighting Village Cadres," "Middle peasants will also be fought this time," etc., emphasizing the policy of uniting middle peasants, encouraging production, and suppressing evil spirits. (2) Branch Meeting: Educate party members to actively support the Outline Land Law, obey the poor and hired peasants, serve as long-term laborers for the masses, examine and reflect on their mistakes, comrades with mistakes should prepare to admit their mistakes to the masses, return the fruit that was occupied, and prohibit them from holding private meetings. After the meeting, some party members were more honest than before. (3) Village Cadre Meeting: Explain the Outline Land Law, educate them to implement it seriously, obey the poor and hired peasants, and not destroy it. Those with mistakes should admit their mistakes to the masses, and the masses will forgive them. Arrange for them to publicize the Outline Land Law, lead the masses to produce, urge landlords and rich peasants not to leave land uncultivated, and do a good job of preferential treatment for resistance against America, and not to leave the land of poor and anti-American families uncultivated. After the meeting, the village cadres' emotions were relatively stable. (4) Poor and hired peasants' congress: Strengthen class education, call on poor and hired peasants to organize and unite middle peasants to be masters of their own affairs, announce the conditions for participating in the Poor Peasants' Association, and those who do not meet the conditions will join the Peasants' Association later. Finally, announce the dissolution of the old Poor Peasants' Group and reorganize the new Poor Peasants' Association. After the meeting, the honest poor peasants were in high spirits. They said, "It's still good to promote good people. Bad guys who sink to the bottom still can't eat." They immediately carried out connections and were in high spirits. (5) Poor Peasants' Backbone Meeting: Educate them to stand firm, work for the emancipation of the entire poor and hired peasants, not to be fooled by landlords, and to be lured by landlords. And put forward the conditions of the Poor Peasants' Association and discuss with everyone. Poor peasant Zheng Shun said: "The roots must be planted correctly at the beginning. It won't work if they are not planted correctly. If the roots are planted correctly, the treetops above don't matter. Even if they shake a little, the roots can't be pulled..." After he spoke, everyone agreed and carried out public connections with high enthusiasm.

      永年榆林村经过深入调查　着手建立新贫农团
     假贫农组胡作乱为讹诈中农逼人跳井
    【本报消息】永年县委为开展整党、民主填补运动，特组调查组，到四区榆林村调查，并创造经验，推动全县运动。下面是他们调查研究出的一些问题和初步工作的情况：
    该村现有五百七十户（包括五四指示后分家的有百余户），一千三百二十一口人，五十顷地，封建消灭极不彻底，他们还掌握村政大权。该村贫农组是旧历年前区干赵修文同志领导组成的，掌握全村大权的村长温廷边（当过旧军队的军需官）和村书记温清怀二人乘机钻进掌握，他们召开群众大会，问群众“叫赵万元当贫农主任行不行？”大家随声都说“同意！”随又指定王一佩、温贵然等四人为大组长，温清怀兼贫农组书记。贫农组算成立了。温清怀本人当过三年伪军，他家三口人，有十余亩好水地，不干活。主任赵万元过去当过伪军和敌人情报员好几年，温贵然是个富中农，还好赌博。贫农组员里也是花样百出，如赵龙贵前几年有九十亩地，留两个长工，现还有好水地二十亩，三口人。王造有一个驴、一个水车，有好水地三十亩。这只是在四五天工夫中的初步了解，但也可看到内部不纯的程度。
    该贫农组成立后，因快到过旧历年，有些贫苦农民过年生活困难，少数贫农组干部就借口为穷人解决过年生活问题，趁机横行胡干起来。第一、大组长温贵然诈中农温何贵说：“你拿四万元我们四大组长分分，主任还得另外，就能不斗你。”这人只拿了一万元。还诈贫农江长只五千元和哑叭娘的二十斤麦子，中农江发只五千元。这只是他一个人作的，其他还有好些这样的事情。第二、年前这村有几家卖卦的，他们就乱罚起来，其中有贫农解太只，六七口人，四五亩地，罚了十万余元。主任领着头把中农赵生柱扣起来，打了一顿，罚了二十八万元（他们公布的是二十四万元），该人被逼跳井，被救出来后，气成半疯，现在还没有好。另外还罚有中农王少根、王胜只等，共罚了十余户。第三、当他们评议分果实时，书记温清怀和主任赵万元二人拿着笔和纸按户评议，他不管贫富，只要与他们干部没联系的就不能分东西。如高贤贵有三口人，新分三亩地，从十四岁当长工，现在五十余岁，因家卖线买了二升米，和四斗棒子穗，评议不能分；但中农刘清丝，家有白面半斗，把过年的白馍已蒸好了，还有三四布袋粮食，因与他们有联系，便分了东西，群众极为不满。
     深入发动贫雇培养真正骨干
    一、用访贤的方式，发现贫农骨干，了解情况。（一）先从每户的房屋、饭食、穿戴的好坏上，确定为接近的对象。再用帮助群众生产干活的方式，去接近他们，进行说话谈心。开始说话都是从侧面谈起，慢慢谈到家庭的情况与翻身的情形。从不断的接谈中，发现和了解贫雇的思想心情和村中的一些情况。（二）审查贫农选举骨干，将所发现的贫雇，进行多方面的了解，干部及时的接头研究，好则留，坏的再考查，经过多次详细的群众和干部审查，选举其中最好的作为骨干。发现骨干后，加强其阶级教育，使其暗中串连贫农，孤立少数坏人。我们掌握住一些骨干后，接着就作了公开的号召。
    二、根据该村的情况及贫雇的要求，先后召开了五个会议：（一）村民大会：除宣传土地法大纲外，并揭发一些谣言：如“大共产”“大伙堆”，“大颠换”，“要扩军”，“斗争村干”，“中农这次也得斗”等等，强调了团结中农的政策，鼓励了生产，镇压了邪气。（二）支部会：教育党员积极拥护土地法大纲，服从贫雇，为群众当长工，检查反省自己的错误，有错误的同志准备向群众承认错误，多占果实的要退还，并禁止他们私自开会。会后一些党员比以前老实了。（三）村干会：讲解土地法大纲，教育其认真执行，服从贫雇不得破坏，有错误向群众承认，群众会原谅的。布置他们宣传土地法大纲，领导群众生产，督促地主、富农不要荒地，和作好优抗，不要荒了贫抗属的土地，会后村干的情绪比较稳定了。（四）贫雇农大会：加强阶级教育，号召贫雇组织起来团结中农当家，宣布参加贫农团的条件，不合条件的，以后参加农会。最后宣布旧贫农组解散，重新组织新贫农团。会后老实贫农情绪很高，他们说：“还是兴好人，坏蛋沉底还是吃不开。”回去马上即进行串连。（五）贫农骨干会：教育其站稳立场，为整个贫雇翻身而干，不要上地主的当，受地主拉拢。并提出贫农团条件和大家商量，贫农郑顺的说：“开头扎根要扎正，扎不正可不行，树根扎正了，上边树梢就不要紧了，即便他有点摇摆，也拉不动根……。”他谈了后，大家都很赞成，就进行公开的串连，情绪很高涨。
