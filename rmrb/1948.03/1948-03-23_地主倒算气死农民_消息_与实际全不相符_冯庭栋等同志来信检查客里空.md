　　"Landlord Retaliation Angers Peasants, Leading to Death" News Completely Inaccurate

Comrades Editors of "Keli Kong":

　　The two manuscripts we previously wrote regarding the landlord retaliation in Xihui, Pingding (see the first page of this newspaper on February 20th) and the slaughter of livestock in Nanguan (December 12th, first page), were later found to be inconsistent with the actual situation after investigation. The actual situation is as follows: 1. Qi Sini (erroneously written as a landlord surnamed Ye), a middle peasant in Xihui, is related to Zhao Wentang (an old middle peasant) of Zhao Family Village (mistakenly heard as Zhao Qiantang, and because he distributed fruit, he was mistakenly understood to be a new middle peasant). Qi Sini is Zhao Wentang's nephew-in-law. Before the incident, he was repairing a kiln in Zhao Wentang's home, and Zhao lent Qi Sini 12 silver dollars, which were converted into two dan of millet at the time, saying that he would repay the millet in the future. It was not until half a month before the lunar New Year last year that he asked Zhao Wentang for it. At this time, Zhao was sick and immediately gave one dan, and it was agreed that the remaining one dan would be returned after the wheat harvest. As for the borrowed plow, it was borrowed and had nothing to do with the money. This matter was indeed resolved through mutual consultation. However, after January, Zhao Wentang became a little angry after repaying the debt, and his illness turned into typhus, eventually leading to his death. Although repaying the debt was not the main reason, it was somewhat related.

　　This material was originally told to the office by comrades Zhang Xiao and Wang Yilou, two district cadres from the Eighth District. The source was a report from district cadres Shi Xi and Zhao Zilin, who were working in Zhao Family Village, during a meeting in the district. Zhang Xiao and Wang Yilou mistakenly heard Qi Sini as being surnamed Ye, and when they heard district cadre Geng Ertu say that the surname Ye had been struggled against, they subjectively believed that those who had been struggled against were landlords. They also mistakenly heard Zhao Wentang, who died of anger, as Zhao Qiantang (because his father was called Zhao Qiantang). At the district meeting on January 27th, the original report stated that it was understood two or three days before, but they mistakenly heard it as happening two days before, so it was written as happening after the promulgation of the Land Law. The 12 yuan was originally a loan for repairing the kiln, but it was mistakenly heard as wages for repairing the kiln. The district cadres believed that since Qi Sini was a household that had been struggled against, they subjectively believed that this was an act of retaliation. We committed bureaucratism, and did not research and consider it when writing the manuscript. We only thought it was a new problem and needed to expose the crimes of the landlords, thus creating a complete "Keli Kong." We are conducting ideological self-criticism and are asking the district cadres to also conduct self-criticism.

　　2. In the manuscript about the slaughter of livestock in Nanguan, it was originally written that there were 114 productive donkeys. In fact, within the 149 cattle and donkeys, there were 114 donkeys, but not all of them were productive. This was a mistake we made. After a detailed investigation, out of the 149 cattle and donkeys, about 40 were disabled, and there were a few productive ones among them. The main culprits have now been detained and dealt with. (Tingdong, Jiyuan, Xiufeng, Zhengguo, Panlin)

　　Comrades Tingdong, Jiyuan, and others have honestly reviewed the "Keli Kong" they caused because they did not conduct serious investigations and interviews, but only listened to reports. This spirit is very good. Every one of our correspondents and manuscript writers must be truthful when writing news, and write with a spirit of responsibility to the Party newspaper and the people. We must not rely solely on hearsay to avoid making mistakes and harming our work.

　　“地主倒算气死农民”消息　与实际全不相符
     冯庭栋等同志来信检查客里空编辑同志：
    我们前写的平定西会地主倒算（见二月二十日本报一版）及南关杀牲畜问题（十二月十二日一版）两稿，后经调查与实际不相符，实际情况是这样：一、西会中农齐四妮（误写为姓叶地主）跟赵家庄赵文堂（旧中农）是亲戚关系（误听为赵千堂，因他分过果实，误解为新中农），齐四妮是赵文堂的外甥女婿，事变前在赵文堂家中修窑，赵借齐四妮大洋十二元，当时并折成小米两石，说将来还米，直至去年阳历年前半个月才向赵文堂讨要，此时赵正害病，立即给了一石，下余一石商定麦秋后归还。至于背走的一张耕犁，是借走的，与借钱无关，这件事确是双方商量解决的。但在一月以后，赵文堂因还债后着些气，就变病症为咯喽伤寒，终于病故，还债虽不是主要原因，但也有些关系的。
    这个材料，原是八区区干部张效、王义楼两同志来办公室说的。来源是在区开会的时候，由住赵家庄村工作的区干史喜、赵子林汇报的，张效、王义楼把齐四妮误听成姓叶的，又听区干耿二秃说姓叶已斗，他们主观认为已斗就是地主，并把气死的赵文堂误听成赵千堂（因他父叫赵千堂）。一月二十七日区开会，原报告是前两三天了解的，误听成前两天发生的事，因此写成土地法公布后发生的。十二元钱，原系修窑借款，误听为修窑工资。区干认为齐四妮既是被斗户，主观认为这是倒算行为。我们是犯了官僚主义的，在写稿时未加研究考虑，只认为是新问题，需要揭发地主罪恶，因而造成全部客里空。我们正作思想检查，让区干部也作检讨。
    二、南关杀牲畜一稿，原写能生产的驴一一四个，是一四九个牛驴内有驴一一四个，并不都是能生产的。这是我们写错的。经过详细调查，一四九个牛驴内，有四十来个残废，里边有几个能生产的，现已将主犯扣押处理。（庭栋、计元、秀峰、正国、盘林）
    庭栋、计元等同志，很老实的检查了他们因没认真调查访问只听汇报所造成的“客里空”，这种精神是很好的。我们每个通讯员和写稿的同志，写新闻一定要真实，以对党报对人民负责的精神来写，不能只凭道听途说，以免发生错误，贻害工作。
