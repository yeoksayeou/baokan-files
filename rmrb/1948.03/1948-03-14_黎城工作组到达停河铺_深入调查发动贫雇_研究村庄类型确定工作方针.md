Licheng Work Group Arrives at Tinghepu
　　Conducts In-Depth Investigation and Mobilizes Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers
    Studies Village Types to Determine Working Principles
    [Licheng News] The county work group, totaling twelve people, arrived at Tinghepu Village on the 28th of last month. They are investigating and studying to understand the situation, while also individually visiting poor peasants and hired laborers. The initial understanding and practices within the past six or seven days are introduced as follows:
    During the rent reduction and debt clearing movement in 1942, poor peasants and hired laborers in Tinghepu Village only attended meetings and lost work time without gaining any benefits. In the 1944 movement, poor peasants and hired laborers began to obtain some land, but fundamentally did not achieve emancipation. After the land reform in 1946, the land issue was basically resolved. However, upon checking the quantity and quality, some poor peasants and hired laborers were still not satisfied. The village's situation will be discussed from the following two aspects:
    I. From the perspective of peasant emancipation, the first thing to consider is land, housing, and livestock. 74.79% of the poor peasant and hired laborer class have had their land demands met, while 25.11% lack land. The village has a total of 3,745 mu of land, averaging 4.9 mu per person, producing 5,683 shi of grain, averaging 7.4 dou per person. Among the 69 poor peasant and hired laborer households, 28 households have an average of 3.98 mu of land per person, producing 5.92 dou of grain, below the village average. 34 households have an average of 5.4 mu of land per person, producing 8.5 dou of grain, meeting the village average. 7 households have an average of 6 mu of land per person, producing 10.3 shi of grain, exceeding the village average. 28 households have no livestock (mostly one per household), two households have no housing (two old men), and eight households still live in dilapidated houses. Secondly, the improvement in floating wealth is even worse, with only over 60% of this class having their demands met.
    II. Branch situation: The village has 33 party members, but the leadership is controlled by middle peasants, influenced by landlord and rich peasant ideology, with various problems: 1. Shielding individual landlords. 2. Being selfish and seizing more of the masses' gains, with four or five being very serious. 3. Engaging in affairs with women, with two or three being serious, and the leadership style is administrative command.
    We began to intervene to understand the situation: 1. From the burden accounts, we understood the land, population, and livestock. Based on our research, the burden accounts are accurate (referring to Licheng) and can be used as the basis for understanding the land and livestock owned by each class. Based on the burden accounts, our work group, in coordination with three or four poor peasants and hired laborers, initially classified the classes. 2. We learned from the poor peasants and hired laborers. In visiting them during their emancipation, we can connect it to cadres seizing gains and the incomplete elimination of feudalism, etc. 3. For necessary materials that poor peasants and hired laborers cannot find, we can talk to individual better cadres and party members.
    While understanding the situation, the work group directly conducted in-depth visits with poor peasants and hired laborers, seeking out honest peasants who have been working for a long time. Initially, we found six or seven people. They were initially afraid to tell our work group their true thoughts, fearing that we were not reliable, and not knowing whether raising issues would lead to a good outcome or not. The work group then clarified their attitude in individual visits and group meetings with poor peasants and hired laborers. We told them that cadres who seized gains would definitely return them and that we would guarantee that the demands of the poor peasants and hired laborers would be met.
    After repeated ideological mobilization, relying on them as the backbone to then connect with and mobilize other poor peasants and hired laborers, they began to awaken, daring to raise opinions to cadres. We then convened a village-wide peasant meeting, where Comrade Liu Jianfu, the county secretary, made a self-criticism on behalf of the party, informed the peasants of the spirit of the Land Law Outline, then made all party members public, called on the poor peasants and hired laborers to boldly raise opinions to the party members, and finally pointed out to all party members that they should honestly bow their heads to the peasants and admit their mistakes. After specific analysis of the situation, it was decided that the village is a Class Two village. The current second-stage policy is determined to be to boldly mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers to organize poor peasant leagues. Expose the impurity of the branch, convene meetings of male and female peasants, and widely publicize the Land Law Outline.

　　黎城工作组到达停河铺
  　深入调查发动贫雇
    研究村庄类型确定工作方针
    【黎城消息】县工作组共十二人，于上月二十八号到达停河铺村，一面调查研究了解情况，同时个别访问贫雇，今将六、七日内初步了解及做法介绍如下：
    停河铺在四二年减租清债运动时，贫雇农只有开会误工，没有得到果实。四四年运动，贫雇农才开始得到了一些土地，但基本上没有翻身。经过了四六年土改，土地问题才基本得到解决。但从数量上质量上检查，还有一部贫雇没有满足。现从下面两方面来谈该村情况：
    一、从农民翻身上看，首先看土地房屋牲口。贫雇阶层已有百分之七四·七九满足了土地要求，有百分之二十五·一一缺少土地。全村总共地三千七百四十五亩，每口平均四亩九。产粮五千六百八十三石，每人平均七石四斗。六十九户贫雇农，有二十八户每口平均三亩九分八，产粮五石九斗二，低于全村水平。三十四户每口平均五亩四分地，产粮八石五斗，合乎全村水平。七户每口平均六亩，产粮十石三，超过全村水平。二十八户没有牲口（大部是一户一口），两户没有房住（两个老汉），八户仍住着坏房。其次浮财上翻的比较更差些，占本阶层百分之六十强，没有满足了要求。
    二、支部情况：全村三十三个党员，但领导上是中农掌权，受了地富思想的影响，有各种毛病：一、包庇个别地主。二、自私自利，多占群众果实，其中四五个很严重。三、搞女人，严重者有二、三个，领导作风是行政命令。
    我们开始插手了解情况：一、是从负担帐上来了解土地人口牲口。根据我们研究结果，负担帐是确实的（指黎城），可作为我们了解各阶层占有土地牲口的依据。根据负担帐，咱们工作组配合三、四个贫雇农，初步的把阶层划分了一下。二、是从贫雇农中了解。在访他的翻身中，可以连系出干部多占果实封建消灭不彻底等情况。三、必要的材料，贫雇农摸不着，可找个别较好的干部党员谈谈。
    在了解情况同时，工作组直接深入访问贫雇，找真正常年劳动的老实农民。开始找到了六、七人，他们开始对我们工作组不敢说心思话，怕我们不可靠，提出来也不知翻好翻不好等思想。工作组便在个别访问贫雇农小组会上，向贫雇表明自己态度。告给他们干部多占果实，一定退出来，保证满足贫雇要求。
    经过反复的思想发动，依他们为骨干再去串通发动贫雇，他们开始觉悟，敢向干部提意见了，便召开全村农民大会，由县书刘健夫同志代表党作了自我检讨，把土地法大纲的精神告给了农民，然后把全体党员公开，号召贫雇大胆的向党员提意见，最后给全体党员指出，应老老实实向农民低头承认错误。经过具体分析情况，决定该村是二类村。现确定第二期的方针，放手发动贫雇组织贫雇，成立贫农团。揭发支部不纯，召开男女农民大会，普遍宣传土地法大纲。
