Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Tokyo dispatch: According to reliable sources, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army and commander-in-chief of ground forces stationed in Japan, has secretly notified companies with direct interests that 125 Japanese factories and plants originally included in the reparations plan have now been secretly decided by MacArthur to be exempt from dismantling for reparations purposes; and ordered them to be refitted and secretly incorporated into production enterprises. This is another important step by the United States in supporting the revival of Japanese militarism in the industrial field. Earlier this year, after the Japanese cabinet, on MacArthur's orders, removed the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda Zaibatsu from the scope of the Economic Decentralization Law, MacArthur Headquarters also removed 83 factories from the reparations list. The latter news was published by the Japan Times. Now, another 125 factories have had their reparations status canceled. It is reported that among these factories whose reparations status has been canceled are 20 joint manufacturing plants of the Hino Industrial Company, which was responsible for manufacturing tanks during the war, and 45 other enterprises, including large-scale aircraft manufacturing plants formerly belonging to the Nakajima Corporation. Brigadier General McWatter, chief of the Science and Economics Group of the U.S. Occupation Forces General Staff in Japan, is drafting a manufacturing plan for the factories, including the time required to incorporate these 125 factories into the production enterprise sector; and the companies concerned are drafting technical plans for refitting based on standards exceeding wartime production by two times. The financial assistance and technical guidance required for the refitting will be provided and supervised by the United States; for this purpose, the U.S. government will provide Japan with special loans. Because the MacArthur General Staff fears criticism from domestic and international public opinion in the United States, it has requested the Japanese government to keep this illegal measure absolutely secret and has obtained the consent of the Japanese government. But as the saying goes, "If you don't want others to know, don't do it in the first place." This so-called "secret" is now known to many people.

　　美帝积极扶植日本侵略势力
    【新华社陕北五日电】东京讯：据可靠方面透露，美国第八军军长，驻日地面部队总司令艾契堡中将，已秘密向有直接利益关系的公司通知：原被列入赔偿计划的一百二十五个日本制造厂和工厂，现已由麦克阿瑟秘密决定，免予拆卸作赔偿之用；并令其改装后，暗中并入生产企业。这是美国在工业方面扶植日本军国主义复活的又一重要步骤，按今年年初，日本内阁曾奉麦克阿瑟之命，将三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀自经济分散法范围内抽出以后，麦克阿瑟总部又将八十三家工厂自赔偿名单中勾消。后一消息，曾由日本时报发表，现在取消赔偿的工厂，又有一百二十五家。据悉：这批被取消赔偿的工厂中，有在战时担任制造坦克的日野产业公司的二十个联合制造厂，与其他四十五个企业，其中包括前属中岛公司的大规模飞机制造厂等。驻日美团占领军参谋部科学经济组组长麦克瓦特准将，正在拟订工厂的制造计划，并包括将这一百二十五家工厂，并入进行生产企业部门中所需的时间；而有关各公司，则正在根据超过战时生产量两倍的标准，拟订改装的技术方案。改装所需的财政援助和技术指导，都将由美国供给和督率；为此，美国政府将给与日本以专门的贷款。麦克阿瑟参谋部因畏惧美国国内与国际舆论的责难，故要求日本政府对此项违法措施，保守绝对秘密，并已取得日本政府的同意。可是正如俗话说的：“若要人不知，除非己莫为”，这种所谓“秘密”，现已被许多人知道了。
