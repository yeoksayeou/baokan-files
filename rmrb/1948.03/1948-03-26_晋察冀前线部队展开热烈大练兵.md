Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th: The frontline troops of the People's Liberation Army are enthusiastically engaged in training, striving to annihilate a large number of enemies in the spring offensive. When mobilizing troops for training, military and political cadres in various units mostly used branches, squads, platoons, and mutual aid groups to deeply discuss questions such as "how to train soldiers well in a short period of time." They ideologically enlightened the soldiers' understanding of training. Cadres also set an example by going deep into the lower levels and training with the soldiers. Company-level cadres participated in squad meetings, personally assisting the squad leaders' work and patiently helping soldiers correct their movements. Some company cadres who did not know how to bayonet humbly asked soldiers to be their teachers.

The Third Company of a certain unit, based on the actual situation, set out the key points of training. After reviewing the shortcomings of combat, the company decided that cadres should train in command, soldiers should train in formations, how to use terrain and terrain features, and machine guns should train in covering infantry assaults. A certain unit proposed "each trains what is needed." Some soldiers only knew the essentials of shooting but were not accurate in aiming, so their focus was on aiming. Stretcher-bearers practiced rescuing the wounded in various combat situations.

During the training campaign, cadres and soldiers who diligently trained and studied hard significantly improved their skills. Zhao Jiang, a new soldier from a certain unit, after diligently training and studying and constantly researching live ammunition shooting, scored 25 rings with three shots during target practice. Liberated soldiers, after undergoing grievance-airing education, improved their class consciousness and trained very enthusiastically. Many of the liberated soldiers were from Chahar, and they generally resolved to "learn their skills, fight back to their hometowns, and eliminate Fu Zuoyi."
