Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Prague dispatch: The new Gottwald cabinet was formally sworn in on the 27th of last month. In his address to the President, Gottwald stated: "Your merit lies in attentively listening to the voices of our people and recognizing the legitimacy of their demands and anger. I believe that the National Constituent Assembly will approve this government and its program of action. We firmly refute the slanders of certain foreigners who say that our freedom and parliamentary democracy are in danger. But those Munich criminals who shed our blood with their conspiracies, the scoundrels who colluded with Hitler's Germany, that batch of the most undemocratic and illegal fellows, they are not qualified to talk about democracy with us! We can proudly assert that we have once again legitimately demonstrated our truly thorough democracy and our loyalty to people's democracy." On the 28th, the National Congress of Farmers' Associations was held in Prague, attended by thousands of farmer representatives from various regions. Gottwald personally attended the congress and delivered a speech, stating: "The establishment of the new democratic government is of great significance to the farmers. The conspirators attempted to return the land distributed to the farmers to the landlords. They wanted to prevent the passage and implementation of the new land reform law. But the new government will not hesitate to pass and implement the new land reform law, private land must not exceed 50 hectares. We demand the passage of a new constitution stipulating 'land to the tiller'!" Gottwald's speech was finally drowned out by the storm of cheers from the congress.

　　捷克举行农代大会
  　新政府将实行新土地改革法
    【新华社陕北二日电】布拉格讯：哥特瓦尔德新内阁已于上月二十七日正式宣誓就职，哥氏在向总统致辞时称：“你的功绩在于注意倾听了我国人民的呼声，并认识了他们的要求和愤怒的正当性。我相信国民制宪会议将批准本政府及其施政纲领，我们坚决驳斥某些外国人士的谰言，他们说我国的自由与议会民主受到了危险，但这些曾使我们为他们的阴谋流了血的慕尼黑的罪犯，与希特勒德国狼狈为奸的恶棍，那批态度最不民主和非法的家伙，他们不配跟我们讲民主！我们可以自豪地断言，我们又一次正当的表示了我国真正彻底的民主和我们对人民民主的忠实。”廿八日，农民协会全国代表大会在布拉格召开，到各地农民代表数千人，哥特瓦尔德亲赴大会发表演说称：“新民主政府的成立，对农民具有重大意义，阴谋分子企图把分配给农民的土地交还给地主，他们想阻止新土地改革法的通过施行，但新政府将毫不迟疑的通过实行新土地改革法，私有土地不得超过五十公顷以上，我们要求通过一部规定‘耕者有其田’的新宪法！”哥氏的演说，最后为大会暴风雨似的欢呼所淹没。
