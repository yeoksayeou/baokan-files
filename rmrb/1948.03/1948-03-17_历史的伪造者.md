  　Part Three: The Isolation of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact.
    After fascist Germany seized Czechoslovakia, it openly carried out its war preparations. Humanity was getting closer and closer to an unparalleled war disaster. But the fact proves that even in the critical period of the impending war in the spring and summer of 1939, Britain and France, with the support of the United States, continued their past line—instigating Hitler's Germany against the Soviet Union. In order to deceive public opinion, they played some stupid diplomatic conspiracies, one of which was the decision of Britain and France in 1939 to negotiate with the Soviet Union. Subsequent developments proved that Britain and France were playing a double game, and Germany knew this at the time. For example, German Ambassador to the UK, Dirkson, reported to the German Foreign Ministry on August 3, 1939, stating: "The general impression here is that Britain's contact with other countries in recent months is only a preparation for seeking a real reconciliation with Germany. Once an agreement is reached with Germany, this contact will cease.” The falsifiers of history want to try their best to hide these documents, because these documents will reveal the true history of the war.
    The negotiations between Britain and France and the Soviet Union began in March 1939 and continued for about four months. During the negotiations, in response to British questions, the Soviet Union proposed convening a conference of representatives from Britain, France, Romania, Poland, Turkey, and the Soviet Union to determine the attitude of all participating countries. Britain disagreed, but on March 21, it suggested that the four countries, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and Poland, sign a declaration. During the discussion, the British ambassador particularly emphasized that the wording of the declaration should not involve any constraints. Obviously, this kind of declaration could not become an effective weapon against the aggressor. However, the Soviet government believed that although the promises in the declaration were few, it was at least a step forward in stopping aggression, so it agreed to the British proposal. But on April 1, the British ambassador informed the Soviet government that Britain believed that the issue of a joint declaration had become a thing of the past. Two weeks later, British Foreign Secretary Halifax suggested to the Soviet government that the Soviet Union should state in the declaration: "Once any of the Soviet Union's European neighbors is attacked, and that country rises up to resist, the Soviet government can provide assistance if that country is willing." That is to say, once Germany invaded Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the Soviet Union was obliged to provide assistance, but Britain had no obligation. This would make the Soviet Union alone involved in the war against Germany. In order not to give up any opportunity to conclude an agreement to resist the aggressor, the Soviet Union immediately put forward its counterproposal to Britain, the main points of which were: (1) If any of the three countries, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, is attacked, other countries should immediately provide assistance, including military assistance; (2) If any of the Eastern European countries from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and adjacent to the Soviet Union is attacked, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France should provide various assistance, including military assistance; (3) The Soviet Union, Britain, and France should decide in a short period of time the quantity and form of assistance that should be provided to these countries in the above situations. It is not difficult to see that the Soviet proposal was fundamentally different from that of Britain. The Soviet proposal provided an effective way to jointly resist aggression. But the British government did not respond for three weeks. In order to deceive public opinion, Britain sent a reply on May 8, in which it once again asked the Soviet Union to bear unilateral obligations, while Britain and France had no obligations to the Soviet Union regarding the Baltic countries. It is easy to see that Britain's suggestion was directed more to Berlin than to Moscow—inviting Germany to attack the Soviet Union and letting Germany understand that as long as Germany launched an attack through the Baltic countries, Britain and France were willing to remain neutral, and the Soviet Union would be in the most unfavorable situation. The behavior of Britain and France at the Moscow meeting was so intolerable that Molotov had to inform the British and French envoys on May 27, 1939, that the negotiations showed that Britain and France were not seriously concerned about concluding a treaty with the Soviet Union, and that the need for negotiations by Britain and France was probably to achieve their own goals. The Soviet government had no intention of participating in such negotiations.
    The London Times unintentionally revealed the reason for the endless delay in the Moscow negotiations. The newspaper wrote: "Concluding a rigid and strict treaty with the Soviet Union would hinder other negotiations." The "other negotiations" referred to by the newspaper obviously referred to the negotiations between British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and Hitler's economic adviser Wohlthat. Regarding this point, everyone knows a lot from the newspapers. It is worth noting that Britain sent second-rate people to Moscow for negotiations, while Chamberlain himself flew to Germany several times to discuss with Hitler. The British representative Strang, who participated in the negotiations with the Soviet Union, did not even have the power to sign any agreement with the Soviet Union. Military negotiations were also fruitless. The British and French military delegations supported Poland's position of rejecting Soviet aid. When discussing the troop strength that countries could deploy to the battlefield, Britain stated that it was only willing to deploy five infantry divisions and one mechanized division to the battlefield, while the Soviet Union declared at the time that it was prepared to deploy 136 divisions, 5,000 medium and heavy artillery pieces, 10,000 tanks and armored vehicles, and more than 5,000 fighter jets to the front line to resist the aggressor. This shows how unserious Britain's attitude towards the negotiations was.
    The above facts fully prove the following conclusions: (1) Throughout the negotiations, the Soviet government always strived to sign a truly effective mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France on an equal footing; (2) Britain and France had no sincerity in the negotiations; (3) The perfidious purpose of Britain and France was to make Hitler understand that the Soviet Union had no allies and was isolated. It could attack the Soviet Union without risking resistance from Britain and France.
    As everyone knows, Britain conducted open negotiations with the Soviet Union on the one hand, and secret negotiations with Germany on the other. Western countries paid special attention to the latter and used the former as a means of paralyzing the vigilance of the masses in these countries. British Foreign Secretary Halifax said at a banquet of the Royal Institute of International Affairs on June 29, 1939, that he was willing to reach an agreement with Germany on all issues, including the issue of "living space." If we recall that Halifax's "Daily Mail" had suggested as early as 1933 that Hitler seize "living space" from the Soviet Union, then there is no doubt what Halifax meant. As early as June 1939, Britain secretly negotiated with Germany in London through Hitler's advisor Wohlthat. In July, the negotiations reopened. German Ambassador to the UK, Dirkson, pointed out in a report to the German Foreign Ministry on July 21 that the negotiations between Wohlthat and Wilson included various political, military, and economic issues, and in particular stipulated "the boundaries of the living space between Britain and Germany." Britain promised that after the treaty was signed, Germany would solve the Polish Corridor issue with Poland alone. Dirkson said: "So Poland was abandoned and met with Germany alone." From this, it can be seen that the ink on Britain's guarantee to Poland had not dried, and it was already prepared to let Hitler annex Poland.
    Under the policy of Britain and France of isolating the Soviet Union and directing the aggressor to the East, and with the assistance of American millionaires to Germany to expand its military industry and hoping to profit from the war, the Soviet Union had to make a choice: either accept Germany's proposal for a non-aggression pact in order to defend itself and better prepare its forces to resist a possible attack by the aggressor; or reject the proposal for a non-aggression pact, thereby allowing the war instigators in Western countries to immediately drag the Soviet Union into a war against Germany when the situation was very unfavorable to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union was completely isolated. The Soviet government was forced to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany. This choice was a wise and far-sighted action under the conditions at the time, and to a large extent predetermined the outcome of World War II in favor of the Soviet Union and all freedom-loving nations. It is a vile slander to insist that concluding an agreement with Hitler was part of the Soviet Union's foreign policy plan. Is it not a fact that the Soviet Union was the last of the major non-aggressor powers in Europe to conclude an agreement with Germany? The Soviet Union was good at using the Soviet-German agreement to strengthen its defenses and allow Hitler's eastward offensive to launch hundreds of kilometers further west. The Soviet Union did not fail in the war, but triumphed victoriously. The falsifiers of history and other reactionaries are certainly unhappy about these facts. But their unhappiness proves precisely that the Soviet Union's policy was, and still is, correct. (To be continued)

　　历史的伪造者
    苏联情报局
  　第三部分：苏联的孤立与苏德互不侵犯条约。
    法西斯德国在攫取捷克后，公开地进行其战争准备。人类一天天更接近于无可比拟的战争灾祸。但事实证明，甚至在一九三九年春夏两季战争迫近的危急时期，英法也在美国的支持下，继续其过去的路线--挑拨希特勒德国反苏。他们为了欺骗舆论，玩弄了某些愚蠢的外交阴谋，其中之一，就是一九三九年英法两国的决定与苏联谈判。以后的发展证明：英法是在耍两面手法，而德国当时也知道这点，例如：德驻英大使狄克逊三九年八月三日给德国外交部的报告中称：“此间一般印象是：英国近数月来与其他国家间的联系，仅是和德国求得真正和解的准备手段。一旦与德国的协议达成，这种联系就会停止。”历史伪造者想竭力隐藏这些文件，因为这些文件会使战争的真实历史大白于世。
    英法两国与苏联间的谈判，开始于三九年三月，继续进行约四个月。谈判过程中，苏联在答复英国问题时，提议召开英、法、罗、波、土与苏联六国代表会议，以确定一切与会国的态度。英国不同意，却于三月二十一日建议苏、英、法、波四国签署一个宣言。讨论中，英大使又特别强调宣言的措辞应不涉及任何约束。显然的，这种宣言不能成为抵抗侵略者的有效武器。然而苏联政府认为：宣言中的诺言虽很少，但至少是在制止侵略方面进了一步，因此同意英国的建议。但至四月一日，英大使通知苏联政府说：英国认为联合宣言问题已事过境迁。两星期后，英外长哈里法克斯向苏政府建议，苏联应在宣言上声述：“一旦苏联欧洲邻邦之任何一国遭受侵略，该国起而抵抗时，如果该国愿意，苏联政府可予以援助。”这就是说，德国一旦侵略爱、拉、立三国时，苏联有义务予以援助，而英国却没有任何义务。这就是使苏联单独卷入于对德战争中。苏联为了不放弃任何订立抵抗侵略者协定的机会，立即向英国提出其对案，要点为：（一）苏英法三国中如有一国遭受侵略，他国应立予援助，包括军事援助在内；（二）从波罗的海至黑海及与苏联毗邻的东欧国家中，如有一国遭受侵略，苏、英、法三国应予以各种援助，包括军事援助在内；（三）苏、英、法三国应在短期内决定在上述情形下，应予这些国家援助的数量和形式。不难看出，苏联建议与英国的有基本的不同。苏联建议提供了共同反抗侵略的有效办法。但英政府过了三星期未予答复。英国为了欺骗舆论，五月八日始送来复文，其中又一次要求苏联负担单方面的义务，而英、法关于波罗的海国家，却对苏联不负任何义务，很容易看出，英国的建议，与其说是给莫斯科的，实在还不如说是给柏林的--邀请德国进攻苏联，并使德国了解：只要德国经过波罗的海各国发动进攻，英法愿意保持中立，那时苏联将处于最不利的情况。英法在莫斯科会议中的行为，如此使人不能容忍，以致莫洛托夫不得不于三九年五月二十七日通知英法使节说：谈判表示：英法并不严肃关心与苏联缔结条约，英法之需要谈判，可能是为了达到他们自己的目的。苏联政府无意参加这种谈判。
    伦敦泰晤士报无意中泄露莫斯科谈判无止境拖延的原因。该报写道：“和苏联订立硬性而严格的条约，会妨碍其他谈判。”该报所指的“其他谈判”，显系指英海外贸易部长赫德逊与希特勒经济顾问乌尔塔特所进行的谈判。关于此点，大家从报纸上知道的很多。值得注意的是，英国把次等人物派来莫斯科谈判，而张伯伦本人则数度飞往德国和希特勒商谈。参加对苏谈判的英代表史特朗，甚至没有与苏联签订任何协议的权力。军事谈判同样没有结果。英法军事代表团支持波兰拒绝苏联援助的立场。当讨论各国可调至战场的兵力时，英国提出它只愿调出五个步兵师、一个机械化师至战场，而当时苏联却宣称它准备将一百三十六个师、五千门中型炮与重炮、一万辆坦克与装甲车、五千架以上的战斗机调往前线，以抵抗侵略者。这说明英国对谈判的态度如何的不严肃。
    上述事实，充分证明下列结论：（一）在整个谈判过程中，苏联政府始终力求与英法在平等基础上，签订真正有效的互助协定；（二）英法对谈判毫无诚意；（三）英法背信弃义的目的，是要使希特勒明了：苏联无盟国，是孤立的。它可以进攻苏联而不会冒遭遇英法两国抵抗的危险。
    尽人皆知，英国一方面对苏联进行公开谈判；同时又对德国进行秘密谈判。西方国家特别重视后者，并利用前者作为麻痹这些国家大众警惕性的手段。英外相哈里法克斯三九年六月二十九日在皇家国际问题协会的宴会说：他愿意在一切问题上与德国成立协议，包括“生存空间”问题。如果回亿一下哈氏的“每日邮报”，早在三三年就建议希特勒向苏联夺取“生存空间”时，那么哈氏的意思是什么，便毫无疑问了。英国早在三九年六月便经过希特勒的顾问乌尔塔特，在伦敦与德国秘密谈判，七月，谈判重开。德国驻英大使狄克逊七月二十一日致德外部的报告中指出：乌尔塔特与威尔逊的谈判，包括有政治、军事、经济的各种问题，其中特别规定了“英德两国间生存空间的界限”，英国允诺在条约签字后，让德国与波兰单独解决波兰走廊问题。狄克逊说：“于是波兰被遗弃并单独和德国相见。”由此可知，英国对波兰保证签字的墨迹未干，它已准备听任希特勒吞并波兰了。
    在英法奉行孤立苏联将侵略者导向东方的政策下，在美国百万富翁协助德国扩大军事工业；并希望从战争中渔利的情况下，苏联不得不有所抉择：或者为了自卫接受德国互不侵犯协定的建议，更好的准备力量以抵抗侵略者可能的进攻；或者拒绝互不侵犯协定的建议，从而使西方国家中的战争挑拨者在情况对苏联十分不利、苏联完全陷于孤立的时期，立即把苏联卷入对德战争中。苏联政府被迫与德国缔结了互不侵犯协定，这一选择在当时已有的条件下，是一个明智而有远见的行动，并在很大程度上预定了二次大战有利于苏联及一切爱好自由民族的结局。那种硬说和希特勒缔结协定是苏联外交政策计划的一部分，是一种下流的诽谤。在欧洲各非侵略大国中，苏联是最后才与德国缔结协定的，难道不是事实吗？苏联曾善于利用苏德协定来加强其防御，并使希特勒的向东攻势从更西数百公里以外发动。苏联在战争中并未失败，反而凯旋获胜。历史伪造者及其他反动派对于这些事实，当然是不高兴的。但他们的不高兴，恰恰证明苏联的政策曾经是而且仍然是正确的。（待三续）
