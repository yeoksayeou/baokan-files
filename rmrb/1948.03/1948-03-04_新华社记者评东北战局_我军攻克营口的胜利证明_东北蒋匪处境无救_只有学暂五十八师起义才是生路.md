Xinhua News Agency Northeast, 2nd. Our reporter reports: The Liberation Army's capture of Yingkou and the uprising of Chiang's 58th Provisional Division have choked off one of the so-called two supply ports in the Northeast that the US-Chiang clique frequently touted. The Liberation Army has completely controlled the entire Beining branch line from Goubangzi to Yingkou, as well as the entire area from the outskirts of Shenyang to southern Liaoning.

The military and political victory of the Liberation Army in Yingkou fully proves that Chiang's bandits in the Northeast have reached a point of no return. The uprising of Chiang's 58th Provisional Division was precisely prompted by this situation. In the powerful winter offensive of the Liberation Army, two full divisions of enemy troops in Gongzhuling and one division each in Zhangwu, Xinlitun, Liaoyang, Anshan, and Faku were annihilated one by one. Whether they fought, defended, or fled, they were annihilated. Therefore, the 58th Provisional Division, isolated in Yingkou, chose its own correct path—an armed uprising to return to the people. Their situation is precisely the same situation that all Chiang's troops in the Northeast are currently facing. Their weighing of the pros and cons, understanding of righteousness, and resolute and bright actions have pointed out a way out for all Chiang's troops today.

Introduction to Yingkou

Yingkou is located at the mouth of the Liao River and has branch lines connected to the Beining and China-Changchun Railways. It is an important trading port in southern Manchuria. In terms of industry, it has salt production, fishing, tobacco and tea, papermaking, and magnesium production, among which salt production accounts for the largest proportion, and fishery production is also very developed. There are two papermaking factories. In 1940, the only shipyard in the Northeast was established. After Japan surrendered, the port was once recovered by the Liberation Army. In early January 1946, it was invaded and occupied by Chiang's bandits. Later, we recovered it once again, and on April 2 of the same year, it was reoccupied by them. Since then, Chiang's bandits have used this port and Huludao as important maritime supply stations, and US imperialist warships have helped transport soldiers and ammunition. After being recovered by us this time, Chiang's bandits only have Huludao left as a maritime supply port in southern Manchuria.

　　新华社记者评东北战局
  　我军攻克营口的胜利证明
  　东北蒋匪处境无救
    只有学暂五十八师起义才是生路
    【新华社东北二日电】本社记者报导：解放军攻克营口和蒋军暂五十八师起义，这就捏死了美蒋经常喧嚷的所谓东北两个供应港之一，而解放军则完全控制了沟帮子到营口的北宁支线的全部，以及自沈阳外围直到辽南的整个地区。　　
    解放军在营口的军事上和政治的上胜利，充分证明了蒋匪在东北已到无可救药的地步，蒋军暂五十八师的起义，正是在这样情况下促成的，就是在解放军强大的冬季攻势中，公主屯敌军的两个整师和彰武、新立屯、辽阳、鞍山、法库的各一个师，都一一就歼，打也是被歼，守也是被歼，逃也是被歼，于是孤悬营口的暂五十八师就选择了自己的一条正确的道路——武装起义归向人民。他们这种处境正是目前东北所有蒋军同样面临的处境，他们这种权衡利害，深明大义，毅然决然的光明举动，已为今日所有一切蒋军指出一条生路。
  　营口介绍
    营口位于辽河入海处，北宁、中长两铁路都有支线通达。为南满一重要贸易港口。在工业方面有制盐、渔业、烟茶、制纸、制镁等，其中盐产占大宗，渔产亦极发达，制纸厂有两座。一九四○年并建立东北唯一的造船厂。日本投降后该港曾为解放军光复，一九四六年一月初被蒋匪侵占，后我又一度收复，同年四月二日再被其重占。以后蒋匪即以此港与葫芦岛作为重要的海上补给站，并由美帝国主义军舰帮助载运兵士及弹药等，此次被我收复后，蒋匪在南满之海上供应港口已仅剩葫芦岛一个。
