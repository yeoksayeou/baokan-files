Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 13th: Berlin dispatch: The German people are expressing anger at the communiqué issued by the US, British, and French London Conference, denouncing it as a "conspiracy to finally split Germany, destroy the peace treaty, and turn West Germany into a war industrial base and strategic base for US-British imperialism." West German Communist leader Reimann commented: The Three-Power Conference is a decisive action to split Germany. The control of the Ruhr is only to allow foreign capitalists to manipulate the Rhine and Ruhr industries, while German Conlaren will retain their economic status as agents of foreign monopoly capitalists. The Berlin Conference of the German Democratic Women's League passed a resolution protesting the London talks that "reduce Germany to a colony." The "Vowell" newspaper strongly stated: The German people, who have not been consulted, will absolutely not agree to the London resolutions. The "Daily Tribune" emphasized in an editorial that a split government has already been established in West Germany, pointing out: As a result of the Three-Power Conference, West Germany will serve as a pawn and base in the aggressive imperialist Western European bloc. Berlin News editor Kirkill wrote that the German people are unwilling to be dragged into an aggressive group in the slightest. Including West Germany in the Marshall Plan forces Germany to lose its own industry and take out its coal, coking coal, and steel to meet the requirements of self-seeking foreign capitalists. Western countries and corrupt German politicians must be held responsible for the division of Germany. The "New Times" strongly stated: The unity achieved by the Allies at the Potsdam Conference was finally destroyed at the London Conference. Placing the Ruhr under the control of Western countries will become a blood transfusion station for the Western bloc.

　　伦郭会议分裂德国全德人民无不愤怒
    【新华社陕北十三日电】柏林讯：德国人民对美、英、法伦敦会议所发表的公报，咸表愤怒，斥之为“最后分裂德国，破坏和约及将西德变为美英帝国主义的战争工业基地和战略基地的阴谋”。西德共产党领袖瑞曼评称：三国会议为分裂德国的具有决定性的行动。鲁尔的管制，只是使外国资本家来操纵莱茵与鲁尔工业，而德国康来仑将以外国垄断资本家代理人的资格，来保留他们的经济地位。德民主妇女联盟柏林会议决议，抗议“降德国为殖民地”的伦敦谈判。窝维尔报力称：未被征求意见的德国人民，将绝对不同意伦敦决议。每日论坛报在社论中强调分裂政府业已在西德成立，指出：三国会议的结果，西德将在侵略性的帝国主义西欧集团中，充当爪牙和基地。柏林新闻主编克基尔撰文称：德国人民丝毫不愿意被牵进侵略性的集团里。将西德包括到马歇尔计划里，使德国不得不丧失它自己的工业，并拿出它的煤，焦煤和钢，来适应图谋私利的外国资本家的要求。西方国家与腐朽的德国政客，都要对分裂德国负责。新时报力称：盟国在波茨顿会议上所达到的团结，已在伦敦会议上最后被破坏。鲁尔置于西方国家管制之下，将成为西方集团的输血库。
