　　The Hukuan Workers' Grain Shortage

Chen Hong's Letter of Explanation

Editor:

　　The People's Daily published on February 20th, on the first page, Comrade Gai Liangbi, of the Hukuan County Government's statement: The county "did not over-collect grain from workers on missions." The editor also asked what my February 1st "Criticisms and Suggestions" article was based on. Here is my reply:

　　We did indeed receive two notification documents from the Taihang Third Special District Office, No. 46 of the year, February 25th, (original attached) and the Changzhi Municipal Government, No. 2 of the year, December 19th, both with the same content, stating that according to the Taihang Administrative Office's regulations: roughly, from November of last year, workers on missions should pay their grain to the government where the factory is located, etc. ... The other day, I specifically visited the Taihang Third Special District Office. According to Secretary Liu, this type of notification is considered a formal order. However, it was only issued to directly subordinate factories. As for the counties, because the county finance and grain chiefs were holding a meeting at the time, the content was announced at the meeting and no separate documents were issued. The Third Special District Office is preparing to explain the process to the People's Daily.

　　The statement said that the county's workers' mission grain, "since October of last year according to the solar calendar, not a single grain has been collected (the original text was '交' - editor)." However, we have a receipt for 60 jin of mission grain for Yang Suoze (mistakenly written as Yang Zezhe in the statement) dispatched by Dongguanbi Village on December 2nd of last year according to the lunar calendar, covering the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, handled by Yang Fushun, the head of the village mutual aid group.

　　The Changzhi Yongsheng Porcelain Factory is an experimental porcelain factory led by the Border Region Government's Industrial Manufacturing Research Institute and located with the Institute. This should be clarified.

　　The statement specifically mentioned the workers' class status, implying that we were protecting landlords. To this end, the responsible comrades of our factory specifically visited Comrade Gai Liangbi of the Hukuan County Government to exchange views in order to clarify the facts. Here is a summary for everyone to study:

　　After seeing the suggestion in the newspaper, Comrade Gai asked the cadres of each village and wrote the draft statement based on the materials they provided, which led to discrepancies in the facts. Whether the class status of the four workers in Qingliu Village, Miao Shicheng and his son, Miao Biandan, and Han Guibao, is worker or peasant, still needs to be studied. As far as we know, their families are middle peasants in the village, but they have all worked in kilns since childhood until adulthood, never changing professions. The worker Han Guibao started working at the Changzhi porcelain factory in the spring of 1946. At that time it was the "Minjian Porcelain Factory" for production by the 17th Brigade, 50th Regiment. In the spring of 1947, the Border Region Government's Industrial Manufacturing Research Institute took over the factory to improve the porcelain industry. All of the original employees remained unchanged. At that time, Han Guibao asked for leave to go home for the New Year and participated in the war effort in the village. After returning, the village cadres came to the factory to demand people, using the excuse that "leaving the village without the village's consent is escaping participation in the war." After persuasion, they were not allowed to take people back to the village. Last autumn, when enlisting in the army, Qingliu Village came to the factory and asked worker Han Donggou to return to the village to enlist. We let him go. The next day, they came again to ask worker Han Guibao to return to the village to enlist. We let him go too. The day after that, the Han village came to ask workers Han Pangyin and Zhang Fuquan to return to the village to enlist. We also let them go. After Han Guibao returned to the village to register, he returned to the factory. We sent him back overnight to avoid any negative impact during his enlistment (the village's reply that night said "Thank you, thank you," etc., attached). Afterwards, Han Guibao was not selected by the army. After returning to the village, the village cadres detained him and did not allow him to return to the factory, ordering him to produce in the village. We sent people to the county government for negotiation, and finally managed to get him back. But the village illegally dispatched 50 jin of mission grain to him every month (that is, what Comrade Gai said was using 300 jin of labor income to cover six months of mission grain). They were also aware that this was inappropriate, but they claimed that it was "to prevent people from joining the army by sneaking into the factory" and that "the masses were dissatisfied" as an excuse for dispatching too much, which is unfounded!

　　As for Yang Suoze, he was originally an employee of the Minjian Porcelain Factory. Last spring, the person in charge of our factory went to the Hukuan County Government and obtained the consent of Secretary Gai Liangbi to work in our factory. Last summer, the worker-village relationship issue was discussed again at the county government. At that time, the village assigned Yang himself a summer tax burden based on an income of 120,000 yuan, while Yang only received a dividend of more than 29,000 yuan in the first half of the year, apart from managing living expenses. The certificate of proof was forwarded to the village by Secretary Gai, but the amount was still dispatched as before, with 90 jin of wheat taken. Starting in October, due to the factory's difficulties, some employees participated in the supply system, and a letter was forwarded to the village through the county government, proving the workers' income situation. However, the village dispatched 200 jin of public grain during the autumn tax collection (a total of 500 jin for his family, according to one notice), and 20 jin of mission grain every month were paid. The truth about his income has been certified to the village several times, but the village did not dispatch based on his actual income, but handled the issue based on the "belief that he had considerable income as a foreman." This is worth considering! During this face-to-face discussion with Comrade Gai Liangbi, he was very receptive and felt that it was inappropriate to only listen to the village cadres and use the term "foreman." Comrade Gai did not have specific materials on whether Yang Suoze was a landlord, but only heard the village cadres say that "his family had been struggled against three times and was a landlord." What we know is: it is not "running a landlord business." This issue has been handed over to the village work team and will be clear after the land is divided. On October 28th of last year, the village asked Yang Suoze to return to the village. We immediately let him return. After Yang was struggled against on December 19th, he returned to the factory. I also discussed the matter with Comrade Huang Laizhang, the political director of the village, who agreed that he could work in the factory. Comrade Gai Liangbi claimed that he did not know about this.

　　Regarding the relationship between village cadres and workers, we are indeed distressed. The village is unwilling for workers to leave the village, but the factory needs workers. This is a contradiction. Under this contradiction, the village often increases the burden on workers and uses various excuses to demand that workers return to the factory, or detains workers who return home and does not allow them to return to the factory, which greatly affects work. The original intention of my article was to hope that governments at all levels would pay attention and solve some of the problems! Now that we have received the Border Region Government's "Border Finance Review No. 4" circular, which stipulates in Article 6 of the first item of the burden policy: "Workers' wage income is generally higher than that of middle peasants. In order to balance the burden, all workers must pay taxes. Before the new method is stipulated, the Border Region Finance Office stipulates this year that each person shall bear 10 to 30 jin of millet per month according to their wage income. This can still be implemented, but the principle should be to collect it uniformly at the factory. After the workers bear the burden, the district and village governments and peasant associations should provide workers working in the liberated areas with convenience and freedom and should not restrict or block them." We are very happy to see this order and hope that governments at all levels will quickly communicate it to the districts and villages and implement it conscientiously!

　　Editor's Note

　　The essence of this problem lies in the narrow village-based thinking of the village cadres (some may have personal revenge). They use their power, under the guise of mass opinion, to restrict workers from going out to work in factories by various means. This kind of thinking and style is very bad. It will affect the development of industry in the liberated areas and cause mutual dissatisfaction between workers and peasants. We must recognize that developing industry and commerce and protecting industry and commerce is an important task in overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek, building a new China, and striving for revolutionary victory, and it must not be neglected in the slightest. Comrade Gai Liangbi of the Hukuan County Government, instead of considering the problem from this perspective, educating the village cadres and correcting their bad thinking and bad style, instead intentionally or unintentionally defends them, which is wrong. On the factory side, education should also be carried out for the workers to prevent possible adversarial sentiments and strive to improve technology and increase production.

### 壶关工人差米问题　陈虹同志来信说明

1948-03-11
第1版()
专栏：编读往来

　　壶关工人差米问题
  　陈虹同志来信说明编辑同志：
    二月二十日人民日报第一版登载壶关县府盖良弼同志的声明：该县“没有多收工人差米”。编者并问我二月一日报上“批评与建议”的稿子是根据什么写的？今答复如下：
    我们确实接到过太行三专署二月二十五日×字第四十六号及长治市府十二月十九日勤字第二号两份通知文件（原件附上），内容相同，皆谓根据太行行署规定：大意是自去年十一月份起工人支差米应交纳工厂所在地政府等……前日我特访问太行三专署，据刘秘书主任谈：此种通知算是正式命令。但只发给直属各厂，至于各县，因为当时正召开各县财粮科长会议，便在会上宣布了内容，未另发文件。此问题三专署准备向人民日报说明经过。
    声明中说：该县工人支差米，“自去年阳历十月后，颗粒未收（原文为交--编者）。而我们现有东关壁村去年阴历十二月二日派杨锁则（声明中误为杨贞则）的差米六十斤的收据，是阴历十、十一、十二、三个月的，由该村互助组长杨福顺经手。
    长治永生瓷厂是边府工业制造研究所领导的试验瓷厂，和研究所住在一起，顺便说明。
    声明中特别提到工人成份问题，意思是我们包庇地主了。为此本厂负责同志特到壶关县府访问盖良弼同志，交换意见，以弄清事实真象，现谨为其大意，以供大家研究：
    盖同志看到报上的建议后，曾问过各该村干部，根据村干部所谈材料写的声明稿子，这就使事实有了出入。清流村四个工人，苗石成父子，苗扁旦，韩贵宝的成份是工人或是农民，还应研究，据我们所知，其家庭在村上是中农，而个人均自幼皆在窑上作工，以至成人，从未转业。工人韩贵宝是一九四六年春即在长治这个瓷厂工作，当时是“民建瓷业工厂”为十七旅五十团的生产。一九四七年春边府工业制造研究所为了改良瓷业，接收此厂，原有职工均未变动。当时韩贵宝请假回家过旧年，曾在村上支差参战，回后即来厂上工，随后该村干部来厂要人，借口“未得村上同意出村，是逃避参战。”当经说服，未让其带人回村。去秋参军时，清流村来厂叫工人韩东狗回村参军，我们给了，次日又来叫韩贵宝回村参军，又给了，隔日韩村来叫工人韩胖银、张富全回村参军，我们也给了。韩贵宝回村报名后又回厂来，我们连夜派人送回，以免在参军期间，影响不好（现附该村当夜“多谢多谢”等语的回信）事后韩贵宝未被部队挑上，返村后村干部扣留不让回厂，令其在村生产，我们派人经县府交涉，始将他要回，而该村却违法派其每月支差米五十斤（即盖同志所说的以三百斤变工收入顶了六个月的支差米），亦自知不妥，却声明说是“怕参军钻进厂内”，“群众不满”为多派之借口，是无根据的！
    至于杨锁则，原是民建瓷厂职员，去春本厂负责同志曾去壶关县府当面取得盖秘书良弼同志同意，可以在本厂工作。去夏为工人与村上关系问题又在县府见面，也曾谈过。当时该村派杨本人夏征负担以十二万元收入算的，而杨在本厂上半年除管生活外，只分红二万九千余元。证明信经盖秘书转交村上，但仍照旧派数，出了九十斤麦子。十月份起因工厂困难，一部分职工参加供给制，亦经县府转信到村，证明工人收入情形。而该村秋征时又派公粮负担二百余斤（连其家中共五百斤，是一个派条），支差米每月二十斤皆出了。他的收入实情，几次皆有证明信去村，而村上不根据实际收入派取，却从“认为他当工头有相当收入”来处理问题，值得考虑！此次与盖良弼同志当面研究时，他很虚心，认为只听村干部所谈，又用“工头”字样，不大妥当。杨锁则是否经营地主成份，盖同志处无具体材料，只听村干部说：“其家被斗争过三次，是经营地主。”我们所知材料：并不是“经营地主”，此问题已交给该村工作组，平分土地之后自然明白。去年十月二十八日该村叫杨锁则回村，我们立即让其回去，十二月十九日杨被斗争后回厂，我亦曾当面与该村政治主任黄来章同志商谈，他同意其在厂工作。盖良弼同志自称不知此事经过。
    关于村干部和工人关系问题，我们确实感到苦恼。村上不愿工人出村，而工厂需要工人，这是个矛盾。在这个矛盾之下，村上往往加重工人负担，并借口各种问题来厂要回工人，或工人回家即扣留不放回厂，影响工作很大。我写那个稿子原是希望各级政府注意，解决一部分问题的！现在接到边府“边财审字第四号”通令，其中第一项负担政策内第六条规定：“工人工资收入，一般高于中农，为平衡负担，所有工人必须纳税，在新办法未规定前，今年边区财办规定，每人按其工资收入，每月负担十斤至三十斤小米，还可执行，但应以统一就厂征收为原则，在工人负担之后，区村政府农会，应该对工人在解放区内做工，给以方便与自由，不能加以限制和封锁。”看到这个命令，我们很高兴，希望各级政府，迅速传达到区村，切实执行！

　　编者的话
    这个问题的本质，在于村干部存有狭隘的村本位思想（个别也许有个人报复），他们利用职权，假借群众意见，用各种办法，限制工人出外参加工厂工作。这种思想作风是十分坏的，它会影响解放区工业的发展，会造成工人与农民间的相互不满。我们必须认识，发展工商业保护工商业，是打倒蒋介石建设新中国，争取革命胜利的一件重要工作，不能有丝毫忽视。壶关县府盖良弼同志，不从这里考虑问题，教育村干并纠正他们这种坏思想坏作风，反而有意无意的替他们辩护，是不对的。在工厂方面，亦应向工人进行教育，防止可能产生的对立情绪，努力提高技术增加生产。
