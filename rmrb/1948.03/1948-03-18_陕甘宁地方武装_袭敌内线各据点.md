(Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th) Local armed forces and guerrilla units in various parts of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, in coordination with our main forces' offensive operations in the Chiang-controlled areas, have been actively attacking various enemy strongholds on the inner lines. A certain unit of the local military corps of the Sanbian Military Sub-district, at dawn on the 10th, captured Ningtiaoliang, an important town 35 kilometers southeast of Anbian County. The enemy abandoned the town and fled north. Our infantry and cavalry took advantage of the victory and pursued them, engaging them in a fierce battle at Liuguiwan, five kilometers northeast of Ningtiaoliang, for two hours, completely annihilating one enemy company and one platoon. Five enemy soldiers, including a platoon leader, were killed, twenty were wounded, and 106 officers and soldiers, including the puppet Jingbian County Magistrate Han Ziqian and Company Commander Feng Zhenchao, were captured. Two machine guns, eighty-three rifles and carbines, and five warhorses were seized. Our Dingbian guerrilla unit, after a day and night of rapid marching, arrived in the Yangzhang area on the morning of the 7th, routing over a hundred bandits who were looting grain, capturing six bandits alive, and returning all the seized grain and livestock to the masses. The Yanxi Guerrilla Detachment of our Yanshu Military Sub-district has been active on the highway between Yan'an and Laoshan for several days. In three days, they cut down 750 catties of electric wire, destroyed several enemy fortifications, and distributed more than 990 leaflets and slogans. Furthermore, in February, the local armed forces and guerrilla units of the Guanzhong Military Sub-district engaged the enemy in 25 battles, eliminating 124 enemy soldiers, including 92 enemy soldiers of company commander rank and below who were killed or wounded.
