　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Tokyo Dispatch: According to Agence France-Presse, the Japanese workers' strike movement demanding wage increases has formed a "nationwide strike wave from north to south." 60,000 workers in Tokyo held a large demonstration on the 19th to protest against the reactionary government's proposed poor basic wage standard of 2,920 yen per month. According to various dispatches, from the end of February to the 20th of this month, the number of Japanese workers and staff who went on strike has reached more than one million, including the 500,000-member Railway Workers' Union and the now 400,000-member Transportation Workers' Union. Other industry unions have also joined successively, such as the 250,000-member Coal Miners' Union, the Public Service Employees' Union, and the Municipal and Electrical Workers' Union. The strike areas include Hokkaido, the Kanto region, northern and central Honshu, and even Kyushu (Japan's largest coal-producing area), including many large cities. Workers have adopted various forms of struggle, including "taking leave from the government," 24-hour strikes, reducing electricity supply by one hour within three days, and absenteeism and go-slows. Some coal miners' representatives even went to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to hold a hunger strike in front of the gate. The strike movement has severely affected various departments such as post offices, transportation, telecommunications, trains, coal mines, electricity, shipbuilding, and government administration. According to Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th, the Ashida Cabinet has been greatly weakened as a result.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: According to Agence France-Presse, 18th: 4,500 coal miners in Yorkshire, England, went on strike, 3,000 of whom demanded changes to the wage regulations, and 1,500 of whom were laid off due to a strike by electricians in several mine shafts.
