　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Reports from various sources: World democratic youth are commemorating "World Youth Week," from the 21st to the 28th, with resolute actions to strengthen unity and defend world peace. Major cities in the Soviet Union held grand "Conferences of Unity of World Democratic Youth." On the eve of Youth Week, V. Vonova, Chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, called out: "Democratic youth of the world, unite and fight for peace, democracy, independence, and against warmongers!" Youth from the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe and Italy sent letters to the committee congratulating Soviet youth. Romanian students established a unified student organization during Youth Week. Fifteen thousand young people in Yugoslavia decided to actively participate in the construction of "New Belgrade City" this year. Progressive youth groups in Australia held mass demonstrations in Melbourne and Sydney at the start of Youth Week. Demonstrating youth held banners reflecting various youth demands, such as: Fight for security and against oppression, youth of all countries unite to strive for universal peace, freedom of education, and improvement of youth life. Sydney youth held a mass meeting after the parade, where speakers unanimously declared: World youth vow to do everything in their power to stop a new war; and called on American youth to take action and resist U.S. imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Moscow News: The united struggle of world youth is strengthening under the leadership of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY). This is reflected in the WFDY Executive Committee meeting held in Rome in late February. According to *Pravda*, since the last meeting of the Executive Committee, Bulgaria has established a unified youth organization, cooperation agreements have been concluded between youth groups in Poland, the new mass youth organization "Garibaldi Vanguard" in Italy is expanding daily, and democratic youth organizations have been established in General Markos's troops and in the Greek liberated areas. New members joining WFDY include: the Australian Catholic Socialist Youth Society, the Icelandic Socialist Youth Society, the Guatemalan Democratic Youth League, the Brazilian Student Union, and the British Youth Machine Workers Union. The Executive Committee called on all WFDY members and youth groups to support the fighting youth and participate in the common struggle of all democratic forces; and decided to establish a central bureau and an international assistance foundation under the auspices of WFDY to assist the fighting youth. The Executive Committee announced February 21st as the Day of Solidarity between World Democratic Youth and Youth in Colonial and Dependent Countries, and April 14th as the Day of Solidarity with Spanish Democratic Youth. The Executive Committee emphasized that supporting the democratic youth of colonial and dependent countries persecuted by imperialism and its lackeys is the task of WFDY; and emphasized launching a campaign to aid the fighting youth in Spain and Greece. This summer, the International Labor Youth Conference will be held in Poland, and the WFDY Secretariat has begun preparations. At the WFDY Executive Committee meeting, it was decided to strengthen ties with the International Union of Students (IUS) and to criticize the IUS for not thoroughly implementing WFDY's resolution on strengthening ties between student groups and other youth groups.
