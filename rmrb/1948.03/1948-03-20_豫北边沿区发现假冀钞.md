　　News from Taihang: A large number of fake Ji banknotes have been discovered in the border area of Anyang and Tangyin in northern Henan. Before and after the Lunar New Year, 686,900 yuan of fake Ji banknotes were seized in towns such as Yigou and Hebi in Tangyin. Several tens of thousands of yuan were seized in a single day at the Xiaoxinzhuang Coal Mine in Anyang. The seized fake banknotes included large-format red 500 yuan notes, small-format 500 yuan notes, red and blue 200 yuan notes, blue 200 yuan notes, large-format yellow 500 yuan notes (the ox's rein in the note is broken), and two newly issued small-format green 500 yuan notes (one type has blurred printing and unclear background). According to the arrested counterfeiters, since Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Anyang were besieged by us, there has been an unprecedented shortage of various supplies. Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division and the bandit Wang Ziquan have set up printing factories in Anyang city (also in Xinxiang) to specifically print fake Ji banknotes, attempting to steal materials from our liberated areas with a large number of fake banknotes, disrupt our finance, and achieve their illusion of solving the material difficulties. The methods for promoting fake banknotes are: (1) Using unscrupulous merchants to mix into the liberated areas to exchange for materials at high prices, and using 20,000 yuan of fake Ji banknotes to buy 2,000 yuan of our real banknotes. (2) Using poor farmers in the border areas to go to our mountain strongholds and remote small villages to buy goods at high prices, deceiving farmers who do not know the difference between real and fake banknotes. (3) Distributing them to soldiers and letting the soldiers use their relationships to promote them.
