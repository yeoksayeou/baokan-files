Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. As the People's Liberation Army's powerful offensive achieves continuous victories, Chiang bandits' major cities are filled with alarm. A Jinan dispatch on the 15th revealed: searches within the city are extremely strict. The Chiang bandit city defense headquarters hurriedly issued thirteen articles of "Military-Civilian Guidelines," strictly ordering the strengthening of "joint security" control, "those without identification cards will be arrested without exception," "those who privately hide firearms will be executed," and grain and "all daily necessities will be controlled." All entertainment venues in the city have now been ordered to cease operations completely. Under the powerful offensive of the East China People's Liberation Army, the Chiang bandits even announced on the 16th that "Jinan's city defense has been completely deployed," weakly shouting the slogan "Defend Jinan." At the same time, the Chiang bandit garrison headquarters in Shanghai has requested Nanjing to increase the number of railway police on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhu (Shanghai-Hangzhou) railways, and held a hurried military meeting last weekend to "formulate" a so-called "general plan" to protect the two railways. In Shenyang, from 5:00 AM on the 14th, Chiang bandits dispatched 25,000 military police and district chiefs to conduct a general household registration check throughout the city, and will conduct random checks daily thereafter.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to Chiang area newspaper reports: An incident occurred in Beiping where more than two thousand starving people destroyed a Chiang bandit cooperative. The Chiang bandit government in Beiping "rationed" flour three times. Each time, the bandit social bureau sold flour tickets, and then people went to the "cooperative" to collect the flour. When the "cooperative" in the three districts within Beiping city distributed the flour, the procedures were complicated and there were many difficulties. Whenever citizens had two "rationing notices," one was confiscated for embezzlement purposes. On January 19th, starving people waited in the cold wind after the snow for a whole day, but still could not receive the flour for sale. The public sentiment was indignant. They rushed in and destroyed the "cooperative."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Chongqing News: The "Police Dog Training Institute," a Chiang bandit special agent organization located in Haitangxi, South Bank, Chongqing, was destroyed by more than 20,000 people last month on the 26th. Because children often go missing from residents near the institute, rumors circulated that the institute kidnapped children to feed the police dogs. On the afternoon of the 26th of last month, the masses rushed into the institute to investigate in a state of anxiety, and found children's clothes and a human bone. The public was in an uproar. The parent of a missing child, Li Xiaoting, identified the clothes as those worn by his son and immediately burst into tears. The crowd grew larger and larger, numbering about 20,000. Fueled by hatred and anger, the masses immediately beat up all the Chiang bandit bloodsucking lackeys in the institute, destroyed all the houses and furniture, and then set fire to five western-style buildings, the lairs of sin.

　　我军强大攻势节节胜利
  　蒋匪各大城市极惊慌
    北平饥民捣毁蒋匪合作社
    【新华社陕北十八日电】在人民解放军强大攻势节节胜利之际，蒋匪各大城市草木皆兵。十五日济南消息透露：城内搜查甚严，蒋匪城防司令部急忙颁布“军民须知”十三条，严令加强“联保”管制，“如无身份证者一律逮捕”、“私藏枪支者枪决”，粮食及“一切日用品均受管制”。全市娱乐场所现已被勒令全部停止营业。在华东解放军强大攻势下，十六日蒋匪更宣布“济市城防已作万全部署”，有气无力的喊出“捍卫济南”的口号了。与此同时，沪市蒋匪警备司令部已向南京请求增加京沪及沪杭两铁路之路警，并在上周末召开军事会议手忙脚乱的“拟制”所谓保护该两铁路的“总计划”。沈阳自十四日晨五时起蒋匪曾出动二万五千军警宪兵及区保长进行全市户口总清查，自此并将每日抽查。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据蒋区报纸消息：北平曾发生二千余饥民捣毁蒋匪合作社事件。蒋匪政府在北平“配售”面粉三次，每次都由匪社会局出售面票，再到“合作社”领面，平市内三区“合作社”发面时，手续繁杂，多方留难。凡遇市民有两份“配售通知单”者，即没收一份，以便进行贪污。一月十九日饥民在雪后的寒风中等候一天，还领不到代售面粉，群情激愤，一拥而入，将该“合作社”捣毁。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】重庆讯：重庆南岸海棠溪蒋匪特务机构“警犬训练所”，于上月二十六日被两万余群众所捣毁。因该所附近居民常有小孩失踪，民间盛传该所劫绑小孩喂饱警犬。上月二十六日下午群众情急闯入该所察看，发现有孩童衣服及人骨一条，群情大哗，失儿家长李笑廷认明衣服系其子所穿者，当即号啕大哭。群众越聚越多，约有两万人，在仇恨怒火燃烧下，群众当即痛殴该所全体蒋匪吸血爪牙，并捣毁一切房屋家具，继即放火烧毁罪恶魔窟洋楼五幢。
