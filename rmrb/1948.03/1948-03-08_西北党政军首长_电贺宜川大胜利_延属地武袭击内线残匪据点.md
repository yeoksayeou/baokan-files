Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th: Northwest Party, government, and military leaders Lin Boqu, He Long, and Xi Zhongxun, jointly telegraphed Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, Deputy Commanders Zhang Zongxun and Zhao Shoushan, and forwarded to all commanders and fighters at the front lines, congratulating them on the unprecedented great victory in the Yichuan area, stating: "After two months of training, our army is strong and well-equipped. We marched south and in one fell swoop completely annihilated the Kuomintang-Hu bandit army's 29th Army Headquarters, the 90th Division, the two division headquarters of the 27th Division, and all five brigades of their main forces in the Yichuan area and its southwest, and once again liberated Yichuan County. Enemy generals Liu Kan, Yan Ming, and others were all captured without exception. This unprecedented great victory not only created a new record for annihilating the enemy on the Northwest battlefield but will also powerfully coordinate with the various Liberation Armies across the country to accelerate the demise of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. The good news arrived, and the masses rejoiced. In addition to convening a victory celebration meeting to mobilize the people of the entire border region to continue to support the front lines, we first represent all the Party, government, military, and people to congratulate you and extend our cordial greetings."

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th: After the main forces of the Liberation Army advanced into the Kuomintang-controlled areas to fight, the local armed forces and guerrillas in the Yan'an area attacked enemy strongholds behind the lines everywhere. A certain unit attacked Zhangcunyizhan, an important town in a certain county, on February 24th, annihilating most of the enemy security police team and routing the enemy reinforcements from the same county, killing and capturing 18 enemy personnel, including a battalion commander. On the 21st, they also routed a platoon of the transport battalion of the enemy's 27th Division and more than 300 security police who were looting grain in the Weita and Louerping areas of the second district of Ansai, killing and capturing eight enemy personnel. On the 19th, a certain guerrilla unit raided the Baijiaya coal mine, 50 li east of Yan'an, at night, and after an hour of fierce fighting with the first battalion of the enemy's Security 11th Regiment, captured five pillboxes. On the 29th, a certain unit charged into the streets of Dalaoshan, and after a fierce battle with the enemy, withdrew on their own initiative. Under these circumstances, the resentment and panic of the Chiang bandits and local bullies are growing daily. Zhang Yaxuan, the puppet county magistrate of Ganquan County, hinted to his subordinates that they should be prepared to flee at any time. A folk song is circulating among the enemy and puppets in Ganquan County, saying: "The security police team has corn porridge with no vegetables, the regular army has four steamed buns but their stomachs are too empty"; a folk song is also circulating among the masses in the city, saying: "The Central Army (Chiang bandits) has no money to spend, they search when they leave the village, and take everything they see; no half-bowl of rice is left in the people's homes, people don't talk when they meet, every household that is searched has good people tortured."

　　西北党政军首长
  　电贺宜川大胜利
  　延属地武袭击内线残匪据点
    【新华社西北六日电】西北党政军首长林伯渠、贺龙、习仲勋，三日联名致电彭副总司令、张宗逊、赵寿山两副司令员，并转前线全体指战员庆贺宜川地区空前大捷称：“我军于争取两个月整训之后，兵强马壮，挥戈南下，一举即在宜川及其西南地区全歼蒋胡匪军二十九军军部、九十师、二十七师两个师部及其主力部队五个旅全部，并再次解放宜川县城。敌军将领刘戡、严明等以下无一漏网。此种空前巨大胜利，不仅创造了西北战场歼敌的新纪录，且将有力的配合全国各解放军加速卖国贼蒋介石的灭亡。捷报传来，万众欢腾，我们除将召开祝捷大会，动员全边区人民继续努力支援前线外，特先代表党政军民全体，向你们祝贺，并致亲切的慰问。
    【新华社西北六日电】延（安）属分区地方武装和游击队于解放军主力挺进蒋管区作战后，到处袭击内线残敌据点。某部于二月廿四日袭击＠县重镇张村驿，歼敌保警队大部，并击溃由＠县赶援之敌，毙俘敌营长以下十八名。廿一日又击溃向安塞二区魏塌、楼儿坪一带抢粮之敌二十七师辎重营一个排及保警队三百余人，毙俘敌八名。十九日某游击队夜袭延安东五十里之白家牙炭厂，与敌保十一团第一营激战一小时，攻下碉堡五座。廿九日某部曾冲入大劳山街内，与敌激战后，自动撤出。蒋匪土顽等在此处境下懑怨与恐慌情绪正日益增长中。甘泉县伪县长张亚选曾暗示部属随时准备逃跑。甘泉敌伪流行两句歌谣说：“保警队玉米糊汤没有菜，正规军四个馍馍肚子空的太”；城内群众中也流行一首歌谣说：“中央军（蒋匪）没钱花，出了村要搜查，见了东西一齐拿；百姓家不放半碗米，两人见面不拉话，每查户，就有良民被拷打”。
