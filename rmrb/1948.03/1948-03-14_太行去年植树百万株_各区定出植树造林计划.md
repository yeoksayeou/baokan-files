　　Taihang Planted One Million Trees Last Year
  　Various Regions Set Afforestation Plans
    [Report from this newspaper] Taihang, Taiyue, and Jinnan have formulated afforestation plans. The Taihang region achieved success in afforestation last year. According to statistics from twelve counties, a total of 1,054,350 trees were planted. In Ping顺 (Píngshùn) County alone, 311,500 trees were planted in the spring, with a survival rate of 65% due to the spring drought. In the autumn, another 1,054,350 mulberry cuttings were sown, and 28,760 mu of mountains were closed off for afforestation. Twelve shi and two dou of tree seeds were collected, and a total of 156 mu of small nurseries were established, with 143 mu already sown. Along the Shahe River, eighteen villages planted 287,858 trees in the spring, averaging fourteen trees per person, with a survival rate of 96%. Last autumn, Xinzhai Village alone replanted 90,000 trees voluntarily. Along the Qingzhang River in She County, a total of 120,000 trees were planted last year. Along the Changzhi-Licheng section of the Handan-Changzhi Highway, 9,518 trees were planted, with a survival rate of 64%. The specific experiences are: First, leaders personally take action and organize concretely. This is especially important for larger-scale afforestation. Last spring, along the Handan-Changzhi Highway and the Shahe River, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and the local government and masses jointly formed afforestation committees. Training classes and symposiums were held in advance to mobilize and prepare, with strict division of labor and responsibility for each section. In addition, the personal involvement of leading cadres played a significant role in promoting the afforestation movement in Ping顺 County. The County Head personally carried water and climbed mountains to plant trees, and the Head of the Construction Section collected tree seedlings everywhere, which greatly contributed to the development of the afforestation movement in Ping顺. Second, leaders consistently implement the work throughout the year, emphasizing both afforestation and tree protection equally. In the past, many trees were planted but few survived. The masses in She County reflected, "Trees are planted every year, but they die every year; every spring, there is a disaster." This is a serious satire of our bureaucracy by the masses and should be strictly corrected. Third, closely integrate with the interests of the masses, mobilize the masses, and create a mass upsurge. This includes afforestation along the Shahe River and the Left Power Flood Prevention Forest, as well as clearly defining land rights and combining them with the masses' interests in collecting mountain products and sideline businesses. Based on the demands of the masses for afforestation last year, the Taihang Administrative Office has proposed a plan for this year. In addition to a general call for large-scale afforestation, it specifically stipulates: The First Administrative District will be responsible by the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, focusing on Shahe and Xingtai, requiring another 300,000 trees to be planted along the Shahe River this year, and also planting a large number of trees in Jiangshui and Luochuan in Xingtai. The Second Administrative District will be responsible by the Zuoquan Agricultural and Forestry Bureau. Zuoquan will continue to plant another 100,000 trees this year. Heshun Mountain Area will focus on closing off mountains for forest protection. The Third Administrative District will be responsible by the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, focusing on both sides of the Handan-Changzhi Highway, replanting 30,000 trees along both sides of the highway. The Fourth Administrative District will focus on both banks of the Qin River, and the Fifth Administrative District will focus on both banks of the Qingzhang River. She County alone plans to plant 100,000 trees and is currently convening the heads of agricultural and forestry bureaus and construction cadres from various regions to study and deploy the work. Taiyue also recently issued instructions, requiring agencies, organizations, and schools to plant and keep alive one tree per person, and an average of one tree per household throughout the region. Mountainous counties will focus on sowing seeds for afforestation and closing off mountains for forest protection. Plain counties will focus on cutting branches for planting. Along highways, railways, main roads, riverbanks, and ditches, both plains and mountains must be replanted, and each county is ordered to restore nurseries this year. Sixty nurseries are pre-set up throughout the region (approximately one for every three administrative districts), and sixty additional nursery workers are added, with expenses paid by local grain funds. The Jinnan Administrative Office calls on the entire region, regardless of gender or age, to plant and keep alive an average of one tree per person, and to cultivate a small tree nursery in each village, sowing apricot, peach, elm, locust, and cypress seeds, etc., to cultivate small tree seedlings in the village edges, house corners, and vacant land. The nearby villages will be responsible for planting and managing the highways, railways, river dikes, and sandy wastelands, and the benefits will belong to each village. The administrative office will approve and issue funds for large-scale afforestation.

　　太行去年植树百万株
  　各区定出植树造林计划
    【本报消息】太行、太岳、冀南制订植树造林计划。太行区去年在植树造林方面，已获有成就。据十二个县统计，共植树一百零五万四千三百五十株，其中仅平顺一县春季即植树卅一万一千五百株，因春旱成活百分之六十五。秋季又播种压桑条一百零五万四千三百五十株，全县禁山造林二万八千七百六十亩，搜集树籽十二石二斗，建立小型苗圃共一百五十六亩，已播种者一百四十三亩。沙河沿岸春季十八个村植树廿八万七千八百五十八株，每人平均十四株，成活数达百分之九十六。去秋仅辛寨一村，群众自动补栽九万株。涉县清漳沿岸，去年共植十二万株。邯长路长黎段，植树九千五百一十八株，成活百分之六十四。其具体经验是：第一、领导上亲自动手具体组织。特别是较大规模的植树造林，更加重要。去春邯长公路及沙河沿岸等地，都由农林局与当地政府群众合组植树（造林）委员会。并于事先召开训练班座谈会动员筹备，严密分工分段负责，此外领导干部亲自动手，推动作用很大。如平顺县书亲自担水爬山植树，建设科长到处搜集树苗，对开展平顺植树运动有很大作用。第二、领导上有始有终贯彻全年，植树造林与保树护林同时并重。过去栽的多活的少，涉县群众反映：“年年栽树年年死，每年春天有一遭。”这是群众对我们官僚主义的严重讽刺，应严格纠正。第三、与群众利益密切结合，发动群众，造成群众热潮。如沙河岸植树及左权防洪林，以及明确规定地权与群众采集山货副业利益相结合等。太行行署根据去年群众要求植树造林情况，提出今年计划，除一般号召大量植树造林外，并具体规定：一专由邢台农林局负责，以沙河邢台为重点，要求沙河沿岸今年再植三十万株，邢台浆水、路罗川等地也大量栽植。二专由左权农林局负责。左权继续去年再植十万株。和昔山区着重禁山护林。三专由长治农林局负责，以邯长公路两侧为重点，公路两旁补植三万株。四专以沁河两岸为重点，五专以清漳两岸为重点，仅涉县即计划植十万株，刻正召集各地农林局长及专署建设干部研究布置中。太岳亦于最近发出指示，要求机关团体学校，每人植活一株树，全区平均每户植活一株树，山地县以播种造林、禁山护林为主。平原县以插枝植树为主。在公路、铁路、大道、河岸、水渠两旁，不论平地山地一律补植，并命令各县今年恢复苗圃，全区预设苗圃六十处（约三个行政区一处），增设苗圃工人六十名，由地方粮款开支。冀南行署向全区号召无论男女老幼，平均每人植活一株树，每村培造小树苗圃一处，在村边、屋角、隙地播种杏、桃、榆、槐、柏籽等，以培植小树苗。公路、铁道、河堤、沙荒，由附近各村分段负责栽植保管，收益归各村所有。大举造林经费，由行署核发。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（敬庭）
