Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Washington Dispatch: US Senator from Idaho and Wallace's vice-presidential candidate, Taylor, delivered a lengthy speech in the US Senate on the 9th, vehemently denouncing the US reactionary policy of supporting the traitor Roxas and the tyrant Chiang Kai-shek in the Far East. Taylor said: "Chiang Kai-shek's enthusiastic friends say that Chiang is a benevolent dictator. But from what I have heard from people who have lived in China, and from what I know from books and newspapers, I believe he is one of the most brutal tyrants the world has ever known. He is corrupt, greedy, and cruel. As far as the welfare of the Chinese people is concerned, he has no patriotism whatsoever." He also said: "China (Chiang Kai-shek's controlled area) is in utter chaos, and this is the most disreputable of our adventures. By supporting Chiang, we have betrayed the principles we once declared we would uphold." Taylor, in discussing the US reactionary policy in the Far East, stated: In the Philippines, the US handed over power to the traitor Roxas, an evil speculator who had collaborated with the Japanese, leaving the same feudal exploiters in power. In Japan, the people have suffered terrible oppression and are seeking liberation. In Korea, we have also handed over power to the same exploiters who helped Japan carry out its war of aggression. All aspects prove that the people in the Soviet-occupied zone live more happily than their counterparts in the US-occupied zone. Taylor believes that the current US foreign policy endangers world peace.

　　美参议员泰勒演说痛斥蒋贼残暴统治
    【新华社陕北十三日电】华盛顿讯：美伊达荷州参议员、华莱士的副总统候选人泰勒，九日在美国参院中发表长篇演说，痛斥美国在远东扶持罗哈斯奸贼与蒋介石暴君的反动政策。泰氏说：“蒋介石热心的朋友说蒋是仁慈的独裁者。但从曾在中国住过的人们那里听到的，从书上与报上知道的，我相信他是世界上从未有过的最残酷的暴君之一，他腐败、贪婪和残忍。从中国人民福利看来，他没有半分爱国心”。又说：“中国（蒋匪统治区）紊乱一团糟，在我国所从事的冒险中，这是最不体面的一个。由于我们援蒋，我们已背弃了我们曾宣告信守的各种原则”。泰氏于纵论美国在远东的反动政策时称：在菲律滨，美国把统治权交给了曾和日本人合作的罪恶的投机家罗哈斯卖国贼，留下了同样封建剥削者的统治。在日本，人民遭受了可怕的压迫，并正自求解放。在朝鲜，我们也把权力交给那些曾帮助日本进行侵略战争的同样的剥削者之手。各方面均足证明，苏占区人民较其美占区的同胞，生活得更为美满。泰氏认为，美国的现行外交政策，危害了世界和平。
