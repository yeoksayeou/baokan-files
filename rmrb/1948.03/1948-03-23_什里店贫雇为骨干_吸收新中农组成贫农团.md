　　Taking Poor and Hired Peasants as the Backbone
　　Absorbing New Middle Peasants to Form Poor Peasants' Leagues
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] After initial class demarcation, the masses in Shili Dian, the ninth district of Wu'an, found that poor and hired peasants accounted for more than one-third of the entire population (those previously designated as targets of struggle were temporarily excluded), and together with new middle peasants, they accounted for more than three-quarters. Among them, more than 30 households were still significantly in debt, and the rest were mostly just recently liberated, with little savings and a weak foundation. They requested to organize a Poor Peasants' League to take the lead in the democratic movement and land redistribution campaign, and to be masters of their own affairs. After seven days of preparation, the Poor Peasants' League held its founding meeting on March 14th and, based on the principle of free association, gradually formed 21 groups, moving towards an organized democratic life.

　　Seriously Plant the Seeds, Carefully Select Initiators
　　On the evening of March 7th and the morning of the 8th, each group of poor peasants deliberated on who should be the initiator of the Poor Peasants' League. The working team first found the relatively reliable poor and hired peasants who had already been connected in each group to discuss, and then these poor and hired peasants found the poor peasants in each group to hold a meeting for deliberation. The principle was that all poor peasants should participate, and a small number with major problems should not be allowed to participate. They discussed why the Poor Peasants' League should be established, how to organize the Poor Peasants' League, and what conditions the initiators should have. Then they discussed who could be the initiator. The masses had very strict requirements and were very discerning. The person nominating explained the advantages of the person they nominated, and the person nominated made a self-criticism. Everyone then launched into criticism. As a result of the discussion and selection, those with shortcomings were eliminated, and those who were to be submitted to the general meeting for a vote had very few shortcomings. The masses believed that the best people were those who had long suffered poverty, were honest and loyal, were good housekeepers, were upright and impartial, did not cling to the legs of landlords and rich peasants, were approachable to the masses, and were not hooligans or corrupt, and were not vengeful or protective. They were unwilling to elect those who were "honest but only cared about money" (selfish and self-interested); they were also unwilling to elect those who had no other shortcomings but were not enthusiastic about doing things for everyone, or were hard of hearing and inconvenient to work for everyone. In self-criticism and mutual criticism, it also played a good educational role for the general masses. According to the masses, such a serious and democratic election and heated criticism was a first in Shili Dian.

　　On the afternoon of the 8th, a village-wide meeting of poor peasants was held, and the initiators proposed by each group were submitted to the meeting for selection and approval by all the village's poor peasants. Each group of people made a self-criticism according to the conditions stipulated by everyone, and the masses pointed out their advantages and disadvantages, and then the election was carried out. A total of 26 people were proposed by each group, and as a result, 16 people were selected. After the election, the masses spoke freely, instructing the initiators: "You are elected to plant the seeds; you are like building a house, you must lay a good foundation." "Do not retaliate, do not be partial, connect good people to join the league, and lead the masses on the right path." "From now on, we will be masters of our own affairs. Unite and don't have internal disagreements, which will make the landlords happy." The initiators replied: "I will go wherever everyone wants me to go." "We didn't do well in the past, but everyone must unite in the future. We will let whoever everyone wants to join the league join the league, and no one can bribe us!" "We have not done anything in the past, but this time it is for the liberation of the poor, so we will try our best. Everyone is watching, and we will never protect or retaliate."...

　　Prevent Closed-Doorism, Strengthen Our Own Ranks
　　On the evening of the 8th, the initiators gathered to discuss how to organize the Poor Peasants' League. Who should be allowed to participate? At first, two initiators set the criteria too broadly. One said: "Half of the old middle peasants are good and can be absorbed." Other initiators criticized this view: "This is the Poor Peasants' League. It is not appropriate for old middle peasants to participate. They don't know the suffering we have endured, and their hearts are always a little different from ours. They can be in the Peasants' Association." Some people set the conditions too strictly: "Only old-fashioned people are allowed." "Must not be selfish." "Those who have been hooligans and corrupt are not allowed." "Those who have been air-raid shelters are not allowed." Other initiators also criticized the above opinions: "As long as they are on the same side as us poor people, they should all be absorbed. Small selfishness is not important; we can educate them. Everyone takes them along, and they will change. Who doesn't have a little problem? As long as it doesn't ruin everyone's affairs, as long as they can change, it's nothing." "Some people are just bad-mouthed, but their hearts are not bad; it's okay to correct them." "It also depends on what kind of air-raid shelter you were; those who were only a little bit should be allowed in if they change and no longer do it. You can't say that someone is a landlord's running dog just because they sent a gift or swept the courtyard once or twice." "Young people are not hooligans if they are corrupt once or twice; as long as they can change, they should be allowed to join the league."

　　How to organize it? After discussion, everyone decided: "Each group of initiators should think about who in their group meets the conditions, and they can negotiate together. After the negotiation is settled, they will talk to the person to be absorbed; if they have a problem, they will ask if they can correct it. If they are determined to change, we will make a condition with them (what if they don't change?) and let them in. Those who are absorbed should also be asked to study and study with each other, and we can't just decide for them."

　　The initiators also set a few rules for themselves: 1. Do not have internal disagreements. 2. Do not protect or retaliate. Absorb whoever meets the conditions. 3. Do not stand on the heads of the masses and act tough. 4. Correct your own mistakes and raise your opinions to others face to face. ...

　　After two days of deliberation, on the morning of the 11th, the initiators met to discuss "who not to want" and "who to want," dividing the people into three categories: one is those with major problems that cannot be changed for a while, temporarily not wanting them; one is those with problems who are determined to change, and they will be wanted if they change; and one is those with no major problems, who will be immediately absorbed to participate. As soon as a poor peasant participates, they are considered a formal member; new middle peasants must be approved by each group and then by the general meeting to be considered formal members.

　　In the first two days, some groups thought that they should absorb as much as possible if they had no major problems, and two groups closed the door too tightly, only developing five or six people in two days. Some were afraid that "they look like they have small problems now, but if they come in and rely on being a member of the league, they will go bad." The initiators of the other groups criticized: "Everyone is watching. If they go bad after they come in, the masses can also kick them out." After discussing "who not to want," those who were close to the landlord, those who liked to hold grudges, those who were revengeful, those who were openly deceitful, and a few who would rather not join the Poor Peasants' League than not be corrupt were singled out and decided not to be wanted. The groups all dared to develop. Some people who were temporarily left out for two days showed great anxiety and restlessness. At this time, the initiators went to talk to them, and they expressed their determination to change, and they were all absorbed. When joining the league, they all made self-criticisms and launched mutual criticisms. They developed in batches and discussed collectively in batches, and everyone examined the people joining the league. A wave of criticism and self-criticism was launched, and ideological awareness was raised a step. At the same time, the ranks of the Poor Peasants' League were organized relatively quickly, and they did not drag on for too long in the connection process. Then, they individually connected with new middle peasants who had been liberated not long ago but were not too high up and met the conditions for league members, and also conducted criticism and self-criticism in the groups. By the day before the founding meeting, a total of 209 league members had been developed, including 142 poor peasants and 67 new middle peasants.

　　Combine Examination of Party Members, Let Good Party Members Join the League
　　While deliberating on the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, they continued to carry out the democratic movement. Each group held mass meetings to put forward opinions on party member cadres and elected representatives to give opinions to party members face to face at the branch's enlarged meeting to help rectify the party. They raised opinions for half a day on the afternoon of the 10th, and although it was raining at night, they still held a meeting, and the opinions were raised very enthusiastically and in an orderly manner. (According to the masses: "In the past, meetings were either a mess or no one said anything.") Because they saw that they had their own organization, the masses reduced a lot of worries. In the initiators' meeting, when discussing who could participate in the Poor Peasants' League, someone proposed: "Good party members should also be allowed to participate. They are also from our poor and hired peasant ranks. As long as they are good people, let them come." Everyone agreed. Party members who the Poor Peasants' League initiators thought could participate in the Poor Peasants' League were asked to report on their reflections in the past few days at the Poor Peasants' League group meeting, make a serious self-criticism, and be criticized and examined by the masses in the same way as other league members when joining the league, and no special meeting for examining party members was held. Before the founding meeting, a total of ten party members recognized by the masses (some poor peasants, some new middle peasants) joined the Poor Peasants' League. Those who were poor peasants became formal members after joining; those who were new middle peasants made another detailed reflection report at the founding meeting, and the masses also seriously raised a lot of opinions. Among them, Wang Xitang, because he was the village chief, reflected on more things, and the masses raised more opinions. Some things that he forgot to talk about were supplemented by him after the masses raised them. Some of the things that the village chief should not be responsible for were also explained by Wang Xitang in a fact-seeking manner; the attitude of the masses was also fact-seeking, and after the explanation, they all said: "Very realistic, he talked about everything, big and small, and agreed with him joining the Poor Peasants' League." Wang Xitang said: "If everyone has something they don't want to say because I'm here, I'll go out, okay?" The masses shouted: "No need to go out!" The masses' comments on the reflections of the other people were also: "Very realistic!" or "This person's role as a party member is not enough, but he is a good person!" "That's just that little bit, and he said it himself, and he'll change it in the future."

　　Pay Attention to Mobilizing Women to Pour Out Their Grievances and Enlighten Their Consciousness
　　Among the sixteen initiators selected, there were three women. The shackles of feudal society had not been completely removed from them. They were good at labor, upright, and had harmonious relationships with their mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and neighbors. They were well-known good women in the village, but they had not yet developed the ability to handle affairs, and the scope of their activities was not large. There was only one female comrade in the work team, so at first, they had to develop the women in each family through the men. The women were still shy when attending various meetings and did not dare to speak. When they were asked to speak, although they said little, most of what they said was correct, and they had insight into the affairs of the village. When discussing the conditions for candidates, the women in one group first proposed "to be poor, to suffer, and to not dare to speak in the past," "to be upright and impartial, and not afraid of things," "not to be hooligans and corrupt, and not to have a lewd expression on their faces." They were also very correct in choosing specific people. Because they had a small scope of activity in the past, they were less contaminated with the bad habits of the old society in some aspects than men; they were able to put forward upright and sharp opinions. When forming the Poor Peasants' League group, at first they were mixed-gender groups, but later they asked to be separated. Some male league members said: "It's not good to separate. Women can't do anything alone." After they were separated, the women spoke more enthusiastically at the meetings. Poor peasant women had more pain, and they were more eager to be masters of their own affairs; at some meetings, women's speeches were prevented by her men, but the women still resolutely wanted to continue speaking. When the league members examined each other, several women, the members of the group poured out their grievances, raised their consciousness, and bravely and enthusiastically launched self-criticism and criticism, and told things that they had never been willing to tell in the past. When giving opinions to party member cadres, the women also gave opinions, criticizing the political director for forcing a woman to be the object of his brother, and criticizing the militia instructor, the public security officer, etc. for being hooligans and corrupt. Another woman proposed: "The public security officer beat his own wife until her eyes were black and blue, and he wanted other people's wives to be beaten and oppressed like his wife. My man is not upright either. I argued with him, and the public security officer said that I didn't want to live with my man, and I had to be dealt with, and he said to my man: 'I'm corrupt, and my wife can't control me; you can't do it!' This is how he incited our couple. Women don't dare to speak because of this."

　　The ideological mobilization of women was not done enough. It was only that some people began to move and began to speak. It developed well in terms of organization. When the Poor Peasants' League was established, there were nine women's groups in the twenty-one groups, and there were two groups that were mixed-gender. There were eighty women in the two hundred and nine league members, accounting for about two-fifths. There were four women on the fifteen Poor Peasants' League committee members.

　　Break Down Sectarianism, Oppose Factional Activities
　　It is said that before the establishment of the democratic government, the village of Shili Dian often fought with the lower street, especially every year on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. When the upper street's celebration reached the lower street, they would always have a fight when they were about to reach the south end, and sometimes they would wrestle on the river beach. After the establishment of the democratic government, this situation disappeared. It can be seen that this was entirely stirred up by the landlord. Although there have been no fights in recent years, they are still not very harmonious. This is because bad cadres and a few bad people have used this legacy of feudal society to cause disputes and compete for power and profit. The masses were unconsciously infected by this sectarian sentiment, and it was revealed again at the meeting to elect the initiators of the Poor Peasants' League. When electing the initiators of the village, the three candidates made self-criticisms, and two of them did have major shortcomings; suddenly a person from the lower street stood up and said: "These three people are not good! How did the village choose these three people?" An old woman from the village also came out and said: "It's not just those three who have shortcomings. I think these people in the village are very good!"... At this time, the worker explained to everyone: "When making comments, only make comments on this person, don't divide between the upper and lower streets. Everyone has mistakes, and it's okay to correct them." As a result of the election, two of the four people proposed by the village were elected. After all, only a few people engaged in sectarianism, and the masses still demanded unity. After the election, the masses urged the initiators: "It's right to unite everyone; if there is a split today, it will not be good if you create two halves of garlic, and the landlords will laugh at us." "The upper and lower streets are the same, one family, doing the same work. There are few seeds in the village, so go back and develop them well, and don't create divisions." After the meeting, seeing that the sectarian sentiment in the upper street had not been eliminated, the worker specially convened a meeting of poor peasants in the upper street, first letting a few people who liked to engage in sectarianism vent their grievances. One of the people who liked to engage in sectarianism the most said: "Let's divide the village!" Another person said: "It's the big village oppressing the small village, we are like daughters-in-law in a big family..." The worker waited until they had vented their anger almost, and then analyzed it for them, making them realize: "There are still many good people in the lower street, and many peaceful people. It's definitely not a big village oppressing a small village, it's just that a few people are not good. In the future, only unity is allowed to be promoted, and division is not allowed to be promoted. Don't let landlords and bad people exploit the loopholes of our poor peasants. Poor people don't have time to cause disputes. It was the landlord who caused it in the past, and it was the bad cadres and bad people who caused it in the future. Don't be fooled. Even if people's attitudes are not good when they criticize us, it's still right to raise opinions. In the future, poor peasants will take the lead in village affairs. How can we do it if we don't lead well?" The one or two people with particularly heavy sectarian sentiment in the lower street were also educated. The work team also realized that this could not be solved in isolation. The more urgent the solution, the more the masses would be entangled in this, which would hinder the normal development of the entire movement. The solution must be sought in the entire movement. A good democratic movement is also a unity movement. Attention should be paid to this issue in the organization of the Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association, and in the ideology of the league members. In the movement, the masses will unite because of the consistency of the struggle goals, and a whole can also be formed from the masses' reorganization of the ranks. In the subsequent movements, the work team paid attention to criticizing a few people with strong sectarian sentiments and educating some people with blind sectarian sentiments. When electing committee members and developing league members, special emphasis was placed on not absorbing those who held grudges and engaged in sectarianism. For a very small number of people who had always engaged in sectarianism, the initiators also paid attention to not absorbing them into the league for the time being. As a result, major and minor sectarian activities (such as those between the Fu and Li surnames and some other small groups that retaliated) basically subsided. However, some sects are historical and blind, and subsidence does not mean that they have been eliminated. Long-term attention still needs to be paid to overcoming them in the future.

　　什里店贫雇为骨干
   　吸收新中农组成贫农团
    【本报消息】武安九区什里店群众，经过初划阶级，划为贫雇农的占全体群众（过去被定为斗争对象的暂不列入）三分之一以上，再加上新中农共占四分之三以上；他们之中有三十多家还是显著的窟窿户，其余也大半是翻身不久、积蓄不多、底子还虚的。他们要求组织贫农团，在民主、填补运动中起带头作用，当家作主。经过七天的酝酿准备，贫农团已于三月十四日开了成立大会。并以自由结合为原则，陆续组成二十一个小组，逐渐走向有组织的民主生活。
  　认真扎酵子根　慎重选发起人
    三月七日晚上，八日上午，各组贫农分别酝酿让谁当贫农团发起人。由工作员找各组已串连起来的比较可靠的贫雇先讨论之后，就由这些贫雇找各组贫雇开会酝酿，原则是全体贫农都参加，少数有大毛病的不让参加。讨论了为啥成立贫农团，怎么样组织贫农团，发起人要有那些条件；然后就讨论谁能当发起人。群众的要求是很严格的，眼光也是明亮的，提名的人讲明他提出的人的好处，被提名的人自己作了自我批评，大家伙再展开批评；讨论、挑选的结果，有缺点的都被淘汰了，留下要提到大会上去表决的人，一般缺点都很少。群众认为最好的人是：长期受穷受苦的，老实忠厚的，好受家，正直不偏的，不抱地主富农粗腿的，群众敢到他跟前说话的，不流氓不腐化的，不报复不包庇的。对于“老实倒老实，可是一个劲往钱眼里钻”（自私自利）的人，他们也不愿选他；对于没别的缺点，可是不热心给大家办事，或耳朵聋给大家办事不方便的也不愿选。在自我批评和相互批评中，对一般群众也起了很好的教育作用。据群众反映，这样认真民主的选举和热烈的批评，在什里店还是第一次。
    八日下午，开了全村贫农大会，各组提出的发起人再提到大会上让全村贫农选择通过。各组提出的人都又按大家规定的条件作了自我批评，群众再给指出优缺点，然后进行选举。各组提出的共二十六人，结果选出十六个人。选举后，群众自由发言，嘱咐发起人：“把你们选出来，扎下酵子根了；你们象盖房子，要把根脚扎好。”“不要报复，不要偏，要串连好人入团，要把群众带到正路上。”“以后是咱自己当家了，要团结，不要自家闹意见、叫地主高兴。”发起人回答说：“大家要我往那里走我往那里走。”“过去翻身没翻好，以后大家要团结。大家要谁入团咱就让谁入团，谁也买不了咱！”“咱过去没办过事，不过这次是为了穷人翻身，咱尽量办；大家看着，咱决不包庇，不报复。”………
    　防止关门主义　壮大自己队伍
    八日晚，发起人集会，讨论怎样组织贫农团。找那些人参加呢？开始有两个发起人把尺度放得太宽了，一个说：“老中农有一半个好的也可以吸收。”别的发起人对这种意见批评说：“咱这是贫农团，旧中农参加不相当，他们不知道咱受的苦，心眼跟咱总差一点，他们可以在农会。”有的人把条件限的太严了：“要老气人才行。”“要不自私自利。”“流氓腐化过的不要。”“当过防空洞的不要。”别的发起人也对以上这些意见加以批评：“只要是跟咱穷人一条心的就都该吸收进来，小的自私自利不要紧；可以教育他，大家带着他走，就改过来了。谁还没有点小毛病，只要不坏大家的事，只要能改，就没啥。”“有些人光是嘴坏，心眼不坏；要他纠正纠正也就可以了。”“当防空洞，也要看是当那一等的；小小不然的，他改了以后不再当了，还可以要他。给地主送过一两次礼扫过院子，也不能就说是地主走狗。”“年轻人，腐化一两次也不算流氓；只要能改，改了还应该要他入团。”
    怎么组织呢？大家商量后决定：“各组发起人想好各组那个人合乎条件，可以要，就在一起商量，商量定了就去找要吸收的人谈；他有点毛病，就问他能纠正不能，他决心要改，咱就和他订个条件（不改了怎么办？），让他进来；不肯改，要暂时在外面放放。吸收进来的，还要叫大家相互研究研究，也不能光咱决定就为准。”
    发起人还给自己定了几条规矩：一、不闹意见，不抱小疙瘩。二、不包庇，不报复，谁够条件就吸收谁。三、不站到群众头上耍态度。四、自己有错误要改，对别人有意见要当面提。……
    经过两天酝酿，十一自上午发起人集会讨论“不要谁”“要谁”，分开三号人：一种是毛病大一时改不了的，暂时不要；一种是有毛病决心改掉的，改了就要；一种是没啥大毛病的，立即吸收参加。贫农一参加就算正式团员；新中农经各小组通过后，还要大会通过才算正式团员。
    最初两天，有几组是认为没大毛病就尽量吸收的，有两组把门关的太紧，两天才发展了五、六个人，他们有的是怕“现在看着毛病小，进来了仗凭是个团员了坏起来不得了。”另外几组的发起人就批评说：“大家都看着的进来以后坏了，群众也能叫他出去。”讨论了“不要谁”以后，把和地主走的近的、爱抱小疙瘩的宗派头子、翻古劲大的报复能手、明铺夜盖、宁肯不进贫农团也不肯不腐化的少数人挑出来决定不要之外，各组就都大胆发展起来。暂时放在外边凉了两天的一些人，表现得非常焦急，坐卧不安，这时发起人去找他们谈，他们表示决心改过，就都吸收进来了。进团的时候都作了自我批评，展开相互批评；一批一批发展，一批一批集体讨论，大家审查入会的人。展开了批评与自我批评的热潮，思想提高了一步；同时贫农团队伍组织得也比较快，没有在串连中拖太长的时间。接着就个别串连翻身不久，不过高的，合乎团员条件的新中农，也都在小组上进行了批评与自我批评。到成立大会前一日，共发展了团员二百零九人，里边有贫农一百四十二人，新中农六十七人。
  　结合审查党员　让好党员入团
    在酝酿成立贫农团同时，继续开展民主运动，各组开群众会提出对党员干部的意见，并且选出代表来，到支部扩大会议上当面给党员提意见，帮助整党。十日下午提了半天，晚上虽然下着雨，仍然开会，提意见很踊跃也很有次序。（据群众反映：“过去开会不是乱嚷就是大家都不吭。）因为看到有了自己的组织，群众就减掉了不少顾虑。在发起人的会议上，讨论都是那些人能参加贫农团时，就有人提出：“好党员也要他们参加，他们也是咱贫雇里头的人，只要是好人就让他来。”大家都同意了。贫农团发起人认为可以参加贫农团的党员，就让他们到贫农团小组会上报告自己这几天反省的情形，作了认真的自我批评，和别的团员入团时同样受群众批评审查，而不再特别开审查党员的会。成立大会前，总共有群众公认的十个好党员（有贫农，有新中农），参加了贫农团。贫农成份的加入后就成为正式团员；新中农成份的，在成立大会上又作了一次详细的反省报告，群众也很认真的给提了不少意见。其中王喜堂因为是村长，反省的比较多，群众给提的意见也较多。有些他忘了谈的，群众提出后他又作了补充。其中有些事不是村长应负责的，王喜堂也以实事求是的态度加以解释；群众的态度也是实事求是的，解释后也都说：“很实际，大小的事都谈了，赞成他参加贫农团。”王喜堂表示：“如果因为我在这里大家有话不好说，我就出去吧？”群众嚷着说：“用不着出去啦！”对其他几个人的反省，群众的评语也是：“很实际！”或者“这个人起党员作用起得不够，不过可是个好人！”“就是那一点，他自己也说出来啦，以后改了就行。”
  　注意发动妇女诉苦启发觉悟
    在选出的十六个发起人里面，有三个妇女。封建社会的束缚在她们身上还没有完全解除，她们是劳动好的、正派的、婆媳妯娌邻里关系和睦的，是全村知名的好妇女，但还没有养成办事的能力，能活动的范围不大。工作组也只有一个女同志，所以最初只好通过汉们发展各人家里的妇女。妇女参加各种会时仍然害羞，不敢说话。要她们说话时，说的虽然少，可是大半都是正确的，她们对村里的事情是有眼光的。讨论候选人的条件时，有一个组的妇女首先提出“要穷的、受苦的、从前不敢吭气的”，“正直不偏的，不怕事的”，“不流氓腐化，脸上没漕气的”。选择具体的人的时候，她们选的也都很对。因为她们过去活动的范围小，在有些方面比男的沾染旧社会的坏习惯也较少；她们是能提出正直尖锐意见的。在成立贫农团小组的时候，最初是男女混合编组，后来她们又要求分开。有的男团员说：“分开不好，妇女单独办不成啥事。”而分开以后，妇女在开会时候发言就比较热烈了。贫农妇女有更多的痛苦，她们更迫切要求当家作主；在有的会上妇女发言被她男人阻止，妇女仍然坚决的要说下去。在团员互相审查时，有几个妇女，小组的团员们诉了苦，提高了觉悟，也勇敢地热烈地展开了自我批评与批评，把过去从不肯告人的事也讲了出来。在给党员干部提意见时，妇女也提了意见，批评政治主任强迫一个妇女和他兄弟对象，批评民兵指导员、公安员等流氓腐化；还有一个妇女提出：“公安员把自己老婆打得黑青眼窝，还要别人的老婆都得照他老婆那样子挨打受压迫。我男人也不正派，我跟他吵了架，公安员就说我没心跟男人过，非受处理不可，还对俺男人说：‘我搞腐化，我老婆就管不了我；你就不行！’这样挑拨俺夫妻。妇女们不敢说话就因为这。”
    妇女的思想发动做得还是不够，只不过是有些人开始活动开始说话了。在组织方面发展得还好。贫农团成立时，二十一个小组里面有九个妇女小组，还有两个小组是男女混合的。二百零九个团员里面有八十个妇女，约占五分之二。十五个贫农团委员里，有四个妇女。
  　打破片片主义　反对宗派活动
    据说，在民主政府没成立以前，什里店寨上跟下街时常打架，尤其每年阴历正月十五，上街的闹红火的到了下街，快要玩到南头的时候总要打一场，有时扭到河滩上打起来。民主政府成立后，这情形就没有了。可见这完全是地主从中拨弄的。近些年虽然不打架了，可是总还是不大和谐，这是因为坏干部和少数坏人又利用上了这封建社会遗留下来的东西闹纠纷，从中争权夺利。群众不自觉的感染了这宗派情绪，在选举贫农团发起人的会上又流露出来一些。选举寨上的发起人的时候，三个候选人作了自我批评，其中也确实有两个人缺点较大；忽然有一个下街的人站起来说：“这三个人都不照！寨上怎么选了这三个人来？”寨上的一个老太婆也走出来说：“有缺点的也不是就他三个，我看寨上这几个人就顶好！”………工作员这时就给大家说明：“提意见就只对这个人提，不要分寨上下街。人都有错误，改好了就照。”选举结果，寨上提出的四个人选上了两个，闹宗派的毕竟是少数人，群众还是要求团结的。选举之后，群众嘱咐发起人时就提出：“鼓着劲大家团结就对；今天出了分裂了，弄了两瓣子蒜，就不好了，地主耻笑咱。”“上下街一样，一家人，办的一样工作。寨上酵子根少，回去可好好发展，不要闹分裂。”散会后，看到上街的宗派情绪并没消除，工作员又特别召集上街贫农开会，先让几个爱闹宗派的人发透牢骚。一个最爱闹宗派的说：“分村吧！”又一个人说：“是大村压小村，咱象大家庭的儿媳妇……。”工作员等他们把气发泄差不多了，就给他们分析，使他们认识：“下街还是好人多，平和人多，决不是什么大村压小村，只是少数人不好。以后只许宣传团结，不许宣传分裂，不要叫地主坏人钻了咱贫农的空子。穷苦人那有工夫闹纠纷，在前是地主挑的，以后是坏干部坏人搞的，咱不要上当。人家提咱的缺点，态度虽然不好，有意见提出来还是对的。以后村里事都要贫农带头，咱不带好怎么办？”对下街宗派情绪特别重的一两个人，也进行了教育。工作组也认识到这不能孤立地求得解决，越急于解决，群众越会纠缠在这上面，而妨碍整个运动的正常开展。要在整个运动中注意解决，民主运动开展的好，也就是团结运动。在贫农团、农会的组织上，在团员会员的思想上注意这一问题，群众在运动中就会因为斗争目标的一致而团结起来，从群众整编队伍中，也就可以结成一个整体。在以后的运动中，工作组注意了批评宗派情绪浓厚的少数人，教育了有盲目的宗派情绪的一些人。在选举委员、发展团员时，特别强调不要抱小疙瘩的闹宗派的人。对于一贯闹宗派的极少数人，发起人也注意到了暂不吸收他们入团。这样作的结果，大小宗派活动（如傅、李两姓之间和其他一些结小集团报复人的）基本上都消沉了。但，有的宗派是有历史性、盲目性的，消沉下去并不等于就已经消灭了，今后还需要长期注意克服。
