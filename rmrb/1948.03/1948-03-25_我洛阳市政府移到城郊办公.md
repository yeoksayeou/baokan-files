Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, March 23rd: The Luoyang Democratic Municipal Government, after withdrawing from Luoyang city with the People's Liberation Army on the 18th, has now temporarily moved to the suburbs to work, leading the people of Luoyang to persevere in the struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, March 22nd: A frontline reporter reports: Liu Huandong, Administrative Inspector of the Tenth District of Henan Province under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and Guo Chunfang, the magistrate of Luoyang County, desperately wanted to send a telegram to Liu Maoen for help after the People's Liberation Army completed the encirclement of Luoyang on the 9th, but all the radio operators had already fled. On the evening of the 11th, after the People's Liberation Army suddenly entered the East Gate, Liu and Guo hurriedly took some personnel and wanted to run to the headquarters of the 206th Division, but Qiu Xingxiang refused to let them enter the fortress. Later, after Liu and Guo's bitter pleas, they were allowed to enter, while the rest of the personnel were dispersed. On the 12th, the People's Liberation Army tightened the encirclement, and Liu and Guo spent their days in the basement, half-submerged in water, trembling with fear, eating only one meal in two days. Later, seeing no hope, they secretly changed into plain clothes and fled, but were finally captured alive by the People's Liberation Army on the evening of the 14th. When the People's Liberation Army besieged Luoyang, Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency broadcast that Liu Huandong had "made a will and was determined to live and die with the city." When the reporter talked to him about this, he said it was completely fabricated by the Central News Agency. It is reported that Liu Huandong is from Gong County, Henan Province, and is 67 years old this year. He has served as the county magistrate of Ye County, Xuchang, and Yancheng under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Guo Chunfang is from the northern countryside of Luoyang and is 60 years old this year.

　　我洛阳市政府移到城郊办公
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十三日电】洛阳市民主市政府，十八日随解放军撤出洛阳城后，现暂移至城郊办公，领导洛阳人民坚持斗争。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十二日电】前线记者报导：蒋匪河南省第十区行政督察专员刘焕东、洛阳县长郭春舫，于九日解放军完成对洛阳的包围后，急想拍电向刘茂恩求救，但电台人员都已全部溜逃。十一日晚解放军突入东门后，刘郭两人仓皇带了一部分人员想跑到二○六师师部去，但邱行湘拒绝他们进圩，后来经过刘郭苦苦哀求，才获准他们两人入内，其余人员都被驱散。十二日解放军紧缩包围圈，刘郭两人在地下室里半身浸着水，整日心惊胆战，两天只吃了一餐。后来他们眼看无望，便偷偷换上便衣溜逃，但在十四日晚终被解放军生俘。当解放军围攻洛阳时，蒋匪中央社曾广播刘焕东已“立下遗嘱，决心与城共存亡”。记者跟他谈到这事，他说这完全是中央社的造谣。按刘焕东为河南巩县人，今年六十七岁，曾任蒋匪叶县、许昌、郾城等县县长。郭春舫为洛阳北乡人，现年六十岁。
