Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 17th: Senior Chiang-Hu military officers who laid down their arms in the Yichuan campaign all complained about Hu Zongnan's inept command, which led to the army's complete annihilation. Liu Zhenshi, Chief of Staff of the Hu bandit's 29th Corps, said: "Last October, the 76th Division was annihilated in Qingjian. Hu Zongnan reprimanded Liu Kan for failing to reinforce effectively. This time, he strictly ordered reinforcements to Yichuan, resulting in the entire army being wiped out." Wu Yelu, Chief of the Staff Office of the 90th Division, said: "After the 90th Division was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, it had neither the confidence to fight nor the confidence to break through, and was completely finished after being tossed around." Zhang Hanchu, Brigade Commander of the Hu bandit's 24th Brigade, said: "At 11:00 AM on the 29th, I received a telegram from Liu Kan saying that he was 'advancing aggressively,' and there was no news after that. One day, Hu Zongnan even told me to 'hold on to the death and wait for reinforcements.' But our division commander, Xu Bao, realized the situation was not good on the morning of the 23rd, so he fled to Hancheng. In the afternoon, the People's Liberation Army approached Yichuan City, and the division commander was not here to command, but asked me to 'hold on to the death.' Although Hu Zongnan promised to send planes to transport 30 tons of military supplies for relief, not even five tons landed in the city, and all of it was given to the People's Liberation Army outside the city." These senior officers were all extremely pessimistic and frustrated about the Northwest war situation under Hu Zongnan's command. Li Qiheng, Deputy Division Commander of the 27th Division, said: "This victory of the People's Liberation Army has caused the Northwest situation to take a sharp turn for the worse." A certain Tan, the Adjutant of the 90th Division, put it more succinctly, saying: "You (the People's Liberation Army) can attack Xi'an now!"
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 17th: After the great victory in Yichuan, our army discovered three more senior Hu bandit officers. They include Li Xiuling, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 53rd Brigade of the 90th Division, Wu Yelu, Chief of the Staff Office of the division headquarters, and Fu Ying, Deputy Commander of the Transport Regiment. According to Li Xiuling, Deng Hongyi, Brigade Commander of the brigade, He Yixin, Commander of the 158th Regiment, and Xie Youhao, Deputy Commander of the 157th Regiment, were killed by our forces in the battle. In addition, 17 mortars and 60 mortars, 26 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 1,000 long and short guns were found.

　　宜川被俘蒋匪高级军官埋怨胡匪宗南指挥无能
    【新华社西北十七日电】宜川之役放下武器的蒋胡军高级军官，都埋怨胡宗南指挥无能，落得全军覆没。胡匪整二十九军参谋长刘振世说：“去年十月整七十六师在清涧被歼，胡宗南申斥刘戡增援不力，这次，严令增援宜川，结果是落得个全军覆没。”整九十师师参谋处长吴也鲁说：“九十师被解放军包围后，既无信心战斗，又无信心突围，被摆来摆去全完了”。胡匪整二十四旅旅长张汉初说：“二十九日上午十一时，我接到刘戡的电报说他正在‘攻势前进’，以后就无消息了。一日胡宗南还来叫我‘死守待援’。可是我们的师长徐保，二十三日上午发现情况不妙，他就逃到韩城去了，下午解放军逼近宜川城，师长不在这里指挥，却让我来‘死守’，虽然胡宗南答应派飞机运三十吨军火来接济，结果连五吨也没有落到城内，全送给城外的解放军了”。这些高级军官都对胡宗南指挥下的西北战局异常悲观沮丧，整二十七师副师长李奇亨说：“解放军这一胜利，已使西北局势急转直下”。整九十师副官处长谭某讲得更简捷，他说：“你们（解放军）可以打西安啦！”
    【新华社西北十七日电】宜川大捷后，我军又查出胡匪高级军官三名。计有整九十师五十三旅副旅长李秀岭，该师师部参谋处长吴也鲁及输送团副团长傅英。据李秀岭称，该旅旅长邓宏仪，一五八团团长何怡新，一五七团副团长谢友灏等三人，已在战斗中被我击毙。此外又查出迫击炮、六○炮共十七门，轻重机枪二十六挺，长短枪一千余支。
