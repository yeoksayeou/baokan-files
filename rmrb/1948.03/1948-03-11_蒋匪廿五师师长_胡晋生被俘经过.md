How Chiang Kai-shek's Bandit 25th Division Commander
    Hu Jinsheng Was Captured

　　After the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's bandit 25th Division, a great deal of effort was expended in the prisoner of war group to try and identify the division commander, Hu Jinsheng; it wasn't until the latter half of the night of the 21st of last month, that a sentry from one of our units stationed on North 6th Road, Zhongshan Road, Anshan, suddenly saw a cart driver approaching. The soldier shouted, "Who's there?" The reply came, "One of us, driving a cart." The soldier, hearing the southern accent, ordered him to halt. Seeing that the situation was not good, the man hastily threw a small package behind him and took off running. The soldier immediately chased after him and wrestled him down. The two began to fight. At that moment, another soldier who had just finished his shift happened to walk by and, seeing that something was wrong, fired a shot into the air. The man immediately begged for mercy and surrendered. The soldiers picked up the items he had thrown away and took them to the company headquarters. Under the light, they opened it and found a wallet containing the identification papers of the 25th Division commander.

　　"Are you a cart driver?" the company political instructor asked. Hu Jinsheng's face was as yellow as wax, and he said, panting, "No, I am a major adjutant from the division headquarters. The documents in the wallet are for safekeeping for the division commander." At this point, the company political instructor understood about 80 or 90 percent of the situation and explained the People's Liberation Army's policy on prisoners of war in detail to him. After listening, Hu Jinsheng changed his tone and said, "I am Hu Jinsheng, commander of the 25th Division." Then, Hu Jinsheng sighed deeply and said, with his head lowered, "The soldiers are fighting on empty stomachs. Before you (referring to the People's Liberation Army) even entered the city, some people in the ranks were already firing black guns. My brothers had already surrendered to you. Only I was left, and there was no reinforcement. It's too late!" He was clearly very agitated and then, talking to himself, he angrily said in the direction of Shenyang, "I don't know what you are sitting around doing? I sent a telegram in the first month, and you telegraphed back saying that reinforcements would arrive in ten days, telling me to hold out for reinforcements. Where are the reinforcements?"

　　On the 19th of last month, when our army launched a general attack on the city of Anshan, Chiang's aircraft dropped over 30 parachutes, all of which were captured by our army. One of them contained apples, sweets, plain clothes, etc., and a personal letter from Hu Jinsheng's wife, Ms. Ji Fan: "I heard that the outskirts of Anshan City are surrounded by 'bandits' layer upon layer... Now that you are in a passive and unsupported situation, it is inevitable that there is a risk of internal mutiny... I am filled with worry and have been fasting for you. I specially asked Blind Zhang of this city (Shenyang) to tell your fortune. According to him, in the northern direction of Anshan City, you are likely to be ambushed, and you will definitely be captured on the 19th and 21st... After hearing this, Ji Fan almost fainted. I am specially sending plain clothes, a plain hat, and underwear for your use when necessary." Hu's wife then described how, in her grief and "mental collapse," she ran to the "Great Sage Hall to draw a lot," but the oracle also said, "More bad luck than good," and she "almost fainted again." Fortunately, an old Taoist priest drew a talisman for her and instructed her to "enclose it in the letter, and if you have no other choice, take the letter and seek refuge in the big temple in that city (Anshan), so that you may be saved." In fact, neither "reinforcements" nor "talismans" could save Hu Jinsheng. Becoming a prisoner of war was his only way out. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　蒋匪廿五师师长
    胡晋生被俘经过
    当解放军全歼蒋匪军廿五师以后，在俘虏群里费了很大的劲也没清查出该师师长胡晋生；直到上月二十一日的下半夜，我驻鞍山中山路北六道街的某部放哨的战士，忽然看见一个赶大车的人迎面而来，该战士喊道：“哪个”？对面答：“自己人，赶大车的”。战士一听是南方口音，就命令他站住，那人见势不妙，慌忙把一小包东西向后一扔，撒腿就跑，战士立即追上去把他扭住，两个人于是就撕打起来；这时恰好又走来一个刚下哨的战士，看情形不对头，就“砰”的朝天放了一枪，那人才连声求饶，束手就缚。战士将他扔掉的东西拾起来，一齐送到连部里去。在灯光下，把它打开一看，原是一个皮夹，里面藏着二十五师师长的证件。
    “你是赶大车的吗”？连指导员问。胡晋生的脸孔象黄腊一般，喘着粗气说：“不，我是师部的少校副官，皮夹里的证件，是替师长保管的”。这时连指导员的心里已明白了个八九，就详细的向他解释解放军的俘虏政策。胡晋生听了之后，才改变了口气说：“我就是二十五师师长胡晋生”。接着胡晋生长叹一声，低垂着头喃喃的说：“士兵们饿着肚子打仗，没等你们（指解放军）进城，队伍里就有人打黑枪，我弟兄们早已投降你们了，只剩下我一个人，又没援兵，晚了晚了！”他的精神显然十分激动，接着他又自言自语的朝着沈阳的方向愤愤的说：“不知你们坐着干什么？头一个月就拍电报去，你们来电说援兵十天就可赶到，要我坚守待援，援兵在那儿呢？”
    上月十九日，当我军向鞍山城发动总攻后，蒋机投下卅余个降落伞，都被我军缴获。其中有一个内装苹果、糖、便衣等，并有胡晋生太太际范女士寄来的一封亲笔信：“闻鞍山市外围有‘匪’层层包围………今兄处于被动无援之下，难免不无内变之险，……愁肠万绪，为君斋戒，特请本市（沈阳）张瞎子为兄卜卦，据云在鞍市北面方向，恐受敌伏击，十九与二十一两日，绝对会被俘………际范闻言之后，几欲昏倒，特寄便衣、便帽及内衣内裤，以备必要时之需用”。胡妻接着叙述她在“神魂填倒”的悲痛中，又跑往“大圣馆去求签”，不料签词亦云：“凶多吉少”，又“几欲昏倒”。此时幸亏有位老道替她划了一道符咒，嘱她“附于信内，于不得已时，请你持信向该市（鞍山）大庙中投奔，方可得救。”其实“援军”、“符咒”这都救不了胡晋生，只有当了俘虏，才是他唯一的生路。（新华社）
