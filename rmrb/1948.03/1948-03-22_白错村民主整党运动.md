The Democratic Party Rectification Movement in Baicuo Village

　　Baicuo Village in Shahe has 234 households and 964 people. As soon as the work team arrived in the village, they dispersed for meals and sleep, immersing themselves in the masses to interview poor peasants and hired laborers. After two days, they discovered Yang Qi, who had not yet been emancipated, and had just returned from Xingtai. When talking about his emancipation, he began to complain. He said that he had returned home three times to request emancipation, but the village cadres not only did not allow him to, but also said that he had not returned home for many years, leaving seven points of paddy field without paying public grain, and ordered him to use it to offset the debt. They also gave his nine dilapidated houses to a household that had been struggled against. After he finished complaining, he was asked how many people were like him, but he couldn't say. The work team couldn't figure out the village's emancipation situation, so they became depressed.

　　Not Adapting to the Demands of the Masses, the Work Began to Feel Depressed

　　On the fourth day, after reviewing and researching, the work team decided to combine the majority and individual interviews. First, one person would specialize in understanding the burden accounts, checking the output and the amount of land occupied by each class. Second, one person would cooperate externally, visiting the masses to report their own emancipation situation and output. Third, one person would be responsible for branch work, understanding the situation of the branch. Fourth, two people would conduct in-depth reviews of the composition of the poor peasant association, while also paying attention to mobilizing women.

　　After two days, the results of the review showed that there were 63 original members of the poor peasant association, 20 who had been emancipated and risen, 31 who had been emancipated at the same level, and 12 who had not been thoroughly emancipated. Immediately, these 12 households that had not been emancipated were organized into groups, and 8 women were also found and educated. Relying on these 20 backbones, and after communicating with 37 people, they closed the door. This caused unease among the new middle peasants, and the old middle peasants waited to be struggled against. For example, Hao Tonglong felt like he was getting a bargain, because he saw the cadres were meeting and the poor peasants were also meeting, and no one called him to the meeting, and he didn't dare to go, without knowing the bottom line. On the other hand, the poor peasants also suspected the work team, wondering what kind of meeting the old cadres were holding. In this situation, the work team became depressed again, and after another review and research, they identified these problems: First, they did not determine the type of village according to the situation, and the work became a matter of course. Second, they did not express their attitude to the masses, and the masses suspected the work team. Third, they only looked for a few poor peasants and hired laborers, and the poor peasants and hired laborers became isolated. After the review, they used the output account as a basis to conduct a preliminary study of class division, and decided on the direction of the village's work, relying on the un-emancipated poor peasants and hired laborers to unite the middle peasants and carry out the democratic movement in conjunction with party rectification. In order to unite the middle peasants, class education was carried out, and the poor peasant groups also eagerly requested to unite the middle peasants, organizing the upright middle peasants. Their slogan was that more people make things easier. At this time, it became a universal demand of the masses for the work team to express its attitude. On the 23rd of the old calendar, a village-wide farmers' meeting was held (excluding the struggle households), and the comrades of the work team explained the policies in detail at the meeting, and the masses were in high spirits after the meeting. The general reflection was: "It's all for democracy, we have the right to speak!"

　　Party Rectification and Democracy Go Hand in Hand, Ideological Struggle Unfolds Within the Party

　　At this time, the work team took the action of launching the masses to rectify the party and the democratic movement in parallel. The 37 poor peasants were divided into groups, and they all took the attitude of initiators of the new peasant association, communicating with each other for review and introduction. Their review was very serious. For example, Zhao San had a bit of a hooligan air. He was passed in the group, but not passed at the general meeting (reviewed by three groups together), and was criticized severely. Zhao San felt embarrassed to be called up to make trouble, and the introducer also felt bored. They reviewed and decided to first study the person being introduced, and then approve him after individual talks or setting conditions before introducing him to participate. After three days, 147 households were organized, 120 men and 72 women, and the meeting became larger and larger, and everyone's enthusiasm gradually increased.

　　At this time, the work team had more information and more specific teaching materials for branch education, mobilizing party members to review themselves. This branch had 20 party members, including 6 from poor peasant backgrounds, 6 hired laborers, 5 middle peasants, and 3 lower-middle peasants. The main problems were that the old party members' style was extremely undemocratic, selfishly occupying more fruits, engaging in corruption, and sheltering struggle targets. Those with big mistakes did not dare to reflect, fearing that they would be punished and brought to the people's court if they spoke out. The work team first strived for those with small mistakes to review and reflect and put down their burdens, and then launched mutual criticism in the branch, isolating those with big mistakes. The leadership also proposed that admitting and correcting mistakes was the only way out.

　　On the morning of the 26th (old calendar), the poor peasant groups elected Yang Qi and Hao Xiaoniu as representatives to attend the meeting in the branch. These two representatives saw that the branch was conducting criticism and self-criticism seriously, and also put forward four opinions. Several party members with big mistakes felt the pressure from the masses, and couldn't help but be more honest in their reflections. These two representatives returned to the masses and quickly spread the news of this party rectification to the masses. He said that this rectification was really good, which also dispelled the masses' concerns, and they all demanded to speak out their grievances. The next day, they elected 36 representatives to participate in the branch meeting. The comrades of the work team explained to them that they not only welcomed everyone to give opinions to the party members and help rectify the party, but also wanted them to review them. This news quickly spread, greatly inspiring their democratic enthusiasm, and they excitedly said: We can also reason with them. However, the masses' thinking was to try it out first, and proposed to first give opinions to the non-party cadres. At their request, a general meeting was held, and the masses gave opinions to the eight non-party cadres for a day and a half. After the meeting, they also made a review, believing that the speeches were not universal. This gave the masses a chance to practice.

　　Party Members Reflect, Admit and Correct Mistakes, the Masses' Eyes Are Bright and Merits and Demerits Are Clear

　　That night, the list of party members was announced. Immediately, someone proposed to call them to the general meeting to answer to everyone. Yang Qi and Guo Yulai (poor peasants) expressed their opinions, saying: We can't treat these 20 party members the same way, let's discuss it in groups! As a result of the discussion, it was proposed that there were 5 people with big mistakes, 6 with medium mistakes, and 9 with small mistakes, and their opinions were all focused on those with big mistakes. Then the party members entered the venue. The director of the farmers' association was the one the masses were most dissatisfied with. The masses called him to reflect first. He first expressed his history, being a hired laborer for many years, becoming a militiaman after liberation, and becoming the director during the struggle, he forgot his roots and didn't care about everyone. My family has eight people, and the average house in our village is three rooms per person, but I occupy 32 rooms. He also said part of the things he embezzled, but not completely.

　　Hired laborer Wu Dashuan said: Chou Dan, you and I are in the same boat, we suffered together for landlords, we were partners. After you became a cadre, you forgot the suffering of the poor, and the whole venue had 14 poor peasants giving opinions (not many middle peasants spoke). The general meeting lasted from after dinner until two o'clock, and everyone forgot to sleep.

　　The next day, the general meeting continued. After the head of the cooperative, Hu Xiaolai, reflected, more than 30 women complained to him. Among them, seven were crying while complaining, such as Hao Yu'e, who said: Brother Laini, you are a party member! Our chairman (referring to Chairman Mao) asked you to speak the truth and handle affairs fairly. Last year when we distributed the fruits, the party members were given good foreign cloth, and I was given a piece of rotten cloth, which broke as soon as I moved it. I said a word of unfairness in my family, and you heard it, and you hated me for it. Every time there was a meeting, you said in the general meeting that I was backward, selfish, and sabotaging the work, which scared me all year round. Later, I asked my man to apologize to you and say good things before it was over.

　　Hao Zeng, Hao Lintang, Wang Ting and other nine party members with small mistakes also made reflections one by one. For example, the women's team leader Wang Ting said: "When I became a cadre, I became arrogant. When organizing weaving, I only disliked the thread spun by the women from poor families, which is where I looked down on the poor." The masses said: "She did it for work, she has never oppressed anyone in the village, good! good! It's nothing! It's nothing!" So these nine were passed one by one. The general meeting lasted for three days and three evenings. From the meeting, it can be seen that the masses are clear about merits and demerits, and their class stand is clear.

　　Later, the masses were allowed to review the party members, and each group first discussed the conditions for party members. Yang Qi said: Being a communist party member is not simple. You have to work all year round, be upright, be at the forefront of everything, and break the emotional face, and be active in the struggle. They proposed: An upright peasant counts as sixteen taels, and a communist party member must be twenty taels. We are like a steelyard, and these twenty party members must all be weighed on our steelyard.

　　At this time, every party member was nervous in their thinking, and truly experienced the power of the masses. First, the director of the farmers' association, Hao Chou Dan, was reviewed. Li Xibao said: Your composition is very good, but what you have done is not good. We don't deny your contributions. You have contributed in the struggle, but you have also occupied a lot of fruits, and you have also been messing around with women, not working yourself, and only asking the struggle households to do work for you. This is not what the Communist Party asked you to do! It's your own idea! Someone else said: You are a party member, you understand party rules (party discipline is called party rules), I am not a party member, I don't understand party rules, I don't think it's calling you to do these bad things! Everyone called Chou Dan to answer whether the opinions raised were correct or not. Chou Dan broke out in a cold sweat and said very shamefully: The party called me to learn to be good, not to learn to be bad...

　　Then, the secretary of the branch, Han Tongxi, was asked to protect the landlord and embezzle the fruits, and asked him to reflect carefully. At the same time, Hao Maocheng and Hu Chengui were criticized and advised. Zhao Cheng said: You two are not bad people, you don't achieve anything or do anything bad, you are peaceful people, you are about the same as me, you also count as sixteen taels. But party members have to be more active! What good role have you played? Maocheng and Chengui expressed their attitude to the masses, saying: I didn't do well before, but in the future I will be a good long-term worker for the masses.

　　Finally, when it came to the seven party members of Hu Lintang and Hu Zeng, the masses discussed and said: Saying you are twenty taels is still a little short, saying eighteen taels is a little more. After review, the masses warmly pulled these people into the new farmers' association, asking them to do things, and those with big mistakes continued to reflect. (Baicuo Village Work Team)

　　白错村民主整党运动
    沙河白错村是二百三十四户的村子，九百六十四口人。工作组一到该村，即分散吃饭睡觉，一头钻在群众里访问贫雇，经两天时间，才发现未翻身的杨七的，他是才从邢台回来。谈到翻身情况，他就诉起苦来，他说：他曾经三次回家要求翻身，村干部不但不让他翻身，反说他多年没回家，留下七分水地没出公粮，叫他抵帐，并把他丢的九间破房子也给了被斗户。他把苦诉完后，问他象你这样的人还有几个，他也说不出啥来。工作组对村里的翻身情况也没法摸清楚，就苦闷起来。
  　没有适应群众要求　工作开始感到苦闷
    第四天，工作组经检讨研究，决定抓多数和个别访问结合起来。一、一人去专门了解负担帐，查产量和各阶层占有土地数。二、一人在外围配合，访群众自报自己的翻身情况和产量。三、一人负责支部工作，了解支部的情况。四、二人深入审查贫农团的成份，同时注意发动妇女。
    经过两天时间，审查的结果，原有贫农团六十三人，翻身翻高的二十人，翻身平的三十一人，翻身不透的十二人。随即把这十二户没翻身的人组织成小组，同时又找到八个妇女，进行教育。依靠这二十个骨干，串通了三十七人后，便关起门来。因而引起新中农不安，老中农等待挨斗。如郝同龙便认为吃了一顿便宜一顿，因为他见干部在开会，贫农也在开会，自己想在会没人来叫，自己又不敢去，不摸底。另方面贫农对工作组也有怀疑，不知道老干部开的啥会。在这种情况下，工作组又苦闷起来了，便又作了检讨与研究，找出这几个问题：一、没有根据情况，确定该村类型，工作形成自流。二、没有向群众表明态度，群众对工作组怀疑。三、只找少数贫雇，贫雇形成孤立。检讨后，拿产量帐作为基础，进行划阶级的初步研究，决定该村工作方向，依靠没翻透身的贫雇，由他们再去团结中农，开展民主运动结合整党。为了团结中农，就进行了阶级教育，贫农组也迫切要求团结中农，把正派的中农组织起来。他们的口号是人多好办事。这时候要工作组表明态度成了群众普遍的要求。在旧历二十三日，就召开了全村农民大会（斗争户不在内），工作组同志在大会上详细的解释政策，会后群众情绪都很高。总的反映是：“都是为了民主，咱有说话权哩！”
  　整党民主双管齐下　党内展开思想斗争
    这时工作组采取发动群众整党与民主运动双管齐下的行动。三十七个贫农分成组，他们都拿起新农会发起人的态度，就串通起来，互相审查介绍，他们的审查十分严肃。如赵三的有点流氓习气，在小组通过了，大会上没有通过（三个组伙审查），乱批评了一顿。赵三的觉得叫我上来闹丢人，介绍人也觉没趣。他们就检讨，决定以后首先把被介绍人研究一下，再经个别谈或订条件批准后，才介绍叫他参加。经过三天，串通组织起一百四十七户，男一百二十人，女七十二人，会越来越大，大家情绪逐步提高。
    这时工作组了解材料比较多了，对支部教育有了具体教材，动员党员检讨自己。这个支部共二十个党员，内有贫农出身的六个，雇工六个，中农五个，下中农三个。主要问题是老党员作风极不民主，自私多占果实，搞腐化，包庇斗争对象。错误大的不敢反省，怕说出来受处分上人民法庭。工作组首先争取错误小的检讨反省放下包袱，后在支部展开相互批评，使错误大的陷于孤立，领导上又提出认错改错才是出路。
    二十六日上午（旧历），贫农组选出杨七的、郝小牛二人为代表到支部内听会。这两个代表见支部严肃进行批评与自我批评，也提出了四条意见。几个错误较大的党员，感到群众压力，不说也不行，就对反省老实一点。这两个代表回到群众中，把这次整党的事很快传播到群众中去。他说这次整的真不错，这样又解除了群众的顾虑，都要求诉苦。第二天他们又推选了三十六个代表，要求去参加支部会，工作组同志给他们说明不但欢迎大家给党员提意见，帮助整党，还要你们来审查他们。这消息很快传播下去，又大大启发了他们的民主情绪，兴奋的说：咱还能给他们说说理哩。但群众的思想是先试试看，提出先向非党员干部提意见。在他们要求下，就开大会，对八个非党干部，群众一直提了一天半意见。会后他们又作了检讨，认为发言不普遍。这样给了群众一个锻炼。
  　党员反省认错改错　群众眼亮功过分明
    当天晚上，宣布党员名单。当下有人提出叫他们来大会给大家答复答复。杨七的、郭雨来（贫农）发表意见说：这二十个党员咱可不能一律看待，分组酝酿酝酿呀！酝酿的结果，提出错误大的五人、中等错的六人，错误不大的九人，他们的意见都集中在错大的身上。接着党员入会场，农会主任是群众最不满意的一人，群众叫他先反省，他首先表了自己的历史，多年雇工出身，解放后当民兵，斗争时当了主任，就忘了本，不管大家。我八口人，咱村每人平均三间房子，我就占了三十二间，又把自己贪污东西说了一部分，但不完全。
    雇工武大拴说：丑旦咱二人是一榜人，在一块给地主受过苦，搁过伙计，你当了干部后就忘了穷人苦啦，全会场提意见的有十四个贫农（中农发言不多），大会从晚饭后一直开到下两点，都忘了睡觉。
    第二天大会继续开，合作社长胡小来反省后，有三十多个妇女都向他诉苦。内有七个都是一面诉一面哭，如郝玉娥说：来妮哥，你是党员哩！咱主席（指毛主席）叫你给说真理，办公道事咧。在去年分果实时，党员分的都是好洋布，给俺一块烂布，一动就坏，俺在俺家说了一句不公道，被你听见，你就对俺有了恨气，一开会就在大会说俺落后、自私、破坏工作，吓得俺成年没法。后来叫俺男人给你赔了错，说了好话才算完事。
    郝增的、郝林堂、王廷的等九个错小的党员，也一一做了检讨。如妇女队长王廷的说：“我自己当了干部，就自高自大。组织纺织时，我光嫌贫人家妇女纺的线不好，这是我看不起穷人的地方。”群众说：“她是为了工作，在村没有压迫过一个人，好！好！没啥！没啥！”就把这九个一一通过去。大会进行了三天三黄昏，从会中，看出群众对功过的分明，阶级立场是明确的。
    以后让群众审查党员，先各小组酝酿党员条件。杨七的说：当个共产党员不是简单的，常年劳动还得人气正派，样样在前，还得打破情面，斗争积极。他们提出：一个正派农民算十六两，共产党员就得够二十两，咱们好比一杆秤，这二十个党员都得过一过咱的秤。
    这时每个党员思想上都紧张起来，真正体会了群众力量。首先审查农会主任郝丑旦。李喜保说：你成份很好，你作的事可不好。我们也不昧你的功劳。你在斗争中出过力气，可是你多占的果实也不少，又搞女人，自己不劳动光叫斗争户给你做活，这不是共产党叫你干的！是你自己的主意罢！又有人说：你是党员哩，你懂党规（党的纪律叫做党规），俺不是党员，俺不懂党规，大约不是叫你做这坏事的吧！大家叫丑旦答复提的意见对不对，丑旦出了一身大汗，很惭愧的说：党叫我学好来，没叫我学坏……。
    接着向支书韩同喜提出包庇地主贪污果实，叫他好好反省。同时又向郝毛成、胡臣贵提出批评建议。赵成说：你二人人气不差，也不成事也不坏事，是个平和人，你和俺差不多，也算十六两。可是党员都得积极点哩！你起过啥好作用？毛成、臣贵向群众表示态度说：我以前没干好，今后要给群众当个好长工。
    最后提到胡林堂、胡增的七个党员，群众酝酿着说：说你们够二十两还少差点，说十八两多一点。经过审查，群众就亲亲热热的把这几个拉到新农会里，叫给他们办事，错误大的继续反省。（白错村工作组）
