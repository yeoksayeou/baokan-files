　　Brief News of Students in the Chiang Kai-shek Area
    ▲The student unions of six universities in Beiping, namely Tsinghua University, Normal University, Peking University, Chaoyang University, Sino-French University, and Yenching University, issued a letter to the public on the 24th of last month, condemning the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for allocating only 0.3% of their total budget to education this year.
    ▲After the opening of private middle schools in Beiping, the number of students has sharply decreased compared to the previous semester due to the inability to afford the huge tuition fees. The number of students in a certain middle school in Xicheng has decreased by one-third compared to the previous semester. When the school recruited students during the winter vacation, very few candidates applied. There were only ten applicants the first time and eight the second time.
    ▲Under the exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, more than half of the students in private middle schools in Baoding are unable to pay for their meals.
    ▲In mid-last month, Soochow University, University of Shanghai, and St. John's University in Shanghai jointly launched a movement to rescue out-of-school youth, carrying out activities such as fundraising, charity sales, and entertainment to help poor students pay their tuition fees.
