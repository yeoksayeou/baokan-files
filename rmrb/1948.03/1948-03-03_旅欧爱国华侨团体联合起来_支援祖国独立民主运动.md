　　Overseas Chinese Patriotic Groups in Europe Unite
  　To Support the National Independence and Democratic Movement of the Motherland
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Delayed news from Hong Kong: Overseas Chinese groups in Britain, France, and other places initiated the organization of the "Overseas Chinese Peace and Democracy Promotion Association in Europe" on October 10th last year, and issued a declaration calling on all patriotic overseas Chinese in Europe to unite and support the national independence, democratic and peaceful movement of the motherland. Participants in the initiation included: the General Association of Chinese Laborers Who Participated in the War in France, the Overseas Chinese Peace Promotion Association in France, the London Democratic Front, the London Republican Society, the Liverpool Chinese Seamen's Mutual Aid Association, and six other groups. The declaration denounced the Jiang bandits for undermining the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, engaging in civil war, and seeking foreign aid through selling out the country, allowing American imperialism to plunder all sovereignty of China. It then pointed out: "The Twenty-One Demands signed with Japan by Yuan Shikai and the traitor Wang Jingwei's treasonous treaty are not as thorough as the current Kuomintang reactionary regime's sell-out of the country." "The combination of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary regime is the only enemy of the Chinese people." The declaration finally called on all patriotic overseas Chinese in Europe to participate in the association regardless of party affiliation or belief, to support compatriots in the Jiang-controlled areas oppressed by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and to jointly strive to achieve the goal of Chinese peace and democracy.

　　旅欧爱国华侨团体联合起来
  　支援祖国独立民主运动
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】香港迟到消息：旅英、法等地华侨团体，于去年十月十日发起组织“旅欧华侨和平民主促成会”，并发表宣言号召全欧的爱国侨胞，联合起来支援祖国的独立、民主和平运动。参加发起者计有：旅法参战华工总会、旅法华侨和平促进会、伦敦民主阵线、伦敦共和社、利物浦中国海员互助会等六团体。宣言中痛斥蒋匪破坏政协决议，进行内战，并卖国求援，让美帝掠夺中国一切主权。继即指出：“袁世凯对日本签订的二十一条，和汉奸汪精卫的卖国条约，还不及现在国民党反动政权卖国卖得彻底。”“美帝和国民党反动政权的结合，是中国人民唯一的敌人”。宣言最后号召：全欧的爱国侨胞，应不分党派、不问信仰的参加该会，声援被美帝和国民党反动政权压迫的蒋管区同胞，共同为实现中国和平民主的目的而奋斗。
