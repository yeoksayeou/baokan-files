Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th: Our army in Shandong is earnestly protecting industry and commerce, and newly liberated cities are restoring order.
　　Along the Jiaoji Railway, democratic order is being established in newly liberated cities. The Boshan Shentou and Xihe power plants have continued to generate electricity without interruption since the People's Liberation Army entered the city. The Yanshan Iron Factory and the Glass Factory resumed production on the 19th. A branch of the Beihai Bank has been established in the city to exchange Beihai currency for Chiang currency at a rate of one to fifty. The Beihai currency is now circulating in the city. The democratic government has allocated 20,000 catties of millet and 4,000 catties of wheat to relieve the poor and workers, and has mobilized farmers from the old liberated areas to sell grain in the city. Grain prices have fallen rapidly. On the 16th, millet was 60,000 (Beihai currency, same below) yuan per斗, and on the 18th it fell to 52,000 yuan. The government also held a symposium with merchants to explain the policy of protecting industry and commerce and free trade. Shops have also opened one after another, and prices are gradually stabilizing. After the liberation of Zhoucun city, all obstacles in the streets have been cleared. The electric light company is being repaired. After the democratic government issued a proclamation to protect industry and commerce and abolish exorbitant taxes and levies, shops that had been squeezed and closed down by Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the past are now reorganizing and resuming business. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce has also sold thousands of catties of salt at low prices to supply the citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 27th: After a unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived in Gaoyuan and Zhangzhuang, representatives of the masses from Changshan, Zouping, Zhoucun and other places came from afar to accuse Chiang Kai-shek bandits of bloody crimes, demanding that the People's Liberation Army immediately avenge them. The representatives recounted many inhuman atrocities committed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth lunar month last year, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits went to Changyuzhuang in the fifth district of Changshan County and arrested more than 200 people. More than 20 people were killed on the spot, and more than 60 people were buried alive after being taken to Zhoucun. Liu Hongfang, a poor man from Daliu Village in the district, was tied up and fed to dogs, and half of his body was gnawed off. Liu Hongze's eighty-year-old mother hid on the kang, but was stabbed through the head with a bayonet by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Women and children who were captured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to build fortifications on the HuanTai city wall witnessed corpses with heads, hands, or feet exposed around the city wall, all of whom were kind people who were killed or buried alive by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Aunt Liu from Dongyongzhuang fell to the ground and cried, accusing Chiang Kai-shek's bandits of killing all the cadres in Liujing Village. A seventeen-year-old girl was also stripped naked, gang-raped, and tied to a tree with her breasts cut off. After hearing this, the soldiers were filled with indignation and gritted their teeth, unanimously declaring: The people are our parents, we must be filial to the people, kill the enemy and avenge them.

    【新华社华东前线二十八日电】胶济沿线各新解放城市，建立民主秩序。博山神头与西河两发电厂，在解放军入城后发电一直没有间断，颜山铁工厂及璃玻厂已于十九日恢复生产。该城并已成立北海银行分行，以北海币兑换蒋币，比价为一比五十，现北海币已在市内流通。民主政府为救济贫民和工人特拨出小米两万斤及麦子四千斤，并动员老解放区农民进城卖粮，粮价迅速下降，十六日小米每斗六万（北海币下同）元，十八日即降至五万二千元。政府并召开商民座谈会，解释保护工商业及自由贸易政策，商店亦纷纷开门营业，物价渐趋稳定。周村市解放后，街市间障碍已全部清除。电灯公司正在修复中。民主政府颁布保护工商业废除苛捐杂税布告后，过去为蒋匪压榨倒闭的商店亦正重新整理恢复营业。工商局并以低价发售食盐数千斤供应市民。
    【新华社华东前线二十七日电】解放军某部开到高苑、于张庄后，群众代表自长山、邹平、周村各地远道赶来控诉蒋匪血腥罪行，要求解放军立即替他们报仇。代表们历述蒋匪许多惨绝人道的暴行。去年腊月二十七日蒋匪到了长山县五区常玉庄抓捕群众二百余人，当场杀了二十多人，带到周村后又活埋了六十多人。该区大刘村贫民刘洪方被绑起来喂狗，整个身子被啃去半截。刘洪泽八十多岁的老娘躲在炕上被蒋匪用刺刀刺通了脑袋。被蒋匪抓去修筑桓台城墙工事的妇女儿童们目睹城墙周围地上有露出一个头的，露出一只手或一只脚的尸体，都是被蒋匪杀害或活埋的善良群众。董永庄刘大娘倒在地上，哭诉蒋匪杀害刘景村全村干部，一个十七岁的大姑娘也被剥光衣服轮奸后绑在树上割了奶子。战士们听了后激愤填膺咬牙切齿，一致宣称：老百姓是我们的爹娘，我们要为人民尽孝，杀敌复仇。
