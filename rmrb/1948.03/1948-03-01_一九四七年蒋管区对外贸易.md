Foreign Trade in the KMT-Controlled Areas in 1947
Huang @
The foreign trade in the KMT-controlled areas over the past year marks a further deepening of the colonial nature of the economy in these areas.

According to monthly figures released by the KMT customs, the total value of imports in the KMT-controlled areas last year was 100,680 billion KMT currency, and the total value of exports was 63,765 billion KMT currency, resulting in a total annual trade deficit of 43,046 billion KMT currency. Converted to US dollars on a monthly basis, imports were approximately US$449 million, and exports were approximately US$220 million, with the total annual trade deficit being approximately 100%, or US$220 million. This is nearly a three-fold increase compared to the pre-war annual trade deficit of US$59 million in 1935. Compared to 1946, the trade deficit appears to have been reduced by half (as the trade deficit reached over US$400 million the previous year), but the phenomenon of smuggling into the area has developed on an unprecedented scale over the past year. Rising prices of American goods, and particularly the decline in purchasing power in the KMT-controlled areas, are also contributing factors. Looking at each month separately, the trade deficit situation is extremely unbalanced due to seasonal and other factors. From January to November, the general trade deficit ratio was above 100%, with the largest trade deficit in September, nearly 400%, and the smallest in May, just over 25%. November was also smaller, with a trade deficit of less than 8%, while December saw a trade surplus of just over 18%. Looking at the overall trend, due to increasingly rampant smuggling, the volume of formal import and export trade has become increasingly deformed and declining. Comparing the second half of last year with the first half, the total value of exports has decreased from over US$120 million to over US$108 million, a decrease of 11%; the total value of imports has decreased from over US$240 million in the first half of the year to over US$207 million in the second half of the year, a decrease of 14%.

The astonishing scale of smuggling in the KMT-controlled areas last year has constantly caused panic and fear among national industrial circles. Even the KMT's Central Daily News had to admit that it had surpassed the world-shocking large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods before the War of Resistance. Although the exact figures for smuggling are impossible to determine, it is generally estimated that Guangzhou and Shanghai account for a very large proportion. According to a magazine in Beiping, smuggled exports are generally estimated to be about one-sixth of formal exports. This shows that the trade deficit from smuggling is even worse than that from formal trade.

Furthermore, analyzing the content of import and export commodities, the colonial nature of the KMT-controlled areas in foreign trade is also clearly manifested. Last year, the ratio of exports of industrial raw materials to imports of manufactured industrial products in the KMT-controlled areas increased even more compared to previous years. Looking at the commodity items of foreign trade in September of last year published by the KMT Customs, about 80% of exports were raw materials, while manufactured industrial products and consumer goods accounted for 70% of imports. This is clearly worse than the situation before the war in 1936, when raw material exports accounted for about 58% of the total and manufactured industrial products and consumer goods imports accounted for about 44%. The smuggling situation is the same. For example, in the first half of last year, the main smuggled goods seized by customs at major ports in the KMT-controlled areas were cigarettes, paints, flour, milk powder, canned food, cosmetics, woolen goods, and rayon, while the vast majority of smuggled exports were raw materials such as rice, soybeans, salt, tungsten sand, and tin ingots.

Last year, the United States remained the largest importer in the KMT-controlled areas. According to figures published by the Wall Street Journal, a US financial magnate, in August last year, the average monthly US exports to China in the first half of last year were over US$20 million, accounting for more than half of all imports. It is clear from this that the largest portion of the blood and sweat money paid by the people of the KMT-controlled areas in trade deficits and smuggling deficits last year was plundered by US imperialism. In addition, although US imperialists mainly provided aid to Chiang's military through the transfer of surplus materials and credit loans, they still made huge profits in sporadic paid military trade transactions. According to estimates by a magazine in Beiping, in addition to formal trade, the Foreign Exchange of the KMT bandit Resources Committee purchased last year for military supplies alone, accounted for more than US$130 million. This foreign exchange profit almost entirely fell into the hands of US arms tycoons, and this is precisely one of the purposes of US imperialism in actively encouraging the KMT bandits to carry out the anti-people civil war and cruelly slaughter the Chinese people.

In the past year, US imperialism has also actively expanded trade relations between Japan, which is occupied by the United States, and the KMT-controlled areas. The KMT bandit gang, through the form of "barter," supplied Japan with raw materials such as Chinese salt, iron, and soybeans, and assisted in the continued dumping of Japanese goods in China. According to news from KMT-controlled newspapers at the end of last year, the KMT bandit China Trust Bureau's trade deficit with Japan has reached more than US$8 million. Since the KMT bandits formally opened trade with Japan in August last year, the smuggling of Japanese goods has become even more rampant, becoming an important reason for the large increase in smuggling in the KMT-controlled areas last year.

The foreign trade in the KMT-controlled areas is completely manipulated by the four major families headed by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. The four major families actively act as comprador for the United States and Japan, profiting from the sale of national blood. For example, the Central Trust Bureau, which is nominally "state-owned" but actually the private property of Soong Mei-ling, the Soong family's Fuzhong Industrial Company, Jinshan Company, Lida Company, the Kung family's Yangtze Construction Company, and the Chen family's Taiping Xingye Company, almost completely monopolized the import and export trade in the KMT-controlled areas. They further obtained exclusive rights to import and export trade through the KMT bandit government's "Import and Export Administration Committee" restricting and so-called "managing" private import and export businesses. On the import side, because importing foreign goods can obtain two or three times the profit, the KMT bandit trade agencies desperately import American and Japanese goods. For example, Fuzhong Company exclusively operates the products of twelve American companies, Yangtze Construction Company is specifically designated as the exclusive operator of sixteen American companies, and Taiping Xingye Company also has contracts with twenty-three American companies. As for the import of Japanese goods, the KMT bandit China Trust Bureau has been continuously operating in the form of "barter" since shortly after the Japanese surrender. In the five months from January to May last year alone, the China Trust Bureau purchased 2 million yards of rayon fabrics, 340,000 yards of woolen fabrics, 2,000 bicycles, and a large number of freight cars, sewing machines, and sleepers. After the resumption of KMT-Japan trade in August last year, according to news from a magazine in Hong Kong, more than 60 companies and firms opened by bureaucratic capital in Shanghai were actively preparing to monopolize the import of Japanese goods. The reason why smuggling is so rampant is also due to the large-scale smuggling activities of the KMT bandits and the US troops stationed in China in order to obtain excessive profits. The KMT bandit China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship "Qimei" smuggled goods worth 1.5 billion KMT currency in one trip on July 15 last year. The editorial of the KMT party newspaper broadcast by the KMT Central News Agency on November 20 last year also openly admitted that KMT government officials and soldiers used their power to engage in armed smuggling, which is the main reason for the rampant smuggling. As for the illegal US troops stationed in China engaging in smuggling, it has also been constantly discovered. In August last year, a spokesman for the US Navy Fleet and Rear Admiral Pannell, commander of the US Navy in the Mariana Islands, both admitted that they had discovered a large-scale smuggling organization of US naval and air force officers flying contraband between Guam and the Chinese coast. It is well known that Kirk, commander of the US Navy's Southwest Pacific Command, was engaged in automobile smuggling.

The flooding of US and Japanese goods in the KMT-controlled areas has severely hit the national industry first. As a result, a large number of national industries went bankrupt last year. Secondly, due to the KMT bandits' monopoly and control policies, and the exclusive export trade, in addition to raising the prices of imported goods, they also implemented the "unified purchase and sales" policy for major export materials such as tung oil, bristles, tea, silk, eggs, and wool, creating unequal exchange between imported industrial products and agricultural products, and deeply hitting agricultural production in the KMT-controlled areas, thereby reducing the quantity of exports. Taking the export commodity silk as an example, last year each dan (unit of weight) cost about four dan of rice. The purchase price set by the KMT government in the spring was 1.2 million yuan per dan, which barely covered the cost, and in the autumn it was further reduced to 1.08 million yuan, which, converted to the price of rice at that time, was less than two dan of rice, resulting in silkworm farmers suffering excessive losses and being unable to continue production. Another example is that the cost of tea is about three dan of rice per dan, but the purchase price of the KMT bandit government is only two and a half dan, or even lower in some cases, so the output is decreasing day by day. Last year, the output decreased by 20% compared to the previous year. This is the cruel exploitation of Chinese farmers by the four major families and their American masters. At the same time, due to the shrinking exports and increasing trade deficit, the KMT government's foreign exchange is increasingly depleted, which in turn deepens the financial crisis of the entire KMT bandits.

In short, the KMT government's trade policy of monopoly, betrayal, and compradorism is increasingly forcing the industry and agriculture of the KMT-controlled areas to complete bankruptcy, making the entire KMT-controlled area increasingly a colony of US imperialism. Obviously, only by overthrowing the traitorous rule of the four major families headed by Chiang Kai-shek can we get rid of this colonial trade relationship, and only then can we develop China's national productive forces.

　　一九四七年蒋管区对外贸易
    黄＠
    过去一年来蒋管区的对外贸易，标志蒋区经济殖民地性质的进一步加深。
    据蒋匪海关逐月发表数字，去年蒋区进口总值共为蒋币十万零六千八百余亿元，出口总值为六万三千七百六十五亿元，全年入超为四万三千零四十六亿元。按月折合美金，进口约为四亿四千九百余万美元，出口约为二亿二千余万美元，全年入超约为百分之一百，即二亿二千余万美元，较之战前一九三五年全年入超五千九百余万美元几骤增三倍。与一九四六年比较，表面上入超数字已减少一半（按前年入超达四亿余美元），但过去一年走私入口现象已空前发展。而美货涨价，特别是蒋区购买力减退，也是原因之一。按月份分别来看，随着季节性及其他因素的变动，各个月份的入超情形是极不平衡的，从一月至十一月，一般入超比例为百分之百以上，九月份入超最大，几为百分之四百，五月份较小，为百分之二十五强，十一月份又较小，入超百分之八弱，而十二月份则为出超百分之十八强。就整个趋势看来，由于走私日益猖獗，正式进出口贸易量已日趋畸形衰落。拿去年下半年与前半年比较，出口总值已从一亿二千余万美元，减为一亿零八百余万美元，即减少百分之十一；进口总值则由前半年的二亿四千余万美元，减为后半年的二亿零七百余万美元，即减少百分之十四。
    去年蒋区走私规模之惊人庞大，曾不断引起蒋区民族工业界惊惶骇惧，就是蒋党中央日报也不得不承认已超过抗战前轰动世界的日货大走私。走私确实数字虽无从统计，但一般估计，广州及上海走私均占极大数量。走私出口据北平某杂志载，一般估计约为正式入口的六分之一。由此可知，走私贸易的入超，较正式贸易是更为恶劣的。
    再从进出口商品内容来分析，蒋区对外贸易上的殖民地性质亦表现得很清楚。去年蒋区工业原料的输出，与工业制成品的输入比重，均较往年更为增高。以蒋海关所发表的去年九月份对外贸易商品项目来看，出口货中约百分之八十为原料品，进口货中工业制成品及消费品却占了百分之七十。这较战前一九三六年原料的输出约占总额百分之五十八，工业制成品及消费品的输入约占百分之四十四的情况，显然是更为恶劣了。走私情形也是一样。如去年上半年蒋区各主要口岸海关所缉获的私货，进口以卷烟、颜料、面粉、奶粉、罐头食品、化妆品、毛织品、人造丝等为大宗，走私出口货却绝大部分为米、大豆、食盐、钨砂、锡块等原料品。
    去年蒋区进口贸易仍以美国占第一位，据美财阀华尔街日报去年八月所发表的数字，去年上半年美对华输出平均每月为二千余万美元，占全部进口一半以上。由此可知，去年一年蒋区人民在对外贸易入超、走私入超所付出的血汗钱中其最大部分是被美帝国主义所搜刮去的。此外美帝国主义者助蒋军火，主要虽以转让剩余物资及信用贷款形式给予，但仍在零星的付现的军火交易中获取巨大利润。据北平某杂志估计，在正式贸易之外，去年蒋匪资委会购买军火一项外汇即在一亿三千万美元以上。这笔外汇利润差不多全部落到美国军火大王的手里，而这也正是美帝国主义积极鼓励蒋匪进行反人民内战、残酷屠杀中国人民的目的之一。
    在过去一年中，美帝国主义且积极扩展美国占领下的日本与蒋管区的贸易关系，蒋匪帮通过“以货易货”形式，以中国盐、铁、大豆等原料供应日本，和协助日货照旧来华倾销。据去年年底蒋区报纸消息透露，蒋匪中信局在对日易货中，入超已达八百余万美元。自去年八月间蒋匪正式开放对日贸易后，日货走私更变本加厉，成为去年蒋区走私大量增加的一个重要原因。
    蒋区对外贸易完全操纵在以卖国贼蒋介石为首的四大家族手中。四大家族积极充当美、日买办，从出卖民族鲜血中谋利。如以“国营”为名实为宋美龄私产的中央信托局，宋家的孚中实业公司、金山公司、立达公司，孔家的扬子建业公司，和陈家的太平兴业公司等，几乎全部垄断了蒋区进出口贸易，他们并通过蒋匪政府的“输出入管理委员会”限制和所谓“管理”民营进出口事业的法令，而进一步取得进出口贸易独占权。在进口方面，由于输入外货可以获得二、三倍的利润，蒋匪帮贸易机关便拚命输入美货与日货。如孚中公司独家经营美国十二家公司的出品，特约扬子建业公司为独家经营者，有十六家美国公司，太平兴业公司也与二十三家美国公司订有合同。至于输入日货，蒋匪中信局也早自日本投降后不久即以“易货”方式不断经营，仅去年一月至五月五个月中，经中信局所购进者就有人造丝织品二百万码、羊毛织物三十四万码、脚踏车二千辆、以及大批货车、缝衣机、枕木等。在去年八月恢复蒋日贸易后，据香港某杂志消息，上海就有六十多家官僚资本所开设的公司行号，积极准备对日货进口的垄断。走私之所以猖獗，同样是由于蒋匪帮及驻华美军为牟取超额利润从事大规模走私的结果。蒋匪招商局轮船“其美号”于去年七月十五日一次走私即值蒋币十五亿元。蒋匪中央社去年十一月二十日广播之蒋党党报社论也公开供认：蒋政府之官僚军人利用权势武装走私，为走私猖獗之主要原因。至于非法驻华美军从事走私也曾不断被发现，去年八月美海军舰队发言人与马里亚纳美海军司令潘纳尔少将均承认，已发现有美海空军军官大规模走私组织，在关岛与中国海岸之间飞运违禁品。美海军西南太平洋司令柯克曾从事汽车走私，亦为众所周知。
    美日货泛滥蒋区，首先受到严重打击的是民族工业。去年民族工业因此大批倒闭。其次由于蒋匪垄断统制政策，独占出口贸易除抬高进口货价格外，又实行了对桐油、猪鬃、茶、丝、蛋、羊毛等主要出口物资的“统购统销”政策，造成了进口工业品与农产品的不等价交换，又深深打击了蒋区的农业生产，因而减少出口数量。以出口品蚕丝来说，去年每担成本需四担米左右，蒋政府规定的收购价格春季每担一百二十万元勉强刚够成本，秋季则更减为一百零八万元，依当时米价折合尚不到二担米，以致蚕农亏损过甚不能再生产。再如茶叶成本每担为三担米左右，蒋匪政府收购价格却只有二担半甚至有时更低，因此产量日减，去年产量较前年又减少百分之二十。这就是四大家族及其美国主子对于中国农民的残酷剥夺。同时由于出口日趋萎缩，入超日增的结果，已使蒋政府外汇日益枯竭，反过来加深了整个蒋匪金融财政的危机。
    总之，蒋政府垄断、卖国、买办的贸易政策，已日益迫使蒋区工农业走向完全破产，使全蒋管区日益沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。显然，只有推翻以蒋介石为首的四大家族的卖国统治，才能摆脱这种殖民地化的贸易关系，也才能发展中国民族生产力。
