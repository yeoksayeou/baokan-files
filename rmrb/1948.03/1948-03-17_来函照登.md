　　To the "Letter to the Editor" Editor:
    I am sending you the draft "Taihang, Taiyue, and Southern Hebei Determine Afforestation Plan." There are a few incorrect numbers, please correct them. In the Taihang this year's afforestation plan: 1. "Zuoquan will also continue to plant another 100,000 trees as last year," should be "10,000 trees"; 2. "The focus is on both sides of the Handan-Changzhi Highway, and 30,000 trees will be replanted on both sides of the highway," should be "15,000 trees will be planted and survive." 3. "Shè County alone plans to plant 100,000 trees," should be "Only along the Zhang River in Shè County, there are plans to plant 80,000 trees." 4. "The Xingtai Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry is responsible," should be "The Xingtai Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, in collaboration with the Shahe Construction Section and Farm, is responsible."
    Please take the trouble to correct the above. With best regards,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cooperation Department of the Border Government, Jing Ting

　　来函照登编辑同志：
    寄去“太行、太岳、冀南确定造林计划”一稿，写错几个数字，请予更正。太行今年植树计划中：一、左权亦继续去年再植十万株，”应为“一万株”；二、“邯长公路两侧为重点，公路两旁，补植三万株”，应为“植活一万五千株”。三、“仅涉县即计划植十万株”，应为“仅涉县清漳沿岸，即计划植八万株”。四、“由邢台农林局负责”，应为“由邢台农林局协同沙河建设科、农场负责”。
    以上请费心更正。致敬礼
