Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 19th: Frontline reporter Feng Mu reports: The day after the liberation of Luoyang, General Chen Geng met with Qiu Xingxiang, commander of the Kuomintang army's Youth Army 206th Division, and Fu Shaoji, deputy chief of staff, who had laid down their arms in the city. During the meeting, Qiu had a bandage wrapped around his head by the People's Liberation Army, bowed his head respectfully, and looked dejected. After General Chen Geng elaborated on the People's Liberation Army's policy towards captured officers and soldiers, he said to them: "You fought very hard this time, with heavy casualties. We originally did not want to use a large amount of artillery, but because you stubbornly refused to lay down your weapons, and in order to resolve the battle as soon as possible and allow the people of Luoyang to live a safe life, we had to put such fierce artillery fire on you. Relying on the solidity of Luoyang's fortifications, you thought you could resist our army, but now you can probably see that no matter how well your fortifications are built, they cannot withstand the power of the People's Liberation Army." General Chen Geng went on to point out that using deception and secret service rule to get young intellectuals to become soldiers and serve as "SS troops" for the dying bandit gang was a crime. General Chen said: "You are too cruel. You used shameless means to deceive pure and innocent young students into becoming cannon fodder, and used secret service rule and anesthetic deceptive education to turn them into fascist 'SS troops', forcing them to die for you in the trenches. This is a monstrous crime of harming Chinese youth. I express my deep regret for the many innocent young students who were victimized by you in this campaign. But even so, the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique is already doomed and irreversible!" During the conversation, Chiang Kai-shek's plane was circling over the city, and the sound of machine gun fire made Qiu uneasy. General Chen smiled and said: "You see, the American-Chiang Kai-shek plane is just here to mourn!" Qiu Xingxiang looked embarrassed and suddenly muttered in a low voice: "I am from Jiangsu, General Chen Yi once lived in my house, I came from a poor background, please ask General Chen Yi and he will know." General Chen Geng said humorously: "Your class background is very good, but unfortunately you are serving the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, becoming their loyal accomplices." Qiu then said that Fu was an overseas Chinese. Fu said: "I lived in San Francisco, Australia, Singapore and other places for a long time. I haven't wanted to fight for a long time and want to go home. I hope that General Chen will allow me to return to San Francisco this time." General Chen Geng readily replied: "We know that overseas Chinese are under the direct oppression of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and have national consciousness, so I believe that you said you wanted to go home long ago, and I will definitely help you realize this wish. But you must know that without overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government, the international status of overseas Chinese will always be bad. One of the current goals of our war is to liberate overseas Chinese." Fu also said that his family was still in the city. General Chen Geng immediately sent someone to look for them with him. After finding them, he gave his family several million Chiang Kai-shek currency and a stone of grain to settle down. Fu said with emotion: "You are too good to me, too good!" When they parted, his wife said to him: "I feel much more at ease sending you to them (referring to the People's Liberation Army) than in the Kuomintang army."

　　陈赓将军接见邱行湘　痛斥蒋匪戕害青年
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十九日电】前线记者冯牧报道：洛阳解放后的次日，陈赓将军于城内接见放下武器的蒋军青年军二○六师师长邱行湘和副参谋长符绍基。会见时邱头里解放军替他包缠的纱布，低首恭立，神情沮丧。陈赓将军阐述解放军对俘虏官兵的政策后便对他们说：“这次你们打得很苦，死伤很重，我们本来不想使用大量炮兵，但因你们固执不放下武器，由于想早些解决战斗，使洛阳人民获得安全生活，我们不得不把这样猛烈的炮火加在你们身上。你们凭着洛阳工事的坚固，以为足能抵挡我军，现在你们大概可以看出你们的工事做的再好，也无法抵挡解放军的威力。”陈赓将军继并指出他们用欺骗和特务统治手段，让青年知识分子来当兵，替垂死的匪帮做“党卫军”是一种罪恶。陈将军说：“你们太残酷了，把纯洁无辜的青年学生，用无耻的手段骗来当炮灰，用特务统治和麻醉欺骗教育，把他们变成法西斯的“党卫军”，强迫他们到战壕里替你们送死，这是一种戕害中国青年的滔天罪行，我对在此次战役被你们陷害的许多无辜青年学生，表示万分惋惜。但就是这样蒋介石统治集团的垮台是已经注定了，不可挽回的了！”谈话时蒋机正在市区盘旋，机枪扫射的声音使邱惶惑不安，陈将军笑说：“你们看美蒋飞机不过来吊孝而已！”邱行湘面现局促，突讷讷低语：“我是江苏人，陈毅将军曾住在我家，我是贫苦出身，请问陈毅将军就知道”。陈赓将军幽默的说：“你的成份倒很好，可惜你是为大地主大资产阶级服务，成为他们忠实的帮凶”。邱继谓符为华侨，符说：“我曾长时住在旧金山、澳洲、新加坡等地，我好久不愿打仗，想回家去，希望这次陈将军能允许我回旧金山”。陈赓将军欣然回答：“我们深知华侨处在帝国主义与蒋匪的直接压迫下是有民族意识的，所以你说老早想回家我很相信，一定帮助你实现此愿望。但是你要知道不推翻蒋匪的卖国政府，华侨的国际地位永远是恶劣的，当前我们的战争目的之一，也就是为了解放华侨”。符又说他的家属还在城里，陈赓将军立即派人和他一起去找寻，找到后又送给他家里数百万元蒋币和一石粮食安家，符感动的说：“你们对我太好了，太好了！”他们分别时，他妻子对他说：“把你送到他们（指解放军）那里比在国民党军队里，我放心得多。”
