This Newspaper Announces News Prize to Solicit Typical Reports on Land Reform Work

　　Last year, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau gave this newspaper a prize of 280,000 yuan to initiate a news communication award. It was supported by a large number of readers and correspondents. However, it was not continued due to the lax selection criteria.

　　The Party rectification, democracy, and filling-in movements in our region have begun one after another. It is extremely important to quickly summarize concrete experiences and disseminate them. In response to Chairman Mao's call on March 12 and the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, this newspaper is re-launching a campaign to solicit typical news reports. We hope that the responsible comrades of the work teams and all the correspondents who are participating in the Party rectification, democracy, and filling-in movements will "pay attention to collecting and disseminating typical experiences that have been selected" in their work, and "summarize concrete experiences, quickly disseminate these experiences to the masses, so that correct ones can be promoted and errors can be avoided."

　　When organizing such reports, we should promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts and investigation and research. Based on the characteristics of the work, we should provide specific experiences (regardless of success or failure) in a specific environment, and base it on the ideological requirements of the masses, reflecting the tortuous process of combining the leadership's policies with the masses' demands. When writing, we hope you pay attention to the specific and avoid empty and abstract "improvement". Explain and solve problems from the reflection of the masses' ideological and conscious process, so that our news reports can truly play a typical demonstration role, so that comrades who lack these experiences can get the method to start.

　　We welcome comrades from work teams in various places to write articles for this newspaper in a planned way. Once disclosed, if the experience is proven to be valuable in the movement and is praised by the leadership organs and the broad masses, the newspaper will organize awards after a certain period of time. Special prize: 20,000 yuan; first prize: 10,000 yuan; second prize: 5,000 yuan; third prize: 3,000 yuan. The first phase is from this month to July 15.

　　本报为颁发新闻奖金
  　征集土改工作典型报导通知
    去年中央局宣传部×予本报二十八万元奖金，发起新闻通讯征奖，曾得到广大读者与通讯员同志响应。但因评选标准不严，没有继续下去。
    我区整党民主与填补运动，已经先后开始，迅速总结具体经验，传播推广，极为重要。本报为响应毛主席三月十二日号召，接中央局宣传部指示，特重新发起典型新闻报导征稿运动，希望各地参加整党、民主填补运动的工作团负责同志和全体通讯员同志，在工作中“注意搜集和传播经过选择的典型性的经验”，“总结具体的经验，向群众迅速传播这些经验，使正确的获得推广，错误的不致重犯。”
    在组织这种报导时，应发扬实事求是，调查研究精神。根据工作中的特点，提供具体环境下的具体经验（不论成功与失败的），并以群众的思想要求为基础，反映出领导方针与群众要求结合的曲折过程。写作时希注意具体，避免空洞抽象的“提高”，从群众的思想自觉过程的反映中说明和解决问题，使我们的新闻报导能真正发挥典型示范作用，使缺乏这些经验的同志能够得到下手的方法。
    我们欢迎各地工作团同志，有计划的为本报写稿，一经披露，在运动中经事实证明确系宝贵经验，为领导机关及广大群众所赞扬者，在一定时期后，即由本报组织评奖，特等二万元，甲等一万元，乙等五千元，丙等三千元，第一期自本月起至七月十五日止。
