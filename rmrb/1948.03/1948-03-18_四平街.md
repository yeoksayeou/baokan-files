Siping Street

　　Siping is the capital of Liaobei Province and an important strategic stronghold in Northeast China. It is located in the center of the South Manchurian Plain and is the connecting point of the Changchun Railway and the Siping-Meihekou and Siping-Tao'an Railways, connecting East, West, North, and South Manchuria. It has historically been a place of military importance for both offense and defense. After our army launched the summer offensive last year, Chiang Kai-shek personally instructed Chen Mingren, commander of his 71st Army, saying, "Siping is a strategic fortress in the Northeast. If it is not defended, the Northeast will be in danger!" This shows the enemy's emphasis on this location. After Chiang's bandits occupied Siping on May 19, 1946, they forced all the city's residents to spend more than a year building modern, permanent fortifications throughout the city, with pillboxes everywhere connected by trenches and covered passages. Many independent buildings in the city were also reinforced with strong fortifications, forming interconnected firing networks. Each pillbox and machine gun was numbered according to its position, directly connected to the group of fortifications. In June of last year, our army launched a heroic and tenacious large-scale siege of the city, and after sixteen days and nights of fierce fighting, annihilated more than 16,000 enemies before actively withdrawing from the city. This time, our army's capture of Siping was less than a year after the previous battle. The battle was resolved in just twenty-three hours, and once again, all 16,000-plus defending enemies were wiped out.

　　Siping is an emerging city and a distribution center for goods from Northwest Manchuria. During the Japanese occupation, there were plans to build Siping into an important industrial city because of the abundant coal reserves in the vicinity, as well as the production of natural soda ash and limestone. The Yitong Mountains nearby have inexhaustible underground water sources for industrial use. The city has new-style flour mills, alcohol factories, rice mills, paper mills, and oil and chemical plants, etc.

　　四平街
    四平是辽北省的省会，为东北重要的战略据点，位于南满平原中心，是中长铁路与四梅（河口）四洮（安）铁路的连接点，贯通东西南北满，历来为攻守用兵之地。去年我军夏季攻势开始后，蒋介石曾手谕其七十一军军长陈明仁称：“四平为东北战略要塞，如不保则东北危矣！”可见敌对该地之重视。一九四六年五月十九日蒋匪侵占四平后，即驱使全市民力，以年余时间，在城内遍筑现代化之永久性防御工事，地堡群立，以交通沟、盖沟互相联串。市内很多独立建筑物亦均增筑强固工事，组织互相联系之火力网，其间每一地堡，每一机枪均按位置编号，直达集团工事。去年六月间我军曾向该城展开英勇顽强的巨大攻坚战，经十六昼夜激战，歼敌一万六千余名后主动撤离该城。此次我军攻占四平，距前役为时尚不及一年，解决战斗仅二十三小时，又再次全歼守敌一万六千余。
    四平是新兴城市，为北西满货物之集散中心，日寇统治时曾计划将四平建成一重要工业城市，因其附近煤藏量极丰，且产天然曹达、石炭石等，其附近伊通山岭有无穷之地下水源可供工业利用。市内有新型制粉厂、酒精厂、制米厂、造纸厂、油化工厂等。
