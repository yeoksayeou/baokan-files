    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 17th: Moscow dispatch: Major industrial centers in the Soviet Union have successively completed and exceeded their February production plans ahead of schedule. The output of automobiles, tractors, combine harvesters, machine tools, turbines, and consumer goods is surging. In Moscow, 250 factories completed February production eight days ahead of schedule, and produced extra goods worth tens of millions of rubles beyond the plan. Ten large factories in Leningrad and mechanical factories in cities such as Kyiv, Tashkent, and Voroshilov also completed their February plans ahead of schedule; the Dzerzhinsky factory in Dnipropetrovsk produced 16.5 percent more steel and 7 percent more milled iron than in January. Employees of power stations in Moscow, Sverdlovsk, and the Donets Basin recently wrote to Stalin guaranteeing to "exert all efforts to help the most important industrial centers complete the Stalin post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 18th: Moscow dispatch: Yakov Troyan, a stope worker at the Kryvyi Rih iron ore center, has created a new record in recent years.
