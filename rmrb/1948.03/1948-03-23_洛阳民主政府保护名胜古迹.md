       Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E, 21st: During the time when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied Luoyang, many historical sites and scenic spots in the ancient capital were destroyed. Longmen (also known as Yique), 20 miles south of the city, contains tens of thousands of stone Buddhas from the Northern Wei and Tang dynasties, comparable to the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, but now most of them are damaged. The White Horse Temple, 30 miles east of the city, was built when Buddhism was first introduced to China and is a sacred place as the "Source of释" in China. It was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who used the Grand Hall as a kitchen, blackening all the ancient Buddhas of thousands of years. Shangqing Palace, north of the city, rumored to be where Lao Tzu practiced, was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits as an outer stronghold for city defense, and now only remnants of barbed wire remain. Other sites such as Jiulong Terrace and Zhougong Temple were all used as strongholds by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The surrounding trees and houses were mostly cut down and demolished, and the terrain was also changed by their construction of fortifications, leaving no trace of the historical sites. The democratic government has now issued a proclamation to the military and civilians to earnestly protect historical sites and scenic spots.
       Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st: The CPC Beiyue District Committee and Administrative Office have decided to establish a Wutai Mountain Management Committee to manage cultural relics and historical sites. It will be composed of the Secretary of the Wutai County Party Committee, the County Magistrate, and monks from the temples, with the Secretary of the County Party Committee as the director of the committee, directly under the leadership of the Beiyue District Administrative Office. In addition, in order to manage Xiling in Yi County, Qilin Temple in Lingshou, Dawang Temple in Quyang, Miaofeng Mountain in Western Hebei, Tanzhe Temple, and other important historical sites and scenic spots in other regions, each county will also prepare to form a management committee.

       洛阳民主政府保护名胜古迹
    【新华社豫陕鄂二十一日电】洛阳古都名胜古迹，在蒋匪盘踞时多被毁坏。城南二十里的龙门（一称伊阙），有北魏、唐代石佛以万计，与大同云岗石窟齐名，现已大部缺损。城东三十里白马寺，为佛教最初传入我国时所建，为中国“释源”圣地，竟被蒋匪占用，并将大雄殿当厨房，千年古佛全被熏黑。城北上清宫，传为老子修炼处，被蒋匪占作城防外围据点，现已仅存铁丝网的残迹。其他如九龙台、周公庙，都被蒋匪充作据点，周围树木房屋，多遭其砍伐拆毁，地形也被其修工事改变，名胜古迹荡然无存。现民主政府已布告军民切实保护古迹名胜。
    【新华社晋察冀二十一日电】中共北岳区党委与行署为保管文物古迹，决定设立五台山管理委员会。由五台县委书记、县长及寺院和尚等人组成，由县委书记为委员会主任，直接受北岳区行署领导。此外，为保管易县之西灵、灵寿之麒麟院、曲阳之大王殿、平西之妙峰山、潭柘寺以及其他地区之重要名胜古迹，亦将由各县筹组保管委员会。
