Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd. Our correspondent recently commented on the fact that Chiang Kai-shek executed Qiao Wenli, commander of the 79th Division, a defeated general in southern Shenyang, on the 27th:

Just the day after bandit Wei Lihuang suffered repeated defeats, and Wang Jiashen, commander of the 58th Provisional Division of the Chiang army in Yingkou, led his troops in a glorious uprising; and exactly one week after Marshall scolded Chiang Kai-shek, his dissatisfied lackey, for his defeats and accused Chiang of "lacking leadership ability," Chiang Kai-shek, in order to vent his anger, executed Qiao Wenli, commander of the 79th Division of the 49th Army of the old Northeast Army, a scapegoat for the defeat in southern Shenyang.

Chiang Kai-shek and bandit Wei Lihuang pushed all the responsibility for the defeat in southern Shenyang onto Qiao Wenli. But Qiao Wenli did indeed work for the Chiang gang. Two months ago, in the Battle of Zhangwu, he fought until his ammunition and food ran out, wiping out an entire division. After being captured, he escaped in disguise and went to the rotten team of the 55th Provisional Division in Shenyang to protect bandit Wei Lihuang, but now he has received such a tragic reward.

The cruelty and violence of the Chiang-Wei bandit chiefs and the benevolence and righteousness of the People's Liberation Army are in stark contrast, highlighting how grim and desolate this dying reactionary ruling clique is. Last time in the Battle of Zhangwu, when our army captured Qiao's wife and son, they were treated with leniency and immediately released. But after they returned to Shenyang and reunited for less than two months, they watched their husband and father die under the butcher knife of the Chiang-Wei bandit gang. The reporter concluded: Qiao Wenli and Wang Jiashen are two different examples. The result of working for Chiang Kai-shek is disgrace and death, and being left to rot in a foreign land; while those who revolt gloriously are warmly welcomed by the people—these are two paths to life and death, honor and disgrace. Chiang's army officers should choose wisely.

　　替蒋卖命落得这样悲惨下场
  　卫匪枪决师长乔文礼
    推脱在沈南连吃败仗的责任
    【新华社东北二日电】本社记者顷就蒋贼于二十七日枪决沈南败战将领七十九师师长乔文礼一事评称：
    正当卫匪立煌连吃败仗，营口蒋军暂五十八师师长王家善率部光荣起义的第二天，也正是距马歇尔不满奴才蒋介石打败仗训斥蒋贼“缺乏领袖才能”之后一个星期，为了泄愤，把沈南败战的旧东北军四十九军七十九师师长乔文礼当作替罪羊枪决了。
    蒋贼与卫匪立煌把沈南败战的责任一股脑儿推到乔文礼身上。但乔文礼确实是为蒋匪帮卖过命的，两个月前彰武之役，他打到弹尽粮绝，把一个整师打得精光，本人被俘后化装逃脱，又去沈阳暂五十五师那个烂队伍里替卫匪立煌保驾，然而现在却落得如此悲惨的一个酬报。
    蒋卫匪首的残酷凶暴和人民解放军的仁至义尽真是一个强烈的对照，而显得这个垂死的反动统治集团何等阴森凄厉。前次彰武之役，当我军俘获乔的妻子和儿子时曾予宽大待遇，随即加以释放，但他们回到沈阳以后团聚不到两个月，就眼睁睁地看着自己的丈夫和父亲死在蒋卫匪帮的屠刀下。记者结论称：乔文礼和王家善这是两个不同的典型，为蒋贼卖命的结果是身败名裂，暴尸异乡；而光荣起义的则受到人民的热烈欢迎——这是生死荣辱的两个前途，何去何从，蒋军军官们当善自选择。
