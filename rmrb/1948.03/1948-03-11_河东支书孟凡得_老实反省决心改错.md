　　River East Branch Secretary Meng Fande

　　Honestly Reflects and Resolves to Correct Mistakes

　　Meng Fande, the political director of Hedong Village in Wu'an, is a party member of less than a year, and the masses reflect that he generally cares about the masses, is enthusiastic about doing things, and is considered a better cadre. After the party rectification began, he not only honestly reflected on himself, but also helped other party members to reflect. The following is his reflection:

　　The spring before last, when distributing fruit, my position was not firm. During the assessment, the real poor and hired peasants were not high, the highest was ten points, and the lowest was only one point. I was assessed fifteen points. I arranged the land sale, and I took a piece of land first. After selling the land, I sold the property again. My thinking took a turn. I wanted a wardrobe, using the excuse that the farmers' association needed it for lending (but it wasn't actually needed). I left it behind first, and then I bought it. My fifteen points (300 yuan per point) totaled 4,500, and I bought the land without going through the masses. I am sorry to the masses for this matter, and I will honestly return the land. At that time, some masses only had one mu of land per person, but they left good land near the land to the landlords. That winter, when filling in and making up the difference, loose wood rafters were struggled out. I thought to myself: My north house hasn't been built yet, so I said to the masses: It's useless to divide the loose wood rafters into two pieces, it's better to sell them. In fact, I had made up my mind. I called the cadres and activists to evaluate the money (because they were reliable), it was very cheap, and I wanted it. I saw a livestock halter, I wanted it, but I was afraid the masses would know, so I put it in the cooperative first, and then took it home. I also took a fancy to the chopping board and took it home. After the fruit was distributed, three hoes were left behind. I thought if I took them, the landlord would definitely ask me to buy them next year, and I could sell them for money; but the landlord never asked me to buy them. I must take out all these things.

　　When the district held a meeting, they didn't want cadres to be rated high, but they could be rewarded at the end. A total of thirty-two cadres and activists in our village were rated, and I thought that activists were capable, but the masses were not capable. My share was a mattress and a quilt. I didn't want it. Everyone said, why don't you want it? I thought: I already have them, and I still think it's too much! Later, they allocated grain again. Later, someone said that Zhao Zhuang started to report that the cadres in our street were distributing things! So I gave him a blow: "Tell him to come to our street to report!" When "washing faces and wiping black," Yang Tang (a district cadre) asked to return the over-occupied fruit. I ideologically resisted the superiors. The next day, I took out four items, a mirror, gloves, etc., but I was dissatisfied in my heart. I said: "What role do these four things play in filling in and making up the difference? I still paid for the rafters!" As I spoke, I cried, actually wanting Yang Tang to make a turn and let me buy them. Later, I bought them, and I was satisfied. The poor and hired peasants failed to thoroughly turn themselves over several times, but the cadres and activists thoroughly turned themselves over.

　　Whatever the superiors call for, we will do. We established village finances and sold 142 silver dollars that were struggled for, and some fruit was also sold. At that time, I only thought that the fruit was from the landlords who were struggled against, and I didn't realize that it belonged to the masses.

　　After the Land Law Outline was issued, I thought it would be easy to thoroughly divide the land. Last year, the gardens were divided, and that was almost it. I didn't feel anything. When the masses raised opinions, I still thought it was "washing faces and wiping black," and it would be over after a meeting. I wasn't called on the first day, and I wasn't called on the second day when they were divided into two groups. I wondered what was going on, why didn't they call me to participate in the meeting? My thinking fluctuated, and I couldn't even eat breakfast. When the mass representatives raised opinions, my thinking calmed down. The opinions raised by the masses are all correct, and I am determined to throw away my muddled thinking. (Recorded by Yu Village)

### 河东支书孟凡得　老实反省决心改错

　　河东支书孟凡得
  　老实反省决心改错
    武安河东村政治主任孟凡得，还是不满一年的党员，群众反映他一般还关心群众，热心办事，算个较好的干部。整党开始后，他不只自己老实反省，而且还帮助别的党员反省。下面是他的反省：
    前年春天分果实，我立场站不稳，评议时真正贫雇群众不高，最高的十分，少的只一分，评议了我十五分。卖地时是我布置的，我先占了一块地。卖罢地后又卖家伙，我思想上转了个弯，想要个卧柜，借口农会要放帐用（实际上不用）先留下，后来我就买下了。我的十五分（每分三百元）合四千五，未经过群众就买了地，这件事对不起群众，我要把地老老实实的退出来。当时群众还有一口人合一亩地的，却给地主留了好地近地。当年冬天填平补齐，斗争出来了松木椽，我想了想：我北屋还没盖哩，就给群众说：松木椽分成两根也没用，不如卖了，实际是我打了主意。叫干部、积极分子评价钱（因为他们顶事），很便宜，我就要了。见了个牲口稍子，我想要，怕群众知道，就先放在合作社，后来拿到家去了。又看上案板，也拿到家了。分罢了果实，丢下了三把镢头，我想我要是拿走了，想明年地主一定找我买，我就可以卖个钱；后来地主也没找我买。以上这些东西我一定要拿出来。
    区上开会时，不叫给干部评高，末后可奖励一下。我村干部和积极分子共评了卅二人，我认为积极分子能干，群众不能干。我那一份是一个铺的一个盖的，我不要，大家说为啥不要哩？我想：有，我还嫌多哩！后来又弄开粮食了。后来有人说赵庄起反映，说咱街干部分东西哩！我就给了他个打击：“叫他来咱街反映吧！”洗脸擦黑时，杨汤（区干部）叫退多占果实，我思想抵抗上级，第二天我拿出了镜子、手套等四样，但心里不满，我说：“这四样东西对填平补齐起了啥作用？椽子我还是出的钱哩！”说着就哭了，其实想叫杨汤转个弯，叫我买下，后来还是我买了，我就满意了。贫雇群众几次斗争没有翻透身，干部、积极分子却翻透了。
    上级号召啥，咱就干啥，建立村财政卖了斗争的一百四十二块现洋，果实也卖了些。那时我只是认为果实是斗的地主的，没认识到是群众的。
    土地法大纲下来以后，我想彻底分地好弄，去年已把园分了分，也就差不多了。感觉没有啥。群众提意见，我还以为是“洗脸擦黑”，开个会就完了，第一天没叫我，第二天分两组也没叫我，思想这是怎着哩，为啥不叫咱参加会哩？思想有波动，早饭也没吃下去，到群众代表提意见，我思想才安静下来。群众提的都对，我决心把糊涂思想扔掉。（于村纪录）
