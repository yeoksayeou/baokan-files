Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Moscow dispatch: Ms. Anna Peeler Bugel, assistant to the head of the press department of the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, recently submitted her resignation to the US Ambassador Smith, saying that she "decided to resign and stay in the Soviet Union and happily begin a new life." In her letter of resignation, she pointed out: "The reason that prompted her to resign was due to her deep love for the Soviet people and also the discovery of personal happiness in the Soviet Union." She said: "During her stay in the Soviet Union, due to her personal experience, she had a practical understanding of this country and saw that the excellent Soviet people were doing their best to make the world a more beautiful paradise, thus making her feel that her current views and staying in the embassy to do work hostile to the Soviet people are completely incompatible."

　　美驻苏使馆一职员热爱苏联
  　辞职留居苏联
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科讯：美驻苏大使馆新闻司助理司长安娜培勒·布茄尔女士，近向美大使史密斯提出辞职书，说她“决定辞职留居苏联，欢快地开始新生活”。她在辞职书中指出：“促使她辞职的原因，是由于她对苏联人民产生了挚爱，也发现了在苏联的个人幸福”。她说：“她在苏联居住的时期中，由于亲身体验，对这个国家有了实际的了解，看出苏联的优秀人民正尽他们最大的努力，使世界成为一个生活更美满的乐园，因而使她感到目前自己的观点和留在大使馆作敌对苏联人民的工作，是完全不相容的”。
