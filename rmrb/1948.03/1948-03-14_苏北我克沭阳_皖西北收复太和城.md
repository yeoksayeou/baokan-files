Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th: In Northern Jiangsu, our army has recovered Shuyang city and its surrounding more than ten strongholds, including Dongxin'an Town, Yinping, Gaoliu, and Longgou. The defending enemy, an entire regiment of the 162nd Brigade of the Kuomintang's reorganized 44th Division and local bandits, fled entirely to Xinpu, Haizhou, and Suqian on the 4th and 5th. Our army also took the opportunity to attack the Chenshi'an area, twenty miles northwest of Lianshui city, wiping out over a hundred local bandits, and seizing four light machine guns and one 60mm mortar. Now, within a vast area of two hundred miles east and west of Shuyang city, and one hundred and fifty miles south of the (Nantong)-(Ganzhou) Yumu line to Lianshui and north to Dayi Mountain, there is no trace of the enemy.
