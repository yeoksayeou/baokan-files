Five Policies for Uniting with Middle Peasants
　　Answer to Comrade Zhang Shutong

Editor:

The "2.1" instruction of the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region stated in the last part of the third section: "We must resolutely unite with the middle peasants and not harm their interests. The five specific policies for uniting with the middle peasants must be carefully studied and implemented without any discount." We have been unable to find materials regarding these five specific policies. Please provide a reply. (Zhang Shutong)

Comrade Zhang Shutong: The five specific policies for uniting with the middle peasants were instructed in Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks." Listed item by item, they are: (1) When distributing land in various places, attention must be paid to the opinions of the middle peasants. If the middle peasants do not agree, concessions should be made to them. (2) When confiscating and distributing the land and property of the feudal class, attention should be paid to the needs of some middle peasants. (3) When classifying class components, care must be taken not to mistakenly classify those who are originally middle peasants into the ranks of rich peasants. (4) In the peasant association committees and in the government, active middle peasant elements must be absorbed to participate in the work. (5) Adopt fair and reasonable principles in land tax and the burden of supporting the war. The above five policies should be strictly observed in the work. At the same time, propaganda and explanation should also be carried out to dispel the doubts of some middle peasants about the implementation of the land law and to reassure them to produce.

　　团结中农的五项政策
  　答张树桐同志编辑同志：
    晋冀鲁豫中央局“二、一”指示第三段最后提出：“必须坚决团结中农，不要损害中农利益。以及团结中农的五项具体政策必须仔细研究，不折不扣的付诸实行”，关于团结中农的五项具体政策，我们始终没有找出这五项具体政策的材料，请给予答复。（张树桐）
    张树桐同志：团结中农的五项具体政策，是毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”报告里所指示的。分项列举就是：（一）各地在平分土地时，须注意中农的意见，如果中农不同意，则应向中农让步。（二）在没收分配封建阶级的土地财产时，应当注意某些中农的需要。（三）在划阶级成份时，必须注意不要把本来是中农成份的人，错误地将他们划到富农圈子里去。（四）在农会委员会中，在政府中，必须吸收中农积极分子参加工作。（五）在土地税及支援战争的负担上，采取公平合理的原则。以上五项政策，在工作中应该严格遵守，同时，也要进行宣传解释，以解除某些中农对实行土地法的疑虑，而安心生产。　　　　——编者
