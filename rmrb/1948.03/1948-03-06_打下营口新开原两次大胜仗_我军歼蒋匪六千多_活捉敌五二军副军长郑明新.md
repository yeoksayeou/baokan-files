Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just released Operational Communiqué No. 26, announcing the details of the battles of Yingkou and Xin Kaiyuan and preliminary statistics of the results as follows:

　　A unit of our field army, after capturing "Steel Capital" Anshan, marched south victoriously, directly attacking Yingkou, one of the two major ports of the Northeast Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits stubbornly resisted reinforcements. At 4:00 PM on the 25th of last month, they used planes to carry American military advisors to inspect the area for one hour, arranging landing points and planning to airlift reinforcements the next day. However, our army immediately launched a general attack at 8:00 PM that evening. The 58th Provisional Division of the Chiang Kai-shek Army's 52nd Army stationed in the city also gloriously revolted at the same time, arresting Zheng Mingxin, deputy commander of the army, Li An, chief of the traffic police, and Yuan Hongda and other 38 ringleaders of the puppet Yingkou municipal party and government, disarming more than 1,000 police, gendarmes, and security teams, and resolutely turning their guns around to the people. Our troops attacking the city engaged in fierce battles with the stubbornly resisting enemy for nine hours, annihilating more than 2,000 enemies from the city defense headquarters and traffic police, and completely liberating the key sea and land transportation port of Yingkou at 5:00 AM on the 26th. The next day, another unit of our army launched an attack on Xin Kaiyuan, an important town on the central Changchun Railway north of Shenyang. The attack started at 4:00 PM on the 27th. After three hours of battle, all defending enemies including the 1st Regiment of the 30th Provisional Division of the 53rd Army and remnants of the 62nd Provisional Division fleeing from Faku, totaling more than 3,400 men, were wiped out, and Xin Kaiyuan, the enemy's fortified stronghold at Qinghe Bridge, was recovered. Preliminary statistics of the results of the two battles are as follows: A total of 6,493 enemies were annihilated, including the living capture of Zheng Mingxin, deputy commander of the enemy's 52nd Army, Lv Weiji, commander of the 1st Regiment of the 30th Provisional Division of the 53rd Army, Li An, chief of the traffic police, deputy chief, chief of staff and others, totaling 5,888, and 605 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded (the Yingkou battle annihilated 3,093 enemies, and the Kaiyuan battle annihilated 3,400 enemies). Seized: 2 anti-tank guns, 3 anti-aircraft guns, 12 light and heavy mortars, 30 60mm mortars, 15 grenade launchers, 11 rocket launchers, 28 heavy machine guns, 153 light machine guns, 809 submachine guns, 2 anti-tank rifles, 93 automatic rifles, 2,046 rifles and pistols, 3,651,289 rounds of ammunition of various types, 4,977 shells of various types, plus 460 boxes, 16,358 grenades, 11 vehicles, and many other materials.
