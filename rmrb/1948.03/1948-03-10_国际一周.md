　　International Week
    ——March 2nd to 8th——
    Several noteworthy events occurred in the East this week.
    First, the U.S. imperialists' support for Japanese militarism is becoming increasingly blatant. Recently, MacArthur took another important step in industrially reviving Japanese militarism by secretly incorporating 125 munitions factories, originally listed in the reparations plan, into production enterprises, ordering them to accelerate production. At the same time, MacArthur vigorously supported the reactionary new Ashida government that succeeded the Katayama cabinet, proving that "the new cabinet will more vigorously pursue policies that suit the monopoly interests of the United States than the Katayama cabinet" (Japanese Communist Party statement). Especially shameless is the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who, acting as an echo of his master, recites the so-called "Japanese peace treaty is not as important as Japan's economic recovery"; while praising the Ashida cabinet's program, saying it is "more progressive than the Katayama cabinet," completely exposing his past attempts to conceal his treacherous face. Simultaneously with Ashida's inauguration, labor unrest is rising in Japan. Following the 24-hour strike at the end of last month by 500,000 railway workers demanding wage increases, railway workers in Sendai, Kansai, and other regions have successively joined the strike, and the labor unrest is likely to spread throughout the country. The Soviet newspaper "Labor" commented on the Japanese working people's resistance to the reactionaries' offensive, saying: "This greatly shakes the foundation of the Ashida cabinet, preventing it from being peaceful or long-lived."
    Second, in South Korea under U.S. military rule, the broad masses of the people have seen through the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to enslave the South Korean people and are constantly carrying out heroic resistance. The week before, the South Korean people held grand parades and demonstrations demanding that the U.S. military get out of Korea. Demonstrators attacked seven police stations. Currently, the South Korean people, like the North Korean people, are continuing to launch a movement against U.S. imperialist division and demanding a democratic and unified Korea.
    Third, due to the collusion between the Hatta cabinet and the Indonesian national scum in West Java, the eyes of the Indonesian people have become brighter, and they have risen to continue their resolute struggle against the imperialists and the Hatta puppet government. The recent increase in Dutch aggressors' troops in Indonesia is proof of this. The leading organs of Indonesian left-wing labor organizations held a meeting the week before, and the resolution clearly pointed out: to fight for the establishment of a new Indonesian People's Republic government, the Central Committee of the Indonesian Trade Union Federation has announced the adoption of concerted action. This is enough to show that although a small number of upper-class Indonesians have compromised and surrendered to U.S. and Dutch imperialism, the Indonesian people will never compromise and surrender, and they will fight to the end for independence, democracy, and freedom.
    Fourth, the Vietnamese people are heroically upholding the just patriotic war. Since the French imperialists perfidiously attacked Vietnam in September and October last year, they have been constantly battered by Viet Minh guerrillas. On the first of this month, 2,500 strong guerrillas attacked a French transport convoy, destroying 62 vehicles and killing 60 escorting soldiers, greatly disheartening the French army.
    Over the past week, the American people have waged a heroic struggle against the authorities' anti-communist and anti-democratic actions. Four outstanding anti-fascist leaders, including U.S. Communist Party leader Wilson, who were previously arrested by the reactionary authorities, launched a heroic hunger strike in the Leesburg prison on the 2nd. U.S. Communist Party Chairman Foster issued a powerful call to the people on the 3rd: support the hunger strike struggle of the anti-fascist leaders and their demand for release. On the same day, representatives of trade unions and progressive groups in Detroit and Philadelphia, the "Civil Rights Congress," and others, unanimously issued the same call; and angrily protested against the U.S. reactionary authorities' frantic anti-communist and anti-people movement. The "Civil Rights Congress" also organized picket lines in front of the Department of Justice, demanding the release of the hunger-striking patriots. Awed by the power of the people, the reactionary regime was forced to release a member of the Central Committee of the U.S. Communist Party and leader of the Fur Workers Union on bail on the 3rd. On the 7th, the U.S. Federal Court was forced to allow Wilson and other four people's leaders to be released on bail, and the democratic forces achieved a preliminary and significant victory. The U.S. Third Party movement continues to gain the support of the broad masses of the people. U.S. Communist Party Chairman Foster spoke in Philadelphia at the beginning of the month, calling on U.S. "liberals to turn to the new party organized by Wallace." However, Truman's reputation has fallen to an unprecedented low as a result of his implementation of reactionary policies. There is increasing talk within the Democratic Party questioning whether he can win the election, and calls for withdrawing Truman as a presidential candidate are increasingly heard.
    The news of the week shows that the U.S. imperialists are hastily organizing a so-called "Western European Group" to promote their Marshall Plan for enslaving the people of Western Europe. Their conspiratorial steps are threefold: first, they convened a tripartite conference in London on the 23rd of last month involving the United States, Britain, and France to resolve the German question and support German fascist forces in order to lay the foundation for the Western European Group; second, they exerted pressure on the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, ordering them to sign a five-nation military and economic alliance with their servants, Britain and France, as the core of the Western European Group; third, they scheduled a sixteen-nation conference on the 15th, attempting to finally resolve the "Western European Group" issue. The fact that the U.S. imperialists will openly participate in the "Western European Group" shows how anxious they have become. Now, the development of events has confirmed the people's prediction: the so-called Marshall Plan is a war plan, and the people of Britain and Western Europe are the sacrifices. The broad masses of the people in Britain and Western Europe are now responding to this challenge from U.S. imperialism, which is in fact outwardly strong but inwardly weak, with an even more resolute struggle against the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs – the right-wing socialists.

　　国际一周
    ——三月二日至八日——
    这一周来，东方有几件值得注意的事件。
    第一、美帝扶植日本军国主义是愈发露骨了。最近，麦克阿瑟采取了在工业上复活日本军国主义的又一重要步骤，就是偷偷摸摸地把原被列入赔偿计划的一二五个军火工厂，并入生产企业，令其加速提高生产。与此同时，麦克阿瑟又竭力支持继片山组阁的芦田反动新政府，这就证明了“新内阁将比片山内阁更猛烈地奉行合于美国独占利益的政策”（日共声明）。尤其无耻的是卖国贼蒋介石，一面充当其主子的应声虫，背诵所谓“日本和约尚不及日本经济复员重要”；一面则大捧芦田内阁政纲，谓其“较片山内阁进步”，把他过去力图掩盖的奸贼面貌完全暴露出来。与芦田袍笏登场同时，是日本工潮的兴起。继上月底五十万铁道工人要求增资发动二十四小时罢工后，仙台、关西等地区的铁道工人都先后卷入罢工，工潮有延及全国之势。苏联劳动报在评日本劳动人民抗击反动派的攻势时说：“这使芦田内阁的基础极感动摇，不容它安宁或长寿”。
    第二、在美军统治下的南鲜，广大人民已洞烛美帝奴役南鲜人民的奸计，不断进行英勇的反抗。周前南鲜人民又举行了盛大游行示威，要求美军滚出朝鲜，示威群众曾奋身攻击警察局七处。目前，南鲜人民和北鲜人民一样，正继续展开反对美帝分裂与要求民主统一朝鲜的运动。
    第三、由于哈达内阁与西爪哇印尼民族败类的同流合污，使印尼人民的眼睛更加明亮，他们已起来继续进行反帝反哈达傀儡政府的坚决斗争。最近荷兰侵略者之增兵印尼，即为明证。印尼左冀劳工组织领导机关周前举行会议，决议明确地指出：要为建立新的印尼共和国人民政府而斗争，印尼职工会中央委员会已宣布采取一致行动。这足以说明：印尼少数上层分子虽然向美荷帝国主义妥协投降了，但印尼人民是决不会妥协投降的，他们将为独立与民主自由斗争到底。
    第四、越南人民正英勇地坚持正义的爱国战争。法帝国主义自去年九、十月间背信弃义进攻越南以来，即不断饱受越盟游击队的痛击，本月一日有二千五百名强大游击队袭击法国运输队，毁车辆六十二辆，击毙护送兵六十名，使法军大为丧胆。
    过去一周，美国人民进行了反对当局反共反民主的英勇斗争。前遭反动当局逮捕的美共领袖威尔逊等四个杰出的反法西斯领袖，二日在里斯岛监狱里进行英勇的绝食斗争。美共主席福斯特于三日向人民发出有力号召：支持反法西斯领袖绝食斗争及出狱要求。同日，底特律及费城各职工会及进步团体代表、“人权保障大会”等，一致发出同样呼声；并愤怒抗议美反动当局疯狂的反共反人民运动。“人权保障大会”，并在司法部前组织纠察线，要求释放绝食斗争的志士。反动政权慑于人民的声威，三日被迫将美共中委兼皮毛工会领袖交保释放，七日美联邦法院又被迫允许威尔逊等四人民领袖交保出狱，民主力量取得了初步的显著的胜利。美国第三党运动正继续获得广大人民的拥护。美共主席福斯特月初在费城演说，号召美“自由派应转向华莱士所组织的新党方向走。”但杜鲁门则由于实行反动政策的结果，声名空前低落，民主党内部已怀疑其能否在大选中赢得胜利，因而要求撤消杜鲁门为总统候选人的呼声，已日有所闻。
    一周来的消息显示：美帝正急急忙忙组织所谓“西欧集团”，以推行其奴役西欧人民的马歇尔计划，其阴谋步骤有三：一、于上月二十三日召开了美英法伦敦三国会议，解决德国问题，扶植德国法西斯势力，以奠定西欧集团之基础；二、对荷、比、卢施以压力，命令与其从仆英法签订五国军事经济同盟，作为西欧集团之核心；三、定十五日召开十六国会议，妄图最后解决“西欧集团”问题。从美帝将公开出马参加“西欧集团”一事看来，可以知道美帝对此的焦急已到达何等地步。现在，事实的发展已证实了人民的预言：所谓马歇尔计划乃是战争计划，而以英国与西欧人民为牺牲。英国与西欧的广大人民，现在也正以更坚决的反对美帝及其走狗——社会党右冀的斗争，来回答美帝国主义这一实际上是色厉内荏，外强中干的挑战。
