　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Rome Dispatch: Thirty thousand Italian municipal civil servants went on strike on the 2nd to protest against the reactionary government's violation of contracts concluded with them and its denial of allowances. The court employees' union also demanded that the Italian General Confederation of Labor protect their union rights. Furthermore, a two-day strike by three thousand radio technicians demanding wage increases ended victoriously late on the 1st. The strike had silenced seventeen Italian radio stations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Rome Dispatch: As a result of American economic aggression against Italy, it has aroused resistance from the Italian people and panic among Italian industrialists. According to L'Unità, coal miners in the Arno River basin in northwestern Italy, angered by the mine owners' threat to stop mining lignite in the basin, occupied the lignite mine in the Arrendondo area on the 1st and continued mining. This fuel is being driven out of the market by inferior American coal imported under "emergency aid." At the same time, under the cover of "emergency aid" and the "Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation," American goods are pouring into Italy, robbing many Italian companies of the possibility of selling their products and forcing them to reduce production and lay off a considerable number of workers. Italian industrialists have therefore been demanding that the Gasperi government ban the import of American goods and raw materials. Recently, the "Movement to Defend the Italian Film Industry," a group established in Rome, issued a declaration protesting against the manipulation of the Italian film market by American films, and called on the film industry and cultural circles to "unite and defend the Italian film industry by all means."

　　抗议反动当局违反合同不发津贴
  　意三十万公务员罢工
    【新华社陕北六日电】罗马讯：意三十万市政公务员于二日起罢工，抗议反动政府违反与他们缔结的合同，抵赖发给津贴。法院雇员工会并要求意总工会保护他们的工会权利。又讯：为期二天的三千名无线电技术工人要求增资的罢工，已于一日深夜胜利结束。这次罢工曾使意大利十七个电台沉寂无声。
    【新华社陕北六日电】罗马讯：由于美国经济侵略意大利的结果，已引起意国人民的反抗及意工业界的惶恐不安。据团结报载：意西北部阿诺河流域煤矿工人，为矿主以停止开采该流域褐煤相威胁所激怒，于一日占领了亚伦多区域的褐煤煤矿，并继续开采。这种燃料正为在“紧急援助”下进口的美国劣质煤逐出市场。同时美帝在“紧急援助”及“友好通商航海条约”掩护下，美货源源输入意大利，掠夺了很多意国公司出售其产品的可能性，并迫使其减低生产品及解雇相当数量的工人。意国工业界为此纷纷要求加斯贝利政府禁止美货及原料的输入。最近在罗马成立的“保卫意影片业运动”团体发表宣言，抗议美国电影操纵意影业市场，并号召电影业及文化界“团结起来，用一切办法保卫意国的电影业”。
