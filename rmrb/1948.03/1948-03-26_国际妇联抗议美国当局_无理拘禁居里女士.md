Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Dispatches from various sources: The world-renowned French female scientist and prominent democrat, Joliot-Curie (note: eldest daughter of Madame Curie, the discoverer of radium), recently traveled to the United States at the behest of the "United Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee" to deliver speeches. Upon her arrival in the United States, the U.S. judicial authorities, fearing her democratic influence, illegally detained her on Ellis Island. The Women's International Democratic Federation sent a telegram to the U.S. authorities on the 19th, expressing "extreme outrage" at this act of U.S. brutality and lodging a protest. The telegram stated: "This secretariat represents eighty million women, protesting against this act of violating individual freedom. This brutality is anti-democratic and a blatant violation of human rights. Signed by Chairman Gerton and General Secretary Weilan." At the same time, more than ten groups, including the trade union of senior academic personnel in France, the trade union of researchers, and the French Women's Federation, held meetings one after another to protest to the U.S. authorities. Professor Boulinan of the University of Paris said that this incident "made people all over the world suddenly realize where the real Iron Curtain is; how American trusts respect the great achievements of human thought." Under the pressure of these protests, the U.S. authorities were finally forced to release Curie the next day.

　　国际妇联抗议美国当局
  　无理拘禁居里女士
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方讯：世界闻名的法女科学家、著名民主人士约里埃·居里（按系镭的发现人居里夫人之长女），近奉“反法西斯难民联合委员会”之委托，赴美旅行演说，她一到美国，美国司法当局因害怕她的民主影响，即将她非法拘禁于艾里斯岛。国际民主妇女联盟于十九日致电美国当局，对美国此种暴行表示“极端震怒”，并提抗议。电文略称：“本书记处代表八千万妇女，抗议这种侵犯个人自由的暴行。这种暴行是反民主的，是对人权的公然侵犯。主席嘉东、总书记魏蓝签字。”同时法国高级学术机关人员工会，研究院工作者工会，法国妇联等十余团体，纷纷集会，向美当局提出抗议。巴黎大学教授蒲里南说，这件事“使全世界人民恍然大悟，知道真正的铁幕在那儿；美国托辣斯是怎样尊重人类思想的伟大成就的。”在这些抗议压力下，美当局终被迫于次日将居里释放。
