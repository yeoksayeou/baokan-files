　　Distinguish Merit from Demerit, Clarify Right from Wrong
　　Party Members Sincerely Reflect and Repent
　　Party-Masses Relationship in Duzhuang Initially Strengthened
　　Painful Reflection Awakens Consciousness
　　Masses Transform from Hatred to Care
　　[Wu'an News] The Duzhuang Branch was established in the anti-traitor and liquidation movement after the Japanese surrender in 1945. The branch has a total of seventeen party members, fourteen poor peasants, two middle peasants, and one rich middle peasant. The masses categorized the cadres and party members into three types: first, cadres in power; second, errand-running cadres; and third, cadres with no say. Those in charge were only the public security officer, village chief, branch secretary, chairman and vice-chairman of the farmers' association, and militia minister, totaling six people, especially the public security officer. The method by which cadres ruled the masses mainly relied on the militia. For example, arrests and fines were all carried out by the militia. The masses under their rule referred to the militia as the "Gestapo." Due to the above characteristics, the method of party rectification was to simultaneously and publicly mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers to engage in introspection with the branch. At the beginning, bad party members showed pessimism, complaint, fear of struggle. Zhang Tingyun, the public security director, was bedridden, sleeping all day long. Village chief Jia Peide tried hard to be active, seeking favors from the higher authorities. Han Qigui, the chairman of the farmers' association, tried to buy off the masses to defend his mistakes. Other party members with minor problems also regretted joining the Communist Party. Hao Tongyi said: "I only divided three catties of cotton and six feet of cloth, you can do whatever you want to me." Honest party member Zhao Kui, seeing their corruption and the opposition from the masses, had thoughts of quitting the party. Under these circumstances, class education was carried out to distinguish between good and bad, right and wrong, public and private, and to enlighten the consciousness of upright party members, initially launching ideological struggle. The masses were also brewing opinions about the cadres in preparation for party rectification. This dual approach, we initially studied and found to be better, because the party's attitude and the pressure from the masses were consistent, forming a force in the poor peasant groups. When the branch's introspection was relatively in-depth, we entered the stage of mass review.

　　On March 10th, when the new farmers' association was officially established, the party was made public. Before the Duzhuang party was made public, the masses did not know who the Communists were in their village. They only thought that Chairman Mao and the work team members from above were Communists. When the list of party members was read out, the entire venue showed surprise and tension, everyone staring at the party members. For example, Hao Tongyi's father did not believe that his son was a party member, and Zhao Kui's brother did not believe that his brother was a party member. Because several main bad cadres were all party members, it caused the masses to mistakenly believe that the Communist Party also had shortcomings, but most of the masses said that the Communist Party was good, it was just that the cadres in their village were doing bad things. Based on this situation, the masses were educated about the relationship between the masses and the party, explaining what the Communist Party was. In addition, the new farmers' association was invited to send representatives to participate in branch meetings for party rectification. The method of party rectification adopted was mass-based, with everyone offering opinions and every matter being clarified. Representatives were elected by the masses to participate, and the representatives reported the process of rectification back to the groups, and the masses further deliberated and put forward their different opinions. In order to be more democratic and directly absorb public opinion, the masses were allowed to freely audit meetings and offer opinions. At the beginning, some people expressed a left-leaning sentiment. The poor peasant and hired laborer Yang Xiaokeng had the idea of detaining bad party members and proposed that party members should not be allowed to eat at home. However, most of the representatives' attitudes and opinions were well-intentioned. In the afternoon, the problem of Zhang Tai (poor peasant), the vice-chairman of the farmers' association, was more serious. His introspection was not deep enough, and the representatives had many opinions, but they were generally fair, with some individual personal emotions. For example, Yang Xichun proposed that in the past, when he was an air-raid shelter guard, he beat people, and the vice-chairman should be responsible. The masses pointed out that Yang Xichun was bringing personal emotions, that he himself should reflect on beating people and sheltering landlords when he was an air-raid shelter guard, actually giving the person venting personal grudges a rebuttal. After the meeting, party members felt that some opinions were not true, superficially admitting them, but not convinced in their hearts. Another meeting was held with representatives participating to clarify right and wrong, and a general meeting was held for review. After internal ideological struggle and pressure from the masses, the party members gradually recognized their mistakes, felt that they had done too many things to wrong the masses. From introspection, they awakened their own class feelings and gained the love and understanding of the masses. For example, before the public security officer Zhang Tingyun reflected, the masses had many opinions about him, and were prepared to detain him. When he painfully reflected on his crimes of attacking the poor peasant and hired laborer Shen Wendi (female) and Yang Xiaokeng, he felt ashamed and sad. Under such reflection, the masses turned from resentment and dissatisfaction to care. For example, Shen Wendi proposed: As long as you honestly reflect on your mistakes, who can be without any mistakes? Seeing that he was thirsty, she poured him a bowl of water. Yang Xiaokeng also said: As long as you are like this, I have no opinion, and the knot in my stomach is untied. Hired laborer Jia Yangbao immediately said in a tone of teaching: You did these wrongs, wasn't Chairman Mao asking you to do them, blame yourselves, aren't everyone's opinions wronging you? Then a poor hired laborer Jia Conggui (blind man) said: "You don't have this condition in the party, it's you people who did bad things." Very kindly instructing the party members present, while also gaining a further understanding of the party.

　　After the review, poor peasant and hired laborer Zhao Hongxing said: "The party is a good party, it's just that you people have spoiled it (meaning done bad things)." As soon as he finished speaking, the venue immediately shouted in unison: "The party is a good party, it's just that they did bad things." Some also said: "The party is impure, it's just that these people don't listen and do wrong things." The atmosphere in the venue was harmonious, and the relationship between the party and the masses was initially improved. The representatives said as they walked: As long as they correct their mistakes, they can also participate in the farmers' association.

　　After the party members seriously examined themselves and admitted their mistakes to the masses, they participated in the farmers' association in batches. Except for militia minister Jia Qifang, who was temporarily rejected by the masses from joining the association due to his excessive corruption, now all seventeen party members in the village have sixteen who have joined the farmers' association. At first, the masses were afraid that the family members of the party member cadres would leak information to the cadres, so they were not absorbed early, but this time they were all absorbed.

　　When passing them, the masses were very cautious and serious. Those who reflected deeply passed quickly, such as Zhang Tingyun who passed as soon as he was mentioned. Those who did not reflect deeply, it was more difficult to pass, such as branch secretary Jia Hongyi who only passed after opinions were raised.

　　分清功过办明是非
  　党员心服认真反省
  　杜庄党群关系初步密切 
    痛切反省唤起自觉
  　群众由恨转到爱护
    【武安消息】杜庄支部是在四五年日寇投降后，在反奸清算运动中建立起来的，全支部党员共有十七人，贫农十四人，中农二人，富中一人。群众把干部党员评为三类：一、当权主事干部，二、跑腿干部，三、说不上话的干部。当家主事者只有公安员、村长、支书、农会正副主席、武装部长等六人，尤其是公安员。干部统治群众的方法主要是靠民兵，如打扣罚都是民兵，受统治的群众对民兵称之为“宪兵队”。由于以上的特点，整党的方法首先是公开发动贫雇与支部进行反省双管齐下，开始坏党员表现悲观、瞒怨、怕斗，公安主任张廷运卧床不起，终日睡觉，村长贾培德硬积极求得上级对他好，农会主席韩起贵则收买群众替他辩护他的错误；其他一些问题小的党员，也后悔不该参加共产党。郝同义说：“咱就多分了三斤花、六尺布，想怎整就怎整。”老实党员赵魁看着他们的贪污及群众反对，有退党思想。在这种情况下，进行阶级教育，分清好坏，分清公私是非，启发了正派的党员的觉悟，初步开展了思想斗争。群众中也酝酿对干部的意见准备整党。这种双管齐下的方针，我们初步研究比较好，因党的态度和群众的压力是一致的，在贫农组形成了力量，支部反省也比较深入的时候，即进入群众性审查。
    三月十号新农会正式成立时，即公开党。杜庄党在未公开前，群众不知道本村谁是共产党，只认为毛主席与上边来的工作员是共产党，念了党员名单，整个会场均表现十分惊奇、紧张，大家注视着党员。如郝同义的父亲不相信他儿子是党员，赵魁的弟弟不相信他哥是党员。由于几个主要坏干部都是党员，引起群众错觉认为共产党也有缺点，但大部群众说共产党是好，就是咱村干部办坏啦。根据这一情况教育群众与党的关系，讲什么是共产党，另外即聘请新农会派代表参加支部会进行整党。在整党的方法上是采取群众性的整，人人提意见，件件弄明白，由群众选出自己的代表参加，代表回小组报告整的经过，再经群众酝酿，提出他们不同意见，为了更民主能直接吸收民意，即允许了群众的自由旁听，有意见即提的方法。开始有些表露着一种左倾情绪，贫雇杨小坑即有把坏党员扣起的思想、有提出党员不准回家吃饭，但大部代表们的态度及意见是善意的。下午整农会副主任张太时（贫农）问题比较严重，他的反省不深刻，代表们意见很多，但一般公正，个别有私人情绪。如杨喜春提出过去当防空洞，打人，让副主席负责，群众提出杨喜春带私人情绪，打人、当防空洞包庇地主，应自己反省，实际是给泄私愤人一个反驳。会后党员感到有些意见不真实，表面承认，内心不服，又开会代表参加，辨明是非，大会作审查。党员经过内部的思想斗争和群众压力，逐渐认识了自己的错误，感到对不起群众的事太多；从反省中，唤起了自己的阶级情感，得到了群众的爱戴与谅解。如公安员张廷运反省前，群众对他的意见很大，准备着要扣他，当他痛心的反省了他打击贫雇申文弟（女）与杨小坑的错误罪行，感到惭愧而难过，在这样反省下，群众由愤恨不满转向了爱护。如申文弟即提出：你只要能老实反省你的错误，谁能没点错误。看到他口干，当给端了一碗水。杨小坑也说：你只要这样我就没意见了，肚里的疙瘩就开了。雇工贾羊保随即用教训的口气说：你做这些错误不是毛主席叫你来吧，怨你们自己吧，大家的意见不冤屈你们吧。接着一个贫雇贾从贵（瞎子）即说：“你们党内没有这一条件吧，是你们这些人办坏的吧。”很亲切的指教着在场的党员，同时对党也有了进一步的认识。
    审查后，贫雇赵红星即说：“党是好党，就是你们这些人给转种了（办坏的意思）。”他的话音一落，会场即异口同声的嚷着说：“党是好党，就是他们办坏了。”也有的说：“党内不纯，就是这些人不听话办错啦。”会场空气融洽，党与群众关系初步得到改善。代表边走边说：只要他们改错，参加农会也可以。
    党员认真检查了自己之后，向群众承认了错误，即分批参加入了农会。除武装部长贾起芳因腐化太利害，暂被群众拒绝入会之外，现在全村十七个党员，已有十六个参加了农会。党员干部的家属，起初群众怕他给干部通气，不早吸收，这次都吸收了。
    通过时，群众很慎重很严肃的，反省深刻的通过即快，如张廷运一提便通过了；反省的不深刻，通过时就比较困难，如支书贾红义通过时提了意见才通过。
