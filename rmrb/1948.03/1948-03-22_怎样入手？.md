　　How to Start?
    Hou Guoying
    Currently, various regions are carrying out land reform and party rectification democratic movements, and the methods and entry points differ, with different preliminary experiences created. Based on the situation we encountered upon arriving at Duzhuang Village, the middle and poor peasants' thoughts were very complex, believing that the "Land Law Outline" was like playing mahjong, dividing everything equally after a shuffle, and some even mistakenly heard "Land Law Outline" as "Developing Big Vats," meaning we should produce more, to store grain. Some believed that the "Land Law Outline" prohibited free trade, and they were afraid of violating the law even if they sold an egg. Poor peasant Jia Bao said, "I knew cadres were afraid of violating the outline when they didn't dare to wear leather coats during the New Year this year." Most cadres showed pessimism and disappointment, waiting to go to the "People's Court" (tribunal). At that time, it was already the fifteenth day of the first month (lunar calendar), and very few people were sending fertilizer to the fields. Landlords and rich peasants were secretly making sarcastic remarks: "We're not afraid this year, it's got nothing to do with us." Based on this situation, we convened a meeting of middle and poor peasants on the fifteenth day of the first month to publicize and explain the Land Law Outline and the "Message to the Peasants," repeatedly stating the attitude of the work team. At the same time, the land law was announced in the branch, and the "Message to Party Members" was explained, prohibiting them from sabotaging or lying down, and they should actively reflect on their mistakes and wait for the masses to review them. In this situation, publicly and repeatedly publicizing and explaining to the masses is to encourage the poor and hired peasants, and to unite the middle peasants. This facilitates finding and visiting the poor and hired peasants, and can quickly find the basis of the work and form a backbone force, which is faster than simply secretly visiting and finding the poor and hired peasants, and can reduce the time spent exploring at the beginning of the work. I think this is neither crude, nor rushing ahead, nor a whirlwind, but a combination of publicizing policies and meticulous mobilization of the poor and hired peasants. Publicizing and explaining the Party's policies, stating the attitude of the work team, and deeply visiting and mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, connecting and organizing the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, and uniting the middle peasants, are also closely integrated and consistent actions. This approach seems more appropriate, faster, and avoids detours. Whether it is correct or not, I would like to discuss it with everyone.
    I think it is inappropriate for the work team of Dongluotuo Village in the Fifth District of Licheng to ignore the cadres and branch (similar to kicking them aside) after arriving.
    Editor's Note: Comrade Hou Guoying wrote about his experiences and insights in his work in Duzhuang to discuss with everyone. This is very helpful for exchanging experiences and strengthening research. It is hoped that comrades from work teams (or squads) in various places will always pay attention to new experiences, problems, and small experiences in their work, and write them down for everyone to discuss and research to better promote the movement!

　　怎样入手？
    侯国英
    现在各地开展填补整党民主运动中，在作法上和入手点各有不同，都初步的创造了不同的经验。根据我们一到杜庄村碰到的情况，中贫农思想上很复杂，认为“法大纲”是和打麻将牌一样，一摸平的打乱平分，甚至还有的误听“法大纲”是“发大缸”要咱们多生产，是盛粮食用。有的认为“法大纲”是禁止买卖自由，卖个鸡蛋也怕违犯了纲。贫农家保说：“今年过年干部不敢穿皮袄，我才知道是怕违犯了大纲。”干部大多数表现是躺倒悲观失望，等着上“人民庭”（法庭）。当时已到了正月十五日（阴历），还很少有人往地里送肥。地主富农暗地说风凉话：“咱今年可不怕了，没有咱的事啦。”根据这样情况，我们在正月十五日即召开了中贫农大会，宣传讲解土地法大纲、告农民书，再三表明工作组的态度，同时在支部宣布了土地法，讲解了告党员书，不准他们破坏、躺倒，应积极反省自己的错误，等待群众审查。在这样情况下，给群众公开的反复宣传讲解，就是给贫雇鼓劲，就是团结中农，经过这样便利了找贫雇、访贫雇，可以能较快的找到工作的依托，形成骨干力量，比单纯的暗访暗找贫雇要快一些，能减少开始工作摸索的时间过长。这样作，我认为既不粗糙，也不是抢先，也不是轰轰烈烈一阵风，而是宣传政策，与具体发动贫雇的细致结合。宣传讲解党的政策，表明工作组的态度，和深入访问发动贫雇层，串通组织贫雇为骨干、团结中农，也是密切结合的一致行动的。这样作法，似乎是较为合适，来的较快，也少走弯路。是否正确，还愿与大家研究。
    黎城五区东骆驼村工作组到后，抛开干部支部不管（类似踢开），我认为是不妥当的。
    编者按：侯国英同志在杜庄工作中写来他心得和体验，与大家商讨，这样作，对于交流经验加强研究很有好处。希各地工作组（或队）同志，经常注意自己工作中新的体验、问题、点滴经验等，写来大家商讨研究更好的推进运动！
