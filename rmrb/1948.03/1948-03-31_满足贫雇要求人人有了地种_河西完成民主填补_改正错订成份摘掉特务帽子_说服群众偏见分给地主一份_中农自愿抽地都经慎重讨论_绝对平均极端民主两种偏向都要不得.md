　　Correcting Wrongly Designated Class Statuses, Removing Labels of "Special Agent"
  　Convincing the Masses to Overcome Prejudice and Allocate a Portion to Landlords
    Middle Peasants Voluntarily Contribute Land, All After Careful Discussion
  　Absolute Egalitarianism and Extreme Democracy: Both Tendencies Are Unacceptable
    [Report from Our Newspaper] The land redistribution work in Hexi Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, began on March 10th and concluded on the 24th, lasting a total of fifteen days. Before the redistribution, the entire village conducted a third class categorization, in which all those who had been struggled against participated. The results of the categorization showed that out of 120 households in the village, 14 were poor and hired peasants, 54 were new middle peasants, 39 were middle peasants, one was a rural worker, two were small vendors, seven were landlords (due to family divisions), and two were rich peasants. Landlords and rich peasants accounted for 7.5% of the total number of households in the village. Among the old middle peasant class, 22 households had been wrongly struggled against in the past. The main reason for the wrongful struggle was that during the "cutting off the tail" campaign last autumn, three generations were investigated, leading to them being labeled as "landlords." For example, Zhang Ximo's father was a teacher who owned more than 60 mu of land before 1920, as well as a mule and a donkey, and employed a long-term laborer, renting out 12 mu of land. After 1920, his economic status declined, and he had only 23 or 24 mu of land left, which he cultivated entirely himself. In 1926, when the family divided, Zhang Ximo himself received 4 mu of land. At that time, he worked as an apprentice in a small cloth shop for more than 20 years. When he returned home the year before last, he engaged in self-labor, cultivating 12 mu of land and having someone help him with 2.7 mu. He owned half a donkey, did not employ long-term laborers or hire short-term workers, and participated in mutual aid teams. Last year, he was struggled against as a landlord, but this time he was categorized as a middle peasant. Some individual middle peasants were also struggled against as landlords because they had engaged in slight exploitation in the past (before the "Double Reduction" policy). There were also nine households who had been considered "special agents" in the past and struggled against. This time, no evidence was found, and the "special agent" labels were removed. These people who had been wrongly designated and mistakenly struggled against were solemnly corrected in this class categorization and compensated in the land redistribution.

    After the class categorization, the Peasants' Association Committee absorbed some elderly people familiar with the village's land situation and assessed the yield of all the land in the village. After the committee assessed the yield, it was submitted to the Peasants' Association groups for discussion. Finally, the results of the assessment were posted. The masses crowded around to see their own assessments and inquire about others, asking others to read them aloud. At this time, some of the masses raised some objections to their own yields. Finally, the committee made separate corrections. From the posted list, it was clear that among the 120 households in the village, apart from the 10 poor and hired peasant households that had deficits, there were also 10 middle peasant households that needed to be supplemented slightly. In addition, the biggest deficits were for the 13 middle peasant households and the landlord and rich peasant households who had been wrongly struggled against in the past. In total, 119.66+ shi of land yield (they used yield as the standard for redistribution) were needed to make up the deficits.

    The formal land redistribution began on the 10th. In general, the method of self-reporting and public discussion was adopted. The specific steps were discussing the deficit households, discussing the surplus households, and evaluating the redistribution. During the discussion of the deficit households, the Peasants' Association unanimously agreed that the deficit households belonging to poor and hired peasants and some lower-middle peasants should all be compensated. However, some of the masses did not understand the issue of compensating the wrongly struggled middle peasant deficit households and giving the landlords a share of land. Their reactions were: "This time, the deficits that are being made up are all for households that were struggled against. Some of the poor peasants are losing their will to live. Isn't this just serving the landlords?" Some reflected: "Some people (referring to the wrongly struggled middle peasants) may be categorized as middle peasants today, but their ancestors were landlords, and they enjoyed happiness and exploited others from a young age. Now, giving the land back to them is really incomprehensible!" Some only saw that some middle peasants (who were wrongly struggled against) had good lives in the past, but did not look at whether they labored or exploited. They were afraid that they would get rich again after being given land this time. All these incorrect ideas were repeatedly educated and persuaded in the Peasants' Association group meetings, committee meetings, and general meetings, explaining that giving the landlords a share was to allow them to live by labor. Otherwise, they would become thieves and disrupt social order, wouldn't that be harmful to us peasants? On the issue of wrongly struggled middle peasants, it was also pointed out that no matter how their ancestors exploited people, they themselves participated in labor. If they did not labor, they would not be categorized as middle peasants today. They lived well before the struggle because they earned it through labor, and the struggle was wrong. Otherwise, who would dare to labor hard in the future? These issues were discussed in the Peasants' Association committee and groups, and the masses had a preliminary understanding of these issues. For example, Zhang [Symbol Missing] Wang (middle peasant), a member of the Peasants' Association, said, "How much firewood did the villagers lose last winter? Didn't the landlords steal it all? It's not appropriate not to give them a share." Some people among the masses also reflected: "In the past, even Zhang Bingzhong (middle peasant) was struggled against. What's the point of us engaging in production and thrift?" After the deficit households were studied and discussed by the groups, the Peasants' Association Committee reviewed them and specifically determined how much each household should be compensated. Next was the discussion of the surplus households. First, Party members and old cadres self-reported the excess land they should return, and then it was submitted to the Peasants' Association groups for public discussion. In the self-reporting by cadres and Party members, some Party members performed very well. For example, Zhang Zhengming, the Party branch secretary, did not have excess land himself, but his family had one less person last year, and the land exceeded the average yield. He voluntarily took out 1.3 mu of garden land and 3.2 mu of good land. Party member Zhang Zhenjiang also voluntarily took out 2.4 mu of ancestral land. Wang Xi, the former director of the Peasants' Association, also voluntarily returned 2.39 mu of good land. These performances were well received by the masses. After the land returned by Party members and cadres was determined, the fruit-bearing land that the masses had gained in excess was extracted. These households were all new middle peasants, and many were families of revolutionary soldiers. Because these households gained excess land, their yields generally exceeded the standard by more than one shi. Their land returns were also discussed by the groups and the committee, and most people were willing. However, there were also individual middle peasant households who were unwilling to return the excess land. For example, Zhang Chunyi's old land was already enough for the village average, but he also received one mu of dry land and 0.4 mu of garden land. When the Peasants' Association asked him to return the land, he showed great dissatisfaction and repeatedly tried to return some poor land to get away with it. Later, the Peasants' Association made appropriate concessions to him, and he returned 2 mu of poor land, leaving the 0.4 mu of garden land. His problem was then resolved. The land returns were finally passed by the Peasants' Association Committee. In total, the land returned and voluntarily contributed by Party members and cadres amounted to 22.5087 mu, equivalent to a yield of more than 20 shi. The land returned by the masses in excess amounted to more than 59 mu, equivalent to a yield of more than 40 shi. In addition, there were 23 mu of public land, equivalent to a yield of more than 17.4 dou. But overall, there was still a shortage of more than 30 shi of land yield to make up the deficits. After the Peasants' Association Committee reported this situation to the masses, some middle peasants were willing to take out their surplus land to make up the deficits. The Peasants' Association adopted an extremely cautious attitude towards this issue, repeatedly explaining to the middle peasants who voluntarily contributed land that they should not be forced if they were unwilling. At the Peasants' Association group meetings, when some middle peasants reported that they would contribute land, the Peasants' Association still let them go back and discuss it with their families before making a decision. For example, when the lower street group held a meeting, old middle peasant Zhang Duo voluntarily took out more than 4 mu of land. The Peasants' Association did not accept it on the spot, and he said angrily: "I have a lot of land (his yield averaged more than 8 shi per person, more than three times the general average, because his family lost three people last year). If you don't accept it, I will give it to others myself. Anyway, I can't cultivate it!" His problem was resolved after the Peasants' Association Committee and he himself studied it repeatedly and accepted his opinion. For example, when Zhang [Symbol Missing] Wang was studying the deficit households at the Peasants' Association Committee, he proposed to support more than 2 mu of land. This opinion was not accepted on the spot, and he raised it again the second time, but it was still not accepted. It was not until the third discussion that it was accepted. Finally, the Peasants' Association sincerely stated: "Whoever is unwilling can take the land back!" Zhang [Symbol Missing] Wang gestured and said: "I have hair on my mouth, and I can't go back on my word!" At this point, the amount of land could not only make up the deficits but also have a little surplus.

    In the final evaluation of making up the deficits, the principle determined by the Peasants' Association was: to supplement the good land with more poor land, and to supplement the poor land with more good land, and to supplement the weak labor force with nearby land. The wrongly struggled people were compensated, and the landlords were given a share. Based on these principles, the groups and the general meeting discussed the issue four times before the committee finally decided to implement it. In this process, some of the masses, especially the middle peasants, also had some biases in their thinking, the most important of which was extreme egalitarianism. Many middle peasants wanted to take out their poor land and exchange it all for good land. For example, middle peasant Zhang Qinglong had relatively more poor land, but he also had 3.5 mu of top-quality land and more than 2 mu of medium-quality land. This time, in order to take care of him, the Peasants' Association extracted some of the bad land he cultivated and supplemented him with 4 mu of good land. In this way, his yield was enough, but he was still not satisfied. He proposed at the group meeting and the general meeting: "Doesn't the Land Law say to draw from the fat and supplement the lean? Why don't you extract more of my poor land!" In fact, he still wanted more good land. His wrong thinking was criticized by the masses at the last general meeting, and the masses raised one after another: "If you don't cultivate poor land, who will?" "You already have some top-quality land, and this time you have been supplemented with 4 mu of good land, are you still not enough?" This barrage of questions made Zhang Qinglong speechless and unable to answer reasonably. Another example is carpenter Yu Gui, who has only one person, and the original land yield is more than 3 shi, and most of it is good land. This time, he was supplemented with a little medium-quality land in the redistribution, and his yield has reached more than 4 shi. He also has a craft and often works outside, but he is still not satisfied. He also proposed at the general meeting to compare himself with other single men. His reason was: "Others can be calculated according to two people, why can't I? I don't want the land given to me." His opinion was also not passed by the general meeting, and someone on the spot proposed: "You have a yield of four shi per person, plus the carpentry skills are not enough?" "You compare yourself with other single men, just compare, others are rolling in the land, you have a craft to compare what?" In short, these extremely egalitarian ideas were opposed by the masses.

    In general, in the land redistribution, in addition to first satisfying the poor and hired peasants (the 10 households lacking land were supplemented to the average yield, and the quality was also taken care of), 13 middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against were appropriately compensated. In addition to returning the land confiscated during the "cutting off the tail" campaign last autumn, some households were also supplemented with some land. In addition, although 15 middle peasants voluntarily took out some land—mostly poor and fragmented land—after they took it out, not only did their burden reduce, but also a lot of labor was saved, which was relatively beneficial to them. But there were still 10 middle peasants who were given land, and some middle peasants, although they voluntarily contributed dry land, were supplemented with garden land. For example, middle peasant Yintang contributed 2.8 mu of land, but he wanted to plant some gardens, and the Peasants' Association adjusted 0.8 mu of garden land for him. The same was true for old middle peasant Zhang Shang. After the redistribution, the middle peasants had the most land and the highest yield in the whole village.

    However, in the entire work process, some detours were still taken. The main reason was that from the comrades of the work team to the new village cadres, they all had extremely democratic ideas, showing that they did not dare to be bold and responsible, and everything had to be taken to the general meeting or group discussion, and some had to be discussed four or five times, which delayed the work for several days.

    After the land redistribution was completed, the houses were adjusted and the floating wealth that the cadres had returned in excess was distributed. The principles of adjusting the houses were: (1) The houses of the landlords were distributed to the poor and hired peasants. (2) The wrongly struggled middle peasants were compensated with better houses. The specific method was: "First, the Peasants' Association Committee (absorbing the heads and deputy heads of each group and one representative to participate) discussed and came up with a preliminary result, announced it at the plenary meeting, let everyone make suggestions, and finally convened a meeting with the households related to the adjustment of houses, put forward individual specific opinions on the houses, self-reported and publicly discussed, and finally decided. The intermediate process was the same as the land redistribution, through repeated discussions, and overcoming various incorrect opinions."

    As a result of the distribution, nine poor and hired peasants lived in the best houses. The old man Lao Lai Suo, who had not turned over in the past, said: "The land is fine, and the houses have been distributed to good houses. This time, I am really satisfied." The wrongly struggled middle peasants generally returned to their original good houses, and the seven new middle peasant households who lacked houses were also adjusted to have houses. A lower-middle peasant was also given a better yard. In the distribution of floating wealth, the poor and hired peasants were also satisfied first. The poor and hired peasant households who had received the least fruit in the past received the best things this time, but because there was very little fruit, on the one hand, it was necessary to compensate the wrongly struggled middle peasants, so each person only received one or two items. In addition to distributing grain to the three old and weak poor and hired peasant households, most of the grain was distributed to the wrongly struggled middle peasants who lacked grain, and the six landlord households also received grain, so that they could carry out production. (Editor's note: According to the comrades of the Hexi Work Team, the democratic redistribution in the village is only the beginning, and the experience is not yet mature. Therefore, it is only for reference to other places.)

　　满足贫雇要求人人有了地种
  　河西完成民主填补
    改正错订成份摘掉特务帽子
  　说服群众偏见分给地主一份
    中农自愿抽地都经慎重讨论
  　绝对平均极端民主两种偏向都要不得
    【本报消息】武安九区河西村的土地抽补工作，开始于三月十日，至廿四日告一段落，历时共十五天。在抽补前全村进行了第三次划阶级，被斗户均参加。划的结果，全村一百二十户中，贫雇农十四户，新中农五十四户，中农三十九户，乡村工人一户，小商贩两户，地主七户（因为分家的结果），富农两户。地主富农占全村户数百分之七·五。在老中农阶层中，有二十二户是过去斗错了的，错斗的原因，最主要的是在去秋“割尾巴”时，查三代查成“地主”的。例如张锡模，他父亲是教员，民国九年前有六十多亩地，骡、驴各一头，雇长工一个，出租土地十二亩，民国九年以后即下降，土地只剩二十三、四亩，完全自己耕种。民国十五年分家，张锡模本人分了四亩地，那时他在一家小布庄当了学徒，干了二十多年。前年回家后，即自己劳动，种的十二亩地，让别人伴种着二亩七分，有半头驴，不雇长工也不觅短工，参加互助变工。去年被当做地主斗争，这次划成中农。有个别中农，因过去（双减以前）有轻微剥削，亦被当做地主斗争。尚有九户过去被认为“特务”而被斗争了的，这次查无证据，把“特务”帽子都摘掉了。这些过去被错订成份误斗的，在这次划阶级中，均经郑重改正，并在填补中补偿了。
    划阶级以后，紧接着就由农会委员会吸收一部分年老熟悉本村土地情形的人，评定全村所有土地的产量。委员会评定后，交由农会小组讨论，最后又把评的结果出了榜。榜贴出以后，群众都拥挤着争看自己的，并打听别人的，要别人念给他听。这时有的群众对自己的产量又提出了一些意见，最后又经委员会分别加以改正。从榜上很明显的看出，全村一百二十户中，除十户贫雇是窟窿外，还有十户中农也还得少填补一下，此外最大的窟窿，就是过去错斗的十三户中农及地主富农。总计还需要一一九·六六多石产量的土地（他们抽补是以产量为标准）才能补起窟窿来。
    从十日开始正式进行抽补，方式上一般的均采取了自报公议，具体步骤是讨论窟窿户、讨论圪堆户、评议抽补。在讨论窟窿户过程中，属于贫雇农及一部分下中农的窟窿户，农会均一致同意要都给补起来，但对补斗错的中农窟窿户及给地主一份土地问题上，有些群众思想不通。他们的反映是：“这次补的窟窿尽是斗争户，贫农活没意思的几户，这还不是给地主服了务”。有的反映是：“有些人（指斗错的中农）今天虽然划成中农了，但他祖上是地主，他也从小享过福，剥削过人，现在把地又还给他，实在想不通！”也有的人光看过去有些中农（斗错的）生活好，而不看劳动不劳动，剥削不剥削？怕这次给了地以后又发了家。所有这些不正确的思想，在农会小组会上、委员会上、大会上，均反复进行了教育与说服，说明给地主一份，是叫他们劳动过活。不然，他们当了小偷，扰乱社会秩序，那还不是咱农民的害？对斗错的中农问题上，也指出了不管他祖上怎样剥削人，但他本人是参加劳动的，如果他不劳动，今天就不会订他中农，斗争以前他们生活好，是劳动得来的，斗了不应该，不然以后谁还敢好好劳动？这些问题在农会委员会中及小组中，都进行了讨论，群众对这些问题才有初步的认识。如农会委员张＠旺（中农）说：“去年冬天咱村老百姓的柴火丢了多少，还不是都叫地主们偷了，不给他们一份也是不合适”。群众中也有人反映：“过去象张丙中（中农）都斗了，咱们还搞个啥生产节约？”所有窟窿户经小组研究讨论后，最后由农会委员会审查，并具体的确定了那户补多少。接着就是讨论圪堆户，首先是由党员与旧干部自报应退的多得土地，然后交由农会小组公议。在干部党员自报中，有些党员表现很好，如支书张正明，自己并未多得土地，但他家去年去了一口人，土地超出平均产量，他自动的拿出园地一亩三分，好地三亩二分，党员张镇江也自动拿出了自己祖业地二亩四分；旧农会主任王喜，也自动退出了好地二亩三分九，他们这些表现，均博得群众的好评。党员干部退地确定以后，即抽动群众中多得之果实土地。这部分人全是新中农，有不少是抗属。这些户由于多得了土地，产量一般均超过水平一石以上。他们退地也都经小组公议和委员会讨论，多数人都愿意。不过也有个别中农户不愿退出多得之土地。如张纯义，他的老地亩就已够本村平均水平，但还得了一亩旱地与四分园，农会让他退地时，表现很大不满，三番五次的想退点赖地了事。以后农会对他做了适当的让步，他退出二亩赖地，留下了四分园，他的问题才得到解决。退地最后经农委会讨论通过。总计：党员、干部退出与自动献出的土地共二二五○八七亩，合产量二十石多一点，群众中退出多得之土地共五十九亩多，合产量四十石多一点，加上公地二十三亩，合产量十七石四斗多。但总起来，还差三十余石产量的地才能补窟窿，这个情形农会委员会向群众报告后，有一些中农愿意拿出自己的多余的土地来补窟窿。农会对此问题，采取了极其慎重的态度，再三再四的向自动出地的中农解释，如果不愿意就不要勉强，在农会小组上有的中农自报拿地时，农会仍让他们回去和家里人商量一下，当下不作决定。如下街小组开会时，老中农张多自愿拿出四亩多地来，农会当场未接受，他即很生气的说：“我的地很多（他的产量平均每人八石多，超过一般平均数三倍多，原因是他家去年去掉三口人），你们不接受，我也要自己给了别人，反正我种不过来”！他的问题经过农会委员和他本人再三研究，才接受了他的意见。又如张＠旺在农会委员会上研究窟窿户时，他就提出要拥护二亩多地，当场没有接受这个意见，第二次他又提出来也未接受，直到第三次讨论时才接受了，最后农会又诚恳的声明：“谁不愿意，地还可以拿回去”！张＠旺比划着说：“我嘴上有毛，说了话不能不算了”！至此土地数量除补窟窿外还可富余一点。
    在最后评议补窟窿时，农会确定的原则是：好地多的补点赖地，赖地多的补点好地，劳动力弱的补近地。错斗的补偿，地主分给一份根据这些原则，先后在小组与大会讨论了四次，最后才由委员会决定执行。在这一过程中，有些群众特别是中农，思想上也存在一些偏向，其中最主要的是极端平均主义。有不少的中农都想把自己的赖地推出全换成好地，比如中农张庆龙赖地比较多，但也有三亩半顶好地、二亩多中等地。农会这次为了照顾他，把他种的坏地抽出了一点；又补给了四亩好地。这样一来，他的产量已够了，但他还不满足。他在小组会上、大会上均提出：“土地法不是抽肥补瘦？我的赖地多为啥不再抽些！”实际上他是还想再要好地。他的这个错误思想在最后一次大会上遭到了群众批判，群众纷纷提出：“你不种赖地叫谁种？”“你就有些顶好地，这次又给你补了四亩好地，你还不足？”这一大堆质问，使得张庆龙闭口无言，无理回答了。又如木匠玉贵，只他一口人，原有土地产量即有三石多，而且好地居多，这次抽补中又给他补了一点中等地，他的产量己达四石多了；他还有手艺，经常在外做活，这样他还不满足。在大会上也提出了要和别的光棍比，他的理由是：“别人都能按两口算，我就不能？给我的地不要”他这个意见，也同样没有被大会通过，有人当场就提出：“你一个人四石产量，加上木匠手艺还不够”？“你和别的光棍比，比就比比，别人都是滚土地，你有手艺还比个啥”？总之这些极端平均主义的思想，都遭到群众的反对。
    总的说来，抽补土地中，除首先满足了贫雇外，（十户缺地少地的均补足了平均产量，而且在质量上也都有照顾）并适当的补偿了十三户被误斗的中农。他们除去秋“割尾巴”时，没收的土地归还了以外，有的户还补给了他们一些；另外虽然有十五户中农自动拿出一些土地——大多是赖地碎地，他们拿出以后，不但负担减轻，而且劳力上也节省出不少，对他们相对的是有利的。——但还有十户中农分进了土地，有些中农虽然自动拥护出了旱地，但又补给了园地，如中农银堂拥护出二亩八分地，但他想种点园，农会又给他调剂了八分园，老中农张尚也是如此。而填补后全村比较，土地多产量高的全系中农。
    可是在整个工作过程中，仍是走了一些弯路，主要的原因是，从工作组同志到新村干，都有极端民主的思想，表现不敢大胆负责，任何事情都要拿到大会或小组讨论，而且有的要讨论四五次，使工作拖延了好几天。
    土地填补完毕，即进行调剂房子及分配干部退出多得的浮财。调剂房子的原则：（一）地主的房子分配给贫雇。（二）斗错的中农补偿较好的房子，具体作法：“先由农委会（吸收各组正副组长及代表一人参加）讨论，得出初步结果，在全体会上宣布，让大家提意见，最后召集与调剂房子有关户开会，提出个人对房子的具体意见，自报公议，最后决定，中间也与填补土地时一样，经过反复讨论，并克服各种不正确意见。”
    分配的结果，九户贫雇都住了最好的房子，过去没翻身的老来琐说：“地也行了，房子也分了好房子，这回真是满意了。”斗错的中农一般都回到了原来的好房，缺房子的七户新中农户也都调剂了房子，一下中农，也分给了一个较好的院子。在分配浮财上也是首先满足了贫雇，过去分得果实最少的贫雇户这次都分得了最好的东西，不过因为果实很少，一方面还要补偿错斗的中农，所以每人只分了一两件，粮食除分配给三户老弱的贫雇外，大部分都分给了缺少粮食的错斗了的中农，地主六户也都分到了粮食，使他们能够进行生产。（编者按：据河西工作组同志说，该村民主填补系属初作，经验还不成熟，因此，仅供各地参考。）
