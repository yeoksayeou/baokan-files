Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 23rd: Since the Chiang Kai-shek clique launched the civil war, its blood-sucking ruling apparatus has expanded to an alarming extent. According to a Nanjing dispatch from the reactionary Tianjin Yishi Bao on the 12th of last month, quoting the Chiang Kai-shek clique's responsible authorities, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "central" level civil and military officials, soldiers, and hired laborers alone have reached 10 million: namely, 5 million soldiers, 3 million public education personnel, and 2 million Chiang Kai-shek clique's cultural workers and technical workers. According to more accurate statistics from various materials, this total number is at least 8 million. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army was less than 2 million. Currently, the Chiang Kai-shek army has more than 500,000 (536,913) officers and more than 4 million (4,020,849) soldiers, totaling more than 4.5 million (4,557,762) (according to the Shanghai newspapers' disclosure of the Chiang Kai-shek army's officers and soldiers' salary list from October to December last year). The hundreds of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek police and professional armed secret agents are not included in this calculation. The Chiang Kai-shek government's "central" level civil servants: a total of more than 960,000 (960,213) civil servants (according to the Jingbao's disclosure of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's計處 (Accounting Office) year-end statistics of this year's budget personnel), and at least half of this number for hired laborers, i.e., 480,000, totaling more than 1.4 million. This is a sixteen-fold increase compared to the 80,000 before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and more than a two-fold increase compared to the 450,000 (i.e., 300,000 civil servants and 150,000 public laborers) in April 1946 at the beginning of the civil war. All Chiang Kai-shek's official school faculty and staff, the Chiang Kai-shek's brainwashing cultural organs densely covering the entire Chiang-controlled area, the technical staff of arsenals and Chiang Kai-shek's official enterprises, and the jailers and wardens in Chiang Kai-shek's prisons and concentration camps are not included in the statistics. If all these figures are included, the number of "central" level personnel in the Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary apparatus is at least 8 million.

　　The Chiang Kai-shek provincial-level institutions have also greatly expanded since the civil war. Before the autumn of 1939, at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the total number of staff in each provincial government of the Chiang Kai-shek clique was only 400 to 500. At the beginning of the civil war, in early 1946, it was only 3,000 to 4,000, but now it is often more than 20,000. For example, according to the statistics of Hubei Province at the beginning of this year, the Chiang Kai-shek provincial-level civil service had 5,664 personnel, 810 military officers, 12,210 soldiers, 3,500 long-term hired laborers, and 2,250 workers, totaling more than 24,000 (24,434) people. The Chiang Kai-shek civil servants in Anhui Province are about 8,000; the civil personnel in Jiangxi Province also reached 6,300, which is even more than the same type of personnel in Hubei Province. The Chiang Kai-shek institutions below the provincial level have also expanded compared to the past. According to an article published in the Shanghai-based American-owned Millard's Review on January 10th this year, the number of these personnel is estimated to be about 9 million. The author also estimates the total number of Chiang Kai-shek's entire and all levels of ruling institutions to be 17 million, accounting for about 6% of the 300 million people in the entire Chiang-controlled area, and this does not include those temporarily mobilized by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the civil war.

　　Such a huge apparatus is the tool for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to carry out counter-revolutionary civil war dictatorship and for the four major families to oppress and exploit the people. In order to feed the personnel in this huge apparatus, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has imposed an increasingly intolerable financial burden on the people. On the 5th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek's 行政院長 (President of the Executive Yuan) Zhang Qun declared that in the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "central" level general budget of 96 trillion yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency) for the first half of this year, the living expenses of the Chiang Kai-shek military officers and soldiers and the Chiang Kai-shek's government's public educators actually accounted for a total of 63 trillion yuan (according to a Nanjing dispatch from the Chiang Kai-shek's Beiping Pingming Daily). On the 12th of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek's responsible authorities even claimed that the Chiang Kai-shek government would disregard rising prices (i.e., disregard the life and death of the people) and "concentrate all its efforts" to seek the satisfaction of the living problems of the 10 million people in the Chiang Kai-shek's "central" level institutions (see the aforementioned Yishi Bao).

　　蒋匪统治机构膨胀
    各级人数总共有一千七百万
    给人民不能忍受的财政负担
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】自蒋匪发动内战以来，其吸血统治机构已扩大到惊人程度。据反动的天津益世报上月十二日南京专电引蒋匪主管当局谈话，仅蒋匪“中央”一级文武官员、兵士、雇役已达一千万人：即军队五百万，公教人员三百万，及蒋匪文化工作者与技术工人二百万。另据各方材料作比较准确统计，此项总人数至少亦达八百万人。抗战前蒋匪军队不足两百万，目前蒋军官佐达五十余万（五三六、九一三）人，士兵四百余万（四、○二○、八四九）人，共计四百五十余万（四、五五七、七六二）人（据沪报披露蒋匪军官兵去年十月至十二月薪给表）。以数十万计的蒋匪警察及职业武装特务尚未计算在内。蒋政府“中央”级文职人员：公务员共九十六万（九六○、二一三）余人（据京报披露蒋匪主计处去年年底统计之今年预算员额），工役至少为此数之半，即四十八万人，合计共达一百四十万人以上。较之抗战前的八万人增加十六倍，较内战初期的一九四六年四月的四十五万人（即公务员三十万，公役十五万），亦已骤增两倍以上。所有蒋匪官立学校教职员工，密布全蒋区的蒋匪愚民文化机关员工，兵工厂及蒋匪官办企业技术员工，与蒋匪监狱及集中营内的禁子牢头之类均未统计在内。如将各项人数均计入，则在蒋匪反革命机构内“中央”级的人数至少亦为八百万人。
    蒋匪省级机构自内战以来亦已大为膨胀，抗战初期即一九三九年秋季前蒋匪每个省政府职员合计仅四五百人，内战初期即一九四六年初尚仅三四千人，目前则动辄在两万人以上。例如湖北省今年初的统计，蒋匪省级文职公务员五、六六四人，武职官佐八一○人，士兵一二、二一○人，长雇夫役三、五○○人，工友二、二五○人，合计共达二万四千余（二四、四三四）人。安徽省蒋匪文职公务员约为八千人；江西省文职人员亦达六千三百人，均较湖北省同类人员尤多。蒋匪省级以下机构较前也已膨胀，据今年一月十日沪美商密勒氏评论报刊文估计，此项人数约为九百万人，作者并将蒋匪全部及各级统治机构人数估计为一千七百万人，约占全蒋区三亿人口的百分之六，而蒋匪在内战中临时动员者尚未计入。
    这样庞大的机构就是卖国贼蒋介石进行反革命内战独裁，与四大家族压迫剥削人民的工具。为着养活这个庞大机构内的人员，蒋匪就加给人民以日益不能忍受的财政负担。上月五日蒋匪行政院长张群宣称，今年上半年蒋匪“中央”级总预算九十六万亿元（蒋币）中，蒋军官兵及蒋家公教人员生活费竟共占六十三万亿元（据北平蒋匪平明日报南京专电）。上月十二日蒋匪主管当局更声称，蒋匪政府将不顾物价上涨（按即不顾人民死活），而“集中全力”谋求蒋匪“中央”级机构中一千万人生活问题之满足（见前益世报）。
