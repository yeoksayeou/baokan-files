Experiences and observations from Party rectification in Duzhuang:

	During the Party rectification, we should always believe in and rely on the masses. However, it is essential to raise the class consciousness of the masses and to review Party members with a serious and responsible attitude. This can prevent the "leftist" emotions of the masses at the beginning and enable Party members to consciously reflect on their mistakes.
	Because they had been directly hit by Party member cadres, Duzhuang villagers like Yang Xiaohang, Ma Tang's wife, and Ma Jiabao and others initially felt that it was too cheap for Party members to reflect on their mistakes and return the over-occupied fruits of labor; they insisted that they should pay back everything (meaning to beat them up). Yang Xiaohang openly said with great resentment: "Even if it costs me my old life, I will fight the public security officer to the death." When the work team comrades heard these reactions, they should calmly consider the situation, but they should not simply defend against or allow "leftist" emotions to grow. Instead, they should actively persuade and educate the masses, inspire and improve the masses' courage to struggle through reasoning, and should express the Communist Party's attitude towards Party members who have made mistakes (the tone should be affirmative). Party members must admit their mistakes to the masses, must correct them, make amends if necessary, apologize if necessary, and do whatever is required. At the same time, the "Letter to Party Members" and "Letter to Peasants" should be repeatedly explained to the masses and Party members. This can increase the courage of the masses and promote the self-reflection of Party members. More importantly, give Party lectures to the masses, explaining what the Communist Party under the leadership of Chairman Mao does. After such patient persuasion and education to raise the class consciousness of the masses, the attitude toward Party members gradually changed from hatred to transformation and education. For example, public security officer Zhang Tingyun honestly confessed all his wrongdoings at the meeting. Poor peasants like Ma Tang's wife and Yang Xiaohang all said in unison: "Since you have put down your airs, admitted your mistakes, and will correct them in the future, the knot in my stomach has been untied." Seeing that he was thirsty after talking, Ma Tang's wife quickly poured him a bowl of boiled water. Poor peasant Jia Xigui said: "These bad things you did, are they part of the Communist Party's rules? You did them yourselves, right?" Hired worker Jia Yangbao said: "These things you did, did Chairman Mao teach you to do them? Did you change your nature yourself?" Other middle and poor peasants criticized and reprimanded the Party members who had made mistakes. Such kind guidance from the masses to the Party members is a manifestation of the masses' ideological awareness and the improvement of their class consciousness. It is a sincere expression of love for the Communist Party and helping the transformation of the Communist Party members. Therefore, we believe that in the democratic Party rectification movement, we should implement "Four Talks" according to the actual ideological situation of the masses at various stages: talk about the Communist Party, talk about democracy, talk about policy, and talk about class. Of course, dogmatic, unrealistic, and empty talk is useless.

　　杜庄整党点滴体验
    在整党中，应始终相信群众依靠群众，但必须提高群众阶级觉悟，以严肃负责的态度去审查党员。这样既可免除群众开始时“左”的情绪，又可使党员自觉的反省错误。
    杜庄群众杨小杭、马堂老婆、马家保等人，因他们都直接受过党员干部的打击，开始认为党员反省错误退出多占果实太便宜了，他们非吃啥还啥不行（扣打之意）。杨小杭开始很愤怨的公开说：“就是我这个老命，非和公安员拼了不行。”这时工作组同志听到这些反映，应当冷静考虑，但也不能单纯处于防御和放任“左”的情绪滋长，而应当积极的说服教育群众，启发与提高群众说理斗争勇气，并应表明共产党对犯了错误党员的态度（语气应肯定），党员有错误必须向群众承认，必须改正，该赔情的赔情，该道歉的道歉，该怎办就怎办。同时再将告党员书、告农民书反复的向群众党员讲解，这样可以增加群众的勇气与促进党员的反省；更重要的一点是，给群众上党课，讲解毛主席领导下的共产党是干啥事，经过这样耐心的说服教育提高群众的阶级觉悟，认为毛主席的党是为人民办事的，由开始对党员仇恨态度，逐渐变成改造教育态度。如公安员张廷运，在大会上很老实的将自己的错误行为一一说出，贫雇马堂老婆、杨小杭等人都异口同声的说：“你这样下了架子，承认错误，以后改正，我肚里的疙瘩就解开了。”马堂老婆看见他谈的口渴，就很快的给他倒了一碗开水端过。贫农贾喜贵说：“你作的这些坏事，共产党内没有这一条吧？是你们自己作坏的吧？”雇工贾羊保说：“你作的这些事不是毛主席教你来吧？是你自己变了种吧？”其他中贫农都对犯错误的党员进行了批评与指责。群众对党员这样亲切的指教，是群众思想自觉与阶级觉悟的提高，是诚恳的爱护共产党，帮助共产党员的改造的表现。因此我们认为在民主整党运动中，应根据群众的各个时期思想实际贯彻四讲：讲共产党、讲民主、讲政策、讲阶级。当然教条式的不合实际，空讲是不济事的。
