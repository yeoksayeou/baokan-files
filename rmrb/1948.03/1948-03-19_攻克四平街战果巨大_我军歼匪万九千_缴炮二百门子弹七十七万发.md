Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th—The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued Operation Bulletin No. 29, announcing the process and results of capturing the strategic central city of Siping Street: Our field army first occupied the Siping West Suburb Airport with a portion of its forces on the evening of the 5th. From the 7th to the 9th, we cleared the enemy's peripheral strongholds in three directions—north, southwest, and southeast—including Sandaolinzi, Haifengtun, Xinlitun, and Zhema Bei, completing a tight encirclement of the enemy entrenched in modern city defense fortifications. At 8:00 AM on the 12th, our army launched a general offensive from three sides. After the artillery carried out effective bombardment, the infantry quickly launched an assault, bravely breaking through the city walls, seizing the enemy's group bunkers one by one, and gradually dividing the enemy's defense system. By 3:00 PM that day, we had completely eliminated the enemy west of the railway, and then the three routes converged, directly attacking the stubbornly resisting enemy entrenched in the core fortifications east of the railway, engaging in house-to-house fighting. Finally, we compressed the enemy into a small area of Gongrong Street and North 1st Wei Road, annihilating them all in one fell swoop. This battle lasted 23 hours, completely annihilating 19,000 enemy troops, including the 88th Division of the 71st Army, a cavalry regiment, three security regiments, the 71st Army's 87th Division, the 91st Division and other units' garrison offices, the 91st Division's cadre education team, the puppet Liaobei Provincial Government and its security forces. Thus, the entire territory of Liaobei Province has been recovered by us.
