Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters issued its 28th War Bulletin, announcing the recovery of Yongji, the capital of Jilin Province, and the results of the battle as follows:

　　The more than 30,000 troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 60th Army's three divisions, the First and Second Security Brigades, and the First Security Regiment, etc., were besieged in the isolated city of Yongji by our local forces. Recently, with the capture of famous cities and important ports such as Liaoyang, Anshan, and Yingkou, they were extremely frightened. Coupled with hunger and cold, they had no choice but to adopt escape tactics. On the 8th, they destroyed and burned Jilin's buildings and the Xiaofengman Power Station's equipment, abandoning the city at 7:00 PM in the evening and fleeing. A part of our army immediately recovered this strategic city and the world-renowned Xiaofengman Power Station, and tracked and pursued the fleeing bandits. In the pursuit by our local forces in the Zhujiatun, Bonihezi, and Dasuihe areas, more than 20 miles west of Jilin, we annihilated more than 4,000 enemy troops in two days. The bandits, upon hearing the sound of gunfire, fell into extreme chaos, burning more than 50 trucks loaded with wealth and abandoning property all along the way, managing to escape into the isolated city of Changchun on the 11th.

　　Preliminary statistics of the battle results: 4,139 enemy troops were annihilated, including 3,240 captured alive and 899 killed or wounded. 40 various artillery pieces were seized, including: 1 howitzer, 6 anti-tank guns, 4 direct-fire guns, 1 anti-aircraft gun, 2 rocket launchers, 2 mortars, and 24 60mm mortars. Also captured were 2 grenade launchers, 51 light and heavy machine guns, 62 submachine guns, 3 automatic rifles, 934 rifles and carbines, 3 rifle grenade launchers, more than 400 artillery shells, more than 250,000 rounds of various bullets, 4 trucks, 10 radio stations, 68 telephones, 20 switchboards, 238 war horses, more than 70 million yuan in bandit currency, and many other supplies.
