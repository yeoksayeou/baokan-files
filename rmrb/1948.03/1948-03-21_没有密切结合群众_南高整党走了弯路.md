    【Shahe News】After the work team entered Nangaocun Village, they first approached Li Wu and Wang Zaoqun, poor and hired peasants who had not been thoroughly liberated, and learned about some of the materials concerning cadres and Party members. Their main problems were beating people and serious administrative commandism, and some were protecting landlords. The issue of reversing verdicts was widespread. At that time, Party rectification began. All Party members, regardless of the severity of their mistakes, were gathered together for introspection. Although they were allowed to go home to sleep at night, in fact, it seemed as if they were being held in custody. In leadership, there was little enlightenment and much criticism, and relentless questioning. This was the first stage of Party rectification. During this period, Party members were most distressed and panicked, saying things like, "Why did we join this? If we had known it would be like this, we would never have joined." Therefore, they dared not talk about their mistakes openly, and only reluctantly admitted a few minor ones. This stage was not very effective.

    In the second stage, attention was paid to class education, explaining the significance of Party rectification, and enlightening Party members to consciously reflect on their mistakes. Representatives of the masses (five or six, or twenty or more) were also absorbed to participate. At this time, some Party members with minor mistakes took the initiative to reflect first, and the leadership seized on their reflections to help them recognize their mistakes and consciously raise the Party members' awareness. This broke the dull atmosphere of the previous stage, and Party members began to feel interested. Party members with more serious mistakes also talked about some of their mistakes under the pressure of the masses, but they were still not fully conscious.

    The third stage was for Party members to reflect at mass meetings and be reviewed by the masses. At the first meeting, Party members with major mistakes were asked to reflect first. Apart from three or four people who had been attacked by cadres who raised opinions, the masses did not speak. This meeting was a failure. The main reasons were: (1) Although the leadership explained to the masses that Party members and cadres should be reviewed by the masses, the masses' understanding was not clear enough. For example, after the meeting, the masses said, "We can't find the way, how can we speak? Those who have been attacked exaggerate the facts and are not raising opinions for everyone; they are just seeking revenge. But we dare not raise opinions at the meeting, and we are afraid of suppressing others' speeches." This shows that the masses had not fully deliberated and discussed before the meeting was convened, which was a case of impatience. (2) Originally, the Party rectification meeting was meant to raise the class consciousness of the masses and Party members, but the leadership did not have a clear purpose in this regard before the meeting, which was a sign of blindness.

    After review, a new peasant association was convened to discuss with the masses how to carry out Party rectification. At that time, the masses suggested that Party members with minor mistakes should be reviewed first. The leadership listened to the opinions of the masses and convened another meeting. Their reflections were better, which not only enlightened the masses but also enlightened other Party members. The masses also criticized Party members. For example, Song Suo criticized Qiao Ping (a Party member), saying, "Although your mistakes are not big, you are not a very good Party member either, because you do not work hard, you try to please both sides, and you have not served the masses enough."

    After this review, only one Party member with major mistakes was not approved by the masses. The others who had been reviewed by the masses were only awaiting processing according to the severity of their mistakes.

    After the meeting, the masses said, "Most of the bad things that Party members confessed in the meeting, people don't understand if they don't say them. If the bad things they have done can be corrected, then they are good Party members."

### 没有密切结合群众　南高整党走了弯路

    没有密切结合群众　南高整党走了弯路
    【沙河消息】南高村工作组进村以后，首先接近没翻透身的贫雇李五的、王皂群等人，了解到干部、党员一部分材料，他们主要毛病是吊打人及严重的行政命令作风，还有的包庇地主，翻身高是普遍的。当时就开始进行整党。把全体党员，不分错误轻重，全部集中起来反省。虽然夜间允许他们回家睡觉，但在事实上已成了似乎是住看守所的样子，在领导上是启发少、批评多，追根硬卡，这是整党的第一阶段。这一段当中，党员最苦闷、并且很恐慌，如说：“怎样来咱们参加了这个？知道这样万也不参加。”因此他们有错误，不敢大胆谈，不得已，也只避重就轻的谈出来一点。这一段，收效很小。
    到第二阶段，注意了阶级教育，讲明整党意义，启发党员自觉反省，并吸收了群众代表参加（五、六人，二十余人不等）。这时就有些错误小的党员，自动提出先反省，领导上就抓住他的反省，帮助他认识错误，有意识的提高党员的觉悟。这样一来，打破前一段的沉闷局面，党员开始感到有兴趣；错误较大的党员，在群众的压力下，也谈出了一部分错误，但还是不自觉的。
    第三个阶段是党员在群众大会上反省，交群众审定。第一次大会，是叫错误大的党员先反省，会上除了三四个被干部打击过的人提意见外，群众都不发言，这次会失败了。主要原因是：（一）领导上虽然给群众讲解，党员干部要经群众审查，但群众了解还不明确，如散会后，群众说：“我们找不着路，怎能发言。被打击过的人他们提意见，夸大事实，不是为大家提意见，他们光是报复心，但我们当会也不敢提意见，又怕打击了人家发言。”这说明群众还没有酝酿讨论成熟，就召开了会议，犯了急性病。（二）本来经过整党大会，要提高群众和党员的阶级觉悟，但在会前领导上这个目的性不明确，有盲目性。
    检讨后，召开了新农会，和群众商量如何整党。当时群众提出，先审定错误小的党员，领导上就听了群众意见，又召开了大会，他们反省较好，不但启发了群众，也启发了其他党员。群众对党员也做了批判，如宋锁的对乔平的（党员）提意见说：“你的错误虽不大，但你也不是很好的党员，因为你作工作不努力，你两头落好，你没给群众服了多的务”。
    经过这一次审查，只有一个错误大的党员群众不通过，其他已经群众审定过的，只待根据其错误大小，分别处理。
    会后群众说：“党员在会场反省出来的坏事，大部分人家不说咱不了解，他们做过的坏事，说出来能改，就是好党员。”
