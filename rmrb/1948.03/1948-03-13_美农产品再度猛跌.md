　　New York dispatch: The economic turmoil in the United States is becoming increasingly dangerous. The prices of agricultural products plummeted again on the 8th and 9th. According to the Associated Press, on the 8th, corn and soybean futures in Chicago both fell to the limit of eight points (according to the practice of the American exchange, if the price rises or falls to the pre-determined limit, the market will be evaluated on that day). Wheat and oats also fell sharply. The price of cotton in New York fell by as much as six dollars per bale on the 8th. The Associated Press said that this was the most severe price drop since the price collapse last month. When the market opened on the 9th, various grain prices continued to plummet, with wheat falling 6.7 cents per bushel, corn falling 7.5 cents, and oats falling 3 cents. At the same time, the prices of various major stocks in New York also fell generally on the 8th and continued to fall on the 9th, with only a small number of transactions.

　　美农产品再度猛跌
    【新华社陕北十一日电】纽约讯：美国的经济波澜愈来愈险。农产品的价格八、九两日又发生暴跌。据合众社说：芝加哥的玉蜀黍、大豆期货八日均跌至八分的极限（按美国交易所习惯，物价如涨跌至预先规定的极限时，当日即行评盘）。小麦燕麦亦告大跌。纽约棉花每包八日竟跌落六元之多，合众社说：这是上月物价大跌落以来最猛烈的一次跌价。九日开盘时，各种粮价仍然暴跌，每蒲式尔的小麦跌了六分七，玉蜀黍跌了七分五，燕麦跌了三分。与此同时，纽约的各种主要股票价格八日亦普遍下跌，九日仍在继续下跌中，且成交为数寥寥。
