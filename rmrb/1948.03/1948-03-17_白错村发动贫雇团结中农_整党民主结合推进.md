[Shahe News] The work team in Baicuo Village, Shahe Fourth District, arrived in the village on the 27th of last month. The work team first decided to change its old work style (because the village is the location of the district office), not eating and sleeping at the district level, but staying and eating at the poorest homes to be close to the poor peasants.

After a day and a half of visiting the poor and asking about their suffering, it was discovered that the village had already organized a poor peasant league around December last year, with a total of 63 people. It was still controlled by the old cadres, and everything had to go through them. Yang Qi was very poor, but not qualified to join the poor peasant league. Based on the above situation, the work team decided to stop the activities of this fake poor peasant league and reorganize the poor peasant小组 (xiǎozǔ, small groups), with five people specifically assigned tasks. One person was assigned to consolidate the Party; another was assigned to investigate the village's burden accounts to understand the village's situation of overturning, as a basis for preliminary class division; and the other three continued to go deep among the poor peasants. After four days of visiting the poor, a total of 29 people were organized. These 29 poor and lower-middle peasants were all honest people who had worked hard for many years and could not even say a word. When mobilizing the poor and lower-middle peasants, middle peasants also attended meetings, and cadres also attended meetings. Most of them sat at home and "brooded". In this situation, the work team convened a village-wide peasants' meeting on the 26th, explained the policies, and stated that the village's working principle was to take from the excess to compensate for the deficiency, and to take from the rich to supplement the poor, and never to disrupt equal distribution. It also explained that middle and poor peasants were one family and the policies towards middle peasants. After the meeting, many middle peasants seemed to have taken a soothing pill, and their panic was overcome. At this time, the poor peasant小组 (xiǎozǔ, small groups)  colluded with the middle peasants on one hand, and on the other hand, rectified the branch members to explain to the poor and lower-middle peasants that the Party members were reflecting, and let the poor and lower-middle peasants send representatives to participate and help them reflect. That night, the representatives returned to report to everyone on the branch's reflection and the opinions they had raised, and everyone's morale was very high.

After the branch studied the "Letter to Party Members," Party members with minor mistakes believed they had nothing to reflect on, while those with major mistakes feared the masses more than their superiors and did not recognize the power of the masses. They only mentioned the mistakes that others knew about, and their learning attitude was extremely insincere. The leadership emphasized that good Party members should admit and correct their mistakes, and that the Party and the people still needed them, otherwise they would have no future. The reflection attitude gradually became more sincere. After the peasant representatives participated in the branch meeting and raised their opinions, they realized the power of the masses. Under the pressure from both above and below, Party members with major mistakes did not eat or sleep. After three days of serious ideological struggle, most Party members awakened their class consciousness, recognized the root cause of their past problems, and were determined to re-align themselves in the future. At the middle and poor peasant大会 (dàhuì, congress/conference/meeting) on the evening of the 8th of this month, the list of Party members was announced for the masses to review. After the masses deliberated, Party members were divided into three categories: the first category had major problems with five people, the second category had six people, and the third category had minor problems with nine people. On the spot, the director of the farmers' association, Hao Choude, admitted his mistakes to everyone, saying: "I was a hired laborer for fourteen years. After the Eighth Route Army came, I became a militia member and joined the Communist Party. When the struggle began, I became the director of the farmers' association. When I had power, I took more fruits. Eight people occupied thirty-two rooms. I embezzled and cheaply bought a lot of fruits. I am a person who forgets a hundred hunger when I am full, I am a poor person who has left the position of the poor people." At that time, Wu Dashuang, an old hired laborer of thirty years, said: "Choude! We used to be a group of people. You worked as a hired laborer for others, and I worked with you as a partner. After you became a cadre, you forgot the poor people completely." Then fourteen people spoke. The conference lasted until two o'clock, and no one fell asleep. The conference continued on the 9th. Hu Xiaolai, the director of the cooperative, said: "I am a middle peasant. I am selfish and self-interested. I try my best to exploit women's spinning. To the district union, I give flowers on sunny days and pay cloth money on cloudy days; to women, I issue flowers on cloudy days and collect cloth money on sunny days; I collect high and pay low for women. My own women spin cloth and give first-class cloth. Whoever treats me right can hand in first- or second-class, if not, always hand in third-class." Then, Hao Yu'e, a poor peasant woman, said: "You are a Party member. Our Chairman Mao told you to speak the truth and handle affairs fairly. You only selfish and self-interested. If it weren't for today's Party consolidation, I wouldn't dare to say anything, even if it rotted in my stomach." Hu Zhangshi, Zhao En, and five other women also complained about the suffering in spinning, crying as they spoke. Of the 72 people who attended the meeting, more than 40 made comments. The atmosphere of the conference became higher and higher. After three days and nights of reviewing the Party members, the masses had clear eyes. Party members with minor mistakes were passed over with a single mention. Only after Party members with major mistakes were criticized three times were they finally passed. Now fifteen Party members have officially joined the new farmers' association. The remaining five Party members, who have made more serious mistakes, are still reflecting.

　　白错村发动贫雇团结中农
  　整党民主结合推进
    【沙河消息】沙河四区白错村工作组，于上月二十七日到该村，工作组首先确定改变过去的旧作风（因该村是区公所所在地），不在区上吃饭和睡觉，谁家穷到谁家住和吃饭，以便接近贫雇。
    经过一天半的访苦访贫，发现该村在去年十二月左右，已组织了贫农团，共六十三人，还是老干部操纵，有啥事都必须经过老干部，杨七的非常穷，却没资格参加贫农团。工作组同志根据以上情况，确定停止这个假贫农团的活动，重新组织贫农小组，五人具体分工，抽出一人专门进行整党；另外一人专查村中负担帐，了解该村翻身情况，以作为初步划阶级的基础；另外三人继续深入贫雇。经过四天访苦，共组织起二十九人。这二十九个贫雇，都是长年劳动，连句话都不会说的老实人。在发动贫雇时，中农见到负雇也开会，干部也开会，大部都坐在家里“发闷”。在这种情况下，工作组在二十六日召开了全村农民大会，解释了政策，说明了该村工作方针是抽多补少抽肥补瘦，决不打乱平分，又说明了中贫农是一家和对中农的政策。会后很多中农好象吃了顺气丸一样，恐慌情绪克服了。这时贫农小组一面串通中农，另一方面整顿支部的同志向贫雇说明党员正在反省，让贫雇派代表参加帮助他们反省。当晚代表回来向大家报告了支部反省情况和他们提意见情况，大家情绪很高。
    支部学习了告党员书后，错误小的认为自己没有啥，错误大的不怕群众怕上级，不认识群众力量，对错误只说别人知道的，学习态度极不老实。领导上强调提出好党员认错改错，党和人民还是要你们的，否则就没有前途，反省态度逐步老实起来。在农民派代表参加支部会向他们提出意见后，他们才认识了群众力量。在上下双方压力下，错误大的党员饭也不吃，觉也不睡，经过三天严重思想斗争后，大部党员唤起阶级自觉，认识了过去毛病根源，决心今后重新站队。在本月八日晚中贫农大会上，宣布党员名单让群众审查，群众酝酿结果，把党员分成三类：一类问题大的有五人，二类有六人，三类问题小的有九人。当场有农会主任郝丑的，向大家承认错误，他说：“我是十四年雇工，八路军过来后当了民兵，参加了共产党，斗争开始又当了农会主任，我有了权，我就多占果实，八口人就占房子卅二间，贪污贱买果实很多。我是一饱忘了百饥的人，我是穷人离开了穷人立场。”当时群众中有卅年的老雇工武大双说：“丑的！咱原先是一帮人，你给人家做雇工，我和你在一块格过伙计，你当了干部后，你就把穷人忘的一点也没了。”接着有十四个人都发了言，大会开到下两点，没有一人磕睡。九日大会继续开，合作社社长胡小来说：“我是中农，我自私自利，想尽办法剥削妇女们纺织。对到区联社，晴天领花阴天交布交钱；对妇女们是阴天发花，晴天收布收钱；对妇女们收秤高、出秤低，自己女人纺织布都是交头等布。对别人谁给我对劲可交头二等，如果不对眼老交三等。”当有贫雇妇女郝玉蛾说：“你是党员哩，咱毛主席叫你说真理办公道事，你们光自私自利，要不是今天整党，话烂在肚里也不敢说。”又有胡张氏、赵恩的等七个妇女，都诉了在纺织上的苦，一面说一面哭。共参加会的七十二人，有四十多人都提了意见。大会情绪越开越高。经过三天三夜审查党员，群众眼光明亮，错误小的党员，一提就放过去了，错误大的，经过三次提意见，最后才算通过。现在已有十五个党员，正式参加新农会。下余五个党员，错误较大，还在继续反省中。（高孟，李＠、有义、尚福）
