Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: The Shandong Party and government authorities are vigorously leading the work of production and disaster relief. In the past three months, they have taken many important measures and achieved initial results. Since the East China Bureau of the CPC issued the call for production and preparedness against famine last December, and the provincial government promulgated eight prohibitions and ten requirements, all organs and troops have first implemented measures to clear assets, report corruption, and lower living standards to reduce the burden on the people. The East China Financial and Economic Office issued loans of 200 million yuan and 500,000 jin of food in central Shandong last winter. Subsequently, it issued agricultural loans of 130,000 million yuan in central Shandong, southern Shandong, Binhai, and Binbei, 30 million jin of grain in Bohai, and 25 million jin of grain in Jiaodong. It also allocated more than 4 million jin of relief grain to the Xihai and Nanhai districts of Jiaodong. This spring, the disaster situation in central Shandong was serious, and the Financial and Economic Office immediately transported 1 million jin of soybeans for relief, while southern Shandong, Binhai, and Binbei each allocated 100,000 to 200,000 jin of soybeans for relief, and organized various places to manufacture agricultural tools and purchase plows and agricultural tools to lend to farmers. The Lunan Administrative Office has purchased 1,500 jin of vegetable seeds and made 15,000 shovel heads to help farmers. In total, the province has issued agricultural loans of 150,000 million yuan (each yuan is approximately equivalent to 50 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency), loaned 55.5 million jin of grain, and provided more than 4 million jin of relief grain and 1.5 million jin of relief soybeans. The amount is unprecedented in previous years. The provincial government also issued an order in February to ban brewing and sold a large amount of stored grain on the market in March to stabilize grain prices. It also mobilized the masses in central Shandong, southern Shandong, Binhai, and Binbei to transport 2 million jin of cotton from Bohai, with each small cart earning a net profit of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Grain was also transferred from areas with surplus grain to areas with grain shortages, with transporters receiving a commission of 12% to 15%. The Highway Bureau adopted a work-for-relief method to build highways, with each person receiving 2 jin of wage grain per day. This not only solved the living difficulties of disaster victims but also developed construction undertakings. In terms of epidemic prevention, the provincial government's medical team and others cured more than 20,000 patients in central Shandong and other places last year. The team is now moving to southern Shandong to work.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: Armymen and civilians in Central China are universally carrying out a save-to-relieve-disaster campaign to rescue disaster-stricken people in the Huaihai sub-region. The Suzhong and Yanfu sub-regions alone have raised 48 million yuan in Central China currency, more than 2 million jin of grain, and a large amount of clothing and property, which have been distributed to disaster victims. Among them, the workers of various rear factories of the Central China Production Management Office donated a total of 4.5 million yuan. A certain unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army, in addition to saving one liang of grain per person per day, also launched a campaign to donate 300 yuan per person. More than 100 merchants in the Donggao area of the Yanfu region donated a total of 1.6 million yuan. Farmers in the Juzhen and Xifang townships of Rudong County donated a total of 5,400 jin of grain, 120 jin of cotton, and more than 100,000 yuan. Liberated farmers in Wuwei Township and other places in Sixian County also donated 2,000 jin of fruit and grain.

    【新华社华东二十四日电】山东党政当局大力领导生产救灾工作，近三月来，已作多项重要措施，并收到初步成效。自去年十二月中共华东局发出生产备荒号召，省政府颁布八项禁令，十项要求后，首先在一切机关部队实行清理资财，检举贪污，降低生活标准，以减轻人民负担。华东财经办事处则于去年冬在鲁中发放两万万元贷款、五十万斤贷粮，接着又于鲁中、鲁南、滨海、滨北共发放农贷十三万万元、渤海三千万斤粮、胶东二千五百万斤粮，并拨给胶东西海、南海两区救济粮四百多万斤。今春鲁中灾情严重，财办处即急运一百万斤豆子进行救济，鲁南、滨海、滨北各拨一、二十万斤豆子救济，并组织各地制造农具，购买耕牛农具贷与农民。鲁中行署已购得菜种一千五百斤、制成铲头一万五千具，帮助农民。总计全省已发放农业贷款十五万万元（每元约合蒋币五十元左右），贷粮五千五百五十万斤，救济粮四百多万斤，救济豆子一百五十万斤。为数之巨，为历年所未有。省府并于二月下令禁止酿酒，三月份向市场平粜抛出大批存粮，平抑了粮价。又发动鲁中、鲁南、滨海、滨北等区群众自渤海运输二百万斤棉花，每辆小车可净赚二、三十万元。再自粮多地区调剂粮食至缺粮地区，规定运粮者提成百分之十二至十五。公路局采取以工代赈办法修筑公路，每人一天可得工资粮二斤。既解决了灾民的生活困难，又发展了建设事业。防疫方面，去年省府医疗大队等在鲁中等地治愈病人二万余名。现该队又转赴鲁南工作。
    【新华社华东二十四日电】华中军民普遍开展节约救灾运动，抢救淮海分区灾胞。仅苏中、盐阜两分区，即已募得华中币（下同）四千八百万元，粮食二百多万斤和大量衣服财物等，分发灾胞。其中华中生产管理处各后方工厂工友共捐献四百五十万元。华中解放军某部，除每人每天节约粮食一两外，并发起每人捐献三百元运动，盐阜区东高地区百多商人共捐一百六十万元，如（皋）东县苴镇与西方乡农民共捐粮五千四百斤、棉花一百二十斤和十万多元。泗沭县吴圩乡等地翻身农民亦即捐出果实粮二千斤。
