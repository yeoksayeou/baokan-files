　　Oppose Bad Work Styles

　　Land reform work is very detailed mass work. All issues and actions related to land reform must be fully deliberated and matured, with the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, uniting the middle peasants, and obtaining the consent of the vast majority before implementation. Otherwise, problems will arise. The patrol committee of Beixingtou Village in Huguan County made the mistake of confiscating the property of well-to-do middle peasants (see this paper's edition of the 28th of last month). Similarly, Qingcaoao Village in Pingshun County organized a supervisory patrol group. Although the intention is to protect the Land Law, judging from the facts of Beixingtou Village in Huguan County, this type of organization can easily lead to a few people acting blindly, thereby causing people to misunderstand the Land Law, creating tension and unease in the countryside, and affecting production. Preventing sabotage of the Land Law is necessary, but the best way to prevent it is to correctly publicize the Land Law so that everyone knows what the Land Law is and how it should be implemented in their village. As long as everyone can correctly understand the Land Law and is concerned about its implementation, even if some individuals intend to sabotage it, they can easily be discovered and stopped. Therefore, we believe that patrol groups organized by a few people, even if they include both male and female poor and hired peasants, will still lead to bad results.

　　The actions of the political director of Huangya should be strictly prohibited. As the editor of the bulletin said, he did this to cover up his own excessive appropriation of fruits, which is compounding the error. However, the leadership should also review whether there have been any incorrect instructions that allowed self-serving elements to take advantage of them. It should be deeply recognized that the action of the political director of Huangya leading people to register property door-to-door is a very bad work style, a serious style of ruling the masses. The leadership should not only strictly correct this behavior, but also quickly eliminate this bad work style that still exists among many cadres.

　　反对坏作风
    土地改革工作，是很细致的群众工作，对于有关土改的问题和行动，都要酝酿成熟，以贫雇为骨干联合中农，得到绝大多数人的同意后才能办。不然就会出毛病。壶关北行头村巡查委员会曾犯没收富裕中农财产的错误（见上月二十八日本版），而平顺青草凹也组织了一个监视巡查小组，意思虽是保护土地法，但从壶关北行头的事实看来，这一类的组织，极容易形成少数人盲干，由此引起人们对土地法的误解，造成农村紧张不安，影响生产。防止破坏土地法是应该的，但防止的最好办法，是正确宣传土地法，使人人晓得土地法是什么，晓得在本村应该怎样实行土地法。只要大家都能正确了解土地法，都关心土地法的实行，即使有个别人存心破坏，也容易被人发现、阻止。因此，我们认为，少数人所组织的巡查小组，即使是男女贫雇都参加也是一样，都会造成不好的结果。
    象黄崖政治主任的行动更应严予制止，正如通报编稿人所说，他为了掩盖自己多占果实而这样做，是错上加错。但领导上亦应检讨，是否曾有过什么不很正确的指示，致被假公济私的分子钻了空子？应该深刻认识：黄崖政治主任带领人马挨门登记财产，这是一种极坏的作风，是严重的统治群众的作风，领导上不但应严格纠正这一行为，而且应迅速扫除至今仍存于不少干部中间的这种坏作风。
