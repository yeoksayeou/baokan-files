　　Impatient in Mobilizing the Masses
　　Simply Carrying Out Reorganization
　　New Farmers' Association Group Leaders in Zhonggao Village Poorly Elected
　　[Shahe News] In the process of reorganizing the ranks in Zhonggao Village, there was insufficient effort to enlighten and raise the consciousness of the masses. The masses had not yet recognized the significance of the reorganization, most had not become conscious, and were still afraid of trouble and unwilling to take the lead. Elections for new Farmers' Association group leaders were then conducted. Consequently, among those elected, five out of ten were not very sound (such as one who had served as a puppet Ba trưởng in the past, and one child under the age of sixteen). This is the result of not patiently mobilizing the masses.
　　Lu Yujing, in his forties, has a family of five and ten mu of land, mostly poor quality. He is a hardworking and honest middle peasant. In addition to farming, he makes tofu as a sideline because he cannot make ends meet. During the mass movement, he refused the fruits distributed to him; when his son took them home, he complained. Now, when asked to join the new Farmers' Association, he refuses, saying, "What would I do by joining the Farmers' Association? They tell me to do errands, and I do errands. They tell me to attend meetings, and I attend meetings. Why should I join the Farmers' Association?"
　　Wang Shunjing of Xia Zheng Village is an honest and upright poor peasant. He suffered blows from the old cadres. When others told him to bring up the blows he received to the cadres, he refused, saying, "Let the past be. What's the point of bringing it up?" From these two examples, we can see that the honest peasants who have not been mobilized are afraid of trouble and involvement, and are also the most difficult to mobilize. Mobilizing this part of the population is a work that requires patience. (Du Jin, Zheng Bingcai)

　　不耐心发动群众
  　只简单进行整编
  　中高村新农会组长选的不好
    【沙河消息】中高村在整编队伍当中，启发提高群众觉悟不够，群众还没认识到整编意义，多没觉悟起来，还怕麻烦，不愿当家做主，就进行选举新农会组长，所以选的组长，十个就有五个不很健全（如过去当过伪保长的一个、不够十六岁的儿童一个），这是不耐心发动群众的结果。
    路玉京四十余岁，人五口，好坏地十来亩，坏地多，他是个好劳动又很老实中农，他除种地外，因生活维持不住，附带卖豆腐，在大运动中分给他果实他不要，他儿子拿到家他还埋怨，现在叫他参加新农会，他不参加，他说：“我参加农会干什么，他们叫我支差我支差，叫我开会我开会，我何必参加农会。”
    下郑村王顺京，是个老实正派的贫农，他受过旧干部打击，别人说你受的打击给干部提出来吧！他不提，他说：“过去的事情算了吧，提他干什么。”从这两个材料中，我们研究没发动起的老实农民，他是怕麻烦、怕事，同时也最难发动，发动这部分人，是个耐心的工作。（杜进、郑炳才）
