How to Gain the Trust of Poor and Hired Peasants?
　　Requesting Supplementary Report from Comrades Working in Tian Erzhuang

To the Editor:
　　After reading the front-page headline “Cadres in Tian Erzhuang Shelter Landlords” in the February 13th People’s Daily, we believe that this material has certain value and educational significance. Because southern Hebei is currently organizing work teams to go to the countryside to carry out land reform, the first problem to be solved after going to the village is how to visit the poor and hired peasants. This material introduces the experience of visiting the poor and hired peasants, which undoubtedly provides great enlightenment for comrades going to the village. At the same time, this material runs through a mass viewpoint—the issue of trusting the masses—and clearly points out that the relationship between the poor and hired peasants and us is a process of mutual understanding, mutual investigation, and gradual trust over half a month. The title also emphasizes “Standing Firm in Action to Gain the Trust of Poor and Hired Peasants,” which also inspires us that when working in the village, we should not simply try to find out the bottom line of the poor and hired peasants, but rather allow the poor and hired peasants to find out our bottom line. Only when the poor and hired peasants have a clear understanding of our bottom line is it possible for us to find out the bottom line of the poor and hired peasants. As for the meticulous and in-depth work in the village, the timely inspection and summarization style, and the connection to ideological activities and reflection in the report, all are worthy of our learning.

　　However, we also feel that there are still shortcomings. For example, the news says that after the poor and hired peasants understood our bottom line, they gradually told us their innermost thoughts. Recently, many people who have suffered great injustice have personally come to tell us things they would never tell anyone else. We believe that this is the process of ideological change for the poor and hired peasants, and also the most successful aspect of visiting the poor and hired peasants, but the author wrote it too simply. Also, regarding the discovery of core figures, how were they discovered? What specific facts were used to illustrate that they possessed the four major conditions? In particular, how were they "selfless" and "enthusiastic about serving everyone"? What actions did they take to demonstrate this? All of this was not written in enough detail. Some issues were not raised in the narration process, but were raised in the overall review, making it difficult to understand the clues. The overall impression is that there are too few specific facts, too little mass activity, and the crucial points are not written in enough detail.

　　In addition, under the subheading "Sincerely Accept the Criticism of the People," we believe that the author's review in the first point is still insufficient. The issue of uniting with the middle peasants has been clearly stipulated in the Land Law Outline and Chairman Mao's December 25th report. If the comrades working in the village did not pay attention to grasping this point after going to the village, and after the poor and hired peasants criticized and educated them, they more deeply realized the correctness and importance of this issue, then this should be explained. However, the way the author reviewed it makes it seem as if the author did not know the importance of uniting with the middle peasants beforehand. Also, in the third point, saying that they "fell for Yang Sheng's tricks," this kind of review is not a subjective review: being incautious, easily trusting someone. In the fifth point, saying that they "tested" the poor and hired peasants, we believe that this is a statement from a leadership position, which contradicts the previous "Sincerely Accept the Criticism of the People."

　　Also, when fighting against Yang Sheng, what attitude did the poor and hired peasants have? It is not clear from the news. The term "Don Quixote-like" is not very common.

　　The above opinions are only our views. Please advise whether they are correct or not. At the same time, we hope that the comrades working in the village will continue to report; and supplement the report on "How the Poor and Hired Peasants Reached the Point of Telling Us Things They Would Never Tell Anyone Else" and the experience of discovering core figures. With best regards!

### 怎样得到贫雇信任？　要求田二庄工作同志补充报导

　　怎样得到贫雇信任？
  　要求田二庄工作同志补充报导编辑同志：
    我们读了二月十三日人民日报一版头条“田二庄干部包庇地主”后，认为这篇材料有其一定的价值及教育意义，因为冀南正组织工作团下乡搞土改，下村之后第一个要解决的问题就是如何访贫雇，这篇材料介绍了访贫雇的经验，无疑的对下村同志是有很大启示的；同时这篇材料贯串着一个群众观念——相信群众的问题，并明确提出半月中贫雇与我们的关系是互相摸底，互相调查，逐渐相信的过程，标题又强调“行动站稳立场，取得贫雇信任”，这也启示了我们下村工作不要单纯去摸贫雇的底，而要贫雇来摸我们的底，只有贫雇摸清了我们的底，我们摸贫雇的底才有可能。至于该村工作中的细密深入，及时检查、总结的作风，以及报导中联系到思想活动及反省，都是值得我们学习的。
    但我们也感觉还有美中不足的地方，比如消息中说，贫雇摸清了我们的底后，逐渐将心底话告诉我们，近来更有许多受过奇冤大苦的人亲自找来，告诉我们永不告人的话，我们认为这是贫雇思想的变化过程，也是访贫雇最成功的地方，但作者写得太简单；还有在发现核心人物上，如何发现的？都是根据了哪些具体事实来说明他们已具备了四大条件？特别是说明他们“大公无私”“热心为大家办事”，都表现在哪些行动上，也写得不够详细；在前边有些问题在叙述过程中未提出，可是在总的检讨中又提出，叫人摸不清头绪；总的印象是写的具体事实少，群众的活动少，紧要关节处写得不详细。
    另外在“诚恳接受人民的批评”小标题下，第一点作者的检讨，我们认为还有不足的地方，就是说团结中农问题，在土地法大纲及毛主席十二月廿五号报告里已明白规定过。如该村工作同志下村后未注意掌握这点，经贫雇提出批评与教育后，更深刻体会这问题的正确及重要，那就应该说明，可是作者那么检讨，我们看去，好象作者事前不知道团结中农的重要似的。又在第三点说“上了杨生的当”，这样检讨不是从主观上来检讨：不谨慎，轻信一个人；在第五点说“考验”了贫雇，我们认为这是站在领导地位的说法，与前边“诚恳接受人民的批评”相矛盾。
    还有斗争杨生的时候，到底贫雇抱什么态度，从消息上看不明白；“唐吉诃德式的”一名词，我们认为不大通俗。
    以上这些意见仅是我们的见解，对不对，还请指示。同时还希望该村工作同志继续报导；并补充报导“贫雇如何达到把永不告人的话告诉我们”及发现核心人物的经验。即致敬礼！
