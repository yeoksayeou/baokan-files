　　【This newspaper's dispatch】A report from the Yetao Work Team: After the masses participated in the Party branch rectification meetings, they immediately proceeded with the initial classification of class status for the entire village. In the process of aligning teams, they implemented mass self-education, grasped the new spirit of class classification (based on the ownership of means of production and production relations), and corrected past errors such as comparing living standards and investigating three generations back. Because grasping mass ideological education and the standards of class classification is a crucial key to whether the alignment of teams can be successful. Before the team alignment, the work team first conducted a preliminary study of the class classification documents, clarifying in concept that class classification is a struggle. Then, they conducted class education within the four street poor and hired peasant groups. The next day, they convened all the masses from each street to align teams (those who were being struggled against did not participate), and explained the standards of class classification in detail to everyone. After the explanation, they allowed the masses to deliberate for a while and voluntarily come out to align teams, with the new middle peasants standing together, the old middle peasants standing together, and the poor and hired peasants standing together. Then, they offered opinions to each other, considering whether anyone's alignment was appropriate. During the team alignment, a complex and intense struggle unfolded, with new middle peasants wanting to be poor and hired peasants, and old middle peasants wanting to be new middle peasants. In one street, more than 30 people originally stood as poor and hired peasants, but the new and old middle peasants were indignant and dissatisfied, pointing out that so-and-so did not have the qualifications of a poor and hired peasant, picking and choosing from among the poor and hired peasants until only a dozen or so people were left. In the second street, when aligning teams, the new and old middle peasants stood on both sides, and the poor peasants stood in the middle. The result of the alignment formed a shape like a cotton flail, with the new and old middle peasants being very large at both ends, and the poor and hired peasants being extremely few in the middle. No one dared to stand in the position of a poor and hired peasant. Only one poor blind person stood alone in the middle. Later, they selected outwards from the new middle peasants, and as a result, only a dozen widowed women and old men were said to be poor and hired peasants, while those who were strong in labor and poor were unable to stand in the position of poor and hired peasants. In the third and fourth streets, a tug-of-war situation formed, with some jumping from old middle peasant to new middle peasant, and then jumping from new middle peasant to old middle peasant, and others jumping from poor and hired peasant to old middle peasant. For example, Huang Qishan from the second street should have stood as a new middle peasant. Twenty-nine years ago, he had a family of three, with five and a half mu of land, which was not enough to sustain their livelihood, and one person worked as a long-term laborer outside. However, the general old middle peasants said that his working as a long-term laborer was surplus labor, seizing on this point and forcibly pulling him into the old middle peasant category. Some old middle peasants also said that they were afraid that there would be too few old middle peasants, and they would be weak and isolated. There was also a type of poor peasant who had lazy habits, was not frugal, and liked to drink alcohol. The masses did not agree with him being classified as a poor peasant. They said that the poor peasant association was a group that led everyone, and it would be terrible if he became a poor peasant. Similar situations occurred in other streets. After discovering this phenomenon, we immediately studied the ideological state of the masses. The basic reasons for their disputes were: one was based on their own economic interests, and the other was based on political rights. The masses felt that if they could stand as poor and hired peasants, they could get a larger share of the fruits. Standing as a new middle peasant meant that they would neither contribute nor receive. If they stood as an old middle peasant, they were afraid that their land and property would be taken away. In terms of political rights, they believed that standing as a poor and hired peasant was equivalent to joining the poor peasant association, and the poor peasant association was infinitely glorious. For example, a family member of a military serviceman felt ashamed and had nowhere to hide because he had not joined the poor peasant group, saying that he was letting down his son who was serving in the military. When the masses argued, they easily put the standards of class classification out of their minds and quickly resorted to comparing living standards and comparing history. Old middle peasants were unwilling for others to stand as new middle peasants, and tried their best to expose the shortcomings of others' behavior, or compared the good and bad of their lives. An old middle peasant said: "Middle peasants are not all the same, they should be divided into twelve levels to be fair." He regarded the strength of labor, political conditions, and general corruption problems as the standards for class classification. Generally, new middle peasants were unwilling for others to be classified as poor and hired peasants. They did not look at whether people were able to live a middle peasant life, even if they did not have livestock or farm tools, they only looked at the yield of the land. If the yield was enough, but they had not lived a middle peasant life for a full year, they would also raise him to the level of a new middle peasant. In response to the situation, the comrades of the work team repeatedly explained the standards of class classification to the masses, criticizing incorrect standards such as comparing living standards and comparing history. At the same time, they explained: "Filling the gaps does not necessarily have to be done according to class status, but according to the specific circumstances of each family. The needs of middle peasants must also be taken care of." New middle peasants can also participate in the poor peasant association. The disputes gradually shifted from tense to moderate. However, some old middle peasants were still not in high spirits, always feeling that they were not secure and had no political status. Some new middle peasants were also dissatisfied with the status of poor and hired peasants, and ridiculed and satirized the poor and hired peasants, forming an incongruous phenomenon between old middle peasants and new middle peasants, and between new middle peasants and poor and hired peasants. At this time, the work team conducted a work review: believing that the alignment of teams itself was to clarify class status and distinguish between friend and foe. The incongruity between middle and poor peasants for a time was unavoidable, and we cannot hinder the clarification of class status for fear of incongruity. In order to overcome this incongruous phenomenon, we have repeatedly explained that one alignment may not necessarily be very appropriate, and there will be more alignments in the future. In addition, we should also carry out education on middle and poor peasants running the household together, and publicize the political rights of middle and poor peasants, in order to reduce the degree of incongruity. However, we previously only publicized "poor and hired peasants running the household," and did not vigorously publicize the role of the peasant representative assembly and Chairman Mao's five policies for middle peasants, which increased the unease of new and old middle peasants. This is a very important shortcoming.

　　After the men finished aligning their teams, the women aligned their teams separately. On the first day, when the men aligned their teams, many women automatically participated in observing and learning. The next day, they came to align their teams separately. We anticipated in advance that there would be fewer women participating in general, especially older women, who have a poorer ability to receive, and cannot accept the standards of class classification all at once. If they aligned teams with the men, the women would not dare to speak and would feel restrained. Therefore, each street convened women separately to align teams, and repeatedly explained to them until most of them understood before they aligned. Generally, the class status they aligned to was the same as the men's class status. There were also many women who were dissatisfied with the class status that their men had aligned to, and came out to reason, asking for a reclassification. Zhang Maoshi's wife from the second street felt that her husband had made a mistake in standing as an old middle peasant on the first day. She said that after their family of three separated in 1942, they were allocated four and a half mu of land, and the grain they harvested was not enough to eat, and they lived a poor peasant life for more than a year. After everyone's discussion, he was allowed to stand as a new middle peasant again. Li Zhenhua and Yang Guorui's wives from the first street stood in the new middle peasant category, but many women disagreed, saying that the first mothers-in-law of both of them were objects of struggle, and they had lived a landlord life for many years before remarrying for less than a year, and could not change their class status. Huang Mei from the fourth street, was a servant in a landlord's house when she was a child, and married a poor peasant for more than ten years. Other women did not agree with her being classified as a poor peasant with her husband, saying that she had enjoyed the life of a landlord in the past and wore foreign cloth clothes all day long. Some women said that foreign cloth was foreign cloth, but they were all leftovers from the landlord, and people did not treat her as a person, so this does not count as having lived a landlord life. After a heated debate, they agreed to her standing as a poor peasant. From this, we felt that women aligning teams separately, patiently and repeatedly educating them, had a greater effect on mobilizing women and raising women's class consciousness than aligning teams with men. After the teams were aligned, the poor and hired peasant groups in each street connected the poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants in batches, and established the poor peasant association.

　　纠正比生活查三代的错误
  　冶陶群众初划阶级
    【本报消息】冶陶工作组报导：群众参加支部整党会议后，紧接着即进行全村群众初划阶级。在站队的过程中，贯彻群众自我教育，掌握划阶级的新精神（以生产手段的占有及生产关系为标准），纠正过去比生活、查三代等的错误标准。因为掌握群众思想教育与划阶级标准，是站队能否站好的重要关键。站队以前，工作组首先将划阶级文件初步研究，在观念上，明确了划阶级是个斗争。接着即在四个街贫雇小组内进行阶级教育，第二天召集各街全体群众站队（被斗户没参加），再详细向大家讲划阶级的标准，讲完之后，让群众酝酿一会，自动出来站队，新中农站在一块，老中农站在一块，贫雇站在一块。然后互相提意见，考虑谁站的是否恰当。站队时候，展开了错综复杂的激烈斗争，新中农想当贫雇，老中农想当新中农。一街贫雇农原来站的有三十多人，新老中农愤愤不满，提出某某人不够贫雇成份，从贫雇农当中往外挑剔，挑剔到最后只剩下十几个人。二街站队时，新老中农站两边，贫农站中间。站的结果，形成了弹花锤样子，新老中农两头很大，中间贫雇农极少，谁也不敢站在贫雇农的位置，只有一个贫穷的瞎子孤零零的站在中间，后来又从新中农里头向外挑选，结果只有十几个孤寡老婆和老汉都说是贫雇农，劳力强，而贫穷的不能站在贫雇地位。三、四街形成拉锯状态，有的从老中农跳到新中农，一会又从新中农跳到老中农，也有从贫雇跳到老中农的。如二街黄秋山本应站新中农，二十九年前，三口人，五亩半地，顾不住生活，一人在外边当长工。但一般老中农说他当长工是剩余劳力，抓住这点，硬往老中农里拉，也有老中农说，恐怕老中农少了，势单力孤。也有一种贫农，有懒惰习气，不俭省，好喝酒。群众不同意他站成贫农成份。说贫农团是领导大家的团体，他当了贫农成份就糟了，其他各街都有类似情况。发现这种现象后，我们即研究群众思想状况，他们争执的基本原因：一是从本身经济利益出发，一是从政治权利出发。群众感到，如果自己能够站到贫雇，分果实即可多分。站到新中农，即可不进不出。如果站到老中农，恐怕还抽自己土地和财产。在政治权利上，他们认为站到贫雇即等于参加了贫农团，贫农团是无尚光荣。如一抗属因为没有参加上贫雇小组，整天感到羞愧无地，说他对不起参军的儿子。群众争执时，就容易把划阶级的标准置诸脑后，很快扯到比生活、比历史上。老中农不愿别人站在新中农，极力揭发人家行为上的短处，或者比生活好坏。一老中农说：中农和中农都不一样，要划成十二等成份才公道。他把劳力强弱，政治条件，一般腐化毛病，都当作了划阶级的标准。一般新中农不愿别人划成贫雇，他们不看人家是否能够上中农生活，那怕牲口、农具等都没有，单看人家的土地产量，如果产量补够了，但是过中农的生活还不够一年时间，也要把他提高到新中农。针对情况，工作组同志随时向群众反复讲明划阶级标准，批评那些比生活比历史等不正确的标准。同时说明：填补不一定单按成份，要按各家具体情况，中农的某些需要也一定要照顾。新中农也可参加贫农团，争执逐渐由紧张转趋和缓。但仍有一部分老中农情绪不高，总感到自己不保险，也无政治地位，有的新中农对贫雇农成份的也不满意，见了贫雇农冷嘲热讽，形成老中农与新中农，新中农与贫雇间的不融洽现象。此时，工作组进行了工作检讨：认为站队本身，就是划清阶级，分清敌我，一时中贫农间的不融洽是难免的，不能因为怕不融洽，而妨碍划清阶级。为了克服这种不融洽的现象，我们曾反复说明一次划的不一定就很妥当，以后还要划。此外，还应该进行中贫农一齐当家的教育，宣传中农贫农的政治权利，以减轻不融洽的程度。可是我们以前只宣传了“贫雇当家”，没有大力宣传农代会的作用和毛主席对中农的五项政策，增加了新老中农的不安，这是个很重要的缺点。
    男人站完队伍后，妇女单独站队。头一天，男人站队时，不少妇女自动参加旁观学习，第二天自己单独来站。我们预先考虑到，妇女一般的参加会少，尤其是老年妇女，接收能力更差，划阶级的标准，一下子接受不了。如和男人一块站队，妇女不敢发言，感到拘束。于是各街都单独召集妇女站队，再给她们反复讲解，她们大部分都懂得了以后才站，自己不知道是啥成份的另站在一堆，再进行讲解。一般站的成份，都和男人成份一样。也有很多妇女不满意自己男人站的成份，自己出来讲道理，要求重划。二街张毛时老婆，她男人头一天站成老中农，她感到站错了，她说她四二年分家后，三口人分了四亩半地，打得粮食不够吃，过过一年多贫农生活，后经大家讨论，又让他站成新中农。一街李振华、杨国瑞老婆，站到新中农里头，很多妇女不同意，说她俩第一个婆家都是斗争对象，过过许多年地主生活，才改嫁不到一年，不能变成份。四街黄梅的，小时在地主家当丫头，嫁的男人是贫农，已经十几年了，别的妇女不同意跟男人划成贫农，说她过去享受过地主生活，整天穿洋布衣裳。有的妇女说，洋布是洋布，但都是地主穿剩下的，人家没有把她看成人，这不算过过地主生活。经过热烈争论后，才同意她站成贫农。由此感到，妇女单独站队，耐心反复教育，对于发动妇女，提高妇女阶级觉悟，比和男人一块站队收效较大。站完队后，各街贫雇小组即分批串连贫雇及新中农，成立了贫农团。
