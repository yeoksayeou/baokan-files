　　Poor Peasants Actively Promote Middle Peasants
  　Spring Ploughing Begins in Hédōng Village

    [Report from this newspaper] With the start of spring ploughing, members of the poor peasant league in Wǔ'ān's Hédōng Village are proactively reaching out to middle peasants to resolve their concerns and understand their thoughts, using concrete actions to stabilize their emotions and dispel their worries. The entire village is now engaged in mutual aid, urgently digging irrigation channels and delivering manure. After the Land Law was implemented, middle peasants' emotions remained unsettled. While they didn't voice their concerns, they harbored various thoughts. Their main fear was that they would be targeted, feeling that Hédōng Village was poor with many "deficit households," and questioning how to make up the difference without touching the middle peasants. Some were anxious, saying to take the land quickly so they could produce, while others took matters into their own hands. Mèng Cónglán said, "I've 'understood' the situation. I'll just do a sloppy job of cultivating the land and go out to gather firewood first, then come back and work it carefully later." Mèng Fánjí said, "Keep a little good land and a little bad land, and the rest can be taken." Some were willing to give up land but not manure, saying manure was expensive and couldn't be bought with money, preferring to deliver it a few days later. Others expressed dissatisfaction. Mèng Fányì said, "I've been a hired hand my whole life, just barely making it by gathering firewood. Being squeezed like this leaves me half-dead. I'd rather just give it up." Some also had objections to the class designation. In this situation, coupled with the village's livestock problems, with over half the livestock sick and one-tenth dead, production was significantly affected. At the same time, during the establishment of the poor peasant league, the work team somewhat relaxed its work with the middle peasants, who felt they had lost their political rights and became anxious when they saw the poor and hired peasants holding meetings. After the poor peasant league was established, the work team devoted all its efforts to solving the middle peasant issue in terms of thought, action, and organization. First, they mobilized at the poor peasant league meeting, making it their own idea to consolidate and unite with the middle peasants, dispelling their notion of targeting them. They asked everyone to consider: if we target the middle peasants to fill the deficit, but the middle peasants also become deficit households, who will we use to fill that? What if we create a bunch of small deficits to fill a big deficit? They explained that Hédōng was a poor village, a "deficit village" compared to other villages, and they could request the government to fill the gap from richer villages. If nearby villages didn't have surplus land, they could request other solutions, such as production loans or immigration. At the same time, they mobilized everyone to promote middle peasant production through action. Lǐ Xiǎolín, a poor peasant, had bad land and wasn't willing to move or dig irrigation channels, wanting to wait until the land was exchanged. Several poor peasants went to persuade him, telling him that it was difficult to adjust within the village and that it wouldn't be a matter of one or two days to find a solution from elsewhere. Mèng Chángfù also told him, "Even if you can exchange it, everyone else has already dug irrigation channels, and you haven't done anything. Who will exchange with you?" After mobilizing him, they proactively sought out the middle peasants to form mutual aid groups, with the poor peasants agreeing to take the lead. On the other hand, they prepared to establish a new farmers' association, explaining the farmers' association's powers and clarifying the middle peasants' political status, emphasizing that they and the poor peasants were one family. This was to make the middle peasants understand that establishing the poor peasant league first and then the farmers' association was a step-by-step process, first helping the poor brothers, just like building a house starts with the foundation, and it wasn't about abandoning the middle peasants.
    At the same time, the work team comrades went deep among the middle peasants, holding middle peasant forums, and later convened a village-wide meeting to resolve concerns. Most of the middle peasants' concerns were resolved, and production enthusiasm was generally improved. Mutual aid groups in all six lanes of the village have been organized, urgently delivering manure and digging irrigation channels. Everyone felt that there was a shortage of farm tools, making it difficult to borrow from this family and that family when working, and there was no money to add furniture. Even those with money had to wait for the Yě Táo Fair on the second day of the second lunar month. First, the furniture bought was not guaranteed to be good, second, waiting would delay production, and third, the money would be earned by others. "There's a blacksmith in our street, and there's also a lot of old furniture. If the furnace is set up, it can be used strongly and will be more convenient and suitable than buying new ones." The poor peasant league, the old village chief, the director of the farmers' association, and the political director planned together and took joint responsibility. The farmers' association borrowed some money, bought some scrap iron in the village, repaired the broken farm tools of the deficit households, and also made some new ones, which were counted as farmers' association property, registered for temporary borrowing, and then calculated and distributed during the filling of the deficit. After discussions in each group, the village needed to repair and build fifty or sixty pieces. The next day, the sparks from the blacksmith's furnace of the Mèng Fándé brothers flew up. "Our Hédōng Street's furnace is set up!" Mèng Fándé said, "Our furnace hasn't been set up for two or three years. If the poor peasant league hadn't been established, it wouldn't have been set up until February."
    In previous years, blacksmiths were reluctant to use steel, but this year they were adding large pieces of steel. One blacksmith was a Communist Party member. After party rectification, he learned how to serve the masses and wanted to repair the poor brothers' hoes to be particularly durable.
    During the day, the village streets were quiet, and the farmers were all in the fields. Only the blacksmiths' clanging and the bellows' movement could be heard. When the sun set, the two blacksmiths' shiny faces still flickered in the firelight, concentrating on wielding their hammers. They made seven pieces a day, and all the furniture in the village could be finished before the second day of the second lunar month.
    Sixty-seven-year-old Grandma Fúlái used cloth bags to load manure and carried them on her shoulders to the fields. After studying the Three Checks, the comrades of the stationed agency all requested to take the time to serve the masses in the village. In addition to most of them having participated in the land reform work, they also organized the remaining manpower and livestock to help deliver manure, dig irrigation channels, and carry out spring ploughing. As of March 5th, they had delivered 59 pack animal loads, eight carts, and twenty-six loads of manure for the poor and hired peasants. The more than ten mu of school public land in the village that was being prepared for filling the deficit was also being helped by the agency comrades, ensuring that no land was left uncultivated.

　　贫农主动推动中农
  　河东全村开始春耕
    【本报消息】春耕开始，武安河东村贫农团团员主动深入中农解疙瘩摸心思，以具体行动稳定中农情绪，解除中农顾虑。现在全村已互助起来，突击刨堰送粪，土地法下来后，中农情绪一直不安，嘴里不说啥，心里各有各的心思。主要是怕动到自己头上，觉得河东村子穷，窟窿户多，不动中农拿啥来补？于是有的着急，说要抽就快抽，抽完好生产，有的自打主意，孟从兰说：我思想“通”了，把地马马虎虎弄了，先出去拾砍，回来再细作；孟凡吉则说：好地留一点，坏地留一点，其余的可以收拾。有的舍地不舍粪，说粪贵，有钱也买不到，宁可晚送几天；有的则表现不满，孟凡义就说：一辈子当长工，拾砍这么个时光，抽得我不死不活，我索兴不要了。也有人对划阶级有意见。在这种情形下，再加上村里牲口出毛病，全村牲口病了一半多，死了十分之一，相当影响生产。同时在贫农团成立期间，工作组对中农工作有点放松，他们便觉得自己没有了政治权利，看见贫雇农开会就着急。贫农团成立后，工作组便以全力从思想、行动、组织各方面解决中农问题，首先在贫农团会上作动员，把巩固地团结中农变成他们自己的思想，打消了他们动中农的念头，让大家想想：为了填窟窿动了中农，但中农也成了窟窿又拿谁去填？为了填大窟窿又弄出一堆小窟窿怎么办？说明咱河东是穷村，村与村比较起来算是窟窿村，可以请求政府从别的较富裕的村子给填补，如附近村也没富裕土地，则可请求另想办法，或者贷款生产，或者移民。同时动员大家在行动上推动中农生产。贫农李小林都是坏地，不动弹不刨堰，想等给换了地再收拾，几个贫农便去打通他的思想，告诉他本村调剂困难，从别处想办法也不是一两天的事。孟长富还和他说：“就算能换，人家都刨了堰，你一点也不收拾，谁给你换？”把他动员起来以后，再主动的去找中农，成立互助组，贫农约定要起带头作用。另一方面酝酿成立新农会，从解释农会的权力说明了中农的政治地位，和贫中农民是一家的道理，使中农明白先成立贫农团后成立农会是一步一步走，先扶起穷兄弟，象盖房先从根基起一样，并不是不要中农。
    同时工作组同志又深入中农，开中农座谈会，以后又召开全村大会，解疙瘩：大多数中农的疙瘩都解开了，生产情绪也普遍提高，全村六个闾的互助组已组织起来，突击送粪刨堰。大家感到农具缺，做起活来这家借借、那家借借很为难，想添家具没有钱，有钱的也要等到二月二的冶陶会，一来买的家具不保险好，二来等时间误生产，三来钱又叫人家赚走了，“咱街有铁匠，旧家具也不少，大炉盘起来钢钢就能使，比新买的还顺手合心思。”贫农团、旧村长、农会主任、政治主任，筹划了一下，共同负责。农会筹借些款，村里的废铁收买一下，把窟窿户的破农具钢起来，另外再打些新的，算农会财产，登记暂借，填补的时候再算分评补。各组讨论了一下，全村要修补打造五六十件，第二天孟凡得弟兄俩的铁匠炉的火星子就冒起来了，“咱河东街的大炉盘起来了。”孟凡得说：“咱这大炉两、三年没盘过了，要不是贫农团成立起来，要盘也得到二月。”
    往年铁匠舍不得用钢，今年是大块大块往里夹，一个铁匠是共产党员，经过了整党，学会了要怎样为群众服务，要把穷弟兄们的锄＠收拾得特别耐用。
    白天，村里街上寂落落的，农民都下地了，只听见铁匠们叮当叮当地敲打和风箱的扇动，太阳落山了，两个铁匠油亮亮的脸孔仍旧闪烁在火光中聚精会神地舞着锤头，每天七把，二月二以前全村的家具可以打完了。
    六十七岁的福来奶奶用布袋装起粪分两头搭在肩头上往地里送，驻村机关的同志们经过了三查学习，都要求抽时间为驻村群众服务，除大部已参加土改工作外，又把剩余的人力、畜力组织起来帮助送粪刨堰及春耕，至三月五日为止，已为贫雇群众送粪五十九驮，八大车，二十六担，村中准备填补的十余亩学校公地，也由机关同志组织助耕，要做到不荒一亩地。
