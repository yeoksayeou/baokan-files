Breaking Through Key Points, Gradually Advancing

The facts from Zhao Village and other villages in the Ninth District of Wu'an prove how much filling gaps, party rectification, and the democratic movement align with the demands of the broad masses. As long as we announce the work guidelines to the masses, they happily say, "This is great! This time is different from the past!" Moreover, when one village does it, the impact quickly expands, and nearby villages request people to be sent to their villages one after another.

The masses' emotions and demands in various places deserve our attention. However, it should be pointed out that filling gaps, party rectification, and the democratic movement not only rectify the Party's ranks but also rectify the masses' ranks and establish democratic life inside and outside the Party. This is a very serious task and should be carried out with great caution, with careful planning and strong leadership. The method of gradually advancing in a wave-like manner is very necessary in terms of implementation. This method may seem slow at first, but the actual effect is great. It can provide the masses in nearby villages with ideological preparation and enable the working staff to break through typical examples, create experience, and more accurately grasp policies, avoiding detours. Therefore, when work teams and work groups go to the countryside, they should not disrupt the steps due to acute impatience. If there is a contradiction between the masses' request for people and the limitations of our own strength, we should adhere to the above principles, patiently persuade the masses, and avoid reckless actions to prevent problems due to lack of leadership. When Zhao Village started work in late January, the Wu'an County Party Committee clearly ordered the entire county that each district should not look at the Ninth District, and the Ninth District should not look at Zhao Village, to prevent individual village cadres from "rushing ahead" and bad elements from taking the opportunity to act recklessly. At present, work teams and work groups in various places are generally proceeding in accordance with this spirit, and it is hoped that they will pay attention to adhering to and implementing it in the future. In the past, some districts and villages in our region have seriously experienced the style of "rushing ahead" and acting rashly. It is inevitable that there are still a few people with ulterior motives who take action without the leadership's permission or have already acted without authorization. It is hoped that the leaders in various places will pay attention to this phenomenon and check and correct it.

　　突破重点逐步推进
    从武安九区赵庄等村的事实，证明了填补、整党与民主运动，是何等的符合于广大群众的要求，只要我们一向群众宣布了工作方针，群众就高兴的说：“这可好了，这次可跟过去不一样了！”而且，一个村做起来，影响即迅速扩大，附近村庄即纷纷要求派人到他们村里去。
    各地群众这种情绪与要求，值得我们予以重视。但应指出：填补、整党与民主运动，既要整顿党的队伍，又要整顿群众的队伍，建立党内外的民主生活，是一十分严肃的工作，进行时应十分慎重，应有周密的计划，坚强的领导，而在进行方式上，采取波浪式的逐步推进的办法是非常需要的。这种方式，开始看来似乎有些慢，实际效果却很大，可给附近村庄群众以思想准备，并使工作人员突破典型，创造经验，能更准确的掌握政策，少走弯路。因之，工作团与工作组下乡，不应因犯急性病混乱步骤，如果遇到群众要求派人与自己力量顾不及的矛盾时，应坚持上述原则，耐心说服群众，不要性急乱动，以免由于缺乏领导发生毛病。赵庄于一月下旬着手工作时，武安县委曾明令全县，各区不要看九区，九区不要看赵庄，防止了个别村干的“抢先”与坏分子的趁空胡乱行动。现在，各地工作团与工作组下乡，大体也都是按照这一精神进行的，希望今后注意坚持贯彻。我区若干区村，过去曾严重发生“抢先”蛮动作风，难免现仍有少数人别有企图，不经过领导允许即擅自行动，或已擅自行动，希望各地领导上对这种现象予以注意并检查纠正。
