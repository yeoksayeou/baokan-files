To the Editor Regarding the Question of New Rich Peasants and Widows and Orphans:

To the Editor:
    During land redistribution, should the land of new rich peasants be divided equally? If they refuse to give up their land, can we struggle against them? Can they also be asked, like Wu Manyou, to contribute their surplus property?

　　　　　　　Yun Wen

Comrade Yun Wen:

    The February 22nd directive from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding land reform and party rectification in old and semi-old liberated areas (published in this newspaper on February 29th) clearly stipulates the handling of land belonging to new rich peasants: "If it is necessary to draw land from new rich peasants or even prosperous middle peasants, the consent of the person being drawn from must be obtained before it can be drawn." "When drawing land from new rich peasants and middle peasants, it is extremely important to fully explain the reasons and obtain their consent; if they do not agree, concessions should be made to them, and no coercive measures should be taken." That is to say, in some places where it is necessary to draw land from new rich peasants, we must patiently explain the policy, fully promote democracy, and truly achieve conscious voluntarism, without any coercion or commandism. The typical experience of Huangjiachuan in Suide (see this newspaper on March 1st) can be used as a reference.

    Wu Manyou is a new type of rich peasant who started his business through labor under the support of the Communist Party's policies. According to the Land Law, new-style rich peasants are treated the same as middle peasants, and their floating assets are not touched. A few days ago, he sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Chairman Lin of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government, resolving to dedicate his surplus land and property to poor brothers who need these things. This is a manifestation of his increased political awareness after undergoing the Three Check-Ups Movement and studying the Land Law Outline. However, we cannot use his example to force ordinary new rich peasants to contribute their surplus property like Wu Manyou.

To the Editor:

    (1) Dividing the land equally, one share per person, is correct. However, in my village, there is an elderly couple with no children. They are very old, and their usual labor can barely support their lives. If they get seriously ill and cannot work, they will have no food at home and will have to spend money on medicine. Even if they rent out their land, the rent will not be enough to cover their food, and there will be no way to pay for medicine. They will have to sell their land. What will happen to their lives after selling their land? Won't they become poor again?

    (2) If an elderly couple dies in the future, can a single household "inherit" their property? Who will the land and property belong to after the "inheritance"?

Answer:

    Elderly, childless, and widowed people like those you mentioned should be given appropriate care during land redistribution. However, because their labor force is weak, it is generally not necessary to give them too much land. It is best to take care of them in terms of floating assets, such as depositing some pension money in the cooperative to prepare for unexpected difficulties. If the village has difficulties and cannot take good care of them, according to the February 22nd directive from the Central Committee regarding land reform and party rectification in old and semi-old liberated areas: "After adjusting the land, if there are still difficulties that cannot be resolved for the elderly, childless, widowed, and poor and hired peasants, the government should find other ways to help them solve their difficulties."

    As for who should inherit the land and property of this elderly couple after their death, they have the right to decide. It should be given to whomever they designate. However, if the elderly people do not designate an heir before their death, the land and property should be handed over to the village government for handling and cannot be given to a single household.

### 关于新富农和孤老寡妇问题

      关于新富农和孤老寡妇问题编辑同志：
    在抽补中，新富农土地是否平分？他一定不拿出土地来，是否可以斗争？是否也可象吴满有一样，拿出其多余财产？
    　　　　　　　匀文匀文同志：
    二月二十二日中共中央关于老区、半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示（本报二月二十九日登载）中，关于新富农的土地处理办法规定得很明确：“如果需要抽出新富农甚至富裕中农的土地时，必须取得被抽者的同意，方可抽动”。“对于在抽动新富农及中农的土地时，必须充分说明理由取得本人同意，甚为重要；如果本人不同意，则应向他们让步，不得采取强制办法”。这就是说，有的地方需要抽动新富农的土地时，一定要耐心解释政策，充分发扬民主，真正做到自觉自愿，不能有丝毫强迫命令，绥德黄家川抽补典型经验（见三月一日本报），可供参考。
    吴满有是在共产党政策扶植下劳动起家的新式富农。按土地法规定，新式富农与中农一样待遇，不动其浮财。前几天他打电报给毛主席和陕甘宁边区政府林主席，决心把自己的多余的土地财产献给需要这些东西的穷弟兄。这是在他经过三查运动，并学习了土地法大纲后，政治觉悟提高的表现。但我们不能拿他这个例子去强制一般新富农和吴满有一样拿出自己多余财产。
    　　　　　　编者编辑同志
    （一）平分土地，一人一份，倒也对，象我村有老俩口，也没儿子，年纪很大，平常劳动也能顾住生活，若要得了大病，不能生产劳动，家里就没有粮食吃，还得吃药花钱，就是把地租出去，租子也不够吃，药钱没法，还得卖地，把地卖了以后生活怎办？这不是又得受穷了？
    （二）有个老俩口子，以后死了，他有一家一户是不是能“承受”呢？“承受”了以后土地财产归给谁？
    　　　郭村医院
    答：象你所提那样的孤寡老人，在抽补中应适当给予照顾，但因为他劳力不强，一般不必多给土地，最好在浮财方面能照顾一下，如在合作社给存些养老金等，以准备有意外困难时使用。若村里有困难不能照顾得好，根据二月二十二日中央中央关于老区、半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示中规定的：“在调剂土地以后，对于孤老寡妇及贫雇农中仍有困难不能解决者，政府应另行设法帮助其解决困难”。
    至于这老俩口子死后土地财产应由谁继承，他们自己有权利决定，指定给谁就给谁，但假若老人死前没有指定继承人，则土地财产应交村政府处理，而不能归给一家一户。
