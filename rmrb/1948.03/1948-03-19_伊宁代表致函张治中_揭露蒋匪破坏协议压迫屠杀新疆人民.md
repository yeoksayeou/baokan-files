    Yining Representatives Write to Zhang Zhizhong
  　Exposing Chiang Kai-shek Bandits' Sabotage of the Agreement, Oppression, and Slaughter of the People of Xinjiang

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th] According to recent reports in Chiang-controlled newspapers: Ahmetjan and Rakhimjan, representatives of the Yining Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, wrote to Zhang Zhizhong, Director of Chiang Kai-shek's Northwest Headquarters, the year before last, exposing the Chiang Kai-shek authorities' continued acts of sowing discord, oppressing, and slaughtering the people of Xinjiang after signing a peace agreement with the Autonomous Region in 1946, and their conspiracy to deprive the people of Xinjiang of their right to national autonomy. The letter first pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had sabotaged the agreement, creating an intolerable environment, forcing them to be unable to continue staying in Dihua (note: they left Dihua in July last year to return to Yili). It further pointed out that before the signing of the agreement, the Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Xinjiang Province numbered only 20,000 to 25,000, but later increased to six divisions of 80,000, creating a situation of distrust and fear among the people of Xinjiang. The Chiang side not only never implemented the clause that national troops should be treated equally with Chiang's "Central Army," but also dispatched Chiang's troops to sabotage the peace agreement and occupy the territories of Yili, Ashan, Tacheng, and other areas. They also actively organized armed forces, such as utilizing Osman, who betrayed the people of Xinjiang, providing him with ammunition, food, and even military staff, directing him to attack peaceful residents in the Ashan area. After the counties of Xinjiang implemented the election of administrative officials in accordance with the 1946 regulations, and many Chiang Kai-shek corrupt officials were rejected by the people, the Chiang Kai-shek troops and police agencies began to interfere in administration, actually usurping political power, making it impossible for the elected officials to perform their duties. Chiang Kai-shek's military police and secret agents also intimidated the Muslim masses and their representatives at all levels of administrative organs, and carried out large-scale arrests, torture, and slaughter, illegally arresting democratic elements in southern Xinjiang and Dihua, Hami, and other areas, and rudely violating the provisions of Article 11 of the peace agreement. Freedom of body, speech, publication, assembly, and association was ruthlessly destroyed. When the agreement was signed, Zhang Zhizhong declared the abolition of secret service agencies and stipulated that police agencies should be composed of local people. However, the secret police were not only not abolished but were further expanded. On March 5th last year, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents carried out a large-scale search of the Muslim masses in Dihua City, not only without notifying Ahmetjan, the vice-chairman representing the Muslims, in advance, but also prohibiting him from going out afterward. On the other hand, they incited various reactionary organizations controlled by them to threaten and undermine the democratic organizations of the people of Xinjiang. The letter accused Chiang Kai-shek's troops of causing massacres of Hui people and many brutal acts in Kuqa, Heizi Li, Yutian, Kumush, and other places, and large-scale massacres of Muslims in Bingdaban, Suilai, Turpan, Dihua, and other places, arresting Shabiti Hari, Aishan Aji, Tuer Song Ahong, and others in Yingjisha, and slaughtering Ai Niwai Er Yusufu, an employee of the Department of Education. The letter revealed that the Chiang side disregarded the opinions of the majority of the people and appointed the reactionary landlord Mesut as the chairman of the province; appointed Hazhong Wan as the commissioner of the Dihua area and Jani Mukhan as the director of the Department of Finance, and removed the elected Abudukerim Hammasum as the commissioner of Kashgar. These facts have made it impossible for the Yining side to tolerate any longer. The letter finally demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits prohibit the suppression of democrats, release the arrested Hui people, replace Mesut, and fully comply with the agreement signed in June 1946.

　　伊宁代表致函张治中
  　揭露蒋匪破坏协议压迫屠杀新疆人民
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据蒋区报纸近载：新疆伊宁自治区代表阿合买提江和赖希木江曾于前年致函蒋匪西北行辕主任张治中，揭露蒋匪当局在一九四六年与自治区订立和平条款后，继续进行挑拨离间，压迫屠杀新疆人民，阴谋剥夺新疆人民的民族自治权利等罪恶。该书首先指出蒋匪破坏了协议，造成了不可忍耐的环境，迫使他们无法继续留于迪化（按：他们系于去年七月离迪化返伊犁）。继指出：在条款签订之前，新省蒋匪驻军不过二万至二万五千人，后竟增达六个师八万之众，给新疆人民造成不信任及恐惧的情况。蒋方不但从未实行民族军队应与蒋记“中央军”同等待遇的条款，而且派遣蒋军破坏和平条款侵占伊犁、阿山、塔城等区的领土。并积极组织武装部队如利用叛卖新疆人民的乌斯满，给以弹药粮饷甚至军事参谋人员等，指使其向阿山区和平居民进攻。新疆各县依照四六年规定，实行了行政官吏选举，蒋匪贪官污吏多为人民所摈弃之后，蒋匪军队及警察机关开始干涉行政，实际篡夺了政权，使民选官吏无法执行职务，蒋匪军警特务并对回教大众及其各级行政机构中的代表，实施威吓，大肆逮捕、拷打、屠杀，在南疆及迪化、哈密等区非法逮捕民主分子，粗暴地破坏了和平条款十一条的规定。身体、言论、出版、集会、结社等自由被无情的摧残着。签订条款时，张治中曾声明取消特务机关，规定警察机关由当地人民组成。但秘密警察非但没有取消，而且更予扩大。去年三月五日蒋匪特务对迪化市回教徒群众实行大搜查，不但事前没有通知代表回教徒的副主席阿合买提江本人，而且事后禁止了他的外出。另一方面则又煽动当地各御用反动组织，以威胁和破坏新疆人民的民主组织。函中控述蒋匪军曾在库车、黑孜里、于阗、库木什以及其他各地造成屠杀回族人民的血案及很多残暴行为，在冰达坂、绥来、吐鲁番、迪化等地大规模的屠杀回教徒，逮捕英吉沙的沙比提哈日、艾山阿吉、土尔宋阿洪等人，并屠杀教厅职员艾尼外尔玉素甫。该书揭露：蒋方不顾多数人民的意见，任反动地主麦斯武德为省主席；委派哈种万为迪化区专员及贾尼木汗为财厅长，并免去民选的阿不都克日木合马苏木之喀什专员职务。此种事实，已使伊宁方面再也不能忍受。该书最后要求蒋匪禁止压制民主人士，释放被捕回民，撤换麦斯武德，充分遵守四六年六月所签订之协议。
