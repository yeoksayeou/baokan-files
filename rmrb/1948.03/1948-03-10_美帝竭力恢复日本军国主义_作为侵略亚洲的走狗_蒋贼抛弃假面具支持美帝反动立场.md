Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th—U.S. imperialism has openly expressed its position of tearing up the Potsdam Agreement and reviving Japanese militarism. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has also discarded its last mask and unconditionally supports this position of U.S. imperialism. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on February 26, senior U.S. officials told United Press reporters that Marshall's dispatch of his high-level foreign policy advisor, Kennan, to Japan indicates that the United States now intends to "drastically change" its policy toward Japan. The senior official admitted that the United States has decided to abandon its position on Japan held at the Potsdam Conference in order to vigorously restore Japan as a "bulwark against communism" in Asia. If this famous diplomatic lie is translated into ordinary human language, it means vigorously restoring Japan as a bulwark for implementing U.S. imperialist aggression policies in Asia. It is worth recalling that the content of MacArthur's suggestions to Marshall revealed by this agency on January 21 is completely consistent with the goals of Marshall's two dispatches of Kennan to Japan. The inside story of Kennan's visit to Japan revealed by senior U.S. officials proves that Marshall fully supports MacArthur's suggestions. Marshall's policy toward Japan is MacArthur's policy toward Japan. The Chinese people certainly know what the significance of restoring Japanese aggressive forces is, and they know that the U.S. policy toward Japan has not actually undergone any "drastic changes," but it is just that the past superficial propaganda was not as shameless as it is now. The Chinese people also deeply know what position the traitor Chiang Kai-shek takes on this, although Chiang Kai-shek has tried to conceal his true colors. A United Press dispatch from Nanjing on February 25 also proves the Chinese people's foresight on this issue. The dispatch quoted a Nanjing authoritative source as saying that China's attitude toward the Japan issue has recently undergone a "fundamental change" and is tending to actually conform to U.S. policy. The authoritative source announced that the Chiang Kai-shek government "now believes that the settlement of the Japanese peace treaty issue is not as important as Japan's economic recovery, which will enable Japan to participate in the global policy of resisting communism." This theory of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek shows how hard he has worked to memorize Washington's fairy tales, so that what he says is exactly the same, not even a single word different. The authoritative source revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has decided to withdraw its hypocritical posture of not participating in a peace conference with Japan that does not include the Soviet Union and exercising the veto power of the four powers in that conference. At the same time, it has decided to express satisfaction with MacArthur's policy of ruling Japan and the U.S. proposal on Japan's industrial level, and is "considering reducing the claim for reparations from Japan from two billion U.S. dollars to between one billion and one and a half billion U.S. dollars." The authoritative source specifically pointed out that this "fundamental change" of the Chiang Kai-shek government, of course, is also merely a "change" in the facial muscle expression of the actor, "is done by Wang Shijie, the prudent foreign minister of the government." It is generally believed that this so-called authoritative source, who is so familiar with the inside information of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, is obviously no one else, but can only be the "authoritative source" who pulls the strings behind the scenes for the Nanjing puppet. It is very likely that it is the number one representative of the U.S. imperialist aggressors in China, John Leighton Stuart, himself.

　　美帝竭力恢复日本军国主义
  　作为侵略亚洲的走狗
    蒋贼抛弃假面具支持美帝反动立场
    【新华社陕北六日电】美帝国主义者已公开表示其撕毁波茨顿协定，恢复日本军国主义的立场；同时蒋介石匪帮亦抛弃其最后的假面具，无条件支持美帝国主义者的此种立场。据合众社华盛顿二月二十六日电，美高级官方人士告合众社记者称：马歇尔派遣其外交政策高等顾问凯南赴日一事，乃表示现在美国意欲“剧烈改变”其对日政策。该高级官员承认：美国已决定放弃其在波茨顿会议中所持之对日立场，以便竭力恢复日本为在亚洲“抵制共产主义的堡垒”。如果把这句著名的外交鬼话，翻译成人类的通常语言，那就是说竭力恢复日本为在亚洲执行美帝国主义侵略政策的堡垒。值得回忆的，是本社一月廿一日所揭露的麦克阿瑟对马歇尔的建议内容与马歇尔两派遣凯南赴日的目标完全符合。美高级官员所透露的凯南赴日的内幕，证明马歇尔完全支持麦克阿瑟的建议，马歇尔的对日政策，就是麦克阿瑟的对日政策，中国人民当然知道恢复日本侵略势力的意义是什么，并且知道美国对日政策，实际上并无任何“剧烈改变”，不过是过去表面宣传还没有现在这样无耻而已。中国人民同样深知：卖国贼蒋介石对此采取何种立场，虽然蒋介石曾力图掩盖自己的真实面目。合众社二月二十五日南京电，也证明了中国人民在这个问题上的预见。该电引南京权威人士的谈话称：中国对日本问题的态度，近来已有“基本改变”；并趋向于与美国政策实际上相符合。该权威人士宣布蒋介石政府“现认为日本和约问题的解决，尚不及日本经济复员重要，后者将使日本得以参加抵制共产主义的全球政策”。卖国贼蒋介石的这个理论，表明他曾经何等用功的背诵了华盛顿的童话，以致说出来连一个字也不差。该权威人士透露：蒋介石匪帮已经决定撤消其关于不参加不包括苏联的对日和会，与在该和会中行使四强否决权的虚伪姿态；同时决定对麦克阿瑟统治日本的政策与美国对日本工业水平的提案，表示满意，并“正考虑将对日赔偿要求由二十亿美元减至十亿与十五亿之间”。该权威人士具体的指明：蒋介石政府的这种“基本改变”，当然同样仅仅是演员面部肌肉表情上的“改变”，“系政府稳健的外交部长王世杰所为”。一般相信，这个所谓权威人士，如此熟悉蒋介石匪帮的内情，显然不是别人，而只能是替南京傀儡在后台牵线的“权威人士”，很可能就是美帝国主义侵略者在华的第一号代表司徒雷登自己。
