　　Correspondence
  　No. 20
    I. Comrade Jia Shumei, Second District, Qiu County: Your letter points out that the peasant voice "County and District Cadres Protect Village Cadres" published in this newspaper's No. 619 issue is somewhat inconsistent with the facts. However, your letter states: "Xie Jinqing is not a rich peasant and is still a middle peasant," but it does not provide specific conditions, making it impossible to judge the facts. It would be best if you could write in detail about the changes in Xie Jinqing himself and his son's land before and after the mass movement. In addition, your statement that "there was no private sale of public bricks" and "there was no embezzlement of local grain" does not provide sufficient facts and evidence. We hope you will supplement the materials and fully explain the reasons in order to clarify the truth. The peasant voices, criticisms, and suggestions published in the newspaper completely allow readers and relevant parties to raise different opinions, but it is necessary to present their own sufficient facts and evidence, and to be realistic and sincere.
    II. Comrades Qi Guihe of Qijialing, Fifth District, Ci County, Li Bingding of Dongshu, Third District, She County, the Workers' Reading Newspaper Correspondence Group of Baijiazhuang, Liuhegou, Jipu, Lin Lan, Qingxin, Yongnian Shizhuang, and Fan Su of Hujialou, Xingtai: The issues you have raised, either by proxy, direct letter, or directly to the newspaper office, have been sent to the relevant authorities for investigation and processing.

    一、邱县二区贾书梅同志：你来信指出本报六一九号登载的农民呼声“县区干部包庇村干”和事实有些出入。但你的来信所说：“谢金清并不是富农，现在仍是中农”，没有说明具体条件，无法判断事实如何，最好请你把谢金清本人和他的儿子在群运前后土地变化详细写来。另外你声明：“没有私卖公砖”，“并没贪污地方粮的事情”，也没有提出充分事实和证据，希补充材料，充分说明理由，以便弄清是非真象。报纸所登的农民呼声，批评与建议，是完全允许读者与有关方面提出不同意见，但须要提出自己充分的事实和证据，以及做到实事求是与诚恳坦白。
    二、磁县五区齐家岭齐贵合、涉县三区东戍李丙丁、六合沟百家庄工人读报通讯组、吉普、林岚、庆新、永年施庄、邢台胡家楼樊苏诸同志：你们代笔、直接写信，或者直接来报馆所诉问题，已分别送有关机关调查处理。
