Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: The second economic storm in the Chiang-controlled areas this year, which has lasted for more than a month, has not yet abated. "The panic in Shanghai's commodity and financial markets has caused prices to rise to even more dizzying levels" (Reuters). On the 10th, the black market US dollar rose from 420,000 Jiang currency on the 9th to 440,000; gold rose from 24.8 million per tael to 27 million; Chinese and foreign stocks rose by 10% to 20% in one day. The upward trend was even fiercer on the 11th, with the black market US dollar rising to 500,000, more than double the beginning of the year, and gold rising to 30 million. The daily increase rate of Chinese and foreign stocks was as high as 15% to 20%. Simultaneously with the rapid advance of the financial market, "the prices of most important commodities have risen sharply" (Agence France-Presse). As early as the 10th, "due to the rapid depreciation of the 'legal (Chiang) currency'," retailers had already stopped using price tags" (Reuters) in order to reduce prices at any time and avoid losses. Reuters pointed out that one of the main reasons for the continuous surge in the Shanghai market was the "disastrous defeat" of the Chiang bandit troops in the Northeast. The panic-stricken Chiang bandit authorities, at the "National Economic Commission" meeting held on the 11th, also admitted that "the recent sharp fluctuations in prices in Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan and other places are mainly due to the impact of floating capital in the Northeast." As the Chiang bandit's military crisis directly promotes the development of its economic crisis, the duration and speed of price fluctuations in the Chiang-controlled areas this year have far exceeded those of last year. The price fluctuations in the Chiang-controlled areas from the end of January to the beginning of February last year lasted only two weeks before entering a period of respite, and prices rose by only one time.

　　上海物价涨得更凶
  　金融市场惊惶不安
    【新华社陕北十三日电】延续一月有余的蒋区今年第二次经济风暴迄未稍停，“上海商品与金融市场的惊惶不安，已使价格上涨到更令人昏眩的程度”（路透社）。十日黑市美钞由九日的蒋币四十二万涨到四十四万，黄金每两由二千四百八十万涨到二千七百万，中外股票一天内上涨百分之十到二十；十一日涨势更凶，黑市美钞已涨达五十万元，较年初涨了两倍多，黄金涨到三千万，中外股票一日内的上涨率竟为百分之十五至二十。与金融市场猛进同时，“大多数重要商品的价格都大大上涨”（法新社）。还在十日，“由于‘法（蒋）币’贬值太快，零售商即已停止使用价格标签”（路透社），以便随时减价，避免损失。路透社指出，上海市场不断暴涨的主要原因之一，是东北蒋匪军的“惨败”。惊慌失措的蒋匪当局，于十一日举行的“全国经济委员会”会议中，亦承认“最近津、沪、汉等地物价的急剧波动，主要原因系受东北游资影响。”由于蒋匪军事危机直接推动其经济危机发展，今年蒋区物价波动时间的延续与上涨的速度，均已远超去年。蒋区去年一月底至二月初的物价波动为时仅两周即进入间歇期，物价上涨也不过一倍。
