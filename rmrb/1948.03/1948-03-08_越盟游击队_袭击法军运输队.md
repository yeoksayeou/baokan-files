Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Saigon dispatch: Viet Minh guerrillas are becoming increasingly active. One night, between Saigon and Cholon, a strong guerrilla force of 2,500 men fiercely attacked a French military convoy. After three hours of fighting, they achieved a complete victory. According to French sources: of the 560 French escort troops, 60 were killed, and only 8 have escaped back to the French headquarters. Of the convoy's vehicles, 62 were destroyed, with only 12 large trucks and several armored vehicles managing to escape. Prior to the attack, Viet Minh guerrillas, with the assistance of residents, had felled trees to block the roads the French military might have used to escape. Furthermore, a Hanoi dispatch states: the Haiphong-Hanoi bus derailed on the 29th of last month. A landmine planted by Viet Minh guerrillas caused serious damage to the locomotive, killing the driver, and damaging eleven carriages.
