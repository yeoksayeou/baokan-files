    Capturing Luoyang City
    Feng Mu

    When Li Buzhou's unit, the combat heroes of the Luoyang assault, received the mission to attack the west gate of Luoyang on the 12th, Li said, "It is an honor to shed our blood on the city of Luoyang." At that time, Luoyang was completely surrounded, and the enemy was stubbornly resisting with fortifications built over many years. Outside the west gate was an outer city full of hidden bunkers. The bunkers on the northwest wall were as numerous as honeycombs. The outer moat was too wide to cross, and to get from Xiguan to the west city, one had to pass a long bridge filled with chevaux-de-frise and hidden bunkers.

    The general attack began at noon in the rain. The artillery first destroyed most of the enemy's significant fortifications within range. As the bugle sounded, soldiers like Li Shirong rushed forward through the mud, cutting through the barbed wire with a guillotine knife. Then a flash of fire, the outer city wall shuddered and a large gap was blown in the thick smoke. Li Buzhou led his soldiers out of the hole in the wall and rushed towards the bridgehead through half a foot of mud. Li Buzhou charged across the bridgehead, and was wounded, but still struggled to climb towards the city. Rows of grenades exploded on the great city wall, and some soldiers stuffed grenades into the holes of the hidden bunkers. Wang Yingsheng, the squad leader of the Seventh Squad, carried a basket of grenades in one hand and a submachine gun in the other, shouting, "Our Third Platoon is here!" He climbed up the gap in the city wall in two steps, and swept the inside with his submachine gun. Even Chang An Tinglan was the first to jump onto the gap, and assault team members rushed in one by one from beside him.

    After rushing into the outer city, the two companies of enemies entrenched inside collapsed. Our soldiers kept stuffing grenades into the enemy's fortifications. Wang Yingsheng fired several baskets of grenades, and when he ran out, he crawled into the enemy's fortifications to find more. Many people's arms were swollen from throwing grenades.

    The enemies within the city circle were wiped out, but the second city gate was still tightly closed, and the enemies on the city tower were still stubbornly resisting. An enemy battalion commander was on top, and the telephone was ringing. As our assault team's grenades and mountain guns rang out again, the first shot hit Chiang Kai-shek's portrait on the city tower, and the second shot hit the enemy's command post on the left side of the city tower. The telephone was blown into the sky, and the remaining enemies fled from the last stronghold. Our valiant soldiers immediately tracked them down.

    The city gate was opened, and the troops rushed in in rows. Enemy wounded and dead horses lay everywhere on the tall buildings of Luoyang Avenue. Our troops began a deep pursuit of the enemy.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yushanese Front, 20th] After our capture of Luoyang, the captured officers and soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's Youth Army 206th Division were very surprised by the powerful artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, which destroyed the Luoyang city defense fortifications that they thought were unbreakable. Wang Juyou, a soldier from the First Battalion of the First Regiment of the division, said: "The fortifications of Luoyang City were built over several years, and almost every place that could be used for defense had fortifications. The underground traffic trenches were two or three miles long, and most of the bunkers were covered with steel plates. Our division commander, Qiu Xingxiang, always said in his speeches that Luoyang's fortifications were solid, but with the existing firepower of the Communist Army, they would never be able to enter Luoyang. But now you have crushed us like grinding flour." Zhao Jiuru, the squad leader of the division headquarters' search battalion, said: "We used to think that as long as we built the defense fortifications well, you would retreat as soon as you touched them. Who would have thought that you would break into the city and surround our division headquarters? After two days of shelling, I completely changed my past belief that you could not open up big cities." Lei Tianyun, a youth soldier from the Sixth Regiment who was captured at Zhougong Temple, said: "When we were defending Zhougong Temple, Battalion Commander Fang (referring to Fang Jinglin, who had already been captured) told us every day: The Communist Army mainly relies on mobile warfare, and they are not good at attacking fortifications. He also said that Zhougong Temple is the gateway to Luoyang, and has the latest double-layer bag-shaped group fortifications. If the Communist Army wants to attack, it is tantamount to throwing themselves into a trap. But soon after he said this, you attacked and came in. The 'bag-shaped fortifications' didn't trap you, but trapped us."

    攻进洛阳城
    冯牧
    攻进洛阳的战斗英雄李步周部十二日接受了攻击洛阳西门的任务时，李说：“把我们的血流在洛阳城上是光荣的”。那时洛阳四面已被围得水泄不通，敌人凭借多年来修筑的工事顽抗着，西门外有一道满布暗碉的外城，西北墙上碉堡多得象蜂窝一样，外壕宽得根本无法越过，从西关到西城必须通过一道长桥，布满拒马和暗碉。
    总攻击冒着雨在中午开始，炮兵先把火力范围以内敌人显著工事大部摧毁。冲锋号响了，战士李士荣等踏着泥泞飞奔过去，用铡刀砍断铁丝网，跟着火光一闪，外城墙象打了个寒噤在浓烟中炸出一个大缺口。李步周率领的战士从墙洞中一跃而出，在半尺深的泥泞里跨向桥头冲去，李步周冲过了桥头，他挂彩了，但还挣扎着向城上爬。战士们一排排的炸弹在大城墙上爆炸了，有的战士把炸弹从暗碉孔里塞进去。七班班长王英生一手提了一篮炸弹，一手提着手提机枪喊了一声我们三排上来了，两步爬上了城墙缺口，用手提机枪向里面扫射，连长安廷兰也先跳上了缺口，突击队员们一个个从他身边冲进。
    冲进外城，踞守在里面的敌人两个连溃乱了。我们的战士不停歇地向敌工事中塞着炸弹，王英生连打了几篮炸弹，没有了便钻进敌人的工事里去找，许多人因打炸弹把胳膊都累肿了。
    城圈内的敌人肃清了，但第二道城门还紧闭着，城楼上的敌人还在顽抗，敌人一个营指挥员在上面响着电话铃，随着我突击队的炸弹和山炮又响了，第一炮正打中城楼上的蒋贼画像，第二炮打在城楼左面敌人指挥所，电话机打得飞上了天空，残余的敌人从最后的据点逃出来乱钻，我健儿们即跟踪追去。
    城门洞开了，队伍一列列地冲进去，楼房高耸的洛阳大街上到处卧着敌人的伤兵和死马。我们的队伍开始纵深的向敌人追击着。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十日电】我攻克洛阳后，被俘之蒋青年军二○六师官兵，十分惊讶解放军的强大炮火，摧毁了他们认为牢不可破的洛阳城防工事。该师第一团一营士兵王居友说：“洛阳城的工事，是经过好几年的建筑，几乎每一个可以用来防御的地方都建有工事，地下交通壕长达二三里，大部地碉都用钢板盖成的，我们师长邱行湘每次讲话总是说洛阳的工事坚固，但凭共军现有的火力休想进入洛阳。可是现在你们却象推磨一样，一下子就把我们给推碎了”。师部搜索营的班长赵九如说：“我们过去总以为只要把防御工事修得好，给你们碰一下就会退走的，谁想到你们打进城把我们师部包围了，受了两天炮轰，把我过去不相信你们能打开大城市的想法完全改变了。”在周公庙被俘的六团青年兵雷天云说：“我们守周公庙的时候，方团长（指方景林已被俘）每天对我们说：共军主要靠打运动战，一攻坚就不行了，并且说周公庙是洛阳的门户，有最新式的双层袋形集团工事，共军要攻，无异自投罗网，可是这话说了不久，你们就攻进来了，‘袋形工事’没有把你们装住，倒把我们装住了”。
