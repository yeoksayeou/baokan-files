Reader-Editor Interactions
　　Titles should not cause misunderstanding
　　To the responsible comrades of People's Daily:
　　Please pay attention to whether the titles of news stories will cause misunderstanding among readers in the future. Here are two examples:
　　On February 4th, the first page had:
　　"My Overturn is Just an Empty Name"　柴任平 (Chai Renping)
　　It is easy to misunderstand that the writer, Chai Renping, said he had an empty overturn. Also, the first news item on the second page of March 1st: "Czech Political Situation Cleared Up, Reactionaries Suffered Crushing Blow," readers often misread it as a short phrase "Czech Political Situation Cleared Up, Reactionaries," with a slight pause, then continue reading "Suffered a Crushing Blow," and the meaning is completely misunderstood.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cai Shi

　　Cai Shi's point that the two titles are prone to misunderstanding is very correct and should be overcome in future work.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　--Editor

　　Has another mistake been made?
　　To the editorial comrades:
　　After reading the "Reader-Editor Interactions" published on the first page of the Party newspaper on March 10th, I first saw Comrade Gao Shuangqiu's suggestion that your newspaper's "typesetting comrades are not careful enough." At the same time, you also reviewed saying that it was carelessness and sloppiness in the work, and you proposed that in the future, attention should be paid to careful and precise typesetting and proofreading. I think this review is not sincere enough, and saying: "At least no major errors occur," isn't this giving some comrades who are careless in their work a burden? Can small errors still be unavoidable? I think it is necessary to be truthful to be a good long-term worker for the people willingly. I am not intentionally nitpicking. If you don't believe me, continue reading and you will encounter "Reply to the Marriage Case of Li Tushui," which again makes people unclear. Is this case a matter of Wu Xiang or Wu An? Looking at the previous title and the reply on March 1st, they are all from the Wu Xiang Civil Affairs Section, but looking at the content, it is indeed the case of Li Tushui from Sanwang Village, San District, Wu An, complaining that Li Shuanni occupied his wife. I think it is not strange to have the same name, and the same event may happen, but how can the Wu Xiang Civil Affairs Section reply to the matter of Wu An? I'm afraid the proofreading comrades were careless again?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang Junde

　　Comrade Junde is right to think that newspapers should be truthful and error-free.
　　The case of Li Tushui from Sanwang Village, Wu An, suing Li Shuanni for occupying his wife, is because Li Shuanni is from Wu Xiang, so this letter was answered by the Wu Xiang Civil Affairs Section. This letter is not wrong.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　--Editor

　　　　Please Yong Maochang Comrade Reply
　　Editorial Comrades:
　　On March 9th, the newspaper published that two-thirds of the villages in the Eighth District of Wu An have completely stopped weaving, but I don't know if the two-thirds stop is calculated by village or by female labor? Please give specific instructions. I also don't know which village Comrade Yong Maochang wrote the letter from and what specific materials are. I hope you can give further instructions to promote the work, because the old cadres in the district have been completely transferred and the new cadres do not yet understand the situation. Please reply as soon as possible.

　　　　What is "Returning Land"?
　　A reader wrote to ask about the term "returning land" in the Shaanxi Northern Shaanxi Land Reform news, and did not know how to explain it. The explanation is as follows:
　　"Returning Land" refers to the land that had been distributed to farmers during the land revolution period in some areas of Northern Shaanxi. When the area was occupied by the Chiang bandits, the land was taken away and handed over to the landlords. When the area was recovered, the democratic government returned the land taken by the landlords to the farmers, which is called "Returning Land". There has been a "Returning Land" movement in both the Guanzhong and Suide sub-districts.

### 编读往来

第2版()
专栏：

　　编读往来
  　标题不要引起误解人民日报负责同志：
    请你们今后注意新闻的标题，是否会引起读者的误解。现举两个例子于下：
    二月四日第一版有：
    我翻身是个空名子　柴任平容易误写稿人柴任平说自己翻了个空身。又三月一日第二版第一条消息：“捷克政局澄清反动派遭到粉碎性打击”，看的人往往会误读为“捷克政局澄清反动派”一短句后，略为一停，继读“遭到粉碎性打击”，意思就完全误解了。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　采石
    采石同志所指的两个标题易引起误解很对，当在今后工作中注意克服。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　--编者
    是否又出了错？编辑同志：
    看了三月十日党报一版登载：“编读往来”，首先发表了高双秋同志提议贵报“排报的同志不够细心”，同时你们也检讨说：是工作上的马虎草率，并且你们提出今后在排字校对工作方面应注意仔细精确，这样检讨我认为还不够诚意，并说：“至少不发生大错误”，如果这样说不是又给一些工作上粗枝大叶的同志背了个包袱吗？小错误还可以免不了吗？我认为必须做到真实，才是服服贴贴的给人民当个好长工。我说这话并不是有意吹求。如果不信，再往下看就碰上又发表了：“对李土金婚姻案的答复”，又闹的使人懂不清，这案件究竟是武乡的事呢？还是武安的事呢？看前面的标题和后面三月一日的答复，都是武乡民政科，但看内容确实是武安三区三王村李土金诉苦李拴妮霸占他妻之事。我想同样一个姓名也不奇怪，同样的事件也许会有；但武乡民政科怎么还能答复武安的事呢？恐怕又是校对同志粗心了吧？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王峻德
    峻德同志认为报纸应做到真实，不出错误是很对的。
    武安三王村李土金诉李拴妮霸占他妻案件，因李拴妮是武乡人，故此信系由武乡民政科所答，此信并未错。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　--编者
    　　　　请永茂昌同志答复编辑同志：
    三月九日报上登着武安八区有三分之二的村子完全停止纺织，但不知是按村子计算三分之二停止，亦不知是按妇女劳力来计算？请具体指示，永茂昌同志写信亦不知是在哪个村子，具体材料如何？望再指示，以便推动。因为区上旧的干部完全调动，新来的干部还不了解情况。请答复为盼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　八区　杨秀华　郑广善
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　三月十四日
    　　　　何谓归地？
    有读者来信问陕北土改消息有“归地”一词不知作何解释。兹特说明如下：
    归地是指陕北某些地区过去土地革命时期已经分配给农民的土地，当该地被蒋匪侵占时，将土地夺去交给地主，当该地被收复，民主政府又将地主夺去的土地归还农民，叫做归地。在关中、绥德两分区均有过归地运动。
