Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: All circles in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region held a solemn memorial meeting for Vice Chairman Li Dingming in the city of Sui on February 25th. The venue was surrounded by elegiac couplets from leaders of the Border Region and various liberated areas' Party, government, and military organs, as well as from the masses. In the center of the altar was a portrait of Vice Chairman Li, flanked by elegies from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. At 2:00 PM, amid the sound of salutes and mournful music, the chief mourner, Chairman Lin Boqu of the Border Region Government, and accompanying mourners, Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC, Deputy Commander of the Joint Defense Command Wang Weizhou, and commissioners and county heads participating in the mourning, took their seats in order. Thousands of people stood in solemn silence to pay their respects to this "enlightened gentleman who, during the difficult period of the Chinese people's national democratic struggle, resolutely cooperated with the Chinese Communist Party out of a sense of justice" (Chairman Mao's elegy) and made many beneficial contributions to the cause of people's democracy. After the public memorial ceremony, Chairman Lin delivered a speech, stating: "Just as the revolutionary war of the Chinese people against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is about to achieve victory throughout the country, the death of Vice Chairman Li is a major loss to our promotion and implementation of the New Democratic regime." Chairman Lin recalled his seven years of close cooperation with the late Vice Chairman Li, saying: "Vice Chairman Li was one of the first enlightened gentlemen to respond to the Chinese Communist Party's call to unite all classes. He loved our nation and the Border Region. He realized that only by implementing the CPC's policies and Chairman Mao's proposals could we defeat the enemies of the people and manage the affairs of the Chinese people well. Despite his advanced age of sixty, he actively and tirelessly participated in the work of the Border Region government, wholeheartedly hoping for the victory of the New China." Chairman Lin called on everyone to commemorate Vice Chairman Li by working hard to develop production, protect and develop industry and commerce, and do a good job in supporting the front and liberating the Great Northwest. Comrade Xi Zhongxun stated in his speech: "The death of Vice Chairman Li has caused the people of the Border Region to lose a good vice chairman and the Communist Party to lose a good friend." Comrade Xi highly praised Vice Chairman Li for cooperating with our Party from the most difficult stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan until today, when the People's Liberation Army has entered a full-scale offensive, as well as his enlightened views in his dying words, agreeing with the Land Law Outline and agreeing with the thorough completion of land reform. He said: "Vice Chairman Li is a representative of patriotic people, and his path indicates the direction of struggle for the broad middle-class democrats in the Northwest." After speeches by Deputy Commander Wang and Northwest educator Yang Mingxuan, Mr. An Wenqin, Vice Chairman of the Border Region参议会 , delivered a speech, saying: "We mourn Vice Chairman Li today because he was of noble character, progressive in his thinking, supported the propositions of the Communist Party, and made great efforts in the construction of the Border Region while serving as Vice Chairman of the Border Government." Vice Chairman An said: "Vice Chairman Li's will endorsed the Chinese Land Law Outline and the thorough distribution of land, and I also endorse it. Since the feudal system was established in China, the inequality of wealth and suffering in rural areas has been formed. The rich own fields that stretch for miles, while the poor have no land to stand on. Landlords gain without labor and eat without farming, which is the most unreasonable. Today, when we mourn Vice Chairman Li, we should inherit his legacy, endorse land reform, and hand over my land, only keeping what I deserve. I want to stand on the same road as the people and get rid of the title of this land parasite." At the meeting, Li Changying, representing Taozhen Primary School, which was founded by Vice Chairman Li, and on behalf of the Board of Directors of Taozhen Primary School, proposed renaming Taozhen Primary School as Dingming Primary School for permanent commemoration. Subsequently, Li Zhenshan, the eldest son of Vice Chairman Li, delivered a reply on behalf of the family. He first thanked the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Party, government, military, and people of all liberated areas and border regions for their condolences on the death of Vice Chairman Li. He then recounted that since his father was elected Vice Chairman of the Border Government in 1941, he had supported New Democracy, cooperated sincerely with the Communist Party, and demonstrated a responsible and excellent spirit in his work. He also reported on the course of his illness. He said: "Since the Hu bandits attacked the Border Region in March of last year, my father, with his aging body, traveled through mountains and rivers, working diligently, and fell ill due to overwork. In August, he suffered from coughs and tremors, and blood often flowed from both ears. After my personal treatment, it was slightly effective, but he did not recover completely. However, he returned to the Border Government and insisted on working while ill. On the evening of December 9th last year, his condition suddenly worsened. I and doctors Zhang Jiefu and others from the health department of the Joint Defense Army consulted twice and diagnosed him with a cerebral hemorrhage. After repeated treatments, he finally passed away at 9:00 AM on the 11th due to old age and serious illness, saying goodbye to us forever." Suppressing his grief, Mr. Li Zhenshan swore before the spirit tablet: "My father's death was caused by the heinous invasion of the Chiang-Hu bandit army. We swear before my father's spirit tablet and in the presence of leaders and all comrades that we will turn grief into strength. Nine members of our family have already participated in revolutionary work, and we will forever inherit our father's will and fight to the end for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Finally, the meeting approved the proposal of the funeral committee to erect a monument in Vice Chairman Li's hometown and inscribe Vice Chairman Li's achievements in building the Border Region, so as to never forget them.
Elegy
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: At the memorial service for Mr. Li Dingming, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and various liberated areas all sent elegies and telegrams of condolence:

All truly patriotic democratic enlightened gentlemen who oppose imperialist aggression, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, support the people's revolutionary war, and sympathize with the elimination of the feudal system and the realization of land reform, whether in the past or present, are part of the Chinese national revolutionary united front. We express our condolences for the death of Mr. Li Dingming."

Li Liguo, the second son of Li Dingming, who worked in the Northeast Liberation Army Headquarters, sent a letter of condolence, saying: "In today's serious war, I cannot fulfill the ancient etiquette of 'attending the funeral' and the son's duty of 'escorting the coffin.' I can only faithfully implement your just will before your death: 'Completely agree with the Chinese Communist Party's complete elimination of feudalism, thorough distribution of land, and guarantee of the complete victory of the Chinese revolution.' I am a Communist Party member, and under the leadership of our Party, I will surely implement your will."
