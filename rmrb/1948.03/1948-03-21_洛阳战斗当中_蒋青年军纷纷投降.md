Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Yu, Shan, and E, 19th: Frontline reporter Liu Shouhua reports: In the Battle of Luoyang, Chiang's bandit Youth Army soldiers crossed the lines and surrendered to our side one after another. Guo Xinghua, a soldier from the First Regiment of the 206th Division, who was defending the northwest corner of the city, quietly crawled out of his bunker to our army's position to negotiate surrender, and was warmly welcomed by the People's Liberation Army soldiers. He immediately crawled back to his original position and led Du Heyuan, Xie Jianwen, and four others over. On this position alone, more than thirty young soldiers ran over that day. They were covered in mud, and one young soldier, who hadn't eaten for three days, recounted that he had escaped once last winter, but was unfortunately caught and severely beaten and confined. He said excitedly: "From now on, I will never be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek again." Also, in the battle of Zhougong Temple, Wang Rong, chairman of the soldiers' committee of a certain unit of the liberated fighters of Luohe, shouted to the Chiang bandit Youth Army guarding the cave, and forty-four soldiers came out to surrender at once.

　　洛阳战斗当中　蒋青年军纷纷投降
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十九日电】前线记者刘寿华报道：洛阳战斗中蒋匪青年军士兵，穿过火线纷纷向我投诚。据守该城西北角的二○六师第一团的士兵郭兴华，从碉堡里悄悄爬到我军阵地，接洽投诚，受到解放军战士们的热烈欢迎。他当即爬回原阵地把杜鹤远、谢建文等四个人领过来。在这个阵地上，这一天内就跑过来卅多个青年兵。他们满身都是污泥，一个三天没吃饭的青年兵叙述他在去冬曾逃跑过一次，不幸被捉回去遭毒打及禁闭，他很兴奋的说：“今后可再不给蒋介石当炮灰了”。又在周公庙战斗中，漯河解放战士某部士兵委员会主席王荣，到蒋匪青年军据守的地洞前喊话，一次有四十四个士兵出来投降。
