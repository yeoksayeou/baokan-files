　　Shahe, Lingchuan and Other Places Work Teams
　　Go Deep into Basic Units to Create Experience
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to news from PingShun, LiCheng, ChangZhi, ShaHe, LingChuan and other counties, their work teams (or squads) have begun to go deep into various basic units, visit and mobilize poor and hired peasants, and carry out land redistribution, rectification of the Party, and democratic movements. In the initial process of this mobilization, each area has different practices and experiences:
    The Dongluotuo work team in the fifth district of Licheng went to the village on the evening of the 28th of last month, abandoned the old village cadres and the original poor and hired peasant groups in the village, and directly found poor and hired peasant families to live with, first visiting honest peasants who had not participated in the poor and hired peasant groups. At the beginning of the conversation, they were afraid to speak freely and boldly, fearing that the cadres would retaliate after the work team left. After further mobilization, they learned some information and discovered that among the original 12 members of the poor and hired peasant group in the village, 4 were cadres, all of whom were designated by the political director and could follow the cadres' instructions. For example, Wang Baocai's five brothers, all single men, sometimes had to cook, and could not attend meetings on time, so they were labeled as "dead backward" and not allowed to join the group. They reflected that the cadres were like "Zhu Yuanzhang ascending the throne, forgetting the poor." The initial work experience is that it is necessary to start directly from mobilizing these honest poor and hired peasants.
    The Sanwang Village work team in the fourth district of Shahe arrived in the village on March 1. Several comrades knocked on doors to find poor and hired peasants. When they first went to a house, the people asked who they were and what they were doing. They couldn't say anything and said they had come to the wrong door. When they went to another house, the woman was spinning cotton. When asked who they were looking for, they again couldn't say anything and left. In this way, everyone felt that there was no way to find the poor and hired peasants, and they were extremely depressed. Later, they went to an old lady's house and heard from her dissatisfaction with the cadres and the situation of some households who had not yet turned over, and gradually connected and mobilized, initially opening up the situation.
    The land reform work team in the sixth district of Pingshun was divided into four groups, which went to Hongtigan, Hongni, Sitou, and Xishiziling respectively to create land reform experience. At the beginning, they also avoided the circles of the old cadre branches and directly went deep into the poor and hired peasants to visit and understand the situation. At the beginning, the poor and hired peasants did not dare to tell the truth. Family members restricted each other. Men did not allow women to speak, and some women did not allow men to speak, fearing trouble. Xu Deren, an old poor peasant in Hongtigan, said, "Is the problem of the village cadres really being solved? Or just explained away? If it is really being solved, we will speak." The poor and hired peasants in Xishiziling were afraid that the work team would leave, and did not understand how to do it, so they always left the words unfinished when they spoke: "You come again later and we will talk!" Fearing that it would not work and cause trouble. After repeated education and encouragement, they gradually approached and began to expose the real situation: the leadership of the village was controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and the instructor and the chairman of the peasant association were landlords. The chairman of the peasant association, the director of the cooperative, the secretary and other three people were members of the Kuomintang Three People's Principles Youth League who had infiltrated the Communist Party. They covered up each other and became sworn brothers. In the land reform, 19 households were struggled against, but none of them were landlords and rich peasants, but 12 were poor and hired peasants, and two were called "local tyrant middle peasants," and they were severely beaten in the struggle. Although other villages were not as serious as this village, there were similar situations. The landlords and rich peasants were not cleared economically, and they did not bow their heads politically. Some drilled into the branches, controlled the leadership, and oppressed the masses, and the poor and hired peasants did not turn over completely. In Sitou, three landlords and two rich peasants were not struggled against at all, but were given fruits of the revolution. Based on these situations, the work team directly went deep into the poor and hired peasants to mobilize. For example, Hongni has developed 54 people and established a poor peasant league, and also absorbed four better party members into the league, and is now gradually promoting it.
    The work team of Shilanggang Village, Pingcheng District, Lingchuan, reviewed the shortcomings in their initial work. First, they did not publicly publicize the land law, educate the poor and hired peasants, and unite the middle peasants. They only asked the poor and hired peasants to connect and establish a poor peasant league. The poor and hired peasants did not understand the policy and purpose, and were impatient, saying "Do it quickly, don't delay the planting of crops." The middle peasants did not understand either, and were afraid, not knowing whose land was being "equally divided". Another point was that they removed the political director, instructor, and civil affairs committee member and other three cadres without going through the poor and hired peasants, nor through internal criticism and struggle among the cadres, mainly because they were afraid that they would hinder themselves and prevent them from carrying out their work smoothly. In addition, in Nanluhe Village, 41 households were classified, and 14% of them were classified as landlords and rich peasants. For example, Zhang Lishun's family had eight mu of land and three people. He himself worked as a merchant, and sometimes hired short-term workers at home, and he himself also participated in attached labor, so he was classified as a rich peasant. After checking out these mistakes, the Pingcheng District work team is planning to correct them in the next stage of work.
    After arriving in the village, the Nancheng work team in the third district of Changzhi immediately held a branch meeting, announced the Land Law and the Letter to Party Members, and finally announced the cessation of activities, forbidding destruction, and waiting for mass review. That night, it held a mass meeting, openly expressed its attitude, dispelled some ideological concerns of the masses, and facilitated mobilization. Then, it divided the land into districts and went deep to visit the poor and hired peasants. At the beginning, it couldn't find them, or even found the homes of landlords and rich peasants. Later, it found a party member who was oppressed in the branch. He had sold his labor for three generations, and his five family members still shared two broken quilts. In the process of talking with him, he cried sadly. Through him, they learned about a dozen poor and hired peasants who had been working for many years but had not turned over. After individual visits and connections by the work team, 160 people were mobilized. Their experience is that on the one hand, they must show their attitude and go deep into visits and connections, be sincere and honest, so that the poor and hired peasants feel that they are their relatives; on the other hand, they must abandon the old cadres, so that the poor and hired peasants dare to approach us. In addition, good party members should also be clarified and absorbed.

    Editor's note:
    Judging from the reports of the work teams in Pingshun and other five counties, their methods and entry points into the villages are different. For example, the Dongluotuo work team in Licheng, the Sanwang Village work team in Shahe, and the Sitou work team in Pingshun all started by directly visiting the poor and hired peasants. Although they encountered some obstacles at the beginning, such as the poor peasants hesitating to speak and the comrades in the work team not being able to find the poor and hired peasants, they generally faced the most oppressed and unturned poor and hired peasants, and initially found the support for their work. Another method, such as the Nancheng Village work team in Changzhi, openly expressed their attitude as soon as they arrived in the village, and then went deep to visit and mobilize the poor and hired peasants, which also achieved great results. This shows that no matter what method is adopted, whether it is a secret visit at the beginning or first openly expressing the attitude and then going deep to mobilize, one thing is common and most important, that is, in this movement, rely on the backbone of the poor and hired peasants, thoroughly mobilize all honest and poor peasants, and make them thoroughly turn over economically and politically. However, in order to reduce the lengthy exploration at the beginning of the work, and reduce the concerns of some middle peasants, the practice of the Nancheng Village in Changzhi, first openly expressing the attitude and explaining the policy, and then immediately going deep to visit and mobilize the poor and hired peasants, seems to be more suitable.

　　沙河陵川等地工作组
  　深入基点创造经验
    【本报消息】据平顺、黎城、长治、沙河、陵川等县消息，他们的工作组（或队）已开始深入各基点，访问发动贫雇层，开展填补整党民主运动。在这初步发动的过程中，各地各有不同的作法和体验：
    黎城五区东骆驼工作组，上月二十八日晚到村把旧村干和村中原有的贫雇小组抛开，直接找到贫雇家住下，先访问未参加贫雇小组的老实农民。在开始谈话中，他们不敢放心大胆的谈，怕工作组走了干部报复。以后又深入动员，才了解些情况，发现村中原有的贫雇小组十二人就有干部四人，参加的都是政治主任指定的，都是能听干部指挥的，如王保才弟兄五人五个光棍，因家中没娘们，有时要做饭，开会不能按时到，就说是“死落后”，不叫参加小组；他们反映干部是“朱洪武登基，忘了穷人”。工作初步经验是必须直接从发动这些老实贫雇入手。
    沙河四区三王村工作组三月一日到村，几个同志挨门找贫雇，开始到一家，人家问是谁？干啥的？没法回答说是走错了门；又到一家，人家娘们在纺花，问找谁？又没好说的退出门来。这样大家感到没法找到贫雇，苦闷极了。后来串到一家老太太家，从她口中听到对干部的不满和一些没翻身户的情形，才逐渐串连发动，初步打开局面。
    平顺六区土改工作队分为四组，分别到虹梯关、虹霓、寺头、西十字岭创造土改经验，开始也是避开旧干部支部的圈圈，直接深入贫雇访问了解情况。开始贫雇不敢说实话，家中人互相限制，男人不叫女人说，有的女人不叫男人说，怕惹下事。虹梯关一个贫苦老汉许德仁说：“对村干部的问题是真解决呢？还是解释解释？要真解决，咱就说。”西十字岭贫雇怕工作组走，也不了解究竟如何作法，每次说话总不说完，留下话把说：“你以后来了咱再谈！”怕说了不顶事惹下祸。经再三教育启发撑腰，才逐渐接近，开始暴露真实情况：原来该村领导权被地主富农所掌握，指导员、农会主席都是地主；农会主席、合作社长、书记等三人，是混进共产党的国民党三青团员，他们互相包庇，拜成十大弟兄。土改中斗了十九户，其中没有地主富农，却有十二户贫雇，还有两户被称为“恶霸中农”，斗争中打的十分重。其他几村虽没这村严重，也有类似情况。地主富农经济上没清算，政治上没低头，有些钻进支部，把持领导权，欺压群众，贫雇没翻透身。寺头有三户地主、两户富农根本未斗反而分得果实。根据这些情况，工作组即直接深入发动贫雇，如虹霓已发展了五十四人，成立了贫农团，同时还吸收了四个较好的党员入团，现正在逐步推进中。
    陵川平城区侍郎岗村工作组，检讨他们初步工作中的毛病，一是没有公开宣传土地法，教育贫雇，团结中农，只叫贫雇串连成立贫农团，贫雇不了解政策和目的，急性，叫“快些弄吧，不要误了种地”。中农也不了解，害怕，不知平分是“平”谁的。再一点是没有通过贫雇，也没经干部内部的批评斗争，就把政治主任、指导员、民政委员等三个干部撤了职，主要是怕他阻碍自己，不能顺利进行工作。另外在南路河村四十一户划阶级就划出百分之十四的地主富农，如张李顺家有八亩地三口人，他本人作商，家中地有时请短工作，他自己还参加附带劳动，就把人家划成了富农。平城区工作组检查出这些错误后，正计划在下段工作中改正。
    长治三区南呈工作组到村后，当晚即召开支部会，宣布土地法与告党员书，最后宣布停止活动，不准破坏，等待群众审查；当夜又召开群众会，公开表明态度，解除群众一些思想顾虑，便利了发动。接着即划分地片深入访问贫雇，开始有找不到甚至找到了地主富农家，以后就找了一个在支部受压迫的党员，他三辈子出卖劳力，至今五口人共盖两条破被子，和他谈的过程中，他难过的哭起来，经他又谈出十几户长年劳动没翻透身的贫雇。又经工作组个别访问串连，这样以贫找贫以苦引苦，串连发动了一百六十余人。他们的经验是一方面要表明态度深入访问串连，诚恳老实，使贫雇感到是他们的亲人；另一方面要抛开旧干部，使贫雇敢于接近我们。另外对好党员也应弄清吸收过来。

    编者的话：
    据平顺等五县工作队的报导来看，他们到村的作法和入手点，各有不同，如黎城东骆驼、沙河三王村、平顺寺头等几个工作组，开始都是首先直接访问贫雇，虽然一开头也遇到些障碍，如贫农顾虑不敢说话、工作同志摸不着门找不到贫雇等，但一般都是面向最受压迫没翻透身的贫雇，开始找到了工作的依托。另一种如长治南呈村工作组，一到村即公开表明态度，接着即深入访问发动贫雇，也收到很大效果。这里说明不管是采取什么方法，开始暗访或先公开表明态度再深入发动，有一点是共同的也是最重要的，就是在这次运动里依靠贫雇骨干，把所有老实的贫苦农民彻底发动起来，使他们在经济上政治上彻底翻身。但为了减少开始工作时过长时间的摸索，和减少某些中农的疑虑，长治南呈村的做法，先公开表明态度讲明政策，紧接着即深入访问发动贫雇层，这样似乎更适宜些。
