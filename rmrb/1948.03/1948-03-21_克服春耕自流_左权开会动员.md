    Overcoming Spontaneous Spring Plowing: Zuoquan Holds Mobilization Meeting
    [Zuoquan News] This year's spring plowing has somewhat stalled, according to the situation in various districts. The main reasons are as follows: After the Land Law was issued, the explanation was not clear, and the masses were somewhat confused. Furthermore, the poor and hired peasants who have recently been emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated have only a few acres of land, and they have great difficulties with livestock and farm tools; some simply do not have them. Some cadres who occupied excessive gains are afraid and do not act themselves, nor do they lead the masses to rise up for production. The main strength of county and district leaders is focused on filling gaps, and they have not timely led the spring plowing work, forming a spontaneous flow of leadership. In light of these situations, the county convened a meeting of responsible comrades from various districts on March 6 to study how to solve the problems and quickly transition to spring plowing. It was decided that each village should universally convene mass production mobilization meetings, announce policies for all classes, correctly interpret the Land Law Outline, and the spring plowing instructions issued by the District Party Committee, so that the poor and middle peasants have a correct understanding of the policies, and do not wait and panic. Landlords should also be settled and made to engage in production labor. Cadres in Category One and Category Two villages should not be completely dismissed; they should be educated to lead well in production, reduce past mistakes, and not make mistakes on top of mistakes. The county will establish a spring plowing guidance committee, each district will have someone specifically leading production, and each village will rely on the poor and hired peasants to unite the middle peasants, organize a spring plowing committee, rectify mutual aid teams, reorganize voluntarily, and clear up outstanding wages from last year. Resolutely unite the middle peasants and do not harm their interests. Specific difficulties should be resolved with a focus; in areas lacking food, inspire class friendship, launch mutual aid and borrowing of food, and the county will allocate 100 shi of relief grain to focus on relieving disaster areas for spring plowing. It was also decided that loans should be focused on, and small loans should be used for large purposes, such as three or five families borrowing money together to buy livestock and farm tools.

    克服春耕自流　左权开会动员
    【左权消息】今年春耕，根据各区情况来看，都有些停顿，其原因主要有几点：土地法下来后，解释不清楚，群众思想有些混乱。再就是翻身时间短和翻身不彻底的贫雇，仅仅有几亩地，牲畜、农具都很困难，有的根本就没有。有些多占果实的干部害怕，自己不动弹，也不领导群众起来生产。县区领导的主要力量搞填补，把春耕工作没及时的去领导，形成领导的自流。根据这些情况，县里在三月六日，召开各区负责同志会议，研究怎样解决问题迅速转上春耕。决定各村普遍召开群众生产动员大会，宣布对各阶层政策，正确解释土地法大纲，和区党委颁布的春耕指示，使贫中农对政策有正确认识，不致等待和恐慌，对地主也要安置使他生产劳动。在一类二类村的干部，不能用一脚踢开的办法，要教育他们，在生产中好好领导，减轻过去过错，不要错上加错。县里要成立春耕指导委员会，各区要有人专门领导生产，各村要依靠贫雇团结中农，组织春耕委员会，整顿互助组，重新自愿组织，清理去年遗留工资。坚决团结中农，不能损害中农利益。对具体困难要有重点的解决，在粮食缺乏的地方，启发阶级友爱，发动互助互借粮食，县里并抽出一百石救济粮，有重点的救济灾区进行春耕。并决定贷款要有重点，实行零贷整用，如三家五家贷上款伙用买牲口、农具等。（保江、世民）
