Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: London dispatch: The protest movement against the Attlee government's wage freeze is sweeping across Britain. The General Council of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC), under the instruction of the Labour government, passed a resolution the week before last expressing support for the government's plan to freeze wages at their current level. This resolution, which betrays the interests of the working class, was immediately met with protests from a significant portion of the unions participating in the TUC. According to the "Daily Worker", approximately 4.5 million organized workers are insisting on wage increases. These include: the London Transport Workers Union (56,000 members), the Gas Industry Workers Union (100,000 members), the Southern District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, cooperative workers (250,000), agricultural workers, the Executive Committee of the Scottish branch of the National Union of Mineworkers, electrical workers, engineers, shipbuilders, foundry workers, railway workers, and bank employees. Representatives of the Electrical Trades Union declared: "We do not intend to be fooled by Attlee." The National Union of Bank Employees Executive Committee is seeking a 15% pay increase, and 600,000 agricultural workers are firmly demanding an increase of ten shillings (equivalent to two US dollars) per week. Arthur Horner, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, agreed with the miners' wage increase demands. On the 17th, while speaking at a meeting organized by the Communist Party of Great Britain's London organization, he criticized the wage freeze policy, saying: At this critical juncture of the British economy, the first priority should be to strike at profits and extravagance, and not at wages.
