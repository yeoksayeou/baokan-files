Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, March 23rd: A delayed dispatch from our branch reporter describes the miserable state of Chiang Kai-shek's 60th Army as they fled Jilin: On the 8th of this month, the bandit chief Zheng Dongguo flew to Jilin with Chiang's orders and immediately convened a meeting of high-ranking bandit military officers, announcing that they would withdraw from the city at 12 o'clock that night. However, they deceived their soldiers by saying it was a "military transfer." The soldiers had already suspected something and prepared to escape on their own. As soon as the "transfer order" was issued, many of them threw away their weapons and ran into the streets, scrambling to exchange for civilian clothes. Some even took the opportunity to loot. The whole city was in chaos, with people and horses screaming. It was not until dawn that they managed to gather the scattered troops and pull them out of the city. At first, there was still a semblance of marching order, but after traveling not far, panic spread, and they scrambled for shortcuts, rushing along the narrow road by the Chacha River. Cars, carts, and livestock became a chaotic mess, with backpacks, coats, and valuables scattered all over the road. Zeng Zesheng, the commander of the 60th Army, originally rode in a car, but later, as the pursuing troops approached, he feared becoming a target and had to abandon the car and flee on foot. One of our reconnaissance personnel infiltrated the ranks of Chiang's bandits and followed them for reconnaissance without being discovered. The fleeing bandits were intercepted by our pursuing troops. After a brief engagement, more than 3,000 of them were captured. On the night the Chiang bandits withdrew from Jilin, the "resident members" of the puppet provincial assembly and other high-ranking members of the bandit gang were awakened from their dreams. Discovering that the "60th Army had run away," they chased after them without even dressing properly. Some who were a little slower fell behind. Account books, miscellaneous items, and high heels were scattered all over the puppet assembly hall. The "safe" containing counterfeit currency remained untouched. Not long after the bandits fled, many were captured in groups by the People's Liberation Army. Hu Tiyun, the former head of the puppet education department, was also captured by our army. When the Chiang bandits withdrew, they left behind a large number of weapons and ammunition. Three million rounds of ammunition that had just been delivered were not taken away. After the city was liberated for a week, our reporter toured the area and found American-made M, T, A.0360 red and black headed bullets and tracer bullets everywhere. In the past two days, citizens have picked up and handed over more than 400 guns to our army. According to military statistics, in addition to the ammunition already collected, it is estimated that more than 10 million rounds of various bullets and more than 100,000 artillery shells can still be found in the city.

　　蒋匪逃出吉林时狼狈惨状
    【新华社东北二十三日电】迟到消息：分社记者报导蒋匪六十军逃出吉林的狼狈情状称：本月八日匪首郑洞国带着蒋贼的命令飞到吉林，立即召集匪军高级军官开会，宣布于当晚十二时撤离该市。但对其士兵却欺骗说是“移防”。士兵们早已心里有底，也各自准备乘机逃跑。及至“移防令”一下，就有很多人把武器扔掉，跑往街上，抢换便衣，有的更趁机施行抢劫，顿时全城人喊马嘶，秩序大乱，直至天将发亮才好容易将七零八落的队伍集中起来，拉出城外。开始时尚有行军序列，但行进没有多远，即风声鹤唳，互相争走捷径，沿着岔路河的狭窄公路上乱窜，于是汽车、大车、牲口混成一团，背包、大衣、细软扔了满路。六十军军长曾泽生，原来乘坐汽车，后来因追兵已近，怕成为目标，只好丢下汽车，徒步逃跑。我军某侦察员曾混入蒋匪行列，跟随侦察，一直未被发觉。逃匪被我追击部队截击，稍一接触，即生俘其三千余名。当蒋匪撤出吉林的夜晚，伪省参议会的“驻会委员”及其他匪帮高级人员，从梦里被吵醒，发觉“六十军已经跑了”，连衣服也未穿好，拔腿就追，有的稍迟一步，就掉了队。伪参议会里的帐本、杂物、高跟鞋等掉落满地，“保险柜”中的伪钞原封未动。匪徒们逃出不久，就有很多被解放军成群抓了回来，前伪教育厅长胡体云也被我军捉回。蒋匪撤退时丢下大批的武器弹药，刚刚运到的三百万发子弹，一粒也未带走。该市解放一周，记者巡礼各地，仍随处可见美造Ｍ、Ｔ、Ａ·○三六○型的红黑头子弹与泄光弹。过去两天内市民拾得枪支送交我军者即达四百余支。据军方统计：除已搜集的弹药外，市内尚可继续搜获各种子弹千余万发，炮弹十余万发。
