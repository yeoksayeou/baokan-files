Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: Shanghai report: Following successive victories by the People's Liberation Army on various fronts, the Shanghai financial market is becoming increasingly chaotic. The Chiang currency is plummeting, breaking new records. On the 18th, the black market exchange rate for the US dollar surged from 490,000 yuan on the 17th to 520,000 yuan, and on the 19th, it further rose to 540,000 yuan, more than one and a half times higher than the peak of 220,000 yuan during the first economic storm in the Chiang area in January of this year. The price of gold rose by 3 million yuan per tael in a single day on the 18th, reaching 31 million yuan, and further increased to 32.5 million yuan on the 19th. Black market interest rates hit a post-war high, reaching a monthly rate of four percent. This indicates that the second economic storm in the Chiang area is continuing to intensify.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th: Since January of this year, when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits implemented the so-called "salary based on cost of living index" method, the official cost of living index stipulated by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits has lagged far behind prices, and prices continue to skyrocket. The cost of living index is "adjusted" only once every three months. As a result, the actual income of general public school teachers and staff in the Chiang area is not only far lower than before the civil war, but also significantly less than before the implementation of the cost of living index salary system. Taking Shanghai as an example, prices had already risen to 145,000 times pre-war levels in December of last year, and further increased to more than 400,000 times in March of this year. However, the salary index stipulated by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits for January, February, and March of this year was only 85,000 times. According to Chiang Kai-shek's calculation method, an employee with a base salary of 50 yuan receives a monthly income calculated as follows: the portion within 30 yuan is paid according to the cost of living index, totaling 2.55 million yuan; the remaining 20 yuan is paid at one-tenth of the index, totaling 170,000 yuan, for a total of 2.72 million yuan. However, before the adjustment, the income was the salary of 1.19 million yuan, a subsidy of 1.03 million yuan for the difference in the price of five dou of rice, oil, coal, sugar, and salt, a subsidy of approximately 250,000 yuan for the difference in the price of cloth, and a surplus of approximately 500,000 yuan in living allowances, for a total of approximately 2.97 million yuan. After the adjustment, it is actually reduced by 250,000 yuan. According to this calculation, those with a base salary of 60 yuan have their income reduced by 205,000 yuan; those with 70 yuan, reduced by 160,000 yuan; those with 80 yuan, reduced by 115,000 yuan; those with 90 yuan, reduced by 70,000 yuan; and those with 100 yuan, reduced by 25,000 yuan. As the Chiang currency continues to depreciate, their actual income decreases even more. An employee at the 50 yuan level can only afford to buy 60 jin of rice with their entire monthly income, which is actually insufficient to maintain a living. However, the income of high-ranking officials of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits with base salaries of 200 yuan or more has increased compared to before. For example, those with 200 yuan have their income increased by 425,000 yuan; those with 800 yuan have it increased by 3.125 million yuan. It can be seen that the income of the vast majority of middle and lower-level employees in the Chiang area, numbering in the millions, has decreased more and more due to the cost of living index salary system. Although each person is allocated three dou of rice per month, it is not even enough for a family of several people to eat thin porridge. They must purchase rice at a high price of more than 4 million yuan, and the remaining amount is simply insufficient to cover a large pile of expenses such as coal, oil, salt, rent, and clothing. In addition, the cost of living index is adjusted only once every three months, which is even slower than the skyrocketing prices.

      蒋区币值暴跌再破新纪录
   　公教人员生活极艰难
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】沪讯：各线人民解放军连获胜利之后，上海金融市场益趋混乱，蒋币暴跌，再度突破新纪录。十八日黑市美元汇价已由十七日的四十九万元暴涨至五十二万元，十九日更涨至五十四万，较今年一月蒋区第一次经济风暴的最高峰二十二万，已高出一倍半强。黄金在十八日一天之内每两涨价三百万元，而达三千一百万元，十九日再涨为三千二百五十万元。黑市利率则创抗战胜利后最高纪录，月息高达四分。显示蒋区二次经济风暴正继续加剧中。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】蒋匪自本年一月份起实行所谓“按生活指数发薪”办法后，由于蒋匪官定生活指数远落物价之后，且物价继续飞涨，生活指数须三个月才“调整”一次，结果蒋区一般公教人员实际收入不但远低于内战前，而且较按指数发薪前的收入亦已大为减少。以上海为例，去年十二月份物价已涨至战前十四万五千倍，今年三月份更涨达四十万倍以上，但蒋匪规定的今年一、二、三月份的发薪指数仅为八万五千倍，按照蒋匪计算办法，一个五十元底薪的职员，每月收入：三十元以内照生活指数发给计为二百五十五万元，超过三十元之二十元余数照指数十分之一发给，计为十七万元，共计二百七十二万元。但未调整之前收入为薪额一百一十九万元，五斗米、油、煤、糖、盐差额补助一百零三万元，布差额补助约二十五万元，生活补助费节余约五十万元，共约二百九十七万元。调整之后倒反少掉二十五万元。接此计算，六十元底薪者减少二十万五千元；七十元者减十六万元；八十元者减十一万五千元；九十元者减七万元；百元者减二万五千元。因蒋币不断贬值，他们的实际收入减少更多，一个五十元级的职员，全月收入仅足买米六十斤，实际上已不能维持生活。但底薪在二百元以上之蒋匪高级官员收入却较以前增加，例如二百元者增加四十二万五千元；八百元者增三百一十二万五千元。可见占绝大多数为数以百万计的蒋区中下级职员的收入已因按指数发薪较前越减越少，虽然每人每月配给食米三斗，可是数口之家连吃稀饭也不够，必需以四百多万元之高价购进食米，所余之数无论如何不足维持煤、油、盐、房租、衣服一大堆的支出，加之生活指数每三月调整一次，更跟不上发了疯的物价。
