Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th. Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the China Labor Association, issued a declaration in London on January 9 this year regarding the current situation, calling on workers in the KMT-controlled areas to strengthen the anti-Chiang and anti-American struggle. The declaration began by stating: "Every worker who grows up in the Kuomintang-controlled area suffers the cruel oppression of the Chiang regime's secret agents and the ruthless trampling of American imperialism. Our lives are deeply plunged into the abyss of hunger, cold, and terror. We workers can no longer endure this situation. The Chiang Kai-shek regime, due to successive military and economic failures and facing the crisis of final collapse, does not hesitate to strengthen its traitorous, civil war dictatorship, dissolving the Democratic League, destroying the democratic movement, and arresting and killing large numbers of workers, peasants, young people, and masses at home; and accepting the Wedemeyer Plan and selling military fortresses, selling Chinese sovereignty to American imperialism abroad." The declaration then pointed out: "Due to the increasing strength of the Chinese people, we firmly believe that the Chiang regime will surely collapse in the near future, and the conspiracy of American imperialism to colonize China will surely fail. In the current situation, as long as we dare to struggle, the bright future of our workers can certainly be achieved." Zhu's declaration concluded with the utmost enthusiasm, calling on workers across the country to take effective action: 1. Support the democratic revolution to eliminate the Chiang regime; 2. Support and assist farmers across the country in implementing land reform and completely abolish the feudal system; 3. Support all political forces fighting for democracy to create a patriotic united front of the Chinese people; 4. Oppose the Wedemeyer Plan and the Marshall Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, and Liu Ningyi, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the Liberated Areas, who attended the World Federation of Trade Unions, sent a letter from London to Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Paris on January 12 this year, on behalf of the China Labor Association, submitting a proposal from the China Labor Association opposing the discussion of the Marshall Plan at the upcoming meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The proposal first pointed out that since the surrender of Japan, American imperialism has provided extremely large assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's anti-popular civil war in terms of loans, materials, and military equipment training, while American imperialism has obtained privileges in China's military, political, and economic aspects from Chiang Kai-shek. The Wedemeyer Proposal includes interfering in China from the three aspects of politics, military affairs, and economy, in an attempt to preserve Chiang's crumbling rule. The US government and the Chiang Kai-shek regime have jointly deprived the Chinese people of their right to life. Many Chinese workers, peasants, and young people have become victims of American policy. The proposal then pointed out: "American interference in China cannot but encounter the most powerful opposition from the Chinese people. Any further assistance to Chiang Kai-shek cannot turn the tide of the war in his favor, let alone conquer China. It only prolongs the suffering of the Chinese people. Therefore, we, on behalf of the China Labor Association, suggest that the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions take action against the Wedemeyer Proposal and the Marshall Plan. This proposal and plan are contrary to the spirit of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which aims to oppose war and the causes of war, and aims to strive for a consolidated and lasting peace. We further suggest that the World Federation of Trade Unions take effective measures to immediately stop these plans that exploit Chinese workers and bring destruction to workers in other countries."

　　朱学范氏号召蒋管区工人
  　加强反蒋反美斗争
    指出敢于斗争就有光明前途
    【新华社东北十二日电】世界工联副主席、中国劳动协会理事长朱学范，于今年一月九日在伦敦发表其个人对于目前时局的宣言，号召蒋区工人加强反蒋反美斗争。宣言首称：“我们生长在国民党区的每一个工人，都遭受着蒋政权的特务残酷压迫和美帝国主义的无情蹂躏，我们的生活深深的陷入饥寒恐怖的深渊。这种情况，我们工人再也不能忍受下去。蒋介石政权由于军事及经济着着失败，面临最后崩溃的危机，竟不惜加强他卖国内战独裁的统治，对内解散民主同盟，摧毁民主运动，大批逮捕与杀害工农青年群众，对外接受魏德迈计划，出卖军事要塞，出卖中国主权与美帝国主义。”宣言继指出：“由于中国人民力量日益强大，我们深信蒋政权在不久将来一定崩溃，美帝国主义殖民地化中国的阴谋一定失败。处在目前时局中，只要我们敢于斗争，我们工人的光明前途一定能够达到。”朱氏宣言最后以万分热忱号召全国工人采取有效的行动：一、拥护消灭蒋政权的民主革命运动；二、拥护及帮助全国农民实行土地改革，彻底废除封建制度；三、拥护一切为民主而奋斗的政治力量，来造成中国人民的爱国统一战线；四、反对魏德迈计划及马歇尔计划。
    【新华社东北十二日电】出席世界工联的中国劳动协会理事长朱学范、中国解放区职工联合会总会筹备会主任刘宁一，代表中国劳协于今年一月十二日自伦敦致函巴黎世界工联总书记赛南，提出中国劳协反对在行将到来的世界工联执行局会议中讨论马歇尔计划的提案书。该提案书首先指出自日本投降以来，美帝国主义已在贷款、物资及军队装备训练等方面，对蒋介石反人民内战作了极其巨大的援助，而美帝国主义则从蒋介石手中获得了中国的军事、政治及经济各方面的特权。魏德迈建议包括从政治、军事、经济三方面干涉中国，图谋保留蒋的摇摇欲坠的统治，美国政府与蒋介石政权合力剥夺了中国人民生活的权利，许多的中国工人农民及青年已成为美国政策的牺牲者。提案书接着指出：“美国对中国的干涉，不能不遇到中国人民的最有力的反对，任何对蒋介石的进一步援助，都不能把战局转为对他有利，更谈不到征服中国，它唯有延长中国人民的苦难。因此我们代表中国劳协，建议世界职工联盟执行局，采取反对魏德迈建议与马歇尔计划的行动，这种建议与计划，是与旨在反对战争及战争的原因，旨在争取巩固与持久的和平的世职机构的精神相抵触的。我们进一步建议由世职采取有效措施，立即制止这些压榨中国工人和给其他国家工人带来毁灭的计划”。
