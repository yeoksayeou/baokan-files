Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: According to news from Hong Kong on the 17th, US imperialism is actively expanding its aggression in South China. Several American coal mine and railway transportation experts have arrived in Guangzhou. The American trust "Jiangnan Construction Company" has sent its directors and engineers to Fuzhou to invest in and monopolize the province's hydroelectric stations, paper mills, and other enterprises. The American Penny Lee Company has decided to first open glass factories, steel mills, and tin and coal mines in Guangdong. Xie Jiarong, director of the surveying department of the Chiang Kai-shek Resources Committee, is leading a surveying team in Hexian, Babu, and Zhongshan in eastern Guangxi to survey important military resources such as tungsten, tin, oil, and uranium mines, in order to sell them to the United States. The tungsten mines in eastern Guangxi account for seventy to eighty percent of the country's annual output, about half of the world's output. In the past few years, the United States has seized this mineral resource through loans. In addition, in order to strengthen the connection between South China and Taiwan under its control, the US has recently instructed Song Ziwen to instigate the organization of a "Taiwan Inspection Group" from the five provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Jiangxi. The group arrived in Hong Kong from Guangdong on the 17th and will soon go to Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: According to news from Nanjing on the 15th, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government, in order to facilitate the further strengthening of the Chennault Air Transport Group's aggression against China, has, with the "approval" of the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan, nominally changed the team's name to the Chiang Kai-shek "Ministry of Transportation Civil Aviation Administration Directly Subordinated Air Transport Team." The Chiang Kai-shek Civil Aviation Administration has been ordered to sign a contract with the American imperialist bandit Chennault. The contract stipulates that the air transport base will be temporarily set up at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport and will be moved to Hankou after the Hankou Airport is completed. In addition to operating "irregular passenger, freight, and mail transportation services," the team can also open "regular routes." If the team needs to use "other airports" other than those "designated" by Chiang Kai-shek, it can "apply for approval from the Civil Aviation Administration" at any time, and can also borrow "military airports" when necessary. Chiang Kai-shek confirmed that Chennault and the team's deputy manager, Weilaor, are the "co-owners" of the air transport team and its equipment assets, "and represent other partners," and they are "responsible for management." Chiang Kai-shek will not interfere with "all external finances" of the team. The contract stipulates that the team can provide Chiang Kai-shek with "emergency transportation and military use" to directly assist Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. A dispatch from the United Press in Nanjing on the 15th revealed that the reorganization of the Chennault Air Transport Group is to strengthen air aggression routes in China "especially to various border provinces."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: The American imperialist Chennault Air Transport Group, due to Chen's special relationship with Soong Mei-ling, enjoys various privileges under the generous special permission of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government, and uses the Chinese civil war to suck the blood of the Chinese people to get rich. This is the secret of why Chennault frantically advocates aggression against China and aids Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people regardless of the consequences. According to the Chiang Party's Peiping World Daily on the 8th of last month: "Among foreigners who come to China and use various personal connections to make a fortune in China, Chennault is undoubtedly the most prominent recently." It is said that Chennault enjoys the following privileges: First, Shanghai Hongqiao Airport was originally an airport for the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force, and ordinary civil aviation aircraft cannot use it, but the team can use it; second, Chiang Kai-shek prohibits airline night flights, but has no right to prohibit Chennault's Air Transport Team, so the team can fly day and night, so its transportation capacity is twice its capacity; third, the team obtains more Chiang Kai-shek official exchange rates than other Chiang Kai-shek airlines; fourth, the team used the name of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to purchase aircraft gasoline and exempt customs duties, and the team's business was granted tax exemption privileges. According to another report, the team also combined with the "China-America Industrial Company" to monopolize commercial transportation. It is said that the company is jointly run by Chennault and Soong Mei-ling and other bureaucratic capitalists.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: US imperialism, in "cooperation" with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, has seized and completely controlled Taiwan's sugar industry. According to the Peiping World Daily, which is related to Chiang Kai-shek's officials, the Chiang Kai-shek Taiwan Sugar Company has six American "consultants" who "took office" in September last year. All business of the company is actually controlled by them, and a new plan of aggression called a five million US dollar "loan" is being "drafted" recently. The "1948 Aid to China (Chiang) Plan" to colonize China, issued by the US State Department at the end of last month, also stipulates the so-called "assistance" for invading the Taiwan sugar industry.

      美帝扩展对华南侵略
   　蒋匪协助到处设厂勘测矿藏
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据香港十七日消息：美帝国主义正积极扩展其对华南的侵略。美籍煤矿及铁道运输专家多人，已到达广州，美国托辣斯“江南建设公司”已派其董事及工程师多人前往福州，准备投资垄断该省水力站、造纸厂及其他企业。美帝潘尼李公司已决定首先在粤开办玻璃厂、钢厂及锡、煤矿业等。蒋匪资委会勘测处长谢家荣所率领之测量队，正在桂东贺县八步及钟山一带勘测钨、锡、石油及铀矿等重要军事资源，以便出卖给美国。桂东钨矿占全国每年产量十分之七八，约占全世界产量一半，过去数年中美国即曾以贷款方式夺得该项矿产。此外，美帝为加强华南与其控制下的台湾的联系，最近授意宋匪子文策动组织粤桂闽湘赣五省“台湾考察团”。该团已于十七日由粤抵港，即将赴台。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据南京十五日消息：蒋匪卖国政府为便于美帝陈纳德空运大队进一步加强其侵华活动，已经蒋匪行政院“核准”将该队名义上改为蒋匪“交通部民航局直辖空运队”。蒋匪民航局已受命与美帝侵华匪徒陈纳德订立合同，合同规定：空运基地暂设上海虹桥机场，俟汉口机场完成后再迁汉口。该队除可经营“不定期客货邮件运输业务”外，并可开办“定期航线”，该队如需用蒋匪“指定”以外之“其他机场”，可随时“申请民航局核准”，必要时并可借用“军用机场”。蒋匪确认陈纳德与该队副经理魏劳尔为空运队及该队器材资产之“共同所有人，并为其他合伙者之代表”，由彼等自行“负责管理”，该队“一切对外财务”蒋匪一概不予过问。合同规定该队为直接协助蒋匪内战，得为蒋匪“作紧急运输及军用”。美帝合众社南京十五日电讯透露：陈纳德空运大队的改组，是为了加强在中国各地“特别是到各边疆省份”的空中侵华航线。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】美帝陈纳德空运大队由于陈与宋美龄有特别关系，在蒋匪卖国政府优厚特许下，享有种种特权，并利用中国内战，向中国人民吸血致富。这就是陈纳德之所以疯狂主张侵略中国与不顾一切后果地援助蒋介石屠杀中国人民的秘密。据上月八日蒋党北平世界日报透露：“外国人来华，利用种种人事关系，大发其中国财者，最近当推陈纳德首屈一指。”据称，陈纳德享有如下特权：第一、上海虹桥机场原为蒋匪空军机场，一般民航机均不能利用，该队则可利用；第二、蒋匪禁止航空公司夜航，但对陈纳德空运队则无权禁止，该队日夜均可飞行，因此其运载客货高出其能力一倍；第三、该队所获蒋匪牌价外汇较其他蒋匪航空公司还多；第四、该队曾利用行总名义，购买飞机汽油，免纳关税，而且该队营业曾获得免税特权。据另息，该队并与“中美实业公司”结合一起，垄断商运。据该公司为陈纳德与宋美龄等官僚资本合办。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】美帝国主义在蒋家匪帮“合作”下，已攫取和全部控制台湾糖业。据与蒋匪官方有关之北平世界日报近透露：蒋匪台糖公司，已有美籍“顾问”六人，于去年九月“到职”。该公司全部业务已实际为其所控制，近并正“草拟”所谓五百万美元“借款”的新的侵略计划。上月下旬美国务院发表的殖民地化中国之“一九四八年援华（蒋）方案”中，亦规定侵略台湾糖业的所谓“资助”。
