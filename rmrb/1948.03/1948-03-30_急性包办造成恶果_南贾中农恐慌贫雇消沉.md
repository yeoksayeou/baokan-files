(Taixing News) The Wenxian Office, in order to promptly correct the leftist errors of the South Jia Land Reform Work Group in the Second District, which were caused by the hasty, commanding, and interfering work style that divorced them from the masses, issued a special notice to the entire county on March 17th. The notice first pointed out that the South Jia Work Group, due to not completely shaking off the old ways, only saw the sixty-plus poor and hired laborers who had been mobilized after the initial mobilization of the poor and hired, and neglected the mobilization of the entire poor and hired class and the middle peasant class. They felt that this small-scale approach was not enough and wanted to act quickly to carry out the struggle and eliminate feudalism. Supported by the simple view that "poor and hired laborers are easy to find, but their minds are difficult to mobilize," they adopted the method of administrative orders and complete takeover. They simply selected several group leaders and large group leaders (i.e., fruit preservation group leaders) at the poor and hired laborers' meeting, and the work group personally led militia cadres, etc., to register feudal property. In two and a half days, they registered more than thirty households and also turned up some grain, clothing, etc., from the landlords, preparing for struggle. As a result, it caused panic and unease among the middle peasants, and the poor and hired laborers also became afraid due to the lack of ideological mobilization or insufficient mobilization, showing retreat and hindering the work greatly. The notice then pointed out: This kind of administrative order and complete takeover thinking and style is very wrong. The danger of this kind of thinking lies in ignoring the line of mobilizing the entire poor and hired class, relying on the poor and hired, and firmly uniting with the middle peasants to eliminate feudalism. Doing so will inevitably prevent the poor and hired from being mobilized, and feudalism cannot be eliminated. It continued, "In the future, we should continue to go deep into individual poor and hired laborers and groups, combine group meetings with deliberation and discussion, and use large-scale propaganda and education to carry out ideological mobilization. Only by mobilizing a large number of poor and hired middle peasants can we carry out the struggle to eliminate feudalism." The notice finally especially hoped that the comrades of the South Jia Work Group in the Second District would conduct in-depth research and correction, and also hoped that the comrades of the land reform work groups in each district would pay attention to avoid repeating this kind of error.

　　急性包办造成恶果
  　南贾中农恐慌贫雇消沉
    【太行消息】温县办公室为及时纠正二区南贾土改工作组、由于急性命令包办作风所造成的脱离群众的左倾错误，于三月十七日特通报全县。通报中首先指出：南贾工作组由于没有完全摆脱老一套作风，在贫雇初步发动后，领导干部只看到了已发动的六十多个贫雇，而忽视了整个贫雇阶层与中农层的发动，感到这种小手小脚不中（不行），要很快行动起来，急于进行斗争消灭封建。并在“贫雇好找、思想难发动”的单纯任务观点支持下，采用了行政命令、包办代替的方法，在贫雇会上简单选了几个小组长与大组长（即保管果实组长），由工作组亲自带领民兵干部等，即进行登记封建财产，在两天半时间内，登记了三十余户，还弄出地主若干粮食、衣服等，准备斗争。结果引起了中农恐慌不安，贫雇也由于思想未发动、或发动的不充分而害怕起来，表现了退缩不前，使工作受到极大损失。该通报随即指出：这种行政命令包办代替的思想与作风是非常错误的，这种思想的危险性，就在于忽视了发动整个贫雇阶层、依靠贫雇、巩固的联合中农来消灭封建这条路线，这样做必然使贫雇发动不起来，封建也消灭不了。继指出：“今后还是应该继续深入个别贫雇及小组，结合小组会的酝酿讨论，大会的宣传教育来进行思想发动，只有发动起大量的贫雇中农，才能进行消灭封建的斗争”。通报最后特别希望二区南贾工作组同志要加以深刻研究纠正，并希各区土改工作组同志，亦加以注意，避免这种错误的重复。
