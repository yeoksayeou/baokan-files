Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 27th: Moscow dispatch: The mining team led by Heihbin Kov, a miner from the Donets Coal Mine, recently broke the highest record of 669 tons of coal extracted per shift set by the Torrenkov team on February 24th, with a new record of 918 tons of coal extracted per shift. This exceeds the record of 426 tons set by the Torrenkov team on February 13th by more than twice, and the latter had already exceeded the per-shift production quota by more than 40 times at that time. This miraculous achievement is a new symbol of the unprecedented upsurge in socialist labor emulation among miners. "Breaking old records and creating new records" has become the goal of every miner's competition. The Troyan team of miners in Krivoy Rog, which is now challenging Torrenkov, has created the city's highest coal mining record by combining a new invention that won the Stalin Prize with the working methods of Stakhanovite worker Mitrovanov. The team's coal production will exceed this year's annual plan by two times by the end of April. The Soviet Union, whose degree of mechanization has long been the world's first, is also vigorously strengthening the degree of mechanization of coal mines in order to increase production. It has now exceeded the pre-war level, and electric locomotives, conveyor belts, coal mining and loading machines, and powerful electric coal mining machines capable of mining one million tons of coal per year are widely used in various mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 27th: Moscow dispatch: News of the completion of the March plans by industries throughout the Soviet Union is coming in like snowflakes. At the beginning of this month, thousands of factories and mines across the Soviet Union had completed their plans. More than 250 factories in Leningrad and more than 100 factories in Moscow had completed their plans as early as March 12th. Workers have all been swept into the upsurge of socialist labor emulation, and many workers have even put forward a new slogan: "Strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in three and a half years." Kozlov, a demobilized soldier working at the Nogin Textile Factory in Leningrad, was the first to complete his personal Five-Year Plan on March 18th. Steelworkers in the Rostov Oblast have now exceeded the level of rolled steel production in the last year of the Five-Year Plan. In the Urals, 15,000 Stakhanovite workers have exceeded their individual daily production plans by two to three times. Workers are realizing their promises with ever-increasing enthusiasm and confidence.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: Moscow dispatch: While the American reactionaries are frantically carrying out war deception propaganda, the Soviet Union is still vigorously engaged in peaceful construction and spring plowing. According to a TASS dispatch on the 16th, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has decided to complete the demobilization of older soldiers by the end of this month. As a result of the demobilization, the vast majority of soldiers continuing to serve will be limited to those born in 1926 and 1927. At the same time, a nationwide spring plowing competition is being widely launched throughout the Soviet Union. Farmers in Ukraine, the granary of the Soviet Union, are determined to seize new achievements on the front line of peaceful labor this year. Twenty-eight thousand collective farms and one thousand two hundred and forty machine tractor stations in Ukraine wrote to Stalin and said, "We will work with an attitude worthy of Soviet patriots." They promised: This year, the cultivated area will be expanded by 2.5 million hectares (equivalent to 40 million mu) compared with last year. Farmers in the Altai region, the initiators of the national agricultural competition, vowed to increase the spring sowing area by 616,000 hectares (equivalent to 9.856 million mu). Sowing has now begun in southern Soviet Union, and tractors have cultivated more than one million hectares (equivalent to 16 million mu), which is three times that of the same period last year. At present, spring crops have been sown on 500,000 hectares (equivalent to 8 million mu) of cultivated land nationwide.

　　全苏开展和平建设生产竞赛
  　矿工组日采煤九百余吨           
   “争取三年半完成五年计划”
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】莫斯科讯：顿尼兹煤矿工人希赫宾可夫所率领的矿工小组，顷以在每班时间采煤九百一十八吨的新纪录，打破托伦科夫组在上月二十四日所创每班采煤六百六十九吨的最高纪录。超过托伦科夫组在上月十三日所创四百二十六吨的纪录两倍有余，而后者当时已超过每班生产定量四十多倍。这种奇迹性的成绩，是矿工们社会主义竞赛空前高涨的新标帜。“打破旧纪录，创造新纪录”，已成为每一个矿工竞争的目标。现在向托伦科夫提出挑战的克里罗伏格矿工特洛扬组，因结合荣获斯大林奖金的某种新发明与斯塔哈诺夫工人米特罗瓦诺夫的工作方法，创造了该城采煤最高纪录。该组产煤量到四月底将超过今年全年计划两倍。机械化程度早就是世界第一的苏联，为了增加生产，煤矿机械化程度也正大力加强，现已超过战前水平，各矿已普遍应用电动机车、传送带、采煤装车两用机和每年能采煤一百万吨的强力电动挖煤机。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联各地工业完成三月份计划的消息，有如雪片传来，本月初全苏完成计划的工厂矿场已有好几千，列宁格勒有二百五十多个、莫斯科有一百多个工厂在三月十二日即已完成计划。工人们已全部卷入社会主义竞赛的热潮中，许多工人甚至提出了新的口号：“争取三年半完成五年计划”。列宁格勒诺金纺织工厂工人复员军人科佐已在三月十八第一个完成了他个人的五年计划。罗斯托夫州钢铁工人现在已超过五年计划最后一年的辗钢生产水平。乌拉尔有一万五千个斯塔汉诺夫工人已超过个人每日生产计划两倍到三倍。工人们正以日益增长的热诚与信心，实现自己的诺言。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：当美国反动派疯狂进行战争欺骗宣传之时，苏联仍大力从事和平建设和春耕。据塔斯社十六日电，最高苏维埃主席团决定本月底将完成较年长的士兵之复员工作。复员结果，继续服役的士兵，绝大部分将只限于一九二六年生和一九二七年生的两级。同时，全苏现正广泛展开全国性的春耕大竞赛。苏联谷仓的乌克兰的农民，坚决要在今年的和平劳动阵线上夺取新的成就。乌克兰二万八千个集体农场和一千二百四十个机器拖拉机站，写信给斯大林说：“将以称得上是苏联爱国者的态度来工作”。他们承诺：今年比去年将扩大耕地面积二百五十万公顷（合四千万亩）。全国农业大赛竞的发起者阿尔泰区农民誓言要增加春耕面积六十一万六千公顷（合九百八十五万六千亩）。苏联南部现已开始播种，拖拉机已耕地一百万公顷（合一千六百万亩）以上，为去年同期的三倍。目前全国已有五十万公顷（合八百万亩）耕地播种了春季作物。
