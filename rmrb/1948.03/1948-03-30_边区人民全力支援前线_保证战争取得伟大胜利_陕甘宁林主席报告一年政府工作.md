Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th: Chairman Lin of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government, at an enlarged joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the Border Region Council and government members held at the end of February, reported on "One Year of Government Work in the Revolutionary War." Chairman Lin first pointed out: Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the wise command of Deputy Commander Peng, the revolutionary war of the people of the Border Region has achieved a great victory, successively recovering 23 county towns within the Border Region (note: adding Heshui and Ganquan, which were recently recovered, the total reaches 25), and liberating Shenmu and Fugou, which belong to Jin-Sui, and newly establishing the people's government of the Huanglong sub-district, which governs eight counties. In the expanded Guanzhong sub-district, democratic governments have been newly established in Gouyi, @ County, Sanyuan, and Zhong (bu) Yi (jun) counties. Chairman Lin then spoke of the great achievements of the Border Region people in supporting the front lines, stating: In terms of manpower, large numbers of young and middle-aged people have poured into the main forces, and the local armed guerrilla forces have developed more than threefold. Wu Manyou, Liu Yuhou, Yang Buhao and others joining the army demonstrate the true qualities of the labor heroes of the Border Region. The joining of the army by comrades such as He Xingwang, the head of Ansai County, and Zhao Yuwen, the head of Zhidan County, has played a great role in inspiring cadres and the masses and educating new recruits. In terms of material resources, although the Border Region has suffered serious damage from the Hu bandits, severe disasters, and reduced production, the people of the Border Region, regardless of gender or age, are not afraid of hardship and wholeheartedly support the front lines. This enthusiasm is, as Deputy Commander Peng said, "The working people of the Border Region are the most conscious and most knowledgeable people politically." Chairman Lin then gave a detailed account of the measures taken in recent years to strengthen local armed militias, restore wartime industrial and agricultural production, develop education, and conduct wartime reorganizations, such as the two personnel streamlining and the reduction of living standards, as well as the implementation of financial unification with the Jin-Sui Border Region. He reviewed the dereliction of duty and serious tendencies of some cadres to become detached from the masses during the war, and pointed out that these shortcomings and errors have been gradually corrected and overcome with the victories on the front lines and the rectification in the rear. The second part of Chairman Lin's report gave a detailed summary and instructions on economic recovery and disaster relief. He thanked the fraternal liberated areas for their concern and assistance, such as the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region assisting the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Border Region with 200,000 shi of fine grains, and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region also assisting with 1 million jin of cotton and 800,000 bolts of cloth. When talking about the development of industry and commerce, Chairman Lin said: The Border Region government has decided to exempt business taxes this year to restore and prosper the Border Region market. In addition, attention will be paid to the restoration of public-owned and cooperative economies, and public-owned factories such as petroleum, agricultural tools, chemicals, and matches. Civil transport and the textile industry must be vigorously developed. Finally, Chairman Lin called on government workers to work hard to serve the people, so as to greet the great task of liberating the Northwest.
