　　[Taihang News] Since the launch of the land law propaganda movement in the border areas of Xiuwu, the masses who had left due to famine or enemy coercion, as well as rich peasants who were afraid of mass struggle, have now returned home one after another to settle down and divide the land. According to the recent statistics from eight villages in the border area of the county's first district, 24 households have returned in the past ten days, including two rich peasant households, six middle peasant households, and sixteen poor peasant households, totaling 84 people. A fellow villager from Jiaopo Village who returned from Zhengzhou said that the people who fled there had heard that: "The Eighth Route Army has issued new decrees, treating people with leniency and distributing land equally. Therefore, everyone wants to return." He also brought a letter from a rich peasant named Han Tianlu to the democratic government, saying that there was no way to survive in the south and that he wanted to return. Zhao, the district chief of our first district, told him immediately after hearing this: As long as he can implement the government's decrees and engage in production properly after returning, the government will definitely guarantee his livelihood. After this news spread, the fleeing households got to the bottom of things, and the number of returnees increased day by day. Li Zuofu from Li Guizuo Village, who was in the self-defense regiment in Xiuwu City, immediately ran back after hearing the news of the equal distribution of land. At first, he didn't quite believe it. When he saw the cadres, he said: "I'm risking my life to come back to see you. If I don't die, it will be a bright future." After the masses explained it to him, he was very happy and said: "This time, I've made the right choice!" The villagers who returned from Xiama Village praised after listening carefully to our land law: "The Eighth Route Army's method is really good."

　　听说实行土地法逃亡户纷纷返家
    【太行消息】修武边地自开展了宣传土地法的运动后，以前因灾荒或被敌威迫出去的群众，及害怕群众斗争的富农，现已纷纷回来安家分田。据最近该县边地一区八个村的统计，在十天内，即已先后回来了二十四户，内有富农二户、中农六户、贫农十六户，共八十四人。从郑州回来的一个焦坡村老乡，他说逃在那边的人都听说：“八路军新法令下来了，宽大待人，还平分土地，所以，人人都想回来。”他还替一个富农韩天洛向民主政府捎来个信，说在南边一点办法也没有，想回来。我一区赵区长听到这事后，当即告诉他说：只要他回来能执行政府法令，好好生产，政府一定保障他的生活。这个消息传过去后，逃亡户摸了底，回来的一天比一天多起来。李贵作村有个李作富，他是在修武城干自卫团的，听到平分土地的消息后，便立即跑了回来。开始他还有些不信，见了干部就这样说：“我是破着死回来见你们的，死不了可就是个光明大道。”经群众向他解释后，他非常高兴，并且说：“这次可弄对了！”下马村回来的老乡在细细听了我们的土地法后，便这样称赞着：“八路军这办法真好。”
