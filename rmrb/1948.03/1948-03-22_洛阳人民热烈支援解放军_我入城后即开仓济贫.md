Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 20th: The local people warmly welcomed and actively supported the People's Liberation Army (PLA) during the liberation of Luoyang. Before the liberation, there were slogans in Luoyang such as "Down with the 206th Division, support Chairman Mao." When the PLA advanced towards Luoyang, people in Yiyang, Yichuan, Dengfeng, and the suburbs of Luoyang offered tea and water, welcoming them along the way. They complained to the PLA about the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They said: "Wheat sells for more than 1 million [currency unit] per斗, while one亩 of land only sells for 700,000. The township government is pressing for grain and money every day. We are counting on you to save us." In a village in Jiuxian Township, Luoyang, on the second day after the PLA arrived, villagers joined with neighboring villages to divide up the grain and wealth of the big tyrant landlord Du. People on both sides of the Yi River and Luo River built bridges at various crossings when they heard about the attack on Luoyang, and voluntarily sent people to guard the crossings. On the night before the PLA attacked the city, villagers in a village east of Luoyang told the PLA in detail about the Chiang bandits' defensive fortifications in Dongguan. A villager volunteered to lead the way to attack Dongguan. Villages in the suburbs rushed to build scaling ladders for the PLA. Women ground flour and made pancakes for the PLA day and night. Each village also formed temporary combat teams to transport supplies and ammunition to the front lines and rescue the wounded. During the battle at the West Railway Station, railway workers automatically guided the PLA to clear landmines. After entering the city, citizens displayed square tables on the streets, prepared cigarettes and tea, to welcome and console the PLA.

Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 20th: After the liberation of Luoyang, the democratic municipal government opened granaries to relieve the poor. On the 14th, 150,000斤 of grain and more than 5,000斤 of salt were distributed in Si Guan and the railway station area alone. On the 15th and 16th, in addition to continuing to distribute grain, clothing and cotton from the Chiang bandit military warehouses were distributed to poor citizens.

    洛阳人民　热烈支援解放军
    我入城后即开仓济贫
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十日电】洛阳解放之战，当地人民热烈欢迎，并积极支援解放军。在解放前，洛市就有“打倒二○六师，拥护毛主席”的标语出现。当解放军挺进洛阳途中，伊阳、伊川、登封等地及洛阳近郊人民都烧茶送水，夹道欢迎。纷纷向解放军控拆蒋匪暴政。他们说：麦子每斗卖到一百多万，一亩地才卖七十万元，乡公所天天催粮逼款，咱就盼你们救命。洛阳九贤乡某村，在解放军到达的第二天，就联合邻村农民把大恶霸地主杜某的粮财分光。伊河、洛河两岸人民听说打洛阳，就在各渡口架桥，并自动派人守护渡口。解放军攻城前夜，洛东某村村民就把蒋匪在东关的防御工事详细告诉了解放军，一村民并自告奋勇带领去打东关。城郊各村庄都为解放军赶造云梯。妇女们日夜给解放军磨面烙饼。各村并组有临时参战队，向火线运送给养弹药和抢救伤员。西车站战斗中，铁路工人自动引导解放军扫除地雷。攻入城后，市民都在街上陈列方桌，备有烟茶，向解放军欢迎慰问。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十日电】洛阳解放后，民主市政府即开仓济贫。十四日，仅四关和车站等处就发放粮食十五万斤，盐五千多斤。十五、十六两日，除继续发粮外，又将蒋匪军用仓库中的衣服、棉花等发给贫苦市民。
