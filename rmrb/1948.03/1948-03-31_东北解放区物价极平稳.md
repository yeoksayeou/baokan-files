Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th – Prices in the Northeast Liberated Areas have generally been extremely stable since the beginning of the year. With the exception of slight increases in sorghum rice, millet, and soybeans, prices for other commodities, such as coal, have been steadily decreasing due to miners actively increasing production in various locations. In Harbin, the market price of sorghum rice was 160 yuan per jin in January, and 200 yuan in mid-March. Coal prices dropped from 22,000 yuan per ton in January to 20,000 yuan per ton in mid-March. In Jiamusi, the market price of millet was 140 yuan per jin in January, and 160 yuan in mid-March. Sea salt was 420 yuan per jin in January, and 500 yuan in mid-March. In Qiqihar, the market price of medium-grade foreign flour was 450 yuan per jin in January, and 500 yuan in mid-March; blue serge cloth was 2,000 yuan per chi in January and remained at 2,000 yuan in mid-March. The price of gold in the aforementioned areas was 500,000 yuan per tael in January, and 510,000 yuan in mid-March, an increase of only 10,000 yuan. In the isolated cities of Changchun and Shenyang controlled by the Chiang bandits, prices are skyrocketing, and the people are suffering beyond endurance. For example, in Shenyang, coal prices rose from 1.8 million yuan to 2.5 million yuan per ton of Chiang bandit currency (each yuan equivalent to ten yuan of Chiang bandit domestic currency) in the one-month period from December of last year to the end of January this year. In February, sorghum rice had already risen to 10,000 yuan per jin of Chiang bandit currency.

　　东北解放区物价极平稳
    【新华社东北二十九日电】东北解放区各地物价自开年以来一般皆极平稳。除高粱米、小米、大豆等略有上涨外，其他如煤价则因各地矿工积极增产而日益下降。哈尔滨市高粱米一月份每斤市价一百六十元，三月中旬为二百元，煤则由一月份的每吨两万二千元跌至三月中旬的每吨两万元。佳木斯一月份小米市价每斤一百四十元，三月中旬为一百六十元，海盐一月份每斤四百二十元，三月中旬为五百元。齐齐哈尔洋面中等每斤市价一月份为四百五十元，三月中旬为五百元；青斜纹布每尺市价一月份为两千元，三月中旬仍为两千元。上述各地黄金价一月份每两为五十万元，三月中旬为五十一万元，仅上涨一万元。蒋匪孤城长春沈阳等地物价则扶摇直上，民不堪命，如沈阳自去年十二月至今年一月底的一个月时间中，煤即从每吨蒋匪流通券（每元合蒋匪关内币十元）一百八十万元涨至二百五十万元，二月间高粱米每斤已涨至蒋匪流通券一万元。
