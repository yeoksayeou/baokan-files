　　Starting from the Long-Term Interests of the Masses,
  　The Border Government Calls for Afforestation
  　This Year, Each Person Must Plant and Keep Alive at Least One Tree
    [Our News] The Border Region Government, given that the tree planting season has arrived, has issued a call for afforestation throughout the region. It begins by stating: Afforestation is a major undertaking for a hundred years of construction. Cultivating forests, increasing by-products, regulating rainfall, and preventing floods and droughts are all facilities that brook no delay. Moreover, with the intertwined victories of the war and land reform, construction endeavors are developing daily, and the supply of timber is becoming even more pressing. After the peasants have turned themselves around, they must take a long-term view and get rich. Afforestation is also an important undertaking. The sooner we start, the sooner we will profit. Any disregard or waiting is a harmful ideology that does not value the long-term interests of the masses and the great construction cause, and it should be overcome. The call then immediately points out the specific requirements for afforestation this year: First, existing forests on prohibited mountains should be effectively protected by determining land rights in accordance with the government's measures for cultivating and protecting forests. Second, sowing seeds for afforestation in mountainous areas, planting branches in plains, and planting trees in sandy areas, riverbanks, roadsides, and along railways should all be started as soon as possible, and tree species and saplings should be prepared early. Third, areas with the conditions should strive to plant at least one tree per person this year, and constantly pay attention to protection and irrigation to ensure a survival rate of over 80 percent. Areas with conditions for planting productive trees should also promote the planting of productive trees. Finally, it is stated that the tree planting season has arrived and that work should begin as soon as possible. Disaster areas can use the method of work-for-relief to combine afforestation with disaster relief. In general areas, loans can also be used to support the masses in cultivating nurseries and purchasing tree species and saplings when necessary. In conclusion, it calls on leading production organizations at all levels and the masses of the entire region to take action immediately and strive to complete this year's afforestation plan.

　　从群众长远利益出发
  　边府号召植树造林
  　今年每人最少要栽活一棵树
    【本报消息】边区政府，以目前植树季节已到，特向全区发出植树造林号召。首称：植树造林为百年建设大计。在培植林木，增加副产，调节雨量，防洪防旱上，都是刻不容缓的设施。且战争土改交辉胜利，建设事业，日益开展，木材供应更加迫切。农民在翻身后，从长期着眼，发家致富，植树造林，亦为重要事业。能早动手一年，即能早获利一年。任何轻视等待，都是不重视群众长远利益及伟大建设事业的有害思想，应加克服。号召中继即指出今年植树造林的具体要求是：第一、现有林木禁山，应按本府林木培植保护办法，确定地权切实保护。第二、山地播种造林，平原插枝植树，以及沙区、河岸、公路、铁路道旁等植树，都应即早动手，树种树秧，更应早作准备。第三、有条件地区，争取本年每人最少要植一株树，并经常注意保护灌溉，保证成活数在百分之八十以上。有种植生产树条件的地区，并提倡种植生产树。最后并称：植树季节已到，应即早动手。灾区可用以工代赈办法，使造林与救灾结合。一般地区，必要时亦可以贷款支持群众培植苗圃购买树种树秧。末尾并向各级领导生产机关及全区群众号召立即行动起来，为完成本年植树造林计划而努力。
