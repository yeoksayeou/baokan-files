　　Establishing a Farmers' Congress and Re-electing the Village Government
  　Zhao Village Full of New Democratic Atmosphere
    [Our News] After the establishment of the New Farmers' Association in Zhao Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, the village government was re-elected from February 19th to 24th in a thoroughly democratic manner. The specific steps were: First, establish a Farmers' Representative Congress. Second, completely re-elect the Village Government Committee. The establishment of the Farmers' Congress began with the Poor Peasants' League Committee and the mass meetings of each street conducting research on the 19th, clarifying its nature, power, and tasks, its relationship with the Farmers' Association and the village government, and how representatives would be produced. On the morning of the 20th, all households in the village were broken up from the traditional neighborhood units and organized into 42 small groups of ten to fifteen households (households that had been struggled against did not participate; middle peasants and poor peasants were mixed together), and group meetings were held to nominate three representative candidates from each group, followed by elections. Finally, 42 representatives were elected. On the evening of the 21st, the first Farmers' Representative Congress was held, chaired by Zhao Fushan, chairman of the Farmers' Association. The 42 representatives, each carrying the opinions of their groups, conducted careful research at the meeting and unanimously decided that the Village Government Committee should only have seven members: the village head and deputy head, finance, warehouse, war support, education, and production cooperation. On the 22nd and 23rd, the 42 groups continued to meet, nominating candidates for the Village Government Committee. On the morning of the 24th (the Lantern Festival), the representatives led their constituents into the designated area in the large temple grounds east of the village to hold a Village Government Committee election meeting. A total of more than 540 male and female villagers attended, with Zhao Fushan, chairman of the Farmers' Congress, serving as chairman. The election was conducted by raising fists and checking and counting by area. As a result, seven committee members, including Jin Yintai, were elected from the fifteen candidates. According to everyone's opinion, Jin Yintai, who received the most votes, and Communist Party member Meng Nanfang shared the positions of village head and deputy head.
    　　　　In the past, electing cadres was a "through" process, forcing the masses to "pass"
    [Our News] This re-election of the village government in Zhao Village was carried out entirely in accordance with the demands of the masses of the village. According to the reflections of the masses before and after this election, everyone unanimously believed that it was not democratic enough in the past. The masses said that in the past, elections were when the "insiders" discussed and decided who to elect, and then told the masses who to elect. At most, they would ask the masses: "Who are you planning to elect?" The masses said: "We'll elect whoever you say." An activist would say: "I think so-and-so is good," and the masses would follow along saying: "Good, good, good." During the election, activists would spread out among the masses, one person shouting: "I nominate ×××, does everyone agree?" The people who had been arranged would shout "Agree" in unison, and others, seeing that they could not disagree, would follow along and agree. Such elections were only held a few times when a cadre position became vacant due to special reasons. Many important cadres had never been re-elected.
    This election, from beginning to end, embodied the public will of the masses and fully promoted the spirit of the masses being the masters of their own affairs. The villagers all said that this was a truly democratic election that had never happened before. As for the Farmers' Congress, the representative candidates were completely and without restriction chosen by the individual peasant groups. Whoever was chosen was chosen. The work team did not make any special explanation or give any hints about anyone who might be elected.
    　　　　This Election is Truly Democratic: Choosing the Best from Among Good People
    The candidates chosen by the masses had to report their own history to everyone, review any shortcomings they had had, and express their determination to correct them; the masses also gave them their opinions. When Zhao Shuangshan and Zhao Dongzhi competed to be representatives in the first group, everyone pointed out that Zhao Shuangshan's shortcoming was that he did not work hard enough. He was not very convinced, feeling that he worked quite well, even doing odd jobs to earn rice. Voter Zhao Caishan said: "You work, but after earning thirty or fifty catties of rice, you want to rest, smoke cigarettes, and when you run out, you have to go out and suffer again. You and your wife have nine mu of land, and the land is not bad, so why are you short every year?" The masses felt that this opinion was correct and did not elect him. He had nothing to say and resolved to work hard in the future. In the seventeenth group, Jin Changhe and Jin Chengke competed in the group. They were both good at labor, upright, not selfish, and did not oppress people; both of them had these qualities. But when the masses finally compared "who is more enthusiastic about serving everyone," it turned out that Jin Chengke was not as good as Jin Changhe, so Jin Changhe was elected as the representative.
    From the election results, the first characteristic is that honest and upright laboring peasants are the most supported: among the forty-two representatives, thirty-one were honest poor peasants and farmhands, twenty of whom were poor peasants and farmhands for more than two generations. The other six new middle peasants and four old middle peasants were also recognized as honest peasants. Second, those who actively acted solely to attack old cadres, engaged in sectarian revenge and pursued personal status, and only cared about their own affairs and not about everyone's affairs, could not be elected. As long as the leadership fully promotes democracy and follows the mass line, things generally will not go wrong, and the masses themselves will be able to manage their own affairs.
    　　　　Changing Village Government Organizations According to Actual Needs
    The election of Village Government Committee members was also carried out in a fully democratic manner.
    First, the organizational structure of the village government, what committee members were needed, what committee members were not needed, and what could be merged were all decided by the representative groups through discussion. For example, everyone thought that the former civil affairs director was not necessary. Matters of mediating disputes could be handled by the various representatives and the village head and deputy head at any time, so it was decided to abolish the position. The public security officer was previously appointed by the government and was responsible for eliminating traitors and preventing special agents. Everyone felt that this task could be undertaken by the Poor Peasants' League. Anyone with political problems or disruptive behavior could be exposed by everyone, and the village government would handle it, so it was also decided to abolish the position. Previously, there was a production director and a separate cooperative system, and the masses felt that unified leadership should be established, so it was decided to combine them into a Production and Cooperation Committee.
    Second, the fifteen candidates for the Village Government Committee were completely and without restriction selected by the various groups from the people of the entire village. The forty-two representative groups submitted forty-two lists of candidates, and to express their wishes, they specified who should be the village head and deputy head, and who should be which committee member. Finally, the fifteen people with the most votes on the forty-two lists were selected as candidates. The people nominated by everyone were generally the same.
    Third, in order to let the people of the entire village understand each candidate and not be careless in the election, the fifteen candidates each gave a self-introduction speech at the Village Government Committee election meeting on the 24th, and the masses once again gave them suggestions and criticisms. In addition to explaining that they had been long-term laborers or mountain land reclaimers in the past, the candidates almost all mentioned some of their own shortcomings: "I speak decisively," "I have a proud temper." The masses did not give more opinions to those who knew their own problems, only saying: "It's enough if you know it yourself."
    Fourth, in order to avoid cliquism (parochialism) and manipulation by a few people, the several groups from the same street were dispersed in different places, not crowded together. When raising fists, they were checked and counted by area to ensure that one person was not influenced by another. Judging from the number of votes, the masses considered each of the fifteen people one by one. Of the more than 500 people who participated in the election, the candidate who received the most votes received 462 votes, and the candidate who received the fewest votes received as few as 70 or so votes. Looking at the elected committee members, the characteristic is that the election of the Farmers' Congress was basically the same.
            Admonishing New Cadres to be Good Hired Hands
    Fifth, after the election, the chairman asked everyone to advise the hired hands in the capacity of masters. Although it was past noon and time for lunch, eighteen peasants still gave opinions to the new cadres. The tone was completely caring and concerned, but also strict. For example: "Accounts must be cleared frequently, cleared once every time they are handled, and announced to everyone every two or three months, not like before, when they were not announced for two or three years." "Stand firm, don't listen to this and that, don't be greedy for money. If others have bad intentions, don't follow them." "If the masses give opinions, don't band together to suppress them, and don't arbitrarily label them." "Don't forget the poor when you are in charge," "Don't be arrogant," and so on. Some used the mistakes of the old cadres to warn the new cadres: "In the years of famine, the government distributed relief grain, but the village cadres dragged their feet and did not distribute it, and people starved to death." "Those who had connections went to collect grain, and it was issued to them immediately; those who didn't have connections waited for a long time, waiting for a day, and received three catties of rice with half a catty of dirt mixed in, and the poor shed tears but dared not say anything." Some gave positive warnings to the new cadres "not to listen to gossip, not to listen to old cadres stirring up internal strife." Someone said: "When a hired hand hoes the ground, he must hoe it well, not like the previous cadres who just covered it up superficially (shirked responsibility)." One person alone instructed the new village head Jin Yintai: "You must be as concerned about the poor as you were when you were a hired hand in Chongyi (belongs to the Eighth District of Wu'an), and you will never do anything bad." Positive suggestions included quickly announcing the cooperative and village financial accounts, registering public property and fruits, distributing dividends, adjusting land, preparing for spring plowing, and removing the labels of special agents. Others reminded the masses: "We must be rich peasant masters, work with the hired hands and supervise them; don't be landlord masters, sitting back and doing nothing, just scolding the hired hands." Finally, someone asked the new cadres to express their attitude and see if they could act according to the opinions of the masses. The new cadres accepted them one by one, and the atmosphere was very harmonious and pleasant. After the meeting, no one wanted to leave.
            Elected with Heartfelt Satisfaction, Everyone is Full of Joy
    What kind of people are the newly elected cadres? Why were they able to be elected? Take the new village head Jin Yintai, for example, he is a poor peasant who has been a long-term laborer for twenty-two years. According to the masses in Fourth Street, when he was a long-term laborer in Chongyi, the poor people here had nothing to eat, so they went down to find work. If they were hungry, he would find something to eat for them. If it was dark, he would find a place to stay for them. If their clothes got wet in the rain, he would find dry clothes for them to change into, and then help them find work. Some people went to the enemy area to buy cotton, and he would lead them back and forth past the blockhouse in the middle of the night. "Jin Yintai really cares about the poor." Whether it's labor or personal character, he's good enough in every way. This is the unanimous conclusion. Production Committee member Guo Jiasuo is also a similar type of person to Jin Yintai. When others graze sheep, they intentionally or unintentionally let them eat some of other people's crops. He grazed sheep from the age of fourteen to the age of thirty, and never let the sheep damage the crops. Last year, the masses of sixteen neighborhoods raised cotton as shares and opened a flour mill. He was the neighborhood leader, and he took his own expenses, missed work, and carried cotton to Yangyi to sell for everyone without complaint. People all know that he is an upright person who "only disadvantages himself, not others." Last year, he wanted to move, and the old woman Jin Haozhong, a neighbor in the same courtyard, cried, feeling that she would no longer have such a good person to take care of her in the future when it came to burning firewood and drinking water. Zhao Fushan, chairman of the Farmers' Congress, is a hired worker and a veteran of the People's Liberation Army. He is thirty-two years old this year. When he was young, his family had nothing. His mother sold bean sprouts and cakes, and his father did odd jobs and sold oil... "It was common to not eat for three or two days. If we earned something today, we ate it today. If we didn't earn anything, we went hungry." From the age of ten, he went to Liaoxian to herd cattle for others. When he left, he didn't even eat a meal, and his parents sent him off crying. It was very cold in the mountains. Fushan wore clothes made of burlap and felt strung together with rope. In the cold weather, he had no socks, his feet were frostbitten, and he still had to climb mountains. His father was at home, and when he heard people say that Fushan had "run down the slope" (fallen off a cliff), he was so anxious that he "went crazy." He never recovered from this illness before he died. He returned home at the age of eleven, and he still couldn't carry water, so he became a small long-term laborer for a wealthy man in his village, working from the age of eleven to the age of twenty-six. At the age of twenty-seven, he joined the People's Liberation Army. He served as a soldier for three years, and later became a squad leader and platoon leader. His right wrist was injured in the Jixian battle, and he returned home last August. Although he was not very good at farming, he still tried hard to farm, "If I can't do it quickly, I'll do it slowly." He was very active in Zhao Village's development of the democratic land reform movement, and his speeches were correct. He first became the initiator of the Poor Peasants' League, and later was elected as the chairman of the Poor Peasants' League and the chairman of the Farmers' Association. Zhao Fushan, vice chairman of the Farmers' Congress and a Communist Party member, had also been a hired worker. Now, he still goes back to dig cave dwellings late at night to earn money. He is a model in the mutual aid group, both working himself and leading others to work. He has never competed to share good land or good houses, and he is still the same as ordinary poor peasants. The other committee members, whether middle peasants or poor peasants, are all honest and upright people, such as Jin Fuyou, who only dared to speak out in this movement. When the masses talked about this group of new cadres, their faces were full of smiles, and their tone and manner were consistent. Judging from the atmosphere after the meeting, a new atmosphere has indeed begun to emerge. The masses all say that this election was "really satisfying," and that it was "truly and undoubtedly a democratic election." Satisfied faces can be seen at any time during meals, meetings, and casual conversations.

### 成立农代会改选村政府　赵庄充满民主新气象

　　成立农代会改选村政府
  　赵庄充满民主新气象
    【本报消息】武安九区赵庄村新农会成立后，紧接着就在二月十九日至二十四日以彻底民主的方式改选村政府。具体步骤：一是建立农民代表会。二是全部改选村政府委员会。农代会的建立，首先是贫农团委员会与各街群众会在十九号做了研究，弄清它的性质、权力与任务，它和农会、村政府的关系，代表如何产生等。又于二十号上午将全村住户打破街闾，编成四十二个十户到十五户的小组（被斗户没有参加，中农与贫农混合编制），普遍召开小组会，每组提出三个代表候选人，然后竞选。最后选出四十二个代表。二十一日晚，召开第一届农民代表会，会议主席由农会主席赵伏山担任。四十二个代表各自带着小组的意见，在会上做了仔细研究，一致决定：村政府委员只要七个：正、副村长，财政、仓库、战勤、教育、生产合作。二十二、二十三两日，四十二个小组继续集会，提出村政府委员候选人。二十四日（旧历元宵）上午，代表们率领着自己的选民依次进入村东大庙场中划定的地点，开选举村政府委员大会。共到男女村民五百四十多人，仍由农代主席赵伏山任主席，用举拳头分片查算办法进行选举。结果，在十五个候选人中选出靳银太等七个委员。根据大家的意见，票数最多的靳银太与共产党员孟南方二人分担正、副村长。
    　　　　从前选举干部“通”强迫命令群众“过”
    【本报消息】赵庄这次改选村政权的大选，完全是依照全村群众的要求进行的。根据群众在这次大选前后的反映，都一致认为以前太不民主。群众说，以前选举是“里头”商量妥了要选谁，就告诉群众选谁。顶多也不过问问群众：“你们打算选谁？”群众说：“选谁也照。”活动分子说：“我看某某人就照，”群众跟着说：“照照照。”选举时，积极分子们分散到群众中去，一个人喊：“我提×××大家赞成不赞成？”布置好的人轰的一声“赞成”，别人看见自己不赞成也不行，便跟着赞成完事。就是这样的选举，也只是在某一干部位置因特殊原因出了缺时举行过不多几次。许多重要干部从来没有改选过。
    这次大选，从头到尾贯穿了群众的公意，充分发扬了群众当家的精神。村民都说这是从来未有过的真正民选。从农代会说，代表的候选人完全无限制的由各个农民小组自己来挑，挑上谁算谁。工作组对任何可能当选的人不做特别说明，不加任何暗示。
    　　　　这次大选真民主　好人里头挑好人
    群众挑出来的候选人要给大家报告自己历史，检讨自己曾经有过什么毛病，表示决心改正；群众也给他们提意见。第一组赵双山与赵冬至竞选代表时，大家提出赵双山的缺点是劳动不好。他不大服气，觉得自己劳动也还可以，还给人家打短工赚米。选民赵才山说：“你劳动也劳动，可是赚上三二十斤米就想歇歇，吸吸纸烟，花完了没办法，才又出去受。你两口子九亩地，地又不坏，为啥年年不够头？”群众觉得这个意见对，就没有选他。他没话说，决心以后好好劳动。第十七组靳长河与靳成科两个人在小组竞选，劳动好，人正派，不自私，不压迫人，这些条件两个人都有；但在群众最后比较“谁给大家办事热心”时，都比出来靳成科不如靳长河，于是靳长河当选了代表。
    从选举结果上看，第一个特点是老实正派的劳动农民最受拥护：四十二个代表当中，有三十一个是老实贫雇农，其中二十个是两辈子以上的贫雇。另外六个新中农，四个老中农，也都是公认的老实农民。第二，单纯为着打击旧干部而积极活动的，闹宗派报复与个人地位的，只关心自己事情，不关心大家事情的，都不能当选。只要领导上充分发扬民主，走群众路线，一般是搞不坏的，群众自己是会当家的。
    　　　　根据实际需要改变村政组织
    关于村政府委员的选举，也同样充分发扬了民主。
    第一，村政府的组织机构，要什么委员，不要什么委员，什么可以合并，都由代表小组讨论决定。比如，从前的民事主任，大家认为没有也行。调解纠纷的事情，可以让各个代表和正副村长随时办，于是决定取消。公安员，以前是政府委派的，负责除奸防特。大家觉得这事情可以由贫农团担任，谁有政治问题或破坏行为，可以由大家揭发，村政府办理，所以也决定取消。以前有生产主任，又有独立的合作社系统，群众认为应该统一领导，就决定合设生产合作委员。
    第二，十五个村政府委员的候选人，完全让各小组无限制的从全村人民中挑选。四十二个代表小组，提出了四十二张候选人名单，他们为表明自己意愿，谁当村长村副，谁当什么委员，都写明了。最后在四十二张名单上挑出十五个票数最多的人来做候选人。大家提的人，大体都差不多。
    第三，为着让全村群众了解每个候选人，选起来不马虎，十五个候选人都在二十四号的村政府委员选举大会上做了一次自我介绍性质的竞选发言，群众也对他们进行了再一次的建议与批评。候选人发言，除说明自己过去是住长工的、开山地的等以外，差不多都提到一些自己的缺点：“我说话决”，“我脾气傲”。群众对这些知道自己毛病的人没提更多意见，只说：“自己知道就行。”
    第四，为着不致发生片片主义（本位），被少数人操纵，同街的几个小组分散坐在几处，不挤在一块。举拳头时分片查，分片算，保证一个人不受另一个人影响。从票数上看，群众对这十五个人是一个个做了考虑的。参加选举的五百多人，候选人得票最多的四百六十二票，票少的少至七十来票。从选举出的委员看，其特点是农代会选举基本一致。
            叮咛新干部当个好长工
    第五，选举完毕以后，主席要求大家以主人的资格嘱咐嘱咐长工。虽然时已过午，早该吃饭了，但仍有十八个农民对新干部提了意见。口气完全是爱护的、关切的，但又是严格的。比如说：“要时常清帐，办一回清一回，三两个月就给大家公布一回，不要象以前两三年不公布。”“站稳立场，不要听东过西，见财起意，别人起了坏心事，自己不要跟着干。”“群众提了意见，不要抱成一疙瘩打击群众，乱给群众扣帽子。”“不要执了事忘了穷人，”“不要自高自大”等。有人用旧干部的错误警惕新干部：“灾荒年政府发下来救济粮，村干部拖着不发，饿死人。”“有情面的去领粮，一去就发给了；没情面的去领，等半天，等一天，领上三斤米，里面掺的半斤土，穷人掉泪不敢吭。”有人正面警告新干部“不要听闲话，不要听旧干部挑拨闹内战。”有人说：“当长工锄地要锄好，不要象先前干部猫盖屎（应付）。”一个人单独吩咐新村长靳银太说：“你要边照你在崇义（武安八区属）当长工那时候关乎（关心）穷人，就永没有个办坏。”积极的建议，则有赶快公布合作社、村财政帐目，登记公产、果实，分红利，调剂土地，准备春耕，摘特务帽子等。另外也有人提醒群众：“咱们大家当掌柜要当富农掌柜，跟长工一块干，监督他们；不要当地主掌柜，坐着不管，光骂长工。”末后又有人要求新干部表示态度，看是不是能照群众意见办。新干部一一接受，空气非常融洽、愉快。散了会也不想散的样子。
            选得真碰心事人人喜气洋洋
    当选的新干部都是些什么样的人呢？他们为什么能当选呢？就说新村长靳银太吧，这是一个当过廿二年长工的贫农。据四街群众说他在崇义当长工时，这边穷人没啥吃，下去找活，饿了就给你找东西吃，天黑了给你找地方住，雨淋了衣服给你找干衣服换上，回头又帮你找活。有人下去到敌区买棉花，人家半夜三更领上你从炮楼跟前来回过。“靳银太可真是关乎穷人。”无论劳动，无论为人，那一头也够得上。这是一致的结论。生产委员郭家锁，也是和靳银太一类型的人物。别人放羊都要有意无意的吃人家点庄稼，他从十四岁放羊放到三十岁，从不让羊糟害庄稼。去年十六闾群众凑集棉花当股金，开了个粉坊，他当闾长，自己带盘费，误上工，背着棉花到阳邑去替大家卖，毫无怨言。人们都知道他是“只亏自己，不亏旁人”的正直人。去年他想搬家，同院的邻家靳好忠老婆子就哭起来，觉得以后烧柴吃水怕再没有这样好的人关照她了。农代会主席赵伏山，是一个雇工，又是人民解放军的退伍军人。今年卅二岁。他小的时候，家中什么都没有。母亲卖豆芽、饼子，父亲打短工、卖油………“三天两天不吃饭是如常事，今天挣了今天吃，挣不来就饿着。”从十岁开始，到辽县给人家放牛。走的时候，饭都没有吃，父母哭着送他。山上是很冷的，伏山穿着布袋片、毡片用绳子串起来的衣服。大冷天，没袜子，脚冻烂了，还得爬山。父亲在家，听人说伏山“跑了坡”（从山崖跌下），急得“心疯了”，临死时这个病也没有好。十一岁回了家，还挑不动水，就给本村财主当小长工，从十一岁一直干到二十六岁。二十七岁，他参加了人民解放军。当了三年战士，以后当班长、排长。在汲县战斗中右腕被打伤，去年八月，退伍回家。种地虽不大得劲了，还是努力种地，“不能干快点，干慢点。”赵庄开展民主填补运动，他很积极，发言也正确，先当了贫农团发起人，以后被选成贫农团主席和农会主席。农代会副主席共产党员赵福山，以前也是一直当雇工，现在开会半夜回去还要打窑洞赚钱，在互助组自己劳动、带领别人劳动，都是模范，好地好房从来没有争着去分，至今仍和一般贫农一样。其他委员不论是中农贫农都是老实正派人，象靳福有，是在这次运动中才敢说话的一个。群众在谈到这批新干部时，脸上都堆着笑，声调口吻都是一致的。从会后空气看，新的气象确已开始出现。群众这个也“选得真碰心事”，那个也“的的确确是民选”，吃饭、开会、扯闲话的场合，随时都可看到满意的脸色。
