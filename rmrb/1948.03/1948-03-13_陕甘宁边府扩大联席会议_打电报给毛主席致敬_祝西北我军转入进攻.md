　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government Holds Enlarged Joint Conference
  　Sends Telegram to Chairman Mao to Pay Respects
  　Congratulates the Northwest People's Liberation Army on Transitioning to Offensive
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th] The enlarged joint conference of the Standing Committee members of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly and members of the Border Region Government was recently held in Suide City. The conference sent a special telegram to Chairman Mao to pay respects, stating: "For more than ten years, under your direct leadership, the people of our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have vigorously supported the great War of Resistance Against Japan and achieved final victory. During the War of Resistance, we carried out the construction of New Democracy, enabling the people to truly live a peaceful, prosperous, free, and happy life. When the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and his bandit gang, with the direct assistance of the American imperialists, frantically invaded our border region in March of last year, you and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China joined the people of the border region in arduous struggle. Under your correct guidance, our heroic and battle-tested Northwest People's Liberation Army has shattered the invasion of the Chiang-Hu bandit troops and transitioned to the offensive. In the future, we and all the people of the border region will continue to go deep among the masses under your banner, implement land reform, develop production, work hard to provide disaster relief and restore the border region, better support the front lines, and eliminate the Chiang-Hu bandit troops in large numbers, striving to the end for the great cause of liberating the Great Northwest and liberating all of China." The conference also sent a telegram to comfort the officers and soldiers of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, stating in brief: "The conference calls on all the people of the border region to overcome difficulties, restore the construction of the border region, improve war support work, better support the front lines, and at the same time pay attention to improving the methods of giving preferential treatment to military dependents and revolutionary martyrs, so that every soldier has no family worries and can wholeheartedly eliminate the enemy."
