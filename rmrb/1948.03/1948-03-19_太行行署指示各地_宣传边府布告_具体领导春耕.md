Taihang Administrative Office Directs All Localities to Publicize the Border Government Proclamation and Specifically Lead Spring Plowing

[Taihang News] In order to ensure the smooth development of this year's spring plowing work, the Taihang Administrative Office specifically instructed all special districts, counties, and cities in early March on this year's production work. Efforts should be made to increase production by strengthening mutual aid, eliminating wasteland, repairing canals and rivers, and promoting improved varieties. The entire region is also preparing to strive to increase paddy fields by 100,000 mu and plant cotton on 860,000 mu. To this end, attention should be paid to solving the following four problems: (1) Widely publicize the Border Government's proclamation of March 11 stating "Secure Production, Whoever Plants Reaps," stabilize the masses' production sentiment, and intensify spring plowing, and help the masses solve the difficulties of production tools and animal power. In new districts, disaster areas, and border areas, in addition to mutual adjustment, borrowing, and lending, the government should exchange and lend seeds from public grain, which will be returned in full after the autumn harvest. (2) Eliminate cultivated wasteland to increase food production: The amount of cultivated wasteland in our region is still large. In the hinterland, it should be completely eliminated this year, and in the border areas, it should also be eliminated to the greatest extent possible. If it is wasteland of more than two years, it will not be subject to burdens within two years after reclamation. Changes in land ownership will be handled in accordance with the Border Government's proclamation of March 11. If there is remaining wasteland from households without successors or fleeing households, in addition to those already distributed in the land reform, and the masses are unable to reclaim it, the government can hire labor to operate it, and the harvest will be used as a local construction fund. Public land (enemy property, rebel property, etc.) should be divided equally among the farmers if it is a small plot, and the land ownership belongs to private individuals. If there is more wasteland than people and the farmers are unwilling to divide it equally, immigrants can be relocated and the government can help them establish family organizations for production, and the land ownership belongs to them privately, and will not be subject to burdens within three years. The government can organize the reclamation of large plots of land, and if necessary, set up specialized agencies for management (such as the rice field area between Qin and Bo). (3) In terms of repairing canals, managing rivers, preventing drought and increasing production: Our region suffers from drought nine years out of ten. Therefore, small canals should be built using the method of public-private cooperation, combined with relief for the spring famine using the method of work-for-relief, to strive to increase 100,000 mu of paddy fields. Land converted from dry land to paddy fields will be subject to burdens based on dry land in the first year. The banks of the Qin River, Zhang River, and Wei River should be organized early to dredge the river and restore the dikes. Specialized flood control organizations should be established in areas prone to danger to prevent breaches and disasters. (4) In promoting improved varieties and increasing the planting of special crops, in order to achieve self-sufficiency in cotton and dyes and increase wealth, the entire region should plant 860,000 mu of cotton, 40,000 mu of indigo, 100,000 mu of hemp, and 50,000 mu of tobacco this year. It was also pointed out that in the process of promotion, the masses should be allowed to volunteer, and the bad style of blind coercion in the past should be overcome.

[Taihang News] Wu'an Third Elementary School used the temple fair to publicize the Administrative Office's proclamation, which played a significant role. After the Third Elementary School received the Administrative Office's proclamation on "Secure Production, Whoever Plants Reaps" in the Xinhua Daily on March 5, the Boyan Village was holding a mule and horse fair. The elementary school and Boyan Elementary School immediately organized three propaganda teams, divided into four bases at the fair, and wrote the proclamation on public blackboards. Each blackboard had five explainers, who used actual examples to repeatedly explain it to the folks, one by one. More and more farmers listened to the propaganda. Some farmers said after listening, "Listening to this is even better than watching a play! The government is really thoughtful and always doesn't let us poor people suffer." Some said, "We can rest assured after hearing this. No matter when the requisition happens, it is good for our labor and production." Some said, "We shouldn't have been blindly afraid in the past. We have to work hard when we go back!" Another farmer finished listening and said to another farmer, "Let's go! Let's hurry back and work! Even attending the fair can't compare to farming." After listening, the old farmers repeatedly instructed the propagandists, "You have to hurry up and publicize it. The spring is short this year, so don't let those who don't understand delay production."

　　太行行署指示各地
  　宣传边府布告
  　具体领导春耕
    【太行消息】为使今年春耕工作顺利开展，太行行署特于三月初向各地专县市具体指示今年的生产工作，要在加强互助，消灭荒地修渠治河及推广优良品种等方面来努力增产，全区并准备要为增加水田十万亩，种棉八十六万亩而奋斗。为此应注意解决以下四个问题：（一）广泛宣传边府三月十一日布告上说的“安心生产谁种谁收”的规定，安定群众生产情绪加紧春耕，并帮助群众解决生产工具及畜力的困难，在新区、灾区和边地除自相调剂借贷解决外，政府应从公粮中调换贷给种子，秋收后原数归还。（二）消灭熟荒增加粮食：我区熟荒为数仍大，在腹地应于今年全部消灭，边地亦应消灭到最大限度。如系二年以上之荒，在开垦后二年内不出负担，土地有所变动者以边府三月十一日布告处理。如系绝户逃亡户的荒地，除土改中已分配者外，仍有剩余，群众也无力开垦者，政府可雇劳力经营，收获物作地方建设基金。公地（敌产逆产等）如系小块由农民平分，地权归私有，如荒地多人少，农民不愿平分者可移民由政府帮其建立家务组织生产，地权归其私有，三年内不出负担；大块地政府可组织开垦，必要时可设专门机构管理（如沁博间稻田区）。（三）在修渠治河、防旱增产方面：我区十年九旱，因之应以民办公助方法开筑小型水渠，结合救济春荒以工代帐办法，为增加十万亩水田而奋斗。旱田变水田，第一年的按旱田负担。沁河、漳河、卫河沿岸应及早组织浚河复堤，易于出险地带应成立专门防汛组织，以防止决口成灾。（四）在推广优良品种增种特种作物上，为使棉花染料作到自给增加财富，本年全区应种棉花八十六万亩，蓝靛四万亩，麻十万亩，烟叶五万亩。并指出：在推广时，应让群众自愿，要克服以前那种盲目强迫的坏作风。
    【太行消息】武安三完小利用庙会宣传行署布告，起作用很大。当三完小接到三月五日新华日报上行署关于“安心生产谁种谁收”的布告后，伯延村正开骡马大会，完小和伯延小学马上组织了三个宣传队，在大会上分成四个基点，将布告写到大众黑板上，每个黑板有五个说明员，用实际例子，一条一条的给老乡们反复解释，听宣传的农民越来越多，有的农民听了后就说：“听这比看戏还好哩！政府真想的周到，总是不让咱受苦人吃了亏”。也有的说：“听了这话咱就安心了，不管啥时抽补，对咱劳动生产是有好处的。”有的说：“过去可不该瞎怕来，回去可得好好干哩！”还有一个农民听完了就叫另一个农民说：“走吧！咱们赶快回去干吧！再赶会也顶不了种地。”年老的农民听了后再三嘱咐宣传员说：“你们还得赶快宣传哩，今年春短，可不要叫想不通的人再耽误了生产。”
