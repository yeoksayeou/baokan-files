　　Qinyang Penyao Village Work Group Patiently Mobilizes Poor and Hired Peasants
　　[Report from our newspaper] In Penyao Village, the second district of Qinyang, the elimination of feudalism in previous land reform movements was incomplete. The poor and hired peasants did not thoroughly turn themselves around. To this day, landlords and rich peasant cadres still hold great power, and poor peasants are suppressed. The whole village has 420 households, more than 1,800 people, and more than 2,520 mu of land. Most of the poor people make a living by making and selling clay pots. After the work group went down on the tenth day of the first lunar month, they directly sought out the poor and hired peasants. At first, they were not at ease with the work group. After repeated investigation, and the work group showed them their attitude, admitted the mistakes of not working for the poor and hired peasants in the past, and resolutely supported them, their concerns were dispelled, and the entire poor and hired class was excited. The following can be seen from this work:
　　1. It is necessary to firmly express one's attitude in order to gain the trust of the poor and hired peasants. The work group came to Penyao Village and found a broken kiln in Xigou to live in. Inside was a broken bed, occupied by the father of a shepherd. Then they visited several poor peasant households. These people had concerns and dared not speak boldly. The shepherd Ren Quanxing talked for a while and then left on the pretext of a stomach ache. They also found a poor peasant woman, who was a women's chairman who didn't handle affairs. From her mouth, they heard the reason why the poor and hired peasants dared not approach the work group: they did not know what these people were here to do. The next morning, the work group found six honest peasants known from the district to talk in the broken kiln, and after learning that they had not thoroughly turned themselves around, they told them: "We will not leave until you have completely turned yourselves around. This time our poor people will organize a poor peasant league, and the village affairs will be handled by our poor peasants. If you are afraid of the village cadres, it doesn't matter, there are laws above, whoever destroys our turning around will be breaking the law." After three or four hours of discussion, they slowly gained energy. They said, "The six of us are not enough!" Asked them what to do if it wasn't enough, they said they wanted to connect with people. Asked them how many they could call, they said they couldn't call one person each? And said they would do it immediately and come to a meeting that night. That night, thirteen people came, and the work group once again expressed their attitude. Everyone was very energetic, discussed the division of labor, and decided who would be responsible for mobilizing whom. The next night, when they held another meeting, sixty people came, and they elected their own temporary head (chairman). After fourteen days, they themselves connected and developed to more than two hundred and forty people.
　　2. Let the poor and hired peasants handle affairs freely and give full play to their abilities and wisdom. They know how to mobilize and organize their own team. For example, when poor peasants Zhang Guohai and Wang Faquan found Mi Guiniang, she said: "Doing this is not as good as carrying a burden! You can't do anything in the spring, haven't you seen what it was like in the past? Dividing the land and dividing some old bad land." They said: "This time Chairman Mao is leading us, telling us to form a poor peasant league and unite into one lump. This time we will be in power ourselves." Mi Guiniang then said: "Look at you silly, don't get lost, it won't work, I'm afraid I won't get any dog meat fruit." They patiently said again: "Don't be afraid, there are laws above, someone will take care of us." At this time, Mi Gui came back, and after the same mobilization, she joined them.
　　In the process of connecting, because the poor and hired peasants were just mobilized, there were occasional minor problems, but they would correct them immediately. For example, if an individual was mobilized improperly, and eight middle peasants were found to have been connected during the class investigation, they were explained to and comforted, and then they were allowed to withdraw. Another example is that when the temporary chairman and vice-chairman were elected at the poor and hired peasant meeting on the 13th, three days later, they proposed that the vice-chairman Wei Ziliu had previously been a puppet village chief, so when discussing the candidates for the poor peasant league committee, they voted him out. This shows that the poor and hired peasants have vision, but before they are thoroughly mobilized, they dare not boldly express their opinions.
　　3. It is necessary to first consolidate the unity of the middle peasants before resolutely fighting the landlords. In mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, simply emphasizing the poor and hired peasants, and not inspiring them to be the backbone to unite the middle peasants to be masters of their own affairs together, so on the day the poor peasant league was formally established, some of them demanded struggle. At this time, the work group guided everyone to compare strength, asking them that Penyao Village has 420 households and 1,800 people, and only 240 poor and hired peasants have been organized, are the rest all enemies? Further inspire them to unite the middle peasants, expand the team, and fight feudalism together. In this way, everyone said: "The middle peasants are scared," "As long as you say to unite the middle peasants, they will come in without being called." The next day, more than two hundred people were connected, and the work is continuing to be carried out.

　　沁阳盆窑村工作组　耐心发动贫雇
    【本报消息】沁阳二区盆窑村，在过去几次土改运动中，消灭封建不彻底，贫雇农没有翻透身，到现在还是地主富农干部掌握大权，贫苦农民受压制。全村共四百二十户，一千八百多人，二千五百二十余亩土地，穷人们大部靠做瓦盆贩瓦盆糊口。工作组旧历正月初十下去后，就直接找贫雇。开始他们对工作组还不放心，后经过再三考查，工作组又向他们表明态度，承认过去没给贫雇办事的错误，坚决替他们撑腰作主，才解除了他们的顾虑，整个贫雇阶层才轰动起来。从这一段工作中看出：
    一、必须坚决表明态度，才能取得贫雇信任，工作组来到盆窑村，就找到西沟一座破窑住下，里面一张破床，住着一个羊工的父亲。接着又访问了几户贫农，这些人都有顾虑，不敢大胆说话。羊工任全兴谈了一会就借口肚子痛走开了。又找到一个贫农妇女，她是一个不管事的妇女主席，从她嘴里听出贫雇不敢接近工作组的原因，是不知道这些人是来干啥的。第二天上午工作组就把从区上了解的六个老实农民找到破窑洞里谈话，了解了他们翻身没有翻透后，就向他们表示：“你们啥时候翻不透身，我们啥时不走，这次咱们穷人要组织贫农团，村里事要靠咱们贫农来办。你们提出害怕村干部，这个不要紧，上边有法令，谁来破坏咱们翻身谁就犯法”。经过了三四个钟头的讨论，才慢慢有了劲。他们说：“俺六个人不行呀”！问他们不行怎么干，他们说要串连人。问他们能叫几个，说一个人还不叫一个？并且说马上就干，晚上就来开会。当天晚上就来了十三个人，工作组再次表明态度，大家劲头很大，讨论了分工，决定了谁负责动员谁。第二天晚上再开会就来了六十个人，自己选出了临时办事的头头（主席），经过了十四天的时间，他们自己就串连发展到二百四十余人。
    二、放手让贫雇办事，发挥他们的能力智慧。他们是知道怎样动员组织自己的队伍的，如贫农张国海、王法全找到米贵娘时，她说：“干这还不如去挑担哩！一春天耽误啥也不能干，没见过去那个样，分地分点老坏地”。他们就说：“这会毛主席领导咱，叫咱成立贫农团，联成一圪塔，咱们这回要自己当权”。米贵娘接着就说：“看你个傻样，不要发迷瞪，可不行，那怕不得狗肉果实哩。”他们又耐心的说：“不怕，上头有法令，有人给咱作主”。这时米贵娘就说：“那可要捞摸真，捞摸不真可不敢”。说着米贵回来了，经过了同样的动员，她就随着参加了。
    在串连当中，因为贫雇刚发动，间或也有小毛病，但他们马上就会纠正。如有个别发动的不恰当，查阶级时查出串进来八个中农，向他们解释安慰后，就让他们退出去了。又如在十三日贫雇会时选出了临时的正副主席，隔了三天，他们提出副主席卫子六从前当过伪保长，于是在讨论贫农团委员候选人时，就把他选掉了。这说明贫雇是有眼光的，只是在未彻底发动起来前，还不敢大胆的提出意见。
    三、必先巩固团结中农，才能坚决斗争地主。在发动贫雇中单纯强调贫雇，没有启发他们自己为骨干团结中农一起当家作主，所以在贫农团正式成立的一天，其中有的就要求斗争。这时工作组就引导大家比力量，问他们盆窑村有四百二十户一千八百口人，贫雇才组织起二百四十人，剩下的是不是都是敌人？进一步启发他们团结中农，扩大队伍，一起斗封建。这样大家也都说：“中农正在害怕哩”，“只要说团结中农，不用叫就进来了”。第二天一下就串连了二百多人，工作正继续开展中。
