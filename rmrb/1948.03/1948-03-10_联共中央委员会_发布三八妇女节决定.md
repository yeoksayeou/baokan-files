Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 8th: Moscow Dispatch: The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) has issued a decision on the International Women's Day of March 8th. It begins by stating: This year, the Soviet working people are welcoming the International Women's Day of March 8th in a powerful political and labor upsurge. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Soviet women and the people of the whole country are jointly working to build a communist society. The Communist Party and the Soviet government have achieved complete political and economic equality for women, enabling women to fully develop their talents and creativity. The achievements of socialist construction over the past thirty years are inextricably linked to the active participation of women in all sectors of the Soviet national economy.

The decision, after pointing out the significant role and outstanding achievements of Soviet women in industry and agriculture, transportation, both before and during the war, and at the present time, states: Soviet women are actively developing the world's most advanced socialist culture. Women have become the main force of Soviet culture. Women account for 43 percent of experts who have received Soviet higher education. Tens of thousands of female scientists are engaged in various technical fields. More than two hundred women have been awarded Stalin Prizes for their outstanding achievements, new inventions, and new discoveries. More than two million women are engaged in education, educating young people with lofty ideals and a spirit of patriotism.

The actions of women in participating in the elections of local Soviets of Working People's Deputies prove the political maturity of women and their loyalty to the Lenin-Stalin Party. More than 480,000 of the best daughters of the Soviet people have been elected as representatives to local Soviets, 277 women are representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and 1,378 women are representatives to the Supreme Soviets of various Union Republics and Autonomous Republics. The participation of a large number of women in government work is one of the most important evidences proving the invincible strength of socialism.

The resolution continues: Children's education is the glorious social task of mothers. The Soviet state cares for mothers in every possible way, giving them great help. In 1947 alone, 10 billion rubles were used to subsidize mothers with many children, single mothers, and for women's and children's welfare undertakings. More than 2.2 million mothers have been awarded the "Order of Maternal Glory" and the title of "Exemplary Mother," and 25,000 mothers have been awarded the title of "Mother Heroine."

The achievements of the Soviet people in completely liberating women and absorbing a large number of women to actively participate in political, economic and cultural work, greatly inspire the exploited and enslaved women in the capitalist world to fight to eliminate capitalist oppression and to fight for political and economic liberation. The social status of working women in capitalist countries is the most oppressed of all oppressed social strata.

This year's commemoration of International Women's Day of March 8th is being carried out under the conditions of an increasingly serious general crisis of capitalism, under the conditions of the increasing decline of capitalist forces and the increasing strength of socialist and democratic forces, and under the conditions of the democratic camp's persistent struggle for the consolidation of lasting peace and against the instigators of a new war. A large number of women in capitalist and colonial countries have participated in the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle and the ranks of the democratic front.

The decision finally states forcefully: The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructs party organizations at all levels of the All-Union Communist Party to commemorate the International Women's Day of March 8th by mobilizing Soviet women to revive and further improve the national economy, and to complete and exceed the third year of the post-war five-year plan. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) reminds all levels of party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations that further enhancing the role of women in all sectors of society and the economy is one of the most important conditions for the victorious construction of communism. For the fundamental interests of the party and the people, it is necessary to boldly and resolutely promote advanced women to leadership positions in government, economic departments, party organizations, and trade unions. Party, government, and trade union organizations have a greater obligation to care for mothers, to provide them with daily assistance in raising the young generation of the Soviet Union, and to constantly improve the labor and living conditions of women, and to expand kindergartens, nurseries, maternity hospitals, and public canteens. Party organizations at all levels must continue to educate women in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, with the national self-esteem of the great socialist motherland, and to raise their communist awareness.

　　联共中央委员会
  　发布三八妇女节决定
    【新华社陕北八日电】莫斯科讯：联共（布）中央委员会顷发布三八国际妇女节决定。首称：今年苏联劳动人民在强大的政治和劳动高潮中迎接三八国际妇女节。在共产党领导下，苏联妇女和全国人民，正共同致力于建设共产主义社会。共产党与苏维埃政府已实现了妇女在政治上经济上的完全平等，使妇女得到全面发挥其才干和创造性的机会。三十年来社会主义建设的成绩，是与妇女之积极参加苏联国民经济各部门工作，具有不可分割的紧密关系的。
    决定在指出苏联妇女在战前和战时，以及在现时工农业、运输业中的重大作用和卓越成绩后，指出：苏联妇女积极发展世界最先进的社会主义文化。妇女已成为苏联文化的主力。在受过苏联高等教育的专家中，妇女占了百分之四十三。好几万女科学家从事各种技术工作。二百多名妇女，因为卓越的成就、新发明和新发现，而荣获斯大林奖金。二百万以上妇女从事教育工作，以崇高的理想与热爱祖国的精神，来教育青年。
    妇女们在参加地方劳动人民代表苏维埃的选举中的行动，证明妇女在政治上的成熟，和对列宁——斯大林党的忠诚。有四十八万余苏维埃人民最优秀的女儿，当选为地方苏维埃代表，有二百七十七个妇女是苏联最高苏维埃代表，有一千三百七十八个妇女是各加盟共和国及自治共和国最高苏维埃代表。广大妇女参加政府工作，是证明社会主义有不可战胜的力量的重大证据之一。
    决议继称：儿童教育是母亲的光荣的社会任务。苏联国家对母亲的关怀是无微不至的，给了她们以极大的帮助。仅在一九四七年，用以津贴儿女多的母亲、单身的母亲，以及用于妇女儿童福利事业的费用，就达一百亿卢布。有二百二十万个母亲被授予“光荣母亲”奖章和“模范母亲”的称号，同时还授予二万五千个母亲以“母亲英雄”的称号。
    苏维埃人民在完全解放妇女方面的成就，以及吸收广大妇女积极参加政治、经济与文化工作，大大鼓舞着资本主义世界中被剥削与被奴役的妇女，为消灭资本主义的压迫而斗争，为取得政治与经济上的解放而斗争。资本主义国家中的劳动妇女在社会上的地位，是一切被压迫的社会阶层中最受压迫的。
    今年纪念国际三八妇女节，是在资本主义总危机更加严重的条件下，在资本主义力量日益衰落，而社会主义及民主力量日益增强的条件下，是在民主阵营为巩固与持久的和平，反对新战争挑拨者而坚持斗争的情况下进行的。在资本主义与殖民地国家中的广大妇女，她们参加了反帝斗争的前列和民主阵线的队伍。
    决定最后力称：联共（布）中央指示联共党各级组织：在动员苏联妇女为复兴与更加提高国民经济，在完成与超过战后五年计划的第三年计划的口号下，来纪念国际三八妇女节。联共（布）中央提醒各级党、苏维埃、职工会和青年团的组织：更加提高妇女在社会与经济一切部门中所起的作用，是胜利建设共产主义的最重要条件之一。为了党和人民的基本利益，必须大胆而坚决地提拔先进的妇女在政府、经济部门、党组织和职工会中，担任领导职务。党、政府、职工会各组织有更加关心母亲的义务，对于她们抚养苏联年青一代，应给以日常的帮助，并应经常改善妇女的劳动和生活条件，扩充幼稚园、托儿所、产科医院、公共食堂。党的各级组织必须继续以苏维埃爱国主义精神，以伟大的社会主义祖国的民族自尊心，来教育妇女，提高她们的共产主义的觉悟性。
