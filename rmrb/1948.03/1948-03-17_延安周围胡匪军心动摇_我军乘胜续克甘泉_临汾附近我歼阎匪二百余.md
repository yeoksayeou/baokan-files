Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th: Our local troops recovered Ganquan County, 45 kilometers south of Yan'an, on the 5th. The defending enemy, a portion of the 144th Regiment of the Hu bandit 48th Brigade and the security police, abandoned the city and fled towards Yan'an, intimidated by the might of our army's offensive. This city was seized by the Hu bandits on March 17th last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th: After the great victory at Yichuan, the Chiang-Hu bandit army entrenched around Yan'an City was panicked and morale was wavering. The enemy in Lijiaqu and Yaodianzi, 30 to 50 li east of the city, hastily retreated to the Qiao'ergou area, 10 li from the city, on the 2nd of this month, and the enemy in Hezhuangping, 20 li north of the city, also fled to the Lanjia Ping and Yangjialing areas. On the 7th, nine members of the 1st Platoon and 2nd Squad of the Ansai puppet security police team stationed in Peizhuang, west of Yan'an, defected to our side with their weapons. The Hu bandits in Daguanzhong are also trembling with fear. Recently, trains and dozens of trucks on the Xianyang-Tongguan line of the Longhai Railway have been carrying the Chiang bandits' families and property south day and night to escape. The Hu bandit Provisional 2nd Brigade, entrenched along the Gouyi-Chishui line, has been transferred back to Xi'an overnight and is currently rushing to build fortifications day and night in the Fuping area, attempting to prolong its life. Prices in the Chiang-controlled areas have soared accordingly. In Yaoxian on the 4th and 5th, wheat rose from 270,000 Chiang currency per dou to 370,000, and cotton rose from 4.7 million to 6.7 million per 100 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 14th: On the 8th, a part of the local armed forces of Luliang annihilated parts of the Yan bandit Security 25th Regiment and the Reinforcement 2nd Regiment in Zhentou and Dongzhuang, more than 40 li west of Linfen, killing and capturing more than 200 enemy personnel below the battalion commander level, and seizing eight machine guns and 81 rifles. We suffered no casualties. In addition, the Yangqu County guerrillas raided Guankou, more than 30 li west of Taiyuan, on the 2nd, annihilating and capturing 60 members of the machine gun and artillery company of the Yan bandit Security 4th Regiment, and seizing two light cannons, four machine guns, and more than 30 rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 14th: On the 4th, the local armed forces of the 7th Military Sub-district repelled the Chiang bandit 11th Division 118th Brigade, which had invaded Wuyang City and Beiwudu. The enemy fled eastward in a panic. On the same day, another unit of local armed forces wiped out local Chiang bandits in the Fangcheng southwest area, killing 35 bandits, capturing 32 alive, seizing 30 long and short guns, and capturing five bunkers. The remaining bandits fled westward.
