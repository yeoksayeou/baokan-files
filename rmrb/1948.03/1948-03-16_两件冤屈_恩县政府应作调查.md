　　Two Grievances
  　En County Government Should Investigate

To the Editor:
    Recently, the newspaper has a special column called "Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Complain," which is really excellent. Everyone likes to read it, and they read every word without missing a single one. Indeed, no matter which comrade reads it, they say: "Oh! The poor peasants and hired laborers are really suffering. From now on, it is really not acceptable to not care about the poor peasants and hired laborers," and so on. Shouldn't the Jinnan Daily also be asked to publish things about poor peasants and hired laborers complaining? My opinion is that they should be told that as long as it reflects the problems of poor peasant and poor brothers, even if other newspapers don't have it, this one should.
    The comrades working at the grassroots level can't possibly finish talking about the suffering of the poor peasants and hired laborers, but before the Party rectification, because my class standpoint was not clear, although I knew that the poor were really in difficulty, and knew that the poor peasants and hired laborers were oppressed, I thought that this was the responsibility of the higher authorities, and I couldn't do anything about it, so I just let it be. This was my past thinking, and it was very wrong.
    Comrade Wang Yueting of Chengguan, En County, Jinnan Second District, has been working as a laborer since he was a teenager until he was over fifty years old. Needless to say, he suffered a lot. At the end of last year, he was very active in leading the poor to turn themselves around. He was promoted to work in the Third District and was very responsible. The county magistrate and county party committee all know this. The environment there is not good, and special agents are constantly killing people. The old man, with a broken gun, worked very hard. But once, a soldier from our front line nicknamed "Commander Leng" and several other people beat the old man, knocking out several of his teeth. The wound on his chest suppurated for a long time, but he still didn't stop working. I felt very sad when I saw it. The old man complained time and time again, but the county magistrate and the county party committee didn't care. What could we do?
    There is also a kiln worker who has been doing this work since he was a teenager. He has been burning kilns in En County for thirty years. He is still a poor man alone in his fifties. He is from Yongnian, and he is in the same trade as me. Before the liberation of En County, the anger of bandits, special agents, traitors, local bullies, kiln owners, and landlords was unspeakable. After liberation, the kiln owner was also a landlord and the former head of the traitorous organization. He changed the accounts and took the bricks. Not only did he not settle the debts owed, but he also threatened, "You are an outsider, if you want to sue, you won't live long..." The old man filed a complaint with the district and the county judicial section, but there has been no result for a year and a half. The old man is so angry that he is going crazy. These two things should be checked by the leaders of En County! (Xiao Song)

　　两件冤屈
  　恩县政府应作调查编辑同志：
    近来报上有一个专叫贫雇诉苦一栏，真是好极了，谁也很愿意看，并且一字不掉的看。的确，不管那个同志看了，都说：唉呀！贫雇真是痛苦，今后不关心贫雇，真是不行等等。是不是冀南日报也叫往上登贫雇诉苦告状的事呢？我的意见应当告诉他们，只要是为贫雇穷兄弟们反映问题，无的报也该有。
    在下边工作的同志，对贫雇痛苦简直说不完，可是未有整党前，我因阶级立场不明，虽知道穷人实是难，知道贫雇被压迫，但认为这是上级负责，咱管不了就算了，这是过去思想，是很不对的。
    冀南二分区恩县城关王月亭同志，从十几岁扛活一直到五十多了，胡子白长，受罪不用说，在去年年底，领导穷人翻身，很积极，提到三区工作，很负责，这个县长县委都知道。那个地方环境不好，特务不断的杀人，老头拿一个缺枪，干的很有劲。可是一次叫咱们前方一个外号叫“冷司令”的战士和好几个人，把老头打的牙掉好几个，胸前伤口好长时间流脓，还是不停止工作，我看了很难过，老头一次一次说，可是县长县委不管，咱有么法呢？
    还有个窑匠，从十几干这活，在恩县烧了三十来年窑，五十来岁还是穷汉子一个人，是永年人，和我是同行。恩县未解放前，受土匪、特务、汉奸、恶霸、窑主、地主的气无法说清；解放后，窑主又是地主，又是过去汉奸所长，把帐改了，把砖拉了，不但不算欠帐，并威胁说：“你是外来人，要打官司你活不长……。”老汉在区上和县司法科告了状，一年半了还没结果，老头气的疯疯傻傻的。这两件事，该叫恩县领导上检查检查吧！（嚣松）
