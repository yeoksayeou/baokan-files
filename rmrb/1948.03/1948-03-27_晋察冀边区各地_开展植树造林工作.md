Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, March 25th: The Border Region Administrative Committee recently issued instructions to governments at all levels to vigorously carry out afforestation work, stating: In order to prevent wind and floods, prepare timber for future construction, and help farmers become wealthy, governments at all levels should firmly grasp the leadership of this work this year. It is stipulated that all river beaches (except for sections to be dredged), mountain slopes, and all idle land (roadsides, next to houses, field edges, canal banks) should be mobilized for farmers to plant more trees and determine property rights in land distribution. The method of income distribution for publicly owned dikes and riverbanks shall be determined locally. Except for those needed for industrial or housing purposes, it is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily cut down existing trees. After felling, the original owner must be responsible for replanting the same number or more. All trees that have not yet matured are not allowed to be cut down. Advocate mountain maintenance and protection of restricted mountains. Encourage planting more elm and Chinese toon trees. Even on mountain slopes where trees cannot be planted, promote sowing of shrubby sophora and horsehair filiform, so as to obtain more firewood. Leaders in various places should promptly grasp and regulate the tree seedlings and seeds needed by farmers. New farmers' associations in various villages must lead farmers to formulate afforestation covenants and jointly abide by them. All rear-area agency school personnel should guarantee to help farmers plant and keep alive at least one tree per person. Individuals or villages with outstanding achievements in afforestation should be given appropriate rewards.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, March 25th: Shu Lu and Anping counties in central Hebei have begun planting trees and making forests. The Shu Lu Mazhuang Afforestation Committee mobilized more than one hundred men and women in the whole village to plant more than five hundred mu of poplar and jujube trees on the nearby sandy beach within two days. The South Zhizhuang New Farmers' Association called on liberated farmers to plant two trees alive as a memorial to liberation. In just two days, the entire village planted 230 trees. At the beginning of this month, Zhong Lizhuang in Anping mobilized villagers to plant more than 2,500 trees, and the villagers established a tree protection covenant. The Central Hebei Administrative Office has organized a work team to lead afforestation, planning to widely plant trees and make forests on both sides of the Shahe River, the Hutuo River, and the Cangshi Road.
