Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. News from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: The people in the Chiang-Fu controlled areas of Chahar Province are living in misery due to the traitor Fu Zuoyi's cruel exploitation of their blood and sweat as capital for his own promotion and fortune. According to recent admissions by the Fu Zuoyi authorities in Chahar Province, last year alone, in order to supply the Chiang-Fu troops in Northeast China, Baoding, Laishui, and other places with military grain, they plundered 70 million catties of miscellaneous grains from the people. In addition to exorbitant taxes and levies, and numerous corvée labor, the farmers' livestock, farm tools, and seeds were also mostly extorted, resulting in an increasing amount of abandoned land. The people in the Chiang-occupied areas of Hebei are also in dire straits under the trampling of the Chiang bandits. According to Chu Xichun, the Chiang bandit governor of Hebei Province, the burden on the people in the counties under his control exceeds 90% of their total income (each mu of land produces 140 catties of corn, but the assessed amount is nearly 130 catties). Furthermore, according to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on March 4th, in Jinghai County alone, there are dozens of Chiang bandit government organs such as the county government, county party headquarters, council, standing army, self-defense force, security police, police, and township and village offices, all of which levy grain from the people every month. Statistics show that the annual burden on the people is more than one stone of corn per mu, exceeding the total yield per mu. Moreover, if the people are slightly late in paying the burden, the Chiang bandit gang will commit barbaric acts. For example, last month, the Chiang bandit "self-defense corps" of Tongbai Township, District One, Wuqing County, extorted "contributions." When peddlers protested, the bandits opened fire with machine guns, killing one peddler and injuring four. In addition to collecting grain and money, the counties also levy labor, materials, laborers, and horse carts. Every time the Chiang bandit army transfers defenses, they dismantle and rebuild fortifications, forcing the people to bear the burden of labor and materials.

　　傅匪残暴压榨人民血汗
  　每亩地要缴一石玉茭
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：由于傅匪作义残暴压榨察省人民的血汗，作他升官发财的资本，察省蒋傅统治区民不聊生。据察省傅匪当局最近供认：去年仅为供给东北、保定、涞水等地蒋傅军军粮等项，即向民间掠夺杂粮七千万斤，加以苛杂、徭役浩繁，农民之耕畜、农具、种籽亦多被勒索一空，土地抛荒的日多。河北蒋占区人民在蒋匪蹂躏下，也处于水深火热中，据河北蒋匪省主席楚溪春供认，其治下各县人民负担均超过全部收入百分之九十（每亩地产玉米一百四十斤，但摊派则近一百三十斤）。另据三月四日天津益世报透露：静海一县蒋匪的县政府、县党部、参议会、常备队、自卫队、保警队、警察、乡、镇、村公所等机关就有几十个，都按月向老百姓摊派粮食，统计一年人民负担，每亩地要交玉米一石以上，竟超过每亩地全部产量。且人民交纳负担稍有迟误，蒋家匪帮即野蛮行凶，如武清第一区桐柏乡蒋匪“自卫团”上月勒索“摊捐”，摊贩反对，该匪竟用机枪扫射，摊贩惨死一名，伤四名。各县除征粮征款外，还要征工、征料、征夫、征马车。蒋匪军队调防一次，即将工事拆造一次，强迫人民担负劳役材料。
