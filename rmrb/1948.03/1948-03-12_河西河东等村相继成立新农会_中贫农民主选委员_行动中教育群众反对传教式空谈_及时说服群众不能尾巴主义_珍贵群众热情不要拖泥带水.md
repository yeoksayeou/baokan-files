　　[Our Newspaper Dispatches] Following the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League in Hexi Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, education on uniting with middle peasants was immediately carried out within the Poor Peasants' League. Using the Poor Peasants' League as the backbone, they connected with middle peasants to prepare for the establishment of a new Farmers' Association. During the process of connecting, it was discovered that many poor and hired peasants were using excessively high standards to demand of the middle peasants. They did not connect with middle peasants who had minor flaws (such as a bad attitude or difficulty in working together), and as a result, only thirty-some households were connected. After the work team discovered this closed-door tendency, they persuaded the poor and hired peasants, explaining the nature of the Farmers' Association. Finally, except for a few people with particularly serious problems who needed to be further investigated, all the other middle peasants were connected. On the evening of the 20th, a joint symposium of middle and poor peasants was held, with the Poor Peasants' League小组 as the unit. The main purpose was to review the members. Some middle peasants with problems made self-criticisms. For example, Zhang Jinguo said: "I have been very pessimistic these past two days because no one is looking for me, and I am not invited to meetings. My problem is that I am not good at labor and I waste things and don't know how to live frugally. As long as I am allowed to join the Farmers' Association, my problems will definitely be corrected, and everyone should also help me." Zhang Baozi also spoke about his past "selfishness" and how happy he was to be invited to join the Farmers' Association. Other middle peasants also spoke their true feelings. In the小组 meetings, everyone present generally spoke. Zhongnong Xizi said at the meeting: "The Poor Peasants' League and the New Farmers' Association are all brothers and sisters of one family, and we must unite well."

　　Another task during the preparation for the establishment of the New Farmers' Association was to eliminate the estrangement between the masses and the party members. Because when the masses gave their opinions to the party member cadres, some people (mainly cadres who had stepped down) had personal retaliatory emotions, which affected a part of the masses, blindly opposing the party members, regardless of the size of the problems of the party members and cadres, and even refusing to absorb their family members into the Farmers' Association. The work team considered at this time that if this blindness was not overcome, it would affect the unity among the peasants in the future. They immediately exposed the bad intentions of individual elements among the masses and let the masses repeatedly discuss: Could they turn over without the leadership of the Party in the past? Could feudalism be defeated? Can we completely turn over without the leadership of the Party in the future...? After such steps, the understanding of the masses was raised, and their understanding of the party member cadres also changed greatly. For example, Zhang Xizi proposed in the小组 discussion: "The size of the error should be viewed separately. It is not that if one party member cadre has an error, all of them have errors." After such a process, the masses approved a group of party member cadres to join the Farmers' Association.

　　The New Farmers' Association was officially established on the evening of the 21st. The masses were very concerned about this meeting and arrived at the venue very early. The chairman and the comrades of the work team spoke, particularly emphasizing that after the establishment of the New Farmers' Association, a new style of work must be established, and the bad style of the old cadres must be resolutely avoided. All those who join the Farmers' Association must conduct self-criticism regularly in the future, speak their minds at the meeting, and oppose speaking cold words after the meeting; if there is anything, everyone must discuss and find a solution together, and oppose any individual acting arbitrarily; no matter who has made a mistake, they can only reason and act according to the rules, and oppose random deductions and beatings; peasants must unite, and oppose picking and choosing. The nomination of candidates was very cautious, and almost everyone had to discuss whether he was good at labor and whether he was fair in his work, etc. (the masses attached great importance to these two points). As a result of the election, only two middle peasants were among the eleven committee members. The Poor Peasants' League Committee immediately proposed to withdraw two seats to give to the middle peasants. In this way, the middle peasants attending the meeting were greatly encouraged, and many people in the venue were discussing: "This is true democracy," "The middle and poor peasants are a family after all," and an atmosphere of excitement and unity filled the entire venue. The masses were very satisfied with the eleven committee members. They unanimously reflected: "This is the first time in Hexi that the selection of cadres was arranged by others in the past, but this time it was truly selected according to our own minds. The people selected are all old气人 supported by everyone, and future work will be done well."

　　There are several issues worth noting throughout the process of establishing the New Farmers' Association: First, educating the masses in action and improving the masses. The masses will not accept education that is separated from reality and is missionary or training-like. Secondly, after the poor and hired peasants have been mobilized, they should seize the opportunity to connect with the middle peasants to establish the New Farmers' Association, otherwise it will increase the anxiety of the middle peasants and isolate the poor and hired peasants; after the establishment of the Farmers' Association,小组 activities must be strengthened, and each meeting must have content. Major events in the village should be put into小组 for discussion, so that the masses can truly realize that they are the masters of their own affairs and can also educate and improve the masses. In addition, before the establishment of the Farmers' Association, the relationship between the Party and the masses must be initially improved, so that the masses have a correct understanding and assessment of the mistakes of party member cadres. If the masses are not persuaded and educated in time to overcome their blind emotions, it will not only cause disunity among the peasants, but also relax the leadership of the Party and form tailism. But this is by no means a cover-up for the mistakes of party member cadres. Their mistakes must be corrected, and they should be dealt with as they should be. However, it is wrong to refuse them all to participate in the Farmers' Association without distinction. On this issue, the leaders must be clear-headed and must grasp the principle of neither pouring cold water on the masses nor following behind the blind emotions of the masses.

　　[Our Newspaper Dispatches] The New Farmers' Associations have been established successively in the four villages of Tianerzhuang, Qingyan Temple, Hedong, and Shierzhuang in the Ninth District of Wu'an since the fifteenth day of the first month of the new year. The characteristics of the work in this period from the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League to the establishment of the New Farmers' Association are: First, firmly and clearly implement Chairman Mao's instructions: "Rely on the poor peasants and firmly unite with the middle peasants." After the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League in Tianerzhuang, the团员 of the Poor Peasants' League immediately discussed which middle peasants could join the Farmers' Association, and then solicited the opinions of the middle peasants separately. The next day, the first batch of Farmers' Association members were reviewed and approved at the大会 of the Poor Peasants' League. The Poor Peasants' League was unwilling to allow cadres who had not reflected well and the伯叔 brothers and sisters of the cadres to join the Farmers' Association. Later, they discussed why they were not allowed to join the Farmers' Association? What kind of風 could he follow after joining the Farmers' Association, and what were they afraid of? Not joining the Farmers' Association was to educate him, and he could still be educated after joining the association. After discussion, except for three cadres and one peasant who had serious mistakes (harboring landlords and attacking peasants) and had not reflected well, all 86 men and 48 women in the village joined the Farmers' Association. In Hedong, more than 200 people out of more than 500 people in the village joined the association. In the Farmers' Association Committee, the poor and middle peasants of Qingyan Temple each accounted for half, and Tianerzhuang had six poor peasants and five middle peasants. The second feature is the so-called "meticulous", "slow", and "not taking the lead" in the leadership style, which is actually divorced from the demands of the masses and the actual movement, and "holding" the masses to investigate over and over again according to the ideas of intellectuals, and educating the masses in a "training class" style. After the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League in Tianerzhuang, the middle peasant Yang Xian asked: "Shouldn't it be our turn yet?" The comrades of the work team insisted on holding a middle peasant symposium to understand the thoughts of the middle peasants and resolve the疙瘩. This delayed the time and increased the anxiety of the middle peasants. The Shierzhuang work team only solved the individual problems of the middle peasants. The middle peasants of Qingyan Temple said: "Establish the New Farmers' Association quickly!" Hedong did not establish the New Farmers' Association until yesterday (the 8th), ignoring the foundation of the masses' awakening in the old area, and "resolving疙瘩", "investigating", and "educating" away from the requirements of the middle and poor peasants to "establish the New Farmers' Association quickly" and "implement抽肥补瘦", which instead disappointed the masses. If the middle peasants were connected and reviewed in two or three days according to the method of the Poor Peasants' League, the middle peasants would be organized and educated, and the New Farmers' Association would be established. The comrades of the Shierzhuang work team said: "We wanted to be meticulous, so that everyone would have no opinion. We didn't know how to grab the big辫子, reversed the order of work, and took a small detour."

　　河西河东等村相继成立新农会
  　中贫农民主选委员
    行动中教育群众反对传教式空谈
    及时说服群众不能尾巴主义         
    珍贵群众热情不要拖泥带水
    【本报消息】武安九区河西村贫农团成立后，紧接着即在贫农团中进行团结中农的教育。并以贫农团为骨干，串连中农，准备成立新农会。在串连过程中，发现了有不少贫雇，以过高的标准去要求中农，稍有点毛病的中农（如态度不好、不好共事等），就不去串连，结果只串连了三十几户。工作组发现这种关门偏向后，又在贫雇中进行说服，说明农会性质，最后除了几个毛病特别大的人须要继续考查外，其余的中农都串连了。二十日晚上，以贫农团小组为单位，召开了中贫农联合座谈会，主要是审查会员，有些有毛病的中农，都做了自我批评，如张金桂谈：“这两天我很悲观，因为谁也不找我，开会也没我，我的毛病就是劳动不好，浪费不会过日子，只要叫我参加农会，我的毛病一定能改，大家也要帮助我。”张保子也谈出自己过去“自谋自利”，现在叫进农会很高兴；另外一些中农也都说了真心话。在各个小组会中，到会的人都普遍的发了言。中农喜子在会上表示：“贫农团、新农会，都是亲兄弟一家人，要好好团结”。
    在筹备成立新农会期间的另一个工作，即是消除群众与党员间的隔阂。因为在群众给党员干部提意见时，有些人（主要是下台干部）有个人报复情绪，影响了一部分群众，盲目的反对党员，对党员和干部不管毛病大小，甚至连其家属都拒绝吸收到农会。工作组在这时考虑到，这一盲目性如不加以克服，将会影响今后农民间的团结。当即首先在群众中揭露了个别分子的不良企图，并且让群众反复讨论，过去没有党的领导能不能翻身？能不能打垮封建？今后没有党的领导能不能彻底翻身……？经过这样的步骤后，群众的认识提高了，对党员干部的认识，也有很大的转变，如张喜子在小组讨论时提出：“错误大小要分开看，不是一个党员干部有错误就都有了错误。”经过这样的一些过程，群众通过了一批党员干部参加了农会。
    二十一日晚正式成立新农会，群众对这一个会非常的关心，很早就都到了会场。主席与工作组同志讲话，特别着重的提出新农会建立后一定要建立新作风，坚决不学过去旧干部的坏作风，凡参加农会的，以后要经常进行自我批评，有话要到会上讲，反对在会后说凉话；有事一定要大家商量想办法，反对任何个人独断专行；不管谁有错误，只能说理按规矩办事，反对随便扣、打；农民一定要团结，反对挑三拨四的。对候选人的提选很慎重，差不多都要讨论一下，看他是否劳动好，办事是否公道等（这两点群众十分重视）。选举结果十一个委员中只有两个中农，贫农团委员会当场提出退出两席，让给中农，这样一来与会的中农受了很大的鼓舞，会场中许多人在议论着：“这才是真正民主”，“中贫农到底是一家”，兴奋、团结的气氛充满了整个会场。十一个委员，群众都十分满意。一致反映：“这是河西第一遭，过去选干部是由别人布置，这次真正的依自己的心思选，选的都是大家拥护的老气人，以后的工作定能办好。”
    成立新农会的整个过程中，有几个问题值得注意的：首先是在行动中教育群众，提高群众，脱离开实际传教式的或训练式的教育，群众是不会接受的。其次是当贫雇农既经发动起来以后，就应当趁热打铁抓紧串连中农成立新农会，否则会使中农增加不安，也会使贫雇陷于孤立；农会成立以后，一定要加强小组活动，每次会都有内容，村里的大事，均应放到小组去讨论，这样会使群众真正能体会到当家做主，同时也能教育提高群众。此外，在成立农会前，一定要初步改善党群关系，使群众对党员干部的错误，有正确的认识与估计，如不及时说服教育群众，克服其盲目情绪，不但会使农民内部不团结，而且会放松党的领导，形成尾巴主义，但这绝不是对党员干部错误的包庇，他们错误一定要改，该怎办就怎办，但是不加区别的一律拒绝参加农会，那就是错误的。在这一问题上，领导者的头脑必须清醒，一定要掌握既不给群众泼冷水，也不能跟在群众盲目情绪后边跑。
    【本报消息】武安九区田二庄、青烟寺、河东、史二庄等四村，自新年正月十五日以来先后成立了新农会。从贫农团成立到新农会成立，这一时期工作的特点是：第一、坚定的明确的执行毛主席的指示：“依靠贫农、巩固地联合中农”。田二庄贫农团成立后，当天贫农团团员即讨论哪些中农可以入农会，然后分头征求中农意见，第二天即在贫农团大会上审查通过第一批农会会员，贫农团对于没有反省好的干部及干部的伯叔兄弟姊妹，都不愿他们入农会。后来他们自己讨论了为啥不让他入农会？入农会他能走什么风，怕什么？不入农会是为了教育他，入了会还可教育他。讨论以后，除三个干部一个农民错误既大（包庇地主，打击农民）反省又不好未入农会外，全村农民男八十六人，女四十八人全部入了农会。河东全村五百多人，入会者二百多人。农会委员中青烟寺贫农中农各占一半，田二庄贫农六人，中农五人。第二个特点是领导作风上的所谓“细致”“慢”、“不抢先”，实际上是脱离群众要求与实际运动，按照知识分子的一套想法，“拿着”群众调查过来调查过去，“开训练班”式的教育群众。田二庄贫农团成立后，中农杨显问：“还不该着我们哩吗？”工作组的同志偏要开个中农座谈会，了解了解中农的思想，解解疙瘩。延迟了时间，增加了中农的不安。史二庄工作组只解决了中农的个别问题。青烟寺中农说：“快点成立新农会吧！”河东直到昨天（八日）才成立了新农会，忽视了老区群众的觉悟基础，离开中农与贫农“迅速成立新农会”“实行抽肥补瘦”的要求去“解疙瘩”，“调查”，“教育”，而反使群众失望。如果按照贫农团的办法两三天的时间即可串连与审查了中农，即组织了与教育了中农，成立了新农会。史二庄工作组同志说：“我们想细致，使每个人无意见，不知抓大辫子，颠倒了工作次序，走了个小小的弯路”。
