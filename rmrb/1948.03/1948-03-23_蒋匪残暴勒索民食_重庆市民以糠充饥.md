Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th – According to various sources, the Chiang bandits are intensifying their plunder of civilian food supplies, creating a rice shortage. Last year, the Chiang bandits in Jiangsu province additionally levied so-called "surtax grain" of 500,000 shi (石), and Hunan, which had originally planned to "collect grain" of 2.7 million shi, is now collecting "land tax," requisitioning "land tax surtax grain" and "reserve grain" of 8.1 million shi, totaling 10.8 million shi, which has exceeded the heaviest burden during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Moreover, Chiang bandit local governments also extort heavily during grain collection, illegally increasing the amount and pocketing the difference. Among them, the "land tax surtax grain" is an additional extortion carried out by the Chiang bandits after the civil war, and in many provinces it has exceeded the "land tax quota." For example, in Jiangdu (i.e., Yangzhou), Jiangsu Province, the "land tax" is two dou (斗) per mu (亩), while the "surtax grain" reaches two dou and seven sheng (升). The Chiang family’s Chen brothers' "China Grain Company" and Chiang Kai-shek and the Chen brothers' joint "China Farmers Bank" are forcibly purchasing grain at low prices in Wuhu, Nanchang, and other grain distribution centers. The "China Grain Company" alone has recently collected more than 7,100 large packages in Nanchang. In the second half of last year, the Chiang bandit authorities purchased military rice in large quantities throughout Jiangsu, paying a low price of only 174,000 yuan per shi, and the grain payment was not issued until the beginning of this year, by which time the grain price had increased more than tenfold. In the Yanbei area of Shanxi occupied by the Chiang bandits, the people suffered losses of 15 billion yuan due to the Chiang bandits' "purchase" of military rice. The people are unable to survive and are abandoning their farmland and fleeing with their families.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th – According to a late dispatch from Chongqing: Due to the insane plunder of military grain by the Chiang bandit Food Department, the rice shortage in Chongqing, the capital of the so-called "Land of Abundance," is becoming increasingly serious. In mid-January, the price of rice per dan (担) had already risen from 820,000 yuan to nearly one million yuan. Since then, the rice market has become increasingly chaotic and continues to rise. The vast majority of citizens can no longer afford to buy white rice and are instead buying bran rice and wheat bran to fill their stomachs (the price of one jin (斤) of rice can buy five or six jin of bran or wheat bran), resulting in thriving bran shops, which are crowded and congested, but subsequently prices rise and goods become scarce. Chiang bandit Mayor Zhang Dulun also admitted that "the rise in grain prices is entirely due to the Food Department's purchases," but begged "reporters not to stimulate people's hearts when reporting this news," attempting to cover up the truth. Ship after ship, manned by voracious Chiang bandit Food Department personnel, carrying grain, continuously sail downstream, and the citizens are filled with resentment and curse the Chiang family bandit gang.

      蒋匪残暴勒索民食
      重庆市民以糠充饥
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据各方消息：蒋匪加紧掠夺民食，制造米荒。江苏蒋匪于去年又加征所谓“田赋附加谷”五十万石，湖南原定“征粮”二百七十万石，现又征收“田赋”，征借“田赋附加谷”及“积谷”等八百一十万石，合计达一千零八十万石，已超过抗战时最重的负担。且蒋匪地方政府征粮时还大量勒索，浮收中饱。其中“田赋附加谷”为内战后蒋匪进行的额外勒索，在各省多已超过“田赋正额”。例如江苏省江都（即扬州），“田赋”每亩为二斗，“附加谷”即达二斗七升。蒋匪二陈家族的“中国粮食公司”及蒋介石与二陈合伙的“中国农民银行”更在食粮集散地芜湖、南昌等地强行低价收购食粮，仅“中粮公司”近即在南昌收去七千一百余大包。去年下半年蒋匪当局曾于江苏各地大批收购军米，每石仅给十七万四千元之低价，而粮款则迟至今年初才发给，粮价距当时已涨出十余倍。山西雁北蒋占区人民因蒋匪“收购”军米，损失达一百五十亿元。人民均不堪活命，纷纷抛弃耕地，全家逃亡。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据迟到重庆通讯：由于蒋匪粮食部疯狂掠夺军粮，已使所谓“天府之国”首府重庆的米荒愈演愈烈。一月中米价每担即已由八十二万涨至逼近百万大关，此后米市场即日趋混乱，不断上涨。广大市民均已无力购食白米，改买糠米、麦麸充饥（每斤米价可买糠或麸五、六斤），致糠麸铺生意兴隆，拥塞不堪，但继亦随之价涨货缺。蒋匪市长张笃伦亦供认“粮价的上涨，全是因为粮食部的采购”，但哀求“记者们在报导此项新闻时，千万不可刺激人心”，妄图掩饰。长江上一艘一艘由如虎如狼的蒋匪粮食部人员押运的运粮船，源源驶向下游，市民均愤恨咒骂蒋家匪帮。
