　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Destroy Jiangsu Dam
  　Juancheng Masses are Repairing it
    [This Dispatch from Yilu豫 Tenth of the Month]: (Delayed) Chiang Kai-shek bandits have once again destroyed the Jiangsu Dam hazardous section in Juancheng. On the afternoon of February 23rd, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 5th Reorganized Division's Provisional Rapid Column, with more than twenty vehicles and ten armored vehicles, occupied the Jiangsu Dam hazardous construction site in Juancheng, and stationed at Linpu 集 that evening. The next day (24th), the enemy dismantled the ice-breaker pile rows (used for winter ice block prevention, each row being one zhang two in length, bundled with eight wooden stakes) on the No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 dams at Longmen 口 (four li away from Linpu 集) and scattered them into the river to flow eastwards. Fortunately, our local river defense militia launched an attack and dispersed the enemy. More than eighty rows of ice-breaker piles were overturned into the river. On the same day, another enemy unit at Xiaoyanglou 小杨楼 above Longmen 口 transported more than 40,000 jin of straw material used for our dam repair, and set fire to more than one million jin of the remaining straw material. Fortunately, nearby masses rushed to rescue and put out the fire, burning 60,000 jin of straw material. On the night of the 25th, the enemy further destroyed the dam revetments. Just as the large current was directly impacting the New No. 2 Dam, creating a very dangerous situation, the enemy cut off all seventy large stake ropes (each rope weighing thirty jin, totaling more than two thousand jin) from the old and new No. 2 Dams. After the enemy's destruction, they retreated. That night, both dams subsided. At the junction revetment of the Old No. 2 Dam, four sections, each approximately 30 meters long, subsided by three meters; the flood directly scoured the base of the Old No. 2 Dam, posing an imminent danger. On the 26th, all engineering personnel in Juancheng and hundreds of masses near the Jiangsu Dam launched a surprise rescue effort, and are currently repairing the damage. Note: Jiangsu Dam is one of the largest hazardous works. Last July, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Liu Ruming's 68th Division's two regiments and the 1st Cavalry Brigade's one regiment invaded the Jiangsu Dam, damaging the hazardous section's pile wood in three places, and more than one zhang of the pile dike, creating an extremely critical situation. Later, our river defense units bravely repelled the enemy and quickly assisted the local people in blocking and restoring the damage, fortunately averting a major disaster. Furthermore, after we recovered Juancheng in August, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits instigated special agents to sabotage the Jiangsu Dam hazardous works. According to the confession of special agents Wang Yeshan 王野山 and Zhao Zhongju 赵中巨 captured by our Juancheng 8th District Zhao Village militia company, they cut ropes at the bottom of the Jiangsu Dam three times. By November, due to the large current directly impacting the root of the Old No. 2 Dam's embankment, our Juancheng engineering team, in order to prevent the embankment from collapsing and causing danger, mobilized laborers to build an outer embankment (New No. 2 Dam) more than one hundred meters long between the No. 1 and No. 2 Dams.

　　蒋匪破坏江苏坝
  　鄄城群众正抢修中
    【本报翼鲁豫十日电】（迟到）蒋匪再次破坏我鄄城江苏坝险工。二月廿三日下午，蒋匪整五师暂编快速纵队汽车二十余辆及装甲车十辆，进占我鄄城江苏坝险工地，当晚驻于临濮集。次日（二十四日）敌即在龙门口（距临濮集四里地）将险工二、三、四、五坝上的凌排桩（冬季防冰块用的，每排长一仗二，以木桩八根捆成）掀散到河里顺水东流，幸得我当地河防民兵出击，将敌击散。计被掀到河内凌排桩八十余排。同日，该敌另一部在龙门口上小杨楼运走我修坝的秸料四万余斤，并将其余的秸料百多万斤放火烧毁，幸经附近群众前去抢救，把火扑灭，烧去秸料六万斤。二十五日晚，敌更进一步破坏坝埽，正当大流直冲新二坝非常危险之际，敌将新老二坝大捞桩绳七十条（每条三十斤，共两千余斤）全部割去，敌破坏后即退去。当夜两坝皆下垫，老二坝接口埽四段长约三十公尺，下垫三公尺；洪水直刷老二坝根，形将出险。二十六日，我鄄城全体工程人员和江苏坝附近群众数百人突击抢险，现正在抢修中。按：江苏坝为最大险工之一，去年七月蒋匪刘汝明六十八师两个团与骑一旅一个团，曾进犯江苏坝，将险工排木破坏三处，排堤一仗余，形势异常危急，后经我河防部奋勇将敌击退，并迅速协助当地人民堵复，幸未酿成巨灾。又八月我收复鄄城后，蒋匪嗾使特务破坏江苏坝险工。据我鄄城民兵连在鄄城八区赵庄捕获之特务王野山、赵中巨供认在江苏坝底割绳三次。至十一月，由于大流直冲老二坝堤根，我鄄城工程队为预防堤坍出险，乃动员民工在一、二坝间增筑长达百余公尺的外堤（新二坝）。
