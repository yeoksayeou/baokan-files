　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th -- Comprehensive report: The education crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas has been profoundly exposed before and after the spring semester. Amidst soaring prices in the Chiang-controlled areas, private schools everywhere are vying to increase tuition fees. This semester, tuition and miscellaneous fees for private universities in Shanghai have reached as high as seven or eight million yuan (Chiang currency, same below), high schools four million yuan, and junior high schools two million to three million yuan. Private schools in Jinan have switched to collecting flour, with universities and specialized schools collecting five to seven bags, high schools three and a half to four bags, and junior high schools two to two and a half bags (each bag worth 1.2 million yuan). In Beijing and Tianjin, universities charge three million to four and a half million, middle schools two million to three million, and even primary schools start at a minimum of 1.2 million yuan. Increased tuition fees have forced a large number of students to drop out of school. Newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin carry student aid and job search advertisements daily in their social services columns. One student said in the student life column of a Beijing newspaper: "Looking at the current situation, I'm afraid nine out of ten people can't afford to send their children to school."

　　Students who have dropped out of school are wandering the streets, and even those who are fortunate enough to continue their studies are suffering. Students in schools in Beijing and Tianjin commonly suffer from lung disease, stomach problems, anemia, night blindness, and malnutrition. Forty percent of the students at Sino-French University cannot afford their meals at all. Seven out of eight dining groups at Chaoyang University eat corn buns, and hundreds of self-catering students live on cornmeal or watery gruel with salt. Even Yenching University, known as a "school for the elite," had 309 students requesting relief funds this semester, an increase of 174 from last semester. One female student at the school secretly went to Zhonghe Hospital to sell blood last semester because she could not afford her meals. In Jinan last semester, some students pawned their cotton-padded clothes in the dead of winter due to hunger, and female students at the Second Provisional Middle School were even forced into prostitution. In Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other places, some students combined two meals into one, filling up on sweet potatoes, while others were forced to do hard labor and repair roads to make a living.

　　Because the Chiang bandits use almost all of the wealth extracted from the people for the counter-revolutionary civil war, the funding for schools in the Chiang-controlled areas is invariably insufficient. Peking University's funding for January this year was 220 million yuan, but the cost of water and electricity alone reached over 300 million yuan. This year, student public expenses require 3 billion yuan, but the Chiang bandit Ministry of Education only approved 1.4 billion yuan. The school has already borrowed over 10 billion yuan. Even Hu Shih, the slave favored by Chiang and the United States, had to lament that "the funding given by the (Chiang bandit) Ministry of Education is not enough to pay the monthly interest." Tsinghua University received a total of 380 million yuan in funding last December, but electricity alone cost 240 million yuan. Private schools are even more miserable. Sino-French University budgeted 900 million yuan last semester, but actually spent 1.6 billion yuan, and the difference has yet to be resolved. Of the more than 400 middle schools in the Chiang-controlled area of Henan, more than 250 have been closed. In Yantai, occupied by the Chiang bandits, the funding and salaries for more than 20 public and private schools cannot be resolved, in stark contrast to the developed education and sufficient funding under the democratic government.

　　With skyrocketing prices and continuously shrinking real income, the educational community in the Chiang-controlled areas is struggling on the brink of starvation. Last semester, the highest salary for professors at Chaoyang University was 3.75 million yuan, and the lowest was 1.2 million yuan. Wang Tongling, a famous professor of Chinese general history, and his family of five are living by selling off their possessions, and they can no longer make ends meet. The miserable lives of primary and secondary school teachers go without saying.

　　Amidst hunger, cold, and being forced to drop out of school, the anti-hunger struggle of teachers and students in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas to fight for full public funding and improved treatment is developing day by day. Following the call for full public funding by universities such as Peiyang, Tangshan, and Nankai, and the three-day strike by Wuhan University for this reason in late January, the student unions of Beijing and Shanghai called on students of major middle schools in mid-February to resist paying tuition fees and fight for full public funding. Students from the judicial groups of eight universities, including Chaoyang, Fudan, Tongji, Wuhan, Central, Hunan, Guangxi, and Sichuan, each sent two representatives to Nanjing on the 20th of last month to form a joint petition group to fight for full public funding for judicial group students. The declaration issued by the group pointed out that students in the Chiang-controlled areas "have reached the extreme of suffering." Chaoyang, Yenching, and Sino-French universities in Beijing jointly hosted reporters on the 18th of last month, putting forward reasonable demands such as increasing regular funding for public schools and the treatment of faculty and staff, increasing the number of publicly funded places, establishing scholarships and increasing subsidies for private schools, distributing supplies to faculty and staff, and establishing scholarships and subsidies for middle schools. They accused that under the rule of the Chiang bandits, "any private school is currently struggling in hunger and poverty, and the suffering is beyond what outsiders can imagine."

　　蒋匪财政全部用于内战
    物价高涨教育危机日见加深　
    学生流浪街头教授无法温饱
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：蒋管区教育危机，在春季开课前后深刻暴露。在蒋区物价高涨中，各地私立学校竞相增加学费。本学期上海各私立大学学杂费已高达七、八百万元（蒋币，以下同），高中四百万元，初中二百万至三百余万。济南私立学校改收面粉，大学及专门学校收五袋至七袋，高中三袋半至四袋，初中两袋至两袋半（每袋一百二十万元）。平、津两地大学收费三百万至四百五十万，中学二百万至三百余万，即小学亦从一百二十万元起码。学费增加已迫使大量学生失学。平、津等地报纸社会服务栏，每日刊载着学生求助和求职的启事。一个学生在北平报纸的学生生活栏上说：“照目前情形看，怕十个人中有九个人无力供给儿女上学”。
    失学的学生正彷徨街头，即幸能维持学业的学生亦因苦不堪。平、津各校学生普遍患着肺病、胃病、贫血、夜盲症和营养不良。中法大学全校学生中有百分之四十完全交不起膳费。朝阳大学八个膳团中七个吃窝窝头，数百自炊学生吃玉米面或浆糊加盐水过日子。向以“贵族学校”见称的燕大，本学期请求救济金的学生三百零九人，比上学期增加一百七十四人。该校一女学生上学期因交不出膳费，暗赴中和医院卖血。济南学生上学期隆冬中，有因饥饿而典卖棉衣者，第二临时中学女生，甚至被迫操暗娼生涯。开封、郑州等地，有些两餐并一顿，以红薯充饥，有些则被迫做苦工、修马路维持生活。
    由于蒋匪以榨取人民膏血所得几全部用于反革命内战，蒋区各校经费无不支绌。北大今年一月份经费为二亿二千万元，但仅水电两项支出即达三亿元以上。今年学生公费需三十亿，但蒋匪教育部仅核准十四亿。该校向外借债已在一百亿元以上。连蒋美宠爱的奴才胡适，也不得不慨叹说：“（蒋匪）教育部所给的经费，不够每月付利息。”清华去年十二月共领到经费三亿八千万元，仅电费一项即用去二亿四千万元。私立院校更形凄惨，中法上学期预算九亿元，实支十六亿元，差额至今仍无法解决。河南蒋区四百余所中学中，已有二百五十余所停办。蒋匪侵占下的烟台，二十余所公私立学校经费及薪饷无法解决，与民主政府统治下教育发达经费充足成明显对照。
    在物价高涨实际收入不断缩减下，蒋区教育界挣扎于饥寒线上。朝阳上学期教授待遇最高为三百七十五万元，最低为一百二十万元。教中国通史名教授王桐龄一家五口，全靠当卖度日，现已无法维持，中小学教员生活的惨苦更不用说。
    在饥饿、寒冷与失学交迫中，蒋区各地师生争取全面公费与提高待遇的反饥饿斗争正日益发展。继北洋、唐山、南开等大学提出争取全面公费口号及一月下旬武大因此而罢课三天后，北平、上海两地学联已于上月中旬号召各大中学学生抗缴学费及争取全面公费。朝阳、复旦、同济、武汉、中央、湖南、广西、四川八大学司法组学生，上月二十日各推派代表二人抵南京，组成联合请愿团，争取司法组学生全部公费，该团所发表的宣言中指出蒋区学生“痛苦已达极点”。北平朝阳、燕京、中法三大学上月十八日联合招待记者，提出公立院校提高学校经常费与教职员待遇、增加公费名额，私立院校增设奖学金、增加补助费、教职员配发实物，及中学设置奖学金及补助费等合理要求。他们控诉在蒋匪统治下“目前任何一个私立学校都挣扎在饥寒贫困中，痛苦情形实非外人所能想象。”
