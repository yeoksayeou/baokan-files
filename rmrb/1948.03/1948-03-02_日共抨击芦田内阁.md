Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 28th: Tokyo dispatch: Eleven days after the fall of the Japanese Katayama Cabinet, the reactionary Democratic Party President Hitoshi Ashida, with the support of MacArthur, succeeded in forming a new cabinet on the 21st. After Ashida took office as Prime Minister, the MacArthur Headquarters government group immediately issued a statement expressing its approval, stating that Ashida was "well-loved by the Allied Headquarters." The Japanese Communist Party parliamentary group issued a statement saying: "Like the previous cabinet, the Ashida cabinet will not be able to cope with Japan's crisis and improve the people's living standards. The new cabinet will only more fiercely pursue policies that conform to the interests of monopoly capital than the Katayama cabinet." The JCP's newspaper, Akahata, criticized on the 26th: "Ashida's appointment as Prime Minister will attempt to transfer all burdens onto the masses and consolidate the control of monopoly capital, but this cabinet will be short-lived, because the working people will give the new cabinet a counterattack, just as they did to the former Katayama cabinet." It is noted that Ashida was the Foreign Minister in the Katayama Cabinet and once arrogantly demanded the return of islands acquired through Japanese aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 28th: Shanghai dispatch: According to the Millard's Review, MacArthur "has apparently received permission from the US government and is now engaged in formulating various plans to restore Japan as the leading power in the Far East." The magazine pointed out that reports from Japanese newspapers once again revealed that US imperialism has occupied many Japanese military bases. The magazine pointed out: "If people fly over the islands once used by the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor, they will be able to see that some former Japanese airfields are already being, or are in the process of being, repaired and expanded. If Japan is not allowed to have military or civilian aircraft, then what is the purpose of repairing these airfields?" The magazine also stated: "The US occupation authorities are restoring old Japanese institutions in order to maintain the 'law and order' needed by the American occupiers." *

　　日共抨击芦田内阁
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】东京讯：日本片山内阁倒台十一天后，反动的民主党总裁芦田均，已于二十一日在麦克阿瑟支持下继起组阁。芦田出任首相后，麦克阿瑟总部政府组立即发表声明，表示赞同，并称芦田“很受盟军总部的爱护”。日本共产党议会党团为此发表声明说：“正如前内阁一样，芦田新阁将不能应付日本的危机和提高人民的生活水准。新阁将只会比片山内阁更猛烈地奉行合于独占资本利益的政策。”日共机关报赤旗报二十六日抨称：“芦田之出任首相，将力图把一切负担转嫁到人民大众身上，并且巩固独占资本的控制，但这一内阁必将是短命的，因为劳动人民将给新内阁以反击，正如他们对前任片山内阁一样。”按芦田为片山内阁时之外相，曾狂妄要求收回日本侵略得来的岛屿。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】上海讯：据密勒氏评论报透露：麦克阿瑟“显然得到了美政府的允许，现已从事制定恢复日本为远东首屈一指的强国的各种计划”。该杂志指出，来自日本的报纸报导再次透露：美帝国主义已占领了许多日本的军事基地。该杂志指出：假使人们飞过曾被日人用以进攻珍珠港的岛屿，就能够看到某些以前的日本飞机场，已经或者正在被修复和扩大着，假使不允许日本拥有军用飞机或民用飞机，那末修复这些飞机场的目的何在呢？”该杂志又称：美国占领当局正在恢复日本旧机构，以图保持美国占领者所需要的“法律和秩序”。＊
