　　Northeast Fourth Largest City - Yongji

　　Jilin, also known as Yongji, is the capital of Jilin Province. Located in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, it is the gateway to eastern Manchuria and the fourth largest city in Northeast China, with a population of approximately 260,000. Since the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive last year, it has been completely isolated. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits diverted the Songhua River to build a moat, attempting to hold it firmly. This time, it was finally recovered by us, and the most prominent stronghold of Chiang's bandits in eastern Manchuria was removed.

　　In 1937, the Japanese invaders built the so-called "world-shaking" Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant here. After five years of construction, it began to transmit electricity in 1943. It was connected to Jingbo Lake, Fuxin, Xi'an, Fushun, and Anshan, forming a huge power grid with southern Manchuria. The most important cities in Northeast China, such as Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang, as well as important heavy industrial areas such as Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun, and light and heavy industrial cities in northern Manchuria, are directly supplied with electricity from Xiaofengman. The plant has four generators with a power generation capacity of 280,000 kilowatts.

　　Since the construction of the Xiaofengman Power Plant, Jilin has become a heavy industrial city: cement, synthetic petroleum, electrochemistry, carbon, special paper making, shipbuilding... are all very developed, while light industries include matches, phosphorus production, and flax. The area is also rich in mandarin fish and grass carp.

　　Jilin has beautiful scenery and is known by the local residents as "the best landscape in the world." Transportation is extremely developed, with the Jilin-Changchun Railway, Jilin-Lafa Railway, and Jilin-Shenyang Railway connecting here, reaching Tumen in the east, Harbin in the north, Changchun in the west, and connecting with Shenyang and Tonghua in the south. Steamships can sail directly to Harbin via waterway.

　　东北第四大城—永吉
    吉林又名永吉，是吉林省的省会，位于松花江上游，为东满的门户，是东北第四个大城，人口约二十六万。自解放军去年秋季攻势以来，即被完全孤立，蒋匪曾引松花江水灌筑护城河，企图固守，此次终被我收复，蒋匪在东满最突出的一个强固据点乃被拔除。
    一九三七年日寇在此建筑所谓“震撼世界”的小丰满水力发电厂，经过五年工程，至一九四三年开始送电，与镜泊湖、阜新、西安、抚顺、鞍山联系，接成与南满巨大送电网，东北最重要的城市，如哈尔滨、长春、沈阳及重要重工业地带，如鞍山、本溪、抚顺及北满轻重工业城市，均由小丰满直接供给电力。该厂有四座发电机，发电二十八万基罗瓦特。
    自小丰满发电所构筑成功后，吉林便一跃而为重工业城市：洋灰、人造石油、电气化学、炭素、特殊制纸、修船……等俱极发达，轻工业则有火柴、制磷、亚麻等。当地并盛产鳜鱼草根鱼等。
    吉林景色秀丽，当地居民有“天下第一江山”之称。交通极发达，有吉长（春）、吉拉（法）、吉沈（阳）三条铁路在此衔接，东通图门，北达哈尔滨，西抵长春，南与沈阳、通化相贯通。水运汽船可直驶哈市。
