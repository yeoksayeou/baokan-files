Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th. Under the slogan of "Production Strives to Support the Front Lines," the workers' movement in Harbin is flourishing. Under the leadership of the General Trade Union, workers in various public and private enterprises enthusiastically discussed Chairman Mao's report "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" and the Xinhua News Agency's "February 7th" editorial. After discussion, the private Xiehe Iron Factory held several joint meetings with workers and capitalists. Both parties unanimously responded by accepting military production and studied how to improve quality. A plan was formulated on the first of this month to launch a production merit campaign. Currently, 5,000 workers from private enterprises are participating in military production. According to the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, workers in various private enterprises have voluntarily requested lower dividends for those that previously had higher dividends. In municipal enterprises, where the workers' movement has a more solid foundation, 3,000 workers have universally launched a production merit campaign. Workers in the power plant's motor repair team voluntarily extended their working hours to more than ten hours to ensure uninterrupted power supply. The tram factory has completed its task of producing three new trams per month and reduced the incidence of driving failures by 20%. In the movement, four specific problems were also solved: (1) Due to the recording and evaluation of merits, cadres were prompted to study technology, and production was given specific standards. (2) Due to everyone formulating plans and organizations formulating plans, production, which in the past was somewhat blind, has entered planned production. (3) Due to mass-based recording and evaluation of merits, the relative strength and weakness of each person's labor became clearer, solving the difficulty of evaluating wages in the past. (4) Attention has begun to be paid to technical learning and creation.

In the city, more than 300 public factories belonging to six systems mostly had no trade union organizations in the past. This time, after the General Trade Union called for it, many factories have established trade unions. Another seventy factories have contacted the General Trade Union. The General Trade Union, focusing on production merit to support the war, has also carried out various other tasks. The Welfare Department established a workers' cooperative to supply low-priced goods, registered more than 1,000 unemployed workers, helped introduce employment, and is planning to establish a workers' hospital. The Workers' Propaganda Department has established three workers' clubs and plans to establish a workers' literary and art troupe to strengthen workers' after-school education. The workers' middle school for training worker cadres has been formally established, and a short-term training class of 500 people also opened a few days ago. The Women Workers' Department organized the Mao Zedong Youth League. In addition, the shop assistants' union was launched to help with tax investigations and mobilize more than 200 car drivers to go to the front to serve the war.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th. Zhong Ziyun, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee, recently elaborated on the urban mass movement policy at a cadres' meeting. He said: In the past three years, Harbin has basically defeated the enemy's puppet political and economic organizational system. Today, Harbin's basic task is to "increase production and prosper the economy." He called on all cadres to mobilize and organize the vast number of workers in public and private factories to make contributions to the country in production. In private factories, he called on workers to develop production under the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital. He pointed out that various disputes between labor and capital should be resolved through arbitration and mediation, so that both labor and capital can unite in production under the principle of mutual benefit. As for the most heinous and evil elements, they can be dealt with through the People's Court or public trial meetings, and their property must be decided by the municipal government. He also proposed to rectify worker and merchant organizations, correct the style of some cadres being divorced from workers and the vast masses of other classes, and improve workers' cultural, political, and technical level and business experience. At the same time, strengthen the unity between young workers and older workers, ordinary workers and technical workers within the workers, so that they can help each other learn and work together to produce. Leading comrades in each district should work in typical factories, establish normal and reasonable labor-capital relations in factories and shops, and work together to develop production and prosper the economy.

　　生产立功支援前线
  　哈市职工运动蓬勃发展
    三百余家公营工厂已建立工会
    【新华社东北十八日电】哈尔滨市职工运动在生产立功支援前线的口号下，蓬勃发展，各公私企业的职工在总工会领导下热烈讨论了毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”报告及新华社“二七”社论。私营协和铁工厂在讨论后，工人和资方开了几次联席会议，双方一致响应接受军工生产，并研究如何提高质量，于本月一日订出计划，开展生产立功运动。现各私营企业参加军工生产的工人已有五千人。各私营企业工人根据劳资两利方针，凡过去分红较多的，现已自动要求降低。在职工运动较有基础的市政企业中，三千职工已普遍开展生产立功运动，发电厂电机修理组工人自动延长工作时间在十小时以上，保证不停电。电车厂已完成月出三辆新车的任务，并减少行车故障现象百分之二十。在运动中，并解决了四个具体问题：（一）由于记功评功，促使干部钻研技术，并使生产有了具体标准。（二）由于人人订计划，组织订计划，使过去多少带有盲目性的生产，进入有计划的生产。（三）由于群众性的记功评功，每个人劳动强弱比较清楚，解决了过去评定工资的困难。（四）开始注重了技术上的学习与创造。
    全市属于六个系统三百余家公营工厂，过去大部均无工会组织，此次经总工会号召许多厂已建立工会。另有七十余厂和总工会取得联系。总工会围绕着生产立功支援战争，还进行了其他各种工作，福利部办了职工合作社供给低廉物品，登记了一千多失业工人，帮助介绍职业，并正筹办工人医院。职工宣传部已建立三个工人俱乐部，现拟即成立工人文艺工作团，加强工人的业余教育。为培养工人干部的工人中学已正式成立，五百人的短期训练班亦于日前开学，女工部则组织了毛泽东青年团。此外还发动了店员联合会，帮助税收调查，动员二百多汽车司机到前方为战争服务。
    【新华社东北十八日电】哈尔滨市市委钟子云最近在干部大会上阐述城市群运方针，他说：三年来，哈市已基本上打垮敌伪政治经济的组织体系，今天哈市的基本任务是“增加生产，繁荣经济”，他号召全体干部动员与组织公私工厂中广大工人，在生产中为国家立功。在私营工厂中则号召工人在劳资两利的原则下发展生产。他指出要以仲裁、调解方式来解决劳资间的各种争执，使劳资双方在两利的原则下团结生产。至于罪大恶极的恶霸分子，可经过人民法庭或公审大会处理，其财产则必须由市府决定处理。他并提出要整顿工人商人组织，纠正若干干部脱离工人，和其他阶层的广大群众的作风，并应提高工人文化、政治、技术水平、业务经验。同时在工人内部加强青年工人与老年工人，普通工人和技术工人间的团结，使他们互相帮助学习，合力生产。各区领导同志要做典型工厂的工作，在工厂和商店中建立正常合理的劳资关系，共同努力发展生产，繁荣经济。
