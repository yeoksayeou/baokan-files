　　Second, Regarding the Issue of Equal Land Distribution

　　Regarding the equal distribution of land, due to the imminence of spring plowing and the early season in the plains, the masses urgently demanded land distribution after the struggle against landlords to avoid delaying production. The original twelve villages (seven administrative villages) in the first phase of mobilization held a joint representative meeting last month, which raised many issues. This meeting incorporated the representatives of the original twelve villages into various support point groups. Before the discussion, the "Land Law Outline" and the "Letter to Farmers" were read, focusing on the principles of equal land distribution. Then, the editorial "Several Issues in Recent Land Distribution" from the January 24th newspaper was read. Afterwards, each group freely debated, raised issues, and resolved them. After two days and two nights of discussion, it was proven that as long as the masses truly grasped the Party's policies, they could resolve the issues well. Finally, the leadership summarized the issues raised and resolved by each group, systematically elevated them, and reported back to everyone.

　　The issues raised and resolved by everyone are as follows:

　　Category 1: Issues Concerning Population Calculation and Others in Land Distribution

　　1. The Issue of Land Distribution for Local Tyrant Landlords and Local Tyrant Rich Peasants: Everyone raised that, according to the "Letter to Farmers," they themselves should not be allocated land and property. However, they also raised whether their family members should be allocated land, and whether they should be allocated a full share or a share of poor land. Finally, everyone agreed that a distinction should still be made between them and their family members. If their family members had not committed crimes or evil deeds, they could be treated as ordinary landlords and rich peasants. As for determining someone as a "local tyrant," it must be discussed and approved by the entire administrative village farmers' congress.

　　As for the land distribution for ordinary landlords and rich peasants, everyone agreed that "rich peasants should be able to produce, and landlords should be able to live."

　　2. The Issue of Land Distribution for Ordinary Landlords and Rich Peasants: The general opinion of the masses was to grant them a small portion of poor land, insufficient to sustain life. They said, "Let those dogs also suffer the hardships of us peasants, and make them dig in the rotten sandy land!" After reading the newspaper editorial, the representatives' thinking was resolved. They said, "That's right! It should be enough for them to eat. Otherwise, they will steal from us, want to eat, and still exploit us." "If they can't survive, like a cornered dog, they will cause unrest in the village, which is still unfavorable to us!"

　　3. Land distribution for soldiers and cadres of landlord and rich peasant origin who sacrificed for the people's cause: Sacrificed individuals should receive a share of land. Everyone said: The feudal exploitation of his family should be separated from his service to the people's cause. Finally, it was decided to allocate land according to the general martyr treatment.

　　4. The Issue of Loafers: Everyone said, "Don't casually label people as loafers! Once labeled, they will lose interest and not be motivated to produce." True loafers must be treated according to the "Letter to Farmers" and not be given land rights. But everyone said: It is necessary to transform them well, organize them into labor, force them to quit opium, and increase their confidence in starting a family and a career, and slowly put them on the right path. Only after they have truly reformed and passed the discussion by the masses can they be given land rights.

　　5. Peasants who were forcibly captured by the Yan bandits during the enemy's invasion last year should be allocated land; those who voluntarily surrendered to the enemy should not be allocated land, but their family members should still be allocated land as ordinary peasants.

　　6. The representatives raised the issue of whether to allocate land to a small number of people in the countryside who hide to avoid military service. Everyone said: This is because they are "not open-minded." They should educate their families well and limit the time to call them back before allocating land. If they fail to return, their share of land should be temporarily kept by the Farmers' Association, and formally allocated after they return to the village. If they have indeed joined the People's Liberation Army or Party, government, or civilian organizations and obtained proof, they should be given land. The representatives also pointed out that some people are hiding from village to village to avoid military service, and this should be rectified in the equal distribution of land, otherwise, it will not only delay production but also reduce the strength of anti-conscription efforts.

　　7. For soldiers of the People's Liberation Army whose families have no relatives, the representatives believed that although they are in the army, they should be allocated a share of land, which should be managed by the Farmers' Association. The annual income, after deducting public grain, should be handed over to them by the Farmers' Association or kept on their behalf, and used as the foundation for starting a family and a career when they are old, disabled, or demobilized. The representatives believed that this would not only enhance their determination to fight for the people more resolutely but also directly consolidate the army.

　　8. When discussing Article 10, Item 5 of the "Land Law Outline" regarding the distribution of land to officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, the representatives proposed: "Lower-ranking soldiers in Yan Xishan's army should be mobilized by their families to write letters calling them back during the equal distribution of land. If they return during the land distribution, they should also be given a share of land." The representatives said, "This is to 'digest' Yan Xishan's army, which is more powerful than fighting him with 100,000 soldiers!"

　　9. During the Japanese occupation, many middle and poor peasants were forced to flee to Datong and Suiyuan due to heavy burdens. Their main people or entire families have fled abroad. Everyone unanimously agreed that this situation should be allocated land to attract them back home to produce and strengthen the liberated area (some have already sent letters requesting to return home).

　　10. Regarding the calculation of population, the issue of how to distribute land to those who have not married wives, unmarried daughters, and unborn children who are pregnant was raised. Everyone agreed: those who have not yet married a wife at the time of land distribution should not be allocated land, unmarried daughters should be allocated land, and unborn children should not be allocated land. In short, calculate according to the actual population at the time of land distribution.

　　11. When discussing the issue of "widows, widowers, orphans, and the lonely," some representatives raised the question of whether an old man or an old woman living alone with several sons who have already separated should be treated as "widows and widowers." Everyone agreed: This situation cannot be called "widows and widowers" and should be allocated land as an ordinary person. There is also a situation of "widows and widowers" who are old and have no biological children, but have "close relatives." Everyone agreed: When distributing land, they should explain to their "close relatives": if they are responsible for supporting the elderly, the elderly will not be allocated land according to "widow and widower" treatment; after the elderly die, the share of land will belong to the supporter. If their "close relatives" are unwilling to take responsibility, the land will be allocated according to widow and widower treatment, and the land will belong to the Farmers' Association after the elderly die.

　　Category 2: Disputes that May Arise in Land Distribution:

　　12. Several situations may cause disputes. Everyone raised the following questions:

　　1. Land purchased by landlords and rich peasants in other villages (such as the landlord of Nanyangdian having three or four qing of land in Dingfengzhuang, and the masses of Nanyangdian demanding distribution, while the masses of Dingfengzhuang have objections).

　　2. Other villages buying land in this village or renting land in this village (such as Shangyangwu buying land in Dongyezhuang, and Dongyezhuang renting land in Xiamodu).

　　3. The main issue is the "outer register land." The so-called "outer register land" is a special situation in Shuidi Village, such as Dongyezhuang buying land in Houshacheng. The land belongs to Dongyezhuang, but still uses the water of Houshacheng. In the old society, all apportionments and grain payments still belonged to Houshacheng, so for Dongyezhuang, this part of the land is called "outer register land" and does not belong to "inner register land" (or called "outer trough land" and "inner trough land").

　　The solutions to the above problems, everyone's opinion is:

　　1. If you buy land in a village far away, the land belongs to the village where it is located (because the two villages are far apart and cannot be surveyed).

　　2. The relationship between "outer register land" in neighboring villages, the principles of solving the dispute are: 1. Villages with more and fertile land should take care of villages with less and barren land; 2. The land belongs to the village closest to it, but villages that are closer, such as those that are convenient for cultivation, can also interplant; 3. The sides of the land belong to the village closest to it (such as if the surrounding area of the land is sealed with stones, the land belongs to Shifeng Village). But the main point is the first one, it must be resolved in the spirit of farmers all over the world are one family, and in the principle of the rich taking care of the poor, the more taking care of the less, and the fertile taking care of the barren.

　　3. If the above possible disputes belong to the same administrative village, they will be resolved by the administrative village committee; if they belong to different administrative villages, a temporary joint representative meeting can be organized by the administrative villages concerned to jointly resolve them, or resolved by the Standing Committee of the District People's Congress.

　　Category 3: The Issue of Drawing and Supplementing Land for Middle Peasants:

　　13. Replenish those whose land is insufficient for the middle peasants. Everyone believes that it is not advisable to draw too much good land from middle peasants with surplus land, otherwise, "they will not stand on the same line with us!" And it should be based on persuasion and willingness, persuading them, "It's better to work harder than to have too many poor people, you have a foundation, work more carefully, the harvest is about the same, and the burden is reduced." Some farmers advocated drawing wheat land from wealthy middle peasants, but everyone disagreed.

　　Category 4: Joint Distribution Issues:

　　14. Must adhere to joint distribution on the basis of administrative villages. Everyone said: "We must handle affairs with the spirit of farmers all over the world are one family, and everyone should take care of the barren and less; representatives take the lead, be selfless, and don't just say that your own village has less land, poor land, and low output."

　　1. Water and dry land are mutually adjusted, but water conservancy remains temporarily untouched, and the principle of "water follows the land" is determined. Note: In Guoxian County, District 1 has the Yangwu River water conservancy, which irrigates a total of eighteen villages. In the old days, disputes over water conservancy often caused deaths. It is said that the Beijing court sent a senior official to mediate and stipulate that stone tablets should be erected in each village, but it was extremely unfair. For example, some villages with less land can use water for two days a month, while some villages with more land can only use water for one day a month. This time, the equal distribution of land made the villages that suffered from water use demand to change this unreasonable situation (some villages have less land and surplus water, and some villages have more land and insufficient water), but due to the urgency of time, the entire water conservancy problem could not be reasonably changed in a hurry, so the method of "water follows the land" was determined. For example, Jiatuo and Shangdalin are one administrative village, Jiatuo has more land and less water, and Shangdalin has less land and more water. The two villages are only three or five li away, and Jiatuo is willing to allocate surplus land, but requires Shangdalin to share water; Shangdalin would rather maintain the original amount of water and not want Jiatuo's land. After discussion, everyone decided that the water will remain temporarily untouched, and the dry and water land in the two villages will be equally distributed. If the farmers of Jiatuo are allocated water land in Shangdalin, the water will follow the land that is allocated.

　　2. Organize administrative village land measurement, evaluation, and distribution committees to jointly and uniformly distribute (most of the water villages are three or five li apart. If the distance is too far, and there is no way to adjust, you can immigrate).

　　Category 5: Land Measurement and Grade Evaluation (Production Evaluation):

　　15. Water land is expensive, "every inch of land is contended for," and land yields vary greatly, ranging from one dou to several dan per mu, so great importance is attached to land measurement and grade evaluation, which is considered to be the key to fair and reasonable land distribution. Now each village has begun to measure the land (some have measured it twice). For example, Danai Fort, measured it three times in a row, first using "bu gong," then using "tian gan" (bamboo pole), and then using ropes. After three comparisons, the exact number was finally determined. Xiamodu used ropes to measure the land, and checked the rope once a day, because the first day was a new rope, and the second day it was two or three inches longer. Hang a red cloth on the rope end as a mark to prevent theft. It is also stipulated that you cannot use the rope to measure your own land to prevent tightening and cheating. In advance, register the acreage of each household, and insert wooden signs on the edge of the land to indicate the numbers for reference.

　　Grade Evaluation: Because the yield of the river land varies greatly, everyone agreed to divide the grades according to the general yield. There are several situations: a few villages such as Yangwu are all water land, and the grades are easy to evaluate; most villages are mixed with dry and water land, and need to be evaluated separately; the land in villages near the slopes is divided into several categories: water, flat, slope, and mountain, and it is more complicated to evaluate the grades. Everyone agreed that plain water land should be allocated according to acreage, but it is difficult due to the large difference in geology, so it is advocated to allocate according to yield, not according to acreage. In order to make the land measurement accurate and not conceal each other, the leadership emphasized re-examination, and instructed the heads of each land measurement team and representatives to be responsible for the measured section of land, stipulating that it should be sealed or fingerprinted to show responsibility, and to investigate responsibility when problems are found during the re-examination.

　　Category 6: Equal Land Distribution Must Become a Mass Movement:

　　16. Everyone discussed and believed that everyone cares about land distribution, and all the masses must be mobilized.

　　1. The representatives go back, first hold a representative meeting, then hold a poor peasant group meeting, and then hold a farmers' congress to mobilize and organize everyone; those who measure the land measure the land, those who evaluate the grades evaluate the grades, and those who count the population count the population; everyone participates, and starts separately; the representatives lead the group leaders, and the group leaders lead the group members, "one level catches up with one level, the more urgent the catch-up!"

　　2. Mainly rely on ideological mobilization to mobilize everyone: Spring plowing is imminent, seize the time to distribute the land, it must be distributed quickly without delaying spring plowing; but also to be divided well, fairly and reasonably. "Land is the lifeblood," "good or bad distribution, ten thousand years of happiness or harm," only when everyone rises to measure the land, evaluate the grades, count the population, and everyone discusses the distribution, can it be measured well, evaluated well, counted well, and finally divided well.

　　3. Stipulate discipline and set good systems. Discipline should be set by everyone and consciously abide by. During the distribution of land, serving everyone is also serving yourself. You must attend meetings, ask for leave if you have something to do, and be serious about various tasks. Those who do not attend meetings and are not responsible should be criticized by everyone.

　　Regarding the issue of discipline, the representatives emphasized it very much this time. They said: "Now a few poor peasants and farm laborers have become grandfathers! As soon as they say they want to hold a meeting, the middle peasants are happy to come, but they don't come. If you criticize them, they say behind their backs: We are poor peasants and farm laborers, see what you can do to me!?" The representatives said: "Discipline was originally for a small number of 'cunning' people, but for poor peasants and farm laborers, we still need more thunder and less rain." The leadership also pointed out that the main thing is to strengthen education and raise awareness.

　　Category 7: Other:

　　17. Some villages excluded canals, mounds, tunnels, etc. when measuring the land. The plain originally had the saying "one mu grows eight fen": it should be unified, seek truth from facts, and measure according to the actual land area.

　　18. The representatives of the urban area raised the question of whether the airport near the urban gate, which had been planted last year, could be divided? Then it pulled to the railway subgrade, railway station base, etc. Everyone finally decided: The above-mentioned airports, railway stations, etc., we will build in the future, and will not be divided at all. The airport can still be adjusted for cultivation, but the land rights belong to the public.

　　19. The rotten sandy wasteland with extremely poor soil quality and extremely low yield in each village is not within the scope of equal land distribution.

　　20. Request the government to issue land certificates. Regarding this issue, when the representatives of the original twelve villages held a representative meeting, they proposed that after the equal distribution of land, the old "red contracts" should be abolished and new land certificates should be issued. But should only the old "red contracts" of landlords and rich peasants be abolished, or should all farmers' contracts be abolished together? It caused controversy. Finally, it was decided to go back and discuss with the masses. After the representatives of Xiamodu returned to the village, they raised it at the farmers' congress, and the middle and poor peasants unanimously advocated abolishing all of them. The reasons are: 1. The old "red contract" is an old stubborn, not our thing. In the old society, our farmers suffered thousands of disasters and difficulties for it and should be overthrown. 2. After the equal distribution of land, the land and the contract are no longer consistent, "it doesn't fit." 3. Even if the land doesn't move, the actual measured acreage will not match the old contract, "it's not accurate." Therefore, everyone agreed: All old "red contracts" should be overthrown, and the government should issue our own new land certificates.

　　21. The representatives pointed out: There are many ancient graves and tombs, some occupying more than ten mu to dozens of mu of land. Everyone agreed: Most of these ancient graves belong to the landlords, and during the equal distribution of land, the graves will be leveled and distributed after discussion by the masses. We propose not to collect public grain in the first year.

　　Third, Rectify the Organization (Transform the Regime), Improve and Consolidate the Organization.

　　The representatives spent one day and one night arguing about organizational issues. Since the mobilization of the masses and the general election of representatives, the old institutions in the countryside have been kicked away by the farmers, and the village regime has actually been replaced by the representative meeting. Some of the old village cadres were removed and investigated, and some were temporarily put aside. All power belongs to the representative meeting. The farmers said, "The administrative village has become an empty power!" The village representatives are busy from dawn to late at night, and various meetings such as representative meetings, poor peasant groups, and farmers' congresses are constantly held. In addition to leading the struggle and distribution, they also need to handle all daily administrative and mass affairs. Since the overthrow of the landlords, the democratic atmosphere among the farmers has been extremely high, but a small deviation has been found: that is, the representatives have to consult the "shopkeeper" (that is, the masses) for everything, and sometimes a farmers' congress is held for a small matter. Although the plains are concentrated, often one administrative village is one village, but it still wastes the energy of the masses. The representatives said, "It's difficult to handle affairs with a blind man!" They requested to rectify the organization and discuss the following issues:

　　1. Improve the division of labor in the representative meeting: Since the struggle, the representative meetings in each village have adopted the "one pot of porridge" method, and everyone discusses and does everything together. The advantage is that everyone takes action and everyone is responsible; the disadvantage is chaos, "the clues are not clear." This time everyone agreed: A representative committee should be formed from the representatives to handle daily affairs. Each village has nine to eleven people, and the titles of chairman and vice-chairman are uniformly changed to chairman and vice-chairman. The representatives said: Chairman Mao leads us farmers as the highest chairman, and we are small chairmen under the leadership of Chairman Mao! The representative committee also serves as the village administrative committee, the name of the village office is uniformly canceled and changed to the village government, and the chairman and vice-chairman of the representative committee also serve as the chairman and vice-chairman of the village government.

　　When discussing the issue of the village chairman, the representatives initially felt that "poor people are in charge," and there were many difficulties: 1. "Tongtian blind stick," can't do things; 2. Afraid of violating policies above, afraid of offending the masses below; 3. The most important thing is that the family is difficult, no firewood and no water (many representatives have been busy for three or four months, and even can't take care of getting firewood). After a long time of arguing, they got through their thoughts and realized that "it's a rare opportunity for us poor people to turn over in a thousand years!" The masses spent so much effort electing us, and we gave up as soon as we got on the battlefield, which is wrong. Finally, they said: "As long as I am not corrupt, not selfish, and serve the masses with a public heart, I am not afraid of violating policies, and I am not afraid of offending people!" They also said: "We blind men manage the world, our eyes are blind but our hearts are not blind! Please invite a secretary, and borrow his two eyes." It can be seen that there are many difficulties in destroying the old institutions and the farmers taking power, but as long as they resolutely support them and raise their ideological awareness, they will strongly overcome all difficulties and rise up to take power themselves. Because this is a problem of peasant democracy, peasants demand democracy, especially the lower-level poor peasants and farm laborers. They can easily understand the importance of their own power in their long and painful experience in the old society. They said: "We made a scene, initially turned over, but now we don't do it, why is that?" Obviously, after the peasants' awareness is raised, they not only demand to obtain economic fruits, but also demand to obtain political fruits.

　　Secondly, regarding the issue of rice subsidies. The old system: each administrative village stipulates that three to five people should be separated from production, and a monthly subsidy of 45 catties of rice. There are three opinions in this discussion: 1. The chairman, vice-chairman, and secretary are separated or semi-separated from production, and receive half of the subsidy. 2. The chairman, secretary, and militia captain receive rice subsidies. 3. Receive the subsidies for three people, and subsidize five or six people according to the specific situation. But in the end it was determined that because the land is currently being equally distributed, the representatives and the masses are participating in the movement together, everyone is working, and there is no need to receive subsidies at present, and it will be studied after the land distribution is completed.

　　2. Further reorganize the team, purify the interior of the poor peasants and farm laborers, establish and consolidate the Farmers' Association, and improve and consolidate all organizations in the equal distribution of land. The poor peasant groups in each village have been established successively before and after the struggle, and have initially formed a backbone force in the countryside. The poor peasants and farm laborers and peasant representatives have been repeatedly reviewed, and it is generally said to be pure. Individual villages are not pure enough (such as the aforementioned Shangshen Village, etc.). Everyone discussed and said: In the equal distribution of land, whoever is good and whoever is bad will be revealed. It is necessary to consolidate and expand the poor peasant group, and unite the middle peasants to improve the Farmers' Association. Some middle-peasant representatives in the village said when discussing the issue of the Farmers' Association: "This is right now, before you were dryly two bones; set up the Farmers' Association, there are bones and flesh." When discussing, the representative of Beijia support point proposed: To establish the Farmers' Association, first make a "hat", that is, first set the participation conditions. After arguing, four conditions were set: 1. Support the poor to turn over, support Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. 2. To distinguish between inside and outside, not to "reflect" outside, not to have two hearts. 3. Loyal and reliable, one heart with us farmers. 4. Work hard, no true loafers. Four disciplines were also set: 1. Work actively; 2. Attend meetings; 3. Do not say bad things to destroy the Farmers' Association; 4. Do not collude with landlords. Establishment method: First discuss in the representative meeting, study the conditions and disciplines, "filter" all the farmers to see who can participate, make a bottom; then hold a poor peasant meeting, and then hold a farmers' congress; explain the reason for establishing the Farmers' Association to everyone, mobilize everyone to register automatically; then the poor peasant group and the congress will review one by one, announce the disciplines and conditions at the same time, see if he can accept it, and then allow him to officially participate.

　　Everyone said: "In the equal distribution of land, whose bones can be seen clearly!" Whoever is fair, whoever is selfish, whoever is active and enthusiastic, and whoever manages themselves will be revealed clearly. Therefore, this is also the key to educating the masses and raising the masses. We should greatly promote the idea of ​​selflessness and that farmers all over the world are one family, and overcome various backward ideas such as selfishness and village centrism that are harmful to the equal distribution of land. At this meeting, the leaders and representatives all emphasized the issue of "public heart." The representatives said: "No matter how well you measure the land and evaluate the grades (appropriate meaning), if you lack a 'public heart,' it's useless!" "Public heart is the first thing!"

　　In the equal distribution of land, we must not only rectify the organization, but also improve the farmers' thinking, so that the equal distribution of land, like the struggle against landlords, becomes a broad mass movement; in every detail of the movement, the working cadres must not only learn from the farmers (they cannot lead the farmers without learning, and they cannot advance the work and successfully complete the distribution task), but also educate the farmers anytime and anywhere to improve the political, ideological, and class awareness of the farmers.

　　Fourth, the Leadership Method and Shortcomings of the Meeting.

　　This meeting more clearly adopted the leadership method of the mass line, and adhered to the leadership policy of "from the masses, to the masses" from beginning to end, that is, learning from the masses while also educating and improving the masses. Therefore, the meeting itself is also a very good study, and it is more realized that only by resolutely believing in the masses, believing in the unlimited creative ability of the masses, and resolutely relying on the masses to rise up to solve their own problems, can there be a true mass line. In summary, the tasks of the working cadres in this meeting are only the following: 1. Faithfully and correctly publicize the Party's policies. 2. Be good at inspiring and guiding the creative wisdom of the masses. 3. Be good at discovering and supporting the correct opinions of the masses. 4. It is also necessary to be good at educating and appropriately struggling with the backward consciousness shown by some people in the masses on certain issues, and to support the correct opinions of the masses in order to unite and improve the masses. 5. Finally, collect the opinions of the masses, improve them after systematic arrangements, and then return to the masses.

　　This meeting was carried out using the above method. Whether it is about correcting wrongly defined components, equally distributing land, improving and consolidating organizations, etc., they are all like this. For example, to study the issue of equal land distribution, the working cadres first correctly explained the three documents, and then argued at the support points. Representatives from each village raised questions, and everyone discussed and resolved them. The meeting was extremely lively and free. Every night, the support point meeting was like a beehive, arguing into a room. After a question was raised, everyone argued until the question was clear. There must be disputes in the middle, such as the issue of "outer register land." There were many disputes, each holding a view, which also led to the issue of joint distribution, involving the issue of water conservancy. When the stalemate could not be resolved, the leadership proposed "Based on the idea that farmers all over the world are one family: Is it the barren taking care of the fertile? Or the fertile taking care of the barren? Is it the villages with more taking care of the villages with less? Or is it the villages with less taking care of the villages with more?" It reminded everyone and solved the problem. Finally, the various issues raised and resolved by each support point were collected and reported to everyone. Everyone said, "Now I understand!"

　　Looking at this meeting now, the main problems are solved in a more detailed and clear way. The shortcomings are that there is too much content, and issues such as public grain work and supporting the front line were also discussed. The farmers cannot remember them. When they left, they all asked to copy a list. They said: "As soon as you mention the beginning, you remember the beginning and the end."

　　The above is the main situation of this meeting. Due to the large county and few cadres (there are only seven people left in District 1 and the urban area), each cadre is responsible for four or five administrative villages, and it is indeed difficult to reflect the specific materials of each village. The level of cadres is low, and the ability to summarize is poor, which is a problem. Is the above approach correct? I hope to give instructions! Best regards!

　　山西崞县是怎样进行土地改革的？（续完）
  　　　　　第二、关于平分土地问题
    关于平分土地，由于春耕在即，平川节令早，故群众于斗地主后，急要求分地，以免误生产。原第一期发动的十二个村（七个行政村）于上月先行召开了一个联合代表会议，问题吵出很多，此次会议，即将原十二村的代表，划编到各支点小组中去。讨论前，先读“土地法大纲”、“告农民书”的平分土地的分配原则部分，后读报纸一月二十四日“关于最近分配土地中的几个问题”的社论，然后各组自由咯吵，提出问题，大家解决，吵了两天两夜，事实证明：只要群众真正掌握了党的政策，自己就能够把问题解决的很好。最后领导上集中了各组所提的及所解决的问题，经过系统提高，向大家作了报告。
    大家所提出及所解决的问题如下：
    第一类、关于土地分配中的计人口及其他等问题。
    一、恶霸地主与恶霸富农的分地问题：大家提出，按“告农民书”规定其本人不能分给土地与财产，但又提出其家属是否应该分地？一般分一份还是分一份赖地？最后大家意见：其本人与其家属还是应该区别。如其家属并未犯罪作恶，可按一般地主富农待遇。至于确定其为“恶霸”，须经全行政村农民大会讨论通过。
    至于一般地主富农的土地分配，大家意见是：要使“富农能生产，地主能生活”。
    二、一般地主富农的分地问题：原群众普遍意见都是恩赐他一小部分赖地，数量也不足维持生活。他们说：“让狗＠的也受受咱农民的苦处，叫他们掏烂沙地去！”读了报纸社论后，给代表们思想上解决了问题。他们说：“对着哩！要够他吃的。不然，他们偷咱们，要的吃，还得剥削咱们。”“他要没法活，狗急跳墙，闹得村子里不安，对咱们还是个不利！”
    三、地主富农出身，为人民事业牺牲的军人与干部，牺牲者应分得一份地。大家说：他对咱人民事业有功，他家庭的封建剥削和他本人给人民办事应该分开。最后决定按一般烈士待遇分地。
    四、二流子问题：大家说：“不要随便给人家戴二流子帽子！一戴上，人家败兴了，闹生产就不起劲。”对真正二流子，一定要照“告农民书”上面说的不给地权。但大家说：一定要好好改造，把他组织到劳动中去，强制他戒大烟，提高他成家立业的信心，慢慢使他走上正路。真正改造以后，再经群众讨论通过，才给地权。
    五、去年阎匪侵袭时，被敌强迫抓走的农民，其本人应给分地；自愿投敌的本人不分，其家属仍按一般农民分地。
    六、代表们提出：农村中有少数人为了逃避兵役，本人躲藏不见，给不给分地问题，大家说：这是因为“脑筋不开”，要好好给他家里教育，限日期把他本人叫回，才给分地。如万一不回，把他应分之一份地，交农会暂为保管，本人回村后，再正式分给；如确已参加解放军或党、政、民机关，取得证明后，即给予分地。代表们并提出：有些人为躲避兵役，从这村躲藏到那村，应在平分土地中加以整顿，否则，既误生产，又减少抗勤力量。
    七、解放军军人，家中已无亲属者，代表们认为：其本人虽在部队，应分得一份地，由农会代为经营管理，每年所得，除应交公粮外，由农会交其本人或代为保管，其本人年老、残废或复员时，可作为成家立业之基础。代表们认为：这样作不仅可以提高其本人更坚决地为人民作战，而且可以直接巩固部队。
    八、讨论“土地法大纲”第十条第五项关于国民党军队官兵分地问题时，代表们提出：“阎顽军队中的下级士兵，在平分土地时应动员他家属写信叫回，如在分地时回来，其本人也给分一份地。”代表们说：“这是为了‘消化’阎锡山军队，比十万兵打他还厉害！”
    九、日寇占领期间，因负担繁重，使不少中贫成份农民被迫逃往大同与绥远等处，其主要人或全家均已逃亡在外，大家一致意见：此种情况，应该分得土地，争取他们回家生产，壮大解放区力量（有的已捎信要求回家）。
    十、计人口中，提到未娶媳妇、未嫁闺女、已怀孕未生的小孩如何分地等问题，大家意见：分地时媳妇尚未娶过者不分，未嫁的闺女应分，未生的小孩也不分。总之，按分地时实有人口计算。
    十一、讨论“鳏、寡、孤、独”问题时，有的代表提出：有的人家，有几个儿子，已分家，留下一个老汉或一个老婆单独生活，是否能按“鳏寡”待遇？大家意见：这样情况，不能称作“鳏寡”，应按普通一口人分地。又有一种“鳏寡”情况，本人年老，并无亲生儿女，但有本家“近门”，大家意见：在分地时，应与其本家“近门”说明：如他负责赡养老人，该老人就不按“鳏寡”待遇分地；老人死后，该一份地即归赡养人所有。如其本家“近门”不愿负责，即按鳏寡待遇分地，老人死后，地归农会。
    第二类、土地分配中可能引起的纠纷：
    十二、有几种情况可能引起纠纷，大家提出了以下的一些问题：
    一、地主富农在其他村买下的土地（如南阳店地主在定风庄置有三四顷土地，南阳店群众要求分配，定风庄群众有意见）。
    二、其他村买下本村的地或租种本村的地（如上阳武买了东野庄的地，东野庄租种了下默都的地）。
    三、主要是“外册地”问题。所谓“外册地”，是水地村的特殊情况，如东野庄买了后沙城的地，地属东野庄，但仍用后沙城的水；在旧社会一切摊派、纳粮仍属后沙城，故对东野庄说：这部分土地称为“外册地”，不属“本册地”（或称“外槽地”、“本槽地”）。
    上述问题的解决办法，大家的意见是：
    一、隔村买地，地在哪村即归哪村（因两村距离远，探不上）。
    二、邻村的“外册地”关系，解决原则有三：１、地多地肥村，照顾地瘦地少村；２、地靠哪村即归哪村，但距离较近的村，如耕种便利时，也可以插花种；３、地的四边靠哪村即归哪村（如该地的四周均为石封地，该地即属石封村）。但主要的是第一点，必须以天下农民一家人的精神，以富照顾穷、多照顾少、肥照顾瘦的原则解决。
    三、上述可能引起的纠纷，如属同一行政村，即由行政村委员会统一解决；如属不同行政村，可由当事行政村组织临时联合代表会共同解决，或经区代会常委会解决。
    第三类、对中农土地的抽补问题：
    十三、中农土地不够者补足。土地长余应抽出一部分的中农，大家认为不能抽好地过多，不然，“人家就不和咱们一条路线上站了！”并且应以说服自愿为主，劝他说：“多贫揽不如多作务，你有底垫，作务更细些，收成差不多，负担也减轻了。”有的农民主张抽富裕中农的麦子地，大家不同意。
    第四类、联合分配问题：
    十四、一定坚持以行政村为单位联合分配。大家说：“要拿起天下农民一家人的精神办事，瘦肥多少大家照顾；代表带头，大公无私，不要尽说自己本村地少、地赖、产量低”。
    一、水旱地互相调剂，但水利暂不动，决定“水跟地走”的原则。按：崞县一区有阳武河水利，共灌溉十八村，旧日因争夺水利常肇人命。相传曾由北京朝廷派大员调处规定，各村立有石碑，但极不公。如有些村地少，每月能使水两日，有些地多村反只每月使水一日。此次平分土地，使水吃亏的村庄要求改变这种不合理情况（有的村地少水有余，有的村地多水不足），但因时间紧迫，整个水利问题，一时无法仓卒合理变动，故确定“水跟地走”的办法，如贾陀与上大林为一个行政村，贾陀地多水少，上大林地少水多，两村距离仅三五里，贾陀愿意拨出多余土地，但要求上大林分水；上大林宁愿保持原有水量，不要贾陀的地。大家讨论结果，决定水暂不动，两村水旱地平均分配。如贾陀农民分到上大林水地，水即跟被分的地走。
    二、组织行政村丈地、评议、分配委员会，联合统一分配（水地村大多距离三五里相挨。如距离过远，没法调剂时，可移民）。
    第五类、丈地与评等级（评产量）：
    十五、水地土贵，“寸土必争”，土地产量又悬殊极大，每亩有从一斗至石数之差，故对丈地与评等极为重视，认为是平分土地能否公平合理的关键。现各村已开始丈地（有的已丈二遍）。如大牛堡，连续丈了三次，先用“步弓”，后用“天竿”（竹竿），再用绳索，三次对比，最后确定准数。下默都用绳索丈地，每天检查绳子一次，因第一天是新绳，第二天即长二三寸。绳头挂红布作记号，防止偷换。并规定本人不能用绳子丈自己地，防止紧松作弊。事先并各户登记地亩，在地边插木牌标明数字，以便参考。
    评等级：因川地产量悬殊，大家意见按通产分等。有几种情况：少数村庄如阳武等，全为水地，等级易评；大部分村庄水旱夹杂，需分别评等；靠边坡村庄地分几类：水、平、坡、山，评等级时更为复杂。大家意见：平川水地按地亩分配，因地质悬殊感到困难，故主张按产量分配，不按地亩分配。领导上为使丈地确实，互不隐瞒，强调提出复查，责成各丈地小组长及代表对所丈量之一段地负责，规定盖章或按手印，以示负责，并以便复查时发现问题追究责任。
    第六类、平分土地必须成为群众运动：
    十六、大家讨论认为分地人人关心，要把所有群众发动起来。
    一、代表回去，先开代表会，再开贫农团会，再开农民大会，把所有的人都动员起来，组织起来；丈地的丈地，评等的评等，计口的计口；人人参加，分头下手；代表领导组长，组长领导组员，“一级赶一级，越赶越紧！”
    二、主要靠思想动员，把大家发动起来：春耕在即，抓紧分配土地，既要分得快，不误春耕；又要分得好，公平合理。“地是命根子”，“分得好坏，万年福害”，只有大家起来丈地、评等、计口，大家讨论分配，才能丈好、评好、计好、最后分好。
    三、规定纪律，定好制度。纪律要大家自己定自觉遵守。分配土地期间，为大家服务也即为自己服务。开会要到，有事要请假，各种工作要认真。开会不到、不负责任的人，要受到大家批评。
    关于纪律问题，这次代表们极强调，他们说：“现在有少数贫雇农成了爷爷啦！一说开会，中农们倒欢欢来了，他们就不来。批评他，就在背后说：咱是贫雇农，看能把我怎！？”代表们说：“纪律原是为少数‘奸顽’人，但对贫雇农还是要多响雷少下雨。”领导上也指出应主要的加强教育，提高觉悟。
    第七类、其它：
    十七、已有村庄丈地时将渠、圪瘩、地道等除外，平川原有“一亩种八分”之说：应该统一，实事求事，按实际土地面积丈量。
    十八、城区代表提出：城关附近之飞机场，去年已经种上，是否可分？后又扯到铁路路基，火车站站基等。大家最后决定：上述飞机场、铁路火车站等，将来我们还要建设，一律不分。飞机场仍可调剂耕种，但地权归公。
    十九、各村土质极劣、产量极低之烂沙荒地，不在平分土地之内。
    二十、要求政府制发土地证。此问题，原十二村开代表会时，代表们提出：在平分土地后，应该废除旧“红契”，发给新土地证。但单是废除地富的旧“红契”、抑或连同全体农民的一齐废除？引起争论，最后决定，回去与群众商量，下默都代表回村后，在农民大会上提出，中贫农一致主张全部废除。理由是：一、旧“红契”是老顽固，不是咱们的东西，在旧社会咱农民为它受过千灾万难，应打倒。二、平分土地后，地与契已不相符合，“不投了”。三、即使地不动，实丈的地数与旧契也将不符，“不准了”。因此大家同意：旧“红契”一律打倒，由政府制发咱们自己的新土地证。
    二十一、代表提出：有不少古坟古墓，有占土地十几亩到几十亩的。大家意见：这些古坟，大多属于地主的，在平分土地时，经群众讨论平坟分配。我们提出头年不征公粮。
    　　　　第三、整顿组织（改造政权）健全与巩固组织问题。
    代表们用了一天一黑夜时间咯吵了组织问题。从发动群众、普遍选举代表以后，农村中旧的机构已为农民一脚踢开，村政权实际上已为代表会所代替，旧村干部，有的被撤职审查，有的被暂搁一边。一切权力归到了代表会。农民们说：“行政村成了空权关哪！”村代表从天亮忙到深夜，代表会、贫农团、农民大会等各种会议不断进行。除领导斗争与分配外，还需处理行政与群众的一切日常事务。自从打倒地主以来，农民中民主空气极高，但却发现一种小偏向：即代表们凡百事都要请示“掌柜”（即群众），有时为一小事开了一个农民大会。虽因平川集中，往往一个行政村即一村，但终究浪费群众精力。代表们说：“瞎汉办事可难哩！”要求整顿组织，讨论以下几个问题：
    一、健全代表会进行分工：自斗争以来，各村代表会均采“一锅粥”办法，遇事大家商量大家作。好处是大家动手，大家负责；坏处是乱，“头绪不清”。这次大家意见是：由代表中产生代表委员会，处理日常事务。每村九人至十一人，正副主任一律改为正副主席。代表们说：毛主席领导咱农民是最高主席，咱们是在毛主席领导下的小主席！代表委员会兼村行政委员会，村公所名称一律取消，改为村政府，代表委员会正副主席兼村政府正副主席。
    讨论到村主席问题，开始代表们感到“穷人当家”，困难很多：一、“通天瞎棒”，办不了事；二、上怕犯了政策，下怕得罪群众；三、最主要的是家里困难，没柴没水（不少代表一直忙了三四个月，连柴也顾不上打）。经过长时咯吵，搞通了思想，觉悟到“咱穷人翻身，千年难遇！”群众费了多少心事选举了咱，刚上了阵，就泄了气，这是不对的。最后说：“只要我一不贪污，二不自私，公心为群众服务，也不怕犯政策，也不怕得罪人！”又说：“咱瞎汉管天下，眼瞎心不瞎！请上个书记，借用他两只眼。”可见摧毁旧机构，农民当权，有不少困难，但只要坚决撑腰，提高了思想觉悟后，他们会坚强地排除万难自己起来当权的。因为这是农民民主问题，农民要求民主，特别是低层贫雇农，他们在旧社会长期痛苦的经历中，很容易体会到自己当权的重要。他们说：“咱们闹了一场，初翻了身，现在不干了，这是为甚呢？”显然，农民觉悟以后，不仅要求获得经济果实，而且要求获得政治果实。
    其次，关于米津贴问题。旧制：每行政村规定三人至五人脱离生产，每月津贴米四十五斤。这次讨论有三种意见：一，正副主席、书记三人脱离、或半脱离生产，领半津贴。二，正主席、书记、民兵队长三人领米津贴。三，领三个人的津贴，根据具体情况补助五、六个人。但最后确定：因现正平分土地，代表与群众一样都参加运动，人人工作，目前不需领津贴，待土地分配完毕后再研究。
    二、更进一步整编队伍，纯洁贫雇农内部，建立及巩固农会，在平分土地中健全与巩固一切组织。各村贫农团已于斗争前后先后建立，并初步在农村中形成骨干力量。贫雇农与农民代表均经一再审查，一般说是纯洁的。个别村子尚不够纯洁（如前述上申村等村）。大家讨论说：在平分土地中，谁好谁赖都要露出来。要巩固扩大贫农团，并且要团结中农把农会搞好。有些村中农成份代表，在讨论到农会问题时说：“这下就对了，以前你们干巴巴就两圪瘩骨头；把农会成立起，有骨头也有肉了。”讨论时，北贾支点代表提出：要成立农会，先要作个“帽子”，即先要定出参加条件。咯吵结果，定出四条：一、拥护穷人翻身，拥护毛主席、共产党。二、要分出里外，不在外面乱“反映”，不能两瓣心。三、忠实可靠，和咱农民一条心。四、要好好劳动，真正二流子不要。又定出纪律四条：一、积极工作；二、开会到会；三、不能说坏话破坏农会；四、不准和地主勾搭。成立办法：先在代表会讨论，把条件、纪律研究后，将全体农民“滤一滤”，看谁能参加，打个底底；然后开贫农会，再开农民大会；把成立农会的道理向大家说“机明”，发动大家自动报名；再经贫农团与大会一个个审查，把纪律与条件同时宣布，看他能不能接受，然后才允许正式参加。
    大家说：“平分土地中，谁的骨头都能看清！”谁公正、谁自私、谁积极热心、谁各管自己，都会显露明白。因此，这又是教育群众、提高群众的关键。应该大大发扬大公无私、天下农民一家人的思想，克服自私、村本位等各种有害于平分土地的落后思想。这次会议，领导与代表均强调“公心”问题。代表们说：“不管你丈地评等闹得怎嵌（合适的意思），短个‘公心’提甚球也不顶！”“甚不甚公心为第一！”
    在平分土地中，不仅要整顿组织，而且要提高农民思想，要使平分土地与斗地主一样，成为广大群众性的运动；在运动的每一个细节中，工作干部不仅要向农民学习（不学习无法领导农民，并无法使工作前进及胜利完成平分任务），而且要随时随地教育农民，提高农民的政治、思想、阶级觉悟。
    　　　　第四、会议的领导方法与缺点。
    这次会议，更明确地采取了群众路线的领导方法，自始至终坚持了“从群众中来到群众中去”的领导方针，即向群众学习同时又教育提高群众。因而，会议本身也是一种很好的学习，更体会到只有坚决相信群众，相信群众的无限创造能力；坚决依靠群众自己起来解决自己问题，才有真正的群众路线。总括的看，这次会议，工作干部的任务只有下列几个：一、忠实正确宣传党的政策。二、善于启发诱导发挥群众创造智慧。三、善于发现及支持群众的正确意见。四、也须善于与群众中部分人某些问题上所表现的落后意识作教育和作适当的斗争，为群众的正确意见撑腰，才能团结与提高群众。五、最后集中群众意见，经系统条理予以提高后，再回到群众中去。
    这次会议，便是采用上述方法进行的。无论关于改正错订成份、平分土地、健全与巩固组织等均如此。比如研究平分土地问题，先由工作干部正确讲解了三个文件，然后分支点咯吵。由各村代表提出问题，大家讨论解决。会议极为活泼自由，每夜支点会议就象一窝蜂房，吵成一屋。一个问题提出后，大家咯吵，直到问题明确。中间定有争论，如“外册地”问题，争论很多，各持一见，其中并引起联合分配问题，牵涉到水利问题，相持不下时，领导上提出“根据天下农民一家人的思想：是地瘦的照顾地肥的呢？还是地肥的照顾地瘦的呢？地多村照顾地少村呢？还是地少村照顾地多村？”提醒了大家，把问题解决了。最后便将各支点所提出与解决的各种问题集中，向大家作了报告，大家说：“这下才闹机明了！”
    这次会议，现在看起来，主要问题解决较细致明确，缺点是内容过多，又讨论了公粮工作与支援前线等问题，农民记不住，临走时，都要求抄个单单。他们说：“一提头，就记起头尾来了。”
    以上是此次会议的主要情况。每个村的具体材料，因县大，干部少（现一区与城区只留七人），每个干部负责四、五个行政村，在反映材料上确有困难。干部水准低，总结能力又差，这是个问题。以上作法是否对？希望给以指示！此致布礼！
