Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th. The Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and the Northeast Administrative Committee issued instructions on the spring plowing movement on the 25th of last month, pointing out that this year's spring plowing movement in the Northeast Liberated Areas is related to the liberation of the entire Northeast and the support of the national war. For the vast number of peasants who have been emancipated, it is related to building a home and developing production in the future, as well as consolidating the victory of land reform. Therefore, all other affairs must be subordinate to and cooperate with the completion of the spring plowing movement. This year's spring plowing must be a large-scale production movement with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, resolutely uniting middle peasants and organizing all levels of people, both men and women, old and young, in the rural areas. In addition to distributing and leaving the land that landlords and rich peasants should receive, they should also be organized to produce and helped to solve their production difficulties. Rear organs and troops must engage in agricultural production and can independently or jointly organize large-scale state-owned farms to lay the foundation for the future development of state-owned farms. This year, rear organs and troops in all provinces and counties must go all out to establish an agricultural production base, and be responsible for self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat throughout the year starting from July of this year, and at least two months of grain self-sufficiency next year. The war zone should strive to plant after the war. Without hindering the operation, the troops should help the masses to produce as much as possible. The instructions specifically pointed out that urban industrialists, businessmen, and people with surplus floating capital can invest in rural areas to develop agriculture. Apply to the provincial government for land, and the government should encourage and help solve difficulties. If the land received belongs to the state, the government will exempt other taxes except for agricultural tax (ie, public grain). If the land received is wasteland, agricultural tax will be exempted in the first year, 10% will be levied in the second year, and then levied according to the proportion of public grain. As for the newly recovered areas in South Manchuria and on both sides of the railway, due to Chiang Kai-shek's exorbitant taxes and levies, there is an unusual shortage of grain. Emphasis should be placed on production, saving, and preparing for famine. Grain should be adjusted on a provincial basis. If the province is unable to adjust and solve the problem, the Northeast Liberated Area will carry out the adjustment. The instructions also stated that the success or failure of spring plowing depends on leadership. Every party member and government worker, every rural work, should actively participate in this great movement. Oppose bureaucracy and subjectivism, go deep into the countryside, conduct solid inspections, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and exchange experiences in a timely manner.

　　东北局发布春耕指示
  　开展大生产运动
    【新华社东北十五日电】中共东北中央局暨东北行政委员会于上月二十五日发出关于春耕运动的指示，指出：今年东北解放区的春耕运动，关系全东北的解放和支援全国战争，对广大翻身农民来说，则关系今后兴家立业，发展生产与巩固土地改革的胜利，因此一切其他事务，均必须服从和配合完成春耕运动。今年的春耕必须是以贫雇农为骨干，坚决团结中农组织农村各阶层人民全体男女老幼的大生产运动，对地主富农除分给及留与应得的土地外，也要组织他们生产，帮助解决其生产的困难。后方机关部队必须从事农业生产，并可单独或合力组织规模较大的公营农场，奠定将来公营农场的发展基础。今年各省县后方机关部队必须以全力建立农业生产基础，担负从本年七月起全年菜蔬肉类自给，及明年至少两个月的粮食自给。作战区要力争战后抢种，在不妨碍作战下，部队要多帮助群众生产。指示特别指出城市工商业家及有剩余游资的人们可以投资乡村发展农业。向各省政府领取土地，政府应鼓励与帮助解决困难，所领取之土地属于国有者，政府除征收农业税（即公粮）外，免除其他税收，如所领取之土地系荒地，第一年免征农业税，第二年征百分之十，以后按公粮比例征收。至于南满与铁道两侧新收复区，由于蒋匪横征暴敛，粮食异常缺乏，应重视生产节约备荒，以省为单位进行调剂粮食，本省无力调剂解决者，由东北解放区进行调剂。指示并称：春耕的成败决定于领导，每一个党员与政府工作人员者，每一农村工作，都应积极参加这一伟大运动。反对官僚主义，主观主义，深入农村，札札实实检查，及时发现问题，解决问题，并及时交流经验。
