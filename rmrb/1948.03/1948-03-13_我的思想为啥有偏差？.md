Column: Working Communications

We welcome comrades from all parts of the border region who are participating in land reform work to exchange work experiences, exchange work opinions, study work problems, and gather opinions from various aspects and then solve them together. Whether it is systematic or fragmentary, material or心得 [xīndé - insights gained from experience], whether in the form of writing articles, writing letters, or writing newsletters and diaries, any form is fine, just write down what you want to say; don't be like the Party's eight-legged essay [bāgǔ wén - a rigid and formal style of essay writing formerly required in the imperial examinations] or be empty and hollow. Other comrades can also write letters to discuss if they have different opinions. Each place has its specific circumstances, and the communications published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for everyone's reference.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
  　Why are my thoughts biased?
    Jian Hong
    After land reform studies, I went to work in the village with enthusiasm and a mind full of "poor and hired peasants." In the past, I had done some mass work, but my class stand was ambiguous and my work style was mechanically simple. These problems had been reviewed in the land reform studies, but because I did not grasp the spirit of the land conference sufficiently and my understanding of the poor and hired peasants was still very abstract, the old thinking and work style reappeared as soon as I got into the actual work.
    When I started working in the village, I had some antipathy towards all the village cadres. In the initial rectification of the Party, the village head and several other Party cadres performed well, but I thought the village head's self-criticism was slippery. Because I had a preconceived subjective feeling that the main cadres must be the worst, the masses must be most afraid, their resistance must be the greatest, and their reflection must be a deliberate attempt to curry favor with the working comrades. Zhang Shu spoke some truth during the Party rectification and expressed his support for the Land Law. Because he was a middle peasant, I felt that he might not be sincere, and I thought that what the two cadres with poor peasant backgrounds said was truly good. It turned out from the Party rectification and the movement that the village head was not as bad as I thought. He did not embezzle, the fruits he obtained were the same as the masses, and the masses' reaction to him was not too bad. Some peasants were even willing to elect him as a candidate for the village political committee. He has been working as a branch secretary under the leadership of the Party for several years, and he has some understanding of the Party, so it was easier for him to accept the Land Law this time, and his self-criticism was more sincere and serious. Secondly, regarding the view of the poor and hired peasant backbone, because I had the preconceived notion in my mind that everything about the poor and hired peasants was correct, I only looked for their advantages and did not dare to face up to the shortcomings of the poor and hired peasants, fearing that I would misunderstand them. Therefore, at the beginning, I did not dare to clearly affirm the shortcomings of the hired peasant Zhang Beifang, such as his impulsiveness, simplicity, and lack of ideas. After further investigation, the reason for making such a bias was still starting from personal fear of making mistakes, not truly starting from the interests of the poor and hired peasants.
    Because the investigation and research work was not done enough, the in-depth and development of the work was limited to a certain extent. After participating in the work in the village for more than 20 days, I only understood some fragmented materials about the overall situation of the village, and could not grasp the characteristics and overall situation of the village, which put myself in a passive state, unable to see the problems, and the work could not be in-depth and meticulous. The way to mobilize the poor and hired peasants and the initial effort to find the poor and hired peasants was still not small, but the purpose was not clear. When the poor and hired peasants were almost discovered, I didn't know what to do. I only kept circling around giving opinions to the cadres and breaking through the idea of "not daring to do it," treating them as objects for finding materials. Besides that, I didn't know what else to talk about. In fact, there are many issues that need to be understood about the poor and hired peasants, such as what sufferings they have suffered in the past, what their ideological situation is, and how big their current holes are, etc. But I understood a general idea and did not go further to understand and study. In short, this is because I still lack true love for the poor and hired peasants. The so-called mind full of "poor and hired peasants" does not start from the poor and hired peasants, but from the work task. This is a good test for me. If I really care about the poor and hired peasants, I would never feel that there is nothing to say and nothing to do.
    In the work, I seemed to trust the poor and hired peasants very much on the surface, but in reality, I still looked down on the honest poor and hired peasants. For example, Jia Zhengfang, a bloodline poor peasant who had been a farmhand all his life, only bought two mu and four fen [a Chinese unit of area] of land in the rent reduction and interest reduction movement in 1944. After he got married last winter, his wife brought more than three mu of land, but he did not benefit. When visiting the poor and hired peasants, I simply and one-sidedly recognized him as a middle peasant, only seeing that he currently had more than six mu of land. In fact, he had not turned over well several times, and only got one mu of land last year. The floating wealth was divided very little, and it was all unusable things. Although he now has more than six mu of land, the foundation is very empty, and he has been employed by an oil mill last year. After the masses elected him as the chairman of the poor peasant association, he did not show any arrogance at all, and he was very modest in his work, always discussing with everyone. The masses have been satisfied with this democratic work style, proving that my view of him is completely wrong. The view of the hired peasant Zhang Laishan is also the same. I felt that he was an honest peasant, only knew how to laugh foolishly, spoke very little, and could not see any ability or advantages, and I was skeptical that he would be able to be a backbone of the poor peasant association. But he performed very well in the actual movement. He was enthusiastic and serious about the establishment of the poor peasant association. At the first review meeting of the poor peasant association, he pointed out the problem that Zhang Fu was unwilling to reflect on himself and asked him to review. After the new members were elected, some people shirked responsibility. He criticized and encouraged them, saying: If you don't work for the poor, who else do you want to work for? As long as the masses believe in us, what are we afraid of?
    At the beginning, I still trusted some people who were eloquent, because what they said catered to my heart, what they said was exactly what I wanted to know, they could provide me with materials, and I felt that these people were capable. According to my idea, I would definitely "promote" these people to be the backbone. At that time, several poor and hired peasants said: If these people become cadres, they will still bully the masses. Some comrades in the work team also said that these people have problems and cannot let them take power. I was uncomfortable for a long time, feeling that their exclusion of these capable people was not correct, thinking that although they had been cadres and made mistakes, they were still poor peasants. I did not have enough understanding of their retaliatory destructiveness and undemocratic work style. This period of working in the village made me deeply understand the correctness of the masses, and it was a good education for me to distrust the honest poor and hired peasants.

  　我的思想为啥有偏差？
    健虹
    土改学习后，我带着满腔热情与满脑子“贫雇”参加村里工作。过去我曾做过些群众工作，工作中阶级立场模糊，作风机械简单。这些毛病在土改学习中已做过检讨，但因对土地会议的精神掌握不够，对贫雇了解还很抽象，故一到实际工作中，旧的思想作风又出现了。
    到村开始工作，我对所有村干部都有些恶感，在初步整党中，村长和其他几个党员干部表现较好，但我对村长的自我批评认为是滑头。因预先主观上即觉得几个主要干部一定最坏，群众一定最怕，他们的反抗也一定是最大，对他的反省也认为是故意耍滑头逢迎工作同志的。张树的在整党时说了些老实话，表示拥护土地法，因他是中农，我就觉得他不一定是真心话，对两个贫农成份的干部说的话，便认为是真正的好。从整党与运动过程中证明，村长并不是我所想的那样糟，他没有贪污，果实得的和群众一样，群众对他的反映并不太坏，有些农民还愿选他当干部，现在已被选为村政委员会候补委员。他担任支书在党的领导下工作好几年，对党是有些认识的，故他这次接受土地法较容易，检讨也较诚恳认真。其次是对贫雇骨干的看法，因自己脑子里预先就有贫雇一切都是正确的思想，所以专找他们的优点，不敢去正视贫雇的缺点，恐怕看错了，故对雇农张北方的急性、简单、没主张的缺点，一开始看到不敢明确肯定。深追一下犯这样偏向的原因，还是从个人怕错出发，并不是真正从贫雇利益出发。
    因为调查研究工作做的不够，使工作的深入和开展受到了一定的限制，参加村里工作二十多天，对全村的面貌也只了解了一些零碎的材料，掌握不住村里的特点和全面情况，使自己处于被动状态，看不出问题来，工作就不能深入细致。对发动贫雇的方式和开始找贫雇时劲儿还不小，但目的性不明确，等到贫雇发现差不多了，就不知该干啥了，只扭住给干部提意见与打通“不敢干”的思想上打圈子，把他们当作找材料的对象，除此外，再不知谈什么了。实际上对贫雇需要了解的问题是很多的，如贫雇过去受过些什么苦，他们的思想状况如何，他们现在的窟窿有多大等等。但我了解一个大概，便没去进一步了解研究。总之，这是我对贫雇还缺乏真正的热爱，所谓满脑子“贫雇”，并不是从贫雇出发，还是从工作任务出发的，这对我是一个很好考验。若对贫雇是真正关心的话，决不会感到无话可说无事可干的。
    在工作中表现上好象很相信贫雇，实际思想还是看不起老实贫雇。如对住了一辈子长工的血统贫雇贾正方，四四年减租减息运动中才买了二亩四分地，去冬结婚后，他老婆带来三亩多地，并未得利，访贫雇时，我简单片面地就把他认成中农，只看到他目前有六亩多地，其实他几次翻身都没翻好，去年只得了一亩地，浮财分得很少，且都是不能用的东西。现在虽已有六亩多地，底子很空，去年还一直给油坊受。群众选他当贫农团主席后，他丝毫没有一点自高自大的表现，办事非常虚心，总要和大家商量，群众对这种民主作风已感到满意，证明我对他的看法是完全错误的。对雇农张来山的看法也是一样，觉得他是老实农民，只会傻笑，说话很少，看不出一点能力与优点，心里怀疑他当贫农团骨干不行。但他在实际运动中一切表现都很好，他对贫农团的成立是热心认真的，在贫农团第一次检讨会上，他指出张富不愿反省的问题要他检讨。选出新委员后，有个别推诿的人，他一面批评一面鼓励地说：不给穷人干还想给谁干呢？只要群众信仰，咱还怕什么呢？
    一开始我还是信任能说会道的一些人，因他们说的话迎合我的心，他们说的正是自己所想知道的，能供给自己材料，又觉得这些人能干，照我的想法，定要“提拔”这些人当骨干的。当时有几个贫雇说：这些人当干部照样还会欺侮群众的，工作组有的同志也说这些人有毛病，不能让他们掌权，我思想上很长时间不痛快，觉得他们对这些能干人排挤是不正确的，认为他们虽当过干部犯过错，但还是个贫农呀，而对他们的报复性破坏性及不民主的作风是认识不够的。在村里工作这个时期，使我深刻的了解了群众的正确，对我不信任老实贫雇是个很好的教育。
