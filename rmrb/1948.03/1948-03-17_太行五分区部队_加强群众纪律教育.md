Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district Troops
  Strengthen Mass Discipline Education
[This newspaper Taihang news] During the old Lunar New Year, the Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district troops carried out discipline education and mass discipline inspection. All units reviewed and reflected on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. They also organized discipline inspection teams to conduct a general inspection. All land or public land that had been planted by the masses in the past were returned to the masses, and all items damaged were compensated for, and apologies were made to the masses. The Fifth Regiment Committee of the sub-district also conducted education and inspection on mass discipline, combat discipline, and the policy towards prisoners of war. In terms of leadership inspection organization, the company was taken as the unit, and democratic elections were adopted to establish a soldiers' discipline inspection committee to lead the inspection. Soldiers and cadres criticized each other and conducted self-criticism. In terms of ideological guidance, the proletariat's stand and the principle of building the people's army were used to analyze and understand their own acts and thoughts of violating discipline, so as to improve class consciousness and disciplinary consciousness. For example, for comrades who have violated mass discipline, they were first asked whether they were seeking the interests of the masses or harming the interests of the masses. This enlightened their class consciousness and helped them understand the essence of the people's army. For example, Xu Dashun, a soldier of the artillery company, violated discipline. When he was in Changyuan, he used the doors of the common people to make a fire, feigned illness during battles, deliberately lagged behind during marches, deliberately drank cold water, and sat on a stretcher due to stomach pain. Everyone criticized him for making the masses freeze in order to keep warm. Wang Fenghua, who was from a poor peasant family, borrowed an axe from the common people and did not return it. Everyone said that he was a poor person who forgot his roots after putting on a military uniform. After the study, each company organized mass work teams to investigate the lives and difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in the stationed villages, carrying water and manure for the masses, unlike in the past, where they only had the concept of landlords and no concept of the masses.

　　太行五分区部队
  　加强群众纪律教育
    【本报太行消息】太行五分区部队在旧历年关时，进行了纪律教育与群众纪律检查，各部根据三大纪律、八项注意作了检讨、反省，并组织纪律检查组，普遍进行检查，对过去种群众的地或公地，都一律退还群众，损坏群众的东西都一一赔偿，并向群众道歉。分区五十二团团委会亦以群众纪律、战斗纪律、俘虏政策进行教育和检查。在领导检查组织方式上，以连为单位，采取民主选举，成立士兵查纪委员会领导检查，战士干部互相批评及自我批评。在思想指导上，是以无产阶级立场、人民军队的建军原则，通过自己破坏纪律的行为和思想，加以分析和认识，提高阶级自觉和纪律自觉。如对破坏了群众纪律的同志，首先问他是为群众谋利益呢？还是损害了群众的利益呢？这样启发其阶级觉悟，认识人民军队的本质。如炮兵连战士许达顺破坏纪律，在长垣时用老百姓门板烤火，打仗时装病，行军时故意掉队，故意喝冷水，肚痛坐担架，大家批评他为了取暖叫群众受冻。贫农出身的王风花，借老百姓斧子不还，大家说他自己是穷人穿上军装忘了本。学习后，各连都组织了群众工作小组，在驻村调查贫雇的生活和困难，给群众担水挑粪，不象过去那样，只有房东观念，没有群众观念。
