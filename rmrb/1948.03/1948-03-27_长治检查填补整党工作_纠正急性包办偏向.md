(News from this newspaper) The Changzhi County Party Committee has conducted an inspection of the filling and rectification work over the past half-month (March 1st to 15th), and found that the main problem in the work is impatience, which has led the work astray. The inspection situation is published below for reference by various places.

Changzhi County has a total of sixteen key villages for filling and rectification work, with eight second-class villages, seven near first-class villages, and one third-class village. Currently, eight villages are undergoing party rectification, and the rest are reorganizing the masses' ranks. The steps and methods adopted are basically as follows, except in a few villages: first, publicizing the Outline Land Law. Regarding the policies for all classes, the focus is on publicizing that it is not about disrupting and equally distributing land, but only adjusting land based on the past land reform, and carrying out democratic movements, emphasizing class, and stabilizing people's hearts. Then, in-depth individual visits to poor peasants and hired laborers are conducted, and the type of village is determined based on the investigation to decide on the approach. After clarifying the situation, the next step is to organize and reorganize the masses' ranks, organize poor peasant leagues, or establish and rectify farmers' associations. Once this is preliminarily completed, the party will be made public and party members will be examined.

The reorganization of the masses' ranks is carried out through ideological mobilization, on the basis of mass awareness, to organize the masses. In some places, poor peasant leagues are established immediately.

From this stage of work, the most common and numerous problems raised by the masses are the unfair distribution of fruits of labor, lack of democracy, poor work style of cadres, and protection of landlords. Among them, the unfair distribution of fruits of labor and the lack of autonomy in the work style of cadres are the most prominent. The second most prominent issues are variable labor accounts, incorrect class determination, and unfair grain production. In general, the masses oppose the powerful cadres in the villages. Generally speaking, the composition of the party branches is relatively pure, with the vast majority being poor peasants and hired laborers. No landlord or rich peasant party members have been found in any of the key villages. However, party members lack education, most do not play a role, and some branches are merely a formality. In reality, the power holders are bad cadres outside the party and individual bad party members, who jointly form the ruling group in the village. Some are manipulated by landlords and rich peasants outside the party, and some are opportunists in charge. The villages have more opinions about non-party cadres than about party cadres. They are mostly cadres from the anti-traitor and liquidation movement. Some have been replaced, while others are still in power.

The main problem in the work is impatience. However, some places, fearing to make mistakes, want to have a truly complete understanding of the whole village situation before taking action, carrying out isolated investigations and delaying time, committing a chronic illness. But this is not the main thing, the main thing is impatience. Impatience is manifested in arriving in the village without understanding the situation, only looking for a few poor peasants and hired laborers to take action. Some main responsible comrades in the district even said, why bother understanding the situation, "we will understand when the masses rise up," taking an adventurous approach. In ＠埚 village in the first district, a poor peasant group was organized in three days, a poor peasant league was established in four days, party rectification was carried out in five days, and in six days it fell into sectarian strife between streets. Some make crude judgments about the situation, not knowing how many poor peasants and hired laborers there are, and how many have not been emancipated, and blindly decide on the type of village, organize poor peasant leagues, and determine the leading role of the poor peasant league based on whether the branch is pure or impure; others determine it based on the number of opinions about cadres, blindly organizing the masses to oppose the old foundation cadres branch; still others determine the establishment of the poor peasant league based on the quality of the branch, and judge the quality of the entire branch based on the quality of a few branch committee members. Party rectification work does not involve ideological preparation in the masses and within the party, does not educate or inspire their class consciousness, simply gives the branch a set of rules, and does not distinguish between good and bad party members. Party rectification is carried out without ideological preparation and education among the masses, resulting in party members not understanding the ideology and resisting, the masses becoming angered, the leadership becoming passive, and the problem not being resolved, forming a stalemate.

		Work Does Not Start From Reality, Subjectively Creating a Boisterous Scene

The reason is mainly that cadres are influenced by the bad work style of the past, they are unwilling to be meticulous and find it troublesome, and they are infatuated with the boisterous scenes of the past. Secondly, this year's spring is shallow, the masses are afraid of delaying planting, and they also demand speed, and the leaders also want to determine land rights before spring plowing to facilitate production; but they do not start from the actual situation of the work, and blindly follow the masses. Thirdly, at the Lujiazhuang meeting, the county party committee decided to break through the key points in 20 days, and generally end the party rectification and expand outward. Although the county party committee changed its mind after the meeting, emphasizing that it was not limited by 20 days, individual districts and individual key points did not accept it, and still planned to complete the task according to the date. Finally, in terms of leadership, the county party committee only paid attention to going deep into one key point, and relaxed leadership in other villages, with insufficient leadership assistance and insufficient timely inspection. The second problem is a narrow view of poor peasants and hired laborers, with insufficient attention to the unity of middle peasants, even aversion and exclusion. This time, the cadres going to the countryside did indeed have a poor peasant and hired laborer perspective, going deep into the poor peasants and hired laborers, visiting the poor peasants and hired laborers, and going to the homes of the poor peasants and hired laborers. The poor peasants and hired laborers were very excited and said: "In the past, the workers only went to the homes of the village cadres, but now they come to our homes." The poor peasants and hired laborers responded very well. But they forgot the principle of consolidating the unity of the middle peasants. When entering the village to assign meals, they first told the cadres who assigned meals not to assign meals to the homes of middle peasants. One cadre was assigned to eat at the home of a middle peasant, and when he went there and saw that it was a middle peasant, he refused to eat, got up angrily and left, and went out to find the person who assigned the meal and scolded him: "Why did you assign the meal to the home of a middle peasant? It would be better to assign it to the home of a poor peasant or hired laborer if they are ideologically better." It is common not to eat at the homes of middle peasants. The middle peasants are uneasy, not knowing whether they are still considered peasants, and not knowing what they have become. In the past, people wanted them, but now the workers do not even eat their food. In some places, the propaganda only promotes relying on poor peasants and hired laborers without promoting uniting with middle peasants. They believe that promoting uniting with middle peasants will hinder the mobilization of poor peasants and hired laborers. When investigating and understanding the situation, they do not inquire or investigate the middle peasants, thinking that their words are unreliable and slippery and that they do not tell the truth. When organizing poor peasant leagues, they do not listen to the reflections of the middle peasants. When the poor peasant groups hold meetings, the middle peasants who are listening nearby must be driven away. They believe that not doing so is "a middle peasant line and a capitulationist ideology."

	Blindly Rectifying the Party Lacking Leadership, Some Falling into Sectarian Strife

In mobilizing women's work, at the beginning, attention was not paid to the mobilization of women. There was a theory of first mobilizing men and then mobilizing women. Some believed that women were difficult to mobilize, and even underestimated women. This has been corrected somewhat after the county party committee's notice. Experience has proven that women are very active in participating in the movement. There were three problems in women's work in each village: First, when women participated in the poor peasant leagues, they did not emphasize whether they were exploited by labor, but questioned their corrupt behavior, emphasizing being upright. Those with slightly corrupt behavior were considered not upright. Some district responsible cadres even questioned women in the conference about how many men they had corrupted, where, and who. As a result, many women decreased the next day and did not come to participate in the poor peasant leagues, fearing shame. The second problem is that some places do not emphasize class contradictions, do not put family male-female contradictions under class contradictions to solve, but first emphasize the contradictions with family men and women, causing internal class disputes. Women are afraid to approach workers, and when they approach, they first say: "I am very good with my man." The third problem is that in some places, women and men are mixed in the poor peasant leagues, and as a result, men replace women, they have no voice, and their enthusiasm cannot be inspired. The main problem in party rectification is not recognizing that making the party public and rectifying the party is not a simple technical problem, but a serious political problem, and a cautious and serious attitude must be taken. Therefore, some villages act rashly, not cautiously enough, do not understand the situation, and do not carry out preparation within and outside the party, or the preparation is immature, and they begin party rectification, resulting in collective resistance within the party, the masses outside the party being angered, the leadership being passive, and some are "party members passing the test, workers checking the test, and the masses watching the test," and some fall into sectarian strife.

Therefore, first, the masses inside and outside the party must make full ideological preparations, and only rectify after the situation has matured. Never act lightly if the ideological preparation is not mature. Educate the masses on why the party should be rectified. What attitude should be taken in party rectification? Educate the masses to recognize that without the Communist Party, we cannot be emancipated. We must build a good party and a good branch, and inspire the masses to consciously care for the party. Critically examine party members boldly and responsibly.

The branch should educate and inspire its class consciousness, and be a long-term worker for the people. Today, the party is asking itself to reflect on and correct its mistakes and accept the education of the party and the masses, precisely to care for itself. Inspire them to recognize and reflect on their mistakes, and summon up the courage to accept mass examination. The leaders should treat them with a sincere and caring attitude, not a hostile attitude; in addition, the leaders within the branch must distinguish between good and bad, and must cultivate and develop the backbone of ideological struggle. Party members who do not play a role, but are good in nature and have no work, so the masses have no opinions about them, cannot be satisfied with this. They must seriously reflect on the mistake of not working. The leaders should be responsible for the mistakes of cadres and party members, and should be distinguished, so that they are convinced. Otherwise, they will resist.

Secondly, the mistakes of party members should be treated seriously, distinguishing right from wrong, and not being confused by private revenge and sectarianism. Opinions must be fully developed democratically, allowing the masses to discuss repeatedly until the masses themselves understand, and avoiding impatience. Otherwise, it will either be sectarian emotions protecting cadres and party members and attacking the enthusiasm of the masses, or following the opinions of the masses and excessively attacking cadres and party members. Making the party public must be cautious, explaining that the Communist Party leads the masses to emancipate themselves, explaining the history and work of the branch's development, and explaining why the party was secret in the past and why it is now public, so as not to cause the masses to be used by bad elements and cause blind dissatisfaction with the party.

### 长治检查填补整党工作　纠正急性包办偏向

　　长治检查填补整党工作
  　纠正急性包办偏向
    【本报消息】长治县委对半个月来（三月一日到十五日）填补整党工作作了检查，发现工作中主要毛病是急性病，使工作走了弯路。现将检查情形刊载如下，供各地参考。
    长治全县共有十六个填补整党工作基点村，有八个二类村，七个接近一类村，一个三类村。目前有八个村在整党，其余都在整编群众队伍中。其进行的步骤与方法，除少数村庄外，基本上都是第一步宣传土地法大纲。对各阶层的政策，着重宣传不是打乱平分，只是在过去土改基础上进行调剂土地，及开展民主运动，讲阶级，稳定人心。接着深入贫雇个别访问，并根据调查确定类型村决定方针。判明情况后，则接着进入组织整编群众队伍，组织贫农团，或建立整顿农会，初步就绪，即公开党、审查党员。
    整编群众队伍，是经过思想发动，在群众觉悟的基础上，把群众组织起来，也有的地方一下即成立好贫农团。
    从这一段工作看来，群众提出的问题，最普遍最多的是果实分的不公，不民主，干部作风不好，包庇地主，其中尤以果实分配不公干部作风不自主为最突出；其次是变工帐、错定成份及产粮不公等，一般群众反对的是村上的当权干部，一般看来，支部成份较纯，绝大多数为贫雇，所有基点村尚未发现地富党员。但党员缺乏教育，多数不起作用，有的支部是形式，实际当权者是党外的坏干部与个别坏党员，联合形成村上的统治集团。有的是被党外地主富农操纵，有的即是投机分子当家。各村对非党员干部意见比对党员干部意见多，他们多是反奸清算时的干部，有的被换掉，有的仍当权。
    工作上的主要毛病在于急性病。但有些地方因怕犯错误，想一下把全村情况确实而完整的了解后再行动，进行孤立调查，拖延时间，犯了慢性病。但这不是主要的，主要的是急性病。急性病表现于到村后，不了解情况，只找寻少数贫雇即行动起来，有的区主要负责同志即说，何必了解情况，“群众起来即了解”，采取冒险办法。一区＠埚村，三天组织起贫农小组，四天建立了贫农团，五天整党，六天即陷入街与街的宗派斗争。有的判断情况粗糙，不知贫雇有多少、有多少未翻身，即盲目决定类型村，组织贫农团，并以支部纯与不纯决定贫农团的领导作用；也有按对干部意见多少确定的，盲目组织群众，反对老基础干部支部；有的是按支部好坏来确定成立贫农团，而且是以几个支委的好坏来判断整个支部好坏。整党工作在群众中及党内均不做思想酝酿准备，不教育不启发其阶级觉悟，简单给支部约法三章，也不分清好坏党员。群众中无思想准备教育即整党，结果党员思想不通、抵抗，群众激怒，领导被动，问题不能解决，形成僵局。
    　　　　工作不从实际出发　主观制造轰烈场面
    其原因，主要是干部受过去坏作风的影响，他们不愿细致嫌麻烦，迷恋过去轰轰烈烈的场面。其次是今年春浅，群众害怕误了种地，也要求迅速快，领导思想上也想在春耕前确定地权，以利生产；但不从工作实际情况出发，盲目跟着群众跑。再其次是：鹿家庄会议时，县委确定二十天突破基点，大体整党结束即往外扩展，县委在会后虽有改变，强调不为二十天所限制，但个别区和个别基点未接受，仍计划按日期完成任务。最后，县委领导上只注意深入一个基点，对其他村领导上有些放松，领导帮助不够，及时检查不够。第二个毛病是狭隘的贫雇观点，对中农团结注意不够，甚至厌恶排斥。这次干部下乡确实是有了贫雇观点，深入贫雇，访问贫雇，到贫雇家，贫雇农很兴奋的说：“过去工作员光到村干部家，现在到咱家，”贫雇反映很好。但他们忘了巩固的团结中农的原则，进村派饭，首先告诉派饭的干部不准往中农家派饭。有一个干部派到中农家吃饭，去了一看是个中农，不吃，气冲冲的起来就走，出去找见派饭的大骂一顿：“你为什么派饭派到中农家？派到贫雇家还得思想好一些。”不到中农家吃饭这是普遍的。中农不安，不知咱还算不算农民，不知咱成了啥人，过去人家要咱，现在工作员也不吃咱的饭。宣传上有些地方光宣传依靠贫雇而不宣传团结中农。他们认为宣传中团结中农，会妨害贫雇的发动，调查了解情况不询问、不调查中农，认为他的话不可靠，滑头不说实话，组织贫农团不听中农的反映。贫雇小组开会，中农在旁听还得赶走。他们认为不如此即是“中农路线，投降思想”。
            盲目整宫缺乏领导　有的陷入宗派斗争
    在发动妇女工作上，开始不注意妇女的发动，有先发动男人后发动妇女的理论，有的认为妇女难发动，甚至轻视妇女，经县委通知有所纠正。经验证明，妇女参加运动是很积极的，各村在妇女工作上，曾有三个毛病：第一个妇女参加贫农团，不强调劳动受剥削否，而追问腐化行为，强调正派，稍有腐化行为的即为不正派，甚至有区负责干部在大会追问妇女，腐化过几个男人，什么地方、是谁？结果妇女第二天减少了好多，都不来参加贫农团，怕丢人。第二个毛病，有的地方不强调阶级矛盾，不把家庭男女矛盾放在阶级矛盾之下去解决，而首先强调与家庭男女的矛盾，引起阶级内部纠纷，妇女害怕接近工作员，接近时首先说：“我与我男人很好”。第三个毛病，有的地方贫农团中妇女与男人混合组织，结果男人代替了妇女，她们无言可发，启发不了她们的积极性。整党中的主要毛病，是不认识公开党、整党不是简单的技术问题，而是严重的政治问题，必须采取慎重而又严肃的态度。因此有些村轻率从事，不够慎重，不了解情况，党内党外不进行酝酿准备，或准备不成熟即开始了整党，结果形成党内集体抵抗，党外群众激怒，领导被动，还有的是“党员过关、工作员把关、群众看关”，有的陷于宗派斗争。
    因此首先党内外群众必须作充分思想准备，酝酿成熟再整。思想准备不成熟绝不要轻易行动，在群众中教育为什么要整党？整党应采取什么态度？教育群众认识，没有共产党咱们就不能翻身，必须建设一个好党好支部，启发群众自觉爱护党。大胆负责的批判审查党员。
    支部中应教育、启发其阶级觉悟，为人民当长工，今天党叫自己反省改正错误，接受党与群众的教育，正是为了爱护自己。启发其认识反省自己的错误，鼓起勇气接受群众审查。领导者要对他以诚恳爱护的态度，而不是仇视的态度；另外支部内部领导者要分清好坏，必须培养开展思想斗争的骨干。不起作用的党员，本质好而无工作，因此群众对他无意见的，不能以此满足，要认真反省自己不工作的错误，对干部党员错误，有的应由领导上负责任的，要区别开来，如此他们才服气，不然则抵抗。
    其次对待党员的错误要严肃，分别是非轻重，不要为私人报复闹宗派所迷糊，凡提出意见要充分发扬民主，让群众反复讨论，直到群众自己弄清，切忌急性病。否则不是宗派情绪包庇干部党员打击群众热情，即是跟随群众意见，过分打击干部党员。公开党要慎重，讲明共产党领导群众翻身，说明支部发展的历史与工作，说明党过去为什么秘密，现在为什么公开，如此不致使群众被坏分子利用，引起盲目的对党不满。
