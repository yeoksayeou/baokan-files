Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. TASS reported on the 1st, citing information from well-informed sources in Tokyo published in the Rome newspaper "Republic," fully exposing the US imperialists' wild attempt to occupy Japan long-term and use Japan to invade Eastern peoples. The report stated: As the relevant major powers are about to demand discussions on a Japanese peace treaty, MacArthur's headquarters has secretly concluded an agreement with the reactionary Japanese government. American representatives hinted that the US government is worried about the near-collapse of the political and military situation of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and therefore will not oppose the restoration of Japanese militarist forces. Representatives of the United States and Japan have reached the following agreement: After the peace treaty comes into effect, the Japanese government: 1. Should lease the Ryukyu Islands and Tsushima Island to the United States for a period of sixty-six years and should allow the United States to establish military bases in Kyushu and Hokkaido; 2. Should grant the United States exclusive rights to invest in Japan's primary and secondary industries; 3. Should cede Japanese property and investments in Latin America to the United States. In exchange, the US side will support the following Japanese proposals at the peace conference: 1. Preserve and expand existing Japanese industrial equipment; 2. Allow Japan to import raw materials necessary for industry; 3. Remove any restrictions on Japan's important industries and foreign trade; 4. Japanese property abroad and current industrial products (including coal, oil, and chemical fertilizers, etc.) are exempt from reparations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Moscow dispatch: The Soviet "News" reported on the 29th of last month, commenting on the reactionary new Ashida cabinet in Japan, stating: After Katayama's downfall, democratic groups demanded new parliamentary elections. However, the reactionaries and MacArthur's headquarters were afraid of the failure of the reactionary parties and insisted that the old parliament controlled by the reactionaries appoint a new prime minister. The new prime minister, Ashida, is a fickle and capricious politician and is the most suitable running dog for US expansionists. MacArthur's headquarters put Ashida in office entirely to turn Japan into a US dependency. But MacArthur and his American running dogs cannot underestimate the nascent power of Japan. The US attempt to trample on Japanese independence is encountering unprecedentedly huge resistance from the Japanese democratic movement.

　　美帝想长期占领日本
  　作侵略东方民族基地
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社一日引罗马“共和报”刊载东京消息灵通方面透露之情报，充分暴露美帝长期占领日本及其利用日本侵略东方民族的狂妄企图。该报载称：值有关大国将要求讨论日本和约之际，麦克阿瑟总部已与日本反动政府秘密缔结协定，美国代表暗示，美国政府忧虑蒋贼已近崩溃之政治、军事情况，因而将不反对日本军国主义势力的恢复。美日两国代表已达成下列协议：日本政府于和约生效后，一、应将琉球群岛和对马岛租予美国，为期六十六年，并应允美国在九洲及北海道建立军事基地；二、应予美国投资于日本主要及次要工业的独占权；三、应将日本在拉丁美洲的财产和投资让予美国。美国方面则在对日和会上支持日本下列建议，作为交换条件：一、保存并扩大现有的日本工业装备；二、允许日本输进工业所必需之原料；三、取消对日本重要工业和对外贸易的任何限制；四、日本在国外的财产和目前的工业产品（包括煤、石油及化学肥料等等）免充赔偿之用等。
    【新华社陕北四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联消息报上月廿九日评日本芦田反动新内阁称：民主团体于片山倒台后，曾要求举行新议会选举，但反动派和麦克阿瑟总部都害怕反动党派失败，坚持由反动派把持的旧议会任命新首相，新首相芦田是朝三暮四变化多端的政客，是美扩张主义者最适用的走狗，麦氏总部之所以使芦田就职，完全为了将日本变为美国的附庸。但麦克阿瑟和美国走狗们，都不能轻视日本新生的力量，美国蹂躏日本独立的企图，正遭遇到日本民主运动空前巨大的反抗。
