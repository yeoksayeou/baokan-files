Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan, March 5th: The Yu Wan Su People's Armed Forces, in the week from February 15th to 21st, conducted a mopping-up campaign in the areas of Luyi, Zhecheng, Taikang, and Guoyang, eliminating a total of over 2,700 local Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In early February, after Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Reorganized Division was forced to flee north, local Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the five counties of Huaiyang, Taikang, Luyi, Shenqiu, and Xiangcheng fled north towards Shangqiu. Our army immediately pursued them in separate routes. On the 16th, we recovered Luyi County, and on the 19th, we captured Zhecheng, eliminating over 500 members of the Zhecheng County Security Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. On the 20th, a total of over 8,000 local Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the five counties and the defeated Chiang Kai-shek bandits from Zhecheng gathered again in the area north of Zhecheng and fled south in five routes. They were intercepted by our army in the area west of Hu Xiangji (30 li northeast of Zhecheng), where over 1,100 were eliminated. The rest retreated eastward, westward, and northward. That night, our army continued to pursue and eliminated over 500 more at Guo Village, 30 li southwest of Shangqiu. On the 21st, we surrounded the Bo County Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who were fleeing south, at the Foye Temple south of Yimenji in northwestern Guoyang. After eight hours of fierce fighting, over 100 bandits were killed and over 400 were captured alive. After this annihilating blow, these local Chiang Kai-shek bandits all retreated to the vicinity of the Shangqiu strongholds along the Longhai Railway and dared not leave easily. This mopping-up campaign resulted in the recovery of the two county towns of Luyi and Zhecheng, the capture alive of over 1,900 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, including the magistrate and deputy magistrate of Zhecheng, the killing and wounding of over 700 bandits, and the seizure of one mortar, four heavy machine guns, over 30 light machine guns, over 1,800 rifles, 93 mules and horses, and a portion of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Front, March 5th: On February 28th, a reconnaissance unit of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army encountered a part of the 45th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Reorganized Division south of Minquan City on the Longhai Railway. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy cavalry and tanks that charged our army were defeated. One enemy tank was destroyed, two enemy soldiers were captured, and three war horses and one carbine were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu Shan E Front, March 5th: In the past two months, a certain battalion of the East Line People's Liberation Army has assisted local armed forces in suppressing bandits on the south bank of the Ru River in the Fifth Military District, fighting bandits 15 times, capturing Linru County, and eliminating and capturing nearly 700 bandits below the level of security regiment commander. Two mortars, four light and heavy machine guns, and 386 various guns were seized. The battalion only suffered one serious injury, creating a combat model of one to seven hundred. In addition to helping establish a part of the local armed forces, the battalion itself has doubled in size. The leaders of the column sent a special telegram to commend all units.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, March 5th: A part of the People's Liberation Army, combined with local armed forces, launched a surprise attack on four companies of the 3rd Regiment of the Mongolian Bandit Police Division, who had invaded Wuzhai Bay (northwest of Fugou, in Suiyuan), on the morning of February 25th. After half an hour of fighting, all the bandits were defeated, 93 people including the company commander were captured, 19 were killed or wounded, and two American-made light machine guns, 75 long and short guns, and 21 war horses were seized. At the same time, Wuzhai Bay was recovered, and the remaining bandits fled.
