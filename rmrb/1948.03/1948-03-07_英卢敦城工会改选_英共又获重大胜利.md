  　Another Major Victory for the British Communist Party
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 5th: London, March 3rd: In the re-election of various unions in Luton, northwest of London, the British Communist Party has achieved another major victory. In the city's largest "Vauxhall" car factory, the well-known Communist Party members Horne and Ed were re-elected as secretary and chairman of the factory's workshop representative committee, respectively. The secretary of the workshop committee of another factory in the city was also elected by the Communist Party member Mitchell. Communist Party member Roon was elected secretary of the bus group of the city's transportation and various industries union. Communist Party member Morton was re-elected as secretary of the Luton Workers' Committee. Communist Party members account for three seats in the election of the union's executive committee.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 5th: London: A political observer for the Times recently announced: the Labour Party's anti-communist movement "has so far failed to make any change in the general comparison of forces." The newspaper admitted that the Labour Party's attempt had failed in the union re-election movement; at the same time, it pointed out that many Labour Party union leaders were greatly disappointed as a result.
