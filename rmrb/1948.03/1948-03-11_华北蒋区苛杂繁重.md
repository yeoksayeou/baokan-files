Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. A comprehensive report: In the Kuomintang-controlled areas of various provinces in North China, taxes and levies are exorbitant and heavy, and the people are rising up in resistance. In the counties occupied by the KMT bandits in Hebei, all the rice subsidies for officials and police officers in county-level agencies are extracted from the people. From March to the end of last year in Luan County, including the affiliated agencies and "self-defense forces" rice subsidies, the entire county extorted more than 100,000 dan of millet. In Ninghe, the rice subsidies are collected in KMT currency. In January of this year, when the price of corn flour in the county was 10,000 yuan per jin, the county government ordered collection at 13,000 yuan per jin. The people of Lutai Town under the county rose up in protest, and it was then changed back to 10,000 yuan per jin. In Jinghai County, due to the excessive taxes and levies, many people fled to distant places to avoid them, so that the rice subsidies for November and December of last year had not been collected by January of this year. In the Xin'an Township area of Xiuwu County, Henan, each mu of land bore more than one dan of grain and more than 200,000 yuan of KMT currency last year. The expenses and fodder for the pseudo self-defense forces and Bao-Gong offices were not included. In January of this year, each mu was again levied 2.7 dou of grain and 20,000 yuan in currency. The people locked their doors to evade corvée labor. Many Bao-Jia chiefs were detained by the KMT bandits for failing to hand in the grain and money on time. Recently, in Nanlezhuang, several families were forced to jump into wells. The people of Jiale Village rose up to save themselves, drove away three grain-robbing bandits from the Fourth Special Commissioner's Office Security Regiment of the KMT bandits, and wounded one of them. In the Fenyang and Xiaoyi areas under the KMT bandit rule in Shanxi, the taxes and levies are extraordinarily heavy, and many farmers abandon their land and flee for their lives. In Xiaoyi City, the night soil from the toilets of the shops, which farmers used to scramble to collect for fertilizer during the democratic regime, is now unwanted even if the shops are willing to pay 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month.

　　华北蒋区苛杂繁重
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合报导：华北各省蒋匪统治区苛杂繁重，人民纷起反抗。河北蒋匪盘踞各县县级机关官吏警役米贴，全部向民间掠取。滦县自去年三月到年底，连附属机关和“自卫队”米贴在内，全县搜刮小米十余万担。宁河米贴系折收蒋币，今年一月该县玉米面每斤售价一万元时，该县县政府竟下令按每斤一万三千元征收。县属芦台镇人民纷起抗议，才又改为每斤一万元。静海县因苛杂太重，人民多远出躲避，致去年十一、十二两月份米贴，到今年一月还未收到。河南修武县新安乡一带，去年每亩地负担粮食一担多，蒋币廿多万元，伪自卫队、保公所的花销及草料尚不在内，今年一月份每亩又派粮二斗七升，款子两万元，老百姓锁门躲差，保甲长不能按时交齐粮款，多被蒋匪拘押，最近南乐庄，有几家老百姓则被逼跳井。嘉乐村老百姓奋起自救，打跑蒋匪第四专署保安团三个抢粮匪徒，并打伤其中一人。山西蒋匪统治的汾阳、孝义一带苛杂奇重，农民多弃地逃生。孝义城内商店厕所的粪便，在民主政权时期农民争着挑去肥地，现在虽然商店愿意每月倒贴三四万，也没有农民去挑粪了。
