　　Promote Party Rectification and Democracy Based on Village Characteristics
   　Duzhuang Establishes New Farmers' Association
    [Wuan News] The democratic party rectification and land reform work in Duzhuang Village, Second District, began on February 24th. First, a mass meeting was held, where Commissioner Hou personally explained the Land Law, providing strong support to the masses. After the meeting, the masses freely gathered to discuss. Ma Jiabao (poor peasant) said: Our village cadres took off their fur coats last winter because they heard about the Program. Man Cang (poor peasant) said: The district asked him to publicize it, but he didn't dare because he had already turned himself over too highly. The village originally had a fake poor peasant league last winter, and its internal organization was extremely impure. Waiting for the arrival of the district work team, the commissioner's office first began investigating and individually interviewing poor and hired peasants to prepare.
    The village has 207 households, with a population of 852 men and women, and 4,110.09 mu of irrigated and dry land, averaging 4.824 mu of land per person and an average yield of 3.4 shi per person. After the Double Reduction, anti-traitor liquidation, and land reform movements, 70% of the poor and hired peasants have turned themselves over, while 30% have not turned themselves over sufficiently or thoroughly. In various movements, a total of 35 households were struggled against in the village. Landlords and old rich peasants no longer exist, feudalism has been eliminated relatively thoroughly, and land is generally equal, therefore it is classified as a Class II village.
    The characteristics of this village are: 1. It is three li from the city. Before liberation, city landlords occupied about 2,500 mu of land, and the village's landlords and rich peasants, 18 households, occupied 600 mu, accounting for 75% of the village's land; middle and poor peasants only had more than 10 qing, accounting for 25% of the village's land. Only six landlord households in the village did not rent land from city landlords, while the remaining 200-plus households rented land to varying degrees.
    2. Movable property was distributed extremely unfairly. In the past, the distribution was based on rewarding active participation. In addition to openly occupying more, many were stolen privately. As a result, most of the movable property was taken by cadres and militiamen. For example, senior cadres each had fur coats, and the public security director took two good blankets for himself. Of the 29 head of livestock, cadres and activists took 22, the cooperative took 2, and the masses only got 5. The masses had to pay for the livestock they wanted, but the village chief's livestock and carts were not paid for at all. The masses urgently demanded an equal distribution of movable property.
    3. Undemocratic work style and unfair burdens. Many poor and hired peasants in the village were penalized or struggled against for expressing opinions. A poor hired peasant, Yang Sanze, was expelled from his home for killing a chicken belonging to a veteran; Ma Tang's wife was detained for an afternoon and expelled from the farmers' association for giving the public security officer an opinion. Statistics show that 11 middle and poor peasant households were wrongly struggled against in the village. The reasons for the struggle were: deserting from the army, not lending things, air-raid shelters, puppet personnel, corruption, etc., and property was always taken away during the struggle. Therefore, these 11 households have not reached the average level of the village today. In terms of burden, the cadres' official rice (rice earned for office work) alone amounted to more than 6,000 jin, and the burden on the masses was too heavy. For example, Man Cang produced 3 shi of grain last year and had to pay 204 jin of official rice.
    Due to the above characteristics, the village's policy was determined to be party rectification, democracy, equal distribution of movable property, and adjustment of land. On March 2nd, the district work team arrived, and together with six comrades from the commissioner's office, formed a joint work team, which officially began work.
    The work team began by not relying on the more than 40 poor and hired peasants already organized in the village, but instead conducted individual interviews. They found Xiao Mancang, whom they initially considered reliable because he had the conditions of year-round labor and a poor family, but later discovered that he took the upper-level route. They found poor peasant Ma Tianxiang, but he was outside and knew nothing about the village's affairs. Later, after comparing information from several sources, they looked for real poor and hired peasants and found Yang Xiaohang, Yang Yuanqing, and Zhao @suo (two poor and one middle), and worked with them to study the village's situation. Based on their opinions, they identified the ten most honest people in the village. Fearing bias, they also learned from the good cadres and then combined family visits with the individuals themselves, thus clearly identifying who were truly honest poor and hired peasants and finding a reliable base. After connecting and mobilizing, on March 3rd, they formed a poor peasant group, elected a group leader, and discussed development standards. The next day, it grew to 24 people, becoming a basic force.
    After the poor peasant group was formed, they studied the village's situation and felt that their strength was isolated and requested unity with the middle peasants, brewing the establishment of a new farmers' association. On the evening of the 7th, a meeting of all middle and poor peasants in the village was held. At the meeting, Ma Jiabao, Jia Erlin, and others initiated the establishment of a new farmers' association. The masses examined the composition and history of these ten initiators, and then democratically discussed the membership conditions at the meeting. A poor peasant (blind man) Jia Conggui said: This time we can't be careless, the establishment of the new farmers' association is to set up a new world. After the meeting, the poor and hired peasants felt that the farmers' association was very important, and the next day, before dawn, ten of them automatically gathered together to discuss the method of recruiting members: waiting at the door of a courtyard, not allowing anyone to enter, and examining each person to see if they were qualified before notifying them in the evening. At that time, the work team found a problem and immediately suggested that mystification was not good and that it was easy for a few people to be in charge. The poor peasant group did not accept the suggestion even after it was raised three times, so they had no choice but to follow along for a day. When the masses voted in the evening, they found that three people were not qualified. It took three nights and one day to complete the examination. The examination method was that each person first introduced their background, history, and composition, and then the members voted. Everyone was very serious when passing each person. For example, when examining Jiang @gui, he did not say that he had stolen someone's clothes in the past, so it was brought up. The result of the examination was 119 male members, including 5 extremely poor, 59 poor peasants, 24 new middle peasants, 25 middle peasants, and 8 hired laborers; among the male members, there were two Communist Party members. There were 90 female members, including 4 extremely poor, 54 poor peasants, 18 middle peasants, and 14 new middle peasants. A total of 209 farmers formed a large army. Ten people were unqualified, including 4 middle peasants, 5 poor peasants, and 1 hired laborer. The proposal for these ten people was to leave them for review, not to reject them outright, and to say: You should think carefully, and then talk about it when you understand.
    For example, when examining Zhao Lianze, everyone said: He is a rogue, eats struggle meals, and does not work. His parents have nothing to eat, and he buys sesame oil candy to feed the dogs, so he should think about it. He seemed very frustrated. On March 11th, the Duzhuang New Farmers' Association was officially established. At the general membership meeting, farmers' association committee members were elected. A total of 24 people were nominated, and the best were selected from the good ones, entirely by voting. When writing the votes, the villagers who could not write asked the staff members to write for them, but not other villagers. The staff member wrote it and had to read it aloud to the person. As a result of such a democratic and serious election, Ma Jiabao, Jia Yinzong, Jia Erlin, and other nine people were elected. Among the committee members, there were two middle peasants, four new middle peasants, and three poor peasants. Everyone believed that the democracy of this meeting was the first in Duzhuang Village, and the people elected were the most honest and fair. Finally, the party was made public at the meeting, the list of branch party members was announced, and representatives from the farmers' association were invited to participate in the branch meeting to carry out party rectification.

　　根据全村特点推进整党民主
   　杜庄成立新农会
    【武安消息】二区杜庄村，民主整党填补工作，从二月二十四日开始，首先召开了群众大会，由侯专员亲在大会上宣讲土地法，并给群众有力的撑腰，会后，群众即自由结合开会商讨，马家保（贫农）说：咱村干部去冬脱皮袄，就是听到大纲才脱的。满仓（贫农）说：区上叫他宣传他不敢宣传，就是因为自己翻身太高。该村去冬原组织有假贫雇团，内部极不纯。为等区工作组来人，专署即先着手调查、个别访问贫雇作准备。
    该村二百零七户，男女人口八百五十二口，水旱地四千一百一十亩零九分，每人平均地四·八二四亩，每人平均应产量三·四石，经过双减、反奸清算、土改运动后，贫雇农百分之七十已翻身，而有百分之三十是翻身不足或不算透。在各个运动中，全村共斗争三十五户，地主、旧富农已不存在，封建消灭较为彻底，土地大体相平，因此确定为二类村。
    这个村特点是：一、距城三里。在解放前被城里地主占有地约二千五百亩，本村地主富农十八户，占有六百亩，占全村土地百分之七十五；中贫农仅有十顷多，占全村百分之二十五。全村只有六户地主不租城里地主的地，其余二百多户，都有或多或少的租地。
    二、浮财分的极不公道。过去订分，按积极程度奖励，除公开多占外，还私偷了好多，结果大部浮财被干部民兵占去了。如大干部每人都有皮袄，公安主任一个人分两个好毯子，牲口共二十九头，干部积极分子占去二十二头，合作社二头，群众仅得到五头。群众要的牲口都出了钱，村长的牲口、车根本没出钱，群众思想急于要求匀浮财。
    三、作风不民主，负担不公道。该村贫雇因提意见被扣、被斗者不少。一个贫雇杨三则，因打死退伍军人一只鸡，即被扫地出门；马堂女人因给公安员提意见，即扣了一下午，还开除农会。统计该村错斗中贫农十一户，斗争的理由是：参战开小差、有物不借、防空洞、伪人员、腐化等，每斗必动财产。因此这十一户，今天都达不到全村水平，在负担上仅干部工米（办公赚米）就六千多斤，群众负担太重，如满仓去年打了三石谷，即出了二百零四斤工米。
    由于以上特点，确定该村方针是整党、民主、匀浮财、调剂土地。三月二日区工作队来人，和专署六个同志共同组织了联合工作组，即正式开始工作。
    工作组开始对该村已组织的四十多个贫雇，都不敢靠，即进行个别访问，找到小满仓，当时认为他可靠，有常年劳动、家庭贫苦的条件，但他串连不起别人，后来调查他走上层路线。找到贫农马天祥，因在外，村里事一点不懂。后来又从几方面对照，去找真正的贫雇，找到了杨小杭、杨元庆、赵＠锁三个人，（二贫一中）和他们共同研究，全村数谁最老气，从他们意见里，提出了十个。又怕片面，又从好的干部方面去了解，然后找本人再结合全家访，这样明确的肯定了谁是真正老实贫雇，找到了依靠。经串连发动，在三月三日就组成贫农小组，选出了组长，并讨论了发展标准，第二天就发展到二十四人，成为了基本力量。
    贫农团组成后，研究了本村的情况，感到力量孤不行，要求团结中农，酝酿成立新农会。在七号晚召开了全村中贫农会议，会上先由马家保、贾二林等十人发起成立新农会，群众审查了这十个发起人的成份历史，继即在大会上民主的讨论会员条件，一个贫农（瞎子）贾从贵说：这次可不能马虎，成立新农会是安新世界哩。散会后，贫雇感到农会十分重要，第二天天还未明，他十个人就自动凑到一块了，讨论吸收会员的办法：是在一个院里门上等着，不准进，一个个审查合格，晚上再通。当时工作组发现有毛病，随即提出意见说神秘化不好，容易少数人当家，连提三次，贫农团不接受，没法只好跟着进行了一天，晚上群众通过时，又发现三个人不够格。共三个晚上一整天的时间，才审查完毕。审查方法，先由个人介绍自己出身、历史、成份后，再经会员通过的方式，在通过每人的时候，大家非常认真。如在审查江＠贵时，他在过去偷过人家一件衣服没有说，就给他提出来了。审查结果，男会员一百一十九个，内赤贫五、贫农五十九、新中农二十四、中农二十五、雇工八人；男数内有共产党员二名。女会员九十个，赤贫四、贫农五十四、中农十八、新中农十四。共组成二百零九名的农民大军。不合格者十人，中农四、贫农五、雇工一人。对这十个人是留待审查的方案，而不是干脆拒绝，提出：你们好好想想，想通再说。
    如审查赵连则时，大家提出：他流氓、吃斗争饭、不劳动，他爹娘没啥吃，他买下香油麻糖光喂狗，叫他想想。他就显的很丧气。三月十一日，杜庄新农会正式成立。全体会员大会上，进行选举农会委员，共提出二十四人，好的里边挑好的，完全用票选，在写票时本村人不会写的，都是找的工作员，不找本村人。工作员给写了，还得对面念一遍。在这样民主认真的选举结果，马家保、贾银忠、贾二林等九人当选了。委员中有中农二人、新中农四人、贫农三人。大家都认为这个会的民主是杜庄村的第一次，选出的人最老气、最公道。最后在大会上公开了党，宣布了支部党员名单，邀请农会选派代表，参加支部会，进行整党。（杜庄工作组）
