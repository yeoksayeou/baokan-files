　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 25th: Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu's commentary on the 20th of this month, stating: As the Kuomintang army suffers new military defeats, the US Congress is discussing military aid to Chiang, and the US is actively reviving Japanese militarism, the Kuomintang has recently strengthened its anti-Soviet slanders, ordering its puppet, the so-called National Political Council, to collect all the despicable anti-Soviet rumors that have long been exposed, pass anti-Soviet resolutions, and madly bark the hackneyed tune of "the Soviet Union aids the Chinese Communist Party." The purpose of the reactionaries in fabricating these rumors is to cover up the Kuomintang's military defeats (such as the loss of strategic cities like Yongji) and to conceal their traitorous behavior of auctioning off the military, political, and economic sovereignty of the Kuomintang-controlled areas and selling out the survival interests of the Chinese nation on the Japanese issue in exchange for the US imperialism's implementation of military aid.

  　再斥蒋匪反苏叫嚣
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】本月二十日莫斯科电台广播马西努评论称：当着国民党军遭受新的军事惨败，美国会正在讨论军事援蒋和美国正积极复兴日本军国主义之际，国民党最近又加强了反苏诽谤，命令其御用的所谓国民参政会，搜集了一切早已被揭穿的卑鄙的反苏谣言，通过反苏的决议，狂吠“苏联援助中国共产党”的滥调。反动派制造这些谣言的目的，是为国民党的军事惨败（如丧失象永吉这类的战略城市）遮羞，并掩盖他们拍卖国民党区军事、政治、经济主权，和在日本问题上出卖中国民族生存利益，以换得美帝国主义实行军事援助的卖国行为。
