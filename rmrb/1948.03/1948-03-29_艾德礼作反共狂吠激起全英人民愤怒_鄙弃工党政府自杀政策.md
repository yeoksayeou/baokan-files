Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—London Dispatch: Attlee's anti-communist statement, made under orders to purge Communist Party members from British government agencies, continues to provoke protests from the broad masses of British people, writers, and many members of Parliament. On the 20th, the resolution of the Stepney Trades Council in London, representing 6,000 workers, emphasized that the government's anti-communist policy aims to oppose all kinds of freedoms of the British people and attack the democratic rights of the labor movement. The Glasgow Building Workers Local Union also passed a similar resolution. The famous musician Robertson expressed strong opposition, saying: Nothing can make me agree with Attlee's policy. The writer Goldring said: The purpose of Attlee's policy is "to turn Britain into a fascist police state under American control," and "millions of people who oppose the government's disastrous policies will be subjected to police oppression and persecution as a result." The writer Marshall said: Every time I think of the Labor government selling our country to foreign capitalist countries for enslavement, "I can't help but tremble with anger." Zilliacus also pointed out on the 17th that the government's attempt to eliminate Communist officials is obeying the orders of American imperialism. More than forty Labor MPs and several MPs from other parties condemned the government's action on the 19th as running counter to the principles of democracy and civil liberties.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th—London Dispatch: Since Attlee issued a reactionary statement purging Communist Party members from British government agencies, the protest movement has spread throughout Britain. On the 21st, at a mass protest meeting in Manchester, 100 people announced their joining the British Communist Party in response to Attlee's anti-communist statement. The National Action Committee of the Engineering and Allied Trades Union resolved: Anti-communism is not only related to progressive civil servants, but also to all people belonging to left-wing political parties. The executive committee of the London Carriage Workers Union demanded that the government withdraw Attlee's anti-communist statement. On the 23rd, the executive committee of the Tobacco Workers Union expressed its anger at Attlee's anti-communist statement, denouncing it as an infringement on political rights and civil liberties. White, General Secretary of the Civil Servants Union, also said at the annual meeting of the National Council for Civil Liberties in London on the same day: "Taking away our civil liberties is already terrible, but what's worse is that our civil liberties are being taken away at the instigation of the United States." The annual meeting resolved to angrily condemn Attlee's anti-communist statement of political discrimination and demanded its complete withdrawal. Professor Haltani said: Attlee's anti-communism is establishing a "Gestapo" (secret police) in Britain. Professor Holman Levine said: Anti-communism shows: "We are frantically and confusedly following the United States on the road to war and the Labor Party's suicide." Two famous actresses, Burke and Lehman, called on the theater and film industry to reject the government's anti-communist roundup. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, wrote an article in the Workers' Daily on the 21st, sharply condemning the Attlee government for purging communists, and criticizing the church for blindly following the anti-communist movement. He said: "Powerful people persuaded me to sever ties with the Communist Party's newspaper, Workers' Daily, but they failed because of my refusal, and they will still not succeed in the future." There was also widespread dissatisfaction within the Labor Party with Attlee's anti-communism. On the 21st, left-wing Labor MP Zilliacus said at the Birmingham Labor Party Local Committee: "Anti-communism will create conditions of tension, fear, economic crisis and unease, lead to war, and poison all the countries involved." Labor figure Todleyburg wrote in Reynolds News on the 23rd: "During the seven rallies where I gave speeches during my visit to Bristol, I discovered a strong anti-anti-communist atmosphere." He added: "Anti-communism aroused fear and anger among the people. I firmly believe that there will be no war, and I oppose those who believe that war is bound to break out and conduct the abominable preview—the purge of communists."

　　艾德礼作反共狂吠激起全英人民愤怒
  　鄙弃工党政府自杀政策
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】伦敦讯：艾德礼奉命清洗英政府机关中共产党员的反共声明，继续激起英国广大人民、作家及许多议员的抗议。二十日，代表六千职工的伦敦斯泰普尼工会委员会的决议中，着重指出：政府的反共方针，在于反对英国人民各种自由，攻击劳工运动的民主权利。格拉斯哥建筑工人地方工会亦通过相似的决议。著名音乐家洛伯尔森表示强烈反对说：没有任何东西能使我同意艾德礼的政策。作家高得林称：艾德礼政策的目的，“是要把英国变成美国控制下的法西斯警察国”，“千百万反对政府灾难性政策的人们，都将因而受到警察的欺压与迫害。”作家马夏尔说：每当想到工党政府把我国出卖给外国资本主义国家去奴役时，“我不禁气得浑身发抖”。齐里亚库斯亦于十七日指出：政府清除共产党官员的企图，是服从美帝命令。工党议员四十余人及其他党派议员数人，十九日谴责政府此一行动是与民主及公民自由原则背道而驰。
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】伦敦讯：自从艾德礼发出清洗英政府机关中共产党员反动声明后，抗议运动已扩及全英。廿一日，曼彻斯特举行群众抗议大会时，会上一百人宣布加入英共，以回答艾德礼的反共声明。机器及附属业工会全国行动委员会决议：反共不仅关系到进步的公务员，而且关系到一切属于左翼政党的人们。伦敦马车工会执委会要求政府收回艾德礼反共声明。廿三日，烟草工人联盟执委会的决议对艾德礼反共声明表示愤怒，痛斥它是对政治权利与公民自由的侵犯。公务员工会总书记怀特亦于同日在伦敦全国公民自由委员会年会上说：“把我们的公民自由夺走已经坏透了，可是，比这更坏的是我们的公民自由是在美国的唆使下被夺走的。”该年会决议怒责艾德礼政治歧视的反共声明，要求完全收回该声明。哈尔坦尼教授说：艾德礼的反共是在英国建立“盖斯特波”（秘密警察）。荷曼·莱文教授说：反共显示了：“我们慌张错乱地跟着美国向战争与工党的自杀道路上前进”。两位著名女演员布尔克和丽曼，号召戏剧与电影界拒绝政府的反共大搜捕。坎特伯利主教约翰生二十一日在工人日报上撰文，尖锐谴责艾德礼政府清洗共产党人，并指斥教会盲从反共运动。他说：“有势力的人劝我与共产党机关报工人日报断绝关系，但因我的拒绝而使他们失败了，将来他们也还是不会成功。”工党内部对艾德礼反共亦纷表不满。二十一日，左翼工党议员齐里亚库斯于伯明翰工党地方委员会上说：“反共将造成紧张、恐惧、经济危机与不安的条件，引起战争，毒害一切被卷入的国家”。工党人士托德里堡则于二十三日在雷诺新闻上写道：“在我游访布利斯托尔期间发表演说的七次集会上，我发觉了强烈的反对反共的气氛。”他又说：“反共激起了人们的恐惧与愤怒。我深信不会有战争，我反对那些认为战争必将爆发而进行的可恶的预演——清共。”
