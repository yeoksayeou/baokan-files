　　Sanwang Village Grasps Masses' Urgent Demands
　　Party Rectification Democracy Forms Climax
　　[News from our newspaper] Sanwang Village is a model village in the ninth district of Wu'an. According to the results of this class division: among 168 households (not including those who were struggled against), middle peasants account for 80% of the total number of households, with new middle peasants dominating. Poor and hired peasants account for less than 15% of the total number of households. Feudalism has long been eliminated, landlords and rich peasants have changed their class status, the land is basically leveled, with an average of about three mu per person and an average yield of 28 dou. This simple outline generally conforms to the first type of village mentioned in the central government's work instructions for old and semi-old liberated areas.
　　　　Bad Party Members Form Cliques, Commit Evil, and Suppress the Masses
　　The most urgent demand of the peasants in this village is democracy. For several years, they have been unable to breathe under the oppression of several key bad party members in the branch. As many as 80 "special agent" hats have been put on people for the sole purpose of revenge and framing (some people have worn them several times). Forty people have been hung up and beaten. Everyone in the village is in constant fear and dare not talk to each other. Seven or eight households have requested to move. Old middle peasants are extremely panicked. More than 20 of them have been wrongly struggled against, and those who have not been struggled against are afraid that they will be struggled against one day. New middle peasants feel that the fruits of their liberation are not secure, and they may be labeled as special agents and taken away one day. Poor and hired peasants are regarded as "backward" and "hopeless" by the cadres. As soon as they complain, they are accused of being special agents and spreading sabotage. Under such a terrifying dictatorship by a minority, a street clique relationship has developed: there are more cadres and more party members in the front street. The back street has only two party members (they are excluded by the bad party members), and now there is not a single cadre in power. The vast majority of people have been labeled as "special agents". Many people in the back street regard the rule of a few bad cadres as the front street oppressing the back street. A few bad cadres also use this blind emotion of the masses to create opposition, ease the emotions of the masses, and shift the target. In fact, the root of all these mistakes is a few anti-people cliques in the branch: among them is the brother party headed by Li Xinggui (Li is now working in Wu'an Yongmaochang, formerly the director of the village armed committee) (three brothers are party members and commit evil), and the family party headed by branch secretary Yang Shouan (family brothers are all party members). These cliques, headed by Li Xinggui and Yang Shouan, suppressed the masses from all directions.
　　The Sanwang Village work team, based on the experience gained in Zhao Village of conducting work according to the demands of the masses, understood this basic situation of the village after arriving in the village and determined that the starting point of the work was to meet the people's democratic demands, and the key lay in implementing open mass party rectification. In the past ten days, Sanwang Village has formed a climax of a party rectification democratic movement, and the masses have been initially mobilized.
　　　　Open Party Members Accept Review, Divide Class Status, Peasants Take Charge
　　From the performance of the movement, it can be roughly divided into three stages: The first stage is to make systematic preparations for the movement ideologically and organizationally. This includes: making all party members public, the district party secretary and district head all made self-criticisms, breaking the masses' "fear of retaliation" after washing faces and wiping out blacks. The work team emphasized that the party branch of Sanwang Village should accept the supervision of the people of Sanwang Village, and the 25 party members should be reviewed by the masses, and those who have made mistakes should be given the opportunity to correct their mistakes and reform. The second is to divide class status, which is also combined with democratic demands. At that time, it was proposed: "Divide class status well, find a position, stand in line, and take charge of the house." For middle peasants, the five specific policies of Chairman Mao to consolidate and unite middle peasants were publicized to break the "fear of struggle" thinking. For poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants, it was emphasized that they are the leading backbone. The masses were extremely enthusiastic. They said: "In the past, who knew who was what class, the cadres said what it was." "Whoever has a little bit of power is a landlord." Class division enabled all peasants to obtain the legitimate power to take charge of the house. Whenever a peasant self-reported and publicly discussed his class status, the staff member would pick up the class division standard and read it to everyone, explaining that class status can only be assessed based on each person's possession of means of production and production relations, and there can be no other standards. Immediately, there was a burst of happy laughter. They said, "This method is really detailed." An old middle peasant said: "This is Chairman Mao's 'all-round' way to find a bright road for the people." Precisely because class division was combined with the masses' demand to be masters, everyone behaved unusually seriously, and people who did not work but specialized in struggle were exposed. Self-reports that were not practical were corrected. Some "insider information" among the masses (such as households eating from several households' inherited land or substitute cultivation land, etc.) was also revealed. After a class division, the masses' ranks were initially rectified, and the masses had a further demand to organize. Therefore, based on the camp after class division, a political standard was proposed to the masses, namely: laboring year-round, being upright, selfless, and enthusiastic about doing things for the masses, and conducting group discussions. Everyone from poor and hired peasants to old middle peasants underwent a review, which the masses called "clearing the bottom". Nearly 20 peasants who met the four standards were cleared out, with poor peasants and new middle peasants accounting for the majority. In addition, truly laboring and upright peasants were also cleared out, most of whom met two or three conditions. This political review improved the class consciousness of the peasants, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out. Zhang Liutang had an affair with a married woman, which affected the internal unity of the peasants, and was rated as having three and a half conditions. He expressed his determination to reform. In this way, the peasant interior was purified, and leaders who were sincerely loved by them were produced. Those who were unanimously approved by each group became the initiators of the new peasant association.
　　The economic investigation of class status and the political investigation of conditions fully prepared all peasants to be masters of the house democratically, laying a solid foundation for the smooth development of future work.
　　　　The Masses' Eyes Are Sharp, Good and Bad Party Members Are Clearly Distinguished
　　　　Strictly Stipulate Democratic Order, No Hanging, No Beating, No Random Root-Tracing
　　The second stage is the formation of the movement from small to large. At the general meeting to review and approve the initiators, two party members were reviewed: Xing Zhengguo, a party member supported by the masses, was smoothly passed, allowing him to stand with the masses to rectify those bad ones, but the masses still maintained strict criticism of him, saying that he "is a good person, but not good enough to be a good party member", "Your struggle in the party is not strong, that is, your spirit of serving the people is not enough." He was encouraged to improve his fighting spirit and be a good long-term worker for the people. Another party member, Wang Yuzhen, who did not have major problems, was not passed. The masses asked him, "How many years have you been in the party?" He said, "Four years." The masses said: "Xing Zhengguo joined the party for half a year, and it is understandable that he did not understand the details, but you are an old party member, how can you be so sloppy? Bad party members are so messy, why didn't you say a word?" The result of reviewing these two party members: in terms of the masses, it improved the principles and consciousness of party rectification, and understood that the party is truly good, and the standard for party members is high, and rectifying party members is precisely to protect the party, correcting the illusion of a few people that "good people are not in the party, and there are no good people in the party." In terms of party members, it caused a huge fluctuation. Those with big mistakes became more humble in reflecting due to seeing the power of the masses, and party members who thought they were "clear in their hearts" and did not have major faults also discovered that they had problems in their thinking, and the internal struggle of the party was fiercely launched. On this basis, the reflection and discussion of village chief Li Wenxiang became a springboard for the climax of the movement. At that time, everyone who had opinions or grievances against him was mobilized to come to the branch meeting to vent their feelings, and more than 20 impartial people who had no vested interests were elected by the masses to participate in the evaluation. The attitude of these people was: "People have not hung me up, nor have they beaten me, but I am unhappy when I see bad things." "If he is 70% wrong, we will not say he is 80%, nor will we deduct 1%." This party rectification meeting was jointly composed of mass representatives and comrades from the work team as the presidium. The mass representatives served as the chairman, presided over the meeting, and strictly stipulated the democratic order: no beating, no hanging, no scolding, no deduction, no random root-tracing, no forced confession, and allowing defense and testimony. The mistake of Li Wenxiang, the village chief from a poor peasant background, was mainly following the bad cadres and unconsciously acting as a tail. He said: "When people were beaten, I was not the mastermind, nor did I retaliate, but I was watching from the side, and I had the 'beating people thinking'." He reflected on 40 mistakes, all of which were relatively specific, practical, and critical. Speaking of the end, he said: "I am a poor peasant. In the past, I went down the kiln with poor brothers. Now, as a party member and cadre, I turn around and oppress my own people," and then he cried bitterly. After the talk, party members launched mutual criticism, which was very sharp and detailed, giving a good impression to the masses, proving that it was still a fighting branch. At this time, the anger of those who had opinions had been reduced by more than half. They said, "You young people have soft ears and only listen to bad people. You are a village chief but you don't take charge." Then they stated their grievances. Most of them involved the problems of several major bad party members. Impartial people finally stood up to evaluate, and the presidium determined: "Li Wenxiang's reflection is better, but it cannot be passed. His problems will be dealt with after the affairs of several bad party members are clarified." After the meeting, the masses believed that "the party is truly handing over the responsibility of transforming party members to itself," and therefore they were extremely cautious. They said: "Li Wenxiang's reflection is good, we can't wrong him," and at the same time their target has turned to several major bad party members.
　　　　Remove the Special Agent Hats, the Masses' Emotions Are High
　　The two-day party rectification meeting starting on the 15th was a climax of the party rectification democratic movement in Sanwang Village. The center of the meeting was to solve the five major "special agent" cases that the people of Sanwang Village were most concerned about, namely: the Wang Rulin case, the cutting seedlings case, the stealing cloth case, the killing of poor peasant Sun Shiwu case, and the throwing grenade case. The whole case involved more than 80 people and was the biggest knot in the party-masses relationship in Sanwang Village. Before the meeting, in-depth mobilization was carried out inside and outside the party, "We must not let go of a real special agent, and we must not wrong a good person." In particular, party members were educated to adhere to principles even more, and party members were in a good mood. Everyone said: "This way we can distinguish between good and bad people." The meeting was convened on the 15th, still presided over by the presidium elected in the previous two days. The cases were divided into five groups, and the parties and witnesses were gathered in a room to make preliminary review. The review method was that whoever had not participated in standing in line was divided into a class again, and then the truth or falsehood of the case was distinguished to see if the class status of counter-revolutionaries or saboteurs could be established. Those who had been divided into classes only distinguished the case. After the review, they were sent to another room, where the presidium and representatives were in charge, for formal debate, and crowds of men, women, and children came to listen. The first case was Wang Rulin, Wang Shutang, and Li Peide. The origin was implicated from Yetao Village. Although they did not have obvious counter-revolutionary behavior in the village, the evidence from other villages could not be obtained for a while, and the result of the debate was to continue the review. The second case was Sun Tongzhu and others. Sun Tongzhu was a militia member. When he set off for Anyang to participate in the rotation war, he fired a grenade for no reason, and fired a shot at Shilitian for no reason. Li Xinggui, the former director of the armed committee, said that he destroyed weapons and was a special agent, tied him up and beat him several times, forcing him to bite out many people, and others bit out some more. Some were named and asked to bite, and some were bitten out randomly, implicating more than 20 people. At the beginning of the debate, Sun Tongzhu was very scared, saying that he accidentally dropped the gun and it misfired. Others said: "This gun is still there, and it is not slippery, how could it misfire?" Party members said: "It is wrong to waste bullets by shooting randomly when you are a militia member, we have all done it, but you can't say that this is a special agent. Ask Li Xinggui what evidence he has." After chasing and chasing, Li Xinggui had to admit that he had a grudge against Wang Yukui and wanted to frame him, but he couldn't find his fault, so he took the opportunity to bend Sun Tongzhu to bite him, and the purpose was to target Wang Yukui. The special agent thing was completely fabricated by himself. After the case was clarified, these more than 20 special agent hats were all removed. The third case was Wang Chengzhu and other 13 people, which was also added to people by Li Xinggui for personal hatred. At the beginning, during the face-washing and blackening period, Wang Chengzhu made a suggestion to him, saying that he bought a house at a low price (the fruits of struggle), so he held a grudge in his heart and said that Chengzhu stole two bundles of public cloth from the village, tied him up and beat him several times. He could not bear the torture, and under the instruction and naming of Li Xinggui and other cadres, he bit out 13 people who they all hated. Although this matter does not belong to the scope of "special agents," after the matter was clarified, the charge of stealing cloth was also removed. The fourth case was an anti-traitor campaign in 1942. Due to the immaturity of the cadres and the weakness of the leadership, they pointed to whoever was "backward" as a special agent, opened a list of more than 40 people, and passed it to the village office and asked them to form a group of six people and elect a group leader to be the "special agent leader," and each person wrote a confession. Although there was no hanging or beating at that time, the special agent hat has been worn until today, and it was washed away after clarification. The fifth case was the cutting seedlings case. Because the village office detained a Wang Yukui who ran away, this person was detained in Li Sankuan's yard, and the lock on the door was the same as Li Xingkuan's, and the cadres suspected that they let him run away, so they detained them. Yang Zhanyun, the deputy secretary of the branch, had a grudge against Li Miangui, so he named them to bite Li Miangui. Coincidentally, a few days ago, someone had cut the green seedlings in the field, so this matter was also involved in the cutting seedlings. After the clarification, the charges were also removed. On the 16th, a complaint was accepted from retired soldier Sun Shiliang, because his brother (a poor peasant) Sun Shiwu was executed by the village with the charge of being a special agent. The death sentence was approved by the county government, and the village did not have sufficient evidence, and the case could not be clarified for a while. However, Sun Shiliang is a poor peasant and a retired soldier, and his civil rights cannot be revoked because of his brother's affairs, so his civil rights were restored first. The confessions they had written were all burned in public on the 18th when the peasant association was established.
　　The review of all the above-mentioned events completely ran through the spirit of investigating facts, clarifying responsibilities, and distinguishing the truth from falsehood. The masses called it a "true struggle meeting." Once the truth was clarified, the masses clearly understood who was good and bad among the party members, who was the mastermind, and who was an accomplice, and the view that the branch was a swarm of bees immediately disappeared. On the party member side, those who had no mistakes or had small mistakes and were understood by the masses were all lively and happy because the merits and demerits were clearly distinguished.
　　With the development of the movement, the relationship between the party and the masses quickly improved within two days, and people who had a strong dissatisfaction with the party before also changed. Before they went to the meeting, they were still full of dissatisfaction. When others recommended a party member as a candidate for the peasant association committee member, they still said nothing. When the meeting was over in the evening, they said with joy, "I won't 'bock' anymore (referring to being awkward), and there will be no more conflicts." Many people had a wait-and-see attitude before the meeting. They said, "Landlords can't say anything without beating or hanging, how can this work?" Now they have also changed their tone and said, "Chairman Mao's method is good, I am convinced." The masses generally said: "The good and bad people are distinguished, and we will dare to be the masters of the house in the future, and there will be a clear sky above our heads." "Not for the village, not for the land, and not asking him to pay for his life; as long as the black and white are clear, we will be energetic in production."
　　　　Establish a New Peasant Association, Re-elect the Village Government
　　The third stage is to grasp the climax of this democratic movement and quickly expand the results, using their specific facts of being oppressed to show that only by standing up and taking charge can the gains be consolidated. Poor peasants and new middle peasants are particularly active. They unite with old middle peasants and everyone participates in the peasant association together. Before joining the association, they conduct mutual criticism and self-criticism. After joining the association, they immediately repeatedly discuss and deliberate on how to be the masters of the house? They found out the candidates unanimously supported by each group, formally established the peasant association, and the poor peasant party member Xing Zhengguo was elected as the chairman of the peasant association, including the peasant association with poor peasant groups, which for the first time became the highest power organ of the peasants in Sanwang Village. On the same day, twelve party members, including Li Binglan, Li Kuiyu, and Li Wenxiang, were reviewed. They generally said their mistakes, but they were not thorough enough, so the masses asked them to return to the mass ranks for continued review. On the 19th, the peasant association led the re-election of the village government, established the village political committee, handled the takeover, re-divided the class status, and immediately began to fill in the work. In terms of party rectification, the masses' principles were greatly improved. They listened patiently to Li Xinggui's long reflection report. Everyone said: "This reflection is frank, but for people like you, it is not enough to just listen to the words. You are like a stinky pit, and the stench cannot be released all at once. Don't put the lid on, we will clean it up for you after your stench is gone." At a heart-to-heart evening party, everyone compared the past with the present. Some said: "If the people are not in charge, even good cadres will become bad. Li Wenxiang has a good ingredient, look at the end he has come to!" "People say that I eat and drink too much, and there is no tomorrow. What's the point of me saving money? Now, don't look at the meetings every day, I still have to produce for a while before dawn!" In the democratic movement, the masses understood the value of democratic rights even more, and the entire focus of work smoothly shifted to establishing a democratic system and strengthening group life. In this way, the eyes of the new cadres are on the masses, and their thinking of "no way" gradually disappeared.
　　Summarizing the above three stages of work, it can be seen that the party rectification democratic movement must start from the masses' greatest personal interests and demands. The integration of the party and outside the party is consistent, and the movement is systematically guided step by step to a climax. Then it expands to the establishment of the people's basic democratic life. This is very necessary in an old liberated area like Sanwang Village, where land distribution is relatively thorough and democracy has become the main requirement. From the leadership of the work team, the biggest shortcomings are that after the masses' vigorous actions, our ideological leadership and detailed organizational work are felt to be insufficient and not active enough. We did not do good and meticulous research work in the movement. Because the movement developed quickly, most comrades did not do enough to grasp the simple but correct thoughts of the masses, which were changing rapidly, and improve them to specific class education and policy education. Some comrades are also satisfied with the joy and praise of the masses, and do not calmly guide the mass movement to go deeper, and also do not do enough to calm the masses down ideologically and take on more arduous responsibilities.
　　Now, this village has begun in-depth consolidation work, and the work has shifted to filling in the gaps. This basically needs to be started from improving the poor peasant groups and peasant groups, and truly establishing a new democratic system and style. In terms of party rectification, it is to start establishing a new branch, deal with all outstanding issues, and prepare to end party rectification at the same time after the filling in is completed.

### 三王村抓住群众迫切要求　整党民主形成高潮

　　三王村抓住群众迫切要求
  　整党民主形成高潮
    【本报消息】三王村是武安九区模范村，根据这次划阶级的结果：在一百六十八户中（被斗户不在内）中农占全户数百分之八十，其中以新中农占优势，贫雇农不及总户数百分之十五，封建早已消灭，地主富农已改变成份，土地基本填平，每人平均亩数约三亩，平均产量两石八斗。这一简单轮廓大体符合于中央老区、半老区工作指示所提的第一类村。
             坏党员结成小宗派为非作歹压制群众
    该村农民最迫切的要求是民主。几年来，他们被支部几个主要的坏党员压迫得喘不出气，单是为了报复诬陷他人而戴上的特务帽子就有八十顶之多（有人连戴几次），被吊打过的有四十人，全村人人自危，彼此不敢相互交谈，要求搬家的有七八户。老中农极度恐慌，他们之中被错斗了的就有二十余户，没斗的也害怕不知道在哪一天会斗到自己头上。新中农认为自己翻身得的果实不保险，说不定哪一天被人戴上特务帽子又拿走，贫雇是被干部认为“落后”“没出息”的人，他们一发牢骚，便被指为特务说破坏话。在这样恐怖的少数人专权下发展了一个街宗派关系：前街干部多、党员多。后街仅有两个党员（他们被坏党员排斥着），现在没有一个当权干部，绝大多数人被戴上了“特务”帽。后街群众不少人把少数坏干部统治看作是前街压迫后街，少数坏干部也利用这种群众盲目情绪来制造对立，缓和群众情绪，转移目标。其实这一切错误的根子都是支部里几个反人民的小宗派：其中有以李兴贵（李现在武安永茂昌工作，前为村武委会主任）为首的兄弟党（兄弟三人系党员为非作歹），有以支部书记杨守安为首的本家党（本家兄弟均系党员）。这些小宗派以李兴贵、杨守安为首四面八方地压制了群众。
    三王村工作组，在赵庄取得必需根据群众要求来进行工作的经验，到村后了解该村这一基本情况，确定工作的入手处是满足人民民主要求，关键则在于实行公开的群众性的整党。十天来三王村形成了一次整党民主运动的高潮，初步发动了群众。
            公开党员接受审查划清阶级农民当家
    从运动表现来看，大体是三个阶段：第一阶段是从思想上组织上给运动做系统的准备工作：这里包括有：公开全部党员，区分委书记区长均做了自我检讨，打破洗脸擦黑以后群众的“怕报复”思想，工作组强调指出：三王村党的支部，要接受三王村人民的监督，二十五个党员，要经群众审查，对有错误的，予以纠正错误改过自新的机会。其次是划阶级，这同样是结合民主要求的。当时提出：“划好阶级找到位置站队当家”，对中农是宣传毛主席巩固团结中农五项具体政策，打破“怕斗思想”，对贫雇及新中农强调他们是领导骨干。群众情绪极高。他们说：“过去谁知道谁是啥阶级，干部说啥就是啥”，“谁要有一点法儿，就是地主”。划阶级使全体农民取得了当家的合法权力，每当一个农民自报公议阶级成份后，工作员便拿起划阶级标准向大家宣读，说明只依据每个人对于生产资料占有和生产关系来评定阶级成份，不能有其他任何标准，立刻便起来一阵愉快的笑声。他们说：“这个办法真细”。一个老中农说：“这是毛主席‘全方面的’给老百姓找光明大道。”也正由于划阶级结合了群众民主当家的要求，大家都表现得异常严肃，不劳动专吃斗争饭的人是被检举出来了。自报不实际的被纠正了。某些群众中的“内情”（如一户吃数户的绝户地或代耕地等）也被揭穿了。经过一场划阶级初步整顿了群众队伍，群众有了组织起来的进一步要求，于是依据划阶级后的阵营，向群众提出了一个政治标准，即：长年劳动，为人正派，大公无私，热心给群众办事，进行分组讨论，从贫雇到老中农都作了一次审查，群众称之为“澄底”。澄出了将近二十名合乎四个标准的农民，其中贫农新中农占最多数。此外，把真正劳动正派农民也澄出来了，大多数是合乎两个条件，三个条件的农民。这一次政治审查提高了农民阶级觉悟，开展了批评和自我批评，张刘堂同一个有夫之妇相好，影响农民内部团结，被人评为三个半条件，他表示决心改过。这样既使农民内部纯洁，又产生了他们衷心爱戴的领头人，这些人凡是为各组一致通过的，便成了新农会的发起人。
    经济上的查阶级，政治上的查条件给全体农民民主当家作了充分的准备，奠定了以后工作发展的顺利基础。
    　　　　群众眼睛雪亮　党员好坏分明
            严格规定民主秩序不吊不打不乱追根
    第二阶段是由小到大的形成运动，在审查通过发起人的全体大会上，审查了两个党员：一个为群众拥戴的党员邢正国被顺利的通过了，让他给群众站在一起整那些坏的，但群众仍然对他保持着严格的批评，说他“是个好人，但不够一个好党员”，“你在党内斗争不强，就是为人民服务精神不够”。鼓励他提高斗争性当人民好长工。另一个是一个没有大毛病的党员王玉祯却没有被通过，群众问他：“你入党几年了？”他说是“四年。”群众说：“邢正国参加党半年，不摸底细，情有可原，你是老党员，怎么这样马虎？坏党员这样乱七八糟，你为什么一句不吭？”审查这两个党员的结果：在群众方面是提高了整党的原则性和自觉性，懂得党是真正好的，要求党员的标准是高的，整党员正是为了爱护党，纠正了少数人“好人不在党，在党没好人”的错觉。在党员方面引起巨大波动，错误大的看到群众力量更加虚心反省，自己以为“心地亮亮的”，没有大过错的党员也发现自己思想上有毛病，党内斗争激烈展开。在这样基础上，村长李文祥的反省和讨论便成了运动高潮的跳板。当时，动员一切对他有意见有冤屈的人都到支部会上来尽情发泄，又由群众选举廿余名没有切身利害关连的公正人士作为代表参加评理。这些人的态度是：“人家也没吊过我，也没打过我，可是坏事我看着就是不平”，“错了七分，咱不说他八分，也不减他一分”。这一整党会议由群众代表及工作组同志共同组成主席团，由群众代表当主席，主持会议，严格的规定了民主秩序：不打、不吊、不骂、不扣、不乱追根、不强迫坦白、允许辩护作证等。贫农出身村长李文祥的错误，主要是跟上坏干部不自觉的作了尾巴，他说：“打人时，我不是主谋，也没有报复，可是我在旁边看着，我是有‘打人思想’的”。他反省了四十条错误，都比较具体、实际，且有批判性。内容多系工作中的作风问题，谈到最后，他说：“我是贫农，过去同穷兄弟一块下窑，现在当了党员干部反过来压迫自己人”，说着便痛哭起来。谈完后，党员间相互展开批评，非常尖锐细致，给群众的印象很好，证明仍然是一个有战斗力的支部。此时有意见的人气愤已减消大半，他们说：“你这年青人耳根子软，光听坏人话，当村长不当家。”然后把自己受冤枉的经过作了陈述。其中大半是涉及了几个主要坏党员的问题。公正人士最后起来评理，由主席团确定：“李文祥反省较好，但不能通过，他的问题要留在几个坏党员事情弄清后再处理。”会后群众认为“党真是把改造党员的责任交在自己手上”，因而极其慎重。他们说：“李文祥反省的好，咱不能冤枉他”，同时他们的目标已经转到几个主要坏党员身上了。
            摘掉特务帽群众情绪高
    从十五日开始的两天整党会议是三王村整党民主运动的一个高潮，会议的中心是解决三王村人民最关心的五大“特务”案，计：王如林案，割苗案，偷布案，杀贫农孙世午案，打手榴弹案。全案牵涉八十余人，是三王村党群关系中最大的疙瘩。会前在党内外进行深入动员，“真是特务一个也不能放过，不是特务不能冤枉一个好人。”特别教育党员更要坚持原则，党员情绪很好，大家说：“这样就可以分出好坏人”。十五日召开会议，仍由前二天选出的主席团主持，按案情分作五组，先把当事人和证人集合在一个屋里，作初步审查。审查方法是凡没有参加站队的，给划一次阶级，再辨别案情真伪，看是否能确立反革命分子或破坏分子成份。划过阶级的就单辨别案情。审查后再把他们送到另一个屋里去，那里有主席团和代表在主持，作正式的辩论，男女老小群众来旁听的川流不息。第一宗案子是王如林、王树棠、李培德三人，起根是冶陶村牵连过来的，虽然他们在村里没有显然的反革命行为，但别村的证据一时无法得到，辩论结果，决定继续审查。第二宗是孙同柱等二十人。孙同柱是民兵，出发安阳轮战时，无故打过一颗手榴弹，又在什里店无故打过一响手枪，前武委会主任李兴贵便以破坏武器，说他是特务，把他捆吊起来，毒打数次迫他咬出许多人，别人又再咬出一些，有的是指名叫咬的，有的是自己乱咬的，株连二十多人。辩论开始，孙同柱起初很害怕，说他打枪是失手把枪跌落自行走火的，别人说：“这枪现在还在，并不滑机，怎么会走火？”党员们都说：“当民兵乱打枪浪费子弹是不对，我们都打过，但也不能指这件事就说是特务，问李兴贵有什么证据”。追来追去，李兴贵只得承认他和王玉奎有仇，想陷害他又找不着他的错，便借这机会屈孙同柱来咬他，目的在搞王玉奎，特务的事完全是自己无中生有。案情辨明后，这二十多顶特务帽子便都揭掉。第三宗是王成柱等十三人，也是李兴贵为了私人仇恨给人乱加的，起头是因为洗脸擦黑时候，王成柱给他提过意见，说他贱价买过一座房子（斗争果实），于是他衔恨在心，便借村里掉了两捆公家布的题目说是成柱偷的，把他吊打数次。他受刑不过，又在李兴贵和别的干部授意与指名之下，咬出他们各所痛恨的人物十三人。这事虽不属“特务”范围，但事情辨明之后，也把偷布罪名给去了。第四宗是一九四二年搞了一次反奸。由于干部的幼稚和领导的薄弱，看见谁“落后”便指谁是特务，开了四十几人的名单，传到村公所叫他们六人编一组，选个组长当“特务头”，每人写张悔过书，当时虽没有吊打，但特务帽子却一直戴到今天，辨明之后给洗刷了。第五宗是割苗案。因为村公所扣了一个王玉奎跑了，这人扣在李三宽的院里，门上的锁又和李兴宽的一样，干部怀疑他们把他放跑，即把他们扣起来。支部副书记杨占云和李勉贵有仇，就指名叫他们二人咬李勉贵，恰巧前几天有人割掉地里的青苗，于是又把这事牵扯到割苗去，辨明之后也给他们把罪名去了。十六日接受退伍军人孙世良控告状，因为他哥（贫农）孙世午身蒙特务罪名被村里处死，死刑是经县政府批准的，村里没有充分证据，案情一时不能辨白。但孙世良是贫农又是退伍军人，不能因为他哥的事也取消他的公民权，所以先给他把公民权恢复了。他们所曾写过的悔过书，统于十八日成立农会时当众烧掉。
    所有上述事件的审查，完全贯串查事实，明责任，辨真伪的精神，群众把它叫作“斗真会”。真象一辨明，群众对党员的谁好谁坏谁是主谋谁是胁从都明明白白，把支部当作一窝蜂的看法立刻风消云散。党员方面也因功过分清，没有错误和错误小的、为群众所谅解的都活泼愉快。
    随着运动的发展，两天之间，党群关系迅速改善，以前对党抱有浓厚不满情绪的人也变了。他们去参加会议以前还是一肚子不满，别人举个党员当农会委员候选人他们还说二话，到晚上开罢会便喜眉笑眼的说：“以后不‘蹩劲’了（指闹别扭），不起矛盾了”。不少人在会前是抱着观望态度的，他们说：“地主不打不吊都说不出来，这怎能行？”现在也改变了语调说：“毛主席的办法好，我算信服了。”群众普遍的说：“分清了好坏人，咱以后就敢当家作主，头上有了青天”。“不为庄子不为地，也不要他偿命；黑白只要分明，咱生产就有劲了”。
    　　　　成立新农会改选村政府
    第三阶段是把握这一民主运动高潮迅速扩大战果，以他们受压迫的具体事实说明只有起来当家才能巩固已得胜利，贫农、新中农格外活跃，他们联合老中农大家一齐参加农会，入会前进行相互批评与自我批评，入会后立即反复讨论和酝酿如何当家？找出了各组一致拥护的候选人，正式成立了农会，贫农党员邢正国被选为农会主席，包括有贫农小组的农会，第一次成为三王村农民最高权力机关。同日又审查了李炳兰、李奎玉、李文相等十二个党员，他们大体把错误也都说了，但还不十分彻底，所以群众叫他们回到群众队伍中间继续审查。十九日，农会领导改选了村政权，建立了村政委员会，办理接收，再划阶级，并立即开始着手填补工作。在整党方面群众原则性是大大提高了，他们静心地听了李兴贵长时间的反省报告，大家说：“这个反省是坦白的，可是象你这样的人，光听说话是不行的，你好比一个臭茅坑，臭气是一下子放不完的，千万不可放盖，你的臭气出完了，我们再替你打扫”。在一个谈心晚会上，每个人都把过去同现在作了对比，有的说：“老百姓不当家，好干部也要变坏，李文祥是好成份，看他落得这样下场！”“人家说我大吃二喝，有今天没明天，我省吃俭用有啥意思？现在你别看天天开会，我天不亮还要生产一小会哩！”在民主运动中群众更加懂得了民主权利之可贵，整个工作重点顺利地转入建立民主制度，加强小组生活。这样，新干部眼睛是看到群众，他们的“没办法”的思想逐渐消失了。
    概括以上三个工作阶段，可以看出整党民主运动必须从群众最大的切身利益和要求出发。党内与党外结合一致，有系统的一步一步引导运动走向高潮。然后扩展到建立人民基本的民主生活方面去，这在象三王村这样一个土地分配比较彻底、民主成了主要要求的老区，是十分必要的。从工作组领导来检查，最大的缺点是在群众轰轰烈烈行动之后，我们的思想领导和细密的组织工作均感到不够有力，不够主动；我们没有在运动中很好的做细密的研究工作。因为运动发展的快，大多数同志对于如何掌握变化异常迅速的群众朴素而正确的思想，提高到具体的阶级教育和政策的教育是做得不够的。也有的同志满足群众的喜悦和歌颂，不去冷静的引导群众运动走向深入，从思想上也让群众冷静下来，担负起更艰巨的责任，也做得十分不够。
    现在，这个村已开始了深入巩固工作，工作转入填补，这基本上要从健全贫农小组农民小组来着手进行，真正树立新的民主制度和作风。在整党方面，是着手建立新的支部，处理一切遗留问题，准备在填补完毕后同时结束整党。
