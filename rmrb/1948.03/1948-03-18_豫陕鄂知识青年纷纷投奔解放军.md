Xinhua News Agency, Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 16th: Since the Chen-Xie army crossed south, intellectuals from various areas under Chiang's control have flocked to the liberated areas to study and participate in various works. When Yuxian County was liberated, the county's secondary schools continued to operate as usual, and 20 teachers and students requested to join the People's Liberation Army. When Luohe was liberated, Cheng Baixi, the principal of Yancheng Middle School, and more than 30 teachers and students joined the work of the People's Liberation Army. After the liberation of Luonan, more than 250 intellectual youths have participated in work, one after another. Candidates for the 4th branch of the Military and Political University, the Yu-Xi Military and Political Cadre School, and the Northwest Hubei Military and Political School, all organized by the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government, are even more enthusiastic. In the Yu-Xi Military and Political Cadre School and its branches alone, the number of students admitted has reached 900, most of whom have a secondary or higher education level. Wang Zhiyu, the head of the Education Section of Jia County, had 13 family members studying at the school. Fan Jizhou, a youth from Yuxian County, saw the enrollment advertisement and immediately walked 120 miles in one day through the snow to enroll. The school's study life is now extremely active. A literary and art troupe has been established, and they rehearse dramas such as "Blood and Tears of Hatred" and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" in their spare time. Democratic governments in various places have also opened various training courses and assisted local educators in opening primary and secondary schools. Currently, there are secondary schools such as Yilu Middle School and Xiangcheng United Middle School. After students have a preliminary understanding of the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, they have successively accused the Chiang bandits of strangling culture and mistreating intellectual youths. Teachers and students of Xiangcheng United Middle School also went to various villages to publicize Chairman Mao's report on "The Current Situation and Our Tasks." Forty intellectual youths from Lushan jointly declared their withdrawal from the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League, calling on everyone to oppose Sun Yat-sen's traitorous and traitor Chiang Kai-shek.
