　　【Taihang News】The land reform work in Zhongyuan Village, She County, first went through a propaganda and preparation stage. Initially, when the Land Law was promoted to middle and poor peasants in night schools, the masses showed great concern. Some said, "Wouldn't it be great if it could be implemented like this!" Then, several of the most impoverished people in the village were visited to understand their suffering and the overall situation of the village. Having learned the lesson of "blackening faces" (suffering repercussions for speaking out) last year, the masses were afraid that their opinions would be useless and that the cadres would suffer themselves. People who had been labeled as "special agents" in the past were even more reluctant to speak out about their grievances. The work team explained the leadership's determination this time, and only then did the ideological shackles on everyone begin to loosen somewhat. Some expressed a certain degree of trust, thinking, "Maybe it will work this time!?" Wang Ting, a poor peasant who had been suppressed by cadres in the past, began to recount his suffering, saying, "If that's the case, I'll risk my life to do it this time!" After their suffering was recounted, these grievances were quickly published in the newspaper, which caused a sensation in the entire village. The newspaper carrying the complaints of Wang Ting and Yang Dayan was posted on the public blackboard, and people discussed it. Some still expressed wait-and-see skepticism. Those who complained felt isolated and demanded "gathering people" and action. At this time, the work team determined the overall work policy based on the demands of the masses and the situation in the village, announcing that except for the administrative and armed forces, which were under the leadership of the work team and continued to perform routine tasks such as dispatching errands and allocating grain, other activities would be suspended. It was also publicly announced that the poor and hired peasants would be mobilized to implement the Land Law. The old organization would be convened by the work team when meetings were needed, and the discipline of implementing the Land Law was announced to cadres and party members, emphasizing that those who had made mistakes should reflect and accept the review of the masses, while those who were good could still hold positions. In this period of in-depth visits and small-scale forums, the initial feeling was that we must first make the poor and hired peasants believe in our policies to dispel their concerns, but we must also carry out specific mobilization quickly. Due to the urgent desire of the poor and hired peasants to turn the tables, we must also pay attention to the propaganda of the policy under the situation that the holes are big and the tops are small. Do not guide the masses to "leftist" (moving middle peasants) ideas; but on the other hand, we must give the greatest sympathy to the suffering talked about by the poor and hired peasants, and express with full enthusiasm that we will work together to relieve their suffering. This specific and serious responsible attitude greatly encouraged every poor and hired peasant. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding, on the one hand, we must talk directly, and on the other hand, we must also verify from other aspects, and combine these living materials with the previously generally understood situation, because some things the poor and hired peasants do not fully understand. After this, the slogans "Organize the Poor Peasants League, unite the middle peasants to form a new farmers' association and everyone will turn over", "The poor peasants are of one mind, regardless of Hou Nao and Dong Di" (there are historical sectarian contradictions between Hou Nao and Dong Di in this village) were immediately put forward, calling on everyone to unite, eliminate sectarianism, and turn over by complaining about the suffering of feudal exploitation, the suffering of oppression by bad cadres, and the suffering of unfair burdens. Everyone felt that the suffering was connected to each other, and they were all very indignant. Some said, "I wanted to vent my anger a long time ago!" After recounting his suffering, old man Lü Pingjing said, "Although I am old, I have to get up and do it!" At the first meeting of the poor and hired peasants, the nine poor and hired peasant groups that had been actively active in the previous stage were first relied on to form a temporary poor and hired peasant group to prepare for expanding the team. When preparing to absorb members, they were very cautious, proposing to put aside those with some problems for later, and picking the good ones first. Good party members and cadres were also absorbed in a timely manner, such as Lü Pingjing (party member) and Lü Tianxi (director of the Armed Forces Committee), who had not made any major mistakes in the past and could be with the masses, were approved early. In the review of the next few people, everyone's discussion and the individual's self-criticism were combined. For example, Zhang Fucheng was the militia captain, who had no father since he was a child, his family was poor and lived as a long-term worker, and he was very active in the struggle after he settled in Zhongyuan. At first, some people said that he was hugging the cadres' thighs! After everyone's analysis, it was considered that he was running around the outer circle of the cadres, and he was not in the old gang, and his interests could stand with everyone, so it was decided to absorb him into the group. This process of review, discussion and approval is in fact a process of raising everyone's class consciousness. The atmosphere was tense and enthusiastic during the review, so that everyone knew that they had to maintain their purity after joining the group. On the other hand, let go of democracy and pay attention not to form a closed door. After more than ten days of stringing together and reviewing, there were more than 40 male and female poor and hired peasants. Immediately, the establishment of the Poor Peasants League was brewed, and the three conditions for the members of the Poor Peasants Committee were discussed: 1. The position is correct and the struggle is resolute; 2. Do not be selfish and fair in handling affairs; 3. Enthusiastic and responsible with a democratic style. On February 23, the official founding meeting of the Poor Peasants League was held. Immediately, someone proposed: "In the past, it was not democratic. One person raised his fist, and everyone went along with the pole. This time, we have to change it." They also disapproved of throwing beans, fearing that "the beans would slip down the furrow," and those sitting in front would lose more. Everyone agreed that this election should be cautious, with equal rights for men and women, and whoever wanted to be elected would be elected. Then, the groups were separated to prepare and nominate candidates. As everyone went through the comparison and selection, there was no restraint in the proposals. Not only did they say how good he was and that he met the conditions, but they also criticized his shortcomings, pointing out that they were problems that needed to be corrected. For example, for the first candidate, Sun Yurong, everyone said: "The line is correct, and he has not been at odds with the landlords since he was a child; moreover, he does not have independent opinions, and he is frank about his own big and small shortcomings, and he has a very democratic style and can do things for everyone." As for his shortcomings, everyone mentioned more that he was a little violent. Some said: "But this is a skin disease, and it can be cured if he is willing to treat it." During the official election, it was decided to vote by secret ballot. As a result, Yang Shijie, Sun Yurong, Lü Chenggun and other seven people got the most votes. The election results showed two characteristics: the truly honest and enthusiastic people were elected, and those who were selfish and wanted to be cadres were not elected. In addition, everyone showed special love and respect for the newly elected members. As the new members gave speeches to everyone, Lü Chenggun stretched out his hand and vividly compared: "Everyone elected me as a member, and I will definitely do things well. The previous cadres were like this (stretched out his thumb), pressing on everyone, and we are now like this (stretched out his little finger), acting as shopkeepers for everyone. Everyone helps me, and I will do things well for everyone." Finally, he especially hoped that everyone would give more opinions to the new members in the future so that they could improve their work at any time. After the meeting, someone reflected: "The election has never been so good as this time. This time the election was very democratic, and the good ones were elected. It was really touching!"

　　表明态度发动贫雇
  　中原村成立贫农团
    【太行消息】涉县中原村的土改工作，首先经过一个宣传酝酿阶段。开初，在夜校向中贫农宣传土地法中，群众表现了非常的关切，有的说：“能照这实行了该不是好哩！”接着便在村内访了几个最苦的人，了解他们的痛苦和全村情形。群众有去年洗脸擦黑的教训，都怕提了意见不顶事，惹下干部自己吃苦。以前被“特务”帽子盖过的人更是表现了想谈不敢谈的苦闷。工作组向大家说明这次领导上的决心，这样大家思想上的束缚才开始解开些，有的就表示了一定程度的信任，认为：“也许这次能行！？”以前受干部压制的贫农王亭便诉开自己的苦，并说：“既是这样，这次拼着死也得干干哩！”他们的苦诉出后，便将这些冤苦很快在报上发表了，这一来，全村轰动了，载有王亭和杨大眼诉苦的报贴在大众黑板上，人们议论纷纷。有的仍表现观望怀疑，诉苦的人，感到势孤，要求“聚人”，要求行动。这时工作组就根据群众要求和村中情况确定了整个工作方针，宣布除政权武装受工作组领导继续执行派差拨粮等日常事务性的工作外，其他暂停活动，并公开宣布要发动贫雇，执行土地法，旧组织需开会时由工作组召集，并向干部党员宣布了执行土地法的纪律，着重说明有错误的要反省接受群众审查，好的还可以担任工作。在这段的深入访问和小型座谈当中，初步感到的就是：着手就必须让贫雇对我们的政策相信，以解除他们的顾虑，但也必须很快进行具体发动，由于贫雇要求翻身的迫切，在窟窿大补顶小的情况下，对政策的宣传也须注意，不要引导群众到“左倾”（动中农）的思想上；但另一方面对贫雇所谈的苦，更必须予以最大的同情，并以满腔热忱表示要为解除其痛苦来共同干，这种具体严肃的负责态度，对每个贫雇鼓舞很大。在求得对全面了解上，一方面是直接谈，一方面也必须从其他方面来印证，并依据这些活的材料与以前一般了解的情况配合起来，因为有些东西贫雇是不完全了解的。经过这样当即提出“组织贫农团、联合中农成立新农会大家翻身”，“贫农是一心不分后垴和东底”（该村后垴和东底有历史性的宗派矛盾）等口号，号召大家团结起来，消除宗派，诉苦翻身。大家从诉封建剥削苦、坏干部压迫苦、支差负担不公苦上，感到苦苦相连，彼此都很愤慨，有的就说：“我早想把自己的气出一出哩！”吕平静老汉在诉了自己苦后说：“我虽老了，也非起来干不行！”在贫雇第一次会上，首先依托前段积极活动的九个贫雇农组成了临时贫雇小组，酝酿扩大队伍。在酝酿吸收团员时，都很慎重，对有点毛病的提出暂放后点，先拣好的挑，党员和干部中好的，大家也及时的吸收了进来，如吕平静（党员）和吕天喜（武委会主任）以前没有大错误，能和群众一道，便早被批准了。在审查以后的几个人中，大家的讨论和本人的检讨配合着，如张福成是民兵队长，从小没爹，家穷住长工，后来安家到中原，斗争中很积极，一开始有人说他抱着干部大腿哩！后经大家分解，认为他在干部里是跑的个外圈子，还不是那老一伙里的，利益上能和大家站在一起，决定把他吸收入团。这种审查讨论和批准的过程，事实上就是一个提高大家阶级觉悟的过程，审查时空气紧张热烈，使每个人入团后也知道要保持自己的纯洁。另一方面放手民主，注意不要形成关门。经过十多天的串连审查，男女贫雇已有四十多人，当即酝酿成立贫农团，讨论了贫农委员的三个条件是：一、立场正斗争坚决；二、不自私自利办事公道；三、热心负责有民主作风。二月二十三号，贫农团便举行正式成立大会，当即有人提出：“过去那不民主，一人举拳头，大家顺杆上，这次要改一改。”对丢豆也不赞成，怕“顺犁沟溜豆”，坐在前边的丢的多。大家意见这次选举要慎重，男女平等，谁想选举谁就选谁。接着分开组先酝酿提候选人，随着大家便进行比选。由于民主的发扬，毫无拘束，提出的人不只说他那点好，合于条件，也批判他的缺点，指出那是毛病要改正。如对第一个候选人孙裕荣，大家说：“路线走的对，从小就和老财不一气；再是不独主意见，自己大缺点小缺点都坦白，很有民主作风，能为大家办事。”对他的缺点大家提的多是说他性暴些，有的又说：“不过这是皮外病，肯治就能好。”正式选举时，决定不记名票选。结果杨世杰、孙裕荣、吕成群等七人票最多。选举结果表现了两个特点：真正老实热心的人是当选了，有私心想当干部的反而没选上。另外，大家对新选出来的委员表现出特别的爱护尊重。随着新委员给大家讲话，吕成群伸出手生动的比喻着：“大家选我当委员，咱一定把事办好，以前的干部是这（伸出大姆指）压在大家上边的，咱们现在是这（伸出小指），给大家当伙计的，大家帮助我，我好好给大家办。”最后他特别希望大家以后要对新委员多提意见，以便随时改进工作。会后有人就反映：“从来选举没有这次好，这次选的可民主，好的都选上了，真碰心！”
