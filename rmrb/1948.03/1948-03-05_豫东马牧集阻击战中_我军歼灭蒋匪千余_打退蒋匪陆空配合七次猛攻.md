  　Repelled Seven Fierce Attacks by Chiang Kai-shek Bandits in Coordination with Air and Land Forces
    [Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Front, 3rd dispatch] Belated news: In the blockade battle at Mamuji (east of Shangqiu) on February 20th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army killed and captured over 1,300 Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers and destroyed three tanks. On that day, Chiang Kai-shek's 75th Division, the 147th Brigade of the 88th Division, and a rapid column attacked from the north, northeast, and northwest in three routes, and coordinated their operations with eight tanks, over forty armored vehicles, and four airplanes. The People's Liberation Army fought bravely in the area of Niu Wang*, Cao Wa, and Lü Zhuang, twenty miles southeast of Mamuji, and repelled seven fierce enemy attacks from 10:00 AM to dusk. The People's Liberation Army positions remained firmly in place.
    [Xinhua News Agency, E Yu Wan Front, 3rd dispatch] On the 10th of last month, the militia of Deng County in southwestern Henan launched a night attack on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit stronghold in Shanbaichong Village. After a brief battle, all the local Chiang Kai-shek bandits were annihilated, with over twenty people and guns captured. The militia suffered no casualties. The Democratic County Government of the county issued a commendation order.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yu Shan E Front, 3rd dispatch] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has launched a mass-based training upsurge. Each company goes to the field to practice movements as soon as it dawns. A certain company has invented a method for aiming at night. Another unit practiced assault, launched a brainstorming campaign to find solutions, and created models to study how to erect springboards. As a result, each company was able to cross the outer trench and climb onto the city wall from sixty meters away in just a few minutes. In addition, cooks, barbers, and other personnel are enthusiastically studying techniques. For example, in the past, it took one and a half hours to build a stove in a certain kitchen. After repeated research and improvement, it can now be built in five minutes. In another unit's kitchen, it used to take four hours to make steamed buns for over 130 people, but now it only takes one and a half hours.

  　我军歼灭蒋匪千余
  　打退蒋匪陆空配合七次猛攻
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线三日电】迟到消息：解放军某部于二月二十日在马牧集（商邱东）阻击战中毙俘蒋匪军一千三百余名并击毁坦克三辆。是日蒋匪整七五师及整八八师之一四七旅及一个快速纵队由北、东北、西北分三路南犯，并以八辆坦克四十余辆装甲车、四架飞机配合作战。解放军在马牧集东南二十里之牛王＠、曹洼、吕庄一线奋勇阻击，自上午十时激战到黄昏，打退敌七次猛攻，解放军阵地屹然未动。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线三日电】上月十日豫西南邓县民兵，夜袭山柏冲村蒋匪据点，经短促战斗，将土蒋匪全部歼灭，俘人枪二十余，民兵无伤亡，该县民主县政府特予通令嘉奖。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线三日电】解放军某部掀起群众性的练兵热潮。各连队天刚明就到野外练习动作。某连发明了一种夜间瞄准的办法。另部演习攻坚，展开想办法运动，作模型研究架跳板方法，结果每个连队只用数分钟即从六十米外通过外壕爬上城头。此外炊事员、理发员等均热心研究技术，如某伙房过去建一个灶需要一点半钟，经再三研究改进，五分钟就可以建起。另一单位伙房作一百三十多人吃的馒头，过去需时四个钟头，现在只要一点半钟。
