Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Comprehensive news from Chiang Kai-shek controlled newspapers: The people in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of Shaanxi Province are living in extreme suffering under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In Liquan County, with a population of less than 110,000, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits plundered 140,000 dan of grain in the first ten months of last year alone under the guise of "actual levy," "requisition," and "military purchase." This was in a county with "reduced levies"; other counties bore even heavier burdens. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits also invented the pretext of "allocation of burden" to force people to pay for buying conscripts. Currently, each conscript costs 30 million Chiang Kai-shek currency. Last year, the county drafted soldiers three times, burdening the people with tens of billions. In Fengxiang County, the grain collection was extremely urgent. Chiang Kai-shek committee members, police, and local militia went to the countryside armed with rulers more than two feet long or with guns. Whenever they arrived at a village, they first surrounded it and then went from house to house, whipping and coercing the peasants. Once, in a certain village, the peasants fled upon hearing the news. These bandits tied up more than fifty old men, women, and children who could not escape to trees and beat them with rulers in turn. They also shot and killed an old woman who could not afford to pay the grain, forcing the peasants to sell their farm tools and furniture at a discount to pay for the grain. In a village with twenty-five households in Changning Town, Yongshou County, two-thirds of the people were forced to flee their homes due to the grain collection. In the Guanzhong area, the common tax items include identity card fees, stove fees, birth registration fees, salaries for township and village personnel, "militia" rations, and gun fees, totaling more than twenty types. A small village with more than ten households in Changning Town, Yongshou, paid 2.208 million Chiang Kai-shek currency in one month last August. In a village in Qian’dong Township, Liquan, with seventy households, sixty-four households had to borrow money at high interest rates in the first half of last year because they could not afford the payments. The grain harvested in the summer was seized by the grain collectors while it was still in the fields.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Comprehensive news from Chiang Kai-shek controlled newspapers: The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have recently been heavily extorting merchants in Henan and Hubei provinces. Last December, the Chiang Kai-shek Henan Provincial Government, based on the so-called "Outline for Implementing Suppression of Rebellion and Banditry" of the Chiang Kai-shek central authorities, formulated the "Measures for Donations from Wealthy Merchants in Yin and Shang," deciding to levy 260 billion Chiang Kai-shek currency from merchants in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of the province this year, with the distribution ratio being 70% for major cities and 30% for counties. The first phase of forced collection in the first half of this year is 130 billion Chiang Kai-shek currency, of which Kaifeng and Zhengzhou account for 60 billion Chiang Kai-shek currency, and the remainder is shared by 38 counties. However, 29 of these counties have been liberated by the People's Liberation Army, and the other nine counties have become ghost towns. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits recently established the "Wuhan Garrison Headquarters," which requires 1.87 billion Chiang Kai-shek currency per month and has decided to plunder Wuhan merchants to fill it. They have stipulated four grades of monthly donations: 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency, forcing merchants to pay the full amount. At the same time, they have also levied huge sums to build defense works in the suburbs of Wuhan. After the military police frantically pursued and collected the funds without success, the Garrison Headquarters published an "Open Letter to the Compatriots of the Three Towns of Wuhan" on November 8th, demanding that "all households undertaking construction funds must pay in full within the time limit," and those who are "stingy and sluggish" will be "severely punished for obstructing mobilization." However, very few merchants have paid.

　　陕西蒋匪催粮急
  　逼着农民卖农具
    【新华社四日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：陕西蒋区人民在蒋匪统治下生活极端痛苦。该省醴泉县人口不到十一万，去年前十个月内，蒋匪用“征实”、“征借”、“军购”等名目掠夺的粮食即达十四万担。这还是“减半征收”的县份，其他县份负担更多。蒋匪又巧立“配负”名目，逼迫人民出钱买壮丁，目前每名要三千万蒋币，去年该县抽丁三次，全县人民负担以百亿计。凤翔县催粮甚急，蒋匪委员和警察、保丁下乡都手执二尺多长的戒尺，或荷枪实弹，每到一村先团团包围，再挨户鞭打催逼，一次某村农民闻风逃散，这些匪徒就把跑不动的老汉、妇女、娃娃五十余人一齐捆在树上，用戒尺挨次毒打，且枪杀一个出不起粮的老婆婆，逼着农民把农具和家具折价交粮。永寿县属常宁镇五保某村二十五户人家，被追粮逼迫逃离乡井的人达三分之二。大关中各县常见的捐税名目有所谓身份证费、灶具费、生育登记费、乡保人员给养费、薪水费、“民兵”给养费、枪械费等二十多种，永寿常宁镇一个十多户的小村去年八月一个月就出了二百二十万零八千蒋币；醴泉阡东乡某村有七十户，去年上半年因出不起款子而借高利的就有六十四户。各家夏收的粮食还在场上就被征粮的抢走了。
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合蒋区报纸消息蒋匪近在豫鄂两省大肆苛索商民。蒋匪河南省政府去年十二月根据蒋匪中央的所谓“戡乱剿匪实施纲要”，制定“殷商富户捐款办法”，决定在今年一年内向该省蒋匪统治区商民勒征蒋币二千六百亿元，分配比例为各大城市负担百分之七十，各县负担百分之三十。今年上半年为第一期强征一千三百亿元，其中开封、郑州两市占六百亿元，余由三十八个县分担，但其中二十九县被人民解放军解放，其他九县也成死城。蒋匪最近成立“武汉警备部”，月需蒋币十八亿七千万元，决定向武汉商民搜刮充用，规定一万、二万、五万、十万四等，强迫商民如数缴纳月捐。同时并勒派巨款，修筑武汉近郊防御工事，经宪警疯狂追收无效，该匪警备部十一月八日又发表“告武汉三镇同胞书”，要“所有承担工款各户，限期一律交清”，如“悭吝疲滞”即按“妨害动员重治”。但商民缴纳者仍极寥寥。
