　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. London dispatch: Francisco Anco, representative of the Spanish Communist Party, and Misan, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party and member of the French National Assembly, were warmly welcomed by the delegates at the 20th National Congress of the British Communist Party. Misan delivered a brief speech at the conference on the 22nd, in which he drew everyone's attention to the fact that Bevin and Bidault are running ahead of their American masters, anxiously placing Britain and France at the forefront of the Western bloc, which is the advanced outpost for anti-Soviet and anti-new democratic countries. He said: The purpose of the Marshall Plan is to make it easier for American capital to invest in Britain, France, and other countries, and to make these countries more docilely obey American capitalism.
　　Rust, editor-in-chief of the Workers' Daily, especially exposed the war aims of American imperialism with the help of the Labour Party at the conference that day. When it was said that Churchill was a blood-drinking old adventurer and Britain's number one warmonger, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause. Rust pointed out that the Marshall Plan is a war plan, the basis of which is to establish a West German state with the Ruhr as its arsenal.

    【新华社陕北二十八日电】伦敦讯：在英共第二十届全代大会上，西班牙共产党代表福兰西斯哥·安郭和法共政治局委员、法国民议会议员米桑二人，得到大会代表们的热烈欢迎。米桑在二十二日大会上曾发表简短演说，其中提请大家注意：贝文、比道尔正跑在他们美国主子的前面，焦急地要把英法两国放在西方集团的前列，而这一集团则是反苏与反新民主主义各国的前进哨岗。他说：马歇尔计划的目的在于使美国资本便于在英法和其他国家内投资，使这些国家更加驯服地听从美国资本主义。
    工人日报总编辑鲁斯特在当天大会上，曾特别揭发在工党帮助下，美国帝国主义的作战目的。当说到邱吉尔是喝血的老冒险家和英国第一号战争贩子时，全场掌声雷动。鲁氏指出马歇尔计划是一个战争计划，其基础是建立起西德国家，以鲁尔为其兵工厂。
