(Shahe News) After eleven days of exploration, the work team arriving at New City Township has the following points to offer for research and reference in various regions:

　　After the work team arrived in the village, they immediately delved into the masses to find poor and hired laborers. After four or five days, they found fourteen long-term laborers who had not yet completely turned themselves around, with the aim of using these few poor and hired laborers to mobilize the entire village. However, these fourteen people were very unenthusiastic. No matter how many times the leadership explained things, they remained hesitant. Two of them, who had relatively high yields, even wanted to quit. At this point, the leadership was most distressed, unsure of how to proceed. Later, the work team comrades further delved into the poor and hired laborers, listened to the reflections of the masses, and conducted research to find the root cause of the village's lack of enthusiasm: First, during these days, the village cadres were antagonistic towards the poor and hired laborers, using production as an excuse to hold large meetings continuously, preventing the poor and hired laborers from holding small meetings. Han Maodeng said, "We dare not go to the poor and hired laborers' meetings; if we don't participate in the large meetings, the village cadres won't allow it." The masses were afraid of causing trouble, fearing retaliation from the village cadres after the work team left, so they dared not approach us. Second, the leadership did not express its own attitude, and the poor and hired laborers could not figure out what these people were here to do. Most of the masses said, "As long as the work team comes to divide the land for us, that's enough." Some said, "These cadres are very different from before; they don't look for the village cadres, but delve into the masses. What are they investigating? We must be careful about what we say." In particular, without expressing an attitude towards the Party members and cadres in the branch, the masses dared not do anything even more. After researching the above problems, based on the specific situation and the ideological concerns of the masses, a mass meeting was convened to suspend all the work of the cadres and Party members in office for self-reflection and examination. At the same time, it was explained that this time, the poor and hired laborers would be relied upon, and the middle peasants would be united to consolidate, fill, and examine our Party members…. With this, the masses were less worried. They began to raise opinions and pour out their grievances. Some cried out loud when talking about the oppression they suffered from the cadres. Zhou Ming, a poor peasant woman, said, "This time, I will risk my life to pour out my grievances. Last year, I went to Beizhang Village to attend a poor and hired laborers' meeting and raised a few opinions about the village cadres. They found out and remembered me, seeking revenge. Once, I spoke a few words to the former women's chairman, and the village cadres said I was a spy and spreading rumors, severely beat me, and even prepared to deduct forty days from me." The masses' emotions were high, and they automatically gathered again after lunch. This method of combining individual connections with public propaganda to express attitudes had a great effect.

　　After hearing the outpouring of grievances from individual connections to the general assembly, the leadership was very happy to see that the masses were energized. What should be done next? They had no idea again and became depressed. Later, they found six reliable poor and hired laborers, such as Han Maodeng and Xing Quancheng, and relied on them to connect forty poor and hired laborers to study how to rectify the ranks. Liu Zhufu said, "Not all the old cadres are bad; there are good ones too. Suspending all work is right, but we must first rectify ourselves. Like building a house, if the foundation is not well laid, it won't work…" Thus, criticism and self-criticism were launched among the poor and hired laborers. Then, a preliminary study of composition was conducted, clarifying the class features within the poor and hired laborers on the one hand, and studying the standards and methods of classifying composition on the other. At the same time, the branch also began to rectify the Party ranks, with criticism and self-criticism. Some poor and hired Party members have already reflected on many problems. The work comrades happily said, "Asking the masses is the way to find a solution." Since then, the New City Village has broken through the stagnant situation. Soon, a farmers' association (or poor peasant group, to be decided by the masses) will be formally established, Party members will be made public, and poor and hired laborers' representatives will be invited to participate in branch meetings to examine Party members, determine the composition of the entire village, and conduct supplementary work.

　　It is good that the work team can change its working methods and determine its working steps in a timely manner according to the requirements of the masses, but the leadership should have a general direction and plan in order to correctly guide the masses forward and reduce confusion and detours in the work. In the submitted article, only learning from the masses by asking the poor and hired laborers is seen; the guiding intention is not clear. In addition, suspending all the work of the old cadres is also worth studying.

### 沙河新城工作队摸得初步经验　暗访贫雇收效不大表明态度打开局面

　　沙河新城工作队摸得初步经验
  　暗访贫雇收效不大表明态度打开局面
    【沙河消息】这次工作队到达新城镇，经十一天的摸索，有以下几点，提出供各地研究参考：
    工作队到村后，一头便钻到群众中去找贫雇，经四、五天时间，找见了十四个没翻透身的长年劳动的贫雇，目的要经过这几个贫雇来发动全村群众。可是这十四人非常没劲，领导上再三解释，他们总是不大胆，甚至有两个产量较高的贫雇不愿干了。这时领导上最苦闷，不知怎样干才对。后来工作队同志，进一步深入贫雇听取群众反映，进行研究，找这个村不起劲的根源：第一、在这几天，村干部与贫雇作对立，借口搞生产，一直开大会，不叫贫雇开小会，韩毛登说：“咱可不敢去开贫苦会，不参加大会，村干部可不行。”群众怕惹下祸，工作队走后，村干部报复，所以不敢接近我们。第二、领导上没有表明自己态度，贫雇也摸不住这些人是来干啥？大部群众说：“平均土地，工作员来给咱分开就算了吧。”有的说：“这回干部来，与以前大不同，也不找村干部，光在群众中钻，是调查啥哩？咱说话可得注意些哩。”特别是没有表明对支部党员、干部的态度，群众更不敢干。研究出以上问题后，依据具体情况，及群众的思想顾虑，才召开群众大会，将在职干部党员一律停止工作，进行反省检讨，同时还说明这次是依靠贫雇，巩固的团结中农，来进行填补、审查我们的党员……。这样一来，群众才不很顾虑了。开始提意见，倒起苦水来，有些说到干部对自己压迫，放声大哭。贫雇妇女周明的说：“我这次破出死也要倒出自己的苦水来，去年俺到北掌村开贫雇会，提了村干部几条意见，人家知道了，便记住我了，找我错报复。有一次我与旧妇女主席说了几句话，村干部便说我是特务、造谣，狠狠的吊打了一顿，还准备扣我四十天。”群众情绪很高，午饭后又自动的集合起来。这样个别串连、与大会宣传表明态度相互结合的方法，作用很大。
    由个别串连到大会诉苦后，领导上看见群众起了劲，也很高兴，再往下怎搞呢？又无了办法，苦闷起来，后便找了韩毛登、邢全成等六个可靠贫雇，依靠他们串连了四十个贫雇，进行研究，如何整顿队伍？刘柱福说：“旧干部不是都孬，也有好的。一律停止工作很对，可是咱得先把自己整顿好，和盖房一样，根脚扎不好、不正，可不行…。”于是在贫雇中展开了批评和自我批评，接着便初步研究成份，一面澄清贫雇内部的阶级面貌，另方面他们学习划成份的标准和方法。同时支部也开始进行整党站队，批评与自我批评，有些贫雇党员已反省出不少问题。工作同志高兴的说：“问群众就是有办法。”自此新城村，便打开了沉闷的局面。不久便要正式成立农会（或贫农团，由群众决定）公开党员，叫贫雇代表参加支部会，审查党员，定全村成份，进行抽补。（工作队、联合办公室合写）
    工作组能及时根据群众要求改变工作方式、确定工作步骤是很好的，但在领导上应有大概的方针和计划，才能正确引导群众前进，减少工作中的迷乱和弯路。来稿中只看到问贫雇向群众学习，指导意图，看不明确。另外旧干部一律停止工作，也值得研究。
