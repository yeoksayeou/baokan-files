　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: New York dispatch: The great strike of 500,000 American coal miners and meatpacking workers has continued for nine days as of the 24th. The miners' strike has effectively brought coal mining operations in all states to a standstill. According to American newspapers, there were over 61,000 "accident incidents" in the American mining industry in 1947, with over 1,100 miners tragically killed, but in the past eight months, the miners have not received a single cent in compensation. Despite this, the Truman government, after its so-called "mediation" failed, brazenly invoked the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law on the 24th, deciding to take brutal anti-strike measures. The strike of 100,000 meatpacking workers continues despite police interference. In addition, 13,000 of New York City's 15,000 fur workers have joined the wave of strikes for wage increases.

　　美国五十万工人坚持罢工达九天
  　杜鲁门竟施用野蛮镇压
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】纽约讯：美国五十万煤矿及肉类包装工人的大罢工，至二十四日止，已持续九日。矿工的罢工实际上已使各州的掘煤工作皆陷于停顿。据美报载称：四七年美矿业中共发生“失事事件”六万一千余件，矿工惨死者达一千一百余人，但在过去八月中，矿工并未得到分文恤金。虽然如此，杜鲁门政府在其所谓“调解”失败后，竟于二十四日悍然运用塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法，决定采取野蛮的禁止罢工措施。十万肉类包装工人的罢工则不顾警察的干涉，仍在继续中。此外，纽约市一万五千毛皮工人中，已有一万三千人卷入了增资罢工浪潮。
