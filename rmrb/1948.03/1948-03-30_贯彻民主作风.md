　　Implement Democratic Work Style
    The Wu'an Ninth District Work Group, in the rectification, democracy, and filling (of vacancies) movement, resolutely implemented a democratic work style, enabling the movement to develop normally. In the rectification and examination of party members, the group earnestly adopted the policy of verbal criticism and reasoning, without resorting to physical violence. It mobilized the masses to criticize bad party members as much as possible, while also giving party members the opportunity to defend themselves. Responsibilities were clearly defined, and fair punishments were given, satisfying both the masses and the party members, and establishing a new democratic order in the countryside.
    However, the realization of this policy went through a serious process of education and ideological struggle. It was necessary to let the peasants vent their anger, but also to prevent vindictive emotions from leading to phenomena such as indiscriminate beatings and detentions. This required the work group comrades to avoid a tailism tendency and to guide the masses well in advance. Otherwise, it was inevitable that serious phenomena such as indiscriminate beatings and detentions would occur, causing unrest among the peasants, and the movement would inevitably suffer setbacks.
    We must recognize that the bad practices of hanging, beating, and detaining people have their social roots and historical traditions, and their influence in the countryside is quite deep-seated. Both the masses and cadres are affected by it. Although everyone does not approve of indiscriminate beatings and detentions, when things get urgent, they unconsciously resort to these bad methods. Therefore, in the work process, when the masses put forward incorrect opinions, due to temporary radicalism, such as wanting to beat or detain people, it is necessary to patiently persuade them, explaining that this is a bad practice of the old society. In the past, bad cadres and bad party members also used this method to suppress the masses, which was wrong. It must be explained that only democratic reasoning can solve problems. As for the instigating behavior of a few radical elements, the masses must be encouraged to expose them and eliminate their influence among the masses, so as to prevent the masses from blindly echoing them.
    For this reason, it is necessary to fully realize the role of leadership. Without harming the enthusiasm of the masses, the leaders themselves must have a clear concept of the new work style and a firm attitude, enlighten the masses to engage in rational and reasoned struggle, guide the movement to develop in the correct direction, and gradually lay the foundation for a democratic order as the movement develops.

　　贯彻民主作风
    武安九区工作团在整党、民主、填补运动中，坚决贯彻民主作风，使运动得以正常发展。在整党审查党员时，切实的采取口头批评说理，不动手打人的方针，发动群众尽量批评坏党员，同时又予党员申辩机会，并分别责任予以公平处分，使群众与党员均感到满意，建立了农村民主新秩序。
    但这一方针的实现，是曾经过严重的教育与思想斗争过程的。既要让农民出气，又不为报复情绪所激而引起乱打乱扣等现象，这就要工作组同志不犯尾巴主义倾向，事前很好的诱导群众，否则不可免的要产生乱打乱扣等严重现象，引起农民间的不安，运动必然受到挫折。
    我们必须认识，吊打、扣压等恶劣作风，是有它的社会根源与历史传统的，它在农村中的影响相当深固。无论群众与干部中都受其影响，虽然大家都不赞成乱打乱扣，但一到情急时，就不知不觉要拿出这些坏办法来。因此在工作过程中，对于群众因一时偏激，而提出的要打要扣等不正确意见时，就必须耐心说服，说明这是旧社会的坏作风，从前坏干部、坏党员也曾用这办法来压制群众，这是不对的，说明只有民主讲理，才能解决问题。对少数偏激分子的煽动行为，必须启发群众自己起来加以揭露，消除他在群众中的影响，以免群众盲目附和。
    为此就必须充分实现领导作用，在不伤害群众热情的条件下，领导者必须自己有明确的新作风的观念和坚定的态度，启发群众合理的讲理斗争，引导运动向正确道路发展，并随着运动的发展，逐步的打下民主秩序的基础。
