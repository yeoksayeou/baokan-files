　　Hungarian Social Democratic Party Plans Merger with Hungarian Communist Party
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Budapest dispatch: The 36th Congress of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party was held here from the 6th to the 9th. According to the proposal of the party's General Secretary Szakasits, the Congress decided to authorize its leaders to hold talks with the Communist Party to discuss the merger into a unified workers' party, and requested the continued purge of right-wing reactionary elements within the party. When the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, Rákosi, paid tribute to the Congress, he pointed out: "This Congress will guide democracy and Hungary to a new and great development. In our country, the days of mutual struggle between the laboring masses led by the two parties are gone forever. Our task is to lead the broad masses onto the road of happiness and peace. The spirit of socialism enables us to accomplish our tasks." After the meeting, Szakasits announced at a press conference on the 10th: "The merger of our party with the Communist Party is voluntary, and this merger is a guarantee for Hungary's independence, democracy, and freedom."
