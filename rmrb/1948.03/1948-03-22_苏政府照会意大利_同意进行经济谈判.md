Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS, Moscow reports: The Soviet government sent another note to the Italian government on March 9th, pointing out that, in its notes to the Soviet Union in November of last year and January of this year, the Italian government repeatedly expressed its willingness to conduct economic and trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has agreed and welcomes the Italian government to send a delegation to Moscow for negotiations. However, the Soviet government believes that while negotiating the total amount of trade, payment agreements, and navigation treaties, the issue of Italy's delivery of reparations to the Soviet Union should also be discussed. The note stated that once an agreement on the issue of reparations is reached, all economic and trade relations between the Soviet Union and Italy will be readily resolved and will benefit both countries. The Soviet government also suggested that, on the issues of trade and navigation, both countries should base their principles on most-favored-nation status.

    苏政府照会意大利　同意进行经济谈判
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府于三月九日再度给意政府照会一件，指出：由于意政府在去年十一月及今年一月致苏联照会中，一再表示愿与苏联进行经济贸易谈判，苏政府已表同意，并欢迎意政府派遣代表团来莫斯科谈判。但苏政府认为：在谈判贸易总额、支付协定及通航条约同时，应讨论意大利对苏赔偿的交货问题。照会声明：赔偿问题协定达成后，苏意一切经济与贸易关系问题，将会迎刃而解，并有利于两国。苏政府并建议在贸易与通航问题上，二国都应以最惠国的原则为根据。
