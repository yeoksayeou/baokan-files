Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th. When the news of the great victory at Yichuan reached the former high-ranking Chiang Hu military officers who had laid down their weapons here, they immediately got up, put on their clothes, lit their lamps, and discussed it enthusiastically for half the night, even though they were already asleep. Li Weigang, the former Lieutenant General and Brigade Commander of the 167th Brigade of the Hu Army, believed that Liu Kan and Dong Zhao were Hu Zongnan's right-hand men, and now one of them had been removed. Liu Ziqi, the former Lieutenant General and Brigade Commander of the 123rd Brigade of the Hu Army, believed that Hu Zongnan would have fewer and fewer mobile forces in the future, and it would not only be impossible to attack but also difficult to maintain mobile defense, so he would have to hold on to points and lines and wait to be annihilated. Liao Ang, the former Lieutenant General and Division Commander of the 76th Division of the Hu Army, said more humorously: "Even if we put ourselves in Hu Zongnan's shoes, it would be difficult for us to come up with a good way to deal with the People's Liberation Army." Liu Xuechao, Liao Ang's chief of staff, ridiculed Hu Zongnan, saying, "Last year, the People's Liberation Army could only eat one or two brigades at a time, but now it can eat five brigades at once; Hu Zongnan only sent away one or two brigades last year, but now he can send away five brigades at once, which cannot but be said to be a great improvement on his part." They were all originally subordinates of Liu Kan, so they all excitedly talked about: "In the past, Hu Zongnan and Liu Kan always scolded us for not knowing how to fight, but now the person who scolds people not only gives away more gifts, but is also killed himself!" What they are most concerned about are the many old friends who are still in the Chiang army. At a time when the situation of victory and defeat between the People's Liberation Army and the Chiang army is very clear, they hope that they should wisely choose their own path and not follow in Liu Kan's footsteps.

　　听到我军宜川大捷消息
  　被俘胡匪军官鼓舞
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】当宜川大捷的消息传到此间放下武器的前蒋胡高级军官时，他们虽已睡下，立即披衣起床点灯，热烈议论了半夜。前胡军一六七旅中将旅长李为岗认为刘戡董钊是胡宗南的左右手，现已削去其一。前胡军一二三旅中将旅长刘子奇以为胡宗南今后机动兵力愈少，不仅不可能进攻即维持机动防御亦很困难，只好固守点线坐以待歼。前胡军七十六师中将师长廖昂更幽默的说：“我们即使替胡宗南设身处地着想，也很难替他想出一条对付解放军的好办法。”廖昂的参谋长刘学超嘲笑胡宗南说：“去年解放军一次只能吃掉一两个旅，现在却一下吃掉五个旅；胡宗南去年一下只送掉一两个旅，现在却能一下送掉五个旅，这不能不说是他的一大进步。”他们原来都是刘戡的部下，因此他们都兴奋的谈论着：“过去胡宗南刘戡老是骂我们不会打仗，现在骂人的人不仅送礼送得更多，连自己也被打死了！”他们所最关心的是许多仍在蒋军中的旧友，在目前的解放军与蒋军胜败局势已十分明显的时候，希望他们应该明智的选择他们自己的道路，不要步刘戡后尘。
