    [Taihang News] Cadres and staff of the Taihang Xinhua Daily, the Taihang Xinhua Branch, and workers of the printing factory, responding to the call of the Border Region Government, enthusiastically donated money to support the disaster-stricken compatriots in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

Worker Zhao San donated 11,500 yuan of his salary, Wang Zixian 11,000 yuan, and three workers, including Ma Jingbo, each donated 10,000 yuan. Cadre Hou Heshang also donated 10,000 yuan of his savings. Furthermore, all teachers, students, and service staff of the Administrative Office's Women's Vocational School, after reading the report, said, "Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia is where Chairman Mao is, and the people have suffered from the disaster caused by the Jiang bandits. We must provide relief!" They also donated 26,068 yuan. All of the above funds have been handed over to the Administrative Office for forwarding.
    [Wu'an News] After reading the article "The Border Region Government Calls on the Entire Region to Donate to Disaster-Stricken Compatriots in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia," everyone at the Eighth High School unanimously hated the atrocities of the Jiang-Hu bandit troops and were very concerned about the 400,000 disaster-stricken compatriots in the Border Region who lacked food and clothing. Everyone enthusiastically donated. The seven faculty members alone donated 7,100 yuan, and the three cooks donated over 1,300 yuan. The students currently at the school have donated 14,100 yuan, totaling 21,500 yuan donated by teachers and students at the school. The donations have been sent to the county government.
