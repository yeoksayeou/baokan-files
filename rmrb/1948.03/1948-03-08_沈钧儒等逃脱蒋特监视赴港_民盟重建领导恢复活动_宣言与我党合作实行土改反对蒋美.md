Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: Hong Kong Dispatch: After the China Democratic League was forcibly declared "automatically liberated" by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on November 5th of last year, its central committee members, including Shen Junru, escaped the surveillance of Chiang's secret agents and secretly went to Hong Kong from Shanghai. On January 5th of this year, leading figures of the China Democratic League, including Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zemin, and Zhou Xinmin, held the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League in Hong Kong, deciding to rebuild the leadership organs of the China Democratic League, issuing a declaration denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang bandit gang as a reactionary group representing China's landlords and comprador class, and as a tool for US aggression in China. The declaration proposed four points: to smash the Chiang Kai-shek regime, thoroughly implement land reform, oppose US aggression against China, and form a democratic united front with all democratic parties. The four proposals announced in the China Democratic League's January 5th declaration are as follows:

	I.	In the past, our league advocated striving for democracy through peace and striving for openness through legal means. However, today, since the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary dictatorial clique has closed the door to peace and does not allow the existence of any opposition party that disagrees with one-party dictatorship, it is no longer possible to achieve China's peace and democracy through negotiation and compromise. We must smash a dictatorial, reactionary, corrupt, and ineffective regime to establish a new, peaceful, democratic, clean, and effective regime. Therefore, we must mobilize and lead the people of the whole country to actively engage in this struggle from now on.

	II.	Regarding the dictatorial Kuomintang reactionary clique, what we oppose is not just the dictator himself, but the entire group representing the landlords, local tyrants, comprador class, and feudalism. To completely eliminate the rule of the entire reactionary group, the Chinese people must eliminate the economic foundation on which this reactionary rule depends, that is, to completely eliminate the feudal exploitative land relations and implement "land to the tiller," thoroughly implementing land reform.

	III.	Resolutely oppose the current US policy towards China, oppose the US treating China as a base for anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities in the Far East, and oppose all direct and indirect actions by US reactionaries that harm China's sovereignty. Our league is also willing to call the attention of the US government to the fact that the Chinese people will never recognize any treaties signed between the US government and the Nanjing government that harm the interests of the Chinese people, and believes that all assistance provided by the US government to the Nanjing government will be considered as being enemies of the Chinese people.

	IV.	In order to oppose dictatorship and national betrayal and realize genuine democracy and peace, our league is willing to firmly welcome the cooperation of all democratic parties, and to form a strong democratic united front with all democratic parties. The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of democracy, and its history of struggle is worthy of admiration by every patriotic Chinese. Our league wants to work hand in hand with them. At the same time, regarding the recent establishment of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, because it is the Kuomintang's rebirth, our league is willing to fight together with them.

The China Democratic League's declaration concludes: Internally, we will strengthen unity with the people and various democratic parties; externally, we will unite with the democratic forces of the world and the oppressed nations of Asia to strive for the realization of world peace and democracy.

　　沈钧儒等逃脱蒋特监视赴港
  　民盟重建领导恢复活动
    宣言与我党合作实行土改反对蒋美
    【新华社华中六日电】香港通讯：民主同盟于去年十一月五日被蒋介石匪帮强迫宣告“自动解放”后，其中央委员沈钧儒等沈脱蒋匪特务的监视，由上海潜赴香港。今年一月五日，民主同盟的领导人物沈钧儒、章伯钧、彭泽民、周新民等在香港召开民盟的三中全会，决定重建民盟的领导机关，发表宣言，痛斥蒋介石国民党匪帮是代表中国地主买办的反动集团，是美国在华侵略的工具；提出粉碎蒋介石政权，彻底实行土地改革，反对美国侵略中国，及与一切民主党派结成民主统一战线等四项主张。民盟一月五日宣言所宣布的四项主张如下：
    一、过去本盟主张以和平争民主，以合法争公开，但在今天南京国民党反动独裁集团既已关闭和平之门，且又不能容许任何不同意一党专政的反对党存在，则要实现中国的和平民主，已不可能由谈判妥协求之，我们必须粉碎一个独裁、反动、贪污、腐化的政权，才能建立一个和平、民主、廉洁、有效能的新政权。是以我们今后必须发动领导全国人民，积极从事此项斗争。
    二、对于独裁的国民党反动集团，我们要反对的不只是独裁者个人，而是那代表地主、豪绅、买办、封建的整个集团。为了彻底消灭整个反动集团的统治，中国人民就得消灭这一反动统治所寄托的经济基础，那就是彻底消灭封建剥削的土地关系，实行耕者有其田，彻底实行土地改革。
    三、坚决反对美国目前的对华政策，反对美国把中国当成远东反苏反共的基地，反对美国反动派一切直接间接危害中国主权的行为。本盟并且愿意唤起美国政府的注意，中国人民决不承认美国政府与南京政府所签订的一切损害中国人民利益的条约；并认为美国政府给予南京政府的所有援助，将是与中国人民为敌。
    四、为了反对独裁卖国，实现真正的民主和平，本盟愿意坚决欢迎一切民主党派的合作，而且与一切民主党派结成坚强的民主统一战线。中国共产党为民主之先进，其奋斗的历史，值得每个爱国的中国人赞佩，本盟要与他们携手合作；同时对于最近国民党革命委员会的成立，因为他是国民党的新生，本盟愿与共同奋斗。
    民盟宣言最后说：我们对内加强团结人民与各民主党派，对外与全世界的民主力量及亚洲的被压迫民族联合起来，为实现全世界的和平民主而奋斗。
