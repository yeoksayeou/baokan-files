Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 7th: The Frontline Headquarters of the Northwest People's Liberation Army announced the initial results of the great victory southwest of Yichuan on March 1, stating: In this battle, the entire headquarters of the Hu bandit's reorganized 29th Army, the reorganized 90th Division, the two division headquarters of the 27th Division, and their affiliated 31st Brigade, 47th Brigade, 53rd Brigade, and 61st Brigade, totaling more than 23,000 officers and soldiers, were annihilated. Among them, over 5,000 bandit soldiers were killed or wounded, including the commander of the reorganized 29th Army, Liu Kan, the commander of the reorganized 90th Division, Yan Ming, the commander of the reorganized 27th Division, Wang Yingzun, the commander of the reorganized 31st Brigade, Zhou Tianzhi, and the commander of the reorganized 47th Brigade, Li Da. 18,252 bandit soldiers were captured alive, including the Chief of Staff of the Reorganized 29th Army, Liu Zhenshi, the Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters, Wu Zhengde, the Deputy Commander of the Reorganized 27th Division, Li Qiheng, the Chief of Staff of the Reorganized 90th Division, Zeng Wensi, the Chief of Staff of the Reorganized 61st Brigade, Zhang Jiqi, the Commander of the 140th Regiment of the Reorganized 47th Brigade, Xing Zhidong, the Deputy Commander of the 158th Regiment of the Reorganized 53rd Brigade, Yi Shengzhen, the Commander of the 159th Regiment, An Hannan, and the Commander of the 183rd Regiment of the Reorganized 61st Brigade, Liu Tongfu. Seized were seven heavy mortars, sixty 82mm mortars, eighty-eight 60mm mortars, twelve grenade launchers and projectors, two hundred and forty-seven heavy machine guns, six hundred and seventy-six light machine guns and automatic rifles, four hundred and seventeen Sten submachine guns and carbines, four thousand seven hundred and five rifles and carbines, three hundred and ten pistols, over one thousand rounds of various artillery shells, one million one hundred thousand rounds of various bullets, six vehicles, sixteen radio stations, eight transceivers, one hundred and twenty-nine telephones (including twelve switchboards), twenty-four binoculars, and one hundred and fifty-nine mules and horses. (The results of our army's capture of Yichuan city and annihilation of the enemy's 24th Brigade will be announced separately in the near future.)

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 7th: The Reorganized 29th Army of the Chiang Hu bandits, led by Commander Liu Kan, and the 90th Division of the First Army, were the most elite units of the Hu bandits. They were organized as an "A" grade division, well-equipped, and partially equipped with American weaponry. The Reorganized 27th Division was also a relatively strong force among the existing troops of the Hu bandits. The above-mentioned two bandit armies had previously suffered annihilating blows from the Liberation Army. This time, to rescue Yichuan, except for a portion of the remnants that could not be mobilized, the entire reinforcement force was annihilated. The Reorganized 53rd Brigade, under the jurisdiction of the Reorganized 90th Division, had its entire 158th Regiment annihilated when our army liberated Hancheng last November. This time, our army annihilated its brigade headquarters and all three regiments. The Reorganized 61st Brigade had its 182nd Regiment annihilated when our army liberated Yichuan last October. The remnants were transferred to Yuncheng for replenishment and were again annihilated during the first liberation of Yuncheng on December 28. This time, the brigade headquarters and the 181st and 183rd Regiments were thoroughly annihilated. The 31st Brigade of the Reorganized 27th Division has also been annihilated three times, first in the Jinan Campaign in the previous year, and then again in the Qinghuabian Campaign northeast of Yan'an last year (missing the 91st Regiment). Brigade Commander Li Jiyun was captured. This time, the brigade headquarters and the 92nd Regiment were annihilated for the third time (missing the 91st and 93rd Regiments). The Reorganized 47th Brigade was also partially annihilated in the Jinan Campaign in the previous year. After occupying Yan'an last year, it was responsible for defense and was regarded by the Hu bandits as one of the two "elite brigades" (the other being the annihilated 167th Brigade), but this time the brigade was completely annihilated (missing the 141st Regiment).

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 7th: After the Liberation Army concluded the annihilation battle southwest of Yichuan, the body of Hu bandit Liu Kan, commander of the reorganized 29th Army, who was killed by artillery fire to the head during the rout, was buried plainly, and a wooden sign was erected at the grave, inscribed with "Grave of Liu Kan." Liu faithfully implemented the anti-people policies of the Chiang Hu bandits during his lifetime, committing numerous crimes, but the People's Liberation Army, based on humanitarian principles, still buried him. The Frontline Headquarters of the Liberation Army specially entrusted the Shaanbei Xinhua News Agency to broadcast a message to the family and relatives of Liu Kan, saying: "Liu Kan has made a futile sacrifice for the Chiang Hu's traitorous civil war in the battle southwest of Yichuan on March 1. His remains have been buried by our army in the mountainous area three miles south of Yangdao Village, west of Yichuan City. If you come to transport the body, the military and civilians of the liberated area will provide convenience."

    【新华社西北七日电】蒋胡匪整编二十九军军长刘戡率领的第一军九十师为胡匪最精锐的部队，属甲种师编制，装备优良，配有部分美械。整编二十七师亦为胡匪现有部队中战斗力较强的。上述两部匪军先后均曾遭受解放军歼灭性打击，此次救援宜川，除未及调动之部分残匪外，援军全部被歼。整编九十师所辖整五十三旅，去年十一月我军解放韩城时，歼灭其一五八团全部，此次我军又将其旅部及三个团全歼。整编六十一旅，去年十月我军解放宜川时，歼其一八二团，残部开住运城补充，后又于十二月二十八日运城首次解放时被歼，此次该旅旅部及一八一团、一八三团又遭到彻底歼灭。整编二十七师三十一旅亦已被歼三次，首于前年七月晋南战役中复灭，继又于去年在延安东北青化砭战役中被歼（缺九一团），旅长李纪云被俘，此次该旅旅部及九二团第三次被歼（缺九一团、九三团）。整编四十七旅，亦于前年七月晋南战役中被歼一部，去年侵占延安后，即担任守备，胡匪视为两个“劲旅”之一（另一个是被歼的一六七旅），但此次战役中该旅又遭全歼（缺一四一团）。
    【新华社西北七日电】解放军在宜川西南歼灭战结束后，将在溃乱中被炮弹击中头部毙命之胡匪整二十九军军长刘戡尸体素里埋葬，并在墓地竖立木牌，上题“刘戡之墓”。刘生前忠实执行蒋胡匪反人民政策，罪行垒垒，但人民解放军仍本道义，将其掩埋。解放军前线司令部并特委托陕北新华社广播，通告刘戡之家属亲友说：“刘戡已在三月一日宜川西南地区战斗中，为蒋胡卖国内战作无谓牺牲，遗尸已由本军埋葬于宜川城西羊道村南三里之山地中，你们如果来运尸体，解放区军民必予方便”。
