    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Helsinki dispatch: Following Stalin's letter to the Finnish President on February 22nd, suggesting negotiations for a Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance treaty, intense debates ensued between the democratic and reactionary camps within Finland.

According to various reports, the Finnish government has appointed a delegation to travel to Moscow within days to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union for the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. The delegation is led by Prime Minister Pekkala and includes the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Interior, and several members of parliament. The head of the delegation has the authority to sign the treaty. Moscow newspapers predict that the negotiations have a hopeful chance of success.
