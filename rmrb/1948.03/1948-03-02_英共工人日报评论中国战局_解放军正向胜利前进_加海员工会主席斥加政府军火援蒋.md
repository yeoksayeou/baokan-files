　　British Communist Party's "Worker's Daily" Comments on the Chinese War Situation
　　The People's Liberation Army is Advancing Towards Victory
    Canadian Seafarers' Union Chairman Condemns Canadian Government's Arms Aid to Chiang Kai-shek
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: London dispatch: The British Communist Party's newspaper "Worker's Daily" commented on the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the 27th, writing: "For the Chinese people, 1948 will be a great year. In this year, they will advance victoriously towards their final victory." The newspaper compared the increasing strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with the gradual shrinking of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and pointed out that the PLA is now equipped with captured American-made weapons, saying: "These American weapons were originally intended to kill innocent Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, but now they are being used to overthrow the reactionary government supported by the United States."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, Ottawa, 27th: Canadian Seafarers' Union Chairman Davis delivered a speech at the Toronto Federation of Labor Congress, denouncing the Canadian government for supplying Chiang Kai-shek with weapons. Davis urged the Canadian people to oppose this action by the Canadian government and stop shipping these weapons and munitions intended to kill the Chinese people. Davis said: The Seafarers' Union has once again protested to the Canadian government regarding aid to Chiang, and the union's attitude is the same as when it protested against the export of scrap iron to Japan in 1938. Davis pointed out that the Canadian government's actions to aid Chiang are aimed at launching a third world war. Davis also revealed that newspapers controlled by the Canadian government distort the development situation in China, defend the Kuomintang, and attempt to deceive the Canadian people. He said: Many missionaries and reporters returning from China have asserted that the Kuomintang government represents a corrupt, feudal, and dictatorial regime opposed by all strata of the Chinese people.＊

  　解放军正向胜利前进
    加海员工会主席斥加政府军火援蒋
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】伦敦消息：英共机关报“工人日报”于二十七日评论中国人民解放军的胜利时写道：“对于中国人民，一九四八年将是伟大的一年。这一年中，他们将向他们的最后胜利的目标胜利前进。”该报将中国人民解放军的日益强大和蒋介石军队的日渐缩小作一对比，并于指出解放军现在配备有缴获的美制武器时称：“这些美国武器原来想用来杀害无辜的中国人民和解放军的，而现在却被用来推翻美国支持的反动政府了”。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据塔斯社渥太华二十七日电：加拿大海员工会主席戴维斯在多伦多职工联合会大会上发表演说，痛斥加政府以武器供应蒋介石。戴氏敦促加拿大人民反对加政府此种行动，停止装运这些意图杀害中国人民的武器和军火。戴氏说：海员工会已对援蒋事再度向加政府提出抗议，工会的态度如象一九三八年抗议废铁输日时一样。戴氏指出加政府援蒋的行动，其目的在于发动第三次世界大战。戴氏并揭露加政府控制下的报纸歪曲中国发展情势，为国民党辩护，企图以此欺骗加拿大人民，他说：很多从中国归来的传教士和记者都断言国民党政府代表着为中国所有各阶层人民所反对的腐败封建的独裁统治。＊
