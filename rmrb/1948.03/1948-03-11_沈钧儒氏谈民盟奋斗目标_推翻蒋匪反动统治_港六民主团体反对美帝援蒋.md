Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th: Late news from Hong Kong: Mr. Shen Junru, leader of the China Democratic League, stated at a press conference on February 2nd that the League's current goal is to overthrow the reactionary and dictatorial Kuomintang government. The League is willing to sincerely cooperate with all democratic parties to achieve this goal. The League opposes the reactionary policy of the United States aiding Chiang Kai-shek's aggression against China and slaughtering the Chinese people. Mr. Shen severely criticized the reactionary Kuomintang government for its past persecution of the League, even declaring it "illegal." Mr. Shen expressed that League members at home and abroad are continuing to strengthen their solidarity with the people, striving to overthrow the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, and announced that twenty-nine League leaders have arrived in Hong Kong. Mr. Shen expressed excitement over the victory of the People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive, pointing out that the Kuomintang's military situation "has reached a dangerous point." A democratic coalition government will eventually be established in China.

Also reported: A spokesperson for the Hong Kong headquarters of the China Democratic League on the 3rd of this month denounced the Chiang Kai-shek party's recent slander of the League as a "disguised Communist organization," saying that the purpose of this propaganda is to "further persecute democratic elements." The spokesperson pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang "has committed heinous crimes, shamelessly selling out national interests, and offering China's sovereignty, specifically military bases, seaports, and inland river navigation rights, to the United States. All of these are traitorous acts."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th: Late news: The China Democratic League, the National Salvation Association, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and other six democratic groups issued a joint declaration in Hong Kong at the beginning of last month, protesting against U.S. imperialism's preparation to provide Chiang Kai-shek with a loan of $570 million. The declaration stated: The current Nanjing dictatorial government, which persecutes democratic parties, arrests students, and conducts an anti-people civil war, does not represent the Chinese people. The entire Chinese people oppose this government. By actively aiding Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. government is encouraging civil war in China and interfering in China's internal affairs.

    【新华社华中八日电】迟到消息：民盟、救国会、国民党革命委员会等六民主团体，上月初于香港发表联合宣言，抗议美帝准备以五亿七千万美元贷款援助蒋介石。宣言内称：当前迫害民主政党、逮捕学生及进行反人民内战的南京独裁政府，并不代表中国人民。全中国人民皆反对此一政府。由于积极的援助蒋介石，美国政府正鼓励着中国的内战，和干涉中国的内政。
