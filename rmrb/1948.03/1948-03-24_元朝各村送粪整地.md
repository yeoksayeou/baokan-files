      Yuan Dynasty Villages Sending Manure to Prepare the Land
    [Yuan Dynasty News] After our county deployed production at the county-wide cadre meeting, and after a week of propaganda, the masses' ideological doubts have been largely resolved, and manure delivery and land preparation have now begun. Many poor peasants used to wait for equal distribution. For example, Qi Fangzhai, a poor peasant in Dongmeng Village, Second District, said: "After the Land Law was posted, I felt it was reliable and wanted to divide the land. But when I heard that our county would still be engaged in production in the first half of the year, I was a little disappointed." After the propaganda, everyone cheered up, but due to the lack of farm tools, livestock, and land, there are still many difficulties in production. The county has specially issued 20 million in low-interest loans to solve these difficulties. In the past, middle peasants were afraid of touching floating wealth and disrupting the equal distribution. After the propaganda of the Land Law, most of their ideological problems were resolved. In Li Maling, Fifth District, four households were delivering manure in the light rain, and three new flour mills were opened. Of the twenty-two plots of land from Xiaozhai to Maling, ten have been harrowed and two have been plowed. Guo Jun, a middle peasant in Beilizhuang, Second District, used to have the fattest calf in the village. After the Land Law was posted, it became thin from hunger. After the propaganda, he said: "It still has to be fed fat." Zhang Shumeng, a middle peasant in Xijiahe, First District, used to be afraid of touching floating wealth. After the explanation, he planted fifty saplings the next day. Now, more than 40,000 trees have been planted in Xijiahe and Dongjiahe. The whole county has now started preparing the land and delivering manure.

      元朝各村送粪整地
    【元朝消息】我县于全县干部会上布置生产后，经过一周宣传，群众思想疑虑大部解决，现已开始送粪整地。不少贫农过去是等待平分，如二区东孟村贫农齐芳斋说：“土地法贴出后觉着可照啦，想分地，一听说咱县上半年还是闹生产，有点失望。”经宣传后，大家提起劲来，不过因农具牲畜及土地缺乏，生产中还有不少困难，县里特发放二千万低利贷款解决困难，中农过去怕动浮财怕打乱平分，经过宣传土地法，大部思想解决。五区李马陵下着小雨有四户送粪，又新开张了三座粉坊，从小寨到马陵廿二块地，已有十块耙好，二块犁妥。二区北李庄中农郭钧喂的小牛全村数他的肥，土地法贴出后，饿瘦了，经过宣传，他说：“还是得喂的肥肥的。”一区西夹河中农张书孟，以前怕动浮财，经过解释第二天栽了五十棵小树，现在东西夹河已栽四万余棵树，现全县已经开始整地送粪了。
