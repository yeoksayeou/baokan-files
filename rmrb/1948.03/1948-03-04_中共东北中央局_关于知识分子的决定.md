  　Decision on Intellectuals in the Northeast

　　The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the "Decision on Intellectuals in the Northeast" on the 15th of last month. The decision first clarifies the progressive role of intellectuals in the Chinese revolutionary movement, their shortcomings, and the consistent policy adopted by our party towards intellectuals: to win them over, educate them, and transform them. It then states: "Two incorrect deviations have occurred within the Party in the Northeast in the treatment of old intellectuals: one is the failure to thoroughly transform the old ruling institutions, management institutions, and old systems (government, industry and mining, railways, etc.) of the puppet Manchukuo; blindly believing in old employees and recognizing old systems; and failing to boldly mobilize workers and peasants and absorb them into the new management institutions. Severe criticism and correction of this incorrect deviation is absolutely necessary. The other is that some cadres, after proposing party rectification, ideological rectification, land reform education, etc., simply and indiscriminately cleansed intellectuals in some troops and institutions based on their family background and class composition. The Party's proposed line of poor and lower-middle peasants is mainly a guiding principle for rural land reform, but some comrades mechanically applied it to government organs, schools, and even all other departments. Some middle schools even simply cleansed students and dismissed teachers based on their landlord and rich peasant family backgrounds. This incorrect deviation must also be corrected." Therefore, the Northeast Bureau makes the following seven decisions: "(1) All troops and government organs must continue to conduct investigations into class, ideology, stance, work style, and lifestyle; oppose landlord and rich peasant ideology; eliminate corruption and waste; and oppose bureaucracy. The purpose of investigating class is to clarify class composition and oppose concealment and false reporting of composition; but it is not possible to simply cleanse people based on composition. Those landlords and rich peasants who evade struggle and hide in government organs and troops can be cleansed and handed over to the peasants for handling. As for intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds, all those who perform well in their work should be won over, educated, and continuously transformed, without cleansing them, giving them work, and continuing to test them in their work. Those who perform poorly in their work should be criticized and educated according to the severity of their cases. Only those who engage in sabotage activities, oppose land reform, act as special agents for the Kuomintang, and cannot be won over and transformed must be cleansed. (2) Students in cadre schools generally adopt the method of ideological transformation, and only those who are ultimately proven unreformable are cleansed. Except for the children of heinous traitors, local bullies, big landlords, and Kuomintang special agents, as long as they are willing to reform and demand progress, generally children of landlords and rich peasants can be admitted to the school. (3) Continue to implement the policy of ideological transformation in ordinary middle schools: generally, it is not appropriate to refuse to enroll children of landlords and rich peasants. In middle schools with existing Party leadership, as long as housing conditions permit, a large number of students should be enrolled, and after ideological transformation, they should be introduced to work or enter other cadre schools. Middle schools that do not yet have Party leadership do not need to expand enrollment for the time being, nor do they need to be closed down. Teacher training schools or teacher training classes must be appropriately selective when enrolling students. (4) Except for a few rural primary school teachers who collude with landlords and sabotage land reform, generally all should be won over and educated to continue to serve the peasants. Urban primary school teachers who perform well in their work and have no political problems should continue to be absorbed into their work and encouraged to move forward. Middle school teachers who meet the following three conditions: not engaging in counter-revolutionary activities; not disrupting the work of the school; sympathizing with the peasant land reform movement; being loyal to their duties, should not be cleansed, and should continue to be won over. (5) Except for the two levels of government in districts and villages and the peasant associations, which will not temporarily absorb intellectuals, governments at all levels above the county level and financial, economic, trade, taxation, industrial and mining, transportation, and other government organs can absorb selected intellectuals to participate in the work. Children of landlords and rich peasants who participate in physical labor should not be cleansed as long as they do not engage in conspiracy, sabotage, or espionage work. When they have participated in labor for a certain number of years, they can be given the rights of workers, and children of landlords and rich peasants are welcome to transform themselves in labor. (6) Technical experts, engineers, technicians, doctors, etc., should be won over to continue their work, and appropriate preferential treatment should be given according to their technical capabilities. Some of them may have used the power of the puppet Manchukuo to oppress workers in the past. After they sincerely confess to the workers, reflect on themselves, and admit their mistakes, they should still be won over to continue their work. Those who are engaged in conspiracy and sabotage and are confirmed to be acting as special agents for the Kuomintang should be dealt with according to the severity of their cases. (7) While winning over old intellectuals, we must also pay attention to cultivating new intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds. We should provide worker and peasant children with convenient access to education in various schools, and open technical schools and worker children's schools for workers in various large enterprises and cities. Trade unions and governments should give full attention and necessary assistance as possible."

　　中共东北中央局
  　关于知识分子的决定
    中共东北中央局上月十五日颁布“关于东北知识分子的决定”。该决定首先阐明知识分子在中国革命运动中的进步作用及其缺点与我党对待知识分子所采取争取、教育、改造的一贯方针。继称：“东北党内对待旧的知识分子曾发生两种不正确的偏向：一种是对伪满旧的统治机构、管理机构和旧的制度（政权、工矿、铁路等等）不敢加以彻底的改造，盲目的相信旧职员、承认旧制度；不敢放手发动工农，并吸收他们参加到新的管理机构内来；对于这种不正确的偏向给以严重的批评和纠正是完全必须的。另一种是某些干部在提出整党整思想土改教育后，在某些部队和机关中，简单的根据知识分子的出身成份而无区别的加以洗刷。党所提的贫雇农路线，主要是对农村土地改革的指导方针，而某些同志机械的搬到机关学校甚至一切其他部门中去，个别的中学甚至简单的根据地主富农出身的成份而清洗学生、辞退教员、这种不正确的偏向也必须加以纠正。”因此东北局特作下述七项决定：“（一）各部队机关必须继续进行查阶级、查思想、查立场、查作风、查生活，反对地主富农思想，肃清贪污腐化、反对官僚主义。查阶级的目的是为着弄清阶级成份，反对隐瞒与假报成份；但不能简单根据成份来洗刷，凡是地主富农逃避斗争，隐藏在机关部队者，可以洗刷并交给农民去处理。而地主富农子弟出身的知识分子，凡在工作中表现好者，一律应采取争取教育，继续改造，不要洗刷，给以工作，并在工作中继续考验。在工作中表现不好者，要分别轻重批评教育，只有对那些进行破坏活动，反对土地改革，为国民党作特务活动，以及无法争取改造者才必须加以洗刷。（二）干部学校的学生，一般采取思想改造的办法，只有最后证明不能改造时才加以洗刷。除罪大恶极之汉奸恶霸大地主子弟及国民党特务分子外，只要本人愿意改造要求进步，一般地主富农子弟均可吸收入学。（三）普通中学内继续进行思想改造的方针：一般拒绝招收地主富农子弟是不应该的。在已有党的领导的中学内，只要房屋条件许可，均应大批招生，经过思想改造，介绍参加工作或进其他干部学校。今天还没有党的领导的中学，虽不必扩大招生，暂时也不必停办。师范学校或师范班招收学生时，则须加以适当的选择。（四）农村小学教员除个别与地主勾结，破坏土地改革者外，一般均应争取教育，使之继续为农民服务。城市的小学教员工作表现好而无政治问题者，应继续吸收其工作并鼓励其前进。对中学教员在下列三个条件下：即不作反革命活动；不破坏学校的工作；同情农民土地改革运动；忠实于自己的职务，不要清洗，应继续争取。（五）除区村两个政权及农会暂时不吸收知识分子外，县以上各级政府及财经、贸易、税收、工矿、交通等机关，均可吸收经过选择的知识分子参加工作。参加体力劳动的地主富农出身的子弟，只要不作阴谋破坏特务工作，均不应清洗。并当他参加劳动满一定的工龄之后，可给予工人的权利，欢迎地主富农子弟在劳动中改造自己。（六）对技术专家、工程师、技师、医生等应争取其继续工作，并根据其技术能力给予适当的优待。他们之中过去某些人曾借伪满势力，欺压过工人者，在他们诚恳向工人坦白反省，承认错误后，仍应争取其继续工作，对于那些阴谋破坏及为国民党作特务确实有据者，则应分别轻重加以处理。（七）在争取旧的知识分子中，同时必须注意培养工农子弟新的知识分子，应在各种学校中给予工农子弟以升学的方便，并在各种大企业及城市中，为工农开设技术学校及工人子弟学校。工会及政府均应给予充分的注意和必要的可能的帮助。”
