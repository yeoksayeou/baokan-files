Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: The Greek Democratic Army continues its victorious advance. According to a broadcast from the Free Greece radio station on February 25th: A unit under General Markos continued its advance towards Athens and, on the evening of February 13th, captured part of the city of Livadia in the region of Roumeli (near the railway line ninety kilometers northwest of Athens). According to an official announcement from the Athens puppet government on February 25th: The Democratic Army actively attacked in various parts of the Morea Peninsula last week, capturing the city of Sitian on February 21st, as well as many villages in the suburbs of the two major cities of Patras (on the railway line at the northern end of the peninsula) and Kalamata (on the railway line at the southern end of the peninsula). Under the continuous blows of the Democratic Army, the strength of the Athens puppet government's forces has been increasingly depleted. Recently, the reactionary government has ordered the forced conscription of teenagers aged thirteen to eighteen to serve as cannon fodder.

The powerful offensive of the Democratic Army and the declining state of the Greek puppet government have caused great anxiety to the U.S. imperialists. On the one hand, Truman cried out in Congress: "Help the Greek government fight the guerrillas." On the other hand, it implemented more frenzied armed intervention. The result of recent talks between the U.S.-British military mission and the Greek puppet government was a decision that all command of Greek combat troops would be executed by the U.S.-British military mission, with the United States taking primary responsibility. At the same time, U.S. imperialism urgently dispatched Van Fleet to Greece to replace Levis as head of the military mission. In addition, according to the head of the U.S. aid mission to Greece, Griswold, "180 senior U.S. military officers are currently directly commanding Greek troops in combat."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: New York dispatch: The American people are rising up to oppose the Truman government's armed intervention in Greece. On the 18th of last month, two hundred anti-fascist organizations held a large demonstration in front of the Greek consulate here, protesting against the American armed intervention in Greece, and submitted a memorandum to the Greek consulate, severely denouncing the atrocities of the Greek royalist fascists against democrats, and demanding the restoration of the freedom of citizens in Greece. The American Communist Party's Worker's Daily strongly criticized the American armed intervention, which fueled the Greek civil war, and pointed out that the bloody massacres by the Greek fascists were entirely in accordance with the instructions of Truman and Marshall.

　　希民主军正胜利进军
  　距离雅典仅九十公里
    美帝恐慌直接指挥伪军作战
    【新华社陕北二日电】希民主军继续胜利进军。据自由希腊电台二月二十五日广播：马科斯将军某部续向雅典挺进，于二月十三日晚，攻克了罗米利亚地区的列瓦第亚城的一部分（在雅典西北九十公里铁道线旁）。据雅典伪政府官方二月二十五日透露：民主军上周在摩里亚半岛各地积极进攻，二月二十一日，攻克西提昂城，以及帕特拉（半岛北端铁道线上）和卡拉马（半岛南端铁道线上）两大城的郊外许多村庄。在民主军不断打击下雅典伪政府之兵力已日益枯竭，日前反动政府已下令强迫征集十三岁到十八岁的少年充当炮灰。
    民主军的强大攻势和希腊伪政府的日暮途穷，使美帝大为焦急，一方面，杜鲁门在国会大叫：“帮助希腊政府对游击队作战”，另一方面，实行了更疯狂的武装干涉。美英军事使团与希伪政府最近会谈结果，决定希作战部队的全部指挥，由美英军事使团执行，而由美国负主责。同时美帝又急派范。佛力特赴希，代替勒维塞为军事使团团长。另据美援希使团团长格利斯伍德供认：目前“已有一八○名美高级军官直接指挥希军作战”。
    【新华社陕北二日电】纽约讯：美国人民纷起反对杜鲁门政府对希腊的武装干涉。上月十八日，曾有两百个反法西斯团体在此间希领事馆前举行大示威，抗议美国对希腊的武装干涉，并递交希领事馆备忘录一件，严斥希腊保皇法西斯分子反对民主人士的暴行，要求恢复希境公民的自由。美共工人日报力斥美国的武装干涉，助长了希腊的内战；并指出：希腊法西斯的血腥屠杀，完全是执行杜鲁门与马歇尔的训令。
