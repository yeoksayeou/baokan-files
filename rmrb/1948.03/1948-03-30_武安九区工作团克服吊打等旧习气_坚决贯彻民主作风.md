　　Wu'an Ninth District Work Group Overcomes Old Habits Like Torture
    Resolutely Implements Democratic Style
    [This Newspaper's Report] The main branch reporter reports: In the process of carrying out the "fill-in-the-blanks" rectification campaign in Wu'an Ninth District, the Central Bureau Work Group has abandoned old practices such as verbal abuse, torture, and detention. It has firmly implemented new practices like no beatings, no scolding, no detentions, focusing on practicalities, and reasoning, which has achieved significant results.

    Since the end of January, the Central Bureau Work Group has focused on Zhao Village and its seven nearby villages to create experiences in rectification, democracy, and "fill-in-the-blanks" movements, gradually expanding to villages like Shili Dian and Sanwang Village. According to investigations, this area has three characteristics: First, after the rent reduction and interest rate reduction in 1942, land reform, and three major "fill-in-the-blanks" movements, landlords and feudal rich peasants have been basically destroyed politically and economically. The difference in land ownership among peasants is not significant, with only a small portion of poor and hired peasants not yet completely liberated; Second, most of the Communist Party branches in each village are combat-effective, and the majority of Party members come from poor peasants, hired peasants, and new middle peasants. For example, in Zhao Village, 24 out of 35 Party members are poor and hired peasants. Although the amount of land acquired through improper means is proven to be small, a minority of bad Party members and bad cadres (approximately one-quarter to one-third) engaged in wrongdoing in the past, using coercion, beating and detaining people, and arbitrarily labeling people as spies, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the masses; Third, the masses are relatively aware and landlords and feudal rich peasants have not been sheltered, but a small number of bad elements and hooligans have been sheltered by Party members and cadres. Last year, when the "face washing and blackening" movement was launched, cadres immediately began "establishing merit and setting examples" as soon as the masses raised opinions, causing bad Party members and cadres to take the opportunity to retaliate against the masses, creating an even greater rift between cadres and the masses. Based on the above three characteristics, the work group decided on a working principle: first, rectify the Party, implement democracy, transform the style of Party members, and give the masses full democratic rights. Then, adopt the method of "taking from those who have more to give to those who have less, taking from the rich to supplement the poor, filling in the blanks, and moving a few instead of the majority, to solve the remaining land problems" (Central Bureau's February 1st instruction).

    Due to the long-term rift between cadres and the masses, the masses were full of complaints and grievances. Once mobilized, they easily developed radical emotions. These emotions are easily incited by a few people, leading to violent actions such as beating and detaining people. This is a crucial juncture in the rectification and democratic movement. If not handled well, the masses will either not be mobilized or it will cause blind retaliatory actions by the masses, damaging the entire movement. This bad style of detention, beating, and suppression, left over from feudal society, has not been cleared up in recent years and still has a profound impact on rural life. The majority of the masses originally did not agree with this, but when emotions are agitated, they often resort to it. If the leadership's thinking is not clear and lacks courage, even if they verbally say no, it is still unavoidable.

    From the beginning, the work group adopted a firm and clear approach, stating that it would only support the masses and not bad cadres or bad Party members. At the same time, it declared no beatings, no torture, no scolding, no detentions, no random tracing of roots, and no forced confessions, but rather focusing on practicalities, reasoning, and allowing rebuttal. This spirit was implemented in every aspect of the movement, enlightening the masses to realize that random beating, detention, and tracing were products of feudal society, completely eliminating its influence from the masses' minds, and gradually establishing a new style of democratic reasoning in rural life. However, this is a very important educational process. This struggle is not only reflected in the inconsistent leadership's approach with some of the incorrect thoughts of the masses (such as believing that "problems cannot be solved without beating" and even wanting to send bad cadres to the bottom of cliffs), but also in the tailism of some comrades within the work group (such as not enlightening and educating them beforehand, and then using the excuse of "not pouring cold water" when the masses have radical emotions, and even thinking that "it won't work without beating and detaining") which deviates from the principles of the Party. During this period, except for the Qingyansi work group which detained Party members and cadres with major errors at a public Party mass meeting when the masses were enraged (which was resolutely corrected by the work group leadership), Zhao Village and other villages consistently implemented the spirit of democratic reasoning from beginning to end. Facts have proven that the effect is very good. Even for Party members and cadres who made serious mistakes and faced great pressure from the masses, none of them ran away or had other accidents, even though they were so worried that they couldn't sleep at first (some comrades in the work group originally thought that problems would occur if these people were not detained). With the help of the Party and the masses, they finally recognized their mistakes and consciously requested and accepted punishment; and on the part of the masses, they also realized in the actual movement that the democratic reasoning method is good. Some people at the beginning always thought that "landlords cannot be dealt with without beating and torturing," and also thought that "Party members and cadres cannot be dealt with without beating and torturing," but later said: "Chairman Mao's method is good, and I am convinced." Now this new style has penetrated into the masses, such as "speaking practically" and "speaking the truth" when encountering things. A atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism has been established in mass organizations. This new atmosphere has further developed after the reorganization of farmers' associations and governments in various villages, with a large number of outstanding elements from the masses joining the leadership group.

### 武安九区工作团克服吊打等旧习气  坚决贯彻民主作风

　　武安九区工作团克服吊打等旧习气
    坚决贯彻民主作风
    【本报消息】总分社记者报导：中央局工作团在武安九区进行填补整党中，不要辱骂、吊打、扣押等旧作风，坚持贯彻不打、不骂、不扣、重实际、讲道理等新作风，已获显著成效。
    中央局工作团自一月底，以赵庄及其附近七个村为重点，创造整党、民主、填补运动经验，逐步向什里店、三王村等村庄开展。根据调查，这一带村庄有三个特点：一、经过四二年减租减息，土地改革，填平补齐三次大运动，地主与封建富农在政治上经济上基本已被摧垮，农民间土地占有差额不大，仅有小部分贫雇农尚未翻透身；二、各村共产支部大多是有战斗力，党员出身大多是贫雇农与新中农，如赵庄三十五个党员中，二十四个是贫雇农。多占土地果实证明为数虽不大、但因少数坏党员、坏干部（约四分之一至三分之一）过去为非作歹，强迫命令，打人扣人，乱加特务帽子，引起广大群众不满；三、群众觉悟较高，地主封建富农没有被包庇下来，但少数坏分子、流氓分子，被党员干部包庇下来。去年开展“洗脸擦黑”运动时，刚发动群众提意见，马上就给党员干部“立功表模”，致使坏党员干部乘机向群众报复，造成干群间更大的裂痕。根据以上三个特点，工作团决定工作方针：首先是整党，实行民主，改造党员的作风，给群众以充分的民主权利，然后采取“抽多补少，抽肥补瘦，填平补齐，动少数不动多数的办法，以解决遗留下的土地问题”（中央局二、一指示）。
    由于干群间长期存在着裂痕，群众满肚子牢骚、冤气，一经发动，便会产生偏激情绪。这种情绪极容易被少数人煽动，而产生打人、扣人等暴力行动。这是整党民主运动的重要关节，如果掌握不好，不是群众发动不起来，便会造成群众盲目的报复行动，使整个运动受到损害。这种封建社会遗留下来扣、打、压的坏作风，在数年来未经清算，至今在农村生活中仍有深刻的影响，大多数群众本来对此不赞成，但感情激动时往往又要采用，如果领导思想不明确，缺乏魄力，稍有动摇，就是口头上说不用，结果还是不可避免。
    工作团对此，一开始即采取坚定明确的方针，声明只给群众撑腰，不给坏干部坏党员撑腰，但同时声明，不打、不吊、不骂、不扣、不乱追根、不强迫坦白，而要讲实际，讲道理，允许辩驳。并将这一精神贯彻到运动各个环节中去，启发群众觉悟到乱打、乱扣、乱追是封建社会的产物，将其影响完全从群众思想中清除出去，使民主说理的新作风，在农村生活中逐渐建立起来。但这是一个很重要的教育过程，这种斗争不仅表现在群众某些不正确的思想（如认为“不打不能解决问题”，甚至要把坏干部送到崖底下去）与领导方针不一致，同时也表现在工作团内部某些同志的尾巴主义思想（如以前不启发教育，到群众有了偏激情绪又借口“不泼冷水”，甚至自己就认为“不打不扣不行”）与党的原则相分歧。在这一段工作过程中，除青烟寺工作组在公开党的群众大会上，曾经在群情激愤下，扣押过错误较大的党员干部外，（即为工作团领导上发觉，坚决予以纠正。）而赵庄等其他村，均自始至终贯彻了民主讲理这一精神。事实证明，效果很好，在党员干部方面，即使是错误很大，群众压力也很大，开始愁得睡不着觉的，也没有一个逃跑或发生其他意外事件（原来工作团某些同志认为这些人不扣起来就会发生问题）。在党与群众帮助下，终于认识了自己的错误，自觉地请求与接受处分；而在群众方面，也在实际运动中，认识民主说理方式就是好。有些人开头总认为“地主不打不吊都不行”，对党员干部也认为“非打非吊不行”，但后来却说：“毛主席的办法好，我算是信服了”。现在这种新作风已深入到群众中去，如遇事“讲实际”、“讲真理”，在群众组织中，建立了批评与自我批评的风气。此种新气象，在各村农会与政府改造后，大批群众中的优秀分子拥入领导集团，更形发展。
