【Taihang News】 Xu Laisong, the political director of Huiche Village in Huguan County, patiently explained the Outline Land Law, enabling the middle and poor peasants in the village to understand that the land would not undergo major changes, and they actively delivered manure to prepare for spring plowing. On the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the village summarized winter production by team and group, followed by a discussion on manure delivery work for the first lunar month. However, because everyone still misunderstood the Land Law as "redistribution of the enemy's property," middle peasants with more land said, "Land will be divided soon. Where should I deliver manure?" Poor and hired peasants with less land said, "Let's wait until the land is divided!" Most farmers also suggested, "We don't know which piece of land we'll be planting yet, so we can't deliver manure right now. Let's wait until it's divided!" At this time, Political Director Xu Laisong said, "The newspaper told us that the land of well-off middle peasants will be voluntarily drawn out through consultation. The village will also use the method of drawing from the more and compensating the less, drawing from the fertile and compensating the barren, to make adjustments. Besides, according to the actual situation in our village, the land issue has been largely resolved due to the rent and interest reduction and land reform movements in the past few years. Therefore, the land of most middle peasants will definitely not be touched this time. Everyone should quickly deliver manure, repair the land, and prepare for spring plowing. Don't misunderstand. Spring is early this year, so don't delay sowing." After hearing this, everyone felt it made sense. They then had another discussion and eliminated the misunderstanding of "disruptive redistribution," putting their minds at ease. They immediately formulated a manure delivery plan. Manure delivery began on the second day of the first lunar month. All fifty-seven laborers in the village, nine ox carts, and five donkeys were mobilized to deliver manure. After summarizing the work on the eighth night of the first lunar month, it was found that 4,970 loads of manure had been delivered in seven days, and the entire village would be able to complete the delivery before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month.

【Xingtai News】 Poor and hired peasants in Lanyang Village in the Fourth District are publicizing the Land Law, uniting with middle peasants, and engaging in production together. After the Lunar New Year, based on past experience, the poor and hired peasants were afraid that production would be delayed during the drawing and compensation phase. They also saw that some middle peasants were not very clear about the Land Law and were afraid that the land they were plowing would be divided to others. Based on these situations, they focused on organizing production while publicizing the Land Law. The Shi Guangjing group worked in the fields while discussing the Land Law. Middle peasant Chen Haolin said, "I don't know which piece of my land will be given to others. I'll give some land to others first, and then I can cultivate my own." The poor and hired peasants immediately calculated the account for him, saying, "You don't have much land, so you shouldn't give it to others." After a serious explanation, Chen Haolin's thinking was straightened out. Now the village proposes to combine production with welcoming the drawing and compensation. The village had eighty-five mu of sorghum stalks left unplowed from last year, five hundred and seventy mu of barren land uncultivated, and one thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven mu of land plowed but not harrowed. The entire village proposed that all this land be plowed and harrowed by the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, and the sorghum stalks be brought home. They also planned to plant eight hundred trees and have already planted four hundred. During the publicity, it was discovered that some people were spreading rumors, saying, "Even if things change, we'll still be planting their land." Others said, "Harrowing the land is worse than not harrowing it." These rumors were addressed and debunked during the publicity. All sixty cattle in the village are plowing the land. The enthusiasm of the middle and poor peasants is very high. Middle peasant Sui Chunni said, "In the past, we wouldn't plow the land before the Awakening of Insects, but that's all nonsense. Look how good it is this year. I'm even happier than when we planted cotton last year." (Song Shiqun, Chang Yan)

【Neiqiu News】 Dalei East Village in the Sixth District, on the third day after the New Year, used the winter school to publicize and study the Land Law, prevent landlords from sabotage, and prevent panic and non-production among the masses. They also discussed how to consolidate unity with the middle peasants and accelerate production. Everyone heard that the Land Law was about abolishing the feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land system and understood that the middle and poor peasants are one family and should unite and produce well. On the seventh and eighth days of the first lunar month, there was a little rain. The winter schools discussed spring plowing methods. The village has a total of three thousand six hundred mu of land, with over one thousand mu planted with wheat. There are a total of fifty-seven livestock of all sizes and one hundred and sixty-two people, old and young. The plan is to complete the task in three days. The next day, they started working in the fields. They held a meeting in the evening to discuss the work, and the next day they worked even harder. Everyone said that production should not be delayed in future land adjustments and various other tasks.

　　联系本村情况讲解土地法
  　消除误解着手春耕
    【太行消息】壶关回车村政治主任许来松同志，耐心解释土地法大纲，使全村中贫农知道了土地不会大变动，积极送粪准备春耕。该村在去年腊月二十七日，由各队各组总结了冬季生产，接着就讨论正月的送粪工作。可是因为大家还误解土地法是“打敌平分”，所以地多的中农就说：“马上就要平分土地，我该往那块地里送粪？”地少的贫雇说：“等平分土地后再送吧！”多数农民也提出：“还不知咱种那块地呀，眼下咱都没法送，等平分了再说吧！”这时政治主任许来松同志就说：“报纸上给咱们说过，富裕中农的土地，是用商量的办法自愿抽出一些。全村也是用抽多补少、抽肥补瘦的办法来调剂的。再说，根据咱村实际情况，因为好几年来已经过减租减息和土改运动，土地问题已大体上解决了，所以这次多数中农的土地一定不会动，大家要赶快送粪、修地，做春耕准备工作，不要错想，今年春浅，可不要误了养种。”大家听了这一番话，都觉很对，接着就又讨论了一回，才取消了“打乱平分”的误解，安下心来。马上就订送粪计划。从正月初二日就开始送粪，全村有劳力五十七个，牛车九辆，驴五头，都全部出动送粪。到初八黑夜总结了一下，七天中送粪四千九百七十担，在十五以前全村都能送完。
    【邢台消息】四区兰羊村贫雇，宣传土地法，团结中农，一道生产。过了阴历年，贫雇因根据过去经验，怕到抽补时，耽误了生产，又见有些中农，对土地法还不很清楚，怕自己耕耙的地，再分给人家。根据这些情况，他们就抓紧组织生产，同时宣传土地法，石光敬组在地里一面做活，一面讨论土地法，中农陈好林说：“到底我的地那块给人家，我也闹不清，现在先给别人些地，我也就能耕种了。”贫雇马上给他算帐说：“你的地并不多，不该给别人。”认真的解释后，打通陈好林思想。现这村提出结合生产迎接抽补。这村去年留下的活，有八十五亩花秸没刨，五百七十亩白地没耕，一千八百五十七亩地耕了没耢，全村提出阴历正月十五日这些地全耕完耢完，花秸也刨到家，并计划栽八百棵树，现已栽起四百棵。宣传中发现有人趁空造谣说：“变了天咱还种他们的地哩。”又说：“耢地还不如不耢。”这些谣言在宣传中都注意揭破了。这村六十头牛都在翻地，中贫农情绪很高，中农睢春妮说：“从前不过惊蛰不耕地，这都是胡说，看今年多好，比去年点花时还高兴。”（宋士群、昌言）
    【内邱消息】六区大垒东村，在年后的第三天，就在冬学宣传研究土地法，防止地主破坏和群众慌乱不生产现象，又讨论怎样能巩固的团结中农，加紧生产。大家听到土地法上说的是废除封建半封建的剥削的土地制度，了解中贫农是一家，要好好团结生产。初七、八天下了一点小雨，各冬学讨论春耕的办法，全村地一共三千六百亩，种了有一千多亩麦子，牲口大小共五十七头，人老少一百六十二口，计划三天可以完成任务。第二天开始下地干起来了，晚上开会讨论，到第二天干的更有劲，大家都说，以后无论在调剂土地和各样工作中，不能耽搁生产。
