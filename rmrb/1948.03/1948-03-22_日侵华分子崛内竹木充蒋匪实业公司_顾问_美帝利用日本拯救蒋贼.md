     US Imperialism Uses Japan to Save Chiang Kai-shek Bandit
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 15th] Hong Kong, March 12th dispatch: Local newspapers reveal that traitor Song Ziwen, acting on American orders, has appointed Japanese aggressor and former Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Horiuchi Takemiki, as “advisor” to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's state-run Guangdong Industrial Company. The report claims that Song Ziwen's need for Horiuchi is also related to trade between South China and Japan. It is said that Horiuchi was originally a "close friend" in Song Ziwen's traitorous trading arena.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th dispatch] Washington dispatch: US imperialism's conspiracy to foster Japan as an accomplice in aggression against China is being intensified. A US government industrial delegation, including Lucius D. Clay and other major financial magnates and endowed with "high authority," is scheduled to go to Tokyo on the 17th to confer with MacArthur and Marshall's chief aide, Kennan. The delegation is scheduled to stay in Japan for ten days, then go to Korea. According to a United Press dispatch on the 16th, the delegation's trip to Japan "is the first concrete step in the US policy of relaxing demands for reparations from Japan and actively supporting Japanese export industries and markets." Washington observers close to US officials also inadvertently revealed the secret when discussing Kennan and Clay's mission in Tokyo in private on the 17th. They said: Because the US authorities painfully feel that "the situation in China (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) is hopeless, they have turned to Japan, and the United States is now considering using its former enemy for its own defense"; they further revealed: "The US Department of the Army is quietly carrying out a movement of vital importance to China (Chiang Kai-shek bandit), that is, the plan to rebuild Japan, to make Japan self-sufficient, develop exports and industry." The hideous face of US imperialism, which is raising Japanese reactionaries to be enemies of the Eastern people, is now more thoroughly exposed.

      日侵华分子崛内竹木　充蒋匪实业公司“顾问”
     美帝利用日本拯救蒋贼
    【新华社陕北十五日电】香港十二日讯：此间报纸消息披露：卖国贼宋子文已依照美国命令，任命日本侵华分子前日本驻沪总领事崛内竹木为蒋匪国营广东实业公司的“顾问”。消息称：宋子文之需要崛内，和华南与日本之间的贸易亦有关系。据称，崛内原来就是宋匪子文卖国交易场上的“密友”。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】华盛顿讯：美帝扶植日本作为侵华帮凶的阴谋活动正加紧进行中。包括陆次德莱柏及其他大财阀而赋有“高度权力”的美政府工业代表团，已定于十七日赴东京，与麦克阿瑟及马歇尔主要助手凯南会商。该代表团预定留日十天，然后赴朝鲜。据合众社十六日电供认：此次代表团的赴日，“乃是美国放松对日赔偿要求的政策及积极扶植日本输出工业和市场的首次具体步骤”。接近美官方的华府观察家们，十七日在密谈凯南和德莱柏在东京的使命时，亦在不知不觉中泄漏了天机。他们说：由于美当局痛感“中国（蒋贼）的形势毫无希望，于是就转而打日本的主意，美国现正考虑利用它前敌国作为自己国防之用”；他们进一步透露：“美陆军部正静悄悄地在进行一个对中国（蒋贼）有切身重要性的运动，那就是重建日本计划，要使日本自给自足，发展输出和工业”。美帝豢养日本反动派与东方人民为敌的狰狞面目，至此更彻底暴露。
