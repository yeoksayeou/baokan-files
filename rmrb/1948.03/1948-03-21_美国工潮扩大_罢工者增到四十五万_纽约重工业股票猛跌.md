Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 19th: New York dispatch: As of the morning of the 17th, the total number of American workers on strike had reached over 450,000 and was still expanding. According to a United Press survey, 350,000 of the Mine Workers Union's 400,000 workers were on strike, and almost all of the 100,000 meatpacking workers were on strike. The miners' strike has affected 14 states, and daily coal production losses will reach 1.75 million tons. In addition, there are over 5,000 printing workers on strike, and Minneapolis school teachers have been on strike for 22 days. The latter has forced the closure of 92 public schools in the city, leaving 75,000 students out of school. This large-scale strike has broken the record of the 450,000-person strike last July, and it is the largest since the first major strike after the war (early 1946).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 19th: New York dispatch: The result of American capitalists forcibly implementing rationalized production after the war has caused large numbers of workers, especially middle-aged workers, to suffer unemployment, and the number of factory accidents has greatly increased. For example, the railway sector is now using machines to repair rails, each of which can replace the work of 144 people, which will result in the unemployment of 430,000 railway workers. According to the Director of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, "The result of implementing this system is that the first to be sacrificed are workers over 45 years old, who account for about one-third of the country's industrial workers, and it causes an alarming degree of physical exhaustion for workers, making them generally five years older than their actual age." At the same time, due to the lack of safety devices, 2,056,000 factory accidents occurred in 1947, including 16,500 fatal incidents, leaving 92,000 workers permanently disabled.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 19th: New York dispatch: The stock market here experienced a sharp drop on the 17th, with a loss of value of up to one billion dollars. It is worth noting that heavy industry and railway stocks led the sell-off this time. Youngstown Steel's stock plummeted 5 and 5/8 points to 66 and 7/8 points. Bethlehem and US Steel stocks both fell more than one point. Santa Fe Railway Company's stock even fell 2 and 3/4 points to 92 and 1/2 points. After many basic industries in the United States have reached a relatively "over-produced" saturation point, the decline in heavy industry stocks shows another new development in the unstable American economic situation.

　　美国工潮扩大
  　罢工者增到四十五万
  　纽约重工业股票猛跌
    【新华社陕北十九日电】纽约讯：美国工人的大罢工，迄十七日晨为止，总数已达四十五万余人，且仍在扩大中。据合众社调查，矿工联合会四十万工人中，已有三十五万人罢工，肉类包装工人十万人几全部罢工。矿工的罢工已波及十四州，每日损失煤产将达一百七十五万吨。其他尚有五千余人的印刷工人罢工，及已坚持二十二日的明尼亚波利学校教员的罢教。后者已使该城九十二所公立学校关门，七万五千名学生失学。此次大罢工已打破去年七月四十五万人罢工的纪录，为战后第一次（四六年初）大罢工以来规模最大的一次。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】纽约讯：战后美国资本家强行生产合理化的结果，使大量工人特别是中年工人遭受失业，工厂出事次数大增。例如现铁路方面已使用修理铁轨的机器，每架可代替一四四人工作，结果势将有四十三万铁路工人失业。据美劳工统计局局长供认：“实施这种制度的结果，首先被牺牲的，是占全国产业工人约三分之一的四十五岁以上的工人。并使工人体力耗损到可惊的程度，使一般工人都变得较其实际年龄老五岁”。同时，由于缺乏安全装置，一九四七年便发生两百零五万六千件工厂出事事件，其中有一万六千五百致命事件，使九万二千工人终身残废。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】纽约讯：此间证券市场于十七日发生猛跌，损失价值达十亿元。值得重视的，这次重工业与铁路股票领头抛售。杨斯通钢公司的股票剧跌了一又八分之五点至六十六又八分之七点。伯利恒与美国钢公司的股票均下跌一点以上。圣大菲铁路公司股票竟跌落二又四分之三点至九十二又二分之一点。在美国许多基本工业已达相对“生产过剩”的饱和点之后，重工业股票的跌价，显示美国不稳经济形势中的又一新发展。
