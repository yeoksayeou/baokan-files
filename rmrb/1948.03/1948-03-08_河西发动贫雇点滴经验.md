Hebei Peasants’ Little Experiences in Mobilizing Poor and Hired Peasants

The Poor Peasants' League of Hexi Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, was formally established on February 17. During this period, some experiences were gained in visiting and mobilizing poor and hired peasants:

Poor and oppressed peasants don't speak up
Polite and courteous, there's nothing to talk about
In the beginning, the first group we visited consisted of about eight or nine people, mostly long-term laborers, honest and reliable, lacking clothing and food, living in dilapidated houses with little property, some were elderly, weak, widowed and orphaned. These honest, suffering people were not valued in the village, and they themselves felt, "We are suffering people, without ability, we can't even say a word, we only know how to suffer, we don't know anything about the village affairs." At this time, there were eight or nine comrades working on visiting the poor and hired peasants, almost one for each. We visited their homes during the day and gathered them together for small meetings in the evening, encouraging them to pour out their grievances, talk about their concerns, and offer suggestions. At the same time, we repeatedly expressed our attitude to them, determined not to be like "washing faces and smearing them black." But seven or eight days passed, and they still couldn't get their spirits up. When we talked about letting the poor and hired peasants be the masters, they would say, "We can't do it, we can't speak well and we can't read, let others do it!" When meetings were held, eight or nine poor and hired peasants would sit face to face with eight or nine working comrades. Talking back and forth, they always circled around "Can we be the masters, dare we make suggestions," unable to break through their thinking. When we visited their homes individually, we were invited to sit on the kang and warm ourselves by the fire. We were polite to each other, almost like we were treating the "working staff" of the past. We went there treating them as working objects to find materials to be mobilized, and they did not treat us as their own people, not talking about their true feelings. After talking a few times and understanding some superficial materials, we felt that we had nothing to say except to tell them some general principles, and the work did not progress much, unable to go deep. The comrades felt that they had nothing to rely on and felt depressed.

Poor and oppressed peasants connect and network
More people, things are easier to handle
After review, it was found that the number of poor and hired peasants was too small, they felt that they were few and weak, and they also requested to expand the connection. In addition to the work team comrades' investigation and visits, the poor and hired peasants who had been found also went down to connect and network. Then, the class was divided by lane, and the circle of poor and hired peasants expanded from eight or nine households to eleven households. But at this time, the work team still believed in and relied on the first few people the most. When discussing the progress of the work, we only called these few people in a few times, and they called ten or more people. Some people we didn't believe in suggested that they consider it, and they said it didn't matter, they weren't afraid. For example, Zhang ××, we felt that this person did not work hard, some people said that he was a rogue, and at the same time, in his first conversation with him, he expressed that he wanted to be a cadre, so we thought he was an "ambitious person" and made it clear to Zhang Beifang and others that we should not look for him first, and put him aside. We were afraid that impure elements would be mixed in, disrupt the mass ranks, or even seize the leadership in the future, hindering the rise of honest peasants, while the masses wanted to find more people, more people, more courage, things would be easier to handle. In fact, we ignored the demands of the masses, closed the door, and did not let go.

Later, due to the expansion of the team, and at the same time, everything was passed through them in the work, the work steps were discussed by them, and they were allowed to move freely among the masses as much as possible. At the same time, combined with party rectification, the cadres' attitude towards the masses was also different from the past on the surface. In these specific actions, their confidence was gradually improved, realizing that this was indeed different from the time of "washing faces and smearing them black." When their morale was raised, they often held meetings until midnight and still did not sleep. Jia Zhengfang, a poor peasant with the greatest suffering and higher class consciousness discovered after the class division, said to everyone: "As long as we are public-minded and work for the people, what are we afraid of if we can't read, we can't find the secretary!"

Actively promote democracy
Morale generally improved
Abstract conditions don't work
Starting from the concrete is the way to go
At the Poor Peasants' League Congress
Examine your own shortcomings

Immediately after the old year, the party was made public, and preparations were started for the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League. On the afternoon of the 11th, a meeting of poor and hired peasants was held to elect the initiators of the Poor Peasants' League. Among the eleven initiators, except for two deposed cadres with retaliatory emotions, all were honest peasants who had been working for many years. Among the eleven people, two were selected to prepare how to speak to everyone at the Peasant Association, and how to call on everyone to join the Poor Peasants' League; what are the benefits of joining the Poor Peasants' League, some said that after the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, we should work for the poor and let the poor speak, and lead everyone to produce. This one said and that one added, it was very noisy and excited. That night, the Peasant Association was held, the list of party members was announced, and the initiators of the Poor Peasants' League also met with the masses and spoke. At this time, the masses began to complain. The next day, a mass meeting of the whole village was held to give opinions to party members and cadres, representatives were elected, and they participated in the branch meeting, and the masses' opinions were put forward to the party members face to face. The masses felt that they had vented a breath, and their morale gradually increased generally. And the poor peasants' demand for being the masters of their own affairs became increasingly clear, and their ability to handle affairs, creativity and enthusiasm were gradually improved and strengthened with the movement. The whole village was divided into classes, and the scope of poor peasants was expanded again to 39 households. Then the initiators actively connected with the members. When the work team comrades helped them study the conditions for members, they asked them to set down a few standards first, but they did not set them in general, but started from specific people and specific households. As a result, they naturally set general conditions from specific people, and then used the conditions to measure each other to decide whether they could be absorbed. For example, when ××× was mentioned because he had pretended to be a military dependent and let the masses cultivate for him for three or four years, everyone said that this person was self-seeking and could not be wanted, so "self-seeking" was not wanted, and it became a condition. Speaking of ××, everyone said that he was a bit lazy and not progressive, so long-term labor also became a condition. This proves that our set of starting from concepts, taking dead boxes and putting them on living things, is completely incompatible with the masses' way of thinking, and cannot be accepted by the masses. At the beginning of the review, some people showed that they were afraid to let go, and they were unwilling to take those with a little minor problem. After repeated discussions, the scale was relaxed. Jia Zhengfang vividly made an analogy and said: "It's like buying a bowl, it rings now, who knows when it will break, just pick it now, and talk about it when it breaks in the future." On the night after the connection, they urgently demanded the immediate establishment of the Poor Peasants' League. The masses said that this year the spring is shallow, in the past manure was sent after the fifth day of the first month, this year they are afraid of disrupting the division, and they have not moved yet, we must quickly organize, go to the ground during the day, hold meetings at night, and quickly adjust the land, so as not to delay the spring plowing. Because the masses' morale has risen, it was decided to follow their opinions and decided to establish the Poor Peasants' League. The founding conference was presided over by the presidium (three people) selected from the initiators. The atmosphere at the conference was very warm. Several masses voluntarily stood up and spoke, saying that this was everyone's business, and we could not rely on the leaders alone, we must all help to make suggestions, and come as soon as we are called to the meeting. … … When conducting self-criticism, the young Zhang Laizi, because of his relationship with a woman before marriage, his wife often makes trouble now, and he hurriedly stood up to reflect, saying that he has changed and will never commit it again in the future. Zhang Beifang, one of the chairmen, also directly reviewed to everyone that he had wanted to date a landlord's wife and gave her noodles and meat, and guaranteed that he would not do so again in the future. At the same time, the masses tore their faces and criticized the two eloquent people among the initiators, sharply pointing out that Jia ×× had oppressed the masses when he was the village chief. As a result, everyone had a further understanding of them in the election, one was not even nominated as a candidate, and the other was nominated as a candidate but received very few votes, proving that the work team comrades' worries in advance were some disbelief in the masses and superfluous worries. The election results were that all five committee members were recognized by everyone as honest, upright, and poor people who were suffering people.

Work review:
Loose first, then tight, not in-depth
Took detours and left loopholes

Generally speaking, this period of work showed that it was loose first and then tight, the time for visiting the poor and hired peasants was long and not in-depth, the poor and hired peasants gradually improved their confidence and trusted us in the continuous concrete actions. The process of preparing for the Poor Peasants' League in the later stage was very tight, and some places were hasty and rushed, and the brewing was not enough. But the result was that the election was generally very good when the Poor Peasants' League was established, and the morale of the poor and hired peasants was also very high. The main reason we believe is that: in the whole work process, although we also felt depressed, we always relied on upright and honest peasants, and we were unswervingly paying attention to those who could speak and talk a little. After those who can speak and talk well were connected, we began to be vigilant. When some of the masses wanted to rely on them, we repeatedly enlightened the masses not to only look at those who can speak and talk well. Coupled with the masses' simple understanding of them, the masses naturally took an appropriate attitude towards them. In the previous stage, when we wanted to give opinions to cadres and party members, and the masses' ability to handle affairs and political experience were still very immature, we could absorb them. Because they knew the bottom line of the village affairs, and they could give opinions to the cadres, but when we really wanted to establish an organization to be the masters of our own affairs and work for the masses, the poor and hired peasants criticized them, saying that they were unreliable, and naturally brushed them out of the core. On this issue, the masses have a simple understanding, but we must often improve education so that we do not have deviations.

But in the whole work process, how to follow the mass line, we took a lot of detours and made a lot of deviations:

When visiting the poor and hired peasants, we did not first go deep to understand them, and truly closely combine with them from the ideological and emotional point of view, but treated them as working objects to mobilize and find materials. Therefore, we were unwilling to talk more when we saw women, because they did not know the village affairs. For the general poor and hired peasants, we also became discouraged and depressed when we could not find problems, and we became indifferent to those who had a little pimple in their minds, a little small problem, and the masses had a little small opinion. For example, Zhao Quantang was afraid of joining the army and wanted to go out, and his initial performance was not active, and the person who visited him was a little impatient. The masses reflected a little opinion on the blacksmith Zhang Xianbao, saying that he ate well and was not frugal, and we also became indifferent and did not go to him for a long time. At the same time, we found that connecting the poor and hired peasants did not pass through the masses, but used our own certain frame to deduct, and we lightly believed in one-sided materials. For example, the current chairman of the Poor Peasants' League, Jia Zhengfang, in the beginning, because someone said that his time was enough, no one went to talk to him, and for a long time, this poor peasant with the deepest suffering and higher class consciousness was isolated outside the circle. It was not until after the initial class division that we heard a little about his situation from the cadres that we discovered our past one-sided subjectivism. At the same time, we also neglected the mobilization of the poor and hired peasants. For a long time, we entangled these few people who we thought were backbones, and we only focused on these few people when looking at problems. For example, when the Poor Peasants' League was established, everyone's ideological concerns were that we only saw that there were still initiators who were influenced by confused ideas, and we regarded these as the situation of the masses, and we did not dare to let go of the mobilization.

In the whole work style, we sometimes acted as a substitute, and sometimes we followed the masses, and we did not strengthen ideological education from specific problems. For example, we did not do enough to mobilize women below, and we blindly emphasized to elect women during the election. Even when helping to write ballots, we reminded people to write women, hindering the masses from truly exercising democratic power. And on some issues, we unconditionally echoed the masses, resulting in loopholes in the work.

　　河西发动贫雇点滴经验    　  　
    武安九区河西村贫农团于二月十七日正式成立，在这一段工作中对访问发动贫雇，也摸索到一些经验：
    贫苦农民不发言
    客客气气没啥谈
    开始，先访贫雇，首先找到的第一批，约有八、九个人，多是长年劳动、老实可靠的、缺衣缺食没房住少浮财的窟窿户，有些是老弱孤寡。这一伙老实的受苦汉，在村上是没人看重的，自己也觉得“咱是受苦人，没本事，连句话也不会说，只知道受，村上事啥也不摸”。这时，我们访贫雇的工作同志有八、九个，差不多可以一个找一个，白天到家里访问，晚上把几个人集合在一起开小会，启发他们诉苦、谈心事、提意见，同时也向他们一再表示态度，决不象洗脸擦黑那样。可是七、八天过去了，他们依然鼓不起劲来，一说叫贫雇当家，就说“咱不照（不行的意思），不会说话也不识字，还是叫人家干吧！”开起会来，八九个贫雇，八九个工作同志对面坐下，谈来谈去，总是绕着“能不能当家，敢不敢提意见”打圈子，突不破他们的思想。到家里个别访问，一进家叫坐炕上、烤火，彼此之间客客气气，和对待过去“工作员”差不多。我们去是把人家当成找材料被发动的工作对象，人家对我们也不当自己人，不谈真心话。谈过几次了解了一些表面材料后，见了面除了向人家讲讲大道理就感到无话可说，工作进展不大，无法深入，同志们则无所依靠，感到苦闷。
    贫雇活动串连
    人多事情好办
    经过检讨，又发现贫雇人数太少，他们感到人少势孤，也要求扩大串连。除工作组同志调查访问外，已发现的贫雇也下去串连活动，接着又分闾划阶级，贫雇圈子才由八九户扩大到十一户。但在这时，工作组最相信和依托的仍是最初几个人。商量工作的进行时，有几次我们只叫他们几个人来，而他们则一叫就是十来个人。有些我们不相信的人提出叫他们考虑，他们说没啥，不怕。如张××，我们觉得这个人不好好劳动，有人说他流氓，同时在和他初次谈话中间，他表示想当干部，我们就认为是“野心家”，就明白向张北方等提出先不要找他来，搁搁再说。我们是怕混进了不纯分子，搅乱群众阵营，甚或将来夺去领导权，妨碍老实农民的抬头，而群众则是想多找些人，人多胆子大，事就好办。实际上是我们忽视群众要求，关门、不放手。
    以后由于队伍的扩大，同时在工作中事事通过他们，工作步骤经过他们讨论，尽量放手让他们在群众中活动，同时结合整党，干部对群众态度在表面上也和过去不同了，在这些具体行动中他们的信心才逐步提高，认识到这次确是和洗脸擦黑时不同。情绪提高了，常常开会开到半夜还不睡觉，划阶级后才发现的受苦最大阶级觉悟较高的贫农贾正方就给大家说：“咱只要心公为老百姓办事，不识字怕啥，不会找书记！”
    积极发扬民主
    情绪普遍提高
    抽象订条件不照
    从具体出发才行
    贫农团大会上
    检查自己缺点
    旧年过后，立即公开党，并着手筹备贫农团的成立。十一日下午贫雇农开会，选举贫农团发起人，十一个发起人中除了两个带有报复情绪的下台干部外，全是长年劳动的老实农民。十一个人中又选出两个人准备在农会上怎样对大家讲话，怎样号召大家加入贫农团；加入贫农团有啥好处，有的说贫农团成立后要给穷人办事叫穷人说话，领导大家生产。这个说了那个又补充，闹哄哄的非常兴奋。当天晚上召开农会，公布了党员名单，贫农团发起人也和群众见了面讲了话。这时群众开始圪嚷起来，第二天全村群众大会，给党员干部提意见，选了代表，参加了支部会，把群众意见当面给党员提出，群众认为这是出了一口气，情绪普遍的渐趋高涨。而贫农中当家作主的要求日益明确，他们的办事能力创造性和积极性也随着运动而逐步提高加强。全村划了阶级，贫农范围再次扩大到卅九户。接着发起人便积极串连团员。工作组同志帮助他们研究团员条件时，要他们先定下几条标准，但他们却不是一般的订，而是从具体人具体户出发，结果很自然的从具体的人上订出一般条件，再拿条件相互衡量，决定能不能吸收。比如提到×××因为他曾混充抗属，让群众替他代耕了三、四年，大家说这人自谋自利不能要，于是“自谋自利”的不要，就成立一个条件。说到××，大家说他有点好吃懒做不长进，于是长年劳动就也成为一个条件。证明我们那一套从概念出发，是拿死框子往活的事物头上套，是完全不合乎群众的思想方法，而不能为群众接受的。审查开始，有些人表现不敢放手，稍有一点小毛病的就不愿要，后经反复讨论，才放宽尺度。贾正方生动的打了比喻说：“好比买碗，这会敲着叮叮当当，谁可知道它那会破，这会只管挑拣，将来破了再说。”就在当晚串连过后，他们就迫切要求立即成立贫农团。群众说今年春浅，往年破五后就送粪，今年怕打乱平分都还不动，一定得赶快组织起来，白天上地，夜里开会，赶快调剂好地亩，免得耽误春耕。因为群众情绪已经起来，就决定按照他们的意见，决定成立贫农团。成立大会，是由发起人中选出主席团（三人）主持，会场情绪很热烈，几个群众自动起来讲话，说这次是大家的事，不能光靠领头的人干，一定得大家一齐帮助出主意，开会一叫就来。………在进行自我批评时，年轻的张来子因为结婚前有男女关系，现在老婆还常给闹架，赶忙就站起来反省，说已经改了，以后也决不再犯。主席之一张北方也直接的向大家检讨了他曾经想和一个地主老婆对象，而给人家送面送肉，保证以后不再这样。同时群众也撕开面皮，对发起人中的两个能说会道的人作了批评，尖锐的指出贾××当村长时，曾欺压群众。使得选举中大家对他们有进一步的认识，一个连候选人也没提上，一个提了候选人而得票也很少，证明了事先工作组同志的顾虑，是有些不相信群众和多余的担心。选举结果五个委员全是大家公认为老实的、正派的和穷人一心的受苦人。
    工作检讨：
    先松后紧不深入
  　走了弯路留漏洞
    总的说来，这一段工作表现出先松后紧，访贫雇时间拖得长而不深入，贫雇是在不断的具体行动中逐渐提高信心信任我们的，后一阶段筹备贫农团过程，则工作进程赶得很紧，某些地方草率匆忙，酝酿不够。但结果在贫农团成立时，选举一般很好，贫雇情绪也很高，主要原因我们认为在于：在整个工作过程中，虽也感到苦闷，但始终依靠正派的老实农民，不看重能说会道一点是坚定不移的。对能说会道的串连进来以后，就开始警惕，在部分群众想依靠他们时，仍再三启发群众不要只看能说会道，加上群众对他们的朴素了解，就很自然地使群众对他们采取了适当的态度。前一阶段，要给干部党员提意见，群众办事能力政治经验还很不纯熟时，可以吸收他们。因为他们对村上事摸底，能给干部提意见，但在真正要成立组织当家作主给群众办事时，贫雇就批评了他们，说明他们是不可靠的，很自然的把他们从核心中刷了出去。在这一问题上，群众有朴素的认识，但还必须我们经常提高教育，才能不发生偏向。
    但在整个工作过程中，怎样走群众路线，是走了不少弯路，发生不少偏向的：
    访贫雇时，不是首先深入了解他们，真正从思想感情上和他们紧密结合，而是把他们当作工作对象去发动去找材料。因之见了妇女就不愿多谈，因为她们不知道村里事。对一般贫雇也是发现不了问题时就泄气苦闷，对思想上有圪塔、有点把小毛病，群众有点小意见的也就冷淡起来。如赵全堂怕参军想出去，开头表现不积极，访问他的人就有点不耐烦。铁匠张献宝，群众反映了他一点意见说他吃的好不俭省，我们也就冷淡好久不去找人家。同时发现串连贫雇不通过群众，而是以自己一定的框子去扣，并轻信片面材料。比如现在的贫农团主席贾正方，在最初因为有人说过一句他时光够过了，就没一个人去和他谈过，长时期的把这个受苦最深阶级觉悟较高的贫农隔在圈子外面。直到初划阶级后，从干部口中听说了他一点情况，才发现了过去我们的片面主观。同时又忽略了对贫雇群众的发动。长时期的纠缠住这几个我们自以为是骨干的人，看问题也只着眼在这几个人身上。如成立贫农团时大家思想上的顾虑，就是只看到发起人中还有受糊涂思想影响的，就把这些当成群众的情形，而不敢放手发动。
    在整个工作作风方面，则时而包办代替，时而又做群众尾巴，不从具体问题上加强思想教育。比如在下面发动妇女不够，选举时一味强调要选上妇女。甚至在帮写选票时还提醒人家叫写妇女，妨碍了群众真正使用民主权力。而在有些问题上则无原则的附和群众，致工作上留下漏洞。
