　　Communications and Exchanges
  　No. 16
    Since last month, this newspaper has successively published news and work experiences about the visits to poor peasants and hired laborers and the reorganization of teams in different types of villages such as Zhao Village and Tian Er Zhuang in the Ninth District of Wu'an, Taihang. Recently, we have continuously received letters from working comrades in Taihang, Jinnan, and other places, asking about the work characteristics of these villages and proposing discussions. Some comrades have also raised questions requesting supplementary reports. We believe that this realistic research spirit is very good. The purpose of publishing these "Work Communications" and "Work Research" is to enable comrades participating in land reform work in various places to exchange work experiences and exchange work opinions. We also welcome other comrades to have different opinions and start discussions with each other. If you have any questions or opinions about the news reports published in the newspaper, please write to us at any time. In addition, because different types of regions have their own different situations and different working methods, we hope that comrades and correspondents participating in the redistribution and compensation work should make specific reports according to the characteristics of their working areas and the different ways of starting work when reporting on the work in their areas.

　　通讯往来
  　第十六号
    本报自上月陆续发表太行武安九区赵庄、田二庄等不同类型村访问贫雇，整顿队伍的新闻和工作经验，最近连续接到太行、冀南各地工作同志来信，问这些村庄工作特点，提出商讨意见，有的同志还提出问题要求作补充报导。我们认为这种实事求是的研究精神是很好的。我们发表这些“工作通讯”“工作研究”的目的：原是为了使各地参加土改工作同志们交流工作经验，交换工作意见。同时也欢迎别的同志有不同的意见，互相展开讨论。如对报上登的新闻通讯有疑问，有意见，务请随时写给我们。此外，因不同类型地区，各有自己不同的情况和不同的工作作法，所以希望参加平分抽补工作的同志和通讯员同志：在报导自己地区工作时，应该按照自己工作地区的特点，和工作入手的不同方式作具体报导。
