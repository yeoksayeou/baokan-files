Xinhua News Agency, Frontline in Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 19th: The frontline headquarters has issued a communique, announcing the operational process and main results of the Luoyang Campaign: "To coordinate with the operations in the Northwest theater and liberate the people of Western Henan, a portion of our troops advanced to the central section of the Longhai Railway between Zhengzhou and Tongguan earlier this month, launching the Luoyang Liberation Campaign offensive. On the 8th, we captured Yanshi and Xin'an, cutting off the Longhai Railway. On the 9th, we continued to capture Mianchi. On the 8th and 9th, we also successively captured dozens of important towns and villages such as Baisha, Longmen, Pengpo, Heishiguan, Baimasi, Xiangzhuang, Luzhuang, Hengshui, Gushui, Cijian, and Yinghao, clearing the enemy within a hundred li radius around Luoyang, completing the total encirclement of Luoyang. At dusk on the 9th, we began attacking the east and west railway stations, the east, west, and north gates, and the Western Industrial District (Xigong). We captured the railway station that night. At dawn on the 10th, we continued to capture Xigong and mostly eliminated the enemy at the east and north gates. At 4 PM, we shifted our attack to the south gate. On the afternoon of the 11th, after an hour of fierce fighting, we captured the Zhougong Temple, an important enemy stronghold west of the city. By this point, our army had mostly eliminated the enemy at the four gates, and at dusk, we launched a fierce attack on the county seat. Our troops broke through dozens of enemy defense works and two city gates at the east gate, first entering the city at 10 PM that night, repelling several enemy counterattacks. Our strong follow-up troops poured into the east gate, attacking fiercely to the north, west, and south along the streets and city walls. The north gate and the southwest gates were also breached by our forces on the morning of the 12th and at dusk, respectively. Inside the city, our army continuously crushed countless isolated strongholds, group bunker fortifications, and underground tunnel defenses, fighting fiercely until noon on the 12th, annihilating over ten thousand enemies and controlling most of the city streets. The enemy's 206th Division Commander Qiu Xingxiang then gathered the remnants of over five thousand men and concentrated artillery, retreating to the headquarters in the northwest corner of the city (the address of the Heluo Middle School), relying on solid and complex fortifications, making a desperate stand, attempting to delay their annihilation. At 5:30 PM on the evening of the 14th, our army launched a general attack on the enemy headquarters. With the strong cooperation of artillery units, after three hours of fierce fighting, we completely destroyed the enemy headquarters building and group bunkers and other fortifications, completely capturing the enemy headquarters at 8:30 PM. At the same time, the enemy at the Jiulongtai in the east gate surrendered to us, and the remaining enemy at the electric light factory west of the city was also eliminated. The ancient capital of Luoyang was thus completely liberated. According to preliminary statistics, in this battle, we completely annihilated the Chiang bandit's direct lineage Youth Army 206th Division headquarters, two brigade headquarters, and the first, second, and third regiments of the first brigade, the fourth and sixth regiments of the second brigade, a total of five regiments, as well as two companies of the second battalion of the bandit Central Artillery 8th Regiment, the fifth company of the second battalion of the 10th Regiment, the tenth company of the fourth battalion of the 51st Regiment, and the bandit Military Service Supervision Department's 35th Sub-department, the 94th Rear Hospital, the 5th Independent Motor Vehicle Battalion, the Luoyang Military Police, the Luoyang Air Station, the Henan Province 10th Administrative Commissioner's Office, the Luoyang County Government, the Self-Defense Brigade, and other units, totaling over 18,000 people. We captured alive Qiu Xingxiang, commander of the 206th Division and commander of the Luoyang Garrison, Deputy Chief of Staff Fu Shaoji, First Brigade Commander Zhao Yunfei, First Regiment Commander Long Zhangduo, Deputy Regiment Commander Zhou Zhilu, Regiment Adjutant Bin Hongchun, Third Regiment Commander Cai Xiangcheng, Deputy Regiment Commander Wu Liangzuo, Sixth Regiment Commander Fang Jinglin, Commissioner Liu Huandong, County Magistrate Guo Xianfang, and over 15,000 others. The main spoils included three 10.5 cm caliber US-made howitzers, six field guns, ten anti-tank guns, three chemical mortars, two flamethrowers, four rocket launchers, and a large amount of other weapons, ammunition, and military supplies."
