(Our Report) Shili Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, completed its initial class classification after three days on March 6th, and posted the first announcement on the 7th. This classification was conducted according to the new regulations, based on the relations of production and the possession of means of production, using the method of self-declaration, public discussion, full democracy, and three public announcements to finalize the classifications. A total of 330 households participated, resulting in the classification of: 121 poor peasant households, 2 hired laborer households, 2 worker households, 2 artisan households, 98 new middle peasant households, and 80 middle peasant households. 25 households were undecided, including 15 where there were both poor peasant and new middle peasant opinions, 4 with poor peasant, new middle peasant, and middle peasant opinions, and 6 with new middle peasant and middle peasant opinions. Six households did not participate because they were not at home. Those who were previously designated as targets for struggle (first, second, and third class) were temporarily excluded and will be classified later. Individuals who disagreed with their own or others' assigned status were noted on the announcement. The masses took this matter very seriously, and the work team fully respected the opinions of the masses, preserving any dissenting views.

Prior to the classification, the work team studied the relevant documents, clarified the standards for classifying each class, and held separate study sessions with already-connected poor peasants and hired laborers, researching specific local conditions. This ensured that both the work team and the poor peasant/hired laborer backbone understood the classification standards. Some groups held meetings of household representatives.

　　　　Studying Documents and Mastering Policies　Researching in Light of Actual Conditions

After explaining the conditions, the team tentatively classified a few people, then explained the classification method: self-declaration, public discussion, and three announcements. Individuals stated their conditions, declared their class status, and then the masses publicly discussed. Any disagreements were written on the announcement, regardless of the number of different opinions. Further discussion followed, leading to a second announcement. Finally, everyone in the village could participate in the discussion, until complete agreement was reached. If individuals still disagreed after three announcements, they could appeal to the People's Court. In short, no one should be wronged. The following points were emphasized during classification: (1) Be honest and state the facts. (2) Different opinions should be expressed rationally, with debate allowed, but no fighting. (3) Break through personal considerations and avoid protectionism. (4) No settling personal scores. It was announced that: 1. The work team had no authority to determine anyone's class status; work team members only acted as guides to clarify the conditions. 2. Classification and land distribution were separate matters; being classified as a poor peasant did not guarantee land, and middle peasants might also receive land. Poor peasants who had received extra fruits had to return them.

On March 4th, classification began in the ninth group (Zhaishang). Before the classification, the work team emphasized the importance of the matter. The team explained the conditions, methods, and rules, emphasizing the conditions repeatedly to ensure the masses understood the standards. After discussion and clarification of questions, it was announced: "Those who are clear about their status may begin self-declaration!"

　　　　Clarifying Standards First at the Meeting　Starting After Sufficient Discussion

Fu Lirong stood up: "Let me start! Two years ago, I had 8.1 mu of land. Last spring, the farmers' association added 1.3 mu, so I now have 9.4 mu. I have no livestock. I have a hoe, shovel, and ＠, but no large farm tools (plow, harrow, seed drill). I have enough fertilizer for four mu of land, and I don't lack seeds. There are three people in my family, and I'm the only one who counts as labor. My grain harvest isn't enough to cover expenses, so I have to do odd jobs to supplement my income. The planned yield is over seven shi; two years ago, I harvested a total of three shi of millet and one shi of corn, for a total of four shi and seven dou of coarse grain. I think my life is okay; the land isn't small, and even though the grain harvest isn't enough to eat, I can trade my labor. My wife and daughter make clothes, so we're not struggling with that. I think I should be classified as a middle peasant household!"

The work team asked: "What do you think he should be classified as?"

The room spontaneously divided into groups, with three to five people whispering in each group. After a period of discussion, someone spoke: "I think he's a poor peasant; the land is extensive, but the yield is low. He has four rooms, but they are tiny and cramped." Someone else said: "I think he's also a poor peasant, because he has to do odd jobs to make ends meet, and he doesn't have any livestock." Another person said: "He only overturned his position [a term for those who benefitted from land reform] less than a year ago." After discussing, a woman stood up and said: "He should be classified as a poor peasant; his wife is semi-disabled, and his young daughter can't do much. He's the only one who's healthy." Another person jumped up and said: "Fu Lirong isn't being honest; he said he should be classified as a middle peasant, but the terms he describes suggest he should be a poor peasant..."

　　　　Flipping Over Less Than a Year　Poor Peasant Still a Poor Peasant

The work team asked: "Fu Lirong, what do *you* think you are? Everyone else is saying you're a poor peasant." Fu: "No objection!" The work team asked: "Does anyone else have any objections? Anyone can speak up." The crowd: "No objections!"

Next, another person declared, ending by saying: "According to the conditions from two years ago, I'm a poor peasant; according to last year, I'm a new middle peasant." The work team asked: "Have you been living a middle peasant's life for a full year?" Some of the crowd and the person himself said: "No, only one and a half seasons." The crowd again divided into groups for discussion; the result was that everyone said he was a poor peasant.

The third person was Fu Shouquan, who declared: "I didn't have much of a life before, but after the Eighth Route Army came, I acquired over ten mu of land. I raised a mule, but I borrowed money to buy it. I harvested eight shi of grain... not enough to eat. There are eight people in my family, and I often work odd jobs outside. I have a small house, and I have large and small farm tools, but no tables or chairs. In addition, I rent over seven mu of land from a widow, and I've cleared five or six mu of hillside wasteland. Because I'm tough, my life looks lively on the surface, but there's not much substance. I think I'm halfway between a poor peasant and a middle peasant." The crowd said that his land and yield weren't enough, he had debt, and he still had to work odd jobs outside. He had a mule, but it was like paper, because it was bought with debt. So he should still be considered a poor peasant.

Li Lizhi declared: "I have twelve and a half mu of land, and my grandson has seven mu. I have a donkey, my wife and I, and my grandson, his wife, and their three children. We split up the household before, but we've been living together again for ten years. I have all the small farm tools, but no large farm tools. The yield is just okay, and I don't have much debt. What do you all think? I don't know what to say. In the past, my child was a middle peasant, and I was a poor peasant. Now that we're living together, should I be considered a middle peasant too?" The crowd classified him as a middle peasant, because his yield was high, and he acquired the land before the arrival of the Eighth Route Army.

Fu Jinsheng declared: "I have twelve mu of land, with a yield of over eleven shi. I have a plow and a small donkey. I have no debt. I need the donkey to gather firewood just to make ends meet. There are four people in my family. I used to mortgage the land, but I've gradually redeemed it after rent reduction and debt clearing. I'm a middle peasant." The crowd's opinion: he's a new middle peasant, because he would never have been able to redeem the land if the Eighth Route Army hadn't come. He slowly redeemed the land at a rate of 1.5 mu by working in a kiln and spinning cotton after the rent reduction and debt clearing.

A major debate arose when Li Tiantang was classified. Li Tiantang had joined the army, and his mother declared: "I didn't have anything before, but I turned over after the Eighth Route Army came. I have 5.9 mu of land, with a yield of 6.2 shi. There are two people in my family, no livestock, and no debt. I think I should be considered a lower-middle peasant." A work team member explained: "We're not classifying lower-middle peasants this time. There's no such class; you're either a middle peasant or a poor peasant." She said: "I don't think I'm quite a middle peasant, so should I be considered a poor peasant?" After discussion, someone in the crowd pointed out: "His niece still has three mu of land that she farms. Her family is gone, so she eats at his house when she visits." "Her yield is enough; she should be considered a middle peasant." Another person said: "Before the bad years (1943), she was a poor peasant; she only got some land back after rent reduction. Her husband died, and her child is still young, so she suffered a lot. If you consider two people as three, then the land isn't enough. She doesn't have a house or farm tools. We think she's a poor peasant." "She's a middle peasant; she can't eat all her grain, her child joined the army, and someone else is farming her land. The village provides her with water and firewood; she doesn't have any difficulties, so she should be considered a middle peasant." At this point, the work team explained two things: (1) The population should be counted accurately during classification; you can't count two people as three. Remind everyone that classification and land distribution are separate. (2) Whether land is being farmed in place of a military family shouldn't be counted as a factor. Soldiers should still be counted as part of the family. After further consideration, the crowd classified her as a new middle peasant.

　　　　Two Conflicting Opinions　Temporarily Postponed for Further Discussion

Li Fushan's mother declared: "I have 7.7 mu of land, with a yield of 7.5 dou. There are three people in my family, my eldest son joined the army, and the second one is at home. I have no farm tools. I bought a donkey last year, accumulating 40,000 yuan in debt. I harvest four shi of coarse grain per year. Should I be considered a middle peasant?" The crowd had two opinions: some said she was a new middle peasant, and others said she was a poor peasant. Both opinions were temporarily reserved.

Some individuals with clear conditions and honest declarations were classified quickly. For example, the old man Li Hengsheng declared: "One person, 7.6 mu of land, with a yield of about seven shi. Half a donkey (shared with someone else), a seed drill and plow. I harvest two shi and four dou of millet, one shi and two dou of corn, and six dou of wheat per year. No debt, I don't sell labor, an old middle peasant, what else is there to say!" The crowd said: "The old man is right, that's very accurate!"

One person, Li Liucheng, would have been classified as an old middle peasant. His wife took two children to Wuxiang in the past, and worked in a kiln there for seventeen years before returning. The children in Wuxiang work in a kiln and live off that. With the money they saved they bought land. Two years ago, the family of four (the child had a wife) had three mu of land, and mainly relied on kiln work. Now she has returned and is living with Li Liucheng again. Her status will still be calculated according to her time in Wuxiang and classified as a worker.

Li Fuqing's mother's family is a landlord! Her status will be classified separately.

There were three opinions on Li Baoxi: middle peasant, new middle peasant, and poor peasant. He ultimately requested that a decision be made, but the crowd still had three opinions, so all were preserved.

Over sixty households participated in the classification in the ninth group, mostly completed on the 4th and 5th. On the morning of the 6th, some outstanding cases were resolved. Finally, the work team further explained to the crowd: (1) Anyone with different opinions can still express them; this is just the first announcement. There will definitely be errors in the classification. Please think about it, and bring it up again during the next classification. (2) It's easy to confuse new middle peasants and old middle peasants; the conditions should be based on those of 1939. The work team didn't make this clear beforehand, which was our fault. Households classified as old middle peasants should think about whether there were any errors. Everyone else should also think about it. (3) It's also difficult to distinguish between new middle peasants and poor peasants. To distinguish between middle peasants and poor peasants, the main thing is to see whether they are exploited, whether they sell their labor, whether they can support themselves without selling their labor, whether it's light or heavy work, and also to see how much "inside substance" they have, such as tools, capital, or stocks. We didn't pay enough attention to these aspects during classification. Everyone only focused on comparing land. Everyone can think about whether there were any errors in the classification of poor peasants and new middle peasants, and bring them up for us to resolve next time.

Some people immediately expressed disagreement with their own or others' class status. The work team respected every opinion and preserved them, announcing them publicly. Insisting on a unified opinion during the initial classification would stifle the masses' freedom of thought and speech.

Work team members from other groups visited the ninth group and encouraged the masses to visit as well, learning from the actual class classification. All groups conducted widespread mobilization and class education in the evening, and all were involved in the class classification movement the next day.

　　　　Mass Enthusiasm is High　Everyone Discusses Class Classification

This was indeed a mass movement, not just in form, but combined with the masses' political and economic demands; not just to classify who was what class, but the process of class classification was also the process of mobilizing the masses. The majority of the masses were very satisfied with the conditions for class classification, because they suited their economic demands. Poor peasants and new middle peasants could join the poor peasant association, which suited the political demands of most people. Furthermore, the previous class classification last winter was unreasonable, undemocratic, and crude, so the masses were even more enthusiastic about this class classification. They thought that the standards were reasonable, the method was democratic, and the process was detailed. Therefore, the masses' enthusiasm was very high during these days. During mealtimes, many people gathered in groups to discuss class classification, and they kept talking about it on the way home after the meetings. Some people in the fifth group were still calculating their land accounts late at night after the meeting. They said: "We have to calculate it clearly, thoroughly; this is a big deal, we can stay up for three days and three nights." Fu Lisuo was still talking in his sleep: "I think he's a poor peasant, he doesn't have anything!" Because they knew this was a big deal, the masses' attitude was also very serious. For example, two households in the fifth group still insisted on their own opinions about their class status, and six households in the sixth group also insisted on their own opinions. Some of the cases that were difficult to determine, such as Zhang Xiangfu and Li Baoxi, were discussed two or three times, but no definite result was reached. Some even asked those who thought their self-declarations were inaccurate to go back and get evidence and find witnesses. Fu Changshan wasn't at home, so he sent someone to represent him, but the crowd said: We won't discuss it unless he comes in person. Xing Huaizhu said: "It doesn't matter what class you classify me as, but you can't classify me wrong." Zhang Jun said: "If this is the final determination, we can discuss it until dawn." Before and during the class classification, the work team strongly encouraged the masses not to be constrained by personal feelings, not to be careless, not to be afraid, and to give opinions on themselves and others as much as possible. Pay attention to cultivating the backbone role of poor peasants and hired laborers in the middle (master the standards and dare to speak). Encourage people who raise opinions at the meeting, respect the opinions of the minority, take care of honest peasants and women, and encourage them to speak. The more debate there is, the more accurate the classification will be.

In some groups, the mobilization was not enough, and the organization and education of the poor peasant backbone were not enough (either they still did not speak, or they were separated from the masses), so democracy was not fully promoted in this class classification. When discussing honest peasants, the discussions were still enthusiastic, but when discussing cadres or "important figures" related to cadres, the venue became silent, or they did not dare to speak loudly, but only whispered. There was also very little dare to expose the inaccurate talk of these people, especially the "inside stuff" (funds, etc.), the masses could not figure it out, and dared not speak. The cadres participated in the class classification, and they even made fools of themselves and made faces at the meeting. Showing a relaxed and happy expression, this is a kind of pressure on the masses. There are also those who cannot break through the affection because of selfishness. There are also a few individuals who have retaliatory emotions, such as Zhang ××, others classified him as a middle peasant, and he encouraged others to classify others as middle peasants. There are also a few poor peasants who are just afraid that there is no land to fill, and want to classify a few rich middle peasants as much as possible.

Women generally still dare not speak, but they are also able to put forward more acute opinions, such as the inaccurate self-declaration of Li Baosan in the ninth group. The women calculated it out and brought it up. In the first group, the men were a little afraid of the group leader Wang Lantian, but the women put forward different opinions.

One advantage of this class classification is that the class education is relatively full. After repeated study and research with the masses in advance, the masses generally can master the standards. When expressing opinions, they made conclusions only after explaining the conditions. The phenomenon of "comparing life" and "comparing personality" is rare; some poor peasants who live a relatively prosperous life due to labor resolutely cannot be classified as middle peasants. For example, in the seventh and eighth groups, some people did not attend the first meeting. When they went to the second meeting, they compared the time again. The masses said to him: "You are behind! Class classification does not allow such comparisons." Some also requested comparisons at the meeting, and the work team comrades explained that they could not compare life and personality. They could only compare the five conditions, and the main thing was to compare whether or not they occupied land and other means of production, how much, and whether they were exploited or not.

After the initial class classification, the vast majority of poor and middle peasants were happy, and only a few old middle peasants showed anxiety. Li Baolai was classified as a middle peasant last winter, and this time he was classified as a poor peasant. He said: "This must be done well, and we can't disappoint people!" Poor peasant Fu Lirong has recently risen slightly, but has not yet reached the middle peasant level; he said: "Families like mine did not dare to rise any further in the past, but now it is easy to engage." Someone else said: "This is so much attention to labor, labor is red, and there is no exploitation, so we will never be fought against, so there will be someone to want land in the future, and the price will go up!" The poor peasants are also interested, because they know that there is hope for development after the distribution of land. In the class classification, it can also be seen that the peasants value labor very much. If the labor is good, the land is not enough, the grain yield is high, and the life is better, they all agree that it is a poor peasant; and for those who have poor labor and difficult lives, the masses do not sympathize.

After this class classification, there was an additional gain, which was to make a comprehensive survey of all land, quantity, quality, yield, population, livestock, farm tools, non-agricultural tools, houses, labor sales, and whether or not there were debts, and how much labor was available. According to these items, a table was printed, which was filled in during the self-declaration. However, this also has a problem. Because the table lacks items such as funds, capital, and land changes, asking and answering item by item limits the masses' thinking and cannot inspire the masses' thinking through self-declaration.

　　　　The First Announcement is Revealed, and People Compete to See It　Prepare Opinions and Discuss Again

After the first announcement was released, the literate masses enthusiastically went to see the announcement; those who were illiterate had others read it to them. The announcement was posted in three places: one in Zhaishang, and one each at the south and north ends of Xiajie. After it was posted, the masses here went to see it there, and the masses there went to see it here, and many dissatisfied opinions were raised, pointing out who was classified too high or too low, and preparing to bring it up for discussion during the next class classification.

　　什里店慎重划阶级
  　自报公议三榜定案不叫一人受屈
    【本报消息】武安九区什里店群众初划阶级进行了三天，三月六日划完，七日贴出了第一榜。这次划阶级，是根据新的规定，以生产关系及生产手段的占有为标准，自报公议，充分发扬民主，三榜定案的办法进行。参加划阶级的共三百三十户，划的结果：贫农一百二十一户，雇工二户，工人二户，手工业劳动者二户，新中农九十八户，中农八十户。未决定的二十五户，其中有贫农、新中农两种意见的十五户，有贫农、新中农、中农三种意见的四户，有新中农、中农两种意见的六户。因为没在家而没有参加划阶级的六户；过去定为头、二、三等斗争对象的这次暂且不让他们参加，留待下次再划。个别人在会上表示不同意别人或自己划定的成份，也在榜上写明。群众对这件事非常认真，工作组同志也完全尊重群众的意见，并保留任何一个人不同的意见。
    事先，工作组同志学习了划阶级的文件，明确了划分各个阶级的标准，并且分别找已串连的贫雇一起学习，结合具体情况作了研究。使自己和贫雇骨干都能掌握划阶级的标准。有的组开了家庭代表会议。
    　　　　学习文件掌握政策　结合实际作了研究
    讲明条件后，就随便找几个人试着划了，然后再讲明划的方法：自报公议，三榜定案。——自己把条件讲出来，自己说自己算哪个阶级，然后由群众公议。群众有不同意的，有多少种意见都可以，都写到榜上贴出来。以后大家再讨论，再出一次榜；最后再由全村任何人都来讨论，到大家完全一致，自己也同意，大多数群众都同意，才算定案。三榜之后自己还不同意的，还可以向人民法庭提出申诉。总之，要叫一个人也不受屈，划的时候要注意几点：（一）老老实实，是啥就说啥。（二）有不同的意见，在划的时候要讲理，可以争论；但不能吵架打架。（三）打破情面，不要包庇。（四）不许公报私仇。并宣布：一、工作组没权决定哪个人是啥成份，工作员只是拨灯棍，大家对条件不清楚时，可以讲一讲条件，拨一拨灯，使大家心眼明亮。二、划阶级和填补是两件事，划成贫农不一定就填，划成中农也可能分地，有的贫农多得了果实的也一定要退。
    三月四日，先在第九组（寨上）开始划。划以前，工作员再向大家说明这是个要紧事。然后就再把条件、方法、规矩给群众说明，尤其把条件反复说明，让群众能掌握住划阶级的标准。谈完之后，就让群众酝酿；酝酿好久，群众提出的一些疑问解答了之后，就宣布：“谁闹清楚了就开始自报吧！”
    　　　　开会首先讲标准　酝酿好了才开始
    傅立荣站了起来：“我就起个头吧！前年我八亩一分地，去年春天农会给补了一亩三，眼下总共九亩四分地。没牲口。有锄、锨、＠，没有大农具（犁、耙、耧）。粪土够上四亩地；种子不缺。三口人，只我算个劳动力。打粮食不够费用，得打短工补助。定的产量七石多；前年一年实收三石多谷子，一石玉茭，一共是四石七斗多粗粮。自己数算过的时光也还可以，地不算少，虽说打粮食不大够吃，我有劳力可以换；穿戴有老婆、闺女做，也不算困难。我说，算个中农户吧！”
    工作员问：“大家看他算个啥户？”
    会场中很随便的分成了几片片，一片有三、五个人在低声交谈。经过一阵酝酿，有人说话了：“我说他是个贫农，地虽说多，可是产量低。虽说有四间房子，可是小得扭不转身。”有人说：“我看也是个贫农；因为得给人家打短工才够吃，也没牲口。”有人说：“他才翻身，不够一年。”妇女坐的那一片酝酿后也站起一个人来说：“他该是个贫农，他娘儿们是个半残废，有个小妮子也还不支多大事。就他个人是好受家。”还有一个人从坐的地方跳下来说：“傅立荣说的太不老实，自己说的条件就是贫农，为啥自己又说是中农？………”
    　　　　翻身不满一年　贫农还是贫农
    工作员问：“傅立荣你自己看到底是啥？大家都说你是贫农。”傅：“没意见！”问：“大家还有没有意见？一个人有意见也能说。”群众：“没意见啦！”
    接着又自报了一个，他最后说：“按前年说是贫农，按去年说是新中农。”工作员就问：“过中农生活够一年了没有？”有些群众和他都说：“没有，才一季半。”群众又分片片酝酿；结果都说他是贫农。
    第三个是傅寿泉，他自报：“以前没时光，八路军来了才置了十来多亩地，喂了一个骡子，可是为买骡子借了债，一年打了八石谷子……不够吃。人八口，如常在外边打短工；有个小屋，有犁耧大小农具，没有桌椅板凳。此外租种了一个寡妇七亩多地，还开了五、六亩山坡荒地。因为人硬强，生活外表轰轰烈烈，内里没啥。我自己看是个半不塌子，贫农硬，中农软。”群众说他地亩产量都不够，有债，如常有人出去打短工；有个骡子，可是象纸糊的，因为是垒饥荒（债）买的。所以还得算个贫农。
    李立之自报：“我十二亩半地，我孙子七亩地，一个驴，俺老两口，孙子夫妻孩子三口。以前分过家，伙一起过又十来年啦。小农具都有，没有大农具。产量不过小，也没垒啥饥荒。您都评评吧，我也说不来。过去我孩子是中农，我是贫农。现在伙过着，我也算中农吧？”群众评定他是中农，因为产量高，地也都是八路军来以前置的。
    傅金生自报：“十二亩地，十一石多产量，一个犁，一个小驴，没债，用驴拾砍才够吃，四口人。地是过去当给人家的，减租清债以后才陆续清了回来。是中农。”群众的意见：是新中农。因为八路军不来他这地永赎不回来。是减租清债了，他家又上窑、纺花弄些钱一亩半分慢慢赎回来的。
    划到李田堂时发生了较大的争论。李田堂参军了，他母亲自报：“从前没任啥，八路军来以后翻了身，五亩九分地，六石二产量，两口人，没牲口，没饥荒。我说算个下中农。”工作员解释：这次划阶级不划下中农，没有这个阶级，是中农就是中农，贫农就是贫农。她说：“说中农我觉得也不相当，算贫农吧？”群众酝酿后有人提出：“他本家闺女还有三亩地她种着，闺女家没人了，只是闺女回娘家了到她家吃吃饭。”“她产量也够了，算是中农。”又有人说：“她在歹年景（四三年）以前是贫农，减租才减回点地；丈夫死了，小孩也不大，受了些罪。按两口化三口算，地就还不够，房、农具啥也没有。我们这一片说是贫农。”“是中农，她粮食吃不了，孩子参军走了，地土有人代耕，没水没柴村上也给，没啥困难，算个中农。”这时，工作员又解释了两点：（一）划阶级时人口要按实数算，不能两口算三口，有一口就算一口。提醒大家划阶级要跟填补分开。（二）抗属地代耕不代耕不能算到条件里去。参军的也仍作家里一口人算。群众再考虑的结果，把她划成了新中农。
    　　　　两种意见不一致　暂时搁下再讨论
    李福山娘自报：“七亩七分地，七石五斗四产量，三口人，老大参军走了，老二在家。没农具。年时个买了个驴，累了四万元饥荒。一年收了四石粗粮。算是中农？”群众有两种意见，有的说是新中农，有的说是贫农，都暂时保留。
    有些条件明确，讲的也实际，划的就很快。如李恒盛老汉自报：“一口人，七亩六分地，七石来产量，半个驴（和人家伙喂的一个），有耧犁，一年收了谷子两石四，玉茭一石二，麦子六斗，没饥荒，不卖工，老中农吧，还说啥哩！”群众说：“老头讲得对，这多实际！”
    有一个李流成，按他本人是老中农。老婆过去带了两个孩子到武乡，一直出去十七年才回来，孩子在武乡上窑，指上窑过活，余的钱买了地，前年四口人（孩子要了个媳妇）三亩地，主要还是靠上窑。现在她回来又和李流成伙过了。她的成份仍然照在武乡时算，定为工人。
    李福庆娘娘家是地主！她的成份另划。
    对李保锡有中农、新中农、贫农三种意见，他最后还要求决定下算了，群众讨论结果仍是三种意见，都保留了下来。
    九组参加划阶级的共六十多户，大体上四、五两日划完，六日上午又解决了一些悬案。最后工作员再向群众说明：（一）谁有不同的意见还可以再提；这次只是第一榜。一定有划错了的，大家转转脑筋，下次划时再提出来。（二）新中农和老中农容易划错，条件是看民国二十八年的条件，工作员事先没向大家说清楚，是我们不对。划老中农时有很多一嚷就过，划成老中农的户可想想是不是有划错的，大家也都想想。（三）新中农和贫农也有弄不清的；分别中农贫农，主要看受剥削不受，出卖劳动力不出卖，不出卖劳动力顾得住顾不住，看是轻活重活，还要看有多少“内瓤”，有啥别的工具、资本、股票，我们划时对这些方面注意得不够。大家就只注意比土地了。大家可以再想想，是不是贫农、新中农也有划错的，提出来咱下次解决。
    当场就有些人提出不同意自己或不同意别人成份的意见。对每一个人的意见工作员都予以尊重，保留下来，公布出去。在初划时主观要求得到统一的意见，就会堵死群众自由思想自由发言的门。
    其他各组的工作同志也有的到九组参观，并且动员群众也去参观，从实际划阶级中学习。各组晚上进行了普遍的动员和讲阶级，第二天就也都卷入了划阶级运动。
    　　　　群众情绪真高涨　人人谈论划阶级
    这的确是个群众性的运动，不只是形式，而是和群众的政治、经济要求相结合的；不只是为了划出谁是什么成份，划阶级的过程也就是发动群众的过程。大多数群众对于划阶级的条件是很满意的，因为正适合他们的经济要求；贫农、新中农可以参加贫农团，这正适合大部分人的政治要求。加以去冬划过一次阶级划得不合理，不民主，粗糙，群众更对这次划阶级热心。认为这次标准合理，方式民主，方法细致。所以在这几天中群众情绪很是高涨，吃饭时候，很多人一堆堆的在谈论划阶级的事，散会后一路上都还不断嚷嚷；五组有些群众夜半散会了还在打算盘算地亩帐，他们说：“要算清楚，弄个彻底，这是大事，三天三夜不睡也可以。”傅驴锁睡觉时还在说梦话：“我看就是贫农，没啥！”因为知道这是件大事，群众态度也很认真。如五组到最后仍有两户坚持自己对自己成份的意见，六组也有六户坚持自己的意见。对于有些不好确定的，如张祥付、李保锡等，讨论了两三次，得不到确定的结果。有些还要求认为他自报不确实的回去拿证据、找证人。傅长山自己没在家，找一个人代表他，群众说：非自己到场不讨论。邢怀珠说：“把我划成啥成份都没关系，不过可不能划错了。”张钧说：“这如果是最后一次确定，讨论到天明也可以。”工作组在划阶级前和划的过程中用力鼓励群众不要碍情面，不要马虎，不要害怕，对自己和别人尽量提意见。注意培养贫雇在中间起骨干作用，（掌握标准，并且敢说话。）在会上鼓励提意见的人，尊重少数人的意见，照顾老实农民和妇女，要他们说话。越有争论，越能划得确实。
    有的组因为发动得还不够，对贫雇骨干的没组织和教育不够（或者仍不说话，或者脱离群众），在这次划阶级中民主还是发扬得不够。讨论到老实农民时，酝酿得还热烈，讨论到干部或与干部有关的“人物头”时，会场就静默了，或者不敢大声谈，只是窃窃私语。这些人谈的有不确实的，也很少有人敢揭发，特别是“内瓤”（资金等），群众摸不清，更不敢讲。干部参加了划阶级，竟然还在会上出洋相、耍鬼脸。表现出轻松愉快的神气，这对群众是一种压力。也还有因为自私而打不破情面的。还有个别人有报复情绪，如张××，别人把他划成中农，他就鼓动把别人也划成中农，往上拉。还有少数贫农是只怕没地填，竟想尽量多划出几户富裕中农。
    妇女一般的还不敢说话，但也很能提比较尖锐的意见，如九组李保三自报的不确实，妇女一计算就算出来了，给提了出来。一组汉们还有点怕组长王蓝田，倒是妇女提出了不同的意见。
    这次划阶级的一个优点，就是讲阶级讲得比较充分，事先和群众经过几次反复研究学习，群众一般的都能掌握住标准，发表意见时按条件讲了之后才下结论。“比生活”、“比人格”的现象很少；有些因劳动而生活过得比较红火的贫农，坚决不能划中农。如第七、八组有第一次没参加会的，第二次去了，发表意见又是比时光，群众就对他说：“你落后了！划阶级不兴那样比。”有的在会上还要求比的，工作组同志说明不能比生活、比人格，要比只能比那五个条件，而且主要是比土地及其他生产资料的占有与否与多少及受剥削不受。
    经过初划阶级以后，绝大部分贫农、中农都是高兴的，只有个别老中农表现不安。李宝来去冬划成中农了，这次划成贫农，他说：“这可是得好好干，就是不亏人！”贫农傅立荣是最近稍有上升，还未到中农；他说：“象我这样的人家，过去不敢再上升，这以后可好搞了。”还有一个人说：“这样重视劳动，劳动得红，没剥削就永不会被斗，那地以后就有人要了，会要涨价哩！”贫农也感到兴趣，因为知道分地后有了发展的希望。在划阶级中，也可看出农民对于劳动很重视，劳动好，地不够，打粮食多，生活好一些，都一致说是贫农；而对于劳动差的，生活困难，群众也不同情。
    经过这次划阶级，附带还有一个收获，就是把中贫农所有土地、数量、好坏、产量、人口、牲口、农具、非农业工具、房子、买卖劳力、有无饥荒、劳力多少作了全面的调查。按照这些项目，印了一个表，在自报时就填写了。不过这也有个毛病，表上因少定了资金、股本、土地变化等项目，一项一项问答，对群众思想有了限制，不能借自报启发群众的思想。
    　　　　初榜揭晓人争看　准备意见再讨论
    出了第一榜后，识字的群众都热心地去看榜；不识字的让别人念着听。榜是分三处出的：寨上一处，下街南头、北头各一处，贴出后，这里群众去那里看，那里群众去这里看，又提出不少不满意的意见，指出哪些人定得高或低了，准备下次划阶级时再提出来讨论。
