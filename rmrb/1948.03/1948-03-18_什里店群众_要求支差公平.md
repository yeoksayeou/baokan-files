　　Villagers in Shili Store
　　Demand Fair Support for Public Service
　　Editor:
　　We talked with the villagers of Shili Store in the ninth district of Wu'an and learned that they have an urgent demand: fair support for public service. This village is located on the main road and has a reception station, making the public service burden particularly heavy. Each laborer has to perform public service an average of five or six times a month. Every day, regardless of whether there is actual service needed, seventeen or eight people and ten animals are required to "stand by" (standing by without actual service is not counted as work, it's a wasted day. Boiling water for passing troops, etc., is also not counted as work). Neighboring villages do not help with the service. In the first half of last year, the district accounted for it and owed Shili Store more than four thousand workdays. The district did not allocate any grain to offset these workdays. Originally, the district said that long-distance service would not be required, but last winter they were asked to transport public grain, and all male laborers and animals went, transporting a total of 30,000 jin, for a round trip of five days. When asked why the district still required long-distance service, the district said they had forgotten that Shili Store had a reception station and would resolve it later! It still hasn't been resolved. The second half of last year hasn't been accounted for yet, but it is estimated that the public service was even more than in the first half of the year.
　　We also encountered some cadre-like people on the main road who didn't seem to have any illness and didn't seem to need to ride animals, but they rode them grandly, and also had a civilian carry their luggage. Some came to ask for stretchers, but they didn't seem to necessarily need to lie on a stretcher. Such arbitrary mobilization of civilian labor, delaying mass production, is really inappropriate. It is hoped that comrades and organizations needing animals, laborers, and stretchers will consider whether they are absolutely necessary when mobilizing civilian labor.
　　This is the voice of the villagers of this village; I hope it can be published in the newspaper. Greetings!

　　Editor's note: The demand for fair public service support from the villagers of Shili Store deserves the attention of relevant parties to resolve. In particular, the arbitrary demands for service by some individuals and organizations, wasting civilian labor, should be corrected.

　　什里店群众
  　要求支差公平编辑同志：
    我们跟武安九区什里店群众谈话，知道他们有一个迫切要求，就是支差要公平。这个村子正在大路上，设有招待站，差务特别繁重，每个劳动力每月平均要出五、六次，每天不管有没有差务，都需要十七、八个人和十个牲口“听差”（听差而没有出差，还不算工，算白搭一天。来往过队伍烧水等也不算工）。附近村庄也没有帮差，去年上半年区上算帐，全区欠什里店四千多个工。区上也没有给拨支差米抵工。原先区上说可以不出长差，而去年冬天却又叫去送公粮，全部男劳动力和牲口都去了，总共运了三万斤，来回一共五天。问区上为什么还是要叫出长差，区上说把什里店有招待站忘了，以后再解决吧！至今仍然没有解决。去年下半年还没算帐，估计出差比上半年还要多。
    我们在大路上还碰到有些干部模样的人，并没有什么病，似乎没必要骑牲口，却大模大样骑在牲口上，还要一个老百姓背上行李。有的来要担架的，看样子也不是非躺在担架上不可的。这样随便动员民力，耽误群众生产，实在太不应该，希望要牲口、要民工、要担架的同志和机关，在动员民力时考虑究竟是不是一定需要。
    这是这个村子群众的呼声；希望能在报上给登出来。敬礼！

    编者按：关于什里店群众要求支差公平，值得引起有关方面注意解决。特别是一些个人和机关随意要差，浪费民力，更应注意纠正。
