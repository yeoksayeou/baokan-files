Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 26th: A fervent enlistment movement has recently swept through the Northeast Liberated Areas, with tens of thousands of turned-over peasants flocking to the reserve corps of various military regions. Since the launch of the movement in 53 districts in the southern Manchurian counties of Gushan, Haicheng, Liangping, Fengcheng, and Zhuanghe, over 20,000 volunteers have passed the screening. In Fengbao District of Gushan County, more than 2,000 young and middle-aged men formed a "Punish-Chiang Reserve Corps" and swore an oath to join the army and punish Chiang Kai-shek amidst fluttering military flags and resounding drums and gongs. In Tashan District of Haicheng County, more than a thousand people have applied for enlistment in the past half-month and have now been organized into the "Tashan Counter-Offensive Regiment." After the news of Li Zhengben's meritorious service on the front lines reached Danghou'an Village in Liangping County, it inspired 3,500 people to join the army. In the northern Manchurian counties of Songjiang and Hulan, more than 7,500 turned-over peasants who have enlisted in the army have recently been organized and are awaiting orders to assemble. Those who have signed up but are temporarily staying in their original locations are also requesting the establishment of reserve soldier organizations for on-the-spot training while continuing production. After the launch of the enlistment movement in Huachuan County, Hejiang Province, anti-offensive squads were established in every village and anti-offensive companies in every district, creating a highly enthusiastic atmosphere for joining the army. Reserve soldiers are also being organized in Heilongjiang and Nenjiang provinces, and the enlistment movement in Jilin and Mudanjiang provinces has been equally enthusiastic in the past two months.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 27th: The first class of trainees from the Political Cadre Training Camp of the People's Liberation Army has graduated this month after half a year of ideological education on land reform and war—covering general issues of political work and political affairs in companies. At the graduation ceremony, Tan Zheng, Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, called on everyone not to be arrogant or complacent in the future, but to study diligently and do a good job in three major areas: (1) Educate the troops so that everyone is not a "confused soldier," and on the basis of class consciousness, strive to learn tactics and techniques to improve the combat effectiveness of the troops; (2) Strengthen discipline education in the troops, cherish the people, cherish the people's strength, and protect the interests of the masses at all times and in all places; (3) Educate the troops to cherish the city, protect industry and commerce, and make it serve the people and the war. The trainees expressed their determination to complete the mission with enthusiasm. All graduates are now awaiting assignment to various units to directly dedicate themselves to the liberation war in Northeast China. It is reported that the second class of the camp will soon begin, with plans to recruit more than 1,200 trainees and expand into a training regiment to cultivate a large number of young political cadres.
