　　Detailed Explanation of the Land Law
  　Middle Peasants' Enthusiasm for Production Boosted
  　Knowing That Land Will Not Be Greatly Redistributed
  　Sending Manure Becomes More Energetic
    [Changzhi News] In the North and South Tianhe of the Second District, a meeting of more than 40 cadre team leaders was held on the night of the thirteenth day of the first lunar month to review the manure delivery achievements of the past ten days. It was calculated that only 40% of the manure in the entire village had been delivered, and the manure delivery performance was still not great. Village Chief Song Shuangfu said: "This year's enthusiasm for manure delivery is not high, mainly because everyone has ideological problems. We must debate this issue so that the manure delivery work can be completed quickly." Everyone immediately started a discussion. Guo Quanxi said: "In my team, Shen San suo is a middle peasant who doesn't send manure despite having livestock idle. I asked him, why aren't you sending manure? He said: I heard that the land is going to be divided equally, and my land is close to the emancipated households, and I don't even know which plot I'll be farming. I'm waiting to send manure after the land is divided. He also said: It's good to be poor now. I'm raising a donkey that's about to foal. If you have money, you will be struggled against. I explained to him that the Land Law Outline says that the floating property of middle and wealthy middle peasants will not be touched, and the land is still being negotiated for redistribution. What are you afraid of? After his thinking was straightened out, he started sending manure." Yang Heize said: "My third uncle, Yang Maozhen (a poor peasant), told me: We are emancipated households and have been allocated 13 mu of land. I heard that the Land Law Outline says that if you are allocated too much land, you have to return it, but I don't know how to return it. I was allocated 5 mu of ditch land. Last year, the wheat was good, and a lot of manure was applied. Even if I have to return land, I'd only be happy to return it after I harvest the wheat. I'm not sending manure now. I'll wait and see what happens. I told him: Your family doesn't have much land. Only a small amount will be taken from the wealthy middle peasants through negotiation. Middle peasants will not be greatly affected. Don't worry! Don't regret it when it's time to plant crops. After his thinking was straightened out, he started sending manure." After discovering these ideas, the cadres deeply reviewed that the publicity of the Land Law had not penetrated the masses. All cadre team leaders unanimously proposed to ensure that the Land Law is implemented among the masses and to complete the manure delivery work before the 25th.

    [Neiqiu News] According to materials from Zhaimengou in the Fourth District, Shentou in the Third District, and Liyang in the First District, after the peasants understood the Land Law Outline, they were all very happy, and their enthusiasm for production increased. Before understanding the basic spirit of the Outline, some middle peasants had confused ideas about being afraid of "equal distribution." After in-depth discussions and studies before and after the New Year, they were relieved. For example, Shentou held a mass meeting of the whole village on the fourth day of the first lunar month to discuss the Land Law and rectify production organization. After Political Director Guo Chun explained the Outline in detail, Hou Sanqun, a new middle peasant, said: "When I first heard that the Land Law Outline was going to divide the land equally, I secretly started calculating, wondering how much of my land would have to be given to others. It made me not know where to carry manure, so I didn't want to carry it to the fields. Later, after listening to the explanation of the Land Law Outline at the winter school, I was relieved and felt that it was the same to carry it to any field." Guo Caide said: "That day I told my Hongdan (his son) to carry manure to the fields, and he said that there was no need to carry it now, as the land was going to be divided equally. Who knows if we will be asked to farm that piece of land, let's wait until it is divided! After hearing the director's explanation today, what is there to be afraid of?" On the same day (the fourth day), the village's production organization was rectified, and a half-month spring plowing and production plan was formulated, proposing that all manure be carried to the fields within five days. Gathering firewood, repairing houses (houses burned by the enemy), cutting edges and building piles, and women seizing the time to develop weaving. On the third day of the first lunar month, Zhaimengou rectified mutual aid, and the whole village voluntarily formed three groups. The political director put forward slogans such as: "Spring is short this year, so we must start wasteland reclamation early and production early," and "Our village has more people and less land, so we can't get rich without reclaiming wasteland." On the same day, a total of 24 full and semi-laborers participated, organized wasteland reclamation and firewood collection, and 22 women were also organized to start weaving. On the evening of the tenth day, an expanded cadre meeting was held to check the progress. The three men's groups had reclaimed 11.5 mu of raw wasteland and collected 2,100 catties of firewood. The women wove 8 catties of cloth and spun 22 catties of yarn. Hao Laoni, Fang Taoni, and Li Pule, three poor hired women, were very happy to hear that women would also be allocated a share of land. They became more energetic in weaving and put forward the slogan: "This year we will change into unlined clothes, and we guarantee that we will never let men buy cloth to wear." Their method of combining learning and production is: reading documents and asking questions in the evening at the people's school, and discussing and researching in the production team during the day. After Liyang rectified mutual aid, it proposed that the current work should be rushed forward to welcome the filling movement, and formulated a plan to completely deliver all manure to the fields within five days and harrow the spring land once.

　　具体解释土地法
  　中农生产劲头大
  　知道土地不大动
  　送粪生产有了劲
    【长治消息】二区南北天河，在正月十三日夜召开各干部组长四十余人会，检查十天来送粪成绩。总计全村的粪土送了十分之四，送粪的成绩仍是不大，村长宋双富说：“今年送粪劲头不大，主要是大家有思想问题，咱们要把这个问题争论一下，就能使送粪的工作迅速完成。”大家即时展开讨论。郭全喜说：“我组里申三锁是个中农，闲着牲口不送粪，我问他你怎不送粪哩？他说：我听说要平分土地，我的地都靠着翻身户，还不知道自己种那块哩？我等着分了地以后才送粪哩。又说：现在是穷人好，我喂着一个驴，马上又要下驹子了，有钱就要吃斗争哩。我给他解释了土地法大纲上说的中农、富裕中农浮财不动，土地还是商量着抽哩，你害怕什么？把他的思想打通后他才送起粪来。”杨黑则说：“我三叔杨茂祯（贫农）和我说：咱是翻身户，分了十三亩地，我听说土地法大纲分的土地多了就得退地，可是不知道怎样退，分了五亩沟地，去年赶上麦子，上的粪又多，就是退地也是咱收了麦子才合心事哩。现在粪我也不送，有了个着落再说吧。我和他说：你家的地并不多，富裕中农也是商量着抽些哩，中农都不会大动，你放心吧！不要到种地时后悔不及。打通他的思想后，他才送开粪了。”经发现这些思想后，各干部深刻检讨了宣传土地法没有深入群众，各干部组长一致提出保证把土地法贯彻到群众中，二十五日以前完成送粪工作。（南北天河通讯组）
    【内邱消息】综合四区寨门沟、三区神头、一区李阳等村材料，农民闹懂了土地法大纲后，心里都很高兴，生产劲头也大了。有些中农在没闹通大纲的基本精神以前，存在着怕“平分”的糊涂思想，经过年节前后的深入讨论研究，也放了心。如神头正月初四召开全村群众大会，讨论土地法，整顿生产组织。政治主任郭纯又详细讲解了大纲以后，新中农侯三群说：“我刚一听说土地法大纲要平分土地，自己就暗打起算盘来，盘算我的地不知得给人家多少哩？闹的我担粪也不知担到那一块地里好，就不愿往地里担了。后来在冬校听了土地法大纲的讲解，我才放了心，感到担到那块地里也是一样。”郭才德说：“那天我叫俺红蛋（他小子）往地里担粪，他说现在不用担了，要平分土地呀，谁知道那块地还叫咱种，等平分好了才说吧！今天听主任这一解释这还怕啥。”当天（初四）就整顿了全村的生产组织，订出了半个月春耕生产计划，提出五天内要把粪全部担运到地里。打柴修房（被敌烧坏的房子），斩边垒椿，妇女抓紧开展纺织。寨门沟大年初三就整顿了互助，全村自愿结合成三个小组，政治主任提出：“今年春短，要早开荒生产”，“咱村人多地少，不开荒地富不了”等口号，当天共参加了二十四个整半劳力，组织了开荒、拾柴，妇女们也有二十二个人组织起来，开始了纺织，到初十晚上又召开扩大干部会，检查了一下，三个男子组已开生荒十一亩五分，打柴二千一百斤。妇女们织布八斤，纺线廿二斤。郝劳妮、房桃妮、李浦了三个贫雇妇女，听说要叫妇女同样分一份土地，非常高兴，纺织中也起了劲，并提出口号说：“今年换单衣，保证再不叫男人买布穿。”他们学习与生产结合的方式是：晚上在民校讲读文件提问题，白天在生产组里讨论研究。李阳整顿了互助以后，提出了现在活要紧往前赶，来迎接填补运动，订出了五天要把所有粪完全送到地里，春地通耢耙一遍的计划。
