　　Discussion and Research
    Recently, we have received many letters from readers raising numerous questions regarding various aspects of land reform, which we find very good. Some questions have been asked by several readers simultaneously, indicating that they represent the thoughts and understanding of a segment of cadres, Party members, and the masses. We now intend to use a certain amount of space to answer those questions that are more universal. We hope everyone will continue to raise questions, but they must be written specifically and clearly. The answers here may not be entirely correct, and if you have any opinions, you can raise them again for discussion and research.

    Should miners participate in the Poor Peasants' League?
    (Answer to the Trade Union of the Shigieshan Coal Mine)

    The Shigieshan Coal Mine uses machinery for production. Miners are industrial workers, not peasants or rural handicraftsmen. Industrial workers have their own organization—the trade union—and should not participate in the Poor Peasants' League.

    According to your letter, many of your coal mine workers live in villages near the mining area, and most of their families own land. The villages are calling them back to participate in the Poor Peasants' League, and they are not coming to work in the mine, which has already affected production, and the amount of coal produced is not enough for public use. We believe that under these circumstances, miners should not go back to participate in the Poor Peasants' League even more. Now that this phenomenon has already occurred, it is necessary to find ways to correct it immediately. We hope that on the one hand, you will explain to the miners the importance of the current coal mine production tasks and persuade them to continue working in the mine. On the other hand, you should send people to each village to discuss and resolve the land problems faced by the workers based on the specific circumstances of the local area and each miner, together with the farmers' association, so that they can concentrate on working in the mine. If you still cannot solve the problem, you should obtain the assistance of the local government or report to the higher leading organs to seek a solution together. Because at present, industrial and mining production is extremely important, and industrial production must absolutely not be affected because of land reform in rural areas. It is wrong for the villages to mobilize employed workers to return home to divide the land, and this should also be explained to them. As for the land problem of workers, it cannot be handled in the same way as the land problem of ordinary peasants. In principle, if the worker's family lives in the countryside, and the wage income is not enough to maintain the life of the family, and a part of land or other property is needed, then a part of land or other property can be distributed; if the wage can already maintain the life of the family, then land or other property should not be distributed. But if the worker (whose family is in the countryside) is only working temporarily or as a sideline production (such as small kiln workers in various places), then the worker himself and his family should be divided the same land and property as the peasants. Workers should understand: In this land redistribution, if a worker should be given a part of the land, it must be given; if he should not be given the land, it is useless even if he goes back to participate in the Poor Peasants' League. Therefore, workers whose families own land can rest assured that they can produce in the mine, and it does not matter whether they participate in the Poor Peasants' League or not.

    Should industrial workers be allocated land? What if they lose their jobs?
    (Answer to the Taihang Textile Factory Study Group)

    Industrial workers generally do not have land and do not need land, so there is no need to allocate land. If some workers' families originally had some land, or need land due to special circumstances, and obtain the consent of the farmers' association, then it should be appropriately resolved according to the specific situation, but it cannot be handled in the same way as the land problem of ordinary peasants. Generally speaking, the land problem of workers should be handled according to the following methods: 1. All workers in the countryside, because the wage income is not enough to maintain the life of the family, and a part of land or other property is needed, should be allocated a part of land or other property. If the wage is already able to maintain life, land and property should not be allocated to him. 2. If a worker's family originally had a part of land, and because he went out to work, he was unable to cultivate it, and only by renting the land or hiring workers to cultivate it could he maintain the life of the whole family, it cannot be confiscated and distributed. 3. If the worker's family is a landlord or rich peasant component, then all land property connected to the landlord's land should be confiscated, and the surplus land property connected to the old-style rich peasant land should be requisitioned. However, the worker's labor and all property not connected to the landlord's land should be protected and should not be infringed upon in the slightest. 4. If a worker is wealthy due to wages or other labor income, his property shall not be infringed upon in any way, but he should no longer be allocated land or property. Therefore, workers basically cannot rely on land for a living. If they lose their jobs, the democratic government and the workers' organization—the trade union—can find other ways to solve their living difficulties, such as introducing work, changing jobs, providing relief, etc. If the worker has already lost his job and cannot find a new job temporarily, with his consent, the local government can introduce him back home to divide the land. In fact, in the new democratic society, industry and commerce will continue to develop greatly in the future; as industry and commerce develop, the lives of workers will also improve, and the worry of unemployment is unnecessary. In the future, there will only be a shortage of workers, and the phenomenon of unemployment will not exist for a long time. Therefore, workers should now work hard and concentrate on production, and not let the land redistribution in rural areas affect their work. In the new democratic society, the lives of all working people must be guaranteed, and the future of workers is particularly bright.

    Is there exploitation in state-owned factories?
    (Answer to the Taihang Textile Factory Study Group)

    Workers in all state-owned factories in the liberated areas cannot be considered exploited. Because the new democratic society is mainly controlled by workers and other working people; all state-owned factories are collectively owned by workers and other working people, and workers and the factory are both masters of the factory. The wealth created by the labor of workers has partly become wages, as their own living expenses; the rest is for the benefit of all the people, which is also for their own long-term interests, and cannot be considered exploited. For example, all workers working in state-owned factories today are directly or indirectly working to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek; only by overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek can the interests of the workers be permanently guaranteed, and the improvement of life can be finally guaranteed. Therefore, workers in state-owned factories work for their own interests, so they must work more actively and make greater contributions to the Chinese People's Liberation War and the construction of the new democratic cause. In the privately-owned factories in the liberated areas, the exploitation suffered by workers has also been reduced. Working in privately-owned factories is also beneficial to the people in the liberated areas and is also in line with the long-term interests of the working class. Therefore, workers in both state-owned and privately-owned factories should work hard, develop production, prosper the economy, and create more wealth for the new society.

    What is meant by excessively high labor conditions?
    (Answer to Comrade Li Feng of Yuji Factory)

    You said that you don't understand a sentence in the "February 7th" editorial. This sentence is: "The leaders of the workers' movement must never aim at short-sighted, one-sided so-called workers' welfare, and propose excessively high labor conditions." Chairman Mao also talked about this in the report "The Current Situation and Our Tasks." This is a very important issue. In the past, among many comrades who engaged in the workers' movement, there was a fairly common wrong view: aiming at short-sighted, one-sided so-called workers' welfare, failing to see the long-term interests of the working class, simply demanding increased wages, thinking that it was seeking benefits for the workers, and making excessively high wage demands or other living benefits to the factories or private industrialists and businessmen, making it impossible for industrialists and businessmen to obtain appropriate profits. Chairman Mao's correct policy for industry and commerce is to develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital. All policies, measures, and decisions that deviate from this overall goal are wrong. Wage increases and improved treatment for workers must not affect the development of industry and commerce. Whether state-owned or privately-owned, the factory must guarantee a considerable profit; otherwise, the factory will have to close down, which is not conducive to the improvement of the living standards of the entire working people, and workers will also have to lose their jobs. Today, the highest interest of workers is to develop industry and commerce. Therefore, comrades who engage in the workers' movement, on the one hand, must ensure that workers' lives are appropriately improved; on the other hand, they must also ensure that the factory does not become unprofitable due to excessively high wages and other living benefits for workers. Of course, in the future, when the factory makes money, the lives of workers will be able to improve.

　　讨论与研究
    近来我们接到不少读者来信，对于土地改革各方面提出了许多的问题，我们认为很好。有些问题，同时有好几个读者写信来问，可见代表了一部分干部、党员、群众的思想和认识。现在我们打算以一定的篇幅来答复那些带有较普遍性的问题，希望大家有问题继续提出来，但一定要写得具体、明确。这里的答复不见得尽对，大家如有意见，也还可以再提出来讨论和研究。
    矿工是否应该参加贫农团？
    （答石圪节解放煤矿职工会）
    石圪节煤矿用机器生产，矿工是产业工人，并非农民，也不是农村手工业者，产业工人有自己的组织——职工会，不应该参加贫农团。
    根据来信，你们煤矿的工人，多住矿区附近乡村，家里大部分种有土地，村里叫他们回去参加贫农团，不来矿上做工，现在已经影响了生产，出的煤不够公家使用。我们认为在这种情况下，矿工就更不应该回去参加贫农团。现在既已发生这种现象，就必须设法立即加以纠正。希望你们一方面很好的向矿工们解释说明目前煤矿生产任务的重要，说服工人继续留在矿上工作。另一方面则应派人到各该村，根据当地及各个矿工的具体情况，与农会共同商量解决工人们所存在的土地问题，使其安心在矿上从事工作。如果你们仍不能解决，则应取得当地政府的帮助，或报告上级领导机关来共同求得解决。因为目前工矿业生产极端重要，绝对不能因为农村在搞土地改革而影响工业生产。村里去动员在业工人回家分地是不对的，也应向他们加以解释说明。至于工人的土地问题，不能照一般农民的土地问题同样处理。在原则上，如果工人家住在乡村，工资收入不足维持一家人生活，需要一部分土地或其他财产时，才能分给一部分土地或其他财产；如果靠工资已经能维持一家人生活的，便不应分给土地或其他财产。但如果工人（家在乡村的）作工只是临时性质，或作为副业生产（如各地小窑工），则工人本人及其家属均应与农民分得同样的土地和财产。工人们应该了解：这次平分土地，如果哪一个工人应该分给一部分土地的一定要分给，如果不该分给土地，即使回去参加了贫农团也没有用。所以家里种有土地的工人们尽可以安心在矿上生产，参加不参加贫农团都没有什么关系。
    产业工人是否分给土地？失了业怎办？
    （答太行纱厂学习小组）
    产业工人一般没有土地，也不需要土地，因此不必分给土地。如果有的工人家里原来就有些土地，或者因为特殊情形需要土地，并且得到农会同意的，则应根据具体情况适当解决，但不能和一般农民的土地问题同样处理。一般的说，工人的土地问题应根据下面的办法来处理：一、凡属乡村中工人，因工资收入不够维持一家人生活，需要一部分土地或其他财产的，应该分给一部分土地或其他财产。如果工资已经能够维持生活的，不应分给他土地和财产。二、工人家里原来有一部分土地，因自己出外做工，无力耕种，把地出租或雇工耕种才能维持全家生活的，不能征收分配。三、工人家庭如果是地主富农成份，则应没收与地主土地相连的一切土地财产，征收与旧式富农土地相连的多余土地财产。但工人劳动及其一切不与地主土地相连的财产，应受保护，不能稍有侵犯。四、工人因工资或其他劳动收入而生活富裕的，他的财产一概不得侵犯，但也不应再分给他土地或财产。因此，工人基本上不能依靠土地生活，如果失了业，民主政府和工人组织——职工会，可以另想其他办法解决他的生活困难，如介绍工作、转业、救济等。如果工人现在已经失了业，暂时又找不到新工作，经本人同意，则可以由现住地区政府介绍回家分地。事实上，在新民主主义社会里，工商业今后还要大大的发展；工商业发展了，工人生活也还会改善，失业的顾虑是不必要的，将来只会有工人不够，失业的现象是不会长期存在的。因此，工人们现在应该好好安心生产，不要因为农村里闹土地平分而影响工作。在新民主主义社会里，对一切劳动人民的生活都要有保障，而工人的前途尤为远大。
    公营工厂有无剥削？
    （答太行纱厂学习小组）
    在解放区的一切公营工厂中的工人，不能认为是被剥削。因为新民主主义社会，主要就是由工人及其他劳动人民共同支配；一切公营工厂是由工人及其他劳动人民集体占有，工人和厂方同样是工厂的主人。工人劳动力所创造的财富，一部分已经变成工资，作为工人自己的生活费用；剩余的一部分是为全体人民谋利，也就是为了自己长远的利益，不能认为被剥削。比如今天一切在公营工厂工作的工人，都是直接或间接的为了打倒蒋介石；把蒋介石打倒了，工人的利益才有永久的保障，生活的改善才有最后的保证。因此，公营工厂的工人，是为了自己的利益而工作，就要更积极的工作，对中国人民解放战争和新民主主义的建设事业作更大的贡献。在解放区的私人工厂中，工人所受的剥削也减轻了，为私人工厂工作，对解放区人民也是有利的，与工人阶级的远大利益也是相符合的。因此，无论公营私营工厂里的工人，都应当好好的工作，发展生产，繁荣经济，为新社会创造更多的财富。
    什么叫过高的劳动条件？
    （答裕记工厂李锋同志）
    你说“二七”社论里面有句话看不懂，这一句话是：“职工运动的领导者们，绝对不许可以近视的、片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标，提出过高的劳动条件。”毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告中也谈到这一点，这是一个很重要的问题。过去许多作职工运动的同志中间，存在一种相当普遍的错误观点：以近视的片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标，看不到工人阶级长远的利益，单纯的要求增加工资，以为就是给工人们谋了利益，向厂方或私人工商业家提出过高的工资要求或其他生活待遇，使工商业者无适当的利润可图。毛主席对工商业的正确的方针，是以发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利为目标，一切离开这个总目标的方针、政策、办法、决定都是错误的。工人增资与改善待遇，必须不影响工商业的发展。无论公营私营，厂方必须保证有相当利润，否则工厂就会要关门，对整个劳动人民生活的提高不利，工人也会要失业。今天工人们最高的利益就是发展工商业，因此，作职工运动的同志，一方面要保证工人们生活适当的得到改善；一方面还要使厂方不因工资及工人其他生活待遇过高而无利可图。当然，将来厂方赚了钱，工人生活是能够改善的。
