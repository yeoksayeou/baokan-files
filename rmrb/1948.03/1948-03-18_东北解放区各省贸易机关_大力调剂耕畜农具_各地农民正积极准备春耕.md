  　Vigorously Regulate Draft Animals and Farm Implements
    Farmers in Various Localities Are Actively Preparing for Spring Plowing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th] In order to launch a large-scale production campaign, trade organizations in various provinces of the Northeast Liberated Area are actively assisting farmers in acquiring draft animals and farm implements, and regulating grain supply. Liaobei Province has a larger number of cattle and horses. The Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry is purchasing 10,000 heads of livestock on behalf of the Rehe Liberated Area. 3,000 heads have already been collected and will be sent to Rehe soon. The province's trade organizations are also regulating 1.9 million jin of soybean cakes for various counties within the province for use as livestock feed. The Trade Bureau has also transferred a large quantity of plowshares and coke to the Tongliao masses who were lacking in these items. The plowshare furnace opened by the bureau can produce 400 plowshares every day, supplying them to various places. The Jilin Provincial Trade Bureau bought 20,000 plowshares and 2,200 tons of fertilizer last year, and will continue to distribute them to various places. The bureau is experimenting with modifying automobile heads into small tractors, equipped with four plowshares, which can be equivalent to the power of ten cattle. They are now hiring specialized technicians to continue research, and will promote their application after success. Heilongjiang Province has prepared 14,000 plowshares to meet the needs of various regions, and has prepared 1,400 tons of seeds for disaster-stricken areas in other provinces. Songjiang Trading Company has regulated more than 3,000 tons of sorghum and millet seeds from Heilongjiang and Nenjiang provinces for disaster-stricken farmers in Lalin and other places. In addition to organizing the purchase of horses and fertilizers and ordering agricultural machinery, the Northeast Trade Bureau will also specifically discuss the issue of coordinating with spring plowing at the current joint conference of directors of provincial, municipal, and county trade bureaus, so as to better promote the spring plowing and large-scale production campaign in various places.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th] Various parts of the Northeast Liberated Area are now actively preparing for an unprecedented spring production campaign. In the northern Manchurian provinces of Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Songjiang, the transition from land reform to preparations for spring plowing is underway. Many areas are striving to deliver manure before the thaw under the slogan "Send a cart of manure, increase a bushel of grain." It is estimated that if one-third to one-half of the land in the entire area can be manured, it can guarantee a one-third increase in grain production this year. In the fifth district of Lalin County, Songjiang Province, 24 administrative villages have a constant flow of manure carts and sleds every day, of which five villages had completed the delivery of all accumulated fertilizer half a month ago. Farmers in Huanan, Jixian, Tangyuan and other counties in Hejiang Province deliver and collect manure during the day, and hold meetings at night to correct wrongly classified households, which further increases farmers' enthusiasm for production. The Heilongjiang Provincial Government issued an urgent instruction last month to guarantee an increase of 240,000 tons of grain this year. Mutual aid and cooperation have now been widely organized in various places, exchanging labor and draft animals, and helping landlords solve the problems of draft animals and production tools, so that they can cultivate diligently. The Liaodong Office of the Northeast Political Committee also announced the outline of agricultural production, stipulating that not a single mu of land should be left uncultivated, restoring the normal annual output, and reclaiming wasteland. Now each village and household are making production plans. Women and children in Shuangchahe Village, Ji'an County, held a meeting to discuss the matter a few days ago, and then started working together, collecting 63 baskets of manure and 62 bundles of firewood on the first day. Women from the poor peasant group in Zhengjiabao Village, Liuhe, picked more than 3,000 jin of manure in one day. Counties in Liaodong that had poor harvests last autumn have also formulated measures to save food and prepare for famine. In addition to actively preparing to sow early-maturing crops and organizing sideline production, each district, village and household is simultaneously carrying out a mutual assistance and mutual teaching movement. Liaobei Province allocated 500 million yuan in agricultural loans last month, and plans to expand this year's cultivated area by 106,500 hectares, calling on all regions to cultivate deeply and carefully, build water conservancy projects, and complete the task of increasing grain production by 75,000 tons.

　　东北解放区各省贸易机关
  　大力调剂耕畜农具
    各地农民正积极准备春耕
    【新华社东北十五日电】东北解放区各省贸易机关为发动大生产运动，积极协助农民添置耕畜农具，调剂粮食。辽北省牛马较多，省府农林处替热河解放区代购牲口一万匹，现已集中三千匹，不日即可送往热河。该省贸易机关并为省内各县调剂豆饼一百九十万斤，作牲口饲料。通辽群众缺乏犁铧及焦炭，贸易局也已大批调剂。该局开设之制铧炉，每天能出犁铧四百个，源源供应各地。吉林省贸易局去年买了二万个犁铧及二千二百吨肥田粉，将继续分配各地。该局以汽车头试验改制小型拖拉机，装配四个犁铧，可抵十个牛力。现正聘请专门技师继续进行研究，成功后即将推广应用。黑龙江省筹备了犁铧一万四千个，以供应各地需要。并为他省受灾地区筹备籽种一千四百吨。松江贸易公司为拉林等地受灾农民调剂种籽，已向黑龙江、嫩江各省换来高粱及谷籽种三千余吨。东北贸易总局最近除组织买马买肥定制部分农业机器外，并将在现正举行之各省市县贸易局长联席会议上专门讨论配合春耕问题，以便更好的推动各地春耕大生产运动。
    【新华社东北十五日电】东北解放区各地现正积极准备空前规模的春季大生产运动。北满合江、黑龙江、松江等省已由土地改革转入准备春耕，很多地区在“送上一车粪，增加一斗粮”的口号下，争取解冻前将粪送完。预计全区如能三分之一到二分之一的地上粪，即可保证今年增产三分之一的粮食。松江省拉林县五区二十四个行政村每天粪车爬犁川流不息，其中五个村半个月前已将全部积肥送完。合江省桦南、集贤、汤原等县农民白天送粪拾粪，晚上开会，改正划错成份户，农民生产热情益加高涨。黑龙江省政府月前曾发布紧急指示，保证今年增粮二十四万吨。各地现已普遍组织合作互助，换工换犋，并帮助地主解决耕畜与生产工具，使其勤劳耕种。东北政委会辽东办事处也公布了农业生产大纲，规定不荒一亩地，恢复常年产量，并开垦生荒，现各村各户均纷订生产计划。辑安县双岔河村妇女儿童日前集会讨论后，就一齐动手，头一天即拾了六十三筐粪，打了六十二捆柴。柳河郑家堡村仅贫农团妇女，一天即拣了三千多斤粪。辽东去秋歉收县份并纷纷拟定节约备荒办法，各区村除积极准备播种早熟作物及组织副业生产外，村村户户同时展开互助互教运动。辽北省则于月前拨出农贷五亿元，并计划扩大今年耕地面积十万六千五百余垧，号召各地深耕细作，兴修水利，完成增粮七万五千吨的任务。
