　　Xiyang and Lin Counties Mobilize Village Cadres to Intensify Leadership in Spring Plowing
　　[Our dispatch] The first district of Xiyang County convened an enlarged meeting of village cadres on the 2nd of this month to discuss the Land Law, dispel muddled thinking among village cadres, and inspire their enthusiasm for actively leading production. After three days of discussion, significant results were achieved. Luo Yantou village chief, after reflecting on his forgetting-his-roots mentality, said: "What's done is done, but from now on, I will serve the poor brothers with the spirit of a hired laborer. Now, the people who are least concerned about production are not the masses, but myself. Last year, we suffered from famine. If we delay the masses again this year, our sins will be even greater." Yang Xuefeng village chief Zhang Si said: "The fact that the masses are giving us opinions proves that they care about us and want to reform us. I've completely forgotten the suffering I endured in the past, and now I'm afraid of getting dirty when carrying soil, only worrying about myself. My behavior is entirely like that of a feudal landlord. We must change these bad habits. Only by setting aside the burden of thinking only of ourselves and honestly serving the masses can we avoid sin." After such discussions, everyone's thinking was cleared, and they were very happy, and their enthusiasm was raised again. Then they discussed four important tasks in spring plowing: (1) First, take out a portion of the fruit-bearing land to supplement the land-poor and landless poor peasants, and then distribute a portion of the stored grain to the grainless and grain-deficient poor peasants to solve the spring famine problem. (2) Help poor women with tools and raw materials, freely combine, and organize large-scale textile production. (3) Rectify mutual aid teams and actively prepare to raise seeds. (4) Transform cooperatives to support spring plowing work.
　　[Taihang dispatch] The 11th district of Lin County held a joint meeting of key village cadres and poor peasant representatives on the 24th of last month to address the cadres' reluctance to lead production and their passive attitude. At the meeting, Deputy District Chief Niu first called on everyone to talk about their feelings, shed their burdens, and find the root causes of their lack of enthusiasm for work. During the discussion, some village cadres said: "Now that the poor peasants have risen up, we're just going through the motions. We'll just wait to be replaced!" Zhao Suo village chief Peng Qinghui also said: "This cadre has been replaced, that cadre has been replaced. I'm just waiting to be replaced this time." Based on these thoughts, the district put forward the following three questions for everyone to discuss: (1) Is it right that we didn't do good things for the masses in the past, and now we don't hurry to lead production and just lie down and do nothing? (2) Does the rise of the masses mean that they want to overthrow all the cadres? (3) Is it because they made big mistakes that some cadres were overthrown in the past? Shi Chongyuan, a poor peasant from Jing Shan Village, said: "The masses do not want to overthrow all the cadres. Bad ones should of course be replaced, but good ones should still be supported. You are old cadres and you still have to lead!" Shi Yongjiang, a poor peasant from Yu Koumen Village, said: "You are old cadres! Don't all be afraid of being overthrown. Those who are overthrown are always the ones who make big mistakes. Good ones will never be overthrown. The masses have eyes." After the masses finished speaking, Yue Linyu, the political director of Jingtou, said: "A few days ago, because the poor peasants were about to rise up, and coupled with the conflicts among the cadres, I became pessimistic and lay down for two days, doing nothing. Now I feel very wrong. This time I must get up and lead production." Jin Baoshou, the political director of Niuling Mountain, said: "Your thoughts are all different from mine. I am just afraid that the masses will not give me opinions. How can cadres do without the masses?" Finally, Deputy District Chief Niu more clearly pointed out: "The masses and the superiors can clearly distinguish whether a cadre is good or bad, and they will never be wronged. Go back and lead production well." After the meeting, most of the good cadres and cadres with minor mistakes were relieved and wanted to lead production well.

　　昔阳林县动员村干部
  　加紧领导春耕
    【本报消息】昔阳一区，在本月二日召开全区村干扩大会，讨论了土地法，解除村干糊涂思想，并启发其积极领导生产的热情，经三天讨论，收效很不小：落雁头村长反省了自己的忘本思想后说：“过去尿在地下收不起来了，只有今后以当长工的精神，低下头为穷苦兄弟们办事，现在最不安心生产的，不是群众正是自己。去年遭了灾荒，今年再让群众遭耽误的灾，咱的罪就越大了。”杨学峰村长张四小说：“群众给咱提意见，证明是关心咱想改造咱，把过去自己受的苦都忘净了，现在担土还怕当上灰，光怕穷人脏。咱的行为尽学封建地主的，这些坏作风一定要改掉，只有放下光为自己打算的包袱，老老实实给群众办事才能免了罪。”经这样讨论，大家思想打通后都很高兴，积极性又提起来了。接着讨论了春耕中四件重要工作：（一）先拿出一部果实地，补给少地无地的贫农，再将一部存粮分给无粮缺粮的贫雇以解决春荒问题。（二）帮助贫苦妇女工具原料，自由结合，组织大量纺织。（三）整顿互助组积极准备养种，（四）改造合作社扶助春耕工作。
    【太行消息】林县十一区于上月二十四日开各村主要干部和贫雇联席会，解决干部不安心领导生产和躺倒不干的思想。会上首由牛副区长号召大家谈心事，放包袱、找工作不起劲的根源。酝酿讨论时，有的村干部就这样说：“现在贫雇起来了，咱就是当一天和尚撞一天钟，那会叫人家换了就算啦！”赵所村村长彭清会也说：“人家这个干部换啦，那个换啦，我这次就等着换哩。”区上根据这些思想，提出以下三个问题让大家讨论：（一）过去没为群众办好事，现在还不赶快领导生产，躺倒不干，对不对？（二）群众起来是不是要垮一切干部的台？（三）过去有些干部垮了台，是不是怨他们有大错？井山村贫雇石重元说：“群众并不是要垮一切干部的台，坏的当然要撤换，好的还是要拥护，你们是老干部，还得领导哩！”峪门口贫雇石用江说：“你们是老干部啦！不要都怕垮台，垮台的总是犯大错的，好的总垮不了，群众是有眼的。”群众说完后，井头政治主任岳林玉便说：“前几天因为贫雇要起来，又加上干部间搞矛盾，就悲观了，躺了两天，啥也没干。现在我觉得很不对。这次回去一定要起来领导生产。”牛岭山政治主任靳保守说：“你们思想都与我不一样，我是光怕群众不给我提意见，干部没有群众了还能行？”最后牛副区长更明确的指出：“干部是好是坏，群众和上级是分得清，绝不会冤枉了，回去要好好领导生产才对。”散会后，大部分好干部和错误小的干部都安了心，要好好领导生产。
