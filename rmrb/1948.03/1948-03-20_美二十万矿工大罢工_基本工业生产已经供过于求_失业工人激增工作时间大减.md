Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 18th: Reports from various sources: The third wage increase movement of American labor after the war has gradually evolved into a large-scale strike situation. Upon hearing the notification from John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, that the mine owners had violated the pension agreement in the collective contract (which stipulates that each ton of coal produced by each mine would be charged one dime as a pension fund, so as to pay a monthly pension of $100 to those who have worked in the mine for 20 years and are 60 years old), coal miners in ten states, including Pennsylvania, without waiting for a formal strike order, were furious and spontaneously went on strike from the 15th; and quickly spread from Pennsylvania to the western states. As of the 16th, the number of striking miners had exceeded 160,000. An Associated Press survey even stated that the number of miners participating in strikes and slowdowns across the country has reached 202,100, accounting for half of the 400,000 miners. A spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America predicted that the strike would cause a daily loss of nearly 500,000 tons of coal production and would paralyze all coal mines. Factory representatives were extremely panicked by this and believed that if the strike persisted for more than 16 days, steel mills would have to close.

At the same time, after the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA), affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), rejected the wage increase request from the capitalists, regardless of Truman's interference of "postponing the strike", they began striking at midnight on the 16th. The strike started in New York and spread to the Chicago slaughter center an hour later. According to a union spokesman, 100,000 workers in 140 factories across the country will participate in the strike. Nearly 30,000 people are now involved in the strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 17th: New York dispatch: According to the Associated Press's "Weekly Business" report on the 14th, the production of basic American industries "this week has come closer to the end point of meeting its post-war needs." This shows that American industry, together with the agricultural crisis revealed by the sharp drop in grain prices last month, is moving towards the path of economic crisis. The dispatch stated that the radio manufacturing industry and the rubber manufacturing industry have successively reached the saturation point of oversupply, and the result has caused unemployment and a reduction in weekly working hours (i.e., chronic unemployment), as well as intensified competition and lower prices for new products. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. decided to reduce production by 30% at the beginning of the month. In addition, the company's male and female workers will only be able to work 28 to 30 hours per week. Other companies, such as Union Pacific Railroad, Jack & Heintz, White Motor Company, and General Electric's vacuum cleaner division, have successively laid off workers in large numbers in January and February. According to the Washington Census Bureau, the number of unemployed workers has surged in February. It is worth noting that the dispatch quoted a forecast from the steel industry publication "Iron Age" saying: "Due to weak consumer demand, the future of the steel market is quite bleak."

　　美二十万矿工大罢工
    基本工业生产已经供过于求
  　失业工人激增工作时间大减
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方讯：美国劳工战后第三度增资运动，已渐演为大罢工的形势。宾夕法尼亚等十个州的煤矿工人，一听到矿工联合会主席路易斯的通知，谓矿主已破坏了集体合同中的养老金协议（该协议规定各矿场产煤每吨收费一角，作为养老基金，以便对在矿场作工二十年，而年满六十岁者，每月付以一百元的养老金），即未待正式罢工命令，于十五日起，愤而纷纷自动罢工；并迅速自宾州蔓延至以西各州。罢工矿工迄十六日止，已超过十六万人。合众社的调查更称：全国参加罢工与怠工的矿工，已达二十万零二千一百人，占四十万矿工的半数。矿工联合会发言人预料，罢工将使煤产每日损失近五十万吨；并将使一切煤矿陷于瘫痪。厂方代表对此恐慌异常，并认为若罢工坚持十六日以上，则钢厂即须关门。
    同时，产联所属的肉类包装工人工会在资方拒绝增资要求后，不顾杜鲁门“暂缓罢工”的干涉，已于十六日午夜开始罢工。罢工由纽约开始，一小时后即波及芝加哥大屠宰中心。据工会发言人称：全国一百四十个工厂中将有十万工人参加罢工。现在卷入罢工者已将近三万人。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】纽约讯：据美联社十四日“一周商情”报导，美国基本工业的生产，“本周已更接近于满足其战后需要的终点”。显示：美国工业正与上月粮价暴跌所昭示的农业危机一起，向着经济危机之途迈进。该电称，无线电制造业与橡皮制造业已相继达到供过于求的饱和点，其结果已引起失业与每周工作时间的减少（按即慢性失业），和竞争的激烈与新产品及价格的降落。固特异轮胎公司已于月初决定减少生产百分之三十外，该公司的男女工人每周将只能做二十八到三十小时。其他如联合太平洋铁路公司、杰克与海因兹公司、怀特汽车公司、通用电气公司的真空洗尘器部，均相继于一、二月份大批解雇工人。据华盛顿户口调查局称，二月份失业工人业已激增。值得注意的是该电引钢业刊物“铁时代”的预测说：“由于消费者需求不多，钢市场的前途，颇为暗淡”。
