　　Be Cautious When Classifying Classes
　　In the past, during the movement to realize "land to the tiller" in our region, some individual cadres in some villages were very active in struggling against other landlords and rich peasants; however, they shielded landlords and rich peasants with the same surname and from the same clan, preventing the masses from struggling against them. Some leading organs, groups, and military cadres also intentionally or unintentionally shielded some landlords and rich peasants, which was all extremely wrong. However, on the other hand, in many places, classes were not carefully delineated, and class components were not carefully analyzed based on the amount of means of production occupied and the amount of exploitation of production relations. Instead, they traced back three generations, compared lifestyles, and compared personalities, and even some middle peasants and even some poor peasants were wrongly classified as landlords and rich peasants. This phenomenon must be corrected in the future. Those who have been wrongly classified must be corrected, and middle peasants who have been wrongly struggled against should be compensated. The method of class classification in Shili Township can be used as a reference for various places. Two points are extremely important: First, fully promote democracy, adopt the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three rounds of public announcement, and if there are still dissatisfactions at the end, one can appeal to the People's Court. In this way, everyone can speak boldly and engage in debates, and finally ensure that no one is wronged. Second, conduct publicity to the masses, and tell the masses the standards, conditions, and matters that should be paid attention to in class classification, so that the masses can correctly use the prescribed standards and factually analyze their own and others' class components. If these two points can be done well, coupled with correct leadership, then it is possible to correct the errors in previous class classifications and make everyone satisfied.
　　Class classification is a major issue that concerns the vital interests of the masses, and it is also an important task in the land reform and party rectification movement. When we lead the masses in carrying out this work, we must remember what Chairman Mao instructed us: "The proportion of landlords and rich peasants in the rural population, although varying from place to place, generally accounts for only about 8 percent (calculated on a household basis)." If, in our work, there is a deviation that is too large from this standard, we must carefully examine the problems in our work, find the reasons, and correct them.

### 划阶级要谨慎

　　划阶级要谨慎
    在过去我区实现耕者有其田运动中，有些村子个别干部，斗争其他地主富农时，十分积极；但对同姓同宗的地主富农，则包庇他的成份，不让群众斗争，有些领导机关、团体和部队干部，也曾有意无意的包庇了一部分地主富农，这都是十分错误的。但是，另一方面，却有许多地方，不是经过慎重划订阶级，不是按生产手段的占有多少以及生产关系剥削多少去仔细分析阶级成份，而是追三代，比生活，比人格，把中农甚至有些贫农，都被错误划成了地主富农。这种现象，今后一定要纠正，划错成份的，一定要改正过来，被误斗的中农，则应予赔偿。什里店划阶级的做法，可供各地参考，其中两点极为重要：第一、充分发扬民主，采用自报公议三榜定案的办法，并且最后如果仍有不满，还可以向人民法庭申诉。这样人人能大胆发言，进行争论，最后做到没有一个人受屈。第二，向群众进行宣传，把划阶级的标准、条件以及应注意事情，都告诉群众，这样群众便能正确运用规定标准，实事求是的去分析自己和别人的阶级成份。这两点如果能做好，再加以正确的领导，那么，就可以改正以往划阶级中的错误，使人人满意。
    划阶级是关乎群众切身利害的大事情，也是土改整党运动进行中一件重要工作。当我们领导群众进行这一工作时，必须记取毛主席所指示我们的：“地主富农在乡村人口中所占的比例，虽然各地有多有少，但按一般情况，大约只占百分之八左右（以户为单位计算）”。如果我们在工作中，发生与这一标准偏差过大时，就要仔细检查自己工作中的毛病，找出原因，加以改正。
