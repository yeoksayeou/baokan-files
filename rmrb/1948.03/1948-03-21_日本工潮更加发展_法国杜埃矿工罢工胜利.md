　　Japanese Labor Strikes Intensify
　　French Douai Miners' Strike Victorious
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese strike movement continues to develop. Even the Yomiuri Shimbun anxiously admits: "The strike situation is deteriorating." After the Tokyo telephone workers began their strike on the 11th, the strikes by Osaka government telecommunications workers and transportation workers continue to persist. Transportation workers in Shizuoka, Akita, and Fukuoka prefectures also joined the labor unrest on the 11th. The coal miners' strike is spreading rapidly. Six more coal mines from Hokkaido to Kyushu have gone on strike. On the 11th alone, 24,000 miners participated in the strike. Workers in various industries stated that if the government does not resolve their reasonable demands for salary standards and work allowances before the 15th, the strike movement will expand further.
　　The strikes have seriously hurt the Japanese reactionary authorities and capitalists. For example, after the suspension of telegram and telephone services, telecommunications between Tokyo and other cities were interrupted, causing great difficulties for stockbrokers, banks, and markets, reducing trade by half, and delaying cash payments at many banks. After the railway workers went on strike, trains were stranded on the tracks, and much freight transportation was halted.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Paris dispatch: L'Humanité reports that the 48-hour warning strike held by miners in Douai, northern France, on the 12th has been completely victorious. The miners' unions of Nord and Pas-de-Calais support the actions of the Douai miners, pay tribute to their fighting spirit, and call on them to continue to strengthen their unity and face the joint offensive of the De Gaulle and Schuman governments.

　　日本工潮更加发展
  　法国杜埃矿工罢工胜利
    【新华社陕北十八日电】东京讯：日本罢工运动继续发展，连读卖新闻也焦急地供认：“罢工情况正日趋恶化中”。东京电话工人自十一日开始罢工后，大坂政府电讯工人及交通工人之罢工仍继续坚持中，静岗、秋田、福岗各县的交通工人也于十一日卷入工潮，煤矿工人的罢工迅速蔓延，自北海道至九州间又有六处煤矿实行罢工，仅十一日参加罢工的矿工即有二万四千人。各业工人们表示：如果政府于十五日前不解决他们薪金标准、工作津贴等合理要求，则罢工运动更将扩大。
    罢工已严重打痛了日本反动当局和资本家。如电报电话工作停顿后，东京对各城市的电讯均告中断，股票经纪人、银行、市场大感困难，贸易减少了一半，许多银行均延迟付现。铁路工人罢工后，火车停置路上，许多货运均告停顿。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】巴黎讯：人道报说：法北部矿区杜埃矿工十二日举行的四十八小时警告罢工已获得完全胜利。诺尔与加莱两省矿工工会赞成杜埃矿工的行动，向他们的斗争精神致敬，并号召他们继续加强团结，正视戴高乐和舒曼政府的联合攻势。
