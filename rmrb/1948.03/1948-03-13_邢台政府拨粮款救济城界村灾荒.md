　　Xingtai Government Allocates Grain and Funds to Relieve Famine in Chengjie Village
    [Xingtai News] The famine in Chengjie Village, Xingtai, is severe (details can be found on page one of this newspaper, February 9th). After learning about this, the government allocated a sum of grain and funds, and sent people to organize relief and production. The distribution method was as follows: the entire village was divided into six groups, and councilors were selected. Then, in conjunction with cadres, they conducted interviews and investigations from all angles to understand and register all disaster victims. Afterwards, eight councilors were elected by a mass meeting to evaluate and distribute the aid. The masses were also educated to recall the famine: Who cared about us suffering in the past? This awakened the class consciousness of the masses, and many women shed tears. After four or five days of fair evaluation and discussion among the masses, reductions were made where necessary and additions were made where necessary. Sixty-two poor and hired peasant households, totaling 215 people, received 5,405 catties of grain; 30 middle peasant households, totaling 113 people, received 1,875 catties of grain. In addition, less than 3,000 catties of bran and vegetables were distributed proportionally to the grain allocation. A loan of 400,000 yuan was issued, with 376,000 yuan loaned to poor and hired peasants and 24,000 yuan to middle peasants, mainly to solve the difficulties with livestock and textile capital. The masses were also called upon to be frugal and thrifty, to overcome the spring famine and make a good job of spring sowing. After receiving the grain, poor peasant Jia Dexiang said: The government has saved us, so we must eat sparingly before the spring sowing gets into full swing. Now, the masses are either hauling manure or harrowing the land, all planning for production.
