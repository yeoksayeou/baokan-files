　　Italian Communist Leader's Election Speech
  　Calling for the Election of the Democratic Front
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] TASS, Rome, 1st: Italian Communist leader Togliatti, at the People's Democratic Front conference in Naples, delivered an election speech, calling on all genuine democrats who hope to change the current government to elect the candidates of the People's Democratic Front. Togliatti pointed out that the forces against the People's Democratic Front are trying to use the election to create chaos among the Italian people and provoke national anxiety. To answer this, the People's Democratic Front calls on democratic forces to heighten their vigilance and counter the reactionary camp. Togliatti continued: On the eve of the April general election, the Italian people are conducting the same struggle as before the June 2, 1946 election, against the same enemies, to win the same victory. The Italian people now demand the right to independent life and oppose the capitalist and landlord ruling class seizing power and national wealth for themselves. Togliatti pointed out that after the victory in the June 1946 general election, even the most reactionary elements in Italy had to admit that they could not control the Italian people's democratic movement, which is why they are resorting to other tricks. Togliatti firmly stated in his concluding remarks that the victory of the People's Democratic Front in the April general election will guarantee Italy's independence and cooperate with all other countries on an equal footing.

　　意共领袖竞选演说
  　号召选举民主阵线
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社罗马一日电：意共领袖托格里亚蒂在那不勒斯人民民主阵线大会上，发表竞选演说，号召一切期望改变现政府的真正民主分子，选举人民民主阵线的候选人。托氏指出：反人民民主阵线的势力，正力图利用竞选，在意国人民中制造混乱，并挑起国家的惶恐不安。人民民主阵线为了回答它，号召民主势力提高警觉，反击反动阵营。托氏继称：意国人民在四月大选前夕，和一九四六年六月二日选举前一样，进行同样的斗争，反对同样的敌人，以赢得同样的胜利。意国人民现在要求独立生活的权利；并反对资本家和地主统治阶级把权力与国家财富攫为己有。托氏指出：在一九四六年六月大选胜利后，即使意国绝顶的反动分子，也不得不承认：他们控制不了意国人民民主运动，这就是他们要采取另外一种伎俩的原因。托氏在结语中坚称：人民民主阵线在四月大选中的胜利，将保证意大利的独立；并站在平等地位与一切其他国家合作。
