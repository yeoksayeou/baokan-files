　　The Uprising of the Provisional 58th Division

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th dispatch] Frontline reporter Jiang Cun reported on the uprising of the Kuomintang army Provisional 58th Division in Yingkou, stating: At the grand welcome meeting held by the Liaonan Military Region for the uprising of the Provisional 58th Division, the reporter met Wang Jiashen, the division commander who led the uprising. Commander Wang told the reporter that he had previously held illusions about Chiang Kai-shek, but after seeing Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule heading towards its doom over the past two years, and that the Northeast People's Liberation Army was about to succeed, and that national victory was not far off, he was unwilling to sell his life for the Chiang bandits. When our army launched an attack on Yingkou on February 25th, Commander Wang immediately convened an emergency meeting of officers above the battalion level of the division, pointing out the current situation, saying: "The Beining Railway has now been cut off, and Liaoyang and Anshan have fallen. Yingkou is completely isolated and in extreme danger... There are only three paths before us: the first is to hold on and wait for reinforcements, but there is no hope of reinforcements, and holding on will inevitably lead to complete annihilation; the second is to break through, but this is fundamentally impossible; the other is to revolt, break away from Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and join the Liberation Army..." Deputy Division Commander Tang beside him immediately said: "I also agree with the division commander's opinion." However, some officers still raised questions: Would the Liberation Army "want us?" After Commander Wang explained, "I have already made contact," they said: "We have long had this idea as well." So they immediately decided to act and arranged the uprising.

　　The division's young adjutant, Han Guangzhi, took advantage of the fact that 28 reactionary ringleaders of the Chiang bandits, including Zheng Mingxin, the deputy commander of the Chiang bandit's 52nd Army, and the Chiang bandit party and government in Yingkou City, were holding a meeting to discuss Yingkou's defense, and led his troops into the meeting, holding guns and detaining them all. At this time, Zheng Mingxin deliberately started crying, trying to soften Adjutant Han, saying: "I cherish you very much..." Adjutant Han replied angrily: "Stop saying nice things, if you cherish us, you will send our ten thousand people to their deaths!" At that time, gunshots rang out everywhere in the city, and the reactionary organs such as the municipal government police station were quickly disarmed. More than fifty of the most reactionary military police secret agents lived in the Xingya Building, and they were still resisting stubbornly. After two hours of fierce fighting, they were also eliminated. Another unit of Commander Wang's also began to make contact with the puppet traffic police, and suddenly the two sides fought fiercely. The unit fired two flares into the air as a signal, and a unit of our Liaonan immediately rushed into the city and attacked the traffic police headquarters from the west, while the uprising troops attacked from the east. By dawn the next day, the uprising troops had eliminated a large detachment of the puppet traffic police, and the Liberation Army had annihilated more than a thousand traffic police. The uprising of the Provisional 58th Division was thus a glorious victory, cooperating with our army to liberate Yingkou City, an important port in Liaodong Bay.

　　暂五八师起义经过
    【新华社东北八日电】前线记者江村报导营口蒋军暂五十八师起义经过称：记者在辽南军区举行的暂五十八师起义盛大欢迎会上，会见了领导该师起义的王家善师长。王师长对记者说：他过去曾对蒋介石抱着幻想，但经过两年来看到蒋介石的反动统治已走向日暮途穷，东北人民解放军就要成功，全国的胜利也为期不远时，因此他已不愿替蒋贼卖命。当二月二十五日我军向营口发动攻击后，王师长即召开该师营以上军官紧急会议，指出当时的处境说：“现北宁路已被切断，辽阳、鞍山已经陷落，营口完全处于孤立，且已万分危急了……摆在面前的只有三条路：第一是固守待援，但援军无望，固守必遭全歼；第二是突围，但这根本不可能；另一条便是起义，脱离蒋介石的统治，参加解放军………”在旁的唐副师长即说：“我也同意师长的意见”。不过有的军官仍提出疑问：解放军是否“要咱呢？”可是经王师长说明：“我已经联络好了”后，他们便说：“我们亦早就有这个意见”。于是当即决定行动，布置起义。
    该师青年副官韩光志，即趁着蒋匪五十二军副军长郑明新及营口市蒋匪党政等二十八名反动首脑人员正在开会讨论营口的防务时，便率部持枪而入，将其全部扣押。此时郑明新故意哭起来，企图软化韩副官说：“我很爱护你们……”韩副官愤怒的回答：“不要再说漂亮话了，你再爱护就把我们这万把人送到死路上去了！”当时市内已到处响起枪声，市政府警察所等反动机关迅速被解除了武装，兴亚大楼楼上住着五十多个最反动的宪兵特务，还负隅顽抗，经两小时激烈战斗也被解决了。王师另一部亦和伪交警开始接触，顿时双方战争颇烈，该部即向上空打了两颗作为信号的照明弹，我辽南某部立刻冲入市内，从西面攻击交警总队，起义部队则从东面夹击，至次日拂晓起义部队解决了伪交警一个大队，解放军亦将千余交警全部歼灭，暂五十八师的起义遂获得光荣的胜利，配合我军解放了辽东湾要港营口市。
