Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 23rd. The powerful second-line corps of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, having completed rigorous military and political training, are now swearing oaths and heading to the front lines. Since the corps were formed last autumn, mainly from emancipated peasants, they have launched an unprecedented large-scale winter training campaign in accordance with the military region's educational policy of "technology as the main focus, tactics as a supplement, and the close integration of the two." The military regions of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang, and Nenjiang first conducted preliminary investigations into motivation (for joining the army), background, and physical condition, as well as general grievance education. They then entered a heatwave of arduous training in the four major skills (shooting, grenade throwing, bayonet fighting, and demolition). The vast numbers of emancipated soldiers in each corps, in order to strive to complete the predetermined training tasks, overcame various difficulties, disregarded the severe cold, and worked hard day and night. In just over two months, many companies were able to achieve speed and accuracy in shooting, distance and accuracy in grenade throwing, and strength, agility, and endurance in bayonet fighting. Some of the slower-progressing squads, platoons, and soldiers quickly caught up with the average level as a result of mutual teaching, mutual learning, and mutual competition. At the beginning of the training, the leadership promptly prevented and corrected the remaining bureaucratic and warlord styles of some cadres, so that the democratic movement under centralized leadership could be universally carried out. Many companies therefore eliminated dead corners in training and transformed backward elements. In conducting various technical and tactical drills, each corps attached great importance to connecting them with battlefield experience. Many companies first conducted collective research and discussions by cadres before starting each subject, and then gradually implemented it. In the squads and platoons, they adopted more practice, more action, and repeated exercises to achieve "unity of learning and application" in teaching and training. Some also launched "evaluate learning" and "evaluate teaching" movements, quickly exchanging various experiences and overcoming shortcomings in a timely manner, making the entire educational process extremely smooth. In mid-December last year, the technical training of each corps came to an end, and they entered grievance and land reform education. The "Manifesto of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and the "Land Law Outline" were repeatedly explained and discussed. Among the cadres, a Party rectification study was carried out from top to bottom, and strict struggle was waged against certain deviations from the Party line and non-proletarian ideologies and styles through criticism and self-criticism. After this movement, many units not only became more consolidated and united, but also further improved their class viewpoint and policy level. After completing the above training, each corps requested to go to the front to kill the enemy. The troops of the North Manchuria Military Region have solemnly sworn an oath a few days ago and are heading to the front line.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 23rd. In recent days, people from all walks of life in the North Manchuria Liberated Area have been joyfully seeing off the second-line corps on their expedition, and have launched a warm consolation movement. When the troops of the Heilongjiang and Nenjiang Military Regions gathered in a certain place to swear an oath, it was amidst the spring snow. Representatives from various places braved the severe cold and brought consolation gifts to congratulate them. The heroic soldiers passed through the cheering crowds and entered the venue. Director Gui of the corps explained to the elders present that the significance of swearing an oath to go on an expedition was to cooperate with the fraternal troops on the front line and fight for the liberation of the entire Northeast. Yu Yifu, Speaker of the Nenjiang Provincial Council, encouraged all commanders and fighters to bravely advance, saying that the democratic government and the masses would take care of their families, so they did not need to worry. The masses in Mudanjiang also warmly saw off a certain corps when they swore an oath. The representatives cordially wished the commanders and fighters more meritorious service for the people. When the corps set off, the masses formed more than 30 yangko dance teams to see them off. When a certain corps in Songjiang set off, representatives from various organs and groups in Harbin went to comfort them. Farmers in the suburbs alone donated 500,000 yuan in banknotes, 1,200 catties of pork, and many other items such as towels and soap. Before a certain corps in Hejiang set off at the beginning of the month, it held a military-civilian get-together with thousands of representatives from all walks of life in Jiamusi City in the railway station square. When the unit boarded the train, the representatives lined up to see them off on the platform, shouting: "We wish you more prisoners and more captured weapons, and that you will march all the way into the Pass!"

　　东北解放军第二线强大兵团
  　完成整训誓师赴前线
    春雪纷飞中各省人民热烈慰劳欢送
    【新华社东北二十三日电】东北人民解放军第二线强大兵团于完成严格的军政训练后，现已纷纷誓师开赴前线。各兵团自去秋以翻身农民为主体组成后，即按照军区以“技术为主，战术为辅，使两者密切结合”的教育方针，掀起了空前规模的冬季大练兵。合江、松江、牡丹江、黑龙江、嫩江各军区，首先进行了初步的查动机（参军动机）、查出身、查体格，及一般诉苦教育，旋即进入苦练四大技术（射击、投弹、刺杀、爆破）的热潮，各兵团的广大翻身战士，为了争取完成预定的整训任务，克服种种困难，不顾天气严寒，日夜进行苦修苦练，不到两个多月，许多连队即已做到射击的快与准，投弹的远与准，以及刺杀的有力敏捷持久。若干进步较慢的班排及战士，由于互教互学与互相竞赛的结果，亦很快的赶上平均的水准。在练兵开始时，由于领导上及时防止并纠正了某些干部的官僚主义与军阀主义的残余作风，使在集中领导下的民主运动得以普遍开展，很多连队并因此消灭了练兵的死角，改造了落后分子。各兵团在进行各种技术与战术教练上，对于战场经验的联系均十分重视，许多连队在每一课目开始时，均先通过干部的集体研究讨论，然后逐步实施。在班排里则采取多练多作与反复演习，以求得教与练的“学用一致”，有的并开展了“评学”“评教”运动，迅速交流了各种经验，及时克服了缺点，使整个教育的进程极为顺利。去年十二月中旬，各兵团的技术教练告一段落，即进入诉苦及土改教育，对“中国人民解放军宣言”及“土地法大纲”，均作了反复的讲解及讨论，在干部中则开展从上而下的整党学习，以批评与自我批评的方式，对某些离开党的路线及非无产阶级的思想作风作了严格的斗争，许多部队经过这一运动，不但更加巩固与团结，而且进一步提高了阶级观点及政策水平。各兵团完成上述训练后，即纷纷请求上前方杀敌，现北满各军区部队，已于日前隆重誓师，开赴前线。
    【新华社东北二十三日电】连日来北满解放区各界人民以极兴奋之心情，欢送第二线兵团出征，并发起热烈慰劳运动。黑龙江及嫩江两军区部队于某地集中誓师时，正值春雪纷飞，各地代表冒严寒携带慰劳品前往庆贺。英武的子弟兵团通过夹道欢呼的人群，进入会场后，该兵团桂主任，向全场父老说明誓师出征意义是协同前线兄弟部队，为解放全东北而战。嫩江省参议长于毅夫勉励全体指战员勇往直前，家庭有民主政府和群众照顾，不必挂心。牡丹江群众亦于某兵团誓师时热烈欢送，各代表均亲切预祝指战员多为人民立功。当该兵团出发时群众组成三十多个秧歌队送行。松江某兵团出征时，哈尔滨市各机关、团体均派代表前往慰劳，仅近郊农民即捐献流通券五十万元，猪肉一千二百斤，其他毛巾、肥皂等甚多。合江某兵团月初出发前曾与佳木斯市各界数千代表，在火车站广场上举行军民联欢大会。该部登上火车时，各代表列队至月台欢送，高呼：“祝你们多捉俘虏，多缴枪，一直打进关内去！”
