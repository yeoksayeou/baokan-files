Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 25th: Frontline reporters reported on the Battle of Zhoucun, stating: On the 12th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army, braving the rain and after 18 hours of fighting, captured Zhoucun City, the command center of the Jiang bandits on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. They decisively and thoroughly annihilated more than 15,000 enemy troops, including the entire 32nd Division (missing two regiments and three battalions) and the 14th Security Regiment, achieving the first victory of decisive significance in the spring offensive. After undergoing a new-style military consolidation movement last winter, involving speaking bitterness, rectification, and military training, the People's Liberation Army universally improved its class consciousness and confidence in storming fortifications. Before attacking Zhoucun this time, commanders at all levels personally organized meticulous terrain inspections and studied sand tables with the soldiers, implementing military democracy to concentrate the entire army's fighting will and overcome the difficulties of marching and fighting in the rain, and correctly and suddenly launch the battle. When the Zhoucun garrison faced the threat of annihilation, the bandit 141st Brigade headquarters, originally stationed in Changshan, led two battalions (1st and 3rd) of the 422nd Regiment and the pseudo-Changshan County Brigade; the bandit 421st Regiment, originally stationed in Zouping and Qidong cities; and the bandit New 36th Brigade headquarters, originally stationed in Bucun (70 li southwest of Zhoucun), leading the 107th Regiment, rushed to Zhoucun for reinforcement on the afternoon of the 11th, throwing themselves into the net. The People's Liberation Army quickly closed the reserved gap in the encirclement that evening, preparing to capture the turtles in a jar. At 4:00 AM on the 12th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack, opening eight breakthrough points within half an hour. The Changsheng (Ever Victorious) Company of a certain regiment first broke through the northeast corner of the city in just twelve minutes. Other units also successively broke into the city from the Guanhai Gate in the east and the Zhongzheng Gate in the southeast, engaging the enemy in street fighting. By 10:25 AM, they had completely controlled the northeast corner of the city, including the Electric Company and the Flour Company, and rapidly expanded westward. At this time, our troops on the western front had also occupied the Wusheng Gate and entered the city. The enemy's deployment was unstable and, attacked from both sides, they panicked, and their command was thrown into chaos. The 2nd Battalion of a certain unit of ours first eliminated the New 36th Brigade headquarters, capturing more than 500 prisoners. Under our encirclement and political calls, enemy troops laid down their weapons by companies and platoons. Another unit of ours simultaneously advanced south, annihilating most of the enemy in the Wangjia Hutong of the Yishun Gate, capturing more than 1,000 prisoners, and joining forces with our southern forces. By 1:00 PM, the enemy had been divided into northern and southern sections. After our fierce artillery suppression and political offensive, the enemy who retreated to the Bianjia Hutong in the northern part of the city were completely eliminated, while the enemy trapped in the southwestern part of the city all surrendered. The entire battle ended victoriously at 10:00 PM.
