　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. TASS, New York, 18th. American progressives have fiercely criticized Truman's speech. Wallace, the Third Party presidential candidate, said: This is a call for a new mobilization of the world and the organization of a police state in the United States, and also a frank admission of the complete failure of the Truman Doctrine. Progressive Senator Taylor said he opposed Truman's plan. He said: The Soviet Union is currently demobilizing, but we are going to mobilize and implement military measures. "That will be the end of freedom and the establishment of a militaristic state in the United States." New York Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio said: Truman has foolishly carried out the tasks entrusted to him by his "warlord and banker colleagues," and his speech cannot deceive the American people. He said: Truman's approach, although hateful, also has a tragic side, because it endangers world peace. Another Labor Party Congressman, Isaacson, said: "Truman is trying to frantically cover up the shameful failure of the Truman Doctrine with a war crisis; and is attempting to get re-elected by this means. In order to conceal the bankruptcy of his policies, and his failure to stop inflation, protect the people's freedom, and achieve genuine peace, he is therefore suggesting the militarization of the United States." Truman's speech has even caused anxiety among many conservatives in the United States. Congressman Short said: "I think this has created a lot of hysteria." Associated Press reporters reported that some Republicans hinted that Du was "creating a crisis" for electoral gain.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. New York News: "Truman's speech will inspire millions to rise up and fight for peace," This is the unanimous call of American democratic public opinion while angrily condemning Du's speech. The Workers Daily said: "The President presented the nation with a completely fabricated crisis. No one abroad is threatening the United States. The danger comes from a small group of speculative bankers and soldiers on Wall Street." It also said: "Washington demands the right to send weapons to any place in the world where so-called internal aggression occurs, that is to say: to places where the people vote to choose democracy and socialism. It is afraid of the coming economic crisis; and wants to win the election and defeat the Third Party with rumors of a war crisis." The newspaper concluded: Millions of Americans should join the Third Party to fight for peace.
　　The New York branch of the Progressive Citizens Association issued a statement saying that the purpose of Du's speech was to create fear among the people and make them accept police state measures. The statement concluded: Washington's war makers will never succeed. Du's speech will attract countless supporters for Wallace's platform. Isaacson's recent election to Congress is enough to show what kind of policies the people need. The American Slavic Congress also telegraphed Truman on the 18th, accusing his speech of being a man-made war cry, violating the United Nations Charter, and being the final proof of the US government's militaristic policy. The telegram ended by saying: The American people cannot unite on this policy basis to maintain the weak Greek dynasty or the corrupt Chiang Kai-shek regime. We oppose your proposal and will fight for friendly cooperation among democratic countries.

　　杜鲁门捏造战争危机　只是无耻的竞选伎俩
    美国民主舆论怒斥杜鲁门演说
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】塔斯社纽约十八日电：美进步人士猛烈抨击杜鲁门演说。第三党总统候选人华莱士说：这是要全世界实行新动员与在美国组织警察国家的呼号，也是杜鲁门主义完全失败的坦白承认。进步参议员泰勒说他反对杜鲁门的计划。他说：苏联目前正在复员，我们反而要动员，而实行军事措施，“那将是自由的完蛋与在美国建立一个军国主义的国家”。纽约工党众议员马肯托尼奥说：杜鲁门已愚蠢地实行其“军阀和银行家同僚”所付托给他的任务，他的演说骗不了美国人民。他说：杜鲁门搞这一套，虽然可憎，但也有可悲的一面，因为它危害世界和平。另一工党议员伊萨克逊说：“杜鲁门力图以战争危机来疯狂地掩盖杜鲁门主义可耻的失败；并企图借此得到连任。为了掩饰他政策的破产，和他未能制止通货膨胀、保障人民自由与获得真正和平，他于是建议把美国军国主义化”。杜鲁门演说，甚至在美国许多保守人士中，亦引起了焦虑，众议员肖特说：“我认为这是制造了许多歇斯特里”。美联社记者报导，若干共和党人暗示：杜是为了竞选利益而“制造危机”。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】纽约讯：“杜鲁门的演说将激起千百万人起来为和平而奋斗”，这是美国民主舆论在怒斥杜氏演说时的一致呼声。工人日报说：“总统向国家提出一个彻头彻尾捏造的危机。国外没有人在威胁美国，危险倒是来自华尔街一小撮投机的银行家和军人。”又说：“华盛顿要求有权把武器送到世界上任何发生所谓内部侵略的地方，即是说：送到人民投票选择民主和社会主义的地方去。它害怕正在到来的经济危机；并想以战争危机的谣言来赢得选举，击败第三党。”该报结语称：千百万美国人应参加第三党为和平而战。
    进步公民协会纽约分会发表声明说：杜氏演说的目的，在于造成人民的惶恐，使人民接受警察国家的措施。声明结语称：华盛顿战争制造者决不会成功。杜氏演说将为华莱士政纲招来无数的支持者，伊萨克逊最近的选入国会，足以说明人民是需要那一种政策。美国斯拉夫人大会十八日亦致电杜鲁门，斥其演说为人造的战争叫嚣，违反联合国宪章，并且是美政府军国主义政策的最后证明。该电末称：美国人民不能团结在这种政策基础上，来保持衰弱的希腊王朝或腐败的蒋介石统治。我们反对你的建议，并将为民主国家的友谊合作而奋斗。
