　　On the Party Spirit of Economic Workers in Their Work
　　Moscow Secretary Zuo Erning
　　The Bolshevik Party has spent much effort in educating Soviet economic worker cadres. Their profound thinking and boundless loyalty to the cause of socialist construction are the most valuable and decisive qualities of these cadres. Soviet economic workers, educated in the Bolshevik spirit, base all their work on wholeheartedly serving the interests of the state and the people. The early completion of production tasks is, for factory managers, technicians, workshop directors, and skilled workers, a source of great spiritual satisfaction. Advanced Bolshevik economic workers are not satisfied with the general completion of plans; they put all their energy, their practical experience, and the efforts of the collective into not only fulfilling but exceeding the state's plans and reducing production costs.
　　The Bolshevik Party spirit of economic workers lies in the fact that they are never satisfied with the achievements already made; they constantly discover unsolved tasks before them, do not stand still, but move forward. This characteristic is inherent in our people.
　　The Soviet people's irresistible will to achieve new achievements is reflected in the results of socialist competition. This can be seen from the example of Moscow and the Moscow region. The enterprises of the region exceeded the May plan, and their production increased by 23 percent compared with the same period last year. On June 15, nearly five hundred enterprises completed their June tasks ahead of schedule. The miners of the Moscow region overproduced tens of thousands of tons of coal in five months, exceeding the plan. The collective farmers of the region exceeded the grain sowing plan and completed the planting of potatoes and vegetables.
　　The characteristic of Soviet economic workers is that they do not seek an "easy life"; on the contrary, they enjoy vigorous activity. Their Party spirit lies in the fact that they never drift with the tide but stubbornly advance against difficulties, seeking and discovering the path of progressive movement.
　　The leaders of the Krasnokholm Textile Replication Factory certainly belong to this category of people. The workers of this factory declared their hope and readiness to complete the year's plan ahead of schedule. But in order to achieve this goal, it was necessary to implement many serious measures: strictly improve production skills, improve the technological process, establish and install new combined dyeing and washing machines in production, set up mechanized transfer of products during preparation, and organize transportation with conveying devices. The leaders of the replication factory and the Party organization estimated that the real implementation of these measures not only made it possible to generally exceed the plan but also created practical conditions for completing the Five-Year Plan in four years. After the installation of new machinery and the expansion of the factory began, as a result, they were able to produce so much textile every day, a quantity that had been planned to be achieved only by 1950.
　　Soviet economic leaders do not separate themselves from the enterprise as a whole, and this is how our industrial achievements are attained. They consult with technicians and advanced workers, try their best to support and encourage creative people, and summarize and apply the rich experience of Stakhanovites.
　　Comrade Matrosov, a cutting worker at the "Paris Commune" factory, rationalized his work and achieved a high labor productivity, greatly exceeding pre-war indices, but his personal achievements did not satisfy him. He knew that the labor productivity of many workers in the workshop was not high. Comrade Matrosov proposed formulating a plan for the widespread adoption of advanced labor methods to ensure that the productivity of each worker would increase. The value and characteristics of Comrade Matrosov's proposal lay in the fact that he not only proceeded from personal interests (his labor productivity guaranteed him a high wage) but also wished to obtain conditions under which backward workers could catch up with the level of advanced workers.
　　Comrade Litman, the manager of the "Paris Commune" factory, and Comrade Churusova, the secretary of the Party organization, treated Vasily Matrosov's proposal in the spirit of the Party. They supported Matrosov's initiative, helped him study his proposal, absorbed the entire staff of the factory to pay attention to this matter, and, in implementing Comrade Matrosov's initiative, raised the labor productivity of many backward workers to the level of advanced workers. With the help of the Party organization and publications, the "Paris Commune" factory regarded Matrosov's initiative as an asset for our entire country.
　　When we speak of the Party spirit of economic workers in their work, we are referring to the leading cadres in industry, who not only generally strive to exceed plans but also adopt new technologies and the most advanced technological methods for this purpose.
　　Party organizations have the mission to constantly educate Soviet economic workers in the spirit of a deep understanding of the tasks facing economic workers. To treat matters in the Bolshevik spirit, irreconcilability with inertia and conservatism, constant efforts to strive for new and higher technological heights, and the maximum increase in product output flow organically from the daily responsible national work of Soviet workers.
　　One of the outstanding qualities of a Bolshevik economic leader is a sensitive concern for the needs of workers, technicians, and staff in his enterprise. In enterprises that take good care of the needs of the collective, we can often see achievements in work.
　　However, regrettably, there are also leaders who are detached from the workers, do not know their needs, and workers find it difficult to see such leaders and difficult to get the necessary help from them. And the work of such economic workers is usually not done well.
　　The Merkichi factory, where Comrade Gorsunov serves as manager, has frequently failed to complete its production plans. This factory should manufacture carriages for the Moscow subway, but, although the deadlines set by the government have long passed, the subway has not received a single carriage.
　　In this factory, there is no Bolshevik system, and the main thing is the absence of a Party attitude toward people. In winter, workers have to work in cold workshops, and when workers return to the public dormitory, there are no basic conditions for rest. The public dormitory is cold, crowded, and dirty. Economic and Party leaders despise the needs of the workers and do not care about them.
　　A true Bolshevik should regard it as an honor when the Party entrusts him with caring for the needs of the working class. Soviet economic workers should combine the problems of technology and organization of production with the daily struggle to improve the material living conditions of workers and staff.
　　The Lenin-Stalin Party educates the cadres of Soviet economic workers in the spirit of loyalty and honesty to the state.
　　Our economic workers put the interests of the state above all else. Unfortunately, among economic workers, there are also personnel who try to hide the capabilities of the enterprise, set the plan too lightly, sometimes take the path of deception, write unfinished products into finished products just to get bonuses, and so on. There are also economic workers who do not consume raw materials and data sparingly but try to receive raw materials and data in advance beyond the scope of real needs. For the sake of personal comfort, they keep huge amounts of material valuables in warehouses, and they make exaggerated statements to planning agencies on equipment and so on. These selfish economic workers lack the Party's understanding of the interests of the Soviet state. Like short-sighted petty merchants, they cannot see things a little further than their noses and live only for narrow local interests and their own personal interests. Although there are not many of these people, they must be resolutely exposed, criticized, and educated in the spirit of national interests. Only leaders who act in their own actions based on national interests can be competent.
　　Soviet economic workers cannot confine themselves to the circle of merely production interests. The broader his political vision and the better he can analyze domestic and international events, the more serious, conscious, and profound he will be in solving production problems. Factory managers have the mission to educate their subordinate cadres on a daily basis and develop their sense of patriotic duty. Only when an economic worker is a person with sufficient political education, only under this condition, can he fulfill such a mission. Constantly engaging in improving one's ideological and theoretical level and truly mastering Bolshevism - this is the necessary responsibility of a Bolshevik economic worker. The post of manager, workshop director, regardless of the size of the production leader - is also a Party post at the same time.
　　The Party spirit of economic workers in their work is a necessary quality for Soviet leaders. It should always accompany the activities of economic workers, and it should become the key to solving tasks large and small. Only under such conditions, under the conditions of political education and Marxist-Leninist training, will Soviet economic workers be able to stand firm in their posts.

　　论经济工作者在工作中的党性
    莫斯科书记  左尔宁
    布尔塞维克党花费了许多精力，来教育苏维埃经济工作者干部。他们对社会主义建设事业的深邃思想和无限忠诚，便是这些干部最宝贵和决定的品质。受过布尔塞维克教育的苏维埃经济工作者，把自己的全部工作，建筑在全心全意为国家和人民利益服务的基础上。生产任务的先期完成，对于工厂经理、技师、车间主任、技工说来，乃是他们高度精神上的满足。先进的布尔塞维克经济工作者，并不满足于计划之一般完成，他将自己的全部精力，自己的实际经验和集体的努力，放在不仅完成而且超过国家的计划，并减低生产费上。
    经济工作者之布尔塞维克党性，就在于他绝不满足于既得的成果，他经常在自己面前发现尚未解决的任务，不固步自封，而是向前进展。这一特点是我们人民所固有的。
    苏维埃人对获取新成就之难于抑止的意志，反映在社会主义竞赛的结果中。这从莫斯科和莫斯科州的例子可以看出。州的企业超过了五月计划，其生产品较去年同期增多百分之二十三。在六月十五日，差不多有五百个企业先期完成了六月份任务。莫斯科州的矿工在五个月内超过计划而多产了数万吨煤。州的集体农民们超过了谷物播种计划，完成了马铃薯和菜蔬的种植。
    苏维埃经济工作者的特点，在于他不图“安闲的生活”，相反的，他乐于沸腾的活动。他的党性在于他决不随波逐流，而是顽强地逆着困难而前进，寻找和发现进步运动的道路。
    克拉斯诺霍姆纺织复制工厂领导者，确属于这一类人物。这一工厂的工人声明希望和准备先期完成一年的计划。但为了达到这一目的，就必须实行许多严重的措施：严格提高生产修养，改善技术过程，建立和安置生产中的新的联合染洗机，设置准备产品时的机械化的转递，组织有传送装置的运输。复制工厂和党组织的领导者估计，这些措施的真正实现，不仅有了一般地超过计划的可能，而且为在四年中完成五年计划创造了实际的条件。新机械的装置和工厂的扩充开始之后，结果，他们能够每昼夜出产这样多的纺织品，这个数量曾经筹划只有到一九五○年才能完成。
    苏维埃的经济领导者不把自己与企业的整体分开，由此来达到我们工业上的成就。他们与技师们、先进的工人们商量，尽量支持和鼓励有创造性的人们，总结与运用斯达哈诺夫者的丰富经验。
    “巴黎公社”工厂的裁切工人马特洛索夫同志，他使自己的工作合理化，并取得高度的劳动生产率，大大超过了战前的指数，但这一个人的成就没有满足他。他知道车间许多工人的劳动生产率不大。马特洛索夫同志提议制订一个广泛采用保证使每个工人生产率增高的进步劳动方法的计划。马特洛索夫同志建议的价值和特点，在于他不仅是从个人利益（他的劳动生产率保证他高度的工资）出发，而且愿望取得这样的条件，在这些条件下，落后的工人能够赶上先进工人的水平。
    “巴黎公社”工厂的经理立特曼同志和党组织书记楚鲁索瓦同志，用党的精神对待瓦西里·马特洛索夫的建议。他们支持了马特洛索夫的倡议，帮助他研究其建议，吸收工厂的全体人员来重视这个事情，并且在实现马特洛索夫同志的倡议下，使许多落后工人的劳动生产率提高到先进工人的水平上。“巴黎公社”工厂在党的组织与刊物的帮助下，把马特洛索夫的倡议当作我们全国的资产。
    说到经济工作者在工作上的党性，我们所指的是工业上的领导干部，不是一般地努力于超过计划，而是为此而采用了新技术与最完善的工艺学的方法。
    党的组织负有使命，以深刻了解摆在经济工作者面前的任务的精神，来经常地教育苏维埃的经济工作者。以布尔塞维克的精神来对待事情，对疲蹋与保守的不可调和性，对争取新而又新的技术高度的经常努力，产品出产的尽量增加，从苏维埃工作者日常负责的国家工作中有机地流溢出来。
    布尔塞维克——经济领导者的出色品质之一，就是对自己企业中工人、技师、职员的需要之敏感的关切。在很好关怀集体需要的企业中，我们经常可以看到工作上的成就。
    然而，可惜，也还有这样的领导者，他们脱离工人，不知道他们的需要，工人很难谒见这样的领导者，并且从他那里难以得到必要的帮助。而这种经济工作者的工作，照例总是搞不好的。
    戈尔素诺夫同志担任经理的墨基其工厂，经常的没有完成生产计划。这个工厂应当为莫斯科的地道电车制造车厢，但，虽然政府所规定的期限早就过去了，地道电车连一个车厢都没有接到。
    在这个工厂里，没有布尔塞维克的制度，而主要的是对人没有党的态度。冬天工人们不得不在冰冷的车间里工作，而工人回到公共宿舍时，也没有起码的休息条件。在公共宿舍里又冷，又挤，又脏。经济和党的领导者蔑视工人的需要，不关心他们。
    真正的布尔塞维克当党委托他关心工人阶级的需要时，应认为是光荣的事。苏维埃的经济工作者应把技术、组织生产的问题与为改善工人与职员的物质生活设施的日常斗争配合起来。
    列宁——斯大林党，以对国家的忠诚与老实的精神，来教育苏维埃经济工作者的干部。
    我们的经济工作者，把国家的利益提得高于一切。可惜，在经济工作者中也有这样的人员，他们力图隐瞒企业的能力，把计划定得轻松些，他们有时走上欺骗的道路，他们仅仅是为了获得奖金，而把未制成的产品写到制成品中去等等。也有这样的经济工作者，他们不是节约地消费原料和资料，而是力图预先领取超过真正需要范围的原料和资料。他们为了个人的安逸，在仓库里保存着各种巨额的物质贵重品，他们在装备等等上对计划机关作了夸大的声明。这些自私自利的经济工作者，没有苏维埃国家利益的党的认识。他们象缩手缩足的小商人一样，看不到离鼻子稍远的事情，并且只为狭隘的本位利益和自己个人利益而生活。虽然这种人不多，但要坚决揭露、批评和以国家利益的精神来教育他们。只有在自己行动上由国家利益出发的领导者，才能称职。
    苏维埃的经济工作者不能把自己闭塞在仅仅是生产利益的圈子里。如果他的政治眼光愈远大，愈能更好地分析国内与国际事件，那么他在解决生产问题上会更严肃，更觉悟，更深刻。工厂经理负有使命日常教育其下属的干部，发展他们爱国义务感。经济工作者只有在自己是一个有足够政治教育的人，只有在这个条件下，才能完成这样的使命。经常从事提高自己的思想理论水准，真正精通布尔塞维克主义——这是布尔塞维克经济工作者的必须的责任。经理、车间主任，不论大小的生产领导者的岗位——这同时也是党的岗位。
    经济工作者在工作中的党性，是苏维埃领导者所必须有的品质。它应当经常伴随着经济工作者的活动，它应当成为解决大小任务的钥匙。只有在这样条件下，在政治教育与马列主义的锻炼的条件下，苏维埃的经济工作者才会站稳自己的岗位。　　　　　　　　　　　（伊译自一九四七年六月十八日的“真理报”）
