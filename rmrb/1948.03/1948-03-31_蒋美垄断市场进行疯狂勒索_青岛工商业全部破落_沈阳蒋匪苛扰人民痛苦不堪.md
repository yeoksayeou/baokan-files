　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to a Tianjin newspaper report from the 10th of this month, a dispatch from Qingdao stated: Under the evil rule of Chiang and the US, the city's private industry and commerce are almost entirely bankrupt. In terms of industry, apart from the "state-run enterprises" of the Song Ziwen faction, namely the various China Textile factories, and the "Party-run enterprises" of CC Zeng Yangfu's Qilu Company, which are able to survive by using their "special powers," the remaining small and medium-sized private industries are on the verge of complete collapse. Last year, an average of 43 factories closed down each month. In January of this year, all of the more than 700 factories in the city that used a significant amount of electricity were completely shut down. However, the Chiang bandit authorities are still carrying out insane extortion, with business taxes having been increased by 150%, and various other levies having been increased by two or three times. Various businesses and shops are also closing down one after another because they cannot bear the burden. Only a portion of the commercial market that is taking "special paths" is showing a distorted "prosperity." These types of businesses are already using US dollars to mark prices, and US currency is circulating like water. If someone stands on the street for just one minute, someone will come to "buy" or "sell" to you. The Weixian Road intersection has already become an open market for buying and selling US dollars. The Chiang and US bandit gangs are creating the darkest of evils in this "modernized" city. Incidents such as Chiang and US military police raping women, murdering and arson, sheltering gambling dens, and extorting money are constantly occurring.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: According to a compilation of Tianjin newspaper reports from late last month, news from Shenyang stated: The Northeast Chiang bandits have stipulated that 150,000 conscripts will be seized this year. In name, all young and middle-aged people between the ages of 18 and 45 are eligible to be conscripted, but in reality, regardless of age or whether they are only sons, all are to be seized. The people of Shenyang are in a state of anxiety, hiding day and night. In addition to the cities, the Chiang bandits are also seizing conscripts, carts, and horses in villages near strongholds, demanding food and drink. Carts and mules for civilian use have been forcibly occupied. Today they are requisitioned to transport mistresses, and tomorrow they are seized to transport ammunition. Farmers not only lose their carts and horses but also have to send someone to drive the cart. Chiang's soldiers are spreading the word: "Beat up the rice, curse the white flour, but don't beat or curse the millet porridge." They oppress the common people everywhere, and the people cannot bear the suffering. In the prosperous Taiyuan Street area of Shenyang, eight out of ten shops have closed down, stalls are lined up, and there are few customers. The Chiang bandit currency continues to depreciate. At that time, 150,000 only exchanged for one million in legal tender (according to Chiang's authorities, the ratio of "circulating currency" to "legal tender" was increased to one to ten this month). Sorghum rice has risen to 10,000 in circulating currency per catty (equivalent to 660,000 in (Chiang's) legal tender at that time), rice is nearly 100,000 "legal tender" per catty, American flour is 4 million per bag, and pork is 200,000 per catty. The vast majority of citizens can no longer maintain their livelihoods.

　　蒋美垄断市场进行疯狂勒索
  　青岛工商业全部破落
    沈阳蒋匪苛扰人民痛苦不堪
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据本月十日津报载青岛通讯：该市在蒋美罪恶统治下，民间工商业几已全部破落。工业方面，除宋匪子文的所谓“国营事业”中纺各厂及ＣＣ曾养甫的“党营事业”齐鲁公司各厂利用其“特殊势力”尚能支持外，其余中小民营工业已处于全部倒闭危机。去年全年平均每月工厂倒闭数达四十三家，今年一月全市使用电力较大的工厂七百余家则全部停工歇业。但蒋匪当局尚疯狂进行勒索，营业税已加了一倍半，其他各种摊派也两倍、三倍的加起来。各业商号因不堪负担，亦纷纷倒闭，只有走着“特种路子”的一部分商业市场则呈现着畸形的“繁荣”，这类商号已用美金标价，美钞已似流水般的通行着，只要有人在街头站上一分钟，就有人来向你“买”或“卖”，潍县路口则已成买卖美钞的公开市场。蒋美匪帮正在这个“现代化”的城市里制造着最黑暗的罪恶，蒋美军警宪强奸妇女、杀人放火、包庇赌局、敲诈勒索等类事件，不断发生。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合上月下旬天津报纸载沈阳消息：东北蒋匪规定今年抓丁十五万，在名义上凡十八岁到四十五岁的青年中年均在被征之列，实则不论年龄，不管独子单丁一律要抓。沈市人民惶惶不安，日夜躲避。除城市外，蒋匪更到据点附近乡村抓丁、抓车、抓马、要吃要喝；民用的大车骡马均被强占，今天征去拉太太，明天抓去运弹药，农民不仅损失了车马，还要赔送一个赶车的人。蒋军流传着：“打大米、骂白面，不打不骂小米饭。”到处欺压老百姓，人民不堪其苦。沈阳繁华的太原街一带，商店十家有八家倒闭，地摊林立，顾主寥寥。蒋匪流通券不断贬值，当时十五万仅换法币百万（按本月间蒋匪已提高“流通券”与“法币”比率为一比十）；高粱米每斤已涨至流通券一万（合当时（蒋）法币六十六万元），大米近“法币”十万元一斤，兵船面粉四百万一袋，猪肉二十万一斤，广大市民均已不能维持生活。
