　　Working People Who Have Mastered Marxism
  　Are Changing Their Destiny Through Victorious Struggle

　　This week, working people all over the world warmly welcomed their festival of great historical significance - the centennial anniversary of the birth of the "Communist Manifesto." One hundred years ago, on February 27th, the great teachers of the world's working people - Marx and Engels - published the "Manifesto" for the liberation of the proletariat and mankind. At that time, capitalism was still in a period of upward development, and there were only Marx and Engels and a few of their comrades-in-arms as the world's communists. But one hundred years later, "it is already the century of communism," and the world's communists number in the tens of millions. "The ideas of the 'Communist Manifesto' have been grasped by hundreds of millions of people and have become the greatest material force changing the fate of our planet" (Pravda). And capitalism is on the verge of destruction, engaging in futile death throes. (Associated Press)

　　The people of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and other peace-loving countries celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Army this week. This is not only because the great Soviet Army has made immortal contributions to mankind by eliminating the German and Japanese fascist beasts, but also because it stands at the forefront of progressive forces, fighting for democracy and peace, and is the guardian of the security of all countries. The unparalleled strength of the Soviet Army declares to the world that the power of the working people who have mastered Marxism can never be defeated. The Soviet people once again declared on the festival: "Resolutely follow a policy of peace, while never forgetting the war-mongers' preparations for a new war," and warned foreign adventurers who dare to invade the Soviet borders that their attempts will surely be defeated and crushed by the heroic Soviet Army.

　　The Czech people, armed with Marxism, achieved a victory of great international significance this week. Under the direct command of the US and British consulates, the upper-level reactionary traitors of the Czech National Socialist Party, the Catholic People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party launched a wave of creating rebellion on the 20th. Considering that the National Front is increasingly developing into an alliance of all democratic forces in the country; considering the growing prestige of the Czech Communist Party among the masses; fearing that the upcoming general election would be unfavorable to them; and fearing that the Gottwald government's strong actions against saboteurs and foreign spies would expose their own relationship with the enemies of the republic abroad; therefore, they attempted to force President Beneš to dissolve the parliament by resigning from the cabinet, and then take the opportunity to implement an armed coup and return Czechoslovakia to reaction. But the Czech people and their vanguard - the Communist Party - were not only angered by the reactionaries' conspiracy, but also showed unparalleled calmness, courage, and determination in the face of the incident. After the ministers of the three reactionary parties submitted their resignations on the 20th, 200,000 people gathered in Prague on the 21st to protest the conspiracy to undermine the republic. On the 22nd, 2.5 million workers and staff held a representative conference, and the cry of "Long live the new Gottwald government!" resounded through the sky. At the same time, National Front Action Committees were formed throughout the country, and mass cleansing movements against reactionaries began everywhere. The three reactionary parties also split, and reactionary leaders fell one after another. Under these circumstances, Beneš finally "respected the wishes of the people" and accepted the proposal of the Czech Communist Party. In just one week, the Czech people decisively extinguished the conspiracy of domestic and foreign reactionaries to rebel. This victory of the Czech people made the British and American authorities feel like they were sitting on pins and needles, because the "last bastion of Western concepts" in Central and Eastern Europe against the Soviet Union and communism, which they sought, was gone forever. The US authorities' immediate announcement of "controlling exports to Czechoslovakia, stopping loans, and freezing Czech assets in the US" proves how heavy a blow they suffered this time.

　　The establishment of the unified Workers' Party in Romania and the 20th National Congress of the British Communist Party are equally significant. The Romanian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party decided at a joint representative conference on the 24th to formally merge the two parties into the Workers' Party, based on Lenin and Stalin's concept of establishing a new type of party. From then on, the possibility of reactionaries using the division of the working class to undermine the new democratic construction of Romania was finally eliminated, and Romania's democratic life and economic construction will enter a new stage.

　　The 20th National Congress of the British Communist Party, which lasted for four days, closed on the 24th. This conference was held in a situation where the British economic crisis has deepened, the Labour Party has increasingly divided Europe and undermined the labor movement, and 4.5 million organized workers in the country have risen to fight against freezing wage levels, and the British Communist Party has achieved significant victories in the re-election of trade unions across the country. In his concluding speech on policy issues on the 22nd, British Communist Party Executive Committee member Gollan firmly believed that the time for mass movements was ripe, pointing out that the central issue for the British Communist Party at present is to launch mass movements to achieve the goal of changing the government. In the future, the British Communist Party will unite the broad masses of the British people and strive to realize the slogan put forward by the conference: "Oppose the Labour Party's right-wing government" and strive for the establishment of a left-wing government.

　　掌握马克思主义的劳动人民
  　正在改变自己命运胜利斗争
    在本周内，全世界劳动人民热烈迎接其具有伟大历史意义的节日——“共产党宣言”诞生一百周年纪念。一百年前的二月二十七日，世界劳动人民的伟大导师——马克思与恩格斯，发表了解放无产阶级及人类的“宣言”，当时，资本主义还处在向上发展的时期，世界上的共产党人，还仅仅只有马、恩两位先哲及其少数战友而已；可是一百年后的今天，“已是共产主义的世纪”，世界的共产党人，数以千万计；“‘共产党宣言’的思想，已经为千百万人民所掌握，并成为改变我们地球命运的最伟大的物质力量”（真理报）。而资本主义则已处在毁灭的边缘，进行徒劳无益的垂死挣扎。（美联社）
    苏联、东欧及其他爱好和平各国的人民，本周前夕，曾狂欢庆祝苏军卅周年纪念节，这不仅因为伟大的苏军，曾为人类作了不朽的供献，消灭了德日法西斯野兽，而且是因为它站在进步力量的最前线，为民主和平而斗争，是各国安全的卫士。苏军的无比强大，向世界宣告了：掌握马克思主义的劳动人民的力量，是永远不可被战胜的。苏联人民在节日再次宣布：“坚决遵循和平政策，同时无论如何片刻也不忘记战争贩子对新战争的准备”，并警告敢于侵犯苏联边疆的外国冒险者，其企图将一定被英勇的苏军所打败和粉碎。
    为马克思主义所武装的捷克人民，在本周内取得了有重大国际意义的胜利。在美英总领馆直接指挥下，捷克民族社会党、天主教人民党及斯洛伐克民主党的上层反动叛国分子，于二十日掀起了制造叛敌的阁潮，他们鉴于民族阵线日益向全国一切民主力量的联盟发展；鉴于捷共在群众中声望的增长；害怕行将到来的大选对他们不利；害怕哥特瓦尔德政府对破坏分子及国外间谍采取的有力行动，会暴露出他们自己与国外共和国公敌的关系；因此他们企图以辞职倒阁来迫使贝奈斯总统解散国会，然后乘机实行武装政变，使捷克回到反动。可是捷克人民及其先锋队——共产党，不仅因反动派的阴谋而愤怒，而且在事变面前表现了无比的镇静、勇敢和坚决。二十日三反动政党各部长提出辞职后，二十一日布拉格即有二十万群众集会，抗议破坏共和国的阴谋，二十二日，二百五十万工人与职员召开代表大会，“哥特瓦尔德新政府万岁！”的呼声，响彻云霄，与此同时，全国各地组成了民族阵线行动委员会，到处开始了群众对反动派的清洗运动，三反动政党内部亦随之分裂，反动领袖纷纷倒台。在此情况下，贝奈斯最后“尊重人民的愿望”，接受捷共建议。二十五日哥特瓦尔德新政府就宣告成立了。捷克人民仅在一周内，即如快刀斩乱麻似地一举扑灭了国内外反动派叛乱的阴谋。捷克人民的这一胜利，使得英美当局如坐针毡，因为它们所企求的中东欧反苏反共的“西方观念之最后一个堡垒”，是从此一去不复返了。由美国当局之立即宣布“要管制对捷输出，停止贷款，冻结捷在美资产”等，就可以证明他们这一次所受打击是如何的沉重。
    罗马尼亚统一的工人党的建立与英共第二十届全国代表大会，同样有着巨大的意义。罗共与社会民主党于二十四日联席代表大会上决定，宣布两党正式合并为工人党，而以列宁斯大林关于建立新型政党的概念为基础。从此，反动派利用工人阶级的分裂而进行破坏罗国新民主建设的可能，是最终地被排除了，而罗国的民主生活与经济建设则将踏入一个新阶段。
    英共第二十届全代大会开会四天，于二十四日闭幕。这次大会是在英国经济危机更加深重、工党分裂欧洲及破坏工运日亟、而国内四百五十万有组织的工人已起而为反对冻结工资水平展开斗争和英共在全国各工会改选中获得重大胜利的情况下召开的。英共执委高兰在二十二日关于政策问题的总结性发言中坚信，群众运动的时机已经成熟，指出英共当前的中心问题就是开展群众运动，以达成改变政府的目的。今后英共将团结英国广大的人民，为实现大会提出的口号：“反对工党右翼政府”和争取左翼政府的建立而斗争。（新华社）
