Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 5th. In the first offensive operation of the Northwest People's Liberation Army into the KMT-controlled areas, two divisions and four brigades of Hu bandit elite troops were completely annihilated, with an overwhelming force. Since the Jiang-Hu bandits' attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in March of last year, the Northwest People's Liberation Army, after six months of interior-line operations, fundamentally changed the situation in the Northwest battlefield, creating favorable conditions for the PLA to shift from defense to offense, from interior-line to exterior-line operations, and to expand the liberated areas. After winter training, the troops' morale to kill the enemy was unprecedentedly high, and the tactical command was flexible and mobile. After holding departure rallies in mid-February, the troops marched south in several routes. On the 22nd, the main force penetrated into the Yichuan County area from various routes, and the stubborn KMT local bandits fled in disarray upon hearing the news. Wherever our army went, the masses welcomed us on both sides of the road. On the 24th, a part of our army directly approached Yichuan City and surrounded it. The Hu bandits hastily mobilized the 53rd Brigade and 61st Brigade of the reorganized 90th Division, the elite troops stationed in the central area, and the 31st Brigade and 47th Brigade of the reorganized 27th Division stationed in the Luochuan area. Bandit chief Liu Kan, commander of the reorganized 29th Army, led a lightly armed force to reinforce them, advancing cautiously and closely along the way. On the 28th, the bandit army advanced to the Baijiazhuang and Waxuejie areas, 30 li southwest of Yichuan, and was intercepted by a part of our army. That night, a part of our main force braved the severe cold and heavy snow, detoured to the enemy's rear, occupied Waxuejie, and attacked the enemy's tail. At the same time, another part of our main force completely controlled the surrounding highlands, gradually compressing the stubborn enemy into more than ten small areas, at which point the enemy fell into chaos. At 11:00 AM on March 1st, the People's Liberation Army launched a full-scale general attack, and after six hours of fighting, by 5:00 PM, the enemy was completely and thoroughly annihilated. Bandit chief and army commander Liu Kan and division commander Yan Ming were both killed.

　　宜川大捷经过
    【新华社西北前线五日电】西北解放军挺进蒋管区的首次攻势作战中，全歼胡匪精锐部队两个师四个旅，势如排山倒海。自蒋胡匪去年三月进攻陕甘宁边区后，西北解放军经过六个月的内线作战，即根本改变了西北战场的形势，造成解放军由防御转入进攻，由内线作战转入外线作战，扩大解放区的有利条件。又经过了冬季整训，部队杀敌情绪空前高涨，战术指挥机动灵活。二月中旬各部举行出征誓师大会后，即分路南下。廿二日大军从各路挺入宜川县境，沿途蒋顽土杂望风逃窜。我军行军所至，群众夹道欢迎，二十四日我军一部直逼宜川城下，将该城包围。胡贼仓皇调集驻中部一带的精锐部队整编九十师之五十三旅及六十一旅，驻洛川一带的整编廿七师之三十一旅及四十七旅，并由匪首整编二十九军军长刘戡率领轻装来援，沿途小心翼翼，并拢前进。该匪军二十八日进至宜川西南三十华里的白家庄、瓦学街地区，即遭我军一部阻击。是夜我主力一部乃冒严寒大雪，绕至敌后，攻占瓦学街，尾敌攻击。同时我主力另部将敌周围高地完全控制，将顽敌逐渐压缩于十余处狭小地区内，至此敌即呈混乱状态。三月一日上午十一时，解放军发动全面总攻，经六小时战斗，至下午五时当将敌全部彻底干净歼灭。匪首军长刘戡、师长严明均被击毙。
