Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Communist Party leader Tokuda Kyuichi delivered a speech at the Nagoya Communist Party branch meeting on the 13th, believing that the Ashida Cabinet would be short-lived. He pointed out, "The current cabinet is a patchwork government created by the conspiracy of Democrat Ashida and Socialist Nishio." (Meaning pieced together from broken fragments) and predicted that it would inevitably collapse within half a year. Tokuda also put forward the JCP's policy, saying: If the JCP were to come to power, it would stop inflation and eliminate the black market through the nationalization of the Industrial Bank.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: The JCP's Akahata newspaper exposed the reactionary nature of the current Japanese cabinet, saying: The main task of the Ashida government is to implement policies that conform to the interests of monopoly capital behind the smoke screen of the Democratic Party bosses' machinations. Ashida has already emphasized "the necessity of rebuilding foreign credit" in his first declaration. To this end, the cabinet will pursue a policy of lowering workers' living standards, increasing capitalists' profits, intensifying exploitation, and laying off workers on a large scale. Behind the "democratic" mask, the Ashida Cabinet will pursue the policies put forward by monopoly capitalists that the previous Katayama Cabinet failed to fully implement. As for the Ashida Cabinet granting the Socialist Party and the People's Cooperative Party certain positions, its purpose is to have them defend the cabinet from attacks by the masses. Akahata newspaper concluded: This kind of means cannot deceive the working people, and they will resist the government more strongly.

　　日共领袖德田球一指出
  　芦田内阁寿命不长
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】东京讯：日本共产党领袖德田球一，十三日在名古屋共产党支部会上发表演说，认为芦田内阁将是短命的。他指出“现内阁是民主党人芦田和社会党人西尾阴谋造成的补绽政府。”（意即拼凑破片而成）并预言它在半年内必然垮台。德田并提出日共的政策说：日共如能执政，将制止通货膨胀，并经由工业银行的国有化而消灭黑市。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】日共赤旗报揭露日本现内阁的反动性质说：芦田政府的主要任务，就是在民主党头子们权术的烟幕后，执行符合独占资本利益的政策。芦田在第一次宣言中已强调“重建国外信用的必要性”，为此目的，内阁将奉行降低工人生活标准、增加资本家利润、加紧剥削和大批解雇工人的政策。芦田内阁将在“民主”的假面具后面，奉行独占资本家所提出的，而前片山内阁未能完全实现的方针。至于芦田内阁给予社会党和国民协同党以某些地盘，其目的在使他们保卫内阁，以免受群众的攻击。赤旗报最后说：这种手段，骗不了劳动人民，他们将更坚强的反抗政府。
