　　Tokyo Foreign Correspondents
  　Oppose US Military Authorities' Control of News
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Tokyo dispatch: The Special Committee of Allied Correspondents here has sent two lengthy letters to the US Commission on Freedom of the Press and MacArthur's headquarters, respectively, opposing MacArthur's suppression of news reporting through "erroneous methods." The letters severely criticize MacArthur's headquarters for controlling and censoring news under the pretext of "military secrets," and for strictly blocking sources of information to control or interfere with journalists' methods of handling news. The letters cite facts to illustrate that MacArthur's headquarters, on the pretext that a certain reporter's report was "nitpicking," had the US Army Criminal Investigation Division search the reporter's home and interrogate and threaten the reporter. The occupying authorities also widely used the term "military secret" to expel journalists, and at least nine journalists have been subjected to such intimidation. Under the guise of "military secrets," reporters are prohibited from reporting information on all aspects of Japanese crimes, war criminals, cleansing statistics, reparations, decentralization of Japanese economic power, industrial recovery, and US dollar loan negotiations. Journalists who collect this news are also persecuted and intimidated. The letters state that if journalists stationed in Japan abide by all the regulations of the authorities, they will have no choice but to remain silent.

  　反对美军当局统制新闻
    【新华社陕北六日电】东京讯：此间各盟国记者特别委员会，以长信两份，分别送交美国新闻自由委员会及麦氏总部，反对麦克阿瑟以“谬误之方法”，箝制新闻之报导。信中严厉抨击麦氏总部借口“军事秘密”控制和检查新闻，和严密封锁消息来源，以控制或干涉记者对处理新闻的方法。信中列举事实说明麦氏总部借口某记者报导为“吹毛求疵”，美陆军刑事侦察组即搜查该记者的住宅；并盘问威胁该记者。占领当局又广泛利用“军事秘密”一词，以驱逐新闻记者，至少已有九名记者受到此种恫吓。而在“军事秘密”名目之下，记者对日人罪行、战犯、清洗统计、赔偿、分散日本经济势力、工业复兴及美元贷款谈判等各方面的情报，均不准报导。收集这些新闻的记者，还受到迫害与恫吓。信中说：如果驻日记者都遵守当局的一切规章，他们只好缄口无言。
