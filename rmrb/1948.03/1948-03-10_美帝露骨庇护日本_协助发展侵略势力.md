　　U.S. Imperialism Shamelessly Shelters Japan
  　Assists in Developing Aggressive Forces
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th】 Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai Da Gong Bao reported on December 16th of last year, citing a Shin-A Agency Tokyo dispatch, that Japanese people have made various demands to the United States regarding the restoration of overseas shipping. The U.S. Department of the Navy has therefore sent a study mission to Japan and South Korea, led by former Naval Committee Assistant, Colonel Sharon. On the same day, the paper also carried a United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 14th, saying that "World Report" magazine's Tokyo sources and other sources in Washington pointed out: "Because U.S. authorities cannot determine standards, the plan to destroy Japan's pre-war monopolistic enterprises has been repeatedly delayed, and Japan's development towards free enterprise has now stagnated." The newspaper's Tianjin edition editorial on December 19th also stated: "The United States' direction of Japan has become increasingly blatant recently, with words and actions without any scruples." In the words of Lieutenant General Eichelberger, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army and commander of ground forces stationed in Japan: "Japan is a reservoir of friendship for the United States, and will be able to stop any enemy attempting to attack the United States in the future." Because of this, Class A war criminals have been successively released from Sugamo Prison. Furthermore, 54 American diplomats jointly submitted a document to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, defending Shigemitsu Mamoru. The United States requested the Far Eastern Commission to postpone the dissolution of Japanese zaibatsu, and also suggested reducing the amount of Japanese reparations. Since the opening of Japanese trade, monthly exports have increased, and fourteen more commercial ports will be opened next year (this year), bringing the total to fifty-six ports. Because there are not enough merchant ships, the United States sent Colonel Sharon as the head of a delegation to specifically assist in the recovery of Japanese maritime transport. The Strike Plan retains Japan's industry as the leading one in the Far East. Strike, representing the Army, went to Japan for inspection. In reality, he is the manager of an American overseas construction company and has dispatched a group of experts to Japan to assist in improving Japan's shipbuilding technology. The newspaper also stated: "The boldest and most frightening thing is that Japan is about to rebuild its army." Based on the revival of Japanese militarism, this newspaper, which supports Chiang Kai-shek and his master Truman, cannot help but admit that Japan is "following in the footsteps of Siam" and "advancing on the road to tragedy."

　　美帝露骨庇护日本
  　协助发展侵略势力
    【新华社陕北八日电】沪讯：上海大公报去年十二月十六日载新亚社东京电称：日人对恢复海外航运问题，已向美国提出种种要求，美国海军部为此已派出一考察团赴日、韩考察，由前海军委员会助理沙伦上校为团长。同日该报又载合众社华盛顿十四日电说：美国“世界报告”杂志东京消息及华盛顿其他方面消息均指出：“由于美国当局不能确定标准，故摧毁日本战前独占事业之计划，已一再迟延，目前日本向自由企业之发展已趋停顿”。该报天津版十二月十九日社评亦称：美国对日本之导演，近来越做越露骨了，言论行动都毫无顾忌，拿美国第八军军长兼驻日地上部队总司令艾契堡中将的话说：“日本为美国友谊的储藏所，将来当能阻止企图攻击美国的任何敌人”。就因为这样，甲级战犯已陆续由巢鸭监狱释放出来。还有美国外交官五十四名联名呈文远东国际法庭，为重光葵辩护。美国请求远东委员会延缓解散日本财阀，又建议减低日本赔偿的数量。日本贸易开放以来，输出月有增加，明年（今年）将再开放十四个商港，连前有共为五十六港，商船不够，美国派沙伦上校作为代表团团长，专门协助日本海运复员。斯揣克计划保留日本工业居远东首位，斯氏代表陆军赴日考察，实际他是美国国外建筑公司的经理，曾派遣一群专家到日本协助提高日本的造船技术。该报又称：“最大胆也是最可怕的，是日本又要重建军队了。”根据日本军国主义复活的情形，这个拥护蒋介石及其主子杜鲁门的报纸，不能不承认日本正在“步暹罗的后尘，”“同往恶剧的道路前进。”
