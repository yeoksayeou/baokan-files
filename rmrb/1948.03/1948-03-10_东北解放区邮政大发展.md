　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th. The postal service of the Northeast Liberated Area has greatly developed in the past year. Comparing January of last year with December, the number of post and telecommunications bureaus in the entire area increased from 125 to 290, the number of agency offices increased from 104 to 480, postal routes increased from 6,551 kilometers to 13,554 kilometers, and the number of mail items increased from 193,000 to over 1,570,000. The number of newspapers issued in various regions increased twentyfold. Delivery is fast, with land routes improving threefold and railway postal delivery improving sevenfold. Recently, the Northeast Postal Administration Bureau convened a postal work conference for the entire Northeast Liberated Area to discuss better development of this people's undertaking. It was decided that the future direction would be to integrate postal services, transportation, and distribution, with postal services reaching out to rural areas, serving the war, and serving the people. In the first half of this year, postal organizations from the county to the district level should be universally established in various regions, so that all villages and hamlets in the Northeast Liberated Area can see newspapers in a timely manner. Land route postal workers are the basic force in postal work, and the leadership must better mobilize them, rely on them, and appropriately improve their living conditions so that they can further improve their work.

    【新华社东北八日电】东北解放军邮政事业一年来已有很大发展。去年一月与十二月相较，全区邮电局由一百二十五个增至二百九十个，代办所由一百零四处增至四百八十处，邮路从六千五百五十一公里增加到一万三千五百五十四公里，邮件从十九万三千件增加到一百五十七万余件，各地报纸发行的份数则增加了二十倍。邮递迅速，旱路提高三倍，铁路邮递提高七倍。最近东北邮政管理总局特召开全东北解放区邮政工作会议，讨论更好的发展这一人民事业，当确定今后的方针为：统一邮政、交通、发行三者为一体，邮政业务应该走向农村，服务战争，服务人民。今年上半年各地应普遍建立由县到区的邮政组织，以便逐渐做到全东北解放区各村屯都能即时看到报纸。各地旱路邮工人员是邮政工作中的基本力量，领导上必须更好的发动他们，依靠他们，并适当的改善他们的生活待遇，使他们进一步提高业务。
