Taihang District Party Committee Issues Decision
　　Consolidate Party Rectification Results
　　Establish Party Day System
　　[Taihang News] In order to consolidate the results of the Party's reorganization, the Taihang District Party Committee publicly issued the "Decision on Establishing a Party Day System" on the 5th of this month. The main points are as follows: (1) Since the Central Bureau convened the district-wide land conference in October last year, most of the Party cadres at and above the district level in our district have undergone the first reorganization. Although this reorganization has achieved preliminary results, it is not yet consolidated, because this reorganization is only from top to bottom. Every comrade must continue to go to the masses and into the strict organizational life of the Party for training and testing. In the future, there will be another reorganization from bottom to top. (2) We have also gained an important lesson in this reorganization - that is, due to the serious relaxation and abandonment of our Party's organizational life and Party discipline in the past, many comrades committed errors that could not be corrected in time, and even their errors changed from small to large, from light to heavy, and even developed to the point of being incurable. In order to consolidate the results of the reorganization, we must improve the Party's organizational life and strengthen the Party's iron discipline. (3) In order to prevent the Party Day system from becoming a formality, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out correctly. We must oppose liberalism and reconciliationism. On the day of the Party Day, leaders and those being led can criticize each other, as long as it is a matter of principle, it is permissible to have debates within the Party.

　　太行区党委发布决定
  　巩固整党成果
  　建立党日制度
    【太行消息】太行区党委为巩固整编党的成果，本月五日特公开发布“建立党日制度的决定”，要点如下：（一）自去年十月中央局召开全区土地会议以来，我区区以上各级各系统的党员干部，大多数都已经过了第一次的整编。这次整编虽取得了初步的成绩，但还不够巩固，因为这次整编，还只是自上而下的，每个同志，还必须继续到群众中去，到党的严格的组织生活中去锻炼与考验，将来还要自下而上的进行一次整编。（二）我们在这次整编中，还获得了一条重要的教训——就是由于过去我们党的组织生活，和党的纪律，严重的松懈与废弛，而使得许多同志，犯了错误不能得到及时的纠正，甚至使其错误，由小变大，由轻变重，以至发展到不可救药的程度。为要巩固整编的成果，就必须健全党的组织生活，并加强党的铁的纪律。（三）为要使党日制度，不致流为形式，必须正确的开展批评与自我批评。必须反对自由主义与调和主义。在过党日的那一天，领导者与被领导者之间，都可以互相批评的，只要是原则问题，是容许在党内展开争论的。
