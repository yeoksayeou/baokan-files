　　The Soviet Intelligence Agency published an important document from February 9th to 16th, "The Falsifiers of History." Excluding the preface, it is divided into four parts. The following is a summary broadcast. ——Xinhua News Agency

　　Part Two: Not Struggling Against German Aggression, But Pursuing a Policy of Isolating the Soviet Union.

　　Later developments made it clearer that the British and French ruling groups were making concessions to and conniving with the Axis fascist states, encouraging and inciting Germany towards aggression. German Foreign Ministry documents captured by the Soviet army showed that the purpose of British and French policy was to isolate the Soviet Union and divert the aggression of the Hitlerite gang eastward against the Soviet Union.

　　When the U.S. government released the German archives, it deleted the documents of the Munich Agreement. This shows that the U.S. government is also keen to whitewash the heroes who played the role of betrayal in Munich, and to blame the Soviet Union. Documents in the German Foreign Ministry archives show how the fate of some countries was manipulated; how Britain and France encouraged the aggression of the Hitlerite gang and tried to divert the aggression eastward against the Soviet Union.

　　For example, the record of the meeting between Hitler and British Lord Privy Seal and later Foreign Secretary Halifax (German Foreign Minister Neurath was also present) in Obersalzberg on November 19, 1937, is sufficient to prove this. At that time, Halifax declared: "He (Halifax himself) and other members of the British government are fully aware that the Führer has not only made great achievements within Germany, but has also destroyed communism in other countries and blocked the road of communism to Western Europe. Therefore, Germany has the right to be praised as the bastion of anti-Bolshevism in the West." Halifax also suggested on behalf of the British government that Britain and France should support the "Berlin-Rome Axis." When Hitler expressed his criticism of the Treaty of Versailles, Halifax hurriedly replied: "The British are realists, and they may be more convinced than others that the errors of the Treaty of Versailles need to be revised. In the past, Britain often used this realistic view to exert its influence." He was referring to Britain's role in the early withdrawal from the Rhineland, the settlement of reparations, and the German reoccupation of the Rhineland. After agreeing to continue negotiations with Hitler, Halifax declared: "The core of all other issues is related to changing the European order, and changes may occur sooner or later. These issues are Danzig, Austria, and Czechoslovakia." This was a secret agreement between the British government and Hitler to sacrifice third parties to satisfy Hitler's appetite for annexation.

　　In the German Foreign Ministry documents, there is also a record of Hitler's meeting with the British Ambassador to Germany Henderson on March 3, 1938: Ribbentrop was also present. Henderson, on behalf of the British government, emphasized: "This is not a commercial negotiation, but an attempt to establish a foundation for sincere friendship between Britain and Germany, starting with improving the current situation and leading to a new spirit of friendly understanding." Henderson expressed that he did not object to Hitler's demands for "excluding the Soviet Union and unifying Europe," and said that he himself had often expressed his support for German annexation. Immediately after that negotiation, Hitler seized Austria on March 12, 1938, without encountering opposition from Britain and France.

　　At that time, only the Soviet Union issued a warning, and once again appealed for the organization of a collective security system to safeguard the independence of countries threatened by aggression. The British government replied to the Soviet Union's note to various countries on March 17, calling for stopping aggression: The British government believes that a conference to take concerted action against aggression is not necessarily beneficial to the future of European peace.

　　Another link in Germany's aggression and preparation for the European war was Germany's seizure of Czechoslovakia.

　　On July 10, 1938, the German Ambassador to Britain, Dirksen, reported to Berlin: "One of the most important items of British policy is to seek a compromise with Germany." The British government "has increasingly understood the main points of Germany's main demands, which is to prevent the Soviet Union from determining the fate of Europe, and to prevent the Soviet Union from participating in the League of Nations, or from reaching the desire to conduct bilateral negotiations and treaties with other countries."

　　On September 19, 1938, four days after the Berchtesgaden meeting between Hitler and Chamberlain, representatives of the British and French governments demanded that the Czechoslovak government cede the Sudetenland to Germany. On September 20, the Czechoslovak government said in its reply to the British and French proposals: "Accepting such proposals would be tantamount to completely dividing the country," "The paralysis of Czechoslovakia would result in profound changes in the politics of the entire Central and Southeast Europe," "The balance of power in Central Europe and the entire Europe would be disrupted; that would have consequences for all other countries, especially France." The next day, the British government issued an ultimatum to Czechoslovakia, demanding that it withdraw its reply to the British and French proposals, threatening the Czechoslovak government: "If British advice is rejected, then the Czechoslovak government is free to take any steps it deems beneficial to the development of the situation."

　　From September 29 to 30, 1938, Hitler, Chamberlain, Mussolini, and Daladier finally concluded the evil secret pact at the Munich Conference. Czech representatives were only invited to Munich to obediently await the consequences of the imperialists' conspiracy. The treacherous actions of Britain and France were by no means a temporary shift in policy, but a crucial aspect of their policy. The purpose of this policy was to incite Hitler's aggressors against the Soviet Union.

　　The Soviet Union had openly declared its willingness to fulfill its obligations under the Soviet-French-Czech Mutual Assistance Treaty to support Czechoslovakia against Germany. However, France refused to fulfill its obligations. After handing Czechoslovakia over to Germany, the British and French governments rushed to sign broad political agreements with Hitler's Germany. The Anglo-German Declaration was signed by Chamberlain and Hitler in Munich on September 30, 1938. The declaration stated: "Anglo-German relations are extremely important for both our countries and Europe. We believe that the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement symbolize that our two nations are determined never to fight each other." The French-German Declaration of Bonnet and Ribbentrop was signed in December 1938. The declaration stated: "French-German peace and good neighborly relations are essential to consolidating European relations and maintaining universal peace. Therefore, the two governments will do their utmost to ensure the maintenance of this relationship between them." These were non-aggression declarations between Britain and Germany, and France and Germany.

　　These agreements, in essence, meant that Britain and France had signed non-aggression treaties with Hitler. These agreements showed that in order to get rid of the threat of Hitler's aggression against their own countries, the British and French governments believed that the Munich Agreement and other similar agreements were opening the door for Hitler's bandits to invade eastward towards the Soviet Union. The political condition of "unifying Europe" (excluding the Soviet Union) was thus established. What they were pursuing was complete isolation of the Soviet Union.

　　历史的伪造者
    苏联情报局
    苏联情报局于二月九日至十六日公布之“历史的伪造者”重要文件，除序言外，共分四部分，兹摘要播发。　　　　　　——新华社　　　
    第二部分：不对德国侵略作斗争，而奉行孤立苏联的政策。
    后来事情的发展，更清楚地说明了：英法统治集团是对轴心法西斯国家让步和纵容，鼓励和煽动德国走向侵略，苏军所缴获的德国外交部文件，说明了英法政策的目的在于孤立苏联，把希特勒匪帮的侵略，扭转东向反对苏联。
    美国政府在公布德国档案时，删去了慕尼黑协定的文件，这说明美国政府也热心为扮演慕尼黑叛卖行为的英雄们粉饰，而来责难苏联。德国外交部档案里的文件说明了：一些国家的命运怎样被玩弄；英法怎样鼓励希特勒匪帮的侵略，努力使侵略扭转东向反对苏联。
    例如：一九三七年十一月十九日，希特勒和英枢密大臣后任外交大臣的哈里法克斯（德外长牛赖特也在座），在欧伯萨尔兹堡的会谈记录，便足证明。当时哈里法克斯宣称：“他（哈本人）和英国政府其他阁员，充分知道，元首不仅在德国内部有了巨大成绩，而且已经摧毁了别国内的共产主义，拦断了共产主义伸向西欧的道路，因此，德国有权被推崇为西方反布尔塞维主义的堡垒。”哈里法克斯并代表英国政府建议英法应支持“柏林——罗马轴心。”在希特勒表示对凡尔赛条约的非难时，哈里法克斯赶忙答辩说：“英国人是现实主义者，他们也许比别人更深信凡尔赛条约的错误有修改的必要。在过去，英国经常用这种现实主义的见解去施展它的影响”。他所指的，是英国在提前撤出莱茵区，解决赔偿问题和德国重占莱茵区等问题中的作用。哈里法克斯在与希特勒同意继续商谈后，声称：“其他一切问题的核心，都与改变欧洲秩序有关，变更迟早可能要发生。这些问题就是但泽、奥地利和捷克斯洛伐克。”这是英国政府和希特勒在进行秘密协定，牺牲第三者来满足希特勒吞并的胃口。
    德国外交部文件中，还有一九三八年三月三日希特勒与英驻德大使汉德生会谈的记录：李宾特洛甫也在座。汉德生代表英政府强调说：“这不是商业谈判，而是企图为英德真诚友谊建立基础，由改善目前形势开始，一直到建立友好谅解的新精神为止。”汉德生表示并不反对希特勒“排除苏联、统一欧洲”的要求，他说他自己经常表示他是赞成德与合并的。在那次谈判之后，希特勒立即于一九三八年三月十二日夺取了奥国，而没有遇到英法方面的反对。
    那时，只有苏联一国发出警告的呼声，并再度提出呼吁，号召组织集体安全制，以维护受侵略威胁的各国的独立。英国政府对于苏联三月十七日向各国所提阻止侵略的照会，答复说：英国政府认为，采取一致行动以反对侵略的会议，并不一定对欧洲和平前途有利。
    德国侵略与欧战准备的另一环节，是德国夺取捷克。
    一九三八年七月十日，德驻英大使德尔生向柏林报告：“英国政策最重要项目之一，就是与德国寻求妥协，”英国政府“已日益了解德国主要要求的要点，就是使苏联不能决定欧洲的命运，使苏联不能参加国联，也不能达到与其他国家作双边谈判及缔约的愿望。”
    一九三八年九月十九日，希特勒与张伯伦在贝兹加登会议后四天，英法政府代表就要求捷克政府将苏台德区割给德国。九月二十日，捷克政府在答复英法建议中说：“接受那种建议，就等于使国家完全四分五裂，”“捷克的瘫痪，结果会使整个中欧与东南欧政治发生深巨变化，”“中欧及整个欧洲的均势会被破坏；那将使其他一切国家，特别是法国蒙受其后果。”第二天，英国政府通牒捷克，要求它撤回其对英法建议的复文，威胁捷克政府说：“如果英国忠告遭受拒绝，那么捷克政府可以自由采取其认为于局势发展有利的任何步骤。”
    一九三八年九月二十九日至三十日，希特勒、张伯伦、莫索里尼和达拉第，在慕尼黑会议上最后缔结了罪恶的密约。捷克代表们只被邀赴慕尼黑俯首帖耳地等待帝国主义者们阴谋的后果。英法的阴谋行为，决非政策上的临时转变，而是他们政策的极重要的一方面。这个政策的目的，即在煽动希特勒侵略者反苏。
    苏联曾经公开宣称，愿意履行苏法捷互助条约的义务，支持捷克反对德国。然而法国拒绝履行其义务。把捷克交给德国之后，英法政府争先与希特勒德国签订广泛的政治协定。英德宣言是一九三八年九月三十日，由张伯伦与希特勒在慕尼黑签订的。该宣言称：“英德关系对于我们两国与欧洲都极为重要。我们认为昨晚签字的协定与英德海军协定，象征着我两民族决不愿彼此作战。”庞莱、李宾特洛甫的法德宣言，于一九三八年十二月签署。该宣言称：“德法和平与睦邻关系，对于巩固欧洲的关系和维持普遍和平，至为必要。因此，两国政府将竭尽全力，保证维持彼此间的这种关系。”这是英德、法德的互不侵犯宣言。
    这些协定，实质上意味着英法和希特勒签订了不侵犯条约。这些协定显示：英法政府为了摆脱希特勒侵略它们本国的威胁，以为慕尼黑协定及其他类似协定，是给希特勒匪徒打开大门，使其向东向苏联侵略。“统一欧洲”（苏联不在内）的政治条件，就是这样建立起来的。他们所追逐的，就是完全孤立苏联。
