　　[This Newspaper's Report] In order to effectively protect and cultivate forests in this region and promote afforestation and tree planting campaigns, the Border Region Government has specially formulated the "Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Forest Protection and Cultivation Measures," which were officially promulgated and implemented on March 10, 1937. The full text is as follows:

　　I. These measures are specifically formulated to protect and cultivate both publicly and privately owned forests and trees within this Border Region.

　　II. In accordance with Article 9 of the Land Law Outline, the handling of forest ownership is specifically stipulated as follows: (A) Large forests shall be managed by the Border Region Government or entrusted to the administrative office for management. (B) Original county-owned forests within a county, or mountain forests jointly owned by several villages, may, with the consent of the county peasant representative assembly, be designated as county-owned forests and managed by the county government. (C) Original forbidden mountains and forbidden forests within a village may, with the consent of the village peasant representative assembly, be confirmed as village-owned forests and managed by the village government. (D) Forests originally belonging to landlords or village, clan, temple, or lineage properties shall, if requested by the masses for distribution, be distributed to the masses for joint management.

　　III. After the ownership of mountain forests and trees is determined, public forests must have their forest area, boundaries, forest conditions, and management methods reported to the higher-level government for the record. Private forests owned by the masses must go through land title determination procedures and apply to the government for a title deed.

　　IV. After the ownership of public and private forests is determined, a certain management organization must be established to formulate management methods and earnestly take responsibility for protection and cultivation, sowing on time and felling on time. The government should also reward and support the development of mountain forests distributed to the masses.

　　V. Public forest land, forbidden mountains, village forests, and private forests distributed to the masses for joint ownership are only allowed for afforestation and not for reclamation. If reclamation is necessary, public forests must be approved by the Border Region Government or the administrative office, while village forests and private forests jointly owned by the masses must be approved by the county government.

　　VI. For barren mountains, river滩, embankments, and roadsides where ownership has not been determined, if the masses voluntarily carry out afforestation and tree planting, they shall be registered and approved by the county government or the competent authority and belong to the masses. If afforestation and tree planting are carried out jointly by mutual aid groups, they shall belong to the masses of the mutual aid group.

　　VII. Trees planted by government agencies and organizations, if located on private land, belong to the landowner; if located on public land without declaration and registration with the local government, they shall belong to the village collectively. If the public land has been distributed to the masses, the planted trees shall also be transferred with the land rights.

　　VIII. Regardless of whether they are public or private forests, no agency, military unit, or organization may fell trees without the consent of the management agency and the forest owner. If felling is necessary, the management agency must formulate felling methods. Private forests must be felled with the consent of the forest owner and at a fair price, but new forests must be cultivated immediately after felling.

　　IX. Those who cultivate nurseries on village public land or private land shall be exempt from land tax.

　　X. In protecting and cultivating mountain forests, it is also necessary to determine methods for the masses to collect mountain products as a sideline, so that the cultivation of mountain forests and the collection of mountain products as a sideline are not delayed.

　　XI. Anyone who fails to comply with government laws and regulations and the covenants of forbidden mountains and forbidden forests, and who fells or steals timber without authorization, or whose livestock and sheep damage trees, shall be dealt with according to law and ordered to compensate for losses. Those who intentionally sabotage shall be subject to heavier penalties.

　　XII. Government agencies and cadres who have made contributions to the protection and cultivation of forests shall be rewarded by the government at any time.

　　XIII. Agencies at all levels managing mountain forests, as well as village forbidden mountains and village public forests, may formulate their own management methods and forbidden forest and forbidden mountain covenants without conflicting with the principles of these measures.

　　XIV. These measures shall be promulgated and implemented by order of the Border Region Government.

    一、为保护与培植本边区内公有、私有之林木，特制定本办法。
    二、依据土地法大纲第九条之规定，对林木所有权之处理，特规定如下：（甲）大山林由边区政府管理，或委托行署管理之。（乙）一县范围内原有之县公林，或数村共有之山林，经县农代会之同意，得作为县公林，由县政府管理之。（丙）一村范围内原有之禁山、禁林，经村农代会之同意，仍确定为村公林，由村政府管理之。（丁）原属地主或村、社、庙、族产之森林，群众要求分配者，得分给群众，由分得之群众共同管理之。
    三、山林树木经确定所有权后，属于公林者，须将森林面积、四界、林木情况及管理办法呈报上级政府备案。属于群众私有者，须依据地权确定手续，向政府呈领契证。
    四、公林私林所有权确定后，须建立一定之管理组织，拟具管理办法，切实负责保护与培植。按时播种，按时采伐。对群众分得之山林，政府亦应奖励与扶植其发展。
    五、公有林地、禁山、村林及分给群众伙有之私林，只准造林，不准开荒。必须开荒时，公林须经边府或行署批准，村林及群众伙有之私林，须经县政府批准。
    六、未确定所有权之荒山河滩，堤岸道旁，群众自愿造林植树者，由县政府或主管机关登记批准，归群众所有。由互助组共同造林植树者，归互助组群众所有。
    七、机关团体所植之树木，如在私有地内者，属于土地所有人，如在公地未经声明并在当地政府备案者，均归所在村公有。公地已分给群众者，所植之林木亦随地权转移。
    八、无论公私林木，未经管理机关及林主之同意，任何机关部队团体，均不得采伐。必须采伐时，得由管理机关拟定采伐办法。私有林木，必须商得林主同意，并须公平给价，但须于采伐后，即时培植新林。
    九、在村公地或私有地内培育苗圃者，其占用土地免除负担。
    十、保护与培植山林，并须确定群众采集山货副业办法，使培植山林与采集山货副业两不耽误。
    十一、凡不遵守政府法令及禁山、禁林公约，擅自砍伐，窃取林木或牲畜羊群损坏，均应依法处办，并令赔偿损失。其故意破坏者加重处罚。
    十二、保护与培植林木有功之机关干部，政府应随时给以奖励。
    十三、各级管理山林之机关及村禁山、村公林等，在不抵触本办法之原则下，得自订管理办法及禁林、禁山公约。
