　　[Our Dispatch] According to a letter from Comrade Li Yucai of Lincheng, after the May 4th Directive, the majority of the Fourth District and the western part of the Third District of the county wrongly expanded the scope of class classification and struggle, and randomly struggled against middle and poor peasants. Factionalism among cadres was rampant, and bad cadres in large villages colluded with bad district cadres to suppress small villages, causing panic among the masses, extravagance, and negative production, which was quite serious. Most of the villages in this area have poor land on hillsides, making it a relatively poor area, but during the mass movement, the number of households struggled against in most villages was more than 30 percent, and the population accounted for 35 percent, with a minimum of 20 percent. For example, in Zhaojia Chongli Village, out of 26 households, 19 were struggled against. Because the landlords and rich peasants in this village had mostly fled or gone bankrupt during the War of Resistance Against Japan, merely struggling against landlords and rich peasants could not thoroughly overturn things. Therefore, 13 or 14 well-to-do middle peasant households were also struggled against. At the same time, the four village cadres headed by the chairman of the Peasants' Association and the chairman of the Military Committee (both poor peasants) had conflicts with the political director, Ren Erdan. As a result, the chairman of the Peasants' Association and four or five other cadres were beaten and struggled against. Thus, a total of 19 households were struggled against before and after. After returning six middle and poor peasant households when rectifying, there were still 13 households—half of the village—subject to struggle. As a result of the movement, apart from a few village cadres and five or six households who had been overturned too much for other reasons, honest poor peasants and those who had been struggled against could not make a living this spring.

　　In Baigou Village, Third District, the landlords were not thoroughly struggled against, but the middle peasants suffered a lot of damage. This village has 30 households, 125 people, and 1,150 mu of land, averaging 9 mu of barren land per person. There are five households of landlords and rich peasants, occupying 330 mu of better land, with trees and reed marshes accounting for about half. Among them, two households were thoroughly struggled against, and two others, being military dependents with five people, still cultivated 70 mu of better land, and their buildings were untouched. However, six middle and poor peasant households were struggled against. For example, Wei Heichou was originally a poor peasant. When liberated, he inherited more than ten mu of land from his cousin and became a lower-middle peasant. Because he had served as the village head for three months in 1942 and wasted public funds (eating and drinking), he was struggled against. Wu Changyou, a lower-middle peasant with six family members and 30 mu of land, was forced by life to serve as a puppet soldier for a few days and was also struggled against. His brother, Wu Qiuchang (also a lower-middle peasant), had served as a puppet soldier and later joined the army. He was said to have been close to a household being struggled against, and his mother was severely beaten and counted as a household being struggled against. Now the family's life is very difficult. The extravagance and waste were widespread among all classes, and production was sluggish. In the past, the middle peasants in the village were very active in carrying loads and engaging in sideline businesses during slack seasons, earning a large income, but now it is not as good as before. At the same time, the masses in the village were also oppressed by cadres from other villages. Da Hei, a middle peasant in this village, had started from poverty and worked hard, but was burdened by debt. After the incident, he worked hard to produce and collect soil, and restored himself to a middle peasant. Because he was the nephew of Nan Jiahui Village and had bought eight mu of land in Nan Jiahui Village, he had given Jing Jincheng of that village seven yuan, with two yuan in interest. After liberation, Jing Jincheng voluntarily gave Jicha ten yuan. Now Jing Jincheng is the village head of Nan Jiahui Village, manipulating the entire village. Using this excuse, he wanted to take Da Hei to Baigou Village for struggle. Sui Lun, the director of the District Armed Forces Committee, had registered his household in Nan Jiahui. The village cadres wooed him and occupied a lot of fruits, and they were in cahoots with the village cadres of Nan Jiahui. Sui Lun made the decision. Although the masses in Baigou Village were unwilling, they did not dare to reason. Although Da Hei was temporarily detained in Baigou Village, the cadres of Nan Jiahui led dozens of people to Baigou Village, beat Da Hei severely, and demanded cash. As a result, Da Hei died in less than an hour. In another small village, Laoquangou, out of 14 households in the village, 4 were poor and hired peasants, and 10 were middle peasants. After liberation, the district cadres never came to the village to lead the work and did not understand the specific situation. Ji Qiucheng, a middle peasant, was struggled against by Xiquan Village because he had stolen a wooden plank from the landlord of Xiquan Village. His movable property was taken away, and the land was distributed to four poor and hired peasants. Most people in Laoquangou did not advocate struggle and wanted to use adjustment methods to fill up the four poor and hired peasants, but they could not make the decision. The cadres of Nan Jiahui Village wanted to show off and make a fortune by relying on the decision of Sui Lun, the district cadre. They also went to Laoquangou to struggle, tied up Ji Xushan, a middle peasant, and Ji Jiani, a well-to-do middle peasant, and beat them severely, and took back nine shi of grain and movable property. They also struggled against Ji Yushan, a small peddler who carried miscellaneous goods. The district also scolded Laoquangou as a backward village. In Nan Jiahui Village itself, the cadres ruled the masses, and the masses did not dare to speak. More than 20 households were struggled against out of more than 80 households in the village, and seven people were beaten to death, mostly honest middle peasants who had been working for many years, such as Fan Sanjuan and Fan Changsheng." The village cadres and militia activists in this village had been overturned too much, the honest masses still lived hard, and the households who were struggled against were begging for food. The district had always praised it as a model village.

　　In Zhong Jiahui Village, 14 households were struggled against out of 40 households. Tian Laohei's father, Tian Shulin, was originally a landlord and served as a puppet village head after the incident. He was called a model village head by the Japanese invaders. Because of his hooliganism and corruption, he was reduced to a middle peasant. After Tian Laohei became the village head, he became even more corrupt and oppressed the masses. The poor peasant Wang Shuxiao and his father had personal grievances with him. At the beginning of the movement, Tian Laohei put the label of a special agent on him and struggled against him. He was sent to the judicial section, but no facts were found during the investigation, and he was released. He worked as a carpenter in the county's repair shop. Tian Laohei could not vent his anger, so he repeatedly insisted on taking Shuxiao back and beating him to death. His wife and children were also scattered due to poverty. Tian Laohei also had conflicts with village cadres such as Tian Linzi and Tian Xiaoshun (both middle peasant components). Tian Linzi was overthrown and committed suicide by jumping into a well with his wife. His son, Tian Xiaoshun, was severely beaten and imprisoned. The militiaman Tian Jiechou, who was guarding him at night, went out to urinate and was shot to death by another person. The village cadres also blamed Tian Xiaoshun for the crime and beat him to death. Including Tian Jiechou, seven people were beaten to death in this village. In Liang Kou Village, about 40 households were struggled against out of 120 households. The village head Shi Yu (middle peasant) promoted his two maternal cousins, Song Manchang, who had served as a puppet policeman for a few years, to be a public security officer, and Song Bingxi, a landlord who had been transformed into a well-to-do middle peasant, to be the director of the Military Committee. They formed a small clique, wooed district cadres Sui Lun and Dong Guixi to eat, drink, and waste, and gave them more than ten mu of land to be cultivated by the masses on their behalf. They sold the fruit trees and used the money to eat, drink, and buy bicycles, and split the wooden beams and rafters for firewood. The village head Shi Yu committed adultery with a woman and had a child. He also retaliated by shifting the blame to the honest poor peasant Shi Fuxiao, forcing him to confess. From then on, Shi Fuxiao was not given any fruits. Finally, Comrade Li Yucai also said that there were probably more work errors in Lincheng than those revealed in the newspapers from various places. He hoped that the leaders would use policies and regulations as a mirror to carefully examine and quickly correct them.

　　临城三、四区过去划成份有错误
  　错斗中贫农急应检查         
    李玉才同志揭发坏干部挟嫌报复
    【本报消息】据临城李玉才同志来信反映，该县四区大部及三区西部在五四指示后，错划成份扩大斗争面，乱斗中农贫农。干部间闹宗派，大村坏干部勾结坏区干，压小村，闹得群众恐慌不安，铺张浪费，生产消极，情况颇为严重。这一带村庄岗坡坏地多，是较穷的地方，但在大运动中，大部村庄被斗的户数都在百分之三十以上，人口则占百分之三十五，最少也在百分之二十以上。如赵家崇礼村二十六户人家，被斗的就有十九户。因为这个村子的地富，在抗战中多已逃亡破产，光斗地富翻不透身，于是连富裕中农一起斗了十三、四户。同时以农会主任与武委会主任（都是贫农）为首的四个村干部与政治主任任二旦闹矛盾，结果把农会主任等四、五个干部吊打斗争，于是前后被斗的共有十九户，除了填补时退还了六户中贫农外，还有占全村半数——十三户——斗争户。运动结果，除了少数村干及其他原因翻身过高的五、六户外，老实贫农及被斗户今春都没法生活。
    三区柏沟村地主没斗透，中农却损害很多。这村有三十户人家，一百二十五口人，一千一百五十亩地，每人平均分瘠地九亩，地主富农共五户，占较好地三百三十亩，树木苇地约占一半，其中两户斗彻底了，又两户因是军属，五口人，还种较好地七十亩，住的楼房也未动。但另外却斗了六户中贫农，如魏黑丑原是贫农，解放时承受了他族兄十多亩地，成了下中农，因他在一九四二年当过三个月村长，浪费过公款（吃喝），便把他斗争了。下中农吴长有人六口，地三十亩，为生活所逼，当过几天伪军，也被斗争。他哥哥吴秋长（也是下中农）当过伪军，后来又参了军，也说他接近过被斗户，把他母亲百般痛打，也算成被斗户，现在家中生活非常困难。闹得各阶层普遍铺张浪费，生产消极。从前村中农闲时挑担搞副业很积极，收入很大，现在反不如以前，同时该村群众还受外村干部压迫，本村一户中农大黑自小贫苦，劳动起家后又被债务累倒。事变后他努力生产拾坎，又恢复了中农。他因是南驾回村的外甥，曾在南驾回村买了八亩地，给该村井金城拿过七块钱，用了利息二元，解放后井金城又自动给了冀钞十元。现在井金城是南驾回村长，操纵全村，就以这点借口到柏沟村要把大黑带去斗争，区武委会主任睢论，在南驾回下了户，村干部拉拢他，多占了不少果实，和这村干部们一鼻孔出气，就给他们作主。柏沟村群众虽不愿，但不敢讲理，当时虽暂时扣在柏沟村，南驾回干部带领群众数十人到柏沟村，痛打大黑追现洋，结果不到一个钟头大黑就死了。另一个小村老泉沟，全村十四户人家中四户贫雇，十户中农，解放后区干部从未到过该村领导工作，不了解具体情况。中农吉秋成因偷过挟泉村地主的木板，挟泉村把他斗了，浮财拿走，土地分给四户贫雇，老泉沟多数人并不主张斗争，想用调剂方法填起四户贫雇，却作不了主。南驾回村干们逞能出风头，想发财仗着区干部睢论作主，也到老泉沟斗争，把中农吉×山、富裕中农吉假妮绑回百般挎打，还拿回九石粮食和浮财，还斗了挑杂货担的小商贩吉玉山。区上还骂老泉沟是落后村。而南驾回本村，则是干部统治群众，群众不敢说话，全村八十多户，斗了二十多户，打死七个人，多系长年劳动的老实中农，如樊三卷、樊长生。”这村干部民兵积极分子翻身都过高，老实群众生活仍苦，被斗户都是讨饭吃，区上一直表扬为模范村。
    中驾回村四十户人家，被斗了十四户。村长田老黑的父亲田书林原是地主，事变后当伪村长，被日寇称为模范村长，因为流氓腐化下降为中家，田老黑当村长后更为腐化，欺压群众，贫农汪书小和他父亲有私人成见，运动一开始，田老黑就给他带上特务帽子斗争他，送到司法科，调查不出事实放了出来，到本县修械所当木工，田老黑出不了气，便三番五次的硬把书小要回打死，家里妻子也都因生活穷苦而失散。田老黑还和田林子、田小顺等村干（都是中农成份）闹矛盾。田林子被斗垮了，和他老婆一齐跳井自杀，又把他儿子田小顺毒打后禁闭起来。夜里看守的民兵田结丑出去小便，被另一个开枪打死，村干也把罪归田小顺而把他打死。这个村子连田结丑在内，也打死了七个人。两口村一百二十户斗了四十户上下，村长史玉（中农）提拔他的两个姨兄弟当过几年伪警的宋满常当公安员，地主化为富裕中农的宋兵喜为武委会主任，结成小集团，拉拢区干部睢论、董贵喜等吃喝浪费，还给了他们十多亩地让群众代耕。把果实树卖了吃喝买自行车，干木梁材椽劈了当柴烧。村长史玉和一个妇女通奸，有了孩子，还挟嫌报复，移祸于老实贫农史福小，屈打成招，从此不分给史福小果实。最后李玉才同志还说，象报上揭发的各地工作错误在临城恐怕更多，希望领导上，拿政策法令做为镜子，仔细检查迅速纠正。
