       Licheng Beiliu Village: After Reading the Border Region Government's Proclamation, Everyone is Enthusiastic About Production
    [Licheng News] After receiving the 11th issue of the People's Daily, the Beiliu Village in the Second District saw the Border Region Government's proclamation to the entire region about the news that whoever cultivates the land will harvest it. On the night of the 12th, they convened a meeting of more than a hundred poor peasants. First, they read the newspaper to everyone, and then gave a detailed explanation to reassure everyone. Then, they broke into groups for discussion. Liu Shuangqin (middle peasant) said: "Spring is early this year, so we must hurry up and intensify spring plowing and accumulate fertilizer." Li Sheng (poor peasant) said: "These past two days it has been raining. If we can't go to the fields to produce, let's push the millstone for a day or two to prepare food for spring plowing. The grass in the wheat fields has turned green because of the rain. When the weather clears up, we must quickly organize people to hoe the wheat once." Finally, everyone unanimously said: We must complete this plan. We must ensure that both livestock and people are busy, and we must also urge the landlords to produce and not let them just stay at home eating without moving. (Jinxi, Naiwang)

       黎城北流村　念了边府布告　人人生产带劲
    【黎城消息】二区北流村，于接到十一号人民日报后，看到边区政府布告全区，安心生产谁种谁收的消息，十二号夜召集中贫农百余人开会，首先将这报向大家念过，最后又作详细的解释，使大家更安心。接着分组讨论，刘双芹说（中农）：“今年春浅，要赶快加紧春耕，还要积肥。”里生说（贫农）：“这两天下雨，要不能到地生产的话，先推一两天碾磨，准备春耕吃，下雨了麦地的草都发绿了，天晴了赶快组织人把麦锄一次。”最后大家一致说：咱一定要完成这个计划，一定做到牲口人两不闲，还要督促地主生产，不能叫他们还是在家光吃不动弹。（进喜、乃旺）
