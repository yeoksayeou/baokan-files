　　Famous Play "Red Leaf River" Published
　　This is a new play about how poor and hired peasants were oppressed by feudal landlords in the past, and how, after the Eighth Route Army came, they were mistreated by a few ungrateful cadres, who scolded them as being "dead backward," so they never turned themselves around. The ending depicts how the poor and hired peasants were finally mobilized and stood up. This play is very consistent with our current actual situation. Everyone will definitely find it very helpful for their work after reading it. It has now been published in limited quantities, so please buy it quickly! In particular, all theater troupes should purchase it as soon as possible.

　　名剧“赤叶河”出版了
    这是个新剧本，写的是贫雇群众过去怎样受封建地主的压迫，八路军来后，又受少数忘本干部的苛待，骂他们是“死落后”，所以一直没翻身；最后写的是如何发动贫雇翻了身。这个剧本与咱们目前实际情况很一致，大家看了对工作定有很大帮助。现已出版，数目不多，请大家赶快买吧！特别各个剧团应尽快购买。
