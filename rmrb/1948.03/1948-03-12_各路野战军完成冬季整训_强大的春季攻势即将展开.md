　　Various Field Armies Complete Winter Training; Powerful Spring Offensive About to Unfold
　　After the great victory southwest of Yichuan in one day, the Northwest People's Liberation Army, victoriously advancing towards the Chiang-controlled areas, captured Yichuan County on the 3rd, completely annihilating the headquarters of the 24th Brigade, two complete regiments, and the Yichuan Security Police Brigade of the enemy's 76th Division. In total, this entire Yichuan annihilation battle eliminated a total of 28,500 enemy troops from Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of elite forces, including one army headquarters, two division headquarters, and five complete brigades. One enemy army commander, three division commanders and deputy division commanders, three brigade commanders, four army, division, and brigade chiefs of staff, five regimental commanders, and one puppet county magistrate were captured. Congratulations have been pouring in from various liberated areas in recent days. Our army is now continuing to expand its powerful and victorious offensive, advancing deep into the southern part of the Huanglong sub-district. On the 6th, the important town of Shifu was recovered, and on the 8th, the security team of the puppet Chengcheng County was annihilated in Fengyuan Town, south of Shifu, capturing over a hundred prisoners. A spokesperson for the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army commented that this victory has changed the situation in the Northwest. The bandit Hu's directly commanded forces now only have 23 brigades left. Except for the 78th Brigade of the 1st Division and the 28th Brigade of the 36th Division, which were not completely destroyed, Hu Zongnan's army has no backbone left. As for the Chiang bandits' regular army in the Northwest, including the troops that were replenished after being annihilated once or twice in the past, there are currently only 34 brigades of direct and miscellaneous troops. Not only is the enemy's army extremely empty in Guanzhong, especially in Gansu, unable to stop the offensive of the People's Liberation Army; this situation will inevitably affect the deployment of the Chiang bandits on the southern front, which will facilitate more effective cooperation with the Chen Xie, Chen Su, and Liu Deng field armies on the southern front in the future. The spokesperson particularly pointed out that the most important reason for this victory is that the Northwest People's Liberation Army carried out a new type of military rectification movement of "speaking bitterness" and "three checks," greatly improving the troops' awareness of fighting to eliminate the public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and rapidly improving combat effectiveness, which will make them invincible in the world. The spokesperson also expressed with unlimited confidence that the Jin-Cha-Ji, Shandong, Subei, and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu field armies have all completed the winter "three checks" rectification movement. In addition, our army in the Northeast has won consecutive victories and is making persistent efforts. A powerful spring offensive will soon begin.
　　In the February winter offensive, our Northeast Army, traversing the vast expanse of the Northeast, eliminated more than 46,000 enemy troops, captured more than 107 enemy officers above the rank of colonel, and captured five important cities. It is now expanding its victory.
　　On the southern front: The people's armed forces in the new liberated areas are growing stronger and continue to clear out local Chiang bandits. In February, the local armed forces of the Yu-Shaan-E border region wiped out 7,022 bandits in the Funiu Mountains, seizing nearly 20,000 guns. The local Chiang bandits in the Jia (County)-Lin (Ru) area have been completely eliminated. As a result of our implementation of a lenient policy, several bandit leaders in Song County, Fangcheng, Wuyang, and other areas have surrendered to us and handed over their weapons. The Yu-Wan-Su people's armed forces, in the week from the 15th to the 21st of last month, completely defeated more than 8,000 local Chiang bandits gathered in the Luyi, Zhecheng, Taikang, and Guoyang areas, eliminating more than 2,700 of them, and recovering the two county towns of Luyi and Zhecheng. After this annihilation, the local Chiang bandits of this unit have all retreated to Shangqiu and other strongholds, and dare not leave easily. A unit of the local armed forces of the Jianghan Military Region, active on the north bank of the Yangtze River, captured Changping Town, 40 miles north of Yuan'an, on the 21st of last month, annihilating the entire bandit township office and a unit of the Yuan'an Self-Defense Regiment that came to its aid, capturing more than 80 bandits including the township chief and team leader. On the 29th, they ambushed Wamiaoji, northwest of Tianmen on the Hanyi Highway, destroying eight enemy vehicles, capturing one Chiang bandit Hubei Provincial Inspector Commissioner, and more than 80 men below the company commander and adjutant of the 85th Division. A unit of the Tongbai Military Region raided Wenquji, eight miles northwest of Deng County, on the 13th of last month, annihilating the entire 500-strong 9th Security Regiment of Chiang bandits in Neixiang. The local armed forces of the Su-Wan Second Military Sub-district, together with a unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army, launched an offensive on the Gaoyou-Baoying-Huaian line on the Grand Canal on the 22nd of last month, capturing and forcing the retreat of six Chiang bandit strongholds such as Sishui on the line. The local armed forces of the Lunan First Military Sub-district captured Laozhaishan and Luofosi, the outer strongholds of Sishui City, and eliminated more than 50 local Chiang bandits.

　　各路野战军完成冬季整训　强大的春季攻势即将展开
    向蒋管区胜利挺进的西北解放军，继一日宜川西南大捷后，又在三日，攻克宜川县城，全歼守敌整七十六师的廿四旅旅部，两个整团，及伪宜川保警大队。总计此次整个宜川大歼灭战，共消灭蒋胡匪嫡系精锐部队一个军部，二个师部，五个整旅，共两万八千五百余人。歼俘敌军长一名、正副师长三名、旅长三名、军、师、旅参谋长四名、团长五名、及伪县长一名。日来各解放区贺电纷驰。现我大军正继续扩展强大胜利攻势，向黄龙分区南部长驱挺进，六日收复石辅重镇，八日又在石辅南的冯原镇将伪澄城县保安队歼灭，生俘百十余名。解放军总部发言人评论：此次胜利已改变西北形势。胡匪直接指挥的兵力，现在只剩下廿三个旅。除整一师的七十八旅及整三十六师之二十八旅未残灭以外，胡宗南军队已没有什么骨干。至于蒋匪在西北的正规军，包括过去被歼一次至两次后又补充起来的部队在内，所有嫡系与杂牌部队，目前总共仅三十四个旅。不仅整编于关中，特别是甘肃方面，敌军异常空虚，无法阻止解放军的攻势；此一形势又势必牵动蒋匪南线部分部署，今后便于更有效的配合南线陈谢、阵粟、刘邓三路野战军作战。发言人特别指出：这次胜利的最主要的一个原因，是西北解放军进行了诉苦及三查的新式整军运动，大大提高了部队的为消灭人民公敌蒋介石匪帮而战的觉悟性，使战斗力迅速提高，将使自己无敌于天下。发言人并以无限信心的提出了晋察翼、山东、苏北与晋翼鲁豫各路野战军，均已完成冬季三查整训运动，加上东北我军连战皆捷，再接再厉，强大的春季攻势作战即将展开。
    纵横白山黑水间的东北我军，二月份冬季攻势作战，共毙敌四万六千余名，歼俘敌校级军官以上军官一百零七名，攻克重要城市五处，现正乘胜扩张战果中。
    南线方面：各新解放区的人民武装日益壮大，并继续清剿土著蒋匪。二月份豫陕鄂各分区地武在伏牛山区，歼匪七千零二十二名，收枪近二万支，郏（县）临（汝）地区土蒋已被彻底肃清。由于我执行宽大政策的结果，嵩县、方城、舞阳等区若干土匪头目均已向我投诚，交出枪支。豫皖苏人民武装在上月十五至二十一日一周内，在鹿邑、柘城、太康、涡阳地区，将集结了八千余之土著蒋匪全部击溃，并歼其二千七百余，收复鹿邑、柘城两座县城。该部土著蒋匪经此次歼灭性打击后，均龟缩于商邱各据点内，再不敢轻离活动。活跃于长江北岸的江汉军区的地方武装一部，在上月二十一日攻克远安北四十里之长坪镇，歼匪乡公所全部及来援之远安自卫团一部，俘匪乡长、队长以下八十多名。廿九日又在汉宜公路天门西北之瓦庙集设伏，毁敌汽车八辆，俘蒋匪湖北省督察专员一名，及八十五师连长、副官以下八十余名。桐柏军区部队一部，在上月十三日奔袭邓县城西北八里之文曲集，歼蒋匪内乡保安第九团全部五百余名。苏皖二分区地方武装会同一部华中解放军在上月二十二日向运河线上之高（邮）宝（应）淮（安）间发动攻势，打下及逼退该线蒋匪汜水等六据点。鲁南一分区地方武装攻克泗水城外围据点老寨山、鲁佛寺，歼灭土蒋五十余。　　　　　　　（新华社）
