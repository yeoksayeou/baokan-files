　　Sixth Special District Office Directs All Counties and Districts:
　　Cannot Prohibit the People's Freedom of Trade
　　[This Newspaper's News] The Sixth Special District Office recently instructed all counties and districts to correctly implement the Outline Land Law and not to prohibit the people's freedom of trade or the free withdrawal of shares from cooperatives. The instruction pointed out that the rectification, party consolidation, and democratic work in various counties have begun. Recently, it was discovered that some places do not have a sufficient understanding of the Land Law, especially the regulations on punishing violations of the Land Law issued by the Border Region Government, which has led to misunderstandings. The masses are afraid of violating the Outline Land Law and do not even dare to buy agricultural tools. Some places do not even dare to sell pigs, and they do not dare to sell grain to pay their burden. They do not dare to exchange grain for oil and salt for household use, and they are not allowed to withdraw the shares that the masses have contributed to the cooperatives, causing great difficulties for the masses. This phenomenon is especially serious in areas where rectification has not yet taken place. For this reason, the following three points are specifically instructed: 1. Correctly interpret the Outline Land Law, allowing the people freedom of trade. The Border Region Government's regulations are to prohibit landlords and rich peasants from dispersing their property and some cadres from embezzling and selling the fruits of the struggle by taking advantage of their positions, not to prohibit the people's freedom of trade. All people's trades, etc., shall be allowed freely and shall not be restricted. 2. County, district, and village cooperatives must allow the free withdrawal of shares contributed by the people in accordance with the original regulations, or the transfer to other productions, without any restrictions. 3. Spring plowing has already begun. In places where rectification, party consolidation, and democracy have not yet taken place, it is necessary to organize the masses well to purchase agricultural tools and carry out production.

　　六专署指示各县区
  　不能禁止群众自由买卖
    【本报消息】六专署顷指示各县区，正确执行土地法大纲，不能禁止群众的自由买卖，及合作社股金的自由抽入。指示指出各县的填补、整党、民主工作，都已开始进行，近发现有些地方对土地法了解不够，尤其是对边府颁发的破坏土地法治罪条例有误解，群众怕违犯土地法大纲，连购买农具也不敢，有些地方连猪都不敢卖，出负担也不敢卖点粮食，家里用点油盐也不敢拿粮去换，合作社群众入的股金，也不让抽入，造成群众中很大困难。这种现象在未进行填补的地区尤其严重，为此特指示下列三点：一、正确解释土地法大纲，允许群众自由买卖，边府条例是为了禁止地主富农分散财产，及一部分干部贪污多占而偷卖斗争果实，并非禁止群众的自由买卖，凡是群众买卖等，一律允许其自由，不得限制。二、县区村合作社，凡群众入的股金，一定按原规定允许自由抽入，或转入其他生产，不能丝毫限制。三、春耕已经开始，未进行填补整党民主的地方，要很好组织群众购买农具，进行生产。
