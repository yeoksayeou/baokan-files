Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just issued Operation Bulletin No. 30, announcing the great victories of our army's three-month winter offensive (from December 15th of last year to March 15th of this year) as follows:

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: A reporter from this agency commented on the great victories of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's three-month winter offensive, stating: During the three months of the winter offensive, our army annihilated one enemy army headquarters, eight complete divisions, and other scattered units totaling approximately 150,000 men, and won over one division to revolt, averaging more than one enemy division eliminated every ten days. The total number of enemy troops eliminated in three months exceeded half of the total number eliminated last year, which was more than 280,000. At the same time, our army also recovered eighteen important cities, expanded the Northeast Liberated Area by more than 109,000 square kilometers, and liberated more than 6.1 million people.

After this great offensive, the situation in the Northeast today has undergone a fundamental change. The area occupied by Chiang's bandits has shrunk to less than one percent of the Northeast's area. Furthermore, because our army cut the northern section of the Beining Railway into pieces and recovered Yingkou, the supply port for American aid to Chiang, and completely controlled the southern section of the Changchun Railway and the Yingkou branch line south of Shenyang to Liaodong Bay, Chiang's bandit central nest in Shenyang has become increasingly exposed. The few scattered and isolated enemy points and lines are trapped in a dilemma. The enemy's forced retreat from Yongji this time has left only the isolated city of Changchun in what Chiang's bandits call the "Jilin-Changchun Corridor" for advancing into northern Manchuria. In particular, the capture of the strategic stronghold of Siping Street by our army has cut off the enemy's escape route south from Changchun, greatly connecting our East, West, South, and North Manchuria. The acquisition of this advantageous strategic position has laid a solid foundation for our army to completely annihilate Chiang's bandit troops in the Northeast and liberate the entire Northeast in the future.

This offensive by our army was carried out in extreme cold of minus 30 degrees, with continuous large-scale operations; it was an operation under highly centralized force and direct unified command. In a season of knee-deep snow, our army overcame all difficulties, endured hunger and cold, marched thousands of miles, and continued fighting for three months, demonstrating the perseverance, courage, and noble character of our soldiers and the civilian laborers serving with the army, who are loyal to the people. In this offensive, our army mainly fought siege battles, and famous cities and strategic strongholds such as "Iron Liaoyang, Steel Anshan" and Siping Street were all captured by our army. From Zhangwu to Siping, our army only needed three to four minutes to more than ten minutes to break through the enemy's forward positions in combat, and the time to resolve the battle was as short as four hours to only two days, destroying or capturing the enemy's permanent fortifications, demonstrating the great improvement in our army's ability to attack fortified positions. As for field battles, blocking actions, and pursuit battles, our army gave full play to the spirit of mobility and flexibility, fierce attacks, fierce charges, and fierce pursuits, quickly seizing the enemy, overwhelming the enemy, and annihilating the enemy. Compared with previous offensives, our army demonstrated a rapid advance in combat effectiveness. The strategic and tactical thinking and equipment also explain the reasons for the improvement of our army's combat power. Our commanders and fighters have mastered Chairman Mao's and General Lin Biao's strategic guidance and tactical thinking. In the latter case, our army, based on the specific enemy situation in this area, developed from the "three-three system" and "one point, two sides" tactics to the "four fast, one slow" tactics of encirclement and breakthrough, expansion of results, rapid pursuit, and good control of the timing of general attacks. The mastery of this complete set of combat tactics and techniques has made our army invincible and able to overcome all obstacles. Secondly, because of the large number of American weapons we seized from Chiang's bandits in more than a year of combat, many divisions and regiments have become American-equipped units, and firepower has been greatly strengthened. In terms of the replenishment of manpower and material resources and the soaring morale, since the land reform in the Northeast Liberated Area, our army has obtained an incomparably powerful source of manpower and material resources. A large number of liberated peasants have joined the army and have generally undergone education in venting grievances, seeking revenge, and land reform. The political consciousness of the fighters has rapidly improved, their courage has increased a hundredfold, and they have strictly implemented disciplines and policies such as protecting urban industry and commerce. It is precisely because of the combination of excellent equipment, skilled tactics and techniques, improved political consciousness, and a tenacious fighting style that our army has realized the bold statement of "no enemy that cannot be defeated, no city that cannot be captured" and achieved a series of great victories in winter operations.

On the other hand, the enemy army was always passive, disorganized in deployment, and resisted everywhere during our winter offensive, unable to defend against everything. At the beginning of this year, in the great victory of Gongzhutun, the enemy army once concentrated its maximum force of more than 20 divisions to reinforce Faku, but as a result, we annihilated one army headquarters and two complete divisions, and ten divisions of reinforcing enemies were also blocked by our army only ten or so li away from the annihilated battlefield. This heavy blow made the enemy army dare not reinforce the besieged enemy with a single soldier, and sit idly by while one division after another was annihilated in Xinlitun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Faku, and Siping. At the same time, the enemy army, starting with the abandonment of the Songhua River bridgehead fortress, experienced a series of abandoned city escapes in Xinlitun, Goubangzi, and Faku. This development has reached a considerable height with the recent abandonment of Yongji by the enemy army. However, the fleeing enemy was also partially pursued and annihilated by our army (such as Goubangzi and Yongji), or completely annihilated (such as Xinlitun and Faku). This further shows that the enemy army is already in a predicament of being annihilated whether defending, escaping, or reinforcing. As for Fan Hanjie's mechanized corps, which Chiang's bandits boasted about, it was also timid in battle when our army attacked the Beining Line and Yingkou, hovering around Jinzhou and shrinking back. In short, the enemy army is now weakening in combat power and its strategic policy has gone bankrupt. In this situation, the entire Provisional 58th Division of Chiang's army revolted before Yingkou was besieged, which is indeed pointing out the only bright path for all enemy troops in the Northeast.

    【新华社东北二十七日电】分社记者评述东北人民解放军冬季攻势三个月的伟大战绩称：我军在冬季攻势三个月中，歼敌一个军部，八个整师及其他零星部队约十五万人，并争取其一个师起义，平均每十天消灭敌军一个多师，三个月歼敌总数超过去年全年歼敌总数二十八万余的一半。同时我军并收复重要城市十八座，扩大东北解放区十万九千余平方公里，解放人民六百一十万余。
    经过这一次伟大的攻势，今天东北的局势已经起了根本的改变。蒋匪占领区缩小至只占东北面积不到百分之一，又由于我军将北宁路北段斩为寸断，收复美帝援蒋的供应港营口，完全控制沈阳以南以迄辽东湾的中长路南段及营口支线，就使得蒋匪中心巢穴沈阳日益裸露，少数零散孤立点线之敌陷于进退维谷的境地。这次永吉之敌被逼撤退，使得蒋匪作为进窥北满的所谓“吉长走廊”已经只剩下长春孤城，特别是战略要塞四平街的被我攻克，更截断了长春敌军向南逃窜的道路，使我东、西、南、北满的联系大为贯通。这一优势的战略地位的取得，就给我军今后全部歼灭东北蒋匪，解放全东北奠定了一个坚实的基础。
    我军这次攻势是冒着零下三十度的奇寒，连续大规模的作战；是在高度集中兵力与直接统一指挥下的作战。在雪深及膝的季节里，我军排除一切困难，忍饥耐寒，千里行军，持续作战达三个月之久，这显示出我军战士及随军服务的民工们那种坚毅勇敢与忠于人民的高尚气质。在这次攻势中，我军一般的以攻坚战为主，号称“铁辽阳、钢鞍山”的名城及战略要塞四平街都为我军一一攻克。从彰武到四平，我军在战斗中突破敌人前沿只要三、四分钟到十多分钟，解决战斗的时间少至四小时多仅两天，就将敌永久性工事加以摧毁或夺取，显示我军攻坚能力的大大提高。至于在野战、阻击与追歼战中，我军更发挥了机动灵活，猛打、猛冲、猛追的精神，迅速抓住敌人，压倒敌人，歼灭敌人，较之前此诸次攻势，更表现我军在战斗力方面的猛进。在战略战术思想与装备方面也说明了我军战力提高的原因。我军指战员们都掌握了毛主席和林彪将军的战略指导和战术思想。以后者论，我军根据本区具体敌情，从“三三制”，“一点两面”战术，发展到包围突破，扩张战果，追击快速，总攻击时机很好掌握的“四快一慢”战术。这一整套作战的战术和技术的掌握，使我军战无不胜，攻无不克。再次由于年余作战中我缴获蒋匪的大批美式武器，许多师团都成了美械化的部队，炮火大大加强。在人力物力的补充及士气的旺盛方面，东北解放区自从土地改革后，我军获得无比强大的人力物力的源泉，大批翻身农民涌入部队，并普遍经过诉苦复仇与土改教育，战士们政治觉悟迅速提高，勇气百倍增涨，严格执行了保护城市工商业等纪律和政策。正由于这一种装备优良，战术技术的熟练，政治觉悟的提高与顽强的战斗作风相结合，就使我军实现了“没有打不垮的敌人，没有攻不下的城市”的豪语，而获得冬季作战中一连串的伟大胜利。
    反观敌军在我冬季攻势中始终被动，布署紊乱，处处招架，防不胜防。今年岁首公主屯大捷中，敌军曾一度集中其最大限度兵力二十余个师增援法库，结果被我歼其一冀两个整师和一个军部，援敌十个师亦被我阻击于距歼灭战场仅十余里之处。这一沉重的打击，使敌军再也不敢以一兵一卒增援被围之敌，而坐视其一个师一个师在新立屯、辽阳、鞍山、法库和四平诸地就歼。同时，敌军以放弃松花江桥头堡垒为开端，发生了新立屯、沟帮子、法库等一连串的弃城逃窜，这一发展到最近敌军放弃永吉已经达到相当高度。但是逃窜之敌也都被我追歼一部（如沟帮子和永吉），或全部歼灭（如新立屯和法库）。这更说明了敌军已经处于守也被歼，逃也被歼，增援也被歼的困境中。就蒋匪大吹特吹的范汉杰机械化兵团而论，当我军进攻北宁线及营口时，亦同样怯战，徘徊锦州一带，龟缩不前。总之，敌军现在已经是战力日弱，战略方针破产。在这种情况下乃有营口被围之前蒋军暂五十八师的整师起义，这的确是给东北的一切敌军指出唯一的一条光明生路。
