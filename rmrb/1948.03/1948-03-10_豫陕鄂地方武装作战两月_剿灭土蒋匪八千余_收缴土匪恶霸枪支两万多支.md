Xinhua News Agency, Yushan'e Front, March 8th: A comprehensive report states that in January and February, the local armed forces of the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei districts, in conjunction with parts of the People's Liberation Army, actively suppressed local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants in the Funiu Mountain area, eliminating a total of more than 8,000 bandits and seizing over 20,000 guns from bandits and local tyrants. According to incomplete statistics, in January, the local armed forces of various districts fought thirty-three battles with local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants, killing and capturing 1,525 bandits, including three major battles in which bandit leaders Li Yi'en and Chen De, among others, were killed or captured. In February, more than thirty battles were fought with bandits, and initial statistics show that 7,022 bandits were annihilated. Several areas, such as Jia (County) and Lin (Ru), have been completely cleared of local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants, with the successive killings and captures of Ping Wenzheng, commander of the local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants in Linru, Huang Jinyi, bandit leader Jin Liming in the Baofeng area, bandit leader Zhang Hongshan in the Yiyang area, bandit leaders Wang Guodong and Ding Hailiang in the Yiyang area, and bandit leaders Wang Ji, Han Lubin, Han Zhizhong, Wang Zhongyi, and Wang Laotai in the Jia (County) and Lin (Ru) areas, among more than twenty others. Our army implemented a lenient policy during the suppression, quickly releasing farmers who were forced to join the bandits, allowing them to return home to divide land and participate in production. During the suppression, political appeals were also combined, so that lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the bandits consciously laid down their arms. For example, during the suppression in the Jia (County) and Lin (Ru) area, when attacking Taipu Village, the bandits surrendered completely after hearing the appeals of our soldiers. On February 21st, over a hundred bandits stationed in Jingziguan, a strategic point in Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, also surrendered to us. Some small and medium-sized bandit leaders in Nanzhao, Song County, Fangcheng, and Wuyang areas have voluntarily contacted us to hand over their guns. During the bandit suppression, the masses actively participated, even mobilizing overnight on the eve of the Lunar New Year.
   
Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, March 7th: A unit of the Tongbai Military Region's People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants of the Minggang Town Office at Wangzhuang Village, northwest of the Minggang Station on the Pinghan Railway, on the 4th, killing and wounding more than twenty enemies, capturing the local Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Wang Jingchang and more than ten others alive, and seizing more than thirty long and short guns. Furthermore, a unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated a part of the 4th Squadron of the Zhaoyang Security Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Biangou Town, sixty miles northeast of Fancheng, on the 28th of last month, killing and capturing more than thirty enemy officers and soldiers, and seizing eighteen long and short guns and a part of other military supplies.
