Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Moscow dispatch: In the socialist great competition upsurge of completing the Five-Year Plan in four years, astonishing miracles continue to emerge. Tolonkov, a miner from Gorlovka in the Donets Basin, mined 669 tons of coal in seven hours on February 24th, creating another astonishing new record. After Tolonkov created a historical new record of mining 426 tons of coal in one shift on the 13th of last month, he was surpassed on the 16th by his fellow miner Sharnikov, who mined 513 tons of coal in one shift. However, in less than ten days, Tolonkov broke Sharnikov's record again, with a coal output exceeding the previous record by 156 tons.

Another dispatch: On February 19th, the eve of the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet collective farm system, 188 of Ukraine's most outstanding agricultural workers were awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for their amazing harvests of wheat, rye, corn, and sugar beets. Celebration rallies were held in collective farms throughout Ukraine.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Moscow dispatch: A new movement to increase production profits and eliminate government subsidies is being enthusiastically launched among workers throughout the Soviet Union. After a meeting between the Presidium of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union and representatives of various factories on the 20th of last month, a circular was recently issued to all trade unions to launch and support this movement. According to a report in the "News" newspaper: Not long ago, nine factories in Moscow guaranteed to the government that they would produce even greater profits than before. This movement quickly spread to all provinces, borders, and republics throughout the Soviet Union, and now millions of workers, technicians, engineers, and office staff have been swept up in this great movement.
