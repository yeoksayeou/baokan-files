　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: According to Tianjin newspapers, labor strikes have repeatedly occurred in Tianjin, Gula, and Wuhan due to rapidly rising prices. More than 600 workers at the Machinery Factory of the Jiang bandit Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau and workers managing the ship locks jointly launched a full-scale strike on the 11th, demanding that the Jiang bandit bureau improve workers' lives, issue "priceless rations" of rice and flour each month, and retroactively pay the wage increases for January, February, and March of this year. They only resumed work on the 13th after achieving initial victory. The Jiang bandit's clothing factory massacre of workers in Wuhan, which occurred four months ago, remains unresolved. Earlier this month, over a hundred workers, driven by hunger, seized rice to satisfy their hunger, and were violently suppressed by the Jiang bandit authorities, with as many as 400 workers arrested. On the 8th, a large number of workers' families gathered at the Jiang bandit's Wuhan headquarters to petition and protest, demanding the immediate release of the arrested workers. At the same time, carpenters and masons also went on strike for two days demanding higher wages. On the 8th, more than 300 workers once gathered to petition and protest against the stubborn attitude of the capitalists at several construction factories, and were immediately suppressed by Jiang bandit police firing guns, and 29 workers were arrested by the Jiang bandits. The situation is now escalating.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: According to newspapers in the Jiang area, four students from Lanzhou University, Wang Shuangk, Wei Zhuanshu, Geng Gongshun, and Tian Fenghou, saw Jiang bandit soldiers from the 22nd Regiment of the Military Police beating a farmer while passing through Zhonghua Road on the evening of February 25th. They immediately stepped forward to offer righteous persuasion, but the inhuman Jiang bandit soldiers severely beat them and detained them in their team headquarters for as long as four hours. Among them, Wang Shuangk was seriously injured and vomited blood, endangering his life. This has aroused public outrage among Lanzhou University students, and an Anti-Violence Action Committee was established the next day to condemn the Jiang bandit's atrocities. In other news, Gu Yuyi, a student representative from the Judicial Group of Chaoyang University in Beiping, who was fighting for full public funding, was arrested by the Jiang bandits in Nanjing in late last month.

  　津沽武汉工潮不断
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】据天津报纸消息：在物价猛烈高涨下，津沽武汉工潮迭起。蒋匪塘沽新港工程局机械工厂工人六百余人，及管理船闸工人联合于十一日举行全体罢工，要求蒋匪局方改善工人生活，每月发给“无价配给”食米及面粉，及补发本年一、二、三月工资加成数。直到十三日，获初步胜利后才复工。武汉蒋匪被服总厂枪杀工人惨案拖延四月尚未解决，本月初百余工人因迫于饥饿，抢米充饥，当遭蒋匪当局暴力镇压，被捕工人竟达四百余人。八日，大批工人眷属群集至蒋匪武汉行辕请愿抗议，要求立即释放被捕工人。与此同时，泥木两业工人亦因要求提高工资罢工两天。八日三百余工人一度集队请愿，并至数营造厂抗议资方固执态度，当场竟遭蒋匪警察鸣枪镇压，并有工人二十九人遭蒋匪逮捕，现事态正趋扩大。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据蒋区报纸消息：兰州大学学生王双科、魏钻叔、耿公顺、田丰厚四人，二月二十五日晚行经中华路时，看到蒋匪宪兵二十二团宪兵殴打一农民，当即上前仗义劝解，毫无人性的蒋匪宪兵竟将他们痛殴并押往其队部监禁达四小时之久。其中王双科伤重吐血不止，有生命危险。此举已激起兰大学生公愤，次日即成立抗暴行动委员会，声讨蒋匪暴行。另讯：北平朝阳大学司法组争取全面公费请愿学生代表谷雨仪，上月下旬在南京横遭蒋匪逮捕。
