　　Prohibition of Confiscation of Middle Peasant Shares
  　Shahe Government Specifies Concrete Measures
    [This newspaper's Shahe dispatch] After the promulgation of the Land Law, many village cadres in Shahe arbitrarily organized "Poor Peasant Associations," shouting "The poor and hired peasants are in power; the poor and hired peasant line." A cadre from Ximazhuang in the Fifth District said, "I used to take the middle peasant line, but from now on I will take the poor and hired peasant line!" He then extracted the dividends from the middle peasants' shares in the cooperative and gave them to his "Poor Peasant Association" as production capital. The poor and hired peasant director of Jiangjunmu in the Second District was a former cadre who had been dismissed. After becoming the director, he confiscated all the shares in the cooperative. The Dukou Cooperative in the First District did not even allow women to move their textile shares. These actions caused ideological confusion among the masses of all strata and seriously hampered spring plowing. In Balizhuang, Sixth District, when middle and poor peasants built houses and felled trees for beams, a teacher said, "Cutting down trees is destroying the Land Law." In order to correct this error, the county put forward the following specific measures and issued instructions: (1) All shares and dividends of middle and poor peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) shall be respected for their shareholder status. They are free to withdraw or contribute. The dividends for the past year shall be paid to the shareholders by the cooperative. (2) All middle and poor peasants who have been wrongly struggled against in the past, their shares and dividends still belong to them. Their shareholder status should still be respected, and they are also free to withdraw or contribute. (3) Shares and dividends of landlords and rich peasants, if they are of an industrial and commercial nature, still belong to the individual and shall not be confiscated. Those who are evading the struggle will be temporarily retained in the cooperative and may be handed over to the Peasants' Representative Conference for processing after the conference is established. (4) For cadres who have taken more than their share of the fruits of the struggle, their shares and dividends still belong to them. However, because they have taken more than their share, they may not be withdrawn temporarily. They can only be freely disposed of after the problem of cadres taking more than their share in the rectification and party consolidation is resolved. At present, their shares and dividends can be temporarily retained in the cooperative. (5) All shares and dividends from the fruits of struggle that have been put into the cooperative, as well as various pieces of furniture stored in the cooperative, must be retained by the cooperative. If there is any loss or damage, the cooperative must be responsible for compensation. Those lent to poor and hired peasants for production last winter must also be returned and processed by the Peasants' Representative Conference.

　　禁止没收中农股金
  　沙河政府规定具体办法
    【本报沙河消息】土地法公布后，沙河有不少村干擅自组织了“贫农团”，即喊着“贫雇掌权，贫雇路线”。五区西马庄干部说：“我过去走了中农路线，今后可要走贫雇路线哩”！就把合作社中农入股的红利，抽给他的“贫雇团”作为生产资本。二区将军墓的贫雇主任是过去被撤了职的旧干部，当主任后，就把合作社所有股金一律没收。一区渡口合作社，连妇女纺织的股金都不叫动。这种行动造成各阶层群众思想的混乱，严重妨害春耕。六区八里庄中贫农盖房子，伐树做梁，教员说：“砍伐树木即是破坏土地法”。为了纠正这一错误，县里提出以下几点具体办法，并发出指示：（一）凡中贫农（包括富裕中农）的股金及红利，一律尊重其股东地位，他们愿意抽就抽，愿意入就入，去年一年的红利，应由合作社交付股东。（二）凡是过去斗争错了的中贫农，他们的股金及红利，仍是他们自己的，仍应尊重其股东地位，也同样自由抽自由入。（三）地主富农的股金及红利，凡属于工商业性质的，仍属个人所有，不得没收。凡属逃避斗争者，暂时保留在合作社，待成立农代会后，可交农代会处理。（四）凡是多占果实的干部，他们所入的股金及红利，也仍是他们自己的，但因他有多占果实的问题，可暂时不抽等。填补整党工作中多占果实问题解决后，才可以自由处理，现可暂在合作社保留其股金及红利。（五）凡斗争果实入到合作社的股金及其红利，以及存到合作社里的各种家具，一律要合作社加以保留，如有损失和毁坏，得由合作社负责赔偿。去年冬天借给贫雇去生产的，也得归还由农代会处理。
