[Taihang News] On the 25th of last month, our Fourth Military Sub-district's main force and the Xiuwu-Huojia-Wuzhi Battalion, in the Xiu(wu)-Jiao(zuo)-Bo(ai) area along the Daoqing Railway, protected grain and conscripted soldiers, eliminating over 140 enemy soldiers. On the 25th, the enemy, divided into several routes, raided villages along the Xiu-Bo Highway and the Daoqing Railway, including Dayou Village, Xiaonie Village, Ningguo Village, Dajia Village, Yangyimiao Village, Sujiazou Village, Laojunmiao Village, and Xiaoliangzhuang Village, looting grain and conscripting soldiers, also attempting to invade Bo'ai City. Upon hearing this, our sub-district's main force and the Xiu-Huo-Wu Battalion launched attacks along different routes. One route engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the Xiaoliangzhuang and Laojunmiao areas, forcing the enemy to retreat to their lair, leaving behind over 30 corpses, by 3:30 PM, killing and wounding over 70 enemy soldiers. Another route of our army engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the Ningguo, Dayou Village, and Yangyimiao areas for two or three hours, repelling the enemy, killing and wounding over 60 enemy soldiers, and capturing 7 alive. In total, this battle resulted in over 130 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 10 captured alive, and the seizure of 8 rifles, 1 pistol, and some ammunition and other supplies.

[Taihang News] In February, the main forces of our Second, Fourth, and Fifth Military Sub-districts and the local armed forces of various border counties achieved continuous victories in the struggle to combat the Chiang-Yan bandits' looting of grain and conscription of soldiers, and protect the interests of the masses in the border areas. Especially recently, our sub-district troops have combined armed force with political offensives, actively penetrating deep into enemy territory, and have achieved significant results in disintegrating secret societies and their reactionary armed forces in northern Henan and central Shanxi.
