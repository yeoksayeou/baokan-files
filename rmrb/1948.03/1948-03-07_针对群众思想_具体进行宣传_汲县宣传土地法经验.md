　　Targeting the Masses' Thinking
  　Specifically Conducting Propaganda
  　The Experience of Jixian County in Promoting the Land Law
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the Lunar New Year, Jixian County's First District has been fully engaged in Land Law propaganda. The approach involves understanding the general and specific thinking of the masses by visiting poor laborers and asking about their lives and suffering. The Land Law is explained to them. Addressing the misconceptions of middle peasants regarding the Land Law and the general idea of "equal division," policies are explained to stabilize their production morale. Currently, the following experiences have been gained: (1) Middle peasant households are generally afraid of having their movable property touched, especially livestock and farm implements. It is essential to affirm and propagate that the movable property of middle peasants will not be touched. (2) In addition to general propaganda, it is even more important to understand the masses' thinking and conduct propaganda targeting specific ideas. This approach is more effective. (3) The ways of speaking to landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants must be separated. It is not appropriate to say "landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, etc." in a continuous string, as this easily makes the middle peasants confused. At the same time, saying "affluent middle peasants" is not as good as saying upper-middle peasants, because the word "rich" is also present in "rich peasant," and the word "rich" is also present in "rich middle peasant," so the masses are often confused. (Jixian Small Newspaper)
    [News from Changzi] After the Land Law was issued, some people were temporarily confused, and their thoughts were chaotic, leading to eating, drinking, and waste. At the Mule and Horse Fair in Shizhe Town, many people ate and drank extravagantly. For example, an old man from Xibaotou sat in a restaurant and said, "Eat it all! The mice are saving it for the cat!" People at the livestock market said, "We don't even know who the land belongs to yet! Who wants this stinky stuff!?" Comrade Song Wudi, the Fourth District Secretary, addressed this phenomenon by using gatherings and opera performances to conduct propaganda to the masses, making it clear that the spirit of the Land Law Outline is not to disrupt and divide equally, nor to harm the interests of middle peasants. After listening, the masses had a slightly better understanding than before. Currently, each district in the county is holding village cadre meetings to vigorously carry out Land Law propaganda to the masses. The Wenguang Opera Troupe of No. 1 Elementary School has been going to the countryside for days to perform operas to promote the Land Law, so that the masses can concentrate on spring plowing.

　　针对群众思想
  　具体进行宣传
  　汲县宣传土地法经验
    【本报消息】汲县一区从旧历年以来，即全力进行土地法宣传，方式是从访问贫雇生活、痛苦等情况中了解一般的群众思想及具体思想，把土地法说给他们知道，并针对中农对土地法的误解，和笼统“平分”的思想，说明政策，安定他们生产情绪，目前已取得几点经验：（一）中农户普遍怕动他的浮财，特别是牲口、农具。必须肯定，宣传坚决不动中农的浮财。（二）除了一般宣传外，更重要的是摸群众思想，针对具体思想宣传，效力就更大。（三）对地主、富农、中农的说法，必须分开，不能说成地主、富农、中农等一连串下来，这样容易使中农听了含糊。同时说“富裕中农”不如说成上中农，因为富农亦有个“富”字，富中亦有“富”字，群众往往弄不清。（汲县小报）
    【长子消息】土地法下来后，有些群众一时闹不清楚，思想混乱，吃喝浪费。石哲镇骡马大会上，不少人大吃大喝浪费，如西堡头一个老汉坐在饭铺说：“瞎吃吧！老鼠给猫攒哩！”六畜市上的人说：“地还不知道谁的呢？那个人要这些臭东西！？”四区分书宋务迪同志，针对这种现象，利用集会唱戏的场合，向群众进行宣传，明说土地法大纲的精神不是打乱平分，也不伤害中农利益，群众们听了以后，才较前稍有认识。现本县各区都分别召开村干部会议，大力向群众展开土地法宣传。一完小文光剧团，连日下乡演剧宣传土地法，使群众安心进行春耕工作。
