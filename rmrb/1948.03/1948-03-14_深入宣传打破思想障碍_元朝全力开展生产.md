　　Deepen Propaganda to Break Down Ideological Obstacles
  　Yuan Dynasty Goes All Out for Production
    [Yuan Dynasty News] After the Land Committee's land conference, cadres came back with a surge of enthusiasm to agitate for equal land distribution. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, poor peasants happily waited for the equal distribution. Middle peasants were generally afraid of disrupting the equal distribution and dared not haul manure, thinking, "I don't know which plot of land will be mine!" Rich middle peasants were afraid of touching floating assets and said, "It would be better to dedicate land during the rent reduction campaign; now that landlords and rich peasants are being struggled against, this time it's our turn." Village cadres were not assessing the situation, some saying: the old cadres have all been transferred away, and the new cadres don't know about our past merits, only seeing our mistakes, and are not enthusiastic about us. Some said: the county and district cadres are rectifying things quite severely, and we can't escape it either. Some with major mistakes are trying to win over poor peasants to organize fake poor peasant groups. Landlords and old rich peasants generally dispersed their belongings, pretended to be enlightened. Guo Ruixiang, a landlord in Sucun, Fifth District, treated village cadres to wine and meat. Some spread rumors saying "disrupt equal distribution." Li Fujing, a bankrupt landlord in Quanzhuang, Fourth District, used the contradictions among village cadres to organize fake poor peasant groups. Based on the above ideological situation, the county convened a county-wide cadre meeting on the 5th of this month, deciding to launch a propaganda blitz week. The propaganda content pointed out: the central task of our county in the first half of the year is production, and whoever plants the crops gets to harvest them; correctly interpret the Land Law, explaining that equal distribution does not mean disrupting equal distribution, poor peasants should be appropriately compensated, middle peasants are generally untouched, and rich middle peasants must agree to give up some of their surplus land, but floating assets are definitely not touched. To prevent sabotage, publicize the seven prohibitions of the Jinnan Administrative Office. In terms of propaganda methods, it was pointed out that cadres and schools should all participate in this propaganda movement. Cadres going down to the villages should first convene village cadre meetings, then convene mass meetings in selected villages, and use various methods to solve the ideological problems of the masses. In terms of production content, it was said that the spring season is short and it is necessary to quickly deliver manure and plow the land, call for planting more special products, each person planting a tree, reclaiming wasteland, call for women to participate in agricultural labor, and organize weaving in their spare time. Organizationally, it was proposed to mobilize poor and hired peasants, unite all middle peasants to carry out production, and supervise and encourage landlords to produce. Mutual aid teams should genuinely achieve voluntary combination. In terms of cadre style, it was proposed to oppose bureaucratic commandism. The propaganda movement is now being carried out in various districts.

　　深入宣传打破思想障碍
  　元朝全力开展生产
    【元朝消息】地委土地会议结束后，干部一股热气回来闹平分，土地法大纲发出后，贫农高兴等待平分，中农普遍怕打乱平分，不敢拉粪，“不知那块地是咱的哩”？富中农怕动浮财说：“还不如查减时献田哩，现在地主富农斗了，这次又轮到咱头上”。村干部则不摸底，有的说：老干部都调走了，换的新干部对咱过去的功劳不知道，光看见错，对咱不热气。有的说：县区干部整的挺厉害，咱也脱不了。有的错较大的，则拉拢贫农组织假贫农团。地主和旧富农一般是分散东西、假开明，五区苏村地主郭瑞详，拿酒肉请村干部的客，有的造谣说“打乱平分”，四区劝庄破落地主李傅经利用村干矛盾，组织假贫农团。根据以上思想情况，本月五日县里召开了全县干部会，决定开展宣传突击周，宣传内容上指出：我县上半年的中心任务是生产，谁种的庄稼归谁收；正确的解释土地法，说明平分不是打乱平分，贫农要适当填补，中农一般不动，富裕中农多余的地得其同意拿出一部，浮财肯定不动。为了防止破坏，宣传冀南行署七大禁令。在宣传方式、方法上指出，干部、学校一律参加这一宣传运动，干部下村首先召开村干大会，然后召开片村群众会，到村则利用各种各样方式解决群众思想问题。在生产内容上说，今年春短要赶紧送粪犁地，号召多种特产物，每人植一棵树，开垦生荒，号召妇女参加农业劳动，剩余时间组织纺织。在组织上提出发动贫雇、团结全体中农开展生产，督促鼓励地主生产。互助组切实作到自觉自愿结合。在干部作风上提出反对官僚主义强迫命令。现各区正开展宣传运动。
