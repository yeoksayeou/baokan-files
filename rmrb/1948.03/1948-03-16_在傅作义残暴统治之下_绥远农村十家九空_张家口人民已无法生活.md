　　Suiyuan News: Fu Zuoyi's bandit gang recently admitted that under its tyrannical rule, the rural areas of Suiyuan are "scattered and desolate, nine out of ten families are destitute, everyone is uneasy, and every household is broken." In addition to frantically conscripting soldiers, the Fu bandits have recently increased exorbitant taxes and levies in Fengzhen, Liangcheng, Guisui and other places, such as "gun loan," "public wheat loan," "head-cutting tax," "horse-buying tax," and "village loan," totaling fifteen or sixteen kinds. In the Xiaobayingzi area of ​​Liangcheng, even sheep and chickens have to be taxed. Qingshuihe in southern Suiyuan was already extremely poor due to the Fu bandits' plunder, and coupled with widespread famine last year, most farmers are starving. However, the bandit gang shouted "Buckwheat hulls can still be squeezed for three taels of oil" and looted wildly. Wherever the bandit troops went, they rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and farmers, unable to survive, fled with their families.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinchaji, 14th: Zhangjiakou Dispatch: The people of Zhangyuan under Fu bandits' criminal rule can no longer live. The Fu bandits extort merchants extremely heavily. In addition to extorting various donations and taxes from shops and forcibly requisitioning mules and horses, even those pushing carts on the road have to pay a "road-pressing fee" of 50,000 yuan for a short trip from Zhangyuan city to Qili Tea House. Setting up small stalls in the open-air market also requires paying a land tax of 15,000 yuan per license, and 5,000 yuan for small cigarette stalls. Some merchants discussed before the Lunar New Year, "Let's close the door under the pretext of resting for the New Year!" (According to the Fu bandits authorities, shutdowns are not allowed casually on weekdays.) Another tyrannical act of the Fu bandits is conscription. All men aged sixteen to forty-five have to be trained and are ready to be conscripted at any time. The method is to divide every twelve people into a group, forcing one member of the group to sign up for the army, while the other group members bear the "mutual assistance fee," which is called "volunteer soldiers." Another method is drawing lots for conscription (actually designated by the village chief); a farmer in Baijiagou committed suicide with his entire family because the Fu bandit village chief forced him to become a soldier. The people of Zhang City, living in extreme pain, are looking forward day and night to the People's Liberation Army to rescue them.

　　在傅作义残暴统治之下
  　绥远农村十家九空
  　张家口人民已无法生活
    【新华社陕北十三日电】绥远讯：傅作义匪帮近供认在其暴政统治下之绥远农村已“零落凋蔽，十家九空，人人不安，户户家破”。傅匪除疯狂抓丁外，近在丰镇、凉城、归绥等地增加苛捐杂税，如“枪借款”、“公麦款”、“割头捐”、“买马捐”、“乡借款”等共达十五六种之多。凉城小八营子一带甚至羊、鸡也要上税。绥南之清水河在傅匪掠夺下，人民原来穷困已极，加以去年遍地灾荒，农民大多陷于饥饿，而匪帮竟高喊着“荞麦皮还榨油三两”，大肆抢掠。匪军每到一处，翻箱倒柜，农民以不能活命，纷纷举家逃亡。
    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】张家口通讯：傅匪罪恶统治下的张垣人民，均已不堪活命。傅匪对商人勒索极为繁重，除向商店勒索各种捐税及强征骡马外，甚至推小车的在马路上走一趟也要交“压道费”，由张垣市内到七里茶房很短一段路程就要交五万元。在露天市场摆小摊的也要交落地税，一个牌照每次交一万五千元，卖纸烟的小摊要交五千元。有些商人在阴历年前纷纷议论：“过年借休息名义关门吧！”（按傅匪当局平时不许随便停业）傅匪另一暴政，便是抓丁，凡是男子十六岁至四十五岁的都得受训，随时准备征调，办法是每十二人编一小组，强迫组内一组员去报名入伍，其他组员则负担“互助费”，就叫做“志愿兵”。另一办法，则为抽签抓丁（实际上是保长指定的）；白家沟一农民即因傅匪保长强迫他当兵，而全家自杀。张市人民在极端痛苦的生活中，正日夜盼望人民解放军拯救他们。
