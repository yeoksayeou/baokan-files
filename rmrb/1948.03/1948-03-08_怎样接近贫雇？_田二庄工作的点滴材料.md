　　How to Get Close to Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers?
    ——Excerpts from Work in Tian'er Village
    Su
    We welcome comrades from all parts of the border region who are participating in land reform work to exchange work experiences, exchange work opinions, study work problems, and gather opinions from various sources for common solutions. Whether it's systematic or fragmentary, materials or insights; whether you use the form of writing articles, writing letters, or writing communication diaries; whatever form is fine, just write out what you want to say; don't be bureaucratic and empty. Other comrades can also write letters to discuss if they have different opinions. Each place has its own specific circumstances, and the communications published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for everyone's reference.
    　　
　　Where is Your Ass Sitting?
    After studying land reform and going to the countryside, I was determined to live and eat in the homes of the poorest peasants and hired laborers, and humbly learn from the working people. When the higher authorities assigned me to Tian'er Village, the first hurdle was not knowing where the poor peasants and hired laborers were; finally, I found Yang Younian, a sheep worker of two generations, and through him, I met several poor brothers. I followed my plan to find a place to live. I went to Yang Yinshan, an old bachelor sheep worker. In the twelfth lunar month, his kang (a heated brick bed) was only covered with some straw, half a sheepskin, and a tattered thin quilt. After seeing this, the problem arose. Wouldn't my thick bedding, fur coat, and his ragged quilt be a satire of myself if put together? Let's change the bedding and come back. - This was a stumbling block to fulfilling my promise, and a bigger excuse was that I wanted to find a core figure to live with, so as to cultivate him as a future mass leader. It was my illusion to want to find such a person at once, divorced from the actual movement, but this fallacy delayed my time to get close to the masses. Fortunately, under the education of the Party, these thoughts were quickly defeated, and I moved to Yang Younian's house to live and eat together.
    Most of the villagers in the north live are middle peasants and cadres, while the south is like a "slum for poor peasants," with broken walls and chaos. After living here, I spent day and night with those "old logs" - poor peasants, sheep workers, small merchants, and carpenters.
    I knew that the relationship between cadres and the masses in the village was not good, the masses were afraid of the cadres, and the masses didn't know my background either. In order to reduce the concerns of the poor peasants and hired laborers, I didn't go to the village cadres' houses at first. Several times, the political director, Yang Yunfeng, came to find me, but I wasn't home. After I returned, the poor peasants asked me what the political director had talked about. One day, the village chief, Yang Changquan, came to talk to me, and several of them listened in the courtyard. After hearing that I wanted the village chief to follow the masses and that I was determined to support the masses, they were relieved. Later, after discussing with the poor peasants and getting their consent, another part of our comrades did branch work. At this time, they no longer suspected us. Anything related to the cadres must be told to the poor peasants first, and then go to the cadres, and they will think it's okay; otherwise, in the eyes of the poor peasants and hired laborers, you are standing on the cadres' side. Once, in the winter school, Comrade Wang, a district cadre, talked to the cadres without consulting with the poor peasants, and the poor peasants reflected: "The district cadre is still with those people."
    After gaining the trust of the poor peasants and hired laborers, and after they are sure that you will not support bad cadres, it doesn't matter if you interact with the cadres.
　　"Millennial Logs Can Shine"
    Yang Lao Zhuzi, a hired laborer who had only lost his temper twice in his life (due to severe oppression by landlords) - he is now sixty-two years old - only said when he first saw me that after the Eighth Route Army came, I turned over, got a house and land, and was very satisfied. He didn't say a second sentence. It seemed that he was afraid of the cadres and couldn't figure out my "background" (what is the policy towards village cadres). Later, I learned from other poor peasants that he was the most upright and thoughtful good person, and I also intentionally went to his house several times a day to chat, talking about drawing fat to replenish the lean, especially the poor peasants and hired laborers being masters. Because I spent day and night in the "slum," and they saw my relationship with the cadres, they spread a public opinion: "This time, the superiors are different from before (washing their faces and wiping them black). Lao Zhang lives in our south end and only talks to poor people." "Who used to live here!" Lao Zhuzi's heart was also changing. He looked at problems very "slowly" and carefully, not speaking or expressing his attitude easily, but Lao Zhuzi gradually took the initiative to find me for talks. More than a dozen poor peasants and hired laborers often discussed problems together, like a school, like a meeting, and also unlike. They formed a group naturally, led by Lao Zhuzi. At this time, the first hurdle of "fear of cadre retaliation" was overcome.
    When they became aware, they took action. Unexpectedly, the winter school became their battleground. For example, Yang Er Youren, the preferential treatment director, was of bad character, corrupt, and used his power (the political director's sectarianism) to bully people. The poor people criticized him in the winter school. This was a remarkable change; who dared to say a word in the past! The political director's four brothers, three nephews, and the village chief's two brothers mobilized this "swarm" to attack "Yang Sheng," a poor peasant with hooligan habits, in the winter school, trying to defeat the poor peasants in one fell swoop. Because Yang Sheng was at a disadvantage and the poor peasants were unprepared, he was attacked and couldn't lift his head. Only Lao Zhuzi and six others were the most steadfast. Lao Zhuzi withdrew from the meeting, and others remained silent in protest. Young poor peasant Yang Linsheng spoke out in defense. After the meeting, several poor peasants automatically conducted self-criticism, rectified the ranks, temporarily broke off contact with bad elements such as Yang Sheng, united the middle peasants, and strengthened their own strength. They put forward the slogan: "Millennial logs can shine." For several days, my doubts about whether these "old logs" were strong in fighting spirit were shattered. It is necessary to rely on the "old logs" of poor peasants and hired laborers to mobilize the broad masses to be masters of their own affairs and implement the Outline Land Law. This belief has become even more firm. When the cadre family launched a second "attack" on the poor peasants in the winter school, they were counterattacked by the poor peasants for three consecutive nights. Finally, their gunner, Zhang Tianyi, ran out of arguments and had to bow to the masses, admitting his crimes of organized and planned sabotage of the Land Law. The poor peasants won a complete victory. It was the first time in Tian'er Village that "old logs shone!" They said that the second difficulty of "we can't speak, we can't do things" began (only began) to be broken through by themselves.
    When electing members of the Poor Peasants' Association, out of the seven members we had predicted, two failed to be elected, one because of乱讲恋爱 (disorderly romantic affairs), and the other because of being unkind, a bit of a "炮 (cannon/blabbermouth)." The masses themselves elected two others, one who was loyal and honest, and one who was upright, resourceful, and eloquent. Only when our eyes are combined with the eyes of the masses can we find the leaders of the masses.
　　"Xingguo Survey" is a Good Teacher
    What should we talk about when visiting poor peasants and hired laborers? At first, we talked to poor peasants and hired laborers about the new spirit of the Land Law, enlightened their awareness, dispelled their worries, talked about family matters, and became acquaintances, gradually making them feel like they were family members. At this time, the investigation was only superficial. In the second step, we asked to investigate their economic situation and urgent needs, collect materials, and fill out forms (based on one person as a unit). Our form had a total of twelve items: (1) Name, age, class status. (2) Population, labor force. (3) Land - how many mu before rent reduction, before land reform, and after land reform? How many mu of good land, medium land, bad land, and garden land? (4) Houses. (5) Livestock. (6) Cooperative shares. (7) Sideline occupations, capital and interest. (8) How much fruit was distributed during land reform? (9) Furnishings and farm tools. (10) What cadres and members are they? Are they Party members or family members of soldiers? (11) What grievances have they suffered? (12) Other. During the investigation, we studied Chairman Mao's "Xingguo Survey" and the "observation of eight families" in it, and made extremely precise and detailed calculations of each family's annual income and expenditure. This was of great educational significance to our comrades who were doing investigation work; after that, we changed the "other" item on the form to "overview of income and expenditure," and conducted preliminary accounting for each family. In this way, the economic and political situation and urgent needs of each family were found. For example, Yang Younian, a sheep worker with a family of six, had six mu of land the year before last. After land reform last year, it increased to more than seventeen mu. Because the land was bad, the turn over was late, and the labor force was weak, he only harvested nine shi six dou and eight sheng of grain last year. Public grain expenditures and debt totaled eleven shi and one dou, leaving a shortage of more than one shi of grain! If we don't do detailed accounting, from the surface, he seems to have turned over too much.

　　怎样接近贫雇？
    ——田二庄工作的点滴材料
    苏
    我们以最大的篇幅，欢迎边区各地参加土地改革工作的同志们交流工作情况，交换工作意见，研究工作问题，集中多方面意见然后加以共同解决。系统的也好，片断的也好，材料也好，心得也好；用写文章的形式也好，写信的形式也好，写通讯记日记的形式也好，不拘什么形式都好，把要说的话写出来就可以；千万不要党八股客里空。别的同志有不同的意见，也可以写信来讨论。一个地方有一个地方的具体情况，这里发表的通讯不一定对每个地方都适用，但可供大家参考。
    　　
　　屁股坐在那里？
    土改学习下乡后，我下定决心要在最贫苦的贫雇农家里住宿与吃饭，虚心向劳动人民学习。当上级派我到了田二庄，第一关就是不知贫雇农在那里；最后找到了一个两辈子的羊工杨有年，在他家认识了几个穷弟兄，我就按照我的计划找住处，我到另一个老光棍羊工杨银山家，腊月里他的炕上只铺着一些稻草，半截羊皮，一条稀烂破的薄被子。看了之后，问题就出来了，如果我的厚被褥、皮大衣和他的破被子放在一块不是对自己一个讽刺吗？把被褥换换再来吧。——这是执行自己诺言的绊脚石，更大的借口是我想找到一个核心人物，住在他家，以便培养他为将来的群众领袖。脱离开实际运动想一下子就找到这样的人物是我的幻想，可是这个谬论就把我接近群众的时间推迟了。幸而在党的教育之下，很快的将这些思想打垮，搬到杨有年家住宿与一起吃饭了。
    这个村子北头住的多是中农与干部，南头象个“贫农窟”，断垣残壁，乱七八糟。我住在这里之后，昼夜与那些“老木头”——贫农、羊工、小商人、木匠们来往。
    我知道村里干群关系不好，群众对干部害怕，群众也不摸我的底，为了减少贫雇农的顾虑，开始时我没有到村干部家去过，有几次政治主任杨云峰来找我，我没有在家，我回来后，贫农们纷纷问我政治主任谈的什么话；一天，村长杨常全来我这里谈话，他们几个人就在院子里听着，听到我要村长跟着群众走，我是坚决为群众撑腰的意思之后，他们放心了。后来和贫农们商量并经过他们同意之后，我们另一部分同志做支部工作，这时他们对我们不怀疑了。一切与干部有关的事情，必须先告诉贫雇农，然后再去找干部，他们就认为没有什么关系；反之，在贫雇农眼里你是站在干部立场上的。一次在冬学里，区干部王同志未与贫农商议即与干部谈话，贫农反映道：“区干部还是和人家一起的”。
    取得贫雇农的相信，贫雇确信你不会给坏干部撑腰以后，你再与干部来往也就没有关系了。
　　“千年木头能放光”
    一辈子（现年六十二岁）只发过两回脾气（因地主欺压太甚）的雇工杨老珠子，第一次见了我只说八路军来后，我翻了身，有了房子有了地，很满意。没说第二句话，看样子他是怕干部，又摸不着我的“底”（对村干部是什么政策）。以后我从别的贫雇农嘴里知道了他是最直正又有心眼的好人，我也有意的每天几次的去他家拉闲话，讲抽肥补瘦，特别是贫雇农当家。由于昼夜在“贫民窟”里混，他们又看见我与干部的关系，他们传出了一个舆论：“这一回上边和以前（洗脸擦黑）不一样了，老张住在咱南头，专找穷人说话”。“以前谁住在咱这里啊！”老珠子的心坎眼也在变化着，他看问题很“慢”，很慎重，不轻易说话，不轻易表示态度，但是老珠子逐日自动的来找我坐谈了。十几个贫雇农经常在一块讨论问题，是学校，是会议，又象又不象。他们以老珠子为首，自然的形成了一伙子，这时他们“怕干部报复”的第一关算是过来了。
    他们有了觉悟，便有了行动，没有想到冬学里成了他们的斗争场所。例如优抗主任杨二友人品坏，贪污腐化，仗势（政治主任的小宗派）欺人，贫民在冬学里向他进行了批评。这是个了不起的变化，过去谁敢哼一声！政治主任四弟兄三外甥，村长两弟兄看到贫农组织起来了，他们动员了这“一窝蜂”，在冬学里向有流氓习气的贫农“杨生”进攻，企图一举将贫农打击下去，由于杨生理短，贫农事先又无准备，被他们攻击的抬不起头来，只有老珠子等六人最为坚定，老珠子退出会场，其他人不吭气，以示抗议，青年贫农杨林生提出声辩。会后几个贫农自动检讨，整顿队伍，与坏分子杨生等人暂时断绝来往，团结中农，壮大自己的力量。他们提出口号：“千年木头能放光”。几天以来，我对这些“老木头”斗争性强不强的疑问被粉碎了。必须依靠贫雇农“老木头”，才能发动广大群众起来当家，实行土地法大纲，这个信念更进一步的坚定起来了。第二次干部家族在冬学里向贫农“进攻”时，被贫农边续三夜反击，最后他们的炮手张天义理屈辞穷，不得不向群众低头，承认其有组织有计划的破坏土地法的罪行，贫农完全胜利了。在田二庄开天辟地第一次“老木头放光”了！他们说“我们不会说话，不会办事”的第二个难关开始（仅仅是开始）被他们自己突破了。
    在选举贫农团委员时，我们预想的七个委员中，两个落选，一因乱讲恋爱，一因不厚道，有点“炮”。群众自己另选了两个，一个忠诚老实，一个正派，有心路能说话。我们的眼睛与群众的眼睛结合起来，群众的领袖才能找得到。
　　“兴国调查”是好老师
    访问贫农雇农，谈些什么呢？开始我们与贫雇农谈土地法新精神，启发觉悟，解除顾虑，谈家常，做个熟人，逐渐使他们感到是自家人，这时的调查只是浮皮潦草的东西。第二步我们要求调查他们的经济情况与迫切要求，搜集材料，填制表格（以一人为单位）。我们制的表格共有十二项（一）姓名、年龄、成份。（二）人口、劳力。（三）土地——减租前、土改前、土改后各几亩？好地、中地、坏地、园地各几亩？（四）房屋。（五）牲口。（六）合作社股金。（七）副业、资本与利钱。（八）土改中分到多少果实？（九）摆设（有具）与农具。（十）是啥干部、会员？是否党员、抗属？（十一）受过什么气？（十二）其他。在调查的时候，我们学习了毛主席的“兴国调查”里面“八家的观察”，对于每家一年收支状况都做了极端精确细密的计算。对我们做调查工作的同志教育意义极大；此后，我们才把表格上“其他”一项，改为“收支概况”，对每家初步的进行了算帐。这样一来，每家的经济政治情况与迫切要求就都找到了。例如羊工杨有年六口人，前年有六亩地，去年土改后，增加到十七亩多，因为地坏，翻身迟，劳力不强，去年共收九石六斗八升粮，公粮支差及欠债共支出十一石一斗，尚缺一石多粮！如果不细算帐，从表面看，他翻身还过高了呢。
