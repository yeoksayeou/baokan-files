【Taiyue News】According to the work report from the Third District of Qinyuan, although propaganda has been carried out in various villages since the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the incomplete explanations have caused misunderstandings among middle peasants. As a result, many phenomena of eating and drinking without working have occurred. Du Mingzhi and his wife in Dingyanggou consumed two bags of flour during the New Year. In addition, many middle peasants are not delivering manure to the fields. Zhang Wenzheng in Longquan Village is afraid that delivering manure to this plot of land will cause it to be divided away, and delivering it to that plot of land is also feared to lead to its division. Many people are like this. After specific explanations of the Land Law, ideological concerns were eliminated. Maquan Village organized 25 women, children, and old men to deliver manure, carrying it on their shoulders and pulling it in carts, delivering 7,254 loads of manure in five days. Xin Yi Village held a meeting of old men, which organized twelve ox carts to deliver manure. Huofeng Village delivered some manure last year and is continuing to deliver manure now, but production enthusiasm in individual villages is still not high. Cadres are now being assigned to carry out propaganda and lead production.
    【Taiyue News】Qina Village, Yangcheng First District, is stabilizing the mood of middle peasants and preparing for spring plowing. Some middle peasants misunderstood the Land Law, causing panic. Middle peasant Sun Laisuan (from Lin County) herded cattle for landlords from childhood. In the second year of the Republic of China, he fled to Qina Village in Yangcheng to work as a carpenter. He didn't understand the method of equal distribution under the Land Law, and threw away his brick trowel and stopped working. Wealthy middle peasant Wang Quanhe was afraid that his donkey would be divided, so he sent it to his relatives' home in Yaotou, using the excuse of a lack of grass to say he wanted to sell it. Most middle peasants fell behind in production and carried ideological burdens. The village chief saw this situation and, during the winter school, explained Article 6, Item B of the Supplementary Measures to the Land Law, that the middle peasants would not be touched, and that the wealthy middle peasants would be appropriately drawn from under the principle of extracting more to compensate for less, and extracting fertile to compensate for barren, and that their floating assets and houses should not be touched, as well as some news published in the newspapers. The middle peasants then put down their ideological burdens and are now studying the Land Law while carrying out spring plowing.

　　阳城沁源等地
  　中农不安心春耕
  　领导正想法解决
    【太岳消息】根据沁源三区工作汇报，自从土地法大纲宣布以后，各村虽然进行了宣传，但因解释的不彻底，引起中农误会，因此发生不少不劳动大吃大喝的现象。定阳沟杜明之两口人，过年就搬了两包面大吃起来。另外不少中农不往地里送粪，龙泉村张文正，怕送在这块地把这块地分走，送到那块地又怕把那块分走，象这样的人很多。经具体解释土地法，思想顾虑消除，马泉村组织了妇女、儿童、老汉二十五人送粪，担的担拉的拉，五天送粪七千二百五十四担。新毅村开了老汉会，就组织了十二辆牛车送粪。活凤村去年就送了一部分，现在正在继续送粪，但个别村生产情绪仍不算高，现正分配干部进行宣传领导生产。
    【太岳消息】阳城一区淇纳村，安定中农情绪，准备春耕。有些中农对土地法误解，引起了恐慌，中农孙来拴（林县人）从小给地主放牛，民国二年逃到阳城淇纳村作木匠活，不了解土地法平分办法，将修工使的瓦刀扔了不生产了。富裕中农王全河怕平分他的驴，送在窑头他亲戚家，借口没草说要卖。大多数中农生产落了后，背上了思想包袱。村长看到了这种情况，就在冬学上根据土地法补充办法第六条乙项，中农不动、富裕中农在抽多补少抽肥补瘦原则下酌于抽出，不得动其浮财及房屋，和报上登的一些消息进行解释，中农才放下了思想包袱，现在一面学习土地法，一面进行春耕。
