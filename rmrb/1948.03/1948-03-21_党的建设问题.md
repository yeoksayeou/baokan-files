    On Party Building
    By G.M. Malenkov, Secretary of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
    At the meeting of representatives of nine Communist Parties in Poland at the end of September 1947, G.M. Malenkov, Secretary of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), made a report on the work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The second part of the report is "On Party Building", the full text of which is as follows:
    The most prominent and important characteristic of our Party, and the foundation of its success, is its unbreakable prestige among the broad masses of our people and the sincere support of the Soviet people for our Party's policies. The Party's correct policies have guaranteed the consolidated unity of the Soviet people, both politically and spiritually. This has enabled our Party to organize the Patriotic War, defeat the enemy, and mobilize the entire nation to victoriously eliminate the serious consequences of the war. The political and spiritual unity of the Soviet people is profoundly and vividly manifested in the victory of the alliance of Party members and non-Party members in the elections of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union last year and the Supreme Soviets of the various republics and autonomous republics this year. The elections were conducted in a high degree of political enthusiasm. This once again proves the Soviet people's unlimited trust and support for our Party.
    The war demanded arduous and enormous sacrifices from the Soviet people. Of course, during the war, satisfying the urgent material and spiritual needs of the broad masses of the people was very limited. Therefore, in the transition from wartime to peacetime, it is necessary to take certain measures to lift these restrictions and ensure the satisfaction of the people's material and spiritual needs. Moreover, during and after the war, the political and cultural level of the broad masses of the Soviet people has been continuously improving. The Soviet people hope to satisfy their spiritual and material needs. All of this places new and higher demands on the Party's leadership and organizational work. With the end of the war and the shift to peace, the Party must conscientiously transform its organizational work in accordance with these new demands. This transformation is also necessary because significant shortcomings were found in the Party's organizational work that had not developed during the war. The first of these is the laxity of the Party's organizational work and ideological education work.
    The achievements of our Party and the fact that the Party and Soviet government cadres were tested in the fires of war should not make us complacent or satisfied with the existing achievements. On the contrary, the new tasks of economic and cultural construction facing our country after the war, and the current international environment as a whole, urgently require the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) to continuously improve the Party's ideological education work. Consolidating the Party's organizational work is one of the Party's most important tasks. During the war, the Party organs carried out enormous work: organizing the rear and converting the economy to a wartime footing. Under the conditions of war, the Party organs often had to do some economic management work. This was correct under the circumstances at the time. However, we cannot ignore the result of doing so, which is that certain undesirable phenomena have arisen in the Party's actual organizational work, namely, the relaxation of Party affairs work and the Party's substitution of the state's economic organs. This violates one of the basic principles of leadership of the Bolshevik Party. Now the Party has put forward the consolidation of local Party organizations and the strengthening of Party organizational work as one of the Party's main tasks. Improving the level of Party affairs work and improving the level of Bolshevik Party leadership of the state and leadership of economic work is one of the important tasks of our Party at this stage.
    To accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to unfold Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism; because criticism and self-criticism are the basic conditions for the development of our Party. The Party will continue to consolidate the Soviet state and will improve state institutions and government work as the Party's basic tasks. During the war, government organs made their best efforts to implement the instructions of the Party and the government. This is the result of the Party's long-term work in establishing flexible and accurate state institutions and cultivating government work cadres who are loyal to the Party's cause and have the necessary knowledge and organizational skills.
    At present, the primary work of state organs is to organize the economy and conduct cultural education, resolutely safeguard Soviet law, oppose the remnants of private ownership, continue to consolidate socialist public ownership, and improve state discipline in all fields of work. Under these circumstances, the Party has taken many measures to continue to consolidate state power organs, strengthen their organizational role in solving economic and cultural construction tasks, and further consolidate the ties between Soviet power organs and the masses. It is believed that the upcoming elections of local labor people's representative Soviets in our country will greatly improve the work of local Soviet power organs.
    The new tasks of Party and government work after the war have placed higher demands on Party cadres, and therefore it is urgently required that Party and government cadres must improve their ideological level and working ability. Training and cultivating Party and government work cadres in order to help millions of work cadres in Party and government organs master the science of Marxism-Leninism, to arm them with the knowledge of the laws of social development, with the knowledge of the national economy, and with the understanding of the Soviet state's economic policies. To arm them with knowledge of the new international situation and with an understanding of Soviet foreign policy - this is one of the greatest tasks that our Party is currently striving to achieve.
    In order to conscientiously improve the political and theoretical level of Party and government workers, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) believes that it is necessary within the next three or four years to enable the basic Party and government cadres of various republics, border regions, provinces, cities, and districts to study for a period of time in Party schools or training classes for Party and government workers. In order to achieve this goal, the Party has made great efforts to transform Party schools and Party training classes, and has established a high-level Party school with a three-year term to train Party and government workers in the provinces and border regions of the republics. Currently, there are nearly a thousand students studying at the school. In addition, under the high-level Party school, there are also various training classes with a nine-month term to train young provincial Party committee and border region Party committee secretaries, chairmen of the executive committees of the labor people's representative Soviets of the provinces, provincial and border region newspaper editors, and so on. Currently, there are more than 500 students receiving training in these training classes.
    At present, there are 177 such Party schools with a three-year term and training classes with a nine-month term in various republics, border regions, and central areas of provinces. Approximately 30,000 Party and government workers, Communist Youth League members, and newspaper workers are receiving training there. There is also the Academy of Social Sciences directly under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is responsible for training theoretical work cadres for the central organs of the Party, the central committees of the Communist Parties of various republics, the Party committees of various border regions, and the Party committees of various provinces, specialist professors in higher education institutions, theoretical workers in scientific research institutions and scientific journals. The Academy of Social Sciences specializes in training personnel with the following specialties: political economy, foreign economics and politics, state theory and law, international law, Soviet history, general history, international relations, history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), dialectical materialism and historical materialism, Russian history and Western European philosophy, ethics and psychology, literary theory and art theory. The duration of study at the Academy is stipulated as three years. Currently, there are approximately 300 people studying at the Academy.
    During the war and post-war periods, our Party achieved tremendous growth. Although the Party suffered great sacrifices on the front lines of the Patriotic War, during the war, the Party's ranks not only did not shrink, but expanded. If the Party had 3.8 million members and alternate members before the war, then it has now increased dramatically to 6.3 million. The number of Party members has almost doubled. These new Communist Party members all joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) during the war and post-war periods. Such a dramatic increase in the number of Party members is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of our Party. The vast majority of new Party members joined when the motherland was at a critical juncture of life and death. This means that the vast majority of new members joining our Party are the most steadfast elements of the people. (⑴⑵)
    Due to the Party's vigorous growth in numbers and changes in its composition, the issue of strengthening the political education of Communist Party members has been sharply raised. Most Communist Party members, especially those who have joined the Party in recent years, have not received the necessary political training. The political level of members and alternate members of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is extremely disproportionate to the growth in the number of Party members. Therefore, the current direction of the Party's efforts is not to continue expanding its ranks, but to conduct political education for members and alternate members in order to improve the political level of Communist Party members, because quality is ultimately more important than quantity. Studying the widely distributed biographies of Lenin and Stalin is of great significance for improving the political and ideological level of Communist Party members and for the cause of conducting communist education for the working people. In 1946, we resumed the work of publishing the complete works of Lenin, which had been interrupted by the war, and began publishing the complete works of Stalin, with 500,000 copies of each. In addition, after the war, 90 million copies of various classical works by Marx and Lenin were published; 1 million copies of Stalin's biography were published; and 10 million copies of the "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" were added to the 30 million copies published in the first edition.
    The task of building communism in our country is inseparable from the task of conducting communist education for the working people. Under the conditions of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism, conducting communist education for the working people and overcoming the remnants of capitalism in the people's ideology and consciousness is of decisive significance. Although international bourgeoisie has lost all the footholds from within the Soviet Union to oppose the Soviet state after we crushed and eliminated the remnants of the exploiting classes, they still attempt to use the remnants of capitalism in the ideology and consciousness of the Soviet people (the remnants of individual selfishness, the remnants of bourgeois morality, the flattering psychology of individual elements towards Western European bourgeois culture, nationalistic prejudices, etc.) to achieve their goals.
    The most important task in ideological and political education is to cultivate and develop the spirit of Soviet patriotism, as Comrade Stalin taught us: "The strength of Soviet patriotism lies in the fact that it is based not on racial and national prejudices, but on the infinite loyalty of its people to the Soviet motherland and the fraternal love of the working people of all nationalities in our country. Soviet patriotism harmoniously integrates the national traditions of the people of all republics with the fundamental interests of all workers in the Soviet Union." To develop Soviet patriotism, it is necessary to oppose narrow nationalism and chauvinism. The Party educates the Soviet people to respect other nationalities and to recognize the right of all nationalities to independent development.
    In recent years, the Party has had to wage a resolute struggle against various phenomena of flattering Western European bourgeois culture. These phenomena are quite common among certain intellectual strata in our country. This is also a remnant of the cursed past of Tsarist Russia. The Party has had to give resolute blows to those specific manifestations of flattery. Because at the current stage, these manifestations seriously threaten the interests of the Soviet state. The reason for this is that the agents of international reactionaries are attempting to use those who flatter bourgeois culture to achieve the goal of weakening the Soviet state. The October Revolution liberated the Russian people from the economic and spiritual enslavement of foreign capital. The Soviet regime for the first time built our country into a free and independent nation. Our people, by implementing the cultural revolution and establishing their own Soviet state, shattered the chain of the country's material and spiritual dependence on the Western European bourgeoisie, making the Soviet Union a pillar of world culture and progress. Under these circumstances, how can we allow the existence of flattery of foreign affairs? The root of this anti-patriotic behavior and thought is the remnant of the cursed past of Tsarist Russia. And this remnant still occupies a dominant position in the ideology and consciousness of some intellectuals in our country.
    Foreign capitalists, who had a strong position in Tsarist Russia, tried every possible means to support and transplant such ideas into Russia, that the culture and thought of the Russian nation were not worth valuing. The ruling class of Tsarist Russia, who were separated from the people and ran counter to the people, did not believe in the creativity of the Russian people, and did not allow Russia to get rid of this backwardness with its own strength. Hence, an incorrect idea was born, which held that Russia should always be a "student" of Western European "teachers." This stale remnant of capitalist thought is now being used by the agents of American and British imperialism, attempting to find within the Soviet Union a strong foothold for their espionage activities and anti-Soviet propaganda. These foreign spies are desperately trying to find weak spots to exploit among those intellectuals in our country who are not steadfast, who do not believe in their own strength, and who suffer from flattery of all foreign things. Thus, these people can easily become prisoners of foreign intelligence agencies.
    Under the current circumstances, the Party's ideological education work is aimed at continuously overcoming the ideological remnants of the bourgeoisie and strengthening the Bolshevik's uncompromising attitude towards all ideological degeneration. Here, the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the issue of ideological and political work (i.e., the Central Committee's resolutions on "Star" and "Leningrad Magazine" and the resolutions on theater performance programs, etc.), and the philosophical discussions held recently on the recommendation of the Central Committee, are of great significance. The purpose of these measures by the Party Central Committee is to ensure that the spirit of militant Soviet patriotism occupies a dominant position among scientists and artists, and to strengthen the Party spirit of Soviet science, literature, and art, and to raise all means of our socialist culture (publication, propaganda, science, literature, and art) to a new and higher level. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), after emphasizing the great social transformation role of literature and art, and their great role in conducting communist education for the people, especially in conducting correct education for young people (to educate the new generation of young people with courage, confidence in the cause of communism, and a spirit of not being afraid of difficulties and preparing to overcome all obstacles), pointed out that Soviet writers and art and culture workers have no other interests except the interests of the people and the interests of the country. That is why all doctrines of no ideological principle, separation from politics, and "art for art's sake" run counter to Soviet literature, are detrimental to the interests of the Soviet people and the Soviet state, and should not have their place in our newspapers and magazines. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that literature and art should take the Party's policy (which is the foundation of the life of the Soviet state) as the guide for their creative work.
    The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) warned the representatives of Soviet culture not to bow to the declining and disintegrating bourgeois literature and art. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) particularly emphasized the significance of fully developing principled and objective criticism. Because without such principled and objective criticism, Soviet literature and Soviet art cannot continue to move forward. In order to launch criticism against the shortcomings of various theoretical work departments, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) published a new newspaper - "Culture and Life" - as the organ of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In the summary of the philosophical discussion on Alexanderov's book "History of Western European Philosophy," which was held recently on the recommendation of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), it was found that there were many shortcomings in our country's theoretical front, especially in the editing work of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. In order to overcome these shortcomings and to promote the continued development of scientific theoretical work in the field of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, a new journal "Philosophical Questions" was published.
    At present, the Central Committee is formulating a new Party program for the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The current Party program of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is obviously outdated and should be changed. In addition to formulating a new Party program, the Central Committee is also revising the Party Constitution. Because in recent years, the domestic situation and the situation of the Party have undergone tremendous changes. Many articles of the Party Constitution are no longer applicable. (The End)

    党的建设问题
  　联共（布）书记马林可夫
    联共（布）书记马林可夫，在一九四七年九月底波兰九国共产党代表会议上，曾作了关于联共（布）中央委员会工作的报告。报告的第二部分为“党的建设问题”，全文如下：
    我党最突出最重要的特点及其成功的基础，就是它在我国人民大众中牢不可破的威信，和苏联人民对于我党政策的竭诚拥护。党的正确政策，保证了苏联人民政治与精神之巩固的统一。这就使我党有可能组织爱国战争，击败敌人，并发动全民胜利地消灭战争的严重后果。苏联人民政治、精神的统一，深刻鲜明地表现在党与非党联盟在去年苏联最高苏维埃和今年各加盟共和国与各自治共和国最高苏维埃选举中的胜利。选举是在高度的政治热情中进行的。这就再一次地证明了苏维埃人民对于我党的无限信任与拥护。
    战争要求苏联人民艰苦与巨大的牺牲。当然，在战争时期，满足人民大众迫切的物质与精神要求，是很受限制的。所以在由战时过渡到和平的时期，便需要采取若干措施，取消这些限制，保证满足人民物质的与精神的需要。而且在战时与战后，苏联人民大众的政治与文化水平，在不断的提高着。苏联人民希望满足自己精神的与物质的需要。所有这一切，便对党的领导与党的组织工作，提出了新的更高的要求。随着战争的结束与转向和平，党必须根据这些新的要求，认真的改造其组织工作。这种改造之所以必需，还因为在党的组织工作中发现了战时所没有发展的重大缺点。这首先就是党的组织工作与思想教育工作的松懈。
    我党的成绩，及党的与苏维埃政府的干部，在战火中经过了考验，这一点，并不能使我们骄傲，不能使我们安于既有的成绩。相反的，战后摆在我国面前的新的经济与文化建设任务，与目前整个国际环境，迫切要求苏联共产党（布）不断的提高全党的思想教育工作。巩固党的组织工作，是我党头等重要的任务之一。在战时，党的机关曾进行了巨大的工作：组织后方并将经济转入战时轨道。在战争的条件下，党的机关曾不得不经常作些管理经济的工作。这在当时的情况下，是正确的。但是，不能忽视这样做的结果，便在党的实际组织工作中，产生了某些不良的现象，就是放松了党务工作，而使党代替了国家的经济机关。这就是违背了布尔什维克党的基本领导原则之一。现在党提出了巩固地方党的组织，加强党内组织工作，作为党的主要任务之一。提高党务工作水平，提高布尔什维克党领导国家与领导经济工作的水平，这就是现阶段中我党工作的重要任务之一。
    要完成这些任务，就必须展开布尔什维克的批评与自我批评；因为批评与自我批评，是我党发展的基本条件。党将继续巩固苏维埃国家，将改善国家机构及政府工作作为党的基本任务。战争时期，政府机关在执行党与政府的指令上曾作了最大的努力。这乃是党在建立灵活准确的国家机构、培养忠于党的事业而又具有必要的知识与组织才能的政府工作干部上长期工作的结果。
    目前国家机关的首要工作，就是组织经济与进行文化教育，坚决维护苏维埃法律，反对私有制残余，继续巩固社会主义公有制，提高一切工作领域内的国家纪律。在这种情况下，党曾采取了许多措施，以继续巩固国家政权机关，加强其在解决经济与文化建设任务中的组织作用，进一步巩固苏维埃政权机关与群众的联系。相信我国最近即将举行的地方劳动人民代表苏维埃选举，必将大大改善地方苏维埃政权机关的工作。
    战后党与政府工作的新任务，对党的干部提出了更高的要求，因而也就迫切要求党政干部，必须提高自己的思想水平与办事能力。训练与培养党政工作干部，以便帮助党政机关内千百万工作干部掌握马克思——列宁主义的科学，以社会发展规律的知识，以国家经济的知识，与对苏维埃国家经济政策的了解去武装他们。以对新国际形势的知识与对苏维埃外交政策的了解，去武装他们——，这就是目前我党所正努力实现的最大任务之一。
    为认真提高党政工作人员的政治理论水平，联共党（布）中央委员会认为，必须在最近三四年之内，使各共和国、各边疆区、各省、各城市、各区的党政基本干部，在党校或党政工作人员训练班内学习一个时期。为达到这一目的，党曾作了很大的努力，以改造党校与党的训练班，建立了一座以三年为一期的高级党校，培养共和国的省的边疆区的党政工作人员。目前在该校学习者约近千人。此外，在该高级党校下，还附设各种以九个月为一期的训练班，以培养年青的省党委与边疆区党委书记、省的劳动人民代表苏维埃执行委员会主席、省的与边疆区的报馆编辑等等。目前在这些训练班内受训的学员，有五百多名。
    目前这种以三年为一期的党校、与以九个月为一期的训练班，在各共和国、各边疆区域、及各省中心区域，已有一百七十七座。在那里受训的党政工作人员、少共团员和报馆工作人员，约三万名。另设有直属联共党（布）中央委员会的社会科学院，负责培养党中央机关的、各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会的、各边疆区党委及各省党委的理论工作干部，高级学府的专科教授，科学研究机关及科学杂志的理论工作者。社会科学研究院专培养具有下列专长的工作人员：政治经济学、外国经济学与政治学、国家论与法律学、国际法、苏联历史、通史、国际关系、联共党（布）史、辩证唯物论与历史唯物论、俄罗斯历史与西欧哲学、伦理学与心理学、文学理论与艺术理论、学员在研究院学习期限，规定为三年。目前在该研究院学习的人约三百名左右。
    在战争时期与战后时期内，我党获得了巨大的增长。虽然党在爱国战争的前线上，曾遭受了很大的牺牲，但在战争期间，党的队伍不仅没有缩小，而且扩大了。如果党在战前拥有党员与候补党员三百八十万的话，那么现在则剧增至六百三十万了。党员几乎增加了一倍。这些新的共产党员，都是在战争期间和战后时期内加入联共党（布）的。党员数量之如此剧增，这是我党历史以来不曾有过的现象。新党员中的绝大多数，是当祖国正处在生死关头的时候加入的。这就是说，新加入我党的绝大多数，是人民中最坚定的分子。（⑴⑵）
    由于党在数量上的蓬勃增长及其成份的变动，便尖锐地提出了加强共产党员政治教育的问题。大部分共产党员，特别是在最近几年内加入党的人，都还没有受过必要的政治训练。联共党（布）党员和候补党员的政治水平和党员数量的增长，是极不相称的。因此，目前党的努力的方向，不是继续扩大其队伍，而是进行党员与候补党员的政治教育，以提高共产党员的政治水平，因为质量终究是比数量重要的。研究目前发行极广的列宁传与斯大林传，对于提高共产党员的政治、思想水平，及对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的事业，是有重大意义的。在一九四六年，我们已经恢复了被战争中断了的出版列宁全集的工作，并开始出版斯大林全集，每种全集的出版五十万册。此外，战后还出版马克斯、列宁各种古典著作，达九千万册；出版斯大林传，达一百万册；“联共党（布）史简明教程”战后增版一千万册，与初版合计，共出版三千多万册。
    在我国建设共产主义的任务，与对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的任务，是分不开的。在由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的条件下，对劳动人民进行共产主义的教育，克服人民思想意识中的资本主义残余，这是有决定意义的事。虽然在我国于粉碎和消灭剥削阶级残余之后，国际资产阶级已失掉了一切从苏联内部反对苏维埃国家的支力点，然而他们还企图利用苏联人民思想意识中的资本主义残余（个人私有心理的残余，资产阶级道德的残余，个别分子对西欧资产阶级文化的阿谀心理，民族主义的偏见等等），以达到自己的目的。
    在思想、政治教育中最主要的任务，就是培养与发展苏联爱国精神，如斯大林同志教导我们的：“苏联爱国主义的力量，在于它不是以种族与民族的偏见，而是以其人民对于苏维埃祖国的无限忠诚，与我国各民族劳动人民兄弟般的友爱为基础的，苏联的爱国主义，使各共和国人民的民族传统与苏联一切劳动者的基本利益，和谐的溶合在一起”。要发展苏联爱国主义，就必须反对狭隘的民族主义与沙文主义。党教育苏联人民尊重其他民族，承认各民族有独立发展的权利。
    近几年来，党曾不得不进行坚决的斗争，反对各种向西欧资产阶级文化阿谀谄媚的现象。这些现象，在我国某些知识分子阶层中，相当普遍的存在着。这也是可诅咒的过去沙皇俄罗斯的一种残余。党不得不给那些阿谀谄媚的具体表现以坚决的打击。因为在现阶段上，这种表现，严重的威胁着苏维埃国家的利益。其所以如此，是因为国际反动派的代理人，正企图利用那些向资产阶级文化阿谀谄媚的人，以达到削弱苏维埃国家的目的。十月革命将俄罗斯人民从外国资本的经济与精神的奴役下解放出来。苏维埃政权第一次将我国建成一个自由独立的国家。我国人民因实行了文化革命，与建立了自己的苏维埃国家，而打碎了国家在物质上、精神上依靠西欧资产阶级的连环，使苏联变成了世界文化与进步的支柱。在这种情况下，怎么能够容许对外国事务阿谀的现象存在呢？这种反爱国主义的行为表现及思想的根源，就是可诅咒的过去沙皇俄罗斯的残余。而这种残余，在我国某些知识分子思想意识中，还占据着压倒的优势。
    在沙皇俄罗斯据有强固地位的外国资本家，曾千方百计地支持并向俄国移植这样的观念，即俄罗斯民族的文化与思想是不值重视的。脱离人民并与人民背道而驰的沙皇俄罗斯统治阶级，不相信俄罗斯人民的创造力，不容许俄罗斯用自己的力量摆脱这种落后性，由此便产生了一种不正确的思想，认为俄罗斯应该永远做西欧“教师”的“学生”。这种陈腐的资本主义思想残余，现在正被美、英帝国主义的代理人利用着，企图在苏联内部寻找其进行侦察活动与反苏宣传的强固据点。这些外国侦探，极力想在我国那些不坚定的、不相信自己的力量的、对一切外国事物患阿谀病的知识分子中间，寻找薄弱的可以钻空子的地方。于是这些人就很容易变成外国侦探机关的俘虏。
    在目前情况下，党的思想教育工作方针，就是不断地克服资产阶级的思想残余，加强布尔什维克对一切思想蜕化之不可调和态度。在这里，联共党（布）中央委员会关于思想政治工作问题的决议（即中央关于“星”与“列宁格勒杂志”的决议及关于剧场上演节目的决议等等），和不久前根据中央委员会建议而举行的哲学讨论会，是有重大意义的。党中央委员会的这些措施，目的在保证使战斗的苏联爱国主义精神，在科学艺术工作者中占居统治的地位，而加强苏联科学、文学、艺术的党性，将我国社会主义文化的一切手段（出版、宣传、科学、文学、艺术）提到新的更高的水平。联共党（布）中央委员会于强调指出文学与艺术的巨大社会改造作用，及其对人民进行共产主义教育，特别是对青年进行正确教育（以勇敢对共产主义事业的信心，不怕困难准备克服一切障碍的精神，教育新生一代青年）的巨大作用后，又指出：苏联作家与艺术文化工作者，除了人民的利益、国家的利益之外，没有其它的利益。这就是为什么一切无思想原则、脱离政治、“为艺术而艺术”的说教，都是与苏联文学背道而驰；于苏联人民苏维埃国家利益有损，而不应在我国报章杂志中有它们的地盘的道理。联共党（布）中央委员会指出：文学与艺术应以党的政策（它是苏维埃国家生活的基础）为其创作工作的指南。
    联共党（布）中央委员会的决议，警告了苏联文化的代表们，要他们莫向日趋衰退、瓦解的资产阶级文学与艺术低头。联共党（布）中央委员会特别强调全面开展原则性的客观批评之意义。因为没有这种原则性的客观的批评，苏联文学与苏联艺术便不可能继续向前发展。为了对各理论工作部门的缺点开展批评起见，联共党（布）中央委员会特出版了一个新的报纸——“文化与生活”，作为联共党（布）中央委员会宣传部的机关报。在不久前，根据联共党（布）中央委员会的建议而举行的对亚历山大洛夫所著“西欧哲学史”一书的哲学讨论会总结中，发现在我国理论战线上，特别是在马克思——列宁主义哲学编辑工作中，存在着许多缺点。为了克服这些缺点，为了促进马克思——列宁主义哲学领域中的科学理论工作之继续发展，出版了一种新的“哲学问题”杂志。
    目前中央委员会正在制定联共党（布）的新党纲。联共党（布）的现行党纲，显然已经过时了，应当予以改变。除制定新党纲外，中央委员会对党章亦正在进行修改。因为最近几年来，国内情况与党的情况已起了巨大的变化。党章的许多条文已经不适用了。（完）
