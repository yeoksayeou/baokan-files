　　The Blood Debt of the "Marshall Plan" in Indonesia
　　Zhang Shangming
　　The signing of the "Renville" truce agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands and the formation of the Hatta cabinet signify that the Indonesian right-wing group represented by Hatta and Sukiman has succumbed to "Wall Street pressure." At the same time, it also means the complete exposure of the "Marshall Plan" before the Indonesian people.

　　The U.S. Communist Party's organ, "The Daily Worker," disclosed that in order to destroy the newly born Republic of Indonesia, the United States supplied the Netherlands with a large amount of "surplus materials" at a low price of one U.S. dollar per ton, and U.S. ships transported Dutch troops to Indonesia. According to Marshall's statement on July 23rd last year: "The United States trained and equipped a whole brigade of Dutch troops," supplying them with "a total of only fifty-four bombers, sixty-four fighter planes, two hundred and twenty-six mortars, one hundred and seventy artillery pieces, and one hundred and fifty-nine machine guns." However, judging from the materials of the Soviet writer Preyshevsky in October last year, the actual situation far exceeded Marshall's confession. The fact that more than fifty American-made "Sherman" tanks were concentrated in Batavia alone is clear evidence. Obviously, since the British troops withdrew from Indonesia (but Britain still continues to train Dutch troops in large numbers in the British Isles and Malaya; according to the British Secretary of War, the United States has trained and equipped as many as 60,000 Dutch troops, and Britain uses the Singapore naval port as the main supply base for the Dutch army), especially after the Netherlands launched a full-scale war of aggression against Indonesia, the collusion between the United States and the Netherlands in aiding the Dutch has become increasingly rampant. U.S. military personnel even directly helped the Netherlands complete various military facilities (such as Colonel Lom of the 13th Reconnaissance Squadron of the U.S. Air Force, who was ordered to go to Celebes to build an airport). By the end of November last year, the number of Dutch troops trained by the U.S. (British) had increased from 100,000 at the beginning of the war to 141,000. Since then, the Netherlands has continued to send reinforcements, but without U.S. economic aid, the Netherlands would not have been able to continue the war.

　　As everyone knows, the Dutch aggression against Indonesia costs three million U.S. dollars a day. By the end of September last year, the Netherlands had consumed 377 million U.S. dollars. Such huge war expenses cannot be borne by the shattered Dutch economy after World War II. Therefore, the Netherlands must sell its country and rely on U.S. dollars to save its life. According to the New York Times, as of June last year, U.S. loans to the Netherlands amounted to 355 million U.S. dollars, and the Netherlands obtained 100 million U.S. dollars from the U.S. vassal, Canada. Less than a month after the outbreak of the Indonesian-Dutch war, regardless of the opposition and protests of the people inside and outside the United States, the "World Development Bank" controlled by the United States loaned the Netherlands another 195 million U.S. dollars. Another U.S.-Dutch loan negotiation was held after the Dutch plan to "solve the Indonesian problem in two months" was defeated by the Indonesian people. In mid-December last year, American monopoly capitalists agreed to lend the Netherlands 400 million U.S. dollars for a period of three years. As the Dutch democratic newspaper stated, most of the U.S. dollar loans were invested in adventurous aggression by Dutch war merchants.

　　On the one hand, the United States repeatedly transfuses blood to the dying Dutch imperialism; on the other hand, it colludes with the Netherlands to heavily blockade the Indonesian liberated areas. In the past year or so, no UN relief supplies have been transported to the Indonesian liberated areas (TASS News Agency, December 2nd last year); moreover, with the consent of the United States, medicines transported to the Indonesian liberated areas by the Soviet Red Cross and other countries sympathetic to Indonesia were completely confiscated unreasonably by the Dutch colonial authorities.

　　In politics, the central activity of U.S. imperialism is to internally divide the forces of the Indonesian independence movement. After the Security Council accepted the accusations of India and Australia, the United States changed its past barbaric attitude of preventing the Security Council from discussing the Indonesian issue and adopted steps to deliberately manipulate the Security Council. On the one hand, it colluded with its lackeys such as Britain, France, Chiang Kai-shek, and Belgium to oppose the just proposals put forward by the world democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and organized the U.S. imperialist-controlled "mediation" mechanism; on the other hand, it exerted pressure to force pro-American compromising elements in Indonesia to surrender, while fully supporting the Dutch separatist movement. The so-called Three-Nation Mediation Committee is denounced by Indonesian democrats as: merely establishing "a puppet government completely dependent on Wall Street," "helping the Dutch enslave the Indonesian people," and preparing "ground for Wall Street's expansion in Indonesia."

　　The United States also took anti-Indonesian people measures at other international conferences. For example, refusing Indonesia to participate in the Far East Asian Economic Commission is one example.

　　The United States has aided the Netherlands with less than one billion U.S. dollars in total, but it has plundered most of Indonesia's important resources. Before the war, the U.S. economic status in Indonesia was second only to the Netherlands and Britain. Of the 4.8 billion guilders of foreign investment in Indonesia, the United States only accounted for 380 million guilders (that is, less than 8 percent). According to "World Report" on July 15th last year, U.S. investment in Indonesia after the war increased to 500 million U.S. dollars (equivalent to 1.889 billion Dutch guilders). Mobil, Vacuum, and other oil companies have now controlled oil mines in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia; the activities of Detroit auto companies, "Santa Fe Railway Company," "United," and "Goodyear" rubber companies and other U.S. monopoly capital are "playing a more important role" than before the war. The resources that the United States has controlled or attempted to control also include tin in Bangka and Belitung, and iron, copper, lead and other minerals in New Guinea. In the past six months, a large number of Indonesian products (tea, sugar, grain, etc.) have been successively transported to the United States.

　　The expansion of the "Marshall Plan" in Indonesia is also manifested in the seizure of Indonesia's strategic locations. Soon after the news that MacArthur was responsible for "mapping" detailed maps of Indonesia came out, foreign news agencies recently confirmed that the Netherlands had auctioned the important military base "Buru Island" in New Guinea. All of these indicate the arrogant ambition of the United States to turn Indonesia into a "second Philippines."

　　The U.S.-Dutch war against the Indonesian people brought unprecedented disasters to the Indonesian people. The Dutch army implemented a policy of "burn all, kill all, loot all" in the Indonesian liberated areas, no less than the Japanese invaders. Tens of millions of Indonesian people sacrificed in the artillery fire, and the value of the factories and houses burned down was more than 1.5 billion guilders. The Dutch-occupied areas have become a terrifying and dark prison for peaceful Indonesian residents. The Netherlands, fearing the resistance of the Indonesian people, has been wantonly arresting and killing Indonesian patriots. The Indonesian liberated areas faced severe material difficulties due to the Dutch blockade. "Tens of millions of Indonesian people are ragged and tattered. Adults can find some clothes, but children are completely naked. Diseases, especially skin diseases, are rampant" (Indonesian News Agency). The Indonesian "Liberation Daily" and "National Daily" denounced the Dutch despicable trick of using relief supplies as bait for political inducement. The Indonesian side protested to the Three-Nation Mediation Committee against the U.S.-Dutch economic blockade policy and demanded permission to obtain necessary material assistance from abroad. But this protest letter has been shelved.

　　The U.S.-Dutch war against the Indonesian people has also brought infinite tragic experiences to Indonesian overseas Chinese. Before the Indonesian-Dutch war, overseas Chinese in the Indonesian liberated areas (accounting for 80 percent of the total number of overseas Chinese in Indonesia) lived and worked in peace and coexisted peacefully with the Indonesian people. In order to undermine this harmonious relationship between the Chinese and Indonesian nations, to curb the widespread sympathy of overseas Chinese for the Indonesian war of independence, and especially to cut off the economic ties between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people, the United States and the Netherlands set up a trap to instigate mutual killing between the Chinese and Indonesian nations. Chiang Kai-shek not only colluded with his American masters, but also repeatedly covered up the atrocities for the U.S. and Dutch imperialists, and completely blamed the crimes of a few Indonesian national scum and the fifth column of the Netherlands on the Indonesian people. The report of Chiang Kai-shek's military inspector on the war losses of overseas Chinese obviously attempted to eliminate the seriousness of the facts. He pointed out that in the four months from the outbreak of the war to October, a total of 7,000 overseas Chinese were killed and injured, 500 were missing, and in addition, 30,000 refugees were displaced. However, according to news from Sumatra, within half a month after the outbreak of the Indonesian-Dutch war, in the eastern region of Sumatra alone, more than 5,000 overseas Chinese were persecuted and more than 20,000 refugees were displaced. Many overseas Chinese were directly sacrificed under the Dutch butcher knives. The recent incident of the Dutch army killing 900 overseas Chinese is too numerous to mention. Therefore, the blood debt caused by the deterioration of Sino-Indonesian relations and the suffering of overseas Chinese should be fully borne by the United States, the Netherlands, and Chiang Kai-shek's slaves who pursue the policy of selling the country and flattering the United States.

　　The severity of the disasters suffered by overseas Chinese in Indonesia today cannot be compared with the 1740 "Red River Massacre" or the 1946 "Tangkiling and Wendeng Incident." The number of overseas Chinese who are displaced, exiled, starving, and dying is in the tens of thousands. According to the statistics of Cai Shien, the overseas Chinese representative in Indonesia attending the Security Council this February, the property losses of overseas Chinese amounted to more than one million guilders. The vast number of suffering overseas Chinese have not received any relief from the Chiang Kai-shek government.

　　The "Marshall Plan" was actually implemented when Graham was about to return to the United States. Hatta hosted a banquet to see him off, but he did roll out of Indonesian territory amidst the angry curses of the Indonesian people! The compromise and surrender of the Hatta-Sukiman right-wing ruling class is not enough to explain the disillusionment of the Indonesian independence movement, but it marks that the long-term struggle of the Indonesian people to liquidate the "Marshall Plan" and oppose the Dutch enslavement rule will be carried out more strongly on the new democratic cornerstone in the future.

　　“马歇尔计划”在印尼的血债
    张上明
    印荷“伦维尔”停战协定和哈达内阁之组成，意味着以哈达、苏基曼为代表的印尼右派集团，已经屈服在“菲尔街压力”底下。同时，也意味着“马歇尔计划”在印尼人民面前的总暴露。
    美共机关报“工人日报”披露过：为了摧毁新生的印尼共和国，美国曾以每吨一块美金低价，供给荷兰大量“剩余物资”，以及美轮运送荷军赴印尼等事实。据马歇尔去年七月二十三日的声明：“美国训练和装备荷军一个整旅”，供给荷军“一共只有五十四架轰炸机，六十四架驱逐机，二二六尊掷弹筒，一七○门大炮，一五九挺机关枪。”但是，从苏联作家普雷雪夫斯基去年十月间的材料看来，实际情况远超过马歇尔供词，普氏所举巴城一地就集中了五十多辆美制“歇尔曼”式坦克一事，即为明证。显然，自英军撤离印尼（但英国仍在英伦及马来亚继续大量训练荷军，据英陆相声称：美国训练和装备荷军数达六万名，英国并利用新加坡军港作为荷军之主要供应基地），尤其是荷兰向印尼发动全面侵略战争后，美国援荷勾当日益猖獗。美军事人员甚至直接帮助荷兰完成各种军事设施（如美空军第十三侦察队洛姆上校，就曾奉命赴西里伯斯筹建机场）。到了去年十一月底，美（英）训练的荷军数量，已由战争开始之十万名增至十四万一千名，此后荷兰仍不断增派援军，但是，如果没有美国的经济援助，荷兰还是不可能继续战争。
    众所周知，荷兰侵略印尼每天需费三百万美元，去年九月底止，荷兰已消耗三亿七千七百万美元。如此巨额战费，决非二次大战后荷兰破碎经济力所能担当，因此，荷兰必须卖国投靠美元救命。据纽约时报材料，截止去年六月，美国贷荷款项为数三亿五千五百万美元，荷兰从美国附庸加拿大获得一亿美元。印荷战争爆发不及一月，不顾美国内外人民的反对和抗议；美控制下的“世界开发银行”又贷荷一亿九千五百万美元。另一次美荷贷款谈判是在荷兰“两个月解决印尼问题”计划遭受印尼人民痛击而宣告破产后举行的，去年十二月中旬，美国独占资本家表示同意贷荷为期三年的四亿美元之贷款，正如荷兰民主报纸所称：美元贷款的大部分，被荷兰战争贩子投入冒险侵略。
    美国一方面替垂死的荷兰帝国主义一再输血，另一方面则勾结荷兰重重封锁印尼解放区。过去一年余来，联总救济物资无一件运往印尼解放区（塔斯社去年十二月二日讯）；不仅如此，在美国授意下，苏联红十字会及其他同情印尼的国家运往印尼解放区的医药品，完全被荷兰殖民地当局无理没收。
    在政治上，美帝国主义的中心活动，便是从内部分化印尼独立运动的势力。当安理会接受印、澳控诉后，美国一改过去阻止安理会讨论印尼问题的横蛮态度，而采取蓄谋操纵安理会的步骤。一方面勾结英、法、蒋、比等喽罗，反对以苏联为首的世界民主阵营所提出之正义议案，并组织美帝国主义御用“调停”机构；另一方面则施用压力向印尼亲美妥协分子逼降，同时以全力支持荷兰的分裂运动。所谓三国调停委员会，印尼民主人士斥为：不过是建立“一个完全依赖华尔街的走狗政府”，“助荷奴役印尼人民”，并为“华尔街在印尼的扩张准备地盘”的工具。
    在其他国际会议上，美国同样采取反印尼人民之措施。如拒绝印尼参加远东亚洲经济委员会，便是一例。
    美国援荷一共不到十亿美元，但它掠夺了印尼大部重要资源。战前美国在印尼的经济地位次于荷、英。在外国投资印尼总额四十八亿盾中，美国只占三亿八千万盾（即百分之点八弱）。而据“世界报导”去年七月十五日统计，战后美国投资印尼数增至五亿美元（折合荷币十八亿八千九百余万盾），美孚、谷牌等石油公司，现已控制苏岛及其他印尼油矿；底特律汽车业公司、“圣他菲铁道公司”、“合众”、“古立德”树胶业公司等美国垄断资本的活动，都比战前“扮演更重要的角色”。美国已控制或企图控制的资源，还包括邦加、勿里洞的锡，新几尼亚的铁、铜、铅等矿产。近半年来，已有大量印尼物产（＠、糖、粮食等）陆续运美。
    “马歇尔计划”在印尼的扩张，还表现在对印尼战略要地的攫夺。由麦克阿瑟负责“测绘”印尼详图消息传出不久，外国通讯社最近即证实荷兰拍卖了新几尼亚的重要军事基地“布鲁岛”，所有这些，表明了美国要把印尼变为“菲列宾第二”的狂妄野心。
    美荷反印尼人民的战争，带给印尼人民以空前大灾难，荷军对印尼解放区施行不下于日寇的三光政策，成千万的印尼人民牺牲在炮火之中，被焚毁的工厂房屋值十五亿盾以上。荷占区已成为印尼和平居民恐怖和黑暗的监狱，荷兰因惧于印尼人民的反抗，大肆捕杀印尼爱国分子。印尼解放区因荷兰之封锁曾面临着严重的物质困难。“数千万印尼人民衣饰破烂不堪，大人虽可找获一点衣着，但小孩则已完全裸体，疾病尤其是皮肤病正猖獗流行”（印尼通讯社）。印尼“解放报”、“民族报”痛斥荷兰以救济物资为饵进行政治诱降的卑鄙勾当。印尼方面曾向三国调停委会抗议美荷经济封锁政策，要求允许自国外取得必有的物资援助。但这一抗议书一直被束之高阁。
    美荷反印尼人民的战争，也给印尼侨胞带来了无限悲惨的境遇。印荷战争前，印尼解放区侨胞（占印尼华侨总数百分之八十）安居乐业，与印尼人民和平共处，为了破坏中印民族这一融洽关系、遏止侨胞对印尼独立战争的普遍同情，特别是割断华侨和印尼人民的经济上的联系，美荷便布置中印民族相互撕杀的陷阱，蒋贼不仅与其美国主子狼狈为奸，并且为美荷帝国主义一再掩盖暴行，把少数印尼民族败类及荷兰第五纵队的残害罪行，完全加诸于印尼人民身上。蒋贼军事视察员调查华侨战争损失的报告，显然妄图消灭事实的严重性，他指出：自战争发生至十月四个月间，共计杀伤侨胞七千名，失踪五百名，此外尚有三万名难侨流离失所。但据苏岛来鸿，印荷战争发生后半月内，仅苏东区一隅，被迫害之侨胞就达五千余名，难侨为数二万名以上。有许多侨胞直接牺牲在荷兰屠刀下，最近荷军杀害九百侨胞的事件实不胜枚举。因此，造成中印关系恶化及侨胞饱尝浩劫的血债，应由美荷及奉行卖国媚美政策的蒋奴完全负责。
    印尼侨胞今天所受祸害之惨重，不是一七四○年“红河血案”、或一九四六年“坦基隆、文登事件”所能比拟。颠沛、流亡、饥寒、死亡的侨胞数以万计。据印尼列席安理会华侨代表蔡石恩今年二月的统计，华侨财产损失数达一百万盾以上之巨。广大受难侨胞丝毫得不到蒋政府的救济。

    “马歇尔计划”实际执行在格拉罕于返美前夕，哈达曾设宴欢送，但他确实是在印尼人民怒骂声中，滚出印尼国土的！哈达、苏基曼右派统治阶级之妥协投敌，不足以说明印尼独立运动的幻灭，而是标志着印尼人民清算“马歇尔计划”和反荷奴役统治的长期斗争，今后将在新的民主基石上更顽强的开展。
