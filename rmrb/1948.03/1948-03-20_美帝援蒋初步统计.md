　　Preliminary Statistics on US Imperialist Aid to Chiang Kai-shek

After the US imperialists proposed the 1948 aid plan to Chiang Kai-shek, the US State Department, in order to prove that the United States' "military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war was much greater than generally understood" (Marshall's words), successively announced two long-standing secret military aids to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, namely the "Eight and One-Third Air Force Plan" approved by the US government on June 27, 1946, and the secret "Defense Assistance" of more than 777.63 million US dollars from the end of the war against Japan to June 30, 1947. These two secret aids were started and continued precisely during Marshall's "mediation" in China. Marshall has now confessed that his real work in China was to help Chiang Kai-shek prepare to launch a great civil war to massacre the Chinese people. In addition to helping Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of military supplies and weapons, he also "constantly provided advice to the Chinese (Chiang bandit) government on how to improve its combat forces." This thoroughly exposed the shameless lie in his "Declaration of Leaving China" last January that "I negotiated in China to promote peace and democracy in China."

Since the victory in the war against Japan, in order to encourage the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to carry out the civil war of massacring the Chinese people and turn China into a US colony, the loans and material assistance given to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, according to existing materials, have reached 4,640,498,223 US dollars. The assistance during the Anti-Japanese War was 1,567,800,000 US dollars. In fact, most of this assistance was retained by the Chiang bandits as capital for launching a civil war after the Anti-Japanese War. The total of the two items is 6,208,298,223 US dollars. The detailed items are as follows:

During the Anti-Japanese War:

　　(A) Loans:

　　1. Tung oil loan of 25 million US dollars on February 8, 1939.

　　2. Yunnan-tin loan of 20 million US dollars on March 7, 1940.

　　3. Tungsten ore loan of 25 million US dollars on September 25, 1940.

　　4. Credit loan of 50 million US dollars on December 1, 1940.

　　5. Exchange stabilization fund loan of 50 million US dollars on December 1, 1940.

　　6. Financial loan of 500 million US dollars on February 7, 1942.

　　(The above six items are based on the US State Department's "Aid to China Report" on April 15, 1944.)

　　7. Credit loan of 12.8 million US dollars in March 1939.

　　8. Aircraft company loan of 15 million US dollars in March 1939. (The latter two items are based on Jia Shiyi's article in the 5th volume and 4th issue of "Financial Review" in 1941. Jia's material source is the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance.)

　　The total of the above eight loans is 697.8 million US dollars. Among them, it is known that items 1, 2, 3, and 7, 8 have been repaid by the Chiang bandit government with Chinese strategic materials such as tin, antimony, and tungsten by the end of 1947. The credit loan of 50 million US dollars in 1940, according to the announcement by the Chiang bandit embassy in the United States on the 20th of last month, has also been repaid with the above strategic materials.

　　(B) Materials:

　　The item of lease materials is calculated at 870 million US dollars. (According to Truman's policy statement on China in December 1946).

This is stipulated in the "Sino (Chiang) US Mutual Assistance Agreement" in June 1942. The original number was 1,565 million US dollars, of which 870 million US dollars were agreed upon before the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and some were actually delivered to the Chiang government after the Anti-Japanese War. The remaining part was completely delivered to the Chiang government after the Anti-Japanese War, so it should be counted as part of the US aid after the Anti-Japanese War.

　　The above loans and materials total 1,567.8 million US dollars.

In Marshall's report to the US Congress on the 1948 aid plan to Chiang Kai-shek on February 20, the figure of aid to Chiang during the Anti-Japanese War was listed as 1,469.4 million US dollars, excluding the five loans of 97.8 million yuan that had been repaid before the end of 1947. If that part is removed, it is 1.47 billion yuan, which is roughly the same as Marshall's figure.

In the above aid to Chiang projects: First, the vast majority of the lease materials delivered at and after the end of the Anti-Japanese War were retained for use in the civil war after the Anti-Japanese War; Second, of the financial loan of 500 million US dollars, 155 million US dollars were used after the Anti-Japanese War (according to the Associated Press on January 25 this year, citing US official materials); Third, the used part of the financial loan and the exchange stabilization fund loan were retained as foreign exchange funds and continued to be used after the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, most of the loans and materials from the US and Chiang during the Anti-Japanese War became the capital for the Chiang bandits to launch a civil war after the Anti-Japanese War.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War:

　　(A) Loans:

　　1. Various cotton loans totaling 67 million US dollars.

　　2. Loan to improve seaports of 15 million US dollars in May 1946 (disclosed by Kirk at a press conference in Qingdao on November 12, 1946 - Associated Press).

　　3. Ship loan of 16.5 million US dollars in April 1947 (announced by the US Shipping Administration Committee on the 24th of last month).

　　4. Chiang-US "Relief Agreement" on October 27, 1947, stipulating a relief loan of 27.7 million US dollars to Chiang.

　　5. The US Congress passed "Temporary Assistance" of 18 million US dollars on December 19, 1947.

　　The total of the above five items is 144.2 million US dollars.

　　(B) Materials:

　　1. Lease materials of 694 million US dollars (according to the US Department of Commerce "Foreign Business Weekly" on February 1, 1947, that is, the total amount of lease materials in 1942 that was not agreed upon during the Anti-Japanese War).

　　2. The sale of Pacific surplus materials on August 30, 1946, with a cost of 837 million US dollars (selling price of 175 million US dollars. Same as the US Department of Commerce data above).

　　3. The "Eight and One-Third Air Force Plan" on June 28, 1946, including the cost of aircraft, equipment, and training expenses totaling 307.75 million US dollars (disclosed by the US State Department on the 27th of last month).

　　4. Secret "Defense Assistance" of 777,763,829 US dollars from the end of the Anti-Japanese War to June 30, 1947 (announced by the US State Department on the 28th of last month - Central News Agency Washington English telegram that day).

　　5. Gift of 271 naval vessels and the sale of surplus US military supplies in China, totaling approximately 800 million US dollars (estimated figures announced by the US State Department on the 25th of last month - Associated Press Washington dispatch that day).

　　6. Transfer of fixed US military equipment in China of 84 million US dollars (according to the US State Department "Bulletin" on May 8, 1947).

　　7. Surplus materials from the India-Burma battlefield of 500 million US dollars (according to the New York Times on September 27, 1945, the newspaper stated that it included 150 million US dollars of ammunition and 700 aircraft that had been delivered to the Chiang government).

　　8. 130 million rounds of ammunition on June 27, 1947, with a price reduction of 5,909,931 US dollars (original price of 6,566,589 US dollars, selling price of 656,658 US dollars).

　　9. The US portion of UNRRA relief supplies is 485 million US dollars (the total relief supplies are 675 million US dollars. US Department of Commerce data on February 1, 1947).

　　10. 5 million US dollars in post-UNRRA relief funds donated to the Chiang bandits (most of which are US donations).

　　The total of the above ten items is 4,496,629,823 US dollars.

(Note) 1. Truman stated in his China policy statement in December 1946 that the Pacific surplus materials were used to offset the wartime expenses of the US military in China, of which 20 million US dollars were transferred to the US-China Education Fund; 2. The assistance of the US military advisory group in training the Chiang army has not been calculated.

The total of the above two items of post-war loans and materials is 4,640,498,223 US dollars.

In Marshall's report to the US Congress on the 20th of last month, the figure of post-war aid to Chiang was listed as 1,409 million US dollars. This figure does not include the four items of surplus materials from India and Burma, surplus materials from the Pacific, 271 ships, and 5 million US dollars in post-UNRRA funds, as well as the two secret aids of air force assistance and defense assistance that the US State Department has only recently disclosed. The relief materials item only counts the US portion. In this way, the total is 1,413,109,931 US dollars, which is close to Marshall's figure.

According to the total of the above figures during and after the Anti-Japanese War, the total US aid to Chiang since the Anti-Japanese War is 6,208,298,223 US dollars.

Under its overall post-war expansion and aggression plan, the total amount of assistance provided by the US imperialists to reactionaries in various countries around the world, according to the US Department of Commerce on August 14, 1947, is about 20 billion US dollars (including loans, donations, private donations, US donations to the World Bank and the Monetary Fund, etc. According to the Associated Press Washington dispatch at that time, a large part of it (only the Monetary Fund, etc.) has not been used yet). Therefore, US imperialist aid to Chiang's civil war accounts for at least more than one-fifth of its total. For example, of the 2.7 billion US dollars that US imperialists aided foreign reactionaries in the name of UNRRA, the Chiang bandits received 485 million, accounting for more than one-sixth; of the total post-war lease-lend loans of 1.25 billion, the Chiang bandits accounted for 694 million, reaching more than half. It can be seen that US imperialism has used its greatest strength to support Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war. But the result is still only the complete bankruptcy of the American running dog Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary civil war plan, and it is making the Chiang family bandit gang increasingly approach its final death.

　　美帝援蒋初步统计
    美帝一九四八年援蒋方案提出之后，美国务院为了证明美国对于蒋介石反人民内战的“军事援助较一般所了解的多得多”（马歇尔语），又连续公布了两笔实行已久的对蒋家匪帮的秘密军事援助，即一九四六年六月二十七日美政府所批准的“八又三分之一队空军计划”，和对日战争结束后至四七年六月三十日秘密“防务援助”七亿七千七百六十三万余美元。这两笔秘密援助恰恰是马歇尔在华“调处”期中开始和继续进行的。马歇尔现在已经供认他在华的真正工作就是帮助蒋介石准备发动屠杀中国人民的大内战，他除接二连三地帮助了蒋介石大批军需武器之外，并“曾不断向中国（蒋匪）政府提供意见，如何改善其作战兵力”，这就彻底揭穿了他去年一月“离华声明”所谓“本人在华谈判以便促进中国和平与民主”的无耻谎言。
    自对日战争胜利以来，美帝为鼓励卖国贼蒋介石进行屠杀中国人民的内战，和将中国变成美国的殖民地，所给予蒋家匪帮的贷款及物资援助，据现有材料统计，已达四十六亿四千零四十九万八千二百二十三美元。抗战期中援助则为十五亿六千七百八十万美元，此项援助事实上绝大部分亦被蒋匪保留作抗战后发动内战的资本。两项合计则为六十二亿零八百二十九万八千二百二十三美元。详细项目如下：
    抗战中：
    （甲）贷款：
    一、一九三九年二月八日桐油贷款二千五百万美元。
    二、一九四○年三月七日滇锡贷款二千万美元。
    三、一九四○年九月二十五日钨砂贷款二千五百万美元。
    四、一九四○年十二月一日信用贷款五千万美元。
    五、一九四○年十二月一日平准基金贷款五千万美元。
    六、一九四二年二月七日财政贷款五亿美元。
    （以上六项系据一九四四年四月十五日美国务院“援华报告书”。）
    七、一九三九年三月信用贷款一千二百八十万美元。
    八、一九三九年三月飞机公司贷款一千五百万美元。（后两项系据一九四一年“财政评论”五卷四期贾士毅文，贾材料来源系国民党财政部。）
    以上八项贷款合计六亿九千七百八十万美元。其中一、二、三及七、八五项，据知至一九四七年底蒋匪政府已以中国战略物资锡锑钨等偿清。一九四○年之信用贷款五千万美元，据上月二十日蒋匪驻美大使馆宣布，亦已以上项战略物资偿清。
    （乙）物资：
    租界物资一项，计八亿七千万美元。（据一九四六年十二月杜鲁门对华政策声明）。
    此系一九四二年六月“中（蒋）美互助协定”所规定，原数为十五亿六千五百万美元，其中八亿七千万美元系抗战结束前商定，有一部分实际至抗战后始交蒋政府。而其余部分则完全系抗战后交蒋政府者，故应算入抗战后美援部分内。
    以上贷款及物资合计共为十五亿六千七百八十万美元。
    马歇尔二月二十日在美国会关于一九四八年援蒋方案报告中，将抗战中援蒋数字列为十四亿六千九百四十万美元，系不包括一九四七年底前已偿付之五项贷款九千七百八十万元在内。如把该部分除去，即为十四亿七千万元，与马歇尔数字大致相合。
    以上援蒋项目中：第一，抗战结束时及结束后交付之租借物资绝大部分系被留作抗战后内战中使用；第二，财政贷款五亿美元中，一亿五千五百万美元是抗战后动用的（据本年一月二十五日美联社引证美官方材料披露）；第三，财政贷款中已动用部分及平准基金贷款等系被当作外汇基金保留，抗战后继续使用。因此，抗战中美蒋贷款及物资，绝大部分皆成为蒋匪抗战后发动内战的资本。
    抗战结束后：
    （甲）贷款：
    一、历次棉花贷款共六千七百万美元。
    二、一九四六年五月改进海港贷款一千五百万美元（一九四六年十一月十二日柯克在青岛记者招待会上披露——美联社）。
    三、一九四七年四月船只贷款一千六百五十万美元（美航务委员会上月二十四日宣布）。
    四、一九四七年十月二十七日蒋美“救济协定”，规定给蒋救济贷款二千七百七十万美元。
    五、一九四七年十二月十九日美国会通过“临时援助”一千八百万美元。
    以上五项合计一亿四千四百二十万美元。
    （乙）物资：
    一、租借物资六亿九千四百万美元（据一九四七年二月一日美商务部“国外商务周刊”载，即一九四二年租借物资总额抗战中未商定部分）。
    二、一九四六年八月三十日让售太平洋剩余物资，成本八亿三千七百万美元（售价一亿七千五百万美元。同上美商务部数字）。
    三、一九四六年六月二十八日“八又三分之一队空军计划”飞机、装备成本及训练费用共计三亿零七百七十五万美元（美国务院上月二十七日宣露）。
    四、抗战结束至一九四七年六月三十日秘密“防务援助”七亿七千七百六十三万八千二百九十二美元（上月二十八日美国务院公布——当日中央社华盛顿英文电讯）。
    五、赠予海军舰只二百七十一艘，及美军在华剩余军火出售，合计价约八亿美元（上月二十五日美国务院公布之估计数字——美联社该日华府讯）。
    六、美军在华固定设备转让八千四百万美元（据一九四七年五月八日美国务院“公报”）。
    七、印缅战场剩余物资五亿美元（据一九四五年九月二十七日纽约时报载，该报称：当时包括一亿五千万美元的军火和七百架飞机已交蒋政府完讫）。
    八、一九四七年六月二十七日一亿三千万发子弹，减价五百九十万九千九百三十一美元（原价六、五六六、五八九美元，售价六五六、六五八美元）。
    九、联总救济物资美国部分四亿八千五百万美元（全部救济物资为六亿七千五百万美元。一九四七年二月一日美商务部数字）。
    十、联总结束后赠予蒋匪善后救济经费五百万美元（其中绝大部分为美国赠款）。
    以上十项合计四十四亿九千六百二十九万八千二百二十三美元。
    （附注）一、太平洋剩余物资，杜鲁门一九四六年十二月对华政策声明中，说明系用以抵偿战时美军在华费用债务者，其中且有二千万美元移作美国对华教育基金；二、美军顾问团训练蒋军援助尚未计算在内。
    以上战后贷款及物资两项合计，为四十六亿四千零四十九万八千二百二十三美元。
    马歇尔上月二十日在美国会报告中，将战后援蒋数字列为十四亿零九百万美元。该数字系未将印缅剩余物资、太平洋剩余物资、二七一艘舰只、联总赠予善后经费五百万美元四项及美国务院最近始宣露之空军援助及防务援助两项秘密援助包括在内，救济物资项则只算美国部分。如此，则合计为十四亿一千三百一十万九千九百三十一美元，与马歇尔数字接近。
    按以上抗战中及抗战结束后各项数字合计，则自抗战以来，美援蒋总数即为六十二亿零八百二十九万八千二百二十三美元。
    美帝在其战后扩张侵略总计划下，对世界各国反动派所作援助总额，据一九四七年八月十四日美商务部公布，共为二百亿美元左右（包括贷款、赠予、私人捐款、美捐助世界银行及货币基金等。据当时美联社华盛顿讯，且其中很大一部分（只货币基金等）尚未动用）。因此，美帝对蒋内战援助至少占其总数五分之一以上。例如美帝以联总名义援助外国反动派的二十七亿美元中，蒋匪即获得四亿八千五百万，占六分之一以上；战后租借物资贷款总数十二亿五千万中，蒋匪即占六亿九千四百万，达一半以上。可以看出，美帝国主义为了支持蒋介石的反人民内战，已使用了最大的力量。但其结果却仍然只是美国走狗蒋介石反革命内战计划的全部破产，并使蒋家匪帮日益接近最后死亡。
