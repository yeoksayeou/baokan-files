　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Manila dispatch: The influence of the Philippine People's Liberation Army and the Philippine National Peasants' Association is growing daily. According to the Philippine traitor Roxas at a press conference on the 6th, the "suppression" and "offensive" against the People's Liberation Army and the National Peasants' Association in the past have failed. He said: "From April 28, 1946, to January 23 this year, the Philippine people's armed forces fought against the government army in as many as 95 battles." But at the same time, the bandit Roxas announced with anger and shame that the People's Liberation Army, led by Philippine Communist leader Taruc, and the National Peasants' Association, led by Castillo, were "illegal organizations," and ordered the arrest of their leaders.

    【新华社陕北十四日电】马尼拉讯：菲人民解放军及菲全国农民协会的势力正日益增长，据菲奸罗哈斯六日在记者招待会上透露：过去对人民解放军及全国农协的“戡平”“攻势”，已告失败。他说：“自一九四六年四月二十八日至今年正月二十三日期间，菲人民武装抗击政府军的战事，共九十五次之多”。但罗匪同时却恼羞成怒地宣布：以菲共领袖塔拉克为首的人民解放军，及以加斯蒂洛为首的全国农协为“非法组织”，并下令逮捕其领袖。
