　　▲The Ping Bao reported on February 16th: Tian Zhenqing, a poor resident in Jinan City near Huangting Gate, is over sixty years old and makes a living by selling vegetables. His elderly wife and young children depend on him for survival. Recently, due to soaring prices, he is unable to continue his business. Driven by poverty, he painfully exchanged his ten-year-old only son for ten bags of flour. The old couple obtained the flour, but could not bear to part with their beloved son, and wept bitterly in the cold wind.
　　▲Zhang Chengren, a poor resident of Hefei, was forced to sell his son because he could not survive the Lunar New Year. He posted an advertisement next to the notice board of the Chiang bandit's "Wan Bao," which roughly stated: "Specially selling a young son, only accepting 6 million in Legal (Chiang) currency."
　　▲Yantai News: Commodity price increases in the city are shocking. Recently, Tianjin cabbage is selling for as much as 300,000 yuan per head, pork is 120,000 yuan per catty, and flour is 30-40,000 yuan per catty. It is estimated that less than one-thousandth of the citizens were able to eat white flour and meat during the Spring Festival.
　　▲Since a certain newspaper in Ping City published that Ji Fushan outside Chaoyangmen in Beiping specializes in selling human blood, poor college students, the unemployed, and the jobless have flocked to him to introduce them to selling blood in order to maintain their livelihood. However, there are very few buyers of blood, resulting in an oversupply of human blood.

    ▲二月十六日平报载：济南城内皇亭门口贫民田振清，年已六十余，卖菜为业，老妻弱子赖以为生，近以物价高涨，无力营业，为生活所迫，忍痛将其十龄独子换取面粉十袋，老夫妇易得面粉，难舍爱子，朔风中相对痛哭。
    ▲合肥贫民张承仁因无法度过旧历年关，被迫出卖儿子，在蒋匪“皖报”门旁贴报板上贴一广告，大意谓：“特将幼子出售，只收法（蒋）币六百万元”。
    ▲烟台讯：该市物价上涨惊人，近日天津白菜每棵已售至三十万元、猪肉每斤十二万元、面粉每斤三、四万元。据估计市民在春节时能吃白面和肉的不到千分之一。
    ▲平市自某报刊载北平朝阳门外有计福山者专以贩卖人血为生后，贫苦大中学生及失业、无业者，均纷纷去找他介绍卖血，以维生活。但买血者甚少，致人血亦供过于求。
