In order to effectively restore various tasks in the border region and better support the front lines, I hope that all assembly members and government members will examine and plan the government's various tasks with the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, so as to accelerate the arrival of victory."

Vice Chairman Yang then addressed the meeting amidst warm applause, saying: "I am deeply afraid of failing the people's expectations in being elected to government work. Fortunately, under the joint leadership and efforts of Chairman Mao, Chairman Lin, and all assembly members and government members, the border region has excellent achievements and a scale to follow. In the future, I will abide by the people's wishes and government resolutions and strive to restore the border region, support the front lines, and liberate the Great Northwest."
