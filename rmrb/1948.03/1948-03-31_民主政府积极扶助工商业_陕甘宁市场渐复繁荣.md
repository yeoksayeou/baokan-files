Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th: The industry and commerce in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia recovered areas, which had been severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandits, have gradually recovered with the active support of the democratic government and trade companies. In Washi, Zichang (Anding) County, a large number of merchants were captured by the Hu bandits, leaving only a few small vendors who had survived the disaster, and most of them were unable to open shops. The branch of the local trade company specifically transported a large amount of raw cotton and sold it to merchants at low prices for resale, allowing them to profit. Under the government's advocacy and encouragement, many merchants have adopted the method of forming partnerships and pooling shares to solve the difficulty of capital. Fifteen new shops have now been opened. The Border Region Industrial Cooperative Office has also established an iron factory in the county to manufacture plows and other agricultural implements for the needs of the masses in spring plowing. The local Production and Disaster Relief Committee, in coordination with the Zichang County United Cooperative, organized more than 20 blacksmith furnaces in Washi and other places to rush to produce old-style plows for supply to Yanchuan, Yan'an, Anse and other places. With the support of the government, more than a dozen industrial and commercial enterprises in Zhenchuan have opened one after another. Ye Shangrong, a landlord and businessman who fled to Yulin, returned to Zhenchuan to continue doing business after understanding our policies. In order to facilitate spring plowing, the No. 2 Township Farmers' Association organized six blacksmiths to repair agricultural implements for the masses. It also opened a farmers' hostel to use the profits to solve the problem of fodder for farmers' livestock. The Longdong Trade Company has set up retail outlets in six towns in Huachi, Quzi, and Huanxian, on the one hand, purchasing local products such as wool at high prices to increase farmers' income; on the other hand, transporting cloth, cotton, agricultural implements, etc. from other places and selling them to the masses at cost. The trade company also distributed cotton in various places to organize women to spin. There were originally eleven silk factories in Qingjian city. After the Hu bandits occupied it, sixteen of the original thirty-one silk weaving machines were destroyed, and a large number of merchants were kidnapped, causing most of the silk factories to stop work. Now, the county government, adhering to the principle of private operation with public assistance, has allocated grain as capital, and the trade company has loaned silk to silk shops that are unable to start work to weave, and has contracted weaving to weavers. The Wuqi (newly established) County Trade Company of the Sanbian Sub-district has issued a large number of interest-free loans to help poor people transport and sell salt and necessities. Mule and horse inns have been established in Wuqi and other places, and the transportation industry has become increasingly prosperous.
