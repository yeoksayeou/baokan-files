　　Important Correction
    In the article "Chiang Kai-shek's Treacherous Sale of China's New Twenty-One Demands" published in this newspaper on the 27th of last month, the last sentence should read: "And the Chinese people will certainly completely end imperialist aggression against China as a result." The original text omitted the word "against," which is hereby corrected.

　　重要更正
    上月二十七日本报所载“将介石盗卖中国的新二十一条”一文，最后一句应为“并且中国人民一定即将由此完全终结帝国主义对中国的侵略。”原文漏掉“对”字，特此补正。
