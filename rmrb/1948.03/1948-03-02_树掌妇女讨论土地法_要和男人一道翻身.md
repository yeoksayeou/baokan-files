　　Women in Shuzhang Discuss the Land Law
  　To Overturn Their Lives Alongside Men
    [Huguan News] After the women of Shuzhang in the sixth district of Huguan discussed the Outline Land Law and the news in the newspaper about "Mobilizing women to participate in equal distribution," everyone's awareness was raised through recounting their sufferings and comparing their skills with men. Poor woman Jing Ze said: "I came to Shuzhang at the age of twelve to serve the landlord. The landlords wore fur coats, and we wore rags. If we said we were cold, they would scold me: 'In your family, you might not even have a palm-sized piece of clothing to wear!' If my husband got angry, he would scold me and tell me to take the children and leave. The Land Law stipulates that we women also have a share. He can transport goods, and I can spin and weave. If he has two mu, I should also get two mu." Li Hezhi said: "I have lived under the eaves (meaning renting a house) for eighteen years without a single mu of farmland. Several children have been sold to make ends meet. In the past, I had to lower my head when walking on the street. People often said, 'Noodle soup is not a meal, and women can't sit at the table.' In the past, it was the world of the landlords. Now, with the implementation of the Land Law, everyone has clothes to wear, food to eat, land to cultivate, and a house to live in. We are so much better off now. Things belong to us, and we have more energy to work." Many women recounted the pain caused by the lack of freedom in marriage and said, "In the future, children must be allowed to choose their own marriages, so that the children will not suffer." Hou Qiaohai said: "Chairman Mao is calling on us to be treated as human beings. We must be treated as human beings. Men can join the army, and we can make military shoes. Men can transport goods, and we can deliver public grain. When the land is distributed, he (the man) gets a share, and we must also get a share." Liu Xueling said: "In the past, men had a share, and women had only a portion to eat. Daughters could only eat but not share. It's not that we women can't endure hardship. Last year, during the autumn plowing, the men plowed more than seven qing of land, and the women plowed eleven qing and five mu. Chairman Mao is calling on us, both men and women, to have a share of the land, and no one will look down on us." Hezhi added, "We can't delay this good opportunity to be treated as human beings. In the past, we lived under the dark rule of the landlords. Now the moon is shining. Chairman Mao knows the suffering of women, and everyone gets a share. Only with land can we have rights. We must actively participate in future movements." At this point in the discussion, everyone realized that it was not that they were born poor, nor was it that they had not married good men, but mainly that the old society was bad. We women not only had no say in politics, but also could not control economic matters. They were determined to participate in the replenishment movement in the future to completely overturn their lives.

　　树掌妇女讨论土地法
  　要和男人一道翻身
    【壶关消息】壶关六区树掌妇女，讨论了土地法大纲，和报上“发动妇女参加平分”的消息后，大家从诉苦和男人比本领中，提高了觉悟。贫妇景则说：“我十二岁上来到树掌，伺侯地主。东家们穿的是皮袄，咱穿的破衣服，说了个冷，人家就骂我：‘到你家还不定穿上个衣掌穿不上哩？’男人给我生了气就骂，叫我引上孩子走吧，土地法规定，咱妇女亦有份，他会运输，咱会纺织，他有二亩，咱亦得分上二亩”。李何支说：“我窜了十八年房檐（租房住的意思），没有一亩青田，好几个孩子都卖吃了，过去从街上走个路还得低下头，人常说‘面汤不是饭，妇女不能上桌面’。过去是人家地主的天下，现在实行土地法，人人有衣穿、有饭吃、有地种、有房住、咱可好了，东西成了自己的，动着也有劲。”有许多妇女诉说了因为婚姻不自由造成的痛苦后说：“今后的孩子们一定要人家自己主婚，可不要孩们也受罪。”侯俏孩说：“毛主席叫咱当人哩，一定要当人，男人能参战，咱能做军鞋，男人能运输，咱能推公粮。分土地时，他（男人）有一份，咱亦得有一份哩。”刘雪令说：“以前是男有分份女有吃份，闺女是光能吃不能分。咱妇女们又不是不能受，去年秋耕男人拉了七顷多地，妇女们就拉了十一顷零五亩。毛主席叫咱男女都有一份土地，谁亦就不下看了。”何支又说：“咱可不能耽搁了这个当人的好机会呀，以先咱过的是地主的黑天下，现在照出月亮了。毛主席知道妇女的痛苦，每人有一份，有地才能有权，以后运动时咱可要好好的参加哩。”讨论到这里，大家才认识过去不是命穷，也不是没有嫁上好汉子，主要是旧社会不好，咱们妇女不但在政治上没说话权，就在经济上亦主不了事，决心以后参加抽补运动，彻底翻身。
