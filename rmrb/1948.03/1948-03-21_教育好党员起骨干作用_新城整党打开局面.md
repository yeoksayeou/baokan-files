    Educating Party Members to Play a Backbone Role: Xincheng Rectification Opens Up the Situation
    [Shahe News] The Xincheng Village Party rectification in Shahe is being conducted in conjunction with the rectification of the masses' ranks. After the work team arrived, they immediately made scientific divisions of labor and conducted collective research to ensure that the work proceeded quickly and in a coordinated manner. When the work team first arrived, the branch party members were apprehensive. They understood that this time was not the same as in the past, so they had made preparations for a long time in advance. At the first branch meeting, several powerful party members said: "After I heard about the equal distribution of land, I prepared everything, and the poor peasant association was established long ago (fake), just waiting for you to come and do it ready-made." Most of the party members remained silent. Then they studied the "Letter to Party Members," and the leadership explained the spirit of this party rectification. Then they conducted self-criticism, in shifts, one by one, as if they had discussed it beforehand. When it was Comrade Shen ＠ni's (a female poor peasant) turn, she said unhappily due to everyone's urging: "I haven't been a team leader for a few days, and I don't have much to say. Why don't you (referring to bad party members) only talk about those obvious things? Why don't you talk about stealing and dividing fruit at Beixuetang...?" These words reminded us and discovered the power we could rely on within the party. We then went down to understand the situation from two aspects: (1) Investigate and interview among the masses. (2) Find six or seven honest party members (mostly new party members) within the branch who have no power, such as Shen ＠ni and Song Jinwen, and conduct individual conversations to understand the situation of the branch; at the same time, educate them to play a backbone role within the party.
    Based on understanding and research, the Xincheng branch has four characteristics: (1) The branch was developed during the three movements of anti-traitor liquidation, land reform, and review. (2) Most of the party members are good and from poor peasant backgrounds, but they do not hold power. The current branch committee's propaganda and cooperative manager have major problems. (3) Some party members were brought in through incorrect relationships when they joined the party, forming small cliques within the party by befriending, recognizing godchildren, and recognizing sworn sisters (historically, there were clan feuds between the north and south streets among the masses). (4) A few party members have a bad work style, collectively embezzling the fruits of struggle, and individually shielding landlords. Based on the above situation, the branch committee and old groups were all abolished and reorganized into three groups to conduct introspection. Then, the class components of the party members were re-classified according to new standards. The initial classification result was seventeen poor peasants (including three who did not labor or labored little), eight middle peasants, one upper-middle peasant, and three rich peasants (two women and one man), a total of twenty-nine. Later, the intra-party struggle turned to a few party members with major mistakes and bad backgrounds, and a more heated criticism was launched. Li ×× was the worst in the branch, killing one poor peasant and two middle peasants during the anti-traitor movement, engaging with six women, and never having worked. Last year, during the major grain transportation, the masses were very tired from carrying and shouldering, but he went to lead, riding a mule of the masses empty-handed. The masses were very dissatisfied with this matter, but dared not say anything.
    After a few days of party rectification and aligning teams, when the party members had some understanding in their thinking, the work team asked the party members for their opinions: "Should we invite the masses to participate in the branch meeting to help us?" The party members had two opinions: Most of the party members with minor mistakes said: "Let the farmers' association examine us quickly. Whoever the masses say is good can do it, and whoever they say is not good is dismissed." Li ××, who had made major mistakes, said: "Stop for a few days before participating, it's not good to be too fast." A female party member said: "It's not good to let the masses see this pile of bad things we've done." Afraid of losing face, they did not want the masses to participate. Good party members said: "You are so bad, but we are not. When can an ugly daughter-in-law not see her parents-in-law?" Finally, according to the opinion of the majority, it was decided to invite the masses to participate.
    A general meeting of the masses was convened. The work team first said to everyone: "Some of the masses have not completely turned over, and they have grievances. The main reason is that our Communist Party is not pure. This time, we must rely on everyone to transform our Communist Party members. You can study and research how to rectify...?" A heated discussion was launched at the whole meeting. Those who had not completely turned over said: "Call them (party members) to honestly talk about returning the excess fruits and stolen fruits." Some said: "Take out the fruit account and see how much we divided and how much they divided!" Some who had been hit by cadres said: "Call those people out tonight." They were very hateful of bad party members. After a long period of brewing, a correct decision was finally made: Poor peasants Liu Zhufu and Yao Shijie said: "My opinion is to have a few of us listen to how they conduct self-criticism in the meeting, and we can also offer some opinions. Cadres should not be treated like landlords in the struggle. It is not good to break them down." With the addition of leadership guidance, everyone agreed with this opinion. Representatives were immediately elected to attend the branch meeting. Han Maodeng said: "Find good people who work well and often go to the fields to collect firewood and pick vegetables." Some said: "If you choose someone with bigger mistakes than the cadres, people won't be convinced. You have to find good people who can represent our opinions." Finally, two conditions were decided: 1. Be upright and work hard all year round. 2. Do not retaliate and be able to do things for everyone. As a result of the election, eight men and two women went to the branch to listen to the party members' self-criticism. (Work Team, Joint Office)

    教育好党员起骨干作用　新城整党打开局面
    【沙河消息】沙河新城村整党与整顿群众的队伍是结合进行的。工作组到后即科学分工，集体研究，使工作步调一致且进行得快。工作组刚到时，支部党员恐慌，他们了解这次不和过去一样，所以在事前他们也做了很久的准备工作。第一次支部会上，几个有权的党员这样说：“俺听到平分土地后，啥也预备好了，贫农团早成立起来（假的），光等你们来，现成干了。”大多数党员不吭气。接着就学习告党员书，领导上说明这次整党的精神。然后检讨，轮班式的，一个个说了一遍，看着就象事先商量了一样。轮到申＠妮（女贫农）同志时，由于大家的督促，她很不高兴的说：“我当上组长没几天，也没啥说，你们（指坏党员）光说那几件明事，在北学堂偷分果实为啥不谈……。”这几句话，提醒了我们，发现了在党内所依靠的力量。下去便从两方面了解：（一）在群众中调查、访问。（二）找着了申＠妮、宋金文等六、七个在支部内没权的老实党员（新党员多），分头进行个别谈话，了解支部的情况；同时也教育他们在党内起骨干作用。
    根据了解研究，新城支部有四个特点：（一）支部是在反奸清算、土改、复查三次运动中发展起来的。（二）党员多数是好的，是贫雇出身，但不掌权，现在的支委宣传、合作经理毛病很大。（三）一部分党员入党时，是以不正确关系拉进的，在支部内拜朋友、认干儿、拜干姊妹，以此拉拢，形成党内的小集团（群众中历史上南北街闹宗派）。（四）少数党员作风恶劣，集体贪污斗争果实，个别包庇地主。依据以上情况，将支委、旧有的小组，一律取消，重新编成三个组，进行反省。随着就用新的标准划了下党员阶级成份，初步划的结果是贫农十七个（内有三个没劳动或少劳动过），中农八个，上中农一个，富农三个（二女一男），共廿九个。后来党内斗争便转上几个错误大的和出身不好的党员身上，开展了较热烈的批评。支部内李××最坏，在反奸中杀贫雇一人，中农二人，搞女人六个，没有劳动过。去年大运粮时，群众们驮、担很辛苦，他去领导，空着手骑了群众一头骡子。群众对这事十分不满，但不敢吭。
    经几天的整党站队后，在党员思想上已有了一些认识时，工作组征求党员意见说：“是否该叫群众参加支部会，帮助我们呢？”党员有两种意见：大部错误不大的党员说：“快叫农会审查咱吧，群众说谁好，谁就干，看谁不好，谁就散（算）。”错大的李××说：“停几天再参加吧，太快了也不好。”一个女党员说：“叫群众来看看咱这一堆坏事，可不好。”怕丢人，不愿叫群众参加。好党员们说：“你是那样坏吧，俺们可不是，到啥时丑媳妇还能不见婆婆？”最后根据多数人的意见，决定请群众参加。
    群众召开了全体大会，工作员先给大家说：“群众们有的没翻透身，有苦水，主要是我们共产党内不纯，这次要依靠大家把我们共产党员改造的，你们可以研究，研究怎整………？”全会场便开展了热烈的讨论，没翻透身的说：“叫他们（党员）来好好的把多分果实、偷分果实说说退出来。”又有的说：“把果实帐拿出来，看看咱分了多少，他们分了多少！”有些受过干部打击的说：“今黑夜就把那些人叫出来。”对坏党员非常仇恨。经过长时间的酝酿，终于有了个正确决定：贫雇刘柱福，姚石介二人说：“我的意见是叫咱们几个人去听听他们开会怎的反省哩，咱也提个意见，对干部不能给斗地主一样，斗崩了也不好。”再加上领导上的诱导，都同意这个意见。当场便选参加支部会代表，韩毛登说：“找劳动好，常上地打柴、拾菜这号好人选。”有的说：“选个比干部错还大的去，人家可不服气，得找好人，能代表咱的意见才行。”最后决定两个条件：一、为人正派，长年劳动。二、不报复能为大家办事的。选举结果，男人八个，女人二个，到支部去听党员反省。（工作组、联合办公室）
