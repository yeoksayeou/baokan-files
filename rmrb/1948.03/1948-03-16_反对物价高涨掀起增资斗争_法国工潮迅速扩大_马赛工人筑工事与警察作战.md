Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 14th: Comprehensive reports: The struggle of French workers against soaring prices is spreading and expanding. The strike struggle of tens of thousands of miners in the northern mining cities of Liévin, Bruay, and Douai has persisted for several days. More than 18,000 miners in Douai went on strike on the 12th. The Marseilles dockworkers' general strike, which began on February 23, was joined by more than 1,000 sugar workers in Marseilles on February 26. Strikers built fortifications at the entrance of the sugar refinery and fought with the police. Their courage and anger were similar to the scenes of the general strike last November. Subsequently, workers in the Seine Province, steel workers in the central department of Puy-de-Dôme, and railway workers in French Morocco also began pay raise struggles earlier this month. The strikers in Puy-de-Dôme demanded a 20% pay increase and the removal of spies and troublemakers from the factory. More than 6,000 railway workers in Morocco, despite the Governor-General's adoption of collective requisition measures, united and persisted in their struggle for several days, bringing traffic to a standstill. Electricity, transportation, and dock workers in Rabat (one of Morocco's ports) launched partial warning strikes on the 8th, forcing the French Governor-General and employers to negotiate with the unions. The pay raise struggle of workers in Casablanca is also underway simultaneously.

  　法国工潮迅速扩大
    马赛工人筑工事与警察作战
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：法国工人反对物价飞涨的斗争，正在蔓延与扩大。北部矿区城市里文、布鲁埃及杜埃数万矿工的罢工斗争，已坚持数日。杜埃矿工一万八千余人已于十二日实行罢工。二月二十三日开始的马赛码头工人大罢工，于二月二十六日获得马赛糖业工人一千余人的响应，罢工者在炼糖厂进口处修筑防御工事，与警察作战，其勇敢与愤激情绪与去年十一月大罢工时的情景类似。接着，赛纳省的工人，中部多姆省钢铁工人及法属摩洛哥的铁路工人，亦于本月初先后开始了增资斗争。多姆省的罢工者提出增资百分之二十及撤换工厂内特务和挑拨者职位的要求。摩洛哥六千余铁路工人不顾总督采取集体征用办法曾团结一致坚持斗争数天，使交通陷于停顿，拉巴特（摩洛哥港口之一）的电力、交通和码头工人，则于八日起举行了部分警告罢工，迫使法国总督及资方与工会进行谈判。卡萨布兰卡工人的增资斗争亦同时进行中。
