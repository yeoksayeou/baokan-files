　　Unprincipled Fault-Finding and Purges Isolate the Poor and Hired Peasants
  　Shi Village Work Team Should Examine Closed-Doorism
    [Yongnian News] The Poor Peasants' League of Shizhuang Village, Yongnian Fourth District, was organized by the village's resident organs in coordination with the village's poor and hired peasant activists, through visiting poor and hired peasants, voicing grievances, and class division, before the work team arrived. After its establishment, it underwent review and purging, but the internal organization was still not pure enough. After the work team arrived, on March 22nd, another group was purged. The conditions for purging proposed by the work team were: anyone who had served as a puppet soldier or been a member of a puppet organization for even one day, or who had secretly sold opium flour, or was sexually promiscuous, or had worked as a runner for the puppet village office, etc., should be excluded. According to Shizhuang Village's more than 200 poor and hired peasant households, more than 60 households had served as puppet soldiers, accounting for more than a quarter; sexual promiscuity was a common phenomenon; because it was close to the Linluoguan Railway Station, many had sold opium flour... Especially those who had served as puppet soldiers or been members of puppet organizations had been reviewed and purged many times when the Poor Peasants' League was first organized, and only a portion had participated; this time, all were purged. Originally, many of the poor and hired peasants had the above-mentioned faults, so after these conditions were publicized at the general meeting of the Poor Peasants' League, led by a few individuals, they began to pick on each other's faults. You said he had served as a puppet soldier, he said you had visited someone's house... forming a state of mutual "biting" and mutual "suppression" of grievances. As a result, very few were completely without faults. After announcing the conditions, the work team generally stated: these bad people (referring to those who should be purged according to the announced conditions) in the Poor Peasants' League prevent the poor from improving their situation, etc. After the meeting, many people were panicked, discouraged, and pessimistic. At the Poor Peasants' League meeting on the evening of the 22nd, very few people attended. Guo San Chou said: "I put down my peddler's burden and attend meetings every day, but it's all in vain!" Among those expelled, such as Ma Yingzi, had been poor for generations. His grandfather had starved to death, his father pushed a cart and begged for a living, and he himself had swept horse manure, begged for food, and worked as a cotton gin worker. Just because he had worked as a cook in the puppet army for a few months, he was expelled. He said: "I was forced by the landlords and traitors to have no way to go, so I went to be a puppet soldier for a few days. I didn't secretly sell opium flour, didn't visit other's wives, and didn't extort anyone... After joining the Poor Peasants' League, I often stayed up half the night for meetings and investigating landlords, but I never thought I would become a bad person!..." Saying this, he cried. Since being expelled, he had been restless, had no heart to work, and cried injustice everywhere. Those who remained in the Poor Peasants' League were also dissatisfied, such as the old hired peasant Dan ××, who said: "Good people have also been picked out, the Poor Peasants' League is isolated..." Dan Mazi said: "This is really a joke for the landlords and bad village cadres!" Ma Luzi said: "Not all those who were puppet soldiers can be considered bad people. Some were captured, some were forced, some were starving at home and went to get food, and they didn't do bad things. How can this be considered bad people?!..." Ma Youzi said: "Some people who are clearly good people have also been purged, we really don't know what's going on!" What kind of poor and hired peasants can join the Poor Peasants' League?

　　无原则挑剔清洗使贫雇陷于孤立
  　施庄工作组应检查关门主义
    【永年消息】永年四区施庄村的贫农团是工作组没下去前，由驻村机关协同村中贫雇积极分子，经过访贫雇、诉苦、划阶级组织起来的。成立后又经过审查、清洗，内部仍然不够纯。工作组下来后，于三月廿二日，又清洗了一批。工作组提出的清洗条件是：当过一天伪军或伪属的，或抽卖过白面的，男女性乱的，当过伪村公所跑腿的等都不要。按施庄村二百余户贫雇中，当过伪军的有六十多户，约占四分之一强；男女性乱的是普遍现象；因靠近临洛关车站，卖过白面的也很多……。特别是当过伪军或伪属的，开始组织贫农团时，曾经过多次审查、清洗，只参加了一部分，这次全部清洗下来。本来贫雇中，上述毛病很多人都有的，所以在贫农团全体大会上，把这些条件宣传后，会场中在个别人带头下，就互相挑起毛病，你说他当过伪军，他说你串过门子……，形成了“互相咬”互相“蹩气”的对立状态。结果，根本没毛病的极少。工作组在宣布条件后，又一般的提出说：这些坏人（指按宣布条件应清洗的）在贫农团，穷人翻不好身之类的话。会后不少人恐慌、泄气、悲观。二十二日晚的贫农团大会、人到的很少，郭三丑说：“俺把货郎担子放下，天天开会，开到现在白搭！”在开除的人里，如马营子几辈穷。祖父已饿死，父亲推小车、讨饭，过了一辈子，他自己曾扫马粪，讨饭，当轧花工人。就因为在伪军里当了几个月伙夫，被开除了。他说：“俺被地主汉奸逼的没路可走了，才去当了几天伪军，不抽料面，不串门子，也没讹诈过人……。参加贫农团后，为着开会、查地主，常大半夜不睡觉，想不到这会也成了坏人！……”说着哭起来。他自从被开除后，坐卧不安，活也没心做，到处喊冤、叫屈。留在贫农团的人也不满，如老雇工单××说：“把好人也挑出去了，贫农团孤单了……”单麻子说：“真叫地主坏村干看笑话咧！”马禄子说：“当伪军的不能都算坏人，有被抓去的，有被逼去的，有在家饿慌的去混饭的，又没作坏事，这能算坏人？！………”马有子说：“有些明明是好人，也清出了，咱真不知道怎回事！”究竟什么样的贫雇才能进贫农团呢？（梅村）
