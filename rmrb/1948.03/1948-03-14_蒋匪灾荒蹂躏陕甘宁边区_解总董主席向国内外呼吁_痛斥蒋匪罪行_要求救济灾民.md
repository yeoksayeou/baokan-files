Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th—The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region suffered from the ravages of Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops last year, and was also hit by famine, resulting in wasteland, people without clothing or food, and the spread of epidemics. Comrade Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Relief General Association of the Liberated Areas, has appealed to all righteous people in China and the world, denouncing the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and demanding relief for 1.5 million affected compatriots. The original telegram is as follows:

For more than ten years, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has implemented democratic construction, encouraged mass production, and seen its economy and culture flourish, with the people enjoying a democratic, free, and happy life. Unfortunately, last year it was ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops and suffered from famine, resulting in the worst disaster in more than a decade. According to a report from the Border Region government, more than nine-tenths of the region and 1.5 million people have been brutally looted by Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, turning the construction of the past ten years into ashes. Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops have attempted to permanently occupy our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, implement immigration and village consolidation, creating vast uninhabited zones. For example, the Gaoqiaochuan area of Ansai and the Zhangcunyizhan area of ＠ county, dozens of miles around, are now deserted. In areas where bandit troops were stationed for a long time, doors, windows, and wood were all burned, fruit trees were cut down, courtyards were overgrown with weeds, and almost all farmland was abandoned; planted land was used by bandit troops to feed livestock. There are about 37 areas with such heavy losses, affecting 400,000 disaster victims. Even in areas with relatively light losses, according to a survey of 4,300 villages, the loss of cattle was 8%, donkeys 30%, mules and horses 33%, sheep 20%, and pigs 24%. The average loss of grain per person was 2.8 *shi* (斗, a Chinese unit of dry measure), and the estimated total loss in the border region was 380,000 *shi* of grain, more than 22,000 cattle, more than 40,000 donkeys, and more than 100,000 pieces of farm equipment. Other losses, such as furniture and clothing, are too numerous to calculate. Last year, the border region also suffered from spring drought, autumn flooding, and frost, which were exacerbated by the disasters caused by Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, making it the worst in more than a decade. According to reports from various places, the cultivated area in the border region decreased by about 3.5 million *mu* (亩, a Chinese unit of area), and the harvest was less than half of the previous year. The three sub-regions of Yan'an, Suide, and Sanbian, with a population of 1.25 million, had a total of only 800,000 *shi* of grain from last year's summer and autumn harvests, plus past reserves, resulting in an exceptionally severe famine this year. In the four most severely affected areas, there are 230,000 disaster victims, two-thirds of whom had already run out of food by the end of the lunar year. Currently, the disaster victims mainly rely on corn cobs, buckwheat leaves, bran, and wild vegetables to survive, and are painfully killing their infants due to hunger. In Yanchuan, where the textile industry is developed, some people still wear ragged single pants in winter, exposing their flesh. Doors and windows are damaged and cannot be rebuilt, and are blocked with straw mats and dead cowhides. The famine is accompanied by the spread of epidemics. According to surveys, the number of deaths in the Yuju district of Yanchuan accounts for 8.6% of the total population, and eight or nine out of ten babies born this year in Panlong and Yongping will not survive. The democratic government of the border region is now doing its best to help people produce and provide disaster relief, and all government agencies and civil servants are also launching a savings and relief campaign. However, with such a severe famine, it is clear that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's own efforts alone cannot quickly alleviate the suffering of the disaster victims. Therefore, in addition to calling on the people of all liberated areas to practice thrift and actively help, we also appeal to all righteous people in China and the world, hoping that people from all walks of life can give sympathetic assistance to our 1.5 million affected compatriots in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and use the power of public opinion to condemn the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, as well as the American reactionaries who encourage Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops to persist in the civil war and slaughter the Chinese people with money, materials, and even weapons and ammunition. We believe that righteous people in China and the world will give just assistance to these affected compatriots.
    Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association.

　　蒋匪灾荒蹂躏陕甘宁边区
  　解总董主席向国内外呼吁           
    痛斥蒋匪罪行·要求救济灾民
    【新华社陕北十二日电】陕甘宁边区去年因受蒋胡匪军蹂躏，又遭灾荒，以致田地荒芜，人民无衣无食，疫疠流行，解放区救济总会主席董必武同志为此特向全中国全世界正义人士呼吁，痛斥蒋匪罪行，要求救济一百五十万被难同胞。兹将原电照录如下：
    陕甘宁边区十余年来在共产党领导下实行民主建设，奖励群众生产，经济文化蒸蒸日上，人民得享民主自由幸福生活。不幸去年受蒋胡匪军蹂躏，又遭灾荒，酿成十余年来未有之大灾。近得边区政府报告，据称：边区十分之九以上地区和一百五十万人民，惨遭蒋胡匪军之洗劫，过去十余年之建设，化为灰烬。蒋胡匪军妄图永占我陕甘宁边区，实行移民并村，造成广大的无人区。如安塞高桥川，及＠县张村驿，方圆数十里，现均荒芜人烟，在匪军久驻地区，门窗木料全被烧光，果树被砍光，院中长满蒿草，田地几乎全部荒芜，种上的地也被匪军喂了牲口。象这样损失惨重的地区，约有三十七个区，灾民达四十万人。即在损失比较轻的地区，根据四千三百个村庄的调查，牛损失百分之八，驴损失百分之三十，骡马损失百分之三十三，羊损失百分之二十，猪损失百分之二十四，平均每人损失粮食二·八市斗，全边区估计约损失粮食三十八万市石，牛二万二千余头，驴四万余头，农具十万余件，其他如家具衣服等类损失，多至无法计算。去年边区又遭春旱秋涝霜冻，这些灾害因蒋胡匪军灾祸而更严重，为十余年来所未有。据各地报告，去年边区耕地面积减少约三百五十万亩，收成不及前年一半。延属绥属三边三个分区，人口一百二十五万人，去年夏收秋收再加过去存粮，总共不过八十万市石，以致造成今年异常严重的灾荒。在灾情最严重的四个地区，计有二十三万灾民，其中三分之二旧历年底即已断粮，现在灾民主要依靠玉蜀黍心、荞麦叶、谷糠、野菜度日，因饥饿而忍痛弄死婴儿。在纺织发达的延川，冬天还有人穿着破烂的露出肉身的单裤，门窗破坏无法重建，用席片死牛皮来堵塞。伴随着灾荒而来的瘟疫流行。据调查延川禹居区死亡人数占人口总数的百分之八·六，蟠龙永坪一带今年养下的娃娃十有八九不活。现在边区民主政府正以全力帮助人民生产救灾，全体政府机关公务人员，也正发起节约救灾运动。但这样严重的灾荒，单靠陕甘宁边区自己的力量，显然不能迅速脱灾民于苦难的。所以我们除号召各解放区人民节衣缩食踊跃帮助外，更向全中国全世界呼吁，希望各界正义人士能给我们陕甘宁边区一百五十万被难同胞以同情的援助，并以舆论的力量斥责蒋胡匪军的罪行，及斥责以金钱物资以至武器弹药鼓励蒋胡匪军坚持内战屠杀中国人民的美国反动派。我们相信全中国全世界的正义人士对这些被难同胞是会给以正义的援助的。中国解放区救济总会主席董必武。
