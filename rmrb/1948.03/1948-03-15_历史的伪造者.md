The Soviet Information Bureau published an important document entitled "Forgers of History" from February 9th to 16th. It consists of four parts excluding the preface. Here is a summary broadcast by Xinhua News Agency.

　　　　First Part: How Did the Preparation for German Aggression Begin?

The United States and its British and French partners are trying to convince people that the preparation for German aggression only began in the autumn of 1939. But who doesn't know that Hitler started preparing for war as soon as he came to power? Who doesn't know that the Hitler regime was established with the full support of German monopoly oligarchs and the ruling groups of Britain, France, and the United States?

To prepare for war, Hitler had to equip Germany with the most modern armaments and first restore and develop its heavy industry, especially the metallurgical and armaments industries in the Ruhr. However, due to its defeat in the First Imperialist War and the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany could not complete this task on its own in the short term.

In this regard, the United States gave Germany a great deal of financial assistance. After the Treaty of Versailles, American banks and trusts, with the full support of their government, invested heavily in Germany, providing credit loans amounting to billions of US dollars.

The United States and Britain used the so-called Dawes Plan to make German industry dependent on American and British monopoly capital. As a result, American and British capital poured into and infiltrated German industry in large quantities. As a result of the re-equipment of production machinery, the German economy began to rise rapidly from 1925 and reached the 1913 level by 1927. In terms of manufactured goods, it exceeded the 1913 level by 12 percent.

Between 1924 and 1929, foreign capital poured into Germany, with long-term investments exceeding 10 to 15 billion marks and short-term investments exceeding 6 billion marks. According to some materials, the total amount of investment far exceeded the above figures. This led to a huge increase in the German economy, especially its war potential, and the US investment, which accounted for more than 70 percent of all long-term loans, played a particularly important role.

The major American monopoly enterprises and the German industrial *Kangling* were inextricably linked. American DuPont de Nemours *Kangling* and British Imperial Chemical Trust (Imperial Chemical Company, one of the largest shareholders of General Motors Trust) maintained close industrial relations with German Chemical *Kangling* (Farben Industries), and signed a cartel agreement on the world gunpowder market with the latter in 1926.

Before the war, the chairman of Rome Haas Company of Philadelphia and the head of Darmstadt Company of Germany were good buddies. Coincidentally, Rudolf Müller, a director of the latter company, is now a popular figure in the Allied occupation zones and plays an important role in the Christian Democratic Party leadership. After the Munich Conference in 1938, Mobil Oil Trust and Farben Industries signed a contract agreeing that the former would give the latter a share of the production profit of aviation gasoline, and the latter would stop exporting synthetic gasoline as a reward. Synthetic gasoline was precisely what Germany was striving to accumulate in preparation for the war.

This intricate relationship was not unique to American monopoly capital. The Federation of British Industries and the Reich Group of German Industries had close relations not only of commercial importance but also of military importance. These relations continued until the eve of the war. In 1939, representatives of British and German monopoly enterprises issued a joint statement in Düsseldorf, stating: "Will seek full cooperation between the industrial systems of (European) countries." This was already after Hitler annexed Czechoslovakia. No wonder the London "Economist" magazine wrote about this: "Isn't there something in the air in Düsseldorf that has made these wise men lose their senses?"

As everyone knows, Schröder Bank, established by Thyssen and other Ruhr industrial zone leaders, has branches in New York and London, which provides a typical example of various collusions between American-German and British-German capital.

Allen Dulles, director of New York Schröder Bank, representing the interests of Schröder enterprises in London, Cologne, Hamburg and other places, is the tycoon of the bank. And his brother, John Foster Dulles, now an advisor to Mr. Marshall, is the head of the well-known Sullivan-Clawfield law firm in New York. This law firm has an inextricable connection with the Rockefeller-Morgan Mobil Oil Trust and Chase Bank. Chase Bank is the most powerful bank in the United States and has huge investments in German industry and holds an important position in the New York branch of Schröder Bank.

It must not be forgotten that it was the nectar of dollars that nurtured Hitler's German heavy industry, especially the war industry, and put the weapons of aggression into Hitler's hands.

However, this is not the whole story. Another factor of decisive importance in helping Hitler launch his aggression was the British and French ruling groups' policy of "appeasement" towards Hitler's Germany and abandonment of the policy of collective security.

Soon after Hitler came to power in 1933, the governments of Britain, Germany, France, and Italy signed the "Four-Power Pact of Amity and Cooperation" in Rome. At that time, Germany and Italy did not conceal their aggressive intentions. This treaty meant that Britain and France had abandoned the policy of strengthening the unified front of peace-loving countries against aggression from the very beginning.

In 1934, Britain and France helped Hitler take advantage of Poland's hostility towards the Soviet Union and signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, which was an important stage in Germany's preparation for aggression. Hitler's purpose was to show that Europe did not need collective security, but separate agreements. In this way, Germany could decide as it pleased: which countries to conclude treaties with? When to conclude treaties? Which countries to attack? When to attack? There is no doubt that the German-Polish Treaty was the first destructive collapse of the collective security edifice. Hitler became bolder and more unscrupulous in taking a series of steps to rebuild Germany's armed forces. These steps were not opposed in any way by the British and French rulers. On the contrary, in 1935, Britain and Germany signed a naval agreement in London, and Britain agreed that Germany would build a naval force almost equal to that of France. With the connivance of the United States, Britain, and France, the appetite of the fascist aggressors became larger and larger. At that time, Germany and Italy were able to carry out armed attacks on Abyssinia and Spain without difficulty.

Only the Soviet Union consistently and resolutely adhered to its peaceful policy, acted righteously, and fought to safeguard the equality and independence of Abyssinia and the rights of the legitimate Spanish Republican government. On January 10, 1936, Molotov stated at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "The Soviet Union has used its status as a member of the League of Nations to implement its policy against imperialist aggression." And pointed out: "The threat of world war is growing and gradually spreading to Europe."

As early as February 16, 1936, at the Disarmament Conference, the Soviet Union suggested giving "aggression and aggressors" as precise a definition as possible, in order to "eliminate all excuses for defense" and to facilitate collective security and the maximum reduction of armaments. However, this suggestion was rejected by the Disarmament Conference, which followed British and French instructions and acted in the interests of German aggression. The Soviet delegation to the League of Nations, headed by Litvinov, fought tirelessly for collective security. On August 30, 1936, the Soviet delegation submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations a proposal to ask the League of Nations to discuss concrete steps for collective security. As everyone knows, this proposal has been buried in the archives of the League of Nations by Britain and France, which adopted a policy of "appeasement" towards Germany. They hoped that by satisfying Hitler's aggressive desires with concessions in the West, they could turn the spearhead of this aggression to the East as an anti-Soviet weapon.

In order to deceive readers and slander the Soviet Union, American journalist Stanford claimed that the Soviet Union opposed collective security, and that Litvinov's departure from his post and Molotov's succession as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs was proof of this change. What could be more foolish than this statement? Obviously, Litvinov was not pursuing his own policy, but the policy of the Soviet government. Molotov's transfer was only because Germany was eager to try and actively preparing for war at that time, and the United States, Britain, and France were conspiring to turn this war against the Soviet Union. At such a juncture, it was necessary to have someone more experienced and more popular than Litvinov to serve as the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs.

It was at this time that two lines on world affairs had already developed. One was for peace, for forming collective security, and for resisting aggression through the joint efforts of all peace-loving countries. This was the line that the Soviet Union consistently and unswervingly pursued. The other was to refuse to form collective security and to refuse to oppose aggression, thereby inevitably encouraging German and Italian fascism to accelerate their aggressive activities and helping to launch a new war. If the United States had not financed Hitler's German heavy industry, and Britain and France had not rejected collective security, but had jointly organized collective resistance to Germany with the Soviet Union, then Hitler's aggressive weapons would have felt insufficient, Hitler's annexation policy would have been frustrated by the collective security system, and Hitler's hope of successfully launching the Second World War would have been reduced to a minimum. If, under such unfavorable conditions, the Hitlerites had dared to risk launching the Second World War, they would have been defeated in the first year of the war. Unfortunately, due to the bankrupt policies pursued by the United States, Britain, and France throughout the pre-war period, this situation did not occur. The criminals who allowed Hitler to successfully launch the Second World War, which lasted for almost six years and deprived humanity of millions of lives, were the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France.

　　历史的伪造者
    苏联情报局
    苏联情报局于二月九日至十六日公布之“历史的伪造者”重要文件，除序言外，共分四部分，兹摘要播发。　　　　　　　——新华社    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    　　　　第一部分：德国侵略的准备是怎样开始的？
    美国及其英法伙伴，力图使人相信德国侵略的准备，是在一九三九年秋季才开始的，但是谁不知道希特勒刚一上台，就进行战争准备的呢？谁不知道希特勒政权是德国独占寡头在英、法、美统治集团的完全赞助下建立起来的呢？
    希特勒为准备战争，必须使德国有最现代化的军备，必须先恢复与发展其重工业，首先是鲁尔的冶金与军火工业。但是由于在第一次帝国主义大战中的败北，与凡尔赛和约的束缚，使德国不可能在短期内以自身的力量完成这一工作。
    在这方面，美国给了德国以大力资助，在凡尔赛和约以后，美国银行与托辣斯在该国政府充分赞助之下，大量向德国投资，予以信用贷款，数达数十亿美元之巨。
    美国与英国利用了所谓道威斯计划，使德国工业依附于美英独占资本。美英资本因此而得大量倾注与渗入德国工业，结果由于生产机器的重新装备，德国经济自一九二五年起即开始迅速上升，至一九二七年止，已达一九一三年水平，就制成品言，超过了一九一三年水平百分之十二。
    一九二四至一九二九年间，涌入德国的外国资本中，长期投资在一百至一百五十亿马克以上，短期投资在六十亿马克以上，据若干材料，投资总额还远超过上述数字。这引起了德国经济，特别是战争潜力的巨大增长，而占全部长期贷款百分之七十以上的美国投资，作用尤为重要。
    美国各主要独占企业和德国工业康＠仑是血肉相联，难分难解的。美国杜邦·德纳穆康来仑和英国帝国化学托辣斯（帝国化学公司，为通用汽车托辣斯最大股东之一），与德国化学康＠仑（法尔本企业公司）之间，保持着密切的工业关系，并在一九二六年与后者订立了世界火药市场的卡迭尔协定。
    战前，美国费城罗姆·拉斯公司董事长，和德国达姆斯塔特公司首脑，是一对好伙计。凑巧的是后一公司的董事鲁道尔夫·缪勒，现在又是联合占领区的红人，并在基督教民主党领袖中起着重要作用。一九三八年慕尼黑会议以后，美孚油托辣斯和法尔本企业公司订立了一项合同，议定：前者分给后者航空汽油的一份生产利润，后者以停止人造汽油之输出作为报酬，而人造汽油正是德国为了准备战争需要而努力积蓄的东西。
    这种千丝万缕的瓜葛，并不是美国独占资本独有的典型。英国工业联合会和德国帝国工业集团，不仅有着商业重要性的，而且有着军事重要性的密切关系。这些关系一直保持到战争前夕。一九三九年，英德独占企业的代表曾在杜塞尔多夫发表联合声明，略称：“将寻求（欧洲）各国工业体系间的充分合作，”这已经是希特勒并吞捷克以后的事了。无怪乎伦敦“经济学家”杂志关于这件事曾写道：“岂不是杜塞尔多夫的空气中有什么东西使这些明智之士失掉了知觉吗？”
    众所周知，由蒂森及其他鲁尔工业区头子设立的舒鲁德银行，在纽约与伦敦均设有分行，这提供了美德及英德资本间种种勾结的一个典型例证。
    代表伦敦、科隆、汉堡等地舒鲁德企业公司利益的纽约舒鲁德银行董事亚伦·杜勒斯，是该行的大亨。而他的兄弟，马歇尔先生现在的顾问约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯，则是纽约有名的苏利文——克拉非尔法律事务所的首脑，这一法律事务所与洛克菲勒——摩根的美孚油托辣斯和大通银行，有着难分难解的勾结，而大通银行止是美国最有势力的银行，并且在德国工业中有巨额投资，也在纽约舒鲁德银行分行中据有重要地位。
    一定不要忘记，正是美元的甘霖，培育了希特勒德国的重工业，特别是战争工业，把侵略的武器交入希特勒之手。
    然而，这并不是事情的全部，另一个对帮助希特勒发动侵略具有决定性重要意义的因素，便是英法统治集团的“绥靖”希特勒德国的政策，抛弃集体安全的政策。
    一九三三年希特勒刚上台不久，英、德、法、意四国政府在罗马签订了“四强亲睦合作条约”，当时德意二国是并不隐讳其侵略意图的。这一条约意味着英法已自始即放弃了加强爱好和平国家反侵略统一战线的政策。
    一九三四年，英法又帮助希特勒利用波兰对苏联的敌视态度，订立了德波互不侵犯条约，这是德国侵略准备中的一个重要阶段。希特勒的目的是想借此表示：欧洲所需要的不是集体安全，而是分别协议。这样就能使德国随心所欲的决定：和那些国家缔结条约？在什么时候缔结？进攻那些国家？在什么时候进攻？无可怀疑，德、波条约是集体安全大厦首次倾复性的崩塌。希特勒因之而更大胆，更肆无忌惮的采取一连串步骤，以重建德国的武装力量。这些步骤竟毫未受到英法统治者的任何反对，相反地，在一九三五年，英德又在伦敦签订了海军协定，英国竟同意德国建立一支几乎和法国相等的海军力量。在美英法三国的纵容下，法西斯侵略者的胃口愈变愈大了，当时德意两国能毫不困难地进行对阿比西尼亚与西班牙的武装进攻。
    只有苏联始终如一地坚决遵守它的和平政策，见义勇为地为维护阿比西尼亚的平等、独立，维护合法的西班牙共和政府的权利而奋斗。一九三六年一月十日，莫洛托夫在联共中央全会上曾称：“苏联已利用其国联盟员的地位，来执行其反对帝国主义侵略的政策。”并指出：“世界大战的威胁在增长中，在逐步向欧洲蔓延中。”
    早在一九三六年二月十六日的缩军会议上，苏联即曾建议予“侵略与侵略者”以尽可能精确的定义，俾“杜绝一切辩护的借口”，以利集体安全与最大限度的缩军，然而这一建议，竟被遵循英法指令，为德国侵略利益而行动的缩军会议所拒绝了。以李维诺夫为首的苏联驻国联代表团，曾为集体安全而斗争不懈，一九三六年八月三十日苏联代表团向国联秘书长提出了请国联讨论集体安全具体步骤的建议。众所周知，这一建议已被对德国采取“绥靖”政策的英法埋葬在国联档案中了。他们希望以在西方的让步，满足了希特勒的侵略欲望以后，就可以把这一侵略的锋刃，转向东方作为反苏武器。
    为了欺蒙读者与诽谤苏联，美国记者斯坦福曾扬言：苏联反对集体安全，而李维诺夫去职由莫洛托夫继任外交人民委员长一事，就是其转变的明证。有什么比这种说法更愚蠢呢？显而易见，李维诺夫奉行的并不是他自己的政策，而是苏联政府的政策。莫洛托夫的调任，只是因为当时德国正在跃跃欲试，积极准备战争，而美英法又在阴谋把这一战争转向苏联，在这样的关头，必须要一个比李维诺夫更有经验，更孚众望的人来充任外交人民委员长。
    就在这一时期，世界大事上的两条路线，就已经发展起来了。一个是为和平，为组成集体安全，以各爱好和平国家间的共同努力来抵抗侵略的路线。这就是苏联始终如一，不屈不挠地奉行着的路线。另一个是拒绝组成集体安全，拒绝反对侵略的路线，从而，不可避免地鼓励了德意法西斯加速其侵略活动，助成了新战事的发动。如果美国不曾资助希特勒德国的重工业，英法不曾拒绝集体安全，而和苏联共同组织对德国的集体抵抗，那么，希特勒的侵略武器就会感到不足，希特勒的并吞政策就会被集体安全制度所挫败，希特勒发动二次大战的成功的希望，就会减少到最低限度，如果在这样不利的条件下，希特勒党徒还胆敢冒险掀起第二次世界大战，他们在战争的头一年就会被击败。不幸得很，由于美英法三国在整个战前时期所追随的业已破产了的政策，这种情况并没有能发生。允许希特勒在某种程度上成功地发动了持续几近六年，剥夺了人类千百万生命的第二次世界大战的罪人，正是美英法的统治集团。（待一续）
