　　[News from our newspaper] When the employees of Xinhua Bookstore saw the People's Daily report on the 2nd about the Border Government's call to relieve 400,000 disaster-stricken compatriots in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, they spontaneously donated money. Initiated by the plate-making and engraving sections, more than 80 people signed up, donating amounts such as 10,000, 5,000, and 3,000. Comrade Zhang Zheng, an old worker, took out his only savings of 10,000 yuan. In order to expand this movement to all employees, the labor union director convened a mobilization meeting, explaining the severity of the disaster in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the brutality of the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandits, which aroused great indignation. The branch secretary reported to everyone the victorious news of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region eliminating one army headquarters, two division headquarters, and four full brigades of Hu Zongnan, and praised the engraving section comrades who initiated this donation. Then everyone began to discuss it. Some signed up on the spot. Old Yang, a carpenter, immediately signed up to donate 3,000 yuan. The 11 people in the type-casting section donated 53,000 yuan. Administrative cadres donated one or two months' salary. Finally, everyone proposed to withdraw 50,000 yuan from the union's existing membership dues for relief purposes, and to eat less white flour, extracting 150,000 yuan from the mess hall. In this way, including the donations from various comrades, a total of 488,550 yuan was raised.

　　[News from our newspaper] After reading the People's Daily article on the 2nd of this month regarding the Border Government's call for donations to aid disaster-stricken compatriots in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Liaocheng Elementary School in the Second District of Shexian County immediately launched a discussion. Everyone understood that the severe disaster in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia was caused by the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit army. All teachers and students of the school voluntarily donated more than 4,900 yuan to relieve the disaster-stricken compatriots in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. Furthermore, women in Longhu Village in the county and female comrades from the village-stationed organization responded to the government's call and donated a total of 14,600 yuan and 222 eggs to relieve the disaster-stricken compatriots in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia.
