Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Tianjin News: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit Four Big Families' method of "purchasing finished products," used to plunder private industry in North China, has aroused angry criticism from industrial and commercial circles in Beijing and Tianjin. The majority of factories in Tianjin believe that this "selling blood" acquisition method is tantamount to forcing manufacturers to "sign a contract on New Year's Eve" (note: meaning selling real estate on the eve of the old year). Most manufacturers have declared that they "refuse to give blood transfusions to the (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) government." The industrial and commercial circles in Beiping criticized Chiang Kai-shek bandit that "all 'control' agencies have become exploitation agencies," revealing that "'control' only benefits the 'controllers,' 'control' has 'controlled' the whole body until the blood vessels are blocked, and 'controlled' until the third stage of lung disease." Yao Nansheng, Deputy General Manager of Qixin Cement Company, also said: "A portion of Qixin Cement is sold to 'national banks and bureaus,' but the delivery deadline is more than two months later. During this period, how will prices rise? It is unpredictable. This batch of cement acquired by the 'state' (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) will just be goods that can be price-cut in the future." It is reported that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "acquisition of finished products" in Beiping quietly ended in the middle of last month due to opposition from industrial and commercial circles. However, following this, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit issued the so-called "Beiping City Special Handicraft Spring Festival 'Relief' Loan Measures," attempting to plunder and monopolize the famous handicraft production of cloisonné enamel, carved lacquer, bone ware, etc. in Beiping.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Jin-Cha-Ji News: The Mentougou Sino-British Coal Mining Company, seized by the Chiang family gang through "requisition" and turned into its own, recently colluded with the Chiang bandit garrison and the 19th Regiment of the bandit constabulary to openly seal up the Fumin, Mentai, Juxing, Huimin, Sanyi, Yongfu, Yongxing, and Xiechang eight small coal kilns on the 11th in order to expand its territory and annex nearby private small kilns. They also sent bandit troops to guard and forcibly occupy them. The 4,000 workers and kiln owners of the eight kilns are extremely indignant at this. Small kilns in various places, in order to express their support and sympathy, immediately jointly decided to go on strike starting on the 12th and refuse to pay all taxes to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in order to resist this extremely barbaric plunder by the Chiang family gang.

    【新华社陕北二十三日电】津报消息：蒋匪四大家族掠夺华北民营工业之“收购成品”办法，已激起平津工商界愤懑的抨击。津市大多数厂家均认为：这种“卖血”一样的收购办法，无异强迫厂商在“大年三十成契”（按：意即在旧年除夕出卖房地产）。大多数厂家声明“拒绝给（蒋匪）政府‘输血’”。北平工商界抨击蒋匪“一切的‘管制’机关都成为剥削机关”。揭露“‘管制’只有‘管制者’得利，‘管制’已‘管’得全身血脉不通，‘管’成第三期肺病”。启新洋灰公司副总经理姚南笙亦称：“启新洋灰一部分卖给‘国家行局’，可是交货期限要在两个月以后，这个期间，物价上涨如何，都不可预知，‘国家’（蒋匪）收购的这批洋灰，将来刚好是可以轧价的货品”。据悉，北平蒋匪“收购成品”已因工商各界之反对，于上月中悄然结束，但接着蒋匪又颁布所谓“北平市特种手工艺春节‘救济’贷款办法”，图掠夺和垄断平市景泰蓝、雕漆、骨器等著名手工业生产。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】晋察冀讯：蒋家匪帮借“劫收”夺为已有之门头沟中英煤矿公司，近为扩张地盘，并吞附近民营小窑，十一日串同蒋匪驻军及匪宪兵十九团，公然查封福民、门台、聚兴、惠民、三义、永福、永兴、协昌八处小窑，并派匪军把守，强行占有。八窑四千工人及窑主对此均极愤慨，各地小窑为表示支持与同情，当即联合决定自十二日起全体罢工，并拒缴蒋匪一切捐税，以反抗蒋家匪帮此项极端野蛮的掠夺。
