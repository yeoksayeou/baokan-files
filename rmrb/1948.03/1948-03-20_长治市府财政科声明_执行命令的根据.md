Changzhi City Government Finance Section Statement
Basis for Implementing Orders

To the Editor:
    After reading the article "Huguang County Government Issues Statement Clarifying No Overcollection of Labor Service Grain from Workers" published on the front page of the People's Daily on February 20th, we feel that this issue directly involves the basis of Changzhi Municipal Government's implementation of orders. Therefore, we would like to declare the basis for our implementation of orders to everyone.
    In September of last year, we received the Administrative Office's draft of the factory worker burden management method: Article 1 stipulated that "Factory workers, except for workers in military, ordnance, and newspaper industries, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately owned, or the nature of their business, all have the obligation to perform wartime labor service. However, in order to take care of factory production, it is decided that factory workers will pay 20 catties of millet per person per month as a substitute service fee to exempt them from direct participation in labor service." Article 2: "The aforementioned service fee shall be borne equally by the factory and the workers, and shall be paid monthly to the local government where the factory is located..." Article 3: "This provision shall be uniformly implemented in all regions, and any individual methods formulated by counties, districts, and villages shall be abolished."
    This draft was originally intended to solicit opinions from various regions in preparation for implementation, so there was no implementation date. On November 6th, the Administrative Office issued Finance and Administration Order No. 113, which stated in general terms: "The current draft regulations on factory worker wage burdens have been inconsistent in implementation... In order to facilitate collection and unify the burden on factory workers, the provisions of the previous draft method should still be strictly implemented, uniformly handled by each factory. As for when to start collecting, further research and determination are still needed."
    On November 8th, the Third Special District Office convened a meeting of the heads of finance sections of various counties (Comrade Fan, the head of Huguan County, attended and participated), which specifically discussed the Administrative Office's draft method. In addition to the discussion of general issues, the meeting also raised the issue of balancing the burdens between counties, meaning that Changzhi City has many factory workers, and if the service fee all goes to Changzhi City, it would be too advantageous. Therefore, the final resolution was that the service fee millet from larger factories in Changzhi City would be collected by the Special District Office to adjust the burdens of various counties. The remaining small factories would be collected by the Municipal Government, and it was decided that all counties would uniformly collect from November 1st (the resolution is currently stored in the Special District Office).
    Based on the above sections, and after several discussions with factory representatives, we issued an order to collect the service grain for November and December (the Third Special District Office also collected it). To ensure that workers are not burdened from both sides, we issued a formal certificate to whoever's millet we collected.
    We believe that before the Administrative Office has uniformly stipulated the implementation date, the various special districts will inevitably not be able to unify. The current problem is also inevitable, and can still be resolved through mutual consultation to prevent workers from being burdened twice. However, within the jurisdiction of the Third Special District, the resolution of the Special District Office should be resolutely implemented. It seems incorrect that the Huguan County government said that it had not received a formal order, but only saw a letter from the head of the Finance Section of the Special District Office, and therefore could not implement it. Therefore, we hope that the Huguan County government should re-examine the situation and, if it has not deployed this order to lower levels, it should correct it as soon as possible so as to avoid future disputes.

### 长治市府财政科声明　执行命令的根据

　　长治市府财政科声明
  　执行命令的根据编辑同志：
    我们读了二月二十号人民日报第一版登载“壶关县府来信声明没有多收工人差米”的一篇稿子以后，觉着这问题直接牵涉到长治市政府执行命令的根据问题。因此愿把我们执行命令的根据向大家声明一下。
    去年九月间我们接到行署颁发的工厂工人负担办法草案：内中第一条规定：“工厂工人除军火军需及报馆工人外，不论公营私营及经营业务性质，一律有服战时劳役之义务，但为了照顾工厂生产情况，决定工厂工人每人每月交纳服役金小米二十斤，免除其直接参加劳役。”第二条“上项服役金由厂方与工人各出一半，按月向工厂所在地政府交纳…”。第三条“此项规定各地应统一执行，各县、区、村自定之单行办法一律作废。”
    这个草案，原来是征求各地意见，准备实行，因此没有实行日期。到十一月六日，行署又颁发行财政字第一一三号通令，内中大意是说：“目前规定工厂工人工资负担办法草案，在执行上颇不一致……、，为便于征收使工厂工人负担统一，仍应根据前办法草案规定，严格执行，统一由各工厂办理，至于何时起征收，尚须再研究确定”。
    十一月八号三专署召开了各县财政科长会议（壶关县是范科长出席参加的），具体讨论了行署办法草案，除一般问题讨论外，会中还提出县与县的负担平衡问题，意思是说：长治市工厂工人多，如果服役金全归长治市的话太便宜。因此最后决议，长治市较大工厂的服役金米归专署征收，用以调剂各县负担，剩下一些小型工厂，归市政府征收，并决议各县统一自十一月一日起征收（决议现存专署）。
    我们根据了上述各节，又经过工厂代表会的几次讨论，才下命令把十一月十二月份差米征了（三专署也征收了），为了保证工人不两头负担，我们征谁的米，就发给谁一个正式证明书。
    我们认为在行署没有统一规定实行日期以前，各个专区必然不能统一，现在发生问题也是必然的，还可以双方协商解决，不使工人双重负担。但在三专所辖境内是应该坚决执行专署决议的，象壶关县政府所说没有接到正式命令，只见到专署财政科长一封信，似乎还不能执行，恐怕是不对的。因此我们希望壶关县政府，应重新检查一下，如果对这一命令没有向下面布置的话，应从速纠正，以便今后不再发生纠纷。
