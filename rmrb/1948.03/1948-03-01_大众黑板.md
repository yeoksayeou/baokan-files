    ★ On the 26th, our Northeast Army captured the city of Yingkou. This city is located by the sea and is an important port for Chiang Kai-shek to send supplies to his remaining troops in the Northeast. When our army began the attack on the 25th, one of Chiang's divisions inside, totaling more than 10,000 people, revolted under the leadership of Division Commander Wang Jiashen, capturing more than 30 Chiang bandit deputy army commanders and Chiang bandit party and government heads in Yingkou City.
    ★ Labor hero Wu Manyou was a poor refugee before 1934. During the land revolution, he was allocated land and, after seven or eight years of labor, became a new-style rich peasant. According to the law, new-style rich peasants are treated as middle peasants, but after studying the Land Law Outline and Chairman Mao's report, Wu Manyou is willing to dedicate his surplus grain and livestock. After the recovery of Yan'an, the land will be distributed equally by the Farmers' Association. He is currently participating in combat with the army, determined to be a good long-term worker for the people.
