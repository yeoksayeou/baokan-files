Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Comprehensive foreign news agency reports: The second economic storm in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas this year continues to develop, and the people in all parts of the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are living in constant fear. On the 25th in Shanghai, the price of rice soared to an unprecedented high of 3 million Chiang Kai-shek currency per shi, a doubling compared to 1.5 million per dan on February 2nd when the current price surge began, and more than 23 times higher than the highest price of 128,000 yuan per dan in February last year. The black market exchange rate for US dollars rose to 310,000 yuan, doubling in a month and nearly 27 times higher than the 13,000 yuan in February last year. Gold reached 20 million yuan per tael, more than 22 times higher than in February last year. Chinese and foreign stocks rose 15 percent from the 21st to the 23rd, another 20 percent on the 24th compared to the 23rd, and another 15 percent on the 25th. In Guangzhou, the price of rice also reached 3 million yuan per dan on the same day. In Chongqing, the price of rice had already risen to 1.5 million per dan on the 24th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, commodity prices in other inland cities in North and South China in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are rising daily and often changing within hours, causing anxiety among the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. According to Chiang Kai-shek controlled area newspapers: The local finances of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are in extreme distress. The total draft budget for Guangxi Province this year: expenditures of over 336.3 billion Chiang Kai-shek currency, with revenue only about one-tenth of that, or over 37.15 billion yuan, leaving a deficit of over 299.1 billion yuan. The total budget for Suiyuan for the first half of the year: expenditures of over 170 billion yuan, with revenue of about 20 billion yuan, also a deficit of over 150 billion yuan. Last year, the expenditures of various provinces and cities under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were extremely large, and the deficits filled by the Chiang Kai-shek central government alone amounted to over 2.1 trillion yuan. The Chiang Kai-shek central government's subsidies to local areas also vary depending on whether they are direct or indirect affiliates. For example, the shortfall in revenue and expenditure in Jiangsu last year was fully subsidized with appropriations; this year, the shortfall in Suiyuan will only be granted a subsidy for 70% of civil servant salaries based on the salary level of November last year. The shortfall in Guangxi is still unresolved. The county-level deficits in various provinces are not being addressed at all, and the Chiang Kai-shek central government is not even filling the county-level deficits in Jiangsu, its heartland. Under these circumstances, the Chiang Kai-shek regime in various provinces and counties is extorting the people on a large scale. The head of the Chiang Kai-shek Finance Department of Jiangsu openly said: "The most difficult thing is county finance, and the only way to increase revenue is to 'rectify' taxation." Guangxi is also preparing to "open up tax sources." Suiyuan is plundering farmland and collecting land rent. The provincial government stipulates that each county government must "operate" at least 500 qing this year, and the six counties in western Suiyuan each occupy 1,000 qing of land. The bandit provincial government has sent a large number of personnel to western Suiyuan to "operate" this income.

　　沪物价续暴涨
  　大米每石三百万元
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合外国通讯社消息：蒋区今年第二次经济风暴继续发展，全蒋区各地人民惶惶不可终日。上海二十五日大米每石涨到蒋币三百万元的空前高峰，较此次涨风开始时的二月二日每担一百五十万，上涨一倍，较去年二月的最高价每担十二万八千元，上涨二十三倍以上。美钞黑市涨到三十一万元，较一个月前涨了一倍，较去年二月的一万三千元，上涨将近二十七倍。黄金每两二千万，较去年二月上涨二十二倍以上，中外股票二十一日到二十三日涨百分之十五，二十四日较二十三日又涨百分之二十，二十五日再涨百分之十五。广州同日米价每担亦达三百万。重庆二十四日大米每担已涨到一百五十万。据美联社二十五日沪电称：蒋区其他华北与华南内地城市的物价均逐日上升，且常在数小时内即有变动，人民惶惶不安。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据蒋区报纸透露：蒋匪地方财政极端困窘。本年席广西省级总预算：岁出蒋币三千三百六十三亿余万元，岁入仅约十分之一，即三百七十一亿五千余万元，不敷二千九百九十一亿余万元。绥远上半年总预算：支出一千七百余亿元，收入约二百亿元，亦字亦达一千五百余亿元。去年度蒋匪各省市支出极其庞大，其赤字仅由蒋匪中央填补者即达二万一千余亿元。蒋匪中央对地方之补助，复视嫡系与旁系而有差异，如去年对江苏收支差额，全部拨款补助；今年绥远差额，则仅对公务员薪给一项准照去年十一月份薪给发七成。广西差额且犹虚悬未决。各省之县级赤字则毫无着落，蒋匪中央对其心脏地区之江苏县级差额亦不予填补。在此情况下，各省县蒋匪政权即向人民大肆搜刮。江苏蒋匪财政厅长公开说：“最感困难者为县财政，惟有借‘整顿’税收，以裕财源而已”。广西亦准备“开辟税源”。绥远则掠夺民田，抽收地租，该省省府规定：各县县府本年至少须“经营”五百顷，绥西六县且各占田地千顷。该匪省府已派大批人员在绥西“经营”此项收入。
