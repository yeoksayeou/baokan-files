　　Border Government Issues Instructions to Rectify Schools at All Levels
  　Implement a Firm Class Line
    Transform and Cultivate Intellectuals to Serve the People
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The Border Region Government issued "Instructions on Rectifying Schools at All Levels" on the 6th of this month. It first pointed out: "Under the current victorious situation of thoroughly distributing land and overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek, the main task of education in the Border Region is how to implement a firm and clear class line, adapt to the demands of the broad masses after their liberation, improve the people's cultural level, and transform and cultivate intellectuals to serve the people." It continued: "The central content of this rectification focuses on strengthening the ideological education of teachers and students, enhancing their class consciousness, and establishing a normal teaching system on this basis, in order to effectively improve students' cultural level." Therefore, "From now on, no matter what level of school, we must first pay attention to cultivating intellectuals from the laboring people, especially children of poor and hired peasants. We should use our greatest efforts to solve their difficulties in attending school; general school public funding quotas should take care of them, and all kinds of fully publicly funded schools should pay more attention to absorbing them." At the same time, it pointed out: "Today's so-called national education, in rural areas, mainly takes peasant children as the main body. At the same time, children of landlords and rich peasants should also be allowed to attend school, that is, various publicly funded schools should not generally refuse to accept them." Regarding how to treat intellectuals with landlord and rich peasant backgrounds, the instructions stipulated: "For teachers and students of landlord and rich peasant backgrounds currently in schools, the main approach is to adopt a policy of education and transformation, striving for them to serve the people. All those who express their willingness to abandon their original class position, are willing to serve the people, and are not deeply sinful elements hiding in schools intentionally to evade struggle, should be helped to transform and allowed to continue working and studying in the school. It is wrong to simply pay attention to background without distinction and cleanse everyone." It also pointed out: "Schools are educational institutions, and the class line of education should be manifested in the strong ideological leadership of New Democracy. Establishing poor peasant organizations in schools, and applying the methods of fighting landlords in the countryside to school life, must be corrected." Finally, in order to oppose blindness in education, it was specifically proposed that in the future, when schools combine learning with practice in land reform and production movements, they must have a certain plan in order to achieve the goal of effectively transforming ideology and improving culture.

　　边府发出整顿各级学校指示
  　贯彻坚定的阶级路线
    改造培养为人民服务的知识分子
    【本报讯】边区政府于本月六日颁发“关于整顿各级学校的指示”，首先指出：“边区教育在目前彻底平分土地，打倒蒋介石的胜利形势下，主要任务是如何贯彻坚定明确的阶级路线，适应广大群众翻身后的要求，提高人民文化水平，改造与培养为人民服务的知识分子。”继称：“这一整顿的中心内容，着重在加强教员、学生的思想教育，提高其阶级认识，在这个基础上建立正常的教学制度，以求实际有效的提高学生文化水平。”因此，“今后不论那一级学校，首先要注重培养劳动人民中的知识分子，特别是贫雇子弟，应该以最大力量解决他们上学困难；一般学校公费名额应照顾他们，完全公费之各种学校，更应注意吸收他们入学。”同时指出：“今天所谓国民教育，在农村来说，主要是以农民子弟为主体，同时，地富子弟也应允许同样入学，即各种公费学校，也不应一般拒收。”关于如何对待地富成份的知识分子问题，指示中规定：“对现在在学校中的地富成份的教员、学生，主要是采取教育改造方针，争取他们为人民服务。凡表示愿意放弃其原阶级立场，愿意为人民服务，不是隐蔽在学校内有意逃避斗争的罪大恶极分子，都应帮助他们改造，允许继续留校工作与学习，仅注意成份不加区别，一律清洗的做法是错误的。”并且指出：“学校是教育机关，教育的阶级路线应表现为新民主主义的坚强的思想领导，在学校内建立贫雇组织，以及拿乡村斗争地主的一套办法，套进学校生活，是必须纠正的。”最后，为了反对教育上的盲目性，特别提出今后在土改与生产运动中，学校结合实际进行学习时，必须有一定的计划，以求达到有效的改造思想，提高文化的目的。
