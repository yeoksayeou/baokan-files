　　Many Livestock Deaths in Chakou
　　All Regions Should Pay Attention to Prevention
　　[This Newspaper's Report] The chief doctor of the Beida Veterinary Hospital's Zhuzhitou Branch, upon hearing about the numerous livestock deaths in Chakou Village, Wu'an, traveled to the village on March 6th to conduct an investigation.
　　The village has approximately 700 households and around 250-260 head of livestock. From June of last year to the end of February this year, 103 head of livestock have died, including 44 mules and horses, and 59 donkeys. According to local residents, some livestock die as soon as they show symptoms, leaving no time for treatment, while others survive for a day or two longer. After death, the livestock either have several cracks in their lungs, yellow swelling in their throats that prevents breathing, or yellowing of the heart with the tip of the heart rotting. Some die from bleeding from the nostrils, while others have ruptured gallbladders. Based on these symptoms, the causes of the disease are as follows: 1. Negligence in feeding livestock, resulting in the consumption of moldy grain. Mold is a type of bacteria that easily causes jaundice or other diseases in the livestock's stomach. 2. Excessive fatigue in livestock. In the hot summer weather, inadequate feeding, alternating between hunger and fullness, or feeding the livestock grass and fodder immediately after strenuous activity without rest, can easily lead to jaundice. 3. Livestock that are too fat, experiencing blood heat in the spring, becoming easily agitated, rubbing off hair on walls, or being startled are prone to jaundice. In addition, attention should be paid to transmission. The causes of transmission: meat from livestock that died of jaundice, or broth from the meat, being spilled in the livestock pen, at the edge of the village, or on the road; livestock smelling it can be infected. Tying livestock together with those suffering from jaundice, feeding them from the same trough, smelling the feces and urine of sick livestock, smelling the bones of dead livestock, or smelling the blood that flows out during the treatment of jaundice will all cause transmission.
　　In addition to paying strict attention to the causes of the disease and the transmission of jaundice, daily attention should also be paid to changes in the livestock. For example, if the livestock is panicked and restless, paws the ground with its front hooves, or bites the trough, it indicates the presence of heart jaundice. If it takes a sip of water and immediately retreats several steps, then goes back to drink calmly, it indicates the presence of lung jaundice, as cold water will cause lung pain and restlessness. If the livestock arches its back while standing, stretching its front legs forward and its hind legs backward, it indicates the presence of intestinal jaundice. If the livestock's ear roots are swollen, or the scrotum of the hind legs is swollen, it indicates the presence of kidney jaundice. If the livestock is usually in good spirits but suddenly closes its eyes and cannot open them, its eyeballs are red, and it lowers its head and does not raise it, it indicates the presence of liver jaundice. If any of these phenomena are discovered, treatment should be administered immediately.

### 茶口牲口死亡多　各地都要注意预防

　　茶口牲口死亡多
  　各地都要注意预防
    【本报消息】北大兽医院住冶陶分院主医生，听到武安茶口村，死亡牲口很多，特于三月六日跑到该村进行调查。
    该村约有七百户人家，约有牲口二百五六十头，自去年六月间开始到今年二月底，就死了牲口一百零三头，其中有四十四个骡马，五十九个驴。据当地群众谈：有的牲口发现了病就死，赶不得治，有的能延长一两日。死后的牲口不是肺上裂了几条缝，便是咽喉上生了黄肿的出不上气来，或心上生黄，心的尖上都烂了。有的是鼻孔出血而死，有的是胆烂了。根据以上症状研究，得病的原因有以下几点：一、因为在喂牲口时不注意，把霉坏了的粮食喂给牲口吃。霉了的东西是一种病菌，在牲口肚里容易使牲口得黄症或其他病症。二、因为牲口疲劳过度，在夏天天气太热，喂不周到，饥一顿饱一顿，或因牲口急走未经休息，即给喂草料也容易得黄症。三、牲口吃的太胖，春季血热，牲口好起性，或在墙上擦掉毛尾，或受了惊慌，都容易得黄病。此外要注意传染。传染的原因：患黄病死了的牲口的肉，或肉的汤泼在牲口圈内或村边或路上，牲口闻了会传染，与得黄病的牲口在一起拴，或在一个槽上喂，或闻了病牲口的粪尿，或闻着死了牲口的骨头，或闻了黄病牲口在治疗时剌破流出的血水都会传染。
    预防办法，除了对得病原因与传染黄病加以严格的注意外，还应在日常注意牲口的变化。如牲口惊慌不安，或前蹄刨地，或咬槽榜，这是已生了心黄。在饮水时喝一口立即倒退数步，再上前去安然喝水，这是肺上已经生了黄病，凉水喝下去，肺痛必然不安。牲口站立时拱起背，前腿前蹬后腿后蹬，这是已生了肠黄。如牲口耳朵根上发肿，后腿拐蛋泡发肿，这是已生了肾黄。如果牲口平时精神很好，突然眼闭不张，眼珠发红，低头不抬，这是已生了肝黄。如果发现了以上这几种现象，应马上治疗。
