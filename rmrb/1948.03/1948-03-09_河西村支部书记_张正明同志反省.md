　　Hexi Village Branch Secretary
  　Comrade Zhang Zhengming's Reflection
    I joined the Party in June 1942. At that time, my class background was lower-middle peasant. I became the branch secretary soon after joining the Party. After becoming the secretary, I felt a bit "arrogant." I had been a cadre outside the Party, serving as deputy militia captain, chairman of the farmers' association, and village head. When I became a cadre in early 1942, I was still able to stand with the masses, and my thinking was relatively progressive. For example, during the struggle against hidden land grain in July 1942, several cadres wanted to embezzle more than 1,000 catties of hidden land rice. I disagreed and resolutely reported it to Comrade Chen Dadong of the work team, and they didn't succeed in embezzling it. Later, the higher-ups saw that I was reliable and promoted me to be the chairman of the farmers' association. At that time, I was clearing old debts from landlords. Although I didn't have any debts myself, I actively led the masses in doing it. This isn't to say that I didn't make any mistakes. In fact, after only a few good days, I became detached from the masses. Therefore, I made many mistakes in the seven or eight years of work, the biggest of which are the following:
    Because my class consciousness was unclear and my stance was unstable, after becoming a cadre, especially after becoming the branch secretary and village head, I felt that I was remarkable, conceited, and felt I had support. The district committee trusted me, and my work gradually became dictatorial. My view of the masses changed, and I thought of the masses as easy to "command" and looked down on them. I thought that cadres couldn't be offended, but offending the masses didn't matter. After becoming a cadre, the masses were afraid of my face, and I would show my attitude to the masses when I was unhappy. I was indeed standing on the heads of the masses and oppressing people. The year before last, when preparing stretchers for the attack on Anyang, the self-defense captain asked Shuangquan to go, but Shuangquan didn't want to. He raised the opinion, saying: "If I'm not allowed to buy the fruits of the struggle, I won't go!" Relying on my position as village head, I personally detained him. At that time, the struggle accounts hadn't been settled yet. Zhang Fu made a suggestion, saying: "The village head doesn't give an account. Where did the 600,000+ go?" After hearing this, I thought Zhang Fu was being disruptive and detained him as well, releasing him only after two days. Last May, during the "face washing and black wiping" (a stage in land reform), I was dissatisfied, and when the masses raised opinions, I thought: "You go ahead and raise them! As long as you don't make any mistakes in the future!" This was my thought of revenge. At that time, Zhang Fu raised many opinions, and I later retaliated against him, using the excuse that he said "disruptive" words and detaining him for three days. Finally, he was expelled from the farmers' association and not given any of the fruits of the struggle. These two facts alone show how I bullied the masses. Also, in the past, I always looked down on "those who don't say a word," calling them "backward." Today, I understand very well that the people I used to call "backward" were my own poor brothers. In the past, I was dictatorial, suppressed the poor and hired peasants, leaving them no position and no right to speak, and I also attacked many of the masses. How could the poor and hired not be afraid, how dare they say more? So the masses were afraid of me. I relied on being a cadre, and the power was in my hands. I could do whatever I wanted. This is truly the Kuomintang official style described in the letter to Party members, a set of methods for landlords to oppress the masses.
    In addition, I was also selfish and protected cadres, which also offended many of the masses. For example, during the great famine in 1943, the village struggled against hidden land grain, and many cadres ate more and embezzled; some have not returned it to this day. Like Zhang Qizhen, the vice chairman of the farmers' association at that time, illegally ate 180 catties of rice. At the time, I thought that even if he sold all his property, he wouldn't be able to pay it back, so I let it go casually. But what about the masses? Several people starved to death at that time, all of them poor families. I was the political director at that time, leading the whole situation, but I lost my position and protected the cadres, watching the masses starve to death. What a great sin this is! Anyway, in the past, when the masses reported cadres, I would also lead the cadres and Party members to conduct self-criticism. When the cadres didn't admit it, I would come down and pursue the masses, saying that the masses were being disruptive; I had no principles toward the cadres, afraid of offending them, because I myself had the wrong idea, thinking "how can there be no mistakes in doing work?" So I didn't think much of the cadres' mistakes. I had sectarianism in my thinking, thinking that cadres and activists were a unit, so I protected them and attacked the masses, thus getting further and further away from the masses. Since the joint struggle in Hexi in the spring of 1946, up to the "filling and leveling" movement, the distribution of fruits was unfair each time. The cadres always picked the good ones first and bought them, and then it was the masses' turn. For example, when struggling against Zhang Wenyu and two other landlords, there were many things, and it was decided to let each cadre pick one item first, but later many bought three or five items. The masses' reaction was very bad, and the district asked them to return them, but in the end they didn't return them, and it was casually dropped. Almost all of the fruits of that struggle were bought by the cadres. On the surface, it was said that the masses could buy whatever they wanted, but in reality, the masses were only allowed to buy what the cadres and appraisers had left over. Later, the masses' reaction was not good, and the branch discussed changing the method to grading, with the first grade being dependents of revolutionary soldiers (mostly middle peasants), so most of the good things were taken by the middle-class households. There was no care for the poor and hired, especially the lonely, elderly, and weak, thinking that they were about to die, so what use were they? So they were given very little. How could the masses be satisfied with these methods? Our work in the past did not follow the mass line, but the "cadre line."
    My selfishness was also very serious. The year before last, after the mass emancipation movement began, I was already the village head, and my thinking changed. I knew that the landlords were afraid of the struggle and would sell their land, so I first sold eight mu of bad land; after the joint struggle, I bought seven mu and two fen of good land (including four mu of wheat that yielded one shi and two dou). At that time, the masses were dissatisfied. Originally, the blacksmith Xianbao wanted it, and he said, "If the village head doesn't want it, I'll take it!" I said, "If you want it, you can have it," but in reality, I still wanted it. In September of the year of the joint struggle, the government auctioned off the confiscated landlord's houses. I thought to myself, "Other people are cadres and have good houses. I am also a cadre and must show off!" So I bought half a string of glass-tiled courtyards. After buying it, I immediately regretted it, thinking that if I hadn't bought the good courtyard, wouldn't I be able to exchange it for another one this time? Because I was selfish and planned for myself, coupled with my unclear class nature, I also coveted the small benefits of the struggle households. During the clearing of old debts in 1942, Zhang Jimei's land was cleared back by Zhang Xirui, Zhang Xirui sent me three and a half catties of pork. I didn't want it, but he insisted on giving it to me, and in the end, I left it. In the spring of 1944, I cleared back a house for Zhang Xibang, and he sent me 500 yuan in the dark to thank me. At the time, I estimated that this was not appropriate, and after taking it, I returned 350 yuan to him, saying that the 150 yuan was to offset the money I borrowed from him. Later, he sent me more than ten catties of coal, and I burned it. I took his money and bought three mu of land. These are all things that lost my position and let down the Party and the masses!
    At the beginning of the Party rectification, I was resistant. Later, with the help of the work team, after reading the letter to Party members at the branch meeting, my thinking began to move. I felt that I had turned over higher than the masses, which was wrong as a Party member. Later, the masses gave us a lot of opinions, and my thinking changed. If it weren't for the Party rectification, I wouldn't have realized these mistakes of mine. Especially after the masses raised their opinions, I was very pained in my heart. I thought, what did I join the revolution for? Why do I want to rule the masses today? Why do I beat my own masses into that state! Detaining people in cold rooms at every turn. In the past, the landlords bullied the masses, and the masses didn't dare to say anything or provoke them; we knocked down the landlords, and the masses became afraid of the cadres again. A few days ago, the newspaper published a short biography of Jia Zhengfang from our village. I cried as I read it. The poor and hired were in such pain, and we still attacked them and said they were "backward." Isn't this forgetting our roots? Now I understand that the masses were dissatisfied with us in the past not because we were cadres, but because we did bad things and offended the masses, which also affected the Party's prestige in Hexi. I now feel that it's not too late to correct mistakes, and not correcting them is a dead end. A few days ago, I invited the members of the poor peasant league to participate in the branch meeting, and they pointed out: "It's not enough to just talk. We don't know what kind of heart you have. We have to see your actions in the future!" It's reasonable for them not to be at ease. Last year, during the "face washing and black wiping," we retaliated after the masses raised their opinions. How can they be at ease! In the future, we must show the masses the facts. That day at the branch meeting, I also expressed to the members of the poor peasant league: "I am a Communist Party member, not a Kuomintang landlord. I will do what I say, and I will definitely change what I say I will change!"
    Finally, I also want to recall two points. This time, the masses helped with the Party rectification and gave a lot of opinions, which gave me a great education. I realize that Party rectification is not only for the higher-ups to rectify, but also for the masses to rectify. The masses will not allow us! I have no resentment at all for the masses giving me opinions, just regret! I am the branch secretary and village head, and I have done so many wrong things. Who should the masses give opinions to if not me? If I don't rectify myself this time, the Party won't want me, and the masses won't want me. In the future, I will only listen to the Party's words, stand with the masses, firmly rely on the poor and hired, and honestly be a good farmhand for the masses. Now the Party is also public, and the masses are watching our words and actions, which is a great force for us to correct our mistakes. (Compiled by Gu Wei)

### 河西村支部书记　张正明同志反省

　　河西村支部书记
  　张正明同志反省
    我是一九四二年六月入党，那时我的成份是下中农，入党不久就担任了支部书记。当了支书后我就觉得有些“气粗”了，我在党外也是一直当干部，民兵副队长、农会主任、村长都当过。我四二年初当干部后，自己还是能和群众站在一起，思想也比较进步，比如四二年七月反黑地粮斗争，有几个干部要贪污黑地米一千多斤，我是不同意的，坚决的报告了工作队的陈大东同志，他们没有贪污成。以后上级看到我可靠，提拔我担任了农会主任，那时向地主清理旧债，我虽然没有债，但还是积极的领导群众干，这些不是说我没有错误，实际上好了没有几天，我就脱离群众了，所以在七八年的工作中也就犯了不少的错误，最大的错误有下边的几个：
    因为我的阶级观念不明，立场不稳，所以当了干部后，特别是当了支书，又当了村长以后，就感到自己了不起，自高自大，觉得有依靠，分委相信咱，工作也就慢慢地独断专行了。对群众的看法就不一样了，思想上认为群众好“使唤”，瞧不起群众，干部们惹下不行，惹下群众没有啥。自当干部后，群众就怕我的脸，一不高兴就对群众耍态度，我确实是站在群众头上压迫人。前年打安阳准备担架，自卫队长让双全去，双全不愿去，人家提出意见说：“斗争果实不让我买我就不去！”自己仗凭村长地位，亲自把人家扣起来。就在那时，斗争帐还没算，张福提了个意见说：“村长不给算帐，斗争了六十几万到那里了。”我听到后认为张福是破坏，也把人家扣起来，扣了两天才放出来。去年五月洗脸擦黑时，我的思想就不满意，群众提意见时，我就想着：“你提吧！只要你以后不犯错误！”这就是我的报复思想。那时张福提了不少意见，以后对人家就实行了报复，借口说人家说“破坏”话，扣了三天，最后开除出农会，不分给斗争果实。光只这两个事实，就可以看出我是怎的欺侮群众。还有就是我过去总是看不起“那些死不吭气的人，”骂他“落后”。今天已经很明白了，过去我骂“落后”的人，就是自己的穷弟兄。过去自己独断专行，把贫雇压的没有地位，没有人家发言权，而且还打击了不少的群众，那贫雇怎个不骇怕，怎敢多说话呢？所以群众都怕咱，咱仗凭干部，权在咱手，想怎办就怎办，这真是告党员书说的国民党老爷作风，是地主欺压群众的一套办法。
    另外就是自私自利，包庇干部，这样也得罪了不少群众。比如四三年大灾荒，村上斗争黑地粮，许多干部多吃、贪污；有的至今没有还，象那时候农会副主任张启真，非法吃了一百八十斤米，我当时想着，他把全部家产变卖了也还不起，所以马马虎虎就搁下去了，但是群众呢？在那时却饿死了好几个，都是穷户，我那时是政治主任，领导全盘，我却失掉了立场，包庇干部，眼看的让群众饿死，这是多大的罪过？反正过去群众对干部有反映时，我也领导干部党员检讨，干部们不承认时，下来就追群众，说群众是破坏；我对干部是没有原则，怕得罪他们，因我自己就有错误的想法，认为“做工作还能没错误”？所以对干部的错误觉得没啥。我思想上有宗派，认为干部积极分子是一把子，所以就包庇他们，打击群众，这样跟群众越离越远了。河西从四六年春天，联合斗争以来，到填补运动，在每次分果实，都不公道，都是干部先挑好的买了然后才轮到群众。如斗争张文峪等两个地主时，东西很多，决定让干部每人先挑一件，但以后买三件五件的很多，群众反映很坏，区上让退，结果也没退，马马虎虎丢开了。那次的斗争果实，差不多是让干部们都买走了，表面上说是群众要买啥就买啥，实际上还是干部评议员挑剩下的才让群众买，以后群众反映的不行，支部就讨论改个法儿，改成订等级，头等是抗属（多是中农），这样好东西大部又叫中等户拿走了，对贫雇特别是孤独老弱，就没有照顾，认为他们快死了，还有啥用？所以就给分的很少。这些办法群众还能满意？我们的工作过去走的不是群众路线，而是“干部路线”。
    我的自私自利也很厉害。前年，群众翻身大运动开始后，那时我已经当了村长，思想就变了，知道地主们怕斗争就要卖地，我就先把八亩赖地卖了；联合斗争后就买下了七亩二分好地（内有四亩麦子打了一石二斗），那时群众就不满意，本来铁匠贤保想要，他说：“村长不要我就要！”我就说：“你要你就要”，实际上还是我要了。联合斗争那年九月，政府拍卖被没收了的地主房子，自己就想“人家当干部都有了好房子，我也是干部也得排气、排气（阔气之意）！”所以就买下了半串玻璃院。买下以后，接着就是填平补齐，我又后悔了，觉得我就不买好院，这次还不给换一座？因为我自私自利，为个人打算，加上我阶级性不明，所以也贪图过斗争户的小利，四二年清理旧债，张介眉的地叫张锡瑞清回去了，张锡瑞给我送了三斤半猪肉，我不要他硬给，最后还是留下了。四四年春天给张锡邦清理回一座房子，他在黑夜给我送去五百块钱酬谢我，当时我估计这样不合适，要下以后又还了他三百五十元，那一百五十元说的是顶借他的，以后他又给我送去十几斤煤我也烧了。我拿上他的钱自己又扯了一点买了三亩地。这些都是失掉立场的事，也对不住党，对不住群众！
    整党刚开始时，我是有抵抗的。以后经过工作组的帮助，在支部会上念了告党员书，我的思想就动起来了，我就感到我翻身比群众高，作为一个党员这是不对的。后来群众给我们提了很多的意见，我的思想才转过来，要不是整党，我也认识不到我的这些错误，特别是群众提意见后，我心上痛苦的很，我就想我参加革命是为了啥？今天为啥要统治群众？为啥把自己的群众打击成那个样！动不动就关在冷房子里。过去地主欺侮群众，群众不敢吭不敢惹；咱们把地主打下去了，群众又怕起干部来了。前些日子，报上登了咱村贾正方的小传，我看的看的就哭了，贫雇那样的痛苦，我们还要打击，还要说人家“落后”，这不是忘了本吗？现在我想通了，过去群众不满意我们，不是因为当了干部，是我们做了坏事得罪了群众，还叫党的威信在河西受了影响。我现在觉得，有错改错不算迟，不改就是死路一条。前两天请贫农团委员参加支部会，人家指出：“光说不行，不知咱是个啥心肝眼，要看今后行动！”人家不放心是有道理的。去年洗脸擦黑时，群众提了意见后，我们有报复行为，人家还能放心！今后一定拿出事实给群众看。那天开支部会我也向贫农团委员表示：“我是共产党，不是国民党地主，说到就要做到，说改一定要改！”
    最后，我还想起两点来，这次群众帮助整党，提了好多意见，给我教育很大。我认识到整党不但是上级要整，也是群众要整，群众不让我们！群众给我提意见，我一点怀恨也没有，光觉得后悔！我是支书，又是村长，办了那么多错误事，群众不给我提意见给谁提？这次再不整好，党不会要我，群众也不会要我，以后只有听党的话，和群众站在一起，坚决依靠贫雇，老老实实给群众当个好长工。现在党也公开了，群众眼看着我们这些党员的言语行动，这对我们改正错误是个很大的力量。（谷维整理）
