The Bian District Government Calls on the Entire District to Donate to Disaster-Stricken Compatriots in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to aid the compatriots in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region who have suffered from the Jiang-caused disaster, the Bian District Government has issued a call to the entire district, the full text of which is as follows:

The Jiang-Hu bandit troops, risking their advance into the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, have been continuously dealt annihilating blows by our Northwest military and civilians with the spirit of heroic sacrifice and arduous struggle. Now the Hu bandits are in a desperate situation, facing the fate of total annihilation. However, in the past year, the bandit troops, in their desperate struggle, have implemented a scorched-earth policy, unleashing their ferocity on our Northwest people. Large numbers of young men were taken away and killed, and resources and houses were plundered and burned. According to statistics, as of now, more than 230,000 pieces of farm equipment have been destroyed, more than 65,000 head of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses have been lost, more than 170,000 pigs and sheep have been lost, more than 150,000 catties of cotton have been lost, more than 47,000 spinning machines have been lost, and more than 500,000 mu of seedlings have been trampled. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was originally a region with barren land, sparse population, and backward production. Under the direct leadership of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao, production was developed, the economy was prospered, and the people were able to become wealthy and live a prosperous life, becoming the most democratic, free, and happy holy land in the country. Unfortunately, it was ravaged by bandit troops, causing a major disaster. This shows how much Jiang Kai-shek hates the people. Wherever the bandit troops go, the people have no possibility of living safely. Although most of the area has now been recovered, up to 400,000 people have suffered the most from the Jiang-caused disaster, with no clothes to wear and no food to eat, enduring hunger and cold, and urgently waiting for relief. The vast number of disaster victims not only face current living difficulties, but also due to the destruction of production, the cultivated area last year has shrunk by 20% to 30%. Currently, vigorous assistance is urgently needed to complete spring plowing and production. The people of our entire liberated area are as close as brothers, sharing weal and woe. We should help the area where the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao are located, which has suffered a serious Jiang-caused disaster, and should not stand idly by. For this reason, in addition to allocating 200,000 shi of public grain to relieve the disaster victims on behalf of the people of our region, this government hereby calls on the entire region to save food and clothing, share hardships, reduce expenditures, and actively donate to relieve the urgent needs. However, due to the long distance and inconvenient transportation, it is best to donate more cash, medicine, and cloth. As long as everyone pays attention to a little bit of saving, it will not be difficult to gather a large sum of money. I hope that all agencies, troops, schools, and individuals in the entire border region will promote the spirit of mutual assistance and respond to the call for relief. This will not only enable the disaster-stricken compatriots in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia to recover as soon as possible, but also greatly benefit the progress of the revolution.

(All donations from various places should be remitted to this government by the Administrative Office for transmittal to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region)

　　边府号召全区
  　捐助陕甘宁灾胞
    【本报消息】为援助陕甘宁边区遭受蒋灾难胞，边区政府特向全区发出号召，全文如下：蒋胡匪军，冒险进犯陕甘宁边区，经我西北军民以英勇牺牲艰苦奋斗的精神，不断给予歼灭性的打击，现在胡匪已陷于进退维谷的绝境，面临着全军覆没的命运。但是一年来匪军在绝望挣扎中，大施三光政策，向我西北人民逞其凶暴，大批壮丁被拉走和杀害，资材房屋被掠夺和焚烧。据统计截至目前，农具毁坏二十三万余件，牛驴骡马损失六万五千余头，猪羊十七万余只，棉花十五万余斤，纺织机四万七千余架，青苗被践踏五十余万亩。陕甘宁边区过去本来是地瘠人稀生产落后的地区，在中共中央毛主席直接领导下，发展生产，繁荣经济，使人民都得发家致富，丰衣足食，成为全国最民主、自由、幸福的圣地。乃不幸遭匪军蹂躏，造成重灾，这说明蒋匪是怎样的仇恨人民，匪军所到的地方，人民便没有安全生活下去的可能。现在大部地区虽已收复，但遭受蒋灾最重的达四十万人，没有衣穿、没有饭吃，忍饥熬寒，急盼赈济。广大灾民不仅目前生活困难，而且由于生产被破坏，去年耕地面积已缩小百分之二十到三十，目前急需大力援助，完成春耕生产。我整个解放区人民情同手足，休戚相关，对中共中央和毛主席所在地区，遭受严重蒋灾，自更应尽力相助，不容袖手旁观。为此本府除已代我区人民拨运二十万市石公粮救济外，特再号召全区，节衣缩食，与共甘苦，樽节开支，踊跃捐助，以济眉急。唯以路途遥远，运输不便，最好多捐助现款、医药、布匹，只要大家注意一点一滴的节约，自不难汇集一笔巨资。望我全边区机关、部队、学校以及个人，发扬互助精神，响应救济号召，这不仅使陕甘宁灾胞早庆复苏，并也对革命前进大有裨益。
    　　　　　（所有各地捐款统由行署汇解本府，以便转送陕甘宁边区）
