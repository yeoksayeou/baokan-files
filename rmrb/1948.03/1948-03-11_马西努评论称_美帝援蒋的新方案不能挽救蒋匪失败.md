Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 9th: Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu’s commentary on the new US imperialist aid plan to Chiang Kai-shek to invade China on February 26th. The gist of the commentary stated: The new US $570 million “Aid to China (Chiang)” plan is a continuation of the US policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war, interfering in China's internal affairs, and turning China into a US colony and military base for the past two and a half years. US imperialism is adding fuel to the fire of the Chinese civil war in order to make the Kuomintang more dependent on them, so as to steal more sovereignty from China. Simultaneously with the announcement of the plan, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to obtain new aid, have agreed to the US rule over South China and sold Taiwan to them. The Tianjin Yi Shi Evening News reported on February 6th: The Kuomintang and the United States have reached an agreement in principle on the development of South China. The newspaper believes that Americans feel safer investing in South China. Truman also revealed this point in his message to Congress. As for the Taiwan issue, the Tianjin Yi Shi Evening News said: In addition to military resources, the United States intends to turn Taiwan into a US air and naval base in the Far East. Reuters reported on February 13th: Wang Shijie claimed at the standing committee meeting of the (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) "National Political Council" that China (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) supports the US plan to restore Europe and Japan. Nanjing newspapers reported that on February 17th, the (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) Executive Yuan passed a resolution to ease restrictions on Japanese industry. This indicates that in order to obtain US aid, the Kuomintang has agreed to make China's foreign policy more subordinate to the interests of US imperialism.
    The new US aid plan to China (Chiang Kai-shek) represents the continued strengthening of US imperialist expansion in China. However, the US expansion is being carried out in a new situation, which favors the forces of national liberation and is detrimental to imperialist aggression and the Kuomintang reactionary forces. Truman's message to Congress, the State Department's memorandum, and Marshall's speech all had to admit the bankruptcy of the Kuomintang rule and the bankruptcy of the US policy of interfering in China's internal affairs. They admitted that since the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang has been given enormous aid, including a large amount of military aid, which has been detailed in the memorandum published by the State Department. However, this aid cannot guarantee the "temporary respite" needed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is relying on the assistance of the entire people to continuously increase its strike force. They are determined to continue their victory until they liberate the entire Chinese territory.

### 马西努评论称　美帝援蒋的新方案不能挽救蒋匪失败

　　马西努评论称
  　美帝援蒋的新方案不能挽救蒋匪失败
    【新华社陕北九日电】上月二十六日莫斯科电台广播马西努关于美帝援蒋侵华新计划的评论，大意说：美国五亿七千万美元的“援华（蒋）”新计划，是美国最近两年半来援蒋内战，干涉中国内政和变中国为美国殖民地及军事基地之政策的继续。美帝在中国内战火上加油，是为了使国民党更加依赖他们，以便窃取中国更多主权。与该计划宣布同时，国民党反动派为获得新的援助已同意美国对华南的统治，并将台湾出卖给他们。二月六日天津益世晚报报导：国民党与美国关于发展华南问题在原则上已达到协议。该报认为美国人自以为投资华南，比较安全。杜鲁门在致国会咨文中也泄露了这点。至于台湾的问题，天津益世晚报说：除了军事资源问题之外，美国打算把台湾变成美国在远东的空军和海军根据地。二月二十八日国民党发言人又承认了给美国船只在中国内河——长江的航行权。二月十三日路透社报导：王世杰在（蒋匪）“国民参政会”常驻会上声称：中国（蒋匪）支持美国恢复欧洲和日本的计划。南京报纸传出：二月十七日（蒋匪）行政院通过决议减轻对日本工业的限制。这是表示国民党为了换得美国援助，同意使中国的外交政策更加服从于美帝国主义的利益。
    美国的援华（蒋）新计划，表示美帝在华扩张的继续强化。可是美国的扩张是在新的情况中进行的，这种情况有利于民族解放力量，而不利于帝国主义侵略和国民党反动力量。杜鲁门致国会的咨文、国务院的备忘录和马歇尔的演说，都不得不承认国民党统治的破产，和美国干涉中国内政政策的破产。他们承认自日本投降以来已给国民党以巨大援助，其中且包括大量军事援助，这在国务院公布的备忘录中已详细暴露了。但是这种援助并不能保证国民党反动分子所需要的“暂时休息”。中国人民解放军正依靠全体人民的援助，不断增长自己的打击力量，他们决心继续自己的胜利，直到解放全中国领土。
