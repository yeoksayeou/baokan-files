Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th. Faced with the great offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the Yan bandit was panicked and at a loss. He recently carried out unprecedented large-scale destruction in the Pingchuan area of central Shanxi, attempting a final struggle. The Yan bandit troops in Wenshui and Fenyang forced the masses to block wells, confiscated and destroyed cooking pots, implemented village mergers to create no-man's-lands, and forced men aged fifteen to fifty-five in the countryside to live near the Yan bandit's city gate strongholds. The Yan bandits in Jiaocheng and Qingyuan have concentrated the wounded soldiers and their families in Taiyuan, and more than 200 carts have concentrated grain from Jiaocheng and Qingyuan to Taiyuan. At the same time, they are stepping up the conscription and "organization" of soldiers: In January of this year, the Yan bandit held a special commissioner meeting in Taiyuan, stipulating that 150,000 men should be conscripted before February 1, and 240,000 portions of land should be seized and merged before March 5 (calculated as the land cultivated by two farmers as one portion). The Yan bandit captured able-bodied men in the name of "training" and "meetings," as well as by armed encirclement of villages. Because the deadline has passed, most areas have not yet reached the designated numbers, so an emergency order has been issued: men aged fifteen to seventeen are organized into "youth teams," those aged eighteen to forty-seven are organized into "People's Defense Army," and those aged forty-eight to fifty-five are organized into "guard teams," to accelerate the organization and training, in an attempt to supplement the number of soldiers. The 240,000 portions of land forcibly seized by the Yan bandit completely deprived the people of central Shanxi of their land ownership and made it his private property. After seizing the land, it was stipulated that the people who cultivate the land must find joint guarantors, and those who cannot pay preferential grain and land tax will have their land confiscated and be sent to military service.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 17th. The Yan bandit troops in Fenyang robbed our border areas on the 9th, and committed the inhumane atrocity of setting fire to and suffocating more than 100 women and children in Jinzhuang Village, Ninth District of the county. At dawn that day, the Yan bandit troops surrounded the village. Women and children who had not escaped hid in a cave. The Yan bandit troops piled firewood at the entrance of the cave and set it on fire. From morning to noon, the fire and smoke continued, and more than 100 women and children were suffocated to death. Five of Fan Ruiheng's family of eight were suffocated to death, and all three members of Tang Xingyuan's family were suffocated to death. After the tragedy occurred, the Fenyang County Democratic Government immediately sent personnel to provide condolences and investigate the names of the chief culprits of the tragedy, in order to track them down and repay the blood debt.

　　晋中平川阎匪
  　竟用大破坏作最后挣扎
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】在人民解放军大进攻面前，阎贼惊惶失措，近在晋中平川地带施行空前未有之大破坏，妄图最后挣扎。文水、汾阳阎匪军，强迫群众堵塞水井，将做饭锅没收捣毁，并实行并村制造无人区，强迫乡下十五岁至五十五岁之男子，搬到阎匪城关附近据点居住。交城、清源阎匪已将伤兵及家眷向太原集中，并有二百余辆大车由交城、清源向太原集中粮食。与此同时更加紧抓丁“编组”：今年一月，阎贼在太原召开专员会议，规定于二月一日前抓丁十五万人，并于三月五日前抢并土地二十四万份（按以两农民耕作之地划为一份）。阎贼以“受训”“开会”等名义以及武装包围村庄捕捉壮丁。因期限已过，大部分地区还未达到指定数字，又下紧急命令：凡十五岁至十七岁的男子编为“壮年队”，十八岁到四十七岁的编为“民卫军”；四十八岁到五十五岁的编为“守护队”，加速编组训练，企图从中抓补兵额。阎匪强劫之二十四万份土地，是完全剥夺了晋中人民的土地所有权归其私有，圈地后又规定种地人民要找连环保，交不了优待粮及田赋的，即实行夺田并送服兵役。
    【新华社晋绥十七日电】汾阳阎匪军，九日出城向我边沿地区抢劫，在该县九区金庄村发生放火熏死妇孺百余名的灭绝人性的暴行。当日拂晓，阎匪军包围该村，未及逃出的妇女儿童，躲入一窑洞内，阎匪军即在窑口堆积柴草，纵火焚烧，自晨至午，火烟不绝，百余妇孺全被熏死。范瑞恒一家八口被熏死五口，唐兴元全家三口均被熏毙命。惨案发生后，我汾阳县民主政府立即派员进行抚恤慰问，并调查惨案之主犯姓名，以期追缉归案，偿还血债。
