　　Recollections and Self-Criticism
  　The Establishment of the New Farmers' Association in Shidong Village
    After eight days of mobilization and networking, the Shidong New Farmers' Association was established.
    Every farmer showed great enthusiasm for the New Farmers' Association. They had three major satisfactions with the New Farmers' Association: first, they elected people they trusted from the bottom of their hearts, and the respected elders of the village were all elected; second, the Farmers' Association Committee had representatives from poor peasants, new middle peasants, and old middle peasants; and third, Zhang Shoutang, a fair and honest Communist Party member with a straightforward heart, was elected as the chairman of the Farmers' Association, and he could truly serve everyone. The initial mobilization of this enthusiasm among the farmers of Shidong went through a winding path.
  　I. Without the Masses' Own Practical Experience, Their Awareness Cannot Be Awakened
    Although the mobilization work for the New Farmers' Association began in Shidong Village after the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League on the 29th of last month, we had an abstract concept of relying on the Poor Peasants' League and uniting with the middle peasants to establish the Farmers' Association. We did not enlighten the poor peasants from their own experience to realize that only by uniting with the middle peasants and establishing the Farmers' Association could their own liberation be guaranteed. Instead, we used empty slogans such as "Poor peasants uniting with middle peasants are powerful" and "Establishing a New Farmers' Association can implement democracy" to mobilize them. In practice, we did not completely believe that the Poor Peasants' Committee could handle everything well. We formulated a set of plans: first, the Poor Peasants' League小组 should submit a list of names and review everyone who wanted to participate, then assign Poor Peasants' League members to develop the membership, and then the poor and middle peasants would jointly hold a meeting to review… We were confident that this approach was "clearly targeted" and "practically feasible," but the results in practice hit snags. Upon further inspection, individual committee members were not very clear about what this work was all about, only knowing that introducing the New Farmers' Association required review and criticism, without knowing why the New Farmers' Association should be established. Poor Peasants' League members who were networking with middle peasants did not know what to say to them. Some of those who were being networked said at the first Farmers' Association 小组 meeting: "I don't know what benefits the New Farmers' Association has, nor do I know what is bad about it." After these weaknesses were exposed, we began to wake up a little. On the third day, we re-discussed and studied the New Farmers' Association in the Poor Peasants' Committee. And according to the central policy, we dispelled some of the closed-door thoughts of the poor peasant committee members towards the old middle peasants. In the evening, the poor peasant committee members actively led the poor peasant小组 to mobilize for the development of the New Farmers' Association, so that every poor peasant团员 understood why the New Farmers' Association should be established? Why should poor peasants unite with middle peasants? That evening, a village-wide meeting of middle peasants was also held, specifically explaining the policy towards middle peasants, stating that the equal distribution was basically realized, and only the fruit excessively obtained by the cadres would be extracted to make up for the deficit. If it was still not enough, the extraction would be individual, and explaining our determination to implement democracy in rectifying the party and resolving cadre issues. This touched the hearts of the middle peasants. One middle peasant said: "I originally thought that after the Poor Peasants' League was established, we would be abandoned, and we were a little unconvinced. Now that you say that, I understand." Other middle peasants who attended the meeting also expressed: "If that's the case, I am willing to correct my shortcomings and join the New Farmers' Association." After such public mobilization, individual mobilization, general meetings, and small group meetings, the resentment between middle and poor peasants was cleared up. On the evening of the fourth, the poor peasant committee members and Farmers' Association 小组 leaders jointly led a meeting to review the members of the New Farmers' Association, which was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Every new member of the Farmers' Association voluntarily and actively conducted self-criticism, revealing their main problems. Poor Peasants' League members also actively provided caring opinions. An atmosphere of harmony and unity filled the air between the middle and poor peasants.
    Looking back at this section now, although specific mobilization was carried out to remedy the shortcomings, from the perspective of the entire work process, too much time was still spent on review, criticism, and self-criticism (a total of three review meetings were held). The idea that "poor peasants are the bones, and middle peasants are the flesh" and "unity between middle and poor peasants can lead to mastery" was not mobilized deeply enough.
  　II. Organizing the Masses by Satisfying Their Urgent Demands
    At the beginning of preparing for the New Farmers' Association, we did not clearly research, nor did we consciously research, what were the most urgent demands of the masses in Shidong? Then, from this basic point of the masses, mobilize the masses to establish the New Farmers' Association. Therefore, in the first few days, although we carried out the mobilization of the New Farmers' Association, some of the mobilized people always nodded "Yes! Yes!" when the New Farmers' Association was mentioned, but everyone's emotions were also gloomy. Later, with the help of superiors and further investigation and research, we discovered: 1. Among the members of the Poor Peasants' League, many people had already been satisfied with their liberation, and some people had been liberated excessively, and the scope that needed to be filled was already relatively small. Therefore, their main demand was democracy (demanding to vent the oppression they had suffered from some bad cadres in the past, demanding to settle the struggle fruits that were unfairly distributed in the past). When each poor peasant 小组 proposed to raise opinions to the party member cadres on the evening of the fourth, the entire venue scrambled to speak. Xiang Fuzi, who was ill, angrily placed his torn waistband in front of everyone and said: "This also cost three thousand yuan. Everyone judge whether it is reasonable or not?" The atmosphere in the entire venue immediately caused a sensation. 2. On the middle peasant side, because the organization of the Poor Peasants' League and the time after the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League was too long, and the work for the middle peasants was done very poorly, they developed many doubts and concerns. They did not know what the Poor Peasants' League was doing? They thought that the poor and hired laborers were in charge, and they would be cadres. They also did not know how the land would be extracted and compensated, and they were very depressed. Although twenty-five middle peasant representatives were invited to participate in the Poor Peasants' League establishment meeting, it did not solve the problem of unity between middle and poor peasants. At the village-wide middle peasant conference on the fourth, they listened to Chairman Mao's policy towards middle peasants, and everyone spoke extremely enthusiastically. They said: "As long as we first extract the fruits excessively obtained by cadres and activists, we will definitely help make up for the remaining deficit." Dissatisfaction with bad cadres, demands for democracy, and demands for the settlement of fruits also formed the most important demands among the middle peasants.
    According to the consistent and urgent demands of the middle and poor peasants, a joint conference of middle and poor peasants was convened on the fifth, to fully express their opinions to party member cadres. Many things that were not known in the past were told one by one. Some people cried, and the sufferings of the middle and poor peasants were linked together. More than 20 people who had not finished expressing their opinions volunteered to go to the branch to raise their opinions. On the basis of the rising emotions of the middle and poor peasants, the mobilization to establish the New Farmers' Association was carried out, explaining that the establishment of the New Farmers' Association was to satisfy everyone's democratic demands, and to immediately settle the village's fruit accounts. That evening, the number of people introduced to join the Farmers' Association by the poor peasant小组 was more than the previous two times. The number of members of the New Farmers' Association had now increased to more than 170, and the prestige of the New Farmers' Association in the village had greatly increased. People who had not temporarily joined the Farmers' Association were looking everywhere for poor peasant committee members and Poor Peasants' League members, asking to be introduced to join the Farmers' Association. A middle peasant with shortcomings expressed to a Poor Peasants' League member: "I have shortcomings, I will self-criticize, and I will withdraw the excessively occupied fruits. Please introduce me to join the Farmers' Association." On the day the New Farmers' Association was established, some people who had not participated rushed to the venue, demanding to "register their names" and join the New Farmers' Association.
    The urgent demand for democracy united the middle and poor peasants under the banner of the Farmers' Association. In this process, we neglected to simultaneously grasp a problem: we did not, in the midst of the rising emotions of the middle and poor peasants demanding democracy, further conduct education on the relationship between the poor peasants as the bones, the leadership, and the locomotive, and the middle peasants as the flesh, according to the different political and economic status of the middle and poor peasants, in order to improve the leading position of the poor peasants in the New Farmers' Association. This still needs to be compensated for in future movements.
  　III. Opposing Clique-ism in Work
    Some of our comrades, after arriving in Shidong, had a set of ideal cliques in their minds. This clique was the work experience of Zhao Zhuang plus their own ideal set of work methods. They wanted to do it step by step in a meticulous manner. After arriving in the village, they emphasized understanding the situation, which was completely correct, but this understanding of the situation was not from the movement. For example, at that time, the work of reviewing the members of the Poor Peasants' League was underway, but we did not specifically and meticulously understand the situation of the poor peasant class from this movement. Later, when developing the New Farmers' Association, the central link was to unite the middle peasants, but we did not understand the situation and ideological trends of the middle peasant class in this movement. On the contrary, we were enthusiastic about static investigations outside the movement. This investigation was divorced from the actual movement, so the materials investigated in the two stages did not play a greater beneficial role in promoting the movement.
    At the beginning of the preparation for the New Farmers' Association, we did not understand what the most urgent demands of the masses were? But we had a set of step-by-step cliques in our minds, mechanically transporting the experience of other places, spending all day on reviewing the members of the Farmers' Association. In form, it showed unusual busyness, but in reality, the minds of the masses were not here. These few days of step-by-step criticism and self-criticism only became a form divorced from the masses. This clique-style working method that did not conform to the actual situation of the masses made us lag behind the masses, delaying the movement in the village for a few days.
    The production season has arrived, and the agricultural activities of the farmers are gradually tightening up. We did not conduct a specific investigation and research on this situation, and we believed that we could no longer delay during the day, and we could only use the evening time. This idea objectively dragged down the work, without understanding the most urgent demands of the masses at present. They were not afraid of delaying a few days of work (because before the second day of February, agricultural activities were limited to sending manure and building weirs). What they hoped most was to solve the problems in the village as soon as possible, so that everyone could carry out production with peace of mind. Our dragging again shows that our thinking is lagging behind the masses.

### 回忆与检讨　石洞村成立新农会的经过

　　回忆与检讨
  　石洞村成立新农会的经过
    经过八天的动员串连，石洞新农会成立了。
    每个农民，对新农会都表现出非常亲热。他们对新农会有三大满意：一是选上了自己心眼里的人，村上老气人都当选了；二是农会委员会中，贫农、新中农、老中农都选有自己的代表；三是为人公正，心肝直直的共产党员张守堂被选成了农会主席，他能真正替大家办事。石洞农民这股热劲的初步发动，是经历了一段弯弯曲曲的路程。
  　一、没有经过群众切身经验，不能启发群众觉悟
    虽然在上月二十九日贫农团成立之后，石洞村就开始了新农会的发动工作，但我们有一个抽象的依靠贫农团、团结中农成立农会的概念，我们不是启发贫农从自己经验里，认识只有团结了中农，成立了农会，才能使自己的翻身得到保证；而是空洞的说：“贫农团结中农力量大”，“成立了新农会才能实行民主”去动员。在作法上又不完全相信贫农委员会能把一切事情办好；自己订了一套计划：先由贫农团小组提名单，把每一个要参加的人审查一遍，而后分配贫农团员去发展，而后贫中农共同开会审查……。我们满以为这样的作法“目标明确”，“作法具体”；但做的结果，在实际中碰了钉子。再一检查，个别委员还不很清楚这回工作到底是怎么一回事情，只知道介绍新农会要审查，要批评，不知道为啥要成立新农会；串连中农的贫农团员，也不知道该向人家说些啥，一些被串连的人，在第一次农会小组上说：我不知道新农会有啥好处，也不知道有啥赖处。这些弱点暴露后，我们开始清醒了一些。第三天才重新把新农会的事情，在贫农委员会进行讨论研究。并根据中央的政策解开了一些贫农委员中对老中农的关门思想。晚上各贫农委员就积极的领导各贫农小组进行发展新农会的动员，使每个贫农团员都明白为什么要成立新农会？贫农为啥要联合中农？当晚又同时召开了全村中农会议，专门讲解了对待中农的政策，说明平分大体实现，只将干部多得果实抽出来补窟窿，如果还不够，抽动也是个别的，并说明我们整党与解决干部问题实行民主的决心，这一来说到中农的心眼里了，一个中农表示：“原来以为成立了贫农团，不要咱们了，咱们就有些不服气，这一说就想通了。”其他参加会议的中农也均纷纷表示：“要是这样，我愿意改正缺点参加新农会。”经过这样公开动员，个别动员，大会讨论，小会讨论，中贫农的气打通了。四号晚上，贫农委员与农会小组长共同领导，审查新农会会员的会议进行得空前热烈，每个新参加的农会会员，都自动积极的进行检讨，把自己主要的毛病都说了出来，贫农团员也积极提供了爱护意见，中贫农之间，充满着融洽团结的空气。
    从现在再来回头看这一段，虽然经过具体动员，补救了缺点，但从整个工作的进行上说，还是把较多的时间用在审查、批评与自我批评上（共开了三次审查会），“贫农是骨，中农是肉”，“中贫农团结才能当家”的思想，动员得还不深入。
  　二、从满足群众的迫切要求中组织群众
    当筹备新农会之初，我们没有明确研究出，也没有有意识的去研究，石洞群众眼前最迫切的要求是什么？然后从这一群众基本点出发，去发动群众，成立新农会。因此开始几天，我们虽然进行了新农会的动员，但一部分被动员过的人，一提到新农会虽然总是点头“是！是！”，大家的情绪，也是阴沉沉的。以后经过上级的帮助和进一步的调查研究，才发现了：一、贫农团团员中，有不少的人翻身已经满足，一部分人翻身已经过高，需要填补的，已是一个较小的范围。因此他们最主要的是民主要求（要求发泄过去一些坏干部对他们的欺压，要求清算过去分配不公的斗争果实），当四号晚上各贫农小组提出向党员干部提意见时，全场争相发言，生着病的祥福子气得把破腰带摆在大家面前说：“这也花费了三千元，大家评一评合理不合理？”全场情绪立即轰动。二、在中农方面，由于组织贫农团以及贫农团成立以后，时间拖的过长，对中农工作做得很差，他们滋生了许多怀疑和顾虑。他们不知道贫农团是干啥的？以为贫雇当家就是贫雇当干部，他们也闹不清土地到底是如何抽补法，心里非常苦闷，虽然在贫农团成立大会上，曾邀请了二十五位中农代表参加，但并未解决中贫农的团结问题，四号的全村中农大会上，他们听了毛主席对待中农的政策，每个人发言都极为热烈，他们说：“只要先抽干部积极分子多得的果实，余下的窟窿，我们一定帮助补。”不满意坏干部，要求民主，要求清算果实，在中农里也形成了最主要的要求。
    根据中贫农一致而迫切的要求，五日全村召开了中贫农联合大会，尽情的向党员干部提意见，好多件过去不知道的事情，都一一诉出来了，有的人哭了，中贫农的苦，连结在一起。廿多位没有提完意见的人，便自报奋勇到支部里去提，在中贫农高涨的情绪基础上，进行了成立新农会的动员，说明成立新农会就是要满足大家的民主要求，并马上清算村里的果实帐目。当天晚上，贫农小组介绍入农会的人，比前两次都多，新农会会员这时已增至百七十余人，新农会在村里的威信大为提高，暂时没有参加农会的人，都到处找贫农委员、贫农团员，要求介绍入农会。一位有缺点的中农向贫农团员表示说：我有缺点我检讨，多占果实我退出，请你介绍我参加农会吧。新农会成立那天，一部分没有参加的人，都涌到会场，要求“记个名”，参加新农会。
    民主的迫切要求，使中贫农在农会的旗帜下团结起来。在这当中我们忽略了同时抓紧一个问题：我们没有在中贫农要求民主的高涨情绪下，再根据中贫农所处的不同政治经济地位，进一步进行贫农是骨、是领导、是火车头，中农是肉的关系教育，以提高贫农在新农会中的领导地位，这还须要在今后运动中来补偿。
  　三、反对工作中的圈圈主义
    我们中间有部分同志来到石洞后，脑子里就有了一套理想的圈圈，这个圈圈是赵庄的工作经验加上自己理想的一套工作方法。要按步就班的细致的来作。到村后强调了解情况，这是完全对的，但这种了解情况，并不是从运动中去了解。比如当时正进行审查贫农团员的工作，我们并未从这一运动中去具体细致的了解贫农层的情况，以后发展新农会时，中心环节在于团结中农，我们又未在这一运动中，去了解中农层的情况和思想动向，相反，却热心于运动以外的静止调查，这种调查既和实际运动相脱节，因此两个阶段中所调查的材料，都没有对运动的推进起着更大的有益的作用。
    在新农会筹备之初，我们不了解群众最迫切的要求是什么？但我们脑子里却有一套按步就班的圈圈，机械搬运了旁的地方的经验，整天把时间花费在审查农会会员上，形式上表现出异常忙碌，实际上群众的心思却不在这里，这几天的按步就班的批评与自我批评，只是成了一种脱离群众的形式。这种不切合群众实际的圈圈工作方法，就使我们落在群众的后面，把村里的运动迟滞了几天。
    生产季节到来了，农民的农事活动逐渐紧起来了。我们对这一情况，也没有作具体调查研究，就认为白天再也不能耽误了，只有利用晚上这个时间吧。这种想法，客观上便自流的把工作拖拉了下来，而不了解目前群众最迫切的要求，倒不是怕误几天工，（因二月二以前，农事活动还只限于送粪垒堰）他们最希望的，倒是赶快把村里的问题早日解决，每个人都好安心进行生产。我们的拖拉，又再一次说明我们思想的落后于群众。
