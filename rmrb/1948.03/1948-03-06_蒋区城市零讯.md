　　Scattered News from Cities in the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
　　▲ During the second economic storm in Shanghai this year, a newspaper advertisement read: "Selling 'labels that are easy to rewrite the price on.'" It said: "Prices rise every day, rewriting is troublesome. This label can be erased and rewritten at will, and will never fade." (United Press Shanghai dispatch)
　　▲ During the first economic storm in Shanghai this year, in early January, the worst meal in a restaurant cost 18,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency, and only two bowls of rice were provided. Laborers need to eat at least ten bowls; a ladle of boiled water cost 2,000 yuan. The poor all said: "We can't live anymore!"
　　▲ Prices in Tianjin are soaring, and theft is increasing daily. According to the city's local court, it handled more than 2,300 theft cases last year, accounting for almost six-tenths of all criminal cases.
　　▲ The chairman of the Hankou Chamber of Commerce said: Large and small shops in the city have to bear more than thirty kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies every month.
　　▲ The price of rice in Chengdu rose to 1.861 million Chiang Kai-shek currency per double market dan (a unit of weight) on January 4th. On this day, the poor again launched rice-grabbing and "eating the rich" movements everywhere, many of whom were women.
　　▲ In Luxian County, Sichuan, peddlers buy Chiang Kai-shek small bills below 100 yuan according to weight, paying 2,000 yuan per catty, while old newspapers from Nanjing still sell for 6,000 yuan per catty. (Associated Press Nanjing dispatch, February 29)
　　▲ In Neijiang, Sichuan, grain prices have been soaring recently. The poor often sell their children. A month ago, a young woman carried a two-year-old boy with a straw circle inserted in his head, crying and selling him along the street, priced at 2 million yuan.
