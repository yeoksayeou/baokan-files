Answers to Several Questions in the Land Redistribution Campaign

Where to Register and Where to Distribute Land
To the Editor:
    Our village currently has two issues, and we request your newspaper to provide an explanation.
    (1) Wang Haishen, a middle peasant from Nanhe Dongguan, has a family of four (his father, his wife, his younger brother, and his brother's wife). He has been doing business in Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, for many years. In 1937, he married another wife in Jiaocheng and has a daughter with her. They have a good relationship, while his relationship with his wife at home is very poor. When his mother passed away a few years ago, he returned once and said, "As long as she (referring to his wife at home) is at home, I will never return home." He left and has never returned since. Now that land reform is underway, his wife is requesting to divide his share of the harvest, but the cadres are hesitant to respond directly. Many similar cases exist in our village. How should this be handled? What is the status of this woman (in her thirties, without children) at home? Should she be allocated a share of land and harvest?
    (2) Yan Guangxiu, originally from Shayang Village, Jize County, is a poor peasant. He has a wife and son at his original home. He used to do business in Nanhe city for many years. During that time, he had a relationship with a woman surnamed Yin from our village, later married her, and had several children. Later, due to business failure, he made a living by peddling paste in our village, and his life is very difficult. After liberation, he stated that he would register in our village and not return to his original home. Previously, the cadres had taken care of him as a very poor peasant. Now, the masses are suggesting that he should return to his original home. Is this reasonable?

    East Gou Village Poor Peasant Representative Wang Tongxi
Comrade Tongxi:
    (1) The woman you mentioned whose husband has been doing business away from home for many years and has married another wife and had children has effectively been abandoned. Since she still lives in your village, she should be given a share of land and property. Her husband has already registered elsewhere, so the village should no longer allocate a share of land to him.
    (2) Since Yan Guangxiu has already registered in your village and has been taken care of in the past campaigns, if your village's land is not too scarce and he does not voluntarily want to return to his original home, then he should not be forced to return. However, the village association in his original home should be notified to no longer count him as a member.

Where Should Divorced Women Be Allocated Land?
To the Editor:
    I have read the land Q&A, and there is one question that is not addressed. That is, before the land is evenly distributed, if a woman divorces her husband and has not found another partner, when the land is divided equally, the land law stipulates that men, women, old, and young all have a share. From where should this land be allocated to this woman who has not found a partner? I think it should be allocated from her mother's village, but the land law does not stipulate this, and I am afraid her mother's village will not agree. Is it right to allocate it from her mother's village?

    Wu Zhengang
Comrade Zhengang:
    Regarding your question about where to allocate the land to a woman who has divorced her husband and has not found another partner when the land is divided equally. If this woman has completely separated from her original husband and returned to live with her family, she should be allocated a share of land in her mother's village. If she finds another partner in the future, she will still handle this share of land herself. If the village does not agree, it should be properly explained. She was originally a daughter of the village. Now that she has divorced her husband and returned to her family, she should still be considered a member of the village and given a share of land. If she still lives in her husband's family, then her husband's village should take care of her.

Do Not Restrict the Masses from Going Out to Gather Firewood Due to Land Redistribution
To the Editor:
    In the Northwest Chongyi base point of Wu'an Eight District, there are a total of six villages of varying sizes. Generally, poor and hired peasants rely on going out to mend pots for a living. Since the new year, many poor and hired peasants have requested to go out to mend pots, but now is the land redistribution period. We are afraid that if the poor peasants leave, their needs cannot be met during the land redistribution. However, the general poor peasants only realize that they can earn money by going out, but they do not realize how much benefit land redistribution can bring to them. Our district has repeatedly explained that they should wait for the land redistribution before going out to gather firewood, but the poor peasants do not listen. Is it okay for them to go out? Please answer.

    Jin Guangshan
Comrade Guangshan:
    Regarding your statement that some poor and hired peasants make a living by mending pots and urgently need to go out, we believe that this can be allowed. As for conducting land redistribution, the pros and cons should be explained to the masses. It is best to participate in the movement at home. If they urgently need to make a living and cannot stay at home, they should not be forced. During the village's land redistribution, as long as it is truly handled fairly and reasonably according to the spirit of the policy, it will not be a major problem if individual poor peasants are not at home to gather firewood.

### 抽补中几个问题的解答

    抽补中几个问题的解答
　　在哪下户在哪分地编辑同志：
    本村今有两种问题，请贵报解释一下。
    （一）南和东关中农王海申全家现有人四口（其父与其妻其弟与弟妻），他在山西交城县经商多年，于二十六年在交城另娶一妻并有一女儿，感情很好，与他在家之妻很不和睦，前几年他母亲去世时，他回来一趟，并言她（指他在家妻）在家一天，我至死不回家，他走后至今永没回来过，现在正进行土地改革，他妻并要求与他男人分果实，干部也不敢直接答复。本村象此事很多，该怎样办？这个女人（三十多岁，并无子女）在家算个什么人？该分一份土地果实否？
    （二）本村又一贫民阎光修原籍鸡泽县沙阳村人，家中并有妻子儿子，他前在南和城内经商多年，在经商时与本村尹姓之女人发生关系，后又结婚，并生子女数人，后因生意倒闭，就在我村跑挑糊口，生活也很困难。解放后他说在我村下户，不回原籍，先前干部按赤贫照顾过，至今群众反应叫他返回原籍，也不知合理不合理？
　　东沟贫民代表王同喜同喜同志：
    （一）你信上说的这个女人的丈夫出外经商多年，已经另外娶妻生子，实际上已遗弃了这个妇女，她既然仍然在你村里生活就应给予她一份土地财产。她男人已经在外下户，村中可不再给他一份土地。
    （二）阎光修既已在你村下户，过去运动中也已照顾过他，这次运动中，假若你村的土地不是太缺，而其本人又不自愿的话，则不应一定要他返回原籍。但应通知其原籍农会，不再计算他本人人口。
  　　　　　　　编者
    已离婚妇女在哪里分地？编辑同志：
    我看了土地问答，有一个问题，问答上没有，就是土地未平分前，妇女与男人离了婚，也没有找上对象，就要平分土地。土地法规定男女老少都有一份，象这未找上对象的妇女那一份土地从哪分？我想到得从她娘家村庄分一份才对，但是土地法未规定，恐怕她娘家的村庄闹不通，怎办？在她娘家分一份对不对？  　　　　
  　武振纲振纲同志：
    你所问妇女与男人离了婚，还没有找上对象，平分土地时她这一份应从哪分。假使这妇女已和她原来男人完全脱离关系，而回到娘家生活的话，应该在娘家村庄分一份土地，以后再找对象时这一份土地仍同样由她自己处理。村上闹不通应该好好解释，她原就是村里的闺女，现在和丈夫离了婚回娘家，就该仍算她是村里一个人而分给一份土地。如果仍住在婆家，则应由婆家村庄照顾。
  　　　　　　　　编者
　　不要因等抽补限制群众出外拾砍编者同志：
    武安八区西北崇义基点，共计大小六个村子，一般贫雇多仗出外补锅生活，过年以来，有多数贫雇要求出外补锅，但是现在抽补时期，恐怕贫雇出去以后，抽补时不能满足要求，但是一般贫雇只认识到出去就能赚钱，但没认识到抽补对自己有多大好处。敝区亦再三解释等待抽补后再去拾砍，贫雇概不听信，这个事情是否可以出去？请答。
  　靳广善广善同志：
    你所说的一些贫雇以补锅为生，急须出去，我们认为是可以允许的。至于进行抽补，应向群众说明利害关系，最好在家参加运动，如果他糊口要紧，一定不能在家，也不能勉强。村中抽补时，只要真正依照政策精神，处理公平合理，个别贫雇拾砍不在家，也无大妨碍。
