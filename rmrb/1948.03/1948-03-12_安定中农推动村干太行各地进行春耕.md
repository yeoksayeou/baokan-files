　　【Taihang News】“After the leap month year, ride a horse and plant the fields,” In Taihang's Huguan, Shexian, Licheng, Pingshun, Linxian, Zuoquan, Neiqiu and other counties, after in-depth publicity of the Land Law and specific explanations of policies towards middle peasants, middle and poor peasants have gradually eliminated fears of equal distribution and waiting for equal distribution. Many villages have begun to actively shift to spring plowing and large-scale production. Some districts and villages in Pingshun have already held meetings to inspect and promote spring plowing. A few days ago, the district and village cadre meetings in the fourth district specifically discussed the common fear of being criticized and the "waiting to get through" mentality among cadres. Zhang Shuangyu from Yongtou Village said: "I am also afraid of equal distribution. I didn't apply manure to my good land, I put all the manure on the bad land. I was always thinking about when I would 'get through,' so I didn't have the heart to lead production well." After reflection and self-criticism, everyone, in addition to studying the Land Law, felt that they had not done a good job in the past. Now, they felt they could no longer "lie down." Based on everyone's opinions, the leadership immediately pointed out: "As long as you recognize your past mistakes, are determined to correct them, and do a good job in the current work, the masses will still support you." This dispelled some of the "no future" and fear of equal distribution mentality among the village cadres, and the enthusiasm for leading production was raised. In Licheng, Zuoquan and other places, the Land Law was repeatedly explained through the middle and poor peasant associations, reassuring the middle peasants. Some middle peasants in Wulihou, Zuoquan, said: "If I had known earlier that the land would not be greatly affected, I would have worked hard a long time ago. Spring is early this year, and a step late will be troublesome!" Therefore, everyone automatically reorganized the mutual aid groups that day and actively carried out manure delivery and land repair. Lian Qinghe, a middle peasant in Lianjiapo, Linxian, and Guo Chang, a liberated peasant in Liukang Village, did not understand the Land Law. When they heard that it was going to be distributed equally, they did not take care of their livestock. Lian Qinghe said: "Anyway, it's not ours anymore, whoever wants to borrow it can borrow it. If it dies, we can still eat the meat." Guo Chang said: "We can't feed the livestock well, let it become a skeleton, maybe we can keep it." Recently, in the in-depth explanation of the Land Law, he learned that the middle peasants' movable property would not be touched, so he started feeding them well again and stepped up the manure delivery work. Because Tuichi Village in Jixian did not understand the Land Law before, they wasted a lot of things; now that they have clarified the Land Law, the whole village is in high spirits for production. Guo Jinsheng, a labor hero (new middle peasant) in Shihe, Shexian, used his experience from last year to promote spring plowing in the whole village. From the explanation of the Land Law and the widespread promotion of the idea of getting rich through hard work, everyone's production enthusiasm has become even higher than before. After the masses in Shentou Village studied the Land Law in depth around the Lantern Festival, they were particularly energetic. Hou Sanhai, a new middle peasant, said: "I didn't know how to divide it equally before, but now I understand that the middle peasants are not touched, and working hard is ours. Drawing from the rich to supplement the poor is also to help us all stand up and get rich. Now I can rest assured." After transporting manure before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, Qiushuyuan in Licheng began to repair the land and plow the stubble land. Now they have cultivated twelve mu of flower land. While speeding up manure delivery, Panjun Village in Pingshun proposed "Fill in the gaps without regard to season, nurture and plant according to the season, we can't be a step late." Therefore, after they had delivered most of the manure, they proposed a plan to open up one mu of wasteland per person to increase production. The masses in Lichang Village, District One, Zuoquan, have recently been also beating the smoked soil to increase fertilizer. With the improvement of everyone's production enthusiasm, some places are buying livestock to increase animal power. From the first month to now, Shishao Village in Shexian has bought back four donkeys and six cattle. In order to solve the problem of agricultural tools in everyone's production, the cooperative in Guozhuang Village has organized a blacksmith's furnace to speed up the repair and manufacture of agricultural tools, and is purchasing various seeds to help poor hired laborers and newly liberated households solve their difficulties. Encouraged by the Land Law, many women have also participated in spring plowing activities. The women in Shipo Village, Huguan, are also carrying manure and repairing the land like men. They happily said: "Now we are truly equal to men, and we will have a share when the land is distributed in the future." Their enthusiasm for production and weaving is greater than before.

　　安定中农推动村干太行各地进行春耕
    【太行消息】“过了闰月年，走马就种田”，太行壶关、涉县、黎城、平顺、林县、左权、内邱等县，经过先后深入宣传土地法和具体的解释对中农的政策，中贫农已逐渐在消除怕平分和等待平分的想法，许多村庄已开始积极的转向了春耕大生产。平顺的一些区村，已开了检查与推动春耕的会议。前几天，四区的区村干部会议上，并针对干部中普遍存在的怕挨斗和“等过关”的思想作了专门讨论。涌头村张双玉说：我也怕平分，我的好地就没有送粪，我都把粪送到坏地了，自己老想着啥时“过了关”才好，所以就没心事好好领导生产。经过反省检讨，大家除对土地法加以研究外，都觉得以前工作没作好，现在自己可不能再“躺下去”了，领导上根据大家意见，当即指出：只要认识以前错误，决心改正，把当前工作搞好，群众还会拥护你的。这样把村干部中存在的“没下场”和怕平分的思想才打消了些，对生产领导的积极性才提起来。在黎城左权等地，经过中贫农会，反复的解释土地法，使中农安心。左权五里堠有的中农就这样说：“我要早知道土地不大动我早就干红了，今年春浅，迟一步就累事啦！”于是，大家当天便自动的整顿了互助组，积极的进行送粪修地。林县连家坡中农连青合与六康村翻身农民郭长，不了解土地法，听说要平分，就不爱护他的牲口，连青合说：“反正不是咱的了，谁借就借给他使吧，使死了还能吃肉。”郭长说：“可不能好好喂牲口，叫他瘦成了骨架，还可能给咱留下。”最近在深入解释土地法中，他知道了中农浮财不动后，才又好好的喂起来，加紧了送粪工作。汲县土池村因为以前不了解土地法，便浪费了不少东西；现弄清楚土地法后，全村生产情绪高涨。涉县石河沭劳动英雄（新中农）郭进生，他以去年的经验推动了全村春耕。从解释土地法普遍宣传发家致富的思想中，大家的生产情绪比以前更高涨起来。神头村群众在元宵前后大家深入研究了土地法后，劲头特别大，新中农侯三孩说：“我以前不知道怎个平分，现在我可明白了，中农不动，劳动下就是咱的，抽补也是为了让咱大家翻身发家，我这一下心可拿定了。”黎城秋树垣在正月十五前运完粪后，便展开了修地和垡茬地的工作，现已耕完了十二亩花地。平顺畔峻村在加紧送粪中便提出了“填平补齐没节令，养种有节令，可不能迟一步”，所以在他们把大部粪送完后，便又提出了一人开春荒一亩以增加生产的计划。左权一区里长村群众最近并在打薰土，增加肥料。在大家生产情绪的提高下，有的地方正在购卖牲口增加畜力。涉县史邵村从正月到今已买回驴四头、牛六头。郭庄村的合作社为解决大家生产中的农具困难，已组织了一盘铁匠炉，加紧修制农具，并在购买各种种子帮助贫雇及新翻身户解决困难。在土地法的鼓舞下，有许多妇女也参加了春耕活动。壶关石坡村的妇女们也在和男人一样担粪修地，她们高兴的说：“现在咱可是要和男人真正平等了，将来分地也有俺们一份。”她们生产纺织的劲头比以前更大。
