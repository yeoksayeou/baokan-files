Ping Shun County is working hard on spring plowing. Now the whole county has almost finished delivering manure and soil, and is repairing the edges and building embankments to prepare for burning firewood. After reading the Border Region Government's proclamation that "whoever sows, reaps," Beiliu Village in Licheng County wants to ensure that all people and livestock in the village are busy, and both middle and poor peasants are very motivated in production. Our village should learn from them and speed up production as well. The Border Region Government's proclamation clearly states that regardless of when you make up the difference, you still get to reap what you sow, so everyone can rest assured and focus on good production. This year the spring is early, and there is plenty of spring rain. Get started early, and you'll benefit yourself!

    早点下手！
    平顺春耕抓的紧，现在全县粪土已经快送完了，正在修边垒堰准备烧柴。黎城北流村念了边府谁种谁收的布告，要做到全村人和牲口都不闲，中农贫农生产都很有劲。咱们村应向他们学习，把生产也赶紧一点。边府布告上说的很明白，不管早晚抽补，你种下还是你收，大家都可安心好好生产。今年春浅，春雨也足，早点下手，自己沾光！
