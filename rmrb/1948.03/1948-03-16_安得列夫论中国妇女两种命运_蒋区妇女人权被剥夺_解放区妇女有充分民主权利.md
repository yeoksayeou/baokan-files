Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—Moscow Radio broadcast on International Women’s Day, March 8th, a commentary by Andreyev on the different fates of Chinese women in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas and the liberated areas, stating:

Women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and women in the Chinese liberated areas are commemorating International Women’s Day – "March 8th" – under completely different conditions. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, women do not have any basic human or political rights. The Kuomintang reactionaries have destroyed all cultural and social progressive organizations for Chinese women. Tens of thousands of Chinese women, female students, female workers, female teachers, female writers, female scientists, and female artists have been arrested and even murdered. The Kuomintang reactionaries are taking all possible measures to prevent Chinese women's groups from contacting other democratic women's groups in various countries. They refused to allow Chinese women representatives to attend the New York International Women's Conference. The only women's organization that the Kuomintang authorities allow to exist is the so-called Women's New Life Movement, which is led by the wives of Kuomintang authorities. Kuomintang reactionaries not only fail to protect the honor and dignity of Chinese women, but also condone Kuomintang army officers and soldiers raping women, and glorify incidents of Chinese women being raped by American beasts. Many cases of women being raped happen every day in the Kuomintang areas. When American soldiers raped female students in Beiping, patriotic people rose up to oppose the atrocities of the American military and demanded that the American military withdraw from China. The Kuomintang then ordered its secret agents to suppress them. Ninety percent of women in the Kuomintang areas are completely illiterate. Female workers suffer cruel oppression. They work twelve to fourteen hours a day, and their wages are not enough to maintain a life free of hunger. Many young women commit suicide because they cannot find a way out. Women's corpses are often found in the Huangpu River and elsewhere in Shanghai.

In the Chinese liberated areas, the living conditions of working women are completely different. Women have not only obtained all democratic and free rights, but also have material guarantees to enjoy these freedoms. The democratic government has eliminated unemployment, which is the terrible suffering of millions of women in the Kuomintang areas. The democratic government gathers millions of women to participate in production, serve in state organs, cooperatives, and social institutions, and share leadership work equally with men. The democratic government has organized special training schools for women. Women have the same right as men to take sick leave, and they continue to receive wages during the leave period, and their job positions are guaranteed during the illness, and they can receive free treatment. The democratic government in the liberated areas is particularly concerned about mothers and children, with one month of leave before and after childbirth, and guarantees to pay them wages. Mothers raising children can receive funds to protect the health of mothers and children at any time. Nurseries and kindergartens have been established in enterprises and institutions to free up women's time to participate in political life and production work. Primary schools, night schools, and literacy classes are widely available in towns and villages in the liberated areas, and women can freely participate in these schools to receive education. The democratic rights enjoyed by women in the liberated areas are achieved by the Chinese people in a long and brutal struggle. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are now carrying out a war of liberation against the Kuomintang reactionaries and against American imperialist aggression. Millions of women are joining their husbands and brothers in this heroic struggle for democratic freedom and independence.

　　安得列夫论中国妇女两种命运
  　蒋区妇女人权被剥夺           
    解放区妇女有充分民主权利
    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科电台于三八节日广播安得列夫关于中国妇女在蒋匪统治区和在解放区两种不同命运的评论称：
    国民党统治区的妇女和中国解放区妇女是在完全不同的条件中纪念国际妇女节——“三八”节的。在国民党统治区域，妇女没有任何起码的人权和政治权利。国民党反动派摧毁了中国妇女一切文化社会进步组织，成千上万的中国妇女、女学生、女工、女教师、女文学家、女科学家、女艺术家等，都被逮捕甚至屠杀了。国民党反动派采取一切方法阻碍中国妇女团体和其他各国民主妇女团体发生联系，他们拒绝让中国妇女代表出席纽约国际妇女代表会议。国民党当局允准存在的唯一妇女组织是由国民党当局妻室领导的所谓妇女新运会。国民党反动分子不仅不保护中国女子的荣誉和人格，而且放纵国民党军队的官兵去强奸妇女，并歌颂中国女子遭受美国野兽强奸的事件，在国民党区域每天都发生许多女子被强奸的事。当北平发生美军强奸女学生时，爱国人士起来反对美军暴行，要求美军退出中国，国民党就命令其特务横加镇压。在国民党区域内百分之九十的妇女是完全不识字的。女工遭受着残酷的压迫，她们每天作十二至十四小时的工，所得工资不能维持饥饿的生活，许多青年女子因找不到出路而自杀，在上海的黄浦江和其他地方常常发现女人的尸首。
    在中国解放区内，劳动妇女的生活条件却完全不同，妇女不仅获得了一切民主自由权利，而且得到了享受这些自由的物质保证。民主政府消除了失业，而失业正是国民党区域内成百万妇女的可怕的痛苦。民主政府集结成百万妇女参加生产，到国家机关、合作社和社会机构里服务，和男子平等担负领导工作。民主政府为妇女组织了专门训练学校，妇女和男子一样有权利因病休假，并在休假期间照常领取工资，在患病期间保证其工作位置，并可免费治疗。解放区的民主政府对母亲和儿童特别关怀，生产前后各有一个月的休假，并保证发给她们工资。抚育儿童的母亲可以随时领取保护母子健康的费用，企业和机关中建立了托儿所、幼雅园，使妇女空出时间参加政治生活和生产工作。在解放区城镇乡村中普遍设有初级学校、夜校和识字班，妇女可以自由参加这些学校受教育，解放区妇女享有民主权利，是中国人民在长期残酷斗争中取得的。中国人民现在正在中国共产党领导下，进行着反对国民党反动派和反对美帝国主义侵略的解放战争，成百万的妇女和自己的丈夫兄弟共同参加了这个争取民主自由独立的英勇斗争。
