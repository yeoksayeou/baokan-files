Jiang Haixin, Explain Yourself!
  Why Did You Force Me to Divorce?
    A Complaint by Li Dongcheng
    After hearing about Jiang Haixin's oppression of poor people, which was published in the People's Daily on February 16th, I felt very heartbroken. Now I know that the People's Daily stands up for us poor people. Now I want to tell you about how Jiang Haixin forced my wife to divorce me:
    I live in Ziyuanzigou, Third District, Shexian County. My name is Li Dongcheng, and I am forty-seven years old. My parents died when I was very young. I have three brothers, and we all worked as long-term laborers for landlords. After my parents died, we three brothers separated. I also had a son, but he starved to death during the famine years. Now I am all alone. In the famine year of 1932, I fell ill in bed. My wife was forced to divorce me by Jiang Haixin, the village chief, and the next day she married Jiang Haixin's father. The facts are as follows: In October (I don't remember the exact date, but it was probably the beginning of the month), Jiang Haixin sent a militiaman named Li Chenghui to tell me that the village chief wanted to see me to talk about something. I asked him what it was about, and he said he didn't know. I was too sick to get out of bed, but he said I had to go. So I asked my sister-in-law to go. The village chief told my sister-in-law: "Quickly tell your brother to divorce his wife." My sister-in-law was afraid and didn't dare to ask why. Jiang Haixin said, "Go back and tell your brother to come quickly, or I will send militiamen to tie him up." My sister-in-law came back and told me that Jiang Haixin wanted me to go quickly, or he would send someone to tie me up. So I went with a cane. Wang Fenggang, the secretary of the village office, wrote me a divorce certificate. He said: "You are too sick to move, and there is no way to support your family. The government's laws cannot allow anyone to starve to death. Quickly divorce your wife." He also said, "Put your fingerprint on the divorce certificate and go to the district government to get divorced. You go first, and your wife will come later." So I went to the district government, and the cadres led my wife to the district government.
    The district head, Wang Ming, told me that Jiang Haixin had already made it clear to him that my wife didn't want to live with me anymore and insisted on divorcing me. I said, "The government's laws do not allow anyone to starve to death. I am too sick to move, so what can I do? If you say divorce, then divorce." He gave me half of the divorce certificate and told me to go back. So I came back. My wife didn't come back and went to her sister's house. The next day, she married Jiang Haixin's father, Jiang Rongfu. At that time, my wife was unwilling to go to her sister's house, but Jiang Haixin sent several militiamen to push and pull her to the district government to marry his father. Jiang Haixin gave my sister-in-law two hundred yuan and said, "Take this back and give it to your brother. This two hundred yuan is for selling his wife to my father." He also sent several people to my house to move all of my wife's dowry to his house. In October of the thirty-fifth year, the government called on poor people to speak out about their grievances. At that time, a speaking bitterness meeting was held. At this meeting, I brought up this matter. Jiang Haixin excused himself by saying that Li Wenhui's wife was the matchmaker. Later, the masses asked Li Wenhui's wife again, and she said that she didn't know. Then he said that Wang You's wife was the matchmaker, but Wang You's wife also said she didn't know. At this time, Jiang Haixin had nothing more to say. Later, the masses said that this matter could not be resolved today. Another meeting would be held later to let him apologize to you. But it has not been resolved to this day.

　　江海心你说说！
  　为啥强迫俺离婚？
    李东成诉
    二月十六日人民日报登的江海心压迫穷人的事，我听了非常痛心，我现在才知道人民日报是给俺穷人撑腰的。我现在把江海心压迫我媳妇离婚的事诉一诉：
    我家住涉县三区西戍园子沟，我名叫李东成现年四十七岁，我很小爹娘就都死了。我弟兄三个，我是老二，俺弟兄三都给老财住过长工。我爹娘死后，弟兄三就都另开了。我还有个儿子，过荒年也饿死了。现在只有我光杆一人了。三十二年灾荒那年，我病倒在炕上，我的媳妇被村长江海心强迫离婚，第二天就跟江海心他爹结婚了。事实经过是这样的：十月里（日子我记不清了，大概就是初几吧）江海心，派了一个自卫队员叫李成会的对我说，村长叫你去，有事情跟你谈。我问他有什么事，他说不知道。我正病的不能下炕，他说不成，一定要去。我就让我嫂去。村长就向我嫂说：快叫你兄弟跟他媳妇离婚。我嫂怕的没敢问长短。江海心说快回去叫你兄弟来，不来我就要派民兵去捆来。我嫂回来告我说，江海心叫你快点去，不去要派人来捆你去。我就柱了棍子去了。村公所书记王峰纲给我写了个离婚证，他说：你病的不能动，家里没办法，政府的法令不能饿死一口人，赶快和你的媳妇离婚。又说你给离婚证上盖个手印，去区政府离婚，你先去，你媳妇后面就来了。我就去区政府，干部把我的媳妇领到区政府去了。
    区长王明告我说，你的事情江海心早就和我谈清楚了，你的媳妇不愿和你过了；跟你一定要离婚。我说，政府的法令不让饿死一口人，我现在病的不能动，有什么办法呢，你们说离就离吧。他就把离婚证给了我半块，说你回去吧；我就回来了。我媳妇就没回来，到她姐家去了。第二天就和江海心他爹江荣富结婚了。这时我的媳妇在她姐家里不愿去，江海心派了几个民兵连推带扯就把我媳妇搞到区政府跟他爹结婚去了。江海心给了我嫂二百元，说你回去交给你兄弟，这二百元就算把他的媳妇卖给我爹了。还派几个人到我家，把我媳妇陪嫁的东西都搬到他家去了。三十五年十月政府叫穷人有苦诉苦、有冤诉冤。当时开了个诉苦会。在这会上，我就把这事提出来。江海心借口说：李文会媳妇说的媒，后来群众又问李文会的媳妇，她说我并不知道。他又说是王有的媳妇给说的媒，王有的媳妇又说不知道。这时江海心再没话说了。后来群众说，你这事今天还解决不了。过一时期再开会，让他给你认错好了。但一直到现在还没解决了。
