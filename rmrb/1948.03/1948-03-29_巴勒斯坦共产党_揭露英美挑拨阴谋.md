　　TASS, Bucharest dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Mikus, General Secretary of the Palestinian Communist Party, recently delivered a speech at a Jewish mass meeting here, exposing Anglo-American conspiracies, stating: British imperialism has turned Palestine into a slaughterhouse. They are using the conflict between the Arab and Jewish nations to prevent the implementation of the United Nations resolution on Palestine. At the same time, they are using fascist scum, Nazi officers, Anders mercenaries, and Arab reactionary armed forces to create chaos in Palestine. They are preventing ships carrying raw materials from unloading in Palestine in order to strangle local industry and increase unemployment. Mikus went on to point out that the Jewish and Arab reactionaries in Palestine are frightened by the growth of the labor movement aimed at liberating Palestine from imperialist oppression. These fellows now want to replace their former master, Britain, with American imperialism. Mikus concluded by saying that it is essential to establish a national democratic front in Palestine in order to unite all labor parties and launch a struggle for the establishment of an independent state in Palestine.

  　揭露英美挑拨阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：巴勒斯坦共产党总书记米库斯，近在此间犹太群众大会上发表演说，揭露英美阴谋称：英帝国主义者已变巴勒斯坦为屠场，他们利用阿拉伯、犹太民族的冲突，阻止联合国关于巴勒斯坦决议的实行。同时利用法西斯渣滓、纳粹军官、安德斯佣兵及阿拉伯反动武装，来制造巴勒斯坦的混乱。他们阻止载着原料的轮船在巴勒斯坦卸货，以绞杀当地工业及增加失业。米氏继指出：巴勒斯坦的犹太和阿拉伯反动派，对旨在把巴勒斯坦从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的劳工运动的生长，感到恐惧。这些家伙现在就想拿美帝来代替以前的主子英国。米氏在结语中称：在巴勒斯坦建立全国民主阵线，至为必要；以便团结所有劳工政党，为在巴勒斯坦建立独立国家而展开斗争。
