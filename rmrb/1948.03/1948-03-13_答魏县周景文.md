Medicine Q&A

Reply to Editor Zhou Jingwen of Weixian County:

I have an eight-year-old daughter, who is not thin. Starting from November of the lunar calendar last year, she suddenly developed a disease. First, she felt pain in the left tendon of her neck, her eyes involuntarily rolled around, and her eyeballs turned upwards. After a few seconds, her eyes would close tightly, her mouth would also close tightly, and her head would turn to the left with great force. Even if others tried to correct her head with both hands, her neck would be stiff. This lasts for about a minute (the duration varies), and then she is fine, just like a normal child. When she has an attack, people call out to her, and she vaguely knows it in her heart, but she cannot answer. The onset is not fixed, occurring once a day, several times, or not at all. Her fingers look like chicken claws, but they don't tremble. She hasn't taken any medicine yet, there are no hospitals here, or we can't afford to see one. Our whole family is really suffering! Therefore, we ask your newspaper to kindly introduce a treatment method.

Best regards!

Sincerely, Zhou Jingwen, Lijiao Village, Third District, Weixian County, Jinan.

Comrade Zhou Jingwen: Upon receiving your letter, we specifically requested a reply from Handan Halesheng Hospital as follows:

--Editor

Based on Comrade Zhou's letter, we can only understand the simple symptoms. The cause, specific symptoms, how often it occurs, and under what circumstances it is likely to occur are all unknown. Now we can only make assumptions and estimates based on the simple symptoms. Whether it is correct or not requires further study.

This disease may be facial nerve spasm, with symptoms resembling "hysteria" (visceral dryness syndrome). The cause of this disease is often due to nervous individuals being constantly stimulated and overexcited. On the other hand, it is closely related to parental heredity, or after suffering from various infectious diseases, excessive fatigue, coupled with a poor living environment, etc., these are all causes of the disease.

The treatment for this disease: 1. Avoid all stimulation to the patient, make her feel happy, comply with her personality, pay attention to nutrition, eat easily digestible food, allow her to rest, do less work, and take more warm baths. 2. You can take some sedatives internally, such as water-based or valerian preparations (for an eight-year-old, do not exceed 0.5 dosage at a time). 3. Based on our experience, it is best to find someone who knows how to perform acupuncture to give her acupuncture, using acupoints such as Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Jianyu (LI15), Dazhui (GV14), Jiache (ST6), and Dicang (ST4). First acupuncture the healthy side, then acupuncture the affected side. Use the reducing technique on the affected side and the reinforcing technique on the healthy side. Acupuncture once a day or every other day. Continuing with this treatment, there is a good chance of recovery.

　　答魏县周景文编辑同志：
    我有个八岁小女，身子也不瘦，从去年旧历十一月起，突然生了一种病，先觉得颈的左筋痛，两个眼不自主的转来转去，眼珠向上翻去，待不了几秒钟工夫，两眼就紧紧合着，口也紧紧闭着，头向左边很用劲的转着，别人用两手纠正他的头，颈硬的不行。约停一分钟（时间长短不一定）就好了，好后和平常孩子一样。当他犯病的时候，人们喊叫他，他心里也模糊知道，但是不能回答。发病的时候没有一定，一天一次或好几次或不发。他的手指好似鸡爪一般，但不发抖。到现在还没有吃过药，这里没有医院，有也瞧不起，全家的人真是苦恼极啦！为此请贵报费心介绍个治疗的方法。
    　编安！　　　　　　　　　　　
                           　冀南魏县第三区礼教村周景文恳托周景文同志：接到你的信，我们特请邯郸哈励生医院答复如下：
    　　　　     　　　　　　　　　　　　--编者
    根据周同志来信所谈，只能了解简单的症状，对其原因，具体症状，多少时间发一次，是在什么情况下容易发作等，均无从了解，现在只好将其简单症状作一推想和估计，正确与否还得继续研究。
    这种病可能是颜面神经痉挛，并有“歇斯忒里”（脏燥症）发作的模样，得这病的原因，一方面多是神经质的人，精神常受刺激，过度兴奋；另一方面是与父母的遗传很有关系，或害各种传染病后，过度劳累，再加上生活环境的不好等等，这些都是致病的原因。
    这种病的治法：一、避免对病人的一切刺激，使她精神能愉快，迁顺其个性，注意营养，吃容易消化的食物，使她能得到休息，少做活，多洗洗温水澡。二、可内服些镇静药，如水剂、＠草剂都可以（八岁龄，一次最多不要超过○·五的药量）。三、根据我们的经验，最好能找会扎针的人给她扎针，以针虎口、曲池、肩＠、大椎、颊车、地仓。先针好的一侧，后针有病的一侧，有病的一侧行泻针，没病的一侧行补针，每天或隔天针一次，这样继续针下去，很有希望能治好。
