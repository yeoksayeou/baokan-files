To the Editor:
　　Having read about Zhao Village, I saw that un-turned-over households only accounted for 10 percent. This naturally does not refer solely to all poor peasants. However, it seems safe to say that the land issue in this village has been largely resolved, with only small-scale adjustments remaining. After reading the news on the sixth that the village established a poor peasants association, I feel that in villages like Zhao Village, is the establishment of a poor peasants association inconsistent with the central instruction that poor peasants associations should not be established in situations where distribution has been realized and middle peasants constitute the majority? Will this lead to the isolation of poor peasants?
　　　　　　　　　　　Shang Yi
    Upon receiving Comrade Shang Yi's letter, we felt that this issue was very important. Our newspaper reporter immediately went to Zhao Village to investigate and studied the issue with the village work group comrades. We believe that in villages like Zhao Village, it is not only appropriate but necessary to establish a poor peasants association. The reasons are as follows: The poor peasant stratum in Zhao Village is still very large. Although most of them have turned over in the past one or two years, in reality, their foundation is weak, and they still have demands for economic improvement. Politically, because the poor and hired peasants were not the backbone in jointly running the village with the middle peasants in the past, the vast majority of them not only had not started to speak up, but also, due to the undemocratic nature of a few cadres and their detachment from the masses, they have been afraid to speak up. This situation means that the poor peasant stratum (including newly turned-over households) has not thoroughly turned over economically or politically, and the cadres and party members pose a great threat to the masses. The Zhao Village branch has lost its credibility among the masses. Therefore, if we want to mobilize the poor peasant stratum and all the peasants to be masters of their own affairs, we must first focus on mobilizing the poor peasants (including new middle peasants). Without establishing a poor peasants association, it is difficult for the poor peasant stratum (including new middle peasants) to play a backbone role, and there is no guarantee that the poor peasant stratum can thoroughly turn over economically and politically. Therefore, in Zhao Village, to implement the Central Committee and the Central Bureau's instructions on filling gaps, rectifying the Party, and promoting democratic movements, it is permissible to establish a poor peasants association.
    Will this lead to the isolation of poor peasants? Facts have proven that as long as we pay attention to uniting with the middle peasants in our work, establishing a poor peasants association will not only not lead to the isolation of poor peasants, but also make it easier to unite with the middle peasants. The reason is that the establishment of a poor peasants association can quickly mobilize the entire poor peasant stratum, demonstrate its strength in the Party rectification and democratic work, and establish its position. The middle peasants feel that the poor peasants association has strength, quickly stop wavering, and move closer to the poor peasants. On this basis, organizing a new peasants association and re-electing a new government, the poor peasants are active, and the middle peasants are also active, truly realizing the joint management of affairs by the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, uniting with the middle peasants.
    However, one point must be emphasized: In this round of filling gaps, Party rectification, and democratic movement, the Zhao Village poor peasants association only plays a backbone role and does not monopolize everything. For example, after the establishment of the poor peasants association, it quickly colluded with the middle peasants to establish a new peasants association and also established a peasants' representative assembly, and the peasants' representative assembly is the highest organ of power in the village. If various localities adopt this experience, they should assess the specific local conditions. If the establishment of a poor peasants association poses a risk of isolating poor peasants, it should not be established. The spirit of the central instructions should be resolutely implemented, and poor and hired peasants should never be isolated.
    The above is not necessarily correct. It is hoped that comrades readers and comrades of the work group can continue to discuss and study any different opinions.

### 赵庄成立贫农团是否会使贫农孤立？

　　赵庄成立贫农团是否会使贫农孤立？编者同志：
    前阅赵庄面貌，看到赵庄未翻身的窟窿户仅占百分之十，这自然不是仅指全部贫农而言，但这村土地问题，基本上已经解决，只是小范围内的抽补，似乎是可以肯定的。读六日报载该村成立贫农团消息，我感到象赵庄这样的村庄，成立贫农团是否与中央指示：平分已经实现，中农已占多数的情况下可不成立贫农团精神不符？这样是否会使贫农陷于孤立？　　　　　　　　　　　尚义
    接到尚义同志来信，我们感到这个问题很重要，当即由本报记者前往赵庄调查，并与该村工作组同志作了研究，认为象赵庄这个村庄，不但应该成立贫农团，而且必要成立，理由是：赵庄贫农层仍然很大。其中大部虽然在一二年内是翻了身的，但按实际情况来说，他们底子很薄，经济上翻身仍有要求。而在政治上，因为过去不是以贫雇为骨干联合中农共同当家，其中绝大多数人过去不但还没有开始说话，而且由于少数干部的不民主，脱离群众，使他们一直的不敢讲话。这种情况即是：贫农层（新翻身户在内）在经济上、政治上都没有翻透身，干部与党员对群众的威胁很大，赵庄支部在群众中已丧失了威信，因之，要想把贫农阶层与全体农民发动起来当家作主，首先如不以发动贫农（新中农在内）为主，不成立贫农团，想使贫农（新中农在内）阶层发挥骨干作用，是很困难的，想使贫农层在经济上、政治上翻透身也是没有保证的。因此，在赵庄这个村庄，要贯彻中央与中央局的填补、整党与民主运动指示，是可以成立贫农团的。
    这样是否会使贫农陷于孤立呢？事实证明，只要工作上注意团结中农，成立贫农团，不但不会使贫农陷于孤立，而且更便于团结中农，原因是因为成立贫农团，可使整个贫农层很快发动起来，在整党与民主工作中表现了力量，确立了地位，中农感到贫农团有力量，很快停止了动摇，靠近了贫农。在这个基础上，组织新农会，改选新政府，贫农积极，中农也积极，真正实现了以贫雇为骨干联合中农共同当家主事。
    但有一点须要强调说明：赵庄贫农团在这次填补整党与民主运动中，只起骨干作用，并非包办一切，如贫农团成立后即很快串连中农成立新农会，并建立了农代会，而农代会是全村最高权力机关。各地如采用这一经验，应估计当地具体情况，如果成立贫农团，有使贫农陷于孤立的危险，则不应成立，中央指示的精神应坚决贯彻，决不应使贫雇陷于孤立。
    以上所谈，不一定正确，希读者同志与工作组同志有不同意见还可继续商讨与研究。
