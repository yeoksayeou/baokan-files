　　【Taiyue News】Since the Border Region Government issued a call to aid disaster victims in the Northwest, the Taiyue District Party Committee organs, the 8th Column Training Brigade, the Training Regiment Guard Company, the Military Corps Health Department Affiliated Hospital and other organs have donated one after another. Currently, they have donated more than 720,000 yuan and a batch of clothing. The Taiyue District Party Committee Organ Branch specially launched discussions among the groups, and unanimously agreed that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has suffered greatly under the devastation of the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandits, and this year's spring plowing has become very difficult. We cannot ignore this. Therefore, it was decided that all comrades in the organs would save 98,000 yuan from their food expenses from March 1st to the end of March, and individuals would also donate more than 110,000 yuan. The 8th Column Training Brigade promoted class friendship. More than 200 people in the school donated a total of more than 170,000 yuan, as well as towels and socks. Comrade Zhang Yonglian of the Training Regiment Guard Company said: "We cannot forget the revolutionary base areas when we make revolution today. I am willing to donate 3,000 yuan." The entire class of eleven people donated more than 10,000 yuan. The cooking班 also donated 15,500 yuan, and the entire company donated more than 200,000 yuan, as well as cloth socks and cotton socks. All the convalescents of the Military Region Health Department Affiliated Hospital unanimously stated: They will recuperate with peace of mind, and then go to the front line to aid the disaster victims in the Northwest. Seriously wounded soldier Dong Liangcai donated 3,000 yuan out of the 5,000 yuan his team gave him, and old cook Zhao Zhenyu also donated all 5,000 yuan he had saved through production. All the working and convalescing personnel donated a total of more than 140,000 yuan and a batch of cloth shoes and socks.
