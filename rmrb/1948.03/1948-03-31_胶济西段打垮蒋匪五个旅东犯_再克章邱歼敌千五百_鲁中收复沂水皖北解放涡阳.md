　　[Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 29th] From March 19th to 23rd, on the Jiaoji Front, the People's Liberation Army defeated the offensive of five brigades of Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the area east of Jinan, recaptured the three towns of Zhangqiu, Mingshui, and Longshan for the second time, and shattered the bandit leader Wang Yaowu's pipe dream of supporting Zichuan from the east. While the People's Liberation Army was encircling and annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Zichuan, Wang hastily gathered more than five brigades, including his 73rd Division, the 213th Brigade of the 2nd Division, and security regiments, and advanced eastward from Jinan. Fearing annihilation, the bandits of the 73rd Division moved eastward along the railway, while the rest of the bandits advanced side by side on both sides of the railway. On the 19th, the bandits of the 4th Security Regiment, climbing to Yawangkou, 45 li northeast of Jinan, were first met with a counterattack by the People's Liberation Army, and the bandits immediately collapsed. On the 20th, the bandits scurried to Mingshui, and on the 21st, to Zhangqiu, still more than 80 li away from Zichuan, but the five regiments of defending bandits and local reactionaries in Zichuan, totaling more than 12,000 men, were completely annihilated at midnight on the 20th. On the 22nd, Wang, in extreme frustration, concentrated aircraft and artillery to cover his infantry in a fierce attack east of Mingshui and Zhangqiu. The People's Liberation Army resolutely struck back, and by the evening, after more than 500 bandits were annihilated, they fled westward in disarray. The People's Liberation Army launched a pursuit, and Mingshui and Zhangqiu were recaptured again. On the 23rd, Longshan was recaptured, and south of the Xiaoqing River, the defeated bandits were pursued, capturing more than 200 people and guns each. In total, more than 1,500 bandits were annihilated in five days, and more than a dozen light and heavy machine guns and more than 350 rifles and carbines were captured. Now the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army has reached the area 30 li east of Jinan.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th] Our Central Shandong Local Corps recaptured Yishui City on the 24th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the city fled towards Linyi.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th] The 4th Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army correctly promoted military democracy in the battle of Zhoucun, discussing matters with everyone, and therefore captured eight enemy-held strongholds in five hours, captured more than 600 bandits, and the entire company was only wounded seven people, and was awarded a citation for merit. When the company's attack developed to the main street south of the Wusheng Gate in Zhoucun, it was decided to blow up a building opposite, but the enemy's artillery fire was tightly sealed off, and the battalion commander personally observed that it was difficult, but at the suggestion of Squad Leader Zou Hongmin of the 8th Squad, the building was quickly blown up, and the entire company successfully broke through. The 3rd Platoon of the company then discovered that there were enemies guarding a building in front. The company commander came up with a way to solicit everyone's opinions. Soldier Zhou Peihe believed that it was easy to be injured by the enemy and proposed another method, which was accepted by the company commander after consideration, and finally made ten enemies surrender their guns. After the education of these examples, the soldiers' courage greatly increased, and the cadres were more cautious in handling each situation, and almost every determination was integrated with the correct opinions of the masses. In the final encirclement and annihilation of the enemy division headquarters, the opinions of Platoon Leader Wei Xinting and soldier Ding Jingzhu were adopted by the company commander, and the entire company cooperated with friendly neighbors to annihilate all the enemies.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Front, 29th] Late news: On the night of the 7th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army raided Guoyang City in southern Anhui, and the defending enemies fled upon hearing the news, and the city was recovered by us.

    【新华社华东前线二十九日电】胶济前线解放军十九日至二十三日在济南以东地区，击败蒋匪五个旅的进攻，二次收复章邱、明水、龙山三城镇，粉碎匪首王耀武妄图东援淄川的迷梦。当解放军正在围歼淄川蒋匪之际，王匪慌忙凑集其整七三师、整二师之二一三旅及保安团等五个旅以上的兵力，自济南东犯。匪恐被歼，以整七三师沿铁路向东，其余匪部分在铁路两侧，齐头并进。十九日匪保四团爬到济南东北四十五里的鸭旺口，即首遭解放军迎击，该匪即溃不成军。二十日匪窜至明水，二十一日窜至章邱，远离淄川尚有八十余里，但淄川守匪五个团及土顽等一万二千余人，已于二十日午夜全军覆没。二十二日王匪恼羞万分，集中飞机大炮掩护其步兵向明水、章邱以东猛攻，解放军坚决痛击，迄晚匪被歼五百余名后，狼狈西窜，解放军夺起追击，明水、章邱当再告收复，二十三日收复龙山，并在小清河以南，追击败匪，俘人枪各二百余，总计五天中共歼匪千五百余名，缴获轻重机枪十余挺、步马枪三百五十余支，现解放军前锋又抵济南以东三十里地区。
    【新华社华东二十九日电】我鲁中地方兵团二十四日收复沂水城。该城蒋匪向临沂逃窜。
    【新华社华东前线二十八日电】解放军某部四连在周村战斗中正确发扬军事民主、遇事大家商量，因此在五小时内夺下匪固守据点八处，俘匪六百余名，全连仅负伤七名，荣获记功嘉奖。该连攻击发展到周村武圣门南的大街时，决定炸开对面一座楼房，但敌炮火严密封锁，营长亲自观察后也觉得困难，但在八班长邹洪敏建议下，很快的炸开了该楼房，全连顺利突进。该连三排继又发现前面一幢楼上有敌人据守，连长想了个办法，征求大家意见，战士周培和认为容易受敌杀伤，提出了另一个办法，经连长考虑后接受，终于使十个敌人缴了枪。经过这几个实例的教育，战士们勇气倍增，而干部对每一情况的处理都更慎重，几乎每次下决心都融合了群众正确的意见。在最后围歼敌师部时，排长魏信亭和战士丁京竹的意见为连长所采纳，全连配合友邻将敌悉数歼灭。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十九日电】迟到消息：解放军某部七日夜奔袭皖南涡阳城，守敌闻风逃窜，该城遂为我收复。
