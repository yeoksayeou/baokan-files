　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army captured Zichuan City, a strategic point on the Zhang (dian) Bo (shan) branch line of the Jiaoji Railway, at midnight on the 20th, annihilating nearly 10,000 enemies. The front headquarters has issued the fourth communique stating: "A part of our army launched an attack on the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Zichuan before dusk on the 19th. After 32 hours of fierce fighting, the battle ended victoriously at 24:00 on the 20th. The defending bandits, the Zibo Garrison Brigade headquarters and its 2nd Regiment, 3rd Regiment, the 106th Regiment of the New 36th Brigade of the reorganized 32nd Division, the Railway Regiment (formerly reorganized from the First Traffic Police Corps), the 3rd Security Regiment and other local bandits, totaling nearly 10,000, were all annihilated without a single one escaping. The commander and deputy commander of the bandit garrison brigade were captured alive. Detailed battle results are being investigated. Zichuan City is the eleventh city recovered by the People's Liberation Army since launching its offensive on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army captured Yilin, the most important commercial town in northern Jiangsu, annihilating more than 6,000 bandits. Simultaneously with the victorious offensive on the Jiaoji Line, the Northern Jiangsu Corps of the People's Liberation Army launched a powerful offensive east of Lianghuai, in the area between the Shuhe River, the Yanyan Canal, the Liutang River, and the Sheyang River. On the evening of the 16th, they besieged the fleeing enemy from Funing at Yilin (70 li southwest of Funing). The bandits burned the houses around the fortifications overnight, relying on wide and deep moats, attempting to resist stubbornly. After our army captured the outer fortifications of the enemy, on the 17th, the bandits were completely compressed to the southeast corner. On the 18th, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, they forcibly crossed the moats and broke into the village from the north, west, and east. Although the remaining bandits struggled three times by releasing poison gas, they ultimately could not escape their fate of destruction. The battle ended at 3:00 am on the 19th, and the entire 113th Brigade (missing the 339th Regiment) of the Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 51st Division was annihilated, and Yilin town was recovered. At the same time, another part of our army blocked and intercepted parts of the Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 72nd Division, reorganized 44th Division, and reorganized 51st Division from Huaian and other places on the Fu (ning) Huai (an) highway, killing and wounding over 1,000 bandits, and the remaining bandits fled in panic. Preliminary battle results statistics show that more than 6,000 bandits were annihilated, including more than 4,000 captured alive, including the 113th Brigade Commander Wang Kuang, and another 2,000 were killed or wounded. Sixteen mortars, thirty 60mm guns, five grenade launchers, thirty-nine rifle grenade launchers, thirty-one heavy machine guns, one hundred and fifty-six light machine guns, more than one thousand rifles, thirty submachine guns, and many other ammunition and military supplies were captured.
