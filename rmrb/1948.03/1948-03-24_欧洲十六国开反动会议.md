　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: A second conference of the sixteen nations participating in the "Marshall Plan," presided over by U.S. imperialism's agents Bevin and Bidault amidst condemnation from righteous people around the world, convened here on the 15th. According to various sources, this "Marshall Plan," aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of Western European countries and enslaving Western Europe, will, in accordance with the decisions of the London Conference on splitting Europe by the US, Britain, and France, bring in Franco's Spain and West Germany. At the same time, behind-the-scenes negotiations are being intensified. Bevin and Bidault, acting on the instructions of the U.S. State Department, are trying hard to draw Italy, Ireland, Turkey, Greece, and the three Scandinavian countries into a Western anti-democratic military alliance under the protection of the United States. The wooing of the reactionary government of Gasperi is particularly urgent. The official Roman newspaper admitted that Foreign Minister Sforza's trip to Paris on the 14th was to complete negotiations for Italy's accession to the Western European five-nation military alliance. At the beginning of the sixteen-nation conference, various internal contradictions have already emerged. In his opening address on the first day, the Danish Foreign Minister pointed out that the Scandinavian countries are deeply dissatisfied with having to buy German goods with US dollars.

　　欧洲十六国开反动会议
    【新华社陕北十九日电】巴黎讯：参加“马歇尔计划”的十六国第二届会议，在世界正义人士同声唾斥下由美帝代理人贝文与比道尔主持，已于十五日在此间召开。据各方消息：这个以干涉西欧国家内政及奴役西欧为目标的“马歇尔计划”，将按照美英法分裂欧洲的伦敦会议的决定，把佛朗哥西班牙和西德拉进去。同时，幕后谈判正加紧进行中。贝文和比道尔秉承美国务院意旨，正力图把意、爱、土、希以及斯堪的那维亚三国，圈到美国卵翼下的西方反民主军事联盟中。对于加斯贝利反动政府的拉拢，特别着急。罗马官方报纸供认：外长史佛卓十四日的巴黎之行，是为了完成意大利加入西欧五国军事联盟的谈判。十六国会议开幕之初，已露出内部的种种矛盾。在第一天揭幕式致辞中，丹外长指出：斯堪的那维亚国家对要以美元购买德货一事，深表不满。
