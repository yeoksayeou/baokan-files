　　[Taiyue News] To mobilize the people of the entire region to organize and intensify spring plowing, the Taiyue Administrative Office recently issued a proclamation, the main points of which are as follows: In our region, except for the border areas of the Jinnan New District, the Fifth District on the south bank of the Yellow River, and a small number of villages in the interior, land redistribution has been largely achieved. According to the instructions of the Central Committee, only supplementary adjustments will be made thereafter, and no widespread redistribution will be carried out. Land relations will no longer undergo major changes. It is hoped that all the people of our region will dispel all concerns and immediately start spring plowing with peace of mind. And pay attention to the following issues: 1. The government absolutely guarantees that whoever sows shall reap. 2. When supplementary adjustments require drawing land from new rich peasants or even some well-to-do middle peasants, the consent of those being drawn from must be obtained. The houses, livestock, grain, and other movable property of middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) are not allowed to be touched. 3. This year, the government will allocate 10,000 *shi* of relief grain and 270,000,000 *yuan* in loans, and organize work relief to solve some of the spring famine and difficulties with livestock, farm tools, fertilizer, and seeds for poor peasants. The past deviation of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants under the pretext of taking care of poor and hired peasants must be corrected. 4. During the spring plowing period, all localities must pay attention to combining war service with production, and ensure that the land of participating laborers and militiamen is also well cultivated. Labor points for participation in the war should be differentiated according to the season and length of time. 5. Special crops such as cotton, indigo, sugar, radishes, hemp, ramie, and tobacco should be promoted in areas suitable for planting. The government has decided that the burden of special crops will be based on the standard of grain production. 6. Production by public organs has been decided to end, and mass organizations are welcome to take over. In the future, the development of private industry and commerce will be more favorable. The government will resolutely adopt a policy of protection for private industry and commerce, and hopes that industrialists and businessmen in various places will set their minds at ease and boldly develop their production. 7. Middle peasants should not be excluded from mutual aid teams and cooperatives. All hired peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants), and new-style rich peasants should unite closely in production. 8. Cadres at all levels should resolutely abide by the Outline Land Law, return over-occupied fruits, correct all mistakes, stop bad work styles, and serve the masses loyally and honestly during the spring plowing period.
