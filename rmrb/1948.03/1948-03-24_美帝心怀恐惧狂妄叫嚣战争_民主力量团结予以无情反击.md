Fear, frantic aggression, and intimidating war cries; composure, relentless counterattacks, and powerful united struggle—these are the typical manifestations of the intense struggle unfolding this week between the imperialist and democratic camps.

Since the international swindler Marshall released the air of "the world situation is extremely serious" on the 10th, the reactionary U.S. government has successively convened a joint chiefs of staff meeting on "new military deployments," a cabinet meeting on the "international emergency situation," and mobilized its kept newspapers and radio stations to continuously spread anti-Soviet and war propaganda. Then, on the 17th, Truman delivered a狂妄and despicable speech, bringing this round of rumor offensives to its peak.

In fact, the reason why U.S. imperialism creates a war atmosphere and deceptive propaganda about a critical international situation is precisely a manifestation of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak and harboring inner fear; it is a gangster method of intimidation, with the following base purposes: (1) To pressure Congress to support its already bankrupt foreign reactionary policy, to "quickly pass the aid to Europe plan" (American Worker Daily), to cheer on the "Western European Group" currently being plotted, in order to use this to enslave Western Europe and oppose the surging people's movements in these countries, especially Italy, and to save its own approaching economic crisis. Because they are afraid of the growth of the strength of the Western European people, trembling in fear of "the danger that today's free men (referring to reactionaries) may become tomorrow's slaves" (U.S. reactionary congressman Stephen). The so-called "fifty-year treaty of economic cooperation and common defense" signed by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as the nature of the "Western European Group" being discussed at the meeting of sixteen Western European countries, completely expose this inner fear and insidious conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. According to Pravda, the so-called "defense treaty" and "Western European Group" are not only a group against the interests of peace-loving countries, but also a "police alliance" used to support the reactionaries facing crises in various countries and to deal with the growing "internal threats" in various countries. (2) To take this opportunity to suppress the domestic democratic movement in the United States, as the Hungarian Communist Party's organ and U.S. Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio said, "to scare dissatisfied masses, silence Wallace's opposition party," and "implement military measures to establish a militaristic country." (3) It is a campaign trick. U.S. Labor Party Congressman Isaacson pointed out sharply: "Truman is trying to frantically cover up the shameful failure of the Truman Doctrine with a war crisis, and is trying to get re-elected by this means." The U.S. reactionaries' frightening war cries and their conspiracy activities to enslave the people of Western Europe and suppress the democratic movement in the United States have been strongly exposed and countered by the people of the world. The signing of the twenty-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria has consolidated the chain of peace between Eastern European countries and the democratic bastion of the Soviet Union. The signing of the trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Switzerland has also dealt a major blow to the "Western European Group." The Second All-German People's Congress was also held at this time, and they issued a magnificent call on behalf of the German people, protesting against the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys' conspiracy to split Germany, opposing the Western European military alliance, and demanding a referendum to decide the unification of Germany.

The Italian people are determined to resist Truman's interference in their democratic elections. They are calm and full of confidence, and they want to "remove the Gasperi government, which serves foreign interests" in the April 18 election (Italian Avanti!). Democratic people in other countries such as France, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Denmark have also risen up to condemn. The French Communist Party's L'Humanité said it well: "All countries will assure the conspirators in Brussels with firm and calm actions that what they signed yesterday is just a piece of waste paper, and we are stronger than you." Yes, the people of the world are not afraid of the blackmail and intimidation of the liars, and they have full confidence in their own strength and bright future.

At the same time as the U.S. reactionaries create rumors of an "emergency" in the international situation, the footsteps of the domestic economic crisis are getting closer. This week, the wholesale price index of 35 commodities has fallen to the lowest point since last July—185.1, and the stock market also plummeted on the 17th, with a loss of 1 billion U.S. dollars in one day. The workers' movement has also emerged vigorously. This week, a large strike of more than 500,000 people has broken out and is still expanding. Among them, the miners' strike has affected 14 states, and the daily loss of coal will reach 1.7 million tons. These are giving a great satire to the creators of the "international emergency situation," because the "emergency situation" is not elsewhere, but in the United States.

### 美帝心怀恐惧狂妄叫嚣战争　民主力量团结予以无情反击

    美帝心怀恐惧狂妄叫嚣战争　民主力量团结予以无情反击
    恐惧、疯狂侵略和恫吓性的战争叫嚣，镇定、无情反击和强有力的团结战斗，这是本周帝国主义阵营与民主阵营展开紧张斗争时的典型表现。
    自国际大骗子马歇尔于十日放出“世界局势极其严重”的空气后，美国反动政府又先后召开了“军事新布署”的联合参谋会议，“国际危急局势”的内阁会议，并动员其御用报刊、电台连续散布反苏与战争宣传。接着杜鲁门又于十七日发表一篇狂妄而可耻的演说，使这次的谣言攻势达到了最高峰。
    其实，美帝所以制造战争空气与国际情势危急的欺骗宣传，恰恰是色厉内荏和内心恐惧的表现；是吓唬人的一种流氓手段，别有如下的卑鄙目的：（一）压迫国会支持其已经破产的对外反动政策，“迅速通过援欧计划”（美工人日报），为正在阴谋组织中的“西欧集团”打气，以便借此奴役西欧，并反对这些国家首先是意大利高涨的人民运动，挽救其自身逼近的经济危机。因为他们害怕西欧人民力量的壮大，战战兢兢于“今日之自由人（按指反动派），可能成为明日的奴隶之危险”（美反动议员史蒂芬）。已经签订的所谓英、法、荷、比、庐“五十年经济合作与共同防御条约”，以及西欧十六国会议讨论中的“西欧集团”的性质，更完全揭露了美帝的这种内心恐惧和险毒阴谋。所谓“防御条约”和“西欧集团”，据真理报称：不仅是反对爱好和平国家利益之集团，而且是一种“警察联盟”，是用来支持各国面临危机的反动分子，和对付各国国内日益滋长的“内部威胁”。（二）借此镇压美国内的民主运动，如匈共机关报和美工党议员马肯托尼奥所说的，“吓唬心怀不满的群众，封住华莱士反对党的嘴”，“实行军事措施，建立一个军国主义的国家”。（三）是一种竞选的伎俩。美工党议员伊萨克逊一针见血的说：“杜鲁门力图以战争危机来疯狂地掩盖杜鲁门主义可耻的失败，并企图借此得到连任”。美国反动派吓人的战争叫嚣，和奴役西欧人民与镇压美国民主运动的阴谋活动，遭到了世界人民的强有力的揭露与反击。苏联和保加利亚二十年友好合作互助条约的签订，使东欧各国与民主堡垒苏联巩固和平的锁炼全部结成。苏联与瑞士商约的签订，也给了“西欧集团”以一大打击。全德第二届人民代表大会亦适于此时举行，他们代表全德人民发出雄壮的呼声，抗议美帝及其奴才分裂德国的阴谋，反对西欧军事联盟，要求全民投票决定德国的统一。
    意大利人民则坚决抗拒杜鲁门干涉他们的民主选举，他们镇定而满怀信心，要在四月十八日的选举中，“把为外国服务的加斯贝利政府革职”（意前进报）。其他如法、英、美、荷、丹等国民主人民亦奋起斥责。法共人道报说得好：“各国将以坚决而镇定的行动，向布鲁塞尔的阴谋家保证说，他们昨天所签订的，不过是一张废纸，我们比你们更强大。”是的，世界人民是不怕骗子们的敲诈吓唬的，他们对自己的力量和光明前途，抱有充分的信心。
    与美国反动派制造国际局势“危急”的流言同时，国内经济危机的脚步是更近了。本周三十五种商品的批发价格指数，已跌到去年七月的最低点--一八五点一，十七日证券市场亦发生猛跌，一天损失达十亿美元。工人运动也隆然出现，本周已爆发了五十万余人的大罢工，而且还在扩大中，其中矿工的罢工已波及十四州，每日损失的煤将达一百七十余万吨。这些正给“国际局势危急”的制造者一个大讽刺，因为“局势的危急”不在别处，却在美国国内。
