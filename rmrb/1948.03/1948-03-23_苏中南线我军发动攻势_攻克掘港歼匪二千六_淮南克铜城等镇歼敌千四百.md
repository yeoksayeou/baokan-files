    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st: A unit of the People's Liberation Army, coordinating with the local armed forces of the 9th Sub-district of Suwan, launched an offensive towards the area southeast of Rugao and north of Nantong. On the 15th, they successively captured Juegang, an important bandit stronghold on the Ru (gao) Jue (gang) line, and Shigang, a major town 50 miles northeast of Nantong, annihilating all defending bandits. Simultaneously, our ambush troops intercepted a battalion of the bandit's 21st Division and a puppet security squadron at Chenjia Hotel (30 miles northeast of Nantong), wiping out the majority of them, with the remaining enemies fleeing back to Nantong city in disarray. Our Rugao East local armed forces captured the bandit stronghold of Shuangdian on the Ru (gao) Jue (gang) line on the 9th, completely annihilating over a hundred local bandits and Chiang soldiers. The above results, only from the capture of Juegang and Shigang, include the annihilation of over 2,500 bandits, including the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Security Corps of Jiangsu Province, a major battalion headquarters and two companies of the Rugao County Mobile Column, the bandit's 436th Regiment Garrison of the 21st Division, and personnel of the puppet district and township governments. Among them, over 1,500 bandits were captured alive, including Zheng Yan, the commander of the 7th Security Corps of the bandit province, Gong Wenhua, the commander of the 2nd Battalion, and Bao Quesheng, the deputy battalion commander. Captured items include one 82mm mortar, 43 light and heavy machine guns, over 700 long and short guns, and one vehicle. The remaining ambush results are still being verified.

    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st: Late-arriving news: A unit of the People's Liberation Army, coordinating with the local armed forces of Huainan, advanced into the area between Hongze and Gaoyou Lakes, annihilating over 1,400 enemies, and successively capturing major towns such as Tongcheng and Gucheng, completely recovering the vast area between Xuyi and Tianchang, and directly threatening the two cities. On the evening of the 25th of last month, our army began to besiege Tongcheng Town, 40 miles north of Tianchang, and captured the town at noon on the 26th, completely annihilating the five companies of the Tianchang County Security Team and the Home Return Corps defending the town, totaling over 600 bandits. Simultaneously, they routed two battalions of the bandit's 7th Traffic Police Corps coming to Tianchang's aid, annihilating and capturing over 200 of them, and pursuing them directly to the outskirts of Tianchang. On the 3rd of this month, our army took advantage of the victory and swung westward, successively capturing the three Chiang bandit strongholds of Gucheng Town, 50 miles south of Xuyi City, Zhitou Bridge, 20 miles southeast, and Laozi Mountain, 35 miles northeast, annihilating over 600 bandits from the security team and the joint defense team. The above battles resulted in the capture of a total of eight mortars, howitzers, and small cannons, 49 light and heavy machine guns, 56 Thompson and Carbine automatic rifles, and 749 long and short guns.
