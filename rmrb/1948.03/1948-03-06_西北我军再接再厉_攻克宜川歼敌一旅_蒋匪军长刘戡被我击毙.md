Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 4th: Following the great victory southwest of Yichuan, the People's Liberation Army captured Yichuan at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 3rd), completely annihilating the Yichuan city garrison, the 24th Brigade of Hu bandit's reorganized 76th Division, including the brigade headquarters and its subordinate 70th and 71st Regiments, the county's police brigade, the puppet county government, and other units. The results of the battle are still being tallied. Note: The reorganized 24th Brigade was first annihilated by our forces in the battles of Yan'an, Changqing and Jianjian last October, and brigade commander Zhang Xin and others were captured alive. The current 70th and 71st Regiments of the brigade are renamed from the 430th and 431st Regiments of the 144th Brigade of the 76th Division. Yichuan City was first liberated by our forces on October 21st last year, and we voluntarily withdrew on the 25th of the same month.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th: In the great victory on the 1st, in which the People's Liberation Army annihilated an army headquarters, two division headquarters, and four reorganized brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line elite troops southwest of Yichuan, it has been confirmed that Liu Kan, commander of the bandit's reorganized 29th Army, and Yan Ming, commander of the reorganized 90th Division of the 1st Army, were both killed in action. Liu Kan was from Taoyuan, Hunan, 49 years old, a graduate of the first class of the Huangpu Military Academy, a graduate of the sixth class of Chiang Kai-shek's Army University, an alternate member of the Chiang Party Central Committee, and belonged to the Fuxing clique. He successively served as commander of the 93rd Army, deputy commander-in-chief of the 14th Army Group, commander-in-chief of the 36th Army Group, and deputy commander of the Chongqing Garrison. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits invaded Yan'an last March, he served as commander of the left-wing corps, personally leading four divisions and seven brigades to invade our ＠ county from Luochuan. Yan Ming was from Qiyang, Hunan, 46 years old, a graduate of the fourth class of Huangpu Military Academy, and successively served as a regimental commander in Hu bandit's 1st Division, etc., and was a confidant of Hu bandit. They committed all kinds of evil wherever they went when they invaded the border region, and the people hated them to the bone. This time, they finally received the punishment they deserved.
