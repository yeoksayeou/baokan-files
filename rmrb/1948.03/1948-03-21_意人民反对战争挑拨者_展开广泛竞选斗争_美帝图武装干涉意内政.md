Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 17th: Rome dispatch: The Italian people are fighting against the instigators of a new war and striving for victory in the election. The National Women's Association, a component of the People's Democratic Front, organized 30,000 democratic women on the 14th to hold a large anti-war demonstration here, chanting the song "Down with the Atomic Bomb." A delegation from the association also submitted a declaration for peace, signed by two million women, to the Italian President. In the reactionary-controlled southern Italy, workers are also taking action to win the election. The Labor Committee of Southern Italy and the Islands recently held a conference in Reggio. At the meeting, Bitossi, the General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and a communist, urged the meeting to consider taking decisive action to solve the problems of the South. The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor lodged a serious protest with Interior Minister Scelba on the 10th, opposing the reactionary government's troops occupying towns and city houses in the province of Apulia on the 8th; searching workers' residences, and unreasonably arresting the union leader of Atella, accusing this as "electoral intimidation against the working people of Apulia Province." The Secretariat also issued a communique, criticizing the Gasperi government for violating the "truce agreement" of various parties during the election period, and warned that "the government should be held responsible for the provocations." However, despite Gasperi's various provocations and sabotage of the election, the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, confidently stated at the People's Democratic Front conference held in Genoa that when the new parliament (referring to the new parliament after the election) convenes, the Gasperi government "will no longer be the government of Italy."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 19th: News from various sources: As the Italian general election draws nearer, U.S. imperialism is preparing to make a "desperate gamble" to save the U.S. imperialist lackey Gasperi, who is about to be punished by the people. The American reactionaries have recently clamored about the so-called "European Recovery Program," "to be passed before April 18 to help the Italian election and oppose the Italian Communist Party." According to TASS: The United States is hastily attempting to immediately pull Italy into the Western European bloc, so as to use this as an excuse to interfere in Italian internal affairs before the Italian election. Furthermore, according to a revelation in the Roman Republic newspaper: Recently, Gasperi and U.S. Ambassador Dunn were negotiating for the supply of U.S. weapons to Italy. Also, according to U.S. broadcasting: The White House has granted Dunn special powers, so that he has the right to dispatch the American expeditionary force in Italy if the momentum of the Italian general election is unfavorable. Meanwhile, Colonel Briller, the former head of the Anglo-American military government under Yudin, wearing civilian clothes, has inspected the important airports in the area (South News Agency). At the same time, a U.S. State Department spokesman on the 15th madly shouted that "if the Communist Party wins in the next parliament, the United States will no longer give any aid to that country," attempting to intimidate the Italian people and cheer up the Italian reactionaries. However, this pretentious posture of U.S. imperialism has not strengthened the confidence of the Italian reactionaries. According to a United Press dispatch on the 15th: Italian reactionaries "are prepared to run away as soon as the Italian Communist Party wins the general election." According to a survey of the five largest cities in Italy, recent passport applications have exceeded the usual number by thirteen times. In the past two months, stock prices have fallen, while the prices of easily portable valuables such as gold and jewelry have risen sharply.

　　意人民反对战争挑拨者
  　展开广泛竞选斗争
  　美帝图武装干涉意内政
    【新华社陕北十七日电】罗马讯：意大利人民正为反对新战争的挑拨者及为竞选胜利而进行斗争。人民民主阵线组成部分之一的全国妇女协会，十四日组织三万民主妇女，于此间举行反对战争的大示威，并高唱“打倒原子弹”的歌曲。协会代表团并将争取和平的宣言递交意总统，该宣言有两百万妇女签名。在反动派控制的意南部，工人也为争取选举的胜利而行动起来。意南部及岛屿劳工委员会日前在勒佐市举行了大会，会上，意总工会书记共产党人比托西，敦促会议为了解决南方诸问题，应考虑开始坚决行动。意总工会书记局十日向内长谢尔巴提出严重抗议，反对反动政府军队于八日占领阿蒲利亚省各城镇及城市房屋；搜查工人住宅，并无理逮捕亚陶拉城工会领袖，指斥这是“对阿省劳动人民进行选举恫吓”。该书记局并发表公报，抨击加斯贝利政府违背选举期中的各党“休战协定”，且警告说：“政府应负挑衅之责”。但尽管加斯贝利对选举进行百般挑衅和破坏，意共总书记托格里亚蒂日前在热那亚举行的人民民主阵线大会上，对大选满怀信心地说：到新国会（按指大选后的新国会）开会时，加斯贝利政府“就不再是意大利的政府了”。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】各方讯：意大利大选日益临近，美帝国主义正准备作“拼死的赌博”，以挽救行将遭受人民惩罚的美帝奴才加斯贝利。美国反动派最近大肆叫嚣所谓“欧洲复兴计划”，“要在四月十八日前通过，以便帮助意大利选举，反对意大利共产党”。据塔斯社讯：美国正急急忙忙企图立即将意大利拉入西欧集团，以便在意大利选前就以此借口来干涉意内政。另据罗马共和报揭露：最近加斯贝利与美大使邓纳正协商以美国武器供给意大利。又据美国广播称：白宫已授邓纳以特别权力，俾意国大选势头不对时，有权调遣意境美国远征军。而犹丁前英美军政府首脑布里勒上校穿着便服，已视察了该地重要机场（南新社）。同时美国务院发言人十五日狂叫“如果共产党在下届议会中获胜，美国将不再给该国以任何援助”，企图借此恫吓意国人民，并为意反动派打气。但是，美帝这种虚张声势的姿态，并没有坚定意反动派的信心。据合众社十五日电说：意反动派“已准备一旦意共在大选中获胜，就赶快逃跑”。据意国五个最大城市的调查，最近的护照申请已超过平时十三倍，过去两个月中，股票价格跌落，黄金、珠宝等容易携带的贵重物品的价格则大涨。
