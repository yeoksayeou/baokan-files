　　Should Prohibit Organizing Fake Poor Peasant Associations

Editor Comrade:

    Your newspaper (February 28th) published a news item on page one, section two, titled "Many Villages in Taihang Discover Fake Poor Peasant Associations." We would like to raise this for your consideration. (1) Since the promulgation of the Land Law, the entire region has vigorously explained and promoted it. However, individual villages, without orders or instructions from higher authorities, have independently established fake poor peasant associations. Their actions, which violate the Land Law and are reckless, should be subject to disciplinary sanctions. (2) The subtitle "Leaders should pay close attention to inspection" does not, in our opinion, elevate the issue to the level of principle, and therefore lacks sufficient weight and is expressed too mildly. Actions that violate the Land Law should not only be immediately prohibited but also penalized, rather than merely "inspected." It is fundamentally unacceptable to do so. Before the rectification of the ranks, cadres are extremely impure, so there is no basis for establishing good poor peasant associations. (3) The title "Some cadres in Yuan氏 Seventh District rushed to hastily establish poor peasant associations" also fails to raise the issue to the level of principle. Labeling this behavior, which violates the Land Law, as "rushing" is highly inappropriate. It suggests that it is merely a personal attempt to show off and "rush," implying that establishing a poor peasant association is acceptable, but only "rushing and being careless" is a problem of a lack of seriousness in work style. This is because their work attitude is not honest enough, and they have not fulfilled their responsibilities, resulting in "carelessness," without recognizing the severity of their actions.
    
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Mu Yi, Junqing)

    Regarding the issue of fake poor peasant associations, the attention raised by Comrades Mu Yi and others is commendable. However, according to the actual situation, some fake poor peasant associations are being manipulated by bad elements with the intent to sabotage; others are indeed the result of carelessness and rushing. It is impossible to uniformly impose "penalties" or "sanctions." Leaders at all county levels should still conduct inspections, handle cases separately, and persuade and educate the masses regarding their blindness. Those few bad elements who deliberately create trouble should be appropriately punished. At the same time, to prevent similar situations from occurring, leaders at all county levels may issue a notice to all villages stating that without the leadership of a work team, poor peasant associations should not be organized, and all efforts should be focused on spring plowing production.

### 应禁止组织假贫农团

　　应禁止组织假贫农团编辑同志：
    贵报（二月二十八号）一版二条消息，标题为“太行不少村庄发现假贫农团。”愿提出和你们商榷。（一）自土地法颁布后，全区大力解释土地法宣传土地法。但个别村庄未得上级命令和指示就擅自成立假贫农团。他们这种违背土地法的胡作乱为行为，应受纪律制裁。（二）副标题“领导上应切实注意检查”，我们认为，还没提到原则的高度，故在分量上还不够，语气上还轻。象这种违背土地法的举动，除应立刻禁止外，还应受到处分，而非“注意检查”的问题，就是根本不许这样做。未经整编队伍之前，干部是极其不纯的，故也就根本谈不上成立起好的贫农团。（三）“元氏七区，有些干部抢先，马虎成立贫农团”一标题，我们认为也没提到原则的高度，象这种违犯土地法的行为，标为“抢先”，是十分不妥当的，照这样说来，他仅仅是一种个人出风头而“抢先”，似乎应该成立贫农团，而仅是“抢先马虎”没认真的工作作风问题，这是因为他们工作态度不够老实，责任未尽到，故“马虎”，而没认识到他的严重性。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（木易、军卿）
    关于假贫农团的问题，木易等同志来信提起注意是很好的，但据实际情况，有些假贫农团是为坏分子所乘，有意破坏；有些确是马虎、抢先，不能一律给以“处分”、“制裁”，各县领导上仍应进行检查，分别处理，对群众的盲目性，应说服教育；对少数坏分子故意捣乱的，则应予以适当处分。同时为防止发生类似情形，各县领导上可通令各村，没有工作组的领导，不要组织贫农团，而应全力进行春耕生产。
