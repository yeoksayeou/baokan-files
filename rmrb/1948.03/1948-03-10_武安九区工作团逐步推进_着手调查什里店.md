[Benbao Wu'an News] After the work group created preliminary experience in the Zhao Village base point and its surrounding ten villages, it sent a work team to Shili Store Village at the end of last month to carry out party rectification, democracy, and filling gaps. When a dozen comrades entered the village, understanding the entire village's political and economic situation without any prior investigation became the first task to be carried out. Several comrades in the work team had worked in Zhao Village for a period of time. When they came, they were introduced by a reliable poor peasant from Zhao Village, Fu Dachou. They found him here, and he introduced two or three poor peasants from each mutual aid group. The dozen or so comrades dispersed to visit each group. Some groups even held small investigation meetings. Later, they found one poor peasant elder from each group to hold an investigation meeting. In addition, they used some materials learned from the village-based organs and conversations with some village cadres and party members as reference, and gained the following preliminary understanding of the entire village:

	Large Population, Little Land, Small Yield
	Six Movements Generally Even

Currently, the entire village has 421 households with 1,457 people and over 40 hectares of land, averaging about 0.2 hectares per person, with an average yield of 2.7 *shi* per person. Among them are many sandy beaches, hillsides, fragmented land, and semi-barren land. According to elderly farmers, the village originally had over 50 hectares of land, but more than 10 hectares have been destroyed by floods since 1917. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the vast majority of farmers, in addition to farming their own poor land, often had to go out to work for others, and many people went to brick kilns and lime kilns in Yushe, Wu'xiang, and Ci'xian. In famine years, many even went to brick kilns in Mudanjiang, Guan'dong. According to the calculations of several poor peasant elders, around 1937, there were 376 households in the village, and 201 households went to work in kilns, 37 households were live-in farmhands, 17 were carpenters, and 9 were masons. Each household had more than one person; even if calculated as one person, those who did these jobs accounted for more than half of the total labor force in the village. Now, fewer people work in kilns, but there are still many who carry loads to sell bowls, melons, and fruits, and carry coal. Some middle peasants also have to rely on this to maintain their livelihoods. In the words of the masses in the village: "Our village is a beggar village!"

	Cadres Selfishly Occupy Good Houses and Good Land
	Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Have Many Gaps

Since the "first worker of the Eighth Route Army" came to the village in 1939 and the democratic village government was established in 1940, Shili Store has undergone six large-scale mass movements: rent reduction and debt liquidation in the winter of 1944 and spring of 1945, investigation and reduction of dead deed land in the winter of 1945, investigation of concealed land in the spring of 1946, filling and balancing in the winter of 1946 and spring of 1947, "separation from landlords" in the summer of 1947, and investigation of "air-raid shelters" in the winter of 1947. In the past ten years, the general situation of land changes is as follows: 1937: Landlords and rich peasants averaged more than 0.4 hectares per person, middle peasants averaged more than 0.17 hectares per person, and poor peasants and hired laborers averaged more than 0.06 hectares per person. 1945: Landlords and rich peasants averaged more than 0.27 hectares per person, middle peasants averaged more than 0.2 hectares per person, and poor peasants and hired laborers averaged more than 0.16 hectares per person. By September of last year, landlords and rich peasants averaged more than 0.14 hectares per person, middle peasants averaged more than 0.2 hectares per person, and poor peasants and hired laborers averaged 0.19 hectares per person. From this, it seems that the amount of land occupied by each class has generally tended to be average. However, because past movements did not uniformly adopt the filling policy, especially some village cadres used their power to obtain more land, or occupy more good and nearby land. For example, militia captain Li Songting, whose family of three originally had 0.47 hectares of land, exchanged 0.2 hectares of inferior land for 0.4 hectares of good land last spring. Now, each person's yield is more than 0.29 *shi*, exceeding the village's average yield of 0.09 *shi* per person. When village head Wang Xitang bought fruit trees the year before last, the masses were vying for a 0.4 hectare piece of good land outside the south gate, but he bought it himself. The houses allocated to other families cannot be moved, but the political director and his close relatives live in good courtyards. Some military dependents have also improved their situation considerably. On the other hand, there are still many households with gaps. Although the gaps are generally not too big, the number of households is still quite large, at least more than 30 households. Some of them are too honest to speak up, while others are lonely, widowed, old, and weak. The cadres' reason for not allocating land to them is "they don't make requests!" "They don't pay money, so whatever we give them doesn't count." "The old are old, the young are young, even if we give them some, what development can they have?"... Most of the land is of poor quality, or too far away and scattered. A few households also lack land. There are also many households lacking housing, and some houses are too dilapidated. For example, Wang Fucheng and others have no house and borrow houses from others. Old man Wang Yi lives in a grass shed he built himself that is less than one person high, and the quilt is so tattered that it cannot be lifted. It's simply not a place for people to live.

	Upper Street and Lower Street Make Factions
	Party Members and Cadres Are Not Democratic

From the tone of the masses' conversations, it can be heard that there is a major factional contradiction in the village, which is the contradiction between Lower Street and Zhaishang. This is a legacy of feudal society. The feudal class once used natural conditions (Zhaishang and Lower Street) and clans (the Fu and Li surnames are more common in Zhaishang, and the Wang surname is more common in Lower Street) to create contradictions to facilitate the rule of the working people, which still greatly hinders the unity of the peasants. The mutual aid groups in this village are particularly active, not only as production mutual aid organizations, but also as administrative units. The whole village is divided into ten large groups. Lower Street is from the first to the eighth group, Zhaishang is the ninth group, and another mountain village (Qiaoshang) is the tenth group. The main cadres are in the second and third groups, while the first, fifth, and tenth groups have the most poor peasants. Historically, Zhaishang was dissatisfied with Lower Street, and the masses in Zhaishang were also blindly dissatisfied with Lower Street, especially with the Wang surname, saying that they and the cadres had formed a clique. This factionalism must be broken in this mass movement. Especially the party members and cadres, who have formed a small faction, and their style is very undemocratic. Whatever happens in the village, whether it is mass movement, production, election of village cadres, election of labor heroes, etc., the branch decides what to do, and the branch is controlled by a few four or five people. There is also very little democracy within the party, and most party members just follow these few main cadres. Even if individual party members sometimes offer their own opinions, the main cadres ignore them. The village head himself also has many problems, and he is also suppressed by the political director and public security officer. He also said: "There is too little democracy within the party." The anti-despotism director is good at expressing his opinions at the branch meeting, but because his ideas are inconsistent with those of the main cadres, he is often "cursed." During the summer branch meetings, anyone who dozed off would even be slapped by the political director. When labor heroes were elected last year, the masses elected someone from the eighth group, but a few people in the branch said: "It's not okay if they're not a party member." The election was already over, but it didn't count, and they "elected" Wang Nanfang again. When the vice chairman of the farmers' association was elected, it was also decided by a few people in the branch that they had to elect party member Fu Zhangsuo. The masses were unwilling to elect him, so they put it aside and didn't elect him, spreading rumors that the election would not be held until they could "deliberate" and elect Fu Zhangsuo. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, most of the evaluators were also decided by the main cadres. The masses could only elect a few people, and even if they elected a few who could represent the opinions of the masses, they would not play any role. The main cadres also gave people "secret agent" hats at every turn. For example, the new middle peasants Wang Miquan and Wang Suode, etc., were accused of "sabotaging weapons" (with no concrete evidence) when they were harvesting grain last autumn. They were severely beaten by the public security officer and militia instructor, and were also locked in a room for three days, and no one was allowed to ask a question. According to Wang Miquan, it was because he had mentioned the public security officer's "corruption" during the "washing face and wiping black" last year, that he was falsely accused of being a "secret agent." The wife of Li Hui, a woman from the ninth group, was also falsely accused of being a "secret agent" by the political director. She cried to the village head several times before announcing in the mutual aid group that the "secret agent" hat would be removed. She was so angry that she became ill once because of this. Several main cadres casually scolded people, and "getting angry" was even more common. Many people reflected that the public security officer "stares at you three times when he speaks," and they don't dare to go to him to get a pass when they want to go out, but they can't avoid going. Having affairs with women is also a very common phenomenon among cadres. The masses are quite dissatisfied with their style. During the "washing face and wiping black" last summer, they "tore open the mouth" and "reported their merits" before the masses were mobilized. Those who made a few suggestions were retaliated against, so the masses still have great inner concerns and fear the village cadres. A few people even have revenge emotions. When the cadre party members heard about the party rectification, they said, "We are not afraid of the masses, but we are afraid of a few activists." Some of the "activists" in Shili Store are the old cadres who have stepped down and the people who can be controlled by these old cadres. The current cadres also control a group of "activists," and they have formed an opposition to each other.

The Shili Store branch was dissolved once in April 1944 because of impure composition. Class enemies such as Fu Peijian and Fu Shouliang had infiltrated, and it was dissolved by Chen Zongyi, the then district party committee secretary. After the dissolution, a new branch was established, and a group of old cadres (Wang XX, Fu Gaolin, etc.) were also pushed down because of collusion with landlords and bad work styles. However, the appointment of new cadres and the removal of old cadres were not decided by the masses democratically, but were done by orders from above, so the new and old cadres have been in opposition for a long time, and the masses have suffered losses. For example, in last year's "separation from landlords movement", many activists did not receive the fruits of the struggle and were dissatisfied with the current cadres. Wang XX encouraged them to make trouble.

	Party Members Mostly From Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers
	Forgot Their Roots After Becoming Cadres

There are a total of 28 party members, most of whom were developed in mass movements and production movements, and most of them are good in nature. (Before the liberation of Shili Store, most of them were poor peasants, some worked in brick kilns, some worked as farmhands, and some worked as coolies in Guanwai. Currently, among the 28 party members, 11 are new middle peasants, 10 are poor peasants, and 5 are old middle peasants; there are still two who are poor laborers or new middle peasants whose status has not been finally determined.) However, because there is no democracy within the party and they have not been educated enough, some of them only care about themselves after becoming cadres and forget their roots; others just follow the main cadres and have also picked up many bad work styles.

The class camp in Shili Store is also very chaotic due to man-made reasons. On the one hand, the struggle area is too large, and on the other hand, some feudal households have not been thoroughly liquidated. According to the poor peasants: "Since the struggle in our Shili Store, there has never been a thorough struggle! The landlords still live in their original houses and haven't moved." Wang Hei's mother said: "Some struggling households are eating better than us now." Last spring's "cutting off the tail" movement cut off many middle peasants and even poor peasants. For example, the poor peasant Wang Maocheng, whose father begged for food and he himself had begged for food, was "pursued for three generations." His grandfather had exploited people, so he was also listed as a "feudal tail" and his house was exchanged. Another example is Fu Qing, who was branded with the "second-class feudal" label. He has been a mason since he was a child, and is now sixty years old, and mainly relies on this craft to make a living. He previously had 0.3 hectares of land for three people, and later the farmers' association filled him with 0.24 hectares of land; but last spring, when they investigated feudalism, they said that his father had been a "rural deputy" fifteen years ago (actually running errands for others, he had been a mason all his life, and only became a errand-running rural deputy for a few days when he was over sixty), and was also a "local tyrant" (bad temper), so he was classified as a "struggle object". His son had just returned from the front line with a first-class merit from the stretcher team, his award flag was confiscated, and he was also held in a criticism meeting. According to the village cadres themselves, they were implementing the district's regulation that "the target of attack must account for a quarter of the total population" with an irresponsible attitude. (Whether there is such a "regulation" remains to be investigated.) More than 100 people were "ranked" at one point, and later increased to 78. At that time, the whole village was greatly shaken, and the masses were extremely panicked, fearing who would be investigated when they checked three generations. Last winter, in order to issue winter production loans as needed, a comrade from a certain agency had classified classes here. Because they adopted unscientific methods of analyzing classes (the standard was "only those who have spent two-thirds of their lives from the age of ten to the present as poor laborers can be counted as poor laborers"), the results also left a bad impression on the minds of the masses, hindering the improvement of the poor laborers' class consciousness and the unity of the middle peasants. After this class division, a district comrade and a comrade from a certain agency carried out a "transformation cooperative" from top to bottom. The masses originally requested the replacement of the cooperative director Fu Peiyu, but the district comrade supported the village cadres and did not allow the replacement. This made the masses even less believe that the cadres they were dissatisfied with could be replaced or transformed. The elected "poor laborer cooperative committee members" also did not play any role. The village cadres did not pay attention to them. For example, the mutual aid group leaders had to participate in the evaluation of loans. The cooperative's business was not discussed with these cooperative committee members, and everything was still handled by the village cadres. Some poor laborers were even more afraid to expect to be in power, while others did not know what the cooperative committee was at all.

After the publication of the Land Law Outline, the cadres decided to rename the cooperative committee as the "Poor Peasants' Association," supposedly with the village head as the "leader" and Wang Wentang (party member, branch education officer) as the "deputy leader." It is still manipulated by the main party members and cadres. The poor laborers all said they did not know what was going on with this "Poor Peasants' Association." When the work team comrades told them that they were going to classify classes and establish a Poor Peasants' Association in the future, someone said: "Classify agriculture? Is it like the last time when the middle peasants were classified as poor peasants and the poor peasants were classified as middle peasants?" (referring to the class division led by the village-based comrade of a certain agency last winter) Many people were dissatisfied with that class division. When talking about the "Poor Peasants' Association", Wang Loufang (poor peasant) said: "Didn't our village establish a Poor Peasants' Association?" They were afraid that that "Poor Peasants' Association" would count, and they were also afraid that "if we establish another Poor Peasants' Association, someone else will have a 'Poor Peasants' Association' to oppose our Poor Peasants' Association"; they were also afraid that the Poor Peasants' Association would still be manipulated by the cadres as in the past.

	Landlords Not Completely Struggled Against
	Middle Peasants Greatly Damaged

Because the Land Law has been published for a long time, and there have been many news reports about land reform and party rectification; especially in the nearby villages of Liuquangou, Zhao Village, etc., the work has been underway for a period of time, and the cadres and masses have been mentally prepared and have been waiting for the work team to come. On the cadre side, they initially felt "do they still need us?" They felt that there was no way out. Later, they formed the "Poor Peasants' Association" and tightened control over the masses in the second and third groups and some other people they were related to. When the work team first came and met with the village cadres, they all expressed themselves very frankly, emphasizing that "there are accounts to check," and said: "We often talk about Zhao Village's affairs together, and we read the newspaper together." "We can't do this well just by ourselves, your coming is to help us work; you mobilize the masses to give us opinions!" And they said, "We are not afraid of the masses giving opinions, but we are afraid of activists giving opinions." On the night the work team arrived (February 26), they held a branch meeting. At the meeting and even afterwards, they all showed a relaxed and happy look. Later, it gradually became heavy after two days.

On the mass side, some people said as soon as they talked to the work comrades: "I already knew about Zhao Village." "I've been waiting for you to come." Initially, because they couldn't figure out how the work team was going to do things here, they didn't dare to trust them and still had concerns, and didn't dare to give opinions. But after a little observation, once the opinions were raised, there were many. Some of the masses (such as Fu Erwei) were very clear about how to do it, but they still did not have confidence in their own power. The middle peasants are somewhat passive in production. Many families put manure on manure piles instead of applying it to the land.

During the initial visits, the masses generally did not raise any specific opinions about the village cadres. Many people said: "The village cadres are better than the cadres in other villages, and they don't oppress people like the cadres in other villages." Some people said: "I don't know much about the big cadres." Only by complaining about their own suffering did they start talking about the unfair distribution of fruits, but then they said: "Don't blame the big cadres, it's all the fault of the evaluators." Later, they said that the evaluators were still manipulated by the cadres. After a few days of visits and investigations, the work team comrades initially learned that the poor laborers had demands for being masters and distributing houses and floating property (there are still more than one room of fruits that have not been distributed, "all of them are good things"). Only when there is a systematic grasp of the overall situation of the village can the work be carried out well. But this cannot be obtained in a short period of time. When the masses are not well mobilized, it is not easy to obtain true and reliable materials. Now the work team comrades still supplement or revise their understanding of the overall situation of the village every day based on the materials obtained from all aspects.

　　武安九区工作团逐步推进
  　着手调查什里店
    【本报武安消息】工作团在赵庄基点及其附近十来个村创造初步经验之后，上月底又派一个工作组到什里店村，着手进行整党、民主与填补运动。十几个工作同志进了村子，啥也不摸底，了解全村政治、经济面貌，就成了首先要进行的工作。工作组有几位同志是在赵庄工作过一个时期的，来时由赵庄的可靠贫雇介绍了一位贫农傅大丑，到这里找到他，由他介绍了每个互助大组里的两三个贫雇，十来个同志就分散到各组去访问，有的组还开了小型调查会，后来又找每组一位贫雇老汉开了一个调查会，再加上从驻村机关了解的一些材料和一部分村干党员的谈话作为参考，对全村面貌有了如下的初步了解：
  　人多地薄产量小
  　六次运动大体平
    现在全村共四百二十一户，一千四百五十七口人，四十多顷地，每人平均约二亩九分六，产量每人平均两石七。其中很多沙滩地、山坡地、碎块地、半荒地。据年老农民谈：全村原有地五十多顷，但从民国六年以来，被洪水冲毁了十多顷。抗战前，绝大多数农民除了种自己那点坏地，还得时常出去给人家受，到榆社、武乡、磁县等地上砖瓦窑、石灰窑的人不少，灾荒年甚至还有不少到关东牡丹江等地上窑的。据几个贫农老汉挨户数算了一下：民国二十六年前后，全村三七六户人家，上窑的就有二○一户，住长工的三七户，木匠十七户，泥水匠九户，每户不止一个人；就是按一个计算，做这几样活的人，占全村劳动力的一半还多。现在上窑的人比较少了，但担挑卖碗、卖瓜果、驮煤“拾砍”的还很多。有些中农也要靠“拾砍”才能维持生活。用该村群众的话来说：“俺们村是个乞丐村！”
    干部自私占好房好地
  　贫雇被屈有不少窟窿
    自从三九年村里来了“八路军第一个工作员”、四○年成立民主村政权起，什里店共经过六次规模较大的群众运动：四四年冬四五年春的减租清债、四五年冬的查减死契地、四六年春的查黑瞒地、四六年冬四七年春的填平补齐、四七年夏的“与地主分家”、四七年冬的查“防空洞”。在十年之中，土地变动的大概情形是这样的：三七年：地主富农每人平均六亩一分多地，中农每人平均二亩六分多地，贫雇每人平均九分多地。四五年：地主富农每人平均四亩多地，中农每人平均三亩多地，贫雇每人平均二亩四分多地。到去年九月，地主富农每人平均二亩一分多地，中农每人平均三亩一分多地，贫雇每人平均二亩九分地。由这看来，各阶层占有土地数量已大体趋向平均。但由于过去的运动并不是一律采取了填补方针，特别是某些村干部利用权柄多得土地，或者占有较多的好地近地。例如民兵队长李松廷，家里三口人，原有七亩地，去年春天用三亩劣地换成六亩好地，现在每人合四石多产量，超过全村每人平均产量一石三；村长王喜堂在前年买果实时，南门外一块六亩好地，群众争着要，结果他自己买了。分配的房子别家不能搬，政治主任和他近门的几家却住到了好院子。抗属也有些翻身较高的。另一方面，也还有不少窟窿户，窟窿一般的虽然不算太大，但户数还相当多，至少还有三十多户。他们有些是因为太老实不敢吭气，有些是孤寡老弱；干部不叫分给他们的理由是“他们不提出要求哩！”“又不出钱，给多少还不都算了。”“老的老，小的小，多少分给他们些也就算了，还能有个啥发展？”………大部分是质量太差，或太远太分散，少数几户数量上也还不够。缺房的户口也很多，有的房子则太坏。如王福成等还没房，借住别家的房；老汉王义，住在自己搭的不到一人高的草棚子里，被子破烂得就提不起来，简直不是人住的地方。
    上街下街闹宗派
  　党员干部不民主
    从群众谈话的语气听出，全村有一个主要的宗派矛盾，就是下街和寨上的矛盾。这是封建社会历史上遗留下来的，封建阶级曾利用自然条件（寨上、下街两处）和宗族（寨上傅李姓多，下街姓王的多）制造矛盾以便于统治劳动人民，现在对农民的团结仍有很大妨碍。这个村的互助组特别活跃，不但是生产互助组织，而且成了行政单位。全村共分十个大组，下街是第一组至第八组，寨上是第九组，另有一个山庄窝铺（峤上）是第十组。主要干部都在二、三两组，第一、五、十组贫农最多。历史上寨上对下街不满，寨上群众也盲目的对下街不满，尤其对王姓，说他们和干部抱成一圪塔。这种宗派在这次群众运动中一定要打破。尤其是党员干部，更形成了一个小宗派，作风很不民主，村里作什么事，无论群运、生产、选村干、选劳英等，都是支部决定要怎么办就怎么办，而支部又是少数四、五个人把持的，党内也很不民主，大部分党员只是跟着这少数主要干部跑。即使有时个别党员也提出自己的意见，主要干部也不予理会。村长本身也有不少毛病，而他也受政治主任、公安员的压抑，他也说：“党内就是太不民主。”抗勤主任好在支部会上发表个意见，但因和主要干部心思不一致，常常挨“日砍”（骂）。夏天开支部会，谁要是打瞌睡了，甚至挨政治主任的耳光。去年选举劳英时，群众选了八组的，支部少数人说：“不是党员不行。”已选过了，不算数，又重“选”一次，“选”了王南方。选农会副主任时，也是支部少数人决定的，非要选上党员傅章锁不行。群众不愿选他，就搁下不选，放出空气说非“酝酿”得能选上傅章锁就不举行选举。分斗争果实时，评议员大部分也是由主要干部决定的，群众只能选少数几个，即使选上少数能代表群众意见的，也起不了啥作用。主要干部还动不动就给人戴“特务”帽子，如新中农王米全、王锁的等，去秋正割谷子时，曾被指为“破坏武器”（并无确实证据），被公安员、民兵指导员吊打得很厉害，还关在屋子里扣了三天，不许任何群众去问一句。据王米全说，是因为在去年洗脸擦黑时曾提过公安员“腐化”的意见，就被诬指为“特务”。九组妇女李会老婆也曾被政治主任诬指为“特务”，她到村长那里哭着诉了几次冤才在互助组里宣布把“特务”帽子摘掉，而她因此气得害了一次病。几个主要干部随便骂人，“起态度”更是常事。很多群众反映：公安员“一说话三瞪眼”，想出门，要开路条都不敢去找他，而又不能不去。乱搞女人，在干部中也是很普遍的现象。群众对他们的作风颇为不满，而去年夏天“洗脸擦黑”时，刚“撕开口”，群众未发动起来就又“表功”了，稍提了几句话的人反受打击，所以现在群众内心顾虑仍很大，对村干部有害怕情绪；少数人且有报复情绪。干部党员在听说要整党时，表示“不怕群众，就怕有几个积极分子”。什里店的一些“积极分子”是下台的旧干部和这些旧干部能掌握的人；现在的干部也掌握着一批“积极分子”；相互之间形成对立。
    什里店支部曾于四四年四月间解散过一次，是因为成份不纯，有傅培建、傅守良等阶级异己分子混入，由当时区分委书记陈宗义来解散的。解散后成立了新的支部，一伙旧干部（王××、傅高林等）也都因为和地主勾结、作风恶劣而被推下台。但新干部的任用和旧干部的撤职都不是经过群众民主决定，而是由上而下命令包办的，所以新旧干部长期对立，受损失的则是群众。如去年“和地主分家运动”中，有好些积极分子没分到果实，对现任干部不满，王××就鼓动他们起来胡闹腾。
    党员出身多贫雇
  　当了干部忘了本
    党员共廿八人，大部分是群运和生产运动中发展的，大部分本质上是好的。（他们的成份，在什里店解放前绝大多数是贫苦农民，有的上过砖窑，有的当过长工，有的在关外当过苦力，目前二十八个党员中，新中农十一人，贫农十人，老中农五人；尚有二人是贫雇或新中农，未最后确定。）但因为党内不民主，和教育得不够，他们有的当了干部就只顾自己，忘了本；有的只是跟着主要干部跑，也沾染上不少坏作风。
    什里店的阶级阵营也因人为的原因而搞得很乱。一方面是斗争面太大，一方面有些封建户并未彻底清算。据贫农反映：“咱什里店自有斗争以来就没有骨骨格格的搞过一次！地主还住在原来房子里没搬。”王黑的娘说：“人家有的斗争户这会儿吃的比咱好得多。”而去年春天那次“割尾巴”运动，则把许多中农甚至贫农都割了一下。如贫农王茂成，爹要饭，自己也要过饭，但“追三代”。祖父曾剥削过人，因此他也被列为“封建尾巴”，把房子给换了。再如挂上“二等封建”牌子的傅庆，他从小就当泥水匠，现在六十岁了，主要还是靠这手艺过活，他先前三口人五亩地，后来农会填给他三亩六分地；但到去年春天一查封建，说他爹十五年前当过“乡副”（实际是给人家跑腿的，他当了一辈子泥水匠，因好给街坊邻舍调解纷争，到六十多岁时才当了几天跑腿乡副），而且“恶霸”（脾气坏），就被划成了“斗争对象”。他儿子刚从前方担架队立了头等功回来，奖旗剥夺了，还被开批判会。据村干部自己说，当时是以不负责任的态度执行区上的“打击对象一定要占全人口四分之一”的规定（是否有此“规定”，尚待调查。）曾有一百多人“上了等级”，后来增到七十八人。当时全村曾大为震动，群众极为恐慌，怕一查三代不知道要查到谁头上。去年冬天，为了发放冬季生产贷款按需要，某机关工作同志曾在这里划过一次阶级，由于采取了不科学的分析阶级的方法（标准是“本人从十岁到现在渡过三分之二时间贫雇生活的才算贫雇”），结果也在群众思想上留下了不好的影响，对提高贫雇阶级觉悟与团结中农有了妨碍。这次划了阶级之后，区上和某机关一位工作同志由上而下的搞了一次“改造合作社”，群众原是要求撤换社长傅培育等的，结果区上的这位同志支持了村干部的话，不让撤换。这使群众更不相信他们不满意的干部能撤换、能改造。选出的“贫雇合作委员”，也没起啥作用，村干部不重视他们，如评议贷款，还必须互助组长参加，合作社业务也没找这些合作委员谈过，仍是村干包办一切，贫雇有的是因此更不敢想望掌权，有的则对这合作委员会根本不知道是怎么回事。
    土地法大纲发表后，就由干部决定把合作委员会又改称“贫农团”，据说是村长当“团长”，王文堂（党员，支部教育干事。）当“副团长”。仍是主要党员干部操纵的。贫雇对这个“贫农团”都说知道不清是怎么回事。当工作组同志和他们说咱以后要划阶级、成立贫农团时，有人说：“划农？就是象以前把中农划成贫农、贫农划成中农那一次？”（指去冬某机关驻村工作同志领导划阶级那一次）有很多人对那次划阶级不满。说到“贫农团”时，王楼方（贫农）说：“咱这村不是成立过贫农团？”他们是害怕那个“贫农团”就算数，又害怕“咱再成立个贫农团，人家还有个‘贫农团’跟咱的贫农团作对”；也害怕再成立贫农团还是和过去一样，是干部操纵的。
    地主没斗透
  　中农损害多
    因为土地法早已发表，报上登了土改、整党不少消息；尤其附近村庄柳泉沟赵庄等地，工作已经展开了一个时期，干部、群众思想上都已有了准备，早已等着工作组来。在干部方面，最初曾感到“是不是还要咱？”觉得没出路。后来到成立“贫农团”，并更加紧控制二、三组群众和其他一些有关系的人。工作组初来和村干见面，他们都表示非常坦然，强调“有帐可查”，说：“赵庄的事俺常一块谈，也一块读报。”“这事光咱干部搞，搞不好，你们来是帮助咱们工作的；你们发动群众给咱提意见吧！”并且表示“不怕群众提意见，只怕积极分子提。”工作组来到的晚上（二月二十六日），就召开了支部会，会上以至会后他们都流露出轻松愉快的神色。以后，两天才渐渐感到沉重。
    在群众方面，有些人和工作同志一谈就说：“早知道赵庄的事了。”“早等着你们来。”最初因为摸不清工作组在这里到底怎么搞法，还不敢信任，还有顾虑，不敢提意见；而稍稍观望之后，意见一提起头就很多。有的群众（如傅二位）对该怎么作说的头头是道，但对自己掌权仍没有信心。中农生产有些消极，有很多家把大粪浇在粪堆上，不往地里上。
    最初访问时，群众对村干部大都不提什么具体的意见，很多人说：“这个村干部就是比别村好，不象别村干部压迫人。”有人说：“对大干部不了解。”只是从诉自己的苦，才开始谈到分果实不公，但又说：“不怨大干部，都是评议员的过。”以后才又说评议员还是干部操纵的。经过几天访问、调查，工作组同志初步了解到贫雇是有当家作主和分房子、浮财（还有一屋多果实未分配，“尽是些好东西”）要求的。只有对全村面貌有了系统的掌握，工作才好进行。但这不是短时间内可以得到的，在群众没有发动好的时候，真实可靠的材料也是不容易得到的，现在工作组同志还每天根据各方面得到的材料补充或修正对全村情况的认识。
