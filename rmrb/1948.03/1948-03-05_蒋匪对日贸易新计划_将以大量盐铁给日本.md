　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's New Trade Plan with Japan
  　Supplying Japan with Large Quantities of Salt and Iron
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 1st, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government has formulated a 1948 Chiang-Japan trade plan, including 94 kinds of exports and 79 kinds of imports. In order to meet its internal war needs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits will import 12,500 tons of machinery, 500,000 tons of railway sleepers, and 200 tons of explosives from Japan. Exports will include 30,000 tons of pig iron, 500,000 tons of iron seedlings, and 500,000 tons of edible salt, in addition to soybeans, sugar, soybean oil, and peanut oil. This plan fully demonstrates that US imperialism is further transforming the Chiang-controlled areas into a raw material base for Japanese industry, especially heavy industry, and making Japan one of the supply stations for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' internal war.

　　蒋匪对日贸易新计划
  　将以大量盐铁给日本
    【新华社陕北三日电】据合众社南京一日消息披露：蒋匪政府已制定一九四八年蒋日贸易计划，包括九十四种出口货，七十九种进口货。蒋匪为适应其内战需要，将从日本输入一万二千五百吨机器，五十万吨铁路枕木，两百吨炸药。出口货中则包括三万吨铣铁，五十万吨铁苗，五十万吨食盐，此外为大豆、食糖、豆油、花生油等。此项计划充分显示美帝国主义正进一步变蒋区为日本工业特别是重工业原料基地，并使日本作蒋匪内战供应站之一。
