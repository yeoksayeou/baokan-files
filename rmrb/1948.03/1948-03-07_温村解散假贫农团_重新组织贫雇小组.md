　　【Taihang News】In Xiawen Village, Second District of She County, a fake Poor Peasant League was organized twice under the manipulation of bad elements and bad cadres, and both were overthrown and dissolved one after another. Some bad cadres in Xiawen Village, after reading the news in the Land Law Outline about organizing Poor Peasant Leagues, secretly appointed their cronies to organize a "Poor Peasant League" in order to continue to control power and cover up their mistakes, such as occupying excessive fruits; a total of one hundred and ten people were organized. However, after the organization was established, the poor peasants did not have the say, and the cadres were still in charge of everything, doing whatever they said. In early January, the district convened meetings of poor peasant and hired laborer associations in each village, and each village sent three "honest" poor peasants and hired laborers to participate. The poor peasants and hired laborers in Xiawen Village who had not yet been emancipated also wanted to go very much, but the cadres designated three "poor peasant representatives," including Li Huaiting and Zhang Naicheng, which the masses strongly disapproved of; after arriving at the district office, the district learned about Li Huaiting and sent him back. This time, the poor peasant representatives returned and said: "The district asked us to re-establish the Poor Peasant League, and truly let our honest poor people be in charge." From then on, it was nominally considered that the "Poor Peasant League" manipulated and utilized by bad cadres had been overthrown. After accepting the tasks assigned by the district, "poor peasant representative" Zhang Naicheng and others immediately convened a meeting of more than twenty poor peasants and hired laborers to review the members of the previously organized "Poor Peasant League," leaving a total of eighty people, which was officially the second establishment of the "Poor Peasant League." However, because it was not initiated from the bottom up by colluding and mobilizing the entire poor peasant and hired laborer stratum, and no true backbone was established, the team was still impure, and a few elements were in power. In this way, the Poor Peasant League became the only highest power organ in the entire village; assigning corvée labor, giving preferential treatment to soldiers' families, entertainment, etc., all had to ask the "Poor Peasant League." The middle peasants were panicked and could not figure out what the "Poor Peasant League" was doing in its daily meetings? In addition, some people in the "Poor Peasant League" said randomly, "We'll cut your tail off," which frightened the middle peasants even more. Later, after the cadres helping the village discovered this problem, they dissolved this "Poor Peasant League" again. Now, poor peasant and hired laborer groups are being reorganized.

　　温村解散假贫农团
  　重新组织贫雇小组
    【太行消息】涉县二区下温村，坏分子坏干部操纵下，曾两次组织假贫农团，都先后被推翻解散。下温村有些坏干部，看了土地法大纲中规定组织贫农团的消息后，为了继续掌握大权掩护自己多占果实等错误，便暗地私自指派自己亲信组织“贫农团”，一共组织起一百一十人。但组织起来后，贫农不当家，事事仍由干部作主，说怎干就怎干。区上在一月上旬，召开各村贫雇农会，每村派三个“老实”贫雇参加。下温村没翻身的贫雇也很想去，结果还是由干部指定了三个“贫雇代表”，其中有李怀廷、张乃成二人，群众就很不赞成；到区署后，区上了解李怀廷，给顶回来了。这次贫雇代表回来说：“区上叫重成立贫农团，真正由我们老实穷人当家”。从此，形式上算是推翻了坏干部操纵利用的“贫农团”。“贫雇代表”张乃成等接受了区上布置的任务后，马上召开二十余人的贫雇会，审查上次组织的“贫农团”团员，一共留下八十人，算正式二次成立“贫农团”。但因为不是经过自下而上串通发动整个贫雇层，没有树立真正骨干，结果还是队伍不纯，少数分子掌权。就这样，贫农团便成为全村的唯一最高权力机关；派差、优抗、娱乐等，都要问“贫农团”。中农恐慌，摸不清“贫农团”天天开会在干啥？加上“贫农团”有些人乱说“割你尾巴哩”，更吓坏了中农。后来，帮助该村工作的干部发现此问题后，又解散了这个“贫农团”。现正重新组织贫雇小组。
