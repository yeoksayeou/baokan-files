　　Snippets of News from Student Circles in the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
    ▲ Peiping dispatch of the 22nd: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in Shenyang have decided to forcibly conscript starving and freezing students into the army to serve the interests of the Four Big Families. Earlier this month, approximately 7,000 students in Shenyang were forced by the bandits to undergo training in winter camps.
    ▲ The Chiang Kai-shek bandits are implementing student military training in various areas. In Tianjin alone, in over twenty middle schools, more than 4,400 students have been forced to accept fascist military training this semester.
    ▲ After the Tongji bloodbath in Shanghai, the North China Student Federation issued a "Declaration Supporting the Tongji Bloodbath." Students in Peiping rallied in protest on February 7th. Over 3,000 students attended, unanimously reading the declaration of the eight universities in Peiping and Tianjin opposing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Ministry of Education's re-promulgated rules for student self-government associations, and swearing to "defend democratic self-government associations." Peking University raised Jiang currency 37 million yuan within a few days for Tongji injured students. Nankai, Beiyang, and Hebei Institute of Technology in Tianjin launched a joint campaign to protest against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's creation of the Tongji bloodbath.
