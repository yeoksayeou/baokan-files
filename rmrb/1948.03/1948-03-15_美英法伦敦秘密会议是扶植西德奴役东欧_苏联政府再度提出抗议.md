Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government, on the 6th, delivered another note to the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, protesting again against the trilateral conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, which unilaterally discussed the German issue, pointing out that this was to cancel the Potsdam resolution on the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers and to undermine the agreement of the German Control Council, because the issues discussed at the trilateral conference fell within the purview of these two institutions, contradicting the obligations of the four powers to act in unison on Germany. The note denounced the so-called "American plan" for Europe (including Germany), which has become the basis of the current policy of the US-UK-France aggressive bloc, and the establishment of the Anglo-American joint occupation zone is a preparation for the implementation of the so-called European "American plan." The fact that the Marshall Plan includes the Anglo-American joint occupation zone and the Ruhr, a powerful base for military production, reflects the attempt by certain American groups to restore Germany's war economic potential in order to enslave Europe. The note continued: The British "Western European Union" plan is a supplement to the Marshall Plan, thus exposing the political purpose of the American plan for Europe. The Western European Union is not intended to counter the resurgence of German aggression; on the contrary, it intends to incorporate the part of Germany that was once the pillar of Hitler's aggression, where German monopolists still maintain their dominance, into the Western European bloc to oppose those Eastern European countries that uphold universal peace and prevent German aggression, which will lead to a split in European politics; and create two camps of European countries. Thus, it can be seen that the American plan and the British plan have nothing in common with the interests of consolidating the peace and security of European countries. The result only benefits the instigators of a new war. The US-UK-France secret meeting in London was organized behind the backs of the Council of Foreign Ministers with Soviet participation, which proves that the three governments are willing to completely abandon their obligations. The London meeting is pursuing the same goal as the initiators of the Western European bloc against other European countries. The note concluded forcefully: In view of the above reasons, the Soviet government reiterates that the decisions of the meeting cannot have legal effect or international authority.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: London dispatch: The meeting on Germany illegally convened by the United States, Britain, and France in violation of the Potsdam and other agreements concerning Germany, which has been held secretly in London since the 23rd of last month, has come to a temporary end on the 6th of this month. During the course of the meeting, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg accepted instructions to participate in related meetings from the 26th. The communique issued at the end of the meeting on the evening of the 6th, as well as various sources, all confirm that the American imperialist conspiracy is to "turn West Germany into a colonial base for Wall Street through the London conference" (Southern Combat News). Currently, American imperialism and its lackeys, Britain and France, have reached a basic consensus on the following issues: (1) Establishing a federal German government to achieve its goal of dismembering Germany; (2) Coordinating the economic policies of the three occupation zones and jointly proposing to the sixteen Western European countries that West Germany should participate in the so-called "Western European Reconstruction Conference," and the "representation" of West Germany should be guaranteed by the US-UK authorities. According to various sources, this provision is essentially the merger of the three occupation zones, pulling West Germany into the "Western European bloc" and establishing West Germany's superior position in this bloc. (3) On the Ruhr issue, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg once requested to participate in joint control, but Britain strongly opposed it, and US Undersecretary of State Lovett also blatantly refused, even proposing the hardline demand that the United States should control the Ruhr alone. As a result, the US demands were substantially passed, that is, the so-called "international control of the Ruhr should pay more attention to the distribution of production and less attention to the management of the means of production." However, according to the communique, Britain and the United States still have differences on the issue of coal mine ownership.

　　美英法伦敦秘密会议是扶植西德奴役东欧
  　苏联政府再度提出抗议
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联政府于六日又以照会一件，分别递交英、美、法政府，再度抗议英、美、法片面商讨德国问题的三国会议，指出：这是取消波茨顿关于成立外长会议的决议，并破坏德国管制委员会的协议，因为该三国会议所讨论的问题，属于这二个机构的职权范围，与四强所承担的对德一致行动的义务相抵触。照会痛斥对欧洲（包括德国在内）的所谓“美国计划”，已成为美、英、法侵略集团现行政策的基础，而英美联合占区的成立，是执行所谓欧洲“美国计划”的准备。马歇尔计划将英美联合占领区及强大的军火生产基地的鲁尔包括在内，这一事实反映了美国某些集团企图恢复德国战争经济潜力，以达到奴役欧洲的目的。照会继指出：英国提出的“西欧联盟”计划，是马歇尔计划的补充，因而暴露了美国对欧计划的政治目的。西欧联盟并不是用来反对德国侵略的再起，恰恰相反，它要把曾为希特勒侵略支柱的德国垄断家们现在还保有统治地位的那一部分德国纳入西欧集团，以与那些维护普遍和平及制止德国侵略的东欧国家相对抗，这将导向欧洲政治上的分裂；并使欧洲国家形成两个阵营。由此可见，美国计划和英国计划对巩固欧洲各国和平及安全的利益，无丝毫相同之处。其结果仅利于新战争的挑拨者。英美法伦敦秘密会议，是瞒着有苏联参加的外长会议而组织的，这证明三国政府不惜完全抛弃他们所担负的义务，伦敦会议所追求的，正是反对其它欧洲国家的西欧集团倡议人之目的。照会最后力称：鉴于上述理由，苏联政府重申该会决定不能有合法的效力与国际上的权威。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】伦敦讯：美英法三国违犯波茨顿及其他有关德国问题的协议而非法召开的讨论德国会议，自上月二十三日即在伦敦秘密举行，至本月六日已暂告结束。在会议进程中，荷、比、卢三国接受指令于二十六日起参加与之有关的会议。六日晚会议结束时所发表的公报以及各方消息：均证实美帝的阴谋是“利用伦敦会议将西德变成华尔街的殖民基地”（南战斗报）。现美帝及其纵仆英法等国，在如下问题上已达到基本一致：（一）建立联邦式的德国政府，以达到其肢解德国之目的；（二）三占区经济政策的配合，并联合向西欧十六国建议，西德应参加所谓“西欧复兴会议”，而西德的“代表权”，由美英当局予以保证。据各方透露：这一条实质即为三占区合并，把西德拉入“西欧集团”，并确定了西德在这一集团中的优越地位。（三）在鲁尔问题上，法、比、荷、（卢会一度要求参加共同管制，英国激烈反对，美国副国务卿罗维特亦悍然拒绝，甚至提出应由美国单独控制鲁尔的强硬要求，结果，美国的要求实质上仍被通过，即所谓“国际管制鲁尔更多注意于生产的分配，较少注意于生产工具的管理。”但据公报透露：英美关于煤矿所有权的问题仍有分歧。
