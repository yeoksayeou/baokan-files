      [Taihang News] Spring ploughing production work in Pingshun County has been universally launched throughout the county. Most of the manure in the county has been delivered, and now the work has shifted to the tense work of repairing field edges and building embankments, chopping firewood, transporting charcoal, repairing farm tools, and preparing for sowing. After delivering manure, Beitou Village in the first district has been adding farm tools and livestock to solve the difficulties in spring ploughing. At a mass meeting on the 2nd of this month, each household reported the number of shovels and other farm tools they lacked. It was decided to open two blacksmith shops in the village to specifically make farm tools, and a carpenter to specifically repair and install them. The cooperative is responsible for buying bamboo baskets. After the farm tool problem was solved, everyone was even more motivated. Three or five households joined together to buy and exchange livestock. Among the 34 poor peasant households, just at the "Tiancang" meeting in Weizi Town, Lucheng, they bought and exchanged 12 good donkeys, bought 1 mule and 1 ox. Everyone happily said, "We don't have to worry about not having livestock this year." The fourth district also held a joint meeting of village cadres and poor peasant associations at the beginning of the month to discuss production work. With the help of the district and the poor peasants, the village cadres realized that it is okay to have mistakes as long as they are corrected. Immediately, they began to discuss production. Everyone unanimously proposed that this year they should cultivate deeply and meticulously, and everyone should strive to increase the production of fine grains by three Sheng. The village chief and political director of Neon Village in the sixth district honestly reflected on their mistakes at the mobilization production meeting, and proposed to transform themselves in the leadership of production. They are now leading everyone in a heated tree planting campaign, having planted more than 4,000 trees such as soft jujube trees. After the rectification of mutual aid and the transformation of the landlords and rich peasant elements in power in Huangbeiping in the third district, Shuiyu in the sixth district, and Yanggao in the fourth district, the masses have great enthusiasm for various productions such as plowing and repairing land. Yanggao Village plowed 150 mu of land and built 42 Zhang of embankments in half a month, and also planted 3,200 production trees and miscellaneous trees, and cut 70,000 Jin of firewood. In addition to spring ploughing production work, each village has also extracted labor to carry out transportation and other sideline productions. In half a month, Yanggao earned 120,000 ocean by transportation and earned more than 1,300 Jin of rice by boiling saltpeter.
