Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 12th: New York dispatch: American labor is about to launch its third large-scale wage increase struggle since the war. Chicago packinghouse workers are scheduled to strike on the 16th, demanding a 29-cent hourly wage increase. The union, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, proves that a family of three cannot maintain a minimum standard of living unless packinghouse workers' hourly wages are increased by 29 cents. The CIO decided on the 8th to make huge wage increase demands. CIO economic advisors' wage research has proven that workers' real wages have fallen by 15 percent since January 1945, and even more when taxes are included. The CIO's United Electrical Workers Union has demanded a 35-cent hourly wage increase from Chrysler. Other unions, such as the Steelworkers Union and the United Auto Workers, will also make huge wage increase demands.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 12th: Comprehensive report: Under the oppression of the US government's militarist expansion policy, the burden on the average American taxpayer is extremely heavy. According to a recent announcement by the Federal Reserve, the US government's post-war loans and "gifts" to reactionary European governments amounted to $11.724 billion by the end of 1947. As a result, every American man, woman, and child has spent an average of more than $90 on this. The US government's post-war military intervention in China, and its "aid" to fill the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime's "bottomless pit" (as admitted by a US State Department official quoted by the Associated Press on the 27th of last month), such as the $4 billion estimated by Wallace, has also caused American taxpayers to waste an average of more than $30 per person. This burden on Americans is currently increasing. According to Truman's 1949 budget report, the expenses borne by Americans in 1949 for aggressive purposes (military spending and Marshall Plan expenditures) amounted to as much as $123 per person. Furthermore, according to a report in the Ta Kung Pao on January 12, the average American "feels the heavy burden of taxes. Each state and city now has sales taxes that did not exist before the war, and no daily necessities are exempt. The federal government is no less burdensome than the states, and everything from railways, telephones, and airplanes requires a few more cents of central tax in addition to the fare, which is quite annoying."

　　美国劳工生活艰难
  　即将展开增资斗争
    【新华社陕北十二日电】纽约讯：美国劳工即将展开战后第三度的大规模增资斗争。芝加哥的包装工人已订于十六日举行罢工，要求每小时增资二角九分，该工会根据劳工统计局的统计，证明包装工人每小时工资如不增多二角九分则三口之家无法维持其最低生活。产联已于八日决定提出巨大增资要求。产联经济顾问对工资的研究结果证明：工人实际工资至四五年一月以来，已跌落百分之十五，若将纳税计入，则跌落更多。产联的联合电气工人工会已向克利斯勒汽车公司提出每小时增资三角五分的要求。其他如钢铁工人工会、通用汽车公司工人工会等，均将提出巨大的增资要求。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报导：在美政府军国主义扩张政策的压榨下，美国一般纳税人的负担非常繁重。据联邦准备局最近公布，美政府战后资助欧洲各反动政府的货款与“赠予”，至四七年底已达一百一十七亿二千四百万元，因此美国男女老少平均每人为此已耗费了九十余元。美政府战后军事干涉中国，对填塞蒋匪政权“无底洞”（合众社上月二十七日引美国务院官员的自供）的“援助”，如以华莱士所估计的四十亿而言，亦已使美国纳税者平均每人浪费了三十元以上。美国人的这种负担现尚在加重中。根据杜鲁门四九年度的预算报告，美人四九年度所负担的用于侵略目的（军费及马歇尔计划费）之费用，竟高达每人一百二十三元。另据大公报一月十二日载称，美国一般人均“感到租税的繁重。各州各城现均有战前所没有的买卖税，日用物品，无一能免。联邦政府更不下于各州，举凡铁路、电话、飞机等，除票价之外，又须另加几毛几分的中央税，烦扰颇为不小。”
