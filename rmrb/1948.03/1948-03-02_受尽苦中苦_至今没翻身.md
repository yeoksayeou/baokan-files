　　Endured Endless Suffering
  　Still No Turnaround
    Xizi Niang's Account, Recorded by Mei Cun
    My name is He Shuzhi, and I am forty-eight years old this year. I live in Shizhuang Village, Yongnian Fourth District. My eldest child is called Xizi, so everyone calls me Xizi Niang (Xizi's mother). Since childhood, my maiden family was poor, and my parents couldn't support me. My mother raised me to adulthood and sold me for six strings of cash to Dan Kesheng, a farmer in this village who had no land for three generations. He is my current husband.

    When I was nineteen and married into his family, his father (referring to Dan Kesheng) was working as a farmhand for Hu Qinxiu, a big landlord in the village. His mother, his three younger sisters, and I made up a family of six. We farmed twenty-eight mu of land. Hu Qinxiu was a bad-hearted man who wouldn't give us good land to farm, only choosing the worst land for us. Of the grain we harvested, the landlord took three shares, and we got one. It wasn't enough to eat poorly and wear rags. All year round, we were short on food and clothing.

    In addition to suffering in the fields with his father, I constantly spun cotton, wove cloth, washed clothes, and looked after children for the landlord's family... For these tasks, they didn't give me wages, just some leftover food.

    After ten years of farming for the Hu family, I was twenty-nine. The Hu family took back the land. My husband then worked odd jobs for others. Besides spinning cotton and weaving cloth for people, I also constantly worked odd jobs—watering gardens....

    When I was thirty-one, my husband started farming for the Dan Lao Shi family. I went to work as a wet nurse for the old landlord Dan Lao San's family. The agreed-upon wage was three yuan and fifty cents per month, plus ten jin of cotton padding per year. In name, I was a wet nurse, but in reality, I was serving their wives and grandmothers, washing excrement, providing bedpans, everything had to be done....

    During the two years and ten months I spent in their household, the suffering and the anger I endured were endless. The landlord's family treated me worse than pigs and dogs, not regarding me as a human being at all. Take eating, for example: the landlord's family had white flour pancakes, noodles, pork, chicken, duck, sea cucumber, shark fin every day, cooked, stir-fried, pan-fried, deep-fried... every meal was several large bowls, several small bowls, several plates... while I could only eat some cornmeal buns.... When they were happy, they would give me some leftover bread crusts; when they were unhappy, they wouldn't give me anything, feeding it all to the pigs and dogs.

    My three children were at home with their grandmother. There was nothing to burn, nothing to cook. When they couldn't bear the hunger, the two older ones would go to find me, but how could the landlord allow these poor children to enter the gate? Every time they came, Dan Lao San would glare with his bull-like eyes and roar, "What are you doing here again?! Is this your home?! Get out of here! Don't ever come again!..." The children were scared and cried, and I cried too.... Once, my Yunzhi and Xizi went again, and the landlord's vicious dog bit the child, who cried outside the gate. Dan Lao San put on a stern face and said in a nasty voice, "Don't bother about him! Let it bite! He deserves to be bitten to death! Who told him to keep coming back? If he's bitten enough times, he won't come again!..." No one was allowed to go out to check on the dog.

    In the third year, after only ten months, the landlord's family wanted to reduce my wages (reducing it by five cents per month). I didn't agree, so they dismissed me. Because it wasn't a full year, the ten jin of cotton wasn't given, and five cents were deducted from each month. I was chased out of the Dan family's gate. I didn't have the face to go home, so I went to the city and found another landlord's family, staying until the end of the year.

    When I returned home, my husband and I farmed for the Dan Lao Shi family for another two years. The landlord took back the land again. I couldn't find any land to farm, so my husband worked odd jobs for people, pushing "oil soil" (in exchange for food and drink); I watered gardens for people, spun cotton, wove cloth, sewed and mended; the children went out to beg for food....

    Speaking of that period, the suffering was great! Working odd jobs for people only earned two or three jin of rice a day, and spinning a jin of cotton also earned three jin of rice (eating my own)... How could that support five or six people? Moreover, it was often impossible to find work! Pushing oil soil, pushing it for a whole day could only exchange for some broken black cornbread or one or two sheng of sorghum. What good was that? The children begged for food. If they got good food, the younger ones ate it; if they got bad food, the older ones ate it; they ran around all day, barely enough to eat. As soon as they got home, they would cry out that they were hungry....

    By this time, I had four children, each one pale and emaciated, like ghosts. As soon as they got home, they would howl, surrounding me and asking for food. My husband and I were also skin and bones, our stomachs rumbling all day, unable to bear it. We were anxious and worried....!

    Worrying to death didn't help! Being poor to that extent, we truly had no tears to cry to heaven, no door to enter into the earth. The only relative we had who was doing well was my own uncle, Zhang Chonghai's family. He was a landlord in this village. Landlords didn't regard us poor relatives at all. When I went to his house, I couldn't borrow a single grain of rice. Once, my husband went to Zhang Chonghai's house to beg for food and couldn't get any. It was the hired hand who secretly dug out a scoop of livestock feed.

    I went to nurse his child, hoping to earn some wages, but who knew I would be scolded and bullied for two months, without receiving a single penny. During the wheat harvest, I went to his field to glean wheat. As soon as my uncle Zhang Chonghai saw me, he rolled his eyes and said harshly, "What are you bothering us for again!?" I walked to the edge of the field, and the hired hand secretly gave me two bowl-sized wheat ears. Zhang Chonghai saw it, ran over, snatched the wheat away, and scolded me severely....

    In the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China (1940), my husband went to Guanwai to build a railway for six months and earned some wages. He made a rickshaw and pulled it in Linluo Pass. When business was good, he earned a few jin of rice a day; when there was no business, he returned empty-handed. At home, I still spun cotton and watered gardens for people as before; several times, I didn't eat all day, earning a little rice for the children to eat.

    Our family, big and small, struggled like this for a year, and every year we couldn't make it through the year. One year, by the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, we were still without food. Goose feather snowflakes were falling outside the door, and the ground was covered with a foot of snow. I was drenched, covered in snow, and went out to beg for food. I called at the gate of Zhang Xitang's house in our village three times, but they wouldn't open the door. Later, I turned to a relative's house (a landlord), said many good words, and got a teacup of cornmeal, half a sheng of bran, and seven black cornbread buns. That was enough for our five people to get through the New Year.

    We endured such days until the year before last, when land reform came. The higher-ups said we were going to turn over a new leaf, and I thought that these days of suffering were finally coming to an end. I joined the union and struggled against the landlords.

    Who knew that so many things were brought out, but we poor people didn't get much. From the year before last to last year, our family of five received a total of seventy-five jin of rice, twenty-nine jin of cotton, more than five thousand yuan (including the money from selling the divided trees), a broken cage, a bed, half of a livestock harness, a side panel, a table; in addition, five chi of red floral cloth (that broke with a finger poke) was auctioned for three hundred yuan, a small cabinet was auctioned for five hundred yuan, and a small tea table was auctioned for two cents. The fourteen mu of land and four rooms were only divided last spring.

    The land divided to me was all red land (without seedlings). I didn't have grain, and I couldn't farm on an empty stomach; I also didn't have livestock, farm tools (not even a hoe or pickaxe), waterwheels, or seeds... there was no way to farm. I wanted to return it to the union, but the village cadres wouldn't allow it. After saying many good words, they were "supported" to be given to a mutual aid team of nine mu, and I kept five mu for myself.

    Last autumn, I planted three and a half mu of melons, one mu of millet, and half a mu of sorghum. The furniture was borrowed from others, and the seeds were also borrowed from others. The grain (sorghum) borrowed when planting is still owed by twenty or thirty jin. With great difficulty, I planted it, but the soil was poor and didn't grow well. We also encountered a drought (without a waterwheel, we couldn't irrigate). The watermelons grew as big as bowls, and the cantaloupes grew like fists. The three and a half mu of melons yielded about thirty thousand yuan, which was used to pay off debts and buy grain to eat as we sold them. By the time the melon patch was empty, the money was gone. One mu of millet and half a mu of sorghum each yielded a cloth bag, paying back thirty-seven jin of sorghum, leaving only thirty-odd jin of sorghum and a cloth bag of millet.

    Soon after the autumn harvest, we didn't have much to eat. We had no food before the New Year, but we managed to get through the New Year with the help of the army and the poor peasant corps. Yesterday (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month), we ran out of food again. I ran around several times and borrowed a dou of millet and ten jin of corn, but it won't last for many days, and we'll run out of food again. Comrade, what do you say we should do? Spring plowing is coming soon, and we don't have livestock, furniture, or seeds, not to mention we don't have anything to eat, and people are too hungry to go to the fields!..."

　　受尽苦中苦
  　至今没翻身
    喜子娘诉  梅村记
    俺叫何淑芝，今年四十八岁。住在永年四区施庄村，俺大孩子叫喜子，所以人都叫俺喜子娘。自小娘家穷了，爹娘养活不住，老娘把俺养大成人。六吊钱卖给本村三辈子没地农民单可胜，他就是俺现在的男人。
    俺十九岁过门后，他爹（称单可胜）正给本村大地主胡勤修家种地。他娘、他三个妹子和俺共六口人。种人二十八亩地，胡勤修心眼孬，好地不给俺种，光挑些歹地让俺种。打下的粮食，地主分三勾俺落一勾。吃稀穿烂也不够。一年到头，少吃没穿。
    俺除给他爹一块下地受苦外，还不断给主家纺花、织布、洗衣裳、抱孩子……作这些活，人家不给工钱，光给一嘴剩饭吃。
    给胡家种地十年，俺二十九了。胡家把地夺去。俺孩他爹就给人家打短工；俺除给人纺花织布外，也不断给人打短工——浇园子……。
    到俺三十一岁上，他爹又给单老十家种地了。俺就去给老地主单老三家奶孩子。说定的工钱：每月三块五毛钱，一年外加十斤棉花套子。名义是奶孩子，实际上是侍侯人家的太太、奶奶们的，洗屎、端尿啥也得干……。
    在他家门里二年零十个月，吃的苦受的气说不完。主家对待俺真不如猪狗，根本不把俺当人看。拿吃饭说：主家天天是白面油饼、拉面、猪肉、鸡、鸭、海参、鱼翅，烹的炒的煎的炸的……顿顿是几大碗几小碗、几个碟几个盘……而俺只能吃点米面窝窝……人家高兴了，把吃剩的馍馍皮给点，不高兴了一星也就不给，都喂猪喂狗了。
    三个孩子，跟奶奶在家。没烧的没下的。饿的受不住了，两个大的就去找俺，可是地主那肯让这些穷孩子进大门？每次去，单老三见了都把牛眼一瞪，吼起来！“你又来干什么！？这是你的家！？快滚走！以后再不准来了！……”孩子吓的哭，俺也哭……。有一次，俺芸芝和喜子又去了，地主家恶狗咬的孩子在门外哭，单老三把脸一板，恶声恶气的说：“不用管他！咬叫咬！咬死活该！谁叫他一回一回来咧，咬怕了就不来啦！……”不准一个人出去看狗。
    到第三年，只住了十个月，主家要减俺工钱（每月减少五毛）俺不愿意，人家就不用俺了。因为不到一年，十斤花不给了，每月还扣去了五毛钱，俺被撵出单家门，俺没脸回家，又跑到城里找了一个主家，住到年底。
    到家和他爹又单老十家种地二年。地主又把地夺去了。俺找不到地种啦，他爹就给人打短工，推“油土”（换吃喝）；俺就给人浇园子，纺花、织布、缝缝补补；孩子们就出去讨饭……。
    提起这一段时光，受的罪可是大咧！给人的短工，一天才赚二三斤米，纺一斤花也是三斤米（吃自己的）……五六口子，怎能顾住？况且，时常又找不到活！推油土，推一天只能换点碎黑馍块或一升、二升高粱，又顶个啥？孩子们出去要饭要到好的，小的吃了；要到歹的大的吃了；跑一天，顾不住嘴，一到家就又喊着饿………。
    俺这时已经四个孩子了，一个个面黄肌瘦，象鬼一样，一到家就嗷嗷叫，围住俺要吃的。俺和他爹也一样瘦的皮包骨头，一天肚里咕咕响，撑不住，又心焦又发愁………！
    愁死也没法呀！穷到那个地步，真是哭天没泪，入地没门。俺只有一家亲戚好过，那就是俺亲舅张崇海家，他是本村一个地主。地主眼里是根本没俺这穷亲戚的。俺到他家，是一颗米也借不出来的。有一次，他爹到张崇海家要饭要不到，还是长工偷着把喂牲口的料给挖了一马瓢。
    俺去给他奶孩子，本想挣个工钱，谁知挨骂受气两个月，一个工钱也没给。收麦时，俺到他地里拾麦，俺舅张崇海一看见俺，就把白眼一翻，狠狠的说：“你又来扰啥哩！？”俺走到地头，长工偷给俺两个碗口粗的麦个，张崇海瞧见了，跑步撵过来，把麦子夺去，还臭骂了俺一顿………。
    民国二十九年，他爹到关东修铁路六个月挣下工钱，回来制了一辆洋车，在临洛关拉洋车。生意好了，一天挣回几斤米；没生意了，去一天空回来。俺在家仍象从前一样给人纺花、浇园子；有几次，俺一天不吃饭，挣点米让孩子吃。
    俺一家大小就这样弹挣一年，年年到头都过不去年。有一年，到腊月二十八，俺还断着顿。门外下着鹅毛片雪，地上盖了尺把厚。俺淋成了雪蛋蛋，出门去讨饭。到本村张喜堂家大门口，叫了三次人家不开门。后来，转到一家亲戚家（地主）说了好多好话，要到一茶缸棒子面，半升糠，七个黑窝子头，五口人才过了个年。
    这样的日子，熬到前年，土地改革了，上面说要翻身啦，俺也想这一下苦日月该到头了。俺参加了联合会，斗开地主啦。
    谁知斗出那么多东西，俺穷人可没分到啥。前年到去年，俺五口人，满共分了七十五斤米，二十九斤花，五千多块钱（分的树卖的钱在内），一个破笼，一张床，一根半截牲口套，一个厢板，一张桌子；另外，五尺红花布（指头一捣就破）讨了三百元，一个小柜子，讨了五百元，一个小茶几讨了两毛钱。十四亩地四间房，是去年春天才分的。
    分给俺的地，都是红地（没带苗），俺没口粮，饿着肚子种不了；又没牲口、农具（锄、镢头也没有）水车，也没有种子……没法种；想退给联合会，村干不允许，说了许多好话，才“拥护”给互助组九亩，俺自己留了五亩。
    去年秋天，种了三亩半瓜，一亩谷子，半亩高粱。家具是借人家的，种子也是借人家的，种地时借的口粮（高粱）现在还有二三十斤没还清。好容易种上了，地土薄，长不好，又遇到天旱（没水车不能浇），西瓜长的象碗口大，甜瓜长的如拳头。三亩半瓜，收了约三万元，一边卖，一边还饥荒、买粮食吃，到瓜罢园，钱也吃完了。一亩谷子、半亩高粱各打了一布袋，还人家高粱三十七斤，只落下高粱三十多斤，谷子一布袋。
    秋收后不久，俺就没啥吃了。年前曾断顿，在军队和贫农团接济下，才对付过了年。昨天（正月十五）又断顿，出去跑了几圈，借了一斗谷、十斤棒子，吃不了几天，又要断顿了。同志，你说怎么办？眼看快春耕了，没牲口没家具没种子不说，没啥吃，人饿的不能下地呀！……
