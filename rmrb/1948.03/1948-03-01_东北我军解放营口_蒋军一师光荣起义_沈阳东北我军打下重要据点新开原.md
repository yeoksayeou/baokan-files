Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, urgent telegram, 27th: The People's Liberation Army captured the important KMT bandit supply port city of Yingkou on the 26th. The entire 10,000+ troops of the KMT's 52nd Army, Provisional 58th Division, under the leadership of Division Commander Wang Jiashen, gloriously revolted, arresting the army's Deputy Commander Zheng Mingxin and more than 30 heads of the puppet Yingkou municipal party and government bandits. They resolutely withdrew from the anti-people civil war and were warmly welcomed by our military and civilians. The PLA launched an attack on Yingkou on the evening of the 25th, immediately occupied the airport, intercepted an American-style KMT aircraft that had just landed, and by the morning of the 26th, had completely annihilated the more than 2,000 stubborn enemy traffic police and constabulary, recovering the port city of Yingkou. The results of the battle are still being investigated. The Provisional 58th Division was originally the Fourth Column of the Northeast Security Forces, later reorganized into the Independent 9th Division, and soon after changed to the 13th Security Brigade. Last September, the bandit chieftain Chen Cheng reorganized the unit into the regular army Provisional 58th Division, subordinate to the 52nd Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, urgent telegram, 27th: Wang Jiashen, commander of the KMT 52nd Army Provisional 58th Division, which revolted in Yingkou, sent a telegram to Lin Biao, commander of the People's Liberation Army Northeast Military Region, and Deputy Political Commissar General Luo Ronghuan after the uprising, reporting on the uprising, saying: "Jiashen and others deeply feel that Chiang Kai-shek is dictatorial and sells out the country, creating civil war, opposing the will of the people, and eliminating dissidents. We have always wanted to join the revolutionary ranks, but had no good opportunity. Now, at 7:00 PM on February 25th, we resolutely led more than 10,000 troops to revolt, and at the same time arrested more than 30 KMT military, government, and party leaders such as Zheng Mingxin and Yuan Hongda in Yingkou, and participated in disarming the reactionary armed forces to liberate the important port of Yingkou. From now on, we vow to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek under your leadership, support the CCP's land reform program, and fight to the end for the liberation of the people, and pray for your guidance and instruction. We respectfully send this telegram, Wang Jiashen and all officers and soldiers salute together."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: Lin Biao, commander of the People's Liberation Army Northeast Military Region, and Deputy Political Commissar General Luo Ronghuan, recently sent a telegram to commend General Wang Jiashen, commander of the Provisional 58th Division, and all officers and soldiers who revolted in Yingkou, saying: "We are pleased to receive your telegram informing us of the glorious uprising of your unit, joining the revolutionary ranks to jointly punish the bandit Chiang. Your righteousness and strong words are admirable. The bandit Chiang sells out the country, exercises dictatorship, launches civil war, and harms the people. Anyone with blood cannot help but speak out. Now that the national counter-offensive has been formed, and the people's tide of resistance is high, it can be seen that the reactionary rule of the bandit Chiang, condemned by all, will soon perish. Your officers and soldiers have a clear understanding of the great righteousness, turned their guns against the enemy, and joined hands with the people's army, pointing out a bright path for the KMT officers and soldiers on battlefields across the country who are being driven by the bandit Chiang to wage civil war. Our army expresses its warm welcome to your glorious uprising. We hope that you will inspire the entire army, work hard to reform the troops, serve the people wholeheartedly, and work together to completely eliminate the bandit Chiang and liberate the entire Northeast and all of China."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, urgent telegram, 28th: At 4:00 PM on the 27th, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on Xinkaiyuan, an important stronghold of the KMT bandits northeast of Shenyang. By 7:00 PM, the battle was completely resolved, and Xinkaiyuan was captured. The entire defending enemy 1st Regiment of the Provisional 30th Division of the 53rd Army, as well as the remnants of the Provisional 62nd Division and the Transportation Battalion of the 6th Replenishment Zone who fled from Faku, and the Tongjiangkou "Suppression Team," totaling more than 3,000 troops, were wiped out without a single one escaping. The results of the battle are still being investigated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The Political Department of the Northeast Military Region recently sent another 23 captured KMT military officers back to their hometowns, including Chen Jiazhen, former commander of the Fourth Column of the KMT Northeast Security Forces and commander of the Changchun garrison, Chen Mingxin, former colonel and regimental commander of the Special Service Regiment of the KMT 71st Army, and another officer with the rank of colonel, and twenty officers with the rank of lieutenant.
