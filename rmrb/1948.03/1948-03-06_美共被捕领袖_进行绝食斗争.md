Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 4th: TASS, New York, March 2nd: Four outstanding anti-fascist leaders, formerly arrested by the reactionary American authorities: Communist leaders Williamson, Maritime Union Vice-Chairman and communist Smith, Chemical Workers Union Vice-Chairman Dole, and Eisler, have announced a hunger strike in the prison on Ellis Island. They are protesting the Justice Department's unreasonable refusal to grant bail before their trial and have written to Attorney General Clark, condemning him for imitating Hitler's methods of imprisoning progressives.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi: Washington dispatch: Idaho Democratic Senator Taylor, on the 23rd, delivered a nationwide radio address here, announcing his withdrawal from the Democratic Party. He has also agreed to run as the vice-presidential candidate for a third party in the upcoming election. Taylor attacked Truman for supporting "reactionaries all over the world," attempting to subvert the United Nations, and handing over control of the government to Wall Street and the military. He then stated that he could no longer remain in the Democratic Party, which had betrayed the principles he believed in. Taylor continued, saying that he gladly accepted the opportunity to fight alongside Wallace against the reactionary alliance of the two parties and was very pleased about it. Taylor said that he made this decision because he believed that Wallace was "the only leader to rebuild goodwill internationally." Taylor guaranteed that he would share weal and woe with Wallace in the heroic struggle for peace, which is gaining the belief of the people everywhere. Note: Taylor is a progressive within the Democratic Party, supporting labor interests, and has prestige among workers and peasants in the western states. Despite the various temptations and dissuasions of the reactionary leaders of the Democratic Party, Taylor finally decided to support Wallace, which will greatly strengthen the Third Party movement.

　　美共被捕领袖
    进行绝食斗争
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社纽约二日讯：前遭美反动当局横加逮捕的四个杰出的反法西斯领袖：美共领袖威廉逊、海员工会副主席共产党人史密斯、化学工业工人工会副主席多尔及艾斯勒，在里斯岛的监狱里宣布进行绝食斗争，抗议司法部拒绝在审讯前保释之无理举动，并写信给司法部长克拉克，谴责他仿效希特勒的方法监禁进步人士。
    【新华社陕北电】华盛顿讯：伊达荷州民主党参议员泰勒，二十三日于此间向全国发表广播演说，宣布退出民主党。并应允在未来大选中作第三党副总统的候选人。泰氏攻击杜鲁门支持“全世界的”反动派，企图颠覆联合国，并把政府控制权转交与华尔街和军人。他接着声明他已再不能留在背叛他所信仰之原则的民主党内。泰氏继称：他欣然接受与华莱士并肩斗争以反对两党反动联合的机会，并对此感到十分愉快。泰勒说：他所以作此决定，是因为他认为华莱士是“重建国际间善意的唯一领袖”。泰氏保证在争取和平的英勇斗争中，将与华氏共享甘苦，而这一斗争，在各地正获得人民的信仰。按：泰勒为民主党内之进步派，拥护劳工利益，并在西部各州的工农间具有声望。泰氏不顾民主党反动领袖的种种引诱与劝阻，最后决定支持华莱士，此举将大大加强第三党运动。
