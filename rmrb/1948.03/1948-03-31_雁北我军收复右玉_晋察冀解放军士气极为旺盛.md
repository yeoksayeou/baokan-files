Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 29th -- The Jin Sui Liberated Army recovered Youyu County in Yanbei on the 23rd, and the defending enemy, bandit Fu, fled beyond the Great Wall. Thus, all the counties in Yanbei that were occupied by bandit Fu last March have been recovered. Currently, there are no bandit traces west of the Tongpu Railway and south of the Great Wall.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th -- The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Army's front-line troops, after training and rectification movements, universally displayed a new atmosphere during this campaign to suppress bandit Fu, highly demonstrating the glorious traditions of the revolutionary army. Before departure, the vast number of commanders and fighters requested their superiors to issue orders to attack and eliminate bandit Fu as soon as possible. Everyone set up merit-making plans, striving to be model heroes. During the march, most of the regimental and battalion cadres went to the companies, while company-level cadres went deep into the squads and platoons to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner. When the troops arrived at the campsite, they generally ensured that the soldiers entered the houses to rest first, and the cadres rested only after the soldiers were asleep. Many regimental and battalion leaders helped the soldiers carry machine guns and pick up oil barrels. When Commander Ma of a certain unit crossed the mountain, he carried a machine gun for soldier Xue Wanyong and climbed over two mountain ridges. The soldiers shouted from behind, "Everyone look up, the commander is setting an example, let's hurry up and follow him, don't fall behind!" The team quickly passed the top of the mountain. Many units were very concerned about the fatigue of the cooks and scrambled to help the kitchen carry iron pots and oil barrels. Saving civilian labor was also a major feature of this march. For a certain unit's six-day march, the mobilized carts saved two-thirds of civilian labor compared to the advance to Qingzhou and Cangxian in May last year. In the health department of a certain unit, when the pack donkey got sick, the cadres carried the medicine boxes themselves. When the mortar company of a certain unit went down a large hillside, the mules could not walk. The regimental political commissar, company commander, and instructor first went to carry the shells, and all the commanders and fighters followed suit,抢着背炮弹. Because the cadres earnestly cared for the soldiers, they ensured the soldiers' health, which became the main reason for reducing the mobilization of civilian labor. Li Shuanggeng, the instructor of the ninth company of a certain unit, personally changed the medicine for the soldiers during the march, which quickly healed the sores on the soldiers' feet. Cadres with horses let the sick soldiers ride their horses and followed the team on foot, so many straggler collection teams could not find a single straggling soldier.

　　雁北我军收复右玉
  　晋察冀解放军士气极为旺盛
    【新华社晋绥二十九日电】晋绥解放军二十三日收复雁北右玉县城，守敌傅匪向塞外逃窜。至此，去年三月被傅匪侵占之雁北各县已全部收复，现同蒲路以西，长城以南，已无匪踪。
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】晋察冀解放军前线各部队，经过练兵和整军运动后，此次讨傅匪行军中普遍表现了新气象，高度发挥了革命军队的光荣传统。出发前，广大指战员纷纷要求上级早日下令打出去，消灭傅匪，每个人都订了立功计划，争做模范功臣。在行军中，团营干部多数到营连，而连级干部深入班排，去了解情况，及时解决问题。部队到了宿营地，一般做到战士先进房宿营，战士睡下了，干部才休息。许多团营首长帮助战士扛机枪、挑油桶，某部马旅长过山时，替战士薛万永扛机枪，爬过两道山岭，战士们在后面喊：“大家往上看，旅长作了模范啦，我们快跟上去，可别掉队呀！”队伍迅速通过了山顶。许多部队，很关心炊事员的疲劳，争相帮助伙房挑铁锅和油桶。节约民力亦为此次行军一个大的特点，某部六天行军，动员的大车，较之去年五月进军青（州）沧（县）时节约民力三分之二。某部卫生部，驮驴病了，干部自己抬药箱，某部迫击炮连下大山坡时，骡子不能走，团政委、连长、指导员，首先去背炮弹，全体指战员跟着也抢着背炮弹。由于干部认真爱护战士，保证了战士们的健康，成为减少动员民力的主要原因。某部九连指导员李双根，行军中亲自给战士换药，使战士脚上的疮很快治好。有马的干部，把马让给病号骑，自己跟着队伍走，因此很多收容队，收容不到一个掉队的战士。
