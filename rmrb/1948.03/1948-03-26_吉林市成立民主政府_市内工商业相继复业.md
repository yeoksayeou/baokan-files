Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: After Jilin City was liberated again, the municipal and city-level organs of the democratic government immediately moved into the city to work, and quickly established an urban management committee to actively carry out restoration work. The industrial and commercial enterprises of all ethnic groups in the city suffered great damage under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This time, when the bandit troops fled, they looted extensively, resulting in heavy losses. The democratic government specially convened a meeting of industrialists and businessmen from the entire city on the 12th to explain the various policies of the democratic government and decided to provide initial loans of 100 million Northeast currency (equivalent to 500,000 million Chiang currency) for relief. Deputy Mayor Zhang also personally went to various businesses to express his condolences. Now, shops on all streets have resumed operations one after another. In order to solve the food shortage, the municipal government has transported a large amount of grain from the Grain Bureau and entrusted more than 20 stores to sell it at low prices. In recent days, grain from the surrounding countryside has also continuously entered the market, and prices have generally fallen. Sorghum has fallen from 5,000 Chiang currency per catty to 4,000 yuan, and salt has fallen from 25,000 yuan per catty to 10,000 yuan. Schools at all levels in the city are actively preparing and will soon open one after another. On the 14th, the provincial and municipal governments jointly convened a meeting of representatives of teachers, students, and staff from the entire city. More than 1,000 people attended. After the government representatives announced the new democratic education policy, the representatives were extremely excited. The famous Xiaofengman Power Station, more than 30 miles away from the city, was destroyed when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled, and the river water has submerged the machines. The water level is also increasing daily. The democratic government is now actively stepping up the rush repair work. Provincial Chairman Zhou Baozhong and other military and political leaders are personally supervising the work. Despite the constant harassment by enemy aircraft, they are working hard day and night to repair it. The main transportation connecting the city, such as the railway to Xiaofengman, is now open to traffic. Other lines, such as the Tian'gang to Jilin section of the La (fa) Ji (lin) line, and the Jilin to Shuanghezhen section of the Ji (lin) Shen (yang) line, will also be completed and open to traffic within days.

    【新华社东北二十四日电】吉林市重获解放后，民主政府盛市两级机关立即迁入市内办公，并迅速成立城市管理委员会，积极进行恢复工作。该市各民族工商业由于在蒋匪统治时期遭受极大摧残，此次匪军逃窜时又大肆抢劫，损失甚重。民主政府特于十二日召集全市各工商业家会议，阐明民主政府各种政策，决定于最近初步贷款东北币一万万元（折合蒋币五十万万元）予以救济。张副市长并亲赴各商家慰问。现各街商店均已先后复业。市政府为解救粮荒，已由粮食局运到大批粮食，委托二十余家商店廉价推销。日来四乡粮食亦不断入市，物价普遍下降，高粱已由蒋币五千元一斤跌至四千元，食盐由两万五千元一斤跌至一万元。市内各级学校正积极进行准备工作，不日即可先后开学。十四日，省、市两级政府曾联合召开全市教职学员代表会，到会者共千余人，政府代表宣布新民主主义的教育方针后，与会代表均极振奋。距该市三十余里著名的小丰满发电站在蒋匪逃窜时被破坏，江水已将机器淹没，水位亦逐日增高，现民主政府正积极加紧抢修工作。省主席周保中及其他军政首长均亲自督工，虽在敌机不断袭扰下，亦日夜奋力抢修。连接该市之主要交通如通往小丰满的铁路现已通车，其他如拉（法）吉（林）线天岗至吉林段，及吉沈线吉林至双河镇段，日内亦可完工通车。
