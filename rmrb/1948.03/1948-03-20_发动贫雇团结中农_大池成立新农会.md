　　[Xiangyuan News] Dachi Village consists of five natural villages, with 70 households and 230 people, owning 1756.4 mu of land. With an average of 7.58 mu of land per person. The land reform movement began in July 1943 after the enemy retreated, during which seven landlords and eight rich peasants were struggled against, accounting for more than 21% of the village's households. (In this class designation, landlords and rich peasants totaled seven households, accounting for 10%.) Village cadres engaged in excessive occupation, cheap buying, stealing of fruits, corruption, and authoritarian rule, so the masses did not dare to speak out. After we arrived, we let the cadres seek out poor and hired peasants. Every poor and hired peasant's home we visited was afraid to tell the truth, fearing retaliation from the cadres. Later, we found Duan Youcai, a poor and hired peasant originally from Qixian County, Henan Province. He came to Shanxi to beg for food due to famine. He and his wife begged for food. He worked as a hired laborer and sold his eldest son, Rongsheng, to finally have 20 mu of bad land to cultivate. This man was upright and opposed injustice. Every day he went to the district to get letters, and if there was injustice in the village, he dared not speak in the village but would go to the district to speak. Village cadres were afraid that he would talk out of turn in the district, so during the movement, they gave him a few mu of good land. The villagers all said that Duan Youcai had turned over a new leaf. After interviewing, we learned that his transformation was very poor. Five people shared two rotten quilts and one mattress, and they ate thin gruel every day. Through this old man's connections, twenty-four poor and hired peasants were mobilized in three days, and sixty-eight poor and hired peasants were connected in five villages.

　　The poor and hired peasants in each village conducted mutual review, proposing "Four Wants and Three Don'ts" during the review. 1. Must be a year-round laborer. 2. Must have no relationship with landlords and rich peasants. 3. Must have proper conduct. 4. Must not have turned over sufficiently. Three Don'ts: 1. Don't have a relationship with landlords and rich peasants. 2. Don't be involved in secret societies. 3. Don't be a non-laboring waster, a rogue, or corrupt.

　　After this was proposed, Zhang Laiyou and others were reviewed and designated as poor peasant team members. Everyone then said: It's not enough for just a few of us; we must also unite the middle peasants who are not in the poor peasant group. So, a meeting of poor and hired peasants from the entire administrative village was held to establish a Poor Peasants' League and begin uniting with middle peasants.

　　The following conditions for joining the Farmers' Association were determined: 1. Year-round labor, 2. No relationship with landlords and rich peasants, 3. Proper conduct, 4. Not involved in secret societies (if involved in secret societies, declare to the Farmers' Association).

　　In this way, households were united to join the Farmers' Association. When admitting members, criticism and self-criticism were conducted, and their class status was determined. After this period, the emotions of the middle peasants stabilized, and the entire village carried out great unity, preparing to elect peasant representatives. After the class designations were made, Yan Jigou reflected: This is truly fair; it's not that whoever can talk to the cadres can change their class status. Now, whatever you are, that's your class status. Middle peasant Yan Zihua was preparing to donate land and not deliver manure before joining the Farmers' Association, but after being designated and joining the Farmers' Association, he was at ease with production. For example, the well-to-do middle peasant Han Fahai did not move before, but after being designated, he got up early to haul manure.

　　This village is a second-class village. After we understood the situation, we immediately stopped the branch's activities to conduct introspection, went deep among the poor and hired peasants. Under the pressure of the poor and hired peasants, the bad Party members began to reflect on their mistakes. The new Party members did not oppress the masses. The poor and hired peasants approved joining the Farmers' Association and the poor peasant group, and the middle peasants were approved by the masses to join the Farmers' Association.

　　[Pingshun News] In the Hongtigan base point, after visiting poor and hired peasants, a temporary poor peasant team was organized. The ideological concerns of the poor and hired peasants were initially resolved. In mobilizing and organizing poor and hired peasants, such as poor peasant man Lei Linze and woman Xu Sheze, eight people consciously went to the mountain village to connect and mobilize, proposing the following conditions for participating in the Poor Peasants' League: poor and hired peasants, year-round labor, upright character, good attitude, not selfish, and seeking benefits for poor and hired peasants. The conditions for not being able to participate in the Poor Peasants' League are: not upright, two-faced, untrustworthy, selfish, and unfair. It was also proposed that those who marry women from landlord or rich peasant families cannot participate in the Poor Peasants' League. After mutual review by the poor and hired peasants, ten people who married women from landlord and rich peasant families last year were left out. For example, poor peasant Shi Maohai married a landlord's woman after the review, and middle peasant Shen Renyu also married a landlord's woman last year. Shi Maohai's wife said to Shen Renyu's wife: "During the struggle, my husband beat my father, and I will never forget it. I dare not say anything to my husband." Shi Maohai said behind his back: "With this burden on my back, I don't even have the qualifications to participate in the Poor Peasants' League." Now, those who married landlords' wives are all worried. Whether these poor and hired peasants can participate in the Poor Peasants' League is currently under review.

　　In addition, problems of mass dissatisfaction were also discovered, namely, many fruits left over from last year's review movement. The leadership advocated using the fruits to build a Merit Pavilion, which has already used more than 1,800 workdays (incomplete), all paid for by the masses through labor exchange for rice. For example, poor hired stonemason Shen Liuze said: "I went to work on the seventh day of the tenth lunar month last year and returned home on the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth lunar month, working for eighty days without earning a penny." Also, poor hired Li Changze's family harvested five shi of grain, but had to contribute 300 jin of labor exchange rice for repairing the Merit Pavilion, which is more burdensome than several years' worth of burdens. The construction of the Merit Pavilion has been opposed by the entire village. Currently, poor and hired peasants are being mobilized to expose the problems, and the mass ranks are being reorganized.

　　发动贫雇团结中农
  　大池成立新农会
    【襄垣消息】大池村共有五个自然村，有七十户，二百三十口人，一千七百五十六亩四分地，每人平均土地七·五八亩，于一九四三年七月敌人退却后，开始翻身运动，共斗了地主七户，富农八户，占全村户数百分之廿一多，（这次划阶级，地主富农共七户占百分之十。）村干部多占、贱买、偷取果实、腐化、统治，群众不敢吭声。我们到后即放开干部找贫雇，每到一个贫雇家，都不敢说实话，怕干部报复。后来找到贫雇段有财家，他原籍河南淇县人，因灾荒讨吃，来到山西，孩老婆讨吃要饭，他当雇工，把他大儿荣生卖了，他才有了二十亩坏地种。这个人耿直，对不公的事，他就反对，他每日到区上取信，村上有不公的事，他不敢在村说即到区上说，村干部怕他到区上乱说，运动中给他分了几亩好地，村人都说段有财翻足身啦。经访问才知他翻身很差，五人伙盖两条烂被一条褥，每日吃的是些稀不溜。经这个老汉的串连，三天发动起二十四个贫雇，五个村串了贫雇六十八人。
    各村的贫雇互相进行审核，在审核中提出四要三不要。一、要常年劳动。二、和地富没关系。三、作风正派。四、翻身不足。三不要：一、不要和地富有关系。二、不要道会门。三、不要不劳动浪费、流氓、腐化。
    经提出后，把张来有等四人审核出贫雇小组。大家又说：光咱这几个人不行，还得把不在贫雇组的中农们联合起来才行，于是全行政村的贫雇开会，成立了贫农团，开始进行联合中农。
    又确定入农会条件：一、常年劳动，二、和地主富农没关系，三、作风正派，四、不是道会门（如是道会门向农会声明）。
    这样逐户的联合入农会。在吸收入会时，进行批评与互相批评，并给他划成份。经过这一段，中农的情绪安定了，全村进行大团结，准备选举农民代表。划成份后，阎计苟反映说：这才是真正公道，不是谁和干部说得着就能变了成份，现在是什么就是什么成份。中农阎子华，他在未入农会前，准备献田，不送粪，经划成份入了农会后，生产安心了。如富裕中农韩发孩，以前不动，经划了成份，早早就起来拉粪。
    这个村是个二类村，我们去了解后，即停止支部活动进行反省，深入贫雇，在贫雇的压力下，坏党员开始反省错误。新党员没欺压群众，贫雇批准入农会和贫雇组，中农由群众批准入农会。（襄垣四区工作组）
    【平顺消息】虹梯关基点，经过访贫雇，组织了临时贫农小组，贫雇思想顾虑初步解决，在发动组织贫雇中，如贫农男人雷林则，女人许舍则等八人，自觉到山庄串连发动，提出参加贫农团的条件：贫雇农民，长年劳动，为人正派，态度好，不自私自利，为贫雇农民谋利益等。不能参加贫农团的条件是：为人不正派，两头白面心口不一，嘴不牢，自私自利不公道等。又提出和地富女人结婚的也不能参加贫农团。经过贫雇相互审查，留下去年和地主富农妇女结婚的十人，如贫农石毛孩，在复查后娶了一个地主女人，中农申仁玉，也是去年娶了地主女人。石毛孩妻给申仁玉媳妇说：“在斗争中我男人打了我父亲，我永久忘不了，有啥话也不敢和我男人说”。石毛孩背地说：“我背上这个包袱，连参加贫农团资格也没有了。”现在娶地主老婆的都在发愁，这些贫雇是否能参加贫农团？现正在审查中。
    另外，又发现群众不满的问题，即去年复查运动中所遗留的果实甚多，领导上主张拿上果实修一座立功亭，现已用一千八百余个工（未成），都是群众变工出米。如贫雇石匠申六则说：“我自去年（阴历）十月初七日上工，到腊月二十六回家，做工八十天，没有赚下一个钱。”又如贫雇李常则家中收了五石谷，因修立功亭出了变工米三百斤，比数年负担还利害。因修立功亭遭到全村群众反对。现正在发动贫雇揭发问题，组织整编群众队伍中。（平顺工作队）
