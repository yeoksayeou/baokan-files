　　The world's democratic forces are developing strongly, while the economic crisis of US imperialism is drawing ever closer.
　　While US imperialism is plotting to organize a "Western European Bloc" and clamoring for "aid to Europe" and "aid to Chiang," within its own country, the people's democratic forces opposing this reactionary policy are developing, and its economic crisis is also drawing closer day by day. For example: First, US Communist leaders William Z. Foster and three other anti-fascist fighters have won their hunger strike in prison. The reactionary US authorities, intimidated by the unanimous condemnation of the American people, had to express their surrender and promised to release them on bail. This is another setback for the anti-communist, anti-democratic reactionaries in the United States, and also another proof that the US Communist Party has broad popular support. Second, the Wallace campaign has won even wider support. Committees to support the Wallace campaign have been established in 26 states, and the National Federation of Labor Unions and the Federation of Freelance Workers have also decided to support Wallace's campaign. At the same time, Wallace's vice-presidential candidate, Taylor, recently denounced the reactionary policy of US imperialism in the Far East, accusing Chiang Kai-shek bandits of being "one of the most brutal tyrants the world has ever seen," which reflects the "voice of the true American people." This shows that the brutal fascist measures of US imperialism can never stop the progressive trend of the American people. Third, the price declines plaguing US imperialism have become increasingly tight in recent days. After another sharp drop in agricultural product prices on the 8th and 9th, they have broken the lowest point of the February crash. On the other hand, production cuts in various heavy industry sectors are also beginning, with many factories reducing production and laying off large numbers of workers. "This is enough to show that the economic crisis is getting closer and closer." (TASS)
　　In Europe, the struggle between the democratic and imperialist camps is extremely fierce. US imperialism is personally coming forward, through the London Tripartite Conference and the Five-Nation Conference of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, to step up the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" and the conspiracy to organize a "Western European Bloc"; and is eager to bring Italy into this bloc. But this frantic attempt by US imperialism and its British and French running dogs has been vigorously countered. The Soviet government has once again lodged a serious protest with the United States, Britain, and France; democratic public opinion in Western European countries has also condemned it one after another; the German people have unanimously stated that "they will never agree to the London resolution"; and the struggle of the Italian people against the traitorous government of Gasperi, a pawn of US imperialism, is on the rise, and they are preparing all their forces to make the Gasperi government "atone for its crimes before the people on election day." And the bankruptcy of the conspiracy of American and British labor traitors to split the World Federation of Trade Unions is a major victory won by the democratic labor camp in the first round of the struggle against the "Marshall Plan." It must be pointed out that the reason why US imperialism is so eager to form a "Western European Bloc" is precisely a manifestation of US imperialism's outward strength but inward weakness. It fears the economic crisis that is getting closer and closer, fears the growing strength of the democratic camp in Europe, and is anxious that "once the Italian Communist Party wins the general election, not only will the United States lose its key location in Europe, but it will also make the Western European Union and the Marshall Plan impossible to implement" (TASS). According to various rumors, Britain, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands are about to conclude a military alliance in order to use this as a core to further organize a "Western European Bloc." But to take a step back, even if the "Western European Bloc" is formed, for US imperialism and its running dogs, it is only a more difficult shackle to break free from, because the so-called "Western European Bloc" is not only anti-Soviet and anti-Eastern European new democratic countries in nature, but first of all turns Western Europe into a colony and a military base for US imperialism, "to be driven by the US State Department" to enslave the Western European people. Therefore, the result will inevitably be to make the just movement of the European people against US imperialism and its running dogs even higher.
　　In the past week, the Greek Democratic Army continued its victorious advance, defeating an enemy division, annihilating three enemy battalions, and winning an unprecedented victory, frightening the royalist fascist elements in Greece fostered by US imperialism. "With the support of the broad masses of the people, the scale of the Democratic Army's counter-offensive has become larger and larger" (Soviet Red Star). In Southeast Asia, the people's armed forces and the National Peasants' Association led by the Philippine Communist Party are growing stronger and stronger, so that the Philippine traitor Roxas had to openly admit that his "suppression offensive" had failed, and shamelessly issued a reactionary decree declaring the above-mentioned revolutionary organizations to be "illegal," fully demonstrating his inner fear. Similarly, the people's guerrillas led by Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh, although under the pressure of the French imperialist's superior military force, have also become stronger, and the vast hinterland of Vietnam is still controlled by the Viet Minh guerrillas and the democratic regime. Even the French military spokesman in Saigon had to admit that the strength of the guerrillas "is still extremely strong." The movement for unification, independence, and democracy in South Korea is also developing. The draft temporary constitution of Korea promulgated by the North Korean People's Assembly the other day has become a banner to inspire the Korean people to fight. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 世界民主力量强大发展　美帝经济危机日更迫近

　　世界民主力量强大发展
  　美帝经济危机日更迫近
    当美帝正在阴谋组织“西欧集团”，叫嚣“援欧”“援蒋”的时候，在它本国，反对这一反动政策的人民民主势力正在发展，同时它的经济危机亦日更迫近。例如第一、美共领袖威廉逊等四位反法西斯战士，在狱中的绝食斗争已获得胜利。美国反动当局震慑于美国人民的一致声讨，不得不表示屈服，答应他们交保出狱。这是美国反动派反共反民主的又一挫败，亦是美共拥有广大人民支持的另一证明。第二、华莱士竞选运动赢得了更广泛的支持，拥护华莱士竞选运动委员会已在二十六州建立了州的组织，全国机关工人工会与自由职业者工会等，亦决定为华氏竞选的后盾。同时，华莱士的副总统候选人泰勒，日前痛斥美帝在远东的反动政策，指责蒋匪是“世界上从未有过的最残酷的暴君之一”，这反映了“真正美国人的呼声”。由此可见，美帝残暴的法西斯措施，绝不能阻止美国人民进步的趋势。第三、苦恼着美帝的物价跌风，近来已日紧一日，农产品价格自八、九两日再度狂跌后，已打破二月暴跌时的最低点。另一方面，各重工业部门的减产亦在开始，许多工厂已在减缩生产，并大批解雇工人。“这足以表明经济危机已愈益逼近”。（塔斯社）
    在欧洲，民主与帝国主义两个阵营之间，斗争极为激烈。美帝正亲自出马，通过伦敦三国会议和英、法、荷、比、卢五国会议，加紧实行“马歇尔计划”，及组织“西欧集团”的阴谋；并急于将意大利拉入这一集团中。但美帝及其英法走卒的这一疯狂企图，已遭有力反击。苏联政府已再度向美英法提出严重抗议；西欧各国的民主舆论也纷起谴责，德国人民一致表示“将绝不同意伦敦决议”；意大利人民为反对美帝爪牙加斯贝利卖国政府的斗争，正在高涨，并准备一切力量，要叫加斯贝利政府“于选举日在人民面前偿罪”。而美英工贼分裂世职阴谋的破产，乃是民主劳工阵营在反对“马歇尔计划”斗争中所赢得的第一会合的重大战果。必须指出：美帝所以急于要组成“西欧集团”，原来不是别的，恰恰是美帝外强中干的表现，它害怕本身愈益逼近的经济危机，恐惧欧洲民主阵营势力的日益壮大，且焦虑“一旦意共在大选中获胜，不仅美国要丧失其在欧洲的关键地点，而且将使西欧联盟和马歇尔计划不能实行”（塔斯社）的表现。据各方纷纷传说，英、法、卢、比、荷五国即将缔结军事同盟，以便以此为核心，进而组织“西欧集团”。但退一步说，即使“西欧集团”一旦组成，对于美帝及其走卒说来，只是一副更加不易挣脱的镣铐而已，因为所谓“西欧集团”，不仅是带有反苏反东欧新民主各国的性质，而且首先是把西欧变成美帝的殖民地与屯兵场，“供美国务院驱使”去奴役西欧人民，因此，结果必将使欧洲人民反对美帝及其走狗的正义运动，更加高涨起来。
    过去一周，希腊民主军继续胜利进军。击溃敌军一个师，歼敌三个营，获得空前大捷。使美帝扶植下的希腊保皇法西斯分子为之丧胆。“在广大人民拥护下，民主军反攻的规模已越来越大”（苏红星报）。在东南亚，菲共领导下的人民武装及全国农民协会，其力量日益增长，以致菲奸罗哈斯不得不公开承认其“戡乱攻势”已告失败，并无耻发布上述革命组织为“非法”的反动法令，充分表现其内心的畏惧。同样的，越共领袖胡志明领导下的人民游击队，虽在法帝优势兵力压迫下，亦更形壮大，越南广大腹地仍为越盟游击队与民主政权所控制。这连西贡法国军事发言人亦不得不供认：游击队力量“仍极强大”。南鲜争取统一独立与民主的运动亦在开展中，日前北鲜人民议会公布的朝鲜临时宪法草案，它已成为鼓舞朝鲜人民战斗的一面旗帜。（新华社）
