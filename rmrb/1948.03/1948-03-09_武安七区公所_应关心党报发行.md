　　Wu'an Seventh District Public Office
  　Should Pay Attention to Party Newspaper Distribution

　　To the Editors:

　　Wu'an Seventh District has a total of forty-nine villages, but the district only subscribes to five newspapers for the villages. Some village public offices want to subscribe, but they are afraid that the district's correspondents will not deliver them. The district public office has four correspondents specifically responsible for delivering documents and newspapers (supplied by the masses), but they are busy with the district's logistical work every day and are unwilling to handle party newspaper subscriptions. Even when newspapers arrive, they are not delivered on a fixed schedule. When the district accumulates too many newspapers and letters, they use villagers returning home to carry them, which makes it inconvenient for the villages to subscribe and read the newspapers. It is suggested that the Seventh District should be properly reorganized in the future, with a fixed schedule, to truly distribute the newspapers to all villages. Getting the newspapers to our rural readers on time is equivalent to helping the peasants to thoroughly liberate themselves. Party newspapers are indispensable in the land reform, and we must attach importance to promoting party newspapers in the future, and eliminate the past thinking of not caring about party newspapers.

### 武安七区公所　应关心党报发行

　　武安七区公所
  　应关心党报发行编辑同志：
    武安七区共有四十九个村，但区上只给村上代订五份报纸，有些村公所想订报，但怕区上通讯员不给送。区公所有四个通信员专负送信文件、报纸之责（群众供给），但他们每天都忙于区上勤务工作，送个紧急通知，对党报代订也不想代订。有了报也不固定时间往下送，区上报纸信件积压多了，就利用各村老乡往回捎，使村上订报看报都感到不便。建议七区今后要好好整顿一下，固定班期，要真正把报纸发行到各村。我们把报纸要按时送到农村读者手里，就等于帮助农民彻底翻身，党报是土改中不可缺少的东西，今后要把推广党报重视起来；把过去不关心党报的思想去掉。（张毅）
