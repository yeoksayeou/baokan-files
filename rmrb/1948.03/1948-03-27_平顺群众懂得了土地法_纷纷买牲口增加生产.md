　　【Taihang News】After the masses in the first and fourth districts of Pingshun County understood the Land Law, they invested their funds in production and purchased livestock to overcome the difficulties of labor and animal power in order to increase production. According to materials from six villages in the two districts, more than 40 head of livestock have been bought back and exchanged since the Lunar New Year. The masses in various villages of the county are generally buying livestock. When the masses in Anle Village, Fourth District, discussed increasing production, everyone suggested that relying solely on labor could not achieve the goal of increasing production, and that livestock should be increased to save labor and allow for more careful cultivation. Yue Qiwen, a new middle peasant, immediately said, "I earned 200,000 yuan from selling flowers and transportation last winter, and I will sell my old donkey and exchange it for a big mule." Influenced by him, middle and poor peasants signed up to contribute the money they earned from production last winter to buy livestock together. By the beginning of February, the whole village had bought 18 head of livestock (including 16 donkeys, 1 mule, and 1 cow), and exchanged 9 head of bad livestock for good ones. In Beitou Village, First District, in addition to the cooperative organizing blacksmiths and carpenters to repair agricultural implements, the masses also actively purchased livestock. At the meeting in Weizi Town, Lucheng, on January 25th, 27 middle and poor peasant households exchanged and bought back a total of 13 head of livestock, and Meng Cuncai, a new middle peasant, bought a large mule on his own. Everyone happily said: This year's spring plowing will not be difficult. In addition to providing loans to households lacking livestock to buy livestock and restoring the mule and horse fair to facilitate the transfer of livestock, the Second Special District Office has also sent people from cooperative, bank, and agricultural and forestry bureau to the Wutai area of ​​Jin-Chahar-Hebei to purchase livestock for the masses; the Third Special District Office also proposed that all localities should convene veterinary research meetings as soon as possible to prevent livestock diseases and deaths, and can continue to organize public cattle and donkey breeding to make livestock reproduce faster.

　　平顺群众懂得了土地法
  　纷纷买牲口增加生产
    【太行消息】平顺一、四区群众了解土地法后，为增加生产，纷纷将资金投入生产，购买牲口，以克服劳畜力困难。据两区六个村材料，过年后已买回和换回牲口四十余头。该县各村群众普遍购买牲口，四区安乐村群众在讨论增加生产时，大家提出光靠劳力是达不到增产数的，应该增加牲口，省出劳力来加工细作。新中农岳其文马上说：“我去冬卖花、运输赚了二十万块钱，要把我老驴卖了换个大骡子。”在他影响下，中贫农纷纷报名把去冬从生产赚的钱拿出来合伙买牲口，到二月初全村一共买了牲口十八头（内驴十六、骡牛各一）坏牲口换成好的九头。一区北头村除了由合作社组织铁匠炉和木匠修造农具外，群众也纷纷购买牲口，正月二十五潞城微子镇大会上，二十七户中贫农，一共倒换和买回了牲口十三头，新中农孟存财单独买了大骡子一头。大家高兴的说：今年春耕可不困难了，此外二专署除了贷款给缺乏牲口户买牲口和恢复骡马大会便利调剂牲口外，合作社、银行、农林局等机关已派人去晋察冀五台一带替群众购买牲口；三专署亦提出各地应及早召开兽医研究会，预防牲口疾病和死亡，并可继续组织公牛、驴配种，使牲口更快的繁殖。
