　　Using Democracy to Resolve Conflicts
    ——The Deepening of Party Rectification Work in Tian'erzhuang
    Using Reason Within the Party to Distinguish Truth from Falsehood
  　Mature Introspection Shows Sincerity in Acknowledging and Correcting Mistakes by Voluntarily Returning Gains
    No Arrogant Attitude, No Beating of People, Stressing Democracy to Resolve Conflicts
    
    [Our Dispatch] After the Tian'erzhuang Branch of the Ninth District of Wu'an was made public, party members with minor mistakes actively engaged in criticism and self-criticism, becoming the backbone of the Party rectification effort. At the first meeting of mass representatives, three party members were approved after review. Their mistakes were not serious, and their self-criticism was quick. A few days later, five more people were approved at a meeting of the Poor Peasants' League. By this time, the Poor Peasants' League had been established, and the eight approved party members had a strong aversion to the bad party members, leading to a tendency to "extract confessions." One day, Yang Yunfeng reflected on confiscating 312 silver dollars from a landlord, but there was no record. The former village chief, Yang Changquan, reflected on taking advantage of buying confiscated trees cheaply, but there was no record either. The eight party members questioned them in unison, saying that if the items were missing and there were no records, wasn't that embezzlement? Both men felt that there was "no way out" and tearfully admitted to "embezzlement." Duan Kuishan handed over 83 pearls he confiscated to Yang Yunfeng, but everyone didn't believe him, saying, "Are you really that clean?" Duan casually replied that he had embezzled 200 pearls. Yang Qingtian, the fruit custodian, had 45 silver dollars of his own. Initially, his explanation was inadequate, and other party members didn't believe him. He then made up a story, admitting that the 45 dollars were embezzled. After the branch meeting, some comrades casually discussed that Yang Qingtian had only confiscated 45 silver dollars as custodian, which had already been distributed, so his admission of embezzlement was false. Duan Kuishan's confiscation of pearls was witnessed by everyone, and there weren't 200. Then they felt that Yang Yunfeng and Yang Changquan's admissions of embezzlement were not "realistic." The work team convened a branch meeting, without calling Yunfeng, Changquan, and Kuishan to the meeting. Everyone presented the facts and studied them together. Yang Qingtian then said that because everyone was pressuring him, he was afraid that people would not believe him, so he had to admit to "embezzlement." With the help of comrades, he then revealed the detailed facts of his relative from Shidong giving him 38 yuan and his wife's milk money of seven yuan. He used this fact to educate the entire branch, explaining that ideological introspection cannot be forced, and we must focus on self-awareness. We should collect evidence before drawing conclusions, otherwise, there will be deviations. After the branch's "leftist" sentiment changed, the two comrades then told the truth. The work team also used this fact to educate the masses. The Poor Peasants' League Women's Group first clarified the issue of Yang Qingtian's silver dollars because they knew about Yang Qingtian's relative giving him the money. The branch and the masses jointly investigated the accounts and collected materials. Changquan's tree problem was also clarified. In this way, party members who made mistakes felt that there was "a way out," and the masses also changed their perception of the party members.

    The non-Party cadres who made mistakes, as well as Yang Yunfeng's brother Yuxian, Yang Changquan's brother Weiquan, and four others, faced many opinions from the masses. After the nine comrades in the branch were approved by the Poor Peasants' League, they helped comrades with bigger mistakes continue their self-criticism while helping the six others. Because the masses were mobilized sufficiently, and the party members' self-criticism was good, under this pressure and influence, they quickly reflected on their mistakes. Only Yang Yuxian did not do a good job of reflecting on protecting the landlord Yang Chunfa. The comrades used their own self-criticism of protecting Yang Chunfa to enlighten him and question him. After one day and two nights, he dared to admit his mistakes. The six also did self-criticism in the Poor Peasants' League and were approved after review.

    When the self-criticism was mature, party members and non-Party cadres were mobilized to voluntarily return the fruits of struggle obtained through embezzlement and cheap purchases, demonstrating practical action to the masses. The Poor Peasants' League and the Farmers' Association also discussed it. The masses' simple principles were worth learning. The unanimous opinion of the entire masses was that the fruits of embezzlement and theft should be returned unconditionally. For things that were "undemocratically bought" (i.e., bought cheaply when not sold publicly), they should first be returned, and then, based on their family circumstances, one-third to one-half of the items would be left for them as compensation. Regarding the issue of the excessive scores assigned to them during the fruit distribution, the masses did not discuss it, saying "let bygones be bygones". The branch took the lead in voluntarily returning all the fruits of "embezzlement," "seizure," and "undemocratic purchases." They contacted the Farmers' Association Committee and returned the first batch of over 400 pieces of clothing, bedding, silverware, etc. The second batch included one hundred or so large items such as farm tools and chests. The third batch included livestock, houses, and land (already self-reported, but not yet returned, and under careful study). Party member Yang Changquan said, "I feel much better after returning them!" The masses said, "Almost everything has been returned." Someone said, "The good stuff hasn't been taken out yet." The masses were still investigating and continuing to review and thoroughly reform their own farmhands.

    Under the family "rule" of Political Director's four brothers, three nephews, Village Chief's two brothers, and twenty or so other people in Tian'erzhuang, the masses suffered great oppression. Therefore, the masses asked the work team to hold a mass meeting so that they could answer on the spot, distinguish right from wrong, apologize, and admit mistakes. The work team, in principle, believed that the masses' demands were legitimate, but this meeting must not be the same as the past struggles against landlords in terms of ideology and method. That is to say, it must be democratic, reasonable, and must achieve the purpose of "resolving conflicts" (unity). To achieve this goal, there must be two prerequisites: first, the party members' self-criticism must be mature; second, the masses' class consciousness as "one family" must be mature. We met the first condition, and we needed to put in a lot of effort to meet the second condition. The Farmers' Association Committee consciously and automatically convened group meetings for male and female members, where they discussed the following questions: 1. Why did the Communist Party invite us to participate in the branch meeting to offer opinions and "communicate"? Was it to "patch up conflicts"? Or to "resolve conflicts"? 2. Are party cadres the same as landlords? Are we "one family"? 3. Is it good to beat people like in the past? Is it right? --The masses set their own discipline: do not take the wrong path, do not beat people, and do not adopt an arrogant attitude. The discussion of the "no beating people" issue was of great significance: first, not beating people was a concrete manifestation of the class consciousness of "one family"; second, it changed the old social bad habit of beating people at will, established a new order, launched serious mass criticism and self-criticism, and opposed beating and fining people; people who violated the law were handed over to the government for processing. However, Meng Quezi, a woman whose finger was broken, and Yang Huatang, a woman whose head was broken, firmly demanded that they had to beat the public security officer Duan Kuishan to vent their anger, and would not attend the meeting if they were not allowed to beat him. Because of the awakening of "one family," the masses patiently persuaded them with sympathy, and they were then persuaded to tell their grievances on the spot and teach their children. After this condition was mature, the branch congress opened. The men and women, old and young, of the new Farmers' Association had never participated in a congress so enthusiastically. At their request, it continued for two days and nights. Two women recounted their suffering. Yang Xiangzi questioned who the mastermind was behind the attempt to drag him and "throw him into the West Ditch" (to kill him) last year when struggling against the landlord Yang Chunfa. Honest new middle peasant Yang Qiushan first explained that "We are one family, and everything will be over once we say it" and then said that some cadres framed him by pressing charges. When he was detained, he was so scared that he almost died. His wife was afraid that he would die in someone else's house, but the cadres did not allow him to come out... After listening to these facts, many people cried. The comrades of the work team asked Duan Kuishan, "Are you sad? What mistakes have you made? How should you correct them?" Duan Kuishan apologized to the masses on the spot and, under the rebuke of his class conscience, slapped himself in the face. Yang Youming, a member of the Poor Peasants' League, grabbed his hand. The masses began to forgive him and asked for someone else to do self-criticism. After this batch of self-criticism, the masses offered opinions. After more self-criticism, they offered more opinions. If the answers were not correct or if they were trying to struggle against others, then they would receive more opinions. In the end, only Yang Xiangzi was still pursuing the root of the incident of wanting to "throw him into the West Ditch." The masses all said that he had already reflected on it and there was no need to ask further. Retired soldier Yang Ti made an unreasonable request to the old village chief Yang Changquan, saying that the village chief was responsible for his wife's divorce and wanted the village chief to compensate his wife. The masses criticized his selfishness. Under the masses' tears and teachings, the party members' consciousness was raised a step further, and they proposed compensation for damages and returning the fruits of struggle for past beatings, fines, and excessive housing and land gains. Finally, the party members and the masses all dispersed from the meeting with smiles on their faces.

    【本报消息】武安九区田二庄支部公开后，错误小的党员批评与自我批评，表现积极，成了党内整党的骨干分子。在第一次群众代表会上审查通过了三个党员，错误不很大反省也很快，不几天，在贫农团会上又通过了五人。这时贫农团已经建立起来，八个被通过的党员，对坏党员有厌恶情绪，发生“逼口供”的倾向。一天，杨云峰反省没收地主三百一十二元现洋，但是没有帐了。旧村长杨常全反省沾便宜买没收的树，也没了帐。八个党员齐声追问，没有了东西，又没有帐，不是贪污是什么？两人想无论如何，“没有出路了”，落着眼泪承认了“贪污”。段魁山没收八十三颗珠子交了杨云峰，但大家不相信，说：“难道你就这样干净”？段随口答复，我贪污了二百颗。果实保管员杨清田自己有四十五元现洋，开始理由说不周到，其他党员不信，他就自己编了一套，承认四十五元是贪污的。支部散会后，有几个同志漫谈，说杨清田当保管后只没收了四十五元现洋，已经分配了，他说贪污是假的。段魁山没收珠子大家都见了，没有二百颗。接着又感到杨云峰，杨常全的承认贪污都不“实际”。工作组召集支部开会，没有叫云峰、常全、魁山到会，大家提出事实，互相研究，杨清田才说出由于大家逼问，怕大家不信，只得承认“贪污”。在同志们的帮助下，他才说出石洞亲戚家给他三十八元及老婆奶孩子的七元的详细事实，并用此事实，教育了全支部，说明思想反省，不能硬逼，必须着重自觉，我们应当搜集证据，再下结论，不然就要出偏向。支部“左”的情绪转变之后，那二个同志也才说出了实话。工作组又拿这个事实教育了群众，贫农团妇女组首先弄清了杨清田现洋的问题，因为她们知道杨清田的亲戚给他现洋的事。支部与群众共同调查帐目，搜集材料，常全的树木问题也算清了。这样有错误的党员才感到“有了路”，群众也转变了对党员的认识。
    犯错误的非党干部及杨云峰的哥哥玉贤，杨常全的哥哥未全等六人，群众对他们意见很多。支部里九个同志为贫农团通过之后，即一面帮助错误较大的同志继续反省，一面帮助他们六个人。由于群众的发动较充分，党员反省较好，在这种压力与影响之下，他们很快的反省了自己的错误，只有杨玉贤对于包庇地主杨春发反省不好。同志们以自己包庇杨春发的反省启发他，质问他，一天两夜之后，他也敢于承认自己的错误。六个人也在贫农团里做了反省，审查通过了。
    反省成熟，即动员党员与非党干部自动退出贪污贱买的斗争果实，向群众作实际行动上的表现。贫农团与农会也作了讨论，群众的朴素的原则性是值得我们学习的。全体群众一致意见是贪污偷窃的果实一律退出，对于“不民主买”（即不是公开卖时贱买的）的东西先退出来，然后根据其家庭情况，斟情给他们留下三分之一到二分之一的东西，以为代价。对于他们分果实时所评的分数过高问题，群众均未加讨论，都说“大目了”就算了。支部对于贪污“强占”“不民主买”的果实，都自动的一律退出，他们与农会委员会接洽好了，第一批退衣服被褥、银器等，退出了四百余件。第二批退农具箱柜等大物百十件。第三批退牲口、房屋土地（已自报、现尚未退，正慎重研究）。党员杨常全说：“退出来心里就痛快了！”群众说“退的差不多了。”有人说：“好东西还没有拿出来哩。”群众对于自己的长工，还在调查研究继续审查，彻底改造。
    田二庄在政治主任四弟兄三外甥，村长两弟兄等二十来人的家族“统治”下，群众受过很大的压迫，因此，群众向工作组要求开群众大会。让他们当场答复辨明是非赔情认错。工作组在原则上认为群众的要求是正当的，但是这个会，必须从思想上及方式上和过去斗争地主不能有丝毫相同，这就是说，必须是民主，讲理，必须达到“解疙瘩”（团结）之目的。为达此目的，又必须有两个前提条件：第一、党员反省要成熟；第二、群众“一家人”的阶级自觉要成熟。第一个条件我们是具备了的，第二个条件要下大功夫去做。农会委员会自觉自动的召集男女会员开小组会，小组会上讨论了以下问题：一、共产党请咱们参加支部会提意见“通气”是为了啥？为了“挽疙瘩”？为了“解疙瘩”？二、党员干部与地主一样不一样？咱们是不是一家人？三、和过去一样打人好不好？对不对？——众自己定下纪律：不走错路，不打人，不动态度。对于“不打人”这个问题的讨论意义很大，一则不打人是“一家人”阶级自觉的具体表现；二则改变旧的社会随便打人的坏风气，树立新秩序，展开严肃的群众性的批评与自我批评，反对打人罚人；犯法的人送政府处理。但是被打断了手指的妇女孟缺子与被打破头的妇女杨华堂坚决要求非打公安员段魁山不能出气，不叫打即不参加会议。由于一家人的觉悟，群众同情的耐心的解劝之后，才说服了她们当场诉说自己的冤屈，教训自己的子弟。这一条件准备成熟之后，支部大会开幕了。新农会的男女老幼从来没有这样踊跃的参加大会，在他们要求下，连续开了两昼夜，两个妇女诉了苦。杨祥子质问去年斗争地主杨春发时，十余人要拖他“扔西沟”（捣死之意）的主谋人是谁？老实新中农杨秋山首先说明“咱们是一家子，话说出来就完了”之后，说到某些干部按赃陷害他，被扣时因害怕得病几乎死的时候，老婆怕他死在别人家里不好，但是干部又不允许出来………听了这些事实之后，好多人都哭了，工作组的同志问段魁山道：“你难过不难过？犯了什么错误？应该怎样改过？”段魁山给群众当场赔情，并在阶级良心的责备下，双手打起自己的脸来，贫农团委员杨友名抱住了他的手，群众开始对他原谅，要求另换别人作反省。这样一批反省之后，群众提出意见，再反省之后，再提，不对嘴、不斗争，越来意见越少，最后只剩下杨祥子还在追问要“扔他西沟”事件的根，群众都说人家已经反省过了不必再问。退伍军人杨梯向旧村长杨常全提出无理要求，说他老婆的离婚由村长负责，要村长赔他老婆。群众批评了他的自私自利。在群众一边落泪一边训教之下，党员觉悟再提高一步，对于过去打人罚人及多得房屋土地等等，纷纷提出赔偿损失，退出果实。最后，党员与群众都笑容满面的散了会。
