Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th:  According to comprehensive reports: Industry and commerce in various parts of the Chiang area are declining daily. Many factories in Hankou are reducing production and mainly operating daytime shifts. After the city's water and electricity company was forced to stop daytime power supply last month due to a coal shortage, most factories are facing a complete shutdown crisis. In Tianjin, the number of businesses closing down is increasing daily. Taking the restaurant industry as an example, out of the original 347 restaurants, more than 100 closed down before and after the Lunar New Year. Recently, the Chiang bandits doubled the "banquet tax." According to the new tax rate, even small restaurants selling twenty-five buns must pay 20,000 yuan in tax. This has made it impossible for restaurants that are barely managing to continue operating. At the beginning of this month, they submitted a serious protest to the Chiang bandit authorities. In Qingdao, a famous fish producing area, last year's fish catch decreased by one-third compared to pre-war levels, amounting to only over 21 million market catties, and the fish market is becoming increasingly depressed. In Baoding, the number of closed businesses reached more than 200 in the three months from last November to January this year. Even the shelves of the silk shops, cloth shops, and grocery stores that are still barely maintaining their operations are eight or nine tenths empty. In Kaifeng, due to the Chiang bandits' heavy and exorbitant taxes, more than 300 businesses have requested to close down because they cannot sustain operations. In Xuzhou, after the Chiang bandit authorities increased the business tax fourfold, hundreds of businesses closed down last month because they could not afford it. In Zhengzhou, the Chiang bandit authorities extort each business for one or two hundred million or more, making it impossible for merchants to bear the burden. At the beginning of last month, Hengxing, Hongyuan, Xinfu and other flower businesses successively declared bankruptcy.

　　蒋匪残暴向商民勒索捐税
  　蒋区工商业倒闭日多
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合各方消息：蒋区各地工商业日益凋敝。汉口各业工厂为减少生产，多开白天班，上月中该市水电公司因煤荒被迫停止白天供电后，大部工厂均已面临全部停业危机。天津各业商号歇业日多，以饭馆业为例，该业原有三百四十七家，旧历年前后倒闭歇业者共达百余家；近蒋匪又增加“筵席捐”两倍，按照新税率，连小饭馆卖二十五个包子亦须缴捐两万元，致尚在勉强开业的饭馆亦已无法继续支持，遂于本月初向蒋匪当局提出严重抗议。著名鱼产区青岛，去年度捕鱼量较战前锐减三分之一，仅二千一百余万市斤，渔市场已日见萧条。保定歇业商号，自去年十一月至今年一月三个月中，已达二百余家，即现在尚勉强维持之各缎店、布庄、杂货庄等之货架，亦均已十空八、九。开封各业商号在蒋匪繁重苛捐勒索下，因不堪维持要求歇业者已达三百余家之多。徐州自蒋匪当局增加营业税四倍后，上月中各业商号因无力负担，倒闭者已达数百家。郑州蒋匪当局对各商号之勒索，动辄在一、两亿以上，致商民均感不堪负担，上月初已有恒兴、宏源、信孚等花行先后宣告歇业。
