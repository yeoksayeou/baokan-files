　　Huangya Political Director Acts Recklessly
  　Door-to-Door Property Registration Causes Unrest in the Whole Village
    [Ping Shun Office Bulletin] Comrade Chunxi wrote: "On the seventeenth of this month, when I went from the district to the Shiyaotan sub-district to convey work instructions, I passed through Huangya. Ronggui, the village chief of that village, told me that Ma Chenshui, the political director of his village, led more than thirty people to register the property of each household in the village across all classes. When they went to the home of Cheng Daoquan, a middle peasant, they also rummaged through boxes and cabinets and confiscated the pictures on the wall and a portrait of Chairman Mao from a book in his house. This caused unrest among the masses in the whole village. According to the village chief, he had discussed this matter in the district, but unfortunately, the leaders of the district did not pay attention to it. According to the village chief, the political director of Huangya village has occupied too much fruit; his family has been allocated two courtyards of houses, which the masses are very dissatisfied with."
    The bulletin said: The political director of Huangya Village, in order to cover up his over-occupation of fruits, registered the property of the whole village, causing unease among all classes. This reckless action is adding mistakes to mistakes. We suggest that the leaders of the Seventh District should immediately stop it and hold him accountable.
    [Ping Shun News] Qingcaoao in the Third District of Ping Shun held a meeting of poor peasants, male and female, on the nineteenth of this month to discuss how to protect the Land Law and how to prevent landlords from destroying, wasting, decentralizing and transferring property. Five said: "We must do our own business, and we must manage our own things." Shi Huailiang said: "If the landlord wastes one, we will have one less." In the discussion, everyone unanimously demanded the establishment of a supervision and inspection team, and twelve poor peasants (male and female) were elected on the spot as inspectors, and poor peasants Shi Guizhen and Shi Huailiang were elected as the leader and deputy leader. Finally, everyone put forward five slogans: (1) Everyone inspects and everyone manages; (2) No selfishness, no sheltering; (3) Improve vigilance and prevent landlords from luring and buying; (4) Oppose sheltering landlords; (5) Resolutely do not act as an air-raid shelter for landlords.
    On the 20th, the supervision and inspection team held a meeting to discuss the division of labor, arrange work, and stipulate a system: report once every three days, arrange work once, and report temporarily if there are special problems. In order to facilitate the inspection, the twelve people were divided into three groups, each with a group leader. (Ben Zhong)

　　黄崖政治主任瞎胡闹
  　挨门登记财产引起全村不安
    【平顺办公室通报】据春喜同志来信：“我于本月十七日由区到石窑滩小区传达工作时，路过黄崖。该村村长荣贵同志谈他村政治主任马辰水，领三十余人在村各阶层挨户登记财产，到中农程道全家里，也是翻箱倒柜，并没收了他家墙上的画子和一本书上的毛主席像。因此引起全村群众不安。据村长说：他在区上谈过这件事，可惜区的领导上也对此没有注意。黄崖政治主任据该村村长说是多占果实，他一家分了两院房，群众很不满意”。
    通报说：黄崖村政治主任为了掩盖自己多占果实，登记全村财产，引起了各阶层的不安，这种胡闹行动正是错上加错，我们提议七区领导上应该马上制止并追究责任。
    【平顺消息】平顺三区青草凹，于本月十九日召开男女贫雇会议，讨论了如何保护土地法，如何防止地主破坏浪费、分散和转移财产。五则说：“自己的事总得自己来干，自己的东西总得自己来管”。史怀良说：“地主浪费一个，咱就要少一个的”。在讨论中，大家一致要求成立监督巡查小组，当场选出贫雇（男女）十二人为巡查员，并选贫雇史贵贞、史怀良二人为正副组长。最后大家提出五个口号：（一）人人巡查人人管理；（二）不自私不包庇；（三）提高警惕性，防止地富拉拢收买。（四）反对包庇地主；（五）坚决不给地主当防空洞。
    二十日，监督巡查小组开会，讨论分工，布置工作，并规定了制度是：三天汇报一次，布置一次工作，如有特殊问题，临时汇报。为便利巡查，将十二人划编为三个小组，每组设有小组长。（本中）
