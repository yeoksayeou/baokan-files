    ★The Taihang District Party Committee organized five work groups, totaling more than 180 people, and under the personal guidance of the District Party Committee, went to five counties, namely Anyang, Ci County, She County, Bo'ai, and Changzhi, to carry out filling, party rectification, and the democratic movement. The approach is to first work in a few villages, then expand from the district to the entire county, obtaining good methods to promote the entire Taihang District. Before the work groups went down, the District Party Committee told them that when working, they must rely on poor and hired peasants, unite with middle peasants, and consult with the common people in everything.
    ★The Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei (i.e., Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei) Liberated Area held its first high-level cadre meeting, which had excellent discussions on land reform, party rectification, armed construction, and other issues, and will greatly contribute to the future construction of the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Liberated Area. General Chen Geng called on everyone at the meeting to continue to annihilate more Chiang Kai-shek troops and vigorously carry out land reform. The troops in the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Liberated Area were sent out from our border region in the autumn of last year. Many of our border region comrades are there, and they are very united with the local people. In five months, they have annihilated many Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the reactionary armed forces of the landlords. The oppressed poor people have begun to turn themselves around, and the liberated area is becoming more and more consolidated.
