【Yushe News】 The Yushe County has organized eight work groups, which have gone to eight villages respectively to carry out democratic replenishment and party rectification. These villages are considered to be larger villages in Yushe, each with more than 300 households. Recently, the County Committee made a preliminary review of the work of the past twenty-five days. The details are as follows:

In the stage of organizing poor and lower-middle peasants, the work groups took many detours. Each village spent half a month, or even twenty days, to organize the Poor Peasants' League (all second-category villages). The main reason was that they underestimated the level of awareness of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and some did not believe in them. They did not understand that after years of campaigns in these areas, the political awareness of the poor and lower-middle peasants had been greatly improved. In the past, it was not that they were not aware, but the bureaucratic style of leadership and the ruling style of the village branch caused their superficial depression. The work groups did not realize this, so they did not combine public mobilization with individual visits, but instead secretly visited the poor and lower-middle peasants with a timid attitude. The poor and lower-middle peasants called the comrades of the work group "cadres of the rectification team" and "inspection team," and said, "This group of cadres is not bad, but I don't know what they will do in the future" (meaning they are not trying to understand the situation). Sometimes, the comrades of the work group spent eight or nine days repeatedly examining seven or eight poor and lower-middle peasants, which hurt their enthusiasm. In Taoyang Village, some poor and lower-middle peasants said, "It was like this before, and it is still the same as before" (meaning: it is the same as organizing poor and lower-middle peasants during production in the past, organizing them just to have a name and then nothing happens). During the visits to poor and lower-middle peasants, some comrades became greatly suspicious when they encountered some shortcomings of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thinking that they were all unreliable, and did not analyze the shortcomings of individuals from the essence of the class. In fact, even if there are some minor shortcomings, once the poor and lower-middle peasants are mobilized, they will express their determination to resolutely overcome them, saying, "I used to visit other people's houses, and I joined the League, I will definitely change, otherwise people will look down on us." In addition, under the same erroneous understanding, there was also a tendency to take over everything. When the comrades of the work group went to the countryside, they were determined to go deep into the masses and mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants and middle peasants, which was very good. But it should be to raise their awareness and let them stand up to be masters of their own affairs, not to take over everything. However, some comrades even became the leaders of the poor peasants' groups themselves, which was completely wrong.

On the issue of dealing with the old organizations, there were also biases. In the early stage of work, it was believed that all the old organizations in the second-category villages were unusable. At the same time, they were afraid of contacting the old organizations and causing suspicion among the masses. After only asking them for the lists of poor and lower-middle peasants, they were all discarded and ignored. Moreover, they had a sense of disgust towards them. As a result, this further promoted the old organizations' antagonism towards the leadership. They believed that it was not that the masses did not want them, but that the leadership did not want them. Some party members who had made major mistakes used words such as "cadres have no end" and "the leadership doesn't want them anymore" to deceive comrades who had made minor mistakes or even no mistakes. Some comrades who had joined the party not long ago and had a good relationship with the masses said, "I just have two more characters (party members). My things (referring to fruits) are not more than those who can participate in the Poor Peasants' League." Zhao Naixian of Tan Village said, "If I had known this, I shouldn't have joined the party." Precisely because the policy of striving for education and transformation was not adopted for the old organizations, and good party members were not relied upon as the backbone to educate and transform other people with mistakes, but instead they were all discarded and treated equally, forming a stalemate, and some collapsed. Yun Cuo ××× said, "Since the work group told us to stop activities, we feel that this is very good, there are no meetings, and we can go to bed early at night, just waiting for the people's court to deal with us!" On the other hand, this has fueled the masses' blind anti-cadre and anti-party member sentiment. Originally, the poor and lower-middle peasants did not blindly exclude them and prevent them from participating in the Poor Peasants' League; on the contrary, they eagerly demanded that party members review the shortcomings of the branch, express their attitudes, and admit and correct their mistakes. They said, "To retreat the troops of Eastern Wu, you still need the people of Eastern Wu." However, the work group's approach violated the demands of the masses.

The public review of party members by the branch was carried out after the Poor Peasants' League was organized. There are two benefits to doing this: First, the process of organization is also a process of discovering problems (democratic replenishment problems) and concentrating problems. After the problems are concentrated, the masses' thinking is more mature and they are prepared for party rectification. Second, the branch has also undergone deliberation and a short period of criticism and self-criticism, and is ideologically prepared to accept the review of the masses. This is what Tan Village did. After the Poor Peasants' League was organized in the village, representatives were selected and some middle peasant representatives were also absorbed (after deliberation among the middle peasants) to participate in the branch meeting. Later, several more masses who had opinions on party members and cadres were also absorbed to participate in the branch meeting, reaching more than 110 people, and 19 party members. In this way, the masses had a sense of ownership. Mao Taiming knew that in the future, the branch party members would be supervised by the masses, and he said, "This requires us to rectify ourselves well!" Everyone spoke enthusiastically. The party members also felt that no mistakes could be concealed, and they were determined to thoroughly reflect. (Yushe County Committee)

### 榆社工作组相信贫雇不够　缩手缩脚拖延时间  一律撇开老组织不是群众真要求

　　榆社工作组相信贫雇不够
  　缩手缩脚拖延时间
    一律撇开老组织不是群众真要求
    【榆社消息】榆社组织了八个工作组，分别到八个村进行填补民主与整党。这些村庄，在榆社说来都是较大的，每村有三百多户。最近县委会将二十五天来的工作作了初步检讨。现分述如下：
    在组织贫雇阶段，工作组走了不少弯路。每个村都是前后费了半个月，甚至二十天时间，才把贫农团组织起来（都是二类村）。主要原因是对贫雇觉悟程度估计过低，有些不相信他们。不了解这些地区，经过多年运动，贫雇政治觉悟已相当提高。以前不是他们不觉悟，而是由于领导上的官僚主义与村支部统治作风，造成他们表面上的消沉。工作组没有认识这一点，因此没有把公开发动与个别访问相结合，而是小手小脚地在暗访贫雇。贫雇称工作组同志为“整风队干部”、“检查团”；并说：“这批干部倒不错，就是不知将来要作成啥”（意思不摸底）。工作组同志，有时能用八、九天时间，翻来复去审查七、八个贫雇，有伤他们的热情。在桃阳村有些贫雇就说：“以前就是如此，现在还和以前一样”（意思就是说：和以前在生产时组织贫雇一样，组织起来挂个名就没事了）。访贫雇中，有些同志遇到贫雇有些毛病，就大大发生了怀疑，认为都不可靠，没有从阶级本质上来分析个别人的毛病。实际上，即使有些小毛病，一经把贫雇发动起来后，他们就表示要坚决克服，说：“我以前串过门子，入了团，我一定改，不改人家就瞧不起咱来。”此外，在同一错误认识下，又产生了包办代替偏向。工作组同志下乡时，都决心深入群众，发动贫雇和中农，这是很好的。但应该是提高他们的觉悟，让他们自己起来当家作主，不能包办代替。可是有的同志，竟自己当了贫雇组长，这是完全错误的。
    在对待老组织问题上，也曾发生过偏向，工作初期，认为二类村老组织全都不能用，同时怕与老组织发生联系，引起群众怀疑，只是向他们要出贫雇名单后，一律撇开，不理他们。而且对他们生了厌恶之心。这样结果，更促成了老组织对领导上的对抗，他们认为这不是群众不要他们，而是领导上不要他们。一些错误大的党员，就用“干部没下场”、“领导上不要了”等话语欺骗错误小的、甚至没错误的同志。有些同志本来入党不久，而且和群众的关系也很不错，自己受到这样待遇，说：“我就是多了两个字（党员）。我的东西（指果实）比上能参加贫农团的也不多”。潭村赵乃仙说：“早知道这样，不该入党来。”正由于对老组织不是采取争取教育改造方针，不是依靠好党员当骨干，教育改造其他有错误的，而是一律撇开同等着待，形成僵局，有的躺倒了。云簇×××说：“自从工作组告说停止活动，咱觉这可好来，会不开啦，黑夜也能早睡啦，就是等上人民法庭对啦！”另方面，由此助长了群众盲目反干部反党员情绪。本来贫雇并不是盲目排斥他们，不让他们参加贫农团；相反的，而是急要求党员检讨支部缺点，表明自己态度，认错改错。他们说：“要退东吴兵，还得东吴人”。而工作组的作法，却是违反群众要求的。
    公开支部审查党员，是在贫农团组织起来后进行的。这样做有两个好处：一、组织过程也是发现问题（民主填补问题），集中问题的过程，把问题集中起来后，群众思想也较成熟，有了整党的准备。二、在支部方面，也经过酝酿，进行过一个短期批评与自我批评，在思想上有了接受群众审查的准备。潭村就是这样做的。该村贫农团组织起来后，选出代表，并吸收一部分中农代表（在中农里也经过酝酿）参加支部会议。以后又吸收几个对党员干部有意见的群众都参加支部会，到群众一百一十多人，党员十九人。这样，群众有了主人翁感觉，毛太明知道往后支部党员都要群众来监督，他说：“这就要往好整哩！”大家发言也踊跃了。党员也感到任何错误都隐瞒不了，下决心彻底反省。（榆社县委会）
