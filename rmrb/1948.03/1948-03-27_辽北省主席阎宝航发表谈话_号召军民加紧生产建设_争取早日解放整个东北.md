Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th -- Liaobei Provincial Chairman Yan Baohang recently issued a statement regarding the liberation of the entire Liaobei Province, stating: "The complete annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Siping is a sign that all of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the entire Northeast will be wiped out cleanly, and the liberation of the entire Liaobei Province is the harbinger of the liberation of the entire Northeast. This great victory not only demonstrates the growing strength of the People's Liberation Army militarily, but more importantly, it demonstrates that the united front of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people and democrats under the leadership of the Communist Party is certain to achieve final victory quickly. The five million people of Liaobei have made tremendous contributions to the war over the past two years and have obtained the fruits of victory they deserve. This fruit is that the people of our entire province have completely broken away from the reactionary rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. Therefore, the people of Liaobei are particularly jubilant for the great victory in Siping and its recovery." Chairman Yan further pointed out: "Although our entire Liaobei Province has been liberated, we still have trapped enemies to be annihilated in the left in Changchun and Shenyang, and the Beining Line, which is a vital communication line between Chiang Kai-shek's bandits inside and outside the pass, to the south. Therefore, since we are in such an important strategic position, we must directly shoulder the major task of supporting the war. We must actively carry out production and construction to enrich the material foundation of the war." To this end, Chairman Yan called on: "The military and civilians of the entire province should make persistent efforts, strengthen all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces, and unite, consolidate, and expand the foundation of victory. Now that the vernal equinox has passed, and the ice has melted, we should immediately mobilize all forces in urban and rural areas under the slogan of mass production by the whole people, quickly prepare for and carry out spring plowing, launch competitions, create a vigorous mass production movement, and ensure that all cultivated land is planted, increasing grain production by 75,000 tons. In the cities, we should actively produce and prosper the economy under the government's policy of protecting and developing national industry and commerce. All people who are anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war should unite more closely and fight together in the direction of striving for greater victory and striving for the early liberation of the entire Northeast and the entire China."

　　辽北省主席阎宝航发表谈话
    号召军民加紧生产建设　
    争取早日解放整个东北
    【新华社东北二十四日电】辽北省主席阎宝航顷就辽北省全境解放发表谈话称：“四平蒋匪的全部覆灭是全部东北蒋匪将被干净消灭的预兆，辽北全境的解放，则是东北全境解放的先声。此一伟大胜利，不仅在军事上说明人民解放军力量的日益强大，更重要的是说明了在共产党领导下的一切反帝反封建的人民与民主的统一战线是一定而且很快就要获得最后的胜利。我辽北五百万人民两年来对战争作了巨大的贡献，已获得了应有的胜利果实。这个果实就是我们全省的人民从此完全脱离了卖国贼蒋介石匪帮的反动统治。因此辽北人民为四平的大捷与收复而特别狂欢。”阎主席继指出：“我辽北省虽全境获得解放，但左有长（春）沈（阳）待歼的困敌，南为蒋匪关内外联系要冲的北宁线，所以我们既处于战略上如此重要的地位，就必须直接担负起重大的支援战争的任务。积极进行生产建设，充实战争的物质基础。”至此阎主席号召：“全省军民应再接再厉，加强一切反帝反封建力量，团结巩固与扩大胜利的基础。目前春分已过，冰融地解，应该立即在全民大生产的口号下，动员城乡一切力量，迅速准备与进行春耕，展开竞赛，造成轰轰烈烈的大生产运动，保证全部耕地种上，增产粮食七万五千吨的任务。城市中应在政府保护、发展民族工商业的方针下，积极生产，繁荣经济。一切反帝反封建反蒋介石卖国内战的人们，都应在争取更大胜利，争取早日解放全东北与全中国的方向下更紧密的团结一致，共同奋斗。”
