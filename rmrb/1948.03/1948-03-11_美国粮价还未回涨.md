　　US Grain Prices Have Not Rebounded
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th] New York dispatch: Since the sharp drop in US grain prices in early February, although there have been several fluctuations, they have not yet returned to their original state. According to a United Press dispatch on the 4th, grain prices have only recovered to 50% of the drop since the crash. However, statistics from the New York Journal of Commerce show that there has not been that much of a rebound. The New York stock market, which has always been sensitive, is still fluctuating. After a slight rebound in stock prices on the 1st, a general decline occurred again on the 5th, and "the volume of securities traded was the lowest since last September" (Associated Press). The United States now has a large surplus of grain. According to Secretary of Agriculture Anderson's estimate last September, even after a large amount of grain exports this spring, there will still be a surplus of 250 million bushels of wheat. Therefore, in the 36-nation wheat agreement signed by the United States in Washington on the 5th, it was decided to dump wheat abroad at a low price. The agreement stipulates that the United States, Canada, and Australia will export 500 million bushels of wheat annually, with a maximum price of two US dollars per bushel and a minimum of only one and a half US dollars. This maximum price is about 50 cents lower than the current average price in the United States, and more than one dollar lower than before the crash.

　　美国粮价还未回涨
    【新华社陕北九日电】纽约讯：美国粮价自二月上旬演成暴跌以来，虽经数度摆动，但迄未恢复原状。据合众社四日电：粮价现仅恢复至暴跌以来所跌落的百分之五十，但纽约商务杂志的统计，则显示没有回涨这么多，一向感觉灵敏的纽约证券市场，近仍在飘摇波动之中。该市证券价格在一日略为回涨后，五日又发生普遍下跌，“成交证券是去年九月来最少的一次”（美联社）。美国现在存粮很多，据农长安德逊去年九月的估计，今年春季即使在大量粮食输出之后，仍将有二亿五千万蒲式尔小麦过剩。因此，美国于五日在华府签字的三十六国小麦协定中，决定贱价向外倾销，其中规定美、加、澳三国每年输出五亿蒲式尔小麦，每蒲式尔最高价格二美元，最低仅一元半。此种最高定价较美国目前平均价格约低五角，较暴跌前低一元以上。
