Overcoming Rural Turmoil

Jin Lu, Xing Yi

Since the party rectification and study in Shahe County, six work teams were organized and dispatched to thirty villages to carry out party rectification, democracy, and filling positions. In addition, a propaganda team was organized to go to the countryside to publicize the Outline Land Law and mobilize the masses to concentrate on production. After more than twenty days of publicity, it was found that there was a serious state of chaos in various villages. In Zhongguan Village, fake poor peasant groups, under the pretext of production, borrowed 480,000 yuan from 24 middle-peasant households (including 7 new middle-peasant households). Individual middle peasants who could not pay the loan were forced to sell their cattle. In Dongmazhuang and Siliu villages, all the shares of the cooperatives were confiscated and turned into poor peasant shares. In Ximazhuang, the fake poor peasant groups withdrew all the middle peasant shares from the cooperative for lavish eating and drinking. Middle peasants in various villages once rushed to withdraw their shares, and the activities of the cooperatives generally ceased. Even the old custom of peasants giving each other a few steamed buns as gifts on the fifteenth day of the first month was confiscated. When a poor peasant's mother in a certain village was dying and wanted to exchange her trees for a coffin, the director of the poor peasant group did not allow it. Later, she discussed it with the poor peasant group but it was not resolved. This poor peasant said that when his mother died, he could not even get a coffin, and as soon as he acted, he was accused of undermining the Outline Land Law. For a short period in Shahe, buying and selling could not be done, and women's textile production was also largely stopped. There was almost no economic activity in the countryside, forming a serious phenomenon of "middle peasants waiting to be leveled, and poor peasants waiting to be divided," with no intention of living their lives. According to preliminary statistics from the county committee, the area of spring famine this year accounts for about half of the county. This serious chaotic situation has caused great harm to the masses. The leadership of Shahe discovered this problem and has now changed the propaganda team into a production work team, both publicizing to stabilize the people's emotions and leading the masses to carry out spring plowing, so that the chaotic situation has been gradually overcome.

Checking the reasons for this chaos, the main reason is that since the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, the new leading institutions have not yet been determined, and bad village cadres and fake poor peasant groups manipulated by bad village cadres have taken advantage of the gap in which the masses have not fully understood the true spirit of the Outline Land Law, attempting to please the poor peasants by harming the interests of the middle peasants and reduce their mistake of over-occupying the fruits of labor. On the other hand, they attempted to create "great chaos in the world" in order to obstruct thorough and complete redistribution, resulting in serious damage to the interests of the poor and middle peasants and causing widespread chaos, waste, and panic. To correct this chaos, Shahe has promulgated five measures to correct the chaotic situation in cooperatives (published in the People's Daily on March 15). In addition, the leadership should quickly organize propaganda teams to correctly explain the Outline Land Law and the proclamation of "whoever cultivates it, harvests it" issued by the Border Region Government (published in the People's Daily on March 11), stabilize the people's emotions, and start spring plowing to avoid economic chaos and spring famine in the cooperatives. When the Shahe propaganda team publicized the Outline Land Law in the sixth district, the women said: If we had known this method earlier, we would have wasted less food. When the Lvshuichi Village heard the publicity on the Land Law, the middle peasants not only did not withdraw their shares, but also rounded up the odd amounts and invested 200,000 yuan in shares. A middle peasant in Xinzhuang stopped building the house he wanted to build before the propaganda team went to the countryside. After hearing the publicity, he immediately started building the house again, which shows the importance of propaganda work.

Regarding the question of how to organize production leading institutions in villages where no filling positions or party rectification work is being carried out, according to Shahe's experience, during this transitional period, people who are upright, able to serve the masses, have a democratic style, work hard for many years, have production experience, and have prestige among the masses should be selected from the old village cadres and poor peasants (middle peasants who meet the conditions should also be paid attention to and absorbed - Editor) to form a production committee. The main task of the production committee is to lead the masses to produce and overcome famine, and maintain social order. This temporary leading institution has a great role. On the one hand, it can lead production, and on the other hand, it can prevent the sabotage of bad elements.

Editor's Note: The above-mentioned situations and problems in Shahe written by Comrades Jin Lu and Xing Yi are indeed an important issue at present. We have also received many similar manuscripts, indicating that this situation is not limited to Shahe County. It is hoped that the leadership of various places will pay attention to it, and the methods and experience of Shahe can be used as a reference for various places.

　　克服农村动荡不安现象
    晋鲁·邢毅
    沙河县自整党学习后，组织六个工作队分赴三十个村进行整党、民主、填补工作，另外组织宣传队下乡宣传土地法大纲并动员群众安心生产。经过二十余日的宣传，发现各村普遍存在严重的混乱现象：中关村假贫雇团借口生产，向廿四户中农（内新中农七户）借款四十八万元，个别中农交不上款被逼把牛卖掉。东马庄、四流两村，没收合作社全部股金，变为贫农股金。西马庄假贫农团，将合作社中农股金全部抽出大吃大喝。各村中农曾一度纷纷抽股，合作社普遍的停止活动，甚至正月十五日农民之间的旧习惯彼此几个馍馍的送礼，也被没收。某村贫农的母亲快死时，要把自己的树换口棺材，贫雇团主任不允许，后来和贫雇商量也未得解决，这个贫农说，母亲死了连口棺材也弄不到，一动就说破坏土地法大纲。沙河有一个短时期买卖不能作，妇女纺织也大部停止，几乎乡村中没有任何经济活动，形成“中农等平、贫农等分”，无心思过时光的严重现象。根据县委会的初步统计，今年春荒面积约占全县之半，这种严重的混乱情况，给予群众的危害极大。沙河领导上发现了这个问题，现已改宣传队为生产工作队，一面宣传安定群众情绪，一面领导群众进行春耕，混乱现象才得到逐渐克服。
    检查造成这种混乱的原因，主要是自土地法大纲颁布后，新的领导机构尚未确定，坏村干与被坏村干所操纵的假贫农团钻空子，利用了群众尚未完全了解土地法大纲真精神的空隙，企图以损害中农利益取欢于贫农，减轻其多占果实的错误。另方面企图造成“天下大乱”，予彻底平分以障碍，结果严重的损害了中贫农利益，造成普遍的混乱、浪费与恐慌。纠正这种混乱的办法，沙河已颁布纠正合作社混乱现象五条办法（载三月十五日人民日报），另外，领导上应迅速组织宣传队，正确讲解土地法大纲和边区政府颁布的“谁种谁收”的布告（载三月十一日人民日报），安定群众情绪，着手春耕，以免造成合作社经济上的混乱和春荒。沙河宣传队在六区宣传土地法大纲时，妇女们说：要早知道这样办法也少浪费点粮食。绿水池村听到土地法的宣传，中农不仅不抽股，还把零数找成整数入股金二十万元。新庄一个中农在宣传队未下乡之前要修盖的房子停止修盖，听到宣传后，立刻又重新盖房，这说明宣传工作的重要。
    现在不进行填补整党工作的村庄，如何组织生产领导机构问题，根据沙河的经验，在这个过渡时期，应从旧村干与贫雇中（中农合条件的也应注意吸收——编者）选择为人正派，能为群众服务，作风民主，长年劳动，有生产经验和在群众中有威信的人来组成生产委员会。生委会的主要任务是领导群众生产渡荒，维持社会秩序，这种临时性质的领导机构作用是很大的，一方面可以领导生产，同时也可防止坏分子的破坏。
    编者按：晋鲁、邢毅两同志写来以上沙河这些情况和问题，确是当前一个重要的问题，我们也收到不少这样类似的稿件，说明这情况不仅沙河一县。希各地领导上予以注意，沙河的办法和经验可供各地参考。
