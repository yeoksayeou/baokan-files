Jinnan District Party Committee Directly Subordinate Organs Organization Work Group
Goes to the Countryside to Carry Out Land Reform and Party Consolidation

[This newspaper report] After the Jinnan District Party Committee directly subordinate organs completed Party consolidation, in order to carry out the movement of Party consolidation, democracy, replenishment, and equal distribution, more than 400 Party member and non-Party member cadres were selected from various organs for intensive training. Starting from February 20th, they studied for nearly a month. Now it has ended, and two work groups for Wei County and Linqing have been organized. Wei County is led by Political Commissar Wang, Comrades Guo Sen, and Xi Congzhen. Linqing is personally led by Comrade Wang Renzhong. They went to the countryside one after another to help hundreds of thousands of working farmers in these two counties to stand up.

During the month, everyone studied the Land Law Outline, the organizational line, the mass line, and class division. Later, they studied Minister Nie's report from the Central Bureau on Wei County's Dongcun's experience in organizing poor peasant associations, consolidating the Party, and promoting democracy, which made everyone more clear about following the mass line and inspired everyone to have a meticulous work style and a down-to-earth attitude after going to the countryside. Finally, they studied the Central Committee's instructions on the work in old, semi-old, and new areas. In the study, they combined it with the specific situation in Jinnan, corrected the past simple method of dividing type areas based only on impressions, and all believed that distinguishing areas by village according to the specific situation was very correct. At the same time, they also believed that this was a very complex and arduous task, urgently requiring investigation and research and a precise and meticulous work style.

In the study of each of the above issues, everyone was very at ease and also very nervous, clarified many issues, and also raised many new issues for the leadership. On the 16th of this month, the study ended, and Comrade Wang Renzhong made a concluding report. In addition to talking about specific policies, work guidelines, and work methods, he also answered questions raised by the comrades, such as the difference between landlords and rich peasants, the difference between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, how to calculate exploitation, the time when landlords and rich peasants changed their status, whether women's half labor is counted as labor, and the explanation of feudal exploitation and capitalist exploitation.

He also put forward the work style that everyone should have after going to the countryside. He said: "First, learn from the masses with an open mind, first be a student, then be a teacher, and oppose the viewpoint of looking down on the masses and thinking that oneself is an omnipotent 'savior.' Second, life must be hard, must be mass-oriented, and live with the masses. Do not easily believe the one-sided words of a few people, but understand the situation, analyze and research, and compare in many ways. Do not be bought off, do not take small advantages, do not lose your temper with the basic masses, and do not beat or scold people. Third, help cultivate local cadres and worker-peasant cadres well, do not show off, learn from their strengths, and also criticize their mistakes. The cadres of the work group should also talk about unity and not engage in factionalism. Fourth, be loyal and honest, do not make false reports, writing newsletters cannot be empty talk, write facts, do not exaggerate, and do not write your own ideas and practices as the ideas and practices of the masses."

　　冀南区党委直属机关组织工作团
  　下乡进行土改整党
    【本报消息】冀南区党委直属机关整党结束后，为开展整党、民主、抽补、平分运动，特从各机关抽调党员与非党员干部四百来人，进行集训，从二月二十日开始，学习将近一月，现已结束，组织了威县、临清两个工作团，威县由王政委、郭森同志、习从真同志领导，临清由王任重同志亲自带领，先后下乡，帮助这两县数十万劳动农民翻身。一个月中，大家学习了土地法大纲、组织路线、群众路线、划阶级，后又学习了中央局聂部长报告的威县董村组织贫农团、整党、民主的经验，使大家对走群众路线更明确了，也启发了大家，下乡后要有细致的工作作风，老老实实的态度。最后，学习中央关于老区、半老区、新区的工作指示，学习中结合了冀南具体情形，纠正了过去只凭印象划分类型区的简单干法，都认为按具体情形以村为单位来区别地区很对，同时也认为这是个很复杂艰苦的工作，急需要调查研究，精密细致的工作作风。在以上每个问题的学习中，大家都很安心，也很紧张，明确了不少问题，也给领导上提出了不少新问题。本月十六日，学习结束，王任重同志作总结报告，除讲了具体政策、工作方针和工作方法，又解答了同志们提出的地主富农的区别、富农和富裕中农的区别、怎么算剥削、地主富农下降变成份的时间、妇女半劳力是不是算劳力、封建剥削和资本主义剥削的解释等问题。还向大家提出下乡后应有的工作作风，他说：“第一、虚心向群众学习，先当学生，后当先生，看不起群众，认为自己万能‘救世主’观点都要反对。第二、生活要艰苦，要群众化，和群众生活在一块，不要轻易相信片面的少数人的话，要了解情况，分析研究，多方对照。不要受人收买，不要沾小便宜，不准向基本群众发脾气，不准打人骂人。第三、好好帮助培养本地干部、工农干部，不能出风头，学习他们的长处，也要批评他们的错误。工作团的干部也要讲团结，不准闹宗派。第四、要忠诚老实，不要作假报告，写通讯不能客里空，写事实，不能夸大，不能把自己的想法作法，写成群众的想法和作法。
