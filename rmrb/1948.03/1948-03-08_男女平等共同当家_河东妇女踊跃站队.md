　　Men and Women Share Household Responsibilities Equally
  　Women in Hedong Actively Join the Ranks
    [Our dispatch] When the Hedong work group in the ninth district of Wu'an was connecting with poor peasants and hired laborers, they paid more attention to the work of poor peasant and hired women than at the beginning. When electing preparatory members of the poor peasant association, women accounted for seven of the nineteen candidates, and two were elected. Later, women held two of the seven members of the poor peasant association committee. Currently, women have developed to twenty-eight of the sixty-eight members of the poor peasant association, and they are now mobilizing middle peasant women to participate in the organization of the new farmers' association.
    Because Hedong Village is poor, working women account for the vast majority. Eight out of ten women have worked as short-term laborers for wealthy people in other villages (Shidong, Tian'erzhuang, Hexi, etc.) to cut wheat and harvest autumn crops. They can't forget those difficult times. With a little encouragement, their class hatred will be strongly expressed. However, in the past, women's work in the village was very insufficient. Usually, because they are busy with housework and production, they generally don’t care much about anything. When there are meetings, they say: "Go listen to the meeting." Some don’t even go to the meeting. So, the cadres generally think that "women don’t understand anything" and don’t pay much attention to them. For example, Lao Aizi, a member of the poor peasant association, did not want to come to the second meeting after attending a meeting of poor peasants for the first time (she is a good laborer in the whole village, with high prestige in the village. When men went to Guanwai for seven or eight years, she worked in the fields herself). She said: The rice at home will be finished in February, and she has to rely on spinning to buy rice, fearing that it would delay production: "I can't understand anything, I don't know the situation, and my heart and eyes are confused. Let those who can speak and work go!" After the female comrades of the work team patiently explained to her, she later said: "I figured it out. You are afraid to attend meetings, and I am afraid to attend meetings. Who will do things for us? Things always have to be done. If we turn ourselves over, production will be easier. If we delay production by holding a meeting today, we will produce more tomorrow." She also said: "Everyone wants to participate in the poor peasant association. Participating is lively, like a family. Everyone helps you, and you help me. Any opinions can be raised." One day she was sick, but as soon as she heard there was a meeting, she immediately got up and went.
    Grandma Fulai, who is sixty-seven years old, has suffered all her life, and has not yet completely turned herself over. She has never lit a lamp all year round. Because she is too old, no one pays attention to her. She never participates in village meetings, but this time she told the female comrades of the work team about the hardships of her life. She rose up in this movement, and her participation in meetings is more active than the young people. She attends every meeting and always arrives early, and she also spoke loudly when giving opinions to party members.
    Wang Tingze, an alternate member of the poor peasant association, usually dared not speak. This time, she was elected as an alternate member, and she was both happy and scared. She wanted to do things for the poor, but she was afraid that she couldn't do it, and cried several times in a hurry.
    The wife of Lao Yang, a hired laborer named Maibao, was nominated when the poor peasant association initiators were elected, but she was not elected, and she cried and went home, afraid of losing face.
    Mianting said: "In the past, I looked for a dark place to sit when I had meetings, but now I look for a bright place to sit."
    The above are all some of the most taciturn and inactive women who were considered backward. This time, they all poured into the movement. They all understand that "poor people are a family," their class consciousness has been raised, and their political demands have also been raised. In the past, they were afraid of meetings, but now they are afraid of being late for meetings, and they can only finish a meeting after it is late at night.
    When mass representatives gave opinions to each party member of the branch, the women representatives felt that their responsibilities were great, and they went to the masses to collect opinions during the day. Some individual women had been punished by village cadres in the past, and this time they wanted to take the opportunity to retaliate, but the women representatives held a meeting themselves after returning and discussed what kind of opinions should be raised and what kind of opinions should not be raised: "We are representatives, representing everyone to raise opinions. Don't just raise your own, lest people say we are retaliating. We can raise everyone's opinions, but don't forget them!"
    In short, in this movement, the poor and hired laboring women, who were usually considered "backward," showed unprecedented enthusiasm. They gradually understand the status of women in the future. They said: "Women are the same as men. If you study and study, your eyes will be bright. Everyone wants to be in charge of the family, and everyone wants to know more about things, and no one wants to lag behind." When there are meetings, the men also need to ask, "See if the women have any other opinions."

### 男女平等共同当家　河东妇女踊跃站队

　　男女平等共同当家
  　河东妇女踊跃站队
    【本报消息】武安九区河东工作组在串连贫雇时，已较开始时注意到贫雇妇女工作，选举贫农团筹备人时，十九个候选人中，妇女占七人，当选二人，以后七个贫农团委员中，有两个妇女，目前贫农团员六十八人中，妇女已发展到二十八人，现正由她们去发动中农妇女，参加组织新农会。
    由于河东村穷，劳动妇女占绝大多数，十个妇女中有八个都曾经在外村（石洞、田二庄、河西等）给老财们打过短工（割麦子、收秋等），她们都忘不了那苦难的时光，只要稍加启发，她们的阶级仇恨，会很强烈地表露出来。可是过去村中的妇女工作非常不够，平时又因为家务忙，生产忙，她们一般对于什么事也不大过问，开会时她们叫：“听会去”，有的连听会也不去的。于是一般干部也认为“娘们不懂什么”，不大重视她们。象贫农团委员老艾子，当初，她参加了一次贫农们开会后，第二次就不愿来了（她是全村的好劳动，在村中威信很高，男人去关外七、八年，自己下地顶个汉），她说：家里米吃到二月就完了，要靠纺花买米，怕耽误生产：“咱啥也听不懂，不摸情况，心肝眼又糊涂，叫人家能说会干的去吧！”经过工作组女同志耐心给她解释，后来她说：“想通了，你也怕参加会，我也怕参加会，谁给咱办事？事总得有人办，翻好了身，生产也就容易了，今天开会耽误生产，明天咱多生产些。”又说：“贫农团谁都愿参加，参加了红火，都象一家人，大家你帮我，我帮你，有啥意见也都提出了。”有一天她病了，但一听说开会，马上起来去了。
    六十七岁的福来奶奶，受了一辈子苦，今天还未翻透身，终年没点过灯，因为年纪太大，没人理睬她，村里开会时从不参加，但在这次却把她一生的苦处和工作组女同志谈出，她是在这次运动中起来了，参加会比年轻人都积极，每会必到，每到必早，给党员提意见时，她也大声的发了言。
    贫农团的候补委员王亭则，平时不敢说话，这次当选为候补委员，又高兴，又害怕，想给穷人办事，又怕办不了，急的哭了几场。
    老羊工麦保的老婆，在选举贫农团发起人时，别人提出了她，却又未选上，自己哭着回去了，怕丢人。
    棉廷说：“过去开会找个暗处坐，现在开会找个明处坐。”
    以上都是一些最不爱说话不爱活动被认为落后的妇女，这次都涌入运动中来，她们都了解到了“穷人是一家”，阶级觉悟提高了，政治要求也提高了，过去是害怕开会，现在是怕到会迟，而且在深夜散会后，一大会才能走完。
    当群众代表给支部每个党员提意见时，妇女代表们都感到自己责任重大，白天到群众中去搜集意见。有个别妇女过去被村干部处罚过，这次想趁机报复一下，但妇女代表回来后，又自己开了个会，讨论了一下什么样的意见该提，什么样的意见不该提：“咱是代表，代表大家提意见，不要光提自己的，省得人家说咱报复。咱可把大家的意见提到了，可别给忘了！”
    总之，在这次运动中，平时被认为“落后”的贫雇劳动妇女，表现了空前的积极，她们逐渐了解到今后妇女的地位，她们说：“妇女男人一样样，学习学习眼睛就明亮了，当家都愿当家，谁也愿意多知道点事，谁也不愿落后。”开会时汉们也须要问一问“看妇女们还有啥意见没有。”
