　　【Li Cheng News】The work team arrived in Nanweiquan on February 30th. From the beginning, they bypassed the old cadres and went deep into individual visits. They found truly honest poor and hired peasants, from a few colluding to dozens, from individual mobilization to organizing into poor peasant groups for collective mobilization. This was done for seven or eight days, focusing only on going deep into the poor and hired peasants, and neglecting to understand the thoughts of the middle peasants. Every day, they saw a group of people sitting and talking about something where they warmed themselves on the street. When the work team comrades passed by, they didn't talk. After they left, they started talking again. Discovering this situation, they consciously went to understand the thoughts of the middle peasants and found the following: (1) They didn't understand the Land Law and were afraid of being disrupted and divided equally. (2) They were afraid of having their good land divided. For example, Zhang Jinde was a newly prosperous middle peasant with a family of four and eighteen acres of land, which was relatively good, but his labor was also very good. After hearing that the work team had arrived, he sat on the street with some people every day without moving. When the work team chatted with him casually about the Land Law, he spoke his heartfelt words. Jinde said: "I heard in the meeting reading the newspaper that it was going to be divided equally, and the poor peasants wanted me to give out land. I would be happy to do that, as long as they don't struggle against me or control me. These few days, several cadres have come, and I thought they would organize the poor peasants to struggle. If they struggle, whatever they ask me to take out, I will take it out." He also said: "After this division, if someone wants to eat and drink lavishly and waste it, will they still get another share?" Wang Youde was afraid of being struggled against and didn't even carry manure, lending his donkey to others to carry manure. Huo Zui, an old middle peasant, didn't carry manure to the field but put it on the road, and even the poor and hired peasant Wang Jinde didn't carry manure. Because of these thoughts, the poor peasants formed a meeting, and the middle peasants also discussed things together, which caused the preparatory work for spring plowing to fall into a state of depression. The work team immediately convened a conference of middle and poor peasants, publicized the Land Law and the Administrative Office's announcement to ensure production and not abandon land. It was also said that since we came here, we have been visiting poor and hired peasants to see if they have turned themselves over. We have not taken care of holding a meeting and meeting with all the villagers, not because we are holding meetings with poor peasants to struggle against middle peasants and divide the land equally, nor is it a complete disruption and equal division. If it is moved, it will be a voluntary removal after consultation. The middle peasant Guo Chouhan said: "This way, we should be clear in our hearts. Those few days, I was muddled like being in an eggshell." Everyone's enthusiasm was very high. The next day, some cut firewood, some delivered manure, and some engaged in sideline businesses, and everyone started moving.

　　只顾访问贫雇引起中农怀疑
  　南委泉工作组纠正偏向
    【黎城消息】工作组二月三十号到南委泉，一开始就撇开旧干部，分头个别深入访问，找到了真正老实贫雇，由几个串通到数十个，由个别发动到组织成贫农小组集体发动，这样作了七八天，每日只顾深入贫雇，忽视了了解中农思想，每天看到街上取暖的地方坐着一群人在谈论什么，工作组同志过去就不谈了，走了又谈开了，发现这种情况，就有意识的去了解中农思想，发现有下面几种：（一）不了解土地法，害怕打乱平分，（二）怕把自己的好地分了。如张金德是个新富裕中农，有四口人，种十八亩地，地也较好，但他的劳动也很好，听说工作队来后，他每天和一些人坐在街上不动弹，和他闲拉土地法，他就谈出真心话，金德说：“我听开会念报要平分，贫农要叫我往出弄地，我也痛快，只要不斗争不管制我，我就高兴。这几天来了好几个干部，我心想组织好贫农就斗呀，斗动叫咱拿啥咱就拿啥。”又说：“分了这回以后，再有人要大吃二喝浪费了，是不是还再给他分一份。”王有德怕斗也不搬粪，把驴借给别人搬粪，霍嘴是一个旧中农，搬粪不往地搬，送在路上，甚至贫雇王金德也不搬粪。由于这些思想，形成了贫农在一块开会，中农也在一块议论，这样使春耕生产准备工作陷于消沉状态。工作组当即召开中贫农大会，宣传土地法和行署保障生产不荒土地的布告。又说这次我们一来就去访问贫雇看他们翻透身了没有，没有顾上开大会和全村群众见面，并不是和贫农开会要斗争中农，平分土地，也不是完全打乱平分，就是动的话，也是商商议议的自愿拿出。中农郭丑汉说：“这样咱心里该不是就清楚了，那几天迷闷闷的象在鸡蛋壳里。”大家情绪很高，第二天割柴的割柴，送粪的送粪，还有的搞副业，都动起来了。
