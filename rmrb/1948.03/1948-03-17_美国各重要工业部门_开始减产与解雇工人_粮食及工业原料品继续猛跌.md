Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 15th: TASS, New York, March 13th: According to newspaper reports, due to "overproduction," major U.S. industrial sectors have begun to reduce production and lay off workers. The production cuts are so widespread as to indicate that the economic crisis is drawing ever closer. The New York Times, reporting on the sharp decline in orders in basic industries, said in a panic: "The alarm bells have already sounded." The newspaper revealed that at a meeting of major manufacturers last week, manufacturer representatives said that due to the reduction in demand for industrial products, many new projects, new orders, and transactions in heavy industry are decreasing. The Wall Street Journal said that most machine manufacturing companies are failing to fully utilize their productive capacity. The largest Goodyear Tire Company has reduced production at its two Ohio plants by 30%. The largest Philco Radio Company has laid off 600 workers due to "overproduction." Other newspapers reported that the Jack & Heintz industrial equipment manufacturing company has laid off 1,500 workers, equivalent to a 38% reduction in the company's workforce. The Union Pacific Railroad Company is also laying off workers due to a decline in business. Ten thousand garment workers in New York have been either fully or partially unemployed due to production cuts. At the same time, the wholesale price index for 35 commodities continued to fall, dropping to the lowest point since July of last year—185.1.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 12th: New York dispatch: According to the Associated Press's price statistics for 35 commodities on the 10th, the prices of U.S. grain and industrial raw materials continued to plummet, breaking the lowest point of the sharp decline in February and falling back to the lowest point in early August of last year. The agency's price index for 35 commodities fell to 185.58 on the 10th, while the lowest point during last month's sharp decline was 186, a week earlier it was 188.56, in August of last year it was 185.37, and the post-war peak was 208.1 on January 9th. The agency also stated that New York stock prices fluctuated on the 10th.
