Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th: The People's Liberation Army's strict mass discipline during the Yichuan Campaign has spread throughout the Huanglong Sub-district. One unit, the 6th Detachment of a certain regiment, arrived at Yingwang Town in Yichuan at midnight on a certain day. They dared not wake the sleeping people, so they spent the cold night under the eaves of the houses along the street. The next morning, the masses invited the People's Liberation Army to rest in their homes. Before entering the houses, the soldiers first swept the streets and courtyards. The masses were extremely moved and discussed: "The Eighth Route Army is truly disciplined. Last night, no one knocked on doors or shouted. If it were the 'Central' Army (referring to the Chiang bandits), they would have broken down the doors and taken everything." When the unit captured Keya Town, it protected industry, commerce, and small vendors. The masses considered them as family, blockaded information for our army, and lured the enemy deep, causing the enemy to suffer a devastating blow. As soon as the battle ended, the shops began to open for business. The masses spread the word: "The People's Liberation Army has three good qualities: First, they are kind and don't scold or beat people. Second, they don't take even a needle or a thread. Third, they let the villagers sleep on the kang (heated brick bed) while they sleep on the ground, and they even clean up when they leave." They also said, "The People's Liberation Army borrows and returns things, buys and sells fairly, and is easy to talk to." After the liberation of Yichuan City, the People's Liberation Army immediately sent people to protect the schools. On the door of Yichuan Middle School, it was written: "This is a school, no camping allowed." The teachers were extremely moved. Shops and stalls in the city have all opened for business, and merchants and civilians have great confidence in the peasant currency. Rongqing Wucai Stone Printing Bureau on Zhengbei Street has already completed its first business since liberation, printing a large number of announcements for the Huanglong Special Office. The streets and post offices are crowded with people reading the announcements and the Masses Daily. Except for work or buying things, few idlers from the People's Liberation Army are seen on the streets.

　　黄龙分区老百姓称赞我军真规矩
    【新华社西北二十八日电】宜川战役中解放军严明的群众纪律现已传遍黄龙分区。某部六支队于某日午夜到达宜川之英王镇时，不敢惊醒酣睡中的人民，便在沿街屋檐下度过寒冷的夜晚。天亮后群众请解放军进屋休息，战士们未进房前就先打扫街道、院子，群众极为感动，纷纷议论说：八路军真规矩，昨晚没有一个敲门吼叫的，要是“中央”军（指蒋匪）早把门敲破，东西拿光了。该部于攻占可亚镇时，保护工商业及小贩等，群众认为是一家人，为我军封锁消息，诱敌深入，使敌军受到歼灭性的打击。战斗刚一结束，商店便开始营业，群众盛传着：“解放军有三好：一、不打不骂态度好。二、不拿一针一线好。三、让老乡睡炕，他们睡地下，走时还打扫”。又说：“解放军借东西有借有还，买东西公买公卖，有事情好商量”。宜川城解放后，解放军立即派人保护学校，在宜川中学门上写着：“此系学校不得驻扎”。教员们极为感动。市内商店摊贩都已营业，商民对农币信用极高。正北街荣庆五彩石印局已经完成解放后的第一笔生意，经黄龙专署印了大批布告。街头及邮局前挤满群众阅读布告和群众日报。解放军除了工作或购买东西外，很少闲杂人员在街上来往。
