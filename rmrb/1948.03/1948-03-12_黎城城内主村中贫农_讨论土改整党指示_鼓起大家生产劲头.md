(Taihang News) The poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhucun Village, Licheng County, enthusiastically discussed the instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the Central Bureau regarding land reform, party rectification, and the democratic movement in old and semi-old areas, further boosting everyone's production enthusiasm. After receiving the Xinhua Daily on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, the village read it to the masses word by word in the evening at the people's school. Whenever they read something that corresponded to the specific situation of the village, everyone would whisper, "Chairman Mao understands everything. Look how thoughtfully he takes care of each of us." Especially when they read about class division and component determination, everyone said, "I said there must be a standard! Good, this is it." Regarding the Party being open to the masses and inviting the masses to participate in Party meetings to review Party members, they expressed great concern: "We can really communicate with Chairman Mao's Party now." After reading it, they conducted group discussions. Some middle peasants said, "It was really boring for the poor and hired peasants to have meetings, and we just felt like we were being left out. After hearing this, we have a better understanding. We lower-middle peasants are one family. We were thinking blindly before!" Another middle peasant, Han Sheng, said, "The fertilizer has to be moved, the land has to be harrowed, and the seeds have to be sown. No matter when we get extra help, who can lose out in our family!" The poor peasant Zhu Fuliu said, "My manure has been moved, and I'll use the double harrow as soon as the land thaws." Finally, they inspected the spring plowing preparations by street, unanimously agreeing that those who have finished delivering manure should do other work and not be idle, and those who have not finished should hurry up and catch up, and we must do a good job in this year's production.

　　黎城城内主村中贫农
  　讨论土改整党指示　鼓起大家生产劲头
    【太行消息】黎城城内主村，中贫农热烈讨论中共中央及中央局关于老区及半老区土改整党与民主运动的指示，更加鼓起了大家的生产劲头。该村于本月三日下午接到新华日报后，晚上便在民校内逐字逐句的念给群众们听。每当念到相合于本村具体情况时，大家就都小声议论着：“毛主席是甚都了解，你看对咱每个人照顾的多周到。”特别是念到划阶级订成份，大家都说：“我说也总不能没有个标准呀！好，这就行啦。”对于党要在群众中公开，邀请群众参加党的会议审查党员，都十分关切的表示着：“咱可能和毛主席的党真正通气了”。念完后又分组进行了讨论，有些中农说：“贫雇开会咱实在闷的不行，只当是把咱摔开不管了，听了这可摸住个底了，咱中贫农就是一家，以前咱可是瞎想啦！”另一个中农韩升又说：“肥要搬，地要耙，种要下了，不管啥时抽补，咱一家人谁还能亏了谁哩！”贫雇祝富六说：“我的粪已搬完了，地消了就要上双耙。”最后又按街检查了春耕准备工作，一致意见，送完粪的要做其他活不能闲着，没送完的要赶快赶上，一定要把今年生产闹好。
