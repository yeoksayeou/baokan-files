Taihang Military Region Political Department Issues Order to the Entire Army:
  Sincerely Accept Supervision from the Masses

　　[Our dispatch] In order to thoroughly complete the tasks of Party rectification and army consolidation, the Political Department of the Taihang Military Region issued a "Political Order" to its subordinate units on the 5th of this month, requiring them to resolutely welcome and sincerely accept the masses' help in Party rectification and army consolidation. The order stated: Consolidating the ranks is a decisive key to winning a complete victory in the war and land reform. Our army is the people's army, and all thoughts and behaviors that violate the interests of the people must be resolutely struggled against without reconciliation. Currently, in the democratic make-up movement, the masses are actively concerned about their own troops, sincerely exposing and correcting violations of discipline within our army, and directly appealing to the Party newspaper to educate us, asking us to examine and correct ourselves. This is an extremely valuable expression from the masses, and we should warmly welcome and sincerely accept the education, criticism, and supervision of the people, and hope that they will continue to make suggestions. However, some troops are apathetic, indifferent, failing to examine or respond, showing indifference and disregard for the enthusiasm of the masses, and refusing the masses' help in Party rectification and army consolidation. This is an impermissible and extremely bad manifestation. Therefore, the order specifically instructs all units in the military region to immediately pay attention to the opinions of the masses, conduct serious and earnest examinations, respond publicly, and actively solicit criticism and supervision from the masses to educate their own troops. If there are still those who are indifferent, fail to examine, fail to correct, and adopt an attitude of ignoring, the Party committees and cadres at all levels should be held accountable and even subject to disciplinary action.

　　太行军区政治部训令全军
  　诚恳接受群众监督
    【本报消息】为彻底完成整党整军任务，太行军区政治部在本月五日，特向所属部队发布“政治训令”，要坚决欢迎和诚恳接受群众帮助整党整军。该训令说：整顿队伍是争取战争与土改彻底胜利的决定关键，我们的军队是人民的军队，一切违反人民利益的思想行为，都要不调和的坚决进行斗争。目前群众在民主填补运动中，积极关心自己的部队，诚恳的揭发纠正我们军队内部的犯纪行为，直接向党报申诉，教育我们，要我们检查纠正。这是群众极其宝贵的表示，我们应热烈欢迎与诚恳接受人民的教育批评与监督，并望继续不断提出。但有些部队对此反麻木不仁、满不在乎，不检查、不回答，表示对群众热情的冷淡、漠视态度，拒绝群众帮助我们整党整军，这是不可允许的极其恶劣的表现。为此，特训令全军区部队，要立即重视群众的意见，严肃认真的检查，公开回答，并主动征求群众的批评、监督，教育自己的部队。倘仍有漠不关心、不检查、不纠正、抱不理态度者，各级部队党委与干部应受到追究责任，直至纪律处分。
