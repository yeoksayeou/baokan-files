Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th: A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army liberated Heyang County on the night of the 25th at 12 o'clock. On the morning of the 27th at 7 o'clock, they took advantage of their victory to liberate Chengcheng County. Both cities are located northeast of Xi'an. Chengcheng is only 100 kilometers away from Xi'an. In the battle of Heyang, 130+ captured bandits from the Kuomintang 167th Brigade, 501st Regiment, 3rd Battalion, were taken prisoner. The spoils of war included one mortar, eight light and heavy machine guns, more than one hundred rifles and carbines, some ammunition, and two thousand shi of grain. The defending enemy of Chengcheng, the 3rd Battalion of the 499th Regiment of the 167th Brigade of the Kuomintang bandits, and the entire Chengcheng County Government Security Police Brigade were annihilated. The results of the battle are still being verified. The above two cities are the ninth and tenth county seats liberated since our army's southern offensive. So far, all eight county seats in our newly established Huanglong District—Hancheng, Heyang, Chengcheng, Yijun,中部 (Zhongbu), Luochuan, Yichuan, and Huanglong—have been liberated, except for Luochuan, where the enemy is still trapped in an isolated city. At the same time, another unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army launched a sabotage war against the Kuomintang bandits' Longhai Railway Xian (Yang) Tong (Guan) branch line, starting on the night of the 24th. By the afternoon of the 25th, they had occupied Huangbao Town, an important station on the Tong (Guan) Yao (Xian) section, and defeated the invading Kuomintang bandits. The sabotage war is now continuing to expand. Furthermore, when our army liberated Hancheng, the entire security police team of the puppet county government and the reactionary armed forces of four townships were annihilated, capturing 200 men and guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th: Since the liberation of Heyang and Chengcheng, the Huanglong District, except for the isolated city of Luochuan, has been completely liberated. The Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office of the district has issued a proclamation to the people of the entire district, announcing: (1) Abolish the Kuomintang bandit baojia system, establish people's democratic governments at the county, district, and township levels, organize people's organizations, and carry out various undertakings beneficial to the people. Former baojia personnel who can abide by the laws of the new government will not be held accountable for their past actions and will enjoy civil rights. (2) Confiscate the Kuomintang bandits' assets and warehouses in this district, carry out opening warehouses to relieve the poor, protect industry and commerce, implement free trade, and the banknotes of the Northwest Farmers Bank will be the legal currency and universally used. (3) Protect cultural and educational institutions such as schools, and welcome patriotic intellectuals, students, and teachers to participate in the cultural and educational work of the new government. (4) Welcome the security police and self-defense team personnel of the Kuomintang government to join the People's Liberation Army. Those who come with weapons will be rewarded by this office. (5) The public education personnel and Kuomintang members and Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps members of the Kuomintang-Hu government will be leniently dealt with. Ordinary party members and Youth League members who register with governments at all levels will be exempted from investigation. Those who have done evil but can repent and start anew will be allowed to atone for their crimes. Those who have never done evil and have contributed to the people's democratic cause will be used according to their abilities. Those who have committed heinous crimes, continue to do evil after the establishment of the new regime, and are intolerable to the people will be severely punished according to law. (6) Abolish exorbitant taxes and levies and all forms of exploitation by the Kuomintang regime, and implement fair and reasonable burdens. The office will formulate separate regulations and conduct democratic assessments by the people. At the same time, the requisition of military grain and grass will be carried out from the landlord class to meet the needs of the revolutionary war.
