Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 8th: Mr. Liu Shaobai, Vice-Chairman of the Jin-Sui Border Region Provisional Assembly, has been formally reinstated after the Farmers' Representative Assembly of the Second District of Xing County officially rescinded its original resolution, requesting him to continue in his post. Last September, farmers from Liu Shaobai's hometown of Hei Yukou Village in Xing County, believing that Mr. Liu Shaobai had shielded landlords during the land reform, engaged in reasoning and struggle with him and suggested that he be removed from his position as Vice-Chairman. Afterwards, Mr. Liu Shaobai went door-to-door to solicit opinions from the farmers and admitted his mistakes at a mass meeting, offering up surplus property and expressing his willingness to sever ties with the landlords. Local farmers believed that he could humbly listen to the people's opinions, and last month proposed to the Xing County Second District People's Representative Assembly that the original resolution be rescinded and his position be restored. Mr. Liu Shaobai also attended the assembly and, with a sincere and frank attitude, reiterated to the people his determination to cast off his feudal baggage and admit his past crimes of abetting his brother Liu Xiangkun (a heinous local tyrant) in oppressing the farmers. He reflected that in the past he had too little contact with the farmers, lacked understanding, and had done too little for the people in the past decade, for which he felt very ashamed. He now wished to resolutely support the Communist Party's policies, assist the farmers in eliminating feudalism, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Wu Xinyu, Director of the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office, simultaneously declared to the assembly representatives: "The Administrative Office's political affairs meeting discussed the suggestions of the masses in Hei Yukou Village last year, believing that according to democratic principles, this was only the opinion of one village, and it had not been discussed by the People's Representative Assembly of the entire border region, so the Administrative Office had not made any decisions based on this. At the same time, more importantly, Mr. Liu Shaobai is an enlightened gentleman who supported the Communist Party's policies during the War of Resistance, and today supports land reform. The Communist Party cooperates with enlightened gentlemen, and today it still advocates and supports cooperation with enlightened patriotic elements who advocate the Communist Party's policies. The government also suggests retaining Mr. Liu in his original post." The farmer representatives spoke up one after another, endorsing the proposal, which was unanimously approved by the assembly.

　　晋绥临参会副议长
  　刘少白先生复职
    【新华社晋绥八日电】晋绥边区临时参议会副议长刘少白先生，刻经与县二区农民代表大会正式通过收回原议，请其继续留职工作。按去年九月刘少白先生之故乡兴县黑峪口村农民以刘少白先生在土地改革中包庇地主，曾向其进行说理斗争，并建议撤消其副议长职务。事后，刘少白先生曾挨户向农民征求意见，并在群众大会上承认错误，献出多余财物，愿意斩断与地主联系。当地农民认为他能虚心倾听人民意见，特于上月向兴县二区人民代表大会提议收回原议，恢复其职务。刘少白先生亦莅大会，并以诚恳坦白态度再度向人民表示坚决放下封建包袱，承认过去助长了他兄弟刘象坤（罪大恶极之恶霸）欺压农民的罪行。他反省过去对农民接触太少，了解不够，十余年来为人民办事太少，十分惭愧，今后愿坚决拥护共产党政策，赞助农民消灭封建，全心全意为人民服务。晋绥边区行政公署主任武新宇，同时向大会代表宣称：“行署政务会议去年对黑峪口群众的建议曾进行讨论，认为按民主原则，这只是一个村子的意见，而未经全边区人民代表会议讨论，故行署未根据此作出任何决定。同时更重要的，刘少白先生是开明绅士，抗战期间赞成共产党的政策，今天已拥护土地改革。共产党与开明绅士合作，今天还是主张和赞成共产党政策的开明绅士爱国分子合作，政府亦建议留刘先生原职工作”。农民代表纷起发言，拥护此提议，全场一致通过。
