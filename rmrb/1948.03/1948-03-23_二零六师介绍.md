　　In the autumn of 1944, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits suffered a major defeat in the Central Plains, retreating thousands of miles in Hunan and Guangxi. They coerced 100,000 educated youths into joining the army, forming nine divisions, but most of the young student soldiers deserted after witnessing the darkness and corruption of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army. After Japan surrendered, in order to drive the youth to the civil war battlefield and sell their lives for the interests of the four major families, Chiang Kai-shek established a reserve officer system, reorganizing the youth army into three armies. The 206th Division, which was annihilated in Luoyang this time, was established in Hanzhong on New Year's Day in 1945. The majority of its members were young intellectuals and junior civil servants from Gansu, Ningxia, Anhui, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Qinghai, Shandong, and the Northwest Highway Bureau, the Longhai Railway Bureau, and National No. 22 Middle School. The first commander of the division was Fang Xianjue, a traitorous general who surrendered in Hengyang, and the current commander is Qiu Xingxiang. After Japan surrendered, the division was assigned to the Ninth Army, comprising two brigades and six regiments. One of the regiments was annihilated in Yuncheng, Shanxi last year, and the Fourth Regiment was annihilated in Shan County in September last year (and later rebuilt). The commander of the Second Brigade, Jiang Gongmin, was also captured at the same time. The current Fifth and Sixth Regiments are young people who were coerced into the army in the second phase, only a few months ago. The units annihilated in Luoyang this time were the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Regiments, as well as one division headquarters and two brigade headquarters. The Fifth Regiment went to Hankou and Xi'an two months ago to receive new recruits, and the deputy division commander, Zou Zhenshen, is still undergoing training and has not returned.

      二零六师介绍
    一九四四年秋，蒋匪中原大败，在湘桂一退千里后，乃胁骗十万知识青年从军，编成九个师，但青年学兵目睹蒋匪军队黑暗腐败，大多逃跑。日本投降后蒋匪为驱逐青年走向内战战场，代四大家族利益卖命，即以建立预备军官制度为名，将青年军编成三个军。此次洛阳被歼之二○六师，系一九四五年元旦在汉中成立，其中大部为甘、宁、皖、晋、豫、冀、青、鲁等省及西北公路局、陇海铁路局及国立二十二中学的青年知识分子和小公务员。该师第一任师长为衡阳降将汉奸方先觉，现任师长为邱行湘。日本投降后该师编属第九军，共辖两旅六团，其中一个团于去年在山西运城被歼，第四团于去年九月在陕县被歼（后又重建），第二旅旅长蒋公敏同时被俘。现在的五、六两团均系第二期被胁入伍不过几个月的青年。此次在洛阳被歼的为一、二、三、四、六团及一个师部，两个旅部。第五团二月前去汉口、西安接收新兵，副师长邹珍善则受训未回。
