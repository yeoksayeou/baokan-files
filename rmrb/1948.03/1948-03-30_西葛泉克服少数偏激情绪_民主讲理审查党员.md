[Shahe News] After the work team arrived in Xigequan Village and spent two days understanding the situation, most of the poor and hired peasants in the village had been emancipated. Based on this, they determined the specific direction of the work. On the third day, they convened a mass meeting, expressed their attitude, and publicized various policies, which allowed the masses to get their bearings and dare to approach them. After networking, they organized poor and hired peasant groups, who became the locomotive of the work. When they united and mobilized more than 100 people, they established a preparatory committee for the farmers' association to prepare for the establishment of a new farmers' association. In order to initially clarify the class composition of the entire village, they conducted a classification of components.

In terms of Party rectification: most of the eight Party members were poor peasants, generally over-profiting after emancipation, half of them had poor work styles, one was severely corrupt, and one harbored a landlord. The first branch meeting was ineffective in introspection. It was not until the third day that several Party members, such as Hao Ergui, who had minor errors, began to show some awareness and engaged in ideological struggle. Another type of person resisted (with varying degrees of errors). Hao Youkui said, "Being a Communist Party member means having to reflect and examine yourself every few days. It's really better to be a mass member and have peace of mind." Some complained to the masses and leaders. After five or six days of reflection, there was slight progress. The masses elected seven or eight representatives to participate in the branch meeting to help Party members reflect. The better Party members realized that the power of the masses was great. Party member Hao Ergui said, "The masses are really good. Their understanding of the issues is sharper than ours." Party members with major errors had concerns, fearing struggle and beatings, showing panic and depression. The leadership promptly conducted individual talks, providing further analysis to comrades with minor problems and educating them to engage in a firm ideological struggle against other bad Party members, playing a core role in the intra-Party struggle. For comrades with major errors, the leading cadres adopted a warm, healing, and salvaging attitude, not to strike or harbor them. They also conducted individual talks.

At the request of the masses, all Party members were announced publicly at the general assembly to allow for mass opinion to ferment. Two situations were found among the masses. Some with grievances and a few young people advocated fighting, while the majority of honest peasants advocated being reasonable and not fighting. The work team guided the discussions in groups, and the discussions in each group were very heated. As a result, three out of four groups advocated being reasonable. One group still had people advocating fighting. After discussion at the general assembly, it was finally unanimously advocated to be reasonable, and the biased sentiments of a few people were overcome. On the 21st, Party members met with the masses publicly. A large number of people attended, including people from five neighboring villages, totaling more than 400 people. At the meeting, the leadership reiterated its attitude, pointing out that today's meeting was to fully promote democracy and that this was not like washing one's face and making it look black, like before. Hao Youjin and Xi Diansheng, representatives of the new farmers' association, also spoke, saying, "Today, we want democracy. This is a meeting for reason, not for fighting or arguing..." Party member Zhao Tuhe (Director of the Armed Forces Committee) was the first to report and examine himself, making a more detailed reflection on issues such as over-profiting, commandist work style, and indiscriminate labeling of people as secret agents. The masses had the most opinions about Deputy Village Chief Hu Tai. Old Lady He said, "My eldest son, Xicheng, was afraid of causing trouble and didn't let me mention it, but he couldn't stop my mouth. Our Eighth Route Army speaks the truth. You, Hu Tai, are even more fierce than before. Without saying a word, you often say that my son has problems for not attending meetings. Before, we were oppressed, and now we are being wronged by you... I feel so happy to speak the truth today." The speeches at the meeting continued. Finally, four Party members, including Hao Ergui, reflected well and were absorbed into the new farmers' association. The remaining four continued to reflect deeply. After the meeting, middle peasant Fang Xiuqi reflected, "I was originally planning to go to Yongnian to see my nephew. Fortunately, I didn't go. This meeting was really good."

　　西葛泉克服少数偏激情绪
  　民主讲理审查党员
    【沙河消息】工作组到达西葛泉村后，经两天了解情况，全村贫雇大部翻了身，据此确定了工作的具体方针。第三天便召开了群众大会，表明了我们的态度，进行宣传各种政策，这样使群众摸着了头脑，敢接近我们。经过串连组织了贫雇小组，他们成了工作中的火车头，由他们再去团结中农，串连发动到一百多人的时候，成立了农会筹委会，筹备成立新农会，为了初步的搞清全村阶级面貌，进行了一次划成份。
    在整党方面：八个党员，大部是贫农，一般是翻身高多占果实，二分之一作风恶劣，有一个腐化严重，一个包庇地主。第一次支部会，反省没效，直到第三天，党员中郝二贵等几个错误不严重的开始有点觉悟，进行开思想斗争。另一种人是抵抗（错大错小的都有），郝有魁说：“当共产党员，隔几天总得反省检讨的，真不如当个群众清静。”有些向群众与领导发牢骚，进行了五、六天反省稍有进展，群众们选出七、八个代表，参加支部会，帮助党员反省。较好的党员体会到群众力量大，党员郝二贵说：“群众就是行呀，认识问题比咱还尖锐。”错大的党员有顾虑，怕斗、怕打，表现恐慌，情绪消沉。随着领导上及时分头进行了个别谈话，对问题小的同志，是帮助他进一步分析，并教育向其他坏党员作坚决思想斗争，起党内斗争的核心作用，对错大的同志，领导干部是抱着一种热情相待、治病救人、改造挽救的态度，决不是打击的，更不是包庇的，也同样做了个别谈话。
    在群众要求下，将全数党员在大会宣布公开，叫群众舆论酝酿。在群众中便发现两种情况，一些有苦水及少数年青人主张要打，绝大部分老实农民主张不打要讲理，工作组引导分组进行酝酿，各小组内争论很热烈，结果四个组有三个组主张讲理。有一个组仍有人主张打，后经大会讨论，最后一致主张讲理，对少数人偏激情绪也克服了。廿一号，党员向群众公开见面，到会人数很多，邻近的五个村子也有来参加的，足有四百余人。开会时，领导上再次表明态度，指出今天充分发扬民主，这次绝不是象以前洗脸擦黑一样，新农会代表郝有金、席殿生也讲了话，他们说：“今天要民主，是讲理大会，不是打架、吵嘴的………。”党员赵土和（武委会主任）首先自报名检讨，把多占果实命令作风、乱戴特务帽子等………作了较详细的反省。群众对副村长胡太提的意见最多。老和家娘说：“俺老大（大儿）喜成怕惹事不叫提，他也没缝住我的嘴。咱八路军是说真理的，你胡太比过去还厉害，二话不说，你常说俺小子开会不到有问题，以前受压迫，现在又受你的屈………今日说了真痛快。”会场的发言连续不断。最后郝二贵等四个党员反省好，吸收参加新农会，其余四个仍继续作深刻反省。会后中农方秀棋反映说：“我本来说要去永年看我侄儿来，幸亏没去了，这个会开的真好。”
