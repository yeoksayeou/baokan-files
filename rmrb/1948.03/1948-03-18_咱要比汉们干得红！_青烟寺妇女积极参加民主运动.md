We Must Do Better Than the Men!
　　Women of Qingyan Temple Actively Participate in the Democratic Movement

　　When the Qingyan Temple work team began visiting poor and hired peasants, they believed that women were relatively backward and had to wait until the men were mobilized before starting to mobilize the women, neglecting women's work. However, during unannounced visits to poor and hired peasant families, some of the women in these families had already been somewhat influenced by the conversations between the work team and the men. When the men (poor and hired peasants) spontaneously connected and discussed how to be masters of their own affairs and expressed many opinions about the oppression of the cadres, a group of middle peasant women, driven by the common desire to resist the oppression of the old women's director, spontaneously connected and invited the work team comrades to participate in their meeting, asking for their help and assistance in organizing them.

　　At the mass meeting to rectify the Party, the women also boldly raised opinions to the Party member cadres. Lianzi suffered a lot from the women's director, Guo Shulin. Her husband had been in the army for three years without any news, and Guo Shulin said: "You should find someone else, your man is probably dead." Lianzi cried when she was reminded of her most painful wound. Another woman, Huanzi, raised an opinion about personal revenge against Party member Wang Maomei due to a family dispute between sisters-in-law. On the spot, all the women criticized her, saying: "Don't bring up family matters, it's wasting everyone's time." The 65-year-old poor peasant woman, Lao Duizi, is still in debt and has not been able to stand up. She has suffered from the cadres' oppression and has been holding back a lot of grievances. When raising opinions at the meeting, Lao Duizi and her husband argued about who should speak, as she felt her husband couldn't express himself clearly. Before the class division, each household was only allowed to send one head of household, and she had argued with her husband about it, insisting on going herself. She said: "Let me go, you can't explain it clearly." Her husband naturally refused, so she tested him: "Can you tell me what our family was like in 1940, how did we get by?" This stumped her husband, who couldn't remember for a moment. After a brief argument, Lao Duizi reminded her husband of many things, but still insisted on going with him. In the struggle for democracy, women similarly expressed their demands, being bold and active.

　　The poor peasant woman, Yang Xingrong, only has three acres of poor land and relies on her own hands to support her family. Often, she is waiting for rice to cook. At first, when she described her past hardships, she said: "Ah! It's better now, we can eat whatever we have, I don't think about anything. If we could change houses, change our broken house, but if not, it's okay." She was very satisfied with her current life, and although the cadres were not democratic, she felt that this life was better than the past. After some encouragement, she gradually changed. At the meeting to elect initiators for the poor peasant group, some women suggested that Yang Xingrong was leaking information to the cadres (i.e., currying favor with the cadres) and disagreed with her being an initiator. But she did not become passive because of this, feeling that this was her own shortcoming and that she would definitely work actively in the future to dispel the masses' misunderstanding. She said: "I used to be afraid of harming others (referring to Guo Shulin), so I would go wherever they told me. I'm not afraid if you say I leak information, I'll change in the future. It doesn't matter if I'm not an initiator, we'll all help each other. I'll do whatever you want me to do." Her work performance was indeed more active afterward, and finally, the masses' eyes are sharp. At the founding meeting of the poor peasant league, she was elected as a member of the poor peasant league with 61 votes (the second highest number of votes overall).

　　When the poor peasant league absorbed members, they all went through a process of criticism and self-criticism. They said: "This is like giving people a medical check-up and treatment, so that we can all work together wholeheartedly to be masters of our own affairs." During mutual examination, because the women's social circles were small, most of the opinions among themselves were about family discord, disharmony with neighbors, gossiping, and other issues. When absorbing each person, they first examined themselves and identified their own problems. Shuanglin's daughter-in-law said: "I like to argue with my mother-in-law." Others pointed out: "If you can't get along with your mother-in-law, how can you unite with everyone? You must change in the future!" Criticism was raised against some young women who liked to go visiting and not stay at home: "You're wasting time not working, how can you live if you don't produce?" The people being criticized lowered their heads: "I won't do it again!" Xian'e and her husband were not getting along, and she did not engage in self-criticism at the meeting, so it was raised: "You're still having trouble with your man!" Through the criticism and education at the meeting, the discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and between husbands and wives, which had not been resolved by usual persuasion, was resolved, and everyone was willing to improve.

　　Once, a woman from a rich peasant background, Duan Sanzi, was being absorbed. She had been married to a poor peasant for seven years. She said: "I really want to join! I know my conditions are not good, I come from a rich peasant background, but I've been through it for seven years, lived a poor life for seven years, moved from house to house (begging for food and lodging), swallowed chaff and swallowed vegetables... See if everyone wants me or not?" Everyone asked: "Have you discarded your rich peasant roots?" Duan Sanzi replied: "I've long forgotten those rich roots, forgotten them. After suffering these years, I've also realized the sins of eating well and dressing well in the past." Ma Shan's mother, who was presiding over the meeting, continued: "That's right! You must remember the days in the poor household and walk with us poor peasants." She raised her voice and agreed: "The hard days have already taught me a lesson, I want to walk with the poor." Everyone agreed to let her join the farmers' association. Women have begun to move from opinions between you and me to opinions between everyone, and even more so to opinions on class positions.

　　Self-criticism and criticism were launched at the women's group meetings of the poor peasant league. They broke all pretenses and criticized the trivial matters among the women. Lao Bozi said: "Everyone give me some opinions and see if I have corrected them." Changting and Huanzi had gotten into a disagreement over gossiping, and Lao Wenting resolved the knot for them, saying: "A pepper that's as big as a bean won't kill anyone, it just stings for a moment, what's the big deal? Why tie the knot so tight?" Huanzi said: "It's not tight, our knot is loose, it'll open with a kick." Everyone also talked about not bringing up family matters as much in the future, saying: "People say that we women never run out of things to talk about. In the future, we'll put family matters aside and only talk about everyone's affairs. Otherwise, when we raise opinions at the general meeting, people will be holding small meetings behind our backs (saying people don't want to listen). Those family matters, they'll all be solved slowly after the Land Law Outline is passed!"

　　In another group, two women started arguing on the spot during criticism. Lao Heting gave Junzi an opinion about something that happened seven or eight years ago. As soon as she brought it up, she was opposed by everyone: "This is an old matter from several years ago, Junzi has already changed, you shouldn't bring up old things to criticize people." Originally, the two of them had been at odds for more than half a year over a small matter, and as soon as it was mentioned, they started arguing tit-for-tat. Everyone hurriedly stopped them, and Junzi left the meeting in tears. Lao Heting was criticized: "You're bringing up opinions with anger! You're not here to treat people's illnesses." "Lao Heting's temper hasn't changed, she's picking a fight at the meeting, this isn't for unity!" Xiangzi's mother said: "If we raise opinions like this, we'll all just exchange big knots instead of resolving grudges, how can we work together in the future!" Ma Shan's mother was so angry that she didn't want to hold the meeting anymore. She said: "This will make people laugh, how can we talk about being masters of our own affairs?" Lao Heting was criticized and felt ashamed, so she turned her back and admitted: "Yes, my attitude was not good." They were not called to the second group meeting. The opinion of all thirteen people in the group was that they were afraid that they would clash and quarrel if they came together, so they were temporarily left outside for a while and not called to join the poor peasant league group. The group leader said: "Let them reflect on their mistakes, and we'll only call them in when they have improved." Lin He said: "Let them all untie their knots before coming in." Lan Yingzi said: "It's not good to just leave them out in the cold, we shouldn't let them separate from us like that, we should help them reconcile and work well with us after they correct themselves." So they discussed sending Ma Shan's mother and Guai Xiting to talk to them, tell them the group's opinions, especially Lao Heting, and not just say that they would change and accept, but to look at their actions. As a result of the talk, Lao Heting expressed sadness and said: "I regretted it when I came back, I've been feeling uneasy these past two days, I should have resolved this knot from the past with her. Why did I remember the grudge, I must return to the poor peasant league, and I will definitely correct myself in the future." After such a dispute, the group proposed paying attention. Ma Shan's mother said: "If we don't unite, how can we unite the middle peasants? Everyone must not cause trouble in the future." In the subsequent absorption of people, they proposed the condition of "not causing trouble."

　　When planning the members of the farmers' association, several women were also planned. Maiting said: "We women are not capable, we're ignorant..." Changting immediately continued: "We must not say that women are not capable in the future, we must do better than the men!"

　　咱要比汉们干得红！
  　青烟寺妇女积极参加民主运动
    青烟寺工作组开始访问贫雇时，认为妇女比较落后，必须等男人们都动起来之后，再去着手发动妇女，忽略了妇女工作。可是在暗访贫雇中，某些贫雇农家的妇女，在工作组和男人们的交谈中，她们已经受了些影响。当男人们（贫雇）自动串连起来在一起商量如何当家，并对干部的压迫表示许多意见的时候，有一部分中贫农妇女，在反抗旧妇女主任压迫的共同要求下，自动串连起来了，她们来邀请工作组同志参加她们的会，要求给她们帮助并帮助组织她们。
    在整党的群众大会上，妇女们也大胆向党员干部提意见。莲子受妇女主任郭淑林的气不少。她的丈夫参军三年没有音讯，郭淑林说：“快跟××对了象吧，你男人早死了。”莲子提到最伤心处哭了。另一妇女环子为了家庭妯娌之间的纠纷向党员王茂梅提了私人报复的意见，当场全体妇女都批评她说：“不要提家情事了，耽误大家的时间。”六十五岁的贫农妇女老对子，到现在还是个窟窿户，没有翻了身又受干部的气，一肚子的委曲蹩到现在了，在大会提意见时，老对子和她丈夫争着要说，她嫌她丈夫说不清。在这以前划阶级时，每户只到一个家长，她就和丈夫吵过嘴，争着去。她说：“叫我去，你说不清。”丈夫自然不让，于是她考问了：“你说咱家二十九年是啥样，怎过来？”真是把丈夫问住了一时记不起，争吵了一阵，老对子向老汉提醒了很多，最后仍坚持同去。在争取民主中，妇女同样的表现了她们的要求，是大胆的积极的。
    贫农妇女杨杏荣，只有三亩坏地，依靠自己一双手养活了一家人，时常是等着米下锅。开始她叙述起她过去的苦日子来就说：“唉！这回可好过了，现在有啥吃就行了，啥也不想，要能换房，把咱这破房换换，不换也没啥。”她已非常满足于目前的生活，虽然干部不民主，但她也认为这生活比较过去已经不错了。经过启发，她渐渐有了转变。贫农小组选举发起人的大会上，有个别妇女提出杨杏荣给干部透气（即是巴结干部），而不同意她为发起人。但她并不因此而消极，觉得这是自己的缺点，今后一定积极工作来解除群众的误会，她说：“咱以前是害人家的怕（指郭淑林），所以叫咱到哪儿咱就到哪，说我透气，我不怕，以后改过，不让当发起人也不要紧，咱大家伙帮办，要我办啥我就办啥。”以后工作表现果然是更积极了，终于群众的眼是亮的，在贫农团成立大会上，以六十一票（全体第二票数），当选为贫农团委员。
    贫农团吸收团员时，都经过一番批评与自我批评，她们说：“这是给人瞧病治病，治好了叫咱都能一心才能当家办事。”互相审查时，由于妇女们生活圈子小，相互间的意见多为家庭不睦，处邻居不融洽，闲嘴多等问题。每吸收一个人的时候，先自己检讨出自己有啥毛病，双林媳妇子说：“我爱和咱婆婆顶个嘴”，别人就提出：“跟你婆婆闹不和气还能跟咱大伙团结哩？往后改了才行呀”！对于一些年青妇女好串门子不守家的提出批评：“把时间耽误了不作营生，不生产怎么好”？被批评的人低了头：“往后可不啦”！先娥和丈夫不合，自己并没有在会上自我批评，于是会上提出了：“你光和你掌柜闹格擦还照哩”？这样经过会上的批评教育，平时劝说没有生效的婆媳间和妯娌间夫妇间的不和都解了圪瘩，大家都愿改好。
    有一次吸收到一个老财底子的妇女段三子，她嫁给贫农已经七年了，她自己说：“我可是想进来呀！我就知道我条件不好，是老财底子，但咱走过来已七年了，过了七年穷苦日子，串房子也串来（讨吃借住），咽过糠咽过菜………看大家要我不要我”？众人提出：“你把你那老财根丢了没有？”段三子回答：“咱那富根子早丢了忘了，受了这几年的苦也想到了从前吃好穿好的罪过”。主持会场的马山娘接着说：“对啦！你可好好记着在贫户家的日子，跟咱贫农走一道”。她特别提高了声音答应着：“苦日子早把咱受过来了，咱就是要和穷人走在一起”。大家同意了她进农会。妇女们已开始由你我之间的意见，进至大伙间的又更进至阶级立场问题的意见了。
    贫农团妇女小组会上展开自我批评与批评。她们打破了一切情面，批评了妇女之间的鸡毛蒜皮的琐事，老卜子说：“大家都给我提提意见，看我改正了没有”，长亭和环子因为倒闲话挽了个圪塔，老文亭给她们解疙瘩说：“斗大个花椒也药不死个人，不过麻一会子，啥大不了的事，疙瘩挽得那个紧”？环子说：“不紧，咱这疙瘩松，一蹬就开了。”大家又谈到以后家情事少提，说：“人家都说咱妇女的事情就提不完，往后咱把家情事搁在后头，光提大家的事，要不，咱们在大会上提意见哩，人家在后面开小会哩（说人家不愿听），那些家情事，等咱土地法大纲过了后，慢慢总要解决哩！”
    另一小组在批评中两个妇女当场吵起来了，老合亭给俊子提意见翻了七八年前的事，刚提出来，就遭到大伙的反对：“这是好几年的旧事，俊子早改了，不应该找那老事情出来批评人”。本来她二人因小事早已闹了半年多不和气，一经提起就针锋相对的吵开了。众人急忙阻止，俊子哭着离了会场，老合亭被批评：“这是带气提意见哩！不是给人治病来了。”“老合亭脾气没改，在会上来挑嘴，这不是为团结嘛！”祥子娘说：“咱们要象这样提意见，都叫换上大疙瘩不是解仇气，往后还能搞在一起啦！”马山娘气愤得不愿开会了，她说：“这可叫人家有笑话了，还说啥当家办事？”老合亭被批评得面上不好看背调过去了，承认：“对，是我态度不好。”第二次小组开会时，没有叫她们，全组十三个人的意见，怕她们来了碰在一起吵闹，让她们暂时在外搁一搁，不叫进贫农团小组来。组长说：“叫她们好好回想回想自己的不对，改好了才叫进”。林合说：“叫她们都解了疙瘩再进来。”兰英子说：“光搁在外头凉着也不好，不叫她就那样和咱分岔了，咱们该帮助人家合好，改正了还和咱们好好一起干”。于是商量了推出马山娘和拐喜亭去和她们谈谈，告诉她们小组的意见，尤其是老合亭，不要光是嘴上说改说接受，而要看行动。谈的结果，老合亭表示出难过说：“回来我就后悔了，这两天心里格沙沙地，我应该和人家解了从前这疙瘩嘛。为啥倒记下了仇气，咱一定要回贫农团，往后一定我纠正。”经过了这样一次纠纷，小组中就提出注意，马山娘说：“咱们要不团结，怎去联合中农呢？以后大家可闹不得。”在以后的吸收人时，她们提出了：“不起挑拨”的条件。
    筹划农会委员的时候，也筹划了好几个妇女，麦亭说：“咱妇女不照，一头蒙……”长亭马上接着说：“咱往后可不要说妇女不照，咱要干的比汉们还红呢！”
