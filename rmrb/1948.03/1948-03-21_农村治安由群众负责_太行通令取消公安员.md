    Rural Public Security to be the Responsibility of the Masses
  　Taihang Order Cancels Public Security Officers
    [Taihang News] In order to unify village-level leadership and fully promote democracy, the Taihang District Public Security Bureau has issued an order to the entire district to abolish village-level public security directors and public security officers. The order states: Since the establishment of village-level public security organizations, public security directors, and public security officers in our district around 1943, they have indeed played a considerable role in carrying out mass anti-espionage work, investigating special agent activities, supervising bad elements, and establishing rural public security. However, due to insufficient leadership inspection and education, and the impurity of the composition of village public security directors (officers), the public security organizations in some villages have been controlled by unscrupulous elements, who, in the name of public security and eliminating traitors, arbitrarily oppressed the masses, engaged in favoritism and retaliation, and even committed heinous acts of harming good people, which not only hindered work but also restricted the implementation of democracy for the masses. After the democratic party rectification and land reform movement, the awareness of the broad masses of peasants will be greatly enhanced; in order to unify village-level leadership, fully promote democracy, and truly place all power in the hands of the masses, it has been decided that all village-level public security directors and public security officers in our district will be abolished. From now on, rural public security and other work will be under the leadership of the village peasant representative conferences.

    农村治安由群众负责
  　太行通令取消公安员
    【太行消息】为统一村级领导，充分发扬民主，太行区公安局特通令全区取消村级公安主任公安员，通令中说：我区至四三年前后，建立村级公安组织，公安主任、公安员以来，在开展群众反奸工作，侦察特务活动，监督坏人，建立农村治安等工作上，确实曾起了相当作用。但由于领导上检查教育不够，和村公安主任（员）成份的不纯，致使部分村庄公安组织，被不良分子所掌握，利用公安除奸之名，任意欺压群众，假公报私，甚至有为非作歹，陷害好人的恶劣现象，不仅妨害工作，而且限制了对群众民主的实施。经过民主整党和土改运动，广大农民群众的觉悟程度，将大大提高；为了统一村级领导，充分发扬民主，一切权力真正掌握在群众手里，决定我区村级公安主任、公安员一律取消。今后农村治安等工作，统由村农代会负责领导。
