　　Qilidian Abuses Fruits of Struggle to Run a Theater Troupe; Over 700,000 Wasted in a Year
　　Editor:
　　In Qilidian, the fourth district of Yongnian, the masses have not thoroughly turned over, and even the little they gained was given to the theater troupe. Last year, during the Lunar New Year, the village Farmers' Association director, Hou Anqiu, used the excuse of holiday entertainment to start a theater troupe. This troupe's food, drink, and equipment all came from the fruits of struggle and apportionments. The actors even cooked collectively and ate for over a month. Twelve mu of land seized through struggle was also given to the troupe. When it was first established, Hou Anqiu asked everyone to "support it," and the masses gave amounts ranging from 300, 200, to 1,000 yuan. Twenty-four poor peasant households were allocated a waterwheel, but they sold it to give money to the troupe. After the troupe spent all the money, they again apportioned 200 yuan per household. The third time, the masses divided up the fruits of struggle in silver dollars, with each household receiving 500 yuan worth of shares in the village cooperative. Under the strong urging of the Farmers' Association director, they all gave it to the troupe. The fourth time, the remaining 130,000 yuan from the fruits of struggle was deposited in the village cooperative, and he managed to get it for the troupe. He also secretly sold two large wine vats from the Farmers' Association's surplus fruits of struggle for 15,000 yuan; a large locust tree for 12,000 yuan; a waterwheel frame for 35,000 yuan; and a pair of cart axles for 20,000 yuan. The poor peasant Hou Niuzi, who fled famine from Shanxi and returned, could not get anything, so he sold a house seized through struggle for 20,000 yuan and gave it to the troupe. The poor peasant Wen Degui's child went to the troupe to learn opera, stayed for ten days or so, but the troupe said he was stupid and illiterate and told him to leave. Afterwards, they said he had eaten for ten days for free, scaring Wen Degui so much that he had to sell a sack of cabbage and turnips and carry it to the troupe as compensation. If that wasn't enough, the Farmers' Association director also asked Wen Degui to dye a red curtain, which he dared not refuse. It cost a total of 3,000 yuan. After dyeing it and sending it over, Hou Anqiu still complained that it wasn't dyed well and never paid him. Wen Degui didn't dare ask for the money. From its establishment last January to now, the troupe has wasted a total of 760,000 yuan in one year. This serious waste should have been dealt with long ago, but the Yongnian leadership is still telling them to continue. On January 11th of this year, District Cadre Li Chuanxu wrote a letter to Section Chief Zhang saying, "The village's theater troupe is quite good (?) The leader is the village Farmers' Association director... etc." I hope Comrade Li will quickly come to the village to understand the actual situation!

　　七里店滥用果实搞剧团
  　一年浪费七十多万编辑同志：
    永年四区七里店，群众没有彻底翻身，得了一点东西也给了剧团。去年正月，村农会主任侯安秋借口年关娱乐弄了个剧团。这个剧团，吃喝用具都是斗争果实和摊派的，演员还集体起火，吃了个把月，斗争出的十二亩地，也给了剧团，刚成立时，侯安秋提出叫大家“拥护拥护”，群众有的三百、有的二百、有的一千元。二十四户贫农分了一辆水车，为给剧团钱，就把水车卖了。剧团花完后，就又挨门挨户二百元派了一次。第三次是群众分的斗争果实洋，每户五百块的股，入了本村合作社，四个月每股分了二百元红利，在农会主任强说之下，又都给了剧团。第四次是群众分果实剩余的十三万元，存入本村合作社，他又弄到剧团，还偷卖农会分余果实大酒坛二个，卖了一万五千元；大槐树一棵一万二千元；水车一架三万五千元；大车脚子一付两万元。贫农侯牛子，从山西逃荒回却分不到东西，卖了斗争出的房一座出二万元，也给了剧团。贫农温德贵小孩去剧团学戏，住了十几天，剧团嫌笨不识字，叫退出了。之后，说他白吃十几天饭，吓得温德贵没法，给卖了一口袋白菜萝卜扛上送到剧团赔情，这还不算，农会主任又叫温德贵染一条红幕布，温不敢不染，共用三千元，染了送去以后，侯安秋还嫌染的不好，一直没有给钱，温德贵也不敢说要。剧团自去年一月成立到现在，一年共浪费了七十六万元。这种严重的浪费，早应该处理，但永年领导上还叫继续搞下去，在今年一月十一日，由区干李传绪给张科长写信说：“该村剧团比较不错（？）领导人由村农会主任负责………等”，希李同志速到本村了解了解实情吧！
