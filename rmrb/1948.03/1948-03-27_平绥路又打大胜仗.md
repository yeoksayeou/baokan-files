　　Great Victory Again on the Ping-Sui Railway
Following the successive victories on the Northeast, Northwest, Shandong, and Central Plains battlefields, our Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Sui armies launched a major offensive on the Ping-Sui Railway again. The Eastern Route cut off the Ping-Sui Railway, recovering the four county towns of Tianzhen, Yanggao, Weixian, and Guangling, as well as five stations including Julebao, controlling over a hundred miles of railway. The Western Route cut off the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, recovering the two cities of Huairen and Zuoyun. This offensive is still expanding victoriously.

　　平绥路又打大胜仗
    跟着咱们东北、西北、山东、中原各个战场连打胜仗以后，咱们晋察冀和晋绥两路大军又向平绥路展开了大攻势，东路切断了平绥路，收复天镇、阳高、蔚县、广灵四座县城，还有聚乐堡等五个车站，控制铁路百余里。西路切断了同蒲路北段，收复怀仁、左云两城。这个攻势还在胜利扩大中。
