　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th: Encouraged by the victorious great counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the people of various counties in southern Liaoning launched a wave of support for the front during the Lunar New Year. During the Anshan campaign, Haicheng County organized a large number of stretcher teams and carts, led by the county magistrate, to go to the front lines to participate in the war. Upon hearing the news of the capture of Liaoyang and Anshan, the liberated farmers of Datun, Xihai District, Fuxian County, immediately and spontaneously organized a stretcher team and went straight to the front lines. The stretcher team of Chaoyang Temple Village, Wan'jin County, lost its leader during the journey, but all members still arrived at the front lines on schedule to serve. In addition, more than 3,000 people in Haicheng were engaged in nursing, cooking, and guiding in the rear. The masses in the urban area and Nan'yao and other villages in the county continuously repaired a "counter-offensive bridge" that was sixty-six feet long and twenty-six feet wide for three consecutive days and nights from New Year's Eve to the third day of the new year to ensure the transportation of military supplies. Women in Mangou and Gushanzi villages were all rushing to grind rice for the front-line troops. Elementary schools in Wafangdian City voluntarily collected iron and steel and sent them to the arsenal. Fude Winter School and Guoguang Elementary School alone collected more than 12,000 catties. Various places in the county also enthusiastically provided supplies to comfort the troops, donating 8,800 catties of pork, more than 28,000 eggs, more than 1,800 boxes of cigarettes, and more than 800 catties of apples. When Wu, a 54-year-old man from Qiancao Tiehetun, was sending consolation items to the county seat, he was stunned by enemy bombing, but after regaining consciousness, he insisted on delivering them to the destination himself.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th: Around the Spring Festival, liberated farmers in eastern Liaoning, southern Liaoning, northern Liaoning, and Jilin once again launched a military recruitment movement led by hired peasants. According to incomplete statistics, more than 25,000 farmers in eastern and southern Liaoning flocked to the troops. Various places in eastern Liaoning proposed to organize counter-offensive regiments, battalions, and companies. In less than half a month, more than 3,700 young men and women in Xinjin County joined the army. When Xialuhe District of Kuandian held a hired peasant conference at the beginning of this month, it formed a counter-offensive regiment of more than 1,400 people on the spot. Litian District of Xi'an also held a military recruitment and Chiang extermination conference, and Jiguan Mountain District of Fengcheng established a counter-offensive standing army to prepare to enlist at any time. More than 12,700 people in Fuxian, Gaiping, Zhuanghe, Xiuyan, Yingkou, and Haicheng in southern Liaoning have signed up to join the army. A large number of young people in Jidong area, such as Yanji, Jiaohe, Helong, and Hunchun, also went to the front line. In mid-January, more than 540 hired peasants and middle peasants under the age of 30 in Yanji County participated in the troops after being reviewed by the masses. The military recruitment movement of farmers in the enemy-adjacent areas of Liaobei Province is also very high. Within more than a month after the liberation of 67 villages and towns around Xinmin, militia self-defense teams were established one after another, and more than 500 liberated farmers joined the People's Liberation Army.
