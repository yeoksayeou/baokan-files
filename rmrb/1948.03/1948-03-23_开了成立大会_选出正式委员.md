　　Inaugural Meeting Held, Formal Committee Members Elected
    On the morning of March 14th, the Poor Peasants' Association held its inaugural meeting. The entertainment team played music enthusiastically; everyone stood up solemnly and bowed three times to the portrait of Chairman Mao. The masses were in high spirits, and even a burst of snow did not distract them. This meeting was presided over by the initiators of the Poor Peasants' Association themselves. One of them was nominated to report on the significance of the meeting and the work of the initiators in the past few days, and another initiator made a supplementary report. The presidium, composed of the initiators, consulted, reminded, and helped each other during the meeting, while the work team comrades played a supporting role. These honest and loyal poor peasants initially seemed a bit unfamiliar on the rostrum; as the meeting progressed, twelve Poor Peasants' Association committee members and two alternate members were finally elected. When those elected (ten of whom were the original initiators) responded to the entrustment of the masses, their speech became very natural. Some of those elected were still worried about doing bad things and being criticized by the masses. Another committee member said, "In the future, let the masses decide everything, and we will do as they say. It's not like some cadres in the past who were arbitrary and dictatorial. How could we go wrong? If there are any small mistakes, we will correct them as soon as the masses point them out, and we won't accumulate big mistakes."

　　开了成立大会　选出正式委员
    三月十四日上午，贫农团开了成立大会。娱乐班吹吹打打热闹一番；全体起立庄重地向毛主席像行了三鞠躬礼。群众情绪都很好，下了一阵雪，他们在风雪中也没有涣散了注意力。这次会是由贫农团发起人自己主持，他们推举一个人报告开会意义和发起人几天里的工作，另一个发起人又作了补充报告，发起人组成的主席团在大会进行中互相商议、互相提示、互相帮助，工作组的同志处于辅助地位。这些老实忠厚的贫农，最初在主席台上还表现得有些生疏；大会进行下去，最后选举出十二个贫农团委员，两个候补委员。当选的人（其中有十个是原发起人），在答复群众嘱咐的时候，说话就已经很自然了。有的当选的人还怕办了坏事情受群众批评，另外一个委员就说：“以后啥事情都让群众决定了咱照着作，又不是象过去有些干部那样独断独行，还能会办错了？有点小错，群众啥时候指出来，咱啥时候改，也积不成大错。”
