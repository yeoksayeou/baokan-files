Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on February 28th, Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, sent a letter to Finnish President Paasikivi on February 22nd, suggesting that the Soviet Union and Finland conclude a mutual assistance treaty. The letter stated: "Our two countries suffered serious damage in the war against Hitler's aggression. If we allow that kind of aggression to happen again, we and you will be responsible to the people of our two countries in the future. I believe that concluding a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union to oppose possible German aggression is in the interest of Finland. And hoping to create conditions for fundamentally improving relations between our two countries in order to consolidate peace and security, the Soviet government proposes to conclude a Soviet-Finnish treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance. If Finland does not object, I suggest that Finland send a delegation to the Soviet Union to conclude the treaty. If you feel it is more convenient to negotiate and conclude the treaty in Finland, the Soviet government will be prepared to send a delegation to Helsinki."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. London Dispatch: At the end of February, the Anglo-Soviet Association held a grand gathering here to discuss "Anglo-Soviet Relations and Trade Issues." Participants in the conference included 227 units and 485 representatives from trade unions, cooperatives, United Nations associations, Labor Party organizations, and other groups. At the meeting, Balkin, chairman of the "Trade and Industry Group" of the Labor Party parliamentary group, proposed a motion requesting the meeting to discuss and approve it. The motion stated: The issues of British economic recovery and peace and security cannot be resolved without friendly and trade relations with the Soviet Union. In presenting the motion, Balkin emphasized the importance of friendship with the Soviet Union and criticized the anti-Soviet slanders in British public opinion and among upper-level political minds. White, General Secretary of the Civil Servants Association, supported the motion, saying that the British economic crisis can only be resolved by developing trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Leavett, General Secretary of the Insurance Industry Staff Association, said that the current British policy toward the Soviet Union is more hostile than ever before. Leavett pointed out that the purpose of the current anti-Soviet propaganda in Britain is to divert the attention of the British people and prevent them from paying attention to the serious situation in their own country. Harrison, a committee member of the Tobacco Workers' Alliance, pointed out in his speech: Friendship with the Soviet Union was a common phenomenon during the war, but now, when Soviet soldiers have rescued the people of all countries from the clutches of the Nazis, our authorities have turned against the Soviet Union. However, we must make it clear to our rulers: The working class is not ready to go to a new war, and the only thing the people want is peace. Balkin's motion was unanimously passed by the meeting.

    【新华社陕北三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二月二十八日电，苏联部长会议主席斯大林，于二月二十二日致函芬兰总统巴锡基维，建议苏芬缔结互助协定。该函略称：“我两国在反对希特勒侵略战争中，曾受到严重的损害，如果我们容许那种侵略重演，我们和你们将来就都应该对我们两国的人民负责。我认为与苏联缔结互助条约，以反对可能的德国侵略，是符合于芬兰的利益的。并希望为了巩固和平与安全，在我们两国间造成根本改善邦交的条件，苏联政府建议缔结苏芬友好合作互助条约。如果芬兰不反对，我就建议芬兰派代表团来苏缔约，如果你觉得在芬兰谈判缔约更方便的话，苏政府将准备派代表团去赫尔辛基。”
    【新华社陕北五日电】伦敦讯：二月底，英苏协会曾于此间召开一盛大集会，讨论“英苏邦交和贸易问题”。参加大会的包括职工会、合作社、联合国协会、工党组织及其他团体，共计二百二十七个单位，四百八十五名代表。会上，工党议会党团“贸易与工业组”主席巴尔金提出一项议案，要求会议讨论通过。该议案称：英国经济恢复问题及和平与安全问题，如果没有与苏联的友好和贸易关系，便不能解决。巴尔金在提出该议案时，强调与苏友好的重要性，并抨击英国舆论中及上层政治头脑们的反苏诽谤。公务员协会总书记怀特支持该议案称：英国经济危机，只有靠发展对苏联和对东欧的贸易，才能解决。保险业职员协会总书记莱瓦特称：现在英国对苏政策，比往日任何时候，都更含有敌意。莱氏指出：英国目前反苏宣传的目的，在于转移英国人民的视线，使其不去注意本国的严重情形。烟草工人同盟组织委员哈瑞森发言时指出：战时对苏友好是普遍现象，而今，当苏联战士把各国人民从纳粹魔爪下拯救出来之后，我们的当局却转而反苏。但是，我们必须对我们的统治者说清楚：工人阶级是不准备走向新战争的，人民所要的唯一东西，便是和平。巴尔金的议案，得到会议的一致通过。
