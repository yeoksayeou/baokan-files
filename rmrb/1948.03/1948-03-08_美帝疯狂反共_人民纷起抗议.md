Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 5th: New York dispatch: The American people are rising up in protest against the increasingly frenzied anti-communist and anti-people actions of the authorities. Following the arrest of American Communist leaders Bittleman and Williamson, Paul Bodos, a member of the Central Committee of the American Communist Party and leader of the Fur Workers Union, was also arrested in New York a few days ago. According to the Committee for the Protection of Foreign-Born, since October of last year, the Department of Justice has begun deporting progressive individuals in eleven states on the grounds of being communists, including ten prominent trade union leaders. At the same time, immigration authorities have imprisoned Williamson and other progressive individuals on Ellis Island, preventing them from being released on bail as usual and from speaking to reporters. A delegation of eighty leaders from the Philadelphia CIO and AFL protested this matter to Attorney General Clark. Joseph Curran, President of the National Maritime Union, wrote to Truman and Clark, denouncing this practice as a shameful attempt to weaken the workers' movement for higher wages and better working conditions. Lawyer Freedman condemned the denial of bail as "political persecution" and a violation of immigration law. In addition, many trade union officials, freelancers, and progressive individuals have also filed protests.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 6th: Various sources report: After the failure of their conspiracy in Czechoslovakia, the American reactionaries and their British and French running dogs are stepping up the formation of a military alliance-like "Western European Group," attempting to enslave the people of Western Europe and carry out anti-democratic conspiracies. According to a February 28th report from the London Daily Mail's New York correspondent, the United States is about to sign a so-called "defense" treaty with Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries, and is currently drafting the details. The new treaty is no different from the Bevin Plan, except that the United States will also openly participate. According to a TASS report on the 2nd, Washington officials have openly admitted that they hope that the "Marshall Plan countries" in Western Europe will form a thorough military alliance with the United States. A few days ago, French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet and U.S. Undersecretary of State Lovett met to discuss the many clauses proposed by Lovett to force the sixteen countries to accept in order to obtain "American aid," the main ones being the military clauses expressed in the recent statements made by Forrestal, Baruch, and Dulles. The British Communist Daily Worker commented on this, saying, "The U.S. government is now completing its war plan at the expense of the British and European people." It also stated: "Military control or so-called coordinated operations, using Western Europe and Britain as strategic bases, has always been the real goal of the Marshall Plan. The purpose of the 'Western Union' plan, such as the standardization of weapons, is to make Washington's victims stand submissively in line, awaiting further orders from the U.S. Army Department." The Daily Worker revealed that officials of the Labour government, Labour MPs, and the Daily Herald are actively promoting Britain's leading role in the "Western Union," attempting to make the British people obediently accept this war plan. The Daily Worker hinted that the British and Western European people should be extremely vigilant about the activities of war-mongers such as Attlee and Bevin.

　　美帝疯狂反共
  　人民纷起抗议
    【新华社陕北五日电】纽约讯：美国人民纷起抗议当局日益疯狂的反共反人民行动。继美共领袖毕特曼、威廉逊之后，美共中央委员兼毛皮工会领袖鲍达斯，又于日前在纽约被捕。据外国出生者保护委员会称：自去年十月以来，司法部就以共产党员为罪名，开始放逐十一个州的进步人士，其中有十位著名的工会领袖。同时移民当局竟将威廉逊及其他进步人士监禁在艾里斯岛上，不准照惯例交保释放及对记者谈话。费城产联与劳联领袖八十人组成之代表团，特为此事向司法部长克拉克提出抗议。运输工人工会主席奎尔写信给杜鲁门与克拉克，怒斥这种作法，是想削弱争取较高工资与较好工作条件的工人运动之可耻企图，律师佛莱德曼斥责拒绝保释是一种“政治迫害”，并且违反移民法。此外，很多工会职员，自由职业者与进步人士，亦纷纷提出抗议。
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方讯：美反动派及其英法走卒，在捷克阴谋失败之后，正加紧筹组军事同盟性质的“西欧集团”，妄图奴役西欧人民；并进行反民主的阴谋活动。据伦敦每日邮报驻纽约记者二月二十八日透露：美国要和英、法、比、荷等国签订所谓“防御”条约，现正草拟详细内容，新条约与贝文计划毫无二致，不同的是美国也将公开参加。据塔斯社二日报导：华盛顿官员已公开承认希望西欧“马歇尔计划各国”与美国成立彻头彻尾的军事同盟。日前，法驻美大使庞纳与美副国务卿罗维特会商，罗维特提出强令十六国接受获取“美援”的许多条款，其中主要的是表现在福莱斯特尔、巴鲁区与杜勒斯最近所作的声明中的军事性质的条款。英共工人日报对此评称：“美政府现在正以英国和欧洲人民为代价，完成其战争计划”。并称：“军事控制或所谓配合作战，利用西欧和英国作为战略基地，一直就是马歇尔计划的真正目标。‘西方联盟’计划的目的，例如武器标准化，就是使华盛顿的牺牲者卑躬地站队，等待美国陆军部进一步的命令”。工人日报揭露工党政府官员，工党议员和每日先驱报，正积极宣传，英国在“西方联盟”中所居的领导地位，企图使英国人民驯从地接受这个战争计划。工人日报暗示英国和西欧人民，万分警惕艾德礼、贝文之流战争贩子的活动。
