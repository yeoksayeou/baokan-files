　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Implement Grain Rationing
  　Shanghai Rice Rises to 3.6 Million Per Load
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th] According to news from domestic and foreign news agencies: Shanghai rice prices have risen sharply after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits implemented "grain rationing" for a week. On the 6th of this month, each load had risen to an unprecedented peak of 3.6 million Chiang Kai-shek currency, 360,000 times that of the pre-war level, and other commodity prices also rose. According to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' "grain rationing" system, a total of more than 350,000 tons of grain (approximately 160 million jin) from American "relief" grain and other sources are "rationed" in the five major cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou for four months. The Shanghai "rationing" began on the 1st of this month, with only 15 jin rationed per person per month, and the selling price is only 5% lower than the black market rice price. It is widely believed that this surge in rice prices was intentionally created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, with the purpose of making the so-called "rationing" system appear as if Shanghai citizens could get a "discount" of 5%, while in reality they pay a much higher price than before, so that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits can make huge profits from the large amount of grain obtained from the American imperialists.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th] According to Reuters: On the 5th of this month, prices on Shanghai's financial and stock markets broke records again. The black market exchange rate for the US dollar has risen to 355,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency per dollar, an increase of more than 118,000 times compared to the pre-war rate (a ratio of 3 to 1). Gold has risen to 22.25 million Chiang Kai-shek currency per tael, more than 24 times the highest price of 900,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency during the "gold rush" in February last year. The stock market on the 4th also rose by 15% to 20% compared to the 3rd, with foreign stocks rising the most sharply. Commodity prices also continued to rise sharply, with the prices of export commodities exceeding those on overseas markets by 100%, leading to a sharp decline in exports. Although the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have implemented "grain rationing" in Shanghai since this month, and more than 20,000 tons of American "relief" rice will be shipped, the price of rice per load still remains high at 3 million.

　　蒋匪实行粮食配售
  　沪米每担涨到三百六十万
    【新华社陕北九日电】据中外通讯社消息：上海米价在蒋匪实行“粮食配售”一周后，反猛烈上涨。本月六日每担已涨达蒋币三百六十万元之空前高峰，为战前的三十六万倍，其他物价也纷纷上涨。按蒋匪“粮食配售”制度，系以美国“救济”粮食和其他来源的粮食共三十五万余吨（约一亿六千多万市斤），在上海、南京、北平、天津、广州五大城市分四个月“配售”，沪市“配售”已于本月一日开始，每人每月仅配售十五斤，售价仅较黑市米价低百分之五。众信此次米价暴涨，系蒋匪有意造成，目的在使所谓“配给”制，表面上上海市民可得“减价”百分之五的“小惠”，而实际上则付出较前远为高昂的代价，俾蒋匪能从美帝获得之大批米粮中牟取厚利。
    【新华社陕北七日电】据路透社讯：上海金融与股票市场价格本月五日又突破纪录。美金黑市已涨到每元换蒋币三十五万五千元，较战前（三与一之比）上涨十一万八千余倍。黄金每两涨到两千二百二十五万元，较去年二月“黄金潮”中九十万元的最高价，上涨二十四倍以上。股票市场四日亦较三日涨百分之十五到二十，其中以外国股票上涨最烈。百货价格亦继续猛涨，其中出口商品的价格已高出国外市场百分之百，致出口额猛烈下降。蒋匪虽已自本月起在上海实行“粮食配给”，且二万余吨美国“救济”米又将运到，但米价每担仍高踞三百万。
