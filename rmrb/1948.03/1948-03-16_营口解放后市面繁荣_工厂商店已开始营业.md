Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th—Yingkou, an important port in Liaodong Bay, has thrived since its liberation. The democratic government immediately began its work. District governments were established one after another and actively engaged in appeasement work, quickly restoring order. The democratic government also issued a special notice to effectively protect industry and commerce, and convened a meeting of factory managers in the city, explaining that private industry and commerce, except for enemy and puppet bureaucratic capital, would be protected and supported for their development. The city's cotton mill resumed operations on the 2nd, and various shops reopened one after another, boosting the market. Farmers from the surrounding countryside continuously transport grain into the city, causing grain prices to fall rapidly. The price of sorghum has fallen from 700 to 400 yuan per catty (斤 - a Chinese unit of weight). The post office is operating as usual, telephone lines are clear, and long-distance calls can reach Liaoyang, Wafangdian, and other places. The "Liaonan Daily," the largest newspaper in the Liaonan liberated area, is in short supply and is sold out every day. The mass bookstore sells books and periodicals from the liberated areas, and business is booming. "Land Reform and Practice" is the most popular book.

　　营口解放后市面繁荣
  　工厂商店已开始营业
    【新华社东北十三日电】辽东湾要港营口解放后，民主政府即开始办公。各区政府相继成立，积极从事安抚工作，秩序迅即恢复。民主政府并特布告，切实保护工商业，及召开市内各工厂经理会议，说明除敌伪官僚资本外，对私人工商业，一律加以保护，并扶植其发展。现市内纱厂已于二日复工，各商店相继复业，市面繁荣。四乡农民源源运粮入市，粮价急速下降。高粱每斤由本币七百元降至四百元，邮局照常办公，电话畅通，长途电话已可通达辽阳、瓦房店各地。辽南解放区最大报纸“辽南日报”供不应求，每日均为抢购一空。群众书店销售解放区书刊，生意兴隆，以“土地改革与实践”一书最受欢迎。
