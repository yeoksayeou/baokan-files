　　[Taiyue News] The Yuebei Special District, in order to accelerate spring ploughing preparations, has issued a call that states, in brief: Spring ploughing has now arrived, and many farmers do not understand the Land Law. Some are being deceived by the propaganda of landlords and rich peasants, and are not enthusiastic about production. For example, some people believe that the land will be "divided up evenly," and some middle peasants don't know "how" their land will be "leveled"? They are afraid that if they work hard, others will "level" it away, so they don't want to move; some poor peasants are thinking of waiting until after the leveling before moving; and some are eating and drinking extravagantly instead of working hard. If you don't produce properly and waste your own things, you will suffer greatly from lack of food and clothing in the future. Now the government is responsible for declaring a few points, please rest assured: (1) In old and semi-old areas, because only supplementary adjustments are being carried out, and the number of farmers who need land is not large, and the amount of land they need is not much, the general land changes will not be large. (2) During supplementary adjustments, the movable property, houses, livestock, and farm implements, clothing and other internal property of middle peasants will not be touched. If some of the land of richer middle peasants is to be taken, the consent of the middle peasants and themselves must be obtained, and there must be no coercion. (3) The land that is now planted will be harvested by whoever plants it. When supplementary adjustments are made to the land, the crops planted will also be harvested by the planter, and the crops will not be taken away with the land. (4) Because spring ploughing has arrived, supplementary adjustments will not be carried out in the old and semi-old areas before spring ploughing. Everyone should concentrate on production: (1) Immediately restore and rectify mutual aid teams. (2) After being organized, immediately seize the time to transport manure, prepare the land, dig ditches, build embankments, and repair canals. (3) Use the winter production loans from last year and the money earned through turnover to organize the purchase of livestock. Now we must pay attention to preventing epidemics and strictly prohibit slaughter. (4) Areas planting indigo, cotton, and tobacco should quickly prepare seeds and select areas. (5) Plant trees widely during the Qingming Festival. Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi counties should first solve the spring famine due to the disturbances of the Yan bandits.

　　岳北专署号召加紧准备春耕
    【太岳消息】岳北专署为了加紧春耕准备，特发出号召略称：现在春耕已经到来，有不少农民对土地法有的不了解，有的是受了一些地主富农的欺骗宣传，生产都闹的不起劲。比如有的人认为是要把地都“打乱平分”，有些中农户认为不知道“平”他那一块地？怕劳动了又叫旁人“平”走，不想动弹；也有些贫苦农民想着等平分了再动弹；也有的大吃大喝不好好劳动。这样不好好生产，又把自己的东西浪费了，将来少吃缺穿还是自己吃大亏。现在政府负责声明几点请大家放心：（一）在老区和半老区因只是进行抽补，按现在需要补地的农民也不多了，他们要补的地也用不多少，所以一般的土地的变动不会大。（二）抽补时中农的浮财、房屋、牲畜、农具衣物等内产不动，如果要抽些富裕中农的土地时，也一定要取得中农及本人的自愿，不能强迫。（三）现在种下的地谁种归谁收，抽补地的时候种下的庄稼也归种地人收，不连庄稼抽走。（四）因为春耕已到，在老区半老区春耕以前抽补也不进行。大家要安心生产：（一）马上恢复整顿互助组。（二）在组织起来以后立即抓紧时间送粪、整地、刨边、垒堰、修理渠道。（三）要把去年的冬季生产贷款和大家周转赚下的钱，组织买牲口，现在要注意防止瘟疫严禁宰杀。（四）种蓝种棉种烟叶的地方要赶快准备种子选定地区。（五）清明节普遍种树。平遥、介休、灵石三县，由于阎匪的扰害，应先解决春荒。
