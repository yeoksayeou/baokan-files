　　Step Up Disaster Relief Through Work Relief
  　Border Government Continues to Allocate Relief Grain

    [Reported by this newspaper] To relieve the famine, the Border Region Government had previously allocated 7.3 million jin of relief grain. To enhance disaster relief efforts, another 2.7 million jin of relief grain has been allocated. This is divided as follows: 800,000 jin to the Taihang Region, 500,000 jin to the Taiyue Region, 700,000 jin to Southern Hebei, and 700,000 jin to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region. This relief grain will primarily continue to be used for work relief, combining disaster relief with construction efforts.
