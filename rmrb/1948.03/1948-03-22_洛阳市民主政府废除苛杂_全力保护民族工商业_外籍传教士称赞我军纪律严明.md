    Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 20th: The Luoyang Municipal Democratic Government is making every effort to protect national industry and commerce. In addition to confiscating the bureaucratic capital of the four major families, all privately-run factories and shops are operating as usual under strict protection. Currently, the Jinan currency is circulating smoothly in the market at an exchange rate of one to thirty against the Chiang currency. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has also established a currency exchange to facilitate currency circulation in the market. All kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies have also been explicitly abolished. According to investigations, when the Anti-Japanese War was won in 1945, there were approximately 2,500 shops in Luoyang. Now there are less than 1,000, most of which were forced to close down due to the unbearable tax burden imposed by the Chiang bandits. The existing shops are also struggling to survive.

    Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 20th: After the liberation of Luoyang, the People's Liberation Army properly protected the Catholic Church and missionaries at the East Railway Station. The Luoyang Municipal Democratic Government immediately posted notices to protect churches and foreigners after the battle ended. The sixty-year-old Italian Bishop of the Luoyang region (which governs sixteen counties in western Henan), Bartolomeo Bucci (transliteration), praised the People's Liberation Army for its strict discipline and genuine implementation of the policy of religious freedom, and was particularly grateful for such measures by the democratic municipal government. Speaking to reporters in fluent Chinese, he said: "The government's (referring to the Chiang regime) exorbitant taxes and levies are too heavy. Many people in Luoyang have long been unable to make a living. Your arrival is a salvation for the people." Father Gioacchino Besi (transliteration), the Italian director of the hospital affiliated with the church, said, "I heard from people from the Xuchang church that the People's Liberation Army has good discipline. Therefore, I remained in the church when the People's Liberation Army attacked the city this time. Sure enough, you are very good." Father Gu and Brother Wei also repeatedly praised the People's Liberation Army and said, "Now the people of the whole world are asking for a peaceful life. Chiang Kai-shek should not have launched a war again after peace."

    洛阳市民主政府废除苛杂
  　全力保护民族工商业
    外籍传教士称赞我军纪律严明
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十日电】洛阳市民主政府全力保护民族工商业。除将四大家族之官僚资本予以没收外，凡属私人经营之工厂、商店，均在严密保护下，照常营业。现冀南币以一比蒋币三十之比值在市面畅通。市府工商管理局并设有货币兑换所，便利货币流通市面，各项苛捐杂税亦经明令废除。据调查，一九四五年抗战胜利时，洛市原有商店约二千五百家，现存者不到一千家，大半均因不堪蒋匪捐税负担被迫停业。现存之商店，亦奄奄一息。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十日电】洛阳解放后人民解放军对东车站的天主教堂及传教士妥为保护。洛阳市民主政府，并于战斗结束后，立即张贴保护教堂及外侨的布告。六十多岁的义大利籍洛阳区主教（辖豫西十六县）巴友仁（译音）盛赞解放军纪律严明，真正执行宗教自由政策，对民主市政府此种措施尤为感激。他以极熟练的中国话对记者说：“政府（按指蒋政权）的苛捐杂税太重，洛阳很多的人民早已生活不下去了，你们来了，人民就得救了”。该教堂附设医院院长义籍饶本原（译音）说：“我听到从许昌教堂来人说，解放军纪律很好，所以解放军此次攻城时，我仍留在教堂内，果然你们好得很”。谷司铎、魏修士等，亦连口称赞解放军，并且说：“现在全世界的人民都要求过和平生活，蒋介石不该在和平之后又来发动战争”。
