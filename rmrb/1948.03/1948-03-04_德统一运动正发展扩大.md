Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Comprehensive Berlin dispatch: The movement against the division of Germany and for the unification of the whole of Germany is continuing to develop. Recently, Grotewohl, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, emphasized in a speech at a meeting of party cadres in Greater Berlin that the People's Congress must now begin to take action, and pointed out that the upcoming Second German People's Congress for German unification and a just peace should not only put forward political demands, but must also fulfill the entrustment of the entire German people. The German Communist Party in the Ruhr area held its third Congress in Lickinghausen on February 25th, with more than 800 representatives attending. Liedwin, the first chairman of the German Communist Party in the Ruhr area, claimed that the German Communist Party had become the most important political factor in the industrial center cities of Germany, and pointed out that the Ruhr area had become a staging ground for the implementation of the Marshall Plan, and the basic task of the German Communist Party was to launch a struggle for national unification and a just peace. According to a TASS report on the 25th, the recent Berlin Second People's Congress resolved to call on the people of the Allied occupation zones to rise up against the division of Germany and the establishment of a West German government. The Congress also elected 212 representatives to attend the Second All-German People's Congress. The reactionary policy of Social Democratic Party bureaucrats to split Germany is causing increasing dissatisfaction among its members. Seventy-two Social Democrats disregarded the ban of the party leadership and participated in the Berlin People's Congress, dedicating themselves to the German People's Congress movement.

A characteristic of the new cabinet is that in addition to the army, representatives from the air force and navy are also participating, making the atmosphere of military fascist dictatorship even stronger. Deputy Prime Minister Pramoj (Deputy Chairman of the "Democratic" Party) changed from concurrently serving as Minister of Justice to concurrently serving as Minister of Education.
