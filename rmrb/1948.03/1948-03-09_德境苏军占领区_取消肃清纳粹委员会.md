　　Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany
  　Abolishes Committee for Purging Nazis
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Berlin dispatch: On February 26th, Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander of the Soviet forces in Germany, issued an order to dissolve the Committee for Purging Nazis in the Soviet Occupation Zone, effective March 10th. The order pointed out that since the committee had completed its task of purging active former fascists and militarists from administrative organs, and since the anti-fascist and democratic order had been firmly established in the Soviet Occupation Zone, under these conditions, the Soviet Occupation Zone could more broadly absorb lower-level fascist party members who had not been tainted by criminal acts to participate in economic and democratic construction work, so that they could redeem their past mistakes in participating in fascist organizations through loyal labor. This is entirely in line with the interests of restoring and developing the peaceful economy of the Soviet Occupation Zone and further striving for the unification and democratization of Germany. Hereafter, cases involving war and fascist criminals will be handled by the German Criminal Police and courts. In contrast, the British Occupation Zone, which has always been known for Nazis occupying important government positions and anti-democracy, immediately issued a reactionary order releasing Nazi criminals, secret police, SS, and Nazi leadership groups in the zone.

　　德境苏军占领区
  　取消肃清纳粹委员会
    【新华社陕北五日电】柏林讯：二月二十六日，德境苏军司令索柯罗夫斯基元帅发布命令，自三月十日起解散苏占区之肃清纳粹委员会。命令指出：由于该委员会已完成他们清洗行政机构中前法西斯积极分子及军国主义分子的任务，以及反法西斯与民主秩序已在苏占区稳固地建立起来，在这些条件下，苏占区可以更广泛地吸收未曾沾染罪恶污点的法西斯下层党员参加经济民主建设工作，使他们能以忠诚劳动来赎取过去参加法西斯组织的错误。这是完全符合恢复与发展苏占区和平经济及进一步争取德国统一与民主化斗争的利益的。以后有关战争与法西斯罪犯的案件，将由德国刑事警察与法庭来处理。与此相反，一向以纳粹分子盘踞政府要职及反民主著称的英占区，随即发布了一道释放该区纳粹罪犯、秘密警察、党卫军及纳粹领导集团的反动命令。
