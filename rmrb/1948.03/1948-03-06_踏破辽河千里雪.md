　　"Brother Troops"
　　Around the New Year, I followed the army across the frozen Liao River plain. On the open fields, the troops stretched as far as the eye could see. Day and night, the rolling sounds of footsteps and artillery vehicles carved out broad avenues across the boundless snow, with the vast army pointing towards Shenyang. Those who have not personally experienced the "Three Down the South of the Yangtze" and "Four Defenses of Linjiang" campaigns can hardly comprehend the full emotion behind the phrase "Here come the brother troops!" In December of the year before last, the Chiang bandits were still raving, "We'll spend the New Year in Harbin!" The troops defending the people's Northeast capital were busy blowing up the iron bridges on the north bank of the Songhua River, removing the rails, and digging anti-tank trenches on the frozen highways. The People's Liberation Army, isolated in the small corner of Linjiang in southern Manchuria, was under attack by enemies several times their size. Many soldiers had not yet put on cotton clothes, and they huddled beside collapsed mountain horse sheds covered in ice and snow, eating frozen rice balls. "Four counties, one mountain peak, and two barren gullies" was all the territory they held, while the enemy launched their fourth fierce offensive with a superior force of nine divisions. When the sky still seemed dark, when holding the southern Manchuria area seemed impossible, the soldiers had only one cry: "Fight our way out!" They were determined to smash the enemy into pieces, believing that the brother troops in northern Manchuria would come to their aid, because the people on the north bank of the Songhua River also had only one cry: "Fight our way out!" It was this heroic spirit of the people's army that broke through the most difficult days, moving the Northeast battlefield from the banks of the Songhua River and the foothills of Changbai Mountain to the Liao River plain. The brother troops, separated for a year, finally met at the gates of Shenyang! "Look, it's the northern Manchuria veterans who fought the New First Army!" "Look, it's the 'Tiger Killers' (the bandit New Sixth Army called themselves the 'Tiger威Troops'), the nemesis of the New Sixth Army!" The soldiers talked as they marched, and although enemy planes were tracking and strafing from the sky, people could not suppress their jubilation at the reunion.
　　"General Lin Biao's Soldiers"
　　The hinterland of Shenyang is full of dense villages, but they were all filled with the PLA soldiers gathered from all directions. We changed our campsites three times but couldn't find a place to stay, finally finding shelter in a courtyard full of people. A company commander immediately gathered his troops and said, "How about we all sleep on the floor tonight and give the warm kang (heated brick bed) to the brother troops?" A loud "Okay!" echoed throughout the yard. We were then ushered into the warm house, where they vied to brush the snow off our bodies and knock off the snow chunks from our ＠＠. They asked us about our experience in wiping out the enemy's "ace troops" (referring to the New First and New Sixth Armies). A political instructor who had participated in the defense of Linjiang introduced his company's equipment to me: "The New Sixth Army has two submachine guns per squad, our squad leader and team leader each have one. They have nine American-made light machine guns per company, we have twelve, also made by their daddy America. They have two 60mm mortars per company, we also have two. But they don't have grenade launchers!" This company had captured two thousand four hundred and fourteen enemies, seized fifty-two machine guns, one hundred and fifteen submachine guns, nine rocket launchers, nine mortars, seven 60mm mortars, and six hundred and sixty-two rifles and pistols in the past year, earning the glorious title of "Dongfeng Company" and producing one hundred and forty-nine people's heroes. The political instructor's conclusion was: "General Lin (the affectionate name of the soldiers for General Lin Biao) means victory. Now that our Fourth Manchurian Army has joined forces, a great victory is at hand!"
　　"Three Down the South of the Yangtze"
　　Taking a big step backward, then a big step forward, retreating from southern Manchuria to north of the Songhua River, and then fighting from north of the river to the Liao River plain – what a long journey that must have been! The soldiers, in the freezing cold of minus forty degrees, sometimes had to walk one hundred and several tens of miles a day. The blood from the cracks and blisters on their feet soaked through their felt socks and froze into ice. They often couldn't even get a single meal a day, but they had no complaints. Their personal experience made them firmly believe that if they could walk, they could fight well. "Be a hero in battle, be an iron-legged general in marching" was a vow that spread throughout the army.
　　This year's snowfall on the Liao River was the heaviest in seven or eight years. The thousand-mile plain did not reveal a single patch of yellow earth. The wind swept up the snow, burying the roads that had been cleared, but the rolling army still flowed through, using their feet to tread out new paths. ＠＠ were torn, so they walked barefoot, preferring to stumble and fall in the snowdrifts rather than leave the ranks. The brave warriors had only one determination: "Wherever General Lin points, we will fight!"
　　"The People's Backbone"
　　At the expedition oath-taking rally, a newly liberated soldier named Yi Xiaohu walked to the spirits of his parents, who had been killed by Chiang Kai-shek, and cried as loudly as everyone else: "Father, your death was so unjust! The Kuomintang seized soldiers, and you paid interest money three times to buy me out, but the fourth time you couldn't afford it anymore. I was only three miles from home when you were forced to death! I don't even know where you're buried now! Now the Communist Party has rescued me, and I've joined my own ranks. I must avenge you! I can't face you if I don't eliminate the Chiang bandits!" The fire of revenge turned him into "the people's backbone." On the battlefield, a tree stump pierced his foot from the sole all the way through the back, but he didn't tell anyone, carrying his machine gun and charging forward as usual, following the march. The wound had already festered, and his foot was so swollen that he couldn't wear his shoe. He walked barefoot, not falling behind a single step, and even helped others carry heavy machine guns. The squad leader insisted on looking at his foot and found that the flesh of the wound was completely rotten, filled with sand. The medic asked him, "Why didn't you say anything earlier?" He said, "If I had said something earlier, would I still be able to fight? Would I still be able to avenge my father myself?" The next day, during the march, everyone forced him onto the ambulance, but he slowly climbed down and caught up with the ranks again, with only a bandage wrapped around his foot, and persevered for three days of marching.
　　"Not afraid of snow or wind, can't stop me from avenging and making meritorious service!" "You can freeze my skin, freeze my flesh, but you can't freeze the backbone of my Communist Party member!" This was the expedition oath that echoed throughout the army. The red "gun stock inscriptions" on the weapons wrote each soldier's hatred and determination: "See blood with my bayonet and swear to avenge my father!" "Eliminate the archenemy, avenge our blood and tears!" Liberated soldiers wanted to atone for their sins by making meritorious contributions and returning to their hometown to settle accounts. Emancipated peasant soldiers wanted to uproot the root of hatred that was Chiang Kai-shek, protect the fields, protect their homes, liberate all the poor brothers in the world, and strive to become a glorious Mao Zedong soldier. The peasants who had just put down their hoes and the Chiang army soldiers who had recently been captured were transformed into invincible heroes! The people's army, traversing the Liao River plain, broke through a thousand miles of snowy wilderness, attacking Zhangwu, Xinlitun, Liaoyang, and Anshan, entering the satellite strongholds of Shenyang, and钳住the throat of the Beining Railway, creating even greater victories for 1948 wherever their footsteps reached.

　　踏破辽河千里雪
    新华社记者华山
　　“兄弟部队”
    新年前后记者随军横跨冰冻的辽河平原，在开阔的原野上部队从头望不见尾，日夜滚滚的脚步声、炮车声，在无边的雪地上，闯开一条条坦阔的大道，千军万马指向沈阳。不时听到战士们这样欢呼：“看兄弟部队来了！”没有亲身经历“三下江南”和“四保临江”的人，很难体会到这句话的全部感情。前年十二月间，蒋匪还狂吠着：“到哈尔滨过年！”保卫人民的东北首府的部队，正在炸毁松花江北岸的铁桥，拔掉铁轨，在冰冻的公路上挖掘防御坦克的壕沟。而被隔绝在南满临江一隅的解放军，则遭到数倍于己的敌人猛扑，那时，许多人还没有穿上棉衣，战士们挤在冰雪压坍的荒山马棚边吃着冰饭团，“四个县城，一座山头，两道荒沟”，这就是所有的地区，而敌人又以九个师的优势兵力作第四次猛犯。当天空似乎还是黑暗的时候，当坚持南满地区似乎绝不可能的时候，战士们只有一个呼声：“打出去！”他们决心要把敌人碰个七零八落，他们相信北满兄弟部队会打过来的，因为在松花江北岸的人们也只有一个呼声：“打出去！”正是这种人民军队的英雄气概，冲破了最艰难的日子，把东北战场从松花江畔和长白山麓移到辽河平原，隔绝了一年的兄弟部队，终于到沈阳的大门口会师了！“看这是打新一军的北满老大哥！”“看这就是新六军的死对头‘打虎能手’（匪新六军自称‘虎威部队’）！”战士们边走边谈，虽然天空中敌机正在跟踪扫射，但人们也按不住见面时的狂欢。
　　“林彪将军的战士们”
    沈阳腹地不乏稠密的大村庄，但都驻满了四面八方汇集而来的解放军健儿们，我们改变了三次宿营地也找不到住处，最后只好到一个住满了人的院子里稍避避风。一个连长立刻集合队伍说：“咱们今晚全睡地铺把热炕让给兄弟部队好不好？”满院响起了一声：“好啊！”我们便被他们拥到暖房里，他们争着给我们扫身上的雪花，敲打＠＠上的雪块，问我们歼灭敌人“王牌军（指新一、新六军）”的经验。一个参加过保卫临江的连指导员向我介绍他这连队的装备：“新六军一个班两支冲锋式、咱们班长，组长各拿一支，它一个连九挺美式轻机枪，咱有十二挺，也是他爸爸的美国造，它一连两门六○炮，咱也两门，咱们的掷弹筒它可没有哩！”这个连一年来俘虏敌人二、四一四名，缴获机枪五十二挺、冲锋式一一五支、火箭炮九门、迫击炮九门、六○炮七门、长短枪六六二支创造了“东丰连”的光荣称号，出现了一四九个人民功臣。这位指导员的结论是：“林总（指战员对林彪将军的亲密称呼）就是胜利，现在咱们四满大军来会合，大胜利就在眼前了！”
　　“三下江南”
    大踏步后退，大踏步前进，从南满撤退到松花江北，又从江北打到辽河平原，这该是多么遥远的路途啊！战士们在零下四十度的冰天雪地里，有时一天要走一百几十里路，脚上裂口血泡的血水浸透了毡袜，又冻成冰，整天还吃不上一顿饭，但是他们毫无怨言，亲身的体验使他们坚信：能走路就能打好仗，“打仗要做英雄汉，行军要做铁腿将”，这是遍及全军的誓言。
    今年辽河大雪为七八年来所未有，千里平原不露一片黄土，风刮起遍野积雪，把踏开的大道埋没了，而滚滚雄师还是川流而过，用双脚踏出新的道路，＠＠踏破了，光着脚走，宁肯在雪窝着跌来摔去，不愿离开队伍一步，勇士们只有一个决心：“林总指到那里，就打到那里！”
  　“人民的硬骨头”
    在出征宣誓大会上有一个名叫伊小虎的新解放战士，走到全连被蒋介石杀害的父母灵前，和大家一样的大哭起来：“父亲你死的大冤啊！国民党抓兵，你出过三次行利钱买我，可是第四次你再买不起。我离家三里路，你就叫逼死了，你现在埋在那里，我都不知道啊！现在共产党把我救出来了，我参加自己的队伍了，我非给您报仇不可，不消灭蒋贼，我对不住你啊！”复仇怒火，使他变成“人民的硬肯头。”战场上，他叫树楂子从脚心扎透脚背，但他没让人知道，扛着机枪照样冲锋，跟着行军。伤口已经化脓，脚肿得穿不上鞋，他光脚走，没掉下一步，一拐拐的还替旁人扛重机枪。班长硬要看他的脚，才发现伤口肉全烂了，坏肉里塞满砂子。卫生员问他：“为什么早不说？”他说：“我早说了，还捞上打仗吗？还能亲自给父亲报仇？”第二天行军，大家硬把他拉上病号车，他慢慢地爬下来又追上队伍，脚上只缠条绷带，坚持了三天行军。
    “不怕你下雪刮风，挡不住我复仇立功！”“你能冻坏我的皮，冻坏我的肉，冻不坏我共产党员的硬骨头！”这是响遍全军的出征誓言。武器上红色的“枪托铭”写着每个战士的仇恨和决心：“刺刀见血誓报父仇！”“消灭死对头，要报血泪仇！”解放战士要立功赎罪打回老家算总帐，翻身农民战士要挖掉蒋介石这仇根，保田保家乡，解放天下穷哥儿们，争取做一个光荣的毛泽东战士。刚刚放下锄头的农民和被俘不久的蒋军士兵，就这样变成所向无敌的英雄！纵横辽河平原的人民军队就这样突破了千里雪野，打彰武、打新立屯、打辽阳、打鞍山、进入沈阳的卫星要点，钳住北宁线的咽喉地区，在足迹所到之处，为一九四八年创造更大的胜利。
