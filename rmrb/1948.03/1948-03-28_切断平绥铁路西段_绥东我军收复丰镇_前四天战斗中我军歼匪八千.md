　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 26th: The Jin-Sui People's Liberation Army recovered Fengzhen County in eastern Sui at 8:00 PM on the 22nd. The Fu bandits guarding the city fled towards Jining. Fengzhen is on the Ping-Sui Railway, with a population of approximately 50,000, and is the largest city in eastern Sui. This is the first recovery since the People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew on September 19th of the year before last. From now on, the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway will also be cut off.

　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: In the battles to capture the towns and stations of Tianzhen and Yanggao from the 21st to the 24th, the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army annihilated the entire Fu bandit's 31st Training Division and 17th Training Division, a part of the reorganized 11th Cavalry Brigade, and the entire Pseudo-Yanbei Security Second Regiment and the Pseudo-Police Team of Guangling County, totaling over 8,000 people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 26th: The liberated peasants in Daixian, Shanyin, Huairen, Zuoyun, Pinglu and other places in northern Jin, after undergoing ideological education of "speaking out bitterness" and "digging out the roots of poverty," have greatly improved their awareness and have launched a surge of sending their sons and encouraging their husbands to join the army to defend their fruits of victory. In Shanyin's third and fifth districts alone, more than 230 young peasants joined the army. Wang Yongde, a poor peasant in Wangjiajian Village, was the first to sign up his nephew for the army after being allocated land. In Yangmingbao Town, Daixian County, three batches of young people, totaling 48, joined the army. When Liu, an old woman from Yangshupo, Pinglu, sent her son to join the army, she said, "I feel honored that my son is a soldier in the Liberation Army. We have been allocated land and cattle, and we should protect it ourselves." The soldiers who joined the army this time have all been vetted by the farmers' associations and the masses, and are mostly liberated young peasants aged 18 to 25. Peasants in various places used grand folk rituals to send off the new soldiers to the camp, and women sewed satchels, shoes, and socks as gifts, embroidering them with words such as "kill the enemy and make meritorious service" and "defend the fruits of victory."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 26th: The Jizhong Military Region recently issued a circular commending the local armed forces of Daxing and Qingyuan counties. The circular pointed out: (1) On February 18th, the entire 4th Cavalry Division of the Chiang-Fu bandits and four regiments of the 92nd Army and one regiment of the 16th Army, a total of eight regiments, carried out a combined "encirclement and suppression" in the area within a 30-li radius of Gu'an and Anci, north of the Yongding River. The local armed forces of Daxing County immediately maneuvered and withdrew from the enemy's encirclement, causing the enemy's main force to attack empty space. The next day, the enemy tracked and pursued them to Liujiapu (30 li northwest of Gu'an), and the local armed forces of the county immediately counterattacked, killing or wounding more than 30 enemy soldiers and horses, and then safely transferred, completely thwarting the enemy's attempt. They created a model of a small force smashing the enemy's large group encirclement in the enemy's depth. (2) In the next month of February, the Qingyuan local armed forces attacked the Chiang bandit army in Dafu Village, south of Baoding, and other places. In one week, they fought three battles, annihilating 117 enemies and capturing five machine guns and 50 rifles and carbines, creating a model of accumulating small victories into great victories.

    【本报特讯】据新华社讯：晋察冀人民解放军于二十一日至二十四日攻克天镇、阳高等城镇车站战斗中，歼灭傅匪补训三十一师及补训十七师全部、整编骑兵十一旅一部，及伪雁北保安第二团广灵县伪保警队全部等八千余人。

    【新华社晋察冀二十六日电】冀中军区顷通令嘉奖大兴、清苑两县地方武装。通令指出：（一）二月十八日蒋傅匪骑四师全部及九十二军四个团、十六军一个团共八个团兵力，对永定河北固安、安次方圆三十里地区实行合击“围剿”，大兴县地方武装当即机动撤出敌合击圈内，使敌主力扑空，次日敌跟踪追至刘家铺（固安西北三十里），该县地方武装当即还击，毙伤敌人马各三十余后，安全转移，使敌企图完全落空。创造了小部队于敌纵深粉碎敌人大兵团合击的范例。（二）二月下月，清苑地方武装于保定南大福村等地打击蒋匪军，一周内作战三次，歼敌一一七名，缴获机枪五挺，步马枪五十支，创造了集小胜为大胜的榜样。
