　　Promoting Democracy to Distinguish Good from Bad
  　Masses in Yetao Assist in Party Rectification
    [Our Dispatch] Yetao is a large village in the old liberated area of Wu'an, with 795 households and 2,549 people. When the democratic movement to rectify the Party began, the work team visited poor peasants and hired laborers and also held a branch meeting to announce the need to rectify the Party ranks and for Party members to reflect. However, this kind of reflection would not yield results; it only served as a public preparation for the ideological rectification of Party members. During the public rectification, a village-wide meeting was first convened, the list of Party members was announced, and the masses were asked to provide feedback on Party members, sending representatives to participate in branch meetings. Because Party member cadres usually have a threatening power over the masses, the masses have ideological concerns, fearing retaliation and fearing that they would not be supported to the end, just like during the "face washing and smearing black" campaigns. In this situation, it is necessary to put pressure on Party members and support the masses. After the village-wide meeting, the masses responded very well, believing that such a meeting had never been held before. Then, mass meetings were held in each street to provide feedback, with Party members not participating, so that the masses could speak freely. Representatives were elected to participate in branch meetings.
    A total of 126 representatives were elected by the masses, including 18 women. There were 60 Party members in the village. The composition of the representatives was 64 poor peasants and hired laborers, 32 new middle peasants, and 30 old middle peasants. The representatives provided feedback quite universally at the branch meetings; only a very few people did not speak at all. It was a democratic movement jointly carried out by middle peasants and poor peasants. However, because the concerns and suspicions of the masses were not completely dispelled, several people with prejudices against Party member cadres were selected as "artillerymen," wanting to use them to provide feedback. Therefore, there were still problems with the selection of representatives. On the first day of the meeting, some representatives with prejudices against Party member cadres spoke very radically, saying that a certain Party member was sent by Chiang Kai-shek, a certain Party member had connections with Old Chiang, a certain person was a member of the Tianmen Society, and a certain person was a large landlord, all without any basis. These excessive remarks could not be stopped in the meeting, only outside the meeting were poor peasant representatives convened to analyze the speeches, seeing which opinions were correct and which were not, relying on poor peasants to guide the masses in distinguishing right from wrong. The speeches of honest poor peasants were generally more accurate, and they did not agree with those excessive remarks. Through the method of combining the meeting and outside activities of poor peasants, the development of deviations was prevented. From the second day onwards, these excessive remarks disappeared, but there were still exaggerations in the feedback on corruption. Staff members must have a clear head; when the masses begin to give feedback to Party member cadres, it is inevitable that there will be problems with the election of representatives, and it is inevitable that there will be excessive remarks and exaggerations. One cannot waver in the determination to support the masses because of this. Only then will the masses dare to continue to speak and provide feedback, but one cannot sit idly by and watch the development of deviations. Taking extra-curricular activities, relying on poor peasants, and preventing deviations is also necessary.
    　　　　Supervise Party Members to Seriously Reflect　Guide the Masses to Strengthen Confidence
    After the branch meeting ended, Party members developed serious resistance. They seized on the excessive remarks of a very small number of representatives with prejudices as capital for resistance, saying that those representatives were bad, that the feedback they provided was not factual, that it could not be resolved anyway, and that they were waiting to be sent to the People's Court; or they said, "Let the masses confiscate all my family property and dispose of it as they please." At first, when these Party members reflected within the branch, they outwardly expressed their willingness to humbly accept the opinions of the masses and correct their mistakes, but this was actually a false impression. Some Party members have always stood above the masses, ordering and suppressing them, and do not have a sufficient understanding of their own mistakes. They also thought that the masses' feedback was the same as "face washing and smearing black." When the masses gave them feedback, the momentum was different, and naturally they were very resistant. However, one must not waver and relax the pressure on Party members because there are some problems in the feedback from the masses and because Party members are resistant. Otherwise, some bad Party members will take the opportunity to exploit loopholes. At this time, individual conversations were conducted among Party members, guiding Party members with less feedback from the masses to seriously reflect and conduct self-criticism, isolating those who made big mistakes and did not reflect well. For those who made big mistakes, they were also pointed out that the masses' representatives had so many correct opinions, so why not reflect according to the correct opinions, but instead specifically pick on individual opinions to resist, which is not right. At the same time, it was made clear that the eyes of the masses are sharp and will never wrong anyone. Good reflection, knowing mistakes and correcting mistakes is the way out. The masses were satisfied with this meeting. Honest poor peasants who had not spoken or asked questions for many years also spoke at the meeting. A poor peasant who had been wronged by a Party member cadre said that after he finished talking about the injustice, he had been holding his breath in his heart for many years, and today he was relieved, and he felt very happy. In addition, the masses also improved a step ideologically, feeling that giving feedback to Party member cadres should be practical, not adding fuel to the fire, dissatisfied with those "artillerymen," initially overcoming the idea of relying on "artillerymen," and gradually increasing their self-confidence. In the subsequent development of the Poor Peasants' Association, they temporarily put those "artillerymen" outside and did not let them participate; in the second participation in the branch meeting, only a few individuals were still elected as representatives.
    However, this branch meeting to rectify the Party ranks also had shortcomings: (1) Before the public rectification of the Party ranks, although there were some initiators of the Poor Peasants' Association, and twelve people were elected to lead the way, they had not yet formed an organization, and the number of people was small, causing them to still suspect that their strength was weak, and they always wanted to let the "artillerymen" who could speak well take the lead in charging forward. In addition, the deliberation before the election of representatives was not enough, and they failed to guide the masses on how to choose representatives; if these tasks had been carried out better, there might have been fewer problems with the selection of representatives, and the speeches might have been better. But one cannot demand that there be no problems at all. (2) When giving feedback to Party members, the masses asked to give feedback to Party members with more mistakes first, "hitting the tiger first to knock out its teeth." In the course of the meeting, it was felt that this was inappropriate, and it was changed to giving feedback on big and small mistakes mixed together. This is not only a technical issue, but also has educational significance for both the masses and Party members. On the first day of the meeting, giving feedback only to Party members with more mistakes caused the illusion of Party members with fewer mistakes, feeling that the masses had a lot of opinions on every Party member, and feeling dissatisfied. A Party member who had no opinions from the masses cried secretly in the venue when he saw the masses giving feedback to others. At the same time, it is also easy to be ambiguous in the thinking of the masses, feeling that all Party members are bad. Later, when big and small mistakes were mixed together, there was more feedback on bad Party members, and no feedback could be given on good Party members, which easily isolated the bad ones and made the ideological emotions of the good Party members easy to get close to the masses. On the part of the masses, it is also easy to distinguish that there are bad Party members and good Party members. The masses said that there are bad Party members and good Party members, and there are still quite a few good ones. At the beginning of the public Party, the masses also said that there are quite a few good Party members, but they always added a sentence, "We have no opinion on him, I don't know if other streets have any opinions"; after the meeting, they didn't say that anymore.

### 发扬民主分别好坏　冶陶群众协助整党

　　发扬民主分别好坏
  　冶陶群众协助整党
    【本报消息】冶陶是武安老解放区大村庄之一，全村有七百九十五户，二千五百四十九人。填补整党民主运动开始，工作组在访问贫雇同时，曾召开了支部大会，宣布要整顿党的队伍，要党员反省。但这种反省，不会有成绩，只是在党员思想上作些公开整顿的准备。公开整顿时，先召开了全村大会，公布了党员名单，要求群众给党员提意见，派代表参加支部会。因为党员干部，平素对群众有威胁力量，群众思想有所顾虑，怕报复，又怕和洗脸擦黑时一样，不给他们撑腰到底。在这种情况下，就必须给党员以压力，给群众撑腰。全村会后，群众反映很好，认为从来没有开过这样的大会。接着各街开群众会，提意见，党员不参加，以便群众能尽情的说话。并选出了代表，参加支部会议。
    群众选举的代表，共一百二十六人，内有妇女十八人。全村党员六十人。代表成份是贫雇六十四人，新中农三十二人，老中农三十人。支部会上，代表提意见的相当普遍，只有极少数人，始终未发言，是一个中贫农联合进行的民主运动。但因群众的顾虑和怀疑未能完全解除，也选了几个和党员干部有成见的人当炮手，想利用他们提意见，所以代表人选上也还有毛病。在第一天的会上，有些对党员干部怀成见的代表发言很偏激，动辄说某某党员是蒋介石派来的，某某党员和老蒋有连系，某某是天门会，某某是大地主，都是没有根据的。这些过火的发言，不能在会中予以制止，只在会外召集贫雇代表分析会上的发言，看那些意见正确，那些意见不正确，依靠贫雇诱导群众辨别是非轻重。一般老实贫雇的发言，都是比较正确，他们对那些过火的发言也不同意，经过大会与会外贫雇活动的方式，来防止偏向的发展。从第二天以后，这种过火的发言即没有了，但提贪污意见的还有夸大的现象。工作人员必须头脑清醒，群众开始向党员干部提意见时，选举代表有毛病是难免的，发言过火、夸大，也是难免的，不能因此动摇给群众撑腰的决心，群众才敢于继续发言提意见，但也不能坐视偏向的发展，采取会外活动，依靠贫雇，防止偏向，也是需要的。
    　　　　督促党员认真反省　诱导群众加强信心
    支部大会结束后，党员产生了严重的抵抗情绪，他们抓住极少数有成见代表的过火意见，作为抵抗的资本，说那些代表不好，提的意见不是事实，反正不能解决，等待着送人民法庭；或者说，叫群众把我的家产全部没收，随便处理吧。这些党员开头在支部内反省时，表面表示愿意虚心接受群众意见，改正错误，实际是一种假象。有些党员一贯站在群众之上，命令压制群众，对自己错误认识不足，对群众提意见，也以为和洗脸擦黑一样。等到群众给他们提意见时，劲头不同，自然是很抵抗的。但决不能因群众提意见中有些毛病、党员抵抗而发生动摇，放松对党员的压力。否则，一部分坏党员就趁机钻了空子。这时在党员中进行了个别谈话，诱导群众意见少的党员，认真反省，进行自我批评，孤立那些错误大反省不好的。对错误大的也给他们指出群众代表正确的意见那么多，为什么不照着正确意见反省，而专门挑剔个别意见来抵抗，是不对的？同时也明确群众的眼光是亮的，决不会冤屈一个人，好好反省，知错改错，才是出路。这个会议群众感到满意，多年不说话不问事的老实贫雇农，在会中也说了话。一个受过党员干部冤屈的贫农，他把冤屈说完后，说多年蹩在心里的气，今天算出了，心里很痛快。另外在群众思想上也提高了一步，感到给党员干部提意见要实际，不能添油加醋，对那些炮手不满意，初步克服依靠炮手的思想，逐渐增加了自信心。在以后发展贫农团的工作中，他们暂时把那些炮手放在外面，未让参加；在第二次参加支部会时，只有个别人仍被选为代表。
    不过这次整顿党的队伍的支部大会中也有毛病：（一）在公开整顿党的队伍之前，虽然有了一部分贫农团发起人，并选举了十二人带头，但是还未形成组织，人数也少，致使他们仍然怀疑自己的力量薄弱，总想让能说会道的炮手代替自己打冲锋。另外选举代表以前的酝酿不够，未能诱导群众如何选择代表；若是这些工作进行得更好些，选派代表的毛病可能更少些，发言可能更好些。但仍不能要求完全无毛病。（二）给党员提意见时，群众要求先给错误多的党员提意见，“打虎先敲牙”。在会议的进行中，感到不妥，改为错误大的小的错杂着提。这不仅是个技术问题，而是对群众对党员都有教育意义的。会议头一天，尽给错误多的党员提意见，引起错误小的错觉，觉得群众对每个党员都有很多意见，心里不满。有一个群众没啥意见的党员，看到群众给别人提意见时，自己在会场背地哭泣。同时在群众思想上也容易模糊不清，觉得凡是党员都是坏的。以后把错大错小的错杂提时，坏党员提的意见即多，好党员即提不出什么意见，这样容易使坏的孤立，使好党员的思想情绪容易靠近群众。在群众方面也容易分清党员中有坏的，也有好的。群众说，党员中有坏的也有好的，好的也还不少。在开始公开党时，群众也说过党员中好的也不少，但总要加一句我们对他没啥意见，不知别街有意见没有；大会后，他们不这样说了。
