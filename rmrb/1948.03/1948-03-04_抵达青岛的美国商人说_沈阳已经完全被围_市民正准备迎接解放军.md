Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Qingdao, 28th – An American merchant who arrived here three days ago from Shenyang admitted: "Shenyang is now in a state of complete and absolute encirclement. It is only a matter of time before the Communists (referring to the People's Liberation Army) take the city." He revealed: "The million citizens of Shenyang are all prepared to welcome the People's Liberation Army into the city and to live under a democratic government." He admitted: "Whether we (referring to the United States) spend 570 million dollars, or 570 billion dollars, the result will be the same." According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: as the PLA's iron ring tightens, the Chiang Kai-shek "central" government organs, ten provincial and municipal governments, more than ten provincial and municipal Kuomintang party headquarters, Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League headquarters, and several provincial and municipal puppet councils gathered in Shenyang are all in a state of panic. Since the PLA captured Liaoyang, Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic officials in Shenyang have been selling jewelry and valuables, while Chiang Kai-shek's Resources Committee is hurriedly chartering planes at great expense to evacuate its personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: According to Qingdao's official "Min Yan Bao" newspaper, Chiang Kai-shek's troops are once again carrying out large-scale conscription in Qingdao. On the 3rd and 4th of last month, armed Chiang Kai-shek soldiers suddenly appeared on the streets, and all young and middle-aged men among the pedestrians were grabbed onto trucks and taken to the docks. In the Changchun Road and Taiping Village areas of Dongzhen alone, more than 120 people were seized. In Qinghai Road, north of the city, twenty-four citizens, including Gao Huanchun, were seized in one go. These "conscripts" were transported to Yantai on the morning of the 5th and will all be used to replenish a certain army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Most of those captured were street coolies, vendors, and poor people; after their capture, their families lost their means of support. On the afternoon of the 6th, more than a thousand ragged men, women, old and weak gathered at Chiang Kai-shek's 11th Pacification District Headquarters to demand their husbands and sons. Chiang Kai-shek's conscription has caused panic throughout the city.

　　抵达青岛的美国商人说
  　沈阳已经完全被围
  　市民正准备迎接解放军
    【新华社陕北二日电】青岛二十八日讯：三日前离沈阳抵此的美国商人承认：“沈阳已处于完全与绝对包围之中，共军（指人民解放军）取得该城仅属时间问题了。”他透露：沈阳市百万市民皆已准备迎接人民解放军入城并在民主政权下生活。他承认：“不管我们（指美国）花五亿七千万美元，还是花五千七百亿美元，其结果都是一样的。”另据蒋区报纸消息：由于解放军之铁环越缩越小，现麇集沈阳之蒋匪“中央”政府机关，十个省、市政府，十余个省市国民党党部、三青团团部和几个省市的御用参议会等都惶惶不安。自解放军攻克辽阳以后，沈市蒋匪官僚竞卖珠宝细软，蒋匪资源委员会则急忙忙以巨金包机撤运该会人员。
    【新华社陕北二日电】据青岛匪官方民言报透露：蒋匪又在青市大肆抓丁。上月三、四两日武装蒋匪突出现于大街上，行人中凡青壮年，均被抓上卡车载赴码头。仅东镇长春路、太平村一带，被抓去者即达一百二十余人；市北青海路一次被抓去市民高焕春等二十四人。此等“壮丁”已于五日晨运往烟台，将一律补充蒋匪某军。被抓者多为街头苦力、摊贩、贫民；抓后彼等家属失去生活依靠，六日下午二时即有衣衫褴褛的男女老弱千余人，聚集蒋匪十一绥区司令部索夫索子，蒋匪抓丁已引起全市惶惶不安。
