Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. The Greek Democratic Army recently routed an enemy division in the Epirus region of central Greece, annihilating two enemy battalions and achieving an unprecedented victory. According to a communiqué issued by the Democratic Army headquarters on the 7th: The Royalist Fascist Army, after transferring two brigades and one battalion of specially selected assault troops (i.e., the 8th Division of mountain troops widely touted by the Royalist Fascist government), and supported by powerful artillery and air force, launched an offensive against the Democratic Army in northwestern Epirus starting on February 25th. After fifty-two hours of fierce fighting, the Democratic Army repulsed the enemy on all major fronts and, on the evening of March 5th, launched a vigorous counter-offensive near the city of Filiates on the right flank, crushing the resistance of the enemy's 76th Brigade and annihilating two infantry battalions. After suffering heavy casualties and material losses, the Royalist Fascist Army retreated southward. The Soviet Red Star newspaper wrote on the 7th, commenting on the Greek war situation: The Greek Democratic Army captured many villages and towns in February, including the city of Balmida, less than fifteen kilometers from Athens. "With the support of the broad masses of the people, the scale of the Democratic Army's counter-offensive is growing."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to a broadcast by the Free Greece Radio: The Democratic Army has recently launched offensives in various places, dealing a series of blows to the enemy. The Royalist Fascist Army has abandoned its positions in the Florina region in the north and in certain areas in the center in a state of disarray, suffering heavy losses. A unit of the Democratic Army, after a long march, suddenly marched into the coastal Thessalian Plain in the northeast, once capturing the two cities of Almyros and Ikinolopos.

    【新华社陕北十二日电】希腊民主军近在希中部爱匹鲁斯地区击溃敌军一个师，歼敌两个营，获得空前大捷。据民主军总部七日发表的公报：保皇法西斯军，增调特选突击队两旅一营（按即保皇法西斯政府所广泛吹嘘的山地部队第八师），并且辅以强大的炮兵和空军，于二月二十五日起，在爱匹鲁斯西北部，对民主军发动攻势。经过五十二小时恶战，民主军在各重要战线上击溃了敌军，并于三月五日晚，在右翼非里亚提斯城附近，转入有力的反攻，粉碎了敌军第七十六旅的抵抗，歼敌步兵两营。保皇法西斯军在蒙受重大伤亡与物资损失后，向南溃退。苏联红星报七日在评论希腊战事时写道：希腊民主军二月间攻克了许多村镇，包括距雅典不到十五公里的巴尔米达城，“民主军在广大人民拥护下，反攻的规模已越来越大”。
    【新华社陕北十日电】据自由希腊电台广播：民主军近日在各地发动进攻，予敌一连串打击。保皇法西斯军在北部佛洛林纳地区和在中部某些地区，狼狈放弃阵地，损失惨重。民主军一部曾经过长途行军，突然长征东北部滨海的色萨利平原，一度攻克阿尔米罗斯和伊金罗波斯两城。
