　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: New York dispatch: The heroic hunger strike of four American people's warriors – Williamson of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Smith and Dorr, labor union leaders and communists, and Eisler, a German anti-fascist writer – has won a preliminary and significant victory. According to a United Press dispatch from New York on the 7th, a division of the Federal Court has been forced to allow the aforementioned four people's warriors to be released on bail. Their doctors are now examining the effects of the six-day hunger strike on their bodies. This hunger strike by the four people's warriors has aroused widespread sympathy and support from American people. On the 5th, the American Civil Rights Congress organized more than 30 picketers to patrol the entrance of the White House, demanding the release of the four warriors. They held signs that read "We fight for human rights, and we will not stop until we reach our goal," hoping to intercept Truman, who had just returned from the Caribbean. As a result, Truman was forced to sneak into the White House through a side door, looking very embarrassed.

  　美共领袖绝食斗争胜利
    【新华社陕北九日电】纽约讯：美共中委威廉逊、美工会领袖共产党人史密斯与多尔、德籍反法西斯作家艾斯勒四位美国人民战士的英勇绝食斗争，已赢得初步重大胜利。据合众社纽约七日电说，联邦法院分院已被迫允许上述四人民战士交保出狱。他们的医生现正检查六天来绝食对他们身体的影响。这次四人民战士的绝食，曾引起了美国人士的广泛同情声援，美人权保障大会五日曾组织纠察员三十余人，巡逻于白宫门口，要求释放四位战士。他们手持“我们为人权而奋斗，不达目的不止”的标语牌，希望拦截刚自加勒比海归来的杜鲁门。结果杜氏被迫自旁门溜入白宫，状甚狼狈。
