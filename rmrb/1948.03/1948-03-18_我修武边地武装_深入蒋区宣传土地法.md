　　Our Armed Forces in the Border Areas of Xiuwu
  　Deeply Penetrate Chiang Areas to Promote the Land Law
    [Taihang News] Small armed detachments of our Xiuwu border area, combined with the promotion of the Land Law, have further inspired and organized the people's struggle against the enemy. Recently, in our in-depth promotion of the Land Law to the people in the Chiang-occupied areas, the people in the border areas showed great concern for the Land Law, asking in small groups for explanations. On the 6th of this month, Wu Gongdui (armed work team) member Liu Huaisong took some people to the Xiaozhang Village area. After arriving in the village, an old lady asked Comrade Liu about the Land Law. He immediately called three or four people over, and after Liu Huaisong explained it to them, some said: "This is different from the past. It's so good, it would be great if it were implemented here!" After listening to the Land Law, some of the people in Kong Village said: "Can't we implement it here? We've been waiting for it so long that our eyes are almost blind. Let's drive the enemy away quickly!" Under the influence of the Land Law propaganda, people imprisoned in Xiuwu City by the enemy also took the opportunity of going out of the city to chop firewood and actively sought out comrades active in the front to express their grievances and ask for the Land Law Outline. One day, dozens of people talked to us one after another. Some held dry food made of bran and flour, telling us about the enemy's crimes of demanding grain and conscripting soldiers. One person said: "Comrades, how can we live if we have nothing to eat or drink!" Some were preparing to move out, but after explaining: "Moving out is not a solution. Now we need to think of ways to fight the enemy more and strive to drive the enemy away as soon as possible so that we can divide the land and grow our own fields on our own land." Hearing this, everyone felt it made sense. They took several copies of the Land Law and propaganda materials, tied them into their firewood bundles, and went back. In addition, on the same day, the enemy from Wolonggang went to Wulipu to demand money, and the masses rose up to fight against the enemy. Some used their understanding of the Land Law to promote it to the Chiang bandit soldiers, warning them: if they continue to harm the common people, they will not be given land when the land is distributed in the future. This also had a great impact on the Chiang bandit soldiers.

　　我修武边地武装
  　深入蒋区宣传土地法
    【太行消息】我修武边地小股武装活动，结合宣传土地法，进一步鼓舞与组织了人民的对敌斗争。最近在我向蒋占区人民深入宣传土地法中，边地人民对土地法表现了非常的关切，三三两两的要求向他们作解释。本月六号武工队刘怀松带了一些人到小张庄一带活动，到村后，一个老太太便向刘同志打听土地法的事，他当下就叫了三四个人来，刘怀松向他们讲了后，有的就说：这可和过去不一样了，这么好，啥时实行到俺们这里就好啦！孔庄的老百姓在听了土地法后有的这样说：我们这就不能实行吗？俺盼的可是把眼快盼瞎啦，咱们快点把敌人打走吧！在土地法宣传的影响下，被敌人关在修武城里的人，借着出城砍柴的机会，也纷纷找着我们在前边活动的同志，进行诉苦，向我们要土地法大纲。有一天就有几十个人先后向我们接谈，有的手拿着以麸面皮作成的干粮，向我们诉说敌人要粮抓丁的罪恶，有个人这样说：“同志，我们吃喝不上怎能活下去啊！”有的就要准备往出搬家，后经说明：“搬出来也不是办法，现在就是咱们怎样想法多和敌人斗争，争取早点把敌人赶跑，咱们好分土地，在自己家种自己田”。这样一说，大家觉得也对，要了几张土地法和宣传品，捆在自己的柴捆里便回去了。另外，当天卧龙岗敌人到五里铺要款，群众便起来和敌人斗争，有的就以自己了解土地法向蒋匪士兵作宣传，警告他们：如再要害老百姓，将来分土地时就不给他们分地，这样，对蒋匪士兵也影响很大。
