　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Impose Harsh Levies on People's Food
　　Military Grain Still Lacking
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to various sources, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "grain administration" crisis is deepening. Yu Feipeng, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Minister of Food, confessed on the 7th of this month: "As of now, the average collection of actual grain collection and borrowing in the national (Chiang-controlled) area last year is 55 percent." In the previous year, it was about 70 percent. A certain Xiong, the head of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Jiangxi Land and Grain Department, also lamented: "I will become the second Chief Cheng." (Note: "Chief Cheng" refers to Cheng Maoxing, the former head of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Jiangxi Land and Grain Department. Cheng was forced to commit suicide by jumping into the river in Jishui in May of the previous year due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' limited urging for military grain). The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Hebei originally planned to extort 50 million market catties of "land tax" last year, but only 28 million market catties were actually collected by the beginning of this year. However, due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit bureaucrats' extortion and embezzlement, the people can no longer bear it. According to a disclosure in the Pingming Daily of the Fu bandit Beiping on the 1st of this month: In the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied area of ​​the province, "each mu of land only produces 140 catties of corn, while various apportionments require 130 catties."

　　蒋匪苛索民食
  　军粮还是缺乏
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据各方消息：蒋匪“粮政”危机愈益深刻。蒋匪粮食部长俞飞鹏本月七日供认：“去年度全国（蒋区）征实征借已收缴者截止目前平均为百分之五十五”。而前年度则约共收起百分之七十。江西蒋匪田粮处长熊某亦哀鸣：“我将做程处长第二了”。（按“程处长”系指前蒋匪江西田粮处长程懋型，程于前年五月间因蒋匪限催军粮，被迫在吉水跳河自杀）。河北蒋匪去年度预定“田赋”勒索额为五千万市斤，至本年初实收仅二千八百万市斤。但由于蒋匪官僚勒索浮收中饱，人民已不堪负担。据傅匪北平平明日报于本月一日披露：该省蒋占区“每亩地只打一百四十斤玉米，而各种摊派就要交到一百三十斤”。
