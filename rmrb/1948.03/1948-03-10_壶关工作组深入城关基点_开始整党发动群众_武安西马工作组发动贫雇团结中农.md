　　Huguan Work Group Goes Deep into Chengguan Base Point
  　Starts Party Rectification and Mobilizes the Masses
    Wu'an Xima Work Group Mobilizes Poor Peasants and Farm Laborers to Unite with Middle Peasants
    Openly Publicizes the Branch and Explains Policies
  　Middle Peasants and Businessmen Feel Reassured
    [Our News] After the completion of the study and reorganization of county and district cadres in most counties of Taihang, work groups have been formed and dispatched to villages to carry out land distribution, party rectification, and democratic movements. After the Huguan Chengguan base point work group started work, it first understood the situation and determined the village type and work direction. Seeing that the masses still had misunderstandings about the Land Law, the middle peasants were panicked, the landlords counterattacked, and the cadres' thinking was also confused. It immediately convened a mass meeting, where Comrade Li Sen (from the County Party Committee) of the work group gave a report to everyone, explaining the spirit of the policies, expressing the attitude of the work group to the masses, and explaining the purpose of this work, which is to first meet the requirements of the poor peasants and farm laborers, to consolidate and unite the middle peasants, and not to harm the interests of the middle peasants. It also pointed out that cadres who had taken too much fruits of the revolution must return them, and bad work styles must be reformed. Party members must also be made public, so that they can be reviewed by the masses, accept criticism and evaluation from the masses. At this point, more than 90% of the masses at the meeting requested that they be made public on the same day. At that time, the work group considered the opinions of the masses and immediately replied to everyone's request, and publicly announced the Chengguan branch on the spot. After the meeting, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high and they discussed it a lot. Poor peasant Ma Fengchong said: "This time is different from the past, we must completely turn over!" A businessman said: "I didn't understand the Land Law before, and thought that we were going to fight the middle peasants and businessmen, but now I understand." Niu Haihe, a family member of a soldier who resisted Japan in Dongjie, was given extra land, and he said after the meeting: "I want to return the extra land, and I am willing to stand with everyone." Now we are mobilizing the poor peasants and, according to the local situation, preparing to establish a poor peasants' association, and party member cadres have also begun to reflect.
    The work group organized by the Wu'an County Party Committee has arrived in Ximazhuang Village and immediately began to visit the poor peasants and farm laborers to understand the overall situation of the village. According to preliminary understanding, there are currently eight households in the village who are very poor and have not turned over well. Among them, four households lack land, and others lack houses, livestock, food, and clothing. In addition, the masses are very dissatisfied with the cadres' excessive occupation of the fruits of the revolution and lack of democracy. For example, the widow Song Guitangniang said: "When there was conflict between cadres and the masses, I had a lot of opinions, but when I saw Xiao Gui being attacked, I didn't dare to speak. If we compare ourselves with the cadres, we will be very angry. We can only compare with the past. In the past, we didn't have a room or a piece of land, but now we finally have a place to spit." Because the mobilization of poor peasants and farm laborers is not enough, they are not confident in turning over and becoming masters of the country, and say, "We can't do it, we can't speak." Now we are strengthening education to enlighten their awareness and are determined to take root in the honest poor peasants and farm laborers. Then, through them, we will mobilize the entire poor peasant class and unite the middle peasants. While mobilizing the poor peasants and farm laborers, we also began to rectify the branch cadres. They began to show resistance to the opinions of the masses. For example, the village chief sang at the crossroads: "If you don't hold high office, you won't be harmed..." etc. A new party member who is not in power reflected: "We are small insects (sparrows) following the night bats, wasting our eyes." Now we are carrying out self-criticism to enlighten them to consciously examine their mistakes. (Zhu Yaoting)

　　壶关工作组深入城关基点
  　开始整党发动群众
    武安西马工作组发动贫雇团结中农
    公开支部讲明政策
  　中农商人安下了心
    【本报消息】太行大部县份县区干部学习整编结束，已组成工作组，分头到村开展填补整党民主运动。壶关城关基点工作组开始工作后，首先了解情况，确定村庄类型和工作方针。又见群众对土地法还有误解，中农恐慌，地主反攻，干部思想也混乱。当即召开群众大会，由工作组李森同志（县委）给大家作报告，讲明政策精神，向群众表明态度，说明这次工作的目的，是要首先满足贫雇农要求，要巩固的团结中农，不损害中农利益。并指出干部多占果实必须退出，坏作风必须改造。党员也要一律公开，让他们到群众中审查，接受群众的批评鉴定，谈到这里，大会百分之九十以上的群众要求当天就公开，当时工作组考虑了群众意见，当即答复大家要求，当场将城关支部公开。会后群众情绪十分高涨，纷纷议论。贫雇马凤冲说：“这次和往常可不一样啦，可要彻底翻身哩！”做买卖的人说：“我以前不懂土地法，以为要斗中农和商人，这下可明白了。”东街抗属牛海和多分了地，会后他说：“多分的地我要退出，愿和大家站到一块。”现正发动贫雇，根据当地情况，准备成立贫农团，党员干部也开始反省。
    武安县委组织的工作组，已到西马庄村，开始即深入访问贫雇，了解全村面貌，据初步了解，村中现有八户翻身很差的窟窿户，其中有四户是缺少土地，其他有缺少房屋、牲口、衣食等。另外群众对干部的多占果实和不民主也十分不满，如寡妇宋贵堂娘说：“闹干群关系时，我有很多意见，蹩到嘴边，见小贵受打击就不敢说了。咱要和干部比，肚子就要气崩了，咱只有和过去比，过去房无一间地无一垄，现在总算有个吐唾沫的地方了。”因贫雇发动还不够，他们对翻身当家信心不高，如说“咱不行，不会说”。现正加强教育，启发其觉悟，决心把根扎在老实贫雇身上。再通过他们去发动整个贫雇层，团结中农。在发动贫雇同时也开始整顿支部干部，他们对群众意见开始表现抵抗，如村长在路口唱：“不居高官不被害……”等，不当权的新党员反映：“咱是小虫（麻雀）跟着夜蝙蝠走，瞎熬眼。”现正开展自我批评，启发他们自觉检查错误。　（朱耀庭）
