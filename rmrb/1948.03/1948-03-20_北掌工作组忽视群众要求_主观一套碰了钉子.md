　　North Zhang Working Group Neglects Mass Demands
　　Subjectivity Hits a Wall
　　[Shahe News] After the working group of the North Zhang Village in the Fourth District of Shahe arrived in the village, they did not understand the main demands of the masses. They immediately shouted "equal distribution of land," and then began to conduct household statistics of land, houses, farm tools, etc. They also secretly mobilized poor and hired peasants, resulting in panic among the middle peasants, and the poor and hired peasants did not sympathize. When the number of poor and hired peasants reached fifty, the leadership subjectively proposed to inspect the emancipation situation. Most of the masses felt uninterested. An old man said, "If I turn over too much, I will have to return the land," and left. The working group reviewed the reasons why the masses were not enthusiastic, mainly because the working policy was incorrect and they did not pay attention to the demands of the masses. After in-depth interviews, it was discovered that the village's emancipation was almost complete, and the current main demand of the masses was democracy. Also, because the working group did not express its attitude upon arriving in the village, the masses were confused, and the spring plowing was approaching, they felt that meetings during the day would delay work. After finding out the above reasons, at the request of the masses, they immediately switched to party rectification. However, at the beginning, they treated the mistakes of party members the same, regardless of their severity, which was another mistake. Several new party members, such as Cui Wengui, wanted to withdraw and quit. They didn't even go to meetings, saying, "We haven't been in for many days, even if we don't have anything, we have to reflect. Does this count as committing a crime?" At this time, party rectification encountered difficulties, and the comrades of the working group got angry and said, "You can leave if you want to leave, and join if you want to join. There is no such freedom!" This was also ineffective, so they had to change their attitude and talk to them individually. Several comrades then turned around and launched an ideological struggle within the party, making many criticisms of bad party members, becoming the leadership's reliance within the party. Originally, the village branch had long been prepared for confrontation. They had a meeting beforehand and planned what each person would reflect on, so it was difficult to open up the situation at the beginning. Preliminary experience in party rectification: 1. Rely on good party members and party members with minor errors as the backbone to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Party members who had some minor problems at the beginning were afraid to boldly criticize bad party members because they also had shortcomings and were afraid of retaliation when it was their turn, so they did not speak up. After discovering this, individual talks were immediately conducted to break through this point and resolve their ideological concerns.
　　2. Rely on the help of the masses to deepen the reflection of party members. Before the masses participated, the reflection of party members was superficial. After the mass ranks were almost rectified, representatives were elected to participate in the branch meeting, eight men and two women, a total of ten people. The first to report was the village chief, whose mistakes were relatively large. At the beginning, other party members criticized him fiercely, and the struggle was very intense. An old man said, "Even party members are being rectified so fiercely." During the day, the representatives took the initiative to publicize to the masses. This had a great impact. The representatives publicized to the masses and collected mass opinions to raise in the branch. After several representative participations, it was of great help to the party members.
　　3. It is necessary to express the leadership's attitude. At the beginning, they did not investigate the bottom line, so they did not dare to boldly expose their mistakes because they were afraid of losing face and being beaten. Some proposed: "In the past, there were many things that your leadership drew a big circle, and we drew a small circle, always pushing the blame on us, but we can't stand it." Indeed, for many mistakes made in work, our leadership must bear the responsibility. After expressing the attitude, it was proposed: "The eyes of the masses are bright, they can see the size of your mistakes, and how you reflect on them. We will never wrong you." In this way, he knew that the leadership and the masses were transforming them and treating them warmly, so that comrades who made mistakes dared to speak out.
　　4. One thing that has not been done well enough can also be said to be a shortcoming. A Tian Shu teacher was elected as a representative and participated in several branch meetings. He came out and said, "The Communist Party is the same as our (religious sect). The upper level is very good, but the lower level does bad things." He regarded the party as a secret society. In this village, the superstitious ideas of secret societies and religious sects have deeply paralyzed the masses. Some education has been carried out, but it is far from enough. In the future, the differences between the Communist Party and religious sects will be discussed publicly among the masses.

### 北掌工作组忽视群众要求　主观一套碰了钉子

　　北掌工作组忽视群众要求
  　主观一套碰了钉子
    【沙河消息】沙河四区北掌村工作组到村后，没了解群众的主要要求是什么，一开始即大叫“平分土地”，接着就先进行逐户统计地、房、农具………等，并找贫雇偷偷进行发动，结果使中农恐慌，贫雇也不同情。到贫雇发展到五十人时，领导上主观的提出检查翻身情况，多数群众感到没兴趣，有个老汉说：“我翻高了，还退地的，”便走了。工作组检讨群众不起劲原因，主要是工作方针不对，没注意群众要求。经深入访问，发现这村翻身已差不多，群众当前主要要求是民主。又因工作组到村没表明态度，群众摸不着头脑，春耕也近了，白天开会嫌误工。把以上原因找出后，在群众要求下，立即转上整党。但一开始对党员错误不分轻重一样看待，又犯了个毛病，有崔文贵等几个新党员要退出，不干了，叫开会也不去，他们说：“咱才进去没多天，没有啥也得反省，这算犯了罪？”这时，使整党遇到困难，工作组同志起了火说：“你们想出就出，想进就进，没有那么自由的事！”这样也无效，只好转变了态度，个别谈。几个同志才转过来，开展了党内思想斗争，向坏党员提意见很多，成了领导上在党内的依托力量。原来该村支部，早就有了对抗的准备，他们事先开了会，计划了每人所检讨的东西，因此开始很难打开局面。整党中的初步经验：一、依靠党内好的及错误不大的党员为骨干，开展批，评和自我批评开始稍有些毛病的党员，不敢大胆的向坏党员提，原因是自己也有缺点，怕轮到自己头上报复，所以不吭气，发现后马上进行了个别谈话，突破这点，解决他的思想顾虑。
    二、依靠群众力量的帮助，使党员反省深入。群众没参加前，党员的反省是皮毛的，群众队伍整顿差不多了，推选出代表，参加支部会，男八女二共十人，头一个报告的是村长，他的错误较大，开始别的党员给他提意见很凶，斗争很激烈，有一老汉说：“光党员也是整的这样凶呀。”到白天，代表们便纷纷自动的向群众进行宣传，这个影响很大，代表们一面向群众宣传，一面收集群众意见到支部中提，经几次代表参加，对党员的帮助很大。
    三、要表明领导态度。开始他们不摸底，便不敢大胆暴露自己错误，原因是怕丢面子、怕被打，有的提：“过去有很多事，是你们领导上划个大圈子，我们划个小圈子，老把错推在俺身上，可顶不动呀。”确有好多在工作上犯的错，我们领导上是要负担当责的，表明态度后提出：“群众眼睛亮，看你错大小，反省如何，决不会屈你们。”这样，他知道领导上与群众是改造他们的，是热情相待的，使犯错误的同志，敢于说出。
    四、有一点做的还不够，也可以说是个缺点，有一个天书教头被选为代表，参加了几次支部会，出来说：“共产党和咱这（教门）也一样，上边很好，都叫下级做坏了。”把党看成一个会门。这村会门、教门迷信思想麻痹群众很深，曾进行过些教育，但很不够，今后将在群众中，公开讨论共产党与教门的区别。
