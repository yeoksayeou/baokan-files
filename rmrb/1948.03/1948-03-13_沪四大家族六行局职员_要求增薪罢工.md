Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Shanghai report: Under the heavy pressure of high rice prices of over 3.6 million yuan per dan, even the employees of the Chiang bandit's "Central Bank of China," "Bank of China," "Bank of Communications," and "Farmers Bank of China" – the four banks with traditionally better treatment – and the "Central Trust Bureau" and "Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau" – the six financial institutions – have found it impossible to live and have begun a sit-down strike on the 8th to demand a pay raise. They have all remained in their offices but have ceased all work. The Nanjing Chiang bandit authorities threatened them to resume work, but the employees resolutely declared that they refused to leave their offices until a "living wage" subsidy was granted. In other news: Shanghai's sanitation workers, due to high prices and incomes insufficient to maintain a living, jointly submitted a "resignation" request to the Chiang bandit municipal government on the 6th. If wages are not increased, a large-scale strike is bound to erupt.

　　沪四大家族六行局职员
  　要求增薪罢工
    【新华社陕北十日电】沪讯：在大米每担三百六十余万元之高物价重压下，即一向待遇较优之蒋匪“中、中、交、农”四行，及“中央信托局”、“邮政储金汇业局”六金融机关全体职员，亦已感无法生活而于八日起，为要求增薪举行静坐罢工。他们都留在办公室，但停止一切工作。南京蒋匪当局曾威吓他们恢复工作，但职员们坚决宣称：他们拒绝离开办公室，直至答应给予“生活工资”的津贴为止。另息：沪市清道夫因物价高涨，收入不能维持生活，已于六日联合向蒋匪市政府提出“辞工”要求，如工资不予提高，势将爆发大规模罢工。
