Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters recently issued its 27th operational communique, announcing the statistical results of the winter offensive battles in February. It stated that since the launch of the winter offensive, following the elimination of over 58,000 enemy troops and the recovery of ten county towns in one and a half months (from December 15th to the end of January), our field corps continued to eliminate three entire enemy divisions and one entire regiment in continuous operations in February. Together with other scattered enemy units annihilated, a total of over 46,000 enemy troops were eliminated. Furthermore, one enemy division was successfully persuaded to stage a glorious uprising. The cities of Liaoyang, Anshan, Faku, and Yingkou, as well as the important stronghold of Xinkaiyuan, were recovered. Currently, our army has recovered the entire southern Liaoning area from the outskirts of Shenyang to Yingkou, and has eliminated Faku and Xinkaiyuan, important satellite strongholds northwest to northeast of Shenyang, further isolating the enemy's precarious nest in Shenyang. The enemy, during our various campaigns, watched as their entire divisions and regiments were annihilated, not daring to send a single soldier to aid them, only foolishly gathering in the suburbs of Shenyang, shrinking back from battle. Under these circumstances, the uprising of the 58th Provisional Division in Yingkou still occurred. In order to suppress the unstable emotions within its ranks, the enemy used miscellaneous army generals as "scapegoats," and executed Qiao Wenli, the commander of the 79th Division, who was defeated in southern Shenyang. Our field corps, in the various battles of fortified positions, have continuously improved their tactics and techniques. The so-called "Iron Liaoyang" and "Steel Anshan," two important towns, were completely captured in less than a day, with entire enemy divisions annihilated and none escaping. Currently, our army is expanding its victories by taking advantage of the situation.

The preliminary statistics for February are as follows: (1) 46,318 enemy troops were eliminated, including 11,219 enemy regular army soldiers killed, 34,446 captured alive, 231 enemy local army soldiers killed or wounded, and 422 captured alive (excluding the 58th Provisional Division who revolted). The enemy regular army divisions completely annihilated include: the 54th Provisional Division of the New 5th Army, the 25th Division of the 52nd Army, and the 62nd Provisional Division of the New 6th Army. The entire regiments annihilated include: the 1st Regiment of the 30th Provisional Division of the 53rd Army, the Transportation Regiment of the 52nd Army, the Liaoyang Traffic Police Headquarters, and the Yingkou Traffic Police Headquarters. A total of six enemy officers above the rank of division commander were captured, including: Zheng Mingxin, Deputy Commander of the 52nd Army; Ma Che, Commander of the 54th Provisional Division (who escaped after being captured); Cao Jimin, Deputy Commander; Yang Futao, Chief of Staff; Hu Jinsheng, Commander of the 25th Division; and Luo Yuheng, Deputy Commander. A total of 103 enemy regular army and local army officers above the rank of major were captured, and four enemy officers above the rank of major were killed or wounded. (2) Four county towns were recovered, including: Liaoyang, Anshan, Faku, and Yingkou, as well as many important towns such as Xinkaiyuan, Zhonggu, and Shantoubao. (3) Seized: 308 artillery pieces of various types, including: 9 howitzers, 6 heavy cannons, 3 mountain guns, 5 rapid-fire guns, 19 rocket launchers, 6 heavy mortars, 61 mortars, 193 60mm mortars, and 6 infantry guns.
