　　Huguan Fourth District Focuses on Production
  　Most Villages Have Finished Delivering Manure
    [Huguan News] In the Huguan Fourth District, all villages summarized production, distributed dividends, settled accounts, and set a manure delivery plan before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month around the 27th and 28th of the twelfth lunar month last year. Currently, most villages in the district have completed the fertilizer delivery work. For example, the entire village of Shipo planned to complete fertilizer delivery by the tenth day of the new year. Li Tianxiao of the fourth team, fearing that there would be too much fertilizer and it wouldn't be delivered in time, started delivering on the first day. The third team delivered until the eighth day, and seeing that there was still a lot of fertilizer left, they mobilized everyone to deliver it overnight. The whole village delivered a total of 9,000 loads of fertilizer at night, with seven women including Nian Ying participating. Thus, the entire village of 46,000 loads of fertilizer was completed by the tenth day. A summary was conducted on the eleventh day, and 27 male and female models were selected. After the summary, everyone proposed to immediately start drawing land lots for allocation, as "Rain Water" (a solar term) was only three or four days away, and they should seize the time to get coal and prepare early. On the twelfth day, the political director and village chief led 11 ox carts, 32 donkeys, and 32 laborers to transport coal. Before the tenth day, Guojiatuo delivered 55,900 loads of fertilizer to the fields and transported back 3,300 catties of coal. Before the tenth day, Xihe Village delivered all 19,000 loads of fertilizer to the fields. Dujiawan organized two night fertilizer delivery teams, delivering 330 loads of manure at night. Longweitou also delivered 32,800 loads of fertilizer from the whole village by the tenth day and carried back 5,200 catties of coal. Fifteen villages including Daping Shang have all completed fertilizer delivery. On the fourth day of the first lunar month, poor and hired peasants from Jiaojiaodi held a meeting in the sub-district and returned to their villages. On the fifth day, they convened a meeting of team leaders to inspect fertilizer delivery. The whole village had a total of 24,000 loads of manure, but only 280 loads had been delivered, less than one-fifth. They immediately took the lead in delivering manure. Poor peasant and retired soldier Huai Shuangyao said: We must seize the time to deliver manure and prepare to implement the Land Law Outline. The Land Law is for us poor and hired peasants. If we don't take the lead, who will? He also explained the New Masses' policy toward middle peasants in detail. The enthusiasm for production among the villagers was very high, and by the fourteenth day, all the manure had been delivered.
