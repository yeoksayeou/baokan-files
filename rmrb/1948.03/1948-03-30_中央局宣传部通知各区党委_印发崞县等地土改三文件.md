　　Central Bureau Propaganda Department Notifies All District Party Committees
　　Distribute Three Land Reform Documents from Guoxian and Other Places
    [From Our Newspaper] The Central Bureau Propaganda Department issued a notice to the Propaganda Departments of all District Party Committees on March 26 stating: Based on Chairman Mao's instructions on the land reform movement in Guoxian, Shanxi, all District Party Committees should compile and print the three documents, "How Guoxian, Shanxi Carried Out Land Reform," "Typical Experience of Supplementary Allocation in Huangjiachuan, Suide," and "Land Reform Experience in the Old Liberated Area of Pingshan," into booklets and distribute them to every village work cadre. This is to enable cadres to combine them with their actual work, conduct land reform studies, disseminate experience, and improve their work. It is hoped that any new insights and experiences gained during the study and work will be promptly reported to us.
