　　The Falsifiers of History
    Soviet Intelligence Bureau
  　Part Four: The establishment of the "Eastern" Front, the German attack on the Soviet Union, the Anti-Hitler Coalition, and mutual obligations between the Allies.
    When the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was signed in August 1939, the Soviet Union never doubted that Hitler would attack the Soviet Union sooner or later. Therefore, the Soviet Union's first task was to establish an "Eastern" Front. To prepare for Hitler's aggression, it was necessary to reunite Western Belarus and Western Ukraine, which Poland had seized in 1920, with Soviet Belarus and Ukraine. On September 17, 1939, Soviet troops were ordered to occupy the above-mentioned two regions and establish fortifications along the western border. A few days later, the Soviet Union signed mutual assistance treaties with the three Baltic countries, establishing airfields and bases there, thus laying the foundation for the "Eastern" Front. Although the establishment of the "Eastern" Front was beneficial to peace-loving countries fighting against Germany, the response of the three countries, Britain, France, and the United States, was to launch a vicious anti-Soviet movement.
    While the security situation on the Soviet Union's western border was somewhat satisfactory, the situation in the north was not. The rulers of Finland, in league with the Hitlerite bandits, wanted to turn Finland into a springboard for Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. All Soviet efforts to improve relations between the two countries were in vain. Finland rejected the Soviet proposal to move the border of the Karelian Isthmus (which was only 32 kilometers from Leningrad) dozens of kilometers back, and the Soviet Union was willing to compensate it with twice the area. Finland, with its various provocations and hostile acts, launched a war against the Soviet Union. The outcome of the Soviet-Finnish War is well known: Hitler's Germany and its Finnish accomplices had to launch an offensive against the Soviet Union from a line about 150 kilometers northwest of Leningrad. It must be pointed out that although Finland stood entirely on the side of Germany, the rulers of Britain and France, through the League of Nations, declared the Soviet Union an "aggressor," openly "expelled" the Soviet Union from the League of Nations, and provided various forms of assistance to the Finnish militarists. At the same time, while Britain and France were at peace on the battlefield against Hitler's Germany, the rulers of Britain and France were diligently preparing plans to attack the Soviet Union, preparing to send "expeditionary forces" from the north and south to attack Leningrad and the Caucasus, and bomb Baku and Batumi. But the reactionaries' plans went bankrupt, and the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty was finally signed on March 12, 1940.
    But this did not mean that the "Eastern" defense line from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea had been completed. Only after Soviet troops entered Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in mid-June, and after Soviet troops entered Northern Bukovina and Moldova on June 27, was an "Eastern" defense line against the Hitlerite bandits completed. The historical falsifiers and the likes of Bevin and Bidault are clamoring that the establishment of the "Eastern" defense line was an act of "aggression," which shows that they are enemies of democracy and the people. Because if this defense line were not along Vyborg, Kaunas, Brest, and Rivne, but along Leningrad, Narva, Minsk, and Kiev, what would have been the result? That would have allowed Hitler's army to gain hundreds of kilometers of space, accelerate their advance inland, capture Moscow and Leningrad, force the Soviet Union to adopt a defensive posture for a long time, and allow Germany to withdraw fifty divisions to land in Britain. At that time, the British government might have fled to Canada. Egypt and Suez would also have fallen into Hitler's clutches. The Soviet Union would have had to withdraw troops from the Manchurian border, allowing Japan to withdraw thirty divisions to fight against China and Southeast Asia. As a result, the war would have been prolonged by at least two years.
    On June 22, 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Various people in Europe and the United States adopted various attitudes towards this event. The day after Germany attacked the Soviet Union, then-US Senator and current President Truman said, "If Germany wins, we will help the Soviet Union, and if the Soviet Union wins, we will help Germany, in order to let them kill each other as much as possible." British Minister of Aircraft Production Brabazon also made the same statement. There is no doubt that these statements represent the attitude of the reactionary elements in Britain and the United States. But the vast majority of the British and American people sympathized with the Soviet Union. On June 22, British Prime Minister Churchill said, "The danger to the Soviet Union is our danger. The cause for which the Soviet people are fighting for their homeland is also the cause of the free people of the world." Churchill's words reflected the above-mentioned sentiments. The Roosevelt government in the United States also adopted the same attitude towards the Soviet Union, thus laying the foundation for the tripartite alliance against Hitler's Germany. Everyone worked together to carry out the anti-Hitler liberation struggle. Naturally, there were certain differences between the Allies during the war. Everyone knows how important the differences over the opening of a second front were.
    The falsifiers of history attempt to prove that the Soviet Union was not and could not be a loyal ally, but because they cannot find excuses in the Soviet Union's anti-German war, they turn to the pre-war period, saying that when the Soviet Union and Germany held Berlin "negotiations" in 1940, the Soviet representatives' attitude was not that of an ally, saying that the two countries discussed and reached a consensus on "dangerous plans to divide Europe." But the fact is that the so-called Berlin "negotiations" were, at best, just Molotov's return visit to Ribbentrop's two visits to Moscow. In the talks, Hitler proposed that the Soviet Union must occupy Iran, etc., and the Soviet side only used this talk to probe Germany's attitude. The Soviet Union drew some useful conclusions from this conversation, namely that Hitler did not want to establish contact with Britain, that the Soviet Union could regard Britain as an ally against Germany, and that Yugoslavia was the only Balkan country that could be regarded as an ally against Hitler. Because of these conclusions, the Soviet government, despite the German Foreign Minister's repeated proposals, never held further negotiations with Germany. Is it not permissible for peace-loving countries to probe the attitude of the enemy? Naturally, such probing should be made known to the allies, but the Soviet Union had no allies at the time, and unfortunately there was no one to share the results of the probing with the Soviet Union.
    It must be pointed out that after the tripartite alliance was formed during the war, Britain and the United States also probed the attitude of Hitler's Germany. Documents seized by the Soviet army show that in the autumn of 1941 and in 1942 and 1943, British and German and American and German representatives, without the knowledge of the Soviet Union, negotiated the issue of reconciliation with Germany in Lisbon and Sweden. For example, in February 1943, US representative Allen Dulles (brother of John Foster Dulles) secretly negotiated with German representative Prince Hohenlohe under the pseudonym "Bull." Dulles argued that "Poland must be allowed to expand eastward to establish an anti-Bolshevik cordon sanitaire" and "completely recognize Germany's demand for leadership in Europe." It must be explained that these actions of Britain and the United States were not notified to their ally, the Soviet Union, either before or after the fact. This is a violation of the obligations between allies. The falsifiers of history certainly dare not mention these facts, because they fear the facts like the plague.
    As for the differences over the second front, they reflect different views between the Allies on their obligations. The Soviet Union believed that an ally in distress should be helped with all its strength, while Britain and the United States believed that the weaker the ally, the better. According to the Anglo-Soviet Communiqué and the US-Soviet Communiqué of 1942, Britain and the United States had an obligation to open a second front as early as 1942. However, this promise was not fulfilled until 1943. This was not accidental. Based on their selfish motives, they only wanted to harm Germany so that it could not become a dangerous competitor, and not to liberate Germany and other countries from fascist oppression. They believed that as a result of the war of attrition, the Soviet Union would lose its importance as a great power for a long time.
    The Soviet Union's policy towards its allies was fundamentally opposed to this policy. It always faithfully adhered to its obligations selflessly and impartially. Everyone remembers that at the end of December 1944, the German army launched an offensive in the Ardennes in the Western Front. At that time, the situation of the British and American armies was critical. Therefore, on January 6, 1945, Churchill telegraphed Stalin, requesting the Soviet army to launch an offensive on the Vistula River front in January to rescue the British and American armies from their predicament. Stalin replied to Churchill on the 7th, saying that although the weather was unfavorable, the Soviet Supreme Command had decided to launch a major offensive in the first half of January in advance to do its best to assist the Allied forces on the Western Front. Churchill replied to Stalin on the 9th, saying, "I am deeply grateful for your exciting telegram." In order to speed up the assistance to the Allied forces on the Western Front, the Soviet General Staff decided to advance the date of the offensive from January 20 to January 12, dispatching 150 divisions and breaking through the German defense line on a broad front. The German Fifth and Sixth Panzer Armies hurriedly transferred from the Western Front to the Eastern Front, and the German offensive on the Western Front was defeated.
    This is how Stalin did things. This is the action of a true ally. These are all facts. Historical falsifiers and slanderers do not respect the facts at all. They like to talk nonsense and scold, but these gentlemen will eventually admit a well-known truth: that nonsense and scolding will die out, while the facts will last forever. (The End)

　　历史的伪造者
    苏联情报局
  　第四部分：“东方”阵线的建立、德国进攻苏联、反希特勒同盟、同盟国间的相互义务。
    在三九年八月苏德缔结互不侵犯协定的时候，苏联片刻也未怀疑过希特勒迟早是会进攻苏联的。因此苏联的第一件任务，就在于建立“东方”阵线，以后对希特勒的侵略，为此必须把波兰在一九二○年夺去的西白俄罗斯及西乌克兰，与苏联的白俄罗斯及乌克兰重新联合起来。三九年九月十七日，苏军奉命占领上述两区，并沿西部疆界建立防御工事。几天后，苏联又与波罗的海三国签订了互助公约，在那里建立机场与基地，这样就奠定了“东方”阵线的基础。“东方”阵线的建立，虽然有利于对德作战的爱好和平各国，但英法美三国的回答，却是发动匈恶的反苏运动。
    当苏联西部边界的安全形势多少令人满意时，北部形势则不然。芬兰的统治者结合希特勒匪徒，要将芬兰变成德国攻苏的跳板。苏联改善两国邦交的一切努力，俱告无效。芬兰拒绝了苏联的建议，即将卡累利亚地峡的边界（它离列宁格勒只三十二公里）后移数十公里，而苏联愿以二倍的地区赔偿给它。芬兰以它各种的挑衅和敌对行为，发动了对苏战争。苏芬战争的结果是尽人皆知的，希特勒德国及其芬兰帮凶必须从列城西北约一百五十公里的一线，发动对苏的攻势。必须指出：虽然芬兰完全站在德国方面，但英法两国统治者却经由国联宣布苏联是“侵略者”，公然将苏联“逐出”国联，并予芬兰军国主义者以各种援助。与此同时，当英法两国在与希特勒德国作战的战场上平静无事时，英法统治者竟孜孜不倦地赶制进攻苏联的计划，准备派“远征军”从北部与南部，进攻列宁格勒与高加索，轰炸巴库与巴统。但反动派的计划是破产了，苏芬和约终于四○年三月十二日签字。
    但这并不是说，从波罗的海至黑海的“东方”防线，已经完成。只有在六月中旬苏军开入爱、拉、立，及六月二十七日苏军开入北布科维纳与摩尔达维亚之后，一条反希特勒匪帮的“东方”防线，才告完成。历史伪造者及贝文、比道尔之流，又在叫嚣建立“东方”防线是“侵略”行为，这说明他们乃是民主与人民的敌人。因为如果这条防线不是沿着维堡、考那斯、布莱斯特、罗夫，而是沿着列宁格勒、那瓦、明斯克至基辅，那会有什么结果呢？那将使希特勒军队赢得数百公里的空间，加速他们向内地推进，攻占莫斯科、列宁格勒，迫使苏联长期采取守势，而让德国能抽五十个师去登陆英伦。那时英国政府可能流亡至加拿大。埃及与苏彝士也将陷入希特勒的魔掌。苏联将不得不自满洲边境抽调军队，从而使日本能抽出三十个师团去反对中国与东南亚。由此，战争至少会延长两年多。
    四一年六月二十二日，德国进攻苏联。欧美各种不同人士对这个事件采取各种不同的态度。在德国攻苏的第二天，当时美国参议员现任总统的杜鲁门曾说：“如果德国打胜，我们就帮助苏联，如果苏联打胜，我们就帮助德国，以此办法来让他们尽量互相残杀。”英国飞机生产大臣布拉巴松也发表同样的声明。毫无疑问，这些声明是代表英美反动分子的态度的。但绝大多数的英美人民是同情苏联的。六月二十二日英首相邱吉尔曾说：“苏联的危险就是我们的危险。苏联人为其家乡而战的事业，也就是世界自由人民的事业。”邱吉尔的话是反映上述情绪的。美国罗斯福政府对苏联也采取了同样态度，因此奠定了三强联合反希特勒德国的基础。大家群策群力进行反希特勒主义的解放斗争。自然，盟国间战时也有某些分歧。大家知道关于开辟第二战场的分歧曾有着何等重大的意义。
    历史的伪造者们企图证明苏联不是而且不能是一个忠诚的盟友，但因为在苏联反德战争的行为中找不到借口，他们就转向战前，说什么一九四○年苏联与德国举行柏林“谈判”时，苏代表的态度不象盟国应有的行为，说什么两国对“分裂欧洲的危险计划”，皆予讨论，并取得了一致意见。但事实是，所谓柏林“谈判”，充其量不过是莫洛托夫对里宾特洛甫二次访问莫斯科的回拜而已。在谈话中，希特勒提出苏联必须占领伊朗等等，苏联方面只是以这次谈话来试探德国的态度。苏联从这次谈话中得出若干有益的结论，即希特勒不想和英国建立联系，苏联可以英国为反德的同盟国，南斯拉夫则是唯一可作为反希特勒盟国的巴尔干国家。苏联政府由于得出这些结论，就不顾德外长的数次提出，始终未与德国再开谈判。难道爱好和平国家试探敌人的态度，是不可容许的吗？自然，这种试探应使盟国知悉，可是苏联当时没有盟国，很不幸的没有人来和苏联共享试探的结果。
    必须指出：在战时三强联合已经形成之后，英美也曾试探过希特勒德国的态度。从苏军缴获的文件可以看出，在一九四一年秋及四二年与四三年，英德与美德的代表，都曾瞒着苏联，在里斯本与瑞典谈判对德媾和问题。例如四三年二月，美代表亚伦·杜勒斯（约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯的兄弟）曾化名“布尔”与德代表霍亨罗亲王秘密谈判，杜勒斯主张“必须让波兰向东扩张，来建立反布尔什维克的隔绝地带”与“完全承认德国在欧洲领导地位的要求”。必须说明，英美这些行动事先事后均未通知他的盟国苏联。这是违反盟国间义务的行为。历史伪造者们当然不敢提这些事实，因为他们怕事实象怕瘟疫一样。
    至于有关第二战场的分歧，那是反映了同盟国间对其义务存在不同的见解。苏联认为，一个盟友处于困境，就应竭力援助，而英美则认为，盟友愈削弱愈好。英美两国根据四二年英苏公报与美苏公报，早在四二年便有开辟第二战场的义务。然而这一诺言，延至四三年都未实行。这不是偶然的。他们本着自私的目的，只想伤害德国，使其不能成为危险的竞争者，而不是想把德国及其他国家从法西斯压榨下解放出来。他们以为苏联由于消耗战争的结果，将长期丧失作为强国的重要性。
    与这种政策根本相反的，是苏联对盟国的政策。它始终大公无私地忠实恪守它的义务。大家记得，四四年十二月底，德军在西线亚登发动攻势。当时英美军队情势危急。于是，邱吉尔于四五年一月六日致电斯大林，要求苏军于一月在维斯杜拉河前线发动攻势，解救英美军队的危局。斯大林七日答复邱吉尔，大意是虽然气候不利，苏军最高统帅部已决定提前于一月上半月发动大攻势，以尽力协助西线盟军。邱吉尔九日回电给斯大林说：“接获你令人兴奋的来电，至为感激”。苏军统帅部为了加速援助西线盟军，决定将攻势日期由一月二十日提早到十二日，出动兵力一百五十个师，并在广大阵线上突破德军防线，德军第五第六装甲军慌忙从西线调至东线，德军在西线的攻势遂被挫败。
    斯大林就是这样办事的。这是真正盟友的作为。这些都是事实。历史伪造者与诽谤者根本不尊重事实。他们喜欢空谈漫骂，然而这些先生们终将承认一个众所周知的真理：即空谈与漫骂要死灭，而事实则将永垂。（完）
