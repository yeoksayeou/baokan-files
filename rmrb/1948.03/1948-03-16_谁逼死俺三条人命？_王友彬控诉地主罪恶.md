　　Who Forced My Three Family Members to Their Deaths?
　　——Wang Youbin Accuses Landlords of Their Crimes

　　My name is Wang Youbin, and I live in Yinjiao Village, Yushe. From my grandfather's generation, we suffered our entire lives, working as long-term laborers. My grandmother begged for food her entire life. At that time, my family didn't own a single plot of land, relying solely on my grandfather's earnings from working as a long-term laborer to support my father.

　　When my father was ten years old, he herded sheep for the landlord Wang Fucai in our village. He ate two meals a day, thin vegetable porridge in the morning, and bran cornbread at noon. Every time he came back from herding sheep, he ate cold leftovers. The landlord would first ask if the sheep were full. Seeing that the sheep's bellies weren't big enough, he would get angry and tell him to go back to herding immediately, not even allowing him a moment's rest. By the time he was sixteen, he had endured all kinds of hardships! He was only provided food, without earning any money. At this time, my father pleaded with the landlord, saying he would exert all his strength as a long-term laborer to earn some money. The landlord said my father couldn't do the work of a full person. After repeated pleading, he reluctantly agreed to hire him as a long-term laborer, but with a condition: if his work couldn't match that of a full person, his wages would be deducted. My father was afraid of having his wages deducted, so he desperately endured the hardships. All year round, he ate only bran buns, becoming so thin he didn't look human. Where would he get the strength to work? The landlord saw that my father wasn't putting enough effort into his work. The wages he earned after enduring a year of suffering were all deducted. The landlord even scolded my father for being lazy and not working hard, and dismissed him.

　　Since there was no time at home, I rented over ten mu of poor land. After paying the rent each year, the remaining grain mixed with bran and vegetables was only enough to eat for four months. For the other seven or eight months, my mother begged for food. My father diligently gathered firewood while working as a long-term laborer, and also tended to the rented land at home. We lived like this for over ten years. Later, my father thought that continuing like this would never bring any prosperity. To earn a few extra coins, he worked as a long-term laborer for Wu Sanlang in Nihe Zhang Village, about three li away from our village, while also tending to the land at home. He would go to the landlord's house to work before dawn and return home in the pitch black. One autumn evening, it was dark and raining. My father accidentally fell into a ditch while walking, breaking his leg. After he came to, he crawled home in the dark. The next day, the landlord came looking for my father. I said, "He fell into a ditch last night and broke his leg! He needs to rest for a couple of days before he can go back to work." He said, "Why didn't he fall before? He falls now, when we're busy! No! If he rests for two days, his wages will be deducted." My mother said, "He didn't break his leg on purpose. Can't he make up for the lost days later?" After begging and pleading, he reluctantly agreed. My father could barely move after six or seven days, but he was afraid of losing more work, so he went to work before his leg had fully healed. Alas! It was truly a time of great misfortune. During wheat season, my father was chopping wheat stalks for the landlord in the field. The landlord insisted that my father finish chopping a large pile in one afternoon, or he wouldn't be allowed to eat. It's hard to be poor. To feed his family, my father hurriedly chopped with all his might. Unexpectedly, he accidentally chopped his own leg, severing a tendon. He used his belt to tie it up himself. My father gritted his teeth and crawled to the landlord's house, his leg covered in blood! The landlord said, "You're just bringing trouble to me. You broke your leg during the busy autumn season! You chopped your leg during the busy wheat season! You're eating my food, earning my wages, and I'm hiring you to work, not to cause me trouble! Who told you to chop your leg? I can't find anyone else to work right now. You're born with a poor fate and deserve to suffer!" He also said, "Like a melon with a pancake, suffering injustice on both sides. Go back home and rest! I can't keep you here." Then he calculated his wages and gave him five strings of cash. He didn't even offer him a meal before kicking my father out the door! At that time, I found someone to push my father home in a small cart. My mother hugged my father's leg and cried bitterly. It took ten months for his leg to heal, and he became a cripple. Then, when renting land from the landlord, he saw that my father couldn't work and was afraid we wouldn't be able to pay the rent. He didn't want us to plant it anymore. After saying many good things, he finally allowed us to keep three mu. My family ate bran and vegetables, barely surviving. By spring, we didn't even have bran and vegetables to eat, so we sold my sister (thirteen years old) for nine strings of cash to the landlord Wang Shouheng in Shankou Village. When I bring up the crimes my sister suffered, I am truly at a loss for words. About half a year after she was sold, my mother and I were worried, so we went to see her. When we saw her, she was skin and bones, barely human. She was only given thin vegetable soup to drink every day, and she had to spin six liang of cotton. If she didn't spin enough, she would be beaten and scolded, and not even allowed to eat bran and vegetables. She would be forced to drink dishwater. When she was too hungry, she would secretly eat chicken feed and pig feed. Even when the landlord saw this, she would beat her even harder. My sister never slept on the kang, but was made to sleep on the ground, with a piece of broken mat underneath and a broken blanket and straw on top. When my mother and I saw her suffering like this, we cried and went back! On the way back, my mother and I thought about taking my sister back, but we knew that if we went home, we would starve to death. So we let her suffer with the cruel landlord! Two months later, I was worried and went to see her again with my mother. Her suffering was even greater. It turned out that my sister had stolen a bun, and this caused a great disaster. Immediately, they sewed my sister's mouth shut with needle and thread, and cut off two of her toes with scissors (one on each foot). Her mother-in-law then cut my sister all over her body with scissors, cutting her into bloody pieces! As if that wasn't enough, they pierced my sister's hands with a awl, threading the palms with string. My sister couldn't bear it and died two or three times. My mother and I cried loudly when we saw my sister. Afraid of deafening her ears, the landlord desperately pushed us out, saying, "She steals food and brings shame to my family. It's okay to beat her to death." At that time, I didn't dare to say anything, thinking about suing the landlord, but she was the village chief, rich and powerful. We didn't even have food to eat, how could we file a lawsuit? My sister suffered in her home for two years before she died tragically at her hands! When my father heard this, he fell from a cliff into a mountain ditch out of anger and hunger and died! I can never forget this enormous hatred…

　　When my older brother was thirteen, he herded sheep for a landlord. When he developed a sore on his body, the landlord didn't care and simply pushed him out the door! After returning home, we had no food, and couldn't afford to hire a doctor to see him. He cried out in hunger and pain all day long. After half a year of suffering, he died of hunger and pain.

　　I started herding cattle for a landlord when I was nine years old, and endured all kinds of hardships until I was seventeen. After I went to the factory in 1940, I received exceptional warmth. I can't express how much the co-workers and leaders loved me. This is my home. I am determined to do my revolutionary work well, to avenge my father, brother, and sister.

　　谁逼死俺三条人命？
    ——王友彬控诉地主罪恶
    俺叫王友彬，家住在榆社银郊村，从俺爷爷起就受了一辈子苦，当了一辈子长工，俺奶奶要了一辈子饭，那时俺家地无一垄，光靠俺爷爷住长工挣几吊钱养活着俺爹。
    俺爹十岁时就在本村地主王富才家放羊，一天吃两顿饭，早起喝菜饭，上午吃糠窝窝头，每逢放羊回来，都是吃冷饭，地主先问问羊吃饱了没有。看见羊肚子不大，就发脾气叫马上去放，一会也不能打顿。放到十六岁上，什么苦都受啦！光管吃，不挣钱，这时俺爹和地主央求了很多好话，说给伢出尽苦力当个长工，挣几吊钱。地主说俺爹一人不能顶一个人用，又再三的央求，才勉强当个长工，伢还给订个条件，如做活不能顶住一个人的话，得扣工钱。俺爹怕扣了工钱，死来活去的拼命受着，一年四季光吃糠馍，瘦的不象人样，从哪里来的劲干活呢？地主看着俺爹干活不掏力啦，受了一年的苦罪挣的工钱都被扣光了，还骂俺爹滑头不出力干，把俺爹推出来不用啦。
    家里没时光，俺租了十几亩赖地，每年除交租子外剩下的粮食掺着糠菜仅能够吃四个月，这七八个月俺娘都是要着吃，俺爹勤劳拾柴连住长工，连捎带种家里租的地，这样的时光过了十几年。后来俺爹想，光这样下去一年到头没时光，为了挣几吊钱，又给泥河掌村吴三郎住长工，离俺村三里地，还捎带种家里的地，天不明就去老财家种地，黑洞洞才回来。那年秋天有一次天黑了还下着小雨，俺爹走着路一不小心跌在山沟里了，摔的昏过去啦，把腿也跌坏了，醒过来后，黑洞洞的天，自己爬到了家。到了白天，地主就找俺爹，俺说：“夜里跌在山沟里摔着腿啦！养一两天再去干活。”伢说：“平时你不跌，忙时你跌着腿啦！不行！养两天得扣您的工钱。”俺娘说：“俺也不是故意跌着腿，好后再给您补两天工不行吗？”哀告了很多好话才勉强许可了。俺爹六七天才会动弹，怕多误工，腿还没好就去了。唉！说起来真是多灾多难。在麦天时俺爹一个给伢地主在地里铡麦秸秆，地主非叫俺爹一晌把一大堆铡完不行，铡不完不叫吃饭；穷人难当，为了糊嘴，俺爹慌慌张张的用力铡，怎知不小心，铡到自己腿上了，把筋也铡断了一根，自己用了一条捆腰带扎住了，俺爹咬着牙爬到伢家里时成了血淋淋的一条腿啦！伢还说：“你光给俺闹祸害，秋天正忙时您把腿跌着啦！麦忙时又把腿铡住啦！你吃着俺的饭，挣着俺的工钱，俺用着你叫干活哩，不是叫你给俺闹祸害呀！谁叫你铡住腿啦，俺这时也不能找人干活，天生的穷骨头就该你受罪咧！”还说：“南瓜配烙饼，两头受冤曲，你回你家里养去吧！俺这里放不下你。”随即算了算工钱给了五吊钱，没叫吃饭就把俺爹撵出门外啦！这时俺爹觅人用小车推回家去，俺娘见俺爹的腿抱头大哭，整整养了十个月才算长好，成了一个拐子。这时租伢地主的地，伢看俺爹不能劳动啦，怕交不起租子，也不叫种了，说了很多好话才给俺留了三亩。俺家都是吃糠咽菜受着，到春天时，连糠菜也得不上吃，就把俺姐（十三岁）卖了九吊钱，卖到陕口村地主王守恒家。提起俺姐受的罪，俺真是一言难尽，当卖走半年的光景，俺和娘不放心，就去看了一次，谁知一看，俺姐瘦的皮包骨头，不象人样，每天光叫喝稀菜汤，还得纺六两花，纺不够数，除挨打受骂外，连糠菜也不叫吃，叫喝刷锅水，饿的没法时，就背着人吃鸡食和猪食，就这地主看见了，打得更厉害。俺姐从来没睡过炕，都是叫睡在地下，底下铺着一片破席，上边盖着破套子和秆草秸。俺和娘看见她受这罪，就哭着回去啦！走到路上，俺和娘想把俺姐领回来，一想要回家也是饿死，随便伢刻薄吧！过了两个月，俺不放心，和俺娘又去了一次，受的罪更大，原来俺姐偷了一个馍，这一下可闹出了大祸了，随即把俺姐的嘴用针线缝住啦，用剪刀把脚趾头剪断两个（一只脚一个），她婆子又把俺姐浑身上下用剪子剪了一遍，身上都剪成血肉块啦！光这还不算完，又用锥子把俺姐的双手串透了，用线绳子串住手心，俺姐受不住，死了两三次。俺和娘见俺姐放声大哭了。这一哭，地主怕震聋了耳朵，就拼命的推俺叫滚出去，伢还说：“她偷嘴吃，丢了俺家门，砸死也稀松。”那时俺也没敢吭声，想着和地主打官司罢，可是伢是村长，有钱有势，咱连吃的也没有，凭啥打官司呢？俺姐在伢家受了两年，就惨死在伢手里啦！俺父亲听到后，连气连饿，从山崖上一头栽在山沟里碰死啦！俺提起这天大的仇恨，死也忘不了……。
    俺哥哥十三岁给地主放羊，身上生了个疮地主也不管，就一手推到门外啦！到家后，没有吃的，更请不起先生（医生）看病，整天喊饿喊痛的哭叫，受了半年，就活活的连痛带饿的死了。
    俺九岁就给伢放牛，一直放到十七岁上啥苦头都受啦。一九四○年俺到了工厂后，得到格外的温暖，工友与领导同志对俺的亲切热爱，俺说也说不上来。这里就是俺的家，俺决心把革命工作作好，要为俺爹、哥、姐报仇恨。
