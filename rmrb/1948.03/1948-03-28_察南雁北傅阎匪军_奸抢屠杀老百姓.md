The people of southern Chahar and northern Shanxi will never forget the blood debts incurred by the Fu Yan bandit troops. On December 27th of last year, more than 700 cavalrymen of Fu bandit's Provisional 4th Army came to Xiheying in Yu County to rob grain and seize soldiers. After dinner on the 30th, the bandits surrounded Dongdayunting. All the young and middle-aged men had run away, so the bandit army gathered all the men and women of the village into a courtyard to watch over them. Only young women were allowed to return home, and the bandits followed them to rape them. The whole village was filled with cries. Pang Hui's daughter-in-law was gang-raped by sixteen bandits, who also took her clothes. A twelve-year-old girl was also raped. At dawn on the 31st, the bandits surrounded Shangsuzhuang, captured more than a hundred people, and injured two. The bandits also threatened, "If you don't send grain, we will come back and burn your houses." Shuimo Tuan in Hunyuan County was surrounded by Fu bandits on January 27th. The people's property was looted, and all the sheep and chickens were eaten. Even the children's diapers and the women's combs and brushes were taken away. One bandit went into a farmer's house and took a broken pair of women's pants from the kang. The old woman pleaded, "Sir, those are our women's things, please be kind and leave them." The bandit shamelessly replied, "...I have women in my family too." On February 26th, Fu bandit troops from Ying County, Datong, launched a surprise attack on Jia Zhuang Village in Hunyuan County, causing a massacre in which 25 people were brutally killed. When they brutally killed these people, they used extreme punishments such as shooting, beheading, and disembowelment. Chen Xiaoba and others had their hearts gouged out and their genitals cut off.... But the masses did not succumb to this. When the bandits shot the fifteen-year-old child Yu Houtang, they wanted him to kneel on the ground. The stubborn little hero pointed at the bandits and cursed, "Grandpa wouldn't even piss on you. What crime have we committed? Who should kneel to you? Kill if you want to kill, shoot if you want to shoot, I'm old enough to fight you!" He died heroically like this.

　　察南雁北傅阎匪军
  　奸抢屠杀老百姓
    察南雁北的人民将永远不能忘记傅阎匪军给他们造下的血海深仇。去年十二月二十七日，傅匪暂四军七百多骑兵，到蔚县西合营来抢粮抓兵。三十日晚饭后，匪徒们包围了东大云町，青壮男子都已跑掉了，匪军便把全村男女集中到一个院里看起来，只许青年妇女回家，匪徒们便跟着去奸淫，全村到处是哭叫声。庞惠的儿媳被十六个匪徒轮奸后，还把衣服拿走。一个十二岁的女孩也被强奸。三十一日拂晓，匪徒们包围了上苏庄，捉去老百姓百余人，伤了两人后匪徒们还威胁着：“不送粮再来就要烧房子”。浑源的水磨疃，一月二十七日被傅匪包围，群众财物被劫一空，羊鸡被吃一空，就连小孩子的尿布、女人们的梳篦都拿走了。一个匪军进到某农家拿走炕上的一条女人破裤子，老太太哀求说：“先生，那是俺们女人们的东西，行好丢下吧。”匪军不知廉耻的答：“……我家也有女人呀”。二月二十六日大同应县傅匪军奔袭浑源贾庄村，造成了惨杀群众二十五人的大惨案。他们惨杀这些群众时用尽了枪毙、刀砍、挑肚等极刑，陈小巴等多人被剜去心脏，割掉生殖器……。但是群众并没有因此而屈服。当匪徒们枪杀十五岁的儿童于厚堂时，要他跪在地下。倔强的小英雄却指着匪徒大骂：“爷爷尿也不得尿你们，我们犯了什么罪，谁给你跪，要杀就杀，要崩就崩，这么大了照样还和你们干。”他就这样慷慨就义。
