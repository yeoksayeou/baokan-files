An editor's note: The Gaoling Branch has a decade-long history of struggle. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it led the masses in persevering through a brutal border area struggle (such as the famous cave defense battle), and was awarded the honorary titles of "Model Village" and "Model Branch." At the same time, through successive double reductions and land reforms, the entire village has largely achieved equal distribution. However, due to the poor class consciousness of party members, some party members have serious privilege and factionalism, especially since the victory against Japan in 1945, which created a strong sense of accomplishment, believing that "we won the world" and dismissing the contributions of the masses. Party members generally took more fruit, and their style of coercing the masses was very severe. Below is the reflection of Comrade Wang Zhaoyu, the former secretary of the village branch. He boldly exposed and reflected on his mistakes, apologized to the masses, and is willing to accept criticism, review, and education from the masses. The original reflection is excerpted as follows:

　　I am from Gaoling Village, Wuxiang Fourth District, from a middle peasant family, and twenty-five years old this year. I joined the party in 1940 and served as chairman of the district youth salvation association, branch committee, county committee, and border defense committee member. In 1942, I was arrested in border defense work, and my legs were crippled. In the spring of 1945, I became the secretary of our village branch until June 1947.

　　In the spring of 1946, the masses automatically requested liquidation and struggle. Wu Jincheng, chairman of the farmers' association, said after returning from a meeting in the district: "It can be done," and emphasized: "This time is a good opportunity for us (referring to party members and cadres) to turn over a new leaf in eight years. If we miss this time, we won't be able to turn over." At that time, I agreed with this idea in my mind. I thought: no matter what, let's eat and drink first. In the first household to be liquidated, we smoked two catties of water pipe tobacco and twenty-eight boxes of cigarettes (in three days), and every meal was eggs, wine, and white flour. The militiamen also ate well. At that time, we were liquidating debts regardless of poverty (liquidating according to problems). During the liquidation, cadres and party members were treated differently from the masses. The calculations for cadres and party members were progressive, while the masses were counted one by one. If the debt was too large, it would be reduced. We didn't let the masses know how much was calculated, for fear that when the fruits were distributed in the future, the masses would say, "We calculated a lot but got little." When distributing the fruits, two party members were sent to carry all the packages. When several masses came to watch, I drove them and the party members carrying things away, preparing to buy cheap. At night, the cadres picked out all the good clothes. I embezzled seven feet of white cloth and a new mattress. At that time, I thought I was a cadre, so I had to take something. The next day, fearing that the masses would find out, I packed up the remaining bad fruits, and decided in advance who to give what to, and pasted their names on the packages. Some packages contained less inside but had more written outside. When distributing, we first held a poor people's meeting and said, "No one can complain about this fruit distribution, and you can't open it here to check. Take it back and open it." If you found less when you got back, we would say, "No one else is short, only you are!?" and we would rebut them.

　　A female party member from my village came back from her mother's house and told me that the village cadres in her mother's village still earned wages. I used this as an excuse to embezzle fruits and told the branch cadres: We can also earn wages. We sold the fruits, silver dollars, etc., and each big cadre got 800 yuan, each small cadre got 400 yuan, each person got a sheep, and five shares of the medical cooperative. I got the share of a big cadre. We also set a rule that whoever exposed it would be punished. A few days later, two party members from my village found out that we had embezzled the fruits and wanted to report to the district. I wrote letters to the cadres, asking them to give each of them a sheep to buy them off so they wouldn't go.

　　I didn't do work for the masses. What did I think the masses were? How could they interfere with party affairs? I put the party and the masses in opposition, and in reality, "the Gaoling Party was me," and the masses were under my rule.

　　The targets of struggle were designated by me and the branch. The poor people's meeting to pass the nominations (which was arranged in advance) was just a formality. When the land reform movement just started, the poor people nominated a rich peasant household (who was a party member). I thought that since it was not decided by the branch and it was the home of a party member, I turned down the person who made the suggestion. When struggling against the landlords, I specifically ordered a person who had opinions about me and a person who had opinions about the cadres (both were poor hired laborers) to interrogate and beat the landlords to extract things. At that time, my idea was: you can't eat for nothing and also have opinions about the cadres, complaining that you got too little fruit after turning over. Go "provoke" people, and I regarded "struggling" against the landlords as "provoking people" to retaliate against the masses. In addition, when the district was training the "backward" elements, I classified the honest poor people as "backward" and called them to the district for training. My idea was: you just complain that the cadres get more fruit and that the cadres are delayed from work every day, and you can't see it!? You go to training and sort out your thinking. If your thinking is not clear, you will have to delay work for a few days. But my own father and the families of the cadres did not go. Looking at it now, it's not that the poor people are "backward," but that our cadres have oppressed them like that. If they don't turn over, but oppress them, how can they be satisfied with the bad cadres? How can they be active in their work if they don't have food or clothing? If they offer some correct opinions and say a few words of dissatisfaction with the bad cadres, we will call them "dead backward."

　　In the spring of 1947, during the "wash your face and blacken it" campaign, the masses gave me opinions and asked me to return the fruits. I didn't reflect well at that time, but instead, I developed a bad idea, thinking that I had "merit" in the revolution. In the past, we led the struggle against the landlords. After struggling against the landlords, it was our turn. I felt that being a cadre had no good end. I made a hypocritical apology to the masses at the meeting and returned all the fruits. But in the end, the masses firmly refused to let us return the sheep, actually because they were afraid of our retaliation. The masses said they wanted to "rub the chairman of the farmers' association and the branch organization member" (meaning a light beating). I didn't patiently persuade them, but threatened the masses, saying that there was "special agent activity" inside, and I "rectified" the masses. At the same time, I told the cadres: from now on, we must unite well and not dare to have any more problems.

　　When distributing the fruits, I didn't participate myself, and I threatened the masses, saying, "This time, if I go, I will embezzle again." The other cadres didn't go either. The representatives of the masses felt that they couldn't distribute without the cadres, so they called us three times before we went. After going, we distributed unsuitable fruits to the poor people who had given us opinions when resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, retaliating against them. But I helped the military family Wu Sanhai (because his fourth younger brother was a party member) to take over an extra cave of fruits. My idea was that if I take good care of him, I am also a family member of a cadre, and they can also take care of me.

　　Once, when we held a mass meeting to discuss the distribution of fruits, two poor peasants had personal opinions at the meeting. I didn't explain it to him, but ordered them to stop. But they didn't listen, so I led the meeting to break up. They felt terrible and told me many good things and admitted their mistakes. I also punished them for being responsible for convening the meeting. The next day, before dawn, the two of them got up early and called people door to door, went to each house twice, rang the bell, and shouted, saying good things to the masses. I was very happy and said, "Who told you not to listen to me? See how difficult it is to call the masses." I slept peacefully. This kind of practice of playing with the poor is despicable. After the movement, we expanded the army once. When supporting the army, two poor people gave less. I "worked on" their thoughts for half the night at the meeting, saying that they had no conscience, that they didn't turn over enough, that they complained that they got too little fruit, and that they were harming others when supporting the army. After the meeting, this poor peasant said, "It's better not to turn over."

　　When the movement was about to end, the district secretary told me, "You forgot your roots when you turned over, and you have no concept of the poor hired laborers." When I returned to the village, I held poor people's meetings every day. My idea was: this was done wrong after you passed it, and you can't give me any opinions. This is resistance to the masses and dissatisfaction with the criticism from the superiors. But on the contrary, I gave false reports to the superiors, saying that the poor hired laborers in our village had risen up, that they had turned over thoroughly, that there were no problems, and that everything was done by the poor people.

　　After the movement ended, I proposed at the cadre meeting that "county and district cadres eat twenty-four taels a day, only talk but don't move. Our village cadres wear out the soles of their shoes, but can't eat enough. They can still engage in production, but we can't." Everyone discussed and decided to borrow public grain to open a restaurant (because there is a market in Gelaowan in our village). Each person borrowed five dou of public grain wheat and told the warehouse management team leader, "Don't expose it. If you expose it, you are responsible." The person disagreed, saying that this was the superior's system and it was not allowed to be borrowed. I said, "We cadres are responsible. What are you afraid of?" Some of the furniture in the restaurant were also fruits, and the restaurant occupied fruit houses. The public security officer was lazy and asked to go to the restaurant. In order to satisfy him and be my good helper, I let him be the shopkeeper inside. Later, the district secretary found out and wouldn't let us do it, so we looked for loopholes in him to deal with him. A few days later, the district secretary called me for a talk, saying that we had Li Zicheng's hedonistic thinking, that we were enjoying ourselves and didn't care about the masses, and that the masses' reactions were not good. I immediately agreed to come back and clean up, but I went back and acted contrary to what I said, and continued to do the same.

　　In this party consolidation study, I reflected on these things that harmed the people and was very afraid. I felt that I was sorry for the people. But the party still treated me warmly and encouraged me to correct my mistakes. In the future, I must honestly work for the people. Therefore, I further realized my strong sense of accomplishment and serious personal sectarianism. My style was very bad, and I became a new ruler in the countryside. I am determined to return all the embezzled fruits to the masses and apologize to the masses, admit my mistakes to the masses, and sincerely accept the masses' criticism, review, and education. I am determined to stand on the party's position and be a good hired hand for the people.

　　认错改错当好长工
  　武乡高岭前支书王兆宇同志的反省
    按：高岭支部已有十年来斗争历史，在抗日战争中领导群众坚持了残酷的边地斗争（如有名的窑洞保卫战），曾获得“模范村”、“模范支部”的光荣称号。同时经过历次双灭与土改，全村已大体达到了平分。但是由于党员阶级觉悟性差，有些党员存在着严重的特权、宗派思想，特别是自四五年抗日胜利后，更产生了浓厚的功臣思想，认为“天下是我们打下的”，抹煞群众的功劳。党员普遍多占果实，强制群众作风很厉害。下边是该村前支书王兆宇同志的反省，他大胆揭发与反省了自己错误，向群众认错，并愿接受群众的批评审查教育。原反省摘录如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    我是武乡四区高岭村人，家庭是中农成份，今年二十五岁。四○年入党，担任过区青救主席、分委、县委、边防委员会委员等。四二年在边防工作中被捕，双足残废。四五年春当了我村支部书记，直到四七年六月。
    四六年春，群众自动要求清算斗争。农会主席武金成从区开会回来说：“可以搞”，并着重说：“这次是咱们（指党员、干部）八年来一个翻身好机会，要过了这次可就翻不了身了。”当时我思想上很赞成。心想：不管怎样先吃喝一顿再说。清算第一家，光吸了水烟就有二斤，纸烟二十八盒（三天），每顿饭是鸡蛋，酒、白面，民兵也吃。当时是按债不按穷（按问题清算）。清算时，干部党员与群众又是两样，党员干部的算法是累进，群众是一个算一个，如债务太大时，还要往少推算。算出多少，不让群众知道，怕将来分果实时，群众说：“算多得少。”分果实时，派了两个党员把包袱都搬来，有几个群众来看，我就把他们与搬东西的党员一齐赶走，准备贱买。到黑夜，干部把好衣服都拣光了，我贪污了白市布七尺，新褥子一件。当时我认为我是干部可不能不拿。第二天怕群众发觉了，把余下的坏果实都包起来，给谁分甚都先定好名字，贴在包袱上，有的里面包的少，外面写的多。分时，先召开了个穷人会，说“这次分果实谁也不能嫌好道坏，不能在这里翻看，回去再往开拿。”回去少了来找，我们又说：“人家都不短，光你短！？”把他们顶回去。
    我村一个女党员从娘家回来给我说：他娘家的村干部还赚工资。我便找上这个借口，来贪污果实，给支干说：咱们也可以赚。把果实银洋等卖下的钱，大干部八百元，小干部四百元，每人羊一只，医药合作社股金五股。我得的是大干部一份。并定了纪律，谁要暴露处分谁。隔了几天，我村两个党员知道我们贪污了果实，要到区报告，我就给各干部写信，叫给他们各分了羊一只，收买他们才不去了。
    我干工作不是给群众干，认为群众是啥，他还能干涉党的事情？把党与群众对立起来，实际上“高岭党就是我”，群众受我统治。
    斗争对象是我与支部指定出来的，开穷人会通过（事先布置好）是个空名堂。土改运动刚开始，穷人提出一户富农来（是个党员）。我认为一不是支部决定，二又是个党员家，便把提意见的人顶回去。斗争地主时，我专门命令了一个对我有意见的人和一个对干部有意见的（两个都是贫雇）去审打地主，往出要东西。当时思想是：你们不要白吃一份，又给干部提意见，翻身嫌果实得的少，也去“惹惹”人，自己把“斗争”地主当成是“惹人”，来报复群众。另外是区集训“落后”时，我把老实穷人都划成“落后”，叫到区受训。思想是：你们不要光嫌得果实少，干部得的多，干部每天误工，你们就看不见！？你们去受受训也通通思想，思想不通了，工也得误几天。但自己父亲与干部家属却一个也不去，现在来看，不是穷人“落后”，是我们干部把他们压成那样的。翻身不叫翻，并欺压他们，他们对坏干部怎能满意？没吃没穿穷时光，怎能对工作积极！？提些正确意见，说几句不满意坏干部的话，我们即叫他“死落后”。
    四七年春“洗脸擦黑时”，群众给我提意见叫退果实。自己当时不好好反省，反而产生一种坏思想，认为我革命有“功”，以前是咱领导斗地主，斗完地主就轮上咱，觉的当干部没下场，我在会上给群众虚伪的道了一下歉，把果实全部退出来。但最后群众坚决不叫我们退羊子，实际是怕我们报复。群众说要“不搓搓农会主席和支部组织委员”（就是轻打的意思），我不耐心说服，威吓群众说：里边有“特务活动”，就把群众“整”住了。同时我给干部们说：今后咱可要团结好，不敢再起一点蹩扭了。
    到分果实时，自己不去参加，并威胁群众说：“这次我去叫再贪污了”。其他干部也都不去。群众代表觉得没有干部不敢分，一连叫了我们三次才去了。去了后，对在解决干群关系时给我们提意见的穷人，分不适用的果实，报复他们。但我却帮助军属武三孩（因他四弟是党员）多占果实窑一眼。思想是我对他照顾好，我也是干属，他们也能对我照顾。
    有一次开群众会讨论分果实，两个贫农在会上闹私人意见。自己不给他解释，便命令叫停止。但他们不听，自己就领导把会散了。他们觉得了不起，就给我说许多好话，认了错误，我并罚他们负责召开会。第二天天还未亮，他俩一早起来沿门叫人，每家去两次，又打钟、又喊叫、给群众说好话。自己很高兴，并说：“谁叫你们不听我说，看叫群众难不难”，自己却安然睡觉。这种玩弄穷人的作法，是可恶的。搞过运动，跟着就扩了一次军，拥军时两个穷人出的少，我在会上“打通”了半夜思想，说他们没良心，翻身翻不够，得果实嫌少，拥军时害多。会后这个贫农说：“翻身不如不翻。”
    到运动快结束时，区书给我谈：“你们翻身忘了本，没有贫雇观念。”我回到村里，便每天召开穷人会。思想是：这干错了可是经过你们来，可不能给我提意见。这是对群众的抵抗，对上级批评的不满。但反过来，又给上级作假报告，说我村贫雇起来了，翻身彻底了，没有问题了，一切都是穷人干。
    运动结束后，我在干部会上提出“县区干部每天二十四两，光说不动弹，咱们村干光磨鞋底，吃不上饭，他们还能搞生产，咱就不能。”大家讨论决定，借公粮开饭铺（因我村圪老湾有个集市），每人借了公粮麦子五斗，并对仓库保管小组长说：“不能暴露，暴露了你负责。”人家不同意，说这是上级的制度，不准借。自己说：“我们干部负责你怕啥。”饭铺一些家具也都是果实，并占的是果实房子。公安员平素懒，要求到饭铺里，我为了满他的意，当我个好下手，我便让他到里边当掌柜。以后区书知道了，不让干，我们就找他的空子，来对付他。到后几天，区书叫我谈话，说我们是李自成的享乐思想，你们享乐，不管群众，并说群众反映不好。我即答应回来收拾，但回去却阳奉阴违，照旧干。
    这次整党学习中，我反省出这些危害人民的事情来，非常害怕，觉得对不起人民。但党仍以热情相待，鼓励我改正错误，今后要老老实实的为人民，因此我进一步认识了我浓厚的功臣思想与严重的个人宗派主义，作风非常恶劣，成了农村中一个新统治者。我决心把贪污果实全部退还群众，并向群众道歉，向群众承认错误，诚心诚意接受群众对我的批评审查教育，下定决心站到党的立场上，给人民当个好长工。
