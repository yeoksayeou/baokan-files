Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Moscow dispatch: On the 23rd, the people of the Soviet capital held a commemorative meeting at the Moscow Grand Theatre to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Army. When leaders such as Stalin, Molotov, and Zhdanov stepped onto the presidium seats, the audience burst into thunderous applause. The participants unanimously passed a congratulatory letter to Stalin. Stalin modestly suggested that the congratulatory letter be sent to the Soviet Armed Forces. This letter, which fully represents the will of the people of the Soviet Union, declared: "The Soviet people firmly adhere to a policy of peace, while at the same time never forgetting for a moment the warmongers' preparations for a new war. The Soviet people firmly believe that if foreign countries attempt to interfere in our people's peaceful labor and invade the borders of our motherland, our army and navy will certainly defeat and crush the saboteurs of peace." On the eve of the festival, huge streams of tens of thousands of people gathered in Red Square, the Moscow River embankment, and the streets. At 9:00 p.m., salutes were fired, and searchlights shone brilliantly, reflecting each other and forming a huge number "30" in the sky.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: TASS, Moscow, 25th: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has appointed Nikolai Roshchin as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, replacing former Ambassador P.P. Yudin, who resigned due to illness. Roshchin was originally the Major General Military Attaché of the Soviet Embassy in China, having been in China for eight years. He was ordered to return to his country for consultations several weeks ago.

　　莫斯科欢庆建军节
  　苏新命罗申为驻华大使
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】莫斯科讯：廿三日，苏联首都人民在莫斯科大戏院举行纪念会，狂欢庆祝苏军卅周年。当斯大林、莫洛托夫、日丹诺夫等领袖走上主席团座位时，全场掌声雷动。与会者一致通过致斯大林的祝贺信。斯大林则谦逊地建议将祝贺信送给苏联武装部队。这封足以代表全苏人民意志的信宣布：“苏联人民坚决遵循和平政策，同时无论如何片刻都决不忘记战争贩子对新战争的准备。苏联人民坚信：如果外国企图干涉我们人民的和平劳动，侵略我们祖国的边疆，我们的陆海军一定将打败和粉碎和平破坏者”。佳节前夕，成千成万的人民的巨流汇集在红场、莫斯科河堤和大街上。晚间九点钟，礼炮齐鸣、探照灯光芒四射，交相辉映，在天空中组成巨大的数字“三十”。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：苏联最高苏维埃主席团任命尼古拉·罗申为驻华特命全权大使，前大使彼得洛夫因病辞职。按罗申原任驻华大使馆少将武官，已在华八年，数周前奉命返国述职。
