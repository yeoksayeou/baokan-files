　　Correctly Understand the Land Law
  　Seize the Time and Work Hard to Produce
  　Xiao Juze's Group Intensifies Land Reclamation
    [Taihang News] Xiao Juze, a poor peasant from Shiheshu Village, Sixth District, Huguan, understands the spirit of the Land Law, works hard in production, and leads the whole group in reclaiming wasteland. His old home is in Linxian County, and he fled famine to Shiheshu, where he has been herding sheep for more than twenty years. Last winter, he finally turned over. After the Land Law came out, he didn't slack off at all. He said, "Our village has little land, and each person can't get much. If we want to get rich and not go hungry, we still have to find ways to open up some land. Taking advantage of the warm weather this winter, we can work on our own, and we don't have to worry about anyone taking it away." He went up the mountain to reclaim wasteland, and dug more than one cent of land in one day. That night, when he came back, he chatted with people in his mutual aid group, encouraging everyone. Everyone happily said, "If we reclaim wasteland this winter, we can plant potatoes in the spring." The next day, the whole group went up the mountain to reclaim wasteland together. After four days of intensive digging, four full laborers and two half laborers reclaimed a total of two and a half mu of wasteland. They also plan to reclaim all of the five mu of wasteland in that area.
    Shenjiaping Village Enthusiastically Delivers Manure
    [Pingshun News] On the afternoon of the twelfth day of the first lunar month, the masses of Shenjiaping Village, Second District, held a meeting to discuss the current work of transporting fertilizer. First, the leaders pointed out that spring is early this year, and Qingming will be on February 26th. In just over a month, we will be planting. If we don't take the time to transport fertilizer now, we won't have time later. At night, the work of transporting fertilizer was discussed at the people's school. The masses calculated the weather and realized that spring was early this year, and they also had to prepare to implement the Land Law. If they didn't transport fertilizer these days, there would be no time later. After the discussion, a fertilizer transportation plan was formulated: the whole village has 90 full laborers, 14 half laborers, 30 donkeys, and 39 oxen. There are currently more than 15,000 dan of fertilizer in storage, and it is determined to complete the task in eight days from the 13th to the 20th.

　　正确了解土地法
  　抓紧时间勤生产
  　萧聚则组加紧开荒
    【太行消息】壶关六区石河沭村贫农萧聚则，懂清土地法精神，努力生产带领全组开荒。他老家是林县人，逃荒到石河沭，一直放羊二十多年。去冬，才算开始翻了身。土地法下来后，他一点也没松劲。他说：“咱村地少，一口人也分不上多少，要打算发家不受饿，总还得想办法开些地，乘今冬天暖和，自己劳动下，又不怕人家谁拿走了。”他上山开荒，刨了一天，就开了一分多地。当天晚上回来，就和本互助组人闲谈，鼓起大家的劲儿，都高兴的说：“今冬开上荒，明春栽地蔓（山药蛋）”。第二天，全组就一块上山开荒。整刨了四天，四个全劳力、两个半劳力，共开荒地二亩半。他们还打算把那一片五亩多荒地，都开出来。
