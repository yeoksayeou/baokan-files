　　Wu'an Judicial Section Dispatches Specialists to Investigate and Understand
　　Xu Geng's Case Indeed Has Grievances

To the Editor:

　　Regarding Xu Geng's case (see the People's Daily, January 28th), we originally planned to handle it in conjunction with party rectification, because it involved village cadres. At the same time, the masses in that area did not truly hold power, and it was not easy to obtain genuine materials. Later, when a reporter came to visit, it changed our waiting mentality. We conducted research and, based on the current situation, decided to first release Xu Geng and Zhao Yu. Our reasons were: (1) This case had been handled by the county three years ago, and it was found that the "human bones" were donkey bones. At that time, there was no concrete evidence. (2) Although Xu Geng's confession cannot be taken as the primary basis, it did not have any major contradictions and was consistent with Zhao Yu's confession. (3) The old case from a few years ago was not overturned at that time but was overturned a year later (1945), and again last year (1947). The people who presided over the overturning of the case were: a landlord, Cao Baogui, and a political director with a bad reputation. Combined with the donkey bone issue, there was a suspicion of injustice. (4) Xu Geng and Zhao Yu are both poor peasants, and the case lacks concrete human and material evidence. Therefore, we released them on January 28th and ordered the village to return all the confiscated items to maintain her livelihood.

　　After they were released, due to limited manpower, we instructed the district public office to solicit the reflections of the masses in the village on this matter. However, the district was not very concerned and did not send anyone to investigate and understand. Recently, we sent a comrade to conduct an investigation. Because the village has not yet established a genuine poor peasant association and a new farmers' association, we focused on interviewing witnesses and soliciting the reflections of the general public. Due to the publication of this matter in the newspaper, the masses began to change their psychology of not daring to talk. In particular, Lao Gui Fang, a long-term worker who was a witness in this case, came forward very frankly to testify. He said, "What was published in the newspaper is completely true. I did see Xiao Guo in Yangyi in 1944. In May of the following year, I returned to the village and heard that Xu Geng was accused, but I didn't dare to say anything because I was afraid." According to Xue Wenlin, a neighbor of Xu Geng's named Er Guai (he is disabled, works as a helper in a restaurant, and is now the secretary of the farmers' association, and he is a cripple), "What was said in the newspaper is completely true, but it is not accurate if my name is not published." He continued, "The first incident was done by Cao Baogui. One day, Jin Xianzhu (director of the Armed Forces Committee), Cao Xuede (head of the Third Street), and Fan Sheng (militia captain) took me to the cooperative, locked the gate, and presented me with three conditions: (1) Say whatever you are told to say. (2) If you don't say it, you will be put in stocks. (3) You must testify that Xu Geng killed her husband and buried him in the yard." At that time, I was afraid that if I was put in stocks, I would break my leg again, so I agreed to testify. Later, when testifying at the county trial office, I said: "I heard a noise in the night, but I didn't see it with my own eyes." The masses reflected that everyone knew that donkey bones were used as human bones. Because they were compared at the meeting, one bone was similar to a human bone, but another was different, so they didn't pursue it further. Regarding this retrial, according to the masses, everyone did not mention confiscating Xu Geng's belongings and beating her. According to village correspondent Cao Qing, "The masses did not mention it at all this time. Jin Xianzhu first came to arrange for my wife to accuse Xu Geng, but she was unwilling to. He then worked on Cao Xuede's wife. One day, after squeezing out feudalism, Cao Xuede's family proposed: 'Xu Geng is a family member of revolutionary soldiers and should be treated preferentially, but her husband's life or death is unknown, so she should answer.' Before Xu Geng could answer, she was detained." According to further investigation, Jin Xianzhu, who was involved in this case twice, served as the director of the Armed Forces Committee. Because he oppressed the masses, he was impeached by the masses and his right to speak was suspended. However, he still made decisions on everything in the village. His behavior was very bad. He borrowed grain from the masses, and if they refused to lend it, he would use his power to retaliate. He spoke harshly, and one person could overturn the decisions of the masses. It is also said that during the old government era, Jin Xianzhu's brother was executed for illegal activities, and it was said that Xu Geng revealed this, so he harbored a grudge. Judging from the above materials, the case of Xu Geng's adultery and murder cannot be established because there is no concrete evidence. Based on the conversations of Lao Gui Fang and Er Guaizi, as well as Jin Xianzhu's behavior and active participation in this case, the reasons for the successive retrials were investigated: The initial cause of the first retrial was mainly the landlord Cao Baogui retaliating for land confiscation. Jin Xianzhu took advantage of his position to help and seek private revenge, using fake bones and coercing Er Guaizi to give false testimony, all of which were methods of framing and slander. Conversely, it can also serve as concrete evidence that Xu Geng did not commit murder. The reason for the second retrial may be that the political director had a conflict with Xu Geng, and Jin Xianzhu used their conflict to seek private revenge again. It can be generally determined that Xu Geng did not harm her husband, but the complete truth remains to be clarified during party rectification. After Xu returned to the village, the items have not been fully returned. The family has pots, pans, bedding, and old door curtains and was given forty catties of grain and twenty catties of corn.

　　The Xu case profoundly educates us on two points: (1) We lack a clear class stand and viewpoint in dealing with cases, so we have wronged some middle and poor peasants, which is tantamount to infringing on their personal freedom. (2) There is a strong tendency towards bureaucracy and subjectivism. Although the department has limited manpower, we should try all means to conduct in-depth investigations. In the past, we listened too much to the one-sided materials of district and village cadres, and sometimes even used them as the only reliable basis for solving problems, which is wrong. In the future, we should conduct in-depth investigations, carefully and repeatedly study the issues, and consider the issues objectively and comprehensively, so as not to wrong a good person and accurately judge a case that should be punished according to the people's laws, and faithfully serve the people as a good long-term worker and build a new democratic judicial work.

### 武安司法科派专人调查了解　徐更的案确有冤屈

专栏：

　　武安司法科派专人调查了解
  　徐更的案确有冤屈编辑同志：
    徐更的案件（见一月二十八日人民日报），我们原来准备结合填补整党来处理，因为涉及到村干部，同时该地群众没有真正当权，还不容易得到真实材料。后来记者同志来访问，改变了我们的等待心理，进行了研究，并根据当前情况的发展，决定先把徐更的、赵玉释放，根据是：（一）这案在前三年县里处理过，查明“人骨”是驴骨，当时没有确实证据。（二）徐更的口供，虽然不能作为主要根据，但尚没有重大矛盾，与赵玉口供尚相吻合。（三）几年前的老案，不翻于当时，却翻于一年后（三十四年），又翻于去年（三十六年），主持翻案的：一个是地主曹宝贵，一个是为人不正派的政治主任，并结合驴骨问题看，不无有冤屈之嫌。（四）徐更的、赵玉都是贫农，且案件无确实人证物证。因此在一月二十八日便把他们释放了，着村把没收的东西如数退回，以维持她的生活。
    他们释放后，我们因人力有限，曾着该区区公所，吸收该村群众对这事的反映，但该区不甚关心，也没有专人去调查了解。最近我们派一个同志做了调查，因为该村还没有成立真正贫农团与新农会，所以着重在向证人调查和吸收一般群众反映。由于报上登了这件事。群众开始改变了不敢谈的心理，特别有关这案的证人老长工老桂芳，很直爽的出头作证了。他说：“报上登的完全不假，民国三十三年确在阳邑见过小国的，第二年五月俺回村听说徐更的被告发，咱不敢吭、害怕。”另据徐更的对门邻居二拐的薛文林（他是没法人，在饭铺里当帮工，现在农会当书记，是拐子）说：“报上说的完全是实事，但不登我的名字就不确实。”他接着说：“头一次的事是由曹宝贵搞的，有一天靳现珠（武委会主任）、曹学德（三街街长）、樊生（民兵队长）把我弄到合作社，关起大门，向我提出三个条件：（一）叫你说啥就说啥。（二）不说就押杠，（三）要你作证徐更的杀夫并埋在院内；当时我害怕，恐怕压了杠，再把一条腿弄坏，便答应出头作证，后来在县承审处作证时说：“黑夜听到响声，但没有亲眼见”。群众反映说：驴骨当人骨大家都知道。因为在会上比过，一条骨头恰同人骨相仿，可是另一条就不一样，从此就没有追下去。这次翻案，据群众反映：大家都不知道没收徐更的东西和吊打她，据村通讯员曹庆的说：“这次群众根本没有提，就是靳现珠曾先来布置我老婆，叫提徐更的，她不愿提，他便活动了曹学德老婆。一天挤罢封建后，曹学德家提出：‘徐更的是抗属应该优待，但男人死活不明，叫她答复。’徐更的未及答复就被扣起来了。”又据了解，与此案二次有关的靳现珠当过武委会主任，因为欺压群众，曾被群众罢免并停止发言权，可是村上啥事仍由他作主，他的行为非常坏，向群众借粮，不借就要利用职权来报复，说话硬，一个人可以推翻群众决定。民国三十年曾揽人赌钱，赢了取走，灌人粮食，输了赖帐。又据说：旧政府时代，靳现珠的兄弟做过违法事被毙了，说是由徐更的说出，便结下仇气。从上面的材料看，徐更的通奸杀人案，没有确实证据，不能成立的。根据老桂芳与二拐子的谈话以及靳现珠的行为与积极参与这案，追查它先后翻案原因：第一次翻案起因是地主曹宝贵主要报复抽地，靳现珠顺势帮凶利用职权来报私仇，弄假骨与压迫二拐子作假证，都是栽赃诬人的手法。相反的恰也可作为徐更的没有杀人的具体证据。第二次翻案原因，可能政治主任与徐更的有矛盾，靳现珠就利用他们矛盾再来报私仇。徐更的未害男人大致可以确定，但全部真相尚有待于整党时来弄个明白。徐回村后，还没有完全退还东西，家里有了锅碗铺盖与旧门帘，给了四十斤谷子，二十斤玉米。
    对于徐案深刻的教育我们二点：（一）我们对待案件缺乏明确的阶级立场与观点，因此冤枉了一些中贫农，无异侵害了他们的人身自由。（二）存在浓厚的官僚主义与主观主义作风，虽然科内人力有限，但应想尽一切方法去深入调查。过去太听信区村干部的片面材料，有时甚至作为解决问题的唯一可靠的根据，这是错误的。今后应该深入调查，细致反复研究，客观的全面的考虑问题，才能不冤枉一个好人和恰如其分的按人民法令判决一个应治罪的案件，忠实的为人民当个好长工与建设新民主主义的司法工作。（武安县司法科）
