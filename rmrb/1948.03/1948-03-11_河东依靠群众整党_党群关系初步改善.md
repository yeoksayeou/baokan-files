　　[This report] News: The establishment of the Hedong branch was later than the surrounding villages, only established in the spring of last year (1947). Except for one veteran, all were new party members. Of the nine party members, four were poor peasants and five were middle peasants. No party education had ever been conducted. The party members had no idea about the Party Constitution, the rights and obligations of party members, etc., and only thought that they could enjoy special rights after joining the Party, and others would not dare to detain them if they made mistakes. Party member and public security officer Duan Ermao said: "When I joined the party, the director said, 'Work hard, you will have a 'future' in the future, don't be angry, it doesn't matter if you say something wrong.'" Meng Fanlu (deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee) joined the party so that his name could be published in the newspaper after his death.

　　Party member cadres and activists, a total of thirty-two people, had a set of working methods that they thought were "democratic": when work came, it was first discussed by the branch, then "passed" by non-party cadres and activists, and then "passed" at the mass meeting. The masses did not dare to raise any opinions. The party member cadres were complacent, thinking they were following the mass line. The political director said in his reflection: "I believe in the cadres, not in the masses. I think the masses should rely on the activists to turn over. If the activists are satisfied, they will do a good job of turning over for the masses."

　　After the Land Law was issued, the party members were in a state of emotional depression and ideological confusion. The middle-peasant party members felt that the poor and hired peasants were in power and they were disappointed, afraid of moving their land, so they might as well eat something good as soon as possible. Some were afraid of being struggled against, and complained that the political director should not have introduced them. The first branch meeting first conducted party education. At this time, the party members began to realize that there were shortcomings in the past work, and they should seriously examine themselves, but they had no real determination to correct them, just wanting to perfunctorily deal with it and let the movement pass. In order to expose their true thoughts, they held a self-criticism meeting, but there was still no progress. After explaining the Party's policy to them repeatedly, inspiring self-awareness to break through their concerns, and giving appropriate pressure, the political director took the lead in reflecting, but not in depth. Some said that they had not been cadres for long, so there was nothing to say. Some talked about big mistakes in empty terms, with little connection to specific thoughts, maintained harmony with each other, and did not break through their face-saving. After the reflection was over, their emotions relaxed, and they felt it was almost over. So the work team declared that they would make the party members public and invite the masses to participate in the rectification. At this time, the party members panicked, feeling that they had not reflected well, and if they were made public, they would collapse, and they asked for a chance to reflect well again. Only the political director expressed confidence, but was worried that other comrades would not pass, so he was worried and could not eat. He said, "If other comrades don't pass, what responsibility will I bear?" At this time, seize the time and hold another branch meeting to explain the spirit of party rectification again. This time, criticism was launched. Some said: "It would be better to rectify it this way earlier, and it is guaranteed to make fewer mistakes." On February 15th, a village-wide meeting announced the list of party members, explained the significance of party rectification, encouraged the masses to raise opinions, and guaranteed no retaliation. Honest peasants almost all spoke, only a very few people had personal revenge. Then, thirty mass representatives were selected to give opinions to the branch. The opinions of the masses were roughly divided into the following categories: 1. Unfair distribution of fruits, without taking care of the poor and hired. 2. Selfishness, profiting or occupying good fruits. 3. Accounts are not made public, not democratic. 4. Mutual protection. 5. Eating struggle meals. When the representatives raised their opinions, each person first represented others, and then raised their own, which was very serious and responsible. If someone's proposal deviated from the actual situation, another person would immediately stand up and correct it. The party members felt that it was fair and well-intentioned, and the knots in their minds were untied.

　　Before the establishment of the Poor Peasants' Association, party members were reviewed. Before the meeting, the party members themselves deliberated, and everyone recommended that the political director reflect first, and those with more problems were placed behind. As a result of the review, eight party members passed six (another one was not reviewed due to time constraints). Those who passed were in a happy mood, and those who did not pass cried on the spot. When the village chief reflected, because his heart was beating nervously and he didn't completely let go of his face, he forgot a few questions. Even though he had passed, he still asked for a chance to reflect to the masses again. Those who did not pass also reviewed that they did not reflect well because they had burdens in their minds, and they were determined to reflect well the second time. At the second review meeting, these two people passed very smoothly. Only the deputy director of the Farmers' Association was left, because his attitude of reflection was not good, and he spoke vaguely, so it was decided to continue to reflect. Eight of the nine party members have passed, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has been initially improved.

### 河东依靠群众整党　党群关系初步改善

　　河东依靠群众整党　党群关系初步改善
    【本报消息】河东支部的建立较附近几个村子都晚，是在去年（四七年）春天才建立的。除了一个退伍军人外，都是新党员，九个党员中四个贫农五个中农，党内教育从未进行过，党员们根本就不知道还有什么党章、党员的权利义务等，只认为入党后可以享受特别权利，有了错误别人也不敢随便扣押。党员公安员段二毛说：“入党时主任说好好干吧，将来有‘前途’，受不了气，说错话了也不要紧。”孟凡禄（武委会副主任）入党是为了死后能在报上登个名。
    党员干部积极分子结合在一起共三十二人，有着自以为“民主”的一套工作方式：工作来了先经支部讨论，再经非党干部积极分子“通”，然后到群众大会上去“过”，群众有意见不敢提，党员干部自鸣得意以为走了群众路线。政治主任反省时说：“相信干部，不相信群众，我认为群众翻身要靠积极分子，叫积极分子满意了，他们就会很好的为群众闹翻身。”
    土地法下来后，党员情绪消沉思想混乱。中农党员感到贫雇掌权自己败兴，怕动自己的地，不如乘早吃点好的，有的怕挨斗争，埋怨政治主任不该把他介绍进来。第一次支部会上先进行了党内教育。这时党员开始认识过去工作中有缺点，应该好好检讨，但无认真改正的决心，只是想敷衍一下，运动过去就算了。为了让他们暴露真实思想，又由他们自己开了个检讨会，结果还是毫无进展，经向他们再三解释党的政策，启发自觉打破顾虑，并给以适当压力，政治主任首先开始反省，但不深入，有的说当干部不久，没啥说，有的空谈错误大，少联系具体思想，互相间保持和气，抓不破情面。反省一完，情绪就松下来，觉得差不多了。于是工作组便声明要公开党员，请群众参加整党。这时党员才恐慌起来，觉得没反省好，一公开就要垮了，要求给机会再好好反省一次。只有政治主任表示有信心，但是担心其他同志通不过，愁得吃不下饭，他说：“假使其他同志通不过，我负的啥责呢？”这时争取时间，又召开支部会，再次解释整党精神，这一次才展开了批评。有的说：“早这样整一下就好了，保险少犯错误。”二月十五日全村大会上宣布了党员名单，讲明整党意义，鼓励群众提意见，保证不报复。老实农民差不多都说了话，只有极少数人带有个人报复情绪。接着选了三十个群众代表到支部提意见，群众意见大致有以下几类：一、分果实不公，没有照顾贫雇。二、自私自利多占或占好果实。三、帐目不公布，不民主。四、互相包庇。五、吃斗争饭。代表们提意见，每人都是先代表别人的，后提自己的，十分认真负责，有人提的与实际有出入的，别一个就立即起来更正。党员们觉得公正善意，思想上解开了疙瘩。
    贫农团成立前，进行了审查党员，会前党员自己酝酿，大家推政治主任先反省，问题多的排在后面。审查结果，八个党员通过六个（另一个因时间关系未审查），通过的心情愉快，通不过的当场就哭了。村长在反省时因为心跳紧张和面子没有完全放下，忘了几个问题，虽已通过，还要求有机会再向群众反省一次。未通过的也检讨了反省不好是因为思想上有包袱，决心第二次好好反省。第二次的审查会上，这两个人很顺利地通过了。只剩下农会副主任因反省态度不好，吞吞吐吐，决定再继续反省，九个党员已通过八个，党群关系已初步改善。
