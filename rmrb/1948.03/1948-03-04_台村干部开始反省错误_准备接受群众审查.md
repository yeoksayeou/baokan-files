　　Tai Village Cadres Begin to Reflect on Mistakes
　　Prepare to Accept Mass Review
　　[Taihang News] Cadres from Tai Village, Fourth District of She County, who were originally from poor peasant and farmhand backgrounds, are honestly studying important documents such as the "Letter to Party Members," "Letter to Farmers," and the "Regulations on Punishing Corruption," and are examining their mistakes of "forgetting their roots." Fu Yangshun (poor peasant), the director of political affairs, said: "I worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord when I was twelve years old, and continued for seven or eight years. I only became a cadre after the Eighth Route Army arrived. During the movement the year before last, my class consciousness was not clear. I spoke for a rich peasant woman who had a child, and we agreed that it would be for a few years; but I wanted to get more land and fruits, so I added the child to my household registration, and as a result I got more. Also, in the past few years, I accepted a lot of gifts and ate a lot of meals when handling matters such as mass weddings, divorces, and land sales. Last winter, after the Land Law was issued, I thought: I have divided seven or eight mu of good fruit land before and after, and my family has everything. But six households including the poor peasants Cheng Liren and old man Hou Shutang can't even get through the new year. I thought: We were poor people before, and we only have food to eat because the Communist Party came! We can't forget the poor people who still have no way to live. I still have sympathy for our poor people, but I have made a lot of mistakes." Li Zhengxiang (poor peasant for three generations), the director of civil education, said: "When dividing the fruits the year before last, my family of three divided five good rooms, while the poor peasant Li Youku's family of four only divided three dilapidated rooms. When rewarding model fighters, I was not active at first, but the cadres supported each other, so they gave me 5,000 yuan. The year before last, when × Wen Ting was burning tiles in Mao Lin Bottom, I wanted to be involved, but I didn't, so I claimed an empty share at the beginning and got 12,000 yuan. Now I feel that dividing too many fruits, agricultural association rewards, and claiming empty shares all take advantage of the interests of our poor people, and I want to return them." Fan Xiaosi (poor peasant), the public security officer, said: "The year before last, the militia committee director Song Ben Shun didn't have a wife. After Cheng Linlin (a landlord woman) divorced her husband, she wanted to marry Fu Heidan (a farmer), but I didn't agree. I falsely accused him of instigating Linlin's divorce, detained him in the village office, gathered eight militiamen, and hung him up and beat him three times, scaring Heidan so much that he didn't dare to marry Linlin. Then I said to Linlin: If you marry Gen Shun, I guarantee you won't have any problems. As a result, she was forced to marry Gen Shun. This thing is really bad." After these cadres of poor peasant origin examined themselves, they all expressed that from now on they would honestly serve the masses, wait for a thorough cleansing during the movement, and admit their mistakes to the masses.
　　[Another News] Cadres of Jincun Village, Second District of Lucheng, reflect on their various mistakes of taking too many fruits and oppressing the masses. Since the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, the cadres of the village have mostly become depressed and their thoughts are very confused. On the tenth night of the first lunar month, while studying the "Letter to Party Members," everyone talked about themselves in connection with it. At the beginning, they first examined that their negative work in the past few days was wrong, and realized that as long as they thoroughly reflected on their mistakes, admitted them in front of the masses, returned the fruits they had taken too much, and corrected their mistakes, they could still stand with the masses. Then, the cadres jointly examined the over-occupation of fruits: for example, they should have been classified as third-class fruit distribution, but they were not satisfied, so they privately raised the grade and openly occupied more fruit. There are also speculative methods of "you support me and I protect you," and cadres privately steal and divide the fruits. Dong Cang, the director of the militia committee, said: "We used to be a swarm that no one could provoke. Once, because Guo Zhi De (district branch secretary) and the old village chief Niu Shuzhi were involved with women, the woman's husband was dissatisfied, and we happened to find them eavesdropping. We labeled him a special agent, detained him, and beat him half to death." Feng Chun, the former public security director, said: "Our work was not done well, and the people were not aware. When someone said that standing guard was useless, I labeled him a special agent and detained him." After this preliminary reflection, all the cadres felt that their mistakes were serious, and decided to study and reflect in two groups every morning, to wash each other's faces and put down their burdens, and to prepare to admit their mistakes to the masses during the movement, and to accept opinions for correction.

　　台村干部开始反省错误
  　准备接受群众审查
    【太行消息】涉县四区台村，贫雇出身的干部，老老实实学习“告党员书”“告农民书”“贪污治罪条例”等重要文件，检讨自己“忘本”的错误。政治主任傅羊顺（贫雇）说：“我十二岁就给人家老财住长工，一直住了七八年，自八路军来后，我才当了干部。前年运动时，我阶级观念不明确，说了个富农女人，带个小孩，约定是养几年；可是我想多分土地果实，就把这个小孩打在我家人口里，结果多分上了。还有，前好几年办群众结婚、离婚、卖地等事情，接受送礼、吃人家饭很多。去年冬天，土地法下来后，我想：自己前后分了七八亩好果实地，家里啥也有。可是贫农程利仁、侯树堂老汉等六户，就过不了年；我想：咱原来也是穷人，共产党来了才有饭吃呀！不能忘了现在还没有法过的穷人。我对咱穷人的心也有，可我犯的毛病也不少。”民教主任李正祥（三辈贫雇）说：“前年分果实，我家三口人就分了五间好房，贫农李有库四口人才分了三间破房。在奖励斗争模范时，我本来不积极，可是干部互相拥护，就给我五千块钱。前年×文廷在毛林底烧瓦，我要去受，可没有受，开头就顶了个空股，分钱一万二千元。现在感觉多分果实、农会奖励、顶空股都是占了咱穷人利益，我要往回退。”公安员樊小四（贫农）说：“前年，武委会主任宋本顺没老婆，程林林（地主妇女）和他男人离婚后，要跟傅黑旦（农民）结婚，我不同意，就假说他挑拨林林离婚，扣在村公所，集合了八个民兵，吊起来打了三顿，吓的黑旦不敢和林林结婚。我又给林林说：你要和根顺结了婚，保险你没有问题。结果就强迫和根顺结婚啦。这事情实在不好。”这些贫雇出身干部检查后都表示从今要老老实实给群众办事，等待运动时彻底洗脸，向群众认错。
    【又讯】潞城二区靳村干部，反省自己多占果实，压迫群众的各种错误。自公布土地法大纲后，该村干部大都苦闷起来，思想很混乱，阴历正月初十夜，学习“告党员书”，大家就连系自己闲谈。开头先检讨了前几天消极工作不对，认识了只要彻底反省错误，在群众面前承认，退出多占果实，改正错误，就还能和群众站在一起。接着，干部共同检讨了多占果实：如本来应划在三等分果实，自己不满意，就私自提高等级，公开多占果实。还有拿“你拥我护”的投机办法，干部私自偷分果实。武委会主任东仓说：“咱过去真是一窝蜂不能惹，有一回，因郭支德（区分书）和旧村长牛树支搞女人，人家男人不满意，正偷听被咱发觉，就给人家按上特务帽子扣起来，打的死去活来。”旧公安主任逢春说：“咱工作没作到，老百姓不觉悟，说个站岗放哨不顶事，我就给带上特务帽子扣起来。”经过这样初步反省后，各干部都感觉自己错误严重，决定每天早上分两个小组学习反省，互相洗脸放包袱，准备运动时向群众认错，和接受意见改正。
