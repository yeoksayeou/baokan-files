Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th. The Dazhong Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Great Victory on the Jiaoji Railway Line," pointing out that the great victory on the Jiaoji Railway Line is the prelude to the East China Liberation Army's spring offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shandong. From the 11th to the 20th, in ten days, we have captured and recovered twelve important cities and towns, including Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Zichuan, Boshan, Huantai, Changshan, Zouping, Qidong, Zhangqiu, Laiwu, Linzi, and Mengyin. We controlled over 300 li of the Jiaoji Railway from Yidu in the west to Hancang in the east, including the Zhang (dian) Bo (shan) branch line. We annihilated over 30,000 enemy troops, including the 32nd Division of the reorganized army and the Zibo Garrison Brigade. We quickly and satisfactorily completed the pre-determined plan of this campaign and achieved brilliant results. The editorial then analyzed the significant strategic importance and political impact of this great victory, stating: Since the Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive last autumn, our East China Field Army's eastern corps has correctly carried out the task of annihilating the enemy within the inner lines in Shandong. The great victory at the Jiaohe River in October reversed the situation and turned it into a counter-offensive. Then, the victories on the Jiaogao Line in November and Laiyang in December forced the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to be completely on the defensive at points and lines. With the start of the spring offensive this year, the great victory on the Jiaoji Railway Line will bring about a major fundamental change in the Shandong situation. Our army has begun to break the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' point-and-line defense system, compressing the enemy who has penetrated into our liberated areas into several isolated strongholds, making it impossible for them to escape the fate of final annihilation. From then on, our East China Liberation Army will gain greater mobility and cooperate with the National People's Liberation Army to carry out continuous and powerful offensives. The great victory on the Jiaoji Railway Line is closely linked to the nationwide Liberation Army's comprehensive spring offensive. The series of victories in Yichuan in the Northwest, Jiaoji in East China, Siping in the Northeast, and Luoyang in the Central Plains demonstrate that under the wise strategic guidance of Chairman Mao, the will of the National People's Liberation Army is concentrated, its actions are coordinated, and its movements are unified. Therefore, once the offensive is launched, it carries the force of thunder, giving the Chiang Kai-shek gang a heavy blow. The simultaneous achievement of brilliant victories on all battlefields will further inspire and encourage the National Liberation Army's confidence in resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilating all enemies. At the same time, it will further accelerate the internal collapse and disintegration of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　In the short ten days of the Jiaoji Campaign, our army achieved significant results with very few casualties, which especially demonstrates that our army has implemented the class line of army building during the winter rest and reorganization, implemented the three-check and army consolidation movement, and improved its skills in attacking fortifications, thus enabling it to be invincible and unconquerable. The great victory on the Jiaoji Railway Line has powerfully protected the current spring plowing and disaster relief movement, creating extremely favorable conditions, which will inspire the people in the entire Shandong liberated areas and newly recovered areas to have the confidence to overcome the deep disasters inflicted on us by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits last year, so as to further exert the people's strength to support the front. The editorial finally emphasized that the spring offensive of our East China Liberation Army is in full swing. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will inevitably beg for more aid from American imperialism, further exploit the people, and organize all its reactionary forces before its impending collapse to make a desperate struggle. The disaster situation in our Shandong liberated areas is still serious this year. Therefore, any negligence, pride, relaxation, or complacency is wrong. We must use a cautious and tense spirit to overcome various difficulties in the development of victory and strive for final victory.

　　大众日报评胶济线大捷
    十天作战迫敌退入孤立据点
    蒋匪无法逃避最后覆灭命运
    【新华社华东二十六日电】大众日报顷以“胶济线大捷”为题发表社论，指出胶济大捷是华东解放军对山东蒋匪的春季攻势的序幕。从十一日到二十日的十天中，我已攻克和收复重要城市周村、张店、淄川、博山、桓台、长山、邹平、齐东、章邱、莱芜、临淄、蒙阴等十二处，控制胶济铁路益都以西韩仓以东包括张（店）博（山）支路共三百余里，歼匪整三十二师及淄博警备旅等共三万余人，迅速圆满的完成了这一战役的预定计划，并获得辉煌战果。社论继分析这一伟大胜利的重大的战略意义与政治影响称：去年秋解放军大举反攻以后，我华东野战军东线兵团在山东正确地执行了内线歼敌的任务，十月胶河大捷，扭转战局转入反攻。接着十一月胶高线及十二月莱阳之捷，又迫使蒋匪完全处于点线防御。今年春季攻势开始，胶济线大捷更将使我山东局势，发生一个重大的基本变化，我军开始打碎蒋匪的点线防御体系，把伸入我解放区内部的敌人压缩到几个孤立据点中去，使之最后无法逃避覆灭的命运。从此我华东解放军将获得更大的机动性，配合全国人民解放军实行连续强大攻势。胶济线大捷是与全国解放军全面春季攻势紧密结合的，西北宜川、华东胶济、东北四平、中原洛阳这一连串的胜利，说明了在毛主席英明的战略指导下，全国人民解放军的意志是集中的，动作是协同的，行动是统一的，因而攻势一发动，即挟着雷霆万钧之势，给蒋匪帮以沉重的打击。各战场同时取得辉煌胜利，将更加激励和鼓舞全国解放军坚决彻底干脆歼灭全部敌人的信心。同时也就更加促使蒋匪内部的崩溃和瓦解。
    胶济战役短短的十天，我军仅以很少的伤亡，取得重大战果，尤其说明我军在冬季休整中，贯彻了建军的阶级路线，实行了三查整军运动，及攻坚技术的提高，因而能战无不胜，攻无不克。胶济线大捷，有力的保卫了当前正在进行的春耕生产救灾运动，创造了极有利的条件，将振奋全山东解放区和新收复区人民有信心战胜去年蒋匪所给予我们深重的灾难，以便更大发挥人民的力量支援前线。社论最后强调称，我华东解放军的春季攻势，方兴未艾，然而蒋介石匪帮必然会更加向美帝国主义乞援，及更加压榨人民，组织其行将崩溃前的一切反动力量来作垂死挣扎。我山东解放区今年灾荒仍是严重，因此，任何疏忽骄傲，松懈自满，都是不对的，我们必须以谨慎而又紧张的精神来克服胜利发展中的各种困难，争取最后的胜利。
