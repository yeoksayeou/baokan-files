    [Xingtai News] The root of the suffering of the masses in Hequ Village, Second District, is the flooding they experience every two to three years. Spring floods prevent cultivation, and summer rains lack drainage ditches, leading to prolonged flooding that forces farmers into destitution. The masses say, "If we don't eliminate the flooding in our village, the suffering of the masses will never end. If we could dig a drainage ditch, it could save 1,500 mu of land, increasing grain production by two dou per mu each year, allowing our village to establish a foundation for prosperity." The location for the ditch is at Lianzi Pit in the northeast of the village, with a length of over 300 zhang and a width of five chi. Furthermore, our village is very poor, with only one hundred households. We hope the leadership can help us solve this flooding problem and provide us with some solutions. (Village Head Liu Wenkui, Teacher Chen Xinghua)

    邢台河曲群众要求帮助他们消灭水灾
    【邢台消息】二区河曲村，群众受罪的穷根就是三年两头受到水灾。春天的水返涨不能耕种，夏天下雨没有退水沟，常久的水灾逼的农民没法。群众说：“要不把咱村的水灾消灭，咱村群众受罪没头，如要挑开一道退水沟，就能救出土地一千五百亩，每亩每年增产粮二斗，咱村就能扎下富根。”河的地点就在村东北连子坑，长三百多丈，宽五尺。另外我村可是穷村，一百户人家，希领导上能帮助我们解决这水灾问题，给我们想些办法。（村长刘文魁、教员陈兴华）
