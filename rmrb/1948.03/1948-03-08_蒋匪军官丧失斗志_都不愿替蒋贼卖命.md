Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 5th: According to delayed news from Guangzhou: A mood of defeat has spread among Chiang's military cadres. In October last year, an officer who returned to Guangzhou from another place spoke of the Shandong battlefield, saying, "The military cadres of the Nationalist (Chiang's) army on the front line are timid as mice," "Completely lacking fighting spirit, even Hai Jingqiang (brigade commander of the reorganized 188th Brigade), Bai Chongxi's nephew, a man as arrogant and fierce, was captured without resistance." Another officer of the 46th Army, who was wounded in the Battle of Laiwu, said: "I am not only uninterested in the high-sounding 'bandit suppression' orders from above, but I have also lost confidence in the combat effectiveness of my unit. Now that my wounds have not yet healed, I am about to set off again. I hope, by the spirit of the late Premier, that this time I will be captured instead of wounded." Another report: The Shanghai "Observation" magazine, which is related to the Chiang bandits, published a letter on January 10th this year from a "serving soldier" currently stationed in the Pingjin-Baoding area, also revealing the growing war-weariness and anti-war sentiment among Chiang's military officers. The letter stated: "...Now I feel that all hope has been shattered. I joined the army because of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now I have been used as a tool to maintain the interests of a few individuals. My destiny is determined by others. Youth, education, parents, and life will be lost meaninglessly. I now understand Remarque's (Note: Remarque is a famous German anti-war writer) sorrow!"

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, March 6th: A group of Chiang's 3rd Army lieutenants and captains, liberated in the Qingfengdian Campaign, joined the People's Liberation Army on January 28th and were warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians. After more than two months of study, they deeply recognized Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous crimes and regretted fighting a civil war for Bandit Chiang. Among those approved were Wang Foyin, the captain of the mortar company of the 96th Regiment of the former Chiang's 3rd Army 32nd Division, and 55 others.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, March 6th: The Liaodong Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has released more than 1,500 captured Chiang's military officers and captains (including more than 20 family members) in the past seven months, including Liu Shengchang, the lieutenant colonel deputy commander of the 3rd Regiment of the former Chiang's 60th Army Provisional 21st Division, He Fazhao, the lieutenant colonel quartermaster director of the 84th Division, and Wang Lie, the lieutenant colonel quartermaster director of the 116th Division, and ten other field grade officers. They all received sufficient travel expenses before leaving. In addition, more than 70 former Chiang's military officers and captains of a PLA officer corps in the military region voluntarily requested to join the People's Liberation Army and have now been approved for enlistment.

　　蒋匪军官丧失斗志
  　都不愿替蒋贼卖命
    【新华社陕北五日电】据广州迟到消息：失败情绪已在蒋军干部中蔓延，去年十月间一位从外地返抵广州的军官谈到山东战场时称：“前线国（蒋）军军事干部胆小如鼠”，“毫无斗志，连白崇禧的外甥海竞强（整编一百八十八旅旅长）那样骄横彪悍的人，都毫不抵抗就被俘了”。另一位在莱芜战役中负伤的四十六军军官说：“我不但对上面堂而皇之的‘剿匪’命令不感兴趣，而且对自己部队的战斗力失去信心，现在创痕未愈，又要出发，愿仗总理在天之灵，这次可要让我被俘而不要负伤。”另息：与蒋匪有关的沪“观察”杂志今年一月十日载一现正驻守平津保的“现役军人”的投函，亦透露出蒋军军官日益增长的厌战反战情绪。该函称：“……如今我自觉一切希望都幻灭了，我原因抗日而从军，但现在成了被利用作维护几个私人利益的工具，我的命运是被他人所注定的。青春、学业、父母、生命都将毫无意义的丧失，我现在懂得‘雷马克’（按：雷马克为德国一著名反战作家）的悲哀了！”
    【新华社晋察冀六日电】清风店战役被解放的蒋军第三军尉级军官一部，于一月二十八日参加解放军，受到当地军民热烈欢迎。他们经过两个多月的学习，深刻认识蒋匪介石的卖国罪行，并悔悟不该替蒋贼卖命打内战，纷纷申请参加解放军，杀敌立功。经批准者有原蒋军第三军三十二师九十六团迫击炮连上尉连长王佛印等五十六人。
    【新华社东北六日电】解放军辽东军区七个月来已释放被俘蒋军校尉级官佐一千五百余名（内有家属二十余名），其中包括前蒋军六十军暂二十一师三团中校副团长刘盛昌、八十四师中校军需主任何法昭、一一六师中校军需主任王烈三等校级军官十名。他们在临行前都领得了足够的路费。另该军区某解放军官团之前蒋军校尉级军官七十余名，自动要求参加解放军，现已获批准入伍。
