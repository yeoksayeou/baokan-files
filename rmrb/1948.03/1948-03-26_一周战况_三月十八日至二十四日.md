　　Weekly War Situation
　　March 18th to 24th

The powerful spring offensive of the People's Liberation Army continued to expand victoriously this week. After three months of reorganization and training during the winter, the East China People's Liberation Army launched a fierce offensive on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway on the 11th of this month, sweeping both sides of the Jiaoji Railway and directly threatening the enemy's nest, Jinan. On the morning of the 11th, a unit of our army first captured Zhangdian City, the connecting point of the Jiaoji Railway and the Zhangdian-Boshan branch line. Subsequently, it captured nine county towns including Boshan, Laiwu, Zichuan south of the Jiaoji Railway, and Linzi, Huantai, Changshan, Zouping, Qidong, and Zhangqiu north of the railway, as well as important towns along the railway such as Zhoucun, Jinling, Mashang, Wangcun, Pujicun, Mingshui, and Longshan. In total, it annihilated more than 24,000 enemy troops including the headquarters of the Kuomintang bandit's 32nd Division, the entire 141st Brigade, the headquarters of the New 36th Brigade and its 106th and 107th Regiments, and the 4th Regiment of the Zibo Garrison Brigade. After suffering this heavy blow, the bandit's nest in Jinan was in a state of panic, with large quantities of materials being transported south in a hurry, and the families of bandit officials scrambling to escape. Currently, our army's offensive is in full swing.

Simultaneous with the Jiaoji Railway offensive, the Subei Corps of the People's Liberation Army launched a strong offensive on the 16th in the area east of Lianghuai (Huaian, Huaiyin), between the Shu River, the Salt Transport River, the Liutang River, and the Sheyang River. On the 19th, Yilin, the first major commercial town in northern Jiangsu east of Lianghuai, was captured. Although the Kuomintang bandits stubbornly defended Shuigou and used poison gas three times, they were completely annihilated. Another unit of our army simultaneously intercepted enemy reinforcements from the 72nd Division, 44th Division, and 51st Division on the Funing-Huaian Highway, inflicting casualties and forcing them to flee back. The initial results of this battle included the complete annihilation of the 113th Brigade (missing the 339th Regiment) of the 51st Division, capturing over 4,000 enemy troops including the commander of the 113th Brigade, Wang Kuang, and killing or wounding over 2,000. Another unit of our army captured Shuyang County on the 6th and Funing City on the 11th. Our advancing People's Liberation Army in the Huainan area annihilated over 1,400 enemy troops between Hongze and Gaoyou Lakes from the 25th of last month to the 3rd of this month, capturing the towns of Tongcheng and Gucheng, and recovering the vast area between Xuyi and Tianchang. The local armed forces of the Huaibei people cooperated in the offensive, capturing Shangdianji, @ji, and Qingyang Town outside Sixian County from the 16th to the 18th, annihilating two enemy battalions and miscellaneous troops. On the 15th, our Central Jiangsu People's Liberation Army successively captured Juegang on the Rugao-Juegang line and Shigang northeast of Nantong, and intercepted the enemy reinforcements from Nantong, annihilating over 2,500 Kuomintang bandits. On the 17th, Sanyu Town, a famous cotton-producing area east of Nantong, was captured, completely annihilating the six security squadrons defending it. By this point, all liberated areas in Central China had been expanded and consolidated compared to before. In northern Jiangsu alone, Shuyang, Funing, and Yeting (Yancheng) three cities and the (Nan)tong-(Gan)yu Highway north to the outskirts of Guanyun City and south to the outskirts of Dongtai City, a 500-li section and its vast surrounding areas, are under control. Due to the new developments in the overall situation in East China, the Kuomintang bandit convened a "pacification" conference of seven provinces in Central China on the 20th in a panic to cope with the crisis, lamenting that they were "facing complete collapse."

After capturing Luoyang, the Yu-Shaan-E People's Liberation Army successively recovered four cities including Yuxian, Dengfeng, Yichuan, and Xiangcheng, with the defending enemy fleeing in disarray. While our army's Luoyang-attacking corps fiercely attacked Luoyang, another intercepting corps also completed its glorious mission. In the Yanshi and Dengfeng areas, they intercepted four brigades of Sun Yuanliang's corps and two brigades of Hu Lian's corps, annihilating over 1,400 enemy troops. By the night of the 14th, we had completely occupied Luoyang City, with stubborn enemies still being intercepted in the area south of Yanshi. In our army's liberation of Luoyang, a total of over 18,000 enemy troops, including the Youth Army 206th Division and miscellaneous troops, were completely annihilated, and the captured materials were enough to equip several brigades. After completing its strategic mission, our army proactively withdrew from Luoyang City on the morning of the 18th.

The powerful second-line corps of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, after completing rigorous military and political training, have now been enthusiastically sworn in and sent to the front lines, with warm send-offs from representatives of people's organizations from Heilongjiang, Mudanjiang, Nenjiang, Songjiang, and Hejiang. With this newly formed powerful people's armed force joining the front lines, the demise of the Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast will be accelerated. In the Jehol area, our army recovered Fuxin, an important coal production center, on the 18th, with the defending enemy fleeing towards Yixian, and our army pursuing and annihilating a portion of them.

　　一周战况
  　三月十八日至二十四日
    解放军强大的春季攻势作战本周仍继续胜利扩展中。华东解放军经冬季三个月的整训后，本月十一日即向胶济路西段展开猛烈攻势，席卷胶济两侧，直逼敌巢济南。十一日晨，我军一部首克胶济路与张（店）博（山）支路连接点张店市，续又先后攻克胶济路南的博山、莱芜、淄川，路北的临淄、桓台、长山、邹平、齐东、章邱等九座县城，及铁路上之重镇周村、金岭、马尚、王村、普集、明水、龙山等处。总计歼灭蒋匪整三十二师师部、一四一旅全部、新三十六旅旅部与所属一○六团、一○七团及淄博警备旅第四团等土杂共二万四千余名。蒋匪经此重击后，匪巢济南已呈慌乱，物资大批仓惶南运，匪官眷属争相逃命。目前我军攻势正方兴未艾。
    与胶济路攻势同时，解放军苏北兵团于十六日起在两淮（淮安、淮阴）以东、沭河、运盐河、六塘河及射阳河之间地区发起强大攻势。十九日攻占两淮以东之苏北第一商业重镇益林，蒋匪虽据守水沟顽抗，并三次施放毒气，仍被彻底歼灭。我军另部于同时在阜（宁）淮（安）公路上阻击援敌整七十二师、整四十四师、整五十一师等各一部，敌受创回窜。是役初步战果计歼敌五十一师一一三旅（缺三三九团）全部，生俘一一三旅旅长王匡以下四千余名，毙伤二千余名。另部我军于六日攻占沭阳县城，十一日攻克阜宁城。我挺进淮南地区解放军，自上月二十五日至本月三日在洪泽及高邮两湖之间地区歼敌一千四百余名，攻克铜城、古城两镇，收复盱眙天长间之广大地区。淮北人民地方武装配合攻势作战，十六日至十八日克泗水县城外之上店集，＠集及青阳镇，歼敌两营及土杂等。我苏中解放军十五日连克如（皋）掘（港）线之掘之及南通东北之石港，并阻击由南通出援之敌，先后歼灭蒋匪二千五百余名。十七日攻克南通东面著名产棉区三余镇，全歼守敌六个保安中队。至此我华中各解放区均较前扩大巩固，仅苏北即已控制沭阳、阜宁、叶挺（盐城）三城与（南）通（赣）榆公路北至灌云城郊，南至东台城郊一段五百余里，及其两侧广大地区。由于整个华东形势的新发展，蒋贼仓惶于二十日召开华中七省“绥靖”会议，应付危局，哀鸣“面临完全崩溃”。
    豫陕鄂解放军在攻克洛阳前后，相继收复禹县、登封、伊川、襄城等四城，守敌望风逃窜。当我军攻洛兵团猛攻洛阳同时，另部阻击兵团亦完成光辉任务。在偃师及登封地区阻击敌援兵孙元良兵团四个旅，胡琏兵团两个旅，并歼其一千四百余人。至十四日夜我已全部占领洛阳城，顽敌尚被阻击于偃师以南地区。我军解放洛阳之役，全歼守敌青年军二○六师及土杂共计一万八千余人，缴获物资足够装备若干个旅。我军于完成战略任务之后，已于十八日晨主动撤离洛阳城。
    东北解放军第二线强大兵团，于完成严格的军政训练后，现已纷纷誓师开赴前线，黑龙江、牡丹江、嫩江、松江、合江等各地人民团体代表发起热烈欢送。由于这一支新生的强大人民武装投入前线，将更加速东北蒋匪的灭亡。热东方面我军于十八日收复重要煤产中心的阜新，守敌向义县方面逃窜，我追歼其一部。
