　　Regardless of Local or Outsider Status
    Farmers Should Be of One Mind
  　Hope Wall Village Democratically Resolves Sectarian Conflicts
    [Taihang News] The working group in Wangbi Village, Second District of Licheng, promptly and democratically resolved sectarian issues among the poor and hired peasants while mobilizing and organizing them, enhancing everyone's awareness, eliminating sectarianism, and increasing the unity of the farmers. Originally, the Duan surname was prevalent in this village, and historically, there existed sectarianism between locals and outsiders. When the working group arrived in the village to mobilize and organize the poor and hired peasants, sectarianism flared up again among them due to the election of group leaders. After Wang Guinu and Zhu Xiaoping's group elected Feng Meixing's wife (an outsider) as their group leader, poor peasant Zhang Jinyuan and others were somewhat dissatisfied, fearing that outsiders would seize power and distribute more fruits. They said to others, "Who told you to elect Feng Meixing's wife as the group leader? Are there no people from our local families? Aren't we worth a pound, while outsiders are all worth a pound?" After the working group discovered this problem, they convened a conference of male and female poor and hired peasants on March 19th, encouraging everyone to share their thoughts, review the election, and discuss the issue of unity among the poor and hired peasants. At the beginning, everyone mentioned Jinyuan's sectarian behavior. Honest poor peasants like Duan You Shun and Shi Shuangxi said, "This time our election is all about choosing honest farmers, people who are upright and serve everyone. Poor people all over the world are one family, regardless of local or outsider status, we must unite together to completely eliminate feudalism! We should raise any opinions we have ourselves, we cannot engage in sectarianism, and even less can we let others laugh at us." After they both said this, Jinyuan himself made a self-criticism, saying, "In this election, I was afraid that outsiders would seize power; I myself am a poor person, and I look down on my poor brothers, this is my class consciousness is not clear." Then, immigrant Niu Guibao spoke, saying, "I am from Jiulong Mountain in the Sixth District, and I immigrated here. My poor friends treated me very well, lending me quilts, pots, bowls, millet, and firewood, all of which were prepared very well. We poor people are all one lump of flesh, and I very much agree with everyone's proposal not to divide families. Only by uniting can we all turn over!" After he spoke, Duan Cun, an old man, used his own suffering to speak to everyone like this: "Our village has many people with the Duan surname, and more than thirty households have already been struggled against. Although I also have the Duan surname, I am a poor person. In the past, when I borrowed money from them, they would see how much land I had, how much it was worth, before they would lend me any money. If the property wasn't enough to pay off the debt, they would exploit me even down to my flesh and blood. Even if we have the same family name, we must recognize our class. We poor people love poor people, regardless of Shanxi or Henan, farmers are originally one family." After the discussion, the poor and hired peasants throughout the village became even more united from then on.

　　不分本地外来户
    农民应该一条心
  　望壁民主解决宗派矛盾
    【太行消息】黎城二区望壁村工作组，在发动与组织贫雇中，及时民主解决贫雇间的宗派问题，提高大家觉悟消除宗派，增进了农民的团结。这个村原来姓段的多，过去历史上就存在着有本地与外来户的宗派；此次工作组到该村进行发动与组织贫雇时，因为选举组长的事，贫雇间又闹开宗派了。当王闺女和祝小平的小组选上冯美兴家（外来户）老婆当小组长后，贫农张进元等便有些不满，怕外来户掌了权多分果实，便向旁的人说：“谁叫你们选冯美兴老婆当小组长？咱本地户就没有人了，咱就不够一斤，外来户就都够一斤。”工作组发觉这个问题后，便在三月十九号召开男女贫雇大会，启发大家谈心思，检查选举，讨论贫雇团结的问题。一开始大家就提到了进元耍宗派的事，段有顺、石双喜等老实贫雇便说：“咱这次选举都是选老实农民，为人正派，给大家办事的人，咱们天下穷人是一家，不分本地和外来户，都要团结到一块，彻底来消灭封建！咱们自己有啥意见就提，不能闹宗派，更不能让别人看咱笑话”。他两人这样说了后，进元自己便作了检讨，他说：“我在这次选举中，害怕外来户掌了权；我自己是个穷人，又看不起咱穷弟兄，这是我阶级上不明确。”接着又有移民牛贵保发言，他说：“我是六区九龙山人，移民到咱们这里来，穷朋友们招待的很好，有借被子、锅碗、小米、柴都给准备的很好，咱们穷人都是一圪旦肉，大家提出不分家，这我很赞成，就是大家团结才能一齐翻身！”讲了后，接着就有段存老汉以自己的痛苦向大家这样讲：“咱村姓段的多，已斗了三十多户，我虽也姓段，可是个穷人，以前我借他们债，他还要看我有多少土地，能作多少价，才放给我多少钱，如果业不抵债，就连肉带血都把我剥削了。同家同姓也得认清阶级，咱穷人爱穷人，不分山西和河南，农民本来是一家。”讨论后，全村贫雇农从此更加团结。
