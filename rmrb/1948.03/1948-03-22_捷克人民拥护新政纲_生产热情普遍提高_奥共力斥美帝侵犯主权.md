    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 19th: Prague dispatch: The new democratic policy program proposed by the Czech government was unanimously passed by 230 members of parliament on the 12th. Its main contents are: continuing to implement the policy program of the National Front; implementing the decision of the February Workers' Congress to nationalize industries employing more than 50 people, and the decision of the Farmers' Congress on "land to the tillers"; and thoroughly carrying out the work of purging reactionaries. The passage of the new policy program has been warmly supported by the entire Czech people and has sparked a universal production upsurge. The movement to strive to complete this year's economic plan by October 28th, the 30th anniversary of Czech independence, is continuing to unfold. The trade union newspaper commented on the passage of the new policy program, saying: "No one can stop our people from moving towards socialism."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 18th: Vienna dispatch: The plenary session of the Austrian Communist Party Central Committee, held here on the 11th and 12th, discussed the country's political situation and approved the party's political line and current tasks. The resolution passed by the plenary session emphasized that the Communist Party's task is to strengthen the struggle to win freedom and Austrian sovereignty, to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, and to withdraw the occupying forces. The plenary session has put forward a policy contrary to the reactionary policy of the Figl-Schärf government, which is dragging Austria into the Marshall Plan state group, namely, to build the Austrian economy on the basis of self-reliance and cooperation with neighboring countries. The plenary session fully supported the working class's demands for a 25 percent wage increase and immediate improvement in food supply. In order to realize these demands, the plenary session called on all party members to strengthen the struggle to unite the working class. In the resolution on the peace treaty, the plenary session strongly condemned the following conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys: to further delay the Austrian peace treaty; to divide Austria and merge its western provinces with West Germany; to infringe upon Austria's sovereignty; and to undermine Austria's democratic freedom. The resolution strongly stated: The Austrian people demand a free, independent, and indivisible Austria, and look forward to the departure of the last foreign soldier and the last foreign control institution from Austria. The resolution finally called on the Austrian Communist Party to unite the working people and fight for freedom and independence.
