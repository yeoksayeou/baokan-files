　　Handan City Promotes Land Law During Spring Festival
  　Merchants and Middle Peasants Relieved of Worries
    [Handan News] When the Land Law was first disseminated to Handan City, some people became afraid. Some merchants feared being struggled against and wanted to take advantage of the year-end to settle accounts and close their businesses for a rest. Some middle peasants were worried all day long and became too lazy to work. In response to these situations, the Municipal Education Section convened a meeting of municipal propaganda and education cadres on the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month to study the issue. It was decided that the central task of the New Year's entertainment work would be to publicize the Land Law. First, a writing team was organized to create six short plays within four days, as well as songs and rhythmic patter. Cadres were assigned specific tasks to participate in and lead the work in various streets, and to help the masses compile their own materials.

    In the city's fifty or so streets and villages, except for a few villages such as Meng Wu Village in Sanlipu outside the East Gate, almost every street set up a stage to perform new plays. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than forty different types of performances, of which more than two-thirds were explanations and propaganda for the Land Law. Especially on the 15th and 16th days of the new year, during the day, the Yangko teams twisted, sang, and performed street plays. The roadsides, rooftops, and windows were crowded with spectators, and even cars could not drive through. In the evenings, each stage was packed with thousands of people, listening quietly, drawing crowds away from theaters performing old plays. Everywhere in the streets, people were talking about the Land Law.

    After several days of propaganda, most of the merchants and the middle peasants dispelled their worries, and the knots in their hearts were untied. Dong Qingrong, a basket weaver in Nanmenli, heard before the New Year about "equal distribution" and feared that his business would be confiscated. He sold off all his goods and sat at home, worrying all the time. After seeing the play "Merchants Rejoice," he realized that industry and commerce would not be struggled against, and he was relieved, using the money to buy goods and start working again. Old Kuanzi, who runs a flour mill in Jiaoyao Street, dared not work before, and lent his furniture to others. Now that he understands the policy, he wants his things back and plans to open his business again. Some middle peasants in Zhangzhuang Bridge are now competing to deliver manure and plant hemp, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Jin Dachun, a poor farmhand in the back street of Southwest Village, had not thoroughly turned himself over in the past and still lived in a dilapidated house. He used to hate attending meetings, but after watching the play, he perked up and said, "So the Land Law is meant to help us completely turn ourselves over! I feel happy now.”

　　邯郸市春节宣传土地法
  　商人中农去了心病
    【邯郸消息】土地法刚传到邯郸市的时候，有些人害怕起来，有的商人怕斗，想趁着年底结帐关门歇业，有的中农整天愁眉苦脸，活也懒得干。根据这些情况，市教育科于旧历腊月二十四日召开市宣教干部会议研究，决定在年关文娱工作以宣传土地法为中心任务，首先组织创作组，在四天中突击写成六个短剧，还有歌曲、快板，干部具体分工分头到各街参加领导，并帮助群众自编材料。
    全市五十来个街村，排演新戏的除了东门外三里铺孟仵村等几个村子外，差不多街头都搭着台子出演新剧节目，据不完全的统计有四十多种，其中三分之二以上都是土地法的宣传解释，特别是十五、十六几天，白天秧歌队扭、唱、演街头剧，马路上楼顶上楼窗口都挤满了观众，连汽车都不能开驶。晚上各街台下，都拥着几千群众，静静的听，把几个演旧戏的园子都扯没了人，街上到处都在谈论土地法上的事。
    经过几天的宣传，商民、中农大部分都打消了顾虑，心里的圪瘩解开了。南门里手工业笼铺董庆荣，年前听说“平分”怕买卖归了公，把货物都折卖净光，坐在家里光发愁，看了演商人乐，才知道不斗工商业，才放了心又把钱买成货干起来。焦窑街开粉坊的老宽子，以前不敢干，把家具都借给人家，现在明白了政策，把东西要回来，又打算开门。张庄桥有些中农现在都争着送粪点麻子，生产劲头大了起来。西南庄后街贫雇金大春，过去没有翻透身，还住着破房子，一听开会就讨厌，看了演戏后，提起劲头说：“原来土地法是要咱翻透身啦！心里高兴起来。
