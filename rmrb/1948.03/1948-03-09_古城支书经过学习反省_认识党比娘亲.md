　　Ancient City Branch Secretary, After Study and Reflection, Realizes the Party is Closer Than Mother
    [Taihang News] Liu Kechao (poor peasant/hired hand), village chief of Xiniu Village in the 10th District of Lin County, and Comrade Liu Dongjin, branch secretary of Gucheng Village in the 11th District, after studying the "Land Law" and the "Letter to Party Members," reflected and examined their ideas of forgetting their roots. They resolved to correct their mistakes, do a good job in their current work, and be good long-term workers for the people. Comrade Liu Kechao, on his way back from a meeting in the district, told the cadres: "This time, I must seriously examine myself and be determined to do things well for my poor brothers." Back in the village, he examined himself this way: In the past, I only said that our village was backward in terms of poor peasants and hired hands, but I never thought that the route we took in the past was wrong, and we didn't really solve the difficulties for the poor peasants and hired hands. Comrade Liu Dongjin said at the cadre meeting that his mother had stored 200 catties of grain, two mattresses, two dou of ground grain, a broken jar, and a porcelain cat with the landlord Yue Xiujun. He didn't dare to say it before, but after thinking it through, he said painfully: He didn't want to say it because he was afraid of losing his mother's reputation. After this study, he felt that the Party was closer than his mother, and he could no longer harm the interests of the masses and deceive the Party and the people for his mother's sake. Under the influence of Comrade Liu at the meeting, other cadres also automatically unloaded their burdens and examined their mistakes.

　　古城支书经过学习反省
  　认识党比娘亲
    【太行消息】林县十区西牛村村长刘克朝（贫雇），十一区古城村支部书记刘董金同志，学习“土地法”及“告党员书”后，反省检讨忘本思想，决心改正自己错误，作好当前工作，为人民当个好长工。刘克朝同志在区上开会回来，路上给干部们说：“这次回去可要好好检讨一下，下决心为穷兄弟把事办好。”回村就这样检讨：以前光说咱村贫雇落后，就没有想到过去咱走的路线不对，没有真正给贫雇解决了困难。刘董金同志在干部会上谈出：他母亲给地主岳秀俊存放的谷子二百斤，褥子两条，谷面二斗，破缸一个，磁猫一个。以前他不敢说，现在想通后他沉痛的说：不愿说是怕丢了母亲的人。经过这次学习，他感到党比娘亲，不能再为母亲的面子去危害群众利益，瞒哄党和人民了。会上在刘同志的影响下，其他干部亦都自动卸放自己的包袱，检讨自己的错误。
