Taihang Third District Finance and Grain Section on the Discrepancy in Rice Dispute
　　Self-Criticism of Sloppy Work Style

To the Editors:

　　After reading Comrade Chen Hong's "Whether Workers Were Overcharged for Rice for Official Use" on February 1st and Comrade Gai Liangbi of the Huguan County Government's explanation on February 20th, "No Overcharge for Workers' Rice for Official Use," we feel that the point of contention between Comrades Chen and Gai lies in the order from the Third District Office. Comrade Chen Hong stated: "We implemented the order from the Third District Office, but the workers' native villages did not." Gai Liangbi replied, "We did not receive a formal order from the Administrative Office or the District Office in December of last year." This is related to the Third District Office's (Finance and Grain Section) lack of thoroughness in its work style. We should bear some responsibility for the dispute between the two comrades. Now, we will explain why the Third District Office did not issue orders to each county to clarify the situation.

　　The decision to collect rice for official use from workers starting in November was made at the meeting of the heads of the finance and grain sections of each county on November 8th of last year. Fan Chongli (head of the Finance and Grain Section) attended from Huguan. After the meeting, he devoted all his efforts to transporting grain, and the rice for official use could not be collected in a timely manner. The District Office (directly collecting from larger factories) and Changzhi City began collecting in late December. Letters were sent to each county with the aim of urging the implementation of the resolution to ensure uniformity throughout the district. The decision made at the finance and grain meeting was that a formal order should be issued after the meeting for implementation. However, due to the prevailing thought that since it was a decision made at the meeting, it was not necessary to issue another order, no order was issued to each county. During the collection process, most cadres participated in land reform meetings, and the above decision was not understood by comrades who persisted in their work (such as Gai Liangbi), resulting in inconsistencies in implementation and causing many problems.

　　When the District Office began collecting, it issued a notice to the factories being collected from, stating "Pay Rice for Official Use for November and December" (which is the order from the Third District mentioned by Comrade Chen Hong). The original plan was for the District Office to collect from the Yongsheng Porcelain Factory, but the notice was changed to collection by the Municipal Government, so the factory received two notices (from the District and Municipal governments). Originally, this notice should have been made known to each county, but at the time, we thought it was not very relevant to each county, so we were sloppy and did not notify each county, resulting in this dispute and the phenomenon of double burden.

　　When Gai Liangbi sent someone to ask the District Office whether such an order had been issued, some cadres were participating in the Party rectification meeting, and the comrades in the section who persisted in their work did not understand the decision. An examination of the files and dispatch books showed that no such order had been issued, so the issue in dispute was not clarified.

　　In short, Comrade Chen Hong's basis for raising the question is that "the District Office issued orders to factories, and each county must have also done the same," and we believe that this basis is reasonable. Comrade Gai Liangbi's reply, made without knowing of this decision and without seeing a formal order, is not entirely incorrect. The fault of the "order" itself lies with us.

　　太行三专财粮科关于差米争论
  　检讨自己作风马虎编辑同志：
    读二月一日陈虹同志所提“是否多收了工人的支差米”及二月二十日壶关县政府盖良弼同志说明“没有多收工人差米”两文后，觉到陈盖两同志的争论点则是三专署的命令问题。陈虹同志提出：“我们执行了三专署命令，而工人原籍各村并未执行。”盖良弼答复“去年十二月份我们并未接到行署和专署的正式命令”，这与专署（财粮科）作风不深入有关系。两同志的争执，我们应负一定责任。现将三专署为什么没有给各县下命令说明如下，以明真相。
    从十一月起征收工人支差米，是去年十一月八日各县财粮科长会议上的决定。壶关是范崇礼（财粮科长）参加的，会后全力运粮，差米未能及时征收。十二月下旬专署（直接征收较大工厂）和长治市开始征收。发给各县便信，目的是督促执行决议，使之于全专区统一。财粮会议决定应于会后发正式命令便予执行，因存在着既是会议决定不需要再发命令的思想，便没有给各县下命令。在征收中，大部干部参加了土改会议，上项决定未能使坚持工作的（如盖良弼）同志所了解，造成执行上不一致，发生了不少问题。
    专署开始征收时，给被征收之工厂发有“交纳十一十二月份差米”的通知（就是陈虹同志说三专的命令）。永生磁厂原定专署征收，发通知的又改为市政府征收，因此该厂接到（专市）两份通知。本来这个通知应让各县了解，而我们当时认为与各县关系不大，便马虎了事，未曾通知各县，以致发生此次争论及两头负担的现象。
    盖良弼派人来问专署是否发过这样的命令时，部分干部参加了整党会议，科内坚持工作的同志对决定也不了解，检查卷宗与发文簿并未发过这样的命令，因此所争之问题仍未搞通。
    总之陈虹同志提问题的根据是“专署给工厂发命令各县一定同样有”，我们认为这个根据是合乎道理的。盖良弼同志在不知有这个决议，又未见到正式命令的情况下，作的答复并非完全不对，“命令”本身的错处，是在我们身上。（太行三专财粮科三月九日）
