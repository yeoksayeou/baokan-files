Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive forces have advanced deep into the Yellow Dragon Mountain area on the southern line of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, achieving an unprecedented and massive victory. At 5:00 PM on the 1st, the People's Liberation Army, in an area 20 li southwest of Yichuan, completely and cleanly annihilated the Hu bandit 29th Army Headquarters, the Chiang-Hu bandit's elite main force 90th Reorganized Division, the 27th Reorganized Division Headquarters, and four full brigades. Detailed battle results are still being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: The Northwest People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the Hu Zongnan's main force 29th Reorganized Army Headquarters and its affiliated two reorganized divisions near Yichuan, Northern Shaanxi, on March 1st, achieving a glorious victory. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a special telegram of congratulations on March 2nd. The original telegram is as follows: Comrades Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zongxun, and Zhao Shoushan, and through you to all commanders and fighters of the Northwest People's Liberation Army: We celebrate your great victory in the southern line offensive, completely annihilating the Hu enemy's 29th Reorganized Army Headquarters and the 27th Reorganized Division, and the 90th Reorganized Division. We hope you will continue your efforts and fight for the liberation of the Great Northwest! The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. March 2, 1948.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: The Chiang-Hu bandit gang in Shaanxi is terrified under the mighty victories of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts. In early October of last year, the Hu bandits had already moved the Pacification Headquarters (i.e., the Commander's Office), which had been located near the Small Wild Goose Pagoda south of Xi'an for nearly ten years, and its various warehouses and granaries in the suburbs into the city. Zhu Shaohzou announced at the provincial government's memorial week that every civil servant should prepare three months' worth of food for a last-ditch struggle. The Hu bandits are also forcing the people of more than ten counties around Xi'an to dig a moat around the city and build fortifications and pillboxes within 20 li of the city. The first line of defense trenches, 5 li from the city, has now been completed. The second and third lines will soon be built. Xingping, Jingyang, Fengxiang, and other counties are also forcing the entire county's manpower to dig trenches around the county towns, attempting to surround the cities with water. Obstacles have been built on every street and alley in Baoji, and a martial law command has been established. The north and west gates of Qian County have been frequently closed since autumn, and pillboxes have also been built next to the pseudo-county magistrate's residence.

    【新华社西北二日电】解放军反攻大军长驱挺入陕甘宁边区南线黄龙山地区，获得空前的巨大胜利。一日下午五时，解放军在宜川西南二十里地区，彻底干净全部歼灭将胡匪第二十九军军部、蒋胡匪精锐主力整九十师、整二十七师两个师部以及四个整旅，详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社陕北三日电】西北人民解放军于三月一日在陕北宜川附近全部歼灭胡宗南主力整编第二十九军军部及其所属两个整编师，取得辉煌胜利。中共中央委员会于三月二日特驰电祝捷，原电如下：彭德怀、张宗逊、赵寿山同志并转西北人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员同志们：庆祝你们南线进攻，全歼胡敌整编二十九军军部及整编二十七师，整编九十师的伟大胜利。尚望继续努力，为解放大西北而战！中共中央委员会。一九四八年三月二日。
    【新华社西北三日电】陕西蒋胡匪帮在各路解放军胜利的威震下，惊恐万分。去年十月初胡匪已将设于西安城南小雁塔近十年的绥靖公署（即长官部）及其城郊各种仓库、粮库搬入城内。祝绍周在省政府纪念周上曾宣布每个公务员要准备三个月粮食，以作困兽之斗。胡匪并强迫西安周围十余县人民赶挖环城河，在城周围二十里内大修工事碉堡，距城五里之第一道防御壕，现已竣工。第二、三道即将动工兴修。兴平、泾阳、凤翔等县也强逼全县人力在各县城周围掘壕，企图以水环城。宝鸡城内大街小巷皆已修筑障碍物，并设戒严司令部。干县北西两门入秋后经常紧闭，伪县长住宅旁也修了碉楼。
