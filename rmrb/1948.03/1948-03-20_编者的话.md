　　Editor's Note
    According to news from villages such as Dachi and Hongtijguan, conditions for joining the group or association were proposed when the Poor Peasants' League and the New Farmers' Association were established, such as "four wants and three don'ts." We feel that it is good that the masses in various places can pay attention to the purity of their organizations from the beginning. However, it is worth noting that these should not develop into restrictions on poor and hired peasants participating in their own organizations, such as not allowing poor and hired peasants to join the group or association, thus creating a closed-door tendency.

　　编者的话
    据大池、虹梯关等村消息看，在成立贫农团和新农会时，都提了入团入会的条件，如四要三不要等，我们感到各地群众一开始能注意自己组织内部的纯洁，这是好的，但值得注意的是这些不应发展成为贫雇农参加自己组织的限制，不叫贫雇入团入会，造成关门主义倾向。
