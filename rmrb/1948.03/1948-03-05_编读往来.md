　　Reader-Editor Interactions
　　The "Everywhere Ignite Fires to Mobilize the Masses" Method Should Not Be Abused
    To the Editor:
    The news item on the front page of the February 28th newspaper about a certain column "everywhere igniting fires to mobilize the masses" made me feel that this method of mobilizing the masses is inconsistent with the recent instruction from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: that land reform work is a very meticulous mass work, and should not be rushed, causing many unnecessary problems. It is very obvious that this method should no longer be used in old and semi-old areas. If it is not suitable for new areas either, I think it is problematic for the newspaper to adopt this news.
　　Li Fang
  　Comrade Li Fang’s suggestion is very good. The so-called "everywhere ignite fires to mobilize the masses" method emphasizes speed, and it is extremely easy to lead to formalism, superficiality, and lack of depth. The work of mobilizing and organizing the masses is often insufficient. It should no longer be used in old and semi-old areas, and it is also not good to use this method in new areas. It is wrong for the newspaper to adopt this news without criticism.
  　Two Points
    To the Editor:
    I have two small points regarding the report on Zhao Zhuang’s work experience published on the second page of the February 29th issue:
    (1) The report mentions in three or four places, "…small Party members…" doing this and that. This may be the phrasing used by the masses, but even so, I feel that it should be explained to the masses that Party members are only differentiated by the weight of their work tasks, and are politically equal, and that Party members themselves are not differentiated by rank. Therefore, I feel that the Party newspaper should not promote this, as it makes people feel that Party members are divided into different ranks, which is inappropriate.
    (2) The report writes in one place "…Chairman Mao's New Year's Day speech"; and in another place "…Chairman Mao's New Year's Day report". I think this may refer to Chairman Mao's report at the CCP Central Committee meeting on December 25, 1947, namely "The Current Situation and Our Tasks". The report wrote it as "New Year's Day speech" and "New Year's Day report", which I think is somewhat confusing and unclear, making it difficult to understand, and is also inappropriate.
　　Zhao Li
    Comrade Zhao Li's two points are very correct. This is our editorial oversight, and we should strive to be careful and meticulous in the future to avoid similar problems. At the same time, we hope that Comrade Zhao Li and the vast number of readers will point out any errors in the newspaper news in the future, or raise questions about certain issues, for joint discussion.
　　The Newspaper Needs to Rely on the Broad Masses to Do Reporting Work
    To the Editor:
    I recently saw that the front page of the People's Daily published a lot of news from Wu'an County. According to our understanding, the biases and errors that have occurred in our liberated areas are not limited to Wu'an County, but also exist in other counties. I hope that our People's Daily can be used as a weapon to promote the work of the liberated areas, applied to every corner of the entire border area, and promote the completion of the great historical tasks of land reform and reorganization of the Party's ranks in various places. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses, not just limit ourselves to correspondents and a few reporters to report and reflect the true situation of the work in the entire liberated area, that is, we must rely on the vast number of readers to supervise the work in every corner of the entire area, promote the good, and criticize the bad.

　　编读往来
　　“到处点火发动群众”方式不可滥用编辑同志：
    二月二十八日报纸第一版所登某纵队“到处点火发动群众”，我感到这种发动群众方式与中共中央最近指示：土改工作是很细致的群众工作，不可操之过急，致发生许多不应有的毛病的精神不符，这种方式，在老区与半老区不可再用是很明显的了，如在新区也不适合的话，我想：报纸采用这个新闻恐怕是有毛病的。
　　李方
  　李方同志所提很好，所谓“到处点火发动群众”的方式，是强调快，极容易发生形式主义，表面，不深入，发动与组织群众的工作往往不够，在老区与半老区不可再用，即在新区运用这个方式也是不好的。报纸采用这个新闻，而未加批判是不对的。
  　两点意见编辑同志：
    读二月二十九号二版所载关于赵庄工作经验的报导中，有两点小意见：
    （一）该报导中有三四处提到：“……小党员……”如何如何。这可能是群众的提法，即如此，我觉得也应该向群众解释：党员只有工作任务轻重之分，政治权利上，一律平等，而党员本身并没有大小之别。因此，我觉得党报照样这样宣传，使人觉得党员还有大小等级之分，是不妥当的。
    （二）该报导有一处写着“……毛主席元旦讲话”；又有一处写着“……毛主席元旦报告”。我想这可能指的是毛主席一九四七年十二月二十五日在中共中央会议上的报告，即“目前形势和我们的任务”。该报导把它写成“元旦讲话”、“元旦报告”，我觉得有些混乱不清，使人摸不住头绪，也同样是不妥当的。
　　赵力
    赵力同志指出的两点很对，这是我们编辑上的疏忽，今后应力求谨慎细致，以免再出类似的毛病。同时希望赵力同志以及广大读者，以后凡看到报纸新闻有了错误，或者对某些问题有疑问，即加指正提出，以共同商讨。
　　报纸要靠广大群众来作报导工作编辑同志：
    我最近看人民日报一版登了不少武安县的消息，据我们了解咱解放区发生偏向、错误，不光是武安县，其他县也是同样有的。希望能把咱人民日报作为推动解放区工作的武器，运用到全边区的各个角落，推动各地来完成有历史性的土地改革及整编党的队伍的伟大任务。所以，那就必须发动广大群众，不只是限于通讯员和少数记者来报导和反映全解放区的工作真实情况，也就是必须靠广大读者群众来互相监督全区每一角落的工作，发扬好的，批评坏的。
