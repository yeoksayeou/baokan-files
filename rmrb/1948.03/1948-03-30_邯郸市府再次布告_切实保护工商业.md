　　Handan Municipal Government Issues Another Proclamation
　　Resolutely Protect Industry and Commerce

　　[Handan News] Some merchants in Handan still have some doubts about our policy of protecting industry and commerce to prosper the economy. They have not fully understood the important significance of developing industry and commerce, and hold a wait-and-see, conservative attitude in their business, and dare not let go and expand. In order to eliminate this doubt, the Municipal Government specially announced the following matters again on March 20th: 1. Resolutely protect the legitimate property and business freedom of industrialists and businessmen, and no one shall infringe upon them. Violators will be punished. 2. Shops and factories under the trusteeship of this government shall be returned to their original owners for free operation. It is hoped that the owners will go to the Industry and Commerce Administration Bureau to declare and collect them at any time. 3. Whether individuals or groups, those who have disputes with factories and shops and cannot resolve them on their own are allowed to go to the Municipal Government to resolve them according to law, and shall not privately take illegal measures such as sealing up, confiscation, fines, sales, and "struggle sessions" to detain people (except for criminals caught in the act). Violators shall be given appropriate punishment. 4. Labor-capital relations and owner-partner relations in industry and commerce should be based on the principles of developing business, prospering the economy, and cooperation for mutual benefit. Contracts should be signed and jointly observed through equal consultation between labor and capital (neither party shall force the other), so as to ensure that factory owners and shop owners are profitable, and the lives of workers and shop assistants are effectively guaranteed. Industrial and commercial owners shall not close factories or stop business without reason, and shall not dismiss or abuse workers and shop assistants without reason; workers and shop assistants shall also abide by the work system, be loyal to their duties, improve work efficiency, and ensure production. 5. During the land reform period, shops, factories, and workshops that privately hide the property of landlords and serve as landlords' "air-raid shelters" should immediately report to the government and hand over all the hidden property, so as to distinguish between right and wrong and effectively protect legitimate private business. Those who report themselves before April 30 will not be held accountable for the past. Those who are found out after the deadline will be severely punished according to law and will never be tolerated. (Xiao Fang)
