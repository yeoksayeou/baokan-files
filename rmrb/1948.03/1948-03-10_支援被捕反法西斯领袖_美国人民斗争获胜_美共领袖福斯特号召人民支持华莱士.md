　　Supporting Arrested Anti-Fascist Leaders
　　American People Win Struggle
　　American Communist Leader Foster Calls on People to Support Wallace
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th] New York dispatch: The American people have launched a demonstration movement to support arrested anti-fascists and have won an initial victory. Foster, Chairman of the Central Committee of the American Communist Party, issued a statement to the press on the 3rd, supporting the detained anti-fascists and calling on the broad masses of the people to support the hunger strikers against fascism and their demands for release. Delegations from trade unions and other progressive groups in Detroit and Philadelphia also issued the same demands on the same day. Fifty trade unions affiliated with the CIO unanimously demanded that Attorney General Clark dissolve the concentration camps on Ellis Island and release the imprisoned anti-fascists. The "Bill of Rights Congress" also issued a statement to the press stating that branches of the Congress had established permanent picket lines in front of the national headquarters of the Immigration Bureau in Philadelphia and in front of the Immigration Bureau in Chicago and other places, demanding the release of the hunger strikers. Members of the Congress also demonstrated in front of the Department of Justice. Due to the pressure of the broad masses of the people and the heroic hunger strike of the arrested, the reactionary American authorities have been forced to allow Boda Sbao, a member of the Central Committee of the American Communist Party and leader of the Fur Workers Union, to be released on bail. The hunger strike of the other four anti-fascist leaders has persisted for four days.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th] New York dispatch: The American Third Party movement continues to win support from all sides. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, called on American "liberals to turn in the direction of the new party organized by Wallace" in a speech in Philadelphia the other day. British playwright George Bernard Shaw, who lives in the United States, also sent a letter to the Wallace election campaign committee, praising Wallace as "the mouthpiece of Americans who truly do not want war." Wallace recently condemned the Marshall Plan at a mass meeting convened by iron ore workers in Minnesota for sacrificing American taxpayers' money to help steel monopolists. They sell their products abroad at twice the domestic price, "robbing the European people." Wallace also attacked the so-called liberal myth of former Minnesota Governor Stassen. According to the reactionary New York Herald Tribune, Wallace's speech "clearly moved many voters."
　　On the other hand, Truman's reputation within the Labor and Democratic parties is at an all-time low. According to American broadcasting commentator Alan, Washington is rumored that Democratic Party leaders, recognizing that Truman cannot win the election, are now planning to abandon Truman.

　　支援被捕反法西斯领袖
  　美国人民斗争获胜
    美共领袖福斯特号召人民支持华莱士
    【新华社陕北七日电】纽约讯：美国人民展开支援被捕反法西斯人士之示威运动，并赢得初步胜利。美共中央委员会主席福斯特三日向报界发表声明，支援被拘禁的反法西斯人士，号召广大人民支援反法西斯的绝食斗争者与他们的出狱要求。底特律与费城各职工会及其他进步团体的代表团，同日亦发出同样要求。产联所属五十个职工会，一致要求司法部长克拉克解散艾里斯岛的集中营，释放被囚的反法西斯人士。“人权保障大会”亦向报界发表声明称：大会各分会已在费城移民局全国总部门前及芝加哥等地移民局门前建立永久的纠察线，要求释放绝食斗争者。该会会员并在司法部门前示威。由于广大人民的压力及被捕者英勇的绝食斗争，美反动当局已被迫允许美共中委兼毛皮工会领袖鲍达斯保释出狱。其他四名反法西斯领袖的绝食斗争，已坚持至第四天。
    【新华社陕北七日电】纽约讯：美第三党运动继续赢得各方的支持。美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特，日前在费城演说时，号召美国“自由派应转向华莱士所组织的新党方向走”。寓居美国的英国名戏剧家萧伯纳，亦致函华莱士选举运动委员会，称誉华氏为“真正不愿战争的美国人的喉舌”。华氏最近在明尼苏达州铁矿工人召开的群众大会上，谴责马歇尔计划以牺牲美国纳税人的金钱，来帮助钢业独占家。他们以双倍于国内的价格向外推售其产品，“抢劫欧洲人民”。华氏又攻击前明尼苏达州州长史塔生的所谓自由主义神话。据反动的纽约先驱论坛报称：华氏演说“显然感动了许多选民”。
    另一方面，杜鲁门在劳工与民主党内的声誉正空前低落。据美国广播评论员亚伦称：华盛顿正盛传民主党党魁由于认识杜鲁门不能在竞选中赢得胜利，现正计划抛弃杜鲁门。
