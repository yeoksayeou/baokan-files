I Respect the American Communist Party and Love the American People
    By Eisler, translated by Ding Ming

　　In my long wandering as a German anti-fascist exile, I have found that the attitude towards genuine anti-fascist exiles is a barometer of a country's political climate. Whenever the rulers of a country turn to reaction and war propaganda, whenever more reactionary groups with fascist ideas seize greater power and try to politically crush the working class and all progressive forces, we anti-fascist exiles have to endure some suffering. Our existence is often used to cover up the true intentions of the reactionaries and to divert people's attention from their real problems.

　　I wish I were in Berlin, Leipzig or other German cities right now. If I were in Germany, I would ask to join the German Socialist Unity Party (formed by the merger of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party – translator) – the great hope of the German workers and German democracy, which is resolutely opposed by the official policies of Western countries and their German agents. I will write articles, teach and do whatever I am asked to do.

　　For me, there is really no need to shout excitedly. I have not raised prices, nor have I lowered wages. My leaving the United States will not harm the American people in any way. (The U.S. reactionary authorities forbade Eisler from returning to Germany the year before last, and now they want to deport him – translator.) On the contrary, Germany needs every anti-fascist to strive for a peaceful, anti-fascist, democratic Germany – a Germany that will no longer bring reaction, aggression, and massacres to the people of other countries.

　　If anyone thinks that I am prepared to play the role of a hare chased by the hounds of the reactionaries, then he is wrong. The history of every nation, especially the history of the German people, teaches us a very clear basic lesson: never be intimidated by the reactionaries; never be afraid, and be prepared to deal with provocateurs and swindlers who engage in their dirty tricks at any time and any place. Fight back at any time and any place. This is true for all nations, all classes and all individuals; it is also true for trade unions, progressive groups and progressive political parties; and it is no exception for minorities in race and religion.

　　Let me remind you on this issue: the Nazi dictatorship was actually the Committee against so-called "un-German activities" developed to the highest degree. It assassinated and massacred millions of noble Germans and people of various countries because they did not think and act according to Nazi standards, and this was "un-German activity." Can't you hear in the United States: someone wants to punish everyone in the world who does not comply with the standards and ideas of your Committee on Un-American Activities?

　　As long as I am forced to live in the United States, as long as I can use my pen, and as long as I am not forbidden to speak, I will fight back. And I will take every opportunity to fight back, and I am grateful for every opportunity given to me. Frankly, I think the free and progressive forces in the United States will give me more opportunities to fight back.

　　In my life, I have stayed in many countries, either as a German Communist reporter before Hitler came to power, or as a political exile after Hitler came to power. But wherever I went, my activities were only related to the struggle against German reactionaries, fascism and its international branches, and to the work of mobilizing all possible assistance to support the German underground struggle.

　　During my stay in the United States, I considered it my responsibility to do my best to support the war efforts of the United States and its allies against the German fascists and Japanese imperialism.

　　If I mention these activities, it is by no means because I want to boast about the little work I have done, but because I have to explain my activities. I have donated blood to the blood bank, and I have received certificates and medals for my loyalty to the duty of air defense warden. As a journalist, I used my pen to support the Allied cause, advocate Allied unity, and especially oppose the toxic ideas and confusion spread by members of the German-American Association (a Nazi organization in the United States – translator) and other American Nazi lovers among Americans of German origin in their ancestral Germany. In this regard, I must admit: I have written articles against Ms. Thompson when she advocated making peace with Germany and said that it would be better to fight the Soviet Union.

　　I also provided Communist reporters (such as my friend Starobin, the excellent international editor of the newspaper "Daily Worker") with my opinions and information on German and European issues, and he published these articles under the pen name "Hans Bergier" that he came up with. As a conscious journalist and commentator, my friend Starobin did not use his own name for things that were not entirely written by himself. Many journalists can learn something from his loyalty to his profession.

　　In "German-Americans," at the invitation of the late Rosenfeld, I wrote special articles, some signed and some unsigned. I also co-authored with two other German friends a book called "The Lessons of Germany," a book describing the art of assassination by German reactionaries and Nazis. I sincerely hope that I will never need to write a similar book: "The Lessons of America."

　　During my stay in the United States, I loved the American people very much.

　　If there is anything in what Budenz (a traitor to the American Communist Party who joined American Catholicism after his defection and engaged in shameless slander) said that is not false, it is that he unconsciously admitted that I wrote articles advocating fighting on the side of the United States and the Allies; I am a person who firmly believes that big countries need to be united. I honestly believe that this has something to do with this accusation (that is, saying that Eisler is a German spy, a representative sent by the Communist International to the United States to guide the American Communist Party, etc. – translator). I wrote articles against the evil philosophy that massacred millions of people, and this philosophy prompted Mr. Rankin (a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, a member of the Committee on Un-American Activities, and a reactionary leader who is anti-communist and anti-democratic) to conduct so-called investigations. I have only contempt for this philosophy in my life.

　　Obviously, if my articles supported the Nazis, I would be seen as a noble figure by Hearst's newspapers (an American newspaper trust, one of the propaganda machines that is anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-democratic) other publications, and Rankin's committee. If I came out like Ms. Thompson to advocate making peace with Hitler's Germany, and shed a tear of sympathy with Senator Taft and Ms. Thompson (a reactionary columnist for the New York Herald Tribune – translator) for the war criminals who were hanged, I think I would have received very different treatment. Ms. Thompson might have invited me to her humanitarian conference instead of expressing her hope to see me in prison.

　　If I thought that the future of China lay in the massacre of hundreds and thousands of peasants and workers, no one would accuse me of un-American activities. If I slander Tito, the people of Yugoslavia and Albania, I will be considered a very respectable person. If I love Franco (the Spanish dictator), Sien would love me as much as he loves Budenz. If I made some war propaganda against the Soviet Union because it has the most advanced social organization form, I would probably be allowed to re-educate German youth in West Germany with what is shamelessly called "the true spirit of democracy."

　　What is my relationship with the American Communist Party? Did I, a German anti-fascist exile, really give orders to the American Communist Party? Did they receive orders? No, I did not direct the American Communist Party. If I did, they would think I was crazy.

　　I know that everything in your country is great, and obviously the stupidity of your country's special agents, provocateurs, and some people who believe these guys is also great.

　　I respect the American Communist Party for their struggle against the reactionaries and for striving for peace and unity in this struggle.

　　I have seen American Communists and progressives fighting in the immortal International Brigades against Franco, Hitler, and Mussolini. What I had only learned from books in the past, I now know from life, that is, how bravely Americans can fight for a good cause. Among the American heroes who fought in Spain, there are no people like Rankin.

　　As a German anti-fascist, I am pleased with the American Communist Party's position on German issues, which is the position of many far-sighted Americans. As a German anti-fascist, I join the ranks of those Americans who sharply criticize the occupation policies of Western countries. General McNarney, the U.S. military governor in Germany (now General Clay, a reactionary agent of Wall Street), once said: The era of hating Germany is over. How beautifully said! However, this era should not be replaced by the era of loving German reactionaries.

　　I have only one wish, to return to my motherland to share the suffering of my compatriots, and to fight together with those who are seeking a happy and well-fed life for the German people.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　Translator's note: The author of this article was interrogated by the reactionary Committee on Un-American Activities in the United States the year before last and falsely accused of being a German spy. He was not allowed to return to his native Germany to engage in democratic struggle. He is currently imprisoned on Ellis Island near New York, preparing to be deported from the United States, and contrary to usual practice, he is not allowed to be released on bail before the trial. After a resolute hunger strike and the protests of the broad masses of the people, he and the American Communist leader Williamson (Labor Secretary) were released on bail on March 7.

　　The original article was published in the American New Masses magazine on December 17, 1946, and the title was added by the translator. The full text is very long, and this is an excerpt.

### 我尊敬美国共产党并爱美国人民

　　我尊敬美国共产党并爱美国人民
    艾斯勒作  丁名译
    在我作为德国反法西斯流亡者的长期流浪过程中，我已发现对于真正反法西斯流亡者的态度，是一个国家政治气氛的寒暑表。每当一个国家统治者的路线转向于反动和进行战争宣传，每当更加反动的具有法西斯思想的集团攫取更大的势力，并力图在政治上粉碎工人阶级与一切进步力量时，我们反法西斯流亡者便得经受一些苦难。我们的存在常常被利用来掩盖反动派的真正企图和使人民不注意他们的真正问题。
    我要是目前在柏林、莱比锡或德国其他城镇就好了。假如我在德国，我会要求参加德国社会统一党（共产党与社会党合并而成——译者）——德国工人和德国民主的伟大希望，西方各国官方政策和它们的德国代理人坚决反对它。我将写文章、教书并做任何叫我作的事。
    对于我，实在没有叫嚣激动的必要。我没有抬高物价，也没有减低工资，我离开美国不会对美国人有什么害处。（美反动当局前年曾禁止艾斯勒回德国，目前则又要将他驱逐出境——译者。）相反的，德国需要每一个反法西斯分子去争取和平的、反法西斯的、民主的德国——再不会给他国人民带来反动、侵略、大屠杀的德国。
    如果谁认为我准备扮演反动派猎犬所追逐的野兔的角色，那他就错了。每国人民的历史，特别是德国人民的历史，告诉我们一个太明白不过的基本教训：决不为反动派所吓唬住；决不要害怕，随时随地准备应付挑拨者、拐骗者搞他们的肮脏勾当。随时随地予以反击。这对于各民族、各阶级及各个个人都是如此；对于职工会、进步团体和进步政党也都是如此；而且对种族及宗教中的少数派也莫不如此。
    让我在这一问题上提醒你：纳粹的独裁其实是发展到了最高度的反对所谓“非德活动”的委员会。它暗杀、虐杀成千百万的高尚德国人和各国的人民，因为他们不照纳粹标准思考和行动，而这就是“非德活动”。你难道在美国能不听到：有人想要处罚世界上每一个不遵守你们非美活动委员会的标准和思想的人吗？
    只要我一天被迫住在美国，只要我一天能够用我的笔，而且只要我一天不被禁止说话，我便要进行反击。而且我将利用一切机会进行反击，并感谢给我的每一个机会。坦白地说，我认为美国自由进步力量将给我更多的反击机会。
    在我的一生中，我曾经在不少的国家中待过，或者是作为一个希特勒上台前的德国共产党记者，或者作为一个希特勒上台后的政治流亡者。但是在我所到之处，我的活动都只与反对德国反动派、法西斯主义及其国际支派的斗争相联系，与动员一切可能的援助支持德国地下斗争的工作相联系。
    在我留住美国期间，我认为尽力支援美国及其盟国反对德国法西斯和日本帝国主义的战争努力是我的责任。
    如果我提到这些活动，决不是因为我想夸耀我所做的那一点点工作，而是因为我不得不说明我的活动。我曾经以鲜血捐输血库，而且曾因忠于防空监视员的职务而得到奖状和奖章。作为一个记者，我用我的笔支持盟国事业，拥护盟国团结，而且特别反对德美协会会员（在美国的纳粹分子组织——译者）和其他美国酷爱纳粹的人在祖籍德国的美国人中所散布的有毒的思想和混乱。在这一方面，我得承认：我曾写过文章反对汤普逊女士，当她宣传与德国讲和，并说与苏联作战更好的时候。
    我也给共产党记者（例如我的朋友史塔罗宾，优秀的报纸“工人日报”的国际编辑）供给我对于德国与欧洲问题的意见和资料，他把这些稿子用他想出来的“汉斯·白尔吉尔”的笔名发表了。作为一个自觉的记者和时论家，我的朋友史塔罗宾对于不完全是他自己所写的东西，不用自己的名字发表。有好些记者可以从他这种对于业务的忠实上学习到一些东西。
    在“德籍美国人”上，我应已故的罗森费尔德之邀，写过专论，有些署名，有些未署名。我并和另外两位德国友人合著“德国的教训”一书，一本描写德国反动派和纳粹暗杀艺术的书。我诚心希望永不须要写一本类似的书：“美国的教训”。
    在我住留美国期间，我很喜爱美国人民。
    如是说布登兹（美共叛徒，叛变后加入美国天主教，进行造谣诬蔑的无耻勾当）所说的话里还有哪一点不是虚假的话，那就是他不自觉地承认：我写文章拥护站在美国、盟国方面作战；我是坚信大国需要团结的人。我老实相信这与这次检举（即说艾斯勒是德国间谍，共产国际派到美国指导美共的代表等——译者）有些关系。我写文章反对屠杀了千百万人民的罪恶的哲学，这种哲学推动兰金（美民主党众议员，非美活动委员会委员，反共反民主的反动头子）先生进行所谓调查。对于这种哲学我一生只有蔑视。
    显然，如果我的文章支持纳粹，我就会被赫斯特系报纸（美国报纸托辣斯，反苏反共反民主的宣传机关之一）其他出版物及兰金的委员会看成高贵的人物。如果我象汤普逊女士那样出而主张与希特勒德国讲和，并且与参议员塔虎脱和汤普逊女士（纽约先驱论坛报反动专栏作家——译者）为战犯被绞一掬同情之泪，我想我会已经得到十分不同的待遇。汤普逊女士也许会邀我出席她的人道会议，而不会表示希望在狱中见到我了。
    如果我认为中国的前途在于屠杀成百成千的农民和工人，不会有人控我有非美活动。如果我污蔑铁托、南斯拉夫和阿尔巴尼亚人民，我将被认为是一个很可尊敬的人。如果我爱佛朗哥（西班牙独裁者），西恩会象爱布登兹一样地爱我。如果我因为苏联具有最高级的社会组织形式而作些反对它的战争宣传，我大概会被允许在西德重新教育德国青年，以被无耻地叫做“真正的民主精神”去教育他们。
    我和美国共产党的关系怎样？我这个德国反法西斯流亡者真的给美国共产党发号施令吗？他们接到过命令吗？没有，我没有指导美国共产党。我如果这样做，他们会认为我发了疯。
    我知道贵国的每一件东西都是伟大的，显然贵国的特务挑拨分子和某些相信这些家伙的人们的愚笨，也是伟大的。
    我尊敬美国共产党，因为他们反对反动派的斗争，并在这一斗争中争取和平与团结。
    我见到美国共产党人和进步分子在反佛朗哥、希特勒、墨索里尼的不朽的国际纵队行列中作战。过去我仅从书本上学到的东西，现在却从生活中认识到了，这就是美国人能多么勇敢地为一个优良的事业而斗争。在西班牙作战的美国英雄中，是没有兰金这一流人的。
    作为一名德国反法西斯分子，我对于美共关于德国问题的立场感觉愉快，这是许许多多有远见的美国人的立场。作为一个德国反法西斯分子，我参加那些尖锐批评西方各国占领政策的美国人的行列。美国驻德军事总督麦克纳涅将军（现为克莱将军，华尔街的反动代理人）曾经说过：憎恨德国的时代已经过去了。说得好漂亮！但是，这个时代不应为爱德国反动派的时代来代替。
    我只有一个意愿，回到祖国分担我国同胞的苦难，并与那些正为德国人民寻求幸福温饱生活的人们一道斗争。
