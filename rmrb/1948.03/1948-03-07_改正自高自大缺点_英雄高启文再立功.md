Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th—Gao Qiwen, squad leader of the 4th squad of the 1st company of the Pingyi (newly established county, formerly southern Feixian) stretcher-bearer battalion, active on the East China front, has repeatedly rendered meritorious service during his service and was selected as an East China Stretcher-Bearer Hero. When the entire battalion was awarded the honorary title of "Chen Yi Stretcher-Bearer Battalion," the 4th squad was also praised as a model squad of the 1st company. Shandong Dazhong Daily, Lunan Times, and other newspapers have introduced Gao Qiwen's exemplary deeds. Stretcher-bearer laborers in Zhucheng and Yizhong also proposed learning from Gao and competing with him in Dazhong Daily. A certain column of the People's Liberation Army even invited Gao to attend the merit celebration meeting of the entire column, and the military and political leaders praised Gao's exemplary actions at the meeting. These rewards generated complacency and arrogance in Gao Qiwen's thinking. He would always say things like, "The column leaders gave me flowers and even ate with me..." His lifestyle became pretentious and detached from the masses. Some people reflected: "He was very good to me every time I set off with him, but now his temper has changed." To this end, the battalion cadres specially took advantage of the opportunity when Gao Qiwen was rated as a "Special Class Meritorious Person" by the entire regiment to hold a small "Good News and Merit Celebration Meeting" and invited the squad leaders of the 1st company to participate. Aiming at Gao Qiwen's ideological problems, everyone used lively forms such as chats and a cappella to conduct education and encouragement. Niu Xushan, a third-class meritorious person, said: "I am very happy that Qiwen has become a special-class meritorious person, but we must not be arrogant and complacent and let others carry away the model banner." Xiao Guo, the company's correspondent, sang: "I, Xiao Guo, am young and often miss home, model brother often tells me principles and chats about home, supports the front line and doesn't miss my mother, and also made second-class merit." Then he asked: "Model brother hasn't talked to me much these past few days, could it be that he looks down on me now that he has become a special-class meritorious person?" Finally, the battalion instructor pointed out in his speech: "Gao Qiwen's achievements are mainly due to uniting the masses and relying on the masses," and encouraged him not to be complacent. Many people's encouragement combined with criticism touched Gao Qiwen's thinking. He deeply examined his shortcomings of arrogance and complacency and expressed his determination to correct them. Since then, he has been more active, and his ideological emotions have improved. He united the entire squad to successfully complete the task, and everyone was credited when they were demobilized. The squad members praised his leadership style on the wall newspaper, saying: "Our squad leader is really good, everyone discusses things together, gives food to everyone, and always strives to do the work first."

　　改正自高自大缺点
  　英雄高启文再立功
    【新华社华东四日电】活跃华东前线的平邑（新设县原费县南部）担架营一连四班班长高启文，在服务期间屡立功劳，被选为华东担架英雄。为全营荣获“陈毅担架营”的光荣称号时，四班又被誉为一连的模范班。山东大众日报、鲁南时报等都介绍高启文的模范事迹。诸城和沂中的担架民工也在大众日报上提出向高学习和竞赛。解放军某纵队并请高出席全纵队的贺功大会，军政首长都在会上表扬高的模范行动。这些奖励在高启文的思想上产生了自满自大，开口便是“纵队首长给我戴花还陪我吃饭……”生活作风上摆起架子来，脱离群众。有些群众反映说：“我每次跟他出发他都很好，可是现在脾气变了。”为此，营干部特地利用高启文被全团评为“特等功臣”的时机，召开了一个小型的“报喜贺功会”，并邀请一连各班长参加。针对着高启文的思想毛病。大家用漫谈清唱等活泼形式来进行教育和鼓励。丙等功臣牛盱山说：“启文哥成了特等功臣，我很高兴，咱哥儿可别自高自大，把模范旗叫人家扛跑。”连部通讯员小郭唱道：“我小郭年轻常想家、模范哥时常对我说道理谈家常，支援前线不想娘，二等功劳也立下。”接着又发问：“模范哥这两天怎么不大给谈话了，该不是当了特等功臣看不起我了罢？”最后，营教导员在发言中着重指出：“高启文的成绩主要是团结群众，依靠群众得来的”，并勉励他不要自满。许多人结合鼓励的批评，打动了高启文的思想，他深刻地检讨了自高自大的缺点，并表示决心改正。从此，表现更积极，思想情绪上有了进步，团结全班胜利完成任务，复员时每人都立了功。班员们在墙报上称赞他的领导作风说：“咱们的班长真正好，有事大家商量办，有饭让给大家吃，有活总是争先做。”
