Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: London dispatch: British Communist Party leader Pollitt, on behalf of the Central Executive Committee of the British Communist Party on the 16th, attacked Attlee's anti-communist statement in the House of Commons. Pollitt stated: "We call on all those who firmly believe in political freedom and democracy to rise up and protest the government's decision." Pollitt denounced Attlee's statement as "an insult to every anti-fascist martyr" and a "despicable slander against communists." He pointed out: "Communists, no matter where they are, stand at the forefront of defending national independence and fighting against fascism," "but Attlee now declares that the government's intention is to deter the advance of communism in Britain by intimidating and sacrificing communists in government agencies." "We urge all manual and intellectual laborers to note that in Britain, the government's attacks on the Communist Party have never failed to be a prelude to an attack on the entire working class." Pollitt concluded: "The government's measures have absolutely nothing to do with guaranteeing Britain's security; on the contrary, this security is being rapidly destroyed due to the government's own erroneous policies and its unprincipled alliance with American imperialism. Therefore, the government's measures are merely a governmental means adopted to win the favor of the Conservative Party and Wall Street."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: London dispatch: After Attlee clamored in the House of Commons on the 15th to "cleanse" communists from British "security" administrative organs, it aroused the anger of progressives, and progressive members of the British Communist Party and the Labour Party denounced it. The Workers' Daily pointed out in an editorial on the 16th: The Labour government now dares to engage in anti-communist activities that the Conservative Party did not dare to plot, which is the beginning of establishing a police state in Britain. Communists are model workers in the government. Attlee's "cleansing" of them is an attack on the people's basic political rights and an erosion of democracy and human rights. It is bound to be resisted by all those who believe that freedom is inviolable. Communist MPs Gallacher and Piratin formally submitted a motion in the House of Commons on the 16th, protesting against Attlee's anti-communist statement and condemning Attlee's statement as "a new expression of the British government's complete obedience to American monopoly capitalists and an insulting discrimination against certain civil servants." Horner, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers and member of the Central Committee of the British Communist Party, angrily denounced Attlee's statement on the 17th as a fascist measure. Labour MP Hockingson said on the 15th that Attlee's statement "threatens every liberal and free-thinking person," because anyone who holds a different view from the Conservatives and fascists on the Soviet Union will be labeled a communist. Another Labour MP, Harveys, also criticized Attlee's statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: London dispatch: Local organizations of the Labour Party and trade unions across Britain have recently submitted many resolutions to the Labour Party Congress to be held in May, criticizing the Labour government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies. Among the more than 300 proposals from various places, not one fails to criticize the Labour government to some extent. About 40 of them comment on wages, prices, and profits; more than 30 attack the anti-Soviet and pro-American foreign policy; and 11 proposals call for strong measures to stop racial discrimination and fascist activities. The proposal of the Transport and General Workers' Union states: We believe with serious concern that the rise in prices is unjustified. The Barnet Labour Party district branch, with 1,000 members, stated: The policy expressed by the government in the White Paper on freezing wages is not in the interests of the working class unless prices and profits are also frozen. The Railway Clerks' Association suggested that the Labour Party Congress should declare: "Only a courageous and broad socialist plan can eliminate the current crisis and gradually improve living standards." The Gateshead Labour Party district branch, with 1,100 members, called on the Labour Party to adhere to the principles of the United Nations and abolish the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Spearce district branch, with 2,000 members, pointed out: "The government's foreign policy has become a slave to the United States" and demanded cooperation with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The Solihull district branch, with more than 1,100 members, expressed regret over Attlee and Bevin's anti-Soviet and pro-American speeches in January.

      艾德礼取媚美帝侮蔑英共
   　波立特提出严正抗议
     工党地方组织斥责当局反动政策
    【新华社陕北二十日电】伦敦讯：英共领袖波立特于十六日代表英共中央执行委员会，抨斥艾德礼在下院的反共声明。波氏称：“我们号召一切坚信政治自由与民主的人们，起来抗议政府的这一决定”。波氏指斥艾德礼声明“是对每个反法西斯烈士的侮辱”，是“对共产党人的卑鄙侮蔑”。他指出：“共产党人不管在任何地方，都站在保卫国家独立反对法西斯作战的最前列”，“可是艾德礼现在却宣布政府的意向是要以威吓与牺牲政府机关中的共产党人来遏止共产主义在英国的前进”。“我们促请一切体力与智力劳动者注意：在英国，政府对共产党的攻击，从来没有一次不是对整个工人阶级进攻的前奏”。波氏结语称：“政府的措施与保证英国安全绝无关系，恰恰相反，由于政府自己的错误政策及其与美帝国主义的无原则联合，这种安全正在被迅速地破毁着。因此，政府的措施只是为了取得保守党和华尔街的欢心而采取的一种政府手段”。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】伦敦讯：当艾德礼于十五日在下院叫嚣“清除”英国“安全”行政机关中的共产党人后，激起进步人士的愤怒，英共及工党进步议员纷予痛斥。工人日报十六日在社论中指出：工党政府现在竟胆敢来干保守党未敢图谋的反共勾当，这是在英国建立警察国的开始。共产党人在政府中都是模范工作者，艾德礼“清除”他们，是对人民基本政治权利的进攻，是对民主与人权的侵蚀，它势必遭到深信自由不可侵犯的人们的全力抵抗。共产党议员加拉彻与皮拉汀十六日正式在下院提出议案，抗议艾德礼的反共声明，谴责艾德礼声明“为英政府完全服从于美国垄断资本家的新表示，为对某些公务员的侮辱性歧视。”全国矿工联盟总书记英共中委霍尔纳于十七日怒斥艾德礼的声明是法西斯性的措施。工党议员荷金生于十五日说：艾德礼的声明“威胁着每一个自由主义与具有自由思想的人”，因为任何和保守党与法西斯分子对苏联持有不同观点的人，都会被强加上一个共产党的头衔。另一工党议员哈维斯亦对艾德礼声明加以抨击。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】伦敦讯：英国各地工党与工会地方组织，近向行将于五月举行的工党大会提出许多决议案，抨击工党政府反动的内外政策。在各地三百余件提案中，没有一件不或多或少的批评工党政府的，其中四十件左右评论到工资、物价与利润；三十件以上抨击反苏媚美的外交政策；十一件提案要求采取强有力措施，制止种族歧视及法西斯活动。运输与各业工人工会的提案中称：我们以严重的忧虑心情，认为物价的上涨是不正当的。具有一千党员的巴尼特工党区支部称：政府在关于冻结工资的白皮书中所表示的政策，并不是为了工人阶级的利益，除非同时也冻结物价和利润。火车售票员工会建议工党大会应宣布：“只有勇敢而广泛的社会主义计划，才可能消除目前的危机，并逐步改善生活水准”。具有一千一百党员的加特希德工党区支部，呼吁工党忠于联合国原则，撤销美英联合参谋部。具有二千党员的斯皮尔色区支部指出：“政府的外交政策作了美国的奴仆”，要求与苏联及东欧各国合作。具有一千一百余党员的索里荷尔区支部，对艾德礼与贝文在一月中的反苏媚美演说，表示痛心。
