Huangjiachuan Land Reform and Party Consolidation Successfully Concluded
　　Mutual Aid and Cooperation for Universal Production

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th】After the successful conclusion of the land reform and party consolidation in Huangjiachuan Village, Yihe District, Suide County, the village immediately transitioned to intense production. The entire village began delivering manure as early as the sixth day of the first lunar month and has already started plowing the land with oxen. The issue of seeds for the twenty-nine households lacking them has been resolved. Out of the seventy-three laborers in the village, fifty-four have formed sixteen mutual-aid teams. The most serious problem before the spring plowing was the lack of draught animals. However, thanks to the joint efforts of the farmers' association and the villagers, three oxen and six and a half donkeys have been purchased (one donkey is being raised jointly with a neighboring village). Huang Xiangcheng and Huang Wenhai, who have been hired laborers for over twenty years, have historically relied on manual labor instead of animal power, always planting last. This year, the farmers' association helped them buy an ox, and they have already planted broad beans. Among the seven middle-peasant households that voluntarily offered land, four have livestock, and half of their manure has already been delivered. Two households have newly purchased livestock, and another has partnered with the farmers' association to buy a donkey. All landlords (three households) and two rich-peasant households have also joined the mutual-aid organizations. Landlord Ma Chao-hai, who rarely labored his whole life, has been learning to produce since last winter. Landlord Xue Yinghua, in addition to farming and his wife's weaving, has also opened a small tofu workshop. The farmers' association has provided seeds for the three landlord households and established production labor plans. Farmer Huang Pengnian, who turned over a new leaf, is a leader in production, getting up to deliver manure before dawn. Huang Congsheng, a second-rate loafer, is also actively participating in labor. People are all smiling and saying, "Our village is going to be great this year. We must produce well!"

　　Before the spring plowing was launched in the village, there were three main problems among the masses: (1) a lack of livestock and food; (2) concerns about how to fairly and reasonably distribute burdens; and (3) a lack of understanding of the policies for developing production and achieving prosperity through labor. How to promptly and correctly solve these difficulties became the key to carrying out spring plowing. The farmers' association first used its greatest efforts to help solve the livestock shortage, selling silver jewelry from the fruits of the struggle to raise funds. Truly poor farmers could partner together to use public funds to buy livestock, while others received partial assistance or temporary loans from public funds. Those who were afraid of taking on too many tasks and did not want to buy livestock were given explanations and persuaded. The issue of food was resolved by making the grain obtained from the struggle public property, democratically distributing it among the villagers. The most destitute orphans and individual poor farmers who lacked a production base were given relief according to population, while others received partial or temporary subsidies. Middle peasants were particularly concerned about how to fairly and reasonably distribute burdens. Before spring plowing, some individuals had said, "It's enough to have enough to eat next year; don't be too diligent." To address this, the work team organized mass discussions, promoting prosperity through labor. Using the fact that the land and property of middle peasants in the village had largely remained untouched, and the fact that property was being returned to middle peasants in nearby villages who had been wrongly accused, the team explained the Communist Party's policy of firmly uniting with middle peasants. At the same time, the farmers' association urged those who were not working hard to make production plans. The entire village is now swept up in a production craze.

　　黄家川土改整党胜利结束
  　互助互剂人人生产
    【新华社西北十二日电】绥德县义合区黄家川村土改及整党胜利结束后，即转入紧张的生产。全村农历正月初六即开始送粪，并已出牛揭地。二十九户没有种子的已获解决。全村七十三个劳动力，已有五十四人组成十六个变工小组。春耕前最严重的问题是缺乏耕畜。但由于农会和村民共同努力的结果，已买到牛三头、驴六头半（有一头驴是和邻村伙喂的）。揽工二十多年的黄向城、黄文海，历年来靠人工变畜工，总种在最后，今年农会帮助给买了牛，现已种过莞豆。七家自动献出土地的中农，四家有牲口，粪已送了一半，两家新买了牲口，另一家则与农会合伙买了驴。所有地主（三户）与两户富农也参加了变工组织。一生很少劳动的地主马超海，从去冬起即已开始学习生产。地主薛英华除种地及他女人纺织而外，还开了个小豆腐作坊，农会已给三户地主调剂了种子，订好生产劳动计划。翻身后的农民黄朋年是生产中的带头人，不等到天亮，就起来送粪。二流打卦的黄从圣也积极参加了劳动。人民都笑着说：“今年咱们村里可闹美啦，咱们一定要好好生产。”
    该村在春耕未发动前，群众中存在着三个问题：（一）缺乏畜力口粮，（二）顾虑负担如何公平合理，（三）对发展生产、劳动致富的政策还不大了解。如何及时正确地解决这些困难，成为开展春耕的关键。农会首先用最大的力量扶助解决牲口困难，曾将斗争果实中的银器首饰卖掉做为资金，确实贫苦的农民可几家合伙用公金买牲口，其余或帮助一部分，或由公金中暂借，并鼓励有力购买者自买，对怕差事多，而不买牲口的，则加以解释说服。口粮问题则将分得斗争粮食作为公有，由全村群众民主调剂，最困难的孤寡及个别尚无生产基础的贫农，按人口救济，其余或部分补助，或临时补助。中农对负担如何公平合理，特别关心。在春耕前个别人曾说：“明年够吃就对，不要太勤俭”，工作组为此，特组织群众漫谈，提倡劳动致富，以本村中农土地财产基本未动，及附近村对斗错的中农退还财物的事实，说明共产党坚决联合中农的政策，同时由农会督促劳动不好的人作生产计划。现全村已卷入生产热潮。
