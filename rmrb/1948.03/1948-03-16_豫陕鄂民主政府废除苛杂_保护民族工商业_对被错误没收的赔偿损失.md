　　Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 13th: The Yu-Shaan-E People's Democratic Government, in order to resolutely protect national industry and commerce and compensate those who have been infringed upon, has recently promulgated twelve articles on industrial and commercial policy by the Yu-Shaan-E Border Region Administrative Office. These articles emphasize that the democratic government abolishes all exorbitant taxes and levies, implements free trade within the liberated areas, encourages local products, resists American goods, and resolutely protects the property and legal business operations of national industrialists and merchants. National capitalists from the KMT-controlled areas are welcome to operate factories and shops or invest in the liberated areas, and they will be provided with convenience and assistance. Low-interest loans will be provided to support the development of small-scale handicrafts, workshops, household sideline occupations, and peddlers. Except for bureaucratic capital confiscated by the government in accordance with the law, no other agency, organization, or military unit may arbitrarily confiscate or damage private industry and commerce. All tools and materials of private industrial and commercial enterprises that have been used must be returned to their original owners. If the original owners are not present, they should be handed over to the government for safekeeping and efforts should be made to notify them to return home to collect them.
    At present, deviations in the implementation of policies in various regions are being corrected. A flour company in Yuxian County, which was wrongly confiscated by a certain unit, was immediately returned in full upon discovery, and the company is now continuing its business as usual. The stone printing machines lost by Zhenhua and Xinji Stone Printing Houses in Xiangcheng have been compensated by the democratic government at market prices, and a sincere apology has been made to the original owners.
