　　Production Has Become Stagnant in the Eighth District of Wu'an: Village Cadres Must Take Responsibility
  　To the Editor:
    I am a clerk at the Yongmao Chang General Store in Wu'an. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, I went to understand the rural textile situation to buy cloth. According to a letter from a comrade from our store who went there, most cadres in the Eighth District, some of whom are over-profiteering, and some who do not understand the spirit of the Land Law Outline, have become afraid and do not lead the work in the villages, so the masses' production has become stagnant. Two-thirds of the weaving has completely stopped. If this continues, I am afraid that the number of productions in the liberated areas will suffer losses. My opinion is that the superiors of the cadres of each system should order their subordinates to continue to pay attention to leading the masses' production before the cadres are replaced during the land reform. Otherwise, not only will the entire economy of the liberated areas suffer losses, but especially the poor farmers in the disaster areas will suffer losses in production, and they will have no other source of food, and they will not be able to get through this spring.

　　武安八区生产自流
  　村干要负责任编辑同志：
    我是武安永茂昌总栈一个营业员，阴历正月十五日，为了买布下去了解农村纺织情况。据本栈下去的同志来信说，八区大多数干部，有的多占果实，有的不了解土地法大纲的精神，他就害怕起来，对村上的工作也不进行领导，群众生产自流，有三分之二的纺织完全停止。如此发展下去，恐怕解放区生产数目上要受到损失。我的意见，各系统干部的上级给下级下令，在土地改革中未撤换前的干部，仍注意领导群众生产。不然不但整个的解放区经济上受损失，尤其是灾荒区的贫苦农民在生产上受了损失，再没有其他粮食来源，今年的春季就过不去。（郭善治）
