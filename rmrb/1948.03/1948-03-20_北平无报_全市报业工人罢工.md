　　No Newspapers in Beiping
  　Citywide Strike by Newspaper Workers
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th】 According to various sources: Workers in all twenty newspaper companies in Beiping went on a citywide strike starting on the 12th due to the capitalists' refusal to improve their conditions. On the 13th, only one small newspaper was published; all others were unavailable. Labor and management are currently in negotiations. In other news: Employees of the Song family's China Bank in Shanghai staged another sit-down strike for two hours on the 13th, protesting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' arrest of three leaders of the bank's "Fellowship Association" and the suppression of employee strike actions demanding improved treatment. Work resumed only after the bank authorities agreed to vouch for the release of the three arrested employees.
