Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—London: The 20th National Congress of the British Communist Party grandly opened here on the 21st. One thousand delegates attended, and the Communist Parties of France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and Northern Ireland sent representatives. Gallacher, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, delivered the opening speech, stating that the current economic crisis in Britain is inseparable from the anti-Soviet policy formulated by the Conservative Party and implemented by the Labor Party. Bevin is implementing Churchill's proposal in Fulton (referring to Churchill's first call for a joint Anglo-American anti-Soviet alliance in the United States in early March 1946). The Labor Party's policy is not only influenced by the Conservative Party but is also under strong pressure from the U.S. State Department. Gallacher criticized the Labor Party's domestic policy, saying it harmed the primary interests of the working people, and called on the congress to strengthen the unity of the working class in the struggle to strive for the road to socialism.

At the meeting on the 22nd, delegates from various regions criticized the Labor Party's policies that harmed the interests of the British working class. Lanley, a representative from Scotland, stated that in September of last year, 50,000 people were unemployed in Scotland, and in January of this year, it had increased to 59,000. Lanley pointed out that the government is willing to destroy British industry for a handful of dollars. Gray, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Northern Ireland, announced that due to the threat of the Marshall Plan to the shipbuilding industry in Northern Ireland, unemployment among shipbuilding workers in Northern Ireland is increasing. Collins, a steelworker from South Wales, revealed that the Labor authorities are employing large numbers of reactionary exiles from Eastern Europe to spread anti-Soviet ideas among British workers to help the Labor authorities. Lee, a cotton worker from Lancashire, confirmed Collins's words, pointing out that in the cotton industry, skilled female workers earn 60 to 70 shillings per week (20 shillings equals one pound), but these reactionary exiles are paid a trainee wage of five pounds per week after being employed.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—Moscow: The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) recently sent a telegram to the 20th National Congress of the British Communist Party, expressing congratulations. The original telegram read: "The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) sends greetings to all the representatives of the 20th Congress of the British Communist Party, hoping that the British Communist Party will achieve success in its work. Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (signed)."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—London: The 20th National Congress of the British Communist Party, which opened on the 21st, successfully concluded on the evening of the 24th. In addition to re-electing the Central Committee and approving the general policies of the party, the congress passed several important resolutions. The main ones are: (1) Opposing the right-wing Labor government; (2) Opposing the wage freeze policy; (3) Increasing production and safeguarding British independence. The resolution on the domestic economic situation pointed out: "The Labor government's decision to reduce steel for shipbuilding by 20 percent was made at the behest of American imperialism." The resolution called for an increase in the planting of wheat and potatoes in the next four years.

　　英共举行全国大会
  　决议反对工党右翼政府
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】伦敦讯：英共第二十届全国代表大会，于二十一日在此间隆重揭幕。出席代表一千人，法、意、奥、西、与北爱尔兰诸国共产党均派代表出席。英共执委会主席加拉彻致开幕词称：目前英国的经济危机，是与保守党所拟订、而由工党所执行的反苏政策不可分离的。贝文正在把邱吉尔在富尔顿的建议（按指四六年三月初邱吉尔在美国第一次所作英美联合反苏叫嚣）付诸实施。工党政策不仅受保守党影响，而且是在美国务院强大压力之下。加氏抨击工党内政政策，说它损害劳动人民的主要利益，并号召大会加强团结工人阶级的斗争，以争取走向社会主义的道路。
    二十二日会上，各地代表纷纷抨击损害英国工人阶级利益的工党政策。苏格兰代表兰莱恩称：去年九月份，苏格兰有五万人失业，而今年一月份已增至五万九千人。兰氏指出：政府正在为了一撮美元，而甘愿摧毁英国工业。北爱尔兰共产党中委格雷宣布，由于马歇尔计划对北爱造船业的威胁，北爱造船工人之失业正在增加。南威尔士钢铁工人考林斯则揭露工党当局正大批雇用东欧反动流亡分子，在英国工人中散布反苏思想，以帮助工党当局。兰开夏棉花工人李氏证实考林斯的话，指出在棉花工业中，熟练女工每周工资六十到七十先令（按二十先令为一镑），然而这些反动流亡分子被雇用后，其见习工资每周即达五镑。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】莫斯科讯：联共（布）中央委员会日前致电英国共产党第二十届全国代表大会，表示祝贺。原电如下：“联共（布）中央委员会向英共第二十届代表大会全体代表致贺，希望英共在其工作上获得成功。联共（布）中央委员会书记苏斯洛夫（签名）”。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】伦敦讯：二十一日开幕的英共第二十届全国代表大会，已于二十四日晚胜利闭幕。大会除重选中央委员会并批准党的一般政策外，并通过重要决议多件。其中主要者为：（一）反对工党右翼政府；（二）反对冻结工资政策；（三）增加生产，保障英国独立。关于国内经济情况的决议指出：“工党政府关于造船用钢减少百分之二十的决定，是奉美国帝国主义之命的。”决议要求未来四年中增加小麦与马铃薯的种植。
