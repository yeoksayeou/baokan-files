A total of 146 enemy personnel, including a captured enemy detachment leader, were taken prisoner; 125 enemies were killed or wounded; 96 long and short guns and 7 light and heavy machine guns were seized; 16 large carts of grain were intercepted; and the last three bridgehead fortresses of the Chiang army at Fenglingdu, Taiyangdu, and Shawodu in the Southern Shanxi triangle area were uprooted, completely clearing the situation in the Southern Shanxi triangle area. The battle situation on each front is described below:
    West Front: On the 3rd of this month, the Taiyue Fifth Military Sub-district troops ambushed an enemy detachment of local Chiang Kai-shek forces at Pingdingshan, Song County, capturing the enemy detachment leader Xiao Jingxuan and more than ten others, killing or wounding 40 enemies, and seizing three light and heavy machine guns and 55 long and short guns. We suffered no casualties.

The remaining enemies fled in panic across the Yellow River. At this time, the defending troops of the Chiang bandits' entire First Division at Taiyangdu (south of Pinglu), another bridgehead fortress in Southern Shanxi, were also intimidated by our military might and fled south across the river on the same day. The enemy guarding the third bridgehead fortress, Fenglingdu, had already fled south across the Yellow River five days earlier.
