　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: Rangoon dispatch: A mass demonstration of thousands of people erupted here on the 18th, protesting the Burmese authorities' anti-popular and anti-democratic measures. It is reported that this demonstration was initiated by the Burmese Communist Party led by Thakin Than Tun. The demonstrators' slogans were "Down with the government of the Freedom League!" and "Repeal the order banning assemblies and demonstrations!" Several Indians also participated in the ranks of the demonstrators. The demonstration took place after the Burmese authorities arrested Burmese Communist leader Thakin So on the night of the 10th, and it is widely believed that this represents a new unfolding of the struggle of Burma's progressive democratic forces to support those arrested and fight for broad democratic rights. Simultaneously with the launch of the demonstration, a strike is brewing among the workers in Rangoon. Workers at the British-operated Rangoon Electric Power Company are demanding payment of wartime back wages and improved working conditions, and they have stated that if their demands are not met soon, they will strike. Other workers have also made similar demands.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 24th: Saigon dispatch: The attempt by U.S. imperialism to meddle in Vietnam through the Schumann government has been fiercely criticized in Vietnamese public opinion. Former U.S. Ambassador to France and warmonger Bullitt, since his recommendation last December that France support Vietnamese reactionaries and stop negotiations with the Viet Minh, was recently ordered to conduct a "visit" to Vietnam under the pretext of "studying" the Franco-Vietnamese dispute. The Saigon "Public Opinion" newspaper exposed this, saying: Bullitt's report may lead to U.S. interference in Vietnam. "Although U.S. imperialists are supporting France, in reality they are trying to take over France's position in Vietnam." Bullitt's visit to Vietnam "is a sign of U.S. imperialists' attempt to strengthen their influence in Southeast Asia." The newspaper also criticized the French colonialists for their shameless dependence on the United States. The "Forum" newspaper pointed out that the United States is in fact trying to seize Vietnam's resources, and its overall attempt is to dominate Southeast Asia.
