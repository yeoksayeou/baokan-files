　　Regarding Comrade Cui Wanjing's Self-Reflection
  　Opinions from the Masses of Niuwabu Village

To the Editors:
    Regarding Comrade Cui Wanjing's self-reflection in the "Returning from Workers and Peasants to Workers and Peasants" column on the 14th of February, the masses of this village have some opinions on his self-reflection: First, his blacksmithing skills are not up to six generations. The masses say his grandfather and father were blacksmiths, but he looked down on blacksmithing work. His father earned some money by blacksmithing for others, but he spent it all on eating and drinking extravagantly in the streets. Second, there was a soldier in this village named Feng Nuoshan who sacrificed himself at the front line three months ago. He forced Feng Nuoshan's wife to marry him. After the marriage, he took all the things from her house, leaving an old woman in her forties or fifties who couldn't make a living. Third, why doesn't he reflect on the fruit he illegally occupied? Almost all the good fruit in this village was taken by the village cadres. Cui Wanjing's family possesses very exquisite porcelain items. The masses say that Cui Wanjing returned once after the fifteenth day of the first month (Chinese New Year) and "prepared for war" with the things in his house. Fourth, in the spring of last year, Cui Wanjing went to join the turning-over team (land reform working group), and when he returned in the winter of last year, he demanded six hundred jin of millet from the village. The masses were dissatisfied. Later, Cui Wanjing "generously" reduced it to three hundred jin of this inferior millet. Fifth, there are places where he has not reflected on himself. He has not thoroughly reflected on illegally occupying fruit, not working, and his rogue behavior. We particularly hope that he will reflect on the fruit he illegally occupied.

　　对崔万景同志的反省
  　牛窊堡群众有意见编辑同志：
    二月十四日的报上登的“来自工农回到工农”栏崔万景同志的反省，本村群众对他的反省有意见：一、他的打铁不够六辈，群众谈他爷他爹是个铁匠，到他这一辈他根本就看不起打铁活，他父亲给人家打铁赚下几个钱，他在街上大吃二喝都花了。二、本村有个战士叫冯挪山，在前方牺牲，有三个来月，他就强迫冯挪山女人和他结婚，结了婚把人家家里东西都给拿走，人家家里还留下个四五十岁的老婆婆没法过。三、他多占的果实，他为什么不反省？这村的好果实差不多都叫村干占去了。崔万景家里占有很讲究的瓷家伙。群众谈崔万景过正月十五回来了一次，把家里的东西都“备战”起来了。四、去年春天的时候，崔万景去当翻身队，到去年冬天时回来，和本村要六百斤小米，群众不满，后来崔万景“大方”了一下，只要了三百斤米，这顶差米。五、他有的地方就没有反省，多占果实、不劳动、流氓，都反省的不彻底，特别希望他要把多占的果实反省反省。（韩清岩代写）
