Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Reports from various sources: Democratic women worldwide are commemorating March 8th with struggles to defend democracy and peace and oppose new war instigators. On this day, the International Democratic Women's Federation, representing 80 million women from 42 countries, issued a call, urging women to do their utmost to prevent "American imperialism from plunging the world into another war." The Federation pointed out that "American imperialism has already launched wars in China and Greece" and called on women to oppose the bloody wars of imperialism against Vietnam and Indonesia. The Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, representing all Soviet women, sent congratulatory telegrams to democratic women's organizations in various countries, hoping that they would achieve victory in the struggle against reactionaries and instigators of new wars. In a telegram to the International Democratic Women's Federation, Soviet women expressed their hope that the Federation would concentrate the strength of democratic women worldwide to oppose reactionaries and strive for the realization of equal rights in all aspects. London and forty other cities in Britain will simultaneously hold grand public celebrations. The Yugoslav Women's Anti-Fascist Front, in a letter to the International Democratic Women's Federation, expressed its anger at the verdict of Nazi generals passed by the American Tribunal in Nuremberg, believing that "this verdict once again proves that American imperialism is using every means to rescue German Nazis in order to create a threat to the freedom and peace of the world." Romanian women's organizations announced: "1.3 million members are determined to fight against warmongers and safeguard peace."
