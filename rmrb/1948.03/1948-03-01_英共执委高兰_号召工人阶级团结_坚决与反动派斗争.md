Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: London Dispatch: Gollan, a member of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, delivered a speech at the 20th National Congress of the British Communist Party on the 22nd, discussing the current tasks of the British Communist Party and the British working class, stating: Do not be afraid to expose the reactionary policies of the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party. The Labour Party is currently leading the opposition to the international unity of the working class and is plotting to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions. Regarding the slogan of a "Left-Wing Government," Gollan pointed out: Any new left-wing Labour government must be organized by the best, most progressive, and most combative parts of the workers' movement. Many people agree with this point, but if the mass workers' movement is not promoted with the central issues of economy and politics as the core, then raising this issue will only be a hypocritical hope. Gollan then asked: Is the time ripe for mass movements? Are laborers prepared to fight on the issue of wages and fight against rising prices? Are Communists capable of uniting the millions of people who are now opposed to the threat of a new anti-Soviet war by imperialism? His answer was affirmative. He said that if Communists point out the correct path, the movement will develop. To this end, Gollan emphasized the necessity of eliminating all remnants of sectarianism within the party to achieve the unity of the working class. Gollan called for struggles to be launched in various places to ensure that workers express their opinions at the upcoming Labour Party conference. Gollan concluded forcefully: Without mass movements, we cannot change the government. This is the central issue facing our party congress.

  　坚决与反动派斗争
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】伦敦讯：英共执委高兰二十二日在英共第二十届全国代表大会上发表演说，论述英共及英国工人阶级当前任务称：不要害怕揭露工党右翼领袖的反动政策。目前领导反对工人阶级在国际规模上团结起来的，阴谋破坏世界职工联盟的，就是工党。论到“左翼政府”的口号时，高兰指出：任何新的左翼工党政府，都必须由工人运动中各个最优秀、最前进与最有战斗性的部分来组织的。许多人们都同意这点，但是如果不以经济与政治中心问题为核心来推进工人群众运动的话，那末，提出这个问题也会只是虚伪的希望。高兰接着问道：群众运动的时机是否已经成熟了？劳工是否已准备在工资问题上作斗争，并为反对上涨的物价而战呢？共产党人是否有能力团结现在反对帝国主义新反苏战争威胁的千百万人民呢？他的回答是肯定的。他说如果共产党人指出正确的道路，运动就会开展。为此，高兰强调必需清除党内一切宗派主义的残余，以达成工人阶级的团结。高兰号召在各地开展斗争，以保证工人在不久即将举行的工党会议上表示自己的意见。高兰结语力称：没有群众运动，我们就不能使政府有所改变，这是我党大会面前的中心问题。
