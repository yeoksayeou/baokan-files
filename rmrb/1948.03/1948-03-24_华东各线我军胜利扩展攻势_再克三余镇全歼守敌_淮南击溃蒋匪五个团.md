Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 22nd: A unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing into Huainan, following the victories of capturing key towns such as Tongcheng and Gucheng, has also crushed the "retaliatory mopping-up" operation by five regiments of Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Huainan were extremely panicked by our victorious advance and hastily pieced together five regiments of troops, including the Second Brigade of the Youth Army 203rd Division and the 563rd Regiment of the Gui系 (Guangxi Clique) 46th Division, and other units, and simultaneously attacked from Xuyi and Liuhe, attempting to encircle our army. On the 9th, our army completely defeated three regiments of bandits on the northern route in the Jiupu area, fifty miles southeast of Xuyi, and the remnants fled back to Xuyi city. The bandits on the southern route were terrified and also fled back to Liuhe in a panic. In this battle, a total of 287 bandits were captured alive, and over a hundred were killed or wounded. The seizures included nine mortars and small cannons, fifteen grenade launchers, thirty-four light and heavy machine guns, thirteen Canadian submachine guns, and one hundred and ninety-one long and short guns, nearly a thousand artillery shells, and tens of thousands of bullets.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 22nd: The local armed forces of the Huaibei people launched an offensive towards the outside of Sixian County. From the 16th to the 18th, they successively captured Shangdianji, @集 (could not be identified), in the suburbs of the city, and Qingyang Town, seventy miles east of the city, annihilating two enemy battalions and local bandits. The battle results are being verified.
