Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Labor strikes in Japan are now gradually spreading to all parts of the country. Following the major strikes by the Railway Workers' Union and the Osaka branch of the Transportation Workers' Union, workers of the Sendai Transportation Workers' Union went on a 24-hour strike on the 4th. Other unions that have decided to strike include the unions in Aomori and Aichi prefectures, as well as the Gifu, Wakayama, and Hokkaido branches of the National Power Station Workers' Union Committee. Representatives of government and public utility unions also decided to submit wage increase demands on the 8th, requesting the authorities to pay each worker an additional allowance of 16,725 yen for January and February. The strike by transportation workers in the Kansai region is still ongoing. It is reported that a delegation from the union surrounded government offices, put forward new conditions, demanding an additional "marriage allowance" of 16,000 yen for each unmarried transportation worker. Unless a satisfactory reply is received, members of the "Youth and Women's Department" of the government transportation workers' union will hold a sit-in strike at the Ministry of Communications (i.e., the Ministry of Transportation) offices. The union is extremely angry at the reactionary government's cruel exploitation of the Japanese working class and revealed that under the current low-wage conditions, even if young workers work until they are forty or fifty years old, they generally cannot afford to get married.

　　日本工潮蔓延全国
  　关西交通工人继续增资罢工
    【新华社陕北七日电】日本工潮现已逐渐蔓延至全国各地。继铁道工人工会及交通工会大坂分会工人的大罢工后，仙台交通工会工人已于四日进行二十四小时的罢工。其他决定罢工之工会，尚有青森、爱知两县工会，全国动力站工人工会委员会歧阜和歌山及北海道分会。政府及公用事业工会代表亦决定于八日提出增资条件，要求当局给每名工人支付一、二两月份追加津贴一万六千七百二十五日元。关西地区之交通工人罢工，仍在持续中。据悉：该工会之代表团曾包围政府办公处，提出新的条件，要求对尚未结婚的交通工人每名增发一万六千日元的“结婚津贴”，除非获得满意的答复，政府交通工人工会“青年和妇女部”会员将在递信省（即交通部）办公处举行静坐罢工。该工会对反动政府残酷剥削日本工人阶级极为愤怒，并揭露称：在目前的低薪情况下，即使工作至四五十岁时，一般青年工人亦无法结婚。
