Licheng, Zanhuang and other places pay attention to the production needs of the masses; Rectification and democracy are combined with spring plowing.
[Our newspaper news] As the Qingming Festival approaches and the time for spring plowing becomes increasingly urgent, working groups in Licheng, Zanhuang, and other places are paying attention to the production needs of the masses while leading the rectification and democratic land reform movement, stabilizing production sentiment, and combining the movement to promote spring plowing preparations. The Licheng Dongyangguan Working Group, in mobilizing poor peasants and hired laborers to understand the situation, discovered that the masses had a fear of production. Only some of the masses had begun to transport fertilizer, with most waiting to see what would happen. Mutual aid teams had not been rectified, and the thinking of middle peasants was even more uneasy. For example, Shi Shuwen said: "We didn't divide things fairly when we were long-term laborers, and now that we've bought some land, are we going to divide it up again!" Party members and cadres felt that their mistakes were great, and most were lying down and not doing anything, completely ignoring the production work in the village.... Discovering these situations, the working group immediately convened a forum for middle peasants to explain the policies, and then stated its attitude and work policy at a general meeting of the whole village. They also read the border government's proclamation on the spot, explaining that whoever sows reaps, and that everyone should feel secure in production. They also inspired everyone by supporting the front lines to dig out Chiang's roots, etc. Finally, they discussed in groups. Middle peasant Jia Shizhen said: "In the past, people said they would investigate three generations to see what class I was. They said I was a landlord, and I worried every day. Now I can relax." An old middle peasant said: "I don't understand the Land Law, and I thought there would be a big leveling. I only dared to move manure to the edge of the field. Now I understand." Poor peasant Li Jinzhu said: "I was still waiting to divide the fruits, so I didn't plan to produce." After the discussion, everyone's understanding was clear. In the afternoon, they immediately discussed and rectified mutual aid in the alleys, resolving the problems left over from last year and adjusting them under the principle of voluntariness. For example, in Guandao Nanpo Alley, with a total of seventy households, five groups have been organized, and two groups are planning to buy livestock. After the Zanhuang Zhushan Working Group arrived in the village, they saw that all classes were in turmoil. Many middle peasants were delivering manure to the fields, and poor peasants were not producing well. The phenomenon of eating, drinking, and wasting in the village was serious. The working group immediately explained the spirit of the Land Law in detail at a mass meeting, stabilized the production mood of the masses, and promoted production while visiting and mobilizing poor peasants and hired laborers. After receiving the border government's proclamation, the main village in Licheng City read it to the masses in the people's school that night, and gave a detailed explanation. Everyone unanimously said: "After hearing the proclamation, we have nothing to say. Once the seeds are sown, they will sprout, and we will harvest it ourselves. Manure and labor cannot be wasted, and besides, our village will not be affected much." Then they read the Central Committee's "Two-Two-Two Instructions" and the Central Bureau's "Two-One Instructions." Everyone's mood was even higher, and they asked to read the news of victory. They all said: "It's coming soon! It's coming soon! Let's work hard!" Finally, they decided to harrow the land before the 15th. Zhaobi Village in the third district of Xiyang is the focus of this experimental tax supplement. According to the situation, the village is a second-class village. After the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, the masses reflected: "This spring is shallow, and there is no water in the pond. This water shortage should be changed!" Some said: "The old cadres don't care anymore. Our Poor Peasants' League should unite with everyone to manage it well." After hearing these reflections, the Poor Peasants' League immediately convened a temporary mass meeting with the working group, and elected a temporary water management committee, with Lao Guisheng and five others responsible for leading and organizing water management. In the water management work, the Poor Peasants' League members showed a high degree of enthusiasm. This temporary water management committee then became the temporary organization leading production in the village. It is now rectifying mutual aid, and under the principle of re-volunteering, the masses have formed five groups. After propaganda, the production mood of the masses has become more stable. In addition, the Poor Peasants' League is carrying out its own work as usual, and the rectification of the Party, democracy, and production are combined. The masses are very happy.

　　黎城赞皇等地注意群众生产要求
  　整党民主结合春耕
    【本报消息】清明节将到，春耕时间日渐紧迫，黎城、赞皇等地工作组，在领导整党民主填补运动中，同时注意群众生产要求，安定生产情绪，结合运动推进春耕准备工作。黎城东阳关工作组在发动贫雇了解情况中，发现群众不敢生产思想，只有部分群众开始运肥，大部等待观望，互助组也未整顿，中农思想更不安，如史书文说：“咱住长工时不平分，现在买了些地又平分呀！”党员干部感到自己错误大，大部是躺倒不干，村中生产工作根本不理……。发现这些情况，工作组随即召开了中农座谈会讲明政策，又在全村大会上表明态度和工作方针，又当场读了边府布告，说明谁种谁收，大家应安心生产，又从支援前线刨蒋根等启发大家，最后分组讨论，中农贾实珍说：“以前人家说要追三代看成份，说我是地主，我天天发愁，现在可放下心了。”有个老中农说：“土地法咱也不摸底，以为要大平分，搬粪只敢搬到地口，这下可通了。”贫农李金柱说：“我还想等着分果实，就不计划生产了。”讨论后大家认识清楚，下午即分巷讨论整顿互助，解决了去年遗留问题，在自愿原则下加以调整。如关道南坡巷共七十户，已组织起五个组，有两个组正计划买牲口。赞皇竹山工作组到村后，看到各阶层动荡不安，不少中农把粪送到地头上，贫农也不好好生产，村中吃喝浪费现象严重，工作组当即在群众大会上详细讲解了土地法精神，安定了群众生产情绪，在访问发动贫雇中，同时注意推动了生产。黎城城内主村接到边府布告后，当夜即在民校念给群众听，又详细作了解释，大家一致说：“听了布告咱就没一点说的了，下了种就是抽动吧，还是自己收，粪料劳力也不能白搭，况且咱这村抽动也不会大。”接着又念了中央二、二二指示，中央局二、一指示，大家情绪更高，又要求念了胜利消息，都说：“快啦！快啦！好好干吧！”最后又决定十五前一定耙完地。昔阳三区赵壁村，是这次实验抽补的重点，据了解情况该村为二类村，在贫农团成立后，群众反映：“今年春浅，池也没水啦，这水紧该改哩！”有的说：“旧干部也不管啦，咱贫农团要和大家合起来好好管管。”贫农团听了这些反映，当即协同工作组，临时召开了个群众大会，推选出临时改水委员会，选老贵生等五人负责，领导组织改水。在改水工作中，贫农团员表现了高度的积极性。这个临时改水委员会，接着就成了村里领导生产的临时组织，现正整顿互助，在重新自愿原则下，群众已结成了五个组，又经过宣传，群众生产情绪更加安定。另外贫农团照常进行自己的工作，整党民主与生产结合进行，群众很高兴。　（玉祯、王常、有成、王喜、三虎、恩行、建勋、李青、步元、竹山工作组）
