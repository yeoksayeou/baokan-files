Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: The major case of the Qiqihar Catholic Church and the Qiqihar Diocese Headquarters, which, under the guise of evangelism, acted as Kuomintang (KMT) spies and actively engaged in sabotage, has been cracked down by the democratic government and the interrogation has come to an end. To clarify the truth, the reporter visited the spokesperson in charge, who made the following statement: Since the Northeast People's Liberation Army (formerly the Northeast Democratic Allied Army) entered Qiqihar in late April of the year before last (1946), the Public Security Bureau of Nenjiang Province has repeatedly obtained evidence that the Qiqihar Diocese Headquarters of the Catholic Church colluded with the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek, harbored secret agents and bandits, supplied ammunition and funds, disrupted social order, secretly set up radio stations, engaged in espionage, and actively prepared weapons, plotting to harm the people. After more than a year of investigation and verification, the security organs of our democratic government, in order to maintain the democratic order of the liberated areas and consolidate the rear of the war, implemented a check on the church at 5:00 am on July 24 last year. Two No. 3 pistols, 178 bullets, two packs of explosives, two rolls of American-made detonators, two military sabers, one large radio transceiver, one small radio transceiver each, one hand-cranked motor, a promissory note for 15,000 circulating notes signed by Song Guangbi, Executive Member of the KMT Heilongjiang Provincial Party Headquarters, on November 11, 1945, and several receipts signed by Zhao Tijiujiu, Secretary-General of the Nenjiang Fourth Sub-district Office of the KMT Northeast Party Affairs Commissioner's Office, on April 9, 1946, for receiving 1,413 rounds of .65 bullets were found. Also found was a copy of the 16th Circular issued by Bishop Hu Ganpu, with the church's seal, on May 16 last year, openly defying the laws and decrees of our democratic government and prohibiting church members from participating in land reform, and a copy of the draft letter to the Chief of the Police Department of Nenjiang Province of the KMT in April 1946 reporting the enticement of our army soldier Zhang Wenbing to escape and "repent and reform" to the KMT, as well as the property saved by the church for Japanese Ito (a Japanese language teacher hired by the church from Japan in 1938, who was later sent by the Japanese puppet regime to be the principal of Nehe Middle School), Zhang Bofan, the Chief of Staff of the Puppet Manchukuo Special Agent Chiang Kai-shek's Restoration Army, Long Shaoxun, a puppet police assistant, and Liu Yazhai, a KMT secret agent, and many other important stolen goods. The evidence was conclusive and unquestionable, and the church's Bishop Hu Ganpu, Office Director Bo Shide, Parish Priest Wei Youmin (all Swiss), Seminary Dean Lu Huaxing (German), Convent Dean Liu Huimu, and Church Secretary Ma Shengxiang (all Northeasterners) and other fourteen criminals were arrested and brought to justice. After numerous interrogations, the principal offenders Hu Ganpu and Bo Shide, with conclusive evidence and unable to deny, confessed to everything. A brief description of a few points is enough to reveal the severity of the espionage crimes committed by these offenders.

	I. As early as 1935, the offenders Hu, Bo, etc. colluded with the Japanese invaders, acting as fascist lackeys, organizing the so-called "Qiqihar Chinese Catholic Youth Association," waving flags and shouting everywhere, promoting "the Wangdao paradise, Japanese-Manchu cooperation." The following year, they published the monthly "Duosheng," advocating for the "Cooperation Association," undermining the Chinese anti-Japanese movement. After the "July 7th" Incident, they repeatedly held prayers and cheers for the Japanese occupation of Nanjing and the invasion of Zhanggufeng, Nomonhan, the launching of the Pacific War, and the destruction of world peace, organized nuns to sew and wash clothes for the Japanese army, launched the so-called "donation," extorting money from the people for the Japanese invaders, manufacturing munitions, slaughtering the Chinese people, actively pledging allegiance to the Japanese puppets, and implementing the Japanization of the Catholic Church, and therefore received a commendation and bonus from the "Puppet Manchukuo" Puyi in 1937, receiving special favor and being greatly "commended."

	II. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, these offenders not only did not repent but also colluded with Japanese special agents Li Ciwai and others, hiding supplies for them, and even colluded with Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province of the KMT, in February 1946, and were ordered in Qiqihar to "help the central government take over." After our army entered, they illegally harbored KMT special agent Zhang Baoshan, Secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek Longjiang County Government, Chiang Kai-shek's Peng Jiqun, the female liaison officer of the KMT Restoration Army, Guan Tanglin and Guan Zuolin sisters, the bandit chief Hua Wendong, and the captain Zhou Zuoze, and many other major bandit ringleaders, giving them church certificates, disguised as church staff, secretly sheltering and releasing them, and providing them with money and bullets.

	III. In April 1946, Bo Shide secretly set up a radio station, and repeatedly tried to contact Peng Jiqun with a 45-meter wavelength, but failed. In June of last year, he sent Father Dade to Harbin to try to communicate with Peng Jiqun in Shenyang. On the other hand, he instructed subordinates to actively detect the activities, distribution, transportation, equipment, ammunition, supplies, wounded, factories, warehouses, and the addresses of the persons in charge of various institutions of our army, reaching dozens of times. From February to June last year alone, Bo investigated the military situation in Qiqihar more than 30 times, and planned to disintegrate our army, luring our soldier Zhang Wenbing to escape.

	IV. Since the spring of last year, our Northeast People's Self-Defense War turned to the offensive, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits faced a crisis. The church was extremely anxious, spreading rumors, releasing such shameless rumors as "the central government will definitely come in the fall," "the Eighth Route Army cannot win, the central government army will win," "the Eighth Route Army is at odds with itself," using the religious hall as a place for spy barking, provoking sabotage, inciting people's hearts, madly scolding, and widely distributing its 16th Circular, slandering our just actions of land reform as "tyrannical acts," threatening church members with "retribution," prohibiting them from participating in the land reform movement, resisting and slandering the laws of our democratic government, and preventing people from joining the army, echoing with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In May, these offenders took out the military weapons they had privately hidden since "August 15th," wiping guns and removing rust, "preparing to use them." In mid-July, they once again sent people in vain to send a letter to Peng Jiqun in Shenyang, attempting to conspire to cause chaos and subvert our democratic regime in Qiqihar. All of this shows that the offenders Hu, Bo, etc. of the church, wearing religious clothes, before the "August 15th" surrender of Japan, consistently acted as accomplices, endangering the Chinese nation. After "August 15th," they willingly acted as Chiang Kai-shek bandits' spies, privately set up radio stations, detected our army's military situation, harbored bandits and special agents, spread rumors and sabotage, privately hid weapons, and plotted to poison the people. Their crimes are obvious and infuriating. Many church members who were deceived and fooled by them were filled with resentment and accused the church defendants of betraying the teachings, harboring ulterior motives, and committing unforgivable crimes, demanding that the government severely punish them. The public security organs then filed a public prosecution, and all the materials and evidence of the case were sent to the Northeast Supreme Court for legal punishment. According to the severity of the circumstances, in the current military period, they should have been sentenced to death according to military law, but considering that the offenders were all foreigners, our democratic government showed leniency and sentenced the principal offenders Hu Ganpu and Bo Shide to twelve years in prison, and the accomplices Wei Youmin, Lu Huaxing, and other ten people to fixed-term imprisonment of three to five years. Liu Huimu and other two people were released after education. The government announced that its nuns and church members were not involved in the case and would not be questioned. All church property was not touched, and the personal property of the offenders, except for the confiscation of the property hidden for the Japanese puppets, was returned in full. All original materials, weapons, and exhibits in the case, in addition to being photographed, are now properly stored for inspection.

	Finally, the spokesperson pointed out: Freedom of religious belief is one of the established policies of our democratic government and the People's Liberation Army. We protect clergy and believers, regardless of their nationality, as long as they abide by the laws and decrees of our democratic government and do not engage in illegal destructive activities. However, if anyone uses religious disguise as cover, colludes with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and foreign imperialism to engage in espionage and special agent activities, and opposes the Chinese people, once the facts are verified, the criminals must be punished according to the laws of the democratic government according to the severity of their crimes.

　　齐市天主教堂假借传教为名
　  充当蒋匪特务机关

  　姑念罪犯均系外籍仅判有期徒刑
    【新华社东北十四日电】假借传教为名、充当蒋匪间谍、积极进行阴谋破坏之齐齐哈尔市天主公教会、齐齐哈尔教区总堂大罪案，经民主政府破获，分别审讯，业已告一段落。记者为明了真相，特于日前走访负责方面发言人，承发表谈话如下：自我东北人民解放军（即前东北民主联军）于前年（一九四六年）四月下旬进驻齐齐哈尔市后，我嫩江省公安机关即迭获天主公教会该市教区总堂，勾结日蒋，窝藏特务胡匪，接济弹药经费，破坏社会安宁，秘密架设电台，从事间谍活动，并积极准备武器，图谋危害人民等种种罪行材料，经年余之各方侦查证实，因此我民主政府治安机关为维护解放区之民主秩序，巩固战争后方，乃于去年七月二十四日晨五时对该堂实行检查，当即搜出三号手枪两支、子弹一七八发、炸药两包、美制雷管两盘、军刀两把、大型电台收发报机一部、小型电台收发报机各一部、手摇马达一套，蒋匪特务国民党黑龙江省党部执行委员宋光弼署名于民国三十四年十一月十一日借用流通券一万五千元，及国民党东北党务专员办事处嫩江第四区分部书记长赵悌九署名于民国三十五年四月九日收到六五子弹一千四百一十三发等单据数种，该堂主教胡干普盖章于去年五月十六日印发公开违抗我民主政府法令禁止教民参加土地改革之第十六号通令一份，民国三十五年四月致国民党嫩江省警务处长报告诱惑我军战士张文炳逃跑后向国民党“悔过自新”之公函底稿一份，以及该堂为日寇伊藤（民国二十七年该堂自日本延聘之日语教师，后被日伪派为讷河中学校长），伪满特务蒋匪光复军旅参谋长张伯藩，伪警佐龙绍勋，国特刘亚斋等保存之财物等等许多重要赃证。证据确凿，无容置疑，遂将该堂之主教胡干普，事务主任博施德，本堂神父魏佑民（以上均瑞士人），修道院院长陆化行（德国人），修女院院长刘会母，天主堂秘书马盛祥（以上系东北人）等十四名罪犯逮捕归案。经多次审讯，主犯胡干普、博施德等以证据确凿，无法狡赖，均一一供认不讳。兹略述数点，即可窥见该犯等间谍罪行之深重。
    一、远在民国二十四年，该堂胡、博等犯即与日寇勾结，充当法西斯走卒，组织所谓“齐市中华公教青年会”，到处摇旗呐喊，宣传“王道乐土，日满协和”。次年更出版“铎声”月刊，为“协和会”张目，破坏中国抗日运动。“七七”事变后，则历次为日寇占领我国南京及侵犯张鼓峰、诺门坎、发动太平洋战争、破坏世界和平而举行祈祷欢呼，组织修女给日军缝洗衣服，发动所谓“献金”，替日寇勒索民财，制造军火，屠杀中国人民，积极效忠日伪，实行天主堂日伪化，因而于民国二十六年获得“伪满傀儡”溥仪之奖状与奖金，优宠有加，大为“表扬”。
    二、日寇投降后，该犯等不仅不知改悔，仍于日特李次外二等串连，为之隐匿物资，且竟于民国三十五年二月与蒋匪嫩江省主席彭济群勾结，在齐市受命“帮助中央接收”。在我军进驻后，则非法窝藏国民党特务蒋记龙江县政府秘书张宝山、蒋匪彭济群、特工兼蒋匪光复军女联络员关塘林关作林姊妹、土匪大队长华文东、队长周作泽等罪魁巨匪多人，给以教堂证明，伪装教堂职员，秘密掩护放行，并予金钱子弹接济。
    三、民国三十五年四月由博施德秘密设置电台，以四十五米波长与彭济群试验联络多次未果，乃于去年六月派遣神父达得普至哈尔滨活动，企图与沈阳彭济群通信。另一面更指使从属积极侦探我军活动、分布、运输、装备、弹药、给养、伤员、工厂、仓库及各机关组织机构负责人住址等情况，先后达数十次，仅去年二月至六月，博犯即调查我齐市一地军队情况三十余次，并策谋瓦解我军，引诱我战士张文炳逃跑等。
    四、自去春以后，我东北人民自卫战争转为进攻，蒋匪面临危局，该堂则焦灼万分，大肆造谣，放出什么“中央秋天一定要来”，“八路军胜不了，中央军要胜利”，“八路军自己和自己不和”等无耻谣言，借宗教之礼堂作间谍犬吠之场所，挑拨破坏，煽惑人心，疯狂谩骂，普遍散发其第十六号通令，诬蔑我土地改革之正义行动为“暴虐行为”，以“将受报复”威吓教民，不准参加土改运动，抗拒诋毁我民主政府法令，阻止人民参军等等，与蒋匪互相呼应。五月，该犯等则将自“八一五”后，即私藏之军火武器起出，擦枪去锈，“准备使用”。七月中旬，又一次派人妄想去沈阳给彭济群送信，企图阴谋作乱，颠覆我齐市民主政权。凡此种种，以身穿教服之该堂胡、博等犯，在“八一五”日本投降前，既一贯为虎作伥，危害中华民族，“八一五”后，又甘作蒋匪间谍，私设电台，侦探我军军情，窝藏匪特，造谣破坏，私藏武器，阴谋荼毒人民，罪恶昭彰，令人震怒，许多受其愚弄欺骗之教民，均愤懑填应，纷起控诉该堂案犯之罪行，以彼等背悖教义，心怀叵测，罪不容诛，要求政府严厉处置。旋由公安机关提起公诉，将该案犯材料证据一并解送东北最高法院依法治罪。按其情节之严重，在目前军事时期，原应按军法处以极刑，惟姑念该犯等均系外籍人，本我民主政府宽大为怀，判处主犯胡干普、博施德徒刑十二年，从犯魏佑民、陆化行等十名各判三年以上五年以下之有期徒刑，刘会母等二人经教育释放，对其修女教民已由政府宣布与此案无关，一律不问。该堂教产一概不动，各犯私有财产，除代日伪隐藏之逆产予以没收外，一律如数发还，至全案材料武器证物除摄成照片外，原件现均妥存备查。
    最后发言人指出：信教自由，是我民主政府与人民解放军的既定政策之一，我们对于教士教徒，不论其国籍如何，只要他们遵守我民主政府法令，不作非法破坏活动，一律予以保护，但如有利用宗教伪装掩护，勾结蒋介石匪帮与外国帝国主义从事间谍特务活动，反对中国人民者，一经查明属实，必须依照民主政府法律对其犯罪分子分别轻重治罪。
