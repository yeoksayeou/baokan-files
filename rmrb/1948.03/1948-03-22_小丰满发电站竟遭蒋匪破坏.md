Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yongji fled, they disregarded the repeated warnings from the People's Liberation Army and sabotaged the Xiaofengman Power Station. They dismantled important components, rendering the power generation equipment unable to continue operating. As a result, the water within the dam could not be discharged as usual, and the water level increased daily. Currently, the democratic government has dispatched capable staff to work day and night to repair the damage. Whether the danger can be averted remains to be seen. If misfortune occurs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who carried out the sabotage will bear full responsibility for the serious consequences.

    小丰满发电站竟遭蒋匪破坏
    【新华社东北二十日电】永吉蒋匪逃窜时，不顾解放军的历次警告，将小丰满发电站加以破坏，拆走重要机件，使发电机器不能继续发电，以致堤内积水不能照常排泄，水位逐日增高，现民主政府正派得力员工昼夜抢修，能否化险为夷，未可预料，如有不幸，其严重后果，当由施行破坏的蒋匪负其全责。
