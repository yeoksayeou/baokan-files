Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Taiwan News: The collusion between Chiang Kai-shek and the US in Taiwan has led to the implementation of a serf-like rule over the peasants. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in Taiwan have forcibly occupied "public land," reaching 72% of the total land in the province. Among these, 2,559,748 hectares have been organized into "cooperative farms." Last July, the US imperialists utilized the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's machinery and personnel to form a "Mechanized Command Headquarters" in Taiwan, directly controlling these "farms." The headquarters of this "Command Headquarters" is located in Pingtung, with three regional work groups established in Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. UNRRA American agricultural reclamation consultant Dale R. Wright personally went to Taiwan to be responsible for training the farmers on the "cooperative farms." The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan also exploit the peasants through the "public land leasing" method. Anyone who contracts "public land" must pay 25% of the land rent to the Chiang Kai-shek official authorities every year, and other surplus grain can also be requisitioned at any time. The Chiang Kai-shek official authorities admit that there are a total of 107,671 tenant households in the province, accounting for one-fifth of all farming households in Taiwan. As for the land of general owner-farmers, it is also arbitrarily forcibly incorporated into the "farms."

　　台湾蒋美勾结横行
  　强占土地剥夺农民
    【新华社陕北三日】台湾消息：蒋美勾结在台实行农奴统治。台省蒋匪当局强占“公地”，达全省土地百分七十二。其中二、五五九、七四八公顷被组成为“合作农场”。去年七月间美帝即利用联总机械与人员在台组成“机械化指挥部”，直接控制这些“农场”。该“指挥部”总部设于屏东，另在台中、台南、高雄设立三个分区工作团。联总美籍农垦顾问戴乐义亲至台负责训练“合作农场”的农民。蒋匪在台并利用“公地放租”办法剥夺农民，凡承领“公地”者，每年须向蒋匪官方缴纳地租百分之二十五，其他剩余粮食亦可随时被征发，蒋匪官方供认，全省承耕户共一○七、六七一户，占全台农户五分之一。至于一般自耕农的土地，也被任意强制并入“农场”。
