Allocates Grain to Help Salt Farmers Repair Salt Fields

The salt farmers on the east coast of Jiaodong are actively repairing salt fields to prepare for salt production. Before the Spring Festival, the Shidao Municipal Salt Industry Company allocated a total of 286,000 jin of grain in the Renhe and Jinghai districts of Shidao and the Huanhai district of Wendeng to purchase edible salt. Another 900,000 jin of grain was allocated to solve the problems of food and tools for salt farmers repairing salt fields. The Wuliu District Salt Office allocated 65,900 jin. The salt area managed by the company extends 280 li from Jiangjiagang in Rongcheng County in the east to Wulei Island in Wendeng in the west, with approximately 26,000 mu of salt fields. Salt farmers are currently repairing ponds, dams, and canals, and building new salt fields to increase salt production. In the salt villages of Wuliu Village and Yuejiashan alone, more than 280 mu of new salt fields have been repaired. Furthermore, at Shuangdao Port, about 40 li west of Weihai, salt farmers are also actively repairing the salt fields that were destroyed by the heavy floods last year, and are studying improved techniques. The Zhou family of Taishang has researched a method of releasing fresh water from the salt ditches during rainfall, which results in a large yield of salt blocks. The Jiangjia Village has researched methods to increase the salinity of salt water.

  　拨粮帮助盐民修滩
    【新华社华东十六日电】胶东东海岸盐民积极修滩准备晒盐。石岛市盐业公司，春节前在石岛人和、靖海两区和文登环海区共拨粮二十八万六千斤订购食盐。另拨粮九十万斤，解决盐民修滩之口粮及工具等困难。五柳区盐所拨出六万五千九百斤。该公司所管理的盐区，东起荣成县姜家港，西至文登五垒岛二百八十里，盐田约二万六千亩。盐民现正修池、修坝、修渠，并另建新滩以增加盐产。仅五柳村、岳家山等盐村即已修新滩二百八十余亩。又威海西约四十里之双岛港，盐民亦积极抢修去年大水冲毁的盐田，并研究改良技术。台上周家研究出在下雨时放出盐沟淡水，则出盐块产量大。姜家村研究出增加盐水成份等办法。
