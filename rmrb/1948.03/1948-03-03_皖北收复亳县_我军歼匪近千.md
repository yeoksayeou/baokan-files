Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 1st: On the morning of February 21st, the Liberation Army, in a two-hour battle with only over twenty casualties, recaptured Bo County in northern Anhui, eliminating nearly a thousand enemies. A total of 878 people were captured, including Chiang Kai-shek's Bo County Magistrate Yao Dongmin, Bo County Security Regiment Commander Ma Yunxiu, and four district chiefs of the county. Over a hundred bandits were killed, and the following were seized: two mortars, sixteen light machine guns, one grenade launcher, 530 rifles and pistols, and seventy war horses.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 29th: The value of the local currency in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu liberated area is rising daily. On February 14th and 15th, the exchange rate between the local currency and Chiang currency in the First Sub-district market rose from 1:20 or 1:30 to 1:45 (Chiang). The masses in Sui County, Zhe County, Taikang and other counties refused to use Chiang currency. In the area south of Dangshan in the Third Sub-district, fifty yuan of Chiang currency could not even be exchanged for one yuan of local currency. During the period when Lanfeng was occupied by Chiang bandits, the local currency continued to circulate inside and outside the city as usual. In the newly liberated area on the south bank of the Sha River, as early as January, the ratio between the local currency and the Chiang currency had reached 1 to 40.

　　皖北收复亳县
    我军歼匪近千
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线一日电】解放军二月二十一日晨以两小时战斗，伤亡仅二十余的代价再度攻克皖北亳县城，歼敌近千。计生俘蒋匪亳县县长姚东敏、亳县保安团长马允修及该县四个区长以下八七八人、毙匪百余名、缴获迫击炮二门、轻机枪十六挺、掷弹筒一个、长短枪五三○支、战马七十匹。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十九日电】豫皖苏解放区本币价值日高。二月十四、十五两日，一分区市场本币与蒋币比值，已由一比二十、一比三十上升到一比四十五（蒋）。睢县、＠县、太康等县群众都拒绝使用蒋币。三分区砀山以南地区蒋币五十元还换不到一元本币。兰封在蒋匪侵占期间本币照旧在市内外流通。新解放之沙河南岸地区，早在一月份，本币与蒋币即已达一与四十之比。
