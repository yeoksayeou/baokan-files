　　After Batch-by-Batch Connection and Mutual Review
　　Zhao Village Poor Peasant League Is Officially Established

　　[This Newspaper's Report] Zhao Village, Ninth District, Wu'an, after visiting poor peasants and hired farmhands, undergoing a period of open connection, and initially classifying class status, the poor peasants and hired farmhands who had not thoroughly turned themselves over felt an extremely urgent need to establish their own core organization. Therefore, on February 10th (the first day of the Lunar New Year), the Poor Peasant League was formally established. The establishment of the Poor Peasant League was a major event in the reorganization of the peasant ranks in Zhao Village. The league had a total of 219 members and was organized in two phases. The first batch of 119 people was connected after being initiated by 25 people at a public Party village meeting on the 3rd. After a mutual review by the members, 6 people were removed, leaving 113 people. The admission conditions for this batch of members were relatively strict: in addition to the obvious condition of "being a poor peasant," there were also "four wants and six don'ts." The four wants were: to be a long-term laborer, to be upright, to be selfless, and to be enthusiastic about doing things for everyone. The six don'ts were: no double-dealing, no political problems, no hooligans, no embezzlers, no speculators, and no oppressors. These conditions were summarized from the opinions of the Poor Peasant League members, who also voluntarily proposed: to choose the best from the good. The work team felt that this kind of closed-doorism was not good at the time, but because it was difficult to reverse, they temporarily did so and expanded after the organization was established.

　　The mutual review of the first batch of members was held collectively on the evening of February 3rd. At the beginning, people were not straightforward and were unwilling to hurt feelings. When mentioning people who everyone was satisfied with, there was a quick "good person," "no opinion," and it passed very smoothly. When mentioning people who everyone had opinions about, no one said anything. They took things very seriously, but were unwilling to speak directly. When they couldn't hold back, someone would say, "Everyone should carefully consider this person!" or "Ask the street initiator to talk about this person." After repeated encouragement to speak frankly, they would only vaguely say "slippery" or "shifting the blame." Those who didn't pass were temporarily set aside and they moved on. Halfway through the review, the speech gradually became more straightforward. Who was a hooligan, who was engaging in illicit affairs, who was lazy and didn't work, who was not a laborer, were all brought up. Someone mentioned that Meng XX (a young man) was fond of women and didn't work hard, saying, "Ask him to stand up and talk about it himself." The young man stood up with a red face and stammered, "I just have a little bit... I'll change; if I can't change, you can deal with me as you see fit." The introducer said, "He's still young, let him change; if he can't change, we don't want him." Everyone agreed and temporarily kept him. The most intense criticism was directed at Li XX, who was developed by the fifth street. This person had previously promoted that "the Central Government (Chiang bandit) is coming up soon, and the Eighth Route Army is failing." The village said that he had political problems and was a big running dog of the landlord. When this name was mentioned during the review, the old man Zhao Duixi shouted, "What are the fifth street initiators doing! Why introduce this person? A house, the foundation hasn't been laid yet, and you're piling things on top of it, who will be responsible when it collapses?" The crowd also roared, and one of the initiators from the fifth street said, "I made it clear on the street that Li Quanzi's political problems have been resolved!" Others immediately asked, "How was it resolved, are you responsible?" Li Quanzi stammered and couldn't shirk responsibility, so he had to admit his mistake. As a result of the review, out of the original 119 people, more than 10 people were criticized, and 6 of them could not temporarily join the Poor Peasant League, pending detailed review. For others with minor problems, everyone told them to correct them as soon as possible, and if they didn't correct them, they wouldn't be wanted. There were six types of criticisms raised: First, chaotic sexual relations: In the countryside, many poor peasants did not have wives, so this kind of thing was quite common, but they were basically against乱搞(disorderly conduct), and they were also very unhappy with the sexual disorder of the cadres. Second, gluttony and laziness. Third, social connections with bad cadres, afraid of leakage. Fourth, willingness to gossip and spread rumors. Fifth, staring and unreasonable speech. Sixth, political problems. The first and second types of problems were raised the most, indicating that these people attached great importance to long-term labor and upright behavior, which is the true color of laborers. But from the problem of Li XX, they were most concerned about the issue of political purity. Some people say that these honest people only know economic interests, which is not correct. But why were these people still introduced? There are three reasons: (1) Some initiators were muddled in their thinking and did not distinguish between boundaries; (2) Some were afraid that they would have too few people and little power, and wanted to attract more people; (3) Some initiators were afraid of offending people themselves and wanted others to criticize. For example, Xue XX, a soldier who returned from the front line in the fourth street, was fond of women, liked to stare and use cunning, and was temporarily back from the army, not often at home. The initiator was unwilling to let him participate, but after repeated discussions, he was still allowed to join. Although they looked bad when they were criticized by other streets at the conference, they were satisfied in their hearts: Xue XX was cancelled, and they did not offend anyone. This aspect still needs to be well-educated.

　　After the first batch of member review meetings, two situations occurred. One was that someone threatened to sabotage: The aforementioned Xue XX, because someone criticized him at the review meeting, ran to the home of the person who made the criticism after the meeting to threaten and intimidate him, saying, "I have more than a hundred people, you be careful; I admit that I am a hooligan, but I won't admit anything else!" The threatened member ran to the work team and cried. After comforting and explaining, and stating that anyone who interfered would be punished, he was stabilized. Later, the work team immediately warned Xue XX and told him to personally apologize and admit his mistake before the matter was over. After the incident, the work team studied and concluded that it was correct to resolutely support him at that time and not consider it to be a matter of interference. The matter was also spread throughout the village. The other situation was that poor peasants who were not absorbed were uneasy: Some people said, "There is no us in the middle peasants, and the Poor Peasant League doesn't want us, what are we?" Most of these people had some minor problems and had offended the masses. Some of them were obviously dissatisfied because they were not allowed to join the league, and most of them felt ashamed and tried their best to correct themselves in order to participate in the future.

　　If this situation continued, the Poor Peasant League would be in danger of being isolated, so after a review of Party members by the Poor Peasant League in the middle, the work team persuaded everyone to quickly connect with more poor peasants to join the league and expand the Poor Peasant League. During the connection, most of them could accept this opinion, and there was not much ideological resistance. Most of them also welcomed the 15 Party members who had been approved, and all 10 Party members from poor peasant backgrounds joined the league. However, Li Zhong and Li Gouzi were unwilling to be absorbed because of their consistent bad attitudes, fearing that joining the league would oppress people. After everyone's research, it was clarified that they had the power to supervise his transformation, and that even if they had made minor mistakes in the past, they should be welcomed as long as they could change in the future (of course, they must abide by the rules of the Poor Peasant League). Some poor peasants said, "Choose good beams on old houses, good is still good." They did not exclude Party members across the board.

　　By February 9th (New Year's Eve), another 106 new members had been developed, including 44 women. During the development period, in addition to educating new members through individual talks, the streets also gathered separately on the evening of the 8th to mutually review the second batch of members. Because these people were eager to join the league, they naturally launched a self-criticism movement, and everyone talked about their past mistakes and shortcomings, expressing their determination to correct them. Among the new members of the Third Street who had not been very harmonious in the past, the knots were untied when they joined the league, and both sides expressed that they would unite well in the future, and those who did not speak to each other in the past now spoke out. In addition, two direct preparatory tasks were done for the establishment of the Poor Peasant League. One was: after deliberation and discussion by the members of each street and a formal meeting of the 25 initiators, 31 candidates for the Poor Peasant League Committee were carefully elected. The other was that after repeated research by the members, the constitution of the Poor Peasant League and the oath of the committee members were drafted. The constitution generally has the following eight articles: (1) The Poor Peasant League is an organization of our poor peasants, hired farmhands, workers, and the poor. (2) Support the Communist Party, unite with the middle peasants to be masters of the house, and thoroughly turn themselves over. (3) Resolutely implement the Outline Land Law, redistribute land and level the land. (4) Implement democracy, transform various organizations in the village, and ask them to do things for everyone. (5) Poor peasants, hired farmhands, workers, and the poor, regardless of gender, who are willing to join the Poor Peasant League, find a member to introduce them, pass the group, and be approved by the committee. (6) When there are seven to ten members, a group can be established, and a group leader and deputy group leader are elected to lead the group meetings and do things. (7) A general meeting of all members is held once a month. At the meeting, 15 members are elected to form the Poor Peasant League Committee to lead the entire league. The election is held once a year. Bad ones can be removed at any time at the members' meeting. (8) All members must abide by the following rules. Those who violate the rules will be criticized for minor offenses and expelled for serious offenses: First, it is not allowed to protect landlords and rich peasants. Second, obey the leadership, work actively, and do not deliberately fail to attend meetings. Third, it is not allowed to form small cliques, protect each other, and cause contradictions. Fourth, it is not allowed to be selfish, corrupt, and occupy more of the fruits of the struggle. Fifth, the attitude should be amiable, and it is not allowed to look down on people, or oppress people. The committee oath has the following sentences: "Everyone elected us to lead, we must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, sincerely do things according to everyone's opinions, unite with the middle peasants to implement the Land Law, never protect landlords and rich peasants, never learn from bad cadres to oppress people, be selfish, or form small cliques to protect each other, and cause contradictions. If we commit these things, we are willing to be punished by everyone."

　　The founding meeting on the 10th (the first day of the Lunar New Year) was particularly lively. Gongs, drums, reeds, pipes, and trumpets all came. The work team helped write some slogans, which were pasted all over the venue in red and green. Everyone played imperial music to hold the meeting. The presidium (5 people) elected by everyone presided over the meeting themselves. After paying tribute to Chairman Mao and observing a moment of silence for the martyrs, the new members of each street and the constitution of the Poor Peasant League were passed. Because of the mature deliberation beforehand, everyone did not have any major opinions on the new members and the constitution, and they were quickly passed. When electing the committee members, the list of 31 candidates written in large characters was read twice, and then the election method decided by everyone—raising their fists—was used (it is said that the past method of throwing beans had shortcomings, because the names could not be recognized, and the first few names they encountered were thrown under those names).

　　During the election, the members generally showed that they had their own ideas. Of the 31 people, the election of the 15 people was all considered. When this person was mentioned, there was a bang and many fists were raised, and when another person was mentioned, there were very few. But a few people still insisted on their rights and were not timid. More than 20 people in the first street were sitting together, and one person once raised his hand for a candidate in isolation. He saw that no one else raised his hand, and was a little embarrassed, and lowered his head, but his fist was still raised high, and he only lowered it when the vote counters counted.

　　Another feature is that the members collectively expressed that they had no prejudice against old Party members. As long as they were good individuals, everyone took a welcoming attitude, and there was no sectarian exclusion. The number of votes for the poor peasant Party member Zhao Fushan (former deputy village chief) was the highest number of votes among all candidates (145 votes). His characteristics are that he works particularly well, is not special, and does not have the airs of a cadre when he is a cadre.

　　The third characteristic is that honest and fair suffering people are most supported. The old farmhand Guo Suozi, who still herds sheep for the cooperative, was also elected with 123 votes. The reason is that he is very honest and fair, and he wants to argue with you face to face about unfair events; he is not selfish in doing things, and he is diligent, and the neighbors have to treat him right. Those who engaged in sectarianism in the past were not elected.

　　But this meeting also has shortcomings: One is that there was no detailed introduction to the candidates beforehand, and people who were far away from each other did not understand each other, which reduced the number of votes that should have been cast. Several candidates were raised more by people from their own street and nearby, and less by people from far away. Second, women were generally very serious, but because they were not mobilized enough and not trained enough, some were just following the crowd, and they raised their hands when the men raised them. They put their hands next to their ears, and they looked like they were raising them, and they didn't look like they were raising them. Two women even went back to cook before the meeting was over.

　　Overall, this meeting was successful. Because most people were satisfied with the elected committee members (15 official members, 3 alternate members). The fourth street reflected: "If it had been this democratic earlier, the work would have been done better." "This group of people will never be bad, they will never dare to oppress people again in the future!"

　　经过分批串连相互审查
  　赵庄贫农团正式成立
    【本报消息】武安九区赵庄村，经过访问贫雇与一段公开串连过程并初步划阶级后，翻身不彻底的贫雇农，对成立自己骨干组织的要求，极为迫切，乃于二月十号（旧历大年初一）正式成立贫农团。贫农团的成立，是赵庄整编农民队伍的一件大事，团员共二百一十九人，是分两个段落组织起来的。第一批一百一十九人，是在公开党的村民大会上经二十五人发起后至三号串连的。经过一次团员相互审查，取消了六人，剩一百一十三人。这一批团员的入团条件比较严格：除过“是贫农”这个当然条件外，还附加有“四要六不要”。四要是：要长年劳动的，要为人正派的，要大公无私的，要热心为大家办事的。六不要是：两面烧饼不要，有政治问题不要，流氓不要，贪污分子不要，投机分子不要，好压迫人的不要。这些条件都是贫农团员意见归纳出来的，他们并自动提出：要在好的里头挑好的。工作组当时觉得这种关门主义情绪不好，但因不好扭转，就暂时这样做，等组织起来以后再扩展。
    第一批团员的相互审查是在二月三日黄昏集体举行的。开始时，说话不爽直，打不破情面。提到大家都满意的人时，喳啦一声“好人”、“没意见”，骨骨格格（干脆）就过去了。提到大家有意见的人时，不吭气。他们心里把事情看得很大，但不愿直说。蹩不住了，才有人说：“这个人大家可好好考虑考虑呀！”或是说：“叫他街发起人说说这个人。”再三鼓励直说，才笼统说出个“滑头”，或“流动差池”。通不过的暂时搁起，往下走。审查到中间，发言就慢慢直爽了。谁有点流氓，搞破鞋，谁好吃不动，荒了地，谁不是劳动人，都提出来了。有人提到孟××（青年）好搞女人、劳动不好时说：“叫他自己起来说说。”这青年红着脸站起来，吞吞吐吐说：“我就是有一点……我改；如果改不了，大家该怎处理怎处理。”介绍人说：“他还年轻哩，叫他改，改不了咱不要。”大家同意，暂时留下。提意见最激烈的是对五街发展的李××。这个人过去宣传过“中央（蒋匪）快上来了，八路快不行了”，村里说他有政治问题，是地主大走狗。审查时一提到这个名字，老汉赵对喜就嚷起来：“五街发起人干的啥呀！为啥介绍这个人？一座房子，根脚还没打好，你们就乱往上堆，轰隆一声塌下来谁负责任呀？”全场群众也哄嚷起来，五街一个发起人说：“俺在街上就揭明啦，李全子人家说政治问题已经解决啦！”别人马上问：“怎解决的，负责任不？”李全子吞吞吐吐推不掉责任，只好认错。审查结果，原来一一九人中间，有十多人受到指责，其中六人暂时不能进贫农团，等详细审查。其他人，毛病小的，大家叫他们赶快改正，不改正就不要了。提出的批评意见有六种：一是性生活乱：在农村中，贫农没老婆的很多，这类事也就相当多，但他们基本上是反对乱搞的，对干部的性乱，他们也很不高兴。二是好吃懒做，三是与坏干部有社会联系，怕透气，四是肯翻闲话，播弄是非，五是说话瞪眼不讲理，六是政治问题。其中一、二两种问题提出的最多，说明这些人把长年劳动、为人正派看得很重，这是劳动者的本色。但从李××的问题上看，他们最注意的还是政治上纯洁的问题。有人说这些老实人只知道经济利益，这是不对的。但是为什么这些人还有人介绍呢？原因有三：（一）有个别发起人思想糊涂，不分界限；（二）有的怕自己人少势力小，想多拉些人；（三）有的发起人自己不敢得罪人，想叫别人去批评。比如四街从前方回来的一个战士薛××，好搞女人，好瞪眼使利害，又是部队临时回来的，不常在家，发起人并不愿意叫他参加，但再三讨论后，还是叫进来了。他们在大会上受了别街批评，虽然不好看，但心里满意：把薛××取消了，自己又没有惹下人。这方面还得好好教育。
    第一批团员审查会以后发生两种情况，一是有人威胁破坏：前面说的薛××，因为审查会上有人批评了他，他就在会后跑到提意见人家里去诈唬说：“我有一百多人哩，你防着吧；说我流氓我承认，说别的不行！”受威胁团员跑到工作组就哭起来，经过安慰解释，说明谁干涉就要处治他，这才稳住。后来工作组马上警告了薛××，叫他亲自上门赔了罪认了错才完事。事后工作组研究，当时这样断然撑腰是正确的，不算包办。并将此事传到全村。另一种情况，是没有吸收的贫农不安：有人说：“中农里面没有咱，贫农团不要咱，咱算个什么呀！”这些人多半都有些小毛病和得罪群众的地方。其中有些人因为没有入团，带有明显的不满，大部分是自感惭愧，极力想改正自己，将来参加。
    这种情况如果延续下去，贫农团有孤立的危险，所以在中间经过一次贫农团审查党员后，工作组就说服大家赶快再去串连更多的贫农来入团，扩大贫农团。串连中间，他们大部分可以接受这个意见，思想抵抗不多，对已通过的十五个党员也大部欢迎，十个贫农出身的党员都入了团，但李忠、李狗子两人因一向态度不好，大家怕入团压人，不愿吸收。经过大家研究，弄清自己有力量监督他转变过来，而且，他们过去虽然有了小错，只要以后能改，还应该欢迎，吸收他们（当然他们必须服从贫农团规矩）。有的贫农说：“旧房上挑好梁，好的还是好的。”他们并不一律排斥党员。
    到二月九日（除夕），又发展了一○六个新团员，其中有四十四个妇女。发展期间，除个别谈话要教育新团员外，并在八号晚上各街分别集会互相审查了第二批团员，这批人因为争着想入团，自自然然展开了一个自我批评运动，各人都谈明自己过去有过什么错误、缺点，表示决心改正。三街新团员当中过去不大和睦的，入团时进行了解圪瘩，双方都表示以后要好好团结，过去互相不说话的现在也说开了。另外还做了两件成立贫农团的直接准备工作。一件是：经过各街团员酝酿讨论与二十五个发起人正式会议，慎重推选出三十一个贫农团委员候选人。另一件是经过团员们大家反复研究，草拟了贫农团的章程与委员誓词。章程大致有以下八条：（一）贫农团是咱们贫农、雇农、工人、贫民的组织。（二）拥护共产党，跟中农团结起来当家做主，彻底闹翻身。（三）坚决实行土地法大纲，抽肥补瘦，抽多补少，把圪道填平。（四）实行民主，改造村里各种组织，叫他们给大家办事。（五）贫农、雇农、工人、贫民，不论男女，愿意参加贫农团的，找一个团员介绍，小组通过，委员会批准。（六）有了七个到十个团员就可以成立小组，选出正副组长，领导小组开会办事。（七）全体团员大会一月开一次。在会上选出十五个委员成立贫农团委员会，领导全团办事。一年一选。坏的可以在团员大会上随时撤换。（八）团员都要遵守下面几条规矩，犯了规矩，轻的批评，重的开除：第一、不准包庇地主、富农。第二、服从领导，积极工作，开会不准故意不到。第三、不准结小团体，互相包庇，自己起矛盾。第四、不准自私自利，贪污腐化，多占斗争果实。第五、态度要和气，不准看上不看下，压迫人。委员誓词有以下几句：“大家选举我们来领导，我们一定要在共产党领导下，实心实意照大家的意见办事，团结中农实行土地法，决不包庇地主富农，决不学坏干部的样欺压人，自私自利，决不结小团体互相包庇，自己起矛盾。如果犯了这些事，愿意受大家的处罚。”
    十号（大年初一）开成立大会，特别热闹。锣鼓笙管喇叭都来了。工作组帮助写了些标语，红红绿绿贴满会场。大家吹打着朝廷出台的音乐来开会。由大家选出的主席团（五人）自己主持。经过向毛主席致敬及向死难烈士致默后，即开始通过各街新的团员与贫农团章程。由于事前酝酿成熟，大家对新团员与章程没什么大的意见，很快就通过了。选举委员时，首先把大字写出的三十一个候选人名单读过两遍，然后用大家决定的选举办法——举拳头来进行选举（据说过去的投豆子办法有缺点，因为认不清名字，先碰到那几个人名就投到那几个人名下去了）。
    选举中，团员们一般都表现了自己很有主意。三十一人中，选举那十五人，都是有考虑的。念到这个人，轰的一声举起很多拳头，念到另一个人，则寥寥无几。但少数人仍坚持自己的权利，并不胆怯。第一街二十多人坐在一片，曾经有一个人孤立的给一个候选人举手。他看见别人都不举，有点不好意思，把头低了下去，但拳头仍高高举着，等查票人数了才放下。
    另一特点，是集中的表现了团员们对旧党员完全不抱成见。只要他们个人好，大家就采取欢迎态度，没有宗派式的排挤。贫农党员赵福山（原副村长）的票数，竟是所有候选人中的最高票数（一百四十五票）。他的特点是劳动特别好，不特殊，当干部也没架子。
    第三个特点，是老实公正的受苦人最受拥护。老长工郭锁子，至今还给合作社放羊，也以一百二十三票当选。原因就是他非常老实公正，对不平事件要和你当面争执；办事不自私，又勤劳，街坊邻舍都要对得住。过去闹宗派的，一个也没选上。
    但这个大会也有缺点：一个是事前对各候选人没有详细介绍，离远的互相不了解，减少了应有票数。有几个候选人，给他们举手的是本街和附近的人多，离远的就举手少。二、妇女中，一般说来也很认真，但由于发动不够，锻炼不够，有一些是随大流，看汉们举就举。自己把手放在耳边，也象举，也象不举。有两个妇女甚至一直没有举手。还有几个妇女不等散会就回去做饭去了。
    总的说来，这个会是成功的。因为选出来的委员（正式委员十五，候补委员三）多数人都很满意。四街方面反映：“要早这样民主，早把工作都搞好了。”“这批人永坏不了，他们以后万不敢再压迫人！”
