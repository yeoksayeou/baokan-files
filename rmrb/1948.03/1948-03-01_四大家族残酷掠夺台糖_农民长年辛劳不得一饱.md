Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th -- Taipei News: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Four Families' monopolized Taiwan sugar industry's sugar company cruelly exploits farmers throughout the province. The company owns thirty-six factories, distributed throughout Taiwan province, occupying or controlling over 8.7 million mu of sugarcane farmland, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total cultivated land area of Taiwan, which is over 13 million mu (planting sugarcane for one year requires a two-year break before replanting; generally, rice is planted during these two years). Chiang Kai-shek bandits have completely inherited the mantle of colonial slave rule over the Taiwanese people from the Japanese invaders. This year, the total sugarcane planting area is nearly 6 million mu, and farmers are forced to hand over all sugarcane harvests to Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan Sugar Company. According to the company's plundering "sugar distribution method," for refined sugar products, "the company gets 50%," and "of the sugar farmers receive, one-twentieth is allocated as in-kind payment," with the remainder forcibly purchased at low prices by Chiang Kai-shek's company to supply Japan and be trafficked domestically for high-price sales. The vast majority of farmers suffer exploitation, toiling for years without enough to eat.

    Another dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government has signed a contract with MacArthur's US military headquarters in Tokyo to supply Japan with 25,000 tons of Taiwan sugar, and Japanese ships are allowed to transport it themselves. The Japanese ship Chang Maru is scheduled to arrive in Kaohsiung on the 18th to load the cargo.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th -- Taiwan News: Chiang and the US now own 22 large monopoly companies in Taiwan, seizing all of the province's light and heavy industries and mining. These include sugar, alkali, paper, cement, fertilizer, machinery shipbuilding, coal, electrical engineering, iron and steel machinery, chemicals, rubber, glass, textiles, oils and fats, kilns, printing, engineering, industrial and mining equipment, oil refining, aluminum, and copper mines, totaling 392 factories and workshops.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th -- Nanjing News: The Four Families' highest financial dictatorship organization, the "Joint Administration," held a "Board Meeting" on the 21st to discuss further methods for plundering private production enterprises. Bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek personally instructed the office that "agricultural loan portions" and "general industrial and mining production loans" should be carried out according to the principle of "controlling production results" in order to directly plunder and monopolize various agricultural, industrial, and mining products in the Chiang-controlled areas. This "concrete plan" is currently being drafted. The Four Families have consistently taken advantage of the precarious state of various private production enterprises to engage in arson and looting under the guise of "relief" and "loans." Before the New Year, at the end of November, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities issued "Emergency Economic Measures," suddenly announcing the cessation of all "loans," forcing various private production enterprises facing financial difficulties into desperate situations at the turn of the year. Business circles in Tianjin and other places petitioned the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities to restore loans, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ignored them. Until the end of last month, Liu Gongyun, the deputy governor of the Chiang Kai-shek "Central Bank," even declared: "Financial institutions will not temporarily open industrial loans within the Lunar New Year, but factories needing funds will be handled by purchasing finished products"; and using the excuse that "high prices affect price increases," they forcibly purchased goods at low prices.

　　四大家族残酷掠夺台糖
  　农民长年辛劳不得一饱
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】台北消息：蒋匪四大家庭垄断台省制糖业的糖业公司，残酷剥削全省农民。该公司拥有三十六个工厂，分布台省各地，霸占或统制种蔗耕地在八百七十万亩以上，占台湾全部耕地总面积一千三百余万亩的三分之二以上（按植蔗地种蔗一年后，要隔两年才能再种，此两年内一般种大米）。蒋匪已全部继承日寇对台湾人民殖民地奴隶统治之衣钵，本年植蔗总面积约近六百万亩，农民均被迫将甘蔗全部收获量缴给蒋匪台糖公司。据该司公所订掠夺式的“分糖法”规定，制糖成品，“公司得糖五成”，“农民所得之砂糖中除二十分之一拨发实物外”，其余悉由蒋匪公司方面强迫低价收购，用以供应日本及贩运国内高价出售。广大农民均蒙受剥夺，长年辛劳，不得一饱。
    又讯：蒋介石卖国政府已与麦克阿瑟之东京美军总部订立合同，以台糖二万五千吨接济日本，并允日轮自运。日轮昌丸号定十八日驶抵高雄装运。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】台湾消息：蒋美现在台拥有二十二个庞大垄断公司，侵占了台省所有轻重工矿业。其中包括糖、碱、纸、水泥、肥料、机械造船、煤、电工、钢铁机械、化学、橡胶、玻璃、纺织、油脂、窑、印刷、工程、工矿器材、炼油、铝、铜矿，各业共有三百九十二个工厂及作场。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】南京消息：四大家族金融独裁最高组织“四联总处”于二十一日举行“理事会议”，讨论进一步掠夺民间生产事业办法。匪首蒋介石亲自指示该处关于“农贷部分”及“一般工矿生产事业贷款”均应按照“掌握生产成果”原则进行，以便直接掠夺并垄断蒋区各种农、工矿业产品，此项“具体计划”正在拟定中。按四大家庭一贯乘各种民间生产事业危殆之时，以“救济”及“贷款”为名，趁火打劫。年前十一月底蒋匪当局颁布“经济紧急措施”，突然宣布停止一切“贷款”，迫使资金困难之各种民间生产事业，在新旧年关之际陷入绝境。天津等地工商业界曾向蒋匪当局请愿要求恢复贷款，蒋匪不予置理，至上月底，蒋匪“中央银行”副总裁刘攻芸竟宣称：“金融方面农历年内暂不开放工贷，但工厂需款决以收购成品方式办理”；并以“定价过高影响物价上涨”为借口，强行以低价收购。
