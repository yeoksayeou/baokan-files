Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th -- The Northwest People's Liberation Army Officer Corps here has sent back 442 captured KMT officers to their hometowns in batches from the end of last year to January this year, most of whom were KMT 76th Division officers (below the rank of colonel) who laid down their weapons in the Qingjian Campaign in northern Shaanxi. Grand farewell parties were held for each batch sent off. The KMT officers sent home expressed their gratitude for the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th -- Chen Jie, a colonel and commander of the 476th Regiment of the 159th Brigade of the KMT 64th Division (Cantonese faction), and Pan Jiping, the deputy commander of the regiment, along with 84 other officers of various ranks, who were captured in the Gaomi Campaign last year, published an open letter to the officers and soldiers of the 64th Division in the middle of last month, urging the officers and soldiers of the division, who were still forced to fight on the front lines of the anti-people civil war, to lay down their weapons quickly and stand on the side of the people. The letter vehemently criticized Chiang Kai-shek's "elimination of dissidents and annihilation of miscellaneous troops" sinister plot against the 64th Division, saying, "We have suffered more than half of our casualties in the major battles of Nanma, Linqu, and Zhucheng, and we no longer have combat power, but we are still placed on the front line. Our regiment was isolated and defended Gaomi, but when we were besieged, they turned a blind eye and sat idly by without providing assistance." The letter also said, "We sincerely advise you not to be deceived any longer, to lay down your weapons quickly, to break away from the reactionary clique, and to promote the early establishment of a democratic coalition government, so that the Chinese people can be freed from suffering as soon as possible, and you can return to your hometowns and enjoy peace as soon as possible. Otherwise, not only will your sacrifices be worthless, but you will also be sinners of the nation for all eternity."

　　晋绥分批释放解放军官数百
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】此间西北解放军官团自去年年底至今年一月已分批遣送解放军官四百四十二名回籍，其中大部为陕北清涧战役放下武器之蒋军七十六师校级以下军官。每次遣送均举行盛大欢送会。被遣送回家之蒋军军官对解放军的宽大政策都表示感谢。
    【新华社华东二十八日电】去年高密战役中解放的粤系蒋军整六十四师一五九旅四七六团上校团长陈杰、副团长潘吉屏等校尉级军官八十六人，上月中发表告六十师官兵书，规劝被迫还在反人民内战前线的该师官兵赶快放下武器，站到人民方面来。该书中痛斥蒋贼“排除异已消灭杂牌”六十四师的毒辣阴谋说：“我们经过南麻、临朐、诸城等诸大战役，官兵伤亡过半已无作战力量，但却仍被放在最前线。本团孤守高密，等到被围攻时则置若罔闻坐镇不救。”并说：“我们掬诚敬告诸位，不要再受欺骗，赶快放下武器，脱离反动集团，促使民主的联合政府早日成立，俾中国人民早脱苦海，诸位亦可早日返乡安享太平，不然，不但牺牲没有价值，且为民族万世的罪人。”
