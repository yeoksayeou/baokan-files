Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spokesperson commented on the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League (CDL) on January 5th of this year and the declaration and action program released by the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK) on New Year's Day of this year, stating: These documents demonstrate the breadth of the united front of the national democratic movement against American imperialism and the reactionary ruling clique of Chiang Kai-shek, and they indicate that the program of opposing American imperialism, overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek group, confiscating bureaucratic capital, implementing land reform, and establishing a democratic coalition government is the only path recognized by all patriots. This program has already been implemented or is being implemented in the liberated areas with a population of 160 million, and the continued victories of the People's Liberation Army will make this program a reality nationwide. All patriotic sons and daughters of the Chinese nation must use all methods to help the People's Liberation Army resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, and rescue the Republic of China from the hands of American imperialism and the traitorous and dictatorial Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The spokesperson pointed out: Chairman Mao, in his report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" on December 25th of last year, said: "Our New Democratic revolutionary united front is now broader and more consolidated than at any time in the past. This is not only related to our land policy and urban policy, but also closely related to the victory of the People's Liberation Army, the transition of Chiang Kai-shek from offensive to defensive, the transition of the People's Liberation Army from defensive to offensive, and the general political situation of the Chinese revolution entering a new high tide. Now people see that the demise of Chiang Kai-shek's rule is inevitable, and therefore place their hopes on the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, which is a very natural reason. For the victory of China's New Democratic revolution, a broad united front that includes the vast majority of the nation's population is indispensable. Moreover this united front must be under the firm leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the strong leadership of the Chinese communist party, any revolutionary united front cannot be victorious." The declarations of the Democratic League and the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang confirm Chairman Mao's words. Any attempt to establish a so-called neutral zone or neutral organization, or even a neutral regime, between revolution and counter-revolution, between democracy and anti-democracy, is impossible in China as it is in the world. If anyone engages in such activities, its essence, as the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang said, is "a second anti-democratic regime supported by American reactionaries" and can have no other role. We welcome the reorganization of the leadership organs of the Democratic League, we welcome the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and we are willing to join hands with all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic groups in the cause of the New Democratic revolution, and advance towards common goals.

　　对民盟宣言及国民党革命委员会宣言纲领
  　中共中央发言人发表评论
    【新华社陕北六日电】中共中央发言人评论今年一月五日民主同盟三中全会宣言，及国民党革命委员会今年元旦所发表的宣言与行动纲领称：这些文件，表示反对美国帝国主义与蒋介石反动统治集团的民族民主运动的统一战线，是何等广阔，表示反对美国帝国主义、打倒蒋介石集团、没收官僚资本、实行土地改革、建立民主的联合政府的纲领，乃是一切爱国者所公认的唯一道路。这一个纲领，在解放区一万万六千万人口中，已经实现或者正在实现中，人民解放军进攻的继续胜利，将使这一纲领在全国范围实现。中国民族一切爱国的儿女，必须以一切方法帮助人民解放军坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭蒋介石匪军，把中华民国从美国帝国主义与卖国独裁的蒋介石匪帮手里挽救出来。发言人指出：毛主席在去年十二月二十五日的“目前形势和我们的任务”报告中说：“我们的新民主主义的革命的统一战线，现在比过去任何时期都要广大，也比过去任何时期都要巩固。这件事，不但与我们的土地政策及城市政策相联系，而且与人民解放军的胜利，与蒋介石由进攻转入防御，人民解放军由防御转入进攻，中国革命已经进入新的高潮时期这一总的政治形势，密切地联系着。现在人们看到了蒋介石统治的灭亡已经不可避免，因而将希望寄托在中国共产党与人民解放军身上，这是很自然的道理。中国新民主主义的革命要胜利，没有一个包括全民族绝大多数人口的最广泛的统一战线，是不可能的。不但如此，这个统一战线还必须是在中国共产党的坚强的领导之下。没有中国共产党的坚强领导，任何革命统一战线也是不能胜利的”。民主同盟与国民党革命委员会的宣言，证实了毛主席的话。任何企图在革命与反革命之间、在民主与反民主之间建立所谓第三条道路的中立地带或中立组织，甚至中立政权，在中国与世界一样，都是不可能的。如果有人进行此种活动，实质上必然如国民党革命委员会所说，是“美国反动派支持下的第二个反民主政权”，绝不能有其他任何作用。我们欢迎民主同盟重建其领导机关，我们欢迎国民党革命委员会的成立，我们愿意在新民主主义的革命事业中，和所有一切反帝反封建的民主团体一道，为着共同目的而携手前进。
