Heroic Crossing of the Luo River

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) used two platoons to cross the Luo River heroically and capture Xin'an (新安) City, Yanshi (偃師). At noon on the eighth, the sixth company of a certain unit received the mission to cross the Luo River heroically from the Yangcun ferry (five li south of the city). The Luo River was deep and the current rapid, and the river surface was about 200 meters wide. The ferry boats had already been pulled to the opposite bank by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who used dense fire to block the river surface. A boatman familiar with the ferry said: "The water is seventeen or eighteen chi deep. Not to mention that they are shooting over there, even without a boat, you can't think of getting across. Four or five hundred jin anchors are sometimes washed away. Building a bridge is even more out of the question." The soldiers first put a raft made of a few small logs into the water, but it was immediately washed away by the rapid current. At this time, Wu Kaiji, the Communist Party member and combat model platoon leader of the third platoon, made a powerful appeal to the whole platoon, saying: "We must learn from the spirit of the eighteen heroes of the Red Army who crossed the Dadu River heroically, rush across the river to seize the boat, which is the whole key to completing the task." The soldiers immediately responded, unwrapping leggings and taking off cotton clothes. Wu Kaiji first jumped onto a single-person fishing boat, which had just been found in the village, carrying a submachine gun and eight grenades. Then, squad leader Zhai Xiangtian of the eighth squad and squad leader Cao Wenliang of the ninth squad also stepped onto the boat. Because the boat was small and there were many people, it was overturned by the rapid current just a few meters from the shore. The three heroes were pulled ashore by comrades holding ropes tied to them in advance. Then they each jumped into the water holding a wooden stick, but were eventually washed back by the rapid current. The three heroes were numb all over, but their determination to cross the river was as strong as steel. Together with Deputy Instructor Wu Qinping, they braved the rain of bullets and jumped into the Luo River again. Everyone on the shore stared at them nervously, and the artillery fire on both sides roared. When he was close to the shore, Comrade Wu Kaiji was unfortunately washed away by the rapid current and gloriously sacrificed himself, but Wu Qinping and other heroes continued to fight forward against the rapids. Finally, Wu Qinping successfully landed on the shore first and immediately seized the river embankment, firing at the enemy with a submachine gun. At this time, squad leader Wang Youshan of the seventh squad and soldiers Chu Jiashui, Zhang Shunzhong, and others also swam across the deep water, stood in the water and raised their submachine guns to fire at the enemy while charging forward. Heroes such as Cao Wenliang and Zhai Xiangtian also consolidated the bridgehead on the west side. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits scurried out of the river defense works and fled in panic, leaving more than a dozen frightened prisoners.

At the same time, the first platoon of the fifth company, which was crossing the river heroically at the Yangcun West Ferry, also carried out a heroic crossing under the leadership of Deputy Company Commander Geng Wanfu. A machine gun team in the platoon crossed the river heroically in the rapid current while accurately firing at the enemy, covering the entire platoon's smooth crossing and defeating the enemy guarding the river. At this point, the Luo River defense line, the southern barrier of Xin'an City, Yanshi, collapsed. The remaining bandits fled north, and the soldiers continued to pursue, directly approaching the city. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits guarding the city abandoned the city and fled north, and Xin'an City, Yanshi, was captured by the two platoons of the People's Liberation Army who crossed the river heroically.

    英勇强渡洛河
    解放军以两个排强渡洛河，并攻占了偃师新城。某部六连八日中午接受了从杨村渡口（城南五里）强渡洛河的任务。洛河水深流急，河面宽达二百米左右，渡船早已被蒋匪拉到对岸去了，蒋匪并以密集的火力封锁了河面。熟悉这渡口的一个水手说：“水深一丈七八，莫说那边还放着枪，就是平常没船也休想过去。四五百斤的铁锚有时还被冲走，搭桥更不用说了。”战士们首先用几根小木头扎成的木筏放下水去，立即被急流冲走。这时战斗模范三排排长共产党员吴开吉就向全排提出有力的号召说：“我们要学习红军十八勇士强渡大渡河的精神，冲过河去夺回船来，这是完成任务的整个关键。”战士们立即响应，纷纷解裹腿，脱棉衣。吴开吉首先带着冲锋枪和八个手榴弹跳上刚在庄内找来的一只单人打渔的小船，接着八班长翟相田，九班长曹文良也踏上了船。因为船小人多，刚离岸几米，就被急流冲翻，三勇士被岸上的同志拉着预先系在身上的绳子救了上岸。接着他们又每人抱着一根木棍跳下水去，但终于又被急流冲了回来。三勇士全身都麻木了，但渡河的决心仍象钢铁一样，他们与副指导员吴钦平又冒着弹雨，再次跃入洛河，所有岸上的人都紧张的凝视着他们，两岸的炮火响成一片。快近岸的时候，吴开吉同志不幸被急流冲没，光荣牺牲，但吴钦平和其他勇士则继续与激流奋斗前进，终于吴首先胜利登岸并立即强占河堤，用冲锋枪向敌人猛扫。这时七班长王友善、战士褚加水、张顺忠等也泅过深处立着在水里举起冲锋枪向敌人边打边冲，曹文良、翟相田等勇士并在西侧巩固了桥头堡垒。这时蒋匪纷纷钻出河防工事狼狈逃窜，剩下十多个吓呆了的作了俘虏。
    与此同时，在杨村西渡口强渡的五连一排，也在副连长耿万福率领下实行强渡。该班机枪一组在急流中一面强渡，一面向敌人准确射击，掩护全排顺利渡河，击溃了河防守敌。至此，偃师新城南面屏障的洛水河防崩溃了，残匪向北逃窜，战士们仍跟踪追击，直逼城下。守城蒋匪又弃城北逃，偃师新城遂为解放军英勇渡河的两个排攻占。（新华社）
