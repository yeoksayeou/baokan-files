Xinhua News Agency, East China, 5th. The Huaihai Sub-region in Northern Jiangsu is vigorously engaged in disaster relief. Since last July and August, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits breached the dikes of the Shu River and Liutang River, obstructed the construction of water ports, and destroyed 4 million mu of fertile land. This year, in January, they carried out a desperate "mopping-up" operation, causing severe devastation to the people of Donghai, Guanyun, Tongyang (newly established county northwest of Shuyang), and Suqian counties. According to statistics, Donghai and Guanyun counties alone had 1.65 million jin of grain, more than 2,800 head of cattle, sheep, and pigs, and countless other supplies looted. Currently, 300,000 people in the region are without food. Epidemics are prevalent. To address this, the local Party, government, and military are urgently engaged in disaster relief. The Central China Office of the Southern Anhui Border Region Government has allocated 2 million jin of grain, and the Sixth Administrative Office has also allocated 130,000 jin of grain for emergency relief to the disaster-stricken people in the aforementioned four counties who suffered from Chiang Kai-shek's "mopping-up." Additionally, 240,000 jin of grain have been allocated to the disaster-stricken people in these four counties as a production fund. Furthermore, 50,000 jin of cotton are being loaned to develop textile production, 220,000 jin of wheat seeds are being loaned to replant spring wheat, and 600,000 jin of wage grain are being allocated for work relief. Trading companies are selling 550,000 jin of grain and 80,000 jin of sweet potatoes at stable prices. At the same time, the CCP Huaihai Prefectural Committee has also issued urgent instructions, calling for combining land reform with disaster relief, rapidly distributing the fruits of struggle, organizing production for self-salvation, and promoting mutual assistance. Party, government, and military organizations in the sub-region are implementing streamlining and production savings, using the surplus grain and funds to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people. The Administrative Office has also dispatched disaster relief work teams and jointly formed an epidemic prevention committee with the military health department to work in the disaster areas.
　　The emancipated masses in friendly neighboring areas such as Yancheng and Funing in Central Jiangsu have donated more than 1.5 million jin of grain, 36 million yuan, and more than 110 taels of pure gold. The masses have also launched self-salvation through production: 1. Distributing the fruits of struggle to develop sideline occupations. Incomplete statistics from only six counties, including Guanyun and Shu counties, show that the masses have received more than 9.195 million jin of grain, 142,700 silver dollars, more than 2.62 million paper yuan, and a large number of cattle, donkeys, and clothing. Farmers in Chuanhua Village, Guanyun, jointly operate an oil press, producing three batches per day and earning 40,500 yuan, enough to support 150 people. In Shiqiao Shuzhuang Village in Donghai, 63 out of 65 households are without food; by pressing oil from fruits, they earned more than 3,400 jin of corn in 20 days, enough to sustain them for a month. 2. Farmers' associations organize disaster victims to dig lotus root (a plant with a bulbous root). Lotus roots grow extensively in fields flooded by the Huai River, with each mu yielding more than 2,000 jin. Lotus root flour can be eaten as grain, and dried lotus root can be made into sugar. One person can dig enough for two people to eat. In a certain area of Donghai, 5,000 to 6,000 people dig lotus roots every day. 3. Transporting public grain. In the past month or so, the entire sub-region has organized more than 18,400 people to transport public grain, earning a total of more than 1.035 million jin of wage grain.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 5th. The masses along the Yellow River in the Bohai Region have suffered severe disasters due to ice floes and flooding. In Lijin alone, more than 27,500 mu of farmland, more than 2,900 houses, more than 55,000 jin of grain, more than 2,700 pieces of farm equipment, and a large amount of bedding were destroyed. The democratic government has allocated a large amount of grain and funds for emergency relief, including more than 67,000 jin of grain and 17 million North Sea currency for Lijin, and approximately 50,000 jin of grain for Kenli (newly established county northeast of Lijin). In addition, 10,000 mu of land in Lijin have been allocated for disaster victims to cultivate. The Bohai Administrative Office has called on disaster victims to engage in labor mutual aid to rebuild new houses. Those who are genuinely unable to build new houses will be provided with grain and funds by the government to rebuild, and disaster victims will be assisted in reclaiming wasteland in Kenli County.
