Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—Prague dispatch: More than 100,000 Czech farmers held a rally in the central square of Prague on February 29th. TASS called it "a manifestation of the victory of Czech democracy and the unity of workers and peasants." Maslák, Chairman of the All-Slav Committee, and Gondorov, head of the Soviet delegation to the All-Slav Congress, were guests of honor at the meeting. First, the Mayor of Prague, Vasik, congratulated this unprecedented grand gathering in the history of farmers on behalf of the people of the capital. Afterwards, Gottwald took the stage amidst thunderous applause. He pointed out that the defeat of the reactionary forces showed the extraordinary unity of the Czech working people and the invincible strength of people's democracy. He said: "Workers and peasants are advancing shoulder to shoulder towards the socialist goal on the same path. Workers are for the sake of peasants, and peasants are also for the sake of workers. This is the main guarantee of our future victory." The Premier assured the assembly amidst frequent cheers from the masses that the new government and the National Front would fulfill all the demands of workers and peasants in the shortest possible time. In his speech, Minister of National Defense General Svoboda assured the peasants that the army is loyal to the people and the people's democratic regime, and is ready to defend the republic at any time. Maslák congratulated the assembly on behalf of the All-Slav Committee. He called: "Place hope in your own labor, look to the Slavs and other people's democratic countries, and look to the great brother and liberator, the Soviet Union!" Agricultural Minister Duris said in his speech: "The victory of democracy and the new Gottwald government are the best guarantees of the new land reform. We will implement land reform, and the land will belong to the tillers." The Agricultural Minister put forward a broad program for the development of agriculture, pointing out that the foundation of this program "lies in the elimination of feudal manors and assisting small and medium-sized farms with machinery, tractors, fertilizers, and loans."
