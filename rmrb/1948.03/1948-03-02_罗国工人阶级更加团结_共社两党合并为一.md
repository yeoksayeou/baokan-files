　　Romanian Working Class More United
　　Communist and Social Democratic Parties Merge
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th】 Bucharest dispatch: The Romanian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party held a joint representative conference here on the 21st (previously mistakenly reported as the 17th), and resolved to formally merge the two parties into the Workers' Party. At the meeting, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, first gave a political report. Dej believed that the establishment of a unified workers' party marked a great victory for the Romanian proletariat, and this unity was formed in an irreconcilable struggle against the right-wing social democrats, the running dogs of imperialism. Regarding the nature of the Romanian Workers' Party, Dej stated that it is a party that carries out the struggle against exploiters, a party that further develops people's democracy, and a party that carries out the anti-imperialist struggle. It is based on Lenin and Stalin's concept of establishing a new type of party. Dej asserted: Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the cooperation of democratic forces united in the People's Democratic Front, and the democratic life of Romania, will enter a higher stage.
　　On the 24th, the conference completed its work after unanimously passing the following resolution: The resolution announced the official establishment of the Romanian Workers' Party, the sole staff headquarters of the working class guided by Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism; its task is to lead the drafting of a new democratic constitution; to eliminate domestic backwardness; to strive to build an advanced industrial and agricultural country with a planned economy; and to actively support the government's policy of ensuring universal peace, security, and Romanian national independence. The resolution concluded with confidence: The Romanian Workers' Party will achieve new victories in completing the two major tasks of consolidating people's democracy and laying the foundation for the socialist system in Romania.
　　Local newspapers praised the achievements of the joint conference. *Timpul* wrote: A turning point of decisive significance in the life of the people has arrived. *Frontul Plugarilor* pointed out: Now that peasants have become masters of their own land and can enjoy the fruits of their labor, they will never forget the assistance of the working class, and therefore, they rejoice in the consolidated unity of the working class. *

　　罗国工人阶级更加团结
  　共社两党合并为一
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚共产党与社会民主党，于二十一日（前误为十七日）在此间召开两党联席代表大会，决议正式合并两党为工人党。会上首有罗共总书记乔治·德治作政治报告。德治认为统一的工人政党的建立，标志着罗国无产阶级的伟大胜利，这统一是在与帝国主义走狗右翼社会民主党进行不调和的斗争中形成的。关于罗马尼亚工人党的性质，德治标明是进行反对剥削者斗争的政党，是进一步发展人民民主主义的政党，是进行反帝斗争的政党，它是以列宁斯大林关于建立新型政党的概念为基础的。德治断言：在工人党领导下，团结在人民民主阵线中的民主力量的合作，以及罗国的民主生活，将进入更高阶段。
    二十四日，大会在一致通过如下决议后完成工作：决议宣布以马恩列斯学说为指针的工人阶级的单一参谋部--罗马尼亚工人党正式成立；其任务在于领导草拟一部民主新宪法；消灭国内的落后状态；努力建立一个有计划经济的工农业先进国；并积极支持政府保障普遍和平安全与罗国民族独立的政策。决议在结语中充满信心的说：罗马尼亚工人党，将在完成巩固人民民主和在罗国奠定社会主义制度的基础这两大任务上，取得新胜利。
    此间各报赞扬联席会议的成就。丁布尔报写道：在人民生活中有决定意义的转折点已经到来。佛朗得尔报指出：目前，当农民已成为自己土地的主人，和自己可以享受自己劳动的果实时，永远不会忘记工人阶级的援助，因此，欢欣庆幸工人阶级的巩固的团结。＊
