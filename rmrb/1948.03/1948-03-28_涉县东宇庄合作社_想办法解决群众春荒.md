　　Taihang News: The Shexian Dongyuzhuang suffered a poor harvest last year, and many poor peasants and hired laborers were running out of food before summer. The cooperative actively used the following methods to organize disaster victims for production and overcome the famine, and achieved great results. (1) Lending cotton to women to organize them to spin and weave to overcome the famine: After investigation, the cooperative manager immediately convened a women's meeting and said: "Anyone who doesn't have cotton can report the amount needed to the cooperative and borrow it. After weaving the cloth and selling it for money, you can repay it. If you wear it yourself, repay it whenever you have the money." As a result, more than fifty women borrowed a total of 375 jin, some three jin, some five jin. The women happily said, "We wanted to spin a long time ago, but we didn't have the capital. Now that we have cotton, we must spin well." (2) In organizing men to produce and overcome the famine: a lime kiln was opened, and four poor peasant and hired labor households were organized to participate in lime burning, and three poor peasant households were mobilized to gin cotton at the cooperative, earning 1,000 yuan per day. The remaining labor force was organized to go to the mountains to cut firewood, and the cooperative bought it for seven yuan per jin, so each laborer could earn at least more than 1,000 yuan per day. By the beginning of March, 70,000 jin had been cut, which, calculated at the market price of 150 yuan per jin of rice, could buy 4,600 jin of millet, solving the spring famine difficulties for some people. There were also two cripples who could not go to the mountains to cut firewood. The cooperative bought a cotton fluffer and asked them to fluff cotton, earning at least 1,200 yuan in wages per day, which also solved their difficulties. Now the production in this village is very enthusiastic, and the households that have earned millet are actively repairing land and building embankments to prepare for planting.

　　涉县东宇庄合作社
  　想办法解决群众春荒
    【太行消息】涉县东宇庄，去年收成不好，很多贫雇的粮食吃不到夏季，合作社就积极用以下办法组织灾民生产渡荒，并取得了很大成绩。（一）给妇女贷花组织妇女纺织渡荒，合作社经理经过调查后即召开妇女会说：谁家没花可以自报数目到合作社借花，等织成布卖成钱后再还，如果自己穿了啥时有钱，啥时还，结果一共有五十多个妇女你三斤我五斤，一共贷了三百七十五斤。妇女们高兴的说：“早就想纺哩，就是没本，现在有了花可要好好纺哩。”（二）在组织男人生产渡荒上是：开了一座石灰窑，组织了四个贫雇户参加烧灰，并发动了三户贫农户，到合作社轧花，每天都能赚一千元。其余劳力都组织上山割柴，合作社每斤用七元收买，这样每个劳力每天最少可赚一千多元。到三月初止，已割了七万斤，按市价一斤米一百五十元计，可买小米四千六百斤，解决了一部分人的春荒困难。还有两个拐子不能上山割柴，合作社买了个弹花弓，叫他们弹花，每天最少亦可赚一千二百元工资，也把他们的困难解决了。现在这村生产搞的很热烈，赚下米的户都是积极在修地垒堰，准备下种。
