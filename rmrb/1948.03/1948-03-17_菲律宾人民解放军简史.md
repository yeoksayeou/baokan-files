Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. The predecessor of the Philippine People's Liberation Army was the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," established in March 1942, organized by leaders of the Philippine Communist Party, labor unions, farmers' associations, socialists, and other democratic parties. Later, it developed to have 30,000 regular troops and 50,000 reserves. During the three years of resistance against Japan, it fought the enemy and puppet troops 1,200 times, killing or wounding approximately 25,000 enemies. The People's Anti-Japanese Army was scattered throughout the Philippine Islands, with particularly intense activity in the provinces of Bataan, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija in central Luzon. Wherever the People's Anti-Japanese Army went, it confiscated land from big landlords and pro-Japanese collaborators, distributed it to the peasants, and established democratic regimes. During the Anti-Japanese War, it contained a large number of Japanese troops. When the U.S. military landed on Leyte Island in the Philippines in October 1944, the People's Anti-Japanese Army contained the Japanese troops on various islands, preventing them from transferring troops. When the Japanese situation in the Battle of Leyte entered a crisis stage, it turned to counter-offensive, cooperating with the U.S. military to capture the only stronghold of the Japanese on the west coast, Ormoc City, and other important locations. The People's Anti-Japanese Army cooperated with the U.S. military to defeat the Japanese troops in the Philippines, and its contribution is indelible.
    However, after the U.S. imperialists reoccupied the Philippines, they issued a reactionary order to disarm the People's Anti-Japanese Army. In addition to using force to disarm some units of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, they also arrested three important leaders (including the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, Aliantino, etc.) and supported pro-Japanese Filipino traitor forces to suppress the Philippine people's democratic movement. At that time, 25,000 people gathered in San Fernando near Manila to protest this measure by the U.S. imperialists. For the past two years, the People's Anti-Japanese Army, led by Taruc, has firmly defended its base areas in central Luzon and other places, and is engaged in a resolute struggle against the U.S.-Roxas bandits. Its strength is growing daily. The People's Anti-Japanese Army now controls one-tenth of the Philippines.

　　菲律宾人民解放军简史
    【新华社陕北十四日电】菲律宾人民解放军之前身为“人民抗日军”，建立于一九四二年三月，由菲共、工会、农会领袖社会主义者及其他民主党派组织起来的。后来发展到拥有三万名正规军和五万名后备队。在三年抗日期间，它与敌伪作战一千二百次，毙伤敌人约二万五千名。人民抗日军散布在菲律宾各岛屿，在吕宋岛中部的巴邦加、巴拉干、爱西加诸省之活动，尤其激烈。人民抗日军所到之处，没收了大地主及通敌分子的土地，分配给农民，并建立起民主政权。抗日期间，它牵制了日寇大量兵力，当一九四四年十月美军在菲律宾莱特岛登陆，人民抗日军曾牵制了各岛日军，使之无法抽调兵员。当日寇在莱特战局进入危机阶段时，它即转入反攻，配合美军攻下日寇在西海岸之唯一据点欧尔摩克城及其他要地。人民抗日军配合美军击败菲律宾日寇，具有不可磨灭的功劳。
    但美帝重占菲岛之后，即颁布解除人民抗日军武装的反动命令，除用武力将人民抗日军若干队伍缴械外，并逮捕了三名重要领袖（包括人民抗日军副总指挥阿里安蒂诺等），并扶植亲日菲奸势力镇压菲人民民主运动。当时马尼拉附近之山芬兰诺有二万五千名群众集会，抗议美帝此种措施。两年来，以塔拉克为首的人民抗日军坚守吕宋中部等根据地，与美罗匪徒进行坚决的斗争中，势力日强，现人民抗日军已控制菲律宾十分之一地区。
