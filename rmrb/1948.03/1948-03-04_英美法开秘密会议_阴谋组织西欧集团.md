Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st - Comprehensive reports: The Anglo-American-French tripartite conference, a “conspiracy to unilaterally cancel the Foreign Ministers' Conference” (TASS), was extended to February 23 and convened arbitrarily in London. The conference is expected to last about two weeks and is still being conducted in secret. According to various sources, the main objectives of the meeting are to separate the Ruhr from the rest of Germany, establish a joint Anglo-American-French occupation zone, and conspire to organize a Western European bloc. American imperialism and its British and French lackeys have decided to invite the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to participate in the meeting when discussing "relevant issues" to help them cheer and wave flags. Democratic newspapers in Berlin have fiercely criticized this meeting. The Daily Review believes that "the meeting is a further deepening of the division of Germany and turning West Germany into a base for the expansionist policy of American imperialism." The newspaper pointed out that the economic merger of the Saar with France (according to Agence France-Presse on the 20th, the agreement has been signed) is the price France agreed to for the merger of the three occupation zones. The newspaper strongly stated that any resolution of the London conference cannot be considered valid. The German News loudly called out: The German people will never recognize any decision aimed at dismembering Germany. Furthermore, the joint resolution of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of South, Czech, and Poland has been submitted to the US State Department. The resolution strongly opposes the unilateral meeting of the US, Britain, and France, and firmly asserts that South, Czech, and Poland have the right to send representatives to attend any discussion on the future German issue. The Soviet Ambassador to the United States also sent a note to the United States on February 27, supporting the demands of the three countries.

　　英美法开秘密会议
  　阴谋组织西欧集团
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：“阴谋片面取消外长会议”（塔斯社）的美英法三国会议，已延至二月二十三日擅自在伦敦召开。会期约二周、迄今仍秘密进行中。据各方透露：会议主要目的在将鲁尔与德国其余部分分离，建立英美法联合占区及阴谋组织西欧集团等。美帝及其英法走卒已决定邀请荷、比、卢在讨论“有关问题”时参加会议，以助其摇旗呐喊。柏林各民主报纸对这一会议猛烈予以抨击。每日评论报认为“会议是进一步加深德国的分裂，并把西德变成美帝扩张政策的基地”。该报指出：萨尔在经济上合并于法（据法新社二十日电称：该协定业已签订），是法国同意三占区合并的代价。该报力称：伦敦会议之任何决议都不能认为有效。德意志新闻大声力呼：德国人民决不承认以肢解德国为目的之一切决定。又讯：南、捷、波三国外长会议的联合决议，已递交美国务院，决议竭力反对美英法片面的会议，并坚称：对将来德国问题之任何讨论，南、捷、波有派遣代表出席之权利。苏驻美大使于二月二十七日亦照会美国，支持该三国之要求。
