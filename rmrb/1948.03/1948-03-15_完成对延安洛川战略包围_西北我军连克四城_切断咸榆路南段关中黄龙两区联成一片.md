Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army continues to expand its powerful offensive, successively capturing the three cities of中部 (Zhongbu), 宜君 (Yijun), and 白水 (Baishui) in six hours from the night of the 9th to the morning of the 10th. More than 100 soldiers from the First Battalion of the 15th Regiment of the newly formed Shaanxi Security Force, the defending enemy of 中部 (Zhongbu), gloriously revolted. The remaining enemies fled south in panic, and our army is pursuing them vigorously. Our army has now cut off the southern section of the Xianyang-Yulin Highway (from Xianyang to Yan'an), a highway lifeline for the Hu bandits in northern Shaanxi, and completed the strategic encirclement of the two cities of Yan'an and Luochuan, putting the more than 20,000 Hu bandits defending those two cities in an utterly hopeless situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: Under the shock of the victorious offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, the defending enemy of the ＠ county seat, eighty kilometers south of Yan'an, a puppet security regiment, abandoned the city and fled for their lives on the 10th. Our army immediately recovered the county seat, pursuing and annihilating two companies of fleeing enemies, capturing more than 150 Hu bandits and local reactionary armed forces, seizing more than 310 various machine guns, rifles, and short guns, more than 1,100 *shi* of grain, and completely eliminating the reactionary armed forces of five rural offices belonging to the puppet Huanglong and Luochuan counties. In our army's fan-shaped offensive against the Hu bandits' southern section of the Xianyang-Yulin Highway, we have now captured the three county seats of 中部 (Zhongbu), 宜君 (Yijun), and 白水 (Baishui), as well as the important towns of 龙坊 (Longfang) town northwest of 中部 (Zhongbu) county, 交道 (Jiaodao) town southeast of ＠ county, and 交河口 (Jiaohekou) between Luochuan and 中部 (Zhongbu). At this moment, the Guanzhong and Huanglong sub-districts have been connected into one area.

Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 13th: On the 3rd, the local armed forces of Sanhe County, Eastern Hebei, ambushed two platoons of the Chiang bandit police standing team that came out of Sanhe to harass the area, in the Hougezhuang area of the county, killing or wounding 19 including the platoon leader, and capturing 72 alive. They seized six light machine guns, 61 rifles and short guns, three grenade launchers, and some other materials.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: According to preliminary statistics on the war results of Huaihai local armed forces recovering Shuyang City, they seized 30 various cannons, three light and heavy machine guns, 1,010 rifles, 3,740 artillery shells, and many other military supplies. Under the attack of our local armed forces, the Chiang bandits in Shuyang City hurriedly abandoned their weapons and fled in panic on the night of the 5th. After the recovery of Shuyang City, we immediately launched a search and suppression operation within a radius of dozens of *li* around the city. All the weapons discarded by the Chiang bandits along the way were also seized, and more than 90 Chiang bandits who had not had time to escape were captured. (Attached picture)
