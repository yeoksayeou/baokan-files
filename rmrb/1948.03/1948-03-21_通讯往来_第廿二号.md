    Correspondence No. 22
    To the Editor:
    My grievance, which was published in your newspaper issue No. 611, has been out for a long time, but I have not seen any expression of attitude from them. I am very frustrated. Please publish it again and urge the following three people to thoroughly reflect and express their attitude: 1. Cao, Adjudicator of the Judicial Department of the Jinnan Administrative Office; 2. Niu Xiangfu, Head of the Judicial Section of the Xin County of Jinnan; 3. Fan Shangchen, Judicial Assistant of the × District of Xin County. They are all staff members of our democratic government and are all working for the masses. May I ask, for whom are these three people working? What is their position? What were they thinking at the time? Please reply! I eagerly await your response!
  　　　　Wang Rujiang, Yuanzhao County Post Office, March 6th
    To Comrades Niu Xiangfu and others in Jinnan:
    Wang Rujiang's problem has already been published in this newspaper, but no reply has been received so far. Now Wang Rujiang has sent two more letters urging for a response. We hope you will reply as soon as possible.

专栏：

    通讯往来　第廿二号编辑同志：
    关于我的冤屈状，已在贵报第六一一期上登出，至今已很久，但未见他们表示态度，甚闷，请贵报再登一下，追追以下三人，叫他们彻底反省表示态度：一、冀南行署司法处曹审判员，二、冀南莘县司法科长牛相甫，三、莘县×区司法助理范商臣。他们都是咱民主政府的工作人员，都是为群众办事的，请问问他们三人究竟替谁办的事？是何立场？他们当时是何种想法？请答复是为至盼！
  　　　　元朝县邮政局王汝江　三月六日冀南牛相甫等三同志：
    王汝江的问题，早已在本报刊出，至今未见答复，现王汝江又两次来函催问，希你们早作答复。
