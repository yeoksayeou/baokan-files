Working Communication:

    We welcome comrades from all over the border region who are participating in land reform work to exchange work situations, exchange work opinions, study work problems, and collectively solve them by concentrating opinions from various aspects with maximum space. Whether it is systematic or fragmentary, whether it is material or experience; whether it is in the form of writing articles, writing letters, or writing communications diaries, any form is acceptable, just write down what you want to say; don't write party jargon. Other comrades can also write letters to discuss different opinions. Each place has its own specific circumstances, and the communications published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used as a reference for everyone.
    How to Approach the Masses?
    Ping Bo
    After we studied the work in Jidian Village of Guangzong Saltworks in Yinan, and listened to the reports from six villages including Daxinzhuang, Changxiang, and Xujiazhuang, we have the following experiences based on the work situation in these six villages in the past five days, and would like to put them forward for your research and reference:
    (1) How to Start
    There are two methods at the beginning of the Jidian Village work.
    The first method: Cadres go to the village for static investigation and isolated visits to poor peasants and hired laborers. For example, after our cadres arrived at the saltworks village, they did not hold any meetings, nor did they publicly publicize the policies, nor did they clearly express our attitude, and went separately to investigate and visit poor peasants and hired laborers. As a result, the masses only said that they were poor and suffered, and when they were asked about the affairs of the village, they shook their heads and said they didn't know. Similarly, Changxiang also secretly went to talk to poor peasants and hired laborers. As a result, after finding one to talk to once, they dared not meet again. The village-level cadres also panicked when they saw our actions and tried to resist, sending people to monitor us. Other villages also adopted this method, and the progress was very slow, with great effort but little effect. We think this method is not good, because the masses do not understand our attitude, and think that we are still like in the past, so their concerns cannot be broken, they dare not tell the truth, and dare not approach us. The village cadres and party members are also confused, thinking that we are preparing to fight them, and they are terrified and uneasy, creating a situation of opposition with us. Facts have proved that this method is a failure.
    The second method: Cadres publicly publicize the policies and clearly express their attitude as soon as they arrive in the village, and then conduct visits to poor peasants and hired laborers, and promote them to carry out liaison. For example, Xujiazhuang and Anwantou adopted this method. After we simply understand the situation when we arrive in the village, we will hold a mass meeting to explain the policies clearly, explain the attitude and policies towards all strata, especially our attitude, and then hold a branch party member meeting to conduct education, educate them to bow their heads to the masses, and changing mistakes is the bright road. In this way, the masses dare to approach us and tell the truth, and the village cadres and party members also feel that as long as they correct their mistakes and obey the masses, they still have a way out, reducing resistance. Facts have proved that this method is more successful.
    (2) Approaching the Masses Should Be Combined with the Daily Life of the Masses
    When we talk to poor peasants and hired laborers to approach them, we must combine it with the daily life of the masses, so as not to hinder production, and make them not say "can't afford to delay the work." For example, the saltworks work group went to the place where the masses were digging tree roots, and talked while helping with the work; the female comrades went to the place where women collectively spin flowers to talk. Some members of the Daxinzhuang work group helped the masses with manure pits and pulling manure. There are many people weaving baskets there, and the cadres went to the place where they collectively weave baskets to talk. In addition, we should choose the time when the masses are not busy to talk, such as after lunch, in the evening and other times. In short, it should be closely combined with the daily life and production of the masses. In the process of approaching the masses for talks, we should first talk about family matters and their past pain and the situation of turning over, and then talk about the situation in the village, instead of asking about the situation in the village directly.
    (3) The Masses Act on Their Own, The Masses Liaise on Their Own
    If you want to mobilize and organize the masses well, the masses must carry out their own liaison and act on their own. This time, due to improper methods at the beginning in villages such as Changxiang and Saltworks, it has formed that only our cadres talk to poor peasants and hired laborers, and the poor peasants and hired laborers do not act. We find a few and count them as a few, and these few are not active. On the contrary, in Xujiazhuang, after we visited five poor peasants and hired laborers, we talked through our thoughts very well, and they actively acted on their own, and quickly connected 41 poor peasant households, and Li Mo also similarly connected nearly 50 poor peasant households. In this way, on the one hand, they are familiar with the situation, and the people who are connected are easy to be correct, and on the other hand, from the mass' own liaison activities, active elements emerge and mass leaders are cultivated.

### 怎样接近群众？

专栏：工作通讯

    我们以最大的篇幅，欢迎边区各地参加土地改革工作的同志们交流工作情况，交换工作意见，研究工作问题，集中多方面意见然后加以共同解决。系统的也好，片断的也好，材料也好，心得也好；用写文章的形式也好，写信的形式也好，写通讯记日记的形式也好，不拘什么形式都好，把要说的话写出来就可以；千万不要党八股客里空。别的同志有不同的意见，也可以写信来讨论。一个地方有一个地方的具体情况，这里发表的通讯不一定对每个地方都适用，但可供大家参考。
    怎样接近群众？
    萍波
    我们研究了翼南广宗盐场基点村工作之后，又听取了大辛庄、常相、徐家庄等六个村的汇报，根据这六个村庄五天来的工作情况，有如下几点经验，愿提出来，供大家研究和参考：
    （一）如何着手
    基点村工作一开始时有两种方法。
    第一种方法：干部到村静止的调查，孤立的访问贫雇。如盐场我们干部到村后，什么会也没开，也不公开的宣传政策，也不明确的表明我们的态度，就分头调查访问贫雇，结果群众只说我穷我苦，一提到村里的事他们便摇头不知。又如常相也是同样偷偷摸摸的去找贫雇谈话，结果找到一个谈了一回，人家再不敢给见面了。村级干部见我们此种行动，也恐慌起来，设法抵抗，派人监视。其他村庄也有是采用这一种办法的，进度都非常之慢，用力甚大收效甚小。我们觉得这种办法不好，因为群众不了解我们的态度，以为我们还象过去那样，所以顾虑打不破，真心话不敢说，不敢接近我们。村干党员也摸不着头脑，以为我们在准备斗争他们，恐怖不安，造成与我们对立的局面。事实证明，这种办法是失败的。
    第二种方法：干部到村一开始就公开宣传政策，明确的表明态度，然后进行访问贫雇，并推动他们进行串连。如徐家庄和安湾头都是采用这种办法。我们到村只简单了解一下情况后，就召开群众会讲清政策，讲明对各阶层的态度和政策，特别是讲明我们的态度，然后开支部党员会进行教育，教育他们向群众低头，改过认错就是明路。这样一来，群众就敢于接近我们说出真心话，村干党员也觉得只要有错改错服从群众就仍有出路而减少了抵抗。事实证明这办法比较成功。
    （二）接近群众要与群众的日常生活相结合
    我们找贫雇谈话接近他们，一定要与群众之日常生活结合起来，如此才不会妨害生产，才使他们不说“耽误不起工夫”。如盐场工作组到群众刨树根的地方，一面帮助干活，一面谈话；女同志到妇女集体纺花的地方去谈话。大辛庄工作组有的帮助群众出粪坑拉粪，那里编簸箕的很多，干部即到他们集体编簸箕的地方去谈话。此外，要选择群众不忙的时间去谈话，如午饭后，晚上等时间。总之应与群众的日常生活、生产密切结合起来。在接近群众谈话当中，应当先从家常谈到他过去的苦痛，翻身的情形，进而谈到村中的情况，不要开门见山一问就是村中情况。
    （三）群众自己行动，群众自己串连
    要想把群众很好的发动组织起来，必须是群众自己串连，自己行动。这次常相、盐场等村由于一开始的搞法不妥，所以形成了只我们干部找贫雇谈话，贫雇并不活动，我们找几个算几个，而这几个也不积极。相反的，在徐家庄我们访问了五个贫雇之后，即很好的谈通了思想，他们自己积极活动起来，很快串连了四十一户贫农，李磨也同样的串连了将近五十户贫农。如此，一方面他们对情况熟习，串连的人容易正确，另方面从群众自己的串连活动当中来涌现积极分子，培养群众领袖。
