Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st. The Northeast Political Committee's Education Committee recently convened a conference of the heads of the education departments of the seven provinces in East, West, and North Manchuria, the directors of education bureaus of special municipalities, and the principals of major secondary schools in various provinces, to review the secondary education work in various localities since the first education conference in August of last year. The conference mainly addressed three issues: (1) winning over and reforming old intellectuals, particularly the attitude towards children of landlords and rich peasants; (2) cultivating new intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds; and (3) how to further develop secondary education in the future. Everyone agreed that in the past six months, most secondary schools had initially changed the blind orthodox views among students and established the revolutionary idea of serving the people. However, some deviations also emerged, such as certain secondary school leaders mechanically transplanting the methods or organizational forms of the land reform movement into schools, simply purging children of landlords and rich peasants based on their class background, dismissing teachers, and even shutting down schools and establishing worker-peasant-poor-peasant children's committees, etc. These are inconsistent with the actual situation today and represent a petty-bourgeois appeasement mentality lacking policy thinking. On the other hand, some responsible comrades in individual schools have lost their position and spoke in favor of the families of landlords' children who were being struggled against. The conference believed that intellectuals must be won over and reformed to become a force in the New Democratic Revolution. The children of landlords and rich peasants should also be won over and reformed. As for how to improve further on the current basis, everyone believed that after the initial ideological transformation of students, cultural education should be strengthened, but ideological education should be integrated throughout the entire curriculum. Finally, Comrade Kai Feng, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC, made a concluding speech. He first pointed out that the deviations in secondary education work in various localities reflected the subjective nature of leadership and the lack of analysis of specific situations. Comrade Kai Feng then explained the class line in schools, saying: "Schools should have a class viewpoint and a class line, but this should mainly be ideological leadership, the ideological leadership of New Democracy. Having the ideological leadership of New Democracy means having a class line. Not having the ideological leadership of New Democracy means not having a class line. At the same time, the mass line in schools should also be based mainly on students who are ideologically progressive, and not simply based on the good or bad family background of the students." Regarding the view of intellectuals, Comrade Kai Feng believed that without reforming the old intellectuals, it would be impossible to cultivate a large number of worker-peasant intellectuals. Today, winning over and reforming these existing intellectuals to serve the workers and peasants is precisely a preparatory condition for enrolling a large number of worker-peasant children in the future. The Northeast Bureau's recent "Decision on Intellectuals" has explained the importance of intellectuals in the Chinese revolution and the possibility of winning over and reforming them. Therefore, today our educational work should mainly continue to win over and reform the old intellectuals, and at the same time, pay attention to and begin to cultivate new worker-peasant intellectuals. Comrade Kai Feng finally pointed out the necessity of combining theory and practice in education work, believing that students must participate in practical work and various social activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st. The Northeast Administrative Committee promulgated the "Instructions on Secondary Education" on the 13th of this month, with the following main points: (1) This committee fully agrees with the Northeast Central Bureau of the CPC's decision on intellectuals, adopting the policy and methods of winning over, educating, and reforming the old intellectuals. In the past two years, secondary schools have won over more than 10,000 students to participate in the revolution. In the future, we should continue to enroll a large number of students and win over and reform them on a large scale to meet the needs of the current Chinese people's liberation struggle and the New Democratic construction cause. Today, in the tide of land reform, students from landlord and rich peasant families are inevitably experiencing some emotional fluctuations and dissatisfaction under the influence of feudal families, but these ideological emotions can be changed. Today's objective situation has clearly pointed out to them: Only by following Mao Zedong and the Communist Party, and following the masses of the people, can there be a bright future. Under the revelation of this truth, the majority of educated youths can be won over to participate in the revolution. Therefore, regardless of the background of educated youths, even those from landlord and rich peasant families, as long as they are willing to break away from their old class and firmly stand on the side of the people and serve the people, they are welcome. (2) In the past, under national oppression and feudal oppression, the children of workers, peasants, and laborers did not have the opportunity to go to school, and even fewer were able to enter secondary school. This is the misfortune that imperialism and the great landlords and capitalists of China gave to the Chinese people. Today, the laboring people have turned over and enjoy the right to education, and we should begin to change this unfortunate phenomenon. Secondary schools and normal schools in various localities should find ways to provide poor children with the convenience of entering school as much as possible according to local conditions, such as setting up public expenses, work-study programs, and local subsidies, to cultivate new types of intellectuals. Enrolling liberated poor students and reforming old educated youths can play a great role. When enrolling liberated poor children, the requirements for cultural level should not be too high. Whether they should be cultivated into what kind of talents, whether they should be placed in separate classes in secondary schools, or whether they should set up separate schools, and the duration of study, etc., should be determined according to the possible conditions and needs of each locality. (3) School education should implement the ideological leadership of New Democracy, transform old ideas, and teach them the spirit of "serving the people" and "integrating with the people" to engage in the people's liberation war and the New Democratic construction cause. (4) In the future, education must be carried out according to the ideological situation of the students. Ideological transformation should still be carried out for students who have not been ideologically transformed or have not yet been transformed well, adopting educational methods such as explaining the facts, clarifying the reasons, distinguishing right from wrong, clarifying black and white, and inspiring self-awareness. In elementary schools, more attention should be paid to using methods of inspiration and guidance, and opposing the subjective and rigid transplantation of secondary education or even cadre training methods. For students who have undergone ideological transformation and have initially changed their blind orthodox views, in addition to continuing to improve their political understanding, attention should be paid to improving their cultural level. In terms of quantity, cultural courses should be more important than political courses, but efforts should be made to integrate ideological education throughout the entire curriculum. In the future, these students should mainly be taught six subjects: political common sense, Chinese, mathematics, history, geography, and nature. Our school education must overcome the old problem of being detached from reality and should be combined with reality. What is urgently needed should be learned. Therefore, students should have the opportunity to go to the countryside and participate in social activities, go to practice in reality, and experience it, guiding them to go to reality and face the masses.

### 东北举行中学教育会议　明确今后施教方针

　　东北举行中学教育会议
  　明确今后施教方针
    【新华社东北一日电】东北政委会教育委员会最近召集东、西、北满七省教育厅长，特别市教育局局长，及各省主要中学校长会议，检讨自去年八月第一次教育会议以来各地中学教育工作，会上主要解决三个问题：（一）争取与改造旧知识分子，特别是对地主富农子弟的态度问题。（二）培养工农子弟新知识分子问题。（三）今后如何进一步进行中学教育问题。大家认为半年来大部中学都初步改变了学生中的盲目正统观念，建立为人民服务的革命思想。但亦产生了若干偏差，如某些中学领导人机械的把土改运动中的方式或组织形式，搬运到学校里，单纯根据成份出身洗刷地主富农子弟，辞退教员，甚至停办学校，成立工农贫民子弟委员会等，这都是不符合今天实际情况的，是一种小资产阶级的迎合性，没有政策的思想。另一方面，也有个别学校的负责同志，则丧失立场，为被斗争地主子弟的家庭说情等行为。大会认为知识分子必须争取改造，使他们成为新民主主义革命中的一份力量。对地主富农子弟，同样应予以争取改造。至于如何在现在基础上提高一步，大家认为学生思想初步改造之后，应加强文化教育，但应把思想教育贯串到整个课程中。最后由中共东北局宣传部长凯丰同志作总结性的讲话，他首先指出：各地中学教育工作的偏差，反映了领导上主观主义，对具体情况缺乏分析。凯丰同志继解释学校中的阶级路线说：“学校中是应该有阶级观点、阶级路线的，但这主要的应该是思想领导，是新民主主义的思想领导。有新民主主义的思想领导，就是有阶级路线。没有新民主主义的思想领导，就是没有阶级路线。同时学校中的群众路线，也只能是争取思想上进步的学生为主，而不应单纯的根据学生家庭成份的好坏为主。”对于知识分子的看法，凯丰同志认为离开改造旧知识分子，就不可能培养大批工农知识分子。今天争取、改造这些旧有知识分子，使他们为工农服务，正是为了明天大量招收工农子弟入学的准备条件，东北局最近所发“关于知识分子的决定”中已说明重视知识分子在中国革命中的作用以及争取改造他们的可能性。所以今天我们的教育工作，主要的仍应继续争取改造旧有知识分子，同时应注意与着手培养新的工农子弟知识分子。凯丰同志最后指出：教育工作中理论和实际结合的必要，认为学生须参加实际工作，实际参加各种社会活动。
    【新华社东北一日电】东北行政委员会于本月十三日颁布“关于中等教育的指示”要点如下：（一）本会完全同意中共东北中央局关于知识分子的决定，对旧有知识分子采取争取、教育、改造的方针和办法，两年来中等学校已争取了一万多学生参加革命，今后仍应大量招生，大批争取与改造，以适应当前中国人民解放斗争和新民主主义建设事业的需要。今天土地改革的浪潮中，出身为地主富农子弟的学生，在封建家庭的影响下，不免有些情绪波动，心怀不满，但他们这种思想情绪，是可以改变的。今天的客观形势已向他们明白指出：只有跟毛泽东和共产党走，跟人民大众走，才有光明的前途，在这个真理的昭示下，多数知识青年是可以争取来参加革命的，因此不管是什么成份的知识青年，即使是出身地主富农家庭的知识青年，只要他们愿意脱离自己的旧阶级，坚决站到人民方面来，为人民服务，都欢迎他们。（二）过去在民族压迫和封建压迫之下，工农劳苦群众子弟没有机会上学读书，能升中学的更是少数，这是帝国主义和中国大地主大资产阶级所给予中国人民的不幸，今天劳动人民翻身了，享有受教育的权利，应着手改变这种不幸的现象。各地中学师范应根据当地的条件，多方面想办法，如设公费、半工半读、地方补助等等尽量给贫苦子弟以入学的方便，培养为新型的知识分子。招收翻身贫苦学生并对改造旧知识青年，能起很大作用，在招收翻身贫苦子弟时对文化水平不能要求过高，把他们培养成什么人材，是在中学校单独编班，还是另设学校以及肄业期限等，应根据各地的可能条件与需要来决定。（三）学校教育要贯彻新民主主义的思想领导，改造旧思想，教他们以“为人民服务”“和人民打成一片”的精神，从事于人民解放战争和新民主主义的建设事业。（四）今后须根据学生的思想情况，进行教育，对于未经思想改造和尚未改造好的学生，仍要进行思想改造，采取说明事实，讲清道理，辨别是非，弄清黑白，启发自觉等教育方法。在小学校，更应注意使用启发诱导的方法，反对主观、生硬搬运中学教育、甚至干部训练的办法。对于经过思想改造，初步改变了盲目正统观念的学生，除继续提高政治认识外，应注意提高文化水平，从分量说文化课应重于政治课，但应善于把思想教育贯串到整个课程中。今后对这些学生主要应教学政治常识、国文、数学、历史、地理、自然六门功课。我们的学校教育，必须克服脱离实际的老毛病，应与实际相结合，迫切需要什么就学什么。因此，要有机会让学生下乡，和参加社会活动，到实际中去实习，去体验，引导他们走向实际，面向群众。
