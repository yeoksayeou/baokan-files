Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th: The Minsheng Paper Mill in Mizhi County, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, operated by Mr. Ai Bingqing through shareholding, has developed rapidly with the active support of the democratic government. In 1939, during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit He Shaonan, the factory's capital was equivalent to just over 1,000 silver dollars, with two technicians and four workers, and both output and quality were low. After the establishment of the democratic regime in 1940, with the active support of the government, by 1944, the number of shareholders had expanded to more than 300 households, and the capital had increased to more than 33,000 silver dollars. Currently, it has 19 vats, 8 grinding mills, 22 mules, and 43 workers. It has also improved its equipment, enabling production even on rainy days in winter, with a daily output of six reams of folio newspaper. Last August, the factory suffered from a disaster caused by Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's bandits, with losses of over 7,000 silver dollars and much of the factory equipment destroyed. Thanks to the efforts of all employees over the past six months, it has now been fully restored. Mr. Ai believes that these achievements are the result of the implementation of labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit, and the workers' active care for the factory. Mr. Ai also told reporters: "Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, I ran around outside for more than ten years without any success. After the war, I returned to northern Shaanxi and, influenced by the progressive ideas of the Communist Party, gradually realized that feudal exploitation must be eliminated, while private industry and commerce can be developed. Therefore, I abandoned land exploitation and turned to industry. After 1940, I received a lot of help from the democratic government, which strengthened my belief even more. In the future, I will do my best to expand the business."

　　在民主政府积极扶助下
  　米脂民生纸厂发展
    【新华社西北二十八日电】陕甘宁边区米脂县艾炳卿先生集股经营之民生纸厂，在民主政府积极扶助下迅速发展。该厂在一九三九年蒋匪何绍南统治时代，资金折合白洋仅有千余元，技师二人，工人四名，产量质量都不高。四○年民主政权建立后，在政府积极扶助下，至一九四四年，股东即扩大为三百余户，股金增至白洋三万三千余元。目前则已有池子十九个、碾子八个、骡子二十二头，工人四十三名，并改善设备，冬季雨天亦能进行生产，可日出对开报纸六令。去年八月该厂曾遭到蒋胡匪灾，损失资财达白洋七千余元，工厂设备多被毁坏。半年来由于全体职工努力现已完全恢复。艾氏认为这些成绩乃是实行了劳资合作与劳资两利，工人们积极爱护工厂的结果。艾氏并向记者称：“抗战前我在外面奔跑了十几年，毫无成就，抗战后回到陕北，受了共产党进步思想的影响、逐渐认识到封建剥削必须消灭，私人工商业则可得到发展，因此我便放弃土地剥削而转入了工业。四○年后得到民主政府的多方帮助，更加强了我的信念。今后将尽力扩大营业。”
