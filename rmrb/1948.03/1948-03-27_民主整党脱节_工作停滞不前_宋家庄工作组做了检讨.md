　　Democratic Rectification of the Party Disconnected
  　Work Stagnant
  　Songjiazhuang Work Group Conducts Self-Criticism
    [Pingtong News] Songjiazhuang Village in the Fifth District is a village of more than 370 households. Historically, the masses were dissatisfied with the cadres. The relationship between cadres and the masses was resolved once in 1944-45. At that time, the branch committee secretary, Ma Xiaoshan, led the masses to give opinions to the cadres, but after the opinions were given, he said it was against the cadres and that there were problems. Thus, he led the cadres to oppose the masses again, tying up two people who gave more opinions, saying they were spies. In 1946, there was an anti-spy campaign, and the cadres retaliated against the masses, saying that poor peasant Zhang Zhuzhen and others were spies. Zhang was forced to commit suicide, and some were detained and beaten. Since then, the village cadres have boldly ridden roughshod over the people. The struggle against landlord Sanhetang in the village yielded a lot of fruit, most of which was embezzled by the cadres. Wang Baotian, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, originally had only three and a half mu of land. After the emancipation, he seized 28 mu of good land for himself. He planted ten mu of wheat, while some poor peasants and farm laborers had no land to plant at all. One poor peasant family was allocated three mu of good land and had already planned to apply fertilizer to plant wheat, but he took it back and planted it himself. The masses reflected: "In our village, the cadres plant good land, and the masses plant sandy slopes." A loan of 1.3 million yuan was taken out, and the cadres, in the name of organizing small cooperatives, did not distribute it to the masses. Sun Zhicheng, the political director, borrowed 100,000 yuan for himself. The masses were dissatisfied with these things but dared not speak up. In addition, the leadership committed bureaucracy in the past, and instead of inspecting and criticizing, they praised this group of people. On the 13th of last month, the work group arrived in the village and first convened a branch meeting and a mass meeting, speaking about the "Letter to Farmers" and the "Letter to Party Members," and stating the attitude of the work group. After the meeting, they conducted door-to-door visits, completely ignoring the old organization. This caused the bad cadres to make trouble, intimidating the masses. Some lay down, and some party members and cadres with no major problems resisted emotionally. Sun Zhicheng, the political director, ate and drank lavishly, eating dumplings at night. His brother, Sun Zhigang, even sold his mule. Village chief Zhang Fuzhen said: "This time is the 28th year, returning to heaven; loyal and good people have no good end." The cooperative director sarcastically said: "I saw the Poor Peasants' League meeting and laughed so hard I cried." They carried out such activities of sabotage, but were not promptly exposed and struck down in front of the masses. Seeing the cadres' attitude, the masses dared not stand up. On the other hand, our purpose in mobilizing the masses was not clear. We only aimed to establish the Poor Peasants' League and collect materials, without paying attention to dispelling the masses' concerns and production demands. Thus, although we organized the Poor Peasants' Group, no one spoke at the Poor Peasants' League meeting. A woman named Bai Yufeng reported some materials to us. Her mother spat in her face, and her husband beat her.

    Based on this situation, the work group changed its original policy and decided that two people would focus on the rectification of the Party, while the others would continue to conduct individual visits. However, the rectification of the branch was not communicated internally or externally, and the masses could not figure out what was going on. The masses still could not be mobilized, and several bad cadres did not reflect on their actions, lying down and saying: "Let the higher authorities handle it." Thus, we realized that we had not mobilized the masses. It was not enough for the leadership to work without the masses. The masses also reflected that they "couldn't figure it out." The work group realized that if we continued to do this, it would take a long time and we would still not be able to mobilize the masses. We decided to absorb poor peasants and farm laborers into the rectification of the Party. Only then did the masses begin to understand that this work was different from the past.

　　民主整党脱节
  　工作停滞不前
  　宋家庄工作组做了检讨
    【平定消息】五区宋家庄村，是一个三百七十多户的村子，历史上群众对干部不满，四五年解决过一次干群关系，当时分委书记马小山领导群众给干部提意见，提后又说这是反干部，有问题，这样就又领导干部反群众，捆起了二个提意见多的群众，说他们是特务。四六年来了一次反特，干部对群众又来了一个报复，说贫农张竹真等是特务，张被逼自杀，有的被扣挨打。从此村干部就大胆的骑在人民头上作威作福。该村斗争地主三和堂，拿出好多果实，大部被干部贪污侵占了。农会主席王保田，原来只有三亩半地，经过翻身，一人就夺取了二十八亩好地，种的十亩麦子，而贫雇农有的根本没种。一户贫雇分到三亩好地，已上了粪计划种麦，他又夺回来自己种上。群众反映：咱们村是干部种好地，群众种黄沙坡。贷款一百三十万元，干部们以组织小型合作社为名，不给群众分。政治主任孙志成一人就借了十万元。这些事群众不满不敢吭，加之领导上过去犯了官僚主义，不但不检查批评，反而表扬了这一伙人。上月十三日工作组到该村，首先召开了支部会和群众会，讲了告农民书和告党员书，表明了工作组的态度；会后进行了挨门逐户访问，对老组织完全放开不理。这样造成坏干部捣鬼，威吓群众，一部分躺倒了，一部分没大问题的党员干部情绪抵抗。政治主任孙志成大吃大喝，夜间吃扁食，他兄弟孙志刚把骡也卖了。村长张福真说：“这次是二十八戍归天堂，保国忠良无下场。”合作社长讽刺说：“我看到贫农团开会，把我笑下两眼泪。”他们这样活动破坏，没有及时在群众面前揭穿打击，群众看到干部这样态度，更不敢起来；另一方面我们对群众发动上目的性不明确，只是为成立贫农团和收集材料，而没有注意解除群众顾虑和生产要求，这样我们虽组织了贫农小组，但开贫农团会都不说话。妇女白玉峰给我们反映了一些材料，她母亲吐了她一脸，男人打了她一顿。
    根据这个情况，工作组就转变了原来方针，决定二人专整党，其他仍做个别访问，但支部整党是内外不通气，群众摸不清到底是怎回事，群众仍发动不起来，几个坏干部也不作反省，躺倒说：“由上级处理吧”。这样我们检讨没有把群众发动起来，光领导上干群众不干不行，群众也反映是“估不透”。工作组检讨这样作下去，就会拉长时间，又发动不了群众，决定吸收贫雇进行整党，这样群众才初步的了解了这次工作和过去不一样了。
