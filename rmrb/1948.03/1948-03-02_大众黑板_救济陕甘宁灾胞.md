  　Relief for Disaster-Stricken Compatriots in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia

　　The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region used to be a poor place. Under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, production has developed, the economy has prospered, and the people's lives have become better in recent years, turning it into a good place of democracy, freedom, and happiness for the whole country. However, last year, the Chiang-Hu bandit army risked invading, burning, killing, and looting everywhere, making it impossible for the people to live safely. Although most areas have now been recovered, 400,000 people have suffered the most from the Chiang Kai-shek caused disaster. They have no clothes to wear, no food to eat, and cannot carry out spring plowing and production. In addition to allocating and transporting 200,000 shi of public grain to relieve them, our border region government has also issued an appeal to the entire region: hoping that institutions, troops, schools, and everyone will save some things to donate. Because of the long distance and inconvenient transportation, the appeal hopes that we can best donate cash, medicines, and cloth.

  　救济陕甘宁灾胞
    陕甘宁边区过去是个穷地方，在毛主席直接领导下，这几年发展生产，繁荣经济，人民的生活都过好了，变成了全国民主、自由、幸福的好地方。但去年蒋胡匪军冒险进犯，到处烧杀抢掠，弄的人民不能安全生活，现在大部地区虽已收复，但遭蒋灾最重的有四十万人，没衣穿，没饭吃，无法进行春耕生产。咱们边区政府除拨运二十万石公粮救济他们以外，并向咱们全区发了一个号召：希望机关、部队、学校以及每一个人都节省一些东西出来捐助。因为路远，运输不便，号召上希望咱们最好捐助现款、药品、布匹这类东西。
