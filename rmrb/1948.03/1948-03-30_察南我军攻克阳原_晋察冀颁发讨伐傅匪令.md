　　Chahar South Our Army Captures Yangyuan
　　Jin-Chahar-Hebei Issues Order to Punish Bandit Fu
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Chahar-Hebei Front, 28th—On the evening of the 24th, the People's Liberation Army captured Yangyuan County, north of the Sanggan River in Chahar South, annihilating the defending enemy Chahar Provincial Security 9th General Corps and security police, etc. On the morning of the 25th, our army advanced eastward along the river and captured Huashaoying, about 50 kilometers south of Zhangjiakou, wiping out a regiment of Fu bandit's Provisional 17th Division and most of the reorganized cavalry brigade. The results of the battle are still being tallied.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Chahar-Hebei, 28th—Before the various corps set out on their northern expedition, the frontline leaders of the Jin-Chahar-Hebei People's Liberation Army issued an "Emergency Mobilization Order to Punish Bandit Fu Zuoyi" to the entire army, stating: "This time, our army is embarking on an expedition to punish Fu Zuoyi, the public enemy of the people of North China, and making a major advance into the Chiang-occupied areas. This is the glorious combat task of our field army." The mobilization order exposed Fu bandit's willingness to be a loyal lackey of Chiang and the U.S., frantically conscripting soldiers, levying exorbitant taxes, and slaughtering and suppressing the people, as the chief culprit in attacking the Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. It pointed out that now the opportunity for revenge has arrived. The entire army should immediately mobilize, bring out their full set of skills, give full play to their initiative and creativity, bravely advance, annihilate the enemy in large numbers, crush Fu bandit's dark rule, liberate the people of the entire province of Chahar, open up a new situation on the northern battlefield, and fight heroically to thoroughly, decisively, and completely annihilate Fu bandit.
