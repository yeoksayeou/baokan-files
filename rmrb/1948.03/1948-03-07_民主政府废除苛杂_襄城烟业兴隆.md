Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Border, 5th: Under the policy of the democratic government to abolish excessive taxes and protect industry and commerce, over 60 tobacco firms, including Tongda and Yuji, have resumed business in Xiangcheng County, a famous tobacco-producing area in central Henan. In the Beiguan tobacco market, stacks of tobacco bales are piled high like mountains, and farmers from all around selling tobacco clog the roads. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ruled the area, tobacco taxes were extremely heavy, with the regular tax rate alone reaching 60%, more than double the current levy by the democratic government. In addition, various kinds of excessive taxes and extortions by tax checkpoints along the way exceeded the regular tax by several times. Registration procedures were cumbersome, and tobacco bales could not be transported out for ten days or half a month. Now, the democratic government only has one type of tobacco consolidated tax, and the procedures are simple, so tobacco merchants warmly support it. Xiangcheng, Jia County, and Yu County all produce tobacco, but Xiangcheng has the best soil, and the farmers know how to select seeds, so the tobacco leaves produced are of the highest quality in the country and are traditionally shipped to Shanghai and other places. Farmers rely on tobacco cultivation as their main source of income. However, in the past, most of the tobacco land was occupied by landlords and bureaucrats, and the farmers lived in extreme poverty. Now, the democratic government is leading the farmers in carrying out land reform.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: "Harbin is showing signs of recovery and prosperity." This is a fact acknowledged in an Associated Press dispatch quoting an employee of an American company in Shenyang who had just retreated to Qingdao. This employee reportedly visited Harbin and said: "Many new factories have opened in Harbin, and electricity and coal are abundant and very cheap. Coal, which could not be bought at any price in Manchurian cities controlled by the (Chiang Kai-shek) government, costs only 560,000 (Nationalist) currency per ton in Harbin (generally, the price of coal in Chiang's areas is between 2 million and 4 million). The employee admitted that "the people's lives have improved noticeably over the past year." He also admitted that all of this is "completely different" from the distorted "reports" by the Chiang Kai-shek news agency that "Harbin is a desolate city."

　　民主政府废除苛杂
  　襄城烟业兴隆
    【新华社豫陕鄂五日电】豫中产烟名地襄城县，在民主政府废除苛杂，保护工商业政策下，全城已有同大、裕记等六十多家烟行恢复营业。北关烟市场，烟包堆积如山，四乡卖烟农民挤塞道路。蒋匪统治该地时，烟税极重，仅正税税率达百分之六十，已超过现民主政府的征收一倍，此外各种苛杂，及沿途税卡敲榨勒索，更超过正税数倍。登记手续繁琐，烟包十天半月不能外运。现民主政府只有烟统税一种，手续简便，因此，烟商莫不热烈拥护。按襄、郏、禹三县都产烟，襄城土壤最好，农民又知选种，所产烟叶是全国上品，一向运销上海等地。农民以种烟为主要收入。但过去烟地大部为地主、官僚所占，农民生活极苦，现民主政府正领导农民进行土地改革。
    【新华社陕北五日电】“哈尔滨呈现着恢复繁荣的气象”。这是美联社电讯引据刚刚撤退到青岛的沈阳某美国公司职员的谈话所承认的事实。该职员据说曾到过哈尔滨，他说：“哈尔滨许多新工厂开办了，电和煤很丰富，而且极便宜。在（蒋匪）政府控制的满洲城市无论如何都不能买到的煤，哈市每吨仅合法（蒋）币五十六万元（按蒋区煤价一般皆在二百万到四百万之间）。该职员承认“过去一年人民生活显而易见的改善了”。并承认这一切与蒋匪通讯社所歪曲“报导”的“哈尔滨是个荒凉的城市”，“截然不同”。
