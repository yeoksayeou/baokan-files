Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: Hong Kong Dispatch: The Kuomintang Democrats have declared a split with Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. At the Kuomintang Democratic Faction Congress held in Hong Kong last December, the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang was established as its leading body, with key figures including Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Feng Yuxiang, and Li Zhangda. They issued a declaration and action program on New Year's Day this year. The declaration denounced Chiang Kai-shek for betraying the revolutionary cause of Sun Yat-sen and Liao Zhongkai and implementing a traitorous dictatorship. It emphasized the indivisibility of the two major tasks in the Three Principles of the People—anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism—as well as the indivisibility of these two major tasks from the three great policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants. It believes that "only by overthrowing Chiang and not opposing the U.S. reactionary faction's imperialist policy of undermining China's democracy and peace can Chiang's reactionary dictatorial regime be overthrown; the second anti-democratic regime supported by the U.S. reactionary faction may still be established." The Three Great Policies applied to the present should mean expanding alliance with Russia to alliance with all nations in the world that treat us equally; alliance with the Communist Party should be expanded to alliance with the Chinese Communist Party, the Democratic League, and other parties; and assisting workers and peasants should implement "land to the tiller" and "guaranteeing workers freedom from unemployment and starvation." The important points in the action program include: "The basic principle of this committee's action program is the foreign and domestic policies decided by the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang"; "The current revolutionary task of this committee is to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial regime and realize China's independence, democracy, and peace"; "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial political system, deny his forged National Assembly, forged constitution, and forged government organization"; "Oppose the U.S. reactionary faction's interference in China's internal affairs and its policy of fueling China's civil war, support the people in rising up to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops and advisory groups from China, the cessation of military and financial aid to Chiang, and non-recognition of all traitorous loans and Sino-U.S. commercial treaties signed by Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government"; "Establish a democratic regime elected by universal suffrage of the people of the whole country to replace Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorial regime. Before the establishment of a democratic government elected by universal suffrage, a coalition government composed of representatives of various democratic parties and democratic figures from all walks of life will be jointly organized as the supreme political power organ during the transitional period."

　　国民党民主派与蒋党分裂
  　国民党革命委员会成立
    主张实行三大政策倒蒋反美
    巩固扩大民族民主统一战线，打倒卖国贼蒋介石！
    【新华社华中六日电】香港通讯：国民党民主派已宣告与蒋介石的国民党分裂。去年十二月在香港举行的国民党民主派代表大会上，产生了国民党革命委员会为自己的领导机关，主要人物有李济琛、何香凝、冯玉祥、李章达诸人，并于今年元旦发表宣言及行动纲领。宣言内容指斥蒋介石背叛孙中山、廖仲恺的革命事业，实行卖国独裁；强调三民主义中反帝国主义与反封建两大任务的不可分性，以及这两大任务与联俄、联共、工农三大政策的不可分性。认为“只有倒蒋而不反对美国反动派的破坏中国民主与和平之帝国主义政策，则蒋氏之反动独裁政权纵被推翻，美反动派支持下的第二个反民主政权，仍有成立可能”。三大政策应用于目前，联俄应扩大为联合世界上以平等待我之民族；联共应扩大到联合中共、民盟等党派，扶助工农应实行“耕者有其田”，“保障劳动者免于失业饥饿”。行动纲领中，重要者有：“本会行动纲领，以中国国民党第一次全国代表大会决定之对外对内政策为基本原则”；“本会当前之革命任务为推翻蒋介石独裁政权，实现中国之独立民主与和平”；“反对蒋介石之独裁政治体制，否认其伪造的国民大会，伪制的宪法，伪定的政府组织”；“反对美国反动派干涉中国内政，助长中国内战之政策，扶助人民起来要求美军及顾问团退出中国，停止军事及财政援蒋，不承认蒋介石独裁政府之一切卖国借款及其签订之中美商约”；“成立由全国人民普选产生之民主政权代替蒋介石的卖国独裁政权，在普选产生之民主政府未成立以前，联合组织各民主党派与各界民主人士代表之联合政府为过渡期间之最高政治权力机关”。
