　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—Reports from various sources: The formation of the new National Front cabinet in Czechoslovakia has been greeted with enthusiastic cheers from world democratic public opinion and has also caused panic and wailing among international reactionaries. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party sent a telegram to the Czechoslovak Communist Party on the 26th, congratulating them and stating that the establishment of the Gottwald new government "is a major victory for democracy over reaction." Newspapers in various new democratic countries in Eastern Europe have also written articles to express their joy and congratulations. The Hungarian "Smallholder's Newspaper" stated: "The rapid resolution of the Czech rebellion is fully in line with the interests of all people who wish to consolidate the friendly cooperation among the countries along the Danube River." "The international reactionaries' attempt to obstruct the democratic development of Czechoslovakia has been completely shattered." The famous Soviet writer Polevoy, who is currently a special correspondent for Pravda in Prague, praised in his correspondence: "The Czech people are brave and steadfast, and no threat can stop them from choosing the path of freedom and democracy." On the side of the international reactionaries, "the American ruling class has aroused great unease" (TASS). On the one hand, they immediately declared: to "reduce the export of heavy machinery to Czechoslovakia, freeze Czech funds in the United States, and stop the $20 million cotton purchase loan from the Export-Import Bank to Czechoslovakia." On the other hand, they united with the British and French governments on the 26th to issue a so-called "Joint Declaration of the Three Countries," ranting that the Czechoslovak Communist Party had established a "one-party dictatorship." The reason why the reactionaries in the United States and Britain are so angry is that "the Czech rebel group was led by the US and British consulates in Czechoslovakia" (Czech Ministry of Interior Bulletin). As the lackeys of American and British monopoly capital, the Western European reactionaries are particularly panicked and uneasy about the victory of the Czech people. The Italian "Gasperi and Salagate are worried about whether they will win the general election on April 18" (Associated Press, Rome, 26th).

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—Prague News: The entire Czech people are welcoming the great victory of crushing the coup conspiracy of domestic and foreign reactionaries with unparalleled joy. Premier Gottwald has ordered the 26th to be designated as National Day. People from all over the country held meetings to celebrate and firmly expressed their determination to fight for the consolidation of the new people's democratic regime. The organization of the National Front Action Committee is becoming more widespread and in-depth as trade unions call for the establishment of action committees in factories and institutions with more than 20 people. The Action Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun to purge domestic and foreign reactionary diplomats. Action committees have also been formed within various political parties. The most reactionary chairman of the Slovak Democratic Party, Lei Litz, has been removed from his post and replaced by Baroque. Right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, such as former Minister of Grain Mitzel, have been purged from the Central Committee of the party. All Czech newspapers unanimously believe that the establishment of the new National Front cabinet is a remarkable victory for the working people of Czechoslovakia. The Czech Communist Party's Red Flag newspaper pointed out: "The serious obstacles hindering our country from moving towards the socialist road have been cleared, and now we can continue to work peacefully." Obra Na Ridtu newspaper pointed out: "The new National Front government has won the complete trust of the loyal working people, workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals and small property owners across the country. The emergence of the new National Front government is not only a stunning victory in domestic political life, but also represents the failure of the international reactionaries' plan, especially the failure of the US imperialist attempt to turn Czechoslovakia into its anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and anti-democratic stronghold in Europe."

　　捷迅速平服反动派叛乱阴谋
    世界民主舆论同声祝贺
    美英反动派幻想破灭极感惊恐不安
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方讯：捷克新民族阵线内阁的成立，博得世界民主舆论的热情欢呼，也引起了国际反动派的恐慌悲鸣。法共政治局二十六日特向捷共驰电祝贺称：哥特瓦尔德新政府的成立，“是民主对反动的重大胜利”。东欧各新民主国家报纸亦纷纷撰论致其欢欣庆贺之忱，匈牙利“小农报”称：“捷克叛乱的迅速解决，完全符合一切愿望巩固多脑河沿岸诸国亲睦合作的人民的利益”。“国际反动派妄图阻挠捷克民主发展的企图已完全破灭了”。现任真理报驻布拉格特派员的苏联名作家波列伏依，在其通讯中盛赞：“捷克人民勇敢坚定，没有任何威胁足以阻止他们选择自由民主的道路。”在国际反动派方面，“美国统治阶级激起了巨大不安”（塔斯社），他们一面立即宣称：要“减少重机器输往捷克，冻结捷克在美资金，停止进出口银行对捷克的二千万美元购棉贷款。”一面联合英法两国政府于二十六日发表所谓“三国联合声明”，狂吠捷共已建立“一党独裁”。美英等反动派之所以如此恼怒，原因是“捷克叛逆集团系受美英驻捷总领事馆领导”（捷内政部公报）。作为美英独占资本狗腿的西欧反动派，对捷克人民的胜利，尤其恐慌不安，意大利“加斯贝利与萨拉盖特都在忧虑四月十八日的大选能否获胜”（合众社罗马二十六日电）。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】布拉格讯：全捷人民以无比欢欣迎接粉碎国内外反动派政变阴谋的伟大胜利，哥特瓦尔德总理特下令定廿六日为国庆日。各地人民纷纷开会庆祝；并坚决表示为巩固新的人民民主政权而斗争。民族阵线行动委员会的组织，因职工会号召二十人以上的工厂机关即组织行委会而愈见普遍深入。外交部行委会已开始清洗国内外反动外交人员。各政党内部亦组成行委会，最反动的斯洛伐克民主党主席雷立区已去职，由巴洛克继任。社会民主党右派领袖如前粮食部长米泽尔等，已被清洗出该党中央委员会。全捷各报一致认为新民族阵线内阁的成立，是捷克斯拉夫劳动人民的卓越胜利。捷共红旗报指出：“阻碍我国走向社会主义道路上的严重障碍业已清除，现在我们又能继续和平劳动了。”奥布拉那·里都报指出：“新民族阵线政府得到全国忠实的劳动人民、工人、农民、士兵、知识分子与小有产者的完全信任，新民族阵线政府的产生，不但是国内政治生活的惊人胜利，而且也表示国际反动派计划的失败，特别是美帝国主义企图变捷克为它在欧洲反共、反苏、反民主据点的计划的失败。”
