Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th – General Zhao Shoushan, Second Deputy Commander of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, received reporters at the front-line headquarters on the eve of the first anniversary of our army's withdrawal from Yan'an. Discussing the Northwest war situation, he stated, "After our army annihilated 30,000 enemies in the Yichuan area, it continued to expand its powerful offensive, successively liberating and recovering中部 (Zhongbu), 宜君 (Yijun), 白水 (Baishui), 黄龙 (Huanglong), 甘泉 (Ganquan), ＠县 (@ County), and surrounding Luochuan, completely isolating Yan'an. Recently, the Yu-Shaan-E Liberation Army has liberated Luoyang, completely annihilating the defending enemies. From now on, our brother Liberation Army can advance westward and strike eastward with complete freedom. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit's adventurous offensive against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region a year ago has now reached the point where they are reaping what they sowed." General Zhao traced the changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves over the past year, saying, "When Hu Zongnan attacked the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia area last year, his ferocity was high. The strategic policy of the Liberation Army was to eliminate the enemy's effective strength, not to focus on the gains and losses of a single city or place. Now, after only a short year, Hu Zongnan has lost a army headquarters, five division headquarters, six brigade headquarters, seven whole brigades, and fifteen whole regiments. Including the annihilation of entire battalions and companies, this amounts to the equivalent of more than fifty-two regiments, totaling approximately 100,000 troops. After the Liberation Army eliminates the enemy's effective strength, the day of recovering Yan'an and liberating the Northwest will be accelerated." General Zhao then issued a sincere warning to the Northwest local troops who were selling their lives for Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan on the Northwest battlefield, such as the 30th Division, formerly of Sun Lianzhong's old Northwest Army, the 17th Division, formerly of Gao Guizi's old Shaanxi Army, and the 38th Division, formerly of General Yang Hucheng's old troops: "Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's defeat is certain. Do not continue to assist them in doing evil, harming the people, but should quickly awaken, resolutely lead the entire army to revolt, stand on the side of the people, and jointly complete the cause of liberation; or withdraw from the civil war, lay down your weapons, save yourselves and save others." General Zhao also particularly advised Ningxia and Qinghai's Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongbin, Ma Buqing, and Ma Bufang, saying, "The Liberation Army's policy towards ethnic minorities is to support their development, advocating ethnic autonomy, which is fundamentally different from Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's Great Han chauvinism that oppresses ethnic minorities. I hope you will consider the interests of the Hui people, recognize the general trend, the will of the people, and no longer assist Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan in doing evil. Even Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's well-equipped direct line troops cannot stop the Liberation Army's offensive. What is the quality of your equipment? Why do you still want to be their meaningless sacrifices?" General Zhao, filled with local sentiment, called on the elders, enlightened gentry, patriotic retired soldiers, and all the people's armed forces in the Northwest to quickly prepare their strength, welcome the People's Liberation Army, cooperate with the Liberation Army in combat, and jointly end Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's more than ten years of brutal rule in the Northwest, and jointly complete the great cause of liberating the Northwest. General Zhao was in high spirits during the conversation. At the age of fifty-five, with graying temples, he personally visited the front lines with Deputy Commander Peng during the Yichuan campaign, inspected the positions, and directed the battle. He was extremely vigorous. General Zhao said, "I am most honored to be appointed by the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. As a member of the Liberation Army, I should contribute all my strength to the cause of the people's liberation." After the great victory in Yichuan, General Zhao wrote two poems to express his feelings. The first one is: "Spring opens in Huanglong, snow fills the sky, the enemy and I fight in Yichuan; thirty thousand bandits are swept away, laying the foundation for the victory year of Wuzi." The other one is: "Invading Yan'an like wolves, but now they are no better than sheep; the poor masses seek liberation, and the ruling oligarchs cannot succeed."

　　赵寿山将军纵谈西北战局
  　胡匪一年来被歼十万
    号召西北蒋军掉转枪口站到人民方面来
    【新华社西北二十五日电】西北人民解放军第二副司令员赵寿山将军于我军退出延安周年前夕，在前线司令部接见记者，纵谈西北战局称：“我军在宜川地区歼敌三万以后，继续扩张强大攻势，已先后解放和收复中部、宜君、白水、黄龙、甘泉、＠县，包围了洛川，使延安完全孤立。日前豫陕鄂解放军已解放洛阳，全歼守敌，今后我兄弟解放军西进东击，完全自如，蒋胡匪一年前对陕甘宁边区发动的冒险进攻，现在已到了自食其果的时候了”。赵将军追溯一年来敌我力量的变化说：“去年胡宗南进攻陕甘宁时，凶焰高涨，而解放军的战略方针是消灭敌人有生力量，不在一城一地的得失，现在才经过短短的一年，胡宗南已损失了一个军部、五个师部、六个旅部、七个整旅、十五个整团，把整营整连被歼的计算在内共折合五十二个多团，共约兵力十万人。解放军在消灭敌人有生力量之后，收复延安和解放西北的日子就要加速的到来。”赵将军继对西北战场上为蒋胡卖命的西北地方军，如原西北军孙连仲旧部整三十师，原陕军高桂滋旧部整十七师，原杨虎城将军旧部的整三十八师等发出忠告说：“蒋胡败局已定，勿再助彼为恶，残害人民，而应赶快觉醒，毅然率领全军起义，站到人民方面来，共同完成解放事业；或者退出内战，放下武器，自救救人。”赵将军并特别劝宁青马鸿逵、马鸿宾、马步青、马步芳称：“解放军对少数民族的政策是扶助其发展，主张民族自治，与蒋胡压迫少数民族的大汉族主义根本不同，希望你们为回族计，认识大势所趋，民心所向，勿再助蒋胡作恶。蒋胡装备优良的嫡系部队也挡不住解放军的进攻，你们的装备如何，为什么还要替他们作无谓牺牲品呢？”赵将军尤满怀桑梓之情，号召西北父老、开明绅士、在乡爱国军人及一切人民武装，赶快准备力量，迎接人民解放军，协同解放军作战，合力结束蒋胡在西北十余年的暴虐统治，共同完成解放西北的大业。赵将军谈话时，情绪兴奋，彼年已五十五岁，鬓发斑白，此次宜川战役中和彭副总司令一起亲临前线，视察阵地，指挥作战，精神极为健旺。赵将军称：“我受人民解放军总部的任命是生平最光荣的事，我身为解放军的一员，当为人民解放事业贡献自已的一切力量。”在宜川大捷后，赵将军曾作诗两首述感，第一首是：“春开黄龙雪满天，敌我角斗在宜川；三万胡虏一扫尽，奠定戊子胜利年。”另一首是：“分犯延安好似狼，而今看它不如羊；贫苦大众求解放，统治寡头难逞强。”
