　　Jin-Sui Farmers Prepare for Spring Plowing
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 3rd] With the spring warmth thawing the ground, farmers in various parts of Jin-Sui are stepping up preparations for spring plowing. On the 24th of last month, Wu Xinyu, Director of the Administrative Office, made a special call at the Spring Plowing Mobilization Meeting in Xing County for farmers to get rich through labor and build a family through production. He pointed out that after the land certificates were issued, the private ownership of land has been determined, and farmers have the freedom to dispose of their land and property. The government resolutely protects the legitimate wealth obtained through labor. Currently, farmers in Dayukou, Huai'ren County, are taking advantage of the spring floods to divert water for irrigating their fields in order to sow spring wheat before land distribution. The labor costs for irrigation will be calculated after the land is distributed. Xidouyu Village in Shenfu County is starting construction on eight wells to transform nearby dry land into paddy fields. In order to solve the spring famine, Baode and other counties have decided to plant more summer crops and vigorously develop industries such as saltpeter boiling and weaving. Shuo County is mobilizing farmers to cut wild grass to prepare fodder for livestock. Farmers in various places have begun delivering manure. After reorganizing their teams, trade bureaus and state-owned stores in various places are making every effort to help farmers solve the difficulties of spring plowing. Shuo County, Dai County, Wuzhai, Shenchi, Xing County and other counties have helped farmers buy back more than 24,000 stone of seeds. The trade bureaus of Shuo and Dai counties have also bought back hundreds of head of draft animals and many farm tools and fertilizers. In addition: Last winter, trade bureaus and state-owned stores in various places organized mass transportation. On the Shenchi-Kelan line, there were often 800 large carts transporting goods. The Jiaocheng Trade Bureau organized the masses to transport grain, earning more than 22,000 jin of grain in freight fees, which solved part of the winter difficulties and spring grain rations.
