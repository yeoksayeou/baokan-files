Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th. The People's Liberation Army recaptured Yongji, the provincial capital of Jilin, at 11:00 AM on the 9th. The defending enemy, the 60th Army, abandoned all their belongings and heavy equipment and fled towards Changchun. We are currently in pursuit. Yongji, the provincial capital of Jilin, was occupied by the enemy on May 28th of the year before last. Since the autumn offensive last year, it has been surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. With this recapture, the enemy's important isolated strongholds north of Shenyang are now only the two besieged cities of Changchun and Siping.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to reports from Shenyang and Nanjing by the American Imperialist Associated Press on the 4th of this month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shenyang are extremely panicked, and Chiang's troops are universally weary of war. "Most of these soldiers are from Central and Southern China and have been in Shenyang for two years. Their desire to return home surpasses everything else, and they know that if they do not defect to the Communist side, they will not be able to return to their hometowns." The evacuation of the families of some Chiang government officials and prominent Chiang military generals from Shenyang has made the remaining Chiang personnel even more panicked. The Associated Press also revealed that the economic crisis in Shenyang and the entire Kuomintang-controlled area of ​​Northeast China "is on the verge of collapse," and that "the city seems dead, with shops closed and no smoke coming from the chimneys." "Although a small amount of flour is continuously transported by air, the grain shortage situation in Shenyang is worsening day by day. Prices in Shenyang have risen to three times those in Beiping and Tianjin, and five times those in Shanghai and Nanjing." Due to the Chiang bandits' and Chiang troops' brutal extortion, citizens are even "committing suicide in entire families due to economic hardship."

Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 11th. A certain unit of the Fourth Military Sub-district's local armed forces captured Jingziguan, a vital transportation hub in Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, at 1:00 PM on the 7th. The four battalions of local Chiang bandits guarding the area were completely wiped out, except for more than a hundred who fled. We captured over 800 bandits, including bandit regiment commander Guan Zhili, and killed or wounded over 100. We seized nine light machine guns, over 400 rifles, and 110,000 rounds of ammunition. We only suffered eight wounded and one killed.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 11th. A certain unit of the Fourth Military Sub-district's local armed forces cleared out Chiang's local bandits in the Liangchahe Milangchuan area, 60 li east of Zhen'an City, on the 2nd, capturing 107 bandit security police and other officers and soldiers alive and killing nine. On the same day, another unit raided Tiechangpu, annihilating the 8th Company of the 9th Regiment of the bandit security forces and the township office, capturing 111 bandits, including the company commander and township head, and killing or wounding 20. On the 4th, this unit again attacked Xitaipinggou, capturing 43 bandits, including the village head. In the three battles, a total of one light machine gun and 103 rifles and native-made guns were seized. (Attached picture)

　　东北我军收复永吉
  　豫陕鄂地方武装打下荆紫关
    【新华社东北十一日电】解放军九日上午十一时收复吉林省城永吉，守敌六十军尽弃细软辎重，向长春方向逃窜，我正追击中。按吉林省城系于前年五月二十八日为敌侵占，自去年秋季攻势以后，即为解放军围困，此次重获解放，敌在沈阳以北孤立的重要据点，已仅余长春及四平两座死城。
    【新华社陕北十日电】据美帝合众社本月四日自沈阳及南京报导透露，沈阳蒋匪十分恐慌，蒋军普遍厌战。“这些士兵大部分是华中、华南人，已在沈阳呆了两年，回家的要求逾于一切，而且他们知道如果不跑到共产党方面去，他们是返回不了他们的家乡的。”由于若干蒋政府人员及蒋军显要将领家属的撤离沈阳，使留下的蒋方人员更为恐慌。合众社并透露沈阳及整个东北国民党统治地带的经济危机“已临崩溃”，“城似乎是死的，商店都紧闭店门，烟突上也没有轻烟。”“虽然少量的面粉不断由空中运来，沈阳粮荒的情势仍日益恶化。沈阳物价已上涨到北平、天津的三倍，上海、南京的五倍。”由于蒋匪蒋军的残暴勒索，市民甚至“有整家整家因为经济困难而自杀的。”
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十一日电】四分区地方武装某部，七日下午一时攻克豫陕鄂交通咽喉荆紫关。据守该地之土蒋匪四个营，除百余名逃窜外，全部被歼。我共俘匪团长关之理以下八百余人，毙伤一百余。缴获轻机枪九挺，步枪四百余支，子弹十一万发，我仅伤八名，牺牲一名。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十一日电】四分区地方武装某部二日在镇安城东六十里的两岔河米良川地区，清剿蒋土匪，生擒匪保警队等官兵一百零七名，击毙九名。同日另部奔袭铁厂铺，歼匪保九团第八连及乡公所等，俘匪连长乡长以下一百一十一名，毙伤二十名。四日，该部又袭西太平沟，俘匪保长以下四十三名，三次战斗共缴获轻机枪一挺，步枪土枪一百零三支。（附图片）
