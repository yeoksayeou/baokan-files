　　Welcome Yugoslavian Guests
    At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, Mr. Vukmanović, Vice President of the Federal Executive Council of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia, has come to our country for a friendly visit. We extend a warm welcome to the distinguished guests from Yugoslavia and believe that this important visit will help enhance mutual understanding and cooperation between China and Yugoslavia, and help strengthen the unity of socialist countries and the cause of world peace.
    The people of our two countries, China and Yugoslavia, have a historical and traditional friendship. As early as the years of World War II, the people of our two countries sympathized and supported each other in the common struggle against fascist aggression and for national independence and liberation, and drew encouraging strength from each other's struggles. The people of our two countries have experienced difficult combat roads, and finally achieved the great victory of national liberation and social emancipation. This provides favorable conditions for the further development of friendly relations between our two countries after the formal establishment of diplomatic relations. It can be said that in the past two years or more, good cooperative relations in politics, economy, culture and other aspects have been established and developed between the governments and peoples of our two countries. In this cooperation, we have given each other support and help. The Yugoslav government and people have consistently given sincere support to the struggle of the Chinese people to safeguard their legitimate rights and status in international affairs and the United Nations, and to strive for the restoration of national territorial integrity. This is something we cannot forget. The friendly cooperation between our two countries has achieved beneficial results, which is not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also contributes to the enhancement of overall international cooperation.
    Now the people of our two countries are advancing on the road of building socialism. We also agree on many international issues. This consistency in basic aspects is the foundation for friendly cooperation between our two countries.
    In order to maintain peace and strive for the complete victory of the socialist cause, not only the efforts of the people of each socialist country are needed, but also the unity and cooperation between socialist countries must be strengthened on the basis of equality and mutual assistance. In order to achieve the goal of unity, it is first necessary to affirm the common ground in basic aspects, and to respect each other's achievements and experiences in socialist construction under different historical conditions. Exchanging these experiences between socialist countries will also continuously promote the advancement of the entire socialist cause. We are pleased to see that recently, due to the efforts of socialist countries, the unity between socialist countries has been further strengthened. The parties and governments of many socialist countries have held bilateral or multilateral talks. It is particularly worth pointing out that the comradely meeting of the leaders of the parties of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria in Moscow in July this year, and the talks between the delegations of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in Romania in early August this year, played an important role in strengthening the unity of socialist countries. These facts show that as long as socialist countries strictly abide by the guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism and make efforts with each other, certain differences that cannot be completely resolved for a while cannot hinder the enhancement of friendly relations between socialist countries and the unity of the international workers' movement.
    Yugoslavia has made important achievements in socialist construction. At the same time, Yugoslavia is also carrying out extensive and active activities in international affairs. Yugoslavia advocates disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and it strives to promote the active peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. Yugoslavia supports the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against colonialism and for the achievement and consolidation of national independence, and is developing good relations with neutral countries such as India, Burma and Egypt. Before visiting our country, Mr. Vukmanović not only visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but also visited Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and Japan. After visiting our country, he will continue to visit Southeast Asian countries such as Burma, India, Ceylon and Pakistan. This is a further implementation of Yugoslavia's peaceful coexistence foreign policy. These activities carried out by Yugoslavia on the international stage in recent years have played a beneficial role in easing international tensions and promoting international cooperation.
    Comrade Vukmanović's visit to our country as a senior official of the Yugoslav government is an important step in developing relations between China and Yugoslavia. We believe that this visit will make an important contribution to the development of friendly relations between China and Yugoslavia and the strengthening of the unity of socialist countries.

### 欢迎南斯拉夫贵宾

　　欢迎南斯拉夫贵宾
    南斯拉夫人民共和国联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇应我国周恩来总理的邀请，来到我国进行友好访问。我们对来自南斯拉夫的贵宾表示热烈的欢迎，并且相信这次重要的访问，将有助于增进中南两国之间的相互了解和合作，有助于加强社会主义各国的团结和世界的和平事业。
    我们中南两国人民具有历史的传统的友谊。还在第二次世界大战的年月里，我们两国人民就在反抗法西斯侵略、争取民族独立解放的共同斗争中，相互给予了同情和支持，并且从各自的斗争中取得了鼓舞的力量。我们两国的人民都同样经历过艰难的战斗道路，最后都获得了民族解放和社会解放的伟大胜利。这就给我们两国在正式建交以后进一步发展友好关系提供了有利的条件。可以说，近两年多来，在我们两国的政府之间和人民之间，已经建立和发展了政治、经济、文化等各方面的良好的合作关系。在这种合作中，我们相互地给予了支持和帮助。南斯拉夫政府和人民，对于我国人民为维护自己在国际事务和联合国中的合法权利与地位，为争取恢复国家领土完整而进行的斗争，一贯给予真诚的支持。这是我们所不能忘记的。我们两国之间的友好合作已经获得了有益的成果，这不仅对我们两国人民有利，而且也有助于整个国际合作的增进。
    现在我们两国人民都在建设社会主义的道路上前进。对于许多国际问题的看法，我们也是一致的。这些基本方面的一致，正是我们两国进行友好合作的基础。
    为了维护和平和争取社会主义事业的彻底胜利，不但需要各个社会主义国家本国人民的努力，同时也需要在平等互助的基础上加强社会主义各国之间的团结和合作。而为了达到团结的目的，就需要首先肯定彼此在基本方面的共同点，并且相互尊重各个国家在不同的历史条件下所取得的社会主义建设的成就和经验。在各个社会主义国家之间相互交流这些经验，也就会不断地推动整个社会主义事业的前进。使我们感到高兴的是，最近以来，由于社会主义各国的努力，社会主义国家之间的团结有了进一步的加强。许多社会主义国家的党和政府都进行了双边的或多边的会谈。特别值得指出的是，今年7月在莫斯科举行的苏联、南斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚四国党的领袖的同志式会见，以及今年8月初在罗马尼亚举行的苏联和南斯拉夫两国党政代表团的会谈，对加强社会主义国家的团结起了重要的作用。这些事实说明，社会主义国家，只要严守马克思列宁主义的指导原则并彼此进行努力，某些一时得不到完全解决的分歧，并不能妨碍社会主义国家之间友好关系的增进和国际工人运动的团结。
    南斯拉夫在社会主义建设中已经取得了重要的成就。同时，在国际事务中南斯拉夫也进行着广泛的积极的活动。南斯拉夫主张裁减军备和禁止原子武器与氢武器，它努力增进不同社会制度国家的积极和平共处。南斯拉夫支持亚非各国人民为反对殖民主义、争取与巩固民族独立而进行的斗争，并且同印度、缅甸和埃及等中立国家发展着良好的关系。伏克曼诺维奇这次来访我国之前，不但访问了越南民主共和国，而且也曾访问了印度尼西亚、泰国、柬埔寨和日本。在访问我国之后，他还将继续访问缅甸、印度、锡兰和巴基斯坦等东南亚国家。这是南斯拉夫和平共处外交政策的进一步贯彻。南斯拉夫几年来在国际舞台上所进行的这些活动，对缓和国际紧张局势和促进国际合作的事业起了有益的作用。
    伏克曼诺维奇同志作为南斯拉夫政府的高级负责人这次来访我国，是发展中南两国关系的重要步骤。我们相信，通过这次访问，将对发展中南两国的友好关系和加强社会主义各国的团结作出重要的贡献。
