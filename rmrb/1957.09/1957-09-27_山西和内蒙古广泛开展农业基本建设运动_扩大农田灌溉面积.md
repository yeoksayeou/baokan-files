Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th - An agricultural basic construction movement, mainly focusing on farmland water conservancy and soil and water conservation, is gradually unfolding in Shanxi Province.

The movement started earlier in the Yanbei and Xinzhou areas, where frost is beginning. Since mid-August, more than 90,000 farmers in the Xinzhou area have been working hard to dig canals, sink wells, and build reservoirs and ponds every day. The more than 2,200 completed water conservancy projects and more than 900 wells can expand the irrigated area by more than 93,000 mu. In Xingxian, Hequ, Baode and other nine counties, after the autumn harvest, farmers began soil and water conservation on the slopes, hills, and gullies. In the past ten days, the newly built more than 33,000 stone dams and more than 22,000 mu of terraced fields in these counties can control soil and water loss in an area of more than 75,000 mu.

Most of the agricultural cooperatives in the Jinan, Yuci, and Changzhi areas are currently harvesting autumn crops while preparing for basic construction. The number of agricultural cooperatives starting construction is increasing daily.

The agricultural basic construction movement, which started early in Shanxi Province, emerged after the widespread展開 of the大 debate in rural areas. The Provincial People's Committee has initially determined that the province will vigorously carry out agricultural basic construction from now until next spring, expanding the irrigated area by 2 million to 2.5 million mu and controlling soil erosion in an area of 13 million mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 26th - The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has decided to expand the irrigated area of farmland by 2 million mu next year, bringing the total irrigated area of farmland in the region to 14.2 million mu. This was determined at the Autonomous Region's Farmland and Pastoral Area Water Conservancy Work Conference, which closed in Hohhot yesterday.

The meeting proposed that a mass farmland water conservancy construction movement should be launched in all agricultural areas of the Autonomous Region this winter and next spring, making use of all water sources in accordance with local conditions, and striving to complete 60% of the annual irrigated area next year this winter and next spring.

The meeting also required all parts of the Autonomous Region to make full use of existing water conservancy conditions to do a good job in the autumn irrigation of 7 million mu.

In addition, the meeting also decided to expand the area of soil and water conservation by more than 3,300 square kilometers next year, focusing on the Yellow River, Yongding River, Wuding River, Laohe River, and Xiliao River within the Autonomous Region. It was also decided to drill more than 1,600 new wells in pastoral areas to further meet the needs of animal husbandry production.

    山西和内蒙古广泛开展农业基本建设运动
    扩大农田灌溉面积
    新华社太原25日电　以农田水利、水土保持为主要内容的农业基本建设运动，正在山西省逐步展开。
    开始霜冻的雁北、忻县两专区，运动展开得较早。忻县专区从8月中旬以来，每天都有九万多农民在紧张地开渠凿井，修建水库和池塘。已经竣工的两千二百多处水利工程和九百多眼水井，可以使水浇地扩大九万三千多亩。兴县、河曲、保德等九个县刚刚秋收完毕，农民们便在山坡、丘陵和沟岔间开始水土保持。十多天来，这些县新修成的三万三千多条石坝谷坊和两万二千多亩梯田，可以使七万五千多亩面积内的水土得到控制。
    晋南、榆次、长治等专区的农业社，目前大部分正在一面秋收，一面准备基本建设。开始动工的农业社逐日增多。
    山西省提前开始的农业基本建设运动，是在农村大辩论普遍展开以后出现的。省人民委员会已经初步确定，全省从现在起到明年春天要大力开展农业基本建设，扩大灌溉面积二百万到二百五十万亩，控制水土流失面积一千三百万亩。
    新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古自治区决定明年扩大农田灌溉面积二百万亩，使全区农田灌溉面积达到一千四百二十万亩。这是昨天在呼和浩特闭幕的自治区农田牧区水利工作会议上确定的。
    会议提出，今冬明春要在自治区各农业区开展一个群众性的兴修农田水利运动，因地制宜地利用一切水源，争取在今冬明春完成明年全年灌溉面积的60％。
    会议还要求自治区各地目前要充分利用现有水利条件，做好七百万亩的秋浇工作。
    此外，会议还决定明年以自治区境内的黄河、永定河、无定河、老哈河、西辽河等为重点，扩大水土保持面积三千三百多平方公里。并确定在牧区打新井一千六百多眼，进一步满足畜牧业生产的需要。
