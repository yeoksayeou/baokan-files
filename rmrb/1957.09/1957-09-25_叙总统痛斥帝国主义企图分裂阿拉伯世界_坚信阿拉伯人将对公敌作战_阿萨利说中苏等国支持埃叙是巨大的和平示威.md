Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 24th: Syrian President Kuwatli said on the 23rd that imperialists are provoking Syria because Syria has rejected the concept of a vacuum, and has declared that any vacuum in the Middle East can only be filled by ourselves.

    Speaking at the graduation ceremony of the Homs Military Academy, Kuwatli said that the most recent provocation of Syria by imperialism was to transport weapons to certain Arab countries, attempting to create the impression around the world that Arabs were about to kill each other, and also attempting to use this to split the Arab world. He said, we firmly believe that foreign weapons in the hands of Arabs will never be used to fight Arabs, but will be used to fight their common enemies. He added that the people are ultimately a force more powerful than armaments, and only they have complete decision-making power.

    He further said: To those people who are provoking us within or outside the United Nations, "we say that the reality of our people and the entire Arab nation will not be changed by movements of incitement, threats, and slander."

    Kuwatli reiterated that Syria's cooperation with the Soviet Union is based on mutual benefit. He refuted the claim that the Communist Party controls Syria.

    Syrian Army Chief of Staff Bizri also spoke at the graduation ceremony. He told the graduating cadets: "You must keep in mind the goals for which our entire nation is striving. You must teach your brothers, friends, and residents to use weapons, so that every Syrian is prepared to deal with any danger."

    Syrian Prime Minister Asali, government ministers, and senior military officers attended the graduation ceremony of the Homs Military Academy. Soviet Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Kotov, who is visiting Syria, also attended the ceremony.

    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 24th: Syrian Prime Minister Asali said on September 23rd that the full support of the Arab people, the Soviet Union and China, and all peace-loving countries in the world for Egypt and Syria is a great demonstration of peace.

    Asali made these remarks when he met with reporters from the Syrian News Agency. He said that this demonstration of peace shows that any adventure against Syria will fail, and will make the conspirators hoist themselves with their own petard.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: According to the Associated Press, the head of the Second Bureau of the Syrian Army General Staff, Sarraj, told the Associated Press on September 23rd that we will fight any country that threatens our independence. Every house, every street, will offer resistance to any aggressor. We will defend ourselves with everything we have, to the last man and the last drop of blood.

    Sarraj said that this is so for "any country that might threaten our sovereignty. Just as you live in Washington and want freedom, I live in Damascus and want to live freely. Syria will not tolerate any control over its affairs." He also said that Syria will never be a satellite state of any country.

    Regarding the relationship between Syria and the United States, Sarraj said that the door to improving relations between Syria and the United States is still open. He pointed out, "This depends on the future actions of the United States." Syria will judge the United States based on its actions.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: New York News: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar accused the United States in New York on September 23rd of launching a campaign against Syria after Syria refused to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine. He said: The role played by Western countries in the Near East "is the cause of all the tensions in the Near East region."

    Bitar said that Syria rejected the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Baghdad Pact, and the proposed Middle East Defense Organization because "Syria wants to base its policies on independence and neutrality." He said: "Only this policy will prevent any foreign interference in the internal affairs of Syria and other Arab countries."

    Bitar condemned Dulles' accusations against Syria in the United Nations General Assembly as unfounded and based on a false premise.

    Bitar said: Syria has not yet decided whether to propose including the Middle East situation on the agenda of the General Assembly. He said: This depends on the development of the situation.

    叙总统痛斥帝国主义企图分裂阿拉伯世界
    坚信阿拉伯人将对公敌作战
    阿萨利说中苏等国支持埃叙是巨大的和平示威
    据新华社大马士革24日电　叙利亚总统库阿特利23日说，帝国主义者对叙利亚进行挑衅，是因为叙利亚拒绝了关于真空地带的概念，并且声明中东的任何真空都只能由我们自己来填补。
    库阿特利在霍姆斯军事学院的毕业典礼上发表演说时说，帝国主义对叙利亚的最近一次挑衅就是把武器运往某些阿拉伯国家，企图在全世界造成一种印象，好像阿拉伯人快要互相残杀，同时也企图借此来分裂阿拉伯世界。他说，我们坚决相信，外国的武器握在阿拉伯人的手里以后就永远不会用来同阿拉伯人作战，而将用来同他们共同的敌人作战。他又说，人民终究是比军火更加强有力的力量，只有他们握有完全的决定权。
    他又说：对于在联合国内或联合国外对我们挑衅的那些人们，“我们说，我国人民和整个阿拉伯民族的现实情况不会因为煽动、威胁和诽谤的运动而发生什么改变”。
    库阿特利重申，叙利亚同苏联的合作是建立在互惠互利的基础上的。他驳斥了所谓共产党控制叙利亚的说法。
    叙利亚陆军参谋长比兹里也在这个毕业典礼上讲了话。他对毕业的学员们说：“你们必须牢记我们全民族为之奋斗的目标。你们必须教会你们的兄弟、朋友和居民使用武器，使每个叙利亚人都作好应付任何危险的准备。”
    叙利亚总理阿萨利、政府各部部长和高级军官都参加了霍姆斯军事学院的毕业典礼。正在叙利亚访问的苏联舰队司令科托夫海军中将也参加了这次典礼。
    新华社大马士革24日电　叙利亚总理阿萨利9月23日说，阿拉伯人民、苏联和中国以及世界上所有爱好和平的国家对埃及和叙利亚的全力支持是巨大的和平示威。
    阿萨利是在接见叙利亚通讯社记者时说这番话的。他说，这种和平示威说明，对叙利亚的任何冒险都将失败，并且使阴谋策划人作茧自缚。
    据新华社24日讯　据美联社报道，叙利亚陆军参谋部第二处处长萨拉杰9月23日对美联社记者说，我们将和威胁我们独立的任何国家进行战斗。每一所房子，每一条街，都将使任何侵略者遇到抵抗。我们将用我们所有的一切来保卫我们自己，直到最后一个人和最后一滴血。
    萨拉杰说，这对“任何一个可能威胁我们主权的国家都是如此。如你住在华盛顿而希望自由，我住在大马士革而将要自由地生活。叙利亚不会容忍对它事务的任何控制。”他还说，叙利亚将永远不会做任何国家的卫星国家。
    在谈到叙利亚和美国的关系时，萨拉杰说，改善叙利亚同美国之间的关系的大门仍旧是开着的。他指出，“这要取决于美国今后的行动。”叙利亚将按照美国的行动来判断它。
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔9月23日在纽约指责美国在叙利亚拒绝接受艾森豪威尔主义之后发动了反对叙利亚的运动。他说：西方国家在近东所扮演的角色“是造成近东地区的一切紧张局势的原因”。
    比塔尔说，叙利亚拒绝了艾森豪威尔主义、巴格达条约和建议中的中东防务组织，因为“叙利亚希望把它的政策建立在独立和中立主义立场的基础之上”。他说：“只有这种政策才会制止任何外国对叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家的内政进行干涉。”
    比塔尔谴责杜勒斯在联合国大会上对叙利亚的指责是没有根据的，是从一个错误前提出发的。
    比塔尔说：叙利亚还没有决定是否建议把中东局势问题列入大会议程。他说：这要取决于局势的发展。
