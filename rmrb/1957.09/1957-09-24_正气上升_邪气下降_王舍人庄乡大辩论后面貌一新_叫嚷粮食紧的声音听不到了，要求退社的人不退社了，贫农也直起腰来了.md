Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 23rd: After a great socialist debate, Wang Sherenzhuang Township in Licheng County, Shandong Province, has seen righteousness ascend and evil decline, taking on a completely new look.

    In this township, cries about grain shortages are no longer heard. The entire township not only no longer requires the state to supply grain, but also, in addition to fulfilling its procurement quota, has decided to sell an extra one million to one and a half million catties of grain to the state. People who were originally determined to withdraw from the cooperative are no longer withdrawing, and many individual farmers are applying to join; in the past, poor peasants did not dare to raise their heads, but now they are standing up straight; wealthy middle peasants who were previously half-hearted now say they want to work well with everyone; previously, landlords and rich peasants said that everyone was a member of the cooperative and all were equal, but now they admit that they have not reformed well and will now honestly engage in labor and reform. Currently, more than 2,700 people in the township are plowing the land and rushing to plant wheat every day, with the attendance rate increasing from 70% to over 95%. The vast majority of the township's wheat sowing work can be completed ten days earlier than last year.

    Before the debate, unhealthy tendencies and evil influences were rampant in Wang Sherenzhuang Township. This summer, many households in the township resolutely demanded to withdraw from the cooperative, and some wavered. Many who were determined to withdraw took back their cattle, refusing to let the cooperative use their farm tools and accumulated fertilizer, and some even planted crops in their original fields behind the cooperative's back. The clamor that there was not enough food to eat was even more widespread. Why did this situation arise? According to revelations from sixteen cooperatives, six cooperatives and twenty-seven production teams were directly controlled by landlords, rich peasants, and wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas. In the period before the debate, they used some shortcomings in the township's work to create chaos, attempting to undermine the cooperative and seize leadership. After more than ten days of great debate, the reactionary arrogance of these landlords and rich peasants has been suppressed, and the broad masses of peasants have recognized the major issues of right and wrong.

    Currently, sixteen of the township's twenty-three agricultural cooperatives have concluded their debates.

    正气上升  邪气下降
    王舍人庄乡大辩论后面貌一新
    叫嚷粮食紧的声音听不到了，要求退社的人不退社了，贫农也直起腰来了
    新华社济南23日电　山东省历城县王舍人庄乡经过社会主义大辩论，正气上升，邪气下降，面貌一新。
    在这个乡里，喊粮食紧的叫嚷声听不到了。全乡不但不再要求国家供应粮食，而且除完成征购任务以外，还确定多卖粮食一百万到一百五十万斤给国家。原来坚决要求退社的人现在不退社了，还有不少单干户申请入社；过去贫农不敢抬头，现在直起腰来了；过去三心二意的富裕中农，现在表示要好好和大家一起干了；以前地主富农说，大伙都是社员，都一般高，现在他们承认自己没有改造好，今后要老老实实地劳动改造。目前，这个乡每天有二千七百多人刨地抢种小麦，出勤率由70％提高到95％以上。全乡小麦播种工作绝大部分可以比去年提早十天。
    王舍人庄乡在辩论以前，歪风邪气很盛。今年夏季，全乡有不少户坚决要求退社，有的动摇。不少坚决要退社的人牵回了耕牛，不让社里使用自己的农具和自己积的肥料，有些人竟背着社在自己原来的地里种上庄稼。叫嚷粮食不够吃的更为普遍。为什么会出现这种情况呢？据十六个社的揭露，其中有六个社和二十七个生产队直接被地主、富农和有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农所把持。他们在辩论以前的一个阶段，利用乡里工作中的一些缺点制造混乱，企图搞垮合作社，夺取领导权。经过十多天的大辩论，现在这些地主、富农的反动气焰被打下去了，广大农民认清了大是大非。
    全乡二十三个农业社，目前已有十六个社辩论结束。
