Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 22nd: The Burmese government refuted on the evening of the 21st a "completely speculative report" recently published by the Rangoon English-language newspaper "The Nation." The report stated that former Thai Minister ? Saroj Tulathat and other exiled Thais had visited Rangoon as guests of the Chinese Embassy in Burma.

The communiqué said: "The Government of the Union of Burma cannot but express regret at the publication of these completely speculative reports, as they may damage the good relations existing between Burma and China."

The Burmese government issued this communiqué because of a recent news item published by "The Nation" stating that Tulathat had visited Rangoon several times as a guest of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, "attempting to confuse certain people in Burma and Thailand through the Free Thai Movement;" and also that Tulathat had "organized a communist Thai movement on an international scale." The communiqué stated, "According to official records, the only person who has recently visited Rangoon is a Mongolian diplomatic courier (whose official duties require him to visit several Southeast Asian countries), and this may be the person whom the 'Nation' of September 19, 1957, identified as ? Saroj Tulathat. Apart from some similarity in their names, this person has nothing to do with Tulathat, who was once the Thai Ambassador to Nanjing." The communiqué also stated: "Moreover, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Rangoon has automatically given the Federal Government a clear guarantee that this news is completely untrue, and the Federal Government has accepted this guarantee."

    仰光“民族报”造谣中伤中缅关系
    缅甸政府发表公报予以驳斥
    据新华社仰光22日电　缅甸政府21日晚驳斥了仰光英文报纸“民族报”最近所刊载的一则“全属猜测的报道”。这条报道说，前泰国部长?沙愿·都拉叻及其他的流亡泰国人曾作为中国驻缅甸大使馆的客人访问仰光。
    公报说：“缅甸联邦政府对于发表这些全属猜测的报道，不能不表示遗憾，因为它们可能损害缅甸和中国之间现存的良好关系。”
    缅甸政府所以发表这个公报，是由于“民族报”最近发表的消息说，都拉叻曾几次作为中国驻缅甸大使馆的客人访问过仰光、“企图通过自由泰国运动来迷惑缅甸和泰国境内的某些人”；又说，都拉叻已经“在国际范围内组织了一个共产主义泰国运动”。公报说，“根据官方记录，最近访问过仰光的唯一的人士是一位蒙古外交信使（他的官方职务使他必须访问几个东南亚国家），可能就是这个人被1957年9月19日的‘民族报’认为是?沙愿·都拉叻。除了他们的名字在有些地方有点类似以外，这个人同曾经当过泰国驻南京大使的都拉叻毫无关系。”公报还说：“不但如此，中华人民共和国驻仰光大使馆已自动地向联邦政府提出明确的保证：这条消息是完全不确实的，联邦政府已接受这个保证。”
