Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd: Yue Shuliang, the vice-director of the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory and a Communist Party member, suppressed criticism and obstructed employees from "airing their views" during the rectification movement. After discovering this, the CPC Hexi District Committee of Tianjin resolutely stopped his erroneous behavior, and the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries has ordered him to suspend his duties for self-criticism.

The factory's employees began "airing their views" on September 11th. On the 12th, Liu Fengming, a personnel section cadre, and his rectification group posted a big-character poster criticizing Yue Shuliang for not going deep enough into his work and for his rigid work style. Yue Shuliang was very annoyed after reading the big-character poster. At a section meeting convened by the personnel section on the 14th, he embarrassed Liu Fengming on the spot. Subsequently, he transferred the cadre work that Liu Fengming was responsible for and had him manage archives instead. Cadre Liu Yuanmao wrote a big-character poster criticizing Yue Shuliang for not following the rules and regulations, taking sick leave without a doctor's certificate, but still being treated as on sick leave and receiving his salary (because leave for personal matters does not pay salary). The next day, Yue Shuliang wanted to transfer Liu Yuanmao away from the director's office under the pretext of "the work not needing him," but he did not succeed because the Party branch prevented it. The Second Workshop office also wrote a big-character poster criticizing Yue Shuliang. Afterwards, Workshop Director Xing Wanhe was deliberately made things difficult for by Yue Shuliang in his work. All of this affected the employees' "airing of views."

The Tianjin Daily, the organ of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee, published a short commentary on this matter on the 21st, saying: The Party has often taught us to value criticism from the masses from below. In this factory and enterprise rectification and socialist education movement, we should adopt a warm welcome and resolute protection attitude towards the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the employees, humbly accept the correct parts, and conscientiously correct them; we must not have any phenomena of not paying attention to or even restricting mass criticism, and even more so, we are not allowed to suppress criticism or retaliate.

    阻挠职工鸣放者戒！
    岳书亮被责令停职检讨
    据新华社天津23日电　天津市公私合营内燃机械制配厂副厂长、共产党员岳书亮，在整风运动中，压制批评，阻挠职工“鸣放”，中共天津市河西区委在发现后已坚决制止了他的错误行为，天津市机电工业局已经责令他停职检讨。
    这个厂的职工从9月11日开始“鸣放”。12日，人事科干部刘凤鸣所在的整风小组贴了一张大字报，批评岳书亮工作不深入，作风生硬。岳书亮看了大字报以后很恼火，在14日人事科召集的科务会上，他便当场给刘凤鸣难堪，随后，他又调换了刘凤鸣负责的干部工作，让刘管理档案。干部刘元茂写了一张大字报批评岳书亮不按制度办事，请假没有大夫证明，却按病假处理，照领工资（因事假不发工资）。第二天，岳书亮就以“工作不需要”为名，要把刘元茂调离厂长室，后因党支部阻止，才没有成功。第二车间办公室也写了一张大字报批评岳书亮，以后，车间主任邢万和在工作中就受到岳书亮的刁难。这都影响了职工“鸣放”。
    中共天津市委机关报——天津日报在21日就这件事发表短评说：党经常教导我们要重视群众自下而上的批评。这次工厂企业开展整风和社会主义教育运动，我们对待职工提出的批评和建议，应当采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的态度，虚心接受其中正确的部分，认真加以改正；决不应有任何不重视以至限制群众批评的现象发生，更不允许压制批评，打击报复。
