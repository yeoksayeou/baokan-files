Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- People from all walks of life in Beijing publicly mourned Lan Gongwu, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, this morning.

At the public memorial service, Dong Biwu, representing the CCP Central Committee, announced the posthumous recognition of Comrade Lan Gongwu as a full member of the Communist Party of China.

The public memorial service was held in Sun Yat-sen Hall, Zhongshan Park. The entrance to Sun Yat-sen Hall was decorated with plain colors. Wreaths from Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai were placed on both sides of Lan Gongwu's coffin. Wreaths and elegiac couplets from other national leaders, various democratic parties, government agencies, and people's organizations were also hung on both sides of the coffin and on the four walls inside Sun Yat-sen Hall.

The public memorial service was presided over by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong.

Those who attended the public memorial service included members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun and heads of various departments, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng and Deputy Procurators-General, Vice Presidents of the Supreme People's Court, Vice Mayors of Beijing, as well as relatives and friends of Committee Member Lan Gongwu.

A total of more than 500 people attended the public memorial service.

As the public memorial service began, the band played funeral music. Presiding officer Chairman Liu Shaoqi presented a wreath to the coffin of Committee Member Lan Gongwu.

Dong Biwu, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and President of the Supreme People's Court, delivered a eulogy. He said that the death of Committee Member Lan Gongwu was a loss to us. Committee Member Lan Gongwu had strong democratic ideas in his early years. Before and after Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor, he wrote articles promoting democratic politics and engaged in activities to overthrow Yuan, ultimately becoming intolerable to the reactionary rule and fleeing abroad alone. He began studying Marxism in 1923, and in his spare time, he lectured young people on "Das Kapital." At this time, he was already envisioning a beautiful socialist future in his mind. After the "September 18th" Incident, Committee Member Lan Gongwu, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, deeply resented Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance. After the "July 7th" Incident, he was confined to Beijing and often used his teaching opportunities to promote anti-Japanese patriotism. Therefore, he was arrested by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in 1940 and imprisoned for one year. In the face of the enemy, although he suffered torture, he remained strong and unyielding, and his anti-Japanese will became even more determined. Before Japan's surrender in the autumn of 1945, Committee Member Lan Gongwu managed to get rid of the enemy's surveillance and resolutely entered the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, embarking on the road of people's democratic revolution with incomparable joy. During the arduous years in the liberated areas, he worked actively. After the founding of New China, Committee Member Lan Gongwu resolutely supported the Party and government's policies for the socialist construction of our great motherland. Although he was old, his sense of responsibility for serving the people was high, and he always worked diligently. In the successive social reform movements, he repeatedly emphasized standing firmly on the proletarian stance and opposing the muddled thinking of failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves.

Dong Biwu said that in May and June of this year, when the bourgeois rightists launched a frantic attack on the Party, Committee Member Lan Gongwu, although unable to move due to illness, was filled with incomparable anger in his heart. He said that in the twelve years since he entered the liberated areas, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, he was not afraid of having no place to exert his strength, not afraid of having difficulties that could not be solved, and the Party and non-Party members treated each other with sincerity, making him feel comfortable and happy. He used his own example to denounce the ridiculous lies of the right-wing ambitious elements about "having positions without power." After the anti-rightist struggle began, although he was hospitalized, he still wrote articles to denounce the right-wing rhetoric. He often said that he wanted to be an extra-Party Bolshevik while alive and a glorious Communist Party member after death. He said that he only felt the meaning of life after he came into contact with the Party. For many years, Comrade Lan Gongwu had faithfully accepted the Party's leadership and hoped to become a glorious Communist Party member. Before his death, he repeatedly applied to join the Communist Party. Comrade Dong Biwu then announced on behalf of the Party Central Committee the posthumous recognition of Comrade Lan Gongwu as a full member of the Communist Party of China.

Dong Biwu concluded by saying that Committee Member Lan Gongwu's life was one of pursuing progress, a life of transitioning from old democracy to new democracy, and to socialism. His simple style, his perseverance, his earnestness, and his selfless spirit are worthy of our eternal remembrance.

Next, Lan Gongwu's son-in-law, Duan Suquan, introduced Lan Gongwu's life and deeds.

At 10:30, the coffin was lifted. Those who assisted in carrying the coffin included Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other personnel who attended the public memorial service.

At 12:00 noon, the remains of Committee Member Lan Gongwu were buried in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.

　　北京各界人民公祭蓝公武
　　中共中央追认蓝公武为正式党员
    新华社12日讯　北京各界人民今天上午公祭全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员蓝公武。
    在公祭大会上，董必武代表中共中央宣布追认蓝公武同志为中国共产党正式党员。
    公祭大会在中山公园中山堂举行。中山堂门前扎着素彩。毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理送的花圈摆在蓝公武灵柩两旁。在灵柩两边和中山堂内四壁还挂满了国家其他领导人员和各民主党派、各机关和人民团体送的花圈和挽幛。
    公祭大会由刘少奇委员长，董必武院长和林伯渠、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通副委员长主祭。
    参加公祭大会的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，国务院秘书长习仲勋和各部门负责人，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞和副检察长，最高人民法院副院长，北京市副市长以及蓝公武委员的亲戚和生前友好。
    参加公祭大会的共有五百多人。
    公祭大会开始时，乐队奏哀乐。主祭人刘少奇委员长向蓝公武委员灵柩献花圈。
    中共中央政治局委员、最高人民法院院长董必武致悼词。他说，蓝公武委员的逝世，对我们是一个损失，蓝公武委员早期有过强烈的民主思想，在袁世凯称帝以前以后，他一面著文宣传民主政治，一面从事倒袁活动，终为反动统治所不容，只身亡命国外。他从1923年开始研究马克思主义，公余之暇并为青年讲授“资本论”。这时，他在思想上已经憧憬着一个社会主义的美丽远景。“九一八”事变以后，蓝公武委员激于爱国热情，对蒋介石的不抵抗主义深为愤恨，“七七”事变以后，他困居北京，常利用教书的机会，宣传抗日爱国，因此在1940年被日本宪兵司令部逮捕，在狱中受刑一年。在敌人面前他虽备受酷刑，但是坚强不屈，抗日意志更加坚决。1945年秋日本投降之前，蓝公武委员设法摆脱了敌人的监视，毅然进入晋察冀边区，以无比愉快的心情，踏上了人民民主革命的道路。在解放区几年的坚苦时期里，他一直积极工作。新中国建立以后，蓝公武委员为了我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设，一直坚决拥护党和政府的方针政策，他虽然年纪已高，但为人民服务的责任心很高，总是辛勤不懈地工作。在历次社会改革运动中，他一再强调站稳无产阶级立场，反对敌我不分的糊涂思想。
    董必武说，今年5、6月间，当资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，蓝公武委员虽然久病不能行动，内心却激起了无比愤怒。他说，他进解放区十二年来，在党和毛主席的领导下，不怕有力量无处发挥，不怕有困难无法解决，党与非党推诚相见，心情舒畅，精神愉快。他以自己为例，斥责了右派野心家所谓“有职无权”的无稽谎言。反右派斗争开始后，他虽然卧病医院，仍然写了文章对右派言论加以痛斥。他常说，生前要做一个党外的布尔什维克，死后愿成为一个光荣的共产党员。他表示，他自从接触了党才感到生活的意义。多年以来，蓝公武同志忠诚地接受党的领导，希望成为一个光荣的共产党员，他临终以前，再三提出参加共产党的申请。董必武同志接着代表党中央宣布追认蓝公武同志为中国共产党正式党员。
    董必武最后说，蓝公武委员的一生是追求进步的一生，是从旧民主转变到新民主、转变到社会主义的一生，他的简朴作风，他的坚毅、认真、无私的精神，是值得我们永远纪念的。
    接着，蓝公武的女婿段苏权介绍了蓝公武生平事迹。
    十时半开始起灵。执绋的有刘少奇委员长和其他参加公祭的人员。
    中午十二时，蓝公武委员遗体在八宝山革命公墓安葬。
