Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th: In Cienfuegos, Cuba, on September 5th, approximately 250 naval personnel and 60 maritime police officers staged an uprising against the Batista dictatorship. The rebels, along with over 400 guerrilla fighters under the leadership of Fidel Castro, occupied the city.

The uprising of the troops in Cienfuegos demonstrates that the armed opposition movement against the Batista regime is expanding from the eastern region of Cuba to the central region. Cienfuegos is a city in Las Villas province in central Cuba. It is located 200 miles southeast of Havana and is a sugar-producing port city with a population of 60,000.

Reports say that the rebels also distributed weapons to some city residents, mobilizing them to fight alongside them against government troops.

Batista is now mobilizing troops from Havana and Santa Clara, north of the city, in an attempt to eliminate the rebels and recapture the city. Government aircraft carried out intense bombing and strafing of Cienfuegos on the 5th.

All traffic in Cienfuegos is paralyzed, and shops are closed.

    古巴人民反独裁斗争扩大
    西恩菲哥斯海军起义
    据新华社6日讯　哈瓦那消息：9月5日在古巴的西恩菲哥斯城大约有二百五十名海军部队和六十名水上警察举行起义，反对巴蒂斯塔的独裁政权。起义者和在菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导下的一部分游击队员一起四百多人占领了这座城市。
    西恩菲哥斯城军队的起义说明古巴的武装反对巴蒂斯塔政权的运动正从古巴东部地区向中部发展。西恩菲哥斯城是古巴中部拉斯维利亚斯省的一个城市。它位于哈瓦那东南二百英里，是一个有六万人口的产糖的海港城市。
    消息说，起义军还把武器发给了一些城市居民，发动他们一起来同政府军作战。
    现在巴蒂斯塔正从哈瓦那和这个城市北部的圣克拉拉城调集军队来企图消灭起义者和夺回这座城市。政府的飞机在5日对西恩菲哥斯进行激烈的轰炸和扫射。
    西恩菲哥斯的全部交通都陷于瘫痪，商店关门。
