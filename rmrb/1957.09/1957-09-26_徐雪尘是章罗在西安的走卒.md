    Xu Xuechen is Zhang-Luo's Accomplice in Xi'an
    Xu Xuechen, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, and the chairman of the Hanzhong Municipal Committee, used the Hanzhong Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League as a base to actively recruit soldiers and horses for the Zhang-Luo alliance, and carried out criminal activities against the Communist Party and against socialism.
    Xu Xuechen has long opposed the leadership of the Party. Comrade Huang Hekun, the Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Hanzhong Municipal Committee, suggested that the League's Municipal Committee inspect the work of the League's group in Hanzhong No. 1 Middle School; Xu flew into a rage upon hearing this, saying, "I object. The school is now on the right track, and no one is allowed to come in." When others occasionally conveyed the Party committee's opinions to him, he said it was "using the Party committee to put pressure on him." He also slandered the Party committee's leadership as "interference" and "nitpicking." He unscrupulously developed the organization. The Hanzhong Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League developed 31 members in Hanzhong City alone in just over a month from the end of April to the beginning of June this year, and continued to develop even after the League Central Committee issued instructions for rectification. When everyone asked Xu Xuechen to explain the reasons and intentions for the large-scale development, he only said that the higher authorities had given him the task, and admitted that Zhang Bojun had spoken to him, but refused to explain what Zhang Bojun had specifically discussed with him.

    徐雪尘是章罗在西安的走卒
    民盟中央候补委员、陕西省委委员、汉中市主任委员徐雪尘以民盟汉中市委为基地，积极为章罗联盟招兵买马，进行反共、反社会主义的罪恶勾当。
    徐雪尘长期反对党的领导。中共汉中市委统战部部长黄河昆同志，建议盟市委检查汉中一中民盟小组的工作；徐听说后大发脾气说：“我反对，现在学校刚上了道，谁也不得进来，”别人有时向他传达党委的意见，他说是“拿党委来压他”。他还诬蔑党委领导是“干涉”、是“挑剔”。他不择手段地发展组织，汉中市民盟在今年4月底到6月初一月多的时间，光在汉中市就发展了三十一人，并且在盟中央发布整风指示后，还在继续发展。当大家要徐雪尘交代搞大发展的原因和用意时，他却只说是上级给他任务，承认章伯钧和他谈过话，但章伯钧到底和他具体谈了些什么？却拒不交代。
