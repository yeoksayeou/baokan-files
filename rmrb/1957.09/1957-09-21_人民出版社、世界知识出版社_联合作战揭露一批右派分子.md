People's Publishing House and World Knowledge Publishing House
Jointly Combat to Expose a Group of Rightists

    (Our Newspaper) News: In the anti-Rightist struggle, People's Publishing House and World Knowledge Publishing House have jointly fought and achieved initial victory in the past two months. The two publishing houses, in coordination with the capital's publishing circles' symposium, toppled Zeng Yanshou, the Deputy Director and Editor-in-Chief of People's Publishing House and a Rightist within the Party; at the same time, they also exposed and criticized a group of Rightists.
    Among the exposed Rightists are Peng Shizhen, member of the China Democratic League and Deputy Director of the Book Editing Office of World Knowledge Publishing House; Dong Qiushui, member of the China Democratic League branch of People's Publishing House and editor of People's Publishing House; and Liu Longguang, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy branch of People's Publishing House and Deputy Director of the Publishing Department. Peng Shizhen and Liu Longguang both attempted to place the Party organization of the publishing house under the leadership and supervision of the China Democratic League and China National Democratic Construction Association organizations. For example, Peng Shizhen promoted his fallacy, saying that mutual supervision should have conditions, and the condition is to implement "prior supervision" over the Communist Party. They also tried their best to slander the Communist Party, describing the Party as a selfish "sectarian group." Dong Qiushui viciously slandered that Party members have three axes for the masses: "First is dogmatism, when dogmatism encounters obstacles, they suppress; if suppression doesn't work, they hit with a stick and put on a hat."
    Another Rightist exposed is Shi Mei, former Director of the Third Editorial Office of People's Publishing House. During the period of great blooming and contending, this Rightist, contrary to his usual attitude of not asking about politics, frantically incited the masses to oppose the rectification leading group and threatened to withdraw from the rectification. He slandered that the Party and the government are the "rulers" of the people, and believed that the various movements carried out by the Party after liberation were all wrong, slandering the mass suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as "unadulterated dogmatism."
    Another Rightist, Zhang Liangmu (leader of the Geography Group of the Editorial Department of People's Publishing House), usurped the leadership of the blackboard newspaper during the blooming period, colluding day and night with Rightists from the two publishing houses, secretly discussing holding a symposium for those dissatisfied with the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, turning the blackboard newspaper into a weapon to attack the Party. He also echoed with the Rightist Zeng Yanshou, allowing Zeng Yanshou to publish a frenzied anti-Party "Answer to Reporter's Questions" on the blackboard newspaper, thus setting off a climax for the Rightists of the two publishing houses to attack the Party.

### 人民出版社、世界知识出版社  联合作战揭露一批右派分子

    人民出版社、世界知识出版社
    联合作战揭露一批右派分子
    本报讯　人民出版社、世界知识出版社在反右派斗争中联合作战，两个月来已经获得初战胜利。两社配合首都出版界座谈会，斗倒了人民出版社副社长兼总编辑、党内右派分子曾彦修；同时还揭发和批判了一批右派分子。
    在揭露出来的右派分子当中，有民盟盟员、世界知识出版社图书编辑室副主任彭世桢，民盟人民出版社支部委员、人民出版社编辑董秋水，民主促进会人民出版社支部主任委员、出版部副主任刘龙光。彭世桢和刘龙光都曾企图把出版社的党组织置于民盟、民建组织的领导、监督之下。例如彭世桢宣传他的谬论，说互相监督要有条件，条件就是对共产党实行“事先监督”，他们还极力诽谤共产党，把党说成是自私自利的“宗派主义集团”。董秋水恶毒地污蔑说党员对群众有三板斧，“先是教条，教条碰壁时就压服，压服不行就打一棍子，戴上一顶帽子。”
    揭露的另一个右派分子是人民出版社前第三编辑室主任史枚。这个右派分子在大鸣大放时期一反平常不问政治的态度，猖狂地鼓动群众反对整风领导小组，并以退出整风相要挟。他诬蔑说党和政府是人民的“统治者”，认为党在解放后搞的历次运动都不对头，诬蔑群众性肃反运动“是不折不扣的教条主义”。
    另一个右派分子张梁木（人民出版社编辑部地理组组长）在鸣放时期篡夺了黑板报的领导权，与两社的右派分子日夜串连，密议举行三反、肃反不满分子的座谈会，把黑板报变成攻击党的武器。他还和右派分子曾彦修一唱一和，让曾彦修在黑板报上发表了疯狂反党的“答记者问”，从此掀起了两社右派分子向党进攻的高潮。
