    Distinguish Right from Wrong on Major Issues, Continue Ideological Remolding
    (Speech at the Enlarged Meeting of the CPC Leading Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association on September 17, 1957)
    Mao Dun
    The thorough criticism and great debate against the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique has been held for twenty-five consecutive sessions. During the meetings, many comrades analyzed the anti-Marxist literary thoughts of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique and exposed their criminal anti-Party and anti-people activities.
    This meeting has had a tremendous educational effect on our literary circles and intellectuals outside of literary circles. This meeting will have far-reaching and positive consequences for raising the ideological level of colleagues in literary circles, strengthening the unity of literary circles, and correctly implementing literary work under the leadership of the Party.
    The Ding-Chen anti-Party clique is only a small group of people, but its main members are veteran Party members and veteran writers, who have a certain position and influence in literary circles. Therefore, their anti-Party activities have caused considerable damage to the Party's cause, the socialist literary cause, and the unity of literary circles.
    The main members of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique have something in common in their literary thoughts, that is, revisionist thought hiding under the guise of opposing dogmatism. Comrade Feng Xuefeng can be regarded as a representative. Xuefeng has written many theoretical articles, some of which contain correct opinions, but on several basic issues, his serious revisionist viewpoints are exposed. Comrades at the meeting have pointed out that Xuefeng's literary thought is basically the same as Hu Feng's literary thought. I think this criticism is pertinent. What plays a leading role in Feng Xuefeng's thought is not Marxism-Leninism but bourgeois subjective idealism.
    Another common point in the ideological qualities of the main members of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique is serious bourgeois individualism. Due to serious individualism, one will inevitably be arrogant and complacent, one will inevitably use double-dealing tactics, one will inevitably place oneself above the Party, becoming someone who only allows him to betray the Party, but the Party cannot control him. One will inevitably grumble, sow discord, expand personal influence, engage in small cliques, and confront the Party. Ding Ling's individualism is particularly serious. Her behavior is always "self-centered," even resorting to unscrupulous means to attack the Party. Feng Xuefeng's anti-Party conspiracy in Shanghai in the past is appalling. After listening to the facts revealed by many comrades at the meeting, some historical issues from the past were completely clarified. It turns out that the disunity in Shanghai's literary circles before the War of Resistance was the result of the collusion and mutual exploitation of Xuefeng's ambition and Hu Feng's ambition!
    Although all right-wing elements have their own faces and their own ways of doing things, they have a "common language" on several fundamental issues.
    Resisting the leadership of the Communist Party is one of their "common languages." Party outside right-wing elements, both in and outside of literary circles, attacked the Party in unison during the period of great contending and blooming. They have two slogans, one is "laymen cannot lead experts," and the other is "non-Party cadres have positions but no power." The first slogan opposes the leadership of the Communist Party from the front, and the second slogan discredits the leadership of the Communist Party from the side. In my opinion, some people who shout "having positions but no power" are actually not fulfilling their duties, and some really want to abuse their power to achieve personal goals or the goals of small cliques. Chu Anping's "Party Empire" is the culmination of their attacks and slanders. They oppose the leadership of the Party because the leadership of the Party hinders their "freedom." Indeed, with the leadership of the Party, there is no "freedom" for them to act recklessly based on selfishness, that is, there is no "freedom" for them to abandon the socialist road and restore capitalism. This is the intention behind their all-out opposition to the leadership of the Party. They not only clamored like this, but also took action. The Zhang-Luo alliance planned to drill loopholes into the literary circles, vainly attempting to seize the leadership, and also planned that if they could not seize the leadership, they would split, pull a group of people out to run a theater troupe, run publications, and put on a rival show.
    These conspiracies of the Zhang-Luo alliance have had internal support from right-wing elements within the Party on many occasions. The Ding-Chen group and the right-wing elements outside the Party, and the members of the Zhang-Luo alliance, have direct and indirect connections. This is not surprising. The reason why the Ding-Chen group became an anti-Party group is because they refused to accept the Party's supervision and leadership of their work. They regarded the work assigned to them by the Party as their own "independent kingdom," which the Party could not criticize or supervise. The reason why they opposed the leadership of the Party is because the leadership of the Party hindered their "free development" from individualism and the expansion of their self-centered ambitions, and because the Party did not allow them to deviate from or distort the Party's literary line. They said that there has been sectarian rule in literary circles for a long time, precisely because they themselves have small cliques and judge others by themselves. The word sectarian has long become the slander of anti-Party elements, and the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng released this poisonous arrow. Bourgeois right-wing elements planned to split the theater troupe and put on a rival show, and the right-wing elements of the "Literary Gazette" editorial department, who were related to the Ding-Chen group, also planned to run their own publications if they could not seize the leadership, and Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and Jiang Feng also planned to launch an open split movement at the next National Congress of Literary and Art Workers.
    The second "common language" of the right-wing elements is to deny the achievements of the country's construction over the past eight years. In literary circles, this is also a chorus of right-wing elements inside and outside the Party. The "gongs and drums of the film" created a disturbance, and Wu Zuguang and his ilk took the stage one after another. Their slanderous and distorted remarks can be summarized by a sentence publicly said by Liu Shaotang (although Liu Shaotang did not conspire with them): In the fifteen years after 1942 (that is, the year of the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art), there were no achievements in literature and art, not as good as the previous fifteen years. Liu Shaotang's sentence is very representative. The right-wing elements verbally support Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," but they do not agree with it in their hearts. Their hidden slanderous method is to deny the great achievements of the literary and artistic movement after 1942, that is, after the "Talks." They say "the present is not as good as the past." Liu Shaotang also said that in the Soviet Union, the literature of the first twenty years was successful, while the literature of the next twenty years was far inferior. The latter twenty years of the Soviet Union are the twenty years in which socialist realism was formally established as the creative method and critical principle that Soviet literary and art workers should abide by. Liu Shaotang said that the latter twenty years were not good, which also implies that after the slogan of socialist realism, Soviet literature declined. Liu Shaotang's view is also the view of some writers and critics in Eastern European people's democratic countries on Soviet literature and socialist realism after the 20th Congress of the CPSU. This view is that only realism is needed, not socialism; this evaluation of the latter twenty years of Soviet literature is a distortion of the facts. However, these erroneous remarks do have a lot of resonance here with us, but only Liu Shaotang has made it public in writing.
    This evaluation of the literary and artistic achievements of the first fifteen years and the last fifteen years of China, or the first twenty years and the last twenty years of the Soviet Union, is not a matter of the level of vision, but whether or not the Leninist principle of Party spirit in literature and art has been adhered to. The ideological source of those erroneous remarks is not starting from the Leninist principle of Party spirit in literature and art, but from the decadent and reactionary literary and artistic viewpoints of the bourgeoisie.
    Suspecting or even opposing the orientation of workers, peasants, and soldiers is also a kind of "common language" of the right-wing elements. Although their tunes are different, their essence is the same. Among them, it seems that no one has publicly opposed the orientation of workers, peasants, and soldiers in writing, but the propositions they hold and spread on other basic issues essentially cancel the orientation of workers, peasants, and soldiers; that is, on the issue of "popularization" and "improvement," and the issue of political standards and artistic standards, they distorted Chairman Mao's thought. The old writer Feng Xuefeng is like this, and the young writer Liu Shaotang is also like this. They say: "Popular" works are low-level (sometimes they say it more politely, then they are popular) works, which are written to adapt to the low cultural level of the people and the masses, and are specially written to achieve propaganda effects. Therefore, the ideological and artistic nature of popular works cannot be high. They completely ignore the main point of Chairman Mao on the issue of "popularization" and "improvement," which is precisely to refute the views of those bourgeois literati who are divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and divorced from politics and who fantasize about "hiding it in famous mountains and passing it on to future generations"; it is precisely to warn us that "popularization" and "improvement" cannot be divided into two parts, but should be viewed dialectically. The facts in literary history also prove that all works that are liked by the people are also works with a high degree of artistry. Thinking that "popular" works are lower-level is an insult to the people and the masses. Chairman Mao's theory of "popularization" and "improvement" is precisely a major component of the orientation of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The distortion of this issue by the right-wing elements is essentially an attempt to cancel the orientation of workers, peasants, and soldiers. On the issue of political standards and artistic standards, their mistakes are equally serious. The proposition that political standards come first and artistic standards come second should not be interpreted as meaning that revolutionary works in content can lack artistry, but to point out that when we evaluate works, the first thing we must consider is its political content. In other words, even if the artistry of the work is high (the skills are good), but the content is unhealthy (not to mention the reactionary content), we must deny it (this is clearly stated in the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"). Therefore, the issue of political standards first and artistic standards second also expresses the issue of class stand. However, the right-wing elements insisted on distorting the issues that Chairman Mao had already clearly instructed, saying that the two standards cannot be separated in order, and used the sentence "the political content of literary works must be expressed through images (artistry)" to "prove" that the two standards cannot be separated, insisting that the reason why formulized and conceptualized works are produced is rooted in these two standards. On this issue, the right-wing elements have completely fallen into the quagmire of the reactionary "supra-class" literary thought of the bourgeoisie.
    Another "common language" of the right-wing elements is to oppose ideological remolding. The ideological remolding of literary and art workers is a long-term and repeated process of strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, participating in struggle, living among the masses, sharing weal and woe with the masses, and strengthening artistic practice. In literary and artistic works, this is the inseparable relationship of the mutual influence of world view, life experience, and creative methods. And among them, the dominant factor is world view. We intellectuals, including literary and art workers, more or less, deeply or shallowly, are all carrying bourgeois ideas. Our world view is complex and contradictory, with positive factors and negative factors, with progressive aspects and backward or even reactionary aspects. If writers with such a non-working-class world view do not remold their thinking first, how can they educate the people with socialist ideas? How does worldview show in the views we take on social reality, and the position we take when approaching our work (artistic practice)? Socialist realism is aimed at these two issues. If we want to strive to master socialist realism, we must first master the Marxist-Leninist world view, and we must remold our thinking. Therefore, emphasizing what "writing the truth" without mentioning the guiding role of world view on "writing the truth," and emphasizing only having life experience without mentioning the necessity of studying Marxism-Leninism, is essentially revisionist thought, and it violates the Party's literary line. The right-wing elements even openly or semi-openly said that the Marxist-Leninist world view restricts the writers from freely exerting their talents. This is truly an absurd fallacy, and it completely distorts the ironclad facts provided by the artistic practice of revolutionary writers from Gorky to today in the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and capitalist countries! All these absurd remarks essentially eliminate the necessity of ideological remolding of literary and art workers.
    These absurd remarks have a market. We must face this fact squarely. The right-wing elements do not want ideological remolding and think that talking too much about Marxism is dogmatism. This is a completely upside-down nonsense! From the perspective of literary and art circles, Marxism is not talked about too much, but too little. Opposing dogmatism and revisionism, opposing naturalism and formalism: this is the struggle on two fronts that the Party is carrying out in literary and artistic work. In recent years, we have not studied this guiding policy well, we have not checked our own thoughts and work according to this guiding policy, and we have not implemented this guiding policy well. This is the reason why there are a large number of right-wing elements in literary and art circles and right-leaning thoughts are popular. It is also the reason why the absurd remarks and conspiratorial activities of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique were able to deceive the sympathy of some literary and art circles. The exposure and criticism of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique is a beginning for us to broadly carry out profound Marxist-Leninist ideological education in literary and art circles following the Party's guiding policy, and to help everyone pass the socialist test. The work of criticism and construction in literary thought and art must be given more importance in the future for the Marxist-Leninist ideological education of literary and art workers, and it must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. We all have a responsibility for this. This anti-rightist struggle has educated each of us. We hope that Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, Chen Qixia and other comrades who have anti-Party words and deeds can truly dissect themselves mercilessly, wash their hearts and reform themselves, and start anew in this struggle; if they are still insincere and hope to muddle through, they will eventually destroy themselves.
    Although the enlarged meeting is over, the struggle will continue to deepen. Carrying out a great debate on the socialist road and the bourgeois road in literature and art throughout the country, and clarifying the major issues of right and wrong, this task is arduous, so we all have to work harder to overcome bourgeois liberalism and individualism, overcome sentimentalism, resolutely criticize anti-Party literary and artistic thoughts, and mercilessly expose anti-Party words and deeds in the deepening and expansion of the struggle, thereby educating ourselves, transforming ourselves, passing the socialist test, strengthening the unity of literary and art circles on a new basis, and developing socialist literature and art.

    明辨大是大非，继续思想改造
    （1957年9月17日在中共中国作家协会党组扩大会议上的讲话）
    茅盾
    彻底批判丁、陈反党集团的大辩论，已经接连举行了二十五次会议。在会议中，许多同志分析了丁、陈反党集团的反马克思主义的文艺思想，揭发了他们的反党、反人民的罪恶活动。
    这次会议给我们文艺界和文艺界以外的知识分子的教育作用是非常巨大的。这次会议，对于提高文艺界同人的思想水平，加强文艺界的团结，正确贯彻在党领导下的文艺工作，都将有深远的良好的后果。
    丁、陈反党集团只是一小撮的人，但其中的主要分子都是老党员、老作家，在文艺界有一定地位和影响，因而他们的反党活动，对于党的事业，对于社会主义文艺事业，对于文艺界的团结，都造成了不小的损害。
    丁、陈反党集团的主要成员们，在文艺思想上有共同之点，这就是躲在反对教条主义的幌子下的修正主义思想。冯雪峰同志可以作为代表。雪峰写过不少理论性的文章，其中也有正确的意见，但在几个基本问题上，却暴露出他的严重的修正主义观点。同志们在会上已经指出：雪峰的文艺思想跟胡风的文艺思想基本上是相同的，我以为这个批判是中肯的。在冯雪峰思想中起主导作用的，不是马列主义而是资产阶级主观唯心主义。
    丁、陈反党集团的主要成员们，思想品质上的另一共同点就是严重的资产阶级个人主义。由于严重的个人主义，就一定会骄傲自满，一定会使用两面派的手法，就一定要把个人摆在党的上面，成为了只许他负党，而党不能管他，就一定要叽叽喳喳，挑拨离间，扩张个人势力，搞小集团，和党对抗。丁玲的个人主义尤其严重，她的行为，处处以“自我为中心”，甚至到了不择手段，向党进攻。冯雪峰过去在上海的反党的阴谋，是骇人听闻的。我在会上听了许多同志所揭发的事实以后，过去的一些历史问题，这才完全弄清。原来抗战前夕，上海文艺界不团结的现象是雪峰的野心与胡风的野心互相勾结而且互相利用的结果！
    所有的右派分子虽然各有各的面目，各有各的作法，但在几个根本性问题上，他们是有“共同的语言”的。
    反抗共产党的领导，这是他们的“共同语言”之一。党外右派分子，文艺界的和文艺界以外的，在大鸣大放期间，异口同声地攻击党。他们有两句口号，一个是“外行不能领导内行”，又一个口号是“非党干部有职无权”。第一个口号是从正面来反对共产党的领导，第二个口号是从侧面来诋毁共产党的领导。我看高喊“有职无权”的人，有的实在是没有尽职，有的实在是想要滥用职权、达到私人目的，或者达到小集团目的。储安平的“党天下”就是集其攻击、诋毁的大成的。他们反对党的领导，就因为党的领导妨碍了他们的“自由”。的确，有了党的领导，就没有了他们的从自私自利出发的胡作非为的“自由”，也就是没有了他们的背弃社会主义道路、复辟资本主义的“自由”。这就是他们之所以要全力来反对党的领导的用心所在。他们不但这样叫嚣而已，而且已经采取了行动。章罗联盟有计划地向文艺界钻空子，妄想夺取领导权，而且也计划到如果夺不到领导权的时候就来个分裂，拉一批人出去办剧团，办刊物，唱对台戏。
    章、罗联盟的这些阴谋，在不少场合是有党内的右派分子作内应的。丁、陈集团和党外的右派分子、和章罗联盟的成员，就有直接的和间接的联系。这是不足为奇的。丁、陈集团之所以成为反党的集团，就因为他们不肯接受党对于他们的工作的监督和领导。他们把党交给他们的工作看成为自己的“独立的王国”，党是不能批评和监督的。他们之所以反对党的领导，就因为党的领导妨碍了他们的从个人主义出发的“自由发展”和自我中心的野心扩张，就因为党不容许他们离开或歪曲党的文艺路线。他们说文艺界长期以来有宗派统治，这正因为他们自己有小集团，以己度人。有宗派这句话，早就成为反党者的谰调，反革命的胡风就是放过这一枝毒箭的。资产阶级右派分子打算分裂剧团，唱对台戏，和丁、陈集团有关系的“文艺报”编辑部的右派分子也曾计划在夺不到领导权的时候自办刊物，而丁玲、陈企霞、江丰也打算在下届文代大会上搞一个公开的分裂运动。
    右派分子的第二个“共同的语言”是否定八年来国家建设的成绩。在文艺界，这也是党内外右派分子的合唱。“电影的锣鼓”敲了闹场，吴祖光之流就陆续上阵。他们的诬蔑歪曲的谰言，可以用刘绍棠所公开说的一句话来概括，（虽然刘绍棠不是和他们预谋的）：1942年（即延安文艺座谈会那一年）以后的十五年间，文艺没有成就，不及以前的十五年。刘绍棠这句话，很有代表性。右派分子口头拥护毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，心里是不赞成的，他们的隐蔽的诽谤方法就是否定“讲话”以后，即1942年以后的文艺运动的巨大成就，他们说“今不如昔”、刘绍棠还说，在苏联，前二十年的文学有成绩，而后二十年则远远不及。苏联的后二十年就是正式确定社会主义现实主义是苏联文艺工作者应当遵守的创作方法和批评原则的二十年。刘绍棠说后二十年不行，也就是暗示，有了社会主义现实主义这个口号以后，苏联文学是衰落了。刘绍棠这个看法，也就是苏共二十次代表大会以后，东欧人民民主国家的有些作家、批评家对于苏联文学以及社会主义现实主义的看法。这一看法，就是只要现实主义不要社会主义；这一种对于苏联后二十年文学的评价是歪曲事实的。但是这些错误的言论，在我们这里确有不少共鸣，不过只有刘绍棠是公开地见之于文字罢了。
    这种对于中国前十五年后十五年或者苏联前二十年后二十年的文艺成就的评价，不是眼界高低的问题，而是有没有坚持文艺的列宁主义党性原则的问题。不从文学的列宁主义党性原则出发，而从资产阶级的腐朽反动的文艺观点出发，是那些错误言论的思想根源。
    怀疑乃至反对工农兵方向，也是右派分子的“共同语言”的一种。虽然他们的调子各不相同，实质上却并无二致。他们之中，好像还没有谁在文字上公然反对工农兵方向，但是，他们在另外一些基本问题上所持的、所散布的主张，却是从实质上取消了工农兵方向；这就是在“普及”和“提高”、政治标准和艺术标准的问题上，他们歪曲了毛主席的思想。老作家冯雪峰是这样，青年作家刘绍棠也是这样。他们说：“普及”的作品是低级的（有时说得客气些，则是通俗的）作品，是为了适应人民大众的低下的文化水平、专为达到宣传效果而写作的东西，因此，普及作品的思想性和艺术性不可能高。他们完全无视毛主席对于“普及”和“提高”问题的主要之点正是驳斥那些脱离群众、脱离现实、脱离政治而幻想着什么“藏之名山，传之后世”的资产阶级文人的观点；正是警告我们，不可以把“普及”和“提高”分成两橛，而应当辩证地来看待。文学史上的事实也证明，凡是人民所喜欢的作品，同时也是具有高度艺术性的作品。以为“普及”作品是低一级的这种看法，是侮辱人民大众的。毛主席的“普及”和“提高”的理论正是工农兵方向的一个主要构成部分。右派分子对于这个问题的歪曲，实质上就是企图取消工农兵方向。在政治标准和艺术标准问题上，他们的错误同样地严重。政治标准第一，艺术标准第二的提法，不应当解释为内容革命的作品可以缺少艺术性，而是指出，在我们评价作品时，首先要考虑的，是它的政治内容。换言之，即使作品的艺术性高，（技巧好），但内容不健康（更不用说反动的内容），我们就必须否定它（这是“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，说得很清楚的）。因此，政治标准第一、艺术标准第二的问题正也表现了阶级立场的问题。可是，右派分子偏偏要把毛主席早已指示得十分清楚的问题，加以歪曲，说什么两个标准不能分先后，而且牛头不对马嘴地用“文学作品的政治内容必须通过形象（艺术性）来表现”这句话来“证明”两个标准不可分开，硬说公式化、概念化的作品之所以产生其根源在于有这两个标准。右派分子在这个问题上，完全陷进了资产阶级的反动的“超阶级”的文艺思想的泥坑。
    右派分子还有一个“共同的语言”就是反对思想改造。文艺工作者的思想改造问题是加强马列主义的学习，参加斗争、生活在群众中、和群众共甘苦，加强艺术实践，这三方面长期的反复进行的过程。在文艺作品上，这就是世界观、生活经验和创作方法的互相影响的不可分割的关系。而其中作为主导的，是世界观。我们知识分子，文艺工作者在内，或多或少，或深或浅，都带着资产阶级思想，我们的世界观是复杂而矛盾的，有积极因素，也有消极因素，有进步方面，也有落后甚至反动的方面。有着这样的非工人阶级世界观的作家如果不先改造思想如何能够用社会主义思想来教育人民？世界观表现在我们以怎样的观点去看社会现实，站在什么立场上对待自己的工作（文艺实践）？社会主义现实主义就是针对这两个问题提出来的。我们要争取掌握社会主义现实主义，首先就要掌握马列主义的世界观，就要改造我们的思想。因此，强调什么“写真实”，而不提世界观对于“写真实”的指导作用，强调只要有生活经验而不提学习马列主义的必要，实质上是修正主义的思想，是违反了党的文艺路线的。右派分子甚至还公开地或半公开地说，马列主义世界观束缚了作家们自由发挥他的才能。这真是十足荒谬的邪说，而且完全歪曲了从高尔基到今天的苏联、人民民主国家和资本主义国家的革命文学家的艺术实践所提供的铁一般的事实！所有这些荒谬的言论，实质上都是取消了文艺工作者思想改造的必要性，是不要我们前进而要我们倒退。
    这些荒谬的言论，是有市场的。我们必须正视这一个事实。右派分子不要思想改造，认为马克思主义讲多了，就是教条主义。这是完全颠倒黑白的胡说！从文艺界来说，马克思主义不是讲得太多，而是讲得太少。反对教条主义和修正主义，反对自然主义和形式主义：这是党在文艺工作上所进行的两条战线的斗争。几年来我们没有很好地学习这一方针政策，没有根据这一方针政策来检查自己的思想和工作，没有很好地贯彻执行这一方针政策，这是文艺界所以会存在着大量右派分子、流行着右倾思想的原因，这也是丁、陈反党集团的荒谬言论和阴谋活动之所以能够骗取一部分文艺界同情的原因。丁陈反党集团的揭露和批判，是我们遵循党的方针政策在文艺界广泛地进行深刻的马列主义思想教育，帮助大家过社会主义关的一个开端。文艺思想上的批判和建设工作，对于文艺工作者的马列主义思想教育工作，今后必须加倍重视，而且要有个规划，有步骤地进行。对于这，我们大家都有责任。这次的反右派斗争使我们每个人获得教育。我们希望丁玲、冯雪峰、陈企霞和其他有反党言行的同志们在这次斗争中真能无情地解剖自己、洗心革面，从新做人；如果依然口是心非，希图蒙混过关，那就是最后毁灭了自己。
    扩大会议虽告结束，斗争还将继续深入。在全国范围内展开文艺上的社会主义道路和资产阶级道路的大辩论，弄清大是大非，这一任务是繁重的，所以还得我们大家加倍努力，在斗争的深入扩大中，克服资产阶级自由主义和个人主义，克服温情主义，坚决批判反党的文艺思想，无情地揭露反党的言行，借此教育自己，改造自己，过好社会主义这一关，在新的基础上加强文艺界的团结，发展社会主义的文艺。
