    Two Kinds of "Eyes" and "Mouths"
    Han Yi
    As reported, Xiao Qian once provided a "significant" answer to foreigners. The question was: Many foreign guests who have visited China "do not understand why the liberated Chinese are always smiling." The answer was: "The eyes of the Chinese are slanted upwards, and to match their eyes, the corners of their mouths are also often turned upwards, which becomes the so-called 'smile'." Judging from the fact that some foreign newspapers call this answer "significant," some people must be quite satisfied with it.
    However, I think these people have stayed in China for too short a time and seen too little. If they stayed longer and saw more, they would definitely find that "among the liberated Chinese" there is still a small group of people who are often frowning. If someone were to ask the question, "I do not understand why some of the liberated Chinese are full of sorrow," a Xiao-style answer should be, "Among the Chinese, there is a small group of people whose eyes are drooping downwards, and to match their eyes, the corners of their mouths are also often turned downwards; moreover, the ends of their eyebrows are also drooped, and the roots of their eyebrows are tightly furrowed. This becomes the so-called 'sorrowful look'." I have drafted this answer, but I don't know if it will be regarded as "important" by some people and be accepted with satisfaction. If so, I think it is still because they have stayed in China for too short a time and seen too little.
    If someone stayed longer and saw more, they would find that these people with drooping eyes and mouths suddenly had their eyes and mouths turned upwards in May of this year, but after June, they began to droop down again. Xiao Qian is also one of them. If someone asked: "I do not understand, why is this?" This probably cannot be answered only with "eyes" and "mouths."
    However, there are ready-made answers. A rightist in Tianjin, Li Peiying, replied: "Living in this society makes people very sad." "The eye is the seedling of the heart," so the upward or downward slant of the eyes is closely related to "happiness" and "sadness." I think Li Peiying's answer is much more important and much more honest than Xiao Qian's answer.

    两种“眼”和“嘴”
    汉一
    报载，萧乾曾向外国人提供过一个“重要”答案。问题是：许多访问过中国的外宾“不理解解放了的中国人为什么总是笑容满面”。答案是：“中国人的眼睛是朝两边向上吊起来的，为了配合眼睛，中国人的嘴角也就经常向上吊起来，这就成了所谓‘微笑’。”对这答案，从有些外国报纸把它称为“重要”来看，定是有人相当满意的了。
    但我以为，这种人在中国待的时间太短，看的也太少。如果住得久些，多看看，定会发现“在解放了的中国人中”还有一小撮人经常愁眉不展。倘有人要提出“我不理解在解放了的中国人中为什么有些人满面愁容”的问题，仿萧式的答案，应该是“在中国人中有一小部分人，眼睛是朝两边向下垂的，为了配合眼睛，他们的嘴角，也就经常向下垂起来；而且眉稍也就被连累得下垂，眉根儿也就紧蹙了。这就成了所谓的‘愁容’。”我代拟的这答案，不知可被一些人视为“重要”，满意地加以接受。倘有，我以为还是由于他在中国待的时间太短，看的太少。
    倘有人住得更久些，看得更多些，便会发现，原来这些眼角和嘴角下垂的人，突然在今年5月间眼角和嘴角都吊上去了，只是在6月以后，又开始垂下来。萧乾也就是这样的一个。倘有人提出：“我不理解，这为什么？”这恐怕就不能只用“眼睛”和“嘴”来作答案了。
    然而现成的答案却还有的。天津一个右派分子栗培英回答说：“生活在这个社会里叫人很伤心。”“眼是心之苗”，那末眼睛的上吊或下垂，同“开心”和“伤心”是大有关系的。我以为栗培英式的答案比萧乾式的答案，重要得多，也老实得多。
