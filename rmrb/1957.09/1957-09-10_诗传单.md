    Poetry Leaflet
    The Poisonous Mushroom
    Zhang Zhimin
    This filthy soul,
    Loves the dark places most,
    Uses poison as rouge,
    Uses bacteria as clothing…
    Sometimes it also wears a pretty skirt
    Trying to masquerade as a “flower”
    But it really isn't a flower,
    Because it can't stand the sun.
    The Rightist Returns Home
    Cao Yu
    The rightist returns home,
    Like drinking cold tea on a snowy day:
    His wife silently walks into the kitchen,
    His daughter pouts with puffed-up cheeks,
    His youngest son is only concerned with washing his red scarf,
    His eldest son stares at him with wide eyes,
    Only that little Pekingese dog
    Lazily wags its tail at him.

    诗传单
    毒菌
    张志民
    这个肮脏的灵魂，
    最喜欢阴暗的地方，
    用毒汁作胭脂，
    用细菌作衣裳……
    有时也穿件漂亮的裙子
    想冒充是一种“花”
    但它实在不是花，
    因为它见不得太阳。
    右派分子回到家
    草禹
    右派分子回到家，
    好似大雪天里吞凉茶：
    妻子默默地走进厨房
    女儿气鼓鼓地嘟着嘴巴
    小儿子只顾洗着红领巾
    大儿子瞪起眼睛看着他
    只有那只哈巴狗儿
    向他懒洋洋地摇了摇尾巴。
