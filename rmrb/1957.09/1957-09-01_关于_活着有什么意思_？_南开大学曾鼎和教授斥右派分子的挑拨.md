    Regarding “What's the Meaning of Living?”
    ——Professor Zeng Dinghe of Nankai University Rebukes the Right-Wingers' Provocation
    Chen Li
    Professor Zeng Dinghe, head of the Mathematics Department at Nankai University, delivered an interesting speech at a meeting of the Mathematics Department's anti-Rightist struggle, entitled "What's the Meaning of My Living?"
    As soon as he said the title, all the teachers in the department laughed – from the gray-haired old professors to the young female teaching assistants who had not graduated long ago. They laughed at the strange question; they laughed that a Rightist in the department (who used to be Professor Zeng's student) actually raised such a question, so that Professor Zeng had to answer this question which originally did not need to be answered.
    It turned out that this Rightist had made such a malicious provocation: "Professor Zeng has the title but no power, he is a puppet. The Party branch controls the department. I really don't understand what's the meaning of a puppet living."
    The reporter learned about this and decided to visit Professor Zeng.
    In a small and elegant study, the 48-year-old scholar was sitting on a rattan chair, studying at his desk. Seeing the reporter come in, he closed the book, cordially offered a seat, and the conversation started directly from "What's the Meaning of Living."
    "'What's the Meaning of Living?' In fact, this is not a question today. Asking this question reminds me of my life teaching at the university before liberation," Professor Zeng said. As he spoke, the reporter saw that although his complexion was ruddy, his temples were slightly gray, and the hard work of those years had etched many wrinkles in his deep-set eye sockets. "From 1942, I taught at Central University in Shapingba, Chongqing. I clearly remember a popular saying at that time: 'Professors, professors, the more you call them, the thinner they get.' At that time, there was a cartoon depicting the life of professors in Chongqing: a skinny professor, holding a child in one hand, fanning the stove with the other, but his eyes were on the book, and his wife was cooking next to him. This is a true portrayal of the life of professors at that time. At that time, I was indeed skinny..." At this time, I picked up a "family portrait" photo placed on the table and recognized the thin man sitting in the middle as Professor Zeng. Professor Zeng immediately explained that this photo was taken not long after liberation. Before liberation, he was much thinner than in this photo. To illustrate this point, he mentioned several old friends he hadn't seen for many years, who didn't dare to recognize him when they met him recently.
    "Later, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Central University moved to Nanjing," Professor Zeng continued, "Life did not improve, but deteriorated further. At that time, professors had to make a living by selling 'big heads' (silver dollars). Prices rose several times a day. If the monthly salary was not immediately exchanged for 'big heads,' it would vanish. Therefore, it was necessary to pay close attention to the market price of 'big heads' and buy and sell them in time, otherwise, it would be difficult to maintain life."
    Professor Zeng also used Du Fu's poem "Officials arrest people at night" to describe the atmosphere of terror in the university at that time. He said: "At that time, we dared not ask about national affairs. In the student dormitories, there were sometimes several scares a night, as Kuomintang secret agents were arresting people. In teahouses, restaurants, and bathhouses, there were signs saying 'Don't talk about state affairs.' At that time, I saw American military jeeps running rampant in the Shangqingsi area of Chongqing, and women dared not go out at night. I saw Chiang Kai-shek, this 'son emperor,' betraying the country and forfeiting its sovereignty, and I was very angry, but I lacked the courage to revolt. I really felt like 'there was no way to love the country!' In order to avoid losing my job and causing disputes, I also abided by the rule of 'not talking about state affairs.' The grand aspirations I had when studying abroad to conduct scientific research also subsided at this time. In addition to working hard for a living, in order to dispel the depression in my heart, I also pursued a life of 'leisurely years,' and listened to operas and sang Kunqu to pass the time when I was free. In such a situation, what's the meaning of living? It can be said that there was really no meaning."
    Professor Zeng paused and then went on to say: "After liberation, it was very different. I never thought that someone would ask me 'What's the Meaning of Living' today. Because I feel that only after liberation did I truly understand the meaning of life. The country has a future, and my work has a purpose; life is stable and busy. Busy as it is, I am always in a happy mood. I don't sing Kunqu anymore, because there are many more urgent things to do, but as long as I have leisure time in the future, I can continue to play." -- I saw a calendar with Chinese classical opera masks under the glass of his desk, which shows that Professor Zeng still maintains his hobby.
    Professor Zeng continued: "In the early days of liberation, to be honest, I was skeptical of the Communist Party, thinking that this was just another 'dynastic change.' Later, the Communist Party led the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. As soon as the volunteers went abroad, they won successive battles, which greatly surprised me. Since the Opium War, when has China ever won a war against a foreign country? But this time, it defeated the United Nations forces headed by the American aggressors. At this time, my sense of self-esteem for the motherland began to increase. Later, after ideological reform and teaching reform, my thinking underwent further changes. I realized that the Communist Party is selfless and pragmatic, says what it means and does what it says, so I changed from doubting the Communist Party to trusting it. I feel that with the leadership of the Communist Party, the country has a future. When I studied in France before, even children followed behind me and shouted Chin-Chin (a derogatory term for Chinese), and I also felt that China was really disappointing. Now, the Chinese people have finally stood up. Everyone is carrying out construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to catch up with advanced countries. Many things make people feel very excited. Looking at the situation in mathematics: the Mathematics Department of Tsinghua University only had 120 graduates in the 24 years from 1928 to 1952, but now Nankai University has more than 100 students in one class. How can this be compared? Before liberation, the vast majority of people teaching in universities did not do scientific research, but now they have started doing it; some old professors have not published articles for many years, but they have recently published articles again. From the perspective of Nankai University, there are five central research topics being carried out separately. For a scientist, the most pleasant thing is to be able to use his knowledge to serve the people. This is the new meaning of life. In contrast to the past decadence, I am now full of vigor." I knew that Professor Zeng was an expert in function theory. When I came in just now, I saw that he was reading two books on topology, so I asked in layman's terms: Is this related to Professor Zeng's scientific research? Professor Zeng said that his current scientific research topic is the classification and derivative of functions, and topology is needed when studying this problem.
    Professor Zeng finally said: "It can be seen that the sentence 'What's the Meaning of Living' is purely a malicious provocation by the Rightists. As the head of the department, of course I must work under the unified leadership of the Party and act in accordance with the Party's policies; if there is something, I must discuss it with the Party organization and with everyone, but if I need to make a decision, I will make a decision. Is this called 'having the title but no power'?" (At this time, I remembered what Professor Zeng said to that Rightist at a meeting: "What kind of power do you want the head of the department to have? Is it to decide everything personally? Then let me tell you, if the head of the department has such power, he can ask someone like you who opposes the head of the department to pack up and leave." Everyone laughed). "Now 600 million people are working together to build our country under the leadership of the Communist Party, completely changing the past situation of 'a sheet of loose sand,' but this is exactly what the Rightists don't like. If non-Party members are of one mind with the Party, act according to the Party's policies, and discuss things with the Party, they will say that you have the title but no power, call you a puppet, a wooden man, and say that you will not think independently; it seems that everyone is against the Party, so that we become 'a sheet of loose sand' again, which is called 'democracy.' I think this is a malicious distortion of democracy."

    关于“活着有什么意思”？
    ——南开大学曾鼎和教授斥右派分子的挑拨
    陈力
    南开大学数学系主任曾鼎和教授曾经在数学系反右派斗争的会议上发表了一段有趣的谈话，题目是“我活着有什么意思？”
    他一说出这个题目，全系的教师们都笑了——从须发斑白的老教授到毕业还不久的年青女助教。他们笑这个奇怪的问题；他们笑系里的一个右派分子（他以前是曾先生的学生）居然提出了这样的问题，以致曾先生不得不来回答这个本来并不需要回答的问题。
    原来是这样。这个右派分子曾经发出过这样的恶意挑拨：“曾先生有职无权，是傀儡。党支部把持着系。我真不了解傀儡活着有什么意思。”
    记者知道了这件事，就决定去访问曾先生。
    在小巧精雅的书室，这位四十八岁的学者正坐在藤椅上，伏案看书。看见记者进来，他阖上了书本，亲切地让坐，谈话就直截了当地从“活着有什么意思”开始了。
    “‘活着有什么意思？’其实这在今天是不成其为问题的。问起这个问题，使我回忆起解放前在大学教书的生活。”曾先生说这些话的时候，记者看见他的脸色虽然丰润，两鬓却已微微发白，当年的辛劳在他深陷的眼窝里刻下了许多皱纹。“从1942年起，我就在重庆沙坪坝中央大学教书。我清楚地记得那时候流行的一句话：‘教授、教授，越叫越瘦。’那时候有一幅描写重庆教授生活的漫画：一个骨瘦如柴的教授，一手抱着小孩，一手煽着炉子，眼睛却在看书，他的妻子在一旁炒菜做饭。这就是当时教授生活的写真。那时候，我也的确是骨瘦如柴……”这时候，我随手拿起摆在桌上的一帧“全家福”照片，认出了坐在中间的清癯的男子就是曾先生。曾先生马上解释说，这是解放后不久拍的照片，在解放前，他比在这张照片上照的还要瘦得多。为了说明这一点，他举出几位多年不见的老朋友，他们在最近同他见面的时候都不敢认他了。
    “后来抗战胜利，中央大学搬到南京，”曾先生接着说道，“生活不但没有改善，反而更加恶化了。那时候的教授要靠捣卖‘大头’（银元）为生。物价一日数涨，每月薪金发下来，如果不马上换成‘大头’，就会化为乌有。因此，必须密切注意‘大头’的行市，及时地买进卖出，否则，就难以维持生活。”
    曾先生还用杜甫的诗句“有吏夜捉人”来描述了当时大学里的恐怖气氛。他说：“那时候，我们不敢过问国家大事。学生宿舍里有时候一夜数惊，是国民党特务在抓人。在茶馆、饭馆、澡堂里都贴着‘莫谈国事’的纸条。我那时候眼看着重庆上清寺一带美国军用吉普横行、夜晚妇女不敢出门的情况，眼看着蒋介石这个儿皇帝丧权辱国，心里也是十分气愤，可是自己又缺乏革命的勇气，真有‘爱国无路’的感觉啊！为了免得打破饭碗和引起纠纷，自己也就遵守了‘不谈国事’的规定；从前在国外留学时还有进行科学研究的一番宏愿，这时候也都消沉下来。在为生活而奔波之余，为了排遣心中郁闷，也就追求‘悠悠岁月’的生活，空闲的时候就听听戏，唱唱昆曲来消磨时光。在这样的情况下，活着有什么意思呢？可以说：真是没有什么意思。”
    曾先生停顿了一下，又接下去说：“解放以后，可就大大不同了。我决没有想到今天居然会有人向我提出‘活着有什么意思’的问题。因为我自己感觉，可以说只是到解放以后才真正体会到生活的意义。国家有了前途，自己的工作也就有了目的；生活很安定，也很忙碌。忙是忙，心境却总是愉快的。昆曲是不唱了，因为有许多更急迫的事要去做，但是以后只要有了闲暇，要玩还是可以继续玩的。”——我从书桌的玻璃板下面看见一张画着中国古典戏剧脸谱的日历表，可见得曾先生还是保持着他的爱好呢。
    曾先生接着说：“我在解放初期，说实话，对于共产党是怀疑的，以为这也不过是又一次‘改朝换代’。后来，共产党领导了抗美援朝，志愿军一出国就接连打胜仗，这使自己大吃一惊。中国从鸦片战争以来，同外国打仗什么时候打胜过呢？可是这一次打败了以美国侵略者为首的十六国联军。这时候，我对祖国的自尊心开始增强起来了。以后，经过思想改造，教学改革，自己的思想有了进一步的变化，认识了共产党的大公无私、实事求是，说得出就做得到，于是对共产党由怀疑而变成信任。我感到有共产党的领导，国家就有前途。从前我在法国留学时，连小孩子也跟在后面喊Chin—Chin（中国佬，侮辱性的称谓），自己也感到中国实在太不争气；现在，中国人扬眉吐气了，大家都在中国共产党的领导下进行建设，要迎头赶上先进国家，许多事情，都使人感觉十分兴奋。从数学方面的情况来看：清华大学数学系从1928—1952的二十四年间，只有一百二十个毕业生，但是现在南开大学一班就有一百多人，这怎么能够相比呢？解放前绝大多数在大学教书的人都不做科学研究，但现在开始做了；有些老教授多年没有发表文章了，最近又有文章发表；从南开大学来说，就有五个中心研究题目在分头进行。对于一个科学工作者，最愉快的事情就是能用自己的知识为人民服务，这就是生活的新的意义，同过去的暮气沉沉相反，现在我是朝气勃勃了。”我知道曾先生是函数论方面的专家，刚才我进来的时候，又看见他正在看的是两本拓朴学的书，这时候我就用外行人的话来问：这和曾先生的科学研究是不是有关系？曾先生说，现在他的科学研究题目是函数的分类和导数，而在研究这个问题的时候，要用得到拓朴学的。
    曾先生最后说：“可见得，‘活着有什么意思’这句话纯粹是右派分子的恶意挑拨。我在系里担任系主任，当然要在党的统一领导下工作，要根据党的政策来办事；有了事，我要同党组织商量，也要同大家商量，但是该做决定的，我就做决定。这难道叫做‘有职无权’吗？”（这时候，我想起曾先生在一次会议上对那个右派分子说的话：“你要系主任有什么样的职权呢？是个人决定一切吗？那末我告诉你，如果系主任有了这样的权，那像你这样来反对系主任的，他是可以叫你卷铺盖的。”说得大家都笑了）。“现在是六亿人民在共产党领导下齐心来建设我们的国家，完全改变了过去‘一盘散沙’的状况，但这正是右派分子所不喜欢的。党外人士如果同党齐心，根据党的政策办事，有事同党商量，他们就说你有职无权，把你叫做傀儡、木头人，就说你不会独立思考；好像大家都同党闹对立，使我们重新成为‘一盘散沙’，这才叫做‘民主’似的。我认为，这是对民主的恶毒的歪曲。”
