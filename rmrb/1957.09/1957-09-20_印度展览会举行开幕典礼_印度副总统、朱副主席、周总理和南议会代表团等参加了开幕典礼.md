The gilded stupa base was decorated with the Indian national emblem, the arch of the central hall was adorned with four Indian kiosk-style circular gold roofs, and the arches embracing both sides were decorated with golden lotuses and patterns depicting various aspects of Indian economy and culture.

At the start of the ceremony, the band played the national anthems of China and India.
