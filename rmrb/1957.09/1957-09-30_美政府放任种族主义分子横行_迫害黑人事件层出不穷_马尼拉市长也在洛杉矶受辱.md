Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The U.S. government's indulgent attitude towards the Little Rock incident has emboldened American racists, as evidenced by several events that occurred in the United States on September 27th.

It is reported that savage racists in Albany (Georgia) burned down two houses of the state-run college that admitted black students. In Wilshire (West Virginia), four hundred middle school students, incited by racists, refused to attend classes with eight black children and held a demonstration on a main street in the city. The marchers carried banners that read: "We support Little Rock."

Prominent black lawyer Gray was arrested on the 27th in Montgomery (Alabama). He has defended white and black co-education in court more than once. Gray's entire "crime" was waiting for a plane in the "white" waiting room of the municipal airport.

The most typical incident occurred at the airport in Los Angeles. The mayor of Manila, Philippines, Arsenio Lacson, was subjected to racial discrimination and humiliation at this airport while traveling back from Mexico with his family. Lacson told reporters that representatives of the U.S. Public Health Service at the airport did not allow them to see immigration officials, saying that "American citizens should go first." Lacson said that this representative even ignored our diplomatic passports and called a dozen or so Americans to see the official first, then it was the Filipinos' turn. A "Pan American Airlines" executive "comforted" Lacson by saying, "Similar incidents can happen anywhere in the United States at any time."

These facts eloquently refute the U.S. propaganda machine's claim that racial hatred in the United States is only incited by "extremists" in a few southern states. These facts clearly show that racial discrimination in the United States is prevalent throughout the country and has, in fact, risen to the level of official policy.

    美政府放任种族主义分子横行
    迫害黑人事件层出不穷
    马尼拉市长也在洛杉矶受辱
    据新华社29日讯　美国政府对小石城事件所采取的纵容态度鼓舞了美国的种族主义分子，这一点从9月27日这一天美国所发生的一些事件特别可以得到确凿的说明。
    据报道，奥尔巴尼城（佐治亚州）野蛮的种族主义分子放火烧毁了接纳黑人学生的州立学院的两所房屋。威尔峙城（西弗吉尼亚州）有四百来个中学生在种族主义分子的煽动下拒绝同八个黑人儿童一起上课，并且在该城的一条主要街道上举行了示威游行。参加游行的人扛着横幅标语，上面写道：“我们支持小石城”。
    著名黑人律师格雷27日在蒙哥马利城（亚拉巴马州）被捕，他曾经不止一次地在法庭上为白人黑人合校辩护。格雷的全部“罪名”是他在市营航空站的“白人”候机室等飞机。
    最典型的事件是在洛杉矶的航空站上发生的。菲律宾的马尼拉市市长阿塞尼奥·拉克森携带家眷从墨西哥旅行回来的时候在这个航站上受到种族歧视的侮辱。拉克森对记者说，航空站的美国公共卫生机关的代表不许他们去见移民问题的官吏，说“美国公民应当先去”。拉克森说，这个代表甚至不理睬我们的外交护照，先叫十来个美国人去见这个官吏，然后轮到菲律宾人。“泛美航空公司”的负责人“安慰”拉克森说，“类似事件在美国随时随地都可能发生。”
    这些事实雄辩地驳倒了美国宣传机关所谓美国的种族仇视只是南方几个州的“极端分子”煽动起来的说法。这些事实明显地表明，美国的种族歧视遍及全国，实际上已经上升为官方政策。
