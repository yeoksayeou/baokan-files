    A Measure Saves Over Nine Million Feet of Cloth
    Ministry of Chemical Industry Decides to Improve Soda Ash Packaging Methods

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Ministry of Chemical Industry recently decided to change the soda ash packaging method, which can save a large amount of cotton cloth for the country every year.

    In the past, the soda ash produced by factories under the Ministry of Chemical Industry has always been packaged in two layers, that is, first wrapped in a layer of white cloth inside, and then covered with a layer of loosely woven burlap bag. This used to consume nearly 100,000 bolts of white cloth every year (calculated on the basis of three times of recycling, and the demand would be even greater if it is not recycled). In order to respond to the state's call for saving cotton cloth, the Yongli Dagukou Chemical Plant proposed the method of eliminating white cloth and changing loosely woven burlap bags to tightly woven burlap bags in April this year. After more than three months of trial use, the effect was good. Some shipments were transported thousands of miles from Tianjin to Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, and other places, and there were no phenomena such as alkali leakage or deterioration during the journey.

    The Ministry of Chemical Industry has now decided to fully promote this saving measure in the Dalian Alkali Plant and the Yongli Dagukou Chemical Plant. Based on the current production and transportation situation of these two factories, after all the tightly woven burlap bags are used, more than 9,844,400 *shi chi* of cotton cloth can be saved every year. Calculated on the basis of 16 *shi chi* of cloth per person per year, this amount of cloth is equivalent to the annual cloth consumption of 615,000 people.   (Jiang Zhenyuan)

    一项办法省布九百多万尺
    化工部决定改进纯碱包装方法
    本报讯  化学工业部最近决定改变纯碱包装办法，每年可以为国家节约大量棉布。
    过去化学工业部所属各厂生产的纯碱，一直是采用双层包装的办法，就是在里边先包一层白布，外边再套上一层稀织麻袋。这样每年要耗用白布近十万匹（以回收利用三次计算，如不回收利用，需要量更大）。为了响应国家节约棉布的号召，永利沽厂在今年4月间提出了取消白布、把稀织麻袋改为密织麻袋的办法。经过三个多月的试用，效果良好。有的从天津到湖南、云南、四川等地，运输数千里，也没有发生漏碱、途中变质等现象。
    化学工业部现在决定在大连碱厂、永利沽厂全面推广这一节约措施。按目前这两个厂的产运情况计算，全部改用密织麻袋以后，每年可以节约棉布九百八十四万四千多市尺。按每人每年用十六市尺布计算，这些布相当于六十一万五千人一年的用布量。    （江振远）
