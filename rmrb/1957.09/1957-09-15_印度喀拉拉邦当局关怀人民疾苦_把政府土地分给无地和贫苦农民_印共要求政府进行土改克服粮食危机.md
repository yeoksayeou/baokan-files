Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 14th: The Kerala government in India, led by the Communist Party, has issued an order to distribute government land to landless agricultural workers and poor farmers in rural areas for cultivation.

The government owns an estimated 700,000 acres of land, and each household can receive one acre of good land and three acres of dry land.

Land is extremely scarce in Kerala, with an average of only 0.3 acres of cultivated land per person.

Shortly after taking office in April this year, the Kerala government issued a decree prohibiting the recovery of tenants' land, ensuring that tenants would not be disturbed before the implementation of land reform.

It is reported that the Kerala government has drafted a comprehensive land reform bill and plans to submit it to the next state assembly meeting. The bill stipulates granting land ownership to cultivators, determining reasonable rents, and limiting the amount of private land to no more than fifteen acres.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 14th: In a memorandum to the government's Grain Investigation Committee, the Indian Communist Party called for land reform to overcome the current food crisis, which is hindering the completion of the Second Plan.

The Indian Communist Party's proposals include abolishing the landlord system, distributing arable wasteland to agricultural laborers and poor farmers, with the state helping them with reclamation, and completing land reform with the active cooperation of democratically elected farmer and agricultural laborer committees.

The memorandum also suggested that the government assist poor and middle peasants, invest in agriculture, and provide cheaper and better irrigation equipment.

The memorandum stated that eight out of the fourteen states in India are currently short of food, and grain prices are soaring. The main reason for this food crisis is "the agricultural crisis left over from British rule" and the failure to reorganize the agricultural economy based on the slogan "land to the tiller."

　　印共要求政府进行土改克服粮食危机
    据新华社新德里14日电  印度共产党所领导的喀拉拉邦政府已经颁布命令，把政府的土地给农村中无地的农业工人和贫苦农户耕种。
    政府所有的土地估计约七十万英亩，每户可以分得一英亩好地和三英亩旱地。
    喀拉拉邦土地非常缺乏，耕地面积按人口计算，每人平均只有○点三英亩。
    喀拉拉邦政府在今年4月就职以后不久就颁布了一项禁止收回佃户土地的法令，使佃户们在土地改革实施以前不致受到干扰。
    据报道，喀拉拉邦政府已经起草了一项全面的土地改革法案，准备在下次邦议会会议上提出。这项法案规定赋予耕种者以土地所有权，确定合理的地租，并且规定私有土地数量不得超过十五英亩。
    据新华社新德里14日电  印度共产党在一项给政府的谷物调查委员会的备忘录中，要求进行土地改革，以克服现在面临的粮食危机，这种危机妨碍第二个计划的完成。
    印度共产党的建议包括废除地主制度、分配可耕荒地给农业劳动者和贫农，而由国家帮助他们进行开垦，以及在民主选举出来的农民和农业劳动者委员会的积极合作下完成土地改革。
    备忘录还建议政府帮助贫农和中农，在农业方面投资，提供更便宜和更良好的灌溉设备。
    备忘录说，印度十四个邦中今天有八个邦缺粮，粮价高涨。造成这种粮食危机的主要原因是“英国统治时代所遗留下来的农业危机”，和没有根据耕者有其田的口号改组农业经济。
