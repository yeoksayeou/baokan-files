Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 25th: Students in approximately thirty cities across Japan, including Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, and Sapporo, are holding rallies, conducting signature campaigns, and posting leaflets to demand the release of patriotic workers and students arrested by the government.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department arrested twenty-three patriotic workers and students on the 22nd, accusing them of supporting the residents of Sunagawa Town in their struggle against the US expansion of the Tachikawa Air Base, claiming it "violated" the "Special Criminal Law." On the 24th, the police department arrested two trade union workers on the same "grounds."

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with over three million members, decided today to hold demonstrations in front of the Prime Minister's official residence, the Metropolitan Police Department, the Prosecutor's Office, and other relevant government agencies, demanding the release of the arrested patriots. The General Council also decided to hire twenty-three lawyers to defend the arrested individuals.
