The national planning conference for drafting the 1958 national economic plan has concluded. Currently, central departments and provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional authorities are drafting the 1958 national economic plan based on the planned control figures (draft) determined at this conference.

What issues should be considered when drafting the 1958 national economic plan?

1958 is the first year of China's Second Five-Year Plan. The 1958 national economic plan should be a good start to the Second Five-Year Plan. The drafting of the 1958 national economic plan must be based on Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the relevant guidelines and policies formulated by the Party and the government according to China's specific conditions, the experience gained in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, and the principles of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China regarding the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) for the development of the national economy, arranging all planned targets in a manner that is both active and reliable, so as to correctly solve some of the new and prominent problems that have emerged in China's economic development during the Second Five-Year Plan.

What are the prominent problems currently existing in China's economic development, particularly between various sectors? The main issue is that the development of agricultural production still lags behind the needs of other sectors of the national economy, especially industrial development, and the improvement of people's consumption levels is inevitably subject to certain restrictions. Correctly resolving this issue is the primary task of drafting the 1958 national economic plan.

The guiding principle for drafting the 1958 plan is: while affirming the focus on developing heavy industry, simultaneously implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture in tandem, increase investment in the development of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy projects, and increase investment in industrial sectors that can promote agricultural production, in order to accelerate agricultural development; actively develop raw materials and fuel industries, especially developing certain special varieties and raw materials in short supply, as well as the coal industry; continue to implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises and fully utilizing small industries and handicrafts; pay attention to ensuring that the development of transportation, especially railway transportation, adapts to the needs of industrial and agricultural capital construction and production development; strengthen the regulatory role of foreign trade on domestic production and markets; improvements in people's living standards and the development of cultural, educational, and health undertakings must be commensurate with the level of economic development; the total wages of workers and staff should increase to a certain extent with the increase in the number of workers and staff, provided that wage standards remain unchanged; the purchasing power of farmers should also increase to a certain extent on the basis of increased production; cultural, educational, and health undertakings should develop steadily on the basis of improving quality. At the same time, the campaign to increase production and practice economy should be continued, military and administrative expenses and enterprise and institutional management expenses should continue to be reduced, investment in non-productive construction should be reduced, and the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift should be further implemented.

Now, we will focus on discussing the three issues of developing agriculture, developing industry, and building the country through diligence and thrift for the reference of all units in drafting the 1958 national economic plan.

Regarding the development of agriculture. In the control figures for the 1958 agricultural production plan, the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations is planned to increase by 4.8% compared to the previous year, slightly higher than the average annual growth rate of 4.5% projected during the First Five-Year Plan; the total grain output is planned to exceed the previous year; while the cotton output is still lower than the 1957 target set in the First Five-Year Plan. Judging from the preliminary arrangements for the production targets of major agricultural crops in 1958, the supply of grain and cotton in 1959 will still not keep up with the needs of the gradual improvement of people's lives and industrial development, and the supply of most other agricultural raw materials for industrial use will also remain tight. Therefore, how to implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, while affirming the focus on developing heavy industry, and to do everything possible to strengthen agricultural construction and promote agricultural development, is an important task in drafting the 1958 national economic plan and a problem that must be continuously studied and resolved in the future.

The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967 already contains comprehensive and detailed provisions for the issue of developing agricultural production, which must continue to be implemented. Here, we will mainly discuss how to correctly solve the problem of investment in agricultural development and the rational use of investment, as well as the ratio of cash crops to grain crops, on the basis of further improving agricultural production cooperatives.

To develop agriculture, it is necessary to consider the state's investment in basic construction related to agricultural development, agricultural loans, agricultural operating expenses, and the agricultural production cooperatives' own investment in a unified manner, implement unified planning, and make appropriate arrangements in order to better exert the effect of investment. It must be pointed out that the state's investment in agricultural development has been considerable in recent years, and will increase year by year in the future; the state's operating expenses in agriculture are also considerable, part of which can be saved, and part of which can be converted for agricultural production investment; the investment of agricultural production cooperatives themselves is also constantly increasing on the basis of production development and the gradual improvement of the lives of members. How to use this fund properly is also an issue that needs to be carefully studied.

The use of agricultural investment mainly includes three aspects: water conservancy construction (including flood control, drainage, irrigation, and soil and water conservation), the development of the fertilizer industry, and land reclamation.

In terms of water conservancy construction, emphasis should be placed on medium and small-scale water conservancy construction, such as digging wells, building canals, repairing ponds, and drainage, which play a significant role in expanding irrigation area, reducing water damage, and promoting agricultural production increase. As for the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects, because they involve a wide range of issues, they must be approached with great caution. Construction must be carried out after surveying and design, unified planning, so as to achieve comprehensive utilization and benefit both upstream and downstream areas; and must be carried out after full research and repeated discussions. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, an average of about 50 to 100 million mu of low-lying land is flooded every year, resulting in a reduction of 10 to 20 billion jin of grain every year. If the drainage problem in this area is solved, this regular disaster in the heartland of China can be eliminated, and 10 to 20 billion jin of grain can be ensured every year, and the better development of local cash crops can be promoted. Therefore, spending a certain amount of investment in this area to generally complete this work in about ten years is of great political and economic significance.

In terms of developing the fertilizer industry, factories producing different types of fertilizers should be built separately to meet the needs of local soil and crops. The construction of large, medium, and small fertilizer factories should be combined, with the main emphasis on the construction of medium and small factories, and national unified planning and rational distribution should be carried out on the basis of existing facilities. In the long run, the development of the fertilizer industry is an extremely important condition for increasing agricultural production. However, for a considerable period of time, farm manure will still be the main source of fertilizer in China's agriculture. The work in both of these aspects must be further strengthened, and a mass movement of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation should be launched this winter and next spring to ensure increased agricultural production.

In terms of land reclamation, priority should be given to areas with fertile soil, high yields, convenient transportation, and proximity to industrial bases. This will not only maximize the economic effect of investment and make land reclamation easier, but also facilitate the combination of industrial development with agricultural development.

In addition, improving farming techniques also plays an important role in developing agricultural production, and effective measures and specific steps must be taken to promote those effective technical measures.

Regarding the ratio of grain crops to cotton planting area, the most prominent contradiction at present is that the cotton planting area is gradually shrinking. Of course, grain production must be increased, but if a certain amount of cotton planting area is not maintained, it will not be possible to guarantee the production of the necessary amount of cotton cloth. To solve this problem, first of all, the ratio of grain crops to cotton planting area should be reasonably stipulated nationwide according to the different areas suitable for grain and cotton. From the current situation, it is more appropriate to maintain the cotton planting area at the level of 90 million mu. In the future, an appropriate amount of arable land should also be allocated to plant cotton in the newly expanded arable land area. At the same time, in the existing cotton fields, the planting area of high-yield cotton fields should be reduced as little as possible.

In addition, there is a situation of farmland abandonment in the mountainous areas of some provinces, which should be corrected by taking effective measures. The farmland in mountainous and hilly areas of China accounts for one-half of the country's farmland. Actively developing mountainous areas is of great significance to the development of China's agriculture. It is necessary to strengthen soil and water conservation and animal husbandry and afforestation in mountainous areas, and gradually improve transportation conditions in mountainous areas to promote the economic prosperity of mountainous areas.

Regarding the development of industry. The 1958 national economic plan control figures stipulate that the total industrial output value will increase by 8% to 10% compared with the previous year. In terms of the development of industrial production, in addition to putting the development of the chemical fertilizer industry in an important position to meet the needs of agricultural production as mentioned above, in order to meet the needs of industrial production, basic construction, and the market, the production of fuel and certain particularly scarce raw material industries should be actively developed. That is to say, it is necessary to vigorously develop chemical fertilizers and coal to promote agricultural development; develop ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, petroleum, salt, and alkali to meet the needs of the development of the manufacturing industry, transportation machinery industry, and chemical industry. In the development of the ferrous metal industry, special attention should be paid to increasing urgently needed varieties. In the development of the non-ferrous metal industry, more attention should be paid to the development of copper production. At the same time, the proportion of mineral product exports should be appropriately and gradually increased, and the proportion of agricultural product exports should be reduced.

In the mining industry, in addition to building some large-scale modern enterprises as raw material bases according to resource conditions and industrial distribution needs, it is also necessary to build more medium and small-scale enterprises and enterprises that use manual mining, and combine the development of the two. In the development of medium and small-scale raw material industries, the initiative of local governments, handicraft production cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives should be fully utilized. It is possible to advocate that provinces, special zones, and counties run raw material industrial enterprises, and it is also possible to advocate that relevant handicraft production cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives (as sideline occupations) open small coal mines, small iron mines, small non-ferrous metal mines, small non-metal mines, and small alkali fields. Only in this way can the conditions of China's abundant human resources be appropriately brought into play, China's rich resources can be developed, social employment can be expanded, farmers' income can be increased, and export goods can be increased. In this regard, it is necessary to have a mass perspective and follow the mass line. It is impossible for the relevant industrial departments of the central government to solve this serious task alone. Of course, in doing so, it is necessary to take into account resource conditions, design, equipment manufacturing, metal material supply, and investment possibilities, and make reasonable arrangements with foresight and hindsight, and not to proceed blindly without regard to objective conditions. At the same time, attention should be paid to not destroying national resources, to safe production, to the specifications and technical requirements of products, and to giving play to the initiative of the masses. Therefore, the relevant departments of the central government and local governments should strengthen leadership, unify planning, and provide active support in terms of funds, technology, and price policies.

In terms of the production of the machinery industry, due to the relatively tight supply of several raw materials and the need for mechanical equipment in basic construction is not growing much, while the existing production capacity of the machinery industry is relatively large, therefore, the production capacity of the machinery industry in various departments and regions of the country must be unified. For products needed by society, production should be actively increased to maximize the self-sufficiency rate of mechanical equipment. At the same time, efforts should be made to trial-produce and produce new types of products, so as to strive to have most of the mechanical equipment needed for domestic construction during the Second Five-Year Plan solved domestically. For this reason, a unified arrangement must be made for the enterprises managed by various machinery departments, the machinery industrial enterprises managed by non-machinery departments and localities. This is an important issue in the current development of machinery industrial production. The principle of arrangement should be: combining defense industry and civilian industry; combining specialization and collaboration; combining manufacturing and repair. The investment in basic construction of the machinery industry is slightly reduced in the 1958 plan compared to 1957. This investment is mainly used to develop heavy and precision machinery industry.

In terms of the production of light industry, the main issue is the arrangement of cotton textile industry production. Due to the reduction of cotton planting area in 1957 compared with the previous year, the production and supply of cotton is limited to a certain extent. Therefore, the production of yarn and cloth in 1958 can only maintain the level of 1957, which will cause certain difficulties in the production and market arrangement of yarn and cloth in 1958. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the socialist education of farmers, earnestly do a good job in purchasing cotton, and increase the purchase volume in order to increase the production of yarn and cloth. At the same time, the existing various fiber raw materials in the country (such as cotton linters, cotton stalk skin, wild hemp, mulberry silk, tussah silk, castor silk, etc.) should be fully utilized, do not dislike it is less, do not dislike trouble, to achieve how much can be used. In addition, proper arrangements should also be made for the production of old and new cotton textile mills and the production of handmade weaving industry.

Continuing to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and continuing to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift is the key to drafting the 1958 national economic plan. First of all, we must strive to increase production. Every factory and mine, every agricultural production cooperative and handicraft production cooperative must overcome negative factors, carry forward positive factors, strengthen production leadership, tap potential strength, and strive to improve production indicators and ensure that they exceed the planned control figures through the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle. In particular, specific measures must be taken from all aspects to ensure the realization of increased production of grain, cotton, and industrial raw materials. Secondly, in terms of basic construction, all departments should strictly implement the party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and various specific policies when drafting plans, so that the development of China's construction undertakings is closely integrated with China's existing economic level, so that the construction of large enterprises is combined with the construction of medium and small enterprises, so that general technology is combined with the latest technology, so that mechanization is combined with manual operation, try to use as much domestically manufactured equipment as possible, try to organize cooperation between enterprises, avoid duplicate construction of auxiliary workshops and repair factories, and reduce secondary projects and unnecessary equipment, reduce design standards and quotas, resolutely stop the construction of certain non-essential non-productive construction projects, resolutely save construction land, resolutely stop various waste phenomena, and strive to save 3% to 5% of investment in local plans within the planned investment control figures, and 5% to 10% of central departments, in order to do more things with the same amount of investment. Thirdly, in all economic departments, efforts should be made to improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and accelerate capital turnover in order to save more funds for the country. Finally, all military and administrative organs, cultural and educational departments, and people's organizations should further practice economy, reduce military and administrative expenses, reduce the expenditure of operating expenses, and reduce office expenses, so that one person can do the work of several people, and one yuan can do the work of several yuan. A plan compiled in this spirit will surely promote the further upsurge of China's national economy in 1958 and create a good start for the Second Five-Year Plan.

    编好一九五八年度国民经济计划
    为编制1958年度国民经济计划的全国计划会议已经结束，目前中央各部门和各省市自治区正在根据这次会议所确定的计划控制数字（草案），编制1958年度的国民经济计划。
    在编制1958年度国民经济计划的时候，应该注意一些什么问题呢？
    1958年是我国第二个五年计划的第一年。1958年度的国民经济计划应该成为第二个五年计划的一个良好开端。1958年度的国民经济计划的编制，必须根据毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的报告，根据党和政府按照我国具体情况所确定的有关的方针政策，根据第一个五年计划执行过程中的经验和党的第八次全国代表大会关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划（1958年到1962年）的建议的原则，既积极又可靠地安排各项计划指标，以便于在第二个五年计划期间，正确地解决我国经济发展中所出现的一些新的突出的问题。
    在我国经济发展中，在各部门相互之间，当前所存在的突出的问题是什么呢？主要的就是农业生产的发展，还落后于国民经济的其他部门，特别是工业发展的需要；人民消费水平的提高，不能不受到一定的限制。正确地解决这一问题，是编制1958年国民经济计划的主要任务。
    编制1958年度计划的方针是：在肯定以发展重工业为中心的前提下，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，增加对于发展农林水利事业的投资，增加能够促进农业增产的工业部门的投资，以加紧农业的发展；积极地发展原材料工业和燃料工业，特别是发展某些特殊的品种和供应不足的原材料以及煤炭工业；继续贯彻执行大、中、小型企业相结合和充分利用小工业、手工业的政策；注意使交通运输业特别是铁路运输业的发展适应于工农业的基本建设和生产发展的需要；加强对外贸易对于国内生产和市场的调剂作用；人民生活的改善和文教卫生事业的发展，必须同经济的发展水平相适应，职工的工资总额，在工资标准不变动的条件下，随着职工人数的增加有一定的增加；农民的购买力在增产的基础上，也有一定的增长；文化、教育、卫生事业应该在提高质量的基础上稳步地发展。同时，应继续开展增产节约运动，继续节减军政费用和企业、事业管理费用，努力降低非生产性建设的投资，进一步贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针。
    现在，我们着重地谈一谈发展农业、发展工业和勤俭建国三个问题，供各单位编制1958年度国民经济计划草案的参考。
    关于发展农业的问题。在1958年度农业生产计划的控制数字中，农业和农副业总产值计划比上年度增长4.8％，略高于第一个五年计划期间预计平均每年增长4.5％的速度；粮食总产量计划将超过上一年度；棉花的产量则还低于第一个五年计划所规定的1957年指标。从现在初步安排的1958年主要农作物的生产指标来看，1959年粮食和棉花的供应仍然赶不上人民生活逐步改善和工业发展的需要，其他大多数工业用的农业原料的供应也仍然是紧张的。因此，在以发展重工业为中心的前提下，如何贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，想尽一切办法，加强对农业的建设，促进农业的发展，这是编制1958年度国民经济计划的重要任务，也是今后必须继续加以研究解决的问题。
    对于发展农业生产的问题，在1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）中，已有全面详尽的规定，必须继续贯彻执行。这里主要地谈一谈在进一步办好农业生产合作社的基础上，如何正确地解决发展农业的投资和合理地运用投资的问题，以及技术作物同粮食作物种植的比例的问题。
    要发展农业，必须把国家对于有关发展农业的基本建设投资、农业贷款、农业事业费开支和农业生产合作社本身的投资结合起来考虑，实行统一规划，适当安排，才能更好地发挥投资的效果。必须指出：几年来国家对于发展农业的投资是相当大的，而且今后将逐年有所增长；国家用在农业方面的事业费也是相当大的，其中有一部分是可以节省的，有一部分是可以改用于农业生产投资的；农业生产合作社本身的投资，在生产发展、社员生活逐步改善的基础上，也在不断地增加。如何使这笔资金用得妥当，也是需要很好地研究的问题。
    农业投资的用途，主要有兴修水利（包括防洪、排涝、灌溉和水土保持在内）、发展肥料工业、开垦荒地三个方面。
    在兴修水利方面，应该着重中、小型水利建设，打井、修渠、修塘、排涝等等，这对于扩大灌溉面积，减少水害，促进农业增产有很大的作用。至于大型水利工程的兴建，因为牵涉问题很广，要十分慎重。必须经过勘测设计，统一规划，以求做到综合利用，上下游都能得利；并且要经过充分研究、反复讨论决定以后，才能进行建设。同时，还应该指出，目前在冀、鲁、豫、皖、苏五省，每年平均约有五千万到一亿亩的低洼地遭受涝灾，每年减产达一百到二百亿斤粮食。如果解决了这个地区的排涝问题，就可以免除我国腹心地区的这一经常性的灾害，每年保产一百到二百亿斤粮食，并且推动当地经济作物更好地发展。因此，在这方面花一定的投资，在十年左右的时间内大体上做好这一工作，在政治上和经济上都有重大的意义。
    在发展肥料工业方面，应该适应各地土壤和农作物的需要，分别建设生产不同种类肥料的工厂。应该把大型的和中、小型的肥料工厂的建设相结合，主要建设中、小型的工厂，在已有的基础上，全国统筹规划，合理分布。从长远来说，发展肥料工业是农业增产的一个极重要的条件。但是在相当长的时期以内，农家积肥仍然是我国农业肥料的主要来源。必须进一步加强以上两方面的工作，在今冬明春开展一个群众性的兴修水利和积肥运动，以保证农业增产。
    在开垦荒地方面，应该首先把重点放在土壤肥沃、收获量高以及交通方便、接近工业基地的地区，这样不仅投资的经济效果要大，垦荒工作容易进行，而且便于把工业的发展同农业的发展结合起来。
    此外，改良耕作技术，对于发展农业生产也有重要的作用，必须采取妥善办法和具体步骤，推广那些行之有效的技术措施。
    在粮食作物同棉花种植面积的比例方面，当前最突出的矛盾，是棉花的种植面积逐渐在缩小。当然，粮食是必须增产的，但是，如果不保持一定数量的棉花的种植面积，则生产必要数量的棉布，就不能保证。要解决这个问题，首先要在全国范围内，根据宜粮宜棉的不同地区，合理地规定粮食作物同棉花种植面积的比例关系。从目前的情况来看，棉花的种植面积以保持在九千万亩的水平上是比较适宜的。今后，在新扩大的耕地面积中，也应该分配适当数量的耕地种植棉花。同时，在现有的棉田中，应该尽量不减少高产区棉田的种植面积。
    此外，有些省份的山区耕地有荒废情况，亟应采取有效措施，加以纠正。我国山区和丘陵区耕地，占全国耕地的二分之一，积极建设山区，对我国农业的发展有极大的意义。必须加强山区的水土保持和畜牧、造林工作，逐步地改善山区的交通条件，来繁荣山区的经济。
    关于发展工业的问题。1958年度国民经济计划控制数字拟定：工业总产值将比上年增长8％到10％，在工业生产的发展方面，除了如上面所说的应该把化学肥料工业的发展放到重要的地位上来，以适应农业生产的发展需要以外，为了适应工业生产、基本建设和市场的需要，应该积极发展燃料和某些特别缺乏的原材料工业的生产。这就是说，必须大力发展化肥、煤炭，以促进农业的发展；发展黑色金属、有色金属、石油、盐、碱，以满足制造工业、运输机械工业、化学工业发展的需要。在黑色金属工业的发展上，应该特别注意增加急需的品种。在有色金属工业的发展上，应该更多地注意发展铜的生产。同时要适当地逐步增加矿产品的出口比重，减少农产品的出口比重。
    在采掘工业方面，除了根据资源条件和工业分布的需要，必须建设一些大型的近代化的企业作为原料基地之外，还必须建设更多的中、小型的和用手工开采的企业，并且将两者的发展结合起来。在发展中、小型原材料工业方面，要充分地发挥地方政府、手工业生产合作社和农业生产合作社的积极性。可以提倡省、专区和县举办原材料工业企业，也可以提倡有关的手工业生产合作社、农业生产合作社（作为副业）来开小煤矿、小铁矿、小有色金属矿、小非金属矿、小碱场等等。只有这样，才能适当地发挥我国人力充足的条件，开发我国丰富的资源。并且扩大社会就业，增加农民的收入，增加出口物资。在这方面，必须有群众观点和走群众路线，只靠中央有关的工业部门是无法解决这一严重的任务的。当然，在这样做的时候，必须根据资源情况，设计、设备制造、金属材料供应的情况，以及投资的可能性等等，统筹兼顾，瞻前顾后地合理安排，而不能不顾客观条件，盲目地进行。同时，还要注意不破坏国家资源，要注意安全生产，要注意产品的规格和技术要求，要注意发挥群众的积极性。因此，中央有关部门和地方政府，应该加强领导，统一规划，并且从资金、技术、价格政策等方面给以积极的支持。
    在机械工业的生产方面，由于若干种原材料的供应比较紧张和基本建设对机械设备的需要量增长不多，而机械工业现有的生产能力较大，因此，对于全国各部门、各地方机械工业的生产能力，必须加以统一安排。凡是社会上需要的产品，应该积极增产，尽量提高机械设备的自给率。同时应该努力进行新种类产品的试制和生产，以争取在第二个五年计划期间国内建设所需要的机械设备的绝大部分由国内解决。为此就要对于各机械部门所管的企业、非机械部门和地方所管的机械工业企业，进行统筹安排。这是当前发展机械工业生产的一个重要问题。安排的原则，应该是：国防工业和民用工业相结合；专业化和协作相结合；制造和修理相结合。对于机械工业的基本建设投资，1958年计划比1957年略有减少，这种投资，主要用来发展重型的和精密的机械工业。
    在轻工业的生产方面，主要是对于棉纺织工业生产的安排问题。由于1957年棉花的播种面积比上年有所减少，棉花的生产和供应受到一定的限制，因此，1958年纱布的生产大体上只能维持1957年的水平，这对于1958年纱布的生产和市场安排都将发生一定的困难。所以必须加强对农民的社会主义教育，认真做好收购棉花的工作，增加收购量，以增产纱布。同时，对于国内现有的各种纤维原料（如棉子绒、棉秆皮、野麻、家蚕丝、柞蚕丝、蓖麻蚕丝等），应该充分地加以利用，不要嫌少，不要嫌麻烦，要做到有多少能利用多少。此外，对于棉纺织业的老厂、新厂以及手工织布业的生产，也应该作妥善的安排。
    继续开展增产节约运动，继续贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，这是编好1958年度国民经济计划的关键。首先，必须努力增产，各个工厂和矿山，各个农业生产合作社和手工业生产合作社，都要通过整风运动和反右派斗争，克服消极因素，发扬积极因素，加强生产领导，挖掘潜在力量，努力提高生产指标，保证超过计划控制数字。特别是对于粮食、棉花和工业原材料的增产，必须从各方面采取具体措施，保证实现。其次，在基本建设方面，各部门在编制计划的时候，应该严格执行党的勤俭建国的方针和各项具体政策，使我国建设事业的发展同我国现有的经济水平密切地结合起来，使大型企业的建设同中、小型企业的建设结合起来，使一般技术同最新技术结合起来，机械化同手工操作结合起来，尽量多用本国自己制造的设备，尽量组织企业之间的协作，避免重复建设辅助车间和修理工厂。并且削减次要工程和不必要的设备，降低设计标准和定额，坚决停建某些非必需的非生产性建设项目，坚决节约建设用地，坚决制止各种浪费现象，力争在投资计划控制数字以内，地方节约投资3％至5％，中央部门节约5％至10％，以便拿同样数量的投资办更多的事情。再次，在各经济部门，都要努力提高劳动生产率、降低成本、加速资金周转，以便为国家节约更多的资金。最后，一切军政机关、文教部门、人民团体都要进一步厉行节约，节减军政费用，节减事业费的开支，节减办公费用，以一个人办几个人的事情，以一元钱办几元钱的事情。按照这样的精神编制出来的计划，必然能够促进1958年度我国国民经济的进一步地高涨，并且为第二个五年计划创立一个良好的开端。
