According to a person in charge of the Vietnamese Ministry of Education, there are currently 1,971 Vietnamese students studying in fraternal countries, with the most in the Soviet Union and China. They are studying dozens of different majors ranging from metallurgy to machinery, from geology to meteorology, from architecture to water conservancy, from philosophy to history, and even shipbuilding, papermaking, music, and dance… Because of their diligence and hard work in their studies, their grades are generally excellent. The vast majority of Vietnamese students in the Soviet Union have overall scores of five or four, and many students in China have been awarded "Three Good" student awards. Recently, Huang Youping, a student studying chemistry at the Dresden Institute in Germany, received the top grade in the class's annual examination; Xie Mengben (15 years old), a young man studying violin at the Tianjin Central Conservatory of Music's Affiliated Middle School, was also welcomed by the audience during his first performance in Beijing.

All of the early Vietnamese students who completed their studies and returned to their country were assigned to work in government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, and schools, adhering to the principle of combining learning with application. They are actively contributing their strength to the cause of their motherland's recovery and construction.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Education said: Vietnam will not send a large number of students abroad this year; only three graduate students will go to the Soviet Union to study atomic energy soon. In addition, a small number of people will go to Eastern European fraternal countries to study literature and art courses, including the young singers Guo Xiang and Chen Shu, who are known for singing Vietnamese classical and folk songs, and they will study singing with Hungarian vocal experts. The main reason for adopting this decision is that the Vietnamese Ministry of Education will open the first preparatory class for students studying abroad in the second half of this year, and conduct one year of foreign language and political training for students preparing to be sent abroad. At the same time, the Ministry of Education will also make some adjustments to the number of students and their majors based on the country's economic development plan. In the past, most of the students sent by Vietnam studied engineering and technology, and very few majored in basic sciences. In the future, in addition to appropriately strengthening the latter, more people will study social sciences, literature, and journalism.

    越南留学生在兄弟国家
    据越南教育部负责人谈，目前越南有一千九百七十一名留学生在各兄弟国家学习，其中以苏联和中国为最多。他们学习着从冶金到机械、从地质到气象、从建筑到水利、从哲学到历史，以至造船、造纸、音乐、舞蹈……等几十种不同的专业。由于学习上勤劳、刻苦，成绩普遍优良。在苏联的越南留学生总成绩绝大多数是五分或四分，许多在中国的留学生被奖为“三好”学生。最近，在德国德累斯顿学院学化学的黄有平，获得了全班学年考试成绩的头一名；在天津中央音乐学院附属中学学提琴的少年谢猛奔（十五岁），也在首次访问北京的演出当中，受到听众的欢迎。
    越南早期派出的留学生学成回国以后，全部在照顾学用一致的原则下被分配到政府机关、工矿企业和学校的岗位上工作。他们正在祖国恢复和建设的事业中，积极地贡献出自己的力量。
    教育部负责人说：越南今年将不大批派遣留学生出国，只有三名研究生将于最近去苏联学习原子能。此外，还有少数人到东欧兄弟国家进修文学和艺术方面的课程，其中包括以演唱越南古典和民间歌曲著称的青年歌手郭乡、陈树，他们将跟匈牙利的声乐专家学唱。采取这样决定的主要原因，是越南教育部将在今年下半年开办第一届留学生预备班，对准备派出的学生进行一年外国语文和政治的训练。同时，教育部还将就国家发展经济的计划，对留学生的人数和专业等作些调整。越南过去派出的学生大多学习工程、技术，很少人主修基础科学，今后除了适当加强后者，还要有更多的人学习社会科学、文学和新闻。
