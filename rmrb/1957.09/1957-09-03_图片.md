    The domestically produced "Liberation" brand trucks, fully loaded with goods from the interior and speeding across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, are no longer rare sights to the mountain goats. The once easily startled and curious sheep are now accustomed to the rumbling of the engines. As the trucks arrive, they don't even bother to lift their heads, busily gnawing at their lush aquatic plants. Photo by Ma Minxin (Xinhua News Agency manuscript)
