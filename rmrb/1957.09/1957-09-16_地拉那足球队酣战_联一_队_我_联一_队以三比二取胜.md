　　Tirana Football Team Battles "United First" Team
　　Our "United First" Team Wins 3-2
　　(Our Newspaper’s Report) Yesterday afternoon, the Albanian Tirana football team played a friendly match against our country’s “United First” team at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium. This was the last friendly match of their visit to our country. The result was a 3-2 defeat.
　　Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long watched the match and, after the match, met with all the athletes and staff of the Tirana football team and the Tirana volleyball team, and took a group photo with them and the athletes of the "United First" team.
　　After the kickoff, the visiting team used a flanking tactic on both wings, launching continuous attacks. After ten minutes of fierce fighting, the home team still had not mastered the defensive tactics of "man-to-man" combined with "zonal defense," exposing some gaps, giving the opponent opportunities to attack. In the sixteenth minute, the visiting team’s left-winger Deda got the ball on the left side near the center line. He saw that the home team's defenders had not retreated in time and made a long pass to the right-winger Dalushi near the home team's goal. After Dalushi got the ball, he feigned a forward drive, and just as the home team's goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen moved into position to catch the ball, he cleverly flicked the ball lightly to the center, where center forward Nagini caught up and fired a powerful shot, sending the ball straight into the net. The visiting team opened the scoring.
　　Although the "United First" team lost a goal, they were full of confidence and calmly responded to the challenge. They quickly overcame the shortcomings of being out of position and noticed the weakness of the opponent's empty center, and launched an attack. In the thirty-fourth minute of the match, midfielder Zhang Jingtian took a free kick in the midfield, accurately kicking the ball into the open space in front of the visiting team's goal, which surprised the visiting team's defenders and goalkeeper. At this moment, left inside forward Fang Renqiu, quick-eyed and quick-footed, volleyed the ball into the net before it landed, making the score 1-1. Less than a minute later, home team center forward Nian Weis made a direct run from the midfield, and upon being blocked, he dodged to the left and took a shot, but the ball bounced off the opponent's defender. At this time, the goalmouth was already crowded, making it difficult to shoot. Nian Weis had a flash of inspiration, and kicked the ball high in the air with a backheel. Left winger Cong Zheyu and the opponent's goalkeeper Josh Yaziqi jumped up to contest for the ball, and Cong Zheyu headed the ball into the net, making the score 2-1. This score was maintained until the end of the first half.
　　After the first half, both teams noticed each other's weaknesses and adopted countermeasures. The visiting team adopted an all-out offensive tactic based on the weakness of the opponent's loose man-to-man marking, often pressing all their players into the half-court for a fierce attack. The home team not only strengthened the midfield defense but also took advantage of the opponent's weak center to advance. In the nineteenth minute, visiting team midfielder Kraja scored a goal, tying the score at 2-2, which made the spectators worry about the outcome of the match, and the battle on the field became even more intense. However, the home team's forward Zhang Honggen quickly scored a goal in the thirtieth minute. The match ended with a score of 3-2, with the "United First" team winning. (Shi Yuzhong)

　　地拉那足球队酣战“联一”队
　　我“联一”队以三比二取胜
    本报讯  昨天下午，阿尔巴尼亚地拉那足球队在北京市先农坛体育场与我国“联一”队比赛，这是访问我国的最后一场友谊比赛。结果以二比三失败。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理贺龙观看了这场比赛，并在球赛结束后接见了地拉那足球队和地拉那排球队的全体运动员和工作人员，并同他们和“联一”队的运动员合影留念。
    开球后，客队使用两翼包抄的战术，连续发动进攻。激战十分钟后，主队仍然没有掌握好“人盯人”结合“区域联防”的防守战术，露出了一些空隙，使对方获得袭击的机会。到第十六分钟时，客队左翼德达在靠近中线的左边得球，他看准了主队后卫没有及时退回，一脚长传把球递给靠近主队大门的右翼达卢希。达卢希得球后，假装着往前带进，主队守门员黄肇文刚刚移动位置准备接球，他却巧妙地将球轻拨中路，中锋纳吉尼赶上一记猛射，球直飞网底。客队首开纪录。
      “联一”队虽然失了一球，但他们信心百倍，沉着应战。他们很快地克服了乱离岗位的缺点，而且觉察出了对方中路空虚的弱点，采取了进攻。比赛进行到三十四分钟时，前卫张京天在中场罚球，他不偏不倚地把球踢在客队门前的空当，这使得客队后卫和守门员都吃了一惊。这时，眼明脚快的左内锋方纫秋不等球落地飞起一脚，球中网，踢成一比一。不到一分钟，主队中锋年维泗从中场带球直入，遇阻向左拐弯一射，球中对方后卫身上弹出。这时门前已是“千军万马”甚难射门。年维泗急中生智，倒勾一脚将球高高吊起，左翼丛者余和对方守门员乔什亚齐齐跳起相争，结果球被丛者余用头顶入网中，形成了二比一的局面。这个比数一直保持到上半场终了。
    经过上半时的战斗后，两队都觉察出了对方的弱点，分别采取了对策。客队根据对方人盯人不牢的弱点采取了全面进攻战术，经常全部人马压到半场，进行猛攻猛打。主队不但加强前卫加强防守，而且还利用对方中路薄弱从中挺进。到十九分钟时，客队前卫克拉亚先踢入一球，形成二平的局面，这使观众们为双方的胜负担心，球场上的战斗更加紧张起来。但是很快地主队前锋张宏根在三十分钟时踢进一球。全场以三比二结束，“联一”队胜。  （施毓忠）
