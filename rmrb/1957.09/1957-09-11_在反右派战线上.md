On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　Xi'an Scientific Workers Defeat Rightist Zhou Yao

　　Xi'an scientific workers defeated Zhou Yao, a professor at Northwest Agricultural College and a "general" who attacked the Party.

　　Zhou Yao consistently hated the Party. Right after liberation, he shouted: "The Communist Party only has thirty years left; I will live to see its demise in my lifetime." In every movement, he opposed the Party's policies. During the great blooming and contending, he viciously attacked the school's Party committee system, advocating so-called "professor-led schools." In order to abolish the Party's leadership over science, he even arrogantly proposed to "abolish the Academy of Sciences." After mass exposure and pursuit, this rightist element admitted that his anti-communist and anti-socialist purpose was to lead the universities to the path of European and American-style schools.

　　Extremely Fabricating Slanders Against the Personnel Secrecy System

　　Liu Yingtai's Reactionary Features Fully Exposed

　　Liu Yingtai, a rightist element in the Inner Mongolia Grain Bureau, launched a massive attack on the Party and socialism. He slandered the state personnel secrecy system as having "three-izations": rampant secrecy, mysterious personnel agencies, and the authoritative nature of personnel security cadres. He believed that these "three-izations" "caused a very bad influence on the Party among the masses" and that it was "a reinforced concrete tool for building walls and digging trenches." He also fabricated that the Grain Bureau deliberately did not make conclusions about people with historical problems, saying, "Every movement brings out people with historical problems to criticize them, like catching a monkey, painting its face, and gathering some people. The masses and Party members hold whips and 'tease the monkey.' If the history is clarified, there will be nothing to tease in future movements."

　　All the staff of the Grain Bureau have used reason and facts to forcefully counter Liu Yingtai's reactionary remarks, and Liu Yingtai himself has had to bow his head and admit his guilt.

　　Attempt to Usurp Leadership Failed

　　Li Fengsun Already Surrounded by the Masses

　　Li Fengsun, an academic committee member of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, a professor at Hunan Agricultural College, and the organization member of the Agricultural College branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, has had his ugly features as a right-wing ambitious person exposed by the masses. In the early stage of the rectification campaign, Li Fengsun vigorously attacked the Party's leadership and the socialist system. He also formed a small clique with other right-wing elements in the college's Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, such as Ling Yeguang and Luo Caicheng, to carry out conspiracies against the Communist Party and to usurp the school's leadership. He also instructed students to "find ways to get to the Ministry of Higher Education and the Provincial Party Committee" to get him appointed as president. On June 6th, right-wing elements incited a small number of students to surround the residence of the president (a Communist Party member), making unreasonable demands on the leadership. The next day, Li Fengsun, despite being ill, contacted these students and praised them for being "smart and capable."

　　Li Fengsun joined the Kuomintang twice, colluded with reactionary leaders such as Chen Cheng, Wang Dongyuan, and Sun Zuoqi to engage in many anti-communist activities. Now, the college's faculty and staff are continuing to engage in reasoning struggles with Li Fengsun.

　　在反右派战线上
    西安科学工作者击溃右派分子周尧
    西安科学工作者击溃了向党进攻的猛将、西北农学院教授周尧。
    周尧一贯仇恨党，刚解放时他就喊：“共产党只有三十年光景，我今生会等到它的灭亡。”在历次运动中，他都反对党的政策。大鸣大放中，他恶毒地攻击学校的党委制，主张所谓“教授治校”。为了取消党对科学的领导，他甚至狂妄地提出要“取消科学院”。经过群众揭发和追击之后，这个右派分子承认他反共反社会主义的目的是想把高等学校引向欧美式学校的道路上去。
    极力捏造污蔑人事保密制度
    刘盈泰反动面貌全部暴露
    内蒙古粮食厅右派分子刘盈泰，向党向社会主义大肆进攻。他污蔑国家人事保密制度有“三化”：保密制度的泛滥化，人事机构的神秘化，人事保卫干部的权威化。他认为这“三化”“给党在群众中造成了很坏的影响”，它是“筑墙挖沟的钢筋水泥和有力工具”。他还捏造说：粮食厅故意不给历史有问题的人作结论，“每次运动都把历史有问题的人提出来反一顿，好像抓来一个猴，打上三花脸，招来一些人，群众与党团员手拿鞭子‘耍猴子’一样。如果历史给弄清楚了，再遇运动就没有可耍的了。”
    粮食厅全体职工已用道理和事实，有力地回击了刘盈泰的反动言行，刘盈泰自己也不得不低头认罪。
　　篡夺领导权野心未逞
　　李凤荪已被群众包围
    中国农业科学院学术委员、湖南农学院教授、农工民主党农学院支部组织委员李凤荪的丑恶的右派野心家的面貌已被群众揭露出来。在整风初期，李凤荪即大肆攻击党的领导和社会主义制度，还和学院里的农工民主党内另外几个右派分子凌业光、罗采澄等组织小集团，进行反共和篡夺学校领导权的阴谋活动，并指示学生“设法通过高教部和省委”来提他当院长。6月6日，右派分子煽动少数学生，包围院长（共产党员）住宅，无理要挟领导。第二天，李凤荪便抱病和这些学生取得联系，表扬他们“聪明能干”。
    李凤荪曾两次加入国民党，和反动头子陈诚、王东原、孙佐齐等勾结搞过很多反共活动，现在，学院教职员正继续与李凤荪进行说理斗争。
