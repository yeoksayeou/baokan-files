Xinhua News Agency, 31st—The donation campaign launched by the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to support agricultural cooperativization has concluded. A total of more than 24.27 million yuan has been donated, enough to build thirty-six agricultural tractor stations and two agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants in various parts of the country.

The donation work of the troops began in February of last year. Encouraged by the high tide of socialist transformation, officers and soldiers enthusiastically donated money. Many units exceeded the expected donation figures within a few tens of minutes.

The tractor stations donated by the troops have been established since last year. Fourteen stations have already been completed and put into production, and seventeen stations are about to be put into production. These tractor stations are located in almost all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, possessing a total of more than 1,100 standard tractors, as well as some other agricultural machinery.

With the agreement of the General Political Department and the Ministry of Agriculture, all tractor stations established with donations from PLA officers and soldiers will be uniformly referred to as "August 1st" Tractor Stations, prefixed with the name of the locality where each station is located. The Political Department of the Volunteer Army has also decided to name the tractor stations established with donations from the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army as "Volunteer Army Tractor Stations."

    对农业合作化的有力支援
    人民军队捐献拖拉机站三十六个
    新华社31日讯  中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军广大官兵，为了支援农业合作化发起的捐献拖拉机运动已告结束，共捐款二千四百二十七万多元，可以分别在全国各地建成三十六个农业拖拉机站和两个农业机械修配厂。
    各部队捐献工作从去年2月开始。官兵们在社会主义改造高潮的鼓舞下，踊跃捐款。许多单位在几十分钟内超额完成预计的捐献数字。
    部队捐献的拖拉机站，从去年开始建立，现在已建成投入生产的有十四个站，将要投入生产的有十七个站。这些拖拉机站几乎遍布全国各省、市和自治区，共拥有拖拉机一千一百多标准台，还有一些其他的农业机器。
    经总政治部和农业部商定，凡解放军官兵捐款建立的拖拉机站，统称为“八一”拖拉机站，并在前面冠以各站所在地的地名。志愿军政治部也决定将志愿军官兵捐款建立的拖拉机站定名为“志愿军拖拉机站”。
