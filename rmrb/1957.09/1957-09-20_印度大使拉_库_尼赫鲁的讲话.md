　　Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:
　　I am very pleased to welcome you to the opening ceremony of this exhibition, which is the first industrial and handicraft exhibition held by India in China. Today, we are very honored to have Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice President Radhakrishnan, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other Chinese and foreign friends attending our ceremony. I extend a warm welcome to them and thank Your Excellency the Vice Chairman for agreeing to cut the ribbon for this exhibition.
　　Two and a half years ago, Asian and African countries gathered in Bandung to discuss ways to ease international tensions and promote world peace. These countries have different backgrounds and different political systems, but they have many common problems and recognize the need for closer cooperation with each other. In the final communique of this meeting, they expressed their conviction that friendly cooperation will not only help ensure peace but also help achieve common prosperity and happiness.
　　We are now holding this exhibition in the spirit of the Bandung Communique. Cooperation certainly includes further understanding between each other, and exhibitions help to enhance understanding. Therefore, we warmly welcomed China to participate in the International Exposition in Delhi about two years ago. China's exhibits were of the highest quality, and they left a deep impression in India. Now, we are holding an exhibition here. Although transportation and other difficulties have prevented us from organizing a truly representative exhibition, we hope that the exhibits displayed here will give you some understanding of the current industrial and other developments in India.
　　Our two countries—India and China—have many fundamental similarities. We have a long history of friendship, and although we have been isolated from each other for more than a century, we have now restored our original ties. This connection has been restored at a time when both of our countries are engaged in largely similar nation-building work. We both need a peaceful environment to accomplish this task, and we have jointly developed a set of principles for handling international relations. These principles are conducive to creating the aforementioned peaceful environment.
　　Our economic and social problems are also similar in many ways. Our two countries have the largest populations in the world, and the economies of both countries are mainly based on agriculture. Due to the imbalance between industry and agriculture, we have been weakened in many ways and have suffered in the past as a result. Our resources are certainly rich, but they are relatively underdeveloped, and our living standards are low. The basic problem we face in India is how to rapidly increase production, especially how to rapidly increase agriculture, to support industrialization and at the same time meet the needs of a growing population for higher living standards.
　　Similar problems exist in other countries, and we are very interested in China's experience. We have sent several delegations to learn from China's experience and study China's development. India also has similar developments, and various Chinese delegations have also visited our country. Mutual cooperation is developing in this way, and today we are showing the Chinese people some of the results of our experience at this exhibition.
　　A booklet that will be given to you soon briefly records these results. I cannot say that the introduction in this booklet is complete, but it may give you some idea of ​​the direction of our development. You will see that India, like China, experienced a period of economic recovery after independence. This period was about three years, and then the Planning Commission was established. The first Five-Year Plan started in 1951 and was completed in 1956. The second Five-Year Plan is being implemented and will soon complete its second year.
　　Our economy has both public and private sectors, and the private and public sectors are closely integrated. Investment in the public sector shows that the first Five-Year Plan prioritized the development of agriculture, irrigation, electricity, social welfare, and rural construction. Investment in the transportation industry is also huge, while investment in industry is relatively small. In general, our goal is to strengthen the agricultural base and the technical base of the economy, and to create a new force among the people to promote rapid progress before starting large-scale industrialization.
　　The focus of the second Five-Year Plan has shifted somewhat. Total investment in all aspects has increased, but the percentage increase in industry is the largest. In the public sector alone, the increase in industrial investment will reach nearly five times. The ratio of investment in the public and private economies has changed from fifty to fifty in the first Five-Year Plan to sixty-one to thirty-nine in the second Five-Year Plan. This fact illustrates the growing importance of the public sector.
　　India is undergoing large-scale industrialization with heavy industry as its core. We also face some difficulties in the development of other economies. But what we are striving to achieve is a balanced economic development, thereby increasing national income, eliminating social and other inequalities, raising living standards, and building a happier life for the people.
　　I thank you once again for your presence and warmly welcome you.

### 印度大使拉·库·尼赫鲁的讲话

　　印度大使拉·库·尼赫鲁的讲话
    阁下，女士们和先生们：
    我十分愉快地欢迎你们来参加这个展览会的开幕典礼，这是印度在中国举办的第一个工业和手工艺方面的展览会。今天，朱德副主席、拉达克里希南副总统、周恩来总理和其他中国和外国的朋友们出席了我们的典礼，我们感到十分荣幸。我对他们表示热烈的欢迎并感谢副主席阁下同意为这个展览会剪彩。
    两年半以前，亚非国家在万隆聚会，讨论了缓和国际紧张局势和促进世界和平的途径。这些国家具有不同的背景和不同的政治制度，但是他们有许多共同的问题，并且认识到有互相更加紧密合作的必要。在这次会议的最后公报中，他们表示确信：友好合作不仅将有助于保障和平，而且也将有助于达到共同的繁荣和幸福。
    现在我们是根据万隆公报的精神来举办这个展览会。合作当然包含着相互间进一步的了解，展览会有助于增进了解，因此，我们在大约两年以前曾经热烈地欢迎中国参加德里的国际博览会。中国的展品都是最高级的，它们在印度留下了深刻的印象。现在，我们在这里举办展览会。虽然由于运输和其他困难使我们不能组织一个真正有代表性的展览会，我们希望在这里所陈列的展品能够使诸位对印度现在的工业和其他方面的发展情况有所了解。
    我们两个国家——印度和中国——有许多基本相同的地方。我们有着悠久的友好历史，虽然一世纪多以来我们曾被相互隔绝，但是现在已经恢复了原有的联系。这种联系是在我们两国都在从事于大体上相似的建国工作的时候恢复的。我们都需要有一个和平的环境来实现这个任务，我们也已经共同发展了一项处理国际关系的原则。这种原则是有助于造成上述的和平环境的。
    我们的经济和社会问题在许多方面也是相似的。我们两国的人口在全世界为最多，我们两国的经济都是以农业为主。由于工业和农业间的不平衡，我们在许多方面被削弱了，并且因此在过去遭受了苦难。我们的资源固然是丰富的，但是开发得还比较少，我们的生活水平是低的。我们在印度面临的基本问题是如何使生产迅速增长，特别是如何使农业迅速增长，以支持工业化并同时满足日益增长的人口的更高生活水平的需要。
    在其他国家也存在着类似的问题，而我们对中国的经验感到很大的兴趣。我们曾经派遣过一些代表团学习中国的经验和研究中国的发展情况。印度也有相似的发展情况，中国的各种代表团也访问过我们的国家。互相的合作就是这样地发展着，今天我们就在这个展览会上向中国人民展示我们经验的一些成果。
    很快就要送给你们的一本小册子，简要地记载着这些成果。我不能说这本小册子的介绍是很完全的，但它或许能使你们对我们的发展方向得到一些概念。你们将会看到：印度和中国一样，独立之后随着有一个经济恢复的时期。这一时期大约是三年，然后才设立了计划委员会。第一个五年计划从1951年开始，1956年完成。第二个五年计划正在执行中，不久就将完成它的第二个年度。
    我们的经济有公营部分也有私营部分，私营部分和公营部分密切地结合着。公营经济的投资表明：第一个五年计划优先发展农业、灌溉、电力、社会福利和农村建设事业。交通运输业的投资也是巨大的，工业的投资则比较小。概括的说，我们的目的是加强农业基础和经济的技术基础，并在开始大规模工业化以前在人民中间造成一种推动迅速前进的新力量。
    第二个五年计划的重点有些转移。各方面的投资总额都有增长，但以工业的增长百分比为最大，仅仅在公营部分，工业投资的增长要达到将近五倍。公营和私营经济的投资额的比例已由第一个五年计划的五十比五十变为第二个五年计划的六十一比三十九，这一事实说明了公营部分的日益增长的重要性。
    印度正在进行大规模的、以重工业为核心的工业化。在其他各种经济的发展中，我们也面临着一些困难。但是我们所要争取实现的是经济的平衡发展，从而增加国民收入，消除社会的和其他的不平等现象，提高生活水平，为人民建设更幸福的生活。
    我再一次感谢你们的光临，并热烈地欢迎你们。
