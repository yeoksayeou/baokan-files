    Cotton Bumper Harvest, Pick Quickly and Sell Quickly
    Anhui
    (Our newspaper reports) Anhui Province's nearly three million mu of cotton fields, due to the higher temperatures and strong sunshine since the beginning of autumn, have generally matured earlier, and a bumper harvest is a certainty. According to relevant departments' estimates: this year's total output of ginned cotton in the province could reach 800,000 dan, an increase of more than 50% over last year and more than 10% over the bumper harvest of 1955. Farmers in the production areas have already begun harvesting nervously, and new cotton has already entered the market in some areas.
    In order to actively support the production of the textile industry and ensure the supply of cotton cloth and wadding in the market, supply and marketing cooperatives in cotton-producing areas have made preparations for procurement and processing in advance. A total of 318 purchasing points and purchasing groups have been set up in the main cotton-producing areas, with a distance of generally between ten and twenty li from the agricultural cooperatives, so that cotton farmers can make round trips on the same day. The staff of the 22 power ginning factories belonging to the county supply and marketing cooperatives have overhauled all the ginning machines during the off-season, so that they can start production immediately after the cotton enters the factory.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have held meetings of cadres for purchasing cotton, or meetings of cotton farmer representatives, to publicize and implement the spirit of the provincial cotton unified purchase meeting, and to deploy specific tasks for the unified purchase of cotton. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are organizing large numbers of personnel to go deep into agricultural cooperatives and production teams to ascertain the actual cotton output, consult with cotton farmers to determine the amount to be retained and sold, and organize agricultural cooperatives to collectively sell new cotton.
    Shaanxi
    (Our newspaper reports) Cotton farmers in the cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi Province are enthusiastically selling newly harvested cotton to the state. According to incomplete statistics from 14 counties including Weinan, Huayin, and Sanyuan up to the beginning of September, cotton farmers have sold more than 1.17 million jin of new cotton to the state. This year, cotton farmers are not only selling new cotton earlier, but also the quality is good. Among the more than 70,000 jin of cotton purchased in Chaoyi County, 80% is grade four or above. The new cotton collected in Heyang and Huayin is also grade three and grade four, and there is very little cotton below grade four.
    In order to do a good job in the purchase of new cotton, agricultural cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas have generally held training courses for cotton grading personnel, and more than 5,000 people have received grading training. At the same time, the province has also trained more than 500 cotton inspection personnel. This year, agricultural cooperatives have also generally paid attention to improving the quality of cotton during harvesting. Now, the strength for purchasing cotton in the cotton-producing areas has been arranged and adjusted. The seed cotton processing plants newly built this year in Xianyang, Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling and other places will also be put into production one after another.
    Xinjiang
    (Our newspaper reports) Xinjiang's 1.75 million mu of cotton fields north and south of the Tianshan Mountains are growing luxuriantly, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The early-maturing cotton in the Manas River basin has already cracked and is showing its fibers, new cotton is being harvested in the Turpan basin, and the cotton around the Tarim basin, the main cotton-producing area, has also recently begun to show its fibers.
    Although the planting area of cotton in various parts of Xinjiang this year has decreased by 4.8% compared with last year, the total output of cotton is estimated to be close to or exceed that of last year. The more than 400,000 mu of cotton planted by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the People's Liberation Army can increase the yield per unit area by 17.8% compared with last year, with an average yield of more than 200 jin of seed cotton per mu.
    Jiangxi
    (Our newspaper reports) Various parts of Jiangxi Province are actively carrying out the purchase of new cotton. A bumper cotton harvest in the province is a certainty, and the total output is estimated to reach 470,000 dan, an increase of 20% over last year. Under the encouragement of the slogan "Increase cotton production to support the country," cotton farmers throughout the province are actively selling cotton. By September 15, the province had completed more than 74% of the total monthly purchase task for September. However, in many places, the cotton purchase work is not keeping up with the cotton farmers' requirements for selling cotton. The main manifestation is that the preparation work for cotton purchase is insufficient. For example, Anfu County's preparation work for purchase and ginning was done too late, and it was still unable to open for purchase by September 15. Twelve cotton-planting agricultural cooperatives in Ji'an County picked more than 100,000 jin of seed cotton and urgently requested purchase, but the Baisha cotton collection station did not make good preparations and could not purchase it. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee held an emergency telephone conference on the 20th, instructing the various administrative offices, special districts, and counties to strengthen the leadership of cotton purchase work, improve purchase efficiency, meet the cotton farmers' requirements for selling cotton, and achieve rapid collection, rapid ginning, and rapid transportation. Another noteworthy problem in the cotton purchase work is that a free cotton market has appeared in some places, such as Chongren County, where it was discovered that a rich peasant was selling seed cotton on the market at a price nearly 50% higher than the state's unified purchase price. In the Ji'an County market, the price of ginned cotton was more than double the state's unified purchase price. The meeting pointed out: Although this phenomenon is not universal, it must be prevented and banned. Cotton farmers should be educated and the policy explained to them, and they should be encouraged to sell their cotton to the state. The meeting also studied issues such as the policy of pricing according to quality and the cotton retained by cotton farmers. (Lian Bin)
    Hubei
    (Xinhua News Agency report) The total output of cotton in the 2.1 million mu of cotton in Xiangyang Special District, Hubei Province, is estimated to reach at least 500,000 dan of ginned cotton, an increase of nearly 30% over last year, which was the best year. The average yield of cotton per mu will also increase from 19 jin of ginned cotton last year to 25 jin of ginned cotton this year. Sui County, which had the best harvest last year, has again achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of nearly 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu on more than 180,000 mu of cotton this year. Many cotton fields in the northern part of Xiangyang, Zaoyang, and Guanghua counties, which have always been called "waiting for the sky to provide" by local farmers, have also had an exceptional bumper harvest this year, with an estimated yield of 20 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    In the past, due to the lack of funds, labor, and backward technology of farmers in Xiangyang Special District, the yield of cotton per mu was as low as five or six jin, and as high as only ten or so jin. It was not until after the cooperativization that this low-yield situation was changed.

    棉花丰收快摘快卖
    安徽
    本报讯　安徽省近三百万亩棉田，由于入秋以来气温较高，日照力强，因而成熟期普遍提前，丰收已成定局。据有关部门预计：今年全省皮棉产量可达八十万担，比去年增产50％以上，比丰收的1955年增产10％以上。产区农民现已开始紧张采摘，部分地区新棉已经上市。
    为积极支持纺织工业生产，保证市场棉布和絮棉供应的需要，棉产区的供销社都已提前做好了采购和加工的准备工作。各主要产棉区共设立了三百一十八个采购点和采购组，与农业社的距离一般都在十华里到二十华里之间，棉农售棉当天可以往返。县供销社所属的二十二个动力轧花厂职工，已在淡季中将所有的轧花机检修了一遍，棉花进厂后就可立即开工生产。
    各地供销社都已召开过采购棉花的干部会议，或棉农代表会议，宣传贯彻省棉花统购会议的精神，布置了棉花统购的具体任务。目前，各地供销社正组织大批人员，深入到农业社和生产队，摸实棉花产量，与棉农协商核定留用量和出售量，并组织农业社集体出售新棉。
    陕西
    本报讯　陕西省产棉区的棉农正踊跃把新收的棉花卖给国家。据渭南、华阴、三原等十四个县到9月上旬的不完全统计，棉农卖给国家的新棉已有一百一十七万多斤。今年棉农卖新棉不仅卖得早，而且质量也好。朝邑县收购的七万多斤棉花中，80％都是四级以上的棉花。郃阳、华阴所收新棉也都是三级、四级，四级以下的棉花很少。
    为了做好新棉收购工作，棉区各地一般都举办了农业社棉花分级人员训练班，受到分级训练的有五千多人。同时全省还训练了五百多名棉花检验人员。今年，农业社一般在收获中也都重视了提高棉花质量。现在，棉区收购棉花的力量已经安排和调整。今年在咸阳、泾阳、三原、高陵等地新建的籽棉加工厂，也将先后投入生产。
    新疆
    本报讯　新疆天山南北一百七十五万亩棉花生长繁茂，丰收在望。玛纳斯河流域的早熟棉花已经裂绽吐絮，吐鲁番盆地正在收摘新花，主要棉产区塔里木盆地周围的棉花最近也开始吐絮。
    今年新疆各地棉花的播种面积虽然比去年减少4.8％，但棉花的总产量估计可以接近或超过去年。人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团种植的四十多万亩棉花，单位面积产量可以比去年提高17.8％，平均每亩可产籽棉两百斤以上。
    江西
    本报讯　江西省各地积极进行新棉收购工作。该省棉花丰收已成定局，总产量估计可达四十七万担，比去年增产20％。全省棉农在“增产棉花支援国家”的口号鼓舞下，积极售棉。全省9月份的收购任务，至9月15日就完成全月任务的74％强。但不少地方棉花收购工作赶不上棉农售棉的要求。主要表现在购棉的准备工作不足。如安福县收购轧花准备工作做得太晚，到9月15日尚不能开秤收购。吉安县十二个植棉农业社摘籽棉达十万多斤，迫切要求收购，但白沙收花站没作好准备工作而不能收购。江西省人民委员会于20日召开紧急电话会议，指示各行署、专、县加强棉花收购工作的领导，提高收购效率，满足棉农售棉要求，作到快收，快轧，快运。棉花收购工作中另一值得注意的问题就是在个别地方出现了棉花自由市场，如崇仁县发现一富农在市场上出售籽棉价格高于国家统购价格近50％。吉安县市场上皮棉价格高于国家统购价格一倍多。会议指出：这种现象虽不普遍，但必须注意防止和取缔。对棉农进行教育交代政策，鼓舞他们把棉花卖给国家。会议对按质论价政策、棉农留用棉等问题也作了研究。　（连斌）
    湖北
    据新华社讯　湖北省襄阳专区二百一十万亩棉花的总产量估计至少可以达到五十万担皮棉，比年景最好的去年还要增产近三成。每亩棉花的平均产量也将由去年的十九斤皮棉上升到今年的二十五斤皮棉。去年收成最好的随县，今年又获得十八万多亩棉花平均亩产将近四十斤皮棉的大面积丰收。历来被当地农民称做“望天收”的襄阳、枣阳、光化三个县北部的许多棉田，今年也破例丰收，亩产棉花预计能达到二十斤皮棉。
    襄阳专区过去由于农民资金、劳力缺少和技术落后，每亩棉花产量低的只有五、六斤，高的也只有十来斤。合作化以后，才改变这种低产的面貌。
