The ideological struggle against the rightists in the art world this time has created favorable conditions for the unity of Chinese and Western painters, and the unity of new and old painters in the future.

Since Jiang Feng, the arsonist in the art world, and Xu Yansun, the right-wing ringleader, were exposed as anti-Party elements, many people felt that the two big stones of national nihilism and "national essence" ideology in the art world had been lifted, and that unity in the art world would be easier in the future. In fact, the criticism of Jiang Feng, Xu Yansun, and others in the art world only created favorable conditions for future unity. The anti-rightist struggle in the art world must be carried out more deeply. Because the disunity in the art world is not just a problem of Jiang Feng and Xu Yansun alone. There are still some people in the art world who share more or less the same ideas as Jiang Feng or Xu Yansun. The root of this kind of thinking must be dug out, and the anti-socialist capitalist and feudal ideologies must be thoroughly criticized. Therefore, whether it is a Chinese painter or a Western painter, whether it is a new painter or an old painter, in this anti-rightist struggle, they cannot stand by and stay out of it. They must actively participate in the struggle, and through this struggle, examine themselves, transform their thinking, and clarify the major issues of whether or not to have Party leadership and whether or not to implement the Party's literary and artistic policies, in order to achieve the goal of true unity.

Why were Chinese and Western painters and new and old painters disunited before liberation?

It should be said that there are many reasons for disunity. The fundamental reason is that there was no real ideological foundation for unity in the past. It is impossible to achieve unity by starting everything from personal interests. The so-called "literati despise each other" has been going on for a long time, and it is incomprehensible without class analysis and exposing its social roots. The disunity of painters in the past was for the sake of competing for fame, position, and market. Therefore, the painting faction struggles of the past were also mixed with sectarian struggles. Fame, position, and market are also interrelated: with fame, there are conditions for obtaining a position, and with a position, one can compete for the market. Of course, those with fame and position do not necessarily have talent. They can also use despicable means such as currying favor and flattering to gain fame and position. There will also be people who praise them, and they will be famous for a while.

Beijing is a place with a long history and culture. In recent decades, it has gathered many Chinese painters and also has a large modern Chinese painting market. Therefore, in terms of Chinese painting creation, it has preserved more traditions than other places. However, because Beijing was a so-called "imperial capital" in the past, it has a more solid feudal force than other places. For example, Xu Yansun is a typical figure of this kind of feudal ringleader. He occupied this pier, occupied this market, excluded dissidents, and did whatever he wanted, making the Chinese painting world really dark, forming a situation of large and small sectarian struggles: the Beijing school excluded the Shanghai school, freehand style excluded meticulous style, figure painting excluded flower-and-bird painting, landscape painting excluded figure painting, those who admired the Four Wangs opposed Shi Tao and Bada... All these phenomena are nothing more than starting from personal interests. When the interests are consistent, they form a gang, form a sect, and attack others. This bad style not only undermined the unity between artists, but also seriously hindered the development of art. Therefore, Mr. Qi Baishi once sighed: "Artists must understand the way of loneliness." In the old society, he could not cope with that smoky situation, so he had to lock himself in an iron gate, suffering all kinds of slander and attacks from various sects. Only because he had the support of the broad masses was he not overthrown. Mr. Huang Binhong also sighed about his experience in the north during his lifetime. He said, "Even the greatest artist needs the support of knowledgeable people!" Because his works were once dismissed as worthless by some sects in Beijing.

Then, after liberation, why are there still phenomena of disunity?

On the one hand, due to the serious national nihilism in the art world, some people denied the national heritage with a despicable bourgeois view of negating everything. In the Party, there are art leaders like Jiang Feng who stubbornly refuse to implement the Party's literary and artistic policies, which affects the unity of Chinese and Western painters, and new and old painters, and hinders the "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in art. In the Chinese painting world, it is a different situation. Many people, with an extremely conservative national essence attitude, reject any foreign influence and hinder the development of Chinese painting. They cannot see that the economic base of society has changed, and the political system has changed, but their minds remain unchanged. The new society brings conditions more conducive to the prosperity of national art than any historical period, but these people are full of resentment and feel that the new society has made everything unsatisfactory for them. Of course, in the new society, Xu Yansun and his ilk are not allowed to exclude dissidents and slander others at will, and they are not allowed to dominate one side and do whatever they want. Society has changed, but their thinking remains the same. They still try to treat people and things with feudal relationships. When they discover that the people around them are no longer willing to be deceived by him and are no longer willing to be driven by him, they develop a deep hatred for the new society. In their minds, there is no such thing as the country, society, and the people. All they care about is personal interests, the interests of small groups, and small sects. Therefore, when their personal interests cannot be satisfied, they do not care about the interests of the people, national policies, or literary and artistic policies, and they will use despicable and vicious methods to oppose everything. They not only oppose the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, not only oppose Western painting, but also stubbornly oppose any new attempts in Chinese painting creation. The Party and government leaders have repeatedly emphasized that painters should unite and that various painting schools should learn from each other. Among some so-called painters of "color-ink painting" that we have contacted, we have not heard anyone oppose traditional painting methods. They have always extended a hand of friendship to the old painters, and they have always regarded themselves as junior students, hoping to learn something from the predecessors in the Chinese painting world. However, it is because of people like Xu Yansun who stir up trouble, deceive those above and below, and sow discord, that a serious gap has been created between new and old painters.

Because some people in the Chinese painting world have sectarian emotions, they not only oppose Western painting and color-ink painting, but also oppose any minor new attempts in traditional Chinese painting. As everyone knows, Mr. Yu Feian painted traditional Song Dynasty flower-and-bird paintings, but because there were some new artistic conceptions, Xu Yansun attacked him greatly. Mr. Wu Jingting went out to sketch and painted some landscape paintings with a sense of reality. Xu Yansun and others said that it was neither Chinese nor Western, and held him back. They also used various methods to promote some young painters and suppress some old painters, promote Beijing painters and suppress Shanghai painters, and oppose the birth and growth of all new things, which not only hindered the unity of Chinese and Western painters and new and old painters, but also hindered the mutual learning of Chinese and Western painting, and hindered the development of Chinese painting.

So, how can this situation be changed? The answer is very simple: the Chinese painting cause must have the leadership of the Party.

The facts of the past eight years have proved that only the working class, only the Communist Party, truly understands and cherishes the national heritage; the bourgeois literary and artistic ideology has always been to sever history and negate the heritage. People like Jiang Feng, Li Zongjin, and Wang Xun are very specific specimens.

The Party's attitude towards the national heritage is historical and starts from the current situation of Chinese painting. Because Chinese and Western painting methods have their own strengths, in order to avoid rigid combinations and to protect the heritage, specific measures of separating first and then combining, and letting things take their natural course, have been proposed. In order to develop Chinese painting, it has also been repeatedly emphasized that we must absorb the strengths of foreign art on the basis of national traditions, and we must not only see today, but also see tomorrow. Premier Zhou's speech at the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers on the relationship between learning from foreign countries and inheriting tradition, and at the founding meeting of the Chinese Painting Academy on the issue of weeding through the old to bring forth the new, were very thorough. He demanded that Chinese and Western painters learn from each other, new and old painters learn from each other, and various schools and styles of Chinese painters compete with each other, in order to achieve letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new.

The unity of the art world and the development of Chinese painting now have all the objective conditions, and the only thing lacking is the "east wind," which is to change the subjective conditions—the ideological transformation of Chinese and Western painters and new and old painters.

This anti-rightist struggle provides a new ideological foundation for the great unity of Chinese and Western painters, new and old painters, and creates new conditions for the prosperity of artistic creation and the prosperity of Chinese painting creation.

    中西画家新老画家的团结问题
    张仃
    这次美术界反击右派的说理斗争，给今后中西画家的团结、新老画家的团结，创造了有利条件。
    自从美术界的纵火头目江丰，右派把头徐燕荪的反党面目揭发以后，很多人觉得：美术界的民族虚无主义，与“国粹”主义这两块大石头掀开了，以后美术界的团结就比较容易了。其实，美术界对江丰、徐燕荪等的批判，只是为今后团结创造了有利条件，美术界反右派斗争，必需要更加深入的开展下去。因为美术界的不团结，不仅只是江丰、徐燕荪两个人的问题，美术界还有一些多多少少和江丰或徐燕荪思想相同的人。必须挖出这种思想的根，彻底批判反社会主义的资本主义思想与封建主义思想。所以，不管是国画家或是西画家，不管是新画家或是老画家，在这次反右派斗争中，都不能袖手旁观，置身事外，一定要踊跃参加斗争，并通过这场斗争来检查自己，改造思想，弄清要不要党的领导，要不要贯彻党的文艺方针的大是大非，才能达到真正团结的目的。
    解放前中西画家之间和新老画家之间为什么不团结？
    应该说不团结的原因很多，其根本原因，在于过去没有真正团结的思想基础。一切事情从个人利益出发，不可能达到团结，所谓“文人相轻”，是由来已久的事，不通过阶级分析，暴露其社会根源，是不可理解的。从前画家的不团结，是为了争名誉、争地位、争市场，因此过去的画派斗争，也混杂着宗派斗争。名誉、地位、市场也是互相关连的：有了名声，就有了获得地位的条件，有了地位，才能争到市场。当然有名声地位的，不一定就有才能，也可以用拉拢吹拍等恶劣手段骗得名声地位，也会有人给他吹捧，也会喧赫一时。
    北京是个历史文化悠久的地方，近数十年来，聚集了不少中国画家，也有很大的现代国画市场，因此，在国画创作上，保存了比其他地方更多的传统，但是，由于北京在过去是一个所谓“帝王之都”，比其他地方有更牢固的封建势力，例如徐燕荪就是这一类封建把头的典型人物。他霸住这个码头，占领这个市场，排斥异己，为所欲为，把国画界搞得真是漆黑一团，形成大大小小宗派斗争的局面：京派排斥海派，写意排斥工笔，人物画排斥花鸟画，山水画又排斥人物画，崇尚四王的反对石涛八大……。这一切现象，无非从个人利益出发，在利害一致的时候，就结成一伙，形成宗派，打击别人。这种坏作风不仅破坏了艺术家之间的团结，而且严重地妨碍了艺术发展。所以，过去齐白石老先生曾经感叹过：“艺术家要懂得寂寞之道”。在旧社会，他应付不了那种乌烟瘴气的局面，只好把自己关在铁栅门里，受尽了各种宗派的诬陷攻击。只因为他有了广大群众的支持，才没有被打倒。黄宾虹老先生，在生前也曾感叹过自己在北方的遭遇，他说：“再伟大的艺术家，也需要有知者的支持！”因为他的作品在北京，曾被一些宗派斥为一文不值。
    那么，解放之后，为什么还有不团结的现象呢？
    一方面，由于美术界有严重的民族虚无主义，有些人以卑鄙的资产阶级观点，否定一切的态度来否定民族遗产。在党内，有像江丰这样的美术方面的领导者，顽固的拒绝贯彻党的文艺方针，影响了中西画家、新老画家的团结，阻碍了在美术上“百花齐放”。在国画界，又是另外一种情形，有许多人，以极端保守的国粹主义态度，拒绝任何外来影响，阻碍国画发展。他们看不见，现在社会的经济基础已经变了，政治制度变了，他们的头脑仍旧不变。新社会带来比任何历史时期更有利于民族艺术繁荣的条件，而这些人反倒怨气冲天，觉得新社会使他事事不如意了。当然，在新社会，是不容许徐燕荪之流再排斥异己随便诬陷别人了，不容许他再独霸一方，为所欲为了。社会变了，他们的思想原封不动，他们还企图用封建关系来对人对事，当他发觉他周围的人，不愿再受他的欺蒙，不愿再受他的驱使的时候，他就对新社会发生了深刻的仇恨。在他们心目中，无所谓国家、社会和人民，有的只是个人，只是小集团、小宗派的利益，因此，当他们的个人利益不能满足的时候，就不管什么是人民利益，什么是国家政策，什么是文艺方针，都一律要用卑鄙恶毒的方法来反对。他们不仅反对党的百花齐放政策，不仅反对西洋画，也顽固的反对国画创作上的任何一点新的尝试。党政领导上一再强调画家们应该团结，强调各种画派之间的相互学习。在我们所接触的一些所谓画
  “彩墨画”的人中，没有听说过有人反对传统画法，对老画家们也一直是伸着友谊的手，都把自己作为后学，希望能从国画界的前辈们学些东西，可是，就因为有徐燕荪之类的人从中作梗，蒙上欺下，挑拨离间，这才造成了新老画家间的严重的隔阂。
    由于国画界一部分人有宗派情绪，所以他们不仅反对西洋画和彩墨画，也反对传统的国画方面的任何微小的新尝试。众所周知，于非暗先生画的是传统的宋人花鸟，因为有些新的意境，徐燕荪就对他大加攻击。吴镜汀先生出外写生，画了些具有现实感的山水画，徐燕荪等人又说是不中不西，拉后腿。他们还用种种方法，抬一些青年画家，压一些老年画家，抬北京画家，压上海画家，反对一切新事物的诞生与成长，既阻碍了中西画家与新老画家的团结，也阻碍了中西画互相借鉴，阻碍了中国画的发展。
    那么，如何才能改变这一局面呢？回答很简单，就是国画事业必须要有党的领导。
    八年多来的事实证明，只有工人阶级，只有共产党，才是真正懂得和爱护民族遗产；资产阶级的文艺思想向来是割断历史，否定遗产的，像江丰、李宗津、王逊等人，就是很具体的标本。
    党对民族遗产的态度，是有历史观点的，是从国画的现状出发的。因为中西画法各有所长，为了避免生硬的结合，为了保护遗产，曾提出先分后合，水到渠成的具体措施。为了使国画得到发展，也一再强调，必须在民族传统基础上，吸收外来艺术的长处，不仅看到今天，而且还要看到明天。周总理在第二次文代大会上，关于学习外国与继承传统的主从关系的问题，在国画院成立大会上，关于推陈出新的问题，都讲得非常透澈。他要求中西画家，互相借鉴，新老画家，互相学习，中国画家的各种派别，各种风格，互相竞赛，以达到百花齐放，推陈出新。
    美术界的团结和国画的发展，现在已经具备了一切客观条件，而所欠的“东风”，就是改变主观条件，——中西画家和新老画家的思想改造。
    这次的反右派斗争，为中西画家、新老画家的大团结提供新的思想基础，为美术创作的繁荣、国画创作的繁荣创造新的条件。
