Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: In response to the conspiratorial activities of Party rightist elements such as Lan Yu, who attempted to alter the socialist direction of the publishing industry by opposing planning, Chen Kehan, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered a relatively systematic critique at a symposium held today by the capital's publishing industry.

During the blooming and contending period, Lan Yu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Popular Reading Material Publishing House and a rightist element, described the publishing work after liberation as "full of contradictions and jokes," and believed that one of the root causes of the aforementioned situation was the implementation of socialist planning in the publishing industry. Therefore, Lan Yu opposed the planning of the publishing industry and proposed "reducing and merging a batch of state-owned publishing houses, restoring private publishing houses," and organizing a large number of "independent publishing houses" without Party leadership. Zeng Yansheng, Peng Zigang, and other rightist elements also smeared planning as limiting individual initiative, arguing that "subject selection plans are completely unnecessary," and proposed absurd notions such as "free publication" and "free distribution."

Chen Kehan pointed out at the meeting that the implementation of planning is an important link in ensuring the leadership of the Communist Party and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism in the publishing industry. The resolute implementation of the planning policy since liberation has enabled us to better achieve proportional and focused book publishing, and to implement the Party and state's propaganda and education policies. This planned book publishing has not only enabled proletarian ideology to rapidly occupy the position, strengthened and expanded the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism, but also promoted the prosperity of science and culture. It has built a socialist publishing industry. By 1956, the number of books printed in China was ten times the highest year before liberation, 1936, and thanks to the establishment of urban and rural distribution networks, a large number of books could be quickly delivered to the hands of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and laborers.

Chen Kehan said that there are indeed phenomena of backlog or shortage of some books in China's publishing industry at present. Some of these phenomena are caused by objective reasons such as the weak material and cultural foundation of the entire country and our lack of experience in our work, which are difficult to avoid temporarily. Errors and shortcomings in this regard must be vigorously improved in future work. However, to describe the entire book and journal publishing work after liberation as "both deficient and excessive," to attribute it to planning, and to attempt to fundamentally negate planning on this basis, is entirely a shameless slander and vicious conspiracy by the rightist elements. He said that when China's publishing industry was in the state of capitalist anarchy before liberation, that was the real "extreme shortage and great excess." At that time, what was lacking was Marxism-Leninism, progressive literary works, and truly valuable scientific and cultural books, while what was excessive was reactionary books promoting feudal comprador culture and bureaucratic capitalist rule, as well as a large number of yellow publications that poisoned the people.

Chen Kehan pointed out that the real purpose of the rightist elements' vicious opposition to planning is to negate the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, so as to dump bourgeois private goods and pave the way for the restoration of the entire capitalism.

Chen Kehan said that the state's planned supply of paper for publishing is the material basis for ensuring the socialist direction of the publishing industry. Therefore, the rightist elements are also greatly dissatisfied with this. In order to completely usurp the publishing industry, arbitrarily spread poison, and attack the socialist ideological front, they have tried every means to overthrow the planned supply system of paper, seize paper resources in their hands, and serve the "freedom of publication" of the bourgeoisie.

Chen Kehan finally pointed out that usurping the leadership of the publishing industry, as a tool of class ideological struggle, is part of the entire grand conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists to restore capitalism in China with 600 million people, and opposing planning is one of the important steps to realize this conspiracy. Adhering to or opposing the planning of publishing work reflects the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road. In this struggle, we must firmly maintain our principled stand and counter the rightists' attack on the socialist front.

At the three publishing industry symposiums held on the 4th, 7th, and today of this month, many people further exposed the various conspiratorial activities of Lan Yu, this individualistic careerist, and criticized her various fallacies.

　　无政府状态便于资本主义出版物倾销
　　只有实行计划化才能保证党的领导
　　首都出版界座谈会上陈克寒系统地批判右派的反动论调
    据新华社11日讯　针对着党内右派分子蓝钰等人企图以反对计划化来篡改出版事业的社会主义方向的阴谋活动，文化部副部长陈克寒在今天举行的首都出版界座谈会上作了比较有系统的批判。
    在鸣放期间，通俗读物出版社副总编辑、右派分子蓝钰曾经把解放后的出版工作描绘成“矛盾百出，笑话百出”，并认为产生所谓上述情况的根本原因之一，就是出版事业实行了社会主义计划化。因此，蓝钰反对出版事业的计划化，并且提出了“裁减和合并一批国营出版社，恢复私营出版社”和大量组织不要党领导的“同人出版社”的主张。曾彦修、彭子冈等其他右派分子也曾污蔑计划化限死了个人的积极性，认为“选题计划根本不必要”，提出所谓“自由出版”、“自由发行”等荒谬主张。
    陈克寒在会上指出，实行计划化是在出版界保证共产党的领导和马列主义思想指导的重要环节。解放后由于我们坚决贯彻计划化方针的结果，就使我们能够较好地做到按比例有重点地出版书籍，贯彻执行党和国家的宣传教育方针。这种有计划的进行书籍出版，就不仅使无产阶级思想迅速占领阵地，加强和扩大了马列主义的宣传，并且促进了科学文化的繁荣。建设起了社会主义的出版事业。到1956年，我国书籍印行数量已等于解放前最高年份即1936年的十倍，并且由于城乡发行网的建立，大批书籍已能迅速送到广大工农劳动群众的手里。
    陈克寒说，目前我国出版界确实还存在着部分书籍积压或不足的现象，这种现象有些是由于整个国家的物质文化基础薄弱和我们工作中缺乏经验等客观原因造成的，是一时难于避免的，这方面的错误和缺点都必须在今后的工作中大力改进。但是，把解放后的整个书刊出版工作描绘成“既缺又滥”，归咎于计划化并且企图以此从根本上否定计划化，则全然是右派分子的无耻污蔑和恶毒阴谋。他说，当我国出版事业处于解放前那种资本主义的无政府状态时，那时才是真正的“奇缺大滥”。当时缺的是马列主义、进步文学作品和真正有价值的科学文化书籍，而滥的则是宣扬封建买办文化和官僚资本主义统治的反动书籍，以及大量毒害人民的黄色书刊。
    陈克寒指出，右派分子所以要狠毒地反对计划化，其真实目的是要否定党的领导和马列主义思想指导，以便倾销资产阶级的私货，为整个资本主义复辟开辟道路。
    陈克寒说，国家对出版用纸的计划供应，是保证出版事业的社会主义方向的物质基础。因此，右派分子对此也大为不满。他们为了完全篡夺出版事业，任意放毒，打击社会主义思想阵地，就千方百计地想要推翻纸张的计划供应制度，把纸张资源抓在他们手里，为资产阶级的“出版自由”服务。
    陈克寒最后指出，篡夺作为阶级思想斗争工具的出版事业的领导权，是资产阶级右派企图在六亿人民的中国复辟资本主义的整个大阴谋的一部分，而反对计划化又是实现这个阴谋的重要步骤之一。坚持或反对出版工作的计划化，正反映了社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争。在这个斗争中，我们必须坚定地保持原则立场，反击右派对于社会主义阵地的冲击。
    在本月4日、7日和今日分别举行的三次出版界座谈会上，许多人还进一步揭露了蓝钰这个个人主义野心家的各种阴谋活动，并批判了她的各种谬论。
