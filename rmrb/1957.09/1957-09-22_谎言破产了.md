The Lie Has Gone Bankrupt
　　Zhōng Lín

　　Rightists clamored that our suppression of counter-revolutionaries (肃反) movement was "extensive implication" and "one person commits a crime, and six relatives are guilty." At the recent Second Session of the Second Tianjin Municipal People's Congress, Representative Yáng Yìzhōu refuted this shameless slander. Yáng Yìzhōu and others organized a large-scale inspection team to inspect the suppression of counter-revolutionaries work in Tianjin. During their inspection, they held more than 100 symposiums, extensively listened to opinions from all sides, reviewed 175 relevant case files, and conducted investigations and research. They put forward a lengthy inspection report, and the conclusion reached was that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement was completely necessary and the achievements were enormous. They also discovered that individual units had missed counter-revolutionaries who could have been found and that some people were wrongly criticized but were immediately corrected. Not only did they not find any cases of "extensive implication" or "one person commits a crime, and six relatives are guilty," but they also found that the government, based on humanitarian spirit, provided relief to the families of counter-revolutionaries who were indeed unable to maintain their livelihoods after the counter-revolutionaries were arrested. The arrest of counter-revolutionary Xú Àilián, and the government raising her several helpless children, is a concrete example.

　　Three days after Yáng Yìzhōu's speech, the Tianjin Workers Daily published a letter to the editor from Shū Ān, the daughter of the counter-revolutionary Xú Àilián. The letter read: "My mother, Xú Àilián, was a counter-revolutionary and was arrested in the 1951 suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, leaving behind me and three younger brothers. At that time, I was only ten years old, and the youngest brother was only three years old. Because we were helpless, the government sent the four of us siblings to the Tianjin Relief Association Children's Home. ...In these extraordinary six years, my youngest brother was sent back to a relative in his hometown in 1952 to be raised; the rest of us three siblings have grown up under the care of the state. I am now studying in the first year of senior high school at Tianjin No. 6 Girls' Middle School; my brother Shū Píng has graduated from junior high school and has joined the Young Pioneers; another brother, Shū Kāng, is studying in the sixth grade of the primary school in the children's home. Our lives are all very good. The state also gives me a scholarship, and in addition to paying for food, I also have some pocket money each month. The teachers and classmates take meticulous care of me..."

　　The facts are very clear. Our struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries adheres to the principle of "every counter-revolutionary must be suppressed, and every mistake must be corrected," and adheres to the method of investigation and research, and seeking truth from facts. This ensures that "extensive implication" and "one person commits a crime, and six relatives are guilty" will not occur. Not only that, but the government, in the spirit of humanitarianism, also provides relief or raises helpless family members of counter-revolutionaries who are unable to maintain their livelihoods. So, why do the rightists distort the facts and say that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement is "extensive implication" and "one person commits a crime, and six relatives are guilty"? This is nothing more than a rumor spread by them in an attempt to use the protection of counter-revolutionaries and the establishment of so-called rehabilitation committees to obtain anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist political capital! However, in the face of the facts, their rumors have gone bankrupt again!

    谎言破产了
    锺林
    右派分子叫嚣说，我国的肃反运动是“广为株连”，“一人犯法六亲同罪”。在最近举行的天津市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上，杨亦周代表驳斥了这种无耻谰言。杨亦周等曾组织了一个规模很大的视察组，对天津市的肃反工作进行过视察。他们在视察期间，举行了一百多次座谈会，广泛听取了各方面的意见，调阅了有关案卷一百七十五件，并且进行了调查研究。他们提出了长篇的视察报告，得到的结论是，肃反运动是完全必要的，成绩是巨大的。他们也发现了个别单位有漏掉了本来可以查出来的反革命分子的事和斗错了但立即加以纠正的事。他们不仅没有发现“广为株连”“一人犯法六亲同罪”的事，反而发现了政府根据人道主义精神，在反革命分子被捕后，对他的的确无法维持生活的家属给予救济的事。反革命分子徐爱莲被捕后，政府把她的几个无依无靠的儿女抚养起来，就是一个具体的例子。
    杨亦周发言后的第三天，天津工人日报登出了反革命分子徐爱莲的女儿舒安给编辑部的信，信中写道：“我的母亲徐爱莲是个反革命分子，1951年镇反运动中被逮捕了，留下我和三个弟弟。当时，我不过十岁，最小的弟弟才三岁，因为无依无靠，政府就将我们姐弟四人送进了天津救济分会儿童教养院。……在这不平凡的六年中，我的最小的弟弟于1952年被送回原籍一个亲戚家抚养去了；其余的我们姐弟三人，在国家的抚养下已成长起来了。我现在天津市第六女子中学高中一年级学习；弟弟舒平已初中毕业，并且已入了少先队；另一个弟弟舒康，在教养院小学六年级学习。我们的生活都很好。国家还发给我助学金，每月除交伙食费外，还有一些零用钱。老师和同学们对我的爱护是无微不至的爱护。……”
    事实是很清楚的，我们的肃反斗争坚持“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，坚持调查研究，实事求是的方法，这就保证了不会发生“广为株连”“一人犯法六亲同罪”的问题。不仅如此，政府还根据人道主义的精神，救济或抚养无依无靠的无法维持生活的反革命分子家属。那么，右派分子们为什么要颠倒黑白，说肃反运动是“广为株连”，“一人犯法六亲同罪”呢？这不过是他们企图用庇护反革命分子和成立所谓平反委员会，来取得反共反人民反社会主义的政治资本，而散布出来的一种谣言罢了！可是，在事实面前，他们的谣言又告破产了！
