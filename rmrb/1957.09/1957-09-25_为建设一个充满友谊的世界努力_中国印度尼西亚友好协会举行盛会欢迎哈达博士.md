Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. The China-Indonesia Friendship Association held a grand meeting at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing tonight to welcome former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta and his wife, as well as other distinguished Indonesian guests.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu, and leaders of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association attended the welcoming meeting.

Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wirjopranoto, also attended the welcoming meeting.

Dr. Hatta was invited to speak at the meeting. He said he was very pleased that China has an organization like the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, and he hoped that the association could further promote the friendly relations between China and Indonesia.

Dr. Hatta said that friendship between nations often relies on the efforts of leaders from both sides, requiring joint efforts. He also said that he was very happy to be able to make some contributions to the friendship between Indonesia and China.

In his speech, Dr. Hatta emphasized that Indonesia and China have the same history and common goals. Both countries have suffered from imperialist oppression and have now shaken off foreign rule to gain independence, and are working hard to build their respective countries. Therefore, they should cooperate closely, help each other, learn from each other, and support each other.

Dr. Hatta concluded by saying that building a new world, a world full of brotherly friendship, is not easy, but as long as we have such an ideal and strive to achieve it, our goal will surely be achieved.

Dr. Hatta's speech was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Bao Erhan, President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, delivered a speech at the beginning of the meeting to welcome the distinguished guests. He said that Indonesia is a great country with more than 80 million hardworking and intelligent people and a long history of culture. After gaining independence, Indonesia has pursued an independent foreign policy and played an increasingly important role in the struggle against colonialism and in defense of world peace. Indonesia is one of the initiators and hosts of the Asian-African Conference, which has great historical significance. After the Asian-African Conference, Indonesia has made great efforts to implement the resolutions of the conference and promote the "Bandung Spirit." Recently, the Indonesian people, along with peace-loving people all over the world, have actively supported the just struggle of the people in the Middle East and Africa to win and safeguard national independence and state sovereignty. The Chinese people are very honored to have such a great neighbor as Indonesia. The Chinese people will unremittingly strive to further promote the friendship between the two peoples.

Bao Erhan finally asked Dr. Hatta to convey the friendship and respect of the Chinese people to the Indonesian people.

Bao Erhan also presented a banner to Dr. Hatta on behalf of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association.

At the welcoming meeting, artists from the capital also performed cultural programs for the distinguished guests.
