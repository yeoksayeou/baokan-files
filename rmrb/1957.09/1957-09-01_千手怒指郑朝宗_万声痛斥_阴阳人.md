    A Thousand Hands Angrily Point at Zheng Chaozong - Ten Thousand Voices Denounce the "Two-Faced Man"
    By Our Reporter Lei Pu
    Among the right-wing elements exposed at Xiamen University, the most ugly and vicious is none other than Zheng Chaozong, the director of the Chinese Department. This anti-communist, anti-people clown actually harbored great ambitions and sinister intentions. He had a face that was sometimes gloomy and sometimes smiling. Therefore, people gave him the nickname: "Two-Faced Man".
    Zheng Chaozong consistently touted himself as a progressive professor, claiming to be a fellow traveler of the Party and the people. However, when the Great Blooming and Great Contending began, his "two-faced man" persona was exposed. In early May, after returning to Xiamen University from Fuzhou, he spread rumors saying: Chairman Mao advocated letting everything be aired, "Let everything be voiced, the bigger the caliber of the cannon, the better." He also said that grassroots cadres were a mess and that the more fiercely and sharply the criticisms were voiced, the more they conformed to the trend of the times. Following this, he published inflammatory articles in publications such as the "Fujian League Bulletin" of the China Democratic League and the "Garden" of the Fujian Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In the article "The Righteous Spirit Has Risen" written in the "Fujian League Bulletin," he even cursed that he had "seen the dangerous juncture the country and the Party were in." Therefore, he advocated for a fundamental reform and even predicted that some "unprecedented situation was waiting ahead of us."
    While publishing reactionary remarks, Zheng Chaozong gathered other right-wing elements from Xiamen University, such as Yan Jiali (secretary of the Xiamen University branch of the China Democratic League, lecturer), and Chen Kongli (right-wing element within the Party, teacher of the Marxism-Leninism teaching and research group), to ignite two malicious fires in the school. Zheng Chaozong spread rumors targeting the Party committee system, saying: "Chairman Mao advocated that the Party committee system must be abolished." At the same time, he colluded with Yan Jiali to devise a plan to abolish the school's Party committee system, planning to establish a reactionary school affairs committee to replace the Party's leadership. In order to attack the anti-espionage policy, Zheng Chaozong used the pretext of airing views in early May to instigate some targets of the anti-espionage campaign to "pour out their grievances" to the school's Party committee. He said: "Life at Xiamen University has been made tense, terrifying, and trembling by the Party committee," as if if the Party committee system continued to exist, Xiamen University would become a world without sunlight. He called counter-revolutionaries "martyrs who sacrificed themselves for righteousness," and slandered the anti-Hu Feng struggle as a "literary inquisition" set up by the Party for intellectuals. At a trade union group meeting, Zheng Chaozong also instigated Li Tuozhi, an associate professor of the Chinese Department, to fabricate a so-called experience of a young student, openly smearing the Party's anti-espionage policy in an attempt to incite dissatisfaction among some professors with the anti-espionage policy. After the meeting, Zheng Chaozong said triumphantly to Li Tuozhi: "Today's cannon was the loudest, they (referring to the Party committee) have a headache, it's just a pity that this situation wasn't recorded on a broadcasting machine so that Chairman Mao could hear it."
    What Zheng Chaozong hated most was the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and reforming intellectuals. He published an article in the Xiamen University school newspaper "New Xiamen University" saying: "Chinese intellectuals have two hard bones. They need to be reformed, but don't reform these two hard bones as well, don't turn everyone into spineless people." He also said at a symposium convened by the Party committee: "In recent years, I have felt that my situation is: sitting in a broken boat in a big storm. The boat may sink and the person may also sink, or I may sink first, while someone comes to save the broken boat." The so-called "big storm" refers to the Party's policy towards intellectuals today. He believed that living in New China was like sitting in a "broken boat" in a "big storm," and he only hoped that "the boat would sink and the person would also sink," or that counter-revolutionaries would be restored in China and rely on them to "save" this "broken boat."
    Zheng Chaozong was also very hostile towards intellectuals who accepted the Party's leadership and leaned towards the Party. He even considered the word "leaning" to be despicable. When he heard that someone wanted to join the Party, he slandered others as "climbing up" and "opportunists." When someone wrote an article praising the Party and socialism, he satirized it, saying that it made people "feel goosebumps." He often said to the school's professors: "Don't get close to Party members and Youth League members, they will bite back." On New Year's Day this year, he also wrote a poem expressing his hatred for the Party and Marxism-Leninism. There were two lines in this poem: "It's hard to expect the middle way to be uninhibited, and although the embellished words are skillful, they are like dross." He said: Not joining the Communist Party was his way "to be uninhibited", and no matter how good Marxism-Leninism was, it was only equal to "dross."
    After the People's Daily editorial "Why is this?" was published on June 8th, Zheng Chaozong was frightened and trembled all over. However, he immediately drafted a so-called six-person declaration that "the Party's leadership brooks no wavering" to be published in the Xiamen Daily. He wanted to use this article to cover up his reactionary face with a small piece of paper, and at the same time, he wanted to create a shield for him to continue attacking the Party. On the evening of June 10th, Zheng Chaozong also said to Yan Jiali: "Publish it in a newspaper first, and then there will be no shortcomings for people to seize. If I do this, I can still raise my opinions." After this arrangement, Zheng Chaozong and Yan Jiali secretly discussed a complete and vicious countermeasure. They also separately won over people, asking people to let him see the materials exposing him first, asking people not to approach Party members, and threatening some Party members and Youth League members, saying: "You have individualism, and individualism is anti-socialist." The meaning was that if you expose me, I will bite you back.
    However, Zheng Chaozong's plot was quickly seen through. Under the momentum of the anti-rightist struggle of thousands of teachers and students at Xiamen University, Li Tuozhi in Zheng Chaozong's right-wing clique was the first to raise the banner of righteousness, surrender to the Party and the people, and strip off Zheng Chaozong's disguise as a "progressive person" in front of thousands of teachers and students. Following this, many teachers and students continuously published articles in newspapers and periodicals such as the Xiamen University school newspaper "New Xiamen University," the Xiamen Daily, and the Fujian Daily, exposing Zheng Chaozong's various reactionary words and deeds against communism and socialism. Thousands of big-character posters crowded the school walls, and there was also a couplet that read: "A Thousand Hands Angrily Point at Zheng Chaozong; Ten Thousand Voices Denounce the 'Two-Faced Man'."
    Now, Zheng Chaozong's anti-communist arrogance has plummeted. He is hiding in the dormitory called "Petofi Club" at "Da'an New Village No. 7," still calculating how to muddle through. At every meeting, although he verbally admits that he is anti-communist and anti-people, he always pushes away whatever he can push away, denies whatever he can deny, and avoids whatever he can avoid in the face of ironclad facts, finally picking a few of the smallest hats to wear on his head. Once, when he answered everyone's questions, he said that he had a fever and chills. When he had a fever, he loved the Party, and when he had chills, he had anti-Party emotions. Therefore, he concluded that he had a pro-Party side and an anti-Party side. The teachers and students of Xiamen University, however, believed that his "fever" was fake and his "chills" were real, and that his cold and hot pattern was: when there was an opportunity to take advantage of, being anti-Party was "hot," and when there was no opportunity to take advantage of, he would pretend to love the Party. This is the true face of the "two-faced man."
    Why does Zheng Chaozong hate the Party and New China so much? It turned out that as early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Zheng had taken refuge in American imperialists. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he worked in the intelligence department of the United States Information Service's Yong'an office. During this time, he wrote many articles for the Kuomintang's "Central Daily News" that slandered the Soviet Union, attacked the Chinese Communist Party, and attacked the revolutionary writers Gorky and Lu Xun. When the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty was coming to an end and the Chinese people's revolution was about to succeed, he wrote articles cheering and praising Chiang Kai-shek's rule. He demanded that "political parties standing in opposition to Chiang Kai-shek completely wake up and be loyal to Chiang Kai-shek."
    After liberation, the people forgave him, let him be a professor, and entrusted him with important positions in Fujian's literary circles (Deputy Director of the Fujian Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Director of the Xiamen Federation of Literary and Art Circles), but Zheng Chaozong did not repay kindness with gratitude and make amends for his crimes. Instead, he always stood on the anti-Party and anti-people's stand, spreading reactionary European and American bourgeois literary theories everywhere, and imparting his corrupt "philosophy of life." He consistently worshiped the traitorous writer Hu Shi, calling himself a "disciple of Hu Shi," saying that he wanted to study Hu Shi and come to a correct conclusion about Hu Shi.
    Now Zheng Chaozong's conspiracy has been completely exposed, the people's eyes have been cleared, and he cannot muddle through no matter what.

    千手怒指郑朝宗  万声痛斥“阴阳人”
    本报记者  雷普
    在厦门大学揭发出来的右派分子中，最丑恶、最毒辣的莫过于该校中文系主任郑朝宗了。这个反共反人民的小丑，居然胸怀大略，居心叵测。他有一副时而阴森森的、时而笑嘻嘻的面孔。因此，人们送给他一个绰号：“阴阳人”。
    郑朝宗一贯自诩为进步教授，说是党和人民的同路人。但是，当大放大鸣开始以后，他的“阴阳人”面孔就暴露出来了。5月初旬，他从福州回到厦门大学后，就造谣说：毛主席主张什么都放，“什么都鸣，大炮的口径越大越好”。基层干部一团糟，放得愈凶愈尖锐愈合时代潮流。接着，他又在民盟“福建盟讯”和福建文联“园地”等刊物上发表煽动性的文章。在“福建盟讯”上所写的“正气上升了”一文中，竟诅咒说，他已经“看到了国家和党处在怎样危险的关头”，因此，他主张要来个根本的改革，甚至预言：将有什么“千古未有的局面在前头等待着我们。”
    在发表反动言论的同时，郑朝宗就纠集厦门大学另外一些右派分子严家理（民盟厦门大学支部秘书、讲师）、陈孔立（党内右派分子、马列主义教研组教员）等在学校里放起两把恶毒的火。郑朝宗对准党委制散播谣言说：“毛主席主张党委制必须取消”，同时，和严家理共谋订出一套取消学校党委制的方案，计划成立一个反动的校务委员会，来代替党的领导。为了攻击肃反政策，郑朝宗在5月初旬就以鸣放为借口，煽动某些肃反对象向学校党委“诉苦”，他说：“厦门大学的生活被党委搅得紧张、恐怖、战栗”，似乎党委制再存在下去，厦大就会变成暗无天日的世界了；他称呼反革命分子是“杀身成仁的烈士”，污蔑反胡风斗争是党为文人设置的“文字狱”。在一次工会小组会上，郑朝宗并唆使中文系副教授李拓之伪造一个所谓青年学生的遭遇，公开污蔑党的肃反政策，企图煽动某些教授对肃反政策的不满。会后，郑朝宗却得意地对李拓之说：“今天的炮最响，他们（指党委）很头痛，只可惜不曾将此情况装广播机，让毛主席来听听。”
    郑朝宗最仇恨的是党对知识分子团结、教育、改造的政策。他在厦门大学校刊“新厦大”发表文章说：“中国知识分子有两根硬骨头，要改造，但不要把这两根硬骨头也改掉，不要把每个人都变成无脊椎骨的人。”他还在党委召开的一次座谈会上说：“几年来我感到自己的处境是：在大风暴中坐一支破船，可能船沉人也沉，也可能自己先沉，而破船有人来救。”所谓“大风暴”就是指的今天党对知识分子的政策，他认为生活在新中国像坐在“大风暴”中的“破船”里一样，他只希望“船沉人也沉”，或者希望反革命在中国复辟，靠他们来“救”这支“破船”。
    对于接受党的领导，靠拢党的知识分子，郑朝宗也是十分仇视的。他连“靠拢”这个词儿也认为是卑鄙的。当他听到某人要求入党时，便诬蔑别人是“向上爬”，是“投机分子”；有人写了赞扬党和社会主义的文章，他便大加讽刺说：看了使人“肉麻”；他常对学校教授们说：“不要接近党团员，他们返回来会咬人。”今年元旦，他还作了一首诗，表示仇恨党和马列主义。这首诗里有这样两句：“中行难望聊狂狷，华说虽工等稗糠”。他说：他不参加共产党才“聊以狂狷”，马列主义再好也不过等于“稗糠”一样。
    当6月8日人民日报社论“这是为什么？”发表以后，郑朝宗吓得混身发抖起来，但是他立刻起草在厦门日报上发表一个所谓“党的领导不容动摇”的六人宣言。他想利用这篇文章用片纸遮天的办法遮盖他的反动面貌，同时，还想为他继续向党进攻造成一面挡箭牌。6月10日晚上，郑朝宗还对严家理说：“先登它一报，以后就没有短处给人抓了，我这样一来，还可以再提它的意见。”这样安排以后，郑朝宗又和严家理密商了一套既完整又毒辣的对策。还分头笼络人心，要人们将揭发他的材料给他先看，要人们不要接近党员，并威胁某些党团员说：“你有个人主义，个人主义是反社会主义的。”意思是说，你要揭发我，我就反咬你一口。
    但是郑朝宗的诡计很快就被识破了。在厦大几千师生反右派斗争的声势下，郑朝宗右派小集团中的李拓之首先举起义旗向党向人民投诚，并当数千师生面前，剥下了郑朝宗的“进步人士”的外衣。接着，许多教员和学生在厦大校刊“新厦大”、厦门日报、福建日报等报刊上连续发表文章，揭露郑朝宗反共反社会主义的各种反动言行。几千张大字报挤满了学校墙壁，还有一副对联写的是：“千手怒指郑朝宗；万声痛斥‘阴阳人’”。
    现在，郑朝宗的反共的气焰已经一落千丈。他躲在被称做“裴多菲俱乐部”的“大安新村七号”宿舍里，还在划算着如何蒙混过关。在每一次会上他虽然口头承认自己反共反人民，但在铁证如山的事实面前，总是能推的就推，能赖的就赖，能躲的就躲，最后拣几顶最小号的帽子戴在自己头上。有一次他在答复大家的质问时，说他有冷热病，热起来是爱护党的，冷起来就有反党情绪，因此，断定自己有爱党的一面，也有反党的一面。厦大师生们却认为他的“热”是假的，“冷”是真的，他那冷、热的规律是：当有机可乘时，反党是“热”的，无机可乘时，就假装爱党。这才是“阴阳人”的真面目。
    郑朝宗为什么这样仇恨党和新中国呢？原来早在抗日战争期间，郑就投靠了美帝国主义者。抗战胜利以后，他又在美国谍报机关美国新闻处永安办事处做情报工作。这段时间内，他为国民党“中央日报”写了许多谩骂苏联、攻击中国共产党、攻击革命文豪高尔基和鲁迅的文章。当蒋介石王朝末日，中国人民革命即将胜利的时候，他却写文章对蒋介石统治欢欣鼓舞、赞不绝口。要求“跟蒋介石站在敌对地位的政党彻底觉悟，对蒋介石一体效忠”。
    解放以后，人民宽恕了他，让他做了教授，委以福建文坛要职（福建文联副主任、厦门市文联主任），但是郑朝宗并没有以恩报德、将功折罪。反而始终站在反党反人民的立场，到处散播反动透顶的欧美资产阶级文艺理论，传授他那腐臭的“人生哲学”。他一贯崇拜卖国文人胡适，自称为“胡适的信徒”，说他要研究胡适，要对胡适得出正确的结论。
    现在郑朝宗的阴谋已被彻底揭穿了，人民的眼睛已经擦亮了，他想蒙混过关是无论如何过不去的。
