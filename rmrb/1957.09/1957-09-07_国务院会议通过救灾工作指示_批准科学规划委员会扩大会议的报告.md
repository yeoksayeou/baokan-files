Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The State Council held its 57th plenary meeting today. The meeting first discussed the report of the Central Disaster Relief Committee on this year's disaster situation and disaster relief work, and approved the instructions on further improving disaster relief work and the organizational rules of the Central Disaster Relief Committee.

The meeting pointed out that, according to the current situation, the disaster situation nationwide is lighter than in 1954 and 1956. However, the situation is serious in some local areas. Disaster relief work is arduous, and leading cadres at all levels must personally take charge and lead the broad masses in carrying out production and disaster relief work.

The meeting discussed and approved the report by Nie Rongzhen, Director of the Scientific Planning Commission of the State Council, on the fourth expanded meeting of the Scientific Planning Commission of the State Council. This meeting was held from June 13th to 15th, and mainly discussed four issues: the national science work system, the national science and technology research plan for 1957, the plan to improve the conditions for scientific research work, and further overall arrangements for philosophy and social sciences.

The meeting approved the draft Regulations on Penalties for Public Security Administration of the People's Republic of China and decided to submit this draft regulation to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and approval.

The meeting approved the Fire Supervision Regulations of the People's Republic of China and the State Council's instructions on strengthening fire prevention work.

The meeting approved the protocol on amending the trade agreement and payment agreement between China and Syria.

The meeting approved the State Council's decision to establish the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province and abolish the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and the State Council's decision to establish the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province and abolish the Mengzi Special District and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region. The administrative region of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture consists of the six counties of Jishou, Guzhang, Luxi, Fenghuang, Huayuan, and Baojing of the original Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and the four counties of Yongshun, Longshan, Sangzhi, and Dayong, which were originally directly under the province and administered by the autonomous prefecture. The People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture is stationed in the city of Jishou County. The administrative region of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture is composed of the eleven counties of Mengzi, Kaiyuan, Jianshui, Shiping, Pingbian, Longwu, Quxi, Hekou, Honghe, Jinping, and Yuanyang in the original Mengzi Special District and the original Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, and the Mile Yi Autonomous County, and the six village offices. The People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture is stationed in Mengzi County.

The meeting approved the State Council's instructions on improving the work of enterprises, institutions, and government agencies in receiving teachers and students from schools for visits, internships, further studies, etc., and providing materials for scientific research.

The meeting also approved the State Council's measures for the appointment and removal of administrative personnel. At the same time, it also approved the draft Regulations on the Appointment and Removal of State Organ Personnel by People's Committees at and above the County Level, and decided to submit this draft to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review.

Regarding the candidates for President and Vice-Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the meeting considered that the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an academic research institution under the guidance of the State Council, and the candidates for President and Vice-Presidents should be elected from among the academicians. However, since the election system for academicians has not yet been implemented, it is suggested that the decision on the candidates for President and Vice-Presidents be nominated by the Premier of the State Council and decided by the National People's Congress (or by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress during its recess), and appointed and removed by the Chairman of the People's Republic of China. This suggestion will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for discussion and decision. The meeting finally approved the appointments and removals.
