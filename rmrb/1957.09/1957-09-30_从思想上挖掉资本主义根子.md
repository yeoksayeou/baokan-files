Eradicating the Roots of Capitalism Ideologically
Liu Jiemei (oral account), Jie Min, Nie Bin (recording)

I feel very sad. For the past half month, I haven't been able to eat or sleep well, and I've lost weight.

At the Huanggang County three-level cadre expansion meeting, I steeled myself and used vicious language to attack the Party, the collectivization movement, and the state monopoly of purchase and marketing. Why did I say such unconscionable things! What kind of person am I?

Living at the Very Bottom

My home is in Shangbahe Township, Huanggang County. Before liberation, three generations of my family worked as hired laborers, and three generations begged for food. My grandfather and mother died of starvation and illness while begging, my uncle died while working as a hired laborer in another village, and my two younger sisters, both under the age of ten, were forced to be given away to others as child brides. I begged for food for twelve years, worked as a hired laborer for ten and a half years, and suffered all kinds of hardships, humiliations, and shed tears of bitterness. My left hand was broken by a landlord's henchman and is now disabled; my leg was bitten by a landlord's dog and still has scars.

Begging for food became increasingly difficult. On New Year's Eve in 1930, when the snow was three feet deep, wealthy families were setting off firecrackers to celebrate the New Year, while my family of five carried empty begging baskets and a tattered quilt, wandering to a dilapidated temple. My mother, children, and father hugged the tattered quilt and cried, starving for three days. On the third day of the New Year, we went out to beg again. The whole family scattered while begging. My grandfather starved to death in a foreign land.

I begged for food until 1943, when, through introductions, I managed to get a small plot of land to rent from landlord Gao Bisheng. The whole family worked desperately for a year, only to incur a high-interest debt of one stone of grain. Gao Bisheng believed that my family was too poor to qualify to rent his land and immediately took back the land that year.

In the old society, I lived at the very bottom!

During the Democratic Revolution

Liberation came in 1949. In July, as soon as District Party Secretary Han Dagang arrived in Shangbahe Township, he inquired about my poverty and suffering and asked me to go out and work.

Secretary Han saw that my family was having financial difficulties, gave my family sixty catties of rice, asked his wife to make me a new quilt, and other comrades bought me a pair of galoshes and an umbrella.

The township was preparing for the anti-hegemony campaign, and thousands of people elected me as their representative. I thought to myself, a person like me, who couldn't even find the door to begging for food, was suddenly so respected. Isn't this liberation?! I threw myself into it day and night, using my suffering to inspire others, mobilizing the masses, and struggling against the local bullies.

In April 1950, I was promoted from chairman of the township farmers' association to work team leader. I joined the Communist Party in November. I got married in December.

Whether it was engaging in rent reduction and anti-hegemony campaigns, or land reform, I was always rated as a model worker. I can't read a word, but I received a huge pile of notebooks as awards. I thought to myself, this time I've been liberated enough: I have a political status, I have honor in my work; the land reform has filled my big "pit," and all five major properties were divided among us with the best ones given to me. At this time, my heart was captivated by the complete set of furniture, farm tools, oxen, six acres and three points of high-quality land, and the newly married wife I received during the land reform.

Thoughts Went Astray

After the land reform, my thoughts went astray. My mind was always focused on the several acres of good land and good farm tools I had received. I thought that in a few years I would be able to live the same kind of life as Cao Qizhai in the village, and my heart itched. Cao Qizhai's style was impressive, with more than twenty acres of good land, more than ten tiled houses, a hired laborer who was paid over a hundred yuan a month, plus lending money at interest and making cloth business on the side. He was almost classified as a rich peasant during the land reform, and his life was better than anyone else's.

In places where the land reform ended early, the Party called for vigorous development of production, and I was happy to hear that. Around March 1952, when I was helping with land reform in Dianqiao Township, my wife ran seventy miles to see me one day. She said, "The men in the village are all at home after the land reform, and they're living happily. Only you are still staying out late; as long as you promise to come home, I'll work hard, and I'm not afraid of not living as well as that family." We discussed it over and over, and we still thought that farming was the way to go. I had six acres and three points of good land, and I could reclaim more than three acres of wasteland. My uncle Liu Jifu had an oil press, and I could partner with him, and I could earn more than thirty yuan a month. Over the year, we wouldn't be able to finish eating or spending it all. To get rich, you still have to go back to farming. Like Cao Qizhai!

At that time, engaging in land reform was a glorious thing, so I told her: "Don't tell anyone yet, or it will become 'retreatist thinking'."

Even if I didn't say it, others could see my ideological problem. In the past, engaging in land reform in my own township was like celebrating a happy event. When Dianqiao Township distributed the fruits of the land reform, I couldn't be happy. I thought: "Meetings, staying up late, isn't it just helping others?"

From then on, I was no longer a model worker.

After the Rise of Capitalist Thinking

Cao Qizhai! I always thought about Cao Qizhai.

1953 was another bumper harvest year. When I went home, I saw a big pile of grain in my father's house. It was like seeing Cao Qizhai again. Looking at the grain pile, I said to my father, "Look at Cao Qizhai's life, we'll catch up with him in a few years." At this time, I already had a small plan: Lend out five stone of grain, plus my salary as a cadre of two hundred yuan a year.

This year, the state monopoly of purchase and marketing was implemented.

At the cadre expansion meeting, when we discussed the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period, I couldn't listen; when we discussed the importance of state monopoly of grain purchase and marketing, I thought of the five stone of grain in my father's house; when others exposed the ugliness of capitalism, I thought: "Aren't they earning money by their ability?" I didn't listen to a word of the discussion. I thought: "No matter how well you say it, you still want me to sell grain. This five stone of grain is what I'm going to use to get rich!"

Sure enough, after two days of discussion, we had to report our surplus grain. At this time, I originally wanted to not report, but everyone knew that I was a Party member, and it wouldn't be good not to report anything, so I gritted my teeth and reported one stone and five dou, hiding three stone and five. I thought, I won't let you take this three stone and five no matter what.

The state monopoly of grain purchase and marketing work began in the township. I became even more worried about the five stone of grain in my house. Before the state monopoly of purchase and marketing was completed, I borrowed a bicycle and rushed home. When I got home, I didn't even sit down before going into my father's room. I looked and the grain pile was gone. My plan to get rich was ruined! I turned the bicycle around and shouted at my father, I jumped up and down and cursed.

I was so angry that I didn't even want to eat. I went to my room and slammed the closet door loudly. At this time, I found two stone of grain in the corner of the closet. I was happy, the grain hasn't been sold yet? My wife said, "Liu Minghai had financial difficulties last year and borrowed four yuan and four jiao from me, which was worth one stone of grain (the price of grain at the time was five yuan and six jiao), and this year he returned two stone with interest." There were also two bolts of cloth in the closet, one of which had been borrowed by someone and returned as two bolts.

Liu Minghai, like us in the past, had worked as a hired laborer his whole life, and only turned over after the land reform. Later, a strong laborer died, and life became difficult again. At that time, I only wanted to get rich and forgot that I was a Communist Party member. I thought, we all turned over in the land reform, and we all got land, like boats in a river, pulling up the sails and starting together, some are moving forward, some are falling behind, who can you blame if you fall behind.

In the first half of 1954, my village organized a cooperative. Liu Mingyan came to mobilize me to join the cooperative. I was working outside and didn't know what a cooperative was like. My family hired people to work, and we received twenty-five stone of grain a year. After deducting food, drink, expenses, labor, and fertilizer, we still had five or six stone of grain left, and that was my capital to get rich! What would happen if I joined the cooperative? If I didn't work, I wouldn't have any income. So I didn't even think about it and agreed to him, saying, "I won't join the cooperative." At that time, I also had an idea: if the state monopoly of purchase became more strict, I could still lend out grain at interest. The two stone of grain from my wife had not been purchased. Liu Yansheng (middle peasant) also had more than twenty stone of grain lent out at interest in 1954. If I joined the cooperative, I wouldn't be able to hire people, lend money, or hoard grain. So I resolutely refused to join the cooperative. But when I came back from flood control on the dam in the second half of the year, my family had signed up to join the cooperative. I was very angry: even my father didn't agree with me!

This year, my father didn't work much in the cooperative, and my wife didn't work at all. In the past, if we didn't work, we would hire workers, but now if we didn't work, we wouldn't have any income. After doing the math, we did have more than twenty yuan less income. I was convinced that the cooperative had no advantages. In fact, I said that the cooperative had no advantages because it blocked my path.

In 1956, it was converted into an advanced cooperative. I complained, saying, "Forget it, let's just pretend that the land reform didn't happen, let's just pretend that we didn't divide land in the land reform."

I always wanted to climb up the capitalist road. Cooperatives and state monopoly of purchase and marketing blocked my path. I was no longer of one mind with the Party.

The Party Rescued Me

At this expanded cadre meeting, the Party and comrades truly rescued me. Everyone helped me recall and compare today's life with the past, and helped me analyze and recognize my wrong thinking.

At this exhibition, the things my family used in the past and now were placed together: on one side was before liberation, and on the other side was after liberation. It was especially obvious when you looked at it. I had really forgotten my roots. At this time, more than twenty cooperative directors from Santahe Township were visiting here. They looked at each other and said, "Where is Liu Jiemei? Call Liu Jiemei to talk about how he forgot his roots." When I heard this, I was so scared that I hurried out and hid, afraid to come out, thinking that I had let down the Party, and I cried bitterly.

That night, after the lights were turned off and everyone was asleep, I lit a candle and went into the exhibition hall. I wanted to use it as a mirror to carefully examine my thinking. I looked at each item one by one. The first thing I saw was the cotton-padded jacket that had been worn for several generations. I didn't get to wear this jacket until I was twelve years old. Now, not to mention wearing it, I feel nauseous when I smell that smell. Below it was a lined pair of pants. One year it was unbearably cold, my father was sick at home, and my mother led me to beg for it from a man named Luo at the south end of Sanfu Village for my father to wear. Later, these pants were patched with five or six layers, and the original color could no longer be seen. Seeing this, I shivered. My tears flowed again. I kept looking down, and when I saw the current clothes, I couldn't help but take them off and put them together with those ragged clothes. Liu Jiemei, Liu Jiemei! Everything you wear, eat, and use today, which one is not brought by the Communist Party, by socialism? But you attacked the Party and attacked socialism. You wanted to get rich yourself, regardless of the life and death of others. I lay on the table in the exhibition hall. But I couldn't sleep, my mind was racing, and tears were streaming out. I heard the clock in the exhibition hall strike three times before I fell asleep in a daze.

After that, I came to the exhibition hall every day. The opinions written by the visitors on the table became more and more numerous. Some people blamed me for forgetting my roots, and some people scolded me, saying that my capitalist thinking was really shameful. These opinions were well written.

One day, I went to the exhibition hall again. An officer of the Volunteer Army, after seeing the exhibition, found me, shook my hand tightly, and said, "Comrade, after seeing the contrast between these two lives, I will hold my gun tighter." I was extremely moved. I couldn't say a word. I secretly made up my mind to catch up and become a strong socialist fighter.

This time the Party rescued me, the comrades all helped me, and the newspaper published my thoughts again, asking everyone to discuss them, and I will never forget the Party's great kindness. I will transform my thinking properly and not be a stumbling block to socialism. I also hope that the comrades will continue to help me and strive to make contributions in the socialist revolution.

专栏：

    从思想上挖掉资本主义根子
    刘介梅口述　洁民、聂彬记
    我心里很难过。这半个月来，吃不下饭，睡不着觉，人也瘦了。
    在黄冈县三级扩干会上，我横着心，恶言毒语的攻击党，攻击合作化，攻击统购统销。我为什么要说这些黑良心的话！我是个什么人？
    生活在最底层
    我的家在黄冈县上巴河乡。解放前，三代人打长工，三代人讨米。祖父和母亲在讨米中饿病死了，叔父打长工死在外乡，两个不满十岁的妹子被迫送给别人当童养媳。我讨米十二年，打长工十年半，也受尽了苦楚，受尽了欺辱，流尽了辛酸的眼泪。我的这只左手被地主狗腿子拖拉断了，现在成了残疾；我的一只腿被地主的狗子咬伤了，现在还有疤子。
    讨米越讨越难。1930年大年三十，下三尺深大雪，有钱人家都在放爆竹过年，我一家五口人提着空空的讨米篮子，挟着一床破被絮，流浪到一个破庙里，娘儿父子抱着一床破被絮哭，饿了三天，过了大年初三又出去讨米。全家人讨米分散了。祖父饿死在异乡。
    讨米到1943年，人托人，保托保，弄到了地主高弼生的一点佃田种。全家人拼死拼活种一年田，倒负了一石谷的高利贷。高弼生认为我家穷的没有资格种他的田，当年就夺佃“打摊账”。
    在旧社会里，我生活在最底层呵！
    在民主革命时期
  　1949年解放了。7月间，区委书记韩大刚一到上巴河乡就访我的贫，问我的苦，叫我出去搞工作。
    韩书记看到我家里生活困难，给了我家里六十斤米，叫他爱人给我做了一床新被子，别的同志又给买了一双套鞋、一把雨伞。
    乡里酝酿反霸，几千人选举我当代表。我想，我这个讨米摸不到门的人，一下这样受人看得起了，这不是翻身是什么！？我一股劲的日里夜里，以苦引苦，发动群众，斗争恶霸。
    1950年4月，我由乡农会主席提拔为工作组长。11月参加共产党。12月结了婚。
    搞减租反霸，搞土地改革，我每次都评上了模范，我一字不识，日记本子奖了一大堆。我心里想呀，这回翻身翻够了：政治上有了地位，工作上有了荣誉；土地改革把我的大“坑”填满了，五大财产都拣好的分给我。这时我的心迷到土改时分的全套的家具、农具、犍牛、六亩三分上等田和新娶的老婆上去了。
    思想开了岔
    土地改革以后，我的思想就开了岔。心里老想着自己分进的几亩好田，好农具。想到再过几年自己也能过塆里曹其斋过的那日子，心里就发痒。曹其斋那排场，二十多亩好田，十多间瓦屋，请一个长工一个月工，百多元钱放账，再加上发脚力做布生意。土改时差点没有划成富农，日子过得比谁都好。
    土改结束得早的地方，党号召大力发展生产，我听着心里就高兴。1952年3月间，我在第三批点枫桥乡帮助土改，有一天，我爱人跑七十多里路来看我，她说：“塆子里的男人，土改后，都在屋里，日子过得乐和的很，就只有你还在外面熬夜；你只要答应回家，我下蛮力干，还怕过得没有那家好。”我们盘算来，盘算去，还是种田有味。自己有六亩三分好田，再开三亩多荒地，我伯父刘吉甫有个榨坊，和他合伙，一个月也可以赚三十多元钱。一年上头，吃不完，用不完。要发家还是回去种田。像曹其斋那样！
    那时候，搞土改是个光荣事，我嘱咐她：先莫和别人说，说出来就成了“退坡思想”。
    思想问题，不说别人也看得出来。往日在本乡土改就像办喜事一样。枫桥乡分配果实，我乐不起来。心里想：开会，熬夜，还不是帮别人忙了一场。
    从这以后，我就没有当上模范了。滋长资本主义思想以后
    曹其斋！我老想着曹其斋。
    1953年又丰收了。我回家去，看见父的屋里一大囤子谷。就好像又看见了曹其斋。我看着这谷囤子，对父说：“你看曹其斋那生活，我们不要几年就会赶上他。”这时，我已经有了个小计划：五石谷，再加我当干部一年二百来元的工资，放债。
    这一年实行了统购统销。
    扩干会上讨论国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务，我听不进去；讨论粮食统购统销的重要性，我就想到父屋里的五石谷；别人揭发资本主义的丑，我想：人家还不是凭本事赚钱。大家怎样讨论的，我一句也没听进去。心里想：说得再好些，也是要我卖谷。这五石谷，我要靠它发家的啊！
    果然，讨论了两天以后，就要报余粮。这时，我本来想不报，可是别人都知道我是个党员，不报点不好，就硬起头皮报了一石五斗，瞒下了三石五。心里想，这三石五无论如何也不能让你统去。
    粮食统购统销工作在乡里展开了。我更加不放心屋里的五石谷。没有等搞完统购统销就借了部脚踏车，往家里赶。到了屋里，坐也不坐，就往父房里钻。一看，谷囤子没有了。我发财的计划打乱了！我车转身来，朝我父吼，我跳出跳进的骂。
    我气得饭也不想吃。到自己房里把衣柜的门打得山响。这时，发现柜子角里有两石谷。我一喜，谷子还没有卖完？我爱人说：“刘明海去年生活困难，在我手里借了四元四角钱，作成一石谷（当时的谷价是五元六角），今年连本带利还来的两石。”柜子里还有两匹布，也是人家借去一匹，还来的两匹。
    刘明海过去和我们一样，也给人家打了一辈子长工，土改后才翻身。后来，死了个强劳动力，日子又困难了。我当时只想发财，忘记自己是共产党员。心里想，都是土改翻的身，一样分田地，好像河里的船一样，扯起篷来一起开头，有上了前的，有落了后的，落了后的怪谁。
    1954年上半年，我塆里组织合作社。刘明焱来动员我入社。我在外面工作，还不晓得合作社是么样回事？我家里请人做活，一年收二十五石谷，除了吃喝开消、人工肥料，还要多五、六石谷，这就是我发家的本钱呵！入了社有么事，不做就没有收入。所以我想都不想，就答应他，说：“我不入社。”当时，我还有个想法：粮食统购再严格些，我还是可以有粮食放债。我爱人的两石谷子就没有购去。刘炎生（中农）在1954年也还有二十多石谷子放债。入了社，请人、放债、囤粮的事都搞不成了。所以我坚决不入社。可是等我下半年从堤上防汛回来，家里报名入社了。我气得很：连父都跟我不一条心！
    这一年，我父在社里没有劳动几多，我爱人根本没有劳动。往年，不劳动就请工做，现在不劳动就没有收入了。这样一算账，果然少了二十多元的收入。我就认定了合作社没有优越性。其实我说合作社没有优越性，是因为它拦住了我的路。
    1956年，转了高级社。我发牢骚，说：“算了，只当是没有实行土改的，只当是土改中没有分田分地的。”
    我一直想顺着资本主义的道路往上爬。合作化和统购统销拦住了我的路。我和党不一条心了。
    党挽救了我
    在这次扩大干部会上，党和同志们真正地挽救了我。大家帮助我回忆对比今天和过去的生活，帮助我分析认识了错误思想。
    这次展览会上，把我家过去和现在用的东西摆在一处：一边是解放前的，一边是解放后的。再一看特别显眼。这真是忘了本。这时，三台河乡有二十多个社主任在这里参观。他们一面看，一面说，刘介梅呢？叫刘介梅来讲讲他是么样忘了本的。我听见这话，吓得连忙钻出去，躲着不敢出来，想着自己对不起党，就大哭了一场。
    这天晚上，等电灯熄了，人都睡静了，我点起一支蜡烛，走进展览馆来。我要把它当一面镜子，仔细照一照我的思想。我一件一件地看过去。最先看见了那件穿了几代人的棉袄。我一直到了十二岁才轮着穿这件袄子。现在不要说穿它，闻到那阵气味都作呕。下面是一条夹裤，那一年冷得过不得，父在屋里病着，妈领我在三福塆南头一个姓罗的屋里讨来给父穿。后来，这条裤子补了五、六层，原来的颜色早就看不清了。看到这里我打了一阵冷噤。我的眼泪又流出来了。我一个劲的往下看，看到现在的衣服，忍不住又把它们取下来放在那些烂衣服一起。刘介梅呀，刘介梅！你今天穿的、吃的、用的，那一样不是共产党，不是社会主义带来的。可是，你攻击了党，攻击了社会主义。你想自己发财，不顾别人死活。我躺在展览会的桌子上。可是，睡不着，脑子里只打转，眼泪只往外流。听到展览馆的钟打了三下，才迷迷糊糊地睡着了。
    以后，我每天都到展览会来。桌子上，参观的人写的意见一天比一天多。有的人责备我忘了本，有的人骂我，说我的资本主义思想真是可耻。这些意见写得好。
    一天，我又到展览馆去。一个志愿军的军官，看了展览以后，找到我，握紧我的手说：“同志，我看了这两种生活的对比，我的枪杆会握得更紧。”我受了极大的感动。一句话也说不出来。我暗地里下了决心，赶上去，做一个坚强的社会主义的战士。
    这一次党挽救了我，同志们都帮助我，报纸上又把我的思想登出来，请大家讨论，我一定不会忘记党的大恩。我要好好地改造思想，不当社会主义的绊脚石。我还希望同志们继续帮助我，争取在社会主义革命中立功。
