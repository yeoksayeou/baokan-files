Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 16th: Chinese Ambassador to Syria, Chen Zhifang, told Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali on September 15th that the Chinese government and people resolutely oppose all aggressive plots and provocative actions by US imperialism against Syria.

　　When Chen Zhifang met with the Syrian Prime Minister, he expressed, on behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government, deep sympathy and support for the just struggle currently being waged by the Syrian government and people against colonialism and in defense of national independence. Chen Zhifang said that the Chinese government condemns the statement made by US Secretary of State Dulles on September 7th regarding the situation in Syria, considering it a crude and blatant interference in Syria's internal affairs.

　　Al-Assali asked the Chinese Ambassador to convey his thanks to Premier Zhou Enlai, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people. He said, "We are friendly countries, and we support each other. We will never forget the support you gave to the Arab people during the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel."

　　Al-Assali also said that, "Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries, we are full of confidence that we will defeat any plot by imperialism."

　　Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar was also present when Ambassador Chen Zhifang met with Prime Minister al-Assali. Bitar expressed his gratitude for the support of the Chinese government and people to Syria. He said, "We highly value your support."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 16th: All influential newspapers in the Syrian capital today prominently published the news of yesterday's meeting between Chinese Ambassador to Syria, Chen Zhifang, and Prime Minister al-Assali. During the meeting, Ambassador Chen Zhifang expressed, on behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government, deep sympathy and support for the struggle currently being waged by the Syrian government and people against colonialism.

　　"Victory News" ran the banner headline: "China Supports Syria and Condemns Dulles' Statement; Al-Assali Says China's Attitude Towards Our Country is Great and Noble." Other newspapers used largely the same headlines.

　　"Al-Nour" published an editorial today entitled "Arabs Pay Tribute to Great China," saying: "The Chinese Ambassador spoke on behalf of the 600 million new people who finally defeated imperialism and achieved victory in China; our people today understand the important significance of this speech."

　　The editorial expressed great gratitude for the Chinese government's statement on supporting Syria and the related comments in Chinese newspapers. The editorial pointed out that the Chinese Ambassador's speech and its importance "will make the US imperialists who pursue the Eisenhower Doctrine seriously consider their actions before carrying out aggression against Syria."

　　Most newspapers here today also published Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet in Beijing welcoming the Bulgarian government delegation, regarding his support for the Syrian people's struggle.

    阿萨利要求中国大使代他向周恩来总理、中国政府和人民表示感谢。他说，我们是友好的国家，我们互相支持。我们永远不会忘记你们在英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及期间给予阿拉伯人民的支持。
    阿萨利还说，由于苏联、中国和其它国家的帮助，我们充满信心要击败帝国主义的任何阴谋。
