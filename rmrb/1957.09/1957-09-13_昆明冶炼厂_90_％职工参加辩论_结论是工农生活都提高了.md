　　Kunming Smelter 90% of Employees Participate in Debate
　　Conclusion is Workers' and Peasants' Lives Have Improved
    Our newspaper, Kunming, 12th dispatch (reporter Qin Junguang): The Kunming Smelter has had over 90% of its workers participate in the great debate on the two roads, and in this great debate, they have received a profound socialist education.

    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the Kunming Smelter underwent large-scale expansion, and new workers accounted for more than 60% of the total number of employees. Most of these workers came from the countryside and had relatively strong individual small-peasant economic ideas. When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, some of them followed suit, shouting that "the lives of workers and peasants have not improved," and expressed dissatisfaction with agricultural collectivization and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. To correct these erroneous ideas, the Smelter's Party Committee began organizing a great debate at the end of July, and also invited Xu Shu, the deputy director of the Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Kunming, to give a report on rural living conditions. Speakers at the meeting were widespread, and the effect was very good. Old worker Dong Xiang said, "Before liberation, workers and peasants had trouble even getting enough to eat, let alone affording leather shoes and wool fabric. Now many workers, cadres, and even peasants are buying leather shoes and wool fabric. The price increase of these commodities will not affect the lives of workers and peasants; those who say that the lives of workers and peasants have not improved have forgotten their roots." Female worker Chu Liqin said, "Why are some people still dissatisfied? It's because they demand too much from life; they all want to eat well and dress well, exceeding the current level of production development." Some old workers criticized those young people who regard "wool fabric and leather shoes as necessities of life," saying, "Don't forget that necessities of life are firewood, rice, oil, and salt. The state implements unified purchase and sale of grain and the rationing of cotton cloth, which guarantees the lives of workers and peasants." Worker Wang Hong said, "My salary has increased from 30 yuan per month to 56 yuan. May I ask, which necessities of life have increased in price!"

    During the debate on whether there is a real shortage of grain in the countryside and whether the lives of peasants have improved, the workers' emotions were extremely high, and they all used their personal experiences to prove that the lives of workers and peasants had greatly improved. Communist Youth League member Lu Chunrong used his family's situation to illustrate that the family members of rural workers have a dependency mentality, are unwilling to participate in labor, and want to rely on the workers sending money home to maintain their lives. He said, "In the past, I often sent money home, and my father would sit in the teahouse, not go to the fields, and write to me saying that life was difficult." The workers also launched a debate using the example of worker Dong Shaoquan. Dong Shaoquan (of poor peasant origin) wrote to the Yunnan Daily because his family "lacked grain" and requested help in solving the problem. The newspaper社, through the Yiliang County Committee, conducted an investigation into his family. The Party Committee printed and distributed the Yiliang County Committee's reply letter and the investigation report from Dong Shaoquan's hometown agricultural cooperative to various workshops for reference. The situation of Dong Shaoquan's family is: Before joining the cooperative, his family was self-sufficient. After paying public grain, each person had an average of 438 jin of ration grain and never complained of a grain shortage. Last year, the cooperative distributed 3,586 jin of grain to his family, with an average of 594 jin of grain retained per person, but they complained of a grain shortage. The workers asked: Does this mean that the lives of peasants have not improved? Is this what is called a "grain shortage"?

　　昆明冶炼厂90％职工参加辩论
　　结论是工农生活都提高了
    本报昆明12日电　记者秦军光报道：昆明冶炼厂已有90％以上的工人参加两条道路的大辩论，并在大辩论中，受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    昆明冶炼厂在第一个五年计划期间，由于进行了大规模的扩建，新工人占职工总人数的60％以上。这些工人多数来自农村，具有比较浓厚的个体小农经济的思想。当资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，他们中间的一些人也跟着叫喊“工人农民生活没改善，”对农业合作化，粮食统购统销政策也表示不满。为了纠正这些错误思想，冶炼厂党委会从7月底开始组织大辩论，还请了昆明郊区明星农业社副主任徐树来作有关农村生活情况的报告。在会上发言的人极为普遍，效果也很好。老工人董祥说：“解放前工人农民连吃饭都成问题，那里还有人穿得起皮鞋、毛呢。现在许多工人、干部、甚至农民也买起皮鞋、毛料了。这些商品涨价，并不会影响工人农民的生活，说工人农民生活没改善的人都是忘了本。”女工褚丽琴说：“为什么还有人不满呢？是因为他们对生活要求太高了，都想吃好的、穿好的，超过目前生产发展的水平。”有的老工人批评那些青年人把“毛呢、皮鞋当生活必需品”时说：“不要忘记，生活必需品是柴米油盐。国家实行粮食统购统销，棉布定量供应，这就保证了工人农民的生活。”工人王鸿说：“我的工资由每月三十元增加到五十六元，请问，哪样生活必需品涨价啦！”
    在辩论农村是否真正缺粮，农民生活是否有改善的时候，工人们的情绪异常高涨，纷纷以亲身体会来证明工人农民生活是大大的改善了。团员陆春荣以他家的情况，说明农村职工家属有依赖思想，不愿参加劳动，想靠职工寄钱回家维持生活。他说：“过去我经常寄钱回家，父亲就坐茶馆，不下地，并给我来信说生活有困难。”工人们还以工人董绍权为例展开了争论。董绍权（贫农出身）因家中“缺粮”，曾向云南日报写信要求帮助解决。报社通过宜良县委会，对他家进行了调查。党委会把宜良县委会的回信，及董绍权家乡农业社的调查报告，印发各车间作为参考。董绍权的家庭情况是：未入社前，他家是个自足户，除缴公粮外，每人平均有口粮四百三十八斤，没有叫过缺粮。去年，合作社分给他家三千五百八十六斤粮食，每人平均留粮五百九十四斤，反而叫喊缺粮。工人们问道：难道说这是农民生活没有提高吗？这也叫做“缺粮”吗？
