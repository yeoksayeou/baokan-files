Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 20th: According to TASS, the head of the Soviet delegation to the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Gromyko, spoke at the meeting on September 20th. Gromyko also submitted to the General Assembly a draft declaration on the principles of peaceful coexistence among states, a draft resolution on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing for two to three years under international supervision, a draft resolution on states undertaking obligations not to use atomic weapons, and a memorandum from the Soviet government on partial disarmament measures.

In his speech, Gromyko pointed out that the overall international situation remains turbulent. He criticized the "Cold War" policy pursued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The world is still divided into mutually hostile military blocs, engaged in an arms race such as has never been seen before, and particularly dangerous is the arms race in the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Gromyko said that humanity now faces two paths: one is lasting peace, with all countries cooperating regardless of their social systems and ideologies; the other is atomic war, or at best, anxiously awaiting the outbreak of atomic war and engaging in a destructive arms race that consumes more and more human and material resources.

Gromyko said that in order to further expand international cooperation and ease international tensions, the Soviet delegation submitted a draft declaration on the principles of peaceful coexistence among states for discussion by the General Assembly.

The draft declaration calls on all countries to resolve any international disputes by peaceful means, and calls on all countries to observe the following principles in their mutual relations:

    One, mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty;
    Two, non-aggression;
    Three, non-interference in internal affairs for any economic, political or ideological reasons;
    Four, equality and mutual benefit;
    Five, peaceful coexistence.

Gromyko then spoke about the issue of disarmament. He pointed out that the situation in the Disarmament Subcommittee is very abnormal. The reason for this abnormal situation is the unwillingness of Western countries to adopt the disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, even though the Soviet government has made many concessions to other participating countries in the negotiations on many contentious issues.

Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet Union advocates a thorough solution to the disarmament issue, advocating a substantial reduction in armed forces, armaments and military expenditures, advocating a complete and unconditional ban on the use and manufacture of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the destruction of existing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Taking into account the position of Western countries and in order to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue, the Soviet government has proposed a series of partial measures.

Gromyko then spoke about the Soviet government's proposal for the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France to reduce their armed forces in three stages and to reduce conventional armaments by 15%, as well as the proposal to abandon the use of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons and to remove military bases located on the territory of other countries, and so on.

The Soviet representative submitted the Soviet government's memorandum on partial disarmament measures to the General Assembly for discussion. The memorandum contains the Soviet Union's basic proposals.

Gromyko also put forward a draft resolution on states undertaking obligations not to use atomic weapons. The Soviet government suggested that countries possessing nuclear weapons first undertake the obligation not to use atomic and hydrogen weapons for five years. If a broad disarmament agreement has not been concluded during this period, then the issue of this obligation can be discussed again after five years. The Soviet government believes that this issue must be studied separately and not be entangled with other disarmament issues.

Gromyko went on to say that the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons should also be discussed as a separate issue and a relevant agreement should be signed immediately. This would eliminate the danger of radioactive particles and atomic radiation harming human health, would prevent the arms race in the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and would prevent the emergence of new types of weapons with even greater destructive power, which rely on testing to verify their performance. This would be a practical first step on the road to the main goal – a complete and unconditional ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The draft resolution submitted by the Soviet representative on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing for two to three years under international supervision stipulates that: the testing of nuclear weapons shall be stopped for two to three years starting from January 1, 1958; an international commission shall be established to carry out supervision, and the international commission shall submit reports to the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly; on the basis of reciprocity, monitoring posts shall be established in the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, as well as in British territories and the Pacific region including Australia.

Gromyko pointed out that the small number of members and the lack of representation in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee is one of the reasons hindering the conclusion of a disarmament agreement. The whole of Asia and Africa does not have its own representatives in this body, and four of the five member states of this body are members of the North Atlantic military bloc, which is precisely the vanguard of arms expansion.

Gromyko said that the necessity of expanding the membership of the Disarmament Committee and the Disarmament Subcommittee, and absorbing representatives of countries that oppose the "Cold War" policy, implement a policy of peaceful coexistence, and are naturally concerned about the issue of disarmament, has long been ripe. The Soviet government advocates that disarmament negotiations should be conducted in public. The secretive nature of such negotiations is obviously desired by those who favor the "Cold War".

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet Union will make every effort to reach an agreement on disarmament as soon as possible, and at the same time, it is willing to clearly announce that as long as the United States, the United Kingdom, and other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization still refuse to conclude a disarmament agreement, refuse to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, refuse to stop the testing of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and as long as they continue to strengthen the combat strength of their armed forces, then the Soviet Union will take all necessary measures to reliably ensure its own security, and closely cooperate with its allies, including the allies of the defensive Warsaw Pact, to implement these measures.

When talking about the situation in the Middle East, Gromyko said that the United Nations General Assembly cannot but pay attention to the still tense situation in this region. The main reason for this situation is the continuous interference in the internal affairs of countries in the region by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, especially the United States. Someone has taken brutal political and economic pressure against Syria, is plotting conspiracies against the Syrian government, and recently has increasingly often threatened Syria with direct military intervention.

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the provocative activities in the Middle East and the deepening of tensions in this region, because this endangers its own security.

Gromyko reiterated the Soviet Union's proposal that the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should not use force in the Middle East and should not interfere in any way in the internal affairs of the countries in this region. If the General Assembly can support these principles in some form, this support will play a significant role in improving the situation in the Middle East.

Next, he reiterated the Soviet government's proposal that the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization conclude a treaty to make them undertake the obligation not to use force and to resolve all disputes through peaceful means.

He said that the Soviet side is willing to withdraw its troops currently stationed abroad in accordance with the Warsaw Treaty and other international agreements, as long as the United States and other Western countries also withdraw their armed forces stationed on the territory of European countries. The Soviet government believes that foreign troops stationed in the territory of other countries should also be withdrawn, and these troops are still stationed there under some pretext.

Gromyko then talked about the need to ensure broad and free international economic exchanges. He said that it seems that many Western countries have begun to realize that the policy of artificially restricting trade with socialist countries is unworkable.

The Soviet government believes that in order to promote international economic cooperation, it would be beneficial to convene a conference of representatives with the participation of all relevant countries. At this world economic conference, consultations can be held on the establishment of a permanent body to manage trade issues within the framework of the United Nations.

The head of the Soviet delegation finally pointed out that in order to enhance the role of the United Nations in deciding the most important international issues, it is necessary to abandon the attempt to turn the United Nations into a political tool of one country or certain countries, and it is necessary to strive to strengthen the United Nations and enhance the prestige and role of the United Nations institutions, rather than weaken the United Nations by establishing various blocs and military alliances. He pointed out that it is necessary to solve the problem of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, a problem that should have been solved long ago. The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 21st: According to TASS, the head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, wrote to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on September 20th, requesting that the two issues of "Declaration on Peaceful Coexistence among States" and "Cessation of Testing of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons under International Supervision" be included in the agenda of the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly as important and urgent separate items. Attached to the letter were explanatory notes explaining the reasons for raising these two issues, as well as draft resolutions.

### 苏联提出缓和国际紧张局势建议  要求联大讨论和平共处宣言和裁军问题  再次主张美英法苏不得在中东使用武力

    苏联提出缓和国际紧张局势建议
    要求联大讨论和平共处宣言和裁军问题
    再次主张美英法苏不得在中东使用武力
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约20日讯：出席联合国大会第十二届会议的苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯在9月20日的会议上发言。葛罗米柯同时向大会提出了关于各国和平共处的宣言草案、关于在国际监督下停止试验核武器两年到三年的决议草案、关于各国承担不使用原子武器义务的决议草案以及苏联政府关于局部裁军措施的备忘录。
    葛罗米柯在发言中指出，整个国际局势仍然动荡不安。他指责北大西洋集团奉行的“冷战”政策。现在，世界仍然被分成互相敌对的军事集团，进行着从来还没有过的那种军备竞赛，特别危险的是，主要是在生产原子武器和氢武器方面进行军备竞赛。
    葛罗米柯说，现在人类面前有两条道路：一条是持久和平，各个国家不问彼此的社会制度和思想意识如何而大家进行合作；另一条是原子战争，或者从最好的情况来说，也是忧心忡忡地等着原子战争的爆发和进行着破坏性的、吞没了越来越多的人力和物力的军备竞赛。
    葛罗米柯说，为了进一步扩大国际合作和缓和国际紧张局势，苏联代表团把关于各国和平共处原则的宣言草案提交大会讨论。
    宣言草案中号召各国用和平方法解决国际间的任何争端，并且号召各国在相互关系上遵循下列原则：
    一，互相尊重领土、主权完整；
    二，互不侵犯；
    三，不因某种经济、政治或思想意识上的理由而互相干涉内政；
    四，平等互利；
    五，和平共处。
    葛罗米柯随后谈到裁军问题。他指出，裁军小组委员会的情况是十分不正常的。造成这种不正常情况的原因是西方国家不愿意采纳苏联所提出的裁军建议，尽管苏联政府在许多有争执的问题上已经对其他参加谈判的国家作了很多的让步。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，苏联是主张彻底解决裁军问题的，它主张大大裁减武装部队、军备和军费，主张完全地、无条件地禁止使用与制造原子武器和氢武器，以及销毁现有的原子武器和氢武器。
    由于考虑到西方国家的立场，并为打开裁军问题的僵局起见，苏联政府在裁军问题上提出了实行一系列局部措施的建议。
    葛罗米柯接着谈到了苏联政府提出的关于美国、苏联、英国和法国分三阶段裁减武装部队和把常规军备裁减15％的建议，关于放弃使用各种类型的原子武器和氢武器以及撤除设在别国领土的军事基地的建议等等。
    苏联代表将苏联政府关于局部裁军措施的备忘录提交大会讨论。备忘录中包含了苏联的各项基本建议。
    葛罗米柯还提出了关于各国承担不使用原子武器义务的决议草案。苏联政府建议，拥有核武器的国家先承担在五年内不使用原子武器和氢武器的义务。假使在这期间仍没有缔结广泛的裁军协定，那么五年之后可以重新来讨论这个义务问题。苏联政府认为，这个问题必须单独加以研究，不把它同其它裁军问题纠缠在一起。
    葛罗米柯接着说，停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题也应当作为一个单独问题来讨论并且立即签订有关的协定。这样就会消除放射性微粒及原子辐射危害人类健康的危险，就会阻止原子武器和氢武器的生产竞赛，就会防止毁灭性更大的新型武器的出现，而这一类新式武器正是依靠进行试验来检验它们的性能的。这样就会在走向主要目标——完全地无条件地禁止原子武器和氢武器的道路上迈出实际的第一步。
    苏联代表所提出的关于在国际监督下停止试验核武器两年到三年的决议草案中规定：从1958年1月1日起开始在两、三年内停止核武器试验；成立国际委员会，进行监督，国际委员会将向安全理事会和联合国大会提出报告；在对等的基础上，在苏联、美国、英国境内以及英国领地和包括澳大利亚在内的太平洋地区建立监督岗。
    葛罗米柯指出，联合国裁军小组委员会的成员少，代表性小，这是妨碍达成裁军协议的原因之一。整个亚洲和非洲在这个机构里就没有自己的代表，而且这个机构的五个成员国之中有四个是北大西洋军事集团的成员，而这个集团恰恰就是扩张军备的急先锋。
    葛罗米柯说，扩大裁军委员会和裁军小组委员会的成员，吸收反对“冷战”政策、实行和平共处政策而且自然也关心裁军问题的国家的代表加入这些机构的必要性早已成熟了。苏联政府主张，裁军谈判应在公开的情况下进行。那种谈判的秘密性质显然是赞成“冷战”的人所要的。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联将竭尽一切努力，争取尽速就裁军问题达成协议，同时，也愿意明确地宣布，只要美国、英国和北大西洋集团其他成员国仍旧拒绝缔结裁军协定，拒绝禁止原子武器和氢武器，拒绝停止原子弹和氢弹的试验，只要它们继续加强自己的武装部队的战斗实力，那末苏联就要采取一切必要的措施，可靠地保障本国的安全，并同自己的盟国、包括同防御性的华沙条约的盟国密切配合实行这些措施。
    葛罗米柯在谈到中近东地区局势时说，联合国大会不能不注意这个地区仍旧紧张的局势。造成这种情况的主要原因就是北大西洋集团国家，特别是美国，不断地干涉该地区国家的内政。有人对叙利亚采取了粗暴的政治压力和经济压力，在策划反对叙利亚政府的阴谋，而在最近对叙利亚又越来越经常地以直接军事干涉相威胁。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联对于在中近东的挑衅活动，对这一地区紧张局势的加深不能漠不关心，因为这危及到它本身的安全。
    葛罗米柯再次提到苏联提出的建议：美国、英国、法国和苏联四国政府不得在中近东地区使用武力，不得对这个地区国家的内政有任何干涉。联大如果能以某种形式支持这些原则，这种支持就会在改进中近东局势方面起重大的作用。
    接着，他重申苏联政府提出的关于北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约组织成员国缔结一项条约，以使他们承担不使用武力和通过和平途径来解决一切争端问题的义务。
    他说，苏联方面愿意把它根据华沙条约和其他国际协定目前驻在国外的军队撤回，只要美国和其他西方国家也把它们驻在欧洲国家领土上的武装部队撤回。苏联政府认为，驻在其他一些国家境内的外国军队也应撤出，这些军队现在还以某种借口驻在那里。
    葛罗米柯然后谈到必须保证广泛而自由的国际经济往来的问题。他说，看来，许多西方国家已经开始认识到人为地限制同社会主义国家贸易的政策是行不通的。
    苏联政府认为，为了促进国际经济合作，召开一次有一切有关国家参加的代表会议是有益的。在这种世界经济会议上，可以对于在联合国的范围内成立一个管理贸易问题的常设机构一事进行协商。
    苏联代表团团长最后指出，为了提高联合国在决定最重大的国际问题方面的作用，必须抛弃这样一种企图：把联合国变成一个国家或某些国家的政治工具，必须竭力加强联合国，提高联合国机构的威信和作用，而不是用建立各种集团和军事联盟的方法来削弱联合国。他指出：必须解决像恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利这样一个早就必须解决的问题。中华人民共和国政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府。
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯9月20日写信给联合国大会主席，要求把“各国和平共处的宣言”和“在国际监督下停止试验原子武器和氢武器”两个问题分别作为重要而紧急的单独项目列入联合国大会第十二届会议的议程。随信并附着解释提出这两个问题的原因的说明书以及决议草案。
