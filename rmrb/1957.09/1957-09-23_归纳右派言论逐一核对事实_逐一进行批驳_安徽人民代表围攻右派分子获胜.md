    Anhui People's Representatives Victoriously Besiege Rightist Elements
    (Our dispatch from Hefei, 22nd) At the recent fourth session of the First Anhui Provincial People's Congress, the representatives waged a fierce struggle against Rightist elements. These Rightist elements were Chen Rengang, Li Xiangruo, Dai Yue, Cheng Shifan, Li Zegang, Zhang Dongye, Zhang Jie, Yu Likui, Pan E'zhang, Shi Yuangao, Du Zhonghe, Ma Yichen, Zhang Lizhi, Zhang Kuan, Wang Xinyi, Chen Ciquan, Yang Subing, Rong Dexin, and Huang Mengfei. In order to support the just struggle of the People's Representatives, the people from all over the province wrote letters and sent representatives to expose the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of the Rightist elements, forming a joint force inside and outside the meeting to encircle and annihilate the Rightist elements. In the face of truth, the Rightist elements were rendered speechless and had no choice but to bow their heads to the people and confess their crimes.
    Zhang Dongye, Standing Committee member of the Anhui Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Deputy Mayor of Hefei, and a Rightist element, confessed that he admired the reactionary remarks of Zhang Bojun and Ge Peiqi because he also hated the Communist Party. He admitted that the anti-Party clique he organized with Rightist elements such as Liu Bingjun and Jin Xiaozhang aimed to overthrow the socialist system and restore capitalism in China. The organizational line was "to use the China Democratic National Construction Association as a base, backward elements as the backbone, win over the middle ground, attack the active, and gradually expand the anti-Party forces." The steps for attacking the Party were "demonstration at the upper level, influence at the middle level, and full bloom at the lower level." Rightist element Dai Yue (Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Secretary of the Party Group of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles) confessed to his criminal activities of directing the anti-Party clique of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to attack the Party before and after the blooming. Pan E'zhang, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and a Rightist element, admitted that "in the early days of the blooming, he indeed had thoughts of changing the dynasty," and had "resonance" in his heart for Zhang Naiqi's anti-Communist remarks, acting as a "wholesaler" of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks in Anhui. Cheng Shifan, a deputy to the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Provincial Science and Technology Association, confessed that the purpose of his anti-Communist activities "was to seize the Party's leadership over scientific work in Anhui," handed over the list of members of the anti-Communist clique, and admitted that this clique was his "political capital." Rightist element Zhang Jie (member of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture) had slandered activists during the blooming as "nitpicking," "looking for bones in eggs," and "building their happiness on the suffering of others." At this meeting, the representatives presented a large number of facts to debate with him, and he was rendered speechless and admitted that he was fabricating rumors and slanders. Rightist element Li Zegang (alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Culture, Director of the Provincial Museum) not only attacked the Party during the blooming, but also concealed his reactionary status as a pseudo-Pacification Committee member, and even denied it in front of the People's Representatives. However, when the representatives presented materials such as the Kuomintang archives for verification, he had no choice but to lower his head and admit it. The representatives launched a debate with Rightist element Zhang Lizhi (Chairman of the Bengbu Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Chairman of the Municipal China Democratic National Construction Association, Deputy Mayor) on the following three questions: Is the imperialist economic system good, or is the socialist economic system good? Are capitalists good, or are public representatives good? Do bourgeois elements still need to continue to reform? Under the reasonable and forceful refutations and exposures of the representatives, Zhang Lizhi could no longer argue and had to confess his anti-Communist motives. In addition, the representatives sent by the judicial systems of various regions also exposed Chen Rengang's many crimes of being lenient towards counter-revolutionaries in the judicial field.
    The representatives adopted the "clearing segment by segment" method of struggle in their struggle against the Rightist elements, that is, summarizing the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of the Rightist elements into several questions, verifying the facts one by one, and refuting them one by one, so that the Rightist elements had no choice but to bow their heads and confess their crimes in the face of conclusive facts and sufficient reasons.

    归纳右派言论逐一核对事实　逐一进行批驳
    安徽人民代表围攻右派分子获胜
    本报合肥22日电　在最近举行的安徽省第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，代表们对右派分子进行了猛烈的斗争。这些右派分子是陈仁刚、李湘若、戴岳、程士范、李则纲、张东野、张节、余立奎、潘锷鏱、石原皋、杜仲和、马轶尘、张立之、张宽、王心仪、陈次权、杨素冰、荣德馨、黄梦飞。全省各地人民为了支援人民代表的正义斗争，纷纷写信、派代表来揭发右派分子的反共反社会主义言行，形成了会内会外合力对右派分子的围歼。右派分子在真理面前理屈词穷，不得不纷纷向人民低头认罪。
    民建安徽省工委会常委、合肥市副市长、右派分子张东野在交代中说他欣赏章伯钧、葛佩琦的反动言论是因为他也恨共产党，他承认和右派分子刘秉钧、金孝章等组织的反党小集团是以推翻社会主义制度、使资本主义在中国复辟为目的；组织路线是“以民建为基地，以落后分子为骨干，拉拢中间，打击积极，逐步扩大反党力量”；向党进攻的步骤是“上层示范、中层影响、下层全面开花”。右派分子戴岳（省委宣传部副部长、省文联党组书记）交代了他在鸣放前后指挥文联反党小集团向党进攻的罪恶活动。省工商联主任委员、右派分子潘锷鏱承认“在鸣放初期，确有变天思想”，内心里对章乃器的反共言论有“共鸣”，作了章乃器反动言论在安徽的“批发商”。全国人民代表大会代表、省科联主席程士范交代了他反共活动的目的“是想夺取党对安徽科学工作的领导权”，交出了反共小集团成员名单，并承认这个小集团是他的“政治资本”。右派分子张节（民革安徽省委委员、省农业厅副厅长）在鸣放中曾诬蔑积极分子是“吹毛求疵”，“鸡蛋里找骨头”，“把自己的幸福建立在别人的痛苦上”。这次会议中代表们拿出了大量事实来同他辩论，他理屈词穷，承认他是造谣诬蔑。右派分子李则纲（民盟中央候补委员、省文化局副局长、省博物馆长）除了在鸣放中向党进攻外，还一直隐瞒了他的伪戡乱委员等反动身份，甚至在人民代表面前还要否认，但当代表们拿出国民党的档案等材料来对证时，他不得不低头承认。代表们同右派分子张立之（蚌埠市工商联主委、市民建副主委、副市长）在下面三个问题上展开了论战：帝国主义经济制度好，还是社会主义经济制度好？资本家好还是公方代表好？资产阶级分子还要不要继续改造？张立之在代表们的有理有力的驳斥和揭发下，无法再辩，不得不交代其反共目的。此外各地司法系统派来的代表还揭发了陈仁刚在司法方面宽容反革命的不少罪行。
    代表们同右派分子的斗争采取了“段段清”的斗争方法，即将右派分子的反共反社会主义言行归纳成几个问题，逐一核对事实，逐一进行驳斥，使右派分子在确凿的事实和充分的理由面前不得不低头认罪。
