    He Receives Praise from Commune Members
    Han Dinggang
    Yu Qixing is a student in the Law Department of Peking University. His home is in Ningyi Advanced Cooperative in Ningxie Township, Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province. This time, his love of labor has won the praise of the masses.
    After Yu Qixing arrived home, he went to the fields and worked with the commune members to pump water for drought resistance, harvest rice, and weed the fields. Under the hot sun, he was covered in sweat. The commune members advised him to take a break, but he replied without hesitation, "It's good for me to get some exercise in the sun like this." People who knew him passed by the field and asked him, "Are you sure you, a university student, can handle agricultural labor?" He said, "At the university, I'm a university student, but in the countryside, I have to be a farmer."
    In addition to continuously participating in field labor, Yu Qixing also carried out various policy publicity activities in the village, and helped with the cooperative's work, becoming a popular propagandist and a hard-working cooperative cadre. When he first arrived at the cooperative, he found that the commune members' thinking was somewhat wavering, so he took the initiative to report the situation to the Party organization. Under the leadership and support of the general branch, he analyzed the situation with the cooperative's cadres, found the cause of the confusion, and convened meetings of cooperative cadres and members. Using recollection and comparison, and careful accounting, he affirmed that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain was a life-saving policy, and that the collectivization policy was the fundamental policy for the vast number of peasants to move towards common prosperity. He also analyzed some of the difficulties that might be encountered in building socialism, and severely criticized the various reactionary fallacies and crimes of the right-wing elements, which raised the masses' awareness, clarified the confused thinking, clarified right and wrong, and found the direction. Everyone said, "Qixing's meetings are really well-organized and easy to understand."
    He also helped the cooperative to sort out farm tools, do some odd jobs, and after working for several days, the cooperative wanted to give him work points. He said, "Why should such light labor be given work points?"
    Yu Qixing's various actions have been praised by the local people. The cadres and masses in the cooperative said that in the past, college students always looked down their noses when they returned home. Qixing, on the other hand, has always been simple and unpretentious, hardworking and enduring. This is truly the result of the Communist Party's good education.

    他受到社员的赞扬
    韩定纲
    余齐兴是北京大学法律系的学生，他的家在浙江省天台县宁协乡宁益高级社。这次他热爱劳动的行为，受到了群众的赞扬。
    余齐兴到家后，就下田与社员们一起，车水抗旱、割稻、耘田。在炎热的太阳下，他被晒得浑身流汗，社员们劝他休息休息，他却毫不在意地答道，我这样在太阳底下，锻炼锻炼也有好处。熟悉他的人路过田边问他，“你是个大学生，参加农业劳动行吗？”他说，“在大学里做大学生，到农村就得做农民”。
    余齐兴除了不间断地参加田间劳动外，还在村中进行各项政策的宣传，又帮助社里工作，成为群众爱戴的宣传员和不辞辛劳的社干部。当他刚到社里时，发现社员思想有些波动，他就主动向党组织汇报了情况，在总支的领导与支持下，和社内干部一起，分析了情况，找出了混乱的原因，召开了社干部、社员等会议，用回忆对比，算细帐，肯定了粮食统购统销政策是救命政策，合作化政策是广大农民走向共同富裕的根本政策，并分析了建设社会主义可能碰到的一些困难，严厉地批驳了右派分子的各种反动谬论和罪行，使群众提高了觉悟，澄清了混乱思想，明确了是非，找到了方向。大家都说，“齐兴的会开得真使人听得有条有理。”
    他还帮助社里整理农具，做些杂活，搞了好几天，社里要给他记工分。他说，这样轻微的劳动，还要记什么工分？
    余齐兴的各种举动，当地的人们无不赞扬。社里的干部和群众都说，过去的大学生回家，总是眼睛朝天。齐兴却始终是简单朴素，刻苦耐劳。这真是共产党教导得好。
