Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 21st. More than 220,000 rural Communist Party members in Hubei Province actively participated in the rectification study. Through extensive debates, they rigorously examined and criticized right-leaning ideology and capitalist ideology, as well as certain shortcomings or errors in their work style, thereby enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses.

The rectification of rural Party members in Hubei Province was conducted in batches and by township under the direct leadership of the CCP County Committees. This rectification centered on major debates concerning issues such as the unified purchase and sale of grain, agricultural collectivization, the worker-peasant alliance, and urban-rural relations. In this great debate, the vast majority of Party members used methods such as recollections, comparisons, and accounting to powerfully demonstrate the great achievements of socialist transformation and construction through vivid facts based on personal experiences. They criticized the right-leaning ideology and capitalist ideology of some Party members and clearly demarcated the line between right and wrong on major issues.

In Wugou Township, Mianyang County, the vast majority of Party members supported the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain during the rectification. Only a few individuals viewed the issue from a capitalist standpoint, saying that the unified purchase and sale of grain left farmers with insufficient food. Hu Qunlin, a Communist Party member and director of a cooperative, refuted the claim of insufficient rations using materials from a survey of the actual grain consumption of fifteen peasant households. Among the fifteen households, the five well-off peasant households consumed 590 jin of grain per person in 1948 and 676 jin per person in 1956; the remaining ten peasant households consumed 398 jin of grain per person in 1948 and 646 jin per person in 1956. Grain consumption for these fifteen households after the unified purchase and sale was not insufficient, but rather surplus. Communist Party members in Huanglong Township, Zhuxi County, denounced during the rectification that after suffering from a flood in 1939, grain was in the hands of landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, resulting in a tragic situation where people ate people and one hundred people starved to death. However, after suffering from a flood last year, the government traversed mountains and ridges to transport more than 200,000 jin of grain from Henan Province. The transportation cost and cost price was 1.3 yuan per jin, but it was sold to farmers for only 0.75 yuan per jin. After comparing these facts, the system of unified purchase and sale of grain was consolidated in the minds of Party members, and no one could shake it.

After the rectification, Communist Party members in Mashan, Zhuji, and Hongqi Townships in Jiangling County consciously confessed their past mistakes of concealing land and underreporting production to deceive the state, and wrote letters to the County Committee to make self-criticisms. In Huanggang Prefecture, 3,463 Communist Party members in 38 townships, combined with the discussion of the transformation of Liu Jiemei's thinking during the rectification, strictly examined and criticized their own individualism, departmentalism, and capitalist ideology, greatly enhancing their socialist consciousness. The vast majority of rural Party members in the province actively participated in the rectification, which not only further armed themselves politically and ideologically, but also gained experience in leading the entire rural population to participate in the socialist great debate from the rectification movement.

During this rectification movement, the vast majority of Party members sincerely conducted self-criticisms and made improvements regarding certain shortcomings or errors in their work that were exposed in the past. Now, all rural Party members are in high spirits and have confidently thrown themselves into the current struggle against drought to ensure a good harvest, grain purchase, and socialist education. Yingshan County was severely threatened by the autumn drought. Amidst the intense rectification movement, all Communist Party members immediately organized 40,000 laborers and more than 2,500 waterwheels in a fighting posture to engage in the anti-drought struggle. Xiong Zongyi, the Party branch secretary of the Sanming Township Democratic Agricultural Cooperative, did not go deep into production in the past. As soon as the rectification study ended, he went deep into the teams to participate in production, understand the situation, and found that the cooperative did not have enough *bianzi* (rope made from straw) for bundling grain. He used the time during meetings to make more than 500 *dan* of *bianzi*. The cooperative members praised him, saying that the Party branch secretary had changed after the study. (Attached picture)

    湖北二十多万农村党员战斗力增强
    本报讯　湖北省二十二万多农村共产党员积极参加了整风学习，通过大辩论，严格地检查和批判了右倾思想和资本主义思想以及工作上作风上的某些缺点或错误，从而增强了党的战斗力，密切了党和群众的关系。
    湖北省农村党员的整风是分片分乡在中共县委直接领导下进行的。这次整风都围绕粮食统购统销、农业合作化、工农联盟和城乡关系等问题开展了大辩论。在这场大辩论中，广大党员用回忆、对比、算账等方式，用亲身经历的生动事实，强有力地证明了社会主义改造和建设事业的伟大成就，批判了某些党员的右倾思想和资本主义思想，划清了大是大非的界限。
    沔阳县挖沟乡全体党员在整风中，绝大部分人拥护粮食统购统销政策，只有个别人从资本主义立场上看问题，说粮食统购统销整的农民粮食不够吃。共产党员、共同社主任胡群林用调查十五户农民实用粮的材料，驳倒了口粮不够吃的说法。十五户农民中的五户富裕农民，1948年每人用粮五百九十斤，1956年每人用粮六百七十六斤；其余十户农民1948年每人用粮三百九十八斤，1956年每人用粮六百四十六斤。这十五户农民在统购统销后的用粮不是不够，而是有余。竹溪县黄龙乡共产党员在整风中控诉：1939年遭受水灾后，粮食掌握在地主、富农和资本家手里，造成人吃人和饿死一百个人的惨局。但是去年遭受水灾后，政府翻过丛山峻岭从河南省运来二十多万斤粮食，运费和成本要一角三分钱一斤，只按七分五一斤卖给农民。对比这些事实后，粮食统购统销制度在党员的思想中巩固起来了，谁也动摇不了。
    江陵县马山、朱集、红旗等乡共产党员经过整风后，自觉地交代了过去瞒田瞒产欺骗国家的错误行为，并写信向县委作了检讨。黄冈专区三十八个乡三千四百六十三名共产党员，在整风中结合对刘介梅思想的转变的讨论，严格检查和批判了自己的个人主义、本位主义和资本主义思想，大大提高了社会主义觉悟。全省广大农村党员积极参加整风，不仅进一步从政治上思想上武装了自己，也从整风运动中取得了领导全体农村人口参加社会主义大辩论的经验。
    在这次整风运动中，广大党员对所揭发出来的过去工作上的某些缺点或错误，诚恳地进行了检查和改进。现在，全体农村党员情绪饱满，满怀信心地投入了当前的抗旱保收斗争、粮食征购和社会主义教育等工作。应山县受到了严重的秋旱威胁，全体共产党员在紧张的整风运动中，以战斗的姿态立即组织了四万个劳动力、二千五百多辆水车投入抗旱斗争。三明乡民主农业社党支部书记熊宗义过去领导生产不深入，整风学习一结束，就深入到各队参加生产，了解情况，发现社里捆谷的?子不够用后，他就利用开会的时间打了五百多担?子，社员们都称赞说，党支部书记经过学习变了样了。（附图片）
