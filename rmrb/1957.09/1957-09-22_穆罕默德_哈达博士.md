    Dr. Mohammad Hatta, former Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, was born in Bukittinggi, Sumatra Island, on August 12, 1902. He studied at Jakarta High School and the Netherlands School of Economics in Rotterdam. During his studies in the Netherlands, he joined the "Indonesian Association" which aimed at fighting for Indonesian independence, and served as the chairman of the association from 1926 to 1930.
    In 1932, Dr. Hatta returned to his motherland. At that time, the Nationalist Party led by Sukarno was forced to disband, and Sukarno was arrested and imprisoned. Dr. Hatta led the "Indonesian National Education Association" to continue the struggle against the rule of the Dutch East Indies government. In 1934, he was arrested by the Dutch colonial authorities, and the following year he was exiled to West Irian Island, and later transferred to Banda Neira and Sukabumi. In March 1942, he was released by the Japanese army that invaded the south. In 1945, before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, representatives from various regions of Indonesia organized the "Indonesian Independence Preparation Committee," with Sukarno and Hatta serving as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee, respectively.
    After the Japanese surrender, Sukarno and Hatta jointly signed the Indonesian Declaration of Independence on August 17, 1945, declaring Indonesian independence to the world. On the 18th of the same month, he was elected Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia. Since then, although Dr. Hatta served as Prime Minister of the Cabinet three times, his position as Vice President remained unchanged.
    In January 1948, Dr. Hatta served as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of the Second Presidential Cabinet. On December 19 of the same year, after the Dutch invading army launched the second "police action," he, Sukarno, Sjahrir and others were captured and imprisoned in Bangka, and were not released until July of the following year.
    On August 4, 1949, he formed the Third Presidential Cabinet and served as Prime Minister. On December 19, 1949, Hatta served as Prime Minister of the National Affairs Cabinet of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.
    On August 15, 1950, President Sukarno announced the official establishment of the unified Republic of Indonesia. The federal republic, which had been artificially divided into many states, became a unified republic at this time. Dr. Hatta continued to serve as Vice President. On December 1, 1956, he resigned from his position as Vice President.
    Dr. Hatta has many works, including "Greek Thought", "Introduction to Science and Knowledge" and other books, as well as important papers such as "Sociology", "The Scope of Economics", "Theory and Practice" and "Learning Economics". (According to Xinhua News Agency draft) (Attached picture)
