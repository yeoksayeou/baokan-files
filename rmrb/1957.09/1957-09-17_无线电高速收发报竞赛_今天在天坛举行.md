Radio High-Speed Telegraphy Competition
To Be Held at the Temple of Heaven Today

　　This newspaper reports that the 1957 National Radio High-Speed Telegraphy Competition is scheduled to be held at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing from September 17th to 23rd. This is the first time a national radio competition has been held in China.
　　Participating in this competition are representative teams from seven units, including the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Xinhua News Agency, the Meteorological Bureau, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and the Civil Aviation Administration of China, with a total of forty-two members (six members per team). Many of these team members participated in the International Radio Rapid Telegraphy Competition held in Czechoslovakia in November 1956 and achieved excellent results (in that competition, the Chinese delegation won first place in the overall score with a score of 5,227.63). For example, Wang Zuyan of the Xinhua News Agency delegation won the men's typewriter copying championship, and Wei Shixian of the Meteorological Bureau delegation won second place in the women's hand copying machine competition. Wang Zuyan and Wei Shixian also set a world record in that competition by copying long codes at a rate of 440 characters per minute. The PLA delegation participating in this competition is a strong team selected through an army-wide competition, including outstanding telegraphers Ge Qiao and Huang Mingyi.
