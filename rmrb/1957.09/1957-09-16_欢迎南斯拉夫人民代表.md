　　Our people's unity and cooperation with socialist countries are developing and consolidating day by day, and our friendly exchanges with people from all over the world are also increasing with the passage of time. As the National Day is approaching, friends from countries far and near are arriving one after another to visit our country. Just a few days ago, we welcomed Comrade Vukmanović, Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, and today, we once again joyfully receive guests from the Adriatic coast in the capital—the delegation of the Federal National Assembly of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, headed by Comrade Stambolić.
　　The visit of the Yugoslav parliamentary delegation is a sign of further development in the friendly exchanges and mutual relations between China and Yugoslavia. In recent years, our two countries have exchanged delegations of trade unions, women, youth, journalists, legal workers, military personnel, and agriculture. Artists and athletes from both countries have also conducted mutual visits, performances, and friendly competitions. Trade agreements have been signed and scientific and technological cooperation has been established between our two countries. It is particularly worth mentioning the visit to Yugoslavia in January this year by the delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, headed by Comrade Peng Zhen. During their stay of more than ten days, the two delegations from our country visited some important cities in Yugoslavia, and toured factories, rural areas, cultural facilities, and social institutions. The leaders of Yugoslavia and people from all walks of life expressed warm welcome and deep friendship to our delegations. Through this visit, mutual understanding and friendly relations between China and Yugoslavia have been further strengthened.
　　The Yugoslav people are people who love freedom and have experienced severe war trials. During World War II, the Yugoslav people's heroic struggle against fascist aggression won the sympathy and praise of the people of Europe and the world. After the war, Yugoslavia embarked on the path of socialist development. Over the years, the Yugoslav people have made important achievements in socialist construction. In 1956, the value of Yugoslavia's industrial production had increased more than two and a half times compared to the pre-war period. The proportion of industry in Yugoslavia's total national income has increased from 27% before the war to 45.6%. Due to the establishment of some heavy industry production sectors that did not exist before the war and the development of the entire industry, Yugoslavia has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country. Although the development of agriculture in Yugoslavia lags behind industry, the Yugoslav government has recently decided to take a series of measures to increase agricultural production by developing cooperation and improving the level of mechanization. The living standards of the Yugoslav people have also exceeded the pre-war level. In Yugoslavia's industrial and mining production and transportation sectors, the capitalist relations of production that hindered the development of productive forces, namely the private ownership of the means of production, no longer exist. These are all favorable conditions for the further development of the Yugoslav economy. We wish the Yugoslav people greater achievements in developing the economy and building socialism.
　　The Yugoslav parliamentary delegation's visit to our country will provide an opportunity to learn about the socialist construction in various urban and rural areas of our country and the general social situation in our country. They will not only bring the friendship of the Yugoslav people to the people of our country, but will also bring the friendship of the people of our country to the Yugoslav people after their visit. Through this exchange of friendship and increased mutual understanding, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples will inevitably continue to develop and strengthen, and at the same time will enhance the unity of the people of socialist countries and the cause of international cooperation as a whole.

　　欢迎南斯拉夫人民代表
    我国人民同社会主义各国的团结合作正在一天比一天发展巩固，我们同世界各国人民的友好往来也随着时间的推移而日见增进。在这国庆佳节就要来临的日子里，来自远近各国的朋友们正在接踵而来访问我国。仅仅在几天之前我们欢迎了南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇同志，而今天，我们又在首都再一次愉快地接待从亚得里亚海畔远道前来的客人——以斯坦鲍利奇同志为首的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国联邦国民议会代表团。
    南斯拉夫议会代表团的来访，是中南两国人民友好往来和相互关系进一步发展的标志。近年来，我们两国曾经交换了工会、妇女、青年、新闻工作者、法律工作者、军事和农业等代表团。两国的艺术家和运动员也相互进行了访问演出和友谊比赛。在我们两国之间已经签订了贸易协定并建立了科学技术方面的合作。特别值得指出的是，今年1月间以彭真同志为首的我全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团对南斯拉夫的访问。在十多天的逗留期间，我国的这两个代表团访问了南斯拉夫的一些重要城市，参观了工厂、农村、文化设施和社会机构。南斯拉夫的领导同志们和各界人士对我国代表团表示了热烈的欢迎和深厚的友谊。通过这次访问，进一步加强了中南两国之间的相互了解和友好关系。
    南斯拉夫人民是酷爱自由并经历过严重战争考验的人民。在第二次世界大战中，南斯拉夫人民反抗法西斯侵略的英勇斗争，曾经博得了欧洲与世界各国人民的同情和赞扬。战后，南斯拉夫走上了社会主义发展的道路。这些年来南斯拉夫人民在社会主义建设中已经取得了重要的成就。1956年南斯拉夫的工业生产价值已比战前增加了二倍半以上。在南斯拉夫的整个国民收入中，工业所占的比重已从战前的27％增长为45.6％。由于一些战前所没有的重工业生产部门的建立和整个工业的发展，南斯拉夫已由一个落后的农业国家转变成为一个工业—农业国了。虽然南斯拉夫农业的发展落后于工业，但是最近南斯拉夫政府已经决定采取一系列的措施，以便通过发展合作化和提高机械化程度的方法来增加农业生产量。南斯拉夫人民的生活水平也已超过了战前。在南斯拉夫的工矿生产和交通运输部门，束缚生产力发展的资本主义的生产关系，即生产资料的私有制也已不复存在。这些都是南斯拉夫经济进一步发展的有利条件。我们祝南斯拉夫人民在发展经济和建设社会主义的事业中获得更大的成就。
    南斯拉夫议会代表团这次来访我国，将有机会了解我国城乡各地的社会主义建设和我国的一般社会情况。他们不但将带来南斯拉夫人民对我国人民的友谊，同时也将在访问以后把我国人民的友谊带给南斯拉夫人民。经过这种友谊的交流和相互了解的增进，我们两国人民之间的友好合作关系就必然会不断地发展和加强起来，同时也会增进社会主义各国人民之间的团结和整个国际合作的事业。
