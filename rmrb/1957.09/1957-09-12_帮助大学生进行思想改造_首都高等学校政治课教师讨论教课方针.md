Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Party Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for Higher Education held a ten-day study session for political course teachers in capital universities from August 27th to September 6th. This study session helped political course teachers in universities further clarify how to offer socialist ideological education courses in the next academic year.

More than 200 people attended the study session, including responsible cadres from political teaching and research departments of universities in the capital, propaganda cadres from the school party committees, and some political course teachers. Prior to this, they had all listened to reports by Lu Dingyi and Kang Sheng at the Beijing Marxist-Leninist Teachers' Reporting Conference. This time, they also listened to reports by Jiang Nanxiang, Deng Tuo, Hu Sheng, Xu Liqun, Tian Jiaying, Yu Guangyuan, Yao Zhen, Yang Shu, and others. These reports, in connection with the specific situation of the anti-rightist struggle in universities in the capital, systematically analyzed the reactionary nature of the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist fallacies of the rightists and the class basis of these fallacies, focusing on democracy and centralism, people's democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat, the leadership of the Communist Party, class stand, internationalism and nationalism, bourgeois individualism and liberalism, opposition to absolute egalitarianism, and some issues in socialist construction. The teachers discussed each report.

During the study process, the teachers focused on discussing and examining how political course teachers should treat the teaching policy of "studying theory, linking with reality, improving understanding, and transforming ideology." During the examination, some people believed that they were not clear about this policy ideologically in the past, and that the term "ideological remolding" was not necessarily applicable to universities. At that time, the reason was that university students were young and simple-minded, and only positive and systematic theoretical education was needed; it was not necessary to help students transform their ideology by connecting with their ideological situation. They believed that the issue of students establishing a communist world outlook could be solved by themselves after they finished studying the theory.

In this discussion, the teachers, in connection with the situation of the anti-rightist struggle, pointed out that this view did not conform to the actual situation. Eighty percent of the students in universities in the capital came from landlord, bourgeois, or petty-bourgeois families, and the ideology of the landlords and the bourgeoisie had a great influence on them. These influences had been clearly exposed in the "great blooming and contending." If political courses do not work hard to help students carry out ideological remolding, they will actually turn political courses into empty talk, allowing bourgeois ideology to spread among students. They believed that if political courses do not link theory with reality, and do not launch a socialist debate among students to help them improve their understanding and transform their ideology, but only lecture according to the syllabus, then erroneous ideas cannot be overcome, a communist outlook on life cannot be established, and the purpose of political theory courses cannot be achieved.

In their studies, the teachers also discussed the materials about some political course teachers at Tsinghua University who had become rightists due to their long-term opposition to the teaching policy of linking theory with reality and their adherence to the path of bourgeois individualism. They realized that there was also an irreconcilable struggle between two lines in Marxist-Leninist political courses: one was to overcome bourgeois individualism and follow the Party's policy of linking theory with reality; the other was to follow the path of bourgeois intellectuals, allowing the growth and development of individualistic thought, and embarking on the road of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism. That is to say, political course teachers are also sharply faced with the question of whether to be intellectuals of the working class or intellectuals of the bourgeoisie.

After ten days of study and discussion, the teachers believed that the way this study session was conducted was of great help to them in preparing to carry out socialist ideological education. They planned to return to their schools and first conduct discussions and examinations among all political course teachers on the implementation of the teaching policy of linking theory with reality, so that all political course teachers would understand the meaning and purpose of socialist ideological education. They would change the past teaching method of mechanically moving the syllabus without starting from reality, and make this socialist ideological education a component of the nationwide socialist debate, and carry it out as a mass movement, so as to truly help students clarify some fundamental issues in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

　　帮助大学生进行思想改造
　　首都高等学校政治课教师讨论教课方针
    据新华社11日讯　中共北京市委高等学校党委会从8月27日到9月6日举办了为期十天的首都高等学校政治课教师的学习会。这个学习会帮助高等学校政治课教师们进一步明确了下学年如何开设社会主义思想教育课程。
    参加学习会的有首都各高等学校政治教研室的负责干部、学校党委的宣传干部和一部分政治课教师共二百多人。在这以前，他们都在北京市马列主义教师报告会上听了陆定一、康生的报告。这次，他们又听了蒋南翔、邓拓、胡绳、许立群、田家英、于光远、姚溱、杨述等人的报告。这些报告联系首都高等学校反右派斗争的具体情况，比较系统地分析了右派分子反共反人民反社会主义谬论的反动性和这些谬论的阶级基础，着重对民主和集中、人民民主和无产阶级专政、共产党的领导、阶级立场、国际主义和民族主义、资产阶级个人主义和自由主义、反对绝对平均主义和社会主义建设中的一些问题等，作了详细的阐明。教师们对每一个报告都作了讨论。
    在学习过程中，教师们着重讨论和检查了政治课教师怎样对待“学习理论、联系实际、提高认识、改造思想”的教学方针问题。在检查中有些人认为过去在思想上对这一方针不明确，并且认为思想改造的提法不一定适用于高等学校。那时的理由是：高等学校学生年青，思想单纯，只要正面的系统理论教育就行了，不必联系学生的思想情况帮助学生改造思想。他们认为关于学生树立共产主义世界观问题，可等学生学完理论后自己去解决。
    教师们在这次讨论中，联系了反右派斗争的情况，指出过去这种看法不符合实际情况。首都高等学校学生80％是出身于地主、资产阶级或小资产阶级家庭，地主、资产阶级的思想对他们有很大的影响，这些影响在大鸣大放中已经暴露得很明显。如果政治课不努力帮助学生进行思想改造，实际上就是把政治课变成空谈，听任资产阶级思想在学生中泛滥。他们认为，政治课不做到理论联系实际，不在学生中间展开社会主义大辩论，来帮助学生提高认识、改造思想，而只是按照大纲讲讲课，那么错误思想不可能克服，共产主义人生观不可能树立，政治理论课的目的就达不到。
    教师们在学习中还讨论清华大学一些政治课教师由于长期反对理论联系实际的教学方针、坚持资产阶级个人主义的道路而成为右派分子的情况的材料。他们认识到在马列主义政治课方面也有不可调和的两条路线的斗争：一条是克服资产阶级个人主义，按照党的理论联系实际的方针走；另一条是按照资产阶级知识分子的道路走，听任个人主义的思想滋长发展，而走上反对共产党反对社会主义的道路。也就是说，在政治课教师面前也尖锐地摆着做工人阶级的知识分子，还是做资产阶级的知识分子的问题。
    经过十天的学习和讨论，教师们认为这次学习会的开法，对他们准备开展社会主义思想教育的工作有不少帮助。他们准备回校后，首先在全校的政治课教师中间进行关于贯彻理论联系实际的教学方针的讨论和检查，使所有政治课教师弄通社会主义思想教育的意义和目的。改变过去不从实际出发，机械地搬大纲的教学方法，把这次社会主义思想教育，成为全民性的社会主义大辩论的组成部分，作为一个群众运动来进行，做到切切实实地帮助学生弄清社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的一些根本问题。
