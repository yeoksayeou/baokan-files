Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 13th: According to the Polish Press Agency, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, recently gave an interview to a reporter from the Danish Ritzau News Agency on the issue of international relations in the Baltic Sea region.

Gomulka believes that the people of the Baltic Sea and Scandinavian regions should strive to establish a region in the Baltic Sea and its surroundings where countries with different systems and political orientations can coexist peacefully and constructively. They should seize all opportunities for economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation to resolve common problems, including all issues concerning their economic relations.

He also believes that the countries in this region should jointly take all possible steps to prevent conflicts from occurring in the Baltic Sea and its region. For example, an agreement could be made to renounce the use of force in relations between countries in this region, based on the common security needs of the region itself.

Gomulka said, "We also welcome and are prepared to jointly consider any initiatives that are practically proposed to ease international tensions and for the common security and lasting peace of this region."

Regarding the possibility of enhancing direct cooperation between Poland and Scandinavian countries, Gomulka said that after the war, the relations between Poland and these countries have generally been good. Poland's relations with Finland and Sweden are active. We are eager to further expand economic relations and develop cultural relations with Denmark. We are indeed interested in maintaining the quantity of coal exported to these countries at the highest possible level. We can meet these countries' demand for coal. Gomulka added that, moreover, we are eager to strengthen exchanges with the Nordic countries in culture, science, sports, and other fields. Mutual visits by parliamentary delegations help to understand each other and strengthen mutual relations.

When asked about Poland's attitude towards the recently raised issue of military bases on the Baltic Sea, Gomulka stated that Poland is particularly opposed to West Germany's remilitarization through the rebuilding of its army and navy, and especially strongly opposes the plan to equip West German troops with nuclear weapons. Poland advocates ending the arms race and limiting armaments, and restoring mutual trust. Poland supports the abolition of military bases and the withdrawal of troops stationed on foreign territories, based on appropriate agreements, while establishing a collective security system.

　　波罗的海应成为和平的海
　　哥穆尔卡向丹麦记者发表谈话
　　希望各国扩大经济和文化关系
    新华社华沙13日电  据波兰通讯社报道：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡最近就波罗的海方面的国际关系问题对丹麦的里曹通讯社记者发表了谈话。
    哥穆尔卡认为，波罗的海和斯堪的纳维亚区域的人民应当努力在波罗的海和它的周围建立一个使不同制度和政治方针的国家实行和平和建设性共处的地区。他们应当利用经济、科学和文化合作的一切机会，解决一些共同的问题，其中包括关于他们的经济关系的全部问题。
    他又认为，这个地区的国家还应当共同采取一切可能采取的步骤，来防止在波罗的海和它的区域内发生冲突。例如，可以根据对这一地区本身共同安全的需要的考虑，用协定的形式来宣布在这个地区各国之间的关系中放弃使用武力。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们也欢迎并且准备共同来考虑任何实际上为了国际紧张局势的缓和、为了这一地区的共同安全和持久和平而提出的创议。
    关于增进波兰和斯堪的纳维亚国家的直接合作的可能性，哥穆尔卡说，战后，波兰和这些国家的关系总的说来是好的。波兰同芬兰、瑞典的关系是活跃的。我们迫切希望同丹麦进一步扩大经济关系和发展文化关系。我们确实有兴趣把向这些国家输出的煤的数量保持在尽可能高的水平。我们能够满足这些国家对于煤的需求。哥穆尔卡又说，此外，我们也迫切希望同北方的国家加强文化、科学、体育等方面的交流。互派议会代表团有助于互相了解和密切相互关系。
    记者问到，波兰对最近提出的波罗的海上的军事基地问题采取什么态度，哥穆尔卡表示，波兰特别反对西德重建陆海军备而实现军国主义化，尤其坚决反对用核武器装备西德军队的计划。波兰主张结束军备竞赛和限制军备，恢复相互信任。波兰赞成以适当的协定为基础，在建立集体安全体系的同时，取消军事基地和撤退驻在别国领土上的军队。
