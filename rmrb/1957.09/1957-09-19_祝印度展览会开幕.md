　　Congratulations on the Opening of the Indian Exhibition
    Autumn in Beijing is a beautiful season. Yesterday, the people of the capital warmly welcomed our distinguished guest from afar—Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan. Today, we are again welcoming the opening of the Indian Exhibition with great interest.
    The Indian Exhibition being held in our capital this time is the largest exhibition India has held abroad. The exhibition covers an area of 11,000 square meters, and the exhibits include India's modern industrial products and rich and colorful handicrafts. These exhibits vividly reflect the achievements India has made in developing its domestic industry since its independence, and also reflect the working wisdom of the Indian people and their excellent cultural traditions. This exhibition gives us a good opportunity to better understand India and to learn from the Indian people all the good things they have created in their labor.
    China and India are both countries with a long history, and our ancestors once created a brilliant civilization. It is only in modern times that we have fallen behind. However, after we have freed ourselves from colonial enslavement and achieved independence, we have favorable conditions to redevelop our economy and culture. The people of our two countries are eager for peace and happiness, and we are both working hard to overcome the difficulties left over from history to build our own motherland. This common desire is the solid foundation for mutual cooperation between China and India, and for the possibility of mutual cooperation. In recent years, economic and cultural exchanges between China and India have greatly developed. With the progress of economic construction in China and India, our trade relations will become closer, and the prospects for economic cooperation between us will be exceptionally broad. We believe that the holding of this Indian Exhibition will play an important role in promoting our trade relations and economic cooperation.
    China and India are the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and active supporters of the Bandung Spirit. We have always advocated the extensive development of economic exchanges between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, the promotion of mutual understanding between countries, and the strengthening of international cooperation in all aspects. Doing so is not only beneficial to the economic life of the people of all countries, but also beneficial to the common cause of defending world peace. We believe that holding commodity exhibitions between countries is a positive activity that conforms to the Bandung Spirit. Therefore, we warmly congratulate the success of the Indian Exhibition and congratulate it on bringing new contributions to the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and India, to the mutual understanding between the people of all countries, and to the cause of peace and friendship among the people of all countries.

　　祝印度展览会开幕
    北京的秋天，是美丽的季节。昨天，首都的人民刚刚以盛情厚谊迎接了远道来访的我国贵宾——印度副总统拉达克里希南。今天，我们又在怀着极大的兴趣欢迎印度展览会的开幕。
    这次在我国首都举办的印度展览会，是印度在国外举办的最大一次展览会。展览会所占面积达一万一千平方公尺，展出的产品中包括印度的近代工业品和丰富多采的手工艺品。这些展览品生动地反映了印度独立以后在发展本国工业方面所获得的成就，同时也反映了印度人民的劳动智慧以及他们的优秀的文化传统。这个展览会给了我们一个良好的机会，使我们能够更好地了解印度，并向印度人民学习他们在劳动中所创造的一切美好的东西。
    中印两国都是历史悠久的国家，我们的祖先曾经创造过灿烂的文明，只是在近代我们落后了。但是，在我们摆脱了殖民主义的奴役而取得独立以后，我们就有了重新发展经济和文化的有利条件。我们两国人民都渴望和平，渴望幸福，我们都在努力克服历史上遗留下来的困难，来建设自己的祖国。这种共同的愿望，就是我们中印两国需要互相合作、并且能够互相合作的坚实基础。几年来，中印两国经济文化交流已有很大发展。而随着中印两国经济建设的进展，我们之间的贸易关系将会更加密切，我们之间经济合作的前途将是异常广阔的。我们相信，这次印度展览会的举行，在促进我们之间的贸易关系和经济合作方面将起重要的作用。
    中国和印度是和平共处五项原则的倡导者，是万隆精神的积极支持者。我们一向主张在平等互利的基础上广泛发展各国之间的经济交流，促进各国之间的互相了解，从各个方面来加强国际合作。这样做，不仅有利于各国人民的经济生活，而且有利于保卫世界和平的共同事业。我们认为，各国之间互相举办商品展览会，就是符合万隆精神的一种具有积极意义的活动。因此，我们热烈祝贺印度展览会成功，祝贺它将为中印两国人民的友谊和合作，为各国人民之间的互相了解，为各国人民的和平与友好的事业，带来新的贡献。
