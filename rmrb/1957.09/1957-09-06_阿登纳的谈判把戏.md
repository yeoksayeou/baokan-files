    Adenauer's Negotiation Tricks
    Xi Linsheng
    Since the start of negotiations between the Soviet and West German governments on July 23, they have been interrupted twice, at the end of July and in mid-August. The West German government recalled its delegation leader both times. Subsequently, on August 23, both sides resumed negotiations for the third time, but in less than four days, the West German delegation leader sent a letter to the Soviet delegation leader Semyonov, unreasonably requesting a temporary suspension of the two countries' negotiations, causing the talks to stall again.

    The reason why the talks have been so intermittent and unable to proceed smoothly is entirely due to the West German government's insistence on discussing the "repatriation of German citizens" issue.

    The so-called repatriation of German citizens from Soviet territory is completely fabricated. In fact, the "German citizens" that the West German government demands to be repatriated are people who were arbitrarily declared "German citizens" by the Hitler regime during World War II because they lived in German-occupied areas, as well as certain Soviet citizens of German descent who had long settled or were born in the Soviet Union. These people are Soviet citizens and not German citizens. Therefore, there is no issue of "repatriating German citizens" at all.

    Given that this is the case, what does the West German government mean by repeatedly making a fuss about this fabricated issue in the negotiations?

    This is because Adenauer was essentially forced to hold negotiations with the Soviet government in Moscow. The pressure within West Germany for trade talks with the Soviet Union to improve bilateral relations is increasing. With the election approaching, continuing the passive attitude of the past two years would affect the Adenauer party's election campaign. Negotiating out of necessity, without truly wanting success, they had to find an excuse to make the negotiations nominal. They found the "repatriation of German citizens issue."

    Before the start of negotiations between the Soviet and West German governments, Adenauer wrote to the Soviet government, linking trade negotiations with the "repatriation of German people issue" and using the "repatriation issue" as a prerequisite for conducting trade negotiations. West German Foreign Minister Brentano also stated that West Germany would not sign a trade treaty with the Soviet Union without resolving the "repatriation" issue.

    In the actual negotiations, the West German government delegation deliberately placed the "repatriation of German citizens" issue at the forefront and tried to make it the central content of the talks, even though the negotiations were originally intended to resolve trade and consular relations. This attitude of the West German delegation has already interrupted the Soviet-West German negotiations twice, but it still refuses to change this unreasonable attitude and uses the differences between the two sides on the "repatriation issue" as an excuse to suspend negotiations.

    The Adenauer government's approach in the negotiations shows that it is not sincere in negotiating with the Soviet Union. Its seemingly "willing" to negotiate with the Soviet government at this time, while avoiding formally breaking off the negotiations, is merely a pre-election trick to cover up its obstruction of improved East-West relations, while stirring up chauvinistic sentiments to benefit the Adenauer party in the election.

    阿登纳的谈判把戏
    席林生
    苏联和西德政府的会谈从7月23日开始以来，曾经在7月底和8月中旬两度中断，西德政府二次召回了它的政府代表团团长。接着到8月23日双方第三次恢复谈判，但是不到四天，西德政府代表团团长致函苏联代表团团长谢苗诺夫，又无理要求暂时中止两国的谈判，使会谈再度停顿下来。
    会谈所以这样断断续续，不能顺利进行，完全是由于西德政府坚持要讨论“遣返德国公民”问题而造成的。
    所谓遣返苏联境内德国公民的问题完全是无中生有的。事实上，西德政府所要求遣返的“德国公民”，都是一些在第二次大战期间因住在德军占领区而被希特勒政权蛮横地宣布为“德国公民”的人以及某些早已定居或出生在苏联的属于德意志血统的苏联人。这些人是苏联公民而不是什么德国公民。因此根本不存在什么“遣返德国公民”的问题。
    事情既然是这样，那末西德政府在谈判中几次三番在这个杜撰出来的问题上硬做文章又是什么意思呢？
    这是因为阿登纳和苏联政府在莫斯科举行谈判实际上是被迫的。西德国内要求和苏联举行贸易谈判以改善两国关系的压力越来越大。大选在即，继续采取过去近二年来的消极态度，会影响阿登纳党的竞选。不得已而谈判，并不真想成功，于是就得寻找借口以使得谈判有名无实。他们找到了“遣返德国公民问题”。
    在苏联和西德政府开始会谈之前，阿登纳就致函苏联政府要把贸易谈判同“遣返德国人问题”联系起来，并以“遣返问题”作为进行贸易谈判的先决条件。西德外交部长勃伦塔诺也表示：如不解决“遣返”问题，西德将不和苏联签订贸易条约。
    在实际谈判中，西德政府代表团故意把“遣返德国公民”问题提到首要地位，并且力图把这个问题作为会谈的中心内容。虽然谈判本来是为了解决贸易和领事关系的。西德代表团的这种态度已经两次使苏联和西德的谈判中断，但它依然不肯改变这种无理的态度，并且借口双方在“遣返问题”上的分歧而停止谈判。
    阿登纳政府在谈判中的这种做法，说明它和苏联进行谈判是没有诚意的。它之所以在这个时候表面上表示“愿意”和苏联政府谈判，并且采取不正式使谈判破裂的做法，不过是大选前夕的一个把戏，想用以掩盖它阻挠改进东西方关系的事实，同时煽起沙文主义的情绪，有利于阿登纳党在选举中获胜。
