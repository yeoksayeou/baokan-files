Big-Character Posters in Tianjin Enterprises

    Materials Are Everywhere in the Factory
    In our factory’s cost-saving efforts, production was emphasized, but waste was not. If you take a walk around the factory, you can see machine parts and leftover materials everywhere. In Workshop One, there are piles and piles of discarded castings, both defective and non-defective, and those no longer needed after the task is completed. In Workshop Four, the leftover materials are all large pieces, also scattered in piles. The leaders of Workshop One and Workshop Four didn’t see these problems, only knowing to work, work, and work in the past, without managing the remaining materials. No wonder the director of the Mechanical Bureau said during his inspection visit: "Your factory has materials everywhere." I suggest that we should establish a cost-saving inspection committee to take responsibility for this, and the factory leaders should conduct thorough inspections.

    (State-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory Cadre Lü Xiangquan)

    Where Did the Determination to Streamline Go?
    The Party organization issued a call in the second quarter to streamline the organization and also made a mobilization report to management cadres, expressing the determination to streamline. At that time, it was estimated that sixty to seventy people would go down to the workshops, but why have only thirty-odd people gone down so far?
    From the perspective of the departments, there aren’t so many people needed. For example, some cadres in the General Affairs Section even go to mop the floor.
    May I ask the leaders, has your determination at that time been realized? Has the enthusiasm for implementing the Party's resolution passed so quickly?

    Requesting the Leaders to "Liberate" It
    Speaking of the General Factory, talking of the General Factory, the General Factory courtyard is truly spacious,
    Broken iron and messy wood are placed everywhere, there are also wooden boxes and straw baskets,
    Uneven coal piles don't even count, every corner is a mess,
    Piled up like mountains, no one cares, when you need to use them, you panic,
    Not to mention the impact on hygiene, the serious waste is distressing,
    These items have suffered hardship, requesting the leaders to "liberate" them.
      Tianjin Shi Tangci Zongchang Niu Zihua、Niu Yanfeng
      (Tianjin Enamel General Factory Niu Zihua, Niu Yanfeng)

    Dealing with Things Ad Hoc, Then Everyone Goes Their Separate Ways
    The leaders do not pay enough attention to infrastructure projects, lacking overall planning, doing things piecemeal and ad hoc, and the personnel are also gathered temporarily, transferring people from here and there. Once the work is finished, everyone disperses in all directions, each going their separate ways. For several years, the quality of the projects has not been improved, let alone accumulating experience and cultivating professional talent. Moreover, for each project, a new set of tools and equipment must be purchased, and organization and training are carried out, wasting manpower and resources.
    Tianjin Shi Nei Dianhua Ju Jishuyuan Wang Fangmin、Dou Chengxiang
    (Tianjin City Telephone Bureau Technicians Wang Fangmin, Dou Chengxiang)

    Always "Research, Research"
    Since my lathe accepted the task of making the plunger for the 200-ton hydraulic press, every time I do this work, I have to wait for the micrometer from Workshop Two. I must wait for them to finish using it before I can get it, which often affects the completion of the plan. Recently, although the factory bought another one, it is not accurate and cannot be used. For this matter, I have run to all levels of leadership departments, but it has not been resolved. Finally, it was pushed to the factory director, but the answer I received was still "research, research." May I ask the factory leaders, what responsibilities are you shouldering?

    天津企业里的大字报
    厂里到处是材料
    咱厂在节约方面，光看中生产，没看中浪费。你在厂内绕一圈，就可以看见到处都是机件和料头。如一车间的铸件废了的、没废的和任务完了用不着的，满处乱丢，这一堆、那一堆。四车间的料头都是老大块的，也是东一堆、西一堆。一车间和四车间的领导没看见这些，只知道干哪，干哪，干过去，剩下的东西也没人管了。无怪上次机械局长来厂检查工作说：你们厂到处都是材料。我说咱们应成立节约检查委员会担负起这个责任，厂领导应该认真检查。
    国营天津纺织机械厂干部　吕湘泉
    精简的决心哪里去了？
    党组织在第二季度作出精简机构的号召，也对管理干部作了动员报告，表示决心精简，当时算了算要下车间的有六十到七十人，但至今为什么才下来三十多人？
    从科室来看是不需要这么多人的，如总务科有的干部就去刷地板。
    请问领导，当时你们的决心是否实现了？执行党的决议的热呼劲是否一下子就过去了呢？
          天津汽车修配厂工人  邢连科
    请求领导“解放”它
    说总厂、道总厂，总厂大院真宽敞，
    破铁乱木处处放，又有木箱和席筐，
    煤块凹凸还不算，各个角落乱洋洋，
    堆积成山无人管，要应用时着了慌，
    影响卫生不用说，浪费严重令人伤，
    这些物件遭了难，请求领导“解放”它。
      天津市搪瓷总厂  牛子华、牛彦峰
    事来临时现抓，完事各奔前程
    领导对基建工程重视不够，缺乏总体安排，零星现凑，人员也临时现抓，东调西凑。工作一结束，四处分散，各奔前程。几年来工程质量老也提不高，更谈不到积累经验、培养专业人材。而且，每一工程必须新置一套工具设备，进行组织训练等，浪费人力物力。
    天津市内电话局技术员
                汪芳珉、窦澄湘
    总是“研究，研究”
    自从我的车床接受做二百吨液压机的柱塞任务以来，每逢做此活时，总要等二车间的千分尺，必须等他们用完才能拿来，一等就是几个钟头，常常影响计划的完成。最近，厂里虽然又买了一个，但不准确，不能用。为此事，我跑遍了各级领导部门，一直解决不了，最后推到厂长那儿，但是，得到的答复还是“研究研究”，请问厂里的领导，你们负的是什么责任？
