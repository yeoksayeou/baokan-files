    In the days before National Day
    Private Shi Zenghua (first in the front row) enlisted in the army this January. He received an award for his training. Now, he will appear as a mighty soldier for the first time in front of Tiananmen Square to be reviewed by Chairman Mao. Look how spirited he is now in training.
    On Tiananmen Square during the holidays, pots of blooming chrysanthemums are arranged every year. Why can they bloom two months earlier than the season? It turns out that this is because of the short-day treatment cultivated by Liu Zhenyuan, a famous chrysanthemum-growing elder in Beijing.
　　Yan Guojun, a worker in the weaving workshop of Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3, will participate in the National Day parade for the first time this year. She is rushing to make a new dress for this and trying it on once or twice to see if it fits.
    The suburbs of Beijing had a bumper harvest this year, and the corn is growing big and full. Jiang Yunmei, a 76-year-old commune member, said: "Every grain of food is connected to our farmers' love for the Communist Party. If I were younger, I would definitely hold this big corn high and participate in the National Day parade."
    Zhang Xiaoyu will sit in a small car and participate in the National Day parade with her mother for the first time.
    During the National Day celebrations at night, searchlights from all directions turn on and off together. Many people stare at the sky, trying to find a command light, but it's sometimes east, sometimes west, and they can't be sure. It turns out their command post is on the corner of a city wall.
    When the fireworks go off, the joy reaches a climax. Who makes the fireworks? They are Guo Xiuqun (center), a senior technician at the Fireworks Production Cooperative, and members Lang Miaozhen (left) and Gao Zhenqi, among others.
    Beijing velvet silk flower handicraft artists are rushing to make a "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" model, symbolizing "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," for the National Day parade.
    The art world is added to this year’s National Day parade’s cultural troupe. Students from the Central Academy of Arts and Design are arranging floats symbolizing a new beginning for everything and the blossoming of a hundred flowers.
    During every holiday, countless colorful balloons always fly into the sky above Tiananmen Square. Most of these balloons are filled with hydrogen by the students of the Beijing Meteorological School. 本报记者摄影 [Photographed by our reporter]

    在国庆的前几天
    列兵石增华（前排第一名）是今年1月应征入伍的，他在练兵中获得队前奖励。现在，他将以一个威武军人的姿态，第一次到天安门前接受毛主席的检阅。你看，他现在练得多神气。
    节日的天安门上，年年都排列着一盆一盆的盛开着的菊花。它们为什么能在节令前提早两个月开放呢？原来这是北京著名的种菊老人刘?园老先生用短日法培育出来的。
　　北京国棉三厂织布车间工人阎国君今年将要第一次参加国庆节游行，她为此赶做了一件新衣，一次两次地试穿，看它合身不合身。
    北京郊区今年大丰收，玉米长得又大又饱满。七十六岁的老社员姜韻梅说：“粒粒粮食都连着我们农民热爱共产党的心。如果我还年青的话，我一定要高举着这大玉米，参加国庆游行”。
    张小玉将坐在小车里，第一次和妈妈一起去参加国庆游行。
    国庆节的夜间，四面八方的探照灯光同起同灭。很多人凝视着天空，想找出一个指挥灯来，可是忽东忽西，总也肯定不了。原来它们的指挥部是在一个城墙的角上。
    当礼花升起的时候，欢乐达到了高潮。是谁制造的花炮呢？他们是花炮生产合作社老技术员郭秀群（中）、社员郎妙贞（左）和高振起等等。
    北京市绒绢花手工艺艺人们为参加国庆游行，赶制着象征百家争鸣的百鸟朝凤模型。
    今年国庆游行文艺大队中，增加了美术界的行列。中央工艺美术学院的学生们正在布置象征万象更新、百花齐放的彩车。
    每当节日，天安门上空总要飞起无数彩色缤纷的气球，这些气球大部分是北京气象学校的同学们用氢气灌制的。	本报记者摄影
