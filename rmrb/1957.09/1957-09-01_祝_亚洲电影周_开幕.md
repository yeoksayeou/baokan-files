    Congratulations on the Opening of "Asian Film Week"
    Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau
    The Asian Film Week, long awaited by the vast audience of China, opened on August 31 in our capital, Beijing. This is a major event in the cultural life of the Chinese people, and also a major event in the cultural exchange of Asian countries. It will make a great contribution to the cause of Asian peace and world peace. I sincerely wish this Film Week a complete success!
    This Asian Film Week will screen films recommended by more than a dozen Asian countries, and more than a dozen countries have been invited to send delegations to participate in the Film Week's activities. This shows that filmmakers from Asian countries are paying close attention to this Film Week and are giving active support in practical work and activities. Undoubtedly, this is a grand gathering of Asian film art and a meeting of filmmakers. As a Chinese filmmaker, I feel extremely honored to welcome such a grand event, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and warm welcome to the filmmakers' representatives from various countries for their hard work and long journey!
    The films participating in the Film Week, as well as the films prepared to be watched together with filmmakers from various countries who have come from afar, are all excellent works selected by filmmakers from Asian countries. These works fully demonstrate the great achievements made by filmmakers from Asian countries in film art creation.
    Although the films of various countries have different themes, all the films profoundly express the real lives and thoughts and feelings of the people of various countries. The social systems of various countries are different, and religious beliefs are different, but they all have a common historical process: liberating themselves from the oppression of colonialism, or striving for their independence and freedom. Everyone also has a common wish: to make unremitting efforts for a better life. The film artists of various countries, without exception, have expressed the spirit and will of the vast people of various countries who love their motherland, love justice, love freedom, and love peace through their films, which has greatly moved and encouraged us.
    These works comprehensively and truthfully reflect the lives of the people of Asian countries. The film artists have brought the reality of the lives of the vast people to the screen with their solemn works. It has no deception, no anesthesia, and even less obscenity, pornography, and horror. Seeing the tragic life on the screen makes people cry, seeing the heroic struggle against colonialism makes people encouraged, and seeing the ongoing construction and happy life makes people excited. Although most of the films reflect a tragic life, they do not make the audience pessimistic and disappointed, but give the audience strength. All the films happen to form an epitome of the lives of the Asian people, and comprehensively illustrate the struggle between good and evil through the stories and characters in the films. They love good and oppose evil, love peace and oppose violence and dark forces, sympathize with the tragic lives of the vast people with noble feelings, and sing praises of the great struggle of the people, and sing praises of and yearn for a better life.
    From these films, it can be fully seen that the film artists of our Asian countries are working hard to get rid of foreign influences, inherit the long-standing national art traditions, and strive to create artistic and realistic works with national styles. Many excellent directors, excellent actors, excellent cinematographers, and art workers have emerged from the films. They have ingeniously portrayed the images of their own people, skillfully absorbed and used the beautiful and colorful national music and dance, forming a strong national sentiment in many films, giving people an indelible impression. Of course, many films are not without shortcomings, such as: the rhythm is generally too slow, some of the plots are not reasonable enough, the performances are still somewhat exaggerated, and there is some excessive mixing of dance and songs. But, on the whole, the artistic achievements of the films are huge, and generally have reached a fairly high level, giving new brilliance to the ancient art of Asian countries.
    Through this Film Week, the mutual understanding and recognition of the lives and wishes of the people of various countries will be increased, and the friendly relations between various countries will be strengthened. Due to the long-term instigation of the colonialists, the mutual understanding and recognition between the people of Asian countries is very insufficient; therefore, this mutual understanding and recognition is very valuable, and it is the foundation of the friendship between our countries and peoples. On the basis of this further understanding and recognition, the friendly exchanges, cultural exchanges and peaceful unity between the peoples of various countries can inevitably be better developed.
    This gathering of filmmakers from more than a dozen countries is a friendly and united gathering. There are so many countries and the scale is so large, which is unprecedented in international film activities in Asia; our gathering should also become a gathering to establish and develop the friendship of filmmakers, and a gathering to exchange film work experience.
    China's film industry has made great progress since the founding of New China, but in terms of the overall development of our country, it is still far behind the requirements of reality. We will take this opportunity to learn from filmmakers from various countries, and sincerely learn from the film work experience of various countries.
    We should actively carry out cultural exchanges between countries. The principle of cultural exchange should be to respect each other's national culture, rather than obliterating the strengths and advantages of any country, in order to learn from each other and observe each other. The social systems of our various countries are different, and the man-made difficulties between our various countries still exist, but this should not become an obstacle to cultural exchange. Under the premise of peace in Asia and the unity of Asian countries, we should cooperate friendly and actively carry out cultural exchanges and cooperation, especially the exchange and cooperation of film art works with a broad mass character. This gathering will make a great contribution.
    Our Asian countries have always been considered countries that are backward in terms of economy and culture. In fact, this situation has undergone and is undergoing great changes. In terms of film alone, our Asian countries have made great progress and achievements, and many countries have a good foundation and conditions; we also have a long and rich cultural heritage. I believe that the culture and art of our Asian countries will develop rapidly. We filmmakers will work harder to develop the film art of our Asian countries, and serve the friendship between countries and peoples in Asian countries, and serve the peace of Asia and the world with film art!

### 祝“亚洲电影周”开幕

    祝“亚洲电影周”开幕
    电影事业管理局局长  王阑西
    中国广大观众翘望已久的亚洲电影周于8月31日在我国首都北京开幕了。这是中国人民文化生活中的一件大事，同时也是亚洲国家文化交流中的一件大事。它将对亚洲和平事业和世界和平事业作出很大的贡献。我衷心地祝贺这次电影周获得圆满的成功！
    这次亚洲电影周将放映亚洲十几个国家所推荐的影片，并且还有十几个国家应邀派来代表团参加电影周的活动，这说明亚洲各国的电影工作者对这个电影周寄予殷切的注意，和在实际工作与活动上给予积极的支持。无疑地，这是亚洲各国电影艺术会演和电影工作者会见的盛会。我作为中国的电影工作者，迎接这样一个盛会，感到万分的光荣，并谨对各国电影工作者代表们的不辞辛苦地远道光临表示衷心的感谢和热烈的欢迎！
    参加电影周放映的影片，以及准备与远道而来的各国电影工作者们共聚一堂来观摩的影片，都是经过亚洲各国电影工作者选送来的优秀作品。这些作品充分表现出亚洲各国电影工作者在电影艺术创作方面所获得的巨大成就。
    各国的影片虽然有着各种不同的题材，但所有的影片都深刻地表现着各国人民的现实生活和思想感情。各个国家的社会制度有所不同，宗教信仰有所不同，但都有一个共同的现实的历程：从殖民主义的压迫下解放出来，或是正在争取自己的独立和自由。大家又有一个共同的愿望：为美好的生活而进行不懈的努力。各国的电影艺术家们，没有例外地都通过影片表达了各国广大人民那种爱祖国、爱正义、爱自由、爱和平的精神和意志，而使我们受到了很大的感动和鼓舞。
    这些作品概括地真实地反映亚洲国家人民的生活，电影艺术家们用他们的庄严的作品，把广大人民的生活现实搬上了银幕。它没有欺骗，没有麻醉，更没有淫秽、色情和恐怖。从银幕上，看到悲惨的生活时使人落泪，看到反对殖民主义的英勇斗争时使人鼓舞，看到进行着的建设和愉快生活时使人兴奋，虽然多数的影片反映着悲剧的生活，但并不使观众悲观失望，而给观众以力量。全部影片恰好组织成了一个亚洲人民生活的缩影，概括地通过影片的故事和人物来说明善和恶的斗争。他们热爱善反对恶，热爱和平反对暴力和黑暗势力，以崇高的感情同情广大人民的悲惨生活，歌颂人民的伟大斗争，歌颂和向往着美好的生活。
    从这些影片可以充分看出，我们亚洲各国的电影艺术家都在努力摆脱外来的影响，继承着悠久的民族艺术传统，努力创造民族风格的艺术和现实主义的作品，从影片中已涌现出许多优秀的导演，优秀的演员，优秀的摄影师和美术工作者，他们天才地刻画出本民族人民的形象，巧妙地汲取和运用了优美的、丰富多彩的民族的音乐和舞蹈，形成了许多影片的强烈的民族情调，给人以难以泯灭的印象。当然，许多影片中还不是没有缺点的，如：一般地节奏过于缓慢，某些情节的不够合理，表演上尚有某些夸张，以及有些过多地掺入舞蹈和歌曲。但，总起来说，影片的艺术成就是巨大的，一般地均达到了相当高的水平，为亚洲国家的古老艺术发出了新的光辉。
    通过这次的电影周，将增加各国彼此之间对人民的生活和愿望之相互了解和认识，将加强各国彼此之间的友好关系。亚洲国家人民之间由于殖民主义者长期的挑拨，我们的相互了解，相互认识是很不够的；因此，这种相互了解和认识是十分可贵的，是我们的国家、人民之间的友好的基础。在这种进一步的了解和认识的基础上，必然可以更好地发展各国人民之间的友好交往、文化交流与和平团结。
    这次十余个国家电影工作者欢聚一堂，是一次友谊的团结的聚会，国家这样多，规模这样大，在亚洲范围的国际电影活动中是史无前例的；我们的聚会也应该成为建立与发展电影工作者友谊的聚会，成为交流电影工作经验的聚会。
    中国的电影事业在新中国成立以后有了很大的发展，但按我国总的发展情况来说，还远远落后于现实的要求，我们将趁此机会向各国电影工作者学习，衷心地学习各国电影工作的经验。
    我们应该积极进行各国之间的文化交流。文化交流的原则应该是互相尊重彼此的民族文化，而不是抹煞任何一国的特长和优点，以便互相学习和观摩。我们各国的社会制度是有所不同的，我们各国之间人为的困难也还是存在的，但，这不应该成为文化交流的阻碍。在为了亚洲和平、亚洲各国的团结的前提下，应该友好合作，积极地开展文化方面的交流和合作，特别是具有广泛群众性的电影艺术作品的交流和合作，这次聚会将会有极大的贡献。
    我们亚洲国家一向是被认为在经济和文化方面都落后的国家，实际上这种情况已有了和正在进行着大的变化。仅就电影来说，我们亚洲国家已有了很大的发展和成就，许多国家已有了良好的基础和条件；我们又有着悠久的丰富的文化遗产，我相信我们亚洲国家的文化艺术会迅速地发展起来。我们电影工作者将会更努力发展我们亚洲各国的电影艺术，并以电影艺术为亚洲各国国家与人民之间的友谊服务，为亚洲和世界的和平服务！
