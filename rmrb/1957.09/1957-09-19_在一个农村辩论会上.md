At a Rural Debate
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yan Quanwen

The bright gas lamp hung on the pillar of the stage. Below the stage, men and women were sitting, excitedly debating in groups of ten or more. I walked over and found a stool to sit down.

"She says socialism is no good. That's complete nonsense, complete nonsense! Take me for example! When I was farming individually, my family could only eat a little over 200 catties of grain per person per year. After joining the advanced cooperative, we eat more than 420 catties each year, and we also received more than 70 yuan in surplus grain money. Why is socialism no good? Anyone who says that has no conscience and wants to take the capitalist road!" This was an old man, probably in his sixties. He spoke very excitedly, his white beard trembling.

"I want to ask her, she said on the street: 'Cooperatives are good, but there isn't enough grain to eat, the old people are starving and can't work, and the young people are running everywhere.' Isn't that opposing unified purchase and supply? That's spreading rumors! Tell her to say, which young person ran away? Tell her to say!"

"I say this person has the least conscience. What kind of life did her family live before liberation? After liberation, they were given land, given livestock, and their lives improved, but they forgot their roots. Truly without conscience!" Another old man's voice rang out excitedly.

The upsurge of mass debate continued to rise, and everyone issued firm voices. This voice rushed into the sky, breaking through the temporary clouds in the sky; this voice rushed into the ears of every peasant, strengthening their confidence and determination to take the socialist road; this voice rushed into the ears of rural rightists, making them tremble.

In the center of the crowd stood a middle-aged woman, a snow-white towel on her head. She opened her mouth and said, "I say, this is my mistake. What I said was dissatisfied with socialism. I forgot the pain of my past life, forgot my roots, and what I said was not conducive to socialist construction. Today, I am making a self-criticism, criticizing my mistakes, criticizing myself for wanting to take the capitalist road. I will never say such things again in the future, and I will resolutely take the socialist road. Please give me your opinions!"

This woman who spoke was a new middle peasant in the village. Before joining the cooperative, her family had land and livestock, and lived a good life. She wanted to buy land and develop capitalism. Later, she was swept into the tide during the high tide of cooperation, but she always thought about withdrawing from the cooperative, buying land, getting rich, and taking the capitalist road.

It was already very late.

Someone announced, "Comrades, our meeting today will end here. We still have to produce tomorrow! We will continue the debate tomorrow night. She has only initially realized her mistakes today, and she still needs to understand them well tomorrow."

The meeting adjourned. I followed the people out of the venue. At the door, an old woman said as she walked, "There isn't enough grain to eat now? That's really nonsense. What did we eat before? If it weren't for joining the advanced cooperative, I, this old woman, don't know what I would be like now. My family in the old society..." I didn't hear the end of her words, as I was squeezed into the center of the street.　——At Xizhaoxian Village, Wen County

　　在一个农村辩论会上
　　阎铨文
    明亮的汽灯挂在戏台的台柱上，在台的下边，坐满了男男女女的人们，十数个人一组在激动地辩论着。我走了过去，找个凳头坐下来。
    “她说社会主义不好，这完全是胡说，完全是胡说，就拿我来说吧！单干时我家每人每年才能吃二百多斤粮食，入了高级社每年吃四百二十多斤，还分了七十多元的余粮款。社会主义为啥不好？说这话的就是没有良心，想走资本哩！”这是一个大概有六十多岁的老大爷，他十分激动地讲着，白色的胡子在颤动。
    “我要问问她，她在街上说：‘合作化好是好，就是粮食吃不饱，老头饿得不劳动，青年饿得到处跑。’这不是反对统购统销是啥？这是造谣！叫她说，哪一个青年跑了？叫她说！”
    “我说这个人最没有良心了，解放前她家过的是啥生活？解放了，分了地，分了牲口，生活好了，可忘本了。真没良心！”又是一个老大爷激动的声音。
    群众辩论的热潮在继续上涨，个个人发出了坚定的声音，这声音冲上天空，冲破了天上一时的游云；这声音冲进个个农民的耳中，坚定了走社会主义道路的信心和决心；这声音冲进农村右派分子的耳中，使他们发抖。
    在人群的中央站起来一个中年妇女，头上顶一条雪白的毛巾，开口说：“我说，这是我的错误，我说的话是对社会主义不满，我忘了从前生活的痛苦，忘了本，说出的话对社会主义建设不利。今天我检讨，检讨我的错误，检讨自己想走资本主义，我以后再不说这样的话了，要坚决走社会主义。请大家对我提意见吧！”
    发言的这个女人，是本村的一个新中农，在入社前她家有地，有牲口，生活过得很好，想买地，想发展资本主义。后来在合作化的高潮中随着潮流卷了进来，可是自己总想着退社，买地、发财，走资本主义的道路。
    时间已经很晚了。
    一个人宣布说：“同志们，今天我们的会就开到这里，明天还要生产哩！等到明天夜里我们再继续进行辩论。她在今天才初步认识到错误了，明日还得好好地再认识。”
    散会了。我随着人们走出会场。在门口一位老大娘边走边说：“现在的粮食不够吃？真是胡说，从前我们吃的是啥？要不是入了高级社，我这老婆婆现在还不知是啥样呢。我家在旧社会……”我没有听完她的话，就被挤到街的中央。　——于温县西招贤村
