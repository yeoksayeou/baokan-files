A Serious Struggle in the Countryside
—Comrade Tao Zhu on Rural Rectification Issues at the Shaoguan Prefectural Committee Three-Level Cadre Meeting—

On September 6, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech on rural rectification issues at a three-level cadre meeting convened by the Shaoguan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China. In his speech, he discussed the following issues: facing up to the current contradictions in the countryside; organizing a large-scale, in-depth debate on the two roads; resolutely taking measures to systematically improve work and vigorously rectify backward cooperatives; and rectifying the Party and Youth League organizations in the countryside.

It is Necessary to Face Up to the Current Struggle Between the Two Roads in the Countryside

Tao Zhu first pointed out that it is necessary to face up to the current contradictions existing in the countryside. The current contradictions in the countryside can be summarized as the struggle between the two roads. Whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road is still a matter of different opinions, and this is the manifestation of the contradiction. If this contradiction is not resolved, rural work will not only fail to move forward but will also regress.

He then pointed out that this rural rectification is a continuation of the socialist transformation of agriculture and is part of the great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts that is taking place throughout the country. After agricultural cooperativization, although we have already carried out a socialist revolution on the economic front with respect to the ownership of the means of production, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has not been carried out well, and the major issue of right and wrong between the two roads has not been thoroughly clarified among the peasant masses; politically, many cooperatives have not established strong socialist leadership, and a few cooperatives have even almost disintegrated. Thus, socialism in the countryside is still not very consolidated. Therefore, after the victory of the socialist transformation in the economy, it is still necessary to carry out a socialist revolution in politics and ideology, to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against capitalist ideas in the countryside, and to continue this struggle for several years. In this way, the socialist system can be completely consolidated in the countryside.

Tao Zhu continued: In fact, the struggle between the two roads is the central issue of all current work in the countryside and the basic key to all work. If this issue is resolved well, production will be good, and the morale of cadres and the masses will be high; if this issue is not resolved well, the morale of cadres and the masses will not be high, and production will not be good either. After the cooperativization movement, we did not emphasize the need to continue the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in the countryside and remind everyone to pay attention. Last year's provincial Party congress emphasized opposing the ideological style of cadres lacking a mass viewpoint, not caring about the suffering of the masses, and acting on compulsion, which was not only correct at the time but also correct in the future. However, it now seems that this congress also produced some side effects, that is, in the relationship between the state and peasants and between cooperatives and members, it excessively emphasized taking care of the interests of the peasants, while it did not emphasize enough obedience to state plans and safeguarding collective interests. In addition, after the opening of the free market, market management was relaxed, giving an opportunity for elements with serious capitalist ideas to exploit. Therefore, since the second half of last year, capitalist ideas in the countryside have gradually tended to become superficial from latent. Many cadres have deviated in their understanding of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people and have shrunk back; landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements under control have taken the opportunity to engage in activities, coupled with the influence of the rampant attacks of urban right-wing elements, and the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in the countryside has become more prominent and acute.

Is this contradiction and struggle manifested in the debate over whether there are shortcomings in the work of cooperatives and unified purchase and sale, and whether improvements are needed? Tao Zhu said: No. We have had shortcomings in our work in the past, we have them now, and we will have them in the future. Communists never conceal their shortcomings and mistakes, and they must take a firm, serious, and responsible attitude to correct them. Otherwise, we cannot move forward. One of the main purposes of rectifying cooperatives through the current great airing of views, great contending, and great debate is to overcome shortcomings, correct mistakes, and run the cooperatives well. However, those who deny the superiority of cooperativization and the necessity of unified purchase and sale do not realistically and specifically analyze the shortcomings in the work, take an active attitude to improve the work and solve the problems, but exaggerate the shortcomings and problems, trying to attack this new socialist system of cooperatives and the correct measures of unified purchase and sale from all aspects, in order to finally disintegrate the cooperatives and destroy unified purchase and sale. This is not a matter of minor right and wrong, but a matter of major right and wrong. This is the struggle between the two roads.

Next, Tao Zhu pointed out that on such a fundamental issue, some well-to-do peasants and some cadres have shown varying degrees of wavering towards socialism, and even a few people have attempted to take the old road of capitalism. Some well-to-do peasants openly said: "Cooperatives are not as good as mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams are not as good as individual households." "Unified purchase and sale is the state's exploitation of peasants," fundamentally negating the superiority of cooperatives and the correctness of unified purchase and sale. More seriously, some Party members and cadres also sympathize with and echo this clamor, opposing socialism. There can only be two attitudes towards this issue: one is to turn back, disband the cooperatives, and abolish unified purchase and sale, the result of which will inevitably be the abolition of socialism; the result will inevitably be that a large number of peasants will return to the miserable life of poverty and bankruptcy. The other is to resolutely conduct an irreconcilable struggle against this capitalist ideology, improve the shortcomings in the work, run the cooperatives well, do a good job in unified purchase and sale, resolutely take the socialist road, and ensure that the vast number of peasants live a prosperous and happy life. Tao Zhu said: In the face of this serious struggle, everyone must express a clear attitude: what to support? What to oppose? He said that it can now be seen that the vast majority of Party and Youth League members and cadres can stand their ground in the face of this struggle, and they support cooperativization and the policy of unified purchase and sale; all revolutionary people, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants who account for more than 80% of the rural population, support cooperativization and the policy of unified purchase and sale. However, there are also a few people who oppose it. Who is opposed to it? In addition to the class enemies we have already overthrown—landlords, rich peasants, and the remaining counter-revolutionary elements—there are also some well-to-do peasants with serious capitalist ideas and lazy people and hooligans who have not yet been transformed. They are only a small number of people, but they echo the bourgeois right-wing elements in the cities and the right-wing elements in the Party, and they blatantly launch vicious and frantic attacks on the Party and the socialist system. Therefore, the struggle appears very sharp and prominent.

After making the above analysis, Tao Zhu summarized and said: This is the basic situation in the countryside today. Under this situation, we must not have the slightest wavering, and we must not retreat. We must trust the majority of the masses, constantly expand the socialist阵地 in the countryside, and gradually shrink and eliminate the capitalist 阵地. This is the entire significance of launching this rural socialist propaganda and education movement and comprehensively rectifying the cooperatives.

In Order to Defeat Capitalist Ideas, We Must Let Go and Have a Great Airing of Views, Great Contending, and Great Debate

How can we defeat the attack of capitalist ideas and make socialist ideas win? Tao Zhu pointed out that we must organize a large-scale and in-depth debate on the two roads and let go and have a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate in the countryside. This is the main form of the current socialist education movement. He said that we must regard this great debate as the third great mass revolutionary movement in the countryside after the land reform movement and the cooperativization movement.

Tao Zhu repeatedly emphasized the importance of presenting facts and reasoning in the great airing of views, great contending, and great debate. He said that peasants value facts, and facts are the most eloquent. As long as we present the facts, settle accounts, and explain the reasons, the peasants will understand the situation and accept the principles of socialism. We must be full of confidence in our own strength, firmly rely on the basic masses, implement the class line, and win victory in the great debate.

Tao Zhu also pointed out that after the debate, we should isolate the small number of people with serious capitalist ideas and free the majority of peasants from the influence of capitalist ideas, resolutely taking the socialist road. This cannot be solved by the general methods of rectification in the past, and we must take the greatest determination and strength to carry out arduous and meticulous ideological education work in order to do a good job. The struggle on the ideological and political fronts is sharp, but it must be a struggle of reasoning within the peasants, without applying pressure, presenting facts, and reasoning. Only through careful investigation and research, carefully analyzing various arguments, and fully relying on various persuasive specific materials in the local area can we explain the principles thoroughly and convince people with reason. Any simple, crude, and formalistic approach is wrong and must be avoided as much as possible.

Organize a Strong Socialist Class Contingent

What is the key to doing a good job in the great debate? Tao Zhu pointed out that the key lies in being able to organize a strong socialist class contingent after a full airing of views and great contending, and no cooperative should be an exception. At present, some cooperatives have not seriously organized a strong socialist class contingent. Good cooperatives have initially formed a contingent, but they lack training and are not strong enough; poorly run cooperatives have not formed a contingent at all, and only a few activists are fighting alone. In order to organize a strong class contingent, there must be a strong leadership core, through which to unite the peasants who are determined to take the socialist road and win over those who are willing to take the socialist road but are still a little wavering. With such a class contingent, it is possible to conduct reasoning struggles with well-to-do peasants with serious capitalist ideas. At the same time as organizing the class contingent, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements who sabotage cooperativization and unified purchase and sale, as well as hooligans who engage in sabotage activities and refuse to mend their ways despite repeated education, should be dealt with seriously by the government according to the severity of their illegal crimes.

It is Necessary to Take Measures to Systematically Improve Work

In his speech, Tao Zhu emphasized that in addition to acting in accordance with the class line, we must also resolutely take measures to systematically improve our work.

Tao Zhu proposed that, from the perspective of the entire province, the relationship between the state and the peasants, the relationship between the cooperative and the members, and the relationship between the cooperative and individual households and withdrawing households should all be improved in the great airing of views, great contending, and great debate.

Capitalist ideas have the greatest impact in backward cooperatives, and we must concentrate our efforts on rectifying backward cooperatives.

Regarding the issue of rectification work before the autumn harvest, Tao Zhu focused on his views and methods for rectifying backward cooperatives. He said: About 15% or even more of the cooperatives in the province are backward cooperatives, and capitalist ideas have the greatest impact in these cooperatives. Doing a good job in running these cooperatives is equivalent to eliminating some strongholds of capitalism in the countryside. Therefore, we must concentrate our efforts on rectifying these cooperatives. The main signs of such cooperatives are that the leadership is seriously divorced from the masses, approaching a state of disintegration; production is not good; there is no or basically no socialist class contingent; and capitalist ideas are rampant. We must recognize the seriousness and complexity of the problems in such cooperatives and absolutely not underestimate this work. To rectify such cooperatives, we must send strong work teams to lead the work and systematically and meticulously solve the problems. The county party committee secretary must personally grasp the rectification work of such cooperatives.

What are the signs that the great airing of views, great contending, and great debate are being done well? Tao Zhu proposed: We must see whether the peasants' class consciousness has been raised after the movement, whether the prestige of the Party organization, Party members, and cadres has been raised among the masses, whether those with serious capitalist ideas have been isolated, and whether the production work of the entire cooperative has been done well.

While Rectifying the Cooperatives, We Must Rectify the Party and Youth League Organizations in the Countryside

Tao Zhu pointed out that the Party and Youth League organizations in the countryside must be rectified well, and the rectification of the cooperatives must be carried out simultaneously with the rectification of the Party and the Youth League. He said that the most important thing to do in running the cooperatives well is that our Party should become the socialist leadership core within the cooperative, capable of leading the peasants to constantly wage a resolute struggle against capitalist ideas.

Tao Zhu finally said that in this great airing of views, great contending, and great debate in the countryside, we must raise the class consciousness of cadres, strengthen the class stand of cadres, and improve our work style. Now we have to pass the socialist hurdle, and this great socialist revolutionary struggle on the political and ideological fronts of the whole people will inevitably be reflected in the Party and among the cadres, so it is even more necessary to rectify the Party and the ranks of cadres well. We must resolutely oppose bureaucratic elements and degenerated elements who have lost their revolutionary will. Every Communist Party member must have a high sense of responsibility to the people and a strong revolutionary will, and should be vigorous and indomitable in overcoming difficulties and doing a good job by all means. This socialist education movement throughout the province should become the best test for every Party member.

　　农村中的一场严重的斗争
　　——陶铸同志在韶关地委三级干部会议上谈农村整社问题——
    中共广东省委第一书记陶铸于9月6日在中共韶关地委召开的三级干部会议上，作了一个关于农村整社问题的讲话。他在讲话中谈到下列几个问题：正视当前农村中存在的矛盾；组织一次规模巨大的、深入的关于两条道路的大辩论；坚决采取措施，系统地改进工作，大力地整顿落后社；把农村中的党团组织整顿好。
　　必须正视当前农村两条道路的斗争
    陶铸首先指出，必须正视当前农村存在的矛盾。当前农村中的矛盾，概括起来，就是两条道路的斗争。到底是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路，到现在还有不同的意见，这就是矛盾的表现。这个矛盾不解决，农村工作不仅不能前进一步，而且还要倒退。
    他接着指出：这次农村整社，就是对农业进行社会主义改造的继续，也就是正在全国进行的政治战线和思想战线上的伟大社会主义革命的一部分。在农业合作化以后，我们虽然已经在经济战线上对生产资料的所有制进行了社会主义革命，但是在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，还没有很好进行，还没有在农民群众中彻底弄清两条道路的大是大非；在政治上，还有许多合作社没有建立起坚强的社会主义领导，有少数社甚至几乎解体。这样，社会主义在农村就还不是很巩固的。因此，在经济上的社会主义改造胜利以后，还必须接着在政治上思想上进行一次社会主义革命，对农村中的资本主义思想进行不调和的斗争，而且要持续若干年。这样，社会主义的制度才能在农村中完全巩固。
    陶铸接着说：事实上，两条道路的斗争，是目前农村中一切工作的中心问题，是一切工作的基本关键。这个问题解决得好，生产就搞得好，干部和群众的情绪就会很高；这个问题解决得不好，干部和群众的情绪就不高，生产也就搞不好。我们在合作化运动以后，没有强调在农村中必须继续进行社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，提醒大家注意。去年省的党代表大会，强调反对干部中缺乏群众观点、不关心群众疾苦和强迫命令的思想作风，这不仅在当时是正确的，就是今后也是正确的。但是现在看来，这次大会也产生了一些副作用，就是在国家和农民以及合作社和社员的关系上，过分强调了照顾农民的利益，而对服从国家计划和维护集体利益则强调得不够。加上开放自由市场以后，放松了市场管理，给有严重资本主义思想的分子钻了空子。因此，去年下半年以来，农村中的资本主义思想，就从潜伏而逐渐趋于表面化。许多干部对如何正确处理人民内部矛盾，认识发生偏差，缩手缩脚；地主、富农和反革命管制分子，则乘机活动，加上城市右派分子猖狂进攻的影响，农村中社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，就更加突出和尖锐起来。
    这种矛盾和斗争是不是表现在合作社和统购统销的工作有没有缺点、要不要改进这样一些问题的争论上呢？陶铸说：不是的。我们工作上的缺点过去有，现在有，将来还会有。共产党人从不隐讳自己的缺点和错误，而且要采取坚决的、严肃的、负责的态度加以改正。否则，就不能前进。这次通过大鸣大放大争来整顿合作社的主要目的之一，就是为了克服缺点，改正错误，把社办好。但是那些否认合作化的优越性和统购统销的必要性的人，却不去实事求是地具体分析工作中的缺点，采取积极的改进工作和解决问题的态度，而是夸大缺点和问题，企图从各方面打击合作社这个新生的社会主义制度和统购统销这个正确的措施，以便最后瓦解合作社和破坏统购统销。这就不是小是小非问题，而是大是大非问题。这就是两条道路的斗争。
    接着，陶铸指出：在这样一个根本性的问题上，有部分富裕农民和部分干部对社会主义表现了不同程度的动摇，甚至还有少数人企图走资本主义的老路。有某些富裕农民公开讲：“合作社不如互助组，互助组不如单干户”“统购统销是国家剥削农民”，根本否定合作社的优越性和统购统销的正确性。更严重的是，在党员和干部中，也有人同情、附和这种叫嚣，反对社会主义。对这个问题，只能有两种态度：一是走回头路，解散合作社，取消统购统销，其结果就必然是取消社会主义；其结果，必然是大批农民再回到贫穷破产的苦难生活中去。一是坚决和这种资本主义思想作不调和的斗争，改进工作中的缺点，把合作社办好，把统购统销工作做好，坚决走社会主义道路，保障广大农民过繁荣幸福的生活。陶铸说：在这个严重的斗争面前，每个人都必须表示明确的态度：拥护什么？反对什么？他说，现在可以看出，绝大多数党团员和干部在这个斗争面前是站得住脚的，是拥护合作化和拥护统购统销政策的；所有革命的人民，特别是农村中占80％以上的贫农和下中农，是拥护合作化和统购统销政策的。但是，也有少数人反对。什么人反对呢？除了已经被我们打倒了的阶级敌人——地主、富农和残余的反革命分子以外，就是一部分资本主义思想严重的富裕农民和还没有经过改造的好吃懒做的懒汉和流氓。他们只是一小部分人，但是他们和城市中的资产阶级右派分子以及党内的右派分子互相呼应，明目张胆地向党和社会主义制度作恶毒的、疯狂的攻击。因此，斗争显得十分尖锐和突出。
    陶铸在作了上述分析以后，概括地说：这就是当前农村的基本形势。在这形势之下，我们绝不能有丝毫的动摇，绝不能退却。我们必须信赖群众的多数，在农村中不断扩大社会主义的阵地，逐步缩小和消灭资本主义的阵地。这就是这次开展农村社会主义宣传教育运动和全面整顿合作社的全部意义。
    为了战胜资本主义思想，必须放手大放大鸣大争
    怎样才能打垮资本主义思想的进攻，使社会主义思想取得胜利呢？陶铸指出，必须大规模地深入地组织一次关于两条道路的大辩论，放手在农村中大放大鸣大争。这是目前开展社会主义教育运动的主要形式。他说，我们要把这次大辩论看作是农村中继土地改革运动、合作化运动以后的第三次伟大的群众性的革命运动。
    陶铸再三强调在大鸣大放大争中摆事实、讲道理的重要性。他说，农民是重视事实的，而事实是最雄辩的。只要把事实摆出来，算清账，讲清道理，农民就会把事情弄清，接受社会主义的道理。我们必须对自己的力量充满信心，坚决依靠基本群众，贯彻阶级路线，在大辩论中取得胜利。
    陶铸还指出，经过辩论以后，把少数资本主义思想严重的人孤立起来，使大多数农民从资本主义思想影响下摆脱出来，坚决地走社会主义道路。这就不是过去一般的整社方法所能够解决的，必须拿出最大的决心和力量来，进行艰苦细致的思想教育工作，才能做好。这场思想战线和政治战线上的斗争是尖锐的，但必须是农民内部说理的斗争，不要施加压力，要摆事实，讲道理。只有经过细致的调查研究，仔细分析各种论点，充分依靠当地各种有说服力的具体材料，才能把道理说透，以理服人。任何简单粗暴、形式主义的做法，都是不对的，必须极力避免。
    组织一支强大的社会主义的阶级队伍
    什么是搞好大辩论的关键呢？陶铸指出，关键在于经过充分的大鸣大放之后，能够接着组织一支强大的社会主义的阶级队伍，每个合作社都不能例外。目前，一部分合作社还没有认真组织好一支强大的社会主义的阶级队伍。好的合作社已初步形成队伍，但缺乏训练，不够强大；办得差的社根本还未形成队伍，只有少数积极分子在孤军作战。为了组织强大的阶级队伍，要有坚强的领导核心，通过核心去团结坚决走社会主义道路的农民和争取愿意走社会主义道路但仍有点动摇的人们。有了这样的阶级队伍，就有可能去同有严重资本主义思想的富裕农民进行说理斗争。在组织阶级队伍的同时，对破坏合作化、破坏统购统销的地主、富农和反革命分子以及进行破坏活动而屡教不改的流氓分子，应由政府根据他们违法罪行的轻重分别予以严肃处理。
    必须采取措施，系统地改进工作
    陶铸在讲话中强调指出，除了按照阶级路线办事以外，还必须同时坚决采取措施，系统地改进工作。
    陶铸提出，从全省情况来看，在国家同农民的关系上，在社同社员的关系上，在合作社同单干户、退社户的关系上，都要在大鸣大放大争中加以改进。
    资本主义思想在落后社影响最大，要集中力量把落后社整好。
    对于秋收前的整社工作问题，陶铸着重提出了对落后社的看法和整法。他说：全省约有15％甚至还更多一些的合作社是落后社，资本主义思想在这些社里面的影响最大，办好这类社，就等于消灭了资本主义在农村中的一些据点。因此，要集中力量把这类社整好。这类社的主要标志是领导严重脱离群众，接近解体状态；生产搞不好；没有或基本没有形成社会主义的阶级队伍；资本主义思想泛滥。我们要认识这类社问题的严重性和复杂性，绝对不能轻视这个工作。要整好这类社，必须派强的工作组去领导，系统而细致地解决问题。县委书记要亲自抓这类社的整社工作。
    什么是大鸣大放大争搞得好的标志？陶铸提出：要看在运动之后农民的阶级觉悟是否提高了，党组织、党员和干部在群众中的威信是否提高了，有严重资本主义思想的人是否被孤立了，整个社的生产工作是否搞好了。
    在整社的同时，要整顿好农村的党、团组织
    陶铸指出，在农村中的党团组织必须整顿好，整社要同时整党、整团。他说，搞好合作社最重要的一条，是我们的党应成为社内的社会主义领导核心，能够领导农民经常对资本主义思想作坚决的斗争。
    陶铸最后说，在这次农村的大放大鸣大争中，要提高干部的阶级觉悟，坚定干部阶级立场，改进工作作风。现在要过社会主义关，这一场全民的政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命斗争必然要反映到党内和干部中来，因此更加要整好党和干部的队伍。要坚决反对官僚主义分子，和消失革命斗志的蜕化分子，每个共产党员都要有高度对人民负责的精神，和坚强的革命意志，应该朝气勃勃、百折不挠地用一切办法来克服困难，做好工作。这一次全省的社会主义教育运动应当成为对每一个党员的最好考验。
