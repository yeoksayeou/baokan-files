Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th -- The 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly began its general debate on September 19th.

    The first speaker at the General Assembly was the Brazilian representative, Aranha. He called on the Assembly to pay attention to the dangers of the continuing arms race. He particularly pointed out the special responsibility of the nuclear powers in deciding on questions of war and peace. He expressed his belief that regional and world problems and conflicts can and must be resolved peacefully within the United Nations.

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in his speech that followed, focused on the issues of disarmament and the Middle East. On both issues, he maliciously attacked the Soviet Union and tried his best to whitewash the U.S. position.

    On the issue of disarmament, Dulles reinterpreted the so-called "package" disarmament proposal put forward by the Western countries on August 29th. He insisted that the "Open Skies plan" seemed to be aimed at building mutual trust between nations. Dulles remained silent on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons, and only talked about prohibiting the production of fissile materials for military purposes. Dulles also constantly defended the continued testing of nuclear weapons. He also reiterated his opposition to an unconditional cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    Referring to the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Western countries' disarmament proposals, Dulles once again attempted to shift the blame for the deadlock in the disarmament negotiations from the Western countries to the Soviet Union. At the same time, Dulles used the deadlock in the disarmament negotiations to call for further strengthening of military alliances and continued expansion of armaments.

    Dulles's speech on the Middle East issue showed that the U.S. intends to continue to expand its interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. He insisted that the Soviet Union wanted to "dominate the Middle East," and repeated that the situation in Syria "threatened" neighboring countries.

    Ghanaian representative Akwaji said that the Ghanaian government is willing to contribute to the cause of maintaining world peace and security on the basis of broad cooperation among countries. His country will also resolutely fight to defend the equal rights of people of color.

    The head of the Japanese delegation, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, called on all countries to cooperate more closely to reach a disarmament agreement, especially an agreement to prohibit nuclear weapons. He said that the failure of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee to reach any concrete results has caused us deep disappointment. He called on the major powers to first overcome all obstacles and resolve this issue as soon as possible.

    He continued, the Japanese people and government believe that the cessation of nuclear weapons testing is of great significance. The issue of stopping testing is more urgent than other aspects of the disarmament issue.

    The next General Assembly is scheduled to continue on the 20th.

    联大开始一般性辩论
    巴西日本等国代表呼吁解决裁军问题
    杜勒斯为美国立场辩解恶意攻击苏联
    据新华社20日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十二届会议9月19日开始进行一般性辩论。
    大会会议上首先发言的是巴西代表阿兰纳。他呼吁大会注意继续进行军备竞赛的危险性。他特别指出拥有核武器的大国在决定战争和和平问题上的特殊责任。他表示相信，地区性和世界性的问题和冲突能够而且必须在联合国中取得和平解决。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在接着发言中着重谈到了裁军问题和中东问题。在这两个问题上，他都恶意地攻击苏联并且竭力粉饰美国的立场。
    关于裁军问题，杜勒斯重新解释了西方国家在8月29日提出的所谓“一揽子”裁军建议。他硬说，“开放天空的计划”似乎是为了建立国际间的互相信任。杜勒斯闭口不谈完全禁止核武器问题，而只谈禁止生产用于军事目的的分裂性原料。杜勒斯还不断地为继续进行核武器试验辩护。他并且重申反对无条件停止核武器试验。
    在谈到苏联对西方国家的裁军建议的态度时，杜勒斯再一次企图把西方国家造成裁军谈判僵局的罪责转嫁给苏联。同时杜勒斯利用裁军谈判的僵局呼吁进一步加强军事联盟和继续扩充军备。
    杜勒斯关于中东问题的发言，表明美国打算继续扩大对中东国家内政的干涉。他硬说苏联想“统治中东”，并且重复说什么叙利亚情势“威胁”到邻国。
    加纳代表阿克瓦吉发言说，加纳政府愿意在各国广泛合作的基础上为维护世界和平和安全的事业作出贡献。他的国家也将坚决为保卫有色民族的平等权利而奋斗。
    日本代表团团长、日本外务相藤山爱一郎呼吁各国为达成裁军协定、首先是达成禁止核武器的协定而进行更紧密的合作。他说，联合国裁军小组委员会未能达成任何具体结果引起了我们深刻的失望。他呼吁大国应首先克服一切障碍并且从速解决这个问题。
  他继续说，日本人民和政府认为，停止核武器试验具有重大的意义。停止试验的问题比裁军问题的其他方面都更加刻不容缓。
    下次大会预定在20日继续举行。
