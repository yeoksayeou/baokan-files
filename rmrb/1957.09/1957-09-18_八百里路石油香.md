　　Eight Hundred Li of Petroleum Fragrance
　　Pei Feng

　　If you have the opportunity to take a trip to the Qaidam petroleum exploration area, starting from Lenghu at the foot of the Altun Mountains, passing through Kaitelimirik, Youquanzi, and finally arriving at Yushashan on the shores of Gasi Lake, you can smell the fragrance of petroleum everywhere on the nearly eight hundred li road, and you can hear the footsteps of progress towards socialism everywhere. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the Qaidam petroleum exploration事业 (shìyè - cause, undertaking), in the first half of 1957, the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, has taken another big step forward.

　　Lenghu is one of the existing large petroleum exploration areas in the basin. The news of the first oil gushing from this exploration area last year once made people so excited that they couldn't calm down. This year, the exploration事业 (shìyè - cause, undertaking) here has achieved fruitful results, not only more wells have produced crude oil, but more importantly, deep oil layers have been drilled. Now, Lenghu is no longer a shallow oil reservoir with only one set of oil layers, but a petroleum base with two sets of oil layers. On the morning of May 27, when Deep Well No. 1 was drilled to 2,888 meters, oil sand was found in the core, and a blowout occurred even when the mud specific gravity was 1.38, with an oil and gas pressure of about 400 atmospheres. According to existing data, the depth of the deep oil layer is generally between 2,888 meters and 2,905 meters. This is the first deep oil layer found in the Qaidam Basin.

　　Kaitelimirik was an unknown place last year, with nothing but yellow dunes to be seen. This year, the light cavalry of the drilling industry—the "Light Drilling Team"—sounded the horn for developing Kaitelimirik, and good news soon spread. Crude oil gushed out on April 29 when drilling reached 38 meters, and crude oil gushed out again on May 5 when drilling reached more than 120 meters. The oil reservoir is so close to the ground, which is unprecedented. According to analysis, the quality of the crude oil is also very good. This is the second victory in this year's petroleum exploration in the basin.

　　Youquanzi is the earliest petroleum exploration area established in the basin. At the end of 1955, the first ton of crude oil was presented to Chairman Mao here, making it the earliest place to produce oil in Qaidam. This year, this exploration area has made great achievements again. From the afternoon of July 26 to the morning of July 27, the No. 9 medium-deep well intermittently gushed nearly 30 cubic meters of crude oil, with a spray height of 8 to 10 meters. The oil color is dark green, water-free, and of good quality. This proves that the area of the oil reservoir is larger than originally estimated. This well is located on the northern flank of the structure, while in the past it was estimated that the Youquanzi structure only had oil at the top. Youquanzi also established the first oil refinery in Qaidam this year. This small refinery plans to produce 3,000 tons of petroleum this year. At present, the infrastructure construction is in full swing, and it is expected to be put into production on National Day.

　　Another major victory in the basin's petroleum exploration事业 (shìyè - cause, undertaking) in the first half of this year is the establishment of the Yushashan new petroleum exploration area. All seven deep, medium-deep, and shallow wells drilled here have found oil sand with a total thickness of more than 100 meters. The sandstone is loose and has high permeability, proving that the Yushashan structure has a wide oil reservoir area and many oil layers, making it a very promising structure. The reason for saying it is very promising is not limited to the above. On May 23, Shallow Well No. 1 underwent an oil test, and within 17 hours and 40 minutes of the test production, 16,000 liters of oil were produced, which translates into a maximum daily output of 21 tons. This is an oil-bearing structure with industrial exploitation value, characterized by "low pressure but high output."

　　At 9:00 PM on September 7, the Qinghai Prospecting Brigade's Medium-Deep Well No. 1 drilling rig, on the Mahai structure, encountered crude oil gushing out of the borehole when it reached a depth of 474.77 meters. Because this borehole had encountered four high-pressure water layers and a layer of gas, the drilling rig had been using heavy mud for drilling from the beginning, so the crude oil did not gush out of the well. However, the three meters of oil sandstone core that has been extracted proves that this structure is a good oil layer.

　　The above is a brief overview of this year's petroleum exploration in the basin. When the broad masses of people learn about these situations, they will be infinitely inspired. Those rightist gentlemen who are anti-Party and anti-socialist may tremble and weep, but let them do so, the facts are always merciless.

　　八百里路石油香

    如果你有机会到柴达木的石油探区作一次旅行，从阿尔金山脚下的冷湖出发，经开特米里克、油泉子，最后到达尕寺湖畔的油砂山，在长达近八百华里的道路上，到处可以闻到石油的芳香，到处可以听到向社会主义迈进的脚步声。在共产党的英明领导下，柴达木的石油勘探事业，在第一个五年计划的最后一年——1957年的上半年，又大大跨进了一步。
    冷湖是盆地现有大型石油探区之一。这个探区去年首次喷油的消息，曾经使人们兴奋得不能平静下来。今年，这里的勘探事业又取得了丰硕的成果，不仅有更多的井流出了原油，更重要的是已经钻到了深油层。如今，冷湖已经不是只有一组油层的浅油藏，而是有两个组油层的石油基地了。在5月的27日早晨，深一井钻进两千八百八十八公尺的时候，取岩心中发现了油砂，在泥浆比重一点三八的情况下还是造成了井喷，油气压力约四百个大气压。根据现有资料判断，深油层深度大体在两千八百八十八公尺与两千九百零五公尺之间。这是在柴达木盆地找到的第一个深油层。
    开特米里克在去年还是个默默无闻的地方，除了黄色的沙丘以外，什么也看不到。今年，钻探工种的轻骑兵——“轻便钻井队”吹起了开发开特米里克的号角，并且很快就传出了喜讯。在4月29日钻达三十八公尺的时候就喷出了原油，5月5日钻达一百二十多公尺时又一次喷出原油。油藏离地面如此近，是空前的。根据化验，原油质量也很好。这是盆地今年石油勘探事业中的第二个胜利。
    油泉子是盆地建立最早的石油探区。在1955年年底，这里就给毛主席敬献了第一吨原油，是柴达木出油最早的地方。今年，这个探区又取得了很大的成就。第九号中深井在7月26日下午到27日上午，间歇性的喷出原油近三十立方公尺，喷射高达八公尺至十公尺。油色深绿，无水，质量很好。这证明了油藏面积比原来估计的扩大了。这口井位于构造的北翼，而过去估计油泉子构造仅仅只是顶部有油。油泉子今年还建立了柴达木第一个炼油厂。这个小型的炼油厂，今年计划生产三千吨石油。目下基建工程正在紧张进行，预计在国庆就可以投入生产。
    今年上半年盆地石油勘探事业的另一重大胜利，是油砂山新石油探区的建立。这里已钻的七口深井、中深井和浅井中，都发现了总厚度在一百公尺以上的油砂。砂岩疏松，渗透率高，证明油砂山构造油藏面广，油层多，是个很有希望的构造。说很有希望，根据还不限于上面一些。5月23日浅一井进行试油，在试采的十七个小时零四十分钟内，共产油一万六千公升，折合日产，每日最高产量是二十一吨。这是一个具有工业开采价值的含油构造，其特点是，“压力虽小，产量却高”。
    9月7日下午九时，青海普查大队中深一号钻机，在马海构造上，钻到四百七十四点七七公尺深的时候，钻孔里冒出原油。因为这个钻孔曾经遇到四次高压水层和一层气，钻机自始就是用重泥浆钻进的，所以原油没从井里喷出来。不过，从已经取出的三公尺的油砂岩心来看，证明这个构造是很好的油层。
    以上就是今年盆地石油勘探的简单情况。当广大人民了解到这些情况后，一定会无限振奋。那些反党反社会主义的右派先生们，也许会发抖哭泣，那就由他们去吧，事实永远是无情的。
