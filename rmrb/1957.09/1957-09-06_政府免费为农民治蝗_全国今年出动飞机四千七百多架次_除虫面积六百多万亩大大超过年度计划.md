Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 5th. The professional aviation team of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, based in Tianjin, conducted its final agricultural flight of the year on September 2nd. As of then, agricultural aircraft had flown 4,744 sorties this year, treating more than 6.11 million mu of land for pests, equivalent to 281% of the annual planned pest control area target.

This year, aircraft eradicated over 5.07 million mu of summer and autumn locusts in 28 locations in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Qinghai, and other provinces. The insecticidal efficiency was generally between 95% and 100%, while the average flying cost per mu was only 1 jiao. All expenses for aircraft locust control (including pesticide powder) were paid by the government. In the famous wheat and cotton producing areas of Xinxiang in Henan, Xiajin in Shandong, and Wuzhong and Jinji in Gansu, aircraft also helped farmers eliminate cotton bollworms and wheat thrips. Last year, the government funded aircraft to eliminate cotton bollworms in Xiajin, Shandong. Due to the high insecticidal efficiency, widespread bumper cotton harvests, and low flying costs, this year farmers in dozens of agricultural cooperatives in Xiajin County paid for aircraft themselves to eliminate cotton bollworms on approximately 200,000 mu of land.

    政府免费为农民治蝗
    全国今年出动飞机四千七百多架次
    除虫面积六百多万亩大大超过年度计划
    新华社天津5日电　设在天津的中国民用航空局专业航空队2日作了今年最后一次农业飞行。至此，今年农业飞机飞行了四千七百四十四架次，除虫面积达六百十一万多亩，相当年度计划规定的灭虫面积指标的281％。
    在河北、河南、山东、青海等省的二十八个地方，飞机今年扑灭了夏蝗和秋蝗五百零七万多亩，杀虫效率一般都在95％到100％，而平均每亩地飞行费用仅一角。飞机灭蝗的全部费用（包括药粉）都由政府支出。在著名的小麦和棉花产区的河南新乡、山东夏津和甘肃吴忠、金积等地，飞机还帮助农民消灭棉虫和小麦吸浆虫。山东夏津去年曾由政府出钱进行了飞机消灭棉虫的飞行，由于杀虫效率高、棉田普遍丰收和飞行成本低，今年夏津县几十个农业合作社的农民就自己出钱要飞机给他们消灭了棉虫约二十万亩。
