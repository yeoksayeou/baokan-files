Xinhua News Agency, September 15th. TASS reported on September 14th that the West German newspapers "Frankfurter Neue Presse" and "Frankfurter Rundschau" published on September 13th impudent campaign documents forged by Adenauer's campaign headquarters. This false document is presented in the form of a fabricated "record of a speech given by Party Secretary Khrushchev on February 6, 1957, in Moscow to the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of satellite countries."

The fabricators of the false document attempt to frighten deceived West German voters with the myth of so-called "Communist infiltration." They falsely claim that Khrushchev intends to "sabotage West Germany and its vast raw material and industrial potential."

The trick adopted by Adenauer's campaign headquarters is aimed at attacking those opposition parties that oppose West German remilitarization and oppose turning West Germany into a base for atomic war and a docile tool of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The fabricators of the false document published it on the eve of the election, hoping that their lies would not be refuted in time. However, this forged document is crudely and poorly fabricated and can only deceive those who wish to be deceived.

There is no doubt that the Soviet Union is faithful to its policy of respecting the sovereignty and independence of large and small countries and has never interfered and does not now interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. It also does not interfere in the current election campaign in the Federal Republic of Germany.

However, the leaders of Adenauer's campaign headquarters vainly hope that this policy of the Soviet state will enable them to shamelessly slander the Soviet Union and attribute all kinds of lies to the Soviet leaders.

This false document published in West Germany once again proves that the heads of the reviving German militarism will stop at nothing to achieve their goal of seizing power, and they want to lead the country onto an adventurous road that contains fatal dangers for the German people.

　　阿登纳竞选总部蒙蔽选民
　　伪造文件诬蔑苏联
　　塔斯社揭穿谎言和诡计
    新华社15日讯  塔斯社9月14日发表消息指出：西德“法兰克福新报”和“法兰克福评论报”9月13日刊载了阿登纳竞选总部伪造的无礼的竞选文件。这个假文件是以捏造的“党书记赫鲁晓夫1957年2月6日在莫斯科向卫星国共产党中央委员会发表的演说记录”形式提出的。
    伪文件的编造者企图用所谓“共产主义渗入”的神话来恫吓被蒙蔽的西德选民。他们妄说赫鲁晓夫打算“对西德及其巨大的原料和工业潜力进行破坏”。
    阿登纳竞选总部所采取的这种诡计，是为了打击那些反对西德重新军国主义化、反对把西德变成原子战争基地和北大西洋公约组织驯顺工具的反对党。
    伪文件编造者在选举前夕发表这个文件，是指望他们的谎言不会及时遭到驳斥。但是，这个伪造文件编造得很粗糙欠通，它只能欺骗那些愿受欺骗的人。
    毫无疑问，苏联忠实于尊重大小国家主权和独立的政策，它过去和现在从不干涉其他国家的内政。它对目前德意志联邦共和国进行的竞选斗争也不加以干涉。
    但是，阿登纳竞选总部的领导人徒然指望苏维埃国家的这个政策能够使得他们有可能恬不知耻地诽谤苏联和把各式各样谎言加在苏联领导人的身上。
    西德公布的这个假文件又一次证明：正在复活的德国军国主义的头目不惜用一切方法来达到掌握政权的目的，他们要把国家引向对德国人民包含着致命危险的冒险道路。
