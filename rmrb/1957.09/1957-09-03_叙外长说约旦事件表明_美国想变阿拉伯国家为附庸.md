Xinhua News Agency dispatch, September 2nd: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, in an interview with a reporter from "Italian Newspaper," pointed out that the Jordanian events of April this year demonstrate that the United States wants to turn Arab countries into colonialist vassal states.

Bitar expressed regret that Washington is following the path of imperialists. He said that American policies have aroused suspicion in Arab countries, and the Jordanian events have proved that these suspicions are well-founded. The unfortunate experiment carried out by the United States in this Arab kingdom has finally exposed the true face of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Belgrade, Yugoslav News Agency dispatch: Syrian Minister of State and Acting Defense Minister Azem told the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" that Syria hopes for peace, freedom, and independence, and it is making every effort for this.

He said, "Because we have declared such a policy, we have been maliciously condemned and attacked, saying that we have become a satellite state of a certain country. The West, mainly the United States, is constantly carrying out this attack, but we are continuing to implement our policy because we are deeply convinced that by doing so, we are serving peace and humanity." He emphasized that Syria is willing to resolutely defend these principles and national independence.

Damascus dispatch: Mahdi Kuba, chairman of the dissolved Iraqi Independence Party, issued a statement saying that the imperialist bloc's clamor about the Syrian events and the slander of so-called Syrian government aggression are the result of the imperialists' conspiracy falling apart.

Kuba pointed out that the active neutral policy resolutely pursued by the Syrian leaders is not only entirely in line with Syria's own interests but also with the interests of all Arabs, because this policy is necessary to defend all Arab people from invasion by insidious enemies.

Istanbul dispatch: U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson left Lebanon on September 1st and went to Istanbul, Turkey again to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Menderes. The Syrian newspaper "Al-Nour" reported that Henderson secretly visited Saudi Arabia and Israel during his visit to Lebanon to carry out activities against Syria.

Syrian newspapers believe that Henderson's mission has encountered many difficulties. One of these difficulties is that some pro-American Arab countries are showing hesitation in using military pressure and imposing economic blockades on Syria.

    叙外长说约旦事件表明
    美国想变阿拉伯国家为附庸
    本报综合报道  据新华社2日讯：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在对“意大利报”记者谈话时指出，今年4月间的约旦事件表明美国想把阿拉伯国家变为殖民主义者的附庸国。
    比塔尔对华盛顿遵循帝国主义者的道路这点表示遗憾。他说，美国的政策已经引起了阿拉伯国家的怀疑，而约旦事件就证明了这些怀疑是有根据的。美国在这个阿拉伯王国所进行的倒霉的试验，终于暴露了“艾森豪威尔主义”的真面目。
    据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：叙利亚国务部长兼代理国防部长阿泽姆对南斯拉夫“战斗报”发表谈话说，叙利亚希望和平、自由和独立，为此它进行了一切努力。
    他说，由于我们宣布了这样的政策，我们遭到了恶意的谴责和攻击，说我们成了某个国家的卫星国。西方，主要是美国，不停地进行这种攻击，但是，我们在继续执行我们的政策，因为我们深信，通过这种做法，我们在为和平和人类服务。他强调指出，叙利亚愿意坚决维护这些原则和国家的独立。
    据大马士革消息：已经被解散了的伊拉克独立党的主席马赫迪·库巴发表声明说，帝国主义集团关于叙利亚事件的叫嚣和所谓叙利亚政府侵略的诬蔑，是帝国主义者阴谋破产的结果。
    库巴指出，叙利亚领导人所坚决奉行的积极的中立政策不仅完全符合叙利亚本身的利益，而且符合全体阿拉伯人的利益，因为这个政策是保卫全体阿拉伯人民不受阴险的敌人侵犯所必需的。
    另据伊斯坦布尔消息：美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊9月1日离开黎巴嫩，再度到土耳其的伊斯坦布尔同土耳其总理曼德列斯会谈。叙利亚“光明报”报道，汉德逊在访问黎巴嫩期间曾经秘密访问过沙特阿拉伯和以色列，进行反对叙利亚的活动。
    叙利亚报纸认为，汉德逊的使命遇到很多困难。这些困难之一是：一些亲美的阿拉伯国家在对叙利亚使用军事压力和进行经济封锁问题上表现得很犹豫。
