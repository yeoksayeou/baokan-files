　　Eliminate Philistinism in Literary and Art Circles
　　He Luo
    More than twenty years ago, Lu Xun gave the following earnest advice to left-wing writers: "...to think that a poet or writer, now works for the laboring masses for the revolution, and in the future, after the revolution succeeds, the working class will definitely give generous rewards, special treatment, invite him to sit in a special-class car, eat special-class meals, or laborers will offer him buttered bread, saying: 'Our poet, please use it!' This is also incorrect." Why is it incorrect? Lu Xun believed that: (1) Revolution is a difficult undertaking, and after success, material conditions may still be difficult for a while. (2) The role of intellectuals "should not be particularly underestimated, but the working class has no obligation to give poets or writers special and exceptional treatment." How insightful these words are! How far-reaching the meaning! In fact, when the revolution had not yet achieved national victory, there were already a few literary and art workers in Yan'an who were singing for the Party in the hope of reward, and more than seven years after the founding of the country, there are still many similar phenomena. Perhaps beyond Mr. Lu Xun's expectations: to this day, certain writers, including old writers who have personally received his teachings, openly demand to be treated as important figures deserving of special treatment, and if they don't get their way, they are extremely dissatisfied with the Party, stirring up trouble, fearing that the world is not chaotic enough. What is going on? Li Youran said: "I want to kill people!" Chen Qixia said, "I want to set fires!" In addition to shouting grievances for Jiang Feng everywhere and complaining for Ding Ling, Ai Qing also shouted, "The Party is gloomy and terrifying!" "There is no warmth in the Party!" This is really strange.

    Upon closer inspection, it turns out that they are a group of "revolutionary" investors, a group of philistines. Their shares: some have written a book; some have written more than one. It is said that in these books, they have brought "love" to the people and "honor" to the Party. Therefore, they can ask for anything they want from the Party. What to take? What to seek? Some seek higher ranks and treatment; some seek "free" relationships between men and women; some want to be the overlords of the literary world; and the common effort is to compete with the Party for leadership on the literary and art front. If the Party does not satisfy them, then it is the so-called "gloomy darkness" and "no warmth." In their view, even if they break with the Party, it seems that the Party can do nothing to them. The "golden houses in books, jade-like beauties in books" sought by ordinary feudal literati seem to be inferior to the greedy desires of these gentlemen, because the latter's appetite is much greater than the former's!

    Here, we cannot help but take stock. Is it the Party and the people who owe these gentlemen, or is it these gentlemen who owe the Party and the people? If a writer or poet truly writes a good novel or a good poem from the standpoint of loving the people, the people will not hesitate to give the writer or poet many times more rewards in terms of material and spiritual aspects. And as long as what is written has immortal value, as long as the author is loyal to the people to the end, the people will give him love for generations. If modern progressive writers or poets think that the people's reward for them is entirely based on their own abilities and genius, and do not see the strength of the Party, then they are wrong. Because the Communist Party always painstakingly educates progressive writers and poets on how to love the broad masses of the people, and at the same time, it also educates the broad masses of the people on how to love progressive poets and writers. Especially after the national liberation, the Party has given writers all kinds of care and convenience. This is an undeniable fact, how can it still be denied? Unexpectedly, people like Ai Qing, the so-called "engineers of the soul," have become so ungrateful and put the cart before the horse, and do not understand at all what is called true warmth and what is called true honor. This is the how many chapter of confusion?

    I remember Mr. Lu Xun once said something like this: The motivations of revolutionaries are not exactly the same. In the revolutionary camp, in addition to the vast majority of people with great goals and dedication, there are also those who are for money; there are also those who are for power; there are also those who are for love; there are also those who are for suicide... Indeed, in the stage of democratic revolution, some losers in the old society and superficial humanitarians, although dissatisfied with the status quo at the time, also participated in the revolution, but always took themselves as the center and struggled for their personal future. Now these people regret joining the Communist Party and dislike the socialist ideological life, which I don't think is strange.

    I would like to advise all the anti-Party "heroes" and "good men" in the literary and art circles to honestly and quickly seek warmth and reform themselves under the loving care and education of the Party and the people, who "love others with virtue," and to regain the lost honor. If they insist on being philistines and want to pass the socialist barrier in this way, it is absolutely impossible.

### 清除文艺界的市侩主义

　　清除文艺界的市侩主义
　　何洛
    二十多年前，鲁迅对于左翼作家们，曾经提出过如下的忠告：“……以为诗人或文学家，现在为劳动大众革命，将来革命成功，劳动阶级一定从丰报酬，特别优待，请他坐特等车，吃特等饭，或者劳动者捧着牛油面包来献他，说：‘我们的诗人，请用吧！’这也是不正确的。”为什么不正确呢？鲁迅认为：（一）革命是艰苦的事业，成功后，物质条件一时恐怕还有困难。（二）知识分子的作用“不应特别看轻，然而劳动阶级决无特别例外地优待诗人或文学家的义务。”这些话讲得多么透辟！意义多么深远！事实上，当革命还没有取得全国胜利的时候，在延安就有少数的文艺工作者，已经向党弹铗而歌了，建国七年多的今天，仍然不乏这种类似的现象。也许出乎鲁迅先生意料之外：直到今天，某些作家，其中还包括有亲聆过他教益的老作家，竟公然要求把自己当做应受特殊待遇的大人物，不达目的，就对党异常不满，兴风作浪，唯恐天下不乱，这是怎么一回事呢？李又然说：“我要杀人！”陈企霞说“我要放火！”艾青除了到处为江丰喊冤，替丁玲诉苦而外，更叫嚷“党内阴森可怖！”“党内没有温暖！”这真是奇怪了。
    仔细一查，才知道他们原来是一批“革命”的投资者，一批市侩。他们的股份：有的写了一本书；有的写了一本以上。据说在这些书里面，他们是给人民带来了“爱”，给党带来了“荣誉”的。因此，他们尽可以向党予取予求。取什么？求什么？有人所取的是级别和待遇更高；有人所求的是“自由的”男女关系，有人所要的是作文坛的霸主；而共同努力的则是和党争文艺路线上的领导权。如果党不给他们以满足，那就是所谓的“阴森黑暗”，“没有温暖”。在他们看来，即使闹到决裂，好像党也是把他们莫可如何的。一般封建文人所企求的“书中自有黄金屋，书中自有颜如玉”，比起这些先生的贪婪欲望来，似乎尚有逊色，因为后者的胃口较之前者，更大得多啦！
    在这里，我们不禁要算一算账，究竟是党和人民有负于这些先生呢，还是这些先生有负于党和人民？一个作家或诗人，如果真是从爱人民的立场出发写出了一篇好小说或一首好诗，人民是不惜在物质方面，精神方面，给予作家或诗人以不知超过多少倍的酬报的。而且只要所写的东西具有不朽的价值，只要这个作者终身到底忠实于人民，人民就会世世代代都给予他以热爱。假使现代的进步作家或诗人，以为人民对他们的报偿，是完全靠自己的本领和天才，而看不见党的力量，那是错误的。因为共产党总是苦口婆心地既教育进步的作家和诗人怎样去爱广大的人民，同时，也教育广大的人民怎样去爱进步的诗人和作家。特别是在全国解放后，党给予了作家以各种各样的照顾和便利。这是有目共睹的事实，难道还能否认得了么？不想所谓“灵魂的工程师”的艾青等人竟至忘恩负义，本末倒置，压根就不懂得什么才叫做真正的温暖，才叫做真正的荣誉。这不知属于发昏第几章了。
    记得鲁迅先生大致又曾说过这样的话：革命者的动机是并不完全一样的。革命阵营内，除了绝大多数具有伟大目标和献身精神的人而外，也有的是为金钱；也有的是为权势；也有的是为爱情；也有的是为自杀；……的确，在民主革命的阶段，某些旧社会的失意者，浅薄的人道主义者，虽然不满于当时的现状，也参加了革命，但总是以自我作中心，为个人的前程而奋斗的。现在这些人后悔加入共产党，厌弃社会主义的思想生活，我以为并不足怪。
    奉劝一切文艺界的反党“英雄”们，“好汉”们，还是老老实实地，赶快在党和人民的“君子爱人以德”的关怀教育下，来寻找温暖，革面洗心，而挽回那已失的荣誉吧。如果他们定要作市侩主义者，并且想就这样过社会主义的关，那是决不可能的。
