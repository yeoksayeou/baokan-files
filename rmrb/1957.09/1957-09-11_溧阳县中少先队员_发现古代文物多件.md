　　Liyang County Middle School Young Pioneers
　　Discover Multiple Ancient Artifacts
    The Young Pioneers of Liyang County Middle School in Jiangsu Province found more than 20 kinds of ceramic shards and one stone arrowhead on the Tangwa Land of Xianren Mountain in Liyang, and handed them over to the government. After research by the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Culture and the Nanjing Museum, it was determined that the stone arrowhead (an ancient hunting tool) and the red sand coarse pottery were relics from the Neolithic Age, and the rest were geometric patterned hard pottery from the Warring States and Han Dynasties and yellow-glazed porcelain shards from the Tang Dynasty. The government sent two archaeological experts to Liyang for investigation. They said that Liyang and several nearby counties were a swampy area thousands of years ago, and a tribe lived here, but no Neolithic site had been discovered before. The experts will investigate Liyang, Jintan, and Gaochun counties for two months.

　　溧阳县中少先队员
　　发现古代文物多件
    江苏溧阳县中学少先队员在溧阳仙人山塘洼地上拾得二十多种陶瓷片和石镞一枚，送交政府。经江苏省文化局和南京博物院研究，认定石镞（古人狩猎石器）和红砂粗陶都是新石器时代的遗物，其余部分是战国汉代的几何印纹硬陶及唐代黄釉瓷片。政府派了两位考古专家到溧阳考察，他们说溧阳及附近几县在几千年前是个沼泽地带，有一支部落在这里生活过，但在这以前从未发现过新石器时代遗址。专家们将要在溧阳、金坛、高淳几县考察两个月。
