(Reported by this newspaper) An expanded meeting of the Party group of the Chinese Writers Association is continuing to conduct in-depth struggle against the Ding Ling-Chen Qixia anti-Party clique. At the meeting, a series of anti-Party words and deeds by Li Youran, a running dog of the Ding-Chen clique, were further exposed; and the anti-Party words and deeds of Ai Qing, Luo Feng, Bai Lang, and others were also exposed and criticized.

It was revealed at the meeting that the anti-Party relationship between Li Youran and Ding Ling and Chen Qixia has a long history. As early as 1942, they joined forces in Yan'an to carry out anti-Party activities.

In 1950, Li Youran came to Beijing from the Northeast. In 1951, Ding Ling placed him as a teacher at the Central Institute of Literature, which she presided over. Li Youran boasted about Ding Ling to everyone he met, and Ding Ling and Chen Qixia also touted Li Youran, who had only written a few essays in more than ten years, in the "Literary Gazette" they edited. In 1954, after Chen Qixia was disciplined by the Party for resisting the inspection of the "Literary Gazette's" errors by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Writers Association, Li Youran comforted and supported Chen Qixia in every possible way, and echoed each other in slandering the inspection. In 1955, during the purge of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, Li Youran openly expressed sympathy for Hu Feng's elements. During the anti-espionage movement, the Party investigated his history. He adopted a resistant attitude towards the Party's investigation and resolutely refused to sign the conclusion. The Party asked him to offer his opinions on the conclusion, but he did not offer any, but instead spread rumors to others that the Party was delaying in making a conclusion for him.

Before the Chinese Writers Association convened the summary meeting on the anti-espionage movement in 1956, Li Youran secretly planned with Chen Qixia on how to attack the Party at the meeting. Li Youran not only cooperated with Chen Qixia in attacking the anti-espionage movement, but also encouraged others to overturn their cases. The anti-communist wave that appeared internationally after the Hungarian incident gave them great encouragement. Li Youran said, "The time has come." He also said, "Ding Ling's eyes are filled with happiness." So they frantically counterattacked the Party. Li Youran even ran around to overturn the cases for Ding and Chen. Li Youran said to Chen Qixia, "I want to kill people!" Chen Qixia said, "I really want to set a fire!" Li Youran said, "I now realize the emotion in the line from 'Fighting the Fishing Family', 'To kill his whole family to eliminate the hatred in my heart!'" He clamored at the expanded meeting of the Party group of the Writers Association, "I hate! I hate!" He also said, "I regret participating in the revolution and joining the Party."

During the period of great blooming and contending, Li Youran roped in the rightist elements Tang Qi and Lü Jian of "Poetry Magazine" to overturn the cases for Ding and Chen. Lü Jian was a traitor who was expelled from the Party after liberation. Li Youran attempted to pull this traitor back into the Party and encouraged Lü Jian to overturn his case: "Your Party membership issue can be brought up again."

Li Youran said to Tang Qi, "You must protect the Party outside the Party. During the rectification, you must speak. The people's speeches have power." He also said, "Don't be lenient to them (referring to the Party)! This is a test, speak boldly, don't have any scruples."

Tang Qi and Lü Jian did indeed fiercely attack the Party at various rectification meetings, slandering the anti-espionage movement, and clamoring everywhere: "The lid of the Writers Association has not been lifted (referring to the Ding-Chen issue)." They also colluded with the rightist elements Mei Duo and Yao Fangzao of "Wenhui Daily" in an attempt to publicly reveal the Ding-Chen issue and use it to attack the Party's leadership. They and Li Youran often exchanged information about their attacks on the Party, congratulating each other on "victory." Li Youran also praised Tang Qi to others as "a sentinel standing at the door of the Party to protect the Party."

After the anti-rightist struggle began, Li Youran repeatedly instructed Tang Qi and Lü Jian: "Be calm! The anti-rightist struggle will pass, there won't be anything."

The reason why Li Youran hates the Party so much has its historical roots. From 1928 to 1932, he went to France and joined the Communist Party in France, but he soon voluntarily withdrew from the Party. According to him, at that time, he was very disappointed with the Third International and the Chinese branch of the French Communist Party, and completely sympathized with Trotsky, believing that Trotsky had "great merit" and was a "great genius," but was "excluded" and "attacked" in the Soviet Union. Li Youran said: "When I returned from Europe, I brought back sympathy for Trotskyists and disappointment with the Communist Party." And said: "After returning to China, if I joined a political party, I would join the Leninist Left Wing (referring to the Trotskyist organization)."

In 1932, Li Youran returned to Shanghai. Through the introduction of a Trotskyist element, he met the important Trotskyist element Wang Duqing. From then on, he had close ties with Trotskyist elements. He borrowed and read Trotskyist books from Trotskyist elements, and recommended them to others. At that time, he completely echoed the Trotskyist propaganda that undermined the Chinese revolution, spreading to people: "China can only carry out a proletarian revolution after complete industrialization." "Building socialism in one country is abandoning the world revolution" and other fallacies.

In 1941, after Li Youran went to Yan'an, he rejoined the Communist Party through the introduction of Ding Ling and Jiang Feng. However, his extremely reactionary thoughts were not transformed. He often spread anti-Party remarks and slandered the Party.

In 1942, Ding Ling published "Wild Lily Flower" written by the Trotskyist Wang Shiwei and her own "Thoughts on March 8th Festival" in the literary section of the "Liberation Daily," which she edited, viciously slandering the Party and the revolution. Li Youran greatly praised this. When struggling against Wang Shiwei, Li Youran expressed sympathy for Wang, not only going to "comfort" Wang Shiwei, but also openly exonerating Wang Shiwei, saying: "We understand Wang Shiwei. Wang Shiwei can be trusted. I was moved by Wang Shiwei's speech." Li Youran also mobilized his anti-Party good friend Xiao Jun to defend Wang Shiwei. At this time, Li Youran also wrote anti-Party articles, viciously attacking the Party. In his article "Lashing the Corpse," he slandered the revolutionary cadres in Yan'an, saying: "Marxism-Leninism is just a new set of clothes,...new uniforms, - new forms. In our hearts, we are still old, old habits, old content.... Many people get degrees, enjoyment, and rights from this." And said, this is "new form old content, this is a executioner, the bloody knife is inserted in the revolutionary scabbard."

The large number of facts revealed at the meeting show that Li Youran's bourgeois ideology and style have rotted to the core. One cannot smell the slightest bit of Communist Party member's flavor from him. He pulls and tugs, flatters and pats, and ropes in some people with similar smells to "talk about nothing serious." His praise and compliments to people have reached the point of making people feel sick. If you are a painter, he will say that you paint well; if you are a writer, he will say that you write well; if you are a young person, he will say that you have a future; if you are an elderly person, he will flatter you for being cultivated... In short, whatever you like to hear, he will say, everything is available, all kinds of goods are complete. In order to tout himself, he even shamelessly fabricated his own history, flaunting and deceiving. He has never been arrested by the enemy, but he fabricated out of thin air to the traitor Lü Jian: "I have lived in the Kuomintang's repentance院, and I have been tested. Some people write confession letters in the repentance院. There is nothing wrong with that, it can be understood, but I have never written one." His fabrication took care of the other party and touted himself.

His mind is full of ideas of fame and position, even reaching such an astonishing level: he is willing to act as a running dog of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, not taking it as a shame, but often saying to people: "I am a small person, and if a big event (referring to the Ding-Chen issue) falls on my head, I will become a big person."

He is a teacher at the Central Institute of Literature. He was asked to teach a course on French literature, but he refused. During his five years at the Literary Training Institute, he only barely taught ten lessons. In the past year, he has not taught a single lesson, but he receives a high salary every month. But he is not satisfied, and he is still fighting with the Party for rank and treatment.

### 效忠丁陈集团　鼓励右派进攻　宣扬托派理论  李又然是反党丑类的帮凶

    效忠丁陈集团　鼓励右派进攻　宣扬托派理论
    李又然是反党丑类的帮凶
    本报讯　中国作家协会党组扩大会议，仍在继续深入进行反对丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的斗争。会上，进一步揭露出丁、陈集团的走卒李又然一系列的反党言行；并对艾青、罗烽、白朗等的反党言行也作了揭露和批判。
    会上揭露：李又然和丁玲、陈企霞的反党关系是历史悠久的。早在1942年，他们在延安就结合起来进行反党活动。
    1950年，李又然从东北来到北京。1951年，丁玲就把他安插到她所主持的中央文学研究所作教员。李又然逢人便为丁玲吹嘘，丁玲和陈企霞也在他们主编的“文艺报”上，为这个十多年来只写了几篇杂感的李又然吹捧。1954年，陈企霞因抗拒中共中央宣传部、全国文联、中国作家协会对“文艺报”错误的检查，受了党的处分后，李又然百般安慰和支持陈企霞，并一唱一和污蔑这次检查。1955年，肃清胡风反革命集团时，李又然公开表示同情胡风分子。肃反运动中，党审查了他的历史。他对党的审查采取了抗拒态度，而且坚决拒绝在结论上签字。党让他对结论提出意见，他不提，却对别人造谣说：党拖延不给他做结论。
    1956年作家协会召开肃反总结大会前，李又然曾和陈企霞密谋在会上如何向党进攻。李又然不但配合陈企霞攻击肃反运动，并且鼓动别人翻案。匈牙利事件发生后，国际上出现的一股反共浪潮，给了他们很大鼓舞。李又然说：“时机到了。”又说：“丁玲的眼睛都充满了快乐。”于是他们就疯狂地向党反扑。李又然更到处奔走为丁、陈翻案。李又然对陈企霞说：“我要杀人！”陈企霞说：“我真想放火！”李又然说：“我现在才体会到‘打渔杀家’中的一句台词‘要杀他的全家，方消我的心头之恨！’的情绪。”他在作家协会党组扩大会上叫嚣着：“我仇恨！我仇恨！”又说：“我很后悔参加革命、入党。”
    大鸣大放期间，李又然拉拢“诗刊”的右派分子唐祈、吕剑为丁、陈翻案。吕剑是个叛徒，解放后被清洗出党了。李又然企图把这个叛徒重新拉进党内，鼓动吕剑翻案：“你的党籍问题，可以重新提出来。”
    李又然对唐祈说：“你要在党外保卫党，整风时，你要讲话，群众讲话有力量。”并说：“对他们（指党）不要容情！这是一次考验，要大胆讲，不要有顾虑。”
    唐祈、吕剑果然在整风的各种会议上，向党猛烈攻击，诬蔑肃反运动，并到处叫嚣：“作家协会的盖子未揭开（指丁、陈问题）。”他们并勾结“文汇报”的右派分子梅朵、姚芳藻企图公开丁、陈问题，借此攻击党的领导。他们和李又然经常交换向党进攻的情况，互相祝贺“胜利”，李又然并向别人夸奖唐祈是“站在党的门口保卫党的哨兵”。
    反右派斗争开始后，李又然再三叮嘱唐祈和吕剑：“要镇定！反右派斗争就会过去的，不会有什么的。”
    李又然所以如此仇恨党，是有他的历史根源的。他早在1928至1932年，曾到过法国，在法国参加了共产党，但是，不久就自动脱党了。据他自己说，当时，他对第三国际和法国共产党中国支部非常失望，完全同情托洛茨基，认为托洛茨基有“大功劳”，是“大天才”，但在苏联却受“排斥”和“打击”。李又然说：“我从欧洲回来，带回对托派的同情，带回对共产党的失望。”并说：“回国以后，如果参加政党，我就加入列宁主义左翼（即指托派组织）。”
    1932年，李又然回到上海，经一托派分子介绍，认识了重要托派分子王独清，从此和托派分子过从甚密，他从托派分子那里借阅托派的书籍，并向别人推荐传阅。当时，他完全附和托派破坏中国革命的宣传，向人传播：“中国只有全部工业化以后才能进行无产阶级革命。”“一国建设社会主义就是放弃世界革命”等谬论。
    1941年，李又然到延安后，经丁玲、江丰介绍，重新参加了共产党。但是，他的极端反动的思想并没有得到改造。他经常散布反党言论，对党进行诬蔑。
    1942年，丁玲在她主编的“解放日报”文艺版上发表了托派分子王实味写的“野百合花”，和她自己写的“三八节有感”，对党、对革命进行了恶毒的诽谤，李又然对此大加赞美。在斗争王实味的时候，李又然对王表示同情，不但去“慰问”王实味，并公然为王开脱说：“我们是了解王实味的，王实味是能相信的，王实味的发言我是感动的。”李又然还动员他的反党好朋友萧军为王实味辩护。就在这个时候，李又然也大写反党文章，恶毒地攻击党。在他的“鞭尸”一文中，他诬蔑延安的革命干部说：“马列主义只是一套新衣服，……新制服，——新形式。我们心里仍旧是旧的、旧习气、旧内容。……许多人以此得到学位、享受、权利”。并说，这是“新形式旧内容，这是刽子手，血污的刀插进在革命的刀鞘里。”
    会上揭露的大量事实说明，李又然的资产阶级思想和作风，已经腐烂透顶了，从他身上已经嗅不到一丝一毫的共产党员气味。他拉拉扯扯，吹吹拍拍，拉拢一些臭味相投的人，在一起“言不及义”。他对人的吹捧、恭维，到了使人肉麻的程度，你要是画家，他就说你画得好；你要是作家，他就说你写得好；你要是青年，他就说你有前途；你要是老年人，他就奉承你有修养，……总之，你喜欢听什么，他就说什么，应有尽有，百货俱全。他为了吹嘘自己，甚至无耻地编造一套自己的历史，招摇撞骗。他从来没有被敌人逮捕过，却无中生有地对叛徒吕剑说：“我住过国民党的反省院，受过考验，有些人在反省院里写自首书，这没有什么，是可以体谅的，不过我没有写过。”他的编造既照顾了对方，又吹嘘了自己。
    他满脑子的名位思想，甚至达到这样惊人的程度：他甘愿充当丁、陈反党集团的走卒，不以此为耻，反而经常对人说：“我是一个小人物，大事件（指丁、陈问题）落在我头上，我就变成大人物了。”
    他是中央文学研究所的教员，让他讲法国文学的课，他却拒绝不讲。他在文学讲习所五年期间，只勉强上了十课。最近一年来，他一课也不上，却每月领取高额薪金。但他还不满足，还向党争级别、争待遇。
