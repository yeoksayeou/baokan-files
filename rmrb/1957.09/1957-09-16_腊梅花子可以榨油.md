Winter sweet seeds can be pressed for oil.
The Shagwo District Grain Management Office in Qianxi County, Guizhou Province, successfully tested the use of wild winter sweet seeds to press oil in late July (the pressing method is the same as for castor seeds). The oil extraction rate in the first experiment reached 22%. The oil quality is similar to tung oil. Winter sweet is a wild plant, and the Shagwo District alone can purchase nearly 10,000 jin each year.

    腊梅花子可以榨油
    贵州省黔西县沙窝区粮食管理所，于7月下旬试用野生植物腊梅花子榨油成功（榨法与蓖麻子同）。第一次试验出油率达22％。油质与桐油差不多。腊梅花是野生植物，仅沙窝区每年即可收购近万斤。
