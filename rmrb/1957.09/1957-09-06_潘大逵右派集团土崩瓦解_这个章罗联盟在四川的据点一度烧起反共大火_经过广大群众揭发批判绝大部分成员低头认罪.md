Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 5th: The Pan Dakui Rightist Group, the "stronghold" of the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji alliance in Sichuan Province, has now completely collapsed. In the recent ten days or so, at the rectification forums of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress and the Sichuan Provincial Committee and Chengdu Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, after the exposure and criticism by representatives, members of the League, and the broad masses, the vast majority of members of this rightist group had to admit their crimes of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism, and expressed their willingness to bow their heads and confess their guilt.

The Pan Dakui Rightist Group was the main organizer and commander of the rightist elements in various parts of Sichuan who attacked the Communist Party this time. The head of this rightist group was Pan Dakui, member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee, Fan Puzhai and Zhang Zhihe, members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Xian Ying was their representative in Beijing; the core backbone members of the group were Zhao Yiming, deputy secretary-general of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Zhang Songtao, secretary-director of the Provincial Committee and Chengdu Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and Li Kang and Shu Jun in Chongqing; the backbone members of this group included Han Wenwei, Liu Kunnan, Luo Zhongxin, Zeng Shufan, Zhang Xueyan, Hu Kelin, and Feng Kexi. The small group members within the China Democratic League and government agencies included Zhang Shengming, Yang Shanfu, Yang Dagang, Yang Junming, and Jiang Wenqin. The agents of this group at the grassroots level included Luo Xiling, Yang Zhinong, Liu Shiyi, Zhang Mosheng, Xing Shitong, Huang Dacheng, Zhang Zehou, Zhang Yongyan, and others.

According to revelations, under the direct arrangements of the Zhang-Luo alliance, Pan Dakui and others carried out a series of instigation work among the broad masses of League members and the intellectuals they contacted. Pan Dakui, Zhao Yiming, Zhang Songtao and others once gathered the rightist elements of the League from various cities and counties, such as Zhang Mosheng, Liu Shiyi, and Luo Xiling, for private talks, and secretly conveyed Zhang and Luo's estimates of the situation and the purpose and requirements of the "blooming and contending." Pan Dakui, Zhao Yiming and others said, "The Communist Party is still afraid of strikes and class boycotts, and dare not use the army to suppress them if something happens. Scholars can still rebel, and if intellectuals make trouble, the Communist Party can make concessions." "In the future, the status of democratic parties will change, and candidates for premier, vice premier, minister, and vice minister can be proposed." Pan Dakui also instructed these rightist elements to go back and "release" opinions on "a bicameral system," "political design institute," "rehabilitation," "the Party's world," "the Party replacing the government," "the Party committee system in schools," and so on, and instigated them by saying, "Now it's time to see your skills!" After a series of ideological mobilizations and organizational deployments, the backbone members of the Pan Dakui group went to the grassroots level and ignited a raging fire of frantic attacks on the Communist Party and socialism. This "fire" started from Chengdu and Chongqing and spread to cities and counties such as Ya'an, Nanchong, Neijiang, Zigong, Luzhou, Yibin, Mianyang, Suining, and Xichang; this "fire" burned to departments such as universities, government agencies, middle schools, primary schools, literary and artistic institutions, as well as among social intellectuals. Under the instigation of Pan Dakui, Zhao Yiming, and others, rightist elements from Sichuan Agricultural College, such as Yang Zhinong, chairman of the China Democratic League branch, fabricated the so-called "relocation of the college issue," incited students of the Agricultural College to cause trouble, monitored the Communist Party's vice president, detained and interrogated working cadres of the Ya'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, and beat the secretary of the Ya'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the president of the Ya'an Municipal People's Court who went to find out the situation; at the same time, they also shouted the reactionary slogan of "opposing the highest authority - the State Council", gathered crowds to surround the Ya'an Railway Station, and attempted to cause trouble in Chengdu.

The revealed materials show that the Pan Dakui group conducted organizational activities in both open and secret ways. The open way was to use legal forms to carry out illegal activities. For example, they used various meetings of the China Democratic League to convey the private goods of the Zhang-Luo alliance; they used various contacts at work to implement their reactionary propositions; they used the promotion and transfer of cadres to win over some people and squeeze out others. The secret way was to carry out collusion and organizational activities through private contacts. They often used daily life contacts such as visiting friends, drinking tea, farewell banquets, watching operas, and touring mountains to talk "private words." For example, in Chengdu, there were so-called "Wenshu Monastery tea parties," "Wuhou Temple suburban outings," and "Wuyi Lane meetings"; in Chongqing, there were so-called "Nanquan secret talks" and "West Suburb Park consultations," and so on. They even started fixed "tea parties," "dinners," and "rotating meetings" as organizational forms for attracting and contacting people. They also adopted some forms of "making friends through literature," such as talking about teaching, talking about literature and art, looking at calligraphy and paintings, and writing old poems, to contact some like-minded intellectuals. They used these activities to spread anti-Communist ideas, exchange anti-Communist intelligence, and plan anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies. Their requirement for developing the League organization was "the more the better, the faster the better."

After the exposure of these conspiratorial activities by the masses, the majority of the rightist elements in this group were forced to bow their heads and confess their guilt, and some people are still continuing to confess. So far, this "stronghold" of the Zhang-Luo alliance—the Pan Dakui Rightist Group—has collapsed completely.

    潘大逵右派集团土崩瓦解
    这个章罗联盟在四川的据点一度烧起反共大火  经过广大群众揭发批判绝大部分成员低头认罪
    据新华社成都5日电　章伯钧—罗隆基联盟在四川省的“据点”潘大逵右派集团现在已经全线崩溃。最近十多天来，在四川省人民代表大会和民盟四川省委、成都市委的整风座谈会上，经过代表们、盟员们和广大群众的揭露和批判，这个右派集团的绝大部分成员都不得不承认了自己反共反社会主义的罪行，表示低头认罪。
    潘大逵右派集团是这一次四川各地右派分子向共产党进攻主要的组织者和指挥者。这个右派集团的首脑是民盟中央委员、四川省主任委员潘大逵，民盟中央委员范朴斋、张志和；鲜英是他们驻北京的代表；集团核心骨干分子是民盟四川省委员会副秘书长赵一明、民盟省委兼成都市委秘书主任张松涛和重庆的李康、舒军；这个集团的骨干分子有韩文畦、刘堃南、罗忠信、曾庶凡、张雪岩、胡克林、冯克熙。这个集团在民盟和机关内部的小集团分子有张声明、杨善辅、杨达纲、阳俊明、蒋文钦。这个集团在基层的代理人有罗西玲、杨志农、刘石夷、张默生、邢世同、黄大成、张泽厚、张永言等。
    据揭露，在章罗联盟的直接布置下，潘大逵等向广大盟员及所联系的知识分子进行了一系列的煽动工作。潘大逵、赵一明、张松涛等曾约集各市县盟的右派分子张默生、刘石夷、罗西玲等个别密谈，暗中传达了章罗关于形势的估计和鸣放的目的、要求。潘大逵、赵一明等曾说：“共产党还是怕罢工罢课，出了事不敢用军队镇压。秀才还是可以造反的，知识分子闹起来，共产党就可以让步。”“将来民主党派地位要变，可以提出总理、副总理、部长、副部长人选。”潘大逵还指示这些右派分子回去要“放”“两院制”、“政治设计院”、“平反”、“党天下”、“以党代政”、“学校党委制”等等，并且大肆煽动说：“这一下就要看你们的本事了！”经过一系列思想鼓动和组织部署后，潘大逵集团的骨干分子就下到基层点起了向共产党向社会主义猖狂进攻的大火。这场 “火”从成都、重庆烧起，一直烧到雅安、南充、内江、自贡、泸州、宜宾、绵阳、遂宁、西昌等市、县；这场“火”烧到了高等学校、政府机关、中学、小学、文艺机构等部门以及社会知识分子中间。在潘大逵、赵一明等策动下，四川农学院右派分子、民盟支部主任委员杨志农等制造了所谓“迁院问题”，煽动农学院的学生闹事，监视共产党员副院长，扣押并审讯中共雅安地委的工作干部，打了前去了解情况的中共雅安市委书记和雅安市人民法院院长；同时还喊出了“反对最高机关——国务院”的反动口号，聚众包围雅安车站，企图闹到成都去。
    揭露出来的材料说明，潘大逵集团进行组织活动的方式方法有公开的一套，也有秘密的一套。公开的是利用合法形式进行非法活动。例如，利用民盟的各种会议，传达章罗联盟的私货；利用工作上的各种接触，贯彻他们的反动主张；利用干部的升迁调动，争取一些人，排挤一些人。秘密的则是通过私下的接触，进行串联组织活动。他们经常利用访友、喝茶、饯行、看戏、游山等日常生活上的接触谈“私房话”。例如，在成都有所谓“文殊院茶会”、“武侯祠郊游”、“乌衣巷会议”；在重庆有所谓“南泉密谈”、“西郊公园会商”等等。他们甚至还搞起固定的“茶会”、“聚餐会”、“转转会”等，作为拉拢人、联络人的组织形式。他们还采取了一些“以文会友”的形式，例如谈教学，谈文艺，看字画，做旧诗等来联络一些气味相投的知识分子。他们利用这些活动，在其中传播反共思想，交换反共情报，筹划反共反社会主义的阴谋。他们对发展盟组织的要求是“越多越好，越快越好”。
    这些阴谋活动经过群众的揭露后，这个右派集团中的大多数人都被迫低头认罪，有些人还在继续交代。至此，章罗联盟的这个“据点”——潘大逵右派集团便告土崩瓦解，全线崩溃。
