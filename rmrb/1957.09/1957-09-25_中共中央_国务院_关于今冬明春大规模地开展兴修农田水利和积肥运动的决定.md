    The vigorous and extensive construction of farmland water conservancy is the most effective fundamental measure to expand agricultural production, increase yield per unit area, and prevent and control drought and flood disasters. Accumulating more fertilizer and applying more fertilizer are reliable ways to ensure increased production. In order to better meet the arrival of the Second Five-Year Plan and realize the need for further development of agricultural production, we must concentrate our efforts this winter to launch a large-scale farmland water conservancy construction campaign and manure accumulation work. This movement should become a major component of the production upsurge that follows the current upsurge of socialist education in rural areas. In order to smoothly organize and guide this movement, the Central Committee and the State Council believe that:

    I. It is necessary to comprehensively summarize the experiences and lessons of the past few years, especially during the water conservancy construction upsurges in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956. We should first affirm that the achievements of the water conservancy construction upsurges in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956 were significant, expanding the irrigated area by 100 million mu. We must continue to carry forward this achievement. We must use vivid facts of significant production increases due to water conservancy construction to explain to cadres and the masses the necessity of developing water conservancy construction, the favorable conditions after cooperation, and how to work hard to overcome difficulties. Special attention should be paid to summarizing and introducing existing advanced experiences, commending labor models, boosting morale, and enhancing confidence. We must summon up the same kind of energy as in the upsurge of the winter of 1955. At the same time, the shortcomings in past movements must also be appropriately pointed out. The main shortcomings during the upsurges of the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956 were: in some areas, the numbers in the water conservancy task plans were somewhat too large, not sufficiently integrated with agricultural and sideline production at the time, and in some places, there was insufficient consultation with the local masses, leading to certain phenomena of coercion and commandism. Secondly, there was insufficient diversity of projects and adaptation to local conditions. Some places emphasized the uniformity of projects, such as excessively emphasizing well-digging and setting rigid plans. In addition, there was insufficient specific guidance for the water conservancy construction movement at that time, and timely summarization and promotion of advanced experiences and correction of shortcomings were inadequate, which led to waste of labor and aroused dissatisfaction among the masses in some places. These shortcomings should be avoided as much as possible in future movements.

    II. Based on the favorable characteristics of China's farmland water conservancy conditions, we must earnestly implement the policy of focusing on small-scale projects, supplementing with medium-sized projects, and constructing large-scale projects when necessary and possible. In the construction of projects, we must also pay attention to mastering the principles of giving equal importance to consolidation and development, giving equal importance to construction and management, giving equal importance to quantity and quality, relying on the masses, adapting to local conditions, studying history, diversifying approaches, investing less, and achieving quick results. Existing water conservancy facilities should be actively repaired and expanded, strengthened management, potential tapped, and benefits fully realized. In areas with severe waterlogging disasters or soil erosion, drainage and waterlogging removal or soil and water conservation work should be given top priority. Rural hydropower work should be combined with water conservancy construction, with a focus on pilot projects. In areas with suitable conditions, it should be actively developed to gradually meet the needs of necessary mechanical irrigation. In pastoral areas, attention should be paid to gradually solving the problem of drinking water for people and livestock.

    The various planned targets for farmland water conservancy in 1958 have been separately issued by the Ministry of Water Conservancy. Provinces and below also need to issue control figures at each level, but do not set them too rigidly, and allow necessary revisions to be made below. The water conservancy plans of agricultural cooperatives must be discussed and decided by the cooperatives. When formulating and implementing plans, we must oppose both conservatism and setting excessively large plans. The main task at present is to first oppose conservative thinking.

    III. Strengthen leadership. Experience has shown that leadership attention and the personal involvement of responsible party and government comrades are major keys to carrying out work. Party and government leading organs at all levels should promptly issue instructions based on the instructions of higher authorities and local conditions, and conduct in-depth mobilization among cadres and the masses. Work guidance should include both general appeals and specific guidance, relying on key areas to promote overall progress, timely inspection, summarizing experience, and solving problems. County-level water conservancy agencies should be appropriately strengthened and supplemented based on work needs.

    IV. Based on different conditions and existing experience in various regions, do a good job in water conservancy construction planning. Ensure that irrigation and drainage, flood control and drought prevention, medium and small-scale projects, and large-scale projects can all be adapted to local conditions and unified in arrangement. Provinces and autonomous regions should actively carry out planning for medium and small river basins and regional farmland water conservancy planning, so that the two can check and integrate with each other. This planning should also pay attention to coordination with relevant plans for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and animal husbandry. Cooperatives should also formulate water conservancy plans as an integral part of the overall agricultural production plan. Water conservancy planning at all levels can adopt a method of proceeding from rough to fine, first making a general outline plan, and then gradually enriching, revising, and making more practical and detailed plans in the work. At present, attention should be paid to not allowing incomplete planning to affect the progress of work.

    V. Correctly implement relevant policies on farmland water conservancy. In order to encourage cooperative members to actively participate in capital construction, the remuneration for water conservancy work points should be equivalent to the remuneration for agricultural work points for the same amount of labor. This remuneration should be distributed in the same year for projects that benefit in the same year; for those that do not benefit in the same year, either distribute profits in the same year or distribute profits gradually in subsequent years, as determined by local conditions. According to the winter production conditions in various regions, attention should be paid to rationally arranging labor. Ensure both winter agricultural and sideline production and the needs of capital construction to expand reproduction. Based on this principle, appropriately stipulate the proportion of work that members should contribute in these two areas, so as to fully utilize the labor force during the slack winter season. For projects involving more than one cooperative, mutual support should be implemented, adhering to the principle of benefiting more and contributing more labor. In areas with mutual assistance habits, some voluntary labor can also be contributed, but food should be subsidized. The remaining construction labor used by the state can also be used for water conservancy construction. Provinces and autonomous regions can also formulate some necessary reward measures and convene water conservancy labor model meetings to encourage the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses to build water conservancy projects.

    VI. Strengthen technical guidance. Various regions should continue to adopt the method of "taking the construction site as a school and the project as a textbook" to actively train peasant water conservancy technicians. Old peasants and experienced masters who have experience in water conservancy construction in rural areas should be used well, their opinions respected, learned from, and attention should be paid to cultivating and improving them. Each province and autonomous region should delegate or temporarily transfer a group of technical cadres to grassroots units below the county level to be responsible for technical guidance work such as surveying, design, and construction, to ensure construction quality and construction safety.

    VII. Well work. Well irrigation accounts for a large proportion in various provinces in North China. In the past few years, many wells have been dug, which have also played a great role in increasing production and fighting drought. In the future, it is still necessary to continue to actively develop in appropriate areas. However, in the two upsurges of water conservancy construction in 1952 and 1956, some areas' well-digging work showed some blindness, disregarding regions and conditions, focusing only on quantity and neglecting the shortcomings of quality and efficiency. This shortcoming must be prevented and corrected. The development of well irrigation must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner according to terrain and water source conditions. At the same time, technical guidance must be strengthened, and more wells with good quality and large water output must be dug. Shallow wells and semi-finished wells should continue to be renovated, and work such as leveling land, configuring water lifting tools, and imparting irrigation technology should be followed up to ensure timely benefits.

    VIII. Resolve and prevent water conservancy disputes. All regions should earnestly implement the relevant instructions of the Central Committee and the "Report on Handling Opinions on Water Use and Drainage Disputes" approved and forwarded by the State Council. It is necessary to emphasize consciously abiding by discipline. Units and personnel with serious departmentalism who fail to implement agreements and decisions of higher authorities, thereby causing serious losses, should be subject to appropriate punishment. At the same time, we must be vigilant against bad elements using water conservancy disputes to carry out provocative sabotage activities. Counties and counties, special zones and special zones, provinces and provinces bordering each other and other areas where water conservancy disputes may occur should do a good job of ideological education for cadres and the masses in advance, give play to the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual concession, advocate taking care of the overall situation, overcome departmentalism, consult with each other, strive to avoid the occurrence of disputes and ensure timely handling.

    IX. Water conservancy funds. Regardless of the size of the project, we should earnestly implement the spirit of building water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily, spending less money and doing more things. Mass farmland water conservancy mainly relies on the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of cooperatives, and encourages members to actively invest. The state can only provide necessary subsidies. Water conservancy funds for 1958 have been appropriately increased and attention should be paid to saving and preventing waste. The use of subsidies should first give appropriate consideration to mountainous areas, ethnic minority areas, old revolutionary base areas, and disaster areas.

    X. Material preparation. The materials for constructing the project should rely on the masses and take materials locally. As for the materials that must be purchased and allocated, such as cement, steel, water lifting tools, mechanical and electrical equipment, as well as palm bark, hemp rope, lead wire, steel pipes, and coal for burning bricks for well-digging, etc., should be carefully calculated and plans should be submitted in a timely manner. Relevant departments of the central government and local governments should actively support and supply them in a timely manner.

    XI. While building farmland water conservancy, we must also vigorously launch the winter manure accumulation campaign. This is also a fundamental measure to achieve increased agricultural production. Party and government leading organs at all levels must lead agricultural societies in various places to formulate feasible manure accumulation and fertilizer production plans, adopt all effective methods and policies to encourage active fertilizer production, mobilize the masses, and ensure that they are realized on schedule.

    XII. Carrying out afforestation is closely related to soil and water conservation and the protection of farmland water conservancy. All regions must seize the season and take necessary steps to do a good job in afforestation this winter and next spring, while ensuring both quantity and quality.

    Winter and spring are the most favorable seasons for carrying out farmland water conservancy and manure accumulation work. One of the main reasons why the 1957 plan was not completed well was that it started late and missed the construction season, which should be taken as a lesson. In order to ensure the victory of the farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaign this winter and next spring, all regions should immediately start preparations and actively carry them out. Provinces and autonomous regions should report the progress to the Central Committee and the State Council at any time.

    中共中央　国务院
    关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定
    积极广泛地兴修农田水利，是扩大农业生产，提高单位产量，防治旱涝灾害最有效的一项根本措施。多积肥，多施肥，是保证增产的可靠办法。为了更好地迎接第二个五年计划的到来，实现进一步发展农业生产的需要，我们一定要在今年冬季，集中大力开展一个大规模的农田水利建设运动和积肥工作。这个运动，应该成为随着目前农村社会主义教育高潮而来的生产高潮的主要组成部分。为了顺利地组织和指导这个运动，中央和国务院认为：
    一，必须全面总结过去几年来，特别是1955年冬季和1956年春季水利建设高潮时期的经验教训。应该首先肯定1955年冬季和1956年春季的兴修水利高潮，成绩是很大的，扩大了灌溉面积一亿亩。我们要继续发扬这种成绩。要用生动的由于兴修水利而显著增产的事实，向干部和群众说明发展水利建设的必要性，说明合作化后的有利条件和如何努力克服困难。特别要注意总结和介绍已有的先进经验，表扬劳动模范，鼓舞士气，提高信心，要鼓起像1955年冬季高潮中那样一股劲头来。同时，对于过去运动中的缺点，也必须适当地指出。1955年冬和1956年春高潮时期的缺点主要是：在规定水利任务计划时，有些地区数字偏大一些，与当时的农、副业生产结合不够，有些地方未充分与当地群众协商，有过某些强迫命令的现象。其次是工程多样性和因地制宜不够，有些地方强调工程的单一化，如过份强调打井，计划定得过死等。此外，对当时的兴修水利运动的具体指导不足，及时总结推广先进经验和纠正缺点不够，因而有些地方曾经产生了浪费劳力，引起群众不满的现象。这些缺点，在今后运动中，应该尽力避免。
    二，根据我国农田水利条件的有利特点，必须切实贯彻执行小型为主，中型为辅，必要和可能的条件下兴修大型工程的水利建设方针。在工程的兴建上，还必须注意掌握巩固与发展并重，兴建与管理并重，数量与质量并重，依靠群众，因地制宜，研究历史，多种多样，投资少，收效快等等原则。对已有的水利设施，应该积极整修和扩建，加强管理，挖掘潜力，充分发挥效益。在内涝灾害或者水土流失严重的地区，应该把排水除涝或者水土保持工作，放在首要地位。农村水电工作应结合水利建设，重点试办，在有条件的地区应该积极发展，做到逐步满足必要的机械灌溉的需要。在牧区应该注意逐步解决人、畜饮水问题。
    关于1958年的农田水利各项计划指标，已由水利部另行下达。省以下也需要逐级下达控制数字，但不要规定太死，应允许下面作必要修订。农业合作社的水利计划，必须经过合作社讨论决定。在制定和执行计划的时候，既要反对保守，也不要把计划定得过大，当前主要的还是首先要反对保守思想。
    三，要加强领导。经验证明，领导重视，党政负责同志亲自动手，是开展工作的一个主要关键。各级党政领导机关，应该根据上级指示和当地条件，及时发布指示，在干部和群众中，进行深入动员。工作指导上既要有一般号召，更要有具体指导，依靠重点，推动全面，及时检查，总结经验，解决问题。县一级水利机构，应该根据工作需要，适当地充实加强。
    四，要根据各地不同条件和现有经验，做好水利建设规划。务使灌溉与除涝、防洪与防旱、中、小型与大型，都能够做到因地制宜，统一安排。各省、自治区应该积极进行中、小河流域规划和地区的农田水利规划，使两者互相校核，互相结合。这种规划还应该注意与农、林、渔、牧等有关规划相配合。合作社也应该制定水利规划，作为整个农业生产规划的一个组成部分。各级的水利规划，均可采取由粗到精的办法，先作出一个大体轮廓规划，再在工作中逐步充实修正，作出更切实详尽的规划。目前要注意不要因为规划不完整而影响工作的进行。
    五，要正确地贯彻执行农田水利的有关政策。为了鼓励合作社社员积极参加基本建设，水利工分的报酬应该相当于同等劳动力农业工分的报酬。这种报酬，如工程当年受益者，应该在当年分红；当年不能受益者，或者当年分红或者以后逐年分红，由各地根据具体情况决定。要根据各地冬季生产条件，注意合理安排劳力。既要保证冬季的农、副业生产，又要保证为了扩大再生产的基本建设的需要。根据这个原则，适当地规定社员在这两方面应该出工的比例，做到能够充分利用冬闲季节的劳动力。在涉及一个合作社以上的工程，应该实行互相支援，实行受益多少、出工多少的原则，在有互助习惯的地区，还可以出一部分义务工，但应该补助伙食。用之于国家的剩余建勤工，也可用之于兴修水利。各省、自治区还可以制定一些必要的奖励办法和召开水利劳模会议，以鼓励干部和群众兴修水利的积极性。
    六，加强技术指导。各地应该继续采取“以工地为学校、以工程为教材”的方式，积极培训农民水利技术员。对农村中兴修水利有经验的老农和老师傅，要很好的使用，尊重他们的意见，向他们学习，并且注意培养提高他们。各省、自治区均应该下放或临时抽调一批技术干部，到县以下的基层单位，负责进行勘测、设计、施工等技术指导工作，以保证施工质量和施工安全。
    七，水井工作。华北各省水井灌溉占有很大的比重。过去几年来打了不少的井，也起到了很大的增产和抗旱作用。今后在适当的地区还必须继续积极发展。但是，在1952年和1956年两次兴修水利的高潮中，有些地区的打井工作，曾出现某些盲目性，不顾地区和条件，只重数量，忽视质量和效益的缺点。这个缺点必须注意防止与纠正。发展井灌，一定要根据地形、水源条件，有计划有步骤地进行，同时要加强技术指导，多打质量好、出水大的井。对浅井、半成井仍应该继续进行改造，并要使平整土地、配置提水工具、传授浇地技术等工作跟上去，保证及时受益。
    八，解决与防止水利纠纷。各地应该认真贯彻执行中央的有关指示和国务院批转的“水利部关于用水排水纠纷处理意见的报告”。要强调自觉地遵守纪律，凡是本位主义严重、不按协议和上级裁决执行、因而造成了严重损失的单位和人员，应该受到相当处分。同时，要警惕坏人利用水利纠纷进行挑拨煽动的破坏活动。县与县，专区与专区，省与省交界及其他可能发生水利纠纷的地区，应该于事先做好干部与群众的思想教育工作，发挥互助互让精神，提倡照顾整体，克服本位思想，彼此协商，力求避免纠纷的发生并且保证及时处理。
    九，水利经费。工程不论大小，都应该认真贯彻勤俭办水利的精神，少花钱，多办事。群众性的农田水利，主要是依靠合作社的人力、物力、财力，并且鼓励社员积极投资，国家只能作必要的补助。1958年水利经费已有适当增加，应该注意节约，防止浪费。补助费的使用，对于山区、少数民族地区、老根据地和灾区，应该首先予以适当照顾。
    十，器材准备。修建工程的器材，应该依靠群众，就地取材。至于必须采购调配的物料，如水泥、钢材、提水工具、机电器材以及打井用的棕皮、麻绳、铅丝、钢管、烧砖用煤等，均应该精打细算，及时提出计划。中央和地方的有关部门要积极支持，及时供应。
    十一，在兴修农田水利的同时，必须同样地大力展开冬季积肥运动。这也是实现农业增产的一项根本措施。各地党政领导机关，必须领导各地农业社，制定可行的积肥造肥计划，采取一切有效的办法和鼓励积极造肥的政策，动员群众，保证如期实现。
    十二，开展造林运动，对于水土保持和保护农田水利关系甚为密切。各地务须抓紧季节，采取必要步骤，在同时保证数量和质量的条件下，做好今冬明春的造林工作。
    冬、春两季是开展农田水利和积肥工作最有利的季节。1957年计划完成的不够好，主要原因之一就是动手晚，错过了兴修季节，应该引为教训。为了保证今冬明春兴修农田水利和积肥运动的胜利，各地应立即动手准备，积极进行。各省、自治区应将进行情况，随时报告中央和国务院。
                1957年9月24日
