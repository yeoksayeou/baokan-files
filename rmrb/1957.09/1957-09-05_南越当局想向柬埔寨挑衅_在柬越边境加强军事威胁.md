Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, September 3rd: "Cambodia Telegraph" reported today that since 1956, the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique has intensified military deployments in areas facing the Cambodian border provinces of Svay Rieng, Kampong Cham, Kampot, Kratie, and Stung Treng.

According to the newspaper, the South Vietnamese authorities have recently established eleven military strongholds in these areas, with these strongholds only three kilometers or even two hundred meters away from the Cambodian border. In addition, a large military base, planned to house 60,000 troops, is under construction. The South Vietnamese authorities have also built an airport and some strategic highways and bridges near the border of Cambodia's Kampot Province.

The newspaper pointed out that previously, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique had repeatedly violated the Cambodian border. Cambodian newspapers have accused the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of carrying out conspiracies under the direction of the United States, attempting to subvert the Cambodian government, which pursues a policy of peace and neutrality.

    南越当局想向柬埔寨挑衅
    在柬越边境加强军事威胁
    据新华社金边3日电“柬埔寨电讯报”今天报道，南越吴庭艳集团自从1956年以来，在面对柬埔寨的柴桢、磅湛、唝吥、桔井、波梦勉等边境省份的地带加强了军事部署。
    据这家报纸报道，南越当局最近在这些地区建立了十一个军事据点，这些据点离柬埔寨边界只有三公里甚至只有二百公尺。此外，一个预定要配置六万名军队的大军事基地正在修建中。南越当局在靠近柬埔寨唝吥省的边境还修建了一个飞机场以及一些战略性的公路和桥梁。
    报纸指出，在此以前，吴庭艳集团屡次侵犯过柬埔寨的边境。柬埔寨的报纸曾经指责吴庭艳集团在美国的指使下进行阴谋活动，企图颠覆执行和平中立政策的柬埔寨政府。
