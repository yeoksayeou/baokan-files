Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th. The true form of Chen Xue Zhao, a rightist element within the Communist Party, has been fully exposed in a series of forums held by Party members and non-Party members in Zhejiang's literary and art circles in recent days.

    The materials revealed at the meeting prove that Chen Xue Zhao is an insidious and vicious class alien element. Chen Xue Zhao slandered the Party as a factionalist group that engages in political maneuvering, vying for power and profit, and excluding dissidents. She described the Party, which represents the interests of the people, as a ruling class high above the masses.

    Chen Xue Zhao frequently colluded with Party rightist elements, Zheng Boyong, Secretary-General of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Cao Xiangqu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, forming a small clique, squeezing out the original Party responsible persons of the Federation, and echoing internally and externally with rightist element Song Yunbin, in order to usurp the Party's leadership over literary and art work.

    After the full blooming and free contending began, this anti-Party female writer believed the time had come, and actively wrote articles and participated in various forums, launching a massive attack on the Party. In her anti-Party words and deeds, like other rightist elements, she denied the achievements of literary and art work under the leadership of the Party, fabricated and exaggerated the shortcomings of the Party, and did everything possible to slander the Party. She believed that the Provincial Party Committee was a "lid," that she had the Provincial Party Committee's "golden hoop" on her head, and that she was constantly hit with "blunt sticks" by the Provincial Party Committee, etc.

    Attendees analyzed in detail why Chen Xue Zhao, an old Party writer, would degenerate into a bourgeois rightist element. It turned out that Chen Xue Zhao grew up in a declining bourgeois family and had long been educated in bourgeois ideas of "selfishness and disregard for others." After joining the Party, she often used writing as an excuse to avoid organizational life and refused ideological remolding. Therefore, although she had been a Party member for a long time, her bourgeois individualism remained untouched, and she used this perspective to view the Party, believing that the Party was also an individualistic group. She described the Party's organizational principles as "determined by personal likes and dislikes" and viewed promotions within the Party as "bestowing official titles and increasing ranks."

    Attendees criticized Chen Xue Zhao's anti-Party remarks made during the period of full blooming and free contending. At the forum of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, translator Xu Tianhong used his painful experiences in the old society to powerfully refute Chen Xue Zhao's argument in the interview "A Period of Warm Weather Followed by Cold Weather and Rain," published in the Wenhui Daily on May 18. In that interview, Chen Xue Zhao said: "In Zhejiang, everything is still so difficult, simply a thousand difficulties, ten thousand difficulties!" Xu Tianhong believed that describing the new society as so full of difficulties, even more difficult than living in the old society, was truly the most vicious incitement.

    Attendees also pointed out that Chen Xue Zhao often slandered the Party for not valuing literature and art, and for not valuing an old Party writer like her. In reality, the Party and the people had given her positions such as member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, vice-chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and other positions.

    Attendees also used a large number of facts to expose Chen Xue Zhao's self-proclaimed "integrity," "not wanting to be an official," and "not seeking wealth and fame," fully exposing her ugly face of bourgeois individualism seeking fame and profit. Chen Xue Zhao was very dissatisfied with her current status and treatment, and often complained to people, saying: "In the central government, I had the treatment of a prefectural committee secretary, but when I came to Zhejiang, I became a prefectural committee member." She also said to Cao Xiangqu: "If my works often meet with readers, my position will be consolidated."

    Attendees also pointed out that Chen Xue Zhao, as a Communist Party member, acted as an anti-communist propagandist. She often colluded with small group members and some people who were dissatisfied with the Party to go to her home, wantonly scolding and slandering the Party leadership. Her home became a nest for spreading capitalist toxins.

    After being exposed and criticized by the masses, Chen Xue Zhao has now begun to bow her head and confess her crimes, admitting that she is a complete rightist element within the Party, and has indicated that she will further make a comprehensive confession.

    反党言行证明资产阶级思想原封未动
    陈学昭是个党内阶级异己分子
    她在被揭发的大量事实面前低头认罪
    据新华社杭州9日电　共产党内右派分子陈学昭的原形，已在这几天浙江省文艺界党内外召开的一系列座谈会上被充分揭露出来。
    会上揭露的材料证明，陈学昭是一个阴险狠毒的阶级异己分子。陈学昭污蔑党是一个玩弄权术、争权夺利、排斥异己的宗派集团。她把代表人民群众利益的党形容成为一个高高在上的统治阶级。
    陈学昭经常和党内右派分子、省文联秘书长郑伯永和省政协副秘书长曹湘渠拉拉扯扯，形成一个小集团，把文联原有党员负责人排挤出去，和右派分子宋云彬内外呼应，以达到篡夺党对文艺工作的领导权。
    大放大鸣开始后，这位反党女作家认为时机已到，就积极写文章和参加各种座谈会，向党大肆攻击，在她的反党言行中，和其他右派分子一样，否定党领导下的文艺工作的成绩，制造和夸大党的缺点，对党极尽污蔑之能事。她认为省委是“盖子”、她的头上有省委的“金箍”，而且处处挨省委的“闷棍”等等。
    到会者详尽地分析了陈学昭那样一个党员老作家，为什么会堕落成资产阶级右派分子的原因。原来陈学昭生长在一个没落资产阶级的家庭里，又长期在国外受着资产阶级“人不为己、天诛地灭”的思想教育，入党以后，她又经常借口写作，不愿过组织生活，拒绝思想改造。因此，虽然她入党时间很长，但她的资产阶级个人主义思想却原封未动，并用这种观点来看党，认为党也是一个个人主义的集团。她把党的组织原则说成是“个人好恶所决定”，把党内的提级看成是“封官加爵”。
    到会者对陈学昭在大放大鸣期间发表的反党言论进行了批驳。在省文联的座谈会上，翻译家许天虹用自己在旧社会的痛苦遭遇，有力地驳斥了陈学昭发表在5月18日文汇报上“乍暖还寒晴复雨”访问记中的论调。陈学昭在那篇访问记中说：“在浙江，一切都还是那么难，简直是千难，万难！”许天虹认为把新社会说得那样千难万难，比在旧社会生活还难，真是最恶毒的煽动。
    到会者还指出，陈学昭经常污蔑党不重视文艺，不重视像她那样一个党员老作家。实际上，党和人民让她担任了全国政协委员、浙江省文联副主席等职位。
    到会者还用大量事实揭穿了陈学昭自诩为“清高”、“不想做官”、“不求富贵名利”等等，把她一副资产阶级个人主义要名要利的丑恶嘴脸充分揭露出来。陈学昭十分不满她现在的地位和待遇，时常对人发牢骚说：“在中央我是地委书记待遇，到了浙江就变成地委委员的待遇”。她还对曹湘渠说“作品经常和读者见面，地位就巩固了。”
    到会者又指出，陈学昭身为共产党员，却充当了反共宣传员。她经常串连小集团分子和一些对党不满分子到她家里去，恣意谩骂、诽谤党的领导。她的家成了传播资本主义毒素的巢穴。
    经群众揭露和批判，现在陈学昭已开始低头认罪，承认她是一个十足的党内右派分子，并且表示将进一步作全面的交代。
