Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 27th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru has expressed his disapproval of Japan's proposal to establish an Asian Development Fund.

Nehru made these remarks yesterday during a conversation with Japanese reporters about his upcoming visit to Japan.

Nehru said that many Southeast Asian countries have already joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, and are already receiving military assistance from the United States. Given this, why is an Asian Development Fund necessary? He further stated that Indonesia and Burma, which have not joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, are in great need of assistance, and many Asian countries are facing difficulties. But why should they be linked to any particular fund?

Nehru believes that bilateral agreements are better. He cited the United Nations Special Fund for Economic Development as an example, and pointed out that many countries wanted to participate, but the United States rejected their requests. Nehru revealed that his talks with Nobusuke Kishi will be informal. He said that in addition to the relations between India and Japan and international issues, he especially hoped to discuss issues related to China. "I have repeatedly said that China should be within the United Nations. China and Japan are neighbors. The two countries should treat each other as brothers and treat each other as good neighbors."

On September 25, Nehru, speaking at a gathering organized by the India-Japan Friendship Association here, advocated that Asian neighbors should be frank and open with each other.

    尼赫鲁访日前发表谈话
    不赞成设置亚洲开发基金
    主张亚洲邻国应该坦白相见
    据新华社新德里27日电　印度总理尼赫鲁表示不赞成日本所提出的关于设置亚洲开发基金的建议。
    尼赫鲁是在昨天同日本记者谈他最近要到日本访问一事的时候说这番话的。
    尼赫鲁说，东南亚许多国家都已经参加东南亚条约和巴格达条约，已经在接受美国的军事援助。既然如此，何必要亚洲开发基金呢？他又说，没有参加东南亚条约的印度尼西亚和缅甸是十分需要援助的，亚洲许多国家都有困难。但是何必把它们同任何一种特别的基金联系起来呢？
    尼赫鲁认为，双边协定是比较好的。他举出联合国经济发展特别基金为例子，并且指出，许多国家希望参加，但是美国拒绝了它们的要求。尼赫鲁透露，他同岸信介的会谈将是非正式的。他说，除了印度同日本的关系以及国际问题以外，他还特别希望讨论有关中国的问题。“我曾经一再说，中国应该在联合国之内。中国和日本是邻国。两国应该以兄弟相待，以善邻相待。”
    9月25日，尼赫鲁在这里印日友好协会所组织的一次集会上讲话的时候曾经主张亚洲邻国应该坦白相见。
