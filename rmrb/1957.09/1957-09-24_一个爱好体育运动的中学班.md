A Middle School Class That Loves Sports
　　Shi Yuzhong

　　“Every year on Labor Day and National Day, we put on our bright sportswear, wave our colorful rattan hoops, and gloriously and joyfully pass through Tiananmen Square to be reviewed by Chairman Mao, amidst the slogans ‘Build up our bodies to defend the motherland’ and ‘Build up our bodies to construct the motherland’… This year's National Day, many students in our class will also participate in the parade…” The girls in Class Four of the Senior Third Grade at Beijing No. 12 Girls' Middle School couldn't contain their joy, eagerly telling me about their glorious experiences.

　　Healthy bodies, excellent athletic skills, and good academic performance have enabled them to be selected into the ranks of the sports army in every great festival, representing all of China's athletes, to go to Tiananmen Square to be reviewed by the great leader.

　　How did these girls achieve the ordinary but proud title of "healthy body"? This afternoon, they were doing physical exercises on the playground. At first, they ran lightly in an orderly manner. After running three or four hundred meters, they stopped and switched to freehand exercises, with movements progressing from slow to fast, from simple to complex. This alone tells you that this is a team with exercise experience. After the warm-up exercises were completed, they divided into three groups, taking turns doing long jump, mat work, and vaulting horse activities.

　　A wooden horse, about two feet high, straddled the ground. More than a dozen girls, like flowing water, one after another vaulted over to the other side of the horse in a squatting position. Every time someone jumped over, the two students who were protecting would quickly point out: "Your abdomen is not fully extended," or "Your legs are swinging very high, very good"... They corrected each other again and again like this. Soon, every small rosy face was covered with bright beads of sweat. The dozen or so people active on the mats were sometimes doing continuous rolls, sometimes doing handstands, and sometimes making graceful "swallow balances." Their teacher, Mr. Wei, told me that this exercise method not only enhances students' interest but also maintains sufficient exercise volume.

　　In addition to such extracurricular activities, they also use the time in the morning and during class breaks to regularly engage in various running, gymnastics, and games, never interrupting their exercise. Last year, in the snowy winter, the whole class also organized a symbolic long-distance exercise of "circling the border of the country once." Under the guidance of the physical education research group, they also frequently conduct competitions with other classes in basketball, volleyball, racing, push-ups, and other activities.

　　Regular exercise has gradually improved their athletic skills. Among the fifty students, twenty-five have passed the first-level labor-defense system, and twenty-five have applied for the second-level labor-defense system test. At last year's school sports meet, their class won the first place in the team total score. In this year's Beijing Gymnastics Individual Championship and National Swimming Championships, students from their class won places.

　　Regular physical exercise has brought them healthy bodies and good athletic skills, as well as excellent academic performance, joy, and glory.

　　Now, while studying hard, they are stepping up their practice of rattan hoop exercises, preparing to walk towards Tiananmen Square on National Day with their shapely postures and skilled athletic techniques.

    一个爱好体育运动的中学班
    施毓忠
    “每年的劳动节和国庆节，我们都穿上鲜艳的运动服，挥舞着五彩的藤圈，在‘锻炼身体，保卫祖国’，‘锻炼身体，建设祖国’的口号声中，光荣愉快地经过了天安门接受毛主席的检阅……今年的国庆节，我们班许多同学，还要去参加游行……”北京市第十二女子中学高中三年级第四班的女孩子们，无法抑制住内心的喜悦，争先恐后地对我述说她们光荣的经历。
    健康的身体、优良的运动技术和学习成绩，使得她们在每一个伟大的节日都被选入了体育大军的队伍，代表着全中国的运动员，到天安门去接受伟大领袖的检阅。
    这些女孩子是怎样取得了“身体健康”这个平凡可又值得骄傲的称号呢？这天下午，她们正在操场上进行体育锻炼。起初她们是有秩序地轻轻地跑着步，跑了三、四百公尺后，停下来改做徒手体操，动作由慢而快，由简单而复杂，仅仅这一点就使你知道这是一支有锻炼经验的队伍。等到准备活动做完后，她们分作三个小组轮换着进行跳远、垫上、跳马三种活动。
    一只两尺来高的木马横跨在地上，十几个姑娘，好像流水一般地一个接着一个以蹲腾越的姿势跳过了马的那边，每跳过一人，作保护的那两个同学总是很快地指出：“你的腹部没有充分挺开”或者“你的腿摆得很高，很好”……就这样她们一次又一次地相互纠正。一会儿每张红润的小脸都沾满了明亮的汗珠。活跃在垫子上的那十几个人，她们有时作连续的滚翻，有时做着倒立动作，有时则作出优美的“燕式平衡”。她们的魏老师告诉我，这种锻炼方法不但能提高同学的兴趣，而且保持着足够的运动量。
    除了这样的课外活动外，她们还利用早晨和课间休息的时间，经常地进行着各种跑步、体操和游戏，一直没有间断过锻炼。去年在大雪纷飞的冬日里，全班还组织了象征性的“环绕国境一周”的长途锻炼。在体育教研组的指导下，她们还经常和别班同学进行篮排球、赛跑、俯卧撑等比赛。
    经常的锻炼，使得她们的运动技术逐渐提高，在五十个同学当中，有二十五个人通过了一级劳卫制，二十五个人申请了二级劳卫制的测验。在去年的全校运动会上，她们班获得了团体总分第一名，在今年举行的北京市体操单项冠军赛和全国游泳锦标赛中，她们班都有同学获得了名次。
    经常的体育锻炼，给她们带来了健康的身体和良好的运动技术，也带来了优良的学习成绩、愉快和光荣。
    现在，她们在紧张学习的同时，正在加紧练习藤圈操，准备在国庆节那天，带着健美的姿势、熟练的运动技巧走向天安门。
