Big-Character Posters at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Mo
　　We went to see the big-character posters at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. The two long rows of reed mats erected temporarily were already covered with them. The walls inside and outside the dining hall and everywhere in the courtyard had become gardens of big-character posters. Some of the ink was not yet dry, some were already tattered, with one layer covering another. Zhao Changhe, the secretary of the Communist Youth League committee, who led us around, said that the plant had only been carrying out rectification for about twenty days, but more than two thousand big-character posters had already been produced. At its peak, more than three hundred posters were produced in a single day, and sometimes the people looking at the big-character posters were like attending a temple fair.
　　It was dinner time, and the workers, holding their bowls, were clustered in groups of three or five, eating, watching, and discussing. A newly posted cartoon at the entrance of the cafeteria attracted many people. A young man clapped his hands and shouted, "Hey, it's drawn really well! We should ask our factory director to come and see it." "You don't need to ask, he's already here, look, aren't the factory leaders all there!" another joked. It turned out that it depicted an accident in the assembly workshop, with injured workers lying on the ground. A group of Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders from the factory rushed over, followed hurriedly by doctors. Next to it were written two lines: "They don't come when nothing happens, but when something does, they come in droves." The workers felt that this cartoon powerfully expressed their voices and insisted that our accompanying photographer take a picture of it.
　　On those walls and courtyards full of various big-character posters, it is not difficult to find such powerful criticisms. The employees used big-character posters to attack all kinds of bureaucratic styles, irresponsibility, and waste of state property, such as procrastination and buck-passing in their work. Zhang Zhicheng of the assembly workshop criticized the factory's leading cadres for using "research, research" to procrastinate and perfunctorily deal with many things. Li Jinke of the equipment section criticized a certain factory director for quibbling over trivial matters. Zhao Fuxiang, the workshop director, loudly called for tracing the root causes of buck-passing in many links. Many veteran workers pointed out that the large organization and excessive number of management personnel caused chaos in production. Chen Baoshan, an old worker in the assembly workshop, said: Our workshop's scraping section is the most chaotic, and the main reason for the chaos is that there are too many section chiefs who cannot solve the main problems. Some duty section chiefs can only help workers find tools and parts. You look for them, and he looks for them, but the parts problem is still not solved.
　　According to preliminary statistics, employees throughout the factory have put forward more than eight thousand nine hundred suggestions through big-character posters and various discussion meetings. These suggestions involve every corner of the factory. Some of these suggestions had been repeatedly put forward in the past. But in the past, only a few people knew about them when they were raised in small groups, and many suggestions were "digested" after being passed up level by level; some were transferred to the parties concerned, but were delayed or ignored for a long time. Now, by posting them in big-character posters and making them public, everyone knows about them, and discussions and criticisms by all employees throughout the factory form a huge power. Many problems that had been delayed for a long time and were mutually pushed off in the past have now been quickly resolved after being posted on big-character posters. In the past, when manufacturing machine tools, a kind of pointer part was processed, because the technical design was inappropriate, it was labor-intensive and material-consuming. The workers in the workshop had raised this issue for three or four years in a row, but no one in the technical section paid attention to it. This time, the workers posted it in a big-character poster, and the technical section sent someone to study it and solved it in less than two days. A batch of work processed by the machining workshop for other factories was delayed for half a year without acceptance due to some minor issues. The workers who did the work could not get their wages, and the other factories were anxious to use them. This time, the big-character poster was posted on the first day, and it was accepted the next day. The workers increasingly feel that big-character posters are a very powerful weapon for carrying out criticism and self-criticism and promoting work. If anyone is found to be delaying work or failing to correct mistakes, people will remind him: "What, do you want people to post a big-character poster about you?" (Attached picture)

    北京第一机床厂的大字报
    本报记者　林沫
    我们去参观北京第一机床厂的大字报。那临时搭成的两道长长的芦席墙已经给贴满了，饭厅内外和院里四处的墙壁上都成了大字报的园地，有的墨迹未干，有的已经残破，一层盖着一层。带领我们参观的团委书记赵长和同志说，厂里开展整风不过二十来天，大字报已出了两千多张，最多时一天出过三百多张，看大字报的人有时简直像赶庙会一样。
    这时正是吃晚饭的时候，工人们端着碗，三五一堆地围在那里，边吃边看边谈论。新贴在食堂门口的一张漫画吸引了许多人，有个小伙子拍手喊着：“嘿，画的真棒！该请咱们厂长来看看。”“不请就来了，你看，厂的领导人不都在上面么！”另一个打趣地说。原来上面画的是：装配车间出了事故，受伤的工人倒在地上，厂里党、政、工、团的领导人跑来一群，后边慌忙赶来的是医生。旁边写着两行字：“无事不来，出事一来成排”。工人们觉得这幅漫画有力地表达了他们的呼声，一定拉着我们同来的摄影记者给拍了照。
    在那满墙满院各色各样的大字报上，像这样有力的批评是不难找到的。职工们用大字报对工作中的推拖、扯皮等各式各样的官僚主义作风、不负责任和浪费国家财产的现象进行攻击。装配车间张志诚批评厂的领导干部对许多事都是以“研究研究”来推拖搪塞；设备科李金柯批评某厂长一点小事也扯皮；车间主任赵福祥大声疾呼要追查许多环节扯皮的根源。许多老工人提出，由于机构庞大，管理人员过多，给生产造成混乱。装配车间老工人陈宝善说：我们车间最乱的刮研段，乱的主要原因是段长太多，又不能解决主要问题，有的值班段长只能帮助工人找工具，找零件，你也找，他也找，零件问题还是解决不了。
    据初步统计，全厂职工通过大字报和各种座谈会，共提出了八千九百多条意见，这些意见涉及到全厂的各个角落。其中有些意见，过去也有人一再提出过。但过去在小组里提只有少数人知道，而且有很多意见，经过逐级转上去，就被“消化”完了；有的转到当事人那里，被长期拖延或置之不理。现在用大字报贴出来，公诸于众，人人皆知，全厂职工谈论批判，就形成一种巨大的威力。有许多问题，过去长期扯皮，互相推拖，现在上了大字报，很快就得到了解决。过去制造车床时加工的一种指针零件，因为技术设计不适当，作起来费工又费料，对这问题，车间的工人一连提了三、四年，技术科也没人理。这次工人用大字报贴出来，技术科派专人研究，不两天就解决了。加工车间给外厂加工的一批活，因为一些小问题扯皮，做出来堆在那里半年也不验收，作活的工人拿不到工资，外厂着急用不上。这次头天贴出大字报，第二天就验收了。工人们日益感到，大字报是进行批评与自我批评和推动工作的一种极为有力的武器，如果遇到什么人工作拖延，有错不改，人们会提醒他说：“怎么样，你想让人给你贴张大字报吗？”（附图片）
