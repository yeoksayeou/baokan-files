    Four Hundred Thousand Workers Receive Socialist Education
    Jilin Workers' Political Life Unprecedentedly Active
    Provincial Party Committee Arranges In-Depth Two-Roads Debate

    (Our Newspaper Reporter Chen Ji reports) More than 400,000 workers in Jilin Province have initially received socialist education. Industrial cities such as Changchun, Jilin, Liaoyuan, and Siping, and enterprises in areas such as Tonghua, Baicheng, Yanbian, and Gongzhuling have held multiple meetings to discuss the current domestic political situation and the major tasks of the working class. Workers in some factories and mines have also discussed the relationship between the individual and the collective, production development and living improvement, and democracy and centralism, in light of the specific circumstances of their units, clarifying some confused ideas among some workers.

    This socialist education mainly focuses on counterattacking the rightists. Many factories and mines have used the rightists in their units and regions as negative teachers to educate workers to raise their class consciousness and bravely defend the socialist cause. Most factory and mine workers have listened to three or four reports on the anti-rightist struggle. Many workers spontaneously sent representatives to reason with the rightists face to face. Workers at the First Automobile Factory once went to universities and colleges to debate with the rightists. More than 200 workers in Dalai County wrote letters of determination, expressing their determination to fight the rightists to the end. Employees of the Siping Railway Station wrote 700 letters questioning the rightists. Some temporary workers and family members of workers also actively participated in the anti-rightist struggle and received education. Refuting the fallacies of the rightists has become the daily topic of conversation among the masses of workers. Workers' political life is unprecedentedly active, and their class consciousness has been significantly improved.

    Workers in some factories and mines held debates and wrote blackboard newspapers to discuss some internal issues of the enterprise. Some focused on discussing the relationship between production and life, while others focused on issues such as observing labor discipline and cherishing state property. In this discussion, veteran workers took the lead as teachers and tutors, presiding over seminars and giving lectures to new workers. This educational method has been very effective. When Shiren Coal Mine discussed the issue of improving living standards, many veteran workers gave lessons to new workers and took them to see the "Mountain of Blood and Tears" and the "Morgue" before liberation. Veteran worker Yin Desheng pointed to the "Mountain of Blood and Tears" and said to the new workers: "Before liberation, workers who froze to death, died of illness, or starved to death were piled up in the morgue. Only when 40 corpses were collected were they sent to the 'Mountain of Blood and Tears'. Corpses covered corpses on the 'Mountain of Blood and Tears', where were the coffins and graves? My father's body has not been found to this day. Today, our workers have the care of the Party and labor insurance benefits and are no longer treated like animals. We are the masters of our own affairs, so why do some people still put forward excessive demands for living standards?" Many new workers immediately reviewed their past mistakes of demanding wages and welfare. When workers at the First Automobile Factory and the Siping Machinery Factory No. 1 discussed the issue of dormitories, some veteran workers said, "How could we have lived in family dormitories before liberation? We stood by the boiler during the day and had to secretly sleep by the boiler at night!" This discussion educated the masses of workers and correctly resolved some internal contradictions within the enterprise. When the Yanbian Paper Mill convened its first workers' representative conference, proposals from workers on living welfare issues accounted for 30% of all proposals; recently, when the second workers' representative conference was convened, the workers said: "Let's have a good discussion about production work and stop dwelling on living welfare issues." Some welfare issues that cannot be resolved at present are no longer raised. Some workers in newly built factories examined their shortcomings in not observing labor discipline and pretending to be sick to avoid work, and resolved to learn from the good qualities of veteran workers in strictly observing discipline.

    At present, the work of carrying out socialist education for workers throughout the province is not deep or widespread enough. Some units only make reports and do not conduct discussions; a few units have not yet carried out socialist education for workers. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China have recently held meetings and decided that, on the basis of socialist education in the anti-rightist struggle, a large-scale socialist debate should be launched in depth and extensively, and all workers should be mobilized to participate. The main content of the debate is the debate on the two roads. Through the debate, all workers, especially new workers, will be able to recognize the major issues of right and wrong, further raise their socialist awareness, rectify their work style, and consolidate their ranks. On the basis of clarifying the major issues of right and wrong ideologically, some of the workers' own problems (such as the relationship between improving living standards and developing production, democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, and the individual and the state) will be resolved. In mines and forestry areas, the relationship between workers and peasants, and the relationship between urban and rural areas, will also be debated. According to existing experience, in the debate, the leadership of the Party should be strengthened, the mass line should be implemented, and Party members, Youth League members, veteran workers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and conscious new workers should be relied upon. Through this large-scale debate, the socialist education of the masses of workers will be further expanded, and the leading position of the working class in the country's political life will be consolidated.

    四十万职工受到社会主义教育
    吉林职工政治生活空前活跃
    省委布置深入开展两条道路的大辩论
    本报讯  本报记者陈迹报道：吉林省四十多万职工已经初步受到了一次社会主义教育。长春、吉林、辽源、四平等工业城市和通化、白城、延边、公主岭等地区的企业都举行过多次会议，讨论了当前国内政治形势和工人阶级的重大任务。部分厂矿的工人还联系本单位具体情况，讨论了关于个人和集体、生产发展和生活改善、民主和集中等方面的关系问题，澄清了部分工人中的一些糊涂观念。
    这种社会主义教育，主要以反击右派为中心内容。不少厂矿都把本单位本地区的右派分子当作反面的教员，教育工人提高阶级觉悟，奋勇保卫社会主义事业。多数厂矿的工人都听了三、四次反右派斗争的报告。许多工人自发地派出代表，找右派分子当面说理。第一汽车厂工人曾经到高等学校，找右派分子辩论。大赉县二百多名工人写出决心书，表示要同右派分子斗争到底。四平车站职工写了七百多封信，质问右派分子。一些临时工和工人家属，也积极参加反右派斗争，受到了教育。反驳右派分子的谬论，已经成为目前工人群众日常谈话的主题。工人们的政治生活空前活跃，阶级觉悟显著提高。
    部分厂矿的工人举行辩论会，写黑板报，讨论了企业内部的一些问题。有的着重讨论生产和生活之间的关系问题，有的着重讨论遵守劳动纪律、爱护国家财产等问题。在这种讨论中，老工人带头当教员、辅导员，主持座谈会，给新工人上大课。这种教育方法收效很大。石人煤矿在讨论生活改善问题的时候，许多老工人给新工人上课，还带领新工人去看解放前的血泪山和死人仓库。老工人尹德胜指着血泪山对新工人说：“解放前工人冻死、病死、饿死，都堆在死人仓库里，等凑到四十具尸体时才送上血泪山。血泪山上尸体盖尸体，哪来棺材、坟墓？我父亲的尸体，到如今也没有找着。今天我们工人有党的关怀，有劳保待遇，再也不当马牛了。我们当家作主，为什么有些人还提出过高的生活要求呢？”不少新工人当时就检讨了过去闹工资、闹福利等错误。第一汽车厂和四平机械一厂工人讨论宿舍问题的时候，有的老工人说，咱们解放前哪能住上家属宿舍？咱们白天站在锅炉旁，夜晚还得偷偷睡在锅炉旁！这种讨论，教育了工人群众，也正确解决了一些企业内部的矛盾。延边造纸厂召开第一届职工代表大会的时候，职工们提出的有关生活福利问题的提案占全部提案的30％；最近召开第二届职工代表大会，职工们说：好好讨论生产工作吧，别再纠缠生活福利问题了。一些目前不能解决的福利问题，都没有人再提出来。有些新建工厂的工人检查不遵守劳动纪律、装病不上班等缺点，决心要学习老工人严守纪律的好品质。
    目前，全省对工人进行社会主义教育的工作还不够深入和广泛。有些单位只作报告，不进行讨论；少数单位还没有向工人进行社会主义教育。中共吉林省委、中共长春市委和中共吉林市委最近都召开会议，决定要在反右派斗争的社会主义教育的基础上，深入地广泛地展开社会主义大辩论，要发动全体工人参加。大辩论的内容主要是两条道路的辩论。通过辩论，使全体工人特别是新工人认清大是大非，进一步提高社会主义觉悟，整顿作风，整顿队伍。在辩明大是大非的思想基础上，解决工人群众的一些切身问题（如生活改善和生产发展、民主和集中、自由和纪律、个人和国家的关系等问题）。在矿山和林区还要辩论工农关系、城乡关系等问题。根据已有的经验，在辩论中要加强党的领导，贯彻群众路线，依靠党团员、老工人、转业复员军人和有觉悟的新工人。通过这种大辩论，进一步展开工人群众的社会主义教育工作，巩固工人阶级在国家政治生活中的领导地位。
