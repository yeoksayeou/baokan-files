Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: Syrian Minister of State for Information and Propaganda Affairs, Akil, told reporters on the 8th that the US claim of Communist infiltration into Syria "is an excuse for the US to attempt to interfere in Syria's internal affairs and prepare for aggression against Syria."

Commenting on Dulles' statement on the situation in Syria, Akil said that the people, government, and army of Syria "are unanimously determined to cope with everything that may happen."

On the same day, Syrian Army Chief of Staff Bizri told a reporter from the Egyptian "Al Akhbar" that the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson's recent report in Washington that the situation in Syria is dangerous is only true for the imperialists.

He refuted the imperialist propaganda that there is conflict between the Syrian army and the government, saying, "This is unfounded. We are one country, one government, and one army here."

Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party leader Akram Hourani called in "Al-Rai" to "be vigilant against any American adventurism and strengthen preparations to deal with it."

According to the Syrian News Agency, a delegation from Aleppo, an important city in northern Syria, presented to the Syrian President, Speaker of Parliament, Prime Minister, and cabinet members on September 8 a petition signed by more than 17,000 people, condemning recent American conspiracies.

The petition also stated, we salute our brave army for exposing this conspiracy, and we also welcome the unity between the army and the people. The petition supports all the steps taken by the government and demands the execution of the conspirators so that the country can strongly deal with all the conspiracies of imperialism.

At the same time, Syrian and Egyptian public opinion strongly condemned the Washington authorities' statement on the situation in Syria.

The Syrian "Al-Ra'i al-'Aam" pointed out that Dulles' words about Soviet infiltration into Syria, Syria's armaments exceeding its defense needs, Syria threatening surrounding countries, and conspiring to subvert their regimes are nothing but lies and excuses for planning new conspiracies against Syria. The newspaper said that it is the United States that supplies arms to Israel, creates border incidents, and turns Turkey into an arms depot.

A commentator for Cairo Radio quoted Dulles as saying that Eisenhower had studied the situation in accordance with the United Nations Charter. He said: "We want to ask, what rights does the United Nations Charter give to the United States. Does the Charter give it the right to conspire to overthrow other countries? Does the Charter give it the right to create conspiracies in Jordan? Does the Charter give it the right to formulate the Eisenhower Doctrine? Does the Charter give it the right to threaten our country with the Sixth Fleet? Does the Charter give it the right to support the terrorism now imposed on the people of Jordan?"

The radio commentator commented on the United States' shipment of weapons to pro-Western Middle Eastern countries, saying, "The United States supplies these countries with weapons to serve its monopoly capital. It has done so in the past, but what was the result? It once gave Chiang Kai-shek a large number of weapons, but the Chinese people rose up and threw him on the island. It participated in the Korean War, but failed. In the Indochina War, it supplied France with weapons, but the weapons were useless, and France failed. Now it is supplying France with weapons so that it can continue its genocidal war in Algeria, but the Algerian people are inflicting heavy blows on the French. Also, just a few months ago, the French and British fleets shamefully left Port Said."

### 叙利亚决心应付一切可能事变  谴责美国声明是为侵略找借口

    叙利亚决心应付一切可能事变
    谴责美国声明是为侵略找借口
    本报综合报道　据新华社9日讯：叙利亚负责新闻和宣传事务的国务部长阿基勒8日对新闻记者说，美国所谓共产主义渗入叙利亚的说法，“是美国企图干涉叙利亚内政和准备侵略叙利亚的借口”。
  阿基勒在评论杜勒斯关于叙利亚局势的声明时说，叙利亚的人民、政府和军队“一致抱定决心来应付一切可能发生的事情。”
    同一天，叙利亚陆军参谋长比兹里向埃及“消息报”记者发表谈话说，美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊最近在华盛顿提出的报告中所谓叙利亚的局势很危险的说法，只是对帝国主义而言是这样。
    他驳斥帝国主义者关于叙利亚陆军和政府之间有冲突的宣传，他说，“这是没有根据的。我们这里是一个国家、一个政府和一支陆军。”
    阿拉伯复兴社会党领袖阿克拉姆·胡拉尼在“旗帜报”上号召“对美国的任何冒险行为提高警惕并加强应付的准备”。
    据叙利亚通讯社报道，来自叙利亚北部重要城市阿勒颇的一个代表团，在9月8日向叙利亚总统、议长、总理和内阁阁员们呈递了有一万七千多人签名的一份意见书，谴责美国最近的阴谋。
    意见书还说，我们向揭露这个阴谋的我们勇敢的陆军致意，我们也欢迎陆军和人民之间的团结。意见书支持政府所采取的一切步骤，并且要求处死阴谋分子，以使国家强有力地对付帝国主义的一切阴谋。
    与此同时，叙利亚和埃及舆论强烈谴责华盛顿当局关于叙利亚局势的声明。
    叙利亚“舆论报”指出，杜勒斯所说的苏联渗入叙利亚、叙利亚的军火超出了它的防御需要、叙利亚正在威胁周围的国家以及阴谋颠覆它们的政权，这些话都只不过是谎言和计划新的反对叙利亚的阴谋的借口。这家报纸说，把军火供给以色列、制造边境事件并且使土耳其变成军火储藏库的正是美国。
    开罗电台评论员引用了杜勒斯所说艾森豪威尔根据联合国宪章研究了局势一语。他说：“我们要问，联合国宪章赋予了美国什么权利。难道宪章赋予过它阴谋推翻其它国家的权利吗？难道宪章赋予过它在约旦制造阴谋的权利吗？难道宪章赋予过它制订艾森豪威尔主义的权利吗？难道宪章赋予过它用第六舰队来威胁我们的国家的权利吗？难道宪章赋予过它支持现在加在约旦人民身上的恐怖主义的权利吗？”
    电台评论员评论美国输送武器给亲西方的中东国家说，“美国供给这些国家武器是为它的垄断资本服务的，它过去也这样做过，但结果如何呢？它曾经大量地给过蒋介石武器，但是中国人民起来把他扔在岛上。它参加过朝鲜战争，但是失败了。在印度支那战争中，它供给过法国武器，但是武器没有用，法国失败了。现在它正在供给法国武器以便使它在阿尔及利亚继续进行斩尽杀绝的战争，但是阿尔及利亚人民正给予法国人以重大的打击。还有，就在几个月之前，法国和英国的舰队可耻地离开了塞得港。”（附图片）
