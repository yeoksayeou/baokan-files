Yantai Banana Apples Achieve a Bumper Harvest

    The famous Yantai green and red banana apples have once again enjoyed a widespread bumper harvest this year. It is estimated that this year's harvest will reach 10.8 million catties, more than double the production of last year, and more than 3 million catties more than the most productive year of 1955. For example, the more than 60,000 fruit trees of the Xingfu Fruit Tree Cooperative have branches weighed down by fruit. The cooperative expects to produce more than 3.7 million catties of green banana apples alone, and the good fruit rate has reached over 97% from 95% last year. The export qualification rate (first-class products) has also risen from 80% last year to 90%. Currently, fruit farmers are busy harvesting apples, and food export companies are also busy purchasing them. (Su Qiying)

    烟台香蕉苹果大丰收
    著名的烟台青、红香蕉苹果，今年又普庆丰收。据估计今年可收摘一千零八十万斤，比去年增产二倍多，比最丰产的1955年多产三百多万斤。如幸福果树社的六万多株果树，枝条都被果实压得垂地了，该社预计仅青香蕉苹果就可产三百七十多万斤，而且好果率由去年的95％达到了97％以上，出口合格率（一等品）也由去年的80％上升到90％。目前，果农们正在忙着收摘苹果，食品出口公司也在忙着收购。　（苏启颖）
