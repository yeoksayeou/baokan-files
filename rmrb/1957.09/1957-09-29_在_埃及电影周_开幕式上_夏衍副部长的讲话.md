Speech by Vice Minister Xia Yan at the Opening Ceremony of "Egyptian Film Week"

Respected Head of the Delegation, Ladies and Gentlemen:

The "Film Week of the Republic of Egypt," organized by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, opens today in our capital – Beijing.

Just half a month before this film week, the "Chinese Film Week" was also grandly held in Cairo, the capital of the Republic of Egypt. This is the first time that China and Egypt have mutually held film weeks. This also precisely embodies the spirit of cultural cooperation initiated by the 1955 Asian-African Conference by the governments of both countries.

Under the leadership of President Nasser, the heroic Egyptian people resisted the aggression of the colonialists and achieved a great victory. This victory not only defended Egypt's national independence and sovereignty, protected Egypt's culture with its long history, but also safeguarded world peace. People all over the world are excited and proud of the heroic actions of the Egyptian people. Recently, American imperialism has launched new aggressive conspiracies against the Middle East, and the Egyptian people have been respected by peace-loving people all over the world for maintaining the peace of Arab countries and supporting the heroic struggle of the Syrian people!

Holding the "Film Week of the Republic of Egypt" on such a day has new significance. It marks the support of the Chinese people for the just struggle of the Egyptian people, and it also marks the support for the just struggle of all Arab people.

Therefore, let us warmly congratulate the success of this film week!

Chinese filmmakers feel very honored by the visit of the Egyptian Film Delegation to this film week. Here, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to the Egyptian Film Delegation!

During this film week, the vast number of Chinese audiences will see many excellent films selected by the Egyptian government. These films include "Struggle in the Valley," which exposes the oppression of peasants by landlords before the revolution; "July Storm," which reflects the revolutionary events of July 1952 when the Egyptian people overthrew the Farouk dynasty; and "Life and Death," which depicts the moral values and sense of responsibility of good people. "Our Beautiful Days," a feature film depicting the friendship and love of young people, dubbed into Chinese, will also be screened during the film week. In addition, the Egyptian government has also selected a batch of newsreel documentaries produced by the State Guidance Department of Art Administration. These films will be screened successively in the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. During the film week, the film "Our Beautiful Days" will also be screened successively in fourteen cities including Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Nanning, Chongqing, Kunming, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Urumqi.

There is no doubt that the screening of these films will be warmly welcomed by the vast number of Chinese audiences. It shows the high achievements of the Egyptian film industry, and it is full of noble patriotism and humanitarian spirit. Through these films, we can see that the Egyptian people are working and creating diligently with great enthusiasm and full of confidence on the new page of Egyptian history to develop their economy and build their motherland.

These films show that a historically rich and powerful new Egypt is standing up on the African continent.

The mutual holding of film weeks between China and Egypt is a new milestone in cultural exchanges between the two countries, and it is also a new achievement in cultural relations, friendship, and unity between the two peoples.

Let me once again congratulate the success of the Egyptian Film Week!

Congratulations on the further development of Sino-Egyptian friendship and cultural exchanges!

Congratulations on President Nasser's health!

    在“埃及电影周”开幕式上
    夏衍副部长的讲话尊敬的代表团团长先生、女士们、先生们：
    中华人民共和国文化部举办的“埃及共和国电影周”，今天在我们的首都——北京开幕了。
    在这次电影周举办的半个月以前，在埃及共和国首都——开罗，也隆重地举办过“中国电影周”，中埃两国相互举办电影周都还是第一次。这也正是两国政府为了贯彻1955年亚非会议所创导的文化合作精神。
    英勇的埃及人民在纳赛尔总统的领导下，抗击了殖民主义者的侵略，取得了伟大的胜利。这一胜利，不仅保卫了埃及民族独立主权，保卫了埃及悠久历史的文化，也保卫了世界的和平。全世界的人民都为埃及人民的英雄行为而感到兴奋和骄傲。最近以来，美帝国主义对中东又展开了新的侵略阴谋，埃及人民为维护阿拉伯国家的和平，为支援叙利亚人民的英勇斗争而受到了全世界爱好和平的人民的尊敬！
    在这样的日子里，我们举办“埃及共和国电影周”，具有新的意义。它标志着中国人民对埃及人民的正义斗争的支持，也标志着对全阿拉伯人民的正义斗争的支持。
    为此，让我们热烈地祝贺这次电影周获得成功！
    埃及电影代表团的光临这次电影周，我们中国的电影工作者感到非常荣幸。这里，我谨代表中华人民共和国文化部向埃及电影代表团致以热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意！
    中国的广大观众，在这次电影周中将看到由埃及政府选送来的许多优秀影片，这些影片是“山谷里的斗争”，暴露革命前大地主对农民的欺压；“七月的风云”，反映1952年7月埃及人民推翻法鲁克王朝的革命事件；“生与死”，描写善良的人们的道德观念和责任感。由我国译制为华语对白的，描写青年们的友谊和爱情的故事片“我们美好的日子”也参加电影周映出。此外，埃及政府还选送来了一批由国家指导部艺术管理局摄制的新闻纪录影片。这些影片将先后在北京、天津、上海三个城市映出；电影周期间，沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、南京、杭州、济南、广州、武汉、南宁、重庆、昆明、西安、兰州、乌鲁木齐等十四个城市也将相继映出“我们美好的日子”这部影片。
    这些影片的映出，毫无疑问将受到中国广大观众的热烈欢迎，它显示了埃及电影事业的高度成就，它充满着崇高的爱国主义和人道主义的精神。通过这些影片，我们可以看到：埃及人民正以高度的热情和满怀信心，在埃及历史的新页上，为发展自己的经济，建设自己的祖国而辛勤地劳动与创造。
    这些影片显示了历史悠久的、富强的新埃及正在非洲大陆上站起来了。
    中埃两国相互举办电影周，是两国之间文化交流的一个新的里程碑，也是两国人民之间文化关系、友好团结的新成就。
    让我再一次祝贺埃及电影周的成功！
    祝贺中埃友谊和文化交流的进一步发展！
    祝贺纳赛尔总统的健康！
