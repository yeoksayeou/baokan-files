The Road to Bourgeois Literary Restoration is Impassable
Yao Xueyin's Wild Dreams Shattered
Wuhan Branch of the Writers Association Exposes This Rightist's Consistent Reactionary Nature

(Our dispatch) The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association held seven symposiums from August 5th to 29th, exposing and criticizing Yao Xueyin's consistent anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.

Yao Xueyin has long hated the socialist literary policy, slandering the implementation of Chairman Mao's literary policy as "staying in place, reciting last year's almanac." He attacked Chairman Mao's principle of political and artistic standards for literary criticism as "not only simple but also dead," merely a "general principle." He also slandered the Party's political and ideological leadership of literary work as "doctrinaire rule," saying that dogmatism "has leaders above and masses below, forming a huge and heavy social force." He also proposed bourgeois "unrestricted" "literary freedom" to replace the Party's literary policy. He also said that Marxism-Leninism was also "dogma" for writers' creation. He also opposed writers going deep into life, even saying that writers going to factories and rural areas was "drawing a circle as a prison" and "binding" the writers' hands and feet.

Yao Xueyin also used the name of opposing sectarianism to slander the Party for "disregarding and attacking old writers due to the trouble of sectarianism." He fabricated rumors out of thin air, saying: "Some works are not good, but they are praised as high as the sky. Most of these praised are party-member writers or writers who came out of the liberated areas," attempting to use this to instigate some writers to oppose the Party, undermine the unity between Party members and non-Party members, and create "two literary circles." He also described the entire literary world as dark and miserable, as "ministers cannot criticize their rulers, and sons cannot criticize their fathers," a "feudal era" with "tripwires everywhere, waiting for one of your ten thousand carefulnesses to be neglected."

During the nationwide great blooming and contending, Yao Xueyin also wrote a letter from Beijing to Wuhan, asking the rightist Li Rui to open a special column in "Changjiang Literature" to publish articles attacking the Party.

At the same time, he also frequently associated with rightists in Beijing, Henan and other places such as Peng Zigang, Yao Fangzao, Mei Duo, and Su Jinshan, exchanging anti-Party "inside news" and spreading rumors everywhere.

Yao Xueyin has always pretended to be a "progressive writer," but peeling off his disguise reveals a thoroughly bourgeois and ugly soul. He sneaked into the Communist Party in 1927, but soon deserted. He rejoined the Party in 1937, but refused the work assigned to him by the Party, and insisted on "the War of Resistance must uniformly obey the Kuomintang." Later, he wrote low-level erotic works such as "Romance in the Military" and "When Spring Blossoms," to help the Kuomintang corrupt and paralyze young people. He also colluded with the cultural secret service chief Zhang Daofan, and co-founded the magazine "Micro Wave" with the cultural secret service agent Chen Jiying. At the same time, he maintained an "extremely warm friendship" with the cultural secret service agent Sun Ling. On the eve of Shanghai's liberation, he and the renegade Zhang Songhe, Shi Xiaoping and some secret agents formed a pseudo-underground organization called "Jiangnan Working Committee of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." He served as "Minister of Propaganda" and carried out shocking political speculation activities, which were finally banned by the Party. Even eight years after liberation, in his article "Ode to Lugou Bridge," he still frantically sang nauseating praises to Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the people.

    资产阶级文艺复辟的道路不通
    姚雪垠的狂想破灭
    作协武汉分会揭穿了这个右派分子的一贯反动本质
    本报讯  中国作家协会武汉分会从8月5日至29日召开了七次座谈会，揭发和批判了姚雪垠一贯反共反社会主义的言行。
    姚雪垠长期以来仇视社会主义文艺方针，诬蔑执行毛主席的文艺方针是“原地踏步走，背诵去年的皇历”。攻击毛主席提的文艺批评的政治标准和艺术标准的原则“不仅是简单的，而且是死的”，一个“总原则”而已。他还把党对文艺事业的政治思想领导诬蔑为“教条主义的统治”，说什么教条主义“上有领导，下有群众，形成了一种巨大的、沉重的社会力量”。他还提出资产阶级“百无禁忌”的“文学自由”来代替党的文艺方针。他还说马列主义对作家的创作也是“教条”，他还反对作家深入生活，甚至说作家到工厂、农村生活是“划地为牢”，是“捆缚”了作家的手脚。
    姚雪垠还借反对宗派主义之名，诬蔑党由于“宗派主义作祟，发生了轻视和打击老作家的现象”。他无中生有地造谣说：“有些作品不好的，却被捧到天上一样高，这些被推崇的大都是党员作家或解放区出来的作家”，企图借此煽动一部分作家反对党，破坏党与非党的团结，制造“两个文坛”。他还把整个文艺界说成是阴暗凄惨的，是“臣不能议其君，子不能议其父”的“封建时代”，“到处布置了绊马索，等着你一万个小心中的一个疏忽”。
    在全国大鸣大放期间，姚雪垠还从北京写信到武汉，要右派分子李蕤在“长江文艺”辟一专栏，专门发表攻击党的文章。
    与此同时，他还跟北京、河南等地的右派分子彭子冈、姚芳藻、梅朵、苏金伞等过往频繁，交流反党的“内幕新闻”，并到处传播谣言。
    姚雪垠一贯以“进步作家”自居，剥开其外衣来看，却是一个彻头彻尾的资产阶级的丑恶的灵魂。他1927年混入共产党，不久便开了小差。他1937年重新混入党内，但却拒绝党分配给他的工作，并坚决主张“抗日必须统一服从国民党”、以后，他又写出“戎马恋”、“春暖花开的时候”等低级色情的作品，来帮助国民党腐蚀和麻醉青年。他还与文化特务头子张道藩勾勾搭搭，并与文化特务陈纪莹合办刊物“微波”，同时跟文化特务孙陵保存着“极其温暖的友情”。上海解放前夕，他又和叛党分子张松和、石小萍以及一些特务组成伪地下组织“中共中央华东局江南工作委员会”，他自任“宣传部长”，进行了骇人听闻的政治投机活动，最后被党取缔。直到解放后八年的今天，他还在“芦沟桥礼赞”一文中，还丧心病狂地对全国人民的公敌蒋介石作了肉麻的歌颂。
