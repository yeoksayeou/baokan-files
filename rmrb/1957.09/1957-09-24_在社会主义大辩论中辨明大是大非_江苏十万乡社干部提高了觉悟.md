Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd: Jiangsu Province has already had sixty counties and twelve suburban districts of cities hold three-level cadre meetings or Party representative conferences. 100,000 township and commune cadres, through the socialist debate centered on the grain issue at the meetings, have been tempered and educated, raised their socialist ideological awareness, and created favorable conditions for organizing 40 million farmers across the province to launch a socialist debate and complete the annual grain purchase task.
At the cadre meetings held in various parts of Jiangsu, after analysis, it was affirmed that the basic situation in the countryside is good. Cadres in Lishui County said that in the past it was "three sees and three doesn't sees," that is, only seeing shortcomings and not seeing achievements; only seeing the backward aspects of farmers and not seeing that farmers are easy to educate; only seeing problems in the countryside and not seeing the reasons for them. Through the education of the meetings, they believe that the basic situation in the countryside is "three mores and three lesses," that is, more achievements and fewer shortcomings; more people supporting the cooperative path and fewer people unwilling to take the cooperative path; more people with improved lives and fewer people without improvements. Through concrete analysis, cadres in various places have recognized that the current contradiction in the countryside is a contradiction between two paths in politics and ideology. Everyone exposed the sabotage activities of the already overthrown hostile class elements in the countryside, analyzed the somewhat resistant emotions of a few wealthy middle peasants towards socialist transformation, and also reviewed their own errors in relaxing the political and ideological struggle and concealing grain and dividing it privately. The meetings in various places used the method of presenting facts and reasoning to initially clarify the major issues of right and wrong on the grain issue. On the basis of improved understanding, various places generally focused on discussing the grain work policy of using good harvests to make up for poor harvests and purchasing more and selling less in good years, debated the questions of whether the grain ration standard in the countryside is low and whether concealing grain and dividing it privately is good, and deeply criticized individualism and departmentalism.
On the issue of grain ration standards, cadres in various places, through the method of recalling comparisons and class analysis, have recognized that the grain consumption level of the vast majority of farmers in the countryside, except for a few landlords, rich peasants, and wealthy middle peasants, has greatly improved; believing that except for a few single men and those who eat and drink extravagantly, and those who engage in black market transactions, the vast majority of farmers have enough to eat, and some places even have around 30% of households with surplus grain. The issue of concealing grain and dividing it privately was the focus of debate at cadre meetings in many areas, and was the most intense ideological struggle for cadres. The cadres attending the meeting recalled the lessons of purchasing less and selling more and concealing grain and dividing it privately in the previous period, and recognized that concealing grain and dividing it privately is a reflection of individualism and capitalist ideology, which is not only detrimental to the country, but also harms the local people.
Through this meeting, Party committees at all levels have initially learned how to conduct debates. In Liyang, Liuhe, Jiangyin, Binhai, Sheyang and other counties, where the debate was carried out relatively well, not only were the ideological problems of cadres solved more thoroughly, but also the concerns of some cadres about being afraid that farmers would not be able to open up and debate well were initially dispelled, and the idea of trusting the majority of the masses was established. Siyang and other counties also summarized the experience of the pilot projects in the previous stage and criticized the simple and crude practices adopted in the debate. In order to prevent simple and crude practices, many counties have also formulated work disciplines.
At present, the socialist education movement in most counties in Jiangsu Province has gradually deepened into the townships and communes. In Suzhou, Zhenjiang and other areas where progress is faster, most of the commune and team cadres have been trained and are now generally holding meetings of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    在社会主义大辩论中辨明大是大非
    江苏十万乡社干部提高了觉悟
    新华社南京23日电　江苏省已经有六十个县和十二个市郊区召开三级干部会议或党代表大会，有十万个乡社干部在会上经过以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论，受到了锻炼和教育，提高了社会主义思想觉悟，为组织全省四千万农民展开社会主义大辩论，完成全年粮食征购任务，创造了有利条件。
    江苏各地召开的干部会议，经过分析，肯定农村的基本形势是好的。溧水县的干部说，过去是“三看三不看”，即只看缺点，不看成绩；只看农民落后方面，不看农民易于接受教育方面；只看农村中的问题，不看其原因何在。通过会议的教育，他们认为农村的基本形势是“三多三少”，即成绩多，缺点少；拥护走合作化道路的人多，不愿走合作化道路的人少；生活改善的人多，没有改善的人少。各地干部通过具体分析，认清了当前农村中的矛盾是政治上和思想上两条道路的矛盾。大家揭发了农村中已被打倒的敌对阶级分子的破坏活动，分析了少数富裕中农对社会主义改造的某些抵触情绪，同时也检讨了自己放松政治上思想上的斗争和瞒产私分等的错误行为。各地会议用摆事实、讲道理的方法，初步辨明了粮食问题上的大是大非。在认识提高的基础上，各地一般都着重讨论了以丰补歉、丰年多购少销的粮食工作方针，辩论了农村的留粮标准低不低、瞒产私分好不好这两个问题，深入地批判了个人主义和本位主义思想。
    在口粮标准问题上，各地干部通过回忆对比和阶级分析的方法，都认清了目前农村中除少数地主、富农和富裕中农以外，广大农民的吃粮水平已有很大提高；认为除了少数单身汉和大吃大喝的人、进行黑市买卖的人口粮稍紧外，绝大多数农民都是够吃的，有的地方还有30％左右的农户有余粮。瞒产私分问题，是许多地区干部会议争论的焦点，是干部的思想斗争最激烈的问题。到会干部回忆了前一时期少购多销、瞒产私分的教训，认识到瞒产私分是个人主义和资本主义思想的反映，既对国家不利，也害了当地人民。
    各级党委通过这次会议，都初步学会了开展辩论的方法。辩论开展得比较好的溧阳、六合、江阴、滨海、射阳等县，不但干部的思想问题解决比较深透，还初步解除了部分干部怕农民放不开、辩不好的顾虑，树立了相信群众多数的思想。泗阳等县还总结了前一阶段试点的经验，批判了在辩论中采取简单粗暴的做法。不少县为了防止简单粗糙的做法，还订出了工作纪律。
    目前，江苏省大部分县的社会主义教育运动已逐步深入到乡社。进度较快的苏州、镇江等专区，社、队干部大部分已经训练完毕，正在普遍召开贫农和下中农会议。
