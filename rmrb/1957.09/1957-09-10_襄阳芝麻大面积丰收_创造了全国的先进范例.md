(Report from our Wuhan Office, 30th) Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, has achieved a bumper sesame harvest on 380,000 mu of land (currently being harvested). The estimated average yield per mu is 120 jin, an increase of 33.3% compared to last year's average yield per mu, and 1.5 times higher than the national average sesame yield per unit area last year. Large-scale high-yields have appeared in the "Five Star" Cooperative, the "Prairie Fire" Cooperative, the "Common Prosperity" Cooperative, and the "August 1st" Cooperative, with average yields ranging from 200 to 400 jin per mu.

In early August, the National Sesame and Peanut Delegation (including agricultural labor models, agricultural college professors, and agricultural technicians) visited the sesame fields here. They unanimously agreed that Xiangyang County's comprehensive sesame bumper harvest not only provides a large amount of oil for the country and increases income for the agricultural cooperatives, but also creates an advanced example for sesame production nationwide. The delegation summarized the experiences of sesame bumper harvests here and prepared to promote them throughout the country.
