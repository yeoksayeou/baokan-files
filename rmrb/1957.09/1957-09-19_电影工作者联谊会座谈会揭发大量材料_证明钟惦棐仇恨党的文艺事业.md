　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The China Film Workers Association has recently continued to hold several symposiums, further exposing and criticizing the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of the anti-Party element Zhong Dianfei.

　　Many facts and materials revealed at the symposium show that this Zhong Dianfei, who touted himself as an "authority," was actually impersonating an expert and pretending to be knowledgeable. Many directors, actors, and others pointed out in their speeches that in addition to the fundamental errors in his articles, there were even many common-sense errors. For example, Zhong criticized in his article "The Gongs and Drums of Film" the idea that "should the paper tape recorder be changed to a magnetic tape recorder" also had to be submitted to the Film Bureau for approval, but in fact, the two were originally the same thing. When Zhong Dianfei previously worked in the Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he was never very interested in the work assigned by the Party and never completed it well, adopting a serious liberal attitude. The official documents he handled were very rough, and even the writing was incomprehensible. However, he was very enthusiastic about his own writing, pursuing personal fame and fortune. When he was in the Central Propaganda Department, he claimed that he "lacked a common language" with many leading comrades in the literary and art departments, opposed the leadership, and did not associate with comrades, living "in isolation." However, he was intimately involved with some "confidants" such as the right-wingers He Chi and Guo Wei, and some young people who were deceived and misled by him, and his door was crowded with visitors, leaking Party secrets and scolding leaders. In the name of "helping" young people, he controlled some people under his command, attempting to create his own influence. For example, after he "helped" the young author Zhang Xian publish a film script, whenever the magazine editorial department wanted to talk to Zhang Xian, it had to go through Zhong Dianfei, even to the point of preventing Zhang Xian from participating in film script writing workshops and personally collecting and forwarding manuscript fees on his behalf. Zhong went everywhere to get money, and his methods were no less despicable than those of Lü Ban. He wrote to Zhang Xian asking if he could "send" him some money to buy books, and he accepted one hundred yuan without shame. Zhong Dianfei made some suggestions to the script of "people who do not stick to the trivial," and even wrote directly to the head of the Changchun Film Studio editorial department, asking: "Can you give me some editing remuneration?"; but it had to be done in an "absolutely secret manner."

　　The materials revealed at the meeting proved that Zhong Dianfei stubbornly opposed the Party's literary and art policy. He hated talking about art serving politics, saying, "No matter what kind of capitalist or socialist, a good film is one that moves people." He also denied the importance of ideological remolding of artists and the Marxist worldview, advocating that artists have "greater freedom." Zhong Dianfei also deeply hated and loathed the Party's leadership over literature and art: he believed that "only artists can lead art."

　　Zhong Dianfei was not only anti-Party in literary and artistic thought and hated the Party's literary and art undertakings, but also launched malicious attacks on the entire Party. The revelation at the most recent symposium was that in late May, he made extremely vicious and absurd anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks to a reporter from China Youth magazine. He praised the right-wingers at Peking University for attacking the Party, considering it "the revival of the May Fourth Spirit." He also falsely accused "good cadres" and "strong Party spirit" as being "drinking tea, smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, and being obsequious. Having even a little independent opinion means being labeled either right-leaning or left-leaning." In several symposiums, many film artists spoke enthusiastically to refute some of Zhong Dianfei's fallacies. The veteran filmmaker Luo Jing contrasted the film industry before and after liberation. He pointed out that since liberation, the number of film screening units in our country has increased more than tenfold compared with before liberation, and the audience has also increased more than tenfold compared with the early days of liberation, and we have established our own film machinery industry, powerfully refuting Zhong Dianfei's nonsense that things are not as good as before. He Wenjin and Wang Jiayi, who had just returned from visiting France, cited the various difficulties faced by the vast number of French film workers, the threat of unemployment, and the fact that film artists with a sense of justice could not freely choose the creations they wanted to carry out to refute Zhong Dianfei's attempt to "regress" film back to the capitalist road. Directors Cheng Yin and Gan Xuewei, and Zhong Jingzhi and Xu Zhiqiao from the Film Academy, all talked about how the Soviet Union first created unforgettable images of new worker-class heroes in film art, opening up a new era in film art that was more popular and more deeply rooted in the working people, and cited many facts to illustrate that the development of the new China's film industry is inseparable from the Soviet Union's selfless assistance, refuting Zhong Dianfei's fallacy of opposing learning from the Soviet Union. At the most recent conference, after Zhong Dianfei made his third self-criticism, Chairman Chen Huangmei read aloud to everyone Zhong Dianfei's anti-Party remarks to the "China Youth" reporter, pointing out that Zhong Dianfei's self-criticism still had not changed his position. He pointed out that Zhong Dianfei was not only anti-Party and anti-socialist in literary and artistic thought, but had developed to the point of making vicious attacks and slanders against the Party Central Committee's leadership and major policies. He was instructed to honestly and thoroughly explain himself to the Party.

### 电影工作者联谊会座谈会揭发大量材料  证明钟惦棐仇恨党的文艺事业

　　电影工作者联谊会座谈会揭发大量材料
　　证明钟惦棐仇恨党的文艺事业
    据新华社18日讯　中国电影工作者联谊会最近继续举行多次座谈会，进一步揭露和批判反党分子钟惦棐的反党反社会主义的言行。
    座谈会上揭露的许多事实和材料说明，这个自诩为“权威”的钟惦棐，实际上是冒充内行、假充博学。许多导演、演员等人的发言都指出：他的一些文章中除了基本的观点有错误外，甚至有许多常识性的错误。如钟在“电影的锣鼓”一文中大加批评的“纸带录音机可否要改作磁性录音机”也要呈请电影局批准，其实这两者原来就是一个东西。钟惦棐从前在文化部艺术局、中共中央宣传部工作时，对党所分配的工作总是兴趣不大，从来不去很好地完成，采取了严重的自由主义的态度，他所办理的公文，非常粗糙，甚至文字不通。但非常热心自己的写作，追求个人的名利。他在中宣部时，自称与许多文艺处的领导同志“缺乏共同语言”，反对领导，和同志不来往，“离群索居”，但是和一些“知己”何迟、郭维等右派分子和一些被他欺骗蒙蔽的青年往返亲密，门庭如市，泄露党的机密，谩骂领导。他以“帮助”青年为名，将一些人控制在他的手下，企图造成自己的势力，例如他“帮助”青年作者张弦发表电影剧本后，凡是杂志编辑部要同张弦谈话，就必须通过钟惦棐，甚至到阻止张弦参加电影剧作讲习会、亲自代张收转稿费。钟到处搞钱，其手法之恶劣不下于吕班，他写信问张弦可否“送”他一点钱买书，居然受之无愧地接受了一百元。钟惦棐对“不拘小节的人”的剧本提出过一些意见，竟直接向长影编辑处长写信提出：“可否给我一点编辑酬劳”；但是要用“绝对的秘密的方式”。
    大会上揭发的材料，证明了钟惦棐顽强地反对党的文艺方针。他厌恶谈艺术为政治服务，说，“不管什么资本主义的、社会主义的，感动人的就是好影片。”他也否认艺术家思想改造和马克思主义世界观的重要性，主张艺术家有“更大的自由”，钟惦棐并且十分厌恶、仇恨党对文艺的领导：他认为“领导艺术的只能是艺术家”。
    钟惦棐不仅是在文艺思想上反党、仇恨党的文艺事业，并且对整个党进行恶意的攻击。最近一次座谈会上的揭露，5月下旬，他向中国青年杂志的一个记者发表了极其恶毒荒谬的反党反社会主义的言论。他对北大右派向党进攻颇为称赞，认为是“五四精神的复活”。他还诬蔑“好干部”和“党性强”就是“喝喝茶、抽抽烟、看看报、唯唯诺诺。稍有一点独立见解不是扣右倾就是扣左倾。”在多次座谈会中，许多电影艺术工作者热烈发言驳斥钟惦棐的一些谬论。老电影工作者罗静予以解放前后的电影事业作了鲜明的对比。他指出解放以来我国电影放映单位比解放前增加十多倍，观众比解放初期也增加十多倍，建立了自己的电影机械工业，有力地驳斥了钟惦棐今不如昔的谰言。刚访问过法国回来的何文今、王家乙在发言中举了法国广大电影工作者遭受到各种困难，受到失业的威胁，有正义感的电影艺术工作者不能自由选择自己所愿意进行的创作等事实来驳斥钟惦棐企图把电影“倒退”回资本主义道路的想法。导演成荫、干学伟，电影学院钟敬之、许之乔等人发言都谈到苏联首先在电影艺术中创造了难忘的工人阶级新英雄的形象，开辟了电影艺术更普及、更深入劳动人民的新纪元，并且列举许多事实说明新中国电影事业的发展是和苏联大公无私的帮助分不开的，驳斥了钟惦棐反对学习苏联的谬论。在最近一次大会上，钟惦棐作第三次检讨后，主席陈荒煤向大家宣读了钟惦棐对“中国青年”记者发表的反党言论。指出钟惦棐的检讨仍然没有改变立场。指出钟惦棐不仅是在文艺思想上反党反社会主义，而是发展到对党中央领导和重大政策有恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。责成钟惦棐应该向党老老实实，彻底交代。
