    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 26th. The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" published on the 25th Premier Kádár's conversation with the newspaper's reporter concerning his visit to China before leaving Budapest.
    Kádár said that we were very happy to accept the invitation from the Chinese comrades. This trip abroad by the Hungarian government delegation is the second since the counter-revolutionary events last year. It is no coincidence that this trip happens to be to Beijing. In the past few months, apart from the Soviet Union, we have received the most moral, political, and material support from China.
    Kádár said that the Hungarian government delegation is going to Beijing to participate in the Chinese people's celebration of National Day. Naturally, we also want to take this opportunity to learn from the ideological and practical achievements of the Chinese comrades in socialist construction. Up to now, we have been striving to learn as much as possible from the experience of the Chinese comrades, whether in the struggle against counter-revolution and right-leaning revisionism, or in establishing a new style of work. During this visit, we will also convey the gratitude and love of our people to the great Chinese brotherly people. We believe that we will return with rich experiences and good lessons. These experiences will have a positive effect on solving our major tasks.

    卡达尔总理谈访问中国之行
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”25日发表了卡达尔总理在离开布达佩斯以前就访问中国问题对这家报纸记者的谈话。
    卡达尔说，我们非常高兴地接受了中国同志的邀请。这次出国是匈牙利政府代表从去年反革命事件以来的第二次出国。这次出国恰好是去北京，这是并非偶然的。除苏联之外，我们在过去几个月中，从中国得到了道义上、政治上和物质上的最多的支持。
    卡达尔说，这次匈牙利政府代表团去北京，是要参加中国人民庆祝国庆的典礼。自然，我们还想利用这个机会，从中国同志们在社会主义建设中所获得的思想上的和实际工作中的成就吸取经验。到现在为止，无论是在对反革命和对右倾修正主义的斗争方面，或是在树立新的工作作风方面，我们都正在努力尽量吸取中国同志的经验。我们在这次访问中，还要转达我国人民对伟大的中国的兄弟人民的谢意和敬爱。我们相信，我们将带着丰富的体验和良好的经验回来。这些经验对解决我们的重大任务将产生良好的作用。
