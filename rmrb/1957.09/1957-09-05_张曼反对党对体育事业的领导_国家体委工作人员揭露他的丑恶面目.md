Zhang Man Opposes the Party's Leadership over Sports
Staff of the National Sports Commission Expose His Ugly Face

(Reported by this newspaper) The National Sports Commission convened an all-staff meeting from August 27th to 30th to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of the rightist Zhang Man within the Party.

Zhang Man was the section chief of the School Cadre Section of the National Sports Commission. He came from a landlord family and joined the Party in 1944. After joining the Party, he was consistently restless in his work and schemed for personal fame and gain. When his personal ambitions could not be realized, he became dissatisfied with the Party, slandered the Party's policies, attacked the Party's leadership, and finally degenerated into an anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist.

According to the exposures at the meeting, Zhang Man consistently slandered and attacked the Party's policies. Zhang Man slandered the Party's policy of reforming intellectuals, saying, "A left struggle one time, a right struggle another time, they interfere too much!" When some rightists viciously attacked the personnel departments and the school Party committees, Zhang Man also echoed the same tune, saying, "The personnel departments can consider absorbing non-Party members to participate," and "The school Party committee system can be considered for change."

Zhang Man opposed the Party's leadership over sports. He believed that the Party could not lead sports. Zhang Man dismissed the work achievements of the Sports Commission entirely. He said, "The Sports Commission's policy is wrong; it only focuses on the top and doesn't promote mass sports." He also clamored like other rightists: Outsiders cannot lead insiders. He said, "The Sports Commission should not lead the Sports Institute."

Zhang Man has been working at the Sports Commission for more than four years and certainly knows the significance of establishing the Sports Commission, but he fabricated rumors with ulterior motives, saying, "The establishment of the Sports Commission allows these few leading cadres to play ball."

During the blooming and contending, Zhang Man felt that the time had come to attack the Party and satisfy his personal base desires. He wrote an opinion letter of six or seven thousand words, viciously attacking the leaders of the Sports Commission.

The reactionary and ugly face of the rightist Zhang Man within the Party has been thoroughly exposed, and his fallacies have been severely criticized by everyone.

    张曼反对党对体育事业的领导
    国家体委工作人员揭露他的丑恶面目
    本报讯　国家体育运动委员会于8月27日至30日连续召开了全体工作人员大会，揭发和批判了党内右派分子张曼的反党反社会主义言行。
    张曼是国家体育运动委员会的学校干部科科长，地主家庭出身，1944年入党。入党后一贯不安心工作，为个人名利打算。当个人野心得不到实现时，他则对党不满，污蔑党的政策，攻击党的领导，最后终于堕落成为一个反党反社会主义的右派分子。
    据会上揭露：张曼一贯诬蔑和攻击党的政策。张曼诬蔑党对知识分子的改造政策说：“左一次斗争，右一次斗争，过问得太多了！”当一些右派分子对人事部门和学校党委制进行恶毒攻击的时候，张曼也唱出了同样的论调说：“人事部门可以考虑吸收党外人士参加”，“学校党委制可以考虑改变”。
    张曼反对党对体育事业的领导。他认为，党不能领导体育。对体委的工作成绩，张曼是一笔抹煞。他说：“体委的方针错了，只在上面，没搞群众性的体育运动”。他还同其他右派分子一样地叫嚣：外行不能领导内行。说：“体委不应该领导体育学院”。
    张曼在体委工作已四年多了，当然知道成立体委的意义，但他却别有用心地造谣说：“成立体委，可以让这几个领导干部来打打球。”
    在大鸣大放中，张曼认为向党进攻和满足个人卑鄙欲望的时机来到了。他写了一份六、七千字的意见书，向体委领导恶毒地进攻。
    党内右派分子张曼的反动丑恶面目已被彻底揭露了，他的谬论受到大家严厉的批判。
