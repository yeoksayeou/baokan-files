Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Nedyalko Nedyalkov, held a banquet tonight to welcome Chairman Yugov and the delegation he led on their visit to China.

Vice-Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet.

Chairman Yugov spoke first at the banquet. He said, "Our government delegation has been in the capital of the People's Republic of China for three days. We are now on our third day as witnesses to the natural outpouring of the warmest feelings of the Chinese working people towards our people and the People's Republic of Bulgaria. We have seen this outpouring of emotion during the welcome, during our tour of the city, in the Forbidden City, in the electron tube factory, and at today's mass rally welcoming us, which displayed the friendship between Bulgaria and China."

Yugov said that all meetings and talks between our government delegation and the leaders of the People's Republic of China were conducted in an extremely sincere atmosphere, with complete mutual understanding and ideological unity.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke. He said, "The visit to our country by the Bulgarian government delegation headed by Comrade Yugov has added a new page to the history of friendly relations between China and Bulgaria. This visit will not only further deepen mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between our two countries, but will also greatly contribute to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the noble cause of world peace." Premier Zhou added that tomorrow you will visit other parts of our country. As in Beijing, you will be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people everywhere. At the same time, I sincerely hope that you will offer criticisms and corrections regarding our work in various aspects.

    于哥夫主席在宴会上首先讲话。他说，我们政府代表团在中华人民共和国的首都已经三天了。我们作为中国劳动人民对我国人民，对保加利亚人民共和国最热烈感情的自然流露的见证人也已经是第三天了。无论在欢迎的时候，在我们游览市容的时候，在故宫，在电子管厂和在今天显示保中友谊的群众大会上欢迎我们的时候都能见到这种感情的流露。
    于哥夫说，在我们政府代表团和中华人民共和国的领导人之间的一切会见和交谈都是在极其诚挚的气氛中，在相互完全谅解，和思想一致的情况下进行的。他祝中国人民在社会主义建设和中华人民共和国的全面繁荣中获得新的胜利。
    周恩来总理接着讲话。他说，以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚政府代表团来我国访问，给中保两国友好关系的历史增加了新的一页。这次访问不仅将进一步加深我们两国之间的相互了解和友好合作，同时也一定大大有利于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和维护世界和平的崇高事业。周总理又说，明天你们就要到我国其他各地进行参观访问。同在北京一样，你们将会到处受到中国人民的热烈欢迎。同时，我衷心地希望你们对于我们各方面的工作提出批评和指正。
    周恩来总理在讲话中还说，中国人民对于保加利亚人民在各方面所给予的兄弟援助十分感谢，并且愿意同保加利亚人民一起继续为加强我们两国间的友好合作关系而努力。
