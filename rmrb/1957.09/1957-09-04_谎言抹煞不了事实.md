Lies Cannot Erase Facts

    Rightist elements say: The lives of farmers now are still as impoverished as before liberation. The reporter recently visited the Xinlian Agricultural Cooperative in Taigu County, Shanxi Province. The farmers of this cooperative, like farmers in thousands upon thousands of villages, lived impoverished lives before liberation. In 1948, each person could only get an average of just over 100 catties of grain per year, supplementing it with bran and vegetables, and often going hungry when grain prices soared during the lean season. Needless to say, clothing was even worse, with one cotton-padded jacket lasting for ten years.

    After liberation, especially after the establishment of the cooperative in 1952, things changed dramatically here: grain production increased much more than before liberation. Last year, the cooperative's more than 12,400 mu of land averaged 361 catties per mu. After paying public grain and selling surplus grain, each person (adults and children) retained an average of 441 catties of grain, and the standard of living improved significantly. Things like bicycles, thermos bottles, and rubber shoes, which were rarely seen in the village before liberation, are not rare at all now.

    谎言抹煞不了事实
    右派分子说：现在农民的生活还是和解放前一样贫困。记者最近访问了山西省太谷县的新联农业社。这个社的农民和千千万万村庄的农民一样，在解放前过着穷困的生活。1948年，每人每年平均只能得到一百多斤粮食，其余用糠菜来填补，逢到青黄不接粮价大涨时，就常常饿肚子。穿衣更不必说了，一件棉袄要穿上十年。
    解放后，特别是1952年建立合作社后，这里大大变了样：粮食产量比解放前增长很多，去年全社一万二千四百多亩地，平均亩产三百六十一斤，除缴纳公粮和出售余粮外，每人（大小人口）平均留粮四百四十一斤，生活水平显著提高了。解放前，村里很少看到的自行车、暖水瓶和胶鞋等等用品，现在一点也不希罕了。
