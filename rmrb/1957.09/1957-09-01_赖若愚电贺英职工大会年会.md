Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to Thomas Williamson, Chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, and Vincent Tewson, General Secretary, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and all Chinese workers, to express congratulations on the 89th Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress.

The telegram said that the British trade union movement has achieved many successes in the struggle to win democratic rights, improve living conditions, and improve working conditions for British workers. We believe that it will achieve even greater successes in the future.

Chinese and British workers and trade unions have established friendly ties and have a common desire to continuously strengthen this relationship. We believe that the friendship and mutual understanding between Chinese and British workers will grow day by day.

Chinese and British workers have common interests.
