　　Beijing Sailing Club
　　Early in the morning, before the dawn breaks through the horizon, the Houhai Lake in Beijing is quiet, without a sound, and the lake surface is as smooth as a mirror.
　　Suddenly, teams of young men and women with tanned skin and strong physiques, wearing only vests and shorts, appear on the shore of the lake. They quickly form teams of eight and board the naval six-oared sampans docked by the lake amidst the loud slogan of "Exercise for the motherland, exercise, exercise!" With the short and forceful command of the commander, the six sampan oars are neatly plunged into the water, and with a slight lift and fall of the oarsmen, the sampans speed across the water like arrows.... Gradually, the sun rises, and groups of Young Pioneers wearing red scarves come to the lake. They quickly take off their coats, form a circle for warm-up exercises, and then board the juvenile sampans and single sculls. At this time, the lake becomes lively, with various sampans and small boats shuttling back and forth. The Beijing Sailing Club's day of activities begins again.
　　The Beijing Sailing Club offers sailing sports such as sampan, marine communication, ship models, sailing, knotting, climbing, and motorboats. During the busy summer vacation, the club receives about a thousand trainees a day.
　　The Beijing Sailing Club was established and developed as follows: In 1952, a naval exhibition was held in Beihai Park. At the end of the exhibition, six naval sampans were left behind. At that time, the Central National Defense Sports Club used these sampans to carry out sailing activities in Houhai, attracting a large number of young students to participate in this activity. The sampans were not enough, so the Central National Defense Sports Club sent people to Dalian to purchase a batch of sampans and military sailing boats; since then, in addition to sampans, ship models, marine communication, sailing and other projects have been launched. Under the demands and promotion of the masses, the development of sailing sports has become more and more widespread, and more and more people have participated. In 1956, the Beijing Water Sports Station was established, and soon it was changed to the Beijing Sailing Club.
　　Last August, the 1956 National Sailing Competition was held in Qingdao. Before participating in the competition, the young athletes began active practice. Every day, under the scorching sun, the oarsmen rowed sampan oars weighing twenty kilograms for training. Blisters appeared on their hands one after another, and their buttocks were worn with blood. However, no one complained. In their minds, there was only one common idea: they must not fall behind in the competition and must strive for honor for the capital. As a result of the competition, no one expected that the Beijing Water Sports Team, which had no sea and short training time, won the first place in the overall score, and won the championships in sculling sampan, tug-of-war and multiple sports.
　　In July this year, the national team came to Beijing. The young athletes lost when they competed with the older brothers in the men's and women's sampan races, but their tenacity was warmly praised by the older brothers. Since then, the Beijing Sailing Club's reputation has spread among sailing clubs in Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other places, and everyone believes that the Beijing Water Sports Team is a tenacious and powerful opponent.

　　北京航海俱乐部
    清晨，晨曦还没有透过地平线，北京后海湖边静悄悄地没有一点声音，湖水平静如镜。
    忽然，湖边上出现了一队队皮肤黝黑、体格健壮、只穿着背心、短裤的青年男女。他们很快地站成了八人一队，在响亮的“为祖国，锻炼，锻炼！”的口号声中登上了停在湖边的海军用的六桨舢舨。在指挥员短促有力的号令声中，六只舢舨桨整齐地划入了水中，桨手们略一俯仰之间，舢舨像箭一般地在水面上飞驰起来……。渐渐地太阳升起了，一群群系着红领巾的少先队员来到了湖边，他们迅速地脱了外衣，排成一圈作过了准备活动，便登上了少年舢舨和单人艇。这时，湖面上便开始热闹起来了，各种舢舨、小艇穿梭般地在湖上滑驶着。北京市航海俱乐部一天的活动又开始了。
    北京市航海俱乐部举办的航海运动项目有舢舨、航海通讯、船舰模型、驶帆、结绳、攀登、摩托艇。在活动频繁的暑假中，俱乐部在一天中要接待一千名左右的学员。
    北京市航海俱乐部是这样建立和发展起来的：1952年在北海公园内曾举行了一个海军展览会，展览会结束时，留下了六条海军舢舨。当时中央国防体育俱乐部便利用这些舢舨在后海开展航海运动，吸引了大批青年学生参加这项活动。舢舨不够了，中央国防体育俱乐部便派人去大连购置了一批舢舨、军事帆船；从此，他们除了舢舨以外，船舰模型、海上通讯、驶帆等项目都开展了。在群众的要求和推动下，航海运动的开展越来越广泛，参加的人更多了，到1956年便成立了北京市水上运动站，不久便改为北京市航海俱乐部。
    去年8月，在青岛举行了1956年全国航海运动比赛大会。在参加比赛前，年轻的选手们开始了积极的练习。桨手们每天在炽热的阳光下，划着重二十公斤的舢舨桨，进行锻炼。他们手上的血泡一个接一个，臀部都磨出了血。但是，谁也没有叫过一声苦。在他们心目中只有一个共同的想法，在比赛中不能落后，要为首都争取荣誉。比赛的结果，谁也没有想到既没有海、锻炼时间又短的北京水上运动代表队取得了总分第一，在荡桨舢舨、拔河和多项运动中都取得了冠军。
    今年7月，国家队来到了北京。年轻的选手们和老大哥举行男、女舢舨比赛时输了，但是他们的顽强毅力，受到了老大哥们的热烈赞扬。从此，北京市航海俱乐部的名气便在青岛、广州、上海等地的航海俱乐部传开了，谁都认为北京市水上运动队是一个顽强、有力的对手。
