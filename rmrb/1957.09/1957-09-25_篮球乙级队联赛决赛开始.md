Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 24th: The National Basketball League Second Division competition held in Xi'an has entered its final climax. In the past six days of competition, both the Jiangsu men's team and the Tianjin women's team have won all six of their matches.

    The Jiangsu team's technique has improved significantly compared to last year, consecutively defeating strong opponents such as Heilongjiang, the Railway team, and the Public Security Sports Association.

    The strength of the women's teams is comparable, and the competition is very intense. The Hebei team, which was originally expected to win, although it defeated four teams in a row, including the Railway team, the Power Sports Association, and the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education's second team, surprisingly lost to the Yunnan team with a score of 47 to 57 on the evening of the 22nd, and then lost to the Tianjin team on the 23rd. The Tianjin women's team was only formally established last year and is the team with the shortest history among the ten women's teams. All the players are secondary school students, with an average age of eighteen. This team has grown rapidly. In last year's national league, they only won eleventh place, but after a year of hard training, their athletic skills and physical strength have improved significantly. The league will conclude on schedule at the end of September.

    篮球乙级队联赛决赛开始
    据新华社西安24日电　在西安举行的全国篮球乙级队联赛已经进入决赛高潮。在六天来的比赛中，男子的江苏队和女子的天津队都六战六胜。
    江苏队的技术比去年又有很大进步，连续战胜了黑龙江、火车头、公安体育协会等强劲对手。
    女子队的实力不相上下，竞赛很激烈。人们原来估计很有可能取得优胜的河北队，虽然接连打败了火车头、动力体育协会、上海体育学院二队等四个队，22日晚上却首次以四十七对五十七的比数败给了云南队，23日又败于天津队。天津市女子队去年才正式成立，是十个女子队中历史最短的一个队。全部队员都是中等学校学生，平均年龄为十八岁，这个队成长很快，去年全国联赛中仅获得第十一名，但是经过一年来刻苦锻炼，她们的运动技术和体力有了显著的提高。联赛将在9月底按期结束。
