Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on September 19th that Dulles' recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly was "full of malice, threats, fabrications, and provocations towards Syria."

　　He said that this speech was the culmination of the American anti-Syrian movement.

　　Al-Assali said, "Regardless of what the United States intends, Syria is now prepared to repel any aggression and defend its independence, freedom, and territory by all means." He said that Syria would never relax its vigilance against imperialism because of optimism.

　　Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar commented on Dulles' speech on the 20th, saying that the so-called vacuum in this region mentioned by Dulles will only be filled by Arab nationalism. He accused the United States of using the so-called communist threat as an excuse to replace Britain and France in the Middle East.

　　Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party leader Hourani said on September 19th that Dulles' speech was full of lies and false facts, and it violated the United Nations Charter because his speech was threatening.

　　At the same time, Syrian and Egyptian newspapers published commentaries one after another, refuting Dulles' slander against the Soviet Union and Syria.

　　The Syrian "Al Ra'i Al Aam" pointed out, "Dulles should know that the Soviet Union has no bases here, and has no demands whatsoever, while the United States has many military bases around Syria." "Al Massa" said that this speech "is preparing for an imminent aggression, just as the United States did before invading Korea."

　　The Egyptian "Al-Ahram" ridiculed Dulles' speech as characterized by "his ability to present an inexhaustible number of fabrications in one speech." The newspaper said: Dulles talked about the Soviet Union selling weapons to Arab countries, but forgot that the United States provides weapons to Israel and its supporters in the Middle East for free. Dulles talked about the so-called Syrian threat to Turkey, but he forgot that Syria does not have troops on its northern border, while Turkish troops are moving south to the Syrian border in large numbers.

    叙总理严斥杜勒斯在联大的叫嚣
    指出美国反叙运动已到顶点
    叙利亚决不会放松对帝国主义的警惕
    本报综合报道　据新华社21日讯：叙利亚总理阿萨利9月19日说，杜勒斯最近在联合国大会上发表的演说“对叙利亚充满了恶意、威胁、捏造和挑衅。”
    他说，这篇演说是美国反叙利亚运动的顶点。
    阿萨利说，“不管美国打算怎样，现在叙利亚已准备好用一切办法击退任何侵略，保卫它的独立、自由和国土。”他说，叙利亚决不会因为乐观而放松了对帝国主义的警惕。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔20日评论杜勒斯演说说，杜勒斯谈到的这个地区的所谓真空将只会由阿拉伯民族主义来填补。他指责美国利用所谓共产党的威胁作为借口想在中东取英法而代之。
    阿拉伯复兴社会党领袖胡拉尼9月19日说，杜勒斯这篇演说充满了谎言和错误的事实，它违反了联合国宪章，因为他的演说是威胁性的。
    与此同时，叙利亚和埃及的报纸纷纷发表评论，驳斥了杜勒斯对苏联和叙利亚的诽谤。
    叙利亚“舆论报”指出，“杜勒斯应当知道苏联在这里没有基地，并且也没有任何要求，而美国在叙利亚周围有很多军事基地。”“群众报”说，这个演说“是为即将来临的侵略进行准备，正如美国在侵略朝鲜之前所做的一样。”
    埃及“金字塔报”嘲笑杜勒斯这篇演说的特点是“他竟能够在一篇演说中提出多到无法再多的虚构捏造”。这家报纸说：杜勒斯谈到了苏联卖武器给阿拉伯国家，可是却忘记了美国免费送武器给以色列和它在中东的支持者。杜勒斯谈到了所谓叙利亚对土耳其的威胁，但是，他却忘记了叙利亚在北部边境上并没有军队，而土耳其军队却大量向南开往叙利亚的边境。
