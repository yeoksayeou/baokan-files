Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: The Chinese Committee for the Commemoration of World Cultural Figures in 1957 will continue to hold commemorative activities for world cultural figures in Beijing this month.

The commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus will be held on the evening of September 12th at the auditorium of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies, together with the four organizers—the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences—as well as relevant societies, have held three preparatory meetings. It was decided to invite scientist Zhu Kezhen to chair the opening of the commemoration on behalf of the four organizers; invite Mr. Book, the Swedish Ambassador to China, to deliver a speech; and invite experts in botany and zoology to give reports on Linnaeus's life and his contributions to botany and zoology. After the meeting, Swedish music records will be played, and Chinese scientific and technological films will be screened. To coordinate the commemoration and conduct international academic exchange, a special issue of the commemoration will also be compiled and printed. In addition, before the commemoration, Wang Zhenru, a director of the Chinese Botanical Society and a professor at the Beijing Forestry Institute, will give a report on Linnaeus's life on the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

The commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Italian playwright Carlo Goldoni will be held on September 28th at the Beijing Experimental Theater. Playwright Tian Han will chair the commemoration on behalf of the five organizers—the Chinese Dramatists Association, China and Foreign countries, and the Association for Cultural Exchanges with Foreign Countries, and invite director Jiao Juyin to give a brief report. The three-act play "The Mistress of the Inn" by Goldoni, rehearsed by the Central Academy of Drama under the guidance of Soviet experts, will be performed for the first time at this commemoration. To coordinate the commemoration, the Beijing Library will hold a mass report meeting on Goldoni's creative life before and after the commemoration, at which excerpts from Goldoni's plays will be performed or recited. In addition, the People's Literature Publishing House has translated and published a selection of Goldoni's plays, and the China Drama Publishing House has published four other Goldoni plays.

In late September, a comprehensive exhibition of commemorative materials for the seven world cultural figures of this year will also be held at the Beijing Library.
