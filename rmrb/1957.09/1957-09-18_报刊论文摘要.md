Newspaper Article Abstract
Our world is the people's world led by the Party

    争天下 (Zhēng tiānxià), seizing power, this is the focus of the political struggle launched by the rightists. Is it the people's world led by the Communist Party, or the anti-people's world led by the rightists? We say: the system of people's democratic dictatorship is very good; the rightists say: the Western democratic system is very good. This is a struggle between two roads, and it is the most fundamental difference.

    Today, the rightists have a common characteristic, that is, they do not admit in words that they want to change the dynasty and take the capitalist road. They say: "I also agree with socialism, but I only ask to improve the proletarian dictatorship system." This is just a deceptive lie. All the fallacies of the rightists regarding the "Party's world" ultimately focus on opposing the proletarian dictatorship. The fundamental point of disagreement between us and the rightists is the issue of whether or not to have a proletarian dictatorship.

    The people's democratic dictatorship and the leadership of the Communist Party are inseparable. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship, or the proletarian dictatorship, becomes empty talk. Overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party means overthrowing the people's democratic dictatorship.

    In order to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, the first common argument used by the rightists is: "You are all of one color," "You rule everything." The rightists say they are against "all of one color," but in reality, they are against "one color," that is, against red, and attempt to establish a white all of one color. The Chinese people urgently need to cultivate a large number of red experts and leading talents in order to consolidate the red leadership.

    The second argument is: "You don't separate the Party from the government," "The Party replaces the government." In fact, in our country, the Communist Party and the government are very clearly separated; the Communist Party is also very clearly separated from the army, economic organs, cultural organs, and people's organizations; they all have their own independent systems, and no one has ever said that the Communist Party should be used to replace the government, or replace all other organizations. It is very clear that the rightists' attack is actually against the Communist Party leading the government, and they want to completely separate the Communist Party from the government. We believe that the Communist Party is the core of the people's democratic dictatorship. In terms of general policy and general line, in terms of work guidelines, and in terms of the direction of action, it is completely correct and necessary for the "Party and government to be inseparable" and fused into one.

    The third argument is: "You only want us to carry the flag and hold the umbrella." People know that the people's democratic dictatorship not only needs the strong leadership of the proletariat and its political party, but also needs the proletariat and the broad masses of the people to form a solid alliance. Everyone knows that many non-Party members hold important positions in our state organs, and non-Party members account for more than 40% of the delegates to the National People's Congress in our country. Can this be called "carrying the flag and holding the umbrella"? Even if it is "carrying the flag and holding the umbrella," if you are unwilling to "carry the flag and hold the umbrella" for the people, do you want to carry the flag and hold the umbrella for imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek again?

    The fourth argument is: "You monopolize the power to appoint people," "You are a new dynasty with a new emperor." What is leadership? Chairman Mao once popularly defined it as: giving ideas and using cadres. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship system, to ensure the implementation of the Communist Party's political line, and to realize the Party's leading role in state power, the Communist Party must grasp the power to appoint people, but not "monopolize" it. Anyone who holds this "power" must be bound by the country's cadre policy and personnel system. No one's power to appoint people can have the power to arbitrarily appoint counter-revolutionary elements; cannot have the power to arbitrarily appoint anti-socialist elements; cannot have the power to arbitrarily appoint private individuals. Otherwise, wouldn't the nature of our country change? From the point of view that we are the first dynasty in Chinese history to basically eliminate the exploitation system, this is indeed the most profound change of dynasty in Chinese history, but today's "emperor" is the working class-led masses of the people. The working class has no selfishness. As long as people from any other class origin are not enemies, as long as they abandon their original positions, they can become members of the working class. This elimination of class boundaries is precisely the historical mission of the working class. Where can we talk about "a new dynasty with a new emperor"?

    The matter is very clear. The fundamental disagreement between us and the rightists, the central content of our struggle with the rightists, is the issue of who owns the "world." We are fighting for the world for the people, while the rightists are fighting for the world for the bourgeoisie.

专栏：报刊论文摘要

　　报刊论文摘要
　　我们的天下，是党领导的人民天下
    争天下，夺取政权，这就是右派分子发动的这一场政治斗争的焦点。是共产党领导的人民的天下呢，还是右派领导的反人民的天下呢？我们说：人民民主专政的制度好得很；右派说：西方民主制度好得很。这是两条道路的斗争，这是一个最根本的分歧。
    今天右派分子有一个共同特点，就是口头上并不承认他们是要改朝换代，走资本主义道路的，他们说：“我也是赞成社会主义的，只是要求把无产阶级专政制度改良一下而已”。这不过是骗人的鬼话。右派分子一切有关“党天下”的谬论，归根结底，就是集中于反对无产阶级专政。我们和右派分子的根本分歧之点，都是在要不要无产阶级专政这个问题上。
    人民民主专政和共产党的领导权是不可分离的。没有共产党的领导权，人民民主专政，或是无产阶级专政就变成一句空话。推翻共产党的领导，也就是推翻人民民主专政。
    为了反对共产党的领导权，右派分子通用的第一个说法是：“你们清一色”、“你们统治一切”。右派说是反对“清一色”，实际上是反对“一色”，就是反对红色，而企图建立白色的清一色。中国人民为了巩固红色的领导权，迫切需要大量培养红色专家和领导人才。
    第二个说法是：“你们党政不分”，“以党代政”。事实上，在我国，共产党和政权是分得很清楚的；共产党和军队，和经济机关，和文化机关，和人民团体，也是分得很清楚的；它们都有各自的独立系统，从来没有人说过，要用共产党去代替政权，代替其他的一切组织。很清楚，右派的攻击实际上就是反对共产党领导政权，他们想把共产党和政权完全分家。我们认为，共产党是人民民主专政的核心，在总政策总路线方面，在工作方针方面，在行动方向方面，“党政不分”，溶成一片，是完全正确的，必要的。
    第三个说法是：“你们只要我们扛旗打伞。”人们知道：人民民主专政不但需要无产阶级及其政党的坚强领导，而且还需要无产阶级和广大的人民群众结成巩固的联盟。谁都知道，许多非党人士在我们国家机关中担任着重要职务，在我国人民代表大会的代表名额中，非党人士占到40％以上。这能叫“扛旗打伞”吗？就算是“扛旗打伞”，你们不愿意为人民“扛旗打伞”，难道你们愿意重新再给帝国主义和蒋介石“扛旗打伞”吗？
    第四个说法是：“你们独揽用人权”，“你们是一朝天子一朝臣”。什么叫领导？毛主席曾经通俗地规定为：出主意，用干部。为了巩固人民民主专政制度，为了保证共产党的政治路线得到贯彻，实现党对国家政权的领导作用，共产党必须掌握用人权，但不是“独揽”。任何人掌握着这个“权”，都要受国家的干部政策和人事制度的约束。任何人的用人权，不能有随意任用反革命分子之权；不能有随意任用反对社会主义分子之权；不能有随意任用私人之权。否则，我们国家的性质岂不是要变质？从我们是中国历史上第一个基本上消灭了剥削制度的朝代来说，这的确是中国历史上最深刻的一次改朝换代，但是今天的“天子”是工人阶级领导的人民群众，工人阶级没有任何私心，对待任何别的阶级出身的人，只要不是敌人，只要他们抛弃自己原来的立场，便都可以成为工人阶级的一员，这种阶级界限的消灭，正是工人阶级的历史使命，哪里谈得到“一朝天子一朝臣”？
    事情是非常清楚的，我们和右派的根本分歧，我们和右派斗争的中心内容，就是争的“天下谁属”的问题。我们是为人民争天下，而右派分子是为资产阶级争天下。（摘自中国青年报9月5日王力：“论党领导的人民天下”）
