    Zhang Tuo Wants to be an Anti-Communist "Hero"
    Workers of Xinjiang Nonferrous Metals Company Wage a Reasoning Struggle Against Him
    (Our dispatch) Urumqi – Zhang Tuo, an accountant and rightist element in the Xinjiang Nonferrous Metals Company, consistently provoked relations between leaders and the masses in his work, and insulted Party members, Youth League members, and activists. During the "blooming and contending" period in Urumqi, he openly demanded the establishment of a "Company Management Committee," advocating that "we must have our people participating." He said that the speeches of the rightists "spoke what was in my heart." After the counterattack against the rightists began, he was extremely dissatisfied, believing it was "a trap set by the Party Committee." He protested against the criticisms in the newspapers of the fallacies of Ge Peiqi and Chu Anping, saying it was "the old woman Wang scolding in the street." It has been revealed that Zhang Tuo was expelled from the Jinan Railway Administration system for violating laws and regulations and refusing to change despite repeated education. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, he harbored resentment because the Nonferrous Metals Company had investigated his history. Therefore, he had always adopted a hostile attitude towards the Party.
    His hatred of the Party was fully exposed in his diary, which he handed over during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. For example, in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was just proclaimed and the people of the whole country were immensely happy, this rightist element thought completely differently from the broad masses. In his diary on November 18 of that year, he wrote: "...Cry, who can I cry to? Who will sympathize with our tears? In order to survive, in order to live better in society, we must resist, we must cut our shackles and be free and happy people forever."
    Let's read on: "Bite your teeth and endure this moment, only with this opportunity can you be proud. If you want to explore the deep mountains, you must play with tigers, changing dynasties is called a hero." (February 3, 1951)
    "Old Duan from the motorcade got married. Because he is neither a Party member nor a League member, I attended, not only attended, but was one of the most lively." (November 1951, date not specified)
    "Oh, the times! Turn around! So that these suffering petty bourgeoisie will also have a day to hold their heads high." (December 2, 1953)
    "The proof of the past few years has made me change my original vision. What progress! What activeness! Are just credentials for eating." (May 21, 1954)
    "How can vulgar and lowly people understand the great ambitions of a roc. ...Where can a hero use his martial prowess? Summon up courage, endure the anger in your heart, learn from the ancients who slept on firewood and tasted gall, suffering their hearts and minds. When the time comes, let these immeasurable villains die in an unknown place." (December 31, 1954)
    When the workers of the Nonferrous Metals Company saw that this rightist element harbored such deep hatred for the Party and socialism, they were extremely indignant and are actively launching a reasoning struggle against him. (Shen Shi)

    张拓要作反共的“英豪”
    新疆有色公司职工对他开展说理斗争
    本报讯　新疆有色金属公司会计、右派分子张拓，在工作中一贯挑拨领导和群众的关系，辱骂党、团员和积极分子。当乌鲁木齐在“鸣”、“放”期间，他公开要求成立“公司管理委员会”，主张“要有我们的人参加”。说右派分子的发言“道出了我心里的话”。反击右派开始以后，他极为不满，认为这是“党委设好的圈套”。他对报纸反击葛佩琦、储安平的谬论鸣不平，说这是“王婆骂街。”据揭露，张拓在济南铁路管理局系统中工作时，曾因违法乱纪，几经教育不改被开除。在肃反运动中，又因有色公司审查过他的历史而怀恨在心。因此，一直对党采取仇视态度。
    他仇恨党的情绪，肃反时在他自己交出来的日记中全部暴露了出来。例如，在1949年中华人民共和国刚宣告成立，全国人民万分欢欣的时候，这个右派分子就同广大群众所想的全然不同。他在这年11月18日的日记中写道：“……哭，我向谁哭，谁会同情我们的眼泪，为了生存，为了更好的在社会上求生，我们要抵抗，我们要把我们的绳锁切断，永远作自由幸福的人。”
    我们再往下看：“咬紧牙关挨此时，有此机会方能骄，欲探深山必戏虎，改朝换代称英豪”。（1951年2月3日）
    “汽车队的老段结婚，因为他非党非团，所以参加了，不光参加了，而是最热闹的一个。”（1951年11月，未注明日期）
    “时代呀！转吧！使这些受苦的小资产阶级也有一天扬眉吐气的时候。”（ 1953年12月2日）
    “几年来的证明，使我改变了原有的视力，什么进步呀！积极呀！只是吃饭的凭证。”（1954年5月21日）
    “低级庸俗的人儿，怎能了解长鹏的雄志。……英雄何地用武，鼓起胸志，忍耐心头之气，学昔人卧薪尝胆，苦其心志，到时候，让这些无量小人，死于非地。”（1954年12月31日）
    有色公司职工看到这个右派分子对党对社会主义抱着如此深厚的仇恨，都极为愤慨，正积极对他展开说理斗争。（沈石）
