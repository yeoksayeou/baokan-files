Cultivating Labor Concepts and Learning Production Knowledge
Many Middle Schools in Beijing Offer Production Internship Courses

    (Our report) Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, according to the Ministry of Education's instruction on implementing basic production technology education in ordinary middle schools, has focused on adding industrial production internship courses in fifty-eight middle schools over the past year.

    These schools, based on the varying course loads of each grade level, have added metalworking and woodworking internship courses in junior high schools; machine work and fitting internship courses in the first year of senior high school; automobile internship courses in the second year of senior high school; and electrical work internship courses in the third year of senior high school. Through internship courses, students have grasped some basic production knowledge and learned some simple skills and design abilities. At the same time, it has also cultivated students' interest in physical labor and established correct labor concepts; in labor, they have also received education in collectivist spirit and the moral qualities of cherishing public property.

    These schools, in accordance with the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily, have converted classrooms, dormitories, and warehouses into factory buildings. The equipment in the factories is also made using old machines, etc. Before building the factories, the schools established contact with some factories and enterprises to seek their help. For example, Beijing No. 14 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, and No. 101 Middle School have established close relationships with Universal Machine Factory, Second Machine Tool Factory, etc. The factories gave some unsuitable machines and tools to the schools for students to use for internships. Workers used their spare time to repair and install machines for the schools. The raw materials used for internships were mostly waste materials purchased from factories. Most of the internship teachers are physics teachers from the school who also serve after short-term training.

    Students all love production internship courses. They unanimously feel that they have learned real knowledge from the internship courses and strengthened their labor concepts.

    培养劳动观念学习生产知识
    北京许多中学开设生产实习课
    本报讯　北京市教育局根据教育部关于在普通中学实施基本生产技术教育的指示，一年来有重点地在五十八个中学里增设了工业生产实习课。
    这些学校根据各年级课程轻重不同情况，在初中增设了金工、木工实习课；高中一年级增设了机工、钳工实习课，高中二年级增设了汽车实习课；高中三年级增设了电工实习课。通过实习课，使学生们掌握了一些生产基础知识，学会了一些简单的技术和设计能力。同时，也培养了学生对于体力劳动的兴趣，树立了正确的劳动观念；在劳动中并受到集体主义精神和爱护公共财物的道德品质的教育。
    这些学校根据勤俭办学的精神，利用教室、宿舍、仓库等改建成了厂房，厂内的设备也都是利用旧有的机器等。学校在建厂前和一些工厂、企业建立了联系，争取他们的帮助。如北京第十四中学、第八中学、一零一中学都和通用机器厂、第二机床厂等建立了密切的关系。工厂把一些不适用的机器、工具送给学校，作为学生实习用。工人们用业余时间给学校修理、安装机器。实习用的原料大都是从工厂里收买的废料。实习课教师大部分是本校物理课教师经过短期训练兼任的。
    学生们都喜爱生产实习课。他们一致感到从实习课中学到了真正的知识，加强了劳动观念。（戴月）
