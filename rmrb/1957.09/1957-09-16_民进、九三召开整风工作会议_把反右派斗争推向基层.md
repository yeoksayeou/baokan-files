Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The national rectification work conference convened by the China Association for Promoting Democracy (Minjin) opened in Beijing this morning.

　　Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, due to illness, entrusted Yang Dongchun, Secretary-General of Minjin, to read a written speech, pointing out that this rectification work conference is a historical and severe test for Minjin.

　　Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of Minjin, said in his opening speech: The primary task of this meeting is to analyze the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle within Minjin, clarify the guiding ideology, overcome various ideological obstacles, and push the anti-Rightist struggle comprehensively and deeply to the grassroots level, so that every grassroots unit and every member can receive profound education and thoroughly defeat the Rightists.

　　Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of Minjin, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of Minjin and the Central Rectification Leading Group, made a speech at the meeting entitled "Fully Launch and Thoroughly Deepen the Anti-Rightist Struggle, and Fight to Complete Our Serious Tasks." Zhou Jianren said that after more than two months of anti-Rightist struggle, it has proved that all kinds of erroneous estimates that Minjin's problems were not significant and that the anti-Rightist struggle was "almost over" were completely unfounded. He pointed out that various ideological concerns, varying in degree and manifestation, still existed in the leadership organs and members at all levels of Minjin. Zhou Jianren said that these were all manifestations of right-leaning thought and were the main stumbling blocks to the further comprehensive and in-depth development of the anti-Rightist struggle. If this stumbling block was not removed, it would seriously affect the in-depth development of the anti-Rightist struggle and would cause Minjin to make an unforgivable mistake politically.

　　Zhou Jianren pointed out that the urgent task of Minjin at present is to continue to vigorously overcome right-leaning thoughts and shortcomings in work on the basis of the initial victory that has been achieved, and while continuing to deepen the struggle in the leading organs from the central to the local levels, actively and step by step deepen the struggle into all grassroots organizations. And on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, through general rectification, cleaning up the grassroots, and consolidating the organization, etc., Minjin will undergo essential transformation and become a political force that forever follows the Communist Party and truly serves socialism.

　　Attending the meeting were the heads of the rectification leading bodies of the Central Committee of Minjin and the local organizations and directly affiliated groups of 24 provinces and cities across the country, as well as members of the Central Committee in Beijing, alternate members of the Central Committee, and heads of various work departments of the Central Committee, totaling 83 people.

　　The meeting will continue.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The national rectification work conference of the Jiusan Society opened in Beijing on September 15th. Attending the meeting were members of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, alternate members of the Central Committee, and representatives of the rectification leading bodies of various local organizations, totaling more than 70 people. The meeting was presided over by Tu Changwang, Deputy Director of the Central Rectification Work Committee of the Jiusan Society.

　　Liang Xi, Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society and Deputy Director of the Central Rectification Work Committee, made a report at the meeting. He said: Rectification and the struggle against bourgeois Rightists are the key to thoroughly transforming the Jiusan Society into a genuine political party serving socialism, and it is also the key for every member to truly transform into a socialist intellectual. The facts that have been revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle have proved that the problems of the Jiusan Society are very serious. For more than a year, the organizations at all levels of the Jiusan Society, with the exception of individual cases, have formed a situation of "everything for development, and development is everything" in their actual work. This is a serious right-leaning in political line and organizational line. The evil large-scale development policy insisted on by Chairman Xu Deheng specifically reflected this situation and provided a breeding ground for the rampant anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities of the Rightists. The swing to the right after the high tide of socialist transformation, the rampant anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities of the Rightists during the blooming and contending period, and the confusion and wavering of the middle-of-the-roaders specifically show that the Jiusan Society is still a bourgeois party in general.

　　Liang Xi said: The anti-Rightist struggle is the key and decisive step in the entire rectification movement of the Jiusan Society, and it is a turning point for the fundamental transformation of the Jiusan Society. The current serious political task of the Jiusan Society is to carry out this work in depth, and it must go all out and carry it through to the end.

　　Liang Xi pointed out: Although the Jiusan Society has achieved initial results in the anti-Rightist struggle, it is still very superficial and not universal. The exposure and criticism of the Rightists are mostly not deep or thorough enough, and the development of the anti-Rightist struggle in various regions is also uneven.

　　Liang Xi said: Being soft on the Rightists is being ruthless to the people. In the face of such a major event, devoting enough time and making the greatest effort is the unavoidable responsibility of everyone.

　　Finally, Liang Xi pointed out: In the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification work, the organizations at all levels of the Jiusan Society must form a leading core that stands firmly on the socialist position and resolutely accepts the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

### 民进、九三召开整风工作会议  把反右派斗争推向基层

　　民进、九三召开整风工作会议
　　把反右派斗争推向基层
    据新华社15日讯  中国民主促进会召开的全国整风工作会议，今天上午在北京开幕。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦因病委托民进秘书长杨东蓴宣读了书面讲话，指出这次整风工作会议对于民进是历史性的严重考验。
    民进副主席王绍鏊在开幕词中说：这次会议的首要任务，就是要分析民进会内反右派斗争的情况，明确领导思想，克服各种思想障碍，把反右派斗争全面、深入地推向基层，使得每一个基层、每一个会员都能受到深刻的教育，彻底地打垮右派分子。
    民进副主席周建人代表民进中央常务委员会和中央整风领导小组，在会上作了题为“全面展开、彻底深入反右派斗争，为完成我们的严重任务而战斗”的发言。周建人说，经过两个多月来的反右派斗争，证明了一切认为民进问题不大，反右派斗争已经“差不多了”等种种错误估计是完全没有根据的。他指出民进在各级领导机关和成员中还存在着程度不一，表现不同的各种思想顾虑。周建人说，这都是右倾思想的表现，是反右派斗争进一步全面、深入地展开的主要绊脚石，如果不搬掉这个绊脚石，就将严重影响反右派斗争的深入和展开，就将使民进在政治上犯不可饶恕的错误。
    周建人指出，民进当前的迫切任务就是要在已经取得的初步胜利的基础上，继续大力克服右倾思想和工作中的缺点，在从中央到地方领导机关继续深入斗争的同时，积极地和有步骤地把斗争深入到一切基层组织中去。并且在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，通过一般的整风、清理基层、整顿组织等步骤，使民进经过本质的改造，成为永远跟着共产党走的、真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。
    出席这次会议的有民进中央和全国二十四个省、市地方组织和直属小组的整风领导机构负责人，还有在北京的中央委员、候补中央委员和中央各工作部门负责人等共八十三人。
    会议将继续举行。
    据新华社15日讯  九三学社全国整风工作会议9月15日在北京开幕。出席这次会议的有九三学社中央委员、候补中央委员和各地方组织整风领导机构的代表共七十多人。会议由九三学社中央整风工作委员会副主任委员涂长望主持。
    九三学社副主席、中央整风工作委员会副主任委员梁希在会上作了报告。他说：整风和反对资产阶级右派的斗争，对九三学社来说，是彻底改造成为真正的为社会主义服务的政党的关键，也是每一个社员真正改造成为社会主义知识分子的关键。在反右派斗争中已经揭露的事实证明九三学社的问题是十分严重的。一年多来，九三学社各级组织除了个别例外，在实际工作中形成了“一切为了发展，发展就是一切”的局面。这是政治路线和组织路线上的严重右倾。许德珩主席所坚持的恶性大发展方针就具体的反映了这一情况，并为右派分子的猖獗的反共反社会主义的活动提供了培育基地。在社会主义改造高潮以后的向右摇摆，和大鸣大放期间右派分子猖狂反共反社会主义，以及中间分子的迷惑动摇，具体地说明九三学社在总的方面还是资产阶级性的政党。
    梁希说：反右派斗争是九三学社整个整风运动的关键和决定性步骤，是九三学社进行根本改造的转折点。九三学社当前的严重的政治任务就是深入开展这一工作，必须全力以赴，把它进行到底。
    梁希指出：九三学社反右派斗争虽已获得初步战果，但是还很不深入和普遍，对右派分子的揭露批判，多数还不深不透，各地反右派斗争发展情况也不平衡。
    梁希说：对右派的温情，就是对人民无情。在这样大事面前，付出足够的时间，作出最大的努力，是每一个人不可逃避的责任。
    最后，梁希指出：九三学社各级组织在反右派斗争和整风工作中，必须组成站稳社会主义立场的领导核心，坚决接受中国共产党的领导。
