President Nasser Attends Opening Ceremony

On the evening of September 16th, the "Opera" cinema in Cairo was decorated in the Chinese style, with two red lanterns and the national flags of China and Egypt hanging at the entrance. The stage inside the cinema also displayed the national flags of China and Egypt. Suddenly, President Nasser, a familiar, robust figure to the Egyptians, walked into the cinema. The Egyptians attending the opening ceremony of the Chinese Film Festival immediately cheered him, and he smiled and waved in response.

President Nasser had never attended any film festivals before. This evening, he attended the opening ceremony of the week-long Chinese Film Festival, watched the Chinese film "The New Year's Sacrifice," and met with the Chinese film delegation.

Egyptian public opinion highly valued President Nasser's friendly gesture towards the Chinese people. "Al-Gomhuria" stated that this was President Nasser's cordial tribute to the art of a friendly nation's people, and also a vivid expression of the further consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian peoples, as well as the Egyptians' pure affection and respect for the Chinese.

At the same time, Egyptian newspapers also mentioned that the Egyptian Film Week was scheduled to open in Beijing on September 28th, believing that the mutual holding of film festivals by China and Egypt was of great significance and a gratifying event for the increasingly close friendship between the two peoples.

Thus, several Chinese films, including "The New Year's Sacrifice," "Guerrillas on the Plain," "Hassan and Naima," and "The Fairy Couple," began to meet with Egyptian friends in such a friendly and warm atmosphere.

Resonance of Shared Emotions

In the cinema, Chinese films closely captivated the emotions of Egyptian audiences who paid close attention to the plot twists, making them feel as if they were breathing together with the Chinese people. The film audiences here usually do not applaud much. However, when the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army appeared on the screen at a very critical moment, thunderous applause erupted from the audience, sometimes lasting for several minutes. The audience laughed when they saw the Japanese commander's embarrassed appearance in the film "Guerrillas on the Plain." Sometimes, sounds of satisfaction or regret could also be heard from the audience.

At the same time, the popularity of Chinese films among the Egyptian people can also be seen from the demands put forward by Egyptian film distribution agents. The representative of the China Film Distribution Company in Cairo met with many agents during the Chinese Film Festival. They were willing to pay a high price to obtain the screening rights. Some people requested the rights to screen Chinese films in Egypt, Sudan, and Libya, while others requested the rights to screen Chinese films throughout the Arab world.

Egyptian Friends Pay Attention to the Characteristics of Chinese Films

The Egyptian people are no strangers to new Chinese films, because "Chicken Feather Letter," which was publicly screened in Cairo and other places during their resistance against the Anglo-French invaders, had left a deep impression on them. This screening of films gave them a deeper impression of the characteristics of Chinese films.

At a banquet held by Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Chen Jiakang for the Egyptian film delegation visiting China, the reporter asked Egyptian Minister of National Guidance Radwan for his opinion on Chinese films. He said: "Your performances are serious and authentic, free from foreign influences. Your actors know how to express life in their own way." He also said: "The colors of Chinese films are soft, bright, and realistic. The lighting and photography are also very good. As for the stories, they are all serious and meaningful, unlike American films that only use glibness, pornography, and cheap humor to please the audience."

Minister Radwan also expressed his opinions on the shortcomings of Chinese films. He believed that Chinese films had too many details in the story, slow story development, and a lack of action.

He also told me that once he took his whole family to see "Hassan and Naima," and his twelve-year-old child couldn't help but shed tears when he saw the Kuomintang bandit soldiers throwing Hassan and Naima's son to the ground.

Mohaiddin, a member of parliament and editor-in-chief of "Al Masaa," who recently returned from a visit to China, said that he was deeply moved after watching "The New Year's Sacrifice," which reminded him of the Egyptian peasants under the yoke of Farouk and imperialism. At that time, many Egyptian peasants had the same fate as the heroine in "The New Year's Sacrifice."

Egyptian film critic and documentary director Sateh Nadim said that some people say that the themes of Chinese films are too straightforward and too simple. He said that such criticism is obviously due to watching American films. In fact, Egyptians need films with straightforward themes and films that depict the real lives of the people. He said that screening Chinese films, which are healthy in all aspects, can somewhat offset the bad influence of American films.

Egyptian newspapers also introduced the characteristics of Chinese films to readers in great detail. The newspapers emphasized that Chinese films serve as a tool for educating the people, consolidating the victories achieved by the people, and improving the cultural life of the people. The newspapers said that the themes, screenwriting, directing, and acting techniques of Chinese films all have realistic tendencies.

Chinese Film Delegation Welcomed Everywhere

The Chinese film delegation, as representatives of the Chinese people and film workers, was also warmly welcomed in Egypt. On September 16th, the day of the film festival's opening, President Nasser received the Chinese representatives twice. He expressed his welcome and gratitude to them. On September 20th, President Nasser's wife specially held a tea party to entertain Ambassador Chen Jiakang's wife and film actresses Bai Yang and Qin Yi. Mrs. Nasser told the Chinese guests that although she did not attend the opening ceremony of the film festival, the President had already told her the story of "The New Year's Sacrifice" and the situation of the two film actresses. Therefore, they already knew each other before meeting.

The Chinese guests spent a very pleasant evening with Mrs. Nasser and her five children in President Nasser's small villa. Mrs. Nasser asked Bai Yang to convey her respect to Chinese women. She also said that she hoped to visit China.

In addition to sightseeing, the Chinese representatives also received a large number of invitations to attend banquets and tea parties. Egyptian Minister of National Guidance Radwan also attended such receptions on many occasions. Talaat Harb, the most famous Egyptian and Arab writer of the time, who had always avoided public gatherings due to his blindness and old age, also attended a banquet to entertain the Chinese representatives this time.

Chinese artists and Egyptian film artists all expressed their hope to learn from each other and strengthen their cooperation. They unanimously agreed with the proposal to co-produce a film by artists from both countries. Everyone hoped that this plan would be realized through mutual visits by film delegations.

    埃及人欢迎中国电影
    新华社驻开罗记者　陈伯坚
    纳赛尔总统参加开幕式
    9月16日晚上，开罗的“歌剧”电影院按着中国风格装饰起来，门口挂着两盏红灯笼和中埃两国的国旗。电影院内的舞台上也挂着中埃两国的国旗。突然，埃及人所熟悉的身体魁梧的纳赛尔总统走进了电影院。参加中国电影节开幕式的埃及人立刻向他欢呼，他微笑着挥手答礼。
    纳赛尔总统过去没有参加过任何电影节。这一天晚上，他参加了为时一星期的中国电影节的开幕式，看了中国电影“祝福”，并且接见了中国电影代表团。
    埃及舆论十分重视纳赛尔总统对中国人民的这个友好表示。“共和国报”说，这是纳赛尔总统对一个友好国家人民的艺术的亲切致敬，同时也是中埃两国人民的友谊进一步巩固，以及埃及人对中国人的纯洁的友爱和尊敬的生动表现。
    同时，埃及报纸也提到埃及电影周预订9月28日在北京开幕；认为中埃两国相互举行电影节具有重大意义，是两国人民间日益亲密的友谊的可喜事件。
    就这样，“祝福”、“平原游击队”、“哈森与加米拉”和“天仙配”等几部中国影片，在埃及人民这样友好的热烈气氛中开始相继同埃及朋友们见面。
    相同的感情在共鸣
    在电影院中，中国电影紧紧地抓住了密切注意情节转变的埃及观众的情绪，使他们仿佛同中国人民在一起呼吸。这里的电影观众通常是不大鼓掌的。但是当在非常紧急的关头银幕上出现了中国人民解放军部队时，观众中却发出了春雷一般的掌声，有时长达几分钟之久。观众在“平原游击队”电影中看到日本司令官的狼狈相时都大笑起来。有时又能够听到观众的表示满意或是惋惜的声音。
    同时，从埃及电影发行代理人所提出的要求方面也可以看到中国电影是受到埃及人民的欢迎的。中国电影发行公司驻开罗代表在中国电影节期间曾经接见了许多代理人。他们愿意付出很高的代价取得放映权。有些人要求在埃及以及苏丹和利比亚放映中国电影的放映权，还有一些人要求在整个阿拉伯世界放映中国电影的放映权。
    埃及朋友注意中国电影的特点
    埃及人民对于新中国电影已经并不陌生，因为在他们抵抗英法侵略者期间，在开罗等地公映的“鸡毛信”就曾经给他们留下深刻的印象。这一次放映的影片使他们获得了对于中国影片特点的更深的印象。
    在中国驻埃及大使陈家康为去中国访问的埃及电影代表团饯行的宴会上，记者曾经要求埃及国家指导部部长拉德温发表对中国电影的意见。他说：“你们的表演是严肃而真实的，摆脱了外国的影响。你们的演员知道怎样用他们自己的方式表现生活。”他还说：“中国电影的色彩是柔和、鲜明而真实的。灯光和摄影也很不错。至于故事也都严肃而富有意义，不像美国电影那样只用油滑、色情和廉价的幽默来讨好观众。”
    拉德温部长也对中国电影的缺点表示了意见。他认为，中国影片的故事的细节太多，故事发展迟缓和缺乏动作等。
    他还告诉我，有一次他带了全家去看“哈森与加米拉”，他的十二岁的孩子在看到国民党匪军把哈森和加米拉的儿子掼到地上时不禁掉下眼泪了。
    最近访问中国回来的议员、“晚报”主编毛希丁说，他看了“祝福”之后深受感动，它使他想起处在法鲁克和帝国主义桎梏下的埃及农民。那时候埃及的许多农民都有和“祝福”里女主人公相同的命运。
    埃及电影批评家和纪录片导演萨特·纳迪姆说，有些人说中国电影的主题太直率和过于简单。他说，像这样的批评显然是由于看了美国电影而产生的。事实上，埃及人需要有直率的主题和刻划人民的真实生活的电影。他说，放映在各方面都健康的中国电影多少可以抵销一些美国电影的坏影响。
    埃及各报也以很大的篇幅向读者介绍中国电影的特点。报纸强调中国电影是作为教育人民、巩固人民取得的胜利和提高人民文化生活水平的工具。报纸说，中国电影的主题、编剧、导演和表演技术都有现实主义倾向。
    中国电影代表团到处受欢迎
    作为中国人民和电影工作者的代表的中国电影代表团，在埃及也受到热烈的欢迎。在9月16日电影节开幕的那一天，纳赛尔总统两次接见了中国代表们。他对他们表示欢迎和感谢。9月20日，纳赛尔总统夫人又特别举行茶会招待陈家康大使夫人和电影女演员白杨和秦怡。纳赛尔夫人对中国客人们说，虽然她没有参加电影节的开幕仪式，但是总统已经把“祝福”的故事和两位电影女演员的情况都告诉她了。因此，她们在见面之前已经相识了。
    中国客人们在纳赛尔总统的小别墅里，同纳赛尔夫人和她的五个儿女一起度过了一个很愉快的晚上。纳赛尔夫人请白杨转达她对中国妇女的敬意。她还说她希望访问中国。
    除了观光外，中国代表们还接到大批请柬，邀请他们去出席宴会和茶会。埃及国家指导部部长拉德温也多次出席这种招待会。当代最著名的埃及和阿拉伯作家塔拉·侯赛尼由于双目失明，年事又高，向来不参加公众集会，但是他这次也出席了一次招待中国代表们的宴会。
    中国艺术家和埃及电影艺术家们都表示希望互相学习，并且加强他们的合作。他们一致同意由两国艺术家合作摄制一部影片的建议。大家都希望，这个计划将通过电影代表团的互相访问而得到实现。
