Clash of Ideologies
    —A Record of the Great Debate on Two Roads at the Huoxing Agricultural Cooperative in the Suburbs of Beijing
    By Our Correspondents Lin Xi and Yang Changfeng
    The bright autumn in Beijing, along with the bumper agricultural harvest, makes the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, who are busy with the autumn harvest, feel especially happy. During these joyful days, the thoughts of the members of the Huoxing Agricultural Cooperative in Machikou Township, Changping District, are far from calm. They spent more than a dozen nights refuting the capitalist rhetoric of a well-to-do middle peasant named Xu Rui.
    On the evening of September 19th, we caught up with the final debate refuting Xu Rui. More than eighty members from the three production teams of the Huoxing Cooperative participated in this meeting.
    More than half a month ago, Xu Rui, a rich middle peasant, said at a meeting of the Huoxing Cooperative members: "Cooperativization is a mess; the agricultural cooperative controls people so that they are 'prone on the ground.' The cooperative cadres have a string of petty labels, and they put them on whomever they like. The members have no freedom at all." These words of his sounded very unpleasant to most of the cooperative members, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    Last year, this area suffered severe flooding. The cooperative, by unifying the use of land and flexibly allocating labor, successfully overcame the disaster. People recalled that the flood last year was similar to the major floods of 1929 and 1939. In those two floods, how many families fled the famine, and how many sold their children, leading to family ruin and death! What about last year? Not a single family in the village fled the famine, and they continued to eat white flour and rice, ensuring a bumper harvest this year.
    However, how did Xu Rui view these achievements of the cooperative? He said, "In the past, during famine years, I could hire a long-term worker with a load of corn; I could pick an eighteen- or nineteen-year-old girl to be my wife with a few measures of grain." See how much he misses the "good old days" of being able to hire labor for exploitation! This "old codger" (as one woman called him), who is nearly sixty years old, still wants to take advantage of others' misfortunes and buy a young girl for his own pleasure! These ugly thoughts of his aroused the anger of the peasants who had already stood up. They naturally thought of the past.
    Mao San, who was sold to a landlord's family before liberation, said at the debate: "When I was three or four years old, my family had no food to eat, and my mother sold me to the Wang family, a landlord in Beizhuang Fucun, for fifteen yuan. More than a month later, my mother went to see me, and I secretly cried to her, 'Let me go home and drink elm leaf porridge with you.' My mother was extremely sad and decided to borrow money to redeem me. She asked people everywhere to plead and vouch for her, and as a result, the landlord demanded thirty yuan in redemption money. After liberation, my family was given land. Because we lacked farm tools and livestock, we had to beg people everywhere when it came to farming, which often delayed things. I was always running around but never had enough time... After joining the cooperative, I no longer had to ask anyone for help, and my life improved." At this point, Mao San asked old man Ma Yunlong, who was sitting next to him: "You watched me grow up, how is my life now compared to the past?" The seventy-year-old man smiled and said, "Not to make fun of you, but you didn't look like a person in the past! Now you're wearing a shirt and leather shoes, you're quite the handsome young man." "Xu Rui!" Mao San shouted excitedly, "You say cooperativization isn't good?"
    "Joining the cooperative is not as free as when I was working on my own. Whatever the team leader tells you to do, you have to do it; my wife is sick, and the cooperative won't give me any money," Xu Rui replied.
    "When you were working on your own, you hired a worker, and he had to do whatever you told him to do. You were very free, but the person who worked for you wasn't free."
    "Now the cooperative is so big, there's no unified leadership. People go to work in a chaotic rush, and they are all over the place in the fields. How can that work?"
    "You work hard, have strong labor, and have a good foundation at home. Why are you still asking the cooperative to pay for medical treatment? Besides, your wife doesn't have a serious illness. Mao Qingfeng's wife couldn't give birth, and the cooperative used a car to send her to Beijing for treatment, which cost more than three hundred yuan; if there were no cooperative, selling Mao Qingfeng's house and land wouldn't be enough to cover it."
    These words left Xu Rui speechless, but he was not convinced. He also said that "the cooperative cut down trees and left the land barren," and that "young people can't find wives"... Is this really the case? People retorted that, except for those who were not old enough to marry, almost all the young people present had started families. Individual cooperative members with low awareness secretly cut down trees, and the government and the cooperative stopped them in time. Why should this also be blamed on the cooperative? Besides, how many trees have been planted along the highway from Beijing to Changping in recent years? A piece of forest planted right next to this village has also grown up. It's just that Xu Rui is pretending not to see it. The cooperative turned dry land into paddy fields, and grain production increased. How can it be said that the land is barren?
    In recent years, people's lives have been getting better and better, and they rarely recall the past hardships. They did not expect that there are still some wealthy middle peasants today who want to get "rich" by exploitation. After this great debate, most people understood that taking the capitalist road would drag people back into a society where people exploit people. In the words of one cooperative member: "Capitalist thought is really stinky!"

    思想交锋
    ——记京郊火星农业社关于两条道路的大辩论
    本报记者　林晰　杨昌凤
    北京爽朗的秋天，农业上的大丰收，使正在忙于秋收的京郊农民感到格外愉快。在这令人喜悦的日子里，昌平区马池口乡火星农业社社员们的思想却很不平静。他们为了驳倒一个叫许瑞的富裕中农的资本主义言论，熬过了十几个深夜。
    9月19日晚上，我们赶上了最后驳倒许瑞的辩论会。参加这个会的，有火星社三个生产队的八十多名社员。
    半个多月前，富裕中农许瑞，在火星社社员的一次集会上说：“合作化搞糟了；农业社把人管得‘伏伏在地’，社干部提了一串小帽子，爱给谁扣就给谁扣，社员没有一点儿自由。”他的这些话，在绝大多数社员，特别是贫农和下中农社员们听来很不顺耳。
    去年，这一带遭受了严重的涝灾。合作社统一使用土地，灵活调配劳力，终于顺利地度过了灾荒。人们回忆说：去年的水灾同1929年、1939年两次大水灾的情况差不多。在那两次水灾当中，有多少户逃荒，多少人家卖了儿女，弄得家破人亡！去年呢？全村没有一户出外逃荒，而且白面、大米也不断吃，还保证了今年的大丰收。
    可是，许瑞怎么看待合作社的这些成绩？他说：“要在过去灾荒年呀，我一担棒子（玉米）可以雇个长年工；几斗粮食任我挑个十八九岁的大姑娘做媳妇。”看，他多么留恋旧社会能雇工剥削人的“好事”！这个年近六十岁的“糟老头子”（有位妇女这么称呼他），还想乘人之危买个大姑娘供自己玩弄呢！他的这些丑恶的思想，激起了已经翻了身的农民的愤怒。他们自然地想起了过去的日子。
    毛三，这个在解放前曾经被卖给地主家的孩子，在辩论会上说：“我三四岁的时候，家里没有饭吃，妈把我卖给了北庄阜村王家地主，得了十五块钱。一个多月以后，妈去看我，我偷偷地哭着对她说，还是让我回家跟你一起喝榆叶粥吧。妈妈难过极了，决心借钱把我赎回去。到处托人说情、做保，结果地主要回了三十块钱的赎身钱。解放以后，我家分了地。因为农具、牲畜都缺，一到耕地的时候就到处求人，常常误了事。闹得我紧奔紧不够，慢奔慢不够……入社以后，再也不求人，生活提高了。”这时，毛三问坐在他旁边的马云龙老伯：“你是看着我长大的，我现在的生活和过去比，怎么样？”这位七十多岁的人笑着说：“不是奚落你，过去呀，你哪像个人？现在穿着衬衣，蹬着皮鞋，可是个漂亮小伙子了。”“许瑞！”毛三激动地喊着说，“你说合作化怎么不好？”
    “入了合作社就是不如我单干的时候自由，队长叫干啥就得干啥；我老婆病了，社里也不给个钱。”许瑞答腔说。
    “你单干的时候雇个工，听你说干啥就得干啥，你倒是很自由，给你做活的人可不自由了。”
    “现在这么大个社，没有人统一领导，出工一窝蜂，下地乱哄哄，能行吗？”
    “你出工多，劳力强，家里有底，为什么还叫社里给出钱看病？再说，你老婆也不是害的了不起的病。人家毛庆峰老婆生孩子生不下来，社里用汽车送到北京治，花了三百多元；要是没有合作社，把毛庆峰的房子带地卖了也抵不上。”
    这些话驳得许瑞没话可说，但是他并不服气。又说什么“合作社把树砍了，把地荒了”，“青年人娶不上媳妇”……真是这样的吗？人们反驳他说：到会的青年人，除了不够结婚年龄的以外，差不多都成了家。个别社员觉悟不高偷砍了树，政府和合作社都及时制止了，为什么把这个也算在合作社的账上？再说，这几年从北京到昌平的公路两边种了多少树，就在这个村边上种的一片树也都长起来了，只是许瑞瞪眼装着看不见。社里把旱地变成水田，粮食增产了，怎么能说是荒了地？
    这几年来，人们的生活越过越好，对过去的苦难很少回忆了。他们没有想到今天还有一部分富裕中农在想靠剥削来使自己“发财”。经过这次大辩论，多数人懂得了走资本主义的路就是要把人们拖回人剥削人的社会。用一个社员的话来说：“资本主义思想真是臭得很！”（附图片）
