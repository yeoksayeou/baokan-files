Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Reply of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to the Supreme People's Court Regarding the Implementation of the Resolution on Death Penalty Cases to be Adjudicated or Approved by the Supreme People's Court.

To the Supreme People's Court:

Your report of July 26, 1957, on how to implement the "Resolution of the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress on Death Penalty Cases to be Adjudicated or Approved by the Supreme People's Court" has been received. The Standing Committee believes that, in accordance with the Court Organization Law, death penalty cases that are the responsibility of the Higher People's Court for approval or final judgment shall still be judged or reviewed by the Higher People's Court. If the Higher People's Court believes that a death sentence should be imposed, the case shall be submitted to the Supreme People's Court for approval before execution. If the Higher People's Court believes that a death sentence should not be imposed, the Higher People's Court shall, in accordance with the provisions of the law, return the case to the Lower People's Court for retrial or bring the case up for trial itself. This is the reply.
