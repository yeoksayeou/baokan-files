Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party—the Rectification Work Conference—concluded today after seven days of enthusiastic and earnest group discussions and plenary speeches.

The conference made a comprehensive analysis of the class foundation of the Zhi Gong Party and the significant meaning of the anti-Rightist struggle for the Zhi Gong Party. The attending representatives unanimously agreed that, under the current situation, the overriding and central task of the Zhi Gong Party is to launch a rectification movement centered on the anti-Rightist struggle. This is a serious task for the Zhi Gong Party at present, and a decisive step and turning point in whether the Zhi Gong Party can be transformed into a political force that truly serves socialism, thereby gaining the trust of the people and realizing the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party. It is also a noble duty and due responsibility that every member of the Zhi Gong Party cannot abandon. All representatives unanimously stated that the anti-Rightist struggle of the Zhi Gong Party must be fully launched and deepened into local grassroots organizations.

Through this conference, the representatives gained a further understanding of the serious significance, principles, policies, and direction of the rectification movement, thereby strengthening everyone's confidence and determination.

The conference finally unanimously adopted the resolution on rectification work and the summary of the conference. The resolution stated that although the Zhi Gong Party's anti-Rightist struggle began in June and has achieved initial victories in the central government and some regions, exposing and criticizing some Rightists, generally speaking, the struggle has not been deeply and universally launched, the development of the movement is still uneven, and some regions have not yet developed it well. The resolution called on Zhi Gong Party members to participate in the ranks of the anti-Rightist struggle with unparalleled courage and resolute will. First of all, it is necessary to overcome right-leaning viewpoints and sentimentalism, and to be determined to stand on the socialist position in the struggle and resolutely defeat the Rightists.

The resolution instructed the rectification leading groups in various regions to formulate specific and practical anti-Rightist rectification work plans, and to promptly promote the anti-Rightist rectification work in various regions to go deeper into the grassroots.

　　致公党整风工作会议闭幕
　　会议决议迅速把反右派斗争推向基层
    据新华社19日讯　中国致公党中央委员会第二次会议（扩大）——整风工作会议，经过七天热烈认真的小组讨论和大会发言后，在今天闭幕。
    会议对致公党的阶级基础和反右派斗争对致公党的重大意义作了全面的分析。到会代表们一致认为，在当前形势下，致公党的压倒一切的中心工作是开展以反右派斗争为中心内容的整风运动，这是致公党当前的严重任务，是致公党能否改造成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，从而取得人民的信任，实现同共产党长期共存、互相监督的方针的决定性步骤和转折点，也是致公党每一个成员都不能放弃的崇高的义务和应有的责任。全体代表一致表示，必须把致公党的反右派斗争全面展开，并深入到各地方基层组织中去。
    通过这次会议，代表们对整风运动的严重意义和方针、政策、方向都有了进一步的认识，从而坚定了大家的信心和决心。
    会议最后一致通过了关于整风工作的决议和大会总结。决议说，致公党的反右派斗争虽然在6月间即已开始，并已在中央及某些地区取得了初步的胜利，揭露和批判了一些右派分子。但总的说来，斗争并未深入和普遍展开，运动的发展仍然不平衡，有些地区还未很好地展开。决议号召致公党成员以无比的勇敢和坚决的意志参加到反右派斗争的行列，首先是要克服右倾观点与温情主义，并在斗争中下定决心站到社会主义立场，坚决打垮右派分子。
    决议责成各地整风领导小组作出具体而切合实际的反右派整风工作计划，从速推动各地的反右派整风工作深入到基层去。
