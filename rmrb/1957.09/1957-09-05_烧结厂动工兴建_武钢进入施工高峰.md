    Sintering Plant Begins Construction
    Wuhan Steel Enters Construction Peak

    (Our Dispatch) Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise's sintering plant began construction on September 2. This is one of the five major plant buildings under construction at Wuhan Steel this year. To date, twenty system-wide projects are under full-scale construction at Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise.

    The task of the sintering plant is to sinter lean iron ore into artificial rich iron ore, which is then supplied to the blast furnace for smelting to ensure the quality of the iron. The Wuhan Steel sintering plant has three main parts: the concentrate system, the batching system, and the main plant building. Construction began on September 2 on the reinforced concrete foundation project for the receiving ore trough of the batching system; prior to this, earthwork had begun on seven projects, including the rotary car dumper room of the concentrate system and the foundation of the main plant building. This plant is scheduled to go into production in the first quarter of 1959.

    In September, Wuhan Steel's construction projects began to enter a peak period. Standing on the roof of the thermal power plant and looking out over the entire Wuhan Steel construction site, rows of factory building columns and tall cranes have been erected on the newly excavated hills. The roads and railways crisscrossing the factory area form a dense transportation network, with trains and trucks carrying various building materials and machinery and equipment in an endless stream. This is a construction project centered around the four main plant buildings. The central iron smelting plant is under intense construction. The arduous and complex foundation project for the No. 1 blast furnace and hot blast stove was completed in August, and preparations are now underway for the installation of the blast furnace body, which is expected to be installed within one or two months. Behind the blast furnace, more than thirty projects are under construction simultaneously at the coking and chemical plant. The first and second coke ovens have already started construction. Soon, the third and fourth coke ovens will also start construction. On the side of the coking plant is the refractory materials plant. This plant is progressing rapidly. Of its three main workshops—clay high-alumina brick, firing, and lime roasting workshops—some are excavating foundations, while others are erecting columns. The newly started sintering plant building is designed to be forty-six meters high, and its chimney is one hundred and twenty meters high, which will be the tallest building in Wuhan. In addition to these four main plant buildings, a new area of factory buildings has also appeared in the auxiliary repair facility area. These are the metal structure workshop, the mechanical repair workshop, the electrical repair workshop, the auto repair shop, the steel casting workshop, the iron casting workshop, and six or seven warehouses for various purposes. The metal structure and machine repair workshops, which were built earlier, have already installed one or two hundred pieces of machinery and equipment. The largest steel casting workshop is currently hoisting the largest columns on the construction site. Other projects such as office buildings, telephone bureaus, and staff residences are also under construction.

    Mining projects at Daye, Wulongquan, and Jiaozuo are also being fully launched in the second half of this year. Stripping projects at Tieshan and Shishan are proceeding intensively. In order to build a railway to Tieshan, workers completed a large blasting task in August and have begun laying tracks. In Wulongquan and Jiaozuo, railway, highway, water supply and drainage, residential, and other projects are under construction. (Xiao Ding)

    烧结厂动工兴建
    武钢进入施工高峰
    本报讯　武汉钢铁联合企业烧结厂9月2日开工兴建。这是武钢今年施工的五大主厂房之中的一个大厂。至此，武汉钢铁联合企业已经有二十个系统工程全面施工。
    烧结厂的任务是把贫铁矿烧结成人造富铁矿，然后再供高炉冶炼，保证铁的质量。武钢烧结厂有三个主要部分：精矿系统、配料系统和主厂房。2日开工的是配料系统受矿槽的钢筋混凝土基层工程；在此以前，精矿系统的翻车机室、主厂房的基础等七个项目，都开始了土方工程。这个工厂将在1959年第一季投入生产。
    9月，武钢的建设工程开始进入施工高峰。站在热电厂的屋顶上了望整个武钢工地，在刚挖去的山丘上，一排排厂房柱子和高大的起重机已经竖起来了，横亘厂区的公路和铁路组成了繁密的运输网，火车和汽车川流不息地运送着各种建筑材料和机器设备。这里是以四大主厂房为中心的建设工程。它的中心炼铁厂正在紧张施工，艰巨复杂的一号高炉和热风炉的基础工程已在8月浇灌完成，现在正在进行高炉本体安装准备，预计一、两个月内即可安装。在高炉的后面，炼焦化工厂有三十多个工程同时施工。第一号焦炉和第二座焦炉已经开工了。不久，第三座、第四座焦炉也要开工。在焦化厂的侧边，是耐火材料厂。这个厂的进展很快，它的三个主要车间——粘土高铝砖、火力、石灰焙烧车间——有的在挖基础，有的在竖柱子。新开工的烧结厂的厂房，按照设计有四十六公尺高，它的烟囱有一百二十公尺高，将是武汉最高的建筑物。除这四个主厂房以外，在辅助修理设施区里，也出现了一片新的厂房。这些是金属结构车间、机械修理车间、电气修配车间、汽车修理车间、铸钢车间、铸铁车间和六、七个各种用途的仓库。建设较早的金属结构和机修车间已经安装了一、两百台机器设备。最大的铸钢车间正在吊装目前工地上最大的柱子。其它像办公楼、电话局、职工住宅等工程也都在兴建中。
    大冶、乌龙泉、焦作等矿山工程也在今年下半年全面展开了。在铁山、石山剥离工程正在紧张进行。为了把铁路修上铁山，8月间，工人们完成了大爆破任务以后，已经开始铺轨。在乌龙泉和焦作，正在兴建铁路、公路、供排水、住宅等工程。	（肖定）
