Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Damascus—The Syrian government and people, united in their hatred, unanimously condemn the provocative actions of the United States. The Syrian cabinet held an emergency meeting on the 10th to discuss the provocative actions of American warships and to study the overall situation in light of Eisenhower's statement regarding Syria. After the meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told the press: "There are encouraging factors in the international environment that are beneficial to people who desire full freedom from imperialism." Bitar refuted the denial by the U.S. Navy that American warships had approached the Syrian coast, saying, "They (referring to the American warships) passed by our coast on Sunday, so close that they could be seen from the shore."

Bitar, on September 9, commenting on the recent provocative actions of the United States against Syria, said, "American psychological warfare cannot affect us, but will only make us more steadfast in our policy of liberation." He also said that Syria would not be intimidated by armed demonstrations or military deployments, because it is prepared to face any eventuality and repel any aggression.

Muhammad Mubarak, leader of the Syrian parliamentary constitutional bloc, told reporters that the United States should understand that the Arab people, and all Muslim people who stand with the Arab people, are fully determined to crush the imperialist plans and malicious conspiracies that infringe upon our independence. Parliamentarian Xiaobaji said: "We know that imperialism is attempting to use force to deprive us of the freedom we have won through bloody struggle. We will rise up against the force of imperialism and defend our motherland. Victory will surely belong to us, because all freedom-loving people stand on our side."

Mass rallies, each with about two thousand participants, were held in the Qasa and Mazrah districts of Damascus on the evening of September 10, condemning the recent provocative actions of the U.S. Sixth Fleet against Syria, and the exposed American conspiracy to subvert the current Syrian regime. Lian Dilani, Secretary-General of the Arab Writers Association, Mustafa Amin, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Syrian Peace Council, writer Michel Farah, and famous poets Abdul Karim Karmi and Muhammad Hariri spoke at the meetings. They condemned the aggression of American imperialism, and pointed out that through the unity of the military and civilians, and the support of all peace-loving countries in the world, especially the Soviet Union and People's China, the Arab people will win victory over imperialism. The congress passed a letter to the government, requesting that necessary measures be taken to defend Syria's independence and sovereignty.

    大马士革的卡萨和马兹拉赫两区9月10日晚分别举行约有两千人参加的群众大会，谴责美国第六舰队最近对叙利亚的挑衅行动，和已经被揭露的美国企图颠覆叙利亚现政权的阴谋。阿拉伯作家协会总书记利安·迪拉尼、叙利亚和平理事会全国委员会总书记穆斯塔法·阿明、作家米舍勒·法拉以及著名诗人阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡尔米和穆罕默德·哈里里在会上讲话。他们谴责美国帝国主义的侵略，并且指出，通过军民的团结和世界上所有爱好和平的国家、特别是苏联和人民中国的支持，阿拉伯人民将赢得对帝国主义的胜利。大会通过了致政府书，要求采取必要措施来保卫叙利亚的独立和主权。
