    There is Such a Poet
    Bai Hua
    There is such a poet,
    Long detached from the fiery struggle,
    Long detached from the supervision of the Party and the people,
    Long engaged in sinful, obscene disputes.
    There is such a poet,
    Constantly entering and exiting the people's court,
    But he is not a solemn plaintiff,
    But stands in the defendant's seat listening to the trial.
    There is such a poet,
    Bearing a suspended sentence,
    But he does not want to repent,
    And continues to carry out anti-Party actions.
    There is such a poet,
    A Party member placed on probation within the Party,
    He has not atoned for his sins to the Party,
    But moves closer to anti-Party elements.
    There is such a poet,
    Who feels unfortunate because he is a Party member;
    Envious of "Wu Zuguang's freedom,"
    "Freely" confronting the Party.
    There is such a poet,
    Not enthusiastic about writing poetry,
    Enthusiastically running between various anti-Party groups,
    Transmitting all kinds of anti-Party remarks.
    There is such a poet,
    Welcoming various anti-Party guests in his private residence,
    Receiving reporters from Wenhui Daily,
    Releasing whispered news.
    There is such a poet,
    Extremely cunning and vicious when opposing the Party,
    At a public gathering in full view,
    He disguises himself as pitiable and foolish.
    There is such a poet,
    Readers can no longer hear his voice;
    Because he only shouts in dead ends,
    Secretly shooting poisoned arrows at the Party and the people.
    There is such a poet,
    Who has left the Party and the revolution,
    And has also betrayed poetry,
    He is Ai Qing!
    There is such a poet,
    But the people can do without such a poet!

    有这样的诗人
    白桦
    有这样的诗人，
    长期脱离火热的斗争，
    长期脱离党与人民的监督，
    长期闹着罪恶的淫秽的纠纷。
    有这样的诗人，
    不断出入于人民法庭，
    但他不是庄严的原告，
    而是站在被告席上听审。
    有这样的诗人，
    身上背着缓期执行的徒刑，
    但他并不想悔改，
    而且继续进行反党的行径。
    有这样的诗人，
    一个留党察看的党员，
    他没有向党赎罪，
    而是向反党分子更靠近。
    有这样的诗人，
    因为自己是党员而认为不幸；
    羡慕“吴祖光式的自由”，
    “自由地”与党抗衡。
    有这样的诗人，
    对写诗并不热心，
    热心奔走于各个反党集团之间，
    传递着各式各样的反党言论。
    有这样的诗人，
    在私寓里欢迎各种反党的来宾，
    招待文汇报的记者，
    发布窃窃私语的新闻。
    有这样的诗人，
    反党时非常机智和毒狠，
    在众目睽睽的大会上，
    他装扮得可怜而又愚蠢。
    有这样的诗人，
    读者已经听不见他的声音；
    因为他只在死胡同里喊叫，
    暗地里把毒箭射向党和人民。
    有这样的诗人，
    离开了党和革命，
    也背叛了诗歌，
    他就是艾青！
    有这种诗人，
    但人民可以不要这种诗人！
