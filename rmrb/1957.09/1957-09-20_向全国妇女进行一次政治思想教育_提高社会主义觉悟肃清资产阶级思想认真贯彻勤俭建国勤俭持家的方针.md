Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The delegates to the Third National Women's Congress of China, after days of discussion, unanimously expressed that they would take building the country and managing households through diligence and thrift as a major combat task to be carried out. They proposed that in order to effectively implement this task, it is extremely necessary to launch a comprehensive political and ideological education movement among women to raise their socialist ideological consciousness.

Wu Yifang, Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province, said at the meeting that without raising women's socialist consciousness and transforming their own thinking, it would be impossible to better implement the policy of building the country and managing households through diligence and thrift. She cited examples, saying that important policies such as saving grain and saving cotton cloth are easily accepted by everyone in principle, but their specific implementation depends on women nationwide raising their socialist consciousness. She said that the relationship between individual interests and collective interests, and the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests, must be placed in the correct position, which requires women to be determined to transform themselves and eliminate selfish bourgeois ideological consciousness from their minds.

Many delegates believe that it is extremely important to strengthen political and ideological education work among women through the current socialist great debate. It was mentioned at the meeting that it has been discovered in some places that there are still many old ideas among some women, such as some female agricultural cooperative members not caring about the management of the cooperative and simply relying on the agricultural cooperative to solve all problems; among female workers, some people think that working is "suffering," and a few young female workers compare eating and dressing; some citizens are dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale system and have ideas that despise labor. Wang Ziru, Deputy Director of the Beijing Women's Federation, believes that these ideas must be overcome through long-term and arduous political and ideological work, and the current national great debate is the best educational method. Zhang Qinqiu, Vice Minister of the Textile Industry Department, especially talked about the education of young female workers. She said that due to the construction of a large number of new textile factories, tens of thousands of young girls have entered new textile factories. Unlike the older sisters, they have not experienced the pain of oppression and exploitation by imperialism and capitalists, and have not undergone the training of fierce class struggle. Therefore, they do not yet have the ideological qualities of the true working class. They are easily tempted by bourgeois ideology and are particularly likely to ruin themselves in vanity. Therefore, the education of hard work and simplicity is of more practical significance to them.

Some senior intellectual women talked about the necessity of their own transformation at the meeting. Qian Zhengying, a female water conservancy expert from an intellectual family, said in a written statement that only the Communist Party enabled her to step out of the small world of individuals and families and embark on the revolutionary path.

Liu Kairong and Huang Youkui, professors at Nanjing Normal College, both talked about the ideological transformation of senior intellectuals. They believe that the only way to transform is to participate in actual struggle and accept the leadership of the Communist Party in order to firmly establish a proletarian stand.

Today, twenty-eight delegates spoke at the meeting, and another one hundred and twenty-four delegates made written statements.

Rightist elements Ding Ling and Peng Zigang made some explanations at the meeting. Tan Tiwu and Li Jiansheng made written explanations.

　　向全国妇女进行一次政治思想教育
　　提高社会主义觉悟肃清资产阶级思想认真贯彻勤俭建国勤俭持家的方针
    据新华社19日讯　中国妇女第三次全国代表大会会议经过连日来的讨论，代表们一致表示要把勤俭建国、勤俭持家当成一个重大的战斗任务来执行。她们提出，为了切实贯彻执行这个任务，在妇女中全面展开一次政治思想教育运动，提高妇女的社会主义思想觉悟，是极为必要的。
    江苏省副省长吴贻芳在会上说，不提高妇女的社会主义觉悟，不改造自己的思想，就不可能更好地贯彻勤俭建国勤俭持家的方针。她举例说，节约粮食、节约棉布等重要政策，在道理上很容易为大家所接受，但在具体实行时，非有赖于全国妇女提高自己的社会主义觉悟不可。她说，必须把个人利益和集体利益的关系，眼前利益和长远利益的关系，完全放在正确的地位上，这样就需要妇女们有决心改造自己，肃清头脑中自私自利的资产阶级思想意识。
    很多代表认为，目前通过社会主义大辩论，加强对妇女群众的政治思想教育工作是极为重要的。会上谈到，目前有的地方已经发现在一部分妇女当中还存在着不少旧的思想，如有的女农业社员不关心社的管理，单纯依赖农业社来解决一切问题；在女职工中，有些人认为做工是“受苦”，少数青年女职工比吃比穿；有些市民对统购统销不满意，以及存在轻视劳动的思想。北京市妇联副主任王子如认为这些思想必须经过长期艰苦的政治思想工作才能克服，而目前的全国大辩论正是最好的教育方法。纺织工业部副部长张琴秋特别谈到对青年女工的教育问题。她说，由于大量新纺织工厂的建设，数以万计的年青姑娘走进了新纺织厂。她们不像老大姐们尝受过帝国主义和资本家压迫剥削的痛苦，没有经过激烈的阶级斗争的锻炼，因此，她们还没有具有真正工人阶级的思想品质，她们很容易接受资产阶级思想的诱惑，特别容易在虚荣中毁坏自己，因此艰苦朴素的教育对她们更有现实的意义。
  一些高级知识分子妇女在会上谈到了她们自身改造的必要。出身在一个知识分子家庭的女水利专家钱正英，在书面发言中说，只有共产党才使她跨出了个人和家庭的小天地，走上了革命的道路。
    南京师范学院教授刘开荣和黄友葵都谈到了高级知识分子思想改造的问题。她们认为，改造的道路只有参加实际斗争，接受共产党的领导，才能坚定地树立无产阶级立场。
    今天在大会上发言的有二十八位代表，另有一百二十四位代表作了书面发言。
    右派分子丁玲、彭子冈在会上作了一些交代。谭惕吾、李健生作了书面交代。
