Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council, made a speech on August 31st at the Ministry of Communications' Conference on Cooperation in Vehicle and Boat Transportation and Loading and Unloading Work, regarding "The Achievements of Transportation and Postal and Telecommunications Industries During the First Five-Year Plan and the Basic Guiding Principles for Future Construction."
    Wang Shoudao said: The tasks set for the transportation and postal and telecommunications industries in the Five-Year Plan can not only be completed, but many indicators will be overfulfilled. The First Five-Year Plan stipulated that the freight turnover volume of modern transportation tools nationwide in 1957 should be 150 billion ton-kilometers; it is expected that 104% of the plan can be completed, an increase of 1.27 times compared with the actual performance in 1952. Various indicators of postal and telecommunications services will also be overfulfilled. In the past five years, the construction of transportation and postal and telecommunications industries has also achieved great success. A total of more than 9,000 kilometers of railways have been newly built and repaired, accounting for 110% of the plan; more than 130,000 kilometers of new highways have been built; more than 500 new ships have been added, with a deadweight of more than 420,000 tons; the modern Zhanjiang seaport, designed and constructed by China itself, has completed the first phase of the project and has been put into use. In terms of civil aviation, a batch of transport aircraft has been added, and professional aviation has been developed, with air routes reaching more than 20,000 kilometers. In terms of postal and telecommunications construction, a national communication network with Beijing as its center has been initially formed. All counties in the country have wired or radio communications. Postal routes have reached the vast rural areas, and most districts and townships have telephones.
    When talking about the guiding principles for the construction of the transportation and postal and telecommunications industries in the future, Wang Shoudao, in addition to explaining that the transportation of state-owned modern transportation tools and folk animal-drawn carts and wooden sailboats should be considered as a whole and rationally arranged, and the construction of main lines and main streams and branch lines and tributaries should be planned as a whole and combined with each other, focused on the problem of making full use of folk transport tools. He said: The transportation of folk transport tools is of great significance for a considerable period of time. There are currently 2.92 million tons of professional wooden sailboats, more than 140,000 professional animal-drawn carts, and more than 300,000 professional rickshaws in China; there are approximately 5 million animal-drawn carts and more than 10 million various types of human-powered vehicles in rural areas. These folk transport tools can penetrate into tributaries, small rivers, and mountain paths, and are closely linked to the production and life of the vast rural people. For example, last year, animal-drawn carts alone transported 298.8 million tons of short-distance materials nationwide, which played a significant role in industrial and agricultural production and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.
    Wang Shoudao said: At present, the inconvenience of transportation in mountainous areas has become a prominent difficulty in developing the mountain economy. A large amount of diverse local specialty products and mineral materials cannot be transported out due to the inconvenience of transportation. Therefore, appropriately repairing roads in mountainous areas and appropriately developing some locally applicable transportation tools has become an urgent task for local governments and transportation departments to develop the mountain economy. The second is to gradually improve the unreasonable distribution of transportation capacity. All localities should make overall arrangements and necessary adjustments for various transportation tools according to the needs of local economic development. In areas with a large number of folk transport tools, do not blindly add more; in areas with insufficient transportation capacity or inconvenient transportation, actively improve the situation of inconvenient transportation, and increase some transportation tools as needed, or organize some transportation tools from areas with surplus transportation capacity to develop towards mountainous areas and small rivers and tributaries, in order to develop rural sideline production and adjust the seasonal and regional imbalances in transportation. It is also necessary to improve the management of folk transport tools, and make overall plans and rational arrangements for transportation work according to the characteristics of transportation tools, the source of goods, and different situations such as main lines and branch lines, long-distance and short-distance.
    Wang Shoudao finally pointed out that rational adjustment of freight rates and strengthening leadership over transportation cooperatives are also important tasks for rationally and fully utilizing folk transport tools.

    让小河小道运输畅通  使城乡物资广泛交流
    民间运输工具要充分利用起来
    王首道同志在车船运输合作化及搬运工作会议上讲话
    新华社1日讯  国务院第六办公室主任王首道8月31日在交通部车船运输合作化及搬运工作会议上作了关于“第一个五年计划期间运输和邮电业的成就及今后建设的基本方针”的讲话。
    王首道说：五年计划规定的运输和邮电业的任务不仅可以完成，而且有许多指标将超额完成。第一个五年计划规定，1957年全国现代运输工具的货运周转量指标为一千五百亿吨公里；预计可以完成计划的104％，较1952年实绩增长一点二七倍。邮电业务的各项指标也将超额完成。五年来，运输和邮电业的建设也获得了巨大成就。新建和修复的铁路共九千多公里，为计划的110％；新建公路十三万多公里；新增船舶五百多艘，载重量四十二万多吨；我国自己设计建设的现代化的湛江海港，已完成第一期工程，并已交付使用。民用航空方面，增加了一批运输机，并开展了专业航空，空中航线已达到二万多公里。邮电建设方面，以北京为中心的全国通讯网已初步形成。全国所有的县都有了有线或无线电通讯。邮路通到了广大农村，绝大部分的区和乡都通了电话。
    王首道在讲到今后运输和邮电业的建设方针时，除说明国营现代化的运输工具和民间的兽力车、木帆船的运输应统筹兼顾、合理安排，干线干流和支线支流的建设应统筹规划、互相结合外，着重说明了充分利用民间运输工具的问题。他说：民间运输工具的运输，在相当长的时期内都有着重要意义。我国现有专业木帆船二百九十二万吨，专业兽力车十四万多辆，专业人力车三十多万辆；农村兽力车约五百万辆，各种人力车约一千多万辆。这些民间运输工具能深入支流小河，山区小道，密切联系着广大农村人民的生产和生活。例如去年全国仅兽力车运送的短途物资即达二亿九千八百万吨，对工农业生产和城乡物资交流的作用很大。
    王首道说：目前，山区的交通不便已成为发展山区经济的突出困难，大量的、多种多样的土特产品和矿产物资，由于交通不便运不出来。因此，适当地修整山区的道路和适当地发展一些当地适用的运输工具，已成为地方政府和交通部门发展山区经济的迫切任务。其次是逐步改善运力分布不合理状况。各地应根据当地经济发展的需要，对各种运输工具进行统筹安排和必要的调整。在民间运输工具较多的地区，不要盲目添置；运力不足或是交通不便的地区，积极改善交通不便的状况，根据需要增加一些运输工具或从运力多余的地区组织部分运输工具向山区和小河、支流发展，以便发展农村副业生产和调节运输上季节性、地区性不平衡的状况，并且要改进民间运输工具的管理，根据运输工具的特点、货源情况、以及干线与支线、长途与短途等不同情况，统筹兼顾、合理安排运输工作。
    王首道最后指出，合理的调整运价和加强对运输合作社的领导，也都是合理和充分利用民间运输工具的重要工作。
