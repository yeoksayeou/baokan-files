Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The China Women's Third National Congress, held this afternoon, displayed the representatives' soaring fighting spirit in counterattacking the rightists. They vehemently denounced the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of rightist elements in the women's circle, such as Ding Ling, Liu Wang Liming, Tan Tiwu, Peng Zigang, Li Jiansheng, and Pu Xixiu, demanding that they honestly bow their heads to the people and admit their guilt.

The conference began at 3 p.m. The heads of the Czechoslovak Women's Delegation, Tan Tumova, the Polish Women's Delegation, S. Zawadzka, and the Korean Women's Delegation, Kim Young-soo, addressed the conference and presented valuable gifts. Ten representatives spoke at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Since the exposure of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, rightist element Liu Wang Liming in the women's circle has disappeared and made no explanation, presuming she could get away with it. However, she was exposed at the China Women's Third National Congress.

Newspapers had already revealed that Liu Wang Liming was a key member of Luo Longji's anti-Communist clique and a member of his "Ten-Person Group," and that she had very close relations with Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun. However, Liu Wang Liming has never made any explanation.

This afternoon, Wang Ze, director of the Chengdu Municipal Women's Federation, revealed in her speech at the conference Liu Wang Liming's illegal activities in organizing the "Chengdu Branch of the China Women's Temperance Society." At the end of November last year, under the guise of inspection, Liu Wang Liming illegally established the "Chengdu Branch of the Women's Temperance Society" in Chengdu without obtaining the consent of the local government or completing the filing procedures. Among the nineteen leaders of this organization, sixteen were politically complicated individuals. Among the 218 members developed, 40% were politically complicated individuals. Wang Ze said that Liu Wang Liming's purpose in organizing such people was very clear, plainly wanting to use the name of the organization to recruit soldiers and buy horses for the Zhang-Luo Alliance, and to carry out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities in reality.

Wang Ruihua, director of the China Women's Temperance Society, exposed and criticized Liu Wang Liming at the conference and in group meetings. Wang Ruihua said that Liu Wang Liming faithfully implemented the erroneous organizational line of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Her principle in using cadres was to exclude the progressive and win over the backward. She attempted to use the Women's Temperance Society as their anti-Communist and anti-socialist periphery. The branch she illegally established in Chengdu was like this. Liu Wang Liming also repeatedly said that the members of the Chengdu branch were the best, were returned students, had a high cultural level, and were the most complete team among the branches. This shows how Liu Wang Liming used this group of backward elements to make her political capital and become Luo Longji's basic henchmen for anti-communism. Over the past few years, the Women's Temperance Society has been made a mess by them under such circumstances.

Wang Ruihua said that the establishment of the Chengdu branch by Liu Wang Liming was not discussed at meetings of the council of the Women's Temperance Society's general headquarters, and very few people knew about it.

Liu Wang Liming made two speeches at two group meetings. In her speech yesterday, she was extremely arrogant. She said that some people had pulled her into the Zhang-Luo Alliance, and she felt "somewhat wronged"; however, she also said, "there are connections in ideology and organizational line," so "whether I did it intentionally or unintentionally, I must explain." She swayed back and forth at the group meeting, shamelessly boasting about her contributions, saying that she had done women's work for more than forty years, and there must have been some good things in the past. She asked everyone to help her in a genuine way according to the method of unity—criticism—unity.

Liu Wang Liming's speech aroused the anger of the representatives, and everyone exposed and criticized her. Liu Qingyang, chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation, who was familiar with her background, stood up several times to speak, debunking her lie that she had contributed to women's work for forty years. Liu Qingyang said that Liu Wang Liming has always been anti-people and is a complete bourgeois individualist. Before liberation, she had always been sitting in the embrace of American imperialism, gaining fame and reputation at home and defrauding US dollars abroad.

She said that as far as she knew, Liu Wang Liming had not participated in several great revolutionary movements in Chinese history, such as the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition, and the May Fourth Movement. She only participated in some political activities during the Anti-Japanese War because her husband was killed by the Japanese, in order to avenge her husband. Liu Qingyang said that before liberation, Liu Wang Liming did run some women and children's welfare undertakings in Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Shanghai, but these undertakings were all for her personal gain and reputation. She used these "undertakings" to lay her political capital, solicit donations, and defraud US dollars abroad. Liu Qingyang said that this is Liu Wang Liming's "achievement" in forty years of women's work.

The representatives also revealed that Liu Wang Liming had always been pro-American and anti-Soviet. She enthusiastically promoted the American way of life and slandered the Soviet Union. According to Liu Xiangqiu, a supervisor of the Women's Temperance Society, Liu Wang Liming even publicly defended American imperialist elements, shamelessly believing that "the rape of Chinese women by American soldiers is nothing remarkable."

Zhang Manjun revealed at the meeting that Liu Wang Liming's pro-American and anti-Soviet stance had a long history and a certain ideological system. Liu Wang Liming once said that she believed that there are three kinds of cultures in mankind: one is the oriental doctrine of the mean, the second is the Christian culture of Europe and the United States, and the third is Marxist-Leninist culture. Liu Wang Liming advocated "integrating" these three cultures. She also proposed establishing an "international village" and publishing newspapers to promote her reactionary ideas. Zhang Manjun said that Liu Wang Liming's reactionary ideas are exactly the same as the "world village" and world culture promoted by American imperialism, and its purpose is to eliminate Marxism-Leninism.

In today's group meeting, Liu Wang Liming's attitude was a little more restrained, not as arrogant as yesterday. However, her explanation still avoided the important and dwelt on the trivial. Like Luo Longji, she admitted that there were anti-Communist cliques before the "Three-Anti" movement, but now they are gone. However, she also said that she and rightist elements such as Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun "resonated in thought, echoed in action, and had no essential differences."

She admitted that her home had been a center for the rightists in the past, and Zhang Dongsun had planned at her home how to open up relations with the United Front Work Department and obtain so-called "tickets to heaven" in order to deceive the trust of the United Front Work Department.

Liu Wang Liming also admitted that she had been dissatisfied with the Communist Party since the Three-Anti movement, and she had attacked the All-China Women's Federation for this. She said that she recruited some released prisoners from labor camps and people whose controls had been revoked as leading cadres in Chengdu and established a branch of the Women's Temperance Society, which was "selling dog meat under the guise of selling mutton," with other intentions. However, she did not explain what her intentions were.

After Liu Wang Liming's confession, the representatives of the Zhejiang group were very dissatisfied, believing that what she said was nothing new, and that the main things had been revealed by others, and that she was playing the same tricks as Luo Longji to deny it. Lu Shijia sternly rebuked Liu Wang Liming on the spot for her attitude of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial and entangled in explaining trivial details during her confession. Lu Shijia said that Liu Wang Liming's claim that she had no connection with the Zhang-Luo Alliance was a lie. Her son, the rightist Liu Guanghua, was a fierce general under the Zhang-Luo Alliance. The branch of the Women's Temperance Society she established in Chengdu was entirely entrusted to Pan Dakui, a key member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Can it be said that there is no connection?

　　全国妇代会开辟反右派新战场
　　刘王立明同章罗联盟的狼狈关系被揭露
    新华社11日讯　在今天下午举行的中国妇女第三次全国代表大会会议上，显示了代表们反击右派的昂扬的斗志，她们痛斥了妇女界右派分子丁玲、刘王立明、谭惕吾、彭子冈、李健生、浦熙修等的反共反社会主义言行，要她们老老实实向人民低头认罪。
    大会在下午三时举行，捷克斯洛伐克妇女代表团团长坦·图莫娃、波兰妇女代表团团长斯·扎瓦德茨卡、朝鲜妇女代表团团长金英秀向大会致词，并赠送了珍贵的礼品。有十名代表在会上发了言。
    新华社11日讯　妇女界中的右派分子刘王立明自章罗联盟被揭发以来，消声匿迹，不作任何交代，满以为可以混过关去。可是，她在中国妇女第三次全国代表大会上被揭露出来。
    报纸早已揭露刘王立明是罗隆基反共小集团的骨干分子，是他的“十人团”成员之一，她同罗隆基、张东荪的关系非常密切。可是，刘王立明始终没有作出任何交代。
    今天下午，成都市妇联主任王泽在大会发言中揭露刘王立明在成都组织“中华妇女节制会成都分会”的非法活动。刘王立明在去年11月底，借视察为名，在成都非法成立“妇女节制会成都分会”，既没有取得当地政府的同意，又未办理备案手续。在这个组织里，十九个负责人中，政治上复杂的分子就有十六人。在发展的二百十八名会员中，40％是政治上复杂的分子。王泽说，刘王立明把这样一些人组织起来，其目的是很明显的，分明是想假借组织之名，为章罗联盟招兵买马，进行反共反社会主义之实。
    中华妇女节制会理事王瑞华在大会和小组会上都对刘王立明进行了揭露和批判。王瑞华说，刘王立明忠实地执行章罗联盟错误的组织路线。她的使用干部的原则，是进步的都排挤，落后的都拉拢。她企图把妇女节制会当作他们反共反社会主义的外围。她在成都非法成立的分会就是这样。刘王立明还口口声声说成都分会的成员是最好的，是留学生，文化水平高，是各分会中人马最齐的一个。这说明刘王立明是怎样利用这群落后分子来做她的政治资本，并成为罗隆基的反共基本喽啰。几年来，就在这样情况下，妇女节制会被他们搞得乌烟瘴气。
    王瑞华说，刘王立明在成都成立分会的事情，在妇女节制会总会理监事中没有开会讨论过，也很少有人知道。
    刘王立明在两次小组会上作了两次发言。在昨天发言时，她态度极为傲慢。她说，有人把她拉进了章罗联盟，她感到“有些冤枉”；不过，她又说，“在思想上、组织路线上是有联系的”，既然如此，“不管我有意或无意，我要交代。”她在小组会上摇来摆去，竟恬不知耻地丑表功，她说她做了四十多年妇女工作，过去总也有点好处。她要求大家按照团结—批评—团结的方式，真正帮她的忙。
    刘王立明的发言，引起了代表们的愤怒，大家纷纷对她进行揭露和批判。熟悉她底细的北京市妇女联谊会主席刘清扬，数次起来发言，拆穿了她四十年作妇女工作有功的谎言。刘清扬说，刘王立明一贯反人民，她是十足的资产阶级个人主义者。解放前，她一直是坐在美帝国主义的怀抱中，在国内沽名钓誉、在国外骗取美金。
　　她说，据她所知，中国历史上几个伟大的革命运动，如辛亥革命、北伐战争、五四运动等，刘王立明都没有参加过。她仅仅是因为丈夫被日本人杀死，为了报夫仇，才参加了抗日战争时期的一些政治活动。刘清扬说，解放前，刘王立明在香港、重庆、上海的确是办了一些妇女儿童福利事业，但是这些事业都是为了她个人名利双收。她利用了这些“事业”来奠定自己的政治资本，骗取捐款，在国外骗取美金。刘清扬说，这就是刘王立明四十年妇女工作的“成绩”。
    代表们还揭露刘王立明一贯地亲美反苏。她热心地宣扬美国生活方式，诋毁苏联。据妇女节制会的监事刘向秋揭露，刘王立明还公然替美帝国主义分子作辩护，她曾无耻地认为，“美军强奸中国妇女的事，是没有什么了不起的。”
    张曼筠在会上揭露刘王立明的亲美反苏由来已久，是有一定的思想体系的。刘王立明曾经说过，她认为人类有三种文化，一是东方的中庸之道，二是欧美的基督教文化，三是马列主义文化。刘王立明主张把这三种文化“融合”起来。她还曾经提议成立一个“国际村”，并且要出报纸来宣传她的反动思想。张曼筠说，刘王立明这些反动思想，恰恰与美帝国主义宣传的什么“世界村”、世界文化完全是同出一辙的，其目的就是要消灭马列主义。
    在今天的小组会上，刘王立明的态度收敛了一些，不像昨天那样狂妄了。可是，她的交代仍然避重就轻。她同罗隆基一样，承认“三反”运动以前有反共小集团的活动，可是现在没有了。不过，她又说，她同罗隆基、张东荪等右派分子，“思想上共鸣，行动上呼应，本质上是没有分歧的”。
    她承认她的家在过去曾经成为右派的中心点，张东荪曾经在她家策划如何打通统战部的关系，取得所谓“通天票”，以便骗取统战部的信任。
    刘王立明还承认，她从三反以后一直对共产党心怀不满，她曾经为此向全国妇联进行过攻击。她说，她在成都网罗一些劳改释放分子、撤销管制分子为领导骨干，成立妇女节制分会，是“挂羊头卖狗肉”，别有用意。不过她没有说明她的用意是什么。
    刘王立明交代以后，浙江小组的代表非常不满，认为她所谈的没有什么新东西，主要的事情都是别人揭露过的，而且同罗隆基玩着一样的花样进行抵赖。陆士嘉当场严厉地斥责了刘王立明在交代时避重就轻、纠缠于解释琐碎细节的态度。陆士嘉说，刘王立明狡辩她与章罗联盟没有联系，这都是谎话，她的儿子、右派分子刘光华就是章罗联盟手下的一名猛将。她在成都成立的妇女节制会分会，全部委托章罗联盟的骨干分子潘大逵领导。难道这都能说成是没有联系吗？
