Xinhua News Agency report.
In the past, ethnic minorities in Yunnan generally lacked printing technology. Folk books were mostly handwritten, while some used iron pens to engrave on palm leaves and bamboo slips. Copying was difficult, slow, and of poor quality. It was not easy for the general readership to obtain the books they loved. In order to help ethnic minorities develop their own publishing endeavors, the Party and the People's Government have in recent years absorbed a large number of ethnic minority intellectuals to participate in translation and compilation work. Printing plants for languages such as Dai, Jingpo, and Lisu have been established in Kunming, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and other places. Since 1953, Yunnan People's Publishing House has successively published more than 20 kinds of books and periodicals in various ethnic minority languages, totaling more than 181,000 copies, elucidating the Party's policies and reflecting the lives and struggles of ethnic minorities in the border areas. The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture published their own ethnic newspapers for the first time in history. Among them, the "Unity Daily" in Dehong Autonomous Prefecture, founded in 1955, is published in four languages: Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, and Han. Education departments in various places have also distributed a large number of literacy textbooks, elementary school textbooks, and other teaching materials compiled in ethnic minority languages. At present, the compiled Jingpo vocabulary, Chinese-Dai comparison dictionary, Chinese-Jingpo comparison dictionary, and several ethnic grammar outlines are also about to be printed and distributed.

    云南少数民族出版事业发展很快
    从手抄本到建立民族文学的印刷厂
    云南少数民族从前一般都没有印刷技术，民间的书籍多用手抄本，有的则用铁笔刻写在贝叶和竹简上。抄写工作艰难缓慢，质量低劣。广大读者都不容易得到自己喜爱的书籍。党和人民政府为了帮助少数民族发展本民族的出版事业，几年来各有关部门吸收了大批少数民族知识分子，参加翻译和编纂工作。在昆明、西双版纳傣族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州等地都先后建立了傣、景颇、傈僳等民族文字的印刷厂。自1953年迄今，云南人民出版社已经陆续用各种少数民族文字出版了阐述党的政策及反映边疆少数民族生活和斗争的书刊共计二十多种十八万一千多册。西双版纳傣族自治州和德宏傣族景颇族自治州历史上第一次出版了本民族的报纸，其中1955年创刊的德宏自治州的“团结报”是以傣、景颇、傈僳、汉四种民族文字发行的。各地教育部门还大量发放了以少数民族文字编纂的扫盲课本、小学课本等教科书。目前，已纂编好的景颇文词汇，汉、傣对照词典，汉、景颇文对照词典和几种民族的语法纲要等也即将印发。（据新华社讯）
