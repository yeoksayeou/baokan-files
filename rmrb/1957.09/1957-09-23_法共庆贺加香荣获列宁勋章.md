    法共庆贺加香荣获列宁勋章
    据新华社巴黎21日电　法国共产党议会党团和“人道报”社分别在20日上午和下午举行集会，庆祝马尔赛·加香八十八岁寿辰和荣获列宁勋章。法共中央政治局委员艾蒂安·法戎在议会党团集会上的祝辞中强调指出，加香对于人们向他表示的崇高敬意是当之无愧的。加香在欢呼声中接受了献礼和花束。
    “人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯以“光荣归于加香”为题在21日的“人道报”上写道：直到我们庆祝加香八十八寿辰的今天，加香还一刻不停地进行着争取法苏友好和保卫和平的斗争。这种斗争使他对于苏联授给他列宁勋章当之无愧。
    “人道报”20日登载了法国共产党政治局对加香寿辰和荣获列宁勋章的贺词。
    贺词说：“马尔赛·加香认为苏联是社会主义不可动摇的支柱，是为全人类铺设了通向未来的光明大道的国家。他和法国全体自觉的爱国者都一直认为苏联是法国的当然盟友，并且一直没有停止为扩大我国和这个伟大的国家之间的牢固的友谊而进行的斗争，这个友谊是我国的独立与和平的最可靠的保证”。
