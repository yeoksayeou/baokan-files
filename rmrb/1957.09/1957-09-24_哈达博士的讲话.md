Mr. Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Ladies and Gentlemen, Esteemed Guests:

    First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my very enthusiastic hosts who invited me to visit China.

    As I said at the airport yesterday: When I set foot on Chinese soil, I did not feel like a stranger at all, but rather that I was in a friendly country.

    Today I visited many places, saw many famous cultural relics inherited from ancient China, and many new buildings that will become the foundation of future Chinese art.

    Everywhere I saw a friendly atmosphere, an atmosphere that helps to enhance the friendly relations between Indonesia and China.

    Just now, Prime Minister Zhou Enlai mentioned two major events in the past two years, which will become the basis for consolidating friendship and cooperation among all nations in the world.

    First, the Prime Minister mentioned the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Prime Minister Zhou Enlai is one of the creators of these five principles. Secondly, he mentioned the Ten Principles adopted at the Bandung Conference. With these two principles, namely the Five Principles and the Ten Principles signed by many countries at the Bandung Conference, I firmly believe that they will become the basis for building a friendly new world.

    Indeed, we all know that it is not easy to achieve lasting peace and friendship between nations, or rather, to achieve this kind of friendship in this world full of psychological contradictions. But no matter how difficult it is, since the Bandung Conference has set an example for us, we can promote lasting peace and friendship among all nations in the world.

    We face many difficulties, but due to the development of various technologies, the world is shrinking more and more, and whether we like it or not, we must eventually unite and cooperate.

    It is no exaggeration to say that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia are advocates of worldwide friendship.

    Therefore, I am very happy that I can come to visit China this time, to observe and learn at close range, and to respect the ideals of peace that have emerged in this country.

    I would be very happy if my visit could contribute to further strengthening the friendly relations between our two countries.

    Finally, I ask everyone to raise their glasses

    To the health of Prime Minister Zhou Enlai and his wife,
    To the happiness of the Chinese people,
    To the friendship between Indonesia and China,
    To the realization of the common ideal, namely the friendship of all nations,
    To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong,
    Cheers!

### 哈达博士的讲话

专栏：

    哈达博士的讲话周恩来总理阁下，先生们、女士们，各位来宾：
    首先我向邀请我前来中国访问的非常热情的主人表示深深的感谢。
    正如昨天我在飞机场上所说的：我踏上中国的土地时，我完全没有感觉到自己是陌生人，而我所感到的是置身于一个友好的国家。
    今天我参观了许多地方，看了许多中国古代遗留下来的著名文物，以及许多将成为未来的中国艺术基础的新建筑。
    在各个地方我看到了友好的气氛，看到了有助于增进印度尼西亚和中国友好关系的气氛。
    刚才周恩来总理提到了近两年来的两个重大事件，这两个重大事件将成为巩固全世界各个民族友好和合作的基础。
    首先总理提到了和平共处的五项原则。周恩来总理是这个五项原则的缔造者之一。其次，他提到在万隆会议所通过的十项原则。有了这两个原则即五项原则和在万隆会议由许多国家签署的十项原则，我深信它将成为建设友好的新世界的基础。
    诚然我们大家都知道，要实现持久和平和各民族之间的友好，或者更确切地说要在这充满心理矛盾的世界来实现这种友好是不容易的。但是，不管怎样困难，由于万隆会议各国已经给我们做出了榜样，我们就能促使全世界实现持久和平和各民族间的友好。
    我们所面临的困难是不少的，但是，由于各种技术的发展，世界越来越缩小，不管我们愿意或不愿意，我们终究必须团结，必须合作。
    如果我这样说，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国是全世界友好的倡导者，这是不过份的。
    因此我非常高兴我这次能前来访问中国，就近观察和学习，并尊重这个国家所产生的争取和平的理想。
    如果我这次的访问能对进一步加强我们两国之间的友好关系作出贡献，我将感到十分高兴。
    最后，我请大家举杯
    为周恩来总理和他的夫人的健康，
    为中国人民的幸福，
    为印度尼西亚和中国的友好，
    为共同理想即各民族的友好的实现，
    为毛泽东主席阁下的健康，
    而干杯！
