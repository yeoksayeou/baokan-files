    What I Know About American Democracy, Freedom, and Equality
    Hou Debang
    From 1913 to 1948, I went to the United States seven times over a period of 35 years. I stayed in the U.S. for more than 20 years. My initial purpose was to study, and later it was to design factories and purchase machinery for the Yongli Chemical Company. Although my contact with American society was not extensive, I am willing to share my observations, experiences, and personal encounters with comrades as a reference for the anti-rightist struggle.
          Such a “Democratic” System
    The United States emulates the Swiss system by adopting a federal system with a so-called "separation of powers" between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The U.S. Congress is bicameral, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state has two senators, and representatives are elected based on the population of each state, all directly elected by citizens. There are mainly only two political parties in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Others, such as the Socialist Party and the Progressive Party, have very few members and are insignificant. The Communist Party is not recognized. The U.S. President and Vice President are elected from candidates nominated by the Democratic and Republican parties. The election method involves voters in each state electing a number of electors equal to the number of that state's representatives, who then select two individuals from the presidential and vice-presidential candidates of the two parties to serve as President and Vice President. This electoral system is extremely undemocratic, as candidates are always manipulated by capitalists.
    Firstly, there are significant restrictions on electoral qualifications. In addition to the age requirement of being over 21, there are also property and residency requirements. The property requirement restricts the working people (proletariat) who do not own property, denying them the right to vote. The residency requirement stipulates that one must vote where they were born and raised. If one wants to participate in another district, the law requires residing in that district for a certain period before being eligible to vote. This also limits some people from voting. Nominally, there is gender equality, but very few women actually vote. They have a saying: "Women can be represented by their husbands." Nominally, there is equality among all ethnic groups, but in reality, Black people are not only economically restricted but also politically discriminated against, subjected to terrorist means of persecution, making them afraid to vote. In some southern states, Black people cannot afford to pay the poll tax and are also unable to vote. Big capitalists also hint to their employees that they must vote for their candidates, or use their financial resources, status, and power to make people vote for them, manipulating elections to ensure that candidates who serve their interests are elected as representatives, governors, presidents, and vice presidents. Big capitalists spend a lot of money in election campaigns, calling it "private donations." After the president or governor is elected, they sell official positions to reward the capitalists and landlords who supported their election. Representatives bribed by capitalists naturally try to pass bills that benefit capitalists and landlords. Is this considered democracy?
    The U.S. financial bills are proposed by the House of Representatives. The Senate has no power to propose them, but it can amend or reject them. If the Senate disagrees, the bill cannot pass Congress. Therefore, capitalists can obstruct legislation by buying off a few senators. After passing both houses, it must also be signed by the president. If the president vetoes it, the bill cannot become law unless both houses pass it again with a two-thirds majority. This is practically impossible. Therefore, the president's veto power often becomes an effective weapon to prevent a bill from becoming law.
    This legislative procedure is very undemocratic because only bills that benefit a certain group and are agreed to by the president have a chance of becoming law. As for bills that benefit the working people or farmers, they are unlikely to be passed. The Speaker of the House can manipulate Congress, enabling some bills to pass and others to be rejected, as he has great power to control the House. Without his permission, representatives cannot speak. This makes it clear how democratic the U.S. Congress is!
    The U.S. President directly handles state affairs, without a premier. His assistants are the Secretary of State, responsible for state and foreign affairs. The Secretary of State and the heads of various departments are nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. They are all capitalists or their agents, mostly people who have connections with the president or who have contributed to the president's election.
    Both the Republican and Democratic parties are parties of big capitalists, representing the interests of capitalists. Therefore, bills that benefit the interests of capitalists are not obstructed in Congress. Bills that benefit the working people and world peace are difficult to pass, and even if they are reluctantly passed, they are subjected to all sorts of misinterpretations and emasculation, existing only in name.
    The U.S. judiciary is ostensibly independent. It can declare certain measures by the president or Congress illegal and invalid. The Chief Justice and judges of the Supreme Court, totaling nine, are nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. The president has the power to retire some old judges and replace them with people who suit his taste. President Roosevelt did this during his term. Thus, the judiciary cannot be completely independent either.
    The U.S. government is anti-democratic. After World War II, the reactionary face of the United States intensified. The Communist Party was persecuted everywhere. Every government employee had to guarantee that they were not a Communist Party member and that they had no so-called "un-American activities." Every civil servant had to sign a "loyalty oath." Failure to do so would be seen as a "dangerous element" with "un-American activities" and would be dismissed or not hired. Communist Party members had to register, otherwise it was against the law. After registration, they were monitored.
    The U.S. Constitution stipulates freedom of assembly. But in reality, when the Communist Party holds meetings, the government sends police to monitor them and dispatches agents to disrupt the meetings. After disrupting the meetings, the police can use this as an excuse to interfere and order the meetings to be stopped.
    Progressives are often labeled as Communist Party members or accused of "un-American activities" or "subversive activities," and their jobs are not guaranteed. They are persecuted everywhere, even to the point where the Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on trumped-up charges. Black singer Paul Robeson was not allowed to go abroad to perform. Atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer was ostracized. Progressive history professor Charles Beard at Columbia University was fired from the school. These are all examples.
      The Capitalists’ “Free World”
    American industry is very developed. But American industry is controlled by a few monopoly capitalists. Today, there are nine major families or nine major groups. These monopoly capitalists are the result of so-called "free competition" in capitalist society. Oil tycoon Rockefeller swallowed up many small oil companies and became a large oil trust monopolizing the oil industry as early as 1870. The Morgan syndicate is the same. Others, such as Ford Motor Company, General Motors, General Electric (GE), DuPont, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation, Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, etc., are all like this, each dominating a certain industry nationwide, or several sharing a certain industry nationwide. They are also colluding with each other, such as GE, DuPont, and General Motors, which are colluding together. Not only that, they are also colluding with large foreign trusts. For example, DuPont of the United States, IG Farben of Germany, Imperial Chemical Industries of the United Kingdom, Saint-Gobain of France, and Montecatini of Italy all communicate with each other. American industry has transformed from a situation where big fish eat small fish into a few extremely large groups, and has further colluded with foreign trusts to plunder colonies and weak countries. The U.S. Congress once passed an "anti-trust bill" to prohibit big companies from swallowing up smaller ones, but in reality, it has long been misinterpreted and is equivalent to a mere formality.
    American capitalists have complete freedom to dismiss workers. When business is sluggish, capitalists reduce production and lay off workers. Either a portion of workers are laid off completely, or working hours are universally shortened. Therefore, either a portion of workers are completely unemployed, or a large portion of workers are in a state of semi-employment. The U.S. Congress has no laws to prevent capitalists from arbitrarily dismissing workers. Capitalists do not need to provide any explanation; it is enough to say "there is no work in the factory." What happens to workers after they are unemployed is none of their business.
    There is inequality between male and female workers in the United States. Female workers' wages are generally lower than those of male workers, and unequal pay for equal work is a common phenomenon. Moreover, it is not easy for female workers to find jobs. Once an economic crisis occurs, female workers are the first to be eliminated. Female workers do not have maternity leave. There is no pay for taking leave. After childbirth, job security cannot be guaranteed. And the discrimination that Black people face in employment is even worse.
    As for technical personnel, they serve the capitalists completely. American capitalists are willing to spend more on research expenses to attempt to obtain more profits. However, the research results of technical personnel in the laboratory are entirely owned by the capitalists who employ them. Capitalists obtain patent rights for their inventions. For example, chemist Wallace Carothers, who invented nylon, was a researcher in the DuPont laboratory. During World War II, he researched nylon. Initially, he could report on the progress of his research in magazines, but as the experiments progressed, there were fewer and fewer reports, and finally, the capitalists did not allow him to publish anything. When his experiments were completely successful, there was no further news. Soon, he died of depression, never receiving even a tiny benefit from his invention of nylon, while nylon became a highly profitable new enterprise for DuPont.
    For the benefit of their own businesses, capitalists often shelve the results of some new technologies, preventing them from serving society. For example, Edison's invention of the electric light originally used carbon filaments. Carbon filament light bulbs emitted a reddish light that was not bright and consumed a lot of electricity. Tungsten filament light bulbs were brighter, but after GE obtained the patent rights for tungsten filament light bulbs, it took a long time before they produced the product. The reason was that they still had a large batch of carbon filament light bulbs that they had not yet sold. Vanadium catalyst was made by a German named Jaeger in the Monsanto Chemical Company's laboratory. Later, Jaeger went to work for American Cyanamid Company and told the capitalists about the vanadium catalyst method. This company also applied for patent rights. Afterwards, the two companies fought over the production of vanadium catalysts, and the lawsuit lasted for a long time. The result was that the two companies were granted joint patent rights, and Jaeger did not receive any benefits. This shows that although capitalists have contradictions and lawsuits, inventors cannot escape their control and do not receive benefits.
    Today, atomic energy is a new source of power. It is a major revolution in power. During World War II, many European scientists came to the United States to research the atomic bomb for the United States. Although the United States was the first country to complete the atomic bomb, it insisted on focusing solely on weapons and did not dedicate itself to the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union already has atomic power plants and atomic icebreakers, and even the United Kingdom has an atomic power plant, but the United States still does not have an atomic power plant. Isn't this strange? In reality, the large capitalists of U.S. utility companies (such as Edison Electric Institute) control public thermal power plants. They believe that building atomic power plants would hinder their monopolistic profits. Therefore, the U.S. "free" system allows capitalists to use atomic energy as a weapon of murder, rather than using atomic energy for peaceful purposes to benefit the people.
    A French atomic energy scientist did not want to participate in the U.S. research on the atomic bomb. Afterwards, the U.S. government did not want him and even did not allow him to come to the United States. This person was Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Later, he was invited to the United States for a matter, and after he got off the plane, the U.S. government refused him entry. Atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer was the general person in charge of the atomic bomb factory, and had made great contributions to the U.S. government. After the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, scientists with conscience were unwilling to engage in the research and manufacture of atomic weapons, but Truman wanted them to continue researching the hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer was one of those who did not want to participate in the research on the hydrogen bomb. The U.S. government ostracized him. What freedom do scientists have in the United States? The Rosenbergs were falsely accused, and countless righteous people around the world supported their rescue, but they were eventually illegally executed. If American scientists encounter such things, what "democracy" and "freedom" are there to talk about? Do our senior intellectuals and scientists still have any illusions about this? Therefore, the so-called "free world" of the United States is the world of capitalists.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we can conduct criticism and self-criticism. Even more valuable is criticism from the bottom up. In the United States, if someone naively wants to criticize a capitalist's bad behavior in the newspaper, he will accuse you of defamation and demand compensation for damages. It is very expensive to file a lawsuit in the United States. Rich people can hire defense lawyers, while ordinary people often go bankrupt due to losing lawsuits. Where is there any democracy, freedom, or equality to speak of?
        A Few Personal Experiences
    Racial discrimination is very serious in American society. They discriminate against Black people, Native Americans, Jews, and also against Orientals. In 1913, I was sent to study in the United States by Tsinghua University. At that time, many American barbershops did not cut hair for Chinese people. Later, after entering MIT, I needed to rent a house outside the school because there were no dormitories. Some houses clearly had "For Rent" signs, but the landlords either said "the house has already been rented out" or simply said, "We don't welcome you Orientals." Once we rented a house, but the landlord had a condition that we had to enter and exit from the back door because she did not want people on the street to see that Chinese people were living in her place. We became her inglorious tenants.
    In 1916, more than 20 of my MIT classmates and I, led by our teacher, went to visit a factory. There was an American calcium cyanamide plant located on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. As we walked across the International Railway Bridge, when we reached the Canadian side, Canadian police detained two of us Chinese students. Even though the teacher leading the group said that we were MIT students visiting and guaranteed that the whole class would return in two or three hours, it was still not allowed. The two of us had to turn back. This International Railway Bridge was only a few tens of meters long, and both ends could be seen, but when we returned to the American side, the American police at the bridgehead also stopped us from entering. I explained to them in every possible way to no avail. Therefore, we could not walk on either end of the bridge and had to stand on the bridge for three hours, waiting for the teacher to lead the American students back, vouch for us, and then we were released. This kind of unwarranted difficulty was simply because we were yellow. In fact, people from the U.S. and Canada do not need any identification to enter and exit the International Railway Bridge.
    In the same year, I went with my classmates to visit the Taylor Instrument Company in Buffalo. The person in charge of the company insulted us face to face, saying, "You Chinese students cannot come in to visit." We had no choice but to endure the humiliation and turn back. Even now, when I see imported blood pressure measuring instruments in a certain hospital in Beijing, marked with the Tycos brand, which is produced by this factory, I still feel resentment.
    On another occasion, I traveled from New York to Illinois to inspect two generators purchased by the Yongli Alkali Plant. I took a New York Central Railroad train, buying a through sleeper ticket. After the train passed Niagara Falls and entered the Michigan Central Railroad, it had to pass through a section of Canadian territory. It was the middle of the night, and I was fast asleep when Canadian police dragged me out of the sleeper car and detained me overnight because I was Chinese and did not have a passport to enter Canada. Even though I argued with him, using the through ticket as proof, explaining that I was going from New York to Illinois and did not know that I had to pass through a section of Canadian railway, and saying that the train conductor could watch me get off at a certain station, it was still not allowed. So, I was detained in a detention center overnight. The next morning, the policeman made a phone call, I don't know what he said, and then escorted me back to the American border. I was unjustly detained overnight, not knowing what crime I had committed. I missed work and wasted the train ticket. This is the democracy, freedom, and equality touted by capitalist countries.
    In the past, there are countless examples of Chinese students and overseas Chinese being discriminated against abroad. I once wrote an article in a Chinese newspaper saying, "Studying abroad should be with the aim of not studying abroad," meaning that because the reactionary government at that time humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty, it could not protect the legitimate status and rights and interests of Chinese students and overseas Chinese. Therefore, I advised us students that after completing our studies and returning to China, we should work hard for the construction of our motherland, strive for self-reliance, so as to avoid sending students to the United States to suffer this kind of treatment again.
    The above is what I have seen and heard, and my personal experiences. I don't think that the American way of life is something to be admired. Most other people who have been to the United States have also tasted the bitterness of being discriminated against and insulted like me. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party have the Chinese people stood up. I really don't know why some people still have pro-American sentiments and are nostalgic for American life? Unless they have lost their conscience, cannot distinguish right from wrong, and recognize the thief as their father, only then would they have such thoughts. Rightist elements, open your eyes and look at the achievements of the new China in the past eight years! Compare it with the so-called "democracy, freedom, and equality" of the United States! You should wake up. We love our motherland, love our Party, and love our socialist system. Rightist elements, hurry up and turn back!

    我所知道的美国的民主自由和平等
    侯德榜
    从1913到1948年的三十五年之间，我曾七次去美国。在美国有二十多年之久。我最初去的目的是读书，以后去的是为永利化学公司设计工厂与采购机件。在美接触面虽不广，但愿以所见所闻和亲身经历介绍给同志们作为反右派斗争的参考。
          如此“民主”制度
    美国是仿瑞士制采取联邦制度的，实行所谓行政、立法、司法“三权分立”的制度。美国国会是两院制，由参议院和众议院两院组成。参议员每州两名，众议员按各州人口比例选出，都是直接由公民选举。美国政党主要只有两个，就是民主党与共和党。其余如社会党、进步党等等，成员极少，无足轻重。共产党是不被承认的。美国总统、副总统是由民主党与共和党各提出候选人来竞选。选举方法是由各州选民选出同该州议员相同的人数为选举员，再由这些选举员由这两党的总统和副总统候选人中选出二人为总统、副总统。这种选举制度是极不民主的，候选人一直为资本家们所操纵。
    首先在选举资格上就有很大限制。除选民年龄须在二十一岁以上外，还有财产限制与居留限制。财产限制，是使无财产的劳动人民（无产阶级）受到限制，没有选举权。居留限制是生长在何处，应在何处投票。若要参加另一区，法律规定至少须在这区居留若干时期才可参加选举。这样也限制了一部分人不能投票。名义上是男女平权，实际上很少妇女去投票。他们有句话说：“女人可由其丈夫做代表”。名义上是各民族平等，实际上黑人除了经济上已受限制外，还在政治上受到歧视，遭到恐怖手段的迫害，使他们不敢去投票。在南部某些州，黑人因纳不起人头税，也不能参加投票。大资本家还暗示职工必须投他的票，或用其财力、地位、权势使人投他的票，操纵选举，使合乎他利益的候选人来当议员、州长、总统、副总统。大资本家在选举运动中花很多的钱，名为“私人捐助”。总统或州长当选后，就卖官鬻爵来酬劳支持他选举的资本家和地主们。被资本家贿选出来的议员们，当然设法通过有利于资本家、地主们的法案。这算是民主吗？
    美国财政法案是由众议院提出的。参议院无权提出，但能加以修改或不予通过。如参议院不同意，法案就不能通过国会。因此，资本家收买了少数参议员，即能起阻挠作用。两院通过后，还须经总统签字。如总统否决，法案也不能成立，除非两院各以三分之二的多数票，再度通过。这实际上是很难的。所以总统的否决权，往往成为使某一法案不能成立的一个有效武器。
    这种立法手续是很不民主的，因为只有有利于某一集团的法案，得到总统同意，才有成立希望。至于有利于劳动人民或农民的法案，就不会被通过。众议院的议长可以操纵国会，使某法案通过，某法案不予通过，因为他有极大的权力，操纵众议院。没有他的允许，议员不能起来讲话。这就可以明了美国国会是如何民主呢！
    美国总统直接处理国家大事，没有总理，他的助手是负责国务与外交的国务卿。国务卿及各部部长是由总统提名由参议院通过的。他们都是资本家或其代理人，大半都是对总统有关系或对总统当选有功的人。
    共和党与民主党都是大资本家的政党，代表了资本家的利益，因此有利于资本家利益的法案，在国会是不会被阻挠的。而有利于劳动人民与世界和平的法案，很难通过，即使勉强通过，也遭受到种种的曲解与阉割，有名无实。
    美国的司法表面上是独立的。它可以宣布总统或国会的某些措施非法无效。最高法院的院长与法官共九人，是总统提名由参议院通过的。总统有权使某些老的法官退休，而另换符合他的口味的人。罗斯福总统在任时，就这样做过。如此，司法也不能是完全独立的。
    美国政府是反民主的。第二次世界大战结束后，美国的反动面貌，变本加厉。共产党到处受迫害。每个政府工作人员必须保证不是共产党员，并保证没有所谓“非美活动”。每个公务人员必须具结“忠诚保证”。如不具结，即被视为有“非美活动”的“危险分子”，即被开除，或不被录用。共产党员要登记，否则就是违法。登记后即受到监视。
    美国宪法规定集会自由。但实际上共产党开会时，政府派警察监视，并派遣特务在会场中捣乱。捣乱会场后，警察即可以此为借口进行干涉，勒令停止开会。
    进步人士常被目为共产党员，或被加上犯了“非美活动”或“颠覆活动”的罪名，这样他的职业就得不到保障，到处受迫害，甚至像卢森堡夫妇竟被以莫须有的罪名判处死刑。黑人歌唱家罗伯逊不得出国演唱。原子能科学家奥本海谟受到排挤。哥伦比亚大学进步的历史教授比尔德先生被开除出校。这都是例子。
      资本家们的“自由世界”
    美国的工业是很发达的。但是美国的工业都操纵在少数垄断资本家之手。现在就有九大家族，或九大集团。这些垄断资本家就是资本主义社会中所讲的“自由竞争”的结果。石油大王洛克菲勒就吞并了许多小的石油企业，从1870年就成为垄断石油的大托辣斯。摩根银团也是如此。其他如福特汽车公司。通用汽车公司，通用电气公司（奇异公司），杜邦公司，联合化学染料公司，联合碳与碳化物公司等等，无一不是如此，各自独霸了全国某一种行业，或几家瓜分全国某一种行业。他们之间又勾结在一起，如奇异公司，杜邦公司，通用汽车公司，就勾结在一起。不但如此，他们与外国的大托辣斯也勾结在一起。如美国的杜邦公司和德国的依格·法本化学公司、英国的卜内门公司、法国的圣·哥邦、意大利的蒙特卡提尼都是互相通气的。美国工业已由大鱼吃小鱼的方式成为少数极庞大的集团，并进而与国外托拉斯勾结，掠夺殖民地及弱小国家。美国国会也曾通过一条禁止大吃小的“反托辣斯法案”，但实际上早已被曲解等于具文了。
    美国资本家有解雇工人的完全自由。资本家在营业不景气时，就缩减产量，裁减工人。不是裁去一部分工人，就是普遍地缩短工时。所以不是一部分工人完全失业，就是一大部分工人处于半失业状态。美国国会没有任何法律制止资本家任意解雇工人。资本家不需要作任何解释，只须说“厂内没有工作做了”，就够了。工人失业后如何，那不关他们的事。
    美国男女工人是不平等的。女工工资一般都少于男工，同工不同酬是普遍现象。且女工不易找到工作。一旦遇到经济恐慌，女工首先被淘汰。女工没有产假。请假没有工资。产后回来，工作岗位也不能得到保障。而黑人在就业方面遭到的歧视，更不在话下。
    至于技术人员完全是为资本家服务的。美国资本家为了企图得到更多的利润，不惜多花一些研究费用。但技术人员在研究室内的研究成果，完全为雇用的资本家所有。资本家获得其发明的专利权。例如发明玻璃丝“尼龙”的化学家卡罗色尔斯是杜邦公司试验室的研究员。他在第二次世界大战时期研究出“尼龙”，最初尚可在杂志上报道其研究工作情况，但试验越进展，报道越少，最后资本家就不许他发表了。当他实验全部成功时就更无下文了。不久他竟忧郁而死，终身没有得到一丝一毫发明“尼龙”的好处，而“尼龙”却成了杜邦公司一项利市百倍的新企业。
    资本家为了自己企业的利益，往往使一些新工艺、新技术的成果搁起，不能为社会服务。例如爱迪生发明的电灯，原是用炭精丝的。炭精丝灯泡光色红而不亮，而且耗电，不如钨丝灯泡亮，但奇异公司取得钨丝灯泡专利权后，过了许多时候才制出商品。原因是它尚有一大批炭精丝灯泡尚未抛售出去。钒触媒是德国人贾格在孟山都化学公司研究室制成的。后来贾格到美国氰氨化物公司工作，又将钒触媒法告诉资本家。这公司也申请专利权。以后两家争做钒触媒，官司打了很久。结果判两公司共享专利权，而贾格没有得到什么好处。这说明资本家们尽管有矛盾打官司，而发明人始终跳不出他们的魔掌，得不到好处。
    今天原子能是动力的新来源。在动力上是个大革命。第二次世界大战时，很多欧洲科学家到美国，替美国研究出原子弹。美国虽是最先完成原子弹的国家，但它执意专搞武器，并不致力于原子能的和平利用。苏联今天已有原子能发电站和原子能破冰船，甚至英国也有了一个原子能发电站，唯独美国至今还没有原子能发电站，岂非奇事。其实是美国公用公司大资本家（如爱迪生动力公司）控制了公用火力发电站。他们认为建造原子能发电站，会妨碍其独占利润。所以美国的“自由”制度使资本家得以用原子能为杀人武器，而不用原子能于和平事业，为人民谋福利。
    有一个法国原子能科学家，不愿参加美国研究原子弹的工作。以后美国政府就不要他，甚至不允许他来美国。这人就是约里奥—居里。后来他有事应邀到美国，下飞机后美国政府又拒绝他入境。原子能科学家奥本海谟是制造原子弹工厂的总负责人，对美国政府说来，是有过极大贡献的。投在日本的原子弹爆炸后，使有良心的科学家不愿再从事研究制造原子武器了，而杜鲁门却要他们继续研究氢弹。奥本海谟即是不愿参加研究氢弹的一个。美国政府就对他加以排斥。科学家在美国有什么自由？卢森堡夫妇被诬告，世界多少正直人士声援营救，但他们终于被非法处死。美国科学家遭遇如此，还有什么“民主”“自由”可说呢？我们高级知识分子和科学家们难道对于这还有什么幻想吗？因此，美国所谓的“自由世界”，就是资本家的世界。
    我们在共产党领导下，可以进行批评与自我批评。更可贵的是自下而上的批评。在美国，假如有人天真地想对某一个资本家的恶劣行为在报上提出批评，他会以破坏名誉的罪名控告你，要你赔偿损失。在美国打官司是很花钱的，有钱人可以请辩护律师，而一般人往往因诉讼失败而致破产。哪里还有民主、自由、平等之可言？
        几件个人亲身经历
    美国社会上种族歧视是很严重的。他们歧视黑人、印第安人、犹太人，也歧视东方人。我于1913年，由清华大学派往美国留学，当时许多美国理发铺，不为中国人剪发。后来进了麻省理工学院后，因无宿舍须在校外租房居住。有些房子明明挂着“招租”牌子，但是房主不是说“房子已经租出”，就干脆说：“我们不欢迎你们东方人”。有一次我们租到房子，但房东有个条件，要我们从后门出入，因为不愿意让大街上的人看到有中国人住在她处。我们做了她的不光荣的房客。
    1916年我与麻省理工学院同班毕业同学二十余人，由教员率领往工厂参观。有个美国石灰氮厂，在奈亚格拉瀑布对面的加拿大的境内。我们走过万国铁穹桥，行到加拿大一端时，被加拿大警察将我们二个中国学生扣留。虽经领队教员说是麻省理工学院学生去参观的，担保全班二三小时即回，仍未得许可。我们二人只好折回。这铁穹桥不过数十公尺长，两端均可望见，而我们回到美境这一端时，桥头美国警察竟也拦阻我们入境。我向他们百般解释无效。因此在桥上两端都走不得，只好在桥上站了三小时，等教员率领美国学生回来后，代我们保证，然后才放行。这种无端为难，就是因为我们是黄种人。其实美加两国人民出入万国铁穹桥，并不要任何证明的。
    同年，我随同班毕业同学到陌法罗市戴乐尔仪器公司参观。该公司负责人当面污辱我们说：“你们中国学生不能进去参观。”我们只得忍辱折回。至今我看到北京某医院中有进口的量血压仪器，上刻有Tycos照牌，就是这厂出品。我看着还引起我的愤恨。
    又有一次我从纽约到伊利诺州去验收永利沽厂所购的二台发电机。我乘纽约中央铁路火车，买的是通车卧铺票。该铁路出奈亚格拉瀑布后入密歇根中央铁路要经过加拿大境一段，时正半夜，我已熟睡，加拿大警察把我由卧铺拖下车去，拘留了一夜，因为我是中国人，没有入加拿大的护照。我虽与他申辩，以通车票为证，说明我是由纽约要去伊利诺州，不知道要经过加拿大一段铁路，说明可由列车员看我在某站下车，但是仍然不允。我就被拘在拘留所一晚。次晨，这个警察打了一次电话，不知如何说的，就把我押送还美境。我无辜被拘一夜，不知犯了何罪。误了工作，白花车票。这就是资本主义国家标榜的民主、自由与平等。
    过去中国留学生和华侨在国外受歧视的例子是说不完的。我曾在中国某报上写一篇文章，说“留学应是以不留学为目的”，就是说因为那时反动政府丧权辱国，不能保障留学生和华侨的合法地位和权益，因而劝我们留学生，学成回国后，要努力为祖国建设，发愤自强，以免再派留学生来美国受这种罪了。
    以上是我个人的所见所闻，亲身经历。美国方式的生活，我认为是不足以羡慕的。其他到过美国的人大都也像我一样，都尝过被人歧视和侮辱的滋味。只有在共产党领导下，中国人民才站起来了。我真不知道，为什么还有人会有亲美情绪，留恋美国生活？除非是昧了良心，不辨是非，认贼作父的人，才会有这种想法。右派分子睁开眼睛，看看新中国八年来的成就吧！与美国的所谓“民主、自由、平等”对比一下吧！应该清醒过来了。我们热爱祖国，热爱我们的党，热爱我们的社会主义制度。右派分子赶快回头吧！
