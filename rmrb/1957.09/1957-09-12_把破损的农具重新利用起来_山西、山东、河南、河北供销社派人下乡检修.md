Reutilizing Damaged Farm Tools
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei Send Personnel to Rural Areas for Inspection and Repair

    This newspaper reports: Over the past few years, supply and marketing cooperatives in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces have supplied agricultural cooperatives with more than 710,000 double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows, 6,300 seeders and harvesters, more than 7,300 portable steam engines, gas engines, and diesel engines, and more than 1.22 million various iron waterwheels. After several years of use, these farm tools and water conservancy tools have shown serious damage and loss of parts.

    In order to make good use of new-style farm tools and water conservancy tools in suitable areas, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have strengthened the supply of parts and repair work. The Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system has successively dispatched 383 technical cadres to cooperate with technical workers from manufacturing factories to repair farm tools in 1,800 agricultural cooperatives. Through repairs, Xia County has managed to put more than 90% of its machinery back into use. Supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in Shandong Province have also taken parts to agricultural cooperatives for comprehensive inspection and repair. According to statistics from forty-seven counties, more than 200,000 pieces of various farm tools have been repaired.

    In order to meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives, they are actively organizing the supply of parts while carrying out repairs. As of now, Hebei Province has stocked more than 720,000 pieces of 123 different types of new-style farm tool parts. The Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is organizing local handicraft cooperatives to process parts themselves. The Wendeng County Cooperative has proactively contacted handicraft cooperatives and is now able to manufacture more than 70 types of parts. (Xu Qianxiang)

　　把破损的农具重新利用起来
　　山西、山东、河南、河北供销社派人下乡检修
    本报讯　几年来，山西、山东、河南、河北等省供销社供应了农业社双轮双（单）铧犁七十一万多部，播种机、收割机六千三百部，锅驼机、煤气机、柴油机七千三百多部，还有各种铁制水车一百二十二万多部。这些农具和水利工具通过几年来的使用，发现损坏和丢失零件现象很严重。
    为了把新式农具水利工具在适合使用的地区好好使用起来，各地供销社加强了零件供应和检修工作。山西省供销社系统已先后抽调技术干部三百八十三人配合制造工厂的技术工人在一千八百个农业社检修农具。夏县通过检修，使90％以上的机器全部使用起来了。山东省的供销合作社和手工业社，还携带零件深入农业社进行全面的检查修配，据四十七个县的统计，已检修好各种农具二十余万件。
    为了满足农业社的需要，在检修的同时，积极组织零件货源进行供应。截至目前止，河北省已储备了各种新式农具零件一百二十三种共七十二万多件。山东省供销社，组织当地手工业社自行加工零件。文登县社主动的与手工业社联系，已能自制零件七十余种。　（徐前香）
