Xinhua News Agency, Marseilles, 15th. More than ten fires have broken out in the resort areas along the Mediterranean coast of southern France and on the island of Corsica across the sea in the past two days. The fires spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry weather. Large areas of forests, vineyards and olive groves have been burned, resulting in very heavy losses.

　　By the 14th, approximately 8,000 hectares of forest on Corsica had been destroyed by fire. The French Ministry of the Interior has ordered the fire brigades of Paris and forest fire brigades from other inland cities to be airlifted to Corsica to provide support.

　　The fires near Nice were still raging as of the 14th. An area of approximately 5,000 hectares of farmland was reduced to ashes by the fire in a matter of hours. Four tourists from northern France have been arrested. They are accused of carelessly throwing cigarette butts, causing the fire.

　　法国南部大火
    新华社15日讯　马赛消息：法国南部沿地中海的避暑胜地和隔海的科西嘉岛这两天先后发生十余处大火。火势趁着大风和干燥的气候蔓延很快。大片森林、葡萄园和橄榄园被焚，损失十分重大。
    到14日为止，科西嘉岛上已经有大约八千公顷的森林被焚毁。法国内政部已经下令把巴黎的救火队和其他内陆城市的森林消防队空运到科西嘉去支援。
    尼斯附近的火势到14日为止仍然很猖獗。一片大约五千公顷的田园在数小时内被大火化为灰烬。已经有四个来自法国北部的游客被捕。他们被控随意抛掷烟头以致引起火灾。
