The Struggle Between Two Roads on the Grain Issue
——A Record of the Great Grain Debate in the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative——
Bai Xinghua

(Continued from yesterday)

Does hiding yields represent the interests of the masses?

After resolving the ideological problems of the broad masses of cooperative members, the Party branch led an ideological struggle against the wealthy middle peasants who led the "grain shortage" clamor and stirred up the "grain shortage" malpractices. First, a struggle was carried out within the management committee against the cooperative cadres whose capitalist thinking was serious. Liu Tingfu, Zhang Zizhi, and others, who had consistently concealed yields and led the "grain shortage" clamor, had to admit their mistakes after seeing that the peasants had distinguished right from wrong and they were isolated. They made self-criticisms in the management committee, admitting that their capitalist thinking was the main cause of the "grain shortage" trend. However, they also believed that their advocacy of concealing yields and handing over less surplus grain was to allow the peasants to eat more grain, to "represent the interests of the masses," and to "follow the mass line." So, is concealing yields beneficial to the peasants? Another fierce debate unfolded within the management committee. Initially, they thought that "the masses benefit from eating more grain and lose from eating less." Later, everyone examined the harms caused by the "grain shortage" clamor: First, it disrupted the thinking of the masses and dampened the enthusiasm of the peasants for production. Second, some cooperative cadres were "clamoring for grain" while others were coping with the "grain shortage" clamor, and they could not lead production well. Third, it created a bad atmosphere among some peasants of eating from "the state," "the cooperative," not conserving grain, and telling lies, and it also wasted the state's grain. Fourth, it created gaps for the destructive activities of former landlords and rich peasant elements. These all affected the consolidation of the cooperative. For example, some wealthy middle peasants were happy to see the chaos caused by the "grain shortage" clamor and said, "The advanced cooperative will not survive this year." This exposed those cooperative cadres who considered themselves to be standing on the side of the masses to "clamor for grain," proving that they were standing on the capitalist side for their personal gain, not for the benefit of the masses.

Debate Meeting

At this time, in order to make the cooperative members thoroughly distinguish right from wrong, the cooperative organized a debate meeting for those who stirred up the most trouble about the grain shortage (held in three sections throughout the cooperative).

The first debate target was Liu Tianshou, a former rich peasant element. His mother stood up and said, "I heard that some people said I was 'clamoring for grain.' My family really has no grain to eat. If you don't believe me, go search my house." Zhang Buyu immediately exposed her, saying, "You have consistently resisted the unified purchase and sale system. Since 1954, you have resisted handing over the unified purchase task every year and 'clamored for grain' every year. One dark night in 1954, your family pulled back a large cart of corn from the field and hid it, but 'clamored for grain shortage.' You only sold it in 1955 when there was a free market." Then, her neighbor, Liu Yuyin, exposed him, saying, "You not only hid a cart of corn but also hid dozens of bundles of sorghum, but you cried and cried all day saying you had nothing to eat. You roasted soybeans in front of people during the day and ate good things behind closed doors at night." Someone else exposed her: "Last year, your whole family averaged more than 450 catties of grain per person, but you started clamoring for supplies in the spring, cheating the state out of 75 catties of supply grain. As a result, your son sold old grain when he went to the engineering team." Liu Tingfu, the management committee member who had previously advocated concealing yields, also stood up to expose her. Because the arguments were sufficient and the evidence was solid, Liu Tianshou was speechless.

The second debate target was Liu Xiangyi, an old upper-middle peasant. Someone exposed him as a household ideologically lacking grain. His wife pretended to be so hungry that she couldn't eat and cried in the street all day, defrauding the state of 36 catties of supply grain, but she was drying a mat of millet in the courtyard. The grain his son sold when he went to the engineering team was old grain infested with insects. Liu Xiangyi defended himself, saying, "The insect-infested grain was received from the engineering team," and also said it was borrowed from his daughter's family. Everyone debated with facts and reason, leaving Liu Xiangyi with no way to refute, so he had to admit his mistake.

The third debate target was Liu Yingrui. Fearing that others would expose him, he first stood up and said, "My family is really short of grain." Jia Xiuying immediately retorted, "You are not really short of grain. One day I saw you grinding wheat and asked you: Your family said they had nothing to eat and received 28 catties of state supply grain, where did the wheat come from? You said there was no autumn grain, not that there was no wheat." Liu Yingrui still defended himself, saying, "There is some wheat at home, but no autumn grain." Youth League member Hao Suli then stood up and said, "Fourth Uncle, your family still has autumn grain. I saw you grinding a morning of millet after the supplies." Liu Yingrui again defended himself, saying, "I ate some supply grain, but I never clamored for a grain shortage." Hao Peixing retorted, "When did you not clamor? You pulled bitter vegetables from the field to feed the pigs, and you told others that people were eating them!" Liu Yingrui was speechless from the crowd's rebuttals, and repeatedly apologized to everyone, saying, "I will never make trouble again."

After face-to-face reasoning and debate, those who created a tense atmosphere about grain were isolated one by one.

Why did poor peasants and lower-middle peasants also clamor for grain?

After the debate meeting, the truth about the "grain shortage" clamor was revealed. But some wealthy middle peasants said, "Poor peasants and lower-middle peasants also clamored for grain, why aren't they being criticized?" And the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants who had clamored for grain also felt that they lacked justification. At this time, the Party branch and the work team organized another forum for the peasants to review why they had followed the wealthy middle peasants in clamoring for grain. Everyone reviewed two reasons: First, they were influenced and threatened by the wealthy middle peasants. For example, Liu Guodong said, "I worked actively in the fields, but some people who were 'clamoring for grain' cursed me, 'What are you eating?'" Someone exposed that the wealthy middle peasant Jing Yingxu saw a cooperative member eating dry rice and scolded him: "You don't eat dry rice at home, you eat it in the street. If the cadres see it, won't they say you have grain?" Some checked themselves, saying, "In the atmosphere of grain shortage, we wanted to be a grain shortage household even if we ate a catty of supply grain." Second, it was due to excessive waste of grain in the past. Most people believed that too much wheat had been distributed last summer, thinking that they didn't know how much would be distributed in the autumn, and thinking that there would be no limit to eating grain after entering the advanced cooperative. Cooperative cadre Yan Shengren checked himself, saying, "After the wheat was distributed last year, we were eating grain in a big way. Noodles in the morning, dry cakes at noon, and no thin porridge." He checked himself for wasting at least half a month's worth of grain in the past two months, and also checked the waste of often feeding pigs with leftover rice and feeding pigs with corn soaked in water. Everyone said, "Eating grain like this is not enough no matter how much there is!" After such a forum, everyone unanimously agreed that "grain should be saved." "In the future, we must eat according to the grain distributed from the cooperative in a planned way, and we cannot spend extravagantly and then ask the government for more."

The atmosphere has completely changed

After more than ten days of intense reasoning and debate, the malpractice of clamoring for grain disappeared. In order to consolidate the results of the great debate, the cooperative held a cooperative members' meeting and conducted a summary education. At the meeting, the cooperative cadres Liu Tingfu, Zhang Zizhi, and others who provoked the grain shortage turmoil made self-criticisms. Liu Tianshou, a rich peasant element who deliberately clamored for grain, stirred up trouble, scolded cadres, and undermined the cooperative, was dealt with by revoking his cooperative member status and placing him under supervised control in the cooperative. Liu Xiangyi and Li Chunsheng, old upper-middle peasants who were dissatisfied with the cooperative and deliberately created a tense atmosphere on the grain issue and led the grain shortage clamor, were made to return the supply grain they had defrauded. Fu Nong Liu Dong, who was exposed in the debate, was given a rich peasant label again and expelled from the cooperative. Several people who did not work in the cooperative and engaged in commercial speculation and "clamored for grain" were criticized. This further clarified the boundaries of right and wrong for the cooperative members.

After this great debate, the atmosphere in the Red Star Cooperative completely changed. Some cooperative members said, "It's really effective! After a few meetings, the village changed its appearance with a 'whoosh'." Everyone compared the situation before and after the debate and felt that there were four changes: First, the frowning "grain shortage" situation disappeared, and no one said that 380 catties were not enough to eat. Those who used to tell lies told the truth. Second, the phenomenon of eating grain extravagantly and wasting grain was changed, and a new trend of saving grain emerged. Saving surplus grain became glorious, and wasting grain and being short of grain became shameful. Third, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for labor was improved. In the past, some people said that whether they worked in the cooperative or not, they would get a share of grain. Now they see that they can eat more grain by working more. Therefore, some cooperative members who were mischievous and not actively working in the past took the initiative to ask to be assigned agricultural work. Fourth, the cadres of the management committee were united. The cooperative cadres who advocated concealing yields and deceiving the country in the past admitted their mistakes and realized that the disunity among the cadres was entirely due to capitalist thinking.

    粮食问题上两条道路的斗争
    ——记红星农业社粮食问题大辩论的经过——

   （续　昨）
    隐瞒产量是不是代表群众利益？
    广大社员的思想问题解决以后，党支部领导向带头“闹粮”、掀起“闹粮”歪风的富裕中农展开了思想斗争。首先在管理委员会内部对资本主义思想严重的社干部进行了斗争。一贯隐瞒产量、带头“闹粮”的刘廷富、张子治等人，由于看到农民分清了是非，使他们陷于孤立，不得不承认了自己的错误，在管理委员会作了检讨，承认他们的资本主义思想是造成“闹粮”风潮的主要原因。可是，他们又认为，他们主张隐瞒产量，少交余粮是为了让农民多吃粮食，是“代表群众的利益”，是“走了群众路线”。那么，隐瞒产量对农民是不是有利呢？管理委员会内又展开了一场激烈的争辩。开始，他们认为“群众多吃了粮就有利，少吃粮就没利”。后来，大家检查了“闹粮”造成的危害：第一、扰乱了群众的思想，打击了农民的生产积极性。第二、社干部有的“闹粮”有的应付“闹粮”，不能很好领导生产。第三、使部分农民产生了吃“国家”，“吃社”，吃粮食不节约，说假话的坏风气，还浪费了国家的粮食。第四、给过去的地主、富农分子的破坏活动造下了空隙。这些，都影响到合作社的巩固。比如有些富裕中农看到“闹粮”所造成的混乱，高兴地说：“高级社过不了今年”。这样，就揭穿了那些自认为站在群众立场上“闹粮”的社干部，证明他们是站在资本主义的立场为个人打算，不是为了群众利益。
          辩论会
    这时，为了使社员彻底分清是非，社内对于闹粮最凶的人，组织了一次辩论大会（全社分三片开）。
    第一个辩论的对象是过去的富农分子刘天寿。他母亲站出来说：“听说有人说我‘闹粮’来，我家确是没粮吃了，不信去我家去搜。”张步雨马上揭发她说：“你是一贯抵抗统购统销的，从1954年开始，年年抗交统购任务，年年‘闹粮’。1954年一个黑夜，你家从地里拉回一大车玉米藏了起来，却‘闹缺粮’，1955年有了自由市场才出售。”接着，她的邻居刘玉印揭发他说：“你不但藏了一车玉米还藏了几十捆高粱，反而一天哭哭啼啼说你没吃的。你白天对着人炒豆子吃，黑夜关住门吃好东西。”又有人揭发她：“去年你全家每人平均分粮四百五十多斤，春天就开始闹供应，骗了国家供应粮七十五斤，结果你儿去工程队时粜的是陈谷子”。原来主张隐瞒产量的管理委员刘廷富也站出来揭露了她。由于辩论的理由充足，证据确凿，驳得刘天寿闭口无言。
    第二个辩论的对象是老上中农刘相义。有人揭发他是思想缺粮户。他老婆假装饿得吃不上饭在街上哭了一天，骗领了国家的供应粮三十六斤，可是在院里晒了一席子谷。他儿到工程队时粜的粮食是生了虫的陈粮。刘相义辩解：“生虫粮食是从工程队领的”，又说是从姑娘家借的。大家都以事实和道理辩得刘相义无理反驳，只好承认自己错了。
    第三个辩论的对象是刘应瑞。他害怕别人揭发，首先站出来说：“我家是真缺粮。”贾秀英立即反驳道：“你就不是真缺粮，有一天我看见你磨小麦，问你道：你家不是说没吃的了，领了国家的二十八斤供应粮，从哪里来的小麦？你说是没秋粮了，不是没小麦了。”刘应瑞还辩解说：“家中就有些小麦，没秋粮。”团员郝素丽接着站起来说：“四伯伯，你家还有秋粮哩，供应后我还见你碾过一早上谷。”刘应瑞又辩解说：“我是吃了些供应粮，但没有闹过缺粮”。郝培兴反驳道：“哪一天你不闹，你从地里拔喂猪的苦菜，还向别人说是人吃哩！”刘应瑞被众口驳得无话可说，接连向大家道歉说“今后再不胡闹了”。
    经过面对面的说理辩论，那些制造粮食紧张空气的人一个个孤立起来了。
    为什么贫农和下中农也闹粮？
    开过辩论会，“闹粮”的真相大白了。但有些富裕中农说：“贫农和下中农也闹过粮，为什么不批判？”而闹过粮的贫农和下中农也感到理缺。这时党支部和工作组又组织农民进行了一次座谈，让大家回顾为什么会跟着富裕中农闹粮。大家检讨有两个原因：第一，受了富裕中农的影响和威胁。如刘国栋说：“我在地里劳动积极，人家有些‘闹粮’的人就破口大骂，你吃上什么了？”有人揭发富裕中农景应旭见一个社员吃干饭，就骂道：“你吃干饭不在家中吃，在街上吃，叫干部看见不是说你有粮？”有的说：“咱说是缺个零花钱，人家‘闹粮’的人就指住眼窝说，你有粮食吃吗？”有的检查“在缺粮的空气笼罩下，我们就是吃一斤供应粮也想当个缺粮户”。第二，是由于过去吃粮过分浪费。大多数人都认为去年夏天分麦过多，以为秋天不知会分多少，以为入了高级社吃粮就没个底。社干部阎生仁检讨说：“去年分了小麦后就是大张旗鼓地吃粮嘛，早上面片，中午干饼，就不吃稀的嘛。”他检查去年两个月之中，最少浪费半个月的粮，还检讨了经常把剩饭喂猪，用水泡玉米喂猪等浪费现象。大家都说：“像这样吃粮有多少也不够！”经过这样的座谈，大家一致认为“吃粮食可要节约”。“今后要根据从社里所分到的粮食有计划地吃，不能大手大脚吃完再向公家要了”。
        空气完全变了
    经过十余天紧张的说理辩论之后，闹粮的歪风没有了。为了巩固大辩论的成果，社内召开了一次社员大会，进行了总结起来的教育。会上，让挑起闹粮风潮的社干部刘廷富、张子治等进行了检讨。对故意闹粮，挑事生非，谩骂干部，破坏合作社的富农分子刘天寿作了取消社员资格，留社管制的处理。对于不满意合作社，故意在粮食问题上制造紧张空气，带头闹粮的老上中农刘相义、李春生，让他们把骗取的供应粮退出来。给在辩论中揭发出来的反攻富农刘东重新戴上富农帽子，开除出社。批评了几个不在社内劳动生产，专搞商业投机活动又“闹粮”的人。这样，使社员进一步明确了是非界限。
    经过这场大辩论，红星社的空气完全变了。有的社员说：“真是灵呀！开了几次大会，村里
  ‘擦’地就变了个样。”大家对比了辩论前后的情况，感到有四个变化：第一，愁眉苦脸的“闹粮”情况没有了，再没有人说三百八不够吃了。那些过去说假话的人说真话了。第二，改变了吃粮大手大脚、浪费粮食的现象，出现了节约粮食的新风尚。节约有余粮成了光荣，浪费缺粮成了可耻。第三，社员的劳动积极性提高了。过去有些人说受不受社内也得给分一份粮，现在看到多劳动才能多吃粮，因此，过去有些调皮，不积极劳动的社员都主动要求分配农活。第四，管理委员会干部之间团结了。过去主张隐瞒产量欺骗国家的社干部承认了错误，认识了干部之间的不团结，完全是资本主义思想作怪。（完）
