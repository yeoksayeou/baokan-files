Riding a Donkey to Find a Donkey

　　There was a factory where the masses raised more than seven thousand suggestions during the "speaking out" period. The leading cadres of this factory sincerely implemented the policy of "rectifying while correcting," carefully studied the suggestions made by the masses, and formulated solutions and designated responsible persons for all problems that could be solved. Then, they convened a workers' representative meeting to explain the situation to the masses. However, after holding the meeting continuously for four and a half hours, only over a hundred issues were explained. The factory director was tired from reporting, and the representatives were also tired of listening.

　　If it takes four and a half hours to explain over a hundred issues, and every one of the seven thousand suggestions needs to be addressed, how much time would that take? If things continue like this, not only will the leading cadres be exhausted and unable to cope, but the representatives' production will be delayed, and the rectification and correction will not be completed until who knows when.

　　The leading cadres were worried and couldn't think of a solution. At this time, a responsible comrade from the higher authorities came. He was very surprised to see this situation and asked them: "You mobilized the masses to speak out freely, isn't that using the mass line method to expose shortcomings in your work? Why do you forget the mass line when improving these shortcomings and not let the masses solve the problems?"

　　The leading cadres suddenly realized and sighed, "We were already riding on the donkey's back, but we didn't know it and were still working hard to find the donkey."

　　骑驴找驴
    有一个工厂，群众在鸣放中提出了七千多条意见。这个厂的领导干部诚心诚意地贯彻“边整边改”的方针，逐条研究了群众的意见，凡是可以解决的问题都拟定了解决办法和负责执行的人，然后召开职工代表大会向群众交代。但是，不停歇地开了四个半小时的会，只交代完了一百多个问题。厂长报告得很累，代表们听得也很累。
    一百多个问题，要交代四个半小时；七千多条意见，件件要有交代，那得多少时间呢？这样搞下去，不要说领导干部要累得支持不住，代表们的生产耽搁不起，就说边整边改，要改到那年那月才能改完呢？
    领导干部们正在发愁，想不出办法，这时，上级机关来了一位负责同志。他看到这种情形很奇怪，便问他们道：你们发动群众大鸣大放，不正是运用群众路线的方法来揭露工作中的缺点吗？为什么改进这些缺点的时候，却又把群众路线忘了，不放手组织群众去解决问题呢？
    领导干部们恍然大悟，叹道：“我们已经骑在驴背上了，却不自知，还在辛辛苦苦地找驴。”
