Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, September 28th. This year, 4,821 agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province have caught up with or surpassed the production level of prosperous middle peasants, accounting for 16.53% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the province. In the Handan Special District, agricultural cooperatives reaching or exceeding the production level of prosperous middle peasants can reach 20% of the total number of cooperatives.

This spring, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to the entire province for agricultural cooperatives to catch up with or surpass the production level of prosperous middle peasants within three to five years. Local Party committees and county committees conducted investigations and research based on the production conditions of local prosperous middle peasants and different types of agricultural cooperatives, and widely exchanged views with members of all classes on how to catch up with the production level of prosperous middle peasants. According to the investigation, the unit area yield of prosperous middle peasants is generally 20% to 30% higher than that of newly established cooperatives. The main reasons are that prosperous middle peasants originally occupied better land, had stronger draught animals, more pigs and manure, higher multiple cropping index, and more careful cultivation. After extensive discussions, the broad masses of cooperative members recognized that cooperatives have superior conditions in production that the original prosperous middle peasants could not compare with. For example, unified land use, concentrated strength, facilitated planting according to local conditions, crop rotation, and promotion of basic construction, and the ability to adopt new technologies, improved varieties, and new agricultural tools. The members said that as long as the cooperatives actively exert their superior conditions, they will catch up with or exceed the production level of local prosperous middle peasants within three to five years, or even one to two years.

Many agricultural cooperatives have actively exerted their superior conditions in production, and after learning from the experience of prosperous middle peasants in diligently and thriftily managing production, they have rapidly improved the production level of agricultural cooperatives. For example, the Shenhou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Huolu County has 3,499 mu of cultivated land. In the past, the entire village only had 20 mu of paddy fields. After collectivization, irrigation channels were built, and 3,000 mu of dry land were transformed into paddy fields, increasing the yield by 75 jin per mu, catching up with the production level of prosperous middle peasants in the first year. The Shanggulin Village Agricultural Cooperative in Huanghua County, because it used collective strength to reclaim more than 3,000 mu of paddy fields, averaged 645 jin per mu last year, with an average income of 1,400 jin per member; this year, it is expected to harvest 850 jin per mu, with an income of 1,900 jin per person. The members happily said: Last year was "one for cultivation, two for surplus," and this year is "one for cultivation, three for surplus."

Currently, each special district in Hebei has a number of agricultural cooperatives that have formulated plans to catch up with or exceed the production level of prosperous middle peasants. According to the plan, by 1962, all 5,933 agricultural cooperatives in the Shijiazhuang Special District will have caught up with or exceeded the production level of prosperous middle peasants. By that time, this cotton-producing area that has been short of grain for many years can basically achieve self-sufficiency in grain. Based on the experience of local agricultural production increasing year by year, the Tangshan Special District plans that by 1960, more than 90% of the agricultural cooperatives in the entire special district will catch up with or exceed the production and living standards of prosperous middle peasants.

Guangzhou News. On the eve of National Day, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of Guangdong's agricultural department. This person said: According to recent statistics, the unit area yield of grain in eight counties and three cities in Guangdong has exceeded the target of 800 jin per mu on average. The facts of these eleven counties and cities show that it is entirely possible for Guangdong to complete the task of achieving an average yield of 800 jin per mu throughout the province by 1967, as required by the draft National Agricultural Development Program.

The eight counties that have overfulfilled and completed the average yield of 800 jin per mu ahead of schedule are Chaoan, Chaoyang, Jieyang, Puning, Nan'ao, Chenghai, and Raoping in the Shantou Special District, and Lianping in the Huiyang Special District. The three cities are Shantou, Chaozhou, and Foshan. Among these eight counties, the highest yields are in Chaoan and Chenghai, with an average yield of over 1,100 jin per mu. The lowest are Raoping and Lianping, with the former yielding 944 jin per mu and the latter yielding 819 jin per mu. Lianping is both a mountainous area and a non-high-yield area. Since it can reach the target of 800 jin per mu ahead of schedule, the Pearl River Delta and the Chaoshan Plain are even more likely to reach it ahead of schedule. According to the situation in these eleven counties and cities, the person in charge judged that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, that is, by the end of 1962, at least more than half of the counties and cities in Guangdong could reach the target of 800 jin per mu.

Guangdong has always been a grain-deficient province. Before liberation, it had to import three months' worth of grain from other provinces every year. In recent years, due to the continuous increase in grain production, several hundred million jin of grain have been transferred out every year. In 1952, Guangdong's total grain output was 18.9 billion jin. It is estimated that this year's output can reach 24.5 billion jin.

### 河北四千八百多个农业社赶上富裕中农生产水平  广东十一个县、市粮食亩产量超过八百斤

    河北四千八百多个农业社赶上富裕中农生产水平
    广东十一个县、市粮食亩产量超过八百斤
    新华社保定28日电　今年，河北省有四千八百二十一个农业社赶上或超过了富裕中农的生产水平，占全省农业社总数的16.53％。邯郸专区生产水平赶上或超过富裕中农的农业社，可达到社的总数的20％。
    今年春天，中共河北省委向全省提出了农业社要在三、五年内赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平的号召。各地委、县委根据当地富裕中农和不同类型农业社的生产情况，进行了调查研究，并和各阶层社员广泛地交换了如何赶上富裕中农生产水平的意见。根据调查，富裕中农的单位面积产量，比初建的合作社一般高20％到30％。其主要原因是富裕中农原来占有的土地好，畜力壮，猪多粪大，复种率高，耕作较细。广大社员经过讨论后，都认识了合作社在生产上有原来的富裕中农所不能比拟的优越条件。如土地统一使用，力量集中，便于因地种植、倒茬轮作和推行基本建设，能采用新技术、优良品种和新农具等。社员们说，合作社只要积极发挥自己的优越条件，就会在三、五年内甚至在一、二年内赶上或超过当地的富裕中农的生产水平。
    很多农业社积极发挥了自己在生产上的优越条件，并学习富裕中农勤俭经营生产的经验后，迅速提高了农业社的生产水平。如获鹿县神后村农业社，有耕地三千四百九十九亩，过去全村仅有二十亩水地，合作化后，修了渠道网，把三千亩旱地变成了水田，每亩增产七十五斤，头一年就赶上了富裕中农生产水平。黄骅县上古林村农业社，因为用集体力量开垦了三千多亩稻田，去年平均每亩产六百四十五斤，每个社员平均收入一千四百斤；今年预计每亩可收八百五十斤，每人收入一千九百斤。社员们高兴地说：去年是“耕一余二”，今年是“耕一余三”。
    现在，河北各专区已经有一批农业社作出了赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平的规划。按照规划，到1962年，石家庄专区的五千九百三十三个农业社，即可全部赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平。到那时，这个历年缺粮的产棉区，就可以基本上达到粮食自给。唐山专区根据本地农业生产逐年提高的经验，计划到1960年全专区90％以上的农业社赶上或超过富裕中农的生产和生活水平。
    本报广州讯　国庆节前夕，记者走访广东农业部门的负责人。这位负责人说：根据最近统计，广东已有八个县和三个市的粮食单位面积产量，超过了每亩平均产量八百斤的指标。这十一个县市的事实说明：广东完全可能按着农业发展纲要草案的要求，到1967年完成全省平均亩产八百斤的任务。
    超额和提前完成平均亩产八百斤的八个县，是汕头专区的潮安、潮阳、揭阳、普宁、南澳、澄海和饶平，以及惠阳专区的连平。三个市是汕头、潮州和佛山。在这八个县当中，产量最高的是潮安和澄海，平均亩产一千一百斤以上。最低的是饶平和连平，前者亩产九百四十四斤，后者亩产八百一十九斤。连平既是山区，又非高产区，它能够提前达到亩产八百斤的指标，珠江三角洲和潮汕平原就更有可能提前达到。负责人根据这十一个县、市的情况判断，到第二个五年计划末期，即1962年底，广东至少可以有半数以上的县市达到亩产八百斤的指标。
    广东历来是个缺粮省，解放前每年要从外省调来三个月的粮食。近几年来因为粮食产量的不断提高，每年都有几亿斤的粮食外调。1952年广东的粮食总产量是一百八十九亿斤，预计今年产量可以达到二百四十五亿斤。
