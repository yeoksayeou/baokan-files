Apocynum venetum
—A Promising Wild High-Grade Textile Fiber Plant
Chinese Academy of Sciences　Dong Zhengjun

    The People's Daily on September 6th, first page, carried a news item saying: Apocynum venetum grows in large quantities along the coast of Shandong; it is a valuable and promising raw material for the textile industry. The development of China's textile industry is currently limited by the supply of raw materials, so this news item has aroused great interest among readers. Some people asked: What are the characteristics of Apocynum venetum fiber? What is its growth situation in China? What is the current state of its utilization? How much impact will it have on the development of China's textile industry...? Since 1952, I have been using my spare time to study the growth, cultivation, and utilization of Apocynum venetum, and now I would like to briefly discuss these issues.

    Apocynum venetum has more than a dozen different names in China. In Shandong, some call it tea stalk; some call it river horse seedling; some call it red hairy stalk. In Hebei and Shanxi, it is called tea flower. In northern Jiangsu, it is called wild tea leaf. In Guanzhong, Shaanxi, Hexi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, it is called wild hemp. In Qinghai, it is called Zaha. In ethnic minority areas, it also has various different names. The name Apocynum venetum was given in 1952 when I found that the largest quantity and best growth of wild hemp were in the Lop Nur plain in the eastern Tarim Basin of Xinjiang, so it was named after the place of origin.

    Apocynum venetum belongs to the Apocynaceae family. More than a dozen species have now been discovered. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into two types: red hemp and white hemp. The stem of red hemp is purple-red, the flowers are relatively small, also purple-red or pink, and the plant height is one to four meters. The stem of white hemp is green, the flowers are pink, and the plant height is one to one and a half meters.

    The fiber quality of Apocynum venetum in China is better than that of cotton, flax, and ramie, and the fineness and strength (tensile strength) are even better than that of fine wool. It can spin at least 60-count yarn, and good ones can spin 160-count yarn, which can be used to replace fine wool for weaving. The results of scientific testing show that the fiber quality of Apocynum venetum is compared with the main textile fibers currently used in China (single fiber) as follows:

(A table is meant to be here. The information to create this table is missing.)

    The above information shows that Apocynum venetum is a wild high-grade textile fiber plant. The East China Textile Administration Bureau has already trial-spun 160-count high-grade fine yarn (spun alone or blended with cotton, silk, and fine wool), and used these yarns to trial-weave more than a dozen kinds of beautiful and durable high-grade clothing fabrics such as gabardine, valitin, fine linen, hemp flannel (for making undershirts and pants), ladies' woolen cloth, hemp silk, hemp crepe, and various colored tweeds. Moreover, based on the fineness, strength, and resistance to long-term wind, sun, and rain of Apocynum venetum fiber, it is speculated that it can also be used to weave fabrics for aviation, navigation, machine transmission belts, tires, fire hoses, rubber boats, etc., and can also be used to manufacture strong, thin, high-grade paper.

    Can Apocynum venetum be used in large quantities in the textile industry? This depends on whether the yield of Apocynum venetum is high and whether the production cost is low. According to existing data, it is entirely possible to supply Apocynum venetum in large quantities through some effort. Apocynum venetum has roots that are about two meters deep, which can penetrate the surface layer of soil with high salt content, absorb the nutrients in the lower layer of soil with lower salt content and deep groundwater. Therefore, its vitality is very strong, and it is drought-resistant, cold-resistant, and salt-resistant. In desert areas with annual rainfall of less than 100 mm, and even in the southern Xinjiang desert edge areas with annual rainfall of only 50 mm, there is also naturally growing Apocynum venetum (general crops need irrigation to grow normally in areas with rainfall below 300 mm). In the Altai region of Xinjiang, where the absolute minimum temperature reaches minus 47°C, there is also naturally growing Apocynum venetum. In Xinjiang, the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, and the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, there is also naturally growing Apocynum venetum on heavy saline soil with a salt crust of 10 to 20 cm thick on the surface. Up to now, we have discovered that Apocynum venetum grows in areas north of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Huai River Basin, the Qinling Mountains, the Bayan Har Mountains, and the Kunlun Mountains, as well as in Altai, Inner Mongolia, Chengde, Dalian, and other places. Among them, it grows the most in the Qaidam Basin and the most luxuriantly in the Tarim Basin. In the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, the lower reaches of the Ejin River in western Inner Mongolia, and the barren land in the coastal areas of Shandong and Hebei, tens of acres, thousands of acres, or even tens of thousands of acres of Apocynum venetum are connected in a continuous stretch, making it impossible to see the end. The estimated annual production of raw hemp is at least 1.5 million dan (75,000 metric tons).

    Our experiments have proved that Apocynum venetum can be cultivated artificially on arid and saline wasteland. The cultivated Apocynum venetum is the same as the wild one. It can live for 30 years after planting once and can be harvested twice a year. However, the yield of raw hemp per unit area is higher than that of the wild one. For example, in wild hemp fields, there are generally only 20,000 to 30,000 hemp plants per mu (667 sq meters), while there are 50,000 to 60,000 weeds (wormwood). During artificial cultivation, weeds can be greatly reduced, and 60,000 to 90,000 plants can be planted per mu. The greater the density of hemp, the fewer branches, and the taller the plants, so the yield of raw hemp per unit area is higher, and the quality is better. The plant height of wild hemp is one to four meters, and the artificial cultivation reaches at least 1.5 meters. Based on 60,000 plants per mu, each plant being 1.5 meters high, harvesting once a year, each mu can produce 300 jin (150 kg) of raw hemp per year. If the plant height reaches 2.5 to 3 meters, and harvested twice a year, each mu may produce more than 1,000 jin (500 kg) of raw hemp per year. There are more than 200 million mu of arid and saline wasteland in Northwest China and along the coast. If Apocynum venetum can be planted on 30 million mu of wasteland, each mu producing 200 jin (100 kg) of raw hemp per year (the most conservative estimate), 60 million dan (3 million metric tons) of raw hemp can be obtained throughout the year. After degumming, 30 million dan (1.5 million metric tons) of refined hemp can be obtained, which is equivalent to the total annual output of raw cotton in China. From the perspective of use value, one jin (0.5 kg) of Apocynum venetum refined hemp is at least equivalent to two jin (1 kg) of cotton (cotton averages 20 to 30 count yarn, Apocynum venetum at least 60 count yarn). In other words, if we plant 30 million mu of Apocynum venetum, and each mu produces 200 jin of raw hemp, the annual output of yarn and cloth in China can be increased by two times compared to the present. If each mu produces 300 jin or 400 jin of raw hemp, the annual output of yarn and cloth can increase three or four times.

    It has been more than five years since the discovery of Apocynum venetum in 1952. In these five years, the utilization of Apocynum venetum in China has not been good enough. Now, except for a few places where it is used to weave fishing nets, the vast majority is burned as firewood. The reason is that one or two years ago, the cost of peeling and degumming hemp was too high, with each kilogram of refined hemp costing 6.9 yuan (including 0.8 yuan for raw hemp purchase, 0.8 yuan for transportation, and 5.3 yuan for degumming), and the cost of textiles was also too high, and no one could afford it. Moreover, at that time, hemp was peeled manually, and each person could only peel 0.5 to 1 kilogram per day, so there was a problem with supplying large quantities. Now, these two technical problems have been largely resolved. In terms of degumming, we found that the masses in the rural areas of Yuli County, Xinjiang, used indigenous alkali for degumming, and the degumming rate could reach 58.4%-59% (the degumming rate in Shanghai using modern degumming methods is 59%), and the degumming cost per kilogram was only about 0.7 yuan. After research, this method can be improved, and the cost can be reduced. In terms of hemp peeling, this spring, we modified the Ishii hemp peeling machine at the Wulin Iron Factory in Hangzhou and then took it to Xinjiang for use. As a result, each machine could peel 25 kilograms of raw hemp per hour, the quality was quite good, and the cost of peeling hemp per kilogram was only 0.1 yuan. If the Dongxian hemp peeling machine is modified, the hemp peeling efficiency may be further improved, and the cost will be reduced. If the above two types of hemp peeling machines can be modified to use animal or water power as power (now diesel engines are used), then hemp can be peeled and degummed in the production area. This will not only reduce power costs but also reduce transportation costs.

    From the information introduced above, we can say that developing and utilizing Apocynum venetum is a promising and important way to solve the problem of raw materials for China's textile industry by utilizing a large amount of arid and saline wasteland.

    The utilization of Apocynum venetum requires the cooperation of agriculture, reclamation, textile, trade, machine manufacturing, and scientific research departments. This requires the establishment of a special organization for experimental research on Apocynum venetum, under the unified leadership of relevant government departments, to carry out work in a planned and step-by-step manner. The work that needs to be done at present, I think: First, although the hemp peeling, degumming, and textile work have been successfully tested, other problems will be encountered when large-scale formal production is carried out in the future. At present, larger-scale processing and textile experiments should be carried out to improve fiber quality, reduce costs, and prepare for formal production. Second, protect natural hemp fields and carry out larger-scale artificial cultivation work. In the past, when Shandong and Xinjiang vigorously reclaimed wasteland, because they did not know the use of Apocynum venetum, they used to reclaim it as weeds and improve saline soil, which is a pity. In the future, the large areas of wild Apocynum venetum that grow well should be protected and further artificially cultivated, weeds should be removed, and replanting should be intensified to increase the yield and quality of Apocynum venetum per unit area. Third, in areas with development prospects, establish cultivation test fields to study cultivation methods and select excellent varieties for large-scale planting in the future. Fourth, organize professional surveying teams, equipped with agricultural, soil plant, and surveying personnel, to carry out comprehensive and systematic surveying work. Find out the area and yield of existing wild Apocynum venetum, find out the area of wasteland that can be developed, and so on.

　　罗布麻
　　——一种很有发展前途的野生高级纺织纤维植物
　　中国科学院　董正钧
    9月6日人民日报第一版，有一则新闻说：罗布麻在山东沿海大量生长；它是一种有价值、有发展前途的纺织工业原料。我国纺织工业的发展，当前正受着原料供应的限制，所以这一则新闻很引起读者的兴趣。有的人问道：罗布麻纤维的特点怎样？它在我国生长的情况怎样？目前利用的情形怎样？它对我国纺织工业的发展到底有多大作用……？我从1952年起，就利用业余时间研究罗布麻的生长、栽培和利用的情况，现在想简单地谈一谈这些问题。
    罗布麻，在我国有着十几个不同的名儿。在山东，有的叫茶棵子；有的叫河马秧子；有的叫红毛子棵。在河北和山西，叫茶叶花。在苏北，叫野叶茶。在陕西关中、甘肃河西和新疆，叫野麻。在青海，叫扎哈。在少数民族地区，也有着各种不同的名称。罗布麻这种名儿，是1952年我在新疆塔里木盆地东部的罗布平原，发现那儿的野麻数量最多，生长最好，才以产地命名的。
    罗布麻属于夹竹桃科。现在已发现的有十多种种类。从大的方面分，可以分为红麻和白麻两种。红麻的茎紫红色，花比较小，也是紫红色或粉红色，株高一至四公尺。白麻的茎绿色，花粉红色，株高一至一点五公尺。
    我国罗布麻的纤维品质比棉花、亚麻、苎麻的都好，细度和强力（拉力）甚至比细羊毛还好。至少可以纺60支纱，好的可以纺160支纱，可以用来代替细羊毛织布。科学检验的结果，罗布麻纤维品质与我国现在所用的主要纺织纤维比较（单纤维）如下：
    上面的资料说明：罗布麻是一种野生高级纺织纤维植物。华东纺织管理局已经试纺成160支高级细纱（单纺或和棉花、丝、细羊毛混纺），并用这些纱试织成华达呢、凡立丁、细麻布、麻绒布（做卫生衫裤）、女色呢、麻绫纺、麻绢绸和各色花呢等十数种美丽、坚实的高级衣料。而且根据罗布麻纤维的细度、强力和不怕长久的风吹、日晒、雨淋等特点推测，它还可以织航空、航海、机器传动带、轮胎、水龙带、橡皮艇等方面用布，也可以制造坚牢细薄的高级用纸。
    在纺织工业中能不能大量采用罗布麻呢？这要看罗布麻的产量是不是很多和生产成本是不是低廉。根据现有的资料来看，经过一番努力，大量供应罗布麻是完全可能的。罗布麻有二公尺左右的深根，能穿过含盐较重的土壤表层，吸收含盐较轻的土壤下层的养分和深层地下水，所以，它的生活力非常强，能耐旱，耐寒，耐盐。在全年雨量一百毫米以下的沙漠地区，甚至在全年雨量只有五十毫米的新疆南部沙漠边缘地区，也有天然生长的罗布麻（一般作物在雨量三百毫米以下的地区，需要灌溉才能正常生长）。在绝对最低温度达零下47°C的新疆阿尔泰地区，也有天然生长的罗布麻。在新疆、甘肃河西和青海柴达木盆地的地表结有十到二十公分厚盐壳的重盐土上，也有天然生长的罗布麻。到现在为止，我们已经发现：我国长江下游以北、淮河流域、秦岭、巴颜喀啦山和昆仑山以北各地，以及阿尔泰、内蒙古、承德、大连等地，都有罗布麻生长。其中以柴达木盆地生长得最多，塔里木盆地生长得最盛。在甘肃河西走廊、内蒙古西部额齐纳河下游和山东、河北滨海地区的荒地上，数十亩、数千亩甚至数万亩的罗布麻连成一片，使人望不到头。每年生产的原麻估计最少有一百五十万担。
    我们的试验证明，在干旱盐咸荒地上，完全可以用人工栽培罗布麻。栽培出来的罗布麻和野生的一样，种一次可以活三十年，每年可以收两次，但是，单位面积的原麻产量要比野生的高。比如在野生麻田里，每亩一般只有二万至三万株麻，杂草（蒿草）则有五、六万株。人工栽培时，可以大大减少杂草，每亩可以种植六万至九万株。麻的密度愈大，分枝就愈少，植株就愈高，所以单位面积的原麻产量也就愈高，品质也愈好。野生麻的株高一至四公尺，人工栽培的至少达到一点五公尺。就以每亩六万株，每株高一点五公尺计算，每年收割一次，每亩每年就可以生产原麻三百斤。如果株高达到二点五到三公尺，每年收割两次，每亩每年就有可能生产原麻一千斤以上。我国西北和沿海有干旱和盐咸荒地二亿亩以上，若能在三千万亩的荒地上种植罗布麻，每亩每年以生产原麻二百斤（最保守的估计）计算，全年就可以得原麻六千万担，脱胶后可得精麻三千万担，相当于现有我国每年原棉的总产量。从使用价值来看，一斤罗布麻精麻至少抵二斤棉花用（棉花平均纺20支到30支纱，罗布麻至少纺60支纱）。换句话说，如果我们种植三千万亩罗布麻，每亩生产原麻二百斤，每年我国的纱布产量就可以比现在增加两倍。如果每亩生产原麻三百斤或四百斤，纱布年产量就可以增长三倍或四倍。
    从1952年发现罗布麻起，到现在已经五年多了。在这五年多里，我国对罗布麻的利用的情况是不够好的。现在，只有个别地方用来织鱼网以外，绝大部分都被当柴烧。原因是一、二年以前，剥麻和脱胶的成本太高，每公斤精麻要6.9元（其中原麻收购0.8元，运费0.8元，脱胶5.3元），纺织品的成本也跟着太高，没人买得起。而且当时都是用人工剥麻，每人每天只能剥半公斤到一公斤，要大量供应也有问题。现在，这两个技术问题大体上已经解决。在脱胶方面，我们在新疆尉犁县农村里，发现群众用土碱脱胶，折炼率可以达到58.4％—59％（上海用现代化的脱胶法，折炼率是59％），每公斤的脱胶成本只要0.7元左右。经过研究以后，这个方法还可以改进，成本还可以降低。剥麻方面，今年春天，我们在杭州武林铁工厂把石井式剥麻机改装一下，然后拿到新疆使用，结果每部机器每小时可以剥原麻二十五公斤，品质相当好，每公斤剥麻成本只要0.1元。若改装东纤式剥麻机，剥麻效率可能还要提高一些，成本还会降低一些。要是把上述两种剥麻机翻改得可以用畜力或水力作动力（现在是用柴油机），那末便可以在产地剥麻，在产地脱胶。这样，不仅可以降低动力费，还可以降低运输费。
    从上面所介绍的资料来看，我们可以说：发展和利用罗布麻，是利用大量干旱盐咸荒地来解决我国纺织工业原料问题的一个很有希望的重要办法。
    利用罗布麻，需要农业、垦殖、纺织、贸易、机器制造和科学研究等部门共同配合才行。这就需要成立一个专门试验研究罗布麻的组织，由政府有关部门统一领导，有计划、有步骤地开展工作。目前需要做的工作，我认为：一、剥麻脱胶和纺织等工作虽然已试验成功，但将来大规模正式生产的时候还会遇到别的问题。现在应进行较大规模的加工和纺织试验工作，提高纤维品质，降低成本，为正式生产作好准备。二、保护天然麻田，进行较大规模的人工培育工作。过去，山东和新疆大力开垦荒地的时候，因为不知罗布麻的用途，曾经把它作为野草来开垦，把带咸的土壤加以改良，这是很可惜的。今后，对那些生长良好的大片野生罗布麻，应加以保护，并进一步加以人工培育，割除杂草，补植加密，以便提高罗布麻单位面积产量，提高质量。三、在有发展前途的地区，设立栽培试验场，研究栽培方法，选育优良品种，以便将来大量种植。四、组织专业勘测队，配备农业、土壤植物和测量人员，进行全面的系统的勘测工作。查清现有野生罗布麻的面积和产量，查清可能发展的荒地面积等等。
