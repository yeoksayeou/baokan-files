    West Germany's New Industry – Buying and Selling Workers

    A new industry of buying and selling workers has emerged in West Germany in recent years. This has been exposed recently by some West German newspapers.

    According to news reports, there are some "entrepreneurs" in West Germany who do not own factories but employ hundreds of workers. The purpose of employing them is to "rent" them to enterprises belonging to large concerns. According to "Der Spiegel" magazine, these operators of living commodities send these "bags of muscles" directly to the factory gates of those who "rent" them, and take them back after use. Factories buy these laborers as general commodities, sending them to work posts, "without going through the personnel department, but through the materials supply department, just like buying insulation materials and machine parts." Wages are not paid directly to the workers but to the operators of living commodities. According to the "Frankfurter Rundschau," the operators deduct a considerable portion for their own private pockets, and then give a very small portion to these victims of double exploitation.

    According to materials from the Metalworkers' Union, there are approximately 300,000 workers "rented out" in West Germany.

### 西德新行业——买卖工人

    西德新行业——买卖工人
    西德近几年来兴起了一种买卖工人的新行业。这是西德一些报刊最近揭发的。
    据报刊消息表明，西德有这么一些“企业主”，他们没有工厂，却雇佣了好几百工人，雇佣的目的是为了把他们“租给”大康采恩所属的企业。据“明镜”周刊报道，这些活商品的经营者把这些“肌肉袋”直接送到“租用”他们工厂的大门口，用完以后再收回。工厂把这些劳动力作为一般商品买进来，送上工作岗位，“无须经过人事科，而像购买绝缘器材和机器零件一样经过物资供应科”。工资不直接付给工人，而是付给活商品经营者。据“法兰克福评论报”说，经营者要从中扣除相当一部分归入自己私囊，而后才把极少的一部分给予这些双重剥削的牺牲者。
    据冶金工人工会材料，全西德被“出租”的工人约有三十万人。
