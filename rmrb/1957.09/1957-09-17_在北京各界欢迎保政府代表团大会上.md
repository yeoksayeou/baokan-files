Peng Zhen's Welcome Speech at the Beijing Municipal Circles' Welcome Meeting for the Bulgarian Government Delegation

Respected Comrade Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria,
Respected Comrades of the Bulgarian Government Delegation,
Comrades and Friends:

　　Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing are holding this meeting to welcome the close friends of the Chinese people, Comrade Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and all comrades of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to visit our country. We feel very honored and very happy. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of all the citizens of Beijing, to extend a warm welcome and sincere respect to Comrade Yugov and all the comrades of the delegation.
　　At the beginning of this year, our National People's Congress delegation and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee delegation visited Bulgaria and had cordial talks with leading comrades from all walks of life in Bulgaria. During our visit to Bulgaria, we were warmly welcomed and treated like brothers by the Bulgarian people and leading comrades from all sides. Everywhere we felt the great internationalist spirit of the Bulgarian people and their profound friendship towards the Chinese people. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks once again here. Our delegation visited some important cities in Bulgaria and visited many factories, power stations, reservoirs, agricultural production cooperatives, handicraft production cooperatives, and universities. We have seen with our own eyes the great achievements made by the industrious and brave Bulgarian people in all aspects of socialist construction under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government. This year is the last year of Bulgaria's second five-year plan, and the Bulgarian people are working with full confidence to complete the plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. The completion of this plan will further develop and improve Bulgaria's national economy and people's living standards. Bulgaria's achievements are also the common achievements of all our socialist countries. We are infinitely happy about this.
　　Bulgaria is a strong member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Bulgarian people have made many contributions to consolidating the unity of socialist countries. In international affairs, Bulgaria has unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy and has made unremitting efforts to defend peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people fully support this effort by the Bulgarian people and will continue to fight and advance side by side with the Bulgarian people.
　　There has long been a deep friendship between the peoples of China and Bulgaria. Comrade Dimitrov, the immortal leader of the Bulgarian people and an outstanding activist in the international workers' movement, is well-known and admired by the Chinese people. He gave strong support and encouragement to the Chinese people's liberation struggle and made immortal contributions to the establishment of friendship between the peoples of China and Bulgaria. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries in various fields have been developing more and more comprehensively.
　　This friendship cannot be hindered or destroyed by any force. Because we have the great Marxism-Leninism as our common guiding ideology, and the great cause of socialism and communism as our common goal of struggle.
　　Now, we are particularly pleased that Comrade Yugov has come to our capital and our country for the second time. At this time last year, Comrade Yugov led the Bulgarian Communist Party delegation to participate in the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, bringing the fraternal friendship of the Bulgarian people and leaving a deep impression on the Chinese people. This time, Comrade Yugov is leading the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria for a friendly visit to our country. We firmly believe that this visit will further strengthen the long-standing deep friendship between the peoples of our two countries, strengthen the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and be conducive to consolidating world peace and the noble cause of human progress.
　　Respected Comrade Yugov and all comrades of the delegation, let me once again extend the warmest welcome to you on behalf of the people from all walks of life in Beijing, and hope that you will give us criticism and correction on the shortcomings in our work at any time during your visit. Finally, please convey the infinite love and respect of the people of Beijing to the fraternal Bulgarian people.
　　Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Bulgaria!
　　Long live the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
　　Long live world peace!

Yugov's Speech

Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai,
Dear Comrade Peng Zhen,
Dear Chinese Comrades and Friends,
Men and Women Citizens of the Heroic Capital of the Great People's Republic of China!

　　Please allow me first, on behalf of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, to express my heartfelt thanks for the warm reception and enthusiastic welcome you have given us as representatives of the Bulgarian people—the people of Georgi Dimitrov.
　　We are honored to represent the Bulgarian people, the Bulgarian government, and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party at today's grand mass meeting to convey the warmest fraternal greetings to the working people of Beijing.
　　We have come to your country to once again demonstrate our unbreakable friendship and the indestructible unity between socialist countries, to demonstrate our determination to bravely advance side by side, and to fight for the cause of socialism, peace and cooperation among the peoples of all countries.
　　The Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is already in the capital of the People's Republic of China, the ancient city of Beijing, for the third day. During these days, we have met with the working people of your city, had the opportunity to visit some enterprises and cultural monuments in the city, and had talks with leaders of the state and the party. We now have the opportunity to meet directly, face-to-face, with you, dear Chinese comrades and friends, at this grand mass meeting. From your smiling faces and excited mood, we can feel even more strongly how profound is the love of the Chinese people for their loyal friends and brothers, the Bulgarian people, and how deep, strong, and unbreakable is the friendship between China and Bulgaria.
　　Everything we have seen with our own eyes during our visit to the People's Republic of China, and everything we have heard in our talks with the leaders of your country and the Chinese Communist Party, has made us even more fond of the cause of the great Chinese people and the rich culture built by the Chinese people over thousands of years with their wisdom and creativity.
　　Imperialists ruled in China for more than a hundred years. Like vampires, they infiltrated every corner of the Chinese economy, cruelly extracting the lifeblood of the Chinese land, and colluding with feudal reactionary forces and comprador bourgeoisie to plunder the fruits of the hard work of the disaster-ridden Chinese people. The Chinese people waged a long and heroic struggle against this oppression and powerlessness, and for national and social liberation.
　　The working people of Bulgaria have always held this great struggle with heartfelt admiration and sympathy. We admire your strength, fearlessness, incomparable bravery, and perseverance in fighting the enemy. We Bulgarian Communists and patriotic men and women have always firmly believed that despite the enormous difficulties, the Chinese people who are advancing on the road of great struggle will surely win. We have confidence because the struggle of the Chinese people is led by the glorious Chinese Communist Party, armed with the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism, far-sighted, closely linked to the people, and uniting the people for revolutionary truth and socialist solidarity. This confidence lies in the fact that the Chinese Communist Party is led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great son of the Chinese people, the famous leader—Leninist, beloved by the entire international communist and workers' movement.
　　We Bulgarian Communists and all the working people of our country are proud that our leader and teacher Georgi Dimitrov expressed the feelings of the entire Bulgarian people towards your struggle very well. In 1937, when China was in difficulty, G. Dimitrov said: The proletariat of the whole world is paying close attention to the Chinese incident. He repeatedly expressed sympathy for the fighting Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. He said, "However, when China is directly facing the danger of complete colonization, such general expressions of sympathy are not enough. It is necessary to give the Chinese people who are carrying out the liberation struggle warm love and genuine spiritual and political support. It is necessary to take active measures to influence all countries—especially the governments and public opinion of Britain, France, and the United States—to refuse all direct or indirect assistance to the aggression plans and actions of the Japanese warlords. It is necessary to continue to condemn the alliance between the Japanese fascist warlords and the German fascist warlords, condemning this alliance for the division and enslavement of China, and for a new imperialist world war. They are the most heinous conspiracies against peace, against culture, and against democracy." This is Dimitrov's enthusiastic call to the entire international revolutionary movement to support the ongoing Chinese people's revolution.
　　Georgi Dimitrov pointed out at the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party held in 1948 that the long, heroic, and tenacious struggle of the Chinese people against the imperialists and their reactionary running dogs is of particularly great significance for changing the proportion of progressive forces and international reactionary forces. Dimitrov was particularly pleased to point out at that time that the Chinese people are steadfastly approaching final victory.
　　Our people, who have been educated for decades by the Bulgarian Communist Party, Dimitar Blagoev and Georgi Dimitrov in the spirit of international solidarity and proletarian internationalism, welcomed the victory of the Chinese people and the founding of the People's Republic of China with extraordinary excitement and joy. The Bulgarian people regard the Chinese people's revolution as a great event that fundamentally changed the international balance of power in our modern times.
　　The fact that the People's Republic of Bulgaria established the closest friendly and diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on October 4, 1949, second only to the Soviet Union, is undeniable. There is no doubt that the victory of the People's Republic of China is the second major historical event after the great October Socialist Revolution. It has given a new impetus to the development of international revolutionary forces in the struggle waged by oppressed people and all mankind for peace and socialism.
　　Comrades!
　　In a few days, the Chinese people will celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. Eight years is a very short period, a moment in China's thousands of years of history. But in this short period, the Chinese people have taken a big step forward in development. The Chinese people, who have cast off the shackles of slavery and stood up, have widely demonstrated their creative power and are advancing rapidly on the road of socialism.
　　Thanks to the wise Marxist-Leninist policy of the Chinese Communist Party, profound social, economic, and cultural transformations have been completed in this vast country of China. With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Chinese people have achieved remarkable achievements in the socialist industrialization of the country. The socialist transformation of industry and commerce by turning private enterprises into joint state-private enterprises has attracted international attention. Land reform was carried out on a wide revolutionary scale. By learning from the experience of the Soviet Union and creatively applying this historical experience, the Chinese Communist Party has found a way to put agriculture on the socialist track in a short period of time. Comrades, there is no doubt that this is a great victory of the Chinese people's revolution. The large-scale socialist construction being carried out in your country today guarantees the successful solution of the task put forward by the Eighth Congress of the Party—that the People's Republic of China will gradually become a great socialist industrial country.
　　Based on our personal experience in socialist construction, we know that the Chinese people have to overcome many difficulties. These difficulties are the result of the heavy legacy that the people's government inherited from the past decadent feudal system and the status of an imperialist appendage. These are the difficulties in the great upsurge of the People's Republic of China steadily advancing on the road of socialism.
　　However, we have no doubt that the Chinese people will bravely overcome these difficulties under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The guarantee for overcoming difficulties is that the Chinese people are the sole and fully empowered masters of their own land and their own labor. The Chinese people have mastered their own destiny, and they are the creators of all happiness. The strength of the new China, the fraternal People's Republic of China, lies here.
　　Comrades!
　　The Chinese people, like the Bulgarian people, deeply realize that the unshakable unity between socialist countries is the main condition for our victorious advance. Both the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples have love and gratitude for our powerful friend and loyal ally—the great Soviet Union. We are proud that the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples stand firmly and unswervingly on the position of proletarian internationalism. Georgi Dimitrov, the great son of our country, said that the attitude towards the Soviet Union is the main criterion for measuring loyalty to the international communist movement and to proletarian internationalism. It is in this spirit that the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party constantly educate their own people.
　　Our two peoples have a great example in creative labor, which is the world-historical experience of the Soviet people. We have learned, are learning, and will continue to learn from this experience. It is undeniable that every country has its own characteristics and national traditions, and also its own difficulties. These cannot be ignored. But for our country, these characteristics and difficulties are not representative. What we should emphasize is not these, as the enemies of socialism do in order to pit our countries against each other and to split our countries. The main and representative thing that unites and unites the peoples of socialist countries in a friendly and strong family is our consistent goals and hopes, and that is our Marxist-Leninist ideology. Our ultimate goal—to completely eliminate the exploiting classes and to build a society without parasites and vampires, but only people of free labor—is more powerful than any characteristic.
　　Our two peoples, Bulgarian Communists and Chinese Communists, along with Communists and peoples of other countries, scorn the imperialist tune of "national communism," which is hostile to socialism and proletarian internationalism. We do not allow the enemy to hide under any disguise to smuggle their views of our party's ideology and policies. Our party and people regard it as their top priority to hold high the pure banner of Marxism-Leninism—the victory banner of the world's working people in the struggle for peace and socialism.
　　The growing unity and strength of our great socialist camp makes the imperialists extremely alarmed. Therefore, they will try with all their might and means now and in the future to alienate and split socialist countries, and to separate socialist countries from their powerful pillar—the Soviet Union. These attempts are destined to suffer inevitable demise. The Bulgarian people often call this situation "the hungry hen dreaming of millet." The imperialists vainly hope for the so-called collapse of the socialist camp. Recent events have proved that the unity of socialist countries has not weakened, but on the contrary, is becoming more and more consolidated and developed. Today, all the efforts of the people in our camp are converging together like a rushing river flowing into the ocean of socialism. Whoever tries to hinder or change this irresistible torrent will surely perish and will sink in the torrent of the invincible socialist camp.
　　Of course, we do not threaten anyone, nor do we make conspiracies against anyone. We have strived in the past and are striving now to coexist peacefully and cooperate peacefully with all countries with different social systems. We have strived in the past and are striving now to maintain and consolidate world peace.
　　Our friendly visit to the fraternal People's Republic of China is serving this great purpose. From this free platform in the capital of the world's most populous people, we declare once again that our two peoples do not want to harm anyone. We do not want to fight with the people of any country. We are willing to fight together with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries, as well as peace-loving people of all countries, to quickly resolve the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing by peaceful means, to ease international tensions, firmly consolidate peace, and for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.
　　But the imperialists are doing the opposite. On the one hand, under the pressure of world opinion, they have to say that they are willing to solve the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing positively. At the same time, they continue to expand their armaments and create new hotbeds of war. Obviously, this requires us to be vigilant, and we should not believe their empty words. When the representatives of the United States and certain Western countries turn the negotiations on disarmament issues into fruitless discussions, we cannot blindly believe their statements about peace. We cannot turn a blind eye to what the American imperialists are doing on the borders of China, Bulgaria, and other countries in the socialist camp. The US Seventh Fleet is cruising along the coast of mainland China, and the US Sixth Fleet is cruising in the Mediterranean Sea, and its detachments are near the Bulgarian border. We cannot remain indifferent when the United States is carrying out conspiracies to ignite war in the Middle East, and when the United States is trying to drag Turkey, which is adjacent to our country, into a war against Syria—a war that has extremely serious consequences for the Middle East and world peace.
　　We cannot believe in their myths of peace when the imperialists obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam, and when they support the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which no one can represent, and obstruct Taiwan's annexation into China. We cannot believe them because they stubbornly obstruct the People's Republic of China from occupying its legitimate position in the United Nations.
　　However, we firmly believe that despite the stubborn resistance of imperialists and enemies of socialism, the new China will surely win. A few years ago, the most reactionary forces in Western countries also stubbornly denied the right of little Bulgaria to become a member of the United Nations. The reactionaries in the United States were the most ferocious supporters of keeping Bulgaria out of the United Nations. But time has passed, and the people have spoken their minds. Our country was finally accepted into the United Nations.
　　We have reason to believe that no matter what, the great new China will get what it seeks. Standing on its side is an ever-growing powerful and invincible force. We Bulgarians unconditionally support the People's Republic of China in obtaining its legitimate position in the United Nations.
　　We are peace-loving countries, and we want to coexist peacefully with all countries, but if anyone dares to invade our country, we will use all our strength and means to defend our socialist achievements, to defend our freedom and national independence.
　　Dear Chinese Comrades and Friends,
　　Our visit to the People's Republic of China has just begun. The Government of the People's Republic of China has suggested that we visit the northeastern region of the People's Republic of China and then visit the southern region of China after we return from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We have accepted this suggestion. We will participate in your great National Day, on which the Chinese people will express their great enthusiasm and support for the Party and the government. We have no doubt that our delegation will receive the same warm and fraternal welcome everywhere as in Beijing, because the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples are forever linked by a deep and unbreakable friendship. No force can separate our two countries, and no force can weaken their friendship and solidarity.
　　We are pleased to point out that the conversations conducted so far between your government and party and us have demonstrated complete unanimity on all issues of the international situation, on the issue of the solidarity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and on the issue of further comprehensive political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the People's Republic of China.
　　We have no doubt that the conversations between the government delegations of our two countries will achieve good results, which will help to further consolidate our friendship, help to strengthen the solidarity of socialist countries, and will be a contribution to the struggle for consolidating peace and international cooperation.
　　Dear Chinese Comrades and Friends, I want to thank you once again for your warm and sincere hospitality. We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations on behalf of our delegation, the Bulgarian Communists, and the Bulgarian working people to the fraternal Chinese people for their continuous victories under the leadership of the heroic Communist Party on the difficult but glorious road to socialism, for their own happiness and the prosperity of their own socialist motherland.
　　Long live the working people of Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, the ancient city!
　　Long live the great Chinese people and the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the inspirer and organizer of the Chinese people's victory, and the Central Committee headed by Mao Zedong, the great son of the Chinese people!
　　Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between China and Bulgaria, and may our common friendship with the great Soviet Union be consolidated and prosper!
　　Long live the victory of international cooperation and world peace!

　　在北京各界欢迎保政府代表团大会上
　　彭真市长的欢迎词
　　敬爱的保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席于哥夫同志，
　　敬爱的保加利亚政府代表团的全体同志们，
　　同志们和朋友们：
    今天，北京市各界人民在这里举行大会，欢迎中国人民的亲密朋友，保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席于哥夫同志和保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团的全体同志们来我国访问，感到非常荣幸，非常高兴。首先，请允许我代表北京市的全体市民向于哥夫同志和代表团的全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    今年年初，我和我们全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团访问了保加利亚，并且和保加利亚各方面的领导同志进行了亲切的交谈。我们在保加利亚访问期间受到保加利亚人民和各方面领导同志们的热烈欢迎和兄弟般的接待。到处都感到保加利亚人民的伟大的国际主义精神和对中国人民的深厚友谊。我在这里再一次表示衷心的感谢。我们的代表团访问了保加利亚的一些重要城市，参观了许多工厂、发电站、水库、农业生产合作社、手工业生产合作社和高等学校等。我们亲眼看到勤劳勇敢的保加利亚人民，在保加利亚共产党和政府的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个方面所取得的巨大成就。今年是保加利亚第二个五年计划的最后一年，保加利亚人民正在满怀信心地为提前和超额完成计划而努力。这一计划的完成，将使保加利亚的国民经济和人民生活水平得到进一步的发展和提高。保加利亚的成就，也是我们所有社会主义国家的共同成就。我们为此感到无限的高兴。
    保加利亚是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营中坚强的一员。保加利亚人民在巩固社会主义各国的团结方面作出了许多贡献。在国际事务中，保加利亚坚持不渝地执行着和平的对外政策，并且为保卫欧洲和世界的和平进行了不懈的努力。中国人民完全支持保加利亚人民的这种努力，并且将继续同保加利亚人民共同奋斗，并肩前进。
    中保两国人民之间久已存在着深厚的友谊，保加利亚人民不朽的领袖、国际工人运动杰出的活动家季米特洛夫同志，是中国人民十分熟悉和敬仰的。他对中国人民的解放斗争，给了有力的支持和鼓舞；对中保两国人民友谊的建立，作出了不朽的贡献。近年来，我们两国在各方面的友好合作关系，获得了日益全面的发展。
    这种友谊是任何力量都不能够阻挠和破坏的。因为我们有伟大的马克思列宁主义作为我们共同的指导思想，有伟大的社会主义和共产主义事业作为我们共同的奋斗目标。
    现在，我们感到格外高兴的是，于哥夫同志已经是第二次来到我们的首都和我们的国家了。去年这个时候，于哥夫同志率领保加利亚共产党代表团参加了中国共产党的第八次全国代表大会，带来了保加利亚人民的兄弟友谊，给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。这次，于哥夫同志又率领保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团来我国进行友好访问。我们深信，这次访问一定会进一步加强我们两国人民的久已存在的深厚友谊，加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，并且有利于巩固世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业。
    敬爱的于哥夫同志和代表团的全体同志们，让我再一次代表北京市的各界人民对你们表示最热烈的欢迎，并且希望你们在访问中随时对我们工作中的缺点给予批评和指正。最后，请你们把北京市人民的无限热爱和敬意转达给兄弟的保加利亚人民。
    中保两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
　　于哥夫主席的讲话
　　亲爱的周恩来同志，
　　亲爱的彭真同志，
　　亲爱的中国同志们和朋友们，
　　伟大的中华人民共和国英雄首都的男女公民们！
    请允许我首先代表保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团，对我们作为保加利亚人民——格奥尔基·季米特洛夫的人民的代表的热情接待和你们的热烈欢迎，表示衷心的谢意。
    我们很荣幸地在今天盛大的群众大会上，代表保加利亚人民、保加利亚政府和保加利亚共产党中央委员会，向北京市的劳动人民转达最热烈的兄弟般的问候。
    我们来到你们的国家，是为了同你们一起再一次证明我们之间牢不可破的友谊和社会主义国家间不可摧毁的团结，是为了证明我们并肩勇敢前进，为社会主义事业、世界各国人民之间的和平与合作而斗争的决心。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团在中华人民共和国首都，古老的北京已经第三天了。这几天里我们曾经同你们城市的劳动人民见面，曾经有机会参观了一些企业和城市中的一些文化古迹，曾经同国家和党的领导人进行了谈话。我们现在有机会在这个盛大的群众大会上直接地、面对面地同你们，亲爱的中国同志们和朋友们见面，从你们欢笑的脸上，从你们兴奋的心情中我们更加强烈地感觉到，中国人民对自己忠实的朋友和兄弟，保加利亚人民的挚爱之情是多么深厚，保中友谊又是多么深厚，强大，牢不可破。
    在中华人民共和国访问的日子里，我们亲眼看到的一切，我们在同你们国家和中国共产党领导人谈话中所听到的一切，都使我们对于伟大中国人民的事业，对中国人民几千年来以自己的智慧和创造建立起来的丰富的文化更加热爱。
    帝国主义者在中国统治了一百多年。他们像吸血鬼一样，渗入到中国经济的每一个角落，他们残酷地吸取了中国土地的生命汁泽，同封建反动势力和买办资产阶级联成一气，劫夺灾难深重的中国人民的辛勤劳动的成果。中国人民为反对这种压迫和无权地位，为争取民族和社会的解放进行了长期英勇的斗争。
    保加利亚劳动人民对于这一伟大的斗争一直怀着衷心钦佩和同情的心情。我们钦佩你们在同敌人作战时的坚强、无畏、无比勇敢的精神和毅力。我们保加利亚共产党人和男女爱国者一向深信，尽管有巨大的困难，但在伟大斗争的道路上前进的中国人民一定会胜利。我们有信心，因为领导中国人民斗争的是以马克思列宁主义的革命理论武装起来的、有远见的、密切联系人民并且为革命真理和社会主义团结人民的光荣的中国共产党。这个信心在于，中国共产党是由中国人民伟大的儿子，著名的领导者——列宁主义者，整个国际共产主义和工人运动所热爱的毛泽东同志所领导的。
    我们保加利亚共产党人和我国一切劳动人民，由于我们的领袖和导师格奥尔基·季米特洛夫很好地表达了保加利亚全国人民对于你们斗争的感情而感到自豪。1937年，当中国正处在困难的时候，格·季米特洛夫说：全世界无产阶级都非常注意中国事变。他再三地表示对于奋斗中的中国人民和中国共产党的同情。他说“但是，当中国直接受到完全殖民地化危险的时候，这样一般的表示同情是不够的。必须对正在进行解放斗争的中国人民予以亲热的爱护和真正的精神上、政治上的拥护。必须采取积极的方法来影响各国——首先是英国、法国、美国政府和社会舆论，使他们拒绝一切直接或间接对于日本军阀侵略计划和行动的帮助。必须继续不断地谴责日本法西斯军阀同德国法西斯军阀结成同盟，谴责这种为分割和奴役中国，以及进行新的帝国主义世界大战的同盟，它们是反对和平、反对文化和反对民主的最可恶的阴谋。”这是季米特洛夫对整个国际革命运动发出的支持正在开展的中国人民的革命的热情号召。
    格奥尔基·季米特洛夫在1948年举行的保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会上指出，中国人民反对帝国主义者和他们的反动走狗的长期英勇顽强的斗争对改变进步力量和国际反动势力的比例，具有特别重大的意义。季米特洛夫当时特别高兴地指出，中国人民正在坚定不移地接近最后的胜利。
    我国人民几十年来在保加利亚共产党、迪米特尔·布拉戈耶夫和格奥尔基·季米特洛夫的国际团结和无产阶级国际主义的精神教育下，以异常兴奋和喜悦的心情迎接了中国人民的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立。保加利亚人民把中国人民的革命看作我们现代根本改变国际力量对比的伟大事件。
    保加利亚人民共和国在1949年10月4日，仅次于苏联，就同中华人民共和国建立了最密切的友好和外交关系的事实，是无可争辩的。毫无疑问，中华人民共和国的胜利是在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后的第二个重大的历史事件。它在被压迫的人民和全人类为和平和社会主义而进行的斗争中，给予国际革命力量的发展以新的推动力量。
    同志们！
    几天以后中国人民就要庆祝人民共和国成立八周年了。八年是一个非常短暂的时期，是中国几千年历史上的一刹那。但是就在这短短的期间，中国人民在发展中跃进了一大步。抛掉了奴役的羁绊而站立起来的中国人民，广泛地展示了自己的创造性的力量，不可抑制地在社会主义的道路上飞快前进。
    由于中国共产党英明的马克思列宁主义的政策，在中国这个巨大的国家里完成了深刻的社会、经济和文化的改造。在苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的援助下，中国人民在国家社会主义工业化方面，获得了卓越的成就。将私营企业变为公私合营企业的工商业的社会主义改造，引起了国际上的注意。以广泛的革命规模进行了土地改革。由于学习了苏联的经验和创造性地运用了这种历史经验，中国共产党找到了足以使农业在短期间内走上社会主义轨道的方式。同志们，无疑的，这是中国人民革命的巨大胜利。今天在你们国家里进行着的大规模的社会主义建设保证了党第八次代表大会所提出的任务——中华人民共和国逐步地变为伟大的社会主义工业国——得以顺利解决。
    根据我们在社会主义建设中的亲身体验，我们知道，中国人民要克服许多困难。这些困难是人民政权从过去的腐朽的封建制度和帝国主义附庸地位承受的沉重遗产的结果。这些是中华人民共和国在社会主义道路上稳步前进中的，伟大高涨中的困难。
    然而我们毫不怀疑，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下一定会勇敢地克服这些困难。克服困难的保证就是：中国人民是自己土地和自己劳动的唯一的全权的主人。中国人民掌握了自己的命运，它是一切幸福的创造者。新的中国，兄弟的中华人民共和国的力量，也就在于这里。
    同志们！
    中国人民正如保加利亚人民一样，深刻地认识到，社会主义国家之间的不可动摇的团结是我们胜利前进的主要条件。保加利亚人民和中国人民都对我们强大的朋友和忠实的同盟者——伟大的苏联，怀着热爱和感激的心情。我们为保加利亚人民和中国人民坚定地、毫不动摇地站在无产阶级国际主义的立场上而感到自豪。我国人民的伟大的儿子格奥尔基·季米特洛夫说过，对待苏联的态度是衡量对国际共产主义运动、对无产阶级国际主义的忠诚的主要准则，保加利亚共产党和中国共产党正是以这种精神不断地教育自己的人民。
    我们两国人民在创造性的劳动中有着伟大的榜样，这就是苏联人民的具有世界历史意义的经验。我们过去、现在和将来都学习这种经验。无可争辩的，每一个国家都有自己的特点和民族传统，也有他们自己的困难。这些都是不能忽视的。但是对我们国家来说，这些特点和困难并不是具有代表性的，我们应强调的不是这些，像社会主义的敌人为了使我们国家互相对立，为了分裂我们的国家所作的那样。把社会主义各国人民联合和团结在友好和强大的大家庭中的主要的、具有代表性的东西就是我们一致的目标和希望，就是我们的马克思列宁主义思想。我们的最终目的——彻底消灭剥削阶级和建成没有寄生虫和吸血鬼，而只有自由劳动的人民的社会，是比任何特征更有力的。
    我们两国人民，保加利亚共产党人和中国共产党人，同其他各国的共产党人和人民在一起唾弃“民族共产主义”这个与社会主义和无产阶级国际主义敌对的帝国主义论调。我们不允许敌人躲藏在任何伪装下偷运他们对于我们党的思想和政策的观点。我们的党和人民把高举纯洁的马克思列宁主义旗帜——世界劳动人民争取和平和社会主义斗争中的胜利旗帜，看作他们的头等重要的义务。
    我们伟大的社会主义阵营日益增长的团结和强大，使帝国主义者感到极端惊慌。因此它们现在和将来都会企图用一切力量和手段来离间和分裂社会主义国家，使社会主义国家脱离它们强大的支柱——苏联。这些企图都注定要遭到必然的复亡。保加利亚人民常把这种情况叫做“饿母鸡梦着小米”。帝国主义者枉费心机地希望所谓社会主义阵营的崩溃。最近的事件证明，社会主义国家的团结不但没有削弱，而相反地越来越巩固和发展。今天，我们阵营中人民的一切努力聚汇在一起就像澎湃奔腾的河流注入社会主义的海洋。谁企图阻挠或改变这个不可遏止的洪流，就一定会灭亡，并将沉没在无敌的社会主义阵营的洪流里。
    当然，我们不威胁任何人，也不制造阴谋来反对任何人。我们过去和现在都努力同一切不同社会制度的国家和平共处和和平合作，我们过去和现在都努力于维护和巩固世界和平。
    现在我们到兄弟的中华人民共和国进行友好访问正是为了这个伟大的目的服务的。我们从世界上人口最多的人民的首都的这个自由讲坛上，再一次声明，我们两国人民不想损害任何人。我们不愿意同任何国家的人民作战。我们愿同苏联、中华人民共和国和所有的社会主义国家，以及爱好和平的各国人民一起，为迅速地以和平方法解决裁军，禁止试验核武器的问题，缓和国际紧张局势，坚决巩固和平，为不同社会制度国家间的和平共处而斗争。
    但是帝国主义所做的正与这些相反。一方面他们在世界舆论的压力下，不得不说他们愿意正面解决裁军和禁止试验核武器的问题，同时，他们却继续扩充军备，制造新战争的温床。很明显，这就需要我们警惕，我们不要相信他们的空话。当美国和某些西方国家的代表把关于裁军问题的谈判变为毫无结果的讨论的时候，我们不能盲目相信他们的关于和平的声明。我们对于美国帝国主义者在中国、保加利亚和社会主义阵营其它国家的边境所做的事情不能闭眼不看，美国第七舰队正在中国大陆的沿海巡弋，美国第六舰队正在地中海巡弋，而它的分队处在保加利亚边境附近。当美国在中近东进行燃起战火的阴谋的时候，当美国企图把同我国毗邻的土耳其拖入反对叙利亚的战争——这场战争对中近东和世界和平有着极其严重的后果——的时候，我们不能无动于衷。
    当帝国主义者阻挠朝鲜和越南和平统一的时候，当他们支持谁也不能代表的蒋介石集团，阻挠台湾归并中国的时候，我们不能够相信他们的爱好和平的神话。我们所以不能相信他们，是因为他们极其顽固地阻挠中华人民共和国占据它在联合国中的合法地位。
    然而我们深信，尽管帝国主义者和社会主义的敌人进行顽抗，新中国一定胜利。几年以前西方国家最反动的阶层
  也曾经顽强地否认小小的保加利亚成为联合国成员国的权利。美国的反动分子是主张把保加利亚摒除于联合国组织之外的最凶恶的支持者。但是，时间过去了，人民道出了自己的意见。我国终于被接纳参加联合国。
    我们有理由相信，无论怎样，伟大的新中国将得到它所追求的东西。站在它一边的是不断增长着的强大的、不可战胜的力量。我们保加利亚人，无条件地支持中华人民共和国获得它在联合国中的合法地位。
    我们是爱好和平的国家，我们要同一切国家和平共处，但是假如有人敢于侵犯我们的国家，我们就用一切力量和方法一致来保卫我们社会主义的成果，来保卫我们的自由和民族独立。
    亲爱的中国同志们和朋友们，
    我们在中华人民共和国的访问刚刚开始。中华人民共和国政府建议我们访问中华人民共和国的东北地区，等我们从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国回来后再访问中国南部地区，我们接受了这个建议。我们将要参加你们伟大的国庆节，在这一天，中国人民将要表达自己对党和政府的巨大热情和拥护。我们毫不怀疑，我们代表团在各地将受到同北京一样热烈和兄弟般的欢迎，因为保加利亚人民和中国人民是以深厚而牢不可破的友谊永远联系着的，没有任何力量能够把我们两国分开，没有任何力量能够削弱它们的友爱和团结。
    我们高兴地指出，到现在为止在你们政府和党同我们之间进行的交谈，在国际局势的一切问题上，在以苏联为首的社会主义各国团结的问题上，在保加利亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国进一步的全面的政治、经济和文化合作问题上表现了完全的一致。
    我们毫不怀疑，我们两国政府代表团之间的交谈将获得良好的结果，将有助于进一步巩固我们的友谊，有助于社会主义各国的团结，将是对争取巩固和平和国际合作斗争的贡献。
    亲爱的中国同志们和朋友们，我要再一次感谢你们热情和真挚的招待。我们谨代表我们代表团，保加利亚共产党人和保加利亚劳动人民衷心地祝贺兄弟的中国人民在英勇的共产党的领导下，在走向社会主义的困难然而光荣的道路上，为了自己的幸福和自己社会主义祖国的繁荣获得连续不断的胜利。
    中华人民共和国首都，古老的北京的劳动人民万岁！
    伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民胜利的鼓舞者和组织者中国共产党和以中国人民伟大的儿子毛泽东为首的中央委员会万岁！
    伟大的和牢不可破的保中友谊及我们与伟大苏联的共同友谊、巩固和繁荣万岁！
    国际合作和世界和平事业的胜利万岁！
