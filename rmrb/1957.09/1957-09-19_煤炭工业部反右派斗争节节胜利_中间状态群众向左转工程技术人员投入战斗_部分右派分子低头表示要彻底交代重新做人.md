　　The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Coal Industry is developing in depth. Of the masses who were in a middle state in the early stages of the anti-Rightist movement, about 60%, the vast majority have now turned to the left, and senior engineering and technical personnel have also actively participated in the struggle by reasoning.

　　Since August 30, the ministry has held successive debate meetings for engineering and technical personnel to criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of Wang Fuxian, a fourth-level engineer in the Production Department and a rightist element.

　　When criticizing Wang Fuxian's fallacy that "the Communist Party cannot lead technology," Wang Zhujia, chief engineer of the Coal Mine Geological Bureau and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said excitedly: In the old China, less than 300 geological personnel were trained in 33 years, and most of them were at the end of their ropes and had no means of livelihood, forcing some to switch to teaching, some to become bank accountants, and some to go down the mine to dig coal, while those who were lucky enough to work in geology were only a hundred. In the old China, there were no specialized coal mine geological institutions or drilling teams at all, and geological research was even more pitiful. The "Central Geological Survey" and "Nanjing Geological Institute" at that time had only a few dozen staff members and only a few microscopes as equipment. But what about after liberation? There are currently 10,000 students in geological departments of universities and colleges across the country. In the past few years, 5,000 people have graduated and taken up work. In terms of geological technology, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, we have mastered the complete set of exploration technology from general survey to detailed survey. Now, we have fifty-one comprehensive exploration teams, which can complete 1.3 million meters of drilling annually, submit more than 100 geological reports, and obtain 5 billion tons of refined coal reserves. He questioned Wang Fuxian: Which is better, the old or the new society? Can the Communist Party lead science and technology? Can a fair conclusion be drawn from these facts?

　　Engineer Wang Yifan, in criticizing Wang Fuxian for maliciously provoking the relationship between the Party and technical personnel and slandering that "the Party does not trust technical personnel, and having a position and power is just a slogan," pointed out: Since 1955, the coal industry system has established a chief engineer system and a technical responsibility system at all levels of management agencies. The technical departments within the ministry have engineers responsible for handling technical issues. All major technical issues have always been discussed and concluded by technical personnel. Taking Wang Fuxian himself as an example, in 1953, he was transferred from Fushun to the Beijing Coal Mine Administration Bureau as the head of the coal preparation section, and later promoted to fourth-level engineer. He participated in ministerial meetings, and many of his opinions were adopted on coal preparation technology issues. Wang Fuxian insisted that the Party does not trust technical personnel. Isn't this a sinister lie!

　　Under the condemnation of the broad masses, rightist elements in other units of the ministry also collapsed in a panic.

　　For example, Guo Zhongyuan, a rightist element from the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute, openly put forward a complete set of organizational plans to abolish the Party's leadership over science and technology, attempting to change the direction of socialist construction. At the institute-wide debate meeting, engineer Jiang Hongxun refuted him: Before liberation, there was not a single coal mine design institute in the country, and not a single modern mine was designed by Chinese themselves. But since liberation, they have grown from nothing, from small to large, and now there are already nine coal mine design institutes. Taking the Beijing Institute as an example, it has completed the complete design of sixty pairs of mines, developing from small and medium-sized mine design to the ability to design large mines with an annual output of 2.4 million to 4 million tons, and is currently preparing to start hydraulic mining design. These achievements are all the result of the Party's leadership. Abolishing the Party's leadership would be to ruin the future of socialist construction.

　　For example, Liu Bin, a rightist element from the washing (coal) and selection (coal) design institute who slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and Wu Yong'an and Yang Taisheng, rightist elements from the Beijing Design Institute who slandered and attacked activists, were all severely criticized by the masses and completely isolated.

　　Now, many of these rightist elements have lowered their heads, admitted defeat and mistake, and expressed to the masses their willingness to make a thorough confession and start anew.

　　煤炭工业部反右派斗争节节胜利
　　中间状态群众向左转工程技术人员投入战斗
　　部分右派分子低头表示要彻底交代重新做人
    本报讯　煤炭工业部反右派斗争向深入发展。在反右派初期，约有60％左右处于中间状态的群众，目前绝大多数已经向左转，高级工程技术人员也都积极地参加了说理斗争。
    该部自8月30日起，连续召开了工程技术人员的辩论大会，批判生产司四级工程师、右派分子王复先的反党反社会主义的谬论。
    在批判王复先的“共产党不能领导技术”的谬论时，煤矿地质总局总工程师、中国科学院学部委员王竹家激动地说：旧中国三十三年培养的地质人员不足三百人，而且大部分走头无路，生活无着，逼得有的人转业教书，有的人当银行会计，有的人下井挖煤，而幸运能作地质工作的只不过百人。旧中国根本没有专门的煤矿地质机构和钻探队伍，地质研究工作更是可怜，那时的“中央地质调查所”和“南京地质研究所”，工作人员不过几十人，设备不过是几台显微镜而已。而解放后怎样呢？全国现有大专地质系的学生达一万人。几年来毕业后走上工作岗位的已有五千人。在地质技术上，由于苏联专家的帮助，我们已经掌握了从普查到精查整套的勘探技术。现在，我们已经有五十一个综合勘探队，每年可以完成一百三十万公尺的钻探量，提出百余件地质报告，获得五十亿吨精煤储量。他质问王复先：新旧社会孰优孰劣，共产党能不能领导科学技术，从这些事实中还得不出公正的结论吗？
    王逸凡工程师在批判王复先恶毒地挑拨党和技术人员的关系，诬蔑“党不信任技术人员，有职有权只是一种口号”时指出：自1955年开始，煤炭工业系统建立了各级管理机构的总工程师制和技术责任制，部内各技术部门都有工程师负责处理技术问题，凡研究或决定重大技术问题，一向都是经过技术人员讨论而作出结论的。以王复先本人来说，1953年由抚顺调到北京煤矿管理总局当选煤科长，以后又提升为四级工程师，他参加过部务会议，有关选煤技术问题，不少是采纳了他的意见，而王复先硬说党不信任技术人员，这岂不是别有用心的鬼话！
    在广大群众的声讨下，该部其他单位的右派分子也都纷纷狼狈溃败。
    如北京煤矿设计院的右派分子郭中元，公然提出了一整套取消党领导科学技术的组织方案，企图以此来改变社会主义建设的方向。在全院辩论大会上，蒋洪巽工程师驳斥他说：解放以前，国内没有一个煤矿设计院，也没有一个现代化的矿井是中国人自己设计的。但解放以来却从无到有，从小到大，现在已经有了九个煤矿设计院。其中以北京院为例，已经完成了六十对矿井的全套设计，从中小型矿井设计发展到可以设计年产二百四十到四百万吨的大型矿井，目前还正在准备开始水力采煤的设计。这些成绩都是党领导的结果，取消党的领导，就是断送社会主义建设的前途。
    又如诬蔑肃反运动的洗（煤）选（煤）设计院右派分子刘斌，北京设计院的诬蔑和攻击积极分子的右派分子吴永安、杨泰生等，都遭到了群众的痛斥，而完全孤立。
    现在，这些右派分子当中，有不少人已经低下头来，服输认错，并向群众表示愿作彻底交代，重新作人。
