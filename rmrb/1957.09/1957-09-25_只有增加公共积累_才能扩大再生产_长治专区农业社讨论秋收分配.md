Xinhua News Agency, Changzhi, September 23rd: The Changzhi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has requested that all agricultural cooperatives pay special attention to resolving the issue of public accumulation during the autumn harvest distribution, in order to have more funds available for expanded reproduction next year.

Of the more than four thousand agricultural cooperatives in the Changzhi Special District, some cooperatives in the past neglected public accumulation. These cooperatives not only accumulated little, but also failed to use the funds in a centralized manner or used them improperly. For example, the Fengcun Sino-Soviet Agricultural Cooperative in Luan County only accumulated more than 2,000 yuan last year (accounting for 6% of the total income), and this money was used to purchase many mimeograph machines, small plows, and other items that were not urgently needed for current production.

According to the District Committee's investigation, the total income of 78% of the agricultural cooperatives in the district increased this year compared to last year. In view of this situation, the Changzhi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has requested that all agricultural cooperatives pay attention to increasing public accumulation without affecting the income of cooperative members. For agricultural cooperatives with particularly significant income increases, public accumulation funds and public welfare funds are required to accumulate about 10%, with a maximum of no more than 12%; general production increase cooperatives accumulate 8% to 10%; cooperatives that do not increase production compared to last year, or increase production by a small amount, accumulate about 8%. In order to avoid improper use of funds, the District Committee also requires all agricultural cooperatives to properly arrange next year's investment plan for expanding reproduction according to the principle of prioritizing urgent needs; at the same time, it requires agricultural cooperatives to appropriately use public welfare funds.

Many agricultural cooperatives are already discussing this issue. The cooperative members realize that if they want to expand production and increase income, they must appropriately increase public accumulation. Each cooperative has also examined the experience and lessons of past accumulation and use of funds, and is formulating specific plans for this year's public accumulation.

### 只有增加公共积累　才能扩大再生产  长治专区农业社讨论秋收分配

    只有增加公共积累　才能扩大再生产
    长治专区农业社讨论秋收分配
    新华社长治23日电　中共长治地委要求各农业社秋收分配中特别注意解决公共积累问题，以便明年有更多的资金用于扩大再生产。
    长治专区四千多个农业社中，过去有一部分社忽视公共积累。这些社不仅积累得少，而且资金没有集中使用或者使用不当。例如潞安县冯村中苏农业社，去年只积累资金两千多元（占总收入的6％），这些钱还拿去购买了许多当前生产并不急需的油印机，小土犁等等。
    根据地委调查，今年全区有占78％的农业社总收入比去年增加。鉴于这种情况，中共长治地委要求各农业社在不影响社员收入的情况下，注意增加公共积累。对于增收特别显著的农业社，公积金和公益金要求积累10％左右，最高不超过12％；一般增产社积累8％到10％；不比去年增产，或增产不多的社积累8％左右。为避免资金使用不当，地委还要求各个农业社根据轻重缓急的原则妥善安排明年扩大再生产的投资计划；同时要求农业社适当使用公益金。
    现在许多农业社已经对这个问题进行讨论。社员们认识到要想扩大生产，增加收入，就要适当地增加公共积累。各社还检查了过去积累和使用资金的经验教训，正在制定今年公共积累的具体计划。
