Promote Rice Bran Oil Extraction
Zhou Shangda

The use of rice bran to extract oil has a history of twenty years in China. In 1937, Taiwan first saw the emergence of rice bran oil extraction factories. After 1953, cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Wuxi, Wuzhou also began to extract rice bran oil.

Extracting oil from rice bran has immense economic value.

According to China's First Five-Year Plan targets, the national rice production in 1957 could reach more than 80 million tons, yielding approximately 5 million tons of rice bran. If all of this is used for oil extraction and then as feed, it could extract 500,000 to 650,000 tons of rice bran oil, equivalent to the oil yield from over 88 million mu of soybeans. Based on China's current edible oil consumption levels, this could supply the entire nation's 600 million people for five to six months. If using the extraction method, 900,000 to 950,000 tons of rice bran oil can be produced, which can supply the entire nation's 600 million people for eight to nine months, with a value of 400 million to 520 million yuan. Last year, Shanghai's oil factories extracted 3,400 tons of rice bran oil.

Of course, collecting all the rice bran scattered in the countryside for oil extraction will have difficulties; at the same time, it will not be possible to extract all the rice bran in some areas where production equipment is insufficient. However, the amount of rice processed in cities under state control is considerable, and cities do not lack feed, so it can all be used for oil extraction. It is estimated that all cities in the country have a total of 1.3 million tons of rice bran, which can produce 150,000 to 180,000 tons of rice bran oil, which can supply 75 million to 90 million people for a year, with a value of 120 million to 140 million yuan. If it is all used to make soap, it can produce 290,000 to 350,000 tons. This will not only solve the current problem of insufficient oil supply for the soap industry, but also transfer approximately 80,000 tons of edible oil originally supplied to the soap industry for consumption.

Will extracting oil from rice bran affect pig feeding?

According to experiments in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Tianjin, and other places, it has been proven that there is no impact.

First, pigs do not need excessive fat in their feed.

According to the research of Soviet animal husbandry expert I.S. Popov, although fat is of great significance to livestock, the required amount is extremely low. In the early stages of livestock growth, each kilogram of body weight requires 5 to 15 grams of fat per day, and only 0.3 to 0.5 grams in the later stages of development. If a pig weighing 100 jin is fed 5 jin of bran cake and 5 jin of green fodder every day, the fat content will be 225 grams, which is 9 to 15 times the pig's requirement. If the same weight of rice bran is fed, the fat content is over 500 grams (1 jin), which is more than 30 times the fat content required in the pig's diet. Actual pig feeding experiments have proved that excessive fat in pig feed is not only unhelpful to the pig's nutrition and fattening, but also harmful. The Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Bureau's livestock farm uses oil-extracted rice bran cake to feed pigs, and each pig gains an average of one jin of live weight per day, and the meat is fat and thick, and the meat quality exceeds that of pigs eating rice bran. This livestock farm sold fifteen pigs eating bran cake to the Shanghai Food Company, and they were all rated as the best price. However, when feeding rice bran in the same way, not only was the weight gain less (each pig increased weight by 0.77 to 0.79 jin per day), but more than 40% of the pigs suffered from indigestion.

Second, fat growth is not caused by eating more "oil."

Plant fat is converted from carbohydrates, and animal fat can also be converted from carbohydrates and proteins. Nutritionists Lawes and Gilbert once selected several piglets born from the same litter and fed them with fat, carbohydrates, and protein, respectively. After a period of time, they were slaughtered and analyzed. The result was that the piglets fed with carbohydrates produced more fat than those fed with fat or protein.

Actual pig feeding experiments in our country have also proved that livestock eating too much fat cannot generate more animal fat. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute uses rice bran to feed pigs. Each pig eats one jin of plant fat, about two jin of carbohydrates, and about 1.2 jin of protein, as well as other nutrients, every day, and can gain an average of a little more than one jin of live weight per day. The Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Bureau's livestock farm uses bran cake to feed pigs. Each pig eats 6.8 liang of plant fat and an appropriate amount of carbohydrates and proteins every day, and each pig also gains one jin of live weight per day.

Perhaps some people will ask that the proportion of rice bran in the current pig feed is not large, and the proportion of wild vegetables and green fodder is larger. If oil-extracted rice bran is used to feed pigs, it will definitely affect the growth and fattening of pigs. This question sounds very reasonable at first glance, but after careful analysis and research, this statement still lacks scientific basis. Because wild vegetables and other green fodder contain a lot of fat, for example, potato seedlings contain 5.6% fat (exceeding the fat contained in wheat bran and bean dregs), sweet potato seedlings contain 3.39% fat, peanut seedlings contain 2.78% fat, sorghum leaves contain 5.2% fat, sunflower seed discs contain 4.51% fat, aquatic plants contain 2.8% fat, three-edged grass contains 3.5% fat, and alkali grass contains 3.6% fat. Therefore, if wild grass is not used well to feed pigs, it is not because of the lack of fat, but because the content of protein and starch is not enough. The pig feed of the Shimen Song Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, which is famous throughout the country for raising the most pigs, is made of green grass, silage, and various leaves such as cotton, peanuts, soybeans, mung beans, sunflowers, poplar trees, and willow trees.

Before liberation, landlords in many areas of the South used rice to feed pigs, and the pigs were fed fat and strong. However, the fat content of rice is only about 3%, which is more than half less than the fat content in rice bran cake. It is very clear that the key problem of feeding pigs poorly now is not "insufficient fat", but insufficient starch and protein. Therefore, researching how to supplement the lack of starch and protein in feed, and how to obtain reasonable and economical feed, is the primary problem that agricultural and animal husbandry departments urgently need to study and solve.

Finally, there is another benefit of extracting oil from rice bran and then feeding it to pigs. Rice bran contains lipase, and if it is not treated in time, the rice bran is extremely prone to spoilage, giving off a sour and rancid moldy smell. Pigs do not like to eat it, it can no longer be used as feed, and the quantity will be reduced by more than 10%. If the fresh rice bran is squeezed out of oil and heated to destroy the lipase and stop it from producing free fat, then, not only can it increase oil production, reduce the intangible losses suffered by rice bran during storage, improve the quality of rice bran, making it easy to store and not prone to spoilage due to commercial circulation links; but also in the process of oil extraction, because the rice bran is heated and steamed, it can remove the moldy odor and soften the crude fiber, making it easier for livestock to eat and digest, which is beneficial to the fattening and growth of piglets.

At present, there are still some specific problems and difficulties in promoting rice bran oil extraction. For example, some areas still lack oil extraction equipment; some agricultural cooperatives report that it is too laborious to crush the bran cake and hope that the oil factory will crush it, these problems still need to be studied and gradually resolved.

    推广米糠榨油
    周上达
    利用米糠榨油，在我国已有二十年的历史。1937年台湾首先出现米糠榨油工厂。1953年以后，上海、天津、武汉、广州、无锡、梧州等城市也先后开始榨米糠油。
    用米糠榨油，有极大的经济价值。
    按照我国第一个五年计划指标，1957年全国稻谷产量可达八千多万吨，约可产米糠五百万吨。如全部榨油以后再作饲料，可提取米糠油五十到六十五万吨，约等于八千余万亩大豆的产油量，按我国目前食油消费水平计算，可供全国六亿人吃五到六个月。如果用萃取法，可制取米糠油九十到九十五万吨，可供全国六亿人吃八到九个月，价值四亿到五亿二千万元。上海油脂工厂去年就榨出了三千四百吨米糠油。
    当然，要将分散在农村中的米糠全部收集起来榨油，是有困难的；同时在某些生产设备不足的地区也不可能将全部米糠榨完。但是，由国家掌握在城市加工的稻谷为数不少，而且城市不缺饲料，可以全部用来榨油。据估计，全国各城市共有米糠一百三十万吨，能制取米糠油十五到十八万吨，可供七千五百到九千万人口吃一年，价值一亿二千到一亿四千万元。如果全部用来制造肥皂，可以做二十九到三十五万吨。这样，不但可以解决目前肥皂工业用油供应不足的问题，而且还可以将原来供应肥皂工业用的食用油约八万吨转而供应食用。
    米糠榨掉了油，会不会影响喂猪呢？
    根据上海、江苏、浙江、广西、天津等地的试验，证明是没有影响的。
    第一、猪的饲料中不需要过多的脂肪。
    根据苏联畜牧学家伊·斯·波波夫的研究，认为脂肪对家畜虽然有重要的意义，但需要量极为低微，在家畜的生长初期，每公斤体重每日需要脂肪五到十五克，到发育后期只需要零点三到零点五克。如果一头体重一百斤的猪，每天喂五斤糠饼和五斤青饲料的话，则其中脂肪含量就有二百二十五克，等于猪的需要量的九到十五倍。如喂同样重量的米糠，其中脂肪含量在五百克（一市斤）以上，相当于猪食中需要的脂肪含量三十倍以上。根据实际喂猪试验证明，猪吃了过多的脂肪，对猪的营养肥育不但无益，反而有害。上海市农业局种畜场用榨过油的米糠饼喂猪，每头猪每天平均增加毛重一斤，而且膘肥肉厚，肉质超过吃米糠的猪。这个种畜场把十五头吃糠饼的猪卖给上海市食品公司，都被评为最优价格。但用同样方法喂米糠时，不但增重较少（每头猪每天增加重量为零点七七到零点七九斤），且有40％以上的猪得了消化不良的病。
    第二、脂肪的生长并不是因为多吃了“油”。
    植物脂肪是由碳水化合物变成的，动物脂肪同样能由碳水化合物、蛋白质转变而成。营养学家拉威斯和契尔伯特曾选择几头同胎所生的小猪，分别饲以脂肪、碳水化合物、蛋白质等饲料，过了一个时期后，宰杀分析，结果是喂碳水化合物的小猪比喂脂肪或蛋白质的小猪生成的脂肪多。
    在我国的实际喂猪试验中也证明了牲畜吃了过多的脂肪，并不能生成更多的动物脂肪。华北农业科学研究所用米糠喂猪，每头猪每天吃入植物脂肪一市斤，碳水化合物约二市斤，蛋白质约一点二市斤，还有其他养料，每天平均可以长毛重一市斤多一点。而上海市农业局种畜场用糠饼喂猪，每头猪每天吃入植物脂肪六点八市两，和适量的碳水化合物蛋白质等，每头猪每天也长毛重一市斤。
    也许有人要问问现在喂猪的饲料中，米糠所占比重不多，而野菜青饲料所占比重较大，如果用榨过油的米糠来喂猪，一定会影响猪的成长肥育。这个问题骤然一听很有道理，但是仔细地分析研究一下，这种说法还是缺乏科学依据的。因为野菜等青饲料中所含的脂肪是不少的，例如马铃秧含脂肪为5.6％（超过小麦麸皮和豆渣所含的脂肪），甘薯秧含脂肪量为3.39％，花生秧为2.78％，高粱叶为5.2％，葵花子盘为4.51％，水草为2.8％，三棱草为3.5％，芨芨草为3.6％。因此，用野草喂猪喂得不好，并不是因为脂肪少，而是蛋白质和淀粉的含量不够。以养猪最多而闻名于全国的山东省阳谷县石门宋乡农业生产合作社的喂猪饲料，就是用青草、青贮饲料和棉花、花生、黄豆、绿豆、向日葵、杨树、柳树等各种各样的叶子喂的。
    解放前南方不少地区的地主是用稻米喂猪的，把猪喂得又肥又壮。但是稻米所含脂肪量也只有3％左右，比米糠饼中的脂肪含量少一倍以上。这就很显然，现在喂猪喂得不好的关键问题，并不是“脂肪不够”，而是淀粉和蛋白质不足。因此，研究如何补足饲料中的淀粉和蛋白质的不足，如何能得到既合理又经济的饲料，是当前农业畜牧部门亟待研究解决的首要问题。
    最后，米糠榨掉油再喂猪，还有一个好处。米糠里含有解脂酵素，如不及时处理，米糠极易变质，发出酸败霉味，猪不爱吃，不能再作饲料，而且数量要减少一成以上。如果把新鲜米糠榨掉油，经过加热，破坏了解脂酵素，停止它产生游离脂肪后，那么，不仅可以增产油脂，减少米糠在贮藏期间遭到的无形损失，提高米糠的质量，使它容易保管，不致因经过商业流转环节而变质；而且在榨油过程中，因为米糠经过加热蒸煮，可以除去霉变气味和使粗纤维软化，牲畜爱吃，容易消化，有利于猪仔肥育成长。
    目前，在推广米糠榨油工作中，还存在着一些具体问题和困难。比如，有些地区还缺乏榨油设备；有的农业社反映糠饼破碎起来太费工，希望改由油厂破碎，这些问题还需要进行研究，逐步解决。
