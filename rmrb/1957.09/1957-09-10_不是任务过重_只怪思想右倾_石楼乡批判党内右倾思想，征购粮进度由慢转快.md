Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The Shilou Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Panyu County, Guangdong Province, recently convened a党员大会 (Party Member Congress) to conduct a major debate on the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, powerfully criticizing the right-leaning ideology represented by Chen Zhaoxiang.

After the summer grain purchase work began this year, many party members in Shilou Township lacked confidence in completing this year's grain purchase task. Some even consciously or unconsciously reflected the capitalist tendencies of wealthy peasants, clamoring along with them on the grain issue. Chen Zhaoxiang, the organization committee member of the Chishan First Agricultural Cooperative branch and the deputy director in charge of finance, was a typical example. Last year, Chen Zhaoxiang left 15,000 jin of grain, exceeding the quota, for use as feed in the cooperative, rather than selling it to the state as revolving grain. When the households exceeding their quotas needed grain, he shifted the responsibility to the state, telling them to ask the state for grain. After the grain purchase work began this year, he loudly complained that the state's grain purchase task was too heavy. He also believed that to improve the relationship between the Party and the masses, it was necessary to first satisfy the grain demands of the masses. If too much grain was purchased and the masses suffered from grain shortages, the leadership would be responsible. He even spread discontent among the masses, saying: "I can't accept the idea of leaving 550 jin of grain per person.”

At the党员大会 (Party Member Congress), everyone first studied the People's Daily editorial "The Grain Problem and the Ideological Problem," and then, based on the facts and targeting Chen Zhaoxiang's erroneous ideas, criticized them point by point.

Was the state's grain purchase task this year really too heavy, making it impossible to complete? Everyone revealed the following facts: After the grain purchase work began this year, Chen Zhaoxiang, taking advantage of the absence of the Party branch secretary, secretly convened a meeting with several cadres in the cooperative, without informing the deputy secretary. He arbitrarily decided to raise the grain retention quota from 550 jin to 606 jin per person and extended the early-rice retention period to four and a half months, distributing an extra 82,000 jin in total. Then, they quickly distributed the food rations to the members. At the same time, they falsely reported eleven more people, distributing an extra 2,260 jin of grain.

Was the food ration quota too low, leaving members without enough grain to eat? Everyone listed facts from various aspects for discussion. Historically, the food ration for the entire cooperative had been increasing year by year. According to a survey at one meeting, out of the 130 cooperative members present, 30 households had only 300 jin of grain per person per year before liberation, 99 households had only 450 jin to 480 jin, and only one upper-middle peasant household had 520 jin. Seven of these households had family members who starved to death before liberation. Due to increased agricultural production after liberation, the food ration increased year by year. For example, the average food ration per person in 1954 was 500 jin, increasing to 520 jin in 1955, and further increasing to 550 jin in 1956. Many people cited facts to prove that Chen Zhaoxiang's argument that 550 jin of grain per person was not enough was not in line with the facts. The small number of people who did not have enough to eat were either eating and drinking excessively or selling grain on the black market.

Finally, everyone debated the question of who benefited from blindly demanding more grain retention and selling less surplus grain. Many people pointed out that doing so would only encourage the development of capitalist tendencies among a small number of wealthy peasants, which would be detrimental to the state and also disadvantageous to agricultural cooperatives and the majority of members. Last year, because the cooperative's leadership unconditionally accommodated the members who were making trouble about grain, twenty skilled duck raisers took large amounts of grain to raise ducks themselves. In order to profit from raising ducks themselves, they were unwilling to raise ducks for the cooperative, causing great losses to the cooperative's duck-raising sideline occupation. Cooperative members who raised large numbers of ducks themselves not only reduced their enthusiasm for working for the cooperative, but some production team leaders even stopped attending team leader meetings, and some upper-middle peasant members even developed to the point of hiring labor for exploitation. At the meeting, it was also found that out of the thirty-nine households who made the most trouble about grain in the cooperative last year, twenty-seven were upper-middle peasants who raised large numbers of ducks.

Through debate, all the party members in the township received a great education and improved their class consciousness. Many party members also examined their own erroneous ideas and behaviors on the grain issue, expressing their determination to resolutely complete the state's grain purchase task. In addition to admitting the facts listed by everyone, Chen Zhaoxiang further confessed some of his erroneous behaviors, expressing his intention to correct his mistakes with practical actions to resolutely complete the state's grain purchase task.

After the party members returned to their cooperatives after the meeting, they relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a major debate on the grain issue. The debate criticized the capitalist and individualistic thinking of wealthy peasants, and the stagnant situation in the grain purchase work has been reversed.

### 不是任务过重　只怪思想右倾  石楼乡批判党内右倾思想，征购粮进度由慢转快

    不是任务过重　只怪思想右倾
    石楼乡批判党内右倾思想，征购粮进度由慢转快
    本报特约新华社广州电　中共广东省番禺县石楼乡委员会最近召开党员大会，进行粮食统购统销政策的大辩论，有力地批判了陈兆祥所代表的右倾思想。
    今年夏季购粮工作开始后，石楼乡不少党员对完成今年的购粮任务缺乏信心，有些甚至自觉或不自觉地反映了富裕农民的资本主义倾向，在粮食问题上同富裕农民一起叫嚷。中共赤山第一农业社支部的组织委员、社里负责财务工作的副主任陈兆祥，就是这样的一个典型。陈兆祥在去年曾把社里超支户的口粮一万五千斤留下作社的饲料，没有作周转粮卖给国家；等到超支户要口粮时，却把责任推给国家，叫他们向国家要口粮。今年购粮工作开始后，他又大叫国家的购粮任务过重。他还认为，要搞好党和群众关系，必须首先满足群众的粮食要求。如果粮食购多了，群众闹缺粮，就要由领导负责。他甚至在群众中散播不满的情绪，说：“每人留粮五百五十斤，我思想也不通。”
    在党员大会上，大家先学习了人民日报“粮食问题和思想问题”的社论，然后根据事实，针对陈兆祥的错误思想，逐点进行批判。
    国家今年的购粮任务是不是真的过重了，因而不能完成呢？大家揭露了这样一些事实：今年购粮工作开始后，陈兆祥乘着党支部书记不在家，瞒着支部副书记，同社里几个干部秘密开会，擅自决定把每人留粮指标从五百五十斤提高到六百零六斤，并且把早造留粮时间增加到四个半月，共多分了八万二千斤。接着，他们又赶快把口粮分到社员手里。同时，又多报十一个人，多分了口粮两千二百六十斤。
    是不是口粮指标过低，社员粮食不够吃呢？大家又从各方面列举事实来讨论。从历史上看，全社口粮是逐年增加的。据一次会议上的调查，在到会的一百三十户社员中，解放前有三十户每年每人只有三百斤口粮，有九十九户只有四百五十斤到四百八十斤，只有一户上中农有五百二十斤。这些社员中，解放前曾有七户家里饿死过人。解放后由于农业增产，口粮逐年增加。如1954年每人平均口粮是五百斤，1955年增加到五百二十斤，1956年再增到五百五十斤。许多人列举事实证明，陈兆祥所谓每人五百五十斤口粮不够吃的论调是不符合事实的，有少数人不够吃，是大吃大喝，或者把粮食在黑市卖掉了。
    最后，大家又提出了盲目要求多留口粮、少卖余粮究竟对谁有利的问题来辩论。许多人指出，这样做只会助长少数富裕农民资本主义倾向的发展，对国家不利，对农业社和多数社员也不利。去年由于社的领导方面对闹粮的社员无原则地迁就，原有二十个养鸭能手拿了大量粮食来自己养鸭。为了自己养鸭得利，就不愿为社养鸭了，使社的养鸭副业受了很大损失。社员自己养了大量的鸭，不但为社出勤的积极性降低了，而且有些生产队长连队长会议也不参加了，有些上中农社员甚至发展到雇工剥削。会上，大家还查出去年社里闹粮最凶的三十九户中，就有二十七户是大量养鸭的上中农。
    经过辩论，全乡的党员都受到了很大的教育，提高了阶级觉悟。许多党员还对照着检查自己在购粮问题上的错误思想和行为，表示要坚决完成国家的购粮任务。陈兆祥除承认大家所列举的事实以外，还进一步交代出他的一些错误行为，表示以坚决完成国家购粮任务的实际行动来改正自己的错误。
    党员们开罢会回到社里，便依靠贫农和下中农开展了粮食问题的大辩论。辩论中批判了富裕农民的资本主义和个人主义思想，粮食征购工作迟滞的局面已经扭转。
