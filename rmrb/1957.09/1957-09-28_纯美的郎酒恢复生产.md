    Pure and Beautiful Lang Liquor Resumes Production
    The Huisha Lang Liquor, with a history of more than fifty years, is one of the major famous liquors of Sichuan. It has a pure and fragrant taste and was once sold well throughout the country. However, it has been out of production for many years. Recently, the government allocated funds to restore and expand the production of Lang Liquor, which is expected to be fully put into production in the fourth quarter of this year.

    纯美的郎酒恢复生产
    具有五十多年历史的回沙郎酒，是四川的主要名酒之一。味纯而清香，曾畅销全国。可是已经停产多年。最近政府拨款恢复并扩大郎酒的生产，预计在今年第四季度即可全部投入生产。
