    A Great Debate Centered on Opposing Concealment of Production Launched
    Socialist Ideology in Rural Shanxi Ascends

    (Reported by this newspaper) A socialist ideological education movement centered on the grain issue has been widely launched in the vast rural areas of Shanxi Province and has achieved significant results.

    This education movement, through the method of a great debate, focuses on opposing the erroneous behavior of concealing grain production and deceiving the state. Party committee secretaries at the prefectural level and most county committee secretaries have personally organized this nationwide debate. According to statistics from the Xin County Party Committee, the rural population that has received preliminary education now accounts for 56.7% of the total number of people in the area who should be educated.

    This socialist ideological education movement has greatly promoted the summer grain procurement work. Before the ideological struggle against concealment and deception was launched, many people among the peasant masses and rural cadres had serious individualistic and departmentalistic ideas, concealed production, deceived the state, and were unwilling to complete the state-assigned summer wheat procurement task for this year. As of July 31, the amount of summer grain stored in warehouses throughout the province accounted for only 49.72% of the province's summer procurement task for this year. After the ideological education against concealment and deception was universally launched, the broad masses of peasants drew a clear line between right and wrong on the grain issue, and the situation underwent a fundamental change. As of August 25, the amount of summer grain stored in warehouses throughout the province accounted for 89.18% of the total procurement task for the province. Twenty-three counties and cities, including Anyi and Yangquan, have overfulfilled their summer grain procurement tasks.

    Through this ideological education, the artificially created atmosphere of grain shortage in rural areas has eased. Yangcheng County originally requested the state to supply an additional 2 million jin of grain. After education, it became clear that the people who were shouting about grain shortages mainly had ideological problems rather than grain problems. Now, the county only needs the state to supply 190,000 jin of grain. In Shentou Township, Shuo County, 549 households originally claimed to be short of grain, and they requested the state to supply 120,000 jin of grain. After a great debate, and education on diligence and thrift in managing households, the true situation of grain shortage was clarified, and only 22 households were truly short of grain. The state only needed to provide 450 jin to meet their needs.

    This socialist ideological education has greatly promoted the drought resistance and preparedness work throughout the province. While debating the grain issue, the drought situation throughout the province was very serious, and many areas closely combined the work of drought resistance and preparedness. During the drought resistance period, the Changzhi Special District organized the masses to irrigate 640,000 mu of autumn crops, of which 120,000 mu were irrigated by commune members carrying water manually. According to rough statistics from 71 counties in Xin County, Yanbei, and other regions, the irrigated area has reached more than 2.44 million mu, which has played a significant role in drought resistance and seedling protection.

    By criticizing the capitalist behavior of wealthy middle peasants using grain for black market activities, and strengthening the management of individual households on the grain issue, the gaps for capitalist development in rural areas were blocked, thereby promoting the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives. People who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives no longer did so, and more than 30,000 individual farmers joined the cooperatives.

    In this great debate centered on the grain issue, all localities generally adopted the leadership method of moving from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, first relying on key points to gain experience, and then gradually promoting it to the whole area. Some counties educated cadres and the broad masses of peasants in the county and township communes by discussing and criticizing typical examples of concealing production and deceiving the state that had been exposed, which achieved great results. After 56 agricultural cooperatives in Wutai County discussed the mistake of Liu Jinxi, director of the Dacaoping Agricultural Cooperative, in concealing production, they automatically exposed the concealed grain, which amounted to more than 1,029,000 jin.

    Judging from the situation in the province, the development of the movement is still not balanced. Some county and township cadres have not taken this movement seriously or have not paid enough attention to it; some cadres still do not dare to boldly expose the behavior of concealing production and deceiving the state; in individual villages, there have been erroneous phenomena of乱反, 乱斗, and even乱划right-wing elements among the peasants.

    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has reminded all localities to pay attention to the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems and has requested all localities to promptly take measures to solve them.

### 以反对隐瞒产量为中心开展了大辩论  山西农村社会主义思想上升

    以反对隐瞒产量为中心开展了大辩论
    山西农村社会主义思想上升
    本报讯　山西省以粮食问题为中心的社会主义思想教育运动，已在全省广大农村普遍开展起来，并收到了很大效果。
    这次教育运动通过大辩论的方式，着重反对隐瞒粮食产量、欺骗国家的错误行为。中共各地委书记和大多数县委书记都亲自动手组织了这次全民性的大辩论。据忻县地委统计，目前受到初步教育的农村人口已占到该区应受教育的总人数的56.7％。
    这次社会主义思想教育运动大大推动了小麦征购工作。在反隐瞒反欺骗的思想斗争未展开之前，在农民群众和农村干部中，不少人存在着严重的个人主义和本位主义思想，隐瞒产量，欺骗国家，不愿完成今年夏季国家分配的小麦征购任务。截至7月31日，全省入库的夏粮仅占全省今年夏季征购任务的49.72％。当普遍展开了反隐瞒反欺骗的思想教育以后，广大农民群众在粮食问题上划清了大是大非的界限，情况就发生了根本变化。截至8月25日，全省夏粮入库的数字已占全省征购任务总数的89.18％。全省已有安邑、阳泉等二十三个县、市，超额完成了夏粮征购任务。
    通过这次思想教育，农村中人为的粮食紧张空气已趋缓和。阳城县原来要求国家再供应二百万斤粮食，经过教育，弄清了叫喊缺粮的人主要是思想问题而不是粮食问题，现在全县只需要国家供应十九万斤粮食就够了。朔县神头乡十个农业社，原来叫喊缺粮的就有五百四十九户，他们要求国家供应十二万斤粮食。经过大辩论，进行了勤俭持家教育，澄清了缺粮的真实情况，真正缺粮的只有二十二户。国家只需拿四百五十斤便满足了需要。
    这次社会主义思想教育，大大推动了全省抗旱备荒工作。在辩论粮食问题的同时，全省的旱象曾经十分严重，许多地区都紧密结合了抗旱备荒工作。在抗旱期间，长治专区组织群众浇了六十四万亩秋庄稼，其中有十二万亩是发动社员用人工担水点浇的。据忻县、雁北及其他地区的七十一县的粗略统计，浇灌面积已达二百四十四万多亩，这对抗旱保苗起了很大的作用。
    经过批判富裕中农利用粮食进行黑市活动的资本主义行为，以及在粮食问题上加强了对单干户的管理，堵塞了资本主义在农村发展的空隙，从而促进了农业合作社的巩固发展。原来要退社的人不退社了，并且有三万多户单干农民参加了合作社。
    这次以粮食问题为中心的大辩论，各地一般都采取了由党内到党外，由干部到群众，先依托重点取得经验，然后再逐步推广到全面的领导方法。有些县通过讨论和批判已揭发出来的隐瞒产量欺骗国家的典型事例，向全县乡社干部和广大农民进行教育，收到很大效果。五台县五十六个农业社讨论大草坪农业社主任刘金西隐瞒产量的错误以后，自动揭发出隐瞒的粮食即有一百零二万九千多斤。
    从全省的情况来看，目前运动的开展还不够平衡，部分县乡干部，对于这次运动还没有认真地重视起来或还重视得不够；有些干部还不敢大胆地暴露隐瞒产量、欺骗国家的行为；在个别乡村中，发生了乱反、乱斗、甚至在农民当中乱划右派分子的错误现象。
    中共山西省委已提起各地注意上述缺点和问题，并要求各地迅速采取措施加以解决。
