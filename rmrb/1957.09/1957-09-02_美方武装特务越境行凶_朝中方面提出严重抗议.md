Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 1st: According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) from Kaesong, at the Secretaries Meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held on August 31st, the Secretary from the Korean and Chinese side issued a stern protest to the US side regarding the hostile act of US armed agents violating the Armistice Agreement by entering the Korean and Chinese side's area.

　　The Secretary from the Korean and Chinese side pointed out the following facts at the meeting: On August 22nd, two US armed personnel illegally crossed the Military Demarcation Line and lay in ambush near Shangmugok in the demilitarized zone south of Pingkang within the Korean and Chinese side's area. Around 1:00 AM on the 23rd, they opened fire on the civil police of the Korean and Chinese side who were on patrol, killing one Korean and Chinese civil police officer. When the Korean and Chinese civil police counterattacked in self-defense, one of the US armed personnel was wounded and captured, while the other escaped back to the US side's area.

　　According to the confession of Wang Zhenjiang, the wounded and captured US armed agent, he is a lieutenant in the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek army. On March 9th of this year, he took a US military plane to Okinawa and received training at a US intelligence agency. On June 10th, he took another US military transport plane to Yeongdeungpo and continued to receive special agent training. On August 22nd, Wang Zhenjiang and his partner Ma Yuansheng, led by US military intelligence officer Major Anderson, departed from Yeongdeungpo by car, passed through Seoul, and arrived at the southern line of the demilitarized zone. Under the instructions of US Major Anderson, Wang Zhenjiang and others crossed the Military Demarcation Line to gather military intelligence about the Chinese People's Volunteers, resulting in the aforementioned hostile act.

　　An investigation revealed that the items carried by Wang Zhenjiang were not manufactured by the Korean and Chinese side. The civil police uniform of the Chinese People's Volunteers he wore was also forged.

　　The Secretary from the Korean and Chinese side pointed out at the meeting that since the armistice, the US side has committed thirty-seven hostile acts against the Korean and Chinese side in the demilitarized zone, as formally raised by the Korean and Chinese side. This incident is by no means accidental. The Secretary from the Korean and Chinese side pointed out that this incident is another serious violation of the Armistice Agreement by the US side. He issued a stern protest to the US side and demanded that the US side take practical and effective measures to severely punish the relevant personnel.

　　However, the US side denied the facts at the meeting and evaded responsibility for the serious violation of the Armistice Agreement.

　　The Secretary from the Korean and Chinese side gave a stern rebuttal to the US side's attitude and pointed out that the records and special reports of the Joint Observer Team's investigation into this incident, as well as the relevant witness and material evidence, clearly illustrate the truth of this incident. No amount of deception and fabrication by the US side can cover up the exposed US violation of the Armistice Agreement, nor can it evade the responsibility it should bear for this.

    美方武装特务越境行凶
    朝中方面提出严重抗议
    新华社平壤1日电  据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯，在8月31日举行的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长就美方武装特务违反停战协定进入朝中方面地区进行敌对行为一事向美方提出严重的抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出下列事实：8月22日美方武装人员二名非法越过军事分界线，潜伏在平康以南朝中方面非军事区内的上墨谷附近，到23日一时前后开枪袭击正在进行巡逻的朝中方面民政警察，打死朝中方面民政警察一人。在朝中方面民政警察为了自卫而进行反击时，美方武装人员有一名负伤被捕，另一名逃回美方地区。
    据负伤被捕的美方武装特务王振江供认，他是台湾蒋介石军队中的少尉。今年3月9日乘美军飞机到冲绳岛，在美国特务机关受训。6月10日又乘美军运输机到永登浦，继续受特务训练。8月22日，王振江同他的同伴马元生由美军特务机关安得逊少校带领，乘汽车由永登浦出发，经汉城到达非军事区南线。王振江等在美军少校安得逊的指示下，越过军事分界线来刺探中国人民志愿军的军事情报，结果进行了上述的敌对行为。
    经调查，王振江随身携带的物品都不是朝中方面制造的。他穿的中国人民志愿军民政警察服装也是伪造的。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出，停战以来经朝中方面正式提出的美方在非军事区内对朝中方面进行的敌对性行为就有三十七次，这次事件决不是偶然的。朝中方面秘书长指出，这次事件是美方又一次严重违反停战协定的行为。他向美方提出严重抗议，并且要求美方采取切实有效的措施，严惩有关人员。
    但美方在会上却否认事实，逃避严重违反停战协定的责任。
    朝中方面秘书长对美方的态度给予严正的驳斥。并且指出，联合观察小组对此事件进行调查的记录和特别报告以及有关的人证物证都清楚地说明了这次事件的真相。美方任何的欺骗和捏造都不能掩盖已经暴露出来的美方违反停战协定的行为，也不能逃避对此应负的责任。
