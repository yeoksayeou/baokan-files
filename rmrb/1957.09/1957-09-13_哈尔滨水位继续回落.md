Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 12th. The water level of the Songhua River in the Harbin area had dropped to 119.66 meters by 6:00 PM today, only 16 centimeters above the warning level.

In the past few days, the Songhua River water level has been receding at a rate of more than ten centimeters per day. However, the flood control departments have not become complacent because of this. Today, there are still more than 110,000 flood-fighting soldiers fighting on the dikes in the urban area. They are actively thickening the dike toes and inspecting dangerous works to prevent any unexpected situations from occurring before the victory of the flood control struggle.

    哈尔滨水位继续回落
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　今天下午六时，哈尔滨地区松花江水位已经下降到一一九点六六公尺，高出警戒水位仅十六公分了。
    这几天，松花江水位每天以十多公分的速度回落，但是，防汛部门丝毫没有因此而产生麻痹思想。今天仍有十一万多防汛大军，战斗在市区的堤坝上。他们积极培厚堤角，检查险工，以防止在防汛斗争胜利前夕发生意外情况。
