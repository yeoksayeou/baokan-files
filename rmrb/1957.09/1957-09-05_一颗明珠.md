A Bright Pearl
By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng

We walked out of the majestic iron gates of the Gdansk Shipyard as dusk approached. In the distance, the dark green waters of the Baltic Sea nestled against the blue sky. Looking out, white sails drifted leisurely, and flocks of seagulls chased and played on the water. In this enchanting scenery, the afterglow of the setting sun added golden hues to the rosy clouds. At this moment, the Polish comrade accompanying me on the visit interrupted this rare opportunity for appreciation, squinted his eyes, and asked intentionally, "What's your impression?"

Speaking of impressions, it's hard to put it all into words....

One of the Largest Shipyards in Europe

In a spacious office, Technical Manager Czarnowski and Deputy Manager Pieskowsky introduced us to the shipyard's brief history and general situation. "Before the war, this was a shipyard owned by a German capitalist. Stimulated by Hitler's military needs, the shipyard expanded to five slipways in 1939, which was the peak of its development history. But even then, it mainly assembled ships, and internal equipment like boilers and machinery could not be manufactured here. After the war, the factory was basically destroyed by artillery fire." The Technical Manager was just narrating to this point when the Deputy Manager suddenly interjected, "I want to draw your attention to the fact that although our factory is currently built on the old site of the Germans, it is now a completely different construction."

"The main part of the shipbuilding industry is shipbuilding itself. Ships are built on slipways, so the number and shipbuilding capacity of the slipways determine the size of the shipyard," the Technical Manager continued. "Our shipyard is divided into three shipbuilding areas. The first shipbuilding area has four slipways, two of which can each build 20,000-ton ships. The second shipbuilding area has a total of five slipways, one of which can build 35,000-ton ships, two of which can each build 20,000-ton ships, and the other two can each build 5,000-ton ships. The fourth shipbuilding area is newly built and is a technically brand-new shipbuilding area."

The Deputy Manager interjected again, "I want to add a very important point: in terms of actual production capacity, our shipyard is the largest in Europe. Compared with the German Hamburg Shipyard, which is generally considered the largest in Europe, first, it does not have as many docks as our factory; second, although it can build 50,000-ton ships, in reality, they are built separately and then pieced together. We, on the other hand, can build 35,000-ton ships in one dock."

"Our factory's production plan for this year is to build five 10,000-ton ships, twelve 5,000-ton ships, and twenty 500-ton ships. We believe we can complete this plan," the Technical Manager spoke concisely and forcefully.

Another "Warsaw Speed"

Accompanied by Engineer Wawrzyniak, we got into a car and began to tour this small city-like factory. The engineer told us that they had launched a total of six 10,000-ton ships in the past few years. Their names are "Marcin," "Beirut," "Kosciuszko," "Sikorski," etc.

"Before the war, we couldn't build ocean-going ships at all. We hadn't even designed 10,000-ton ships." To provide evidence, the engineer took out the Polish Statistical Yearbook for us to see. In 1949, the total tonnage of ships built in Poland that were launched was 12,000 tons, of which only 5,400 tons were put into operation. In other words, building one 10,000-ton ship now is equivalent to the total shipbuilding volume for a whole year at that time. Now, Poland's shipbuilding industry is second only to agricultural machinery and is one of the fastest-growing industrial sectors in Poland.

Seeing that we were very interested in this, the engineer added, "If the total tonnage of self-built ships put into operation in 1949 was 5,400 tons, last year we put 119,000 tons of self-built ships into operation, and this year we expect to reach 145,000 tons. Now, we have jumped from the status of an unknown shipbuilding country to overtake some countries with shipbuilding traditions, such as Belgium, Spain, and Finland."

Hearing this, we thought: Isn't this another "Warsaw Speed"?

Not Isolated

The car stopped in front of a huge workshop, and the deafening sound of hammering and metal vibrations came in waves. In the open space outside the workshop, there were a large number of steel plates, most of which were yellow and rusty. The engineer explained to us, "The steel plates used for shipbuilding are transported from outside. They are first placed in the open air for six months to rust, and then the rust is scraped off. The steel plates are then cut into different sizes according to the design drawings. Because without the process of rusting and scraping rust, the steel plates cannot be painted." At this time, we walked into this huge workshop with a volume of 10,000 cubic meters. Many workers were drawing lines on the steel plates and writing numbers, while others were cutting the steel plates according to the lines drawn.

The first impression here was that shipbuilding is very steel-intensive because the hull and bottom of the ship are basically pieced together from steel plates. Therefore, we asked about the source of the steel plates. The engineer explained, "The steel plates here are basically supplied by Poland's own steel enterprises. Currently, due to the rapid development of the shipbuilding industry, domestic steel plates are still in short supply and a portion needs to be imported. According to the plan, within two years, there will be no need to import steel plates."

We went to another workshop, which was the welding workshop. The main task here is to weld the various steel plates sent from the "cutting workshop" into various parts. The engineer pointed out which were parts of the welded ship bottom and which were the stern.

Getting back into the car and moving forward, the engineer explained to us that the above two workshops played a preparatory role, and the main project of shipbuilding was on the slipway. On the slipway, various parts are assembled into a hull, at which time the "embryo" of the ship is formed. As he spoke, the slipway was in front of us. A 5,000-ton cargo ship under construction was lying on the slipway. The hull was surrounded by steel scaffolding as dense as a spider web, and many workers were working on it. Outside were two rows of giant mobile cranes. We found that the hull was not placed flat on the slipway, but the stern was tilted downward, and under the bottom of the ship were two huge wooden rails. According to the engineer, when the ship is roughly built in the future, it will slide into the water along this track.

Technical Innovation

Arriving at the fourth shipbuilding area, we saw a row of 500-ton ships under construction placed side by side on a horseshoe-shaped slipway. Under normal circumstances, only one ship can be built on a slipway at the same time, but on this slipway, several ships are being built at the same time. The engineer explained to us, "This is called the 'assembly line shipbuilding method'. There are not many countries in the world that use this shipbuilding method. The advantages of this shipbuilding method are: First, the speed is fast. The hull is placed at the starting point of the horseshoe-shaped slipway, and once a part is built, it is moved forward one step. When the hull is moved to the end of the slipway, a ship is roughly built. When the first ship moves forward and leaves a space, the second ship begins to be built. Soon after, when we further improve technically, a new ship can be launched roughly every ten days on this slipway. Second, it's cheaper. This shipbuilding method can save a lot of wood. Because when launching, instead of sliding down on wooden rails as usual, the 'side launch method' is used, which is equivalent to pushing the ship into the water from the side. Therefore, there is no need for wood to make the rails. Moreover, its advantage is that regardless of weather conditions, the built ships can be launched at any time."

From here, our topic turned to technical innovation. The engineer told us, "This is a very urgent task for us. We are making great efforts. Because technology largely determines shipbuilding speed. In this regard, we are still behind some countries. We plan to build a 10,000-ton ship in a maximum of three and a half months by 1960. Furthermore, ordinary ships require a large amount of wood, but wood has the disadvantages of being perishable and flammable, so its lifespan is not long. Now we are trying to reform. For example, on our self-built and launched 'Aksel Jya' 10,000-ton ship, part of the deck is made of a special plastic. It is synthesized from raw materials such as rubber and cement. The advantage is that it does not rot and is cheaper than wood. In this regard, we are studying various types of light, fireproof, and seawater-resistant plastics."

Prospects

The engineer continued to take us to visit the boiler manufacturing workshop, the labor protection workshop, and several other slipways, and we deeply felt the vastness of the factory site.

On our way back, the engineer said meaningfully, "Poland has a total of three shipyards, of which the Gdansk Shipyard is the largest. Now, the preliminary draft of the 15-year long-term plan for the Polish shipbuilding industry has been formulated. In addition to technical reforms, shipbuilding capacity will be increased fivefold during this period. In terms of ship tonnage, 35,000-ton oil tankers, 20,000-ton and 14,000-ton cargo ships will be built. If we talk about this five-year plan (up to 1960), the Polish merchant fleet will receive a total of 270,000 tons of ships from its own shipyards, which is five times the total tonnage of ships obtained during the entire post-war period." The engineer seemed to suddenly remember something, pointed at me and said, "We also build ships for China. Of course, not only China, we also build a large number of ships for the Soviet Union. Now we are also negotiating with Britain, Brazil, and Egypt about building ships for them. You see, doesn't our shipbuilding industry have broad development prospects?"

    一颗明珠
    本报记者　胡思升
    我们走出革但斯克造船厂那威武的大铁门，天色已近黄昏。远处波罗的海的墨绿色海水同蓝天倚偎在一起。放眼望去，点点白帆在悠闲地飘浮，成群的海鸥在水上追逐嬉戏。在这迷人的景色中，落日的余辉，又给它添上了金黄色的彩霞。这时，陪伴我来此地参观的波兰同志打断了这难得的欣赏机会，?了?他那眼睛，有意地问：“印象如何？”
    谈起印象，这就一言难尽了……。
    欧洲最大的造船厂之一
    在一间宽大的办公室里，技术经理查尔诺夫斯基、副经理派斯柯夫斯基同志向我们介绍造船厂的简史和概况。“在战前，这里是一个德国资本家的造船厂。这个造船厂在希特勒军事需要的刺激下，在1939年发展到拥有五个造船台，这也就是这个厂发展历史上的最高峰。但是就在那时，这里主要还只是装配船只，船只内部的锅炉等机器并不能制造。战后，这个厂也基本上被炮火破坏了。”技术经理刚叙述到这里，副经理突然插进来说了一句话，“我要提起你注意，虽然目前我们厂建设在过去德国人的旧址上，但是现在是完全另外一套建设。”
    “造船工业的主要部门就是造船本身，船是要在造船台上建造的，因此造船台的多少和造船台的造船能力就是决定造船厂大小。”技术经理接下去说：“我们这个造船厂一共分为三个造船区。第一个造船区有四个造船台，其中两个各可建造两万吨的船只。第二个造船区共有五个造船台，其中一个可造三万五千吨的船，两个各可造两万吨的船，另外两个各可造五千吨的。第四个造船区是最近新建的，这是一个技术上崭新的造船区。
    副经理又插话了：“我要补充很重要的情况，就实际生产能力来说，我们的造船厂是欧洲最大的造船厂。拿一般所说的欧洲最大的德国汉堡造船厂来比较的话，第一，它的船坞没有我们厂多；第二，虽说它可以建造五万吨的船只，但实际上它们是分开造，然后拼起来的。而我们在一个船坞内就可造三万五千吨的船。”
    “我们厂今年的生产计划是，建造五条万吨船，十二条五千吨船，二十条五百吨船，我们相信可以完成这个计划。”技术经理讲话总是简捷有力。
    又一个“华沙速度”
    在工程师瓦夫热涅克同志陪同下，我们坐上汽车，开始参观这个小城市式的工厂。工程师和我们谈最近几年他们一共下水六条一万吨的船。它们的名称是马齐号、贝鲁特号、考兹考号、西考尔斯基号等。
    “战前我们根本不会造远洋航船，万吨船连设计都没有设计过。”为了提供证据，工程师拿出波兰统计年鉴给我们看。在1949年一年内，波兰自建船只下水的加起来共一万二千吨，其中开航使用的加起来仅五千四百吨。也就是现在造一条万吨船，就等于那时一年造船的总和了。现在波兰的造船工业是仅次于农业机器业而属于波兰发展最迅速的工业部门。
    工程师看见我们对这点很感兴趣，又补充说：“如果说1949年总共开航使用的自建船只是五千四百吨，去年我们开航使用的自建船达到了十一万九千吨，今年我们预计将要达到十四万五千吨。现在，我们已经从过去默默无闻的造船国家的地位，一跃而赶过某些有造船传统的国家，像比利时、西班牙和芬兰这些国家。”
    听了这一席话，我们想：难道不是又一个“华沙速度”吗？
    不是孤立的
    汽车在一个庞大的车间前停下了，震耳欲聋的敲打声、金属的震荡声阵阵传来。在车间外面的露天空地上，放着大批钢板，大部分已经发黄生锈。工程师向我们讲解说：“造船用的钢板从外面运来，先要在露天放上六个月，让它生锈，然后把锈刮去，把钢板根据设计图切成大小不同的块块。因为不经生锈刮锈这一工序，钢板就不能上颜色。”这时我们走进这个有一万立方公尺体积的庞大车间，许多工人在钢板上划线，写上号码，另外有工人根据所划的线把钢板截开。
    在这里的第一个印象是，造船是十分耗费钢板的，因为船身、船底基本上是由钢板拼起来的。因此我们问到钢板的来源问题，工程师解释说：“这里的钢板基本上是波兰自己的钢铁企业供应的。目前由于造船业的迅速发展，本国钢板还供不应求，还需要进口一部分。根据计划，在两年内就不需要进口钢板了。”
    我们又到了一个车间，这是电焊车间。此地主要是把从“剪裁车间”送来的大小钢板焊接成各种部件。工程师指给我们看，哪些是焊好的船底的一部分，哪些是船尾。
    又坐上汽车前进，工程师向我们说明，以上两个车间起着准备工作的作用，造船的主要工程是在造船台。在造船台上，把各种部件拼成一个船身，这时，船只的 “胚胎”就形成了。说着，造船台就在我们面前了。一艘在建造中的五千吨货船正搁在造船台上，船身的四周搭着密如蜘蛛网的钢铁脚手架，许多工人在上面工作，在外面是两排巨型的移动式起重机。我们发现，船身不是平放在造船台上，而是尾部向下倾斜，在船底的下面，有两根巨木制成的轨道。据工程师说，将来船只大致造好后就依着此轨道滑行到水里。
    技术革新
    到了第四个造船区，只见一排正在建造中的五百吨的船只并排放在一个马蹄形的造船台上。在一般的情况下，一个造船台上同时只能造一条船，而在这个造船台上却同时有好几条船在建造。工程师向我们解释说：“这叫做‘流水造船法’。现在世界上采用这种造船方法的国家还不多。这种造船方法的好处是：第一，速度快。把船身放在马蹄形造船台的起点，造好一部分就往前移动一步，等到船身移到造船台的终点，一条船就大致造好了。当第一只船往前移动而留出空位时，第二条船又开始建造了。不久以后，等我们技术上再改进一步，在这种造船台上大致可以十天下水一条新船。第二，便宜。这种造船方法可以节省许多木材。因为在下水时不是像在平常那样在木头轨道上滑下去，而是利用‘侧面下水法’，等于在侧面把船推到水里去。因此就不需要木材做轨道。而且，它的优点还在于，不管气候条件，造好的船只随时可以下水。”
    从这里谈起，我们的话题就转到技术革新上去了。工程师告诉我们说：“这是我们一个十分急迫的任务。我们正在作极大的努力。因为技术在很大程度上决定造船速度。在这方面我们还落后于某些国家，我们计划到1960年每造一条万吨船最多只需三个半月。再有，一般的船上是需要大量木材的，但木材有易腐和易燃的缺点，因此寿命不长。现在我们尝试改革，如在我们自造的已开航使用的‘阿克谢雅’万吨船上，部分甲板是用一种特殊的塑料做的。它是由橡胶、水泥等原料合成的。优点是不会腐烂，价格比木材还便宜。在这方面，我们正在研究各种各样的质地轻的，能防火，防海水浸蚀的各种塑料。”
    远景
    工程师又继续带我们参观了锅炉制造车间，劳动保护车间，又转了几个造船台，深感厂址宏大。
    当我们回来的路上，工程师意味深长地说：“波兰一共有三个造船厂，其中以革但斯克造船厂为最大。现在，波兰造船工业十五年的远景规划初步草案已订出，除了技术改革外，造船能力在此期间将提高五倍。在船只吨数方面，将建造三万五千吨的油船，二万吨和一万四千吨的货船。如果谈到这个五年计划内（到1960年为止），波兰海船队将从自己的造船厂得到总吨数为二十七万吨的船只，也就是为战后整个时期所得船只总吨数的五倍。”工程师像突然记忆起了什么，指着我说：“我们也给中国造船。当然，不仅中国，我们替苏联也建造大批的船只。现在同英国，巴西，埃及也在谈判替他们造船的问题。你看，我们造船工业不是有远大的发展前途吗？”（附图片）
