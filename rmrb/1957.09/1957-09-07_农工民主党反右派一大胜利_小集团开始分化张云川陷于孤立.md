Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The Central Executive Bureau of the China Democratic Party held an enlarged rectification meeting on the 4th and 5th, during which a large amount of facts were revealed, exposing Zhang Yunchuan's lies about his reactionary activities being "lone wolf" actions. The petty clique headed by Zhang Yunchuan has now disintegrated, and Zhang Yunchuan is completely isolated. Guo Zechen, Cheng Mingyi, Zhuang Mingyuan and others pointed out at the meeting that Zhang Yunchuan and the Zhang-Luo Alliance, and the anti-communist group of Zhang (Bojun), Huang (Qixiang), and Li (Boqiu), were not only completely consistent politically, organizationally, and ideologically, but were also a "fierce general" in carrying out their anti-communist program.

    In terms of political line, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji opposed the leadership of the Communist Party and advocated for rotation of power. Zhang Yunchuan resolutely advocated that the democratic parties should "compete on an equal footing" with the Communist Party and "share the power equally." Luo Longji said that petty intellectuals from the proletariat cannot lead big intellectuals from the bourgeoisie. Zhang Yunchuan clamored that "Communist Party members are laymen." Zhang Luo opposed the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Luo Longji proposed to organize a "rehabilitation committee." Zhang Yunchuan slandered that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was lenient on top and severe on the bottom, lenient internally (within the Communist Party) and severe externally," advocating "reducing the scope." Zhang Luo opposed ideological remolding of intellectuals. Zhang Yunchuan said that intellectuals "have been remolded for many years, and have already improved, so there is no need to mention ideological remolding anymore."

    In terms of organizational line, Zhang Luo advocated "vigorous development" of democratic parties, and Zhang Yunchuan was an enthusiastic supporter and executor. He advocated developing towards small and medium-sized cities, towards all classes, and the middle and lower levels. When he revised the section on organizational development in the work report of the Central Committee of the China Democratic Party, he added the words "mainly on development" to the organizational policy of combining development and consolidation that all democratic parties jointly abide by, and changed the original expansion of members by one to two times to "two to four times." Zhang Yunchuan also personally went to Henan and other places to recruit troops and buy horses, everywhere promoting Zhang Bojun's policy of vigorous development. Luo Longji opposed the Communist Party developing Party members among intellectuals, attempting to have the democratic parties take over the intellectuals. Zhang Yunchuan completely agreed with Luo's reactionary proposition.

    Zhang Yunchuan not only had a deep relationship with the Zhang-Luo Alliance, but also had a deep relationship with Zhang Dongsun, Zhou Jingwen, Wang Shiming, Fan Puzhai, and Zhang Zhihe of Luo Longji's anti-communist petty clique.

    Last year, when Zhang Bojun returned from Beidaihe, which was when the Zhang-Luo Alliance was formed, Zhang Bojun summoned Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Yang Yitang, He Shikun, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Yifan and others to his home to hold a meeting, secretly plotting to establish core leadership, develop the organization of the China Democratic Party, attack the leftists within the China Democratic Party, and exclude dissidents. This spring, Zhang Bojun summoned Zhang Yunchuan and seven others to a "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" meeting, asking the "Eight Immortals" to strengthen unity, separately take charge of the work of the Central Committee of the China Democratic Party, attempting to turn the China Democratic Party into a tool for the Zhang-Luo Alliance to oppose communism and the people. Zhang Yunchuan expressed great satisfaction with Zhang Bojun's "arrangement."

    Wang Shanji, Wang Dalu, He Dajun and others systematically exposed the ugly face and conspiratorial activities of Zhang Yunchuan's reactionary petty clique at the meeting. This conspiracy group engaged in the heinous activities of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism in an organized and planned manner.

    This petty clique was formed as early as 1949. This petty clique has a large number of people and is widely distributed, from the central government to the local governments, from within the China Democratic Party to outside the China Democratic Party. It is an organization with extensive connections. Its members include important figures in the Central Committee of the China Democratic Party such as He Zhongmin, Qiu Elun, Ding Fangtuo, Yan Daoying, and Wang Zhongying; in local organizations, there are Li Xiangruo in Hefei City, Anhui Province, Wu Menghui in Tianjin, Jin Baimiao in Bengbu, and Meng Yucun in Beijing. Among the general members are Zhang Pengfei, Yang Renzhi, Zhang Zhenhua, Zhang Zuoyan, etc. Among the non-members is Zhang Juefei (Zhang Yunchuan's uncle). The members of this petty clique are all disgruntled people who hate the Communist Party and hate the working people. The members of this petty clique unanimously supported Zhang Yunchuan as the "commander," He Zhongmin was the "military advisor" who planned everything, Ding Fangtuo was the organizer and "thug" of the conspiratorial activities, Qiu Elun was the link between the Zhang-Huang-Li right-wing group, Yan Daoying was responsible for propaganda and spreading rumors, Wang Zhongying tipped off information, and Meng Yucun, Zhang Zhenhua, Yang Renzhi, Zhang Juefei and others served as intelligence liaisons. This petty clique has a deliberation office, liaison stations, and secret rooms for planning.

    This petty clique fought for power and profit within the China Democratic Party, placing each member in an important position. They wore the guise of "fighting for justice," supported right-wing elements, attacked leftists, and isolated Communist Party members. For several years, many problems and disputes in the China Democratic Party have been created by this petty clique.

    After everyone's systematic exposure, Ding Fangtuo, Qiu Elun, Meng Yucun and other core members of Zhang Yunchuan's anti-communist petty clique admitted that they had committed crimes against the Party and the people, and were willing to bow their heads and confess their sins and start anew. Zhang Yunchuan's "military advisor," He Zhongmin, although he admitted some things after Ding Fangtuo's confrontation, did not specifically confess.

    Faced with the facts revealed by everyone, and with the members of his petty clique surrendering one after another, Zhang Yunchuan was in a terrible state, and had to admit that his inspection tours to various places were "specifically to find shortcomings" and collect materials as the basis for his anti-communist and anti-people activities. In Henan, Anhui, and Xinjiang, he "said some inflammatory things, everywhere creating contradictions between the people and the government, inciting the masses to be dissatisfied with the Communist Party, and sowing discord between the masses and the Party and the government." He admitted that "his petty clique is anti-communist and anti-socialist."

### 农工民主党反右派一大胜利  小集团开始分化张云川陷于孤立

    农工民主党反右派一大胜利
    小集团开始分化张云川陷于孤立
    据新华社6日讯　中国农工民主党中央执行局4、5两日连续举行整风扩大会议，在会上揭发的大量的事实，揭穿了张云川对他的反动活动说成是“独来独往”的所谓“跑单帮”的谎言。以张云川为首的小集团现在已经分化，张云川完全陷于孤立。郭则沉、程明亦、庄明远等人在会上指出张云川和章罗联盟，和章（伯钧）、黄（琪翔）、李（伯球）反共集团不仅在政治上、组织上、思想上是完全一致的，而且是执行他们的反共纲领的一员“悍将”。
    在政治路线上，章伯钧、罗隆基反对共产党领导，主张轮流坐庄，张云川就坚决主张民主党派同共产党“分庭抗礼”、“平分秋色”；罗隆基说，无产阶级小知识分子不能领导资产阶级大知识分子，张云川则叫嚣“共产党员是外行”；章罗反对肃反，罗隆基提出要组织“平反委员会”，张云川诬蔑说“肃反上轻下重，内轻（共产党内）外重”，主张“将范围缩小”。章罗反对知识分子进行思想改造，张云川说，知识分子“改造多年了，已有了提高，可以不必再提思想改造了”。
    在组织路线上，章罗主张民主党派“大发展”，张云川是狂热的拥护者和执行者，他主张向中小城市、向各阶层、中下层发展。他在修改农工中央工作报告中关于发展组织的部分，将各民主党派共同遵守的发展与巩固相结合的组织方针，加上“以发展为主”五个字，将原有成员发展一倍至二倍改为“二倍至四倍”。张云川还亲自到河南等地去招兵买马，到处宣传章伯钧的大发展方针。罗隆基反对共产党在知识分子中发展党员，企图由民主党派把知识分子包下来，张云川完全赞成罗的这个反动主张。
    张云川不但和章罗联盟的关系很深，同时和罗隆基反共小集团的张东荪、周鲸文、汪世铭、范朴斋、张志和的关系也是很深的。
    去年章伯钧从北戴河回来，也就是章罗联盟形成的时候，章伯钧曾召集黄琪翔、李伯球、杨逸棠、何世琨、张云川、王一帆等人在他家里开会，密谋建立核心领导，发展农工党组织，打击农工党内的左派，排斥异己。今年春天，章伯钧又召集张云川等八人开“八仙过海”的会，要“八仙”加强团结，分别负担农工中央的工作，企图把农工党变成章罗联盟反共反人民的工具，张云川对章伯钧的“安排”表示非常满意。
    王善继、王大鲁、何大钧等在会上系统地揭发了张云川反动小集团的丑恶面貌和阴谋活动。这个阴谋集团有组织、有计划地进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动。
    远在1949年这个小集团就形成了，这个小集团人数多，散布广，从中央到地方，从农工党内到农工党外，是一个有着广泛联系的组织。它的成员，在农工中央有何仲珉、丘锷仑、丁方拓、阎道莹、王仲英等重要分子；在地方组织中有安徽省合肥市的李湘若、天津的吴孟辉、蚌埠的金白描、北京市的孟雨村等。在一般成员中有张朋非、杨任之、张振华、张祚延等，在非成员中，有张觉非（张云川的叔父）。这个小集团的成员有的历史上有血债，有的作过汉奸、特务，有伪军人，有贪污分子，另外，还有张云川的六亲好友，他们都是一些仇恨共产党，仇恨劳动人民的心怀不满的人。这个小集团的成员一致拥护张云川做“统帅”，何仲珉是策划一切的“军师”，丁方拓是阴谋活动的组织人和“打手”，丘锷仑是章黄李右派集团的牵线人，阎道莹负责宣传造谣，王仲英通风报信，孟雨村、张振华、杨任之、张觉非等这一批人担任情报联络。这个小集团有议事处，有联络站和进行策划时的密室。
    这个小集团在农工民主党内争权夺利，他们把每个成员都安置在重要岗位上。他们披着“打抱不平”的外衣，支持右派分子，打击左派，孤立共产党员。几年以来，农工党的许多问题，许多纠纷，都是这个小集团制造的。
    经过大家系统地揭露以后，张云川反共小集团中的骨干分子丁方拓、丘锷仑、孟雨村等人承认自己犯了反党、反人民的罪过，愿意低头认罪，重新作人。张云川的“军师”何仲珉，虽然经过丁方拓的对质承认了一些东西，但没有具体交代。
    张云川在大家揭发的事实面前，在他的小集团成员纷纷投降的情况下，狼狈不堪，不得不承认去各地视察是“专为找缺点”，搜集材料作为他反共反人民的根据。他在河南、安徽、新疆“讲了一些放火的话，到处制造人民与政府的矛盾，煽动群众对共产党不满，挑拨群众对党和政府的关系。”他承认“他的这个小集团是反共、反社会主义的。”
