Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, headed by A. B. Aristov, arrived in Beijing by special plane this morning.

They are visiting China at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Soviet Ambassador to China, Yudin, accompanied the delegation to Beijing.

Today, the Chinese and Soviet national flags fluttered at Beijing Airport. The delegation received a warm welcome from Chairman Liu Shaoqi and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the airport, extending a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people. He said that your visit brings the profound friendship of the Soviet people. The friendship between the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union is an unbreakable friendship, which not only embodies the supreme interests of our two peoples and the great solidarity of the socialist camp, but also is an important guarantee for maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress.

Aristov then spoke. He said that the common goal of striving for peace, democracy, and socialism, the belief in the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and the intention of fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance unite the people of our two countries. Our friendship and solidarity are the pillars for continuing to consolidate the socialist camp and the factors for world peace. He also pointed out the importance of unity among the people of socialist countries.

He said that the fraternal friendship and cooperative relations between the people of the Soviet Union and China are constantly developing and consolidating. He hoped that the delegation's visit to China would further develop and consolidate this friendship and solidarity.

At 8:30 this morning, the delegation's special plane landed at Beijing Airport. After the distinguished guests disembarked, they warmly shook hands with the Chinese state leaders who were waiting to greet them. A group of girls presented them with flowers. Thunderous applause rang out at the airport. The welcoming people shouted: "Welcome the Delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union!" "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!" "Long Live World Peace!"

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation today included Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Vice Premier Ulanhu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Yuzhang, and responsible persons of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

Charge d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, G. T. Titov, Soviet experts and students in Beijing also went to the airport to welcome them.

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Chairman Liu Shaoqi held a banquet this evening to welcome the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union headed by Aristov.

In his speech at the banquet, Chairman Liu Shaoqi welcomed the distinguished guests and said: The Soviet Union is a strong fortress of the socialist camp and the defense of world peace. The Soviet Union unswervingly pursues a foreign policy of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems. The Soviet Union's position on international affairs is always consistent with the position of the broad masses of people in various countries. The Soviet Union's support for the just struggle of the Egyptian and Syrian people to safeguard their national independence, its various efforts to ease the tense situation created by the United States in the Near East, and its various measures to strive for agreements with Western countries on the cessation of testing and prohibition of atomic weapons and on the entire disarmament issue, have been warmly supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. The recent Soviet announcement of the successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile once again demonstrated the powerful strength of the Soviet Union in defending world peace. The Chinese people will always work together with the Soviet people to safeguard world peace.

Liu Shaoqi warmly congratulated the great October Socialist Revolution and highly praised the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction over the past forty years. He said that the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people have greatly encouraged the confidence and strength of the Chinese people in building socialism.

He said: The people of China and the Soviet Union have a profound friendship. The common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the common cause of building socialism and communism closely link us together. This is the most reliable guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress. The Soviet Union has continuously given our country tremendous assistance, fully demonstrating the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in various fields is constantly strengthening and making new progress. This friendly cooperative relationship is also reflected in parliamentary exchanges. He said that he firmly believes that through this visit to China by the delegation, the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people will be further enhanced.

Head of Delegation Aristov then spoke, expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the warm hospitality of the hosts.

He said that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union attaches great importance to mutual visits by parliamentary delegations from various countries. This visit to China by the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is a continuation of the traditional ties and ever-expanding cooperation between the parliaments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and between the political activists of the two countries.

Aristov said: Everywhere in our country, people are warmly and respectfully saying: Soviet people and Chinese people are eternal brothers! No force in the world can shake the friendship and unity between our two great peoples.

He warmly congratulated the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and congratulated the Chinese people on the brilliant achievements in socialist construction.

Aristov said: People's China has made great contributions to the cause of striving for peace and easing international tensions. The policy of peace and friendship among the people of all countries pursued by People's China has won the full support of peace-loving people all over the world. At present, no international issue of any seriousness can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China, with its 600 million people.

Aristov mentioned that the Soviet people are preparing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, that the Soviet people are striving to realize the grand plan of communist construction, and will continue to contribute all their strength to consolidating the unity of the powerful socialist camp, the friendship between the people of all countries, and the cause of peace.

Aristov said that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is constantly strengthening and consolidating. On the basis of the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for each other'
