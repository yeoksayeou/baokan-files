Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 1st. Peng Wenying, a general of the Zhang-Luo alliance and an extremely stubborn and cunning backbone element of the rightists, took the opportunity of making a self-criticism and confession yesterday afternoon to counterattack the Communist Party and the people at the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, using methods of boasting, denying, arguing, and refusing to admit his mistakes, which aroused great anger among the representatives.

For more than two months, Peng Wenying participated in sixteen large and small meetings exposing and criticizing his crimes. In this People's Congress, he had six days of intense debate with the people's representatives, and he has already been refuted to the point of being logically defeated and fully exposing his ugly state. But he still maintained a stubborn attitude to the end and tried his best to fabricate rumors, distort and reverse right and wrong in today's "confession" that he called "honest and realistic."

Peng Wenying shamelessly boasted that he had "contributed" to the underground work of the China Democratic League and was unreasonably attacked by Shi Liang and others after liberation, but he "always used his brains and wanted to do more for the people." Regarding the Zhang-Luo alliance, he said, he "only knew about it after reading the newspaper and was surprised." He said that some of his reactionary remarks were labeled as arson and malicious slander, which was "like a bolt from the blue," making him "bewildered and at a loss." At this time, representatives sent notes one after another, accusing him of telling lies with his eyes wide open at the solemn People's Congress meeting.

But Peng Wenying still did not consider everyone's warning and even more frantically slandered Chen Renbing and Shen Zhiyuan, backbone members of the Zhang-Luo alliance, who had made preliminary confessions and exposed some of his crimes. As for his crimes of madly opposing the Communist Party and socialism, he only lightly described them as "confused and naive," "often exaggerating trivial matters," "not investigating the facts, but only relying on subjective views, and speaking lightly"... Before he had time to read the conclusion he had drawn for himself in his speech: "He loves this society and this country. He is dissatisfied with the status quo. He thinks about the future. He uses all his energy to come up with ways to improve work, eliminate shortcomings, and improve the people's welfare and move society forward," the people's representatives could no longer restrain the anger in their hearts. More than a hundred notes of protest and exposure were sent to the rostrum like snowflakes. Representatives of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen stood up one after another, demanding to speak out and refute Peng Wenying. The presidium of the conference accepted the representatives' request and stopped Peng Wenying's rogue "confession."

Jiang Xuemo, a nonvoting delegate, had originally prepared a speech entitled "Exposing the Rogue Tactics of the Right-Wing Backbone Element Peng Wenying's Resolute Resistance, Evasion, and Sophistry." At this time, he stated that he was not prepared to say much more. Peng Wenying had just shown his own rogue tactics, revealing his rogueness without reservation.

Liu Dezhong, a lecturer at Fudan University and a member of the China Democratic League, indignantly stepped onto the podium and, as a participant, exposed Peng Wenying's fangs and claws in mobilizing League members at a grassroots cadre meeting of the China Democratic League to "take an oath" and "march toward democracy." At the League members' meeting in the Ti Lan Qiao district, Peng Wenying shouted, "Revolution must have struggle, and struggle must shed blood!" He wanted League members to set fires everywhere. For a time, the representatives under the stage questioned Peng Wenying one after another: Who exactly are you fighting against? Who should shed blood? Peng Wenying was restless and stammered under this storm of questions. He still wanted to quibble in the end. Some representatives stood up again and said that they had personally heard Peng Wenying say this, and there were records to check. Then, Hu Ziying exposed that Peng Wenying was a rightist in the National Salvation Association. He had donated a sum of money to Yan Xishan in the name of the National Salvation Association, but he embezzled all of it. Hu Ziying asked him to answer on the spot whether this was true. Peng Wenying's face was pale, and he flatly denied it. Hu Ziying said that Peng Wenying had apologized to her for this matter two days ago, but now he turned his back and refused to admit it, which was extremely shameless. Representatives on the spot questioned Peng Wenying: If you did not embezzle, why did you apologize? Peng Wenying was speechless and extremely embarrassed. Professor Su Buqing pointed out that in terms of the stubbornness and die-hard nature of opposing the Communist Party and socialism, Peng Wenying ranked first in the Shanghai right-wing group of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Peng Wenying's rampant anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities were a microcosm of the bourgeois rightists' resolute resistance to the socialist road.

Worker and peasant representatives also came to the stage one after another, expressing their great anger at Peng Wenying's rampant attacks. There were so many people who wanted to speak that the chairman had to announce an extension of the meeting time.

    庄严的人民讲坛决不许右派猖獗
    彭文应反扑未成遭到迎头痛击
    在代表们进一步揭发和暴风雨般的质问下彭文应狼狈万状
    据新华社上海1日电  章罗联盟的大将极其顽固狡猾的右派骨干分子彭文应，昨天下午借检讨交代的机会采取吹、赖、辩、死不认账的手法，在上海市人代会全体会议上向共产党和人民反扑，引起代表们极大的愤怒。
    两个多月来，彭文应参加了揭发批判他的罪行的十六次大小会议，在这次的人代会上又和人民代表们进行了六天的激烈辩论，已被驳得理屈词穷，丑态毕露。而他还是抱着顽抗到底的态度在今天的自称为“老老实实、实事求是”的“交代”中极尽造谣歪曲颠倒黑白之能事。
    彭文应厚着脸皮首先吹嘘自己作民盟地下工作“有功”，解放后竟受到史良等人的无理打击，而他“总是多动脑筋，想多为人民做一点事情”。关于章罗联盟，他是“看了报纸才晓得，而且感到惊异”。他说，说他的一些反动言行是放火，是恶意中伤，“这就像晴天霹雳”，使他“彷徨失措”。这时，代表们纷纷递条子，指责他在庄严的人民代表大会会议上瞪着两眼说瞎话。
    但彭文应仍然不考虑大家的警告，更猖狂地在会上谩骂已作初步交代并揭发了他的一些罪行的章罗联盟骨干分子陈仁炳、沈志远。而对自己疯狂反共反社会主义的罪行，只轻描淡写的说成是“糊涂天真”、“常常夸大细小”、“不调查事实，只凭主观，轻于说话”……。他还没有来得及念到发言稿中给自己下的结论：“热爱这个社会这个国家，他不满现状，他想到将来，一天到晚用尽心思，采取办法，来改进工作，消灭缺点，以增进人民的福利，把社会推向前进”，人民代表们以实在捺不住心头的怒火，一百多张抗议、揭露他的条子雪片似地送到了主席台上，工人、农民、知识分子、工商业者代表都纷纷起立，要求发言驳斥彭文应，大会主席团接受代表们的要求，制止了彭文应的无赖的“交代”。
    列席代表蒋学模原来准备了以“拆穿右派骨干分子彭文应坚决顽抗的狡赖狡辩的无赖手法”为题的发言。这时他声明，他不准备多说了，彭文应刚才已经现身说法，把自己的无赖手法表露无遗了。
    民盟盟员复旦大学讲师刘德中气愤地登上讲台以亲身参加者的身份揭发彭文应在民盟基层干部大会上张牙舞爪地动员盟员“誓师”“向民主进军”。在提篮桥区盟员大会上，彭文应曾高呼“革命一定要有斗争，斗争一定要流血！”他要盟员到处去放火。一时台下的代表纷纷质问彭文应：究竟向谁斗争？要谁流血？彭文应在这暴风雨般的质问下，坐立不是，支吾其词。他最后还想狡赖。当场又有一些代表站起来说，他们亲自听到彭文应讲过，有记录可查。接着，胡子婴又揭露彭文应在救国会时就是个右派。他曾以救国会的名义向阎锡山捐过一笔钱，结果全部给他贪污了。胡子婴要他当场答复这是不是事实。彭文应面色苍白，矢口否认。胡子婴说，前两天彭文应还为此事向她道歉，现在翻脸不认账，真是无耻之极。当场代表质问彭文应：你既没有贪污，为何要道歉？彭文应无言对答，狼狈已极。苏步青教授指出，就反共反社会主义的顽固性和死硬性来看，彭文应在章罗联盟上海右派集团中居第一位。彭文应猖狂反共反社会主义的活动，正是资产阶级右派对社会主义道路坚决顽抗的一个缩影。
    工人和农民代表也纷纷上台，他们对彭文应的猖狂进攻表示万分愤怒。要求发言的人非常多，主席不得不宣告延长开会时间。
