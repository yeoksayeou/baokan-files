Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch – The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions will be held on December 2nd of this year. This congress will comprehensively summarize the work of the trade unions since the Seventh National Congress, elect the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and discuss the report on amending the Constitution of the Trade Unions of the People's Republic of China. This decision was adopted at the National Trade Union Representative Meeting that opened in Beijing today.

Lai Ruoyu delivered a speech at today's representative meeting. He said that in addition to discussing the preparations for convening the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, this representative meeting will also focus on studying the rectification and socialist education movement in enterprises, as well as the problem of welcoming the new upsurge in production and construction that will emerge on the basis of rectification, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. At the same time, issues related to wages and the welfare of employees will be discussed.

A total of 189 representatives from the trade union federations of various provinces and cities, and from various industrial trade unions, attended the meeting.

Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, introduced the situation of rectification in industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing at today's meeting.

Wang Jiayang, Minister of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a speech on the increase production and practice economy movement at today's meeting. He analyzed the situation of the increase production and practice economy movement in the first half of this year. Wang Jiayang said that this year's increase production and practice economy movement is in-depth and widespread, the production enthusiasm of the masses of workers is also high, the state plan and the increase production and practice economy plan for January to August have been overfulfilled, and many new experiences have been gained in the movement. Wang Jiayang said that the rectification and socialist education movement is now gradually and universally unfolding in enterprises. After extensive airing of views, debates, and rectification while correcting shortcomings, the appearance of enterprises will inevitably be renewed, and the socialist consciousness of workers will be greatly improved. A new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy movement will emerge. In addition, this year is the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, and the enthusiasm of the masses of workers to comprehensively overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and welcome the Second Five-Year Plan is also very high. Therefore, we should fully estimate and grasp this favorable new situation, and proactively prepare to promote a new upsurge in production and construction.

In response to some problems in the current development of the increase production and practice economy movement and the advanced producer movement, Wang Jiayang put forward several tasks that should be strengthened and improved in the future: (1) Continue to attach importance to summarizing and promoting advanced experiences and organizing the masses to carry out rationalization proposals; (2) Rely on veteran workers, unite young workers, and at the same time give full play to the role of personnel in the departments to jointly improve production; (3) Improve the summary, evaluation, and reward work of socialist competitions; (4) Improve the organizational leadership of socialist competitions; (5) Strengthen safety production work.

Wang Rong, Minister of the Wage Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also made a speech on wage issues at today's meeting.

The meeting is scheduled to last for four days.

　　全国工会代表会议开幕
　　准备第八次代表大会、研究整风工作、迎接建设高潮
    新华社16日讯　中国工会第八次全国代表大会将在今年12月2日召开。这次大会将全面总结第七次全国代表大会以来的工会工作，选出中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会和讨论修改中华人民共和国工会章程的报告。这项决定，是今天在北京开幕的全国工会代表会议上通过的。
    赖若愚在今天的代表会议上致词。他说，这次代表会议除了讨论有关召开中国工会第八次全国代表大会的准备工作以外，还将根据中共中央指示，着重研究企业中进行整风和社会主义教育运动以及迎接在整风的基础上即将出现的生产和建设新高潮的问题，同时讨论一下有关工资和职工生活福利的问题。
    出席这次会议的有各省、市工会联合会和各个产业工会的代表共一百八十九名。
    北京市工会联合会主席王炯在今天的会议上介绍了北京市工矿企业整风的情况。
    全国总工会生产部部长王家扬，在今天的会上作了关于增产节约运动的发言。他分析了今年上半年的增产节约运动情况。王家扬说，今年的增产节约运动是深入、广泛的，职工群众的生产情绪也是高涨的，1到8月份的国家计划和增产节约计划都已经超额完成，并且在运动中取得了许多新的经验。王家扬说，目前整风和社会主义教育运动正在企业中逐步普遍深入展开，经过大鸣大放、辩论和边整边改以后，企业面貌必然焕然一新，职工的社会主义觉悟也将大大提高，增产节约运动将会出现新高潮；加上今年是第一个五年计划的最后一年，职工群众要求全面超额完成第一个五年计划，迎接第二个五年计划的热情也很高，因此我们应该充分估计和掌握这个有利的新形势，主动做好准备工作，以促进生产上、建设上新高潮的到来。
    王家扬针对当前开展增产节约运动和先进生产者运动中的一些问题，提出了今后应注意加强和改进的几项工作：（一）继续重视总结、推广先进经验和组织群众开展合理化建议；（二）要依靠老工人、团结青年工人，同时要发挥科室人员的作用来共同搞好生产；（三）改进社会主义竞赛的总结评比和奖励工作；（四）改进社会主义竞赛的组织领导工作；（五）加强安全生产工作。
    全国总工会工资部部长王榕也在今天的会上就工资问题作了发言。
    这次会议预定举行四天。
