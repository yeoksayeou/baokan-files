Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The President of the Federal People's Assembly of Yugoslavia and Head of the Federal People's Assembly Delegation of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, Petar Stambolić, hosted a banquet at noon today to entertain Chinese national leaders and people from all walks of life.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi attended the luncheon.

Stambolić spoke at the luncheon. He said: Although our two countries are far apart and have different conditions for development, this is not important. We have come to a socialist country, to a country that we respect and love, and here we feel like we are at home. I am convinced that this visit by the delegation will contribute to our common cause and common goals. Socialism has been practiced among a considerable part of the world's nations, so the exchange of experiences between socialist countries becomes an important matter. The visit of the Chinese National People's Congress delegation to Yugoslavia at the beginning of this year and our visit to China will strengthen the exchange of experience between the two countries. Of course, the exchange of experience is not the only form of cooperation between socialist countries, and cooperation should be multifaceted. We should cooperate in this way: mobilizing all progressive forces in the world; and our cooperation should contribute to the progress of all mankind and the consolidation of peace in the world.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said at the meeting: For the benefit of the people of China and Yugoslavia and progressive people all over the world, and for the sake of maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress, the people of China and Yugoslavia have a common desire to further strengthen the unity and cooperation between our two countries. I believe that through your visit, especially through our comradely talks, we will deepen the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and Yugoslavia and promote the unity and cooperation between our two countries.

Also present at the luncheon were Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and members, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and well-known people from all walks of life.

Yugoslav Ambassador to China, Popović, also attended the banquet.

　　南议会代表团团长宴请我国家领导人
   新华社18日讯　南斯拉夫联邦国民议会主席、南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国联邦国民议会代表团团长彼得·斯坦鲍利奇今天中午举行宴会，招待中国国家领导人和各界人士。
    刘少奇委员长出席了午宴。
    斯坦鲍利奇在午宴上讲话。他说：虽然我们两国相距很远，而且发展条件各不相同，但是这无关重要。我们来到了社会主义的国家，来到了我们所尊重的所热爱的国家，在这里我们就像在家里一样。我深信，代表团这次访问将有助于我们共同事业和共同目的。社会主义已在世界上相当一部分民族当中实践，因此，各社会主义国家间交换经验，就成为重要的事情，今年年初中国全国人民代表大会代表团访问南斯拉夫和我们这次访问中国，将加强两国经验的交流。当然，交流经验并不是社会主义国家间合作的唯一形式，合作应是多方面的。我们应该这样合作：动员起全世界所有进步力量；并应该使我们的合作有助于全世界人类的进步事业和和平的巩固。
    刘少奇委员长在会上讲话说：为了中南两国人民和全世界进步人类的利益，为了维护世界和平和发展人类进步事业，中南两国人民有着进一步加强我们两国的团结和合作的共同愿望。我相信通过你们的访问，特别是通过我们之间同志式的交谈，必将加深中南两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊，促进我们两国的团结和合作。
    出席午宴的，还有全国人民代表大会常委会副委员长林伯渠、李济深、黄炎培、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通和委员们，外交部副部长姬鹏飞和各界著名人士。
    南斯拉夫驻中国大使波波维奇也出席了宴会。
