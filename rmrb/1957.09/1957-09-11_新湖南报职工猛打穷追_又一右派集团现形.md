Xinhua News Agency report: New Hunan Daily Employees Vigorously Pursue and Ferret Out
Another Rightist Group

    According to Xinhua News Agency, employees of the New Hunan Daily have exposed another rightist clique. The members of this rightist clique are Tang Yin-sun (member of the China Democratic League, member of the Communist Youth League), Zhong Shu-he (member of the Communist Youth League), Zheng Chang-ren (member of the Communist Youth League), Zhu Chun (member of the Communist Youth League), and Li Chang-gong, all editors of the New Hunan Daily.

    This rightist clique went all out to support the anti-Party element Su Xin-tao, openly inciting some people in the editorial department of the New Hunan Daily to demand the removal of the newspaper's editor-in-chief so that rightists like Su Xin-tao could take over. They also secretly plotted with the rightist clique of the China Democratic League outside the newspaper to run a "collective journal" under the leadership of the rightists of the China Democratic League and with the sympathy and support of Su Xin-tao and others; this "collective journal" would be anti-Communist and anti-people.

　　新湖南报职工猛打穷追
    又一右派集团现形
    据新华社讯　新湖南报社职工又揭发出一个右派小集团。这个右派小集团的成员有唐荫荪（民盟盟员、共青团员）、锺叔河（共青团员）、郑昌壬（共青团员）、朱纯（共青团员）和李长恭，都是新湖南报的编辑。
    这个右派小集团极力为反党分子苏辛涛捧场，公开煽动新湖南报编辑部一些人提出要报社总编辑下台，请右派分子苏辛涛等人上台。他们还和社外的民盟右派集团密谋筹办一张在民盟右派领导下的并得到苏辛涛等同情和支持的反共反人民的“同人报”。
