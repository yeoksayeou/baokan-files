Starting with the Case of Korean Screen
　　Zheng Bai
    The report on the Supreme People's Court's verdict in the "Korean Screen Counter-Revolutionary Case" (see yesterday's newspaper) mentioned the rightist Huang Shaohong, who styled himself as "Today's Bao Gong." This is because, in March of this year, Huang Shaohong, on the solemn rostrum of the CPPCC conference, used the "Korean Screen Counter-Revolutionary Case" as a "vivid" "example" of his attack on the people's judicial organs. Huang Shaohong deliberately set aside Korean Screen's counter-revolutionary crimes, not mentioning a single word, but maliciously slandered the correct judgment of Longguan County against Han. He believed that if the Hebei Provincial People's Court had not reversed the sentence, Korean Screen would have been "wrongfully drowned."

    However, after a thorough inspection and retrial by the Supreme People's Court, it has now been decided to revoke the erroneous judgment of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court and uphold the original judgment of the Longguan County People's Court. This fact fully demonstrates the correctness of the original handling by the Longguan County People's Court, and it was not at all a case of "wrongfully drowned." If it were not so, Korean Screen, a counter-revolutionary element with both historical crimes and current activities, would have become a "fish that escaped the net." Now, this counter-revolutionary case is as solid as a mountain, and Huang Shaohong's attempt to overturn the case for counter-revolutionary elements is futile and a waste of effort.

    This is just one of the many so-called "vivid" "examples" that the rightist Huang Shaohong created in his attack on the people's judicial organs. Of course, Huang Shaohong is not the only rightist who hates the people and enthusiastically helps counter-revolutionary elements and all bad elements. In addition to Huang Shaohong, there are also Tan Tiwu on Wang Yufeng as a "vivid" "example" as previously reported, Luo Longji on Chen Kun as a "vivid" "example," and Han Zhao'e on the counter-revolutionary riot in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, as a "vivid" "example."

    With so many "examples," one cannot help but wonder what kind of magic supports these rightists in doing so? Take Huang Shaohong as an example. This rightist himself was originally an anti-communist and anti-people fellow with his hands stained with blood. Therefore, when he saw counter-revolutionary elements being punished by the people, he had a feeling of "the rabbit dying, the fox feeling sorrow," and he wanted to use his power to "redress grievances" for them in every possible way in order to win them over as anti-communist capital.

    However, the people's eyes are discerning, and the rightists' attempt to overturn the case for counter-revolutionary elements will ultimately go bankrupt. The case of Korean Screen is one obvious example.

　　从韩国屏案件谈起
　　郑白
    最高人民法院宣判“韩国屏反革命案件”的报道中（见昨日本报），提到了自称为“今包公”的右派分子黄绍竑。因为，今年3月间，黄绍竑在庄严的政协会议的讲坛上，就把“韩国屏反革命案件”作为他向人民司法机关进攻的一个“生动”的“例子”。黄绍竑故意撇开韩国屏的反革命罪行，一字不谈，却将龙关县对韩的正确判决做了恶意的污蔑。并认为，如果不是河北省人民法院改判，韩国屏就会“冤沉海底”。
    可是这个案件，经过最高人民法院彻底检查，重新审理后，现在决定，撤销了河北省高级人民法院的错误判决，维持龙关县人民法院的原判。这个事实，充分说明了龙关县人民法院原来处理的正确，根本不是什么“冤沉海底”。如果不是这样，韩国屏这个既有历史罪行，又有现行活动的反革命分子倒反而会成为“漏网之鱼”。现在，这个反革命案件是铁案如山，黄绍竑要替反革命分子翻案，是翻不了的，是枉费心机的。
    这仅仅是右派分子黄绍竑向人民司法机关进攻中所制造的许多所谓“生动”的“例子”之一。当然，由于右派分子仇视人民，热心地为反革命分子及一切坏分子帮忙的，也不仅是黄绍竑一人。除过黄绍竑外，还有如过去曾经报道过的谭惕吾对王裕丰是一个“生动”的“例子”，罗隆基对陈堃是一个“生动”的“例子”，韩兆鹗对陕西鄠县的反革命暴乱也是一个“生动”的“例子”。
  “例子”如此之多，就不能不使人想想，究竟是什么魔力支持着这些右派分子这样做呢？拿黄绍竑来说，这个右派分子自己原来就是双手沾满了腥血的一贯反共反人民的家伙，所以他一看到反革命分子遭受人民的惩罚，就有“兔死狐悲物伤其类”的感觉，就要利用职权千方百计地为他们“伸冤”，以便拢络他们作为反共的资本。
    不过，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，右派分子想为反革命分子翻案的企图，终归都要破产的，韩国屏的案件，即是明显的事例之一。
