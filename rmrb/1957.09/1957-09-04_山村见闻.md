Mountain Village Encounters
　　Wang Min, Tian Conghuo
We are doctors from the Acupuncture Research Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. From May to July this year, our clinical and basic research personnel formed a rural work team and went to the rural areas of five counties in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi, including Lu'an, Gaoping, Huguan, Tunliu, and Pingshun, to conduct investigations, research, and mobile medical work. As everyone knows, these counties were very barren mountain areas before liberation.
In Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, when we were treating the midwife Han Taiman, she said with great emotion: "In the past, people had to risk their lives when they got sick; now, for illnesses big and small, they have to ask the doctor."
In the mountain villages of several counties, we constantly saw fountain pens on the peddler's poles. We asked one vendor: "Are there many people who want this kind of thing?" He said: "Our county has civil schools in every township, and with the government's vigorous elimination of illiteracy, this item sells the fastest." We couldn't help but say "Oh!" We haven't been to the countryside for less than four or five years, and the changes are really big!
On the mountain roads in the countryside, we saw collective labor production armies everywhere. Small villages with only ten or eight households had newly built houses. In Southwest Village, Mishan Township, Gaoping County, a basketball court was also opened. We were constantly encouraged by the thriving scenes in these remote mountain villages.
The rural work team of our Acupuncture Research Institute went to several counties that were mountainous areas with particularly poor natural conditions, including Pingshun County, which has many stones and little land, and is known as lacking all five elements: "metal, wood, water, fire, and earth." We were not conducting a general survey of rural conditions. In the process of providing diagnosis and treatment for the masses at the clinic and on house calls, and talking with the masses, we gained some understanding of the lives of farmers in the mountainous areas.
What is the grain situation really like?
We first went to the health center in Mishan Township, Gaoping County. We arrived in the afternoon of the first day, and the next morning, a villager from Southwest Village (nicknamed Monk) ran in breathlessly to ask for a doctor. The head of the health center immediately sent someone for a house call. However, the villager explained in an anxious and pleading voice that he hoped the doctor from Beijing would come and take a look. We readily agreed. In order to save time, the villager said that the doctor could sit on the carrier rack of the bicycle to be taken there. As he spoke, he pushed over a brand-new bicycle. In less than half an hour, we arrived at the patient's home. After treating the patient, the villager brought out scallion pancakes and scrambled eggs. We were very surprised: Cooking oil is rationed, and making scallion pancakes and scrambled eggs requires a lot of oil! We said, "If you treat us like this, your whole family will have difficulty getting oil!" He said: "Our oil does not need to be supplied by the state, it is extracted from flax seeds."
Then we talked about grain. He said: "Every year, each person has an average of 380 jin of millet, corn, and wheat, which is enough for both children and adults." We said, "Villager, your life is not bad!" As we spoke, we pointed to his bicycle. He smiled and said: "It's because of collectivization! In the past, we couldn't even afford to hire a donkey to bring a doctor, and we had to beg the families that had donkeys!"
After returning, we ate with Zhao Tingyan, the secretary of the Mishan Township branch, and casually talked about the situation of the farmers. He had a more comprehensive understanding. According to him, Mishan Township entered the high tide of collectivization in the autumn of 1955. Because there was no experience, the situation of the agricultural cooperatives in 1956 was relatively chaotic. The township has a total of twenty-two natural villages, thirteen cooperatives, and two thousand three hundred and ninety-nine households. In 1956, there were a total of seven to eight hundred households that lacked grain. This year, due to increased agricultural production and the development of sideline occupations, the situation has greatly improved. This year, there are only twenty to thirty households in the township that lack grain, accounting for about 1% of the total number of households; sufficient grain has already been prepared to supply them. He continued: "The main problem now is not grain; the central task at present is that primary school graduates cannot pass the middle school entrance exam. Cadres and teachers are arranging and persuading both inside and outside the school."
In Pingshun and Tunliu counties, when we talked to the farmers about the grain issue, the general response was: the retained grain is enough to eat, but there is no surplus.
In these two counties, we gained some understanding of the per-unit area (per mu) yield and grain distribution of five agricultural cooperatives, which can be illustrated by the following table:

		Per Unit Area Yield		Average Grain Distribution Per Person Per Year
		1955	1956		1956
Pingshun "Jin Xing" Cooperative	366 jin	400 jin 7 liang	390 jin
Tunliu "Tong Xin" Cooperative	199 jin	265 jin 8 liang	410 jin
Tunliu "Xian Feng" Cooperative	196 jin	227 jin 5 liang	380 jin
Tunliu "Chang Cun" Cooperative	210 jin	192 jin		380 jin
Tunliu "Huo Xing" Cooperative	206 jin 8 liang	171 jin 6 liang	380 jin

The above five cooperatives are all in mountainous villages with particularly poor natural conditions. The better-run Jin Xing Cooperative and Tong Xin Cooperative have been increasing production year by year. The poorer Chang Cun Cooperative and Huo Xing Cooperative also increased production in the past few years, but the reason for the decrease in production in 1956 was the flood. Xian Feng Cooperative, despite suffering from the disaster, still increased production compared to when it was operating individually. Jin Xing Cooperative, after suffering from a severe hailstorm, still increased production by 34 jin 7 liang per mu compared to 1955.
Regarding grain distribution, regardless of the severity of the disaster or the amount of production, each person must have an average of 380 jin of grain. Particularly productive cooperatives can retain even more. Tong Xin Cooperative reported that in 1956, they distributed 410 jin of grain per person, but in general agricultural cooperatives, because the grain is calculated based on the number of people, those with more children and fewer strong laborers do not lack grain. Only individual strong laborers feel that the grain is a bit tight, but they have more pocket money and there is no major problem.
Due to income from sideline occupations, farmers can spend pocket money at any time without having to wait for the wheat or autumn harvest. Among the mountain villages we visited, there were a variety of sideline occupations, including: flour mills, paper mills, oil mills, silkworm breeding, beekeeping, pig raising, sheep raising, fruit trees, afforestation, coal mining, transportation, and brick kilns. In the agricultural cooperatives we encountered, we did not find any engaged in trafficking. Most farmers have realized that engaging in speculation and trafficking is not honorable.

Cultural Life in Mountain Villages
After finishing our diagnosis and treatment at Huguan Hospital, we went outside for a walk and passed by the gate of the county middle school. We saw the magnificent new school buildings built of stone and the spacious sports field. On the field, male and female athletes were very active. This phenomenon appeared in a remote small county, and we couldn't help but exclaim: "Rare! Rare!" These words aroused the rebuttal of an old villager standing next to us watching the ball game: "Comrade, are you new here? Have you been here before? This middle school was established three years ago, and now there are six or seven hundred students. My eldest grandson is still studying here! There is another middle school in the eastern half of the county that is about the same size as this one!" We asked, "Were there any middle schools here before liberation?" He said: "Don't mention middle schools, even primary schools, there were only three or four higher primary schools in the whole county. Now, every township has higher primary schools!"
In a health survey, we learned that in a mountain village of 100 households in the Xicun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lu'an County, five households are "Five Guarantees" households, and their children still attend middle school. The vast majority of school-age children can enroll in school.
In the five counties we visited, every township has a health center. Each person only pays 2 or 3 jiao of health care fees per year, and they can ask a doctor to come to their home for treatment throughout the year without paying any consultation fees. Larger villages also have resident doctors in the cooperative. An old man named Qin in Wulongtou Village, Huguan County, told us: "In the past, when someone in the family was sick, they had to go to ask a doctor fifteen miles away. Because the mountains are high and the roads are dangerous, they had to lead the doctor's livestock and pay a very expensive pulse fee, but people were still unwilling to come. Now, the doctors come as soon as they are asked, and they also come without being asked. In case of an emergency, they come as soon as they are asked, whether it is windy, rainy, or in the middle of the night."
In Wulongtou Village, which we visited, in the past, 75% of the families could not afford to see a doctor when they got sick, so they had to endure it; if they couldn't endure it, they could only die in vain; 20% of the families borrowed money to find a doctor when they were seriously ill, and sold their land at the end of the year to repay their debts; only 5% of the landlords and rich peasants could see a doctor whenever they were sick. Now, all the farmers enjoy this right.
In this area, many agricultural cooperatives take raising sheep as a sideline occupation, driving the sheep to the hillsides to graze. In the evenings, we could often hear the light and cheerful songs of the shepherds.

Facing the Future with Full Confidence
In addition to providing diagnosis and treatment, we often took the time to sit in the homes of the villagers, chatting about the present and the future.
In Liujiadi, Pingshun, we visited the home of Zhang Mailou, the captain of the sixth production team of the Jin Xing Agricultural Cooperative led by national agricultural labor model Li Shunda. Inside the house, an kerosene lamp was lit, and his children and wife were sitting on the kang, eating "hezi" rice (millet porridge with some noodles added). Zhang Mailou enthusiastically invited us to sit on the kang. We said, "The conditions in Pingshun County are too poor. If the masses were not highly conscious and the labor organization was not good, how could this place reach a grain yield of 400 jin per mu!" Zhang didn't seem happy when he heard our praise. Holding his rice bowl in his hand, he said word by word: "You don't understand our production plan, do you? You think that this poor mountain gully, except for rocks and mountains, cannot open canals, cannot use tractors, and the yield of 400 jin will be the limit, right? Comrades, we are a cooperative with common development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. In terms of afforestation, we plan to sow seeds on 1,200 mu of barren mountains, establish 340 mu of barren mountain nurseries, and 45 mu of flatland nurseries. The above will be completed in the first three years of the second five-year plan. Within three years, we plan to plant 500 to 600 fruit trees, including apple trees, apricot trees, and prickly ash trees. We plan to repair 1,000 mu of river beaches, and we have completed 300 mu, with 100 mu planted with wheat. In order to prevent floods from washing away the wheat fields, we plan to build dams in the small ditches first, gradually moving downwards, and then build dams in the large ditches, intercepting the flood in the ditches, so that the flood in each mountain ditch cannot flow out, and the flood will not be able to show its power." When he got excited, he casually sang a line from a folk song: "Dams in the deep mountain gullies, river beaches become rice fields!" His wife interrupted him joyfully and humorously: "Are you crazy?!" We were stunned by his clear memory and firm confidence. The fact that he remembers so many numbers shows how much he loves the fulfilling life contained in these numbers. He smiled and continued: "Ten years later, we will not only eat hezi rice, but also make scallion pancakes and scrambled eggs. By then, the river beaches will have turned into wheat fields, and the mountainsides will be full of apple trees. With the pine forest on the south mountain, each of our households can receive 1,500 yuan a year just from the income from forestry and fruit trees. When the road is built, the big cars will honk, they are here to pick up apples! Doctor comrades, come and eat the Jin Xing Cooperative's Guoguang apples in ten years!" We were also fascinated by the future he described, and blurted out: "Definitely! Definitely! If the higher authorities don't send us here, we will definitely come at our own expense during the holidays!"
The shepherd's mountain song rang in our ears again:
"The old barren mountains have changed,
The stones are wearing green clothes."
"We have grain to eat and money to spend,
A happy life is collectivized."

    山村见闻
    王敏　田从豁
    我们是中医研究院针灸研究所的医生。今年5月到7月，我们临床和基础研究的人员组成农村工作组到山西长治专区的潞安、高平、壶关、屯留、平顺等五个县的农村中作调查研究和巡回医疗工作。大家都知道，这些县在解放前是非常贫瘠的山区。
    在平顺县川底村我们给接生员韩台满诊病的时候，她很感慨地说：“从前害了病是拿命顶；现在是大小病都要把医生请。”
    在几个县的山村中，不断见到货郎担上放着自来水笔。我们问一个售货人：“要这东西的人多不多？”他说：“咱们县乡乡有民校，再加上政府大力扫除文盲，这东西销路最快。”我们不禁“哦”了一声。四、五年不到农村了，变化真不小！
    在农村的山道上，处处都看到了集体劳动的生产大军。十户八户聚居的小村中，都有新建的房屋。高平县的米山乡西南庄还开辟了篮球场。我们不断被这些偏僻的山村的欣欣向荣的景象鼓舞着。
    我们针灸研究所的农村工作组所到的几个县是自然条件特别差的山区，其中包括，石多地少，号称“金木水火土”五行俱缺的平顺县。我们不是作农村一般情况调查的，在门诊与出诊为群众诊病的过程中和群众谈谈说说，对山区农民生活的面貌，有了一些了解。
    粮食情况究竟如何？
    我们最先去的是高平县米山乡的保健站。头天下午到达，第二天上午有一个西南庄的老乡（小名叫和尚）跑的喘吁吁的来请医生，保健站长即刻派人出诊。然而，老乡带着焦急、恳求的声音解释，希望请北京来的医生去看看。我们义不容辞地答应了。为了争取时间，老乡说可以坐在自行车的货架上把医生带去。说着，就推过来一辆崭新的自行车。不到半小时，我们就到病人的家里。治病以后，老乡端上了葱花油饼和炒鸡蛋。我们很奇怪：食油是定量分配的，烙油饼、炒鸡蛋都要用很多油呀！我们说：“你这样招待我们恐怕你们全家吃油都要困难了！”他说：“我们的油不需要国家供给，是用胡麻子榨出来的。”
    接着谈到粮食。他说：“每年每人平均有小米、玉茭、麦子共三百八十斤，孩子大人匀起来是足够吃的。”我们说：“老乡，你的生活不错呀！”说着，指了指他的自行车。他笑了，说：“合作化嘛！要是从前，请医生牵个毛驴，咱们也没有，还得央求有驴的人家！”
    回来以后，和米山乡支部书记赵庭彦一块吃饭，随便谈起了农民的情况。他了解的比较全面。据他说，米山乡是1955年秋进入了合作化的高潮；因为没有经验，1956年农业社情况比较紊乱。全乡共有二十二个自然村，十三个合作社，二千三百九十九户。1956年共有缺粮户七百到八百户。今年由于农业增产，副业发展，情况大有好转。今年全乡只有二十到三十个缺粮户，占总户数的1％左右；已经准备了充足的粮食供应他们。他接着说：“现在的主要问题，不是粮食；小学毕业考不上中学是目前工作的中心环节。干部和教员正在校内外进行安排和说服教育工作。”
    在平顺、屯留两县，和农民谈到粮食问题，一般反映：留的粮食是足够吃的，不过没有多余的就是了。
    在这两个县中，我们对五个农业合作社的单位面积（每亩）产量及粮食分配，作了一些了解，可用下表来说明：		单位面积产量		每人每年平均所分粮食		1955年  	1956年		1956年平顺“金星”社	366斤		400斤7两	390斤屯留“同心”社	199斤		8两265斤	410斤屯留“先锋”社	196斤		227斤5两	380斤屯留“常村”社	210斤		192斤		380斤屯留“火星”社	206斤8两	171斤6两	380斤
    以上五个社都是在自然条件特别差的山村。办的较好的金星社、同心社是年年增产，较差的常村社和火星社过去几年也在增产，1956年减产的原因是受了水灾。先锋社在受灾的情况下，尚较单干时增产。金星社在受了严重雹灾后，每亩还比1955年增产了三十四斤七两。
    对于粮食分配方面，不论灾情轻重，产量多少，都要平均每口人有三百八十斤的口粮，特别丰产社还可以多留。同心社反映，1956年他们每人分粮食四百一十斤，但一般的农业社，因为按人口计粮，孩子多，壮年劳力少的不缺粮，只有个别劳力强的光身汉觉得粮食有些紧，但是他们手头的零用钱较多，也没有什么大问题。
    由于有副业收入，农民零花钱可以随时支出，不必等麦收、秋收。在我们访问的山村中，副业是多种多样的。有：粉坊、纸场、油坊、养蚕、养蜂、喂猪、养羊、果树、造林、采煤、运输、砖瓦窑等。我们在接触到的农业社中，没有发现兼营贩运的。大多数的农民已经认识到搞投机贩运是不光彩的。
    山村里的文化生活
    我们在壶关医院诊完了病，到外面散步，走过县立中学的门前时，看到那石砌的壮观的新型校舍和广阔的运动场。在球场上，男女健儿活跃非常。这现象出现在荒僻的小县，我们不禁脱口而出：“难得！难得！”这话激起了站在旁边同看打球的一位老乡的反驳：“同志，刚到这里吧？过去来过吗？这个中学是大前年设立的，现在有六七百个学生，我的大孙子还在这里念书哩！东半县还有一个和这所差不多大的中学呢！”我们问：“解放前这里有中学吗？”他说：“别提中学，就是小学，全县才只有三、四个高小。现在呢，乡乡镇镇全有高小了！”
    在卫生调查中，我们了解到潞安县西村农业生产合作社的一百户人家的山村，有五户是“五保”户，他们的子女照样有上中学的，学龄儿童，绝大部分都能入学。
    在我们到过的五个县，乡乡都有保健站，每人每年只缴纳二角、三角的保健费，就可以全年不花任何诊费，请医生到家看病。较大的村庄还有驻社的医生。壶关县五龙头村的一位秦老大爷告诉我们：“过去家里有病人，要到十五里地以外去请医生，因为这里山高路险，要给医生牵着牲口，还要交很贵的脉礼，人家还不愿意来。现在的医生是一请就到，不请也到；有了急病，无论刮风下雨或是深更半夜，也是随请随到。”
    我们到过的五龙头村，过去有75％的人家生病没钱看，只好硬抗着；抗不过，只有白白死去；20％的人家是重病时借钱找医生，在年终卖地还债；只有5％的地主富农，能够随病随医。现在是全体农民享受这种权利了。
    这地区，很多农业社以养羊为副业，将羊赶到山坡上让他们去吃草。我们在傍晚常常可以听到牧羊人的轻松愉快的歌声。
    满怀信心面向未来
    诊病之余，我们常常抽暇到老乡家里坐坐，扯扯现在，也谈谈未来。
    在平顺刘家地，我们到过全国农业劳动模范李顺达领导的金星农业社第六生产大队队长张买楼的家里。屋内点着煤油灯，他们孩子老婆坐在炕上正吃合子饭（小米粥里加些面条）。张买楼热情地把我们让到炕上来。我们说：“平顺县的条件太差了，若不是群众觉悟程度高，劳动组织的好，这地方怎能达到每亩产粮四百斤的水平！”老张听了我们赞扬的话并不高兴。他手托着饭碗，一字一板地说：“你们还不了解我们的生产规划吧？觉得这穷山沟，除了石头就是山，开不了渠，用不上拖拉机，四百斤的产量也就到头了吧？同志，我们是农林牧共同发展的合作社。在造林上，荒山播种一千二百亩，荒山苗圃三百四十亩，平地苗圃四十五亩。以上要在第二个五年计划的前三年完成。果木树在三年内要种五百到六百株，有苹果树、杏树，此外还有花椒树。计划修河滩地一千亩，已经完成了三百亩，有一百亩种上了小麦。为了不使洪水把麦田冲垮，计划先由小沟垒堰，逐渐向下，再在大沟中垒，把洪水截在沟中，作到每个山沟的洪水不能外流，洪水也就发不了威风了。”他说到高兴的地方，随口唱出了一句秧歌：“深山沟里闸谷坊，河滩变成米粮川！”他老婆喜悦而风趣地打断了他：“你发疯了？！”我们为他的清晰的记忆和坚定的信心惊得目瞪口呆。他记得这么多数字，就说明他是多么热爱这数字中包含着的美满的生活。他笑嘻嘻地接着说：十年后，我们不仅吃合子饭，还要烙油饼、摊鸡蛋，到那时，河滩变成了麦子地，山坡上都长满了苹果树，加上南山的松林，我们每年每户光林业果树收入，就可以分到一千五百元。修成了公路，大汽车鸣鸣直叫，它们是来拉苹果的呀！大夫同志，十年后来吃咱们金星社的国光苹果吧！”我们也对他所描述的远景心向神往了，冲口而出： “一定！一定！如上级不派我们来，我们在假期中自费也一定要来一趟！”
    牧羊人的山歌又响在我们的耳畔：
    “老山秃岭变了样，
      石头穿上绿衣裳。”
    “有粮吃，有钱花，
      幸福的生活合作化。”
