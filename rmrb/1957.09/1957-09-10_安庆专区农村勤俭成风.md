    Anqing Special District Rural Areas Develop a Frugal Style

    (Our dispatch) This newspaper reports that a style of diligence and frugality in managing households is forming in the rural areas of Anqing Special District, Anhui Province.

    During June and July this year, Party and government leading organs in Anqing Special District universally carried out propaganda and education on diligence and frugality in managing households in the countryside. About 70% of the four million farmers received education, and a habit of saving and being frugal gradually developed. In previous years during the autumn harvest, farmers would commonly make wine, slaughter pigs, make rice cakes, and eat three meals a day with a lot of labor; it was common for one person to consume more than ten taels of grain per meal. This year, this kind of wasteful phenomenon is no longer seen. According to statistics from some supply and marketing cooperatives, the daily sales of cigarettes and alcohol during this year's autumn harvest decreased by 70% to 80% compared to the same period last year. Many farmers, in order to save grain during the busy farming season, still maintain the past habit of two congee meals and one regular meal. Yu Yinhua, a farmer in Wangjiang County, and her family of three saved six sheng of rice in less than a month; her family plans to save seven dou and four sheng of rice in a year. Farmers in Susong County saved grain, enabling the state to supply one million jin less in July and August.

    Many farmers planned before autumn to build houses and make new clothes after the harvest, and some even blindly pursued good housing and good food. Now, after careful calculation, they have reduced the parts that can be saved. Many farmers have savings. According to statistics from Wangjiang County Bank, farmers' deposits after this year's autumn harvest have increased by 20% compared to the same period last year.

    With the widespread formation of the frugal atmosphere, rural household sideline occupations have also become active. In some areas, the number of pigs raised has increased by one or two times compared to before autumn. Many farm families have also begun to engage in sideline occupations such as growing vegetables, collecting firewood, and spinning thread. It is estimated that the total income from farmers' sideline production in some counties can be increased by five or six times compared to last year.

    Agricultural cooperatives in Anqing Special District have also universally implemented the policy of diligence and frugality in running the cooperatives, reducing the original plans to build houses and purchase unnecessary items. Agricultural cooperatives in Qingyang County stopped building more than 800 cooperative houses and cattle pens, which can save more than 21,000 yuan in total.

    More than 10,000 models of diligence and frugality have emerged in Anqing Special District. Their vivid examples tell people that as long as they pay attention to saving, the grain rations stipulated by the state can be enough to eat, family life can be improved, and agricultural cooperatives can be run better.

    安庆专区农村勤俭成风
    本报讯　安徽省安庆专区农村勤俭持家形成风气。
    今年6、7月间，安庆专区党政领导机关在农村普遍开展了勤俭持家的宣传教育，四百万农民中，70％左右的人受到了教育，省吃俭用之风逐渐养成。往年秋收时候，农民们打酒、杀猪、做米粑、一天三顿干，一顿一人吃用十多两粮食是普遍现象，今年这种浪费现象已经看不到了。据一些供销社统计，在今年秋收期间，每天烟酒的销量比去年同期减少十分之七八。农忙中许多农民为了节约粮食，仍保持过去二粥一饭的习惯。望江县农民余银花家三个人，不到一个月节约了六升米，他家计划一年节约七斗四升米。宿松县农民节约粮食，使国家在7、8月份少供应一百多万斤。
    许多农民在秋前计划秋后兴建房子，添制新衣，有的甚至盲目追求住的好、吃的好，现在都经过仔细算账，削减了可以节省的部分。许多农民有了积蓄。据望江县银行统计，今年秋收后的农民存款，比去年同期已增长20％。
    随着节约风气的普遍形成，农村家庭副业也跟着活跃起来。有的地区养猪比秋前增加一二倍，许多农民家庭都开展了种菜、打柴、捻线等副业。有的县农民副业生产预计总收入可比去年提高五六倍。
    安庆专区各农业社也普遍贯彻了勤俭办社方针，削减了原来兴建房屋、购置不必要的东西的计划。青阳县各农业社停做社屋、牛栏八百多间，共可节约二万一千多元。
    安庆专区已经涌现出了上万的勤俭模范。他们的生动事例告诉人们，只要注意节约，国家规定的口粮可以够吃，家庭生活可以改善，农业社可以办得更好。（江）
