    Supplying Large Quantities of Fertilizer and Artificial Fiber Raw Materials
    Yongli Ning Factory Greatly Expanded
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd dispatch) During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the Nanjing Yongli Jiuda Chemical Industry Company's Ning Factory will expand five new factories, including a sizable coking plant, a new synthetic ammonia plant, a urea plant, a caprolon plant, and a nitric acid plant. At present, the expansion preparation work has already begun, and relevant technical designs are underway. Railway engineering to support the construction will commence next year.
    The products of these five expanded factories, such as urea and nitric phosphate fertilizer, are excellent fertilizers, and caprolon is a raw material for artificial fibers and plastics. After these factories are put into production in 1961 and 1962, they will provide a large amount of fertilizer and raw materials for China's development of agricultural production and the development of the artificial fiber industry. Since most of the above products utilize the factory's existing by-products, the production cost is also relatively low.
    The investment for expanding the above factories is equivalent to six times the investment of the factory's First Five-Year Plan. After all the expanded factories are put into production, the total output value of the factory will exceed the total industrial and handicraft output value of Nanjing City in 1955.

    大量供应肥料和人造纤维原料
    永利宁厂大扩建
    本报南京2日电  南京永利久大化学工业公司宁厂在第二个五年计划期间，将要扩建五个新厂，其中包括具有相当规模的炼焦厂，新的合成氨厂，尿素厂，卡普隆厂以及硝酸厂等。目前扩建准备工作已经开始，有关技术设计正在进行中。配合建设的铁路工程明年动工。
    这五个扩建工厂的产品如尿素、硝酸磷肥都是优良肥料，卡普隆是一种人造纤维和塑料原料。这些厂于1961、1962年分别投入生产后，将对我国发展农业生产和发展人造纤维工业提供大量肥料和原料。由于以上产品大都是利用该厂现有的副产品，因此生产成本也较便宜。
    扩建以上各厂的投资，相当于该厂第一个五年计划投资的六倍，扩建各厂全部投入生产后，该厂总产值将超过南京1955年全市工业、手工业总产值水平。
