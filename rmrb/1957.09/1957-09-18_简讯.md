　　The entire learning process for the students of this institute is funded by the state. The study time is eighteen hours per week.

　　Dalian Institute of Technology Restores Political Counselor System
　　Dalian Institute of Technology has restored the political counselor system this semester, which was abolished a year ago, to strengthen the political and ideological work among university students. The political counseling office is directly led by the institute's CCP organization. Counselors will specifically help students improve their socialist ideological awareness through daily study and life. Now, this counseling office has begun to concentrate its efforts on organizing students to conduct socialist ideological education centered on the anti-Rightist struggle.
　　Dockworkers Go to University
　　Three more dockworkers in Shanghai have entered university.
　　These three dockworkers are Yang Quanxin, Wang Zenggui, and Cheng Lianxian. They have reported to Tongji University, Fudan University, and East China Normal University, respectively. Yang Quanxin and Wang Zenggui were workers at the Yangshupu Loading and Unloading Station, and originally only had a third-grade primary school education. In 1953, they both entered the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle School. Due to their hard work, they both achieved excellent results. Wang Zenggui was also rated as an outstanding student and outstanding Communist Youth League member, and joined the Communist Party of China. Cheng Lianxian was originally a coal shoveler at the Shanghai Second Loading and Unloading Station and has long insisted on amateur cultural learning. In 1955, he was admitted to the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle School.
　　Prior to this, two dockworkers in Shanghai had already been admitted to university. Deng Xinchu went to Wuhan University's Department of Geology last year, and Li Lushan, who was illiterate at the beginning of liberation, is now a third-year student at the Beijing Mining Institute in the new school year.
