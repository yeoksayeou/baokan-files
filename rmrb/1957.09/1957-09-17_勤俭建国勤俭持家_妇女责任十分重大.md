Xinhua News Agency, September 16th—Many delegates attending the Third National Women's Congress of China emphasized in today's discussions that women resolutely support the fundamental policy of "building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily" proposed by this congress. They believe that implementing this policy will more fully unleash the enthusiasm of the vast number of women in building socialism.

The delegates particularly pointed out the special role of women in managing households thriftily. They said that the saying "a good woman makes a good family" precisely illustrates the important position of women in managing the household thriftily. Guan Jiming, acting director of the Anshan City Women's Federation, said in her speech that after the families of workers in Anshan City received education on "building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily" this year, they began to change the trend of competing in extravagance and ostentation, which brought new changes to the market. The supply situation of several major consumer goods, which was tight at the time, was quickly alleviated. According to statistics, in the second quarter of this year, more than 370,000 tons of tap water and more than 230,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved compared with the same period last year. One district saved more than 34,000 jin of grain in June and July, and one street voluntarily handed in 800 chi of surplus cloth coupons in July. The city's deposits in July increased by 400,000 yuan compared with the end of last year. Guan Jiming said that from practice, she deeply realized the great significance of the policy of "building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily," and she guaranteed to earnestly implement this policy in her future work.

Shi Jian, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Federation, cited many vivid examples to prove the great significance of women implementing building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily. She believes that managing the household thriftily is an important aspect of building the nation through thrift and diligence, and it is the basic method of supporting socialist construction and building new socialist families. Shi Jian said that Jiangsu Province began to promote "building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily" to rural women during the "March 8th" festival this year, and this work is currently being vigorously carried out in rural areas. The masses said, "Our country is big, and its foundation is poor, so everyone has a responsibility to be thrifty and diligent."

The delegates widely exchanged experiences in managing households thriftily at the meeting. Shi Jian said that in rural areas, diligence and thrift should not be neglected when implementing managing the household thriftily. At present, the content of managing the household thriftily should focus on saving food and mobilizing the sale of surplus grain. She said that according to the experience of Jiangsu Province, in order to make it easier for women to accept, the slogans of "three preventions" and "three supports" can be put forward. That is, prevent famine years, prevent disasters, prevent birth, old age, illness, and death; be responsible for supporting children, the elderly, and the sick. In addition, various requirements for ensuring self-sufficiency can be proposed according to local conditions. For households with surplus food and clothing, encourage savings and strive to save one year's worth in three to five years; for households that have enough food and clothing, require them not to overspend or be in debt, and strive for savings; for poor households with less food and clothing, require them to be diligent and thrifty, accumulate little by little, and gradually rely on themselves. In this way, households with different economic lives will have their own goals to strive for.

The delegates also believed that planned and rational spending is of great significance. Wang Peizhen, a family member of a worker in Chengde, and Dou Shaoqing, a family member of a railway worker in Datong City, both introduced their experiences in this area. They also suggested that housewives should do it themselves and save all unnecessary expenses. In order to save expenses and materials, Dou Shaoqing made all the clothes and shoes for her family of six herself. This not only saved labor costs but also saved cotton cloth. Last year, her family received a total of twenty zhang of cloth coupons but only used six zhang. Wang Peizhen personally led her children to the mountains to collect firewood and reclaimed wasteland by the river to grow vegetables. Now her family does not need to buy firewood for burning; the cucumbers, eggplants, potatoes, etc. that she grows are not only enough for the whole family to eat but also sold for money to buy clothes for the children.

Wang Xuanhuai, a bank worker in Shanghai, said in his speech that implementing building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily requires the cooperation of all parties, and saving and storage are important links in achieving "both diligence and thrift."

The delegates also pointed out that implementing managing the household thriftily is an arduous task that must be widely publicized and deeply educated. Shi Jian pointed out that some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily, and believe that managing the household thriftily is only applicable to poor households, or that "farmers' lives are already as thrifty as they can be" and other erroneous ideas. Therefore, this is a long-term and arduous socialist ideological education task. At present, the ideological education of building the nation through thrift and diligence, managing the household thriftily should be closely integrated with the socialist great debate to establish new ideas and new customs, and promote that managing the household thriftily is good, which means loving the country and loving the community.

Guo Liwen, director of the Hubei Provincial Women's Federation, said in her speech that they used the method of recalling and comparing to conduct in-depth education for women. At the same time, they mobilized women to hold family meetings to discuss and formulate family plans. They also commended good people and good deeds in managing households thriftily and cultivated models of managing households thriftily.

The full-day today was devoted to general discussions. At the beginning of the meeting, Li Dequan, chairman of the Election Committee of the Congress, made a report on the election of members and alternate members of the Third Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation. Today, a total of twenty-five delegates spoke at the meeting, and fifty-six delegates made written statements.

Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, came to the meeting hall during the congress break to meet with the family members of martyrs, model family members of military personnel, and women representatives from the troops. Gan Siqi warmly shook hands with Rong Guanxiu, Hu Wenxiu, Shi Xiaomei, and Du Sanfang, the mother of martyr Shi Yuanhou, and extended his greetings to them.

Before the start of the afternoon session, the Vietnamese women's delegation met with the Beijing women's delegation, and they presented the Beijing women with an exquisite lacquer painting and other gifts.

　　勤俭建国勤俭持家  妇女责任十分重大
    据新华社16日讯　出席中国妇女第三次全国代表大会的许多代表，今天在大会讨论中强调指出，妇女们坚决拥护这次大会所提出的“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的根本方针，认为贯彻这个方针，将会更充分地发挥广大妇女建设社会主义的积极性。
    代表们特别指出了妇女在勤俭持家中的特殊作用。她们说，所谓“女好一家”，正说明了妇女在勤俭持家中的重要地位。鞍山市妇联代主任管冀明在发言中谈到，鞍山市职工家属今年在受到“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的教育后，开始改变比阔气、比排场的风气，使市场有了新的变化，当时几种主要消费物资的供应紧张情况很快就有了缓和。根据统计，今年第二季度比去年同期节约了自来水三十七万多吨，电二十三万多度。有一个区在6、7两月中就节约了三万四千多斤粮食，有一条街7月份一个月自动交出节余的布票八百尺。7月份全市存款比去年年末增加了四十万元。管冀明说，她从实践中，深刻地体会到“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”这一方针的重大意义，她保证今后在实际工作中切实认真地贯彻执行这个方针。
    江苏省妇联会主任石坚举出很多生动的事例来证明妇女贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家的重大意义。她认为勤俭持家是勤俭建国的一个重要方面，是支持社会主义建设和建设社会主义新家庭的基本方法。石坚说，江苏省在今年“三八”节时，开始向农村妇女进行了“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的宣传，目前农村正在大力开展这一工作。群众说，“我们的国家大，底子穷，勤俭人人有责任”。
    代表们在会上广泛地交流了勤俭持家的经验。石坚说，农村贯彻勤俭持家时，勤与俭二者不可偏废。目前，勤俭持家的内容应以省吃俭用粮食，动员出售余粮为重点。她说，根据江苏省的经验，为了使妇女容易接受，可以提出“三防”“三养”的口号。即防荒年，防灾祸，防生、老、病、死；负责赡养小孩、老人、病人。另外还可因地制宜提出各种保证自给的要求，如对吃用有余的户，提倡积蓄，争取三、五年积余一年；对够吃够用的户，要求他们不透支，不欠债，争取积余；对少吃少用的困难户，要求克勤克俭，积少成多，逐步依靠自己。这样，使各种不同经济生活的农户，都有自己的努力目标。
    代表们还认为，有计划地合理地开支具有重要的意义。承德的职工家属王佩珍和大同市铁路职工家属窦少卿都介绍了这方面的经验。她们还提出，家庭妇女们应该亲自动手，节省一切不必要的开支。窦少卿为了节省开支和节约物资，全家六口人的衣服、鞋子都是自己做。这样不但省工钱，还能节约棉布。去年她家共领了二十丈布票，只用了六丈。王佩珍亲自动手带着孩子到山上去打柴，在河边上开荒种菜。现在她家不用买柴烧；她种的黄瓜、茄子、土豆等，除了供全家吃用，还卖了钱给孩子添了衣服。
    上海的银行工作者王宣淮在发言中说，贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家需要各方面的配合，节约和储蓄是作到“两勤”的重要环节。
    代表们还指出，贯彻勤俭持家是一个艰巨的任务，必须广泛宣传，深入地进行教育。石坚指出，有些干部对勤俭建国、勤俭持家的重要意义认识不足，认为勤俭持家只适用于困难户，或者认为“农民生活已勤俭到顶了”等等错误想法。因此，这是一个长期艰巨的社会主义思想教育工作。在目前应该将勤俭建国、勤俭持家的思想教育和社会主义大辩论密切结合进行，树立新思想新风气，宣传勤俭持家好，就是爱国爱社好。
    湖北省妇联会主任郭力文在发言中说，她们用回忆对比的方法，向妇女进行了深入的教育。同时，发动妇女召开家庭会议，讨论和制定家庭计划。并且表扬勤俭持家的好人、好事，培养勤俭持家模范。
    今天全天进行大会讨论。会议开始时，大会选举委员会主任委员李德全作了关于选举全国妇联第三届执行委员会委员、候补委员的报告。今天，共有二十五位代表在会上发言，还有五十六位代表作了书面发言。
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇在大会休息时到会场同代表中的烈属、军属模范和部队中的妇女代表会见。甘泗淇亲热地和戎冠秀、胡文秀、施小妹以及史元厚烈士的母亲杜三芳等握手，向她们问好。
    下午大会开始以前，越南妇女代表团会见了北京妇女代表团，她们送给北京妇女一幅精致的漆画和其它礼物。
