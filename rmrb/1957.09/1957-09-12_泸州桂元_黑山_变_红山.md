    Luzhou Longan's "Black Mountain" Turns into "Red Mountain"
    Luzhou longan, famous throughout the country, has had another bumper harvest this year. According to statistics from relevant departments, the output is about 2 million catties, an increase of more than 30% compared with 1956.
    Longan trees generally bear fruit every other year. The year they bear fruit is called "Red Mountain," and the year they don't is called "Black Mountain." According to general rules, Luzhou longan was "Red Mountain" last year, so this year should have been "Black Mountain" and not bear fruit. However, because of the favorable rainfall last winter and this spring, the fruit trees did not suffer from frost and snow. In addition, after agricultural cooperativization, fruit farmers pruned, fertilized, and removed pests from the longan trees, so this year's "Black Mountain" has turned into "Red Mountain." At present, local commercial departments have begun purchasing and processing. Consumers everywhere will be able to eat delicious Luzhou longan before National Day. (Zhou Shunan)

    泸州桂元“黑山”变“红山”
    驰名全国的泸州桂元，今年又获丰收。据有关部门统计，产量约为二百多万斤，较1956年增产30％多。
    桂元树本是隔年结果一次，结果的那年叫“红山”，不结果的那年叫“黑山”。按一般规律，泸州桂元去年是“红山”，今年应该是“黑山”不结果。但是，因为去冬今春的雨水调和，果树没有遭受霜雪，加之，农业合作化以后，果农们对桂元树进行了整枝、施肥、除虫，以致今年的“黑山”变成了“红山”。目前，当地商业部门，已开始收购和加工工作。各地消费者在国庆节以前就可以吃到味美的泸州桂元。　（周蜀南）
