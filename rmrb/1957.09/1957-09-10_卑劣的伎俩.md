    Base Tricks
    Not long ago, the embassies of Arab countries in Western Europe received a French-language newspaper published in Cairo, "Egyptian Progress." From the layout to the headlines, there seemed to be nothing to suspect about this newspaper. However, a closer look at the content, especially one page, was simply astonishing.
    On this page, there was a cartoonish "photo" of Egyptian President Nasser, which was actually an ugly image of the Egyptian president, looking ferocious. Beside the photo was a banner headline: "Abdel Nasser's Speech on the Sinai War." However, the content was not about the Sinai War at all; the page was full of slanders and attacks on President Nasser and the Soviet Union.
    This was indeed a mystery - an Egyptian newspaper attacking its own head of state. However, the mystery was quickly solved. A few days later, these Arab embassies received a copy of "Egyptian Progress" with the same date. These two copies of the same day's "Egyptian Progress," received at different times, had vastly different content: the later one had no articles attacking President Nasser and the Soviet Union, nor this strange photo. Careful Arab diplomats got the answer from the postmarks on the two newspapers. It turned out that the first newspaper was mailed from Wiesbaden, Bonn, and Mainz in the American-occupied zone of West Germany, while the second one was actually mailed from Cairo.
    The truth was then revealed. This newspaper was clearly forged by the American spy agency.
    The intention of the American spy agency in forging the Egyptian newspaper is obvious. The United States wants to isolate Egypt and has been painstakingly trying to undermine Egypt's relations with other friendly countries, especially Egypt's relations with the Soviet Union. At the same time, Washington is using this means of forging newspapers and documents to attack President Nasser's prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world. In August of this year, the Egyptian weekly "Today's News" revealed that these imperialists dared to forge a so-called "Secret Speech of Nasser to the Commanders of the Egyptian Army," attempting to make other Arab countries believe the myth that Egypt was going to "invade" them.
    However, the black hand of these Washington schemers was immediately caught. The "Egyptian Progress" of August 12 pointed out that the fact that the American spy agency forged Egyptian newspapers and documents "fully proves that Egypt's enemies are trying to harm Egypt by extremely despicable means."
    In fact, this base and shameless trick of the United States is not an occasional discovery, but is often heard of. People remember very well that the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret service in Hong Kong also forged China's "People's Daily" and "Workers' Daily." The method is almost exactly the same as forging the Egyptian newspaper. For example, they forged the People's Daily of October 26, 1956. Most of the newspaper's layout was completely reproduced, but one of the pages was not the result of the labor of the People's Daily reporters and editors, but was "undertaken" by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in Hong Kong. These shameless people borrowed the name of the "People's Daily" and did their best to provoke Sino-Soviet relations!
    From this, it can be seen to what level of depravity the behavior of the U.S. ruling clique has fallen on the international political stage. But the more they use these vile methods, the more they bring misfortune upon themselves. Their actions precisely show that the deceptive tricks of propaganda machines such as the "Voice of America" and the "United States Information Service" have all gone bankrupt. Therefore, they have to resort to forging Egyptian and Chinese newspapers and documents, engaging in deception everywhere. However, people very easily catch these political swindlers who forge newspapers and documents, and make them stink. (Dan)

### 卑劣的伎俩

    卑劣的伎俩
    不久前，阿拉伯国家驻西欧的使馆收到了一份开罗出版的法文报纸“埃及进步报”。这份报纸的外表，从排版到标题似乎没有什么可以令人怀疑的地方，但细看内容，特别是有一个版，简直令人吃惊。
    在这一版上，登了一张埃及总统纳赛尔的漫画式的“相片”，实际上是丑化了的埃及总统的形象，看上去很凶恶。在相片旁边辅之以通栏大标题：“阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔关于西奈战役的演说”。但是，内容却丝毫也不是关于西奈战役的，满纸都是对于纳赛尔总统和苏联的污蔑和攻击。
    这确是一个谜——埃及报纸竟然攻击自己国家的元首。然而很快这个谜就被揭开了。几天之后，这些阿拉伯国家的使馆收到了一份同一日期的“埃及进步报”。这两份前后收到的同一天的“埃及进步报”内容竟大不相同：后来收到的那一份报纸根本没有攻击纳赛尔总统和苏联的文章，也没有这张奇怪的相片。细心的阿拉伯外交家们从两份报纸所盖的邮戮上得到了谜底。原来前一份报纸是从西德美国占领区威斯巴登、波恩和美因等地寄出的；而后一份才是真正从开罗寄出的。
    事情的真相于是大白了。这份报纸明明是美国间谍机关所伪造的。
    美国间谍机关伪造埃及报纸，其用心是昭然若揭的。美国要把埃及孤立起来，处心积虑地破坏埃及同其它友好国家的关系，首先是埃及和苏联的关系。同时，华盛顿又通过这种伪造报纸和文件的手段，打击纳赛尔总统在埃及和整个阿拉伯世界的威望。今年8月间，埃及“今日消息”周刊揭露了这些帝国主义分子竟敢伪造所谓“纳赛尔对埃及军队司令官的秘密演说”的文件，企图使其他阿拉伯国家相信埃及将要“侵略”它们的神话。
    然而，华盛顿阴谋家的这只黑手，马上就被抓住了。8月12日的“埃及进步报”指出，美国间谍机关伪造埃及报纸和文件的事实，“充分地证明了埃及的敌人企图以极端卑鄙的手段来损害埃及”。
    其实，美国的这种卑劣无耻的伎俩，已经不是偶然发现，而是时有所闻的了。人们记得很清楚，美蒋在香港的特务机关也曾伪造过中国的“人民日报”和“工人日报”。其手法几乎同伪造埃及报纸完全相同。例如它们伪造了1956年10月26日的人民日报，报纸的大部分版面完全是翻制的，而其中有一个版并不是人民日报记者和编辑劳动的结果，却是美蒋在香港的特务间谍们所一手“代劳”的。这批无耻之徒竟借了“人民日报”之名、竭尽其挑拨中苏关系的能事！
    由此可以看出，美国统治集团在国际政治舞台上所表现的行为已经堕落到何等下流的程度。但是，他们越是采用这种下流的手段，越是使他们自己大倒其霉。他们的这种行径恰恰足以说明，“美国之音”、“美国新闻处”之类的宣传机器的骗人勾当都已经破产，因此他们不得不借助于伪造埃及、中国的报纸和文件，到处招摇撞骗。可是，人们非常容易地就抓住了这类伪造报纸和文件的政治骗子，并且使他们臭气熏天。（丹）
