Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 5th – At the Fifth Session of the First Guangxi Provincial People's Congress, the people's representatives crushed an anti-Communist, anti-socialist multi-faceted alliance that dreamed of "feudal division of the world" in Guangxi Province. Some ringleaders of this multi-faceted alliance have begun to surrender their weapons to the people.

The commander of this multi-faceted alliance was Hu Mingshu, vice chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy's Guangxi Provincial Committee. The main generals were Lin Huanping, a member of the China Democratic League, Li Wenzhao, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Wan Zhongwen. They formed separate groups that were interconnected, each with a vanguard of strategists, who roped in all the rightist elements, both within and outside the Communist Party, in the province's cultural, educational, journalistic, and publishing circles.

In the sixteen days of continuous exposure and great debate, these rightist elements admitted that their "feudal division of the world" blueprint was designed during the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Conference in May this year, when they launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party. According to their plan, Hu Mingshu was to be promoted to Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles (originally Vice Chairman), Lin Huanping recommended himself as Director of the Provincial Culture Bureau, Vice Chairman of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Vice President of Guangxi Normal College (originally Chairman of the Chinese Department), and Li Wenzhao was assigned to be Deputy Director of the Culture Bureau and Vice Chairman of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. According to Wan Zhongwen, after the rightist elements seized leadership in the literary and art circles locally, they further plotted to take over the entire situation, even making arrangements for the "Chairman" of the People's Congress of the yet-to-be-established Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. As soon as the rectification campaign began, Lin Huanping believed that "the Communist Party had encountered insurmountable difficulties, could not carry on, and had to seek the support of the democratic parties." Therefore, they secretly plotted to launch a major attack on the Communist Party, taking advantage of the opportunity for speaking out freely at the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Conference.

At the Propaganda Conference, Hu Mingshu, Lin Huanping and others viciously put forward the reactionary slogan of "uniting all democratic parties" to challenge and scold the Communist Party. The rightist elements scolded the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee for only being able to lead agricultural production and not being capable of leading the cultural and educational front. Led by Hu Mingshu with a large number of troops, they fiercely rebuked Chen Manyuan, the former first secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, for his opening remarks at the propaganda conference that "only talked about achievements and did not mention shortcomings," slandering the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee for covering up internal contradictions and hindering free airing of views, and attempting to force Chen Manyuan to redeliver his speech and state his position. Lin Huanping and Li Wenzhao, who attacked the Guangxi Daily and the Culture Bureau, threatened to uncover these "big lids" that suppressed the free airing of views in the literary and art circles. Taking advantage of this chaotic opportunity, Wan Zhongwen wanted bourgeois intellectuals to rise up and "assimilate" the Communist Party, proposing that democratic parties should "sit on an equal footing" with the Communist Party. Wan Zhongwen also drafted a so-called "new democratic personnel system" for the leaders of the Guangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, attempting to bring it to the National People's Congress for approval, with the aim of gradually disintegrating the people's regime and ultimately replacing the proletarian dictatorship with a bourgeois dictatorship.

Through exposure and debate, these rightist elements admitted that their activities were anti-Communist and anti-socialist, and that they had close connections with each other. However, on the other hand, they described these activities as accidental and spontaneous. Lin Huanping said that he sought the position of Director of the Culture Bureau simply because he liked the Culture Bureau's beautiful Jeep. After the representatives refuted his lies with conclusive facts, he had to admit that he had political ambitions. Wan Zhongwen repeatedly said at the meeting that he was influenced by the residual thinking of the "middle-of-the-road line" and bitterly scolded himself for being used by others. The representatives turned over his thirty-year history of anti-Communist and anti-people ugliness, asking whether his long-term reliance on the traitor Wang Jingwei before liberation and his repeated suggestions to Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi to oppose the Communist Party were also "middle-of-the-road line" thinking? They also asked whether he wanted to become the Director of the Higher Education Bureau because he was being used by others? Wan Zhongwen was refuted until his face turned red and white, and he was speechless. Hu Mingshu attempted to attribute the root of his anti-Communist thinking entirely to a misunderstanding of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." The representatives pointed out that Hu Mingshu's view of this policy as the Communist Party being "weak and easy to bully" or "automatically dividing some of the world" was not accidental, nor was it a misunderstanding, but rather his class nature. In the end, Hu Mingshu had to bow his head and confess his crimes to the people.

    打垮梦想分封天下的右派联盟
    广西人代会十六天大辩论驳倒胡明树林焕平万仲文
    新华社南宁5日电　在广西省第一届人民代表大会第五次会议上，人民代表们打垮了一个梦想在广西省“分封天下”的反共反社会主义多角联盟。这个多角联盟的部分头目已开始向人民交械投降。
    这个多角联盟的统帅是中国民主促进会广西省副主任委员胡明树，主将是民盟成员林焕平、民革成员李文钊和万仲文。他们各成集团又互有联系，每个集团都有一班先锋军师，网罗了省内文教界、新闻界和出版界所有的共产党内和共产党外的右派分子。
    在连续十六天的揭露和大论战中，这些右派分子承认了他们“分封天下”的草图，是在今年5月中共广西省委宣传会议上疯狂地向共产党进攻的时候设计出来的。按照他们的计划，胡明树被推举为广西省文联主席（原为副主席），林焕平自荐为省文化局局长、文联副主席和广西师范学院副院长（原为中文系主任），李文钊被分配为文化局副局长和文联副主席。据万仲文交代，右派分子在局部夺取文艺界的领导后，进而图谋全盘，连还没有成立的广西僮族自治区的人民代表大会的“委员长”，也作过安排。整风一开始，林焕平便认为“共产党遇到了不可克服的困难，搞不下去了，不得不求助于民主党派的支持”。于是，他们密谋趁着中共广西省委宣传会议上大鸣大放的机会向共产党大举进攻。
    在宣传会议上，胡明树、林焕平等恶毒地提出“各民主党派联合起来”的反动口号，向共产党挑战骂战。右派分子骂中共广西省委只能领导农业生产，没有能力领导文教战线。并由胡明树统率大部兵马，杀气腾腾地斥责中共广西省委前任第一书记陈漫远在宣传会议上的开幕词 “只讲成绩，不谈缺点，”污蔑中共广西省委掩盖内部矛盾，阻挠大鸣大放，并企图强迫陈漫远重新致词，表明态度。向广西日报和文化局进攻的林焕平和李文钊，扬言要揭开这两个压制文艺界鸣放的“大盖子”。万仲文趁着这个乌烟瘴气的机会，要资产阶级知识分子起来“同化”共产党，提出民主党派要和共产党“平起平坐”。万仲文还为广西省民革领导人草拟了一份所谓“新的民主的人事制度”，企图带到全国人民代表大会上来通过，目的是逐步瓦解人民政权，最后以资产阶级专政代替无产阶级专政。
    经过揭露和论战，这些右派分子承认他们的活动是反共反社会主义的，并且互相有密切的联系，但另一方面却又把这些活动说成是偶然的和自发的。林焕平就说他谋取文化局局长这一职务，只是因为看中文化局有辆漂亮的小吉普车。代表们以确凿的事实驳倒了他的谎言后，他不得不承认他有政治野心。万仲文在会上口口声声说他是受了“中间路线”残余思想的影响，痛骂自己不该为别人所利用。代表们翻开了他三十年来反共反人民的丑恶历史，问他在解放前长期投靠汉奸汪精卫，多次给李宗仁、白崇禧献策反共是否也是“中间路线”思想？又问他想当高教局局长是否是被别人利用了？万仲文被驳得脸上时红时白，哑口无言。胡明树企图把他的反共思想根源，完全说成是对“长期共存、互相监督”方针有错误的理解。代表们指出，胡明树把这个方针看成是共产党“力弱可欺”或者是“自动把天下分了一些出来”，都不是偶然的，也不是什么错误的理解，而是他的阶级本性。胡明树最后不得不低头向人民认罪。
