According to the Shanxi Daily: The Ping Shun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party implemented a working method of organizing county-level leading organs and leading cadres to collectively go down to the countryside (only a few necessary cadres were left in the county organs to keep watch, and the offices moved to the countryside with the leading comrades) for circuit office work, achieving good results. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party transmitted the Ping Shun County Committee's "Summary Report on Moving Organ Offices to the Countryside to Implement Circuit Office Work." The Provincial Committee believes that this new working method of Ping Shun County is a very good way to implement the Party's mass line after the realization of advanced cooperation in rural areas. Doing so is extremely beneficial to overcoming bureaucratic and subjective styles of work. The Provincial Committee suggests that all counties in the province emulate the Ping Shun County Committee's method and organize at least one collective downward mobility for circuit office work each year.

The Proposal of a New Working Method

The working method of organizing county-level organ cadres to collectively go down to the countryside for circuit office work was proposed by the Ping Shun County Committee in November of last year, based on the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in order to change the leadership style, closely connect with the masses, and adapt to the requirements of the new situation and new tasks of cooperation. After the report of Chairman Mao "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was conveyed in mid-April of this year, the County Committee, after careful study, believed that adopting this new working method would be of great benefit to overcoming bureaucracy and subjectivism, closely connecting with the masses, sharing weal and woe with the masses, correctly handling contradictions among the people, mobilizing all positive factors, promoting a bumper harvest, and consolidating cooperatives. At the same time, it analyzed the current favorable conditions, such as the fact that telephones had been installed in all townships, upper and lower levels and left and right could be contacted at any time, a large number of cadres had been transferred downwards, the grassroots leadership had been strengthened, and members of the County Committee or deputy ministers were assigned to oversee areas of work in each key point. It then made a resolution and actively organized the work, starting the collective downward mobility for circuit office work on April 27.

Organization of Forces and Specific Activities

The working teams were organized based on the principles of considering both the central tasks and the overall system, and balancing the work of the organs and the work in the countryside. In addition to maintaining a certain force in the organs to persist in daily work, the main force was drawn out to go deep down to carry out work (generally, the force going down to the countryside accounted for about two-thirds). This time, 114 cadres were organized to collectively go down to the countryside, of which more than 60% were cadres at the section and bureau chief level or above. They were organized into nine working groups and one office (accompanying the First Secretary of the County Committee) to carry out work under the unified leadership of the County Committee. Short-term training was conducted before departure to clarify the purpose, tasks, and methods of going down to the countryside so that everyone would be clear about what to do.

The working groups completely changed the old methods of relying on meetings and statistical tables, and persisted in the mass line. The general steps taken by each group after arriving in a township were: (1) first explain the work tasks and requirements to the township cadres; (2) go deep into reality (fields, homes, schools) to labor together with the peasants and discover problems; (3) use various forms and occasions to widely convey the spirit of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" to cadres and the masses, boldly promote democracy, and mobilize the masses to put forward opinions and criticisms; (4) help township and cooperative cadres analyze, study, and solve the problems raised by the masses; (5) help each township revise its ten-year long-term construction plan, revise the bumper harvest plan, establish various relevant systems, and promote various tasks.

During the collective downward mobility for circuit office work, how was the principle of collective leadership of the County Committee upheld? (1) In addition to each of the three secretaries leading a group, they spent two-thirds of their time in collective activities, inspecting the work in each township, personally visiting 46 of the 50 townships in the county, understanding the situation, and providing timely guidance; (2) the office accompanying the secretaries spent half of its time contacting each working group, grasping the situation and reporting to the County Committee; (3) a telephone conference of the County Standing Committee was convened once in each batch to analyze the situation and solve problems; (4) typical examples were created and promoted throughout the county through circulars, broadcasts, and small newspapers; (5) the County Committee took some time to handle official documents, and documents from higher levels were quickly delivered to the countryside by messengers for the County Committee to read and handle.

Good Results

The spirit of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was widely publicized and implemented both inside and outside the Party. According to statistics, more than 35,000 people directly heard the County Committee's conveyance of Chairman Mao's report, accounting for 59% of the total number of people who should have received education, and visited 4,763 peasant households, accounting for 16% of the total number of households. They conducted heart-to-heart talks and interviews with 9,770 people. Through these activities, based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's report, a deep class education was carried out among the Party members and the masses, explaining the nature of the two types of contradictions and their mutual relationship, criticizing the tendency of only paying attention to contradictions among the people and neglecting class contradictions, thereby raising the class consciousness of cadres and the masses, and exposing and cracking down on the rumors and sabotage of landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements. Through these activities, democracy was also fully promoted, and the masses were mobilized to carry out criticism and self-criticism, put forward opinions, and talk about their thoughts. A total of 12,448 criticisms and suggestions were put forward throughout the county, and about 80% of them were resolved on the spot.

Summarize experience, accept lessons, and further clarify the direction of building mountainous areas. In this collective circuit work, two different typical examples, Yangjingdi and Yuxia Pass, were mainly discovered, and comparative publicity was carried out by grasping these two typical examples to help the townships revise their construction plans. In the past six years, the Yangjingdi Township has strengthened its leadership and conscientiously implemented the policy of comprehensive development of production, under the premise of ensuring the completion of the current production increase tasks, and has invested more than 100,000 basic construction projects over the years, ensuring the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries. Therefore, although the township suffered a major disaster in 1956, its total income still increased compared to the past. On the contrary, the Yuxia Pass Party Branch did not have a clear idea of the comprehensive development of mountainous areas, and still led large-scale production in the way it used to lead small-scale production, so there was not much change. Based on the above two different typical examples, when the County Committee helped the townships revise their construction plans, it especially emphasized the comprehensive development of diversified economies under the premise of developing grain production, and helped the townships study the five major problems of water, fertilizer, industry, coal, and roads that must be solved accordingly. After the ten-year construction plan was revised, the cadres and the masses reflected: the direction is clear, the enthusiasm is high, confidence is increased, and there are methods.

Revise production plans, promote bumper harvests, solve specific problems, and consolidate cooperatives. After the working groups arrived in the townships, they started by inspecting and promoting bumper harvests. In response to the specific situations and existing problems in each cooperative, in addition to focusing on correcting the two emotions of blind optimism and passive pessimism in grain production, and educating cadres to implement the ideological work of bumper harvests throughout, they also helped the townships and cooperatives solve a large number of specific problems and improved all aspects of their work. They helped 106 cooperatives revise their production increase plans to make them more in line with reality, thereby encouraging the masses' confidence in increasing production. They helped cooperatives solve a series of problems in labor and financial management, such as improving labor management in 35 cooperatives, improving livestock breeding management in 50 cooperatives, and rectifying financial work in 35 cooperatives. Third, in disaster-stricken areas, the County Committee put forward the slogan "Make up for wheat crop failures with autumn crops, and make up for reduced mountain products with sideline industries," and specifically helped the townships and cooperatives study methods of production and disaster relief. Fourth, conscientiously help cooperatives improve fertilizer accumulation methods and solve fertilizer problems. For example, the Xingcheng Worker-Peasant Cooperative did not build pigsties for raising pigs or lay mats in the pens for livestock. Last year, only more than 22,000 dan of fertilizer were accumulated from cattle, sheep, and pig manure. After research and assistance, if regular and quantitative matting and manure removal are implemented in the future, more than 180,000 dan of fertilizer can be accumulated annually. Fifth, tap water sources and draw river water up the mountains. In the past few years, there were only more than 1,000 mu of irrigated land in the county. This time, the potential of water was explored with practical help in eight townships including Yanggao, Shicheng, and Wangqu, and a total of 6,000 to 10,000 mu of irrigated land can be added. Sixth, promote flood prevention and disaster relief work. During the inspection, it was found that 15 villages and 208 households were living in danger of flooding, and flood prevention protection and relocation work were organized in a timely manner.

Learning, Rectifying, and Changing Simultaneously

It is a practical education for the County Committee and all cadres, and also a profound rectification campaign. In nearly 40 days of activity, not only has it greatly promoted various aspects of work, but it has also deeply educated cadres and enriched leadership. The County Committee and all the comrades who went down to the countryside unanimously felt that moving the office to the countryside for circuit office work is a unified practice of learning, rectifying, and changing simultaneously. The most prominent gains in this regard are: (1) a general and in-depth understanding of the 51 townships, 230 cooperatives, and 518 natural villages in the county, enabling the leadership to have a relatively comprehensive understanding of the natural conditions, production, living conditions, and ideological conditions of Party members and the masses in various regions. This provides a basis for formulating plans and guiding production, and can avoid and reduce the occurrence of bureaucracy and subjectivism.

Close the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the masses said: "The old cadres from the land reform period have come down again." This time, the cadres who participated in the collective downward mobility for circuit office work not only visited the villages and had cordial conversations with the masses, but also worked together with the masses. According to incomplete statistics, they participated in more than 790 working days, which not only further close the relationship between cadres and the masses, but also strengthened the labor concept of cadres. The masses reflected and said: "The old cadres from the land reform period have come down again." "The cadres cultivated by Chairman Mao are both civilized and military, working during the day and working at night." The masses of Guangwu said: "For the sake of a bumper harvest, the County Committee and the farmers work together, which is really a good cadre trained by Chairman Mao. We must also be good farmers cultivated by Chairman Mao, and work together to build a new socialist countryside." At the same time, it also educated the township and cooperative cadres to recognize the importance of participating in production and leading production, and also overcome the erroneous thinking of some young people who despise physical labor.

Unified leadership, mutual cooperation, and overcoming the past phenomenon of contradictions between central work and systematic work. In the past, the contradiction between central work and systematic work was an old problem. The Party Committee transferred cadres to go down to the countryside to carry out central work, and some system leaders had opinions. They mistakenly believed that "the center is the Party and government, and the system is themselves." This time, under the unified leadership of the County Committee, the working groups were organized, coordinated in action, and fully cooperated. After arriving in the countryside, they had a comprehensive understanding, unified research, and unified solutions. Finally, everyone was very satisfied. Some said: "In the past, it was a matter of issuing orders from all directions and everyone intervening; this time, the collective went down to the countryside, which not only carried out the system, but also served the center." In particular, the township and cooperative cadres were very satisfied. They said: "In the past, cadres went down to the countryside and raised problems, but they could not be solved in time. This time, the collective went down to the countryside, and most of the problems raised can be solved." This also further strengthened the relationship between higher and lower levels.

Effectively strengthen the collective leadership system of the Party Committee, adhere to the principle of collective leadership and individual division of labor, and give full play to the role of collective leadership. It overcomes the phenomenon that in the past, some members of the County Committee went down to the countryside, and some members stayed in the organs to persist in their work, so that individual responsibility and collective leadership could not be combined, and major issues could not be studied and resolved in a timely manner. This time, they concentrated on one area, held regular research and discussions. In 40 days, the Standing Committee held five telephone conferences and the plenary meeting of the County Committee twice. Major issues in the work were all discussed and resolved collectively. At the same time, it also reduced bureaucratic style. According to statistics from the County Committee and the County People's Committee, in the 40 days that the office was moved to the countryside, 89 official documents were issued, a decrease of 29% compared to the same period in the past. The township and cooperative cadres were very satisfied.

In short, moving the office to the countryside for circuit office work has greatly enriched the leadership, deeply educated the cadres and the masses, widely discovered and solved problems, closely connected with the masses, promoted bumper harvests, and consolidated the cooperatives. Therefore, the County Committee is satisfied, the cadres are happy, and the masses are welcome.

    平顺县领导机关坚持群众路线
    干部集体下乡巡回办公效果良好
    中共山西省委批转平顺县委报告，建议各县仿行
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：中共平顺县委实行县级领导机关和领导干部集体下乡（县里各机关只留少数必要的干部守门，办公室随着领导同志搬到乡下）巡回办公的工作方法，取得了良好的效果。日前中共山西省委批转了平顺县委“关于把机关办公室搬到农村实行巡回办公的总结报告”。省委认为，平顺县的这一新的工作方法，在农村已经实现了高级合作化之后，是贯彻执行党的群众路线的很好的一种方法，这样做对克服官僚主义和主观主义的作风是有极大好处的。省委建议全省各县仿效平顺县委的办法，每个县在每一年内，至少组织一次集体下乡巡回办公。
    新工作方法的提出
    组织县级机关干部集体下乡巡回办公的工作方法，是平顺县委根据党的八届二中全会精神，为了改变领导作风，密切联系群众，适应合作化的新形势和新任务的要求，于去年11月间就提出来，并发动各机关干部进行了酝酿讨论的。今年
  4月中旬传达了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告以后，县委又经过慎重研究，认为采取这一新的工作方法，对于克服官僚主义、主观主义，密切联系群众，与群众同甘共苦，正确处理人民内部矛盾，调动一切积极因素，推动大丰收，巩固合作社有极大好处；同时分析了当前乡乡已经通了电话，上下左右可以随时取得联系，大批干部下放，基层领导已经充实，各基点派有县委委员或副部长分管一片工作的种种有利条件，随即作出决议，并积极进行组织，于4月27日即开始了集体下乡巡回办公的工作。
    力量组织和具体活动
    本着中心与系统、机关与下乡相互兼顾的原则，组织工作队伍。除机关保持一定力量坚持日常工作外，抽出主要力量深入下去进行工作（一般下乡力量占到三分之二左右）。这次组织集体下乡的干部有一百一十四名，其中科、局长以上干部占60％以上，共组成九个工作组，一个办公室（随同县委第一书记），在县委统一领导下进行工作。出发前进行了短期的训练，使大家明确下乡的目的、任务和方法，做到心中有数。
    工作组完全改变过去凭开会、表格统计的老一套的方法，坚持了群众路线。各组，每到一乡之后的大体步骤是：（一）先向乡干部讲明工作任务和要求；（二）深入实际（田间、家庭、学校），同农民一块劳动，发现问题；（三）利用各种形式和场合，广泛向干部、群众传达毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的精神，大胆发扬民主，发动群众提出意见和批评；（四）帮助乡、社干部把群众提出的问题进行分析、研究和解决；（五）帮助各乡修订十年远景建设规划，修订大丰收计划，订出各项有关制度，推动各项工作。
    在集体下乡巡回办公期间，如何坚持了县委集体领导的原则？（一）三个书记除各领导一组外，抽出三分之二时间集体活动，逐乡巡视工作，全县五十个乡亲自到过四十六乡，了解情况，及时指导；（二）随同书记的办公室用一半时间与各工作组联系，掌握情况向县委汇报；（三）在每一批中间召开一次县常委电话会议，分析情况，解决问题；（四）创造典型，利用通报、广播、小报，推广到全县；（五）县委抽出一定时间承办公文，上级文件由交通员迅速送达乡下，县委阅读办理。
    良好的效果
    在党内外广泛地宣传贯彻了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的精神。据统计，有三万五千余群众直接听到了县委对毛主席报告的传达，占应受教育群众总数的59％，登门访问了农户四千七百六十三家，占总户数的16％。和九千七百七十人进行了谈心和访问。通过这些活动，根据毛主席报告的精神，向党内外群众进行了一次深入的阶级教育，讲明两类矛盾的性质及其互相的关系，批判了只注意人民内部矛盾，忽视阶级矛盾的偏向，从而提高了干部、群众的阶级觉悟，揭发和打击了地主、富农和坏分子的造谣和破坏。通过这些活动，还充分发扬民主，发动群众开展批评与自我批评，提意见，谈心思，全县共提出批评、建议一万二千四百四十八条，并就地解决了其中的80％左右。
    总结经验，接受教训，进一步明确了建设山区的方向。在此次集体巡回工作中，主要发现了羊井底和玉峡关两个不同的典型，并抓住这两个典型进行对比宣传，帮助各乡修订了建设计划。羊井底乡办社六年来，由于党支部加强领导，认真贯彻了全面发展生产的方针，在保证完成当前增产任务的前提下，几年来投入基本建设工十万余个，保证了农、林、牧、副业的全面发展。因之，该乡虽于1956年遭受特大灾害，但总收入仍比以往提高。相反，玉峡关党支部对于建设山区全面发展的思想不明确，仍以过去领导小生产的方式来领导大生产，因此变化不大。根据以上两个不同典型，县委在帮助各乡修订建设计划时，特别强调在发展粮食生产的前提下，全面发展多种经济，并帮助各乡研究了必须相适应的解决水、肥、工、煤、路五大问题。经过修订十年建设规划以后，干部和群众反映：方向明确，劲头高涨，增加信心，有了办法。
    修订生产计划，推动大丰收，解决具体问题，巩固合作社。工作组到乡后，从检查推动大丰收入手，针对各社具体情况和存在的问题，除着重纠正了在粮食增产上的盲目乐观和消极悲观两种情绪，并教育干部把大丰收的思想工作贯彻始终外，同时并帮助乡、社解决了大量的具体问题，改进了各方面的工作。帮助一百零六个社修订了增产计划，使之更加符合实际，从而鼓舞了群众的增产信心。帮助合作社解决了劳动、财务管理上的一系列问题，如改进劳动管理的三十五个社，改进牲口饲养管理的五十个社，整顿财务工作的三十五个社。第三，在遭灾地区，县委提出“小麦歉收秋田补，山货减收副业补”的口号，具体帮助各乡、社研究了生产救灾的办法。第四，认真帮助合作社改进积肥办法，解决肥料问题。如杏城工农社养猪不垒圈，牲口不垫圈，去年牛、羊、猪圊肥四项仅积肥两万二千多担，经过研究帮助，今后执行定时定量垫圈出圈，每年即可积肥十八万多担，第五，挖掘水源，引河水上山。过去几年全县水浇田只有一千余亩，这次实地帮助阳高、石城、王曲等八个乡挖掘水的潜力，共可增加水浇地六千至一万亩。第六，推动了防洪抗灾工作，巡视中发现有十五个村庄、二百零八户居住有受洪灾危险，及时组织了防洪保护和迁移工作。
    边学边整边改
    对于县委和全体干部是一次实际的教育，也是一次深刻的整风。在近四十天的活动时间中，不仅大大推动了各方面的工作，而且也深深教育了干部，丰富了领导。县委和下乡的全体同志，一致感到把办公室搬到农村去巡回办公，就是边学、边整、边改的统一实践。在这一方面最突出的收获是：（1）普遍深入了全县五十一个乡，二百三十个社，五百一十八个自然庄，使领导上比较全面地了解了各地区自然条件、生产、生活状况，和党内外的思想状况。这对制定计划，指导生产，提供了依据，可以避免和减少官僚主义、主观主义现象发生。
    密切了党群关系，群众说：“土改时的老干部又下来了”。此次，参加集体下乡巡回办公的干部到村以后，不但登门访问，和群众亲切交谈，而且都和群众一块劳动，据不完全统计，共参加劳动七百九十余个工作日，这不但进一步密切了干部和群众的关系，而且也增强了干部的劳动观念。群众反映说：“土改时的老干部又下来了”。“毛主席教养下的干部文武双全，白天劳动，黑夜工作”。广武群众说：“为了大丰收，县委和农民一块劳动，这真是毛主席教养下的好干部。我们也要当毛主席教养下的好农民，共同努力建设社会主义新农村。”同时也教育乡、社干部认识到参加生产领导生产的重要，而且也克服了部分青年轻视体力劳动的错误思想。
    统一领导，互相协作，克服了过去中心工作与系统工作矛盾的现象。过去中心工作与系统工作的矛盾是个老问题，党委抽调干部下乡搞中心工作，有些系统领导有意见，他们错误的认为“中心是党政，系统是自己”。此次在县委统一领导下，组成工作组，协调动作，全面配合，到农村之后，全面了解，统一研究，统一解决，最后大家都很满意。有的说：“过去是条条下达，家家插腿；这次集体下乡，既搞了系统，又服务了中心”。特别是乡、社干部十分满意，他们说：“过去是干部下乡，提出问题，得不到及时解决，这次集体下乡，提出的问题大部分可以得到解决”。从而也进一步密切了上下级之间的关系。
    有效地加强了党委的集体领导制度，坚持集体领导与个人分工负责的原则，充分发挥了集体领导的作用。克服了过去一部分县委委员下乡，一部分委员在机关坚持工作，使个人负责和集体领导结合不起来，对有关的重大问题，不能及时研究解决的现象。此次集中一片，定期研究讨论，四十天时间，电话召开常委会五次，全体县委会议两次，对于工作中的较大的问题都坚持了集体讨论，加以解决。同时还减少了机关文牍主义。据县委会和县人民委员会两个机关统计，在办公室搬到农村这四十天中，下发公文八十九件，比过去同时期减少了29％，乡、社干部十分满意。
    总之，把机关办公室搬到农村中实行巡回办公，其结果是大大丰富了领导，深深地教育了干部和群众，广泛地发现和解决了问题，密切联系了群众，推动了大丰收，巩固了合作社，因之，县委满意，干部高兴，群众欢迎。
