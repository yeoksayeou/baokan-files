(According to the Liaoning Daily) A three-level cadre conference held in Black Mountain County from September 5th to 12th featured a major debate on grain issues. The debate proved that the state's policy of unified grain purchase and sale is absolutely necessary, and the localism and one-sided mass viewpoint advocating less state purchase and more sales must be criticized. The fallacies that "the reason for not completing last year's grain procurement task was that the task was too heavy," "livestock were weak and died because of insufficient feed," and "grain is produced by the peasants, so distribution should be to the commune members first, then the state" were all refuted one by one.

At the Sidaizi group meeting, Sun Jiuxiang, the Communist Youth League branch secretary of Qitaizi Township, said: "The reason why the grain procurement task was not completed last year was that the 'three fixings' [of production, purchase and sales] had a high output and the grain procurement task was too heavy. It has nothing to do with cadres' localism or the masses' individualism." One hundred and twenty township and commune cadres from six townships refuted his fallacy with reason. Liu Wenjun, the township head of Qitaizi Township, said:
	"Our county did not implement the 'three fixings' last year, but has been implementing it for two years. We have completed the task every year. Last year was a bumper harvest but we did not complete the task. Can it be said that the 'three fixings' had a high output and the grain procurement task was too heavy? If we don't look for the cause in the cadres' localism and the masses' individualism, where else can we look?" Liu Chunyuan, the Communist Party branch secretary of the Shiqihu Township, analyzed in his speech that the fundamental reason why their township failed to complete the grain procurement task last year was none other than the localism of the cadres. He said: "The cadres in our township always mistakenly believed that the farmers in our township used to eat less grain. After cooperativization, we had a bumper harvest, and the township should keep more grain to allow the farmers to eat more, so that this year's work would be easier. Therefore, they sympathized with and supported the cooperatives, production teams, and commune members in concealing output, making false reports, falsely reporting disasters, and stealing openly and secretly. The entire township concealed an average of 200 catties of output per hectare from the state, totaling 480,000 catties of grain. However, the entire township was 100,400 catties short of completing the grain procurement task last year. Can it be said that this has nothing to do with the cadres' localism? " Wang Yulin, the former secretary of the Dahu Mountain District Committee, said: "Last year, except for the 93rd Cooperative in Sijianfang Township, all other townships in the Dahu Mountain District completed the grain procurement task. Why didn't the 93rd Cooperative complete the grain procurement task? It was because the cadres had localist ideas and accommodated the masses' individualist ideas. Their corn conversion rate was more than 20% lower than other places. If a family was allocated 1,000 catties of corn, they would get 200 catties more, and 1,000 households would get 200,000 catties more."

After the debate, many comrades examined and criticized their own localist ideas and one-sided mass viewpoints, such as reporting lower output and higher sales to the state.

At the Jiangtun group meeting, some people advocated that "farmers produce grain, and the distribution of grain should be to the commune members first, then the commune, and then the state." Wang Shengwu, the director of the Yuhua Cooperative in Lijia Township, retorted: "If the distribution of grain prioritizes the private over the public, it will lead to farmers wanting to keep as much as they want, and wanting to keep whatever they want. It's equivalent to not having unified purchase and sale, and the state will not be able to uniformly control grain. Workers, soldiers, and urban residents will also not be able to eat enough, and no one will support the disaster areas. Farmers in sorghum-producing areas will have to eat sorghum, and cotton-producing areas will not even think about eating grain. We here (because we don't grow wheat and rice) don't even think about eating rice and white flour. The problems of clothing and food for us farmers will arise." Bao Tian'en, the Communist Party branch secretary of Jiangtun Township, said: "If we farmers only care about immediate interests, keep the good grain for ourselves, and give the state the bad sorghum and weed seeds, the workers and soldiers will not have enough to eat. Who will produce industrial products for us? Who will defend our national defense? We can't live without industrial products for a day, and if there is no army, imperialism will come and we will suffer again." Wang Zhiyou, the branch secretary of Lantun Township, used the real events in his township as a lesson, saying: "Last year, because our township had localist ideas, we mistakenly implemented a private-before-public distribution order in the distribution of grain. Many phenomena of open theft, secret robbery, and private distribution of grain occurred. As a result, we failed to complete the grain procurement task in a year of bumper harvest. On the surface, it seems to be beneficial to the farmers, but in reality, it harms the farmers. Continuing like this will cause the farmers to regress and foster the farmers' individualism and capitalism. If it continues to develop, some farmers will not even be willing to give the state substandard grain. How can we guarantee socialist construction?" After the debate, more than 140 township and commune cadres from eight townships in the group meeting unanimously denounced the fallacy of "distributing grain should be private before public" and expressed that they would resolutely implement the distribution order of public before private this year. Chen Wanqing, the director of the Changzheng Cooperative in Lijia Township, who originally published this fallacy, admitted his mistake in the face of truth.

Is the amount of feed left for livestock according to the "three fixings" standard too little? Are livestock weak and dying because of insufficient feed? A debate was launched at the Badaohao group meeting.

At the debate, Wang Deben, the Communist Party branch secretary of Gaoliqiangzi in Weichengzi Township, said: "The 'three fixings' leave little feed for livestock. Livestock were weak and died last year because one large livestock was given 960 catties of grain and one small livestock was given 504 catties of grain." One hundred and thirty township and commune cadres from seven townships in the group criticized his mistaken opinion. Wang Yaozhong, the Communist Youth League branch secretary of Weichengzi Township, said: "In the past, when we were working individually, our two families partnered to raise two donkeys. One donkey would not eat more than five or six dou of grain a year. Now, according to the 'three fixings' standard, we leave more than one stone, which is twice as much as before." Wu Guofu, the director of the Xiaoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Kangtun Township, said: "The Liu Village Production Team and the Dou Village Production Team in our cooperative both left feed for livestock according to the 'three fixings' standard; the amount of feed was the same, but because the Liu Village Production Team did a good job in feeding management, the livestock were fat, while the livestock in Dou Village were thin because the feeding management was not good. Later, Dou Village improved the feeding management, and the livestock gained weight in less than two months. Can it be said that this is the reason for the lack of feed for livestock?"

After the debate, the facts refuted the fallacy that "the 'three fixings' standard leaves little feed for livestock, causing livestock to be weak and die." Everyone agreed that the amount of feed left for livestock according to the "three fixings" standard is enough for the livestock to eat. The weakness and death of livestock are mainly the result of careless feeding, improper use, and poor feeding.

    黑山县三级干部会上一场大争
    驳倒征购粮食过重的谬论
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：9月5日至12日在黑山县召开的三级干部会上，就粮食问题展开了大辩论，辩论的结果证明，国家的粮食统购统销政策绝对必要，主张国家少购多销的本位主义和片面群众观点必须批判。那些认为“去年征购粮任务没完成的原因是任务重”“牲口瘦弱死亡是因为料不足”“粮食是农民生产的，所以分配上应先社员后国家”等谬论被一一驳倒。
    在四台子小组会上，七台子乡团总支书记孙九祥说：“去年没有完成征购粮任务：是‘三定’的产量高，征购粮的任务重了，和干部有本位主义思想以及群众有个人主义思想没有关系。”六个乡一百二十名乡、社干部据理驳斥了他的谬论。七台子乡乡长刘文俊说：
  “我们县不是去年才实行‘三定’，已经实行二年了，年年都完成任务，去年是个大丰收反而没有完成任务，这能说是‘三定’产量高，征购粮任务重吗？不从干部的本位主义和群众的个人主义里去找，从哪里去找？”中共十七户乡总支书记刘春远在发言中分析他们乡去年没有完成征购粮任务的根本原因不是别的，就是因为干部本位主义思想的作怪。他说：“我们乡上的干部过去总是错误地认为我们乡过去农民吃粮少，合作化后获得了丰收，本乡粮食留得充裕一些，农民多吃一点，今年工作好作一些。因此，就同情和支持了合作社、生产队和社员隐瞒产量、弄虚作假、假报灾情和明偷暗抢等等错误作法。全乡平均每垧地向国家隐瞒二百斤产量，共隐瞒四十八万斤粮食。而去年全乡差十万零四千斤没有完成征购粮的任务。这能说和干部的本位主义思想没有关系吗？原大虎山区委书记王玉林说：“去年大虎山区除了四间房乡九三社没完成征购粮任务外，别的乡都完成了。为什么九三社没完成征购粮任务呢？就是因为干部有本位主义思想迁就了群众个人主义思想。他们苞米折合率比别的地方低二成多，如果一家按分一千斤苞米算，一户多分二百斤，一千户就多分二十万斤。”
    经过辩论提高认识以后很多同志检查和批判了自己向国家报产量宁低勿高，报销量宁高勿低等本位主义思想和片面群众观点。
    在姜屯小组会上，有人主张“农民是生产粮食的，分配粮食应该先社员，后社，然后国家。”历家乡玉华社社主任王胜武反驳说：“分配粮食如果先私后公，那就会形成农民愿意留多少就留多少，愿意留啥就留啥，等于不要统购统销，国家就没法统一掌握粮食，工人、军队、城市居民也吃不饱，灾区也没有人支援了。产高粱地区的农民就得全吃高粱，产棉花地区，也别想吃粮食了，我们这地方也不用想吃大米白面（因为不种小麦和水稻），我们农民穿衣吃饭都成了问题。”中共姜屯乡分支部书记鲍天恩说：我们农民要是光图眼前利益，把好粮食自己留下，把瞎高粱，秕稗子给国家，工人、军队吃不饱，谁给我们生产工业品？谁给我们保卫国防？没有工业品我们一天也不行，没有军队，帝国主义一来我们又遭殃了。兰屯乡总支书记王志有用他本乡的实事，引为教训说：“去年我们乡因为有本位主义思想，在分配粮食的时候错误地实行了先私后公的分配次序，出现许多明偷、暗抢和私自分粮的现像，结果是丰收年反而没有完成粮食征购任务。表面看好像对农民有些好处，实际上是害了农民。这样继续下去，会使农民倒退，滋长农民个人主义和资本主义。再发展下去，有部分农民连次粮食也不愿意给国家了，这样怎能保证社会主义建设呢！”经过辩论，小组会上八个乡一百四十多名乡社干部一致痛斥“分配粮食应先私后公”的谬论，都表示今年坚决执行先公后私的分配次序。原来发表这个谬论的历家乡长征社社主任陈万清在真理面前承认了错误。
    按“三定”标准给牲畜留料少不少？牲畜瘦弱死亡是因为饲料留量不够吗？八道壕小组会上展开了辩论。
    辩论会上，中共围城子乡高力墙子分支部书记王德本说：“按三定给牲畜留料，牲畜料少，去年牲畜瘦弱、死亡就是因为一个大牲畜给九百六十斤粮食，一个小牲畜给留五百零四斤粮食的缘故。”该组七个乡一百三十名乡、社干部批判了他的错误意见。围城子乡团总支书记王耀忠说：“过去单干时，我们两家搭犋养两头驴，一头驴一年不过喂五、六斗粮食，现在按‘三定’标准留一石多，比过去多喂一倍。”康屯乡晓光农业社社主任吴国富说：“我们社刘屯生产队和窦屯生产队都是按‘三定’标准给牲畜留的料；一样的留量，可是刘屯生产队因为饲养管理工作作的好，牲畜就胖，窦屯因为饲养管理工作不好，牲畜就瘦，后来窦屯改进了饲养管理工作，不到两个月牲畜也都上膘了，这能够说是牲畜料少的原因吗？”
    经过辩论，事实驳倒了“三定标准牲畜料少，使牲畜瘦弱、死亡”的谬论。大家一致认为：按“三定”标准给牲畜留料，牲畜够吃。牲畜瘦弱、死亡主要是饲养不精心、使役不当和饲养不善的结果。
