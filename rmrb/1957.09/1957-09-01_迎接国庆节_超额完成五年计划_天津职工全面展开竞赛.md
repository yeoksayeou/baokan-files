Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 31st. To exceed the Five-Year Plan and welcome National Day, a socialist competition has been fully launched among workers in Tianjin.

The Tianjin Municipal State-owned Industrial and Transportation System and the Local Industrial System have recently revised their production increase and conservation plans, raising the city's industrial system's original production increase and conservation plan from 225 million yuan to 350 million yuan.

Leading up to this competition upsurge, the Tianjin municipal leadership departments had done a lot of preparatory work. On the one hand, starting in July, they mobilized and organized 1,000 amateur lecturers from various industrial enterprises to conduct large-scale socialist education among the city's workers. On the other hand, when selecting Tianjin's second-quarter advanced producers and advanced collectives, various industrial enterprises carried out mass criticism and self-criticism. This further increased the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and many factory workers put forward the slogan of "counterattacking the bourgeois rightists with practical production actions."

This competition will be carried out simultaneously with the rectification campaign. To this end, some factories have already formed rectification leadership groups and competition leadership groups to ensure that neither the rectification campaign nor the competition is neglected.

In the first half of this year, Tianjin workers launched two successive competition upsurges, which transformed Tianjin's industrial system from a severe shortage of raw materials to a basic easing, ensuring the over-fulfillment of the production plan for the first half of the year, and increasing production and conserving 160 million yuan. Starting in July, leading cadres of various industrial bureaus, companies, and factories have generally gone deep into the grassroots, summarized and inspected the achievements, experiences, and lessons of the production increase and conservation movement in the first half of the year, and studied key production issues with workers in workshops and teams.

    迎接国庆节  超额完成五年计划
    天津职工全面展开竞赛
    据新华社天津31日电  为超额完成五年计划、迎接国庆节的社会主义竞赛，已经在天津市职工中全面展开。
    天津市国营工业交通系统和地方工业系统最近先后修订了增产节约计划，把全市工业系统原订的二亿二千五百万元的增产节约计划，提高到三亿五千万元。
    在掀起这次竞赛高潮的前夕，天津市的领导部门曾经做了许多准备工作。一方面，从7月开始，发动并组织各工业企业的一千名业余讲解员，向全市职工进行了大规模的社会主义教育；另方面，各工业企业在评选天津市第二季度先进生产者和先进集体的时候，贯彻进行了群众性的批评与自我批评。这使得广大职工的生产热情进一步高涨，许多工厂的职工提出了“以生产实际行动，反击资产阶级右派”的口号。
    这次竞赛将同整风同时进行。为此，有些工厂已经组成了整风领导小组和竞赛领导小组，以保证整风、竞赛两不误。
    今年上半年，天津市职工曾先后掀起两次竞赛高潮，使得天津市工业系统由原材料严重缺乏转变到基本缓和，保证了上半年度生产计划的超额完成，并增产节约了一亿六千万元。从7月开始，各工业局、各公司和各厂的领导干部们，就普遍地深入基层，总结和检查了上半年增产节约运动的成就和经验教训，并且同车间、小组的职工一起研究了生产关键问题。
