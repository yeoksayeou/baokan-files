Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 8th: Romanian newspapers published on the 7th a joint statement from the Romanian and Mongolian government delegations' talks.

The statement said that the two delegations exchanged views on international issues of concern to both parties during the talks, and also discussed the continued strengthening of friendly ties and fraternal cooperation between the two countries. The two governments stated that they will make every effort to promote the unity and cooperation of socialist countries and for international peace and security in the future.

The two governments believe that the cessation of testing and prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, and the reduction of armaments by major powers, are decisive conditions for maintaining world peace and security. The two governments believe that the Soviet Union's proposals on these issues are practical and feasible.

The two governments believe that the non-recognition by certain groups of the right of the Mongolian People's Republic to participate in the United Nations is inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations. The Romanian government once again declares its support for Mongolia's just demand to join the United Nations.

The statement said that the two governments will continue to strengthen cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields. In order to help each other in peaceful construction, the two sides agreed to begin discussions on the signing of a trade agreement. The statement concluded by saying that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia invited the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania and other leaders to visit Mongolia, and Chairman Stoica accepted the invitation.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 8th: The government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Tsedenbal, arrived in Budapest from Bucharest this morning.
