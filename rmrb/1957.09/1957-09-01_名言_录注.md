    "Famous Quotes" Recorded Notes
    Gu Yan
    Rereading Ding Ling's articles under the lamp, I have gained some new insights. I have extracted two "famous quotes" that were once used as slogans to call on literary and art workers, and added some annotations as recorded notes for publication. This does not count as poetry.
    One "Step into the New Era"
    "Step into the New Era,"
    ——Tightly dragging along Shafei's shadow,
    Changing in a thousand ways, yet never changing.
    "Step into the New Era,"
    ——Collectively suppressing the "self" to "insignificance,"
    Self-centeredness cannot expand.
    "Step into the New Era,"
    ——Those who are promoted are promoted, those who become rich become rich,
    "I am a poor peasant," "I want to turn over,"
    "I want land reform." "Step into the New Era,"
    ——"I am a person crawling out of the grave,"
    "I" want to avenge blood feuds, "I" want to demand redress for grievances.
    Two "Take Root Among the Masses"
    "Take Root Among the Masses,"
    ——Fragrant Hills, Western Hills, Summer Palace,
    Hangzhou, Kunming, Emei mist.
    "Take Root Among the Masses,"
    ——Going to the countryside for three days, using two days as a cover,
    Returning to Beijing to sit in command of the anti-Party headquarters.
    "Take Root Among the Masses,"
    ——Visiting backward elements, villains, old lechers,
    Luring a few traitors, anti-Party "individual households."
    "Take Root Among the Masses,"
    ——Once the anti-Party conspiracy is exposed,
    "Retreating" to the banks of the Sanggan River.
    Three
    Overall Comment:
    "Step into the New Era,"
    ——Pulling the train of history backwards;
    "Take Root Among the Masses,"
    ——Organizing an anti-Party clique for a major counterattack,
    "The secret lies here,"
    Believe it? Or not?

    “名言”录注
    孤烟
    灯下重读丁玲的文章，略有新得，摘录两句曾经作为口号号召文艺工作者的“名言”，稍加注释，作为录注发表，这不算诗。
    一“跨到新时代来”
    “跨到新时代来”，
    ——紧紧拖着莎菲的影子，
    千变万化总不改。
    “跨到新时代来”，
    ——集体把“我”压“渺小”，
    自我中心扩张不开。
    “跨到新时代来”，
    ——升官的升官，发财的发财，
    “我是贫雇农”，“要翻身”，
    “要土改”。“跨到新时代来”，
    ——“我是从坟墓里爬出来的人”，
    “我”要报血仇，“我”要索冤债。
    二“到群众中去落户”
    “到群众中去落户”，
    ——香山、西山、颐和园，
    杭州、昆明、峨嵋雾。
    “到群众中去落户”，
    ——下乡三天两天打掩护，
    回京坐镇反党指挥部。
    “到群众中去落户”，
    ——拜访落后分子、恶棍、老色鬼，
    拉拢个把叛徒、反党“单干户”。
    “到群众中去落户”，
    ——一旦反党阴谋败露后，
    桑乾河畔“隐居”去。
    三
    总评曰：
    “跨到新时代来”，
    ——拉着历史的列车往后开；
    “到群众中去落户”，
    ——组织反党集团大反扑，
    “奥秘就在这里”，
    信乎？不信乎？
