Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 22nd: The Sino-Indian Friendship Association has decided to open a Chinese language learning class in New Delhi starting early next year to meet the growing desire of people to learn Chinese.

    In the past few years, the Sino-Indian Friendship Association has held two Chinese language learning classes with many participants, one in Calcutta and the other in Bombay. The West Bengal branch of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association recently issued a notice inviting applications for the newly added Chinese language learning class.

    The Foreign Language School run by the Indian Ministry of Defense has been offering a Chinese language class in Delhi for Indian Foreign Ministry staff and other government employees for the past three years. Many staff members of All India Radio and a large number of teachers are also actively learning Chinese.

    Calcutta University and Tagore-founded International University also have Chinese courses.

    Recently, Speaker of the People's Assembly, Ayengar, in his opening speech at the Chinese Film Festival, called on the Indian people to learn the languages of Asian countries, especially the language of 600 million Chinese, in order to increase understanding and friendship.

    印度朋友嗜学中文
    新华社新德里22日电　印中友好协会已经决定从明年初起在新德里开设一个中文学习班，以便满足人们学习中文的日益强烈的愿望。
    过去几年中，印中友好协会已经举办了两个有很多人参加的中文学习班，一个在加尔各答，另外一个在孟买。印中友好协会西孟加拉分会最近发出一个通知，请大家申请参加新添设的中文学习班。
    印度国防部办的外国语学校过去三年来在德里为印度外交部工作人员和其他政府雇员开设了一个中文班。全印广播电台的许多工作人员和大批教师也在积极地学习中文。
    加尔各答大学和泰戈尔福办的国际大学也有中文课。
    最近，人民院议长阿延加尔在中国电影节开幕词中号召印度人民学习亚洲国家的语言，特别是六亿中国人的语言，以便增加了解和友谊。
