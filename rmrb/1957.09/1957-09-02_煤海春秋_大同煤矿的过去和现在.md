Coal Sea Spring and Autumn
——The Past and Present of the Datong Coal Mine

　　“Today's Datong Mine,
　　Is like being in heaven;
　　The electric lights are bright,
　　Machinery is busy everywhere;
　　Producing thousands of tons of coal,
　　Without much effort;
　　Building a new China,
　　Good coal is shipped everywhere.”

　　This is a folk rhyme composed by the miners of the Datong Coal Mine after liberation, and it is a vivid portrayal of today's mines. This coal sea, famous throughout the world for its reserves, once had a past full of disasters. As early as the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the rulers exiled large numbers of criminals here, forcing them to mine coal. During the Kuomintang and Japanese rule, they plundered unscrupulously, and the coal seams were severely damaged. At that time, the miners had to work 12-15 hours a day, carrying coal on their backs and crawling on all fours in dark, water-filled coal pits. In 1939 alone, a mine flooded and drowned more than fifty workers, and as for the collapse of the roof, killing workers was even more common. In the eight years of Japanese rule, more than 10,000 miners died. The workers said at the time, "Eating the food of the living, doing the work of the dead."

　　After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the staff and workers have rebuilt all six of the old mines into modern, new-type mines. The degree of mechanization in coal mining is as high as 90% or more. Underground, there is a guarantee of fresh air, and the temperature is warm as spring all year round. There are various safety protection devices. Coal production is more than ten times higher than the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Due to the abundance of coal deposits, new mines will soon be built here, increasing production two or three times more than it is now. (Attached pictures)

### 煤海春秋——大同煤矿的过去和现在

    煤海春秋
    ——大同煤矿的过去和现在
    “今日大同矿，  好比在天堂；
    电灯明又亮，  机械到处忙；
    产煤几千吨，  不费大力量；
    建设新中国，  好煤运四方。”
    这是解放后大同煤矿矿工们自编的一首歌谣，它是今日矿井的一幅逼真写照。这个以蕴藏量闻名于世界的煤海，曾有一个灾难重重的过去。远在明、清两朝，统治者就曾把大批犯人流放到这里，强迫采煤。国民党、日本统治时期，更是不择手段地掠夺，矿体遭到了严重的破坏。那时的矿工，每日要工作12—15小时，用脊背背煤，四肢爬行在阴暗积水的煤洞里。仅1939年一个矿井发水就淹死工人五十多个，至于顶板下塌，砸死工人的事，更是屡见不鲜。在日本统治的八年中，就有一万多矿工死亡。工人说当时“吃的是阳间饭，作的是阴间活。”
    解放后，职工们在党的领导下，已把全部旧有的六座矿井改建成为现代化的新型矿井。采煤机械化程度高达90％以上，井下保证有新鲜空气，四季温暖如春，有各种安全保护设备。煤产量比抗日战争以前最高年产量提高十倍以上。由于煤藏的丰富，不久将在这里建设新矿井，使产量再比现在增加二、三倍。（附图片）
