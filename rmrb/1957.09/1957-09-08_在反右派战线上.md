On the Anti-Rightist Front

Publicly Advocating for Street Protests: Zheng Zixiu is a Rightist Element Within the Party

Zheng Zixiu, the office director of the Shenyang Municipal Transportation Management Bureau, is a rightist element who infiltrated the Party.

As early as the end of last year, Zheng Zixiu openly clamored: to "go to the streets to make trouble." Zheng Zixiu also threatened to "hang the Communist Party members and activists on telephone poles," and then he would "walk up to them with a pipe in his mouth and ask: 'Hey, how is it?'" He also said: "I would only feel happy putting them on trees," "I am still your comrade now, but maybe tomorrow I will become your enemy."

In order to realize his conspiracy, Zheng Zixiu used the dissatisfaction of some loading and unloading workers of the Shenyang Regional Transportation Company, which is under the Transportation Bureau, with their wages to carry out instigation activities. At a meeting, Zheng Zixiu wantonly slandered, saying that the regional company "deducts workers' wages" and is a "new foreman." After the meeting, he went to the workers to spread this fallacy and incited the workers, saying: "If the problem is not resolved, we must petition."

Zheng Zixiu, this vicious rightist element who has infiltrated the Party for many years, has now been exposed. The staff of the Transportation Bureau are now fiercely pursuing him.

The Sinister Face Under the Engineer's Garb
Ding Shuyao Wildly Fabricates Anti-Communist Slanders

The staff of the Baotou Municipal Road Company have been holding meetings for days to expose the reactionary remarks of the rightist element Ding Shuyao.

The rightist element Ding Shuyao is an engineer of the Baotou Municipal Road Company and a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. In order to frantically attack the Party, deny the Party's leadership, and slander the Party's achievements, he wantonly slandered, saying: "The Communist Party's capital was obtained from the Long March and the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, they were intoxicated with the cheers of victory and could not see the shortcomings. Today they are consuming this capital, sitting idle and eating their fortune." He slandered Communist Party members, saying: "The whole country is the same, most Party members are bad, two-thirds of the Party members in Baotou are not good, and the good ones are individual cases." In order to incite others not to work in Baotou with peace of mind, he fabricated rumors, saying: "A cemetery will be built under Daqingshan, and you will be buried there in the future!"

    在反右派战线上
    公然叫嚣上街闹事郑子修是个党内右派分子
    沈阳市交通运输管理局办公室主任郑子修，是一个混入党内的右派分子。
    去年年底，郑子修便公然叫嚣：要“到大街上去闹事”。郑子修还扬言要把共产党员和积极分子“吊在电线杆子上”，并且那时他要“叼着烟斗走到面前问：‘喂，怎么样？’”。他还说：“把他们吊在树上，我才痛快”，“我现在还是你们的同志，说不定明天就成了你们的敌人”。
    为了实现他的阴谋，郑子修便利用交通局所属沈阳地区运输公司部分装卸工人对工资不满进行煽动活动。郑子修在一次会上大肆诬蔑，说地区公司“克扣工人工资”，是“新把头”。会后，他还到工人中去散布这种谬论，并且煽动工人说：“不解决问题就得请愿”。
    郑子修这个混进党内多年的凶恶的右派分子现在已原形毕露。交通局工作人员现正猛烈追击中。

    包头市道路公司职工连日开会，揭发了右派分子丁树尧的反动言行。
    右派分子丁树尧是包头市道路公司的工程师，国民党革命委员会的成员。为了疯狂地向党进攻，否认党的领导，诋毁党的成绩，他大肆诬蔑地说：“共产党的资本是从长征和抗日战争时期得到的，胜利后，沉醉在胜利的欢呼中，看不到缺点，今天是消耗这些资本，坐吃山空。”他诬蔑共产党员说：“全国都一样，大部分党员都是坏的，包头有三分之二的党员不好，好的是个别的。”为了煽动别人不安心在包头工作，他就造谣说：“大青山下建立一个公墓，将来在那里会尸吧！”
