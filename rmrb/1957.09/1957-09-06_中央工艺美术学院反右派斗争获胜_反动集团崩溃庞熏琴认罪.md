The anti-Rightist struggle at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts is continuing to deepen, and the Pang Xunqin anti-Party clique has fallen apart.

A large amount of revealed material shows that since November of last year, Pang Xunqin has been colluding with Rightist elements within the Party, such as Liu Shouqiang and He Yanming, as well as Rightist elements of the China Democratic League, such as Zheng Ke, Zhu Danian, and Chai Fei, to carry out conspiratorial anti-Party activities. During this year's rectification campaign, they misjudged the situation and launched a frenzied attack on the Party, attempting to "sweep out the door" the Party's Deputy Deans and responsible cadres in the Party, the Communist Youth League, and personnel departments, creating a small "Hungarian incident" within the Academy.

As early as 1949, Pang Xunqin colluded with Jiang Feng, the anti-Party ringleader in the art world, who deliberately promoted him to a leadership position in arts and crafts. Their relationship was, as Pang Xunqin confessed: "On my part, I wanted to gain actual leadership of this school (i.e., the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts), I used him, and he supported me; on his part, he wanted to become the leader of the art world nationwide, he used me, and I supported him."

After Pang's anti-Party poisonous weed, "Following the Party, Truth Will Always See the Sun," was published, Fu Lei immediately wrote a letter to Pang, praising him: "Good, my friend, very good... Judging from the article in the newspaper, there is a lot more that has not been written, enough to write a book... How often have you and I lived to see so many unreasonable things exposed all over the country?... The more I see exposed, the happier and more comforted I am." Song Zhiying, a Rightist element of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the Central Administration of Handicraft Industry, also wrote a letter to Pang "congratulating" him after seeing Pang's poisonous weed.

The goal of Pang Xunqin's anti-Party activities was to seize leadership of the national arts and crafts industry. Actively helping Pang Xunqin carry out this task was the "military advisor" of the small clique, the Party member Rightist element He Yanming.

He Yanming was originally engaged in Nanjing's Yunjin (brocade) research work. There were four others with him, who called each other brothers, with He Yanming as their leader. After He was transferred to Beijing, he was highly valued by Pang Xunqin. Under his identity as a Party member, He Yanming personally directed the "struggle" of those people in Nanjing, instructing them in frequent letters to "insist on leadership by the Ministry of Culture" and instructing them on the "tactics" of the "struggle." After the rectification campaign began, He Yanming believed that "one cannot say that this timing and climate have not added a lot of convenience to the struggle for the cause," encouraging them to let go and light the fire.

Pang Xunqin also personally wrote letters to ignite fires in various places.

After two months of struggle against Pang Xunqin's anti-Party activities, after comrades throughout the Academy presented facts and reasoned things out, exposing a large number of ironclad materials, he was unable to deny it and finally had to bow his head and confess that he had committed the crimes of anti-Party and anti-socialism, and expressed his intention to thoroughly transform his own thinking in the future. However, the core members of the anti-Party clique, Zheng Ke and Zhu Danian, are still not honest in their attitude, giving light weight to important issues in their confessions. The masses are extremely angry and determined to fight them to the end.

### 中央工艺美术学院反右派斗争获胜  反动集团崩溃庞熏琴认罪

    中央工艺美术学院反右派斗争获胜
    反动集团崩溃庞熏琴认罪
    本报讯　中央工艺美术学院的反右派斗争正继续深入，庞熏琴反共小集团已经土崩瓦解。
    揭露的大量材料说明，庞熏琴自去年11月即拉拢党内右派分子刘守强、何燕明及民盟盟员右派分子郑可、祝大年、柴扉等进行阴谋反共活动。在今年整风期间，他们错误地估计了形势，疯狂的向党进攻，企图把党员正副院长及党、团、人事等负责干部“扫地出门”，在学院内造成小“匈牙利事件”。
    早在1949年庞熏琴即和美术界反党头目江丰勾搭起来，江丰蓄意把他提拔到工艺美术的领导岗位上。他们的关系正如庞熏琴交代中所说：“在我这方面，我要取得这个学校（即中央工艺美术学院）的实际领导权，我利用了他，他支持了我；在他那方面，他要成为全国的美术界的领导者，他利用我，我拥护他。”
    当庞的那篇反党的毒草“跟着党走、真理总会见太阳”发表之后，傅雷马上写信向庞赞扬说： “好，朋友，好得很……从报上的文章看，其他没有写出的事还有一大堆，可以写成一部书……你我活到如今又几曾看到全国各地揭出这么多不合理的事呢？……我看见暴露的愈多，愈高兴、愈安慰”。中央手工业管理局的农工民主党员右派分子宋之英在看到庞的那篇毒草后，也写信给庞“致贺”。
    庞熏琴反党活动的目标是要夺取全国工艺美术的领导权。积极帮着庞熏琴开展这项工作的就是小集团的“军师”、党内右派分子何燕明。
    何燕明原是在南京搞云锦研究工作的。和他在一起的还有四个人，彼此称兄道弟，何燕明就是他们的头目。何调来北京后，即为庞熏琴所重用。何燕明以党员身份亲自指挥着南京那些人的“斗争”，在频繁的书信中指示他们“一定要坚持由文化部领导”，并指示他们“斗争”的“策略”。整风开始以后，何燕明认为“不能不说这时机、气候于事业的斗争增添了不少便利”，鼓励他们放手点火。
    庞熏琴还亲自写信向各地点火。
    庞熏琴的反共活动，经过两个月的斗争后，在全院同志摆事实、讲道理揭发了大量铁证如山的材料之后，已无法狡赖，终于不得不低头伏罪，承认已犯了反共反社会主义的罪恶，并表示今后要彻底改造自己的思想。但反共小集团的骨干分子郑可和祝大年，态度还不老实，交代问题避重就轻，群众极为愤怒，并决心和他们斗争到底。
