Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 27th: The famous Czechoslovak athlete and world long-distance running champion, Chatopek, exposed the lies fabricated by "Radio Free Europe" on the 26th, once again embarrassing this radio station established by the American spy agency. A few days ago, "Radio Free Europe" broadcast that Chatopek, when participating in a competition in West Germany not long ago, had told a West German reporter who interviewed him that, in order for the Czechoslovak people to have a better understanding of the government, the Czechoslovak people had to read Marx's works every morning. However, he himself does not read them. He reads the Bible. He draws strength from the Bible. It is said that he also said that he had been taught to pray by his mother since he was a child, and that no one in the world could stop him from praying.

When Chatopek heard the above story fabricated by "Radio Free Europe," he couldn't help but burst out laughing. He told a reporter from "People's Defense News" that he had never met this West German reporter. He had also never learned how to pray.

    查托皮克揭穿了谎言
    “自由欧洲”电台再次出丑
    据新华社布拉格27日电　捷克斯洛伐克著名运动员、世界长跑健将查托皮克26日揭穿了
  “自由欧洲”广播电台捏造的有关他的谎言，使这个美国特务机关建立的广播电台又一次出丑。几天前，“自由欧洲”广播电台广播说，查托皮克不久前在西德参加比赛时，曾对某一个访问他的西德记者说，为了使捷克斯洛伐克人对政府有更好的认识，捷克斯洛伐克人每天早晨不得不读马克思的著作。但是，他本人不读。他读的是圣经。他从圣经中取得了力量。据说，他还说他从小就由他的母亲教会了祷告，世界上也没有一个人能够使他停止祷告。
    当查托皮克听到“自由欧洲”电台捏造的上述故事后，不禁捧腹大笑不止。他对“人民防线报”记者说，他从来没有见过这一个西德记者。他也从没有学过如何做祷告。
