Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 1st: More than 110,000 employees of Shanghai's joint state-private commercial, grain, and foreign trade enterprises, who are shareholders after asset valuation, have been enjoying the benefits of the collective labor insurance contract since today.

After the high tide of socialist transformation last year, the city's joint state-private commercial, grain, and foreign trade units implemented interim measures for employee medical care and hardship subsidies. Now, in addition to continuing to enjoy the original medical care and hardship subsidies, employees of these joint venture units are further enjoying the benefits of the collective labor insurance contract. The collective labor insurance contract contains detailed provisions regarding employee sick leave, maternity leave, wages for work-related injuries, and bereavement and assistance fees for work-related disabilities and deaths due to illness. For example, female employees are given 56 days of prenatal and postnatal leave, and their wages are paid as usual. If an employee is off work due to illness, they will be paid 60% of their wages if their length of service is less than two years, and 90% of their wages if their length of service is more than eight years, within six months.

The collective labor insurance contract also stipulates the expenditure of funds for various benefits.

    上海十一万合营企业职工享受劳保
    据新华社上海1日电  上海十一万多名公私合营商业、粮食、外贸企业清财定股户的职工，从今天起享受劳动保险集体合同待遇。
    去年社会主义改造高潮以后，全市公私合营商业、粮食和外贸单位，就实行了职工疾病医疗和生活困难补助暂行办法。现在，这些合营单位职工除继续享受原来的疾病医疗和生活困难补助以外，还进一步享受劳动保险集体合同待遇。劳动保险集体合同对职工病假、产假、因工负伤的工资，以及因工残废、疾病死亡等抚恤补助费都作了详尽规定。例如，对女职工生育，给予产前产后五十六天假日，并且工资照发。职工因病停工，在六个月以内，工龄不满二年的，按本人工资额60％付给，工龄满八年的，按本人工资额90％付给。
    劳动保险集体合同对各项待遇的经费开支也作了规定。
