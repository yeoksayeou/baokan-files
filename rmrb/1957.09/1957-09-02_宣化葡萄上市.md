    Xuanhua grapes, famous throughout the country, have met the consumers of Xuanhua town. On the afternoon of the launch day alone, more than 800 jin were sold throughout Xuanhua town.

    This year, the agricultural cooperatives in Xuanhua town have improved their operation and management and increased the production enthusiasm of their members. As a result, the grape harvest this year is very good. It is estimated that the town can produce one million jin. At present, the members of the agricultural cooperatives are busy harvesting grapes, and the staff of the vegetable company's non-staple food station are busy purchasing, packaging, and shipping them to major cities. Soon, the nationally famous "White Grape", "Mare's Nipple", "Tiger's Eye", "Rose Fragrant" and other Xuanhua grapes will be available in large quantities in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin.

    宣化葡萄上市
    全国有名的宣化葡萄与宣化镇的消费者见面了，仅在上市当天下午，全宣化镇就售出了八百多斤。
    今年宣化镇的各个农业社，因为改进了经营管理，提高了社员们的生产积极性，因此，今年葡萄的收成很好，估计全镇可产一百万斤。目前，农业社的社员们正在忙着收摘葡萄，蔬菜公司副食品站的职工们正在忙着收购，包装，发运各大城市。不久，著名全国的“白葡萄”、“马奶子”、“老虎眼”、“玫瑰香”等宣化葡萄就可以在北京、上海、天津等各大城市大量上市。
