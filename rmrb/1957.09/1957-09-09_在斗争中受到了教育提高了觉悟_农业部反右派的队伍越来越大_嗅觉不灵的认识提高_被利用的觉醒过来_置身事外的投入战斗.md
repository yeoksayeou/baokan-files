Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: The ranks of those participating in the anti-bourgeois Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Agriculture are growing ever larger. Some people who previously had an unclear understanding of the anti-Rightist struggle have been educated in the struggle, raised their consciousness, and are now actively engaging in face-to-face struggle with the Rightists.

In the past, some people in the Ministry of Agriculture, due to their dull political senses, were unable to distinguish right from wrong regarding the Rightists' words. Some mistakenly believed that the anti-Rightist struggle had nothing to do with them and stood aside. Still others were old colleagues and acquaintances of the Rightists, and could not bring themselves to expose and criticize them. These people have all been educated in the struggle. On the one hand, the Rectification Leadership Group organized them to study documents and participate in discussions in greater depth, helping them to raise their understanding. On the other hand, the ugly faces and insidious intentions of the exposed Rightists aroused their resentment. Therefore, they have all come forward one after another to expose and criticize the Rightists.

Zeng Xianpu was one such Rightist who suffered a heavy blow. He was a henchman of Zhang Bojun planted in the Ministry of Agriculture. He carried out the instructions of Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu, actively convened and presided over the so-called symposium of senior intellectuals in the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy fields, and incited Rightists and some disgruntled individuals to launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party. He also directed members of the Rightist clique, such as Shen Zengkan, Liu Guofang, and Guo Shufan, behind the scenes to stir up trouble in the Ministry of Agriculture, clamoring to "discredit more than 90% of the Communist Party members, and let Chairman Mao see." They妄图[wàngtú] (妄图 means vainly attempting) attempted to usurp the leadership of the Communist Party and take the stage to "run the house." These reactionary activities and remarks, after being exposed at several debate conferences jointly held by the Economic Crops Bureau, the Seed Management Bureau, and the Grain Production Bureau, were still stubbornly denied by Zeng Xianpu. His cunning attitude angered those who had gradually raised their awareness and were familiar with his background. Shao Yongzhi, an old colleague of Zeng Xianpu in the old society, indignantly exposed Zeng Xianpu's ugly history at the debate conference, pointing out that he had been an anti-communist politician in the past and that his reactionary stance had never changed. Shao Yongzhi's exposure further made people recognize Zeng Xianpu's true colors. Senior agricultural technicians Hu Jingliang and Yao Zushun, who had been drawn into the symposium of senior intellectuals in the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy fields by Zeng Xianpu due to their lack of understanding, also stood up to expose and refute Zeng Xianpu's reactionary words and deeds.

In addition, some people, due to their radical thinking or being misled by Rightists, were influenced or even used by Rightists during the blooming and contending period, and made some erroneous remarks. Therefore, in the early stages of the anti-Rightist struggle, they were not active enough and even had many concerns. In response to this situation, the Rectification Leadership Group of this ministry and its subordinate units, as well as the vast majority of staff, on the one hand, criticized their erroneous remarks and thoughts from the desire for unity; on the other hand, they helped them to draw a clear line between themselves and the Rightists, and educated them to actively struggle against the Rightists. In this way, this group of people also joined the struggle one after another. Because they were more familiar with the Rightists' activities during the blooming and contending period, their exposures left the Rightists speechless. The Rightist clique composed of several members of the China Democratic League in the Ministry of Agriculture—Chu Jishan, Yang Maowu, and Zhao Shiru—was broken by Wang Jiacheng, who had been wooed and used by them. The members of this clique were extremely hostile to the Communist Party, and they believed that the rectification movement was a great opportunity for them to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. According to Chu Jishan's instructions, Yang Maowu and Zhao Shiru actively sought out people who were not members of the League but had been criticized and investigated in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements and who could be used, and incited them to attack the Communist Party in the League group meetings. Wang Jiacheng was leaning towards the Communist Party, but his individual heroism was relatively serious, so they pulled Wang Jiacheng over as a "cannon." At that time, Wang Jiacheng, under their instructions, wrote a big-character poster attacking the Communist Party and the Ministry of Agriculture entitled "Is There a Need for the Ministry of Agriculture to Exist?" The members of this clique also traveled around, offering advice and drafting or "ghostwriting" many big-character posters slandering and attacking the Communist Party. They advocated the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee" and demanded the removal of the Communist Party Committee Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture from their positions on the Rectification Leadership Group. After the anti-Rightist struggle began, Wang Jiacheng realized that he had made a mistake and asked to make a self-criticism. The leadership, on the one hand, criticized his erroneous thinking, and on the other hand, educated him to fight against the Rightists. At this time, Yang Maowu and Zhao Shiru also approached Wang Jiacheng, asking him to remain calm and not make a self-criticism. This further made Wang Jiacheng recognize their insidious intentions. At the debate conference, Wang Jiacheng angrily exposed them, dealing a fatal blow to this Rightist clique. Since then, those who had been influenced by this clique have also come forward to further expose the crimes of this Rightist clique.

Because those who were not active enough in the anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Agriculture have now come forward, the anti-Rightist struggle has achieved initial victory. Some Rightist cliques have disintegrated, and some Rightists have bowed their heads in confession.

    在斗争中受到了教育提高了觉悟
    农业部反右派的队伍越来越大
    嗅觉不灵的认识提高　被利用的觉醒过来　置身事外的投入战斗
    新华社8日讯　农业部参加反资产阶级右派斗争的队伍越来越大。一部分前些时候对反右派斗争认识不清的人，在斗争中受到教育，提高了觉悟，现在也积极地同右派分子进行面对面的斗争。
    农业部前些时候有些人由于政治嗅觉不灵，对右派分子的言论不能明辨是非，有些人错误地认为反右派斗争跟自己无关而置身事外，还有些人同右派分子是老同事、老相识，打不开情面，不好意思揭露和批驳他们。这些人在斗争中都受到了教育。一方面，由于整风领导小组组织他们比较深入地学习文件和座谈讨论，帮助他们提高了认识；另一方面，被揭露出来的右派分子的丑恶面貌和阴险企图，也引起了他们的愤恨，因此他们都先后起来揭露和批判右派分子。
    曾宪朴就是受到这样痛击的一个右派分子。他是章伯钧伸进农业部的爪牙。他执行了章伯钧和李伯球的指示，积极召集和主持所谓农林水利界高级知识分子座谈会，发动右派分子和一些心怀不满的人向共产党疯狂进攻。他并且在幕后指挥右派小集团的成员沈曾侃、刘国芳和郭树藩等在农业部煽风放火，叫嚣“要把90％以上的共产党员搞臭，叫毛主席看看。”妄图篡夺共产党的领导权，由他们上台“当家”。这些反动活动和言论，在经济作物局、种子管理局和粮食生产局联合举行的几次辩论大会上被揭露出来以后，曾宪朴仍然狡辩抵赖，他的这种狡猾态度，激怒了觉悟逐步提高又熟悉他的底细的人。曾宪朴在旧社会的老同事邵咏之，在辩论会上愤慨地揭露了曾宪朴的丑恶历史，指出他过去就是个反共政客，他的反动立场一直未变。邵咏之的揭露，更使人们认清了曾宪朴的本来面目。由于不明是非受曾宪朴拉拢参加过农林水利界座谈会的高级农业技术人员胡竟良、姚祖舜等，也起来揭露和驳斥了曾宪朴的反动言行。
    另外有一些人，由于思想偏激或者为右派分子所迷惑，在鸣放中受右派分子影响甚至被利用，放了一些错误言论。因此，他们在反右派斗争初期，不够积极，甚至顾虑重重。针对这种情况，这个部和所属单位的整风领导小组以及广大工作人员，一方面从团结的愿望出发，批判了他们的错误言论和思想；另方面帮助他们跟右派分子划清界限，教育他们积极地同右派分子斗争，这样，这部分人也先后投入斗争。由于他们比较熟悉右派分子在鸣放中的活动，他们的揭露，一下子就把右派分子攻得无话可说。民盟在农业部的几个成员——褚继善、杨茂武、赵世儒等人组成的右派小集团，就是由被他们拉拢利用过的王家澄起来揭露而攻破的。这个小集团的成员极端仇视共产党，他们认为整风是他们推翻共产党领导的大好时机。杨茂武、赵世儒根据褚继善的指示，在鸣放中积极网罗不是盟员但在三反、肃反中曾经受过批判、审查和可资利用的人，参加民盟小组会，煽动他们向共产党进攻。王家澄是靠拢共产党的，但是他的个人英雄主义比较严重，他们便把王家澄拉过去作“炮筒”。当时，王家澄根据他们的授意，写了攻击共产党、攻击农业部的题为“农业部是否需要存在”的大字报。这个小集团的成员还各处奔走，为别人出谋献策，起草或“代笔”写了不少诬蔑共产党、攻击共产党的大字报。他们主张成立“平反委员会”，要求撤销中共农业部委员会书记、副书记的整风领导小组成员的职务。反右派斗争开始以后，王家澄认识到自己犯了错误，要求检讨；领导上一方面批判了他的错误思想，一方面教育他要同右派分子作斗争。这时，杨茂武、赵世儒还找王家澄，让他沉住气，不要检讨。这样，更使王家澄认清了他们的阴险企图。在辩论大会上，王家澄愤怒地揭露了他们，给这个右派小集团致命一击。此后，受过这个小集团影响的人，也起来进一步揭露了这个右派小集团的罪恶。
    农业部由于前些时候对反右派斗争不够积极的人已经起来，反右派斗争获得了初步胜利，有的右派小集团已经土崩瓦解，有些右派分子已经低头认罪。
