Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 3rd: Shanghai's twenty-five paper mills produced more than 5,700 tons of paper than planned in the first eight months of this year, completing this year's plan to increase production by 5,100 tons ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of this year, these factories can increase production by 8,000 tons compared to the state plan.

Shanghai's paper industry, which accounts for about one-sixth of the country's total output, has a history of sixty-six years. Since liberation, this industry has not added any new equipment, but this year's paper production is more than five times higher than in 1949. The variety of paper has also increased by forty or fifty types in recent years, of which more than thirty types are industrial paper. Cable insulation paper, telephone line insulation paper, impregnated insulation paper, cotton paper, semiconductor paper, etc., which were previously reliant on imports, have all begun to be produced domestically in recent years, and the quality meets the requirements. Typewriting paper, a high-grade paper, not only does not need to be imported now, but has also begun to be exported.

The early completion of Shanghai's paper industry's production increase plan this year was achieved by overcoming extremely difficult pulp supply conditions. This year, Shanghai's pulp production has increased nearly sixfold compared to eight years ago, and the rate of increase is faster than that of paper.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, Shanghai's paper industry plans to strengthen cooperation with neighboring provinces and regions on the one hand, use the abundant rice straw and other grasses in the south to develop grass pulp production; on the other hand, it will further develop the capacity of existing pulp-making equipment and add some necessary equipment to meet the growing demand for paper in society.

    八个月多出五千多吨纸
    上海造纸工业提前完成今年增产计划
    据新华社上海3日电　上海二十五家造纸厂在今年前八个月比计划多生产了五千七百多吨纸，提前完成了今年全年增产五千一百吨纸的计划，预计到今年年底，这些厂可以比国家计划增产八千吨纸。
    产量约占全国六分之一的上海造纸工业，已经有六十六年的历史。解放后，这个行业并没有增添新的设备，今年纸的产量却比1949年提高五倍多。纸的品种这几年来也增加了四、五十种，其中有三十多种是工业用纸。过去一直依靠进口的电缆绝缘纸、电话线绝缘纸、浸渍绝缘纸、棉料纸、半导体纸等，近年来都已开始自制，质量也都符合要求。高级纸张中的打字纸，现在不但不需要进口，而且已经开始出口。
    上海造纸业今年增产计划的提前完成，是在克服纸浆供应极端困难的情况下实现的。今年上海纸浆产量比八年前增长将近六倍，增长的速度比纸张快。
    在第二个五年计划期间，上海造纸工业准备一方面加强和邻近省区的协作，利用南方盛产的稻草等草类，发展草浆的生产；另一方面将进一步发挥现有制浆设备的能力和增添一些必要的设备，以适应社会上纸张消费日益增长的需要。
