According to Shanghai Xinmin Evening News and Liberation Daily reports: The anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles is developing victoriously. On the afternoon of the 21st, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association held an enlarged joint meeting of executive committee members to conduct a large-scale reasoning struggle against Gao Fang, deputy general manager of the Tongyi Yarn Factory, using the method of presenting facts and reasoning to thoroughly refute the fallacies of this Rightist element who had thirty years of anti-people history and had served as the director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Bank. This conference was the largest meeting since the anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, with nearly a thousand people attending. Speakers were extremely enthusiastic. Their rebuttals were fully convincing and were a vivid example of a reasoning struggle against the Rightists.

Only by Taking the Socialist Road Can the Economy Develop Rapidly

Rightist Gao Fang has consistently attacked socialism and promoted capitalism. He has a series of reactionary theories, one of which is fundamentally opposing our taking the socialist road. He once said: "Before liberation, China's economy was a semi-colonial, deformed economic system, not a true capitalist economic system. The socialist economic system can only develop rapidly on the basis of a highly developed capitalist economic system. China does not have this condition today, so it must make up for the lesson." The so-called "make up for the lesson" in the mouth of Rightist Gao Fang is to clamor for us to return to the old road of capitalism and not take the socialist road.

Gao Fang's reactionary theory was shattered at the meeting on the 21st by Pang Jianxun, deputy director of the business office of the Cotton Textile Company, with the following facts. Pang Jianxun said: In the current socialist camp, besides Democratic Germany and Czechoslovakia, which country had a highly developed capitalist economic foundation before the revolution? In 1913, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value was only slightly more than 40% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. After the First World War and three years of domestic revolutionary war, when the New Economic Policy was implemented in 1920, industry was on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the industrious and brave Soviet working people finally established the world's first powerful socialist country empty-handed. To this day, the Soviet Union's economic development is higher than that of any capitalist country other than the United States. In most other socialist countries, the industrial foundation was also very weak before the revolution, but now there has been tremendous development. What is the situation in China? Taking steel production as an example, in 1949, our annual steel production was 158,000 tons. Eight years later, today, it has rapidly increased to 5.35 million tons, an increase of 34 times. The time it took for production to increase from one million tons to four million tons was four and a half years, while it took eleven years in Japan, seventeen years in the United States, twenty-two years in Britain, and forty-eight years in France.

Pang Jianxun exposed the conspiracy of the Rightist Gao Fang, saying: The facts are very clear. Only under the socialist system can the national economy achieve such unprecedented speed of development. The reason why Gao Fang reverses black and white is to try to pull us back on the socialist road, attempting to shake our foundation and achieve his sinister purpose of restoring capitalism in China.

Is the Production Motivation of Socialism Inferior to Capitalism?

Gao Fang slandered: "The production motivation of the socialist system relies on propaganda and movements, which is not as natural as the production motivation of capitalism that utilizes selfish psychology."

Pang Jianxun severely criticized Gao Fang's absurd argument. He said: Taking the cotton textile industry that Gao Fang is engaged in as an example, the total output of cotton yarn in Shanghai's joint state-private cotton mills was 348,000 pieces when they were privately owned (1949), while after the implementation of joint state-private ownership (1956), when the enterprises had a socialist nature, the total output of cotton yarn reached 867,000 pieces, an increase of one and a half times; labor productivity, in 1949, the average unit output of 20-count yarn per thousand spindles was 16.56 kilograms, and in 1956 it reached 25.31 kilograms, an increase of 53%. He asked Gao Fang: These are facts, right? Is the production motivation of socialism greater, or is the production motivation of capitalism that "utilizes selfish psychology" greater? Pang Jianxun said: Because the purpose of socialist production is to continuously increase and improve the material and cultural life of all the people, and the interests of individuals and society are completely consistent, all the people can selflessly work and exert infinite wisdom, which is the infinite driving force of socialist production. Can you say that this is false or reluctant?

Gao Fang slandered our fundamental method of developing the socialist economy and accumulating socialist construction funds—increasing production and practicing economy—as "the economy of a country old woman." Pan Xiangde used the achievements of increasing production and practicing economy in Shenxin No. 9 Factory to refute Gao Fang's fallacy.

Shenxin No. 9 Factory's target for increasing production and practicing economy this year is 1.66 million yuan. Due to the workers' enthusiasm for production, in the first half of the year alone, they increased production and practiced economy by 1.057 million yuan, completing 63.4% of the annual plan, thus greatly reducing production costs and accumulating a large amount of funds for the country. Pan Xiangde called Gao Fang's name and asked him: Tell me, is this "the economy of a country old woman"? Increasing production and practicing economy to build socialism is precisely for the long-term interests of all the people and the motherland. On what basis do you say that this is "saving my money to waste yours, saving today's money to waste tomorrow's, saving the unit's money to waste the public's"?

Seeing the Superiority of Socialism from the Perspective of Savings

Rightist Gao Fang slandered: "The people have lost the object and purpose of saving." Sun Ruihuang, manager of a joint state-private bank who has been engaged in banking for 28 years, pointed out: This sentence can only be applied to the period when Gao Fang was the director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Bank, while today's facts are completely the opposite. He reviewed the history before liberation, saying: From June 1937 to May 1949, the amount of puppet legal tender issued increased by 176.8 billion times. This is an astronomical figure, and the people's livelihood and the national economy suffered incalculable losses. In the ten years from 1937, the change in the value of the puppet legal tender was: in 1937, 100 yuan of puppet legal tender could buy two large cattle, in 1938 it could still buy one large cattle and one small cattle, in 1939 it could only buy one large cattle, in 1940 it could only buy one small cattle, in 1941 it was reduced to only being able to buy one pig, in 1942 it dropped to the price of a ham, and after 1943 the value of the currency fell even more miserably, from being able to buy a chicken, a small bag of rice, a fish, or an egg, and in 1947 it dropped to the point where 100 yuan of puppet legal tender could only buy one-fifth of a fried dough stick. In that era, the people's blood was squeezed dry. Where were the savings of the people? After liberation, there was a completely new atmosphere. The people's savings cause is booming, which is due to the two basic conditions of price stability and surplus of food and clothing.

The growth of people's savings in the past eight years is: 10.07 million in 1949, 110 million in 1950, 470 million in 1951, 840 million in 1952, 1.2 billion in 1953, 1.4 billion in 1954, 1.69 billion in 1955, 2.23 billion in 1956, and 2.48 billion by the end of June this year, and it has now exceeded 2.5 billion. There are a total of 23.68 million bank depositors, close to the total number of employees in the country, and almost everyone has savings. The average deposit period until 1956 was 128 days, and fixed deposits accounted for 70% of the deposit types. Sun Ruihuang also calculated such an account for Rightist Gao Fang: From 1906, when China began to have banks handle savings business, to 1936, in the 30 years, the highest amount of people's deposits in national public and private banks was more than 580 million puppet legal tender, equivalent to 5.8 million taels of gold. In the eight years after liberation, the highest amount of people's deposits was calculated at 2.48 billion yuan, equivalent to 22.5 million taels of gold. In comparison, in a quarter of the time, deposits increased fourfold. This is an ironclad fact, fully demonstrating the gradual improvement of people's lives and the superiority of the socialist system, and also giving the Rightists' malicious slander a resounding slap in the face.

Our Democracy and Freedom is the Democracy and Freedom of the People

In political life, Rightist Gao Fang opposed the people's democratic dictatorship and promoted the bourgeoisie's "absolute democracy" and "absolute freedom." He said: "Western democracy is true democracy." He slandered our elections as being "like cotton sampling," undemocratic. Regarding this reactionary fallacy, Dong Yinchu, manager of the Sundries Export Company, and Wei Tefu, deputy director of Shenxin No. 5 Factory, gave Rightist Gao Fang a powerful rebuttal. They pointed out: In the United States, there is only the democracy of reactionaries exploiting, oppressing, and persecuting people. The broad masses of working people and black people are monitored, investigated, and summoned by special agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Un-American Activities Committee. In March 1947, thousands of government employees were fired. From 1948 to February 1956, more than 100 communists were unreasonably arrested, and even the five lawyers who defended them were also implicated. In terms of the election system, some states in the United States stipulate that only those who have 40 acres of land or pay more than 300 US dollars in taxes have the right to vote. Voters in more than a dozen states in the United States must be able to write English, and even have to take an exam; other restrictions include property, length of residence, women, and so on. What kind of democracy is this! As for the situation in Britain? Britain stipulates that each candidate must pay a deposit of 150 pounds, and if they do not get one-eighth of the votes, the deposit will be confiscated. The Western parliament elected under this election system is of course a ruling tool of the monopoly bourgeoisie, and can only reflect the will of the bourgeoisie. In the last parliament in Britain, the House of Commons had 625 seats, including 173 capitalists, 95 lawyers, 51 military officers and bureaucrats, 132 bourgeois experts, 140 Labor Party rightists, and 34 others. They all represent the ruling class, so what democracy is there? As for the members of the House of Lords, they are all nobles appointed by the British Emperor, so there is even less talk of democracy. The so-called Western democracy and freedom is like this. Yan Ersheng compared the elections in the two eras before and after liberation with his own experience: When the Kuomintang reactionaries elected representatives to the Puppet National Assembly, reactionary bureaucrats and hooligans created fake elections, and the names of the voters were copied from the registers of prisoners in prisons. The reactionaries also stipulated that fingerprints should be affixed to the ballots. So that group of guys who created fake elections took pictures of the fingerprints, made zinc plates, and stamped them on blank ballots like rubber stamps, stacking them up and stuffing them into the ballot boxes. In addition, using banquets of expensive dishes, noodles, and cigarettes to solicit votes was even more common, which was truly ugly. After liberation, our elections take care of all aspects, consider representation, preliminarily negotiate candidates, ask voters to discuss and revise, freely elect, and secretly vote. Comparing the past and the present, there is a world of difference. Is this really "cotton sampling"?

The Rightist was Rendered Speechless

What kind of person is Rightist Gao Fang? It turns out that he joined the Kuomintang in 1922. When the Kuomintang reactionaries carried out a massacre of the revolutionary people in the April 12th Incident in 1927, he was a member of the Shanghai Kuomintang Purge Committee. After that, he successively held important positions in the Kuomintang. His last experience was as the director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Bank. Gao Fang's signature is on the 50-yuan to 500,000-yuan puppet gold yuan coupons.

At the meeting on the 21st, people also asked Rightist Gao Fang to stand up and argue. But in the face of truth, he was at a loss for words and had to admit his guilt, with nothing else to say.

    这次辩论进行得好
    ——介绍上海工商界对右派分子高方的说理斗争——
    据上海新民报晚刊和解放日报消息：上海市工商界反右派斗争正在胜利地发展着。21日下午，市工商联和民建会召开了执委扩大联席会议，和统益纱厂总管理处副总经理高方进行了一次大规模的说理斗争，用摆事实、讲道理的方法，彻底驳倒了这个有三十年反人民历史、曾任伪中央银行发行局局长的右派分子的谬论。这次大会是上海工商界进行反右派斗争以来最盛大的一次会议，到会的近千人。发言者极为踊跃。他们的反驳有充分的说服力，是反右派的说理斗争的一个生动的范例。
    只有走社会主义道路经济才能迅速发展
    右派分子高方是一直攻击社会主义、宣扬资本主义的。他有一系列的反动理论，其中之一就是从根本上反对我们走社会主义道路。他曾经说过：“解放前的中国经济是一个半殖民地的畸形的经济制度，不是真正的资本主义的经济制度。社会主义的经济制度必须在高度发展的资本主义经济制度的祖先基业上才能够迅速发展。中国今天没有这个条件，所以还得要补课。”右派分子高方嘴里的所谓“补课”，就是叫嚣要我们回到资本主义的老路上去，不走社会主义的道路。
    高方的这个反动理论，在21日的大会上被棉纺公司业务室副主任庞鉴勋用这样的事实驳得粉碎。庞鉴勋说：在目前的社会主义阵营里，除了民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克外，那一个国家在革命前有高度发展的资本主义经济基础呢？苏联在1913年，工业生产总值只有工农业生产总值的40％多一些，其后经过第一次世界大战和三年的国内革命战争，到1920年实行新经济政策的时候，工业已经濒于破产了。但是勤劳勇敢的苏联劳动人民，终于赤手空拳地建立了世界上第一个强大的社会主义国家。到今天，苏联经济的发展已经高于美国以外的任何一个资本主义国家。其他的多数社会主义国家，革命前工业基础也是非常薄弱的，现在都有了巨大的发展。我们中国的情况又怎样呢？拿钢铁产量来说，1949年我们年产钢铁十五万八千吨。八年后的今天，迅速增长为五百三十五万吨，增长达三十四倍之多。这里面生产量从一百万吨增加为四百万吨的经过时间是四年半，而在日本是十一年，美国是十七年，英国是二十二年，法国要四十八年。
    庞鉴勋拆穿了右派分子高方的阴谋说：事实很清楚，只有在社会主义制度下，国家经济才能得到这样空前速度的发展。高方之所以颠倒黑白，是要想把我们在社会主义的道路上拉回去，妄图动摇我们的根本，达到他要资本主义在中国复辟的罪恶目的。
    社会主义的生产动力，不如资本主义吗？
    高方污蔑说：“社会主义制度的生产动力是靠宣教和运动，不及资本主义的生产动力利用自私心理来得自然。”
    庞鉴勋痛斥了高方的这个荒唐的论点。他说：就是以高方所从事的棉纺业来说，上海市公私合营的棉纺厂，在私营时（1949年）的棉纱总产量是三十四万八千件，而在实行公私合营后（1956年），企业一具有社会主义性质，棉纱总产量就达到八十六万七千件，增加了一倍半；劳动生产率，在1949年二十支纱的千锭时平均单位产量是一六点五六公斤，1956年达到二五点三一公斤，增加了53％。他责问高方说：这是事实吧？是社会主义生产动力大呢，还是资本主义“利用自私心理”的生产动力大呢？庞鉴勋说：由于社会主义生产的目的是为了全体人民物质和文化生活的不断增长和提高，个人利益和社会利益是完全一致的，因而全体人民才能够忘我地劳动和发挥无穷的智慧，这就是社会主义生产的无限动力。你能说这是假的或是勉强的吗？
    高方污蔑我国发展社会主义经济、积累建设社会主义资金的根本办法——增产节约是“乡下老太婆的经济”。潘襄德用申新九厂的增产节约成就，驳斥了高方的谬论。
    申新九厂今年增产节约指标是一百六十六万元，由于工人群众发挥生产积极性，单是上半年就增产节约了一百零五万七千元，完成全年计划的63.4％，因而生产成本大大降低，为国家积累了大量资金。潘襄德叫着高方的名字问他：你说说看，这是“乡下老太婆的经济”吗？增产节约建设社会主义，正是为了全体人民和祖国的长远利益，你根据什么说这是“节我的约，浪你的费，节今天的约，浪将来的费，节单位的约，浪大众的费”呢？
    从储蓄方面看社会主义优越性
    右派分子高方污蔑说：“人民失去了储蓄的对象和储蓄的目的。”从事银行工作二十八年的公私合营银行经理孙瑞璜指出：这句话只能适用于高方当伪中央银行发行局局长的时期，而今天的事实却完全相反。他回顾解放前的历史说：1937年6月——1949年5月，伪法币发行额增加了一千七百六十八亿倍。这是一个天文学的数字，人民生活和国民经济遭到无法估计的损失。从1937年起的十年中，伪法币币值的变化是：1937年一百元伪法币可以买到二条大牛，1938年还可以买一条大牛、一条小牛，1939年只能买一条大牛，1940年只能买一条小牛了，1941年少到只能买一口猪，1942年则降低到一只火腿的价钱，1943年以后币值跌得更惨，由可买一只鸡、一小袋米、一条鱼、一只蛋，1947年一直跌到一百元伪法币只能买五分之一根油条了。在那个年代里，人民的膏血被榨干了，那里还有人储蓄。而解放后就完全是另有一番新气象。人民储蓄事业蓬勃发展，这是由于具备了物价稳定和生活温饱有余两个基本条件。
    八年来人民存储金额的增长是：1949年一千零零七万，1950年一亿一千万，1951年四亿七千万，1952年八亿四千万，1953年十二亿，1954年十四亿，1955年十六亿九千万，1956年二十二亿三千万，今年到6月底止已达到了二十四亿八千万，目前已超过了二十五亿。银行存户共有二千三百六十八万户，接近于全国职工总人数，差不多人人都有储蓄。存期到1956年止，平均为一百二十八天，存款类别定期存款占70％。孙瑞璜还算了这样一笔账给右派分子高方听：从1906年中国开始有银行办理储蓄业务，到1936年的三十年中，全国公私银行的人民存款最高额是伪法币五亿八千多万，折合黄金五百八十万两。解放后的八年中，人民存款最高额以二十四亿八千万元计算，折合黄金二千二百五十万两。两相比较，四分之一的时间，存款增加为四倍。这是一个铁一般的事实，充分说明了人民生活的逐年改善，社会主义制度优越性的所在，同时也给右派分子的恶意污蔑一记响亮的耳光。
    我们的民主自由才是人民的民主自由
    右派分子高方在政治生活上反对人民民主专政，宣扬资产阶级的“绝对民主”和“绝对自由”。他说：“西方民主才是真正民主。”他污蔑我们的选举“像棉花抽样一样”，不民主。对于这个反动谬论，杂品出口公司经理董寅初、申新五厂副厂长韦特孚，给予右派分子高方以有力的驳斥。他们指出：在美国就只有反动派剥削人、压迫人、迫害人的民主，广大劳动人民和黑人遭到联邦调查局、非美活动委员会等特务机关的监视、侦察、传讯。1947年3月，有几千个国家公务员被解雇。从1948年到1956年2月，有一百多个共产党人被无理逮捕，连为他们辩护的五位律师也连带遭了殃。在选举制度方面，美国有些州规定，要有四十英亩土地或缴纳三百美元以上税款的人才有选举权。美国有十几个州的选民要会写英文，甚至还要考试；其他如财产、居住年限、妇女等等都有限制。这是什么样的民主呀！至于英国的情况怎样呢？英国规定，每个候选人必须缴纳一百五十英镑保证金，如果得不到八分之一的票，保证金还要没收。在这种选举制度下所选出的西方议会，当然是垄断资产阶级的统治工具，也只能体现资产阶级的意志。英国上届议会，下议院有六百二十五个席位，其中资本家一百七十三席，律师九十五席，军官官僚五十一席，资产阶级专家一百三十二席，工党右派一百四十席，其他三十四席，他们都是代表统治阶级的，那有什么民主可言。至于上议院议员则全是英皇任命的贵族，那就更谈不上民主了。所谓西方的民主自由，面目就是这样。严谔声以亲身的经历把解放前后两个时代的选举作了对比：在国民党反动派选举伪国大代表时，反动官僚、流氓制造了假选举，选民的姓名都是从监狱里犯人的名册上抄下来的。反动派还规定在选票上要盖手印。于是那伙制造假选举的家伙，把指印拍了照，做了锌板，在空白选票上像盖图章那样的一叠叠盖下去，又一叠叠的塞进了投票箱。另外用请客吃大菜、吃面、吃香烟拉选票的更是比比皆是，真是丑态百出。解放后我们的选举是照顾各方面，考虑代表性，初步协商出候选人，请选民们讨论修正，自由选举，秘密投票。今昔相比，相差十万八千里，这难道是“棉花抽样”吗？
    右派分子被驳得哑口无言
    右派分子高方是怎样一个人呢？原来他在1922年就参加国民党，1927年四·一二国民党反动派对革命人民实行大屠杀时，他是上海国民党清党委员会的委员。其后历任国民党要职。他最后一项经历是担任伪中央银行发行局局长。在五十元到五十万元的伪金圆券上，就有高方的签名。
    在21日的大会上，人们也让右派分子高方起来辩论。可是在真理面前，他理屈词穷，只好承认有罪，没有别的话可说。
