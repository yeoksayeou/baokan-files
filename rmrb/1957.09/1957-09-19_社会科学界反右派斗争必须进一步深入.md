　　The Anti-Rightist Struggle in the Social Sciences Must Be Further Deepened
　　(Speech at the Symposium Held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences on September 18, 1957)
　　Guo Moruo
    At the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress, many representatives criticized the anti-socialist science program put forward by the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Subsequently, criticisms were also launched in the scientific community in the capital and many other cities across the country. In July, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium attended by more than 100 scientists, spending five days focusing on criticizing this anti-socialist science program. Through this period of struggle, the political conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists in scientific work was initially exposed, and the reactionary political features of the rightists in the scientific community were revealed to the people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, many scientific workers actively participated in this battle in various settings, demonstrating their revolutionary enthusiasm for defending the socialist scientific cause and the socialist system. This not only guaranteed the victory of the anti-rightist struggle in scientific work but also greatly enhanced the ideological and political level of many scientific workers. We believe this is a significant achievement in the anti-rightist struggle.
    However, in the previous stage of the struggle, we did not have time to expose the criminal activities of the bourgeois rightists in all aspects of scientific work before the national scientific workers and the people of the whole country, nor did we fully expose the conspiratorial activities of the bourgeois rightists in the most class-oriented scientific departments—social sciences. We believe that the previous stage of the struggle has achieved significant results, but it has not yet achieved complete victory, and we must not end the battle or withdraw midway. The symposium that the Chinese Academy of Sciences is holding today is a continuation of the symposium held in July and a further deepening and development of the anti-rightist struggle in the scientific community, especially in the social sciences. Not long ago, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successively held two symposiums, which made preliminary exposures and criticisms of the bourgeois rightists and their representatives in the social sciences who attempted to "restore" bourgeois sociology and economics, carrying out anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiratorial activities. The two symposiums held by the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences have made necessary preparations for the symposium that we are starting today.
    The Zhang-Luo Alliance's proposal of an anti-socialist scientific program is a significant action by the bourgeois rightists to launch a wild attack on the Communist Party and the socialist system. This is not an isolated action. On the one hand, this program is part of the entire political conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists. On the other hand, around this program, the bourgeois rightists have carried out a series of conspiracies and concrete activities in all aspects of scientific work, especially in social scientific work. The bourgeois rightists highly valued the proposal of the anti-socialist scientific program. On June 9, they published an editorial titled "Opening Up a New Path for Mutual Supervision" in the Guangming Daily, simultaneously with the publication of this program. This "short commentary" was directly instructed by authoritative figures in the Zhang-Luo Alliance and is sufficient to represent the views of the bourgeois rightists. The "short commentary" wrote: The Zhang-Luo Alliance's proposal of an anti-socialist scientific program not only has new significance in terms of the work direction of the democratic parties but also has new significance in terms of the working methods of the democratic parties. The "short commentary" tells us that the bourgeois rightists had long decided that in their so-called "assistance" to the Communist Party's rectification movement, they would not only "expose" the contradictions and problems within the people according to their own ideas but also put forward opinions after their "investigation and research" and "solve" the contradictions and problems within the people. It also tells us that the proposal of the anti-socialist scientific program has "enriched new content" and "opened up new paths" for the bourgeois rightists in "participating in state affairs" and "embodying mutual supervision." They also said that this was just a beginning, and that in the future, "in each period or each stage," they would seize the central issues related to national policies and policies, conduct "investigations" and "analytical research" through "organizations at all levels," and then put forward "suggestions" to further "give play" to the role of the bourgeois rightists in national life. This "short commentary" shows that the bourgeois rightists were complacent and regarded the proposal of this program as a very clever way to realize their anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy. They were prepared to refer to this approach, not only in all aspects of scientific work but also in other aspects of national work, such as cultural and educational work, political and legal work, financial and economic work, etc., to widely apply similar methods. Don't the facts revealed in various aspects over the past few months sufficiently illustrate that this is the case?
    Now let's talk about the problems in the social sciences. In the anti-socialist scientific program, there is a chapter called "On Social Science Issues." In this chapter, the rightists raised several fundamental issues. First, they raised the question of whether social science should be valued, saying that "social science is not unimportant and should have corresponding development." Fei Xiaotong, an important figure behind the scenes in drafting this program, also raised a related question at the propaganda work conference convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on March 12. He said, "Many people are worried that social science has no future." It was not until he heard Chairman Mao Zedong's report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at the Supreme State Council that he suddenly realized that social science still has a future. Isn't this very strange? Our social science, the Marxist social science, as a guide to revolutionary action, once guided our democratic revolution and socialist revolution to great victory, and is now guiding the smooth progress of our great socialist construction. The Communist Party and the People's Government always use Marxism-Leninism to oppose bourgeois reactionary ideology and educate the people. They have always advocated and encouraged social science research, and last year they also formulated a twelve-year perspective plan for the development of philosophy and social science. Why is it that now the question of whether the Communist Party and the People's Government value social science has suddenly arisen? Why does the question of whether social science has a future arise? It's not strange at all, because the "social science" in the minds of the rightists is not Marxist social science at all, but the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie. The purpose of raising this question is to ask the Communist Party and the People's Government to vigorously develop the so-called "social science" of the bourgeoisie.
    Second, they more directly raised the question of what attitude should be adopted towards bourgeois "social science." The anti-socialist scientific program wrote: "To develop social science, we must first change our attitude towards the old social science." They accused that "some people think" that "there is no social science in bourgeois society, because what was called 'social science' in the past is unscientific," that "social science in socialist society must be created from scratch, with nothing to inherit," that "for bourgeois social science, there is only criticism, no acceptance," and that "the old social science is not transformed, but cancelled," and so on. They also actively advocated: "What should be restored should be restored immediately, and what should be valued should be valued." Fei Xiaotong also spoke at a symposium convened by the Minmeng's organ journal "Zhengming" monthly on April 5, saying: "To develop social science, there are still many basic cognitive problems to clarify," "There are many problems," but "the key is how we treat the old social science. If this attitude problem is not resolved, the strength of those who have engaged in social science in the past cannot be brought into play." Here, the rightists presumptuously demanded that the Communist Party and the People's Government "change" their attitude towards bourgeois "social science."
    Marxism-Leninism's attitude towards bourgeois so-called "social science" has always been: to use the viewpoint and method of historical materialism to analyze the academic culture of all classes in history in a pragmatic way and give it a scientific evaluation, discarding the erroneous and reactionary dross, and critically absorbing all useful heritage. Even when the bourgeoisie played a revolutionary role in history, they could not establish true social science due to the limitations of their narrow exploiting class interests. After they became the reactionary ruling class, their so-called "social science" was only to maintain the capitalist exploitation system and oppose the proletarian revolutionary movement and the independent movement of oppressed nations. Therefore, the Communist Party of China and all Marxists can only adopt a principle of negation towards the reactionary philosophy and reactionary "social science" of the modern bourgeoisie, including sociology, economics, political science, law, history, etc., both in the past and now. But the bourgeois rightists openly demanded that we change this attitude, and used all despicable means to insult, slander, and uglify the truth of Marxism-Leninism, attempting to overthrow the fighting banner of Marxism-Leninism, in order to pave the way for the restoration of bourgeois "social science" and the restoration of bourgeois reactionary rule. Can we make the slightest concession on this issue?
    Third, they further proposed using bourgeois "social science" to guide the various tasks of our country. They said that we have a "tendency to regard policies and measures or government decrees as objective laws," and that "for some important financial and economic policy issues, if the负责人of government departments have made reports, scholars can only do some publicity and explanation work." Here, on the one hand, they slandered that the policies and measures of the Communist Party and the government are blind, rather than based on objective laws. On the other hand, they slandered that the Communist Party and the government do not allow "scholars" to engage in scientific research, but only allow them to do some "publicity and explanation work" on policies. Is this the case? Leaving aside the fact that the policies and decrees of the Party and the government embody objective laws, and leaving aside the fact that many social science researchers regard publicizing and explaining the policies of the Party and the government as their glorious duty, we now only ask the rightist gentlemen: when did the Party and the government prohibit "social science researchers" from conducting research on objective economic laws? What else can the shameless rumors of the bourgeois rightists prove besides proving that they have ulterior motives? The reason why they slander and attack the various tasks of the country led by the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism to the utmost is to create excuses for the bourgeois rightists to participate in the formulation of important national policies and decrees. They said that "since the founding of the country," "the policies and policies adopted in the political and legal, financial and economic fields" are not "without shortcomings." The "social science researchers" of the bourgeois rightists should be encouraged to "pay attention to investigation and research work," "provide opinions on government policies and regulations," and "government departments should take the initiative to provide relevant materials to relevant social science researchers as much as possible, and help them create conditions for research work." This is an important step for the bourgeois rightists to attempt to change the socialist direction of various tasks in our country and seize the leadership of the entire work of the country.
    Gentlemen! The essence of the questions raised by the anti-socialist science program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in the social sciences is roughly like this. But the problem is by no means limited to this. The problem is that they not only put forward such a program, but also, before this program was put forward, they had already been brewing and promoting the basic ideas of this program in various occasions, and carried out many organizational activities to further concretize and develop the content of this program from sociology, economics, law, and other aspects. This makes the reactionary nature of this anti-socialist science program more distinct and the adverse effects more serious.
    Regarding the issue of the so-called "restoration" of old sociology by the bourgeois rightists, I would like to ask you to take a look at an article by Fei Xiaotong published in Wenhui Daily on February 20 entitled "A Few Words on Sociology." In this article, Fei Xiaotong said that he did not pay attention to whether the signboard of "sociology" was restored, and what he really cared about was to actually use bourgeois sociology to conduct "social investigations" to "study" "a series of issues related to the people's democratic dictatorship," such as: "The relationship of co-operation between the Party and non-Party," "The political relationship between people after the elimination of classes," "The application of the People's Congress system," "Mutual supervision of democratic parties," "Ideological changes of intellectuals," "The use and arrangement of talents" and "Personnel management system" and other issues. Fei Xiaotong's articles fully demonstrate the true intention of advocating the "restoration" of sociology. This proposition is completely in line with the entire political conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. As everyone knows, the questions raised by Fei Xiaotong are precisely the main topics of the anti-communist and anti-socialist activities of the bourgeois rightists during this period. The reason why the rightists pay attention to "the relationship between the Party and non-Party" and "the political relationship between people" is to incite non-Party people to rise up against the Communist Party. The reason why the rightists pay attention to "the application of the People's Congress system" is to replace our People's Congress system with the bourgeois state system, such as adopting a "bicameral system." The reason why the rightists pay attention to "mutual supervision of democratic parties" is to use democratic parties to confront the Communist Party on an equal footing, so that the democratic parties become tools to oppose the Communist Party's leadership over the country. The reason why the rightists pay attention to the issue of intellectuals is to oppose the ideological transformation of intellectuals and lead intellectuals onto the road of anti-communism and anti-socialism. The reason why the rightists want to discuss issues such as "the use and arrangement of talents" and "personnel management system" is even more obvious. Aren't they shouting that we have not fully "brought into play" the "strength" of the rightist intellectuals? Aren't they focusing their fire on attacking our personnel system, creating an excuse for the bourgeois rightist intellectuals to come out and meddle in the decision-making of national work? Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, Li Jinghan, and other rightist elements who actively advocated the "restoration" of bourgeois sociology all emphasized their so-called "social investigations." What is their intention? We only need to look at such facts to know the news: Luo Longji, Huang Shaohong, Tan Tiwu, and other rightist ringleaders are also using their identities as people's representatives and members of the CPPCC to go out for "inspections," that is, "investigations," taking the opportunity to catch wind and capture shadows, distort the truth, and use it as capital for anti-communist and anti-socialist activities? Aren't Fei Xiaotong's recently published "Revisiting Jiangcun" and Li Jinghan's "The Past and Present of the Family Life of Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing" all distorting the facts in the name of "rural investigations," slandering agricultural cooperativization, and doing their best to provoke the relationship between farmers and the government and the relationship between workers and peasants? Aren't all these living portrayals of their criminal acts of carrying out anti-communist and anti-socialist activities under the guise of "social investigations"?
    Now it is very clear that the purpose of the bourgeois rightists in "restoring" bourgeois sociology is not anything else, but to realize the anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance; it is to oppose and replace the Marxist-Leninist worldview with the reactionary worldview of the bourgeoisie; it is to provoke and expand contradictions everywhere and attack the Party and socialism; it is to organize and mobilize reactionary forces, prepare conditions, and gradually realize the heinous political conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists, create chaos in the world, shake the people's political power and socialist system led by the Communist Party, force the Communist Party to "step down," and realize the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, we say that the bourgeois rightists' advocacy of "restoring" bourgeois sociology is not a problem within the scope of academia, but a major political conspiracy.
    The purpose of the bourgeois rightists in attempting to "restore" bourgeois economics is the same. Their attempt is concentratedly expressed in the programmatic document "Some Opinions on the Current Economic Science Work" drafted by the rightist Chen Zhenhan. Chen Zhenhan, following the will of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, first launched a large-scale attack on our country's socialist economic construction work led by the Communist Party of China, saying that our country's economic construction work, including planning work, financial work, financial work, etc., is "blind" and has not followed any objective economic laws at all, resulting in large deviations, many mistakes, and not small losses. According to Chen Zhenhan, one reason for this is that Marxist-Leninist political economics has become an "outdated" "worn-out shoe" and cannot guide the current national economic work. On the other hand, it is because the responsible personnel of our national economic departments do not understand economic common sense and are doctrinaireists, empiricists, bureaucrats, and sectarianists. Isn't this situation terrible? So what should we do? Chen Zhenhan, on behalf of the bourgeois rightists, replied: This is very easy to do! The first point of his method is: since Marxist political economics is already outdated, "should be discarded if it is a worn-out shoe," simply throw it away and replace it with bourgeois economics, especially Keynes's economic theory, which is the defender of modern monopoly capital, and use it as the guiding ideology of national economic work. The second point of the method is: since the responsible personnel of the current national economic work departments cannot bear the heavy responsibility of leadership, then simply ask them to step down and let this group of bourgeois rightist "economists" or people who like this group of "economists" come to power. Economic work should be done in this way, and the teaching and research work of economic science should also be done in this way. Chen Zhenhan's "opinion" has been revised several times, with thousands of words, and its main content is actually like this.
    Based on the facts mentioned above, may I ask the rightist gentlemen: Aren't your propositions for "restoring" bourgeois sociology and bourgeois economics a component and concretization of the anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo Alliance? Isn't it part of the major political conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists? It is difficult to justify a negative answer.
    Gentlemen! Since the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to ensure the prosperity and development of scholarship, our scientific workers have wholeheartedly supported this policy and resolutely implemented this policy in our practical work. When the reactionary political features of some rightist elements had not yet been exposed, although they showed nostalgia for the old sociology, we still arranged their work as appropriately as possible, hoping that they could contribute useful knowledge and ability, do something beneficial to socialism and the people, and gradually transform themselves in their work, but these rightist elements failed our expectations. Academic research is one thing, and engaging in anti-communist and anti-socialist activities in the name of academic research is another. There is a clear boundary between these two, and this boundary must not be confused. Now some rightist elements are trying to confuse this boundary, reverse black and white, and confuse the public, which is not allowed.
    Among our scientific workers, the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie is relatively deep. After several years of ideological transformation, most people have made progress. For a scientific worker with strong bourgeois ideas to completely abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview is a difficult and long-term process. In this transformation process, there are inevitably still remnants of old ideas. The important thing is to constantly and consciously use new ideas to overcome old ideas. But the rightist elements are not like this at all. They adhere to reactionary positions and viewpoints, are full of hostility towards the new society, are enemies of the people everywhere, and come out to oppose the people's political power and the socialist system whenever they have the opportunity. People who only have some wrong ideas are, of course, not to be confused with rightist elements who stand on a reactionary position politically. The anti-rightist struggle has made all our scientific workers more deeply aware of the importance and necessity of ideological transformation. Philosophy and social science are sciences with particularly strong class nature and Party nature. Philosophy and social science workers directly shoulder the task of conducting ideological education for the people, and should more earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, thoroughly transform their own thinking, truly stand under the banner of Marxist-Leninist truth, and fight for the great cause of socialism and communism.
    What we are now carrying out is a struggle between two roads, socialism and capitalism, a struggle between two roads, the continued victory of Marxism-Leninism and the restoration of bourgeois reactionary political and social thought. A struggle of this nature cannot but be very sharp. I believe that all the philosophers, social scientists, and natural scientists present will be able to expose and criticize the rightist elements in the spirit of seeking truth from facts and adhering to the principle of reasoning and struggle. At the same time, we hope that the anti-rightist struggle in the social sciences can be further carried out and deepened throughout the country. Finally, we hope that the rightist elements in the scientific community will not completely fail the expectations of the people, and will be able to repent and thoroughly confess their crimes in order to obtain the opportunity to be a new person.

　　社会科学界反右派斗争必须进一步深入
　　（1957年9月18日在中国科学院召开的座谈会上的讲话）
　　郭沫若
    在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上，许多代表曾经对章罗联盟提出的反社会主义科学纲领进行了批判。接着在首都和全国许多城市的科学界中也展开了批判。七月间，中国科学院召开的有一百多位科学家参加的座谈会，费了五天工夫，集中地批判了这个反社会主义的科学纲领。经过这一时期的斗争，资产阶级右派在科学工作方面的政治阴谋初步被揭发出来了，科学界的右派分子的反动政治面目在人们面前暴露了。在中国共产党的领导下，许多科学工作者在各个场合积极参加了这个战斗，表现了保卫社会主义的科学事业、保卫社会主义制度的革命积极性。这就既保证了科学工作方面的反右派斗争的胜利，又大大提高了许多科学工作者的思想政治水平。我们认为，这是反右派斗争中的一个重大的成就。
    但是，在前一阶段的斗争中，我们还没有来得及在全国科学工作者面前，在全国人民面前，揭发资产阶级右派在科学工作各方面的罪恶活动，还没有充分揭露资产阶级右派在具有最强烈的阶级性的科学部门——社会科学工作方面的阴谋活动。我们认为，前一阶段的斗争已经取得了重大的成绩，但是尚未获得全胜，我们决不能就此结束战斗，中途收兵。中国科学院召开的今天开始的这个座谈会，是七月间举行的座谈会的继续，是科学界，特别是社会科学界反右派斗争进一步的深入和发展。就在不久以前，中国科学院哲学社会科学部先后召开了两个座谈会，分别对资产阶级右派及其在社会科学方面的代表人物企图“恢复”资产阶级社会学和经济学，进行反共反社会主义的阴谋活动，作了初步的揭发和批判。哲学社会科学部召开的这两个座谈会，为我们今天开始的这个座谈会作了必要的准备。
    章罗联盟提出反社会主义的科学纲领，是资产阶级右派向共产党和社会主义制度发动猖狂进攻的一个具有严重意义的行动。这不是一个孤立的行动，一方面，这个纲领是资产阶级右派整个政治阴谋的组成部分，另一方面，围绕着这个纲领，资产阶级右派在科学工作，特别是社会科学工作的各个方面，都进行了一系列阴谋策划和具体活动。资产阶级右派对于提出反社会主义的科学纲领这件事，作了很高的估价。他们在六月九日光明日报上，和发表这个纲领的同时发表了一篇题为“为互相监督开拓了新路”的“短评”。这篇“短评”是章罗联盟中的权威人士直接授意写的，足以代表资产阶级右派的意见。“短评”写道：章罗联盟提出反社会主义的科学纲领，不仅从民主党派的工作方向来说，具有新的意义，而且从民主党派的工作方式来说，也有新的意义。“短评”告诉我们，资产阶级右派早已决定，在他们的所谓“协助”共产党整风中，不仅要按照他们的设想“揭露”人民内部的矛盾和问题，而且要经过他们“调查研究”之后，提出意见，由他们来“解决”人民内部的矛盾和问题。并且告诉我们，反社会主义的科学纲领的提出，为资产阶级右派在“参与国是”“体现相互监督”等方面，“丰富了新的内容”和“开拓了新的道路”。他们并且说，这还只是一个开端，以后“在每一时期或每一阶段”，都要抓住有关国家方针政策的中心问题，经过“各级组织”，去“调查”和“分析研究”，然后提出“建议”，以进一步“发挥”资产阶级右派在国家生活中的作用。这篇“短评”表明，资产阶级右派自鸣得意，把提出这个纲领看做是实现他们的反共反社会主义阴谋的一种十分高明的手法。他们准备参照这种做法，不仅在科学工作的各个方面，而且在国家工作的其他方面，例如在文教工作方面，政法工作方面，财经工作方面等等，广泛施展类似的手段。几个月以来各方面揭露出来的事实，难道不足以说明事情正是这样吗？
    我们现在单就社会科学方面的问题来谈一谈。反社会主义科学纲领中，有一章叫做“关于社会科学的问题”。在这一章里，右派提出了几个根本性的问题。第一，他们提出了应不应当重视社会科学的问题，说“社会科学并不是不重要，也应该有相应的发展”。起草这个纲领的幕后重要人物费孝通，三月十二日在中共中央召开的宣传工作会议上，也提出了与此有关的问题，他说，“很多人耽心社会科学没有前途”，一直到他听了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上作了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告以后，他才恍然大悟：原来社会科学还有前途。这不是很奇怪吗？我们的社会科学，马克思主义的社会科学，作为革命行动的指南，曾经指导了我国民主革命和社会主义革命取得了伟大胜利，现在正在指导我国伟大的社会主义建设的顺利进行。共产党和人民政府历来以马克思列宁主义来反对资产阶级的反动思想，教育人民。并且一直提倡和鼓励社会科学的研究，去年还制订了发展哲学社会科学的十二年远景计划。为什么现在突然会发生共产党和人民政府重视不重视社会科学的问题呢？为什么居然会发生社会科学有没有前途的问题呢？原来并不奇怪，因为右派心目中的“社会科学”，根本不是马克思主义的社会科学，而是资产阶级的所谓“社会科学”。他们这样提出问题，目的就在要求共产党和人民政府大力发展资产阶级的所谓“社会科学”。
    第二，他们更直截了当地提出了对资产阶级“社会科学”应该采取什么态度的问题。反社会主义的科学纲领写道：“要发展社会科学，首先要改变对待旧社会科学的态度”。他们指责说，“有人认为”，“资产阶级社会里没有社会科学可言，因为过去被称为‘社会科学’的东西都是不科学的”，“社会主义社会里的社会科学要从头创造，没有可继承的”，“对于资产阶级社会科学只有批判，谈不到接受”，“对旧社会科学不是改造，而是取消”等等。他们并且积极主张：“应该恢复的应即采取步骤予以恢复，应当重视的就应当重视起来”。也是费孝通，四月五日在民盟的机关刊物“争鸣”月刊召集的座谈会上发言，他说：“要发展社会科学，还有许多基本的认识问题要澄清一下”，“问题是不少的”，但“关键还是在我们怎样对待旧的社会科学，这个态度问题不解决，那些过去搞过社会科学的人的力量还是发挥不出来的”。在这里，右派居然狂妄地要求共产党和人民政府“改变”对资产阶级“社会科学”的态度。
    马克思列宁主义对待资产阶级的所谓“社会科学”的态度历来是：用历史唯物主义的观点方法，实事求是地分析历史上一切阶级的学术文化，并且给以科学的评价，抛弃其中错误的反动的糟粕，批判地吸收一切有用的遗产。资产阶级即使当他们在历史上还起着革命作用的时候，由于他们的狭隘的剥削阶级利益的限制，他们尚且不可能建立真正的社会科学，到了他们成为反动的统治阶级以后，他们的所谓“社会科学”，更只是为了维护资本主义剥削制度，反对无产阶级革命运动和被压迫民族的独立运动。因此，中国共产党和一切马克思主义者对于现代资产阶级的反动的哲学和反动的“社会科学”，包括社会学、经济学、政治学、法律学、历史学等等，不论过去和现在，都只能采取原则否定的态度。但是资产阶级右派居然公开要求我们改变这种态度，并且用一切卑鄙的手段，来辱骂、污蔑和丑化马克思列宁主义的真理，企图打倒马克思列宁主义这面战斗的旗帜，以便为资产阶级“社会科学”的复辟，为资产阶级反动统治的复辟，铺平道路。在这个问题上，我们难道能够作丝毫的让步吗？
    第三，他们进一步提出用资产阶级的“社会科学”来指导我们国家的各项工作的问题。他们说，我们有“把政策措施或政府法令当成客观规律”的“偏向”，并且说，“有些财经上的重要政策问题，如果政府部门的负责人作过报告，学者们也就只能作些宣传解释工作”。他们在这里，一方面污蔑共产党和政府的政策措施等等都是盲目的，而不是依据客观规律的，另一方面又污蔑共产党和政府不准“学者们”从事科学研究，只准他们作些政策方面的“宣传解释工作”。事实是这样吗？暂且不说党和政府的政策法令是体现着客观规律的，也暂且不说许许多多的社会科学研究工作者，是把宣传解释党和政府的政策，作为自己光荣的职责的，现在我们只问问右派先生们：党和政府究竟在什么时候禁止过“社会科学研究工作者”对客观经济规律进行研究呢？资产阶级右派的无耻造谣，除了证明他们别有用心以外，还能证明什么呢？他们之所以这样对共产党领导的国家各项工作，对马克思列宁主义，极尽污蔑攻击之能事，其目的就是为资产阶级右派参与制订国家的重要政策法令制造借口。他们说，“开国以来”，“在政法、财经等方面，所采取的方针政策”，不是“毫无缺点的”。应该鼓励资产阶级右派的“社会科学研究工作者”“重视调查研究工作”，“对政府的政策法令提供意见”，“政府部门应主动地将有关材料尽量供给有关的社会科学研究工作者，并帮助他们创造研究工作的条件”。这是资产阶级右派图谋改变我们国家各项工作的社会主义方向，夺取国家整个工作领导权的重要步骤。
    各位先生！章罗联盟提出的反社会主义科学纲领在社会科学方面提出的问题的实质大致就是这样。但是问题决不仅限于此。问题还在于，他们不仅提出了这样一个纲领，而且早在这个纲领提出以前，他们就已经在各个场合酝酿和宣传这个纲领的基本思想，并且进行了许多组织活动，把这个纲领的内容，从社会学、经济学、法律学等等方面，加以进一步的具体化和发挥。这就使得这个反社会主义科学纲领的反动性质更加鲜明，所起的恶劣影响更加严重。
    关于资产阶级右派所谓“恢复”旧社会学的问题，我想请大家看一看费孝通二月二十日发表在文汇报上的一篇题为“关于社会学，说几句话”的文章。在这篇文章里，费孝通表示，“社会学”这块牌子是否恢复，他并不重视，他所真正关心的是要在实际上用资产阶级社会学来进行“社会调查”，来“研究”“有关人民民主专政的一系列问题”，例如：“党和非党的共事合作关系”，“阶级消灭后的人和人的政治关系”，“人民代表大会制的运用”，“民主党派的相互监督”，“知识分子的思想变化”，“人才的使用和安排”与“人事管理制度”等等问题。费孝通的这些文章充分表明了主张“恢复”社会学的真正用意，这种主张和章罗联盟的整个政治阴谋完全合拍。正如大家所知道的，费孝通所提出的这些问题正是资产阶级右派这个时期中反共反社会主义的主要题目。右派所以注意“党和非党的关系”，“人和人的政治关系”，就是要煽动党外人士起来反对共产党。右派所以注意“人民代表大会制的运用”，就是要用资产阶级的国家制度，来代替我们的人民代表大会制度，例如采用“两院制”之类。右派所以注意“民主党派的相互监督”，就是为了用民主党派来和共产党分庭抗礼，以至使民主党派成为反对共产党对国家的领导的工具。右派所以注意知识分子问题，就是为了反对知识分子的思想改造，把知识分子引上反共反社会主义的道路。右派之所以要讨论什么“人才的使用和安排”，“人事管理制度”等问题，意思那就更明显了。他们不是大喊大叫我们没有充分“发挥”右派知识分子的“力量”吗？他们不是集中火力来攻击我们的人事制度，造成口实，好让资产阶级右派知识分子出来染指国家工作的决策吗？费孝通、吴景超、陈达、李景汉等这些积极主张“恢复”资产阶级社会学的右派分子，都十分强调他们的所谓“社会调查”，他们的用意又是什么呢？我们只要看一看这样一些事实，便知此中消息：罗隆基、黄绍竑、谭惕吾等等右派首脑人物，不也是利用人民代表和政协委员的身份出去“视察”，也就是“调查”，乘机捕风捉影，歪曲真象，作为反共反社会主义的资本吗？最近发表的费孝通的“重访江村”和李景汉的“北京郊区农民家庭生活的今昔”这两篇所谓“调查报告”，不全是假借“农村调查”之名，大肆歪曲事实，污蔑农业合作化，极尽挑拨农民和政府的关系，挑拨工农关系之能事吗？所有这些，难道不是他们在“社会调查”的幌子下，进行反共反社会主义的罪恶勾当的活生生的写照吗？
    现在看得很清楚，资产阶级右派所以要“恢复”资产阶级社会学，其目的不是别的，是为了实现章罗联盟的反社会主义科学纲领；是为了以资产阶级反动的世界观来反对并代替马克思列宁主义的世界观；是为了到处挑拨和扩大矛盾，向党向社会主义进攻；是为了组织和动员反动力量，准备条件，逐步实现资产阶级右派的穷凶极恶的政治阴谋，造成天下大乱，动摇共产党领导的人民政权和社会主义制度，迫使共产党“下台”，实现资本主义复辟。所以我们说，资产阶级右派主张“恢复”资产阶级社会学，不是什么学术范围以内的问题，而是一种重大的政治阴谋。
    资产阶级右派企图“恢复”资产阶级经济学，其目的也是一样。他们的这个企图，集中地表现在右派分子陈振汉草拟的“我们对于当前经济科学工作的一些意见”这一纲领性的文件中。陈振汉秉承章罗联盟的意旨，首先对中国共产党领导的我国社会主义经济建设工作大肆攻击，说我们国家的经济建设工作，其中包括计划工作、财政工作、金融工作等等，都是“盲目的”，根本没有遵循什么客观经济规律，以致偏差颇大，错误很多，损失不小。其所以如此，据陈振汉说，一方面是因为马克思列宁主义政治经济学已经成为“过了时”的“敝屣”，不能指导当前的国家经济工作，另一方面是因为，我们的国家经济部门的负责人员不懂得经济学常识，是一些教条主义者、经验主义者、官僚主义者和宗派主义者。这个局面岂不是糟糕透顶吗？那末怎么办才好呢？陈振汉代表资产阶级右派回答：这好办得很！他的办法的第一条是：马克思主义政治经济学然既早已过时，“是敝屣就应摒弃”，干脆把它扔掉，改用资产阶级的经济学，特别是现代垄断资本的辩护人凯因斯的经济学说，把它作为国家的经济工作的指导思想就好了。办法的第二条是：现在的国家经济工作部门的负责人员，既然不能担负领导的重任，那末干脆请他们下台，让这批资产阶级右派的“经济学家”或者喜欢这批“经济学家”的人上台就好了。经济工作方面应该如此这般，经济科学的教学和研究工作方面，也应该如此这般。陈振汉的“意见书”数易其稿，洋洋数千言，其主要内容，事实上就是这样。
    根据以上所说的这些事实，请问右派先生们：你们的“恢复”资产阶级社会学和资产阶级经济学的主张，不正是章罗联盟的反社会主义科学纲领的组成部分及其具体化吗？不正是资产阶级右派重大的政治阴谋的一部分吗？你们要作出否定的回答，那是很难自圆其说的。
    各位先生！自从中国共产党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一保证学术的繁荣和发展的方针以来，我们科学工作者是衷心拥护这一方针的，并且在我们的实际工作中是坚决执行着这一方针的。当一些右派分子的反动政治面目还没有暴露的时候，虽然他们对旧社会学表示留恋，可是我们仍然尽可能适当安排他们的工作，期望他们能够贡献有用的知识和能力，做出一些有利于社会主义，有利于人民的事情，并且在工作中逐步改造自己，但是这些右派分子辜负了我们的期望。学术研究是一回事，假借学术研究的名义，进行反共反社会主义活动又是一回事。这中间有一条明显的界线，这条界线是绝对不能混淆的。现在有些右派分子企图混淆这条界线，颠倒黑白，淆乱视听，这是不能容许的。
    在我国的科学工作者中间，资产阶级的思想影响是比较深的。经过了几年的思想改造，大多数人都有了进步。一个有浓厚资产阶级思想的科学工作者，要彻底地抛弃资产阶级的世界观，建立无产阶级的世界观，这是一个艰难的长期的过程。在这种改造过程中，难免还有旧的思想残余。重要的是要不断自觉地用新的思想来克服旧的思想。但是右派分子却完全不是这样，他们坚持反动的立场和观点，对新社会充满敌意，处处与人民为敌，一有机会，就出来反对人民政权，反对社会主义制度。仅仅有一些错误思想的人，和在政治上站在反动立场的右派分子，当然不能混为一谈。反右派斗争，使得我们所有的科学工作者，更加深刻地认识到思想改造的重要性和必要性。哲学社会科学是阶级性党性特别强烈的科学，哲学社会科学工作者直接担负着对人民群众进行思想教育的任务，更应该认真地学习马克思列宁主义，彻底改造自己的思想，真正站到马克思列宁主义真理的旗帜下，为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业而战斗。
    现在我们所进行的，是社会主义还是资本主义这样两条道路的斗争，是马克思列宁主义的继续胜利，还是资产阶级反动的政治社会思想复辟这样两条道路的斗争。这种性质的斗争，当然不能不是十分尖锐的。我相信，到会的所有哲学家、社会科学家和自然科学家，都能够本着实事求是的精神，坚持说理斗争的原则，对右派分子进行揭发和批判。同时，我们希望社会科学界的反右派斗争，能够在全国各地进一步开展和深入。最后，我们希望科学界的右派分子最后不至于完全辜负人民的期待，能够有所悔悟，彻底交代他们的罪行，以取得重新做人的机会。
