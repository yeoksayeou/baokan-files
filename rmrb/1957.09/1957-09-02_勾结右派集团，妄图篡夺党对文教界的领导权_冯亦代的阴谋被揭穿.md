Xinhua News Agency, August 31st:

    Feng Yidai, Deputy Director of the "Chinese Literature" Editorial Department of the Foreign Languages ​​Press and a right-wing element, had his anti-Communist conspiratorial activities further exposed at the publishing industry symposiums held on the 24th, 28th, and 31st. His various anti-Communist fallacies were also fully criticized at the meetings.

    Feng Yidai is the Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League (CDL) and the Director of the CDL Branch of the Foreign Languages ​​Press. In addition to carrying out a series of conspiracies to usurp the leadership of the Foreign Languages ​​Press, he also colluded with Fei Xiaotong and Tao Dayong, major figures in the Zhang-Luo Alliance, and conspired with the Wu Zuguang right-wing clique. As a representative of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, he lit fires everywhere, attempting to usurp the Communist Party's leadership over the entire cultural and educational circles.

    After the rectification campaign began, Feng Yidai openly smeared the past relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties as "long-term coexistence, supervision by one side." In the CDL Beijing Municipal Branch, he proposed establishing a literary and art work committee and openly demanded that he be in charge of this committee. He wanted to aggressively develop CDL members in the fields of Peking opera, ballad singing, and Ping opera, and establish directly subordinate groups and branches in units such as the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Dramatists Association, the dance school, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Bureau, and the Art Bureau. He also planned to bring the CDL organizations of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Beijing Academy of Arts and Crafts, and the Film Academy under the leadership of the literary and art work committee, so that he could control the entire literary and art world and influence its trends.

    On May 31st, when Feng Yidai used the name of the CDL Beijing Municipal Branch to convene a film industry symposium to start fires, he had previously drafted a list with right-wing elements in the film industry such as Qu Yongxiang. Most of those invited to the meeting were targets of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns and elements dissatisfied with the Communist Party. Feng shook hands and exchanged greetings with almost everyone present at the symposium and incited them. Those invited to participate were picked up and dropped off by car and treated with high-grade sweets. The meeting proposed reversing the verdict on the mistake of the right-wing element Zhong Dianfei, who had started the "film gong and drum" to attack the Communist Party. The entire symposium was filled with gunpowder.

    Feng Yidai not only consistently flattered Wu Zuguang and the main members of his right-wing clique, but also conspired with Wu Zuguang to create a literary so-called "co-authored publication" that would exclusively publish rejected manuscripts from "People's Literature" and works by Western bourgeois writers, attempting to "compete head-on" with the literary publications led by the Communist Party, and to "let poisonous weeds be released to coexist peacefully with flowers." He also advocated that the Writers Association should establish a foreign literature committee, also to be controlled by him. This committee would interfere with the translation and publication of foreign literature and publish a large number of English and American bourgeois literary works indiscriminately and unconditionally to replace the literary works of Soviet and foreign progressive writers.

    Wu Han, Chairman of the CDL Beijing Municipal Branch, in his speech at the meeting, specifically criticized the reactionary words and deeds of right-wing elements who distorted and used the "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" policy to attack the Communist Party. He said that in order to realize "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," the democratic parties must submit to the leadership of the Communist Party and must adhere to serving socialism. Otherwise, "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" would lose its political foundation. Wu Han said that the right-wing elements of the democratic parties not only refused ideological remolding, but also colluded with a group of dregs of society, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and restore capitalism. What "long-term coexistence" and "mutual supervision" could there be!

    Wu Han finally pointed out that all CDL members must actively participate in this anti-rightist struggle so that the work of the democratic parties can be healthily developed again.

    Wu Wentao, President of the Foreign Languages ​​Press, and Li Qianfeng, Vice President, focused on criticizing the ideological and historical roots of Feng Yidai's degeneration into a bourgeois right-wing element in their speeches. They said that before liberation, Feng Yidai studied business at university, researching how to make a fortune through capitalist commerce. During his university years, he lived a decadent life of extravagance. Later, in order to climb up the ladder and become rich and powerful, he successively joined two reactionary gangs, did not hesitate to become sworn brothers with secret agent elements, and loyally served Ling Xianyang, a close confidant of Kong Xiangxi and a notorious secret agent, recognizing Ling as his "confidant" and "benefactor." After liberation, Feng Yidai entered the new society with the tail of extreme individualism, and always treated the Communist Party with a double-dealing approach.

    A total of more than twenty people spoke at the three meetings. They also exposed and criticized Feng Yidai's anti-Communist words and deeds in publishing work, international book distribution work, and foreign literature translation work.

### 勾结右派集团，妄图篡夺党对文教界的领导权  冯亦代的阴谋被揭穿

    勾结右派集团，妄图篡夺党对文教界的领导权
    冯亦代的阴谋被揭穿
    据新华社31日讯  外文出版社“中国文学”编辑部副主任、右派分子冯亦代的反共阴谋活动在24、28和31日分别举行的出版界座谈会上被进一步揭露，他的各种反共谬论也在会上得到充分批判。
    冯亦代是民盟北京市支部的副秘书长和外文出版社民盟支部的主任委员，他除了在外文出版社进行过一系列企图篡夺外文出版社的领导的阴谋活动以外，还曾串通章罗联盟的主将费孝通和陶大镛，并且同吴祖光右派集团相勾结，以北京市人民代表的身份到处放火，企图篡夺共产党对整个文教界的领导。
    冯亦代在整风开始后曾公开污蔑过去共产党与民主党派的关系是“长期共存、一方监督”。他在民盟北京市支部曾提出要建立文艺工作委员会，并公然要求由他来主持这个委员会，要在京剧、曲艺和评剧三界中恶性发展盟员，在文联、剧协、舞蹈学校、中央乐团、电影局和艺术局等单位建立直属小组和支部，还打算把中央美术学院、北京工艺美术学院和电影学院的盟组织都划归文艺工作委员会领导，以便他把持整个文艺界，左右文艺界的动向。
    冯亦代在5月31日利用民盟北京市支部的名义召开电影界座谈会进行放火时，事先曾和电影界右派分子区永祥等拟定名单，被邀到会的大部分是“三反”、“肃反”对象和对共产党不满的分子。冯在座谈会上几乎与所有到会者握手寒喧，并进行煽动。被邀参加人员都用汽车接送，并以高级糖果招待。这次会议曾提出要为右派分子钟惦棐敲起“电影的锣鼓”向共产党进攻的错误做翻案文章，整个座谈会充满了火药气味。
    冯亦代不但一向和吴祖光及其右派集团的主要成员互相吹捧，还和吴祖光密谋搞一个文艺性的所谓“同人刊物”，专登“人民文学”的退稿和西方资产阶级作家的作品，妄图同共产党所领导的文艺刊物“唱对台戏”，要“让毒草放出来与鲜花和平共处”。他还曾主张作协要成立外国文学委员会，也由他来把持，这个委员会要干预外国文学的翻译和出版，要无选择无条件地大量出版英美资产阶级的文学作品，以代替苏联和外国进步作家的文学作品。
    民盟北京市支部主任委员吴晗在会上的发言，对右派分子歪曲利用“长期共存、互相监督”政策向共产党进攻的反动言行专门作了批驳。他说，要实现“长期共存、互相监督”，民主党派必须服从共产党的领导，必须坚持为社会主义服务。否则，“长期共存、互相监督”就失去了政治基础。吴晗说，民主党派的右派分子不但拒绝思想改造，他们还纠合社会上的一批渣滓，企图搞垮共产党的领导，复辟资本主义，这还有甚么“长期共存”和“互相监督”可言！
    吴晗最后指出，所有民盟的成员必须积极参加这次反右派斗争，使民主党派的工作重新得到健康发展。
    外文出版社社长吴文焘和副社长李千峰的发言，着重批判了冯亦代所以堕落为资产阶级右派分子的思想和历史根源。他们说，冯亦代解放前在大学里读的是研究资本主义商业如何发财致富的商科，在大学时代就已经过着纸醉金迷的生活。后来，他为了个人向上爬，飞黄腾达，曾先后参加两个反动的帮会，不惜和特务分子结拜兄弟，并且忠心耿耿地为孔祥熙的亲信、臭名远扬的特务分子凌宪扬服务，把凌认作“知己”和“恩人”。解放后，冯亦代夹着极端个人主义的尾巴进入新社会，一向以两面派的手法对待共产党。
    在三次会上发言的共有二十多人，他们还对冯亦代在出版工作、国际书刊发行工作、外国文学翻译工作等方面的反共言行作了揭露和批判。
