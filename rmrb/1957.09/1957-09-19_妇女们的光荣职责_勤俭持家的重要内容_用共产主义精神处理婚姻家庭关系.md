Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Many mothers attending the Third National Women's Congress of China emphasized at the meeting today that educating children with the Communist spirit and correctly handling marriage and family relationships, opposing the erosion of bourgeois ideology, are among the contents of the socialist revolution on the current political and ideological fronts. It is a glorious responsibility that every mother and future mother should fulfill, and it is also an important aspect of implementing the policy of building the country and managing households through diligence and thrift.

The representatives pointed out that in the great social transformation, how to treat marriage, family, and children's education with a Communist attitude is a matter of universal concern to society. Cao Mengjun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, said at the meeting that the family is a constituent cell of society, and its health directly affects society and the country. In the short few years since liberation, profound changes have taken place in marriage and family relationships in our country. A large number of happy families with independent marriages, equality between men and women, democracy, and harmony have emerged. This new relationship of mutual respect, mutual assistance, and harmonious coexistence established between husband and wife, parents, children, and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is a concrete manifestation of socialist morality that is adapted to the socialist economic foundation.

However, Cao Mengjun said, the influence of the old system and old ideas cannot be completely eliminated in the short few years after liberation, and some shortcomings still remain in marriage and family relationships. For example, some young people still cannot correctly handle love and marriage issues, and some young people do not understand thrift and frugality in managing their households and do not recognize that doing a good job in family relations is a responsibility to society. Therefore, the Women's Federation should continue to cooperate closely with relevant units to make education on treating marriage and family with Communist morality an important part of socialist ideological education. In terms of marriage relations, we should continue to advocate the establishment of equality between men and women, mutual respect and love, and advocate solid and lasting love for the joint labor of building socialism, and oppose bourgeois marriage views such as vanity and aversion to labor. We should guide young people to correctly handle the relationship between marriage, work, and study, and advocate getting married a little later. In areas where feudal marriage customs still exist, we must continue to oppose arranged marriages, buying and selling marriages, and early marriage. In terms of family relations, we must continue to advocate the establishment of socialist families with mutual love and assistance, joint labor, respect for the elderly and love for the young, and respect for mothers-in-law and love for daughters-in-law, and advocate that parents set an example in cultivating their children's qualities of diligence, thrift, simplicity, honesty, and bravery. Finally, Cao Mengjun also proposed that the Women's Federation should provide specific guidance and assistance to young people on issues such as love, marriage, and handling family relationships when necessary.

Kang Ying, a member of the Second Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation, talked about the relationship between people under the socialist system. She emphasized that the relationship between people under the socialist system is based on Communist morality. She refuted the fallacy of the rightists who said that today's society is "unfilial." Kang Ying said that the re-understanding of the relationship between people today is part of the socialist revolution on the current political and ideological fronts.

Kang Ying also said that doing a good job in family relations is one of the important tasks of building socialism, and women play an important role in doing a good job in family relations. How to correctly handle family problems? She believes that women should maintain both principles and family harmony when getting along with their parents-in-law, parents, husbands, uncles, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, nephews, and nieces. She specifically mentioned the need to implement the policy of unity-criticism-unity, patiently help each other, and establish more harmonious families with socialist awareness.

Chen Lian, Minister of the School and Young Pioneers Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, pointed out in her speech that mothers are the first teachers of children, and also the most intimate and authoritative teachers. Chen Lian hoped that the vast majority of women, especially mothers, can take the work of educating children with the Communist spirit as an important part of implementing "building the country through diligence and thrift, and managing households through diligence and thrift."

She said that protecting children from the poison of bourgeois ideology and strengthening socialist ideological education for children are serious struggles for every mother.

Chen Lian also expressed her opinion on the issue of spoiling children. She said that children are the flowers of the motherland, but we must not cultivate them like flowers in a greenhouse. We must make them not separate from the entire social life, and appropriately let them experience some wind and rain, especially to greatly strengthen labor education for children. Educators and parents should set an example in guiding children to love labor and develop the habit of physical labor. This should be combined with their own ideological transformation and with diligence and thrift in managing households.

In the discussions in the past few days, many representatives also talked about the issue of educating children. They believed that "example is better than precept," and the success or failure of implementing diligence and thrift in managing households has a decisive significance for the growth of children. Dou Shaoqing, a family member of a railway worker in Datong City, Shanxi Province, believes based on her own personal experience that doing a good job in diligence and thrift in managing households is an effective way to cultivate children's diligent and simple style.

Li Chunpei, a "five-good" family woman in Wuhan City, usually pays attention to educating her children to develop the habit of labor. Her four school-age children all have grades of five or A, and two of them are "three-good" students. The children are appropriately assigned some housework at home.

At today's meeting, rightists Liu Wang Liming and Pu Xixiu made some confessions.

Twelve representatives spoke at today's conference, and another thirty-four representatives made written speeches.

### 妇女们的光荣职责  勤俭持家的重要内容  用共产主义精神处理婚姻家庭关系

　　妇女们的光荣职责
　　勤俭持家的重要内容
　　用共产主义精神处理婚姻家庭关系
    据新华社18日讯　出席中国妇女第三次全国代表大会的许多母亲们今天在会上强调说，以共产主义精神教育子女和正确处理婚姻家庭关系，反对资产阶级思想的侵蚀是当前政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命的内容之一，是每个母亲和未来的母亲应尽的光荣责任，也是贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针的一个重要方面。
    代表们指出，在社会大变革中，如何以共产主义态度对待婚姻、家庭及子女教育问题，是社会所普遍关心的问题。全国妇联书记处书记曹孟君在会上说，家庭是社会的组成细胞，它的健康与否，直接对社会、国家发生影响。我们国家在解放后短短的几年中，婚姻家庭关系已经发生了深刻的变化。自主婚姻，男女平等、民主和睦的幸福家庭大量出现。这种在夫妻、父母、子女、婆媳之间建立起的互敬互助和睦相处的新关系，正是同社会主义经济基础相适应的社会主义道德观念的具体体现。
    但是，曹孟君说，旧制度、旧思想的影响不可能在解放后短短几年中完全清除，在婚姻家庭关系上也还残存着一些缺点。比如有些青年还不能正确地处理恋爱婚姻问题，有些青年人还不懂得勤俭持家，不认识搞好家庭关系是对社会应尽的责任。因此，妇联应该继续和有关单位密切合作，把以共产主义道德对待婚姻家庭的教育，作为社会主义思想教育的一个重要部分。在婚姻关系方面，应当继续提倡建立男女平等，互敬互爱，提倡为建设社会主义共同劳动的巩固持久的爱情，反对爱慕虚荣、好逸恶劳等资产阶级的婚姻观点。应指导青年正确地处理婚姻、工作、学习三者之间的关系，提倡适当晚一些结婚。在还存在封建婚姻习俗的地区，要继续反对包办、买卖婚姻和早婚。在家庭关系方面，要继续提倡建立互爱互助，共同劳动，尊老爱幼，尊婆爱媳的社会主义家庭，并且提倡父母以身作则，培养子女勤俭朴素、诚实勇敢的品德。最后，曹孟君还提出，妇联在必要时，还要针对青年人在恋爱、婚姻和处理家庭关系等问题上给予具体的指导和帮助。
    全国妇联第二届执行委员会委员康英谈到了在社会主义制度下人和人的关系问题。她强调社会主义制度下人和人的关系是以共产主义道德为标准的。她驳斥了右派分子所说今天这个社会是“六亲不认”的谬论。康英说，今天人和人的关系的重新认识是当前政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命内容的一个部分。
    康英还说，搞好家庭关系是建设社会主义的重要工作之一，而妇女在搞好家庭关系上又起着重要的作用。如何正确处理家庭问题呢？她认为，妇女和公婆、父母、丈夫、叔伯、妯娌、子侄相处，既要坚持原则，又要家庭和睦。她特别谈到要贯彻团结——批评——团结的方针，相互耐心帮助，建立更多的有社会主义觉悟的和睦家庭。
    团中央学校和少先队工作部部长陈琏在发言中特别指出，母亲是少年儿童最初的教师，也是最亲密、最有权威的教师。陈琏希望广大妇女，特别是母亲们都能把以共产主义精神教育少年儿童的工作作为贯彻实施“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的一项重要内容。
    她说，保卫少年儿童免受资产阶级思想的毒害，加强对少年儿童的社会主义思想教育，是每一个做母亲的严重的斗争任务。
    陈琏还对娇惯孩子的问题发表了意见。她说，儿童是祖国的花朵，但我们可不能像暖房里的花朵那样来培育，要使他们不脱离整个社会生活，要适当地让他们经受些风雨，特别要大大加强对少年儿童的劳动教育。教育工作者和家长们都要以身作则地去引导少年儿童热爱劳动，养成体力劳动的习惯，这要和自己的思想改造相结合，和勤俭持家相结合。
    在这几天的讨论中，还有很多代表谈到了教育子女的问题，她们认为，“言教不如身教”，勤俭持家贯彻执行的好坏，对子女的成长有着决定的意义。山西省大同市铁路职工家属窦少卿根据自己的切身体会，认为作好勤俭持家是培养孩子们勤俭朴素作风的一个有效方法。
    武汉市“五好”家庭妇女李春培，平常注意教育子女养成劳动的习惯。她的四个上学的孩子，品行都是五分或甲等，其中两个是“三好”学生。孩子们在家里都适当分工做一些家务劳动。
    在今天的会上，右派分子刘王立明、浦熙修作了一些交代。
    在今天大会上发言的有十二位代表，另有三十四位代表作了书面发言。
