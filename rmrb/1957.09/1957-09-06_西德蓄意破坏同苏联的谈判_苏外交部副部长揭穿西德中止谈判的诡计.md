Xinhua News Agency, September 4th, Moscow Dispatch: The head of the West German government delegation, Lahr, who was negotiating with the Soviet government delegation in Moscow, wrote a letter to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Semyonov on August 26th, using the pretext of disagreements on the so-called repatriation issue, suggesting a temporary suspension of the current negotiations between the two countries on trade and consular matters.

Semyonov is the head of the Soviet government delegation. In his reply to Lahr on September 3rd, he stated that the West German side's suggestion to suspend negotiations was, "in fact, an attempt to find an excuse to sabotage the negotiations between the two sides on trade and consular matters." He said, "Such measures can only be seen as an expression of the Federal Republic of Germany government's generally unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union."

When discussing the reasons for suggesting the suspension of negotiations in his letter, Lahr insisted that the Soviet Union had unilaterally removed the so-called repatriation issue from the negotiation agenda. However, Semyonov replied that the meetings held in Moscow by the two delegations had already given this issue sufficient time and attention, and that the repatriation issue had also been discussed during Lahr's visit to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and during more than one secret meeting between the heads of the two government delegations.

He said that during the negotiations, it had been fully confirmed the Soviet government's previously expressed opinion: the issue of repatriating German citizens from the Soviet Union no longer exists, and to continue discussing this issue would be completely pointless.

Semyonov said, "We have pointed out that we believe that failure to reach an agreement on one issue on the agenda should not be an obstacle to other issues." "The Soviet side is still willing to continue discussing the development of trade and consular relations between the two countries, and it believes that it is possible to reach an agreement on these issues."

Semyonov pointed out that Lahr's suggestion was, in fact, an attempt to find an excuse to sabotage the negotiations on trade and consular matters, which was inconsistent with his previous statement that the West German government was willing to improve relations with the Soviet Union. He said, "It is very clear that in this matter, the Federal Republic of Germany government should bear full responsibility for disrupting the negotiations and the consequences arising therefrom."

### 西德蓄意破坏同苏联的谈判  苏外交部副部长揭穿西德中止谈判的诡计

    西德蓄意破坏同苏联的谈判
    苏外交部副部长揭穿西德中止谈判的诡计
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在莫斯科同苏联政府代表团谈判的西德政府代表团团长拉尔8月26日写信给苏联外交部副部长谢苗诺夫，借口双方对所谓遣返问题有分歧，建议暂时中止两国现在正在进行的关于贸易和领事问题的谈判。
    谢苗诺夫是苏联政府代表团团长。他在9月3日复信给拉尔说，西德方面关于中止谈判的建议，“事实上是企图为破坏双方关于贸易和领事问题的谈判找寻借口”。他说：“这种措施只能被看成是德意志联邦共和国政府对苏联的总的不友好政策的表现。”
    拉尔在他的信中谈到建议中止谈判的理由的时候曾经硬说，苏联片面地从谈判日程上取消了所谓遣返问题。然而，谢苗诺夫回答他说，两国代表团在莫斯科举行的会议已经给予这个问题以足够的时间和注意，而且在拉尔访问苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的时候以及在两国政府代表团团长不止一次的秘密会见中也曾经讨论过有关遣返的问题。
    他说，在谈判过程中，已经完全证实了苏联政府先前所表示的意见：从苏联遣返德国公民的问题现在已经不存在了，要继续讨论这个问题就完全是无的放矢。
    谢苗诺夫说：“我们已经指出，我们认为，谈判没有就议程中的一个问题达成协议，这不会成为妨碍其他问题的障碍。”“苏联方面仍旧愿意继续讨论发展两国的贸易和领事关系的问题，它认为，要在这些问题上达成协议是有可能的。”
    谢苗诺夫指出，拉尔的建议事实上是企图为破坏关于贸易和领事问题的谈判寻找借口，这是同他从前所发表的所谓西德政府愿意改善同苏联的关系这种声明不相符合的。他说：“十分清楚，在这件事情上，德意志联邦共和国政府应当对破坏谈判和因此而产生的后果完全负责。”
