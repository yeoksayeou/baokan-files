Hanoi, September 1st (Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Nguyen Van Tran, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, met with reporters from our newspaper on the eve of the National Day to introduce the restoration and construction situation in Vietnam. He said: "The people's democratic system created by the great 'August Revolution' has opened up broad avenues for the development and prosperity of Vietnam's economy and culture." Nguyen Van Tran said that in the three years since the restoration of peace, the economy of Northern Vietnam has basically recovered to pre-war levels, and some economic sectors have even exceeded pre-war levels.

    Unprecedented Scale of New Industry
    Handicraft Industry Exceeds Pre-War Levels

Nguyen Van Tran first mentioned industry, saying: The industrial output value in 1956, the second year after the war, already accounted for 21% of the total output value of industry and agriculture, and it is expected to rise to 26% after the 1957 plan is completed. Although the output of modern industry has not yet caught up with the highest pre-war level of 1939, the industrial base has expanded by about one time compared to that time due to the construction and expansion of many industrial and mining enterprises. What is particularly important is that the industry in Northern Vietnam has fundamentally changed from serving the purpose of exploitation by imperialism in the past to developing the national economy and serving the interests of the Vietnamese people. Some new industries that did not exist in the past and were impossible to have have been established. For example, the Hanoi Machine Factory, which is about to start construction, will manufacture the first batch of machines in Vietnamese history. Some newly built light industries have begun to supply some daily necessities to the market and agricultural tools and fertilizers to the countryside. Handicraft industry, with the support and assistance of state-owned industries, has also achieved unprecedented development after peace. Both the number of production units, the number of employees, the variety of products, and the output have greatly exceeded the pre-war level, becoming an important assistant to modern industry.

    Transforming Grain Deficit into Surplus for Export
    Rural Areas Gradually Moving Towards Cooperativization

Speaking of agriculture, he said: Since peace, the development of agriculture in the North has been the most prominent. In 1956, the grain output in the North reached 4.13 million tons, exceeding the pre-war grain output of 1939 by 46%, thus creating a miracle: Northern Vietnam has always relied on the South to import grain, but now it can not only be self-sufficient but also have surplus grain for export. How did this phenomenon occur? The fundamental reason lies in the land reform that realized "land to the tillers," which liberated rural productive forces. In addition, with the strong support of the working class and the state to the farmers (such as providing loans, building water conservancy projects, and supplying agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers, etc.), agricultural production has still developed despite the severe threat of natural disasters, and four consecutive bumper harvests have been achieved. Now the average income of farmers is 303 kilograms of grain per year, and the historical phenomenon of spring famine has been basically eliminated. The purchasing power of rural areas has generally increased, providing an unusually broad market for industry. The rural areas in the North are gradually moving towards the road of cooperativization, and agricultural production will continue to increase.
    Newly Established Schools Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots
    Number of Students Three Times the Pre-War Level

Subsequently, talking about cultural and educational undertakings, Nguyen Van Tran said: In the past three years, the speed of development in this area has also been very rapid. Taking education as an example, more than 5,000 schools have been restored and newly built, with 950,000 students, three times the number of students before the war. More importantly, a new technical force serving the restoration and construction and economic development is gradually growing. This did not exist in the past and was impossible to have, because the purpose of the colonialists was to make Vietnam forever backward and forever under its control and exploitation. That era is now gone forever.

Nguyen Van Tran said: Vietnam's economy was originally very backward due to the constraints of feudalism for thousands of years and the cruel exploitation of imperialism for more than 80 years. In addition, the devastation of 15 years of continuous war made the conditions extremely difficult. However, thanks to the wise leadership of the Labor Party, the advantages of the people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance were brought into play, and the sincere and selfless cooperation and assistance of fraternal socialist countries, significant achievements were finally made in a short period of time. Naturally, due to lack of experience, some mistakes and shortcomings were made, and some difficulties were encountered, but those were just shortcomings and difficulties in the process of advancement. The Vietnamese people are full of confidence and will complete the restoration work in 1957 and enter a new stage of construction starting in 1958.

    “八月革命”的胜利开辟国家繁荣前途
    越南北方经济建设欣欣向荣
    ——越南国家计划委员会副主任对本报记者谈话——
    本报河内1日专电  越南民主共和国国家计划委员会副主任阮文珍，在国庆前夕接见本报记者，介绍越南恢复建设情况。他说：“伟大的‘八月革命’所创建的人民民主制度，为越南经济、文化的发展和繁荣开辟了广阔道路。”阮文珍说：在和平恢复后的三年时间里，越南北方经济已经基本上恢复到战前水平，其中有些经济部门并且超过了战前水平。
    新工业规模前所未有
    手工业超过战前水平
    阮文珍首先提到工业说：战后第二年——1956年的工业产值，已经占工农业总产值21％，预计1957年计划完成后，可以上升到26％。现代工业产量虽然还没有赶上战前1939年最高水平，但是由于新建和扩建了许多工矿企业，工业的基础要比那时扩大一倍左右。特别重要的是，越南北方的工业已经从过去为帝国主义榨取的目的服务，根本转变成为发展本国经济、为本国人民的利益服务。一些过去没有、也不可能有的新工业建立起来了，例如不久就要开工的河内机器厂，将要制造出越南有史以来的第一批机器。一些新建的轻工业，已经开始向市场供应若干日用品、向农村供应农具和肥料等。而手工业由于得到国营工业的支持和扶助，和平后也获得空前发展，不论是生产单位、就业人数、产品品种和产量都大大地超过了战前水平，成为现代工业重要的助手。
    变缺粮为有余粮出口
    农村逐步走向合作化
    接着谈到农业，他说：和平以来，北方农业的发展最为突出，1956年北方的谷物产量已经达到四百一十三万吨，超过战前1939年谷物产量46％，因此出现了一个奇迹：越南北方历来都要靠南方输入粮食，可是现在不仅可以自足，而且还有余粮出口。这种现象是怎样产生的？根本的原因就在于实现了“耕者有其田”的土地改革，解放了农村生产力。再加上农民得到工人阶级和国家的大力支援（例如发放贷款、兴修水利、供应农具和化学肥料等），因此虽然在重重的自然灾害的威胁下，农业生产仍然得到发展，并且连获四次丰收。现在农民每人每年平均收入三百零三公斤谷子，历史上遗留下来的春荒现象已经基本上消灭了。农村的购买力普遍地提高，为工业提供了一个异常广阔的市场。北方农村正逐步向合作化的道路前进，农业生产还将要不断地提高。新办学校如雨后春笋
    学生人数为战前三倍
    随后谈到文教事业，阮文珍说：三年来，这方面发展的速度也是很快的。仅以教育来说，恢复和新办的学校共五千多座，学生达到九十五万人，为战前学生数的三倍。更重要的是，一支为恢复建设、为发展经济服务的新的技术力量正在逐渐成长。这是过去所没有、也不可能有的，因为殖民者的目的是使越南永远落后、永远处在它的控制和压榨之下。这个时代现在已经一去不复返了。
    阮文珍说：越南由于受封建主义上千年的束缚以及帝国主义八十多年的残酷压榨，经济原来就十分落后，再加上十五年连续不断的战争的摧残，条件极其困难。但是由于劳动党的英明领导，由于发挥了以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度的优越性，由于社会主义阵营各兄弟国家真诚无私的合作与援助，终于在短短的时间里取得了显著成绩。自然也由于缺乏经验而犯了一些错误、缺点，遇到了一些困难，但那只是前进中的缺点和困难。越南人民满怀着信心，将要在1957年完成恢复工作，从1958年开始进入新的建设阶段。
