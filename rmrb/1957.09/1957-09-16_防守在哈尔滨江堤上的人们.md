More than one hundred thousand people defending the dikes along the Songhua River in Harbin have protected the city's safety through more than ten days of tenacious fighting. What follows are fragments of their heroic deeds.

The Red Shock Brigade

On the riverbank, there is a most active vanguard, consisting of thirty-six outstanding athletes from the Harbin Ice Training Class. At this critical juncture of flood prevention and rescue, each and every one of them bravely stepped forward. One of the girls, Xu Mingshu, was the 1956 national women's speed skating all-around champion. Each time she carried earth, it was always over eighty pounds, and once the earth was on her shoulder, she moved forward as fast as if she were on the ice rink. She always ran ahead of the young men. Communist Party member Sun Mengxiong, the vice-captain of the national ice hockey champion team, is also a hero who emerged during flood prevention. On August 31, the water level continued to rise sharply, and the waves crashed like slabs of gray stone. Several sections of the dike were already being eroded. Disregarding the cold, he was the first to jump into the water to block the breach, and everyone followed suit. They persisted in the water for an hour, connecting bundles of corn stalks into long circular dikes to resist the impact of the waves and protect the dike.

This vanguard has successfully rescued the dike five times and has been repeatedly praised by the flood control brigade, which calls them the "Red Shock Brigade." When the villagers in the suburbs see them, they clap their hands to welcome them from afar.

Hercules

On the Daowai riverbank, there was a man carrying earth with the number "28" printed on his white undershirt. He was heroic and burly. Who would believe that he was only a twenty-one-year-old young man! He carried over two hundred pounds of earth, walking quickly and with ease. This person, who attracted attention and praise everywhere, turned out to be Ye Laihong, who won the heavyweight championship at the National Fifteen Major Cities Boxing Championship held in Shanghai this April.

A Family of Father, Son, and Daughter-in-Law

On the dike, everyone is spreading a heartwarming story: a father, son, and daughter-in-law, all wearing the ribbons of honor.

The son, Wang Minxue, is the deputy director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Food Factory and a Communist Party member. He serves as the commander of the factory's large team in the flood prevention struggle. Workers say: Wherever the dike is most dangerous, wherever there are many difficulties, that's where our Director Wang is. Once, seepage was suddenly discovered on the dangerous dike on Qidao Street. Without hesitation, he took off his clothes and jumped into the cold river to investigate the danger. Seeing the director go into the water, the young workers on the dike also jumped in, and finally blocked the hole in time, protecting the dike.

Liang Guixin, the factory accountant, is Wang Minxue's wife. She is already the mother of three children. During last year's flood prevention, she was named a flood prevention model of the factory. This year, she entrusted her children to her mother-in-law to take care of and went to the dike with all the factory workers.

Wang Minxue's father, Wang Mingshan, is an old man in his sixties. On the second day of flood prevention in Harbin, he had just returned from the countryside. Seeing the flood raging, he immediately requested to participate in flood prevention, saying, "Family members also have the obligation to protect the factory and protect Harbin." People couldn't dissuade him, so they had to let him join in repairing the dike. In this way, he fought on the riverbank day and night for more than ten days.

Recently, the Food Factory has achieved excellent results in flood prevention and has been commended by the Daowai District Flood Prevention Headquarters. Wang Mingshan, his son, and his daughter-in-law were supported by the masses and wore the ribbons of honor.

Korean Women's Team

The Korean women's team has become a noteworthy force. For more than ten days, they have traveled all over the forty-mile-long dike in the city. This team started with only eleven people, but has now grown to forty-six. Each of them can carry more than one hundred pounds of earth. The fifty-six-year-old mother, Quan Shunai, lightly carries more than one hundred pounds of earth and even challenges the young daughters-in-law. On the afternoon of the 6th, they persevered for three hours in carrying earth in the pouring rain. Li Zhenshu, a family member of a worker at the Harbin Agricultural Tool Factory, ran more than thirty times in two hundred meters to carry earth, despite the rain and slippery conditions. After working this day, the women's faces were flushed and soaked with rain and sweat, but more than eighty tons of mud and earth were added to the flood control dike.

"Internists" of the Dike

The "internists" of the dike—the diving inspectors—are skilled at eliminating hidden dangers in the dike. They are naked, holding their breath, and constantly diving into the cold water, feeling with their hands and feet to find holes in the foot of the dike, immediately blocking them with stones to ensure the safety of the dike.

The diving inspection team of the Municipal Flood Prevention Headquarters is composed of four workers and staff members who are proficient in swimming. They are of different ages and professions, but they met while swimming in the Songhua River. The team leader, technician Feng Yongqing, and the team member, sugar factory worker Zhu Deyu, both participated in diving to inspect the dike last year and were named first-class flood prevention models. Fifty-three-year-old librarian Zhao Bingqiu and handicraft worker Miao Yongtian are famous "water monsters" on the Songhua River. Since August 29, the four of them have successively carried out tasks such as inspecting dikes, inspecting闸门 (sluice gates), and blocking sewer openings at dangerous dikes such as the Guxiang Dike and Machuankou. In the past ten days, each of them has dived into the river one or two hundred times. Although their bodies have been scratched in many places by thorns and barbed wire in the river, they are still determined to fight to eliminate all hidden dangers in the dike.

　　防守在哈尔滨江堤上的人们
　　新华社记者  陶肃琦  胡伟  王懋昌
    防守在哈尔滨市江堤上的十多万人，经过十多天的顽强战斗，保卫了市区的安全。这里记的是他们英雄事迹的片断。
    红色突击队
    在江堤上有一支最活跃的尖兵，他们是哈尔滨冰上训练班的三十六名出色运动员。在防洪抢险的艰巨关头，他们个个奋勇当先。队里有一个姑娘许明淑，是1956年全国女子速度滑冰全能冠军。她每次扛土总在八十斤以上，土一上肩就像在冰场上一样飞速前进。她总是跑在小伙子们前面。共产党员孙梦熊，这个全国冰球冠军队的副队长，也是防洪中涌现的英雄。8月31日那天，水位不断猛涨，浪涛像一片片灰色石板冲压过来，堤坝已有几处冲刷，他不顾寒冷，第一个跳进水去抢堵，大家也紧跟着跳下去。他们在水里坚持了一小时，用玉米秸捆连接成长圆形的护堤，阻挡了风浪的冲击，保住了堤坝。
    这支尖兵已成功地抢救了五次堤险，曾多次受到防汛大队的表扬，称他们为“红色突击队”。郊区老乡们见到他们，远远地就拍手欢迎。
    大力士
    道外江堤上一个扛土的男子，他的白背心上印着“28”号码。英勇魁梧，谁会信他才是二十一岁的小伙子！他扛二百多斤重的土，行走迅速，神态自如。这位到处受人注视和称赞的人，原来是今年4月在上海举行的全国十五大城市拳击锦标赛中获得重量级冠军的叶来洪。
    父子儿媳三人
    堤防上，人人传说着一段佳话：父子、儿媳带上光荣花。
    儿子王敏学是黑龙江省食品工厂的副厂长，共产党员，他在防汛斗争中担任工厂的大队指挥员。工人说：堤坝哪里最险要，哪里困难多，哪里就有我们的王厂长。有一次在七道街险堤突然发现了渗水，他毫不犹疑地脱下衣服，跳进寒冷的江水里查险。堤上的青年工人看见厂长下水，也随着跳下水去，终于及时堵住了洞口，保住了堤坝。
    工厂会计员梁桂馨是王敏学的爱人，她已是三个孩子的母亲了，在去年防汛中曾被评为工厂的防汛模范。今年她把孩子交给婆婆照顾，又照样和全厂职工一起走上堤防。
    王敏学的父亲王明山是年届花甲的老人。在哈尔滨防汛的第二天，他刚从农村回来，看到洪水逞凶，立刻要求参加防汛，他说：“家属也有义务保卫工厂，保卫哈尔滨。”人们劝他不住，只好让他参加修堤。这样他便十多昼夜始终不懈地战斗在江堤上。
    最近食品工厂在防汛中成绩优异，得到道外区防汛指挥部的嘉奖，王明山父子儿媳三人受群众拥护，戴上了光荣花。
    朝鲜族的妇女队
    朝鲜族的妇女队成为人们注目的一支队伍。十多天来，她们走遍了市区四十里长堤。这个队开始时只有十一人，现在已发展到四十六人。她们每人都能背起一百多斤土。五十六岁的老妈妈权顺爱轻快地挑起一百多斤土，还和年轻媳妇们挑战。6日下午，她们冒着滂沱大雨坚持了三小时的运土。哈尔滨农具厂工人家属李贞淑，不顾雨淋地滑，一小时在二百公尺的运土距离内跑了三十多次。这一天工作完后，在妇女队员们红润的脸上湿透了雨水和汗水，可是在防洪堤上却增加了八十多吨泥土。
    堤坝的“内科医生”
    堤坝的“内科医生”——潜水检查员，是消除堤坝隐患的能手。他们光着身子，屏住气，不时潜到寒冷的水里，手摸脚探，查出堤脚上的窟窿，立刻用石头堵住，保住堤坝的安全。
    市防汛指挥部的潜水检查组，是由四个深通水性的工人和职员组成的，他们年龄、职业不同，但是早在松花江游泳的时候就认识了。组长、技术员冯永清和组员、糖厂工人朱德裕，都曾经参加过去年潜水查堤工作，并且被评为一级防汛模范。五十三岁的图书管理员赵秉秋和手工业工人苗永田是松花江上有名的“水怪”。他们四个人从8月29日起，就先后在顾乡大堤、马船口等险要大堤进行查堤、查闸门和堵下水道口等工作。十多天来，他们每个人都潜到江水里一两百次。他们全身虽有好多处被江里的棘草、铁丝划破了，但他们仍然决心为消除堤坝的一切隐患而斗争。
