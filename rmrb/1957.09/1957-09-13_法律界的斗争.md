The current anti-rightist struggle in the national legal circles is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist lines in the construction of the national legal system, and a struggle between revolutionaries and reactionaries in legal thought.

Law and politics are inseparable. No matter how the rightist elements in the legal circles say that law is above politics, in this struggle, none of the issues they raised are purely legal issues. They spread reactionary old legal views, fabricated various slanders, and viciously attacked the socialist legal system. They are the vanguards and echoers of the Zhang-Luo alliance and the entire bourgeois right wing.

The conspiracy of the bourgeois rightist elements is to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and realize the restoration of the bourgeoisie, so the socialist legal system has become a major target of their attack. Because of this, this struggle in the legal circles has become particularly sharp and fierce.

I

To explain this frantic attack by the rightist elements in the legal circles, we must also go back to 1956. As everyone knows, 1956 was a year of great transformation in Chinese history. The socialist revolution has been basically completed in terms of the ownership of the means of production; the socialist system has been established in our country, but it has not yet been consolidated; in particular, the issue of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field has not yet been truly resolved. In this situation, the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the purpose of which is to resolve the issues of right and wrong in ideology and academia through free debate in intellectual circles, thereby strengthening the leading position of Marxism in the ideological field and more effectively promoting the prosperity and development of socialist culture and science in our country.

But what do some rightist elements, who hang the signboard of "jurists," think of such a policy? Proceeding from their own class consciousness, they thought that this was going to "change the sky." They said: "The proposal of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend has played a role in summoning souls for the legal circles. The old jurists were killed with one blow in the past, and the new jurists have been entangled in dogmatism in recent years and lost their souls. Therefore, they must be summoned back." What souls to summon? Obviously, that is to say, the new proletarian jurisprudence must be overthrown, and the old bourgeois jurisprudence must be revived. The fact is indeed the case. They have long slandered Marxism as "dogmatism," and attacked Marxism's theory of state and law in the name of anti-dogmatism.

We know that the most important part of Marxism is the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the touchstone for identifying revolution and counter-revolution, and the watershed between Marxists and all kinds of revisionists. For more than a hundred years, none of the bourgeois servant scholars and despicable traitors of the proletariat has not attacked Marxism on this issue, and none of them has not been battered and bruised by historical facts on this issue. But today, the rightist elements in the legal circles are actually following in the footsteps of these people and playing this trick that has long been exposed. For example, they said: "The theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is no longer correct in today's view." They distorted Lenin's definition of "dictatorship is a power that relies directly on force and is not restricted by any laws," and absurdly regarded the dictatorship of the proletariat as "terrorism" that does not need laws and excludes democracy. Everyone understands that once the dictatorship of the proletariat is established, it will successively create laws based on the needs of the struggle and the will of the people. But it is very obvious that the work of the proletariat in creating laws, when to create, how to create (what kind of laws to create, etc.) is of course "restricted" and determined by the dictatorship of the proletariat, rather than the dictatorship of the proletariat being "restricted" and determined by the laws of the proletariat. May I ask, if there is not first a victorious dictatorship of the proletariat, how is it possible to start creating proletarian laws? The more consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, the more complete the proletarian legal system can be. Isn't this a matter of course? Isn't bourgeois law a product of bourgeois dictatorship, but bourgeois dictatorship a product of bourgeois law? Haven't all the victorious revolutionary struggles in human history been the creators of the laws of each era, but rather the revolution is prescribed by law? In fact, these absurd statements by the rightist elements in the legal circles have nothing new, but are just a reproduction of the reactionary theories of the bourgeois servants that have long been negated by history, because Lenin's definition is aimed at such reactionary theories, and he clearly pointed out that this is a simple truth, as long as it is "not like the upper-class elements of the philistine bastards bought by the capitalists, such as the social imperialists of various countries," it is clear at a glance.

While viciously attacking the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the rightist elements in the legal circles also denied that the Marxist legal principles are the guiding ideology of our jurisprudence, deliberately listing it as one of the schools of jurisprudence, accusing it of "emphasizing the class stand too much and being narrow"; and openly proposed that the Marxist definition of law should be "changed" today, saying that law is not a tool of class dictatorship, but a "representation of the public will of the people." Everyone knows that the fundamental principle of Marxist jurisprudence is that it believes that law is only a representation of the will of the ruling class, and never a super-class "representation of the public will of the people." Since Marx revealed this truth to the world, jurisprudence has become a true science; and the bourgeois legal theory has since been completely declared bankrupt, exposing its thoroughly hypocritical and unscientific essence. As Lenin said, bourgeois jurisprudence does not explain the social roots of current laws, nor does it reveal the class interests protected by laws. It is only used to consolidate the prejudices in the minds of the philistines. In fact, the rightist elements' lie that law is a "representation of the public will of the people" has long been exposed by the Chinese people. For example, the "Constitution of the Republic of China" of the Kuomintang on the eve of its death was written at the beginning with "entrusted by all the people." May I ask, who among the Chinese people has ever believed such nonsense?

Since the actual situation is like this, why do the rightist elements still spread these bankrupt clichés everywhere? The question is very obvious. They are using the opportunity of the Party's proposal of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to steal the sky and change the day to tamper with Marxism, and to prepare a legal theoretical basis for those political careerists to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, restore the old legal system, and realize the restoration of the bourgeoisie.

Now it is not difficult for people to understand why, not long ago, some "jurists" were so keen on publicizing the "inheritability" of reactionary old laws everywhere, so actively advocating "attaching importance to" and "restoring" old jurisprudence, and even distorting the Marxist philosophical principles of the unity of opposites and the negation of negation, as well as the Party's correct policy towards the old culture, to defend the old laws that had long been abolished in many ways. Are these all purely for academic research and not for ulterior motives?

II

The rightist elements in the legal circles attacked the Party, estimating that this year was "the most critical year." The general slogan of their offensive was to "rule by law." They said, aren't you going to further expand the country's democratic life? Then, it is necessary to improve the "rule of law." What is "rule of law"? The rightist element Wang Zaoshi cited the example of the American police not arresting gambling as evidence, saying that the American police are so law-abiding that they know that people are gambling, but because they only see gambling tools and those gamblers are not sitting there gambling, they will not arrest people. They said that this is the "American serious spirit of rule of law" to be emulated. Obviously, such cunning "gamblers" that they are talking about exist here, and such a hypocritical "spirit of rule of law" certainly does not exist here.

Everyone knows that the bourgeois "rule of law" is only a guise for the bourgeois dictatorship. In order to cover up the essence of the dictatorship of the minority over the majority, the bourgeoisie can only say that the "rule of law" is super-class, super-political, and non-partisan, and is the highest embodiment of "national democracy," so as to blur the class consciousness of the working people and weaken the class struggle. This has long been exposed by Marxism; and it is understood by all progressive people. But some "jurists" wear such a pair of so-called "rule of law" colored glasses, collecting materials everywhere, looking for so-called errors and shortcomings in political and legal work, and creating various contradictions.

There is such an example: An agricultural cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, had a dispute and wanted to disband. The district party committee wanted the president of the district court to conduct political and ideological education. The president went to the community to understand the situation and spoke to the members who wanted to withdraw from the community, explaining the importance and benefits of the collectivization movement. As a result, the people who withdrew from the community admitted their mistakes and did not withdraw. At the conference held in the community, the president also spoke, promoting the articles of association of the community and the necessity of abiding by labor discipline. A dispute was completely resolved, and the masses also said that it is illegal not to abide by labor discipline, and we must work hard. Afterwards, the district court wrote a report to the municipal judicial bureau. However, the rightist element Lou Bangyan, this "jurist," had no goodwill for the court's doing such a good thing, but instead instructed on the report that cadres should "study the legal status of the court in this matter." As a result, a dispute was caused, and some people were even deceived by this instruction, thinking that the court violated the law and should not accept it without a complaint; the district committee violated the law, and the court personnel should not conduct political and ideological education. Some people even thought that it was wrong to say that it is illegal not to work. Later, some people deliberately distorted the facts in this blooming and contending, and put it forward as an important example of attacking the Party and the people's court. Of course, now everyone has seen clearly that this is the so-called "rule of law" concept of the rightist elements. This is a very good illustration: The rightist elements are so indifferent to the mass movement, so indifferent to the vital interests of the working people, so disdainful of the superiority of the people's judiciary, so opposed to the Party's leadership over judicial work, and so viciously setting fire with the slogan of "rule of law" to incite dissatisfaction with the Party.

Proceeding from this "rule of law" concept, the rightist elements in the legal circles fabricated various slanders to viciously attack "the Party issues orders," "replaces law with policies," and slanders "movement destroys the legal system." In short, it is said that "there is no rule of law, only rule by man." They said that "rule of law is inseparable from democracy, democracy is the principle, and it must be realized through the rule of law." Therefore, they proposed that everything should be legal and everything should be done according to law. What kind of democracy do they want? They openly said that they want "national democracy," and "counter-revolutionaries can still speak, write articles, and publish things after they are sentenced." What kind of rule of law do they want? That is naturally the "rule of law" that American police do not arrest gambling, so they think that people like Hu Feng are "ideological problems, not counter-revolutionaries."

Look! This is the so-called "rule of law" that the rightist elements in the legal circles openly proposed to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat! May I ask, is this kind of "rule of law" what the Chinese people want? The Chinese people are clear that the rule of law we want is the socialist rule of law of the proletariat, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest law. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no way to talk about the rule of law at all.

III

The rightist elements in the legal circles negated the achievements of legislative work, judicial work, and political and legal education in the past few years. On several major issues, based on their "rule of law" concept, they did their best to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong.

They clearly participated in many important legislative work in the past few years, but they said that "there is no law to follow." This kind of argument is not worth refuting. Because we now not only have a fundamental law, but also have promulgated more than 4,000 laws and regulations since the founding of the country to meet the needs of various aspects of national management. Although many of them are temporary and programmatic, this situation, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "In the period of revolutionary war and the early days of national liberation, in order to eliminate the remaining enemies, suppress the resistance of all counter-revolutionaries, destroy the reactionary order, and establish the revolutionary order, we can only stipulate some temporary and programmatic laws based on the policies of the Party and the people's government. During this period, the main task of the struggle was to liberate the people from the reactionary rule and liberate the social productive forces from the shackles of the old relations of production. The main method of the struggle was the direct action of the people. Therefore, those programmatic laws were suitable for the needs of the time." Of course, judging from the current situation, our legal system is not yet complete, but this cannot be said to be "there is no law to follow."

So, why did they propose "there is no law to follow"? According to the questions they raised, it is said that there is no criminal code or civil code. Indeed, we do not yet have these codes, but among the above-mentioned more than 4,000 laws and regulations, according to statistics, there are more than 280 separate laws and regulations of criminal law and civil law and laws and regulations with the nature of criminal law and civil law. As long as one recognizes the proletarian revolution, one should know that before the large-scale, storm-like mass class struggle has basically ended, and before the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically completed, it is not only very difficult to formulate a complete criminal code and civil code, but also absurd. The absurdity is no different from forcing an unborn fetus to wear clothes. In fact, we know that the question they raised is not fundamentally about whether there is a criminal code or a civil code. Otherwise, why did the rightist element Yang Zhaolong, who advocates the theory of no law, answer people by saying, "My opinion is not a matter of one article at a time, but a matter of the entire system" after the draft of the criminal law has already been made? Otherwise, why are some "jurists" not very interested in our drafting of socialist criminal law and civil law, but insist on formulating a "law on punishing false accusations" and a so-called "law on compensation for unjust imprisonment" as soon as possible? The question is very obvious. Their so-called "no law" means there is no law that meets their so-called "rule of law" of "giving democracy to counter-revolutionaries."

While clamoring that "there is no law to follow," they raised the "issue of the legislative work line." They desperately attacked the Party's consistent adherence to the policy of proceeding from reality, summarizing experience, gradually perfecting, and mass line in legal work. They described such a correct policy as "the root cause of slow legislation." The rightist elements Yang Yuqing, Yu Zhongluo, and others viciously portrayed it as "the self-intoxication of the Ah Q spirit." How can we quickly establish "law"? They said very clearly that we should oppose "legislative decentralism," and should extensively recruit "insiders," establish a so-called "Law Revision Hall," and want "Hu Hanmin" to be reborn; especially important is that the Party should "withdraw the past instructions on abolishing the Six Codes," saying that "the Party's criticism of the viewpoints of the Six Codes in the past should be corrected," and "as long as the two words 'the people' are added to the old Six Codes, they can still be used." This is the "legislative work line" that they proposed that is completely contrary to us. The reason why they unreasonably denigrate and oppose this fundamental work line of proceeding from reality is to further create ideological confusion among those old legal personnel who have not been well transformed, arrange for a "comeback," and prepare for the restoration of the old legal system.

The rightist elements in the legal circles always gnash their teeth when they mention the judicial reform movement carried out nationwide more than four years ago, saying that it was "a mess" and that it "created contradictions between Party and non-Party members in the legal circles." At the same time, they desperately denigrated the Party's leadership over judicial work, saying that "the presence of Communist Party members in judicial organs is in conflict with promoting democracy and implementing the people's democratic dictatorship"; they tried their best to uglify the current old workers and peasants, saying that they were "not as good as the old judicial personnel in the past," and wanted to "change the judicial cadre policy that used to prioritize politics." They roared and proposed to investigate the responsibility for judicial reform, and to "reform the judiciary again." How to reform again? That is to let the old legal personnel "come to power," "make a big change," and seize the "knife handle."

Was the judicial reform messed up? As everyone knows, judicial reform was a democratic reform movement launched after the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti" movement, targeting the serious impure phenomena existing in the judicial organs at that time in terms of politics, organization, and ideology. It was an indispensable mass political struggle and ideological struggle for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Its historical significance lies in the fact that it defended and implemented the Common Program and the judicial work line of the people's revolution throughout history. It purified the people's judicial organs at all levels, enabling many cadres to ideologically draw a clear line between the new and old legal principles, thereby laying the foundation for the further development of national legal system construction; it lies in the fact that it correctly implemented the Party's policy towards the old legal personnel. In addition to clearing out a very small number of bad elements, all of them were retained or re-arranged for work through training, learning, and various specific measures such as organizing participation in the exercise of actual struggle for a period of time, so that many people were ideologically transformed and became real people's legal workers. This is an indisputable fact. However, some "jurists" completely negated such an important historical experience in the construction of our national legal system, insisting that judicial reform "killed the old judicial personnel with one blow." So there was "summoning souls," "rescuing," "the legal circles are not contending but mourning," and "more importantly, to absorb nutrients from the dead," making it seem like ghosts were crying and howling.

Speaking of which, this is also a good thing. This educated us that the "knife handle" is important; this reminded us that the historical task of judicial reform has not been completely completed, and we must continue to struggle!

The rightist elements in the legal circles also released many poisonous arrows targeting political and legal education. The focus of the attack was the adjustment of political and legal departments that had been carried out in the past. They said that this was a "prominent manifestation of sectarianism" in legal education, "kicking away the old law professors and packing it with Party and League members."

Everyone understands that the rightist elements are spreading lies all over the sky. Taking the law departments of Beijing, Wuhan, Northwest, and Fudan universities as an example, according to statistics, among the existing lecturers and above, the so-called old law professors account for about 70%, Party member old cadres only account for 20%, and the rest are young teachers. Taking the four political and legal colleges in Beijing, East China, Central South, and Southwest as examples, according to statistics, the so-called old law professors also account for nearly half of the lecturers and above. May I ask, is this called "all the same"?

Everyone also understands that the education in old China, especially political and legal education, served the Kuomintang's reactionary ruling class, and a series of fundamental reforms must be carried out. At that time, the government's steps to adjust the political and legal departments were to first concentrate on running several political and legal colleges, actively transforming old teachers and cultivating new teachers, and then gradually re-establish the law departments of various universities. This is completely correct. Now some old law professors also say that it was completely necessary to temporarily not open classes and learn before teaching, which is really a good thing. However, some people describe this good thing as: "The old jurists were attacked and had no skin left, took money and did not open classes, and even their sons scolded them as rice buckets. This is such a painful accusation." May I ask, who are they accusing?

In order to overturn the adjustment of the political and legal departments in the past, the rightist elements tried their best to slander that the Party member old cadres "can only talk about Marxism-Leninism and are laymen in law," while the young cadres are "dogmatic, ten monks chanting the same scripture"; they desperately boasted that they were "authorities in law," negated legal education with Marxism as the guiding ideology, and nonsense that "legal science has regressed by twenty years." Therefore, they shouted loudly, "Red experts get out!" "Old law professors return to the team!" At the same time, they actively carried out the conspiracy of "re-adjusting" the political and legal departments. Now the facts have been revealed that in the capital's legal circles, the rightist group Qian Duansheng, Wang Tieya, Lou Bangyan, etc., had long been deliberately making various arrangements for "returning to the team" in order to realize the so-called "large law school," "large international relations department," and "large law research institute" program that did not want the leadership of the Party committee or the leadership of the business department. Because they fully understood the important significance of occupying the political and legal education position.

IV

From all the above, it can be clearly seen that the attack of the rightist elements in the legal circles on the national legal system is theoretically prepared, and has a program, a plan, and a line. Now their reactionary conspiracy has been exposed. In the face of truth, they have to admit that they have made mistakes. However, many of them take the posture of "lawyers" appearing in court, and adopt the so-called "four-sided exchange, opening the door back and forth" to make "self-criticism," saying that what he "originally said does not represent his thoughts," and that the mistake was accidental. In fact, people are very clear that they have never fundamentally and are unwilling to change their bourgeois world outlook for a long time. As they said, their means of production are the theoretical viewpoints of old jurisprudence, so they cannot be transformed. Therefore, as long as there is an opportunity, they will use their own viewpoints to transform our political and legal system. What's more, some of them have long been anti-Communist and anti-people "heroes," and have long had other intentions. Therefore, this is by no means an accidental thing. Now, the question lies here. Where do they go from here? First of all, it depends on whether they truly recognize this point.

The struggle has educated the people and every legal work cadre that the bourgeoisie will not be willing to withdraw from the stage of history after being deprived of its economic base, and the reactionary old legal viewpoints are the ideological weapons used by political careerists to attempt to restore. Therefore, the struggle to thoroughly eliminate the old legal viewpoints is still an arduous task for our legal circles.

The struggle is deepening and unfolding. This is a great debate in the legal circles, a decisive struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the legal superstructure. Without winning this struggle, it is impossible to further strengthen and consolidate the socialist legal system. Our task is to improve ourselves, improve our work, and solve a series of fundamental problems in our legal system construction and legal science through this debate and struggle, so that our various legal work can better serve the country's socialist construction.

### 法律界的斗争

　　法律界的斗争
　　陶希晋
    目前全国法律界正在进行的反右派的斗争，是国家法制建设上社会主义与资本主义间的两条路线的斗争，是法律思想上革命派与反动派的斗争。
    法律和政治是分不开的。不管法律界右派分子们怎样说法律是超政治的，但是在这次斗争中，他们提出的问题，没有一个是纯法律的问题。他们散布反动的旧法观点，制造各种谰言，恶毒地攻击社会主义法制。他们是章罗联盟和整个资产阶级右派的急先锋和应声虫。
    资产阶级右派分子的阴谋，就是要取消无产阶级专政，实现资产阶级复辟，所以社会主义法制就成为他们主要攻击的一个目标。正因为这样，法律界的这次斗争，也就表现得特别尖锐，特别激烈。
　　一
    要说明法律界右派分子的这次疯狂的进攻，我们还必须回溯到1956年去。大家知道，1956年是我国历史上伟大的转变的一年。社会主义革命在生产资料所有制方面已经基本完成；社会主义制度在我们国家里已经建立起来，但是它还没有巩固；特别是无产阶级与资产阶级在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的问题，还没有得到真正解决。在这种情况下，党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，其目的就是要通过知识界的自由争论，来解决思想上、学术上的是非问题，从而加强马克思主义在思想界的领导地位，更有效地促进我国社会主义文化和科学的繁荣与发展。
    可是有些挂着“法学家”招牌的右派分子，对这样一个方针是怎么样的看法呢？他们从自己的阶级意识出发，以为这是要“变天”了。他们说：“百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针的提出，对法律界来说，是起了招魂的作用，旧法学家过去被一棍子打死了，新法学家几年来被教条主义缠住，失了魂。因而都要把它招回来”。招什么魂？极明显，那就是说，无产阶级新法学要推翻，而资产阶级旧法学要复活。事实也确是如此。他们早就污蔑马克思主义为“教条主义”，以反教条主义为名，攻击马克思主义关于国家和法律的学说。
    我们知道，马克思主义的最重要部分，就是无产阶级专政的理论。这是识别革命与反革命的试金石，是马克思主义者与形形色色的修正主义之间的分水岭。百年多来，一些资产阶级的仆从学者和无产阶级的卑鄙叛徒，没有一个不是从这一问题上来进攻马克思主义，也没有一个不是在这个问题上被历史事实碰得头破血流。可是今天法律界的右派分子，居然又步着这些人的后尘，来耍这一套早经拆穿了的惯技。例如他们说：“无产阶级专政的理论，在今天看来已不正确了”，他们歪曲列宁关于“专政是直接凭借于强力而不受任何法律限制的政权”的定义，荒谬地把无产阶级专政说成为不要法律的排斥民主的“恐怖主义”。谁也懂得，无产阶级专政一经确立以后，就依据斗争需要和人民意志陆续地创制法律来办事。但是十分明显，无产阶级创制法律的工作，在什么时候创制，怎样创制，（创制什么样的法律等等）当然受无产阶级专政所“限制”、所决定，而不是无产阶级专政受无产阶级的法律所“限制”、所决定。试问，如果不首先有胜利的无产阶级专政，怎么有可能着手创制无产阶级的法律呢？无产阶级专政愈巩固，无产阶级的法制才能愈完备，这难道还不是天经地义的吗？难道资产阶级的法律不是资产阶级专政的产物，反而资产阶级专政是资产阶级法律的产物吗？难道人类历史上的一切胜利的革命斗争不是各个时代的法律的创造者，反而革命是法律规定出来的吗？其实，法律界右派分子的这些荒谬说法，并没有什么新奇的东西，只不过是早被历史否定了的资产阶级仆从们的反动理论的翻版而已，因为列宁这个定义，正是针对着这样反动理论说的，而且他明确的指出，这是一个简单的真理，只要“不是如像各国的社会帝国主义者这班资本家收买的市侩混蛋的上层分子”，都是一目了然的。
    法律界右派分子在恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政理论的同时，也就否认马克思主义的法学原理是我们法学的指导思想，故意把它列为法学流派之一，指责它“太强调阶级立场而有狭隘性”；并且公开提出马克思主义关于法律的定义，今天要“改一改”了，说法律不是阶级专政的工具，而是什么“国民公共意志的表现”。谁都知道，马克思主义法学的根本原理，就是它认为法律只不过是统治阶级意志的表现，决不是什么超阶级的“国民公共意志的表现”。世界上自从马克思揭明了这一真理以后，法学才成为真正的科学；而资产阶级的法学理论，也就从此整个地宣告破产，暴露了它彻头彻尾虚伪的反科学的实质。正如列宁所说，资产阶级的法学，不解释现行法律的社会根源，不揭开法律所保护的那些阶级利益，它只不过是用以巩固庸人头脑中的偏见而已。实际上右派分子所谓法律是“国民公共意志的表现”的谎言，也早已被中国人民戳穿了。比如国民党在死亡前夕的“中华民国宪法”上，开头就写着“受全体国民之付托”，试问，中国人民有谁曾经相信过这种鬼话呢？
    实际情况既然如此，那么右派分子为什么还到处散布这些早就破产了的陈词滥调呢？问题很明显，他们是在利用党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一方针的时机，来偷天换日地篡改马克思主义，为那些政治野心家推翻无产阶级专政、恢复旧法统、实现资产阶级复辟，准备法律理论的根据。
    现在人们已经不难了解，为什么不久以前，有些“法学家”们那样热衷于到处宣扬反动旧法的“可继承”，那样积极提倡“重视”、“恢复”旧法学，甚至不惜歪曲马克思主义关于矛盾的统一和否定之否定的哲学原理，以及党对待旧文化的正确方针，来为早经废除了的旧法多方辩护。难道这都是单纯地为了学术的研究而不是别有用心吗？
　　二
   法律界右派分子向党进攻，曾估计今年是“最关键的一年”。他们发动进攻的总口号是要“法治”，他们说，你们不是要进一步扩大国家的民主生活吗？那末，就必须健全“法治”。什么叫“法治”呢？右派分子王造时举出了美国警察不抓赌为例证，说，美国的警察是那样的守法，明知人赌博，但因为仅见赌具而那些赌客并没有正坐在那里赌，所以就不抓人。他们说这就是要效法的“美国的认真的法治精神”。显然，他们说的这样一种诡诈的“赌客”，在我们这里是有的，而那样一种虚伪的“法治精神”，的确在我们这里是没有的。
    谁都知道，资产阶级的“法治”，只不过是资产阶级专政的幌子。资产阶级为要掩盖少数人对多数人专政的本质，只能把“法治”说成是超阶级、超政治、超党派的，是“全民民主”的最高体现，借以模糊劳动人民的阶级意识，削弱阶级斗争。这是马克思主义早已戳穿了的；并且是所有进步的人们都懂得的。可是有些“法学家”就戴着这样一副所谓“法治”的有色眼镜，到处搜集材料，找政法工作中的所谓错误缺点，制造各种矛盾。
    有这样一个事例：北京丰台区有一个农业合作社闹纠纷，要散伙，区的党委要该区法院院长去进行政治思想教育工作。院长去该社了解了情况，对要求退社的社员比生活讲道理，说明合作化运动的重要和好处。结果退社的人承认了错误，不退社了。在社召开的大会上，院长也讲了话，宣传了社章和遵守劳动纪律的必要。一场纠纷完全解决了，群众并且说，不遵守劳动纪律是犯法，我们要很好劳动。事后区法院向市司法局写了一个报告。可是右派分子楼邦彦这位“法学家”，对法院办了这样的一件好事，毫无好感，反而在报告上批示，要干部们“研究法院在这件事上的法律地位”。结果引起一场争论，居然也就有人被这批示迷惑，认为：法院违法，没有告状不应受理；区委违法，法院人员不应去作政治思想教育工作。甚至有人认为谁说不劳动就是违法这句话也是不对的。这件事情，后来居然也就有人在这次鸣放中故意歪曲事实，作为向党和人民法院进攻的重要例证提出。当然，现在大家已经看清，这就是右派分子的所谓“法治”观念。这正是极好说明：右派分子就是那样不关心群众运动、不关心劳动人民的切身利益，就是那样蔑视人民司法的优越性，就是那样反对党对司法工作的领导，就是那样用“法治”这个口号来恶毒地点火，煽动对党的不满。
    法律界右派分子也就是从这种“法治”观念出发，制造各种谰言，来恶毒地攻击“党发号施令”，“以政策代替法律”，污蔑“运动破坏法制”。总之是说“没有法治，只有人治”。他们说“法治与民主分不开，民主是原则，必须通过法治才能实现”。所以他们提出，一切要法定，一切要依法。要什么民主？他们公开讲，要“全民民主”，要“反革命分子判决了还可以讲话、写文章、出版东西”的民主。要什么法治？那自然就是要美国警察见赌不抓的“法治”，所以像胡风这样的“赌客”，他们就认为：“是思想问题，而不是反革命分子”了。
    请看！这就是法律界右派分子公然提出的要代替无产阶级专政的所谓“法治”！试问这种“法治”，难道是中国人民所要的吗？中国人民都清楚，我们所要的法治，是无产阶级的社会主义法治，而无产阶级专政就是最高的法律，离开了无产阶级专政，就根本谈不到什么法治。

    法律界右派分子否定过去几年来立法工作、司法工作和政法教育的成绩，在几个主要问题上，根据他们的“法治”观念，更竭尽了颠倒黑白、混淆是非之能事。
    他们明明亲自参与了过去几年来许多重要的立法工作，而却说“无法可循”。这种论调，本来是不值得一驳的。因为我们现在不仅有了根本法，而且建国以来，适应国家管理各个方面的需要，颁布了四千多件法规。虽然其中许多是临时的纲领性的，但是这种情况，正如刘少奇同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中所指出的：“在革命战争时期和全国解放初期，为了肃清残余的敌人，镇压一切反革命分子的反抗，破坏反动的秩序，建立革命的秩序，只能根据党和人民政府的政策，规定一些临时的纲领性的法律。在这个时期，斗争的主要任务是从反动统治下解放人民，从旧的生产关系的束缚下解放社会生产力，斗争的主要方法是人民群众的直接行动。因此，那些纲领性的法律是适合于当时的需要的。”当然，从目前情况来看，我们的法制还不够完备，但这总不能说是“无法可循”吧。
    那末，他们为什么提出“无法可循”呢？据他们提出的问题，是说没有刑法典、民法典。的确，我们还没有这些法典，但是，在上述四千多件法规中，据统计刑法、民法的单行法规和带有刑法、民法性质的法规，即有二百八十余件之多。只要承认无产阶级革命，就应该知道，在大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争没有基本结束以前，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造没有基本完成以前，制定完备的刑法典、民法典不但是很困难的，而且是荒谬的，其荒谬无异于强迫还没有出世的胎儿穿衣服。其实，我们知道，他们提出的问题，根本还不在于有无刑法典、民法典，否则，为什么现在刑法已经有了草案之后，高唱无法论的右派分子杨兆龙又回答人家说，“我的意见不是一点一条的问题，而是整个体系的问题”呢？否则，又为什么还有些“法学家”对我们起草社会主义的刑法、民法，兴趣并不高，而非要从速制定什么“惩治诬陷法”和所谓“冤狱赔偿法”不可呢？问题很明显，他们所谓“无法”，就是没有符合他们所谓“法治”的“对反革命也给民主”的法。
    在叫嚣“无法可循”的同时，他们提出了
  “立法工作路线问题”。他们拚命攻击我们党在法制工作中一向坚持的从实际出发、总结经验、逐步完备和群众路线的方针。他们把这样的正确方针，说成为“立法迟缓的根源”。右派分子杨玉清、俞钟骆等更恶毒地描绘成为“阿Q精神自我陶醉”。怎样才能迅速立出“法”来呢？他们说得非常清楚，要反对“立法的分散主义”，应该广揽“内行”，成立所谓“法律修订馆”，要“胡汉民”再生；特别重要的是：要党“收回过去关于废除六法全书的指示”，说“党在过去对六法观点的批判应当纠正”，“旧六法条文只要加上人民两字，一样可用”。这就是他们提出的同我们完全背道而驰的“立法工作路线”。他们所以蛮无道理地诋毁和反对从实际出发的这一根本工作路线，其目的也就是企图借此进一步造成那些未经很好改造的旧法人员的思想混乱，安排“东山再起”，准备旧法统的复辟。
    法律界右派分子，一提起四年多以前在全国范围内进行的司法改革运动，总是咬牙切齿，把它说成“一团糟”，认为它“制造了法律界党与非党之间的矛盾”。与此同时，拼命诋毁党对司法工作的领导，说什么“司法机关中有共产党员，是与发扬民主、贯彻人民民主专政相抵触的”；竭力丑化现在的工农老干部“不如往日的旧司法人员”，要“改变过去以政治为首要条件的司法干部政策”。他们咆哮如雷地提出要追究搞司法改革的责任，要“司法再改革”。怎样再改革？那就是要旧法人员“上台”，“大换班”，抓“刀把子”。
    司法改革是不是搞糟了呢？大家知道，司法改革是那时紧接着“三反、五反”后，针对着当时司法机关在政治上、组织上、思想上存在着严重不纯的现象，而进行的一次民主改革运动，它是巩固人民民主专政不可缺少的一次群众性的政治斗争和思想斗争。它的历史意义，就在于它捍卫与贯彻执行了共同纲领和人民革命历来的司法工作路线，它纯洁了各级人民司法机关，使许多干部在思想上划清了新旧法律的原则界限，从而为国家法制建设进一步的开展奠定了基础；就在于它正确执行了党对旧法人员的政策，除了清除极少数的坏分子外，都是继续留用或者通过调训学习、重新安排工作，以及组织参加一时期实际斗争的锻炼等各种具体措施，使许多人获得了思想改造，成为真正的人民的法律工作者。这是无可争辩的事实。可是有些“法学家”，竟会把我们国家法制建设上的这样一个重要的历史经验，完全否定，硬说司法改革“把旧司法人员一棍子打死了”，于是“招魂”呀，“抢救”呀，“法律界不是争鸣而是哀鸣”，“更重要的是要从打死的人那里吸取营养”呀，闹得真像在鬼哭神嚎。
    说来，这倒亦是好事。这教育了我们，“刀把子”是重要的；这提醒了我们，司法改革的历史任务还没有彻底完成，我们还须继续斗争！
    法律界右派分子针对着政法教育方面，也放出了许多毒箭，集中攻击点是过去进行的政法院系调整。他们说这是法律教育上的“突出的宗派主义表现”，“把老法学教师一脚踢开了，清一色的党团员包下来了”。
    谁都明白右派分子是在漫天撒谎。就拿北京、武汉、西北和复旦四个大学的法律系来说，据统计在现有讲师以上的人员中，所谓老法学教师即约占70％，党员老干部仅占20％，余为青年教师。再以北京、华东、中南和西南四个政法学院来说，统计所谓老法学教师，亦占讲师以上人员的将近半数。试问这叫做“清一色”吗？
    谁都也明白，旧中国的教育，尤其政治法律教育，是为国民党反动统治阶级服务的，必须进行一系列的根本性的改革。当时对政法院系的调整，政府采取的步骤，是先集中办几个政法院校，一面积极改造旧教师，一面培养新师资，而后逐步重新建立各大学法律系。这是完全正确的。现在有些老法学教师也说，那时暂不开课，学而后教，是完全必要的，真是好事。可是有人却把这好事形容成：“旧法学家被攻击得体无完肤，拿钱不开课，连儿子也骂饭桶，这是多么沉痛的控诉”。试问这是在向谁控诉呢？
    法律界右派分子为了对过去政法院系的调整进行翻案，他们竭力污蔑说党员老干部“只会讲马列主义，对法学是外行”，而青年干部又是“教条主义，十个和尚念一本经”；他们拚命吹嘘自己是什么“法学权威”，否定以马克思主义为指导思想的法律教育，胡说什么“法律科学倒退了二十年”。因此，他们就大声疾呼，“红色专家滚出去”！“老法学教师归队”！同时，就积极地进行了政法院系“再调整”的阴谋活动。现在事实已经揭露，在首都法律界，右派集团钱端升、王铁崖、楼邦彦等即早已处心积虑地为实现不要党委领导、亦不要业务部门领导的所谓“大法学院”、“大国际关系系”和“大法学研究所”的方案，而作了“归队”的各种安排。因为他们完全懂得占领政法教育阵地的重要意义。
    四
    从上述一切，可以清楚地看出，法律界右派分子向国家法制的进攻，是有理论准备的，是有纲领、有计划和有路线的。现在他们的反动阴谋已经被揭露，在真理面前，他们不得不承认犯了错误。可是他们不少是以“律师”出庭的姿态，采取所谓“四面交流、前后开门”的手法来作“检讨”，说他“原来讲话不代表思想”，错误是偶然的。其实人们很清楚，他们长期以来，根本没有也不愿意改变自己的资产阶级世界观。确如他们所说，他们的生产资料就是旧法学的理论观点，因而是改造不得的。所以，只要一有机会，他们就要以自己的观点来改造我们的政治法律制度。何况其中还有些人，老早就是反共、反人民的“英雄”，老早就是别有企图的。因此，这决不是偶然的事情。现在，问题就在这里，他们何去何从，首先就看他们是否真正认识到这一点。
    斗争教育了人们和我们每个法律工作干部，资产阶级被剥夺了经济基础后，是不会甘心退出历史舞台的，而反动的旧法观点，又是政治野心家们利用来企图复辟的思想武器。所以，彻底肃清旧法观点的斗争，仍然是我们法律界一项艰巨的任务。
      斗争正在深入展开着。这是法律界的一场大辩论，是无产阶级与资产阶级在法律上层建筑方面的一场决定胜负的斗争。不取得这场斗争的胜利，社会主义法制的进一步加强和巩固是不可能
  的。我们的任务还在于要通过这场辩论和斗争，提高自己，改进工作，解决我们法制建设上和法律科学上一系列的根本问题，从而使我们的各项法律工作更好地为国家的社会主义建设服务。
