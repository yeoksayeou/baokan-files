The current anti-rightist struggle in the national legal circles is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist lines in the construction of the national legal system, and a struggle between revolutionaries and reactionaries in legal thought.

Law and politics are inseparable. No matter how the rightist elements in the legal circles say that law is above politics, in this struggle, none of the issues they raised are purely legal issues. They spread reactionary old legal views, fabricated various slanders, and viciously attacked the socialist legal system. They are the vanguards and echoers of the Zhang-Luo alliance and the entire bourgeois right wing.

The conspiracy of the bourgeois rightist elements is to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and realize the restoration of the bourgeoisie, so the socialist legal system has become a major target of their attack. Because of this, this struggle in the legal circles has become particularly sharp and fierce.

I

To explain this frantic attack by the rightist elements in the legal circles, we must also go back to 1956. As everyone knows, 1956 was a year of great transformation in Chinese history. The socialist revolution has been basically completed in terms of the ownership of the means of production; the socialist system has been established in our country, but it has not yet been consolidated; in particular, the issue of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field has not yet been truly resolved. In this situation, the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the purpose of which is to resolve the issues of right and wrong in ideology and academia through free debate in intellectual circles, thereby strengthening the leading position of Marxism in the ideological field and more effectively promoting the prosperity and development of socialist culture and science in our country.

But what do some rightist elements, who hang the signboard of "jurists," think of such a policy? Proceeding from their own class consciousness, they thought that this was going to "change the sky." They said: "The proposal of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend has played a role in summoning souls for the legal circles. The old jurists were killed with one blow in the past, and the new jurists have been entangled in dogmatism in recent years and lost their souls. Therefore, they must be summoned back." What souls to summon? Obviously, that is to say, the new proletarian jurisprudence must be overthrown, and the old bourgeois jurisprudence must be revived. The fact is indeed the case. They have long slandered Marxism as "dogmatism," and attacked Marxism's theory of state and law in the name of anti-dogmatism.

We know that the most important part of Marxism is the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the touchstone for identifying revolution and counter-revolution, and the watershed between Marxists and all kinds of revisionists. For more than a hundred years, none of the bourgeois servant scholars and despicable traitors of the proletariat has not attacked Marxism on this issue, and none of them has not been battered and bruised by historical facts on this issue. But today, the rightist elements in the legal circles are actually following in the footsteps of these people and playing this trick that has long been exposed. For example, they said: "The theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is no longer correct in today's view." They distorted Lenin's definition of "dictatorship is a power that relies directly on force and is not restricted by any laws," and absurdly regarded the dictatorship of the proletariat as "terrorism" that does not need laws and excludes democracy. Everyone understands that once the dictatorship of the proletariat is established, it will successively create laws based on the needs of the struggle and the will of the people. But it is very obvious that the work of the proletariat in creating laws, when to create, how to create (what kind of laws to create, etc.) is of course "restricted" and determined by the dictatorship of the proletariat, rather than the dictatorship of the proletariat being "restricted" and determined by the laws of the proletariat. May I ask, if there is not first a victorious dictatorship of the proletariat, how is it possible to start creating proletarian laws? The more consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, the more complete the proletarian legal system can be. Isn't this a matter of course? Isn't bourgeois law a product of bourgeois dictatorship, but bourgeois dictatorship a product of bourgeois law? Haven't all the victorious revolutionary struggles in human history been the creators of the laws of each era, but rather the revolution is prescribed by law? In fact, these absurd statements by the rightist elements in the legal circles have nothing new, but are just a reproduction of the reactionary theories of the bourgeois servants that have long been negated by history, because Lenin's definition is aimed at such reactionary theories, and he clearly pointed out that this is a simple truth, as long as it is "not like the upper-class elements of the philistine bastards bought by the capitalists, such as the social imperialists of various countries," it is clear at a glance.

While viciously attacking the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the rightist elements in the legal circles also denied that the Marxist legal principles are the guiding ideology of our jurisprudence, deliberately listing it as one of the schools of jurisprudence, accusing it of "emphasizing the class stand too much and being narrow"; and openly proposed that the Marxist definition of law should be "changed" today, saying that law is not a tool of class dictatorship, but a "representation of the public will of the people." Everyone knows that the fundamental principle of Marxist jurisprudence is that it believes that law is only a representation of the will of the ruling class, and never a super-class "representation of the public will of the people." Since Marx revealed this truth to the world, jurisprudence has become a true science; and the bourgeois legal theory has since been completely declared bankrupt, exposing its thoroughly hypocritical and unscientific essence. As Lenin said, bourgeois jurisprudence does not explain the social roots of current laws, nor does it reveal the class interests protected by laws. It is only used to consolidate the prejudices in the minds of the philistines. In fact, the rightist elements' lie that law is a "representation of the public will of the people" has long been exposed by the Chinese people. For example, the "Constitution of the Republic of China" of the Kuomintang on the eve of its death was written at the beginning with "entrusted by all the people." May I ask, who among the Chinese people has ever believed such nonsense?

Since the actual situation is like this, why do the rightist elements still spread these bankrupt clich√©s everywhere? The question is very obvious. They are using the opportunity of the Party's proposal of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to steal the sky and change the day to tamper with Marxism, and to prepare a legal theoretical basis for those political careerists to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, restore the old legal system, and realize the restoration of the bourgeoisie.

Now it is not difficult for people to understand why, not long ago, some "jurists" were so keen on publicizing the "inheritability" of reactionary old laws everywhere, so actively advocating "attaching importance to" and "restoring" old jurisprudence, and even distorting the Marxist philosophical principles of the unity of opposites and the negation of negation, as well as the Party's correct policy towards the old culture, to defend the old laws that had long been abolished in many ways. Are these all purely for academic research and not for ulterior motives?

II

The rightist elements in the legal circles attacked the Party, estimating that this year was "the most critical year." The general slogan of their offensive was to "rule by law." They said, aren't you going to further expand the country's democratic life? Then, it is necessary to improve the "rule of law." What is "rule of law"? The rightist element Wang Zaoshi cited the example of the American police not arresting gambling as evidence, saying that the American police are so law-abiding that they know that people are gambling, but because they only see gambling tools and those gamblers are not sitting there gambling, they will not arrest people. They said that this is the "American serious spirit of rule of law" to be emulated. Obviously, such cunning "gamblers" that they are talking about exist here, and such a hypocritical "spirit of rule of law" certainly does not exist here.

Everyone knows that the bourgeois "rule of law" is only a guise for the bourgeois dictatorship. In order to cover up the essence of the dictatorship of the minority over the majority, the bourgeoisie can only say that the "rule of law" is super-class, super-political, and non-partisan, and is the highest embodiment of "national democracy," so as to blur the class consciousness of the working people and weaken the class struggle. This has long been exposed by Marxism; and it is understood by all progressive people. But some "jurists" wear such a pair of so-called "rule of law" colored glasses, collecting materials everywhere, looking for so-called errors and shortcomings in political and legal work, and creating various contradictions.

There is such an example: An agricultural cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, had a dispute and wanted to disband. The district party committee wanted the president of the district court to conduct political and ideological education. The president went to the community to understand the situation and spoke to the members who wanted to withdraw from the community, explaining the importance and benefits of the collectivization movement. As a result, the people who withdrew from the community admitted their mistakes and did not withdraw. At the conference held in the community, the president also spoke, promoting the articles of association of the community and the necessity of abiding by labor discipline. A dispute was completely resolved, and the masses also said that it is illegal not to abide by labor discipline, and we must work hard. Afterwards, the district court wrote a report to the municipal judicial bureau. However, the rightist element Lou Bangyan, this "jurist," had no goodwill for the court's doing such a good thing, but instead instructed on the report that cadres should "study the legal status of the court in this matter." As a result, a dispute was caused, and some people were even deceived by this instruction, thinking that the court violated the law and should not accept it without a complaint; the district committee violated the law, and the court personnel should not conduct political and ideological education. Some people even thought that it was wrong to say that it is illegal not to work. Later, some people deliberately distorted the facts in this blooming and contending, and put it forward as an important example of attacking the Party and the people's court. Of course, now everyone has seen clearly that this is the so-called "rule of law" concept of the rightist elements. This is a very good illustration: The rightist elements are so indifferent to the mass movement, so indifferent to the vital interests of the working people, so disdainful of the superiority of the people's judiciary, so opposed to the Party's leadership over judicial work, and so viciously setting fire with the slogan of "rule of law" to incite dissatisfaction with the Party.

Proceeding from this "rule of law" concept, the rightist elements in the legal circles fabricated various slanders to viciously attack "the Party issues orders," "replaces law with policies," and slanders "movement destroys the legal system." In short, it is said that "there is no rule of law, only rule by man." They said that "rule of law is inseparable from democracy, democracy is the principle, and it must be realized through the rule of law." Therefore, they proposed that everything should be legal and everything should be done according to law. What kind of democracy do they want? They openly said that they want "national democracy," and "counter-revolutionaries can still speak, write articles, and publish things after they are sentenced." What kind of rule of law do they want? That is naturally the "rule of law" that American police do not arrest gambling, so they think that people like Hu Feng are "ideological problems, not counter-revolutionaries."

Look! This is the so-called "rule of law" that the rightist elements in the legal circles openly proposed to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat! May I ask, is this kind of "rule of law" what the Chinese people want? The Chinese people are clear that the rule of law we want is the socialist rule of law of the proletariat, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest law. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no way to talk about the rule of law at all.

III

The rightist elements in the legal circles negated the achievements of legislative work, judicial work, and political and legal education in the past few years. On several major issues, based on their "rule of law" concept, they did their best to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong.

They clearly participated in many important legislative work in the past few years, but they said that "there is no law to follow." This kind of argument is not worth refuting. Because we now not only have a fundamental law, but also have promulgated more than 4,000 laws and regulations since the founding of the country to meet the needs of various aspects of national management. Although many of them are temporary and programmatic, this situation, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "In the period of revolutionary war and the early days of national liberation, in order to eliminate the remaining enemies, suppress the resistance of all counter-revolutionaries, destroy the reactionary order, and establish the revolutionary order, we can only stipulate some temporary and programmatic laws based on the policies of the Party and the people's government. During this period, the main task of the struggle was to liberate the people from the reactionary rule and liberate the social productive forces from the shackles of the old relations of production. The main method of the struggle was the direct action of the people. Therefore, those programmatic laws were suitable for the needs of the time." Of course, judging from the current situation, our legal system is not yet complete, but this cannot be said to be "there is no law to follow."

So, why did they propose "there is no law to follow"? According to the questions they raised, it is said that there is no criminal code or civil code. Indeed, we do not yet have these codes, but among the above-mentioned more than 4,000 laws and regulations, according to statistics, there are more than 280 separate laws and regulations of criminal law and civil law and laws and regulations with the nature of criminal law and civil law. As long as one recognizes the proletarian revolution, one should know that before the large-scale, storm-like mass class struggle has basically ended, and before the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically completed, it is not only very difficult to formulate a complete criminal code and civil code, but also absurd. The absurdity is no different from forcing an unborn fetus to wear clothes. In fact, we know that the question they raised is not fundamentally about whether there is a criminal code or a civil code. Otherwise, why did the rightist element Yang Zhaolong, who advocates the theory of no law, answer people by saying, "My opinion is not a matter of one article at a time, but a matter of the entire system" after the draft of the criminal law has already been made? Otherwise, why are some "jurists" not very interested in our drafting of socialist criminal law and civil law, but insist on formulating a "law on punishing false accusations" and a so-called "law on compensation for unjust imprisonment" as soon as possible? The question is very obvious. Their so-called "no law" means there is no law that meets their so-called "rule of law" of "giving democracy to counter-revolutionaries."

While clamoring that "there is no law to follow," they raised the "issue of the legislative work line." They desperately attacked the Party's consistent adherence to the policy of proceeding from reality, summarizing experience, gradually perfecting, and mass line in legal work. They described such a correct policy as "the root cause of slow legislation." The rightist elements Yang Yuqing, Yu Zhongluo, and others viciously portrayed it as "the self-intoxication of the Ah Q spirit." How can we quickly establish "law"? They said very clearly that we should oppose "legislative decentralism," and should extensively recruit "insiders," establish a so-called "Law Revision Hall," and want "Hu Hanmin" to be reborn; especially important is that the Party should "withdraw the past instructions on abolishing the Six Codes," saying that "the Party's criticism of the viewpoints of the Six Codes in the past should be corrected," and "as long as the two words 'the people' are added to the old Six Codes, they can still be used." This is the "legislative work line" that they proposed that is completely contrary to us. The reason why they unreasonably denigrate and oppose this fundamental work line of proceeding from reality is to further create ideological confusion among those old legal personnel who have not been well transformed, arrange for a "comeback," and prepare for the restoration of the old legal system.

The rightist elements in the legal circles always gnash their teeth when they mention the judicial reform movement carried out nationwide more than four years ago, saying that it was "a mess" and that it "created contradictions between Party and non-Party members in the legal circles." At the same time, they desperately denigrated the Party's leadership over judicial work, saying that "the presence of Communist Party members in judicial organs is in conflict with promoting democracy and implementing the people's democratic dictatorship"; they tried their best to uglify the current old workers and peasants, saying that they were "not as good as the old judicial personnel in the past," and wanted to "change the judicial cadre policy that used to prioritize politics." They roared and proposed to investigate the responsibility for judicial reform, and to "reform the judiciary again." How to reform again? That is to let the old legal personnel "come to power," "make a big change," and seize the "knife handle."

Was the judicial reform messed up? As everyone knows, judicial reform was a democratic reform movement launched after the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti" movement, targeting the serious impure phenomena existing in the judicial organs at that time in terms of politics, organization, and ideology. It was an indispensable mass political struggle and ideological struggle for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Its historical significance lies in the fact that it defended and implemented the Common Program and the judicial work line of the people's revolution throughout history. It purified the people's judicial organs at all levels, enabling many cadres to ideologically draw a clear line between the new and old legal principles, thereby laying the foundation for the further development of national legal system construction; it lies in the fact that it correctly implemented the Party's policy towards the old legal personnel. In addition to clearing out a very small number of bad elements, all of them were retained or re-arranged for work through training, learning, and various specific measures such as organizing participation in the exercise of actual struggle for a period of time, so that many people were ideologically transformed and became real people's legal workers. This is an indisputable fact. However, some "jurists" completely negated such an important historical experience in the construction of our national legal system, insisting that judicial reform "killed the old judicial personnel with one blow." So there was "summoning souls," "rescuing," "the legal circles are not contending but mourning," and "more importantly, to absorb nutrients from the dead," making it seem like ghosts were crying and howling.

Speaking of which, this is also a good thing. This educated us that the "knife handle" is important; this reminded us that the historical task of judicial reform has not been completely completed, and we must continue to struggle!

The rightist elements in the legal circles also released many poisonous arrows targeting political and legal education. The focus of the attack was the adjustment of political and legal departments that had been carried out in the past. They said that this was a "prominent manifestation of sectarianism" in legal education, "kicking away the old law professors and packing it with Party and League members."

Everyone understands that the rightist elements are spreading lies all over the sky. Taking the law departments of Beijing, Wuhan, Northwest, and Fudan universities as an example, according to statistics, among the existing lecturers and above, the so-called old law professors account for about 70%, Party member old cadres only account for 20%, and the rest are young teachers. Taking the four political and legal colleges in Beijing, East China, Central South, and Southwest as examples, according to statistics, the so-called old law professors also account for nearly half of the lecturers and above. May I ask, is this called "all the same"?

Everyone also understands that the education in old China, especially political and legal education, served the Kuomintang's reactionary ruling class, and a series of fundamental reforms must be carried out. At that time, the government's steps to adjust the political and legal departments were to first concentrate on running several political and legal colleges, actively transforming old teachers and cultivating new teachers, and then gradually re-establish the law departments of various universities. This is completely correct. Now some old law professors also say that it was completely necessary to temporarily not open classes and learn before teaching, which is really a good thing. However, some people describe this good thing as: "The old jurists were attacked and had no skin left, took money and did not open classes, and even their sons scolded them as rice buckets. This is such a painful accusation." May I ask, who are they accusing?

In order to overturn the adjustment of the political and legal departments in the past, the rightist elements tried their best to slander that the Party member old cadres "can only talk about Marxism-Leninism and are laymen in law," while the young cadres are "dogmatic, ten monks chanting the same scripture"; they desperately boasted that they were "authorities in law," negated legal education with Marxism as the guiding ideology, and nonsense that "legal science has regressed by twenty years." Therefore, they shouted loudly, "Red experts get out!" "Old law professors return to the team!" At the same time, they actively carried out the conspiracy of "re-adjusting" the political and legal departments. Now the facts have been revealed that in the capital's legal circles, the rightist group Qian Duansheng, Wang Tieya, Lou Bangyan, etc., had long been deliberately making various arrangements for "returning to the team" in order to realize the so-called "large law school," "large international relations department," and "large law research institute" program that did not want the leadership of the Party committee or the leadership of the business department. Because they fully understood the important significance of occupying the political and legal education position.

IV

From all the above, it can be clearly seen that the attack of the rightist elements in the legal circles on the national legal system is theoretically prepared, and has a program, a plan, and a line. Now their reactionary conspiracy has been exposed. In the face of truth, they have to admit that they have made mistakes. However, many of them take the posture of "lawyers" appearing in court, and adopt the so-called "four-sided exchange, opening the door back and forth" to make "self-criticism," saying that what he "originally said does not represent his thoughts," and that the mistake was accidental. In fact, people are very clear that they have never fundamentally and are unwilling to change their bourgeois world outlook for a long time. As they said, their means of production are the theoretical viewpoints of old jurisprudence, so they cannot be transformed. Therefore, as long as there is an opportunity, they will use their own viewpoints to transform our political and legal system. What's more, some of them have long been anti-Communist and anti-people "heroes," and have long had other intentions. Therefore, this is by no means an accidental thing. Now, the question lies here. Where do they go from here? First of all, it depends on whether they truly recognize this point.

The struggle has educated the people and every legal work cadre that the bourgeoisie will not be willing to withdraw from the stage of history after being deprived of its economic base, and the reactionary old legal viewpoints are the ideological weapons used by political careerists to attempt to restore. Therefore, the struggle to thoroughly eliminate the old legal viewpoints is still an arduous task for our legal circles.

The struggle is deepening and unfolding. This is a great debate in the legal circles, a decisive struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the legal superstructure. Without winning this struggle, it is impossible to further strengthen and consolidate the socialist legal system. Our task is to improve ourselves, improve our work, and solve a series of fundamental problems in our legal system construction and legal science through this debate and struggle, so that our various legal work can better serve the country's socialist construction.
