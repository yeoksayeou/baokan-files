Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 28th – Hebei Province can report a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year. According to materials from relevant leading departments in the province: this year, the yield per unit area of more than one hundred million mu of grain fields in Hebei Province is expected to reach 196 jin, an increase of 9.5% compared to the bumper year of 1955, with eight counties achieving a high yield of 400 jin per mu. The total grain output of the province can reach 20 billion jin, an increase of 9.9% compared to 1955, exceeding the state plan by 5.8%. This year, the yield per unit area of cotton (lint) in the province can reach 43.29 jin, which is the highest record in the history of Hebei cotton production, an increase of 8.55% compared to 1955; the total output is expected to reach 629 million jin. Although the cotton planting area in the province has decreased by 12.26% compared to 1955, the total output has only decreased by 7.6%.

Last year was the first year for Hebei Province to realize agricultural cooperation, but due to the unprecedented flood, it failed to achieve increased production. This year, these agricultural cooperatives, relying on their own superior conditions and the support of the state, continued to vigorously build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, overcoming different natural disasters in some areas; at the same time, they developed pig raising and manure accumulation, and carried out a number of technical reforms, finally achieving a bumper harvest. Although the Xizhaomulian Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Yongnian County planted cotton on 65% of its land, and each person only had nine fen of grain fields, the members turned 700 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and applied 8,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, so that the total grain output of the cooperative reached 682 jin per mu, and the cotton (lint) output was 70 jin per mu. This cooperative changed from a grain shortage of 60,000 jin to a grain surplus of 150,000 jin, and the average income of each member reached 188 yuan, exceeding the production and living standards of the local rich middle peasants. Such cooperatives are no longer isolated cases in Hebei Province.

    河北省粮棉都告丰收
    粮食比丰收的1955年增产百分之九点五；棉花单位面积产量创本省最高纪录
    新华社保定28日电　河北省今年粮棉可告丰收。根据省里有关领导部门的材料：今年河北全省一亿多亩粮田的单位面积产量预计能达到一百九十六斤，比丰收的1955年提高9.5％，有八个县达到了亩产四百斤的高额产量。全省粮食总产量可以达到二百亿斤，比1955年增产9.9％，超额5.8％完成国家计划。今年，全省棉花（皮棉）单位面积产量可以达到四十三点二九斤，这是河北棉花产量有史以来的最高纪录，比1955年提高8.55％；总产量预计能达到六亿二千九百万斤。虽然全省植棉面积比1955年减少了12.26％，总产量却只少了7.6％。
    去年是河北省实现农业合作化的第一年，但是由于遭受到空前的水灾袭击，未能实现增产。今年，这些农业社依靠自己的优越条件和国家的支持，继续大力兴修小型农田水利，战胜了部分地区的不同自然灾害；同时发展养猪积肥和进行了多项技术改革，终于获得丰收。永年县西赵目连五星农业社虽然65％的土地种棉，每人只有九分粮田，但由于社员们把七百亩旱地变为水田，每亩地施肥八千斤，使全社今年的粮食产量每亩达到了六百八十二斤，棉花（皮棉）每亩产七十斤。这个社由缺粮六万斤变为余粮十五万斤，每个社员的平均收入达到一百八十八元，生产水平和生活水平都超过了当地富裕中农。这样的社，现在河北省已经不是个别的。
