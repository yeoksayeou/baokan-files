    Beijing Youth Peking Opera Troupe Officially Performs
    The Beijing Youth Peking Opera Troupe, with young actors as its backbone, was established on the 20th. This is a result of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture's implementation of the spirit of rectifying while rectifying during this rectification movement, accepting the opinions put forward by the actors, and providing support and assistance.
    80% of the actors in the Beijing Youth Peking Opera Troupe are young people under the age of thirty. They jointly formulated eight regulations: no competition for seniority, no competition for repertory, no competition for scores, and compliance with discipline. They will also carry forward the hard-working style of young people and go deep into factories, rural areas, and troops to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers. The main actors of the troupe include Li Yuanchun, Zhang Wenjuan, Li Yunqiu, Yu Shiwen, and Li Kaiping. Li Yuanchun is the head of the troupe. They began their official performances in the capital on the 20th.
