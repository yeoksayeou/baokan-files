Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: TASS, New York, September 27th: Kuznetsov, Deputy Head of the Soviet Delegation to the UN General Assembly, held a press conference on the 27th, and read out the Soviet Delegation's statement on the upcoming by-election for three non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Kuznetsov pointed out that certain countries currently have a tendency to weaken the role of the Security Council and undermine relevant agreements on the regional allocation of non-permanent Security Council seats. He said that it is possible and necessary to enhance the role of the United Nations in international affairs. To achieve this, it is required that certain countries abandon their intention of turning this global organization into a tool for their own policies against other countries.

Kuznetsov pointed out that, according to the London Gentlemen's Agreement, the right of Eastern European countries to be represented on the Security Council is beyond doubt. Eastern European countries were elected as non-permanent members of the Security Council during the first few elections. However, recently a certain group of countries, primarily the United States and some countries that support it in the United Nations, have opposed the election of Eastern European countries to the Security Council. As a result, the London Agreement on granting Eastern European countries a non-permanent seat in this body has been undermined. This practice is a violation of the principles of the United Nations.

The Soviet representative pointed out that Czechoslovakia, which is now nominated as a candidate to represent the Eastern European region for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, was one of the first countries in Europe to suffer from fascist aggression. Throughout the war, the Czechoslovak people fought against the Hitler occupation forces. Therefore, we hope that all UN member states who truly wish to turn the Security Council into a truly representative body will vote for Czechoslovakia to be a non-permanent member of the Security Council.

    库兹涅佐夫斥美英破坏伦敦协定
    支持捷代表竞选安理会席位
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社纽约27日讯：出席联合国大会的苏联代表团副团长库兹涅佐夫27日举行记者招待会，宣读了苏联代表团关于即将补选联合国安全理事会三个非常任理事国一事的声明。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，某些国家目前有削弱安全理事会的作用和破坏按地区分配非常任理事国席位的有关协定的倾向。他说，联合国在国际事务中的作用是有可能而且应当加以提高的。要做到这一点，就要求某些国家放弃它们的这样一种打算：把这个世界性组织变为自己反对其他国家政策的工具。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，按照伦敦君子协定，承认东欧国家在安全理事会中的代表权是毫无疑问的事。东欧国家在最初的几次选举期间都当选了安全理事会的非常任理事国。但是，最近某一国家集团，首先就是美国以及在联合国里支持它的一些国家，反对把东欧国家选进安全理事会。这样一来，关于在这个机构中给予东欧国家以一个非常任理事国席位的伦敦协定就被破坏了。这种作法是违反联合国原则的。
    苏联代表指出，现在被提名作为代表东欧地区的安全理事会非常任理事国候选人的捷克斯洛伐克，是欧洲首先遭到法西斯侵略之害的国家之一。在整个战争过程中，捷克斯洛伐克人民都为反对希特勒占领军而进行斗争。因此，我们希望一切真正愿意把安全理事会变成一个具有真正代表性机构的联合国会员国，都投票选举捷克斯洛伐克为安全理事会非常任理事国。
