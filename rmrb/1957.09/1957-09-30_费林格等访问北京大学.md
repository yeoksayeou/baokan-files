Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The faculty and students of Peking University warmly and solemnly received the envoys of the Czechoslovak people who came to visit this morning.

At 9:40 a.m., when the Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation headed by Chairman Fierlinger and the Prague Central People's Committee delegation headed by Mayor Svoboda arrived, President Ma Yinchu and more than 1,000 faculty and students lined the road at the school gate and in front of Linhu Xuan to welcome them.

Chairman Fierlinger spoke at the welcoming meeting. He pointed out: The Czechoslovak people must consolidate their friendship with the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. The socialist camp has strong political and moral strength, as well as strong national defense forces. Our strength is always greater than that of imperialism. However, we do not want war and believe that the word "war" can be completely deleted from the human dictionary.

Fierlinger also talked about the rapid progress of education in Czechoslovakia after its liberation. He emphasized that intellectuals must love the people, stand with the working people, and become true patriots. Intellectuals must support the Communist Party and socialism, unite with the people of the whole country, and work together towards socialism, so that everyone can feel gratified for participating in the great cause of transforming society.

Mayor Svoboda extended greetings and congratulations to the faculty and students of Peking University on behalf of the people and university students of Prague.

Moimir Fucik, Vice President of the Medical School of Charles University, also spoke at the meeting as a member of the delegation.

Krenhova-Beserova, a member of the delegation, representing the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Youth League, presented the Honorary Fucik Medal, awarded for outstanding educators, to President Ma Yinchu.

At the meeting, President Ma Yinchu also presented the Peking University Journal and commemorative badges to the distinguished guests. After the meeting, the delegation also visited the international student dormitory and the Department of Biology.

In the afternoon, the distinguished guests of the two delegations visited the gymnasium and the Temple of Heaven.

The National Women's Federation held a tea party in the afternoon to welcome the women representatives in the two delegations.
