    A Perspective on British "Freedom of Speech"
    Gao Hong, Li Yichuan
    "Hyde Park" Where "Poisonous Weeds Grow Rampant"
    Every Sunday afternoon, many people in London erect platforms in "Hyde Park" to give speeches. It does attract a lot of listeners. However, people never treat it as a serious place, but rather as an indispensable source of amusement in the park.
    Here, you can see all kinds of speakers. They are: Conservatives, fascists, Trotskyites, the Salvation Army, missionaries, horse racing fanatics, and even swindlers.
    A self-proclaimed missionary declared: "God told me that Nasser stole the (Suez) Canal!"
    "...Britain and the United States are both English-speaking nations. Britain's economic level is low. If it doesn't borrow US dollars, Britain won't survive. Without the United States, we can't do anything." This is another speaker preaching the doctrine of "American Supremacy."
    A man with a full black beard was complaining that modern women love to dress up too much. He advocated "natural beauty," just as he "can still win women's kisses without shaving."
    Listening to these "free" speeches, one cannot help but recall what a British friend said, that here, it's not "letting a hundred flowers bloom," but rather "poisonous weeds growing rampant."
    Of course, the British authorities do not need to interfere with these "free" speeches. It is very clear that some people are making wild statements here and spreading chaos, which is not harmful to the ruling class. On the contrary, it is an embellishment of bourgeois "democracy."
    Fragrant Flowers are Trampled Here
    But even in this small corner, can the working people have real freedom of speech? There are many facts that can answer this question. You will see that whenever communists appear, the police immediately follow them and register the speaker's name, occupation, and workplace one by one for investigation. Some clauses in the "Hyde Park" regulations are often cited to restrict the activities of the Communist Party. For example, the regulations stipulate that speakers are "not allowed to imply where a certain commodity...can be obtained." Therefore, communists cannot introduce the "Daily Worker" in "Hyde Park."
    In July of this year, when the British Communist Party held a demonstration demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb testing, "Hyde Park" was the gathering point for the队伍. They were restricted: no drumming, no raising flags. Therefore, when the crowds entered the park, they had to lower their flags and stop drumming. However, on the day before this demonstration, a right-wing group held a conference in "Hyde Park," and they enjoyed all the freedom and convenience. This year on "May Day," the British Communist Party held a mass rally in "Hyde Park." Their truck, organized to supply drinks, was refused entry to the park because it did not receive "approval" from the Ministry of Labour, causing many parents with children to be unable to attend the rally.
    During the "May Day" parade in 1955, the crowds had just started from "Hyde Park" when they were immediately stopped by the police, and more than a hundred people were arrested. It is said that this was because of "obstructing traffic" and "disturbing the peace."
    Speech Organs Highly Concentrated
    Even if you are given this corner to speak freely, when newspapers, radio, television and all other propaganda machines are firmly in the hands of the bourgeoisie, how much use and value does this small point of "democracy" and "freedom" in the corner of "Hyde Park" really have? Just compare it: only a few hundred people listen to speeches in "Hyde Park" every Sunday; while the daily circulation of British newspapers is 30 million copies. Except for the "Daily Worker," all 135 national daily newspapers and 17 Sunday newspapers are controlled by the bourgeoisie; and like other enterprises, they are concentrated in the hands of a few large capitalists. Currently, this monopoly has reached an alarming level: 60% of the circulation of national and local daily newspapers is concentrated in the hands of four major groups. They are: Cecil King, Rothmere, Beaverbrook, and Kemsley.
    In this situation, it is almost impossible for people outside these large monopoly groups to start a national newspaper. In the past thirty years, only two new newspapers have been founded: one is the "Daily Worker" and the other is the "Daily Chronicle." The latter collapsed less than five months after its launch due to heavy debts. The "Daily Worker" is also constantly in a difficult position in terms of circulation and finance because of the planned boycott and restrictions by capitalists. Many newspapers have gradually been merged by large monopoly groups.
    Monopoly Power Belongs to the Bourgeoisie
    In order to reliably control the weapon of newspapers and turn them into factories for manufacturing public opinion, the bourgeoisie closely combine economic monopoly with political control. They have set very strict conditions for participating in the operation of certain important newspapers, making it difficult for people outside the monopoly groups to get involved. For example, if you want to buy shares in "The Times," you must be approved by a committee. The members of this committee are: the Lord Chancellor, the Warden of All Souls College Oxford, the President of the Royal Society, the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the governor of The bank of england, etc.
    "The Economist," "The Spectator," "The Yorkshire Post" and other newspapers also have similar regulations.
    The monopolists of newspapers and other monopoly groups and their political representatives have countless connections. The bourgeoisie supports newspapers with 200 million pounds annually in the form of advertisements. Without this support, it is hard to imagine that these newspapers could continue to be published. For example, in the past year, the Beaverbrook Group received 9 million pounds from newspaper sales, while advertising revenue was 9.5 million pounds. Many newspaper tycoons are also directors of certain large monopoly enterprises. For example, Astor, the owner of "The Times," is a director of Barclays Bank and Hambros Bank.
    "Purely for Propaganda"
    But do capitalists run newspapers only to make money? Of course not. The policy of newspapers serving the bourgeoisie is unshakable. Beaverbrook once said: "I run newspapers purely for propaganda, nothing else." And this propaganda is to support "policies that he considers important." Robertson, the chairman of the "London Express" Company, said of Beaverbrook: "He has never held any official position in name. He has not been a director of the newspaper since 1920. However, there is no doubt that he is the owner of the newspaper. Lord Beaverbrook is naturally the policy maker and daily decision maker..."
    Who are the people who faithfully serve this propaganda policy? Kemsley, one of the four giants of the British press, said that his editors are "people who hold the same views as me. It is simply superfluous to tell them what my views are on an issue."
    The Boss's Faithful Mouthpiece
    This makes it unnecessary to explain further why these newspapers are so loyal to maintaining the interests of the bourgeoisie. For example, when British workers held the largest national strike since 1926 this spring, all the major newspapers published full-page statements from British employers, declaring that "the strike harms everyone." Only the "Daily Worker" and the "Daily Herald" (at that time, half of its shares were still held by the British Trades Union Congress) refused to publish this advertisement. After the capitalists had to increase wages a little to end the struggle, all the bourgeois newspapers then publicized that increasing wages caused inflation. They propagated this to pave the way for the capitalists' new offensive against the workers.
    In international propaganda, the position of the bourgeois newspapers is equally clear. Last year, when the British people and world opinion denounced the Anglo-French aggression in Egypt, British newspapers seemed to have received "God's will" and changed their tune overnight, using the "Hungarian Incident" to play an anti-Soviet march. According to British friends familiar with the inside story of the British press: the British Foreign Office has a press conference every day at noon; all British and foreign reporters can attend this. Every afternoon, the Foreign Office has another "small" "private" press conference, attended only by reporters from "The Times," "The Manchester Guardian," and "The Daily Mail." Officials from the Foreign Office give instructions at this meeting.
    The Difficult Situation of Progressive Newspapers
    Right-wingers say that capitalist countries allow the Communist Party to run newspapers, and the working class also enjoys "freedom of speech." Then, let them look at the situation of the British Communist Party's "Daily Worker." In Britain, it takes at least three million pounds of capital to publish a newspaper. The "Daily Worker" does not have one-thousandth of this amount. It only relies on the support of the working masses to barely survive.
    In capitalist countries, advertising revenue is an important source of income for newspapers. The Beaverbrook Group mentioned above is an example. But the "Daily Worker's" income in this area is less than 4% of its total income. When the newspaper was a month old, wholesale agencies refused to distribute it, and the working masses had to take on this task themselves, delivering the newspaper to retail agencies and even readers, which continued for twelve years. Even now, it is still quite difficult to buy a copy of the "Daily Worker" on a newsstand in London.
    After introducing these important facts about "freedom of speech" in Britain, regarding the "Hyde Park" style "democracy" in Britain, we might as well end with a sentence from Labour Party MP Frank Allaun. In the House of Commons debate on May 17th this year, he spoke about the so-called "freedom of the press" in Britain. He said, "When freedom of the press means that a few millionaires publish news that suits their tastes and delete news that does not suit their tastes, freedom of the press is just empty talk."

    英国“言论自由”的透视
    高虹　李一川
    “毒草丛生”的“海德公园”
    每逢星期日下午，不少人在伦敦的“海德公园”里架起讲台，发表演说。它的确招来不少听众。可是，人们从不把它当作严肃的场所，而是把它看作这个公园内不可缺少的寻开心的地方。
    在这里，你可以看到形形色色的演讲者。他们是：保守党人，法西斯分子，托洛茨基分子，救世军，传教士，赛马狂热者，以至于骗子。
    一个自命为传教士的人声言：“上帝告诉我，纳赛尔抢走了（苏伊士）运河！”
    “……英国和美国同是说英语的民族，英国经济水平低，要不借美元的话，英国就活不下去。没有美国，我们就什么也干不成。”这是另一个演讲者在宣扬“美国至上”的教义。
    一个满腮黑胡子的人在那里埋怨现在的女人太爱打扮了。他提倡“自然的美”，就如他“不刮胡子仍然可以博得女人的亲吻”一样。
    听了这些“自由”的言论，不能不想起一位英国朋友所说的，在这里，不是“百花齐放”，而是“毒草丛生”。
    对于这些“自由”的言论，英国当局当然用不着去干涉。事情很清楚，一些人在这里大放厥词，散布混乱，对统治阶级并无害处。相反，它倒是资产阶级“民主”的一种点缀。
    香花在这里受摧残
    但是，即便在这个小小的角落里，劳动人民能有讲话的真正自由吗？有许多的事实可以回答这个问题。你会看到，每当共产党人出现的时候，警察立即跟踪而至，并把讲话人的姓名、职业和工作单位，一一登记，以便查究。“海德公园”条例中的一些款项，常常被引用来限制共产党的活动。例如，条例中规定，演讲者“不准暗示某种商品……在何处可以得到”。因而，共产党人就不能在“海德公园”介绍“工人日报”。
    今年7月，英共举行要求停止氢弹试验的示威，“海德公园”是集合队伍的地点。他们被限制：不准敲锣打鼓，不准高举旗帜。因而，当群众队伍进入公园之后，不得不偃旗息鼓。但是，就在这一次示威的前一天，一个右派团体在“海德公园”举行了大会，他们享有了一切自由和方便。今年“五一”，英共在“海德公园”举行群众大会。他们组织的供应饮料的卡车，因为没有得到劳工部的“批准”，被拒于公园门外，致使许多有孩子的父母不能参加大会。
    1955年“五一”游行的时候，群众队伍刚从“海德公园”出发，马上就被警察拉住，一百多人被捕。据说这是因为“妨碍交通”和“破坏和平”的缘故。
    言论机关高度集中
    就算给了你这一角的说话的自由，在报纸、电台、电视等所有宣传机器都牢牢掌握在资产阶级手中的时候，“海德公园”这个角落里的这一小点“民主”、“自由”，究竟又有多少作用和价值呢？只要比较一下就行了：每星期日在“海德公园”中听讲的人，不过几百而已；而英国报纸每天的发行额，是三千万份。除了“工人日报”以外，全国一百三十五种日报，十七种星期日报纸，全部为资产阶级所控制；并且也像其它企业一样，集中在少数大资本家之手。目前，这种垄断已经达到惊人的程度：全国性的和地方性的日报，60％的发行量集中在四大集团之手。它们是：西塞尔·金、罗什米尔、比维尔勃鲁克和凯姆斯莱。
    在这种情况下，这些大垄断集团以外的人要想创办一种全国性的报纸，几乎是不可能的。在过去三十年中新创办的报纸只有两种：一是“工人日报”，一是“每日纪事报”。后者在创刊后不到五个月即因负债累累而垮台。“工人日报”因为受到资本家有计划的抵制和限制，也经常处在发行和财政的困难中。不少报纸，都逐渐为大垄断集团所并吞。
    垄断权属于资产阶级
    资产阶级为了可靠地掌握报纸这一武器，把它变成制造舆论的工厂，他们把经济上的垄断和政治上的控制紧紧地结合起来。他们对于要参加某些重要报刊的经营，规定了非常严格的条件，使垄断集团以外的人难以问津。例如，你要买“泰晤士报”的股票，必须经过一个委员会的批准。这个委员会的成员是：司法大臣、万灵会长、皇家协会主席、特许会计师协会主席、英格兰银行行长等。
    “经济学家”、“旁观者”、“约克郡邮报”等报刊，也都有类似的规定。
    报纸的垄断者和其他垄断集团以及他们的政治代表，有着千丝万缕的联系。资产阶级以广告的形式，每年以两亿英镑来支持报纸。没有这种支持，很难设想这些报纸可以继续出版。比如在去年一年中，比维尔勃鲁克集团从报纸销售中得到了九百万英镑，而广告费的收入是九百五十万英镑。很多报业巨头，同时又是某些大垄断企业的董事。例如，“泰晤士报”的老板阿斯脱，就是巴克莱银行和汉姆布鲁斯银行的董事。
    “纯粹是为了宣传”
    但是，资本家办报只是为了赚钱吗？当然不是的。报纸为资产阶级服务的方针，是不容动摇的。比维尔勃鲁克就曾说过：“我办报纯粹是为了宣传，别无其他。”而这种宣传，是为了支持他“认为重要的政策”。“伦敦快报”公司主席罗伯逊在谈到比维尔勃鲁克时说道：“他在名义上从来没有担任过任何职务，他从1920年起就不是报纸的董事了。但是，毫无疑问，他是报纸的主人，比维尔勃鲁克勋爵自然是政策的制定者和每日的决断者……。”
    忠实地为这一宣传方针服务的又是些什么人呢？英国报界四大巨头之一的凯姆斯莱说过：他的编辑都是些和他“抱有同样观点的人物。在一个问题上要告诉他们我的观点是什么，那简直是多余的。”
    当老板的忠实喉舌
    这就用不着再多加解释，为什么这些报纸都如此忠实地维护资产阶级的利益。例如，今春英国工人举行1926年以来最大的全国性罢工时，所有的大报都以整版篇幅登载了英国雇主的联合声明，声言“罢工损害了每一个人”。只有“工人日报”和“每日先驱报”（当时它的一半股票尚为英国职工大会所掌握）拒绝刊登这一广告。当资本家在不得不增加一点工资以结束这场斗争之后，所有的资产阶级报纸又都宣传：增加工资引起了通货膨胀。它们这样宣传是为资本家对工人的新进攻张目。
    在国际宣传上，资产阶级报纸的立场同样是十分明确的。去年，当英国人民和全世界舆论痛斥英法在埃及的侵略行为时，英国报纸似乎得到了“上帝的旨谕”，一夜之间变了调子，假借“匈牙利事件”弹奏起反苏进行曲。据熟悉英国新闻界内幕的英国朋友谈：英国外交部每天中午有个记者招待会；这是所有的英国记者和外国记者都可以参加的。每天下午，外交部另有一个“小小的”“不公开的”记者招待会，出席的只是“泰晤士报”“曼彻斯特卫报”“每日邮报”的记者。外交部的官员在这个会上面授机宜。
    进步报纸处境难
    右派分子们说，资本主义国家允许共产党办报纸，工人阶级也是享有“言论自由”的。那么，请他们看看英共“工人日报”的处境吧，在英国，要出版一个报纸，起码要有三百万英镑的资本。“工人日报”没有这个数字的千分之一，它只是依靠工人群众的支持，才勉强维持下来。
    在资本主义国家，广告费是报纸的重要收入，前面我们提到的比维尔勃鲁克集团就是一个例子。但是“工人日报”在这方面的收入还不到它全部收入的4％。当这个报纸诞生一个月的时候，各地批发机构即拒绝推销，不得不由工人群众自己担负起这个工作，把报纸送到零售机构以至读者手中，如此继续了十二年之久。直到现在，你要想在伦敦的报摊上买一份“工人日报”，仍然是相当困难的。
    在介绍了英国“言论自由”的这些重要情况之后，关于英国的“海德公园”式“民主”，我们不妨以工党议员弗兰克·阿隆的一句话来作结束语。他在今年5月17日的下院辩论中，谈到了在英国的所谓“新闻自由”。他说，“当新闻自由意味着少数百万富翁发表适合他们味道的新闻、删掉不适合他们味道的新闻的时候，新闻自由只不过是一句空话。”
