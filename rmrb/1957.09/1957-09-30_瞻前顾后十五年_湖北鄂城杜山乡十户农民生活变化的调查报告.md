    The Vision of a New Socialist Countryside
    Chairman Mao proposed consolidating agricultural cooperatives in about five years. Consolidation needs to be approached from two aspects: on the one hand, continuously increasing production and income of the cooperatives to further improve the economic living standards of the peasants; on the other hand, strengthening political and ideological work in rural areas, and extensively and deeply conducting socialist propaganda and education among the broad masses of peasants. This spring, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward an objective for economically consolidating cooperatives to all peasants and rural cadres in the province, requiring 80%-90% of agricultural cooperatives in the province to achieve the following within three years (1956-1958): the total income of the cooperatives should increase by more than 50% compared to 1955 (the year before cooperativization), the cooperatives should accumulate sufficient production expenses, the net income of the members should increase by more than 30%, and the living standards of most poor peasants should rise to the level of middle peasants or prosperous middle peasants; strive to achieve the following within seven years (1956-1962): the total income of the cooperatives should increase by more than double compared to 1955, the cooperatives should have sufficient farm tools, cattle, feed, and seeds, and have surplus production expenses for one year, and most members should have enough to eat, wear, use, and have surplus.
    According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the specific conditions of the cooperative, the Xuguang First Cooperative has initially formulated a long-term plan. The income of the cooperative and its members, as well as the changes in the living conditions of the members, are listed below:

    Project	1955	1956	1957	1958	Percentage increase compared to 1955	1962	Percentage increase compared to 1955
    Total income of the cooperative in each year	128,000 yuan	203,000 yuan	323,000 yuan	388,000 yuan	203%	463,000 yuan	261.7%
    Average net income per member household	352 yuan	496 yuan	798 yuan	966 yuan	174.4%	1122 yuan	218.7
    Changes in the living conditions of members
    Households in Difficulty	53 households	16 households	6 households	0	0
    General Households	164 households	69 households	31 households	20 households	0
    Prosperous Households	58 households	190 households	238 households	255 households	275 households
    Note: This cooperative currently has 275 member households. The terms "households in difficulty," "general households," and "prosperous households" are calculated based on the following standards: Households in difficulty: average annual income per person is between 40-60 yuan; General households: average annual income per person is between 70-90 yuan; Prosperous households: average annual income per person is over 100 yuan.
    The long-term plan of this cooperative, all indicators greatly exceed the requirements put forward by the Provincial Party Committee. The Management Committee has submitted this preliminary plan to all members for discussion, which has further enhanced the members' confidence in running the cooperative well and building a new socialist countryside.
    Under the guidance of the cooperative's long-term plan, the ten peasant households surveyed have also tentatively formulated their respective family economic life plans. Each household's plan considers the following three aspects: how much the annual net income will increase, how many workdays are planned each year, and how much the value of each labor point will increase each year. According to the ten peasant households themselves, their family plans have set the various indicators slightly lower than those of the cooperative in order to be more reliable, and they generally express confidence in realizing this beautiful long-term plan.
    The Plans of Three Poor Peasant Households: The net income of these three poor peasant households in 1956 increased by 44.6% compared to 1955. The requirement proposed by the Provincial Party Committee to strive to increase the net income of members by more than 30% within three years, these three poor peasant households—as well as the vast majority of poor peasants in the cooperative—achieved in the first year. These three poor peasant households plan to strive for an additional increase of 40%-50% in net income in the next two years on the basis of 1956, reaching an average net income of more than 660 yuan per household by 1958, which is more than 1.1 times higher than in 1955 (average income of 314 yuan per household). That is to say, they achieved the Provincial Party Committee's seven-year plan requirement four years ahead of schedule.
    From 1959 to 1962, these three poor peasant households strive to increase their net income by about 50% on the basis of 1958, reaching an average income of 990 yuan per household by 1962, which is more than 2.1 times higher than in 1955.
    For these three poor peasant households, special expenditures will gradually decrease in the future, and normal living consumption will gradually increase. They plan to increase their living standards to 30% higher than in 1955 (an average of 60 yuan per person per year) by 1958, with living expenses of nearly 80 yuan per person per year, catching up with the current level of prosperous middle peasants. By 1962, the living standards will be more than 60% higher than in 1955, with living expenses of 100 yuan per person per year. They feel that if the living standard, whether spending a lot or a little, can reach 100 yuan, then "no matter how you calculate it, there's nothing to say."
    With the realization of this plan, not only will living standards gradually improve, but there will also be savings every year. Two poor peasant households have paid off their debts this year. By 1958, the average savings per household can be more than 100 yuan, and thereafter each household can save about 150 yuan per year, accumulating 600 yuan per household by 1962. With so much savings per household, they can easily survive a famine year.
    The Plans of Three General Middle Peasant Households: The rate of increase in their annual income, the speed of improvement in living standards, and the savings plans are all more than 10% higher than those of the existing poor peasants. They have strong labor power, small deficits, and are taking bigger steps forward than the poor peasants.
    The Plans of Four Prosperous Middle Peasant Households: The net income of prosperous middle peasants in 1956 only increased by 8% compared to 1955. They plan to increase their net income by more than 30% by 1958 compared to 1955, with an average income of more than 1,350 yuan per household. By 1962, their income will increase by 25%-30% compared to 1955, with an average income of more than 1,600 yuan per household. They have calculated that the annual living standards per person will increase from the original 80 yuan to about 120 yuan, and each household can save 150-250 yuan per year, accumulating about 1,200 yuan per household by 1962.
    Finally, we also learned about the long-term plans for rural infrastructure construction and cultural and welfare undertakings from these ten peasant households and the township and cooperative cadres here. When they talked about it, they were even more enthusiastic, beaming with joy. Currently, the state has established a tractor station and a pumping station in Dushan Township; in the future, with the development of production and the demands of the peasants, appropriate expansion will be gradually carried out. In terms of cultural welfare, clinics and midwifery stations have also been established; the cooperative has a club, an amateur theater troupe, and a basketball team. After this autumn's bumper harvest, they plan to establish a volleyball team, set up a nursery, and prepare to buy a slide projector. Before 1962, the cooperative also plans to add a kindergarten, run a complete primary school on its own, and establish a song and dance troupe, a folk band, and a library. In addition, a "Greening Park" will be opened on the open space along the Changgang River, and trees will be planted every year from now on.
    These ten peasant households also have their own plans. For example, Xiao Shijin, a prosperous middle peasant, has already deposited 160 yuan and plans to gradually increase his deposits to a total of 1,600 yuan by 1962; at that time, he will use this deposit, in addition to using the original housing materials, to buy some more building materials and build a two-story small building himself. Other middle and poor peasant households also plan to manage their families diligently and thriftily on the basis of increasing production, gradually increasing family savings, and in the future, according to their own economic conditions, either change small houses into large houses or buildings, or change small windows (the windows of peasants' houses here are generally very small, and the indoor light is dim) into large windows, or change thatched houses into tile-roofed houses.
    It can be seen from here that after cooperativization, the peasants' plans for "building a family and establishing a career" have also changed: In the past, the "centennial plan" of ordinary peasants was "buy fields first, then build houses." Now, the land has been entered into the cooperative and is uniformly managed; they have shifted their family-building plan to gradually improving living conditions. In short, the peasants are optimistic about building a new socialist countryside, and they place great hope and full confidence in the beautiful vision of the new countryside.
    Of course, the current level of production is still very low; we must also pay attention to running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and managing the family diligently and thriftily, first and foremost putting more manpower, materials, and financial resources into developing production. In this way, there will be a more solid foundation for improving living standards.
                                                (The End)

    社会主义新农村的远景
    毛主席提出在五年左右巩固农业合作社。巩固工作需从两方面着手：一方面使合作社不断地增加生产、增加收入，继续提高农民的经济生活水平；另方面加强农村政治思想工作，广泛深入地向广大农民进行社会主义的宣传教育。今年春天，中共湖北省委员会曾向全省农民和农村干部提出一个在经济上巩固合作社的努力目标，即要求全省80％—90％的农业社在三年内（1956—1958年）做到：合作社的总收入比1955年（即合作化前一年）增加50％以上，社内积累有足够的生产费用，社员的纯收入增加到30％以上，大部分贫农的生活上升到中农或富裕中农的生活水平；争取在七年内（1956—1962年）做到：合作社的总收入比1955年增加一倍以上，社内农具、耕牛、饲料、种籽准备充足，而且存余一年的生产费用，大部分社员做到有吃、有穿、有用还有余。
    旭光一社根据省委的指示和本社的具体情况，已经初步制订出一个远景规划，现将其中关于社和社员的收入以及社员生活变化情况，列表如下：
    项目1955年1956年1957年1958年与1955年比较增长百分比1962年与1955年比较增长百分比全社各年总收入12.8万元20.3万元32.3万元38.8万元203％46.3万元261.7％每户社员平均纯收        
  入352元496元798元966元174.4％1122　元218.7社员生活变化困难户53户16户6户00一般户164户69户31户20户0富裕户58户190户238户255户275户说明这个社现有275户社员，这里所指的困难户、一般户和富裕户，是以这样一个标准来计算的：困难户，每人每年平均收入在40—60元之间；一般户，每人每年平均收入在70—90元之间；富裕户，每人每年平均收入在100元以上。
    这个社的远景规划，各项指标都大大地超过了省委所提出的要求。管理委员会曾把这个初步规划交给全体社员讨论，更加提高了社员们办好合作社、建设社会主义新农村的信心。
    被调查的十户农民，在合作社的远景规划的指导下，也初步订出各自的家庭经济生活规划。各户的规划都是从这样三个方面考虑：即每年的纯收入增加多少，每年计划做多少个工作日，每年劳动工分的分值增加多少。据十户农民自己说：他们的家庭规划为了更牢靠一些，各项指标订的一般比合作社的低些，普遍表示有信心实现这个美好的远景规划。
    三户贫农的规划：这三户贫农，1956年纯收入比1955年增加44.6％。省委所提争取三年内使社员纯收入增加30％以上的要求，这三户贫农——该社绝大多数贫农也是这样——在第一年里就实现了。这三户贫农计划，在今明两年内的纯收入，争取在1956年基础上再增加40％—50％，到1958年平均每户纯收入达到六百六十元以上，比1955年（每户平均收入三百一十四元）增加一点一倍以上，就是说提前四年达到了省委的七年规划要求。
    从1959年至1962年这四年当中，这三户贫农纯收入争取在1958年基础上再增加50％左右，到1962年平均每户收入为九百九十元，比1955年增加二点一倍以上。
    这三户贫农，今后特殊开支将逐年减少，正常的生活消费将逐年提高，他们计划到1958年的生活水平比1955年（每人每年平均六十元）提高30％，每人每年生活费用近八十元，即赶上了富裕中农的现有水平。到1962年，生活水平比1955年提高60％以上，每人每年生活费达一百元。他们觉得大口小口的生活水平能达到一百元，就“左算右算，没话说了”。
    实现了这个规划，不仅生活水平将逐年提高，而且年年有存余。有两户贫农今年把债还清，到1958年平均每户可存余百元以上，而后每户每年可存余一百五十元左右，到1962年每户可积蓄六百元。每户有这样多的储蓄，倘若来个荒年就满可以度得过去了。
    三户一般中农的规划：他们今后每年收入的增长幅度和生活水平上升速度以及储蓄计划，都高于现有贫农10％以上。他们劳动力强，亏空小，上升步子比贫农迈的更大些。
    四户富裕中农的规划：富裕中农1956年的纯收入比1955年只增加8％，他们计划到1958年，纯收入比1955年增长30％以上，每户平均收入达到一千三百五十元以上，到1962年收入比1955年增长25％—30％，每户平均收入达到一千六百元以上。他们算了个账，今后将每人每年的生活水平由原来八十元提高到一百二十元左右，每年每户还可存余一百五十——二百五十元，到1962年每户可储蓄一千二百元上下。
    最后，我们还向这十户农民和这里的乡、社干部了解了农村基本建设和文化福利事业的远景规划。他们谈起来更是津津有味，眉飞色舞。现在，国家在杜山乡已经设立了一座拖拉机站和一座抽水机站；将来随着生产的发展和农民的要求，将逐步进行适当的扩建工作。在文化福利方面，目前也设立了诊所和接生站；社里有俱乐部、业余剧团，还有一个篮球队。今年秋季丰收以后，他们计划再成立一个排球队，设一所托儿所，并准备买一部幻灯机。在1962年以前，社里还计划增设一所幼儿院，自办一所完全小学，并成立歌舞团、民间乐队和图书室等。另外，在长港河滨空地上开辟一所“绿化公园”，从现在起每年增植树木。
    这十户农民也都各有打算。如富裕中农肖仕进，现在已存款一百六十元，计划到1962年逐年增加存款共达一千六百元；到那时候，动用这笔存款，除利用原有房屋材料、再添买一些建筑材料，自建一栋二层的小楼房。其他几户中、贫农，也都打算在增加生产的基础上，勤俭治家，逐年增加家庭积蓄，将来根据自己的经济状况，或者将小屋改成大屋或楼房，或将小窗（这里农民住屋的窗户一般很小，室内光线暗淡）改为大窗，或将茅屋改为瓦屋。
    从这里可以看出，合作化以后，农民“兴家立业”的打算也已起了变化：往年，一般农民的“百年大计”是“先买田、后置屋”。现在，土地入了社，统一经营了；他们把兴家之计转移到逐步改善居住条件。总之，农民们是建设社会主义新农村的乐观主义者，他们对新农村的美好远景寄予极大的希望和充沛的信心。
    当然，目前的生产水平还是很低的；还必须注意勤俭办社、勤俭持家，首先把更多的人力物力财力用在发展生产上。这样，生活的改善就有了更牢靠的基础。
                                                （完）
