　　Prevent Drought and Conserve Soil Moisture to Benefit Autumn Planting
　　This autumn, many regions in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins have suffered from varying degrees of drought. This is not conducive to the growth of late autumn crops and also creates difficulties for this year's autumn planting.

　　Many regions with autumn planting tasks have experienced such difficulties. Taking Henan Province's situation last year as an example, it took several times the usual effort to complete just over 80% of the total wheat planting task by October 20th. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River also had similar situations last year. In many areas of Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, rapeseed simply could not be sown due to drought, seriously hindering the completion of the sowing task. Autumn drought also affects the quality of autumn planting. Wheat sown in Henan, Shandong, and other provinces through drought resistance measures generally showed seedling shortages. In Lingbao County, Henan, wheat fields with 20%-25% seedling shortages accounted for one-tenth of the total wheat fields.

　　These situations tell us that for this year's autumn planting, drought prevention is still a very important matter and a key to whether or not the autumn planting task can be completed.

　　Farmers in the provinces of the Yellow River basin have rich experience in preventing and resisting drought; farmers in some drought-prone areas of the Yangtze River basin have also continuously fought against autumn droughts. Agricultural cooperatives in these regions should immediately summarize the experience of the local masses in this regard, formulate drought prevention and resistance measures based on the specific situation in their areas this year, and take active action.

　　From the situation in most areas, a lack of fertilizer and insufficient draft animals are also quite common phenomena. Regions with autumn planting tasks should also make every effort to prepare fertilizer and draft animals for autumn planting.

　　Most areas are currently about twenty days away from autumn planting. If we can seize this time and put in a certain amount of effort, we will surely be able to do a good job in this year's autumn planting.

### 防旱保墒以利秋播

　　防旱保墒以利秋播
    今年秋季，黄河流域和长江流域的许多地区，都遭到不同程度的干旱。既不利于晚秋作物的生长，也给今年的秋种带来困难。
    不少有秋种任务的地区，都经历过这种困难。以河南省去年的情况来说，花了几倍于常年的力气，到10月20日才完成种麦总任务的80％多。长江流域的中、下游，去年也有类似的情况，江西、安徽、湖北等省的不少地区的油菜硬是因干旱不能下种，严重妨碍播种任务的完成。秋旱并且会影响秋种的质量。河南、山东等省抗旱播种的小麦，普遍有缺苗的现象。河南灵宝县缺苗20％—25％的麦田，占总麦田的十分之一。
    这些情况告诉我们：对今年的秋种来说，防旱仍是一件很重要的事情，是能不能完成秋种任务的一个关键。
    黄河流域各省的农民有丰富的防旱、抗旱经验；长江流域一些容易发生干旱的地区的农民，也不断和秋旱作过斗争。这些地区的农业社，应该立即总结当地群众在这一方面的经验，从当地今年的具体情况出发，定出防旱、抗旱措施，积极行动起来。
    从多数地区的情况来看，缺乏肥料、耕畜不足也是相当普遍的现象。有秋种任务的地区，还要尽力为秋种准备肥料和耕畜。
    大部地区目前距秋种还有二十天左右，如果能抓紧这段时间，付出一定的力量，一定能把今年的秋种工作做好。
