Xinhua News Agency, September 19th – The rectification movement in the Beijing financial and trade system has been fully launched. According to preliminary statistics from forty company-level units, since late August, workers have submitted over 80,000 suggestions and posted 8,200 big-character posters.

Over half of the suggestions target business management and leadership style. Some workers at the Cultural Supplies Company pointed out that the company's organization of goods supply was inconsistent and unable to properly arrange production. For example, during the anti-waste campaign in 1955, the company leadership did not investigate the market situation and drastically reduced purchases, leading to a shortage of goods in 1956. As a result, last year they engaged in a rush to purchase and expand processing, causing factories to add equipment and personnel. This year, with the market trending towards relaxation, the company is again reducing purchases, which has greatly impacted factory production. Workers at the Sugar and Pastry Company drew many cartoons criticizing leading cadres for not going to the grassroots level. Workers at the Cultural Supplies Company posted over thirty big-character posters and cartoons targeting the Secretary Director, Fan Li, criticizing her for "having been with the company for a year and a half, but always talking about being unfamiliar with the business at meetings."

Leading cadres of various companies analyzed and studied the suggestions made by the workers, and immediately made changes wherever possible. For example, the People's Bank, based on workers' suggestions, changed the business hours of various savings offices, making them more convenient for the masses. The Textile Company, based on workers' suggestions, stopped promoting light-colored fabrics and supplied customers with dark-colored fabrics in a timely manner. The Oils and Fats Company eliminated the overlapping laboratory with various oil factories and distributed all the personnel and equipment of the company laboratory to the oil factories, enriching the lower levels. The municipal commercial work authorities believe that the opinions put forward by the workers in the course of extensive airing of views on all aspects of commercial work are of great significance for promoting and improving the work, and require the leading cadres of all units to continue to improve their work with the greatest determination, seize the time to improve their work, and seriously treat every opinion put forward by the workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 19th – Over 150 commercial enterprise units in Tianjin have successively launched rectification movements since September. Nearly 30,000 workers in these units have launched an upsurge of airing views, and to date, over 110,000 criticisms and suggestions have been put forward.

Workers in various units are airing their views in various ways, and the most widely used and active method is big-character posters. According to preliminary statistics, these units have posted over 18,000 big-character posters. On the colorful big-character posters, there are short essays, clapper talks, cross-talks, as well as short plays and cartoons. In this active democratic atmosphere, many people who rarely gave opinions to Party organizations and leaders in the past have also begun to express their opinions freely. For example, in eleven units in the Heping District, over 90% of the workers have offered suggestions. On the evening of the day the mobilization meeting was held at the Sugar and Fruit Company, workers posted 144 big-character posters.

The scope of the opinions put forward by the workers is very wide, including leadership style, Party-masses relations, and business management. For example, Ji Facheng, a cadre at the Heping Road Department Store, pointed out that some leading cadres and ordinary workers often "get the moon first because they are near the water" when it comes to goods that are in short supply. He criticized Liu Zhiming, the deputy manager of the department store, saying that others queued to buy cotton, but Liu Zhiming not only didn't queue but also asked the counter chief to get him four catties first, and the transaction was made in the section chief's office. Liu Zongchang of the Cultural Supplies Purchasing Station questioned the leading cadres in charge of warehousing, saying: "Knowing that the goods are moldy and deteriorated, you still ship them out. May I ask: If they cannot be sold in other places, what are your opinions? Do you only care that the goods are not short in the warehouse and everything is fine?" These opinions put forward by the workers have been valued by Party and administrative leaders. Most units have established improvement groups to promptly study and sort out everyone's opinions. For problems that can be solved immediately, measures are being taken to resolve them.

While airing their views extensively, most of these units are paying attention to ensuring the normal operation of daily business. Many business personnel of the Municipal Coal and Building Materials Company are actively airing their views and going deep into the retail outlets in the eight districts of the city to check the situation of goods purchase, coal briquette production, and coal transportation, and actively discovering problems and solving them in a timely manner. The cadres in charge of rectification and business leadership of the Municipal Department Store have made specific divisions of labor and established a system of regular meetings to study together so that rectification and business are closely integrated.

    京津财贸系统全面整风
    职工们广泛运用大字报提出批评建议
    领导干部分析研究后能改的马上就改
    新华社19日讯　北京财经贸易系统整风运动已经全面展开。据四十个公司一级单位的初步统计，8月下旬以来职工们已经提出八万多条意见，贴出了八千二百多张大字报。
    意见中，有半数以上是针对经营管理和领导作风而提的。文化用品公司有的职工提出，公司组织货源摇摆不定，不能正确安排生产。如1955年开展反浪费运动时，公司领导上不调查研究市场情况，大力压缩进货，造成1956年商品供不应求；于是在去年又进行突击进货，扩大加工，使工厂增添设备和人员。今年市场趋向缓和，公司又压缩进货，这样对工厂的生产影响很大。糖业糕点公司职工画了不少漫画，批评领导干部不下基层。文化用品公司职工给秘书主任范黎贴了三十多张大字报和漫画，批评她“来公司一年半了，开会总是谈业务不熟悉。”
    各公司领导干部对职工提出的意见进行了分析研究，凡是能够立即可以改进的，马上就改进。例如，人民银行根据职工的意见，改变了各储蓄所的营业时间，便利了群众。纺织品公司根据职工意见，停止推销浅色布，适时以深色布供应顾客。油脂公司把与各油厂重叠的化验室取消了，将公司化验室的全部人员和器材分配给各油厂，充实了下层。市商业工作主管部门认为，职工们在大鸣大放中就商业工作各方面所提的意见，对于推动和改进工作有重大意义，要求各单位领导干部必须继续以最大的决心，抓紧时间改进工作，认真严肃地对待职工提出的每一项意见。
    新华社天津19日电　天津市一百五十多个商业企业单位9月份以来陆续展开整风运动。这些单位的近三万名职工已经掀起鸣放热潮，到目前为止提出的批评和建议已经有十一万多件。
    各单位职工运用各种方式大鸣大放，而运用得最广泛、显得最活跃的是大字报。据初步统计，这些单位已经张贴出大字报一万八千多张。在五光十色的大字报上，有短文、快板、相声，还有短剧、漫画。在这种活跃的民主气氛中，许多从来很少给党组织和领导人员提意见的人，也开始畅抒己见。如和平区的十一个单位里，90％以上的职工都提了意见。糖业果品公司开完动员会的当天晚上，职工们就贴出了一百四十四张大字报。
    职工们提出的意见范围非常广泛，包括领导作风、党群关系、经营管理等方面。如和平路百货商店的干部吉发澄提出：有些领导干部和一般职工对一些供应不足的商品经常是“近水楼台先得月”。他批评百货公司副经理刘志明说，别人买棉花排队，刘志明不但不排队，还叫柜长先给他拿四斤，在科长室成交。文化用品采购站刘宗昌对仓储方面的领导干部提出质问说：“知道商品霉坏变质，还往外发货，请问：外地销不了，你们有何看法？你们只管商品在库内不短不少就万事大吉吗？”职工们提出的这些意见，受到了党和行政领导人员的重视。绝大部分单位都已建立了改进小组，及时研究、整理大家的意见。对于能够立即采取措施加以解决的问题，都在陆续着手解决。
    这些单位在大鸣大放的同时，大部分都注意保证日常业务工作的正常进行。市煤业建筑器材公司的许多业务人员一面积极鸣放，一面深入到市内八个区的各零售门市部，检查进货、煤球生产及煤的运输等情况，主动发现问题及时解决。市百货公司领导整风和领导业务的干部都作了具体分工，而且建立了定时碰头研究的制度，以使整风、业务密切结合。
