Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 6th: Thousands of working people in Budapest gathered at the sports stadium on the afternoon of September 4th to protest the United Nations "Five-Person Committee" report and the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Hungarian question."

At the meeting, Gyula Atutai, Vice Chairman of the Hungarian National Peace Council and President of Eötvös Loránd University, said that the people of Budapest, together with the people of Hungary, resolutely reject the "Five-Person Committee" report, which unreasonably interferes in Hungary's internal affairs. We oppose this report in order to safeguard the dignity and future tranquility of our people, and for the cause of world peace.

He said that today, university youth, general youth, and progressive intellectuals share the same view of the October events as the people of the whole country, and there are many who can testify to the United Nations. The United Nations has already listened to the words of one hundred and eleven refugees, so please listen to the words of ten million young people as well.

A joint statement signed by one hundred and seventy-one writers was read at the meeting. The statement protested against the United Nations "Five-Person Committee" report and the UN General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Hungarian question."

Staff members from the Kossuth Radio Station, the National Museum, the Historical Museum, the Natural Science Museum, and other units, who experienced the October events, also refuted the absurd report of the "Five-Person Committee" based on what they witnessed at the time.

    布达佩斯劳动人民集会
    抗议联大讨论“匈牙利问题”
    新华社布达佩斯6日电　布达佩斯数千劳动群众9月4日下午在体育馆集会，抗议联合国“五人委员会”报告和联合国大会讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”。
    匈牙利全国和平理事会副主席、厄特佛什·洛兰德大学校长阿图泰·久洛在会上说，布达佩斯人民和匈牙利全国人民一起坚决拒绝无理干涉匈牙利内政的“五人委员会”的报告。我们反对这个报告是为了维护我国人民的尊严和将来的安宁，是为了世界和平事业。
    他说，今天大学青年和一般青年以及进步知识分子对十月事件的看法是和全国人民一致的，可以为联合国作证人的人是很多的。联合国已经听取了一百十一个逃亡者的话，那么也请听听千万个青年的话吧。
    会上宣读了由一百七十一个作家签名的联合声明。声明就联合国“五人委员会”的报告和联大将讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”提出了抗议。
    十月事件的经历者——科苏特广播电台、民族博物馆、历史博物馆、自然科学博物馆等的工作人员也以当时目击的情形，驳斥了“五人委员会”的荒谬报告。
