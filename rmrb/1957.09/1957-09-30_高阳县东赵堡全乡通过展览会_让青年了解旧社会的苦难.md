Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, September 28th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Dejian) reports: The "Comparison of New and Old Society Life and Objects Exhibition" held in Dongzhaobao Township, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, has greatly educated the youth in the township and further strengthened their determination to follow the socialist road.

Most of the 298 young people in Dongzhaobao Township have not personally experienced the suffering of the old society and do not deeply appreciate the happy life of today. Therefore, the township's Party general branch and the Communist Youth League committee decided to hold a "Comparison of New and Old Society Life and Objects Exhibition" to educate the young people.

The exhibition was held in two rooms, displaying thirty-four kinds of substitute foods that people in Dongzhaobao Township ate after the 1939 flood, such as sorghum husk mixed with elm bark flour steamed buns, wheat seedling cakes, corn cob vegetable dumplings, and bran cakes; as well as worn-out coarse cloth cotton clothes and tattered cotton quilts; at the same time, it also displayed rice, white flour, corn, and potatoes that people still ate even though they had suffered from disasters for three consecutive years since 1954, newly purchased radios, rain boots, flashlights, and new clothes and new quilts. In addition, some picture stories and statistical charts drawn based on investigations and recollections of older people were also posted. From two charts, it can be seen that out of more than 600 households in the township, 133 people starved to death in a short period after the 1939 flood, 263 households went out to beg for food, and 73 households abandoned their wives and sold their children. However, although the disasters have been more severe in the past three years than in 1939, due to the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the government has transferred more than two million jin of grain from other provinces and cities, and every household has no worries about food; not only has no household in the township gone out to beg for food, but also because of government relief and loan support, sideline production has been developed; in the past three years, the township has also newly purchased 64 radios, 215 flashlights, 350 thermos bottles, and 825 pairs of rain boots, and every household has added new clothes and new bedding.

This exhibition left a very deep impression on the youth. When young Zhao Dachuan saw the picture depicting his father's situation of begging for food and starving to death in a dilapidated temple after the 1939 disaster, he burst into tears on the spot, and many young people followed suit. After the visit, the young people examined their mistaken ideas of only thinking about themselves and disregarding the interests of the country.

    高阳县东赵堡全乡通过展览会
    让青年了解旧社会的苦难
    据新华社保定28日电　新华社记者汪德鉴报道：河北省高阳县东赵堡乡举办的“新旧社会生活对比实物展览会”，使乡里青年受到很大教育，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。
    东赵堡乡的二百九十八名青年，大部分都没有亲身经历过旧社会的苦难，对今天的幸福生活体验不深。于是乡里党总支和团委会决定举办一次“新旧社会生活对比实物展览会”，对青年们进行教育。
    展览会设在两个屋子里，展出了东赵堡乡1939年遭受水灾后人们吃过的高粱帽（壳）拌榆皮面蒸的窝窝头、麦苗饼子、玉米棒制成的菜团子和谷糠饼等三十四种代食品，穿用过的粗布破棉衣、破棉被等；同时展出了1954年以来虽然连续三年受灾人们仍吃的大米、白面、玉米、马铃薯，新买的收音机、雨鞋、手电筒和新衣、新被等。另外，还张贴了一些根据调查和老年人们回忆叙述的事实而绘制成的连环画和统计图表。从两幅图表上可以看到：全乡六百多户人家，1939年水灾后，很短期间就饿死了一百三十三人，有二百六十三户出外逃荒求乞，有七十三户抛妻子、卖儿女。而近三年虽然连年遭灾，灾情超过了1939年，可是由于实行了粮食统购统销政策，政府从其他省、市调来了二百多万斤粮食，家家户户不愁吃；全乡不但没有一户出外逃荒，而且因为政府的救济和贷款扶持，搞起了副业生产；三年中，全乡还新买了六十四部收音机、二百一十五个手电筒、三百五十个热水瓶、八百二十五双雨鞋，家家户户都添置了新衣服、新被褥。
    这次展览会在青年中留下了很深刻的印象。青年赵大船在看到图画里画的他父亲1939年受灾后出外讨饭饿死在破庙里的情形时，当场泣不成声，许多青年也跟着哭起来。青年们在参观后检讨了自己只为个人打算，不顾国家利益的错误思想。
