    Chen Duanbing Firmly Stands on Patriotic Stance

    Chen Duanbing, the 57-year-old deputy chief engineer of the Xi'an Electric Power Design Institute, is a Christian and a patriot. He has always been enthusiastic about the country's peaceful construction and actively participated in various political movements. At the beginning of this rectification movement, with good intentions, he offered many suggestions to the Party. However, he initially regarded the malicious attacks on the Communist Party by certain right-wing elements as mere grievances of talented individuals who felt unappreciated. When the anti-rightist struggle began, he advocated for a peaceful resolution based on the spirit of forgiveness of Jesus. He felt that the word "struggle" was too provocative. However, as the movement deepened and the conspiratorial activities of many right-wing elements were exposed, he suddenly realized that these right-wing elements were attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, undermine socialist construction, and restore capitalism in China. This reminded him of his life before liberation, when he worked as a slave for the imperialists at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. He angrily said, "Without the Communist Party, I wouldn't have the free life I have today. Anyone who tries to overthrow the Communist Party, I will fight them to the death!" Since then, he has actively participated in meetings to criticize right-wing elements and has confronted them directly.

    At one meeting, the right-wing element An Zhongyi fabricated rumors, saying, "Only Party member cadres have a say in the design institute; non-Party cadres' opinions don't count." At that time, Chen Duanbing stood up and retorted, "Who says non-Party cadres' opinions don't count? I am a non-Party cadre, and the Party committee has always valued my opinions on work. How can you say they don't count?" Another right-wing element slandered that China's rule of law was not as good as British and American democracy. Chen Duanbing used his experience studying in the United States to expose this nonsense. He said, "When I was in the United States, I saw some Chinese people arrested on suspicion of being 'thieves' simply for walking near American stores. Some Chinese students were also often detained by the American authorities for no reason. Is this kind of violation of human rights considered democracy?!" He was even more angry when talking about British rule of law. He said, "The British ruling class has no rule of law at all. They created the 'May 30th' massacre in China and arbitrarily shot Chinese people. We personally witnessed our compatriots falling in pools of blood under the enemy's bayonets. How dare you praise British rule of law? It's shameless!"

    For more than three months, Chen Duanbing has insisted on attending many meetings to criticize right-wing elements. He said, "Through this movement, I have realized that a patriotic stance is the stance of the working class, which is also the Party's stance. If our stance is not aligned with the Party, then so-called patriotism is just empty talk." (Xinhua News Agency)

    陈端柄站稳爱国立场
    西安电力设计分院的五十七岁的副总工程师陈端柄，是个基督教徒，一个爱国主义者。他一向热心于祖国的和平建设事业，并积极地参加各项政治运动。在这次整风运动开始，他抱着善良的动机，给党提出了不少意见。但是，他开始时也把某些右派分子向共产党恶意攻击的阴谋，看成是这些人怀才不遇，向党发牢骚。反右派斗争开始时，他主张按照耶稣的宽恕精神，和平地解决问题。他认为“斗争”这个字眼，太刺激了。可是随着运动的深入开展，许多右派分子的阴谋活动被揭露出来以后，他才恍然大悟，原来这些右派分子都是企图推翻共产党的领导，破坏社会主义建设，使资本主义在中国复辟。这使他回想起解放前，他在上海电力公司给帝国主义者作奴隶时的生活。他气愤地说：“没有共产党就没有我今天的自由生活，谁要推翻共产党，我就和谁拼！”此后，他就积极地参加批判右派分子的会议，并且和右派分子面对面地斗争。
    在一次会议上，右派分子安忠义造谣说：“设计院只有党员干部说话算数，非党干部说的话就不算数。”当时，陈端柄就站起来驳斥：“谁说非党干部说话不算数？我是个非党干部，我对工作所提的意见，党委一向很重视，怎么能说不算数呢？”另一个右派分子诬蔑我国的法治不如英、美民主，陈端柄就以他在美国留学时的体验，戳穿了这种胡说。他说：“我在美国时，曾看见一些中国人因在美国商店附近散步，就被以‘盗窃犯’嫌疑抓去了。有些中国留学生也常常毫无缘故地被美国当局关起来。难道这种侵犯人权的行为也算民主吗！”提起英国的法治他更气愤，他说：“英国的统治阶级根本就没有什么法治，他们在中国制造过‘五卅’惨案，任意枪杀中国人，我们曾亲眼看见自己的同胞在敌人的刺刀下倒在血泊中，你竟然有脸称赞英国的法治，真是无耻！”
    三个多月来，陈端柄坚持参加了许多次批判右派分子的会议。他说：“通过这次运动，使我认识到爱国立场就是工人阶级的立场，也就是党的立场。如果我们的立场还没有和党站在一起，那末所谓爱国就只是一句空话。”（据新华社讯）
