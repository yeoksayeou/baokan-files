　　Some Questions on the History of Eastern Philosophy

　　The fourth issue of "Philosophical Research" published a report by M.T. Iovchuk, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, at the academic conference of the Soviet Institute of Philosophy on February 28th this year. In this report, the author summarized the research, writing, and editing of the history of Eastern philosophy in Soviet philosophical circles, and expounded some basic principles of the Marxist historical view of philosophy. The experience of Soviet philosophical circles in the study of the history of philosophy provided by Comrade Iovchuk in his report is obviously of great reference value to Chinese historians of philosophy, especially the emphasis on issues in the history of Chinese philosophy.

　　The author pointed out in the report that the reason why some of their past works on the history of philosophy underestimated the value of the history of Eastern philosophy was mainly due to the remaining "Eurocentrism", or rather, "Western centrism," in practice. This harmful and one-sided view had long been criticized in the Soviet Union. This view holds that the development of philosophical thought seems to have started from ancient Greece and Rome, and that only Western European countries are the main and almost the only base for the development of philosophical thought, while the East seems to have played no major role in the development of philosophical thought, at most being a center of religious and ethical doctrines.

　　In the first and second volumes of the World History of Philosophy, edited and published under the auspices of the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, this shortcoming has been changed. The authors and editors of the book, based on the Marxist viewpoint, summarized and clearly expressed the position of the philosophical thought of Egypt and other Arab countries, China, India, Iran, and other Eastern nations in the entire history of philosophy.

　　This history of philosophy takes completely different Marxist principles in elucidating Eastern philosophy compared with many idealistic works in the past and present, as well as some philosophical history books previously published in Russia. They closely linked the periodization of the history of philosophical thought, the basic causes of the origin and change of philosophical systems, and the internal laws of the development of philosophical thought with the social relations and the development of class struggle in history; the development of philosophical thought was examined through the mutual struggle between materialism and idealism. Here, the author particularly cited the handling of the history of Indian philosophy as an example. The author also pointed out the historical fact that the representatives of some advanced philosophical doctrines often stood in the field of religious thought to oppose the dominant religious thought, and that the materialist doctrines of the feudal era tended to be idealistic under the pressure of the dominant religious thought.

　　The authors and editors of the history of philosophy abandoned the one-sided and erroneous view of idealistic historians of philosophy who have described the philosophy of China, India, and other Eastern countries as religious intuition, stagnation, without internal contradictions and development in the past and present, and strived to restore the true historical facts, showing that as early as ancient times, especially in the feudal era, thinkers in Eastern countries had deeply and uniquely, and often correctly for the time, solved problems in ontology, epistemology, and logic in their philosophical doctrines; in terms of social doctrines, they also expressed meaningful ideas. In their writing, the authors not only estimated the historical development characteristics reflected by each nation through its philosophical and socio-political thought, but also tried their best to reveal the international connections of the philosophical thought of various nations, although this aspect remains to be further studied.

　　Comrade Iovchuk spent more space in his report elaborating on the research, writing, and some views on the part of the history of Chinese philosophy completed with the cooperation of Chinese scholars. He said that if Confucius's doctrine is regarded as a completely reactionary doctrine, it is a simplification of the problem. The transformation of Confucius's doctrine into a reactionary religious and ethical doctrine occurred later. He also supported the view that the characteristics of Chinese materialism in the tenth to seventeenth centuries were the connection of theory with practice, based on natural science, and opposition to religion; the Chinese materialism of this period was in many ways different in content from the previous ancient materialism, and even less could it be equated with ancient primitive and simple materialism, but it was still not the new metaphysical materialism based on mechanical natural science that emerged in Western Europe around the seventeenth century. The author pointed out that the worldview in the "Tao Te Ching" is estimated more correctly in this history of philosophy than before. He said that it would be an exaggeration to say that the "Tao Te Ching" is completely materialistic, but in terms of its philosophical content, it cannot be said to be a view of objective idealism. The "Tao Te Ching" contains a critique of religious ideas, recognizes the existence of objective laws, and is especially full of ideas about the spontaneous dialectics of the world.

　　The author also raised some hopes in the report, saying that he hoped that the progressive socio-political ideas, anti-feudal and national liberation desires, and why they often took religious forms in Eastern countries, etc., could be revealed in the latter two volumes of the history of philosophy. The author also emphasized that the history of the development of Marxist-Leninist philosophical thought in Eastern countries, its struggle against anti-Marxist philosophical and sociological doctrines, and the process of the development of scientific philosophical thought in Eastern countries should be studied in the fourth volume.

### 关于东方哲学史的一些问题

　　关于东方哲学史的一些问题
    “哲学研究”第四期刊载了苏联科学院通讯院士M·T·约夫楚克同志在今年2月28日的苏联哲学研究所学术会议上的一篇报告。作者在这篇报告中综述了苏联哲学界关于东方哲学史的研究、撰写和编辑的情况，申述了马克思主义哲学史观的一些基本原则。约夫楚克同志在报告中提供出来的苏联哲学界关于哲学史研究工作的经验，对于我国哲学史工作者显然具有很大的参考价值，特别是其中着重地谈到了关于中国哲学史上的问题。
    作者在报告中指出，他们过去的一些哲学史著作所以低估了东方哲学史的价值，主要是由于在实践上还残存着“欧洲中心论”的观点，确切地说是“西方中心论”的观点。这种有害的片面观点，在苏联是早就被批判了的。这种观点认为：哲学思想的发展似乎是从古代希腊和罗马开始的，而且好像只有西欧国家才是哲学思想发展的主要并且几乎是唯一的基地，至于东方，似乎在哲学思想发展中没有起过什么大的作用，最多只是宗教伦理学说的中心罢了。
    在苏联科学院哲学研究所主持撰写并已出版的世界哲学史的第一、二两卷中，已改变了这个缺点。该书的作者和编者依据马克思主义的观点概括而明确地表达了埃及和阿拉伯其他国家，中国、印度、伊朗，以及东方其他各民族的哲学思想在全部哲学史上的地位。
    这部哲学史在阐明东方哲学时跟过去和目下的许多唯心主义的著作，以及和先前俄国出版的一些哲学史书籍比较，是采取了完全不同的马克思主义的原则从事的。他们将哲学思想史的分期，哲学体系起源和变更的基本原因，以及哲学思想发展的内部规律，同历史中的社会关系、阶级斗争的发展密切地联系了起来；对于哲学思想的发展是通过唯物主义同唯心主义相互斗争来考察的。在这里，作者特别以对印度哲学史的处理作为例证。作者还指出，在反对占统治地位的宗教思想时，一些先进的哲学学说的代表人物，往往是站在宗教思想领域中来反对的史实，以及封建时代唯物主义学说在占统治地位的宗教思想的压力之下具有唯心主义的倾向等。
    哲学史的作者和编者，抛弃了唯心主义哲学史家过去和现在都把中国、印度及东方其他国家的哲学，描述成宗教直观的、停滞的、没有内部矛盾和发展的片面的错误的观点，而力图恢复历史的真情实况，表明早在古代，特别是封建时代，东方国家的思想家们，在自己的哲学学说中，已深刻地、独特地，就当时来说常常是正确地解决了本体论、认识论、逻辑学上的问题；在社会学说方面，也发表过有意义的思想。作者们在写作中除估计了每个民族通过其哲学和社会政治思想反映出来的历史发展特点外，并竭力揭示了各民族哲学思想的国际联系，虽然这方面还待于进一步的研究。
    约夫楚克同志在他的报告中用了比较多的篇幅阐明了在中国学者合作下完成的关于中国哲学史部分的研究、写作情况和一些看法。他说，假如把孔子学说看作是一种全盘反动的学说，是把问题简单化了，孔子学说之变为反动的宗教伦理学说，乃是在后来发生的。他并支持了这样的看法：第十—十七世纪中国唯物主义的特点是理论联系实践，以自然科学为依据，反对宗教；这时期的中国唯物主义就其内容来说在许多方面都不同于先前的古代唯物主义，更不能与古代的原始朴素唯物主义等同，但是，也还不就是十七世纪左右西欧产生的那种以机械自然科学为依据的新的、形而上学的唯物主义。作者指出，在这部哲学史中对于“道德经”中的世界观的估价比以前作得更正确了。他说，如果把“道德经”说成是完全唯物主义的，那会是过分的夸大，但按其哲学内容来说也不能说是客观唯心主义的观点。“道德经”是包含了对宗教观念的批判、承认客观规律存在的思想，还特别充满了关于世界的自发辩证法的观点。
    作者在报告中还提出了一些希望，他说，希望在后两卷哲学史中能够揭示进步的社会政治思想、反封建的和民族解放的欲望，为什么在东方各国里常常采取宗教的形式，等等。作者并强调在第四卷中应当研究马克思列宁主义哲学思想在东方各国发展的历史，及其反对反马克思主义的哲学学说和社会学学说的斗争，科学的哲学思想在东方各国开展的过程。　（期蕃）
