Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Beijing Labor Cadre School, after more than a month of struggle, exposed and criticized the systematic and programmatic anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Chen Da, the vice-principal, “sociologist,” and rightist element.

　　Chen Da conducted the most vicious and systematic slander and curses against the Communist Party. He said, "The Communist Party would be better off not using the word 'Party'. In my mind, I resist the name 'Party'… If the name 'Party' is not used, it would be better to change it to 'League'. A league means like-minded people, and league members are like-minded members. This is closer to the Communist Party members calling each other 'comrade', and closer to the lofty ideals of serving the people and transforming the world." The masses pointed out in big-character posters that Chen Da said he had a resistant thought towards the name "Party," which is actually opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, and even wanting to abolish the Communist Party. The masses revealed the following facts to prove this point. Chen Da said, "The CCP has very good methods for leading the revolution, but I don't think it can lead scientific work." He also said, "Some Party members don't understand the work they lead, but they still want to lead it. Many problems arise from here."

　　Chen Da also falsely accused the Party leadership of the Ministry of Labor and those being led, saying: "The leadership in the Ministry is layered, and each layer is responsible by Party members. This kind of leadership is like playing chess. The people being led are like chess pieces. They move when the Party members tell them to, and they don't move when the Party members don't say anything. If the chess player makes a mistake, others follow suit. This kind of leadership will not have good results for work or for improving cadres."

　　Chen Da deliberately misinterpreted the phrase "Communist Party members are made of special materials" to mean that Communist Party members consider themselves superior. He compared Communist Party members to imperialist elements, to "white people who think they are superior," and to "Christians who think they are commissioned by God." He cursed that the Communist Party would, like these people, "decline and eventually go to ruin due to thinking they are special."

　　After Chen Da viciously cursed the Communist Party and negated the role of the Party, he turned around to ridicule and slander the working class and the broad masses under the leadership of the Communist Party. He said, how can the proletariat, which has no knowledge, be called the advanced class? He also undermined the Party's mass line, saying: "In the liberated areas before, there were fewer specialized problems, and three cobblers could beat one Zhuge Liang; now it's different, we need to ask Zhuge Liang for help more and more. Zhuge Liang should be respected more and more," "Today, three thousand cobblers can't beat one Zhuge Liang," "For the solution of technical problems, specialized knowledge is needed. Cobblers are useless, Zhuge Liang must solve it."

　　According to the rightist element Chen Da's statement, the Communist Party cannot lead science, the Party's leading cadres and the masses are all cobblers, and the proletariat has no knowledge, then we can only ask "Zhuge Liang" like Chen Da, who was educated by imperialism, to take the stage.

### 阴谋取消共产党的领导  陈达制造了系统的反共谬论

　　阴谋取消共产党的领导
　　陈达制造了系统的反共谬论
    据新华社讯　北京劳动干部学校经过一个多月来的斗争，揭露和批判了副校长、“社会学家”、右派分子陈达的有系统的、纲领性的反共反社会主义言行。
    陈达对共产党进行了最恶毒地、有系统地污蔑和咒骂。他说：“共产党最好不用‘党’这个字。在我的思想上对‘党’这个名称是有抗拒的……如果不用‘党’这个名称，改用‘盟’，会更好些，盟是志同道合的意思，盟员即是志同道合的成员。这与共产党员称‘同志’要接近些，与为人民服务和改造世界的崇高理想要接近些。”群众在大字报上指出，陈达说对“党”这个名称有抗拒思想，实际上是反对共产党的领导，甚至要取消共产党。群众揭露出下列事实来论证这一点。陈达说过，“中共领导革命很有办法，而对科学工作，我认为还不能领导”。他又说：“有些党员对他领导的工作不懂，却又要他来领导，许多问题都是从这里发生的。”
    陈达又诬蔑劳动部党的领导和被领导者说：“部里的领导分层，每层都要党员负责。这种领导仿佛是下棋的方式。被领导的人好像是棋子，党员说一下，他们动一下，党员不说，他们也不动。下棋的错了，别人也跟着错了。这种领导方式对于工作对于提高干部不会有很好的效果的。”
    陈达故意把“共产党员是特殊材料制成的”这句话曲解为共产党员自命高人一等的意思。他把共产党员比拟为帝国主义分子，比拟为“自以为高尚的白种人”，比拟为“自以为奉上帝之命的基督徒”，他诅咒共产党将要和这些人一样“由于自以为特殊而衰败，以至走向末路”。
    陈达在毒骂了共产党、否定了党的作用以后，再回过头来嘲笑、污蔑工人阶级和在共产党领导下的广大群众。他说，无产阶级无知识，怎能称先进阶级？他又破坏党的群众路线说：“以前在解放区里专门性的问题少，可用三个臭皮匠去顶一个诸葛亮；现在不同了，我们要请求诸葛亮的地方越来越多了。诸葛亮是应该越发受到尊重”“今天的臭皮匠三千个也顶不上一个诸葛亮”，“对于技术问题的解决，需要有专门的知识，臭皮匠不成了，必须要诸葛亮才能解决”。
    按照右派分子陈达的说法，共产党不能领导科学，党的领导干部和群众都是臭皮匠，无产阶级又没有知识，那末，只好请陈达那样的由帝国主义教养出来的“诸葛亮”上台了。
