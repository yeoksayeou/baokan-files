Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: China's first planetarium, the Beijing Planetarium, officially opened today. More than six hundred prominent figures from Beijing took an interesting "journey through the universe" in the planetarium today. In the main building of the planetarium, the Celestial Theater, people saw a complex and sophisticated planetarium projector. It projects various astronomical phenomena onto the dome-shaped roof screen, creating a realistic "artificial starry sky."

    Each motor on this planetarium projector can move forward or backward. Therefore, it can "predict" astronomical phenomena thousands of years in the future and reenact past astronomical phenomena.

    In addition to the Celestial Theater, the planetarium also has an exhibition hall, a lecture hall, a small observatory, and a small weather station. These places display rarely seen astronomical meteorites, astronomical instruments, and meteorological instrument artifacts and models.

    The Beijing Planetarium began construction in the autumn of 1955 and was built with the help of experts from the German Democratic Republic. Chen Zungui, the curator of the Beijing Planetarium, told reporters that this planetarium could rival the best of the world's twenty planetariums. Its tasks are to help train astronomy cadres, publish popular astronomy books and periodicals, collect astronomical historical materials and meteorites, and trial-produce small planetarium projectors to supply the whole country, etc.

    Those who attended today's opening ceremony included Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Lu Dingyi, famous astronomer Cheng Maolan, and scientist Gao Shiqi, among more than six hundred people. Liang Xi, Chairman of the National Association for the Dissemination of Scientific and Technological Knowledge, Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Ackermann, Commercial Counselor of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting.

    北京天文馆昨日开幕
    陈毅、陆定一等六百多人参加了开幕式
    据新华社29日讯　我国第一座天文馆——北京天文馆，今天正式开幕。北京六百多个著名人士今天在这个馆作了一次有趣的“宇宙旅行”。人们在馆内的主要建筑天象厅里，看到一架复杂精巧的天象仪。它把各种天文现象放映到穹形的屋顶银幕上，构成一幅逼真的“人造星空”。
    这架天象仪上的每个电动机都能前进或是倒退。因此，它能“预算”千百年后的天象，也能重演过去的天象。
    天文馆除了天象厅外，还有展览厅、讲演厅、小天文台和小气象台，这些地方陈列着很少见到的天文陨石、天文仪器、气象仪器的实物和模型。
    北京天文馆在1955年秋天动工兴建，它是在德意志民主共和国专家帮助下建成的。北京天文馆馆长陈遵妫告诉记者，这座天文馆能和世界上二十座天文馆中最好的并驾齐驱。它的任务是：帮助培养天文学干部，出版通俗的天文学图书和刊物，收藏天文学史料和陨石，试制小天象仪供应全国各地等等。
    参加今天开幕典礼的有国务院副总理陈毅、中共中央宣传部部长陆定一、著名天文学家程茂兰和科学家高士其等六百多人。全国科学技术普及学会主席梁希、北京市副市长吴晗和德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆商务专员阿克曼等都在会上致了祝词。
