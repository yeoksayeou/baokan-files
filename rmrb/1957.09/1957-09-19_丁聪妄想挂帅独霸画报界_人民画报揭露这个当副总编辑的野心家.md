Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Ding Cong (member of the China Democratic League), deputy editor-in-chief of "People's Pictorial," colluded with another deputy editor-in-chief, Hu Kao, and editors Shen Baichang and Zhou Shaochang, etc., in a conspiracy to usurp "People's Pictorial" and dominate China's pictorial world. This plot has been exposed and criticized at recent consecutive criticism meetings held by the "People's Pictorial" editorial department. According to revelations, their steps were: first, to usurp "People's Pictorial," and then to dominate China's pictorial world. If this plan failed, they intended to publish two versions of "People's Pictorial," create division, drive out all the Party members from the current "People's Pictorial," and publish another pictorial, controlled by Ding Cong and his small clique to transform the existing "People's Pictorial," changing its nature and selling it exclusively to capitalist countries. If that didn't work, they would specialize in "club publications" and compete with pictorials led by the Communist Party. The "club publication" that Ding Cong participated in preparing planned to have a special column for publishing rejected manuscripts that other pictorials and magazines didn't use, and would also publish the editorial department's rejection letters. They also planned to distribute it abroad. They discussed that no matter where this publication was published, the Communist Party would not be allowed to "interfere in internal affairs." When they thought their attack was about to succeed, Ding Cong arrogantly considered himself the embodiment of the Chinese pictorial tradition and actively prepared to "take command and appear on stage." Under his instruction, Shen Baichang and Zhou Shaochang drafted a plan to reorganize the "People's Pictorial" editorial department. In this plan, Ding Cong became the editor-in-chief, and none of the six editors were Party members.

The revealed materials also prove that Ding Cong was not the progressive democrat he boasted about in history. In 1944, Ding Cong worked at the Psychological Warfare Division of the U.S. Army's Strategic Intelligence Agency in Kunming and was a frequent guest of the American military. In a propaganda painting he made for the Strategic Intelligence Agency to eliminate the five poisons, he viciously vilified the Communist Party, which was heroically leading the resistance against Japan, as one of the poisons, equating it with bandits and traitors.

In the face of a large number of facts, Ding Cong, Shen Baichang, Zhou Shaochang, etc., began to admit their anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies.

　　丁聪妄想挂帅独霸画报界
　　人民画报揭露这个当副总编辑的野心家
    据新华社18日讯　“人民画报”副总编辑丁聪（民盟盟员）与另一副总编辑胡考，编辑沈百昌、周绍昌等勾结，企图篡夺人民画报，独霸我国画报界的阴谋活动，已在“人民画报”编辑部最近连续举行的批判会上被揭发并受到批判。据揭发，他们的步骤是：首先篡夺“人民画报”，然后独霸我国画报界。如果此计不成，他们就打算出版两种“人民画报”，制造分裂，将现在“人民画报”所有的党员赶出去，另出画报，由丁聪和他的小集团来把持现有的“人民画报”，将它变质，专向资本主义国家销售。再不行就专门去搞“同人刊物”，和共产党领导的画报唱对台戏。丁聪参与准备搞的“同人刊物”打算专辟一栏，登载其他画报和杂志不用的退稿，并把编辑部的退稿信件一起发表出来。还计划向国外发行。他们计议这个刊物无论在那里出版，都不容许共产党来“干涉内政”。当他们自以为进攻即将得手之时，丁聪就俨然以中国画报传统的化身自居，积极准备“挂帅登场”，在他的授意下，沈百昌和周绍昌草拟了一个改组“人民画报”编辑部的方案。在这个方案里，丁聪就成了总编辑，六个编辑中没有一个党员。
    揭发的材料还证明：丁聪在历史上也并不是像他自己所吹嘘的那样是个进步的民主人士。1944年，丁聪在昆明美军战略情报局心理作战处工作，常为美军座上客。他在为战略情报局所作的一幅除五毒的宣传画中，竟恶毒的污蔑正在英勇领导抗日的共产党是一毒，和土匪、汉奸等相提并论。
    在大量的事实面前，丁聪、沈百昌、周绍昌等开始承认了他们反共反社会主义的阴谋活动。
