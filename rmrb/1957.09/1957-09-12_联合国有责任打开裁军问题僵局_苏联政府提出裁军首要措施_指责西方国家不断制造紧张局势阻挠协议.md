　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko stated on the 10th in a statement on the disarmament issue that the disarmament issue cannot escape the deadlock as long as the United Nations has not begun to study the disarmament issue with due vigor, based on its lofty sense of responsibility for consolidating peace and easing international tensions. The resolution of the disarmament issue is of vital concern to the people of all countries, and therefore, it should not be conducted in closed-door secret consultations. He said that as for the Soviet Union, it will continue to spare no effort to promote practical results on this issue in the future.
　　Gromyko made this statement at a press conference for Soviet and foreign journalists.
　　In the statement, Gromyko proposed that the Soviet government believes that the primary measures that should be taken in disarmament are:
　　1. Stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. This measure is not complicated, it is enough if the Western countries producing atomic weapons – the United States and British governments – agree.
　　2. Withdraw foreign troops from Germany and other European countries where foreign armed forces are still stationed.
　　3. Remove all military bases on the territory of other countries.
　　4. As a measure to prevent sudden attacks and for supervision, the Soviet government proposes that, while reaching an agreement on the initial steps in disarmament, consultations should be held on the establishment of observation posts on an equal basis in major ports, railway hubs, and highway trunk lines. These observation posts should monitor and not allow the dangerous concentration of armed forces and armaments, thereby preventing one country from suddenly attacking another.
　　The Soviet government also suggested consultations on the establishment of observation posts on an equal basis in the territories of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, as well as in the Pacific region, to supervise the implementation by all countries of the obligation to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, which is now entirely feasible.
　　Gromyko said that the United States is now raising another demand, saying that no disarmament issue can be resolved until the outstanding international political issues are resolved. The United States also includes the situation in the Near East among these issues. However, the only reason for the tense situation in this region is that the United States, Britain, and France are constantly and rudely interfering in the affairs of Arab countries, attempting to impose their will on the Arab people and suppress the desire of the people of these countries to live independent and free lives. The situation is similar with many other outstanding international issues, and Western countries are using these issues as an excuse to refuse to reach a disarmament agreement, and these issues cannot be resolved due to the attitude of the Western countries.
　　If an agreement on this or that disarmament issue is to be conditional on the resolution of outstanding international political issues, it means burying the agreement in advance. If this method is insisted upon, then no issue in international relations can be negotiated.
　　Gromyko said that the advocates of expanding armaments are doing everything possible to prevaricate and issue inconsistent statements in order to conceal the essence of their disarmament policy. He pointed out that in this regard, West German Chancellor Adenauer's election speeches are very representative.
　　Gromyko then refuted Adenauer's claim that the world could achieve peace as long as the Soviet Union agreed to atomic disarmament in the manner proposed by Western countries. Gromyko said that the "atomic disarmament" touted by Adenauer in the manner proposed by Western countries actually means continuing to expand armaments, and first of all to expand atomic and hydrogen weapons, because those who determine American foreign policy are unwilling to even hear the words to ban such weapons. Even the suggestion to stop testing such weapons would frighten them.
　　Gromyko mentioned that when Adenauer recently visited the United States, Eisenhower had assured him that if the results of the London disarmament negotiations eased international tensions, a four-power conference would be convened to discuss the issue of German reunification. Gromyko said that without consulting the opinions of other participating countries in the meeting, President Eisenhower or anyone else cannot decide to convene a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the German issue. The Soviet Union has very clearly stated that it does not intend to participate in any four-power conference on the German issue, nor does it intend to participate in any meeting or summit that would delay the resolution of the German issue, because under the current conditions in Germany, this issue can only be resolved by the Germans themselves through negotiations between the two Germanies – the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

　　联合国有责任打开裁军问题僵局
　　苏联政府提出裁军首要措施
　　指责西方国家不断制造紧张局势阻挠协议
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯10日在一项关于裁军问题的声明中说，只要联合国还没有开始本着自己对巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势方面的崇高责任感，以应有的精力研究裁军问题，裁军问题就不可能脱出僵局。裁军问题的解决是各国人民切身攸关的事，因此，不应当关起门来进行密商。他说，至于苏联，它今后仍将不遗余力地在这个问题上促成实际成果。
    葛罗米柯是在一次苏联和外国记者招待会上发表这项声明的。
    葛罗米柯在声明中提出，苏联政府认为在裁军方面应该采取的首要措施是：
    一、停止试验原子武器和氢武器。这个措施并不复杂，只要生产原子武器的西方国家——美国和英国政府同意就足够了。
    二、把外国军队撤出德国和其他还驻有外国武装力量的欧洲国家。
    三、撤除所有在别国领土上的军事基地。
    四、作为防止突然袭击和监督的措施，苏联政府建议在就裁军方面的初步步骤达成协议的同时，协商关于在对等的基础上在大港口、铁路枢纽和公路干线上建立监察哨的问题。这些监察哨应当进行监视，不允许有危险地集中武装力量和军备的情况发生，从而防止一个国家突然袭击另外一个国家。
    苏联政府同时还建议协商关于在对等的基础上在苏联、美国、英国的领土上以及在太平洋地区建立监察哨来督促各国执行目前已经完全能够做到的关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的义务。
    葛罗米柯说，美国现在又提出一个要求，说是悬而未决的国际政治问题未解决以前，任何一个裁军问题都不可能得到解决。美国把近东局势的问题也列入这些问题之内。但是，这个地区局势紧张的唯一原因是，美国、英国、法国不断粗暴地干涉阿拉伯国家的事务，企图把他们的意志强加于阿拉伯人民，压抑这些国家的人民要求独立自由生活的愿望。许多其他悬而未决的国际问题的情况也是如此，西方国家利用这些问题作为他们拒绝达成裁军协定的借口，而这些问题却由于西方国家的态度，不能解决。
    如果这个或那个裁军问题的协定都要以解决悬而未决的国际政治问题为前提，这就意味着事先埋葬了协定。如果坚持这种方法，那么任何一个国际关系方面的问题都无法协商了。
    葛罗米柯说，扩张军备的拥护者正千方百计地支吾躲闪，发表言行不一致的声明，以便掩饰他们的裁军政策的实质。他指出，在这方面，西德总理阿登纳竞选演说是很有代表性的。
    葛罗米柯接着驳斥了阿登纳的所谓只要苏联同意按西方国家所提出的方式来进行原子裁军就能使世界获得和平的说法。葛罗米柯说，阿登纳所吹嘘的按西方国家提出的方式进行“原子裁军”，实际上意味着继续扩张军备，而首先是扩张原子武器和氢武器，因为那些确定美国外交政策的人就连禁止这类武器的话都不愿意听。甚至主张停止试验这类武器的建议都会把他们吓得发抖。
    葛罗米柯谈到阿登纳最近访问美国的时候，艾森豪威尔曾经向他保证，如果伦敦裁军谈判的结果使国际紧张局势有所缓和，就召开四大国会议来讨论德国统一问题。葛罗米柯说，关于这件事如果不征求会议其他参加国的意见，艾森豪威尔总统或其他任何人都不能决定召开苏、美、英、法四大国会议问题。苏联曾经极明确地表示过，它不打算就德国问题参加任何四大国会议，也不打算参加会拖延德国问题解决的任何会议和会晤，因为在德国目前的条件下，这个问题只能由德国人自己通过两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国——的谈判加以解决。
