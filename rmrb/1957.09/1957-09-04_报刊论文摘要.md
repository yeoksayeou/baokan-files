Our Class Analysis Method is a Demon-Revealing Mirror

Without the method of class analysis, it would be difficult to distinguish between enemies, friends, and ourselves in the stage of the New Democratic Revolution; without the method of class analysis, it would also be difficult to distinguish between enemies, friends, and ourselves in the stage of the Socialist Revolution. However, some people are singing the tune that the method of class analysis is outdated while we are carrying out a great socialist revolution politically and ideologically. ... Although the large-scale, mass, and rapid class struggle has basically ended, the class struggle has not ended. The signal of this recent class struggle was first sent out by the bourgeois rightists Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and they forced us to use the method of class analysis to deal with people and things. Since class struggle is an objective reality, we cannot subjectively abolish the method of class analysis. Moreover, we know that the bourgeois rightists are also very skilled in using the method of class analysis, but it is nothing more than the bourgeois class analysis method. This can be proved from the objects of the Six Professors Meeting of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, the five-person drafting group, and Fei Xiaotong's liaison activities. Stalin was right when he said that politics is politics, and politics is a tit-for-tat struggle. Why can the bourgeois rightists use the method of class analysis, but we, the working class, are not allowed to use the method of class analysis? In this anti-rightist struggle, the reason why we were able to put all the demons and monsters, ghosts and goblins who are against the Party, against the people, and against socialism in front of the demon-revealing mirror and expose their true colors is because we have mastered the weapon of the class analysis method.

Was Unified Purchase and Sale Botched?

After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, first of all, grain merchants were excluded from the link of urban and rural exchanges, cutting off the connection between the urban and rural bourgeoisie, making it impossible for them to make waves in economic life; at the same time, it also made it impossible for the rich peasants and some well-to-do middle peasants in the countryside to engage in grain speculation, effectively blocking the road for the development of capitalism in the countryside. The fact is that after the implementation of unified purchase and sale, the position of the urban and rural bourgeoisie has been greatly reduced. This is entirely in line with the interests of socialism. ... From here, we can understand why the rightists and some well-to-do middle peasants and people with capitalist ideas in the countryside have spared no effort to attack the policy of unified purchase and sale. Therefore, we cannot look at the grain issue in isolation, but should link it with the struggle between socialism and capitalism. Since this is a focus of the struggle between the two roads, and not a technical issue, all those who are willing to take the socialist road cannot be vague, or follow the rightists and well-to-do middle peasants, but must firmly stand on their own position and give a rebuff to those who attempt to deny unified purchase and sale. (Excerpted from the editorial of Jilin Daily on August 27: "Stand Firm on the Grain Issue")

To Carry Out Extensive Airing of Views and Great Debates in Rural Areas, It is Necessary to First Improve the Thinking of Cadres

Some cadres still have some concerns about carrying out such a great debate. They said, "We can air our views and debate freely in the organs, but if we air our views and debate freely in the rural areas, it will be chaotic." Some comrades also have a resistant attitude towards this practice. They hope that the leadership will quickly give them a way to "cure" people. Now that they hear that there will be debates, they think that this will not solve the problem. These kinds of understandings are obviously wrong and should be quickly changed in order to ensure the smooth development of the socialist education movement throughout the province. The reason why these comrades have such wrong understandings, in addition to the lack of full understanding of the significance and methods of carrying out the great socialist debate, is that they underestimate the degree of awareness of the basic masses and lack sufficient trust in the ability of the rural Party organizations to lead this political and ideological struggle. They are still accustomed to using the method of "I hit you through" or "the top hits the bottom through," and they are still accustomed to using administrative orders, instead of using democratic debates and mass education. Therefore, to carry out this socialist great debate, it is necessary to improve the ideological understanding of the leadership, and at the same time, it is necessary to change the leadership style. The process of carrying out the great debate is also the process of improving thinking and changing the work style. In this political and ideological struggle, cadres at all levels should first educate themselves and then educate the masses. (Excerpted from the editorial of Dazhong Daily on August 25: "Great Debate is a Good Method for Mass Self-Education")

    报刊论文摘要
    我们的阶级分析方法是照妖镜
    离开了阶级分析的方法，就很难分清在新民主主义革命阶段中的敌、友、我的问题；离开了阶级分析的方法，也就很难分清在社会主义革命阶段中的敌、友、我的问题。但是，竟然有人在我们进行着政治上思想上社会主义大革命的时候，高唱其阶级分析方法过时论的调子。……尽管大规模的、群众性的、急风骤雨的阶级斗争基本上结束了，可是，阶级斗争并没有结束。最近这一次阶级斗争的信号，首先是从资产阶级右派分子章伯钧和罗隆基那里发射出来的，是他们迫使我们不能不用阶级分析的方法来对人对事。阶级斗争既然是客观存在着的，那么，我们就不能在主观上取消阶级分析的方法。而且我们知道，阶级分析的方法，资产阶级右派分子也是运用得非常熟练的，无非它是资产阶级的阶级分析方法而已。这从章罗联盟的六教授会议、五人起草小组和费孝通的串联活动中的对象等等，都可以证明这一点。斯大林说得对，政治就是政治，政治是针锋相对的斗争，为什么资产阶级右派分子可以用阶级分析的方法，而独独不许我们工人阶级运用阶级分析的方法呢？这次反右派斗争中，我们之所以能够把一切反党、反人民、反社会主义的魑魅魍魉、牛鬼蛇神放到照妖镜面前，使他们原形毕露，就因为我们掌握了阶级分析方法这个武器。（摘自1957年“哲学研究”第四期孙定国：“反对哲学思想中的修正主义”）
        统购统销搞糟了吗？
    实行粮食的统购统销之后，首先是把粮食商人从城乡交流的环节中排除出去，切断了城乡资产阶级的联系，使得他们没有可能在经济生活中兴风作浪；同时也使得农村中的富农和一部分富裕中农没有可能从事粮食投机，有力地堵塞了在农村发展资本主义的道路。事实就是这样的，实行统购统销之后，城乡资产阶级的阵地是被大大地缩小了。这是完全符合社会主义的利益的。……从这里我们就可以理解为什么右派分子和农村中的一部分富裕中农及有资本主义思想的人那样不遗余力地攻击统购统销政策。因此我们不能孤立地看粮食问题，应该把它和社会主义、资本主义这两条道路的斗争联系起来。既然这是两条道路斗争的一个焦点，不是什么技术性的问题，一切愿意走社会主义道路的人，就不能含含糊糊，或是跟在右派分子和富裕中农后边随声附合，必须坚定地站稳自己的立场，对于企图否定统购统销的分子给以回击。  （摘自8月27日吉林日报社论：“在粮食问题上站稳立场”）
      开展农村大鸣大放必先提高干部思想
    有些干部对开展这样的大辩论还存在一些疑虑，他们说，“在机关可以大放大鸣，在农村大放大鸣就会放乱了。”还有的同志对这一作法存有抵触情绪，他们希望领导上快给个法子去“治”人，现在听说要辩论，认为这样作不解决问题。这种种认识显然是错误的，应迅速加以转变，才能保证社会主义教育运动在全省范围内顺利开展。这些同志所以存在这样的错误认识，除对开展社会主义大辩论的意义和作法尚缺乏充分的了解以外，还有一个重要原因，就是他们对基本群众的觉悟程度估计不足，对农村党的组织有能力来领导这一次政治思想斗争缺乏足够的信任。他们还习惯采用我打你通或上打下通的办法，还习惯采用行政命令的办法，而不习惯采用民主辩论、群众教育群众的办法。所以，开展这一次社会主义的大辩论，既要求提高领导思想认识，同时又要求转变领导作风，开展大辩论的过程，也就是提高思想转变作风的过程。各级干部在这一场政治思想斗争中，都应当首先使自己受到教育，然后教育群众。（摘自8月25日大众日报社论：“大辩论是群众自我教育的良好方法”）
