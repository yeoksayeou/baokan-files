This newspaper, Xi'an, 23rd: Workers at the Xi'an Dahua Textile Factory are in high spirits during the "airing views" process. They are not only actively speaking at seminars, but also brainstorming ideas for improving work while walking home from work and eating in the cafeteria.

To date, workers have submitted 1,325 suggestions to the leadership. The vast majority of these suggestions are beneficial to the work, and many point out shortcomings that the leadership had not previously noticed. Among them, more than 400 relate to enterprise management. Workers have expressed considerable opinions in big-character posters and seminars regarding the factory's promotion of deputy foremen. Originally, the factory was reorganized into section management at the beginning of this year, and a group of deputy foremen needed to be promoted to take charge of section machine repair and production management. However, the factory did not cultivate and promote veterans with many years of machine repair experience (mostly sixth, seventh, and eighth-grade workers), but mostly promoted young workers from cloth removers and machine operators. These people originally did not understand machine repair technology and, after studying for half a year, became deputy foremen. When machines broke down, they often could not be repaired in time. On the other hand, some old machine repair workers had no work to do and were assigned to repair shuttles or do some unskilled tasks such as yarn piecing.

Many workers have offered opinions on the bureaucratic style of leadership personnel who do not frequently go to the workshops and do not solve problems in a timely manner. For example, worker Zheng Xinjie suggested modifying the yarn machine so that it could be operated by one person instead of three, and also save a lot of cotton cloth for yarn wrapping. Zheng Xinjie had submitted his suggestion to the leadership twice in the past, but had received no response. This time, he criticized the leadership at the meeting.

The leading cadres of the factory have received profound education in this mobilization of workers to offer opinions. Now, they have classified and sorted out the opinions raised by the workers, and distributed them to relevant workshops and departments for research. Preliminary handling opinions have been put forward on some issues. (Attached picture)

    西安大华纺织厂工人踊跃参加鸣放
    提出的意见大多数有利工作
    本报西安23日电　西安大华纺织厂工人在鸣放过程中情绪非常高涨，他们不仅在座谈会上踊跃发言，下班时走在路上和在食堂吃饭的时候也在酝酿着提改进工作的意见。
    现在工人们给领导上已经提出一千三百二十五条意见。这些意见绝大部分是对工作有利的，并且有很多是过去领导上没有发现的缺点。其中有关企业管理方面的占四百多条。工人们在大字报和座谈会上提意见较多的是厂里提拔副工长的问题。原来这个厂今年年初改成分工段管理，需要提拔一批副工长担任段的修机工作和生产管理工作。但是该厂没有从担任多年修机工作的老技工（多是六、七、八级工）中培养和提拔，而多半是从拆布工和值车工中提拔的年青工人。这些人原来不懂修机技术，学习了半年后就当副工长，机器发生毛病往往不能及时修好。而另外一些老修机工却没有活干，被派去修理梭子，或者做一些不需要技术的接纱等工作。
    很多工人对领导人员不经常下车间和不及时解决问题的官僚主义作风提出意见。例如工人郑心洁建议改装纱车，这样可以由三个人操作改成一个人操作，还可以节约很多装纱用的棉布包。郑心洁过去向领导上提了两次建议都没有得到答复。这次他在会上向领导上提出批评。
    该厂的领导干部在这次发动工人提意见中受到了深刻的教育。现在，他们已经将工人们提出的意见分门别类进行整理后，分发到有关车间和科室进行研究，对有些问题已经提出了初步处理意见。（附图片）
