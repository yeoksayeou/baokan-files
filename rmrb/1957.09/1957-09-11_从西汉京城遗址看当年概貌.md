A Glimpse of the Past from the Ruins of the Western Han Dynasty Capital

The capital of the Western Han Dynasty, Chang'an, lies approximately ten kilometers northwest of the present-day city of Xi'an. In the vast plains, one sees undulating remnants of walls, with layers upon layers of tiles scattered among the deep ditches and broken cliffs. One can imagine the magnificent scale and flourishing scene of the past.

The Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences dispatched a working team to the site for investigation in October 1956 and has since cleared three city gates. After research, it has been determined that these are Zhicheng Gate (located in the center of the west side), Bacheng Gate (located at the southern end of the east side), and Xi'an Gate (located at the western end of the south side) among the twelve city gates on all four sides of the capital at that time. The city walls were built of rammed earth and were sixteen meters thick, with a degree of solidity comparable to brick walls. This can be seen from the fact that these three city gates still maintain a considerable majestic appearance. All three city gates were destroyed by fire, and the gate openings are filled with purplish-red burnt earth, broken tiles, and broken bricks. The fire probably occurred during the many wars at the end of the Wang Mang period.

Zhicheng Gate has three gate openings, each about eight meters wide, separated by about four meters (see attached picture). One of the gate openings is about sixteen meters long, with a row of square stones laid flat at the front, like a threshold. The two blocks at both ends serve as door bases, where the door leaves were installed. In this gate opening, one can still see traces of cart ruts from that time. More than 1,900 years ago, Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty celebrated the victory over Zhizhi Chanyu and issued an amnesty decree here.

Only two gate openings were found at Xi'an Gate, and only one gate opening was found at Bacheng Gate. However, based on the remains and measurements, it is confirmed that these two city gates also each had three gate openings, with similar widths and distances as Zhicheng Gate. Some ruins north of Xi'an Gate also prove the existence of the famous Weiyang Palace and Shiqu Pavilion.

The main streets inside the city were also divided into three parallel roads leading directly to the city gate openings, with the same width as the city gate openings. The entire street with three lanes could accommodate twelve horse-drawn carriages side by side. The central lane was the "chidao" (imperial road), exclusively for the emperor's use.

The excavation work is currently underway. A more accurate judgment will be made on the layout of the capital, which covers an area of more than fifty li (approximately 25 kilometers), as well as the locations of its palaces, neighborhoods, and markets.

### 从西汉京城遗址看当年概貌

　　从西汉京城遗址看当年概貌
    西汉的首都长安城，在今西安市区西北约十公里。在辽阔的平野上，但见残垣蜿蜒起伏，深沟断崖之间尽是重重叠叠的瓦片。昔日壮大的规模和繁华的景象，于此可以想见。
    中国科学院考古研究所派遣工作队从1956年10月开始到遗址勘查，已清理出三个城门。经考证判明，这是当时京城四面十二个城门中的直城门（位于西面中央）、霸城门（位于东面南头）、西安门（位于南面西头）。城墙是版筑的土墙，厚十六公尺，坚固程度不下于砖墙，这可以从这三个城门至今还保持着相当雄伟的姿态上看出。三个城门都毁于火，门洞内填满烧成紫红色墙土、残瓦、碎砖。火大约是在王莽末年多次战争中发生的。
    直城门有三个门洞，各宽八公尺左右，相隔约四公尺（见附图）。其中一个门洞，长约十六公尺，最前方平铺一列方石，有如门槛，两端的两块为门础，是设置门扉的所在。在这门洞里还可以看出当时的车辙痕迹。一千九百多年前，汉元帝曾在这里庆祝对郅支单于战事的胜利结束和颁布天下大赦的命令。
    在西安门只发现二个门洞，霸城门只发现一个门洞。但根据遗迹和测算，证实这二个城门也各有三个门洞，宽度和距离同直城门相仿。西安门北一些残墟，还证明是有名的未央宫和石渠阁等遗迹。
    城内大街也分成并列的三条道路，直通城门洞，宽度同城门洞一样。全街三条道，可容十二辆马车并行。中央一条道是“驰道”，专供皇帝行走的。
    现在发掘工作正在进行。对这座方圆五十多华里的京城的形势以及它的宫殿、街坊、市集的位置，将可以作出更加准确的判断。
