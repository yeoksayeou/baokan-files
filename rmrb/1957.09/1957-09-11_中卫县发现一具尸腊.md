　　Corpse Wax Discovered in Zhongwei County
    During the recent construction of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway in Zhongwei County, Gansu Province, a complete corpse wax was unearthed.

    This corpse wax is approximately 390 years old. According to the epitaph, the deceased was named Liu Yi, a "Mobile General" of the Ming Dynasty, who died during the Jiajing period at the age of 51.

    The corpse wax weighs 99 jin (approximately 49.5 kg) and is 1.65 meters long.

    The skin of the whole body is dark brown, with clear textures and pores, and still has elasticity. The face is round and plump. The head has complete facial features and hair. The joints of the hands and feet can still be bent slightly. All internal organs are completely preserved, and the heart, lungs, stomach, and intestines are still soft and elastic. There are still residual whipworm eggs in the large intestine.

    Staff of the Pathological Anatomy Teaching and Research Group of Lanzhou Medical College believe that the formation of this corpse wax is due to the deceased being buried in a moisture-rich environment, isolated from the air, which slowed down the putrefaction process. The water loosened the skin and seeped into it, washing away putrefactive substances and putrefactive bacteria from the body, thus slowing down or even stopping the putrefaction process. The decomposition of fat in this type of corpse is accelerated. Glycerol and oleic acid are carried away by the water that permeates the skin and organs. The other part of the fat decomposition products—stearic acid and palmitic acid—react chemically with the calcium and magnesium in the water and the ammonia from the body's protein decomposition, forming salts. This is how corpse wax is formed, which is different from the more common formation of mummification.

    The corpse wax was unearthed on August 16th. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

### 中卫县发现一具尸腊

　　中卫县发现一具尸腊
    甘肃省中卫县境内最近在修筑包兰铁路时发掘出了一具完整的尸腊。
    这具尸腊已历时三百九十多年，根据墓志铭的记载，死者叫刘仪，是明朝的“游击将军”，死于嘉靖年间，死时年五十一岁。
    尸腊重九十九市斤，长一点六五公尺。
    全身皮肤呈暗褐色，纹理和毛孔都清晰可见，且仍有弹性。脸部又圆又胖。头部五官、头发俱全。手脚关节还能轻微弯动。内脏器官全部保存无缺，心、肺、肠胃等依然柔软有弹性，大肠内还有残留的鞭虫卵。
    兰州医学院病理解剖教研组的工作人员认为，这具尸腊的形成，是死者埋在富有水份的环境里，并同空气隔绝，腐败过程减慢的缘故。水使皮肤疏松，并渗进皮肤，将机体内腐败物质及腐败性细菌冲走，故腐败过程更减慢，甚至停止。这种尸体的脂肪分解是加速的，其中甘油与油酸，被浸透入皮肤和脏器内的水分带走，脂肪的另一部分分解物——硬脂酸和软脂酸却和水中的钙、镁及体内蛋白质分解的氨起化学反应，形成盐类。这样就形成了尸腊，这和较常见的尸干化的形成不同。
    尸腊是在8月16日出土的。（据新华社讯）
