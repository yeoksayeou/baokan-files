    A Stormy Night on the Construction Site
    On the night of August 26th, dark clouds gathered, and the gale mixed with rain threads made the lights on the construction site of the Angang Gas Generation Station seem even weaker. However, a large group of builders were still working hard here.
    By a little after midnight on the morning of August 27th, a sudden thunderclap, followed by a violent storm with torrential rain, poured down.
    "Not good, a cave-in is about to happen!" Someone shouted. The newly dug foundation pit of the coal storage tank collapsed with a crash. The workers of Chi Zhendong's group, responsible for digging ditches and draining water, were anxious. They all jumped down, splattered with mud, and quickly managed to fix the situation.
    One disturbing accident followed another. Because the rain was heavy, the sand in the water clogged the water pump nozzle in the drainage well, rendering the pump useless. In an instant, the construction site was filled with water again. Team leader Zheng Fuxiang, who was working, dropped his tools and rushed to the well. He waved his right hand and shouted loudly:
    "Who will come down into the well with me to pull out the nozzle?"
    "I'll go!" "I'll go!"
    "The old and weak stay behind!" Zheng Fuxiang said, leading six team members into the drainage well. The water inside the well was chilling to the skin, but no one cared. Together, they used all their strength to pull the water pump nozzle out of the mud, and the water gurgled out again.
    The concrete team led by Liu Wanyi had an even more intense day of work. Concrete pouring had to be completed in one go. If it was interrupted for a moment, the quality of the project would not be guaranteed, and work had to continue even in heavy rain. However, the quality of the concrete would also be reduced if it was washed by the rain. What to do? Worker Meng Qingfeng came up with a trick: covering the foundation with straw mats, cutting an opening in the middle, and pouring the concrete downwards. This problem was solved. But the scaffolding was too slippery. Yu Zhanxiang was pushing a cart of concrete from above and accidentally slipped. He immediately came up with a solution, spreading a layer of slag on the scaffolding, and it was as smooth as a flat road. With everyone's active efforts, the pouring task was completed before dawn.
    At four o'clock in the morning, the rain gradually subsided. All the tasks for the night were overfulfilled, and when the workers who were going to work the day shift arrived, they found that the construction site looked as if it had not been hit by a storm. Construction continued.

### 工地上的暴风雨之夜

    工地上的暴风雨之夜
    8月26日夜，乌云密布，狂风夹带着雨丝，鞍钢煤气发生站工地上的灯光，显得更加微弱，可是大群建设者还在这里紧张施工。
    时间到了8月27日早晨零点多钟，突然一声霹雳，暴风夹着骤雨，瓢泼似的倾注下来。
    “不好，要塌方了！”不知谁喊了一声。贮煤槽刚挖好的基础坑哗啦啦地倾下一块来。负责挖沟排水的迟振东小组的工人发急了，他们都跳下去，泥浆溅了满身，一会儿就抢救好了。
    使人不安的事故接踵而来。因为雨下得猛，水中含沙把排水井里的水泵龙头堵塞住了，水泵失去了效用，刹时工地上又积满了水。正在干活的组长郑福祥丢下工具，急忙赶到井边。他挥着右手高声喊道：
    “谁跟我下井去拔出龙头？”
    “我去！”“我去！”
    “年老体弱的留下！”郑福祥说完，领着六个组员一起跨入排水井。井内的积水浸着肌肤凉森森的，可是谁也顾不得了，一起用劲从淤泥里把水泵龙头拔了出来，水又哗哗的向外排着。
    刘万仪领导的混凝土小队，这一天的工作更紧张。混凝土浇灌必须一气完成，如果中断一会，工程质量就保不住，遇到大雨也得继续干下去。可是，混凝土被雨水冲着也会降低质量，怎么办呢？工人孟庆风想出了窍门；用席子把基础盖住，当中切开一个口，向下浇灌混凝土。这个问题解决了。但是跳板太滑。于占祥推着一车混凝土从上边经过，不小心滑了下来。他马上就想出了办法，在跳板上敷了一层矿渣，果然像平道一样了。大家积极努力，浇灌任务不到天亮就完成了。
    早晨四点钟，雨渐渐变小，当晚所有的任务都超额完成，作白班的工人赶来的时候，发现工地上像未遭到暴风雨一样。施工继续进行着。
