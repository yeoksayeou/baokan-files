The Plight of Japanese Farmers
——Watching the Japanese Film "Rice"
Li Shaobai

The Japanese film "Rice" presents us with a vivid picture of the real life of Japanese rural areas: how honest and hardworking Japanese farmers toil selflessly, how they live in poverty and suffering, and what a tragic end their fate is! It should be affirmed that this is an excellent film with social significance. The screenwriter, Yagi Yasutaro, and the director, Imai Tadashi, are faithful to the life they reflect, and portray the Japanese countryside without embellishment. They not only reproduce the impoverished life and tragic fate of Japanese farmers but also write about the root of this impoverished life and tragic fate—the cruel exploitation and oppression of landlords and fishery capitalists.

Japanese farmers are kind and hardworking; they have no extravagant hopes, they only seek to maintain the minimum living standard of being human, and for this, they are willing to work day and night without rest! Every time we see Yoneko and her daughter, Chiyo, working in the fields during the day: removing weeds from the rice paddies with their hands, stepping on the waterwheels step by step, cutting the rice ears one by one, exhausting themselves, standing up to beat their sore backs, and then bending down again...; every time we see them going out to sea to fish at night: laboriously rowing the oars, lifting the knotted nets to pick off those few sparse eels, and laboriously carrying the fish baskets ashore...: we cannot suppress the excitement in our hearts! They are hardworking, working inhumanly; besides labor, it is still labor!

Logically speaking, should their lives be well-off like this? At least, should they be able to maintain the minimum standard of living? But no, they are so impoverished! Unable to pay the children's tuition, having no grain to eat and having to cut the green valley! Life is forcing them like this, exploitation and oppression are tormenting them like this. Can we say that Yoneko is not a strong woman? She silently endured all this and shouldered all this. She is brave! But life's compulsion and torment for her do not stop there! When she is about to harvest the plump grains of rice—the fruits of her hard work day and night—the landlord wants to take back the land she rents; the police want her to pay 10,000 yuan or be summoned for her "illegal" behavior! An ordinary peasant woman cannot bear all this, she commits suicide by jumping into the sea! This is life forcing her; she has not found a better way, she uses death to accuse that unreasonable social system, and uses death to protest against those exploiters and oppressors.

The author is familiar with his characters and is also good at expressing them, at highlighting their personalities, and at revealing their rich and complex thoughts and feelings through life details. The author not only writes about their simplicity, diligence, and kindness, which are common characteristics of Japanese farmers, but also writes about their individual characteristics formed by different experiences and encounters. The images of Japanese farmers such as Yoneko, Tsuguo, Chiyo, and Senkichi, shaped in the film, are real, moving, and lifelike.

The most prominent artistic feature of this film is the director's and cinematographer's exceptionally vivid handling of the scenes of farmers' daily labor. These scenes are closely linked to the theme, closely linked to the plot; they are not independent of the film but an indispensable and important part of the film as a whole. Many scenes in the film take place and progress in these scenes. It is also in these scenes that the author very skillfully displays the hard work and heavy and painful working lives of Japanese farmers. The reason why these scenes are handled well is that, on the one hand, the author realistically and meticulously reproduces the situation of the farmers' heavy labor. Like the scene of transplanting rice seedlings, the scene of fishing at sea, the hands pulling weeds, the tired bodies, the back view of carrying the fish basket ashore, the figure of laboriously rowing the oars..., all truthfully and movingly expressing the hardship and heavy labor of Japanese farmers. On the other hand, the author links the working place of his characters with the vast space of nature. Like the green seawater connecting to the azure sky, white sails raised on the sea surface, like the rice paddies where the Tsuguo family transplanted rice seedlings, backed by seawater and clear sky, like Chiyo stepping on the waterwheel, below is a green rice field..., all of these give an unusual sense of beauty, making the farmers' labor scenes in the film even more real. At the same time, this also reveals the author's love for the beautiful nature of his motherland, love for labor, and love for the working people.

In portraying these scenes of farmers' working lives, the author's use and linking of far and close views are very appropriate. Here, the author beautifies the labor scenes, which not only does not dilute the heavy nature of the labor but also forms a more distinct contrast. The more beautiful the labor scene, the more it can show the heavy nature of the labor, the more it can make people understand the painful lives of Japanese farmers, and the more it can arouse people's love and hate.

The acting skills of the actors in this film are also excellent. There is no trace of pretension in their performances, as simple and natural as real life; but it is different from real life, their expressions and actions are more characteristic and expressive. Especially in the labor scenes they performed, they were like real farmers, their movements were so natural, and their operations were so skilled. It can be seen that they have done a serious observation of the life they want to express. It is this observation that gives their art life—truth.

If I were to talk about the shortcomings of this film, I think its theme is not very prominent and clear, and the structure is not rigorous enough. The main reason, I think, is that the author did not integrate the lives of the rural young fishermen and the fate of Yoneko, which he wanted to express, very well into a complete story. I think the second half of the film is better than the first half, and it can reveal the essence of life and move people's hearts more. The more joyful elements in the first half and the tragic atmosphere in the second half are not handled harmoniously enough, resulting in a lack of unity in style. In addition, there are some unnecessary scenes and plots that are not very relevant to the theme, which also makes the development of the film's plot not focused enough, making the structure appear loose.

The reason for pointing out the shortcomings of this film is precisely because I love this film. These shortcomings are individual. As for the entire film, it is excellent. Its positive theme and excellent artistic skills make the film vivid and moving. It will be welcomed by our audience.

### 日本农民的遭遇——看日本影片“米”

    日本农民的遭遇
    ——看日本影片“米”
    李少白
    日本影片“米”，给我们展示了一幅生动的日本农村现实生活的图画：诚实、勤劳的日本农民是怎样辛苦忘我的劳动着，怎样过着贫困痛苦的生活，他们的命运又是怎样一个悲惨的结局！应当肯定，这是一部具有社会意义的优秀影片。编剧八木保太郎、导演今井正忠实于自己所反映的生活，对日本农村作了毫不粉饰的描写，不仅再现了日本农民的贫困生活和悲惨命运，也写出了这种贫困生活和悲惨命运的根源——地主、渔业资本家的残酷剥削和压迫。
    日本农民是善良、勤劳的，他们没有什么奢望，他们只求维持自己作人的最低生活，为了这，他们甘愿日夜不息的劳动！每当我们看见米子和她的女儿千代白天下地干活：用双手拔除着稻田里的草，一步步踏动着水车，一把把割着稻谷，弄得筋疲力尽，站起来捶捶酸痛的腰，接着又弯下身去……；每当我们看见她们夜间出海捕鱼：吃力地摇动着桨，提起绳结网摘下那几条稀稀的鳗鱼，又费力地提着鱼篮上岸……：我们都压制不住自己内心的激动！她们是勤劳的，是那样非人地劳动着，除了劳动，还是劳动！
    照理说，这样她们的生活应该充裕了吧？至少该能维持最低生活了吧？但是不，她们是那样的贫困不堪！缴不起孩子的学费，没粮吃而不得不割下青谷！生活就是这样逼迫她们，剥削和压迫就是这样折磨她们。我们能说米子不是一个坚强的女人吗？她默默地忍受了这一切，承担了这一切。她是勇敢的！可是生活对她的逼迫、折磨并不到此为止！当她正要收下那颗粒肥大的稻谷——日夜辛勤劳动的果实的时候，地主要收回她佃种的地；警察要她为她的“犯法”行为拿出一万块钱或受传讯！一个普通的农民妇女，忍受不了这一切，她投海自杀了！这是生活逼迫她的，她没有找到更好的路，她以死对那个不合理的社会制度提出控诉，以死对那些剥削者和压迫者表示抗议。
    作者是熟悉自己的人物的，也是善于表现自己的人物的，善于突出他们的性格，善于通过生活细节揭示出他们丰富复杂的思想感情。作者不仅写出了他们朴实、勤劳、善良这些日本农民所共有的特点，也写出了他们由不同经历、不同遭遇而形成的个性特征。影片所塑造的米子、次男、千代、仙吉这些日本农民的形象，是真实的、动人的、栩栩如生的。
    这部影片最突出的艺术特色，是导演、摄影师异常生动地处理了农民日常劳动的场面。这些场面紧紧地扣合着主题，紧紧地扣合着情节，它不是独立于影片之外的，而是影片整体不可割舍的重要部分，影片的许多戏都是在这些场面中发生的、进展的，也正是在这些场面里，作者十分富有才华地展示了日本农民的辛苦勤恳和沉重痛苦的劳动生活。这些场面之所以处理得好，一方面是作者把农民的沉重劳动的情形真实而细致地再现出来。像插秧的情景，下海捕鱼的情景，拔草的双手，疲倦的身躯，提着鱼篮上岸的背影，吃力摇桨的身影……，都真实、动人地表现了日本农民的艰苦和沉重的劳动。另一方面，作者把自己人物的劳动场所和大自然的广阔空间联系起来。像碧绿的海水连接着蔚蓝的天空，海面上扬起一幅幅白帆，像次男家插秧的稻田，背后衬配着海水和晴空，像千代踩动着水车，下面是一片绿绿的稻田……，这些都给人以异常的美感，使影片的农民劳动场面，更加显得真实。同时这也表露了作者对自己祖国美丽大自然的热爱，对劳动的热爱，对劳动人民的热爱。
    表现农民劳动生活的这些场面，作者远、近景的运用、扣合，十分得当。在这里，作者使劳动的景场美化，不但没有冲淡劳动的沉重情形，反而更加形成鲜明的对比。劳动的场景越美丽，越加能显示劳动的沉重情形，越加使人理解日本农民的痛苦生活，越加能激起人们的爱憎。
    这部影片演员的演技，也是优秀的，他们的表演没有一点做作的痕迹，像实生活一样的朴素、自然；但又不同于实生活，他们的表情、动作，要更富有特征性和表现力。特别是他们表演的那些劳动场面，他们像是真正的农民，动作是那样的自然，操作是那样的熟练。可以看出他们对自己所要表现的生活是作过一番认真的体察的。也正是这种体察，使他们的艺术获得了生命——真实。
    如果要说这部影片的缺点的话，我觉得它的主题还不十分突出和明确，结构也还不够严谨。主要的原因，我觉得是作者没有把自己所要表现的农村青年渔民的生活和米子的命运这两条线索很好的揉合一起，成为一个完整的故事。我觉得影片的后半部戏，要比前半部戏为好，更能揭露生活的实质，更能打动人心。前半部戏更多的欢乐成分和后半部戏的悲剧气氛，处理得还不够融洽，造成风格上的不够统一。另外影片还有一些不十分必要的、与主题关系不大的场面和情节，这也是影片的剧情发展不够集中，使结构显得松散。
    提出这部影片的缺点，正是因为我喜爱这部影片。这些缺点是个别的，就整个影片来说，它是优秀的，它那积极的主题，卓越的艺术技巧，使影片生动而感人。它是会受到我国观众的欢迎的。
