Go see the exhibition
Go see the exhibition, go see the exhibition,
Go taste the chaff we swallowed in the old days,
Go wear the tattered clothes of the old days,
Go count how many tears you shed in the old society!
Go pick a socialist flower and place it in your heart,
Go pluck a cooperative sweet fruit and hold it in your mouth,
Go compare the life of the past with the life of today,
Go see the exhibition, go see the exhibition!
    Shoes
These are shoes with broken soles,
These are shoes with rotten uppers,
These are shoes stained with tears!
These are shoes worn by Grandpa Sun of the village,
These are shoes worn by the suffering peasants of the old society,
These are shoes of the broken countryside of old China!
Grandpa Sun! Why do you turn your face away from these shoes?
Oh! You are afraid that the tears in your eyes will fall down
And wet the brand new shoes on your feet...
    Who Says Unified Purchase and Marketing is Bad?
Who says unified purchase and marketing is bad?
Come here and see!
Look! This is Boss Ji, who used to run the grain store,
Hugging the large and small measures stained with the blood and sweat of the peasants,
Carrying the capitalist memorial tablet on his back, shouting madly!
Look! That is Zheng Laohei, the rich peasant of Beiwei,
Seeing the steaming food in other people's bowls,
Sharpening his teeth and reddening his eyes!
Look! Those are the several "lukewarm households" (note) in the village,
Grain rotting in the cellar,
Still complaining that the granary is not full!
Who says unified purchase and marketing is bad?
Here is the answer for you!
(Note) Lukewarm households refer to prosperous middle peasants
    Give Your Heart to the Cooperative
Having visited the gallery of cooperation,
It's like walking through years of roads...
A man strides forward,
A woman follows closely.
--Honey, slow down!
--I want to send my application to join the cooperative to the director.
--Look at you! Isn't our family already in the cooperative?
--No! I want to join the cooperative again, to truly give my heart to the cooperative!

    看展览去
    王鸿
    看展览去
    看展览去，看展览去，
    去尝一尝当年咽剩的糠秕，
    去穿一穿当年的破衣，
    去数一数自己在旧社会滴过多少颗泪珠！
    去采一朵社会主义的鲜花摆在心里，
    去摘一颗合作化的甜果含在嘴里，
    去将往日的生活和今天的生活比一比，
    看展览去，看展览去！
    鞋
    这是一双断底的鞋，
    这是一双烂帮的鞋，
    这是一双沾满泪水的鞋！
    这是庄上孙老爹穿过的鞋，
    这是旧社会苦难的农民穿过的鞋，
    这是旧中国破碎的农村穿过的鞋！
    孙老爹啊！你看到这双鞋为什么偏过了脸庞？
    哦！你是怕满眶热泪掉下来
    落湿脚上簇新的鞋。……
    谁说统购统销不好？
    谁说统购统销不好？
    你到这里来看！
    呐！这是开过粮行的计老板，
    搂着染满农民血汗的大斗小秤，
    背着资本主义的灵牌，疯狂叫喊！
    呐！那是北圩的富农郑老黑，
    看到别人家碗里热气腾腾，
    磨亮牙齿，睁红了眼！
    呐！那是乡里的几家“温吞户”（注）
    粮食烂在窑里，
    还嫌囤里不满！
    谁说统购统销不好？
    这里给你答案！
    （注）温吞户是指富裕中农
    把心儿交给社
    参观了合作化的画廊，
    像走完多少年的道路……
    一个汉子迈开脚步，
    一个女人紧紧跟着。
    ——孩子他爹，慢点走啊！
    ——我要向社长送上入社申请书。
    ——瞧你说的！我家不是早就入了社？
    ——不啊！我要再一次入社，真正把心儿交给社！
