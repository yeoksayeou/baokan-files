Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 25th: The Vietnam News Agency, citing Saigon newspapers, reports that taxes and levies in South Vietnam continue to increase. Recently, the South Vietnamese Minister of Finance announced that taxes on paper would increase by 40% to 60%.

Due to the increased taxation, many South Vietnamese importers are unable to take delivery of goods from warehouses. They are repurchasing these goods when the authorities confiscate and auction them off, because the cost of doing so is less than the taxes levied on the goods stored in the warehouse.

    南越提高苛捐杂税
    据新华社河内25日电　越南通讯社引西贡报纸的报道说，南越的捐税继续增加。最近，南越财政部长宣布，纸张的捐税增加40％到60％。
    由于课税增加，许多南越进口商无力向仓库提货。他们在当局把这些货物充公拍卖时重新买回来，因为这样做的费用比货物存在仓库中征收的税款要少。
