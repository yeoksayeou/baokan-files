The U.S. side is attempting to deny the crime of dispatching armed agents to cross the border and sneak into northern Korea to spy on military intelligence and murder our civilian police. But this cannot be denied. Our military personnel interrogated the U.S. armed agent Wang Zhenjiang (pictured lying down) in front of the U.S. observation team. The agent's confession irrefutably confirms the U.S. side's violation of the armistice agreement.
