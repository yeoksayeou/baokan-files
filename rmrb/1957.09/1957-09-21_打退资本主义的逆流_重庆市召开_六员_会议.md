    Repulse the Capitalist Countercurrent
    Chongqing Holds "Six Personnel" Meeting
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 17th. From September 12th to 14th, Chongqing held a "Six Personnel" meeting. More than 800 attendees from the commercial sector including wholesale staff, personnel involved in the transformation of private businesses, public representatives, market management personnel, tax collectors, and bank loan officers, received a most profound and practical socialist education from the exposure of numerous speculative and illegal activities of private merchants.
    According to revelations at the meeting, the speculative activities of illegal industrialists, businessmen, and handicraftsmen in Chongqing have not only failed to decrease recently, but have instead shown a gradually increasing trend. They acquired and snapped up state-controlled commodities, raised prices for raw materials, adulterated products, and passed off inferior goods as superior ones. Some private personnel in joint ventures organized "underground factories," used high wages to lure workers in employment, stole state raw materials, and engaged in black market activities. Some handicraft households have developed into large workshops. For example, the Fu Yu couple in the sewing industry employed as many as 140 people (now ordered to disband). Handicraftsman Huang Jianming went from producing and selling on his own to employing 32 people. The arrogance of speculative merchants was rampant, with some even verbally abusing wholesale staff, assaulting public representatives, or collectively causing trouble at state-owned wholesale stores.
    Attendees reflected on the shortcomings in the work of state-owned commercial, tax, banking, and industrial and commercial administrative departments. For example, some cadres in the commercial sector, when arranging sources of goods for small merchants, one-sidedly emphasized taking care of them, neglecting transformation, allocating too many fast-selling goods to merchants, and generally setting excessive business volume for small merchants. Tax collection work lacked inspection, and the phenomenon of tax evasion by merchants throughout the city was serious, with approximately 400,000 yuan in taxes due but uncollected since last year. People's Bank loans lacked strict review and control. Industrial and commercial administrative departments failed to formulate reasonable management measures in a timely manner according to new market conditions, allowing illegal industrialists and businessmen to exploit loopholes, leading to an increasing number of unlicensed industrial and commercial households. In addition, relevant units were not timely in handling capitalist speculators and illegal elements, failing to prosecute those who should have been prosecuted, failing to fine those who should have been fined, and in some cases, being too lenient in their handling. These shortcomings have inadvertently condoned and fostered the development of capitalism. Many people at the meeting admitted that after the establishment of public-private joint ownership across all industries, they had an insufficient understanding of capitalist illegal speculative activities and the spontaneous forces of small merchants, developed complacency, and relaxed or even abandoned leadership and management, allowing capitalism to run rampant. They expressed that the transformation of capitalism and market management work should not only not be weakened in the future, but should be vigorously strengthened.
    Responsible cadres from the Chongqing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, the Cooperative Commerce Bureau, the Urban Services Bureau, the Tax Bureau, and the People's Bank of China spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to further adopt effective economic and administrative measures based on the current new market situation to strengthen market management and the socialist transformation of industrialists and businessmen.

    打退资本主义的逆流
    重庆市召开“六员”会议
    据新华社重庆17日电　重庆市12日到14日召开了“六员”会议，出席会议的八百多名商业部门的批发人员、对私改造工作人员、公方代表人员、市场管理人员、税收员和银行贷款员，从揭露出的私商大量投机违法的事实中，受到了一次最深刻最实际的社会主义教育。
    据会上揭发，重庆市违法工商业者和手工业户的投机活动近来不但没有减少，反而呈现逐渐增加的趋势。他们套购和抢购国家统购物资，抬价出售原材料，掺杂掺假，以劣货充好货。有些合营企业的私方人员组织“地下工厂”，以高额工资拉拢在业工人，盗窃国家原材料，进行黑市活动。部分手工业户已发展成为大工场。如缝纫业傅屿夫妻，雇工竟达一百四十多人（现已勒令解散），手工业户黄鉴明从一人自产自销，发展到雇工三十二人，投机商贩的气焰十分嚣张，有的甚至辱骂批发员、殴打公方代表，或集体向国营批发商店无理取闹。
    到会人员反映了国营商业、税务部门、银行和工商行政管理部门工作中的缺点。比如商业部门有些干部在安排小商贩的货源时，片面强调照顾，忽视了改造，过多地把一些畅销商品分配给商贩，安排小商贩的营业额一般过大。税收工作缺乏检查，全市商贩偷漏税款现象很严重，去年以来应征而未征的税款在四十万元左右。人民银行的贷款缺乏严格的审查和控制。工商行政管理部门没有根据市场上新的情况，及时地制订出合理的管理办法，使不法工商业者钻了空子，无照工商户日益增多。此外，有关单位对资本主义投机违法分子处理不及时，应法办的没有法办，应罚款的没有罚款，有的处理得太宽。这些缺点，无形中纵容和助长了资本主义的发展。不少人在会上检查，在全行业公私合营以后，自己对资本主义违法投机活动和小商贩的自发势力认识不足，产生了太平思想，放松甚至放弃了领导和管理，听任资本主义泛滥，表示对资本主义的改造和市场管理工作，今后不仅不应该削弱，而且要大力加强。
    重庆市工商行政管理局、市商业局、合作商业局、城市服务局、税务局、人民银行等单位的负责干部，在会上发言，表示决心根据当前市场新形势，进一步采取有效的经济措施和行政措施，加强市场管理和对工商业者的社会主义改造。
