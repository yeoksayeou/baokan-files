　　Dancer Wu Xiaobang's Performance
    This newspaper reports that yesterday evening, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the China Dance Art Research Association jointly invited dancer Wu Xiaobang and the Tianma Dance Art Studio he leads to hold a performance.
    At the performance, a total of eight programs created by Wu Xiaobang since 1932, including "March of the Volunteers," "Thinking of the Mortal World," "Flames of Hunger," and "Guerrilla Fighters," were performed. These works were performed for the first time in Beijing and were welcomed and praised by the capital's literary and art circles.
    The Tianma Dance Art Studio was established in December last year, and its predecessor was the Xiaobang Dance Art Research Institute before the Anti-Japanese War.
