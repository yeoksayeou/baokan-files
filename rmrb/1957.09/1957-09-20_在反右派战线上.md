　　On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Harboring Evil Intentions, Deliberately Reversing Black and White
    Xiong Shiping Begins to Lower His Head and Confess His Crimes
    The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant exposed the reactionary words and deeds of rightist engineer Xiong Shiping.

    Xiong Shiping had received special agent training from the Kuomintang’s "Military Intelligence Bureau" and worked in the "Military Intelligence Bureau" as a confidential officer. Taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign, he unleashed poisonous arrows, slandering the Party as "a locomotive that doesn't pull the train" and saying that "preventing the people from speaking is more dangerous than blocking a river." He said that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "an absurd and extremely urgent matter." He also collected so-called "living evidence" everywhere to attack the Party. He also arrogantly patted his chest and told people, "I, Old Xiong, am not afraid of anything. If you have any opinions that you dare not raise, give them to me!"

    In the anti-rightist struggle, after the workers' pursuit, Xiong Shiping began to lower his head and confess his crimes.

    Massively Peddling Bourgeois Journalistic Views
    Liu Zengyu is a Class Enemy Within the Party
    The anti-Party crimes of Liu Zengyu, deputy editor-in-chief of the Yunnan Frontier Youth News, have been exposed.

    During the blooming and contending period, Liu Zengyu, using the "Zuo Ye Incident," stirred up trouble in the journalistic circles, demanding that the Party "regard large and small newspapers as 'independent organs of public opinion'" and slandering our country as "having no freedom of the press." He also used the name "Commentator of this Newspaper" to fabricate facts and publish an article "Protesting the Restrictions on Journalists and Discrimination Against Small Newspapers." He also incited the editorial department to "push back" the documents and instructions that the Communist Youth League committee wanted to publish.

    Liu Zengyu came from a reactionary landlord class family. When his landlord mother committed suicide out of fear of punishment and his counter-revolutionary father was arrested, he said, "The Communist Party's arrival has led to 'family ruin and death.'"

　　One Showed His Face, One Commanded From Behind the Scenes
    Zhu Weixin and Tang Xianjun Conspired to Attack the Party
    A right-wing small group once appeared in the Beijing Institute of Water Conservancy Science. The public figure of this small group was Tang Xianjun (engineer), while the actual commander was Zhu Weixin, deputy director of the Soil Engineering Institute.

    Using the pseudonym "Tu Ren" (meaning "earth man"), they posted big-character posters fabricating facts, saying that welfare funds were only for those about to die and not for the living, demanding that democratic parties and the trade union establish a review group, and demanding that the Party General Branch Secretary compensate the welfare funds. In an "Open Letter to Party Members," they said that Party members had a "shrinking disease," attempting to incite Party members to betray the Party and attack it.

    When the masses launched a counterattack against "Tu Ren" at the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, the tail of the backstage commander—Zhu Weixin—was revealed. On the one hand, he clamored that the counterattack against "Tu Ren" was making a mountain out of a molehill, and on the other hand, he directed the "Tu Ren" elements to retreat. He told them to "use silence to overcome sound, and not argue with them (referring to the Party and the masses)," and publicly defended them, saying, "The constitution stipulates that there is freedom of speech and freedom not to speak."

　　在反右派战线上
    存心不善故意颠倒黑白
    熊世平开始低头认罪
    洛阳矿山机器厂揭露了右派分子工程师熊世平的反动言行。
    熊世平曾受过国民党“军统”特务训练，在“军统”特务机关作过机要工作。他趁党整风之际，大放毒箭，诬蔑党是“不拉列车的火车头”，是“防民之口，甚于防川”，说肃反是“荒谬绝伦之亟”。他并且到处搜集所谓“活人活据”的资料向党进攻。他并狂妄地拍胸向人说：“我老熊什么也不怕，你有什么意见不敢提，交给我！”
    在反右派斗争中，经过职工们的追击，熊世平开始低头认罪。
    大量贩卖资产阶级新闻观点
    刘增羽是党内阶级敌对分子
    云南边疆青年报副总编辑刘增羽的反党罪行，已被揭露。
    鸣放期间刘增羽借“左叶事件”，在新闻界中大肆点火，要求党“把大、小报纸看作‘独立的舆论机关’”，诬蔑我们国家“没有新闻自由”。他还用“本报评论员”名义，捏造事实，发表了“抗议对记者的限制和对小报的歧视”的文章。他还煽动编辑部把团委要登的文件指示“顶回去”。
    刘增羽出身于反动地主阶级家庭，他的地主母亲畏罪自杀和反革命父亲被捕时，他说“共产党来了使得‘家破人亡’”。
　　一个抛头露面　一个幕后指挥
    朱维新汤先骏串连向党进攻
    北京水利科学研究院曾出现一个右派小集团。这个小集团的公开出面人是汤先骏（工程师），而实际指挥者却是土工研究所副所长朱维新。
    他们以“土人”为笔名贴出大字报捏造事实说：福利费是救死不救活，要求由民主党派和工会成立审查小组，要党总支书记赔偿福利金。在“给党员一封公开信”里，说党员有“畏缩病”，企图煽动党员叛变，向党进攻。
    反击右派斗争开始，群众向“土人”发起反击的时候，幕后指挥人——朱维新的尾巴露出来了。他一面叫嚣反击“土人”是小题大做，一面则指挥“土人”分子退却。要他们“以无声胜有声，不同他们（指党和群众）争论”，并公开为他们辩护说，“宪法规定，有发言的自由，也有不发言的自由。”
