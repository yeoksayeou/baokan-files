On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　Finding Anti-Communists to Gather and "Pour Out Grievances"
　　Luo Weizhi Actively Sought Out Chen Mingshu
　　Luo Weizhi was a teacher in the Industrial Economics Department of the Beijing Petroleum Institute, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), and a core member of the Chen Mingshu clique. In order to ignite the situation in the education sector, the Chen Mingshu clique gathered people who harbored hatred and dissatisfaction towards the Party to meet at Chen's home, asking everyone to "pour out their grievances." Luo Weizhi actively sought out targets for these meetings and actively planned them, resulting in their writing of the "Ten Thousand Word Letter" that launched a frenzied attack against the Party.
　　In the early stages of the rectification campaign, Luo Weizhi launched a series of poisonous arrows attacking the Party Committee system, political and ideological work in universities, and the Party Committee of the Petroleum Institute. He slandered the Party Committee system as "one-party dictatorship," saying, "The school Party Committee is a thick line, the administration and the Communist Youth League are two thin lines, and the democratic parties, trade unions, and student unions are three dotted lines." He slanderously said, "The teachers' suffering, the people's voices, in the strumming of this thick line, seem to be unheard," and he openly demanded the abolition of the Party Committee system.
　　After the start of the anti-rightist struggle, the faculty, staff, and students of the Petroleum Institute broke through the alliance of Luo Weizhi, Chen Mingshu, and Wang Zhinan (Chen's secretary). After exposing the facts and conducting reasoned struggle, Luo Weizhi had to admit that he was a core member of the Chen Mingshu clique.

　　Are There Really Two "Formulas" in Cadre Policy?
　　It's Just Wang Yingke's Malicious Slander
　　Cadres of the Fuzhou City Construction Bureau in Fujian Province have been gathering for days to expose and refute the reactionary words and deeds of Wang Yingke, the bureau's director and vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.
　　During the rectification movement, Wang Yingke maliciously distorted and slandered the Party's cadre policy. He said that the Party had two different "formulas" for cadres: for Party members, it was: promotion—learning—promotion; for non-Party cadres, it was: criticism—struggle—cleansing. Wang Yingke also sowed discord between the Party and intellectuals, saying that the current "position of intellectuals is very unreasonable" and that "they generally have not received the respect they deserve." He maliciously incited, "Some teachers are teaching classes while being criticized and struggled against by students, engineers are designing under the crude interference of leaders, and doctors are diagnosing under the insults of patients," "while the vast majority of Party members think that after learning three political slogans, they can lead everything."

　　Teachers and Students of Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration
　　Criticize Ma Wanjun and Bian Zhaoxiang
　　Teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of Ma Wanjun, a rightist element and lecturer in the General Geology Teaching and Research Section, and Bian Zhaoxiang, a professor.
　　During the period of great blooming and contending, these two rightist elements were very active. They slandered the Party Committee as a "sectarian clique," "incompetent," and "distorting" policies; they said that the Communist Party "educates Party members with dogmatism," thereby negating the Party's ideological leadership. They also directed their mouthpiece, the "Volcano News," to create a series of incidents such as welfare funds and "nepotism," alienating the relationship between the Party and the masses. Ma Wanjun complacently said: "Now I seem to have returned to the era of fighting against the Kuomintang."
　　Ma Wanjun had joined the Blue Shirts Society. His father was a counter-revolutionary sentenced to eight years of control, and during the blooming and contending period, he clamored to avenge his father. Bian Zhaoxiang was a Kuomintang member and deeply hated the people's democratic dictatorship.

    在反右派战线上
    找反共的人集会“吐苦水”
    罗伟之为陈铭枢到处奔走
    罗伟之是北京石油学院工业经济系教师、民革成员、陈铭枢集团的骨干。陈铭枢集团为了在教育界点火，召集一些对党仇恨和不满的人在陈家中开会，要大家“吐苦水”。罗伟之为这些会议四处奔走物色对象，并积极策划，结果他们写成向党猖狂进攻的“万言书”。
    在整风初期，罗伟之发出一系列毒箭攻击党委制、高等学校政治思想工作和石油学院党委会。他把党委制诬蔑为“一党专政”，他说“学校党委是一条粗线，行政和团是两条细线，民主党派、工会、学生会是三条虚线。”他诬蔑地说，“教师的疾苦，群众的呼声，在这一条粗线的弹唱中，似乎听不到声音”，他公开要求取消党委制。
    反右派斗争开始后，石油学院的师生员工攻破了罗伟之与陈铭枢、王之南（陈的秘书）的攻守同盟。经过揭发事实和说理斗争，罗伟之不得不承认他是陈铭枢集团的骨干。
    干部政策哪有两个“公式”
    只不过是汪盈科的恶毒污蔑
    福建省福州市城市建设局干部连日集会，揭发、驳斥该局局长、农工民主党福建省委副主委汪盈科的反动言行。
    汪盈科在整风运动中，对党的干部政策进行了恶毒的歪曲和污蔑。他说党对干部有二种不同的“公式”，对党员是：提拔—学习—提拔；对非党干部是：批评—斗争—清洗。汪盈科还挑拨党和知识分子的关系，说目前知识分子“所处地位十分不合理”，“一般没有得到应有的尊重”。他恶毒地煽动说：“有的教师在学生批评斗争中上课，工程师在领导粗暴的干涉下设计，医师在病人的侮辱下诊疗”，“而广大党员，却以为学了三句政治口号便什么都能领导”。
    北京地质勘探学院师生
    批判马万钧边兆祥
    北京地质勘探学院师生揭发和批判该院右派分子、普通地质教研室讲师马万钧和教授边兆祥的反动言行。
    在大鸣大放期间，这两个右派分子曾经大肆活动。他们诬蔑党委是“宗派集团”，“无才”，“歪曲”政策；说什么共产党“以教条主义教育党员”，以此否定党的思想领导。他们还指使他们的喉舌“火山报”制造了所谓福利费、“裙带风”等一系列事件，离间党和群众的关系。马万钧得意忘形地说：“现在我好像又回到和国民党斗争的时代”。
    马万钧加入过复兴社。他父亲是个被判管制八年的反革命分子，在鸣放期间，他扬言要为他的父亲报仇。边兆祥是国民党员，刻骨仇视人民民主专政。
