Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 19th: "L'Humanité" published on the 18th the "Appeal to the French People to Strive to End the Algerian War" adopted by the Central Committee of the French Communist Party at its plenary session the previous day.

The appeal to the people pointed out that continuing the war in Algeria would only lead to complete failure and would lead France to disaster. Therefore, it is the most urgent and noble duty of the French people to use all their strength to end the Algerian War. The appeal to the people asked the French people to think about the lessons of Indochina: the result of seven years of war is that the Americans now rule South Vietnam.

The appeal to the people pointed out that American tycoons are planning to establish economic and military rule in the Middle East and even the entire African continent through the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Algerian War is precisely in their interest. The Algerian War is also beneficial to West German revanchists who have never given up the idea of weakening France.

The appeal to the people believes that the draft of the so-called "Basic Law" on Algeria will not be accepted by the Algerian people. It pointed out that the French Communist Party has always believed that the only policy that can end the bloodshed and the only solution that conforms to France's true national interests is: "Abandoning the colonial relationship between France and Algeria and recognizing the Algerian people's right to independence; conducting negotiations between two equal nations in order to establish new relations and special ties between Algeria and France based on the principle of voluntariness and in accordance with each other's interests."

The appeal to the people finally called on Socialists, Communists, and all people who desire peace to unite and take new and powerful actions to strive for peace in Algeria in the weeks from now until the United Nations debates the Algerian issue.

Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: According to TASS, Paris, September 18th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on September 16th and 17th. The meeting listened to and discussed Fex's report "Striving for Peace in Algeria" and Roger's report "The Material Living Conditions of the Working Masses Are Deteriorating."

The Central Plenary Session adopted the "Appeal to the French People" based on Fex's report. The plenary session decided to hold a "National Day for Peace in Algeria" on October 17th.

In addition, the plenary session adopted a resolution on the working class and working farmers striving to meet their economic demands and the tasks of the Communist Party in this regard, based on the report "The Material Living Conditions of the Working Masses Are Deteriorating."

Finally, the plenary session also adopted a statement from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party demanding the release of the descendants of the victims of the former Nazi butcher who were imprisoned for refusing to serve under the command of former Hitler General Speidel.

Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: Paris News: The French National Assembly ended its summer recess two weeks early on the 17th and began a special session to debate the government's economic policy and the so-called "Basic Law" draft for Algeria.

The parliamentary session was held in a tense political atmosphere. The government's economic policies have caused widespread dissatisfaction in the country, and there are also sharp differences within the ruling group on the issue of the Algerian "Basic Law."

The National Assembly's votes on the so-called "Basic Law" draft and economic policies are scheduled to be held on the 28th and 30th of this month, respectively. According to reports, Bouches-Maunoury has decided to treat both votes as votes of confidence, gambling with the fate of the cabinet.

　　法共中央号召法国人民
　　争取结束阿尔及利亚战争
　　主张进行平等谈判放弃法阿殖民关系
    新华社巴黎19日电　“人道报”18日刊登了法国共产党中央委员会在前一天的全体会议上通过的“为争取结束阿尔及利亚战争告法国人民书”。
    告人民书指出，继续在阿尔及利亚进行战争的政策将只能遭到全盘失败，并且把法国导向灾难。因此，用一切力量来结束阿尔及利亚战争是法国人当前最急迫和最崇高的义务。告人民书要求法国人想一想印度支那的教训：七年战争的结果是今天美国人统治了南越。
    告人民书指出，美国大亨正在打算通过“艾森豪威尔主义”而在中东、甚至在整个非洲大陆建立经济和军事统治。阿尔及利亚战争正是对他们有利的。阿尔及利亚战争也有利于从未放弃削弱法国的念头的西德复仇军国主义者。
    告人民书认为关于阿尔及利亚的所谓“根本法”草案是不会为阿尔及利亚人民接受的。它指出，法国共产党一贯认为唯一能够结束流血的政策和唯一符合法国真正民族利益的解决办法是：“放弃法国和阿尔及利亚之间的殖民关系，承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利；在两个平等的民族之间进行谈判以求在阿尔及利亚和法国之间依据自愿原则建立符合彼此利益的新的关系和特殊联系。”
    告人民书最后号召社会党人、共产党人和一切希望和平的人们团结起来，从现在起到联合国辩论阿尔及利亚问题止的数周中，能够采取新的有力行动来争取阿尔及利亚的和平。
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎18日讯：法国共产党中央委员会在9月16、17两日举行了全体会议。会议听取和讨论了费克思的“为实现阿尔及利亚的和平而斗争”的报告和罗歇的“劳动群众物质生活状况在恶化中”的报告。
    中央全会根据费克思的报告通过了“告法国人民书”。全会决定在10月17日举行“全国争取阿尔及利亚和平日”。
    另外，全会根据“劳动群众物质生活状况在恶化中”的报告通过了一个关于工人阶级和劳动农民争取满足自己经济要求和共产党在这方面的任务的决议。
    最后全会还通过了法国共产党中央委员会的声明，要求释放那些由于拒绝在前希特勒将军斯派达尔指挥下服役而被捕入狱的前纳粹屠刀下牺牲者的子孙。
    据新华社18日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会17日提前两星期结束了夏季休假，开始举行特别会议，以便就政府的经济政策和所谓阿尔及利亚“根本法”草案展开辩论。
    议会会议是在紧张的政治气氛中举行的。政府经济政策在国内引起了广泛的不满，而统治集团内部在阿尔及利亚“根本法”问题上也存在着尖锐的分歧。
    国民议会关于所谓“根本法”草案和经济政策的表决预定将在本月28日和30日分别举行。有消息说，布歇—莫努里已经决定把这两次表决都作为信任投票，拿内阁的命运来作赌。
