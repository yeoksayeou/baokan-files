This newspaper reports: The anti-Rightist struggle in Hebei Province has reached a stage of further deepening. The anti-Rightist struggle in Zhangjiakou and Shijiazhuang has expanded to all walks of life. Recently, the number of Rightists exposed at the provincial and municipal levels has more than doubled.

Currently, more than 40,000 workers in Shijiazhuang and Zhangjiakou have actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle, exposing Rightists such as Wang Junyan, Song Tianxiang, Chu Zhuang, Hu Yingguang, Liu Mufeng, Li Ziwen, and Zhang Peihu. In institutions of higher learning, Tangshan Railway Institute has held more than a hundred large and small debate meetings, exposing and refuting the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of Rightist Wang Benzheng, who attempted to establish a "third political party," as well as Rightist ringleaders Sun Zhusheng, Wang Di, and Hu Sidu, who clamored for the implementation of "professors governing the school" and "truth governing the school." After overcoming right-leaning complacency and liberalism, units that previously believed they had no Rightists have also exposed Rightists. For example, Liu Yiting, the full-time deputy secretary of the original Party group of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, is a Rightist within the Party.

Through the tempering of struggle, the people's sense of responsibility to defend the socialist cause has been greatly strengthened. For example, Shi Jiayi, an old professor at Tangshan Railway Institute who was known for his lack of engagement, bravely stepped forward in this movement and boldly refuted Rightist remarks. Cui Jizu, of the Zhangjiakou Cultural Goods Company, was a hidden Rightist who threatened Gao Furu, whom he had tried to win over, saying, "If you expose me, I will drag you down with me to the death." However, the awakened Gao Furu still exposed him, making it impossible for this Rightist, who claimed to be going to the countryside to find "evidence" for Ge Peiqi's reactionary fallacies, to deny it.

    实际斗争加强了群众捍卫社会主义的责任心
    河北各地揭发大批右派分子
    本报讯　河北省反右派斗争已经达到进一步深入的阶段。张家口、石家庄两市反右派斗争扩展到各行各业。最近省、市两级揭露出来的右派分子已经增加一倍多。
    目前，在石家庄、张家口两市已有四万多名职工积极参加了反右派斗争，揭露出来的右派分子有王君彦、宋天祥、楚庄、胡映光、柳木风、李子文、张培瑚等人。在高等学校中，唐山铁道学院已经召开过百余次大小辩论会，揭露和驳斥了企图建立“第三政党”的右派分子王本政，以及叫嚣要实行“教授治校”、“真理治校”的右派头目孙竹生、王抵、胡思杜等人的反党反社会主义言论。在克服右倾麻痹思想和温情主义以后，过去认为没有右派分子的单位也揭发出了右派，如省文联原来党组的专职副书记刘艺亭就是一个党内右派分子。
    经过斗争的锻炼，人民群众捍卫社会主义事业的责任心大大地加强了。如唐山铁道学院素称“铁树不开花”的老教授史家宜，在这次运动中却挺身而出，大胆地驳斥了右派言论。张家口市文化用品公司崔继祖，是一个暗藏的右派分子，他向被他拉拢过的高福如威胁说：“你要揭露我，至死我也要拉个垫背的。”但是觉悟了的高福如还是揭露了他，使得这个声称要下乡为葛佩琦的反动谬论寻找“根据”的右派分子，终于无法抵赖。
