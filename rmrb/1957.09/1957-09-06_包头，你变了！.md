    Baotou, You've Changed!
    Liu Heng
    You, Baotou, that earthen mound of earth, sky, land, and earthy yellow color, now you have changed, changed beyond recognition!
    In your old city, many, many new buildings, red, yellow, gray, and green, have been built, like beautiful flowers. In your northwest, there used to be a vast open space, where people could see as far as they wanted. Now, the new urban area has been established here, with houses standing high and low, and chimneys puffing smoke, blocking people's view. On your construction sites, the long arms of cranes are moving up and down, and the sparks of electric welding are flashing. Everywhere is booming and clanging. Baotou, you are changing every day! Chimneys and houses stand up row by row, growing faster than crops! Leaving home in the morning, you can't find your way back in the afternoon!
    Baotou, you have changed! Even the night is shining.
    Thinking back, people "paid for electricity but lived in the dark." The Kuomintang reactionaries only left seventeen streetlights with ghost-like eyes. People sat in their houses, turned on the electric lights, and still had to light oil lamps (people jokingly called it the "dual-lamp system"). As soon as people stepped out of the door, they were blinded.
    Now, the new thermal power plant is about to be completed, and the old power plant has been expanded again and again. Baotou, you can no longer be lost in the dark! Rows of electric lights have hung necklaces for you, inlaid with lace, and your light shines for dozens of miles, illuminating the eyes of pedestrians.
    Hei Jia Ge Ba (Note 1), you have been "suffering" in the dark for decades, you should be renamed "Guangming Village" (Village of Light)! Because now, electric light shines into your village, and your people can sew and do needlework at night without lighting oil lamps. Electric light shines into your village, so you not only have light during the day, but the whole night is no longer dark.
    Baotou, you have changed! Your Mongolian sons and daughters have increased.
    In the past, the Mongolian sons and daughters who were driven away by the Han rulers have now returned from the mountains, and Mongolian sons and daughters who were not originally yours have also come from all directions to join your embrace.
    They are working as factory directors, managers, workshop directors, and technicians...
    Zhongqun, the girl standing next to the distribution panel, with a flick of your little hand, the whole city lights up. In two years, you have gone from being illiterate to a primary school student. Who is faster than you?
    "It's not that I learn fast, it's that my teacher teaches well."
    "In two years, although I have encountered some difficulties, now that I think about it, it's actually very simple. When I was young, I could tell the difference between my little sheep. When I grew up, of course, I could remember my new characters."
    "When I first opened the book, I looked at it—oh! They were all strangers. I stared at them once, stared at them again, and stared at them again. Slowly, they became my acquaintances."
    Hao Jinshan, the driver sitting in the cab, the car is your house, and the steering wheel is your hand. You drive your car so smoothly and steadily! When you go, there is a bowl of water on the car, and when you come back, there is still a bowl of water on the car. Your technique is really high!
    "No, no! Although I ran first in horse racing when I was young, I still have to learn how to drive a car from the Han elder brothers. Last year, I went to Beijing to attend the advanced producers' conference, and I made up my mind to learn from Ai Zhaochang."
    "I think driving is like riding a horse. You have to have keen eyes, quick hands, and a careful heart. You have to understand the temperaments of the car and the horse, and you have to wipe and wash them frequently. If I treat it well, it will treat me well."
    Saren, the young man with a backpack leaning against the train door, Baotou is just ahead! You are holding your little face tight, looking left and right, scratching your head and stamping your feet, restless. Why are you so anxious?
    "The train is so slow, how can I not be anxious!"
    "My people have shepherds and farmers, but no steelworkers. I am going to live in the Baogang Industrial Technology School!"
    "As soon as I took off my military uniform, I couldn't wait to open up this second front. I never lag behind in riding a horse to kill enemies. If the train arrives a minute earlier, I can conquer one more scientific bunker."
                        ＊
    Baotou, you are the "West Exit" that the famine refugees often talked about.
    Li Liu, the farmer from Shanxi, you carried your nursing baby in a basket, and you held the hand of your eldest daughter, who had learned to walk. Your pregnant woman walked for a while and then "plunked" down on the ground, crying all the way. Now, what are your whole family of six doing sitting on the big cart?
    "We are moving to cultivate land ten miles away."
    This time the move is not as hard and tiring as before, right?
    "Of course, this time the move is not being driven away by famine, but giving land for industrial construction. This time the move does not require our own legs, but has rubber wheels to walk."
    As the old immigrants left, Baotou, you received a large number of new immigrants.
    They came by train, they were loaded by car, and they flew by newly opened planes. They lined up and walked on you in large teams. What they sang was not the elegy of "Walking the West Exit" (Note 2), but the marching song of our country's first Five-Year Plan.
    It is them! It is them! It is them who are charging against the wind and stepping on the sand, cutting ice and breaking snow here, using their hands to change your color and decorate your face.
    They are our construction army—our great Earth sculptors!
    (Note 1) Heijia Ge Ba is the name of a village in the suburbs of Baotou.
    (Note 2) "Walking the West Exit" is a folk tune popular in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia and other places. It sings about the parting of men and women forced by famine.

### 包头，你变了！

    包头，你变了！
    刘衡
    你这个土天土地土黄颜色的土包头啊，现在你已经变了，变得叫人认不出来了。
    在你的旧城，新盖了红的、黄的、灰的、绿的好多好多的楼房，像一朵一朵好看的花。在你的西北，原先是空荡荡的一大片，人们在这里，要看多远，就能看多远。现在这里建立了新市区，高高低低站着的房子，咕咚咕咚吐烟的烟囱，挡住了人们的眼。在你的工地，起重机的长手在一上一下地动，电焊的火光在忽闪忽闪地亮。到处轰隆轰隆，叮叮噹噹。包头，你一天变个模样！烟囱、房子一排排站起来，比庄稼还长得快哟！清早出门，下午就找不见回家的路了！
    包头，你变了！变得黑夜也在发光。
    想从前，人们“出了电灯钱，住在黑地里”。国民党反动派只留下鬼?眼的路灯十七盏。人们坐在屋里，开了电灯，还要点油灯（人们戏称为“双灯制”）。人们一出大门，立刻瞎了眼。
    到如今，新的热电站快要盖好，旧的发电厂扩建了又扩建。包头，在黑夜不再找不见你啦！成排的电灯给你挂了项炼，镶上花边，你的光射了几十里路，照着走路人眼。
    黑家圪巴（注一），你在黑暗里“窝囊”了几十年，你应该改叫“光明村”啦！因为现在，电光照进你的村子，你的人晚上不点油灯，也能穿针做活。电光照进你的村子，你不光白天有亮，整个黑夜也不黑。
    包头，你变了！你的蒙族儿女变多了。
    过去你的被汉族统治者赶走的蒙古族儿女已经下山归来，过去不是你的蒙古族儿女也从四面八方赶来投进你的怀抱。
    他们在做厂长、经理、车间主任、技术工人……
    站在配电盘旁边的姑娘忠群，你的小手一动，全城唰地一亮。两年功夫，你从一字不识变成高小学生，有谁比你还快？
    “不是我学的快，是我的先生教的好。”
    “两年啊，我虽然碰到好些困难。现在想想，其实也很简单。我小的时候，既然分得清我的小羊。我长大了，当然记得住我的生字。
    “原先我打开书本，一看——呀！个个都是生面孔。我就朝它盯一眼，盯一眼，再盯一眼，慢慢，它就变成我的熟人。”
    坐在驾驶室里的司机郝金山，汽车是你的房子，方向盘是你的手。你的车子开得好平好稳啊！去时车上放了一碗水，回来车上还有一碗水，你的技术真高！
    “哪里！哪里！小时候赛马我虽然跑过第一，至于开汽车还得向汉族老大哥学习。去年我到北京开了先进生产者大会，就下定决心要向艾肇昌看齐。
    “我看开车就同骑马一样，要眼明手快心细，要摸清车跟马的脾气，还要勤擦勤洗。我对它好，它也就对我好。”
    背着背包、靠在火车门口的青年萨仁，包头前边就到！你绷着小脸，左看右看，抓头跌脚，坐立不安，你为什么那样心急？
    “火车这样慢，叫我怎不急！”
    “我的民族有放羊的，种地的，还没有炼钢工人，我这就去住包钢工业技术学校！”
    “我一脱掉军服，恨不得马上开到这第二条战线。骑在马上砍杀敌人我从不落后，火车早到一分钟，我就可以多攻破一座科学碉堡。”
                        ＊
    包头，你就是以前逃荒人常说的“西口”。
    那从山西来的农民李六，你把你吃奶的小儿子挑在箩筐里，你把你学会走路了的大女儿牵在手上。你大肚子的女人走一走，“扑通”坐在地上，哭了一路。现在，你们全家六口坐在大车上面干什么？
    “我们在搬家，到十里路外去种地。”
    这回搬家不像以前那样苦、那样累了吧？
    “当然啰，这回搬家，不是被饥荒赶跑，是给工业建设让地。这回搬家，不用自己的腿，有胶皮轱辘走路。”
    旧的移民刚走，包头，你又来了大批新的移民。
    他们用火车开了来，用汽车装了来，用刚刚通航的飞机飞了来。他们排着队，大队大队地在你身上走。他们嘴里唱的不是“走西口”（注二）的悲调，而是咱们祖国第一个五年计划的进行曲。
    就是他们！就是他们！就是他们在你这里冲风踏砂、斩冰破雪，用他们的双手改变了你的颜色，装饰了你的脸。
    他们就是我们的建筑大军——我们伟大的地球雕刻家！
    （注一）黑家圪巴是包头郊区的一个村名。
    （注二）“走西口”是流传在山西、陕西、内蒙古等地的一个小调。唱的是因灾荒逼迫的男女离情。
