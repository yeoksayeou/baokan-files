Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 10th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Zhi'an reports: After five years of geological survey work, nearly 100 oil-bearing structures and dozens of metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits have been found on the Qinghai Plateau, a geological blank area.

Many geological and petroleum experts from China and Soviet experts, after working and inspecting this plateau, believe that this is a very valuable reserve industrial base.

The Qinghai Plateau is composed of the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains and the southern slope of the Qilian Mountains, with an altitude of more than 3,000 meters. The geological structure is extremely complex, which is conducive to the formation of various minerals. So far, in terms of oil exploration, many well-closed and complete dome anticline structures have been found. Among the more than 100 wells drilled on dozens of structures, 63 wells have already gushed oil, encountered oil sand, or shown oil and gas; at the same time, different types of shallow and deep oil reservoirs have been discovered in many places, and four shallow oil fields have been confirmed to have industrial value. In addition to oil, more than 30 lead, copper, antimony and other mineral deposits have been discovered successively. The Xitieshan lead-zinc mine discovered in Qaidam has good grade and large reserves. Several precious metal mines such as gold and platinum discovered in Yewogou and Tangnaihai areas, of which two have been proven to be industrial-value deposits. Iron, chromium, manganese and other minerals used in the steel industry have been discovered in twelve places. The abundance of coal deposits has exceeded people's predictions. The four coal belts that have been discovered and surveyed have 16 mining points; among them, the Muli coal field is more than 100 kilometers long from east to west. Last year, a high-quality crystal mine was found in Tanggula Mountain, which is more than 5,000 meters above sea level. The salt reserves in the salt lakes are also very rich. The reserves of the three salt lakes, Chaka, Keke, and Charkhan, alone are 26.7 billion tons.

　　青海高原
　　——非常有价值的后备工业基地
　　已经找到了近百个储油构造几十种矿藏
    据新华社西宁10日电　新华社记者李治安报道：经过五年来的地质勘测工作，在地质空白区的青海高原，已经找到了近百个储油构造和数十种金属和非金属的矿藏。
    我国不少地质石油专家及苏联专家在这个高原工作和视察后认为，这里是一个非常有价值的后备工业基地。
    青海高原是由昆仑山北坡和祁连山南坡所组成，海拔在三千公尺以上，地质构造极为复杂，有利于生成多种矿产。到目前为止，在石油勘探方面，已经找到了许多闭合良好、形式完整的穹窿背斜构造。在数十个构造上的一百多口钻井中，有六十三口井已经喷出石油、遇到油砂或有油气显示；同时，发现了不同类型的浅油藏和深油藏多处，有四个浅层油田已肯定具有工业价值。除了石油以外，还先后发现三十多处铅、铜、锑等矿产。在柴达木所发现的锡铁山铅锌矿，品位既好、储量又多。在野牛沟及唐乃亥一带发现的好几处金、铂等贵金属矿，其中两处证明是有工业价值的矿床。作为炼钢工业的铁、铬、锰等矿产，已在十二处发现。煤藏的丰富超过了人们的预测。经发现勘测的四条煤带，有矿点十六处；其中木里煤田东西长达一百多公里。在拔海五千多公尺的唐古拉山，去年找到了质量很高的水晶矿。盐湖的储盐量也十分丰富，仅茶卡、柯柯、察尔汗三个盐湖的储量就有二百六十七亿吨。
