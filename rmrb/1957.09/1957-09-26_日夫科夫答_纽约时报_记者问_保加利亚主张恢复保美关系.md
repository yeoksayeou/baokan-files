Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 25th: The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported that the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Zhivkov, answered questions raised by "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger.

When discussing the relationship between Bulgaria and the United States, Zhivkov pointed out that the Bulgarian government had repeatedly and formally expressed its desire to restore diplomatic relations with the United States, but had not received a positive response. He said, "We believe that the possibility of developing economic and cultural relations between the two countries exists. Today, Bulgaria is a country with rapid economic development. This greatly expands its import and export possibilities."

In answering questions about Bulgaria's relations with neighboring countries, Zhivkov emphasized that Bulgaria hopes to maintain normal and friendly relations with all peace-loving countries, especially its neighbors, both near and far.

Zhivkov continued, "Our relations with Yugoslavia are developing continuously, just like the relations between two socialist countries. The Bulgarian government is also constantly striving to establish friendly and good-neighborly relations with Greece and Turkey. The Bulgarian government believes that, despite the different socio-political systems between Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey, it is possible to establish relations of mutual understanding and cooperation."

Zhivkov said, "We are willing to legally fix the peaceful coexistence of the Balkan countries by concluding collective agreements and bilateral agreements, or any other appropriate form that can practically embody the principles of the United Nations Charter."

The Bulgarian government welcomes and is willing to accept Romania's proposal to hold a meeting of the heads of government of the Balkan countries.

Zhivkov then spoke about the path to socialism. He said, "We believe that, apart from the path opened up by the Great October Socialist Revolution, which the Soviet people have confidently and victoriously followed for forty years, there cannot be another fundamentally different path of socialist construction. The main laws of socialist construction are the same for all countries."

Zhivkov said: "For the Bulgarian Communists and the Bulgarian people, the experience of the Soviet Union, the first country to achieve socialist victory, which has worldwide historical significance, is of paramount importance. We want to learn from this experience and strive to creatively apply this experience in combination with our country's specific conditions. Of course, we must also pay attention to learning and adopting the good experiences of the people's democratic countries, because they each have their own contributions to the theory and practice of socialism."

    日夫科夫答“纽约时报”记者问
    保加利亚主张恢复保美关系
    据新华社索非亚25日电　保加利亚通讯社报道了保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫回答“纽约时报”记者沙尔斯堡所提的问题。
    日夫科夫在谈到保美两国的关系问题时指出，保加利亚政府曾多次正式表示过自己想同美国恢复外交关系的愿望，但是没有得到积极的结果。他说，我们认为，发展两国间的经济和文化关系的可能性是存在的。今天保加利亚是经济迅速发展的国家。这就大大地扩大着它的进出口的可能性。
    在回答保加利亚同邻国关系问题时，日夫科夫强调指出，保加利亚希望同远近所有爱好和平的国家，首先是同自己的邻国保持正常的友好关系。
    日夫科夫接着说，我们同南斯拉夫的关系正像两个社会主义国家的关系那样不断地发展。保加利亚政府还在不断地努力同希腊和土耳其建立友好的睦邻关系。保加利亚政府认为，尽管保加利亚、希腊和土耳其三国间的社会政治制度不同，但是建立互相谅解和合作的关系是可能的。
    日夫科夫说，我们愿意用法律形式把巴尔干各国的和平共处固定下来，办法是缔结集体协定和双边协定，或是任何其他能够实际体现联合国宪章原则的适当形式。
    保加利亚政府欢迎，并且愿意接受罗马尼亚提出的关于举行巴尔干国家政府首脑会议的建议。
    日夫科夫随后谈到走向社会主义的道路问题。他说：“我们认为，除了苏联人民四十年来满怀信心地胜利地沿着伟大十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路外，不可能存在另一种根本不同的社会主义建设道路。社会主义建设的主要规律对一切国家说来都是相同的。”
    日夫科夫说：对保加利亚共产党人和保加利亚人民来说，第一个取得社会主义胜利的国家苏联的全世界历史意义的经验具有头等重要的意义。我们要学习这种经验，并且努力结合本国的具体条件创造性地运用这种经验。当然，我们也要注意学习和采用各人民民主国家的良好经验，因为它们对社会主义的理论和实践各有各的贡献。
