Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 5th: A level six gale is violently attacking the Harbin levee along with an extremely large flood peak. At 7:00 PM today, the river water level had risen to 120.28 meters, an increase of eight centimeters compared to yesterday.

From 1:00 PM today, three serious dangers such as levee collapse successively occurred on the suburban farmland levee. The City Flood Control Headquarters immediately ordered four motorized rescue boats fully loaded with mud to rush to the rescue, and sent thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers and workers to provide support. Ren Zhongyi, First Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Secretary Lin Xiaokui, General Commander of the Flood Control Headquarters and Mayor Lü Qien, braved the wind and waves to board ships to inspect and guide the rescue efforts, finally managing to avert these dangers.

Due to the pressure of the high water level flood, more than twenty instances of seepage and slope failure occurred on the urban levee, but after timely handling by rescue personnel, no major dangers formed, and the levees at each location remained safe and sound.

Today, the 170,000 soldiers and civilians engaged in flood control are watching the arrival of the flood peak and risks with high vigilance. After more than ten days of hard work, the critical levees in the urban area are all about two meters higher than the current water level, and the wave-dissipating facilities in front of many levees have also been strengthened. The carefully selected rescue team members are living in tents next to the levee, ready to be dispatched for rescue at any time.

    哈尔滨水位继续上涨
    防汛人员和险情进行英勇斗争
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　六级大风卷着特大的洪峰正猛烈袭击哈尔滨大堤。今天下午七时，江面水位已上涨到一二○·二八公尺，比昨天上涨了八公分。
    今天下午一时起，郊区农田大堤先后发生了堤身塌陷等三处严重险情，市防汛指挥部立即命令四条满载泥土的机动抢险船开往抢救，并派出解放军和工人数千人前往支援。中共哈尔滨市委第一书记任仲夷、书记林肖硖、防汛指挥部总指挥、市长吕其恩等都冒着风浪乘船前往检查和指导抢救，终于使这些险情得以挽救。
    市区大堤由于高水位洪水的压力，发生了二十多处浸水和脱坡现象，但经抢险人员及时处理，都没有形成大险，各处堤坝仍然安全无事。
    今天防汛的十七万军民以高度警惕性注视着洪峰和风险的到来。他们经十多天的艰苦劳动，市区险要的堤坝都高出当前水位二公尺左右，许多堤坝前沿的防浪设施也加强了。经过挑选的抢险队员，都住在堤坝旁的帐篷里，准备随时出动抢险。
