    Shandong Develops Small Coal Mines
    (Our report) Shandong Province has decided to build thirteen new coal mines this year. The annual output of each mine is generally around 15,000 to 40,000 tons. After all the mines are completed, they will increase coal production by more than 240,000 tons annually.
    Those with generally larger reserves, wider mine areas, and better mining conditions, suitable for local industrial exploitation, are invested in by the state.
    Those with smaller mining areas, simpler mining conditions, less investment, faster coal production, and shorter mining times, suitable for community operation, are generally organized by agricultural cooperatives. These small coal mines require less investment and have lower costs. For example, the Pingnantou small coal mine in Linqu only requires an investment of more than 5,000 yuan and can be put into production in a short period, with a daily output of about ten tons and a cost of only about ten yuan per ton.

    山东发展小煤窑
    本报讯　山东省确定在今年新建十三处煤矿。各矿的年产量一般在一万五千吨至四万吨左右。全部矿井建成后，每年能增加煤炭二十四万多吨。
    一般储量较大，矿井范围宽广，开采条件较好，适合地方工业开采的，都由国家投资。
    矿区范围小，开采条件简易，投资少，出煤快，开采时间短，适宜于民办的，一般由农业社筹办。这种小煤窑，投资少、成本低，如临朐平南头小煤窑，投资只要五千多元，在短时间内即可投入生产，日产十吨左右，每吨成本只有十元左右。
