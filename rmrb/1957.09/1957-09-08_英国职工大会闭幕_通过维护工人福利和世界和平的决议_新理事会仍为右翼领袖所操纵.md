    (Special dispatch from our correspondent in Blackpool, September 6) The annual British Trades Union Congress (TUC), after five days of meetings, closed today. The congress passed some relatively good resolutions. Some delegates made powerful criticisms of the Conservative government's policies.
    Among the resolutions unanimously adopted at the congress, one demanded that wages be adjusted in accordance with rising prices. The congress resolution also demanded that the Labour government, once in power, abolish the Conservative government's law abolishing rent control. The congress demanded an increase in pensions and expressed its intention to support retired old workers with action.
    The discussion on the issue of nationalization reflected the dissatisfaction of trade union members with the Labour Party's new draft program of "public ownership." The congress's resolution pointed out that the council had not completed the task of expanding nationalization as proposed by the TUC annual conferences of 1952 and 1953, and instructed the council to negotiate with the Labour Party on this issue. This sentiment of the delegates led the Labour Party leader Gaitskell, on the pretext of "attending a banquet," to rush to Blackpool to conduct behind-the-scenes activities in an attempt to reduce the annual meeting's resistance to Labour Party policy.
    When the annual meeting discussed international issues, speakers repeatedly emphasized that pursuing a policy of atomic war was a criminal and suicidal policy, demanded an immediate and unconditional cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and condemned the rigid stance of Western countries on this issue.
    Speakers also pointed out that the policy of not recognizing and excluding China from the United Nations was foolish and unrealistic.
    The congress also passed a resolution calling for the establishment of European collective security.
    During the discussion on the European Free Trade Area, speakers expressed deep concern about this issue.
    However, the annual meeting also passed the council's report, which was substantially different from the above resolutions. During the meeting, the council also used its power to force individual trade unions to withdraw proposals that it strongly opposed.
    The newly elected council, in addition to the four newly elected right-wing trade union leaders, are all the same old faces. Communist members were excluded.

    英国职工大会闭幕
    通过维护工人福利和世界和平的决议
    新理事会仍为右翼领袖所操纵
    本报布莱克浦6日专电　一年一度的英国职大年会，经过五天的会议，已于今日闭幕。大会通过了一些较好的决议。有些代表对保守党政府的政策作了有力的抨击。
    在大会一致通过的决议案中，要求工资应随物价的上涨而作调整。大会决议还要求工党政府上台后废除保守党政府的取消房租管制法案。大会要求增加养老金，并表示将以行动来支持退休的老工人。
    对国有化问题的讨论，反映了工会会员对工党的新的“公有化”纲领草案的不满。大会的决议指出，理事会没有完成1952、1953年职大年会所提出的扩大国有化的任务，并责成理事会就此问题和工党谈判。代表们的这种情绪，使得工党领袖盖次克尔借口“参加宴会”赶到布莱克浦，进行幕后活动，力求减少年会对工党政策的抵触。
    年会在讨论到国际问题时，发言者一再强调奉行原子战争政策是罪恶的自杀政策，要求立即无条件停止试验核武器，并且谴责西方国家在这一问题上的僵硬立场。
    发言者也指出，不承认和排斥中国在联合国之外的政策是愚蠢的和不现实的。
    大会还通过了要求建立欧洲集体安全的决议。
    在讨论欧洲自由贸易区时，发言者对这一问题表示深刻不安。
    但是，年会也同样地通过了理事会的报告，这个报告在实质上与上述决议截然相异。会议期间，理事会还运用权力，迫使个别工会撤销了为它所坚决反对的提案。
    新选出的理事会，除了新选上的四个右翼工会领袖外，其余的全是原班人马。属于共产党的会员遭到了排斥。
