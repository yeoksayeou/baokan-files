    Rebutting "Ode to the Gale"
    Gōng Liú

    The lyric poem "Ode to the Gale" (written by Zhāng Xiánliàng), published in the July issue of "Yán Hé," is a work that doubts and curses socialist society and is filled with hostility. The author's postscript and letter to the editorial department, published as a supplement in the August issue of "Yán Hé," further confirm this judgment.

    Let us first quote some sentences. "I blow away the darkness like drifting clouds," "I... bury all the decadent things in the tomb," "I awaken the sleeping animals," "I set the stagnant things in motion," "This aging land was originally a desolate yellow, but I blew it into lush green, full of vitality," "The torrent I create will sweep away everything," "I want to destroy everything and make everything new again," "I call out to everything, I challenge the gods," "I am invincible, I am unstoppable, I am everything," "If I don't become a traitor in that vulgar, worldly, bureaucratic circle, how can I be like you at all," "I want to be the foremost force in your mighty airflow," "I am the first to come into contact in all terrible places."... and so on. Although the entire poem is divided into two parts (the first part is the personification of the gale, and the second part is "I in the Gale"), it is not wrong to regard both the personified gale and the "I in the Gale" as the author himself, as the author himself openly admits: "You have become me, I have become you."

    The author had ideological preparation for writing this poem. He said he hoped his poem could "stimulate the emotions of some young friends," and these young friends, including those "thousands who are called activists" "and a large number of them are Party members and Youth League members," are precisely those whom the author has observed for a long time. He believes that "they suffer from thought anemia, spiritual paralysis, faith weakness, and mental laziness," and therefore, they must be shocked and awakened by a hurricane or a Category 12 typhoon. He further appealed: "We can no longer sing lullabies, we can no longer comfort ourselves, we can no longer be satisfied with the status quo!" He opposes "poems filled with that kind of 'confident optimism'," and he judges them to be "preaching poems," that is, "covering fresh blood with flowers." He declared in an arrogant tone that "people with life experience do not like to read" this kind of "preaching poems," but in another place he complained that he "cannot have any other life content besides classroom textbook assignments and meetings"; obviously, he "does not like to read" "preaching poems," but where is his life then? At this point, the problem is very clear: the reason why he and the so-called "people with life experience" "do not like to read" "preaching poems" is not because of our life, but because he and the so-called "people with life experience" hold an anti-people, anti-socialist, and anti-Party stance!

    Because of the different positions, this Zhāng Xiánliàng dares to propose what "a new era has arrived," and declares that "this era brings a series of negations!"

    What does Zhāng Xiánliàng want to "negate"? In a word, everything that our people affirm, he wants to "negate"!

    When the evil wind blows, there are even people who defend it, saying that what "Ode to the Gale" expresses is nothing more than the fanaticism and nihilism of the petty bourgeoisie. May I ask, what kind of attitude does the author of "Ode to the Gale" take towards the errors and shortcomings in our work? May I ask, what will defending Zhāng Xiánliàng's "Ode to the Gale" lead to in terms of affirming and negating?

    Who says "poems have no definitive interpretation"?!

    斥“大风歌”
    公刘
    发表在“延河”七月号上的抒情诗“大风歌”（张贤亮作），是一篇怀疑和诅咒社会主义社会，充满了敌意的作品。八月号的“延河”补行刊登的作者写的后记和给编辑部的信，更加证实了这种判断。
    我们先来摘引一些句子。“我把阴暗像流云似的吹飞”，“我……把一切腐朽的东西埋进坟墓”，“我把昏睡的动物吹醒”，“我把呆滞的东西吹动”，“这衰老的大地本是一片枯黄，却被我吹得到处碧绿、生气洋洋”，“我创造的洪流将席卷一切而去”，“我要破坏一切而又使一切新生”，“我向一切呼唤、我向神明挑战”，“我是无敌的、我是所向披靡的，我是一切”，“如果我不在那庸俗的、世故的，官僚的圈子里做个叛徒，我又能哪点像你”，“我要在你浩荡的气流里做最前的一股”，“在一切可怕的地方我最先接触”。……等等。全诗虽然分作两部分，（第一部分是大风的拟人化，第二部分是“我在大风中”）但，诚如作者自己公然承认的：“你已化成了我、我已化成了你”。我们把这个拟人化了的大风和在大风中的我，都看作是作者本人，不能说是冤枉。
    作者写这首诗是有思想准备的。他说他希望他的诗能“激发一些青年朋友的感情”，而这些青年朋友，包括那“成千个被称为是积极分子的人”“而且很大部分是党员、团员”，都正是被作者长期观察过的。他认为：“他们患了思想贫血症、精神麻痹症、信仰软弱症、头脑慵懒症”，因而，必须以狂飙或十二级台风来使他们震惊、苏醒。他又进而号召：“我们不能再唱催眠曲了，我们不能再安慰自己了，我们不能再满足现状了”！他反对“满纸充满着那样的‘自信乐观’的诗”，他判定那是“传道诗”，那是“用鲜花盖着鲜血”。他以狂妄的语气宣布，“有生活经验的人不爱看”这种“传道诗”，但他在另一处又诉说自己“除了课堂教材作业开会外，再不能有旁的生活内容”；显然，他是“不爱看”“传道诗”的，但他的生活又何在呢？至此，问题十分清楚，他以及所谓“有生活经验的人”之所以“不爱看”“传道诗”，原因并不在于我们的生活，而是在于他以及所谓“有生活经验的人”持的是反人民反社会主义反党的立场！
    由于立场不同，这个张贤亮才敢于提出什么“新的时代来临了”，并且声言“这个时代带来了一连串否定”！
    张贤亮要“否定”什么？一句话，我们人民所肯定的，他都要“否定”！
    邪风吹来，竟然还有人为之辩解，说“大风歌”所表现的不过是小资产阶级的狂热与虚无。试问，“大风歌”的作者对我们工作中的错误和缺点，究竟是采取了一种什么样的态度？试问，为张贤亮的“大风歌”辩解，又将导向肯定什么和否定什么？
    谁说“诗无达诂”？！
