Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 2nd: The Huainan area of Anhui Province has begun two large-scale reconstruction projects. One is to reconstruct the Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine in Huainan into one of the largest mines in the country, and the other is to reconstruct the entire Huainan Railway into a trunk line capable of running heavy-duty locomotives. These two projects began reconstruction and surveying work in August, respectively.

The Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine was originally a very small mine before liberation, with an annual output of only more than 150,000 tons of coal. After continuous reconstruction after liberation, the annual output has reached 1.2 million tons in the past two years. Because the coalfield here is large and has abundant reserves, further large-scale reconstruction has recently begun - excavating a 2,200-meter-long roadway from the underground of the original mine to mine coal. It utilizes some of the existing mines, and the investment is half less than opening a pair of mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons in a new mining area, but the output can be increased to an annual output of 2.5 million tons.

The Huainan Railway will be fully constructed next year. The Huainan Railway connects the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and is 268 kilometers long. At present, there are dozens of types of light rails and dozens of light bridges on this line. After the reconstruction, all of them will be replaced with heavy-duty rails and changed to permanent reinforced concrete bridges that meet the national first-class railway trunk line standards, so that the entire line will be a line with gentle bends and slopes, and can still safely run during floods. The transport volume will gradually increase to three times its current volume.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 2nd: The main factory building project of the large-scale Huainan Xieji集 Central Coal Preparation Plant officially started construction on the morning of the 1st. After the coal preparation plant is completed, the coking coal concentrate washed out can continuously supply the needs of the steel industries in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Ma'anshan.

The Xieji集 Central Coal Preparation Plant is being built with the help of the Soviet Union. This is a factory with a high degree of mechanization and automation. Without long-distance control devices, production is commanded by using buttons. The main factory building and the various components of the ground industrial square are connected by transportation corridors and conveyors. The entire process from transporting raw coal from the coal receiving pit to the main factory building, through crushing, classification, washing, drying, and finally loading the finished product, is mechanized.

The start of construction of the main factory building now marks the entry of the coal preparation plant's construction project into a stage of full-scale construction. Together with several ancillary production system projects that were constructed earlier, it forms a magnificent construction scene.

### 淮南三大建设  扩大煤井  改建铁路  兴修选煤厂

    淮南三大建设
    扩大煤井  改建铁路  兴修选煤厂
    本报合肥2日电  安徽淮南地区开始进行两个规模巨大的改建工程，一个是将淮南新庄孜煤矿改建成为全国最大的矿井之一，另一个是将淮南铁路全线改建成为能够行驶重型机车的干道。这两个工程已于8月份分别开始改建和勘测工作。
    新庄孜煤矿在解放前原是一个非常小的矿井，年产量仅有十五万多吨煤。解放后经过不断的改建，近两年年产量已达一百二十万吨。由于这里煤田大、蕴藏量多，最近又开始了进一步的大改建——从原矿井的地下开拓一条二千二百公尺的巷道开采煤炭。它利用现有的一部分矿井，投资比在新的井田上开一对年产六十万吨的矿井少一半，产量却可提高到年产二百五十万吨。
    淮南铁路将在明年全面施工。淮南铁路连接长江淮河，长二百六十八公里。目前这条线路上有数十种类型的轻便钢轨，有数十座轻便桥梁。改建后，将全部换成重型钢轨和改为合乎全国一级铁路干线标准的钢骨水泥永久性桥梁，使全线成为弯路和缓、坡度平整和在大水期间仍能安全行车的线路。运输量将逐渐提高到现在的三倍。
    新华社合肥2日电  规模很大的淮南谢家集中央选煤厂主厂房工程，在1日上午正式动工兴建。这座选煤厂建成以后，洗选出来的炼焦精煤可以源源供应武汉、上海和马鞍山等地钢铁工业的需要。
    谢家集中央选煤厂是苏联帮助我国建设的。这是一座机械化、自动化程度很高的工厂，没有远距离操纵装置，使用电钮来指挥生产。主厂房和地面工业广场各组成部分，都有运输走廊和运输机相连，从受煤坑把原煤运往主厂房，经过破碎、分级、水洗、烘干直到成品装车的全部过程，都是机械化的。
    现在主厂房工程的开工，使选煤厂的建设工程进入了全面施工阶段，它与先期施工的几座附属生产系统工程，共同组成了一幅宏伟的施工场面。
