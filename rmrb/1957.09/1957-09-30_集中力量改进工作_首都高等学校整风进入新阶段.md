Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The focus of the rectification campaign in Beijing universities has entered the stage of improving work.

Currently, universities are re-organizing the correct and well-intentioned criticisms made by teachers and students during the "Big Blooming and Contending" period. They are conscientiously addressing each point, publishing the solutions, and engaging the masses in discussions during the process. The Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration has printed and distributed all of the over three hundred suggestions made by the masses, including the one hundred and fifty plus that have already been resolved, to teachers and students for discussion.

In the "Big Blooming and Contending," teachers and students raised criticisms and suggestions regarding the leadership of the schools. Some of these issues were addressed during the previous stage of the anti-rightist struggle, such as cadres receiving excessive subsidies, having high salary grades, and specific issues related to welfare. Some problems in teaching and scientific research have also been dealt with. For example, some schools whose major enrollment numbers were not aligned with national planning needs have already assisted those students in transferring to other majors at the beginning of the new academic year. The State Council has also resolved the problem of the lack of teachers and teaching facilities at the Chinese Medicine College. However, a significant portion of the opinions raised by teachers and students were not addressed because the task of the anti-rightist struggle was more urgent in the previous period. The universities have decided to concentrate their main efforts from late September onwards on rectifying the leadership style, improving all aspects of work, and carrying out socialist ideological education.

    集中力量改进工作
    首都高等学校整风进入新阶段
    据新华社28日讯　首都高等学校的整风运动的重点已进入改进工作阶段。
    现在各校正在把教师和学生在大鸣大放中所提出的正确的和善意的批评重新加以整理，认真地逐条处理逐条公布，并且在处理时发动群众讨论。北京地质勘探学院已把群众所提出的三百多条意见，包括已经解决的一百五十多条意见，全部印发给教师和学生进行讨论。
    各校师生在大鸣大放中，对学校领导干部提出的批评和建议中，有一些问题在前一阶段反右派斗争的同时已经作了处理，如有些干部多领补助费、工资级别评高了以及生活福利方面的一些具体问题等。而教学和科学研究方面的有些问题，也有一些作了处理。如有些学校的专业招收的学生人数和国家计划需要不相适应的，在新学年开学时，都已帮助这些学生转了学。中医医学院缺乏师资和教学房屋的问题，也已由国务院解决。但教师和学生所提的意见中，有很大一部分因为前一时期反右派斗争的任务迫不及待，因而没有来得及处理。各校已决定从9月下旬开始集中主要力量来整顿领导作风改进各方面的工作，并开展社会主义思想教育。
