Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 31st (Reporter Zhou Li):

    In the past eight years, the national average of 600 million people has been able to obtain 41 feet of cotton cloth, one pair of rubber shoes for every two people, one gold pen and one flashlight for every ten people from Shanghai; forty to fifty million families have been able to get a thermos bottle and a washbasin each from Shanghai.
    The Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 31st (Reporter Zhou Li) reported: The consumer goods that the people of the country now obtain from Shanghai are 1.8 times more than eight years ago. In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, Shanghai's consumer goods production increased by an average of 12.6% per year.
    In the past eight years, the quantity of daily necessities provided by Shanghai to the people of the country has been considerable.
    If distributed equally among 600 million people, each person would be able to obtain 41 feet of cotton cloth, one pair of rubber shoes for every two people, and one gold pen and one flashlight for every ten people. If each family used a thermos bottle and a washbasin, the thermos bottles and washbasins produced in Shanghai could meet the needs of 40 to 50 million families.
    Shanghai's various consumer goods industries, most of which have a history of 40 to 50 years, have only achieved unprecedented development since liberation. In the past eight years, light industry has increased by 2.8 times, and the cotton textile industry, which originally had the best foundation, has also increased by 1.3 times; the rubber industry, with a history of 40 years, could only produce 30 million pairs of rubber shoes annually in its first 31 years, but this year it has risen to 65 million pairs; the paper industry, with an even longer history, has increased its paper production by more than five times this year compared to 1949; industries such as cigarettes, soap, grease, and gold pens, which had relatively large production scales in the past, have increased their production by one to four or five times respectively.
    In the past eight years, more than 10,000 new styles and varieties of consumer goods have appeared in Shanghai; many of them were designed to meet the needs of farmers whose living standards are rising. Farmers reported that the old thermos bottles were not suitable for working in the fields, as they did not hold much water and were easily knocked over, so Shanghai's thermos bottle factory trial-produced an eight-pound short and stout thermos bottle, which was welcomed by the farmers. Many new medicines, pens, children's toys, and record players are inexpensive and of good quality, adapting to the purchasing power of the countryside. Some industries that have never made daily necessities for fraternal ethnic minorities have trial-produced many enamel products, hand-cranked sewing machines, and leather shoes for dancing that are suitable for their lifestyles in recent years. Industries such as gold pens, radios, records, projectors, and sporting goods have also launched many new styles and varieties every year.
    Many high-end products have also appeared in Shanghai in recent years. The pharmaceutical industry has added many important drugs such as isoniazid and nicotinic acid, as well as dozens of raw materials with high technical requirements. After our country's first antibiotic factory appeared here, it can now produce two types of antibiotics, penicillin and aureomycin. The domestic watches that people have longed for for many years were successfully trial-produced the year before last, and a factory is currently being built. Industries such as radios and pianos, which used to be mainly engaged in repairs, have now become industrial sectors capable of independent manufacturing, and the pianos they manufacture are also sold overseas.

    上海提供了多少消费品？
    八年来，全国六亿人口平均每人能从上海得到四十一尺棉布，每两个人有一双胶鞋，每十个人有一支金笔和一个手电筒；有四、五千万个家庭能够从上海各得到一个热水瓶和一个洗脸盆。
    据新华社上海31日电  新华社记者周立报道：现在全国人民从上海得到的消费品比八年前多了一点八倍。第一个五年计划的前四年，上海消费品生产每年平均增长12.6％。
    在过去的八年内，上海提供给全国人民的生活用品数量十分可观。
    如果以六亿人口来平均分配，每人能够得到四十一尺棉布，每两个人有一双胶鞋，每十个人有一支金笔和一个手电筒。假使每个家庭用一个热水瓶和一个面盆的话，上海出产的热水瓶和面盆，就可以满足四、五千万个家庭的需要。
    一般都有四五十年历史的上海各个消费品工业，一直到解放以后才得到空前未有的发展。八年来，轻工业增长了二点八倍，原来基础最好的棉纺工业也增长了一点三倍；具有四十年历史的橡胶业，前三十一年发展的结果只能年产三千万双胶鞋，而今年已经上升到六千五百万双；历史更久的造纸业，今年纸的产量比1949年增长了五倍多；过去生产规模就比较大的卷烟、肥皂、油脂、金笔等行业，生产分别增长了一倍到四、五倍。
    八年来，上海出现了一万多种新花式新品种的消费品；其中有很多是为了满足生活上升中的农民的需要而设计的。农民反映过去的热水瓶在田间干活时不适用，装水不多又容易跌倒，上海的热水瓶厂就试制了一种八磅矮胖热水瓶，受到农民的欢迎。许多种新的药品、钢笔、儿童玩具和唱机，价廉物美，适应农村的购买力水平。从来没有为兄弟民族做过日用品的一些行业，这些年来试制了很多适合他们生活习惯的搪瓷用品、手摇缝纫机和舞蹈用的皮鞋。金笔、收音机、唱片、幻灯和体育用品等行业，也年年都有许多新的花色品种问世。
    上海近年来还出现了许多高级产品。制药工业增加了像异烟肼、烟酸等许多种重要药品和几十种技术要求较高的原料药。这里出现了我国第一个抗生素工厂以后，现在能生产的抗生素已有青霉素和金霉素两种。人们渴望多年的国产手表，在前年试制成功以后，目前在筹建工厂。从前以修理为主要业务的收音机、钢琴等行业，现在都变成了能够独立制造的工业行业，他们所制造的钢琴，还远销国外。
