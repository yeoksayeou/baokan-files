China's First Automatic Telephone Exchange Factory
Beijing Wired Radio Factory Starts Production

Xinhua News Agency, September 19th. China's first modern factory for manufacturing automatic telephone exchanges – the state-owned Beijing Wired Radio Factory – officially started production today, two and a half months ahead of schedule. Preparations for this factory began in 1953.

At the opening ceremony held this afternoon, a representative of the State Acceptance Committee announced the state acceptance conclusion, stating that all projects of the factory had met the design requirements and acceptance quality standards, and approved the factory's official commencement of production.

At the meeting, Chernousov, a representative from the Soviet Ministry of Radio Technology Industry who came to attend the opening ceremony, congratulated the factory, saying that after its opening, it would become a model for China's wired radio industry in mastering new technologies and a furnace for training cadres.

Xu Xin'san, director of the Beijing Wired Radio Factory, on behalf of all the factory workers, expressed his gratitude to the Soviet government and Soviet experts for their assistance in building the factory and called on all the factory workers to conscientiously and earnestly learn from the advanced Soviet experience in the future.

Malchiyanov, the chief engineer of the famous Soviet wired radio factory – Leningrad Red Dawn Factory, presented a banner from the Red Dawn Factory to the Beijing Wired Radio Factory; Xu Xin'san, the director of the Beijing Wired Radio Factory, on behalf of the factory, presented banners and components of the automatic telephone exchange produced by the factory to the Soviet Ministry of Radio Technology Industry and the Red Dawn Factory.

Automatic telephone exchanges are the most important equipment for automatic telephones. An automatic telephone exchange accommodating 2,000 users requires more than 5 million parts to be assembled. The production and assembly of parts are very precise, and the quality requirements are very high. The production process of this factory is highly mechanized and automated. According to its design capacity, the automatic telephone exchanges produced by this factory in three years are equivalent to the total number imported from foreign countries in the past decades. The commissioning of this factory has changed the backward situation in which China's demand for automatic telephone exchanges relied on imports.

The automatic telephone exchanges produced by the Beijing Wired Radio Factory are all the latest models. The "55" type automatic telephone exchange it produces can accommodate 200 to 900 users, suitable for use in factories, mines, enterprises, and small towns; the "47" type exchange can accommodate 1,000 to 10,000 users, suitable for use in large and medium-sized cities.

　　我国第一座自动电话交换机工厂
　　北京有线电厂开工生产
    据新华社19日讯　我国第一座现代化的制造自动电话交换机工厂——国营北京有线电厂，已于今天提前两个半月正式开工生产。这个工厂是1953年开始筹建的。
    在今天下午举行的开工典礼大会上，国家验收委员会代表宣布了国家验收的结论，认为这个厂全部工程达到设计要求和验收质量标准，并且批准这个工厂正式开工生产。
    会上，前来参加开工典礼的苏联无线电技术工业部代表切尔诺乌索夫，祝贺这个工厂开工后，将成为中国有线电工业部门在掌握新技术方面的榜样和培养干部的熔炉。
    北京有线电厂厂长徐欣三代表全厂职工向帮助建厂的苏联政府和苏联专家表示感谢，并号召全厂职工今后切实认真学习苏联先进经验。
    苏联著名有线电厂——列宁格勒红霞工厂的总工程师马尔其扬诺夫代表红霞工厂向北京有线电厂赠旗；北京有线电厂厂长徐欣三代表这个厂向苏联无线电技术工业部和红霞工厂赠送了锦旗和生产出来的自动电话交换机部件。
    自动电话交换机是自动电话最主要的设备，一部容纳两千个用户的自动电话交换机要由五百多万个零件装配起来，零件的生产和装配非常精密，质量要求很高。这个工厂的生产过程是高度机械化、自动化的。按照设计能力，这个厂三年所生产的自动电话交换机，就相当于我国过去几十年来从国外进口数量的总和。这个厂投入生产以后，改变了我国所需自动电话交换机依赖国外进口的落后状况。
    北京有线电厂生产的自动电话交换机都是最新式的。它所生产的“五五”式自动电话交换机可以容纳二百到九百个用户，适合于工矿、企业和小城镇使用；“四七”式交换机可以容纳一千到一万个用户，适合于大中城市使用。
