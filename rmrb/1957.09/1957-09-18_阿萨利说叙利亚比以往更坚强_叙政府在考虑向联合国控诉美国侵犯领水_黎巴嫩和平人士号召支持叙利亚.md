Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: Damascus News: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on the 16th, "Because of the solemn attitude shown by the Syrian people in defending their freedom and independence, Syria's position today is stronger than ever." He said: "However, we will continue to be vigilant and watch the situation with extreme caution."
　　Al-Assali also told reporters that the meeting between Egyptian and Syrian military leaders in Cairo on September 11 was very important because the results of the meeting will consolidate Syria's defenses against any aggression.
　　On the same day, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said that the Syrian government is studying the issue of bringing the recent violation of Syrian territorial waters by the U.S. Sixth Fleet to the United Nations.
　　Bitar said at a press conference that the campaign launched by the Western bloc aimed at overthrowing the current Syrian government is a blatant violation of the UN Charter, and this threat of aggression should be stopped in accordance with the Charter.
　　Bitar condemned the Eisenhower Doctrine and accused the United States of assuming the role of policeman in the Middle East. Referring to the gathering of Turkish troops near the Syrian border, he said that in the current explosive situation, it would be wise to keep these troops away from the international border.
　　Cairo News: Syrian Ambassador to Egypt, Rahman Azem, said in a statement on September 16 that since Syria exposed the imperialist conspiracy, he has continuously received letters and telegrams from all walks of life in Egypt and national people's organizations throughout the country. These letters and telegrams express their determination to support Syria and their willingness to provide assistance and volunteer to participate in the struggle to defend Syria's dignity and freedom. He said that this support proves the long-standing true unity between Egypt and Syria.
　　New Delhi News: Syrian Ambassador to India, Omer Abu Richa, said here on the evening of September 16 that the current psychological warfare against Syria reflects the desire of the imperialist powers to suppress the awakening and revival of Syrian nationalism and to enslave freedom-loving Syrians. They are now using "conspiracies and tricks to overthrow the current Syrian regime" and "strangling Syria through economic blockade."
　　Omer Abu Richa reiterated Syria's adherence to the Bandung Principles. He said that Syria will not be intimidated by this slander campaign. Syria is a sovereign country and has every right to "seek these things from wherever we can find everything we need."
　　TASS, Beirut, September 16: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Akhbar" published an appeal from Lebanese peace activists to all Lebanese people. The appeal exposed the U.S. imperialist conspiracy against Syria.
　　The appeal said that the purpose of this conspiracy is to eliminate Syria's national independence policy of refusing to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." This conspiracy is to be carried out by the United States, Israel, and the Baghdad Pact participating countries through simultaneous provocations and military threats.
　　The appeal concluded: Lebanese peace activists call on all citizens of Lebanon, regardless of political views or parties, to stop the occurrence of war in the Near East and to support Syria.

　　叙政府在考虑向联合国控诉美国侵犯领水
　　黎巴嫩和平人士号召支持叙利亚
    本报综合报道　据新华社17日讯：大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利16日说：“由于叙利亚人民在保卫他们的自由和独立方面所表现的庄严态度，叙利亚今天的地位比以往更加强有力了。”他说：“然而，我们将继续以极端警惕的心情警戒着并且注视着局势。”
    阿萨利还对新闻记者说，埃及和叙利亚军事首脑9月11日在开罗举行的会谈非常重要，因为会谈的结果将会巩固叙利亚的防务以抵抗任何侵略。
    同一天，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔说，叙利亚政府正在研究向联合国提出美国第六舰队最近侵犯叙利亚领水问题。
    比塔尔在记者招待会上说，西方集团发动的、目的在于推翻叙利亚现政府的运动是露骨地违反联合国宪章的，应当根据宪章来制止这种侵略威胁。
    比塔尔谴责艾森豪威尔主义，并且指责美国自任为中东的警察。他在提到土耳其军队在叙利亚边境附近集结的事情时说，在目前这种爆炸性的局势下，让这种军队远离国际边境驻留才是明智的。
    开罗消息：叙利亚驻埃及大使拉赫曼·阿泽姆9月16日在一项声明中说，自从叙利亚揭露了帝国主义的阴谋以来，他不断收到埃及各阶层人民和全国各地人民团体的信件和电报，这些信件和电报都表示决心支持叙利亚，愿意提供援助和志愿参加保卫叙利亚的尊严和自由的斗争。他说，这种支持证明了埃叙两国长久以来的真正团结。
    新德里消息：叙利亚驻印度大使欧默尔·阿布·里夏9月16日晚在这里说，目前对叙利亚进行的神经战反映了帝国主义强权压制叙利亚民族主义的觉醒和复兴以及奴役爱好自由的叙利亚人的愿望。他们现在使用“阴谋和诡计要来推翻叙利亚的现政权”，并且“通过经济封锁来绞杀叙利亚”。
    欧默尔·阿布·里夏重申叙利亚遵循万隆原则。他说，叙利亚是不会被这种诽谤运动吓倒的。叙利亚是一个主权国家，它完全有权利“从我们能找到我们所需的一切东西的地方寻求这些东西”。
    据塔斯社贝鲁特16日消息：黎巴嫩“消息报”发表了黎巴嫩和平人士致全体黎巴嫩人民的呼吁书。呼吁书揭露了美帝国主义反对叙利亚的阴谋。
    呼吁书说，这个阴谋的目的是想消灭拒绝接受“艾森豪威尔主义”的叙利亚的民族独立政策。这次阴谋是要由美国、以色列和巴格达条约参加国同时进行挑衅和军事威胁。
    呼吁书最后说：黎巴嫩和平人士呼吁黎巴嫩的全体公民，不分政治观点和党派，都来制止近东战争的发生，都来支持叙利亚。
