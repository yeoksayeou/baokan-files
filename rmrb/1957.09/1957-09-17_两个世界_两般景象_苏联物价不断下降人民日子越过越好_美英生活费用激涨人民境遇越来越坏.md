Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. The twenty-third issue of the "Propaganda Handbook," recently published in Moscow, lists many materials illustrating that the cost of living in capitalist countries is constantly rising, and the lives of the working people are getting worse and worse. However, the purchasing power of the Soviet people is rapidly increasing, and their lives are becoming increasingly prosperous.
    The material shows that in May of this year, the cost of living in the United States increased by 20% compared to the average cost from 1947-1949; food prices rose 13% compared to the average price from 1947-1948, clothing rose 9%, footwear rose 26%, rent rose 34%, water, electricity, and gas rose 12%, medical expenses rose 35%, and transportation costs rose 31%. Under these circumstances, the U.S. Department of Labor has to admit that the cost of living is rising month by month. At the end of last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture submitted a report to Congress stating that 25 million Americans did not meet the minimum food standards and were living in a state of semi-starvation. Whenever prices rise, these people suffer the most.
    According to calculations by American bourgeois scholars, a family of four must have an annual income of $5,600 to maintain the minimum necessary living expenses, but 56% of Americans have an annual income of less than $5,000. In June of this year, an American union leader said that one-third of American families have an annual income of no more than $3,000, and the living conditions of these families are very poor.
    There are now 3.5 million unemployed workers in the United States. According to predictions by famous economists, the number of unemployed will increase in the coming months. Tragedies of suicides due to poverty are frequently heard in the United States.
    The material also shows that the cost of living in France increased by 12% from January of last year to May of this year. Recently, news of rising prices in France has been heard daily. In July of this year, the price of household coal rose by 8%, and the price of taxis rose by 15%. The prices of bread, meat, and milk have also risen. On August 1st, the prices of 24 industrial products were increased by 5% or 6%.
    Summer is supposed to be the season when vegetable prices fall, but in the Paris market from June to July, cabbage rose by 72%, tomatoes rose by 39%, and cauliflower rose by 33%. Therefore, "L'Humanité" said that cabbage soup has now become a precious dish.
    The "Propaganda Handbook" pointed out that the average retail price of various commodities in the United Kingdom has increased by 67% compared to 1946. The price of coal in the United Kingdom has risen by six shillings and six pence per ton in recent months, which is the second major price increase in the past ten years. Railway freight rates have increased by 20%. From July 10th, rents have also been greatly increased.
    The cost of living in other capitalist countries is also rising without exception.
    In Italy, the cost of living has increased by 15% in the past five years. Compared to 1953, the cost of living in Latin American countries in 1956 increased by 28% in Mexico, 31% in Argentina, 67% in Brazil, and 74% in Paraguay.
    However, the Soviet Union is a completely different scene: prices are continuously decreasing, the people's purchasing power is continuously increasing, consumption capacity is continuously growing, and the people's lives are becoming increasingly prosperous. In the first half of this year, the average wage of Soviet workers and staff increased by 5% compared to the first half of 1956, and various preferential benefits and subsidies for workers and staff increased by 50%. In the whole year of 1956, due to the government's adoption of various measures to improve people's welfare, the people's extra income exceeded 35 billion rubles. It is estimated that this income amount will increase this year due to wage adjustments, shortening of working hours, and so on.
    The material shows that since 1947, the Soviet Union has reduced prices seven times. By 1955, the prices of Soviet industrial and agricultural products had been reduced by about 50% compared to 1947. Although the large-scale annual price reductions have stopped, small-scale price reductions are still frequently heard. For example, in 1956, the prices of televisions, photographs, clocks and watches, children's clothing, aluminum utensils, and fabrics were all reduced. Due to the reduction in market prices, the people saved 5 billion rubles in 1956. At the beginning of this year and in April, the Soviet Union reduced the prices of certain items twice in succession.
    The consumption of food by the Soviet people has also greatly increased. According to a typical survey of some Moscow worker families, the current food consumption compared to 1940 shows that milk and dairy products have doubled, eggs and meat have increased by two-thirds, vegetables have increased by half, and fruits have increased by three and a half times.

　　两个世界　两般景象
　　苏联物价不断下降人民日子越过越好
　　美英生活费用激涨人民境遇越来越坏
    新华社莫斯科16日电　莫斯科最近出版的“宣传鼓动员手册”第二十三期列举了许多材料，说明资本主义国家生活费用不断高涨，劳动人民的生活越来越坏；而苏联人民的购买力却迅速提高，生活日趋富裕。
    材料表明，今年5月美国的生活费用比1947—1949年的平均费用增加了20％；食物价格比1947—1948年的平均价格上升13％，衣著上涨9％，鞋类上涨26％，房租上涨34％，水电、瓦斯上涨12％，医药费上涨35％，交通费上涨31％。在这种情况下美国劳动部也不得不承认，生活费用是在逐月不断地上升的。去年年底，美国农业部提交国会的报告中说，有两千五百万美国人没有达到最低的食物标准，过着半饥半饱的生活。每逢物价上涨，这些人首先遭殃。
    据美国资产阶级学者们的计算，四口之家每年必须有五千六百美元的收入才能维持生活必需的最低费用，但是美国有56％的人全年收入不到五千美元。今年6月，美国一个工会领袖说，三分之一的美国家庭全年的收入不超过三千元，这些家庭的生活条件很坏。
    美国现在有三百五十万失业工人。据著名的经济学家们预测，失业人数在最近几个月内还会增加。美国因贫穷而自杀的惨剧时有所闻。
    材料还表明，法国的生活费用从去年1月到今年5月增长了12％。最近法国物价腾贵的消息日有所闻，今年7月间，家庭用煤的价格上涨了8％，出租汽车的价格上涨了15％。面包、肉类和牛奶价格也都上涨了。8月1日，二十四种工业品的价格又提高了百分之五或六。
    夏天本来是蔬菜价格下降的时节，但是在6月到7月的巴黎市场上，白菜上涨了72％，西红柿上涨了39％，花椰菜上涨了33％。因此，“人道报”说，白菜汤现在成为珍贵的菜肴了。
    “宣传鼓动员手册”指出，现在英国各种商品的平均零售价格比1946年增加了67％。英国的煤价在最近几个月内每吨上涨了六先令六便士，这是最近十年来的第二次大提价。铁路运价上涨了20％。7月10日起，房租又大大地提高了。
    其他资本主义国家的生活费用也无不上升。
    意大利在最近五年来生活费用上涨了15％。拉丁美洲各国1956年的生活费用和1953年相比，墨西哥上升了28％，阿根廷上升了31％，巴西上升了67％，巴拉圭上升了74％。
    然而，苏联却完全是另外一幅景象：物价不断下降，人民购买力不断提高，消费能力不断增长，人民的生活日益富裕。今年上半年，苏联工人和职员的平均工资比1956年上半年增加了5％，工人与职员的各种优抚金和补贴增加了50％。1956年全年，由于政府采取了各项提高人民福利的措施，人民的额外收入超过了三百五十亿卢布。估计，今年由于调整工资、缩短工时等，这个收入数目还会增加。
    材料表明从1947年起，苏联共减低了七次物价。到1955年，苏联工农业产品的价格比1947年约降低了50％。现在一年一度的大规模减低物价虽然已经停止，但是小规模减价仍时有所闻。如1956年电视机、照相片、钟表、童装、铝制器具、布匹等都减了价。由于市场物价的降低，1956年人民就节省了五十亿卢布。今年年初和4月份，苏联又先后对某些物品减了两次价。
    苏联人民食物的消费量也大大的增加了。根据对莫斯科一些工人家庭的典型调查，现在的食物消费量和1940年相比，牛奶和奶制品增加了一倍，蛋和肉增加了三分之二，蔬菜增加了半倍，水果增加了三倍半。
