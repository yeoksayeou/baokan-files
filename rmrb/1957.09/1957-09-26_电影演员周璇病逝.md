    电影演员周璇病逝
    新华社上海24日电　著名电影演员、歌唱家周璇22日在上海病逝。今天，上海电影界人士一百五十多人在万国殡仪馆举行了公祭仪式。公祭后，由周璇生前好友黎锦辉、黄绍芬等人扶灵，送往静安公墓火葬。
    曾为周璇进行治疗的上海精神病疗养院院长苏复对记者说：周璇早在1940年就开始精神失常。由于在香港受了重大的刺激，1950年她回到上海时，精神病更严重了。共产党和人民政府想尽各种办法替她治疗，在生活上对她关怀备至。到今年1月，她的精神分裂症有显著好转。她开始参加了一些社交活动。7月19日，她突然发高热，甚至昏迷，当即由上海精神病疗养院转送上海第一医学院附属第一医院，经中、西医会诊，临床诊断为脑炎。经过治疗，病情一度好转。但是到9月20日，她高烧复发，经医师大力急救无效，22日下午八时五十五分逝世。
