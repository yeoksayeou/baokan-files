“The So-Called Myth of American Worker Happiness”
By Harvey Swados

Editor's Note: The American bourgeois propaganda machine frequently touts how "affluent" American life is, portraying America as a paradise on earth. Indeed, in America, there is a parasitic class with outrageously high incomes, living a life of extravagance and debauchery. However, for the vast majority of the American working people, the "American way of life" is not something to be envied. They must work overtime, straining every nerve, for their own and their family's livelihoods, until they are exhausted and dismissed, ending up on the streets. Below is an excerpt from an article published in the American "Nation" magazine on August 17. Based on his own investigations and experiences, the author refutes the myth of American worker happiness.

I am neither an economist nor a sociologist, nor a politician. I also do not possess any authoritative statistical data worth arguing about. My profession is merely that of a writer, who, in the thirties, forties, and fifties, had the opportunity to work in different factories. The following views are based solely on my impressions from my last period of factory work in 1956.

A car worker's average income is just over two dollars an hour. This makes him one of the highest-paid factory workers in the country. This is the result of over twenty years of struggle led by labor unions. After compulsory deductions for taxes, social security, pension funds, union dues, and unexpected deductions for medical expenses and various charitable donations, his income for a forty-hour work week is nearly seventy or eighty dollars a week. Does this make him middle class in terms of income? Of course, a further question about what kind of life a family can live on this amount of money in the fifties would be even more revealing. I know how they live.

First of all, he always works far more than forty hours a week, as long as he can. Since no auto company can guarantee workers a solid fifty weeks of forty-hour work each year, auto workers know they must work as much as possible when it is available. During peak production periods, he often has to work nine, ten, eleven, or even often twelve hours a day on the assembly line for several weeks continuously. And that's not all. If he has a family, he has to take on some "side" jobs, even if he doesn't like it. I have worked on the assembly line with people who were also machinists, repairmen, salesmen, contractors, construction workers, farmers, car drivers, lumberyard workers, or shop assistants. I suspect there are many more outside official statistics, because some people often prefer less money, as long as they can get privately earned wages that are not taxed.

Not only that. Factory workers with families still cannot pay off the debts burdening them for cars, washing machines, dryers, televisions, clothes, houses, etc., without family help. Even if he has one or two jobs, working fifty, sixty, or even seventy hours a week, he has to include his wife's or his children's, his brother-in-law's income, or even his mother's social security or his father's veteran's benefits. The working-class family is currently not built around a single male earner, but rather by several earners, often belonging to several generations, combined to obtain what they need – or are forced to believe they must have.

What are the worker's middle-class hopes? The worker hopes to get more wages, more humane working conditions, and more secure job security.

The middle class's view that workers are now completely the same as everyone else contains an element of self-deception. I saw this particularly clearly last year when my middle-class friends expressed surprise and sympathy when they heard that I was going back to work in a factory. If workers are now completely middle class, what is there to be surprised about?

Almost without exception, the people I worked with on the assembly line last year felt like trapped beasts. Due to differences in age and circumstances, they either resigned themselves to fate, complaining about the work they were doing, or desperately looked for other jobs, possibly with the same wages, but with some variety or hope for improvement. They hated being arbitrarily driven by vicious foremen, hated working like blindfolded donkeys, hated their livelihoods depending on a frantic machine, hated working in a place where there wasn't even a seat for a twelve-minute break. (Currently, during break time, workers can only sit on fire hydrants, the edges of cargo boxes, or in the greasy aisles of spit-filled toilets.)

Since the assembly line needs young blood (if you are over thirty-five, it is difficult to hope to be hired), I saw groups of new faces every day in the factory where I worked; at the same time, the turnover of workers is so rapid, and absenteeism is so common (those young people are absent one or two days a week to look for other jobs), that the factory has to hire more workers to have enough people working at the start of the shift.

Some may object, arguing that white-collar workers (clerks, freelancers, etc.) also do not like their jobs, and do them only to buy supplies for their families, while also secretly looking for other jobs. To this, I can only answer: I think this only proves not the disappearance of the working class, but the proletarianization of the middle class. The separation of white-collar workers from tools and their products, the enslavement of them on installment payment schedules (just as workers are still bound by work schedules), the anxiety they bring home with briefcases to do evening overtime work (just as workers beg for extended work hours), their migration from their original residential areas to the suburbs (just as workers move from their original residences to the top of skyscrapers) – all of this, in my view, means that white-collar workers are entering (although they may be carrying a briefcase full of supplies) the gloomy world of the working class.

    “所谓美国工人幸福的神话”
    美国　哈维·斯瓦多斯
    编者按　美国的资产阶级宣传机器经常吹嘘美国生活如何“富裕”，把美国描写成为人间的天堂。的确，在美国，有着收入出奇的高的寄生阶级，他们过着骄奢淫佚的生活，但是对于美国的广大劳动人民来说，“美国生活方式”并不是值得羡慕的东西，他们为了自己和家庭的生计，不得不超时工作，拉紧每一根神经，直到他们精疲力衰而被解雇，流落街头。下面登载的是8月17日美国“民族周刊”上发表的一篇文章的摘要。作者根据他亲自的调查和体验，驳斥了关于美国工人生活幸福的神话。
    我不是经济学家或社会学家，也不是政治家，在我的手里也没有掌握着什么值得争论的权威的统计资料。我的职业不过是一个作家，在三十年代、四十年代和五十年代都曾有机会在不同的工厂里作过工。下面的看法仅仅是根据我1956年在工厂工作的最后一段时期的印象写出来的。
    汽车工人平均收入每小时不过两块钱多一点。这样他就成了全国工厂工人收入最多的之一。这是经过了二十几年的由工会领导的奋斗得来的。在强制的扣除了捐税、社会保险、养老保险金和工会会费以及意外的扣除了医药费和各种慈善捐款以后，他一星期工作了四十小时的收入几乎接近一星期才有七、八十美元。这是否使得他在收入上成了中产阶级呢？当然，假如再进一步问一句，在五十年代里挣这点钱一家人能过怎样的生活那就更能说明问题了。我知道他们是怎么过的。
    首先，只要他能做到，他每周的工作总是大大的超过四十小时的。由于没有一个汽车公司能保证工人们能每年有牢靠的五十周每周四十小时的工作，因此汽车工人们知道他们必须在可能的范围内尽量地工作。在生产量达到高峰的时期，他往往好几个星期不断地每天在装配线上要做九个、十个、十一个甚至时常是十二个小时的工作。还不仅如此。如果他还有家属的话，尽管他不喜欢，他还得兼搞一些“业余”工作。我曾在装配线上和这样的人一起工作过，他们兼做机工、修理工、推销员、承包人、建筑工人、农人、汽车司机、木场工人或店员。我猜想一定还有很多是在官方的统计数字之外的，因为有的人往往情愿钱少一些，只要他可以私下得到不经上税的工资。
    不仅此也。有家属的工厂工人如果没有家庭的帮助，他仍不能偿付目前迫着要付的汽车、洗衣机、干燥机、电视机、衣服、房子等等的债务负担。即使他有一个或两个工作，每周工作五十、六十甚至七十小时，他也不得不把他妻子的或者他儿女的、小舅子的收入也算在内，甚至他母亲的社会保险金或者他父亲的退伍金。工人阶级的家庭目前还不是围绕在一个男性的挣钱的人建立起来的，而是由好几个挣钱的人，常常是属于好几代的人，合在一起来获取他们所需要的东西——或者是被迫使他们相信是他们所必须要的东西。
    什么是工人的中产阶级的希望呢？工人的希望是能得到多一点的工资，比较人道一些的工作条件，和比较安全的职业保障。
    中产阶级认为工人目前已经和所有的人完全一样的这种看法是夹杂着自欺欺人的成份的。这点我从去年当我的中产阶级朋友听说我要从新进入工厂工作而对我表示的惊愕和同情里看得特别清楚。如果目前工人已经完全是属于中产阶级了，那还有什么值得惊愕的呢？
    几乎毫无例外地，去年同我在装配线上一道工作的人都感到像掉在陷阱里的野兽一样。由于年龄和环境的不同，他们或者听天由命，对于自己所做的工作自怨自艾，或者拼命的寻找其他的工作，也可能工资是一样的，但是可以有些变化，或者有改善的希望。他们厌恶被凶恶的工头任意驱遣，厌恶像蒙了眼睛的驴子一样工作，厌恶自己的生计要依靠在一架疯狂的机器上，厌恶在一个连十二分钟休息都没有一个坐处的地方工作。（目前在休息的时间里工人只能坐在救火龙头上，货物箱的边上，或者满地唾沫的油腻腻厕所的过道里。）
    由于装配线上需要年青的血液（如果你过了三十五岁，你就很难希望被雇用），因此在我工作的那个工厂里，每天都能看见成群的新面孔；同时工人的流动是如此的神速，缺勤又是这样的普遍（那些年青的人每星期都有一两天旷工去寻找别的工作），这样就使得工厂不得不多雇一些工人，为的是在开工时能有足够的人工作。
    有的人也许会提出异议，认为白领工人（职员，自由职业者等）也不喜欢他的工作，其所以做下来了，只不过是为了为他的家庭购买用品，同时他也经常在暗暗寻找其他的工作。对于这种说法我只能回答说：我认为无论如何这都只能证明不是工人阶级的消失，而是中产阶级的无产阶级化。白领工人与工具和他的产品的分家，把他们束缚在分期付款时间表上的奴役（正像工人仍然束缚在工作时间表上一样），使他们带了公事包回家做晚间加班工作的焦虑情绪（正像工人恳求延长工作时间一样），他们从本来居住的地区迁移到郊区去（正像工人由他们原来的住处搬到摩天楼顶上一样）——所有这些在我看来意味着白领工人是正在进入（虽然他手里可能抱满了用品）工人阶级的灰暗的世界。
