It's Not About Less Grain Retention, But Lower Consciousness
Feidong County's Anle Agricultural Cooperative in Feidong County Gains from Debating Grain Issues

(Our report) The work team of the Rural Work Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China led a large-scale debate in the Anle Cooperative of Feidong County, Bengbu Prefecture, reasonably resolving the ideological problems existing among the members of this third-category cooperative.

During the period of “big blooming and big contending” (大鸣大放), some cooperative members said that the grain ration standard was too low and not enough to eat. Some poor and lower-middle peasants knew it was enough but were afraid of being ridiculed by others. Some were afraid that they would not receive relief if they spoke up. Others believed that a little more would provide a greater margin of comfort... These ideological problems have been resolved through the methods of "comparing the present with the past, presenting facts, and reasoning things out" in the socialist great debate.

Poor peasant Chen Bangzhu said that before liberation, he rented sixteen mu of land from the landlord. He could harvest three thousand eight hundred jin of grain a year, but he had to pay more than two thousand jin in rent and taxes, and he also had to keep two hundred and fifty jin of seeds. After all the deductions, one person could only eat two hundred and thirty-six jin of grain a year. In the spring, they had to eat elm leaves and locust flowers. After the land reform, each person could eat three hundred and eighty-seven jin of grain per year, and now it has increased to five hundred and twenty jin. After presenting the facts, he asked everyone: "Do you say this is more or less?" Sun Benchuan, Sun Benhe, and Sun Benhai, three brothers, argued at the debate meeting. Sun Benchuan said after a careful calculation that the current grain ration was more than before liberation, but Sun Benhe disagreed. Sun Benhai immediately questioned him: "Before liberation, didn't the three of us brothers all work as strong laborers, exerting the strength of oxen, but which year did we not go hungry? When it came to the New Year, the landlords and rich peasants had seven courses of wine and eight courses of dishes, but our family didn't even have rice for the New Year's Eve dinner! Have we been hungry any year since liberation? Have we lacked New Year's Eve dinner any year?" Sun Benhe was left speechless.

In the debate, all the cooperative members also calculated several major accounts: of the 567 households in the cooperative, 517 households now have more grain rations than before liberation. Only some prosperous middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants have less, but it is still enough to eat.

After the discussion, everyone's thinking changed. They said: "If everyone was like us, cadres, the army, and workers would all starve." In the end, everyone also talked about: now the state firmly controls the grain, ensuring that everyone has enough grain to eat, and the grain price is like a nail hammered into a board, it doesn't move at all. The unified purchase and sale of grain is good and we must insist on implementing this method! And they returned several thousand jin of grain coupons that had been issued to them.

### 不是留粮少而是觉悟低  肥东县安乐农业社辩论粮食问题有收获

    不是留粮少而是觉悟低
    肥东县安乐农业社辩论粮食问题有收获
    本报讯　中共安徽省委农村工作部工作组在蚌埠专区肥东县的安乐社领导的大辩论，合情合理地解决了这个三类社社员中存在的思想问题。
    安乐社在大鸣大放中，有的社员说口粮标准低了，不够吃；有的贫农和下中农虽然知道够吃，但怕别人讽刺不敢讲；有的怕讲了以后得不到救济；有的则认为再增加一点，可以宽裕些……。这些思想问题，在社会主义大辩论中，通过“比现在，比过去，摆事实，讲道理”的方法，已经得到解决。
    贫农陈邦柱说，解放以前，他租了地主十六亩地，一年能收三千八百斤粮食，但交租交捐就得二千多斤，还得留二百五十斤种子。七折八扣以后，一个人一年只能吃到二百三十六斤粮食，到了春天就得吃榆树叶和槐树花。土地改革以后，每人每年能吃到三百八十七斤粮，现在则增加到五百二十斤。他摆出事实之后，问大家：“你们说这是多了，还是少了？”孙本传、孙本和和孙本海兄弟三个，在辩论会上争论起来。孙本传算过细账后，说是现在口粮比解放前多了，但孙本和不同意。孙本海当即质问他：“解放前我们兄弟三个都帮大工，出的牛力气，可那一年不挨饿？到了过年的时候，地主、富农家七酒八席，可我们家连年饭米都没有！解放后咱那年挨过饿？那年缺过年饭？”问得孙本和无言答对。
    全社社员在辩论中又算了几笔大账：现在全社五百六十七户中，比解放前增加口粮的有五百一十七户，只有部分富裕中农和地主富农减少了些，但是也够吃。
    讨论后，大家脑子都转过来了。他们说：“要是都像我们这样，干部、军队、工人都要饿肚子了。”最后大家还谈到：现在国家稳稳实实地掌握粮食，让大家都有足够的粮食吃，而且粮价就像钉子钉在板上一样，一动也不动。粮食统购统销就是好，一定要坚持实行这个办法！并且还把几千斤已发给他们的粮票退了回来。
