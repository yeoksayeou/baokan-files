In a class society, people's ideological awareness and political attitudes differ due to their different class positions; people's words, actions, and conduct reflect the interests of a particular class. Precisely for this reason, Marxists must adopt a class viewpoint and a method of class analysis when observing all issues in the realm of people's social life, to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, to differentiate between right and wrong, to unite ourselves, and to strike at the enemy. The class viewpoint and method of class analysis are among the most powerful weapons in the arsenal of Marxist-Leninist theory.

The Chinese Communist Party and our great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, are masters at using this weapon. As everyone knows, in every historical period of the Chinese revolution, in every intricate, complex, and unpredictable social upheaval, our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always skillfully used this weapon to scientifically analyze the class conditions and political trends of various social strata, to determine who are the main forces of the Chinese revolution, who are the friends of the Chinese revolution, and who are the enemies of the Chinese revolution; and to formulate clear programs and strategies, to accumulate and strengthen revolutionary forces, to isolate and strike at the enemy, and to guide the Chinese revolution step by step towards victory.

The class viewpoint and method of class analysis are also of utmost importance to our Communist Youth League’s mission of educating young people in the spirit of communism. This is because youth is not an independent social class (similar to intellectuals), and youth does not live in isolation on some "desert island." Young people come from different social classes and bring with them the ideological awareness and political views of those different social classes. In the process of their growth, young people are inevitably influenced by the old ideas of various social strata. If we abandon the class viewpoint and method of class analysis, it is conceivable that we will find it difficult to distinguish which young people support the revolution, which disapprove of or oppose the revolution, which are ideologically advanced, and which are ideologically backward or reactionary, as well as the social and historical roots of these thoughts and behaviors. In this way, our understanding of the political and ideological situation of young people will be a complete blur, and it will be impossible to help young people distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, differentiate between right and wrong, and accept communist education.

How should we view the youth of our country? We believe that we should view them in this way: On the one hand, the current generation of young people in our country has basically grown up under the loving care and education of the Party and the state since the national liberation. Compared to the older generation, they have received less old influence, their thinking is relatively pure, and they are more receptive to new things. After several years of patriotic and socialist education, over 90% of the young people in our country support the Party and socialism. Only a very small number of young people adhere to a reactionary stance, opposing the Party and socialism. Therefore, generally speaking, the youth of our country are very good, and their socialist consciousness is high. We must firmly believe in the majority of young people and firmly believe in our own strength. It is wrong for some comrades to underestimate the Party's influence on young people and to underestimate the achievements of ideological work.

However, on the other hand, it must also be seen that many young people in our country still come from petty-bourgeois families. Most of the young workers directly engaged in industrial labor are still yesterday's peasants, students, and urban poor. As for university students, those from landlord, rich peasant, and bourgeois families still account for about 30% to 50%. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the brand of a class." Given the complex class origins of our young people, and the fact that their childhood and adolescence were spent in old China, their minds inevitably retain various old ideological influences. Although the socialist ownership of the means of production has been basically established in our country, socialist and communist ideas, which are compatible with this ownership, have not yet been established in the majority of young people. The erroneous thoughts exposed by young people during the period of great blooming and debate, such as individualism, liberalism, egalitarianism, and reactionary nationalism, are clear evidence of this. Therefore, it is obviously incorrect to fail to see that our young people have not yet undergone a thorough ideological transformation, to overestimate their socialist consciousness, or to think that young people are already "as pure as a blank sheet of paper" and no longer need to "destroy capitalist ideas and establish socialist ideas," and that the main issue is to "increase knowledge" and "learn skills." In fact, it is much more difficult to defeat old ideological influences than to defeat old systems. Our task of "destroying capitalist ideas and establishing socialist ideas" among young people will be a long-term and very arduous undertaking.

Therefore, in the process of conducting socialist and communist ideological education among young people, we must pay attention to using the Marxist class viewpoint and method of class analysis. After the upsurge of socialism, there was a brief period when some comrades only paid attention to working according to the general characteristics of young people and relatively neglected the class viewpoint and method of class analysis, and neglected to strictly demand young people with socialist and communist ideas. This is incorrect. Of course, taking care of the characteristics of young people is an important principle of our Communist Youth League work and an important basis for carrying out work among young people. Without taking care of the characteristics of young people, we cannot fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of young people, we cannot effectively carry out communist education, and our work will become divorced from the masses and will lead to deviations and errors. The purpose of taking care of the characteristics of young people is to better promote the development of young people's moral, intellectual, and physical education, to cultivate young people into a new generation with socialist political consciousness, practical labor skills, and a healthy physique, and to strive for the realization of the great cause of socialism and communism.

As mentioned above, precisely because the class viewpoint and method of class analysis are so important to our cause of educating young people, some rightists have launched a fierce attack on it during this period of great blooming and debate. On this issue, they have gone to extremes in distorting and slandering, maliciously provoking the close relationship between young people and the Party and the Communist Youth League. They have also fantasized about "advising" us to "abandon" the class viewpoint and method of class analysis. Because rightists have released some specious fallacies that have confused some kind-hearted but ideologically confused young people, it is still necessary to refute them here.

One of the fallacies of the rightists is that the method of class analysis is "outdated." The main argument of the rightists' "outdated theory" is said to be because "large-scale class struggle has basically ended." In fact, this is a trick played by the rightists to secretly confuse concepts, attempting to create the illusion that the "basic" end of "large-scale" class struggle is the "complete" end of "all" class struggle. However, these are two concepts that cannot be confused: the basic end of large-scale class struggle does not equal the extinction of all class struggle. As everyone knows, class struggle in our country has not been extinguished, and in the foreseeable future, it will continue to be full of class struggle in different forms and degrees. This includes the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, the struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Chinese people's struggle against the remnant counter-revolutionaries who have not yet been eliminated, the struggle of the broad masses of workers and peasants against the bourgeoisie and against the spontaneous forces of capitalism, the current anti-rightist struggle being carried out by the people, and the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field. Internationally, there is also the struggle between the Chinese people and imperialism. All of these are class struggles. Ideological struggle is a reflection of class struggle in people's minds. Moreover, "the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field in our country will require a considerable amount of time to resolve" (Mao Zedong). Therefore, we cannot help but ask the rightist gentlemen, can you deny these class struggles? Since classes and class struggle still exist, you want us to "abandon" the class viewpoint and method of class analysis. Isn't that ulterior motive!

The rightists have also picked up the fragments of the bankrupt bourgeois theory and repeated the old tune of "supra-class." They talk a lot about "human nature" while denying the class nature of people. They talk a lot about "truth" while denying people's class stance, saying that "stance and truth are contradictory, and if you want a stance, you have no truth." Some young people who do not know right from wrong have even listened to the rightists' nonsense and are looking for the so-called "fair referee position."

In class society and class struggle, is there abstract human nature and the so-called "referee position"? There will not be. As we have mentioned before, people cannot live in isolation and cannot leave a certain class position and social life. It seems that even the rightists themselves dare not deny this. Since this is the case, according to the philosophical logic that "generality is contained in all individuality," isn't the rightists' insistence on denying people's class nature denying even the class and social position by which they live? What is truth? In terms of people's social life, truth is the objective law of social development. If this law contradicts the bourgeois position, that is absolutely true. Because the bourgeoisie lives by exploiting others, and the laws of social development indicate that this exploitation must be eliminated. The proletariat is different; it is the most advanced class and the most selfless class. The objective laws of social development are completely consistent with the proletariat's own interests and with the great historical mission of the proletariat to liberate all mankind. Only by standing on the proletariat's position can we grasp the objective truth. As for the "supra-class" theory, it is even more of a deceitful trick by the rightists. Because under the conditions of the existence of class struggle, people are either standing on this class's side or standing on that class's side. It's either one or the other, and there is no middle ground. The rightists want young people to be "supra-class." "Supra" what class? Isn't it "supra" the proletariat, standing on the side of the bourgeoisie. Think about it, even when the rightists were talking about "supra-class," weren't they themselves firmly standing on the side of the bourgeoisie, launching an attack on the Party! Some young people say: "I only want a petty-bourgeois position." In fact, both the bourgeoisie and the petty-bourgeois belong to the capitalist system, with only the difference of a "petty" word. Still other young people say: "I won't be a leftist, and I won't be a rightist, but a righteous person." It seems that this is the most "fair" thing to do. But in fact, since you are not a leftist and do not stand on the side of the people and socialism, what "righteousness" and "fairness" can you talk about? Isn't your kind of "righteousness" and "fairness" already beneficial to the rightists and welcomed by the rightists!

The rightists also took advantage of the issue of contradictions among the people to make wild remarks, saying that the "only" thing filling the lives of young people now is "all kinds of right and wrong issues, without the contradictions of various class ideas." And they further oppose our examining the class origins and political history of young people, and oppose our dividing young people into left, middle, and right. They say that because we have adhered to the class viewpoint and method of class analysis, young people have "formed an absurd sense of right and wrong," created "walls" and "ditches" in people's relationships, and played a "negative role" and "harmful role" in educating young people, and so on.

In fact, it is not others who have "formed an absurd sense of right and wrong," but the rightists themselves. Now, the facts of the anti-rightist struggle have shown that there are contradictions between ourselves and the enemy among young people, and there are hostile ideas and rightists among young people. Even in the right and wrong issues within young people, as mentioned above, it is still "full of" "all kinds" of "contradictions of various class ideas." Since there are still contradictions between ourselves and the enemy among young people, and since the right and wrong issues of young people are still "full of" "contradictions of various class ideas," our class viewpoint and method of class analysis cannot be abandoned for even a moment.

The Communist Youth League is an organization that educates young people in the spirit of communism under the leadership of the Party, not a small sect; it has no private interests other than the interests of the state and the people. The reason why we conduct class analysis of young people's political and ideological problems is first of all to respect the facts. Because young people's class origins and political history, young people's ideological awareness and political attitudes are not the same, and this is an objective existence. The more important reason why we do this is to better unite young people, educate young people, and help young people "destroy capitalist ideas and establish socialist ideas," with a high degree of political awareness and good moral character. Therefore, it is in line with the interests of our country and also in line with the wishes and requirements of the vast majority of young people to progress. At the same time, we are not mechanical materialists and "component only" theorists. We pay more attention to young people's current performance. How their current performance is in the socialist construction of the country is the main criterion for us to measure whether a young person is progressive and whether he is loyal to socialism. A young person, regardless of his class origin, political history, or what kind of mistakes he has made, is welcomed by us as long as he is willing to make progress and correct himself. In terms of young people's political attitudes and ideological cultivation, being left, middle, or right, or progressive, intermediate, or reactionary, are all developing according to young people's own development, and are not immutable. And we believe that in our country, due to the just nature of our cause, the correctness of our Party's leadership, and our Party's meticulous care and education for young people, the vast majority of young people in our country resolutely follow the Party and are trustworthy. Even the very few young people who have made serious mistakes can still be reformed as long as they do not refuse to reform. The rightists' conspiracy to compete with our Party for young people is doomed to failure.

It is not surprising that the rightists hate and attack our class viewpoint and method of class analysis. Because like a demon-revealing mirror, it has, is, or will eventually expose these rightists in their true colors and make them look ugly. It is also because the rightists understand that as long as we abandon the class viewpoint and method of class analysis, our cause of communist education for young people will be harmed, and the rightists' conspiracy to compete with us for young people can succeed. Therefore, we must never be fooled by the rightists.

    坚持马克思主义的阶级观点和阶级分析的方法
    ——中国青年报9月24日社论
    在阶级社会里，由于人们的阶级地位不同，人们的思想意识和政治态度也就不同；人们不论说话，做事，做人，都反映一定阶级的利益。正是因为这样，所以马克思主义者在观察人们社会生活领域一切问题的时候，必须采取阶级观点和阶级分析的方法，以便于分清敌我，明辨是非，团结自己，打击敌人。阶级观点和阶级分析方法，是马列主义理论武库中最犀利的武器之一。
    中国共产党和我们的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，就是善于使用这一武器的大师。大家知道，在中国革命的各个历史时期，在历次错综复杂、变幻莫测的社会大变动中，我们的党和毛泽东同志总是很娴熟地使用着这个武器，去科学地分析各个社会阶层的阶级状况和政治趋向，判明哪是中国革命的主力，哪是中国革命的朋友，哪是中国革命的敌人；并订出明确的纲领和策略，积聚和壮大革命力量，孤立和打击敌人，引导中国革命一步步走向胜利。
    阶级观点和阶级分析方法，对于我们共青团用共产主义精神教育青年的事业，也具有极重要的意义。这是因为，青年并非是一个独立的社会阶级（这一点和知识分子相类似），青年更不是离群索居，生活在什么“孤岛”上面。青年出身自不同的社会阶级，带来了不同社会阶级的思想意识和政治观点。青年在他的成长过程中，也不免要受到社会各阶层的旧思想影响。如果我们离开了阶级观点和阶级分析方法，可以想见，我们就势必难以分清青年中哪些人拥护革命，哪些人不赞成或反对革命，哪些人思想先进，哪些人思想落后或者反动，以及产生这些思想行为的社会历史根源等等。这样，我们对青年的政治思想状况就会感到一团模糊，就不可能帮助青年分清敌我，明辨是非，接受共产主义教育。
    应当怎样看待我国青年呢？我们认为，应当这样来看待我国青年：一方面，我国这一代青年基本上是在全国解放以后，在党和国家亲切的关怀教育下成长起来的。比起成老年一代，他们接受的旧影响较少，思想比较纯洁，容易接受新鲜事物。经过几年来的爱国主义和社会主义教育，我国青年90％几都是拥护党、拥护社会主义的。坚持反动立场，反对党反对社会主义的青年，只不过是极少数。因此总的说来，我国青年是很好的，他们的社会主义觉悟是高的。我们必须坚信青年的多数，坚信自己的力量。有些同志低估党对青年的影响，低估思想工作的成就，是不对的。
    但是，另一方面也要看到，目前我国青年很多还是出身自小资产阶级。直接从事工业劳动的青年工人，大多也还是昨天的农民、学生、城市贫民。至于在大学生中，地主、富农、资产阶级家庭出身的人，还约占30％—50％。毛泽东同志说过：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”我国青年的阶级出身既是这样的复杂，他们的童年和少年时期又都是在旧中国里度过的，这样，他们的思想深处就不能不沾染上各种不同的旧思想影响。现在，我国的生产资料的社会主义所有制虽然已经基本建立，但是在大多数青年当中，与这种所有制相适应的社会主义思想和共产主义思想，还没有树立起来。青年在大放大鸣当中暴露的一些错误思想，例如个人主义、自由主义、平均主义、反动民族主义等等，就是明证。所以，不看到我国青年尚未进行彻底的思想改造的一面，对青年的社会主义觉悟估计过高，或者认为青年已经“纯洁得像一张白纸”，不再需要“破资本主义思想，立社会主义思想”了，主要是“增长知识”“学习本领”的问题了，这显然也是不正确的。事实上，打垮旧的思想影响，比起打垮旧的制度要困难得多。我们在青年中“破资本主义思想，立社会主义思想”的任务，还将是长期的，十分艰巨的事业。
    因此，在我们向青年进行社会主义和共产主义思想教育的过程中，必须注意运用马克思主义的阶级观点和阶级分析的方法。社会主义高潮以后，有一个短的时间，有些同志只注意按照一般青年特点进行工作，比较地忽视了阶级观点和阶级分析方法，忽视了用社会主义思想和共产主义思想去严格地要求青年。这是不对的。当然，照顾青年特点是我们共青团工作的重要原则，是我们向青年进行工作的重要依据。不照顾青年特点，便不能充分发挥青年的积极性和创造性，便不能有效地进行共产主义教育，我们的工作就会脱离群众，就会出现偏差和错误。照顾青年特点的目的，是为了更好地促进青年德育、智育、体育的发展，培养青年成为有社会主义政治觉悟、有实际劳动本领和健全体魄的新的一代，为实现社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业而奋斗。
    如上所述，正因为阶级观点和阶级分析方法对我们教育青年的事业是如此重要，所以在这次大放大鸣当中，有些右派分子就对它实行了猛烈的攻击。他们在这个问题上，极尽其歪曲、污蔑之能事，恶意挑拨青年同党同共青团的亲密关系。并且异想天开地“劝导”我们，把阶级观点和阶级分析方法“抛弃”。因为右派分子曾经放出了一些似是而非的谬论，迷惑过一些心地善良但是思想糊涂的青年，因此，还有在这里加以驳斥的必要。
    右派分子的谬论之一，是说阶级分析方法已经“过时”。右派分子这种“过时论”的主要论据，据说是因为“大规模的阶级斗争已经基本结束”。其实，这是右派分子在玩弄偷偷摸摸地混淆概念的把戏，企图给人们造成一种错觉：好像“大规模”阶级斗争的“基本”结束，就是“一切”阶级斗争的“完全”结束。然而这是不可混淆的两个概念：大规模阶级斗争的基本结束，决不就等于一切阶级斗争都熄灭了。谁都知道，我国国内的阶级斗争并没有熄灭，在今后相当长时期内，还将继续充满着不同形式不同程度的阶级斗争。它包括中国人民解放台湾，同蒋介石集团的斗争，中国人民同尚未肃清的残余反革命分子的斗争，广大工农劳动者同资产阶级、同资本主义自发势力的斗争，目前人民正在进行的反右派斗争，以及人们思想领域中社会主义同资本主义的思想斗争。在国际上，也还有中国人民同帝国主义之间的斗争。所有这些，就都是阶级斗争。思想斗争是阶级斗争在人们头脑中的反映。并且，“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决”（毛泽东）。因此我们不禁要问右派先生们，你们能否认这些阶级斗争吗？既然阶级和阶级斗争都还存在，你们要我们“抛弃”阶级观点和阶级分析方法，难道不是别有用心吗！
    右派分子还拣起了早已破产的资产阶级理论的碎片，重弹“超阶级”的老调。他们大谈“人性”，而否认人的阶级性。大谈“真理”，而否认人的阶级立场，说什么“立场和真理是矛盾的，要立场就没有真理”。一些不明是非的青年，也居然听信了右派的胡言乱语，在找寻所谓“公正的裁判员立场”。
    在阶级社会和阶级斗争当中，有没有抽象的人性及所谓“裁判员立场”呢？不会有的，前面我们曾经谈到过，人不能离群索居，不能离开一定的阶级地位和社会生活。这一点，似乎连右派自己也不敢否认。既是这样，按照哲学上“共性包含于一切个性之中”的逻辑，右派分子硬要否定人的阶级性，岂不是连他自己借以生活的阶级和社会地位也都否定了吗？什么叫真理？在人们的社会生活方面，真理就是社会发展的客观规律。如果说，这种规律同资产阶级的立场有矛盾，倒是千真万确的事情。因为资产阶级靠剥削别人过活，而社会的发展规律指明：这种剥削必须消灭。无产阶级则不然，它是最先进的阶级，大公无私的阶级。社会发展的客观规律，同无产阶级自身的利益，同无产阶级解放全人类的伟大历史使命，是完全一致的。只有站在无产阶级立场上，才能掌握客观真理。至于“超阶级”理论，那更是右派分子骗人的鬼话。因为在存在阶级斗争的条件下，人们不是站在这个阶级一边，就是站在那个阶级一边。非此即彼，没有什么中间立场。右派分子要青年“超阶级”。“超”什么阶级呢？还不是“超”无产阶级，站到资产阶级那边。请想想看，还在右派分子大谈“超阶级”的时候，他们自己不正是稳稳地站在资产阶级那边，向党展开进攻的吗！有的青年说：“我只要小资产阶级立场”。其实，资产阶级和小资产阶级都属于资本主义的体系，只有一个“小”字之差罢了。又有的青年说：“我不当左派，也不当右派，而当正派”。好像这是最“公正”不过的了。但是事实上，你既然不当左派，不站在人民和社会主义一边，又有什么“正派”和“公正”可说的呢？你的这种“正派”和“公正”不是已经有利于右派，而为右派所欢迎吗！
    右派分子还假借人民内部矛盾问题大放厥词，说现在青年生活本身充满着的“只是形形色色的是非问题，而没有各种阶级思想的矛盾”。并进而反对我们考查青年的阶级出身和政治历史，反对我们在青年中划分左、中、右。说什么由于我们坚持了阶级观点和阶级分析的方法，使青年“形成了一种荒谬的是非观念”，在人与人的关系上制造了“墙”和“沟”，对教育青年起了“消极作用”和“危害作用”，等等。
    其实，“形成了一种荒谬的是非观念”的，不是别人，倒是右派分子自己。现在，反右派斗争的事实已经表明，青年中有敌我矛盾存在，有敌对思想和右派分子存在。即使在青年内部的是非问题当中，如上所述，也还是“充满着”“形形色色”的“各种阶级思想的矛盾”。既然青年中还有敌我矛盾存在，既然青年的是非问题中还充满着“各种阶级思想的矛盾”，我们的阶级观点和阶级分析的方法就一时一刻也不能抛弃。
    共青团是在党的领导下用共产主义精神教育青年的组织，而不是一个小宗派；除了国家和人民的利益，它没有任何私利。我们对青年的政治思想问题所以要进行阶级分析，首先是为了尊重事实。因为青年的阶级出身和政治历史，青年的思想意识和政治态度，并不一样，这是一个客观的存在。我们所以这样做，更重要的，是为了更好地团结青年、教育青年、帮助青年“破资本主义思想，立社会主义思想”，具有高度政治觉悟和良好道德品质。因此它是符合我们国家的利益，也符合广大青年进步的愿望和要求的。同时，我们不是机械唯物论者和“唯成分”论者。我们更重要的是看青年的目前表现。在国家的社会主义建设中的目前表现如何，是我们衡量一个青年是否进步，是否忠于社会主义的主要标准。一个青年，不管他是何种阶级出身，有何种政治历史问题，或者犯过何种错误，只要他愿意进步，愿意改正自己，都是为我们所欢迎的。在青年的政治态度和思想修养方面，或左或中或右，或进步或中间或反动，也都是根据青年自身的发展而发展的，并非一成不变的。并且我们相信：在我们国家里，由于我们事业的正义性质，由于我们党的领导的正确，和我们党对青年无微不至的关怀和教育，我国青年的绝大多数是坚决地跟着党走的，值得信赖的。即令极少数犯有严重错误的青年，只要他们不拒绝改造，也还是可以改造好的。右派分子同我们党争夺青年的阴谋，是注定要失败的。
    右派分子仇恨和攻击我们的阶级观点和阶级分析方法，并不奇怪。因为它像照妖镜一样，曾经、正在或终将弄得这些右派分子原形毕露，大出其丑。还因为，右派分子懂得，只要我们放弃了阶级观点和阶级分析方法，我们对青年的共产主义教育事业就会遭到损害，右派同我们争夺青年的奸计就可以得逞。所以，我们决不要上右派分子的当。
