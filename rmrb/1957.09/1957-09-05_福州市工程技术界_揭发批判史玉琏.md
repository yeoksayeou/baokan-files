Fuzhou Engineering Technology Circles
Expose and Criticize Shi Yulian

More than fifty engineering and technical personnel from factories and enterprises in Fuzhou recently held a forum to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Shi Yulian in engineering and technical circles.

Shi Yulian is an engineer at the Fuzhou No. 1 Machine Tool Factory. At the beginning of the Party's rectification campaign, he maliciously spread anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks among the workers. He slandered the work of joining the Party as "like joining the Triads," and clamored that the Communist Party cannot lead science and technology. Shi Yulian also took a negative attitude toward the Party's consistent emphasis on intellectuals.

    福州市工程技术界
    揭发批判史玉琏
    福州市工厂企业工程技术人员五十多人最近举行座谈会揭发和批判工程技术界右派分子史玉琏的反动言行。
    史玉琏是福州第一机器厂的工程师。在党的整风开始时，他恶毒地在职工中散布反共反社会主义言论。他诬蔑建党工作“像入青红帮一样”，叫嚣共产党不能领导科学技术。史玉琏对于党一贯重视知识分子的事实也采取否定的态度。
