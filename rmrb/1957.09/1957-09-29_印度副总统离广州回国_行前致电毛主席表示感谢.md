Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 28th: Indian Vice President Dr. Radhakrishnan left Guangzhou for home by Indian Air Force special plane at 8:00 am this morning.

Just a quarter of an hour before departure, Vice President Radhakrishnan spoke to the dense crowd of well-wishers at the airport. He said with excitement: "Although my visit was short, it is not easy to say goodbye to your smiling faces and young China."

The Indian Vice President said: "You are creating a great China with the spirit of youth." He said that the Indian people and the Indian government fully support this new and great country.

The Vice President said: "We are also building, and we all need peace. Only in peace can a new country be established." He said that the relationship between India and China, which has never had political or military disputes for more than 2,000 years, is an example. If other countries can follow this example, world peace can be guaranteed.

The Vice President concluded: "I am about to leave China, and I take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong for inviting me to visit China." He said: "I think although we are separated now, I will come again in the future."

The Indian Vice President's words were constantly interrupted by bursts of applause. The elderly doctor repeatedly clasped his hands to thank the people who had warmly come to see him off.

After the speech, Vice President Radhakrishnan warmly embraced Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, who had accompanied him for thousands of miles, and they wished each other well.

Before the Indian Vice President spoke, Vice Governor Chen Rutang of Guangdong Province spoke. He represented the people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City in wishing the Vice President a safe journey and entrusted the Vice President to extend warm greetings of friendship to the Indian people.

Before boarding the plane, Vice President Radhakrishnan, surrounded by Young Pioneers presenting flowers, bid farewell to the well-wishers one by one. Prior to this, the Vice President also paid tribute to the inspected honor guard.

Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice Governor Chen Rutang, and Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru and his wife accompanied the Vice President to the silver special plane and bid farewell again at the cabin door.

Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The full text of the telegram of thanks from Indian Vice President Dr. Radhakrishnan to Chairman Mao Zedong when leaving Guangzhou is as follows: To His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, Beijing

In half an hour, we will be taking off from Guangzhou. We have had a very wonderful time in your country, and we are deeply impressed by your achievements and aspirations. We are very grateful for your giving us this opportunity to visit and for deeply caring for us, sending Mr. Guo Moruo and a famous doctor to accompany us. We have received the most friendly treatment everywhere. For all that you have done for us, please accept our deep gratitude to you, your colleagues, and your government.

            Yours sincerely, S. Radhakrishnan, Vice President of India
          September 28, 1957, in Guangzhou

    印度副总统离广州回国
    行前致电毛主席表示感谢
    据新华社广州28日电　印度副总统拉达克里希南博士今晨八时乘坐印度空军专机离广州回国。
    在动身前一刻钟，拉达克里希南副总统在机场上对着密密层层的欢送人群讲了话。他声音激动地说：“虽然我来访问的时间很短，但是和你们满脸笑容的和年青的中国告别是不容易的事情。”
    印度副总统说：“你们是以青年的精神在创造着一个伟大的中国。”他说，对于这个新的伟大的国家，印度人民和印度政府是完全支持的。
    副总统说：“我们也在建设，我们都需要和平，只有在和平里才能建立一个新的国家。”他说，印中两国两千多年来的从未发生过政治上与军事上的争执的关系是一个榜样，如果其他国家也能按照这个榜样去做，世界和平就可得到保障。
    副总统最后说：“我就要离开中国了，我乘此机会向毛泽东主席阁下，为他邀请我访问中国表示深深的谢意。”他说：“我认为我们现在虽然分开，但我以后还会再来。”
    印度副总统的话不时被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。这位高龄的博士一再向热情地前来欢送他的人们合十致谢。
    讲话以后，拉达克里希南副总统和几千里一路陪伴着他的郭沫若副委员长热情地拥抱，互道珍重。
    在印度副总统讲话前，广东省副省长陈汝棠讲话。他代表广东省、广州市人民祝副总统一路平安，并托副总统向印度人民致热烈的友谊的问候。
    在登上飞机以前，拉达克里希南副总统在献上鲜花的少先队员们的簇拥下，同送行者一一告别。在这以前，副总统还向受检阅的仪仗队致意。
    郭沫若副委员长、陈汝棠副省长、印度驻华大使拉·库·尼赫鲁夫妇一直送副总统登上银色的专机，在机舱口再度告别。
    新华社28日讯　印度副总统拉达克里希南博士在离开广州时给毛泽东主席的感谢电，全文如下：北京中华人民共和国主席毛泽东先生阁下
    半小时之后，我们即将从广州起飞了。我们在贵国度过了一段十分美好的时光，你们的成就和抱负给了我们极深的印象。我们非常感谢你给予我们这次访问的机会，并且深切地关怀我们，派郭沫若先生和一位名医陪我们同行。我们到处都受到了最友好的招待。为了你们为我们所做的一切，谨向你、你的同事们和贵国政府表示深深的感谢。
