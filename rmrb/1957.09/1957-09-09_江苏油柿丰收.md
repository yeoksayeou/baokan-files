    Jiangsu Oil Persimmon Harvest
    Dongting Mountain oil persimmons, a special product of Jiangsu, have yielded another bumper harvest this year. According to statistics from thirty flower and fruit cooperatives, 1.32 million jin of oil persimmons have already been harvested this year, which can be processed into more than 700,000 jin of persimmon lacquer, an increase of 1.6 times compared with last year.
    Oil persimmon is a flower and fruit crop with a high oil content. Its shape is similar to a persimmon (but not edible). After simple processing, it becomes persimmon lacquer. Persimmon lacquer is an important raw material for industry and handicrafts in our country, such as for sealing boxes, painting umbrellas, doors, windows, and furniture.
    Dongting West Mountain is the only important production area of oil persimmons in our country, and it has always supplied a large amount to meet the needs of industries and handicrafts throughout the country. This year, the purchase price of oil persimmons has increased from an average of seven yuan per dan last year to twelve yuan. Currently, fruit farmers are selling the picked oil persimmons to the state in batches, and local supply and marketing cooperatives are also strengthening purchases while actively processing them into persimmon lacquer, striving to complete the purchase task ahead of schedule and above quota.

    江苏油柿丰收
    江苏特产——洞庭山油柿今年又告丰收。据三十个花果社统计，今年已经采收油柿一百三十二万斤，可加工柿漆七十多万斤，比去年增产一点六倍。
    油柿是一种含油率很高的花果作物，其外形像柿子（不能食用），经过简单加工后，即成柿漆。柿漆是我国工业和手工业的一种重要原料，如封箱、漆雨伞、门窗、家具等。
    洞庭西山是我国油柿的唯一重要产地，历年来都大量供应全国各地工业和手工业需要。今年油柿收购价格已由去年的每担平均七元提高到十二元。目前果农正在把采摘好的油柿分批卖给国家，当地供销社亦正一面加强收购，一面积极加工成柿漆，努力争取提前超额完成收购任务。（志中）
