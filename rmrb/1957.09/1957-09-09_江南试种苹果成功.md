    Apple Trial Planting Successful in Jiangnan
    Recently, a golden expanse of abundant, large apples on the slopes of Dongting Mountain in southern Jiangsu has attracted passersby. This is the first successful trial planting of apples in Jiangnan by the Dongting Xishan Horticultural Farm after five years of cultivation.

    Jiangnan has always been considered a place with high temperatures and abundant rainfall, unsuitable for apple growth. In 1953, under the guidance of Michurin's theory, the Xishan Horticultural Farm conducted trial plantings in the local area based on the characteristics of fruit trees. After five years of careful experimentation, more than ten larger fruit trees began to flower and bear over fifty fruits last year. This year, 30% of the apple trees have officially fruited, with an estimated harvest of over 200 jin of apples. According to the farm's director, the newly cultivated apple varieties include Green Banana, Guoguang, and Zhuguang, among others, with Green Banana showing the best growth.
  The successful experience of large-scale apple trial planting in Dongting Mountain not only theoretically shattered the traditional conservative view that "apples cannot be grown in the South" but also enables the people of Jiangnan to eat fresh apples in a timely manner.

    江南试种苹果成功
    江苏南部洞庭山的坡下，近来一片金黄的丰盛硕大的苹果，吸引着来往行人。这是洞庭西山园艺场经过五年培育，第一次在江南试种成功的苹果。
    江南原来一向被认为是气温高、雨水多、不适宜苹果生长的地方。1953年，西山园艺场在米丘林学说的指导下，根据果树的特性，在当地试种。他们经过五年的精心试验，去年就有十多棵生长较大的果树开始试花，生果五十多个，到今年已有30％的苹果树正式结果，预计可收苹果二百多斤。据该场场长说：新培育的苹果品种有青香蕉、国光、祝光等五种，其中以青香蕉生长最好。
  洞庭山大面积试种苹果获得成功的经验，不但从理论上打破了历来“南方不能种苹果”的保守说法，同时使江南人民也能够及时地吃到新鲜的苹果。
