Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Concludes Rectification Work Conference

(Our Newspaper) The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSL) rectification work conference concluded on the 24th of September. During the eleven-day meeting, local organizations reported on the progress of rectification and conducted self-examinations of their work. Participants agreed that the main obstacles to the TDSL's anti-rightist struggle are right-leaning thought and sentimentalism. Based on concrete facts, the meeting pointed out that the view that there are no rightists within the TDSL is incorrect. The task of the TDSL's anti-rightist struggle is extremely serious; the anti-rightist struggle is a crucial key to successfully carrying out rectification.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the TDSL is, without a doubt, a bourgeois political party. Both the league organization and individual members must undergo fundamental self-transformation. This rectification must break with the capitalist stance and establish a socialist stance, so that the TDSL becomes a political force that genuinely serves socialism.

The meeting affirmed that the vast majority of TDSL members are capable of accepting socialist transformation. From the very beginning, there has been a struggle between two lines within the TDSL. One is revolutionary and socialist, and the other is the bourgeois rightist line. This struggle is a matter of right and wrong, not a sectarian struggle as the rightists claim. The meeting hoped that members would not be deceived by the "two-faced tactics" of the rightists. It hoped that middle-of-the-road elements would turn to the left. The rightists' support for the backward aspects of the middle-of-the-road elements is neither warmth nor help, but rather leads the middle-of-the-road elements down the wrong path.

The meeting called on members in all regions to overcome right-leaning thought and sentimentalism, resolutely stand up, firmly stand their ground, and break through considerations of personal relationships to thoroughly expose and criticize rightist elements.

    台盟整风工作会议结束
    本报讯　台湾民主自治同盟整风工作会议已于24日结束。在十一天的会议上，各地方组织汇报了整风情况，并对工作进行了检查。大家认为，目前台盟反右派斗争的主要障碍是右倾思想和温情主义。会议根据具体事实，指出台盟没有右派的看法是错误的。台盟反右派斗争的任务是极其严重的；反右派斗争是搞好整风的重要关键。
    会议一致认为：台盟毫无疑问地是一个资产阶级性的政党。不论盟组织或者盟员个人都必须进行根本性的自我改造。这次整风一定要破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，使台盟成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。
    会议肯定，台盟绝大多数盟员是能够接受社会主义改造的。台盟一开始就存在着两条路线的斗争。一条是革命的、社会主义的，另一条是资产阶级右派路线。这种斗争是大是大非之争，不是如右派所说的是一种宗派斗争。会议希望盟员不要被右派的“两面手法”所迷惑。希望中间分子向左转。右派支持中间分子的落后一面，那不是温暖也不是帮助，而是使中间分子走上错误的道路。
    会议号召各地盟员克服右倾思想和温情主义，坚决地站起来，站稳立场，破除情面，对右派分子进行彻底揭露和批判。
