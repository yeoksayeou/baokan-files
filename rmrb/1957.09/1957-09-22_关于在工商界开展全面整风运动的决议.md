    The joint meeting of the Third Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Second All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce discussed the opening speech by Chairman Huang Yanpei and the report made by Chairman Chen Shutong on behalf of the standing committees of the two associations. The meeting considered that the decision to immediately launch a comprehensive rectification movement, including the struggle against the rightists, in the national industrial and commercial circles under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party was correct and timely. The meeting approved the report made by Chairman Chen Shutong on behalf of the standing committees of the two associations, and after studying and discussing the two talks made by Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made the following resolution.
    I. The meeting believes that: China is now undergoing a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, which is a struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism. Any democratic party, people's organization, and their members must pass the socialist test well in this great struggle. The political task of our two associations is to serve socialism, while our two associations are still democratic parties and people's organizations of a bourgeois nature. The socio-economic status of the majority of our two associations' members—industrialists and businessmen—has undergone significant changes since the high tide, but most of them have not yet fundamentally abandoned their reactionary capitalist stance. This contradiction between the incompatibility of nature and task, and the incompatibility of socio-economic status and political stance, has become a serious problem in our political life. If our two associations are to become democratic parties and people's organizations that are truly worthy of the name and serve socialism, and if our two associations' members and industrialists and businessmen are to adapt their political stance to their social status, and enable themselves to play an active role in the cause of socialism, we must launch a comprehensive rectification movement to fundamentally transform our political stance and at the same time change the face of our organization.
    II. The meeting believes that: the struggle against the rightists is an important key and decisive step in the comprehensive rectification movement. The purpose of the comprehensive rectification movement, with the struggle against the rightists as an important key, is to consolidate, improve, and expand the left, unite, win over, and educate the middle, and expose, isolate, and disintegrate the right, so as to lay a reliable foundation for our industrial and commercial circles to break with the capitalist stance and establish a socialist stance. In the past three months or so, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the struggle against the rightists in the industrial and commercial circles has been successful. Rightist elements such as Zhang Naqi have been exposed one by one, their ugly faces and reactionary words and deeds have gradually been recognized by the broad masses of the industrial and commercial circles, and their influence has been effectively hit. However, the reactionary remarks of rightist elements in the industrial and commercial circles still have a certain influence, and the rightist elements in the industrial and commercial circles have not been completely exposed. Therefore, the idea that the struggle against the rightists can be relaxed by launching a comprehensive rectification movement is wrong, and the idea that the struggle against the rightists is about to end is even more absurd. It must be affirmed that the current primary task is to thoroughly carry out the struggle against the rightists, and to launch the rectification movement on the basis of the victory of the struggle against the rightists.
    III. The meeting believes that: to carry out the comprehensive rectification movement well, it is necessary to do a good job in the work of the intermediate elements. Among the members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and industrialists and businessmen, the intermediate elements are the vast majority. They have varying degrees of duality in their political stance: on the one hand, they have not yet fundamentally abandoned the capitalist stance; on the other hand, they tend to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the road of socialism. Due to the education of the struggle against the rightists, many intermediate elements have now tended to turn to the left to varying degrees. Based on this situation, we confirm that intermediate elements and rightist elements are different, and must be strictly distinguished in their treatment. However, it must also be pointed out that intermediate elements also have a side of reactionary capitalist stance, which is the same as rightist elements, and it is absolutely impossible not to carry out fundamental transformation. Some people think that intermediate elements are a stereotyped class or group in society, which is wrong. In fact, the intermediate state is only temporary, and the intermediate class will always continue to disintegrate objectively. In the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism in politics and ideology, there is no middle road to take. Being content with the middle will inevitably lead to backwardness and even degenerate into rightist elements, and the future is unimaginable. Therefore, the transformation of the reactionary capitalist stance must be resolutely determined and earnestly implemented in action immediately. We must strive to transform more and more people to the left in the rectification movement. This is the sign of whether our rectification movement has truly achieved victory, and it is also a measure of the quality of our rectification leadership work.
    IV. The meeting believes that: in the comprehensive rectification movement, it is necessary to strictly distinguish in understanding and work the two different natures of contradictions faced by the struggle against the rightists and the general rectification, so as to correctly distinguish and handle the two different natures of contradictions in terms of methods and means. That is, for rightist elements, we must fight to the end, and we must thoroughly expose, isolate, and disintegrate them. The general rectification is entirely a matter within the people. We should, in accordance with the six criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, proceed from the desire for unity, adhere to the style of gentle breeze and fine rain, help each other warmly through criticism and self-criticism, rather than everyone examining themselves to pass the test; at the same time, through the great debate surrounding the major issues of rectification raised by Minister Li Weihan, we should distinguish right from wrong in politics and ideology, so as to achieve new unity on a new basis.
    V. The meeting also studied the work of our two associations in the anti-rightist struggle in the past period, and believes that: the rectification leading bodies at all levels must have a firm leading core that stands firmly on the socialist stance, and at the same time unite the forces of all parties; in our work, we must earnestly prevent and overcome the ideas of sentimentalism and right-leaning, rely closely on the leadership of the CCP Party committees, and do our work well. Because the personnel participating in the leadership work are still being transformed, and they lack experience in rectification work, it is necessary to seriously study the relevant policies of the Party while having determination and vigor, earnestly follow the mass line, and regard the work process of participating in the rectification leadership as a process of self-transformation.
    Minister Li Weihan once pointed out: "For the majority of industrialists and businessmen who welcomed the joint state-private ownership of enterprises with gongs and drums last year, we have no reason not to believe that they can take another step forward and devote themselves to the current historically significant rectification movement with the same positive attitude. We believe that as long as they actively participate in this movement, resolutely criticize and defeat the rightists, and conscientiously transform their political stance, they will surely be able to pass the socialist revolution well in politics and move steadily towards the goal of transforming into laborers."
    The meeting fully agrees with and supports Minister Li's instructions, and calls on all members of the two associations to unite with all industrialists and businessmen and their families to ensure that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will victoriously complete this glorious and arduous revolutionary task, and strive to usher in a new upsurge in accepting socialist transformation in politics and ideology!

    关于在工商界开展全面整风运动的决议
    中国民主建国会第一届中央委员会第三次全体会议、中华全国工商业联合会第二届执行委员会第二次会议联席会议讨论了黄炎培主任委员的开幕词和陈叔通主任委员代表两会常务委员会所作的报告，认为在中国共产党的领导下立即在全国工商界开展一个包括反右派斗争在内的全面整风运动的决定是正确的、适时的。会议批准陈叔通主任委员代表两会常务委员会所作的报告，并且在学习、讨论中国共产党中央统一战线工作部李维汉部长的两次谈话以后，作出如下的决议。
    一、会议认为：我国现在正在进行一次政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命，这是资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争。任何一个民主党派、人民团体和它们的成员必须在这个伟大的斗争中过好社会主义这一关。我们两会的政治任务是为社会主义服务，而我们两会还是资产阶级性质的民主党派和人民团体；我们两会成员中的主要部分——工商业者的社会经济地位在高潮以后有了重大的改变，但多数人基本上还没有抛弃资本主义的反动立场。这种性质与任务不相适应、社会经济地位与政治立场不相适应的矛盾已成为我们政治生活中的严重问题。我们两会要成为名副其实的、为社会主义服务的民主党派和人民团体，我们两会成员和工商业者要使自己的政治立场同自己的社会地位相适应，使自己能在社会主义事业中发挥积极作用，就必须开展一个全面整风运动，从根本上改造我们的政治立场，同时改变我们的组织面貌。
    二、会议认为：反右派斗争是全面整风运动的重要关键和决定性步骤。以反右派斗争为重要关键的全面整风运动的目的是：巩固、提高、扩大左派，团结、争取、教育中间派，揭露、孤立、分化右派，为我们工商界的破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场打下可靠的基础。三个多月来，在中国共产党的领导下，工商界中的反右派斗争是有成绩的，章乃器之流的右派分子一一被揭发出来，他们的丑恶面貌和反动言行已经逐渐被工商界广大群众所认识，他们的影响已经受到有力的打击，但是在工商界中右派分子的反动言论还有一定的影响，工商界中的右派分子还没有完全被揭发出来，所以那种以为开展全面整风就可以放松反右派斗争的想法是不对的，那种认为反右派斗争要结束了的想法更是荒谬的。必须肯定：当前的首要任务，就是彻底进行反右派斗争，并且在反右派斗争胜利的基础之上开展整风运动。
    三、会议认为：要很好地开展全面整风运动，必须做好对中间分子的工作。民建会员和工商业者中，中间分子是绝大多数。他们在政治立场上具有不同程度的两面性：一方面基本上还没有抛弃资本主义立场；另一方面，又倾向于接受共产党的领导，走社会主义的道路。由于反右派斗争的教育，目前有很多的中间分子已在不同程度上有向左转的倾向。根据这种情况，我们确认：中间分子和右派分子是不同的，在对待上必须严格地加以区别。但是，必须同时指出：中间分子也有资本主义反动立场的一面，这是他们同右派分子相同的地方，不进行根本的改造，断然是不行的。有人以为中间分子是社会上定型的阶层或者集团，这是不对的。事实上，中间状态只是暂时的，中间阶层在客观上总是要不断分化的，在政治上思想上资本主义和社会主义谁战胜谁的两条道路的斗争中，是没有中间道路可走的，安于中间，必然会导向落后乃至堕落成为右派分子，前途是不堪设想的。因此，对资本主义反动立场的改造必须痛下决心，并且立即在行动上认真贯彻。我们必须在整风运动中努力争取愈来愈多的人向左转化。这是我们整风运动是否真正获得胜利的标志，也是衡量我们整风领导工作做得好坏的尺度。
    四、会议认为：在全面整风运动中，必须在认识上和工作上严格区别反右派斗争和一般整风面对着的两种不同性质的矛盾，从而正确地区别处理这两种性质不同的矛盾的方式方法。这就是，对于右派分子，必须斗争到底，必须对他们彻底地加以揭露、孤立和分化。一般整风则完全是人民内部的事，应当依据毛主席指示的六项标准，从团结的愿望出发，坚持和风细雨的方式，通过批评与自我批评，热情地相互帮助，而不是人人检讨过关；同时，通过围绕李维汉部长所提出的关于整风的重大问题的大辩论，在政治上思想上辨明是非，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。
    五、会议还研究了我们两会以往一个时期中的反右派斗争的工作情况，认为：各级整风领导机构必须有坚定的站稳社会主义立场的领导核心，同时团结各方面的力量；要在工作中认真地防止和克服温情主义与右倾思想，紧紧依靠中共党委的领导，做好我们的工作。由于我们参加领导工作的人员自己还在改造之中，对于整风工作缺乏经验，因此需要在有决心、有劲头的同时，认真学习党的有关政策，切实走群众路线，把参加整风领导的工作过程看作自我改造的过程。
    李维汉部长曾经指出：“对于去年敲锣打鼓迎接企业公私合营的大多数工商业者，我们没有理由不相信他们能够再前进一步，以同样积极的态度投入当前这一场有历史意义的整风运动。我们相信：他们只要积极地参加这个运动，坚决地批判和打垮右派，认真地改造自己的政治立场，就一定能够在政治上过好社会主义革命这一关，平平稳稳地向着改造成为劳动者的目标前进的。”
    会议完全同意而且拥护李部长的这一指示，并且号召两会的全体会员同所有的工商业者和工商业者的家属们团结起来，为保证在中国共产党的领导下，胜利的完成这一光荣而艰巨的革命任务，为掀起在政治上思想上接受社会主义改造的新高潮而奋斗！　1957年9月21日
