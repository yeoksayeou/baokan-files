Xinhua News Agency, September 13th, Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on the 12th that Syria is ready to deal with all eventualities.

He said that nothing can frighten us, because we have full confidence in the rights we are defending and in the support given to us by the people of Arab countries and the free world for this.

Al-Assali also pointed out that cabinet members are meeting every day to study the situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 13th: Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief General Afif Bizri said in an exclusive interview with Middle East News Agency reporters on September 12th that Syria has not been frightened by the threats from the United States. The Syrian people are determined to defend their freedom; they are prepared to deal with any situation, fulfill their obligations and achieve victory. He said that Syria is not isolated on the earth. We are not alone in the world in dealing with the imperialists.

Bizri arrived in Cairo on September 11th with the head of the Syrian Army Intelligence Department, Sarraj. After meeting with President Nasser and Egyptian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Amer, they left Cairo on September 12th to return home.

Bizri said that his visit to Cairo was to study the general situation. The Syrian army and the Egyptian army are one, and they have a unified plan.

When talking about the relationship between Syria and the United States, Bizri said: "Syria is not responsible for the current state of Syrian-US relations. We ignore the threats from the United States."

When talking about the relationship between Syria and the Soviet Union, he said that the relationship between Syria and the Soviet Union is a normal relationship between two signatories of the United Nations Charter.

He emphasized that Syria's weapons are for defense, not for aggression. He said that Syria has no colonies to maintain, nor markets to exclude competitors.

Bizri told a reporter from the Cairo newspaper "Al-Ahram" on the same day: "We are ready to deal with all eventualities. If the imperialists want to attack Syria, the entire world will fight with it, including the united Syrian people supported by the people of the invading country." He warned the imperialists to learn a lesson from the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel.

Bizri said that the coup that the United States planned to launch in Syria was originally to be led by former Syrian President Shishakli and the Syrian military attaché in Rome, Husseini. They were used by the imperialists as tools to lure Syrian army officers to participate in the conspiracy.

He said: The Americans "thought that the dollar could do everything, and ignored the fact that in countries where only honor and dignity are valuable, the dollar has no place. The money they paid to the officers who they thought were on their side has already become ours, and we will use this money to search for their agents."

　　叙总理和武装部队总司令说
　　叙利亚准备好应付一切事变
    新华社13日讯  大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利12日说，叙利亚已经准备好应付一切事变。
    他说，什么也不能吓住我们，因为我们对我们所保卫的权利以及阿拉伯各国人民和自由世界为此而给予我们的支持具有充分信心。
    阿萨利还指出，内阁阁员每天在开会研究局势。
    据新华社开罗13日电  叙利亚武装部队总司令阿菲弗·比兹里将军9月12日在单独接见中东通讯社记者时说，叙利亚没有被美国的威胁吓倒。叙利亚人民决心要保卫他们的自由；准备应付任何局势，履行他们的义务和取得胜利。他说，叙利亚在地球上不是孤立的。我们在世界上并不是单独对付帝国主义者的。
    比兹里是在9月11日偕同叙利亚陆军情报处长萨拉杰到达开罗的，他们在同纳赛尔总统和埃及武装部队总司令阿密尔会谈后，已在9月12日离开开罗回国。
    比兹里说，他这次到开罗是来研究一般的局势的。叙利亚军队同埃及军队是一体的，它们有着统一的计划。
    在谈到叙利亚同美国的关系的时候，比兹里说：“对于叙美关系的现状，叙利亚不负任何责任。我们对美国的威胁置之不理。”
    在谈到叙苏关系时，他说，叙苏关系是联合国宪章的两个签字国之间的正常关系。
    他强调说，叙利亚的武器是为了进行防御，而不是为了侵略。他说，叙利亚并没有殖民地要维持，也没有市场要排斥竞争者。
    比兹里在同一天对开罗“金字塔报”记者说：“我们已经准备好对付一切万一情况。假如帝国主义要进攻叙利亚，同它交战的将是全世界，其中包括侵略国的人民支持的团结一致的叙利亚人民。”他警告帝国主义者应该从英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及事件中接受教训。
    比兹里说，美国策划要在叙利亚发动的政变原定由前叙利亚总统施舍克里和叙利亚驻罗马的武官侯赛尼领导。他们被帝国主义利用为引诱叙利亚陆军军官来参加阴谋活动的工具。
    他说：美国人“以为美元可以做到一切事情，而忽视了这一事实：在只有荣誉和尊严才有价值的国家里，美元是没有地位的。他们所付给他们自以为是站在他们一边的军官的钱，已经归我们所有了，我们就用这些钱来搜索他们的特务。”
