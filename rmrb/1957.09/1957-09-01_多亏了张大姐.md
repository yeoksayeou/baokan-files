    Thanks to Sister Zhang
    Tao Lai
    In the Xuchang Cigarette Factory, there was a female worker named Kou Xiuying. She and her husband both longed for a child. The couple often got angry about this, even to the point of arguing for divorce. Kou Xiuying was very distressed, and her production morale was often affected. In 1954, the factory conducted a physical examination for all female workers, and Kou Xiuying discovered she had endometritis, which prevented her from conceiving. This disease could be treated at the Municipal People's Hospital, but the People's Hospital was far from the factory, and it wasn't something that could be cured in just a few visits. Gradually, she became too lazy to go. There were also some female workers in the factory who had this disease. Zhang Xiuyun, the female workers' committee member of the trade union, saw this situation and suggested that the administration establish a women's health clinic. The administration accepted this suggestion, but they couldn't find a health worker. Zhang Xiuyun volunteered to go to the People's Hospital to learn. Things she couldn't learn quickly, she continued to study in her spare time. Gradually, she learned simple treatment methods such as douching, administering medicine, and giving injections. From then on, Zhang Xiuyun, regardless of wind or rain, regardless of whether it was early or late, or on Sundays, would enthusiastically treat female workers whenever they came to her with illnesses. Kou Xiuying's endometritis gradually improved after long-term douching. Last year, she had a chubby baby. Her husband no longer argued for divorce, and the couple's relationship was very good. Kou Xiuying, who had always been taciturn, now became talkative and cheerful, as if she had become a different person. Kou Xiuying often said to people, "Thanks to Sister Zhang, thanks to our health clinic!" (Attached picture)

    陶来
    许昌烟厂有个女工叫寇秀英，和爱人俩都盼着有个小孩子。夫妇俩还常为这件事生气，甚至闹着要离婚。寇秀英很苦恼，生产情绪也常受影响。1954年，全厂女工进行了身体大检查，寇秀英发现自己有子宫炎，所以不能生育。这种病可以去市人民医院治疗，但是人民医院离工厂远，又不是三两次可以治好的，慢慢地她就懒得去了。工厂里还有一些女工也生这种病，工会女工委员张秀云看到这种情况，就建议行政成立妇女卫生室。行政方面接受这个建议，但找不到卫生员。张秀云就主动到人民医院去学习。一时学不会的东西，就利用业余时间继续学。慢慢地，她学会了冲洗、上药和打针等简便治疗方法。从这以后，张秀云不管刮风下雨，不管天早天晚和星期天，只要女工有病找她，她都热心去治。寇秀英的子宫炎经过长期冲洗，慢慢好了。去年，她添了一个胖娃娃，她爱人再也不闹着离婚了，夫妇俩感情非常好。向来沉默寡言的寇秀英，现在变得有说有笑，像换了个人似的。寇秀英常对人说：“多亏了张大姐，多亏了咱们的卫生室。”（附图片）
