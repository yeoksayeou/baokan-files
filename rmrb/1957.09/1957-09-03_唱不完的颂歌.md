    An Endless Song of Praise
    Liang Shangquan
    Mother bore me, father raised me,
    The motherland nurtured me to adulthood;
    Motherland, oh motherland,
    You are an endless song of praise for me!
    When I was young, I loved my birthdays most,
    My parents would always call my childhood name and softly say:
    "You've grown another year older!"
    Every strand of my hair was filled with joy.
    Like a fledgling bird whose feathers haven't fully grown,
    I wanted to quickly grow strong wings and fly out of the nest,
    To find food and repay my hardworking mother,
    Not hesitating to fly all over the world!
    A refugee child once told me,
    That the Japanese invaders had reached the foot of Dushan Mountain.
    I cried, thinking I could no longer
    Use the language of my motherland, sing the songs of my motherland!
    Another refugee from Fenglingdu said,
    That the Eighth Route Army's divine soldiers were as powerful as the Yellow River.
    I smiled, and had a good dream at night,
    Dreaming of the defeated enemy sinking into the red waves!
    Motherland! You were still full of disasters and difficulties then,
    But I loved the mountains behind the house, the river in front of the door,
    The fragrant calamus and weeds by the river,
    The frogs and crickets chirping urgently in the wilderness...
    Now, I have become a Communist Youth League member,
    Every birthday I always remain silent for a long time:
    "You've passed another year, comrade!"
    But what have I done for the motherland this year?
    I think of Ding Youjun, who is the same age as me,
    A fighter facing the enemy,
    She stood majestically like a bunker,
    Sacrificing herself for a better life for the earth!
    Her breath will continue for countless centuries,
    Forever stirring the pulse of young people:
    I will take over the baton of the martyrs,
    Running to catch up with the motherland advancing a thousand miles a day!
    Mother bore me, father raised me,
    Born and raised for the motherland;
    Motherland, oh motherland,
    You are an endless song of praise for me!

    唱不完的颂歌
    梁上泉
    妈妈生我，爹爹养我，
    抚育我成人的是祖国；
    祖国妈妈呵，祖国妈妈，
    你是我唱不完的颂歌！
    小时候，最爱过生日，
    爹妈总叫着乳名轻声说：
    “你又长了一岁啦！”
    我每根头发都充满欢乐。
    像一只羽毛未丰的小鸟，
    想快长硬翅膀飞出巢窝，
    寻食反哺劳苦的母亲，
    不惜飞遍天涯海角！
    曾有个逃难的孩子告诉我，
    说日寇打到了独山脚。
    我哭了，心想再也不能
    用祖国的语言，唱祖国的歌！
    又有个来自风陵渡的难民，
    说八路军的神兵势如黄河。
    我笑了，夜里做了个好梦，
    梦见溃败的敌人沉入红波！
    祖国！你那时还多灾多难，
    但我爱着屋后的山，门前的河，
    那河边清香的菖蒲和水草，
    那山野急叫的青蛙和蟋蟀……
    如今，我成了一个共青团员，
    每逢生日总要久久地沉默：
    “你又过了一岁啦，同志！”
    可这一年给祖国做了些什么？
    想起与我同岁的丁佑君，
    一位面对敌人的战斗者，
    她威严地站着像一座碉堡，
    牺牲了，为大地更好的生活！
    她的呼吸要延续无数世纪，
    永远鼓荡年青人的脉搏：
    我要接过烈士的接力棒，
    跑步追赶一日千里的祖国！
    妈妈生我，爹爹养我，
    生我养我是为了祖国；
    祖国妈妈呵，祖国妈妈，
    你是我唱不完的颂歌！
