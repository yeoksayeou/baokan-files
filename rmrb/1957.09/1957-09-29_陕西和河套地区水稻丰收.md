Shaanxi Province will achieve a rice harvest this year despite multiple disasters. This year, more than two million mu of rice were planted in southern Shaanxi, northern Shaanxi, and the Guanzhong area. According to the harvested crops in Hanzhong, Ankang, and other regions, as well as the Guanzhong area, yields have exceeded the bumper harvest of 1956. Hanzhong Prefecture, a famous rice-producing area that accounts for two-thirds of the province's planting area, estimates that the average yield per mu of its 1.5 million mu of rice will increase by about 4% compared to last year, and the total output will increase by more than 8% compared to last year. Xixiang County, which has had four consecutive years of bumper harvests, saw its total output of more than 200,000 mu of rice increase by more than 11 million jin compared to last year, accounting for 11% of last year's total output. This year, many high-yield fields have emerged in various places. In Jiangjiabang Agricultural Cooperative in Xixiang County, there were 160 mu of rice with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, an increase of eight times compared to last year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 28th: More than 100,000 mu of rice in the Hetao Plain of Inner Mongolia have yielded a bumper harvest. The rice fields along the Wujia River are golden, and harvesting began in early September.
