Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Right-wingers Hua Lanhong and Chen Zhanxiang, who opposed the Communist Party's leadership in urban construction and attempted to replace the socialist direction of urban construction with a capitalist one, have been refuted into speechlessness by people in the capital's architectural circles in seven large and small debates recently.

Hua Lanhong and Chen Zhanxiang are the chief engineers of the Beijing Municipal Design Institute. With a hostile attitude, they slandered the "Preliminary Draft of the Overall Plan for Beijing," formulated under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee, calling this plan a so-called "celestial book" and "armchair theorizing, detached from the masses, and formalism." They advocated abolishing the overall plan and using the capitalist method of "metabolism and cyclical construction" to blindly and spontaneously build Beijing. Therefore, they made a series of malicious attacks on the Party.

In order to counter the right-wingers' vicious attacks and clarify the major issues of right and wrong in urban construction, the capital's architectural circles have successively held seven large and small debates. Chu Chuanheng, head of the Economic Data Group of the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission, refuted Chen Zhanxiang's claim that the preliminary draft of Beijing's overall plan was "armchair theorizing and detached from the masses" with a wealth of facts. He said that since May 1955, the Municipal Planning Commission, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee, had mobilized more than 20,000 people to spend half a year conducting investigations and research on more than a dozen aspects related to urban construction, such as natural conditions, population, industry, roads, and rivers and lakes. When the planning draft reached a certain stage, four large-scale exhibitions were held to solicit opinions from more than 16,000 visitors, and the planning scheme was further revised based on the correct opinions raised by the visitors. In the three years from 1954 to 1957, more than 800 municipal construction projects were arranged according to the planning scheme. Chu Chuanheng questioned Chen Zhanxiang: "You visited the long-term planning, short-term planning, and first-phase planning schemes of the planning plan, why do you say that 'the overall planning scheme is for the distant future and cannot guide practice'!"

Architects and engineers at the meeting cited many facts to criticize Hua Lanhong's slander that "capital construction in the past few years is not as good as before" and that "the failure of urban construction is the main thing," as well as Chen Zhanxiang's clamor that "the Communist Party lacks the same vigor as it did when filling Longxu Ditch." The meeting pointed out that before liberation, the total construction area of larger engineering companies in Beijing, such as Jintai and Longhu, was only tens of thousands of square meters in a few years. At that time, a three-story building with a construction area of 2,000 square meters was considered a major project. From the time of liberation to the end of 1957, the newly built housing area in Beijing would reach 20 million square meters, exceeding the total housing area built in Beijing for hundreds of years. After filling Longxu Ditch, the Party and the government have eliminated ten "Longxu Ditches" in the past few years, and are now gradually turning the largest "Longxu Ditch" in the urban area—the moat—into a clear water river, and transforming the stinking ditches such as Longtan and Taoranting into beautiful parks. The number of public water stations installed in the residential areas of the working people and in some rural areas in the suburbs has increased nearly tenfold compared with the early days of liberation.

The meeting further refuted another poisonous arrow released by Hua Lanhong—a complete negation of the achievements of civil architecture in recent years, and inciting discord between the Communist Party and the masses. Speakers used many facts to prove that these words were groundless. Engineer Zhong Guosheng calculated the accounts: Since liberation, the area of public buildings built in Beijing is nearly 7 million square meters, most of which are houses for government agencies, universities and colleges, and scientific research institutions. These public buildings are necessary to cultivate construction cadres, conduct scientific research, and create working conditions for the central ministries. However, Hua Lanhong maliciously slandered this as "consumption-oriented construction." During this period, many new houses for residential use were also built, with an area of 7.46 million square meters, which is equal to three times the area of all buildings built in the 18 years before liberation. During the Kuomintang rule, the working people had nowhere to live and could only live in places such as "Caochang Great Pit" and "Qiangchang Great Pit" filled with garbage. Before liberation, there were more than 200 such places in the city. When it rained, the beds of some residents could float, and their lives were in danger if the houses collapsed. After liberation, the government built sewers in these places and helped residents repair their houses. Is this not the Party and the government caring about the suffering of the people? Construction worker Zhang Cai used many vivid facts to prove that before liberation, construction workers lived in shacks built with a few bamboo poles and a few mats; now, the government has built 300,000 square meters of brick and wood structured dormitories for construction workers. Zhang Cai questioned Hua Lanhong: "You said that 'the living standards of the people have decreased by 30%', now that you have heard the facts I have said, has it decreased or increased!"

Hua Lanhong and Chen Zhanxiang have always hated the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for strengthening its leadership over the overall plan. They spread everywhere that the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was "sectarianism." Until recently, when their rumors and slanders were exposed one by one, they still insisted that what they opposed was the "sectarianism" of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in leading the overall plan. This statement aroused the indignation of the architects present at the meeting, and questions poured onto the rostrum like snowflakes. Chu Chuanheng refuted this black-and-white attack with facts. He said that every planning scheme currently formulated has the participation of non-Party architects, and the planning of the central areas such as the railway planning, Tiananmen Square, and East and West Chang'an Avenue are mainly responsible for by non-Party architects. Zhang Bo, chief engineer of the Municipal Design Institute, questioned Hua Lanhong and Chen Zhanxiang: "The Beijing Municipal Planning Commission has absorbed many non-Party architects to jointly formulate the plan, and I am one of them. Is it 'sectarianism' without the participation of you two?"

Hua Lanhong was speechless in the face of these facts. He only said that his "motive was good, but the effect was not good." At this time, architect Pan Changhou, who had been dragged into the water by Hua Lanhong, angrily revealed on the spot: "When I helped you organize the 'ten thousand word letter', you clearly stated that the central idea was to explain that 'failure is the main thing, and achievements can be said to be non-existent.' Can this be said that your motive is good?"

More than 40 people in the architectural circles spoke at these large and small meetings held by the Beijing Branch of the Architectural Society of China.

    首都建筑界展开大论战
    华揽洪陈占祥恶意攻击首都建设的种种谬论一一破产
    据新华社4日讯　反对共产党领导城市建设、企图用资本主义城市建设方向来代替社会主义城市建设方向的右派分子华揽洪、陈占祥，最近在七次大小辩论会上，被首都建筑界人士驳得理屈词穷。
    华揽洪和陈占祥是北京市设计院的总工程师。他们抱着仇视的态度，污蔑在中共北京市委和市人民委员会领导下制订的“北京市总体规划初步方案”，说这个方案是一本所谓“天书”，是“闭门造车，脱离群众，形式主义”。他们主张取消总体规划，主张用资本主义的 “新陈代谢，循环建设”的方法来盲目地自发地建设北京。因而他们对党作了一系列恶意的攻击。
    为了反击右派分子的恶毒的进攻，辩明城市建设方面的大是大非，首都建筑界已先后召开了七次大小辩论会。北京市都市规划委员会经济资料组组长储传亨以大量的事实，驳斥陈占祥所谓北京的总体规划初步方案是“闭门造车、脱离群众”的说法。他说，从1955年5月份开始，市都市规划委员会在中共北京市委和市人民委员会领导下，曾先后动员了两万多人，用半年时间，对有关城市建设的自然条件、人口、工业、道路、河湖等十几项现状进行了调查研究。当规划草图进行到一定阶段时，又先后举行过四次大规模展览，征求过一万六千多个参观者的意见，并根据参观者提出的正确的意见，进一步修改了规划方案。在1954年到1957年的三年中，共有八百多项市政建设工程是根据规划方案布置的。储传亨质问陈占祥：“你参观过规划方案的远景规划、近期规划和第一期规划方案，为什么说‘总体规划方案是遥远将来的日子，无法指导实际’！”
    建筑师和工程师们在会上列举许多事实，批驳了华揽洪关于“首都几年来的建设今不如昔”、“城市建设失败是主要的”的污蔑，以及陈占祥所谓“共产党缺乏当年填平龙须沟那么一股劲”的叫嚣。会上指出：解放前，北京比较大的基泰、龙虎等工程公司，几年的建筑面积总和才只有几万平方公尺。那时候，建筑面积有两千平方公尺的三层楼就算大工程了。解放后到1957年底止，北京新建的房屋面积就将达到两千万平方公尺，超过北京城几百年来所建房屋面积的总数。党和政府继填平龙须沟之后，几年来又消灭了十条“龙须沟”，现在正在逐步地把城区最大的“龙须沟”——护城河变成清水河，把龙潭、陶然亭等臭水沟改变成美丽的公园。在劳动人民居住地区和郊区部分农村安装的公共用水站，比解放初期增加了近十倍。
    会上进一步驳斥了华揽洪放出的另一枝毒箭——全盘否定几年来民用建筑的成就，挑拨共产党和群众的关系。发言的人用许多事实证明，这些话是毫无根据的。工程师钟国生算了一笔账：解放以来，北京盖的公共建筑物的面积近七百万平方公尺，其中大部分是供机关、高等学校和科学研究机构用的房屋。这些公共建筑物为了培养建设干部、进行科学研究、给中央各部创造工作条件，都是必要盖的。而华揽洪则别有用心地污蔑说这是“消费性建筑”。在这个期间，也盖了许多新的供居住用的房屋，面积达到七百四十六万平方公尺，等于解放前十八年中建的所有建筑物面积的三倍。在国民党统治时候，劳动人民无处居住，只能住在用垃圾填垫起来的“草厂大坑”、“枪厂大坑”等地方。这样的地方解放前城内共有二百多处，一到下雨的时候，有些住户的床铺都能漂得起来，房子塌了生命难保。解放后，政府在这些地方修了下水道，帮助居民修缮了房屋。这难道是党和政府不关心人民疾苦吗？建筑工人张才用许多活生生的事实来证明，解放前建筑工人住的是用几根竹竿、几张席子搭起的窝棚；现在，政府给建筑工人盖了三十万平方公尺砖木结构的宿舍楼。张才追问华揽洪：“你说‘人民居住水平下降30％’，现在你听了我讲的这些事实，到底是降低了，还是提高了！”
    华揽洪和陈占祥对中共北京市委加强对总体规划的领导，一直仇恨。他们到处散播说中共北京市委是“宗派主义”。直到最近，当他们的造谣污蔑被一一戳穿以后，他们仍一口咬定他们反对的是中共北京市委领导总体规划的“宗派主义做法”。这种说法，引起到会建筑师的激愤，质问的条子像雪片似地送到主席台上。储传亨用事实驳斥了这种颠倒黑白的攻击。他说，现在所制定的每一项规划方案，都有党外建筑师参加，其中像铁路规划、天安门广场、东西长安街等中心区的规划，并且都是由党外建筑师主要负责。市设计院总工程师张镈质问华揽洪、陈占祥说：“北京市都市规划委员会吸收了许多党外建筑师来共同制订规划，我就是其中一个。难道没有你们两个参加，就是‘宗派主义’吗？”
    华揽洪面对这些事实，无言对答。只说他“动机是好的，效果不好”。这时，曾被华揽洪拉下水的建筑师潘昌侯，当场气愤地揭露：“当我帮你整理‘万言书’时，你明确地声言，中心思想要说明‘失败是主要的，成绩可以说没有。’这难道能说你的动机是好的吗？”
    在中国建筑学会北京分会召开的这些大会和小会上，发言的建筑界人士有四十多人。
