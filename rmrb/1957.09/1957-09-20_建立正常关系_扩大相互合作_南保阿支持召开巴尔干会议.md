Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, the governments of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania have successively supported the convening of a high-level conference of government representatives from Balkan countries.

President Tito of Yugoslavia, in his reply to a letter from Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Stoica, expressed support for the suggestion made in his letter of September 10 regarding the convening of a high-level conference of government representatives from Balkan countries. He said: "I believe that a meeting of heads of government from Balkan countries would be an important step towards establishing and developing friendly cooperation between all Balkan countries."

President Tito considered Chairman Stoica's suggestion to be very beneficial. He said: "The realization of these suggestions would benefit the people of the Balkans, contribute to their overall development, and consolidate European security and international peace." He concluded: "I would like to emphasize that I and my government wholeheartedly support the motives that prompted you to write this letter and the spirit of peace and friendship that permeates your suggestions."

The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency broadcast on the 18th the Bulgarian Council of Ministers' reply to Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Stoica.

The reply stated that, based on the interests of the Bulgarian people and their desire to live in harmony with all peoples, especially with all neighboring Balkan countries, the Bulgarian government fully accepts the Romanian government's suggestion and agrees to participate in the meeting of leaders of governments from Balkan countries. The Bulgarian government believes that, due to the joint efforts of the countries concerned, the tension in relations between Balkan countries in recent years has been considerably eased. Therefore, it can be reasonably believed that the realization of this initiative by the Romanian government will help to establish completely normal and friendly relations between Balkan countries and expand mutual cooperation. Regarding the venue for the meeting, the Bulgarian government agrees to Bucharest, but does not object to any other Balkan capital.

Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Shehu, stated in a letter replying to Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Stoica, that the Albanian government approves of the suggestion made by the Romanian government to convene a high-level conference of representatives from Balkan countries this year.

The reply letter pointed out that by establishing the necessary conditions for expanding economic and cultural ties between Balkan countries, their cooperation will contribute to mutual reconciliation and help create a good atmosphere of trust.

　　南保阿支持召开巴尔干会议
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：南斯拉夫、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等国政府，相继支持召开巴尔干各国政府最高级代表会议。
    南斯拉夫总统铁托复信给罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡，对他在9月10日的信中提出的关于召开巴尔干各国政府最高级代表会议的建议表示支持。他说：“我觉得，巴尔干各国政府首脑举行一次会议将是走向建立和发展所有巴尔干国家间友好合作的一个重要步骤。”
    铁托总统认为斯托伊卡主席的建议非常有益处。他说：“实现这些建议会有利于巴尔干人民，将对他们的全面发展有所贡献，并且将巩固欧洲安全和国际和平。”他最后说：“我愿强调指出，我和我的政府衷心支持促使你写这封信的动机和你的建议中洋溢的和平和友好精神。”
    保加利亚通讯社18日广播了保加利亚部长会议致罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡的复函。
    复函表示，根据保加利亚人民的利益和他们同各国人民，特别是同所有巴尔干邻国人民友好相处的愿望，保加利亚政府完全接受罗马尼亚政府的建议，同意参加巴尔干各国政府领导人的会议。保加利亚政府认为，由于有关国家的共同努力，近几年巴尔干各国关系的紧张状态已经有了相当的缓和。因此可以有根据地认为，罗马尼亚政府这一倡议的实现将有助于建立巴尔干各国间完全正常的友好关系和扩大相互间的合作。关于会议举行地点，保加利亚政府同意在布加勒斯特，但是也不反对在任何其他巴尔干国家的首都。
    阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡在一封答复罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡的信件中表示，阿尔巴尼亚政府赞同罗马尼亚政府提出的在今年召开巴尔干各国最高级代表会议的建议。
    复信指出，通过建立扩大巴尔干各国间的经济和文化联系所必需的条件，它们之间的合作将有助于彼此的和解，有助于创造出信任的良好气氛。
