Around the Opening of the United Nations General Assembly

The 12th United Nations General Assembly has opened. In what kind of international situation is this session being held?

The Situation Before the Meeting

Since the forces of world peace and progress crushed the imperialist offensives on the two fronts of Egypt and Hungary, the once-tense international situation has gradually eased. However, the imperialist forces are not reconciled to their defeat. Relying on its huge war machine and its control over capitalist countries, the United States has intensified its efforts to create international tensions and instigate new incidents in order to achieve its anti-peace, anti-national independence, and anti-socialist goals. Its two main activities in this regard are: intensifying the implementation of the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, and colluding with Britain, France, Canada, and other countries to undermine the work of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee. The United States took advantage of the tense atmosphere it stirred up in the Middle East and the difficulties it created in disarmament negotiations to pass an unprecedentedly large military budget in peacetime, further promoting plans to organize military aggression groups, and actively preparing for atomic war in various regions of the world. At the same time, Britain also launched new colonial aggressions in the Persian Gulf region and actively expanded its nuclear armaments. France has also intensified its colonial war against the Algerian people.

In order to cover up their activities of expanding armaments, preparing for war, and pursuing colonialism, Western countries fabricated and vigorously hyped the so-called "Hungarian question," and forced the United Nations General Assembly to hold a special session to discuss it before the opening of the 12th session, while vigorously publicizing the so-called "Communist infiltration of the Middle East" in order to divert international public attention.

However, the imperialist activities against peace, national independence, and socialism have been countered by the united forces of peace, national independence, and socialism. The Eisenhower Doctrine has suffered serious setbacks in Syria and Egypt, and the disguise of American colonialism has been torn off. The military actions of Britain and France in carrying out colonial aggression have also fallen into difficulties and have been widely condemned by international public opinion. On the issue of disarmament, according to the admission of "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Drummond, the Western countries' efforts to deceive public opinion and shirk responsibility "have definitely lost."

Because the Soviet Union has become the first country in the world to master intercontinental ballistic missiles, the United States' policy of atomic blackmail has completely gone bankrupt, and the world's forces against war and imperialism have been greatly encouraged, and more courageously and confidently given imperialism a firm blow on various fronts. The contradictions within imperialism have become more acute. The recent struggles between the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East and North Africa and the differences in their military policies illustrate this point.

The Struggle of Two Forces

The imperialist forces, headed by the United States, regard the United Nations General Assembly, which is manipulated by their mechanical majority, as a tool that can help to reverse their decline. They hope to use the United Nations General Assembly as a shield to resist the accusations of world public opinion against them, and at the same time use it as a spearhead to shift the pressure of international public opinion against the Soviet Union. Dulles' opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly was aimed at achieving this goal. His speech focused on the two issues of disarmament and the Middle East situation, because it is precisely on these two issues related to the fundamental interests of imperialism that imperialism is currently in the most embarrassing situation.

At present, the pressure for disarmament, especially for stopping nuclear testing and banning atomic weapons, is increasing. If an agreement is reached on the issue of disarmament, the arms race will stop, and the international situation will be greatly eased, which will make it impossible for the United States to continue to pursue its policy of aggression and war preparation. At the same time, the resistance to the United States' implementation of the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East is also increasing. If this aggressive plan is declared bankrupt, the United States' entire war policy will suffer an extremely serious blow. In order to reverse this situation, Dulles, in his speech, called black white, reversed right and wrong, and tried to completely shift all the responsibility for obstructing disarmament and creating turmoil in the Middle East to the Soviet Union, and used the United Nations as a cover to protect the United States' more blatant interference in the Middle East and support its position of obstructing disarmament. Dulles' lead was echoed by Britain, France, and other followers.

It can be foreseen that at the 12th United Nations General Assembly, the forces of peace and anti-colonialism will launch a tit-for-tat and extremely sharp struggle with the forces of war and imperialism around these major issues.

The Situation is Unfavorable to Imperialism

Although imperialism controls the majority of the General Assembly, the situation of the struggle is very unfavorable to imperialism.

On the issue of disarmament, although Western countries have made every effort to put on various postures of willingness to reach an agreement, and have also put forward a so-called "joint proposal," the result has not achieved the goal of deceiving public opinion. Regarding this point, the above-mentioned "New York Herald Tribune" reporter had to admit: "The Western approach to disarmament is not understood by people, and is definitely not accepted by the general countries of the world. It has certainly not been successful here in Western Europe, and I also doubt whether it has given the American people a clear impression." The reporter's opinion reflects the predicament of Western countries. In the face of the simple and clear disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, it is very difficult to find pleasant excuses for the West to escape the pressure of world public opinion.

As for the Middle East issue, colonial imperialism has already revealed its ferocious features in this regard. The Eisenhower Doctrine is more brutal than the British and French imperialism. But the people of Syria and Egypt are firm, the people of Arab countries are closely united, and their anti-imperialist struggle has been strongly supported by the peace-loving and national independence-respecting people of all countries, especially the powerful socialist countries. This situation makes it necessary for imperialism to think twice before carrying out direct armed intervention. Activities of division and subversion are also more difficult. The majority voting machine of the United Nations is equally powerless in the face of this situation.

It is precisely because they are morally untenable that the imperialist bloc deliberately disregards Hungary's sovereignty and forcibly puts the fabricated "Hungarian question" on the agenda of the General Assembly. They want to resort to this despicable trick to divert the attention of the General Assembly, influence the discussions of the General Assembly, and prevent the General Assembly from dealing with important and urgent issues such as disarmament and imperialist aggression and interference in the Middle East.

The Central Issue is Peaceful Coexistence

On the agenda of the 12th United Nations General Assembly, there are dozens of large and small issues, but the central issue is the issue of peaceful coexistence that the Soviet delegation has formally submitted to the General Assembly. The world is divided into mutually opposed military blocs, the large-scale arms race launched by imperialism, and the increasing destructive power of new weapons. The people of the world are now eagerly demanding to be freed from the fear of atomic war. This makes the issue of peaceful coexistence more urgent than ever before.

The Soviet Union submitted to the General Assembly a draft declaration based on the famous five principles of peaceful coexistence, calling for the settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means. At the same time, the Soviet Union advocated that the United Nations completely solve the disarmament problem, and condemned the dangerous policies pursued by Western countries in the Middle East. In order to promote the solution of problems and improve the international situation, the Soviet Union proposed to expand the representation of the Disarmament Subcommittee, change the negotiation methods, and first reach an agreement on stopping the use of nuclear weapons for five years and stopping nuclear testing for three years; the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France guarantee not to use force in the Middle East and not to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries; convening a world economic conference with the participation of all relevant countries, and so on.

These proposals of the Soviet Union are in line with the wishes of the people of all countries in the world, but are obviously not liked by the United States and other imperialist countries. They will definitely use their majority in the United Nations to obstruct the General Assembly from adopting these extremely important proposals. Of course, the result of their doing so will inevitably further expose their true face of wanting war but not peaceful coexistence, thus encountering greater opposition from the people of the world and putting them in a more isolated position.

### 联合国大会开幕前后
顾思

    联合国大会开幕前后
    顾思
    第十二届联合国大会开幕了。这届大会是在怎样的国际形势下召开的呢？
    会前的形势
    自从世界和平和进步的力量在埃及和匈牙利两条战线上粉碎了帝国主义的进攻之后，一度紧张的国际局势，又逐步走向缓和。但是，帝国主义势力并不甘心于自己的失败。美国依恃它庞大的战争机器和对资本主义国家的控制，变本加厉地制造国际紧张局势，策动新的事件，以求达到它的反和平、反民族独立和反社会主义的目的。它在这方面的两个主要活动，就是：在中东加紧推行艾森豪威尔主义，伙同英、法、加等国破坏联合国裁军小组委员会的工作。美国利用它在中东煽动起来的紧张空气和它制造裁军谈判的困难，通过了和平时期空前庞大的军事预算，进一步推行组织军事性侵略集团的计划，并在世界各地区积极准备原子战争。同时，英国也在波斯湾地区发动了新的殖民侵略，并积极扩充核军备。法国也加紧了对阿尔及利亚人民的殖民战争。
    西方国家为了掩饰它们扩军备战和推行殖民主义的活动，无中生有地大事渲染所谓“匈牙利问题”，并强使联合国大会在第十二届大会开幕以前举行特别会议来进行讨论，同时大肆宣传所谓“共产主义对中东的渗入”，以便转移国际公众的视线。
    但是，帝国主义的反和平、反民族独立和反社会主义的活动，遇到了和平、民族独立和社会主义联合力量的反击。艾森豪威尔主义已在叙利亚和埃及遭到了严重的挫折，美国殖民主义的伪装撕破了。英、法进行殖民侵略的军事行动也陷入了困境，受到了国际公众舆论的广泛谴责。在裁军问题上，按照“纽约先驱论坛报”记者德拉蒙德承认的说法，西方国家蒙蔽舆论、推诿责任的努力，“肯定地是输了”。
    由于苏联已经成为世界上第一个掌握洲际弹道导弹的国家，使美国推行的原子讹诈政策彻底破产了，而全世界反对战争和帝国主义的力量却得到了巨大的鼓舞，更勇敢地和充满信心地在各个战线上给予帝国主义以坚决的打击。帝国主义内部的矛盾更尖锐起来了。美、英、法等帝国主义近来在中东北非地区的斗争和在军备政策上的分歧，就说明了这一点。
    两种力量的斗争
    以美国为首的帝国主义势力，把为它们的机械多数所操纵的联合国大会，看作是能够有助于挽回它们颓势的一个工具。它们希望利用联合国大会作为挡箭牌，来抵挡世界公众舆论对它们的责难，同时又把它作为一个矛头，把国际舆论的压力转过去对付苏联。杜勒斯在联合国大会上发表的开幕演说，就是为了达到这个目的。他的演说集中在裁军和中东局势两个问题上，因为正是在这两个关系到帝国主义根本利益的问题上，帝国主义现在的处境最为狼狈。
    目前，要求裁军特别是停止核试验和禁止原子武器的压力愈来愈大。如果裁军问题一旦达成协议，军备竞赛就要停止，国际局势就要大大缓和下来，这就将使美国无法继续推行它的侵略备战政策。同时，美国在中东推行艾森豪威尔主义的阻力也愈来愈大。如果这一侵略计划宣告破产，美国整个的战争政策就要遭受极其严重的打击。为了挽回这种局面，杜勒斯在演说中指黑为白，颠倒是非，力图把阻挠裁军和制造中东动乱的一切责任完全推到苏联头上，并且利用联合国这块牌子，掩护美国在中东进行更露骨的干涉，支持其阻挠裁军的立场。杜勒斯的这一领唱，得到了英、法及其他一班喽啰的应和。
    可以预见，在第十二届联合国大会上，和平和反殖民主义的力量同战争和帝国主义的势力之间，将要围绕着这些重大问题，展开一场针锋相对的、极其尖锐的斗争。
    形势对帝国主义不利
    帝国主义虽然操纵了大会的多数，但是斗争的形势对帝国主义是很不利的。
    在裁军问题上，西方国家虽然尽了一切努力，装出了各种愿意达成协议的姿态，并且还提出一套所谓“联合建议”，但是结果并没有达到蒙蔽舆论的目的。关于这一点，上面提到的“纽约先驱论坛报”记者也不得不承认说：“西方的裁军做法不为人们所理解，并且肯定地不为世界上一般国家所接受。它在西欧这里肯定并没有获得成功，并且我也怀疑它是否已经给了美国人民一个清楚的印象。”这位记者的意见反映出西方国家的窘境，在苏联提出的简单明了的裁军建议面前，要为西方找到动听的借口来摆脱世界舆论的压力，是很不容易了。
    至于中东问题，殖民帝国主义在这方面已经凶相毕露。艾森豪威尔主义的穷凶极恶，较英、法帝国主义有过之而无不及。但是叙利亚和埃及的人民是坚定的，阿拉伯各国人民是紧密团结的，而他们的反帝斗争又得到了爱好和平和尊重民族独立的各国人民、特别是强大的社会主义国家的有力支持。这种形势，使得帝国主义在进行直接的武装干涉之前，不得不加以三思。分化和颠覆的活动也更加困难了。对于这种形势，联合国的多数表决机器同样是无能为力的。
    正是因为它们在道义上站不住脚，帝国主义集团才有意蔑视匈牙利的主权，硬把莫须有的“匈牙利问题”列入大会的议程。它们想求助于这种卑劣的勾当，来转移大会的注意力，影响大会的讨论，阻止大会来处理像裁军和帝国主义在中东的侵略和干涉这样重要和迫切的问题。
    中心问题是和平共处
    在第十二届联合国大会的议程上，摆着几十个大大小小的问题，但是中心的问题是苏联代表团已经向大会正式提出的和平共处问题。世界分成相互对立的军事集团，帝国主义发动的大规模军备竞赛，新武器的愈来愈大的毁灭力，全世界的人民现在都急切地要求免除原子战争的恐惧。这使得和平共处的问题具有了前所未有的迫切性。
    苏联向大会提出了以有名的和平共处五项原则为基础的宣言草案，号召以和平方法解决一切国际争端。苏联同时主张联合国彻底解决裁军问题，谴责西方国家在中东推行的危险的政策。为了促进问题的解决，改善国际局势，苏联建议扩大裁军小组委员会的代表性，改变谈判方法，首先就停止使用核武器五年和停止核试验三年达成协议；由苏、美、英、法四国保证不在中东使用武力和不干涉中东国家的内政；召开有一切有关国家参加的世界经济会议等等。
    苏联的这些建议符合于世界各国人民的愿望，但是显然不为美国和其他帝国主义国家所喜欢。它们一定会利用他们在联合国中的多数，阻挠大会采纳这些极其重要的建议。当然，它们这样做的结果，必将更加暴露它们要战争而不要和平共处的真面目，因而将遭到全世界人民更大的反对，使它们陷于更加孤立的地位。
