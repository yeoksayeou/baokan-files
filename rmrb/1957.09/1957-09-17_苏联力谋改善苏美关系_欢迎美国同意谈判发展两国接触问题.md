Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: TASS reported from Moscow on September 15th: The Soviet Embassy in the United States submitted a memorandum to the U.S. State Department on the 12th regarding the development of Soviet-American contacts and relations.

The memorandum stated: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs "is pleased to learn that the U.S. State Department has accepted the proposal to hold negotiations between the Soviet and American governments on the development of Soviet-American contacts and relations. The Ministry of Foreign affairs agrees to begin negotiations in October 1957 between representatives of the U.S. State Department and the Soviet Ambassador in Washington."

The memorandum pointed out that the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot agree with the assertion that the American side has not created artificial obstacles to the development of Soviet-American contacts. The Soviet Embassy's memorandum of July 26th cited facts proving that Soviet-American contacts have not been able to develop as they should precisely because of the obstacles and restrictions created by the American side.

The Soviet Embassy memorandum then listed some issues that it hopes to discuss during the negotiations. These are issues involving economics, trade, science, culture, technology, and other aspects.

The memorandum stated, "The good experience of the Soviet Union in developing contacts with other countries, especially with some Western European countries, proves that much can be done in the above-mentioned areas and that many results beneficial to both sides can be obtained." The Soviet Union's starting point is that expanding Soviet-American contacts and relations in these areas will help create an atmosphere of trust in the relations between the two countries, will strengthen the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of the two countries, and will help improve Soviet-American relations.

The memorandum expressed the hope that the State Department would study the proposals of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in good faith.

This memorandum is a response to the U.S. State Department's memorandum of August 16th of this year. Today, all Moscow newspapers published the full text of these two memorandums.

　　苏联力谋改善苏美关系
　　欢迎美国同意谈判发展两国接触问题
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联驻美国大使馆12日把一份关于发展苏美接触和联系问题的备忘录交给美国国务院。
    备忘录中说：苏联外交部“欣然得悉美国国务院接受了关于苏美两国政府就发展苏美接触和联系问题举行谈判的建议。外交部同意在1957年10月开始由美国国务院代表同苏联驻华盛顿大使进行谈判”。
    备忘录指出，苏联外交部不能同意这样一种说法：似乎美国方面没有给发展苏美的接触制造人为障碍。苏联大使馆在7月26日的备忘录中曾经列举事实，证明正是由于美国方面制造的障碍和限制，苏联同美国的接触没能得到应有的发展。
    苏联大使馆备忘录接着列举了一些希望在谈判时加以讨论的问题。这是一些涉及经济、贸易、科学、文化、技术等各个方面的问题。
    备忘录说，“苏联同其他国家，特别是同西欧的某些国家发展接触的良好经验证明，在上述各个方面可以做许多工作，并且能够获得许多对双方有益的结果”。苏联的出发点是，扩大苏美在这些方面的接触和联系有助于在两国的关系上造成信任的气氛，将会加强两国人民的友谊和互相谅解，有助于改善苏美两国的关系。
    备忘录中表示，希望国务院能够善意地研究苏联外交部的建议。
    这份备忘录是答复美国国务院今年8月16日的备忘录的。今天，莫斯科各报都刊载了这两份备忘录的全文。
