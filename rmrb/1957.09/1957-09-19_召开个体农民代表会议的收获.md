The following is a translation of the body of the article:

In Baoying County, Jiangsu Province, there are currently 1,238 individual farming households, accounting for 0.7% of the total number of farming households. Since collectivization, political and ideological education for them has been relaxed. In some areas, apart from meetings for grain requisition, no other meetings have been held for them. Some grassroots cadres and agricultural cooperatives did not proceed from the standpoint of unity, educating and striving to bring them into the cooperatives. Instead, they adopted an attitude of exclusion and suppression, placing undue restrictions on them in production and discriminating against them politically. Due to these shortcomings, coupled with the capitalist thinking of many individual farmers, unnecessary divisions arose between individual farmers and grassroots cadres, agricultural cooperatives, and the state. Many individual farmers, especially the wealthier middle peasants among them, were unwilling to hand over public grain or sell surplus grain. Some even "put on a show" against the agricultural cooperatives, attempting to win over some wavering members to leave the cooperative. Some individual farmers deliberately flaunted their pork and white rice to the cooperative members. In Zhangqiao and Zuobao townships in Jinghe district, wealthier middle peasants outside the cooperatives brought wheat pancakes to the fields and distributed them to cooperative members, sarcastically saying, "Have you tasted wheat pancakes this year? We've already had several meals!" Some cooperative members were enticed and misled by individual farmers, also believing that "joining the cooperative is not free" and that "going it alone is better."

In order to consolidate and expand the socialist阵地 (陣地 - position/front) in the countryside, the Baoying County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a representative meeting of individual farmers on July 27th, with 274 individual farmers participating.

The individual farmers who attended the meeting had their own ideas and plans. Some were unsure and feared being "dealt with"; some had been angered by cadres and wanted to come up to reason with them and vent their anger; some had not been to a meeting in the village for a long time and came with the idea of "listening to reason"; some estimated that the meeting was nothing more than a discussion of joining the cooperative. Regarding the issue of joining the cooperative, they also held several different attitudes. Some believed that going it alone would not last long and planned to join the cooperative after autumn; some wanted to see how things developed, holding a wait-and-see attitude of "I'll do my hair the way others do"; some wanted to wait a few more years until the cooperatives were better run before joining; and some were determined not to join the cooperative. After education, the thinking of most people became clearer. On the grain issue, after education, those who actively supported the state's grain policy, fully reported yields, handed over public grain, and sold surplus grain accounted for 92.3% of the representatives, those who were still hesitant accounted for 4.1%, and those whose thinking was not clear accounted for 3.6%. On the issue of collectivization, 88.4% expressed their firm intention to join the cooperative, 2.6% were hesitant, and 9% had unclear thinking. Those with unclear thinking were mostly wealthier middle peasants and farmers who had been angered by cadres.

In order to make this meeting a success, the thinking of the leading cadres of the meeting (county and township staff and cooperative cadres) was first unified. It was made clear that the problems of individual farmers belonged to the category of internal contradictions among the people, and that individual farmers should be treated warmly, and they should be educated with the spirit of tireless persuasion. At this meeting, the class line of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants and uniting and educating upper-middle peasants was implemented from beginning to end. On the basis of uniting the majority, the erroneous thoughts and words of a minority were criticized. This is also the method of the mass line. The meeting process was divided into three steps.

One: Conduct Class Education to Encourage the Masses to Open Their Hearts

At the beginning of the meeting, the responsible comrade of the county committee gave a mobilization report, explaining the purpose of running cooperatives and implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain. He reviewed the shortcomings in past work, which was the failure to adequately publicize the policies of the Party and the state and insufficient unity and education for individual farmers. He called on individual farmers to unite with the broad masses of cooperative members, oppose capitalist exploitation, and take the road to common prosperity.

After listening to the report, in the discussion, many people overcame their worries and spoke their minds. According to the representatives' reflections, the reasons why they did not join the cooperative, apart from a few who were determined to take the capitalist road, were generally of three types: One type was wanting to join the cooperative but being unable to. During the high tide of collectivization, some poor peasants requested to join the cooperative, but the cadres believed that their "land was ugly, their farm tools were poor, and their labor was not good," and did not allow them to join the cooperative. Some people's wives had bad mouths and liked to scold people, and the masses were unwilling to have them join the cooperative. In Xu Village and Shaoxing Village in Zhangqiao Township, Jinghe District, ninety households gathered seeds in the high tide of collectivization, preparing to establish a cooperative. They waited until the time of transplanting seedlings, but the cadres were still unwilling to help them establish a cooperative and mobilized them to distribute the seeds. Another type of person was waiting to join the cooperative later. Waiting for what? Those without labor were waiting for their sons to grow up, those with debts were waiting to pay off their debts, military dependents were waiting for their sons to return, some were waiting for the cooperative's production to improve, and the elderly were waiting to earn a "coffin fund." A small number of people who had been suppressed by cadres were waiting for the cadres to be replaced. Still another type of person was afraid that they would not be able to keep up with others in labor after joining the cooperative, that their income would decrease, that they would not get along with the cadres, that they would suffer losses, that they would be ridiculed, that they would not be free, and so on.

At this time, core members had individual talks with many representatives, uniting a group of activists, and then the activists influenced and educated the middle elements. In this stage, the thinking of 195 people was clarified, accounting for 71%, most of whom were poor and lower-middle peasants.

There were two types of people whose thinking was not clear. One type of person had been beaten and scolded by cadres and harbored resentment and a lot of anger. They said, "Going it alone is like being bullied like a young daughter-in-law," with no share in relief or loans, and unable to get bran or oil certificates, just as the saying goes, "If the pot is not hot, the pancake won't stick." Another small number of people were concealing their acreage, underreporting their yields, and unwilling to hand over public grain or sell surplus grain, believing that going it alone was free, "officials don't care and people don't bother." Both of these types of people said that the leadership of the Communist Party had not brought them any benefits.

Two: Present Ideological Problems and Hold Heated Debates

In response to the ideological problems of these last two types of people, the leadership made a supplementary report, patiently explaining to them the Communist Party's policy towards cadres, that problems should be put on the table and treated as family matters, that the line between the enemy and ourselves should be clearly distinguished, that they should not be fooled by the enemy, and that they should help the cadres do their work well as masters, strengthen unity, and take the socialist road together.

Then, debates were conducted in groups on the following aspects:

1.  Comparing the Old and the New, Which is Better and Which is Worse?

Everyone recalled their personal experiences and unanimously agreed that the new society was not only good, but much better. In the old society, there were many exorbitant taxes and levies, landlords ruthlessly forced rent, usurious loans rolled in profits fiercely, and coupled with the Kuomintang's extortion, and fluctuating prices, these were like rocks piled one on top of another, suffocating the peasants. The Communist Party led the peasants on the road to brightness and happiness. When peasants had difficulties, they were given loans and relief, and they were constantly assisted in production in various ways. To say that things are not good is simply ungrateful. Lin Chengyin from Jingou District said: "In the 1938 flood, five members of my family were washed away, and not even a chopstick was left. Last year, there was a big flood, and with the help of the government, I still harvested ninety dan of wheat… Comparing the two, it’s like night and day.” The wife of Lu Guangui, who used to not believe in the Communist Party, also praised in her speech that the present society is a peaceful world, and one can sleep soundly. The living facts powerfully refuted the claim of a few people that the leadership of the Communist Party had not brought them much benefit. Someone admitted that they had misspoke and said, "Although I said that, I still support the Communist Party in my heart."

2.  Are Cooperatives Really Good?

When the discussion of this issue began, some people listed certain shortcomings of the cooperatives in production, such as the wheat not being harvested cleanly, the seedlings being transplanted late and not growing as well as those of individual farmers, the farm tools not being taken care of, and the cattle being thin, etc. However, when it came to yield, they said that their yield was not as high as that of the cooperatives. This was an attempt to find reasons for handing over less public grain and selling less surplus grain, not a sincere admission that the cooperatives were good. After the great achievements of the cooperatives in overcoming natural disasters, rational fertilization, soil improvement, and water conservancy construction were presented, as well as the facts of increased production after various lands were brought into the cooperatives, they finally conceded. Shen Tingguan, a poor peasant from Zhanglou Township, Wangzhi District, said: "Needless to say, going it alone has no power to resist natural disasters, even my family of three is too busy to cultivate six mu and four fen of land. I have no cattle or farm tools for production, I have to beg my older brother and older sister, and worry and toil, making production difficult. I will join the cooperative when I go back this time."

3.  Is the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain Really Good?

No one denied the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain. However, some people said: "The ration is just too little, and 460 jin is not enough to eat." After recalling and comparing, everyone's opinions were unified. Liu Maiyuan from Xiaji District said: "Which poor peasant used to eat 460 jin? Cultivating the landlord's land, once the rent was paid, all that was left was a body covered in mud. Every year after autumn, I had to flee famine and beg for food. I didn't wear pants until I was fourteen years old. Now I don't have to worry about clothes or food. To say that life is not good now is truly ungrateful!"

4.  If Cadres Have Shortcomings, Should We Adopt an Attitude of Helping, or a Method of Killing Them with One Blow?

The people who attended the meeting were extremely dissatisfied with the bad work style of a few grassroots cadres. Therefore, there was some "head-butting" at the beginning of the discussion, but in the end, a correct understanding was reached. Some said that grassroots cadres are all children of poor and middle peasants, born from the soil, and most of them want to do their work well. The main problem is that their work methods are not good, and a few people have some selfish and self-interested shortcomings, which can be corrected. We cannot say that just because one person's mouth is crooked, everyone should shout that their mouths are crooked. Some things cannot be blamed on the cadres alone. Wang Liangshan from Lvliang District said: "Don't blame others if your own thinking is not clear. For example, if the cadres implement unified purchase and sale, and we want to buy and sell privately, then that is our fault." Dai Shifeng from Shanyang District said: "To tell the truth, the cadres' tempers have changed a lot now. Last year, the cooperative director Bian Danyu always yelled at us, but now he is caring and kind to us. This spring, the several mu of wheat in my family did not grow well, and I was preparing to plow it up. The cooperative director kindly dissuaded me, and I listened to him, and in the end, I harvested 130 jin per mu." He also said: "As long as there is the Communist Party to educate them, the cadres will all change for the better." Some people then said: "We cannot just want the cadres to change, we must also change." In the end, the unanimous opinion of many people was: "Our quarrels with the cadres are family matters. A family cannot speak two different languages. Once we've argued, it's over. We guarantee to join the cooperative!"

Speeches at the meeting were very enthusiastic. Through discussion, people distinguished between right and wrong. Of the 145 people who attended from Jinghe District, 90% expressed their determination to join the cooperative after autumn. Although a small number of people still had temporary doubts about joining the cooperative, they also recognized that the general trend of taking the socialist road was certain.

Three: Organize a General Meeting for Speeches and Exchange Guarantees

On the basis of the majority of people's thinking being clarified, a general meeting for speeches was organized. At the same time, cadres from six townships and cooperatives made self-criticisms at the meeting. For example, those who had cut individual households' wheat expressed that they would compensate them, those who had beaten and scolded people apologized to everyone, things that should be supplied (bran, oil, etc.) would be supplied according to the regulations in the future, and households that should be given relief would be given relief, guaranteeing that individual farmers and cooperative members would be treated equally. The representatives who attended the meeting were in a happy mood, and the majority of them expressed their firm determination to follow the Communist Party and take the socialist road. He Jiabao from Jinghe District guaranteed at the meeting that, in addition to mobilizing his entire family to join the cooperative, he would also mobilize the individual farmers around him to join the cooperative. Shen Zhangshi, a family member of a revolutionary martyr from Lvliang Township, said at the meeting that her eldest son had gloriously sacrificed himself for the revolution, and that her family had a blood relationship with the Communist Party, and should not fail to join the cooperative. She would not only join the cooperative herself when she returned, but also mobilize others to join the cooperative.

This meeting also educated the cadres who attended: Problems among the people can be solved by means of persuasion and education; listen patiently to both positive and negative opinions, then distinguish between right and wrong, sincerely accept reasonable opinions, and immediately take action to implement those that can be fulfilled; and criticize erroneous opinions on the basis of raising the consciousness of the majority, otherwise you will not gain the approval of the majority. The criticism of the erroneous thoughts and words of wealthier middle peasants is also for the purpose of achieving unity. Clarifying this point is of great help in overcoming the impatient emotions of a small number of comrades.

　　召开个体农民代表会议的收获
　　中共江苏省宝应县委员会
    江苏省宝应县现有个体农民一千二百三十八户，占总农户的0.7％。合作化以后，放松了对他们的政治思想教育，有的地区除了征粮的会之外，没有找他们开过别的会。有些基层干部和农业合作社对于个体农民不是从团结出发，教育、争取他们入社，而是采取了排斥、打击的态度，在生产上对他们作了不应有的限制，在政治上歧视他们。由于这些缺点，再加上许多个体农民有资本主义思想，因而在个体农民同基层干部、农业社、国家之间产生了不应有的隔阂，不少个体农民，特别是他们中间的富裕中农公粮不肯交，余粮不肯卖，甚至同农业社“摆阵势”，企图拉拢一些思想不坚定的社员出社。有些个体农民故意把猪肉、白米饭捧出来吃给社员看。泾河区张桥、左堡等乡的社外富裕中农把麦糊饼带到田散给社员吃，并且讽刺地说：“你们今年可曾尝到过麦糊饼啊？我们已经吃过好几顿啦！”有些社员受到了个体农民的引诱和迷惑，也认为“入社不自由”，“不如单干好”。
    为了巩固和扩大农村的社会主义阵地，中共宝应县委曾经在7月27日召开了一次个体农民代表会议，参加这次会议的有个体农民二百七十四人。
    到会的个体农民各有各的想法和打算。有的不登底，怕“被处理”；有的是在下面受过干部的气，这回要上来讲理、出口气；有的在村里已经长时期没开过会，这回抱着“听听道理”的想法来了；有的估计这次开会，无非是谈入社问题的。对于入社问题，他们也抱有几种不同的态度。有的认为单干时间不会长了，打算秋后入社；有的要看大势，抱着“人家怎样梳头，我就怎样打扮”的观望态度；有的想再等几年，社办好了再入社；也有的人坚决不想入社。经过教育，大多数人思想通了。在粮食问题上，经过教育，积极拥护国家的粮食政策、报足产量、照缴公粮和照卖余粮的占代表的92.3％，还在豫犹的占4.1％，思想不通的占3.6％。在合作化的问题上，表示坚决入社的占88.4％，犹豫的占2.6％，思想不通的占9％。思想不通的大都是富裕中农和受过干部的气的农民。
    为了开好这次会议，首先统一了会议的领导骨干（县乡工作人员和社干部）的思想，明确指出个体农民的问题属于人民内部矛盾，应该热心对待单干农民，并用百说不厌的精神去教育他们。在这次会议上，自始至终执行了依靠贫农和下中农、团结教育上中农的阶级路线，在团结多数的基础上批判少数人的错误思想和言论，这也就是群众路线的方法。会议进程共分三步。
    一　进行阶级教育启发群众谈心
    会议开始，首先由县委负责同志作了动员报告，说明办合作社和实行粮食统购统销的目的。向大家检讨了过去工作中的缺点是没有很好地宣传党和国家的政策，对个体农民团结教育不够。要求个体农民同广大社员团结起来，反对资本主义剥削，走共同富裕的道路。
    听过报告之后，在讨论中，不少人打破顾虑，说出了内心话。根据代表们的反映，他们没有入社的原因，除少数人是坚决想走资本主义道路外，一般的有三种情况：一种是望入社不得入。在合作化高潮中，有些贫农要求入社，干部却认为他们的“土地丑、农具差、劳力不行”，不让他们进社。有的人老婆嘴不好，好骂人，群众不肯要他们入社。泾河区张桥乡的徐庄、邵兴庄等村有九十户在合作化高潮中，集中了种子，准备办社，一直等到下秧的时节，干部还不肯帮助他们建社，动员他们把种子分掉了。又一种人是等等再入社。等甚么？无劳力的等儿子长大，有债的等还清债，军属等儿子回来，有的等社里生产搞好，老年人等赚个“棺材本”，少数受过干部打击的人等干部换掉。再一种人是怕入社以后劳动比不过人，收入减少，怕跟干部合不来，怕吃亏，怕受讽刺，怕不自由，等等。
    这时，骨干分子同许多代表个别谈心，团结了一批积极分子，然后再由积极分子去影响、教育中间分子。在这一阶段，思想搞通的有一百九十五人，占71％，其中大部分是贫农和下中农。
    思想没通的有两种人。一种人是受干部打过、骂过的，心怀不满、怨气很大。他们说：“单干像小媳妇一样受欺凌”，救济、贷款没有份，猪糠、油证领不到，正像俗话所说的：“锅不热，饼不靠”。另有少数人是瞒报田亩，少报产量，不肯交公粮卖余粮，认为单干自由，“官不睬民不扰”。这两种人都说共产党的领导没有给他们带来好处。
    二　摆出思想问题大家热烈辩论
    针对最后这两种人的思想问题，领导方面又作了补充报告，耐心地向他们说明共产党对待干部的政策，有问题要摆到桌面上当作家务事处理，分清敌我界限，不要上敌人的当，要他们以主人翁的身分，帮助干部做好工作，加强团结，共同走社会主义道路。
    接着在小组里就以下几方面进行辩论。
    1、新旧对比，谁好谁坏？
    大家回忆亲身经历的事情，一致公认新社会不仅是好，而且好得多。旧社会里苛捐杂税多，地主逼租狠，高利贷滚利凶，再加上反动派的敲诈勒索，物价波动，这些像一块接着一块的石头，把农民压得一点气都透不过来。共产党领导农民往光明幸福的路上走，农民有了困难就贷款、救济，不断地从各方面帮助农民生产，再说不好的话，除非没有良心。金沟区林成银说：“1938年的洪水，冲走了我家五口人，一根筷子都不存；去年发了大水，靠了政府的帮助，还收了九十担麦子。……两下一比，一天一地。”过去不相信共产党的鲁光奎的老婆，在发言中也赞美现在的社会是太平世界，睡觉也稳当。活生生的事实，有力地驳倒了少数人认为共产党的领导对他们没有多大好处的说法。有人承认话说错了，还说：嘴上虽然那样说，心里还是拥护共产党的。
    2、合作社到底好不好？
    开始讨论这个问题的时候，有些人列举了合作社生产上的某些缺点，如麦子没打干净，秧栽得迟了，长得不如个体农民的好，农具没人管，耕牛瘦等等，但是，谈到产量，他们却说他们的产量没有合作社的高。这是想为少交公粮、少卖余粮找理由，并不是真心承认合作社好。等到把合作社在战胜自然灾害、合理施肥、改良土壤、兴修水利方面的巨大成就和各种土地入社后增产的事实摆出来以后，他们才服输。望直区张楼乡贫农沈廷官说：“单干不用说没力量抵抗自然灾害，就连我家三口人种六亩四分田都忙不过来，生产上耕牛、农具俱无，求哥哥，拜姐姐，操心劳碌，生产难搞。这次回去就入社”。
    3、粮食统购统销究竟好不好？
    对于粮食统购统销的好处，是没有人否认的。但是有人说：“就是口粮少了，四百六十斤不够吃。”经过回忆、对比，大家的意见一致了。夏集区刘迈元说：“过去贫农哪个吃到四百六十斤啊？ 种地主田，租一交，只落一身泥灰，每年秋后逃荒要饭，我长到十四岁没穿过裤子。现在穿吃不愁，再说生活不好的话，真是忘本！”
    4、干部有缺点，应该采取帮助的态度，还是采用一棍子打死的办法？
    到会的人对少数基层干部的坏作风极为不满，因此，开始讨论时有些“顶牛”，但最后还是取得了正确的认识。有的说基层干部都是贫农、中农的子弟，泥腿子出身，多数是想做好工作的，主要是工作方法不好，少数人有些自私自利的缺点，这些是可以改正的，不能一个说嘴歪，个个都喊歪嘴。有的事也不能都怪干部错。吕良区王良山说：“自己思想不通，不要乱怪人，比如干部搞统购统销，我们要私买私卖，这就是我们的错处。”山阳区戴士凤说：“凭良心话，现在干部脾气改得多了，社长卞丹元去年对我们总是呼吆喝之，现在对我们又关心又和气。春天我家的几亩麦子长得不好，我准备耕耖，社长好心劝阻，我听了他的话，每亩终于收了一百三十斤。”又说：“只要有共产党教育，干部都会变好的。”有些人接着说：“不能只要干部变，我们也要变。”最后，许多人一致的意见是：“我们和干部吵嘴是家务问题，一家人不能说两家话，吵过就算了事，我们保证入社！”
    会上发言很踊跃。经过讨论，人们分清了大是大非。泾河区到会一百四十五人，有90％的人表示决心在秋后入社。虽然有少数人对入社问题暂时还想不通，但他们也认识到走社会主义道路的大势是肯定的了。
    三　组织大会发言互相提出保证
    在大部分人思想通了的基础上，组织了大会发言。同时有六个乡社干部在大会上做了检讨。如割单干户的麦子的表示要赔偿，打骂过人的向大家道歉，应当供应的东西（糠、油等）以后照供应，应当救济的户救济，保证对个体农民和社员一视同仁。到会代表心情愉快，大多数人表示坚决跟着共产党走社会主义道路。泾河区何家宝在大会上保证，除了动员全家入社外，还要动员周围的个体农民入社。吕良乡烈属沈张氏在大会上说，她的大儿子为革命光荣牺牲，她家和共产党有血肉关系，不该不入社。这次回去，除自己入社外，还要动员别人入社。
    这次会也教育了到会的干部：人民内部的问题可以用说服教育的方法解决；要耐心地倾听正面和反面的意见，然后分清是非，对合理的意见诚恳接受，能够兑现的立即着手办理；对错误的意见，要在多数人提高觉悟的基础上进行批判，否则得不到多数人的赞同。批判富裕中农的错误思想和言论，也是为了达到团结的目的。明确了这一点，对于克服少数同志的急躁情绪，有很大帮助。
