Xinhua News Agency, Jishou, 25th – The impoverished days of the people of all ethnic groups in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, who historically relied on "bran and wild herbs for half the year," are now gone forever. This year, the total grain output of the prefecture will increase by one time compared with the best year before liberation. Before liberation, there was a grain shortage every year, and grain needed to be transported from other places. This year, more than 100 million jin of surplus grain will be transported out to support the country's industrial construction.

Xiangxi is rich in water resources, but before liberation, paddy fields relied only on rainfall for irrigation, and there was no harvest in case of drought. Cultivation was also very extensive, with an average yield of only about 200 jin of grain per mu of paddy field. After liberation, thanks to the local Party and government leading organs guiding farmers of all ethnic groups to actively build small-scale water conservancy projects, the drought situation has been basically changed. The "slash-and-burn" cultivation method has also been rapidly changed. This year, more than 110,000 mu of double-cropping early rice, which was successfully trial-planted on a large scale, yielded an average of 387 jin of dry grain per mu. Intermediate rice also yielded 420 jin. Currently, late rice is growing vigorously, and a bumper harvest is in sight. According to surveys and estimates, this year the average grain consumption per person per year in the prefecture will reach more than 600 jin.

    糠菜半年粮”的日子一去不返
    一向缺粮的湘西山区今年可外运余粮
    新华社吉首25日电　湘西土家族苗族自治州各族人民历来“糠菜半年粮”的穷困日子，现在一去不复返了。今年全州粮食产量将比解放前最好年成增产一倍。解放前这里年年缺粮，需要从外地运进粮来；今年将有一亿多斤余粮运出，支援祖国工业建设。
    湘西水利资源丰富，但在解放前稻田只靠天雨灌溉，天一旱就没有收成。耕作也很粗放，每亩稻田平均只收谷二百斤左右。解放后，由于当地党政领导机关领导各族农民积极兴修小型水利，已经基本上改变了干旱面貌。“刀耕火种”的耕作方法也已迅速改变。今年大面积试种成功的十一万多亩双季稻早稻，平均每亩实收干谷三百八十七斤。中稻也收到四百二十斤。目前晚稻生长茁壮，丰收在望。据调查估计，今年全州平均每人每年用粮将达到六百多斤。
