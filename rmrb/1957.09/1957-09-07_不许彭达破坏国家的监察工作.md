    Peng Da Must Not Be Allowed to Sabotage National Supervisory Work
    Comrade Editor:
    I am an employee of the Lanzhou Materials Factory of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and also a part-time supervisory correspondent. When I read in the newspaper the absurd remarks of Peng Da, a class enemy who had infiltrated the Party, advocating the abolition of supervisory correspondents, saying that "people's letters are trivial and have no effect," and slandering comrades who handle people's letters as "creating waste paper," I felt very angry. Now I want to use the achievements of our supervisory correspondents to refute this right-wing element's unfounded lies.
    Since its establishment in January last year, the supervisory correspondents of our Lanzhou Materials Factory have assisted the supervisory department in reviewing the factory's procurement plan, stopping the purchase of more than 200 items of materials and reducing procurement funds by more than 430,000 yuan. After we reported to the supervisory department that there was a backlog of funds in the "inventory reserve quota" of the mechanical parts warehouse, it aroused the attention of the leadership, and the original mechanical parts procurement plan was overturned and recompiled, thereby reducing the "inventory reserve quota" by more than 600,000 yuan and accelerating the turnover of working capital. In addition, we also proposed the renovation and utilization of old and waste jacks, track flatcars, etc., and the suggestion of using bamboo instead of wood, saving the state more than 20,000 yuan of wealth and more than 300 square meters of wood.
    Facts have proved that the right-wing element Peng Da's advocacy of abolishing supervisory correspondents and neglecting people's letters is unfounded and is only to achieve his shameful goal of sabotaging the supervisory work of the Party and the state.　Wang Jingcheng

    不许彭达破坏国家的监察工作
    编辑同志：
    我是铁道部第一工程局兰州材料厂的职工，也是一个兼职监察通讯员。当我从报纸上看到混入党内的阶级异己分子——彭达，主张取消监察通讯员，说“人民来信是鸡毛蒜皮，不起作用”，诬蔑处理人民来信的同志是“制造废纸”等荒谬言论时，感到非常气愤。现在我要拿我们监察通讯员的工作成绩，来驳斥这个右派分子毫无根据的谎言。
    我们兰州材料厂的监察通讯员，从去年1月成立以后，曾经协助监察部门审查过厂里的采购计划，停购材料二百多项，压缩采购资金四十三万多元。当我们向监察部门反映了机械配件库“库存储备定额”有积压资金现象以后，引起领导的重视，将原来的机械配件采购计划推翻重编，因而降低了“库存储备定额”六十多万元，加速了流动资金的周转。另外我们还提出旧废千斤项、轨道平车等翻新利用和竹材代用木材的建议，给国家节约了二万多元的财富和三百多平方的木板。
    事实证明，右派分子彭达主张取消监察通讯员，轻视人民来信，是没有根据的，只不过是为了达到他破坏党和国家监察工作的可耻目的而已。　王镜澄
