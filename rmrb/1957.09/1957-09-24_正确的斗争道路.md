The Correct Path of Struggle
By Our Staff Commentator

The leaders of the Syrian state and government have recently made successive statements, powerfully refuting the absurd remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at the United Nations General Assembly that interfered in Syria's internal affairs and distorted the Syrian situation.

Syrian President Kuwatly on the 21st strongly criticized the Western countries' policy of "blockade measures, troop concentrations, and threats" against Syria. He condemned Dulles for "using the world forum to incite the world against our just cause with fabricated lies." Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali and Foreign Minister Bitar also criticized the United States' policy. Prime Minister al-Asali pointed out that Dulles's speech was "full of malice, threats, fabrications, and provocations towards Syria" and was the culmination of the anti-Syrian campaign by the United States.

While refuting Dulles, the leaders of the Syrian state and government resolutely stated that Syria is ready to repel any aggression by all means to defend its independence and freedom. They also called on the Arab people to strive for Arab unity in order to eliminate and weaken the imperialist forces in the Middle East. The Syrian government's firm patriotic stance is not only warmly supported by the Syrian people but also resolutely supported by peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world.

As Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali pointed out, the struggle of the Syrian people is not isolated. If imperialism fantasizes about conquering Syria, there are ways to make it "recover its senses." In this regard, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Gromyko, has once again issued a warning to the imperialists. In his speech on September 20, Gromyko powerfully condemned the United States for creating tension in the Near and Middle East when he talked about the situation in the Near and Middle East. He pointed out that the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the aggravation of the tense situation in the Middle East because it endangers the security of the Soviet Union itself. Gromyko reiterated the proposal that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should guarantee not to use force in the Middle East and not to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries in this region, and demanded that the United Nations General Assembly support these principles to improve the situation in the Middle East.

Gromyko's speech fully reflects the completely different attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States towards the Middle East situation. The Soviet Union shows that it fully understands and fully supports the national aspirations of the Arab people, while the United States is doing its best to distort and slander the legitimate demands of the Arab people in order to achieve its own aggressive aims. The Soviet Union demands that the United Nations play its due role in maintaining peace in the Middle East and the independence of the countries in the Middle East, while the United States attempts to use the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries in the Middle East and undermine peace in the region. Facts have once again proved that the Soviet Union is the most reliable friend of the people of the Middle East. We, the Chinese people, fully support the Soviet Union's just stand.

The Syrian government and people's heroic struggle against the US imperialist aggression plot, and the broad support this struggle has received, have boosted the confidence of the Arab people in the anti-imperialist struggle, thus thwarting the US plot to undermine the unity of Arab countries. Recently, many Arab countries have expressed their support for Syria's resistance to aggression, which has placed those who attempt to carry out the dirty task of aggression against Syria for the United States in an extremely isolated position. It is particularly noteworthy that Saudi Arabian King Saud is scheduled to visit Syria on the 28th of this month. According to the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Egypt, Saud's visit is to express that the Saudi Arabian government, military, and civilians will support Syria in any situation. Given the important position of Saudi Arabia in the Arab countries, the strengthening of its unity with Syria and Egypt will be a powerful blow to the imperialist plot to divide the Arab countries and will greatly benefit the victory of Arab nationalism.

In the process of opposing the US imperialist aggression plot, the Syrian people have strengthened internal unity and at the same time strengthened unity with other Arab people and peace-loving people of the world. This is the correct path of struggle. Relying on this broad and strong unity, the Syrian people will surely achieve a great victory against US aggression.

    正确的斗争道路
    本报评论员
    叙利亚国家和政府的领导人最近接连发表谈话，有力地驳斥了美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上干涉叙利亚内政、歪曲叙利亚局势的荒谬言论。
    叙利亚总统库阿特利在21日强烈抨击西方国家对叙利亚所采取的“封锁措施、军队集结和威胁”的政策。他谴责杜勒斯“利用世界讲坛用捏造的谎言来激起世界来反对我们的正义事业”。叙利亚总理阿萨利和外交部长比塔尔也指责了美国的政策。阿萨利总理指出，杜勒斯的演说“对叙利亚充满了恶意、威胁、捏造和挑衅”，是美国反叙利亚运动的顶点。
    叙利亚国家和政府领导人在驳斥杜勒斯的同时，坚决地表示叙利亚准备好了用一切办法击退任何侵略，以保卫自己的独立和自由。他们也号召阿拉伯人民为阿拉伯团结而努力，以便扫除和削弱帝国主义在中东的势力。叙利亚政府所采取的这种坚定的爱国主义的立场，不但受到叙利亚人民的热烈拥护，而且也受到全世界爱好和平、主张正义的人民的坚决支持。
    正如叙利亚总理阿萨利所指出的，叙利亚人民的斗争不是孤立的。如果帝国主义妄想征服叙利亚，就有办法使它“恢复理智”。在这一方面，苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长葛罗米柯，已经又一次向帝国主义者们提出了警告。葛罗米柯在他9月20日发表的演说中谈到中近东局势的时候，有力地谴责美国在中近东制造紧张局势。他指出，苏联对于中东地区紧张局势的加剧不能漠不关心，因为这危及到苏联本身的安全。葛罗米柯再次建议由美、英、法、苏四国保证不在中东使用武力和不干涉这个地区国家的内政，并且要求联合国大会支持这些原则，以改善中东的局势。
    葛罗米柯的演说，充分反映了苏联和美国对于中东局势所采取的完全不同的态度。苏联表明它是充分了解并且完全支持阿拉伯人民的民族愿望的，而美国却为了达到自己的侵略目的而竭力歪曲和诬蔑阿拉伯人民的正当要求。苏联要求联合国发挥它应有的作用，来维护中东地区的和平和中东各国的独立，而美国却企图利用联合国来干涉中东各国的内政，破坏这个地区的和平。事实又一次证明了苏联是中东人民最可信赖的朋友。我们中国人民完全支持苏联这种正义的立场。
    叙利亚政府和人民反对美国侵略的英勇斗争和这个斗争所得到的广泛支持，鼓舞了阿拉伯人民反帝国主义斗争的信心，因而挫败了美国破坏阿拉伯各国团结的阴谋。最近许多阿拉伯国家都先后表示将支持叙利亚抵抗侵略，这就使得那些企图替美国执行侵略叙利亚的肮脏任务的人处于极为孤立的地位。特别值得注意的是沙特阿拉伯国王沙特定于本月28日访问叙利亚。据沙特阿拉伯驻埃及大使说，沙特的访问是表示沙特阿拉伯政府和军民在任何情况下都将支持叙利亚。鉴于沙特阿拉伯在阿拉伯国家中所居的重要地位，它同叙利亚、埃及的团结的加强，将给帝国主义分化阿拉伯国家的阴谋以有力的打击，而大大有利于阿拉伯民族主义的胜利。
    叙利亚人民在反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋的过程中，加强了内部的团结，同时也加强了同其他阿拉伯人民和世界爱好和平的人民的团结。这是一条正确的斗争道路。依靠着这种广泛而坚强的团结，叙利亚人民必将取得反对美国侵略的伟大胜利。
