    Zhangzhou Elderly Organize Folk Art

    In Zhangzhou City, more than twenty elderly people are diligently organizing Zhangzhou folk tales, fables, and Jin songs that they can still remember. Lin Ting, a 78-year-old artist, has been studying Jin songs for 59 years. He has now compiled more than 20 Jin songs, including the long-circulated myth "Rebellion Under the Sea" which opposes feudal tyranny, the "Lazy Man's Song" which satirizes idlers who dislike labor, and folk tales such as "The Case of the Zhangzhou Teaching Son Bridge" and "The Axe Story." He is also adapting Jin songs about the Red Army entering Zhangzhou, which he composed more than twenty years ago and were popular in southern Fujian. Yang Xun, a 71-year-old man, has compiled stories of peasant uprisings such as "The Double Knife Society's Huang Demei," "Chen Guibi," and "Jian Dashi," and has re-proofread and reorganized "A Study of Zhangzhou's New and Old Bridges," "The Changes of the Jiangdong Bridge," and "Talks on Zhangzhou Porcelain Kilns" and other scenic spot historical researches. Chen Jiarui, a 61-year-old man, has also compiled "The Story of Cai Mei" and "From the Exhibition of Zhangzhou Famous Brand Commodities to Zhangzhou's Mountain Delicacies and Seafood," etc. Wu Jiaduan, a 60-year-old man, has compiled fables such as "The Origin of the Ancient Bell and Stone Buddha of Nanshan Temple" and "The Bell Thief Who Covered His Ears."

    漳州老人整理民间文艺
    漳州市有二十余位老年人正在孜孜不倦地整理他们尚能记忆的漳州民间故事、寓言和锦歌。七十八岁老艺人林廷，研究锦歌有五十九年的历史，现在他已整理出锦歌二十余首。其中有流传已久、反对封建暴政的神话“海底反”，讽刺二流子不爱劳动的“懒汉歌”，民间传说“漳州教子桥案”、“斧头记”等；他还在改编二十余年前创作的流行在闽南一带的红军入漳的锦歌。七十一岁老人杨巽从已经整理出了“双刀会黄德美”、“陈圭壁”、“简大狮”等农民起义故事，并重新校对、整理了“漳州新旧桥考”、“江东桥之变迁”、“漳州瓷窑谈”等名胜古迹考。六十一岁老人陈家瑞也已整理出了“蔡美故事”和“由漳州名牌商品展览说到漳产的山珍海味”等。六十岁老人吴家端已经整理出“南山寺古钟和石佛来历”、“掩耳盗铃”等寓言。
