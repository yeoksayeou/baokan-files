Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Criminal Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court decided on the 3rd to revoke the erroneous judgment of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court to grant counter-revolutionary Han Guoping educational release, and announced that the original verdict of the Longguan County People's Court of Hebei Province on Han Guoping would be upheld, namely, sentencing Han Guoping to eight years of imprisonment and depriving him of political rights for three years. This judgment has already been executed on the 7th.

The case of counter-revolutionary Han Guoping was used by rightist Huang Shaohong to attack the people's judicial organs. He said in his speech at the Third Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that without the "serious supervision" of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court, the counter-revolutionary Han Guoping would have been "wrongfully drowned."

According to the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate, in 1946, counter-revolutionary Han Guoping served as the Kuomintang District Branch Secretary at the Taiyuan Industrial School, and later as the District Party Secretary. During this period, he developed Kuomintang members in the school and led the Kuomintang members in the school to form a propaganda team, which carried out anti-communist propaganda in public places and wantonly slandered the Communist Party. When Han Guoping studied at Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing in 1947, he colluded with secret agents in the school to sabotage student movements and monitor progressive students, and with two other counter-revolutionaries, he searched the home of progressive student Yang Guanglie. Under Han's persecution, some of the progressive students in the school had to leave Beijing one after another. After liberation, Han Guoping concealed his main counter-revolutionary identity and crimes, and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. He tried in every possible way to obstruct students and teachers of adult night schools in the streets from joining the People's Liberation Army and the New Democratic Youth League, and openly slandered the people's leaders. After the start of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, he took the opportunity to provoke farmers. In August 1955, when he was a teacher at the Longguan County Cadre Spare-time School in Hebei Province, he was arrested for the above-mentioned counter-revolutionary crimes. After Han Guoping was arrested, he admitted his main counter-revolutionary facts when the evidence was irrefutable. In November 1956, the Longguan County People's Court sentenced Han Guoping to eight years of imprisonment and deprived him of political rights for three years based on the above circumstances. In February 1957, the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court erroneously revoked the above judgment and changed the sentence of Han Guoping to educational release.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate, based on the inspection of the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate, filed a protest to the Supreme People's Court in accordance with the law. The Supreme People's Court, based on the protest of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, reviewed the case and held that the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court did not seriously analyze and investigate the historical counter-revolutionary issues confessed by the counter-revolutionary Han Guoping and his counter-revolutionary rumors and sabotage activities after liberation, and determined that Han Guoping's historical counter-revolutionary issues "had been largely confessed," and said that Han Guoping's continued counter-revolutionary activities after liberation were "backward and reactionary words and deeds," which was obviously wrong.

　　黄绍竑向司法机关进攻的又一阴谋破产了
　　韩国屏是一贯破坏革命的罪犯
　　最高人民法院决定维持龙关县原判，撤销河北高级法院的改判
    据新华社11日讯  最高人民法院刑事审判庭3日决定撤销河北省高级人民法院对反革命分子韩国屏判处教育释放的错误判决，宣布维持河北省龙关县人民法院对韩国屏的原判，即判处韩国屏有期徒刑八年，剥夺政治权利三年。这一判决已经在7日执行。
    反革命分子韩国屏一案曾被右派分子黄绍竑利用来向人民司法机关进攻。他在政协全国委员会第三次全体会议上发言说，如没有河北省高级人民法院的“认真监督”，反革命分子韩国屏就将“冤沉海底”。
    据河北省人民检察院检查，反革命分子韩国屏1946年在太原市工业学校担任国民党区分部书记，后来又担任区党部书记。在此期间，他曾在这个学校里发展国民党员，并领导学校里的国民党员组成宣传队，在公共场所进行反共宣传，大肆污蔑共产党。1947年韩国屏在北京辅仁大学读书时，先后同学校中的特务分子勾结起来，破坏学生运动和监视进步学生，并和另外两名反革命分子到进步学生杨光烈家中大肆搜查。这个学校的一部分进步学生在韩的迫害下不得不先后离开北京。解放以后，韩国屏隐瞒了主要反革命身份和罪行，继续进行反革命活动，曾多方阻挠街道成人夜校的学员、教师参加人民解放军和新民主主义青年团，并且公开诽谤人民领袖。抗美援朝开始后，他又乘机在农民群众中进行挑拨。1955年8月他在河北省龙关县干部业余学校任教员时，因上述反革命罪被逮捕。韩国屏被捕后，在证据确凿的情况下，才承认了他的主要反革命事实。1956年11月，龙关县人民法院根据上述情况判处韩国屏有期徒刑八年，剥夺政治权利三年。1957年2月，河北省高级人民法院错误地撤销了上述判决，对韩国屏改判教育释放。
    最高人民检察院根据河北省人民检察院的检查，依法向最高人民法院提出抗议。最高人民法院根据最高人民检察院的抗议，对这一案件进行了审理，认为河北省高级人民法院对反革命分子韩国屏所交代的历史反革命问题及其在解放后的反革命造谣破坏行为，没有认真分析查究，即认定韩国屏历史反革命问题“已大部作了交代”，并说韩国屏在解放后继续进行反革命活动的行为是“落后与反动言行”，这显然是错误的。
