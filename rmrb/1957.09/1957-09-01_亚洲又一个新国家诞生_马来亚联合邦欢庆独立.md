    Xinhua News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, 31st - In the midst of joyous cries of "Independence," the capital of the Federation of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, officially raised its own national flag for the first time shortly after midnight today and played its own national anthem, "My Country." In this solemn flag-raising ceremony, a new independent nation in Asia, the Federation of Malaya, was declared born.
    Tens of thousands of people participated in the flag-raising ceremony at midnight on August 30th. As the clock on the City Hall struck twelve, the British flag, which had flown over Malaya for more than 170 years, was lowered for the last time, symbolizing the end of colonial rule. Excited crowds shouted "Independence" seven times. The flag representing the newly born Federation of Malaya was slowly raised. The flag has eleven alternating red and white stripes, representing the nine states and two autonomous states of the Federation. In the upper left corner of the flag is a yellow crescent moon and an eleven-pointed yellow star, set against a blue background, which is a symbol of Islamic countries.
    Rahman gave a speech saying, "Now is the greatest moment in the lives of the people of Malaya, because as the midnight bell tolls, a new nation is born - a nation that will immediately become free and independent." He pointed out, "A new star has risen in the eastern sky, another star of freedom for the Asian people."
    Subsequently, the masses braved the rain in the morning to participate in the independence ceremony held at the Independence Stadium. Representatives from more than 30 countries were invited to attend the ceremony. The Supreme Head of State of the Federation of Malaya, the Sultans of the states, etc., wearing magnificent national costumes, arrived in turn amidst the sound of trumpets. Finally, the Duke of Gloucester, the representative of the Queen of England, arrived with the documents for the transfer of power. In his speech at the ceremony, he read out the Queen of England's message to the people of Malaya.
    Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Prime Minister of the independent Federation of Malaya, accepted the documents for the transfer of power from the Duke of Gloucester, and then delivered a speech and read out the Declaration of Independence. Rahman shouted "Independence" at the end of his speech, and the crowd immediately cheered "Independence" like thunder.
    At 9:43 a.m., a flag-raising ceremony was held again amidst a 101-gun salute, followed by prayers.
    Today, towns and villages throughout the Federation of Malaya are gathering to celebrate independence.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 31st - Prime Minister Nehru said in a recorded broadcast on the evening of August 30th that Malaya's independence is another step forward for an awakening and resurgent Asia.
    Indian newspapers today prominently published news of Malaya's independence, congratulating Malaya on achieving freedom from Western colonialism.
    "The Times of India" and "Hindustan Standard" and other newspapers also pointed out that Britain will still control Malaya's policies and economy to a large extent. "Hindustan Standard" criticized Australian Foreign Minister Casey for trying to woo Malaya to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and accused Britain of urging Malaya not to invite Egypt, Syria, the Soviet Union, and China to the independence ceremony.

    亚洲又一个新国家诞生
    马来亚联合邦欢庆独立
    据新华社31日讯  吉隆坡消息：在万众欢呼“独立”的声中，马来亚联合邦首都吉隆坡今天在零时过后不久第一次正式升起了自己的国旗，演奏了自己的国歌“我的国家”。在这个庄严的升旗仪式中，一个亚洲的新的独立国——马来亚联合邦宣告诞生。
    8月30日午夜有数万人参加升旗仪式。当市政大楼的大钟敲十二下的时候，曾经在马来亚上空飘扬一百七十多年的英国国旗最后一次降下来，象征着殖民统治的结束。激动的群众七次高呼独立。代表着新生的马来亚联合邦的国旗冉冉上升。这面国旗有相间的红条和白条共十一条，代表联合邦的九个州和两个自治州。旗的左上角有黄色的新月和一个十一角的黄星，配上蓝色的底，这是伊斯兰国家的标志。
    拉赫曼发表演讲说，“现在是马来亚人民生活中最伟大的时刻，因为当午夜的钟声敲响的时候，一个新的国家诞生了——这个国家将立即成为自由和独立的。”他指出，“东方天空上升起了一颗新的明星，又一个亚洲民族的自由的明星。”
    随后，群众在早晨冒雨参加了在独立体育场举行的独立仪式。来自三十多个国家的代表应邀参加仪式。马来亚联合邦最高元首、各州苏丹等穿着金碧辉煌的民族服装在喇叭声中依次到场。最后，英国女王的代表格罗斯特公爵带着移交政权的文件到达。他在仪式上致词时宣读了英国女王的告马来亚民众书。
    独立的马来亚联合邦的第一任总理东古·阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼从格罗斯特公爵的手中接受了移交政权的文件，他接着发表了演说和宣读了独立宣言。拉赫曼在结束演讲时高呼“独立”，群众随即雷动般地欢呼“独立”。
    在上午九时四十三分，在一百零一响礼炮声中，再次举行升旗仪式，随后还举行了祈祷。
    今天，马来亚联合邦全国的市镇和乡村都集会庆祝独立。
    据新华社新德里31日电  尼赫鲁总理8月30日晚上在录音广播中说，马来亚的独立是在觉醒中的和复兴的亚洲向前迈进的又一步。
    印度各报今天以显著地位刊载马来亚独立的消息，祝贺马来亚摆脱西方殖民主义的控制而取得自由。
    “印度时报”和“印度斯坦旗报”等报纸还指出，英国仍将在很大的程度上控制马来亚的政策和经济。“印度斯坦旗报”批评澳大利亚外交部长凯西拉拢马来亚参加东南亚条约组织，并且指责英国促使马来亚不邀请埃及、叙利亚、苏联和中国参加独立典礼。
