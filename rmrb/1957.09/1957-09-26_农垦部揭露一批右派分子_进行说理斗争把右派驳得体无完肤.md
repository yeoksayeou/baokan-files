    The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation is currently conducting criticism against a group of rightists who were exposed during the movement.
    The rightists in this ministry, including Gao Jingqing, Wu Tong, Ye Mao, She Yisheng, Leng Tiemin, Ma Zongyuan, Xu Lenong, etc., made malicious slander and attacks against the Communist Party and the socialist system during the period of “great contending and blooming.” Gao Jingqing, the head of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party branch in the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, became giddy and overconfident shortly after the start of the rectification movement. He assessed the situation, saying, "It seems that the Communist Party members are in a position to be criticized and are isolated." He believed that the time had come to strike at the Communist Party. Therefore, he incited "three-anti" elements and those targeted during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries throughout the ministry to attack the Party. He also instructed members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to "only talk about shortcomings and not mention merits" of the Communist Party at various meetings. He himself took the lead in attacking the state farms and land reclamation cause, attacking the Party's leadership and personnel departments, defaming and vilifying Communist Party members, and sowing discord between the Party and the masses. After the anti-rightist struggle began, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, he actively arranged a retreat, telling Leng Tiemin, a Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party member and rightist, "Individuals should be responsible for their own words and should not involve the organization." Rightist Ye Mao completely agreed with Chu Anping's reactionary argument of a "Party-dominated world." He slandered our people's democratic dictatorship led by the Communist Party as being the same as the feudal dynasties and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. He said, "Chiang Kai-shek was most afraid of being called 'Chiang's world,' the emperors were most afraid of being called 'family's world,' and the Communist Party is most忌讳 (unwilling to mention) to be called 'Party's world,' the principle is exactly the same." After making a series of reactionary "Party-dominated world" remarks, he vaguely said that the Communist Party "cannot govern the country" and that the leading Party cadres "neither understand the work nor are democratic," implying that the Communist Party should step down. Rightist Ma Zongyuan spared no effort in vilifying and slandering the Communist Party. In a "fable" big-character poster he wrote, he vilified Communist Party members as "silly boys" who had no ability to think. He gritted his teeth and said that these "silly boys" deserved to be "black and blue all over." He also used the names of characters from the novel "Family," such as "Mingfeng" and "Juehui," as pseudonyms to write many big-character posters that slandered and attacked the Party's leadership, personnel work, and the relationship between the Party and the masses.
    The reactionary faces of these rightists have been exposed under the revelation of the broad masses of staff and workers of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. Some have been so thoroughly refuted that they have begun to lower their heads and confess their crimes.

    农垦部揭露一批右派分子
    进行说理斗争把右派驳得体无完肤
    本报讯　农垦部现正分别批判运动中被揭发出来的一批右派分子。
    这个部的右派分子高镜清、邬桐、叶懋、佘翊盛、冷铁民、马宗援、许乐农等，在大鸣大放中对共产党和社会主义制度进行了恶意的诬蔑和攻击。高镜清是农工民主党农垦部支部的负责人，整风运动开始不久，他得意忘形地估计形势说：“共产党员似乎是处在挨整的地位，孤立起来了，”认为打击共产党的时机已到。因此，便在部内到处煽动“三反”、肃反对象向党进攻，并且向农工民主党成员布置，要他们在各种会议上对共产党“只谈缺点，不提优点”。他本人还领先攻击农垦事业，攻击党的领导和人事部门，诽谤和丑化共产党员，挑拨党群关系。反右派斗争开始后，他见势不妙，又积极布置退却，告诉农工民主党党员、右派分子冷铁民说：“个人说话要个人负责，不要联系组织”。右派分子叶懋完全赞同储安平的“党天下”的反动论点，他诬蔑我国由共产党领导的人民民主专政的政权同封建王朝、蒋介石反动统治一样。他说：“蒋介石最怕说‘蒋天下’，皇帝最怕说‘家天下’，共产党最忌讳说‘党天下’，都是一样的道理”。他发了一通“党天下”的反动言论之后，又隐隐晦晦地说共产党“不会治天下”，党员领导干部“既不懂业务，又不民主”，意思是说共产党应该下台。右派分子马宗援竭力丑化，诽谤共产党，他写的一则“寓言”大字报，把共产党员都丑化成为一点思考能力都没有的“傻小子”。他咬牙切齿地说：这些“傻小子”“被打得鼻青脸肿”也是应该的。他还用小说“家”中的人物“鸣凤”、“觉慧”等名字作笔名，写了不少诬蔑和攻击党的领导、人事工作和党群关系的大字报。
    这些右派分子的反动面貌，在农垦部的广大工作人员揭发下，已经暴露出来，有的已被人们驳得体无完肤，开始低头认罪。
