Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department today carried out large-scale arrests of Japanese patriotic workers and students who had participated in the opposition to the expansion of the US military base. Those arrested included Onozera Masaomi, Secretary-General of the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation, and eight other students, as well as seventeen trade union members. The pretext for the arrests was that they had supported the struggle of residents of Sunagawa Town, Tokyo, against the expansion of the US military's Tachikawa base in June and July of this year, and had thereby "violated" the "Special Criminal Law" and "Violent Acts" regulations enacted under the Japan-US Administrative Agreement.

Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the Socialist Party, and the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation have already protested to the Metropolitan Police Department today.

On the same day, approximately three hundred Japanese students held a demonstration in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, demanding the release of the eight arrested students.
