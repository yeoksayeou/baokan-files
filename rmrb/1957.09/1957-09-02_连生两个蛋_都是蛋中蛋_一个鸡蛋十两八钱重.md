　　Laid Two Eggs in a Row - Both Eggs within Eggs
　　——One Egg Weighs Ten Taels and Eight Qian
　　Wang Jinghe, a member of the Yufeng Agricultural Cooperative in Shuyun Township, Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, had a hen that laid a large egg on July 2nd. This egg was four cun and five fen long, nine cun and seven fen in circumference, and weighed ten taels and eight qian. Inside this egg was another egg, the same size as a regular egg (weighing two taels and two qian). Three days after laying this large egg, the hen laid another large egg, weighing five taels and nine qian, which also contained an egg inside, weighing two taels and one qian. Both the large eggs had hard shells inside and out. The outer shell was pink and twice as thick as a regular eggshell, while the inner shell was a lighter color. Both the inner and outer eggs contained egg white and yolk, and when shaken before opening, there was a sound of movement inside.

　　Wang Jinghe's family raises a total of six hens. These chickens were hatched from eggs produced by mating local rooster breeds with "Australian Black" hens. They were hatched in the spring of last year, and the largest one weighs more than six jin. The hen that laid the two large eggs weighed four jin and fifteen liang and had reddish-brown feathers. It had not laid eggs for half a month before laying these two large eggs. After laying the second large egg, it continued to lay a regular-sized egg every day for five days in a row without interruption. Now, Wang Jinghe's family is specially feeding this hen to see if it can lay any more large eggs.

### 连生两个蛋  都是蛋中蛋——一个鸡蛋十两八钱重

    连生两个蛋  都是蛋中蛋
    ——一个鸡蛋十两八钱重
    江苏省灌云县树云乡裕丰农业社社员王景和家的一只母鸡，在7月2日生了一个大鸡蛋。这个蛋长四寸五分，腰围九寸七分，重十两八钱。这个蛋里面还有一个蛋，和一般鸡蛋一样大（重二两二钱）。这只鸡在生了这个大蛋后的第三天，又生了一个大蛋，重五两九钱，里面也有一个蛋，重二两一钱。这两个大蛋内外都是硬壳子，外蛋壳粉红色，比一般鸡蛋壳厚一倍，内蛋壳色较淡。内外蛋都有蛋白和蛋黄，在蛋打开前，摇晃内有动荡声音。
    王景和家共饲养了六只母鸡，这些鸡是用当地土种公鸡与“澳洲黑”母鸡交配生的蛋，去年春一窝孵出的，其中最大的一只重六斤多。连生两个大蛋的这只母鸡体重四斤十五两，羽毛酱色。它在生这两个大蛋以前有半个月没有生蛋。在生了第二个大蛋的第二天以后，每天还照常生一个像平时生的一般大的蛋，连生五个没有间断。现在王景和家将这只母鸡特地加工饲养，看看它还能不能再生大蛋。
