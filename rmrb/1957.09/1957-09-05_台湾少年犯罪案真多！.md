    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Taiwan "Police Department" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique recently admitted that the problem of juvenile crime in Taiwan is very serious. The number of juvenile offenders accounts for 20% of the total number of criminal offenders in Taiwan. This does not include general violations and minor criminal cases. Last year alone, the number of juvenile offenders reached 5,874, a two-fold increase compared to 1953. Since the beginning of this year, juvenile crime cases have increased further. Newspapers believe that the main reasons for the serious juvenile crime are: the bad social atmosphere in Taiwan; the temptation of American pornographic films, literature, and dramas that are rampant in Taiwan; the lack of institutions to provide relief for out-of-school and unemployed youth, and the lack of proper recreational activities for young people, resulting in a large number of young people wandering the streets; and the enticement of young people by a large number of hooligans and local bullies.

    台湾少年犯罪案真多！
    据新华社讯　蒋介石集团台湾“警务处”日前承认，台湾的少年犯罪问题非常严重。少年犯的人数，占台湾刑事案件人犯总数的20％。而一般违警和轻微刑事案还未包括在内。去年一年，少年犯人数达到五千八百七十四人，比1953年增加两倍。今年以来，少年犯罪案件更有所增加。报纸认为，造成少年犯罪严重的主要原因是：台湾社会风气太坏；少年们受到充斥台湾的美国色情电影、文艺、戏剧等诱惑；因为缺乏救济失学失业的机构和少年正当文娱活动场所，大量的少年流浪街头；大批流氓地痞对少年的引诱。
