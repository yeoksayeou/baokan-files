    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 31st: Félix, the leader of the Cameroonian People's Union, said in Khartoum on August 29th that the Cameroonian people are continuing their struggle for national liberation.

    In an interview with a Middle East News Agency reporter, Félix said that although the People's Union has now been ordered to be dissolved by British imperialists, and some of the Union's leaders have been arrested and deported, the nationalist movement of the five million Cameroonian people to liberate their motherland from British and French imperialism is still continuing underground under the leadership of the Union's secretary, fortunately escaping arrest, in the form of guerrilla warfare in the jungles.

    Félix and twelve other national movement leaders were recently deported by the British. They have been granted political asylum in Sudan.

    争取摆脱英法殖民枷锁
    喀麦隆人民打游击战
    据新华社开罗31日电  喀麦隆人民联盟领袖费利克斯8月29日在喀土穆说，喀麦隆人民正在继续进行争取民族解放的斗争。
    费利克斯在接见中东通讯社记者时说，虽然人民联盟现在已经被英帝国主义者下令解散，联盟的有些领袖被逮捕和驱逐出境，喀麦隆五百万人民摆脱英法帝国主义解放祖国的民族主义运动仍在人民联盟书记领导下，以在丛林中进行游击战的方式继续在地下进行，联盟的书记幸而没有遭到逮捕。
    费利克斯和另外十二个民族运动领导人员不久前被英国人驱逐出境。他们已经被允许在苏丹作政治避难。
