　　A Batch of Ancient Utensils of Ethnic Minorities
    The Yunnan Ethnic Minorities Social History Investigation Team of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, in the process of investigating the Jingpo, Kawa, Nu, and Dulong ethnic groups, collected more than 300 kinds of production and living utensils of these ethnic groups, which are of great significance for studying these ethnic groups. A wooden adze-like hand hoe, about twenty centimeters long, collected by the investigation team, was the main production tool of the Dulong people before liberation. Using this small wooden hoe to dig the ground, each person could dig about sixteen square meters of land per day. The fishing nets and crossbows collected by the investigation team were also the main production tools of the Dulong people. A larger number of stone tools were collected from the Nu ethnic group's inhabited areas in the Hengduan Mountains, including polished stone knives and a single-sided polished stone axe, which is extremely rare in archeology. The investigation team also collected an ancient Jingpo people's bullhorn fire starter, which is the most noteworthy item. The wooden hoes, crossbow arrows, bamboo wine jars, sacrificial supplies, etc. used by these ethnic groups provided the investigation team with many materials and clues to study the social development history of these ethnic groups.

　　一批少数民族古老的用品
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会云南少数民族社会历史调查组，在调查景颇、佧佤、怒、独龙等四个民族的工作过程中，搜集到这些民族的三百多种生产和生活用品，对研究这些民族颇有意义。调查组搜集到的一把长约二十公分的木质鹤嘴小手锄，是解放前独龙人的主要生产工具，使用这种小木锄挖地，每人每天约能挖十六平方公尺的土地；调查组搜集到的渔网和弩弓也是独龙人的主要生产工具。从横断山脉上怒族聚居地区搜集到的以石器较多，有磨光的石刀和考古学上极为罕见的一面磨光的石斧。调查组还搜集到最值得注意的一件古代景颇人使用的牛角取火器，这些民族使用的木锄、弩箭、竹酒罐、祭祀用品等，给调查组提供了许多材料和线索，来研究这些民族的社会发展史。
