Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 4th. News from Bonn: As the date of the West German Federal Assembly election approaches, the election campaigns of the West German political parties have entered a more intense stage.

    On September 3rd, the Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, proposed three major platforms: abolishing universal conscription; abandoning atomic armament for the West German army; and promoting the convening of a Four-Power Conference to discuss and resolve the issues of German unification and European security.
    Ollenhauer said: "If the Bonn government is allowed to continue to pursue its current foreign policy in the next four years, it will be extremely dangerous for the German people."

    Meanwhile, Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union has widely used the Catholic Church in its election campaign. Catholic priests and bishops have openly interfered in the election during sermons, openly calling on believers to vote for the Christian Democratic Union.

    Adenauer's partisans have also adopted Nazi-style election terror tactics. The reactionary youth organization of the Christian Democratic Union sent gangs of thugs to make noise and disrupt the Social Democratic Party's campaign rallies. They tore down Social Democratic Party campaign posters everywhere.

    西德竞选进入更紧张阶段
    社会民主党提出促成四大国会议等主张  阿登纳党利用宗教力量并采取恐怖手段
    据新华社柏林4日电　波恩消息：随着西德联邦议院选举日期的逼近，西德各政党的竞选活动已经进入更紧张的阶段。
    西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔9月3日提出了三大主张：废除普遍兵役制；放弃西德军队的原子装备；促成四大国会议的召开，以便讨论解决德国统一和欧洲安全问题。
    奥伦豪尔说：“如果允许在今后四年内继续执行波恩政府目前所奉行的外交政策，对德国人民来说，这将是极大的危险”。
    同时，阿登纳的基督教民主联盟在竞选活动中广泛地利用了天主教会。天主教神甫和主教在教坛讲话时竟公开干涉选举，公然号召教徒投票支持基督教民主联盟。
    阿登纳的党徒还采取了纳粹式的竞选恐怖手段。基督教民主联盟的反动青年组织派出成群结队的打手大叫大闹地捣乱社会民主党的竞选大会。他们到处扯毁社会民主党的竞选招贴。
