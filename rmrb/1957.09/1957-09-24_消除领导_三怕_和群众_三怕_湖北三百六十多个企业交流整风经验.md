Eliminating Leaders' "Three Fears" and the Masses' "Three Fears"
Over 360 Enterprises in Hubei Exchange Rectification Experiences

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, September 23rd) Over 360 state-owned industrial, construction, and transportation enterprises in Hubei Province are undergoing rectification. In over 90 of these units, the "Great Blooming and Contending" has reached a climax, with a few units entering the stage of focused rectification. Now, in every enterprise unit, one can see countless big-character posters, heated debates, criticisms, and self-criticisms. In many enterprise units, workers have submitted thousands of opinions in just two or three days. Leaders in various units are, according to the spirit of "rectifying while correcting," organizing considerable forces to address the opinions raised by the workers. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized an experience exchange conference on "Great Blooming and Contending" for various enterprise units, conducting visits and holding discussions, which promoted the development of the rectification movement.

This experience exchange conference made it clear that to carry out "Great Blooming and Contending," it is necessary to eliminate two sets of "three fears": The first is the leaders' "three fears"—fear of chaos, fear of hindering production, and fear of losing face. These fears stem from a lack of trust in cadres and the masses. It must be recognized that the majority of cadres and the masses are willing to improve their work and continuously develop the country's construction. Therefore, they are amenable to the truth. Boldly letting the masses express their opinions will not cause any problems. Units that have undergone "blooming and contending" have already proven this point. For example, in some units, there had been disturbances by the masses before the rectification. The leaders were particularly afraid of "Great Blooming and Contending" this time. Later, after explanations from relevant higher authorities, they implemented "Great Blooming and Contending." As a result, the masses voiced all their opinions. Not only did no disturbances occur, but they also actively assisted the leaders in handling the opinions raised. Second, it is necessary to eliminate the masses' "three fears"—fear of not being able to solve problems, fear of retaliation, and fear of being labeled as rightists. It is necessary to patiently explain to the masses that these "three fears" are unnecessary. For example, some people fear being labeled as rightists, so it is necessary to explain to them clearly that rectification and the anti-rightist struggle are two different types of struggles, and it is absolutely not allowed to treat contradictions among the people as contradictions between us and the enemy; it is necessary to improve work based on the opinions of the masses in a pragmatic way—sincerely and consistently implementing the principle of "rectifying while correcting."

    消除领导“三怕”和群众“三怕”
    湖北三百六十多个企业交流整风经验
    本报武汉23日电　湖北省国营工业、基建、交通等企业有三百六十多个单位进行整风，其中有九十多个单位的“大鸣大放”达到高潮，有少数单位进入着重整改阶段。现在人们走进每一个企业单位，可以看到数不清的大字报，热烈的辩论会、批评和自我批评。有不少企业单位的职工，在三两天内提出的意见达数千条之多。各单位的领导方面正在根据“边整边改”的精神，组织相当大的力量处理职工提出的意见。最近中共湖北省委组织各企业单位举行了一个“大鸣大放”经验交流大会，进行参观、座谈，推动了整风运动的开展。
    这次经验交流大会说明：开展“大鸣大放”，要消除两个“三怕”：第一个是领导的“三怕”——怕乱，怕妨碍生产，怕下不了台。这是由于不相信干部和群众而来的。要看到大多数干部、群众是愿意把工作搞好，使国家建设不断得到发展的，因此他们是服从真理的，大胆放手让群众提意见，不会出什么问题的，“鸣放”过的单位已经证明了这个道理。例如有的单位，在整风以前，曾经发生群众闹事，这次整风，领导就特别害怕“大鸣大放”，后来经过有关上级的解释，他们实行“大鸣大放”，结果，群众把意见都提出来了，不仅没有闹事，还积极协助领导处理提出的意见；第二，要消除群众的“三怕”——怕不能解决问题，怕打击报复，怕戴上右派分子的帽子。应该耐心给群众解释清楚存在这“三怕”是不必要的。例如有些人怕戴上右派分子的帽子，就要给他讲明白整风和反右派是两种不同性质的斗争，决不允许把人民内部矛盾当作敌我矛盾看待；要根据群众的意见实事求是地改进工作——真心实意地、贯彻始终地实现“边整边改”的方针。
