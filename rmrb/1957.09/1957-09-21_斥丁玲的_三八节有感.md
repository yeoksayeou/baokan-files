Denouncing Ding Ling's "Thoughts on March 8th"
	Luo Qiong, Dong Bian

In 1942, during the International Women's Day on March 8th, the Soviet Union's anti-fascist war of self-defense was at its most intense stage internationally; domestically, the Kuomintang reactionary rulers launched an anti-communist high tide nationwide, and after the Southern Anhui Incident, dispatched 300,000 reactionary troops to encircle the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Japanese invading forces frantically swept through the anti-Japanese base areas, and the War of Resistance Against Japan entered its most arduous stage. It was at such a time that Ding Ling fired the poisoned arrow of "Thoughts on March 8th," viciously attacking the Party and the new society, attempting to eliminate the fighting will of the revolutionary masses and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks.

At that time, Yan'an was the sacred place of the Chinese revolution, the heart that led the War of Resistance Against Japan. Yan'an, like a revolutionary crucible, cultivated hundreds of thousands of male and female cadres through work, production, and study, who went to the front lines of the War of Resistance. In order to cultivate a large number of female cadres, the Party absorbed a large number of women to participate in studies at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, Shaanbei Public School, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Military and Political College, and Nationalities Institute. In 1939, the China Women's University was founded, and thousands of women studied there intensely. In order to cultivate female cadres, the Party selected a large number of female cadres on various production fronts and at various work posts. They contributed their strength in labor and work, and tempered their awareness and ability. The Party was very concerned about the unique difficulties of women and the offspring of revolutionaries. Under the extremely difficult material conditions at the time, female cadres had maternity leave and maternity allowances, babies had nursing allowances, and even menstrual paper for female comrades was supplied by the public.

At that time, Yan'an was in the most difficult environment. The highest interest of the people was to win the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and to restore and develop the economy of the anti-Japanese base areas. The people fully supported the Party and the government in concentrating limited financial, material, and human resources to support the front lines of the War of Resistance and carry out the production and construction of the base areas. "Everything for the front" and "Everything for increasing production" had become the code of conduct for the people in the anti-Japanese base areas. Under the care and education of the Party, especially in the rectification movement and the great production movement launched by the Party, the female cadres in Yan'an greatly improved their revolutionary consciousness, transformed their old ideas, learned many revolutionary production skills, and consciously carried forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle. People wore cloth clothes, lived in cave dwellings, and ate millet. Such a hard and simple life made many female cadres more坚强strong, and many of them grew rosy and fat, living a lively, intense, serious, and happy revolutionary life.

Many female comrades correctly handled their love, marriage, and children issues. Due to political and ideological consistency in the revolutionary struggle, men and women developed mutual admiration, and consequently formed happy marriages. Such examples were abundant, common, and increasingly developing. When children were born, they tried their best to raise them. When there were not enough nurseries, and mothers had to work, not only did couples help each other and raise their children together; but also among female cadres, they advocated organizing small-scale mutual aid to take care of children and other methods, using the strength of collective mutual assistance to solve difficulties. In order to help some female cadres correct their incorrect views on love, marriage, and children, many responsible comrades personally provided education and guidance. They were educated to use communist moral principles to handle their marriage and family issues, and overcome petty-bourgeois ideas. They were educated to love their children as parents, and to consider raising children as part of revolutionary work. As a result, many of them did their work well and raised their children well. Until now, they are vigorously working in various positions for the construction of a beautiful socialist motherland.

Every one of us who has been to Yan'an, when we think of Yan'an, we will sincerely thank the Party and Chairman Mao for our cultivation, and we will think of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's earnest teachings. When we think of Yan'an, we will think of the simple and hardworking people of Yan'an, the heroic red-tasseled spears, the flowing Yan River, and the soaring songs. When we think of Yan'an, we yearn for that kind of intense revolutionary work, enthusiastic learning atmosphere, hard and simple life, and united and friendly feelings. Yan'an's Qingliang Mountain, Pagoda Mountain, Yan'an's millet, cave dwellings, and even every grass and tree in Yan'an, make us feel so亲切intimate and so可爱lovable. Yan'an is deeply imprinted in the hearts of each of us.

But how did Ding Ling view Yan'an? How did she view the lives of women in Yan'an? In "Thoughts on March 8th," she completely obliterated such a large number of true and确凿factual facts, and she described the women living in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an as humiliated and harmed people, as "female prisoners" living in a hell on earth. She even harshly said: "In the old society, they might be called pitiful and ill-fated, but today, they are paying for their own sins, they deserve it." The fate of female comrades in Yan'an is a trilogy: being forced to marry - going home to be a Nora - falling behind and being abandoned; and this tragic fate is blamed on the new society created by the Communist Party. This is simply slander, and besides exposing her extremely ugly soul that hates the Party, there is nothing real in it. Just think, anyone with a little sympathy for the revolution, anyone with a little sense of justice, who could issue such vicious slander against Yan'an and the female cadres full of revolutionary enthusiasm in the difficult years of the revolution?

In the face of such naked facts, Ding Ling still sophistically said that "Thoughts on March 8th" was not against the Party, that "she understands the suffering of women more," and that she was "speaking the innermost thoughts of a part of the people." Is Ding Ling really the defender of women's interests as she claims? Absolutely not. She treated Yan'an and the women's lives in Yan'an with such extreme侮蔑contempt; but she tried her best to cover up and embellish the suffering of women under the rule of the Kuomintang. Everyone knows that in the years of the Kuomintang rule, the vast number of working women suffered all kinds of slavery and oppression. And prostitutes were forced by life to fall into deep waters, living a tragic and inhuman life. They silently died from sexually transmitted diseases, poverty, and insults and damage. The bosses and madams went on replacing the old with the new, still drinking the blood of newcomers. This most cruel and barbaric prostitution system was the tumor of the old society. However, in her novel "A Small Room in Qingyun Lane," written in 1929, Ding Ling shamelessly described the brothel of the old society as a paradise, the attitude of customers towards prostitutes as more "interesting" than her beloved husband, and the relationship between the madam and the prostitutes as more loving than a mother and daughter. She wrote against her conscience: "Why does she (prostitute A Ying) have to marry? As for food and clothing, she doesn't worry about anything now, everything is taken care of by her 'Amu' (i.e. madam). As for lacking a husband, she doesn't waste any nights! And this is even more interesting... She doesn't have to do anything, except to sleep with a man, but this is not difficult, she is very used to it..."
(Selected Short Stories of Ding Ling, p. 135) Can you see a bit of sympathy for the ravaged and enslaved women here? Can you see a bit of dissatisfaction with the old society? "Thoughts on March 8th" and "A Small Room in Qingyun Lane" completely expose how ugly and filthy the soul of this soul engineer, this well-known writer at home and abroad, is! Beautiful feathers can no longer cover up the essence of hatred for the Party, hatred for the new social system, and praise for the old society and the old system, which has been hidden deep in her heart for a long time.

In "Thoughts on March 8th," what direction did Ding Ling try to lead women to? In 1942, in the whole country, except for a part of the territory under the jurisdiction of the People's Democratic Government led by the Communist Party of China; most of the country was under the puppet regime of Japanese imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The most urgent demand of the men and women of the whole country was to persist in the War of Resistance, persist in unity, persist in progress, and strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the liberation of all of China. However, in "Thoughts on March 8th," Ding Ling openly satirized the view that women's liberation must first change the old social system and seize power. In the difficult revolutionary environment, Ding Ling actually attempted to distort the direction of the revolution and eliminate the fighting will of the revolutionary masses, and her malicious intentions are evident here. She advocated extremely harmful bourgeois individualism, and tempted female cadres to abandon the revolution and struggle on their own. She said: "First strengthen yourself," "Strengthen yourself," "Then you are qualified to obtain all enjoyment." She used this extremely selfish and supreme individualistic thinking to erode women and to incite women against the Party and the new society. Is this speaking for women? Is this for women? Absolutely not. She violated the highest interests and lofty aspirations of women, and attempted to lure and incite women against the Party and the new society. Facts have proved that only by following the Communist Party and taking the socialist road can Chinese women be liberated. Therefore, many women wholeheartedly thank the Communist Party, and they say, "Father is 親dear, mother is 親dear, but the Communist Party is more 親dear," which truly expresses the women's love for the Party. This is also our women's resolute answer to the bourgeois rightists.

    斥丁玲的“三八节有感”
    罗琼　董边
    1942年三八国际妇女节，在国际上正是苏联反法西斯的自卫战争处在最激烈的阶段；在国内正是国民党反动统治者在全国范围内发动反共高潮，继皖南事变之后，又派遣了三十万反动大军包围陕甘宁边区。日本侵略军疯狂地扫荡各抗日根据地，抗日战争进入最艰苦的阶段。就在这样的时机，丁玲发出了“三八节有感”的毒箭，恶毒地向党向新社会进攻；妄想消灭革命群众的斗争意志，瓦解革命队伍。
    当时延安是中国革命的圣地，是领导抗日战争的心脏。延安像革命的熔炉一样，从工作中，生产中，学习中培养了几十万男女干部，大批地走上抗日前线。党为了大量培养女干部，在抗日军政大学、陕北公学、鲁迅艺术学院、军事政治学院、民族学院都吸收大量的妇女参加学习。1939年创立了中国女子大学，上千的妇女在这里紧张地学习。党为了培养妇女干部，在各种生产战线上、各种工作岗位上都选拔了大量妇女干部，她们在劳动中、工作中贡献自己的力量，并锻炼自己的觉悟和能力。党对妇女的特有的困难和革命后代是十分关怀的，在当时物质条件万分困难的情况下，女干部生育有产假，有生育补助费，婴儿有哺乳费，甚至女同志用的月经纸都由公家供给的。
    当时的延安，正是处在最艰苦的环境里，人民的最高利益是争取抗日战争的胜利，恢复和发展抗日根据地的经济。人民完全支持党和政府集中有限的财力物力和人力来支援抗日前线，进行根据地的生产建设。“一切为着前线”“一切为着增加生产”，这已经成为抗日根据地人民的行动准则。延安的女干部在党的关怀和教育下，特别在党所发动的整风运动和大生产运动中，大大提高了革命觉悟，旧的思想得到了改造，学会了许多革命的生产的本领，自觉地发扬了艰苦奋斗的革命的优良传统。人们穿着布衣，住着窑洞，吃着小米，这样艰苦朴素的生活，把许多女干部锻炼得更加坚强，很多人长得又红又胖，过着活泼、紧张、严肃、愉快的革命生活。
    很多女同志正确地处理了自己的恋爱、婚姻和孩子的问题。男女双方在革命斗争中由于政治上思想上一致而产生了相互爱慕，并从而结成了美满婚姻，这种事例是大量地普遍地存在并日益发展着的。生了子女，尽力的扶育。托儿所不够，妈妈又要工作，在这种情况面前，不仅在夫妇之间互相帮助，共同扶育子女；还在女干部之间提倡了组织小型互助带孩子等种种办法，用集体互助的力量，解决困难。为了帮助一部分女干部纠正自己在恋爱、婚姻、孩子问题上不正确的看法，许多负责同志亲自给予教育和指导。教育她们用共产主义的道德原则来处理自己的婚姻和家庭问题，克服小资产阶级的思想。教育她们应尽父母之力来爱护小孩，要把扶育小孩当做革命工作的一部分。因而她们之中许多人既做好了工作，又带好了孩子，直到现在她们都生气勃勃地在各个岗位上为建设美好的社会主义祖国而不懈地努力。
    我们每个到过延安的人，想到延安，就会衷心地感激党和毛主席对我们的培育，就会想到毛主席和党中央对我们谆谆的教导。我们想到延安，就会想到延安淳厚勤朴的人民，雄赳赳的红缨枪，奔流的延水，和昂扬的歌声。想到延安，我们就向往着那种紧张的革命工作，热烈的学习空气，艰苦朴素的生活，团结友爱的情谊。延安的清凉山、宝塔山，延安的小米，窑洞，乃至延安的一草一木，都使我们感觉到那样亲切，那样可爱。延安，深深印在我们每一个人的心里。
    可是丁玲是怎样看待延安？怎样看待延安的妇女生活呢？在“三八节有感”里，她完全抹煞了这样大量的千真万确的事实，她把生活在革命圣地的延安的妇女，描写成是受屈辱受损害的人，是生活在人间地狱的“女犯”。她甚至苛毒地说：“在旧的社会里，她们或许会被称为可怜，薄命，然而在今天，却是自作孽、活该。”延安女同志的命运是三部曲：就是被迫结婚——回家当娜拉——落后被遗弃；而把这种悲惨的命运又归罪于是共产党一手缔造的新社会。这简直完全是诬蔑，除了暴露了她仇恨党的极端丑恶的灵魂之外，没有一点真实的东西。试想一想，一个只要对革命稍有一些同情心的人，只要稍稍有正义感的人，谁能在革命艰苦的年月里，对延安，对满腔革命热情的女干部，发出这样恶毒的诬蔑呢？
    在这样赤裸裸的事实面前，丁玲还狡辩地说“三八节有感”不是反对党的，“她更懂得女人的痛苦”，她是“代表一部分人说出了心里的话”。丁玲真是像她所说的是妇女利益的维护者吗？完全不是的。她对待延安和延安的妇女生活，是这样极尽侮蔑的能事；但对国民党统治下的妇女痛苦，则尽力掩盖和粉饰。谁都知道在国民党统治的年月里，广大劳动妇女受尽了人间的奴役和压迫。而妓女们为生活所迫，陷入水深火热之中，过着悲惨的非人的生活，她们在性病、穷困、被侮辱被损害中无声的死去。而老板、领家则去旧来新，仍然坐喝新来者的血。这种最残酷最野蛮的娼妓制度，是旧社会的病瘤。而丁玲在她1929年写的“庆云里中的一间小房里”的小说里，无耻地把旧社会的妓女院描写成为天堂乐园，把嫖客对妓女的态度描写得比自己心爱的丈夫还“有趣”，把老鸨母和妓女的关系，描写成为超过母女的热爱。她昧着良心地写道：“她（妓女阿英）为什么定要嫁人呢？说吃饭穿衣，她现在并不愁什么，一切都由阿姆（即老鸨母）负担了。说缺少了一个丈夫，然而她夜夜并不虚过呀！而且这只有更能觉得有趣的……她什么事都可以不做，除了去陪一个男人睡，但这事并不难，她很惯于这个了。……”
   （丁玲短篇小说选集135页）这里能看出她对被蹂躏被奴役的妇女有一点同情心吗？能看出她对旧社会有一点不满吗？“三八节有感”和“庆云里中的一间小房里”完全暴露了这个灵魂工程师，这个闻名国内外的“作家”的灵魂是如何丑恶肮脏啊！美丽的羽毛，再也掩盖不住久藏在她心的深处的仇恨党仇恨新社会制度，歌颂旧社会旧制度的本质了。
    在“三八节有感”里，丁玲企图把妇女引向什么方向呢？1942年，在全国范围内，除掉一部分国土在中国共产党领导的人民民主政府的管辖之下；全国绝大部分国土是在日本帝国主义伪政权和国民党反动统治之下，全国男女人民的最迫切要求是坚持抗战，坚持团结，坚持进步，争取抗日战争的最后胜利，解放全中国。但是丁玲在“三八节有感”里公然讽刺妇女解放首先要改变旧的社会制度、夺取政权的论点。在艰苦的革命环境里，丁玲竟企图歪曲革命方向，消灭革命群众的斗志，其用心的恶毒于此可见。她提倡极端有害的资产阶级个人主义，引诱女干部抛弃革命，自我奋斗。她说：“首先强己”，“强己”，“才有资格去获取一切享受”。她用这种极端自私自利的个人至上的思想来侵蚀妇女，来煽动妇女反对党反对新社会。这难道是代表妇女说话吗？这难道是为了妇女吗？完全不是的，她违背了妇女的最高利益和崇高的愿望，企图引诱和煽动妇女反对党反对新社会。事实证明只有跟共产党走社会主义道路，中国妇女才获得了解放，所以许多妇女衷心感谢共产党，她们说“爹亲、娘亲、没有共产党亲”，真正表示了妇女们对党的热爱，这也是我们妇女对资产阶级右派分子的坚决的回答。
