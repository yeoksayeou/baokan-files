Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Premier Kádár told more than ten thousand teachers and students at Tsinghua University today that Hungary has now restored normal legal order. After the struggle of the Hungarian incident, the strength of the Hungarian people has not weakened, but has become stronger.

While Premier Kádár was saying these words, the teachers and students of Tsinghua University expressed their congratulations to the Hungarian people with prolonged applause.

Premier Kádár and all members of the Government Delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic, led by him, visited Tsinghua University this morning accompanied by He Long, Zeng Yongquan, and Hao Deqing. The guests were warmly welcomed by Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, and all the teachers and students of the university. After the visit, Premier Kádár spoke to the teachers and students on the sports field.

Premier Kádár said that the Hungarian people have been engaged in arduous struggles for a year. This struggle is manifested as a struggle between the people who support the people's regime and the imperialists. Since the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots occurred, the whole world has been talking about Hungary. Those who support the capitalist system scold Hungary; those who support socialism care for and support the Hungarian people with love and sympathy, and give the Hungarian people great assistance. In this ranks, the great Chinese people have always stood at the forefront, regarding the Hungarian people as their brothers and friends, and we are very happy.

The leader of the already consolidated Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government said that those believers in capitalism and imperialism, those warmongers and traitors to the revolution scold us, we don't think it matters; but we feel very honored that the working people and all upright people stand with us.

He said that the Hungarian rioters described the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots as a "national revolution" and a "patriotic" action. Nagy agreed with this statement. Nagy and Hungary's Cardinal Mindszenty sang the same tune as Dulles. They are not revolutionaries, but can only be said to be traitors to the people. True patriots can only stand on the side of the people, and support the people's democratic system and oppose imperialism.

Premier Kádár said that those who attacked the people's democratic system once put forward the slogan of demanding "freedom" to us. Freedom is a beautiful word and a sacred concept. However, we must see whether they are fighting for freedom for the working people who are lingering in the capitalist system, or for those who oppose the people's democratic system. We say that freedom must be given to the working people, but no freedom should be given to those who oppose the people's democratic system. For the sake of socialism, the freedom of the minority who oppose the people's democratic system must be restricted.

Premier Kádár said that in Hungary, the party's leadership over the government must never be deprived. The declining class cannot lead social life. Social life must be led by the proletariat and its political party - the Communist Party.

Talking about the youth issue, Premier Kádár said that although the enemy uses beautiful words to deceive the youth, the youth will not be deceived. Our party loves the youth and regards the youth as the future of the country and the hope of mankind. We are glad to know that the Chinese youth, under the leadership of the working class party, have carried out a long-term revolutionary struggle. We believe that Chinese youth should defend the victorious fruits of the people's revolution with work, study, and even weapons when necessary. Only in this way can we be worthy of the party and the government's love for you.

Premier Kádár said that the People's Republic of China has 600 million people, is a great nation, and is a great country. Its greatness is not only because of its large population, but because its people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have victoriously established the People's Republic of China after decades of struggle. It is loved and respected by the people of the world. Your task, the Chinese youth, is to use your performance to treat the love and respect of the people of these countries for you.

Finally, this glorious envoy of the Hungarian people also wished all teachers and students of Tsinghua University greater achievements in their work and study.

Premier Kádár's speech inspired the teachers and students of Tsinghua University. At the end of his speech, the ten thousand teachers and students standing on the square burst into thunderous applause, and they raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the Hungarian people!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" At this time, Premier Kádár, standing on the podium, faced the bright sunshine and frequently waved to the enthusiastic youth.

Jiang Nanxiang delivered a speech welcoming the distinguished guests before Premier Kádár spoke.

Today, the distinguished guests, guided by their hosts, visited the hydraulic experiment hall and the hydraulic hub station. In the hydraulic experiment hall, Premier Kádár and others carefully watched the model test conducted by the students for the Liujiaxia Reservoir on the Yellow River.

During the visit, Jiang Nanxiang introduced to the distinguished guests that Tsinghua University was founded in 1911. Before liberation, there were only 2,000 students, and the current number of students is more than five times that before liberation.

After the visit to Tsinghua University, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long and others, visited the Summer Palace and had lunch there.

    卡达尔总理对清华大学万余师生讲话
    匈牙利人民的力量更加坚强了
    勉励中国青年在党的领导下坚决保卫革命果实
    新华社28日讯　卡达尔总理今天对清华大学的一万多师生说，今天匈牙利已经恢复了正常的法律秩序，经过匈牙利事件的斗争，匈牙利人民的力量不是削弱了，而是更加坚强了。
    在卡达尔总理讲这些话的时候，清华大学的师生们以长时间的掌声向匈牙利人民表示祝贺。
    卡达尔总理和他率领的匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团的全体人员，今天上午由贺龙、曾涌泉、郝德青陪同参观了清华大学。贵宾们受到了高等教育部部长杨秀峰、清华大学校长蒋南翔和全校师生的热情欢迎。在参观以后，卡达尔总理在运动场上向师生们讲了话。
    卡达尔总理说，一年以来，匈牙利人民进行了艰苦的斗争。这个斗争表现为拥护人民政权的人民同帝国主义者之间的斗争。自从匈牙利反革命暴乱发生以后，全世界都谈论匈牙利。拥护资本主义制度的人责骂匈牙利；拥护社会主义的人怀着热爱和同情关怀着匈牙利人民，支持匈牙利人民，并且给匈牙利人民以巨大的援助。在这个行列里，伟大的中国人民始终站在队伍的前列，把匈牙利人民看作是自己的兄弟和朋友，我们感到很高兴。
    这位已经巩固了的匈牙利工农革命政府的领导人说，那些资本主义和帝国主义者的信徒，那些战争贩子和革命叛徒责骂我们，我们认为并不要紧；而劳动人民和一切正直的人同我们站在一起，我们却感到非常光荣。
    他说，匈牙利暴乱者把匈牙利的反革命暴乱，说成是“民族革命”，是“爱国”的行动。纳吉赞同这种说法。纳吉和匈牙利的红衣主教明曾蒂同杜勒斯是一个鼻孔出气的。他们不是革命者，只能说他们是人民的叛徒。真正的爱国者，只能站在人民一边，并且拥护人民民主制度，反对帝国主义。
    卡达尔总理说，那些向人民民主制度进攻的人，曾经向我们提出要求“自由”的口号。自由是一个美丽的名词，神圣的概念。但是，我们要看一看他们是为在资本主义制度下苟延残喘的劳动人民争取自由，还是为反对人民民主制度的人争取自由。我们说，对劳动人民必须给予自由，而对反对人民民主制度的人绝不能给自由。为了社会主义，对少数反对人民民主制度的人的自由必须加以限制。
    卡达尔总理说，在匈牙利，党对政府的领导绝对不能被剥夺。没落阶级是不能领导社会生活的。社会生活必须由无产阶级及其政党——共产党来领导。
    谈到青年问题时，卡达尔总理说，尽管敌人用美好的言词欺骗青年，但青年们是不会被欺骗的。我们的党爱护青年，把青年看作是国家的未来，人类的希望。我们高兴地知道，中国青年在工人阶级政党的领导下，曾经进行了长期的革命斗争。我们认为，中国青年应该以工作、学习、必要时甚至以武器，来保卫人民革命的胜利果实。这样才不愧党和政府对你们的爱护。
    卡达尔总理说，中华人民共和国拥有六亿人口，是一个伟大的民族，是一个伟大的国家。它的伟大，不仅是因为人口众多，而是因为它的人民在中国共产党的领导下，经过几十年的斗争，胜利地诞生了中华人民共和国。它受到了全世界人民的爱戴和尊重。你们，中国的青年们的任务，就是要用自己的表现，对待这些国家的人民对你们的爱戴和尊重。
    这位匈牙利人民的光荣使者最后还祝清华大学全体师生在工作和学习中获得更大的成就。
    卡达尔总理的讲话鼓舞了清华大学的师生们，在他讲话结束的时候，伫立在广场上的万名师生掌声雷动，他们振臂高呼：“匈牙利人民万岁！”“中匈两国人民的友谊万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”这时候，在讲台上的卡达尔总理，迎着灿烂的阳光，向着热情奔放的青年们频频挥手致意。
    蒋南翔在卡达尔总理讲话以前曾致词欢迎贵宾。
    今天，贵宾们由主人们引导，参观了水力实验馆和水力枢纽站。在水力实验馆，卡达尔总理等仔细地观看了学生们为黄河刘家峡水库进行的模型试验。
    在参观时，蒋南翔向贵宾介绍说，清华大学创立于1911年，解放前只有学生两千人，目前的学生人数为解放前的五倍多。
    在清华大学参观结束后，贵宾们又由贺龙副总理等陪同游览了颐和园，并且在那里进午餐。
