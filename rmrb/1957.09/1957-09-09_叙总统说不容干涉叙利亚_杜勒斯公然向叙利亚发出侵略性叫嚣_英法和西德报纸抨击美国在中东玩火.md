Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: Syrian President Kuwatli said on September 7th, "We will never allow anyone to interfere in our affairs, nor will we allow anyone to divide our national front."

Kuwatli also said when meeting with reporters from the "Middle East News Agency" in Damascus, the Syrian capital, that Syria's political and economic situation is very sound. We believe the future belongs to us, even though some are trying to tighten their control over us. We have the ability to shatter this chain, no matter how strong they think it is.

Kuwatli said, "Our relationship with the Soviet Union is friendly, sincere, and based on mutual benefit. We have no secret agreements with the Soviet Union; all agreements have been made public. We are not communists, nor does anyone want us to be communists. We are nationalists, and we will not exchange Arab nationalism for anything else."

Syrian newspapers report that the United States is intensifying its new conspiracy against Syria. "Al-Madina" said that a few days ago, American ships carrying troops, heavy weapons, and military equipment for the Turkish army arrived at Turkish ports. These troops are commanded by American generals. They will hold joint exercises with the Turkish army. A large number of American weapons, including new tanks, will also be shipped to Jordan in the near future, and American military advisers will go there at the same time.

According to "Al-Jamahir": "U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson jointly formulated a joint plan to invade Syria with the leaders of Turkey, Lebanon, and Israel, with Turkey and Israel launching armed attacks on Syria, and Iraq and Jordan also guaranteeing to carry out a series of provocations on the Syrian border according to a pre-determined plan. At the same time, Lebanon will open its borders to bandits and other conspirators composed of exiled Syrian National Social Party members, allowing them to infiltrate Syria to carry out subversive activities."

Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued an aggressive statement on September 7 regarding the situation in Syria, stating that the U.S. government would use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to send military supplies to Middle Eastern countries to directly interfere in the Syrian situation.

This statement was issued after Eisenhower met with Dulles, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson, and Assistant Secretary of State Rountree. Eisenhower specially interrupted his vacation to return to Washington for this meeting. During the meeting, Henderson reported on his recent trip to the Middle East, expressing "deep concern" about the development of the situation in Syria, and falsely accused the Soviet Union of "controlling" Syria and the Syrian government of attempting to "overthrow the governments of its Arab neighbors."

The statement also openly clamored to continue subversive activities in Syria, demanding that the "Syrian people" take action to eliminate the United States' "unease" about the Syrian situation.

On the same day, French Foreign Minister Pineau met with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. It is reported that Pineau urgently wanted to reach an agreement on joint steps between the United States, Britain, and France to avoid new difficulties for the West on the Syrian issue. However, an American spokesperson admitted after the meeting that no agreement had been reached on any joint steps to deal with the Syrian situation.

Dulles and Pineau also discussed France's difficulties in Algeria. It is reported that, in view of the upcoming UN General Assembly discussion on the Algerian issue again, France hopes to obtain American support.

The U.S. policy in the Middle East has aroused criticism from British, French, and West German newspapers.

London's "The Times" said that the actions of the Americans in the Near East are sometimes so intense that they can even be described as "provocative." The newspaper asked, "Should Britain's role only be to passively follow American policy? It is very clear that this policy is indecent to many Britons and may sometimes unintentionally damage British interests."

Many newspapers in Paris on September 7th emphasized that the U.S. government's decision to transport weapons to Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey has created an extremely tense situation in the Near and Middle East and is fraught with extremely serious consequences. "Liberation" pointed out that without accepting the suggestions in the Soviet government's notes to the three Western governments, no agreement in the Middle East is possible.

West Germany's "Neue Rhein Zeitung" also criticized the U.S. policy in the Near East. The newspaper pointed out that Washington has made the current events in the Near East tragic. The U.S. sending weapons to the Near East is like playing with fire and burning oneself.

    叙总统说不容干涉叙利亚
    杜勒斯公然向叙利亚发出侵略性叫嚣
    英法和西德报纸抨击美国在中东玩火
    本报综合报道　据新华社8日讯：叙利亚总统库阿特利7日说：“我们决不容许任何人干涉我们的事务，也不容许任何人分裂我们的民族阵线。”
    库阿特利在叙利亚首都大马士革接见“中东通讯社”记者时还说，叙利亚的政治经济形势非常健全。我们相信将来是属于我们的，虽然有人企图加紧来控制我们。我们有能力粉碎这个锁链，不管他们自认为这个锁链多么坚固。
    库阿特利说：“我们同苏联的关系是友好的，真挚的，是以互利为基础的。我们同苏联没有秘密协定，所有的协定都已经公之于世。我们不是共产主义者，也没有人要我们成为共产主义者。我们是民族主义者，我们不会以阿拉伯民族主义来换取其他任何东西。”
    叙利亚报纸报道，美国正在加紧进行对叙利亚的新阴谋。“文明报”说，几天前，装载军队、重型武器以及供应土耳其军队军事装备的美国船只开到了土耳其港口。这些部队是由美国将领指挥的。他们将同土耳其的军队一起举行联合演习。最近期间，包括新式坦克在内的大批美国武器也将运往约旦，美国的军事顾问将同时前往。
    据“群众报”报道：“美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊同土耳其、黎巴嫩和以色列的领导人共同制定了侵略叙利亚的联合计划，由土耳其和以色列对叙利亚发动武装进攻，伊拉克和约旦也保证将根据已定计划在叙利亚边境进行一系列的挑衅。同时，黎巴嫩将对流亡在外的叙利亚国家社会党人所组成的匪帮和其他阴谋家开放边境，让他们潜入叙利亚进行颠覆活动。”
    华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯9月7日就叙利亚局势发表侵略性声明，表示美国政府要运用“艾森豪威尔主义”，向中东国家运送军事物资，来直接干涉叙利亚局势。
    这个声明是艾森豪威尔同杜勒斯、副国务卿帮办汉德逊和助理国务卿朗特里会谈后发表的。艾森豪威尔特地中断休假赶回华盛顿举行了这次会谈。在会谈中，汉德逊作了关于他最近的中东之行的报告，这个报告对叙利亚的事态发展表示“深为不安”，并且诬蔑苏联“控制”叙利亚以及叙利亚政府企图“推翻它的阿拉伯邻国的政府”。
    声明还公开叫嚣要在叙利亚继续进行颠覆活动，要求“叙利亚人民”采取行动来消除美国对叙利亚局势的“不安情绪”。
    同一天，法国外交部长比诺同美国国务卿杜勒斯举行会谈。据悉，比诺迫切要就美英法三国的共同步骤达成协议，以免西方在叙利亚问题上遭到新的困难。但是美国发言人在会谈以后承认，没有就应付叙利亚局势的任何联合步骤达成协议。
    杜勒斯和比诺还讨论了法国在阿尔及利亚的困难。据悉，鉴于联合国大会不久将再次讨论阿尔及利亚问题，法国希望得到美国的支持。
    美国在中东的政策引起了英国、法国和西德报纸的纷纷抨击。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”说，美国人在近东的行动有时激烈到这种程度，以致甚至可以把它们说成是“挑衅性的”。这家报纸问道：“英国的作用是否应该只是被动地追随美国的政策呢？非常明显，这种政策对许多英国人来说是不体面的，而有时可能会无意地损害英国的利益。”
    巴黎许多报纸7日都强调指出，美国政府运送武器到约旦、伊拉克和土耳其去的这一决定在中近东造成极其紧张的局势，并且孕育着极为严重的后果。“解放报”指出，不接受苏联政府给西方三国政府照会中的建议，中东的任何协定都不可能生效。
    西德“新莱因报”也抨击美国在近东的政策。报纸指出，华盛顿使得目前近东的事件变成悲剧性的了。美国运送武器到近东等于玩火自焚。
