Blessings to the Mongolian People
--Watching the Mongolian Color Documentary "Modern Mongolia"

The Mongolian color documentary "Modern Mongolia" begins with the glorious rising sun and children gathering plants in the fields, a very clever connection and meaningful conception. The sun symbolizes human life, and children are our future. The filmmakers recorded the infinitely beautiful life of the Mongolian People's Republic with this passion of praising life and praising youth. From the very beginning of the film, we were deeply attracted to it and watched it with excitement from beginning to end.

The film introduces us to the ancient city ruins of Mongolia in ancient times, solemn and sacred temples, and many huge ancient animal fossils on the vast plains. If those fossils could speak, they would surely tell us many fascinating legends about Mongolia in ancient times. But what interests us even more is the film's narrative about the revolutionary years of 1921 and modern life.

From paintings and sculptures, we see the meeting between Sukhe Bator, the outstanding son of the Mongolian people, and Lenin, as well as the scenes of Sukhe Bator and Choibalsan engaging in revolutionary activities. It was from that time that Mongolia moved from a backward country to the road of liberation.

The life of the Mongolian people, as shown in the film, is inspiring. The filmmakers created many beautiful and poetic pictures for us. We see herds of cattle covering the entire grassland, and flocks of sheep covering the hillsides. Mongolia ranks first in the world in terms of the number of livestock. The Mongolian people are mostly engaged in animal husbandry, and the animal husbandry experience passed down through generations is now used to serve the construction of the new Mongolia.

The relationship between the Mongolian people and horses is inseparable. We see brave horse trainers conquering wild horses, and we also see several "Young Pioneers" riding strong and handsome horses to school instead of walking or taking a car.

In addition to developed animal husbandry, various crops also grow on the land of Mongolia. Cultivation is carried out by machines, and people who have lived a nomadic life for many years now settle in ideal places. Mongolia's land is also home to various rare birds and animals. Hunters use tamed golden eagles to capture small wild animals, or they use their own unparalleled alertness and wisdom to capture wild animals. We see that the furs produced in Mongolia are obtained by these hardworking hunters.

The film introduces us to the simple Mongolian people with very vivid pictures. We see farmers sitting around the radio listening to broadcasts after a day of work, drinking fresh mare's milk; we see a mother in a crowded department store choosing a suitable leather coat for her beloved daughter; we also see joyful crowds enjoying acrobatic performances in the circus at night.

The day of the election has arrived. A young mother smiles as she puts her ballot into the ballot box while holding her son. Comrade Tsedenbal and an old herdsman cast their votes together. And who are the people they elected into the government? The film introduces the elected citizens to us in a very concise manner. They are a female tailor from a shoe factory, a milking woman from a pasture, a captain who started as a driver, a farmer, and a famous playwright.

During the Mongolian people's celebration of their National Day, the film introduces the "Naadam" festival. The wrestling competition with rich national characteristics begins. Each participant is tall and strong. After a fierce battle, the winners dance with their arms outstretched towards the judges according to traditional rituals. The most interesting thing is that children as young as six or seven years old also come here to compete, but whether they fail or win, each person unexpectedly receives a prize. So they also learn from their fathers, dancing with their arms outstretched, jumping happily...

In the sharp, high-pitched singing with primitive flavor, the archery activity begins. The archers wear national costumes and carefully draw their bows with squinting eyes. Here, the photographer leaves us with many richly colored pictures, and the director also intersperses many light and interesting shots for us.

In this film, we see the beauty of Mongolian nature and the richness of the land. It is true that the Mongolian people proudly call their land the cradle of gold. But what impresses us most is the Mongolian people. Even now, I still remember the middle-aged man who is studying at the medical university. He won the title of hero in the war against the invaders, but now he has become a famous surgeon. His hands that once held guns are now performing complex operations for a patient. This is a vivid and thought-provoking fact. The life path of the Mongolian people is like the one walked by this surgeon. They love their motherland and have contributed everything to her in the past. In order to defend her, they did not hesitate to take up guns and aim them at the enemy's chest. Now, in the era of peaceful construction, their hands bring happiness and warmth to people. The Mongolian people are so sincere, brave, and hardworking. We wish the Mongolian people greater achievements in building their motherland!

    祝福蒙古人民
    ——看蒙古彩色记录片“现代蒙古”
    江之水
    蒙古彩色记录片“现代蒙古，”以光彩富丽的初升太阳和在田野里采集植物的孩子们作开头，这是一种极为巧妙的联系和富有含义的构思。太阳象征人类的生命，孩子是我们的未来，影片创作者就是以这种歌颂生活，歌颂青春的激情，为我们记录下蒙古人民共和国无限美好的生活。从影片开头的最初时刻起，我们就被它深深的吸引，始终是怀着一种激动的心情看完了这张影片的。
    影片向我们介绍了蒙古远古年代的古城遗迹，庄严肃穆的庙宇，以及在那辽阔的平原上的许多巨大的古代动物化石。假如那些化石能够说话，它一定会告诉我们许多迷人的关于远古时代蒙古的传说。但，引起我们更大兴趣的，还是影片叙述到1921年革命年代和现代的生活。
    从绘画和雕塑作品里，我们看到了蒙古人民优秀的儿子——苏赫巴托尔和列宁的会见，苏赫巴托尔和乔巴山从事革命活动的场景，也就从那个时候起，蒙古才由一个落后的国家，走向解放的道路。
    影片展现的蒙古人民的生活，是令人振奋的。影片创作者为我们摄制了许多色彩优美、富有诗意的画面，我们看到牛群遮盖了整个草原，羊群布满了山坡，蒙古牲畜的多，在世界上是占第一位的。蒙古人民也多从事畜牧业，他们世世代代留传下来的畜牧经验，如今都用来为新蒙古的建设而服务了。
    蒙古人民和马的关系是分不开的，我们看到剽悍的驯马者征服了疯狂的野马，我们也看到几个“红领巾”在上学校去的路上，不是走路或乘车，而是骑着几匹矫健骏俏的马。
    除了发达的畜牧业，蒙古的土地上也生长着各种农作物，耕作是用机器进行的，多年过着游牧生活的人们，现在都定居在理想的地方。蒙古的土地上还有着各种奇禽异兽，猎户们用驯服了的雄鹫捕捉小野兽，或者自己用无比的机警和智谋捕捉野兽。我们看到蒙古盛产的皮毛，就是由这些辛苦的猎人们获取而来的。
    影片用十分生动的画面向我们介绍了朴实的蒙古人民，我们看到了农民们在劳动了一天之后，端着新鲜的马奶，围坐在收音机旁收听广播；我们看到了在拥挤的百货商店里，一位母亲正为自己心爱的女儿挑选一件合适的皮大衣；我们也看到了夜晚在马戏场里欣赏杂技表演的欢乐的人群。
    选举的日子到了，年轻的妈妈抱着儿子微笑地把选票投入票箱；泽登巴尔同志和年老的牧民在一起投了票，而他们所选入政府去的都是些什么人呢？影片用十分简洁的手法向我们介绍了那些被选的公民。他（她）们是皮鞋厂的女裁缝、牧场的挤奶女工、司机出身的船长、农场的庄员和著名的剧作家。
    在蒙古人民庆祝自己国庆的日子里，影片介绍了举行“那达慕”大会的情形。富有民族色彩的摔跤比赛开始了，参加比赛者个个都高大雄壮，经过一场激烈的争战，得胜者都按照传统仪式张舞着两臂欢跃地跳向评判员。最有意思的是只有六七岁的孩子们也来到这里比赛，可是不管他们失败或得胜了，每人都意外地得了奖品，于是他们也学着父辈们的样子张舞着双臂，欢乐地跳跃着……。
    在带有原始风味的尖昂的歌唱声中射箭活动开始了，射手们穿着民族服装，眯缝着眼睛小心地拉满了弓弦。在这里，摄影师为我们留下许多幅色彩沉厚的画面，导演也为我们穿插了不少轻松有趣的镜头。
    我们在这部电影里看到蒙古大自然的美好，土地的富饶，蒙古人民骄傲地称自己的土地为黄金的摇篮是不假的。但给我们印象最深的还是蒙古的人民。到现在，我还记得那个在医科大学进修的中年男子，他在抗击侵略者的战争中曾获得过英雄称号，如今却成为著名的外科医生。他的过去握枪的双手现在正为一个病人作着复杂的手术，这是一个生动的耐人寻味的事实，蒙古人民的生活道路就像这位外科医生所走过来的一样，他们热爱自己祖国，在过去的年代曾为她贡献过一切，为了保卫她不惜拿起枪来对准敌人的胸膛。如今和平建设的年代，他们的双手却给人们带来幸福和温暖，蒙古人民就是如此真诚、勇敢、勤劳，我们祝福蒙古人民在建设自己祖国的道路上获得更大的成就！
