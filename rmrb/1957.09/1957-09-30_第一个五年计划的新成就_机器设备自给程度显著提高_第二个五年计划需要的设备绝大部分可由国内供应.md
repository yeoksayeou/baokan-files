Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The degree of self-sufficiency in machinery and equipment in China is continuously improving. It is estimated that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the vast majority of machinery and equipment needed by various sectors of the national economy can be supplied domestically.

According to materials provided by the State Economic Commission, the proportion of machinery and equipment needed in China this year that is supplied domestically has increased from about 50% in 1952 to about 60%. For the equipment needed for the 156 key projects designed with Soviet assistance, about half can also be supplied domestically this year. In contrast, the machinery and equipment needed for key projects built in the early stages of the First Five-Year Plan, such as the seamless steel tube plant and large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel, the Fuxin Haizhou open-pit coal mine, and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, were almost entirely supplied by the Soviet Union. Currently, except for some large-scale and precision equipment, most of the machinery and equipment needed in China can be manufactured domestically. Some machinery and equipment can even be exported.

The degree of self-sufficiency in machinery and equipment in China has increased under conditions of greatly increased domestic demand for machinery and equipment, especially for large-scale and precision equipment. In 1957, the total value of machinery and equipment consumed nationwide is expected to be more than three times higher than in 1952, and dozens of times higher than in 1936, the year with the highest production level before liberation. Due to large-scale industrial capital construction, the demand for large-scale and precision equipment has increased even more. Therefore, the aforementioned percentage of self-sufficiency does not fully reflect the true increase in the degree of self-sufficiency in machinery and equipment.

Steelmaking Equipment 90% Locally Made; Most Drilling Rigs Can Be Self-Supplied

Before liberation, the machinery and equipment needed by China's machine, metallurgy, coal, petroleum, electric power, chemical, and other heavy industry sectors had to be mostly or entirely imported. Now, China can produce more than 200 types of new machine tools that could not be produced before liberation. About 80% of the machine tools needed by various departments across the country can already be supplied domestically. In terms of metallurgical industry equipment, except for rolling equipment, which still needs to be imported in large quantities, the self-sufficiency rate of ironmaking equipment has reached 77%, and the self-sufficiency rate of steelmaking equipment has reached about 90%. In terms of the coal industry, equipment for mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons can be manufactured domestically, except for individual equipment. Mine hoists, which were heavily imported before liberation, now have a self-sufficiency rate of 88%. In terms of power equipment, except for large-scale thermal power generating equipment, most of the hydroelectric power generating equipment, electric motors, transformers, and switch control equipment can be supplied domestically. The proportion of domestically supplied machinery and equipment needed by the petroleum, chemical, and other industrial sectors has also greatly increased in recent years. However, the urgently needed nitrogen fertilizer equipment has not yet been resolved.

China can now meet 74% of the domestic demand for geological drilling rigs needed for geological exploration this year. Currently, drilling rigs with drilling depths of up to 1,000 meters can be produced domestically. Before liberation, China had never independently produced a single drilling rig. Textile Machinery Can Now Be Supplied Abroad; Heavy-Duty Trucks No Longer Need to Be Imported

In terms of light industry, textile machinery could be fully supplied domestically as early as a few years ago, and a portion has also been exported. For papermaking industry equipment, China can meet more than 60% of the demand this year. Papermaking machines with a daily output of 50 tons have now been successfully trial-produced. Sewing machines, bicycles, winemaking and sugar-making equipment, which were heavily imported before liberation, are now entirely supplied domestically.

China's self-made steam locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars have basically met the needs of railway transportation. Before liberation, China's railway transportation needed these equipment to be imported from foreign countries. In terms of water transportation, except for ocean-going vessels, inland river vessels can already be self-sufficient. In terms of highway transportation, the import of heavy-duty trucks has been stopped this year, and domestically produced "Liberation" brand trucks have begun to be used in large quantities.

The machinery and equipment needed for agriculture, except for tractors, other machines such as combine harvesters, seeders, threshers, tractor plows, and water pumps can be manufactured.

The continuous improvement in the degree of self-sufficiency in machinery and equipment marks that China's national economy has broken away from the state of almost complete dependence on foreign countries in terms of technical equipment before liberation, and has taken a major step on the road of independence and self-reliance. Before liberation, China not only had to import a large amount of general machinery and equipment, but even some extremely simple metal products such as staplers, screws, and tacks were to a considerable extent supplied by foreign countries. According to data from the State Statistical Bureau, in 1936, about 80% of the machinery and equipment needed nationwide was imported from foreign countries.

Total Output Increased More Than Threefold; 3,000 New Products Developed

The rapid development of the machine manufacturing industry is the main condition for the continuous improvement in the degree of self-sufficiency in machinery and equipment in China. In 1957, China's total output of the machine manufacturing industry is expected to increase by more than three times compared to 1952. From 1953 to 1957, the machine industry successfully trial-produced about 3,000 new products.

Relevant parties believe that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, with the completion or commissioning of factories producing important products such as tractors, large metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, heavy-duty machine tools, precision instruments, oil refining and chemical equipment, and ocean-going vessels, with the full utilization of the potential of existing machine manufacturing enterprises, and with the adoption of other measures, it is fully possible to strive to have the vast majority of machinery and equipment needed nationwide supplied domestically.

### 第一个五年计划的新成就  机器设备自给程度显著提高  第二个五年计划需要的设备绝大部分可由国内供应

    第一个五年计划的新成就
    机器设备自给程度显著提高
    第二个五年计划需要的设备绝大部分可由国内供应
    据新华社29日讯　中国机器设备自给程度不断提高，预计第二个五年计划期间国民经济各部门所需要的机器设备绝大部分都可以由国内供应。
    据国家经济委员会提供的材料，中国今年需要的机器设备由国内供应的比重，已经由1952年的50％左右提高到60％左右。像苏联帮助设计的一百五十六项重点工程所需要的设备，今年国内也可以供应一半左右；而在第一个五年计划初期建设的重点工程，如鞍钢无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、阜新海州露天煤矿、第一汽车制造厂等，所需要的机器设备几乎全部是苏联供应的。现在，中国需要的机器设备除部分大型精密的以外，国内都可以制造。有部分机器设备还可以出口。
    中国机器设备自给程度是在国内机器设备需要量，特别是大型精密设备需要量大大增加的情况下提高的。1957年，预计全国消费的机器设备总值，比1952年增加了两倍以上，比解放以前生产水平最高的1936年增加了几十倍。由于大规模的工业基本建设，其中大型精密设备需要量增加得更多。因此上述自给程度的百分数还不能充分反映机器设备自给程度真正的提高。
    炼钢设备能造90％大部分钻机都可自给
    解放以前，中国机器、冶金、煤炭、石油、电力、化学等重工业部门所需要的机器设备，绝大部分或者全部要靠进口解决。现在，中国已能生产二百多种解放以前不能生产的新式机床，全国各部门需要的机床，有80％左右已经可以由国内供应。冶金工业设备方面，目前除轧钢设备还要大量进口以外，炼铁设备自给程度已达到77％，炼钢设备自给程度已达到90％左右。煤炭工业方面，年产九十万吨的矿井设备，除个别设备外，国内都可以制造。解放以前大量进口的矿井卷扬机，现在自给程度已达到88％。电力设备方面，除大型火力发电设备外，水力发电设备、电动机、变压器和开关控制设备，绝大部分国内都能供应。石油、化学等工业部门所需要的机器设备，国内供应的比重最近几年来也有了很大的提高。但是国内急需的氮肥设备，目前还没有解决。
    中国地质勘探需要的地质钻机，今年国内已能满足需要量74％。目前，钻进深度一千公尺以内的钻机，国内都可以生产。解放以前中国没有独立生产过一台钻机。纺织机器已可供应国外载重卡车不再需要进口
    轻工业方面，纺织机器，早在几年前就可以由国内全部满足需要，而且还出口了一部分。造纸工业设备，国内今年能够满足需要量60％以上，日产五十吨的造纸机，现在已经试制成功。解放前大量进口的缝纫机、自行车、制酒和制糖设备，现在已由国内全部供应。
    中国自制的蒸汽机车、货车、客车，已经基本上满足铁路运输的需要。解放以前，中国铁路运输需要的这些设备都要靠从外国进口。水上运输方面，除远洋船舶外，内河船舶已经能够自给。公路运输方面，今年已经停止载重卡车的进口，而开始大量使用国产解放牌汽车。
    农业方面所需要的机器设备，除拖拉机以外，其他机器如联合收割机、播种机、脱粒机、拖拉犁、抽水机等，都可以制造。
    机器设备自给程度不断提高，标志着中国国民经济在技术装备方面已经摆脱了解放以前那种几乎完全依赖外国的状态，而在独立自主的道路上迈进了一大步。解放以前，中国不但一般的机器设备要大量进口，甚至像钉书器、螺钉、洋钉这样一些极简单的金属制品，有相当一部分也要靠国外供应。据国家统计局资料，1936年，全国需要的机器设备80％左右是从国外进口的。
    总产量增长三倍多  新产品制成三千种
    机器制造工业的飞跃发展，是中国机器设备自给程度不断提高的主要条件。1957年，中国机器制造工业总产量预计比1952年增加了三倍以上。从1953年到1957年，机器工业试制成功的新品种共达三千种左右。
    有关方面认为，在第二个五年计划期间，随着像生产拖拉机、大型冶金设备、发电设备、重型机床、精密仪表、炼油化工设备、远洋船舶等这样重要产品的工厂的建成或投入生产，随着原有机器制造企业充分发挥潜力，以及采取其他一些措施，争取全国需要的机器设备绝大部分由国内供应，是有充分可能的。
