    Soviet Kamchatka is Rich in Resources
    Many Valuable Mineral Deposits Recently Discovered
    (Our newspaper's Moscow dispatch, 30th) Kamchatka's resources are under study by Soviet scientists. A scientific conference is currently being held in Petropavlovsk. Among the many reports, aquatic and mineral resources are receiving the most attention. Kamchatka is a rich aquatic region in the Pacific Ocean. Currently, 2.2 million metric tons of fish and crab are caught annually, and this can be increased by one or two times in the next few years. In recent years, many valuable mineral deposits have been found in Kamchatka, and geological structures containing mercury, antimony, molybdenum, copper, gold, coal, and petroleum have been discovered. There are also sulfur and building materials. The underground hot springs in Kamchatka are very valuable and can be converted into high-pressure steam. The western coast of Kamchatka is rich in peat, with reserves accounting for approximately one-tenth of the total reserves in the Soviet Union, which can be used as fuel for electricity and fertilizer for agriculture.
