    Field Songs
    Gong Zhizang
    Socialism is a Big Topic
    If mountain songs aren't sung, flowers won't be fragrant; if mountain songs aren't sung about personal matters,
    Socialism is a big topic, let's sing and talk about the great debate.
    The Cooperative's Dividend Distribution is Lively
    The cooperative's dividend distribution is lively, the girls all have floral skirts,
    The Young Pioneers jump and bounce, the old folks clap their calloused hands.
    The Cooperative is a Jar, the Home is a Bowl
    The cooperative is a jar, the home is a bowl, the water in the jar can't leak,
    Only then can the water in the bowl be full, loving the cooperative is only natural.
    Who is Drilling Holes, Landlords or Rich Peasants?
    The cooperative is a big ferry, socialism is on the other shore,
    Who is drilling holes, landlords or rich peasants? The peasants grab them as if pinching worms.
    The Unified Purchase and Sales Measures are Good
    The unified purchase and sales measures are good, the profiteers say it is a sharp knife,
    The peasants say it is a magic weapon, we don't have to fear empty bellies in famine years.
    Every Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate
    Capitalism is a stinking ditch, fish and shrimp can't live and it smells rotten,
    Socialism is a great river, every carp jumps over the Dragon Gate.
    Dividing Grain, Dividing Firewood, and Dividing Money
    Thinking of the past, we cry with tears streaming down our faces, there weren't even three spoons of rice in the jar;
    Looking at today, we smile contentedly, dividing grain, dividing firewood, and dividing money.

    田头山歌

    社会主义大题目
    山歌不唱花朵香，　山歌不唱私情事，
    社会主义大题目，　唱唱谈谈大辩论。
    社里分红闹盈盈
    社里分红闹盈盈，　姑娘条条花裙裙，
    跳跳蹦蹦红领巾，　拍痛手心老乡亲。
    社是缸，家是碗
    社是缸，家是碗，　缸里的水不能漏，
    碗里的水才能满，　爱护社，理当然。
    地主富农谁凿洞？
    合作社是大渡船，　社会主义在对岸，
    地主富农谁凿洞，　农民抓住如捏虫。
    统购统销措施好
    统购统销措施好，　奸商说它是尖刀，
    农民说它是法宝，　荒年不怕肚不饱。
    条条鲤鱼跳龙门
    资本主义臭死沟，　鱼虾不活发腥臭，
    社会主义大江河，　条条鲤鱼跳龙门。
    分谷分柴又分钱
    想想过去哭涟涟，　缸中没有三盅米；
    看看今朝笑眯眯，　分谷分柴又分钱。
