South-Central Industrial Design Institute strikes down the rightists' arrogance, completing tasks ahead of schedule in July and August
Hegang Coal Mine adopts mass opinions to improve work, exceeding August plan

(Our newspaper Wuhan, 10th dispatch) As the anti-Rightist struggle deepens, the South-Central Industrial Construction Design Institute's production situation is getting better and better. In July, the monetary workload completed 123% of the plan, and all physical indicators were completed ahead of schedule. Design quality and savings achievements are also very good. In August, while ensuring the quality of drawings, measures to lower standards were fully implemented. For the six projects designed in August alone, 160,000 square meters of land, over 13,000 square meters of construction area, and over 58,000 cubic meters of building volume were saved.

In May and June, the Rightists in this institute openly clamored for "old cadres to step aside," undermining some effective production management systems. When formulating plans and evaluating quality, the Rightists demanded unlimited relaxation of standards and reduced requirements, and labor discipline was unprecedentedly ruined. Therefore, although the plans for May and June were conservatively set, they were not all completed.

In the anti-Rightist struggle, after the masses struck down the arrogance of these Rightists, the strength of the leftists in technical leadership rose, and the Party's policies and guidelines could be better implemented. During the design of a sliding track project for a yarn factory, the designers actively went to the site to conduct investigations and suggested that the factory and a dyeing factory jointly build a sliding track, resulting in savings of over 80,000 yuan and over 15 tons of steel.

(Our newspaper Hegang, 10th dispatch) Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: Since mid-July, Hegang Coal Mine has closely grasped the principle of seizing the improvement of work in the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, earnestly studied and adopted the correct opinions put forward by the masses, and actively improved work.

In the past, Hegang Mining Area had not formulated a long-term plan, and the layout of industrial construction was not rational enough, with some buildings being demolished after they were built. Now, Hegang City has established a Mining Area Overall Planning Committee to be responsible for mining area construction planning matters. The Mining Bureau has also implemented regular cyclical operations in six mines and fourteen mining sites, based on the opinions put forward by the masses, and began to reverse the situation of slow coal extraction speed and declining cyclical operation level. In August, the state's raw coal production plan was completed two days ahead of schedule and exceeded by more than 4,000 tons.

Leading cadres of the Mining Bureau and its subordinate mines have gone deep into construction sites, workshops, mine entrances, employee dormitories, and canteens to understand the difficulties of employees in their work and life and to solve them quickly. Hegang Coal Mine has developed rapidly in recent years, with a large increase in employees, and housing cannot meet the needs, generating many complaints from the masses. Now, Hegang Mining Bureau has decided to mainly adopt the method of self-construction with public assistance to solve the problem.

　　反击右派越深入  生产改进越显著
　　中南工业设计院打下右派气焰，七八月份提前完成任务
　　鹤岗煤矿采纳群众意见改进工作，八月份计划超额完成
    本报武汉10日电　中南工业建筑设计院随着反右派斗争的日益深入，生产状况越来越好。7月份，货币工作量完成计划123％，实物指标全部提前完成。设计质量和节约成绩也很好。8月份在保证图纸质量的情况下，全面贯彻了降低标准的措施。仅8月份设计的六项工程，就节约用地十六万平方公尺、建筑面积一万三千多平方公尺、建筑体积五万八千多立方公尺。
    在5、6月份，这个院的右派分子公开叫嚣“老干部让开”，破坏对生产管理上一些行之有效的制度。在编制计划和评定质量的时候，右派分子要求无限度地放宽尺度，降低要求，劳动纪律空前败坏。因此，5、6月份的计划虽然订得保守，但是也没有全部完成。
    在反右派斗争中，这些右派分子的气焰被群众打下去以后，在技术领导上左派的力量抬了头，党的政策方针能够更好地贯彻执行。在某纱厂滑道工程的设计过程中，设计人员积极到现场进行调查，建议这个厂和印染厂合建一条滑道，结果节省了八万多元和十五吨以上的钢材。（长江日报编辑部）
    本报鹤岗10日电　记者康伟中报道：7月中旬以来，鹤岗煤矿紧紧掌握了在整风和反右派斗争中要抓紧改进工作的原则，认真研究和采纳群众提出的正确意见，积极改进工作。
    过去，鹤岗矿区没有制定远景规划，工业建设的布置不够合理，有的建筑建成了又要拆掉。现在鹤岗市已经成立了矿区总体规划委员会，负责矿区建设规划事宜。矿务局还根据群众提出的意见，在六个矿十四个采掘场推行了正规循环作业，开始扭转了回采速度慢和循环作业水平下降的局面，8月份就提前二天并超额四千多吨完成了国家原煤生产计划。
    矿务局以及所属各矿的领导干部已深入工地、车间、坑口、职工宿舍和食堂，了解职工群众在工作上、生活上的困难，迅速解决。鹤岗煤矿近几年发展快，职工增加得多，房子不能满足需要，群众意见很多。现在，鹤岗矿务局已经决定主要采取自建公助的办法来解决。
