　　The So-Called "Reversal Philosophy"
　　Huang Zhi
    Pan Shisheng, the Deputy Director of the Supervision Office of Shanxi Province, a Communist Party member in name only, trumpets a kind of "reversal philosophy." The essence of this "philosophy" is: "If you say it's good, I say it's not good; if you think it's a good thing, I think it's a bad thing; if the leaders think he's a good cadre, I think he's a bad cadre."
    What is the basis for Pan Shisheng's creation of this set of "philosophy"? It turns out that he has a "unique insight" into our society, believing that our society "has no right or wrong" and "no code of conduct." He said: "Shoes have their style, boots have their style, but things have no standard." "If you make a Bodhisattva out of a piece of loess, someone will burn incense and kowtow to it; if you throw it in the toilet, someone will wipe their butt with it." So he went on to assert that in our society, "whoever has the greatest power is the truth." He even lamented, "In the past, there was might without right, now there is right because of might." Thus, in the great blooming and contending, he launched vicious attacks on the Party and the leaders.
    Originally, people standing on different positions have different views on good and bad, good and evil, right and wrong. Pan Shisheng's spreading "reversal philosophy" and saying the opposite is a concrete manifestation of his reactionary stance. His attacking "might," confusing truth, is essentially attacking our country's people's democratic dictatorship system and the leadership of the Communist Party. Seeing that the people's democratic dictatorship system is being consolidated day by day and the Party's prestige among the people is growing day by day, he is worried, trying to use people's dissatisfaction with the past rule of the exploiting classes to blur people's vision of the Communist Party and the socialist political system, to pull away the masses united around the Party, to isolate the Party, and to overthrow socialism. However, Pan Shisheng is wasting his efforts. Because the masses of the people, according to the logic of their own lives, know what is might and what is truth; they know: "Whoever relies on the truth has infinite power."
    Pan Shisheng's "reversal philosophy" is a blatant anti-communist "philosophy," which clearly reflects what this rightist loves and what he hates. But it is not limited to this. His set of "philosophy" is precisely a summary of the anti-communist and anti-people words and deeds of the rightists revealed during this period. Because no matter how many tricks the rightists play and how many methods they use to deceive, they are nothing more than "you (referring to the people) think it's a good thing, I (the rightists) think it's a bad thing," thereby painstakingly trying to turn history back.

### 所谓“反盘哲学”

　　所谓“反盘哲学”
　　黄植
    山西省监察厅办公室副主任、挂着共产党员招牌的潘实生鼓吹一种“反盘哲学”。这种“哲学”的要义就是：“你们说好，我就说不好；你们认为是好事，我就认为是坏事；领导认为是好干部，我就认为是坏干部。”
    潘实生创造这套“哲学”的根据是什么？原来是他对我们这个社会的看法“独具慧眼”，他认为我们这个社会“没有是非”，“没有生活准则”。他说：“鞋有样，靴有样，就是事情没有样。”“一块黄土捏成个菩萨就有人给烧香磕头，扔在厕所里就有人擦屁股”。于是他进而一口咬定，在我们这个社会里，“谁的力量大，谁就是真理”。他甚而感慨地说“过去是有强权无公理，现在是有强权就有公理”。于是，在大鸣大放中，他就对党，对领导进行恶毒的攻击。
    本来站在不同立场的人，对好坏、善恶、是非，自有不同的看法。潘实生在这里散布“反盘哲学”，说反话，正是他所站的反动立场的具体表现。他攻击“强权”，混淆真理，实质上正是在攻击我国人民民主专政制度和共产党的领导。他看到人民民主专政制度在日益巩固和党在人民群众中间威信在日益增长，便忧心忡忡，企图利用人们对过去剥削阶级统治人民的不满，来模糊人们对于共产党和社会主义政治制度的视听，把团结在党周围的群众拉开，使党陷于孤立，使社会主义垮台。但是，潘实生不过白费心思。因为人民群众按照自己生活的逻辑，知道什么是强权，什么是真理；知道：“谁依靠着真理，谁就力量无穷”。
    潘实生的“反盘哲学”是一套露骨的反共“哲学”，它明白地反映出这个右派分子爱的是什么，恨的又是什么。但也不仅限于此，他这一套“哲学”又正是这一时期所揭露出来的右派分子反共反人民言行的总结。因为不管右派分子耍了多少花招，使了多少遮眼之法，都无非是“你们（指人民）认为是好事，我（右派）就认为是坏事”，从而处心积虑，企图把历史倒转过来。
