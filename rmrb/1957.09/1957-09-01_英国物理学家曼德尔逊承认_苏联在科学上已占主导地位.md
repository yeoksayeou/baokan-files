Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from London: British physicist Mendelssohn recently wrote in the "Observer" that the Soviet Union has now taken a leading position in science. The average Soviet scientist has more technicians than their counterparts in Britain or the United States.

    Mendelssohn said that the Soviet Union has achieved some "very substantial" technical achievements. He cited the progress of the Soviet jet airliner, the construction of the first giant nuclear-powered icebreaker, and the "world's largest" accelerator for bombarding atomic nuclei, which was recently put into operation.

    Speaking of guaranteeing working conditions for scientists, Mendelssohn wrote that in the Soviet Union, "people expect scientists to think well for science, and scientists do not have to spend time seeking the means necessary to realize their claims; administrative staff and accountants can do this for them. Well-organized technical service personnel take care of supplying and maintaining equipment, so scientists do not have to worry about it."

    Mendelssohn emphasized that Soviet scientists are treated very well. A good physicist in the United States earns only five times the wage of an unskilled worker, and in Britain only seven times, while a good physicist in the Soviet Union earns about twenty-five times the wage of an unskilled worker. He also pointed out that, thanks to these guarantees, Soviet scientists can concentrate on scientific work.

    Speaking of the training of scientific staff, Mendelssohn wrote: "What impressed us most was the abundant equipment in the science laboratories of the universities, where they can freely conduct experiments with many valuable and complex scientific research instruments, such as electron microscopes and precision spectrographs. Moscow produces 500 physicists a year, while Oxford in Britain produces only 70. This means that the number of students studying physics in Moscow is twelve times that of Oxford. Among the professors and teachers in Moscow, there are 70 physics professors and teachers, while Oxford has only five."

    Mendelssohn wrote that, clearly, the Soviet Union spends much more on science than any other country in the world.

    英国物理学家曼德尔逊承认
    苏联在科学上已占主导地位
    新华社30日讯  伦敦消息：英国物理学家曼德尔逊最近在“观察家报”著文说，目前苏联在科学方面已经占了主导的地位。苏联平均每一个科学家所拥有的技术员要比英国或者美国多。
    曼德尔逊说，苏联获得了一些“非常实在”的技术成就。他举出了苏联喷气式客机、在制造第一艘巨型原子发动机破冰船方面的进步，以及不久以前投入运转的轰击原子核用的“世界上最大的”加速器。
    在谈到保证科学家的工作条件时，曼德尔逊写道，在苏联，“人们希望科学家能够很好地为科学而思考，科学家不必为寻求实现他的主张所必需的手段而花费时间；行政工作人员和会计人员就可以为他们做到这一点。有组织得很好的技术服务人员去关心供应和维护装备，科学家不必为此操劳。
    曼德尔逊着重指出，苏联科学家的待遇很好。美国一个好的物理学家挣的工资只为不熟练工人的五倍，英国只为七倍，而苏联一个好的物理学家挣的工资约为不熟练工人的二十五倍。他还指出，由于有了这些保证，苏联科学家就能专心致力于科学工作。
    曼德尔逊在谈到培养科学工作人员的问题时写道：“给我们留下最深的印象的是大学生科学实验室里的充实设备，他们可以在这些实验室里用许多贵重和复杂的科学研究仪器，如电子显微镜和精确摄谱仪等自由从事实验。莫斯科一年造就出五百个物理学家，而英国的牛津只能造就出七十名。这就是说，莫斯科学习物理的学生人数为牛津的十二倍。在莫斯科的教授——教师队伍中，有七十名是物理学教授和教师，而牛津却只有五名。”
    曼德尔逊写道，显然，苏联花在科学方面的费用比世界上其它任何国家都要多得多。
