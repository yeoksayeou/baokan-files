Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th: The Henan Province's theatrical circles have held meetings in recent days to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Henan Opera actress and rightist Chen Suzhen.

Chen Suzhen is a representative of the Henan Provincial People's Congress and vice chairman of the Henan branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association. A large number of exposed facts show that this actress, once touted as the "Queen of Henan Opera," played a despicable villain in the ugly drama staged by rightists across the country a few months ago, who frantically attacked the Communist Party and socialism.

A telegram from the Chinese Dramatists Association revealed that Chen Suzhen had recently openly said to a female staff member of the Drama Gazette: "The Communist Party will not lead for long, because it has lost popular support." When Chen Suzhen was in Beijing, she visited rightist Wu Zuguang several times. Even after Wu Zuguang's reactionary views were criticized, she expressed her agreement and support for all of Wu's views. What was particularly egregious was that Chen Suzhen was living in the home of Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and she secretly sent someone to inform Wu of the situation she had heard.

When Chen Suzhen spread fallacies such as "the Communist Party has lost popular support" to others, she always cited a so-called "rural survey" she had conducted as a basis. In recent meetings, her so-called "survey" trick was also exposed.

It turns out that in May of this year, Chen Suzhen stayed at the Chenguang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanbeidian Village, Kaifeng County, for less than three hours, only talked to a reactionary rich peasant who had been detained by the government for speculating in grain and another wealthy middle peasant, but fabricated a so-called "rural survey" of thousands of words. In Chen Suzhen's writing, she described the lives of peasants as extremely miserable, and said that the countryside had become "a world of party members, a world of Communist Youth League members," and "Party and League members, big and small, are all officials, how can officials still work?" Chen Suzhen also said that although these "officials" "do not work," they still share the fruits of the peasants' labor, so they "do little work at home and get a large share," becoming a "major contradiction" in the countryside.

Wang Zixian, a representative of the Chenguang Agricultural Cooperative in Kaifeng County, spoke on behalf of more than 1,000 members of the cooperative at the meeting and reasoned with Chen Suzhen. Wang Zixian said, "When Chen Suzhen came to our cooperative, more than half of the members of our cooperative were still eating the surplus grain from last year. What is the basis for her saying we are in 'three elm (yu) and one chicken (ji) (famine)'?" Wang Zixian said, "I am the director of supervision in the cooperative, a Communist Party member. Although there are many things to do, I still participate in labor. This year, during the wheat harvest, I earned more than 300 work points by myself."

Du Deqiu, head of the Henan Provincial Henan Opera Troupe, exposed at the meeting that after Chen Suzhen came to the Henan Provincial Henan Opera Troupe, she developed members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and established a branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, with Chen Suzhen serving as the head of the branch. She once triumphantly clamored: "The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang branch in the Henan Provincial Henan Opera Troupe is the failure of the Communist Party!" "Everything in the troupe cannot be done in the future without going through the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang!" This is not just "rivaling," it is clearly "replacing it," usurping the Party's leadership over the troupe!

Famous Henan Opera actors Cui Lantian, Ma Jinfeng, Xu Fengyun, and others revealed at the meeting that from the time she began performing on stage until the time of liberation, for fourteen years, she lived the life of a "wealthy wife" of Kuomintang pseudo-officials and senior military officers for eleven years; for a considerable period of time, she completely left the stage and became an "official's wife."

In the face of so many ironclad facts, Chen Suzhen had to admit that she was a "sinner of the people" and admitted that the rural survey she wrote was "fabrication and slander."

　　“豫剧大王”原来是个右派角色
　　陈素真捏造事实诬蔑新社会
    据新华社郑州16日电　河南省戏剧界连日来举行集会，揭露和批驳豫剧演员、右派分子陈素真的反动言行。
    陈素真是河南省人民代表大会代表、中国戏剧家协会河南省分会副主席。揭露的大量事实表明，这个曾被吹嘘是“豫剧大王”的女演员，在几个月以前全国各地右派分子合演的向共产党、向社会主义猖狂进攻的丑剧里，却扮演了一个可耻的反派角色。
    中国戏剧家协会来电揭露陈素真不久前曾公然对戏剧报的一个女工作人员说：“共产党领导不长了，因为不得人心。”陈素真在北京时，曾几次拜访右派分子吴祖光。就在吴祖光的反动论点受到批判以后，她还向吴表示赞同和支持吴的全部论点。特别恶劣的是，陈素真当时就住在中国戏剧家协会主席田汉家里，她竟将听到的有关情况，暗地派人给吴通风报信。
    陈素真向别人散播“共产党不得人心”等谬论的时候，总要举出她作的一次所谓“农村调查”作根据。在最近几次会议上，她的这个所谓“调查”的鬼把戏也被人戳穿了。
    原来今年5月间，陈素真到了开封县南北店村晨光农业社停留了还不足三个小时，只找过一个曾因倒卖粮食被政府扣押过的反动富农和另一个富裕中农，却捏造出一篇洋洋几千言的所谓“农村调查”来。在陈素真的笔下，把农民生活说得苦不堪言，还说农村成了“党员的世界、团员的天下”，“党团员大小都是官，是官还能劳动吗？”陈素真并说这些“官”虽然“不劳动”，却照样分享农民劳动成果，因此“做家少，分家多”，成了农村中一个“主要矛盾”。
    开封县晨光农业社的代表王子贤，代表全社一千多社员在会上和陈素真说理。王子贤说，就在陈素真到我们社里去的时候，我们全社有半数以上的社员家里吃的还都是去年的余粮，她说我们“三鱼（榆）一鸡（饥）”有什么根据？王子贤说，我是社里的监察主任，是个共产党员。事情虽然很多，可是我照样参加劳动，今年麦忙时我一个人就做了三百多个工分。
    河北省豫剧团团长杜德秋在会上揭发了陈素真到河北省豫剧团以后发展民革成员，成立了民革支部，陈素真担任支部负责人。曾得意忘形地叫嚣：“民革支部在河北省豫剧团的成立，就是共产党的失败！”“剧团里的一切事情，今后不通过民革就不能办！”这已经不是什么“分庭抗礼”了，明明是在“取而代之”，篡夺党对剧团的领导权！
    豫剧著名演员崔兰田、马金凤、徐凤云等，在会上揭发从她开始登台演戏起到解放时止的十四年当中，有十一年的时间过着国民党伪官员、高级军官的“阔太太”生活；其中有相当长的时间，她完全脱离了舞台，当起“官太太”了。
    在这样许多铁的事实面前，陈素真不得不承认自己是“人民的罪人”，承认所写的农村调查是“造谣污蔑”。
