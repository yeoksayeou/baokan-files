The grain issue is the focal point of the current struggle between socialist and capitalist ideologies in rural areas. Resolutely safeguarding the Party's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and overcoming the "grain disturbance" trend instigated by prosperous middle peasants, has become the key to consolidating the socialist阵地 [zhèn dì - battle position, front] in rural areas and the agricultural cooperative system. The case of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Sujiabao, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, in launching a great debate on the grain issue, fully illustrates this point.

The "Grain Disturbance" Trend

During the grain unified purchase and sale work last winter, four management committee members of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative, led by Liu Tingfu, who were prosperous middle peasants, advocated concealing more than 50,000 jin of grain and reducing the unified purchase task. However, some cadres, led by cooperative director Liu Yujie, firmly opposed this erroneous proposition, reported the actual output to the state, and accepted the state's grain purchase task of more than 219,000 jin. As a result, those cadres who advocated concealing output, on the one hand, repeatedly obstructed the completion of the grain purchase task within the cooperative, and on the other hand, spread discontented remarks to some people with serious capitalist ideas and backward masses. As a result, cooperative director Liu Yujie was isolated. At that time, they threatened: "Let him (referring to Liu Yujie) complete the purchase task! Once the new year is over, everyone will 'stir up grain troubles,'" and planned the steps of "small disturbances in March, big disturbances in April, and disturbances in the whole cooperative in May." When the spring plowing began this year, the "grain disturbance" trend appeared. Cooperative members cursed everywhere: "380 jin is not enough to eat. Liu Yujie, the cooperative director of Sujiabao, only cares about the state and doesn't care about the life and death of cooperative members." Every day, groups of people went to his house to demand supplies, and some people often threw stones at his house, making it a chaotic mess, and righteousness could not prevail. Cooperative members were not active in labor. When the team leader assigned tasks to cooperative members, some people said: "Bring the grain first." The preparations for spring plowing were not done well, which greatly affected this year's production. Until the summer, the state supplied more than 3,800 jin of grain, and the "grain disturbance" trend subsided slightly. However, because cooperative director Liu Yujie exposed the mistake of Liu Tingfu and others in concealing 8,000 jin of wheat during the summer harvest, and resolutely completed the state's wheat purchase task, he angered people with serious capitalist ideas again, and they were brewing a new "grain disturbance" trend.

Is it a Real Grain Shortage or a False Grain Shortage?

At this time, a work team from the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department came to Sujiabao. As soon as the work team entered the village, it was besieged by the "grain disturbance." The cadres and masses who led the "grain disturbance" all shouted that there was not enough grain to eat, and many people said: "If it weren't for the old grain saved from individual farming, we would have starved to death relying on the advanced cooperative." So, was there enough grain to eat, and did the farmers' grain consumption increase or decrease after the advanced cooperativization? The work team and the Party branch in the cooperative investigated and surveyed this issue. As a result, the facts were the opposite. Farmers' grain consumption increased after advanced cooperativization, not decreased; farmers not only had enough grain to eat but also had a surplus. Before cooperativization in 1955 (individual farmers accounted for 87%), the whole village produced a total of 805,968 jin of grain. After deducting various deductions, the masses actually retained 494,334 jin of grain, averaging 427 jin of grain per person. In 1956, a total of 808,694 jin of grain were produced (expanding cotton fields by 750 mu). After deducting various deductions, cooperative members retained a total of 527,098 jin of grain, averaging 447 jin per person; the state supplied 3,880 jin, averaging 450.8 jin of grain actually retained per person. In 1956, the whole village retained an average of 23 jin more per person than in 1955, an increase of 5.5%. Not only did the quantity of retained grain increase, but the quality also greatly improved. In 1955, the whole village ate an average of 42 jin of wheat per person, which increased to 115 jin in 1956. This year, due to the reduction in wheat production, an average of 81 jin of wheat was eaten per person, which was slightly less than last year, but still 92.8% higher than before cooperativization. Was the task of selling to the state too much? No. In 1955, the whole village completed a total of 259,667 jin of grain purchase tasks, and in 1956, a total of 219,879 jin were completed. Compared with 1955, grain production increased by 2,726 jin in 1956, but the purchase task was reduced by 39,788 jin.

Who is Really "Stirring up Grain Troubles?"

After ascertaining the above situation, the Party branch and the work team affirmed that the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative was not really short of grain, but rather "ideologically short of grain." Therefore, they first studied the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Conducting Large-Scale Socialist Education Among the Entire Rural Population," and the "Instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee on Conducting a Struggle Against Concealing Output and Deceiving the State in Rural Areas" within the Party and Communist Youth League branches. After studying, everyone opened their eyes, established the courage to fight against the "grain disturbance" trend, and initially exposed many facts of fake grain shortages. However, when they started to solve this problem in the management committee and among the masses, they encountered strong resistance from prosperous middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas. Management Committee member Zhang Zhizhi affirmed: "The farmers' grain consumption is now higher than in the era of the Yan Xishan warlord, but lower than before the War of Resistance Against Japan; grain consumption after advanced cooperativization is also lower than before advanced cooperativization." Some prosperous middle peasants took the opportunity to deny the superiority of the advanced cooperative, saying: "The advanced cooperative is getting worse every year."

In order to break through the encirclement of the capitalist ideas of prosperous middle peasants, the Party branch and the work team studied and decided that it was necessary to first mobilize poor and lower-middle peasants to distinguish between right and wrong, and rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to fight against capitalist ideas. Therefore, they first organized debates among poor and lower-middle peasants and conducted accounting on a household-by-household basis. As a result, the facts again overturned the fallacies of some prosperous middle peasants. Among the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants of the new middle peasants in the whole cooperative, 85% of the households had increased their retained grain compared to before advanced cooperativization. For example, Qiu Kui recalled that after the land reform, he was allocated nine mu of land. After deducting expenses from his annual grain income, he could only eat an average of 257 jin of grain per person, and he relied on selling labor to make up for the shortfall. Ren Gensheng had two mu of land before the land reform, and the grain income per person per year was less than 200 jin. He relied entirely on mixing vegetables to eat. After the land reform, he was allocated twelve mu of land, but the average grain consumption per person per year did not exceed 300 jin. In general, before cooperativization, the average grain consumption per person per year for poor and lower-middle peasants was generally below 380 jin. Only 10% of poor and lower-middle peasants had no increase or decrease in retained grain compared to before advanced cooperativization, and only 5% had a decrease in retained grain. 35% of old lower-middle peasants had an increase in retained grain compared to before advanced cooperativization, 45% had no increase or decrease, and 20% had a decrease in retained grain. 30% of new and old upper-middle peasants had no increase or decrease in retained grain, and 70% had a decrease in retained grain. 50% of the former landlords and rich peasants' households had no increase or decrease in retained grain, and 50% had a slight decrease in retained grain. In total, 51.8% of the households in the whole cooperative had an increase in retained grain, 25.2% had no increase or decrease, and 23% had a decrease in retained grain. After such accounting, the poor and lower-middle peasants suddenly realized: "Originally, we were calling for a grain shortage by blindly following the prosperous middle peasants and the former landlord and rich peasant elements." Everyone then revealed that "in the past, upper-middle peasants had livestock and earned two dou and a half of grain for plowing one mu of land for us"; some upper-middle peasants produced a lot of grain before cooperativization, but sold less grain, and had always resisted the unified purchase and sale of grain; although some farmers had less retained grain than before cooperativization, their retained grain was still enough to eat.

After this accounting clarified the fallacies on the grain issue. However, some prosperous middle peasants still said: "There is indeed not enough retained grain in the cooperative," and did not admit that the grain supply disturbances this spring were fake grain shortages. So, was it enough to eat or not? The Party branch and the work team again conducted a ranking of the grain situation of the supply households among the masses. This year, 94 households (314 people) in the whole cooperative ate 3,880 jin of supply grain, averaging 13 jin per person, and some cooperative members only averaged more than 3 jin of grain per person. Looking at the amount of grain distributed last year by the 94 supply households: 81 households received an average of 400 to 600 jin of grain per person last year, and 13 households received 380 to 400 jin. Among the households with more than 450 jin of distributed grain, the most "grain disturbances" occurred, accounting for 45% of these households, while among the households with 380 to 400 jin of distributed grain, only 30% had "grain disturbances." According to the actual grain shortage situation, among the 94 supply households, only one household did not have enough retained grain due to marrying a wife and bringing three people, 33 households originally had enough retained grain but actually lacked grain due to wasting grain, and the remaining 60 households were fake grain shortages.

After clearing up these two accounts, the minds of the cadres and cooperative members became clear. Everyone realized that "those with less grain are not making trouble, those with more grain are making trouble," and that it is "the upper-middle peasants and landlord and rich peasant elements who made a fortune by speculating on grain in the past who are making trouble."

Who Benefits from Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain, Who Supports it, and Who Opposes it?

After clarifying the lines between right and wrong on the grain issue among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasant cooperative members, a general meeting of all cooperative members was held. The work team made a report based on the grain unified purchase and sale policy, the grain situation in the cooperative, and the group debates of the past few days, focusing on criticizing the capitalist ideas of the prosperous middle peasants. After the meeting, the masses' minds became clearer, and those with serious capitalist ideas who had led the "grain disturbances" were isolated. But they were still not convinced. They said: "Our area is a grain-producing area, and farmers should have more grain to eat," and even said: "Unified purchase and sale of grain is beneficial to the whole country, but detrimental to Sujiabao," questioning "Sujiabao used to have a lot of grain, where did it go now?" Therefore, another debate on the unified purchase and sale policy was organized.

The first topic of the debate was whether unified purchase and sale of grain was beneficial to individuals. Some people proposed: "In the past, without unified purchase and sale of grain, we could buy grain at will, but now we can't buy grain even if we have money." Everyone debated: "In the past, being able to buy grain meant that poor people were exploited, but now there is no grain speculation and prices are stable, which is still good for farmers." For example, the grain merchant Liu Huizhang used to be able to earn a mule in one afternoon by selling grain, and the poor peasant Li Chunjin ate five dou of sorghum from others a year before joining the cooperative and then repaid five dou of wheat after the wheat harvest. Therefore, everyone said: "Not implementing unified purchase and sale of grain is good for prosperous middle peasants and grain speculators, and implementing unified purchase and sale of grain is good for farmers who lack grain." Then, some upright prosperous middle peasants corrected this statement, saying: "Unified purchase and sale of grain is not bad for upper-middle peasants either. In the past, when we carried grain into the city, grain dealers used 'three tricks' (reducing the weight, changing the measure, and taking small change) and 'one squeeze' (using a large scale), which was both time-consuming and costly. Now we sell the grain to the state at once without losing a penny. It seems that unified purchase and sale of grain is only detrimental to those who make a fortune by speculating on grain. Therefore, we support it, and they oppose it."

The second topic was: Where did the grain go? The prosperous middle peasant Zhang Zizhi proposed: "In the past, there were many households with grain reserves in the village, but now everyone can barely make ends meet." Liu Yuyin retorted: "We can't just look at the grain, we also have to look at the population, which has also increased. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 700 people in our village, now there are 1,178 people. Besides, in the past, only landlords and rich peasants had a lot of grain, but now everyone is prosperous." Everyone also said: "Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, grain was not transported for thousands of miles, and grass was not transported for hundreds of miles. There was not enough to eat in places with less grain. Now that unified purchase and sale of grain is implemented, it can be adjusted nationwide." After clarifying these principles, this issue was also resolved.

The third topic was: Is it feasible for the state not to implement unified purchase and sale of grain? Some cooperative members said: "The current grain shortage is due to the state's excessive scale of industrial construction. To allow farmers to eat more grain, except for military factories, all factories should be closed down, saving grain for farmers to improve their lives first, and then the state can carry out construction." Li Shoukui retorted: "This approach is wrong. New factories are being built every day now, but daily necessities are still insufficient. If there are fewer factories, we won't be able to wear pants." Finally, everyone also linked it to supporting disaster areas and supporting the People's Liberation Army, and unanimously agreed that it was necessary, recognizing that "the state's grain shortage is due to our country's prosperity, large population, and large scale of construction, which is a good thing not a bad thing."

After solving these ideological problems, the work team then inspired everyone to discuss that to eat more grain, it is necessary to do a good job in production. In this way, everyone shifted their emotions to production. Someone said: "Let's produce well and ask the land for grain, and stop causing grain disturbances to the state."

    粮食问题上两条道路的斗争
    ——记红星农业社粮食问题大辩论的经过——
    白兴华
    粮食问题是当前农村中社会主义思想和资本主义思想斗争的焦点。坚决地维护党的统购统销政策，克服富裕中农带头掀起的“闹粮”歪风，已经成为巩固农村的社会主义阵地和农业合作制度的关键。山西省平遥县苏家堡红星农业社开展粮食问题大辩论的情况，充分地说明了这个问题。
    “闹粮”的歪风
    去年冬天在进行粮食统购统销工作的时候，红星农业社内有以刘廷富为首的四个富裕中农成份的管理委员，主张把五万余斤粮食隐瞒下来，少交统购任务。而以社主任刘玉杰为首的一部分干部，坚决反对这种错误主张，把实产报告给了国家，接受了国家所给的二十一万九千余斤的粮食征购任务。于是，那些主张隐瞒产量的干部，一方面在社内多次阻挠粮食征购任务的完成，一方面向某些资本主义思想严重的人和落后群众散布不满言论。结果，使社主任刘玉杰陷于孤立。那时，他们扬言：“叫他（指刘玉杰）去完成征购任务吧！一过年大家就‘闹粮’”，并且规划了“3月小闹，4月大闹，5月全社闹”的步骤。今年春耕开始，“闹粮”的风潮就出现了。社员到处叫骂：“三百八不够吃，苏家堡社长刘玉杰，只顾国家不顾社员的死和活”。每天有成群的人到他家要供应，还有人经常给他房上扔石头，真是闹得乌烟瘴气，正气不能抬头。社员劳动不积极，队长给社员分配营生时，有些人说：“先拿粮食来”。春耕准备工作没有做好，大大影响了今年的生产。直至夏季，国家供应了三千八百多斤粮食，“闹粮”之风才稍平息。但由于在夏收中社主任刘玉杰又揭发了刘廷富等隐瞒八千斤小麦的错误，坚决完成了国家所给的小麦征购任务，又触怒了资本主义思想严重的人，他们又在酝酿新的“闹粮”风潮。
        真缺粮还是假缺粮？
    正在这时，省委农村工作部的一个工作组来到了苏家堡。工作组一进村，便陷入“闹粮”的重围之中。带头“闹粮”的干部和群众都嚷粮食不够吃，很多人说：“要不是靠单干时的旧存粮，靠高级社早饿死了”。那么，粮食究竟够吃不够吃，高级合作化以后农民吃粮究竟增加了还是减少了呢？工作组和社内的党支部对这个问题进行了调查摸底。结果，事实相反。高级合作化以后农民的吃粮是增加了，不是减少了；农民的粮食不仅够吃而且有余。1955年合作化以前（单干户占87％），全村共产粮食八十万五千九百六十八斤，除过各种扣除，群众实际留粮四十九万四千三百三十四斤，每人平均留粮四百二十七斤。1956年共产粮八十万八千六百九十四斤（扩大棉田七百五十亩），除过各种扣除，社员共留粮五十二万七千零九十八斤，每人平均四百四十七斤；国家供应三千八百八十斤，每人平均实际留粮四百五十点八斤。全村1956年比1955年每人平均多留二十三斤，即提高5.5％。不仅留粮的数量增加了，而且质量也大大提高了。1955年全村每人平均吃麦四十二斤，1956年增加至一百一十五斤。今年由于小麦减产，每人平均吃八十一斤，比去年虽有减少，但比合作化前还高92.8％。是不是卖给国家的任务过多了呢？也不是。1955年全村共完成粮食征购任务二十五万九千六百六十七斤，1956年共完成二十一万九千八百七十九斤。1956年与1955年比较，粮食增产二千七百二十六斤，征购任务却减少了三万九千七百八十八斤。
        究竟谁在“闹粮”
    摸实以上情况以后，党支部和工作组肯定了红星农业社不是真正缺粮，而是“思想缺粮”。于是，首先在党和共青团的支部内学习了中共中央“关于向全体农村人口进行大规模的社会主义教育的指示”、省委和省人民委员会“关于在农村中进行一次反对隐瞒产量欺骗国家的思想斗争的指示”。经过学习，大家擦亮了眼睛，树立了向“闹粮”的歪风进行斗争的勇气，并且初步揭发了许多假缺粮的事实。但是，着手在管理委员会和群众中解决这个问题的时候，却遇到了资本主义思想严重的富裕中农的强烈反抗。管理委员张志智肯定说：“现在农民吃粮比阎匪统治时代是提高了，比抗日战争前是降低了；高级合作化以后吃粮又比高级合作化前降低了”。有些富裕中农乘机否定高级社的优越性，说：“高级社一年不如一年”。
    为了冲破富裕中农的资本主义思想的包围，党支部和工作组研究，必须首先发动贫农和下中农来分清是非，依靠贫农和下中农来向资本主义思想进行斗争。于是，便首先在贫农和下中农中间组织了辩论，逐户进行了算账。结果，事实又推翻了某些富裕中农的谬论。全社贫农和新中农中间的下中农之中，有85％的户比高级合作化前留粮增加了。比如丘奎信回忆他在土地改革以后分到九亩地，每年的粮食收入除去支出，每人只能平均吃到二百五十七斤粮食，不足部分靠卖短工过活。任根生土改前有二亩地，一年粮食收入每人吃不到二百斤，其余全靠掺菜吃，土改后分到十二亩地，但每人每年平均吃粮也不超过三百斤。总的看来，合作化前贫农和下中农每人每年平均吃粮一般都在三百八十斤以下。贫农和下中农比高级合作化前留粮不增不减的只占10％，留粮减少的只占5％。老下中农比高级合作化前留粮增加的占35％，不增不减的占45％，留粮减少的占20％。新老上中农留粮不增不减的占30％，留粮减少的占70％。过去的地主富农有50％的户留粮不增不减，有50％的户留粮略有减少。总计，全社留粮增加的户占51.8％，不增不减的户占25.2％，留粮减少的户占23％。经过这样一算，贫农和下中农猛然觉悟到：“原来叫缺粮是跟上富裕中农和过去的地主、富农分子胡跑了”。随着大家又揭发了“过去上中农有牲口，给咱们耕一亩地赚二斗半粮食”；有些上中农合作化前产粮多，卖粮少，历来就抵抗统购统销；有些农户虽然留粮比合作化前减少，可是留粮还是够吃的。
    经过这样算账，把粮食问题上的谬论戳穿了。但是还有些富裕中农说：“社内留粮确实不够吃”，不承认今春闹供应是假缺粮。那么，究竟够吃不够吃呢？党支部和工作组又在群众中把供应户的粮食情况进行了排队。今年全社九十四户（三百一十四人）吃了供应粮三千八百八十斤，每人平均供应十三斤，有些社员每人只平均供应了三斤多粮食。再从九十四户供应户去年分粮数来看：有去年每人平均分粮四百斤以上到六百斤的八十一户，三百八十斤至四百斤的十三户。而以分粮四百五十斤以上的户“闹粮”的最多，占这些户的45％，分粮三百八十斤至四百斤的户，“闹粮”的只占30％。按照实际缺粮的情况，九十四户供应户中，只有一户因娶妻带来三口人留粮不够吃，有三十三户是留粮本来够吃，因吃粮浪费而实际缺粮，其余六十户都是假缺粮。
    算清了这两笔账，干部和社员的头脑清醒了。大家认识了“原来是粮少的不闹，粮多的闹”，是“过去靠粮食发财的上中农和地主富农分子闹”。
      统购统销对谁有利，谁拥护，谁反对？
    在广大贫农和下中农社员中分清了粮食问题上的是非界限以后，召开了一次全体社员大会。由工作组根据粮食统购统销政策，社内粮食情况和几天来小组辩论的情况，做了一个报告，着重批判了富裕中农的资本主义思想。会后，群众的思想更加清醒了，那些带头“闹粮”的资本主义思想严重的人孤立了。但他们还是不服。说什么：“咱们这一带是产粮区，农民吃粮应该宽裕些”，甚至说：“统购统销对全国有利，对苏家堡不利”，质问“苏家堡过去粮食很多，现在那里去了”。于是，又组织了一次统购统销政策的辩论。
    辩论的第一个题目是统购统销对个人究竟有利没利？有的提出：“过去不统购统销能随便买粮，现在有钱买不到粮”。大家辩论说：“过去能买粮穷人受剥削，现在没有粮食投机，物价稳定，还是对农民好。”比如粮食商人刘惠章过去贩卖粮食一个下午就能赚一头骡子，贫农李春晋在入社前一年，麦收前吃了别人的五斗高粱，麦收后就还了五斗小麦。于是，大家说：“不实行统购统销对富裕中农和粮食投机商人好，实行统购统销对缺粮的农民好”。接着，有些正直的富裕中农纠正了这种说法，他们说：“统购统销也不是对上中农不好，咱们过去担粮进城，粮贩子‘三拐’（拐两、拐合、拐零钱）‘一熬’（大秤），既误工又吃亏，现在把粮一次卖给国家，分毫不吃亏。看来，统购统销只对靠粮食投机发财的人不利。因此，咱们拥护，他们反对。”
    第二个题目是：粮食究竟那里去了？富裕中农张子治提出“过去村里有多少存粮户，现在都是个刚够吃”。刘玉印反驳说：不能光看粮食，还要看人口也增加了。抗战前咱村七百多口人，现在一千一百七十八口。再说过去粮多的只有地主、富农，现在是人人富裕”。大家还说：“抗日战争前千里不运粮，百里不运草，粮多的地方卖不了，粮少的地方不够吃，现在实行统购统销，能在全国调剂。”弄清了这些道理以后，这个问题也解决了。
    第三个题目是：国家不统购统销行不行？有些社员说“现在粮食紧张是国家工业建设规模过大了，要让农民多吃粮，除了兵工厂外把工厂都关掉，省下粮食让农民先改善生活，国家再建设”。李守奎反驳说：“这个做法不对，现在每天建设新工厂，日用品还是不足，工厂再少些，就该穿不上裤子了。”最后大家又联系到支援灾区、支援解放军，一致认为是应该的，认识了“国家粮食紧张是由于咱们国家兴旺，人多，建设规模大，这是好事不是坏事。”
    解决了这些思想问题以后，工作组又启发大家讨论要想多吃粮必须搞好生产。这样，大家就把情绪转到了生产上。有人说：“好好生产，向土地要粮吧，不要再向国家闹粮了”。
                                  （未完）
