Boldly Unleash, Resolutely Unleash, Thoroughly Unleash
—Southern Daily Editorial, September 21st

Carrying out extensive airing of views and debate is the first step in the current rural rectification and socialist education movement. In the pilot projects being conducted and the first batch of communes already rolled out, two situations have been discovered: One approach is to start with a firm and bold airing of views after the township cadre meeting, and to let it all out, with all kinds of opinions being expressed. This approach can be considered to be on the right path. The other approach is to be afraid of boldly airing views, not resolutely letting everything out, wanting to organize the team first before letting views be aired, or prematurely refuting them after a little airing, so nothing comes out, or only some opinions are voiced. This takes a detour, making the next step of debate difficult and requiring a return to the starting point. Therefore, whether views can be aired and whether they can be aired thoroughly is the key to the smooth or unsuccessful progress of the current movement. Based on the preliminary experience of pilot projects and the first batch of communes, the following issues must be addressed in order to carry out extensive airing of views and debate:

First, we must solve the issue of cadres' understanding of extensive airing of views and debate. Work teams and township/commune cadres are afraid of boldly airing views mainly because of two concerns. One is that they don't fully understand the significance of extensive airing of views and debate, so they are afraid of chaos. Some say, "Democratic management of communes before the summer harvest already made work difficult enough, if we air views again, the commune will collapse." Some say, "Views can be aired in first and second-class communes, but not in third-class communes." Others say, "If problems are raised that cannot be refuted, the situation cannot be salvaged," so they act timidly and dare not let things out. Some people see airing of views and debate merely as a way to find targets for criticism and struggle, so they collect materials and prepare for struggle as soon as views are aired, scaring away those who want to speak. Second, some township/commune cadres themselves have shortcomings and mistakes, and are afraid of criticism from the masses, or exaggerate and fail to distinguish right from wrong, and dare not let views be aired freely. Some even stipulate restrictive rules, such as saying "Correct opinions can be expressed, but opinions that are detrimental to production, unity, or the consolidation of the commune cannot be expressed," resulting in a cold and quiet atmosphere in which the masses dare not express their opinions. Some even secretly hinder the airing of views. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the thinking of cadres and give them a correct understanding of extensive airing of views and debate. This is a crucial key. First, cadres must clearly understand the basic requirements and objectives of this movement, which are to criticize the capitalist thinking of a small number of wealthy middle peasants, raise the socialist consciousness of poor and lower-middle peasants (including some upper-middle peasants), expose errors and shortcomings in work, improve cadre work styles, and effectively improve work through extensive airing of views, debate. The actual situation in cadre meetings and pilot projects can also be used to make them realize that regardless of first, second, or third-class communes, the struggle between the two roads, the influence of capitalist thinking, and shortcomings in work all exist. This is in line with the laws of development of objective things. Problems must be exposed in order to prescribe the right remedy and solve them separately. Covering up or suppressing them prevents exposure, like a boil, which will fester and develop, causing even greater harm to agricultural cooperatives. The experience of pilot projects has fully demonstrated that those communes where views are aired thoroughly and many problems are exposed (such as where 80% to 90% of the members express their opinions, and some communes raise hundreds or even thousands of opinions) also see greater enthusiasm and depth in the debate, and greater education of the masses. Those who are afraid of boldly airing views and do not expose any problems not only cannot prove that the original work was done well, but also affect the progress of this movement, making the debate lack enthusiasm and depth. It either becomes a mere formality or has to be redone. Therefore, it is necessary to make cadres deeply aware that this is a new working line for us to change our work style, overcome dogmatic propaganda and education methods, and truly take the mass line to solve internal problems among the people. For township/commune cadres with shortcomings and mistakes, it should be pointed out that sincere acceptance of criticism and correction of mistakes is beneficial to the Party, the commune, and themselves. Although it may be embarrassing in the short term to be criticized, it allows them to put down the burden and regain the trust of the masses. Some people are afraid that the masses will exaggerate facts, fail to distinguish responsibility, and fear that they can no longer be cadres. It should be explained that this time we will definitely seek truth from facts and distinguish right from wrong. Only by actively soliciting criticism from the masses, humbly examining and correcting shortcomings can they continue to be cadres. If they hinder the airing of views for personal gain, they will be making mistakes on top of mistakes if they do not rectify the commune well. As for the fear of chaos, it is mainly to make them believe that the majority of the masses, poor and lower-middle peasants, are firm in taking the path of collectivization. Through the airing of views, not only can the poor peasants express their opinions, but they can also be educated, further raising their awareness and freeing themselves from the influence of capitalist thinking represented by wealthy middle peasants. A temporary ideological confusion may be created when views are aired, but as long as we firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job, it will quickly turn around. Third-class communes need to air views even more in order to thoroughly solve the problems. If a cooperative really collapses as soon as views are aired, it would have collapsed even without airing views. It would not be a pity for such a commune to collapse and it can be reorganized. In fact, among the thousands of communes where views have already been aired, none have been found to be so incapable of withstanding the test. Therefore, not daring to boldly air views is a lack of correct assessment of collectivization, a lack of belief in the majority of the masses, or a fear of difficulties and unwillingness to do arduous ideological work, which is essentially a manifestation of right-leaning thinking.

Only by first clarifying the thinking of cadres, dispelling their concerns, and giving them a correct understanding of the airing of views can they truly implement, boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly unleash, and unleash deeply and thoroughly.

Second, we must constantly dispel the ideological concerns of the masses and encourage them to actively participate in the airing of views. The masses' concerns are mainly that they are afraid of making wrong suggestions and being struggled against like illegal landlords because of the crackdown on the counterattacks of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries in August (there have been individual cases of killing chickens, cutting down trees, and fearing struggle). Some are also afraid of being labeled as rightists like in the urban anti-rightist campaign. Others are afraid of hurting the feelings of cadres or being retaliated against. Some even set conditions and demand guarantees from cadres before making suggestions, or lack understanding of this rural rectification and commune consolidation campaign and do not actively participate. Therefore, it is necessary to first explain to the masses the importance of carrying out rectification and commune consolidation in the countryside. It is to help cadres overcome shortcomings, improve work, manage the commune well, improve production, and raise everyone's socialist consciousness. The method of rectification is to use the method of extensive airing of views, debate, which is the mass line method. Everyone can raise any opinions on production, cooperatives, unified purchase and sale of grain, etc. The township and commune can solve the problems locally, and those that cannot be solved can be reported to the higher levels. Different opinions can be discussed and debated; these are internal problems among the people, and they are resolved using the method of unity-criticism-unity. No one will be labeled as a rightist, and they will certainly not be struggled against like illegal landlords. Therefore, such concerns are unnecessary, and the destruction of production is even more wrong and harmful to the country and to oneself. Cadres must repeatedly express their attitude and guarantee that they will not retaliate against those who make suggestions to them. As long as the cadres have a clear attitude, there is an atmosphere of promoting democracy, patiently listening to various opinions without refuting them, and repeatedly mobilizing to dispel the concerns of the masses, the masses can be quickly mobilized.

Third, there must be appropriate working methods. Regardless of the type of commune, the first step should be to carry out extensive airing of views and debate (for those that have collapsed, the team should be reorganized). Although some opinions were exposed during the democratic rectification and investigation of contradictions in some communes in the previous stage, the airing was not thorough or universal. Therefore, at the beginning, a comprehensive airing of views should be carried out again. The method of airing views is to have poor and middle peasants air views together, mainly in production teams and production groups. Various forums and two- or three-person chats can also be used. Individual farmers outside the commune and landlords and rich peasants can also participate in the airing of views (the problems raised should be treated separately). When views are being aired, the leaders must listen patiently and not refute. Spontaneous small arguments among the masses can be carried out, but the leaders should not express their attitudes in order to avoid affecting the airing of views. The general process of development is to first raise positive opinions, then raise specific problems, and gradually expose different views and various capitalist ideas. In many communes, poor peasants speak more at the beginning, and wealthy middle peasants and those who are dissatisfied with collectivization and other issues only speak up at a certain time. Therefore, it is necessary to let views be aired thoroughly and have sufficient time (generally about a week) to allow people of all classes with different opinions to speak their minds. At this time, ideological confusion may occur, but we should remain calm and not be afraid of chaos, and insist on letting views be aired thoroughly. Only in this way can we better expose the shortcomings and errors of the work, so that we can improve our work well. At the same time, expose various problems and various ideological situations so that we can launch debates and conduct socialist education. Those who have already launched the rectification and socialist education movement but have not conducted the airing of views or have done it perfunctorily should conduct extensive airing of views again at an appropriate time. Moreover, after the concentrated airing of views step has passed, the spirit of extensive airing of views, debate should be implemented throughout the entire process of extensive debate and systematic improvement of work, rectification of the commune, the Party, and the League, and full democracy should be promoted, and all opinions and debates should be allowed. In fact, the entire movement is about implementing the struggle between the two roads. Therefore, extensive airing of views, debate should also be implemented throughout the entire movement.

Fourth, during the process of airing views, especially when the airing is almost complete, attention should be paid to ranking the opinions. We must pay close attention to collecting, sorting, and classifying the opinions raised by the masses. Correct opinions should be sincerely accepted and actively studied and corrected; misunderstandings should be clarified and explained appropriately after the airing of views is over; and erroneous opinions (mainly those related to capitalist ideas) should be analyzed, studied, and investigated in preparation for the next step of debate. These tasks should be studied and analyzed while airing views, and should be done meticulously.

Fifth, we should pay attention to rectifying and correcting while airing views. Promoting democracy, carrying out criticism, and improving work are one of the basic requirements of the entire movement. Therefore, from the beginning of the airing of views, we should pay attention to accepting the correct opinions of the masses in a timely manner. Anything that can be changed should be immediately accepted and corrected, such as problems that need to be solved immediately in the current production (drought resistance, abandoned fields, field management, etc.), and the correct parts of criticism of cadre work styles. This not only requires that the work be improved, but also can increase the enthusiasm of the masses and unite the majority of the masses. For example, when mobilizing the airing of views, some people think that even if suggestions are made, they will not be changed, so there is no point in making them again. The aim is to encourage everyone to actively air views through rectification and correction. Of course, it is not possible to solve many problems at this time, and only those that are obviously easy to handle and urgently need to be solved can be handled first. For problems that involve a wider scope or whose situation is not clear for the time being, do not rush to handle them rashly, nor can we abandon principles, violate policies, or accommodate the demands of a few people.

    大胆的放，坚决的放，彻底的放
    ——南方日报9月21日社论
    开展大鸣、大放，是当前农村整风和社会主义教育运动入手的第一步工作。正在进行的试点和已经铺开的第一批社，发现有这么二种情况：一种做法是在乡干部会议之后，首先从坚决大胆的鸣放入手，而且放透，什么样的意见都讲出来了。这样做就算路走对了。另一种做法是，不敢大胆鸣放，不坚决放透，想先组织好队伍再放，或者稍放就过早辩驳，因此，就放不出来，或者只放出了一部分意见，这样就走了弯路，使下一步辩论也很困难，而且要走回头路。因而，能否放起来，能否放透，便是当前运动顺利或失败的关键。根据试点和先行的第一批社的初步经验，开展大鸣大放，必须注意解决以下几个问题：
    首先必须解决干部对于大鸣大放的认识问题。工作队和乡、社干部，不敢放手大鸣大放主要有二个顾虑。一是对大鸣、大放意义认识很不够，因而怕乱。有的说：“夏收前民主办社，闹的工作已经很不好做了，再放，社要垮台了”，有的说“一、二类社可以放，三类社不能放”，还有的说：“放出问题驳不倒，局面无法收拾”，所以就小手小脚不敢大放。也有的人把鸣放仅仅看作是为了找几个批判斗争的对象，所以，稍为一放，就收集材料，准备斗争，把要讲的就吓回去了。二是有一部分乡、社干部本身有缺点，有错误，怕群众批评自己，或夸大了分不清是非，不敢放手鸣放。有的还规定清规戒律，如说“正确的意见可以放，不利生产、不利团结、不利社的巩固，不能放”，结果冷冷清清群众不敢提意见。甚至有的暗里阻碍鸣放。因此，必须弄通干部思想，使之对大鸣大放有正确的认识，这是重要的关键。首先要使干部明确这次运动的基本要求和目的，就是通过大鸣、大放、大辩论，批判少数富裕中农的资本主义思想，提高贫农下中农（包括一部分上中农）的社会主义觉悟，同时，揭发工作中的错误、缺点，改善干部作风，切实改进工作。还可以用干部会议和试点实际情况，使之认识不论一、二、三类社，两条道路的斗争、资本主义思想的影响、工作中的缺点都有存在，这是合乎客观事物发展规律的，有问题必须让其暴露出来，才能对症下药，分别解决，掩盖着或压着不让暴露，就和暗疮一样，要化脓和发展，就更是对农业合作社的大危害。试点的经验，已经充分证明，凡是放的透暴露出问题多的（如不少社百分之八、九十的社员都发表意见，有的一社就提出几百条上千条意见），辩论也就劲头大，辩的深，对群众教育大。凡是不敢大胆鸣放，没有暴露出什么问题，不但不能说明是原来工作做的好，而且，使这次运动开展受到影响，辩论没有劲，也不能深入，要不就走过场，要不就重新做。因此，使干部深刻认识，这是我们改变作风，克服教条主义的宣传教育方法，真正走群众路线来解决人民内部问题的新的工作路线。对有缺点有错误的乡、社干部，就要指出，诚恳接受批评，改正错误，对党、对社、对自己都有好处，挨了批评虽然面子上一时不好看，但可以放下包袱，重新取得群众信任。有的人怕群众扩大事实，分不清责任，怕不能再当干部。则应讲明这次一定实事求是分清是非，只有主动征求群众批评，虚心检讨、改正缺点，才能继续当干部。如果为个人得失而阻碍鸣放，整不好社便是错上加错。对于怕乱的思想，则主要使之相信群众大多数，贫农、下中农虽然有些意见，但是坚决走合作化道路的，经过鸣放，不但可以让贫农把自己意见讲出来，而且可以使之受到教育，更进一步提高觉悟，摆脱以富裕中农为代表的资本主义思想的影响。放鸣的时候可能会造成一时思想混乱，但只要坚决依靠贫农、下中农把工作做的好，很快就会转过来。对于三类社，更要鸣放，把问题暴露出来，才能得到彻底解决。如果真是有的合作社一放就垮台，即使不放也要垮台的，那样的社垮了也不可惜，可以另行组织，实际上，已经放的几千个社，还没有发现那么经不起考验的。所以，不敢放手鸣放，就是对合作化没有正确估计，就是不相信群众大多数，或者害怕困难，不愿做艰苦的思想工作，实质上是一种右倾思想的表现。
    只有首先打通干部思想，使之解除顾虑，对开展鸣放有了正确认识，并端正态度，才能真正贯彻执行，大胆的放，坚决的放，彻底的放，而且放深放透。
    其次，要不断地解除群众思想顾虑，使之积极参加鸣放。群众的顾虑主要是8月份刚刚打击了地主、富农、反革命分子的反攻倒算，怕提错了意见像不法地主那样斗争（已出现了个别杀鸡、砍树、怕挨斗争的现象），也有的怕像城市中反右派那样给自己扣上右派帽子，还有的怕和干部伤了和气，怕被打击报复，有的甚至提出条件要干部做保证才提意见，或者对这次农村整风、整社缺乏认识，而不积极参加。因此，就必须首先向群众讲明这次农村开展整风、整社的重要性，就是为了帮助干部克服缺点，改进工作，搞好社的管理，搞好生产，并使大家都提高社会主义觉悟。整的方法，就是大鸣大放大辩论的方法，也就是群众路线的方法。使大家不论对生产、对合作社、对粮食统购统销等各方面，有什么意见都可以提出来，乡和社能解决的就地解决，不能解决的反映上级，有不同意见可以进行讨论、争辩；这是属于人民内部问题，采用团结——批评——团结方式来解决，一律不扣右派帽子，更不会当成不法地主那样来斗争。所以这样的顾虑是不必要的，对生产的破坏更是错误的，对国家对自己都是有害的。干部还要反复表明态度，对干部提了意见，保证不报复。只要干部态度明确，有发扬民主的气氛，耐心听取各种不同意见，只听不驳，并反复动员解除群众顾虑，是可以很快发动起群众来的。
    再次，还要有恰当的工作方法。不论什么样的社；一开始都应该从开展大鸣大放入手（垮了台的应重新组织队伍），虽然前一段有一些社，在民主整社、查矛盾时暴露了一部分意见，但放的不彻底，不普遍。因此，一律要在开始时，首先再全面进行一次鸣放。放的方法，是贫中农一起放，主要在生产队、生产小组中放，还可以采用召开各种座谈会和三、二人漫谈等方法放。社外单干农民和地主、富农也可以参加鸣放（放出的问题应分别对待）。放的时候，领导要硬着头皮听，只听不驳。群众中自发的小争可以进行，但领导不要表示态度，以免影响鸣放。一般发展的过程是，先提正面意见，先提具体问题，逐步暴露出不同的看法，以至各种资本主义思想。不少社开始是贫农先讲的多，到一定时机富裕中农和对合作化等不满的人才讲。因此，一定要放透，要有较充分的时间（一般要一星期左右），让各阶层群众有各种不同意见的人，都把话讲出来。这时可能一度出现思想混乱的情况，但应该沉住气，不要怕乱，要坚持放彻底。只有如此，才能更好的揭露工作的缺点、错误，使我们能够很好改进工作。同时暴露出各种问题和各种思想情况，以便展开争论和进行社会主义教育。凡是已经展开整风和社会主义教育运动，而没有进行鸣放或者走了过场的，应该在适当时候重新进行大鸣大放。而且在集中的大鸣大放步骤过去之后，到大辩论以及系统改进工作，整社整党整团等整个过程，都应贯彻大鸣大放大争的精神，充分发扬民主，有什么意见都准许讲，准许争论。实际上，整个运动都是贯彻两条道路的斗争。所以，大鸣大放大争也要贯彻到整个运动的过程中去。
    第四、在放的过程中，特别在放的差不多了的时候，就应当注意进行意见排队。要很好注意把群众提出的意见进行收集整理，并分类排队，对于正确的，应该诚恳接受，积极研究改正；对于误会的，应弄清情况，等放鸣过去之后，进行适当的解释说明；对于错误的（主要是属于资本主义思想方面的）则分析研究，调查材料准备下一步展开辩论。这些工作，都要一边鸣放，一边进行研究分析，而且要细致的去做。
    第五、在大鸣大放中就应当注意边整边改。发扬民主，开展批评，改进工作是整个运动的基本要求之一。因此，从鸣放开始就要注意及时接受群众正确意见，凡是能改的，马上表示接受和改正，如属当前生产中马上要解决的问题（抗旱、丢荒田、田间管理等方面的），及对干部作风方面批评正确的部分。这不仅工作确实要改进，而且可以提高群众积极性，并团结大多数群众，如动员鸣放时，就有些人认为意见提了也不改，再提也没用。以求经过边改，更推动大家积极起来鸣放。当然，这时还不可能解决很多问题，只能是把明显易于处理的，迫切需要解决的问题先处理，对于牵涉面较大，或一时情况还搞不清楚的问题，则不要急忙草率处理，也不能放弃原则，违犯政策，去迁就少数人的要求。
