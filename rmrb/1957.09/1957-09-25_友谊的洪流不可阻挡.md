Having returned from my visit to Japan some time ago, I find the friendship of the Japanese people unforgettable. Compared with my previous two visits to Japan, the most profound feeling I had this time was that in Japan, the strata of people who demand Sino-Japanese friendship and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are becoming increasingly broader.

A good impression is deeply etched in my mind: On August 11th, I accompanied Chief Delegate Cai Tingkai on a visit to Fujikoshi Machinery Corporation in Kawasaki City. Manager Tetsuo Fujii and the company's employees waited at the gate to welcome us. Among the employees, Manager Fujii specifically introduced a tall, dark-complexioned young worker to Mr. Cai Tingkai. The worker immediately greeted Mr. Cai in Cantonese and introduced himself. He was an overseas Chinese named Cai Jiahong, from Guangdong, currently working as an apprentice in the factory, preparing to learn skills and return to the motherland to participate in construction. Mr. Cai said, "You are also surnamed Cai, we are family. Very good, wait until you learn your skills and then return to the motherland to participate in glorious construction work." I asked Cai Jiahong about his life and work in the factory. He said that the Japanese workers took good care of him and helped him master the technology. What a vivid example full of Sino-Japanese people's friendship! I noticed Mr. Fujii was smiling as he watched our cordial conversation with this overseas Chinese worker.

Also in this company, an overseas Chinese girl came to interpret for us. She was Chen Luni, the daughter of Shanghai painter Chen Baoyi, and worked as a Chinese language teacher at Fujikoshi. She told me that many people in the company were very interested in learning Chinese, believing that language is a bridge to convey friendship. Indeed, when I heard a representative of the employees present a gift to Mr. Cai and say "Presented to you" in Chinese, I felt extraordinarily cordial!

Still in this company, the acting mayor of Kawasaki City, city council members, and the vice chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry came specially to welcome us. In their speeches, they repeatedly expressed their desire to expand Sino-Japanese trade and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations as soon as possible. This shows that the scale of welcome for the Chinese delegation has crossed the walls of Fujikoshi Corporation—all levels of Kawasaki City are welcoming us, demanding Sino-Japanese friendship and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. In Japan, we encountered this kind of welcome scene more than once. When we passed through Okayama Prefecture on the train to Hiroshima, representatives from Okayama Prefecture were still waiting on the platform late at night to welcome us. Although it was only for a few minutes, it expressed the deep friendship between the Japanese and Chinese people.

As a news reporter, I also have personal experience. In my contact with the Japanese press, I strongly felt that Japanese journalists are willing to strengthen friendly exchanges with the Chinese press, and they hope to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries as soon as possible. On the issue of exchanging journalists between China and Japan as soon as possible, they and we have a common demand. Since China proposed to Japan the exchange of journalists last September and two reporters from Xinhua News Agency formally applied to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for entry, Japanese journalists have made many efforts for this. The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association has done a lot of work. The Japan Congress of Journalists has held a signature campaign to urge the Japanese government to agree to the entry of Chinese journalists. This time, in order to extend the duration of the Chinese journalists' stay, Minoru Yokota, the secretary-general of the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association, and Kiyoshi Iwamoto, a director of Kyodo News, went to the Ministry of Justice and directly negotiated with Minister Karasawa; Genzaburo Yoshino, the chairman of the Japan Congress of Journalists, held a symposium on the issue of Sino-Japanese exchange of journalists. Many Japanese journalists expressed their indignation at the Japanese government's deliberate obstruction on the issue of Chinese journalists' entry and our extension. They expressed their apologies to us, because before Chinese journalists could freely visit Japan, since 1953, a considerable number of Japanese journalists have successively visited China for short periods (some for more than half a year). I will never forget the scene when I left Tokyo late at night on August 23: Professor Mataichi Kido of the Institute of Journalism at the University of Tokyo, veteran Asahi Shimbun reporter Noboru Nomura, Haruo Kamiyoshi, the editor-in-chief of Kobunsha Publishing, and Yoshimori Tachibana, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Mainichi Shimbun, and many enthusiastic reporters from various newspapers came to the hotel and airport to see us off. Their common desire is: to make greater efforts in the future to promote the exchange of permanent correspondents between China and Japan.

Contrary to the wishes of people from all walks of life in Japan who demand Sino-Japanese friendship, the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet has restricted the friendly activities of the Chinese delegation. This unfriendly attitude of the Japanese government also left a deep impression on us.

However, the torrent of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people cannot be stopped. Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, Advisor Jiichiro Matsumoto, and Mr. Katsumada Seiichi, etc., had sincere contacts with the Chinese delegation. The welcome committee for Li Dequan's visit to Japan, centered on Katsuo Takenaka, the Nakayama Society, centered on Ryosuke Miyazaki, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, centered on Tetsu Katayama, and politicians from the Liberal Democratic Party, such as Tokutaro Kitamura and Kenzo Matsumura, etc., all had friendly exchanges with the Chinese delegation. They talked about the two thousand years of economic and cultural relations between China and Japan, and went straight to the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Inejiro Asanuma told us that the current Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy towards China is looking backward, and the Socialist Party wants to make him look forward.

The Japanese people expressed strong dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's attitude on the China policy. The situation of the 7th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association is a vivid illustration. The Chinese delegation participated in the opening ceremony of the congress and met with representatives from all over the country. Chairman Matsumoto Jiichiro said at the meeting that the Kishi Nobusuke government adopted a policy of subservience to the United States, hindering the development of friendly relations between Japan and China. He called on the members of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Japanese people to unite, smash artificial obstacles, and strive to promote the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Judging from the declaration adopted by the congress, this congress was very successful. The declaration of the congress stated that just as the Japanese people were eagerly expecting the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, the Kishi Nobusuke government not only adopted an unfriendly attitude towards China, but also made remarks provoking the 600 million Chinese people, which made the Japanese people deeply dissatisfied with the Kishi Nobusuke government. The declaration demanded that the Japanese government adopt a sincere attitude, resolve all important outstanding issues between China and Japan, and immediately send representatives to visit China and negotiate with the Chinese government. The declaration called on Japanese people from all walks of life to unite and take all methods and means to urge the Japanese government to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

On the second day after the closing of the Japan-China Friendship Association congress, the National Conference for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations also held a meeting of executive secretaries on August 20, and discussed the unfriendly attitude adopted by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet towards China, and decided to immediately convene a meeting of the board of directors to study the policy of taking protest actions against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Afterwards, I and Japanese friends discussed the significance of these two meetings. A Japanese friend said: This is a signal that the will of Japanese people from all walks of life to demand Sino-Japanese friendship will form a strong force. (Attached picture)

### 友谊的洪流不可阻挡

    友谊的洪流不可阻挡
    吴学文
    访日归来已有一段时间，但是日本人民的友情使我难以忘怀。和前两次访问日本的时候相比较，这次到日本感觉最深刻的是：在日本，要求日中友好和恢复日中邦交的阶层越来越广泛了。
    一个良好印象深深地刻在我的脑海里：8月11日，我随蔡廷锴团长去访问川崎市不二越精机股份公司，藤井哲夫经理和公司的职工一起等候在大门口欢迎我们。在职工的行列里，藤井经理特别把一位身材高高的、面色黑红的青年工人介绍给蔡廷锴先生。那位工人立刻用广东话向蔡先生问候，并且作了自我介绍。他是华侨，名叫蔡家洪，广东人，目前在那个工厂里当学徒，准备学好技术后回祖国参加建设。蔡先生说，你也姓蔡，咱们是一家子。很好，等你学好技术再回祖国去参加光荣的建设工作。我问起蔡家洪在工厂的生活与工作情况，他说，日本工人都很热心关照他，并且帮助他掌握技术。一个多么活生生的充满日中人民友谊的事例！我发现藤井先生正在微笑地看着我们和这位华侨工人亲切交谈。
    也是在这公司里，一位华侨姑娘来给我们作翻译，她是上海画家陈抱一的女儿陈绿妮，在不二越公司作中国语教员。她告诉我说，公司里有许多人对学习中国语非常有兴趣，他们认为语言是传达友谊的桥梁。确实如此，当我听到一位职工代表向蔡先生献礼并用中国话说“赠给您”时，感到异常亲切！
    还是在这个公司里，川崎市的市长代理、市议会议员和商工会议所副会长等特赶来欢迎我们。他们在致词中，一再表达了要扩大日中贸易和及早恢复日中邦交的意愿。这说明对中国代表的欢迎规模已经越过了不二越公司的墙垣——川崎市各阶层在欢迎我们，在要求日中友好与恢复日中邦交。在日本，我们不止一次遇到这种欢迎场面。当我们乘火车去广岛中途路过冈山县时，冈山县的代表们深夜里还等候在站台上欢迎我们。尽管是在短短的几分钟里，这却表达了日本人民同中国人民之间的深厚友情。
    作为一个新闻记者，我还有着切身的体会。在同日本新闻界接触中，我强烈地感到日本新闻界朋友是愿意和中国新闻界加强友好往来的，他们希望早日恢复两国的邦交。在及早实现中日两国交换记者问题上，他们和我们有着共同的要求。自从去年9月中国方面向日本提出交换记者和新华社两名记者向日本外务省正式申请入境后，日本新闻界的朋友曾为此作了很多努力。日本新闻协会作了不少工作。日本记者会议为促使日本政府同意中国记者入境，曾举行过签名运动。这次，为使中国记者能延长旅日期限，日本新闻协会事务局长横田实和共同社理事岩本清曾去法务省和唐泽大臣当面交涉；日本记者会议主席吉野源三郎曾为中日交换记者问题举行了座谈会。许多日本记者对日本政府在中国记者入境问题及我们的延期问题上故意为难表示愤慨。他们向我们表示歉意，因为在中国记者未能自由访问日本之前，自从1953年以来已经有为数不少的日本记者陆续地到中国作了短期（有的在半年以上）的访问。我永远不能忘记8月23日深夜离开东京的情景：东京大学新闻研究所教授城户又一、朝日新闻老报人野村宣、光文出版社编辑局长神吉晴夫以及每日新闻社编辑局次长橘善守等和许多热情的各报记者特到旅馆和机场送我们。他们的共同意愿是：今后要更加努力来促进中日两国交换常驻记者。
    和日本各阶层人民要求日中友好的意愿相反，岸信介内阁却对中国代表团的友好活动加以限制。日本官方这种不友好态度，也给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    然而，中日两国人民友谊的洪流是阻挡不住的。日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、书记长浅沼稻次郎、顾问松本治一郎以及胜间田清一先生等，和中国代表团进行了诚挚的接触。以竹中胜男为中心的欢迎李德全访日委员会、以宫崎龙介为中心的中山会、以片山哲为中心的日中文化交流会以及自由民主党的政治家北村德太郎和松村谦三先生等，都和中国代表团进行了友好的交往。他们从中日两国两千年的经济、文化关系谈起，直谈到恢复日中邦交问题。浅沼稻次郎对我们说过，目前岸信介内阁的对华政策是向后看，社会党要使他向前看。
    日本人民对岸信介在对华政策上的态度表示强烈的不满。日中友好协会第七次全国大会的情况就是个生动的说明。中国代表团参加了这个大会的开幕式，和来自全国各地的代表见了面。松本治一郎会长在会上说，岸信介政府采取屈从美国的政策，阻碍了日中友好关系的发展。他号召日中友好协会的会员和日本人民团结一致，粉碎人为的障碍，努力促使日中两国的邦交早日恢复。从大会通过的宣言看，这次大会是开得非常好的。大会宣言说，正当日本人民迫切期望恢复日中邦交的时候，岸信介政府不但采取了对中国不友好的态度，还发表了向中国六亿人民挑衅的言论，这使日本人民对岸信介政府深表不满。宣言要求日本政府采取诚实的态度，解决日中两国之间悬而未决的一切重要问题，并且立即派代表访问中国，同中国政府进行谈判。宣言呼吁各阶层日本人团结起来，采取一切方法和手段，促使日本政府恢复日中邦交。
    在日中友好协会大会闭幕的第二天，恢复日中邦交国民会议也在8月20日举行了干事会议，就岸信介内阁对中国所采取的不友好态度进行了讨论，并且决定立即召开理事会会议来研究对岸信介内阁采取抗议活动的方针。事后我和日本朋友曾谈论过这两次会议的意义。日本朋友说：这是日本各阶层人民要求日中友好的意志将要结成一个强大力量的信号。（附图片）
