	Is the "Accident-Free Award" Reasonable?
	In the national power industry system's reward system, there is an "accident-free award" equivalent to 20%-45% of a worker's base salary. During this period of "big airing of views" at the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, employees debated the reasonableness of this reward system. What follows are excerpts from some of the big-character posters on this issue.

	This is Disguised Wages
	Currently, a worker in our plant who has no accidents in production can receive an accident-free bonus of 20%-45% of their base salary each month. In the past, when there was no accident-free bonus, our plant did not have frequent accidents; now that there is an accident-free bonus, accidents have not been eliminated. Therefore, I believe that relying solely on "money" is not enough to eliminate or reduce accidents. We should strengthen workers' political education, raise their awareness, and at the same time strengthen the study of regulations and formulate safety measures.

	In my opinion, the accident-free bonus is a disguised wage because some production positions are not prone to accidents, and workers can easily receive the accident-free bonus every month. The accident-free bonus also violates the socialist wage system and wage standards of "to each according to his work." For example, the base salary of the shift supervisor, Zhao Jingang, is 108 yuan, and the monthly accident-free bonus is more than 40 yuan, totaling more than 150 yuan. However, the monthly salary of the plant director, Zhou Kechang, is only 130 yuan. Is this reasonable?

	In production, there is a post responsibility wage system, and in management departments, there is a job wage system. Both are fully responsible for their work. Why is it that in production, regardless of the quality of work, as long as there are no accidents, workers can receive an accident-free bonus every month, while management departments, even if they make no mistakes and complete their tasks every month, find it difficult to receive a quarterly first-class award equivalent to 25% of their base salary?

	In short, I believe that the current accident-free reward method is extremely unreasonable and should be adjusted quickly!

	Only Encourages Selfish Ideas
	I agree with Comrade Kang Junfeng's comments on the accident-free award.

	The accident-free award is a disguised wage. More than 95% of the personnel in the plant who are eligible for the accident-free award receive it. Many people have achieved more than fifty consecutive months of safety records. Even if there are some errors in their work or damage to instruments, only a portion of the bonus is deducted, and the bonus is still issued the following month.

	Because the bonus rate is too high, the bonuses for major machines and furnaces are high, while those for other types of work are low, and management departments do not have this kind of bonus. This has created a wide disparity in income between workers, and between workers and staff, resulting in some people wanting to work on major machines and furnaces and not wanting to do other work; wanting to engage in production and not wanting to do management work, and it has also fostered some people's selfish ideas. For example, a certain director, in order to get the bonus, shirks responsibility, and throws a tantrum if his bonus is to be deducted.

	I believe that safety in production should be handled in this way: First, give a certain amount of bonus to groups that have made significant contributions to safety and have consistently performed well, but not to each person individually. Second, when accidents occur, responsibility should be investigated, and those who are irresponsible should be given certain administrative punishments or criticism and education. Third, for those with poor working conditions, working conditions should be improved, or a certain allowance should be given. Ignoramus

	This is a Symbol of the New Society
	Kang Junfeng says that the "safety bonus is a disguised wage." I don't object to this statement, but in fact, it is not something that can be obtained every month. He also says that "this kind of bonus violates wage policy and should be abolished." This view cannot satisfy the broad masses of employees. ... The wage reward system not only encourages production and stimulates production, but more importantly, it symbolizes the difference between the old and new societies and confirms the superiority of the current social system. "It is unreasonable for workers to receive safety bonuses and it should be abolished." Should we emulate the wage system of the old society? Where is the superiority of the new society then? ... In the old society, there was no such thing as a reward system, and workers had no labor enthusiasm or initiative; there was no talk of safety, and it was impossible for workers to guarantee safe power generation for that society. The change in the social system now brings various superior systems to the workers, including the worker safety reward system, of course.

	In a power plant, "safety is the biggest saving." It is reasonable for workers to receive a bonus for ensuring safety while completing their production tasks each month. This is not a special privilege for production workers.
					Xuan Ya

	Feeling Ashamed
	It is the duty of an operator or maintenance worker to ensure the completion of tasks, ensure quality, and avoid any accidents. Therefore, we now feel somewhat ashamed to receive the safety award. Producing without accidents is originally the duty of our working class. Why do we have to be bought off with money to do so? Does it mean that we will not have accidents after receiving this money? Does it mean that we workers of the new society will only guarantee safe production because we have this money?

	In fact, the current safety award has become a kind of supplementary wage, an important source of income for employees, and can no longer play a rewarding role. Some people, because they are afraid of accidents and afraid of losing their safety award, are hesitant to take responsibility in their work, avoiding work, and even causing trouble and difficulties for other people's work. Workers push things to the team leader, team leaders push things to the director, directors push things to the engineer....

	What is even more ridiculous and worthy of consideration is that some technicians and administrators also receive this award. It is their duty to do their work well and avoid mistakes. Our plant's internal regulations also stipulate that every staff member should do their job well, without making mistakes or causing accidents. Does this only happen because of this magical money? Do our superiors think that we can only guarantee safety by using this so-called "bonus" to buy off workers? No, dear leaders, we are the awakened working class, we know how to work better, and we will never guarantee safety only after you give us this "award."

	Of course, appropriate care should be given to those who have difficulty in life and those who work in high temperatures (such as boilers). But this is definitely not a safety award, but a living allowance and a high-temperature subsidy.

	Finally, I call on our worker brothers and technicians who receive the safety award to consciously stop accepting this money that comes from an unclear source and that we are ashamed to take. Let us do our work better and show those leaders. Ming Feng

### “无事故奖”是否合理？

专栏：企业里的大字报

    “无事故奖”是否合理？
    全国电业系统的奖励制度中，有一种“无事故奖”，相当于工人基本工资的20％—45％。北京石景山发电厂的职工，在这次大鸣大放中，对这个奖励制度是否合理展开了争论。这里发表的，是关于这个问题的一部分大字报的摘要。
    这是变相工资
    现在我厂一个工人生产上无事故，每月能拿到基本工资20％—45％的无事故奖金。过去，没有无事故奖时，我厂也没有经常出事故；现在有无事故奖，也没有杜绝事故。所以，我认为要消灭或少出事故，单靠“钱”是不行的，应该加强职工政治教育，提高他们的觉悟，同时要加强对规程的学习，制定安全措施等。
    我认为，无事故奖金是变相工资，因为有的生产岗位不易出事故，工人不费吹灰之力，每月也可以拿到无事故奖金。无事故奖金也是违反社会主义按劳取酬的工资制度和工资标准的。例如，值长赵金刚的基本工资是一百零八元，每月无事故奖金四十多元，两者共一百五十多元，而管理厂长周克昌每月工资才一百三十元，试问这合理吗？
    生产上是岗位负责工资制，管理部门是职务工资制，都对自己工作负有全部责任，为什么生产上不管工作的好坏，只要不出事故，每月就能拿到无事故奖金，而管理部门即使每月不出差错，完成了任务，却很难拿到相当基本工资25％的季度一等奖呢？
    总之，我认为现行无事故奖励办法是极不合理的，应该赶快调整！
                                康俊峰
    只能助长自私思想
    我同意康俊峰同志对无事故奖所提的意见。
    无事故奖是变相工资。全厂实行无事故奖的人员95％以上都能得到无事故奖。很多人的安全纪录已经达到五十多个月，即使工作有一些错误或损害了仪器，也只是扣一部分奖金，下月还照发奖金。
    因为奖金率过高，主要机炉的奖金高，其他工种的低，管理部门没有这种奖，所以造成工人之间、工人与职员之间的收入相差悬殊，造成了有些人愿到主要机炉工作，不愿干其他工作；愿搞生产，不愿干管理工作，并且助长了一些人的自私思想。如某主任为了得奖金，推托责任，要扣他奖金就大发雷霆。
    我认为对安全生产应这样处理：一、对安全有重大贡献的和一贯好的小组，发给一定数量的奖金，但不是每人一份。二、对出事故的应追查责任，对不负责任的，应给予一定的行政处分或批评教育。三、对劳动条件差的，应改善劳动条件，或给以一定的津贴。无知者
    这是新社会的标志
    康俊峰说“安全奖是变相的工资”，我不反对这种说法，但事实上不是固定每月都能拿到的。他又说“这种奖金是违反工资政策的，应该取消。”这种看法不能使广大职工满意。……工资奖励制度不仅是鼓励生产和刺激生产，更重要的是标志着新旧社会的不同，证实当前社会制度的优越性。“工人拿安全奖不合理，应该取消”，难道应该向旧社会的工资制度看齐吗？那新社会的优越性在哪里呢？……在旧社会里，说不到什么奖励制度，工人也没什么劳动热情和积极性；说不到什么安全，工人也不可能为那个社会去保证什么安全发电。现在社会制度的改变，给工人带来各种优越制度，当然包括工人的安全奖励制度。
    发电厂“安全就是最大的节约”。工人在每月完成生产任务的基础上保证了安全而拿到奖金是合理的。这并不是生产工人特殊的待遇。
    　悬崖
    于心有愧
    一个运行人员或检修人员的职责，就是要保证完成任务，保证质量，不出任何事故。所以，我们现在拿安全奖是有些于心有愧的。生产不出事故，本来是我们工人阶级的分内之事，为什么还要用钱来买着我们这样作呢？难道我们拿了这种钱以后就会不出事故吗？难道我们新社会的工人，只是因为有了这笔钱才会保证安全生产吗？
    实际上，现在的安全奖已经成了一种附加工资，成为职工收入的一个重要来源，已经不能起到奖励的作用了。有的人，因为怕出事故，怕弄掉自己的安全奖，所以工作起来缩手缩脚，不想负责任，逃避工作，甚至给别人的工作带来麻烦和困难。工人的事推班长，班长的事推主任，主任推工程师……。
    更可笑的和值得考虑的是，一些技术员、管理员也拿这种奖。工作不出差错是他们自己的本份，我们厂的内部规划中也规定每一个工作人员应把自己的工作做好，不出差错和事故，难道只是因为有这笔神通广大的钱才执行规程吗？难道我们上级领导同志认为，只有拿这种所谓的“奖金”来收买工人，才会保证安全吗？不是的，亲爱的领导同志，我们是已经觉悟了的工人阶级，知道应当怎样更好地工作，决不会因为你给了我们这“奖”以后才去保证安全。
    固然对那些生活困难的人、在高温下工作的人（如锅炉）应当给予适当的照顾。但这决不是安全奖，而是生活困难补助费和高温津贴。
    最后，我呼吁我们拿安全奖的工人弟兄和技术员们，自觉地停止接受这种来路不明拿之有愧的钱，把工作做得更好，给那些领导者看看。　鸣峰
