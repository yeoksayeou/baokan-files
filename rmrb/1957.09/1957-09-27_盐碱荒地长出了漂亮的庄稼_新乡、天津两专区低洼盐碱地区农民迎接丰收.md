	Beautiful Crops Grow in Saline-Alkali Wasteland
	Farmers in Low-Lying Saline-Alkali Areas of Xinxiang and Tianjin Prefectures Welcome Bumper Harvests

	(Our Newspaper dispatch) In the Yellow River irrigation area of Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, there are more than 60,000 mu of low-lying, waterlogged, and lightly to heavily saline-alkali land. In the past year and the year before, the Yellow River Irrigation and Wei River Administration Bureau and the Xiaohe Farm conducted various experiments on this land. The results showed that only one mu of paddy rice planted last year grew well, yielding more than 600 jin of grain per mu.

	At the end of 1956, the Xinxiang Prefectural Saline-Alkali Land Improvement Committee was established, and it was decided to carry out large-scale soil improvement work. By mid-May of this year, more than 90,000 cubic meters of earthwork had been completed. At the same time, training courses were held, with members from various agricultural cooperatives participating to learn the practical operation of planting rice. This year, except for a small part that was flooded, most of the crops here are growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

	The facts have educated and encouraged the masses. A song is often circulated among the masses: "The saline-alkali wasteland has changed its appearance, the rice grows so beautifully, how can we not be overjoyed, we will plant well next year." At present, the agricultural cooperatives are welcoming the harvest and actively planning for next year's work.

	(Our Newspaper dispatch) This year, counties in the Tianjin Prefecture have planted one million mu of rice and glutinous rice on the basis of transforming low-lying saline-alkali land, more than double that of last year. At present, these crops are generally growing well. According to the harvest in some areas, it is estimated that a total of 480 million jin of grain can be produced, with an average yield of about 400 to 500 jin per mu.

	With the arrival of the bumper harvest, these areas, which have always relied on national supply, now have surplus grain for sale. In the past, five areas, namely Kuang'ergang in Wuqing County, Tuanbowa and Dahebei in Jinghai County, Jianch鋪 (Jianchapu) and Wangbo in Baxian County, needed the state to transfer 39 million jin of grain from other places every year. This year, not only do they not need the state to supply them, but it is estimated that they can also export more than 50 million jin of surplus grain.

	In order to further increase grain production in low-lying and saline-alkali areas, the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to develop two million mu of rice and glutinous rice in these areas next year. At present, the agricultural cooperatives are harvesting rice on the one hand and designing next year's projects on the other.

    盐碱荒地长出了漂亮的庄稼
    新乡、天津两专区低洼盐碱地区农民迎接丰收
    本报讯　河南省新乡专区的引黄灌区有六万多亩低洼易涝、轻重不同的盐碱地。在去年和前年，引黄灌溉济卫管理局和小河农场在这片土地上进行了多种试验，结果只有去年试种的一亩多水稻生长良好，每亩收谷六百多斤。
    1956年底，新乡专区成立了盐碱地改良委员会，同时决定进行大面积的改良土壤工作。到今年5月中旬为止，完成了土方工程九万余公方。同时举办了训练班，由各农业社派社员参加学习种植水稻的实际操作。今年，这里的庄稼除少部分被水淹没外，绝大部分生长良好，丰收在望。
    事实教育和鼓舞了群众。群众中常流传着这样一首歌子：“盐碱荒地变了样，水稻长的真漂亮，怎不叫咱喜洋洋，明年咱要好好种一场。”目前，各农业社正在迎接丰收和积极筹划明年的工作。

    本报讯　天津专区各县今年在改造低洼盐碱地的基础上，种植了水稻、淀稻一百万亩，比去年扩大了一倍多。目前，这些庄稼普遍生长良好。根据部分地区的收获情况看，估计共可产谷四亿八千万斤，平均亩产约四百斤至五百斤。
    随着丰收的到来，这些历来依靠国家供应的地区，现在有余粮出卖了。武清县的筐儿港、静海县的团泊洼、大河北，坝县的煎茶铺、王泊等五个地区，过去，每年需要国家从外地调入粮食三千九百万斤，今年不但不需要国家供应了，估计还可以输出余粮五千多万斤。
    为了使洼地和盐碱地更多地增产粮食，中共天津地委计划明年在这些地区发展水稻、淀稻二百万亩。目前各农业社正在一面收割稻子，一面设计明年的工程。
