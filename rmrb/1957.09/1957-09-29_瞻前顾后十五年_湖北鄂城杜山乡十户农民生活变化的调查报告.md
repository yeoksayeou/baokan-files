    Looking Back and Ahead Fifteen Years
    —An Investigation Report on the Living Changes of Ten Peasant Households in Dushan Township, Echeng, Hubei
    Investigation by Wang Ruisheng, Ou Baohua, Zhu Chuqin
    Organized by Xinhua News Agency Reporter Qu Yifan
　　In order to deeply understand the changes in the economic lives of farmers at all levels, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China sent personnel from the Rural Work Department to the Xuguang No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Dushan Township, Echeng County, to conduct in-depth investigations and interviews with ten peasant households. Among these ten households, three households including Li Hongxiu, Li Hongyuan, and Li Jinhua were poor peasants; three households including Xiao Gongyuan, Xiao Shigu, and Xiao Shisen were general middle peasants; and the other four households were old wealthy upper-middle peasants Xiao Shijin, Xiao Shisheng, Xiao Gongzi, and new wealthy middle peasant Xiao Shiheng. This investigation material reflects the distinct changes in the lives of the masses in the new and old rural areas. In particular, it highlights the improvement in the living standards of the vast number of farmers after rural cooperativization, like the rising sun, soaring upwards; and the prospects of the new socialist countryside are even more promising and infinitely bright!
A Summary Account of Life Changes Over Nine Years
    Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative in Dushan Township is located on the shore of Liangzi Lake on the south bank of the Yangtze River, with fertile soil and abundant rice and cotton, belonging to a relatively affluent area in the river and lake area of Hubei Province.
    The investigators spent more than half a month visiting and investigating these ten peasant households. In addition to comprehensively understanding the life changes of these ten peasant households over the past nine years, they focused on selecting four representative years to specifically calculate detailed accounts: namely, 1948 before liberation, when the lives of farmers were very poor; 1952 in the early days of liberation, when the lives of farmers began to improve after land reform and production recovery; 1955, the year after a severe flood, when farmers in this township actively participated in agricultural cooperatives (elementary cooperatives) in the production and disaster relief movement, not only quickly restoring the rural landscape before the flood, but also achieving amazing achievements in developing agricultural production and improving farmers' lives; and 1956, a year particularly worthy of historical record, when this township fully realized advanced cooperativization and achieved unprecedented bumper harvests.
    Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative mainly produces cotton, followed by rice. The cooperative has an average of 1.24 mu of paddy and dry land per person, and each labor force is responsible for about 4 mu. The cooperative has 121 mu of cotton fields (double cropping of wheat and cotton). The average yield of cotton per mu increased from 60 jin of ginned cotton in 1952 to 121 jin in 1956; the cooperative has 752 mu of rice fields, and the average yield per mu also increased from 600 jin in 1952 to 1,004 jin in 1956. The agricultural income of this cooperative in 1956 increased by 66.4% compared with the bumper harvest of 1955. With the annual growth of agricultural production, the living standards of cooperative members are also constantly improving day by day.
    The following investigation statistics table is a summary account of the life changes of these ten peasant households over the past nine years.

    From the above materials, it can be seen that since liberation, especially after cooperativization, the actual income of poor peasants, general middle peasants, and wealthy middle peasants has greatly increased compared with before liberation; the living standards of farmers at all levels have also improved greatly compared with before liberation. Among them, the changes in 1955 and 1956 were the fastest, fully demonstrating the great superiority of agricultural cooperativization. This rural area, which belongs to the relatively affluent river and lake area, has more favorable natural conditions than ordinary rural areas. However, it can be seen from the investigation of these ten peasant households that favorable natural conditions can only fully play their role after liberation, especially since the realization of cooperativization. With the same land and the same ten peasant households, they could only obtain an average annual income of 30 to 50 yuan per person from the land before liberation (taking 1948 as an example); after realizing cooperativization, their income soared to more than 100 yuan.

            Detailed Accounts of Food, Clothing, Housing, and Transportation
    The first detailed account: Food - including staple food and non-staple food:

                                            Unit: Jin
    The second detailed account: Clothing - including clothes, shoes, socks, bedding, etc.　　Unit: Chi
    The third account: Daily pocket money - including adding furniture, common merchandise, tuition, buying books, medical treatment, watching operas, watching movies, etc.
    The fourth detailed account: Special expenses (average number per household)
    Because Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative mainly produces cotton, the cooperative members still need the state to supply a portion of their rations. Therefore, from the first detailed account above, although the production of this cooperative has grown rapidly and income has increased a lot, the ration only guarantees enough to eat. However, it can still be seen from the table that the rations of the three poor peasant households and the three general middle peasant households have increased a lot in the years after liberation compared with before liberation. The rations of the four wealthy middle peasant households in the past two years are slightly less than the average of the other six households, mainly because these four households are all large families with many children, and the average supply per person is less. Farmers are satisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sales. According to the reflection of the poor peasants: before liberation, they usually ate bran and vegetables for half a year and grain for half a year. Even during the busy farming season, they only ate one dry meal and two meals of thin porridge mixed with melon and vegetables every day; in years of disaster, it was even worse. Nowadays, most farmers eat two dry meals and one thin meal every day during the slack season; male farmers eat two dry meals and one noodle meal every day during the busy farming season, and some eat rice for all three meals. As for oil, salt, fish, meat, and vegetables, all levels and households eat more than in previous years.
    The clothing of farmers is much better than before liberation! It is not possible to explain how farmers dress by measuring the amount of cloth purchased in a certain year alone. According to the average number of cloth used by each household in 1952, 1955, and 1956 compared with 1948, poor peasants increased by 75%, and middle peasants increased by more than doubled. In addition, in recent years, almost every household of these ten peasant households has added two or three sets of sanitary underwear, and three wealthy middle peasant households have knitted four woolen sweaters, and one household has bought a leather jacket; in the past, men, women, old and young all wore cloth shoes of the same color, but now young men and women and children almost all wear sneakers and galoshes (rubber shoes). Farmers generally reflect that the clothing aspect has been very different from the past in recent years, and they wear more and better clothes. Of course, some farmers have very sufficient economic conditions and want to wear better clothes in the future. Therefore, they inevitably have some opinions on the current distribution and use of cloth coupons.
    From the fourth detailed account above, in recent years, the special expenses of farmers in each household have been very large. This expense is mainly used for the basic construction of farmers - building and repairing houses, or for marrying daughters and celebrating happy events. From the great flood in 1954 to 1956, all ten peasant households renovated the old houses that were flooded, and some households also replaced the original thatched houses with new tiled houses. For example, the poor peasant brothers Li Hongxiu and Li Hongyuan, according to the income of these two households in 1956, their lives could be very good; but they saved money and thrift, and in the autumn, the two brothers jointly built a new five-room tiled house - in their view, this was their "centennial plan."
    In terms of the daily pocket money of the ten peasant households, it is worth mentioning that the cultural life of farmers has changed greatly. In 1948, only three children in these ten peasant households attended elementary school, but now there are thirteen elementary school students and two middle school students. In addition, farmers now often watch movies in the evening (movie teams go to the countryside to show movies) and watch operas. Some farmers specifically take buses to Echeng City, which is ten miles away, to watch operas during holidays. The cooperative has clubs and health centers. Farmers also pay more attention to personal hygiene than in the past.
    The debts that were the "historical burden" on the heads of poor peasants have also been relieved or are close to being relieved. For example, poor peasant Li Hongyuan had heavy debts due to years of insufficient income before liberation. In 1948 alone, he owed five bolts of white cloth, 115 jin of ginned cotton, and 2.5 shi of grain. When the end of the year approached, he fled to other villages to avoid debts and did not dare to go home. Now, among these three poor peasant households, one household has paid off its debts last year and still has more than 30 yuan left. The other two households still owe tens of yuan in foreign debts, which can basically be paid off this year.

    瞻前顾后十五年
    ——湖北鄂城杜山乡十户农民生活变化的调查报告

    新华社记者　曲一凡　整理
　　中共湖北省委员会为了深入地了解各阶层农民经济生活的变化，曾由农村工作部派人到鄂城县杜山乡旭光第一农业社，对十户农民进行了深入的调查访问。这十户农民中，有李宏秀、李宏元、李金花等三户是贫农，肖功元、肖仕谷、肖仕森等三户为一般中农，另四户是老富裕上中农肖仕进、肖仕胜、肖功梓和新富裕中农肖仕恒。这个调查材料反映了新旧农村群众生活鲜明的变化，特别突出地是农村合作化以后，广大农民的生活水平的提高，犹如旭日东升，扶摇直上；而社会主义的新农村的远景，更是前程远大，无限光明！　　　九年间生活演变的一笔总账
    杜山乡旭光一社，在长江南岸的梁子湖滨，土质肥沃，盛产稻棉，属于湖北省沿江滨湖地带较为富庶的地区。
    调查人花费了半个多月的时间，在这十户农民中进行访问和调查。他们对十户农民过去九年间的生活变化，除了全面地了解情况以外，着重地选出四个有代表性的年份具体算了细账：即解放前的1948年，农民的生活十分穷困；解放初期的1952年，农村经过了土地改革和生产恢复工作，农民生活水平开始上升：前一年遭受了严重水灾的1955年，这个乡的农民在生产救灾运动中纷纷参加了农业合作社（初级社），不仅迅速地恢复了水灾前的农村面貌，而且在发展农业生产和改善农民生活方面获得了惊人的成就；历史上特别值得记载的一年1956年，这个乡全面实现了高级合作化，取得了前所未有的农业大丰收。
    旭光一社以棉花生产为主，水稻次之。全社水旱田一起，每人平均一点二四亩，每个劳动力负担四亩左右。全社有一百二十一亩棉田（麦棉两熟），棉花平均亩产由1952年的六十斤皮棉，到1956年提高到一百二十一斤；全社有七百五十二亩稻田，平均亩产也由1952年的六百斤，提高到1956年的一千零四斤。这个社1956年的农业收入，比丰收的1955年增加了66.4％。随着农业生产的逐年增长，社员们的生活水平也在日新月异不断的提高。
    下面一个调查统计表，就是这十户农民九年来生活演变的一笔总账。
    从上面材料看：自解放以来，特别是合作化以后，无论是贫农、一般中农以及富裕中农，他们的实际收入都比解放前大大地增加了；各阶层农民的生活水平也都比解放前提高了许多。其中尤以1955、1956两年，变化最快，充分显示了农业合作化的巨大优越性。这个属于沿江滨湖较为富庶的农村，论其自然条件比一般农村较为优厚。但是，从这十户农民的调查看出，优厚的自然条件只是在解放以后、特别是实现合作化以来，才能充分地发挥它的作用。属于同样的土地，同是这十户农民，他们在解放前（1948年为例），每个人平均一年只能从土地上获得三、五十元的收入；实现了合作化，他们的收入竟一跃而普遍地上升到百元以外。
            衣食住行的几笔细账
    第一笔细账：吃的方面——包括主食和副食两方面：
                                            单位：斤
    第二笔细账：穿布——包括穿衣、鞋袜、被褥等　　单位：尺
    第三笔账：日常零花钱——包括添制家具、常用百货、学费、买书、治病、看戏、看电影等。
    第四笔细账：特殊开支（以户为单位的平均数）
    旭光一社因以棉花生产为主，社员们的口粮至今还需要国家供应一部分。所以从前面第一笔细账来看，虽然这个社的生产增长很快，收入增加也很多，而口粮一项只保证吃饱。但是，从表中仍可看出，三户贫农和三户一般中农解放后历年的口粮，还是比解放前增加了许多。四户富裕中农近两年的口粮比其他六户的平均数要少一些，主要是因为这四户都是大家庭，小孩子很多，大小人平均起来供应量就显得少了些。农民们对实行统购统销政策是满意的。据贫农的反映：解放以前，他们平常是半年糠菜半年粮，即使在大农忙期间，每天也只吃得一餐干饭、两餐稀粥拌瓜菜；碰上灾荒年景，那就更是提不得了。如今，农闲时，大多农户也吃的是每天两干一稀；男农民在大农忙中，有的每天吃两餐干饭、一餐面饭，有的三顿都是米饭。至于油、盐、鱼、肉和蔬菜，各个阶层和各户都比往年吃得多了。
    农民的穿着，更不知比解放前好过多少倍！单从某一年的购布数量来衡量农民穿着如何，是不能说明问题的，根据1952、1955、1956三年各户用布的平均数与1948年比较，贫农增加了75％，中农增加了一倍以上。另外，这十户农民近几年来，几乎家家户户都添置了两三套卫生衣裤，并有三户富裕中农织了四件毛线衣，还有一户买了皮袄；过去，男女老少一色的布鞋，现在男女青年和儿童差不多都穿上了球鞋、套鞋（胶鞋）。农民们普遍反映：近几年在穿着方面比过去大不相同了，穿的又多又好。当然，有些农户经济条件很充裕，今后要求穿的更好一些，因此，不免对目前的布票分配和使用方面有一些意见。
    从前面的第四笔细账看，近几年，各户农民的特殊开支很大，这笔开支主要用来进行农民的基本建设——盖房修屋，或者用于娶媳妇嫁女办喜事等。自1954年大水后到1956年，这十户农民全部把被水淹坏的旧屋翻修一新，一部分户还把原来的茅草屋换成了新瓦屋。如贫农李宏秀、李宏元两弟兄，根据这两户1956年的收入，生活是可以过得很好的；但是他们却省吃俭用，到秋后两弟兄合伙盖了一栋五间的新瓦屋——在他们看来这就是他们的“百年大计”。
    十户农民的日常零用钱方面，值得特别提一提的，是农民的文化生活已有很大的改变。1948年的时候，这十户农民中只有三个孩子上小学，而现在已有十三个小学生，两个中学生。另外，现在农民们还常常在晚上看电影（电影队下乡放映）、看戏。有些农民在逢年过节的假日里，特地乘汽车赶到相距十里的鄂城城里看戏去。合作社里设有俱乐部、卫生所。农民的个人卫生也比过去讲究得多了。
    作为“历史包袱”压在贫农头上的债务，也已经解除或接近解除了，如贫农李宏元，由于解放前历年入不敷出，负债很重，仅1948年即欠债白布五匹、皮棉一百一十五斤，欠谷账二点五石；到年关逼近时为了躲债，逃到外乡不敢回家。现在这三户贫农中，去年已有一户把债还清后还余剩三十多元，另有两户还欠几十元的外债，今年也基本可以还清。
