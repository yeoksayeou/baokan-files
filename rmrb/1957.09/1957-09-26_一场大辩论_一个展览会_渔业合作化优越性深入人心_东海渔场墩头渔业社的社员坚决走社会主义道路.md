    A Great Debate, An Exhibition
    The Superiority of Fisheries Cooperatives Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts
    Members of the Duntou Fisheries Cooperative in the East China Sea Fishing Grounds Firmly Take the Socialist Road
    (Our Newspaper) A correspondent reports that in Putuo County on the Zhoushan Islands, there is a Duntou Fisheries Production Cooperative, which is a relatively large cooperative in the East China Sea Fishing Grounds. Recently, the members of this cooperative launched a major debate on whether fisheries cooperatives are actually good or not.

    An Accounting, An Event
    During the debate, everyone calculated an account: When working individually, in 1951, the entire cooperative produced 20,449 dan of fish; in 1952, it produced 32,229 dan; in 1953, it produced 33,561 dan; and in 1954, it produced 23,947 dan. After establishing the cooperative, in 1955, it produced 39,669 dan; and in 1956, it produced 80,546 dan. The output in 1956 increased by 2.9 times compared to 1951. After establishing the cooperative, two new motorized sailing boats, thirty-one large wooden sailing boats, and sixty-nine small wooden sailing boats were built. The cooperative's public accumulation increased from 47,000 yuan at the time of establishment to 377,000 yuan, a growth of seven times. The members said, "We have so much property, you can't knock me out of the cooperative even if you try!"
    During the debate, everyone talked about such an event: A member of the cooperative named Huang Along, tempted by fishery capitalists, withdrew from the cooperative last winter and set up his own boat, wanting to get rich by working alone. By this autumn fishing season, not only did he not get rich, but he also lost thirteen yuan, selling three newly made cotton quilts, a large cabinet, and a load of buckets. The members talked about it with laughter, saying, "Ah Long, Ah Long, so unlucky, not wanting to be a happy person, but wanting to be a poor one!"

    Compare Again, Calculate Again
    "Does the cooperative make more income? Or does individual work make more income?" When debating this question, many people shared their personal experiences. In the three years before the cooperative was established, the average annual income per worker was 302 yuan; in the two years after the cooperative was established, the average annual income per worker was 598 yuan, an increase of 98%. Fishermen Hu A'hong's income last year was 708 yuan, an increase of 136% compared to the 300 yuan income in the year before the cooperative was established. Poor fisherman Xu Jianneng's income last year was 829 yuan, an increase of 78.3% compared to the average annual income in the three years before the cooperative was established. General fisherman Chen Fuquan's average annual income in the three years after joining the cooperative was 1,032 yuan, an increase of 145% compared to the average annual income of 420 yuan in the three years before the cooperative was established. Individual worker Zhou A'chun's total income from last winter fishing season to this summer fishing season was 362 yuan in eight months; his son, Zhou Zhongyuan, who joined the cooperative, had poorer skills than his father, but his income was 455 yuan in the same eight months.

    During the debate, everyone adopted the method of individual comparisons and household calculations. Through the debate, the members generally reflected: The superiority of cooperativization becomes clearer with each debate.

    Take Another Look at the Exhibition
    While debating, the cooperative also held a recall and comparison of physical objects exhibition. The main content of the exhibition was to compare the living conditions of fishermen before and after liberation.

    In the exhibition, you could see: Before liberation, fishermen ate chaff, vegetables, and bran; now, they eat rice, flour, and pastries. In the third electoral district of Duntou, out of 108 households, only three fisher-tyrant households ate white rice before liberation, twelve general fisher households could barely eat enough, seventy-six households often ran out of food, using six-grain paste, bran soup, and yellow rice bran to fill their stomachs, and sixteen households ate grass and wild vegetables; now, every household can eat rice, and some even make New Year cakes and wrap zongzi.

    In the old society, grain prices rose three times a day, and poor people could not buy rice. Fisherman Fan Caicai went to Shenjiamen Town to buy rice, and the person before him paid three yuan per dou, while the person after him had to pay three yuan and five jiao per dou; with only one person in between, the price increased by five jiao. Fisherman Zhang Deyun could not buy rice before going to sea and ate small yellow croakers for five days on the boat. Fisherman Lin Guifu's eight-year-old daughter died of bloating from eating grass because they could not buy rice. In the new society, grain prices are stable, and supplies are guaranteed.

    The fishermen shed tears when they saw the exhibits of wild grass and other physical objects at the exhibition. Lin Dongsheng's wife said: I used to eat wild grass for two months, and now I have 25 jin of rice a month, which is enough for me to eat, and it would be really ungrateful to say there isn't enough to eat.

    Before liberation, fishermen wore rags. Fisherman Zhou A'hui wore a tattered cotton-padded jacket for ninety years and a tattered cotton-padded trousers for seventy years. Fisherman Zhang Yueding's family of six shared a tattered cotton quilt for forty years. Fisherman Guo A'pei and his brother took turns wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket when they got married. After the cooperative was established, the members of the cooperative bought a total of eighty-five pairs of woolen trousers, ten woolen coats, three thousand pounds of wool, one hundred watches, forty-two pairs of leather shoes... The vivid facts displayed at the exhibition moved every member who saw them. Member Miao Jiquan said: "Before liberation, I only had two ragged clothes and a ragged jacket; after joining the cooperative, I bought more than twenty zhang of cloth and made eleven new sets of clothes. Without cooperativization, where would today's happiness come from?"

    一场大辩论　一个展览会
    渔业合作化优越性深入人心
    东海渔场墩头渔业社的社员坚决走社会主义道路
    本报讯　舟山群岛上的普陀县，有一个墩头渔业生产合作社，是东海渔场较大的一个社。最近，这个社的社员们就渔业合作化究竟好不好开展了大辩论。
    一笔账，一件事
    在辩论中，大家算了一笔账：单干的时候，1951年，全社产鱼二万零四百四十九担，1952年产鱼三万二千二百二十九担，1953年产鱼三万三千五百六十一担，1954年产鱼二万三千九百四十七担。办社以后，1955年产鱼三万九千六百六十九担，1956年产鱼八万零五百四十六担。1956年的产量比1951年增加了二点九倍。办社以后，新造机帆船二只，大型木帆船三十一只，小型木帆船六十九只，合作社的公共积累由办社时四万七千元，增加到三十七万七千元，增长了七倍。社员们说，阿拉有伽多财产，要我退社，敲也敲不出去！
  在辩论中，大家谈起这样一件事：这个社有一个社员叫黄阿龙，被渔业资本家引诱，去年冬汛退了社，自己搞了一只船，想单干致富。到了今年秋汛，不但没有富起来，反而亏本十三元，卖掉了三条新做的棉被、一口大橱、一担水桶。社员谈起都笑着说，“阿龙阿龙真倒幸，福人不做做穷人！”
    再比比，再算算
    “合作社收入多？还是单干收入多？”在辩论这个问题的时候，许多人都谈出了切身的体会。办社前三年，每个劳动力平均每年收入是三百零二元；办社后二年，每个劳动力平均每年收入是五百九十八元，增加了98％。渔工胡阿红去年收入七百零八元，比办社前一年收入三百元增加136％。贫苦渔民徐建能去年收入八百二十九元，比办社前三年每年平均收入增加78.3％。一般渔民陈夫全，入社后三年每年平均收入一千零三十二元，比办社前三年每年平均收入四百二十元增加145％。单干户周阿春，去年冬汛到今年夏汛，八个月共收入三百六十二元；他的儿子周中元参加了合作社，技术比父亲差，同样八个月，收入四百五十五元。
    在辩论中，大家采取了个个对比、户户算账的办法。通过辩论，社员普遍反映：合作化的优越性愈辩愈明。
    展览会上再看看
    在辩论的同时，社里举办了一个回忆对比实物展览会。展览会主要内容是对比解放前后渔民生活状况。
    在展览会上可以看到：解放前，渔民吃的是糠、菜、茹；现在，吃的是米、面、糕。墩头第三选区一百零八户，解放前，只有三户渔霸吃白米，十二户一般渔民勉强吃得饱，七十六户经常断粮，用六谷糊、茹汤、黄米糠充饥，十六户吃青草、吃野菜；现在，户户都能吃上大米，有的还打年糕、包粽子。
    旧社会粮价一日三涨，穷人买不到米。渔民范采财到沈家门镇买米，前一个人三元一斗，后一个人就要三元五角一斗；相隔一人，涨价五角。渔工章德云，出海前买不到米，在船上吃了五天小黄鱼。渔民林贵夫的一个八岁的女孩，因买不到米，吃草胀死。新社会粮价平稳，保证供应。
    渔民们看了展览会上陈列的野草等实物，都流下泪来。林东生的妻子说：我以前吃过两个月野草，现在一个月有二十五斤米足够我吃，再说粮食不够吃真没良心。
    解放前，渔民穿的破烂不堪。渔工周阿会，一件破棉袄穿了九十年，一条破棉裤穿了七十年。渔工张岳定，一家六口合盖一条破棉被四十年。渔工郭阿配两兄弟结婚的时候轮着穿一件破棉袄。办社以后，全社社员总共买了八十五条呢裤子、十件呢上衣，三千磅毛线，一百只手表，四十二双皮鞋……。展览会上展出的活生生事实，使社员们看了个个感动。社员缪纪全说：“解放前我只有两件破衣，一件破袄；入社以后，买了二十多丈布，做了十一套新衣服。没有合作化，哪有今天的幸福？”
