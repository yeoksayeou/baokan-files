    长沙衡阳各机关认真边整边改
    据新华社长沙21日电　湖南省级机关和长沙、衡阳两市市级机关正在根据工作人员在整风中提出的意见，努力改进工作。
    全省对外贸易系统职工从5月以来提出的合理意见二百多条，已经有九十多条得到处理，正在处理的有六十条。衡阳市各机关职工提出的合理意见约七百多条，已经有四百多条意见中提出的问题得到解决。省航运厅根据职工提出的合理意见，制定了分港分月财务收支计划，改变了从前只问生产不问成本的偏向。
    各级机关的领导作风都比以前有了改进，能够迅速发现问题和解决问题。工业厅派出干部一百多人，组成工作组，到各厂矿检查增产节约运动，帮助解决了许多问题，使直属六十个厂矿8月份完成总产值计划101.85％，二十八种产品中就有二十种超额完成计划。公路厅厅长到平江县解决了这个县路面坏不能通车、影响紧急运粮的问题。这个厅的四个工程师深入工地检查，仅一个月时间就节约桥梁、码头等工程投资十万元。
