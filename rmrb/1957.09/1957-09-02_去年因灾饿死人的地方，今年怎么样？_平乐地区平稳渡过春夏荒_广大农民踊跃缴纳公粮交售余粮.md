Where people starved to death due to disasters last year, what's the situation this year?
    The Ping Le Region Smoothly Overcame the Spring and Summer Famine
    The Broad Masses of Peasants Actively Pay Public Grain and Sell Surplus Grain

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) The Ping Le Region of Guangxi Province suffered an unprecedented severe drought last year, and serious incidents of starvation deaths occurred. The Party and the People's Government accepted the painful lessons of this event and fully led the disaster-stricken people to produce and save themselves. Since the beginning of spring this year, they have continuously conducted general surveys of the food consumption of disaster victims, made arrangements for each household, and ensured the food supply for more than 872,000 people in more than 200,850 grain-deficient households, thus smoothly overcoming the spring and summer famine.

    In order to ensure timely supply, all the automobiles and 23,000 tons of civilian ship transport capacity of the Ping Le Region were fully投入to grain transportation; in addition, automobiles and civilian ships were transferred from other regions to transport rice transferred from Jiangxi, Hunan, and Yunnan. The grain transportation work overcame numerous difficulties. From January to July this year alone, more than 67,110,000 catties of rice and 3,170,000 catties of coarse grains and flour were transported from Yunnan, Jiangxi, Hunan and other four provinces and three regions within the province, which guaranteed the needs of the disaster areas and also adjusted the non-staple food grain for the market, enlivening the market.

    The grain was transported from thousands of miles away and went through multiple transfer links, and the vehicle, ship, and handling fees were very high, but the state still sold the grain to the disaster victims at the local listed price. For example, the transportation cost alone for the 5 million catties of grain transferred from Hunan cost an additional 80,000 yuan. From January to June, the transportation cost of grain transported from Yunnan, Jiangxi, and other places was as high as 5.25 yuan per dan, but the grain price sold by the state remained unchanged. The state subsidized a total of 1,060,000 yuan for the price difference, vehicle and ship fees, and handling fees for the more than 60 million catties of grain transported into the region. Calculated at the local medium rice price of 6 yuan per 100 catties, this is equivalent to 17,660,000 catties of grain.

    The people of Ping Le Region have historically suffered many disasters. In the past, as long as there was a disaster, people would flee famine, beg for food, and starve to death everywhere. The bourgeois rightists used the incident of starvation deaths in Guangxi last year to maliciously attack the Party, saying that the unified purchase and sale of grain had ruined everything. Let them open their eyes and look at the facts!

    Only by recalling the suffering of the past can we appreciate today's happiness. The peasants here said: Without the unified purchase and sale of grain, the state would not be able to control the grain, and helping our disaster-stricken peasants would be empty talk.

    After the summer harvest, the broad masses of peasants in the Ping Le Region actively handed over public grain and sold surplus grain. As of August 19, the region had put more than 14,430,000 catties of grain into storage, and some districts and townships had completed or exceeded the summer grain purchase task.

    去年因灾饿死人的地方，今年怎么样？
    平乐地区平稳渡过春夏荒
    广大农民踊跃缴纳公粮交售余粮
    本报讯  广西平乐专区去年遭受了数十年未有的大旱灾，曾发生严重的因灾饿死人的事件。党和人民政府接受这次事件的沉痛教训，全力领导灾民生产自救，在今年入春以来，连续普查灾民吃粮情况，逐户作了安排，保证了二十万零八千五百多缺粮农户八十七万二千多人的粮食供应，平稳地渡过春夏荒。
    为了保证及时供应，平乐专区全部汽车和二万三千吨民船运力全力投入运粮；另外还从其他地区调拨汽车、民船，接运从江西、湖南、云南调入的大米。运粮工作克服了重重困难，从今年1至7月，仅从云南、江西、湖南等四省和省内三个专区运进的大米有六千七百一十一万余斤，小杂粮、面粉三百一十七万余斤，保证了灾区的需要，而且调剂了市场副食品用粮，活跃了市场。
    粮食是从遥遥千里运来的，经过了多次中转环节，车船、搬运费很大，但国家还是按照当地牌价把粮食卖给灾民。例如从湖南调入的五百万斤粮食，单运费一项就多开支八万余元。1至6月由云南、江西等地运入的粮食，每担运输成本高达五元二角五分，可是国家售出的粮价仍然不变。全区运进的六千多万斤粮食，国家补贴差价、车船费、搬运费共为一百零六万余元。按当地中等稻谷价每百斤六元计算，等于一千七百六十六万斤粮食。
    平乐专区的人民，在历史上曾多次受灾害的浩劫。过去，只要一遭灾荒，逃荒、求乞、饿死人的现象到处皆是。资产阶级右派分子利用广西去年因灾饿死人的事件恶意攻击党，说粮食统购统销搞糟了，请他们睁开眼睛看看事实吧！
    回忆过去的苦，才能想到今天的福。这里的农民说：如果没有粮食统购统销，国家就不能掌握粮食，接济我们灾区农民就会是空话。
    夏季收获以后，平乐专区的广大农民，踊跃交公粮，卖余粮，到8月19日止，全区已入库粮食有一千四百四十三万余斤，其中有些区乡完成或超额完成了夏粮征购任务。 （蓝忠、邓瑞贤）
