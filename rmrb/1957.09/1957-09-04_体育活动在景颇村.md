    Sports Activities in a Jingpo Village
    By Our Correspondent Tie Min
    Nongbing Village in Luxi County, Yunnan Province, sits at an altitude of over 2,000 meters. It's a settlement of the Jingpo ethnic group on the top of Nongbing Mountain. As you climb the mountain road, the first thing you see is not the Jingpo people's thatched houses hidden in the lush bamboo groves, but a wide, flat sports field. This is the sports ground of the Jingpo ethnic primary school in Nongbing Township.
    Speaking of this sports field, it is impossible not to recall the arduous start of this primary school.
    The Great Han chauvinism of the Kuomintang reactionaries made the Jingpo brothers hate and distrust the Han people. After liberation, when the ethnic work team went to Nongbing Mountain in 1952 to set up a school for them, these brothers were still very suspicious: Are the Han people really here to help us? After a lot of work, they understood that the Communist Party was indeed sincere in helping them. The school was finally established, but there were no students. The teachers went door-to-door to mobilize, and to other Jingpo villages to mobilize. Finally, they managed to find more than a hundred children.
    Due to the poverty of the past, the children were not in good health and needed exercise. In 1953, the Shan Guan (the head of the village) agreed to donate a piece of land, and the teachers led the children to level the hillside with their own hands and create this sports field.
    On the day the sports field was completed, the young women of the village all came to watch. With puzzled expressions, they asked each other: What is this all about!
    Activities began. Basketball, volleyball, horizontal bars, parallel bars, etc.—things they had never seen before liberation. At first sight, they were novel and interesting. The children all rushed to play, and even the young people in the village put aside the Axi dance and the elephant-foot drum dance and rushed to play ball.
    Thus, sports activities began in this remote mountain village.
    Every evening, dozens of boys and girls play ball on the sports field. After years of practice, they no longer just scramble randomly and can play decently. The children don't particularly like playing volleyball or badminton, feeling it's not exciting enough. They love basketball the most.
    Broadcast exercises have also been carried out here. Every morning, in the dawn light, the sports field is filled with children, led by the teacher to do exercises. The red "tong" skirts (a kind of skirt woven from wool) of the girls and the white headscarves of the boys are a delightful contrast.
    The school holds two sports meets every year, which the children find most interesting. Almost all the students participate in the competitions. Basketball, running, and tug-of-war are the children's favorite events. The children who especially like sports on weekdays hope to show off their skills at the meet!
    Last year, on "June 1st" Children's Day, the school sent dozens of children to Zhefang in Luxi County to participate in the Zhefang District student sports meet. There, they competed with children of the Dai, Han, and other ethnic groups. As expected, they were well-trained. Apart from the tug-of-war, the Jingpo children won all the championships in all the competition events.
    Who would have thought that under such difficult conditions in Nongbing Village, sports activities would really blossom and bear fruit?

    体育活动在景颇村
    本报记者　铁民
    云南潞西县弄丙寨，海拔二千多公尺，是弄丙山头上的一个景颇族聚居的寨子。当你沿着山路爬到山头时，首先看见的，不是荫蔽在茂林修竹中的景颇族居民的茅屋，而是一个宽阔的、平坦的体育场。这里就是弄丙乡景颇族小学的体育场。
    提起这座体育场来，就会令人回想到这个小学的创业维艰。
    国民党反动派的大汉族主义逼得景颇族兄弟们对汉族产生了仇恨和不信任。解放后，当1952年民族工作队上弄丙山去为他们办学校时，这些兄弟们还是百般疑虑：汉人真是来帮助我们的吗？经过很多工作，他们明白了，共产党的确是真心来帮助他们的。学校终于办成了，可是没有学生。教师挨门挨户去动员，到别的景颇寨子去动员，最后还好，找到了一百多个孩子。
    由于过去的贫困生活，孩子们的身体不够好，需要锻炼。1953年山官（即一寨之主）同意拿出一块土地，老师领着孩子们，用他们的双手把山坡削平了，开辟了这个体育场。
    体育场落成的那天，寨子里的青年妇女都跑来看，他们怀着不理解的心情互相问：这究竟是搞什么呀！
    活动开始了。什么篮球啊，排球啊，单双杠啊，等等，这些在解放前看都没有看见的东西，乍一看见，真是新奇有趣，孩子们都抢着玩，就连寨子里的青年们也把阿细舞、象脚鼓舞放到一边，赶着来玩球了。
    体育活动就这样在这个僻静的山村开始了。
    每到傍晚，体育场上总有几十个男女孩子玩球。几年来的练习，他们已不是乱抢，也能玩得像个样子了。孩子们对排球、羽毛球不大爱玩，觉得不过瘾，他们最爱玩篮球。
    广播体操也在这里展开了。每天早晨，在晨晞中，体育场上站满了孩子，由老师领着作操。女孩子的红色统裙（一种用羊毛织的裙子）和男孩子的白色头巾，真是相映成趣。
    学校每年举行两次运动会，最使孩子们感到兴趣，每次几乎全校学生都参加了比赛。篮球、赛跑和拔河是孩子们最喜欢参加的项目。平日特别喜欢运动的孩子们，多希望在会上一显身手啊！
    去年“六一”儿童节，学校派了几十个孩子到潞西县遮放去参加遮放区学生运动会。在那里，他们同傣、汉等族的小朋友们较量了一番。果然是锻炼有素，除去拔河一项之外，所有的比赛项目的冠军，都被这些景颇族孩子们夺来了。
    谁能想到，在弄丙寨这样的困难条件下，体育活动真的开花结果了呢。
