Now, the task of establishing national autonomous areas has been largely completed, the scattered minority nationalities have realized the right to national equality, minority cadres have grown and expanded rapidly, socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory in the vast majority of minority areas, and economic and cultural construction in minority areas has also greatly developed, and the lives of people of all ethnic groups have generally improved greatly. On the socialist economic foundation, socialist national relations have been formed among all ethnic groups in our country. These achievements are the result of the joint efforts of the Party and the government leading the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

Liu Chun said that in recent years, the national minorities affairs institutions of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also, according to the specific circumstances of the local area and in accordance with the work duties stipulated in the "Trial Organization Rules for Nationalities Affairs Commissions of People's Governments at All Levels," under the leadership of the local Party and government, publicized the Party's and the state's national minorities policies, conducted investigations and research on the conditions of national minority areas, mediated national disputes, organized national minority visiting groups, delegations, work teams, and various types of forums, and accepted and processed the opinions of people of all ethnic groups on national minorities affairs work. Some regions have also conducted surveys of minority languages and the formulation of writing schemes, translation work of minority languages, investigations of ethnic components, historical and social investigations of minority nationalities, organization and resettlement of minority immigrants, and job placement work for minority veterans. In addition, in the various functional departments of local state organs, local national minorities affairs institutions have played an active coordinating and assisting role in all work involving minority nationalities. And they have cultivated a group of cadres who are familiar with the conditions of national minorities and the business of national minorities work, and have also accumulated a lot of experience in their work. It can be affirmed that our work achievements are very great.

Regarding what main work the national minorities affairs institutions will do in the future and how to carry out the work, Liu Chun, in his report, based on the specific situation of socialist construction in our country and national minority areas, proposed that the future work tasks of the national minorities affairs institutions of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are: to assist relevant local departments to continue to promote the policy of national regional autonomy and fully realize the autonomous rights of minority nationalities; consolidate the achievements of the socialist revolution of minority nationalities and continue to complete the socialist transformation; strengthen the economic and cultural construction of minority nationalities and further improve the lives of minority nationalities; guarantee the equal rights of minority nationalities living in mixed or scattered communities; strengthen the propaganda work on national minorities issues; continue to attach importance to the training of minority cadres and strengthen the work of national minority colleges and various cadre schools or training courses; strengthen contacts with upper-class minority figures, implement the policy of freedom of religious belief, continue to organize and further improve the visiting work of minority nationalities; and strengthen the work of handling letters and visits from the people.
