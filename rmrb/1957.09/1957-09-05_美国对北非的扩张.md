    US Expansion in North Africa
    Ji Kuang

    The Suez crisis deepened the crisis of France's colonial rule in North Africa. The United States took the opportunity to carry out active expansion activities. It not only declared that North African countries should be included in the region where the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is promoted, but also is planning to organize a new aggressive group called the "Mediterranean Pact."

            Long Coveted

    The United States' ambition to invade North Africa has been around for a long time. As early as World War II, especially after France surrendered to Hitler in June 1940, it attempted to replace France's colonial position in North Africa. After the U.S. troops landed in North Africa in 1942, the U.S. immediately carried out military and economic expansion activities. It established the Port Lyautey naval base and the Bou-Aou, Nouasseur, Sidi Slimane, and Ben Guerir air bases in Morocco; and the Bizerte naval and air force base and the Mellaha bomber base in Tunisia. Under the pretext of "aid," it obtained the right to import goods into North Africa, obtain raw materials specially needed for war from North Africa, and participate in the "development" of French colonial resources; and completely or partially controlled the exploitation of Tunisian oil and the production of Moroccan cobalt, uranium, zinc, and lead. Even in Algeria, which French colonialists considered their lifeline, there was a large amount of American investment.

    In recent years, the United States has intensified its expansion in North Africa. In the autumn of 1955 and 1956, the Foreign Affairs Committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate sent delegations to visit Africa. In December of last year, Dulles submitted a memorandum to Eisenhower, in which he proposed a plan to invade the Middle East (including the North African region). This March, Nixon visited eight countries in Africa, with North African countries being the focus of his activities.

        "Mediterranean Pact"

    Organizing the "Mediterranean Pact" is a concrete plan for the United States to expand into North Africa. The United States proposed this plan as early as 1951, but it failed to materialize at that time due to British opposition and other reasons. In the first half of 1956, when the U.S. Ambassador to France, Dillon, visited Spain, Morocco, and Italy, he proposed that France, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, and other countries conclude a "Mediterranean Pact." This March, when Nixon visited North African countries, he was tasked with planning and promoting the conclusion of a "Mediterranean Pact" including North African countries.

    Robert S. Allen, a reporter for the "New York Times," once pointed out the purpose of the United States' plan to organize this new group. He said: The United States established this group in order to "defend the U.S. strategic base in the Mediterranean region" in the future. "A strong alliance will not only become an effective tool to deal with Egypt in the Mediterranean, but also greatly weaken Egypt's influence in other Arab countries." In fact, this is only part of the American conspiracy. The members of this group include European and African countries on both sides of the Mediterranean. Among them, Morocco and Spain occupy the gateway from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, and Tunisia and Italy control the channel of the Strait of Sicily. The United States controls this group, and it firmly grasps the hegemony of the Mediterranean. At the same time, linking this group to the North Atlantic Group in the west and the Baghdad Pact in the east forms a continuous encirclement line against the Eastern European people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union from the south.

    In addition, the composition of this aggressive group will further weaken the influence of Britain and France in the Mediterranean. Dulles clearly stated in his memorandum to Eisenhower that bringing these countries into the scope of the United States' "strategic responsibility" would allow the United States to implement corresponding measures in this region without consulting with traditional British and French partners.

            Collusion Activities

    When organizing this group, the United States is using Spain to carry out collusion activities. Franco clamored in his year-end speech last year that the territory of North Africa constitutes the spine of Europe, it belongs to the western region of Europe, and it will share the fate of this region. According to a United Press International report last December, the Franco government plans to establish a "North African Federation" in 1957 "to establish harmonious relations with the West" in order to further win over North African countries to participate in the "Mediterranean Pact." This year, the King of Saudi Arabia went to Spain on his way home after visiting the United States, and the Sultan of Morocco and the Prime Minister of Libya, along with two speakers of parliament, also went to Spain at the same time. They held a joint meeting. Although the results of the meeting were not announced, Western newspapers revealed that the "Mediterranean Pact" issue was one of the main topics of the meeting. At present, the United States is actively trying to pull Spain into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is by no means accidental.

    In order to bring together the partners of the "Mediterranean Pact," the United States has also used "economic assistance" as a means to threaten and lure North African countries in recent months.

    The United States also pretends to be an "anti-colonialist" fighter, using the strong national sentiment of the North African people against French colonialism to win the trust of the North African people. The "North African Federation" was initiated and organized in North African countries to maintain national independence and strive for the national independence of Algeria. The United States is attempting to make it serve Washington's aggressive policies.

        Conspiracy Will Eventually Fail

    This approach of the United States in North Africa has aroused dissatisfaction from France. As early as after the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was announced, French Foreign Minister Pineau expressed opposition to expanding this doctrine to North African countries. When Nixon visited Morocco, French Senator Debre accused him of unfriendly behavior towards France in Morocco and asked the government to protest. The French "Le Monde" published an article entitled "Is the United States Still Our Ally?" exposing that the United States has shown great strategic and economic interest in the Mediterranean and Africa since 1942. The newspaper sharply rebuked "the United States is playing a hypocritical trick, and the result is neo-colonialism." Not long ago, the United States and Tunisia signed an economic "aid" agreement, and the French "Perspectives" weekly angrily questioned the government: "How long will it tolerate the actions of its so-called allies to sell it out?" It is obvious that with the intensification of American expansion activities, the contradictions between the United States and France will inevitably become increasingly acute.

    At the same time, the disguised colonialism of the United States has gradually exposed its ugly face among the North African people. Social figures and some newspapers in Tunisia exposed the essence of "U.S. aid" as making the Tunisian government a certain "trade organization" of the United States to promote American goods. When the Libyan parliament met in February this year, the parliamentarians demanded that the government not lease land to the United States and accused the Americans of acting as if they were on their hereditary territory in Libya, without cherishing the interests of the Libyan people. After the United States created the Jordanian coup, and then its plan to subvert the Syrian national government was exposed, the North African people saw more clearly the American colonialism disguised under the Eisenhower Doctrine.

    The people of North Africa have awakened, and they have the ability to recognize who their enemies are. The US conspiracy plans and aggressive expansion activities in North Africa will eventually suffer a shameful defeat.

### 美国对北非的扩张

    美国对北非的扩张
    吉匡
    苏伊士事件加深了法国在北非的殖民统治危机。美国趁机进行积极的扩张活动。它不仅宣布北非国家应该包括在推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的地区内，而且还在策划组织“地中海公约”这个新的侵略集团。
            垂涎已久
    美国侵略北非的野心由来已久。早在第二次世界大战期间，尤其是1940年6月法国投降希特勒以后，它就企图取代法国在北非的殖民地位。1942年美国军队登陆北非后，美国紧接着就进行军事和经济的扩张活动。它在摩洛哥建立了里奥蒂港海军基地和布敖、努瓦塞、西迪斯利曼和本古里等空军基地；在突尼斯建立了比塞大港的海空军基地和梅拉哈的轰炸机基地。它以“援助”为名，取得了把商品输入北非、从北非取得战争特需原料和参加法国殖民地资源“开发”的权利；并且全部或部分地控制了突尼斯石油的开采、摩洛哥钴、铀、锌和铅的生产。即使在被法国殖民主义者认为命根子的阿尔及利亚，也有着美国的大量投资。
    最近几年来，美国对北非的扩张日益加强。1955年和1956年秋，美国众议院和参议院的外交委员会先后派出代表团访问非洲。杜勒斯在去年12月给艾森豪威尔一份备忘录，其中又提出了侵略中东（也包括北非地区）的计划。今年3月尼克松在非洲访问了八个国家，北非国家是活动重点。
        “地中海公约”
    组织“地中海公约”，这是美国目前向北非进行扩张活动的一项具体计划。美国的这个计划，早在1951年就提出过，当时由于英国的反对及其他原因而未能实现。1956年上半年，美驻法大使狄龙访问西班牙、摩洛哥和意大利等国时，又提出了由法、意、西、摩、突等国缔结“地中海公约”的建议。今年3月，尼克松访问北非国家时，就负有策划和鼓吹缔结一个包括北非国家在内的“地中海公约”的使命。
    “纽约时报”记者罗伯特·斯·艾伦曾经指出美国策划组织这个新集团的目的。他说：美国建立这个集团，是为了将来“保卫美国在地中海区域的战略基地”。“强大的联盟不仅成为对付埃及在地中海的有效工具，还可大大削弱埃及在其他阿拉伯国家的影响”。其实，这还只是美国阴谋的一部分。这个集团成员包括了地中海两岸的欧洲和非洲国家，其中摩洛哥和西班牙据地中海出大西洋的门户，突尼斯和意大利扼西西里海峡的孔道，美国控制了这个集团，也就稳稳地掌握了地中海的霸权。同时，再把这个集团西边与北大西洋集团、东边与巴格达条约联结一起，便从南边对东欧人民民主国家和苏联形成一条连续的包围线。
    另外，这个侵略集团的组成，将使英法在地中海的势力遭到进一步的削弱。杜勒斯在给艾森豪威尔的备忘录中就清楚地说，把这些国家圈进美国“战略责任”的范围内，可使美国不必同传统的英法伙伴商讨就在这一地区执行相应的措施。
            纠合活动
    美国在组织这个集团时，是利用西班牙出面进行纠合活动的。佛朗哥在去年年终发表演说时，就叫嚷说，北非的领土构成了欧洲的脊椎，它属于欧洲的西部地区，而且将与这一地区共命运。据去年12月合众社消息说：佛朗哥政府策划在1957年成立一个“同西方建立融洽关系”的“北非联邦”，以便进一步拉拢北非国家参加“地中海公约”。今年，沙特阿拉伯国王在访美返国途中到了西班牙，摩洛哥苏丹和利比亚首相偕两位议长也同时到了西班牙。他们共同举行了会谈。会谈结果虽未宣布，但据西方报纸透露，“地中海公约”问题是会谈主要内容之一。目前，美国积极设法想把西班牙拉进北大西洋公约集团，这决不是偶然的。
    为了撮合“地中海公约”的伙伴，几个月来，美国还用“经济援助”作手段对北非国家进行威胁利诱。
    美国还把自己装扮成一个“反殖民主义”的战士，利用北非人民反对法国殖民主义的强烈民族情绪来骗取北非人民的信任。“北非联邦”，在北非国家，是为了维护民族独立、争取阿尔及利亚民族独立而倡议组织的。美国却企图使它为华盛顿的侵略政策服务。
        阴谋终将失败
    美国在北非的这种做法，已经引起了法国的不满。早在“艾森豪威尔主义”宣布后，法国外交部长比诺就表示反对这个主义扩大到北非国家。尼克松访问摩洛哥时，法国参议员德勃雷就指责他在摩洛哥时对法国不友好的态度，并要政府提出抗议。法国“世界报”曾刊载了“美国仍是我们的盟友么？”一文，揭露美国从1942年后就对地中海和非洲表现了极大的战略和经济兴趣。这家报纸尖锐地斥责“美国在搞伪善的把戏，而其结果是新殖民主义。”不久前美突签订了经济“援助”协定，法国“展望”周报便气愤地责问政府：“对它的所谓盟国出卖它的行动将要忍耐到什么时候？”很明显，随着美国扩张活动的加紧，美法矛盾也必将日益尖锐。
    同时，美国经过伪装的殖民主义，在北非人民中也已经逐渐暴露出它的丑恶面目。突尼斯的社会人士和某些报刊就揭露“美援”的实质，是使突尼斯政府变成美国的某种“贸易机构”来推销美国的商品。今年2月利比亚议会开会时，议员们要求政府不把土地租给美国，并斥责美国人好像在利比亚是在他们世袭的领土上一样，毫不珍惜利比亚人民的利益。在美国制造了约旦政变，接着它阴谋颠覆叙利亚民族政府的计划败露之后，北非人民对于在艾森豪威尔主义伪装下的美国殖民主义，看得更为清楚了。
    北非人民已经觉醒了，他们有能力认清谁是他们的敌人，美国在北非的阴谋计划和侵略扩张活动，在最后终将遭到可耻的失败。
