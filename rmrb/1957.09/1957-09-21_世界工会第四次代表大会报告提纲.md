Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: The General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Louis Saillant, has prepared a report outline for the first item on the agenda of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, for discussion among workers in various countries. The summary of the outline is as follows:

The 14th Executive Committee Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions (held July 24-27, 1957) stipulated that the agenda of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress (hereinafter referred to as "the Fourth Congress"), to be held in Leipzig from October 4-15, 1957, would be as follows:

	(1) A report on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and on the development of friendly relations and solidarity in the international trade union movement in order to improve the living standards of workers, to strive for the economic, social and democratic rights of workers, and to strive for disarmament, peace and national independence.

	(2) The tasks of trade unions in the struggle against colonialism.

	(3) Report of the Credentials Committee.

	(4) The Administrative Committee of the International Workers Solidarity Fund on its activities, its experiences, and the assistance it can provide for the further development of international solidarity.

	(5) Proposals for amending the Constitution of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

	(6) Election of the leading bodies of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Credentials Committee.

Since the Third World Trade Union Congress (hereinafter referred to as "the Third Congress") held in Vienna in October 1953, the working classes of various countries have gained new and rich experiences, which are valuable lessons for the entire trade union movement.

The task of "the Fourth Congress" is to analyze, study, and compare the experiences gained by millions of men and women workers in their struggles around the world, and to evaluate the results.

The primary purpose of "the Fourth Congress" is to be a congress of unity, an international conference for broad and friendly discussions. It must help determine ways and methods for carrying out unified action by the working class at the national and international levels.

It must help establish new and broader international trade union ties.

(I) Facts Confirm the Correctness of the Resolutions of the Third World Trade Union Congress

"The Third Congress" pointed out that capitalist monopoly organizations are intensifying their policies of exploiting workers.

"The Third Congress" pointed out that it is possible for workers to unite, and that various trade union factions must act together, because they all express common aspirations.

Regarding the defense of peace, "the Third Congress" declared that it favors a policy of consultation and opposes the implementation of a policy of strength in relations between countries, regardless of the political and social systems of these countries.

"The Third Congress" reiterated the World Federation of Trade Unions' opposition to colonialist exploitation. In particular, it called on workers all over the world to support the struggle of the people of all countries for national independence, against imperialism, and for an end to the colonial system.

"The Third Congress" recommended greatly expanding international ties between trade union factions and national trade union federations, without any discrimination.

This is the course of action that the World Federation of Trade Unions has taken since "the Third Congress," and the development of the situation has once again proved that the resolutions of the Third Congress are in line with the interests and aspirations of workers and people of all countries. The Fourth Congress, to be held in Leipzig in October 1957, will also be prepared in this spirit.

(II) Assessment of the Development of the International Situation

The development of the international situation is characterized by a series of obvious failures suffered by imperialism, while the strength of the people has greatly increased.

The imperialist expansion of monopoly organizations has been greatly restricted by the struggle of the people of all countries against colonialism and for national independence. A new type of policy based on respect for the rights of each country, non-interference in internal affairs, a new type of international cooperation, and opposition to all political and racial discrimination as the basis of relations between countries is increasingly gaining popular support.

The struggle among imperialist countries and state blocs for markets is becoming increasingly fierce.

Imperialist forces have not abandoned their plans to prepare for war and launch a new world war.

The socialist system has ended capitalist exploitation and established a new life. Socialism has a constantly growing attraction, destroying the old influence of monopoly capital.

(III) The Anti-Colonialist Struggle and the Support of International Workers

The struggle against colonialism has aroused the support of workers in all countries. At present, this solidarity and support has become one of the basic characteristics of the entire international trade union movement.

Since its establishment, the World Federation of Trade Unions has consistently supported workers and people in colonial and semi-colonial countries, with the aim of doing its best to help them defend their democratic and social rights and strive for their immediate daily demands.

The World Federation of Trade Unions has repeatedly called on workers and trade unions in dependent countries and colonial countries and territories to closely integrate their trade union movements with national liberation movements, so that workers and other classes can form alliances with people who are fighting for national goals, especially alliances with peasants.

(IV) Improving the Living and Working Conditions of the Working Class

Since 1953, we have seen significant increases in production and productivity in most capitalist countries, which has led spokespersons for monopoly organizations to call this period a "period of high prosperity."

Behind this capitalist economic development, however, lies a high degree of capital concentration and heavy exploitation of workers aimed at implementing major arms race programs.

The only beneficiaries of this situation are monopoly organizations and large landowners.

Monopoly organizations are waging a propaganda war against workers. Under the capitalist system, the greatest benefits of technological progress always go to monopoly organizations, whose aim is to maximize their class privileges. Therefore, workers and trade unions must actively fight against the malicious propaganda put forward by monopoly organizations.

(V) The Growth of World Trade Union Activities and the Necessity of Struggle and Unity of the Working Class

The social characteristic of the post-war period is the growth of organized labor movements throughout the world. The number of organized workers worldwide has reached an unprecedented high. Currently, 160 million men and women manual and mental laborers are organized in many trade union organizations.

The World Federation of Trade Unions reaffirms that unified action by trade unions and subsequent local, national and international trade union unity can be achieved without first proposing ideological conditions, which often lead to intolerable discrimination. The practical basis for worker solidarity is the consistency of their class interests. This truly demonstrates that it is possible to achieve local, national and international unity.

In the past two years, consistent international action has been established among the national trade unions attending the International Labor Conference in Geneva. Representatives of national trade unions affiliated with the World Federation, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Catholic Trade Union Federation, or not affiliated with any international organization, have gathered annually at the International Labor Conference; this fact strongly demonstrates the possibility of expanding international trade union ties and striving for international consistent action by trade unions.

(VI) On Infringements of Workers' Trade Union Rights, Striving to Expand Trade Union Rights and Democratic Life in Trade Unions

The Charter of Workers' Trade Union Rights was adopted by the Seventh Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council in Warsaw in December 1954.

This document is still valid in principle and remains relevant.

When the roundabout tactics of workers' struggles become so complex that they are difficult for capitalist monopoly organizations to cope with, they openly attack trade union rights and the most militant trade union organizations. This policy is a special infringement of trade union rights, and at the same time is an open action by employers and governments to incite and deepen the division of trade unions. Therefore, wherever the trade union movement is divided, efforts to win respect for trade union rights, to make their foundations more solid, and to enable trade union organizations to operate in a democratic manner are inseparable from the support of workers and trade unions for unified action.

(VII) Economic Development and Social Progress in Socialist Countries

In the years since "the Third Congress," workers in socialist countries have each achieved new and outstanding achievements in the development of the national economy. The living standards of urban and rural residents in socialist countries are constantly improving.

This construction work (to which trade union organizations are closely related) is not an easy task. Trade union organizations in socialist countries also frankly acknowledge its difficulties. They have put forward suggestions and plans to overcome these difficulties.

The huge plan implemented by the Soviet Union to reorganize its economic regions is the most typical example of the spirit of innovation and creative determination.

The fact that trade unions in socialist countries have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions has increased the Federation's prestige and responsibilities.

(VIII) The Contributions of Trade Unions and Workers to the Cause of Defending Peace

Defending peace is a matter directly related to all levels of the people, not just to the members of trade unions.

Trade unions must strengthen their activities to defend peace.

Joint efforts to promote a broad movement to strive for disarmament are in the highest interests of all trade unions, regardless of which international trade union organization they belong to.

(IX) Develop Friendly Contacts and International Relations Among All Trade Union Organizations to Rebuild the Unity of the International Trade Union Movement

The workers themselves demand that the trade union strength of the entire working class be used in broad solidarity internationally to counter the international groups established by capitalist monopoly capital for united action and exploitation.

In order to achieve this goal, which is fully in line with the interests of the workers, the World Federation of Trade Unions has repeatedly made proposals to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Catholic Trade Union Federation, suggesting that discussions be held with them to study ways of acting that are in the highest interests of the working class and give their struggles the most effective international support.

At the present stage, national organizations, whether they belong to an international organization or not, must strengthen their ties with each other.

In order to make further progress in this regard, exchange of delegations should be organized in a planned manner, and at the same time, general trade unions from different international organizations should organize talks on specific issues in order to seek ways to eliminate any misunderstandings that are detrimental to the establishment of new international ties, and to create a new atmosphere among general trade unions from different international organizations.

The road to international trade union unity is through the struggle of the workers. It is necessary to convince workers of the necessity of international trade union unity, in order to mobilize them to actively participate in this unified movement that must be carried out worldwide.

The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions suggests to "the Fourth Congress" to issue an appeal to all national trade union organizations, calling for joint consultations in order to determine a minimum action program acceptable to all trade union organizations in all countries. It will include:

	(1) International trade unions take joint action on the current demands of workers;

	(2) Create conditions for the establishment of a single world trade union organization.

All those who support the restoration of international trade union unity, wherever they are, will play their role in establishing a truly international trade union charter for men and women workers around the world.

    世界工会第四次代表大会报告提纲
    据新华社20日讯　世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬为世界工会第四次代表大会第一项议程准备了报告提纲，供在各国工人中间进行讨论。提纲摘要如下：
    世界工联第十四届执行委员会会议（1957年7月24—27日举行）规定将于1957年10月4—15日在来比锡举行的世界工会第四次代表大会（以下简称“四大”）议程如下：
    （1）关于世界工会的活动和关于为了提高工人生活水平、争取工人的经济、社会与民主权利、争取裁军、和平与民族独立而发展国际工会运动的友好联系和团结的报告。
    （2）工会在反对殖民主义斗争中的任务。
    （3）经费审查委员会的报告。
    （4）国际工人团结基金管理委员会关于它的活动、它所取得的经验以及它对国际团结的进一步发展所能起的帮助作用。
    （5）关于修改世界工联章程的建议。
    （6）选举世界工联的领导机构和经费审查委员会。
    自从1953年10月在维也纳举行世界工会第三次代表大会（以下简称“三大”）以来，各国工人阶级已获得了新的丰富经验，对整个工会运动都是十分宝贵的教训。
    “四大”的任务是把由世界各地千百万男女工人在斗争中所得到的经验，进行分析、研究和比较，并且对其成果作出估价。
    “四大”的首要目的是成为一次团结大会，一次进行广泛和友好讨论的国际会议。它必须帮助确定在各国内和国际范围上开展工人阶级统一行动的方式方法。
    它必须帮助建立新的和更广泛的国际工会联系。
    （一）事实证实了世界工会第三次代表大会各项决议的正确性
    “三大”提出资本主义垄断组织正在加紧实施他们剥削工人的政策。
    “三大”提出了工人有可能团结起来，各派工会必须共同行动，因为它们都表达着共同愿望。
    关于保卫和平，“三大”宣布它赞成协商的政策，反对在各国关系方面推行实力政策，而不论这些国家的政治和社会制度如何。
    “三大”重申了世界工联反对殖民主义剥削的主张。它特别号召全世界工人，支持各国人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义和结束殖民地制度的斗争。
    “三大”建议大大扩展各派工会和各国总工会之间国际联系，而无任何歧视。
    这就是“三大”以来世界工联所采取的行动路线，形势的发展再次证明，三大的决议是符合工人和各国人民的利益和愿望的。将于1957年10月在来比锡举行的第四次代表大会，也将以这种精神进行筹备工作。
    （二）国际形势发展的估计
    国际形势发展的特点是，帝国主义遭受着一系列明显的失败，而人民力量则大大加强。
    垄断组织的帝国主义扩张，大大受到各国人民反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争限制。而以尊重每个国家的权利、互不干涉内政、新型的国际合作、反对一切政治和种族歧视作为各国关系的基础的一种新型政策，则越来越深入人心。
    各帝国主义国家和各国家集团之间争夺市场的斗争日益猛烈。
    帝国主义势力并没有放弃他们准备战争和发动新的世界大战的计划。
    社会主义制度已经结束了资本主义的剥削，建立了新的生活。社会主义具有一种不断增涨的吸引力，它摧毁着垄断资本的旧影响。
    （三）反殖民主义的斗争和国际工人的支援
    反对殖民主义的斗争已经唤起了所有国家的工人支援。目前，这种团结支援已成为整个国际工会活动的基本特点之一。
    世界工联自成立以来，一贯支持殖民地和半殖民地各国工人与人民，目的在于尽力帮助他们保卫其民主和社会权利，并争取其切身的日常要求。
    世界工联一再号召附属国家和殖民地国家及领地的工人与工会，把其工会运动与民族解放运动紧密结合起来，使工人与其他阶层为民族目的而进行共同斗争的人民建立起联盟，尤其要与农民建立联盟。
    （四）改善工人阶级的生活和劳动条件
    1953年以来，我们看到在大多数资本主义国家中生产和生产率有了重要的提高，这就使垄断组织的发言人将这时期叫做“高度繁荣的时期”。
    在这资本主义经济发展的幕后，却隐藏着旨在实行重大的军备竞赛计划的资本高度集中和对工人的沉重剥削。
    从这种情况下，取得利益的只是垄断组织和大地主。
    垄断组织正对工人进行宣传战。在资本主义制度下，技术进步的最大好处总是归垄断组织，它们的目的在于最大限度地保证自己的阶级特权。因此，工人们和工会必须积极地同垄断组织提出的恶毒宣传斗争。
    （五）世界工会活动和工人阶级斗争的成长和统一的必要性
    战后的社会特征是世界各地的有组织工人运动的成长。全世界有组织的工人数字空前高涨。目前已有一亿六千万男女体力和脑力劳动者组织在许多工会组织中。
    世界工联重申，可以达成工会的统一行动以及随后达成地方的、全国的和国际的工会统一，而无需要先提出思想性质的条件，这种思想性的条件往往会导向不可容忍的歧视行动。工人团结的实际基础就是他们阶级利益的一致性。这一点就能真正说明，达成地方性、全国性和国际性的统一是有可能的。
    近两年来，出席日内瓦国际劳工大会的各全国性工会之间建立了一致的国际行动，属于世界工联、国际自由工联、天主教工联或不属于任何国际组织的全国性工会代表，每年在国际劳工大会上聚首；这一事实就有力地表明扩大工会的国际联系和争取工会的国际一致行动的可能性是存在的。
    （六）关于侵犯工人的工会权利，争取扩大工会权利和工会民主生活
    工人的工会权利宪章是在1954年12月，世界工联理事会第七次会议在华沙通过的。
    该文件至今在原则上仍有效，而且依旧适合时宜。
    当工人斗争的迂回策略复杂到使资本主义垄断组织难以应付时，他们就公开进攻工会权利和最富有斗争精神的工会组织。这种政策乃是对工会权利的特别侵犯，同时又是雇主和政府煽动和加深工会的分裂的公开行动。因此，凡是工会运动分裂的地方，争取尊重工会权利、使其基础更巩固以及使工会组织能依民主方式进行工作的努力，是和工人和工会支持统一的行动分不开的。
    （七）社会主义国家的经济发展和社会进步
    “三大”以来的几年中，社会主义国家的工人各自在国民经济的发展中获得了新的突出的成就。社会主义各国城乡居民生活水平不断提高。
    这种建设工作（工会组织和它是有密切关系的）不是一件轻而易举的任务。社会主义各国的工会组织也坦白地承认它的艰巨性。他们已提出建议和方案来克服这些困难。
    苏联为重新组织其经济区域而执行的巨大计划就是革新精神和创造性的决心的最为典型的例子。
    社会主义各国的工会加入了世界工联这一事实，增加了工联的威信和责任。
    （八）工会与工人对保卫和平事业的贡献
    保卫和平是和人民的各阶层直接有关系的事情，不仅仅有关工会会员的部分。
    工会必须加强其保卫和平的活动。
    共同努力以促进争取裁军的广泛运动，是符合一切工会的最高利益的，无论它们参加哪个国际工会组织。
    （九）开展所有工会组织之间的友好联系和国际关系来重建国际工会运动的统一
    工人们自己要求用整个工人阶级的工会力量在国际上的广泛团结，去对抗资本主义垄断资本为了联合行动和剥削而建立起来的国际集团。
    为了达到这个完全符合工人利益的目标，世界工联曾数次向国际自由工联及国际天主教工联提出建议，建议同他们举行会谈，以研究出符合工人阶级的最高利益和给予他们的斗争以最有效的国际支持的行动的方式。
    在目前阶段中，各全国性组织，不论它们加入哪个国际或不属于任何国际组织，必须增强彼此的联系。
    为了在这方面获得进一步的进展，应该有计划的组织交换代表团，同时组织参加不同国际组织的各国总工会就具体问题进行会谈，以便寻求办法，以消除一切有害于建立新的国际联系的任何误解，并且在加入不同国际组织的各国总工会之间造成一种新的气氛。
    通向国际工会统一的道路是要经过工人的斗争的。有必要说服工人认识到国际工会统一的必要性，以便发动他们来积极参加这个必须在世界范围内进行的统一运动。
    世界工联执行委员会向“四大”建议，对所有的全国性工会组织发出一个呼吁书，号召举行共同协商，以便确定一个可以为一切国家的一切工会组织所接受的最低行动纲领。它将包括：
    （1）国际工会对工人当前的要求进行联合行动；
    （2）为建立一个单一的世界工会组织创造条件。
    一切支持恢复国际工会统一的人，不论他们在那里，均将对建立一个全世界男女工人的真正国际工会统一宪章发挥他们的作用。
