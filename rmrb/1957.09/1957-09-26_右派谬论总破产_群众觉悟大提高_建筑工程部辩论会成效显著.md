Right-wing Fallacies Bankrupt; Mass Awareness Greatly Enhanced
Debate Meeting at the Ministry of Construction Engineering Achieves Significant Results

This newspaper reports that the anti-rightist struggle in the Ministry of Construction Engineering has achieved a major victory. After more than two months of face-to-face debate, dozens of rightists, including Li Shuchun, Wu Zhibao, Zhong Xusheng, and Xing Tai, have bowed their heads and admitted their mistakes in the face of facts and truth. Currently, the vast majority of staff are continuing to engage in debate with rightists such as engineer Liu Shucang and technician Lu Xianglin, who have not yet recognized their mistakes. With the deepening of the struggle, more than 20 rightists and some right-wing cliques have been exposed in the last 20 days.

Because the ministry resolutely and fully mobilized the masses in the struggle, it not only dealt a severe blow to the rightists but also profoundly educated the broad masses. The main battlefields for each unit to fight against the rightists were, in addition to organized big-character posters, primarily debate meetings and criticism meetings. In order to strike at the vital points of the rightists, many comrades searched for information and read documents from various aspects. Some speech outlines were repeatedly studied and revised, some were supplemented and revised as many as nine times, so many speeches were well-reasoned and very brilliant.

Li Wenping, a rightist element in the Architectural Science Research Institute and a henchman of Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu in the engineering and technical field, once viciously incited discord between the Party and intellectuals, advocated the implementation of "expert politics" and "a grand alliance of democratic parties," and said that intellectuals and democratic parties were "one family," and that they would have more say after joining the democratic parties, and so on. This conspiracy and fallacy have now been thoroughly exposed and refuted by the broad masses. For example, engineer Xia Shuncan said: Rightists deliberately create a false impression, portraying democratic parties as agents and organizers of intellectuals. Now, the vast majority of intellectuals, including those who have joined democratic parties, are leaning towards the Communist Party. We are not commodities and do not need anyone to act as brokers. If intellectuals are revolutionary, why can't they directly offer opinions to the Party? If they believe that after the democratic parties unite, they can coerce the Party, they should know that the Kuomintang, which once possessed an army with eight million American-equipped soldiers and millions of party members, has never been able to force the Communist Party to accept its coercion. He warned the rightists: "Don't even think about getting any benefit from such speculative deals."

When refuting the fallacy of Kong Fanxi, an engineer at the Beijing First Industrial Architecture Design Institute, that "the Party cannot lead science and technology" and "restore the old architectural firms," many designers from Design Institute 1 and 2, such as Wang Dazun, specifically analyzed the past profit-seeking, technically conservative, and irresponsible practices of the old architectural firms, pointing out that the capitalist "old architectural firms" simply cannot meet the needs of today's large-scale construction and that this is a dark and absolutely dead end. Chief Engineers Hua Guoying, Tao Yizhong, and others also refuted the rightists' arguments by comparing the new and old societies and listing the facts of the great achievements made in China's design work since liberation, such as the training of a large number of design cadres, the rapid improvement of technical levels, the extensive adoption of new technologies, the fact that we could not do industrial building design in the past, but now we have begun to independently design large factories, and so on. Through these powerful refutations, the broad masses of designers realized that only by strengthening the Party's leadership over the design departments and resolutely crushing the fallacies of the rightists can the rapid development and improvement of design work be further promoted.

At the large and small criticism meetings held by the Design General Bureau, the fallacy of Chen Dingwai, a rightist, who exaggerated that "the first five-year plan wasted 10 billion yuan, all caused by the Communist Party," was sharply criticized. For example, Zhang Qinnan, after analyzing China's construction achievements and shortcomings in its work, pointed out that in recent years, the Party has continuously advocated increasing production and practicing economy, and has carried out a resolute struggle against waste, and the achievements are well known. Some of the waste in the past was mainly due to inexperience. The Communist Party is seriously examining past waste in order to avoid future waste. Who in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, has ever examined their shortcomings and summarized their experiences and lessons in this way to their own people? Doesn't this precisely illustrate the Party's selflessness and its high degree of responsibility to the country and the people?

Due to the mobilization of the masses and the deepening of the struggle, the ministry has uncovered sixteen small cliques organized by rightists such as Zhang Qingyun, section chief of the Technical Department of the Design General Bureau and a Communist Party member, and Shen Kuixu, deputy chief engineer of the Design Institute, with a total of more than 80 members. Some were entirely composed of rightists. Some were manipulated by rightists. These small cliques engaged in rumors and slander, inciting discord, and attacking progress overtly and covertly. After more than two months of arduous struggle, most of the small cliques have now been disintegrated.

Through the anti-rightist struggle, the political awareness of the broad masses of cadres is being raised. In the past, many intermediate masses who did not care about politics, held the view of relying on technology for food, "specialized before red," and were unwilling to criticize people face to face and had various concerns have changed to some extent and have begun to participate in the face-to-face struggle with the rightists. In the struggle, a large number of activists with firm positions and resolute struggles emerged. Recently, eight engineers from the Design General Bureau, including Zheng Weihuang, Yang Peilin, and Bao Jinxiang, have joined the Communist Party.

### 右派谬论总破产　群众觉悟大提高  建筑工程部辩论会成效显著

    右派谬论总破产　群众觉悟大提高
    建筑工程部辩论会成效显著
    本报讯　建筑工程部反右派斗争已获得重大胜利。经过两个多月面对面的说理斗争，已有李树椿、吴之宝、钟旭升、邢泰等数十名右派分子在事实和真理面前低头认错。目前广大工作人员正对工程师刘潄沧、技术员鲁祥麟等还没有认识自己错误的右派分子继续进行说理斗争。随着斗争的步步深入，在最近二十天内又有二十多名右派分子和一些右派小集团被揭发出来。
    由于这个部在斗争中坚决、充分地发动了群众，因而不但给了右派分子以狠狠地反击，并且使广大群众受到了深刻的教育。各单位同右派分子作战的主要战场，除了有组织的大字报以外，最主要的是辩论会、批判会。为了击中右派分子的要害，许多同志从多方面搜查资料，阅读文件，有些发言提纲曾经反复研究和修改，有的补充修改九次之多，因而很多发言有理有据，十分精彩。
    章伯钧、李伯球在工程技术界的爪牙、建筑科学研究院右派分子李温平，曾经恶毒地挑拨党和知识分子的关系，主张实行“专家政治”、“民主党派大联合”，并说知识分子和民主党派是“自家人”，加入民主党派之后有更大的发言权，等等。这种阴谋和谬论，现在已被广大群众彻底揭穿和驳倒。如工程师夏舜参说：右派分子故意制造出一种错觉，把民主党派说成是知识分子的代理人和组织者。现在绝大多数知识分子，连同加入民主党派的知识分子在内，都是靠拢共产党的。我们并非商品，用不着谁来作经纪人。知识分子如果是革命的，为什么不能直接向党提意见？如果认为民主党派联合起来以后，就可以对党进行要挟，需知曾经拥有八百万美式装备的军队和千百万党员的国民党，在什么时候能够强制过共产党接受它的挟持？他警告右派分子：“休想在这种投机买卖上揩到什么油水”。
    设计一院、二院在驳斥北京第一工业建筑设计院工程师孔繁熹的“党不能领导科学技术”“恢复旧建筑事务所”谬论时，许多设计人员，如汪达尊等，具体分析了过去旧建筑事务所唯利是图、技术保守、不负责任等恶劣情况，指出资本主义的“旧建筑事务所”根本不能适应今天大规模建设的需要，这是一条阴暗绝顶的死胡同。华国英、陶逸钟等总工程师还通过新旧社会的对比，列举了解放以来我国设计工作获得巨大成就的事实，如大批设计干部的培养，技术水平的迅速提高，新技术的大量采用，过去不会搞工业建筑设计，到现在已开始能独立进行大型工厂的设计等等来反驳右派的论点。通过这些有力的辩驳，广大设计人员认识到，只有加强党对设计部门的领导，坚决粉碎右派分子的谬论才能更加促进设计工作的迅速发展和提高。
    设计总局举行的多次大型和小型批判会上，对右派分子陈定外大肆渲染的“第一个五年计划浪费一百亿元，都是共产党造成的”的谬论，进行了尖锐的批判。如张钦楠在分析了我国建设成就和工作中的缺点以后，指出，几年来，党不断地提倡增产节约，对浪费现象进行了坚决的斗争，成绩是人所共知的。过去有些浪费主要是没有经验。共产党认真检查过去的浪费，是为了避免今后的浪费。古今中外，有谁向自己的人民这样检查过自己的缺点，这样总结过经验教训呢？这不正恰恰说明党的大公无私和对国家对人民高度负责的精神吗？
    由于发动了群众，斗争的深入，该部已查出十六个由设计总局技术处科长共产党员张庆云和设计院副主任工程师沈奎绪等右派分子组织的小集团，成员共八十余人。有的全为右派分子所组成。有的被右派分子所操纵。这些小集团，明着一套、暗里一套，进行造谣污蔑，挑拨离间，打击进步。经过两个多月的艰苦斗争，大部分小集团现在已经分化瓦解。
    通过反右派斗争，广大干部的政治觉悟正在提高。过去不关心政治，抱着凭技术吃饭、“先专后红”的人，以及不愿当面批评人和具有各种各样顾虑的许多中间群众，已经有不少的人有所转变，开始参加同右派分子面对面的斗争。在斗争中，涌现了大批立场坚定、斗争坚决的积极分子。最近，设计总局已有郑维煌、杨沛霖和鲍锦祥工程师等八人加入了共产党。
