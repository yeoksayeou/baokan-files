Luo Feng and Bai Lang Colluded with Ding Chen to Attack the Party
Luo Feng Slandered the Revolution with Ding Ling in Yan'an as Early as Possible

At the meeting, the facts of Luo Feng, Bai Lang, and Ding Ling's collusion in anti-Party activities were also revealed. Ding Ling, Luo Feng, and Bai Lang were often together, exchanging information and plotting how to attack the Party. Luo Feng, in his capacity as the branch secretary and in the name of assisting the Party Group of the Writers Association in dealing with the Ding-Chen issue, systematically deceived the Party Committee of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to obtain information about the Ding-Chen issue. Immediately after, Bai Lang tipped off Ding Ling, and Ding Ling launched a series of attacks on the Party based on the situation.

In 1955, the Party criticized Luo Feng and others for their anti-Party words and deeds. Although they verbally admitted some mistakes at the time, they harbored resentment against the Party. During the rectification campaign, Luo Feng and Bai Lang took advantage of the opportunity of the rightists' attack, and cooperated with Ding and Chen to attack the Party.

Luo Feng's anti-Party behavior was not accidental, and it also has its historical origins. In 1941, after Luo Feng arrived in Yan'an, he slandered the Yan'an literary and art circles under the leadership of the Party as being worse than the KMT-ruled rear areas. He said: "The style of squeezing and suppressing in Yan'an's literary and art circles is not inferior to that of the rear areas, but the difference is that there is superficial harmony, but behind the scenes, rumors are spread and slanders are made, not only between the Party and non-Party members, but also within the Party."

In 1942, after Ding Ling published "Wild Lily" and "Thoughts on March 8th" in the literary and art section of the "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an, Luo Feng wrote an article "Still the Era of Essays," which was also published in the Liberation Daily through Ding Ling's efforts. In this article, he slandered Yan'an as "terrible darkness" and the existence of "nauseating and vicious sores." He called on writers to use the short sword of essays to attack the Party and the people in the revolutionary base areas in difficult times. He praised Ding Ling's published articles such as "Wild Lily," saying: "Comrade Ding Ling, the editor of 'Literature' (referring to the literary and art section of 'Liberation Daily'), once attempted to revive it (referring to essays)." And said that he "thought it was too weak," that is, "Wild Lily" and the like were not enough, and he hoped that "'Literature' would become a 'short sword' that made people tremble."

The meeting has been held twenty-three times until August 31. After the nineteenth meeting, the following people continued to speak at the meeting: Hua Junwu, Cao Ming, Li Ji, Xu Chi, Gong Mu, Mao Xing, Wei Junyi (joint speech by seven people), Ge Yang (joint speech with Hu Kao), Sha Ou, Qin Zhaoyang, Tian Jian (joint speech with Kang Tuo and Xing Ye), Gu Ligao, Cui Yi, Jing Yandun, Jia Ke, Chang Min, Yang Shuo, Xiao San and other forty-eight people. In his speech, Xiao San made a self-criticism of his mistakes in his relationship with Ding Ling. At the meeting, everyone expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the lack of basic sincerity in the reviews of Li Youran, Luo Feng, Ai Qing, and others. The meeting is still in progress.

    罗烽白朗串通丁陈向党进攻
    罗烽早在延安时就同丁玲一唱一和诽谤革命
    会上，还揭露了罗烽、白朗和丁玲勾结进行反党活动的事实。丁玲和罗烽、白朗经常在一起，交换情况，谋划如何向党进攻。罗烽以支部书记的身份，以协助作家协会党组处理丁、陈问题为名，有计划地向中共中央宣传部党委骗取到有关丁、陈问题的情况后，马上由白朗给丁玲通风报信，丁玲便根据情况，向党发出一连串的进攻。
    1955年，党曾批评了罗烽等人的反党言行，当时他们虽然口头上承认了一部分错误，但对党却怀恨在心。整风期间，罗烽、白朗趁右派进攻的时机，和丁、陈配合，向党攻击。
    罗烽的反党行为，并不是偶然的，也有他的历史渊源。1941年，罗烽到延安后，他诽谤党领导下的延安文艺界比国民党统治的大后方还坏，他说：“延安的文艺界挤和压的作风比之大后方并不逊色，但不同的是表面上的一团和气，背地里却造谣中伤，不但党与党外如是，党内亦莫不是这样。”
    1942年，丁玲在延安“解放日报”文艺版上，发表了“野百合花”、“三八节有感”后，罗烽写了一篇“还是杂文的时代”，经丁玲的手也发表在解放日报上。在这篇文章中，他诬蔑延安是“可怕的黑暗”和存在着“使人呕心的恶毒的脓疮”。他号召作家用杂文的短剑，向处在困难时期的革命根据地的党和人民进行攻击。他称赞丁玲发表的“野百合花”等文，他说：“‘文艺’（指‘解放日报’文艺版）编者丁玲同志曾企图使它（指杂文）复活过。”并说他还“嫌它太弱了一些”，就是说“野百合花”之类还不够份量，他希望“‘文艺’变成一把使人战栗”的“短剑”。
    会议到8月31日为止，已举行了二十三次。第十九次会议后，在会上继续发言的有：华君武、草明、李季、徐迟、公木、毛星、韦君宜（七人联合发言）、戈扬（和胡考联合发言）、沙鸥、秦兆阳、田间（和康濯、邢野联合发言）、古立高、崔毅、井岩盾、贾克、厂民、杨朔、萧三等四十八人。萧三在他的发言中对自己在和丁玲的关系上的错误作了自我批评。会上，大家对李又然、罗烽、艾青等的检讨缺乏起码的诚意，表示极为不满。会议仍在继续进行。
