Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The preparations for launching socialist ideological education in universities and colleges in the capital during the new academic year are largely complete.

    Most schools plan to carry it out in three stages: The first stage is mobilization, where the heads of the Chinese Communist Party committees in each school will deliver reports, mobilize teachers and students to discuss the significance and purpose of socialist ideological education, and summarize the experiences of the anti-rightist struggle within the school. The second stage is the mass debate, where each school and department will organize discussions based on common problems existing among students, with Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the central teaching material. The third stage is to mobilize the masses to conduct self-examination and summarize the gains from the study.

    Regarding the teaching methods for socialist ideological education, each school has determined that mass debate will be the main form, supplemented by inspirational reports and reading documents.

    Currently, the Party committees of each school have established specialized organizations to lead this teaching, and the documents and reference materials for students to read and study have also been compiled.

    The teachers of each school will also participate in the study of this socialist ideological education.

    The political instructors, who bear the main task in this socialist ideological education, have already conducted some political study during the summer vacation. They all participated in the report meetings held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and more than two hundred political instructors also participated in a ten-day study session held by the Higher Education Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

    北京高等学校社会主义教育准备工作就绪
    教学计划分三阶段进行　大辩论是主要教学形式
    据新华社讯　首都各高等学校在新学年开展社会主义思想教育的准备工作已经大体就绪。
    大多数学校的计划是分三个阶段来进行：第一阶段是动员，由各校中共党委负责人作报告，发动师生讨论社会主义思想教育的意义和目的，并且总结校内反右派斗争的经验。第二阶段是大辩论，各校各系将根据学生中间存在的共同性问题组织讨论，以毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演为中心教材。第三阶段是发动群众进行自我检查，总结学习收获。
    关于社会主义思想教育的教学方法，各校确定以大辩论为主要形式，以启发报告、阅读文件等为辅助形式。
    现在各校的党委已经成立了领导这一教学的专门机构，供学生阅读和学习的文件、参考材料也已经汇编完毕。
    各校的教师也将参加这次社会主义思想教育的学习。
    在这次社会主义思想教育中担负主要任务的政治课教师，暑期已经首先进行了一些政治学习。他们都参加了中共北京市委举办的报告会，另有二百多名政治课教师还参加了中共北京市委高等学校委员会举办的为期十天的学习会。
