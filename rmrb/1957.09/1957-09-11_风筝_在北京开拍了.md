“The Kite” Begins Filming in Beijing
By our reporter Liu Shiping

\tYesterday morning, as the children of Fuyou Street Primary School in Beijing were boating, playing, and fishing in front of the Five Dragon Pavilions in Beihai Park, four Chinese children suddenly appeared, leading two innocent French children around the park. They were holding hands, looking around as if searching for something, but because they didn't understand each other's language, no one knew what they were thinking.

\tWhen these six Chinese and French children walked hand-in-hand to Xiaoxitian, they suddenly spotted a little girl, Zhou Peiqin, intently fishing on the embankment. The two Chinese children in the lead, Li Wen and Wu Meiying, were overjoyed. They immediately let go of the French boy, Biero’s, hand, and quietly crept up, as if playing hide-and-seek, behind Zhou Peiqin and patted her on the back. Zhou Peiqin was startled and turned around to see that it was her classmates. They happily pointed to Biero and his sister, Nicolette, and said that they had just arrived in Beijing from France and were looking for a Chinese friend. Because of the language barrier, they wanted Zhou Peiqin to translate for them. Zhou Peiqin quickly stood up, put on her sandals, took Li Wen and Wu Meiying's hands, and hurriedly ran over. She spoke to Biero in French and learned that he had come to China to find a little girl named Song Xiaoqing. Excited, she and the others shook hands, ready to go find Song Xiaoqing.

\tThis is a scene from the first day of filming "The Kite," a color children's story film co-produced by Chinese and French filmmakers in Beijing.

\tThey only filmed one scene that morning. The reason is that most of the Chinese and French child actors participating in this film were experiencing the life under the spotlight for the first time. Among them, only Xie Tian, who plays the owner of a Chinese antique shop in Paris, is a professional actor, and Zhang Chunhua, a famous Peking Opera actor, plays the Monkey King. According to French director Roger Pigault, the three French child actors who came to China were selected through radio broadcasts, with specific criteria. Patrick Te Terna, who plays the male lead Biero, is only twelve years old this year and indeed has freckles, just like the protagonist conceived in the story. Sylviane Rosenberg, who plays Biero's sister, is only five and a half years old. She loves Chinese toys and always carries a Chinese handmade velvet bird.

\tThe story of this film is co-written and directed by Roger Pigault and Wang Jia Yi. Although the plot has a basic outline, the details and lines are being enriched and developed during the actual filming. The second part of the story is expected to be filmed in China within six to eight weeks. The second part of the story begins with the French children, Biero and his sister Nicolette, arriving in Beijing and looking for Song Xiaoqing. Because they are visiting China for the first time and don't speak the language, with the enthusiastic help of Chinese children, they finally find Zhou Peiqin (played by Hua Weimin, who volunteered to participate, and grew up in France), a little girl who understands French, in Beihai Park. Finally they find Song Xiaoqing at the Temple of Heaven, where he is flying kites with countless other children. It turns out it was a dream. Later, Biero woke up and wrote another letter, hung it under the kite, and released it, letting it help them find friendship.

\tAt the end of the story, the kite flies high in the blue sky, flying far away with the white dove, symbolizing peace.

\tWhen filming of this film began yesterday, Chinese and French filmmakers set off firecrackers to celebrate the friendship of this collaboration and to mark the start of filming.

　　“风筝”在北京开拍了
　　本报记者　刘时平
    昨天一清早，北京府右街小学的孩子们正在北海五龙亭前划船、游戏、钓鱼的时候，突然有四个中国小朋友带着两个天真烂漫的法国儿童在公园里兜圈子，只见他和她们手拉着手东张西望，好像在寻找什么似的，可是由于相互之间不懂话，又不知他和她们想些什么？
    当这六个中法两国的小朋友相亲相爱地手牵着手走到小西天时，忽然发现海边上有一个小女孩周佩琴正在堤岸上凝神钓鱼，走在前面的两个中国孩子李文和吴美英喜出望外，马上放开了法国小朋友比埃罗的手，放轻了脚步，慢慢走过去，就像是捉迷藏一样，走到周佩琴的背后，拍了她一巴掌。周佩琴吓了一跳，连忙转过头来一看，原来是她的同学。她们一见面就高兴地指着比埃罗和他的妹妹尼古勒说，他们是刚从法国来北京的，要找一个中国小朋友，因为语言不通，想让周佩琴给翻译一下。周佩琴赶快站起来，穿上了凉鞋，拉着李文和吴美英的手，急忙跑过去，用法国话和比埃罗交谈，才知道他到中国来，是要找一个名叫宋小清的小朋友，于是她和他们就兴奋地握起手来，准备去找宋小清。
    这就是中法两国电影工作者合作摄制的彩色儿童故事片“风筝”在北京第一天开拍的一个镜头。
    这天上午，他们只拍了一个镜头。原因是参加这个片子的中法两国的男女小演员，大都是初次尝试水银灯下的生活，其中，只有饰演巴黎中国古玩店主的谢添是职业演员，演孙悟空的是京剧名演员张春华。据法国导演罗奇·比果说，来中国的三个法国小演员，是他在广播电台广播中，提出了具体的条件物色到的。饰演男主角比埃罗的派特里克·特·巴尔地纳今年只有十二岁，脸上果然有雀斑，和故事中所构思的主角一样。演比埃罗妹妹的茜尔维也纳·罗森堡今年只有五岁半，她很爱中国的玩具，手里总是拿着一个中国手工做的绒鸟。
    这个影片的故事，是由罗奇·比果和王家乙共同编导的，剧情虽然有了一个轮廓，但情节和台词都是在实地拍摄中再加以充实发展。预计在六个礼拜到八个礼拜内在中国拍完第二部分。故事的第二部分是从法国小朋友比埃罗和他的妹妹尼古勒到北京后找宋小清开始的。因为他们都是第一次来中国，语言不通，在中国小朋友的热情帮助下，终于在北海找到了一个懂法文的小朋友周佩琴（饰这个演员的华卫民是自动报名参加的，她从小生在法国），最后在天坛找到了宋小清，他正与无数的小朋友在天坛放风筝。原来这是一场梦。后来比埃罗醒来又写了一封信，挂在风筝底下，放了出去，让它去帮助他们寻找友谊。
    故事结尾时，风筝高飞在蔚蓝的天空，它与象征和平的白鸽一起飞向远方。
    昨天开拍这部影片时，中法两国的电影工作者为了庆祝这次合作的友谊，特鸣放鞭炮举行开拍仪式。
