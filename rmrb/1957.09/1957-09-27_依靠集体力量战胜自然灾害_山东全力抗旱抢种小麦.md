Relying on Collective Strength to Overcome Natural Disasters
Shandong Makes Every Effort to Fight Drought and Rush to Plant Wheat
(Our newspaper's dispatch from Jinan) Currently, the drought is seriously threatening autumn planting in various parts of Shandong Province. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on the entire party to mobilize and go all out, making the concentrated effort to combat drought and sow seeds the central task at present.

Since August, most areas of Shandong have been sunny and without rain, and the drought situation has become increasingly serious. In most counties and districts of the Liaocheng, Heze, and Jining regions, there has been no rain for forty to fifty days, and the soil is dry to a depth of about one foot in severely affected areas. According to statistics from relevant provincial departments, more than 45 million mu out of the province's more than 100 million mu of late autumn crops such as corn, peanuts, and sweet potatoes have been affected, with yields reduced by 15%-20% in mildly affected areas, 40% or 50% or more in severely affected areas, and some farmland experiencing crop failure. The total planned wheat planting area in various regions was 63 million mu, but as of the 21st, only 30.06 million mu had been plowed, and only 8.57 million mu had been sown, accounting for 13.6% of the plan. If it does not rain recently, it is estimated that the province can only plant about 36 million mu of wheat (including irrigated planting), accounting for 57% of this year's wheat planting plan.

At present, in order to strive for as much increased production as possible, especially to make the greatest determination to strive to plant all wheat well in a timely manner, the Shandong Provincial Committee requires party committees at all levels to mobilize the entire party and go all out to quickly make drought resistance to protect autumn planting, especially the concentrated effort to combat drought and sowing, an urgent central task, and all other tasks should be subordinate to this central task; all relevant departments should vigorously support wheat planting. The province's stock of 360,000 waterwheels is being supplied to the masses on credit for drought resistance and wheat planting.

At present, the work of drought resistance to protect autumn planting and wheat planting in some areas has begun to form a upsurge. The Liaocheng and Huimin local committees have organized more than 1,000 cadres to go to the countryside and go deep into agricultural cooperatives to carry out the struggle against drought and planting. The secretary and members of the Jiyang County Party Committee have gone deep into the fields to lead the masses in fighting drought day and night to rush to plant wheat; in areas where the drought is relatively serious, measures such as ditching, leveling ridges, and watering before plowing are being adopted. According to statistics from the entire county as of the 17th, more than 380,000 mu of land had been plowed, and more than 336,000 mu had been sown, including nearly 12,000 mu of irrigated planting. However, some areas are still waiting for rain before planting, which has affected the progress of the current drought resistance and wheat planting work. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference of local committee secretaries on the 24th, further instructing party committees at all levels to seize the leadership of drought resistance and rush planting, and change the slow progress of drought resistance and wheat planting work in some areas.

    依靠集体力量战胜自然灾害
    山东全力抗旱抢种小麦
    本报济南电　目前，干旱严重地威胁着山东省各地的秋播。中共山东省委号召全党动员、全力以赴，把突击抗旱播种作为当前中心的工作。
    8月以来，山东大部地区天晴无雨，旱情日益严重。聊城、菏泽、济宁等专区大部分县、区有四十至五十天没下雨，土壤干旱重者深达一尺左右。据省有关部门统计，全省一亿多亩玉米、花生、地瓜等晚秋作物，已有四千五百万亩遭灾，轻者减产15％—20％，重者减产40％或50％以上，部分农田失收。各地原计划种麦面积共六千三百万亩，到21日只耕起三千零六十万亩，已种上麦的仅八百五十七万亩，占计划的13.6％。如最近仍不下雨，估计全省只能种麦三千六百万亩左右（包括浇水种麦），占今年种麦计划的57％。
    目前，为了争取尽可能增产，特别是下最大决心力争适时种好全部小麦，山东省委要求各级党委要全党动员、全力以赴，迅速把抗旱保秋种麦，尤其是把突击抗旱播种作为一项紧急的中心任务，其他各项工作均应服从这一中心任务；各有关部门要大力支援种麦。全省库存的三十六万部水车，正采取赊销办法，供给群众用以抗旱种麦。
    目前部分地区抗旱保秋种麦工作，开始形成热潮。聊城、惠民等地委均组织了一千多干部下乡，深入农业社开展抗旱播种斗争。济阳县委书记、县委委员们，深入田间领导群众日夜抗旱抢种小麦；对旱情比较严重的地方，采取开沟、整畦子和泼水后耕种。全县至17日统计，已耕地三十八万多亩，播种三十三万六千多亩，其中水种近一万二千亩。但也有些地区仍在等雨下种，影响了当前抗旱种麦工作的进展。为此，省委特于24日召开了各地委书记电话会议，进一步指示各级党委会抓紧领导抗旱抢种，改变部分地区抗旱种麦工作迟缓的情况。　（山东记者站）
