Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 6th: Syrian Minister of State and Acting Minister of Defense, Azem, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the afternoon of September 5th, spoke about the recent aggressive activities of US special envoy Henderson in the Middle East, saying, "Any attempt by the United States to impose any kind of blockade on Syria will fail because we are determined to defend ourselves with all our strength, and all free countries will support us."

Regarding the recent Soviet notes to the US, British, and French governments on the Middle East situation, Azem said, "We thank the Soviet government for reaffirming that it will not remain silent if imperialism attempts new aggression against Syria."

Speaking about the current relations between Arab countries, Azem said, "We believe that, in general, the Arabs are one nation, with the same feelings, and the same desire to defend their independence, but some Arab governments in power use force and various other pressures to prevent the true feelings of their people from being expressed." Azem expressed his belief that the barriers that are dividing the Arabs will one day be eliminated.

Speaking of the friendship between the Arab world and China, Azem said, "The Arab nation sees China as a brotherly country. The strong relationship between the Arab world and China cannot be undermined by anyone." He said that Syria always stands with People's China and hopes that China will regain its seat in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 6th: Egyptian Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Ali Sabri, said in an exclusive interview with Middle East News Agency reporters on September 5th that Syria's security and independence are part of Egypt's security and independence. Egypt will stand with the Syrian people and the Syrian government to thwart the imperialist conspiracy.

He pointed out that the imperialists are desperately trying to achieve in Syria what they could not achieve in Egypt. They have not accepted the lessons learned in Egypt. He said that the recent "visit" to the Middle East by US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson is the same type of conspiracy that the United States carried out against Egypt after Egypt purchased arms from Czechoslovakia in 1955. As long as independent countries remain united, they will not be shaken by such conspiracies.

    叙利亚代理国防部长发表谈话
    美国封锁叙利亚企图注定失败
    萨布里表示埃叙将一起挫败侵略阴谋
    据新华社大马士革6日电　叙利亚国务部长兼代理国防部长阿泽姆9月5日下午在单独接见新华社记者时，就美国特使汉德逊最近在中东的侵略活动发表谈话说：“美国想对叙利亚加以任何一种封锁的任何企图都将失败，因为我们决定用我们所有的一切力量来保卫我们自己，而且一切自由的国家将支持我们。”
    阿泽姆谈到苏联最近就中东局势问题提交美英法政府的照会时说：“我们感谢苏联政府重新保证，如果帝国主义企图对叙利亚实行新的侵略，它不会保持沉默。”
    在谈到目前阿拉伯国家之间的关系时，阿泽姆说：“我们认为，一般地说，阿拉伯人是一个民族，有同样的感情，有同样的保卫他们的独立的愿望，但是，某些当政的阿拉伯政府用武力和其他各种压力不让它们的人民的真正感情表现出来。”阿泽姆表示相信，正在分化阿拉伯的障碍有朝一日将被消除。
    谈到阿拉伯与中国的友谊，阿泽姆说：“阿拉伯民族把中国看做兄弟国家。阿拉伯与中国之间的牢固关系是任何人所不能破坏的。”他说，叙利亚始终和人民中国站在一起，并且希望中国将恢复它在联合国的席位。
    据新华社开罗6日电　埃及总统事务国务部长阿里·萨布里9月5日在单独接见中东通讯社记者时说，叙利亚的安全和独立是埃及的安全和独立的一部分。埃及将同叙利亚人民和叙利亚政府站在一起来挫败帝国主义的阴谋。
    他指出，帝国主义分子拼命想在叙利亚取得他们在埃及所不能取得的东西。他们没有接受在埃及所得到的教训。他说，美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊最近在中东的“访问”是同1955年埃及向捷克斯洛伐克购买军火之后美国对埃及进行过的同一类型的阴谋。只要独立国家保持团结一致，它们将不为这种阴谋所动摇。
