Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 24th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Zilin reports: On a map of the People's Republic of China at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, covered with small red flags, it shows that the domestically produced Liberation brand automobiles, only one year old, have already traveled across the country.

From the shores of the South China Sea to the oil fields of the Northwest, from the heavy industrial center of the Northeast to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the green forests of the Southwest, batches of Liberation brand automobiles are busy serving the country's socialist construction and the people's economic life.

The personnel in charge of sales at the First Automobile Factory told reporters that since the factory began production in the second half of last year, more than 5,590 trucks have been distributed to more than 60 provinces and cities across the country.

Since the beginning of this year, the First Automobile Factory has also produced a large number of auto parts for the national transportation departments and local auto repair shops. This has played a significant role in modifying new cars and reviving old cars nationwide. Currently, cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Qingdao have used Liberation brand automobile chassis to modify domestic variant vehicles such as buses, trolleybuses, fire trucks, and sprinklers. Eight provinces, including Guangxi, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are also using domestically produced automobile chassis and engines to modify long-distance passenger buses. Cities such as Xining and Lhasa, which never had buses in the past, now also have domestically produced buses modified from Liberation brand automobiles.

    解放牌汽车驰遍全国
    据新华社长春24日电　新华社记者陈子林报道：在第一汽车制造厂的一张插满了小红旗的中华人民共和国挂图上，表示着诞生只有一周年的国产解放牌汽车已经遍驰全国各地。
    从祖国的南海之滨到油田千里的西北，从重工业中心的东北到西南的青藏高原和绿山林海之间，都有成批的解放牌汽车在为国家社会主义建设和人民的经济生活奔忙着。
    第一汽车厂负责销售工作的人员对记者说，这个厂从去年下半年投入生产以来，已经有五千五百九十多辆载重汽车分配到全国六十多个省市。
    今年以来，第一汽车厂还为国家交通运输部门和各地汽车修配厂生产了大批汽车配件。这对全国改装新汽车、复活旧车起了很大的作用。目前上海、天津、北京、青岛等城市，已经用解放牌汽车底盘改装成公共汽车、无轨电车、消防车、洒水车等国产变型汽车。广西、江苏、山东、河南、河北、山西、陕西、甘肃等八个省和内蒙古自治区，也都正在用国产汽车底盘和发动机，改制长途客车。西宁、拉萨等过去从来没有公共汽车的城市，现在也有用解放牌汽车改装成的国产公共汽车了。
