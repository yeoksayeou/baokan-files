A Batch of Books Introducing Beijing

    To welcome National Day, Beijing People's Publishing House published "Tiananmen" and "Beijing's Poems" before National Day. The former narrates Tiananmen's long history and instances of feudal emperors issuing edicts and conducting autumn trials there, up to the grand occasions of the people celebrating festivals there after liberation; it introduces the beautiful architecture of Tiananmen and provides in-depth explanations of its details. The latter selects passionate eulogies of new things and beautiful scenery in Beijing by more than forty poets, including Guo Moruo and Zang Kejia.

    Prior to this, the publishing house had successively published some books introducing Beijing. The "Beijing" pictorial, published in October of last year, used more than one hundred and forty photographs to introduce the significant changes in the capital since liberation. The "Beijing Tourist Handbook," published in April of this year, provides a relatively complete introduction to Beijing's cultural relics, historical sites, parks, scenic spots, cultural and recreational activities, and transportation. Also published were "The Yongding River Water Comes to Beijing" (pictorial) and "Bringing the Yongding River Water into the Capital," which describe how this frequently flooding river (originally named the Wuding River) was conquered by the people, realizing a thousand-year-old dream.

    The publishing house will soon publish "I Love New Beijing" and "Yuanmingyuan." The former is a collection of lyrical essays by writers such as Lao She and Cao Yu describing Beijing; the latter introduces the construction and heyday of Yuanmingyuan, a world-famous 17th-century garden known as the "Garden of Gardens," and its tragic burning and plundering. Also to be published are large-format color illustrations of "Beijing's Famous Scenic Spots" and "A Guide to Beihai," which are finely depicted Beijing scenes using traditional Chinese painting, with photos attached to the illustrations; and "A Beijing Street," "Beijing Library," etc. will also be published.

    Beijing was the capital of the Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Since liberation, it has become even more magnificent, splendid, and prosperous day by day. People, especially tourists, hope to understand how this ancient feudal consumer city has been transformed into a new and vibrant production city. This batch of books introducing Beijing from Beijing Publishing House will contribute to this understanding.

    一批介绍北京的书籍
    为迎接国庆，北京人民出版社在国庆节前夕出版了“天安门”、“北京的诗”二书。前者述叙了天安门久远的历史和封建帝王在此颂诏、秋审等事例，直到解放后人民在此欢庆节日的盛况；介绍了天安门美丽的建筑，并深入解说细部。后者选录了郭沫若、臧克家等四十多个诗人对北京新事物以及美妙景色的热情洋溢的歌颂。
    在此以前，该社已经陆续出版了一些介绍北京的书籍。去年10月出版的“北京”画册，用一百四十多幅照片介绍了解放以来首都的重大变化。今年4月出版的“北京游览手册”，比较完全地介绍了北京文物古迹、公园名胜、文娱交通等。已经出版的还有“永定河水到北京”（画册）、“把永安定水引进首都”，描述了这条经常泛滥成灾的河（原名无定河）如何被人民征服而实现了千年的理想。
    该社即将出版的还有“我热爱新北京”、“圆明园”。前者是作家老舍、曹禺等描述北京的抒情散文选集；后者介绍了我国十七世纪一座闻名世界的被称为“万园之园”的圆明园的兴建、全盛时的面貌和它惨遭焚掠的经过。还将出版的有大幅彩色画图的“北京名胜图”和“北海导游图”，这是用国画精细地描绘的北京景色，图上附有照片；还有“北京一条街”、“北京图书馆”等等也将出版。
    北京曾是辽、金、元、明、清历代帝都，解放后日新月异地变得更宏伟、壮丽、繁荣了。人们特别是游客希望了解这座封建古老的消费城市怎样变成新进的年轻的生产城市，北京出版社的这批介绍北京的书籍，有助于这种了解。
