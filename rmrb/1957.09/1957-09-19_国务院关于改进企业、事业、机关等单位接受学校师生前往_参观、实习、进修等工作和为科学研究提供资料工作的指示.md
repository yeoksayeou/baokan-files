(I)
    It is an important step in improving the level of teaching and scientific research, as well as an effective way for school teachers and students to study the country's construction work on the ground and to closely connect with the lives of workers and peasants, for teachers and students of universities and secondary specialized schools to go to enterprises, institutions, government agencies, etc. for visits, internships, advanced studies, and to participate in scientific and technological cooperation and necessary scientific and technological conferences. In recent years, the state's business departments, factories, mines, construction sites, design departments, scientific research institutions, etc. have provided many conveniences and support to teachers and students in this regard, so that visits, internships, and other work have achieved certain results. It is completely appropriate to stipulate some necessary confidentiality systems in visits, internships, and other work. However, because some confidentiality scopes were not clearly defined in the past, some regulations were too broad, and many units' review procedures for personnel going for visits, internships, advanced studies, etc. were too cumbersome, so that some personnel who needed to go to enterprises, institutions, government agencies, etc. for visits, internships, and advanced studies were not approved when they could have been, or the time was delayed too long; some approved personnel also encountered some unnecessary restrictions during the visits, internships, and advanced studies. This reduced their opportunities to connect with reality and affected their enthusiasm for work and study. In order to improve this situation, the following instructions are given:
    1. All teachers and students of universities and secondary specialized schools, except for counter-revolutionaries, controlled elements, personnel under investigation for counter-revolutionary suspicion, and elements with serious anti-socialist words and deeds, should generally be allowed to visit, intern, and pursue advanced studies in certain enterprises, institutions, government agencies, etc. according to their majors and the courses they teach, if there is a real need. When they are conducting visits, internships, and advanced studies, the receiving units should take an active and helpful attitude and should regard this work as an important task, rather than as an extra burden. The necessary labor tools, test materials, labor protection products, dormitories, and other working and living conditions required by school teachers and students during their advanced studies and internships should be actively assisted in solving; when conflicts arise between factories and mines training technicians and students' internships, overall arrangements should be made to appropriately take care of students' internship requirements. On the other hand, personnel going for visits, internships, and advanced studies should respect the business guidance of the receiving units, abide by the working system and labor discipline of the receiving units, and shall not hinder the production and daily work of the receiving units.
    2. In order to clarify the scope of confidentiality and change the past situation where some confidentiality scopes were too broad, and to facilitate the work of school teachers and students going for visits, internships, and advanced studies, the central business departments and the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should re-demarcate the scope of confidentiality and the level of secrecy for their subordinate factories, mines, construction sites, design departments, and scientific research institutions. According to the current actual situation, all factories, mines, construction sites, design departments, and scientific research institutions can be divided into three categories. The first category is a very small number of special confidential units. These units generally do not accept people being sent to visit, intern, and pursue advanced studies. The second category is several important units. Personnel going to these units for visits, internships, and advanced studies shall undergo political review by the sending unit before being sent out. The third category is ordinary units. Personnel going to these units for visits, internships, and advanced studies will no longer undergo political review if they are qualified. The specific classification list shall be quickly verified and issued to subordinate units by the central business departments in accordance with the spirit of this instruction, notified to the relevant people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, and reported to the State Council for record.
    3. In order to simplify review procedures, all personnel going to enterprises, institutions, government agencies, etc. for visits, internships, and advanced studies do not need to send their personnel archive materials to the receiving units. The receiving units generally do not conduct political reviews on them, but can conduct spot checks when necessary. The Higher Education Department and the relevant central or local business departments should urge the subordinate sending units to be responsible for conducting this review work on the personnel sent for visits, internships, and advanced studies, and to strengthen the education of these personnel on maintaining state secrets. If accidents such as leakage of secrets or sabotage occur during visits, internships, and advanced studies, the sending unit shall conduct an inspection; the receiving unit may put forward opinions to the sending unit and may notify the leading organs of the sending unit to handle it. In terms of dispatch procedures and the number of dispatched personnel, in the future, in addition to students who will still be handled in accordance with the original regulations of the Higher Education Department and the central or local business departments, other personnel shall be directly contacted and introduced by the sending unit to the receiving unit, and will no longer be subject to review and approval by their leading departments. The Higher Education Department and relevant departments should urge subordinate schools and grass-roots units to establish regular contacts with relevant enterprises, institutions, government agencies, etc. nearby, and encourage them to sign scientific and technological contact contracts or production internship contracts.
    4. When central and local relevant business departments and factories, mines, and design departments hold specialized scientific and technological conferences, they should actively invite relevant scientific and technological personnel and school teachers to participate; when scientific research institutions and schools hold conferences to discuss relevant scientific and teaching issues, they should also invite engineering and technical personnel from relevant factories, mines, and design departments to participate, so as to exchange advanced production experience and scientific research information in a timely manner.
    5. When scientific research institution staff members go to relevant enterprises, institutions, government agencies, etc. for visits, surveys, and investigations due to work needs, they may be handled with reference to the above provisions.

(II)
    In order to do a good job in the preservation of materials, and also to improve the work of providing materials for scientific research, the central business departments are required to actively carry out the following tasks in addition to dividing the scope of confidentiality and actively improving the material work in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's (56) Guo Mi Xi Zi No. 284 notice:
    1. The central business departments should gradually establish a set of material management systems. In view of the fact that this work is very complex and there is a lack of experience, the central departments should designate a vice minister or assistant minister to be responsible for guiding this work. When determining the level of secrecy of materials, careful consideration should be given, and materials that are not "top secret" should not be classified as "top secret." In fact, the materials that should really be classified as "top secret" only account for a very small number of all materials, and some materials should only be classified as "top secret" for a certain period of time, and after a certain period of time, they are no longer "top secret" or even "secret." Therefore, business departments and subordinate units should implement a system of checking confidential materials once a year or every few years, so as to change the level of secrecy of some materials in a timely manner.
    2. The central business departments should quickly strengthen the existing material rooms. If there is no material room, a material room should be established according to needs, or a special person should be designated to manage this work. At present, it is necessary to quickly start clearing up the materials accumulated over the years, and to carry out the cataloging of various types of materials. The catalog of materials that can be used for scientific research and teaching reference should be printed and distributed to relevant units for reference at any time. At the same time, simple and feasible methods for borrowing materials should be developed to facilitate personnel engaged in scientific research to borrow materials according to certain procedures. This method should strive to both maintain state secrets and ensure the full utilization of materials. The Science Planning Commission of the State Council should immediately, in conjunction with relevant units, consider how to establish a supply center for technical and economic materials for scientific research, and submit a plan to the State Council for review and approval.
    3. In order to supply necessary materials to scientific researchers, engineering and technical personnel, and school teachers and students more widely, the central departments may periodically publish relevant yearbooks or material compilations, etc., but only those with a large amount of demand, greater reference value, and systematically organized materials should be published, to prevent the phenomenon of rampant publishing.
    4. The relevant central and local business departments and factories, mines, construction sites, design departments, and research institutions should improve the supply of materials to school teachers and students who go to visit, intern, pursue advanced studies, and participate in scientific and technological cooperation, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's (56) Guo Mi Xi Zi No. 284 notice and this instruction. In principle, personnel who go for production internships and participate in scientific and technological cooperation should be allowed to consult and excerpt relevant materials within the scope and procedures stipulated, within the scope necessary for their internships or participation in scientific and technological cooperation, with the status of staff members of the receiving unit. At the same time, the sending units should educate the dispatched personnel, requiring them to conscientiously abide by the state's confidentiality system. All universities and secondary specialized schools should conscientiously organize and utilize the materials that have been requested from various enterprises, institutions, government agencies, etc. over the years, and all schools should also do a good job in exchanging materials, so as to avoid repeated requests as much as possible and reduce the burden on relevant units.
    5. In view of the increasing number of engineering projects designed domestically in the future and the gradual development of scientific research work, the State Construction Commission should organize the exchange of materials and formulate feasible systems and methods as soon as possible.

(III)
    The relevant state departments, universities, secondary specialized schools, and scientific research institutions should regularly educate relevant personnel to make them pay attention to the fact that when carrying out the above-mentioned tasks, they must both eliminate the phenomenon of complacency and leakage of state secrets, and overcome the phenomenon that some confidentiality scopes are too broad, which affects scientific research and teaching work. Ignoring either aspect is wrong.

　　国务院关于改进企业、事业、机关等单位接受学校师生前往
    参观、实习、进修等工作和为科学研究提供资料工作的指示
　　（一）
    高等学校和中等专业学校师生，前往企业、事业、机关等单位进行参观、实习、进修和参加科学技术合作工作与必要的科学技术会议，是提高教学和科学研究水平的重要环节，也是学校师生实地研究国家各项建设工作，密切联系工农群众生活的一个有效办法。近几年来，国家各业务部门、各厂矿、工地、设计部门、科学研究机关等单位，在这一方面，曾给各校师生不少的便利和支持，使参观、实习等工作取得了一定的成绩。在参观、实习等工作中规定一些必要的保密制度，是完全应当的。但是，由于过去保密范围有些规定不够明确，有些规定过宽，许多单位对于前往参观、实习、进修等人员，审查手续过于繁琐，以致一部分需要前往企业、事业、机关等单位进行参观、实习、进修的人员，可以批准的而没有被批准，或者时间拖得过久；有些被批准的人员，在参观、实习、进修的过程中，也曾遇到过一些不必要的限制。这样就减少了他们联系实际的机会和影响了他们工作学习的积极性。为了改进这种状况，现作如下指示：
    一、凡是高等学校和中等专业学校的师生，除了反革命分子、被管制分子和因为有反革命嫌疑正在审查中的人员和有严重反社会主义言行的分子以外，在确实有需要的情况下，一般都应当按照他们所从事的专业和所教学的课程，允许他们到一定的企业、事业、机关等单位去参观、实习和进修。当他们在进行参观、实习和进修的时候，接受单位应当采取积极帮助的态度，应当把这个工作作为一项重要的任务，而不应当看做是一种额外的负担。对于学校师生在进修、实习期间所必需的劳动工具、试料、劳动保护品、宿舍等项工作和生活方面的条件，应当积极协助解决；在遇到厂矿培养技工和学生实习发生矛盾的时候，应当统筹安排，适当地照顾学生的实习要求。另一方面，前往参观、实习、进修的人员，应当尊重接受单位的业务指导，遵守接受单位的工作制度和劳动纪律，不得妨碍接受单位的生产和日常工作。
    二、为了明确保密范围和改变过去某些保密范围过宽的状况，便利学校师生前往参观、实习和进修的工作，中央各业务部门、各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，应当把所属厂矿、工地、设计部门、科学研究机关，重新划清保密范围和机密等级。按照现在的实际情况，所有厂矿、工地、设计部门、科学研究机关，可分为三类。第一类是为数很少的特殊机密单位，这一类单位，一般不接受派人前往参观、实习和进修。第二类是若干重要单位，前往这一类单位进行参观、实习、进修的人员，由派出单位在派出前负责进行政治审查。第三类是普通单位，前往这一类单位参观、实习、进修的人员，凡合格者，不再进行政治审查。具体分类名单，由中央各业务部门根据本指示精神迅速核定下达所属单位，通知有关省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，并且报国务院备案。
    三、为了简化审查手续，所有前往企业、事业、机关等单位进行参观、实习、进修的人员，派出单位都不必把他们的人事档案材料寄往接受单位。接受单位对他们一般不进行政治审查，但必要时可进行抽查。关于是项审查工作应当由高等教育部和中央或者地方有关业务部门督促所属派出单位对派往参观、实习、进修的人员负责进行，并且对这些人员加强关于保守国家机密的教育。如果在参观、实习、进修期间发生失密、破坏等事故，派出单位应当进行检查；接受单位可以向派出单位提出意见，并且可以通知派出单位的领导机关，给予处理。在派遣手续和派遣人数方面，今后除了学生仍旧按高等教育部和中央或者地方各业务部门的原规定办理以外，其他人员一律由派出单位向接受单位直接接洽介绍，不再经过他们的领导部门审查批准。高等教育部和有关部门，应当督促所属学校和基层单位就近同有关企业、事业、机关等单位建立经常的联系，并且提倡它们之间订立科学技术联系合同或者生产实习合同。
    四、中央和地方有关业务部门以及厂矿、工地、设计部门举行专门的科学技术会议的时候，应当主动地邀请有关科学技术人员和学校教师参加；各科学研究机关和学校在举行讨论有关科学和教学问题会议的时候，也应当邀请有关厂矿、工地、设计部门的工程技术人员参加，及时交流先进生产经验和科学研究情报。
    五、科学研究机关工作人员，因为工作需要，前往有关企业、事业、机关等单位进行参观、调查和考察的时候，可以参照上列各项规定办理。
    （二）
    为了作好资料保管工作，同时也为了改进给科学研究提供资料的工作，要求中央各业务部门除了按照国务院（56）国秘习字二八四号通知的精神，划分保密范围、积极改进资料工作以外，还应当积极地进行下列几项工作：
    一、中央各业务部门，应当逐步建立起一套资料管理制度。鉴于这个工作十分复杂，而且经验不足，中央各部门应当指定一个副部长或者部长助理负责指导这个工作。在确定资料机密等级的时候，应当经过缜密考虑，不应当把不是“绝密”的资料列入“绝密”范围。事实上，真正应当列入“绝密”等级的资料，在全部资料中，只占极少数，而且有些资料，只在一定时期内，应当列入“绝密”等级，过了一定的时期，就不再是“绝密”甚至不再是“秘密”了。因此，各业务部门和所属单位，对于机密资料应当实行一年或者几年检查一次的制度，以便及时改变一部分资料的机密级别。
    二、中央各业务部门，应当迅速加强现有的资料室。没有设资料室的，应当根据需要成立资料室或者指定专人管理这方面的工作。目前应当迅速着手清理几年积累起来的资料，并且进行各类资料的编目工作。将其中可供科学研究和教学参考用的资料目录，随时印发各有关单位查考。同时着手制定简便可行的资料借阅的办法，以便利进行科学研究工作的人员按照一定手续前往借阅。这个办法应当力求既能保守国家机密，又能保证资料的充分利用。国务院科学规划委员会应当立即会同有关单位，考虑如何建立供科学研究用的技术资料和经济资料的供应中心的问题，提出方案报国务院审核批准。
    三、为了更广泛地为科学研究人员、工程技术人员和学校师生供应必要的资料起见，中央各部门可以定期出版有关的年鉴或者资料汇编等，但要限于需要量较多的，有较大的参考价值并且经过系统整理的资料，防止出版泛滥的现象。
    四、中央和地方有关业务部门和厂矿、工地、设计部门、研究机关，应当按照国务院（56）国秘习字二八四号通知和本指示的精神，改进对前往参观、实习、进修和参加科学技术合作的学校师生的资料供应的工作。对于前往进行生产实习和参加科学技术合作的人员，原则上应当允许他们以接受单位工作人员的身份，在他们进行实习或者参与科学技术合作工作所必需的范围内，按照规定的范围和手续可以查阅和摘录有关资料。同时，各派出单位应当对派出人员进行教育，要求他们切实遵守国家保密制度。各高等学校和中等专业学校，应当将历年已经由各企业、事业、机关等单位索取来的资料，切实加以整理和利用，各校之间也应当做好资料交流工作，以尽可能避免重复索取，减轻有关单位的负担。
    五、鉴于今后在国内设计的工程项目日益增多，科学研究工作逐渐开展，国家建设委员会应当组织资料的交流工作，并且尽速定出可行的制度和办法。
    （三）
    国家各有关部门和高等学校、中等专业学校、科学研究机关，应当经常向有关人员进行教育，使他们注意：在进行上述各项工作的时候，既要杜绝麻痹大意，泄漏国家机密的现象，又要克服某些保密范围过宽，影响科学研究和教学工作的现象。忽视任何一个方面，都是错误的。
