Shehong County Farmers Vigorously Sell Surplus Grain
After receiving socialist education, the farmers in Shehong County, Sichuan Province, have become highly patriotic and are actively selling grain to the state. They have now completed 80% of their public grain task.

This is a scene of members of the Daming Township Agricultural Cooperative loading public grain onto boats, which will be transported along the Fujiang River to the Taihe Town Grain Depot.

    四川省射洪县的农民，经过社会主义教育后，爱国热情高涨，积极交售粮食给国家，现在已完成公粮任务80％。
    这是大明乡农业社的社员们正把公粮装船，由涪江运到太和镇粮库。
