Hanoi, September 8th (via this newspaper's dispatch) - Tonight, a thousand children in Hanoi celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival with their beloved Uncle Ho in the back garden of the Presidential Palace.

Like China, the Vietnamese people have had the custom of celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival for a long time, which later gradually became mainly a children's festival. This year is the third Mid-Autumn Festival after the restoration of peace, and the scene is particularly lively.

President Ho Chi Minh, who had just returned from a visit to nine brotherly countries in Asia and Europe, wrote a letter to the children before the Mid-Autumn Festival to congratulate them on the festival, and conveyed to them the cordial congratulations of the children of the brotherly countries to the Vietnamese children.

Three days before the festival, the children in Hanoi began singing and labor competitions. On the eve of Mid-Autumn Festival, they held a grand lantern, lion dance, and dragon dance parade by Hoan Kiem Lake.

Tonight, as the bright moon had just risen, the children held a get-together in the Children's Palace, squares, and lawns. Thousands of children, representing children from all over the north and south of the country, overseas Chinese children, and foreign children, came to the back garden of the Presidential Palace to pay their respects to Uncle Ho. President Ho distributed bags of sweets to the children, encouraging them to listen to their parents and teachers, strengthen unity, and love the collective and labor. President Ho and the children enjoyed the moon in the garden and watched two interesting animated films.

    胡伯伯和小朋友一起赏月
    本报河内8日专电　今天晚上，河内一千名少年儿童在主席府的后花园里和亲爱的胡伯伯一起欢度中秋节。
    同中国一样，越南人民很早以来就有过中秋节的风习，后来才逐渐变成主要是孩子们的节日。今年是和平恢复后第三个中秋节，景况特别热闹。
    刚从亚洲和欧洲九个兄弟国家访问归来的胡志明主席，在中秋节前写信给少年儿童祝贺节日，并把各兄弟国家的儿童们对越南儿童的亲切祝贺转达给他们。
    节日前三天，河内的少年儿童们就开始了歌咏、劳作等比赛。中秋前夕，他们在还剑湖边举行了盛大的提灯、舞狮、舞龙游行。
  今天晚上，当皓月刚刚升起的时候，孩子们就在少年俱乐部里和各个广场、草坛上举行联欢。上千名少年儿童，代表全国南北各地的小朋友、华侨小朋友和外国小朋友，来到主席府的后花园里向胡伯伯拜节。胡主席把一包包糖果分送给孩子们，勉励大家要听爸爸妈妈和老师的话，加强团结，爱集体，爱劳动。胡主席和孩子们在花园里赏月，并看了两部有趣的动画影片。
