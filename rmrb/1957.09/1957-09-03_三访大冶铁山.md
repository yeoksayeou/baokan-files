Third Visit to Daye Tieshan
By our reporter Cao Baoming

This time is my third visit to Daye Tieshan.

The first time was in the spring of 1951. The Daye Steel Plant's charcoal truck rumbled along the uneven road for a whole morning, before finally bumping us, a group of a dozen people, to our destination. An old worker from the Hanyeping era led us to a hilltop exposing red rock layers. Someone picked up a piece of red sandstone; gosh, it was harder and heavier than a cobblestone! The old worker explained, "This is iron ore." It turned out that some of the iron ore here was exposed on the surface; you could use it to make iron just by breaking it up. The richness of Tieshan really excited us newcomers. Unfortunately, Tieshan had been shut down for six years at that time. Hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore at the foot of the mountain had been mixed by the Japanese invaders into piles of waste rock. We entered the large concrete buildings and saw hundreds of mine cars overturned on the ground, and the steel frames of the crushers were covered with a thick layer of rust. In the Jianshan open-pit mine, the dozens of meters high cut slope blocked the sun, and white sewage flowed everywhere, making it gloomy. We walked around Tieshan for several hours and only saw a student from Beijing sitting on a stone drawing a picture; it was very desolate. At that time, I asked myself, "When will such good resources be able to serve the motherland?"

In April 1953, I visited Tieshan for the second time. This time I went by train from the Daye Steel Plant. Tieshan had changed. The 429 Geological Exploration Team, consisting of more than a thousand people, had been working here for a year. From east to west, drill rig derricks stood on all six mountains in a row. Power lines were also erected along the road. Surveyors and geophysical prospectors carried heavy instruments, trekking between the mountains, lying in the air-polluted tunnels to find outcrops, and setting up observation points. The political instructor told me a story: They needed to build a road to the nearby Jinshandiang, originally planning to mobilize 2,500 people to build it in ten days, but 5,000 peasants poured in, beating gongs and drums, and finished the road in five days. On the day the truck carrying the drilling rig entered the mountain, peasants from all over gathered on both sides of the road to watch. The peasants vacated their best rooms for the workers to live in, and young peasants voluntarily organized themselves to carry water for the drilling rig workers on the mountain.

When I was in Tieshan, it was a time of frequent good news from Tieshan.

On the morning of April 3, Drill Rig No. 28 discovered a new ore body in Jianlin Mountain. The geological team leader told me: A large piece of ore body exposed on the ground was interrupted in Jianlin Mountain. Was there an ore body under Jianlin Mountain? Since the beginning of this century, geologists from the United States, Japan, Britain, and France had come to investigate and wrote many investigation reports, but none of them could answer this question. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the 429 Geological Exploration Team closely coordinated measurement, geophysical exploration, geology, and drilling, and finally found the ore body, and confirmed that the ore bodies of the six mountains in Tieshan were connected as a whole. The resources that have been identified are sufficient for the first phase of the new steel base project.

When I recently went to Daye Tieshan, I saw that the peak of Jianshan had been cut off. It and Lion Mountain had been opened up into layers of large terraces, exposing yellow and gray rock layers of varying shades and some reddish-brown ore bodies, which stood out particularly among the lush green mountains. The electric railway on the mountain also cut the Elephant Trunk Mountain next to it in half, the upper half covered with light green grass, and the lower half was a railway subgrade made of marble blasted out on the spot, a white expanse. At night, the lights of the construction site on the mountain were like bright pearls strung together, some in arcs, some in rectangles, and some winding, like snakes. Among these thousands of lights, there were also some light balls flashing, like shooting stars. These were the lights of cars! Added to the intermittent cannon fire, this night construction scene was truly magnificent and beautiful.

The comrades in charge of Tieshan told me that they were going to strip away the rocks on the three eastern mountains that were pressing on the ore body, and build a huge open-pit mine here. In the future, the exposed iron ore will be crushed by blasting, and then transported by electric train to the ore dressing plant at the foot of the mountain to select the non-ferrous metals and rare metals contained in the ore, and then transported to the factory area along the Wu (chang) Da (ye) railway. Therefore, there are now more than 20,000 people working on construction in Tieshan. Since August 1955, they have stripped more than 2.5 million cubic meters of rock, reducing the elevation of Jianshan from 252 meters to below 216 meters, and also cut off half of Lion Mountain. The Wu Da railway, the regional substation, and the ignition project are also under intense construction.

At the top of the mountain, large electric shovels and drilling machines replaced the former drilling rigs, and the highest Lu Yuling peak was stripped to only a small pile of stones. The large gorge east of Jianshan was filled with waste rock to form a large flat area, on which a transportation workshop and a car repair shop were built.

As soon as we got on the mountain, we encountered mountain blasting. We saw white smoke rising from the construction site in the distance, and then we heard a few loud noises, setting off a black mist, followed by the sound of stones falling like rain. They blasted several places simultaneously each time, dozens of explosions in a row, which was really spectacular. But the guide, a communications worker named Xiao Hua, said, "This is nothing. A big blast is really something!" Once, many tons of explosives were loaded, and people at the foot of the mountain had to retreat two miles away. The blast sounded like muffled thunder, and all the glass windows in the district rattled and shook, the houses were swaying, and a cloud of black smoke suddenly rolled up on the mountain, covering the whole mountain. When the smoke cleared, the mountain was shorter.

On the mountain, I also saw large electric shovels lying on each working surface, three or four zhang high. People could sleep or play poker in the bucket. It grabbed a bucket of stones, weighing ten tons, which could not be completely loaded by a large truck. Who are driving these huge machines? In addition to a few workers from Anshan, they were all young people around the age of twenty who had just graduated from technical schools the year before. This group of young people learned to drive electric shovels, much like the heroine in the movie "Irena Goes Home" learned to drive a car. After being instructed by their masters in class every day, they would lie in bed and stretch their legs and feet after work, imagining themselves operating the electric shovel. After such diligent study and practice, they quickly became electric shovel drivers or assistant drivers, becoming the technical backbone of Tieshan. They will be responsible for mining for a long time in the future.

This time I went to Tieshan, the bus stopped next to a garden, and there was also a spacious department store and many dormitories nearby. These were all newly built in the past one or two years. The comrades from the Tieshan office in Huangshi City also introduced, "Since the year before last, the population here has gradually increased to more than 43,000 people, and more than 40,000 square meters of houses and more than 60,000 square meters of work sheds have been built. This year, 30,000 square meters of dormitories will also be built. It has developed from only one street, Jingcheng Street, in the past to more than ten streets, and from fourteen peddlers to various kinds of living supply units. New middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens, new hospitals, and new cinemas and cultural palaces including libraries, table tennis rooms, open-air movie theaters, and gardens have been built here. Tieshan has developed into a small city larger than ordinary county towns.

Not long after I left Tieshan, I heard that the railway had been built from Wuchang to Tieshan Station. The next time I go to Tieshan, I must take the train from Wuchang.

    三访大冶铁山
    本报记者  曹葆铭
    这一次是我第三次访问大冶铁山。
    第一次是在1951年春天。大冶钢厂的木炭卡车在不平的路上咕噜噜响了一个上午，才把我们十几人颠到目的地。汉冶萍时代的老工人领我们上了一座露着红色岩层的山头，有人拾起块红砂石来，咳，比鹅卵石还硬，还坠手！老工人解释说：“这就是铁矿石。”原来，这里的铁矿有的就露在地面，只要敲碎就可以用来炼铁。富庶的铁山真叫我们这群初来的人兴奋得不行。可惜的是，那时铁山已停工六年。山下有数十万吨铁矿被日寇混杂在废石堆里。我们走进混凝土的大建筑物里，只见成百辆矿车反扑在地上，碎矿机的钢架也长上厚厚一层铁锈。在尖山露天矿场里，数十公尺高的削壁遮住了太阳，遍地流的都是白色的污水，阴森森的。我们在铁山走了几个钟头，只看见一个北京来的学生坐在石上绘图，很荒凉。当时我问自己：“这样好的资源，什么时候才能为祖国服务呢？”
    1953年4月，我第二次访问铁山。这一次是坐大冶钢厂的火车去的。铁山已经变样了。一千多人组成的四二九地质勘探队在这里活动了一年。从东到西一顺溜的六座山上，都矗立着钻机的三角棚架。沿路也架起了电线。测量人员和物理探矿人员背着沉重的仪器奔波在群山之间，伏在空气污浊的坑道里找露头，安观测点。政治指导员给我讲了一段故事：他们需要修条公路到附近金山店，原计划动员二千五百人修十天，但农民敲锣打鼓地涌来了五千人，五天就把路修好。汽车载着钻机进山那天，四乡农民都聚集在公路两旁看。农民们腾出最好的房间给工人住，青年农民自动组织起来给山上的钻机工人挑水。
    我在铁山的时候，正是铁山喜报频传的日子。
    4月3日早晨，二十八号钻机在尖林山钻到了新矿体。地质组长告诉我：大片露出地面的矿体在尖林山中断了，尖林山下有没有矿体呢？从这个世纪开初以来，美、日、英、法的地质学家都来调查过，写了很多调查报告，但都答复不了这个问题。四二九地质勘探队在苏联专家的指导下，测量、物探、地质和钻探密切配合，终于找到了矿体，并证实了铁山六座山的矿体是连成一体的。已经查明的资源，足够新的钢铁基地第一期工程使用。
    我最近到大冶铁山，看见尖山的尖顶已给削去了。它和狮子山都被开成了一层层的大台阶，裸露出深浅不同的黄色、灰色的岩层和部分棕红色的矿体，在葱绿的群山之中显得特别突出。山上的电气铁路也把旁边的象鼻山拦腰截成了两半，上半披着浅绿色的薄草，下半是用就地炸出的大理石堆成的铁路路基，白花花的一片。夜晚，山上工地的灯光就像用线串起来的明珠，有的成弧形，有的成长方形，还有的蜿蜒曲折，像蛇似的。在这万盏灯光之间，还有些光球在闪动，像流星似的，这是汽车的灯光啊！加上一阵紧一阵的炮声，这夜间施工景象真是十分雄伟，十分美丽。
    铁山的负责同志告诉我：他们要把东面三座山上的压在矿体上的岩石剥掉，在这里建成一个巨大的露天矿场。将来，裸露的铁矿石被炸碎后，就由电气火车运到山下选矿厂，挑选出矿石中含的有色金属和稀有金属，然后再沿着武（昌）大（冶）铁路运到厂区。因此，铁山现在有两万多人在施工。从1955年8月起，他们已剥离了二百五十多万方岩石，将尖山由二百五十二公尺标高削到了二百一十六公尺以下，狮子山也削去了半个山头。武大铁路、区域变电站和引火工程也都正在紧张施工。
    在山顶上，大型电铲和穿孔机代替了昔日的钻机，最高的鹿雨岭峰也被剥得只剩下个小石堆。尖山东面的大狭谷则被废石填成了个大平场，上面建起了运输车间和汽车修理场。
    刚上山，就遇见开山放炮。我们在远处望见工地白烟一冒，就听见几声巨响，掀起一阵黑雾，接着是下雨般的石子落地声。他们每次都是几个地方同时放炮，一连几十响，真壮观。但领路的通讯员小华却说：“这不算什么，要大爆破才厉害哩！”一次装上好多吨炸药，山下的人都要退出两里外去，炮像闷雷似的一响，全区的玻璃窗都哗啦哗啦地响，房子在摆动，山上顿时卷起一团团黑烟，笼罩全山。等烟雾消散，山也矮了一截。
    我在山上还看见伏在各个工作面的大型电铲，有三四丈高，人可以在铲斗里面睡觉或坐着打扑克。它抓起一斗石块，有十吨重，一辆大型汽车装不完。什么人在驾驶这些巨大的机器呢？除了几个从鞍山来的工人外，都是前年才从技工学校毕业的二十岁左右的青年。这群年轻人学习驾驶电铲，跟电影“伊伦娜，回家去”里的女主角学驾汽车差不多，每天在班上经师傅指点后，下班来就躺在床上伸腿动脚，在想像中驾驶着电铲操作。经过这样勤学苦练，他们就很快地成为电铲正司机或副司机，成了铁山的技术主力。他们将来还要长期担负采矿的任务。
    我这次到铁山，公共汽车停在一座花园旁边，邻近还有宽敞的百货公司和许多栋宿舍。这都是最近一、二年新建的。黄石市铁山办事处的同志还介绍说：“从前年开始，这里就陆续增加到四万三千多人，建筑了四万多平方公尺房屋和六万多平方公尺工棚，今年还建筑三万平方公尺宿舍。这里已由过去只有经城街一道街发展到十多条街，由十四户小贩发展到有各种各样的生活供应单位。这里还新建了中学、小学、幼儿园，新建了医院，新建了电影院和包括有图书室、乒乓球室、露天电影场和花园的文化宫。铁山已发展成一座比一般县城还大的小城市。
    我离开铁山不久，就听说铁路已由武昌筑到了铁山车站。我下一次去铁山，一定要由武昌搭火车。（附图片）
