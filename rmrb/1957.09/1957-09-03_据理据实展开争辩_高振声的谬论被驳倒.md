    展开ing the Debate with Facts and Reason
    Gao Zhengsheng's Fallacies Refuted

    (Our Dispatch) During the recent preparatory meeting for the Hebei Provincial People's Congress, the representatives refuted and exposed the reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois rightist Gao Zhengsheng.

    Gao Zhengsheng was the Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, as well as the Vice Chairman of the Tangshan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association. During the "blooming and contending" period, he echoed Zhang Naiqi, denying the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie, saying that the wall between public and private was getting higher and higher. He slandered the Party's united front work as completely dark and smeared the Party's proposal of the "good," "more," "fast," and "economical" principles, saying that "even a living god could not do it."

    The representatives all launched debates with him based on facts and reason, denouncing him for describing the united front work as a complete mess, and saying that he was talking nonsense against his conscience. Everyone pointed out that he himself held important positions such as the Vice Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. He should be very clear about the achievements of the united front work and should not fabricate rumors and slanders out of thin air. Li Changfu, a representative of the workers of Zhao Jia Zhuang Coal Mine in Tangshan, pointed out: Before liberation, the daily output of coal from the mine was 3,500 to 4,000 tons, and on average one or two people died every day; after liberation, thanks to the correct implementation of the "good," "more," "fast," and "economical" principles, the daily output of coal has now increased to more than 9,000 tons, and the number of casualties has also been greatly reduced.

    Under the exposure and rebuttal of the representatives, Gao Zhengsheng's trick of boasting about his progress and actively attempting to muddle through was finally bankrupt.

    据理据实展开争辩
    高振声的谬论被驳倒
    本报讯  最近召开的河北省人代会预备会议上，代表们驳斥和揭露了资产阶级右派分子高振声的反动言行。
    高振声是河北省工商联副主委兼唐山市工商联和民建会副主委。他在鸣放期间，和章乃器一鼻孔出气，否认资产阶级的两面性，说公私之间的墙愈来愈高。污蔑党的统战工作一团黑，污蔑党提出“好”、“多”、“快”、“省”的方针，是“活神仙也做不到”的。
    代表们都据理据实同他展开辩论，指斥他把统战工作说成一团漆黑，是昧着良心说黑话。大家指出，他自己身任工商联副主委等要职。统战工作的成绩，他应该十分清楚，不能无中生有造谣污蔑。唐山赵家庄煤矿工人代表李长福指出：解放前该矿煤的日产量是三千五百吨至四千吨，每天平均死一两个人；解放后，由于正确贯彻了“好”、“多”、“快”、“省”的方针，现在煤的日产量已经提高到九千余吨，伤亡事故也大大减少了。
    在代表们的揭发驳斥下，高振声吹嘘自己进步积极，企图蒙混过关的狡计终于破产。
