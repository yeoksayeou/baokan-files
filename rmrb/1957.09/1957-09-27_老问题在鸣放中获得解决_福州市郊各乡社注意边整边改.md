Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 26th: Various townships and communes in the suburbs of Fuzhou are rectifying while reforming, which has increased the enthusiasm of the masses for airing views freely and for production.

In the past, cadres of the Dongmen Vegetable Cooperative subjectively ordered the Sixth Production Team to convert eight fen of paddy field into vegetable gardens. As a result, this eight fen of land was waterlogged for a long time, overgrown with weeds. The cooperative members repeatedly raised this issue with the cooperative, but it was delayed for half a year without being addressed. During this round of airing views freely, the cooperative members raised this issue again. The next day, the cooperative organized fifteen members to go to the fields to remove weeds and tidy the ridges, interplanting mustard greens and potatoes. Because of this, everyone was very happy, and the enthusiasm for airing views became even higher.

    老问题在鸣放中获得解决
    福州市郊各乡社注意边整边改
    据新华社福州26日电　福州市郊各乡、社做到边整边改，提高了群众大放大鸣和生产的积极性。
    东门蔬菜社的干部过去曾主观地叫第六生产队把八分田改成园地，结果这八分田长期积水，荒草满园，社员屡次向社里提意见，拖了半年还没有处理。在这次大鸣大放中，社员再次提出这个意见，第二天社里就组织十五个社员下田除草整畦，间种了芥菜和马铃薯。因此，大家都很高兴，鸣放的热情更高了。
