Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 3rd. According to a report from the German News Agency on September 2nd: The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement warning of the dangerous trend of the resurgence of West German militarist forces in the Baltic Sea.

The statement pointed out: West German and other NATO warships will conduct joint naval exercises in the Baltic Sea in September. U.S., British, French, and West German naval leaders will also hold talks in Kiel at the same time.

The statement emphasized that the strategic position of the West German militarist navy in the Baltic Sea constitutes a constant threat to the Baltic countries—especially Sweden and Norway.

The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that it is necessary for the Baltic countries to declare their willingness to negotiate and conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on developing mutual cooperation.

The statement pointed out that West Germany's purpose in rebuilding its navy is to establish a NATO naval base in the Baltic Sea. This activity is being carried out with the full support of the United States.

The statement said: The West German government has allocated nearly two billion marks for the establishment of its navy, of which 360 million marks will be used to expand the naval bases of Kiel, Flensburg, and Eckernförde on the Baltic coast. Of West Germany's twenty-one naval squadrons, which possess modern weapons such as rockets, thirteen will be stationed in the Baltic Sea.

    构成对波罗的海国家的经常威胁
    新华社柏林3日电　据德意志通讯社2日消息：德意志民主共和国政府发表声明，就西德军国主义势力在波罗的海的再起的危险趋向提出了警告。
    声明指出：西德和北大西洋集团其他国家的军舰将在9月间在波罗的海举行联合海军演习。美国、英国、法国和西德的海军将领同时还要在基尔举行会谈。
    声明强调指出：西德军国主义海军在波罗的海的战略地位构成了对波罗的海国家——特别是对瑞典和挪威——经常的威胁。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为：波罗的海国家有必要宣布愿意进行谈判、并且缔结关于发展互相合作的双边或多边协定。
    声明指出：西德重建海军的目的在于建立北大西洋集团在波罗的海的海军基地。这种活动是在美国的充分支持下进行的。
    声明说：西德政府已经拨出将近二十亿马克用于建立海军，其中三亿六千万马克将用于扩建波罗的海沿岸的基尔、法林斯堡和埃肯弗德的海军基地。在拥有火箭等现代化武器的西德二十一个海军分舰队里，将有十三个分舰队驻扎在波罗的海。
