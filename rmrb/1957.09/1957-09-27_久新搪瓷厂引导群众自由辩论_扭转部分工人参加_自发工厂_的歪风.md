    Jiuxin Enamel Factory Guides the Masses in Free Debate
    Reversing the Unhealthy Trend of Some Workers Participating in "Spontaneous Factories"
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, September 26th, reporter Xi Ping) The Shanghai Joint Public-Private Jiuxin Enamel Factory, through free debate among the workers, reversed the capitalist tendencies of some workers participating in "spontaneous factories," allowing righteousness to prevail and evil to subside.
    In late May of this year, the enamel workshop of Jiuxin Enamel Factory, which had always had good production, and other departments experienced very abnormal phenomena, and the labor discipline of many workers relaxed. The technician Chen Xuanmu, who was originally an active participant in the workers' amateur cultural activities, stopped mentioning cultural activities and always came to the factory and left hurriedly. These suspicious signs aroused the attention of the trade union cadres, who went deep into the masses to inquire and learned that this workshop was being impacted by the capitalist undercurrent of spontaneous factories, and some workers had been pulled by capitalists to participate in the factories. Chen Xuanmu was one of them. He paid a deposit of fifty yuan to the spontaneous factory, and his wife also joined the factory to work. The female worker Wang Caiqin, who was originally a family member of the private sector, was active everywhere in the workshop, spreading rumors and saying, "It's good to make money by opening a factory, it's meaningless to take dozens of yuan of idle wages." The hearts of some workers in the workshop were also shaken, and they wanted to follow the path of Wang Caiqin and Chen Xuanmu. This affected the workers' morale and the factory's production.
    How should we treat this capitalist tendency among some workers? Should we adopt administrative orders or socialist ideological education? The trade union organization of Jiuxin Factory decided to adopt the latter method. The topics for discussion were: What kind of behavior is it for workers and capitalists to jointly operate spontaneous factories? Should workers in employment participate in "spontaneous factories"?
    The focus of the discussion was first concentrated on Wang Haiyan. Wang Haiyan was a worker on the large furnace. Under the enticement of a capitalist, he participated in a spontaneous factory that manufactured faucet elbows with a capital of four hundred and fifty yuan. Wang Haiyan said that he participated in the spontaneous factory because his family was in difficulty and he wanted to earn more money to improve his life, and subjectively he did not want to be a capitalist, so it cannot be considered engaging in capitalism. At first, some people also thought that this was not a big mistake. The workers then brought out many facts and reasons to explain that Wang Haiyan's statement was incorrect. First of all, Wang Haiyan's own life was not difficult. His salary was more than seventy yuan, and he only had a child and a wife. His parents lived in the countryside, and his economic expenses were small. In fact, part of Wang Haiyan's hundreds of yuan of capital invested in the spontaneous factory was withdrawn from bank deposits. The temporary worker Xu Baohua said, "Even if we are really in financial difficulty, we should not do this kind of thing. My monthly salary is only more than forty yuan, and I support the lives of seven people, which is much more difficult than Wang Haiyan, but I will never do the business of spontaneous factories. This is taking the capitalist road, and it is also a dead end." Then the workers said that according to their investigation, the factory that Wang Haiyan colluded with the capitalist to operate was completely an illegally operated factory of a capitalist nature. The factory purchased machines and tools, hired workers to work, and each worker who entered the factory also needed to find a guarantor. Some of these workers were employed workers, which violated government decrees and harmed the socialist cause. Isn't this clearly a capitalist act? In the discussion, some old workers said to Wang Haiyan sincerely with full of enthusiasm: You suffered enough in the old society (Wang Haiyan was originally a child laborer in Jiuxin Factory). When you entered the factory, you were not even as tall as the tabletop. We all saw you being beaten and scolded by the capitalists. Now, after the joint public-private operation of the enterprise, our workers are no longer the capitalists' beasts of burden. How can you forget the past days and go back to the old ways? The workers also cited examples to illustrate the harm of illegally operated spontaneous factories to the country and the erosion of workers. For example, a worker from Shunfeng Enamel Factory stole enamel powder from a state factory under the enticement of a capitalist to engage in a spontaneous factory. A worker surnamed Yao from the blank production workshop of this factory participated in a spontaneous factory, evaded taxes, and was also found to have used other people's invoices illegally. This is such a shameful thing. Some workers sadly recalled that before liberation, every worker who entered the factory had to write a guarantee to the capitalist. This guarantee was like a contract of servitude, and from then on they lost their freedom. After liberation, the factory underwent democratic reforms, and the People's Government took this contract of servitude back from the capitalists and returned it to the workers. We all remember how excitedly we burned this contract of servitude at a general meeting. Now, some people even want to restore this kind of life, how can we tolerate it?
    This debate, through reasoning based on specific events, raised the ideological understanding of the workers throughout the factory. "I am a glorious worker" became a proud sentence. All fifteen workers who participated in the spontaneous factory have voluntarily withdrawn and are actively and securely producing in this factory. The technician Chen Xuanmu's production enthusiasm has also gradually increased. Recently, he assisted in the successful trial production of single-enameled enamel powder. In the second quarter of this year, when the morale of some workers was fluctuating, the factory's quality plan was not completed, but now it has completely turned around. The phenomenon of absenteeism in the factory has been eliminated, and the attendance rate has increased from the original 86% to about 95%, and the production situation has greatly improved.

    久新搪瓷厂引导群众自由辩论
    扭转部分工人参加“自发工厂”的歪风
    本报上海26日电　记者习平报道：上海公私合营久新搪瓷厂通过工人群众的自由辩论，扭转了一部分在业工人参加“自发工厂”的资本主义倾向，使正气抬头，邪气下降。
    今年5月下旬，久新搪瓷厂生产一向很好的搪瓷车间和其它部门，出现了很反常的现象，不少工人的劳动纪律松弛。技术工人陈宣木本来是工人业余文娱活动的积极分子，但从那时起他对文娱活动再也不提了，总是神色匆匆地来到工厂，又匆匆地离开。这些可疑的迹象引起了工会干部的注意，他们深入到群众中一打听，才知道这个车间正被自发工厂的资本主义暗流冲激着，有一部分工人已被资本家拉去参加了工厂，陈宣木就是其中的一个。他向自发厂交了五十元的押金，他的妻子也参加了工厂做工。女工王彩琴，原来是私方人员家属，她在车间里到处活动，风言风语地说：“开厂赚头好，几十元呆工钱拿着无啥意思。”车间里有一部分工人的心也动摇了，想走王彩琴、陈宣木的路。这样就使工人的情绪和工厂的生产都受到了影响。
    应当怎样对待一部分工人中的这种资本主义倾向呢？是采取行政命令的办法，还是采取社会主义思想教育的办法？久新厂的工会组织决定采取后一种办法。讨论的题目是：工人和资本家一起经营自发厂是什么样的行为？在业的工人应不应该参加“自发工厂”？
    讨论的重点首先集中在王海沿的身上。王海沿是大炉上的一个工人，他在一个资本家的引诱下，以四百五十元的股金，参加了一个制造自来水湾头的自发工厂。王海沿说：他参加自发厂是因为家庭困难，想多挣几个钱来改善生活，主观上根本不想做资本家，因此不能算搞资本主义。一开始，有些也认为这不算什么错误。工人们便拿出许多事实和道理，说明王海沿的说法是不对的。首先，王海沿本人的生活并不困难，他的工资有七十余元，只有小孩和妻子二人，父母都住在乡下，经济开支很少。事实上王海沿投入自发厂的几百元股金，其中有一部分就是从银行存款中提取出来的。临时工徐保华说：“我们就是真的生活困难，也不应当干这种事。我每个月工资只有四十余元，负担七口人的生活，比王海沿困难得多，但我决不做自发工厂的勾当，这是走资本主义道路，也是一条死路。”接着工人们又说：据他们调查，王海沿伙同资本家经营的那片工厂，完全是一片资本主义性质的非法经营的工厂，工厂购置了机器和工具，雇佣工人进行劳动，而且每个入厂的工人还需找保具结，这些工人有的是在业的工人，这是违反政府法令，损害社会主义事业的。这不是明明白白的资本主义行为吗？在讨论中，有些老工人怀着满腔的热情，诚恳地对王海沿说：你在旧社会吃足苦头（王海沿原来是久新厂的童工），你进厂时人还没有桌面高，我们都亲眼看到你给资本家打骂，好容易到现在，企业公私合营了，我们工人再不做资本家的牛马了。你怎么竟忘记了过去的日子，又走起回头路了呢？工人们还举例说明非法经营的自发厂对国家的危害，对工人的腐蚀。例如顺风搪瓷厂有个工人，在资本家引诱下偷了国家工厂的珐琅粉去搞自发厂。本厂的制胚厂车间一个姓姚的工人参加的自发工厂，偷税漏税，还查出偷用别人发票的不法行为，这是多么丢脸的事。有的工人沉痛地回忆道：解放前，我们每个工人进厂，要给资本家写一张保书，这张保书就像卖身契一样，从此就失去了自由。解放后，工厂进行了民主改革，人民政府把这张卖身契从资本家手里要回来交还了工人，我们都记得是怎样兴奋地在一次大会上把这张卖身契烧掉的。现在，竟有人又想把这种生活恢复过来，我们怎么能容忍呢？
    这次辩论，就这样通过一件件具体事情的说理，使全厂的工人在思想认识上提高了一步。“我是一个光荣的工人”成了人们自豪的一句话。参加自发厂的十五个工人已全部自愿退出，积极、安心地在本厂生产。技工陈宣木的生产积极性也逐步提高，最近他协助试制单搪珐琅粉得到了成功。在今年部分工人们情绪动荡的第二季度，厂内质量计划没有完成，现在已完全好转。厂内旷工现象已消灭，出勤率由原来86％提高到95％左右，生产情况已大为改观。
