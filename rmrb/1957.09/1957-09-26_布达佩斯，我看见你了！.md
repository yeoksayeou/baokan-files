Budapest, I see you!
——One of the Visit to Hungary Records
Wang Qi
    Budapest! Since that emergency moment last October, people all over the world have been concerned about you. Because the bourgeoisie and counter-revolutionaries attempted to restore capitalism in Hungary and manufactured frightening terrorist incidents. Ten days later (October 23 to November 4 last year), the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, leading the working people who were still bearing the wounds, counterattacked the counter-revolution, and the revolution finally triumphed. All this started from the capital of Hungary—Budapest.
    After a back-and-forth life-and-death struggle of revolutionary regimes, what is the state of Budapest, the heart of Hungary, with a population of two million? Is the Queen on the Danube still as beautiful as she used to be? Here, I would like to quote fragments from my diary just after arriving in Budapest to introduce my initial impressions to the readers.
    June 30: Arrived in Budapest a little after nine o'clock in the morning, and stayed on the largest island in the Danube. This is Margaret Island. In the afternoon, Mibier (Hungarian translator) led me to walk around the island. Rather than calling it an island, it is more like a large garden, full of flowers and trees, with tourists coming and going. Today is Sunday, and there are particularly many people on the island. Bus No. 26 runs from Pest to the island and is always full. Many people bring food with their families early in the morning to the Palatinus swimming pool on the island. Buying a ticket for four forints allows you to play all day.
    The stadium on the island also attracted many people. Hungarians are fond of football and have won excellent awards in several international competitions. When I turned on the radio in the hotel on the island, I only heard a clamor of voices, mixed with applause, laughter, and cheers. Mibier told me: A heated and tense international football match is being held today in the newly built stadium that can accommodate tens of thousands of people.
    We also went to the busiest street in Budapest—Lenin Avenue. This street was the most severely damaged during the counter-revolutionary events of last October. Most of it has now been restored, and only a few houses are still surrounded by scaffolding. The newly repaired houses have facades painted in simple and elegant colors, which look very beautiful from a distance. The shops are closed today as usual. The doors of the shops are closed, but the colorful commodities in the glass windows are very attractive. Mibier said that the Hungarian women's fine wool sweaters, new high-heeled leather shoes, and nylon stockings are very beautiful. Women in Budapest love these high-end products, and they sell out quickly as soon as the stores have them. Sure enough, there were the most people standing in front of the glass windows with these goods. If it weren't for the bullet marks still visible on some of the buildings on the street, how would one imagine that the fiercest battles had taken place here?!
    When we returned to the island, we passed the Margaret Bridge connecting Buda and Pest. We stood on the bridge and looked into the distance. The towering castle-style ancient buildings on Buda Hill are one after another; the small bungalows in the green trees on the hillside are looming, very beautiful. The Parliament Building facing the Danube is as solemn as a crown. Its towering spires set off the rows of tall buildings in Pest, making them look short. The beautiful Danube, carrying arrow-like small boats, flows quietly under the bridge. How much I wanted to say loudly: Budapest, I see you!
    To understand today's Budapest, one must know Budapest during the counter-revolutionary events of October. Please see another excerpt from my diary on the second day of my arrival in Budapest.
    July 1: We visited the exhibition of counter-revolutionary events in October today. Most of the materials in this exhibition are photos and news reports provided by Western journalists and newspapers. A large part of the photos were left behind in this way: Western journalists and some unidentified people who came to Hungary during the October events originally wanted to present these photos as their "brilliant achievements" to their masters. However, the counterattack of the revolution was too swift, and they could not take these photos away, so they fell into the hands of the people.
    This is truly a record of great terror, great reaction, and great barbarism. There is a photo in the exhibition: a group of counter-revolutionaries beat a public security soldier to death, tied his feet with a rope, and a counter-revolutionary dragged the corpse, while other counter-revolutionaries stood by, reveling in their inhumane act.
    In front of one of the largest bookstores in Budapest, the streets were full of books thrown out of the bookstore, and the streets had simply become rivers of books. The counter-revolutionaries were burning these books. This is also a photo exhibited in the exhibition of counter-revolutionary events in October. The counter-revolutionaries were using the banner of Petőfi, the greatest poet in Hungary, but they also burned Petőfi's poetry collections.
    I also saw the evidence of the atrocities of the counter-revolutionaries with my own eyes. One day, the comrades who accompanied us led us to a building in front of Republic Square. The entire building was destroyed, and every inch of the wall had bullet holes. This was the office building of the heroic past municipal party committee. There is a row of trees in front of the building, and some of the tree trunks have turned white. The comrades who accompanied us said that because the counter-revolutionaries rushed into the municipal party committee, grabbed many Communist Party members and public security soldiers who were defending the municipal party committee, hung them upside down on the trees, and burned them alive, burning all the bark. Now this building is being repaired and will become a museum of the counter-revolutionary events in October.
    In Budapest, traces of the counter-revolutionary events of October can be found anytime and anywhere. The Parliament Building is the most eye-catching building in the entire city of Budapest. It was built from 1885 to 1904 and is very famous in Europe. After liberation, the Hungarian Central People's Government was located here. The entire Parliament Building is magnificent and exquisite. The central cylindrical hall is entirely built of marble. The spire of the hall is the tallest building in the city. Passing through the hall, it leads directly to the gate. The layers of white marble steps add to its magnificence. The Parliament Building was destroyed twice, once during World War II, when the German fascists destroyed part of it. The second time was by the counter-revolutionaries during the October events. There is a large red star on the roof of the cylindrical hall of the Parliament Building. This was installed after liberation. In the past, it illuminated every night in Budapest and caressed every sleeping person in Budapest. However, the counter-revolutionaries damaged this red star. Now there is scaffolding around it, and workers are re-erecting this glorious red star.
    The people's Budapest is the most beautiful. The Liberty Statue on Gellért Hill symbolizes the freedom and liberation of the people. In the very center under the twelve-meter-high Liberty Statue is the Soviet national emblem and a Soviet soldier holding a red flag. On the left and right sides are Hungarian heroes who fiercely attacked the fascist bandits. This tallest and most majestic monument in Budapest is the embodiment of the beauty of Budapest. To its left is Pest, and to its right is Buda. The gentle Danube, like a ribbon slipping at your feet, the clear sky of Budapest, with white clouds rising, flying past the Liberty Statue. The counter-revolutionaries shouted "freedom" but destroyed the Liberty Statue, the most cherished symbol of freedom in the hearts of the people. This is the best evidence to explain the counter-revolutionary essence of the October events to everyone who comes to Budapest.
    On the second day of my arrival in Budapest, I visited this hill. On an evening in August, I went again. The hammer and sickle sculpture under the Liberty Statue has been restored. People put flowers in front of the monument. No matter how the counter-revolutionaries slander, the friendship forged by the blood of the Hungarian and Soviet people cannot be destroyed.
    At night, looking at Budapest from Gellért Hill is like looking at Moscow from Lenin Hills. Looking up, the sky is full of stars; looking down, it is another starry sky. This is the light of Budapest. At this time, the Danube is filled with blue and gray water. The starlight, moonlight, and the lights of Budapest are intertwined in the Danube to form an incomparably bright light, like a golden dragon, gently swimming.
    When I left Gellért Hill and the car was traveling along the Danube River, I saw the soaring Liberty Statue once again. She held olive leaves in her hand, as if she was about to fly in this vast and free sky.
    Budapest, how beautiful you are! You are more beautiful than before. You are not an ordinary city, but Budapest, which has stood firm after a cruel test. (Attached picture)

    布达佩斯，我看见你了！
    ——匈牙利访问记之一
    汪琦
    布达佩斯！全世界的人从去年十月那一紧急的时刻起，都在关心着你。因为资产阶级和反革命，企图在匈牙利复辟，制造了吓人听闻的恐怖事件。十天以后（去年10月23日到11月4日），匈牙利的社会主义工人党和工农革命政府，率领着还带着创伤的劳动人民，向反革命反击，革命最后胜利了。这一切都是从匈牙利的首都——布达佩斯开始的。
    经过一反一复的革命政权的生死斗争，匈牙利的心脏，拥有二百万人口的布达佩斯，现在怎么样了呢？多瑙河上的皇后，是不是还像昔日一样的美丽？这里，我想引用我刚到布达佩斯的日记片断，把我最初的印象介绍给读者。
    6月30日：上午九点多钟，到了布达佩斯，住在多瑙河中最大的一个岛上。这是玛尔格蒂岛。下午，米白尔（匈籍翻译）领我到岛上各处走走。与其说这是一个岛，不如说是一座大花园，处处花木并茂，游人来来往往。今天是星期天，岛上人特别多。二十六路公共汽车从佩斯开到岛上来，总是满载。许多人在一清早全家带了吃的东西，到岛上巴拉汀努斯游泳池。花四个福林买一张票，可以玩一整天。
    岛上的运动场，也吸引了不少人。匈牙利人酷爱足球，在几次国际比赛中都得到了优等奖。我在岛上旅馆里拧开收音机，只听得人声鼎沸，夹杂着掌声、笑声和喝彩声。米白尔告诉我：今天在新修的能容数万人的大运动场里，正举行着一场热烈紧张的国际球赛。
  我们也到了布达佩斯最热闹的一条街——列宁大街。去年十月反革命事件中，这条街被破坏得最厉害。现在大都恢复起来了，只有少数房屋周围还搭着脚手架子，那些刚修理好的房子，门面都是用素雅颜色油漆起来的，远远地望去，非常美观。店铺今天照例都休息。商店的门关着，但那玻璃橱窗里五光十色的商品，却很吸引人。米白尔说，匈牙利出产的女式细洋毛线衣、新式高跟皮鞋、玻璃丝袜很好看，布达佩斯的妇女很爱这些高级用品，商店一有这些东西，很快就卖光了。果然，在有这些商品的玻璃橱窗前，站的人最多，要不是街上有些房屋还显露出弹痕，怎会想到这里曾发生过最激烈的战斗？！
    当我们回岛上的时候，经过通到布达和佩斯的玛尔格蒂桥，我们站在桥上，眺望远处。布达山上的巍峨的城堡式的古代建筑，一个接着一个；山坡上绿色树丛中一幢幢的小洋房，若隐若现，非常好看。面临多瑙河的国会大厦，像一顶皇冠一样的庄严，它那林立的尖顶，把佩斯那一排一排看不到边的高楼，都衬托得矮小了。秀丽的多瑙河，托着飞箭似的小船，静静地流过桥下。我多么想大声地说：布达佩斯，我看见你了！
    要了解今天的布达佩斯，必须知道十月反革命事件中的布达佩斯。再请看我到达布达佩斯第二天的一段日记吧。
    7月1日：我们今天参观了十月反革命事件的展览会。这个展览会的绝大部分材料，都是西方记者和报纸提供的一些照片和新闻报道。其中有很大一部分照片，是这样留下来的：十月事件中来到匈牙利的西方记者和一些不明身份的人，本来想把这些照片作为他们的“辉煌的战果”，呈到他们主子的面前。可是，革命的反击太神迅了，他们无法带走这些照片，落在人民的手里了。
    这真是一个大恐怖、大反动、大野蛮的记载，展览会中有一幅这样的照片：一群反革命分子把一个公安军战士打死了，又用绳子把他的脚捆住，一个反革命分子倒拖着尸体，其他的反革命分子站在旁边，正在为他们那毫无人道的行为而狂乐。
    在布达佩斯一家最大的书店前面，满街都是从这家书店里抛掷出来的书，街上简直成了书的河流。反革命分子正在焚毁这些书籍。这也是十月反革命事件展览会展出的一张照片。反革命分子打着匈牙利最伟大的诗人裴多菲的招牌，可是，他们把裴多菲的诗集也烧了。
    我也亲眼看见了反革命分子暴行的证物。有一天，陪我们参观的同志，把我们引到共和国广场一所房子前面。这座楼房全被毁了，墙上每一寸地方都有枪眼，这就是英雄的过去市党委的办公大楼。房子前面有一排树，有的树身变成了白色，陪我们的同志说，因为反革命分子冲进了市党委，抓出许多保卫市党委的共产党员和公安军战士，把他们倒吊在树上，活活用火烧死，把树皮也全烧光了。现在这座楼房正在修复中，它将成为十月反革命事件的博物馆。
    在布达佩斯，随时随地都能找到十月反革命事件的痕迹。国会大厦是布达佩斯全城最引人注目的一个建筑，于1885年兴建到1904年建成，在欧洲很有名。解放后，匈牙利中央人民政府就在这里，整个国会大厦建筑得华丽而精细，中间圆柱大厅，完全用大理石砌成，大厅的顶尖是全城最高的建筑，经过大厅，一直通到大门，那一层一层的白色大理石的阶梯，更增加了它的富丽堂皇的气势。国会大厦两次被毁，一次是第二次世界大战的时候，德国法西斯毁坏了一部分。第二次是十月事件中的反革命分子。国会大厦圆柱大厅的屋顶上，有一颗很大的红星，这是解放以后安上去的，它在以往的日子里，照着布达佩斯的每一个夜晚，抚爱着每一个安眠的布达佩斯人。可是，反革命分子把这颗红星打坏了。现在它的周围搭了架子，工人们正在把这颗光荣的红星，重新竖立起来。
    人民的布达佩斯，才是最美丽的，盖雷山上的自由神纪念碑，象征着人民的自由和解放。在高达十二公尺的自由神像下的正中间，是苏联国徽和手执红旗的苏联士兵，左右两边各有一个痛击法西斯强盗的匈牙利英雄。这个布达佩斯最高的、最雄伟的纪念碑，就是布达佩斯美的化身。它的左边是佩斯，右边是布达。轻柔的多瑙河，像滑落在脚边的飘带，布达佩斯的晴朗的天空，升起了朵朵的白云，从自由神的身边飞过。反革命分子口口声声喊着“自由”，却把人民心目中最珍贵的自由神纪念碑毁坏了。这是最好不过的证据，向每一个到布达佩斯来的人，说明十月事件的反革命的实质。
    我到布达佩斯的第二天，曾到过这个山上，8月一天的晚上，我又去了。自由神像下的镰刀斧头雕塑已恢复起来了。人们在纪念碑前放了鲜花。不管反革命分子怎样的污蔑，匈苏人民鲜血结成的友谊，是破坏不了的。
    晚上，从盖雷山上看布达佩斯，就像从列宁山上看莫斯科一样。抬头，满天星光灿烂；低头，又是一个星空。这是布达佩斯的灯光，此时的多瑙河，充溢着蓝色夹杂着灰色的河水。星光、月光和布达佩斯的灯光，在多瑙河里交织成无比鲜艳的光华，像一条金色的龙，在轻轻地游荡着。
    我离开盖雷山，汽车驰行在多瑙河边的时候，我又一次看见了那凌空而起的自由神像。她手擎橄榄树叶，好像马上就要在这广阔自由的天空下飞翔起来。
    布达佩斯，你多美啊！你比过去更美了。你不是一个普通的城市，是经过残酷考验而依然挺立的布达佩斯。（附图片）
