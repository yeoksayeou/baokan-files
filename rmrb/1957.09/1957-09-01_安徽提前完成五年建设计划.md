    Anhui Completes Five-Year Construction Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Number of construction projects: 804
    Total floor space: 2.1 million square meters
    New housing: Accommodates 200,000 people

    Our Correspondent in Hefei, August 31st: Anhui Province has already overfulfilled its basic construction tasks for the First Five-Year Plan, and it is expected to exceed the original plan by 49.1% by the end of the year.

    The average annual investment amount in Anhui Province's First Five-Year Plan has increased more than threefold compared to the actual performance in 1952. There are a total of 804 designated construction projects, most of which are newly built projects. The construction area in the five years is approximately 2.1 million square meters.

    Because of the overfulfillment of this plan, the originally backward economic situation in Anhui has undergone great changes. In recent years, fertilizer industry and agricultural implement manufacturing have been established, and the power, metallurgy, coal, chemical industry, and light industry have been further developed. Many products that could not be produced in the past can now be produced. Daily necessities such as enamelware, glassware, and gold pens used to be entirely imported from other provinces, but now they are produced in batches within the province. Anhui-made grinding wheels and cork products are selling well throughout the country, and cork bricks are also exported to foreign countries in large quantities; many machines can also support other provinces. In the past few years, mineral resources have also been investigated, proving that Anhui Province is extremely rich in underground resources. This provides favorable conditions for the further development of Anhui's industry.

    The basic construction work of agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, post and telecommunications, culture, education, and health, as well as urban construction in the province, has also achieved remarkable results. Thirteen tractor stations have been established throughout the province, increasing the number of tractors by 853 standard units. Six new reservoirs have been built throughout the province, and a large number of small and medium-sized water conservancy projects have been completed, which has significantly reduced waterlogging and drought disasters. In terms of post and telecommunications, telephone access has been achieved in every township. In addition, universities and middle schools have added more than 105,000 student seats; the newly built houses have solved the accommodation problem for approximately 200,000 people.

    安徽提前完成五年建设计划
    建设项目  804个
    建筑面积  210万平方公尺
    新建住宅  可住20万人
    本报合肥31日电  安徽省已经超额完成第一个五年计划的基本建设任务，预计到年底可以超过原计划49.1％。
    安徽省第一个五年计划平均每年的投资数量比1952年的实绩增加三倍以上。规定的建设项目共有八百零四个，大部分是新建工程。五年内建筑面积约为二百一十多万平方公尺。
    因为超额完成了这个计划，安徽原来落后的经济面貌发生了很大的变化。几年来，建立了肥料工业和农具制造业，进一步发展了电力、冶金、煤炭、化学工业和轻工业。许多过去不能生产的产品，现在能够生产了。搪瓷、玻璃器皿、金笔等人民生活必需品过去全靠外省输入，现在省内已经成批生产。安徽制造的砂轮、软木产品已经畅销全国，其中软木砖还向国外大量出口；很多机械也能支援外省。这几年，对矿藏资源也进行了调查，证明安徽省地下资源极为丰富。这就为安徽省工业的进一步发展提供了有利条件。
    全省农业、水利、交通、邮电、文教卫生事业的基本建设工作和城市建设工作也有显著成绩。全省已经建立起十三个拖拉机站，增加拖拉机八百五十三标准台。全省新建六个水库，完成了大批中小型水利工程，使水旱灾害显著减轻。在邮电事业方面，已经实现了乡乡通电话。另外，大中学校新增加学生座位十万五千多个；新建的住宅，解决了大约二十万人的住宿问题。
