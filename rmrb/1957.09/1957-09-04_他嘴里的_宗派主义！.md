The "Sectarianism!" in His Mouth
	Zou Difan

	He is an editor of a magazine,
	Endless "resentment" in his heart.
	Dozens of times he burst out with one sentence:
	"You have sectarianism!"

	This is a submitted manuscript,
	Cursing the Party's leadership of literature and art.
	Something about "when it's sometimes warm, sometimes cold,
	It is most difficult to rest..."
	Something about "confusion, ignorance," "the past was better than the present,"
	He also felt it wasn't enough to express his "innermost thoughts."
	The editorial board said: "This is an attack on the Party."
	He said: "This is an old writer,
	You have sectarianism!"

	This is a submitted manuscript,
	Instigated by the Rightists.
	Saying something about professors running the school,
	Saying something about abolishing the school Party committee system.
	He even added a big headline:
	"A great ideological revolution, a new cultural May Fourth."
	The editorial board said: "This is bourgeois democracy."
	He said: "Respect young writers, new forces,
	You have sectarianism!"

	He even loudly called out:
	"You are responsible Party comrades,
	Why don't you stand up and expose the Party's secrets?
	After the journal becomes bureaucratized,
	Why can't it be like a machine gun firing at the institution?
	Knock on the door of the Writers Association,
	Uncover the lid of the Party group!"
	Here he met a wall,
	"Oh, you have sectarianism!"

	So he went around,
	Looking for his old acquaintances.
	Wanting to start a coterie publication, advocating "great democracy,"
	Wanting to freely attack the Party,
	Like crows filling the sky, black characters filling the paper,
	According to the bourgeoisie's consciousness,
	Also wanting the state publishing house to unconditionally provide convenience,
	As if letting a tiger walk on the road,
	Freely looking for food.

	All the comrades pointed at his face in anger:
	"Schemer, what are you up to?"
	At this time he lowered his head and muttered to himself:
	"Are you still like the literary and art circles?
	You are encircling and suppressing me,
	You have sectarianism!"

### 他嘴里的“宗派主义！”

    他嘴里的“宗派主义！”
    邹荻帆
    他是个杂志的编辑，
    无穷的“忿懑”在他心底。
    几十次迸出一句话：
   “你们有宗派主义！”
    这是一篇来稿，
    咒骂党领导文艺。
    什么“乍暖还寒，
    最难将息……”，
    什么“昏迷、无知”、“今不如昔”，
    他还嫌没有说出“心中事”。
    编委们说：“这是向党攻击。”
    他说：“这是老作家呀，
    你们有宗派主义！”
    这是一篇来稿，
    受了右派的嗾使。
    说什么教授治校，
    说什么取消学校党委制。
    他还加一个头号大标题：
    “思想大革命，文化新五四。”
    编委们说：“这是资产阶级民主。”
    他说：“尊重青年作家、新生力量呀，
    你们有宗派主义！”
    他还大声呼吁着：
    “你们是党员负责同志，
    为什么不起来揭露党内秘密？
    刊物机关化之后，
    为什么就不能像机关枪向机关射击？
    敲作协的大门呀，
    揭党组的盖子！”
    在这里他算碰了壁，
    “哦，你们有宗派主义！”
    于是他四出活动，
    找他的老相识。
    要办同人刊、鼓吹“大民主”，
    要自由自在攻击党，
    像乌鸦飞满天，黑字印满纸，
    按照资产阶级的意识，
    还要国家出版社无条件给与便利，
    仿佛让老虎到马路上去散步，
    自由自在地寻找粮食。
    全体同志都愤怒地指着他的脸：
    “野心家，你打什么主意？”
    这时他低头喁喁独语：
    “你们还像文艺界？
    你们是在围剿我，
    你们有宗派主义！”
