	“Name Unknown”
		Lín Hái
	Zhong Dianfei wrote a secret letter to He Chi, signing it "Name Unknown," and adding the annotation: "This was learned from the signature of a secret agent when watching 'National Day at Ten O'Clock' a few days ago. I didn't expect to actually use it now."

	To learn and use, it seems that Zhong Dianfei has a "secret agent" talent, but he says "actually" using it, I think not necessarily. To say it is inevitable to use it, it is more accurate.

	All right-wingers and anti-Party elements always use various pretexts, use conference speeches, write articles, make reports, etc., to openly attack the Party, and at the same time engage in "underground" activities of "name unknown". When their public activities fail, "underground" activities are their main or only way. And they are always prepared for this.

	When Zhang Bojun openly clamored for a "Political Design Institute," he was secretly holding "Six Professors Meetings"; Luo Longji openly said he wanted to establish a "Rehabilitation Committee," and secretly corresponded with his cronies to jointly plot "grand plans"; When Zhang Yousong proudly "raised my head, puffed out my chest, and joined the battle" in meetings and publications, he also wrote more than forty secret letters to his subordinates, directing the "battle." As for this Zhong Dianfei, wasn't he also beating the "drums of cinema" loudly, while engaging in "underground" conspiracy activities with his partners? "Name Unknown" is just a common method of writing secret letters. If secret agents can use it, why can't right-wingers use it? To carry out anti-Party and counter-revolutionary activities in the new society, this method will always be adopted. They not only are "name unknown," but sometimes even their "gender" changes. Didn't the anti-Party element Chen Ming pretend to be a girl's voice and call "Uncle Qixia"?

	Mr. Lao She said in "Reply to an Anonymous Letter": "Anonymous sir, thank you for your letter (whether it is from a person or a ghost)..." I think these people who play the "name unknown" trick, they live under the sunshine of socialism but feel no warmth at all, and insist on hiding underground. What else is in their hearts if not "ghosts"?

### “知名不具”

    “知名不具”
  　林孩
    锺惦棐向何迟写了一封密信，署名是“知名不具”，并加注解说：“这是前几天看‘国庆十点钟’时，从一个特务的署名学来的，不想现在居然用上了”。
    一学便会，一会便用，看来锺惦棐似乎满有“特务”天才，不过他说“居然”用上，我看未必。说是必然要用，倒更确切些。
    一切右派分子和反党分子总是打着各种幌子，利用会议发言，写文章，作报告等，公开向党攻击，一面也搞“知名不具”的“地下”活动。当他们公开的活动失败时，“地下”活动就是他们主要或唯一的方式了。而且他们是时刻都准备着这一手的。
    章伯钧在公开叫嚣搞什么“政治设计院”的时候，暗地里又在开“六教授会议”；罗隆基公开说要搞“平反委员会”，暗地里也和他的喽啰们密信往还，共图“大计”；张友松在会议上，在刊物上得意地“我昂起头，挺起胸来，投入战斗”的时候，也向他的部下写了四十多封密信，指挥“战斗”。至于这个锺惦棐，不也是一面把“电影的锣鼓”打得鼕鼕响，一面和他的伙伴们搞“地下”阴谋活动么？“知名不具”只是写密信的一种普通方法，特务会用，右派分子又何尝不会用。要在新社会进行反党、反革命的活动，这方法总是会被采用的。他们不仅“知名不具”，而且有时连“性别”也会变哩，反党分子陈明不是装做女孩子的声音叫过“企霞叔叔”么？
    老舍先生在“答匿名信”中说：“匿名先生，谢谢你（不管是人还是鬼）的信……”我看这些耍“知名不具”手法的人，他们生活在社会主义的阳光之下却感不到丝毫温暖，偏偏要躲到地下去，他们的心里不是有“鬼”是什么？
