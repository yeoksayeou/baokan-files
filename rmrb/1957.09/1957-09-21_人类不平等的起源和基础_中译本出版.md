Publication of Chinese Translation of "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men"

    "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an 18th-century French Enlightenment thinker, has been translated into Chinese and published by Sanlian Bookstore.

    Rousseau was a democrat of the 18th-century French Enlightenment movement, and his ideas reflected the interests of the petty bourgeoisie. His ideas were very influential, and his important works "The Social Contract" ("Min Yue Lun," "She Yue Lun"), "Emile," and "Confessions" have long been available in Chinese translations in our country.

    "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men" is Rousseau's early work (1754). It not only brilliantly expounds on the issue of social inequality and methods to overcome it but also wonderfully demonstrates Rousseau's dialectical way of thinking. In "Anti-Dühring," Engels highly valued this work, believing that "in Rousseau's book, one can already see not only the same line of reasoning as Marx in 'Das Kapital' but also a series of dialectical arguments that Rousseau elaborated on and Marx used in the same way: processes that are essentially antagonistic and contain contradictions, the transformation of each extreme towards its opposite, and finally, at the heart of everything, the negation of the negation."

    In this work, Rousseau sharply criticized the hierarchical system of feudal society, declaring that the cause of inequality was the emergence and development of private ownership. He believed that there are two types of inequality among humans: one is natural or physical inequality, which is set by nature and is constituted by differences in age, health, physical strength, and mental or spiritual qualities; the other is political or moral inequality, which is subordinate to a kind of contract and is set by people's consent, or at least authorized by people's consent. This book discusses the origin of the latter type of inequality.

    Rousseau believed that in the state of nature, that is, in primitive times, all people were once equal, free, without social oppression, poverty, and injustice, and were morally innocent. The phenomenon of human inequality arose and formed in the process of human social development. It has gone through three stages in human history: first, the emergence of private land ownership; second, with the emergence of the state, political inequality was formed on the basis of property inequality; and third, the formation of despotism. Rousseau believed that the emergence of inequality is related to social civilization, thus mistakenly believing that science, art, and culture not only cannot bring benefits to mankind but will also make people degenerate.

    Although Rousseau opposed the phenomenon of wide gap between the rich and the poor in society, he only opposed excessive personal property, not private property in general. On the contrary, he believed that a small amount of property for each person is both a necessary foundation for society and a foundation for human equality. In order to solve the problem of human inequality, he put forward the "Social Contract Theory" and attempted to establish a democratic regime that conformed to this theory, namely, a small patriarchal republic. Rousseau here is only trying to defend the future bourgeois revolution, and this idea of demanding democracy, freedom, and equality has the limitations of the bourgeoisie.

### “人类不平等的起源和基础”中译本出版

    “人类不平等的起源和基础”中译本出版
    十八世纪法国启蒙思想家卢梭的“人类不平等的起源和基础”，已译成中文，由三联书店出版。
    卢梭是十八世纪法国启蒙运动中的民主派，他的思想反映了小资产阶级的利益。他的思想影响很大，在我国也早就有他的重要著作“社会契约论”（“民约论”“社约论”）“爱弥儿”“忏悔录”等的中译本。
    “人类不平等的起源和基础”，是卢梭的早期著作（1754年）。它不仅杰出地阐述了关于社会的不平等及克服不平等的方法问题，而且精采地显示了卢梭的辩证的思想方法。恩格斯在“反杜林论”中，对这一著作予以很高的估价，认为“在卢梭的书上不但已经可以看到那种和马克思在‘资本论’中的论述同出一辙的议论，而且还可以看到卢梭所详细叙述的一系列和马克思运用得相同的辩证说法：本质上对抗的、包含着矛盾的过程，每个极端朝向它的对立面的转化，最后，作为一切的核心的，否定的否定。”
    在这一著作里，卢梭尖锐地批判了封建社会的等级制度，宣称产生不平等的原因就是私有制的出现和发展。他认为人类有两种不平等现象：一种是自然的或物理的不平等，它是自然所设定的，并且由年龄、健康、体力以及精神或心灵的性质的不同所构成的；另一种是政治或道德的不平等，它从属于一种契约，并且是由人们的同意而设定的，或者至少是由人们的同意而授权的。本书讨论的就是后一种不平等的起源问题。
    卢梭认为在自然状态下，即原始时代，一切人曾经都是平等的、自由的、没有社会压迫、贫困和不公平，而且在道德上都是天真无罪的。人类不平等的现象是在人类社会发展的过程中产生和形成的。它在人类历史上经历了三个阶段：一、土地私有制的出现；二、随着国家的出现，在财产不平等的基础上，形成了政治上的不平等；三、专制主义的形成。卢梭认为不平等现象的产生和社会文明有关，由此错误地认为科学、艺术、文化不但不能给人类带来好处，并会使人堕落。
    卢梭虽然反对社会上贫富悬殊的现象，但他只是反对个人财产过多，并不是一般地反对私有财产。他反而认为每人有小量的财产既是社会必要的基础，也是人类平等的基础。为了解决人类的不平等，他提出“社会契约论”，并企图建立符合这种理论的民主政权，即小型宗法共和国。卢梭在这里只是企图为未来的资产阶级革命作辩护，这种要求民主、自由和平等的思想带有资产阶级的局限性。
