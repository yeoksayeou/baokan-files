Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 21st: A number of ancient cities in Shaanxi Province have been transformed into new industrial cities. The majority of the more than two hundred factories and mines built in Shaanxi since liberation are located in these cities.

    The ancient capital of Xi'an is now a comprehensive industrial city including machinery, electrical engineering, and textiles; Xianyang, which prospered during the Qin and Han dynasties but gradually declined, is now a cotton textile industrial city; Tongchuan, located in the hilly canyons on the north bank of the Wei River, is now Shaanxi's coal industry area; Baoji, situated at the intersection of railways from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces, is being formed into a new city of light machinery industry; Xingping, which has had virtually no industry since its establishment in the Western Han Dynasty, is also developing into a machinery industrial city.

    Since 1953, massive construction projects have been carried out in these cities. A total of more than 8 million square meters of various buildings have been completed, and a total of more than 500 kilometers of urban roads have been newly built, changing the face of these old cities. On the periphery of the old square-shaped city of Xi'an, a wide circle of buildings has been expanded, and the total urban area has expanded by 4.4 times compared to the old city. The Big Goose Pagoda, a Tang Dynasty building that was once isolated in the suburbs, has now become a building on the edge of the city.

    Industrial construction has brought prosperity to these cities. A number of cinemas, theaters, and shops have been added to the originally deserted streets; various supply outlets, public canteens, bookstores, post and telecommunications offices, and bank savings offices have also appeared in the new industrial areas. In Xi'an, more than 70 kilometers of bus routes have made urban transportation more active. Xi'an, Baoji, and other places that historically lacked tap water equipment have now built seven water plants and three water stations. Industrial construction and municipal construction projects are still being carried out continuously in these cities.

    古城变新城
    据新华社西安21日电　陕西省一批古老的城市已经变成新的工业城市。解放以后陕西兴建的两百多个厂矿，大多数分布在这些城市里。
    古都西安已经是一个包括机械、电工、纺织等综合性的工业城市；兴盛于秦汉而逐代衰退的咸阳，现在是一座棉纺织工业城市；位于渭水北岸丘陵峡谷中的铜川，现在是陕西的煤炭工业区；地处陕、甘、川三省铁路冲道的宝鸡，正在形成为一座轻型机械工业的新城；从西汉建城以来一直没有什么工业的兴平，目前也在向机械工业城市发展。
    1953年以来，在这些城市中进行了巨大的建设工程。已经竣工的共有八百多万平方公尺的各种建筑物，以及新筑成的共有五百多公里的城市道路，改变了这些旧城的面貌。在旧西安方块状故城的外围，已经扩建了宽宽的一圈建筑物，城市总面积比旧城扩展了四点四倍。过去孤立在郊区的唐代建筑大雁塔，现在已经成为市区的边缘建筑物。
    工业建设为这些城市带来了繁荣景象。原来冷落的街头，新添了一批电影院、剧场和商店；各种供应门市部、公共食堂、书店、邮电所和银行储蓄所，也在新工业区相继出现。在西安，七十多公里长的公共汽车路线使城市交通更加活跃。历史上没有自来水设备的西安、宝鸡等地，现在已经建成七个自来水厂和三个自来水站。工业建设和市政建设工程，还在这些城市里不断地进行着。
