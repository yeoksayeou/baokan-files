Xinhua News Agency, September 11th, Washington dispatch: When U.S. Secretary of State Dulles discussed the Middle East situation at a press conference on September 10th, he reiterated that the United States could not accept the Soviet Union's proposal for major powers to reach an agreement not to interfere in Middle East affairs. He said, "The United States is skeptical about reaching such a 'non-interference' arrangement with the Soviet Union."

In his answers to reporters' questions, Dulles repeated the same old tune, saying that the Soviet Union's so-called "aggressive ambitions" in the Middle East had "revived" and the independence of Middle Eastern countries was being "threatened."

When asked whether the United States would use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to directly militarily intervene in Syria, Dulles said on the one hand that the domestic situation in Syria was still "not very clear," and he did not think that Syria might have a situation that would allow the United States to directly militarily intervene based on the Eisenhower Doctrine. On the other hand, Dulles tried to lay the groundwork for the United States to instigate an armed attack on Syria. He said that one of the conditions for the United States to carry out direct military intervention was to see whether a country was "controlled by international communism." And "in the next week or two, the situation may develop in a way that makes it clear beyond doubt that Syria is being ruled."

Dulles also tried his best to conceal the sinister purpose of the United States accelerating the shipment of arms to the Middle East, saying that the United States' shipment of arms to Jordan was not a "new action," but merely an "accelerated" implementation of the original plan.

　　美国硬要干涉中东事务
　　杜勒斯仍说不能同苏联达成协议
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯9月10日在记者招待会上谈到中东局势的时候，重申美国不能接受苏联关于大国达成不干涉中东事务的协议的建议。他说，“美国对于同苏联达成这种‘不干涉’的安排表示怀疑”。
    杜勒斯在他的答记者问里重弹滥调，说什么苏联对中东的所谓“侵略野心”已经“复活”，中东国家的独立受到“威胁”。
    在问到美国是否要运用“艾森豪威尔主义”对叙利亚进行直接军事干涉时，杜勒斯一方面说叙利亚的国内局势还“不十分明朗”，他不认为叙利亚可能会发生使美国可以根据艾森豪威尔主义进行直接军事干涉的情况。另一方面，杜勒斯又力图为美国策动对叙利亚的武装进攻埋下伏线。他说，美国进行直接军事干涉的条件之一是看一个国家是否“被国际共产主义所控制”。而“在今后一二星期内，局势可能会有发展，使人毫无疑问地看清楚，叙利亚是被统治了”。
    杜勒斯还竭力掩饰美国加速向中东运送军火的罪恶目的，他说，美国运送军火给约旦不是“新的行动”，不过是原有计划的“加速”执行罢了。
