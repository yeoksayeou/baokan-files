Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 7th. Teachers and students of Xinjiang August First Agricultural College have been holding large and small meetings in recent days to expose and criticize the anti-communist rightist element Guan Wuyu.

Guan Wuyu is an associate professor. During the "Great Blooming and Contending," he was the vanguard of the elements in the college who attacked the Communist Party. He instigated trouble among the students with extreme viciousness, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party in the August First Agricultural College.

Guan Wuyu fabricated a set of extremely reactionary so-called "social development theory" to confront the socialist revolutionary theory. He said that human history initially consisted of a society ruled by herdsmen, followed by a society ruled by farmers, a society ruled by merchants, and now a society ruled by workers, and in the future, it will be a society ruled by intellectuals. He said that a society ruled by workers is the most barbaric, and only a society ruled by intellectuals in the future will be the most civilized. He opposed class struggle, saying "class is not human nature, and struggle is not human nature," "Biology concludes that there is no struggle between the same species, and all humans are the same species, so there can be no struggle." Guan Wuyu opposed the liberation of the working people, saying "Old cows should be liberated first, because old cows are the most hardworking." He said that in his "civilized society," he would "let the old cows go to the mountains to play." He claimed that the so-called united front was not the Communist Party's united front towards him, but his united front towards the Communist Party, and he maintained this united front in order to realize his ideal "civilized society." He opposed the mass line, saying to the students: "Copernicus did not follow the mass line, and invented the heliocentric theory; Empress Dowager Cixi followed the mass line the most, and employed the Boxers, which led to the destruction of the country."

During the blooming and contending period, Guan Wuyu sang the tune of "laymen cannot lead experts," and "those without knowledge cannot lead those with knowledge," saying that "those without knowledge running factories and schools hinders the development of productive forces," and that "intellectuals are the most truthful and scientific," and "intellectuals are the locomotives and should be placed at the front of the train." He arrogantly and blatantly demanded the abolition of the Party committee system, demanded the implementation of professor-led governance of the school, and demanded the organization of a "coalition government" in the August First Agricultural College, denouncing the Communist Party's leadership of the August First Agricultural College as a "feudal form." He colluded with other rightist elements in the August First Agricultural College, actively encouraging them to attack the Communist Party; he graded them based on the degree of their malicious attacks, giving only two or three points to several rightist elements, believing that only his and another rightist element's blooming and contending had barely passed. Guan Wuyu had always opposed students participating in any movements, but this time he revealed his true colors, inciting students to "take action." He rebuked the students of the Water Conservancy Department, saying, "We have already spoken for you, you should stand up and fight." He also instigated students to make trouble at the State Council, offering suggestions to students to "concentrate efforts and not work alone." He also spread rumors that the college leaders were going to be replaced, and that someone would become the dean of academic affairs, etc.

Guan Wuyu has always hated the Communist Party and the revolution. He harbored deep hatred for Communist Party members. When the responsible Party cadres in the college went to visit him, he said they were going to monitor him. When the college promoted him and raised his salary, he said that the Communist Party wanted to "buy him off." He scolded the faculty, staff and students who approached the Communist Party as "lacking character and wanting to be promoted and get rich," and scolded Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members as "acting as secret agents." One of his sons, who is a Communist Party member and works as a reporter, was also scolded for "informing everywhere."

He opposed all the revolutionary movements led by the Communist Party. He falsely accused the Communist Party of "taking the credit for the heavens as their own" for resisting Japan, and that the land reform was "rascals in power." During the "Three-Anti" campaign, the government gave him lenient treatment for his corruption and did not sentence him, but he held a grudge and repeatedly retaliated, attempting to overturn the verdict. Whenever the topic of intellectual transformation was raised, he would become furious. He also arrogantly wanted to bring the cadres who led the anti-rebellion movement in the August First Agricultural College to be beaten with boards.

He often spread reactionary remarks among the students, scolding the People's Liberation Army as "barbaric," and has always discriminated against students transferred from the military, saying that these people only knew how to use machine guns.

At the reasoning and struggle meetings, Guan Wuyu repeatedly concealed and defended his reactionary words and deeds, saying that his reactionary remarks were his humble opinions to help the Communist Party rectify its work style; he also said that he was old and a little confused, and that he did not have any political views. However, his layers of defense were defeated one after another in the reasoning and struggle of the masses. Everyone sternly exposed his consistent anti-communist ugly face. Not only did he have a set of fallacies, but he also took action. In the face of the facts, Guan Wuyu had to bow his head and admit his guilt, expressing his willingness to confess his problems. Now, the teachers and students of the August First Agricultural College are conducting in-depth exposure and criticism of Guan Wuyu's reactionary words and deeds.

    新疆八一农学院揭露出一个穷凶极恶的右派分子
    关五玉狂妄透顶反共成性
    据新华社乌鲁木齐7日电　新疆八一农学院师生连日举行大会小会，揭露和批判反共成性的右派分子关五玉。
    关五玉是副教授。在“大鸣大放”期间，他是这个学院里 分子向共产党进攻的急先锋。他穷凶极恶地在学生中煽风点火，企图推翻共产党在八一农学院的领导。
    关五玉制造了一套极端反动的所谓“社会发展论”，来和社会主义革命理论对抗。他说人类历史最初是牧民当权的社会，之后是农民当权的社会、商人当权的社会，现在是工人当权的社会，将来是知识分子当权的社会。他说，工人当权的社会最野蛮，只有将来知识分子当权的社会才是最文明的。他反对阶级斗争，说“阶级不是人的天性，斗争更不是人的天性”，“生物学得出结论，同种间无斗争，凡人都是同种，不能有斗争存在”。关五玉反对劳动人民的解放，说“应该先解放老牛，老牛最辛苦”。他说，到了他的那个“文明社会”，要“把老牛都放到山上去游玩”。他声称所谓统一战线不是共产党对他的统一战线，而是他对共产党的统一战线，他是为了实现他理想的那个“文明社会”而保持这一统一战线的。他反对群众路线，对学生说：“哥白尼是不走群众路线的，发明了地动说；慈禧太后是最走群众路线的，起用了义和团，弄得国破家亡。”
    在鸣放期间，关五玉高唱“外行不能领导内行”、“没有知识的不能领导有知识的”等谬论，说什么“没有知识的办工厂、学校就妨碍了生产力的发展”，说“知识分子是最讲真理、最科学的”，“知识分子是火车头，应该挂在列车的最前面”。他狂妄地明目张胆地要求取消党委制，要求实行教授治校，要求在八一农学院组织“联合政府”，把共产党对八一农学院的领导骂为“封建形式”。他勾结八一农学院的其他右派分子，积极鼓动他们向共产党进攻；根据他们进攻的恶毒程度给以评分，把若干右派分子都只评了两三分，认为只有他和另一个右派分子鸣放才刚刚及格。关五玉是一向反对学生参加任何运动的，这次他露出真面目，煽动学生“行动起来”。他责备水利系的学生说，“我们已经替你们讲了话，你们应该起来斗争。”他还嗾使学生到国务院去闹事，向学生献策“要集中力量搞，不要单干。”他还散布学院领导要被撤换，某某人要当教务长等等谣言。
    关五玉是一贯仇视共产党、仇视革命的，他对共产党员仇恨入骨。学院里的党员负责干部去看望他，他说是去监视他。学院给他提级提薪，他说是共产党想“收买他”。他把靠拢共产党的教职学员都骂作“无品行，想升官发财”，把共产党员、共青团员骂作“当特务的”。他的一个儿子是共产党员，在作记者工作，也被骂作是“到处告密”的。
    他对共产党所领导的历次革命运动一概反对。他诬蔑共产党抗日为“贪天之功以为己功”，土改是“二流子当权”。在“三反”期间，政府对他的贪污罪行加以宽大处理，没有判刑，他反而怀恨在心，屡屡反噬，企图翻案。只要提起知识分子改造，他就怒从心来。他还狂妄地要把八一农学院领导肃反运动的干部拉来打板子。
    他经常在学生中散布反动言论，骂人民解放军“野蛮”，并且一向歧视从部队转业就学的学生，说这些人只会开机关枪。
    在说理斗争会上，关五玉对他的反动言行一再地掩饰辩解，把他的反动言论说成是帮助共产党整风的鄙陋之见；又说他自己年岁大了，有些糊涂，说他并没有什么政治见解。但是他的层层防线，在大家的说理斗争中节节溃败了。大家严正地揭发了他一贯反共的丑恶面目。不但有一套谬论，而且有行动。在事实面前，关五玉不得不低头认罪，表示愿意交代问题。现在，八一农学院师生正在对关五玉的反动言行进行深入的揭发和批判。
