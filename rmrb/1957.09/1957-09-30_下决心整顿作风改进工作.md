To carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end, to deeply engage in the socialist debate in all circles of the country, and at the same time, to earnestly rectify our work style and improve the work of our Party and state organs: this is the main content of the current nationwide rectification campaign and the primary task before us.

Judging from the current situation, the anti-Rightist struggle in organs above the provincial and municipal levels, in all universities and colleges, and in all democratic parties has basically defeated the Rightists' attacks, refuted the Rightists' fallacies, and greatly raised the political consciousness of the masses. In organs below the provincial and municipal levels, in secondary and primary education circles, in the industrial and commercial sectors, and in other areas, the struggle is also continuing to expand and deepen. At the same time, a vigorous socialist education movement is being carried out among workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and other mass strata, and socialist ideology is penetrating the hearts of the people across the country with unprecedented force. In many places and many units, due to the high political enthusiasm of the masses, many vigorous new atmospheres have emerged in the work. We must continue to deepen the anti-Rightist struggle and continue to deepen the great socialist debate, so that many fundamental issues of right and wrong can be resolved more thoroughly among the masses, and we must not allow the matter to end hastily. On the other hand, while carrying out the struggle and debate, we must resolutely implement the spirit of rectifying while correcting, earnestly handle the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, and promptly resolve all problems that can be resolved. All units where the anti-Rightist struggle is nearing its end should actively prepare to promptly enter the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, earnestly listen to the criticisms and opinions of the masses, repeatedly solicit the criticisms and opinions of the masses, thoroughly examine the shortcomings and errors in the work, formulate specific measures to improve work and improve work style, and rely on the supervision of the masses to implement them.

The victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and the development of the socialist education movement have provided extremely favorable conditions for systematically rectifying the work style of our Party and improving the work of our Party and the state. Our rectification movement had to shift to a stage focusing on counterattacking the Rightists due to the rampant attacks of the Rightists. After the anti-Rightist struggle has achieved a major victory, and at the same time, a great socialist debate has been launched among the people, the Rightists can no longer continue to make trouble. Moreover, because the broad masses have distinguished right from wrong and raised their awareness, and they trust our Party more and are closer to our Party, we have greater confidence that we can effectively rectify our own work style and improve the work of the Party and the state. As long as our attitude is resolute, our actions are swift, and we promptly resolve the problems that should be resolved and can be resolved, the Party's prestige among the masses will be further enhanced, and its relationship with the masses will be closer.

Many units, while concentrating their main strength on counterattacking the Rightists, have allocated a certain amount of manpower to set up offices for rectifying while correcting, specializing in studying and handling the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, and have already, with the active support of the masses, solved a number of problems that can be solved immediately. For example, the Eighth Office of the State Council recently invited all the attendees of the joint meeting of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to hold a forum, and reported to them the preliminary results of handling the opinions put forward by the industrial and commercial sectors during the period of great blooming and contending. After earnestly studying the criticisms and opinions of the masses, the leading organs of Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces have formulated new regulations on living standards, etc., and eliminated some phenomena of special privileges in the lives of cadres. Many factories, mines, enterprises, and rural grassroots organizations across the country have recently used great efforts to handle many urgently needed solutions based on the reasonable criticisms and suggestions of the masses. According to statistics from 31 factories in Beijing alone, as of September 5, more than 3,000 problems formed from more than 100,000 opinions had been resolved. Some Party organizations in other places and units have collected the opinions put forward by the masses, summarized them into several major issues, and established special research groups to study and propose solutions separately. This has prepared the ground for systematic rectification. All these practices have been well received by the masses. The masses have once again realized that our Party is a party that serves the people wholeheartedly, and their confidence in the rectification movement has been further enhanced.

However, there are also many unit leaders who have focused their efforts on the anti-Rightist struggle and relaxed the task of rectifying while correcting. To this day, they have not yet studied and handled the opinions of the masses well, and have not yet carried out concrete preparatory work to solve those problems that must be solved. They do not understand that even when concentrating their efforts on counterattacking the Rightists, they should allocate the necessary time and manpower to specialize in studying and handling the opinions of the masses. All problems that can be solved should be solved immediately; all problems that cannot be solved temporarily should also be actively prepared for and explained clearly to the masses, so as to avoid suspicion and disappointment among the masses. Failure to do so is not only detrimental to improving work, but also detrimental to deepening the anti-Rightist struggle.

Of course, some of the issues raised by the masses, such as those related to business policies, organizational structures, and administrative systems, are not only complex but also involve a wide range of areas, requiring consultation with relevant agencies or careful consideration by senior leading agencies and longer-term research before a proper solution can be proposed. Hasty actions and rash decisions on issues that affect the overall situation will inevitably cause new confusion. However, in fact, most of the issues raised by the masses, such as many issues related to the work of organs, personnel work, etc., especially issues related to the ideological style of leading cadres and Party member cadres in this unit, can not only be solved in this unit, but also can be solved quickly. Therefore, it is wrong to delay the improvement of work by citing any difficulties and being weak.

Another important reason why the improvement of work in many units is slow and weak is that a small number of comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the harm of shortcomings and errors in their work, and do not have enough courage to freely mobilize the masses to criticize and openly accept the criticisms of the masses. Some comrades are afraid that after being criticized by the masses, their prestige will be lowered and it will be difficult to work in the future, or they are afraid that erroneous opinions among the masses will raise their heads, and it will be difficult for those who adhere to correct opinions to distinguish them. These ideas are obviously incorrect, and the successful experiences of those units that have already begun to rectify have also proved that the facts are by no means so. There are also a very small number of comrades who wrongly treat immature criticisms from the masses with the same methods as treating Rightists, focusing on "criticizing" some incorrect opinions among the masses, instead of enthusiastically supporting the criticisms of the masses and resolutely relying on the strength of the masses to rectify their work style and improve their work. This erroneous approach must be quickly corrected in particular. The incorrect opinions of the masses must be corrected through debate and education, but this is only one aspect of the matter, and it is fundamentally different from the anti-Rightist struggle, and must not be confused. Socialist education for the masses cannot replace the improvement of leadership work. For the leaders of all units, the most important issue at present is that they must set aside a certain period (which cannot be very short), concentrate their efforts on relying on the criticisms and supervision of the masses to severely rectify their work style and improve their work. For all shortcomings and errors in the work, we must stand with the masses and strive to expose and eliminate them. If these shortcomings and errors are to be borne by oneself, then one should even more selflessly take the lead in resolutely correcting them without hesitation.

In short, rectifying work style, improving work, and opposing the Rightists are two inseparable components of the rectification movement. We must not only severely strike at the Rightists, but also severely rectify our work style and improve our work. There is no room for sentimentalism and hasty closure in opposing the Rightists, and there is no room for sentimentalism and hasty closure in improving work. Only when both aspects of the struggle are carried out resolutely and thoroughly can the purpose of the rectification movement be achieved, the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction be greatly advanced, and the unity between the Party and the broad masses of the people be greatly strengthened, and the Rightists be completely isolated. Only in this way can we win a complete victory in the movement.

    下决心整顿作风改进工作
    把反右派斗争进行到底，在全国各界深入开展社会主义的大辩论，同时又认真地整顿我们的作风，改进我们的党和国家机关的工作：这是目前正在进行的全民整风的主要内容，是摆在我们面前的主要任务。
    从当前的情况来看，反右派的斗争在省市以上的机关、各高等学校和各民主党派，已经基本上打垮了右派的进攻，驳倒了右派的谬论，大大地提高了群众的政治觉悟。在省市以下机关、中等和初等教育界、工商界和其他范围内，斗争也正在继续扩大和深入。同时，在工人、农民、士兵、学生和其他各阶层群众中，正在开展着声势浩大的社会主义教育运动，社会主义的思想正在以空前未有的力量深入全国的人心。在许多地方和许多单位中，由于群众的政治热情的高涨，工作中已经出现了很多蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。我们必须继续深入开展反右派的斗争，继续深入开展社会主义的大辩论，使许多根本性的、大是大非的问题能在群众中间获得比较透彻的解决，决不容许草率收兵。在另一方面，在进行斗争和辩论的同时，还必须坚决贯彻边整边改的精神，认真地处理群众的批评和建议，及时地解决一切能够解决的问题。凡是反右派斗争已经接近于结束的单位，更应该积极准备及时地转入着重整改的阶段，认真地听取群众的批评和意见，反复地征求群众的批评和意见，彻底地检查工作中的缺点错误，订出改进工作和改进作风的具体措施，依靠群众的监督加以贯彻执行。
    反右派斗争的胜利，社会主义教育运动的开展，为有系统地整顿我们党的作风，改进我们党和国家的工作，提供了极为有利的条件。我们的整风运动曾经由于右派的猖狂进攻，不得不转入以反击右派为主的阶段。在反右派的斗争取得重大的胜利，同时又在人民群众中开展社会主义的大辩论以后，右派就无法继续捣乱了。而且由于广大群众辨明了是非，提高了觉悟，更加相信我们党，更加靠近我们党，我们就有了更大的把握可以有效地整顿自己的作风，改进党和国家的工作。只要我们的态度是坚决的，行动是迅速的，及时地解决了应该解决和可能解决的问题，党在群众中的威信就会更加提高，它和群众的关系就会更加密切。
    有许多单位在集中主要力量反击右派的同时，就分出了一定的人力，成立了边整边改办公室，专门研究和处理群众的批评和建议，并且已经在群众的积极支持下，解决了一批能够立即解决的问题。例如，国务院第八办公室，最近就曾邀请出席民建中央委员会和全国工商联执行委员会联席会议的全体人员举行座谈会，向他们报告了处理工商界在大鸣大放期间提出的意见的初步结果。广东、福建等省的领导机关在认真研究群众的批评和意见以后，订出了有关生活待遇等的新规定，消除了干部生活中的某些特殊化的现象。全国许多厂矿企业和农村基层组织，根据群众的合理的批评建议，在最近时期用大力处理了许多急需解决的问题。仅据北京市三十一个工厂截至9月5日的统计，就解决了由十多万条意见合并成的三千多个问题。还有一些地方和单位的党组织，把群众提出的意见集中起来，归纳成为几个大问题，成立专题研究小组，分别研究和提出处理意见。这就为系统的整风作好了准备。所有这些作法都获得了群众的好评。群众再一次认识到，我们的党是一个全心全意地为人民服务的政党，他们对于整风运动的信心更加提高了。
    但是，也有不少单位的领导人由于集中力量于反右派斗争，放松了边整边改的任务，至今还没有很好地研究处理群众的意见，还没有进行具体的准备工作以便解决那些必须解决的问题。他们不了解，即使在集中力量反击右派的时候，也应该分出必要的时间和人力，专门研究和处理群众的意见。凡是能解决的问题应该立即解决；凡是暂时不能解决的问题，也应该积极进行准备工作，并且向群众解释清楚，以免群众发生怀疑和失望。不这样作，对于改进工作固然不利，对于深入反右派斗争也是不利的。
    当然，群众提出的有一些问题，例如有关业务方针、组织机构和行政体制等方面的问题，不仅问题复杂，而且牵涉面广，需要经过有关机关商量，或者需要经过高级领导机关慎重考虑，作较长时间的研究后，才能提出妥善的解决方案。在一些牵动全局的问题上草率从事，轻易作出决定，必然造成新的混乱。但是，事实上，群众所提出的多数问题，例如有关机关工作、人事工作等方面的许多问题，特别是有关本单位领导干部和党员干部思想作风方面的问题，不仅在本单位就可以解决，而且很快就可以解决。因此，借口任何困难，而使工作的改进迟迟不前，软弱无力，都是错误的。
    许多单位的改进工作迟迟不前，软弱无力，还有一个重要的原因，就是有少数同志对于工作中的缺点错误的危害认识不足，对于放手发动群众批评、公开接受群众批评的勇气不足。有些同志害怕受了群众批评以后，威信降低了，以后难于工作，或者害怕群众中的错误意见会抬起头来，而坚持正确意见的人们会难于分辨。这些想法显然都是不正确的，而那些已经着手整改的单位所取得的成功的经验，也已经证明事实决不是如此。还有极少数同志，错误地用对待右派分子的办法对待群众中的不成熟的批评，把注意的重点放在“批判”群众中的某些不正确的意见，而不放在热情地支持群众的批评和坚决地依靠群众的力量来整顿作风，改进工作。这种错误的办法尤其必须迅速地纠正。群众的不正确的意见是必须通过辩论和教育来纠正的，但是这只是事情的一个方面，而且同反右派斗争有原则的区别，决不允许混为一谈。对于群众的社会主义教育，并不能够代替领导工作的改进。对于所有单位的领导者说来，当前最重要的问题就是必须划出一定的期间（不能很短），集中力量依靠群众的批评和监督来狠狠地整顿作风，改进工作。对于工作中的一切缺点错误，要同群众站在一起，努力加以揭发和消除。如果这些缺点错误要由自己本人负责，那就更应该大公无私地以身作则地坚决改正，毫不踌躇。
    总之，整顿作风、改进工作和反对右派，是整风运动的两个不可分离的组成部分。我们不但必须狠狠地打击右派，而且必须狠狠地整顿作风，改进工作。反对右派不能允许温情主义和草率收兵，改进工作也不能允许温情主义和草率收兵。只有两方面的斗争都进行得坚决彻底，才能达到整风运动的目的，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业大大地向前推进一步，也才能大大加强党和广大人民群众的团结，彻底孤立右派。只有这样，才能争取运动的全胜。
