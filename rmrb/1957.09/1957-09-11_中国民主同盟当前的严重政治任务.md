The Democratic Parties Must Carry the Anti-Rightist Struggle Through to the End
    Strive to Transform into Political Parties Truly Serving Socialism
　　The Current Serious Political Task of the China Democratic League
　　Chairman of the China Democratic League, Shen Junru
    At this crucial moment when various democratic parties are carrying out the anti-Rightist struggle, the People's Daily published a historically significant editorial: "The Serious Task of the Democratic Parties." The anti-Rightist struggle of the democratic parties is a shocking class struggle to change the political landscape and reverse the political direction, and it is also a turning point for fundamental transformation. The People's Daily editorial gives the democratic parties tremendous encouragement and sharp spiritual weapons, enabling them to confidently carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end and prepare conditions for their own fundamental transformation. On behalf of the China Democratic League, I sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party for its guidance.
    The China Democratic League played a particularly egregious role during the frantic attack on the Party, the people, and socialism by the bourgeois Rightists. This is because, for a period, the Rightist reactionary line of the "Zhang-Luo Alliance," formed by the two vice-chairmen of the China Democratic League, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji—from the political line to the organizational line—once gained the upper hand within the League.
  The core members of the "Zhang-Luo Alliance" controlled the real power of the leading organs of the Central Committee and many local organizations of the China Democratic League to varying degrees and in different situations. They also participated in leadership work in many sectors of national life, especially in the cultural and educational sectors. They, as well as the large and small Rightists under their influence, used the legitimate status of the China Democratic League organization and the opportunity to help the Party rectify its style of work, acted as commanders and big and small ringleaders across the country and in local areas, in higher education, scientific, journalistic, publishing, cultural and artistic circles, and other fields, planning, launching, calling for, and organizing the frantic attack of the bourgeois Rightists. The "Zhang-Luo Alliance" in fact became the supreme command post issuing orders for anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities nationwide, committing serious crimes against the Party, the people, and the socialist cause.
      The exposure of the political conspiracy of the "Zhang-Luo Alliance" and the political faces of the Rightist elements of the China Democratic League, of course, greatly surprised us and cannot but make us deeply regretful. However, as the People's Daily editorial pointed out, these are not accidental, they all have deep social class roots and historical roots, and they were inevitable. The main members of the China Democratic League are senior intellectuals. They generally come from bourgeois backgrounds, and many are representative figures among them. With the exception of a small number of these senior intellectuals who have politically abandoned the capitalist stance and resolutely support socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party, most have not yet abandoned their bourgeois stance and are still wavering between taking the socialist road or the capitalist road, and their support for the leadership of the Communist Party is by no means sincere. The Rightists among the bourgeois intellectuals resolutely oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose taking the socialist road, and demand the realization of bourgeois democracy and the restoration of the capitalist system. They are the backbone and spokespersons of the bourgeois Rightists. Because of blood ties, they are still able to incite, deceive, and utilize the middle-of-the-roaders among the bourgeois intellectuals to a great extent. This explains why the reactionary political program of the "Zhang-Luo Alliance" was able to gain varying degrees of sympathy and resonance from many senior intellectual members, and it also explains why the Rightist backbone members of the China Democratic League were able to exert such a strong destructive effect on a national scale during the frantic attack of the bourgeois Rightists.
    Due to this serious situation in organization and politics, the anti-Rightist struggle is a major test for the China Democratic League. Under the leadership and help of the Communist Party, the Central Committee and local organizations of the China Democratic League have established core rectification leadership teams with Leftists as the backbone, implementing the policy of relying on the Leftists, uniting and educating the middle-of-the-roaders to turn to the Left, and have achieved preliminary results in the anti-Rightist struggle. However, although the "Zhang-Luo Alliance" and various Rightist cliques have disintegrated, they have not been completely smashed; although the reactionary words and deeds of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Rightist backbone members have been exposed in large quantities, they have not truly bowed their heads and confessed their crimes; although the League members in the middle state have received some class education to varying degrees, they have not completely drawn a line between themselves and the Rightists and have not resolutely joined the battle. Therefore, the leading organs of the Central Committee and the provincial and municipal committees of the China Democratic League must continue to deepen the anti-Rightist struggle, make persistent efforts, and achieve complete victory. At the same time, they must also take active steps to universally launch the anti-Rightist struggle in grassroots organizations, so that the vast number of League members can receive a profound education in "destroying the capitalist stance and establishing the socialist stance."
    In order to change the political face and organizational face of the China Democratic League, in order to transform the political stance of League members, in order to make the China Democratic League a political force that truly serves socialism and the workers and peasants, it is necessary to carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end, deeper and deeper. This is the decisive key to whether the China Democratic League can coexist with the Communist Party for a long time and supervise each other. This is the most serious and most urgent political task of the China Democratic League at present. I believe that as long as we resolutely support and sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party, the vast majority of League members will be able to withstand the test of socialism, and the China Democratic League will be able to complete this historical task.

### 中国民主同盟当前的严重政治任务

　　各民主党派必须把反右派斗争进行到底
    努力改造成真正为社会主义服务的政党
　　中国民主同盟当前的严重政治任务
　　中国民主同盟主席　沈钧儒
    正当各民主党派进行反右派斗争的重要关头，人民日报发表了具有历史意义的社论：“各民主党派的严重任务”。各民主党派的反右派斗争是改变政治面貌和扭转政治方向的一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，也是进行根本改造的转折点。人民日报的社论给各民主党派以巨大的鼓舞力量和锐利的精神武器，使它们能够有信心地把反右派斗争进行到底，为自己的根本改造准备条件。我代表中国民主同盟，衷心感谢中国共产党的指引。
    中国民主同盟在资产阶级右派向党、向人民、向社会主义的猖狂进攻中，起了特别恶劣的影响和作用。这是因为在一个时期内，由民盟两个副主席章伯钧、罗隆基所形成的“章罗联盟”的右派反动路线——从政治路线到组织路线，曾经在盟内占了上风。
  “章罗联盟”的骨干分子在不同情况下和不同程度上控制了民盟中央和许多地方组织的领导机关的实权。他们在国家生活的许多部门特别是文教部门还参加了领导工作。他们以及在他们影响下的大小右派分子，利用民盟组织的合法地位，利用帮助党整风的机会，在全国和地方上，在高教界、科学界、新闻界、出版界、文化艺术界和其他方面，充当主帅和大小头目，筹划、发动、号召和组织资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻。“章罗联盟”事实上成为全国反党、反人民、反社会主义发号施令的最高司令部，对党、对人民、对社会主义事业犯下了严重的罪行。
      “章罗联盟”政治阴谋和民盟右派分子政治面貌的大暴露，固然使我们大吃一惊，并且不能不深自疚责。但是，正如人民日报的社论所指出，这都非事出偶然，都具有深刻的社会阶级根源和历史根源，都是不可避免地要发生的。民盟的主要成员是高级知识分子。他们一般都是资产阶级出身，很多还是其中的代表人物。这些高级知识分子除一小部分人在政治上已经抛弃了资本主义立场、坚决拥护社会主义和共产党的领导以外，基本上还没有抛弃他们的资产阶级立场，对走社会主义的道路或者走资本主义的道路还是动摇的，对共产党的领导也决不是心悦诚服的。资产阶级知识分子中的右派则坚决反对共产党的领导，反对走社会主义的道路，要求实现资产阶级民主和复辟资本主义制度。他们是资产阶级右派的骨干和代言人。因为血脉相通，他们在很大程度上还能够煽惑、蒙蔽和利用资产阶级知识分子的中间派。这说明“章罗联盟”的反动政治纲领为什么能够取得许多高级知识分子成员的不同程度的同情和共鸣，也说明民盟右派骨干分子为什么能够在资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻中，在全国范围内发生如此强烈的破坏性作用。
    由于组织上和政治上的这种严重情况，所以反右派斗争对于中国民主同盟是一次重大的考验。在共产党的领导和帮助下，民盟中央和地方组织已经建立了以左派为骨干的整风领导核心，执行依靠左派、团结和教育中间派向左转的方针，在反右派斗争中取得了初步的战果。但是，“章罗联盟”和形形色色的右派集团虽然已经瓦解，却还没有被彻底粉碎；章伯钧、罗隆基和右派骨干分子的反动言行虽然已被大量揭露，却还没有真正低头认罪；处于中间状态的盟员虽然或多或少地受到了阶级教育，却还没有同右派完全划清界限，还没有坚决地投入战斗。因此，民盟中央和省市委员会的领导机关还必须使反右派的斗争继续深入，再接再厉，取得全胜，同时还必须采取积极的步骤，在基层组织中普遍地展开反右派斗争，使广大盟员受到一次“破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场”的深刻教育。
    为了改变民盟的政治面貌和组织面貌，为了改造盟员的政治立场，为了使民盟成为真正为社会主义和工农服务的政治力量，一定要把反右派斗争进行到底，深入再深入。这是民盟能否同共产党长期共存、互相监督的决定性关键。这是民盟当前最严重最迫切的政治任务。我相信只要坚决拥护和诚恳接受共产党的领导，极大多数盟员是能够经受过社会主义这一关的考验的，民盟是能够完成这个历史任务的。
