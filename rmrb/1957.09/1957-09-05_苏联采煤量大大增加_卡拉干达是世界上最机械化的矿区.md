Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th – Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet Union's coal production has greatly increased. In the first seven months, the national coal production increased by more than 21 million tons compared with the same period last year. It is estimated that the total coal production in the Soviet Union during this period has exceeded 250 million tons, which is much more than the total coal production in the entire year of 1949.

According to reports in local newspapers, almost all coal regions in the Soviet Union have overfulfilled their coal production plans in the past few months. In the first seven months alone, they over-fulfilled the state plan by more than 3.3 million tons of coal.

To reward the contributions made to the country in developing the coal mining industry, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently decided to award various medals and orders to more than 7,000 advanced miners and coal mine builders, and to award the title of Hero of Socialist Labor to 137 miners and coal mine workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th – An article in the Soviet "Labor News" stated that the Karaganda coal region of the Kazakh Republic has now become the most mechanized coal region in the world. In this coal region, about 65% of the coal's entire production process is mechanized. In another two years, all coal loading, coal transportation, and tunnel excavation work in this coal region will be done by machines.

In the United States, even now, the coal mining technology level of more than 6,000 coal mines has remained at the level of the Karaganda coal region's coal mines before the October Revolution.

    苏联采煤量大大增加
    卡拉干达是世界上最机械化的矿区
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　今年以来，苏联的煤产量有了很大的增加。在头七个月中，全国采煤量比去年同时期增加了两千一百万吨以上。据计算，全苏联总产煤量在这期间已经超过了二亿五千万吨，比1949年全年的煤产量多得多。
    据此间报纸报道：在过去几个月中，全苏联所有煤区差不多都超额完成了采煤计划，它们单是在头七个月中为国家超计划开采的煤就有三百三十多万吨。
    为了奖励在发展采煤工业方面对国家所作的贡献，苏联最高苏维埃主席团最近决定授予七千多个先进的矿工和煤矿建设者以各种勋章和奖章，并且授予一百三十七个矿工和煤矿工作人员以社会主义劳动英雄称号。
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联“劳动报”上的一篇文章说，哈萨克共和国的卡拉干达煤区现在已经成为全世界机械化程度最高的煤区。在这个煤区出产的煤中，约有65％的煤的整个生产过程是机械化的。再过两年，这个煤区的装煤、运煤和巷道掘进工作将全部用机器来做。
    在美国，直到现在还有六千多个煤矿的采煤技术水平一直停留在十月革命以前卡拉干达煤区各煤矿的采煤技术水平上。
