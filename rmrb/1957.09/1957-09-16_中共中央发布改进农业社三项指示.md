　　CCP Central Committee Directive on Rectifying Agricultural Production Cooperatives
　　September 14, 1957

    The great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism has been gradually unfolding in the rural areas of the country. The Central Committee believes that, with the help of the work groups of the higher-level party committees, agricultural cooperatives in various localities should, following this great debate, continue to carry out a series of rectification works.
    (1) Rectify the work style of cadres. The vast majority of cadres in agricultural cooperatives are basically good. They are active in their work and have made achievements. However, among them, many have certain shortcomings or errors in their contact with the masses, handling finances, managing production, and dealing with personnel matters. As for those who violate laws and discipline and make serious mistakes, they account for only a very small number. The rectification of the work style of cadres is to help them correct their shortcomings and errors in their work, improve their working methods, enhance their working ability, and raise their political and ideological levels, and to distinguish the majority of cadres who serve the people wholeheartedly but have certain shortcomings and errors from the very small number of people who violate laws and discipline and make serious mistakes. The deployment of this rectification campaign in various cooperatives can be formulated according to their specific circumstances, but generally, the following practices should be adopted in order: First, within the cooperative cadres and in the Party and League branches, fully explain the necessity of the rectification campaign, explaining that the relationship between the Party and the masses is like that between fish and water, so that the cadres and Party and League members are mentally prepared. Second, let the members freely criticize the shortcomings or errors of the cadres at the members' representative assembly, the production team's general meeting, or the general members' meeting. Third, organize small meetings with the participation of mass representatives to ascertain the facts, distinguish the size and severity of the shortcomings and errors, distinguish responsibilities, and then have the person who made the mistake make a self-criticism at a certain mass meeting. Matters that are misunderstood by the masses should be clarified. If landlords, rich peasants, speculators, counter-revolutionaries, and hooligans take the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities, it is necessary to rely on the masses to expose them on appropriate occasions. Fourth, the Party branch and the higher-level work group should, in accordance with the principles of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient, study the handling plan with the masses. With the understanding of the masses, cadres who have not made serious mistakes and who are determined to correct them do not need to be given punishment. For those who have made serious mistakes, the punishment should also be appropriate so that they have the opportunity to correct them. Fifth, the re-election of cooperative cadres should be carried out by the members from the bottom up, after full consultation, and a list of candidates should be proposed. The Party branch's leadership in the election should not take the form of designation, but must pay attention to maintaining the advantage of the original poor and lower-middle peasants in the leading component of the cooperative, and at the same time pay attention to ensuring that the upper-middle peasants also have appropriate representatives, in order to consolidate and unite the cooperative.
    (2) Adjust the organization of the cooperatives and teams. The organization of cooperatives and production teams should strive to facilitate management and give play to the enthusiasm of the members' collective labor. To this end, their organizational scale should take into account regional conditions, economic conditions, living conditions, and historical conditions, allowing for various differences, and should not be uniform. According to more than a year of experience, in most cases, one cooperative per village is more appropriate. Some large villages can have several cooperatives per village, and some small villages that are close to each other can also have several villages per cooperative. The organization of cooperatives in various localities (including some large cooperatives), which has already been tested, is indeed well-run, and is satisfactory to the masses, should be stabilized and should not be changed easily. However, the organizational scale of some cooperatives is too large and inappropriate, and should be reasonably adjusted according to the requirements of the masses, either by reducing the size of the cooperative, or by maintaining the form of a joint cooperative, with the branch cooperatives (some called brigades) being responsible for their own profits and losses. The production team is the basic production unit of the cooperative, and is generally suitable for about twenty households. According to the characteristics of each locality, it can be expanded or contracted, too large to be easily managed, and too small will damage the superiority of collective labor. When adjusting the organization of cooperatives and teams, attention must be paid to the opinions and interests of all sections of the masses. After full consultation, mutual assistance and mutual concession should be promoted, differences should be mediated, and economic issues such as land, farm tools, draught animals, water conservancy, and trees should be properly handled. After carefully adjusting the organization of cooperatives and teams, they should all be stabilized for a long time to facilitate production and construction.
    On the issue of the relationship between cooperatives and teams, the principle of unified management and decentralized administration should be implemented. It is necessary to overcome the drawbacks of excessive centralization in some cooperatives and to prevent the tendency of production teams having too much power and forming decentralism.
    (3) Make overall arrangements so that all members are properly placed. After cooperativization, except for disaster areas, the income of most members has increased to varying degrees, and some members have only maintained their original income level, but a small number of members have temporarily reduced their income due to insufficient labor or other reasons. For those households in difficulty who lack labor, they should be properly arranged to work in the cooperative or properly helped to develop household sideline occupations in accordance with the principle of mutual assistance. For the "five guarantees" households, they should also be assigned some possible light work according to their ability so that they can receive a certain labor income. Only when the labor income is insufficient, should the cooperative provide care with public welfare funds. For well-to-do middle peasants, except for a very small number who firmly demand to withdraw from the cooperative, they can be allowed to withdraw from the cooperative after appropriate criticism. In accordance with the principle of mutual benefit, the payment for their joining the cooperative’s means of production (e.g., farm tools, draught animals, fruit trees, etc.) should be returned on schedule; or, after consultation and mass discussion, according to different situations, and on the condition that the basic interests of the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants are not harmed, take proportional dividends or other compromising methods, deal with the legacy issues of their joining the cooperative’s means of production, so that they can get appropriate income. For old peasants with rich labor experience and high production technology, their special skills should be brought into play and they should be given reasonable remuneration according to their contribution to production. For members engaged in handicrafts, transportation, fishing, and other non-agricultural labor, their labor characteristics should be taken into account and various related issues should be properly handled so that they can receive reasonable income.
    (4) Improve production management and formulate production plans. The improvement and enhancement of the lives of all members can only rely on their own hard work and the continuous expansion of reproduction by the cooperative. The rectification of the cooperative must not delay production. On the basis of correctly handling various internal contradictions, the cooperatives in various localities should summarize their own experience, refer to the experience of other cooperatives, earnestly implement the Central Committee's notice on several matters concerning democratic cooperative management in accordance with the policy of democratic cooperative management and diligent and thrifty cooperative management, and improve production management in light of specific circumstances in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions on doing a good job in the production management of cooperatives, and overcome shortcomings. At the same time, all members should be mobilized to discuss the draft national agricultural development program, and in accordance with the characteristics of their own cooperative, study measures to increase agricultural production and develop diversified economies, and formulate realistic production plans for the next year and long-term, as a goal for all members to strive for. The cooperative's formulation of production plans must be subject

### 中共中央发布改进农业社三项指示

　　紧接社会主义大辩论，进行一系列整顿工作
　　中共中央发布改进农业社三项指示
　　中共中央关于整顿农业生产合作社的指示
　　一九五七年九月十四日
    关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论，已经在全国农村中逐步展开。中央认为：各地农业合作社应该在上级党委工作组的帮助下，接着这个大辩论，继续进行一系列的整顿工作。
    （一）整顿干部作风。农业合作社绝大多数的干部基本上是好的，他们在工作上是积极的，有成绩的。但是在他们中间，有不少的人，在联系群众、经手财政、管理生产、处理人事等问题上存在着某些缺点或错误。至于违法乱纪、错误严重的，则只占极少数。整顿干部作风，就是要帮助他们改正工作上的缺点和错误，改善工作方法，提高工作能力，提高政治水平和思想水平，并把那些全心全意为人民服务而带有某些缺点和错误的多数干部，同那些违法乱纪、严重错误的极少数人分别开来。各地合作社对于这个整风的部署，可以按照自己的具体情况拟定，但大体上要依序采取如下的做法：第一，先在合作社干部中，在党团支部中，充分说明整风的必要性，说明党群关系好比鱼水关系，使干部们和党团员在精神上有所准备。第二，放手让社员群众在社员代表大会上，生产队全体会议上，或全体社员会议上，对干部的缺点或错误提出批评。第三，组织有群众代表参加的小型会议，查清事实，分别缺点错误的大小轻重，分清责任，然后由犯错误的人在一定的群众会议上作自我检讨。属于群众误会的事，应该解释清楚。如果有地主、富农、投机商、反革命分子和流氓分子乘机进行破坏活动，必须依靠群众，在适当场合加以揭穿。第四，党支部和上级工作组要按照惩前毖后（戒于前而慎于后）、治病救人的原则，同群众在一起研究处理的方案。在群众的谅解之下，对错误并不严重而又表示决心改正的干部，不必给予处分，对于错误严重的，处分也要适当，使他们得有改正的机会。第五，合作社干部的改选，应该由社员群众自下而上地层层酝酿，充分协商，提出候选人名单。党支部在选举方面的领导，不能采取指定的做法，但必须注意使合作社的领导成份保持原来贫雇农和下中农的优势，同时注意使上中农也有适当的代表人，以利合作社的巩固和团结。
    （二）调整社和队的组织。合作社和生产队的组织，要力求便于经营管理和发挥社员集体劳动的积极性。为此，它们的组织规模大小，应该照顾地区条件、经济条件、居住条件和历史条件，容许有各种差别，而不应该千篇一律。根据一年多的经验看来，在多数的情况下，一村一社是比较适当的。有些大村可以一村数社，有些距离较近的小村也可以数村一社。现在各地合作社的组织（包括某些大社在内），凡是业已经过考验，确实办好，而为群众所满意的，就应该稳定下来，不要轻易变动。但是，有一部分合作社的组织规模是过大的，不适当的，应该根据群众的要求，进行合理的调整，或者把社划小，或者保持联社的形式，由分社（有的叫大队）自负盈亏。生产队是合作社的基本生产单位，一般以二十户左右为适宜，按照各地方的特点，可以有所伸缩，过大不便管理，过小会损害集体劳动的优越性。在调整社和队的组织的时候，必须注意各部分群众的意见和利益，经过充分的协商，提倡互助互让，调解分歧，恰当处理土地、农具、耕畜、水利、林木等等经济问题。在慎重地调整社和队的组织之后，就都应当长期稳定下来，以利生产和建设。
    在社、队关系的问题上，应该实行统一经营、分级管理的原则，既要克服某些合作社过分集权的弊病，也要防止生产队权限过大、形成分散主义的偏向。
    （三）统筹安排，使全体社员各得其所。合作化后，除了灾区以外，大多数社员在不同程度上增加了收入，有一部分社员还只保持原来收入的水平，但是，也有一小部分社员因为劳动力不足或其他原因而暂时减少收入。对于其中缺乏劳动力的困难户，应该根据互助原则，适当安排他们在社内的劳动，或者适当帮助他们发展家庭副业。对于五保户，也应该根据他们的能力，分配一些可能的轻便的工作，使他们能够得到一定的劳动收入，只在劳动收入不足的情况下，才由社用公益金给予照顾。对于富裕中农，除极少数坚决要求退社的，可以在适当批评之后允许退社以外，应该根据互利原则，按期归还他们入社生产资料（例如，农具、耕畜、果木，等）折价的款项；或者经过协商和群众讨论，按照不同情况，在不损害贫农、下中农基本利益的条件下，采取比例分红或其他可以妥协的办法，处理他们入社生产资料的遗留问题，使他们得到适当的收入。对于有丰富劳动经验和较高生产技术的老农，要发挥他们的特长，按照他们在生产上的贡献，给以合理的报酬。对于从事手工业、运输业、渔业和其他非农业劳动的社员，应该照顾他们的劳动特点，适当处理有关的各种问题，使他们得到合理的收入。
    （四）改善生产管理，拟定生产规划。全体社员生活的改善和提高，只有依靠自己的辛勤劳动，依靠合作社不断地扩大再生产。整社工作必须不误生产。在正确处理内部各种矛盾的基础上，各地合作社应该总结本社的经验，参考其他合作社的经验，根据民主办社和勤俭办社的方针，认真执行中央关于民主办社几个事项的通知，并根据中央关于做好合作社生产管理工作的指示，结合具体情况改进生产管理工作，克服缺点。同时，要发动全体社员，讨论全国农业发展纲要草案，并且根据本地本社的特点，研究增加农业生产和发展多种经济的措施，实事求是地拟定下年度和长期的生产规划，作为全体社员努力奋斗的目标。合作社拟定生产规划，必须服从国家经济计划和政策的指导，尊重其他合作社的利益，避免本位主义。生产规划应着重利用本社的劳动力，进行农业的基本建设，例如兴修水利，保持水土，改良土壤，植树造林等等，为扩大再生产准备必要的条件。
    以上的整社工作，应该从现在起到明年春耕以前，逐步进行。这是巩固合作制度的重大关键。各地党委必须加强领导，完成这个任务。
