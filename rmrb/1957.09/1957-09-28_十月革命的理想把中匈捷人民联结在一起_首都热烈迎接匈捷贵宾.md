Xinhua News Agency, September 27th. The government delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic headed by Prime Minister Kádár, the delegation of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic headed by Chairman Fierlinger, and the delegation of the Central People's Committee of Prague headed by Mayor Svoboda arrived in Beijing by the same plane this afternoon.

The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed at the airport by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Today, the national flags of China, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia fluttered over Beijing Airport. At 3:30 p.m., the giant jet carrying the distinguished guests landed slowly, and applause and cheers resounded throughout the welcoming crowd. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, among others, walked to the front of the plane and shook hands with the distinguished guests as they disembarked amidst cheers and military music.

Then, Prime Minister Kádár, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor. Chairman Fierlinger, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, also participated in the review.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Liu Shaoqi delivered welcoming speeches at the airport, and Prime Minister Kádár and Chairman Fierlinger also spoke. They all emphasized the need to strengthen the unity between socialist countries. (See page 4 for the full text of the above speeches)

In his welcoming speech to the Hungarian government delegation, Premier Zhou said that the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people, built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, is unbreakable. He also said that the visit to China by the Hungarian government delegation headed by Prime Minister Kádár will further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, and will also make a significant contribution to strengthening the unity of socialist countries and safeguarding the noble cause of world peace.

In his speech, Prime Minister Kádár said: "The imperialists have not been able to conquer the Hungarian People's Republic because this country has such strong friends as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China." He also said: "The imperialists' attack on Hungary aimed at disintegrating and splitting the socialist camp, and separating the people of Hungary, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries from each other. The imperialist conspiracy did not succeed, and our unity and friendship with the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries have stood the test, and this unity and friendship is stronger today than before the attack."

In his welcoming speech to the delegation of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic and the delegation of the Central People's Committee of Prague, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the people of China and Czechoslovakia have provided mutual support in the cause of building socialism, which has further consolidated and developed the deep friendship between the two peoples. He also said that through direct contact between the parliaments of China and Czechoslovakia, the friendship between the two peoples will be enhanced, the unity of socialist countries will be strengthened, and it will be beneficial to the noble cause of world peace.

Chairman Fierlinger said in his speech that the visit of the National People's Congress delegation headed by Peng Zhen to Czechoslovakia and the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation led by Prime Minister Široký to China have greatly consolidated the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia. He said that what connects China and Czechoslovakia is the ideal of the great October Socialist Revolution, and the Czechoslovak people will always be loyal to this ideal and firmly stand on the western front of the socialist camp to defend the security of the socialist camp and world peace. Chairman Fierlinger finally shouted "Long live the People's China" in Chinese.

The speeches of Prime Minister Kádár and Chairman Fierlinger were constantly interrupted by prolonged applause.

After the speeches, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and others, circled the airport to meet the welcoming crowds. At this time, in the welcoming crowd, deafening applause and slogans of friendship between the three peoples rose one after another, and many gorgeously dressed young women continuously presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

Also present at the airport today to welcome the guests were Vice Premiers Chen Yun, Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, He Long, Li Xiannian, Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Chen Shutong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, as well as heads of various government departments, democratic parties, people's organizations, generals, and responsible persons of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

    十月革命的理想把中匈捷人民联结在一起
    首都热烈迎接匈捷贵宾
    新华社27日讯　　以卡达尔总理为首的匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团、以费林格主席为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会代表团和以斯沃波达市长为首的布拉格市中央人民委员会代表团，今天下午同机到达北京。
    贵宾们在机场受到了刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理和首都各界人民的热烈欢迎。
    今天，北京机场上飘扬着中、匈、捷三国的国旗。下午三时半，贵宾们乘坐的巨型喷气专机徐徐着陆，欢迎群众中鼓掌声和欢呼声响彻云霄。刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理等走到飞机的前面，在一片欢呼和军乐声中同走下飞机的贵宾们一一握手致意。
    接着，卡达尔总理由周恩来总理陪同，检阅了仪仗队。费林格主席由刘少奇委员长陪同，也参加了检阅。

    周总理致词欢迎匈牙利政府代表团。他说，建筑在无产阶级国际主义基础上的中匈两国人民之间的友谊是牢不可破的。他还说，这次以卡达尔总理为首的匈牙利政府代表团的访问中国，一定会进一步发展我们两国间的友好合作关系，同时对于加强社会主义各国的团结和维护世界和平的崇高事业也一定会作出重大的贡献。
    卡达尔总理在讲话中说：“帝国主义者们没有能够征服匈牙利人民共和国，因为这个国家有像苏联和中华人民共和国这样强大的朋友。”他还说：“帝国主义者们对匈牙利的进攻，其目的在于瓦解和分裂社会主义阵营，使匈牙利、苏联和中华人民共和国以及其他国家的人民互相分离。帝国主义的阴谋没有成功，我们与苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家的团结和友谊经得住考验，这种团结和友谊今天比遭受进攻以前更加坚强了。”

    费林格主席讲话说，以彭真为首的全国人民代表大会代表团的访问捷克斯洛伐克，由西罗基总理率领的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的访问中国，大大地巩固了中捷两国之间的友谊。他说，把中捷两国联系在一起的是伟大十月社会主义革命的理想，捷克斯洛伐克人民将永远忠于这个理想，坚定地站在社会主义阵营的西方前线保卫社会主义阵营的安全和世界和平。费林格主席最后还用汉语高呼人民中国万岁。
    卡达尔总理和费林格主席的讲话，不断被长时间的掌声打断。
