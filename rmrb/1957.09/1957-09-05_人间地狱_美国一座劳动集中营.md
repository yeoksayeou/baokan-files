    Living Hell
    -- An American Labor Camp
    "Stone Mountain Convict Camp"
    Forty miles from Atlanta, Georgia, USA, stands a cross-shaped brick building. This is the location of Georgia's grim and terrifying labor camp. The "Stone Mountain Convict Camp" holds 187 so-called "incorrigible" criminals. In 1956 alone, 53 prisoners broke their ankles with large quarrying hammers, and another nine prisoners attempted to escape without success. In July of the same year, fourteen prisoners simultaneously injured their ankles with large hammers, creating the highest record of collective self-harm by prisoners in American prison history, which attracted the attention of the American public. However, under the cover-up of the American judicial authorities, the truth about "Stone Mountain Convict Camp" has not been fully exposed. Until recently, when the American "Nation Weekly" published a communication, people realized that the so-called "Stone Mountain Convict Camp" was a living hell.

    Under the Threat of Whips and Guns
    The "Stone Mountain Convict Camp" held its inauguration ceremony in 1951. At the ceremony, American officials proudly declared that the original construction cost of one million US dollars only used more than one hundred thousand dollars, because most of the construction work was undertaken by the prisoners themselves. It turned out that under the threat of whips and guns, the prisoners carried out cruel forced labor and endured shocking exploitation. During the construction period, there were constant incidents of attempts to escape due to unbearable abuse. Although the person in charge of the prisoner camp announced that "all escaping prisoners will be killed without mercy," escape incidents still occurred from time to time.

      Inhuman Treatment
    Every morning at six o'clock, the prisoners of "Stone Mountain Convict Camp" are transported from the camp to the mine in trucks equipped with barbed wire to work on quarrying. Before getting into the truck, they must take off their prison uniforms and run naked across an open field to another house to put on work clothes. At six o'clock in the afternoon, when they return from the mine, they take off their work clothes and still run naked back to their rooms to put on their prison uniforms again, rain or shine. It is said that this is to facilitate the "inspection" of whether the prisoners are carrying anything.
    When prisoners are working, they are monitored by guards carrying automatic rifles. They are closely guarded even when using the toilet. The toilet in the mine is a gully. Whenever a prisoner needs to use the toilet, he is escorted by an armed guard. During the round trip, the guards can freely fire their guns "for practice."
    The place where prisoners live is extremely narrow. Every night, they are crammed into the bedroom like sardines in a can.
    Unable to withstand this inhuman forced labor and abuse, the prisoners decided to collectively injure themselves. The prison authorities not only did not study ways to improve the situation, but instead declared that all self-injured prisoners were lazy people, "and will resume work immediately after recovery" and are only allowed to gnaw on dry bread and drink plain boiled water.

    人间地狱
    ——美国一座劳动集中营
    “石矿山囚犯营”
    距美国佐治亚州亚特兰大城四十英里的地方，有一座十字形的砖造建筑物。这就是佐治亚州阴森恐怖的劳动集中营的所在。这所名叫“石矿山囚犯营”的劳动集中营，囚禁了所谓“屡犯不改”的罪犯一百八十七名。1956年一年间，先后共有五十三名囚犯用采石的大铁锤打碎了自己的脚踝，另外九名囚犯企图越狱未遂。同年7月，十四名囚犯同时用大铁锤打伤了自己的脚踝，造成美国监狱史上囚犯集体自伤的最高纪录，因此引起美国公众的注意。不过在美国司法当局的掩饰下，“石矿山囚犯营”的真相还没有充分暴露。直到最近，美国“民族周刊”发表了一篇通讯，人们才看出所谓“石矿山囚犯营”竟是一座人间地狱。
    在鞭子与枪口的威胁下
    “石矿山囚犯营”是在1951年举行落成典礼的。在落成典礼上，美国官员很骄傲地宣称，原定的美金一百万元的建筑费只用了十多万元，因为大部分的建筑工程是由囚犯自己担任的。原来在鞭子与枪口的威胁下，囚犯们进行了残酷的强迫劳动，忍受了惊人的剥削。在工程进行时期，就不断地有不堪虐待企图逃跑的事件发生。囚犯营的负责人虽然宣布对逃跑的囚犯“一律格杀无赦”，但是逃跑的事件仍旧不时发生。
      惨无人道的待遇
    “石矿山囚犯营”的囚犯，每天早上六点钟就由装有铁丝网的货车由营地运到矿山去作采石的工作。他们在上车以前必需脱掉囚犯的号衣，赤条条一丝不挂地跑过一段露天的场地到另一所屋子里去穿工作服。下午六点钟由矿山回来，就把工作服脱下，仍旧赤条条一丝不挂地跑回自己的屋子，重新穿上囚犯的号衣，风雨无阻。据说，这样做是便于“检查”囚犯身上是否带有什么东西。
    囚犯在工作的时候，是由携带自动步枪的卫兵监视的。大小便时寸步不离。矿山的厕所是一道山沟。每逢有囚犯需要大小便，就由荷枪的卫兵押送。在往返的途中，卫兵可以自由鸣枪，“以资练习”。
    囚犯居住的地方极为狭窄。每到晚上，他们就像罐头里的沙丁鱼挤在卧室里。
    由于受不了这种惨无人道的强迫劳动和虐待，囚犯们才决定集体自伤。监狱当局不但没有研究改善的办法，反而宣布所有自伤的囚犯都是懒汉，“一旦伤愈，立即复工”并且只许他们啃干面包、喝白开水。
