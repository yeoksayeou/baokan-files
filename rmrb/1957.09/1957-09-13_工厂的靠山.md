　　The Factory's Backing
　　By our reporter Chen Yongjin
      "Without the veteran workers, it is impossible to carry out production well, let alone overfulfill tasks, manufacture new products, or train a large number of skilled new workers. Therefore, we must always pay attention to the work of the veteran workers." This is what the factory director, Party committee secretary, and workshop directors of the Southwest Instrument Factory told me during my visit. They revealed the secret behind the Southwest Instrument Factory's ability to overfulfill production tasks year after year, season after season.
    A characteristic of the Southwest Instrument Factory is that over 90% of its cadres (including workshop directors, the factory director, and the Party committee secretary) have been promoted from veteran workers. This is also an important reason why they can rely on veteran workers to do a good job.
    In recent years, the Southwest Instrument Factory has trial-produced more than twenty categories and about one hundred types of new products. The vast majority of these new products were made by veteran workers, or with veteran workers watching over the young workers. In 1952, when punching holes in a certain tool, only two holes could be punched at a time, which seriously affected the progress of the work. Veteran worker Xu Chunquan designed his own drawings, and as a result, forty-eight holes could be punched each time. When workers encountered difficulties in manufacturing gauge blocks, veteran worker Deng Yizhi, in order to change the original manual manufacturing method into an automated gauge block self-grinding machine, used his spare time to draw blueprints. Without any materials, and only seeing this kind of machinery mentioned in a newspaper from Harbin, he researched it day and night for six months and finally created it, increasing production from six blocks a day to forty-eight blocks. There are too many machine parts that veteran workers have modified, created, and imitated. Take rationalization proposals as an example! Veteran workers, who account for less than 20% of the factory's total workforce, submit 60% of the factory's rationalization proposals. The percentage of young workers violating labor discipline is 3%, while for veteran workers it is only 0.005%. As Comrade Xu Yingshi, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, said, "No matter what the job, it is easy to handle as long as the veteran workers get moving."
    Whenever urgent production tasks arrived, the Southwest Instrument Factory would first convene forums of veteran workers and technical research meetings, so that the veteran workers could lead the young workers. In October 1953, because some raw materials and technical problems could not keep up, the Second Workshop had difficulty completing its task. The Party committee and factory leaders immediately went to this workshop to hold a forum for veteran workers, telling them that failure to complete the task in this workshop would hinder the completion of the task for the entire factory. The veteran workers immediately discussed this production task and decided to improve the equipment to increase production. Some veteran workers led the new workers in doing the work, and as a result, they overfulfilled the task in October.
    In 1953 and 1954, the Southwest Instrument Factory absorbed a large number of new workers. Now, the vast majority of these new workers are grade-four workers, and their improvement in technical ability is inseparable from the guidance of the veteran workers. When these new workers arrived at the workshop, the Party committee and factory leaders conducted education on respecting teachers and loving apprentices between the new and old workers. Most veteran workers and new workers signed apprenticeship contracts. However, some veteran workers still had conservative ideas. Xiong Tinghua was like this at the beginning. He didn't work hard when teaching apprentices, fearing that teaching the apprentice would starve the master. The factory director talked to him repeatedly, telling him: to live a good life and enter socialism, it is necessary to build many new factories. Once the factories are built, there must be many new workers. If veteran workers do not teach new workers, who will the machines in the new factories be handed over to? After the leaders' repeated conversations, Xiong Tinghua felt that the factory was expanding every day, and that these few veteran teachers were not enough. Only then did he break his conservative ideas and signed apprenticeship contracts with four young workers. The Party leaders often taught young workers to help their teachers do some work within their capabilities. After young worker Ma Huiyuan signed an apprenticeship contract with Xiong Tinghua, he would arrive at work early to find the tools and add oil to the machine, ensuring to shorten the teacher's working time. He even helped with some trivial matters in Xiong's family. When Ma Huiyuan joined the Party, he specifically sought Xiong's opinion, asking him to criticize and help him. Xiong Tinghua said, I must learn from you politically, and I hope you will also help me improve.
    Once, when trial-producing a new product, the task could not be completed because the samples were not supplied in time, and veteran worker Lin Xueyou had some complaints. Workshop director Li Jialiang immediately personally sought his opinion. Lin Xueyou said, how can we work if the raw materials are not supplied? Li Jialiang said, the young workers are all looking at the veteran workers, how can we succeed if the veteran workers don't take the lead in finding solutions? The leadership will definitely be responsible for solving the raw material supply problem. After Li Jialiang's mobilization, Lin Xueyou became active. Their group's task was also completed quickly. Veteran worker Li Yunxiang was criticized excessively by the factory director for complaining a bit, and he couldn't think straight for a while and ran away. But when the factory director personally brought him back and apologized to him, he was moved and said: I am also sorry to the factory director, I will definitely work hard and correct my mistakes. Later, he was indeed very active in production, and now he has become an advanced producer in the factory.
    Some veteran workers in this factory had poor health, and some had diseases, because of the poor living conditions in the past. The Party and administrative leaders had long paid attention to these problems. Their sanatorium and nutritional canteen were established to take care of the veteran workers even more. As long as the work is good, even if the health is not good, the production team and the trade union can approve them to eat in the nutritional canteen. The factory subsidizes part of the food expenses every month. The factory has also established a garden tea house according to the characteristics of the veteran workers. Veteran workers can come here to drink tea, chat, listen to storytelling, listen to piano playing, or hold forums after get off work every day.
    In order to help a small number of veteran workers solve their living difficulties, in addition to conducting contraception education for them, the trade union also organizes mutual aid societies among the workers. They organize the families of workers with livelihood difficulties to engage in side occupations, such as raising chickens, raising pigs, growing vegetables, and washing clothes. These measures reduce the worries of veteran workers in life and allow them to concentrate on doing a good job in production. Therefore, although the veteran workers in this factory account for only 20% of the total number of workers in the factory, the veteran workers account for half of the advanced producers.

　　工厂的靠山
　　本报记者　陈勇进
      “没有老工人，想好好地进行生产是不可能的，想超额完成任务，想制造新产品，想培养大批的有技术的新工人那更是梦想。因此我们要时时注意老工人的工作。”我访问西南仪器厂的时候，厂长、党委书记和车间主任等一些同志都这样告诉我。他们道破了西南仪器厂所以能够年年季季超额完成生产任务的秘密。
    西南仪器厂有个特点，那就是90％以上的干部，（其中有车间主任、厂长和党委书记）都是从老工人中提拔出来的。这也是他们能依靠老工人做好工作的重要原因。
    近几年来，西南仪器厂试制了二十多类约一百多种新产品。这些新产品绝大多数都是老工人做的，或老工人在青年工人的身旁看着做的。1952年要在一种工具上冲眼子，当时一下只能冲两个，严重地影响着工作的进展。老工人徐春泉就自己设计图纸，结果每次可以冲四十八个眼子。工人们制造块规遇到困难的时候，老工人邓益志为了把原来手工制造的方法改成自动化的块规自磨机，利用业余时间画图纸，没有资料，仅仅从报纸上看到哈尔滨有这种机械，他日夜的钻研了六个月，终于制成了，使产量从原来的一天造六块增长到四十八块。老工人改造、创造、仿造的机件太多了。就拿合理化建议来说吧！占全厂不到20％的老工人，提的合理化建议却占全厂60％。青年工人违反劳动纪律的有3％，而老工人只有0.005％。正如党委副书记徐应师同志所说的，“不管什么工作，只要老工人动起来就好办了。”
    西南仪器厂每当紧急的生产任务到来的时候，都先召开老工人座谈会，技术研究会，通过老工人带动年青工人。1953年10月份，曾因为一些原材料和技术问题跟不上，二车间完成任务有困难，党委会和厂的领导干部即到这个车间召开老工人座谈会，告诉老工人，这一个车间完不成任务，就会妨碍全厂完成任务。老工人立即讨论了这项生产任务，决定改进设备来提高生产。有些老工人带领着新工人干，结果10月间就超额完成了任务。
    1953年和1954年，西南仪器厂都吸收了大批的新工人。现在这大批大批的新工人绝大部分都是四级工，他们的技术能力的提高，是和老工人的指教分不开的。这些新工人到车间的时候，党委会和厂的领导上在新老工人之间进行了尊师爱徒的教育。大多数老工人和新工人都订立师徒合同。但是，有的老工人还有保守思想。熊庭华开始就是这样，他在教徒弟时不努力，怕教会徒弟饿死师傅。厂长再三地找他谈话，对他说：要过好生活，要进入社会主义，就一定要建设很多新工厂，建了工厂，一定要有很多新工人，老工人不教新工人，新工厂的机器交给谁？经过领导的再三谈话，熊庭华觉得工厂天天在扩大，光这几个老师傅是不行的，才破了保守思想，和四个青年工人订了师徒合同。党的领导常常教导青年工人多帮老师傅干些力所能及的工作。青年工人马惠元在和熊庭华订了师徒合同后，早早上班找好工具，给机器加油，保证缩短老师的工作时间，甚至熊老师家庭的一些琐事，马惠元也去帮助。马惠元入党时特别征求熊老师的意见，请他批评帮助。熊庭华说，我政治上一定要学习你，请你也要帮助我进步。
    有一次试制一个新产品，因为样板供应不上任务完不成，老工人林学友就有意见。车间主任李家亮马上亲自征求他的意见。林学友说原材料供应不上，怎能工作？李家亮说，青年工人都看着老工人，老工人不带头想办法怎成呢？原材料的供应问题，领导上一定负责解决。经过李家亮的动员，林学友就积极起来了。他们小组的任务也很快地就完成了。老工人李云乡因为发了点牢骚，被厂长过火地批评，他一时想不开就跑开了。但当厂长亲自接他回来，并向他道歉以后，他就感动地说：我也对不起厂长，我一定好好工作改正错误。后来，他的确生产非常积极，现在他已经成为厂里的先进生产者。
    这个厂的一些老工人，因为过去生活条件差，身体不好，有的有病。党和行政领导很早就注意了这些问题。他们的疗养院和营养食堂，就是为更多地照顾老工人才设立的。只要工作好，身体不好，生产小组和工会批准就可以去营养食堂吃饭。每月由工厂补贴一部分伙食费。工厂还根据老工人的特点，建立一个花园茶社。老工人每天下班以后，可以到这里来喝茶聊天，听说书，听弹琴，或者开座谈会。
    工会为了帮助少数老工人解决生活困难问题，除对他们进行避孕教育外，还在工人中组织互助会。他们组织生活有困难的工人家属搞副业，如养鸡、养猪、种菜和洗衣等。这些措施，减少了老工人在生活上的忧虑，集中精力搞好生产。所以，这个厂的老工人虽然只占全厂工人数的20％，但在先进生产者中，老工人却占了一半。　（陈志插图）
