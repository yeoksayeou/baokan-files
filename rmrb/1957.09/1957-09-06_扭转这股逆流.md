    Reversing This Adverse Current
    The rural population leaving agricultural production to live in cities as "family members" should be said to be an adverse current—it violates the principle of developing productive forces, not only directly reducing productive forces but also consuming much more of them. It requires building many more dormitories, supplying many more goods, consuming much more transportation capacity, and so on.
    Is asking the families of workers to return to the countryside not creating another "ruthless Milky Way"? Originally, the metaphor of the "ruthless Milky Way" was inappropriate. In fact, in our era, working people have more opportunities to reunite with their families than in any previous era. Although we are in an era of great changes in social life and are subject to various limitations, departments strive to provide care for urban workers visiting their families at home and rural family members visiting relatives in the city. (Some units had shortcomings in this area of work in the past, which should of course be corrected.)
    The most important thing is still labor production. We are human beings and cannot live well without engaging in production all day long. Even the gods and goddesses in people's fantasies, such as the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, have to engage in farming and weaving, and still have "unfree" things like the Milky Way separating them. How can our real life only seek to be together all day long without engaging in production? Allowing some family members who can return to the countryside to participate in production is not only beneficial to industry but also more beneficial to agriculture. This is the only way to make all the people live better. When the adverse current is reversed, it will become part of the surging main current of socialist construction.
    The fact that the families of employees of the financial and trade departments in Chaoyang County are returning home to participate in production shows that reducing the urban population that does not directly participate in production is possible—the key lies in solving the ideological problems of employees and their families. At the same time, leading cadres must set an example; some specific problems of employees and their families must be effectively resolved. If we are resolute in all these aspects, we can avoid being divorced from the masses and do this thing well.

### 扭转这股逆流

    扭转这股逆流
    农村人口脱离农业生产到城市去住着“当家属”，这应当说是一股逆流——它违背了发展生产力的原则，不但直接减少了生产力，而且要多消耗许多生产力。要多盖许多宿舍，多供应许多商品，多耗费许多运输力，等等。
    要职工家属回农村去，这不又成了“无情的天河”吗？本来，“无情的天河”的比喻就是不妥的。事实上，劳动人民一家人团聚在一起的机会，在我们这个时代，比过去任何时代是更多了而不是更少了。虽然正处在社会生活大变动的时代，并且受着各种条件的限制，但是，对于城市职工回家探亲，在乡村的家属到城市探望亲人，各部门却是力求予以照顾的。（有些单位过去在这方面的工作有缺点，那当然应该纠正。）
    最重要的还是劳动生产。我们是人，不能逍遥终日不事生产而又能很好地生活下去。人们幻想出来的神仙，牛郎织女也要从事耕织，也还有天河相隔之类“不自由”的事情，何况我们的现实生活，岂能只图终日相聚而不事生产？让一部分可能回农村的家属回乡参加生产，既有利于工业，更有利于农业，这样才有可能使全体人民都生活得更好。逆流扭转了，它就会成为社会主义建设的澎湃的主流的一部分。
    朝阳县县城财贸部门职工家属纷纷回家参加生产的事实说明：减少不直接参加生产的城市人口是可以做到的——关键在于解决职工及其家属的思想问题。同时，领导干部必须以身作则；对职工及其家属的一些具体问题必须切实解决。在这几方面都做得很坚决，就可以避免脱离群众，就可以把这件事情办得很好。
