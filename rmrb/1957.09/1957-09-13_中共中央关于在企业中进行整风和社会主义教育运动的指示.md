　　CCP Central Committee's Directive on Conducting Rectification and Socialist Education Movement in Enterprises
　　(September 12, 1957)

　　Using big-character posters, debate meetings, criticism and self-criticism to carry out rectification and socialist education movement has created many exemplary cases in some urban enterprises. These examples prove the following points:

　　(1) The Party's consistent policy of trusting the majority of the masses is completely correct;

　　(2) The workers raising questions, offering opinions, presenting facts, and reasoning things out has rapidly improved their socialist consciousness;

　　(3) The erroneous work style of some cadres, characterized by detachment from the masses and detachment from reality, is rapidly changing;

　　(4) The improvement of enterprise management has achieved significant results;

　　(5) The working masses have re-organized, improved, and consolidated labor discipline, and a new enthusiasm for labor has emerged;

　　(6) The working masses and cadres have improved their mutual relations and formed a new unity on the new basis of criticism, self-criticism, and improved work.

　　The Central Committee believes that the leadership of factories, mines, transportation and other enterprises throughout the country should absorb the above experience, and after appropriate preparations, boldly mobilize the working masses to offer opinions and sincerely listen to the criticism of the masses. The leading organs must study each and every opinion of the masses regarding their own enterprise, implement the Central Committee's proposed principle of rectifying and correcting simultaneously, and correct immediately whatever can be corrected immediately.

　　After a certain period of "blooming and contending" and rectifying and correcting simultaneously, all enterprises should, in conjunction with some of the issues raised by the workers in big-character posters and group meetings, organize discussions on the following main topics:

　　(1) Comparison between the old and new societies, comparison of the status and lives of the working class in the old and new societies, and the question of how the working class can fulfill its leading responsibility among all the people;

　　(2) The relationship between the individual and the collective, the individual and the state;

　　(3) The relationship between improving living standards and developing production;

　　(4) The relationship between freedom and discipline, democracy and centralism;

　　(5) The relationship between the working class and the peasantry.

　　In addition to these general issues, enterprises may also raise other issues for discussion based on the specific circumstances of their locality and enterprise. Enterprise technicians and staff should participate in the discussion of the above issues. In addition, they should also debate whether the Party can lead enterprises, whether it can lead science and technology, whether intellectuals should integrate with workers and peasants, and whether technological development can disregard politics, etc. In joint state-private enterprises, issues such as whether private ownership or joint ownership is better can also be discussed.

　　During the discussion, the Party's leading organs must pay attention to guiding the masses to further recognize that socialism and capitalism are two fundamentally different paths; to recognize the leading role of the working class in socialist transformation and socialist construction; to recognize the conspiracy of bourgeois rightists to usurp state leadership and restore feudalism and capitalism; to recognize that building socialism is the fundamental interest of the working class and the people of the whole country, and that increasing production and practicing economy is the basic method of building socialism; to recognize that building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily are the fundamental policies for building our country into a great socialist industrial power and gradually improving the people's living standards; to recognize that the working class must establish and consolidate a conscious and strict socialist labor discipline, carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, and constantly struggle against all loafers, idlers, and various phenomena that disrupt labor discipline.

　　The masses should be allowed to distinguish which views and opinions are correct and which are wrong in the discussion. Ideological problems within the masses, and the distinction between right and wrong, can only be persuaded, not suppressed.

　　During the rectification period, all enterprises should maintain normal production order and ensure that both rectification and production are not neglected.

　　In addition to the matters that have been dealt with through simultaneous rectification and correction, the enterprise leading organs must continue to conduct systematic research on the various opinions raised by the masses in several debates that have not yet been dealt with, in order to further and comprehensively improve future work. Problems that cannot be solved within the scope of the enterprise's authority should be reported to the higher-level organs for consideration and handling. For all misunderstandings, or demands that are too high to be realized, patient explanations must be given. In short, problems should be solved realistically, shortcomings should be actively overcome, and a new atmosphere of unity should be created in order to run socialist enterprises well and thereby promote a new upsurge in production and construction.

　　中共中央关于在企业中进行整风和社会主义教育运动的指示
　　（一九五七年九月十二日）
    用大字报、辩论会、批评和自我批评的方式，进行整风和社会主义教育运动，业已在若干城市的企业中创造了不少模范的事例。这些事例证明了以下各点：
    （1）党的一贯信任群众多数的政策完全正确；
    （2）工人群众提问题，提意见，摆事实，讲道理，迅速地提高了自己的社会主义觉悟；
    （3）有些干部的脱离群众、脱离实际的错误作风正在迅速地改变；
    （4）企业管理工作的改进，收到显著的成效；
    （5）工人群众重新整顿、提高和巩固了劳动纪律，出现了新的劳动热情；
    （6）工人群众和干部在批评、自我批评和改进工作的新基础上，改善了相互间的关系，形成了新的团结。
    中央认为：全国各地工厂、矿山、交通等企业的领导方面，都应该吸收上述经验，在经过适当的准备之后，放手发动工人群众提意见，诚恳地倾听群众的批评。对于群众有关本企业的各种意见，领导机关都必须件件研究，贯彻执行中央提出的边整边改的方针，凡是能够立即改正的，应该立即改正。
    各企业在经过群众“大鸣大放”和边整边改的一定段落之后，应该结合工人们在大字报和小组会上所提的一些问题，就下列几个主要题目，组织讨论：
    （1）新旧社会的比较，工人阶级在新旧社会中的地位和生活的比较，工人阶级怎样在全体人民中尽到领导责任的问题；
    （2）个人和集体、个人和国家的关系；
    （3）改善生活和发展生产的关系；
    （4）自由和纪律、民主和集中的关系；
    （5）工人阶级和农民的关系。
    除了这些一般性的问题以外，各企业还可以根据本地方本企业的具体情况，提出其他问题，以供讨论。企业的技术人员和职员应该参加上述问题的讨论，此外，他们还应该辩论党能否领导企业，能否领导科学技术，知识分子是否应该同工农群众结合，发展技术是否可以不问政治等等问题。在公私合营企业中，还可以讨论是私营好还是合营好这一类的问题。
    在讨论中，党的领导机关必须注意引导群众进一步地认识社会主义和资本主义是两条根本不同的道路；认识工人阶级在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的领导作用；认识资产阶级右派企图篡夺国家领导权、恢复封建制度和资本主义制度的阴谋；认识建设社会主义是工人阶级和全国人民的根本利益，而增产节约是建设社会主义的基本方法；认识勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和勤俭持家是把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义工业国和逐步提高人民生活水平的根本方针；认识工人阶级必须建立和巩固自觉的、严格的社会主义劳动纪律，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，经常同一切二流子、懒汉和各种破坏劳动纪律的现象作斗争。
    要让群众在讨论中，辨别出那些观点和意见是正确的，那些观点和意见是错误的。群众内部的思想问题，是非的辨别问题，只能说服，不能压服。
    在整风期间，一切企业都应该保持正常的生产秩序，做到整风和生产两不误。
    除了边整边改、业已处理的事项以外，企业领导机关必须继续对于群众在几次辩论中提出而还未加处理的各种意见，进行有系统的研究，以便进一步地全面地改进今后的工作。在本企业职权范围内不能解决的问题，应该报请上级机关考虑处理。凡是出于误解，或者要求过高而不可能实现的，都必须进行耐心的解释。总之，要实事求是地解决问题，积极克服缺点，造成团结的新气象，以便办好社会主义企业，并从而促进生产和建设的新高潮。
