Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 25th: The "Liberation" weekly reported on September 24th that the number of American "experts" in those Middle Eastern countries that have accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is estimated at 4,000.

The magazine said that some are "military experts," and others are "experts" responsible for providing technical assistance to Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon. Of the 4,000, 1,000 have been dispatched recently. There are now about 700 American "experts" each in Jordan and Iraq, most of whom are training the Iraqi and Jordanian armies in the use of American weapons.

"Liberation" weekly said that in addition to the 4,000 mentioned, there are also a large number of American "military experts" in Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco.

It pointed out that countries with these American "experts" and military bases have experienced inflation and huge deficits in their budgets. This is due to the need to maintain military bases, the demand for armaments, and the one-sided engagement in unproductive projects by these American "experts." The purpose of these "experts" in doing so is to make these countries continue to rely on American aid and cede sovereignty to U.S. imperialism.

The weekly said that these American "experts" also help reactionary institutions to eliminate national struggles.

    美国“专家”在中东无孔不入  接受“美援”的国家得不偿失
    新华社开罗25日电　“解放”周刊9月24日报道，在接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”的那些中东国家中，美国“专家”估计达四千人。
    这家杂志说，他们有的是“军事专家”，有的是负责给土耳其、伊拉克、约旦和黎巴嫩的技术援助的“专家”。在四千人中，有一千人是最近派遣去的。现在在约旦和伊拉克的美国“专家”各为七百人左右，其中大多数是在训练伊拉克和约旦的军队使用美国武器。
    “解放”周刊说，除提到的四千人以外，在利比亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥还有大批美国“军事专家”。
    它指出，这些有美国“专家”和军事基地的国家都发生了通货膨胀和预算中的巨额亏空。这是由于要维持军事基地、军备的需求，以及这些美国“专家”片面地从事非生产性的工程所造成的。这些“专家”这样做的目的，是要使这些国家继续依靠美国援助，把主权让给美帝国主义。
    这家周刊说，这些美国“专家”还帮助反动机构来消灭民族斗争。
