    At the Beijing Welcome Rally
    Radhakrishnan's Speech
    Friends:
    I am deeply moved by the warm welcome I have received in your country and at this grand gathering. Before I personally arrived in Beijing, this city was a mythical city to me. It is an ancient and modern city, known for its historical sites and modern achievements. I have seen your lovely lakes, your beautiful forests, your artistic buildings. In particular, I have seen your people, young and old, all full of enthusiasm, sincerity, friendship, and a fervent desire to build a happy new China and a happy new world. No country is greater than the people who make it up. I see here a disciplined, enthusiastic, and dedicated nation. The crowds I saw at the airport and this morning at Peking University, their exemplary behavior, their enthusiastic yet orderly demeanor, all of this has deeply impressed me.
    Because your enthusiasm is disciplined, I believe your progress will be rapid and orderly.
    India is not a strange country to you. Our thoughts and cultures are not entirely different. Just at noon today, while having lunch in your Summer Palace, I saw lines written by a 12th-century poet. The poem reads: People of old came from the land of Tianzhu, with drifting clouds accompanying their flying staffs. They fell from mid-air and did not congeal, transforming into strange peaks soaring into the azure sky... The Daoist sits in meditation without end, his chest as bright as ice and snow. Deep in the night, he emerges from meditation to draw pure coolness, a piece of cold spring reflecting the western cliff moon. The three great teachers who shaped Chinese history and culture—Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Buddha—proclaimed the same principles of wisdom and compassion: we should not work for our own selfish interests, but for the happiness of the people. We should selflessly and wholeheartedly serve society. Compassion for suffering humanity is the central idea of the teachings of these three great teachers who shaped your thought and life.
    As long as your country can rely on the selfless dedication of its farmers, workers, intellectuals, and the various social strata that make up the entire Chinese people, your future is guaranteed.
    Sir, you just mentioned some of the problems we face. Today, the most prominent feature is the revival of Asia and Africa. The people of these regions, who have been enslaved for a long time, are now gaining freedom. They are demanding their rights as citizens of the world, not as the slaves they were until recently.
    In the past few years, many countries in Asia and Africa have been liberated. There are still some countries fighting for freedom. However, it is inevitable that they will eventually break free from slavery and gain liberation. The sooner this cause is completed, the better it will be for all mankind.
    The development of nuclear power is one of the prominent features of our time. This power can be used to benefit mankind, or it can be used to harm mankind. If we use this energy properly, we can have an abundant economy. If we use it improperly, we will harm ourselves, perhaps even destroy ourselves. This is the choice before our generation of humanity.
    As to whether this power will be used for good or for bad, it does not depend on the stars in the sky, but on the people on earth who control the destiny of nations. It depends on political leaders, on whether they have enough wisdom to master this new weapon for the benefit of mankind. The distances of the world are getting smaller and smaller, but our minds must become broader and broader. The world's advanced countries that now control nuclear weapons are striving to influence people's minds and preparing for war, which shows the depravity of people's minds and the corruption of their hearts. Unless something happens to renew mankind, change our entire outlook, and make us believe in the words that the world's prophets have always proclaimed to us: we are all brothers. Whoever harms one country harms all countries. Today, the world is moving towards unity. If this unity is to produce fruitful world friendship, it is necessary to abolish these nuclear weapons and stop these nuclear weapons tests. It is not the small countries in the world that bring harm to mankind. We must recognize that the greatness of a person, the greatness of a country, lies not in physical strength or material wealth, but in humanity, kindness, which you call benevolence. Benevolence does not belong to any country that controls the world or interferes in the affairs of others, no matter how large it may be; benevolence belongs to every country that helps other countries develop and strives for the unity of the whole world. There are no divinely appointed humanistic educators in the world.
    The terror of nuclear war facing humanity today is unbelievable, so we must generate a sense of humanity, we must completely change our minds and hearts, and try to embark on the path of humility and integrity. This is the imminent danger and the problem before us.
    Sir, you talked about the issue of peaceful coexistence. It is more difficult to do than to say. That is to say, as long as we deal with problems patiently. As long as we can gain the understanding of the people of other countries and understand their viewpoints, there is no problem in the world that cannot be solved. Peaceful coexistence means that as long as we use peaceful methods such as persuasion, discussion, mediation, and consultation, there is no problem that cannot be reconciled. It is not enough to be loyal to peaceful coexistence in theory alone, unless we illustrate it in practice.
    You are familiar with the word "Dao." It is the cohesive force that unites and brings people together. Its opposite is "lack of Dao." It tears people apart, disintegrates society, and creates new problems. Therefore, we must recognize through this cohesive force, this unifying force, that all people are the same inside, they have the same feelings and the same psychological state. If handled properly, this world can become a happy family for mankind, and not an insane asylum.
    As long as we abide by moral principles, as long as we consider problems not entirely from a material perspective, as long as we do this, I have no doubt that our future is guaranteed. If we abandon spiritual values and moral principles for the sake of material survival, our future will indeed be bleak.
    On behalf of my government and people, I assure you that we abide by the principles you have put forward here in China: "Sino-Indian friendship" and "world peace." I can also say with certainty that the way to achieve this is to act according to morality. The great teacher once said: Raise the banner of justice, blow the conch of justice, beat the drum of justice, and act according to reason, and you will prosper. Thank you.

### 在北京各界欢迎大会上  拉达克里希南的讲话

    在北京各界欢迎大会上
    拉达克里希南的讲话朋友们：
    我在贵国和这个盛大集会上所受到的热情欢迎，使我深为感动。在我亲身到达北京以前，这座城市对我来说一直是一座神话似的城市。它是一座又古老又现代化的城市，以名胜古迹和现代的成就而著称。我看到了你们可爱的湖泊，你们美丽的森林，你们富有艺术风味的建筑。尤其是，我看到了你们的人民，不论老幼，全都充满着热情，满怀着热诚，满怀着友情，满怀着建设幸福的新中国和幸福的新世界的热烈愿望。没有一个国家会比构成这个国家的人民更伟大。我在这里看到一个有纪律、热情和充满献身精神的民族。我在飞机场上和今天早晨在北京大学所看到的群众，他们的值得人们效法的举止，他们既热情而又秩序井然的表现，所有这些都给了我很深的印象。
    由于你们的热情是有纪律的，我相信你们的进步也会是迅速而有秩序的。
    印度对你们并不是一个陌生的国家。我们同你们的思想和文化并不是完全相异的。就在今天中午，我在你们的颐和园里用午餐的时候，看到了十二世纪一位诗人所写的诗句。这首诗写道：昔人来自天竺国，漂渺流云伴飞锡，天半吹落凝不去，化作奇峰耸空碧……道人宴坐无止息，炯若层胸照冰雪，夜深出定汲清冷，寒泉一片西岩月。铸造了中国的历史和文化的三位伟大的导师老子、孔子和释迦牟尼昭示了同样的富于智慧和同情精神的原则，那就是：我们不应该为一已的私利工作，而应该为人民的幸福工作。我们应该忘我地、全心全意地为社会服务。对于遭受苦难的人类的怜悯是铸造你们的思想和生活的这三位伟大导师的教诲的中心思想。
    只要你们的国家能够依靠它的农民、工人、知识分子和构成整个中国人民的各个不同的社会阶层的无私的献身精神，你们的前途是可以保证的。
    先生，你刚才想到一些我们所面临的问题，今天有一个最突出的特点，那就是亚洲和非洲的复兴。长久以来一直被奴役的这些地区的人民现在正获得自由。他们正在以世界公民的身份而不是以他们不久以前还具有的奴隶身份来要求他们的权利。
    在过去几年中，亚洲和非洲的很多国家已经得到解放。仍然有一些国家在为自由而奋斗。但是，他们最后摆脱奴役获得解放是不可避免的，这种事业完成得越早，对全人类也越有好处。
    原子核动力的发展是我们时代突出的特点之一。这种动力可以用来造福人类，它也可以用来祸害人类。如果我们适当地使用这种能量，我们就能拥有富足的经济。如果我们使用不当，我们就会伤害我们自己，也许还会毁灭我们自己。这就是摆在我们这一代人类面前的抉择。
    至于这种动力究竟是用于好的方面还是用于坏的方面，这不取决于天上的命星，而取决于地上的掌握着国家命运的人。这取决于政治领袖们，取决于他们是否有足够的智慧来掌握这种新武器为人类谋福利。世界的距离是愈来愈缩小，我们的胸襟却必须越来越宽广。现在控制着核武器的世界先进国家竟然在竭力影响人们的思想，为战争作准备，这说明人们的思想堕落、心灵腐化，除非发生一些事情，使人类面目一新，改变我们的整个观点，使我们相信世界上的先知们一向昭示我们的话：我们都是兄弟。谁要是损害一个国家，谁就是损害一切国家。今天，世界正趋于团结一致，如果要这种团结产生富有成果的世界友谊，那就有必要废除这些核武器和停止这些核武器试验。给人类带来危害的并不是世界上的弱小国家。我们必须认识到，一个人的伟大，一个国家的伟大，并不在于体力或者物质财富，而是在于人道，和善，也就是你们所说的仁。仁不属于任何控制世界或干涉他人事务的国家，不管它有多大；仁是属于每个帮助别国发展并为全世界的团结而努力的国家的。世上并没有什么上天指派的人道的教化者。
    今天人类所面临的原子核战争的恐怖是令人难于置信的，因此我们必须产生一种人道观念，我们必须彻底改变自己的思想和心意，设法走上谦逊和正直的道路。这就是目前迫在眉睫的危险摆在我们面前的问题。
    先生，你谈到和平共处问题。关于这个问题做比说要难。这就是说，只要耐心地处理问题。只要能得到其他国家人民的了解，只要能了解他们的观点，世界上没有一个问题是不可以解决的。和平共处的意思就是：只要用说服、讨论、调解和协商等和平方法，没有一个问题是不可以取得和解的。除非我们在实践中加以说明，仅仅在理论上忠于和平共处是不够的。
    你们是熟悉“道”这个字的。它就是把人们联合和团结在一起的凝聚力。它的反面就是“无道”。它使人们分崩离析，它使社会陷于瓦解，并且造成新的问题。因此，我们就必须通过这种凝聚力，这种团结的力量来认识：所有的人内心都是一样的，他们有相同的感情和相同的心理状态。如果处理得当这个世界就可以成为一个人类的幸福家庭，而不致成为一个疯人院。
    只要我们遵守道义原则，只要我们考虑问题时并不完全着眼于物质方面，只要我们这样做，我毫不怀疑我们的前途是有保障的。如果我们为了物质上的生存而放弃精神价值和道义原则，我们的前途就的确是暗淡的。
    我代表我国政府和人民向你们保证、我们遵守你们在这里、在中国提出的原则。那就是：“中印友谊”和“世界和平”。我还可以肯定地对你们说，实现这一点的方法就是根据道德行事。伟大的导师曾经说过：举起正义的旗帜，吹起正义的海螺，打起正义的鼓，依理行事，你们就能繁荣昌盛。谢谢你们。
