Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: More than twenty professors from Peking University have suggested that the school leadership mobilize and organize all teachers in the university to undertake the task of socialist ideological education.

This suggestion was put forward by the professors at a symposium held by the school on the 10th and 11th.

The professors believe that socialist ideological education for students should not only be carried out through political classes, but also through every professional course, especially courses in social sciences and literature. Because these courses all have a strong class character, a clear banner of Marxism-Leninism should be established in the lectures. They criticized the tendency towards objectivism in teaching in the previous period.

The professors suggested that in the most recent period, courses in social sciences, literature and other departments should be combined with the criticism of the reactionary remarks of right-wing elements and some confused ideas among students for teaching, in order to help students establish the working class's point of view in various professional courses.

The professors who attended the symposium unanimously agreed that in order to undertake this task, professors must first strengthen their socialist self-education and strive to transform their thinking.

　　教师都应担负思想教育任务
    北大二十多位教授提出建议
    据新华社13日讯  北京大学二十多位教授建议学校领导上动员和组织全校所有教师都担负起社会主义思想教育的任务。
    这个建议是教授们在10日和11日学校召开的座谈会上提出的。
    教授们认为，对学生进行社会主义思想教育，不仅应该通过政治课，同时应该通过每门专业课，特别是社会科学和文学的课程。因为这些课程都具有强烈的阶级性，应该在讲授中树立起鲜明的马克思列宁主义的旗帜。他们对前一时期教学中的客观主义倾向提出了批评。
    教授们建议在最近一个时期内，社会科学、文学等科系的课程应该结合批判右派分子的反动言论，以及学生中的一些糊涂思想来进行教学，以便帮助学生在各项专业课程中树立起工人阶级的观点。
    参加座谈会的教授们一致认为，要担负起这一任务，教授们也必须首先加强社会主义自我教育，努力改造思想。
