Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd dispatch: According to TASS, the Soviet Academy of Sciences expedition team is stepping up preparations for the third stage of its "offensive" on Antarctica. In September, a new scientific team will head to Antarctica for a rotation, to further unveil the secrets of this remote and harsh continent.

    Burkhanov, a member of the Executive Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Antarctic Expedition Committee, told TASS reporters that now, before the expedition team fully unfolds its work, the main task is to equip the team with the most complete technical and scientific equipment necessary for establishing the planned inland stations. We believe that the most important thing is to arrange uninterrupted snowmobile tractor train traffic, which can be used as a tool for transporting goods and as a mobile laboratory.

    The scientist also said that due to the extreme cold, the snow in Antarctica is granular and as dry as sand in the desert, and ordinary tractors will lose half their horsepower and become unsuitable at the altitude of three to four thousand meters where the inland stations are located. However, more than 3,000 tons of cargo must be transported to the inland stations in Antarctica this year, so the technical transformation of snowmobile trains is of great significance. He said that the Soviet Union is now manufacturing "Si-100A" type Antarctic-specific tractors, all of which are equipped with blowers for pressurization, which can eliminate the phenomenon of reduced horsepower due to low air pressure when walking on high ground. Some of these tractors are equipped with tracks up to one meter wide. Aircraft are being fitted with special auxiliary devices for takeoff under difficult Antarctic conditions.

    Burkhanov said that the new Antarctic scientific station "Soviet" station will be located on an ice plateau at an altitude of about four to four and a half thousand meters. According to scientists, the temperature there reaches minus 85 to 90 degrees Celsius in winter. The staff at this station will use oxygen equipment to compensate for the lack of oxygen on the plateau. The working conditions there are extremely difficult, and organizing fixed scientific research under such conditions is a first in history.

    进一步揭开严寒大陆的秘密
    苏联准备三探南极
    新华社2日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院考察队正在加紧准备对南极的第三阶段的“进攻”。在9月内，新的科学队伍就要开往南极换班，以进一步揭开这个辽远和严寒的大洲的秘密。
    苏联科学院南极考察委员会执行委员会委员布尔哈诺夫对塔斯社记者说，现在，在考察队即将全面展开工作以前，主要任务在于使考察队得到为建立预定的内陆站所必需的最完善的技术和科学设备。我们认为最重要的是安排不间断的雪撬拖拉机列车交通，这种列车可以成为运送货物的工具，同时可以用作流动实验室。
    这位科学家还说，由于天气酷寒，南极的雪结成颗粒状态，干燥得像沙漠上的沙子一样，而且内陆站所处的海拔三千到四千公尺高度的高地上，一般的拖拉机将因此失去一半马力而不大适用。然而，今年必须向南极内陆站运入三千多吨货物，因此雪撬列车的技术改造具有很大意义。他说，现在，苏联正在制造一种“斯—一百A”型南极专用拖拉机，这些拖拉机都装有鼓风用的压气机，这样就可以消除在高地上行走时因气压过低而减少马力的现象。其中有些拖拉机装有宽达一公尺的履带。飞机正在安装在南极困难条件下起飞的特殊辅助装置。
    布尔哈诺夫说，新的南极科学站“苏维埃”站将设在海拔约四千到四千五百公尺的积冰高原上。据科学家意见，那里的气温在冬季达到零下八十五到九十度。这个站上的工作人员将使用氧气装置来弥补高原上氧气的不足。那里工作的条件是极困难的，在这种条件下组织固定的科学研究在历史上还是第一次。
