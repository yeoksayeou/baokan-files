Southern Song Dynasty Bronze Seal

The West Lake Dredging Project recently unearthed two Southern Song Dynasty cultural relics during dredging operations. One is a bronze seal cast in the second month of the fourth year of Jianyan (1130 AD). The seal is square. On the back of the seal, the right side is engraved with "Second Month, Fourth Year of Jianyan, × Day," and the left side is engraved with "Cast by the Xuanfu Chuzhi Shi Si Xingfu" (roughly translated as "Military Commissioner's Office Field Headquarters"). Jianyan was the reign title of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty, Zhao Gou, and is now eight hundred and twenty-seven years ago. The bronze seal has twelve characters in seal script in relief reading "Xuanfu Chuzhi Shi Si Suijun Shenbu Si Yin" (Seal of the Military Commissioner's Office's Military Justice Department). The other item is a bronze "Qian Pai" (money tally), rectangular in shape, with a round hole at the top. The "Qian Pai" was cast during the Southern Song Dynasty. The face of the "Qian Pai" has five characters reading "Lin'an Fu Xingyong" (for use in Lin'an Prefecture), and the back has five characters reading "Zhun Wu Bai Wen Sheng" (equivalent to 500 cash). This money tally is a valuable material for studying the history of Chinese currency.

　　南宋铜印
    西湖浚湖工程处最近在挖泥工程中挖出南宋文物二件。一件是建炎四年二月铸的铜印，印系正方形，印背上右边刻有“建炎四年二月×日”，左边刻有“宣抚处置使司行府铸”等文字。建炎为宋高宗赵构年号，离现在已有八百二十七年；铜印有篆刻阳文“宣抚处置使司随军审部司印”十二个字。另一件为铜质的“钱牌”，长方形，顶上有一圆孔，“钱牌”是南宋时铸的，“钱牌”牌面有“临安府行用”五个字，背面有“准伍佰文省”五个字。这个钱牌是一件研究我国货币史的珍贵材料。
