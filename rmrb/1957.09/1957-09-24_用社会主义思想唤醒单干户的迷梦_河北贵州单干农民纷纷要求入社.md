    Using Socialist Thought to Awaken Individual Farmers from Their Dreams
    Individual Farmers in Hebei and Guizhou Request to Join Cooperatives

    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 23rd: During the socialist propaganda and education campaign in the rural areas of Hebei Province, many individual farmers were educated and saw with their own eyes that the crops of cooperatives grew better and yielded more than those of individual farmers. They realized that taking the socialist road was good and glorious, and they requested to join cooperatives. According to statistics from eleven counties, more than 1,600 households have recently submitted requests to join cooperatives, of which more than 550 have been approved and have already joined. According to statistics from another seventeen counties, more than 110 of the more than 250 households that had withdrawn from cooperatives have also returned to the cooperatives.
    In carrying out this campaign, the rural areas of Hebei Province generally paid attention to strengthening education for individual farmers and cooperative members who had withdrawn. Many townships and cooperatives paid attention to including individual farmers in report meetings and group discussion meetings to help them criticize capitalist ideas and carry out socialist education.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 23rd: More than 1,000 individual farming households in Meitan County, Guizhou Province, have recently been educated on the two roads, their awareness has been raised, and they have applied to join agricultural cooperatives after the autumn harvest. So far, more than 800 individual farming households have submitted such applications.
    When展开各个农业社展开 large-scale socialist debates, they all actively invited individual farmers to participate. Members conducted socialist ideological education through reminiscence comparisons and accounting, using practical examples to distinguish between right and wrong, so that individual households were also subjected to socialist education.

    用社会主义思想唤醒单干户的迷梦
    河北贵州单干农民纷纷要求入社
    新华社保定23日电　河北省农村在开展社会主义宣传教育运动期间，不少单干农民受到教育，并且亲眼看到合作社比单干户庄稼长的好、收的多，认识到走社会主义道路又好又光荣，纷纷要求加入合作社。据十一个县统计，最近有一千六百多户提出入社要求，其中五百五十多户得到批准已经入了社。另据十七个县统计，原有二百五十多户已经退社的社员，也有一百一十多户重新回到了社。
    河北省的农村在开展这一运动时，一般都注意加强对单干农民和退社社员进行教育。许多乡、社在召开报告会、小组辩论会时，都注意吸收单干农民参加，帮助他们批判资本主义思想，进行社会主义教育。
    新华社贵阳23日电　贵州省湄潭县的一千多户单干农民，最近受到两条道路的教育，觉悟提高，纷纷提出申请，要求在秋收后参加农业社。到目前止，提出这种申请的单干农户已有八百多户。
    各个农业社在展开社会主义大辩论时，都主动地吸收单干户参加辩论会。社员们通过回忆对比和算账，以实际事例进行社会主义思想教育，分清大是大非，使单干户也受到了社会主义教育。
