Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 8th - The anti-Rightist struggle in Qinghai Province and in the agencies, enterprises, and institutions of Xining City is currently developing in a more in-depth and meticulous direction. As the struggle gradually deepens, right-leaning sentiments are gradually being overcome, and the units involved in this struggle have expanded from a few industries to all walks of life. The number of people participating in the anti-Rightist struggle has reached more than 14,000.

In the struggle against the Rightists, various units have adopted the method of reasoning to expose the more hidden Rightists one by one, and have analyzed and criticized the Rightists' reactionary statements item by item, making the Rightists completely isolated. For example, when the Qinghai Daily began the anti-Rightist struggle, only five Rightists with relatively blatant reactionary words and deeds were exposed, and some Rightists even pretended to be good people. As the struggle deepened step by step, ten more Rightists were exposed. For example, Rightists such as Sun Mingxuan, Lei Tingzi, and Yan Yumin pretended to be active after the anti-Rightist struggle began, posing as leftists, and pretending to "struggle" against Rightists such as Cheng Yuan and Guo Tonghou. In the struggle, they were ostensibly stern, but the actual content was empty and meaningless. Behind their backs, these two groups of Rightists made a pact of mutual defense, not exposing each other. When the masses sharpened their eyes, their tricks were quickly exposed. The struggle of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles against the Han Qiufu reactionary group was also similarly from shallow to deep. Starting from criticizing Han's articles such as "Good people cannot be produced under the whip," the group's program and plan to usurp the leadership of the Communist Party's literary journal "Qinghai Lake" was gradually exposed. Later, in further pursuit, Wang Jiao (female), who claimed to have twenty years of counter-revolutionary experience, the mastermind behind this reactionary group, was exposed.

In order to defeat the Rightists politically and ideologically, the Qinghai Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has formulated fifteen topics for the Rightists' remarks—for whom does literature and art serve, how does literature and art intervene in life, the relationship between literature and art and politics, etc.—and is preparing to conduct systematic criticism from a theoretical perspective. Other units that started the anti-Rightist struggle earlier are also doing the same.

### 对右派言论一条条分析批判  青海斗争深入右派集团幕后人被揭露出来

    对右派言论一条条分析批判
    青海斗争深入右派集团幕后人被揭露出来
    新华社西宁8日电　青海省和西宁市机关、企业、事业单位中的反右派斗争目前正朝着更加深入和细致的方向发展。随着斗争的逐步深入，右倾情绪逐渐被克服，卷入这一斗争的单位已由几个行业发展到各行各业，参加反右派斗争的人数也达到了一万四千多人。
    各单位在同右派分子进行斗争中，采取说理的方法把较隐蔽的右派分子一个个揭露出来，又针对右派分子的反动言论，一条条一件件地进行分析批判，使右派分子陷于完全孤立。例如，青海日报社在开始进行反右派斗争时，只揭露出五个反动言行比较露骨的右派分子，有一些右派分子还冒充好人。随着斗争的步步深入，又有十个右派分子被揭露出来。如孙明轩、雷庭梓、阎育民等右派分子，他们在反右派斗争开始后还假装积极，冒充左派，装腔作势地向程远、郭统厚等右派分子进行“斗争”。他们在斗争中表面上声色俱厉，但实际内容空洞无物，而背地里这两伙右派分子却订立攻守同盟，互不揭露。当群众擦亮了眼睛以后，他们的伎俩便很快地被揭露出来。省文联对韩秋夫反动集团的斗争也同样是由浅入深。从批判韩的“皮鞭底下打不出好人来”等文章入手，逐步揭露出这个集团企图篡夺共产党领导的文艺刊物“青海湖”的纲领和计划，以后在进一步追击中，又把这个反动集团的幕后操纵人——自称有二十年反革命经验的王皎（女）揭露出来。
    为了在政治上和思想上击败右派分子，青海省文联对右派分子的言论已拟定了十五个专题——文艺为谁服务、文艺怎样干预生活、文艺与政治的关系等，准备从理论上进行系统的批判。其他反右派斗争开展得比较早的单位也正在这样做。
