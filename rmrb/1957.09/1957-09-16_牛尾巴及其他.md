　　The story goes like this:

　　One day, a landlord element murdered a cooperative's draught cattle. In haste, he only managed to chop off the cow's tail before being discovered by the cooperative members. The cooperative members, leading the tailless cow, dragged this lawless landlord element to the court, accusing him by saying: "This lawless landlord element is sabotaging production..." The court accepted the case.

　　The "judges," as usual, inquired about the names, ages, places of origin, etc., of the plaintiff and defendant. After "verifying" the "identity" of the tailless cow and going through some "research," one of the "judges" gave a very colloquial explanation to the plaintiff: "A cow can still plow the fields without a tail. Chopping off the cow's tail cannot be considered 'sabotaging production'..." The "judge" pointed to the lawless landlord element standing aside and said: "Therefore, this defendant has not committed a crime."

　　The "judge's" words relieved the defendant but filled the plaintiff with anger. After repeated appeals proved futile, one of the cooperative members pointed to the "judge" who had just delivered the verdict and asked: "Can a person eat without ears?" The "judge" replied: "Yes." The cooperative member walked up to the "judge," and although very angry, still said politely, "Excuse me, 'Judge Comrade,' if someone cuts off your ears, would that be considered 'committing a crime'?" The "judge" smiled bitterly and said to the plaintiff and defendant in a very calm tone: "Okay, comrades, you can all go back now. Anyway, these things are considered contradictions among the people and should be resolved slowly using gentle and persuasive methods."

　　The story doesn't end here. Originally, this story took place in Sichuan, which borders Hubei. Thus, it spread to Hubei. At a cadre meeting of the Hubei Provincial Political and Legal Department, someone mentioned this story of the cow's tail. Strangely enough, an old fellow said in all seriousness: "My view is the same. The person who chopped off the cow's tail cannot be considered 'sabotaging production.'" Look, the "judge" in Sichuan has a "comrade" in Hubei. Perhaps this is what is called "great minds think alike"!

　　The story of the cow's tail comes to an end. Unfortunately, it is still unknown whether the ears of the Sichuan "judge" and his "comrade" in Hubei have been cut off as the cooperative member described. God bless, may this unfortunate event not occur. However, even if it does, it doesn't matter. According to the Sichuan "judge's" own "verdict," it would at most be a "contradiction among the people," which can be "resolved slowly using gentle and persuasive methods."

　　However, the question is not whether the "judge's" own ears are safe. The question is what serious consequences will result if we regard enemy-people contradictions like the landlord element's murder of the cooperative's draught cattle as contradictions among the people. Is it a cow's tail being chopped off, a "judge's" ears being cut off, or the heads of thousands upon thousands of people falling to the ground?!

　　From the story of the cow's tail above, we can see why the "learned" "judges," after studying and studying, cannot figure out the nature of the incident of the lawless landlord element assassinating the cooperative's draught cattle, while the uneducated peasants grasp the nature of the incident with piercing insight. It seems there is a "lesson" here, and that is the issue of standpoint. In this simple "cow's tail story," we understand this point.

　　牛尾巴及其他
　　一丁
    故事是这样发生的：
    有一天，一个地主分子谋杀合作社的一头耕牛，仓卒之间，只斩下了这头耕牛的尾巴，就被社员们发觉了。社员们牵着这头没有尾巴的牛，将这个不法地主分子扭送到法院，向法院控诉说：“这个不法的地主分子破坏生产……。”法院受理了这个案件。
    “法官”们照例地讯问了原告、被告的姓名、年龄、籍贯等等之后，“验明”了这个没有尾巴的牛的“正身”，又经过一番“研究”，然后，由一位“法官”向原告做了非常通俗的解释：“牛没有尾巴，仍然可以耕田，斩下了牛的尾巴，并不能算是‘破坏生产’……”这位“法官”指着那个站在一旁的不法地主分子说：“因此，这位被告并没有犯法。”
    “法官”这一席话，使被告松了一口气，原告窝了一肚子火。原告经过再三申诉无效之后，一位社员指着刚才宣判的那位“法官”问：“人没有耳朵能不能吃饭？”“法官”应曰：“能”。社员走近“法官”，虽然很气愤，但是仍然很有礼貌地说：“对不起，‘法官同志’，如果有人割了你的耳朵，算不算‘犯法’？”“法官”苦笑了笑，用一种非常冷静的腔调对着原告和被告说：“好吧，同志们，你们都回去吧，反正这些事情都算是人民内部的矛盾，采取和风细雨的办法慢慢地解决吧。”
    说到这里，这个故事并没有完结。本来这个故事发生在四川，四川和湖北交界，从而传到了湖北。在湖北省政法部门的一次干部会上，有人提到了这个牛尾巴的故事。说也奇怪，居然有一位老兄一本正经地说：“我的看法也是这样，斩掉牛尾巴的人并不能算是‘破坏生产’。”瞧，四川的“法官”，在湖北有了“同志”了，也许这就是所谓“英雄所见略同”吧！
    牛尾巴的故事告一段落了。遗憾的是，直到现在还不知道那位四川的“法官”和他的在湖北的“同志”的耳朵，是否像那位社员所说的已经被人割掉了。天保佑，惟愿不发生这种不幸的事情。不过，即发生了，也不要紧，照四川的那位“法官”自己的“判决”，充其量也不过是“人民内部的矛盾”，可以“采取和风细雨的办法慢慢地解决”罢了。
    不过，问题不在于“法官”自己的耳朵是否安全，问题在于如果把地主分子谋杀合作社的耕牛这一类的敌我矛盾一概当做人民内部矛盾之后，将会造成怎样严重的恶果。是一头牛的尾巴被斩掉，是“法官”的耳朵被割掉，还是千百万人头落地？！
    从上面说的牛尾巴的故事就可以看出：为什么有“学问”的“法官”，研究来，研究去，弄不清不法地主分子暗杀合作社的耕牛这个事件的性质，而缺乏文化的农民就一针见血地抓住了这个事件的性质呢？看来这里面是有一个“学问”，那就是立场问题。在这个简单的“牛尾巴的故事”里，我们懂得了这一点。
