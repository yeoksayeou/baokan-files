Intellectuals Should Learn Lessons from the “Textbooks” Provided by the Rightists
Guo Shengwu

At the present stage, when China's socialist revolution has been basically completed and socialist construction is forging ahead by overcoming numerous difficulties, the bourgeois rightists, unwilling to accept the demise of capitalism, are resorting to desperate measures. Blinded by greed, they are so foolish as to be “blinded by a leaf and unable to see Mount Tai.” They regard the Party's proposals for “opposing dogmatism,” “letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend,” “correctly handling contradictions among the people,” and launching a “rectification movement to overcome subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism” as opportunities to be exploited. They are gathering their cohorts, stirring up trouble everywhere, and launching a wild attack. Using the trick of "calling a deer a horse" and plotting to deceive the heavens and replace the sun, they attempt to drag the wheel of history back forty years, back to the bankrupt bourgeois old democratic era before the May Fourth Movement.

The extremely absurd tricks of the bourgeois rightists prove that they lack basic historical knowledge, although most of them are self-proclaimed "great intellectuals." They prove that they fundamentally betray the morals of being Chinese, although they all put on a hypocritical appearance of "compassion for humanity." But more importantly, they prove that "it is truly difficult to change one's nature." The Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis is particularly applicable to analyzing this handful of rightists who hate class analysis. For them, it is truly "contrary to their wishes." Poisonous weeds become fertilizer, compiling an excellent "political textbook" for the people, especially intellectuals.

This political textbook is very rich in content, very vivid, and simply "inexhaustible." It cannot be learned in a year or two. Not to mention other issues, it provides many "wonderful" "chapters" on the issue of ideological remolding of intellectuals alone. Let's just take a look at a few "chapters":

One "chapter" is titled: "Marxism-Leninism only asks people to obey blindly and does not allow people to be skeptical of anything." "Studying Marxism-Leninism will hinder the independent thinking of intellectuals and limit the better development of their thoughts and understanding." This is truly a "head-on blow," trying to disarm the intellectuals ideologically all at once. Originally, intellectuals who served the old society in the past are now transitioning to serve the new society, which raises the question of how they understand the essence of the new society and how they adapt to the needs of the new society. To solve this problem, it is impossible to do without studying Marxism-Leninism, which guides the progress of our cause. Just as the majority of intellectuals, through preliminary study of Marxism-Leninism, began to have some understanding of the essence of the new society, began to adapt to the needs of the new society, and felt that their ideological state was still lagging behind their fundamentally changed political and social status, and asked the Party to help them more in their self-remolding and self-education, the rightists saw that things were not going well and quickly grabbed their hind legs, not wanting them to study Marxism-Leninism, not wanting them to recognize the essence of the new society, and not wanting them to adapt to the needs of the new society to remold themselves. They wanted them to quickly close their eyes that had begun to open and quickly abandon the truth that they had begun to believe. The ultimate goal was to have them change their fundamentally changed political and social status back again, from a political and social status of serving the new society back to a political and social status of serving the old society, to follow the rightists in engaging in the restoration of capitalism and to be enemies of the people. This is the meaning of what they call "not blindly obeying," "being skeptical," "thinking independently," and "better development of thoughts and understanding." Can these rightists' words have any other explanation besides this?

The revolutionary history of China in the past hundred years, the history of the growth of Chinese revolutionary intellectuals, is precisely a history of struggle in which Chinese intellectuals and the people of the whole country pursued the truth of saving the country and the people, gradually overcame "blind obedience" to feudalism, imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and bourgeois old democracy, and learned to "think independently" through countless bloody lessons and found Marxism-Leninism. Opposing dogmatism is also an important part of this history of struggle. Here, the rightists' conspiracy to call a deer a horse and deceive the heavens and replace the sun is an attempt to oppose Marxism-Leninism and restore capitalism under the guise of opposing dogmatism. What "opposing blind obedience" and "advocating independent thinking" cannot be interpreted according to their original meanings in the vocabulary of the rightists.

But the rightists still understand some of the weaknesses of intellectuals after all. Among intellectuals, some are ideologically empty but self-important, love to write "thorough" overturning articles, and like to throw out the baby with the bathwater; some are accustomed to being divorced from reality, considering problems abstractly, and cannot see the objective standards of truth and fallacy, moving towards skepticism and agnosticism of "this is a yes, that is a no"; especially since most intellectuals are not yet familiar with Marxism-Leninism, do not deeply understand its spiritual essence, and their positions and viewpoints are not firm and clear enough, a little bit of sweet talk can be effective for a while, so the rightists dare to use the trick of calling a deer a horse. The lesson here is that intellectuals must more consciously and actively strengthen the arming of their minds with Marxism-Leninism and must not "surrender" to the rightists.

Another "chapter" is titled: "Collectivism hinders the liberation of individuality." "Ideological remolding is spiritual torture." "Party members have Party spirit but no humanity." "The organizational discipline of activists is the outer garment of servile thinking." This kind of "heart-digging war" against intellectuals is even more vicious. Not only has it grasped some of the weaknesses of intellectuals, but it has simply grasped their "fatal" points. Because intellectuals have become accustomed to the "solitary" life of the study, and their mental labor superficially has the characteristic of "self-sufficiency," especially since they themselves are not a class, but serve a certain class through individual and seemingly "independent" activities, this often makes them particularly possess a prominent individualistic self-esteem or even lead to "megalomania." In the new society, the fundamental weakness of intellectuals is precisely their lack of organizational discipline and collectivist spirit, and the most critical and painful problem of their ideological remolding is precisely this. This constitutes the focus of the rightists' attack on them and becomes the most powerful move to pull them into the water.

The salient feature of the malicious language used by the rightists here is still the full use of the trick of calling a deer a horse and deceiving the heavens and replacing the sun. On the one hand, they deliberately confuse concepts that are similar in some phenomena but fundamentally different in essence, such as "ideological remolding" and "spiritual torture," "organizational discipline" and "servile thinking"; on the other hand, they distort mutually unified concepts into mutually opposed concepts, such as "collectivism" and "individual liberation," "Party spirit," "class nature" and "humanity." This very low-level "sleight of hand" could have been seen through as long as one had the basic cultivation of Marxism-Leninism, or even as long as one could think calmly, but because these words hit the key points of some intellectuals, they often cannot remain indifferent. The main lesson here is that when the ideological remolding of intellectuals has not entered a fully conscious and in-depth stage, when the class stand and ideological feelings of intellectuals have not undergone fundamental changes, they often "knowingly commit the crime" and "adopt liberalism towards themselves," so some obviously erroneous and unworthy "reverse words" will often have an agitational effect. The rightists are precisely using this law to put forward their tricks.

All people with some serious weaknesses should be deeply vigilant!

Yet another "chapter" is titled: "The Communist Party has too much control over the people's thoughts." "The political pressure of Marxism has made the academic atmosphere thin." "Taking Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology is contradictory to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The central meaning of this chapter is that Marxism-Leninism should not become the guiding ideology in China's social life and academic work. Two sets of methods are adopted: one is to use the methods of class struggle by the exploiting class against the exploited class, such as "ideological rule" and "political pressure," to slander the relationship between the Communist Party and the people; and in essence, it is to stubbornly resist the turned-over people and their leader, the Communist Party, from the standpoint of the exploiting class that has been or will be eliminated, because the Party and the people are precisely going to "rule" and "press" them politically and ideologically, and no matter what shield they use, whether it is "the people" or "academics" or anything else, they cannot block it. The other is to distort the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom" into something that seems to have no class nature, seems to be able to do without Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology, and seems to be able to do without political standards under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought. The purpose is to open the door for the rightists' anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

This chapter is also a poisonous arrow that cannot be underestimated for intellectuals who are accustomed to so-called "supra-class," "supra-political," "freedom of thought," and "academic freedom." Of course, political issues, ideological issues, and academic issues are different and should not be confused, but no matter whether it is a political, ideological, or academic issue, it cannot be separated from the control of a certain position, viewpoint, and way of thinking in the final analysis. Shouldn't it be very obvious that intellectuals who serve socialism, whether on political, ideological, or academic issues, should stand on the position of the working class and strive to use the viewpoint of materialism and the method of dialectics to seek correct solutions? This is the practical significance of taking Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology, and it is also the ultimate goal of the ideological remolding of intellectuals.

Intellectuals who serve the old society cannot truly be "supra-class" and "supra-political," and the so-called "freedom of thought" and "academic freedom" are just empty words. These empty words still become the capital for the rightists to attack intellectuals and pull them into the water, which can only show how deeply some intellectuals have been poisoned by the bourgeoisie and cannot explain other problems. Just as Cai Yuanpei's experience in the old society is enough to illustrate that his so-called "eclecticism" is nothing but self-deception, and similar experiences are not difficult to find among intellectuals who came from the old society, as long as everyone "seeks within themselves," the deception of the rightists will be defeated without attack.

The few chapters of textbooks that have been cited have already given our intellectuals very good lessons. The rightists are indeed "contrary to their wishes." They attempted to pull intellectuals into the water, but as a result, they gave us a lesson and explained Chairman Mao's words from the opposite side. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Although the broad masses of intellectuals have made progress, they should not be complacent because of this. In order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society and to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to remould themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian and communist world outlook. ... Do not stop halfway, and even more do not retreat backwards, there is no way out to retreat." The anti-rightist struggle further proves that these words are absolutely true.

    知识分子应该从右派提供的“教材”中吸取教训
    郭绳武
    资产阶级右派在我国社会主义革命基本完成、社会主义建设正突破重重困难飞跃前进的现阶段，不甘心资本主义的灭亡，狗急跳墙，利令智昏，居然“一叶障目，不见泰山”，把党所提出的“反对教条主义”、“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“正确处理人民内部矛盾”、开展“克服主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义的整风运动”当作了可乘之机；呼朋引类，到处点火，发动了猖狂进攻。用“指鹿为马”的手段，施偷天换日的阴谋，企图把历史的车轮拉退四十年，拉回到五四以前早已山穷水尽走头无路的资产阶级旧民主主义时代。
    资产阶级右派的这套极端荒唐的把戏，证明了他们缺乏起码的历史知识，虽然他们大多是些自命不凡的“大知识分子”；证明了他们根本上有背于中国人为人的道德，虽然他们都装出了一副“悲天悯人”的伪君子相；但更重要的是证明了“真是山河易改本性难移”。马克思列宁主义的阶级分析法，特别适用于分析仇视阶级分析法的他们这一撮子右派分子。对他们说，真是“事与愿违”，毒草变肥料，替人民群众特别是知识分子，编出了一部最好的“政治教材”。
    这部政治教材，内容十分丰富，非常生动，简直是“取之不尽，用之不竭”，一年半载学不完的。不说对别的问题，单说对知识分子思想改造这一问题，就提供了许多“精采”“章节”。随便举几“章”来看看：
    有一“章”的标题是：“马克思列宁主义只叫人盲目服从，不允许人对任何事情抱怀疑态度”。“学了马克思列宁主义就会妨碍知识分子的独立思考，就会限制他们的思想、认识更好地开展”。这真是“当头棒喝”，一下子就想要解除知识分子的思想武装。本来嘛，过去为旧社会服务的知识分子现在转到为新社会服务了，这里就存在着他们如何认识新社会的本质和如何适应新社会需要的问题。要解决这个问题，离开了学习指导我们的事业前进的马克思列宁主义是不可能的。正当多数知识分子通过对马克思列宁主义的初步学习，对新社会的本质开始有所认识，开始适应着新社会的需要，自觉地改造自己，而感到自己的思想状况还落后于已经根本改变了的政治地位和社会地位，要求党来更多地帮助他们进行自我改造与自我教育的时候，右派分子看见事情不妙，赶快扯住他们的后腿不放，不要他们去学习马克思列宁主义，不要认清新社会的本质，不要适应新社会的需要来改造自己；要他们开始睁开的眼睛赶快闭上，开始相信的真理赶快放弃；最终目的是要他们把已经根本改变了的政治、社会地位重新改变回去，从为新社会服务的政治社会地位重新改变到为旧社会服务的政治社会地位上去，跟随右派分子去干资本主义复辟的勾当，去与人民为敌。这就是他们所谓“不盲目服从”“抱怀疑态度”“独立思考”“思想、认识更好地开展”的含义，这些右派分子的语言，除此以外，难道还能有别的解释吗？
    中国近百年的革命历史，中国革命知识分子成长的历史，正是中国知识分子和全国人民一道追求救国救民的真理，逐步克服了对封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义和资产阶级旧民主主义的“盲目服从”，通过无数血的教训，学会了“独立思考”而找到了马克思列宁主义的一部斗争史；反对教条主义也正是这部斗争史的重要组成部分之一。在这里右派分子的指鹿为马偷天换日的阴谋，就是企图假借反对教条主义的名义来反对马克思列宁主义，复辟资本主义；什么“反对盲目服从”“提倡独立思考”，在右派的词汇中是不能按着它们的本义去解释的。
    但右派终归还是懂得某些知识分子的弱点的。在知识分子中，有些人思想空虚而自命不凡，爱做“透底”的翻案文章，喜欢把孩子和污水一齐倒掉；有些人习惯于脱离实际，抽象地考虑问题，看不见真理与谬论的客观标准，走向“此亦—是非，彼亦—是非”的怀疑主义与不可知论；特别是多数知识分子对马克思列宁主义还并不熟悉，精神实质体会不深，立场观点不够坚定明确，迷汤灌下一时尚能见效，所以右派敢于施展指鹿为马的手法。这里的教训就是知识分子必须更加自觉地积极地加强用马克思列宁主义来武装自己的头脑，千万不能向右派分子“缴械”。
    另一“章”的标题是：“集体主义阻碍了个性的解放”。“思想改造是精神上的折磨”。“党员有党性而无人性”。“积极分子的组织性纪律性是奴仆思想的外衣”。这种对知识分子的“挖心战”是更加毒辣了。不仅抓住了某些知识分子的弱点，简直抓到了他们“致命”的地方。由于知识分子过惯了“离众索居”的书斋生活，他们的脑力劳动表面上又有“自给自足”的特色，特别是他们本身不是一个阶级，而是通过个别的似乎“独立”的活动，为一定阶级服务的，这就使他们往往特别具有一种突出的个人主义自尊心甚至流于“自大狂”。在新社会里，知识分子的根本弱点正是他们缺乏组织性纪律性与集体主义精神，他们思想改造的最关痛痒的症结所在也正是这一点。这就构成了右派向他们进攻的焦点，成为拉他们下水的最有力的一着。
    右派这里所用的恶毒语言的显著特点，仍然是充分运用了指鹿为马偷天换日的手法。一方面对具有某些现象上的类似而本质上根本不同的概念故意加以混同，如对“思想改造”与“精神折磨”、“组织性、纪律性”与“奴仆思想”；另一方面把互相统一的概念歪曲成为互相对立的概念，如对“集体主义”与“个性解放”、“党性”、“阶级性”与“人性”。这种非常低级的“障眼法”，本来只要具有马克思列宁主义的起码修养，甚至只要能够冷静地想一想，都会识破的，但由于这些话正打中了某些知识分子的要害，所以他们往往不能无动于衷。这里的主要教训是，当知识分子思想改造还未进入充分自觉和深入阶段时，当知识分子的阶级立场、思想感情还没有根本发生变化时，往往“明知故犯”、“自己对自己采取自由主义”，因而一些显然错误不值一驳的“反话”也往往会发生煽动的作用。右派分子正是利用这一规律提出他们这套把戏来的。
    一切具有某种严重弱点的人都应该深自警惕！
    再一“章”的标题是：“共产党对人民的思想太统治了”。“马克思主义的政治压力搞得学术空气淡薄了”。“以马列主义为领导思想是和百花齐放百家争鸣矛盾的”。这一章的中心意思是说马克思列宁主义不应该成为我国社会生活中和学术工作上的领导思想。所采取的手法有两套：一套是用“思想统治”“政治压力”等剥削阶级对被剥削阶级的阶级斗争方法来诬蔑共产党和人民群众之间的关系；而实质上是站在已被消灭或将要被消灭的剥削阶级立场上对翻了身的人民及其领导者共产党进行顽抗，因为党和人民正是要从政治上、思想上来“统治”和“压”他们的，不管他们用“人民”或“学术”或任何别的挡箭牌都是挡不住的。另一套是曲解“百家争鸣百花齐放”的政策，说成似乎没有阶级性，似乎可以不要马克思列宁主义为领导思想，可以不要在马克思列宁主义思想指导下的政治标准。其目的在于给右派反党反社会主义的反党活动打开大门。
    这一章对习惯于所谓“超阶级”“超政治”“思想自由”“学术自由”的知识分子来说，也是一支不可轻视的毒箭。当然政治问题、思想问题、学术问题是有区别的，不应混为一谈，但是不管政治上、思想上或学术上的问题，归根结底不能离开一定的立场、观点和思想方法的支配。为社会主义服务的知识分子不管对政治问题，思想问题或学术问题，都应该站在工人阶级的立场上，力求运用唯物主义的观点和辩证法的方法去寻求正确的解决途径，难道不是很明显的吗？这就是以马克思列宁主义为领导思想的实际意义，也是知识分子思想改造的最终目的。
    为旧社会服务的知识分子当然不可能真正“超阶级”与“超政治”，所谓“思想自由”与“学术自由”只是一句空话而已。这句空话至今仍然成为右派向知识分子进攻，拉知识分子下水的资本，这只能说明某些知识分子思想上所受资产阶级毒害之深重而不能说明别的问题，像蔡元培在旧社会的经历固然足够说明他的所谓“兼容并包主义”只不过是自欺欺人，而类似的经验在旧社会来的知识分子中并不难于找寻，只要大家“反求诸己”，右派分子的欺骗也就不攻自破了。
    从所举的几章教材，已经给了我们知识分子很好的教训。右派分子确实“事与愿违”，他们企图拉知识分子下水，但结果却给我们上了一课，替毛主席的话从反面作了解说。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“广大的知识分子虽然已经有了进步，但是不应当因此自满。为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。……不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”在反右派斗争中进一步证明了这话是千真万确的。
