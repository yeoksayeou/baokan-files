    Chairman Zhou Enlai's Welcome Speech at the Enlarged Meeting of the CPPCC
    Respected Dr. Mohammad Hatta, friends, comrades:
  We are very honored to have Dr. Hatta attend the enlarged meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today, and we would like to extend a warm welcome to him.
    Respected Dr. Hatta, please allow me to briefly introduce the nature of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the institution of the people's democratic united front composed of all democratic parties, people's organizations, and fraternal ethnic groups in the country, and is a concrete manifestation of the unity of the Chinese people. It has played a great role in the founding and consolidation of the People's Republic of China. With the increasingly broad and consolidated people's democratic united front in our country, we will be able to better build socialism domestically, and better strengthen friendly relations with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, and work together to safeguard the cause of world peace.
    Dr. Hatta's name is no stranger to the Chinese people. We all know that Dr. Hatta is a famous Indonesian politician and economist. He devoted himself to the anti-colonial movement as early as his student days. When studying in the Netherlands, he led the Indonesian Association in anti-colonial struggle. In 1926, as Chairman of the Indonesian Association, he attended the Conference of Students from Far Eastern Colonies in Europe held in Paris and the International Peace and Democracy Conference. At that time, he and representatives from Asian countries such as China and India organized the Asia Group to jointly oppose colonialism. After returning to his country, Dr. Hatta continued to engage in patriotic activities. For the freedom and independence of Indonesia, he was repeatedly arrested and persecuted by colonialists, but the threats of the colonialists failed to destroy Dr. Hatta's patriotic will; on the contrary, what was destroyed was the colonialists' rule over Indonesia. On August 17, 1945, Dr. Hatta and President Sukarno solemnly announced the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia on behalf of the Indonesian people. Since then, Dr. Hatta has served as the Vice President of Indonesia for a long time, and also served as the Prime Minister of the Cabinet from 1948 to 1950. Dr. Hatta has made significant contributions to the independence and development of Indonesia.
    Although China and Indonesia are geographically far apart, the relationship between our two countries is becoming increasingly close. The friendship between our two peoples has deepened in the common struggle to maintain world peace and oppose colonialism. In recent years, the frequent contacts between leaders of our two governments and people from all walks of life have greatly strengthened the friendship and understanding between the two countries. We believe that Dr. Hatta's visit to our country this time will further strengthen the friendship between the two peoples.

    在政协扩大会议上
    周恩来主席的欢迎词尊敬的穆罕默德·哈达博士，朋友们，同志们：
  今天哈达博士来参加我们中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会召开的扩大会议，我们感到非常荣幸，让我们向他表示热烈的欢迎。
    尊敬的哈达博士，请允许我先把中国人民政治协商会议的性质简单地介绍一下。中国人民政治协商会议是全国各民主党派、各人民团体、各兄弟民族组成的人民民主统一战线的机构，是中国人民团结一致的具体表现。它对于中华人民共和国的成立和巩固发挥了很大的作用。随着我国人民民主统一战线的更加广泛和更加巩固，我们在国内能够更好地建设社会主义，在国外能够更好地同世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民加强友好关系，共同为保卫世界和平事业而努力。
    哈达博士的名字对于中国人民并不生疏。我们都知道哈达博士是印度尼西亚著名的政治家和经济学家。他早在学生时代就投身于反殖民主义的运动。在荷兰留学的时候，他曾经领导印度尼西亚协会进行反殖民主义斗争。1926年他曾经以印度尼西亚协会主席的身分，出席在巴黎召开的留欧远东殖民地学生大会和国际和平民主会议。当时他曾经同中国、印度等亚洲国家的代表组织了亚细亚集团，共同反对殖民主义。哈达博士回国以后，继续从事于爱国活动。为了印度尼西亚的自由和独立，他曾经多次遭到殖民主义者的逮捕和迫害，但是殖民主义者的威胁并没有能够摧毁哈达博士的爱国意志，相反的，被摧毁了的却是殖民主义者对印度尼西亚的统治。1945年8月17日哈达博士同苏加诺总统一起代表印度尼西亚人民庄严地宣布印度尼西亚共和国的成立。从那时起，哈达博士曾经长期担任印度尼西亚副总统的职务，在1948年到1950年间还曾兼任内阁总理的职位。哈达博士为了印度尼西亚的独立和发展曾经作出了重大的贡献。
    中国和印度尼西亚虽然在地理上相隔很远，但是，我们两国之间的关系却越来越密切。我们两国人民的友谊在维护世界和平和反殖民主义的共同斗争中日益加深起来。近年来我们两国政府领导人员和各方面人士多次的接触，大大地加强了两国相互之间的友谊和了解。我们相信，哈达博士这一次来我国访问将进一步加强两国人民之间的友谊。
