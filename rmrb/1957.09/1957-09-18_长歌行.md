Song of Everlasting Regret
Li Jishen

In the resolute struggle against the rightists, learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, I am inspired to compose this long song. I wish to encourage my comrades!

From ancient times, the masses have suffered in misery,
Labor has been scorned as the work of "inferior people." (Note 1)
The master and slave were sharply divided by status,
The saying "the people are valued, the ruler is light" was mere rhetoric. (Note 2)
The slave society is hardly worth discussing,
People were regarded as equal to cattle and horses.
In both feudal and capitalist societies,
Oppression and exploitation continued to follow the old ways.
The rise of Marxism-Leninism revealed the truth,
A revolution was needed to overturn the unjust society.

China had lagged behind for over a century,
The dark rule was the most prolonged.
Imperialism swept across the land,
Bureaucratic capitalists were like flies and dogs, (Note 3)
Sucking the marrow and blood, each fattening themselves,
The people suffered and their heads ached with pain.
China was reduced to a semi-colonial state,
How could the nation avoid destruction?

The success of the October Revolution began,
Marxism-Leninism proved to be the truth.
From then on, humanity saw the dawn of light,
The Chinese Communist Party organization had eyes like torches.
Sun Yat-sen rose up and struggled,
The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was like fish in water.
A high tide of great revolution was set off,
The situation progressed rapidly.
Alas, Mr. Sun's aspirations were not fulfilled,
Could the revolutionary cause be revived?

From then on, the fate of the nation became more precarious,
The dictatorial rule lasted for twenty years.
Internal and external troubles pressed upon each other,
The people suffered as if hanging upside down.
The territory shrank without end,
The land was ablaze with the flames of war.
The people were in deep water and scorching fire, and the disaster was extreme,
The national situation was perilous and fell into the abyss.
At this time, who led the revolution?
The Chinese Communist Party took up the responsibility without hesitation.
Calling for unity to resist the tyrannical Japanese,
The Long March north took the lead.
Making persistent efforts to frustrate the fierce flames,
The determination to persevere in the War of Resistance grew stronger.
Victory was not achieved by luck,
Powerful assistance relied on the Soviet Union.
The stubborn enemy has been destroyed, which is gratifying,
The great villain has not been eliminated and is acting recklessly again.
The revolution must be carried out thoroughly,
Eliminate evil and eradicate it completely. (Note 5)
Wherever the red flag points, everything is swept away,
The liberation is completed and a triumphant song is played.
China is reborn and the whole world celebrates,
The people have elected the wise leader, Chairman Mao.
Marxism-Leninism has been deeply understood,
The concrete practice is without deviation.
The scale is vast and the vision is far-sighted,
The grand blueprint is planned perfectly.
Holding the reins, he has the power to turn the tide,
Unification and unity are unprecedented in history.

The republic has only been established for eight years,
The world looks up with admiration.
The revolution has removed all the old evils,
Labor has opened up a new world.
The socialist system is superior,
The people's regime is independent and autonomous.
The foreign policy leans to one side,
The forces of peace are growing stronger day by day.
Construction is also supported by the Soviet Union,
The brilliant achievements are exceptionally rapid.
The country is becoming independent and prosperous,
The international status is shining with splendor.

The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party melts the hearts of the people,
As bright as the rising sun in the east.
The Party is deeply concerned about the national economy and people's livelihood,
How can neglected tasks be accomplished with a snap of the fingers? (Note 6)
The authorities are extremely eager to govern well,
They are always worried if even one person is not prosperous.
Collective wisdom brings success,
And they seek help from outside the Party to rectify work styles.
Humility and a broad mind like the sea,
Makes me deeply admire the Party's great impartiality.
Who would have thought that the rightist ambitionists,
Harbored sinister intentions and pretended to comply.
Maliciously pretending to do good,
Taking advantage of the opportunity to rob and plunder fiercely.
Their talent is enough to aid evildoers and deceive the masses,
Greed blinds their minds.
The Party and the people become the target,
Socialism is attacked at the same time.
Conspiracy, organization, and planning,
Starting fires everywhere and displaying their fierce fangs.
The bourgeois intellectuals,
Their ideology and consciousness remain unchanged.
Deeply poisoned by capitalist education,
Corrupted by vulgar customs, like worms in a corpse.
There are also those who are from the capitalist class,
Who only seek profit and are deeply entrenched in their minds.
Although the means of production have been handed over,
The bourgeois consciousness fills their minds.
As soon as they hear the rightists' glib tongue, (Note 7)
They willingly drink poison as if it were fine wine.
There are also former bureaucratic politicians,
Who once flaunted their power and authority.
They resist all reforms,
Spread rumors and slander, covering the sky like fog.
They only criticize from flaws,
Disregarding the great achievements and merits.
Their various fallacies are truly offensive,
They howl madly like a swarm of bees.
Their words and actions are all reactionary,
Resolutely fight and do not relax.
Turning back early is the shore,
Stubborn resistance will not be tolerated by the masses.

I also come from the old society,
Fortunately, I have been transformed as if awakened.
Stand firm, know right from wrong,
Draw a clear line and do not confuse things.
I am only ashamed of my dark vision and dull sense of smell,
How foolish I was not to recognize the traitors earlier.
Poisonous weeds grow secretly and harm the orchids,
If they are not removed, they will grow wild.
Fortunately, it is not too late to turn the tide,
The six criteria provide guidance.
Socialism is led by the Party,
Promote great righteousness and strike the bell of awakening.
Make every effort wholeheartedly,
The socialist revolution will surely succeed.
I hereby compose this long song to express my humble aspirations,
Seeking profound testing in my own conduct.

Note 1: Since the feudal rule of our country, the laboring people have always been despised and called "inferior people." See Confucius.
Note 2: Mencius said: The people are the most important, the state comes next, and the ruler is the least important.
Note 3: Han Yu's article, "Flies buzzing and dogs scurrying, driven away and returning." This refers to the collusion between imperialism and bureaucratic capital, which greatly harms the people's livelihood.
Note 4: Sun Yat-sen said: The success of the Russian October Revolution brought great hope to mankind.
Note 5: 搴 (qiān), to pull out. This refers to uprooting the reactionary forces.
Note 6: "Accomplished with a snap of the fingers." See the Book of Jin. This means that everything is waiting to be rebuilt and cannot be accomplished with a snap of the fingers.
Note 7: This refers to the rightists wagging their glib tongues to confuse the public.
