    The Love and Hate of a "Small Person"
    Dezhen
    The anti-Party element Li Youran calls himself "a small person." This "small person" also has his own "love" and "hate."

    When the Hungarian incident occurred and a wave of anti-communism appeared internationally, this "small person" gesticulated wildly, saying: "The opportunity has come," "Ding Ling's eyes were filled with joy"—this is the "small person's" love. He said: "I want to kill!" "Only now do I understand the line in 'Fisherman's Revenge' expressing 'to kill his entire family to eliminate the hatred in my heart'"—this is the "small person's" hate.

    Why does this Li Youran, who hangs the signboard of "Party member," love counter-revolutionary events and anti-Party elements so much, while hating the Party so much? It turns out that this person who calls himself a "small person" is not content with the status of a "small person." He said, "If a big event falls on my head, I will become a big person." Because the Party in the past did not satisfy his personal ambitions and desires for fame and position, and did not allow him to become a "big person," he has a deep-seated hatred for the Party, shouting "I hate! I hate!" "I regret participating in the revolution and joining the Party"; therefore, he is willing to act as a pawn for the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, frantically attacking the Party, with the aim of turning himself from a "small person" into a "big person."

    Party traitors and revolutionary scum like Li Youran are of course "small people" who can only be crushed by the wheels of the revolution. Wanting to be a "big person" is just a pipe dream.

    “小人物”的爱和恨
    德镇
    反党分子李又然自称“是一个小人物”。“小人物”也有自己的“爱”和“恨”。
    当匈牙利事件发生，国际上出现一股反共浪潮时，这个“小人物”手舞足蹈了，说：“时机到了”，“丁玲的眼睛都充满了快乐”，——这是这个“小人物”的爱。他说：“我要杀人！”“我现在才体会到‘打渔杀家’中的一句台词‘要杀他的全家，方消我的心头之恨’的情绪”，——这是这个“小人物”的恨。
    为什么这个挂着“党员”招牌的李又然对反革命事件、对反党分子如此之爱，而对党又如此之恨呢？原来是这个自称为“小人物”的人是不甘心于“小人物”的地位的。他说“大事件落在我头上，我就变成大人物了”。由于党过去没有满足他的个人野心，名位欲望，让他成为“大人物”，所以他就与党有了刻骨之仇，叫嚣着“我仇恨！我仇恨”，“我很后悔参加革命、入党”；所以他就甘愿充当丁陈反党集团的走卒，疯狂向党进攻，目的无非是为了把他自己由“小人物”变成“大人物”。
    像李又然这样的党的叛徒，革命的渣滓，当然是个“小人物”，只能被革命的车轮碾碎，想做“大人物”不过是一场幻梦罢了。
