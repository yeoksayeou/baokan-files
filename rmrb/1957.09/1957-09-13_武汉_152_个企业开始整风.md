Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Since August, one hundred and fifty-two factories and enterprises in Wuhan have successively begun a rectification campaign. This is the first batch of units in Wuhan to carry out rectification in factories and enterprises.

　　Under the call of "Promote Democracy, Help Rectification, Speak Freely" put forward by various factories and enterprises, the broad masses of workers and staff have adopted forms such as big-character posters and discussion meetings. In the past month, they have put forward many opinions and criticisms, many of which expose the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in the work of enterprise leaders. For example, 136 employees of the Wuhan Battery Factory put forward 1,246 opinions in ten days, of which 281 were related to production management and ideological education.

　　From the very beginning, this batch of factories and enterprises emphasized that rectification should be carried out alongside improvement. Some units have already resolved or are in the process of resolving 70% to 80% or more of the correct opinions put forward by the workers. Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill, Wuhan Power Machinery Factory, Hankou Automobile Parts Factory, and others have all dispatched a number of leading cadres to workshops to strengthen leadership at the workshop level, in accordance with the spirit of "rectifying while correcting." Many units have also established leading bodies for "rectifying while correcting," led by members of the Chinese Communist Party Committee in the enterprise, organizing special forces to concentrate on, study, and resolve problems. Some factories have also compiled and distributed "Rectifying While Correcting" express reports, or posted news about improved work on big-character posters in a timely manner.

　　武汉152个企业开始整风
    据新华社讯　武汉市有一百五十二个工厂、企业自八月份以来先后开始整风。这是武汉市在工厂、企业中进行整风的第一批单位。
    在各工厂、企业提出的“发扬民主、帮助整风、畅所欲言”的号召下，广大职工群众采用大字报、座谈会等形式，近一个月来提出了很多意见和批评，其中有不少是揭发企业领导工作中的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的。如武汉电池厂一百三十六名职工在十天中提出的一千二百四十六条意见，其中有二百八十一条是有关生产管理和思想教育工作方面的。
    这一批工厂、企业，从整风一开始，就强调提出要一边整风，一边改进。有些单位对于职工群众提出的正确意见，已经解决或正着手解决的已达百分之七、八十以上。武昌第一纱厂、武汉动力机厂、汉口汽车配件厂等，都已根据“边整边改”的精神，把一批领导干部下放到车间去，加强了车间的领导。不少单位还成立了“边整边改”的领导机构，由企业里的中国共产党委员会成员分工领导，组织专门力量，集中、研究和解决问题。有的工厂还编发了“边整边改”快报，或在大字报上及时发布改进工作的消息。
