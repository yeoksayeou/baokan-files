Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd. The Guangzhou Railway Administration has universally established "rectify while correcting" groups, responsible for studying and handling problems raised by employees that are urgently needed to be solved and can be solved.

Currently, the bureau and its affiliated units have mostly formulated systems for going deep into reality and connecting with the masses. The Zhuzhou Railway Sub-bureau stipulates that each unit must designate a specific person to be responsible for handling letters from the masses, and the Sub-bureau Director's Office inspects them once or twice a week to ensure that there is no backlog, that every letter is answered, and that important letters from the masses must be handled personally by the Sub-bureau Director or the person in charge of the unit. The Nanchang Partition Trade Union stipulates that trade union members should participate in the research work of grassroots trade unions by division of labor, and spend at least two-thirds of their time going deep into the grassroots every month. Leading cadres of the Hengyang Railway Sub-bureau recently formed two working groups to go deep into sixteen stations to inspect the implementation of the production increase and economy plan. At present, problems found that can be solved within the authority of the Sub-bureau have been solved, and the employees and the masses have responded very well.

In the process of rectification, some unreasonable treatments of leading cadres of the Guangzhou Railway Administration and its affiliated units have been abolished. The phenomenon of leading cadres taking cars for private matters has disappeared. Many cadres above the department level now take public buses when traveling on official business. In terms of employees' living welfare, problems that are urgently needed and can be solved are also solved as much as possible. For example, the housing problem, which is of most concern to the masses, has been planned to build more than 22,000 square meters of new houses this year, and improve the necessary public housing equipment. The Hengyang Railway Sub-bureau has also adjusted the original dormitories. In order to enable employees at small stations along the line to buy daily necessities in time, the Guangzhou Employee Living Supply Section of the bureau has added a supply vehicle to regularly transport daily necessities to small stations along the line for sale. Some improvement measures have also been taken in the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases, labor protection, and enrollment of employees' children in schools.

    能解决的问题就及时解决  广州铁路管理局边整边改
    新华社广州23日电　广州铁路管理局普遍成立“边整边改”小组，负责研究和处理职工提出的急需解决而又可能解决的问题。
    目前，这个局和所属各单位大都制定了深入实际、联系群众的制度。株洲铁路分局规定：各单位必须指定专人负责处理群众来信，并由分局长办公室每周检查一次到两次，保证做到不积压，件件有答复，重要的群众来信，必须由分局长或单位负责人亲自处理。南昌分区工会规定：工会委员要分工参加基层工会研究工作，每月至少有三分之二的时间深入基层。衡阳铁路分局领导干部最近组成了两个工作组，分头深入到十六个车站检查增产节约计划执行情况。目前，发现的问题中属于分局权限内能够解决的问题，都已解决了，职工群众反映很好。
    在整风过程中，广州铁路管理局和所属各单位领导干部的某些不合理的待遇都已经取消，领导干部因私事坐小汽车的现象没有了，处级以上干部因公出差的时候很多都改坐公共汽车。在职工生活福利方面，也尽可能地解决那些急需而又可能解决的问题。如群众最关心的住房问题，已经计划在今年内再新建二万二千多平方公尺住宅，并改善必要的公房设备。衡阳铁路分局还对原有宿舍作了调整。为了使沿线小站的职工都能及时买到生活用品，这个局广州职工生活供应段已经添置了一辆供应车，定期把生活用品运到沿线小站销售。在防治职业病、劳动保护和职工子弟入学等方面，也都采取了一些改进的措施。
