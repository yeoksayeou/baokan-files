Educate Hesitant and Wait-and-See Masses to Participate in the Struggle
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: Wuhan Industrial and Commercial Circles Expose Another Group of Rightists

	Wuhan, September 18th (Xinhua News Agency) - Industrial and commercial figures in Wuhan have overcome right-leaning sentiments and tendencies toward leniency, allowing the anti-Rightist struggle to gradually deepen. Over the past month, they have exposed another group of new Rightist elements.

	In the initial stage of the anti-Rightist struggle in Wuhan's industrial and commercial circles, many businesspeople feared that the struggle would "go too far," believing that "the small Rightists in the districts have nothing to confess," and that "the Rightists have already been criticized enough." They adopted a hesitant and wait-and-see attitude toward the anti-Rightist struggle, creating some obstacles.

	In order to help them overcome right-leaning sentiments and tendencies toward leniency, organizations such as the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association held large-scale reports, organized heart-to-heart talks and individual conversations, introduced them to the crimes of the Rightists, solicited their opinions, explained the policies in detail, dispelled their ideological concerns, and asked them to help with the work, which raised the awareness of many people. Hu Jingzhai, director and private representative of the Xinzhong Native Produce and Paper Store, a joint state-private enterprise in the Jianghan District, and Li Rensun, a Standing Committee member of the Jianghan District Federation of Industry and Commerce and a Rightist, had studied together in a private sector training class and had a good grasp of Li Rensun's anti-Communist and anti-socialist materials. However, he was initially unwilling to expose them, feeling that they had studied and lived together in the same group for more than four months, and they were familiar with each other, making it difficult to bring himself to expose him. After education and help from all sides, he realized that others were working hard to build socialism, while the Rightists were digging at the foundation of socialism; he realized that showing leniency in the struggle against the Rightists was showing ruthlessness to the people. Therefore, they actively exposed Li Rensun's reactionary remarks during his studies, such as slandering the Party's policies and the "experience" of driving away the public representatives. During his spare time, Hu Jingzhai also went to other districts three times to invite businesspeople who had studied in the same group to recall and study Li Rensun's anti-Communist remarks, invite them to participate in the struggle meeting, and collect some of Li Rensun's reactionary manuscripts. With ample evidence and witnesses, the Rightist Li Rensun had no choice but to admit his guilt. Jiang Hualin, a youth in the Wuchang District industrial and commercial circles, used to be a very active person, but he became silent in the anti-Rightist struggle. He originally believed that the criticism of Liu Guangren, Deputy Director of the District Federation of Industry and Commerce and a Rightist, was due to contradictions among the leaders of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, creating factionalism. After the District Federation of Industry and Commerce understood his ideological situation, they invited him to accompany them when verifying the materials of Liu Guangren's criminal remarks. When he realized that the materials exposed by everyone were all true, he suddenly realized and took active action, collecting materials about the Rightists everywhere, and contacting and mobilizing people who had the same ideological problems as him to participate in the struggle.

　　对右派温情就是对人民无情
　　教育犹疑观望的群众参加斗争
    武汉工商界又揪出一批右派分子
    新华社武汉讯　武汉市工商业者克服右倾情绪和温情主义，使反右派斗争逐步深入，一个多月来，又揪出一批新的右派分子。
    武汉市工商界反右派斗争的前一阶段，有不少工商业者害怕斗争“过火”，认为“区里的小右派分子无什么反头”，“右派分子已经反得差不多了”。他们对反右派斗争抱犹疑观望的态度，使反右派斗争遇到一些阻力。
    武汉市和各区工商联、民建会等组织，为了帮助他们克服右倾情绪和温情主义，举办了大报告，组织了谈心会和个别交谈，向他们介绍右派分子的罪行，征求他们的意见，并且详细解释政策，解除他们的思想顾虑，还请他们帮助进行工作，使很多人提高了觉悟。江汉区公私合营新中土产纸张商店主任、私方人员胡靖斋，和江汉区工商联常委、右派分子李仁荪在私方人员讲习班一起学习过，掌握了很多李仁荪反共反社会主义的材料。但是，他开始不肯揭露，觉得同在一个小组学习、生活了四个多月，彼此很熟悉，总有些揭不下脸皮。经过各方面对他教育和帮助，他认识到别人在辛辛苦苦建设社会主义，而右派分子却在挖社会主义的墙脚；认识到斗争右派分子有温情主义，就是对人民无情。因此，他们积极揭露了李仁荪在学习时所散布的诬蔑党的政策和赶走公方代表的“经验”等反动言行。胡靖斋还在休息时间，三次到外区去邀请原来在一个小组学习过的工商业者一起回忆和研究李仁荪的反共言行，邀他们参加斗争会，同时搜集到李仁荪的一些反动文稿。由于人证物证俱全，右派分子李仁荪不得不低头认罪。武昌区工商界青年江华林，过去是一个很活跃的人物，可是在反右派斗争中却沉默起来，原来他认为所以批判区工商联副主任委员、右派分子刘广仁，是因为工商联领导之间有矛盾，闹宗派。区工商联了解他的思想情况以后，就在对证刘广仁罪恶言行的材料时，邀请他同去。当他发觉大家揭露出的材料都是千真万确的事实时，恍然大悟，积极行动起来，到处搜集右派分子的材料，并且串连、发动和他有同样思想问题的人参加斗争。
