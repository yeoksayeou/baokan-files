Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - TASS reports: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that, in the future, it is necessary to stop naming states, districts, cities, villages, enterprises, collective farms, institutions, and organizations after living state leaders, socio-political activists, and figures in science and culture. The order issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 11th addressed this issue.

The order stipulates that, in the future, the practice of naming places after outstanding activists to commemorate them forever will only be implemented after their death, on special occasions, and based on the requests of the working people, Soviet organizations, and social groups.

The order stipulates the naming system and considers it appropriate to change the names of states, districts, cities, enterprises, collective farms, institutions, and organizations that are currently named after politicians and social activists who are still alive.

The issuance of the order is to eliminate the shortcomings existing in naming work and to establish a proper system. The order states that "great mistakes have been made in this regard, and Lenin's traditions have been violated."

The order states that the great Lenin taught the Soviet people to be humble, and Lenin himself was a model of humility and simplicity, and he was extremely opposed to glorifying his name.

The first cities named after Lenin were Leningrad and Ulyanovsk. This was done in 1924 after his death to express the Soviet people's boundless love for their leader and teacher and to make his glorious name immortal.

The order points out that during the period when the atmosphere of the personality cult prevailed, a large number of districts, cities, towns, enterprises, collective farms, and schools at all levels were named after living politicians and social activists. This practice excessively exaggerated certain individuals, devalued the role of the Party as a collective leader and organizer of the masses, and did not help to educate cadres in the correct, Party-minded spirit of humility.

### 列宁教导人们要谦逊　苏联规定新的命名制度　停止以活着的人名命名地方、企业和机关

　　列宁教导人们要谦逊
　　苏联规定新的命名制度
　　停止以活着的人名命名地方、企业和机关
    据新华社莫斯科12日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联最高苏维埃主席团认为，今后必须停止用活着的国家领导人、社会政治活动家以及科学文化界人士的名字来命名州、区、市、村、企业、集体农庄、机关和团体。苏联最高苏维埃主席团11日颁布的命令谈到了这个问题。
    命令规定，今后为了永远纪念杰出的活动家而以他们的名字来命名的做法，只有在他们死后，在特殊的场合下，根据劳动人民、苏维埃组织和社会团体的请求才能实行。
    命令规定了命名的制度，并且认为，更改用迄今还健在的政治家和社会活动家的名字命名的州、区、市、企业、集体农庄、机关和团体的名称是合宜的。
    命令的颁布是为了消除命名工作方面存在的缺点和建立适当的制度。命令说，在这方面“已经犯了很大的错误和违背了列宁的传统”。
    命令说，伟大的列宁教导苏联人要谦逊，而列宁自己就是谦逊和纯朴的典型，他极端反对颂扬他的名字。
    第一次以列宁的名字命名的城市是列宁格勒和乌里扬诺夫斯克，那是在1924年当他逝世后，为了表示苏联人民对自己领袖和导师的无比爱戴和为了使他的英名永垂不朽才这样做的。
    命令指出：在个人崇拜的风气盛行时期，大批的区、市、镇、企业、集体农庄和各级学校都以活着的政治家和社会活动家的名字来命名。这种做法过分地夸大了某些个人，贬低了党作为集体领导者和群众组织者的作用，无助于以正确的、党的谦逊精神来教育干部。
