　　"Radio Free Europe" was the Director of the Hungarian October Counter-Revolution
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Ji-bang
　　In the past, the Hungarian government long neglected the enemy’s propaganda offensive on the ideological front, believing a good idiom: "The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on." Indeed, although Western countries have not stopped slandering Hungary for twelve years, socialist construction has continued.
　　When imperialism changed its propaganda strategy toward the socialist camp in 1956, and when it found resonance in Hungary within the Petőfi Circle and the "Literary Gazette," the propaganda machine of Western countries, especially "Radio Free Europe," which was created single-handedly by the United States, brought disastrous consequences to Hungary.
　　Whenever Hungarians talk about the ideological confusion, brutal bloodshed, huge losses from strikes, and the blind exodus of young people caused during the period from October to November last year, they cannot forgive the evil activities of "Radio Free Europe." Even some newspapers in capitalist countries have condemned it for this, believing that its aggressive propaganda and irresponsible lies should bear a huge responsibility for the bloodshed in Hungary.
　　However, the so-called "Hungarian Problem" report of the United Nations Special Committee praises the role of this infamous "Radio Free Europe," while keeping silent about its destructive role, only saying lightly that some broadcasts seemed "not restrained enough." What role did "Radio Free Europe" play in the Hungarian incident that deserves the praise of the United Nations Special Committee? When people understand this truth, they can also understand what kind of stuff the "Hungarian Problem Report" compiled by this committee is.
　　Near the English Garden in the suburbs of Munich, West Germany, there are thirty-two broadcasting towers, twenty-eight shortwave stations distributed in various countries, twenty-five broadcasting studios, a large number of news agencies, and a large number of spies. The radio station's annual operating expenses are more than 10 million US dollars. It has five groups for Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. The Hungarian group alone has one hundred and thirty-two staff members, many of whom are Hungarian exiles acting as American spies.
　　From its inception to 1955, "Radio Free Europe" consistently carried out open anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-socialist propaganda. Since the spring of 1956, after imperialism and Hungarian exile groups changed their propaganda strategies and advocated so-called "national communism," the radio station specially added a program for broadcasting to party members. The propaganda policy before last October was to use the slogans of "democratization" and nationalistic sentiments to exaggerate the party's mistakes, especially the mistakes of violating the rule of law, and to provoke hatred towards the party, the public security forces, and the Soviet Union. The Hungarian exiled bourgeoisie used the radio to promote so-called "national communism," while praising Nagy as a "communist representing the national interests of Hungary," and praising the discussions held by the Petőfi Circle and the speeches of the Hungarian Writers' Association, inciting the "revolutionary traditions" of Hungarian youth. In this way, the Nagy group quickly formed an ideological united front with "Radio Free Europe," colluding from within and without, causing the broad masses to gradually lose their way and not be able to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. What happened in Hungary was often quickly reacted to by "Radio Free Europe." "Radio Free Europe" broadcast in Hungarian for twelve hours a day, and during the incident, it increased to twenty hours. Therefore, it played the role of organizer, mobilizer, and commander for the counter-revolutionaries in the Hungarian October incident.
　　Around September last year, the US Congress, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and exile organizations in Munich all held meetings to discuss the decision to subvert Hungary, and also determined the propaganda policy for "Radio Free Europe." They determined the following two stages for the radio's propaganda: the first stage, from October 23rd to 29th, was a transitional period; the second stage, from October 29th to November 4th, was the beginning of the restoration period. The requirements of the first stage were to destroy the state power organs, disarm the revolutionary armed forces, declare the party illegal, and demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops; the second stage was to overthrow the socialist system and implement bourgeois restoration. At that time, the various counter-revolutionary organizations in Hungary, although their actions were not consistent, basically followed the instructions given by "Radio Free Europe."
　　Nagy's betrayal in the first stage was blatantly manifested in the statement on October 28th. In this statement, he admitted that the counter-revolutionary riots declared on the 24th were a national democratic revolutionary movement. In this way, counter-revolutionary bandits and traitors, such as Dudás, Király, and Maléter, became "revolutionary" leaders who could legally be active on the political stage. After these "leaders" came forward, the old Horthy officers and bandits immediately came out.
　　Nagy announced a general ceasefire, which resulted in the disarmament of the revolution and opened the way for free activity for the counter-revolution.
　　Nagy dissolved the public security forces and the guards, resulting in the armed forces being transferred to the enemy. Dudás's bandits also took the guard's documents and called themselves legitimate soldiers. The white terror began the day after the Soviet troops withdrew from Budapest, so October 29th marked the completion of the first stage of the counter-revolutionary strategy.
　　In the second stage, Nagy's generous acts of betrayal could no longer satisfy the demands of Western countries, who were considering that Mindszenty, who was waiting in prison, could come on stage to perform.
　　At this time, "Radio Free Europe" military commentator Colonel Bell broadcast against the ceasefire order, calling on the "freedom fighters" not to fall for Nagy's Trojan horse, not to lay down their arms, and to bravely continue fighting. The next day, Dudás's fascist bandits launched a large-scale attack on the headquarters of the Budapest Municipal Party Committee in Republic Square. The broadcaster cunningly carried out propaganda to disarm the revolutionary armed forces, saying that everyone in uniform might be "public security forces." This extended the "terror against the public security forces" to the terror against all revolutionary soldiers. On the streets, even firefighters were massacred as public security forces. From the 30th, various armed groups immediately searched houses along the streets to arrest "red elements." White terror began under the instigation of "Radio Free Europe."
　　On the 31st, Colonel Bell issued instructions to the "freedom fighters" again: "Demand that communists withdraw from the army," "Demand the positions of Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff, and demand the appointment of Maléter as Minister of Defense." On November 3rd, Maléter was indeed appointed Minister of Defense. Király, a Horthy officer who was released from prison in the summer of 1956, was promoted from Major General to Commander-in-Chief of the Guards.
　　On October 31st, counter-revolutionaries escorted Mindszenty from prison to Budapest in a triumphal procession. On this day, various revolutionary committees representing the power organs were established in various places. On November 3rd, Mindszenty publicly announced that the purpose of the "revolution" was to restore private ownership and demanded the return of church land.
　　"Radio Free Europe" slandered the Soviet government's statement on October 30th, incited the tearing up of the Warsaw Pact, declared Hungary's neutrality, and said that all treaties concluded during the communist rule should be declared invalid. Király firmly demanded an immediate withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, and Dudás's newspaper strongly supported this demand. Nagy executed this demand the next day, unilaterally declared neutrality without the approval of the parliament, and put forward the demand to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact.
　　On this day, Eisenhower said triumphantly: A new day is dawning in Eastern Europe. After the establishment of the worker-peasant revolutionary government on November 4th, "Radio Free Europe" continued to call on Hungarian counter-revolutionaries to continue fighting, deceiving the "fighters" that Western military assistance was about to arrive, demanding that they persevere, and instigating workers to strike in order to confront the worker-peasant revolutionary government and the Soviet Union. Armed bandits, according to the radio's instructions, threatened and framed honest working people who were willing to resume work.
　　During November and December, "Radio Free Europe" again used various deceptive lies to influence young people to flee to the West, causing thousands of family tragedies.
　　This unprecedented and unscrupulous interference by "Radio Free Europe" has aroused condemnation from world opinion. Now, the Hungarian government and people have learned a profound lesson and will never allow "Radio Free Europe" to direct similar tragedies again.

### “自由欧洲”电台是匈牙利十月反革命事件的导演者

　　“自由欧洲”电台是匈牙利十月反革命事件的导演者
　　本报记者　胡济邦
    匈牙利政府过去在思想战线上长期忽视了敌人的宣传进攻，相信了一句好的成语“狗尽管狂叫，马队仍在前进”。的确，十二年来西方国家虽没有停止过对匈牙利的诬蔑，但社会主义建设继续在进行。
    当1956年帝国主义改变它对社会主义阵营的宣传策略以后，当它在匈牙利境内得到裴多菲俱乐部和“文学报”等的共鸣时，西方国家的宣传机器，特别是为美国一手创办的“自由欧洲”电台，便给匈牙利带来灾难性的后果。
    匈牙利人每谈到去年10月至11月期间所引起的思想混乱、残酷的流血、损失巨大的罢工和青少年们的盲目逃亡等一系列悲惨事件时，就不能饶恕“自由欧洲”电台的罪恶活动。关于这一点，甚至连资本主义国家的某些报刊也对它作过谴责，认为它的侵略性的宣传和不负责任的谎言，对匈牙利流血事件应负巨大责任。
    但是，联合国特别委员会的所谓“匈牙利问题”的报告，对这个臭名昭彰的“自由欧洲”电台的作用却加以赞扬，而对于“自由欧洲”电台的破坏作用却闭口不谈，只轻描淡写地说某些广播似乎“不够克制”。“自由欧洲”电台在匈牙利事变中究竟起了什么作用，而值得联合国特别委员会加以赞扬呢？当人们了解了这一真相以后，也就可以由此了解这个委员会所编著的“匈牙利问题报告”究竟是什么货色了。
    在西德慕尼黑近郊的英国花园附近，耸立着三十二个广播塔，建立了二十八个分布各国的短波站，二十五个广播室，成立大量通讯社，派遣大批间谍人员。电台每年活动经费在一千万美元以上，内设匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚五个组，仅匈牙利组就有一百三十二个工作人员，其中有许多是充当美国间谍的匈牙利流亡分子。
    从创办开始到1955年，“自由欧洲”电台一贯进行公开的反苏、反共、反社会主义的宣传。从1956年春，帝国主义及匈牙利流亡集团改变宣传策略，鼓吹所谓“民族共产主义”以后，电台特别增设一项对党员广播的节目。去年10月以前的宣传方针是利用“民主化”的口号和民族主义情绪夸大党的错误，特别是违反法制的错误，挑拨对党、对公安军和对苏联的憎恨。匈牙利流亡资产阶级通过电台宣传所谓“民族共产主义”，同时称赞纳吉是“代表匈牙利民族利益的共产党人”，颂扬裴多菲俱乐部举行的讨论会和匈牙利作家协会的言论，煽动匈牙利青年的“革命传统”。这样，纳吉集团很快便和“自由欧洲”电台结成了思想上的统一战线，里应外合，使广大群众逐渐迷失方向，分不清敌我。在匈牙利所发生的事情经常得到“自由欧洲”电台的迅速反应。“自由欧洲”电台每天用匈文广播十二小时，事件期间，增至二十小时。因此，它在匈牙利十月事件中对反革命分子扮演着组织、动员和发号施令者的角色。
    去年9月间，美国国会、北大西洋集团和慕尼黑的流亡组织都先后召开会议，商讨颠覆匈牙利的决策，也为“自由欧洲”电台确定了宣传方针。它们为电台的宣传确定了下面两个阶段：第一阶段从10月23日到29日，是过渡时期；第二阶段从10月29日到11月4日，是复辟开始时期。第一阶段的要求是摧毁国家政权机构，解除革命武装，宣布党为非法，要求苏军撤退；第二阶段是推翻社会主义制度，实行资产阶级复辟。当时匈牙利国内的各种反革命组织，行动虽然不一致，但对“自由欧洲”电台提出的指示基本上都遵照执行了。
    纳吉在第一阶段的出卖行为，露骨地表现在10月28日的声明中。在这个声明中，他承认24日所声明过的反革命暴乱是民族民主的革命运动。这样一来，反革命匪帮和叛徒，像杜达什、基拉伊和马勒特都变成“革命”领导者，可以合法地活跃在政治舞台上。自从这些“领袖们”出头露面后，旧时的霍尔蒂军官和匪徒都立刻出来了。
  纳吉宣布普遍停火，结果解除了革命的武装，为反革命打开了自由活动的道路。
    纳吉解散公安军、警卫军，结果是武装力量过渡到敌人手中。杜达什匪徒们也拿着警卫军的证件把自己称为合法的战士了。在苏军撤出布达佩斯的第二天便开始了白色恐怖，因此10月29日已标志着反革命战略的第一阶段已完成。
    在第二阶段，纳吉这些慷慨的出卖行为，并不能再满足西方国家的要求，西方国家在考虑等候在监牢中的明曾蒂已可出台上演的时候了。
    这时，“自由欧洲”电台军事评论员贝尔上校便广播反对停火令，叫“自由战士”们不要上纳吉的木马计，不要放下武器，要勇往向前继续战斗。第二天，杜达什的法西斯匪帮，就大规模进攻共和国广场的布达佩斯市党委总部了。广播员曾狡猾地进行解除革命武装的宣传，说每个穿军装的人可能都是“公安军”。这样就把“反对公安军的恐怖”扩大到反对所有革命军人的恐怖了。在大街上，连消防队员也被当作公安军屠杀。从30日起，各武装小组马上沿街挨户搜查逮捕“赤色分子”。白色恐怖在“自由欧洲”电台的鼓动下开始了。
    31日，贝尔上校又向“自由战士”发出指示：“要求共产党人退出军队”，“要求国防部长和参谋长的职位，并要求任命马勒特为国防部长。”到11月3日，马勒特果然当了国防部长。1956年夏从监牢放出来的霍尔蒂军官基拉伊由少将参谋升为警卫军总司令。
    10月31日，反革命分子用凯旋式的行列把明曾蒂从监狱护送到布达佩斯。这一天，代表政权机构的各种革命委员会在各地成立了。11月3日，明曾蒂公开宣布“革命”的目的是恢复私有制，要求归还教会的地产。
    “自由欧洲”电台诬蔑苏联政府10月30日的声明，鼓动撕毁华沙条约，宣布匈牙利中立，说在共产党统治时期缔结的一切条约都应宣布无效。基拉伊便坚决要求立即退出华沙条约，杜达什的报纸也极力支持这个要求。纳吉第二天就执行了这个要求，未经国会批准，便擅自片面宣布中立，提出退出华沙条约的要求。
    这一天，艾森豪威尔得意地说：东欧新的一天黎明了。在11月4日工农革命政府成立以后，“自由欧洲”电台仍号召匈牙利反革命分子继续作战，欺骗“战士们”说，西方的军事援助就要到来，要求坚持下去，对工人挑拨罢工，以对抗工农革命政府和苏联。武装匪徒则根据电台指示，对愿意复工的诚实劳动人民实行威胁和陷害。
    在11—12月期间，“自由欧洲”电台又以各种欺人的谎言来影响青年人逃往西方，造成了成千上万的家庭悲剧。
    “自由欧洲”电台这种史无前例的肆无忌惮的干涉，已引起世界舆论的谴责。现在，匈牙利政府和人民已经接受了深刻的教训，决不会容许“自由欧洲”电台再来导演类似的悲剧了。
