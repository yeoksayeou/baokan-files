The Crystallization of Sino-Hungarian Friendship
Yang Jun, Director of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine and Tractor Station

Dear Premier Kádár and all comrades of the delegation, today, as you come to China for a friendly visit, I, on behalf of all the staff and workers of our station, extend to you our warm welcome and heartfelt respect.

In 1955, during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in our country, the Hungarian People's Government donated a complete set of equipment for a tractor station to our country and sent four experts to help us build the station. I felt that this was a concrete manifestation of the great internationalist spirit, a concrete manifestation of the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples. I was appointed as the director of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine and Tractor Station, and I also felt extremely honored.

Our station performs fifteen types of mechanized operations throughout the year, with a total workload of 100,600 converted mu, of which 60,958 converted mu are tractor operations. Each GS-35 tractor averages 4,689 converted mu, equivalent to 3,907 standard units. In 1956, under the correct leadership of our Party and with the help of four Hungarian agricultural technology experts, namely Vatter, Banha, Ville, and Bidi, we achieved great success in agricultural mechanization. The actual total workload completed throughout the year was 166,719 converted mu, accounting for 157.28% of the annual plan, of which tractor operations completed 89,067.76 converted mu, accounting for 146.11% of the annual plan. The workload of each GS-35 tractor reached a maximum of 8,123.81 converted mu and a minimum of 5,703.62 converted mu. Due to the increase in class efficiency and the reduction in unit fuel consumption, the production cost was also reduced. The annual cost per mu was reduced by 0.58 yuan compared to the original plan.

Since its establishment, our station has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. The quality of the fifteen types of operations carried out by our station has basically reached the prescribed standards and agricultural requirements, generally ensuring increased production. For example, in the Jianguo Agricultural Cooperative in Xinzhuang Township, Qufu County, the yield of soybeans cultivated and sown by machines was 196.36 jin per mu, while the yield of soybeans cultivated and sown by manual labor was 163.06 jin per mu. In the same situation, the yield of corn planted by some cooperatives increased by more than double. This dispelled the masses' concerns about whether mechanized operations could increase production and strengthened the farmers' confidence and determination to gradually embark on the road of agricultural mechanization through agricultural cooperativization. Our station has achieved great success in the past year or so, which is inseparable from the help of Hungarian experts.

Hungarian experts have trained a group of agricultural machinery service backbones for us. After the experts arrived at the station, they immediately opened a training class for machinery personnel. Under the personal lectures and guidance of the experts, the comrades at the station understood the general principles of various agricultural implements such as GS-35 tractors and AC-400 combine harvesters, and learned the operating methods such as use, maintenance, and adjustment. Most of the comrades served as captains, foremen, or machinery technicians in the machine耕站.

The experts' serious and responsible, meticulous, and hardworking style left a deep impression on us. The experts insisted on working even in winter when the temperature was below minus ten degrees Celsius. They always lay or knelt on the ground, regardless of the dirt, to carefully disassemble and inspect each part during working hours. In the summer, under the guidance of experts, we carried out fifteen types of operations, including plowing, harrowing, sowing, stubble removal, combine harvesting, cutting and binding, threshing, pest control, seed selection, pumping, corn threshing, pressing, and square spot sowing. Although we lacked experience and our technology was not high, we successfully completed the task thanks to the experts' specific assistance. When the experts went to a team to inspect the work, they always did it themselves regardless of the hot weather, and consciously cultivated and improved our skills by repairing and adjusting the machines. In addition, they also held two training classes for station directors, accountants, and other personnel, so that the comrades who participated in the training classes mastered the management experience of Hungarian agricultural tractor stations. As a result, the chaotic situation at the beginning of our station's establishment gradually disappeared, and we embarked on a regular path. What particularly moved us was that the Hungarian experts were still tirelessly helping us with our work the day before they were about to leave our station and return to their country. This close brotherly affection and this high degree of internationalist spirit not only deeply moved us, but also strengthened our confidence and determination to run the station well.

Although our station has made great achievements with the active help of experts, I personally lack experience in leadership. In the future, I must continue to study and research the advanced experience of Hungarian agricultural tractor stations that I have learned in the past, and better apply them to practical work to do a good job to thank the Hungarian people and the Hungarian government for their help to us, and always maintain the honor of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine and Tractor Station.

Now, on behalf of all the staff of our station, I would like to wish Premier Kádár and all the comrades of the delegation good health and happiness, and wish the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples a long life! (Attached picture)

### 中匈友谊的结晶

    中匈友谊的结晶
    中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站站长　杨俊
    亲爱的卡达尔总理和全体团员同志，今天，当你们来中国进行友好访问的时候，我代表全站职工同志向你们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    正当我国农业合作化高潮的1955年，匈牙利人民政府赠送我国一个拖拉机站的全套设备，并派了四位专家帮助我们建站。我感到这是伟大的国际主义精神的具体表现，这是中匈两国人民兄弟般的友谊的具体表现。我被任命为中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站站长，也感到无比的光荣。
    我站全年机械作业共十五种，总工作量为十万零六千折熟亩，其中拖拉机作业六万零九百五十八折熟亩。每台GS—35机车平均为四千六百八十九折熟亩，折合标准台为三千九百零七折熟亩。1956年，在我党的正确领导下，在瓦特尔纳、班哈西、维莱士、比迪等四位匈牙利农业技术专家的帮助下，农业机械作业取得了巨大的成就。实际全年完成的总工作量为十六万六千七百一十九折熟亩，占全年计划的157.28％，其中拖拉机作业完成八万九千零六十七点七六折熟亩，占全年计划的146.11％。每台GS—35机车工作量最高达八千一百二十三点八一折熟亩，最低达五千七百零三点六二折熟亩。由于班效率的提高和单位耗油量的降低，因而生产成本也有所降低，全年每亩比原计划成本降低零点五八元。
    我站自建站开始以来就受到了广大农民的热烈的欢迎。我站所进行的十五种作业的质量，基本上达到了规定的标准和农业上的要求，一般的保证了增产。例如，在曲阜县辛庄乡建国农业社，机耕机播的大豆每亩产量一百九十六点三六斤，而耒耕自播的每亩产量一百六十三点零六斤。有的社种的玉米，同样的情况下增产一倍以上。因而打破了群众对机械作业是否能增产的顾虑，也增强了农民由农业合作化逐渐走上农业机械化道路的信心和决心。一年多以来，我站能取得了很大的成绩，是与匈牙利专家的帮助分不开的。
    匈牙利专家为我们培养训练了一批农业机械服务骨干。专家来站后即开办了机务人员训练班。在专家们亲自讲课和指导下，站上的同志们懂得了GS—35机车、AC—400联合收割机等各种农具的一般原理，学会了使用、保养、调整等操作方法。绝大部分同志担任了机耕站的队长、车长或机务技术员。
    专家们认真负责、丝毫不苟、艰苦朴实的工作作风给我们留下了深刻的印象。专家们在冬季零下十度以下仍是坚持工作，他们在工作的时间总是不嫌脏地卧在或跪在地上认真拆卸、检查每一个机件。在夏季，在专家指导下，开展了耕、耙、播、灭茬、联合收割机收割、割捆、脱谷、治虫、选种、抽水、玉米脱粒、镇压、方形点播等十五种作业。虽然我们缺乏经验、技术不高，但是由于专家们的具体帮助，使我们顺利地完成了任务。专家们每深入一个队检查工作时，不顾炎热的气候，总是亲自动手，并通过对机器的修理、调整有意识地培养、提高了我们的技术。此外，还开办了两次站长、会计等人员训练班，使参加训练班的同志们都掌握了匈牙利农业拖拉机站的管理经验。因而，使我站刚建站时的混乱情况逐步消失，走上了正规的道路。特别使我们感动的是当匈牙利专家将要离开我站回国的前一天还在孜孜不倦地帮助我们工作。这种亲密的兄弟之情，这种高度的国际主义精神，不仅深深地感动了我们，而且更增强了我们办好站的信心和决心。
    我们站在专家们的积极帮助下虽已取得了很大成绩，但是我个人在领导方面还是缺乏经验的，今后必须继续学习、研究已往学习到的匈牙利农业拖拉机站的先进经验，更好地把它们运用到实际工作中去，把工作做好来答谢匈牙利人民和匈牙利政府对我们的帮助，并永远保持着中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站的荣誉。
    现在，我代表我站全体工作同志谨祝卡达尔总理和全体团员同志身体健康和愉快，并祝中匈两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁。（附图片）
