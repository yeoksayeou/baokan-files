Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 2nd. The newly built leaching workshop of the Qingdao Vegetable Oil Factory officially started trial production yesterday. According to the results of several leaching test productions, the residual oil rate in peanut cake has dropped from about 4% to about 0.5%. In this way, every 100 jin of cake can produce an additional three and a half jin of oil; calculated on the basis of pressing 80 tons of raw rice per day, more than 3,000 jin of oil can be produced. From September to December, with the same amount of raw materials, more than 150 tons of peanut oil can be produced.

The machinery and equipment of this new workshop were all improved and installed by workers and technicians of the factory using old materials in stock and idle old machines. The state only invested 150,000 yuan; this investment can be recovered from profits within half a year.

    用呆滞物料修的车间
    据新华社青岛2日电 青岛植物油厂新建的浸出车间昨天正式试车生产。根据几次浸出试验生产的结果，花生饼中残油率由原来的4％左右下降到0.5％左右。这样，每百斤饼能多出三斤半油；按每天压榨八十吨生米计算，能多出三千多斤油。从9月份到12月份，用同样多的原料，可以多产花生油一百五十多吨。
    这个新车间的机器设备，全部是本厂工人和技术人员利用库存旧料和闲置旧机器经过改进安装的，国家只投资十五万元；这笔投资，半年内就能从利润中收回。
