Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: The Provisional Guidelines for Soil and Water Conservation of the People's Republic of China have been revised and completed by the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Committee and have been approved by the State Council. The formulation and promulgation of these guidelines are aimed at carrying out soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas across the country to achieve the rational utilization of soil and water resources, eradicate river flood hazards, develop river water conservancy, develop agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, and build mountainous areas.

The guidelines stipulate: Steep slopes above 25 degrees are generally prohibited from being reclaimed; soil and water conservation forests, farmland shelterbelts, and forests around reservoirs and along both sides of rivers (within one kilometer) and railways are generally prohibited from being felled; indiscriminate logging is prohibited; deforestation for cultivation is prohibited; road construction, mining, quarrying, earth extraction, and other projects must take necessary soil and water conservation measures and must be under the leadership and inspection of the local soil and water conservation leading organs; sideline production in mountainous areas such as digging medicinal herbs, burning charcoal, and collecting tree fungus must be carried out under leadership and in a planned manner to prevent damage to mountain forests, as well as specific measures such as closing mountains for afforestation and protecting forests from fire.

Regarding the issue of land reclamation, the guidelines stipulate that various localities can determine appropriate prohibited slope degrees based on local soil structure, rainfall and rainfall intensity, and the amount of forest, cultivated land, and population. In the future, any land reclamation by either agricultural cooperatives or individuals must be subject to review by the local soil and water conservation leading organs and approval by the county (or township entrusted by the county) People's Committee. For prohibited slopes that have already been reclaimed, farmers should be mobilized to gradually stop cultivation and plant trees and grass based on increasing the yield of other cultivated land; if it is impossible to stop cultivation due to a large local population and limited land, they should be required to build terraces within a time limit and be responsible for building soil and water conservation field projects and taking corresponding agronomic technical measures. State-owned farms, forest farms, and pastures, and agricultural cooperatives reclaiming state-owned barren mountains and wastelands must be responsible for doing a good job in soil and water conservation work; agricultural tax may be reduced or exempted when profits are low or cultivation is stopped and forests are restored.

The guidelines stipulate that honorary or material rewards will be given to townships, cooperatives, stations, and individuals who have achieved results in soil and water conservation work; educational restraint will be given to acts that damage soil and water conservation, and those with serious circumstances will be punished according to law.

    根治水患　建设山区
    我国水土保持暂行纲要修订完成
    据新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国水土保持暂行纲要，已经由国务院水土保持委员会修订完成，并且已由国务院批准。这个纲要的制定和公布，是为了在全国山区开展水土保持工作，以达到合理利用水土资源，根治河流水害和开发河流水利，发展农林牧业生产和建设山区的目的。
    纲要规定：二十五度以上的陡坡一般禁止开荒；水土保持林、农田防护林以及水库周围、河流两岸（一公里以内）、铁路两侧的树林一般禁止采伐；禁止滥伐林木；禁止毁林开荒；筑路、矿山、采石、采土等工程须做必要的保持水土措施，并须经当地水土保持领导机关的领导和检查；山区挖药材、烧木炭、采木耳等副业生产须有领导有计划地进行，防止破坏山林，以及封山育林、护林防火等等具体措施。
    关于开荒问题，纲要规定各地可根据当地土壤结构、雨量和降雨强度，森林、耕地、人口多少情况规定适宜的禁开坡度。以后无论农业社或个人开荒都须经当地领导水土保持的机关审查和县（或县委托的乡）人民委员会批准。已开了的禁坡，应在增加其他耕地产量的基础上动员农民逐步停耕造林种草；如果当地人多地少无法停耕，就限期修成梯田，并责成其修保持水土的田间工程和采取相应的耕作技术措施。国营农场、林场、牧场和农业社领垦国有荒山荒地，必须负责作好水土保持工作；收益不多或停耕还林时可予减免农业税。
    纲要规定：对于水土保持工作有成绩的乡、社、站和个人，给予荣誉或物质奖励；对于破坏水土保持的行为，予以教育制止，情节严重的要依法惩处。
