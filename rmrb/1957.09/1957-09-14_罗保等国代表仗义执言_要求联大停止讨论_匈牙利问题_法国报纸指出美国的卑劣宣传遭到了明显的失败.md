Xinhua News Agency Report: Romanian and Bulgarian representatives spoke at the United Nations General Assembly special session on the 11th, opposing the discussion of the so-called "Hungarian Question."

The Romanian representative, Magrou, pointed out that this discussion is a crude interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. He said that the Western countries' attempt to discuss the Hungarian question at the United Nations is a destructive act aimed at poisoning the international atmosphere.

The Bulgarian representative, Voutov, pointed out that the UN General Assembly's holding of this discussion violates the UN Charter. The Bulgarian representative concluded by expressing regret at the harmful propaganda campaign carried out by the UN Secretariat, which was centered around the activities of the "Five-Nation Committee" and its fabricated report. It demanded an end to the use of the UN platform for slanderous campaigns against the countries of the socialist camp.

Representatives from the United Kingdom, Peru, Greece, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands also spoke at the meeting on the 11th, all supporting the US position and slandering the Soviet and Hungarian governments.

The UN General Assembly special session continued to discuss the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the 12th in the morning and afternoon.

Under the blatant instigation of American diplomats, representatives of Latin American countries and some other countries continued to slander the Soviet Union and Hungary. However, because this kind of activity was so dirty, the representatives who supported the United States preferred to spend time in the bars opened for the representatives after their speeches, rather than attending the meeting. Most of the representative seats in the meeting hall were empty.

The Cuban representative to the United Nations, Nuñez-Portuondo, and the representative of Franco Spain made lengthy and extremely vicious speeches at the meeting. They repeated the most despicable and absurd fabrications in American propaganda.

The Burmese representative, U Thant, said that Burma "in principle" agreed with the joint proposal of the United States and more than thirty other countries, but he advocated changing the words in the proposal that condemned the Soviet Union to expressing "regret."

The Albanian representative, Malile, refuted the Western slanders in his speech. He emphasized that the reason why the imperialist countries are carrying out provocative clamoring on the "Hungarian Question" is because they want to divert world public attention from the bloody suppression of the national liberation movements in colonial countries and dependencies, and divert their attention from the persecution of the people of Oman and Algeria and the conspiracy against Syria. Malile demanded an end to this discussion.

TASS, Paris, 12th: The United States' despicable propaganda against the People's Republic of Hungary and the Soviet Union launched at the United Nations has suffered an obvious failure. Pierre, the "Le Monde" correspondent in New York, wrote in his report: The United Nations General Assembly continues to debate the Hungarian question "in a boring and indifferent atmosphere."

The reporter pointed out that American public opinion is also not at all interested in the discussion of this question. The visitors' seats in the UN General Assembly hall are empty. People in the General Assembly lounge are no longer talking about the so-called "Hungarian question," but rather about how to spend the holidays.

　　罗保等国代表仗义执言
　　要求联大停止讨论“匈牙利问题”
　　法国报纸指出美国的卑劣宣传遭到了明显的失败
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息：罗马尼亚和保加利亚代表11日在联合国大会特别会议上发言，反对讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”。
    罗马尼亚代表马格鲁指出，这种讨论是对一个主权国家内政的粗暴干涉。他说，西方国家要在联合国讨论匈牙利问题，是一个企图毒化国际气氛的破坏行为。
    保加利亚代表伏托夫指出联合国大会举行这个讨论是违背联合国宪章的。保加利亚代表最后对联合国秘书处围绕“五国委员会”的活动及其捏造的报告而全力进行的有害的宣传运动表示遗憾。它要求停止利用联合国的讲台来进行反对社会主义阵营国家的诽谤运动。
    在11日会议上发言的还有英国、秘鲁、希腊、澳大利亚、新西兰和荷兰等国代表，他们都支持美国的立场，对苏联和匈牙利政府进行污蔑。
    联合国大会特别会议在12日上下午继续讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”。
    拉丁美洲国家和其他一些国家的代表在美国外交家明目张胆的怂恿下，继续对苏联和匈牙利进行诽谤。但是由于这种勾当是这样肮脏，支持美国的代表们在发言后都宁可到为代表们开设的酒吧间里消磨时间，而不愿意参加会议。会议大厅里的代表席位大多数都空着没人坐。
    古巴驻联合国代表努奈斯—波图翁多和佛朗哥西班牙代表在会议上作了冗长和极端恶毒的发言。他们重复了美国宣传中的最卑劣和最荒谬的捏造。
    缅甸代表吴丹说，缅甸“在原则上”赞同美国和其他三十多个国家的联合提案，但是他主张把提案中谴责苏联的字句改为表示“遗憾”。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表马利列在发言中驳斥了西方的谰言。他着重指出，帝国主义国家所以在“匈牙利问题”上进行挑衅性的叫嚷，是因为它们想转移世界公众对血腥镇压殖民地国家和附属国的民族解放运动的注意，转移他们对迫害阿曼和阿尔及利亚人民以及阴谋反对叙利亚的注意。马利列要求停止这个讨论。
    据塔斯社巴黎12日讯：美国在联合国发动的反对匈牙利人民共和国和苏联的卑劣宣传遭到了明显的失败。“世界报”驻纽约记者皮埃尔在报道中写道：联合国大会继续在“无聊和漠不关心的气氛下”辩论着匈牙利问题。
    记者指出，美国舆论界对这个问题的讨论也丝毫不感到兴趣。联合国大会会议厅的旁听席都空着。大会休息室里也都不在谈论所谓“匈牙利问题”，而是谈如何度过假日。
