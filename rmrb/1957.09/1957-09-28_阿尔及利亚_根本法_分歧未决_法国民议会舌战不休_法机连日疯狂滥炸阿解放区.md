    Algerian "Fundamental Law" Dispute Unresolved
    French National Assembly Engaged in Heated Debate
    French Aircraft Bombarded Algerian Liberated Areas Frenetically for Days
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 27th - The French National Assembly began debating the draft of the Algerian "Fundamental Law" on the afternoon of the 25th.
    This draft was transferred to the plenary session of the Assembly for discussion after the Internal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly failed to reach any result after two consecutive days of debate.
    Prior to this, the draft of the "Fundamental Law" had been initially finalized after lengthy consultations between the government and right-wing parties to reconcile differences. The government had convened a "round table conference" composed of seven cabinet ministers and twelve leaders of various right-wing political parties to specifically discuss this issue. The conference amended the contents of the "Fundamental Law" draft and reached a compromise agreement on the 21st.
    The "round table conference" agreement stipulated that the actual powers of the Algerian Federal Council proposed in the draft would only be specified in another bill after local councils were elected in various regions of Algeria eighteen months later. This means that the organizational form and functions of this Algerian administrative body can only be in a "blank" state in the "Fundamental Law." The "round table conference" made this provision in order to temporarily avoid the differences between the political parties on the issue of how much power should be given to this administrative body.
    However, despite this, fierce disputes were rekindled when the draft was submitted to the Internal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly for review. The main disputes at the meeting focused on Article 5 regarding election issues and Article 12 regarding the federal executive body. The Socialists and Popular Republicans among the committee members supported the draft amended by the round table conference; the Independents and Social Republicans tried to give the French Resident Minister in Algeria absolute control; while the Communists and progressives opposed the entire "Fundamental Law," which was intended to beautify but could not solve practical problems, and advocated peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue through negotiations.
    During the parliamentary debate on the 25th, the Communist parliamentary group proposed a motion to postpone the debate on the "Fundamental Law" and suggested that the government hold negotiations with representatives of the Algerian people. However, this motion was rejected by a majority vote.
    The French Cabinet meeting on the 25th authorized French Prime Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury to request a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on the draft agreement of the "round table conference" in order to force the Assembly to adopt the government's draft "Fundamental Law" without modification.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 26th - Algiers News: The French Air Force carried out round-the-clock saturation bombing of the "restricted zone" in the Kolo and El Milia areas of northern Constantine Province on the 25th, in an attempt to eliminate the Algerian National Liberation Army forces in the area's jungles. This is the third time the French Air Force has bombed this area in recent days.
    On the 23rd, French paratrooper units concentrated eight battalions of troops, under the cover of the air force, and surrounded a part of the Algerian rebel forces in the Greater Kabylia Mountains. The fierce battle lasted for twenty-four hours.
    Incidents continue to occur on the Tunisia-Algeria border.

### 阿尔及利亚“根本法”分歧未决  法国民议会舌战不休  法机连日疯狂滥炸阿解放区

    阿尔及利亚“根本法”分歧未决
    法国民议会舌战不休
    法机连日疯狂滥炸阿解放区
    据新华社巴黎电　法国国民议会从25日下午起开始就阿尔及利亚“根本法”草案进行辩论。
    这项草案是在国民议会内政委员会经过连续两天的争论而未能取得任何结果的情况下移交议会全体会议讨论的。
    在这以前，“根本法”草案经过政府同右翼党派进行调和分歧的长时间协商以后本来已经初步确定下来。政府曾经召集了由七名内阁阁员和各右翼政党的十二名领袖参加的“圆桌会议”专门讨论这个问题。这个会议对“根本法”草案内容作了修改，在21日达成了折衷性协议。
    “圆桌会议”的协议规定，草案中提出的阿尔及利亚联邦委员会的实际权力要在阿尔及利亚各区选出地方议会十八个月以后才能在另外制定的法案中加以规定。这就是说，这个阿尔及利亚行政机构的组织形式和职能在“根本法”中只能处于“空白”状态。“圆桌会议”之所以这样规定，是为了暂时避开各政党在给予这个行政机构以多少权力问题上的分歧。
    但是，尽管这样，在草案交到国民议会内政委员会去审议时，重新引起了激烈的争执。会上主要的争论集中在第五条关于选举问题和第十二条关于联邦执行机构的问题。委员中的社会党人和人民共和党人支持圆桌会议所修改的草案；独立党人和社会共和党人力图使法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节部长掌握绝对的控制权；而共产党人和进步人士则反对目的在于粉饰而不能解决实际问题的整个“根本法”，并且主张通过谈判来和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    在25日的议会辩论中，共产党议会党团提出一项提案，要求延期辩论“根本法”，并且建议政府同阿尔及利亚人民的代表举行谈判。但是，这项提案遭到多数票的否决。
    法国内阁会议25日授权法国总理布歇—莫努里要求国民议会就“圆桌会议”协议的草案举行信任投票，以迫使议会不加修改地采纳政府拟定的“根本法”草案。
    据新华社26日讯　阿尔及尔消息：法国空军25日对君士坦丁省北部科洛和埃尔米利亚一带的“禁区”实行了二十四小时的轮番饱和轰炸，企图把这一地区丛林中的阿尔及利亚民族解放军部队消灭。这是法国空军近日以来第三次轰炸这一地区。
    23日，法军伞兵部队集中了八个营的兵力在空军的掩护下，包围了大卡比利亚山区的一部分阿尔及利亚起义部队，激战持续了二十四小时。
    突尼斯—阿尔及利亚边境事件仍然不断发生。
