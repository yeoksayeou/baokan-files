Hegang's Coal Reserves Rank First in Northeast China
　　Annual Output of Seven Million Tons, Can Be Continuously Mined for Over 140 Years
　　(Our newspaper, Hegang, 15th dispatch) Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: Exploration by the Coal Industry Ministry's 109 Geological Exploration Team has proven that the Hegang coalfield has reserves of up to one billion tons, ranking first in the Northeast region.
　　This coalfield stretches along the eastern end of the Lesser Khingan Mountains and connects to the Songhua River Plain, forming a hilly area. The coalfield extends from northeast to southwest, about fifty kilometers long and ten kilometers wide. Since last year, the 109 Geological Exploration Team has been conducting coalfield surveys and general prospecting in a vast area from Tangyuan in the south to Luobei in the north, Yilan in the west to Baoquanling in the east. Based on the most conservative estimates, the coal reserves discovered in Junde, Xingdong, and Shitou Miaozi alone amount to more than 500 million tons. Based on Hegang Coal Mine's production of seven million tons in the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan, the currently found one billion tons of coal reserves can sustain the entire mine for continuous mining for more than 140 years. The coal in the Hegang coalfield is gas-fat coal and gas coal, suitable for industrial power generation and railway transportation. The coal in some areas has strong caking properties and can be used as coking blending coal after testing. The oil content of Hegang coal reaches 8%-10%, and oil can be extracted.
　　The geological team also discovered oil shale in Tieli, on the periphery of the Hegang coalfield.

　　鹤岗煤藏量居东北首位
　　年产七百万吨，可以连续开采一百四十多年
    本报鹤岗15日电  记者康伟中报道：经过煤炭工业部109地质勘探队的勘探证明：鹤岗煤田的蕴藏量达十亿吨，居东北地区的首位。
    这个煤田绵延于小兴安岭的东端，与松花江平原相连，形成丘陵地带。煤田由东北向西南方向发展，长约五十公里，宽十公里。从去年开始，109地质勘探队在南至汤原，北至萝北，西至依兰，东至宝泉岭的广大地区内，进行煤田的查勘和普查工作。以最保守的估计，仅在竣德、兴东，和石头庙子三处发现煤的蕴藏量即达五亿吨以上。按照鹤岗煤矿第二个五年计划最后一年生产七百万吨计算，现已找到的十亿吨煤藏量，可供全矿持续开采一百四十多年。鹤岗煤田的煤是气肥煤和气煤，适合工业发电和铁路运输用。其中有些地方的煤的粘结性强，经过试验可作炼焦配煤。鹤岗煤的含油率达到8％—10％，可以提炼石油。
    地质队还在鹤岗煤田的外围——铁骊地方发现油母页岩。
