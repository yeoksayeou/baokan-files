Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 3rd. Soviet Young Pioneers commemorated the 25th anniversary of the murder of fourteen-year-old Young Pioneer Morozov on September 3rd, who sacrificed himself because of his firm and resolute struggle against the hostile classes.

	Pavlik Morozov was born in a poor peasant family in the Northern Urals. During the period of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, this thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer actively participated in the struggle against the rich peasants. At that time, his father was the chairman of the village soviet, but under the influence of the rich peasants, he degenerated into a traitor, secretly selling false documents to the rich peasants. When Morozov learned of this situation, he angrily reported his father and testified in court. When the rich peasants attempted to sabotage the government's grain purchasing policy, he called on the peasants to hand over grain to the state and pointed out on the spot those who were hiding and damaging grain. Because of these reasons, the rich peasants held a grudge against him. On September 3, 1932, Morozov was killed in the forest by a rich peasant gang. He was only fourteen years old at the time. His eight-year-old brother was also killed at the same time. The murderers were later captured and executed.

	To commemorate this teenager who stood firm and heroically sacrificed himself for the cause of the class, many collective farms, Young Pioneer Palaces, and libraries were named after Morozov. A monument was also erected for him in a children's park in Moscow. In 1954, the people of his hometown also erected a monument for him.

	On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Morozov's death this year, many Young Pioneers sang songs praising this teenager. The Young Pioneers of Moscow paid homage to the Morozov monument on this day and offered flowers. (Attached picture)

    苏联少先队员纪念莫洛佐夫遇害二十五周年
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联少年先锋队员9月3日纪念了因为坚定、并且坚决和敌对阶级作斗争而牺牲的十四岁少先队员莫洛佐夫遇害二十五周年。
    帕夫里克·莫洛佐夫是北乌拉尔人，出生在一个贫农的家庭中。在三十年代苏联农业集体化时期，这位十三岁的少先队员积极地参加了反对富农的斗争。当时，他的父亲担任村苏维埃主席，但是，在富农的影响下却堕落成了叛徒，秘密出卖假文件给富农。当莫洛佐夫知道了这种情形以后，就愤怒地检举了他的父亲，并且出席法庭作证。当富农们企图破坏政府的粮食收购政策的时候，他又号召农民把粮食交给国家，并且当场指出了隐藏和损坏粮食的人。由于这些原因，富农就对他怀恨在心。1932年9月3日，莫洛佐夫被富农匪帮杀死在森林中。那时他只有十四岁。和他同时遇害的还有他的八岁的弟弟。杀害他的凶手事后被捕获枪决了。
    为了纪念这个立场坚定、为阶级事业英勇牺牲的少年，许多集体农庄、少先宫和图书馆都以莫洛佐夫命名，莫斯科一个儿童公园中还为他建立了纪念碑。1954年，他的故乡的群众也为他建立了纪念碑。
    在今年莫洛佐夫遇难二十五周年的时候，许多少先队员唱起了歌颂这个少年的歌曲。莫斯科的少先队员在这天拜谒了莫洛佐夫纪念碑，并且献了鲜花。（附图片）
