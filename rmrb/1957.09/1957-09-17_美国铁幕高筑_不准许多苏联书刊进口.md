Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th—In the United States today, Soviet publications ranging from selected works of Belinsky to the writings of Mark Twain, from calendars to Bibles, are prohibited from being imported. This was stated in an article by Mark Rushenko recently published in the Soviet “Literary Gazette.”

The author said that at the end of 1955, a resident of Yerevan sent an Armenian calendar to a relative living in the United States, but the relative never received it. By July of this year, this calendar was prominently listed in a thick list of prohibited Soviet publications sent by the U.S. postal authorities to the Soviet Union.

The article pointed out that the U.S. postal authorities have already submitted hundreds of lists of this kind of Soviet publications which were sent to the U.S. at the request of private individuals, scientific institutions, churches and companies but were confiscated by the U.S. postal authorities. These lists could be bundled into many large packages. It is especially a strange story that the American-Russian Institute asked the Moscow Patriarchate for a Russian Bible, and this book was also listed as a book "not allowed to circulate in the United States" and was confiscated. "Journal of the Moscow Patriarchate" and the Soviet Baptist "Fraternal Messenger" magazine have also suffered the same fate.

### 美国铁幕高筑  不准许多苏联书刊进口

　　美国铁幕高筑
　　不准许多苏联书刊进口
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　在目前的美国，从别林斯基选集到马克·吐温的著作，从日历到圣经等苏联出版物都被禁止入口，这是苏联“文学报”最近发表的马克鲁申科的一篇文章中说的。
    作者说，1955年底，埃里温的一位居民给他的一位住在美国的亲戚寄了一份亚美尼亚文的日历，然而他那位亲戚却一直没有收到。到今年7月，在美国邮政当局给苏联寄来的厚厚的一本禁止入口的苏联出版物名单中，这部日历也赫然在目了。
    文章指出，像这样一类苏联按照美国私人、科学机构、教堂和公司的要求寄给他们而被美国邮政当局没收的出版物的名单，美国邮政当局已经提出了好几百份，这些名单可以捆成许多大包。尤其成为奇闻的是，美俄研究所向莫斯科主教区要一部俄文本圣经，这部书也被列为“不得在美国流通”的书籍而遭没收，“莫斯科主教区杂志”和苏联浸礼教徒的“兄弟信息”杂志也都遭到了同样的命运。
