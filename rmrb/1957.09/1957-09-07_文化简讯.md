    Research on Minority Folk Literature
    The ranks of those engaged in research and excavation of minority folk literature in Yunnan Province are constantly growing. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 150 literary and art workers from ten ethnic groups, including Han, Dai, Bai, Naxi, and Hani, participating in this work throughout the province.
    With the deep involvement of a large number of literary and art workers, many new works have been appearing in newspapers and periodicals.
    Ethnic literature groups, ethnic folk literature research associations, or "Zanha" friendship associations distributed in ethnic areas throughout the province have generally received attention and support from local governments. (Xinhua News Agency)
    First Batch of Tibetan Primary School Teachers
    A group of Tibetan youths recently graduated from the teacher training class attached to Lhasa Middle School. They are the first batch of Tibetan teachers trained locally. Now, these young teachers are preparing to go to work in rural and pastoral primary schools in Changdu, Shannan, Heihe and other regions.
    This teacher training class was opened last summer, and the students studied basic courses such as Tibetan grammar, arithmetic, natural science, and education. At the graduation farewell party, they expressed their dedication to the educational cause of their ethnic group. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Taohuawu Woodcut New Year Pictures to be Produced
    Although Suzhou Taohuawu woodcut New Year pictures once enjoyed a reputation equal to that of Tianjin Yangliuqing New Year pictures in Chinese history, they have been on the verge of extinction in the past two decades. After two meetings, the provincial and municipal cultural bureaus decided to retrain talents in this field, and decided that Xinhua Bookstore would assist in promoting these woodcut New Year pictures. The person in charge of Xinhua Bookstore and the painters have jointly selected 46 of the better New Year pictures from the existing 237 Taohuawu woodcut New Year pictures as promotional varieties. Among them are various opera excerpts loved and familiar to people, such as "Farewell My Concubine," "Wu Song Fights the Tiger," "Happy Forest," "Dian Qiuxiang," and so on. There are also pictures loved by farmers such as "Golden Rooster Announces Dawn" and "Silkworm Cat Urges Rats."
    Li Hong's New Work "Fifteen Strings of Cash" Completed
    Writer Li Hong recently finished organizing the "Fifteen Strings of Cash" he wrote last autumn.
    Li Hong's "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is a full-length novel in chapters and sections of about 150,000 to 160,000 words, focusing on the depiction of three typical characters: Kuang Zhong, Guo Yuzhi, and Lou Arshu. Li Hong lived in the Jiangnan area for a long time and is very familiar with the customs and language of the location where the story takes place. He also conducted a fairly detailed study of the judicial system at that time.

    云南省从事民族民间文学研究和发掘整理工作的队伍，正在不断壮大。据不完全统计，目前全省已经有汉族、傣族、白族、纳西族、哈尼族等十个民族的文艺工作者一百五十多人参加了这项工作。
    随着大批文艺工作者的深入，许多新的作品已陆续在报刊上出现。

    一批藏族青年最近从拉萨中学附设的师资训练班毕业，他们是在当地培养出的第一批藏族教师。现在，这些青年教师们正准备分赴昌都、山南、黑河等地区的乡村和牧区小学去工作。
    这个师资训练班是去年夏天开办的，学员们在这里学习了藏文文法、算术、自然科学、教育学等基本课程。毕业欢送会上他们表示要献身于本民族的教育事业。（据新华社讯）
    桃花坞木刻年画将生产
    苏州桃花坞木刻年画，虽然在我国历史上曾经和天津杨柳青的年画并负盛名，但近二十年来，已趋于人亡艺绝的境地。省市文化局经过两次会议研究，确定重新培养这方面的人才，并决定由新华书店协助推销这种木刻年画。新华书店负责人和画家们已一起从现有的二百三十七幅桃花坞木刻年画中，挑选出了较好的四十六幅年画作为推销品种。其中有人们喜爱和熟悉的各种戏文，如“霸王别姬”、“武松打虎”、“快活林”、“点秋香”等等。还有农民们喜爱的“锦鸡报晓”、“蚕猫迫鼠”等图片。
    李红新作“十五贯”脱稿
    作家李红最近把去年秋天所写的“十五贯”整理完毕。
    李红的“十五贯”是一部十五、六万字的长篇章回体小说，着重描写了况钟、过于执、娄阿鼠这三个典型形象。李红曾长期寄居江南一带，对故事发生地点的风俗、语言都极熟悉。他对当时的司法制度也作了相当详细的考证。
