At the Construction Site of the Datong Locomotive Factory
　　Gu Ye (text)　Guo Luansheng (photography)

　　On a large piece of land near the southwest of the ancient city of Datong, bordering villages and groves, cranes with long arms are using heavy hammers to tamp the factory foundation up and down; heavy bulldozers and scrapers are shuttling back and forth, leveling the ground. Above the land, there is always a wisp of soaring yellow dust stirred up by the construction machinery.

　　"Look! What kind of factory will we build here!" Yang Bingqian and Guo Renlun, two old men who have been foundry workers for half their lives, are radiant with vigor as they study the blueprints and introduce the situation to me. "This is the Datong Locomotive Factory, which broke ground on August 15th. When the first phase of the project is put into production in 1960, it will be able to produce 400 new types of steam freight locomotives and coal-water tenders every year."

　　在大同机车厂的工地上
　　顾页  著文　郭滦生  摄影
    在大同古城西南面附近一大片紧挨着村落和树丛的土地上，伸着长臂的吊车，正在用重锤一上一下地夯实厂房地基；笨重的推土机和铲运机，正在穿梭般平整地面。土地的上空，终日笼罩着施工机械掀起的一缕缕的冲天黄尘。
    “你看！我们将在这里建设一座怎样的工厂啊！”杨秉乾和郭仁伦这两个干过半辈子翻砂工的老人，容光焕发地一边研究图纸，一边给我介绍情况。“这便是8月15日破土动工兴建的大同机车厂。到1960年第一期工程投入生产后，每年就能生产四百台新型的蒸汽货运机车和煤水车。”
