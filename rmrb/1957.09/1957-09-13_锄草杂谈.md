Random Jottings on Weeding

    The Rightists' "Capital" Theory

    The right-wing writer Ding Ling uses writing a book as "capital." The right-wing director Bai Chen uses making a film as "capital." The right-wing actor Xiang Kun wants to actively join the Party to strive for greater "capital." Luo and Zhang use not paying league fees, not writing autobiographies, and not participating in organizational life as "capital" for great development.

    Chen Renbing said to Wu Yin: "You participated in the Central Propaganda Conference, you now have 'capital,' and you can speak out more freely and boldly."

    Bai Chen also said to another director: "You can't speak, because you don't have 'capital' yet. I have 'Southern Island Storm,' so I can speak."

    This is the right-wingers' "capital" theory. They always pretend to be active and progressive to seize "capital," and then use this "capital" to frantically and viciously attack the Party. But we want to tell the right-wingers that your "capital" will definitely be eroded away.

    Unreliable Posterity

    The right-wing elements' words and deeds against the Party and socialism are of course unacceptable to the people. Therefore, they pin their hopes on the future, saying something like "history will judge in a few hundred years," or that his works should be "hidden in famous mountains and passed down to posterity."

    The future will certainly be different from today, and the next generation will never be the same as the previous generation forever. For example, Yun Yinglin's son is exposing his father's conspiracy to make a false self-criticism. This kind of example is not just one.

    However, unfortunately, sons are mostly more progressive than their fathers, and sons' sons are even more so. This is a reflection of the times. Putting hope in the future and hoping that history will go backward is just a helpless fantasy. ·Liu Muru·

　　Distinguishing Right from Wrong

    The struggle against the right-wingers is to distinguish between major rights and wrongs. We must, of course, mercilessly expose the ugly behavior of the right-wing elements against the Party and socialism. At the same time, we must also distinguish between right and wrong in drawing a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements. Major rights and wrongs must be clearly distinguished, but this is not easy.

    Mr. Lu Xun opposed Zhuangzi's lack of a fixed view of right and wrong; he wrote in "Resurrection": "Clothes are dispensable... Birds have feathers, beasts have fur, but cucumbers and eggplants are stark naked. This is what is meant by 'that is also a right and wrong, this is also a right and wrong.'" ("Old Tales Retold") Why add such a sharp satire? Because Zhuangzi's argument confused right and wrong.

    Chairman Mao pointed out in "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" when explaining "It's terrible" and "It's fine," "'It's terrible' is clearly a theory that stands on the side of the landlords' interests to attack the peasant uprising, and 'It's fine' is the theory of the peasants and other revolutionary factions." In the struggle against the right-wingers, we must cultivate this ability to distinguish between "terrible" and "fine."

    右派的“资本”论
    右派作家丁玲以写出一本书作为“资本”。右派导演白沉以拍出一部电影作为“资本”。右派演员项堃想积极打入党，争取更大的“资本”。罗、章是以不要交盟费，不要写自传，不用过组织生活来大发展作“资本”。
    陈仁炳对吴茵说：“你参加了中央宣传会议，你现在有了‘资本’，更可以大放大鸣了。”
    白沉也对另一位导演说：“你不能说话，因为你还没有‘资本’，我有一部‘南岛风云’，可以说话。”
    这就是右派分子的“资本”论。他们总是先伪装积极、进步来摄取“资本”，然后以这些“资本”来猖狂毒辣地向党进攻。可是我们要告诉右派分子，你们的这些“资本”，肯定都是要蚀光的。
                      ·尚义·
    靠不住的后世
    右派分子反党反社会主义的言行，在人民中当然是通不过的，于是，他们就寄希望于将来，说什么是“几百年之后自有定论”，说什么他的著作要“藏之名山，传之后世”。
    后世和今天当然会有所不同，下一代决不会和上一代永远一样，例如云应霖的儿子不是就在揭发乃父做假检讨的阴谋么。这种例子，不止一个。
    然而可惜的是，儿子大多要比老子进步些，儿子的儿子则更是，这是时代的反映。寄希望于将来，希望历史开倒车，只是无可如何的一种幻想而已。·刘穆如·
　　辨是非
    反右派斗争是要辨明大是大非的。我们固然要毫不留情地揭发右派分子反党反社会主义的丑恶行为，同时也要在和右派分子划清界线中辨明是非。大是大非必须辨别清楚，可是这也并不容易。
    鲁迅先生反对庄子无一定的是非之见；他在“起死”上写道：“衣服是可有可无的……鸟有羽，兽有毛，然而黄瓜、茄子赤条条。此所谓‘彼亦一是非，此亦一是非。’”（“故事新编”）为什么要加以这样尖锐的讽刺呢？因为庄子的论点混淆了是非。
    毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”上解释“糟得很”和“好得很”时指出，“糟得很”，明明是站在地主利益方面打击农民起来的理论，“好得很”是农民及其他革命派的理论。反右派斗争中，我们要锻炼这种分辨“糟”和“好”的能力。
