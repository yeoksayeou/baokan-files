Comrades and friends,

	On behalf of the delegation of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia, the delegation of the Central People's Committee of the City of Prague, and Comrade Svoboda, the Mayor of Prague, I sincerely thank you for such a warm welcome.

	I believe it is my duty to convey the sincere respect of the Czechoslovak people, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and the National Front to you.

	The Czechoslovak people have always held deep sympathy for the Chinese people, and have watched with respect and admiration the Chinese people's heroic struggle against colonial oppression and imperialist aggression against China, especially the heroic struggle against Japanese imperialist aggression. Only the people's movement represented by the Communist Party of China and led by our great friend Comrade Mao Zedong could unite all patriotic forces and complete the great revolutionary cause of national liberation and national rebirth.

	Since then, the Chinese people have moved forward by leaps and bounds at an unprecedented pace, successfully eliminating the shortcomings left over from colonial rule and long-term war in a way that is in line with their thousands of years of tradition, and solving their own problems according to China's conditions. People's China has thus become a powerful pillar of peace, a powerful pillar of the socialist camp, and an unshakable warrior for peace.

	Not long ago, the delegation of the National People's Congress headed by Comrade Peng Zhen visited Czechoslovakia. During the visit, the delegation personally experienced the deep friendship of the Czechoslovak people towards the Chinese people. Whether in factories, rural areas, or mines, the delegation was warmly welcomed everywhere and left a deep impression. Our people still remember the wonderful moments spent with the delegation of the National People's Congress of China.

	The visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress to Czechoslovakia and the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China have greatly consolidated the friendship between the two countries, and we will further develop and consolidate this friendship.

	What connects us is the ideal of the Great October Revolution, which was born forty years ago. We will further realize this ideal.

	Dear comrades, I can assure you, on behalf of the Czechoslovak people, that we will always be loyal to this ideal and continue to stand unswervingly on the western front of the socialist camp, defending the security of the socialist camp and world peace.

	Finally, please allow me to shout in Chinese: Long live People's China!

    费林格主席的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我代表捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团、布拉格市中央人民委员会代表团和布拉格市长斯沃波达同志，衷心感谢你们这样热烈的欢迎。
    我认为我有责任把捷克斯洛伐克人民、捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、民族阵线的衷心的敬意转达给你们。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民从来就对中国人民怀着深切的同情，以尊敬羡慕的心情注视着中国人民英勇地反对殖民压迫、反对帝国主义侵略中国的斗争，特别是反对日本帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争。只有以中国共产党为代表的，以我们伟大的朋友毛泽东同志领导的人民运动，才能把一切爱国力量团结统一起来，完成民族解放和国家新生的伟大革命事业。
    自那时以来，中国人民以空前未有的步伐大步前进，用符合自己几千年传统的方式，顺利地消灭殖民统治和长期战争遗留的缺点，根据中国的条件来解决自己的问题。人民中国就这样成为维护和平的强大支柱、成为社会主义阵营的强大支柱和不可动摇的和平战士。
    不久以前，以彭真同志为首的全国人民代表大会代表团访问了捷克斯洛伐克。代表团在访问中亲身体会到捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。不管是在工厂、农村、矿山，代表团到处受到了热烈欢迎，留下了深刻的印象。我们的人民至今还回忆着同中国全国人民代表大会代表团共同度过的美好的时刻。
    全国人民代表大会代表团的访问捷克斯洛伐克，捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的访问中国，大大地巩固了两国之间的友谊，我们还要把这个友谊进一步发展巩固下去。
    把我们联系在一起的是在四十年前诞生的伟大十月革命的理想。我们将进一步实现这个理想。
    亲爱的同志们，我可以向你们保证，代表捷克斯洛伐克人民保证，我们永远忠于这个理想，继续毫不动摇地站在社会主义阵营的西方前线，保卫社会主义阵营的安全和世界和平。
    最后，请让我用中国话高呼：人民中国万岁！
