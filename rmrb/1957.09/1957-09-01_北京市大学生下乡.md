    Beijing University Students Go to the Countryside

    (Our Dispatch) From August 20th to 27th, the majority of the Beijing Normal University students and teachers, totaling 300 people, who remained on campus during the summer vacation, went to the Xishan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the western suburbs to perform a week of voluntary labor and have now returned to campus victoriously.

    At the foot of the beautiful Western Hills, teams of girls and young men were engaged in various kinds of agricultural labor, such as thinning seedlings, weeding, digging sweet potatoes, collecting green manure, and picking prickly ash peppers. Although their work was not very skilled and their efficiency was not very high, the quality met general requirements with the patient and meticulous help of the farmers. Their attitude of humbly learning and working conscientiously was often praised by the cooperative members. Although their backs ached, their legs were numb, their hands were blistered, and their backs were sunburned, they said: This is precisely a test for us, a good opportunity for labor training. One student said: We eat every day, but all we see is white flour, rice, and Chinese cabbage, and we don't know how they come about. Through these short days of labor, a new world of labor has opened up for me, and I have understood a most ordinary truth: every grain of rice and every bowl of porridge does not come easily.

    Everyone also conducted interviews in the evenings and on rainy days. Since its establishment, this cooperative has increased its income year by year. In 1956, the average income per household was 460 yuan, and the standard of living was not much different from that of the city. Through the interviews, everyone saw the rural life with their own eyes, which powerfully refuted the right-wingers' slanders against agricultural cooperativization. (Guo Dingda)

    (Another Dispatch) Recently, the Tsinghua University Student Union organized more than 300 students to go to Xiaotun Township Cooperative and Huangtugang Cooperative in Fengtai District to engage in three days of physical labor with the farmers.

    Every day at 5:30 in the morning, they dispersed into various production teams and worked in the fields with the villagers, harvesting old corn, weeding, pulling radishes, carrying Chinese cabbage... The scorching sun, the persistent labor of bending over, and the cut hands all became their tests and living teaching materials.

    In the evenings, they visited farmers and participated in forums and debates. Here, they saw with their own eyes the thriving scene of the new socialist countryside, the unprecedented improvement of the socialist consciousness of the vast number of peasants, and the sharp class struggle in the rural social reform. All this gave the students a vivid lesson in socialism. (Shen Hengzi, Feng Naiqian)

    (Another Dispatch) Students who remained at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics during the summer vacation enthusiastically participated in on-campus labor.

    From August 12th to 22nd, more than 900 people participated in the work of digging and carrying earth at the student dormitory construction site on campus. This labor was basically voluntary, but in order to enable students to receive a certain amount of remuneration in their labor, the school issued a portion of temporary wages, of which 30% was regarded as the value created for the country in the labor, and 70% was used by the student union as subsidies for students' study, life, food, and major beneficial activities during the vacation. After receiving this subsidy, students with relatively difficult family finances could no longer receive student aid. This not only saved the country's expenses but also implemented the spirit of diligence and frugality in study.

    北京市大学生下乡
    本报讯  8月20日至27日，北京师范大学暑期留校的大部分同学和教师三百人，到西郊西山农业生产合作社进行了一个星期的义务劳动，现在已经胜利返校了。
    在美丽的西山脚下，一队队的姑娘们和小伙子们，进行着间苗、除草、刨白薯、集绿肥和摘蓁椒等多种多样的农业劳动。虽然他们干活很不熟练，工作效率也不太高，但是在农民耐心细致地帮助下，质量达到了一般要求。他们虚心学习和认真劳动的态度也时常受到社员们的夸奖。虽然他们腰弯得发痛，腿蹲得麻木，两手磨出了血泡，背上晒脱了皮，但是他们说：这正是对我们的考验，是劳动锻炼的好机会。一位同学说：我们天天都要吃饭，但一看见就是白面、大米、大白菜，不知道它们是怎样来的。通过这短短的几天劳动，给我打开了一个新的劳动世界，懂得了一个最平常的道理：一粥一饭来处不易。
    大家在晚上和下雨天还进行了访问。这个社从成立以来年年增加收入，1956年平均每户收入四百六十元，生活水平不比城市差多少。通过访问，大家亲眼看到的农村生活，有力地驳斥了右派分子对农业合作化的诽谤。 （郭定达）
    又讯  最近，清华大学学生会组织了三百多同学，分别到丰台区小屯乡社和黄土岗社与农民一起进行了三天体力劳动。
    每天清晨五点半钟，他们就分散在各个生产队里和老乡们一起下地干活了，和社员们一样收割老玉米、锄草、拔萝卜、背白菜……。炽热的太阳，弯腰曲背的持久劳动，割破了的手，这一切都成了他们的考验与活的教材。
    晚上，他们访问了农民，参加了座谈会、辩论会。在这里他们亲眼看见了社会主义新农村的一片繁荣景象，看见了广大农民社会主义觉悟的空前提高，看见了农村社会改革中的尖锐的阶级斗争。这一切给广大同学上了生动的社会主义一课。 （沈恒滋，冯乃谦）
    又讯  北京航空学院暑假中留校的学生，踊跃地参加了校内劳动。
    从8月12日起到22日止，有九百多人参加了校内学生宿舍工地挖土抬土的工作。这一劳动基本上是义务劳动，但是，学校为了使学生在劳动中能得到一定的报酬，发了一部分临时工资，其中30％作为劳动中给国家创造的价值，70％由学生会作为学生学习、生活、伙食和假期中重大有益活动的补助费用，使家庭经济比较困难的学生，领取了这个补助后，就可不再领助学金。这样既节省了国家的开支，也贯彻了勤工俭学的精神。
