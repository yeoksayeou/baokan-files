　　To Lead the Debate Well, Cadre Thoughts Must First Clash
　　Refute Erroneous Arguments and Unify Ideological Understanding
　　Anhui's Four-Level Cadre Grand Debate Concludes

　　(Our Correspondent Yu Ming) The Anhui Province Four-Level Cadre Conference has concluded. This conference held a grand debate on issues such as the unified purchase and sale of grain. Leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government in the province cited numerous facts to prove the correctness of the Party and the state's fundamental policies, and patiently persuaded comrades with erroneous ideas. In addition to verbal debate, visits to factories and screenings of films about national construction were used as auxiliary education, making the conference lively, vigorous, and persuasive.

　　On the issue of unified purchase and sale, some people with incorrect understanding believed that implementing unified purchase and sale meant "only caring about national industrial construction and not caring about farmers' lives," while others believed that the grain purchase tasks were too large, the farmers' food ration standards were too low, and it was difficult to complete the tasks. These people all said that the grain problem was not an ideological problem, and that they could not understand it if it was treated as an ideological problem.

　　The vast majority of comrades disagreed with these statements and refuted them with facts. Anhui is a region that frequently suffers from disasters, and cadres have a deep understanding of the benefits of the state controlling grain. Comrades from the Fuyang Special District in northern Anhui pointed out that this region had experienced disasters in six out of the eight years since liberation. From 1950 to 1956, the state transferred in ten billion jin more grain than it transferred out to supply the farmers and support production. Last year, the Bengbu Special District only purchased ten billion jin of grain, but supplied fourteen billion jin. Cadres from the Wuhu and Anqing Special Districts also cited the situation along the Yangtze River when it was flooded in 1954. At that time, the state transferred in large quantities of grain from Sichuan, and the freight cost of one jin of rice was several times higher than the price of the rice itself, but the state still supplied it at the general rice price, enabling the masses to overcome the disaster. The masses said, "We have rice to eat without harvesting grain, and coal to burn without firewood." If it weren't for unified purchase and sale, could the state have supplied so much grain?

　　Everyone pointed out that national industrial construction and the improvement of farmers' lives are inseparable. The Fuyang Prefectural Committee calculated that the grain and money the state provided for relief and loans to the entire special district in just the first three disaster years was enough to buy tractors to mechanize all the farmland in the district. Comrades from the Lu'an Prefectural Committee said that last year's agricultural loans alone in the entire special district were worth 20% more than the value of all the public grain collected in the district. During the debate, some people also said that if the investment used to harness the Huai River was included, the state's care for the farmers of Anhui would be even more difficult to calculate. These facts prove that the state is not only concerned with industrial construction and not with farmers' lives. On the other hand, it is precisely because the state has industrial construction that it can vigorously support agricultural production.

　　The erroneous idea of not being prepared to complete the grain purchase tasks, using the excuse that the grain purchase tasks are too large and the farmers' food ration standards are too low, was also criticized in the debate. Landlords, rich peasants, and some wealthy middle peasants clamored that "large mouths and small mouths need to eat an average of three shi and six dou (approximately 1000 jin) per year." Three shi and six dou is equal to 1,000 jin of rice, or 720 jin of polished rice. Taking the increased grain yield of Jinzhai, Huoshan, and Shucheng counties in the Lu'an Special District, each person only produces an average of just over 600 jin of grain each year (including seeds and feed). If everyone eats 720 jin of grain, where will the state find the grain to fill this gap? In fact, farmers' food ration standards are much higher than before liberation. According to a survey, before liberation, poor peasants in the Anle Cooperative in Feidong County ate 258 jin of grain, and the average annual grain consumption of poor and middle peasants was only 280 to 300 jin. Now the food ration is 480 jin. Hu Jiabi, a poor peasant in the Foziling Cooperative in Huoshan County, had a family of eight who only ate more than 1,900 jin of grain per year before liberation. Now their food ration has reached 3,800 jin, a two-fold increase.

　　So, if the food ration is not low and the output has increased, why do some people think that the task is large and cannot be completed? Everyone believes that the main reason is that these people have departmentalism and individualism. They listed facts as proof. A county party secretary in Shouxian County was assigned a grain purchase task of 2.7 million jin for his district by his superiors, but he only allocated 1.5 million jin to the lower levels. However, during the few days he attended a meeting in Hefei, 1.8 million jin of grain had already been put into storage in the district. A county party secretary in Lingbi County insisted that Magou Township in his district could only complete 150,000 jin of grain purchase tasks, but the agricultural cooperatives themselves reported that they had reached 200,000 jin; after socialist education, the masses sold 500,000 jin of grain. These facts educated everyone and made them sincerely admit that the grain problem is indeed an ideological problem.

　　At the meeting, everyone also debated whether agricultural cooperativization had advantages, whether farmers' lives had improved, and the relationship between workers and peasants. Through the debate, the ideological awareness of the people attending the meeting has been greatly improved.

　　要把辩论领导好，干部思想先交锋
　　驳倒错误言论统一思想认识
　　安徽四级干部大辩论会结束
    本报讯　记者于明报道：安徽省四级干部会议已经结束了。这次会议对于粮食统购统销等问题进行了大辩论。全省各级党政主要负责干部，在这里举出无数事实，证明了党和国家根本政策的正确性，耐心地说服有错误思想的同志。除了口头辩论，还以参观工厂、看祖国建设的影片作为辅助教育，使会议进行得生动活泼，富有说服力。
    在统购统销问题上，持有错误认识的人，有的认为实行统购统销是“只顾国家工业建设不顾农民生活”，有的则认为统购任务大，农民口粮标准低，完成任务有困难。这些人都说粮食问题不是思想问题，说是思想问题就想不通。
    绝大多数同志不同意这些言论，用事实对他们进行了批驳。安徽是经常遭灾的地区，对国家掌握了粮食的好处，干部有切身的体会。淮北阜阳专区的同志们指出，这个地区解放八年就六年有灾，全区从1950年到1956年，调进调出粮食相抵，国家还多调进十亿斤粮食供应了农民，支持了生产。蚌埠专区去年全区征购的粮食只十亿斤，但供应的却有十四亿斤。芜湖专区、安庆专区的干部们也举出了长江沿岸在1954年遭水灾时的情况作了说明。那时国家从四川调来大量粮食，一斤大米的运费比米价高好几倍，但国家还是按一般米价供应，使群众度过了灾荒。群众说：“没有收粮吃米饭，没有柴烧有煤炭。”要不是统购统销，国家能有这样多粮食供应吗？
    大家指出，国家工业建设和农民的生活改善是分不开的。阜阳地委算了一笔账，光是前三个灾年国家对全专区救济和贷放的粮款，就足够买使全区耕作机械化的拖拉机了。六安地委的同志说，全专区去年只农业贷款，就比全区所征公粮折价还多20％。辩论中有人还说，如果把治理淮河所用的投资算进去，国家对安徽农民的照顾，那就更难计算了。这些事实证明，国家不是只顾工业建设而不顾农民生活。从另一方面看，国家正因为有了工业建设，才能够大力支援农业生产。
    对于借口统购任务大，农民口粮标准低，而不准备完成征购任务的错误思想，在辩论中也进行了批判。地主、富农和一些富裕中农叫嚷着“大口小口每年平均要吃三石六斗”。三石六斗合一千斤稻子，或七百二十斤大米。拿六安专区金寨、霍山、舒城等县已经提高了的粮食产量来算，每年每人平均粮食才不过六百多斤（种籽、饲料在内）。要是都吃七百二十斤粮，国家从哪里找粮食来补这个空？事实上，农民的口粮标准已比解放前提高很多了。据调查，肥东县安乐社解放前贫农吃粮二百五十八斤，贫、中农平均每年吃粮也只有二百八十斤到三百斤。而现在口粮却是四百八十斤。霍山县佛子岭社一个贫农胡家璧，全家八口人，解放前每年只吃粮一千九百多斤，现在的口粮却达到三千八百斤，提高了一倍。
    那末，口粮既不低，产量又增加了，有些人却认为任务大，完不成，究竟是什么原因呢？大家认为主要是这些人有本位主义、个人主义思想，并列举事实作了证明。寿县一个区委书记，上级分配他所在区的征购任务是二百七十万斤，他向下面却只分配一百五十万斤，可是他到合肥开会的几天当中，全区入库粮食已有一百八十万斤了。灵壁县的一个区委书记，硬说该区马沟乡只能完成十五万斤的征购任务，可是这个乡各农业社自报的就达到了二十万斤；经过社会主义教育，群众卖粮又达到了五十万斤。这些事实教育了大家，使大家心悦诚服地承认：粮食问题的确是个思想问题。
    在会上，大家还对农业合作化有没有优越性、农民生活是否提高了，以及工农关系等问题进行了辩论。经过辩论，参加会议的人思想觉悟都有很大提高。
