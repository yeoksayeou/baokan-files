Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram, Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Haijin reports: Literary and art workers in Hunan Province and Changsha City have greatly improved their awareness in the anti-Rightist struggle, and the garden of literature and art is blooming even more vigorously.

　　State-owned theater troupes were previously the focus of attack by the "literary salon" of the provincial China Democratic League Rightist headquarters. Now, in the anti-Rightist struggle, many new atmospheres have emerged. Rightists in the Provincial Drama Troupe, such as director Xiong Bingxun, once claimed that the troupe could not perform without them. After the launch of the anti-Rightist struggle, the drama troupe not only performed without the participation of Rightists, but also performed more, better, and at a lower cost than in the past. The recently staged drama "On the Other Side" is very popular among audiences. Currently, the performance income of the Provincial Drama Troupe is nearly double that of the entire year last year.

　　The Provincial Opera Troupe had achieved little in the past few years. This year, the higher authorities decided to change it to a Huaguxi Opera Troupe, with the aim of improving Hunan Huaguxi Opera, a local opera that is popular among the masses and can reflect real life. However, this decision was met with all kinds of obstruction from Rightists inside and outside the opera troupe. After the anti-Rightist struggle began, the masses brightened their eyes and resolutely decided to run the Huaguxi Opera Troupe well. Their Huaguxi Opera performances in Wuhan, Wuxi, Shanghai and other places were very popular among audiences and were praised as "a flower by the Dongting Lake" in Shanghai. In the past few years, the Provincial Folk Song and Dance Troupe had only one or two evening programs, but now it has four or five evening programs.

　　The Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles is also making progress after exposing the Rightists headed by Wei Mengke, the director of the Federation. The fine arts cause, which was attacked by the Rightists as "not prosperous," held an unprecedented and rich provincial art exhibition in August, with nearly 10,000 authors participating in the exhibition. During the twenty-day exhibition period, there were more than 100,000 visitors.

　　In the past, during the period when Chen Yuxin, the "literary salon" strategist, was in charge of the Provincial Cultural Relics Work Committee, more than one million books in Hunan Province were not sorted out, and Chen Yuxin turned around and used this to attack the Party. Now, after the book staff fought back against the Rightists, their enthusiasm has been greatly improved, and they are striving to sort out all these books by the end of next year.

### 湖南文艺界在反右派斗争中觉悟提高　文苑百花更加盛放

　　湖南文艺界在反右派斗争中觉悟提高
　　文苑百花更加盛放
    据新华社长沙电  新华社记者刘海金报道：湖南省和长沙市文艺工作者在反右派斗争中觉悟大大提高，文苑百花更加盛放。
    各国营剧团过去是这个省民盟右派参谋部“文艺沙龙”的进攻重点，现在在反右派斗争中出现了许多新气象。省话剧团右派分子、导演熊炳勋等过去曾扬言说，剧团离开了他们便无法演出，反右派斗争展开后，在没有右派分子参加的情况下，话剧团不仅演出了，而且比过去演得多、演得好、成本低。近来上演的话剧“在那一边”，就深受观众欢迎。目前省话剧团演出收入已经比去年全年还多出近一倍。
    省歌剧团过去几年成就较小，今年上级决定改为花鼓戏剧团，目的是要把深受群众欢迎、能反映现实生活的地方歌剧——湖南花鼓戏加以提高。但是这一决定曾受到歌剧团内外右派分子的百般阻挠。反右派斗争开始后，群众眼睛擦亮了，坚决要把花鼓戏剧团办好。他们在武汉、无锡、上海等地上演的花鼓戏，深受观众欢迎，在上海被誉为“洞庭湖边的一支花朵”。省民间歌舞剧团过去几年只有一两个晚会的节目，目前已有四、五个晚会的节目了。
    省文联在揭露了以文联主任魏猛克为首的右派分子后，也在前进。被右派分子攻击为“不繁荣”的美术事业，8月份举行了一个空前未有的、丰富多采的全省美术展览会，参加这次展览的作者近万人。在二十天的展览期间，观众达十多万人。
    省文物工作委员会过去在“文艺沙龙”军师陈浴新把持期间，湖南省有一百多万册图书没有清理，而陈浴新反过来以此向党进攻。现在，图书工作人员反击右派分子以后，积极性大大提高，他们争取在明年底把这些图书全部清理好。
