Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: Women representatives emphasized at the Third National Women's Congress of China held today that women's contributions in managing household affairs will play a huge role in socialist construction. Especially in sideline production and food conservation, the potential of the broad masses of women is unlimited.

Many representatives used concrete examples at the meeting to illustrate the significant relationship between individuals, families, and the country. Xiong Tianjing, Director of the Rural Relief Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said at the meeting that the family is a constituent cell of the country and society. Under the socialist system, the country, the collective, the family, and the individual are inextricably linked, sharing consistent fundamental interests. The prosperity and strength of the country depend on the hard work of every family and individual. Xiong Tianjing said that some people believe: housework is lowly, only productive labor is glorious; others say that managing housework is unpromising, and only participating in social work has a future. She criticized this idea of ​​belittling housework, and she asked every family and individual to contribute to national construction through practicing diligence and thrift.

Wen Guizhi, Deputy Director of the Women's Federation of Changwei Special District, Shandong Province, said at the meeting that due to the education of women in diligence and thrift for national construction and diligence and thrift in managing their homes over the past year, women have made significant achievements in pig raising. In Yidu County of this special district, from July last year to August this year, the number of pigs raised increased from 40,000 to more than 73,000. The development of women's pig-raising endeavors not only directly promoted agricultural production but also greatly increased the income of commune members' families. According to a survey in Changwei Special District, some places have increased grain production by 18 jin per mu of land due to the increased application of pig manure, and the income from pig raising accounts for more than 20% of the total income from household agricultural and sideline production. Wu Guang, Director of the Women's Federation of Anhui Province, also emphasized the significant role of women in this regard at the meeting. She said that there are now more than 7 million pigs raised throughout Anhui Province. If women work harder and raise an average of two pigs per household, each household can increase its income by 60 to 80 yuan, and the province can supply the country with 3 million more fat pigs. Every bit of contribution from each household is a major support to the country.

When representatives talked about food conservation, they said that women are the "directors of the family granary," and food conservation mainly relies on women. In mobilizing women to save food in Changwei Special District, Shandong Province, the focus was on plugging loopholes in waste and rational use. After careful calculation and improvement of life management, many farmers not only have enough food to eat but also have a surplus. This special district once estimated based on the grain consumption plan of the head of a township women's representative meeting that if each household saves four liang of grain per day, the entire special district would have the confidence to save more than 130 million jin of grain in a year. Zhang Zhuxiang, Deputy Director of the Sanjie Township Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangchuan County, Yunnan Province, said that in order to save food in every possible way, our cooperative launched the "one person, one trick" movement, and one cooperative saved more than 1.8 million jin of grain for the country in a year.

The meeting emphasized that organizing women to participate in various sideline productions is an important aspect of diligence and thrift in managing the home. Xiong Tianjing said that in Anci County, Hebei Province, during the tense spring famine in February this year, more than 10,000 women were mobilized to participate in sideline production, and sufficient male labor was extracted to participate in agricultural production, which not only ensured the smooth progress of preparatory work for plowing but also obtained more than 99,000 yuan in sideline income, successfully overcoming the spring famine. Zhang Zhuxiang, Deputy Director of the Sanjie Township Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangchuan County, Yunnan Province, said that in the past, our cooperative suffered a great loss due to not paying attention to the development of sideline production. Since responding to the call for diligence and thrift in building the country and diligence and thrift in managing the home, we have mobilized women members to offer ideas and find solutions. The number of pigs and chickens in the cooperative has quickly increased eight or nine times. Last year, the cooperative's collective sideline income alone was 70,000 yuan.

In their joint speech, military officers' family members Li Cuixia, Chi Dui, and Lü Xiuwen used vivid examples to illustrate the situation of many military families carrying forward the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity and managing their homes diligently and thriftily.

Wang 䓍dong, a Li ethnic representative from Hainan Island, and Liu Biqing, a Zhuang ethnic representative from Guangxi, also spoke at the meeting. They both expressed their support for the report of the congress and said that they would publicize and implement the policy of "building the country through diligence and thrift and managing the home diligently and thriftily" among women of their respective ethnic groups.

During a break at the congress, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman, met with Gao Fengqin, Xia Guizhen, Shen Yuzhen, Li Chunpei, Kong Zhaoming, and other experts in diligence and thrift in managing the home. They exchanged cordial greetings and took a group photo.

　　要勤俭建国必须勤俭持家
　　每个妇女都应重视家务劳动、厉行勤俭，为国家建设贡献力量
    据新华社17日讯　妇女代表们在今天举行的中国妇女第三次全国代表大会上强调说，妇女在操持家务方面的贡献，会在社会主义建设中发生巨大的作用。特别在副业生产和节约粮食方面，广大妇女的潜力是无限的。
    很多代表在会上用具体事例说明了个人、家庭同国家的重大关系。内务部农村救济司司长熊天荆在会上说，家庭是国家和社会的组成细胞，在社会主义制度下，国家、集体同家庭、个人之间血肉相关，有着一致的根本利益，国家的富强依靠每个家庭和个人的艰苦奋斗。熊天荆说，有些人认为：家务劳动是卑贱的，只有生产劳动才是光荣的；又说操持家务是没有出息的，只有参加社会工作才有前途。她批评了这种轻视家务劳动的思想，她要求每个家庭和个人都要在厉行勤俭中对国家建设贡献一份力量。
    山东省昌潍专区妇联副主任温桂芝在会上说，这个专区一年以来由于向妇女进行了勤俭建国、勤俭持家的教育，妇女在养猪方面作出了重大成绩，这个专区的益都县从去年7月到今年8月，毛猪由四万头发展到七万三千多头。妇女们养猪事业的开展，不仅直接促进了农业生产，并且大大增加了社员家庭的收入。根据昌潍专区的调查，有的地方因为增施了猪肥，每亩土地增产了十八斤粮食，养猪的收入占了家庭农副业总收入的20％以上。安徽省妇联主任吴光在会上也强调了妇女在这方面的重大作用。她说，现在安徽全省养猪七百多万头。如果妇女们再多加一把劲，每户平均养猪两头，每户就可以增加六十到八十元的收入，全省就可以多供应国家三百万头肥猪。每户点滴的贡献，对国家却是一个重大的支援。
    代表们谈到粮食的节约时说，妇女是“家庭粮库主任”，节约粮食主要依靠妇女。山东省昌潍专区在发动妇女节约粮食中，主要是从堵塞浪费漏洞和合理使用着手。不少农户经过仔细计算和改进生活管理，不仅粮食够吃，而且有剩余。这个专区曾经以一个乡妇代会主任的家庭用粮计划来推算，每户每天节约四两粮，全专区就有信心在一年当中节约一亿三千多万斤粮食。云南省江川县三街乡农业社副主任张竹香说，为了千方百计的节约粮食，我们社开展了“一人一窍”运动，一个社一年就为国家节约了一百八十多万斤粮食。
    会上强调组织妇女参加各种各样的副业生产，是勤俭持家的一个重要方面。熊天荆说，河北省安次县在今年2月春荒紧张时，由于发动一万多妇女参加了副业生产，抽出足够的男劳动力参加农业生产，不仅保证了备耕工作的顺利进行，而且得到九万九千多元的副业收益，胜利地度过了春荒，云南省江川县三街乡农业社副主任张竹香说，过去我们社不注意发展副业生产吃了大亏。自从响应勤俭建国勤俭持家的号召以后，我们发动妇女社员出主意、想办法，社内的猪、鸡很快增加了八、九倍，去年全社仅集体副业就收入了七万元。
    军官家属李翠霞、驰队、吕秀文的联合发言中，用生动的事例说明许多军队的家属发扬艰苦朴素的光荣传统勤俭持家的情况。
    海南岛黎族代表王?东、广西僮族代表刘碧清也在会上发了言，她们都表示拥护大会的报告，并要在本民族妇女中宣传贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的方针。
    全国妇联主席蔡畅、副主席邓颖超在大会休息时同勤俭持家能手高凤琴、夏桂珍、沈玉珍、李春培、孔昭明等人见了面，她们互相亲切问候，并合影留念。
