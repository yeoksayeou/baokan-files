By explaining the rationale to the farmer masses
Grain supply in disaster areas can also be reduced
Qin'an County, Gansu Province, can reduce supply by four million jin

    (Our dispatch) According to the results of political and ideological education conducted by the leading organs of Qin'an County, Gansu Province, in some agricultural cooperatives, as long as the rationale is explained clearly to the disaster-stricken farmers, the grain supply in the disaster areas can be appropriately reduced.
    Qin'an County suffered severe frost and drought this summer, resulting in an overall production reduction of more than 50% across the county, with some areas experiencing reductions of 70% to 80%. After the disaster, farmers were generally worried about future grain supplies, so they tried to report as much supply as possible; even households with grain reserves clamored for government supply. Many grassroots cadres, fearing alienation from the masses, followed the farmers in demanding grain from the government, regardless of whether the masses had surplus grain. Some cadres exaggerated the disaster situation, requesting far more grain than actually needed. According to a survey of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative: twenty-four households had grain reserves, but grain supply certificates for 6,500 jin were issued, which was not necessary at all. In addition, twenty-eight households were supplied more than necessary, with an oversupply of more than 3,000 jin of grain. One landlord's household owed the state more than 300 jin of grain last year. After the disaster, the cadres decided to supply them with 100 jin. It has now been found that his family has 3,000 jin of grain in storage.
    Based on the above situation, the leading organs of Qin'an County decided to conduct political education in some agricultural cooperatives with a focus, and re-evaluate the supply standards. The education emphasized that the government provides strong support to disaster areas and guarantees supply to those who genuinely lack food, but farmers should first consume their existing grain reserves and then be supplied by the government. At the same time, it helped farmers calculate the price difference between grain purchase and sales, and persuaded them to manage their families diligently and thriftily, explaining that more supply now would result in less grain distribution in the autumn, while the price difference would still be borne by the farmers, ultimately resulting in a loss for themselves. After this education and calculation, farmers requested to return the oversupplied grain. For example, Lao Zhuang Cooperative returned more than 7,000 jin, and Yaihai Cooperative reduced 5,000 jin, both equivalent to more than 25% of the originally planned supply. Now Qin'an County has begun to conduct political education throughout the county in order to control the grain supply to a reasonable level. According to preliminary estimates, the county can compress the supply of four million jin of grain. (Yan Shugui)

    向农民群众讲清道理
    灾区粮食供应量也能压缩
    甘肃秦安县灾区可缩减供应量四百万斤
    本报讯　根据甘肃省秦安县领导机关在一些农业社进行政治思想教育以后的结果看来，只要向受灾农民讲清道理，灾区的粮食供应量是可以适当压缩的。
    秦安县今年夏田受到严重的冻灾和旱灾，全县减产达50％以上，个别地方减产70％至80％。受灾后，农民普遍担心今后粮食供应，所以尽量多报供应量；有存粮的户也嚷着要政府供应。许多基层干部怕脱离群众，不管群众有没有余粮，也跟在农民后面向政府要粮食。个别干部夸大灾情，要求供应的粮食远超过实际的需要。据“五一”农业社调查：有二十四户有存粮，而填发了六千五百斤的粮食供应证，其实根本不需要供应，另外有二十八户供应偏宽，多供应了三千多斤粮食。有一户地主，去年拖欠国家粮食三百多斤，受灾后，干部决定给供应一百斤。现在查明，他家有三千斤存粮。
    秦安县领导机关根据上述情况，决定有重点地对一些农业社进行政治教育，并重新评定供应标准。教育中着重说明，政府对灾区大力支援，对确实缺口粮的一定保证供应，但是农民应该先吃己有的存粮，然后再由政府供应。同时帮助农民算粮食购销差价，劝导农民勤俭治家。说明目前供应多了，秋后就分粮少，而差价仍由农民负担。最后还是自己吃亏。经过这样教育和算账，农民纷纷要求退回多供应的粮食。如老庄社退掉七千多斤，崖海社减掉五千斤，都相当于原计划供应量的25％以上。现在秦安县已着手在全县进行政治教育，以便把粮食供应量控制到合理的程度。据初步估算，全县可压缩供应量四百万斤粮食。　    （燕树桂）
