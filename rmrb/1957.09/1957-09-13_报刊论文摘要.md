    Human Nature, Class Nature, and Party Spirit are Unified
    In a class society, a person's class nature is what is called human nature or the essential attribute of human beings. Because each person is in a different class position, different human natures appear. Party spirit is the highest and most concentrated expression of this class nature and human nature. People belonging to various classes have the party spirit of their own class. The bourgeoisie has bourgeois party spirit, and the proletariat has proletarian party spirit. The party spirit of members of bourgeois political parties is the highest and most concentrated expression of bourgeois class nature and human nature; the party spirit of Communist Party members is the highest and most concentrated expression of proletarian class nature and human nature. Human nature, class nature, and party spirit are unified. Human nature and class nature are sharply expressed through party spirit. The bourgeois rightists' attack on the party spirit of communists is precisely a stubborn manifestation of bourgeois party spirit. The purpose of their attack is to attempt to replace the Communist Party's party spirit with the bourgeois party spirit. Bourgeois rightists slander our Communist Party members' party spirit as "inhuman" and "not recognizing relatives." Here, we must make it clear that "human feelings" are a manifestation of class ideology, and "relatives" also have their own class positions, all of which are class-based. The question is "close to" whose "feelings" and "recognize" whose "relatives." There is a clear boundary, which is the class standpoint. (Excerpt from Chen Shulin, "Does Having Party Spirit Mean Not Having Human Nature?" "Study" semi-monthly, No. 17, 1957?)
    Only Our News Undertakings are Free
    In the socialist family, not only is our news undertaking free, but each of us also fully enjoys the right to freedom of speech stipulated in the Constitution. But the rightists are of a different mind from us and are taking a different path. What they are taking is not the socialist road, but the capitalist road. They attempt to peddle anti-Party and anti-socialist wares in the socialist newspapers led by the Party, so that our newspapers will deteriorate. This is not allowed by the Constitution, nor is it allowed by the vast majority of the people. They, of course, feel "unfree" because they cannot act according to their reactionary intentions. They reverse right and wrong by saying that we, the entire people's news undertaking, have no freedom because the people do not allow them to have "freedom of speech" that is anti-Party and anti-socialist.
    Different from bourgeois newspapers, our newspapers are a reflection of the socialist economy, that is, the planned economy based on public ownership, through news media. Bourgeois newspapers are a reflection of the anarchic and group-competing economy through news media. Our newspapers are not only essentially different from bourgeois newspapers, but also different from bourgeois newspapers in their relationship with readers. To the enemy, our newspapers are tools of class struggle; to the people, our newspapers are propaganda tools for educating the masses, guiding everyone to take the correct socialist road, and encouraging everyone to actively build a socialist society. Our newspapers are different from commodities such as soap and toothpaste, and there is no "five-cent relationship" with readers. Today's newspapers are teachers and helpful friends to readers, rather than relying on vulgar, boring, or even harmful things like "man bites dog" to attract readers.

　　报刊论文摘要
    人性、阶级性、党性是统一的
    在阶级社会里，人的阶级性，就是所谓的人性或人的本质属性。由于每个人所处的阶级地位不同，于是就出现了不同的人性。党性，就是人们这种阶级性、人性最高而集中的表现。属于各个阶级的人们，都有其本阶级的党性。资产阶级的人有资产阶级的党性，无产阶级的人有无产阶级的党性。资产阶级政党党员的党性，是资产阶级阶级性、人性的最高而集中的表现；共产党员的党性，是无产阶级阶级性、人性的最高而集中的表现。人性、阶级性、党性是统一的。人性、阶级性通过党性而尖锐的表现出来。资产阶级右派分子攻击共产党人的党性，正是资产阶级党性顽强的表现。他们攻击的目的，就是企图以资产阶级的党性来代替共产党的党性。资产阶级右派分子诬蔑我们共产党员的党性是“不近人情”、“六亲不认”。这里，我们必须说清楚，“人情”是阶级意识形态的表现，“六亲”也各有自己的阶级地位，都是有阶级性的。问题在于“近”什么人的“情”，“认”什么人的“亲”。其中有一个显明的界限，这就是阶级立场。（摘自1957年“学习”半月刊第十七期，陈树林：“有了党性，就没有人性吗”？）
    只有我们的新闻事业才是自由的
    在社会主义大家庭里，不但我们的新闻事业是自由的，我们每一个人也都充分地享受着宪法上规定的言论自由的权利。但右派分子和我们是两条心，走着另一条路，他们走的不是社会主义道路，而是资本主义道路。他们企图在党所领导的社会主义报纸上贩卖反党反社会主义的货色，使我们的报纸变质，这是宪法所不允许的，也是绝大多数人民所不允许的。不能按他们的反动意图办事，他们当然要感觉“不自由”。他们把人民不允许他们有反党反社会主义的“言论自由”颠倒是非地说成我们整个人民新闻事业是没有自由的。
    和资产阶级报纸不同，我们的报纸是社会主义经济即在公有制基础上的计划经济通过新闻手段的反映。资产阶级报纸是无政府状态的和集团竞争的经济通过新闻手段的反映。我们的报纸不但在本质上和资产阶级报纸不同，而且在和读者的关系上也和资产阶级报纸不同。对敌人来说，我们的报纸是阶级斗争的工具；对人民来说，我们的报纸则是教育群众、引导大家走社会主义正确道路、鼓舞大家积极建设社会主义社会的宣传工具。我们的报纸和那些肥皂牙膏一般商品不同，和读者之间更不是什么“五分钱关系”。今天的报纸是读者的良师益友，而不是靠“人咬狗”那一类庸俗、无聊、甚至有害的东西来吸引读者。（摘自8月30日北京日报蒋荫恩：“新闻自由与立场”）
