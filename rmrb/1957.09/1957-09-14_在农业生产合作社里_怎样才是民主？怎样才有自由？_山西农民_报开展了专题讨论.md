Xinhua News Agency report:
　　The "Shanxi Peasant" newspaper organized a special discussion on issues such as democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline within agricultural cooperatives from April to August.

　　During the discussion, everyone generally connected with their own thoughts and deeply studied the principles and significance of running cooperatives democratically, criticized some cadres for fearing the implementation of democracy, believing that it would be difficult to be a cadre if democracy were implemented, and that following the mass line was troublesome and other incorrect ideas. At the same time, it also criticized some members for lacking a sense of ownership, only seeking personal leisure and unwilling to be involved in cooperative affairs. Through the discussion, the vast number of cadres and members further understood the significance of running cooperatives democratically, the cadres strengthened their thinking on running cooperatives democratically, and the members established the viewpoint of being masters of their own affairs.

　　Many issues were first discussed and醞釀ed among the masses within the cooperative before being discussed in the newspaper, and then the conclusions reached and the remaining points of divergence were written down and submitted. Therefore, the discussion proceeded gradually and deepened from the beginning, truly going through debates and resolving ideological problems. For example, during the rush planting of late autumn crops in the first production team of the Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Jincheng County, members dispersed and went home before noon, and criticized the production team leader who tried to dissuade them for violating democracy. Recently, influenced by the discussion in the newspaper, this team conducted a debate. Initially, some people believed that as long as everyone agreed, it was democracy, and cadres had to obey, otherwise it would be a violation of democracy and a failure to follow the mass line. The debate did not immediately criticize this erroneous understanding, but rather expanded the issue for detailed analysis. As a result, the members realized that if "democracy" continued like this, crops would not grow, there would be no harvest in the autumn, and it would be a "democracy" that would lead to starvation and suffering. They naturally realized that talking about democracy without limits and without discipline was a false democracy that would accomplish nothing and spoil everything. After the ideological understanding was improved, the line between right and wrong was clearly drawn. Feng Xiaoliu, the member who took the lead in dispersing and going home, was severely criticized, and the production team leader who insisted on correct leadership was praised by the entire cooperative. When discussing the issue of freedom and discipline, agricultural cooperatives in Guangling, Jiaocheng, Ningwu and other places also conducted collective research on specific issues such as members taking corn cobs from the cooperative at will, and members leaving at will without participating in labor, thereby gaining a clear understanding of the relationship between freedom and discipline. Everyone realized that in agricultural cooperatives, everyone has freedom, and at the same time, there are consciously observed disciplinary constraints. Members have the right to enjoy the freedom of the cooperative, and also have the obligation to abide by discipline.

　　The discussion also revealed some contentious issues that took a lot of persuasion. For example, whether or not to talk about democracy with backward members, and whether forced work has better results or following the mass line has better results, everyone patiently and thoroughly criticized and educated them. Guan Er Mao Dan, a member of the Dahebao Agricultural Cooperative in Ningwu County, stubbornly believed for a long time in the discussion that if you want to talk about democracy, you shouldn't talk about centralization, and if you want to talk about centralization, you shouldn't talk about democracy; and the discussion went from his cooperative all the way to the newspaper. It was only after everyone cited many specific facts that he was able to come to his senses.

　　At the end of the discussion, the editorial department of the "Shanxi Peasant" newspaper made a summary. More than 75% of the counties in the province submitted articles, and the newspaper received more than 280 speeches. However, it is still not deep enough, and complex situations and difficulties will be encountered in actual work. The editorial department hopes that everyone will further expand the debate and consolidate the results of the discussion.

### 在农业生产合作社里　怎样才是民主？怎样才有自由？　“山西农民”报开展了专题讨论

　　在农业生产合作社里
　　怎样才是民主？怎样才有自由？
　　“山西农民”报开展了专题讨论
    新华社讯  “山西农民”报从4月到8月组织了农业社内部民主与集中、自由与纪律等问题的专题讨论。
    在讨论过程中，大家一般地联系思想，深入学习了民主办社的方针、意义，批判了某些干部怕实行民主，认为实行民主干部难当，走群众路线是麻烦等不正确的思想。同时也批判了有些社员缺乏主人翁感觉，只图个人清闲不愿过问社内事务。通过讨论，广大干部和社员进一步理解了民主办社的意义，干部增强了民主办社思想，社员树立了当家作主的观点。
    很多问题在报上讨论以前，先在社内开展了群众性的酝酿，然后把得到了的结论和遗留的分歧点写出来投稿。因此讨论从开始就循序渐进，逐步深入，真正经过争论，解决思想问题。例如晋城县新胜农业社第一生产队在抢种晚秋时，社员们不到中午就走散回家，并且批评劝阻他们的生产队长是违反民主。最近，这个队在报纸开展讨论的影响下，作了一次辩论。开始有人认为只要大伙同意就算民主，干部就得服从，否则就是违反民主，不走群众路线。辩论会上没有马上批判这种错误认识，而是把问题伸展开来作详细分析。结果，社员了解到这样“民主”下去，庄稼长不上，秋季无收获，是挨饿受罪的“民主”，很自然地认识了讲民主没有界限，没有纪律，是成事不足，坏事有余的假民主。思想认识提高以后，谁是谁非就划清了界限。带头走散回家的社员冯小六受到严厉批评，坚持正确领导的生产队长受到全社表扬。在讨论自由和纪律问题时，广灵、交城、宁武等地的农业社，也对社员乱拿社里玉米穗，社员随便外出不参加劳动等具体问题，作了集体研究，从而对自由与纪律的关系得到清晰的认识。大家都认识到在农业社里，人人都有自由，同时也有自觉遵守的纪律约束。社员既有享受社里自由的权利，也有遵守纪律的义务。
    在讨论中也发现一些颇费唇舌的争执问题。如对落后社员该不该讲民主、包括强迫工作效果好还是走群众路线效果好等，大家都耐心详尽地作了批判教育。宁武县大河堡农业社社员关二毛旦在讨论中曾长期固执地认为要讲民主就不要集中，要集中就不要民主；而且从他所在的社里一直讨论到报上。经过大家列举了好多具体事实，才使他清醒过来。
    讨论结束时，由“山西农民”报编辑部作了总结。全省有75％以上的县都投了稿，报社共收到二百八十多篇发言稿。但是仍然不够深刻，在实际工作中还会遇到复杂的情况和困难。编辑部希望大家进一步展开争论，巩固讨论的效果。
