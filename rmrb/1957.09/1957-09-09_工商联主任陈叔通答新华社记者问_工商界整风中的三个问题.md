Chen Shutong, Director of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Answers Xinhua News Agency Reporter's Questions: Three Questions in the Rectification Campaign in Industry and Commerce
Why should industry and commerce conduct rectification and anti-rightist struggles? Why is it necessary to expose the ugly history of rightists in the anti-rightist struggle? Why is the capitalist stance a reactionary stance?

Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: A comprehensive rectification movement, including the anti-rightist struggle, is about to be universally launched nationwide in industry and commerce. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, today gave an interview to a Xinhua News Agency reporter specifically on some ideological issues that currently exist among many industrialists and businessmen regarding the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle.

The anti-rightist struggle was by no means manufactured by the Party and the government, but was the result of the rightists' rampant attacks on the Party and the people.

Chen Shutong pointed out at the beginning of the conversation: "Currently, some industrialists and businessmen suspect how this anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement started, and whether it is, as Zhang Naqi said: another 'Five-Anti' is coming? This suspicion is completely wrong."

"Since the anti-rightist struggle began, many industrialists and businessmen have begun to open their eyes and realize that the rightists are trying every possible means to obstruct and sabotage our further acceptance of socialist transformation. Zhang Naqi said not to emphasize transformation, believing that industry and commerce could no longer hold their heads up, and further emphasizing transformation would cause 'endless worries' for industrialists and businessmen. He also said that industrialists and businessmen had already passed five tests, and if they were to be transformed again, would there be another 'Five-Anti'? Zhang Naqi used all means of provocation, incitement, and intimidation to hinder industrialists and businessmen from further accepting transformation."

"We must expose the rightists' nonsense that the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement were just initiated by the Party and the government. Taking the 'Five-Anti' movement as an example, before the movement started, the Party and the government originally only planned to carry out a 'Three-Anti' movement with the content of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. When the leading comrades of the Party talked to us, they only mentioned the 'Three-Anti', not the 'Five-Anti'. I still remember this clearly. However, in the 'Three-Anti' movement, the facts of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the state were discovered, first the fact that industrialists and businessmen bribed state cadres, and consequently many serious illegal acts were discovered. Thus, the 'Five-Anti' had to be launched along with the 'Three-Anti'. Therefore, the 'Five-Anti' movement was actually launched after the bourgeoisie first committed the 'five poisons'."

"This anti-rightist struggle and rectification is the same. When the Party started the rectification, it repeatedly stated that it sincerely welcomed the democratic parties and people's organizations to help the Party with the rectification, and at the same time expressed the hope that the democratic parties and people's organizations would not rectify themselves. This is known to everyone in the democratic parties and people's organizations. Unexpectedly, during the great blooming and contending, a group of anti-Party and anti-socialist rightists appeared. Under the guise of 'helping the Party with rectification', they launched rampant attacks on the Party, even fantasizing about restoring capitalism in our country. In this way, the Party and the people certainly could not sit idly by and had to rise up and fight back. Therefore, the anti-rightist struggle is in fact the result of the rightists' rampant attacks on the Party and the people. This is a very obvious fact. It must be understood that the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement are the best forms of education for us industrialists and businessmen to conduct self-transformation. Since the full industry-wide public-private partnership, we have basically completed the socialist transformation economically, but politically and ideologically, the question of which is superior and where to go between the two paths of capitalism and socialism has not been resolved. Carrying out a comprehensive rectification movement on the basis of the initial victory of the anti-rightist struggle is to change our political stance and help us pass the socialist test well. Therefore, this rectification is really a great good thing for our industry and commerce, which everyone should actively participate in with joy and excitement."

Exposing the ugly history of rightists is not "revisiting old scores," but to find out the origin and development of their reactionary words and deeds.

Chen Shutong then talked about some industrialists and businessmen currently seeing the exposure of the ugly history of rightists in the anti-rightist struggle, which has caused concerns that the Communist Party and the government will "revisit old scores." He pointed out that this is also wrong.

Chen Shutong said: "You should know that the Party and the government have already leniently summarized the old accounts before liberation. Many people now not only have jobs, but also have political status. This proves that as long as they can repent and start anew, the people generally do not hold them accountable for the past."

"However, why is it necessary to expose the history of individual rightists now? This is because these people's reactionary stance has not changed at all, or has relapsed, and they are launching new attacks on the Party, the people, and socialism, and have committed new crimes. In this way, the people cannot help but expose and criticize them. And in the exposure and criticism, in order to find out the origin and development of their reactionary words and deeds and dig out their old roots, it is necessary to look into the old accounts. But looking into the old accounts is not equal to 'revisiting old scores.' What the people want to settle with them is the new accounts, and generally not the old accounts. As for how to settle the new accounts, it still depends on the rightists' own self-criticism, whether it is honest, whether it is sincere, and whether they bow their heads to the people, admit their guilt, and accept transformation before a final decision can be made."

"In fact, if the rightists are truly willing to sincerely and deeply examine themselves, change their reactionary stance, and accept transformation, they should automatically review their own old accounts, which is beneficial to their repentance and renewal. Bowing one's head to admit guilt and accepting transformation should solve problems ideologically, not just talk about it verbally and muddle through. Since liberation, the Party has always adhered to the policy of treating the illness to save the patient and being kind to people. As an ancient saying goes: 'If the medicine does not make you dizzy, the disease will not be cured,' and 'The gentleman loves people with virtue, and the petty man loves people with indulgence.' This also shows that treating the illness to save the patient must be thorough. If it is not thorough, the disease cannot be cured and people cannot be saved. It also shows that sentimentalism cannot treat the illness and save people. This anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement hopes that everyone can pass the socialist test smoothly. If everyone can appreciate this, they should actively and bravely transform themselves with a grateful heart."

In the era of building socialism, the capitalist stance is a reactionary stance.

Chen Shutong finally talked about why the capitalist stance is now a reactionary stance.

Chen Shutong said: "Many industrialists and businessmen were not clear about this issue in their ideological understanding in the past. They still hold the idea of the coexistence of five economic components in the early days of the founding of the country, and have not understood that our country has basically completed the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production economically and has basically established the socialist system. The Constitution stipulates very clearly that our country's new democratic society is to transition to a socialist society. That is to say, the five economic components are to be transformed into a single socialist economic component, and capitalism must be eliminated. The times are advancing, but many industrialists and businessmen still hold old views and positions, and have not realized that the capitalist economy and the capitalist stance are now reactionary."

"The capitalist stance and socialism are incompatible. Now that our country is building a socialist society, if we still insist on the capitalist stance, it means that we are unwilling to move forward on the socialist road. Not advancing means retreating. Retreating means going back to the capitalist road, which is capitalist restoration, which becomes reactionary. This is beyond doubt."

Chen Shutong finally said: "Our industrialists and businessmen are willing to transition to socialism through peaceful means, but we must take the same path as the working class, that is, the socialist path. The people of the whole country are to unite under the leadership of the Communist Party and on the basis of socialism. This rectification is also to carry out in-depth criticism and self-criticism in accordance with Chairman Mao's formula of unity-criticism-unity, so that industrialists and businessmen know what to choose between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Therefore, on the one hand, our industrialists and businessmen must resolutely carry out the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and not let the rightists lead us to a dead end; on the other hand, we must also conscientiously transform our own thoughts and change our political stance. In this way, we can pass the socialist test well and strive for our bright future."

    工商联主任陈叔通答新华社记者问
    工商界整风中的三个问题
    工商界为什么要进行整风和反右派斗争？在反右派斗争中为什么要揭露右派分子的丑恶历史？资本主义立场为什么是反动立场？
    新华社8日讯　工商界包括反右派斗争在内的全面整风运动即将在全国范围内普遍开展。中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通，今天特就目前不少工商业者在整风运动和反右派斗争中思想认识上存在的一些问题对新华社记者发表谈话。
    反右派斗争绝不是党和政府制造的，而是右派分子向党向人民猖狂进攻的结果
    陈叔通在谈话中首先指出：“目前有些工商业者怀疑这次反右派斗争和整风运动是怎样搞起来的，是不是如章乃器所说：又要来一次‘五反’？这种怀疑是完全错误的”。
    “自从反右派斗争开展以后，很多工商业者开始擦亮了眼睛，认识到右派分子对于我们工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造是千方百计地加以阻挠和破坏的。章乃器就说过不要强调改造，认为工商界已经抬不起头来，再要强调改造就会使工商业者发生‘无穷忧虑’，而且说工商业者已经过了五关，再要改造，是不是还要来一次‘五反’。章乃器是用尽了挑拨、煽动、恐吓的手段来阻碍工商业者进一步接受改造。”
    “我们一定要揭露右派分子所谓反右派斗争和整风运动只是党和政府搞起来的胡说。即以‘五反’运动来说，在运动还未开展以前，党和政府本来只准备进行一个以反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义为内容的‘三反’运动，党的领导同志同我们谈话时，提到的也只是‘三反’，而不是‘五反’。这一点，我到现在还记得清清楚楚。但是，在
  ‘三反’运动中，发觉了资产阶级向国家猖狂进攻的事实，首先是发觉了工商业者向国家干部行贿的事实，因而又发觉了不少严重的不法行为，这样，便不得不随着‘三反’，开展了‘五反’。所以，‘五反’运动实际上是资产阶级先犯了‘五毒’，然后才发动起来的。”
    “这次反右派斗争和整风也是一样。党在整风开始的时候，曾一再表示，诚恳欢迎各民主党派和人民团体帮助党整风，同时并表示不希望各民主党派和人民团体自己也整风。这是各民主党派和人民团体大家都知道的。没有料到在大鸣大放中，出现了一群反党、反社会主义的右派分子，他们以‘帮助党整风’为名，向党猖狂进攻；甚至幻想使资本主义在我国复辟。这样，党和人民当然不能坐视，当然必须起而反击。因此，反右派斗争，事实上是右派分子向党、向人民猖狂进攻的结果，这是很明显的事实。必须知道，反右派斗争和整风运动，这是我们工商业者进行自我改造的最好的教育形式。自从全行业公私合营以后，我们在经济上基本完成了社会主义改造，而在政治立场上和思想上，对于资本主义和社会主义两条道路的谁劣谁优、何去何从的问题是并没有解决的。在反右派斗争的初步胜利的基础上开展一个全面整风运动，就是为了改变我们的政治立场，帮助我们过好社会主义这一关。所以，这次整风对我们工商界来说，实在是大家都应欢欣鼓舞地积极参加的大大的好事情。”
    揭露右派分子的丑恶历史，并非“倒算旧账”，而是为了弄清楚他们反动言行的来龙去脉
    陈叔通接着谈到目前有些工商业者，在反右派斗争中看到揭露右派分子的丑恶历史，产生了顾虑，认为共产党和政府要“倒算旧账”。他指出，这也是错误的。
    陈叔通说：“要知道，解放前的旧账，党和政府所知道的已经从宽总结过了。很多人现在不但有工作，而且有政治地位。这就证明，只要他们能够悔过自新，人民对他们一般是既往不咎的。”
    “然而，为什么现在对于个别的右派分子，又要揭他们的历史呢？这是因为这些人的反动立场原封未动，或者是故态复萌，对党、对人民、对社会主义进行新的进攻，有了新的罪行的缘故。照这样，就不能不引起人民对他们的揭露和批判。而在揭露和批判中，为了要弄清楚他们反动言行的来龙去脉，挖掘他们的老根，就势必要查一下旧账。但是查旧账并不等于‘倒算旧账’。人民要对他们算的是新账，一般是不算旧账的。至于新账怎样算法，仍要看右派分子自己的检讨，是不是老老实实，是不是诚心诚意，是不是向人民低头认罪，接受改造，才能作最后决定。”
    “其实，如果右派分子真正愿意真心诚意地深刻检讨，改变自己的反动立场，接受改造，他们应该自动地把自己的旧账翻一翻，这对他们改过自新是有好处的。低头认罪，接受改造，应该从思想上解决问题，而不应该只是口头说说，蒙混过关。解放以来，党始终抱定治病救人、与人为善的方针。古训有云：‘若药不瞑眩，厥疾弗廖’，又云：‘君子之爱人也以德，小人之爱人也以姑息’，这也是说明治病救人要彻底，不彻底治不了病，救不了人，就是说明温情主义是不能治病救人的。这次反右派斗争和整风运动，是希望大家平平稳稳地过好社会主义关。大家能体会到这一点，就应该以感激的心情，积极地勇敢地改造自己。”
    在建设社会主义的时代，资本主义立场就是反动的立场
    陈叔通最后谈到资本主义立场为什么在现在已经是一种反动的立场的问题。
    陈叔通说：“对于这个问题，很多工商业者过去在思想认识上是不明确的。他们还抱着开国初期五种经济成分并存的思想，没有理解目前我国在经济上已经基本完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，基本上建立了社会主义制度。宪法上规定得很清楚，我国新民主主义社会是要过渡到社会主义社会的。也就是五种经济成分要变为单一的社会主义经济成分，资本主义是一定要消灭的。时代是在前进，但是，许多工商业者还抱着陈旧的观点、立场，并没有认识到资本主义经济和资本主义立场现在已经是反动的了。”
    “资本主义立场和社会主义是不相容的。现在，我国正在建设社会主义社会，倘若还要坚持资本主义立场，那就是不愿在社会主义道路上前进。不前进，即后退。后退就是倒退到资本主义道路上去，就是资本主义复辟，也就变成反动。这是无庸置疑的。”
    陈叔通最后说：“我们工商业者都愿意通过和平的道路过渡到社会主义，但必须要同工人阶级走同一道路，也就是社会主义的道路。全国人民是要在共产党的领导下、在社会主义的基础上团结起来的。这次整风，也就是为了要本着毛主席的团结——批评——团结的公式，进行深入的批评与自我批评，使工商业者对于社会主义和资本主义两条道路知所抉择。因此，我们工商业者一方面要坚决进行反右派斗争和整风运动，不让右派分子带引我们走上绝路；一方面还要认真地改造自己的思想，改变我们的政治立场。这样，才能过好社会主义这一关，才能争取我们的光明前途。”
