Xinhua News Agency, 10th - The Third National Women's Congress of China continued its sessions this afternoon. In their speeches, delegates expressed their support for the work report made by Comrade Zhang Yun on behalf of the previous Executive Committee of the Women's Federation, and many refuted the fallacies of rightist elements in women's circles who slandered the Party, the government, and women's work.

The Congress began at 3:00 PM. Cao Guanqun delivered a report on the Constitution of the All-China Women's Federation.

At today's meeting, the delegates accepted the congratulations of the Soviet women's representatives with great enthusiasm. Many working women present felt uplifted. They admired the Soviet Union and loved socialism. When the head of the Soviet women's delegation, Comrade Leontyeva, stepped onto the podium, the entire audience warmly welcomed her with sustained applause. Leontyeva, on behalf of Soviet women, extended warm congratulations to the delegates and all Chinese women. Leontyeva also read the congratulatory message from the Soviet Women's Committee to the Congress and presented gifts to the All-China Women's Federation.

The speech by Nguyen Thi Thap, head of the Vietnamese women's delegation, deeply moved the delegates. She also presented to the Congress, on behalf of the Vietnam Women's Union, an embroidered hanging screen of the One Pillar Pagoda, a historical site in Hanoi, and a silk banner embroidered with the words "Long Live the Profound Sisterly Friendship Between Chinese and Vietnamese Women."

Mrs. Nehru, Chair of the Indian Asian Solidarity Committee, who was invited to attend the Congress, was welcomed to the podium with sustained applause. She greeted everyone with her palms together.

This afternoon, seven delegates spoke at the meeting. Peng Qing, Director of the Hebei Provincial Women's Federation, exposed and refuted the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Liu Wang Liming. Peng Qing said that when the Zhang-Luo alliance attacked the Communist Party in May of this year, the rightist Liu Wang Liming said at a meeting of non-Party standing committee members and executive committee members convened by the Central Women's Committee and the Party Group of the All-China Women's Federation: "Many people in rural North China are eating chaff and wild grasses," and questioned whether the central authorities knew about it. She also fabricated a story, saying, "In Wangkui Village, Sanhe County, Hebei Province, the father of a demobilized soldier, because of robbing property, strangled his son, who had been separated for many years and had just returned from the army, on the way." Peng Qing said that after investigation, there was no Wangkui Village in Sanhe County at all, and no such incident had occurred anywhere in the county. The facts proved that Liu Wang Liming completely fabricated rumors and slandered.

Peng Qing also cited facts to refute Liu Wang Liming's slander that "the people of Hebei Province live in misery and the Party and government leaders are indifferent to the people's lives." Peng Qing said that Liu Wang Liming distorted the facts, reversed black and white, and maliciously attacked the Communist Party and the government, which the broad masses of women and people in Hebei Province could not agree to.

Also speaking at the meeting today were Tang Fenglan, a female worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Large Rolling Mill; Qubi Azhi, a Yi ethnic minority woman representative from Sichuan Province; Cao Binru, manager of the Chengdu Joint State-Private Gengding Pharmacy; Kuang Jianlian (Hong Xiannu), a famous Cantonese opera actress; Zhou Tongxiang, director of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative in Nansu Village, Yexian County, Shandong Province; and Li Chunpei, a "Five-Good" model worker's family member from Wuhan.

This morning, the delegates held group discussions. Delegates from Zhejiang and Shanghai respectively launched struggles against the rightists Liu Wang Liming and Peng Zigang.

　　向妇女界右派分子展开说理斗争
　　大会以巨大热情来接受各国妇女代表的祝贺
    据新华社10日讯　中国妇女第三次全国代表大会今天下午继续举行大会。代表们在发言中，表示拥护章蕴代表前届妇联执委会所作的工作报告，许多人并驳斥了妇女界中右派分子诋毁党、政府和妇女工作的谬论。
    大会从下午三时开始举行。曹冠群在会上作了关于中华人民共和国妇女联合会章程的报告。
    在今天的会上，代表们以巨大热情来接受苏联妇女代表的祝贺。在场的许多劳动妇女扬眉吐气，她们向往苏联，热爱社会主义，当苏联妇女代表团团长列昂节娃登上讲台时，全场热烈欢迎，掌声经久不息。列昂节娃代表苏联妇女向大会代表和全中国妇女热诚地祝贺。列昂节娃并在会上宣读了苏联妇女委员会向大会的祝辞，向全国妇联赠送了礼物。
    越南妇女代表团团长阮氏十的致词深深打动了代表们的心。她还代表越南妇女联合会向大会赠送了河内古迹一柱寺的刺绣挂屏，及绣有“中越两国妇女姊妹般的深厚友谊万岁”字样的锦旗。
    应邀出席大会的印度亚洲团结委员会主席尼赫鲁夫人被经久不息的掌声迎上讲台，她双手合十向大家致意。
    今天下午，有七位代表在会上发言。河北省妇联主任彭青在会上揭露和驳斥了右派分子刘王立明的反动言行。彭青说，当今年5月章、罗联盟向共产党进攻的时候，右派分子刘王立明在中央妇委和全国妇联党组召开的非党常委和执委的会上说：华北农村许多人在吃糠和野草，并责问中央机关究竟知道不？她还捏造说：“河北省三河县王奎村有一个复员军人的父亲，因抢劫财物把分别多年已不认识、刚从军队复员回来的儿子在半途掐死了。”彭青说，经过调查，三河县根本没有这个王奎村，全县境内更没发生过这样的事情。事实证明完全是刘王立明造谣诽谤。
    彭青又列举事实驳斥了刘王立明所说的“河北省人民生活苦，党政领导对群众生活不闻不问”的谰言。彭青说，刘王立明歪曲事实、颠倒黑白，恶意向共产党和政府进攻，河北省广大妇女和人民是不能答应的。
