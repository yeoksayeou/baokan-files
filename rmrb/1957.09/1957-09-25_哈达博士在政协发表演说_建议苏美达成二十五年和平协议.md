Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: Former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta stated in his speech at the expanded meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today: "Peaceful coexistence between countries with ideological opposition can be gradually realized." He also expressed his deep belief that "even in the current period, countries with different ideologies can achieve peaceful coexistence."

Dr. Hatta and his entourage arrived at the CPPCC Auditorium at 10:00 AM. When Dr. Hatta, accompanied by CPPCC National Committee Chairman Zhou Enlai, ascended the podium, the entire audience burst into prolonged and enthusiastic applause.

In his speech entitled "Facing the Future," which lasted for more than an hour, Dr. Hatta focused on the painful history of Asian countries suffering from imperialist oppression, thereby clarifying the common ideals of Asian countries in opposing colonialism and demanding friendship among nations and world peace. He also said, "If the United States and the Soviet Union, the two largest countries in the world, are willing to reach an agreement guaranteeing that there will be no war between the two countries for the next twenty-five years, then a peaceful environment can be quickly formed."

Hatta then expressed his full support for peaceful coexistence between countries with different ideologies.

He said that the Republic of Indonesia has always pursued an independent and active foreign policy, "Indonesia is unwilling to join any group in a state of hostility," and "actively establishes peaceful and friendly relations with all countries, regardless of their structure and internal policies."

Finally, Dr. Hatta concluded his speech by saying: "Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, China will always make valuable contributions to the close and friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, and to the friendly relations between the Asian peoples, which are a strong foundation for the realization of international friendship."

Before Dr. Hatta's speech, Chairman Zhou Enlai spoke first to welcome Dr. Hatta's attendance and speech. After Dr. Hatta's speech, Chairman Zhou Enlai once again delivered a speech to thank Dr. Hatta.

In his speech, Zhou Enlai also expressed his agreement with the suggestion made by Dr. Hatta earlier that the Soviet Union and the United States should reach a twenty-five-year peace agreement. He said, "If such a suggestion can be realized, it will give the world peace a more lasting hope and enable the ideal of human progress to become a reality."

Chairman Zhou Enlai concluded by saying, let the people of our two countries strive against colonialism, for world peace, for friendship among nations, and for the progress and construction of our respective countries.

Also seated on the podium with Dr. Hatta and his wife were CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairmen Dong Biwu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Bao Erhan, and the Indonesian Ambassador to China and his wife.

More than 1,000 prominent figures from all walks of life in China and Indonesian friends in Beijing attended today's meeting.

    建议苏美达成二十五年和平协议
    据新华社24日讯　印度尼西亚前副总统哈达博士今天在我国政协全国委员会扩大会议上发表的演讲中说：“思想意识对立的国家之间的和平共处是会逐渐实现的。”他并表示深信“即使在目前时期，各个不同思想意识的国家也能够实现和平共处”。
    哈达博士及其随行人员在上午十时到达政协礼堂。当哈达博士由政协全国委员会周恩来主席陪同登上主席台时，全场一致响起长时间的热烈掌声。
    在哈达博士以“面向着未来”为题的一个多小时的演说中，他着重谈到了亚洲国家深受帝国主义压迫的惨痛历史，从而阐明了亚洲国家反对殖民主义以及要求各国友好与世界和平的共同理想。他还说，“假如美国和苏联这两个世界上最大的国家愿意达成一个协议，保证在未来的二十五年内两国之间不进行战争的话，那末和平的环境就能很快地形成。”
    哈达接着表示完全支持不同意识形态的国家之间的和平共处。
    他说，印度尼西亚共和国一向执行自主和积极的外交政策，“印度尼西亚不愿加入处在敌对状态中的任何集团”，“积极地和各国建立和平友好关系，不论这些国家的结构和对内政策是怎么样”。
    最后，哈达博士在结束他的讲演时说：“在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，中国将会始终对中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国的亲密友好关系，以及对为实现国际友好关系的强有力的基础的亚洲各民族间的友好关系，作出宝贵的贡献。”
    在哈达博士演讲前，周恩来主席首先讲话对哈达博士的出席讲演表示欢迎。在哈达博士演讲后，周恩来主席再次致词向哈达博士致谢。
    周恩来在讲话中还表示同意刚才哈达博士所提出的由苏联和美国达成二十五年和平协议的建议，他说：“这样的建议，如果能够实现，将使世界和平有更加持久的希望，使人类进步的理想能够变为现实。”
    周恩来主席最后说，让我们两国人民为反对殖民主义，为世界和平，为各国友好，为各自国家的进步和建设而奋斗。
    陪同哈达博士和他的夫人在主席台上就座的，还有政协全国委员会副主席董必武、李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、李维汉、陈叔通、包尔汉和印度尼西亚驻中国大使和夫人。
