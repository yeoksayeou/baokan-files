Respected Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    After the news of the Egyptian film delegation's upcoming trip to China was announced, many people came to me to convey their heartfelt congratulations to the great Chinese people.
    They represent the sincere wishes of all the Egyptian people.
    I am also fortunate to bring you greetings from Mr. Situ Huimin, Ms. Bai Yang, Ms. Qin Yi, and Mr. Peng Hourong, members of the current Chinese film delegation in Egypt.

    Generally speaking, film weeks held reciprocally by two friendly countries are often separated by a period of time, whether long or short. However, as you can see, the film weeks held in China and Egypt this time are taking place almost simultaneously, which is a good demonstration that these two countries are closely linked and moving forward together.

    We hope that the films we have brought will be loved by you, and we welcome your criticisms and suggestions regarding these films, because we have come to learn from you.

    I am very happy to tell you that Egyptian film companies are currently producing widescreen films and color films. I think you will be able to see these films soon.

    Recently, Egyptian films have adopted new themes reflecting patriotic ideas and reflecting social life, such as anti-feudalism, anti-exploitation, and opposition to all old, cursed legacies. You can see all of this in the film to be screened tonight.

    After achieving revolutionary victory, the Egyptian people have seen a flourishing scene in the arts, such as film, drama, literature, and music. A new government agency—the Arts Bureau—has been established. This institution and the Supreme Literary Committee jointly guide all national cultural activities.

    Because Egypt has established cultural relations with various friendly countries, Egyptian art will therefore develop day by day. Among these friendly relations, China occupies a prominent position.

    I am very happy to tell you that the Chinese Film Week held in Cairo was a great success. Our beloved leader, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the Arab Republic of Egypt, attended the opening ceremony of the Chinese Film Week and watched the film "The New Year Sacrifice" screened at the opening ceremony.

    Although Chinese films are meeting Egyptian audiences for the first time at a film week, I believe that films such as "The New Year Sacrifice", "Fighting in the Desert" and five other films will be welcomed by Egyptian audiences. Of these films, as far as I know, three have already been purchased by Egyptian film distributors.

    Now, please allow me to introduce Miss Faten Hamama, a famous Egyptian film actress, and Mr. Omar Sharif, a famous and promising Egyptian actor, who are husband and wife. They have a child named "Tariq" - a title of an Arab hero. I would also like to introduce Mr. Mohamed Madkour, Director of the Film Department of the Arts Bureau.

    Finally, let me shout: Long live the friendship between Egypt and China!

### 埃及电影代表团团长  耶雅·哈基的讲话

专栏：

    埃及电影代表团团长
    耶雅·哈基的讲话敬爱的朱德副主席、周恩来总理阁下：女士们、先生们：
    埃及电影代表团将要出发来中国的消息发表以后，很多人纷纷都来请我转达他们对伟大的中国人民的衷心祝贺。
    他们是代表了所有埃及人民的真诚愿望。
    我还幸运地给你们带来了现在埃及的中国电影代表团司徒慧敏先生、白杨女士、秦怡女士和彭后嵘先生对你们的致意。
    一般说来，两个友好国家相互举办电影周，往往是相隔一个或长或短的时间。但是，你们可以看到，这次在中国和埃及相互举办的电影周，则几乎是同时举行的，这就很好地证明，这两个国家是紧密地联在一起向前迈进的。
    我们带来的几部影片，希望能博得你们的喜爱，并且欢迎你们对这些影片给予批评、指教，因为，我们是来向你们学习的。
    我很高兴地告诉你们，埃及的电影公司正在摄制宽银幕影片和彩色影片。我想你们不久就能看到这些影片。
    最近埃及影片已经采取了新的反映爱国思想和反映社会生活的题材，例如反封建、反剥削和反对一切旧的遗留下来的可诅咒的东西。这一切，你们可以在今天晚上放映的影片里看到。
    埃及人民在取得了革命胜利以后，在艺术方面如电影、戏剧、文学和音乐方面都出现了欣欣向荣的景象。一个新的政府机构——艺术局已经成立了。这个机构和最高文艺委员会共同指导国家的一切文艺活动。
    由于埃及和各友好国家之间建立了文化关系，埃及的艺术将因此而日益发展。在这些友好关系中，中国是居于显著的地位。
    我很高兴地告诉诸位，在开罗举行的中国电影周获得了很大的成功。我们敬爱的领袖、埃及共和国总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔参加了中国电影周的开幕式，并观看了在开幕式上放映的影片“祝福”。
    虽然，中国影片是第一次在电影周上与埃及观众见面，但我相信，像“祝福”、“沙漠里的战斗”和其他五部影片，是会受到埃及观众的欢迎的。在这些影片中，据我了解，已经有三部由埃及的电影发行人所购买。
    现在，请让我向你们介绍埃及著名电影女演员法登·哈玛玛小姐和埃及著名的有前途的男演员奥马·薛里夫先生，他们俩是夫妻。他们有一个孩子，名字叫“达莱克”——这是一个阿拉伯英雄的称号。我还向你们介绍艺术局电影处处长穆罕默德·马德库先生。
    最后让我高呼：埃中两国友好万岁！（附图片）
