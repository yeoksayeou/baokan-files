Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 17th: In a joint communiqué regarding the results of talks issued on the 16th by the government delegations of Mongolia and Czechoslovakia, they expressed their full support for the Soviet government's proposal of September 3rd to the United States, Britain, and France regarding the Middle East issue. The two governments unanimously condemned the policy of the imperialist aggressive bloc to continue its blatant interference in the internal affairs of certain countries in the Middle East and Near East.

The joint communiqué pointed out that the two governments firmly condemned the discriminatory policies adopted by the United States and its vassal states on the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations. The Czechoslovak government is convinced that the Mongolian People's Republic has every right to occupy its rightful seat in the United Nations.

Both sides also believe that the People's Republic of China obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations will greatly strengthen the prestige of this international organization. The fact that representatives of the People's Republic of China have not yet been able to participate in the work of the United Nations and its agencies is a blatant violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter.

　　蒙捷两国发表联合公报
　　谴责西方干涉中东
    新华社布拉格17日电　蒙古和捷克斯洛伐克两国政府代表团在16日发表的有关会谈结果的联合公报中表示，它们完全支持苏联政府9月3日向美、英、法三国再次提出的关于中近东问题的建议。两国政府一致谴责帝国主义国家侵略集团继续粗暴干涉中近东某些国家内政的政策。
    联合公报指出，两国政府坚决谴责美国和它的仆从国家在联合国接纳新会员国问题上所采取的歧视政策。捷克斯洛伐克政府深信，蒙古人民共和国绝对有权利在联合国中占有它应得的席位。
    双方并且认为，中华人民共和国取得它在联合国的合法地位，将会大大加强这个国际组织的威信。中华人民共和国的代表至今尚不能参加联合国及其机构的工作，这一情况是粗暴地破坏联合国宪章的原则的。
