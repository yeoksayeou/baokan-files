    Viciously Cursing the Communist Party and Trade Unions,
    Tu Yishan Subjected to Mass Criticism
    The People's Representatives of Xinyang City, Henan Province, recently held consecutive meetings to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Tu Yishan, Director of the Xinyang City Federation of Industry and Commerce and Deputy Mayor of Xinyang City. Tu Yishan once clamored that "fixed interest should be extended to one hundred years" and advised his son not to give up fixed interest in the future. He cursed the Communist Party as a "one-party dictatorship," saying that non-Party members cannot become officials now, and if they want to become officials, they can only be "deputy officials." He scolded the trade union as the "Green Gang," and the tax bureau and the commercial bureau as two whips over the heads of capitalists. He tried his best to exclude the Party member secretary of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and wanted to transfer the counter-revolutionary Li Yanmin to the Federation of Industry and Commerce as secretary.
    The people of Xinyang City are extremely angry at Tu Yishan's reactionary words and deeds, and unanimously expressed that they would launch a rational struggle against Tu Yishan.

    恶毒地咒骂共产党和工会
    涂义山受到群众批判
    河南信阳市全体人民代表最近连日举行会议揭发和批判信阳市工商联主任、信阳市副市长涂义山的反动言行。涂义山曾叫嚣“定息要延长到一百年”，并且劝他儿子将来也不要放弃定息。他咒骂共产党是“一党专政”，说现在不是党员不能做官，要做官也只能做“副官”。他骂工会是“青红帮”，骂税务局、商业局是资本家头上的两条鞭子。他竭力排斥工商联的党员秘书，想把反革命分子李燕敏调到工商联去当秘书。
    信阳市人民对涂义山的反动言行极为愤怒，一致表示要和涂义山展开说理斗争。
