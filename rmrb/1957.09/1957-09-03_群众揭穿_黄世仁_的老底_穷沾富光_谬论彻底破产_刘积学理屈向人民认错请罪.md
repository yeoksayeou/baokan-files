Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 2nd: Liu Jixue, Deputy Chairman of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and a rightist, admitted at the sixth meeting of the First Henan Provincial People's Congress on August 31st that, under the righteous and stern refutations of the people, he was "at the end of his rope and his true colors were exposed," and expressed that he would "bow his head and confess his guilt to the people."

Materials exposed in various symposiums over the past two months have proven that Liu Jixue, who served as the Speaker of the pseudo-Henan Provincial Assembly, has always been a political representative of the feudal landlord class. After liberation, he consistently slandered and vilified the Communist Party and its policies. At a meeting during the land reform, the first sentence of his draft speech was "Dear landlord compatriots!" He also insulted the emancipated peasants as "short-lived ghosts." During the Great Blooming and Contending, at a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, he put forward the extremely reactionary fallacy of "the poor benefit from the rich, and the rich benefit from heaven." He said that before liberation, the poor (mainly referring to poor peasants) could benefit from the "light" of the landlords. Now that the landlords have all fallen, the poor have no "light" to benefit from and are even poorer. He also tried his best to slander the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain.

Liu Jixue's reactionary remarks angered the people of Henan Province, especially the 500,000 farmers in his hometown of Xincai County. Many factories, agricultural cooperatives, schools, and government offices sent representatives to reason with Liu Jixue. More than 2,000 people in Xincai County wrote letters and articles to the "Henan Daily" and the "Xincai County Newspaper," or used other methods, to expose that Liu Jixue himself was a "Huang Shiren"-style evil landlord, and refuted his fallacy. Zhao Tianxiu, a farmhand who broke his back working for Liu Jixue, Xiao Yunxi, a maid whose experience was similar to "The White Haired Girl," Li Zhongzhen, whose wife was seized by Liu Jixue on the eve of their marriage, and Liu Caoshi, whose family was ruined by Liu Jixue's usury, all wrote letters to the "Xincai County Newspaper" and the "Henan Daily," explaining what "light" they had benefited from Liu Jixue in the past. Duan Lianyu worked as a farmhand for Liu Jixue for three years, plowing fifty mu of land alone, and was so tired every day that his back ached. He said: "I used my sweat to support Liu Jixue's family, but he didn't give me a penny, and finally, he kicked me out." Those who had been exploited by Liu Jixue's usury revealed that during the great famine in Henan in 1942, borrowing one dou of grain from Liu Jixue required repaying seven dou. Yang Puyu, a representative from Xinyang Prefecture (Xincai County is under Xinyang Prefecture), revealed at the People's Congress: "During the famine in 1942, of the seventy households in Li Jixue's hometown of Huangpo Village, more than sixty fled, and four families died out. Wang Gouzi's family starved to death seven members. That year, Liu Jixue robbed eighty-two mu of land from the peasants, and from the thirty shi of grain he lent to the peasants, he recovered two hundred and ten shi." People questioned Liu Jixue: How is this called "the poor benefit from the rich"?

Under the justified refutations of the broad masses of peasants and people's representatives, Liu Jixue had to admit that his "speech at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee was intentional and purposeful. It was intended to undermine the leadership of the Communist Party and weaken the leadership of the Communist Party, and to try to pull socialism back to capitalist or feudal society." Liu Jixue also mentioned the names of a group of peasants who had been persecuted by him, expressing his apology to them.

    群众揭穿“黄世仁”的老底  “穷沾富光”谬论彻底破产
    刘积学理屈向人民认错请罪
    据新华社郑州2日电  民革河南省委员会副主任委员、右派分子刘积学，8月31日在河南省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上承认：在大家义正词严的驳斥下，他已经“理屈词穷，真形毕露”，表示“向人民低头认罪”。
    两个月来，在各种座谈会上揭露的材料证明，当过伪河南省参议会议长的刘积学一直是一个封建大地主阶级的政治代表。解放后，他一直诋毁和诬蔑共产党和它制订的政策。在土地改革时的一次集会上，他在草拟的讲演稿中开头第一句就是“亲爱的地主同胞们！”他还辱骂翻身的农民是“短命鬼”。在大鸣大放期间，他在中共河南省委统战部召开的座谈会上，提出了反动透顶的“穷沾富光，富沾天光”的谬论。他说，解放前，穷人（主要指贫农）可以沾地主的“光”，现在地主都垮了，贫农无“光”可沾，就更穷了。他还竭力污蔑国家的粮食统购统销政策。
    刘积学的反动言论激怒了河南省的人民，特别是他家乡新蔡县的五十万农民。许多工厂、农业社、学校、机关等派代表和刘积学说理。新蔡县有二千多人给“河南日报”、“新蔡县报”写信、写文章或用其他方式，举出大量事实，来揭露刘积学本人就是一个“黄世仁”式的大恶霸地主，并且对他的谬论进行驳斥。给刘积学做工累断脊骨的长工赵天秀，遭遇类似“白毛女”的婢女小云喜，结婚前夕被刘积学霸占了妻子的李中真以及在刘积学的高利贷盘剥下家破人亡的刘曹氏都给“新蔡县报”、“河南日报”写信，说明他们过去究竟沾过刘积学什么“光”。农民段连玉给刘积学当过三年长工，一个人种五十亩地，整天累得腰酸骨头疼。他说：“我用血汗养活刘积学一家，他没有给我分文钱，最后，把我赶出去了。”受过刘积学高利贷剥削的人揭露，1942年河南大荒年时吃刘积学一斗粮食要还七斗。信阳专区（新蔡县属信阳专区）代表杨璞玉在人代会上揭露说：“就在1942年的灾荒中，刘积学家乡荒坡村共七十户人家，就外逃六十多户，死绝了四户，王狗子一家饿死七口。那一年，刘积学却从农民手中劫夺了八十二亩地，他借给农民的三十石粮，收回的却是二百一十石。”人们责问刘积学：这叫什么“穷沾富光”？
    在广大农民和人民代表们的据理驳斥下，刘积学不得不承认他“在省委统战部座谈会上的发言是有企图有目的的。是打算破坏共产党的领导和削弱共产党的领导，是企图把社会主义拉回到资本主义社会或封建社会”。刘积学还提到一群被他迫害过的农民的名字，表示向他们请罪。
