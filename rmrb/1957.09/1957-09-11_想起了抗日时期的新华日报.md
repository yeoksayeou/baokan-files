　　Remembering the Xinhua Daily during the Anti-Japanese War
　　Zhao Junhong
    Before going to work this morning, the People's Daily was delivered. White newsprint, two large sheets, still with the scent of ink. Recently, the newspaper has been filled with newly exposed vile words and deeds of right-wing elements. I thought, if the right-wing elements' conspiracy had succeeded, even a small matter like reading the newspaper would not be as free as it is now. This made me recall reading the Xinhua Daily in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War.
    After the Kuomintang government fled to Chongqing, it still passively resisted Japan and actively opposed the Communists. Fascist secret agents ran rampant, and corruption became the norm. At that time, if it weren't for the Xinhua Daily, run by the Communist Party, people probably wouldn't even have the courage to live on.
    Every morning, as soon as I opened my eyes, the Xinhua Daily had already been slipped in through the crack in the door. Seeing the victorious reports of the Hundred Regiments Offensive, the production and land reclamation movement, the deeds of heroes and model workers, the victories of the Soviet army..., I not only learned a lot of knowledge from it, but also added infinite hope for the future.
    At that time, Chongqing did not have white newsprint; only paper made of straw, which was yellow, thin, and easily torn, was used to print newspapers. Other newspapers were printed very poorly, but the Xinhua Daily was printed clearly and eye-catchingly, and it was published the earliest.
    Although the Xinhua Daily was publicly distributed, the secret agents still openly made things difficult for it everywhere. Every day, when a newspaper was delivered to a reader, it had to go through countless struggles.
    The boy who delivered the newspaper to me was about fourteen or fifteen years old. He always slipped the newspaper in through the crack in the door and left, and I rarely saw his face. I really wanted to talk to him, but he rarely spoke. One day, in the courtyard, I saw three people surrounding him, and I thought he might have offended someone! So I walked over. One person asked the boy, "Have you ever seen Zhou Enlai?" The boy said, "Yes." "What do you call him?" "Comrade." "What does he call you?" "Also comrade." One person then said, "The Communist Party just says nice things. Does Zhou Enlai eat with you?" The boy said, "I don't have time to talk nonsense with you. I have to deliver newspapers." After saying that, he wanted to leave, but they grabbed him and said, "No! You can't leave without answering." The boy said, "Of course we eat together." They asked again, "Since you are so equal, why doesn't Zhou Enlai come out to deliver newspapers? Why don't you do his job for two days?" The boy said, "Our political status is the same, but the division of labor is different. I only know how to deliver newspapers, and he has to do more complicated things. Why should he deliver newspapers?" The three people were stumped, but they still wouldn't let the newspaper delivery boy leave. I went over and pulled the boy out, watching him walk away with his newspaper bag, full of spirit.
    The secret agents did not give up any opportunity to disrupt the newspaper office. Once, a newspaper delivery boy fell ill with typhoid fever. The newspaper office sent the boy to the hospital for treatment. Later, the boy unfortunately died. The newspaper office paid for the funeral and held a memorial service. Afterwards, the secret agents went to the boy's father and said, "The Communist Party killed your son. You go to them and demand a person, or they have to pay money. Go, we'll support you!" The boy's father answered very bluntly, "It's a pity I don't have a son anymore. If I did, I would still send him to the newspaper office."
    Once, I was crossing the river in a wooden boat, and a boy delivering the Xinhua Daily was also on board. After the boat left, a person sitting next to the boy patted him on the shoulder and said, "Hey! Little Communist, the Communist Party practices communism of wives. Have you shared any yet?" After saying that, he laughed loudly, thinking he had asked a very witty question. The boy calmly said, "That's all talking about yourselves." The person saw that the boy actually dared to retort, so he grabbed the boy's arm and said, "Let's throw this little Communist into the river and drown him!" The child grabbed him with both hands and said, "Okay! Drown, you come down too!" This time, the guy let go of his hand instead. When the boat reached the shore, the guy grabbed the boy and said, "Let me check if you have any leaflets?" The boy forcefully shook off the hand pulling him and walked away without looking back.
    More than ten years have passed. Now, newspaper deliverers ride their bicycles freely to deliver newspapers, and newspaper readers don't have to worry about secret agents asking, "Why are you reading the Xinhua Daily?" But the right-wing elements insist on pulling our beautiful society back to the darkness of the past. Thinking of this, I angrily clenched the newspaper.

### 想起了抗日时期的新华日报

　　想起了抗日时期的新华日报
　　赵君红
    早晨还没去上班，人民日报就送来了。白报纸，两大张，还发散着油墨的香味。近来报上每天都有新揭露出来的右派分子的恶言丑行。我想要是右派分子的阴谋得逞的话，就是像看报这件小事也不会像现在这样自由吧。由此，我回想起在抗日战争时期在重庆看新华日报的事来了。
    国民党政府逃到重庆后，还是消极抗日、积极反共，法西斯特务横行、贪污腐化成风。当时要是没有共产党办的新华日报，恐怕人们连活下去的勇气都要没有了。
    每天早晨一睁眼，新华日报已从门缝塞进来了，看到百团大战的胜利报道、生产开荒的运动、英雄、劳模的事迹、苏军的胜利……，不但从中学得很多的知识，并且给未来增添了无限希望。
    那时，重庆没有白报纸，只有用稻草做的既黄且薄又易破的纸来印报。别的报纸都印得很糟，只有新华日报印得清晰醒目，并且出版的最早。
    新华日报虽是公开发行，但是特务们还是处处公开地和它为难，每天当一张报送到读者手中，不知要经过多少次斗争。
    给我送报的是个十四五岁的少年，他总是把报从门缝塞进来就走，很少能见到他的面，我很想和他谈谈，但是他总很少开口。有一天在院子里，看见有三个人围着他，我想他该不会惹着谁吧！于是就走了过去。一个人问这少年：“你见过周恩来吗？”少年说：“见过。”“你叫他什么？”“同志。”“他叫你什么？”“也是同志。”一个人又说：“共产党就是说的好听，周恩来跟你一块吃饭吗？”少年说：“我没工夫和你们胡扯，我要去送报了。”说完就想走，他们拉着他说：“不行！不回答不叫走。”这少年说：“当然在一块吃饭。”他们又问“你们既然这么平等，为什么周恩来不出来送报，你替他干两天呢？”少年说：“我们政治地位一样，分工可是不同的，我只会送报，他要干更复杂的事，为什么要他来送报呢？”那三个人被顶回去了，可是还不叫送报少年走。我过去把少年拉出来，看着他背着报兜，精神抖擞地走开了。
    特务们是不放弃任何机会来和报社捣乱的。有一次，一个送报的小孩患了伤寒病，报社送小孩到医院去治，后来小孩不幸死了，报社又出钱殡葬，还开了追悼会。事后特务去找小孩的父亲说：“共产党把你的儿子害死了，你找他们要人去，不赔人就得赔钱。你去，我们支持你！”小孩的父亲回答得很干脆：“可惜我没儿子了，要有，我还送他到报馆去。”
    有一次，我乘木船过江，一个送新华日报的小孩也在上边。开船后，坐在小孩旁边的一个人拍着小孩的肩膀说：“喂！小共产党，共产党共产共妻，你共到了没有？”说完哈哈大笑，觉得问得很俏皮。小孩不慌不忙说：“这都是说的你们自己。”那人看小孩居然敢还嘴，就抓住小孩的手臂说：“把这小共产党推到河里淹死吧！”孩子两手抓住他说：“好吧！淹死，你也下来吧！”这一来，那家伙反把手松开了。等船到了岸，那家伙拉着小孩说：“让我检查检查你有没有传单？”小孩用力摔开来拉他的手，就头也不回地走了。
    十多年过去了。现在，送报人骑着车子自由地送报，看报的人也不必担心特务来问：“你为什么要看新华日报？”了。右派分子却硬要把我们的美好社会再拉回到以前的黑暗中去，想到这里，我愤怒地捏紧了报纸。
