Socialist Ideological Education is Necessary
Sun Faxiang, Director of the Philosophy Teaching and Research Section, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics

After listening to the reports of Comrades Kang Sheng and Lu Dingyi, we fully agree with the measures taken by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of Higher Education, and other departments to offer a course on "Socialist Ideological Education." The experience of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle has made us realize that offering the course "Socialist Ideological Education" is an important link in promoting the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and an important step in transforming bourgeois intellectuals into working-class intellectuals. This brilliant measure will be a "timely rain" for the intellectuals in institutions of higher learning who have experienced a great storm.

The socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, which began with the anti-Rightist struggle, has had a more extensive and profound impact on intellectuals than the socialist revolution on the economic front. This struggle has tested everyone and has given us many valuable experiences and lessons.

Before this struggle, many people had a superficial understanding of the laws of class struggle, and were not clear that after the victory of class struggle on the economic front, class struggle would still be sharply reflected in the political and ideological fields. Although they knew that there would be struggle in this area, they thought it would be long-term and local, and generally would not turn into major issues of right and wrong. Precisely because of this kind of wrong understanding, we could not study the real situation of class struggle well, and could not effectively carry out class education. Once major issues of right and wrong were placed before us, we were somewhat surprised, speechless, wavering, and even doubted that the anti-Rightist struggle was a class struggle of life and death. Our understanding could not keep up with the development of the situation, which affected the progress of the anti-Rightist struggle. This should be considered a lesson learned.

Before this struggle, many people thought that they had passed many "tests" and that there should be no problem with their stand. They thought that others had also passed the tests and that there were probably no problems with them either. However, when the Rightists launched their covert attacks against the Party, conspired to seize the leadership of institutions of higher learning, and clamored for "professors governing the schools," "democratic governance of the schools," "the Party committee withdrawing from the schools after the formation of democratic forces," "separation of the three powers of teaching, administration, and politics," and "laymen cannot lead experts," they did not realize that this was a struggle related to the direction of the development of higher education. Even after reactionary remarks such as "the Party's world," "political design institute," "rehabilitation committee," and "the proletarian dictatorship is the root of sectarianism" appeared, they remained indifferent, and even looked for "positive factors" in them. What was even worse was that even after the People's Daily discussed the issue of stand twice, some people still did not think it was important. They seemed to understand the minor rights and wrongs in ordinary times, but they became confused when faced with major rights and wrongs. What is this if not a problem of stand! This weakness was exploited by the Rightists, which should be considered another lesson learned.

Before this struggle, most people were studying Marxism-Leninism, but many had not really understood why they should study Marxism-Leninism, and did not understand how to learn the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method. Therefore, there were problems and shortcomings in their learning attitude and learning effectiveness. The Rightists took the opportunity to wield the cudgel of "anti-dogmatism," attempting to overthrow the theoretical foundation that guides our thinking—Marxism-Leninism—and restore bourgeois social science. They wanted people to be "liberated" from the "shackles" of Marxism-Leninism, and wanted people to "think independently." Some people, leaving the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method, "thought independently" and ended up falling into the trap of the Rightists and being led by the nose by them. Not seriously studying Marxism-Leninism, not learning the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method is equivalent to having no soul, not being able to transform oneself, and even less being able to serve socialism well, let alone being an engineer of the human soul. This should be considered yet another lesson learned.

Before this struggle, the petty-bourgeois kingdom deep in the souls of many intellectuals had not been greatly touched. They were still very unaccustomed to connecting with reality and integrating with workers and peasants, and were very interested in their own small world. Some had one book of dogma, some had one thesis of dogma, and some were focused on doing work that would "make a name for themselves." The Rightists also took advantage of this weakness, pretending to "care for" and "protect" intellectuals, shouting slogans such as "one room, two books," "one pack of cigarettes, two cups of tea," calling for "expertise first, then redness," and complaining that the Communist Party "does not understand the laws of intellectuals," plotting to pull intellectuals over to their side. Now it is very clear that they were not protecting intellectuals at all, but were clearly trying to poison them. It is clear that the law for intellectuals now is to integrate with workers and peasants, serve workers and peasants, and transform themselves into working-class intellectuals. However, the Rightists insisted on separating intellectuals from politics and from workers and peasants, plunging them into the mire of selfishness and being used by the bourgeoisie. The environment and conditions have changed, and the laws have also changed. The Rightists wanted intellectuals to become outcasts of the times and be buried with them. How vicious their means were! This should also be considered a lesson learned.

Similar lessons can be summarized further. The basic lesson that the broad masses of intellectuals have learned in this struggle is that it is necessary to destroy capitalism and establish socialism in politics and ideology. As the saying goes, "no destruction, no construction," that is what it means. To achieve this, carrying out socialist ideological education becomes essential.

It can be affirmed that intellectuals absolutely need to take the "Socialist Ideological Education" course. This course will be a new driving force for us on the road to serving the socialist cause and transforming ourselves into working-class intellectuals.

    社会主义思想教育是必需的
    北京航空学院哲学教研室主任　孙发祥
    听了康生同志、陆定一同志的报告，我们完全赞成中共中央宣传部、高等教育部等各方面关于开设“社会主义思想教育”课程的措施。整风和反右派斗争的经验使我们认识到开设“社会主义思想教育”课程是推进政治上思想上社会主义革命的重要环节，是把资产阶级知识分子改造成为一个工人阶级知识分子的重要步骤。这一英明的措施，对于经历了一场大风浪的高等学校的知识分子说来将是一场“及时雨”。
    由反右派斗争开始的这一场政治、思想战线上的社会主义革命，对于知识分子较之经济战线上的社会主义革命的影响显得更加广泛和深刻，这场斗争考验了每个人，使我们获得了许多宝贵的经验教训。
    在这场斗争之前，很多人对于阶级斗争的规律了解的很肤浅，不清楚在经济战线上阶级斗争胜利之后，阶级斗争还会在政治、思想领域里尖锐地反映出来，虽然知道这方面会有斗争，但认为是长期的、局部的，一般的不会闹成大是非。正是由于这样一种错误的认识，使我们不能很好地去研究阶级斗争的现实情况，不能有效地进行阶级教育。一旦大是大非摆在面前就有些出乎意外、张口结舌、动摇不定，甚至怀疑反右派斗争是一场生死存亡的阶级斗争。认识赶不上形势的发展，影响了反右派斗争的进展，这要算是一条经验教训。
    在这场斗争之前，不少人自以为许多“关”都过来了，自己的立场该没什么问题了，别人也同样过来了，大概也都没什么问题了。其实不然，当右派分子放出暗箭攻击党，阴谋夺取高等学校的领导权，要搞什么“教授治校”、“民主治校”、“民主力量形成后党委退出学校”、“教学、行政、政治三权分立”、“外行不能领导内行”等等叫嚣时，竟觉察不到这是一个关系到高等教育发展方向的斗争，甚至在“党天下”、“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”、“无产阶级专政是宗派主义的根源”等等反动言论出现后仍然无动于衷，还在其中寻找什么“积极因素”，更甚的是，在人民日报两次论述立场问题之后，有人还不以为然，他们在平常的小是小非上看来倒还明白，遇到大是大非却糊涂起来。这不是立场问题是什么！这个弱点正好被右派分子利用了，这要算是另一条经验教训。
    在这场斗争之前，绝大多数人都在学习马克思列宁主义，但是不少人还没有真正了解为什么要学习马克思列宁主义，不懂得怎样学习无产阶级的立场、观点、方法，因此，在学习态度、学习效果上存在着问题和缺点。右派分子趁机抡起 “反教条主义”的棍子，企图把指导我们思想的理论基础——马克思列宁主义打翻，让资产阶级的社会科学复辟。他们要人们从马克思列宁主义的“束缚”下“解放”出来，要人们“独立思考”。一些人离开了无产阶级的立场、观点、方法 “独立思考”的结果是上了右派的圈套，被右派牵着鼻子走。不认真学习马克思列宁主义，不学习无产阶级的立场、观点、方法就等于没有灵魂，就不能改造自己，更不能很好地为社会主义服务，更谈不上作一个人类灵魂的工程师。这要算是又一条经验教训。
    在这场斗争之前，不少知识分子灵魂深处的小资产阶级的王国并没有受到很大的触动，他们对于联系实际、结合工农还很不习惯，对于自己那个小天地倒很感兴趣，有人有一本书主义，有人有一篇论文主义，有人则一心埋头干那种“一鸣惊人”的工作。右派分子也利用了人们的这个弱点，他们装着“关心”“保护”知识分子的样子，喊什么“一间房、两本书”、“一盒烟、两杯茶”，叫什么“先专后红”，抱怨共产党“不了解知识分子的规律”，阴谋把知识分子拉向他们那边去。现在看来是很清楚了，他们那里是保护知识分子，分明是要毒害知识分子，明明现在知识分子的规律是要与工农相结合，为工农服务，把自己改造成工人阶级的知识分子。右派却硬让知识分子脱离政治，脱离工农，陷入自私自利的泥坑中为资产阶级所利用。环境、条件变了，规律也跟着变了，右派要知识分子去作一个时代的落伍者，去与他们一同殉葬的手段该是多么恶毒啊！这也算是一条经验教训。
    像这样的经验教训，还可以总结出一些来。广大知识分子在这场斗争中所得到的一个基本的经验教训就是要在政治上思想上破资本主义，立社会主义。俗话说“不破不立”就是这个意思。要作到这一点，进行社会主义思想教育就成为必不可少的事情了。
    可以肯定的说，知识分子绝对地需要上“社会主义思想教育”这一课。这一课将是我们在为社会主义事业和将自己改造成工人阶级知识分子的前进道路上的新的推动力。
