Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 10th: The Indian Council of States' debate on foreign policy on the 9th showed that India is extremely concerned about the Middle East situation. Speakers also fiercely criticized US military aid to the Middle East and Pakistan.

Nehru, speaking at the start of the debate in the morning, expressed regret over the provision of military assistance to Arab countries by some major powers. He said: "Tanks are now being flown in from anywhere in Europe that has a stockpile of tanks, and from the United States itself."

Nehru pointed out: "The Soviet Union must be allowed to participate in solving the Middle East question, just as China must be allowed to participate in solving the Far East question." He also warned that the situation in Syria is fraught with danger "if wrong steps are taken."

Nehru said that India would not support any "condemnation proposal" or a proposal to "deny" Hungary's representation in the United Nations if it was raised at the United Nations General Assembly regarding the Hungarian question.

Nehru also said that the "substantial" US military aid to Pakistan was of great concern to India and placed a burden on India in terms of military spending. Nehru said that this aid was a threat to India.

Members of parliament from various parties who spoke in the Council of States generally supported Nehru's speech. The afternoon debate seemed to shift to dissatisfaction with the Eisenhower Doctrine. Anup Singh, a member of parliament who recently visited Arab countries, pointed out that what threatens the Middle East countries is not communism, but the Eisenhower Doctrine.

　　尼赫鲁指出叙利亚局势充满危险
　　不能够不让苏联参加解决中东问题
    据新华社新德里10日电　印度联邦院9日的外交问题辩论说明印度对中东局势极为忧虑。发言的人并且对美国给中东和巴基斯坦的军事援助提出了激烈批评。
    尼赫鲁在上午辩论开始时发言，对于一些大国给予阿拉伯国家军火援助表示遗憾。他说：“现在正在从欧洲任何贮有坦克的地方，并且从美国本身用飞机运去坦克。”
    尼赫鲁指出：“不能不让苏联参加解决中东问题，正如不能不让中国参加解决远东问题一样。”他还警告说，“要是采取了错误步骤的话”，叙利亚局势是充满着危险的。
    尼赫鲁说，在联合国大会上如果就匈牙利问题提出任何“谴责提案”或者“否认”匈牙利在联合国的代表权的提案，印度都不会予以支持。
    尼赫鲁又说，美国给巴基斯坦的“大量”军事援助使得印度极为担忧，并且使印度在军备开支方面承受负担。尼赫鲁说，这种援助是对印度的威胁。
    在联邦院中发言的各党派议员普遍支持尼赫鲁的发言。下午的辩论似乎转入对艾森豪威尔主义的不满。最近访问了阿拉伯国家的议员阿努普·辛格指出，威胁中东国家的不是共产主义，而是艾森豪威尔主义。
