Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Over 800,000 farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are undergoing a profound socialist education. Currently, agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs have universally convened meetings to mobilize the masses to speak out freely. In the eight pilot townships where this process started earlier, after seventeen days of free airing of views, the masses are now engaged in extensive debates.

The socialist education movement in the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs began in mid-August, initially in eight pilot townships. The vast majority of farmers actively participated in this movement, with approximately 90% of households having someone attending meetings and 70% expressing their opinions. They freely discussed their views on agricultural cooperativization, unified purchase and sale, cadre work style, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and adherence to the legal system. According to statistics from Dongran Village, Zhao Xindian, and three other townships, the masses from all strata put forward more than 11,600 opinions, the vast majority of which were well-intentioned criticisms and constructive suggestions. These opinions were welcomed by township and commune cadres, who have already begun to improve their work.

In the eight townships where debates have already begun, the focus of the debate is mainly on agricultural cooperativization and unified purchase and sale. The overwhelming majority of poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely defend the path of cooperativization. They said that when they first joined the cooperative, they could not afford the membership shares and faced financial difficulties, so they took out loans from the credit cooperative. After two or three years of membership, they paid off their shares and loans, and their lives improved year by year according to the principle of distribution according to work. Others said that after joining the cooperative, they no longer had to worry about food and clothing, many people built new houses, and more people were able to read and write. Joining the cooperative was like a second liberation, and they would never again suffer from hunger and poverty. However, a small number of upper-middle peasants, especially those who used to hire laborers or engage in commercial speculation, believed that "agricultural cooperativization has no superiority" and that "grain should not be rationed; it should be eaten and bought freely." Su Desheng, an upper-middle peasant member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, often verbally abused cadres and the government, believing that "joining the cooperative is like entering a snail shell courtyard" (meaning embarking on a dead end). At the debate, many farmers revealed his true intentions. Poor peasant Wang Baoshan said: "When you were working individually, you cultivated forty-two mu of land, had mules and carts, and often hired laborers. After joining the cooperative, you haven't been working hard in the cooperative, always wanting to take the capitalist road, so you think joining the cooperative is like entering a snail shell courtyard." Members of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Xihongmen Township used a large number of facts to refute the absurd claim spread by some people that "agricultural cooperatives harm the country and the people." Cooperative member Yang Shuzhen said: "In the past, the water in our township could not be drained, and the loess pit in the west of the village was a low-lying area that yielded nothing in nine out of ten years. Only after cooperativization was a large canal dug, which not only solved the drainage problem but also reclaimed more than 100 mu of paddy fields. Can this be said to harm the country and the people?" In refuting the remarks slandering the unified purchase and sale policy, many farmers used facts to show that the unified purchase and sale of grain stabilized grain prices and ensured the farmers' rations. Ding Liangshi, a poor peasant in Machi Township, said: "The government's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is to deal with speculators. With unified purchase and sale, no one can hoard and speculate." After the debate, many people felt that their "minds were clear and their vision was bright."

In accordance with the principle of rectifying while correcting, the township and commune leaders in the suburbs of Beijing analyzed and studied the opinions raised by the farmers. Some townships and communes have already begun to improve their work. Members of the Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative suggested that the accounts of the agricultural cooperative and production teams should be made public to the members. The cooperative management committee has decided to rectify the accounts and convene a meeting of brigade representatives to disclose them in detail. Members of the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative pointed out that the warehouse was disorganized, making it difficult to find things and affecting production. The cooperative immediately organized a dozen people to clean up the warehouse and organize the stored items in an orderly manner. The electric mill of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative could not meet the needs of the members for grinding grain. Now the cooperative has decided to draw thirty-eight donkeys from the cart team to grind grain for the members and to change the electric mill to a "three-shift system" to improve its efficiency. Some farmers in Liulitun Township pointed out that the business hours of the supply and marketing cooperative and the grain supply station coincided with the farmers' production time, and they were closed when the farmers were resting, making it inconvenient to buy things. After the township discussed the matter with the relevant departments, they have now adjusted their business hours. Many township and commune cadres accepted the criticism of the masses in this movement and expressed their willingness to earnestly improve their work style. The initial improvements in the work of the townships and communes have been welcomed by the farmers. They believe that their opinions were not raised in vain and that problems were truly being solved.

Currently, farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are engaged in intensive autumn harvesting work during the day, and continue to hold meetings for free airing of views and debates during their rest time at night, so as to ensure that both socialist education and production are carried out without hindrance.

　　北京郊区农民大鸣大放
　　污蔑农业合作化和统购统销政策的谬论受到群众批驳
　　乡和社的工作在群众的帮助下逐步改进
    新华社18日讯　北京市郊区八十多万农民正在经历一次深刻的社会主义教育。现在，郊区的农业社已经普遍召开会议，发动群众大鸣大放。在进行较早的八个试点乡里，经过十七天大鸣大放后，群众正在展开大辩论。
    北京市郊区农村社会主义教育运动是8月中旬首先在八个试点乡开始的。广大农民积极参加了这一运动，有90％左右的农户都有人参加会议，70％的人发表了意见。他们就农业合作化、统购统销、干部作风、肃反和遵守法制等问题，畅谈了自己的意见。仅据东冉村、赵辛店等五个乡的统计，各阶层群众共提出一万一千六百多条意见，其中绝大多数是善意的批评和正确的建议。这些意见受到乡、社干部的欢迎，他们已经着手改进工作。
    在已经开始辩论的八个乡中，辩论的焦点主要集中在农业合作化和统购统销问题上。绝大多数贫农和下中农坚决维护走合作化的道路。他们说，刚入社时，入社股金交不上，生活困难，在信用社贷了款；入社两三年后，股金交齐了，贷款还清了，按劳取酬，生活一年比一年好。还有人说，入社后吃穿不愁了，很多人盖了新房子，念书识字的人也多了；入社是第二次翻身，再不挨饿受穷了。但是，也有少数上中农特别是过去经常雇工或搞商业投机的人，认为“农业合作化没有优越性”，“粮食不应当限量，应该随便吃、随便买”。中苏友好农业社上中农社员苏德生经常辱骂干部和政府，认为“入社是进了螺蛳大院”（意思是走上了死路）。在辩论会上，许多农民道破了他的真实目的。贫农王宝山说：“单干时，你种了四十二亩地，有骡子、大车，经常雇工；入社以后，你一直不好好在社里干活，老是想走资本主义道路，所以你才认为入社是进了螺蛳大院。”西红门乡曙光农业社社员用大量事实批驳了有些人散布的“农业社坑国害民”的荒谬说法。社员杨淑珍说：“过去我们乡里的积水排不出去，村西黄土坑是十年九不收的洼地。只有合作化以后才挖了大水渠，不光解决了排水问题，还开垦了一百多亩稻田，这能说坑国害民吗？”在批驳污蔑统购统销政策的言论中，许多农民用事实说明粮食统购统销后稳定了粮价，保证了农民的口粮。马池乡贫农丁梁氏说：“政府的粮食统购统销政策是治投机倒把的人；有了统购统销，谁想囤积倒把都不成了”。经过辩论，许多人觉得“头脑清醒、心明眼亮了”。
    根据边整边改的精神，北京市郊区的乡、社领导干部对农民提出的意见，进行了分析研究。有的乡、社已经初步改进了工作。丰收农社社员提出应当向社员公布农业社和生产队的账目，社务管理委员会已经决定整顿账目，召开大队代表会议，详细公布。星火农业社社员提出仓库混乱，找东西困难，影响生产。这个社立刻组织十几个人清理仓库，把库里存放的东西整理得井井有条。中苏友好农业社的电磨不能满足社员碾粮的需要，现在社里决定从大车队抽出三十八头驴给社员推磨，并且把电磨改成“三班制”，提高使用效率。六里屯乡有些农民提出，供销社和粮食供应站的营业时间恰好是农民的生产时间，农民休息它们也休息，买东西不方便；经过乡里同有关部门研究以后，现在它们已经调整了营业时间。许多乡、社干部在这次运动当中接受了群众的批评，并且表示要认真改进作风。各乡、社初步改进工作后，受到了农民的欢迎。他们认为，意见没有白提，真解决问题。
    目前，北京市郊区农民白天正在进行紧张的秋收工作，晚上休息时间继续开会鸣放和辩论，做到开展社会主义教育和生产两不误。
