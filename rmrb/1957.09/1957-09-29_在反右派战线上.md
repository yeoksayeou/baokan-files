　　On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　Zhang Yunhu and Jin Ruiyang's Absurd Arguments Bankrupt
　　Zhang Yunhu and Jin Ruiyang, two responsible editors and rightist elements in the news department of Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, used the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to unite and compete for leadership of the radio station. They manipulated the free-airing forum, attempting to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership of the radio station by completely negating the radio station's achievements. They slandered the newspaper, saying it "used non-Party reporters like cattle and horses," and that Party leaders "rely on seniority and repeat propaganda directives." At the same time, they secretly plotted and formulated concrete strategies to win over one radio station leader, attack another leader, divide the leadership core, peel off layers of support, and win over Party members for "uprising" in order to attack the Party. These two rightist elements have now been exposed and criticized.

　　Wang Yu's Anti-Party Letter of Suggestion
　　Workers of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration have exposed Wang Yu, a rightist element within the Party. Wang Yu is the chief engineer of oil refining in the Production Technology Department of the Administration. He once wrote a letter of suggestion to the Party Central Committee, slandering that China has no rule of law, is a feudal dynasty, and is not even as good as capitalist countries. He cursed high-ranking Party cadres as "aristocrats in national life." He openly spoke out for Hu Feng, clamoring that legal sanctions should be implemented against security cadres in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He spread a large amount of imperialist theories and bourgeois revisionist ideas in his letter of suggestion.

　　Zhang Chaojie's Anti-Party Words and Deeds Exposed
　　Staff members of the Shanghai Youth Daily are conducting a reasoning struggle against Zhang Chaojie, the deputy leader of the newspaper's political group and a rightist element within the Party. This rightist element clamored to open a gap from the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, slandering that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is sectarianism, aimed at rectifying one group of people and promoting another group." In the newspaper, he organized an anti-Party small clique, put on a rival show to the rectification leadership group that correctly implemented the central government's policies, advocated settling old scores, incited the promotion of great democracy, and at the same time proposed "reelecting the editorial board, free association, managing the newspaper by colleagues" and "abolishing the Party newspaper." They once turned the Youth Daily into a miasma.

    上海人民广播电台新闻部的两个责任编辑、右派分子张云鹄、金瑞晹，利用共产党整风机会，联合起来争夺电台领导权，他们操纵鸣放座谈会，以全盘否定电台工作成绩来企图推翻共产党对电台的领导。他诬蔑报社“把非党记者像牛马一样地使用”，党员领导人“靠资格吃饭，靠宣传指示把口”，同时他们还进行密商，制订了争取电台的一个领导人、打击另一领导人，分化领导核心，层层下剥，争取党员“起义”等向党进攻的具体策略。现在这两个右派分子已经受到揭发和批判。
    王禹的一封反党建议书
    新疆石油管理局职工揭发出党内右派分子王禹。王禹是该局生产技术处炼油主任工程师。他曾经向党中央写了一封建议书，污蔑我国没有法制，是封建王朝，连资本主义国家都比不上。他咒骂党的高级干部是“国家生活中的贵族”。他公然替胡风喊冤，叫嚣对肃反中的保卫干部应该实行法律制裁。他在建议书中大量散布帝国主义的理论和资产阶级修正主义的思想。
    张朝杰反党言行受到揭发
    上海青年报工作人员正对该报政治组副组长、党内右派分子张朝杰，进行说理斗争。这个右派分子叫嚣要从肃反打开一个缺口，污蔑“肃反是宗派主义，是为了整一批人、抬一批人”。在报社，他组织了反党的小集团，和正确贯彻中央方针的整风领导小组唱对台戏，主张算旧账，煽动搞大民主，同时提出“改选编委会，自由结合，同人办报”，“取消机关报”，他们一度把青年报搞得乌烟瘴气。
