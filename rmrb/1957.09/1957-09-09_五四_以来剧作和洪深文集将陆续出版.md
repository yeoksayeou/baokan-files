To inherit and promote the combat tradition of the Chinese spoken drama movement's fiftieth anniversary this year, the China Drama Publishing House will successively publish many excellent plays written by Chinese writers since the "May Fourth" Movement that have stood the test of time on the stage. Already published are "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" (by Xia Yan), "Thunderstorm" (by Cao Yu), "Qu Yuan" (by Guo Moruo), "Officialdom Unveiled" (by Chen Baichen), "Fog Over Chongqing" (by Song Zhi's), "Night Shanghai" (by Yu Ling), etc. Forthcoming publications include "The Peach Blossom Fan" (by Ouyang Yuqian), "Death of a Famous Actor" (by Tian Han), "Sunrise" (by Cao Yu), "Bi Xue Hua" [Crimson Blood Flower] (by A Ying), "The Tiger Tally" (by Guo Moruo), etc.

Many important plays by the late Hong Shen, one of the founders of Chinese spoken drama and a famous dramatist, such as "Zhao Yanwang," "Wang Kuichiao," "Fragrant Rice," "Green Dragon Pool," "Bao Dehang," "The Cock Crows Early to See the Sky," "Woman, Woman," "Smuggling," "Salted Fish-ism," "The Flying General," and more than ten other plays, are included in the first and second volumes of the "Collected Works of Hong Shen," which will also be published in September and October. The "Collected Works of Hong Shen" consists of four volumes, totaling approximately 1.5 million words, and includes the author's posthumous portrait, reproduced manuscripts, and a bibliography of his works. The third and fourth volumes are essays and are still being edited, with plans to have them all published in the first quarter of next year.
