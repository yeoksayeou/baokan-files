　　Another Shameful Resolution

　　After several days of discussion, the United Nations General Assembly Special Session, disregarding the opposition of world justice and public opinion, finally illegally passed the so-called resolution on the "Hungarian question" under the manipulation of the United States. This resolution did not bring any glory to the United Nations, but instead left another shameful mark on the more than ten-year history of the United Nations organization's existence. This action taken by the United Nations General Assembly Special Session shows that the United Nations, which should be the maintainer of world justice and peace, has once again acted as a tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. This cannot but arouse great indignation among all conscientious people who love justice and cherish the cause of international cooperation.

　　Although the United States used its voting machine in the United Nations to pass the so-called shameful resolution "condemning" the Soviet Union, this does not give the resolution any legal nature. The basis for the discussion at this special session of the General Assembly was the report of the so-called Five-Member Committee, and as everyone knows, this so-called Five-Member Committee was established in accordance with the illegal resolution of the previous General Assembly, and therefore the so-called committee itself is illegal. At the same time, facts have proved that the committee's report was compiled based on the lies fabricated by those enemies of the Hungarian people, including counter-revolutionaries, traitors, and imperialist spies. It is a document of complete slander and therefore has no factual basis or moral value. Since the resolution of the Special Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is based on lengthy lies, it can of course only be a piece of empty paper that cannot play any role.

　　The main content of the resolution of the General Assembly Special Session is to extremely distort the nature of the Hungarian incident and the domestic political situation in Hungary, and to slander and smear the just actions of the Soviet Union. However, a small cloud can never cover the bright sunshine. The two white papers published by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, as well as the large amount of materials cited by newspapers and periodicals in many countries, have irrefutably proved that the Hungarian incident was a planned and prepared counter-revolutionary armed rebellion carried out by Hungarian counter-revolutionaries with the instigation and support of the imperialist bloc. Its purpose was to restore the rule of capitalism and fascism in Hungary, and to attempt to turn Hungary, located in the heart of Europe, into an aggressive base for imperialism against the Soviet Union and communism. To call such an incident a so-called "spontaneous" "national uprising" is a complete reversal of black and white and a distortion of facts. In addition, the actions of the Soviet army that came to the aid of the Hungarian people at the active request of the legitimate Hungarian government and in accordance with effective international treaties and agreements are not only a full embodiment of the great spirit of internationalism, but also a just act to defend the cause of peace in Europe and the world. This behavior has been appreciated by the Hungarian people and praised by many honest people internationally. The imperialist bloc's malicious attacks on this open and aboveboard behavior precisely show that this behavior is detrimental to imperialism's sinister aggressive conspiracy, and beneficial to the cause of world peace and human progress.

　　The situation in Hungary has long been normal and stable. The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has long been effectively and fully exercising the power to govern state affairs, and has been supported by the broad masses of Hungarian working people. The friendly relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union have also been further strengthened and consolidated on the basis of equality and mutual assistance. Under these circumstances, it is extremely absurd for the United States to manipulate the United Nations Special Session to pass this illegal resolution. In addition to arousing the indignation of all peace-loving and justice-loving people, it cannot have any impact on Hungary.

　　However, why is the United States making a big fuss about the so-called "Hungarian question" on the eve of the 12th United Nations General Assembly? Why is it necessary to hold a special session to discuss and pass this shameful resolution that interferes in Hungary's internal affairs? The United States' intentions are very sinister. On the one hand, the United States is not reconciled to the failure of its counter-revolutionary adventure in Hungary and attempts to use the United Nations to continue to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. On the other hand, the United States attempts to use this to instigate anti-Soviet and anti-communist hostile propaganda, exacerbate international tensions, and divert world public opinion from the recent intensification of aggressive activities by the United States in the Middle East and the obstruction of disarmament negotiations. The United States also attempts to use this to poison the atmosphere of the upcoming United Nations General Assembly and prevent the United Nations General Assembly from normally discussing and resolving current major and urgent international issues.

　　The Chinese people express extreme contempt for this illegal resolution passed by the United Nations Special Session under the manipulation of the United States, and express great indignation at the United States' deliberate interference in Hungary's internal affairs and its actions to exacerbate international tensions. In order to uphold justice and safeguard the sacred principles of the United Nations Charter, we resolutely demand that the United Nations revoke this shameful resolution that interferes in Hungary's internal affairs, and condemn the United States' sinful act of stirring up trouble, poisoning the international atmosphere, and undermining peace.

### 又一个可耻决议

　　又一个可耻决议
    联合国大会特别会议经过几天的讨论，不顾世界正义舆论的反对，终于在美国的操纵下非法地通过了所谓关于“匈牙利问题”的决议。这个决议没有给联合国带来任何光彩，却反而在联合国组织存在的十多年历史上又一次留下了一个可耻的烙印。联合国大会特别会议所采取的这一行动表明，理应作为世界正义与和平事业维护者的联合国，却又一次充当了美国干涉他国内政的工具。这不能不引起一切有良心的热爱正义与珍视国际合作事业的人们的极大愤慨。
    尽管美国运用它在联合国的表决机器通过了所谓“谴责”苏联的可耻决议。但是这并不能够使这个决议具有丝毫合法的性质。这次联大特别会议讨论的根据是所谓五人委员会的报告，而尽人皆知，这个所谓五人委员会是根据上届联大非法决议成立的，因此这个所谓委员会本身就是非法的。同时，事实已经证明，这个委员会的报告是根据那些匈牙利人民的公敌，包括反革命分子，叛国罪犯，帝国主义间谍特务所捏造的谎言而编制出来的。它是一个彻头彻尾造谣诽谤的文件，因而没有任何事实根据和道义价值。既然联合国大会特别委员会决议所根据的是连篇累牍的谎言，它当然只能是起不了任何作用的一纸空文而已。
    联大特别会议决议的主要内容，是对匈牙利事件的性质和匈牙利国内的政治情况进行极端歪曲，并对苏联的正义行动进行诽谤诬蔑。但是，一小朵乌云是决不能掩盖住灿烂明朗的阳光的。匈牙利工农革命政府所发表的两次白皮书，以及许多国家的报刊所引证的大量材料，都已无可辩驳地证明：匈牙利事件是匈牙利反革命分子在帝国主义集团策动和支持之下进行的、有计划有准备的反革命武装暴乱。它的目的是为了使资本主义和法西斯主义的统治在匈牙利复辟，并且企图把地处欧洲心脏的匈牙利重新变为帝国主义反苏反共的一个侵略基地。把这样的事件称作所谓“自发的”“民族起义，完全是故意颠倒黑白，歪曲事实。此外，根据匈牙利合法政府的主动请求，和有效的国际条约与协定而驰援匈牙利人民的苏联军队的行动，不但是伟大国际主义精神的充分体现，而且也是保卫欧洲与世界和平事业的正义行为。这种行为已经受到了匈牙利人民的感激和国际上许多正直人士的赞扬。帝国主义集团对这种光明正大的行为进行恶毒的攻击，恰恰说明这种行为是不利于帝国主义心怀叵测的侵略阴谋的，而有利于世界和平和人类进步事业的。
    匈牙利局势早已正常稳定了。匈牙利工农革命政府早已有效地充分地在行使着治理国家事务的权力，并且得到了匈牙利广大劳动人民的拥护与支持。匈牙利和苏联两国之间的友好关系，在平等互助的基础上也有了进一步的加强和巩固。在这种情况之下，美国操纵联合国特别会议通过这一非法决议，是极端荒谬的。它除引起一切爱好和平和崇尚正义的人们的愤慨以外，对匈牙利是不能发生任何影响的。
    但是，在第十二届联合国大会召开前夕，为什么美国要在所谓“匈牙利问题”上大作文章呢？为什么硬要举行特别会议来讨论和通过这一干涉匈牙利内政的可耻决议呢？美国的用心是十分险恶的。一方面，美国不甘心于在匈牙利进行反革命冒险的失败，企图利用联合国继续干涉匈牙利的内政。另一方面，美国企图借此策动反苏反共的敌意宣传，加剧国际紧张局势，以转移世界舆论对最近美国在中东加紧侵略活动和阻挠裁军谈判的注意。美国同时也企图借此毒化即将开幕的联合国大会的气氛，阻挠联合国大会正常地讨论和解决当前重大而迫切的国际问题。
    中国人民对美国操纵联合国特别会议通过的这一非法决议，表示极度蔑视，对美国处心积虑地干涉匈牙利内政和加剧国际紧张局势的行为，表示万分愤慨。为了伸张正义，为了维护联合国宪章的神圣原则，我们坚决要求联合国撤销这一干涉匈牙利内政的可耻决议，并谴责美国兴风作浪地毒化国际气氛和破坏和平的罪恶勾当。
