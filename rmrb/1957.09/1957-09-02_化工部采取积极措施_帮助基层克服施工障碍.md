The Ministry of Chemical Industry Takes Active Measures
    To Help Grassroots Overcome Construction Obstacles

    (Our report) The Ministry of Chemical Industry is actively taking various measures to strive to complete this year's basic construction plan.

    The progress of basic construction of the Ministry of Chemical Industry in the first half of this year was relatively slow. By the end of June, only 29.3% of the annual plan had been completed. Completing about 70% of the annual plan in the next six months is a rather arduous task. In view of the above situation, the Ministry of Chemical Industry recently issued an emergency instruction to its affiliated units, requiring all relevant units to make every effort to complete this year's basic construction tasks. The instructions require that the heads of each basic construction unit should personally re-adjust and balance this year's basic construction plan appropriately in accordance with the spirit of being active, steady, and reliable. Parties A and B should cooperate better, and all relevant departments should make the greatest efforts to do a good job in the supply of various materials.

    Prior to this, the Ministry of Chemical Industry had sent working groups headed by directors and deputy directors to key construction areas such as Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and Jilin to assist the affiliated basic construction units in inspecting work and solving problems. The working group that went to Lanzhou solved the long-delayed problem of uncoordinated work between Parties A and B by convening a meeting for the leaders of both parties to negotiate, and basically solved the problem of insufficient raw materials.

    Since entering August, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has held a series of basic construction meetings in North China, Northeast China, and East China, and then conducted a general balance in Beijing. Through this series of work, the problems of material shortages or specifications not meeting the needs that existed in some areas in the past have been basically resolved.

    化工部采取积极措施
    帮助基层克服施工障碍
    本报讯  化学工业部积极采取各种措施，力争完成今年的基本建设计划。
    化学工业部今年上半年基本建设进度比较迟缓，到6月底止，才完成年度计划的29.3％。在下半年6个月的时间内完成占全年计划70％左右的工作量，任务相当艰巨。根据上述情况，化学工业部最近对所属单位发出紧急指示，要求各有关单位努力设法完成今年的基本建设任务。指示要求，各基本建设单位负责人应亲自动手根据积极而又稳妥可靠的精神对今年的基本建设计划重新进行一次适当的调整和平衡，甲乙双方应该更好地协作，各有关部门要尽最大的努力作好各项材料供应工作。
    在这以前，化学工业部曾派出以司、局长为首的工作组，分别到兰州、太原、石家庄、吉林等重点建设地区，协助所属各基本建设单位检查工作，解决问题。到兰州去的工作组就通过召集甲乙双方领导人员碰头协商，解决了拖延很久的甲乙双方工作不协调的问题，并且使原材料不足的问题基本上得到解决。
    进入8月份以来，化工部又在华北、东北、华东等地分区召开了一系列的基本建设会议，会后又在北京进行了总平衡。通过这一系列的工作，过去有些地区存在的材料不足、或者有材料但是规格不符合需要的问题，基本上都解决了。
