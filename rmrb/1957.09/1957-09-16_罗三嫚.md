    One day during the Spring Festival, I took a small path along the river to visit a friend in a village on the earth mound. More than a decade ago, I had taught there for a few months. At that time, the feudal forces in this village were extremely stubborn. Women were not allowed to raise their heads when walking on the street, and the innocent elementary school students would immediately become rigid upon hearing the cough of those "men in long gowns".
    I strolled leisurely, recalling the events that had occurred during those short teaching days. It wasn't until I heard a burst of gongs and drums that I realized I was already standing by the familiar pond at the entrance of the village. This beautiful pond had also cast a shadow on people's hearts. I remember that when I first came here for a walk, the students told me about a suicide by drowning, which swept away my interest in sightseeing. But soon, such a heartbreaking thing happened right before my eyes.
    It was about a month after I came to this village to teach. One day, my colleague, Mr. Luo, walked into the office with a troubled face, followed by a woman in her early twenties, short, with a bob haircut, a pair of gloomy large eyes, wearing a light-colored short jacket, standing obediently to one side. Mr. Luo said that this woman was called Luo Sanman, his neighbor's niece, from a very poor family. Later, she married into a declining family in this village, and her husband died just a year after the wedding. Since then, Luo Sanman had only been able to make a living in tears. Later, she plucked up the courage to request to enroll in school. Her mother-in-law sympathized with her, but the "man in the long gown," the clan elder, refused to nod his head, saying that schooling was not something a chaste and filial widow should think about. So, she came to seek help from Mr. Luo. Mr. Luo and I felt that since she had the determination herself and her mother-in-law did not object, we took her in and enrolled her in the third grade.
    But not many days later, one morning, Luo Sanman did not come to school, nor did she ask for leave. In the classroom, the students were whispering, and the air was a little tense. I guessed that something had happened to Luo Sanman. It turned out that the night before, she had been summoned by the "man in the long gown," the clan elder, and severely reprimanded. She refused to accept it and retorted, which angered the clan elder. He threw his long smoking pipe heavily on the table, revealing a face full of murderous intent, and shouted sternly, "Kneel down!" Luo Sanman trembled, sobbing sadly, and knelt for two hours before fainting to the ground. The clan elder then dragged her into a room and locked her up. That night, this beast, full of benevolence and morality, actually tried to rape her.
    About a month later, one evening, I was walking back to school by the pond when I saw Luo Sanman carrying a basket of clothes, like a timid lamb, walking along the base of the wall with her head down. The only blush on her cheeks had disappeared, and her face was frighteningly pale. When she saw me, she looked a little flustered at first, then looked at me with a pleading gaze, gently called out "Teacher—", and quickly lowered her eyes and walked towards the pond.
    An hour later, a bad news spread in the village: Luo Sanman was washing clothes by the pond when she threw herself into the water. Fortunately, she was discovered early and rescued. That night, Mr. Luo and I didn't even eat dinner, only sighed. Soon, I left the village, and later left my hometown, and never heard from Luo Sanman again.
    More than a decade later, now I have come here again. I followed the sound of gongs and drums towards the center of the street, where I saw a dense crowd of people surrounding a Yangge dance, and the humorous lyrics made people burst into laughter. I was engrossed in watching when two young men and a middle-aged woman walked towards me. I immediately recognized the two young men as a pair of naughty students from my former class; I didn't recognize the middle-aged woman. She was dressed as a rural woman, with a stout boy beside her. At first, she looked at me with surprised eyes, and then suddenly grabbed my hand and said excitedly, "It's you, Teacher Lü, when did you come?"
    "You, you are..." I was stunned.
    "What, you don't recognize me? Teacher Lü, hee! It's, well, let's say the old name, shall we? I am Luo Sanman, the Luo Sanman who went to your school for five days."
    "Oh! You, you are Luo Sanman?" I was even more bewildered, because the strong, ruddy-faced, and cheerful woman standing in front of me at this moment, I could not connect with the image of Luo Sanman back then. I said, "So you are still in this village!"
    "What are you saying, teacher, this is my home, if I am not in this village where would I be?" She smiled, her eyes lively and deep.
    "No, I don't mean that, I mean..." I suddenly realized that what I was about to say should not be said, because this was just my subconscious mind that had not gotten rid of Luo Sanman from back then. But this idea of ​​mine did not escape Luo Sanman's sensitivity, and she immediately laughed: "Well, I understand what you mean, you mean I should have remarried to another village long ago, right? You are wrong. Teacher Lü, let's go, let's sit at home." So we walked slowly, and she continued talking.
    "Looking back now, how weak and confused I was back then," Luo Sanman said in a tone of blaming herself, "I threw myself into the pond, I knelt in front of the clan elder and shed tears. However, my heart was not so submissive, I thought: Why are there so many inequalities in the world? I don't believe it will always be like this, I'm waiting. After liberation, the raging fire of resistance in my heart suddenly broke out. I thought about remarrying, but I also seemed to feel that the first thing I should do was not remarry, I felt that I should do more important things. As for what more important things were, I couldn't say for a while, but the Communist Party pointed it out to me. I followed the Party. Whatever the Party wanted me to do, I would do it wholeheartedly. When the army fought, we went to carry stretchers and take care of the wounded; during the anti-despot and land reform, the sisters elected me as the village's women's chairman. You know how those 'men in long gowns' used to look at us women, but when we organized, they were worthless, and they trembled when they stood in front of us. Later, the Kuomintang came to fight us again. At that time, I was already a Party member. The task the Party gave me at that time was to monitor the activities of the landlords and lead the villagers to evacuate. I carried a few grenades and worked with the militia and the Youth Women's Team on Xishan to harass the Kuomintang bandits and cover the villagers' evacuation..."
    "You were already married at that time, right?" I interrupted her.
    "No, well, but at that time we..., um, he was the militia captain at that time, we got married in 1948. He is now the vice president of the agricultural cooperative. Look," she pointed to the boy beside her and said, "This is my first child, and there is another little girl who went to play with her father."
    "You are very happy!" I said this sentence with an uncontrollable excitement.
    Her expression suddenly became serious. "Think about it, without the Communist Party, I could only lie at the feet of the landlord and shed tears. When the Communist Party came, I, a little widow who didn't dare to raise my head and walk on the street in the old society, also understood what it meant to serve the masses. I care about the masses, and the masses care more about me. In the past, I couldn't wait to leave this village all at once, but at this time I didn't want to leave. I secretly encouraged myself and said: I won't leave, I will personally watch it change here, see what it can become. Later, the masses elected me as the deputy township head, and I knew even more that my responsibility was to work with the masses to use our own hands to push it to change..." Her eyes swept across the rows of new houses on both sides of the street. "Now, it has indeed changed, it is already socialism. Look, how is this compared to when you taught here? Not to mention the masses, even some of those 'men in long gowns' have been reborn. Some of their children are Communist Party members, and some are Communist Youth League members. Their grandchildren also wear red scarves around their necks, they only know how to jump and sing, they don't even understand what 'feudal rule' is..."
    I am now completely attracted by her calm and generous demeanor. It's only been a little over a decade! Speaking of changes, I could see and feel them when I first stepped on the land of my hometown. But at this moment, I truly saw the changes of an era from Luo Sanman.

　　罗三嫚
　　吕建中
    春节的一天，我沿着河边的小路到土岗那边一个村庄看朋友。十多年前我曾在那里教过几个月书。那时候，这个村庄的封建势力非常顽固，妇女不能在大街上抬起头来走路，天真的小学生一听到那几个“穿长袍的人”的咳嗽声，就会立刻变得呆板起来。
    我悠闲地走着，回忆着在那短短的教书的日子里所发生的事情。直到耳边传来一阵锣鼓声，我才发觉我已经站在村头那个熟悉的池塘边了。这个美丽的池塘也曾在人们的心灵上蒙过一层阴影，记得当初我第一次到这里散步，学生们就告诉我曾有人投塘自杀的事，使我的游兴为之一扫。但是随后这种痛心的事情就发生在我自己的眼前。
    那是我来到这村教书一个月以后的事情。一天，我的同事罗先生带着为难的脸色走进办公室，后面跟着一个二十岁上下的女人，矮身量，剪发头，一双阴沉的大眼睛，穿一件月白色短袄，顺从地站在一边。罗先生说，这女人叫罗三嫚，是他的街坊侄女，家里很穷。后来嫁给这村一个破落了的人家，过门刚满一年就死了丈夫。从此，罗三嫚只能在眼泪里讨生活了。后来她壮着胆子提出入学的要求，婆母倒体谅了她，而那个“穿长袍的”族长却不肯点头，说入学不是守贞节、尽孝道的媳妇所应该想的。于是她就来求救于罗先生了。我和罗先生觉得她自己既有此决心，婆母又不阻拦，就收留了她，把她编入了三年级。
    可是过了不几天，一天上午，罗三嫚没有到校，也没有请假。教室里，同学们在嘁嘁喳喳，空气有些紧张，我猜想罗三嫚是发生了什么事。原来头一天晚上她被那个“穿长袍的”族长叫去大加斥责，她不服，还了嘴，这下子把族长触怒了，他把长烟管往桌上狠狠一丢，闪出满脸杀气，厉声喝道：“你给我跪——下！”罗三嫚战栗着，伤心地啜泣着，跪了两个钟头，后来昏倒在地上了。族长便把她拖到一间房子里关起来。当天夜里，这个满口仁义道德的野兽竟想强奸她。
    又隔了约一个月，一个傍晚，我打池塘边走回学校，迎面看见罗三嫚挎着一篮衣服，像一只胆怯的小羊，顺着墙脚低头走过来，面颊上仅有的一点红晕也消失了，脸色苍白得可怕。她看见我，开始神情有些慌张，后来用一种乞求的眼神看看我，轻轻叫了一声“老师——”，又连忙顺下眼睛向池塘那边走去了。
    一个钟头以后，村里便传开了一个坏消息：罗三嫚在池塘边洗着洗着衣服，投水了。幸好发现得早，被救活了。当晚我和罗先生饭也没有吃，只是叹气。不久，我就离开了这个村庄，后来又离开了家乡，再没有听到罗三嫚的信息。
    相隔了十几年，现在我又来到这里了。我循着锣鼓声走向街心，只见密密丛丛的人在围拢着一台秧歌，诙谐的唱词使人们发出阵阵哄笑，我正看得入迷，两个年轻小伙子和一个中年妇女朝我走过来，我一下子就认出那两个小伙子是当年一对同班的顽皮学生；那个中年妇女我却认不得，她是农村妇女打扮，身边跟着一个挺壮实的男孩，她开头张着惊疑的大眼睛看我，后来就一下子扯住我的手，激动地说：“是你呀，吕老师，您什么时候来的？”
    “您，您是……”我呆住了。
    “怎么，您不认识我啦？吕老师，嘻！我是，唔，还是说过去的名子吧？我是罗三嫚，跟您上了五天学的那个罗三嫚。”
    “哦！您，您就是罗三嫚？”我越发惶惑了，因为此刻站在我眼前的这个壮体红面，性格爽朗的妇女，我怎么也不能和当年那个罗三嫚的形象联系起来。我说：“原来您还在这个村呀！”
    “看您说的，老师，这里是我的家，我不在这村在哪村？”她微笑着，眼睛活泼而深沉。
    “不，我不是这个意思，我是说……”我忽然察觉我后面的话不应该说出来，因为这只不过是我下意识里还没有摆脱掉当年的那个罗三嫚罢了。可是我这种想法并没有逃过罗三嫚的敏感，她立刻笑道：“唔，我明白您的意思了，您是说我早就应该改嫁到外村去了，是不是？您可想错了。吕老师，走吧，到家里坐吧。”于是我们缓步走着，她继续说着。
    “现在想起来，我当年多么懦弱，多么糊涂呀，”罗三嫚用嗔怪自己的口气说，“我投塘自杀，我跪在族长面前流眼泪。不过，我心里也并不是那样服服贴贴的呀，我想：世界上为什么要有这末多不平等的事呢？我不相信会永远是这样，我等着。解放以后，我心里那股反抗的烈火一下子就发作了。我想到过改嫁，可是我又仿佛觉得我应该做的事首先不是改嫁，我觉得我应该做更重要的事。至于更重要的事是什么，我一时也说不清楚，后来还是共产党给我指出来了。我跟着党。党要我干什么我就一心一意地去干。军队打仗，我们去抬担架，照护伤员，反恶霸、土地改革的时候，姊妹们选我当村里的妇女会长，您是知道那些‘穿长袍的人’过去是怎样看待我们妇女的，可是当我们组织起来时，他们就一钱不值，站在我们面前直打哆嗦。后来，国民党又来打咱们，那时候我已经是党员了，当时党交给我的任务是监视地主的活动和带领村里老百姓转移。我带着几颗手榴弹，同民兵、青妇队在西山上一面扰乱国民党的土匪队，一面掩护老百姓转移。……”
    “那时候您已经结婚了吧？”我截住她的话。
    “没有，唔，不过那时候俺俩……，嗯，他当时是民兵队长，我们1948年结的婚。他现在是农业社里的副社长。您看，”他指指她身边那个男孩，说，“这是我的头一个孩子，还有个小女孩，跟她爸爸玩去了。”
    “您很幸福！”我以一种难以抑制的兴奋心情说出这句话。
    她的神情忽然严肃起来。“您想想，没有共产党，我只能躺在地主的脚底下流眼泪。共产党来了，我这个在旧社会不敢在大街上抬起头来走路的小寡妇，也懂得什么叫为群众服务了。我关心群众，群众就更关心我。过去我恨不能一下子离开这个村，可是这时候我不想离开了。我还悄悄地鼓励自己说：偏不离开，非在这里亲眼看着它变，看它能变成什么样儿。后来，群众又选我做副乡长了，我更知道我的责任就是和群众一起用自己的手来推动它变。……”她的眼睛扫一下街两旁那一排排新房。“现在，它的确变了，已经是社会主义了。您看，这比当年您在这里教书的时候怎样？不要说群众，就连那些‘穿长袍的人’有的也脱胎换骨了。他们的子女有的是共产党员，有的是共青团员。他们的孙子孙女脖子上也都挂着红领巾，他们光知道跳呀，唱呀的，就连什么是‘封建统治’，他们都不大懂……”
    我现在全然被她这种谈笑自若，落落大方的气概吸引住了。这只不过是十几年的时间呵！说起变化，这在我刚踏上故乡的土地的时候，就看得出和感觉得到了。而此刻，我却从罗三嫚身上逼真地看到了一个时代的变化。
