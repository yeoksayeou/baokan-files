"Shan Niang" Wine Re-enters the Market

    Shaoxing "Shan Niang," the "King of Wines" which had been discontinued for eighteen years, was first produced and put on the market on September 2nd.
    Shaoxing wine is ranked as excellent among the eight famous wines in the country, and "Shan Niang" is the best among Shaoxing's famous wines. It has a sweet, rich, mellow, and fragrant taste, and is unique in its color. In 1939, it was stopped brewing due to sabotage by the Japanese invaders. Production resumed in 1956. In the first year of resumption, the local state-owned Shaoxing Winery and the joint state-private Shen Yonghe Winery brewed 460,000 catties.
    After the first batch of "Shan Niang" was released on the market, consumers unanimously praised it. According to an experienced old man, "The Shan Niang wine on the market this time is of excellent quality and delicious, and is completely comparable to the Shan Niang produced by Shen Yonghe Winery eighteen years ago."
    Before this year's National Day, this fine wine will be transported and sold to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and other places.

    “善酿”酒重新登市
    中断十八年之久的“酒中之王”绍兴“善酿”，已在9月2日首次出厂登市。
    绍兴酒在全国八大名酒中名列优等，而“善酿”又是绍兴名酒中的佳酿，味甘厚而醇和，芬芳馥郁，独具一色。1939年，因遭到日寇破坏而停酿。1956年恢复生产。开酿第一年，地方国营绍兴酒厂和公私合营沈永和酒厂就酿造出了四十六万斤。
    这次首批“善酿”登市后，消费者一致赞赏。据一位有经验的老人说：“这次上市的善酿酒，质优味美，完全可同十八年前沈永和酒厂的善酿媲美。”
    在今年国庆前夕，这一美酒将运销杭州、上海、北京等地。
