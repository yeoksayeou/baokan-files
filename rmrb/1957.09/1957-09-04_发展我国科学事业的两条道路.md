Two Roads for Developing China's Scientific Undertakings
Yu Guangyuan

On how to develop China's scientific undertakings, right-wing elements and we have fundamental differences. This fundamental difference is the struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road, as pointed out by Comrade Nie Rongzhen in his speech at the enlarged meeting of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies on July 17. Now I would like to express some personal opinions specifically from the perspective of natural science.

    Serving Socialist Construction

Taking the socialist road in developing scientific undertakings means, first and foremost, that scientific undertakings must have a clear goal of serving socialist construction. To this end, scientists should combine national construction needs with individual expertise and theory with practice in their scientific research. In contrast, taking the capitalist road means denying the principle that scientific undertakings must serve national socialist construction, advocating science for science's sake, and asserting that scientists can conduct research based solely on personal achievements and interests, regardless of national needs.

Science always serves a certain social production and a certain class. This is the fundamental reason why science, as a social phenomenon, is able to exist and develop rapidly along with the development of human society. Not only does social science have a strong class nature and inevitably serves the interests of a certain class, but natural science itself, which has no class nature, also serves a certain social production and serves the ruling class that controls the production of that society.

In capitalist countries, many scientists do not see this point. They regard conducting research itself as the purpose of their work. They believe that their work is not influenced by any "utilitarianism." In fact, in capitalist countries, capitalists directly or indirectly control research institutions and research funding organizations. They always decide whether to support or oppose a certain research work based on considerations of whether it can bring them greater profits and based on the political and military considerations of the bourgeois state, thereby actually influencing and directing the activities of the entire scientific community.

In socialist countries, science benefits all working people. Here, scientists, like workers and peasants, fulfill their responsibilities to the country and the people through research, a form of labor. His research results directly serve the people. Unlike capitalist scientific undertakings, socialist scientific undertakings openly emphasize their purpose of serving national construction and emphasize that scientists should consciously serve socialist construction.

In recent years, our Party and government have consistently adhered to the principle that scientific work must serve socialist construction and used this principle to educate scientists. The majority of scientists in our country have also understood this principle. Through their own work practice in recent years, they have realized the correctness of this principle. The bourgeois right-wing elements are completely the opposite. Since they are hostile to socialism, they of course oppose scientific work serving socialist construction and try to lure Chinese scientists away from the path of serving socialism.

The Central Committee of the China Democratic League's document, which was denounced by President Guo Moruo as an anti-socialist science program, blatantly shows how the right-wing elements oppose scientific work serving socialist construction. This document not only does not mention a single word about scientific work serving the needs of national construction, but also requires those scientists who have already obeyed the needs of national construction and embarked on new and important jobs to not overcome the temporary difficulties in working conditions and return to "their original research environment." The anti-socialist science program regards "research work 'going to people'" as the main principle for organizing China's scientific work, which is even more used to oppose adjusting the existing scientific forces according to the needs of national construction.

The necessity of appropriately adjusting the existing scientific forces is mainly due to the following reasons. First of all, not only was China's scientific undertaking weak in the old China, but the distribution of existing research institutions and research forces was also unreasonable. In order to give full play to the strength of scientists and make full use of research equipment, research institutions must be as close as possible to the research objects. Secondly, at present, our country is rapidly establishing some disciplines that are urgently needed by the country and that are blank or weak. These disciplines generally require complex and huge experimental equipment, and the experimental part (and even some theoretical parts) of its research work cannot be carried out by a few scientists alone. It requires scientists to work closely together collectively. To this end, it is necessary to concentrate a group of scientists, and even require some scientists to "change careers" within the scope of their original expertise and switch to research work that is urgently needed by the country. At the same time, in order to support the scientific and cultural construction of newly built industrial areas and some minority areas, it is also necessary to establish new universities and new scientific research institutions in these areas, and some scientists need to "leave their original research environment" to work in these places. Research work may be temporarily affected when initially arriving in a new research environment. But from a long-term perspective, this is more beneficial to the development of China's scientific undertaking. The right-wing elements' opposition to the necessary adjustment of the existing scientific forces is to hold back our scientists and disrupt the Party and the country's deployment of scientific forces, so that China's scientific work cannot adapt to the needs of national socialist construction.

The right-wing also tried their best to promote the erroneous view of bourgeois "science for science's sake." They said that "emphasizing service to national needs is utilitarianism, and utilitarianism will inevitably hinder the development of science," deliberately opposing obedience to national needs and the interests of scientific development itself, and preventing scientists from making contributions to the working people and seeking benefits for the socialist country. The argument that "emphasizing service to production needs will hinder the development of science" is also completely inconsistent with the facts of scientific development. Let's not talk about the facts of scientific development in socialist countries for the time being. If we compare modern science with the science of the 17th and 18th centuries, the actual connection between modern science and all aspects of social life is much closer and more "utilitarian" than in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, the development of modern science is much faster than that of the 17th and 18th centuries.

    Be Planned and Organized

In order for scientific undertakings to effectively serve socialist construction, they must be planned and organized. This is especially true for a country like China, where science is relatively backward, if it wants to catch up with the world's advanced level in a short period of time. Because only in this way can the most urgent disciplines be given priority development in line with national needs. Only in this way can various disciplines be developed in a balanced manner based on the overall situation and trends of scientific development and based on the internal connections between various disciplines. Only in this way can the scientific forces in all aspects be brought into full play. However, the bourgeois right-wing elements tried their best to promote the idea that the United States does not have a comprehensive plan or a systematic organization, but its scientific level is very high. If China's science wants to reach the level of the United States, it should follow the path of the United States. They deliberately do not mention such facts in front of people: It has taken the United States more than 100 years to develop modern science to the present. Because they have no plan and lack organization, they have caused serious waste in manpower and material resources. Despite the fact that American science has the support of its strong industrial base, has a long-term stable environment, and has absorbed a large number of foreign scientists, its development is still slow. Conversely, let's look at the situation in the Soviet Union. Before the revolution, the Soviet Union was a country with relatively backward science. However, due to the full use of the superiority of the socialist system, it planned and organized the development of its scientific undertakings, so that despite experiencing a long and brutal war, it was still able to catch up with and surpass the United States in many scientific fields, especially in atomic energy and aviation, in just a few decades. Isn't the historical fact a clear proof of the correctness of our country's current policy of developing scientific undertakings? If we follow the path of the right-wing elements, China's science will never be able to get rid of its backward state, and China's industrial and agricultural production and national defense construction will be in an unfavorable position due to the lack of advanced science and technology.

In the current scientific community in China, there is such an argument against developing China's scientific undertakings in a planned way, saying that the task of science is to explore the "unknown" of nature. Isn't planning the "unknown" becoming a "fortune teller"? This statement seems to make some sense, but it is actually extremely wrong.

Scientific research is exploratory work, that's right. However, the development of scientific undertakings, and even the acquisition of scientific achievements, is not completely unpredictable. The research work of any scientist with a certain level is carried out with a purpose and a plan for him personally. It is only in capitalist countries that scientific research, like production, is restricted by capitalist ownership and divided by the competition of various capitalist groups, so it is impossible for the scientific work of the entire country to be carried out in a planned way. The socialist economy is a planned economy, and the country's needs for science can be mostly raised through the formulation of economic plans. The current situation and trends of the development of various sciences can be basically grasped through the collective analysis of scientists. These are the basis for formulating scientific work plans. It is possible to formulate plans for the development of scientific undertakings and scientific research work. The so-called "fortune teller" statement is just a malicious slander.

Of course, we also emphasize that the planning of scientific work has its own characteristics, and it cannot be required to make rigid regulations on the results of the work and the completion deadline in advance like production plans. Moreover, the development of some scientific departments may be underestimated in advance, so a part of scientists should be allowed to carry out research work that they think is worthwhile outside the plan to supplement the shortcomings of the plan. However, the possibility and necessity of planning can never be denied because of this. As far as the 1956-1967 long-term plan for the development of science and technology and this year's annual plan that have already been formulated are concerned, although they still need to be revised and supplemented continuously according to various new situations, the basic direction it stipulates is undoubtedly correct. It points out the prospects for the development of science and technology in our country for Chinese scientists and encourages the creative enthusiasm of Chinese scientists. Facts have proved that it has already played a significant and positive role in the development of China's scientific undertaking, and it will show a greater positive role in the future.

China's existing scientific system is a guarantee for the planned and organized development of China's scientific undertaking. Therefore, the right-wing also wantonly attacked China's current scientific work system. The China Democratic League's anti-socialist science program especially opposes the Academy of Sciences as the "center" of national unified academic leadership, opposes the proposal made by Premier Zhou on behalf of the CPC Central Committee in the report on intellectuals that the Academy of Sciences must be strengthened to make it a "locomotive" for improving the national scientific level, and stigmatizes this view as "subjectively pre-determining it." The characteristic of modern science is that the mutual connection and mutual influence of various disciplines are very close. The major scientific problems in national construction often require comprehensive research by many disciplines to solve. Unified academic leadership is necessary for scientific development. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is conducting research work in many important aspects of science. The departments of the Academy of Sciences include the best scientists in the national research system. If such an Academy of Sciences cannot serve as the center of national academic leadership and cannot serve as the "locomotive" for improving the national scientific level, then who can serve as this "center" and this "locomotive"?

Right-wing elements such as Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang also have their ulterior motives for opposing the Academy of Sciences as the center of national academic leadership, that is, they hope to completely decentralize scientific research work to various universities, which is convenient for them to seize the leadership of scientific undertakings. Their attempt is now very clearly exposed.

    Have the Leadership of the Party

The Party's leadership over scientific work is a guarantee that China's scientific undertaking can develop along the socialist road. Therefore, the bourgeois right-wing elements tried their best to oppose the Party's leadership over scientific work. They said that the Party is an "outsider" to science, and how can an "outsider" lead an "insider"? They also shamelessly called themselves "insiders," saying that they know "big intellectuals" best, and that scientific work should be led by them. The absurdity of this statement has now been forcefully refuted by many people. What we are now doing is a socialist scientific undertaking, and the right-wing opposes socialism. They are actually insiders who lead socialist scientific undertakings. Isn't this a big joke? Scientists across the country have already learned about their insiders from the China Democratic League's anti-socialist science program. The right-wing is completely an utter outsider when it comes to leading socialist scientific undertakings.

Can the Party lead science? The Party is a political organization. The Party leads scientific work, neither directly conducting scientific research nor conducting specific leadership like a scientist arranging the work of his assistants. These works are indeed matters for the scientists themselves. The Party's leadership over science mainly includes: First, proposing the principles and policies for developing scientific undertakings, formulating national plans for developing scientific undertakings, and various systems related to scientific work; second, doing a good job in uniting, organizing, educating, and transforming scientists, strengthening the ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism for scientific research, criticizing various erroneous academic thoughts, helping scientists understand the needs of the country, and strengthening ties with the people; third, mobilizing and organizing forces from all sides to support scientific undertakings, ensuring that scientists have the conditions for smooth work, promoting the full utilization of scientific research results in all aspects, and popularizing scientific knowledge.

To solve the problems of the principles, policies, and plans for developing socialist scientific undertakings, we must have the leadership of the Party. Because only the Party can deeply understand the current situation and tasks of national construction, understand the current and long-term needs of national construction for science in all aspects, can deeply understand the current situation and trends of the development of the entire science and various sciences, understand the prospects opened up by scientific development for construction undertakings, and can understand what kind of scientific work system is conducive to the development of scientific undertakings.

To do a good job in uniting, organizing, educating, and transforming scientists, and in the ideological leadership of academics, we must have the leadership of the Party. Because only the Party can deeply understand the role of scientists in national construction, understand their political attitude and ideological awareness, because only the Party can master the position, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, correctly handle the relationship between politics and academics, and correctly handle the relationship between dialectical materialism, which is the general law of nature, society, and thinking, and various specific sciences.

To be able to do a good job in supporting scientific work and coordinating scientific work, promoting scientific achievements, etc., we must also have the leadership of the Party. Because only the Party can mobilize forces from all sides to support scientific work and coordinate relations in all aspects.

In short, only the Communist Party, a political organization of the proletarian vanguard that leads the people of the whole country in carrying out socialist transformation and construction, can shoulder the responsibility of leading the development of socialist scientific undertakings.

Of course, the Party conducts leadership over scientific work in close cooperation with scientists. Following the mass line in work is the Party's consistent work style. The Party maintains regular contact with scientists, conducts comradely discussions with them, humbly listens to their opinions, and accepts their correct suggestions. Precisely because of this, the Party is able to concentrate the wisdom and experience of the vast number of scientists, which is one of the conditions for the Party to be able to lead scientific work.

A large part of the Party's leadership over scientific work must be realized through Party member cadres in state organs, enterprises, schools, scientific research institutions, scientific organizations, and other organizations. Many of the Party members who hold leading positions in these organizations are not scientists. Can they shoulder this kind of leadership work?

To do a good job in the leadership of political ideology, principles, policies, plans, etc. in scientific work, of course, it is necessary to have a certain level of education. In fact, the Party member cadres who are engaged in this aspect of work generally have such a level of education. However, like doing other leadership work, what is required of the Party's leading cadres is first of all their proletarian position, the political and ideological level of Marxism-Leninism, and the good work style and organizational work ability of being good at connecting with the masses. As long as they have the above conditions, and can humbly learn professional knowledge and scientific knowledge when engaged in scientific leadership work, and strive to master the characteristics of scientific work, they will be fully able to become insiders of the Party's leadership of scientific work after a certain period of experience accumulation. We hope that in the future, the Party members who hold leading positions in scientific work will be scientists themselves, but this is not possible at present and requires long-term efforts.

It is obviously wrong to say that only scientists can lead scientific work. Modern science has all kinds of disciplines and a very wide range. If it is said that only scientists can lead scientific work, then in fact there can be no leadership over the entire scientific work, or even leadership over a scientific department or a research institution. Because even in a scientific department or a research institution, the scientific problems involved are very complex, and it is very difficult to find a scientist who can be proficient in many fields.

    Thoroughly Smash the Right-Wing Elements' Conspiracy and Defend the Socialist Road of Developing Scientific Undertakings

Under the leadership of the Party, China's scientific undertaking is advancing along the socialist road and has achieved great results. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call to march towards science last year, China's scientific undertaking has developed even more rapidly. In the face of this rapid development, China's existing limited scientific forces have become even more unable to meet the needs of national construction. Although the conditions for scientific work have been greatly improved, they cannot fully meet the requirements for carrying out research due to the limitations of the existing industrial level and national financial resources. The Party, the government, and the leading experience of scientists who are in charge of leadership work, the organizational forms, rules, and regulations of leading scientific work also have places that are not fully adapted to the development of the work. These are all problems that exist in the rapid development of scientific undertakings. In this rectification movement, the Party organizations of the units concerned have adopted various forms to invite scientists to criticize the shortcomings in scientific work, hoping to work together with scientists to expose the contradictions in the development of scientific work in China and find ways to solve the contradictions and improve the work. Many scientists, also under the call of the Party, have put forward many correct criticisms and suggestions in the spirit of improving work. Some criticisms have taken a very sharp form, but they are helpful for improving work. The Party and the government will adopt them in their work. Of course, some scientists also have incorrect parts in the opinions they have put forward. However, as long as they are proceeding from good intentions, the Party and the government will treat them with patient explanation and persuasion, and wait for them to gradually correct their views in work practice.

The political purpose of the right-wing elements standing on the anti-socialist position and taking the opportunity of rectification to launch a frenzied attack on the scientific undertaking led by the Party is to try to tamper with the direction of China's scientific work and seize the leadership of scientific work. In addition to what has been said before, they have also tried their best to obliterate the necessity of carrying out various reforms in scientific work, tried their best to obliterate the achievements of scientific work since liberation, and promoted that scientific work has "stagnated" for eight years, with no achievements to speak of, and a complete mess. The problem for the next twelve years is not to catch up with the international level, but to make up for the lessons of the past twelve years, etc. They also oppose our advocacy of learning from Soviet science and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in developing scientific undertakings, trying their best to belittle and obliterate the achievements of Soviet science, while vigorously promoting the experience of scientific work in capitalist countries that is not in line with China's socialist system and is not conducive to the development of China's socialist scientific undertaking. They sow discord between the Party and scientists, fabricate that scientists have suffered a "holocaust," put forward the slogan of "protecting scientists," and pretend to be the "protectors" of scientists. They promote everywhere that scientists do not need to carry out ideological transformation and do not need to learn Marxism-Leninism. They oppose the Party's carrying out ideological and political work among scientists, so that they can spread and expand the influence of bourgeois ideology. They sow discord between the Party and young scientific workers, and incite them to oppose the Party and make trouble. They oppose paying attention to political conditions when training young cadres, and try their best to instill bourgeois ideology in young people, attempting to fundamentally change the young generation of scientific workers in our country into a reserve force for them to cultivate anti-Party and anti-socialist. They sow discord among the scientists working in various systems, especially the relationship between the scientists of the Academy of Sciences and the universities, and fabricate that the Party and the government favor one over the other, undermining the unity between the scientists and the Party and the government. They squeeze out and attack Communist Party members in scientific institutions and activists who are close to the Party, firmly support socialism, and support China's scientific undertaking in taking the socialist road.

The right-wing elements in the scientific community have long premeditated to tamper with the socialist road of China's scientific undertaking and usurp the leadership of scientific undertakings. This time is the total exposure of their conspiracy.

Now the right-wing elements' attack on scientific undertakings has been strongly counterattacked by the entire scientific community. They have become isolated in the scientific community. At this time, some right-wing elements who insist on making mistakes have reversed their previous ferocious appearance when attacking the Party and the people, and pretended to be pitiful people who have suffered undue punishment just because they put forward "opinions" on scientific work. They also said behind their backs that the criticism of their anti-socialist science program was making a fuss over a trifle. They did this in an attempt to win the sympathy of people who lack political experience, and thereby counterattack the Party and the people, saying that you cannot tolerate opinions and retaliate against those who put forward opinions. Their intentions are vicious.

Is it true that the right-wing gentlemen have been denounced by the scientific community and the people of the whole country just because they put forward opinions on scientific work? You are not putting forward any opinions on scientific work, but are taking the opportunity of rectification to stir up trouble everywhere, light fires everywhere, and carry out their real intention of tampering with the road of developing scientific undertakings and usurping the leadership of scientific work. As for well-intentioned opinions, please don't worry, we will be able to see them, study them, and adopt them.

Is it true that criticizing the anti-socialist science program of the right-wing elements is making a fuss over a trifle? As analyzed earlier in this article, the anti-socialist science program and many related remarks of other right-wing elements involve the major issues of right and wrong in the development of China's scientific undertaking. If China's scientific undertaking is developed according to the capitalist road designed by the right-wing elements, China's scientific undertaking will never be able to get rid of its backward state, let alone catch up with the world level in twelve years. It will make China unable to make contributions in the current fierce and sharp scientific competition between socialist countries and imperialist countries. It will put China's industrial and agricultural production and national defense construction in an unfavorable position due to the lack of modern science and technology. In the face of such major issues of right and wrong, shouldn't China's scientific community launch a resolute criticism of the right-wing elements? Shouldn't we rise up to resolutely defend the socialist road of developing scientific undertakings that concerns the fate of the country?

At present, Chinese scientists are launching a resolute struggle against the bourgeois right-wing elements in order to defend socialism. This struggle has not only shattered the right-wing elements' frenzied attack on the Party, the people, and socialism, but also made our scientists more aware of the necessity of working hard to transform their own ideology, more firmly established their position of serving the working people and serving socialism, and more clearly defined the socialist road of developing scientific undertakings. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, Chinese scientists will confidently stride forward along the socialist road.

    发展我国科学事业的两条道路
    于光远
    在如何发展我国科学事业上，右派分子与我们存在着根本的分歧。这个根本的分歧就是聂荣臻同志在7月17日中华全国自然科学专门学会全国委员会扩大会议的讲话中所指出的，资本主义道路和社会主义道路的斗争。现在我想专从自然科学方面发表一些个人意见。
      为社会主义建设服务
    在发展科学事业中走社会主义道路，首先就是科学事业要有为社会主义建设服务的明确目标。为此，科学家在科学研究时要根据国家建设需要和个人专长相结合，理论和实际相结合的原则。而走资本主义道路则与此相反，就是否认科学事业必须为国家社会主义建设服务的原则，提倡为科学而科学，主张科学家可以不顾国家需要单从个人成就、个人兴趣出发来进行研究工作。
    科学总是为一定的社会生产，为一定的阶级服务的。这是科学作为一种社会现象，所以能够存在并且能够随着人类社会的发展而迅速发展的根本原因。不但社会科学有强烈的阶级性，必然服务于一定阶级的利益，就是本身没有阶级性的自然科学，同样为一定的社会生产服务，为掌握那个社会的生产的统治阶级服务。
    在资本主义国家中，不少科学家看不到这一点的。他们把进行研究本身说成就是他们工作的目的。认为他们的工作不受任何“功利”的影响。其实在资本主义国家中，资本家直接或间接地控制着研究机构和研究基金组织，他们总是根据能否为自己带来更大的利润的考虑，根据资产阶级国家政治和军事上的考虑，决定支持或反对这一项或那一项研究工作，从而在实际上影响着、指挥着整个科学界的活动。
    社会主义国家中，科学是为全体劳动人民造福的，在这里，科学家像工人、农民一样，通过研究工作这种劳动来履行他对国家、对人民应负的责任。他的研究成果，直接服务于人民。与资本主义的科学事业不同，社会主义科学事业公开强调它为国家建设服务的目的性，强调科学家应该自觉地为社会主义建设服务。
    几年来，我们党和政府一贯坚持科学工作必须为社会主义建设服务的原则，并用这个原则来教育科学家。我国大多数科学家也已经懂得这个原则，通过几年来自己的工作实践，他们认识到这个原则的正确。而资产阶级右派分子完全相反，他们既然仇视社会主义，当然反对科学工作必须为社会主义建设服务，力图引诱我国科学家离开为社会主义服务的道路。
    被郭沫若院长斥为反社会主义科学纲领的民盟中央的文件，露骨地表明了右派分子如何反对科学工作为社会主义建设服务。在这个文件中不但对科学工作服务于国家建设的需要一字不提，而且还要求那些已经服从国家建设需要，走上新的重要的工作岗位的科学家，不去克服工作条件方面的暂时困难，回到“原来的研究环境”。反社会主义科学纲领中把“研究工作去‘就人’”作为组织我国科学工作的主要原则，更是用来反对按照国家建设需要对现有科学力量加以调整的。
    对现有科学力量进行适当调整的必要，主要有下面几方面的理由。首先，旧中国的科学事业不但基础薄弱，而且已有的研究机构和研究力量的分布也是不合理的。为了充分发挥科学家的力量，充分利用研究工作的设备，必须使研究机构尽可能接近研究对象。其次，目前我国正在迅速建立国家所急需的，空白的或薄弱的一些学科。这些学科一般需要复杂巨大的实验设备，它的研究工作的实验部分（甚至某些理论部分）不是少数科学家单独所能进行的，要求科学家集体紧密配合地进行工作。为此，必须集中一批科学家，甚至要求一些科学家在接近原来专长的范围内“改行”，转来从事国家所急需的研究工作。同时，为了支援新建的工业地区和某些少数民族地区的科学文化建设，也需要在这些地区建立新的高等学校和新的科学研究机构，需要一些科学家“离开原来的研究环境”，到这些地方去工作。在初到新的研究环境时，研究工作暂时可能受到一些影响。但是从长远看来，这对我国科学事业的发展好处是更大的。右派分子反对对现有科学力量的必要的调整就是想拉我们科学家的后腿，想打乱党和国家对科学力量的布署，使我国科学工作无法去适应国家社会主义建设的需要。
    右派还极力去宣扬资产阶级“为科学而科学”的错误观点。说什么“强调服务于国家需要就是功利主义，功利主义就一定会妨碍科学的发展”，故意把服从国家需要和科学发展本身的利益对立起来，阻止科学家们去为劳动人民立功，为社会主义国家谋利。所谓“强调服务于生产需要，就会妨碍科学发展”的论调与科学发展的事实也是完全不符的。社会主义国家科学发展的事实我们姑且不说，就拿近代科学与十七八世纪的科学作一个比较，近代科学与社会生活各方面实际的联系，比之十七八世纪要密切得多，要“功利主义”得多。但是，近代科学的发展，比十七八世纪不知快多少。
    要有计划、要有组织
    科学事业要能有成效地服务于社会主义建设，一定要有计划，要有组织。特别像我国这样一个科学比较落后的国家，要想在短时期内赶上世界先进水平，更非如此不可。因为只有这样，才能切合国家需要，使最急需的学科，得到优先的发展。才能根据科学发展的全面情况和趋势，根据各门学科的内在联系，使各门学科得到均衡的发展，才能充分发挥各方面的科学力量。但是，资产阶级右派却竭力宣传说，美国没有全面的计划，也没有系统的组织，科学水平却很高。我国科学要想达到美国的水平，应该走美国的道路。他们故意在人们面前不提这样的事实：美国近代科学发展到现在，经历了一百多年的时间。由于他们没有计划，缺乏组织，在人力上、物力上形成严重的浪费。尽管美国科学有它强大的工业基础的支持，有着长期安定的环境，并且吸收了大批外国科学家，它的发展仍然是缓慢的。反过来看看苏联的情形，苏联在革命前是一个科学比较落后的国家，但是由于充分利用了社会主义制度的优越性，有计划、有组织地发展了他们的科学事业，从而尽管经历了长期残酷的战争，还是能在短短的几十年内，在许多科学部门，特别是在原子能、航空等方面赶上和超过了美国。历史的事实，不是很明显的证明了我国现在发展科学事业的方针的正确么？如果按照右派分子的道路走去，就将使我国科学永远不能摆脱落后的状态，就要使我国工农业生产和国防建设由于缺乏先进的科学技术而处于不利的地位。
    在目前我国科学界中，有这样一种反对有计划地发展我国科学事业的论调，说科学的任务是探索自然界的“未知”，把“未知”加以计划，岂不成了“算命先生”了吗？这种说法似乎有些道理，其实是极其错误的。
    科学研究是探索性的工作，这话不错。但是科学事业的发展，甚至科学成果的获得，并不是完全不能预期的。任何一位有水平的科学家的研究工作，对他个人而言都是有目的、有计划地进行的。只是在资本主义国家中，科学研究如生产一样，因为受资本主义所有制的限制，为各资本家集团的竞争所分割，整个国家的科学工作不可能有计划地进行罢了。社会主义经济是有计划的经济，国家建设对科学的需要通过经济计划的制订大部分都能提得出来。各门科学发展的现状和趋势，经过科学家集体进行认真的分析，基本上可以把握得住。这些就是制订科学工作计划的根据。制订科学事业的发展和科学研究工作的计划是可能的，所谓“算命先生”的说法，只是一种恶意的污蔑。
    当然，我们也强调科学工作的计划有它的特点，不能要求它像生产计划一样，对工作的结果和完成的期限，事先作出硬性的规定。而且对有些科学部门的发展可能事先估计不足，所以在计划之外应该允许一部分科学家进行他们认为值得进行的研究工作，以补计划的不足。但是，决不能因此而否定计划的可能性和必要性。就现在已经制订的1956—1967年科学技术发展远景规划和今年的年度计划来说，虽然它还要根据各种新的情况，不断加以修订和补充，但它所规定的基本方向无疑是正确的。它为我国科学家指出了我国科学技术发展的远景，鼓舞了我国科学家的创造热情。事实证明，它对我国科学事业的发展，已经起了显著的积极作用，今后还会显示出更大的积极作用。
    我国现有的科学体制，是我国科学事业能够有计划、有组织的发展的保证。右派因此也就肆意攻击我国现行的科学工作体制。民盟反社会主义科学纲领特别反对科学院作为全国统一的学术领导的“中心”，反对周总理代表中共中央所作知识分子问题的报告中提出的，必须加强科学院，使它成为提高全国科学水平的“火车头”，并把这种看法污蔑为“主观地先行规定”。近代科学的特点是各门学科的相互联系，相互影响十分密切。国家建设中的重大科学问题，也往往要由许多学科的综合研究才能解决。统一的学术领导，是科学发展所必要的。中国科学院在科学的许多重要的方面进行着研究工作。科学院的学部包括了全国各研究系统中最优秀的科学家。这样的科学院如果不能作为全国学术领导的中心，不能作为提高全国科学水平的“火车头”，那么谁又能作为这种“中心”，这种“火车头”呢？
    曾昭抡、钱伟长等右派分子反对科学院作为全国学术领导的中心还有他们不可告人的目的，这就是希望把科学研究工作完全分散到各高等学校，便利于他们夺取科学事业的领导权。他们的这个企图现在是很清楚地暴露出来了。
        要有党的领导
    党对科学工作的领导，是我国科学事业能够沿着社会主义道路发展的保证。因此，资产阶级右派分子极力反对党对科学工作的领导。他们说什么党对科学是“外行”，“外行”如何能领导“内行”呢？他们还恬不知耻地自称为“内行”，说什么他们最懂得“大知识分子”，科学工作应该由他们来领导。这种言论的荒谬现在已经得到许多人有力的驳斥。我们现在办的是社会主义的科学事业，右派是反对社会主义的，居然是领导社会主义科学事业的内行，这岂不成了天大的笑话。全国科学家对于他们这种内行，已经从民盟的反社会主义科学纲领中领教过了。对于领导社会主义科学事业，右派完全是十足的外行。
    党能不能领导科学呢？党是一个政治组织，党领导科学工作，既不是由党直接去进行科学研究，也不是像科学家安排他的助手的工作那样进行具体的领导，这些工作的确是科学家自己的事情。党对科学的领导主要是：第一，提出发展科学事业的方针、政策，拟定国家发展科学事业的计划以及各种有关科学工作的制度；第二，做好团结、组织、教育、改造科学家的工作，加强对科学研究的马克思列宁主义的思想指导，批判各种错误的学术思想，帮助科学家了解国家的需要，加强和人民的联系；第三，动员和组织各方面的力量去支援科学事业，保证科学家以顺利工作的条件，推动各方面充分利用科学研究的成果，普及科学知识。
    要解决发展社会主义科学事业的方针、政策和计划的问题，就一定要有党的领导。因为只有党能够深切了解国家建设的现状和任务，了解国家建设对科学目前的和长远的、各个方面的需要，能够深切了解整个科学和各门科学发展的现状和趋势，了解科学发展给建设事业开辟的前景，能够懂得怎样的科学工作制度才有利于科学事业的发展。
    要做好团结、组织、教育和改造科学家的工作，和对学术的思想领导工作，就必须有党的领导。因为只有党能够深切了解科学家在国家建设中的作用，了解他们政治态度和思想觉悟的状况，因为只有党能够掌握马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，正确处理政治与学术的关系，正确处理作为自然、社会、思维的一般规律的辩证唯物主义和各门具体科学之间的关系。
    要能做好对科学工作的支援和科学工作的协调、科学成果的推广等工作，也一定要有党的领导。因为只有党能够调动各方面的力量去支援科学工作，协调各方面的关系。
    总之，只有共产党这样一个领导全国人民进行社会主义改造和建设的无产阶级先锋队的政治组织，才能担当得起发展社会主义科学事业的领导责任。
    当然，党对科学工作进行领导的时候是和科学家密切合作的。在工作中走群众路线，是我们党的一贯的工作作风。党与科学家保持经常的接触，同他们进行同志式的讨论，虚心听取他们的意见，接受他们正确的建议。正因为这样，党就能够集中广大科学家的智慧和经验，这是党所以能够领导科学工作的条件之一。
    党对科学工作的领导，很大一部分是必须通过国家机关、企业、学校、科学研究机构、科学团体等组织中的党员干部来实现的。这些组织中担任领导工作的党员很多人不是科学家，他们能不能担当起这种领导工作呢？
    要做好科学工作中的政治思想、方针、政策、计划等方面的领导工作，当然要具有一定的文化水平，事实上，担任这方面工作的党员干部，大体上也是具备这样的文化水平的。但是，像做好其它的领导工作一样，要求于党的领导干部的，首先是他的无产阶级的立场，马克思列宁主义的政治、思想水平和善于联系群众的优良作风和组织工作能力。只要具有上述条件，在担任科学领导工作时，又能虚心学习业务知识和科学知识，努力掌握科学工作的特点，经过一定的时间的经验积累，他们就完全有可能成为党领导科学工作的内行。我们希望将来在科学工作方面担任领导工作的党员本人就是科学家，但这在目前还做不到，需要长时期的努力。
    说只有科学家才能领导科学工作，其错误是明显的。近代科学有各门各类，范围极广。如果说只有科学家才能领导科学工作，那末实际上就不可能有对整个科学工作的领导，甚至不可能有对一个科学部门，一个研究机构的领导。因为即使在一个科学部门，一个研究机构当中，所涉及的科学问题也是非常复杂的，要找一个能够精通许多门类的科学家是非常困难的。
    彻底粉碎右派分子的阴谋，捍卫发展科学事业的社会主义道路
    我国科学事业在党的领导下正沿着社会主义道路前进，并获得很大的成绩。自从去年党中央提出向科学进军的号召以后，我国科学事业更得到飞速的发展。在这种迅速发展的形势前面，我国现有有限的科学力量更加显得不能满足国家建设的需要，科学工作的条件虽然有很大的改善，但是由于受现有工业水平和国家财力的限制，还不能完全满足开展研究的要求。党、政府和担负领导工作的科学家的领导经验，领导科学工作的组织形式、规章、制度也还有不完全适应工作的发展的地方。这些都是科学事业迅速发展中存在的问题。在这次整风运动中，各有关单位的党组织采取了各种形式，邀请科学家对科学工作中的缺点提出批评，希望和科学家一起，共同揭露我国科学工作发展中的矛盾，找出解决矛盾，改进工作的办法。许多科学家，也正是在党的这个号召下，本着改进工作的精神，提出了许多正确的批评和建议。有些批评采取了很尖锐的形式，但对改进工作是有好处的。党和政府会在工作中予以采纳的。当然，有些科学家在所提的意见中，也有不正确的部分。但是，只要他们是从善意出发，党和政府都将以耐心解释和说服的方法对待，并且等待他们在工作实践中逐步改正自己的观点。
    右派分子站在反社会主义立场，他们借着整风的机会向党所领导的科学事业展开猖狂进攻的政治目的，是妄图篡改我国科学工作的方向，夺取对于科学工作的领导权。他们采取的除了前面所说的外，还竭力抹杀在科学工作中进行各项改革的必要，竭力抹杀解放以来科学工作的成绩，宣传什么八年来科学工作“停顿”了，毫无成就可言，一团糟，今后十二年不是赶上国际水平，而是补过去十二年课的问题等等。他们还反对我们提倡学习苏联科学和苏联发展科学事业的先进经验，竭力贬低和抹杀苏联科学的成就，同时却大事宣扬那些不合乎我国社会主义制度的，不利于我国社会主义科学事业发展的资本主义国家科学工作的经验。他们挑拨党和科学家的关系，捏造什么科学家遭到了“浩劫”，提出“保护科学家”的口号，俨然以科学家的“保护者”自居。他们到处宣扬科学家不必进行思想改造，不必学习马列主义。他们反对党在科学家中进行思想政治工作，以便他们散布和扩大资产阶级思想影响。他们挑拨党和青年科学工作人员的关系，煽动他们反对党，起来闹事。他们反对在培养青年干部时，讲究政治条件，竭力在青年中灌输资产阶级思想，企图根本改变我国年青一代科学工作人员成为他们培植反党反社会主义的后备军。他们挑拨在各系统中工作的科学家的关系，特别是科学院和高等学校的科学家之间的关系，并捏造什么党和政府厚此薄彼，破坏科学家和党同政府之间的团结。他们排挤和打击科学机关中的共产党员和靠拢党、坚决拥护社会主义、拥护我国科学事业走社会主义道路的积极分子。
    科学界中的右派分子篡改我国科学事业的社会主义道路，篡夺科学事业的领导权是蓄谋已久。这次是他们阴谋的总暴露。
    现在右派分子向科学事业的进攻已经遭到整个科学界强有力的反击。他们在科学界已经孤立起来了。这时，一部分坚持错误的右派分子又一反前一时期向党向人民举行进攻时穷凶极恶的面貌，把自己假装成只是因为对科学工作提了“意见”而遭到不应有的惩罚的可怜人，背地里还说什么对他们的反社会主义科学纲领的批判是小题大作。他们这样做是企图博得缺乏政治经验的人的同情，并由此向党和人民倒打一耙，说你们容纳不了意见，对提意见的人进行报复。他们的用心是恶毒的。
    右派先生们真是因为对科学工作提了意见就受到科学界和全国人民对他们的声讨么？你们并不是对科学工作提什么意见，而是借着整风的机会到处兴风作浪，到处点火，行他们篡改发展科学事业的道路，篡夺对科学工作的领导权之实。至于善意的意见，请你们不必耽心，我们是会看得出来，加以研究和采纳的。
    对右派分子的反社会主义科学纲领进行批判真是小题大作么？如本文前面所分析的反社会主义的科学纲领，和其他右派分子的许多有关言论，涉及到的是发展我国科学事业的大是大非的问题。如果按照右派分子所设计的资本主义道路来发展我国的科学事业，就将使我国科学事业永远永远不能摆脱落后的状况，更谈不上十二年内赶上世界水平，就将使我国在当前社会主义国家与帝国主义国家所展开的、激烈的、尖锐的科学竞赛中无法作出贡献，就将使我国的工农业生产和国防建设由于缺乏近代科学技术而处于不利的地位。面对着这样的大是大非，我国科学界难道不该对右派分子展开坚决的批判么？难道我们不应该起来坚决捍卫关系国家命运的、发展科学事业的社会主义道路么？
    目前我国科学家为了捍卫社会主义，正在与资产阶级右派分子展开了坚决的斗争。这场斗争不但粉碎了右派分子向党、向人民、向社会主义的猖狂进攻，而且通过这一场斗争，使我们科学家更加认识到努力改造自己的思想的必要，更加坚定了自己为劳动人民服务，为社会主义服务的立场，更加明确了发展科学事业的社会主义道路。我国科学家将在党和政府的领导下，满怀信心地沿着社会主义道路迈进。
