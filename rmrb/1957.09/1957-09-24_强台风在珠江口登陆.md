    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 23rd. The center of a strong typhoon from the South China Sea landed in the Pearl River Estuary of Guangdong Province at 8:00 PM yesterday with winds of force 10, and moved northwest towards the Foshan and Gao Yao districts. The typhoon brought heavy rain, with some areas receiving as much as 300 millimeters of rain in a short period of time. Although the local people and garrison troops made every effort to rescue the crops, the tall sugarcane and early-maturing late rice still suffered losses, and some telephone lines were broken. Some areas of Enping and Taishan counties west of the Pearl River Estuary were flooded. The disaster was lighter in Bao'an, Dongguan, Huiyang, and Haifeng counties east of the Pearl River Estuary.
    This afternoon, the typhoon continued to move northwest, but the wind force has weakened to below force 6.

    强台风在珠江口登陆
    新华社广州23日电　南海强台风中心昨日晚八时以十级风力在广东省珠江口登陆后，向西北方向的佛山、高要专区移动。台风带来了暴雨，有些地区短时间内落雨竟达三百公厘。虽然当地人民和驻军竭力抢救，但是长得很高的甘蔗和早熟晚稻仍受到损失，部分电话线被吹断。珠江口以西的恩平、台山等县部分地区受淹。珠江口以东的宝安、东莞、惠阳、海丰等县受灾较轻。
    今天下午，台风继续向西北方向移动，但风力已减弱到六级以下。
