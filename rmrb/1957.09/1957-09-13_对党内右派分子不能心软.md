　　One Must Not Be Soft on Rightists Within the Party
　　Xu Bangyi
    With the deepening of the anti-Rightist struggle, a group of Rightists hidden within the Party have been exposed one after another. This matter is of utmost significance. Exposing Rightists within the Party, firstly, allows people to recognize the true faces of these anti-Party elements, preventing them from being deceived and misled, and thus safeguarding the Party's cause from harm; secondly, it further consolidates the unity and unification of the entire Party, making the Party an even stronger vanguard than before, more closely connected with the masses, and more capable of leading the masses towards victory; thirdly, it allows every Party member to draw profound lessons and receive practical education on who can become a Communist Party member and how to be a Communist Party member, which will further elevate the title of Party member and purify the Party ranks. It is truly a multi-beneficial endeavor. Whether viewed from the immediate or the long-term perspective, exposing Rightists within the Party is indeed a very good thing.

    This is a good thing, but not an easy one. This is due not only to the fact that Rightists within the Party are better at disguising themselves and more adaptable to the environment, but also to the fact that some of our comrades have a bit of "pity" and "leniency" towards them, or are a bit soft-hearted and weak-handed. In particular, some comrades, seeing that some anti-Party elements have two or thirty years of Party membership, are "old Party members" and "old cadres," feel even more reluctant and have even more warmth.

    Undoubtedly, old Party members and old cadres are the wealth of the Party and the state, and should be cherished and respected. The vast majority of old Party members and old cadres in our Party are also time-tested and infinitely loyal, and can truly withstand great storms. However, the facts also tell us that in the new historical period, there are indeed some "old Party members" and "old cadres" in our Party who have degenerated and deteriorated. People like Feng Xuefeng, Ding Ling, and Liu Peizhi, although they have two or thirty years of Party membership, have now fallen into the shameful anti-Party quagmire. We must first affirm this point; this is a qualitative change, they have changed from Party members to enemies within the Party. Only by clarifying and defining the nature of the contradiction can we eliminate "warmth" and give those monsters and demons full exposure and a powerful blow.

    Speaking of "old," since they are "old" Party members and "old" cadres, they should be stronger in Party spirit, more stable in their stance, and should perform even better. "Old" should not mean standing on the opposite side of the Party, stirring up trouble, and fearing that the world is not in chaos. "Old" does not give one any special privileges to oppose the Party. Can two or thirty years of Party membership be used as capital for opposing the Party? Does being "old" mean that one is not subject to the Party's discipline? There is no such party in the world that would allow its "old" members to engage in anti-Party activities. Any "old" Party member who has anti-Party words and deeds should be sanctioned by the Party; this is a matter of course. Otherwise, what kind of Communist Party would it be?

    In short, one must be equally ruthless towards Rightists within the Party. Communist Party members cannot be Mr. Dongguo. If they are not fully exposed and are allowed to hide, then they will use magic to climb up, level by level, and the consequences will be unimaginable.

### 对党内右派分子不能心软

　　对党内右派分子不能心软
　　许邦仪
    随着反右派斗争的深入，党内隐藏着的一批右派分子已经纷纷被揭露出来了。这件事具有极重要的意义。把党内的右派分子揭露出来，第一，可以使人们认清楚这些反党分子的真面目，不再受其欺骗和迷惑，党的事业也就可以免于受到危害；其二，使全党的团结和统一进一步巩固起来，会使党成为比以往更强大、更与群众密切联系和更加能引导群众走向胜利的先锋队；其三，可以使每个党员吸取到深刻的教训，并受到一次究竟什么人可以成为共产党员和怎样做一个共产党员的实际教育，这会使党员的称号更加提高，使党的队伍更加纯洁。真是一举数得。无论是从眼前看，无论是从长远看，揭发党内右派分子这件事，确实是好得很。
    这是件好事，但并非易事。这除了由于党内的右派分子更善于伪装，更会适应环境，还由于我们有些同志对于他们有点儿“怜恤”和“姑息”，或者有点儿心软和手软。特别是有些同志看到有一些反党分子有二、三十年党龄、是“老党员”和“老干部”，就有点更不忍心了，就更有点儿温情了。
    无疑的，老党员和老干部是党和国家的财富，是应当爱惜和受到尊重的。我们党内绝大多数老党员和老干部又是久经考验和无限忠诚的，是真正经得起大风大浪的。可是，事实又告诉我们：在新的历史时期，我们党内确实有一些“老党员”和“老干部”是蜕化了的，是变了质的。像冯雪峰、丁玲、刘培植等人，他们虽有二、三十年党龄，如今他们却堕落到可耻的反党泥坑里去。我们首先要肯定这一点，这是一个质变，他们是从党员变为党内的敌人。只有把矛盾的性质弄清楚和弄明确了，才能消除“温情”，也才能给那些牛鬼蛇神以充分的揭露和有力的打击。
    谈到“老”，既然是“老”党员和“老”干部，就理应党性更强，立场更稳，也就理应表现得更好。“老”，那就不应站在党的对立面，来兴风作浪，唯恐天下不乱。“老”，更没有反党的特权。难道二、三十年党龄可以作为反党的本钱吗？难道因为“老”就可以不受党的管教吗？天地间是找不到这样一个党，是可以允许自己的“老”党员进行反党活动的。任何一个“老”党员有了反党的言和行，就应受到党的制裁，这是天经地义。否则，那还叫做什么共产党呢？
    总之，对于党内右派分子，同样要狠心。共产党员是不可以做一个东郭先生的。如果不把他们充分揭露出来，容忍他们隐藏，那末，他们就会运用法术，一级一级地爬上去，后患就不堪设想了。
