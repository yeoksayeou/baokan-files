　　How Much Economic Support Does the State Provide to Farmers?

　　Rightist elements have greatly provoked the relationship between the state and farmers, saying that the state only takes things from the farmers, exploits them, that farmers' lives are very hard, and that they are "on the verge of starvation," and so on. Is this really the case? In fact, in order to develop agricultural production and improve farmers' lives, the state's economic support for farmers is quite significant. (Of course, China's industrialization has just begun, and the state cannot yet allocate more money to agriculture.) Facts speak louder than words, please see the following materials:

　　Agricultural Investment: In the seven years from 1950 to 1956, the state invested a total of 3.07 billion yuan in basic water conservancy construction, issued approximately 1.31 billion yuan in disaster relief and aid, and used approximately 1.28 billion yuan to promote improved varieties, new agricultural tools, and improve agricultural production technology. The above three items total approximately 5.66 billion yuan, which is more than 35% of the 16 billion yuan in agricultural taxes paid by farmers in the seven years. Taking the Huai River as an example, everyone knows that the banks of the Huai River have historically been a disaster area of "major disasters in heavy rain and minor disasters in light rain." After liberation, in order to fundamentally control the Huai River, the state invested as much as 800 million yuan, built seven large mountain valley reservoirs, and twelve larger lake and depression flood storage projects. These projects can store a total of more than 28.5 billion cubic meters of floodwater. At the same time, the length of large and small river channels dredged and reorganized reached more than 7,600 kilometers, and the dikes including the Huai River embankment were reorganized for more than 5,800 kilometers. The areas where the Huai River harnessing project has been carried out can basically ensure a good harvest in spring and autumn in normal rainfall years.

　　Agricultural Loans: In the seven years from 1950 to 1956, the state issued a cumulative total of more than 8 billion yuan in agricultural loans. By the end of 1956, 3.03 billion yuan in agricultural loans had not yet been recovered, exceeding the 1955 agricultural tax revenue by more than 22 million yuan.

　　Technical Assistance: The state's assistance in developing agricultural technology has also been very successful in recent years. Please see the following two tables:

　　Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow  Units  351  7,694 17,804   368,315  1,070,000
　　Chemical Fertilizers  Tons  295,088  555,209  807,833  1,174,918  1,620,000
　　Pesticides  Tons  1,717  15,276  41,286  67,397  160,000

　　In addition, in the seven years from 1950 to 1956, the state also established a total of 228 agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry higher and secondary schools and colleges, cultivating a total of more than 93,000 students, who have become a huge technical force on the agricultural front. At the same time, 210 scientific research institutions and 14,499 agricultural technology extension stations were established. In addition, from 1952 to 1956, the state supplied farmers with a total of 2.77 million units of double-wheel double (single) share plows, double-wheel "harvesters," seeders and other agricultural machinery and new agricultural tools, 5.3 million tons of chemical fertilizers, 170,000 tons of agricultural pesticides, and 2.53 million units of agricultural machinery. These measures have played a significant role in helping farmers improve agricultural production. (Domestic Materials Group of this Newspaper)

### 国家对农民经济支持有多大？

专栏：数字与事实

　　国家对农民经济支持有多大？
    右派分子曾经大肆挑拨国家同农民的关系，说国家光是从农民手里拿东西，剥削了农民，农民生活很苦，“濒于饥饿的边缘”等等。难道事实真是这样吗？事实上国家为了发展农业生产、提高农民生活，对农民的经济支援数字是相当不小的。（当然，我国工业化建设刚开始不久，国家还不可能拿出更多的钱来投放在农业方面。）事实胜于雄辩，请看下列材料：
    农业投资：从1950年到1956年的七年中，国家投入水利基本建设的经费共达三十点七亿元，发放救灾和救济的经费约有十三点一亿元，用于推广优良品种、新式农具，提高农业生产技术等经费约有十二点八亿元，以上三项共计约五十六点六亿元，这个数字约等于农民在七年中交纳的农业税款一百六十亿元的35％强。仅以淮河为例，大家都知道淮河两岸在历史上就是“大雨大灾、小雨小灾”的重灾区。解放后，国家为了根治淮河，共投资达八亿元之多，修建了大型山谷水库七座，较大的湖泊洼地蓄洪工程十二处。这些工程共可拦蓄洪水二百八十五亿多公方。同时疏竣整理大小河道长度共达七千六百多公里，整理包括淮河大堤在内的堤防五千八百多公里。已经进行治淮工程的地区，在一般年份降雨情况下，基本上春秋两季，都可保收。
    农业贷款：  从1950年到1956年的七年中，国家先后发放的农业贷款累计数字共为八十多亿元，到1956年底还没收回的农业贷款就达三十点三亿元，超过1955年农业税的收入二千二百多万元。
    技术援助：  国家对发展农业技术的帮助，几年的成绩也是很大的。请看下面两个表：
　　农业拖拉机站发展情况
　　      单位  1953年  1954年  1955年  1956年
　　站数  个    11      89      138     326
　　拖拉机台数  标准台  113 778  2,377  9,862
　　新式农具、农药、化肥的推广
　　      单位  1952年  1953年  1954年  1955年  1956年
　　双轮双铧犁  部  351  7,694 17,804   368,315  1,070,000
　　化学肥料  吨  295,088  555,209  807,833  1,174,918  1,620,000
　　农药  吨  1,717  15,276  41,286  67,397  160,000
    此外，在1950年到1956年的七年中，国家还一共办了二百二十八所农、林、渔、牧高等和中等学校、学院，共培养出九万三千多名学生，他们已经成为一支农业战线上的庞大的技术力量。同时，建立了二百一十所科学研究机构和一万四千四百九十九处农业技术推广站。此外，国家从1952年到1956年供给农民双轮双（单）铧犁，双轮“收割机”、播种机等农业机械和新式农具共二百七十七万架，化学肥料五百三十万吨，农用药剂十七万吨，农用药械二百五十三万架。这些措施在帮助农民提高农业生产上都起了很大作用。（本报国内资料组）
