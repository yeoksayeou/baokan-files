Beijing's Industrial Products Companies are actively preparing winter goods for consumers. As early as May, various specialized companies began arranging production and organizing transportation of goods such as cotton clothing, cotton-padded coats, cotton shoes, and stoves. By the end of this month, there will be sufficient supply to meet market demand. In order to implement the spirit of thrift, 75,000 of the 100,000 stoves prepared this year are dual-purpose briquette stoves. Among the cotton clothes prepared this year are cotton uniforms made of tussah silk, cotton vests, cotton-padded coats with nylon surfaces and tussah silk linings, and other varieties. To ensure the availability of dry coal briquettes in winter, the Beijing Coal and Construction Company is mobilizing its employees to actively produce them. It is estimated that by the end of this month, more than 300,000 tons of coal briquettes will be produced, more than double the inventory of the same period last year. From September to December this year, there will also be a relatively ample supply of dark-colored printed cloth, with newer patterns as well.
