    East Scale, West Claw
    Won the Championship
    The State-owned Jinan Locomotive Repair Factory recently received a notice from the Factory Management Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. In the second quarter of this year, the factory won first place in the national railway factory socialist inter-factory competition. In addition to being awarded a rotating red flag for excellence, it will also receive a bonus of 11,500 yuan.
      Stuck with it
    In early May, the Communist Youth League Committee of the Ministry of Chemical Industry organized its departments, bureaus, and design institutes' members to voluntarily participate in dishwashing labor in the canteen. For several months, ten to fifty people went to the main canteen to wash dishes every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. In early July, the General Office of the Ministry of Chemical Industry also organized bureau-level cadres to wash dishes in the main canteen every Saturday. This labor has now become a regular practice. (Ding Lizhi)
      Storing Fresh Fish and Shrimp
    Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, September 5th: A cold storage plant affiliated with the state-owned Qingdao Aquatic Products Company of Shandong Province began construction on the 2nd.
    This cold storage plant is designed according to the latest Soviet design standards and has five layers of warehouses for cooling, freezing, and quick-freezing. After completion, the daily freezing capacity can reach more than 130 tons, which is more than one and a half times the capacity of the company's existing cold storage equipment.
    Qingdao is a production and distribution center for fish and shrimp. After the cold storage plant is completed in October next year, it will store more fresh fish and shrimp to supply exports and the domestic people.
