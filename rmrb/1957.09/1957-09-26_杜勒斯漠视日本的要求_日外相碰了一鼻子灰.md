Xinhua News Agency, Washington: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama said at a press conference on the 24th that Japan's proposal to the UN General Assembly to halt nuclear weapons testing was a "compromise" between the Western and Soviet positions. He said he had specifically explained this proposal to Dulles during their meeting.

Regarding the development of Sino-Japanese trade, Fujiyama said that one of Japan's most important tasks is to expand its foreign trade.

Fujiyama pointed out that US-Japan trade has brought about a deficit for Japan. He said: Japan currently buys $1 billion worth of goods from the United States annually, but only sells half that amount to the United States, creating a $500 million dollar deficit.

He said that in his talks with Dulles, he also discussed the return of residents to Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, the release of Japanese war criminals, and the "development" of Southeast Asia. Fujiyama said that the United States has not yet made a formal response to Japan's proposal for US-Japan cooperation in the "development" of Southeast Asia.

According to Kyodo News, the meeting does not seem to have achieved the results expected by the Japanese side. In particular, regarding the request that the United States return administrative and educational control of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan, as well as the issue of the return of residents to the Ogasawara Islands, even Fujiyama himself said after the meeting: "Dulles's views on these two groups of islands are pessimistic."

Prior to this, Aiichiro Fujiyama and Dulles issued a joint statement on the 23rd after their meeting. The content of the statement was roughly the same as the issues listed in Fujiyama's remarks above.

    杜勒斯漠视日本的要求
    日外相碰了一鼻子灰
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎24日在记者招待会上说，日本向联大提出的停止核武器试验的建议是西方的主张和苏联的主张的“折衷”。他说，他在同杜勒斯会谈中特别就这个建议作了说明。
    藤山在谈到发展中日贸易的时候说，日本的最主要任务之一是扩大它的对外贸易。
    藤山指出，日美贸易给日本带来了逆差。他说：日本现在每年自美国购买价值十亿美元的货物，但是出售给美国的只有那个数目的一半，形成五亿美元的美元赤字。
    他说，他在同杜勒斯的会谈中还谈到让冲绳岛和小笠原群岛居民回乡、释放日本战犯以及“开发”东南亚等问题。藤山说，对于日本提出的美日合作“开发”东南亚的计划，美国还没有作出正式答复。
    据共同社说：这次会谈似乎没有获得日本方面所预期的成果。特别是关于要求美国把琉球群岛的行政权和教育权还给日本以及小笠原群岛居民回乡问题，甚至藤山本人在会谈后也说：“杜勒斯关于这两个群岛的意见是令人悲观的。”
    在这以前，藤山爱一郎23日同杜勒斯在会谈后发表了联合声明。声明的内容和以上藤山的谈话所列举的问题大致相同。
