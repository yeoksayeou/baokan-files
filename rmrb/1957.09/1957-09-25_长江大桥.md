    Yangtze River Bridge
    Guo Moruo
    A steel belt has fastened the Yangtze's waist,
    Completing it today, two years ahead of schedule.
    A poet likened it to a bamboo flute,
    But I find that comparison too delicate.
    Most people love to compare it to a long rainbow,
    But I feel that too is not quite right.
    A long rainbow is a semi-circular arc,
    Somewhat like an old-fashioned arched bridge,
    But this, is a flat and open straight line.
    A long rainbow has layers of color, vanishing in a flash,
    But this, is a steel-frame structure, forever strong.
    But then I compare it to a belt,
    Is that good? No, not really.
    Then, let me say it without embellishment:
    It's beyond compare, don't waste your efforts,
    It is, it is, a Yangtze River Bridge!
    The ancients once said: the Yangtze is a natural chasm,
    A natural boundary between the South and the North.
    Though some tried to stop the advance on the water,
    Blocking it with thousand-fathom iron chains across the river,
    They ultimately couldn't withstand Wang Jun's war junks.
    Though some reined in their horses at the river's edge,
    Boasting that the surging torrent could be halted by throwing in whips,
    They only earned a reputation for fear and retreated to Jiugong Mountain in defeat.
    Recalling the Northern Expedition when Wuhan was captured,
    I too once had such a thought:
    To write a large slogan across the river--
    "Down with imperialism, eradicate feudalism!"
    But that wishful thinking was in vain.
    Tell me, back then where could you
    Find the platform to write this slogan?
    Thirty years have passed since the Northern Expedition,
    My beautiful dream has finally come true,
    Writing the slogan is no longer difficult,
    Yet imperialism and feudalism
    Have long been completely overthrown.
    "The Chinese people have stood up!"
    Chairman Mao's declaration has resounded in every direction.
    "The Chinese people have stood up!"
    Chairman Mao's declaration has resounded in all directions.
    The Chinese people thank the Party, support the Party, love the Party,
    It is the Party that liberated the people's productive forces.
    The achievements of the past eight years are truly magnificent,
    After the Three Great Transformations and the Five Great Movements,
    China has completely changed its appearance.
    The Party is the savior of the Chinese people,
    The Party is the sun of the Chinese people.
    China is a united family of nationalities and democracy,
    Six hundred million people are like brothers and sisters.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the whole people struggle together,
    Even the Yangtze River's natural chasm has been bridged,
    Who says there is any gap between the Party and the masses,
    Who says there is any wall between the Party and the masses?
    The Yangtze River Bridge is a milestone of eight years of construction,
    Has there ever been such a magnificent construction in history?
    Though the Great Wall is a world wonder,
    Its existence is only as a war ruin.
    Of course, we also have the Yellow River Bridge and the Pearl River Bridge,
    But the difficulty of the project cannot be compared to either.
    The Yangtze River Bridge is a new-style double-layer structure,
    The lower level is laid with railways, and the upper level is open to cars.
    Whenever the bright moon hangs in the sky, people linger on the bridge,
    Admiring the clear river like silk, reflecting the bright light.
    This new appreciation is unprecedented,
    This new appreciation will evoke new intoxication.
    The tortoise and snake that have been separated for billions of years,
    Have been connected by the people, stretching out their steel arms.
    The Yellow Crane Tower has increased its height,
    The Qingchuan Pavilion has restored its tranquility.
    If the poet Li Bai were alive today,
    He would create new poems, without shame compared to Cui Hao.
    Who says the Party cannot lead?
    Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
    Who says achievements are not primary?
    Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
    Who says Soviet technology is not superb?
    Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
    Who says the Sino-Soviet alliance is not needed?
    Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
    Without the leadership of the Party and the help of the Soviet Union,
    How could this bridge be built so quickly, economically, and well?
    This bridge is a thoroughfare from North to South, and from South to North,
    This bridge is also a thoroughfare to socialism.
    The Five-Star Red Flag shines on the bridgehead fort,
    Attracting pedestrians and vehicles on the bridge,
    Also attracting ships and sails under the bridge,
    Together heading towards the communist tomorrow,
    Not arrogant at all, not impatient at all.

### 长江大桥

    长江大桥
    郭沫若
    一条铁带拴上了长江的腰，
    在今天竟提前两年完成了。
    有位诗人把它比成洞箫，
    我觉得比得过于纤巧。
    一般人又爱把它比成长虹，
    我觉也一样不见佳妙。
    长虹是一个半圆的弧形，
    旧式的拱桥倒还勉强相肖，
    但这，却是坦坦荡荡的一条。
    长虹彩色层层，瞬息消逝，
    但这，是钢骨结构，永远坚牢。
    但我又把它比成腰带，
    这可好吗？不，也不太好。
    那吗，就让我不加修饰地说吧：
    它是难可比拟的，不要枉费心机，
    它就是，它就是，一座长江大桥！
    古人曾经说：长江是天堑，
    是南方和北方的天然界限。
    虽然有人想阻止水上的进军，
    封锁以千寻的横江铁链，
    但终于抵挡不住王浚的楼船。
    虽然也有人勒马临江，
    放言滚滚宏流、投鞭可断，
    但只赢得风声鹤唳、败退九公山。
    回想北伐当年攻下了武汉，
    我也曾做过这样的想念：
    横江写他一个大标语——
    “打倒帝国主义，铲除封建！”
    但这空想也只是徒然。
    请问，在当时你能从哪儿
    找出写上这个标语的台栈？
    北伐以来整整三十年了，
    我的美梦竟终于实现，
    要写上标语已经毫不困难，
    然而帝国主义和封建主义
    早已被彻底推翻。
    “中国人民已经站起来了！”
    毛主席的宣告已响遍四方八面。
    “中国人民已经站起来了！”
    毛主席的宣告已响遍四面八方。
    中国人民感谢党、拥护党、爱党，
    是党把人民的生产力解放。
    八年来的成就真是万丈光芒，
    经过三大改造、五大运动，
    使中国完全改变了模样。
    党是中国人民的救星，
    党是人民中国的太阳。
    中国是民族的民主大家庭，
    六亿人民就和兄弟姊妹一样。
    在党领导下全民共同奋斗，
    连长江天堑都已经架上桥梁，
    谁说党群之间有什么沟，
    谁说党群之间有什么墙？
    长江大桥是八年建设的里程碑，
    历史上的建设几曾有这样雄伟？
    万里长城虽然是世界的奇观，
    但它的存在只是作为战争的废垒。
    当然，我们也有黄河大桥、珠江大桥，
    但工程的艰巨，两者都不能比配。
    长江大桥是双层的新式建筑，
    下层敷设铁路，上层可通汽车。
    每当皓月当空，人们在桥上低回，
    欣赏着澄江如练，反映着明辉。
    新的欣赏是前无古人，
    新的欣赏会引起新的陶醉。
    亿万年被隔断着的龟与蛇，
    被人民联系了起来，舒展着铁臂。
    黄鹤楼增加了它的崔巍，
    晴川阁恢复了它的静美。
    诗人李白如果生在今天，
    他会产生出新诗，于崔颢无愧。
    谁说党不能领导？
    请看这长江大桥！
    谁说成绩不是主要？
    请看这长江大桥！
    谁说苏联的技术并不高超？
    请看这长江大桥！
    谁说中苏联盟可以不要？
    请看这长江大桥！
    如果没有党的领导、苏联的帮助，
    这座桥怎能建设得又快、又省、又好？
    这座桥是由北而南、由南而北的大道，
    这座桥也是通往社会主义的大道。
    五星红旗在桥头堡上辉耀，
    招引着桥上的行人车辆，
    也招引桥下的船舶帆篙，
    一同走向共产主义的明天，
    一点也不虚骄，一点也不急躁。
