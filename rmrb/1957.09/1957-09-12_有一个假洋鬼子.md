There is a fake foreign devil,
　　He has a foreign name,
　　Called something like Tata Mullin,
　　Everyone knows, everyone's aware.
　　He is more humble than anyone,
　　Looks down on his own motherland,
　　Living together with Chinese people,
　　He says he's crawled into a doghouse.
　　Speaking of foreign moons,
　　He likes them more than the Chinese ones,
　　The banks are also better in England,
　　Where he deposited two thousand pounds.
　　One thing makes him the most sad,
　　That's to blame the Eight-Nation Alliance of the time,
　　Since they had already reached Beijing,
　　Why didn't they carve up China?
　　He really misses Taiwan,
　　It must be a good place now,
　　In the past it was thanks to the "Taijun" (Japanese soldiers),
　　Today we must thank American parents.
　　Speaking of the country of American imperialism,
　　It is full of "immortals",
　　How much he wants to seek immortality there,
　　But he can't find a ship to save all living beings.
　　This Chinese fake foreign devil,
　　He is really troubled in his heart,
　　No matter how good the new China is,
　　It's not worth a smile compared to the "immortal land".
　　Poor fake foreign devil,
　　He has to deal with "Chinese" people,
　　He uses his cane to knock on his ancestors' graves,
　　Why doesn't his nose grow taller?

　　有一个假洋鬼子
　　金近
　　有个假洋鬼子，
　　他有个外国名字，
　　叫什么塔塔木林，
　　哪个不晓，哪个不知。
　　他比谁都谦虚，
　　瞧不起自己的祖国，
　　跟中国人住在一起，
　　他说是钻进了狗窝。
　　谈起外国的月亮，
　　要比中国的喜欢，
　　银行也是英国的好，
　　在那里放进两千镑存款。
　　有一件事最使他伤心，
　　那要怪当时的八国联军，
　　既然打到了北京城，
　　为什么不把中国瓜分？
　　他真是想念台湾，
　　现在一定是个好地方，
　　过去是“太君”的功劳，
　　今天要感谢美国爹娘。
　　说起美帝这个国家，
　　那里住满了“神仙”，
　　他多么想去求仙啊，
　　可惜找不到普渡众生的船。
　　这个中国的假洋鬼子，
　　他心里实在烦恼，
　　新中国不管有多好，
　　比起“仙国”就不值得一笑。
　　可怜的假洋鬼子啊，
　　偏偏要跟“华人”打交道，
　　他拿手杖去敲祖宗的坟，
　　为什么他的鼻子长不高？
