Ai Qing Long Engaged With Reactionary Groups

The meeting revealed that during the period of "blooming and contending," Ai Qing not only colluded with "Wenhui Bao" reporters and rightists Mei Duo and Yao Fangzao, telling them the so-called "two bottoms of the literary and art circles," slandering the Party's criticism of Ding, Chen, and Jiang Feng as "factionalism within the Party," and inciting "Wenhui Bao" to attack the Party; but also, for a long time, shuttled between the Ding, Chen, Jiang Feng, and Wu Zuguang anti-Party groups and the right-wing groups, spreading anti-Party remarks and disseminating information for them.

Ai Qing went everywhere to "cry injustice" for Ding Ling and "complain" for Ding Ling. Ding Ling often learned about various situations and decided on countermeasures through Ai Qing. At the beginning of the rectification movement, Ding Ling said to Ai Qing: "I will remain silent first and not speak, so that they (referring to the Party) cannot find out my bottom line." She also said: "Ai Qing, when you speak, you can tell them that you are afraid, dare not express opinions, and fear retaliation." And said that she herself would say this. Ding Ling also told Ai Qing the news that the Party was going to investigate Jiang Feng, and instructed Ai Qing to tell Jiang Feng: "You can't talk nonsense now." Ai Qing acted according to Ding Ling's instructions.

In order to cover up their anti-Party activities, Ding Ling and Chen Qixia sometimes did not communicate directly, but Ai Qing served as a messenger to pass on information. Ai Qing also sympathized with Chen Qixia and felt injustice for Chen Qixia's criticism by the Party.

Ai Qing and Li Youran were anti-Party "old friends" who often cursed the Party's leadership together. Ai Qing and Jiang Feng were even closer than brothers. After Jiang Feng was criticized by the Party, Ai Qing said everywhere that this was the Party "wanting to politically beat Jiang Feng to death with one blow." This year in May, Jiang Feng incited a group of painters to carry their oil paintings to the Ministry of Culture to demonstrate. The day before the demonstration, a group of people from the Jiang Feng group gathered to plot this matter, and this gathering took place at Ai Qing's home.

Ai Qing and Wu Zuguang were "frank" with each other. In front of Wu Zuguang, he slandered the Party as being gloomy and terrifying, saying that "there is no democracy in the Party," "there is no warmth in the Party," and said: "It's better that you are not a Party member," "The Party is ruthless and specializes in rectifying people." He expressed to Wu Zuguang that he regretted joining the Party and was not free after joining the Party. He also said: "What are the benefits of joining the Party? Aren't you still being pointed at and scolded?" He even disregarded Party discipline and revealed many Party secrets to Wu Zuguang, even Wu Zuguang said: "If I report to the organization what Ai Qing has said to me, Ai Qing will surely be expelled from the Party." Ai Qing even spread absurd remarks such as "it is difficult to be a person in the Party" and "a group of people rectify people, and a group of people are rectified" at Party meetings.

The meeting pointed out that the root of Ai Qing's anti-Party thought is rooted in the extremely decadent quagmire of bourgeois individualism. For more than ten years since Ai Qing joined the Party, he has always put the individual above the Party. He often said that he was already a "famous writer" and "great poet" before he joined the Party. Therefore, he believed that he was "capitalized," that his joining the Party brought "honor" to the Party, that he could bargain with the Party and regard himself as a special Party member. The Party gave him important positions, but he was not satisfied, saying that he was "squeezed out in the literary and art circles" and "couldn't get along in the Party, and was a supporting role." He sang the same tune as Ding Ling, believing that he had written poems and published collections, so he was not afraid of anything. When he made mistakes, the Party could not touch him either. He once said to Wu Zuguang: "If I make a mistake, the Party can't do anything to me. I have a position in the international community, and the Party has to consider the impact." Of course, the Party could not unconditionally accommodate him, so he was dissatisfied with the Party, slandering the Party for attacking him, and saying that he was "living in adversity."

Ai Qing is also extremely bad in terms of moral character. He has always played with women and is morally corrupt. The Party has repeatedly severely criticized him and educated him, but he not only did not thank the Party for saving him, but was dissatisfied with the Party.

The meeting pointed out that Ai Qing's recent creations have become increasingly lacking in revolutionary and life breath; he once wrote some good poems in the stage of democratic revolution, but because his serious individualism has not been transformed for a long time, he cannot sing for socialism in the stage of socialist revolution. He can only turn over a new leaf, thoroughly repent, and then he can have a future in politics and creation.

### 丁玲的伙伴、李又然的老友、江丰的手足、吴祖光的知心  艾青长期奔走于反动集团之间

    丁玲的伙伴、李又然的老友、江丰的手足、吴祖光的知心
    艾青长期奔走于反动集团之间
    会上揭露：在大鸣大放期间，艾青不但勾结“文汇报”的记者、右派分子梅朵、姚芳藻，告诉他们所谓“文艺界的两个底”，诬蔑党批评丁、陈和江丰是“党内宗派主义”，挑动“文汇报”向党进攻；而且，长期以来奔走在丁、陈、江丰、吴祖光反党集团和右派集团之间，散布反党言论，并为他们传播消息。
    艾青到处为丁玲“喊冤”，替丁玲“诉苦”。丁玲常常通过艾青，了解各方面的情况，决定对策。整风运动开始时，丁玲对艾青说： “我先沉默，不发言，叫他们（指党）摸不到我的底。”并说：“艾青呵，你发言时可以告诉他们，怕，不敢提意见，怕报复。”并说她自己就这样说。丁玲还把党要审查江丰的消息告诉艾青，嘱咐艾青去转告江丰：“现在不能乱说”。艾青都一一按丁玲的嘱咐行事。
    丁玲和陈企霞为了掩盖他们的反党活动，有时不直接来往，曾由艾青通风报信，传递消息。艾青也十分同情陈企霞，为陈企霞受党的批评抱不平。
    艾青和李又然是反党“老朋友”，他们常在一起谩骂党的领导。艾青和江丰更是亲如手足。江丰受到党的批评后，艾青到处说，这是党“要在政治上一棍子打死江丰”。今年5月，江丰煽动了一批画家，抬着他们的油画到文化部去示威。示威的头一天，江丰集团的一部分人聚会密谋此事，这个聚会就是在艾青家里进行的。
    艾青和吴祖光在一起是“无话不说”的。在吴祖光面前，他诬蔑党内阴森恐怖，说“党内没有民主”，“党内没有温暖”，并说：“你不是党员还好点”，“党是无情的，专整人。”他向吴祖光表示：后悔入党，入了党不自由。还说：“入党有啥好处，入了党还不是被人家指着鼻子骂。”他甚至不顾党纪，把许多党的秘密泄露给吴祖光，连吴祖光都说：“如果我把艾青对我说过的话报告给组织，艾青准会被开除党籍。”艾青甚至在党的会议上，也散布“党内做人难”，“一批人整人，一批人挨整”等荒谬言论。
    会上指出：艾青的反党思想的根，是扎在他那极端腐朽的资产阶级个人主义的泥坑里。艾青入党十多年来，一直把个人摆在党的上面。他常常说，他入党前已经是一位“名作家”“大诗人”了。因此，他认为自己是“有资本”的，他的入党是给党带来了“荣誉”，他可以向党讨价还价，以特殊党员自居。党给他重要的工作岗位，他不满足，说他“在文艺界是受排挤的”，“在党内吃不开，是个跑龙套的角色。”他和丁玲唱一个调调，认为他写了诗，出了集子，他就一切都不怕。当他犯了错误的时候，党也不能碰他。他曾对吴祖光说：“我犯了错误，党也不能怎样我，我在国际上有地位，党也得考虑影响。”党当然不能无原则地迁就他，他就对党心怀不满，诬蔑党打击他，说他是“生活在逆境中”。
    艾青在道德品质方面，也是极端恶劣的。他一贯玩弄女性、道德败坏。党一再严厉地批评他，教育他，他不但不感谢党对他的挽救，反而对党不满。
    会上指出，艾青近年来的创作越来越缺少革命和生活的气息；他在民主主义革命阶段，曾经写过一些好诗，但由于他严重的个人主义长期没有得到改造，到了社会主义革命阶段，他就不能为社会主义歌唱了。他只有革面洗心，痛改前非，才能在政治上和创作上有前途。
