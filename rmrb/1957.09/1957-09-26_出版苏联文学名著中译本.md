Publishing Soviet Literary Masterpieces in Translation
The People's Literature Publishing House will publish some Soviet literary masterpieces with high ideological and artistic value. Some of these have been translated and published before, but this time they have been re-edited by the translators with reference to other versions, or even re-translated, and some have been added with illustrations by famous artists. For example:
  "The Rout" (毁灭), originally translated and published by Mr. Lu Xun in 1930, has been added with seven or eight illustrations specially made by the famous Soviet painter Veresky, in addition to retaining the original pen-and-ink illustrations. "The Iron Flood" (铁流) has also been thoroughly revised by the translator, Mr. Cao Jinghua, based on the new version after spending a lot of time. "Chapaev" (恰巴耶夫) (formerly translated as "Xia Boyang" 夏伯阳) was originally translated from the English version and is now re-translated by Comrade Bao Xu based on the original Russian text. "And Quiet Flows the Don" (静静的顿河) has been re-translated by the original translator, Comrade Jin Ren, over two or three years, based on the author's revised new version. "The Road to Calvary" (苦难的历程) was also originally translated from the English version, but the current translator, Comrade Zhu Wen, has re-edited it with reference to two English versions and the Russian text, and the translation has been greatly revised.
    The new edition includes the three-volume "Poem of Pedagogy" (教育诗), the most outstanding work of the Soviet educator and writer Makarenko, which is being translated by Comrade Lei Ran, the translator of "A Real Man" (真正的人). One or two volumes will be published within this year, and the entire set will be completed next year. "Selected Works of Mayakovsky" (马雅柯夫斯基选集) (five volumes) includes short poems in volumes one and two, long poems in volume three, plays in volume four, and prose in volume five. Most of these works are being introduced to our country for the first time, and the first volume will be published within this year. In addition, the novel "People from the Backwoods" (来自穷乡僻壤的人们) and others will also be published. (Shu Fen)

    出版苏联文学名著中译本
    人民文学出版社将出版一些有高度思想性及艺术价值的苏联文学名著。其中有一些曾经翻译出版过，此次都经译者参照其他版本重加校订，甚至重译，有的又增加了著名作家的插图。如
  “毁灭”，原在1930年即由鲁迅先生翻译出版过，这次除保留原有钢笔画插图外，又增加了七八幅苏联著名画家维列斯基专门制作的插图。“铁流”，也经译者曹靖华先生花了很多的时间，根据新版本彻底修改过。“恰巴耶夫”（旧译名“夏伯阳”），原根据英译本转译，现由葆煦同志根据俄文原本重译。“静静的顿河”，原译者金人同志花了两三年的时间，根据作者修改的新版本重新翻译。“苦难的历程”，原来也是从英译本转译的现译者朱雯同志又参照两本英译本及俄文本重新校订，译文有很大的修改。
    新版书有三卷“教育诗”，是苏联教育家、文学家马卡连柯最杰出的作品，正由“真正的人”的译者磊然同志翻译中，年内可出一、二卷，明年出齐。“马雅柯夫斯基选集”（五卷），一、二卷是短诗，三卷是长诗，四卷是剧本，五卷是散文。这些作品绝大部分都是第一次介绍到我国来的，年内先出第一卷。此外还有小说“来自穷乡僻壤的人们”等也将出版。　（树芬）
