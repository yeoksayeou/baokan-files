    The employees of the Ministry of Aquatic Products exposed the rightist Zhao Yue's vicious conspiracy to attack the Party.

    Zhao Yue spread rumors that "the lives of farmers are very hard, and their faces are swollen from eating wild vegetables." He clamored that "it is too cheap for the Communist Party to carry out rectification with gentle breezes and fine rain," and cursed the Party's leading cadres as "new nobles" and "new bureaucrats," and slandered the new Party members who joined the Party after liberation as "opportunists." He openly clamored that the Communist Party should stop developing in the future. In addition, he also brought out his reactionary and utterly anti-communist articles written before liberation for re-promotion. These reactionary words and deeds fully exposed his consistent anti-communist and anti-people ugly nature.

    This rightist was born into a bureaucratic landlord family, graduated from the pseudo-Central Political University, and joined the Kuomintang with the introduction of two Kuomintang Central Committee members, actively engaging in anti-communism. After liberation, he concealed his history and mixed into the Communist Youth League organization. Because many of his reactionary exploiting-class relatives were sentenced to reform through labor or were under surveillance by the government, he became even more dissatisfied with the Party. Old and new hatreds made this rightist expose his anti-communist true colors to the people again.

    赵越反共陷入重围
    本报讯　水产部职工揭露了右派分子赵越向党进攻的恶毒阴谋。
    赵越造谣说“农民生活苦得很，吃野菜把脸都吃肿了”。他叫嚣“用和风细雨的方法来整风太便宜了共产党”，咒骂党员领导干部是“新贵族”、“新官僚”，污蔑解放后入党的新党员是“投机分子”。他公然叫嚣共产党今后应停止发展。另外，他还把解放前夕写的反动透顶的反共文章重新拿来宣扬。这些反动言行充分暴露了他一贯反共反人民的丑恶本质。
    这个右派分子出身官僚地主家庭，曾在伪中央政治大学毕业，并经两个国民党中央委员介绍参加国民党，积极进行反共。解放后，隐瞒历史，混入团的组织。由于他的反动的剥削阶级亲属多被政府判刑劳改或管制，他更加对党不满。新仇旧恨，使这个右派分子在人民面前又暴露了他的反共真面目。
