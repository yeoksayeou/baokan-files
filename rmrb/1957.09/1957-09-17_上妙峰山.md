Ascending Miaofeng Mountain
Comrade Chen Yi, you hired my donkey, and I'll take you up Miaofeng Mountain. It's four stops from here, thirty-two *li*, a long way, and we won't be back until six in the afternoon. Comrade, I'm taking you up Miaofeng Mountain, but the mountain road isn't easy to walk, with gravel all the way, so be careful not to wear out your soles. But once you reach the top, the scenery at the temple is beautiful! Comrade, let's go, I'll take you up Miaofeng Mountain! I've been allocated land, I've joined the cooperative, and I'm old enough to be in the "Five Guarantees" program, but I can't stand being idle. Herding donkeys is my trade, and now I'm doing it as a side job. Comrade, let's go up Miaofeng Mountain together. This mountain has a long history. In April, during the temple fair, the peaches and plums are in full bloom. In September, when climbing to a height, the red leaves cover the mountain. Many of you Beijingers come here, and we donkey herders have work to do. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was great chaos here. The Japanese occupied Beijing, and many traitors emerged among the local landlords. Kuomintang officials, big and small, led their troops to Mount Emei in Sichuan, leaving us common people to fight the resistance. Led by the Communist Party, workers and peasants formed guerrilla units. To love our country and protect our homes, we established an anti-Japanese base area in Miaofeng Mountain. My old man was still young then, around forty, and the guerrillas took me in as an intelligence officer. I delivered letters, guided the way, reported enemy movements, and participated in clearing the fields and strengthening the walls during the counter-sweeps. The Japanese couldn't drive us away, couldn't wipe us out, so they set fire to Miaofeng Mountain. It's a pity that an ancient temple with a thousand years of history turned to ash and smoke. Comrade, we can already see Miaofeng Mountain. Our village cadres often ask me to tell the history of the War of Resistance. I always say that in my opinion, the conclusion of the War of Resistance is: the working class and the Communist Party should lead China! Comrade, we're almost at Miaofeng Mountain. A few days ago, news came from Beijing that the democratic parties are engaging in great debates and free expression. When this wind reached our village, it turned into landlords and rich peasants trying to settle accounts with the peasants, and we won't stand for that! Comrade, we're about to reach Miaofeng Mountain. Speaking of the shortcomings of the village cadres, I also have many complaints. For example, putting on airs and getting emotional, these small things don't matter, but unfair assignments and unfair work point recording are really unjust! All this should be corrected, but how can we let the landlords and rich peasants settle accounts? Wouldn't that change the socialist world! Comrade, my donkey is really strong, and I've brought you to Miaofeng Mountain. Although the village cadres have many shortcomings, they are really capable. Our village only has so many young men, and after much deliberation, we decided to let them do it. We unite with the village cadres to externally oppose settling accounts, and of course, we also raise internal criticisms about their shortcomings. Comrade, we've arrived at Miaofeng Mountain. Look at Fragrant Hills and Emerald Hills, those are mountains. The Tanzhe Temple and Jietai Temple are right in front of us. Looking east, the Shanhaiguan Pass is on the edge of the clouds. Looking back, you can see the Badaling Great Wall and the Great Wall of China. And look at the Yongding River flowing straight towards Dagukou in Tianjin. Comrade, look at the layers of green trees, layers of villages, layers of crops, shielding each other, seemingly endless. Comrade, look at the rows of roads, rows of rivers, the horizontal railways, intersecting as if they will never end. Comrade, look at the red sun overhead, shining brightly on the clear sky of Beijing! Comrade, don't you agree? The Communist Party never separates itself from the people, sharing weal and woe with the common people in the most difficult times of the War of Resistance, and daring to use rectification to train itself. Therefore, it can save China, allowing hundreds of millions of people to stand up. Comrade, look quickly, there are still old guerrilla slogans on the wall: "Support the leadership of the Communist Party in the war of resistance!" "Opposing the Communist Party is surrendering!" "Fight the War of Resistance to the end, all the way to the Yalu River!" Finally, I said to the donkey driver: Comrade, old comrade, thank you for bringing us up Miaofeng Mountain. The scenery of Miaofeng Mountain is truly majestic and beautiful, and the revolutionary stories you told are both correct and vivid! The old aggressors and all reactionaries should recognize this lesson: The sacred self-defense of the Chinese people once used Miaofeng Mountain on the Beijing plain!

　　上妙峰山
　　陈毅同志，你雇我的驴，我送你上妙峰山。这里去有四站，四八三十二里，路很远，要下午六点才能回转。同志，我送你上妙峰山，山道儿并不好走，沿途石子路，当心把脚掌磨穿。但是到了山顶，庙上风景可好看！同志，走吧，我送你上妙峰山！我分了地，我参加了合作社，我年老列入五保户，可是我闲不惯，吆喝驴儿这是我的本行，现在作为副业来干。同志，我们一道上妙峰山，这山的历史可不浅，四月庙会，桃李盛开，九月登高，红叶满山。你们北京人来这儿多，我们跑驴儿的就有活儿干。抗日时期，这儿天下大乱，日本人坐北京，乡下地主中出了许多汉奸，国民党大小官员们带队伍跑上四川的峨嵋山，抗日的事情让我们老百姓来干。由共产党带头，工人农民组成了游击队，为了爱国保家，抗日根据地就扎在妙峰山。我老头儿那时候还年青，四十上下，游击队收我作一个情报员，我送信、带路、报告敌情，反扫荡时参加清野又把壁坚。日本人赶我们不走，消灭我们不了，就放火烧了妙峰山。可惜一座上千年的古庙，化为灰，化为烟。同志，我们已经可以看到妙峰山，我们村上干部经常要我说抗日历史，我就说，依我看抗日战争的结论是：中国的事工人阶级和共产党应该领先！同志，我们快到妙峰山，前几天北京传来消息，听说民主党派正在大鸣大放，这股风到我们村上，就变成地主富农向农民倒算，这我们可不干！同志，我们将要到妙峰山，说村干部的缺点，我也有许多不满，比如耍态度、闹情绪，这些小事，都可不管，但派差事、记工分有些不公道，这才真冤！这一切都应该纠正，但怎能让地富倒算，那不就变了社会主义的天！同志，我的驴儿真硬健，我已送你到了妙峰山。村干部缺点虽然多，可人家办事真能干，我们村上只有这多小伙子，选来选去还是让他们干，我们同村干部联合对外反倒算，对内部的缺点当然也要提意见。同志，我们到了妙峰山，你看香山翠微那算山，潭拓戒坛在眼前。往东看山海关在云边，往后看八达岭、万里长城看得见。你再看永定河的奔流，直向天津的大沽滩。同志，你瞧，层层绿树，层层村坊，层层庄稼，互相掩护望不着边。同志，你瞧，条条道路，条条河流，横亘的铁道，交叉着似乎永远不会断。同志，你瞧，红日当头，正照耀着北京城明朗的天！同志，你说对不对？共产党从来都不脱离人民，在最艰难的抗日时期与老百姓共患难，而且敢用整风来锻炼自己。所以它能拯救中国，使几万万人民把身翻。同志，你快看，那墙上还有游击队老标语，“拥护共产党领导抗战！”“反共就是投降！”“抗战到底，打到鸭绿江边！”我最后向驴夫说：同志，老同志，感谢你带我们上妙峰山，妙峰山的风景真雄伟，真好看，你说的革命故事既正确也鲜妍！侵略老和一切反动派应该认识这样的教训：中国人民的神圣自卫，曾经在北京大平原上利用过妙峰山！
