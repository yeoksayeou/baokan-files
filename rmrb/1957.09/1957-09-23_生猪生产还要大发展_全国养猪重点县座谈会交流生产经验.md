Xinhua News Agency Report: A national symposium of key hog-raising counties concluded on the 18th. This meeting was jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Urban Services on September 9th in Beijing. At the meeting, experiences in developing hog production from various regions were fully exchanged.

During the meeting, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premier Deng Zihui, and Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai all attended and spoke, instructing everyone to further improve hog production in the Second Five-Year Plan.

The meeting unanimously agreed that, based on the hog production situation in key counties and key agricultural cooperatives, large-scale hog raising is not only an effective way to solve the source of fertilizer and increase grain production, but also an important way to increase the income of cooperative members and improve their lives. In Daxinzhai Village, Pinggu County, Hebei Province, grain yield per unit area increased by 96% due to raising more pigs, and a grain-deficient village became a grain-surplus village. Xianren Village Agricultural Cooperative in Neiqiu County had a hog-raising income of 53,120 yuan in 1956. As cooperative members' incomes increased, agricultural production cooperatives became more consolidated.

According to figures provided at the symposium, by the end of August, the number of hogs raised nationwide had reached more than 11.8 million, an increase of more than 4 million compared to the hog-raising figures nationwide at the end of June reported by the Ministry of Agriculture, and an increase of 16.34 million compared to 1954, when the number of hogs raised in China was the highest in history. Looking at the hog production situation in the twenty-three key counties and thirty-six key cooperatives with relatively high hog production that attended the meeting, the thirteen key counties in the south have reached an average of 0.46 hogs per person, 2 hogs per household, and 1 hog per four mu of cultivated land. The twenty key cooperatives have reached an average of 0.73 hogs per person, 3.23 hogs per household, and 1 hog per 2.46 mu of cultivated land. The ten key counties in the north have reached an average of 0.34 hogs per person, 1.62 hogs per household, and 1 hog per 10.49 mu of cultivated land; the sixteen key cooperatives have reached an average of 0.76 hogs per person, 3.71 hogs per household, and 1 hog per 4.04 mu of cultivated land. However, at present, the thirteen southern provinces and cities average only 1.1 hogs per household and 1 hog per eight mu of cultivated land, while the thirteen northern provinces and cities (excluding Xinjiang) average only 0.71 hogs per household and 1 hog per twenty-nine mu of cultivated land. This shows that China's hog production still has great potential for development and must continue to be vigorously developed in the future.

The meeting called for the continued implementation throughout the country of the principle of "private ownership, private raising, public assistance" as instructed in the "Decision on Developing Hog Production" issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in February this year. This principle is the main key to supporting the development of the hog-raising industry.

The meeting believes that in the current situation where the growth rate of grain production in China is not keeping up with the growth of consumption, it is appropriate to fully utilize the excellent characteristics of Chinese hogs that can eat green and coarse feed, and adopt the policy of "mainly green and coarse feed, supplemented by appropriate concentrated feed" for raising hogs. In addition to fully utilizing agricultural by-products such as straw, stalks, vines, and creepers for raising hogs, agricultural production cooperatives should further explore sources of green and coarse feed and take extensive measures to utilize wild and aquatic plants to feed hogs. In the future, agricultural products should be processed locally as much as possible to increase the concentrated feed for raising hogs; the unreasonable situation in the past where agricultural products were concentrated in towns for processing and then the by-products were transported back to the countryside should be changed.

Regarding the prevention and treatment of hog diseases and the improvement of hog breeds, the meeting called on all regions to mobilize and rely on agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in the feeding and management of hogs, as well as cleaning and disinfection, actively carry out preventive inoculations, and implement the principle of "prevention over treatment." It requested that hog cholera be basically eliminated during the Second Five-Year Plan, and that the prevalence of swine erysipelas and swine fever be controlled. Regions producing breeding pigs should be designated by the provincial agricultural authorities as high-quality pig production bases to vigorously breed and improve, and systematically promote them.

The meeting believes that the policy put forward by the Ministry of Urban Services to promote and support the production of non-staple foods such as pigs, cattle, and sheep has played a great supporting role in the development of hog production and other non-staple foods nationwide. In the future, procurement efforts should be vigorously strengthened, with particular attention to strengthening procurement in mountainous areas and areas with inconvenient transportation, and comprehensively promoting the all-round development of non-staple food production in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner.

The meeting emphasized that the hog-raising experience of the key counties is extremely rich, and all regions should learn from each other. At the same time, leaders at all levels must continue to strengthen organizational leadership in hog production, establish bases, cultivate typical examples, and further promote the development of hog production.

### 生猪生产还要大发展  全国养猪重点县座谈会交流生产经验

    生猪生产还要大发展
    全国养猪重点县座谈会交流生产经验
    新华社讯　全国养猪重点县座谈会18日结束。这个会议是农业部和城市服务部9月9日在北京联合召开的。会议上充分交流了各地发展生猪生产的经验。
    会议期间，朱德副主席、邓子恢副总理和内务部谢觉哉部长都先后到会讲了话，指示大家在第二个五年计划中进一步作好发展生猪生产工作。
    会议一致认为，从重点县和重点社的养猪生产情况来看，大量养猪不仅是解决肥料来源、增产粮食的有效办法；同时也是增加社员收入、改善社员生活的重要途径。河北省平谷县大辛寨村，由于养猪多，粮食单位面积产量提高了96％，缺粮村变成了余粮村；内丘县仙人村建设农业社，1956年养猪收入达到五万三千一百二十元。由于社员收入增加，农业生产合作社更加巩固了。
    根据座谈会提供的数字，到8月底全国养猪已达一万一千八百多万头，比6月底农业部统计全国养猪数又增加了四百多万头，比我国历史上养猪最多的1954年增加了一千六百三十四万头。从到会的养猪较多的二十三个重点县和三十六个重点社的养猪生产情况看，南方十三个重点县已达到平均每人养猪零点四六头，每户养猪二头，每四亩耕地养猪一头，二十个重点社已达到平均每人养猪零点七三头，每户养猪三点二三头，每二点四六亩耕地养猪一头。北方的十个重点县已达到平均每人养猪零点三四头，每户养猪一点六二头，每一零点四九亩耕地养猪一头；十六个重点社已达到平均每人养猪零点七六头，每户养猪三点七一头，每四点零四亩耕地养猪一头。但目前南方十三个省、市平均每户只养猪一点一头，每八亩耕地才养猪一头，而北方的十三个省市（不包括新疆）则平均每户只养猪零点七一头，每二十九亩耕地才养猪一头。这说明我国养猪生产还有很大的发展潜力，今后必须继续大力发展。
    会议要求在全国范围内，继续贯彻执行今年2月间中共中央和国务院“关于发展养猪生产的决定”中指示的“私有、私养、公助”的方针，这个方针是扶助养猪业发展的主要关键。
    会议认为，在当前我国粮食生产的增长速度，还赶不上消费增长的情况下，充分利用我国生猪能够食用青绿粗饲料的优良特点，采取“以青绿粗饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料”养猪的方针是适当的。农业生产合作社除应充分利用农作物副产品秸、秆、藤、蔓等养猪外，还要进一步挖掘青粗饲料来源，大量采取利用野生、水生植物喂猪。今后农产品应该尽可能就地加工，增加养猪的精饲料；过去农产品集中在城镇加工而后再将副产品运往农村的不合理状态应加以改变。
    关于防治猪病和改良猪种问题，会议要求各地发动和依靠农业社做好生猪的饲养管理，以及清洁消毒等工作，积极开展预防注射，贯彻“防重于治”的方针，要求在第二个五年计划期间，基本上消灭猪瘟，并控制猪丹毒、猪肺疫的流行。生产种猪的地区，应该由省农业主管部门划定为良种猪生产基地，大力繁殖提高，有计划地加以推广。
    会议认为城市服务部提出的促进和扶植猪、牛、羊等副食品生产的方针，对全国生猪生产和其他副食品的发展起了很大的扶植作用，今后应该大力加强收购工作，特别要注意加强山区和交通不便的地区的收购工作，有计划有重点有步骤地促进副食品生产的全面发展。
    会议着重指出：各重点县的养猪经验是极为丰富的，各地应该互相学习，同时，各级领导还需不断加强对生猪生产的组织领导工作，建立基地，培养典型，进一步推动生猪生产的发展。
