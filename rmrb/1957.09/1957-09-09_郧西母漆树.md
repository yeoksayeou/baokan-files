    Yunxi Mother Lacquer Tree
    "Mother Lacquer" trees are abundant in the mountainous areas of Yunxi County, Hubei Province. This type of tree can produce both varnish and lacquer oil. The lacquer it produces is of better quality than that of the "father lacquer" tree. It is thick, has heavy oil content, is hard, and easily absorbs moisture. Furniture lacquered with it is sturdy, smooth, and shiny. Lacquer oil can be used to make candles and soap. The picture shows farmers tapping lacquer. (Photo by Guang Yang, Hubei Daily)

    郧西母漆树
    湖北省郧西县山区盛产“母漆”树，这种树既能产清漆，又能产漆油。它产的漆比“公漆”树的漆质量好，漆稠和、油水重、性硬、易收潮，漆出来的家具入木结实、光滑发亮。漆油可做腊烛和肥皂。这是农民们正在割漆。光羊摄（湖北日报社稿）（附图片）
