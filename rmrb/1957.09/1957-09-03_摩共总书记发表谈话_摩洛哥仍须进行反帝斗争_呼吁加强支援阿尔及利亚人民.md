    According to Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, September 2nd: The Belgian Communist Party's "Red Flag" reported in late August that the General Secretary of the Moroccan Communist Party, Ali Yata, who was forced into exile, recently spoke to a reporter from this newspaper when passing through Brussels. He said that French, Spanish, and American troops are still stationed in Morocco. This has led to unacceptable interference in Morocco's internal affairs, preventing it from pursuing a completely independent policy. Nine-tenths of Morocco's economy is still in the hands of French capital, and it is not yet economically independent. In addition, Morocco's borders have never been determined. Territories such as Mauritania, Ceuta, Melilla, and Ifni are still under French or Spanish rule.

    Ali Yata said that the Moroccan Communist Party believes that the fundamental task of the entire national movement in Morocco is to continue the anti-imperialist struggle in order to lay, complete, and consolidate Morocco's independence. This includes the withdrawal of foreign troops, the recognition of its borders, and the liberation of Morocco's economy.

    When talking about the Algerian question, he pointed out that the war waged by French imperialism to suppress the Algerian people's desire for independence is supported by the entire Atlantic Alliance. The helicopters used in Algeria are supplied by the United States. Without the consent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France would not be able to send 600,000 troops to Algeria.

    He believes that France's continued rule over Algeria also constitutes a serious threat to Morocco's independence. He said that the Moroccan people are deeply pained by the massacre that the fraternal Algerian people are suffering in a truly devastating war. They are increasingly expressing their solidarity with the heroic Algerian people.

    He said that the international workers' movement also has a responsibility to strengthen its support for the Algerian people.

    摩共总书记发表谈话
    摩洛哥仍须进行反帝斗争
    呼吁加强支援阿尔及利亚人民
    据新华社2日讯  布鲁塞尔消息：比共“红旗报”8月下旬报道，被迫流亡国外的摩洛哥共产党总书记阿里·亚塔最近在路过布鲁塞尔时对这家报纸记者谈到摩洛哥目前的形势说，摩洛哥境内仍然驻有法国、西班牙和美国的军队。这样就使摩洛哥的内政不断受到不能容忍的干涉，使得它不能奉行完全独立的政策。摩洛哥经济的十分之九仍然在法国资本掌握之中。它在经济上还没有独立。此外，摩洛哥的边界始终还没有确定。毛里塔尼亚、休达城和美雅城、伊夫尼等处领土还始终处在法国或西班牙的统治之下。
    阿里·亚塔说，摩洛哥共产党认为：摩洛哥整个民族运动的根本任务是继续反帝国主义斗争，以求奠定、完成和巩固摩洛哥的独立。这包含着撤出外国军队、承认它的边界和解放摩洛哥的经济。
    在谈到阿尔及利亚问题时，他指出，法国帝国主义为镇压阿尔及利亚人民的独立愿望而进行的战争得到整个大西洋联盟的支持。在阿尔及利亚使用的直升飞机是由美国供给的。要是没有得到北大西洋公约组织的同意，法国是不可能派出六十万军队到阿尔及利亚去的。
    他认为，法国继续统治阿尔及利亚，也构成对摩洛哥独立的严重威胁。他说，阿尔及利亚兄弟人民正在经受着真正毁灭性战争的屠杀，摩洛哥人民对此深深感到痛苦。他们对英勇的阿尔及利亚人民日益强烈地表示声援。
    他说，国际工人运动也有责任加强对阿尔及利亚人民的支援。
