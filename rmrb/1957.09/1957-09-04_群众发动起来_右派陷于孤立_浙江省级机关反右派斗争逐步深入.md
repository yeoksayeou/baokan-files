　　The anti-Rightist struggle, with tremendous momentum, has been launched by a fighting force of more than 11,000 staff members in Zhejiang's provincial organs. Currently, 51 units have exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of Rightists within their organs; the masses in these units have been mobilized, a backbone force has been formed, and Rightists are increasingly isolated. The struggle is deepening step by step. In the news and publishing units, the Provincial Forestry Department, the Commerce Department, the Handicraft Industry Administration, and the Provincial Insurance Company, where progress has been faster, Rightists are beginning to bow their heads and admit their guilt in the face of facts and truth.

　　In their struggle against the Rightists, the organ staff members have adhered to the method of reasoning. They have presented facts and reasoned with the Rightists, which not only powerfully refuted the Rightists' reactionary remarks but also educated themselves. For example, when Rightists Li Shihao and Fan Yaofeng of the Provincial Forestry Department said that "forestry work is a complete mess" and "the Communist Party does not value forestry," Wu Jinrong, a senior engineer of the department, made a convincing comparison between the situations before and after liberation to illustrate the enormous achievements of forestry work. Many units have also summarized the Rightists' remarks into several fundamental issues, formed special groups to analyze them, and refuted them by presenting facts and reasoning.

　　From the materials that have been exposed, members of democratic parties account for a considerable proportion of the Rightists in the organs. They colluded with Rightists within the Party, working in concert from inside and outside to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. For example, Ye Huishi, deputy manager of the Provincial Insurance Company and chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK) branch, actively implemented the RCCK Provincial Committee's Rightist clique's policy of recruiting soldiers and buying horses, not only actively expanding the organization within the company, proposing to complete a two-year plan in six months, but also planning to develop the organization and establish strongholds throughout the province's insurance company system. When the rectification campaign began, the RCCK branch, headed by Ye Huishi, carried out large-scale activities. Ye told RCCK members: Do not raise minor lifestyle issues, raise major issues. The RCCK branch also privately held forums, collected materials, incited the masses, and launched a frenzied attack on the Party. After Wu Weiping's seven reactionary programs were published, Ye immediately publicized them among the masses and instructed RCCK members to study them.

　　Among the Rightists in the organs, there are also some renegade Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, many of whom have developed political degeneration due to serious bourgeois individualism and corruption. For example, Huang Xiaoping, a Communist Party member and section chief of the Provincial Planning Commission, developed to the point of attacking the Party and attacking socialism because of his long-term complaints about his position and treatment, and dissatisfaction with the Party.

　　The materials that have been exposed prove that many Rightists in the organs have long obstructed the implementation of the Party's instructions and resolutions. For example, Wang Fawu and Ye Shuzi, Rightists in the Provincial Commerce Department, stubbornly refused to implement the Provincial Party Committee's decision on the issue of live pig allocation in March of this year and fabricated materials to viciously attack the Provincial Party Committee. On the news and art and literature fronts, the Party's policies and guidelines have often not been well implemented due to the obstruction of the Rightists.

### 群众发动起来　右派陷于孤立  浙江省级机关反右派斗争逐步深入

    群众发动起来　右派陷于孤立
    浙江省级机关反右派斗争逐步深入
    本报杭州2日电　浙江省级机关有一万一千多名工作人员组成的战斗队伍已经开展了声势浩大的反右派斗争。现在有五十一个单位对机关内部右派分子的反动言行进行了揭发、批判；这些单位的群众已经发动起来，骨干力量已经形成，右派分子日益陷于孤立，斗争正在逐步深入地发展。进展较快的新闻、出版单位和省林业厅、商业厅、手工业管理局、省保险公司等，右派分子在事实和真理面前理屈词穷，开始低头认罪。
    机关工作人员在同右派分子的斗争中，坚持了说理的方法。他们向右派分子摆事实、讲道理，不仅有力地驳斥了右派分子的反动言论，而且也教育了自己。如省林业厅右派分子李士豪、范尧蜂说“林业工作一团糟”、“共产党不重视林业”，该厅老工程师吴锦荣就拿解放前后的情况加以对比，令人信服地说明了林业工作的巨大成绩。许多单位还把右派分子的言论归纳成为几个根本问题，组成专门小组进行分析，摆事实、讲道理加以驳斥。
    从已经揭露的材料来看，机关右派分子当中，民主党派成员占了相当大的数量，他们同党内右派分子互相勾结，里应外合地向党、向社会主义猖狂进攻。如省保险公司副经理、民革支部主任委员叶蕙石，积极执行民革省委右派集团招兵买马的方针，不仅在该公司内积极扩展组织，提出两年计划半年完成，而且策划在全省保险公司系统内发展组织，建立据点。整风开始时，以叶蕙石为首的民革支部大肆活动，叶对民革成员说：不要提生活小节问题，要提大问题。民革支部还私自召开座谈会，搜集材料，煽动群众，向党猖狂进攻。当吴惟平的七条反动纲领公布后，叶即在群众中大肆宣扬，并且布置民革成员学习。
    在机关右派分子中，也有一些变节的共产党员和共青团员，他们中有不少人是由于严重的资产阶级个人主义、腐化堕落而发展到政治上蜕化变质的。如省计委党员科长黄小萍，就由于长期以来闹地位、闹待遇，对党不满，发展到攻击党、攻击社会主义。
    从已经揭露的材料证明，机关中不少右派分子长期以来阻挠着党的指示、决议的贯彻执行。如省商业厅右派分子王法武、叶树滋，今年3月在生猪调拨问题上，横蛮地拒绝执行省委决定，并且捏造材料对省委进行恶毒攻击。在新闻、文艺战线上，也由于右派分子的阻挡，使党的方针、政策常常不能很好的贯彻。
