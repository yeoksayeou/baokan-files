　　Learn from the Tirana Football Team
　　Yang Xiuwu
    The Albanian football team is one of the strongest in Europe, having drawn 0-0 with the powerful Hungarian national team in Tirana. The Tirana football team, which is visiting our country this time, has not only its original athletes but also many rising stars, with an average age of less than twenty-five. The Albanian football team has a wealth of match experience that is worth learning from.
    One of the biggest advantages of the Tirana football team is that its players have plenty of stamina. In yesterday's match against the "Lianyi" team, when the score was 2-2 in the second half, the "Lianyi" team already appeared to be running out of steam, but the Tirana team became more and more courageous, repeatedly approaching the "Lianyi" team's goal, posing a great threat to the "Lianyi" team. We observed the Tirana football team's practice after arriving in Beijing. Under the supervision of the coaches, the players carefully performed every action such as gymnastics, sprinting, jumping, and turning, before carrying out other technical exercises in an orderly manner. In the past few international competitions, our football team has exposed the weakness of insufficient stamina. We should correct the view that one-sidedly emphasizes technical training and neglects physical training.
    The Albanian footballers showed a brave, tenacious, and proactive competitive style on the field. From the beginning to the end of the match, whether losing or leading, the players' activity did not slacken. During the match, not only did the defenders fight for every ball, but the forwards also proactively assisted in defense, trying their best to intercept the ball controlled by the opponent's backs, forcing the opponent to pass the ball slowly and inaccurately, reducing the opponent's attacking speed and power, which is not common in general football teams.
    In terms of defensive methods, the Tirana football team, in addition to the center-back protecting the area in front of the goal using zonal marking, the other midfielders and backs all used man-to-man marking, closely guarding the opponent's forwards.
    From the Tirana football team's matches, we can learn a concise, simple, and practical style of play: when unnecessary, the players rarely make feints and redundant dribbling, but instead focus on collective cooperation. Because too many feints and dribbling not only consume physical strength but also affect the team's close cooperation and weaken the attacking power. When they pass the ball, they often pass it out in one go without stopping.
    Through the Albanian football team's visit and matches, the Chinese and Albanian football players not only learned from each other and exchanged football skills and experience, but more importantly, strengthened and consolidated the understanding and friendship between the athletes of the two countries. We wish our friends – Albanian football – greater progress.

　　向地拉那足球队学习
　　杨秀武
    阿尔巴尼亚足球队是欧洲足球劲旅之一，曾经在地拉那与实力雄厚的匈牙利国家队以零比零的成绩踢成和局。此次来我国访问的地拉那足球队除了拥有原来的运动健将之外，又增添了许多后起之秀，全队的平均年龄还不到二十五岁。阿尔巴尼亚足球队有着丰富的比赛经验值得我们学习。
    地拉那足球队最大的优点之一是队员们有着充沛的体力，在昨日对“联一”队比赛中，到下半时打成二比二的时候，“联一”队已显得体力不支，可是地拉那队越踢越勇，几度逼近“联一”队的门前，使“联一”队遭到很大的威胁。我们参观了地拉那足球队来京后的练习，在教练员的监督下，球员认真地作着每一个体操、冲跑、跳跃、转身等动作，之后才井然有序地作其他技术练习。我国足球队在过去数次国际比赛中已经暴露了体力不足的弱点。我们应该端正那种片面地强调技术训练不重视体力训练的看法。
    阿尔巴尼亚的足球健儿们在球场上表现了勇敢顽强、积极主动的竞赛作风。从比赛开始到终结，不论在失利或领先的时候，球员的活动毫不松懈。比赛中，不仅防守队员见球必争，前锋也主动的协助防守，尽力抢截对方后卫控制的球，迫使对方出球缓慢，不准确，降低了对方的进攻速度和力量，这在一般足球队是不常见的。
    在防守方法上，地拉那足球队除保护球门前区域的中卫采用区域防守外，其他前卫、后卫都用人盯人紧紧看守着对方的前锋。
    从地拉那足球队的比赛中，我们可以学习到简练、朴素、实用的比赛作风：不必要的时候，球员们很少作假动作和多余的盘带，而是致力于集体的配合。因为过多的假动作和带球不仅消耗体力，而且影响全队的密切配合，削弱了进攻的力量。他们传球时常常不加停顿，而是一脚把球传出。
    通过阿尔巴尼亚足球队的访问比赛，中、阿两国足球运动员不仅互相学习、交流了足球技术和经验，更重要的是加强和巩固了两国运动员之间的了解和友谊。祝我们的朋友——阿尔巴尼亚的足球运动获得更大的进步。
