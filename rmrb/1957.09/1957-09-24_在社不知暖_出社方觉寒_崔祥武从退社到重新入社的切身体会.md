Not Feeling the Warmth in the Collective, Only Realizing the Cold Outside
--Cui Xiangwu’s Personal Experience of Leaving and Rejoining the Collective
	Jie Yuhui
	“Not feeling the warmth at home, only realizing the cold when you go out.” The story of Cui Xiangwu, a member of the "May First" Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyang County, leaving and then rejoining the collective, illustrates this principle.
	In March of this year, Cui Xiangwu, a member of the "May First" Fourth Cooperative, made trouble and demanded to withdraw from the agricultural cooperative to work independently. Why did he want to leave the collective? The main reason was that he saw individual farmers outside the collective who had not paid their agricultural tax, had not sold their grain quotas, and whose production was not controlled by anyone, living carefree lives. From then on, Cui Xiangwu looked for all kinds of excuses and repeatedly demanded to withdraw from the collective. In addition, some upper-middle peasants secretly supported him, which strengthened his desire to withdraw. The cooperative and township cadres repeatedly tried to persuade him, but he would not listen. In mid-March, the members' representative meeting allowed Cui Xiangwu to withdraw from the cooperative.
	After leaving the collective, Cui Xiangwu envisioned a perfect plan to get rich: he could accumulate three or four *shi* of grain a year, store four or five hundred *jin* of cotton in two years, and build a large house in three years. At first, he was happy and worked hard from dawn till dusk.
	Cui Xiangwu’s beautiful plan did not go as smoothly as he had hoped. After a long drought, a heavy rain suddenly fell in April, and the collective quickly sowed its cotton. But what about him? He could only worry, leading his children to pull the plow and plant cotton. After two days, he had only planted four *mu*, leaving him exhausted and sweaty. Finally, he had no choice but to ask the collective to plant the remaining six *mu* of cotton for him. Not long after, Cui Xiangwu begged relatives and neighbors to scrape together more than seventy yuan to buy an old ox to prepare for the summer harvest. However, the old ox was too weak to pull the wheat. He had just asked the collective for help when a torrential rain struck. Cui Xiangwu wailed to the heavens and gave up threshing the grain.
	After Cui Xiangwu left the collective, he encountered many difficulties. His second son came back from elementary school and demanded to join the collective, refusing to work; his wife complained all day long, even reluctant to cook for him. Cui Xiangwu couldn't sleep, calculating the income and expenses after the summer harvest. After calculating, he found that he had nothing left and even owed fifty-seven yuan, which shocked him. He suddenly realized that if he had been in the collective, his labor days would have earned him four hundred *jin* of grain and more than twenty yuan.
	In fact, the benefits of collectivization were obvious, but it seemed that Cui Xiangwu had only just discovered them. He realized at this point that leaving the collective was not worthwhile. He said to the branch secretary, Cui Yicai: "I have tasted enough of the sweetness and bitterness, I want to return to the collective!" But he wondered if the collective would still accept him, and whether the members would discriminate against him after he returned. A series of questions weakened his courage to return. In the end, after struggling again and again, he strengthened his resolve and applied to rejoin the collective.
	After Cui Xiangwu returned to the collective, he saw that no one discriminated against him, and they assigned him to a work group that suited him. His wife was also kinder to him, and his two sons also participated in the collective’s labor. Cui Xiangwu said, "The socialist family is good, you couldn't beat me out of it."

    在社不知暖　出社方觉寒
    ——崔祥武从退社到重新入社的切身体会
    解玉慧
      “在家不觉暖，出门方知寒。”咸阳县“五一”第四农业社社员崔祥武退社又回社的故事，说明了这个道理。
    今年3月间，“五一”四社社员崔祥武无理取闹，要求退出农业社单干。他为什么要求退社呢？主要原因是他看到公粮没交清、统购粮没卖完、生产不受人指挥的一户单干农民，在社外逍遥自在。从此，崔祥武寻找各种借口，多次要求退社，加上一些上中农暗地里支持，更加强了他退社的要求。社、乡干部多次劝解，他还是不听，3月中旬，通过社员代表会，让崔祥武退社了。
    崔祥武出社以后，想了一个美满的发家计划：一年可以积攒三、四石粮食，两年可储存四、五百斤棉花，三年即可把大房盖起。开始他心里高兴，起早贪黑的干活。
    崔祥武的美满计划，并不是那样如意的。久旱的4月，忽然落了一场饱雨，社里的棉花很快就播种上了。而他呢？只得干着急，带头领娃娃拉犁种棉花，种了两天只种了四亩，弄得他力尽汗干；最后无奈何请社把剩下的六亩棉花给他种了。不久以后，崔祥武央亲托邻凑合了七十多元，买了一条老牛，迎接夏收。可是，老牛力衰拉不动麦，刚去请社帮助，不料倾盆大雨袭来。崔祥武哀天怨地，赌气场也不碾了。
    崔祥武退社以后，遇到过许多难场。二儿子由完小回来，要求入社，躺着不做活；老婆一天嚷鸡骂狗，连饭都不情愿给他做。崔祥武睡不着觉，盘算着夏收后的收支账，算来算去，收支算下来一颗不见，还欠五十七元，不由得吃了一惊。他猛省着：如果在社，自己做的劳动日还能分到四百斤粮食和二十多元。
    事实上合作化的好处明摆着，可对崔祥武说来，好像才发现似的。他这时才知道出社不合算了。他对支书崔义才说：“这个味道是甜是苦我算尝够了，我要回社！”回社，人家不知还要不要，回去后社员会不会歧视自己？一连串的问题削弱了他回社的勇气。最后，斗争来斗争去，还是坚强起来，申请回社。
    崔祥武回社后，他看到大家没有歧视他，分配他到合乎他心意的组里干活。女人也对他好了，两个儿子也参加社的劳动了。崔祥武说：“社会主义的大家庭好，把我打也打不出去了。”
