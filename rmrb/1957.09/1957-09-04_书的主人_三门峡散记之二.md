    The Owner of the Book
    -- Ramblings in Sanmenxia, Part Two
    Lei Jia

    One day, I went with the secretary to listen to a briefing. The car was traveling on the new highway towards the new city.

    I can’t imagine how the residents here lived before this highway existed. Not to mention, how could the Sanmenxia project have even begun without this highway? The highway is built above the future reservoir's elevation, crawling along the spine of the Loess Plateau, with continuous steep curves and countless warning signs. However, the road surface is very well-maintained, designed according to first-class highway standards. If the small trees along the road grow up, and the reservoir is completed, a picturesque scene will appear on the screen. Now, the car license plates are mixed and numerous, even jeeps are hauling furniture, or trucks are carrying people; then, it will be luxurious tour buses or new-style sedans, speeding along.

    A truck full of people was coming towards us, carrying staff from the engineering bureau to the construction site. The two drivers nodded to each other as usual, and we and the people in the truck also glanced at each other as we passed, silently greeting each other.

    Not long after the truck passed, our car suddenly stopped. It turned out that a book had been found in the middle of the highway.

    It was a copy of "Dedication to the Party."

    Who is the owner of this book? It must belong to one of the young people on the truck that just passed. But which young person? Did he lose it because he was carrying too much calculation material? Or did he notice it at the time, but had to bear the heartache of watching it fall on the highway because he couldn't stop the truck?

    Opening the book, apart from a small, unclear note, nothing else was found. At least it was someone who loved books, even unwilling to write a name on it.

    The secretary closed the book and said with a bewildered expression, "How can we find him?"

    I said, "Maybe we'll find him!"

    Thus, I kept an eye out for the owner of this book every day.

    However, this is a very difficult task. I can't help but think of the past. In the winter of 1945, when I was working in a factory in the Northeast, most of the workers there were older workers over thirty. They not only restored the factory to production, but also repaired it with their own hands after the Kuomintang sabotaged it. Their skills came from experience, what they lacked was education. I remember how I taught them to sing their first song – "The East is Red." I remember when we started cultural learning, a pencil in the hands of the old workers seemed heavier than a crowbar. They picked up the pencil, their eyes heavy and apprehensive; but when they wrote the five characters "Chinese Communist Party," they smiled like children.

    If I were asked to find out who among them had suffered the most, it might be difficult; however, if someone had a book of some kind, I could tell you right away. But now it's not so easy. There are so many educated young people, and almost every young person has read "Dedication to the Party."

    I once asked several people, "Do you have 'Dedication to the Party'?" They replied, "I have one; but I sent it to my sister." "I also have one, someone borrowed it." Or, "Mine, isn't it still under my pillow?" The owner of this book is still nowhere to be found.

    After the "Ural" three-cubic-meter electric shovels were put into production, a wave of learning began. Junior high school classes, high school classes, and secondary vocational school classes have all begun enrolling students.

    A female comrade from the education section set up a bench in front of the electric shovel team's entrance. Behind her, a white paper read "Workers' Night School Enrollment," and a group of young people immediately gathered around her. One person squeezing in front said, "Am I the first one?"

    "No, your captain signed up a long time ago!" the female comrade replied.

    "Then sign me up!"

    The dialogue began. Asked his age, he replied nineteen. Asked which class he was entering, he replied elementary school class. But he had already completed elementary school. He didn't want to start learning algebra from scratch again, so to review, he'll start from the second volume! The second person entered junior high school class. When asked if he had any books, he answered somewhat angrily, "I carry all the books I've studied with me, is it even necessary to ask?" The third person was the same, entering junior high school class... Standing behind them, I felt their eagerness to learn, just like the scorching engines they felt in the driver's room of the three-cubic-meter electric shovel.

    The dialogue became increasingly noisy because several people were vying to register. Although they knew that everyone had the opportunity to register; however, they felt that their own desire to learn could not lag behind others.

    The three-cubic-meter electric shovels have been in production for almost two months, and the shovels are still being operated by people temporarily transferred from brother factories and mines. They are grateful for this support; however, they cannot forgive themselves for not mastering the technology before the contract expires. They are third-grade workers, and the driver of the three-cubic-meter electric shovel requires sixth-grade technology. They boldly think: in this era of rapid progress, can they be intimidated by time? Why can't they skip over time and catch up?

    One day, the young statistician of the electric shovel team said to me: he lost his parents when he was young, and his wandering life made him love philosophy and literature; but he said he loved technology and work even more. That Saturday afternoon I met him, and I asked, "Why aren't you sleeping?" He rubbed his eyes and said to me, "No, I have an exam tomorrow morning!" The next day at noon, I was taking a nap, and he came to knock on my door. He whispered, "I passed the exam, lend me that copy of 'People's Literature'..." After he left, I imagined that he must have done very well on the exam, his heart had just been encouraged by numbers, and now it was trembling for this thick magazine...

    Once again, I met the secretary, who suddenly asked me: Has the owner of that book been found?

    I was stunned for a moment; but I said: I have found him. It is those people who have signed up for the workers' night school. They feel that their technology is not as good as that of the Soviet drivers, nor as good as that of the drivers of brother factories and mines, and it seems that this is a temporary difficulty that cannot be overcome; but these young workers who dedicate everything to the Party, having signed up for the workers' night school today, is equivalent to swearing an oath to the Party, and tomorrow they will be excellent drivers of the three-cubic-meter electric shovel, advanced workers marching towards the rocks. I remembered the young statistician, and thought to myself: everywhere are people who dedicate everything to the Party, and the authors who will record these heroic deeds will also appear at the same time.

    书的主人
    ——三门峡散记之二
    雷加
    有一天，我同书记同志一起去听传达报告。汽车在新公路上行驶，向新城走去。
    我不能想像没有这条公路之前，这里的居民如何生活的？更不要说要是没有这条公路，三门峡的工程如何能够开始了。公路修筑在将来水库的标高之上，它顺着黄土高原的脊背爬行，有连续的陡弯和数不清的危险信号牌。但是路面十分讲究，这是按照一级公路标准设计的。如果沿路的小树长大了，水库修成之后，在银幕上就会出现一个如画的镜头。现在，汽车牌号又杂又多，甚至吉普车在拉家具，或者用载重汽车拉人；那时，将是华丽的游览车或是新型的轿子车，在风驰电掣地兜风了。
    迎面正好开来了一辆拉人的载重车，上面坐着由工程局到工地去的工作人员。两个司机照例互相点头，我们和载重车上的人，在并车的时候也互相张望一眼，默默地致意。
    载重车刚走过不久，我们的车也陡然停住了。原来在公路中央，发现了一册书。
    这是一册“把一切献给党”。
    这本书的主人是谁呢？不用说是刚才走过那辆载重车上年青人的。又是哪个年青人呢？他携带的计算材料过多才失落了它呢？还是他当时就发现了，因为不能停车，忍着心痛望着它跌在公路上呢？
    翻开那本书，除了一张含义不清的小纸条之外，别无发现。至少这是一个爱书的人，甚至连个名字也不肯写在上面。
    书记同志合上了那本书，神色迷惘地说：“怎么能够找他呢？”
    我说：“也许会找到的！”
    这样，我天天在留心找这本书的主人。
    然而这是一个非常困难的任务。我不禁想起了过去的年代。1945年冬天，当我在东北的一个工厂工作时，那里的工人多半是三十岁以上的老工人。他们不但使工厂恢复了生产，并在国民党破坏了工厂之后，又用自己的双手把它修复起来。他们的技术是从经验中得来的，缺少的就是文化。我记得我如何教给他们唱第一支歌子——东方红。我记得在开展文化学习时，一支铅笔握在老工人的手里，竟比一根拔杆还重。他们拿起了铅笔，眼睛既沉重又惶惑；但是当他写出中国共产党这五个字的时候，又像孩子一般地笑了。
    如果叫我在他们身上发现谁的身上吃的苦最多，也许有困难；然而如果谁有一册什么书，我却能一口就说出来。可是，现在不那么容易了。有文化的年青人这样多，而且差不多每个年青人又都读过“把一切献给党”。
    我曾经问过几个人：“你有‘把一切献给党’吗？”他们回答说：“我有一本；但是我寄给我的妹妹了。”“我也有一本，别人借去了。”或是，“我的那本，这不是还在枕头底下吗？”这册书的主人到底是谁，却是茫然没有下落。
    叫作“乌拉尔人”的三方电铲投入生产以后，展开了学习热潮。初中班，高中班及中等专业班都开始招生了。
    教育科的一个女同志，在电铲中队门口摆上一条凳子，她的背后一张白纸上写着职工夜校招生几个字，她的面前立刻围拢了一群年青人。挤在前面的一个说：“我是头一个吗？”
    “不，你们队长早就报名啦！”这位女同志答。
    “那就给我写上吧！”
    对话开始了。问他的年龄，答十九。问他入哪一班，答高小班。但是高小他已念过了。他不愿意再从头学代数，为了温习，就从下册开始吧！第二个人进初中班，问他有没有书的时候，他有些生气地答：“我学过的书都随身带着，这还用问吗？”第三个也是一样，进初中班……我站在他们身后，感到了他们的求知的热切的心，就像他们在三方电铲司机室中，所感到的滚烫的发动机一样。
    对话越来越嘈杂了，因为好几个人在争着报名。虽然他们知道每个人都有报名的机会；但是，他们觉得惟独自己的学习愿望，不能落在别人后面。
    三方电铲投入生产，已经快两个月了，而开电铲的仍是由兄弟厂矿临时调来的人。他们感谢这种支援；但是，他们却不能原谅自己，为什么不能在合同期满之前学好技术呢？自己是三级工人，三方电铲司机又需要六级技术，他们大胆地想：在这个突飞猛进的时代，可以被时间吓住吗？为什么不能跳过时间迎头赶上呢？
    电铲队的年青统计员，有一天对我说：他从小失去父母，流浪的生活使他喜爱哲学，也喜爱文学；但是他说他更爱技术和工作。那个星期六的午间我遇见了他，我问道：“你怎么不睡觉呢？”他揉着自己的眼睛对我说：“不，明天上午我要考试了！”第二天的午间，我正在午睡，他走来敲我的门，他小声地说道：“我考过了，把那本‘人民文学’借给我……”他去了之后，我想像着他一定考得很好，他的心刚刚为数字鼓舞过，现在又为这本厚厚的杂志颤抖着了……
    有一次又遇到书记同志，他忽然问我道：那册书的主人找到了吗？
    我怔了一会；但是我说：我找到了。那就是报名职工夜校的那些人。他们为了自己的技术既比不上苏联司机的水平，又比不上兄弟厂矿的司机水平，看去这似乎是一时不能克服的困难；但是这些把一切献给党的年青工人，今天在职工夜校报了名，就等于向党宣了誓，明天他们就是三方电铲优秀的司机，向岩石进军的先进工作者了。我记起了那个年青的统计员，心里想道：到处都是把一切献给党的人，将来纪录这些英勇的事迹的作者，也会同时出现的。
