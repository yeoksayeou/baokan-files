    The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, invited to visit our country, arrived in Beijing, the capital, the day before yesterday, led by Fred Oelssner, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

    Comrade Fred Oelssner is one of the leaders of the party and government of democratic Germany with a long history of revolutionary struggle. He currently serves as Deputy Prime Minister of Democratic Germany and Chairman of the Consumer Goods and People's Supply Committee.

    Comrade Oelssner was born on February 27, 1903. Both of his parents belonged to the left wing of the former German Social Democratic Party. Therefore, Comrade Oelssner was baptized in revolutionary struggle at an early age and dedicated himself to the cause of the working class.

    From 1918 to 1921, he was the head of the Halle-Merseburg district of the German Socialist Proletarian Youth League (later the Communist Youth League). In 1920, he joined the German Communist Party. In March 1921, when he was only seventeen years old, he was forced to go underground and was arrested in 1923 and sentenced to one year in prison on the charge of so-called "conspiracy to treason."

    At the end of 1921, Comrade Oelssner worked as an editor for party newspapers in many parts of Germany, and actively participated in the struggle against the betrayal policies of the Social Democratic leaders and right-wing opportunists. In 1926, he was sent to Moscow by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party to study. During his studies and subsequently in his teaching work as a professor of political economy, he had ample opportunity to learn from the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and to understand the practice of Soviet socialist construction.

    In 1932, Comrade Oelssner returned to Germany. The Party entrusted him with leading the work of the propaganda department. After the Hitler fascists seized power in Germany, Oelssner participated in the underground struggle against Nazi rule. At the end of 1933, according to the decision of the Central Committee, he left Germany again to carry out anti-fascist activities in several countries bordering Germany. In 1935, he went to the Soviet Union again to continue his teaching work.

    After the Soviet army defeated the German fascists, Comrade Oelssner returned to Germany to take up a leading position in the Party's ideological work. He served successively as the Minister of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee and the Minister of the Party's Study Department. At the Second Party Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party in September 1947, he was elected as a member of the Central Guidance Department of the German Socialist Unity Party, in January 1949, at the First Party Congress he was elected as Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and at the Third Party Congress he was elected as a member of the Politburo.

    Comrade Oelssner is currently also the editor-in-chief of "Unity," the theoretical journal of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party. In 1953, Comrade Oelssner was elected as an academician of the German Academy of Sciences for his contribution to economic science. Comrade Oelssner also received the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic for his book "On Economic Crisis."

    德意志民主共和国政府代表团团长
    弗列德·厄斯纳
    应我国政府邀请来访的德意志民主共和国政府代表团，在德意志民主共和国副总理弗列德·厄斯纳的率领下，已在前天到达首都北京。
    弗列德·厄斯纳同志是具有长期革命斗争历史的民主德国党和政府的领导人之一。目前他担任民主德国副总理兼消费品和人民供应委员会主席之职。
    厄斯纳同志生于1903年2月27日。他的双亲都属于过去的德国社会民主党的左翼。因此厄斯纳同志在早年就已受到革命斗争的洗礼，并献身于工人阶级的事业。
    从1918年至1921年，他是德国社会主义无产阶级青年团（后来的共产主义青年团）哈雷—麦尔赛堡区的负责人。1920年，他参加了德国共产党。1921年3月，当他还只有十七岁的时候，就被迫转入地下活动，并在1923年被捕，以所谓“阴谋叛国”的罪名而被判处一年徒刑。
    1921年底，厄斯纳同志曾在德国许多地方的党报担任编辑工作，并积极地参加了反对社会民主党领袖和右倾机会主义者的叛变政策的斗争。1926年他被德共中央派往莫斯科学习。在学习期间和随后作为政治经济学教授的教学工作中，他有充分的机会学习了苏联共产党丰富的斗争经验和了解了苏联社会主义建设的实践。
    1932年厄斯纳同志回到德国。党委托他领导宣传部门的工作。希特勒法西斯在德国攫取政权以后，厄斯纳就参加了反对纳粹统治的地下斗争。1933年底，根据中央的决定，他又离开德国到与德国毗邻的几个国家中去进行反法西斯活动。1935年，他再次前往苏联，继续他的教学工作。
    苏联军队战胜德国法西斯以后，厄斯纳同志又回到德国担任党的思想工作的领导职务。曾先后担任党中央的宣传鼓动部部长和党的学习部部长。在1947年9月德国统一社会党第二次党代表大会上，他当选为德国统一社会党中央指导部委员，在1949年1月第一次党代表会议上当选为中央委员会书记处书记，在第三次党代表大会上当选为政治局委员。
    厄斯纳同志现在还兼任德国统一社会党中央理论性杂志“统一”的主编。1953年，由于厄斯纳同志对经济科学方面的贡献而被选为德国科学院正式院士。厄斯纳同志还曾以他的著作“论经济危机”一书而获得德意志民主共和国的国家奖金。
