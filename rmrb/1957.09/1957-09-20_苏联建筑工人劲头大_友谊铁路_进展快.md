　　Soviet Construction Workers Show Great Enthusiasm
　　"Friendship Railway" Progresses Rapidly
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 19th: Soviet construction workers building the "Friendship Railway" from Aktogay to the Chinese Xinjiang border have completed this year's track-laying plan, laying ninety kilometers of track. The workers decided to lay another forty-four kilometers of track by the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
    Currently, road construction is proceeding intensely on a two-hundred-kilometer stretch of the line. Workers have penetrated deep into the Sarykum Desert area. Despite harsh weather and difficult supply conditions, the speed of road construction has been increasing. The work of building the roadbed, laying tracks, and erecting bridges is progressing simultaneously.
    In the past two and a half months, bridge workers have repaired more than one hundred bridges of various sizes. They are now repairing the bridge over the Jienteke River and are preparing to complete this longest bridge on the line before the October Revolution celebration. It is expected that the line will be open to traffic to Ucharal station before the October Revolution celebration, which is about one-third of the entire line.

　　苏联建筑工人劲头大
　　“友谊铁路”进展快
    新华社莫斯科19日电　建筑阿克斗卡到中国新疆边界的“友谊铁路”的苏联建筑工人已经完成了今年的铺轨计划，铺好了九十公里的轨道。工人们决定到十月革命四十周年时再铺轨四十四公里。
    现在，筑路工作正在长达二百公里的线路上紧张进行。工人们已经深入萨雷库姆沙漠地带。在恶劣的气候和供应困难的条件下，筑路的速度一直在增加。筑路基、铺轨道架桥梁的工作都在齐头并进。
    两个半月来，桥梁工人已经修好一百多座大小桥梁，现在他们正在修坚捷克河上的桥梁，并且准备在十月革命节前把这座线路上最长的桥梁修好。预计，在十月革命节前，线路可以通车到乌恰拉尔站，约等于全线的三分之一。
