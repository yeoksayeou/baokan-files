Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - Vientiane dispatch: After a break of nearly six months, the meeting between the political delegations of the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces resumed on September 16th.

　　A meeting between the Lao sides on April 6th this year pointed out that the two sides had reached agreements on some important issues, such as the cessation of hostilities, peaceful neutrality, and guaranteeing the civil rights of the Lao Fighting Forces. The meeting believed that these agreements conformed to the spirit of the Geneva Accords and the joint statement signed by Prime Minister Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong on December 28th last year regarding the establishment of a coalition government to unify the country, and were a step forward in the process of resolving political issues related to both sides.

　　However, after this, the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France sent notes to the Lao government on April 16th, containing the same content of interfering in Laos' internal affairs to obstruct the country's unification; at the same time, efforts to restore peace and unification in Laos were also obstructed by certain domestic forces. The meeting between the political delegations of the two sides was thus interrupted.

　　On August 8th this year, in a speech requesting reauthorization to form a cabinet, Prince Phouma reiterated the Royal Government's position of strictly adhering to the agreement between the two sides on the establishment of a coalition government, and stated that it would restore the unification of the Kingdom of Laos by resolving the issue of the Lao Fighting Forces.

　　老挝双方恢复政治谈判
    新华社河内17日电　万象消息：老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方的政治代表团之间的会议，在停顿了将近六个月之后，在9月16日重新恢复举行会议。
    老挝双方在今年4月6日举行的一次会议曾经指出，双方的谈判已经在一些重要的问题，如关于停止敌对行动、和平中立、保障寮国战斗部队的公民权等方面达成协议。会议认为，这些已经达成的协议符合于日内瓦协定和富马首相同苏发努冯亲王在去年12月28日签署的关于成立联合政府以统一国家的联合声明的精神，并且是解决同双方有关的政治问题的过程中的一个进展。
    但是，在此以后，英美法三国政府在4月16日分别把内容相同的干涉老挝内政以阻挠这个国家统一的照会交给老挝政府；同时，为恢复老挝和平统一所作的努力也遇到国内某些势力的阻挠。双方政治代表团之间的会议就此中断。
    今年8月8日，富马亲王在要求重新授权组阁的演说中，曾经重申王国政府严格遵守双方关于成立联合政府的协议的立场，并且表示将通过解决寮国战斗部队的问题来恢复老挝王国的统一。
