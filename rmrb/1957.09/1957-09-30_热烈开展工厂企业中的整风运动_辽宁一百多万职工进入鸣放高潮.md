	Enthusiastically Carry Out Rectification Movement in Factories and Enterprises
	More Than One Million Workers in Liaoning Enter Climax of Airing Views
	(Our dispatch from Shenyang, September 29th) The rectification movement and socialist education movement in factories and enterprises have been launched successively in ten industrial cities in Liaoning, and a climax of airing views by more than one million workers in the province is rapidly forming.
	The medium-sized plants, the First Steelmaking Plant, the First Medium Plate Plant, and the Primary Rolling Mill affiliated to Anshan Iron and Steel Company have all successively started airing views. Some factories have posted five or six hundred big-character posters. On the first day of airing views in the medium-sized plant, the masses criticized some Party members for having excessively high wages on big-character posters. Communist Party members Shi Xiaoxian and two others took the initiative to request a one-level reduction in their wages the next day. The Party Committee has agreed to their request and decided to implement it starting in October. The big-character posters of the First Steelmaking Plant criticized Lin Shifu, a labor protection committee member of the trade union, for not caring about the welfare of workers. Lin Shifu recorded these criticisms and humbly expressed his determination to thoroughly change his style. Thirty-two factories in Yingkou City have started airing views. The Yingkou Paper Mill has posted three thousand big-character posters. Workers criticized the poor quality of the chimneys in the factory's newly built buildings and wrote a doggerel: "The chimney has a bulging belly, the leaders are endlessly worried, who is responsible, find out quickly." Now the factory leaders are organizing forces to solve this problem. After the big-character posters criticized the problem of queuing in the canteen, the deputy director immediately went to the canteen to study improvements, and the situation has now changed. The Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a mobilization meeting on September 20th to immediately enter the rectification campaign in factories and enterprises. 80% of the coking workers in the Benxi First Coking Plant have expressed their opinions. After the Party Committee Secretary saw workers criticizing him for not being thorough enough in his work style in the big-character posters, he immediately rearranged his work and took time to go to the site to talk with the workers and listen to their opinions. Leading personnel in the departments also took the initiative to go to the workshops to transcribe criticisms on the big-character posters and promptly study and deal with them. Workers of the Xinqiu Mine in Fuxin have posted more than one thousand big-character posters, raising more than six thousand opinions. All pit entrances and workshops have set up "Airing Views Gardens." Members of the Mine Party Committee, the Mine Director, and the Chief Engineer all go to various units every day to study the criticisms raised by the workers. Twelve factories and enterprises in Andong City have started airing views. 65% of the more than 3,000 opinions raised by the workers of the Andong Railway Sub-bureau have been dealt with and improved. Seven factories in Jinzhou City have started airing views. The three cities of Lushun-Dalian, Fushun, and Liaoyang have also launched large-scale airing views in pilot factories. (Attached picture)
