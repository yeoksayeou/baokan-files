    In the all-out counterattack against the bourgeois right-wingers on the political and ideological fronts, the literary and art circles exposed the anti-Party activities of Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, Feng Xuefeng, Jiang Feng, Zhong Dianfei, and others. This is a principled struggle to distinguish between right and wrong, and it is a struggle between the Party's socialist literary and art line and the anti-Party, anti-socialist literary and art line. The outcome of this struggle will inevitably have a far-reaching impact on the literary and art circles.
    The differences between the Party's literary and art line and the anti-Party literary and art line are concentrated in these fundamental issues: Should literature and art serve the broad masses of workers and peasants and the great cause of socialism, or should they only be regarded as the cause of individuals or a few people, only to satisfy personal desires for fame, gain, and ambition? Should literary and art work unconditionally accept the leadership of the Party, or should it reject or weaken this leadership? The Party insists that literature and art must serve politics and must be subordinate to the revolutionary tasks of each revolutionary period. Today, literature and art must serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and inspire people to build a socialist motherland. Therefore, our literature and art are part of the entire socialist cause; and the Party, like all other work, must correctly lead the literary and art work; only this leadership can guarantee the healthy development of the socialist literary and art cause. What the bourgeois right-wingers and all kinds of anti-Party elements hate and attack most is the Party's leadership over literary and art work. They oppose the Party's leadership over literature and art, and their purpose is to make literature and art deviate from the socialist track and become a tool for serving the bourgeoisie.
    Although anti-Party elements wear all kinds of disguises, they are consistent in opposing the Party's leadership. This is the case with the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique and the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique. Like all right-wing elements, they always say that the Party does not understand literature and art, so it cannot lead literary and art work, and only they understand literature and art, so they are qualified to lead. Let's take a look at how they "lead": they regard the work units or departments that the Party entrusts to them as their private territory and independent kingdoms, and they implement some of the Party's policies and decisions that they like, and they either feign compliance or simply reject those that they don't like. They regard the Party's leadership and supervision as interference and restraint on them. In order to cultivate their own power as capital for their independence from the Party, they engage in back-scratching, mutual praise, and unprincipled emotional enticements, and they unite some dissatisfied elements with anti-Party sentiments, and whenever there is an opportunity, they "launch a full-scale attack" on the Party. It is obvious that if these anti-Party cliques are allowed to exist and develop, there is no way to implement the Party's policies and realize the Party's leadership in the field of literature and art, and the Party's socialist literary and art cause will inevitably be seriously damaged and harmed.
    The common ideological basis of these anti-Party elements is serious bourgeois individualism. They regard the literary and art cause as a means to obtain personal fame and position, so they become arrogant and complacent as soon as they achieve some success, and they have no regard for the organization. The higher their personal "reputation" is, the lower the Party's position in their minds becomes. When they are successful, they are arrogant and put themselves above the Party. No one can lead them. They only want to listen to flattery, but they don't want to hear a word of criticism. When they are slightly dissatisfied, they are full of complaints and resentment, as if the Party and the people owe them an unpayable debt. They use decadent bourgeois ideas to corrupt the literary and art circles, and they spread poison among writers and artists inside and outside the Party, especially among young literary and art workers. They advocate "one-bookism," saying that "with a work, no one can defeat you," and they regard works as capital for bargaining with the Party and the people. They encourage pride, haggle over personal gains and losses and personal grudges, put private interests and private friendships above collective interests, and advocate "a scholar dies for his confidant," instead of teaching people to be humble and prudent and to serve the cause of the Party and the people loyally. They regard themselves as a special "spiritual aristocracy" in the Party's literary and art ranks. Under the influence of this bad atmosphere, in recent years, serious bourgeois individualism has grown among many literary and art workers. They are divorced from the people, unwilling to go to the masses, unwilling to live a hard life, unwilling to engage in hard work (including creative work), and are keen on pursuing fame and gain, forgetting the sacred duty of serving the people. They are becoming more and more estranged from the Party, and gradually feel that the Party is not theirs. Some people even become morally corrupt and degenerate in their lives, and lose the qualities that ordinary citizens should have. They have insulted the glorious title of "soul engineers" and have become veritable "soul蛀虫"!
    The bourgeois individualistic literary and art line advocated and practiced by these anti-Party elements is incompatible with the Party's socialist literary and art line, and with the wishes and practices of the majority of upright literary and art workers who are willing to serve the people and are willing to make progress. Therefore, they try every possible means to undermine the Party's leadership over literary and art work. On the one hand, they spread various anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-Marxist views in literary and art thought. On the other hand, they use the methods of sowing discord, wooing this one, and attacking that one to undermine and divide the unity of the literary and art circles from the organizational aspect. They were once encouraged by the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident and妄想to replicate such a situation in China. They distort the correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward by the Party from the standpoint and viewpoint of the bourgeois right-wingers. They do not understand or are unwilling to understand that the implementation of this policy is to develop Marxism-Leninism and socialist literature and art through free debate and free competition. They mistakenly believe that we Communists will abandon the position of Marxism-Leninism on the ideological front and will bow down before the decadent bourgeois ideology and reactionary literature and art like them. They mistakenly believe that literature and art can henceforth deviate from the lofty goal of serving the people and serving socialism, and regard the exposure and description of the dark side of the people's lives in the new society as the primary task of literary and art creation, which is actually to turn literature and art into a weapon to attack and slander the socialist system. Our Party has always pointed out that poisonous weeds must be eradicated; they turn a deaf ear to this. Therefore, when the bourgeois right-wing elements used the rectification campaign to launch a rampant attack on the Party, these anti-Party elements immediately echoed each other internally and externally, and stirred up a妖风in the literary and art circles, attempting to force the Party to accept their literary and art propositions and satisfy their personal desires in this atmosphere. And if their goals are not achieved, they want to choose the opportunity to publicly withdraw from the literary and art organizations led by the Party, and use this method to blackmail the Party; they also secretly plan the so-called "fellow publication" in order to confront the literary and art publications led by the Party. Originally, literary and art organizations are voluntary organizations, and writers can withdraw for legitimate reasons, but since they are Party members, they should be subject to the Party's discipline. They neither ask the Party for instructions nor report to the Party, but they prepare to launch a sudden attack on the Party by withdrawing from the Writers Association, which is obviously not a normal behavior, but a conspiracy with ulterior motives; especially Ding Ling, as one of the leaders of the Writers Association, her method is obviously to create chaos in the literary and art circles, to confuse domestic and foreign public opinion, in order to achieve the purpose of splitting the literary and art cause led by the Party. It is not impossible for writers to create publications according to the principle of free competition in artistic forms and styles, under the unified arrangement and consent of literary and art organizations, but they want to use the so-called "fellow publications" to promote anti-Party literary and art ideas and literary and art lines, and use the publications as capital to accumulate strength and as a base for carrying out anti-Party activities. They have such ulterior motives. They only leak their plans to bourgeois right-wing elements, but completely behind the back of the Party organization and the literary and art organizations. These conspiratorial plans are obviously a challenge to the Party.
    Our literary and art ranks have grown and developed under the leadership and influence of the Party, and in the battle against common enemies. This is an extremely valuable team. We rely on this team to attack and defeat the feudal comprador and bourgeois literature and art, and gradually establish and develop the new literature and art of the people, forming a strong literary and art front. Since the liberation of the whole country, under the leadership and care of the Party and the state, this team has been continuously expanding, its members have been continuously improving in ideology and art, and the literary and art circles have found a solid foundation for unity under the common belief of serving the working people. The firm unity of this team and the strong leadership of the Party over this team are the fundamental key to ensuring the socialist road of our literature and art. We will never allow anyone to split this team, to undermine or weaken the Party's leadership over this team.
    Party and non-Party communist writers and artists are the core force of this vast literary and art team. This core must faithfully follow the Party's literary and art line, resolutely implement the Party's literary and art policies, and closely unite literary and art workers in all aspects around the Party. They should have lofty thoughts and morals, and influence people with socialist spirit not only in their works but also in their actual lives. Our writers and artists have full freedom to create artistic forms and artistic styles, and have full freedom to give full play to their personal talents, but no one is allowed to use this freedom to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Our writers and artists have full freedom to learn from each other, observe each other, and can form different schools of thought in creation and artistic style, but no one is allowed to engage in small sectarianism and anti-Party cliques in secret, no matter how old they are and how big their "reputation" is! Our country is consolidated, so we have the confidence to put forward the slogan of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." We are not afraid of poisonous weeds, because we can eradicate poisonous weeds and fertilize the fields. However, poisonous weeds must be eradicated. Anyone who wants to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, who wants to engage in anti-Party cliques, we must stand up and argue for what is right and wrong, and we must ruthlessly expose them by presenting the facts and reasoning.
    Why do these "old writers" and "old Party members" in the literary and art circles dare to be so lawless and engage in anti-Party activities for a long time? In addition to the fact that they have deeply rooted bourgeois individualistic ideological roots, the Party organizations in the literary and art circles have not strictly supervised them, and they have often adopted an attitude of appeasement and sentimentalism when criticizing and dealing with their wrong thoughts and actions, which is also one of the important reasons. This is a serious lesson. Therefore, this struggle against the anti-Party clique must be carried out resolutely to the end. On the one hand, we must thoroughly expose their anti-Party facts, tear off all their masks, and thoroughly criticize their anti-Party ideas, and we must not allow them to muddle through and make a comeback. Only in this way can we educate the vast number of literary and art workers, educate the younger generation, and enable many of them to develop immunity. Only in this way can we save some of the anti-Party elements who can still be saved. Appeasement is enough to breed evil. Sentimentalism seems to love people on the surface, but it actually harms people, and it will ruin our entire literary and art cause and literary and art ranks. Therefore, we must abandon sentimentalism, we must mobilize the vast number of literary and art workers to participate in the struggle, let everyone be tempered in the fire of the struggle, thoroughly burn the decadent individualism and liberalism, and not allow any anti-Party ambitious people to take advantage of the opportunity. All literary and art workers should learn from this struggle, be vigilant, never be proud, always maintain close contact with the working people, and always follow the Party and the people forward, and do not lag behind; as long as you leave the Party and leave the people, you will lag behind and be abandoned by the times.
    The future of our socialist country is infinitely bright; the future of the socialist literary and art cause is also infinitely bright. From this struggle, we can see that under the socialist system, it is not that there will be no so-called "literary and art workers" who are infiltrated with bourgeois ideas. In order to cultivate a vast literary and art team of the working class, we must learn from past work, formulate methods, and try our best to ensure that our literary and art team becomes a literary and art team of the working class rather than the bourgeoisie. This requires everyone in the literary and art circles to discuss and work hard!

### 为保卫社会主义文艺路线而斗争

    为保卫社会主义文艺路线而斗争
    在政治战线和思想战线上全面反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，文学艺术界揭发了丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰、江丰、钟惦棐等人的反党活动。这是一场辨明大是大非的原则性的斗争，是党的社会主义文艺路线跟反党、反社会主义的文艺路线的斗争。这场斗争的结果，必将在文艺界产生深远的影响。
    党的文艺路线和反党的文艺路线的分歧，集中表现在这样一些根本问题上：文艺应当为广大工农群众服务，为社会主义的伟大事业服务呢，还是只作为个人的或少数人的事业，只为满足个人的名利欲望和野心？文艺工作应当无条件地接受党的领导呢，还是拒绝或者削弱这种领导？党坚持文艺必须为政治服务，必须服从于各个革命时期的革命任务。在今天来说，文艺就是要为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，要鼓舞人们去建设社会主义的祖国。因此，我们的文艺是整个社会主义事业的一部分；而党对于文艺工作，如同对其它一切工作一样，必须正确地加以领导；只有这种领导才能保证社会主义文艺事业的健康发展。资产阶级右派分子和各种反党分子所切齿痛恨和集中攻击的，正是党对于文艺工作的领导。他们反对党领导文艺，其目的就是要使文艺脱离社会主义的轨道，使文艺成为给资产阶级服务的工具。
    反党分子尽管披着各色各样的外衣，在反对党的领导这一点上，他们是一致的。丁玲、陈企霞反党集团、江丰反党集团都是这样。和一切右派分子一样，他们总是说党不懂文艺，因此不能领导文艺工作，只有他们才是懂得文艺的，因此才有资格领导。请看一看他们是怎样“领导”的吧：他们把党委托给他们领导的工作单位或工作部门，当作自己私人的地盘和独立王国，对于党的方针和决定，合意的就执行一些，不合意的就阳奉阴违或根本拒绝。他们把党的领导和监督，看作是对于他们的干涉和束缚。为了培植自己的势力，作为他们向党闹独立性的资本，他们到处拉拉扯扯，吹吹拍拍，进行无原则的感情拉拢，把一些具有反党情绪的不满分子结合起来，一有机会，就“倾巢出犯”向党进攻。很明显，让这类反党小集团存在和发展下去，就休想在文艺方面贯彻党的方针，实现党的领导，党的社会主义的文艺事业就一定要受到严重的破坏和损害。
    这些反党分子的共同思想基础，是严重的资产阶级个人主义。他们把文艺事业看作猎取个人名位的手段，所以，稍有成就，就骄傲自大，目无组织，个人的“声望”越高，党在他们心目中的地位就越低。他们在得意的时候，趾高气扬，把自己放在党的上面，谁也不能领导他们，他们只愿听奉承话，而不愿听一句批评他们的话。他们稍不如意，就牢骚满腹，怨气冲天，好像党和人民欠了他们还不清的债似的。他们用腐朽的资产阶级思想去腐蚀文艺界，在党内外作家、艺术家中间，特别是在青年文艺工作者中间散布毒素。他们提倡“一本书主义”，说“有了作品，便谁也打不倒”，把作品当作向党向人民讨价还价的资本。他们鼓励骄傲，斤斤计较个人得失和个人恩怨，把私人利益和私人友情放在集体利益之上，提倡“士为知己者死”，而不是教人谦虚谨慎地去为党和人民的事业效劳尽忠。他们把自己看成党的文艺队伍中的一种特殊的“精神贵族”。在这种恶劣风气的影响下，近年来，在许多文艺工作者中间滋长着严重的资产阶级个人主义的思想作风，他们脱离人民，不愿到群众中去，不愿过艰苦的生活，不愿从事艰苦的劳动（包括创作的劳动在内），而热中于追求名利，忘记了为人民服务的神圣职责。他们一天天和党疏远，渐渐感觉党不是他们的了。有的人甚至在生活方面道德败坏，腐化堕落，失去了普通公民应有的品质。他们侮辱了“灵魂工程师”的光荣称号，而变成了不折不扣的“灵魂的蛀虫”！
    这些反党分子所提倡和实行的资产阶级个人主义的文艺路线，跟党的社会主义文艺路线，跟大多数愿意为人民服务，愿意进步的正派的文艺工作者的愿望和实践，显然是不能相容的。因此，他们就千方百计地破坏党对文艺工作的领导，一方面在文艺思想上散播种种反党、反人民、反马克思主义的观点，另一方面，用挑拨离间，拉拢这个，打击那个的手法，从组织上破坏和分裂文艺界的团结。他们曾经从匈牙利反革命事件受到了鼓舞，妄想在中国如法炮制那样的局面。他们从资产阶级右派的立场观点来曲解党所提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的正确方针。他们不了解或者不愿意了解，实行这个方针是为了通过自由辩论和自由竞赛的方法来发展马克思列宁主义思想，发展社会主义文艺；他们错误地以为我们共产党人会在思想战线上放弃马克思列宁主义的阵地，会像他们那样，也在腐朽透顶的资产阶级的思想和反动的文艺面前拜倒；他们错误地以为文艺从此可以离开为人民服务、为社会主义服务的崇高目标，而把揭露和描写新社会人民生活中的阴暗面作为文艺创作的首要任务，实际就是要把文艺变成攻击和诽谤社会主义制度的武器。我们党经常指出，毒草是必须锄掉的；他们对此却充耳不闻。因此，当资产阶级右派分子利用整风向党发动猖狂进攻的时候，这些反党分子就立刻里应外合，在文艺界刮起了一股妖风，企图在这种空气下迫使党接受他们的文艺主张，满足他们的个人欲望。而如果他们的目的达不到，他们就想选择时机，公开退出党所领导的文艺团体，用这个办法来向党要挟；他们还背着党秘密筹办所谓“同人刊物”，以便同党所领导的文艺刊物相对抗。本来，文艺团体是自愿结合的组织，作家是可以根据正当理由退出的，但是，他们既然作为党员，就应该受到党的纪律的约束，他们既不向党请示，也不向党报告，却准备以退出作家协会的办法来向党发动突然的进攻，这就显然不是正常的行为，而是别有用心的阴谋；特别是作为作家协会领导人之一的丁玲，她的这个手段，很明显地是为了在文艺界造成混乱，是为了迷惑国内外的视听，以达到其分裂党所领导的文艺事业的目的。作家根据艺术形式和艺术风格自由竞赛的原则，在文艺团体的统一安排和同意之下，创办刊物，本来也不是不可以的事情，但他们却要通过所谓“同人刊物”宣传反党的文艺思想和文艺路线，并且以刊物为资本，积蓄力量，作为进行反党活动的基地。他们怀着这样不可告人的目的。他们只向资产阶级右派分子泄漏他们的计划，却完全背着党的组织，背着文艺团体。这些阴谋计划，显然是对党的挑战。
    我们的文艺队伍，是在党的领导和影响下、在反对共同敌人的战斗中发展壮大起来的。这是一支极可宝贵的队伍。我们依靠这支队伍，打击了并且战胜了封建买办和资产阶级的文艺，逐步建立和发展了人民的革命的新文艺，组成了一条有力的文艺战线。全国解放以来，在党和国家的领导和关怀之下，这支队伍不断扩大，它的成员在思想上和艺术上不断提高，文艺界在为劳动人民服务的共同信念下找到了团结的坚固基础。这个队伍的牢固的团结和党对于这支队伍的坚强的领导，是保证我们的文艺的社会主义道路的根本关键。我们决不容许任何人来分裂这支队伍，来破坏或削弱党对于这支队伍的领导。
    党和非党的共产主义作家、艺术家是这支广大的文艺队伍的核心力量。这个核心必须忠实地遵循党的文艺路线，坚决地执行党的文艺政策，使各方面文艺工作者紧密地团结在党的周围。他们应当具有崇高的思想、品德，不但在作品中，而且在实际生活中，用社会主义精神影响人们。我们的作家、艺术家有创造艺术形式和艺术风格的充分自由，有发挥个人才能的充分自由，但是，决不容许任何人利用这种自由来进行反党、反社会主义的活动。我们的作家、艺术家有充分的自由可以互相学习、观摩，并且可以结成创作上和艺术风格上的不同流派，但是，决不容许任何人有暗地里搞小宗派、搞反党集团的自由，不管他们有多老的资格，有多大的“声望”！我们的国家是巩固的，因此我们有信心提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的口号。我们不怕毒草，因为可以把毒草锄掉，并且可以肥田。但是，毒草是必须锄掉的。任何人要搞反党反社会主义的活动，要搞反党集团，我们就要起来为大是大非而大争，就要用摆事实、讲道理的办法无情地揭露他们。
    为什么这些文艺界的“老作家”、“老党员”敢于这样无法无天，长期进行反党活动呢？除了因为他们有根深蒂固的资产阶级个人主义的思想根源之外，文艺界的党组织对他们监督不严，在批判和处理他们的错误思想行动的时候，往往采取了姑息和温情主义的态度，也是重要原因之一。这是严重的教训。所以，这一次对反党集团的斗争，必须坚决地进行到底。一方面，必须彻底揭露他们的反党事实，撕破他们的一切假面具，彻底批判他们的反党思想，决不能让他们蒙混过关，卷土重来。只有这样做法，才能教育广大的文艺工作者，教育青年的一代，使他们中间许许多多的人产生免疫力。也只有这样做法，才有可能把反党分子中还可以挽救的一部分人挽救出来。姑息足以养奸。温情主义表面上看来似乎是爱人，实际上却是害人，它会断送我们整个的文艺事业和文艺队伍。因此，必须抛弃温情主义，必须动员广大文艺工作者参加斗争，让大家在斗争的烈火中锻炼，把腐朽的个人主义、自由主义彻底烧毁，不让任何反党野心家有隙可乘。所有文艺工作者都应当从这场斗争中吸取教训，警惕自己，永远不要骄傲，永远和劳动人民保持密切联系，永远跟着党和人民一道前进，不要落后；只要离开党，离开人民，就会落后，就会被时代所抛弃。
    我国社会主义的前途是无限光明的；社会主义文艺事业的前途也是无限光明的。从这次斗争中，我们可以看到，在社会主义的制度之下，也并不是不会产生浸透资产阶级思想的所谓“文艺家”的。为了培养出工人阶级的广大的文艺队伍，我们要从过去的工作中吸收经验，规定出办法，来尽可能地保证我们的文艺队伍成为工人阶级的而不是资产阶级的文艺队伍。这需要文艺界大家来讨论，大家来努力！
