Letters to the Editor

In the infographic "Coal Saved in a Year" published on page 5 of your newspaper on September 13th, the fourth line of the explanatory text for the traveling ship in the upper left corner, "220浬" (220 nautical miles), is a mistake and should read "220万浬" (2.2 million nautical miles). Please correct it.
