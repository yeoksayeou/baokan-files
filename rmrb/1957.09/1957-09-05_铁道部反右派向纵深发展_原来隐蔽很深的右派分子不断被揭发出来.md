The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Railways, involving over six thousand people, is developing vigorously and in depth. The symposiums for senior intellectuals and engineering technicians held by the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Railways have convened twenty times, with over one hundred and thirty people speaking at the meetings. Over six thousand people in various units listened to the wired broadcasts. The symposiums held by various railway administrations have had over three thousand two hundred and sixty participants. The vast majority of those who previously held a neutral attitude have turned to the left, and Rightists who were formerly deeply hidden are also constantly being exposed by the masses.

    **The Masses are Highly Motivated; They Automatically Study the Situation**

Currently, the masses' morale is very high. They are automatically studying the situation, organizing materials, and the number of Rightists being unearthed is increasing daily. The newly discovered Rightists largely did not reveal themselves very clearly during the period of the Great Blooming and Letting Contend. Some people, cloaked in Marxist-Leninist garb, peddled revisionist wares, and made various attacks on fundamental issues such as the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat. For example, Luo Li, a Rightist exposed by the Capital Construction Bureau, held relatively systematic revisionist fallacies. Some Rightist cliques were also unearthed through the masses' active investigation. For example, in the process of struggling against the Rightist Wu Zhaolong at the Factory Design Institute, a Rightist clique headed by Zhou Zhilian was discovered. In the past, Rightist cliques had only been discovered in individual units such as the Academy of Railway Sciences. With the deepening of the mass struggle, Rightist cliques have been discovered in units such as the Factory Design Institute, the Railway Cultural Troupe, and the Statistics Bureau. The People's Railway newspaper also exposed an anti-Party group headed by Deputy Editor-in-Chief Fan Sifu.

    **Party Leadership Group Assigns Responsibilities and Provides Specific Guidance and Supervision**

The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Railways has consistently been conducted under the leadership of the Party Leadership Group with a planned and step-by-step approach. This is the biggest characteristic that has enabled the anti-Rightist struggle in this ministry to form such a broad mass movement and to deepen the struggle step by step. All members of the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Railways directly participated in the leadership of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle. The members of the Party Leadership Group provided specific guidance and supervision in the units they were responsible for, according to their respective divisions of labor. The Party Leadership Group held at least one meeting each week to discuss the instructions from higher authorities, listen to reports, study the situation, and decide on plans. They also took the time to conduct individual conversations with senior intellectuals to help them raise their understanding. In order to handle the masses' beneficial criticisms and suggestions, and to study the Rightists' remarks, the rectification campaign leadership group of this ministry also drew one hundred and eight cadres to form a rectification campaign office, and formed several specialized groups for handling issues related to anti-corruption, anti-waste, anti-bureaucracy, suppression of counterrevolutionaries, systemic reforms, personnel and wages, and welfare, responsible for handling the daily affairs of the anti-Rightist struggle and improving work. The Party Leadership Group also promptly criticized and corrected the Right-leaning thoughts of the leading personnel of certain units. Now, the leading personnel of various railway administrations are personally presiding over meetings to help the masses analyze problems, and some are even personally guiding the work of big-character posters and blackboard newspapers.

    **Two Months of Struggle are Better than Several Years of Political Classes**

Through presenting facts and reasoning, the understanding of the broad masses has been universally improved, and the vast majority of middle-of-the-roaders have turned to the left. In particular, some elderly engineers have ideologically drawn a clear line with the Rightists in the struggle, which has greatly influenced the masses. For example, when the staff of the Ministry of Railways struggled against the Rightist Du Zhenyuan (Counselor of the Counselor's Office, former Director of the Kuomintang Yuehan Railway Bureau, alternate member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, and puppet National Assembly representative), Engineer Mao Yixin, Deputy Director of the Technology Bureau, after several days of repeated consideration, broke with the sentiment of being old colleagues for thirty years, resolutely participated in the struggle, righteously refuted Du Zhenyuan's Rightist remarks, and exposed his consistent reactionary stance. After participating in the debate, Mao Yixin felt physically and mentally happy and his understanding improved. Engineers Guo Haoran of the Capital Construction Bureau, Ma Jiaju of the Materials Bureau, and Zhang Yiren of the Engineering General Bureau all actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle. When criticizing the Rightists, they first examined some of their own erroneous remarks. Shi Zhiren, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, Lin Shibo, Chief Engineer of the Design General Bureau, Lang Zhonglai, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the Factory Management Bureau, and Wang Xicheng, professor of Beijing Railway College, all made powerful criticisms of the Rightists Wang Beiqiang, Du Zhenyuan, and others at the conference. The broad masses of young staff also actively participated in the struggle, and Chen Jiyan, an economic planner from the Capital Construction Bureau, and others made reasoned and well-founded speeches. In the past stage, many engineering technicians felt that the anti-Rightist struggle had greatly educated them. They realized the importance of ideological remolding and the danger of neglecting politics. They said: Two months of struggle are better than several years of political classes.

Currently, the Ministry of Railways is conducting a great debate on fundamental issues such as the Party's leadership, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the socialist system, in order to thoroughly shatter the Rightists' fallacies and further raise the socialist consciousness of the broad masses.

### 铁道部反右派向纵深发展  原来隐蔽很深的右派分子不断被揭发出来

    铁道部反右派向纵深发展
    原来隐蔽很深的右派分子不断被揭发出来
    本报讯　铁道部机关六千多人的反右派斗争正在以浩荡的声势向纵深发展。铁道部党组召开的高级知识分子和工程技术人员的座谈会已经开过二十次，有一百三十余人在会上发了言，各单位收听有线广播的有六千余人；各局开的座谈会已有三千二百六十余人发言。原来抱中间态度的绝大部分已经向左转，原来隐蔽很深的右派分子也不断地被群众揭发出来。
    群众斗志高昂  自动研究情况
    现在，群众的斗志十分高昂，群众自动研究情况，整理材料，挖掘出来的右派分子正在一天天增加。新发掘出来的右派分子，大部分在大鸣大放的期间暴露得不很明显，有些人披着马列主义的外衣，贩卖修正主义的私货，对社会主义制度、无产阶级专政等根本性的问题，做了各式各样的攻击，像基建局揭发出来的右派分子罗离，就有比较系统的修正主义谬论。有些右派小集团，也是在群众积极追查中挖掘出来的。例如工厂设计事务所在斗争右派分子吴肇隆的时候，发现了以周志连为首的右派小集团。过去，只有铁道科学研究院等个别单位发现右派小集团，随着群众斗争的深入开展，工厂设计事务所、铁路文工团、统计局等单位都发现了右派小集团。人民铁道报社也揭发了以副总编辑范四夫为首的反党集团。
    党组分工负责  具体指导督促
    铁道部的反右派斗争一直是在党组领导下有计划有步骤进行的，这是这个部反右派斗争所以能够形成如此广泛的群众运动，而且使斗争步步深入的一个最大的特点。铁道部的党组全体同志都直接参加了整风与反右派斗争的领导，党组成员均按分工负责的单位具体指导督促，党组每周至少举行一次会议讨论上级指示，听取汇报，研究情况，决定计划。并抽出时间对高级知识分子进行个别谈话，帮助他们提高认识。为了处理群众有益的批评和建议，并研究右派分子的言论，这个部的整风领导小组还抽调一百零八个干部成立了整风办公室，和组成了三反、肃反、体制、人事工资、生活福利等几个专门小组，负责处理反右派斗争的日常事务和改进工作方面的问题。对于某些单位领导人员的右倾思想，党组也及时进行了批判与纠正。现在，各局的领导人员都亲自主持会议，帮助群众分析问题，有的还亲自指导大字报、黑板报的工作。
    两个月的斗争  胜过几年政治课
    通过摆事实、讲道理，广大群众的认识普遍提高，绝大多数中间分子已经向左转，特别是有些老年工程师在斗争中同右派分子划清了思想界限，对群众影响很大。如在铁道部工作人员对右派分子杜镇远（参事室参事，曾任国民党粤汉路局局长、国民党中央候补委员及伪国大代表）进行斗争时，技术局副局长茅以新工程师，经过几天的反复思考，打破了三十年老同事的情面，毅然参加斗争，理直气壮地驳斥了杜镇远的右派言行，并揭露他的一贯反动立场。茅以新在参加论战后，感觉到身心愉快，认识提高。基建局工程师郭浩然，材料局工程师马家驹、工程总局工程师张逸人等都积极地参加反右派斗争，他们在批驳右派的时候，首先对自己的某些错误言论作了检查。铁道部副部长石志仁、设计总局总工程师林诗伯、工厂管理局副局长兼总工程师郎钟騋以及北京铁道学院教授汪禧成等均在大会上对右派分子王北强、杜镇远等作了有力的批驳。广大青年工作人员也积极参加了斗争，基建局经济计划员陈继炎等作了有理有据的发言。在过去一个阶段里，许多工程技术人员感到反右派斗争给他们的教育很大，他们认识到思想改造的重要，认识到忽视政治的危险。他们说：两个月的斗争，胜过几年的政治课。
    现在，铁道部正在进行关于党的领导、无产阶级专政、社会主义制度等根本性问题的大辩论，以彻底粉碎右派分子的谬论，进一步提高广大群众的社会主义觉悟。
