　　The Third National Women's Congress of China opens today in the capital. This is the first large gathering of representatives of women from all over the country since our country entered the period of socialist construction. The political task of the congress is to summarize the experience of women's work in the four years since the Second National Women's Congress, and to discuss and determine the tasks of women across the country during the socialist construction period. This congress will undoubtedly play a significant and positive role in promoting the development of socialist construction in our country and the realization of a better future for women and children.
　　Our Party has always cared for and supported the women's liberation movement, regarding women's liberation as one of the important goals of the Party's cause. Under the leadership of the Party, women across the country have experienced more than 30 years of struggle. After the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the basic completion of the socialist revolution, with the establishment of the socialist ownership of the means of production, Chinese women already enjoy equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. They have permanently ended the painful history of being oppressed and enslaved for thousands of years and have achieved women's liberation. This is a great historical fact with epoch-making significance. However, although our country's socialist revolution has achieved basic victory on the economic front (in terms of ownership), the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism on the political and ideological fronts has not yet been completely resolved. The struggle between the people of our country and the bourgeois rightists is still going on fiercely. If socialism does not win on these two fronts, the victories that the people of our country and the women of our country have already achieved in the economic and political fields are not yet solid. Therefore, our Party must lead the people of our country and the women of our country to strive for the complete and thorough victory of this struggle, to ensure the continued development of socialist construction on a solid foundation, and to consolidate the liberation that the people of our country and the women of our country have already obtained. We believe that this congress will guide women across the country to more firmly follow the Communist Party on the road of socialism, enlighten women to better distinguish between right and wrong on the major issues of the two roads of socialism and capitalism, more resolutely fight against the bourgeois rightists, follow the six criteria indicated by Chairman Mao in his report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, transform their old ideas, raise their socialist ideological awareness, pass the socialist test well, and persist in the struggle to win a complete victory for the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.
　　Our country's socialist construction has already achieved great achievements. This year, the people of our country will soon complete and over fulfill the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, laying a preliminary foundation for building a socialist industrial country. In the past few years, the women of our country have displayed a high degree of socialist enthusiasm, working diligently in various production posts and in various tasks of socialist construction, making unprecedented and enormous contributions. They have also played an inestimably great role in household labor and family sideline production.
　　However, in our country, to build a socialist society, it will take another ten to fifteen years of effort from now on. Moreover, because our country's economy and culture are backward and the people's lives are not yet prosperous, to build a socialist society, we must carry forward the revolutionary fine tradition of hard struggle and persistently implement the policy of building the country and managing households through diligence and frugality for a long time. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that Chinese women are a great human resource for building socialism. We must follow this instruction, value the great strength of the women masses, continue to implement the Party's policy of mobilizing both men and women together, and mobilize women across the country to build the country and manage households through diligence and frugality, so that our Party can rely on the strength of the people and women across the country to build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist industrial country. We believe that this congress will make a significant contribution to mobilizing women across the country to build the country and manage households through diligence and frugality.
　　Building the country and managing households through diligence and frugality is the responsibility of all the people of our country, and it is also the responsibility of women across the country. At present, because a large number of women have already participated in various production and construction undertakings, and have been trained to become a huge construction force, the Party committees at all levels in our country, as well as the Party committees in industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, schools, cooperatives, and other aspects, have the responsibility to better educate them, give full play to their socialist enthusiasm, honestly treat labor and collective undertakings, encourage them to study production technology hard, improve their labor skills, pay attention to the quality of labor, abide by labor discipline, and care for their unique difficulties, unite them with all workers and all cooperative members, tap potential from all aspects, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and strive to over fulfill production tasks. Educate women in various positions to deeply study their professions and constantly improve their cultural and scientific level, and contribute more to socialist construction.
　　All women, whether housewives or women participating in social labor, have the responsibility to manage their families well, so women have a particularly important responsibility for implementing the policy of managing households through diligence and frugality. Managing households through diligence and frugality is an important link in implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality, and it is also the foundation for increasing family happiness. Managing a household diligently and frugally can encourage all family members participating in socialist construction to actively engage in labor and production, work hard, and complete the country's plans well, create wealth for the country, increase income for the family, and improve and improve living standards. Managing a household diligently and frugally can also save consumer goods, ease the tight market situation for consumer goods, and save materials for the country. At the same time, careful calculations in family life can put money where it is most needed, increase savings, and prepare for unexpected family needs. Managing a household diligently and frugally can also widely establish a good social atmosphere and lifestyle of diligence and thrift. It can make social groups more friendly and helpful, and make families more united and harmonious. All of this is a huge contribution that women can make to socialist construction, and it is also a huge contribution that can be made to family life. Therefore, we must educate all women to understand the great significance of managing households through diligence and frugality.
　　In the past few years, trade union organizations, women's federations, and resident organizations in various places have generally promoted "Five Goods" (i.e., good at managing households diligently and frugally, good at unity and mutual assistance, good at educating children, good at cleanliness and hygiene, and good at hard study) among housewives of various strata in cities. In rural areas, they are also promoting managing households diligently and frugally, and these efforts have achieved good results. For example, practicing strict economy, careful calculations, and planning family life; cherishing every bit of material from the family, saving food, cotton cloth, water, electricity, coal, etc., and using waste materials to turn useless things into useful materials; developing family sideline production under possible and necessary conditions to increase family income, etc.; these are important aspects of managing households diligently and frugally, and trade union organizations, women's federations, and other relevant units in various places should carefully summarize the experience in this regard and vigorously promote it.
　　Building the country and managing households through diligence and frugality is a long-term and fundamental policy for our country to build socialism, and it is also the basic policy guiding women's work. We must work tirelessly to guide women across the country to realize this policy. We must make women across the country understand that the relationship between socialist countries, socialist collectives, and families and individuals is extremely close. We are not only the masters of the family, but also the masters of the country and the collective. We cannot and should no longer be like in the past private ownership society, "each sweeps the snow from his own door." Now, the prosperity and wealth of every family, and the happiness of individual life, are closely linked with the prosperity and strength of the country and the collective. Things that are beneficial to the country and the collective will definitely be beneficial to the family and the individual; some things may be temporarily beneficial to certain individuals or certain families, but they are detrimental to the country and the collective, then we should also resolutely obey the interests of the country and the collective, and never build the interests and happiness of individual families and individuals on the basis of harming the interests of the country and the collective. This is the normal relationship between socialist countries, collectives, families, and individuals today.
　　The political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party clearly pointed out: "The Party should continue to encourage the enterprising spirit of the women masses, help them overcome some of the unique difficulties in participating in work, help them improve their work skills, correct all erroneous ideas of discrimination against women inside and outside the Party, and pay attention to establishing new moral customs of equality between men and women and protecting women and children in social life and family life. The Democratic Women's Federation, which has established organizations throughout the country, is a mass organization of the broad masses of women. The Party should care about and help its work, and strengthen the Party's connection with the women masses through it." Recently, the Party Central Committee instructed again: In order to solve the problem of managing households diligently and frugally, we must especially rely on women's organizations to do the work. It is hoped that Party committees at all levels will strengthen leadership over women's federations at all levels and various people's organizations and relevant units with women's participation, and urge them to cooperate with each other and do a good job in women's work in accordance with the spirit of the above two instructions.
　　We firmly believe that this congress will fully express the highest aspirations of the broad masses of women in striving for the complete victory of the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, will certainly express the highest aspirations of the broad masses of women to build the country and manage households diligently and frugally and build a socialist country, and will certainly make correct resolutions based on this noble aspiration, making this congress a milestone in the entry of the women's movement into a new stage.
　　We wish the congress a successful conclusion!

    动员全国妇女勤俭建国，勤俭持家
    ——祝中国妇女第三次全国代表大会开幕——
    中国妇女第三次全国代表大会今天在首都开幕，这是我国进入社会主义建设时期之后全国妇女的代表人物第一次大集会。大会的政治任务是总结第二次全国妇女代表大会以来四年多的妇女工作经验，讨论并确定社会主义建设时期全国妇女的任务。这次大会，对促进我国社会主义建设事业的发展和妇女儿童更美好将来的实现，必将起着重大的积极作用。
    我们党一贯关怀和支持妇女解放运动，把妇女解放事业看作党的事业的重要目标之一。在党领导之下，全国妇女经历了三十多年的斗争，在人民民主革命取得胜利和社会主义革命已基本完成，生产资料的社会主义所有制建立起来以后，我国妇女已经在政治上、经济上、文化上、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利，永远结束了几千年被压迫被奴役的惨痛历史，实现了妇女的解放。这是一个具有划时代意义的伟大的历史事实。但是我国社会主义革命虽然已经在经济战线上（在所有制方面）取得了基本胜利，但在政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义同资本主义谁胜谁负的问题，还没有完全解决，我国人民同资产阶级右派之间的斗争还在激烈进行，社会主义如果不在这两条战线上取得胜利，我国人民、我国妇女在经济上、政治上已经取得的胜利还是不巩固的。因此，我们党要领导我国人民、我国妇女努力争取这个斗争的完全的彻底的胜利，以保障社会主义建设在巩固的基础上继续发展，以巩固我国人民、我国妇女已经获得的解放。我们相信这次大会一定会引导全国妇女更加坚定不移地跟共产党走社会主义道路，启发妇女在社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大是大非问题上，更加分清是非，更坚决地同资产阶级右派作斗争，遵循毛主席在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告中指示的六条标准，改造自己的旧思想，提高社会主义思想觉悟，过好社会主义这一关，为争取社会主义革命在政治战线上思想战线上取得完全胜利而坚持奋斗。
    我国社会主义建设事业已经取得了巨大的成就，今年我国人民即将完成并超额完成第一个发展国民经济的五年计划，为建设社会主义工业国打下初步基础。我国妇女在过去几年中，发扬了高度的社会主义积极性，在社会主义建设的各种生产岗位上，各项工作中辛勤劳动，做出了前所未有的巨大贡献，她们在家务劳动和家庭副业生产方面也起了难以估计的巨大作用。
    但是在我们国家，要建成社会主义社会，从现在起，还要经过十年到十五年的努力；而且由于我国经济文化落后，人民生活还不富裕，要建成社会主义社会，必须发扬艰苦奋斗的革命优良传统，长期地坚持地贯彻勤俭建国勤俭持家的方针。毛泽东同志曾经指出中国妇女是建设社会主义的伟大的人力资源，我们一定要遵循这个指示，重视妇女群众的伟大力量，继续贯彻党的男女一齐发动的方针，发动全国妇女勤俭建国勤俭持家，使我们党能依靠全国人民和全国妇女的力量，把我国建成一个繁荣幸福的社会主义工业国。我们相信这次大会一定能在动员全国妇女勤俭建国勤俭持家方面，做出重大的贡献。
    勤俭建国、勤俭持家，是我们全国人民的责任，也是全国妇女的责任。现时由于大量妇女已经参加了各种生产、各项建设事业，已经锻炼成为一支巨大的建设力量，我们全国各级党委、工矿企业、机关、学校、合作社等各方面的党委都有责任更好地教育她们充分发挥社会主义积极性，诚实地对待劳动和集体事业，鼓励她们努力学习生产技术，提高劳动本领，注意劳动质量，遵守劳动纪律，并关怀她们特有的困难，团结她们和全体职工、全体合作社社员一起，从各方面发掘潜力，努力增产，厉行节约，为完成和争取超额完成生产任务而奋斗。教育在各种岗位上的妇女，深入钻研业务，不断提高文化科学水平，为社会主义建设贡献更大的力量。
    全体妇女，不论是家庭主妇或者是参加社会劳动的妇女，都有责任治理好自己的家庭，所以贯彻勤俭持家的方针，妇女们有特别重大的责任。勤俭持家，是贯彻勤俭建国方针的一个重要环节，又是增进家庭幸福的基础。持家而能勤俭，就能鼓励一切参加社会主义建设的家庭成员积极劳动生产，努力工作，很好地完成国家的计划，为国家创造财富，为家庭增加收入，提高和改善生活。持家而能勤俭，又能节约消费资料，和缓市场消费品紧张状况，为国家节约物资。同时在家庭生活上精打细算，就可以把钱用在最需要的地方，增加储蓄，以备家庭不时之需。持家而能勤俭，又能广泛地树立良好的勤劳俭朴的社会风气和生活作风。使社会人群能更友爱互助，使家庭能更团结和睦。这一切都是妇女对社会主义建设可以作出的巨大贡献，又是对家庭生活可以作出的巨大贡献。因此，我们一定要教育全体妇女懂得勤俭持家的伟大意义。
    过去几年中，各地工会组织、妇联组织、居民组织，在城市各阶层家庭妇女中普遍推行“五好”（即勤俭持家好，团结互助好，教养子女好，清洁卫生好，努力学习好），在农村，也正在宣传勤俭持家，这些工作都得到了良好的效果。例如厉行节约，精打细算，计划家庭生活；从家庭里爱惜一点一滴一丝一缕的物资，节约粮食、棉布、水电、煤炭等等，并利用废物，使无用之物变成有用之材；在可能和需要的条件下开展家庭副业生产，增加家庭收入等等；这些都是勤俭持家的重要方面，各地工会组织、妇联组织以及其他各有关单位要很好地总结这方面的经验，大力加以推广。
    勤俭建国、勤俭持家，是我国建设社会主义的长期的根本的方针，也是指导妇女工作的基本方针，我们要为引导全国妇女实现这个方针而不懈地工作。一定要使全国妇女懂得社会主义国家、社会主义集体同家庭、个人的关系是极为密切的。我们不仅是家庭的主人，而且是国家和集体的主人。我们不能也不应该再像在过去私有制社会时候一样，“各人自扫门前雪”。现在每个家庭的兴旺和富裕，个人生活的幸福，都同国家和集体的繁荣和富强紧密联在一起。对国家和对集体有利的事物，对家庭和个人也一定会有利；有些事物可能暂时对某些个人、对某些家庭有利，但对国家、集体不利，那么我们也应该坚决服从国家和集体的利益，决不把个别家庭和个人利益与幸福，建筑在损害国家和集体利益的基础之上。这就是我们今天社会主义国家、集体和家庭、个人的正常关系。
    党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告曾经明确指出：“党应当继续鼓舞妇女群众的上进心。帮助她们克服参加工作的某些特有的困难，帮助她们提高工作的熟练程度，纠正党内外一切歧视妇女的错误思想，并且注意在社会生活和家庭生活中树立男女平等和保护妇女儿童的新的道德风尚。已经在全国各地建立了组织的民主妇女联合会是广大妇女的群众组织，党应当关心和帮助它的工作，通过它来加强党和妇女群众的联系。”最近党中央又指示：为了解决勤俭持家问题，特别要依靠妇女团体做工作。希望各级党委根据上述两个指示的精神，对各级妇联组织，对有妇女参加的各人民团体，各有关单位，加强领导，督促她们相互配合，做好妇女工作。
    我们深信这次大会一定能充分地表达广大妇女群众在政治上思想上争取社会主义革命彻底的完全的胜利的最高愿望，一定能表达广大妇女群众勤俭建国、勤俭持家建设社会主义国家的最高愿望，一定能根据这种崇高的愿望，做出正确的决议，使这次大会成为妇女运动进入新阶段的里程碑。
    预祝大会胜利成功！
