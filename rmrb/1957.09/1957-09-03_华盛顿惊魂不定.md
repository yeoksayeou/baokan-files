Following the TASS announcement of the Soviet Union's successful launch of the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile, pandemonium broke out in several buildings in Washington. Telephones rang incessantly, and high-ranking officials and officers with grim faces hurried back and forth, muttering curses. At this moment, a few individuals, contrary to their usual behavior, enjoyed a period of leisure. These were the spokespersons for the State Department and the Defense Department, who usually speak first, and the White House press officer. While everyone else was extremely nervous, they were ordered to "maintain absolute silence," and therefore had nothing to do. To the batches of news reporters and telephone calls anxiously inquiring, they repeated like robots: "No comment."

In the congressional corridors and newspaper offices, people could not suppress their anxiety. The matter was too serious! There were all sorts of discussions. Some expressed "grave concern" (such as Senator Jackson). Some frantically shouted that "the Russians' progress is unexpected" (another senator). Some, like those walking at night who loudly talk to themselves to embolden themselves, pretended to be calm and said: "There is no reason why any American should be scared out of his wits." ("Daily News") Still others covered their newspapers with trembling fingers and comforted themselves with words like: this news is "doubtful." However, Senator Symington, a former Secretary of the Air Force, clearly knew more about the situation and felt that such "doubt" was a bit risky. He reminded those who were rushing to bury their heads in the sand: "In the past, when they (referring to the Soviet Union) said they had made some achievements in this type of weapon, it later turned out to be true."

After a day of such chaos, the White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon, after a series of emergency consultations, finally agreed on their countermeasures. Acting Secretary of Defense Quarles and Secretary of State Dulles personally came forward to break the official silence. Quarles put on an indifferent air and said that the Soviet announcement was "not surprising." He found an argument for himself: missiles are "not worth" such "attention" because "the so-called missile race's military significance is greatly exaggerated." Dulles showed unprecedented generosity this time. He said, "We have no concrete reason to doubt the truthfulness of (the Soviet) statement." However, Mr. Dulles took his words back, expressing "doubt" about the "accuracy" of the missile launched by the Soviet Union. Probably feeling that this argument was not strong enough, he added two more points: that the Soviet Union's launch of the first intercontinental missile did not mean that it could immediately "mass produce" them, and that regarding the role of missiles, "military authorities have great differences of opinion."

In this way, Quarles and Dulles managed to downplay the role of missiles to insignificance. In the predicament of not being able to produce anything that could rival the intercontinental ballistic missile, this lawyer, accustomed to making big talk, and the heads of the Pentagon had to resort to self-deprecation.

However, people have memories. From the American press, from the talks of Washington's generals and politicians, people have heard enough descriptions of the power of missiles. The so-called "ultimate weapon" is what they came up with to describe the intercontinental ballistic missile. Of course, they came up with this frightening term assuming that the United States would be the sole possessor of this missile.

It would be wrong to say that the United States government has not exhausted its efforts to possess this "ultimate weapon." It has already invested tens of billions of dollars in research and testing alone. In the current fiscal year, the U.S. government has allocated another huge sum of more than $2.6 billion to research and manufacture missiles.

The August issue of the American magazine "Fortune" revealed a plan by the U.S. Department of Defense to develop intercontinental missiles. According to this plan, the Pentagon's strategists dreamed that by 1963, the United States would restore its position in military science and technology to the era when the United States monopolized the atomic bomb, which they called, in their delirium, enjoying a "decisive advantage"!

It can be seen that the White House and the Pentagon had placed great hopes on intercontinental missiles. They had hoped to use this to restore the balance that imperialism had lost and to reinvigorate the deflated policy of strength.

Therefore, even the "New York Times" felt that the official pretense of being strong despite inner weakness was too outrageous. It wrote the day after Quarles and Dulles spoke: "One should not pretend not to see the true enormity of (the Soviet) achievement." The famous American military commentator Baldwin also said that the Soviet announcement should be "taken seriously."

In fact, American strategic planners did not underestimate this matter. At the same time that Dulles and others were making reassuring remarks, the military issued orders to bring out the only intermediate-range missiles that had reached the testing stage to boost morale. Thus, a missile was launched at the missile base in Florida, and the news was announced that same day. The American newspapers and news agencies, as if ordered, immediately dropped the people's talk about Soviet missiles and turned to vigorously promoting American missiles. Although they did not even know what was being launched or what the results of the launch were at the time, they vividly described the power of this thing. Immediately afterwards, Army Secretary Brucker also appeared on stage amidst the sound of gongs and drums. Unlike his top boss Quarles, who played the white-faced role, he played the red-faced role. He described the American missile launch as "a great success" and said that the missile was so powerful that even he "couldn't say."

Washington has really worked hard to boost morale. Unfortunately, the "achievements" of the United States in developing missiles have not been completely kept secret. From the bits and pieces revealed by the American press and news agencies, people have been able to piece together the following situation: the most touted long-range missiles in the United States are the "Thor," "Jupiter," and "Atlas" types. The farthest-range "Atlas" missile was tested two months ago, and as a result, the missile was launched, but it quickly lost control and exploded in flight. The situation for the two intermediate-range missiles, which have a range two-thirds shorter than the intercontinental missile, is not much better. A recently launched "Jupiter" missile caught fire before reaching its target. Three "Thor" missiles have been test-fired one after another. The first one exploded before it took off, causing a major chaos at the test site. The second one malfunctioned as soon as it took off and exploded in the air. Regarding the launch of the third one, an eyewitness gave a vivid description: "As soon as it took to the air, it began to turn, looking like it was going to make a big circle and might return to the mainland." So it had to be detonated immediately.

Washington's incoherent and contradictory situation can be described as a state of panic, and this should not be considered excessive.

    华盛顿惊魂不定
    胡平
  塔斯社发表苏联发射了世界上第一枚洲际弹道火箭成功的声明之后，华盛顿的几个大厦里立刻哄动起来了。电话铃响个不停，脸色难看的高级官员和军官们匆匆忙忙地穿来穿去，嘴里咒骂着一些什么。这时候，有这样几个人倒一反常例，清闲了一阵。他们是通常最先讲话的国务院和国防部的发言人，还有白宫的新闻发布官。在大家紧张得要命的时候，他们却奉命“保持绝顶的缄默”，因此无事可作。对着一批一批的焦急地发出询问的新闻记者和电话，他们像机器人一样重复这么一句话：“没有意见发表。”
    在议会走廊上和报馆里，人们却按捺不住焦急的心情。事情太严重了！各式各样的议论都有。有人表示“严重的忧虑”（如参议员杰克逊）。有人张皇地叫喊“俄国人的进步是意想不到的”（另一议员）。有一些人像走夜路者高声自言自语为自己壮胆一样，故作镇静地说：“没有什么理由应当把任何美国人吓得魂不附体。”（“每日新闻”）还有人用颤抖的手指掩住报纸，用这样的话来安慰自己：这个消息“值得怀疑”。但是，当过空军部长的参议员薛明顿显然对内情了解得要多一些，觉得这样“怀疑”未免有点儿冒险。他提醒那些急忙把头埋在沙里的人们：“在过去，当他们（指苏联）说他们对于这类武器有了一些成就的时候，后来发现果然是事实。”
    这样乱哄哄地过了一天，白宫、国务院和五角大楼经过一系列紧急磋商，总算商定了他们的对策。代理国防部长卡利斯和国务卿杜勒斯亲自出马来打破官方的沉寂。卡利斯摆出一副若无其事的神气说：苏联的宣布“并不惊人”。他为自己找了一个论据：导弹这东西并“不值得”这样受“重视”，因为“所谓导弹竞争在当前的军事意义被大大地夸张了”。杜勒斯这一次表现得空前大方。他说：“我们没有什么具体的理由来怀疑（苏联）声明的真实性。”不过，杜勒斯先生又把话说回来，他表示“怀疑”苏联发射的导弹的“准确程度”。大概是感到这个论点太不够有力，他又作了两点补充：苏联发射了第一枚洲际导弹，并不意味着它马上可以“大规模生产”，而且，关于导弹这东西的作用，“军事权威方面很有分歧”。
    这样一来，卡利斯和杜勒斯算是把导弹的作用贬低到无足轻重。在拿不出任何可以同洲际弹道导弹相颉颃的东西的窘境里，惯于说大话的这位律师和五角大楼的头儿们只得求助于自我解嘲了。
    可是，人们是有记忆力的。从美国报刊上，从华盛顿的将军、政客们的谈话里，人们听到过足够多的关于导弹的威力的形容和描写。所谓“最后的武器”，就是他们想出来用以形容洲际弹道导弹的。当然，他们想出这种吓人的名辞来的时候是假定美国将是这种导弹的唯一拥有者的。
    要说美国政府没有竭尽努力想拥有这种“最后的武器”，那是冤枉了它的。仅仅为了研究、试验，它已经在这方面投进了好几十亿的美元。在目前这一年度中，美国政府又拨出了二十六亿多美元的巨款来研究和制造导弹。
    今年8月号的美国“幸福”杂志曾经透露了美国国防部的一个发展洲际导弹的计划。根据这个计划，五角大楼的战略家们梦想到1963年时，美国在军事科学技术方面，将恢复到美国垄断原子弹时代的地位，用他们的梦呓是叫作享有“决定性的优势”！
    可见白宫和五角大楼对洲际导弹是着实寄托了希望的。它们曾希望有这个东西来恢复帝国主义已经失去了的平衡，给瘪了的实力地位政策重新打气。
    因此，官方这种打肿脸充胖子的作法，连“纽约时报”也觉得太不像话。它在卡利斯和杜勒斯发言后的第二天写道：“不应当装作看不见（苏联）这一成就的真正的巨大性。”著名的美国军事评论员鲍德温也说：对苏联的宣布应该“严重地看待”。
    实在说来；美国的战略策划人并没有小看这件事情。在杜勒斯等人发表安定人心的谈话同时，军部就下了命令，把仅有的已经达到试验阶段的中程导弹拿出来壮壮声势。于是，在佛罗里达州的导弹基地就发射了一枚导弹，并且当天就把消息公布出去。美国的报纸、通讯社也像得了命令一样，立即扔下了人们关于苏联导弹的谈论，转而大吹起美国的导弹来。尽管它们当时连发射的是什么东西以及发射的结果如何都弄不清楚，但关于这个东西的威力却描绘得活神活现。紧接着，陆军部长布鲁克也在锣鼓声中出台亮场。同他的唱白脸的顶头上司卡利斯不同，他唱的是红脸。他把美国这回发射导弹说成是“一个伟大的成功”，并说这个导弹威力之大，甚至连他也“说不上来”。
    为了鼓舞士气，华盛顿也真够下苦心的了。可惜的是，关于美国在发展导弹方面的“成就”，并没有完全保得住秘密。从美国报刊和通讯社透露出来的点点滴滴，人们已经能够拼凑起这样一些情况：美国吹得最多的长距离导弹有“雷神”式、“丘辟特”式和“阿特拉斯”式三种。最远距离的“阿特拉斯”式导弹，两个月以前曾进行试验，结果弹是射出去了，但是很快就失去控制，在飞行中就爆炸了。射程比洲际导弹短三分之二以上的那两种中程导弹，情况也好不了多少。最近发射的一颗“丘辟特”式导弹，在没有抵达目标以前起火了。“雷神”式导弹已经先后试射了三枚。第一枚还未起飞就爆炸，在试验场引起了一场大混乱。第二枚刚刚起飞，机件失灵，在空中爆炸了。关于第三枚的发射情况，目击者有一段生动的描写：“刚腾入空中，就开始转弯，看样子像要转一个大圈，可能会回到大陆上来”。于是只得立即使它爆炸。
    华盛顿这种颠三倒四、语无伦次的情况，称之为惊魂不定，应该不算是过份吧。
