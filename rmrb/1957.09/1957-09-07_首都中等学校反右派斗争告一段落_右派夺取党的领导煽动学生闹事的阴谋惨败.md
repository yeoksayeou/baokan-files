The anti-Rightist struggle in Beijing's secondary schools has achieved preliminary victory. Currently, among the 134 secondary schools in Beijing (including secondary normal schools, worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools, and spare-time secondary schools), 182 Rightist elements have been exposed or revealed and criticized by the masses. Among these Rightist elements, members of democratic parties such as the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), the China Democratic League (CDL), and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) account for 17%, with CAPD members being the most numerous, totaling 21, and many holding positions as heads of grassroots CAPD organizations.

One of the characteristics of these Rightist elements' attack on the Party is their attempt to use democratic party organizations as a base to confront the Party and even replace it. Zong Jiarui, a Rightist element who was a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and the director of the CAPD branch of the Beijing Normal University Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School, disregarded the decision to postpone rectification in primary and secondary schools during the "blooming and contending" period, and stirred up trouble everywhere in the school, inciting the masses to attack the Party. He said, "This time we have to make a big effort, expose all the problems, and uncover their (referring to the Party) secrets." He also said, "It's okay if there are no Party members in the school, but the school will collapse without CAPD." He clamored "to use the organization (CAPD) to confront the organization" and even secretly arranged the school's leadership personnel, attempting to replace the Party. Rightist elements Liu Qingshou (deputy chairman of the CAPD branch), Liu Shengshi, and Li Mubai (organization and propaganda committee members of the CAPD branch) of the Fifth Middle School formed a small clique to confront the school's Party organization. Liu Qingshou said, "The Party cannot represent the interests of intellectuals; only CAPD represents the interests of intellectuals." Liu Shengshi said, "In the future, don't consult with the Party branch about anything."

Some Rightist elements proposed the implementation of a "school affairs committee system" in secondary schools, attempting to exclude the leadership of the Party. Wu Ninghui, a Rightist element from the 28th Middle School, said, "The task of the school affairs committee is to decide on the school's work plan, personnel allocation, and other major issues."

These Rightist elements also spread reactionary remarks among young students, inciting students to cause trouble. He Yejian, a Rightist element from the 32nd Middle School, said that "the socialist system is not good," in response to the fact that not all junior high school graduates could advance to higher education, and incited students to make trouble. Zhang Dezhi, a Rightist element from the 51st Middle School, said to the students, "If you can't get into school, go to the Education Bureau and make trouble, stand there and don't leave, and see what they do."

The anti-Rightist struggle in Beijing's secondary schools began in early July. Through this stage of the anti-Rightist struggle, Rightist elements have become isolated. Currently, the anti-Rightist struggle in Beijing's secondary schools has come to a preliminary end. After the start of the new semester, Beijing's secondary schools will conduct a comprehensive and in-depth rectification campaign.

    首都中等学校反右派斗争告一段落
    右派夺取党的领导煽动学生闹事的阴谋惨败
    本报讯　北京市中学的反右派斗争已获得初步胜利，目前一百三十四所中学（包括中等师范学校、工农速成中学、业余中学）中，已经暴露或经过群众揭露批判的右派分子有一百八十二人。在这些右派分子当中，民进、民盟、农工等民主党派的成员占17％，其中又以民进会员为最多，有二十一人，并且许多人是民进基层组织的负责人。
    这些右派分子向党进攻的特点之一，是要以民主党派组织作为基地，企图与党分庭抗礼甚至取而代之。身为中国民主促进会北京市委员会委员、北京师范大学工农速成中学民进支部主任委员的右派分子宗家瑞，在鸣放期间，不顾中小学暂不整风的决定，在学校里到处放火，煽动群众向党进攻。他说：“这次我们要大干一下，把什么问题都兜出来，非揭他们（指党）的盖子不可。”又说：“学校里没有党员可以，没有民进就要垮台。”扬言“要以组织（民进）对抗组织”，他甚至把学校的领导人员都暗地里作了安排，企图取党而代之。第五中学右派分子刘庆寿（民进支部副主委）、刘圣时、李慕白（民进支部组织、宣传委员）则结成小集团，同学校党组织对抗。刘庆寿说：“党不能代表知识分子的利益，只有民进代表知识分子的利益。”刘圣时则说：“以后有事情不要找党支部商量。”
    有的右派分子则提出中学里应实行“校务会议制”，企图排斥党的领导。二十八中右派分子巫宁慧就说：“校务会议的任务是决定学校的工作计划、人事调配等重大问题。”
    这些右派分子还在青年学生当中散布反动言论，煽动学生闹事。三十二中右派分子何叶健针对初三毕业生不能全部升学的情况，说“社会主义制度不好”，鼓动学生闹事。五十一中右派分子张德智对学生说：“你们考不上学就到教育局去闹，站在那里不走，看他们怎么办。”
    北京各中学的反右派的斗争是从7月初开始的。经过这一阶段反右派斗争，右派分子已陷于孤立。目前，北京各中学反右派的斗争暂告一个段落。开学之后，北京市中等学校将全面深入进行整风。
