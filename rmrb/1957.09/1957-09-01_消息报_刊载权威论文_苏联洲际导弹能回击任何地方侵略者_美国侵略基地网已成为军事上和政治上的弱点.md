    “Izvestia” Publishes Authoritative Article
    Soviet Intercontinental Missiles Can Repel Aggressors Anywhere
    U.S. Aggression Base Network Has Become a Military and Political Weakness
    (Our newspaper, Moscow, 31st) The successful Soviet test of an intercontinental missile demonstrates the enormous achievements that science and technology can attain in socialist countries. This is the argument made by Professor Pokrovsky in an article published in today's "Izvestia" regarding intercontinental missiles. He is a Major General Engineer and Doctor of Technology. He said: No matter what the reactionary newspapers of capitalist countries write, the Soviet military strength, however powerful, is a factor in resisting aggression and safeguarding peace. His article discussed the advantages of intercontinental missiles. He said: Ordinary long-range rockets cannot exceed the scope of a continent and cannot fly across the ocean. The United States believed that in the event of a war in Europe and Asia, the Americas would not be subject to rocket attacks. The United States has established a network of military bases in Europe and Asia, intending to use air force and rockets to strike any country in wartime, while U.S. territory would not be affected by rockets. The emergence of intercontinental missiles has fundamentally changed this situation. Now, any aggressor anywhere on the globe can no longer escape the retaliation of rockets, which can carry powerful nuclear weapons and strike the target unexpectedly and accurately. The U.S. military base network has lost its former significance, and the troops and equipment distributed in these bases are ultimately not strongholds of military and political power, but instead have become weaknesses militarily and politically.
    Pokrovsky said: Intercontinental missiles should have an initial velocity of five to seven kilometers per second. This speed cannot be obtained by ordinary methods, and even atomic energy engines cannot help. The Soviet Union has realized the multi-stage rocket idea of the Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky more than fifty years ago. Intercontinental missiles carry several engines and fuel and oxidizer. When a batch of fuel and oxidizer is used up, an engine is discarded, and the remaining engines accelerate forward. Although intercontinental missiles are structurally complex, they are accurate in their trajectory. The deviation to the target is only ten to twenty kilometers. This is within the range of powerful nuclear explosions. Intercontinental missiles can be launched from small sites, which are different from airports, can be repaired faster, and are easy to camouflage, so they are actually difficult to destroy. Intercontinental missiles fly very fast, flying to an altitude of several hundred kilometers, and no aircraft or modern air defense tools can shoot them down. Even radio-controlled aircraft are far from comparable to intercontinental missiles.

    “消息报”刊载权威论文
    苏联洲际导弹能回击任何地方侵略者
    美国侵略基地网已成为军事上和政治上的弱点
    本报莫斯科31日电  苏联试验洲际导弹成功，说明在社会主义国家里科学和技术能够达到多么巨大的成果。这是波克罗夫斯基教授在今天“消息报”上发表的关于洲际导弹的文章中的论点。他是少将工程师、技术博士。他说：不管资本主义国家的反动报纸怎么写，苏联军事力量无论怎么强大都是反抗侵略和维护和平的因素。他的文章中谈了洲际导弹的优越性。他说：普通的远程火箭不能超出一个洲的范围，不能飞过大洋。美国以为一旦在欧亚战争时，美洲不受火箭的攻击。美国在欧亚建立了军事基地网，想在战争时以空军和火箭打击任何国家，而美国领土不受火箭的影响。洲际导弹的出现，根本改变了这种形势。现在全地球上任何地方的任何一个侵略者已经躲不开火箭的回击，这些火箭能带强大的核子武器，出其不意和准确地射到目的地。美国的军事基地网失掉从前的意义，分布在这些基地上的军队和军备终于不成为军事和政治的力量据点，反而在军事上和政治上成为弱点。
    波克罗夫斯基说：洲际导弹应有一秒钟五至七公里的初速。用普通方法得不到这样速度，甚至原子能发动机也不能帮助。苏联运用俄国科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基五十多年前的多层火箭思想实现了。洲际导弹带着几部发动机和燃料与氧化剂。一批燃料和氧化剂用尽时，抛掉一部发动机，靠其余发动机加速前进。洲际导弹虽然结构复杂，但射向准确。到目标时偏差不过一二十公里。这在强大的核子爆炸的威力范围。洲际导弹可以从不大的场子射出，这种场子不同于飞机场，可以较快修好并且容易伪装，所以实际上难以破坏。洲际导弹飞得非常快，飞到几百公里高空，任何飞机和现代化的防空工具都不能击掉它。连用无线电操纵的飞机也远不能与洲际导弹比拟。
