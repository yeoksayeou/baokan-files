Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Since the Economic Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched the struggle against Sun Yutang's right-wing clique on June 26, it has held 23 debates of various sizes to date. His anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiratorial activities have been exposed.

Sun Yutang was a supporter and disseminator of the scientific program of the Zhang-Luo alliance. He participated in the symposium for formulating this program, actively offering advice and selling it everywhere. His central aim was to exclude Marxism-Leninism from the field of social sciences and to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party. Sun Yutang strongly agreed with Fei Xiaotong's platitudes of restoring bourgeois sociology and relying on bourgeois social scientists. He believed that "now it is no longer a matter of dealing with it, but a fundamental change in the situation."

In order to weaken the Communist Party's leadership in the Economic Institute, he cooperated with outside right-wing elements to put forward the slogan of "scientists running science." He believed that the Communist Party could lead ideological education, but not science, and that party-member scientists were also incompetent as leaders. Sun Yutang's accomplice, Zhang Youyi, put forward a specific proposal: "Researchers (including associate researchers) should take turns as directors of the institute." According to their own confession: Among the personnel above the associate researcher level in the Economic Institute, there are very few party members. If their proposal could be implemented, it could "weaken part of the Party's leadership."

Sun Yutang, under the pretext of opposing bureaucracy, attacked the socialist system, saying that he was truly "in his element" and "stood tall" when he was at the old Tsinghua University and Oxford University in England. "No one above came to put pressure, and no one below oppressed the teaching assistants and students," but today above him were "layers of pavilions and terraces," and "administration is above academic life, which oppresses academic life to the point where I have asthma and can't breathe." He arrogantly proposed that academic research does not need planning, saying that the Academy of Sciences' "Twelve-Year Plan is top-down" and impractical, and that "planning inspection is actually interference."

Sun Yutang fabricated rumors and used double-dealing tactics to sow discord between the masses and the Communist Party. He fabricated some "facts," saying that "the Party underestimates the knowledge accumulation of old intellectuals" and that the use of intellectuals is "simply disguised labor reform." He slandered the Party for not caring about young people, saying in front of the Party branch that "young people do not obey leadership," and saying in front of young people that "the Party is not responsible for the training of young people," and that only he was a sympathizer with intellectuals.

Sun Yutang was a researcher at the Economic Institute, chairman of the trade union, and organization member of the China Democratic League's branch at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This rightist's rampant anti-communism and anti-socialism have historical roots. Sun Yutang was originally a comprador politician. After 1939, he served successively as the editor of "Contemporary Review" (funded by the secret agent leader Zhu Jiahua) and the "History" supplement of the Kunming pseudo-Central Daily News. In 1943, he officially joined the Kuomintang in Kunming. In 1944, he served as an instructor in the translator training class held by the Kuomintang for the US military (political training work was managed by secret agent leaders such as Chen Xueping and Cai Weifan). In 1944 and 1948, he published the article "The Development of the Chinese Nation" twice, finding "theoretical" basis for Chiang Kai-shek's national chauvinism in "China's Destiny." In 1947, he acted as a special assistant in the Kuomintang's delegation to the United Nations, acting as an "accomplice" to the Kuomintang's betrayal of the country. On the eve of liberation, he also prettified the aggressive behavior of US imperialism and advised Chiang Kai-shek's dying rule at the "Sino-US Relations" symposium held by the "New Road" weekly. Sun Yutang had an unusually close relationship with right-wing leaders Luo Longji, right-wing core members Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, and Pan Guangdan long before liberation. Therefore, not long after liberation, Sun Yutang sneaked into the China Democratic League, transformed himself into a "progressive scholar," and boasted everywhere, deceiving the people's trust.

### 过去媚美拥蒋  现在反对共产党  孙毓棠原来是个洋奴政客

　　过去媚美拥蒋  现在反对共产党
    孙毓棠原来是个洋奴政客
    据新华社12日讯  中国科学院经济研究所，从6月26日展开对孙毓棠右派小集团的斗争以来，截至目前为止，已举行了大小辩论会二十三次。他的反共反社会主义的阴谋活动，已经败露。
    孙毓棠是章罗联盟科学纲领的拥护者和传布者。他曾参加了制定这个纲领的座谈会，积极地出谋献策，并到处叫卖。他的中心目的是在社会科学领域排斥马列主义，取消共产党的领导。孙毓棠非常同意费孝通恢复资产阶级社会学和依靠资产阶级社会科学家的滥调。他认为“现在已不是对付一下的问题，而是应该从根本上改变局面”。
    他为了削弱共产党在经济所的领导，他和外面右派分子相配合，提出所谓“科学家办科学”的口号。他认为，共产党可以领导思想教育，不能领导科学，党员科学家也不堪作领导。孙毓棠的同谋者章有义就提出一个具体主张：“研究员（包括副研究员）轮流当所长”。据他们自己交代说：经济所副研究员以上的人员中，党员极少，如果他们这个主张能实行的话，就可以“削弱一部分党的领导”。
    孙毓棠借口反官僚主义，大肆攻击社会主义制度，他说他过去在旧清华和英国牛津大学时，真是“如鱼得水”，“顶天立地”，“上面没有人来压，下面也不压助教学生”，而今天在他的头上，却是“一层层的楼阁亭台”，“行政在学术生活之上，把学术生活压得像我犯了气喘病一样喘不过气来”。他狂妄地提出学术不要计划，说甚么科学院“十二年规划是自上而下来的”，不切实际，有了“计划检查，实际就是干扰。”
    孙毓棠造谣生事，利用两面派的手法挑拨群众同共产党等方面的关系。他捏造了一些“事实”，说“党对旧知识分子的知识积累估计不足”，对知识分子的使用“简直是变相的劳动改造”。他诬蔑党不关心青年，在党支部面前说“青年人不服从领导”，在青年面前说“党对青年的培养不负责任”，只有他是知识分子的同情者。
    孙毓棠是经济研究所的研究员、工会主席、民盟中国科学院支部组织委员。这个右派分子之所以如此猖狂地反共反社会主义是有其历史根源的。孙毓棠原来是一个洋奴政客。1939年后，他先后做了“当代评论”（由特务头子朱家骅出钱主办）和昆明伪中央日报的“史学”副刊的编辑；1943年在昆明正式参加国民党；1944年在国民党为美军举办的译员训练班（政治训练工作由陈雪屏、蔡维藩等特务头子主管）中，他担任教官；1944、1948年两度发表的“中国民族的发展”一文为蒋介石“中国之命运”中的民族沙文主义找“理论”根据。1947年在国民党的联合国代表团中充当专门助理，作了国民党卖国的“帮凶”。在解放前夕，他还在“新路”周刊举行的“中美关系”座谈会上，为美帝国主义的侵略行为涂脂抹粉，为蒋介石的垂死统治出谋献策。孙毓棠同右派头子罗隆基，右派骨干分子费孝通、吴景超、潘光旦等，远在解放前，就有着一种异乎寻常的亲密关系。因此，解放后不久，孙毓棠即混进民盟，摇身一变而成为一个“进步学者”，并到处吹嘘，骗取人民的信任。
