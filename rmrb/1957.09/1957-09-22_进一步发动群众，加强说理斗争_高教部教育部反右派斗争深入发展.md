    Further Mobilize the Masses, Strengthen Argumentative Struggle
    The Anti-Rightist Struggle Deepens in the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education

    (Our Dispatch) In the anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Higher Education, the ugly and reactionary faces of the Rightists have been exposed, and argumentative struggle has been launched. Now the anti-Rightist struggle is developing in depth.

    Rightist elements in the Ministry of Higher Education madly attacked the Party's leadership over higher education. Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of Higher Education and a core member of the Zhang-Luo anti-Party clique, attacked and negated the Party's leadership over higher education. He slandered that the work of the Ministry of Higher Education was unpopular, that "personnel work in higher education institutions is the target of public criticism," and that the leadership was incompetent. He said that people were unwilling to voice their opinions before, but now they would. He negated the adjustment of departments and teaching reforms, believing that the achievements were small and the shortcomings and errors were many, and that the adjustment of departments was "a mess." Under the guise of opposing dogmatism, he denied the correctness of learning from the Soviet Union.

    Echoing Zeng Zhaolun's attack were the activities of Rightist elements within the Party. The eighth issue of the Ministry of Higher Education's journal "Higher Education" contained serious political errors. In this issue, the bourgeois educational orientation was promoted, the Party's leadership and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism were attacked, the achievements of higher education work since liberation were negated, and learning from the Soviet Union was negated. Sun Yunren, Deputy Director of the Teaching Guidance Department and a member of the Communist Party, the author of the commentary, and Guo Hongsheng, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of "Higher Education" and a member of the Communist Party, who edited the report, sang in harmony with the Rightists outside the Party, praising the Rightists' opinions as "correct" and "well-intentioned," and issuing a call to "improve consciousness and strive for initiative" to the leading comrades of higher education. They shouted that "it is dangerous for Party members to take care of everything!" and that it was "not a genuine mass line, but a Party member line." They said that the main contradiction in schools was not the contradiction between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, but that "poor Party-masses relations is the main contradiction." They negated the achievements of higher education, and said that leaders at all levels of higher education were "mainly busy with responding to the arrangements of the higher authorities, as if they were mainly serving the higher authorities, rather than serving the broad masses of teachers and scientific research," in order to sow discord between those inside and outside the Party, and between higher and lower levels.

    Other Rightist elements within the Ministry of Higher Education echoed the Rightist bosses outside the ministry, generally concentrating on the Party's leadership, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and cadre policies. Gao Erbai, a researcher in the Science and Research Department, Dai Xiaohou, Deputy Director of the Fourth Editorial Office of the Higher Education Publishing House, and Pi Xiaotao, an editor of the Fourth Editorial Office of the Higher Education Publishing House, all launched vicious attacks on the Party. Gao Erbai said that the distance between the people and the Party and the government was great, mainly as a result of several political movements. He particularly slandered the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Rightist element Dai Xiaohou openly opposed public-private partnerships and the socialist transformation policy. He slandered the partnerships as a "trick" to "eliminate" them. Pi Xiaotao was a confidant of the Rightist element Gu Zhizhong. He accepted Gu's instructions to portray the Higher Education Publishing House as a dark little kingdom, inciting those who were investigated in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries to write materials to slander the movement.

    In order to counterattack the Rightist elements, the ministry has held many criticism meetings to criticize Zeng Zhaolun's various fallacies.

    On September 6, 12, 19, and 20, the Ministry of Higher Education held four debate meetings for all staff members to criticize the political errors in the eighth issue of "Higher Education." At the meeting, the ideological essence of Sun Yunren and Guo Hongsheng was further exposed. Sun Yunren usually said: "The ideological and professional level of the leaders of higher education is problematic," emphasizing that in teaching, "there is no difference between capitalist things and socialist things," and appreciating the slogan of "democratic school management." Guo Hongsheng had always been dissatisfied with the Party and opposed to the Party. He often said, "People are bullied if they are kind, and horses are ridden if they are good." In the early stages of the rectification campaign, he incited some people to raise opinions on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, saying that "the more sharp, the better."

    (Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Education further mobilized the masses, strengthened argumentative struggle, improved leadership thinking and leadership style, and the anti-Rightist struggle is unfolding more widely and deeply.

    The anti-Rightist struggle in various units of the Ministry of Education has gradually deepened since the end of June. This period of struggle has achieved significant results. A number of Rightist elements have been exposed in various units. The reactionary remarks spread by these Rightist elements attacked Marxism-Leninism, the Party's leadership, and the socialist system in a concentrated manner from many specific issues. For example, Zhang Jiyu (专员兼科长/Specialist and Section Chief of the Ethnic Education Department), an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, distorted and exaggerated facts at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, providing Zhang and Luo with more than ten "materials" for attacking the Party; at the beginning of the rectification campaign, he "wanted to mobilize cadres and teachers inside and outside the ministry to talk openly and let it rip," "blowing the wind from level two to level eight"; he said that "the work of the Ministry of Education is a mess," "it won't last past this summer vacation"; he attacked the Party member ministers of the Ministry of Education, saying, "If you can't do it, step down yourself"; he negated the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; he praised Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world," saying, "That's actually how it is"; he also sowed discord between the Party and the masses, saying that "non-Party cadres are excluded," "non-Party cadres cannot contact the Party committee organs for work," and scolded cadres who actively strived to join the Party, etc. Rightist element Liu Shuzhen (editor of the People's Education Publishing House) slandered that there had been no achievements in the national general education cause in recent years, that "achievements are not the main thing," but "a mess." Rightist element Jia Yuan (staff member of the Workers' and Peasants' Education Bureau) slandered, "The world belongs to the Party, and you will be rewarded as much as they want." Rightist element Xu Tiema (editor of the Teachers' Newspaper) wantonly insulted and slandered the Party, attacking the Party organization and Party members of the Teachers' Newspaper, saying that the Teachers' Newspaper served the "three major -isms." He also encouraged those who had been struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to rise up and attack. Rightist elements Xu Tuozhi (Director of the Chinese Language Department of the Beijing Correspondence Normal School) and Zhang Qixiang (staff member of the Chinese Language Department) formed an alliance, attempting to bring down the school's Party branch, overthrow the school's leadership, use big-character posters to stir up trouble, and attack the Party, threatening that if the higher authorities did not remove the school's Party and administrative leaders, they would organize the school's teachers to sign a petition refusing to work. They incited those dissatisfied with the Party to rise up and settle old scores in the rectification campaign.

    During this period, various units are criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of nineteen Rightist elements. The Rightist elements who have basically concluded or brought their struggles to a temporary end have been completely or basically isolated. All staff members have been tempered in the struggle, and their level of awareness has been raised to varying degrees.

    进一步发动群众，加强说理斗争
    高教部教育部反右派斗争深入发展
    本报讯　高等教育部反右派斗争中，揭发了右派分子丑恶的反动面貌，展开了说理斗争，现在反右派斗争正在向深入发展。
    高等教育部右派分子疯狂攻击党对高等教育事业的领导。章罗反动集团核心骨干分子高教部副部长曾昭抡，攻击和否定党对高教事业的领导。诬蔑高教部工作不得人心，“高等学校人事工作是众矢之的”，领导外行。有意见不愿讲，现在要讲了。他否定院系调整和教学改革，认为成绩不大缺点错误很多，院系调整是“乱点鸳鸯谱”。在反对教条主义的伪装下，否认学习苏联方针的正确。
    与曾昭抡的进攻相呼应的是党内右派分子的活动。高教部机关刊物“高等教育”第八期出现了严重的政治性错误，在这一期中宣扬资产阶级教育方向，攻击党的领导和马列主义思想指导，否定解放后高等教育工作的成绩，否定学习苏联。评论作者教学指导司副司长、中共党员孙运仁和报道编者“高等教育”副总编辑、中共党员郭蕻生，与党外右派一吹一唱，称颂右派的意见是“正确的”，“善意的”，“并且向高等教育领导同志发出“提高自觉、争取主动”的劝降号召。叫喊“党员包办一切是危险的！”“不是真正群众路线，而是党员路线”，说什么学校的主要矛盾不是无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的矛盾，而“党群关系不好是主要矛盾”，他们否定高教的成绩，并且说高教各级领导“主要忙于应付上级的布置，好像主要是为上级服务，而不是为广大教师和科学研究服务”，以挑拨党内外、上下级的关系。
    高教部内其他右派分子对党的攻击同部外右派头子呼应，也一般集中在党的领导、肃反运动、干部政策几方面。科学研究司研究员高尔柏，高教出版社第四编辑室副主任戴孝侯和高教出版社第四编辑室编辑皮筱韬都向党发动了凶恶的进攻。高尔柏说，人民和党、政府的距离很大，主要原因是几次政治运动的结果。他特别诬蔑肃反运动。右派分子戴孝侯公开反对公私合营，反对社会主义改造政策。他诬蔑合营是“消灭”诡计，皮筱韬是右派分子顾执中的心腹，他接受了顾的指示，把高等教育出版社描绘成黑暗的小王国，煽动肃反中被审查的人写材料诬蔑肃反运动。
    为了对右派分子展开反击，部内曾开了多次批判大会，对曾昭抡的各种谬论进行批判。
    9月6日、12日、19日、20日高教部召开了四次全部工作人员辩论大会，批判“高等教育”第八期的政治性错误。会上进一步揭发了孙运仁和郭蕻生的思想本质。孙运仁平时即说：“高教领导的思想、业务水平有问题”，强调在教学中“资本主义的东西和社会主义的东西没有区别”，欣赏“民主办校”的口号。郭蕻生平日对党一贯不满，与党对立，常说“人善有人欺，马善有人骑”。鸣放初期煽动一些人对肃反提意见，说“越尖锐越好”。
    本报讯　教育部进一步发动群众，加强说理斗争，改进领导思想和领导作风，反右派斗争正更广泛而深入地展开。
    教育部各单位的反右派斗争，从6月底开始，逐步深入。这一时期的斗争，获得显著的成绩。各单位已揭发出一批右派分子。这些右派分子所散布的反动言论，从很多具体问题上，集中的向马列主义，向党的领导和社会主义制度进攻。如民盟中央候补委员张纪域（民族教育司专员兼科长）他在民盟中央常委会扩大会议上歪曲和夸大事实，向章、罗提供向党进攻的“材料”十余条；他在整风开始“要发动部内外干部与教师敞开来谈，大鸣大放”，“把风从二级吹到八级”；他说“教育部工作一团糟”，“过不了今年暑假”；他攻击教育部党员部长说，“干不了就自己下台”；他否定肃反成绩；他赞扬储安平“党天下”谬论，“实际就是这样”；他还挑拨离间党群关系，说“非党干部受排斥”，“非党干部不能和党委机关联系工作”，辱骂积极争取入党的干部，等等，右派分子刘淑珍（人民教育出版社编辑）诬蔑说，几年来全国普通教育事业没有什么成绩，“成绩不是主要的，”是“一团糟”。右派分子贾援（工农教育局科员）诬蔑“天下是党的，赏赐你多少就多少”。右派分子许铁马（教师报社编辑），大肆谩骂和诬蔑党，攻击教师报的党组织和党员，说教师报是为“三大主义”服务的。他还鼓励肃反中被斗争过的起来进攻。右派分子徐拓之（北京函授师范学校语文科主任）章启祥（语文科科员）结成联盟，企图搞垮学校的党支部，推翻学校的领导，利用大字报煽风点火，向党进攻，扬言上级如不撤掉学校党和行政的领导人，就组织学校教员都签名不干。他们煽动对党不满的人，在整风中起来算旧账。
    在这一期间，各单位正对十九名右派分子的反动言行进行批判。经过斗争基本结束或者告一段落的右派分子已完全或者基本上陷于孤立。全体工作人员在斗争中受到了锻炼，觉悟程度有了不同程度的提高。
