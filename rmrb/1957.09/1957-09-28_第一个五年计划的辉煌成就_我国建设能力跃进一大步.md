Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Lin reports: According to the latest materials provided by the State Construction Commission, the State Planning Commission, the State Technological Commission, and the State Statistical Bureau, the extremely backward state of industrial technology in China has been changed, and the contradiction between the level of industrial technology and the tasks of basic construction encountered at the beginning of the Five-Year Plan will be basically resolved. This is a huge achievement made in the implementation of China's First Five-Year Plan, and also the result of the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries.

Geological Exploration Has Taken the Lead
The geological exploration work to provide resource conditions for heavy industry construction has established its own strong team. There are more than 26,000 engineering and technical personnel alone, and more than 4,000 various drilling rigs. Geological work used to be the most backward department in China. From 1907 to before liberation, the total number of engineering and technical personnel was less than 200, and the number of drilling rigs was less than 100, and most of them were old and unusable. The total footage of drilling was less than 150,000 meters. In the past five years, this new force of China has spread its footprints all over the motherland, from the Central Plains to the borderlands, from the Qaidam Basin to the Kangzang Plateau. The footage of drilling alone has exceeded 80 times the cumulative figure before liberation. They climbed mountains and crossed ridges, camping in the open and eating in the wind, and found about 50 kinds of minerals for China, so that the resource problems of the First Five-Year Plan and the Second Five-Year Plan can be basically solved.

Many Factories and Mines Can Be Designed Independently
China can basically rely on its own strength to carry out factory and mine design. The situation of relying on foreign design for construction during the First Five-Year Plan can now be changed. Among the projects built during the First Five-Year Plan, although most of the projects were designed by China itself, the "156" projects, which are the backbone of China's industry, and some other projects above the limited amount relied on the assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries. At present, China can basically design modern, medium-sized and some large-scale metallurgical, coal, petroleum, electric power, machinery, textile, paper-making, sugar-making and other factories and mines. Railway and highway transportation can all be designed. For example, a large-scale joint enterprise with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of steel, including the entire production process from mining, ore dressing, iron smelting, and steelmaking, can also be designed. Large-scale natural petroleum refineries and synthetic petroleum plants capable of refining one million tons of petroleum, and large-scale thermal power plants using 50,000-kilowatt medium-temperature and medium-pressure or high-temperature and high-pressure generator sets can also be designed by ourselves under the guidance of foreign experts. Large-scale coal mine shafts with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal, coal preparation plants with an annual output of 100,000 to 600,000 tons, various machine factories except for precision ones, various types of diesel engine factories, large and small shipyards for ocean and inland river transportation, large-scale sugar factories with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 2,000 tons similar to the Guangdong Zini Sugar Factory, medium and small-sized paper mills with a daily output of less than 200 tons of paper, and textile, printing and dyeing mills of cotton, hemp, and silk of all sizes, can all be designed by China. China's surveying and design started when Zhan Tianyou built the Ping-Sui Railway in 1903, and developed very little until the liberation in 1949. Only partial designs were done by ourselves in railways, transportation, and civil buildings. Industrial enterprises such as coal, electricity, and smelting were mostly built by imperialists, so very few industrial and mining enterprises were designed by Chinese people themselves, and they were also very small in scale. Now, China has 116,000 surveying and design production personnel, more than twice as many as in 1953. They can undertake the design tasks of most of the construction projects in the Second Five-Year Plan.

Large Factories and Mines Can Be Constructed and Installed
China has abundant labor resources, and the socialist consciousness of the workers is very high, so the construction and installation force is very strong. At present, China has more than 600 construction enterprises, with nearly 20,000 various mechanical equipment. By the end of the first half of this year, the earth and stone works done in the national basic construction (including water conservancy projects and dike maintenance projects done by agricultural cooperatives using agricultural loans) during the First Five-Year Plan can reach more than 8.2 billion cubic meters. According to estimates, it is equivalent to building 56 "Great Walls" in China. The completed building area of the national basic construction, including factory buildings, has reached more than 200 million square meters by the end of the first half of this year, which is equivalent to building ten Beijing cities before liberation in the whole country. The technical level of China's construction and installation has been greatly improved in five years. Now, if we build automobile factories and tractor factories again, we can fully undertake them from design to construction. The Ministry of Construction Engineering contracted a steel structure factory building of the same size, which used to take a whole year in 1953, but now it only takes four months. Now, the construction and installation of a special steel factory, a chemical fertilizer factory, and a non-ferrous metal processing factory can all be completed in one year or even more than one year less than when they were first built.

Most of the Domestically Produced Equipment Can Meet the Needs
China has basically used its own manufactured machinery and equipment to equip its own industry, and has used its own manufactured machinery to equip its transportation departments, agricultural departments, and strengthen national defense. Before the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, China could not manufacture airplanes, automobiles, metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, mining equipment, and radio equipment. The extremely backward state of new machine tools has been changed. However, we are still not satisfied with the supply of complete sets of equipment. In the metallurgical field, in 1952, China could only make some auxiliary equipment. Now, China can manufacture blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and coke ovens of all sizes. That is to say, for the equipment of metallurgical enterprises of the scale of Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise, except for a few large or precision machines such as large electric shovels, electric locomotives, and rolling mills, China can basically manufacture them. The equipment of small and medium-sized metallurgical enterprises can all be supplied. In terms of fuel, in 1952, China could not manufacture the main equipment for mines and open-pit coal mines. In 1957, the equipment for coal mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal can basically be manufactured except for large winches, large electric shovels, and large electric locomotives. In 1952, China could not make thermal power plant equipment. Now, all power plant equipment with turbine generators with a capacity of 12,000 kilowatts or less can be supplied by ourselves. In 1952, China could only make small hydropower station equipment of 3,000 kilowatts. Now, all those below 15,000 kilowatts can be manufactured. In 1952, we couldn't make any petroleum equipment. Now, oil extraction equipment can basically be manufactured, and oil refining equipment can also be manufactured next year. In the chemical industry, equipment for the annual production of 25,000 tons of synthetic ammonia can be started to be manufactured next year in China. In the mechanical field, the equipment of general machine factories can be fully supplied. Only precision machine tools, fully automatic machine tools, large forging presses, and combined machine tools still need further efforts. In the light industry field, in 1952, China began to be able to make cotton textile and knitting equipment. Now, ramie textile, tussah silk textile, and printing and dyeing equipment can all be made and can be fully supplied. Only the equipment for artificial synthetic fibers needs to be studied. China can now manufacture sugar-making equipment with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 2,000 tons and paper-making equipment with a daily paper output of 50 tons. As for domestically produced radio receivers, they have long been familiar to everyone. In terms of transportation, Liberation brand automobiles have been produced in batches, and new-style locomotives such as "Heping" (Peace) and "Jianshe" (Construction) manufactured by ourselves are running on the railway. Large and small ships manufactured by ourselves are sailing in China's coastal and Yangtze River areas. At present, only ocean-going ships cannot be found in China's product catalog. Airplanes and artillery used to strengthen national defense have also been manufactured long ago. In addition to various animal-drawn agricultural implements, agricultural machinery can also supply water conservancy irrigation equipment and donkey boilers, gas generators, hydropower stations and other power equipment for rural areas. In terms of machine-drawn agricultural implements, combine harvesters can already be manufactured, and small tractors are also being trial-produced.

Metal Materials Can Supply 90%
In 1952, China could only supply 60% of the metal materials, and this year it has supplied 90%. Now China can produce more than 3,000 specifications of steel and 370 kinds of steel. Because China's own metal varieties are not enough, from the perspective of metal varieties, many have not yet been manufactured in China.

    第一个五年计划的辉煌成就
    我国建设能力跃进一大步
    新华社26日讯　新华社记者田林报道：就国家建设委员会、国家计划委员会、国家技术委员会和国家统计局提供的最新材料来看，我国工业技术极端落后的状况已经改变，五年计划初期所遇到的工业技术水平同基本建设任务的矛盾，将要基本上获得解决。这是我国实行第一个五年计划所取得的一个巨大成果，也是苏联和其他兄弟国家无私援助的结果。
    地质勘探已经走在前头
    为重工业建设提供资源条件的地质勘探工作，已经建立了自己强大的队伍。只工程技术人员就达到二点六万多人，各种钻机达四千多台。地质工作曾是我国最落后的部门，从1907年开始到解放前，工程技术人员总共还不到二百人，钻机不到一百台，而且大部破旧，不堪利用。钻探进尺全部不到十五万公尺。五年来，我国的这支生力军，从中原到塞外，从柴达木盆地到康藏高原，脚迹遍布祖国各地，只钻探进尺就超过解放前的累计数字八十倍以上。他们爬山越岭，露宿风餐，为我国找到了约五十种矿种，使第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划的资源问题基本上得以解决。
    已能独立设计许多厂矿
    我国基本上已能靠自己的力量进行厂矿设计。第一个五年计划期间，依靠国外设计进行建设的局面目前已可改观。在第一个五年计划期间兴建的工程中，虽然大部分项目是我国自己设计的，但是，作为我国工业骨干的“一五六”项和其他一些限额以上的工程就依靠苏联的援助和其他兄弟国家的援助。目前，现代化的，中型和某些大型的冶金、煤炭、石油、电力、机械、纺织、造纸、制糖等厂矿，我国基本上能够设计。铁道和公路交通已全部能够设计。如包括从采矿、选矿、炼铁、炼钢全部生产过程年产一百五十万吨钢的大型联合企业，也可以设计出来。炼制一百万吨石油的大型天然石油炼厂和人造石油厂和用五万瓩中温中压或高温高压发电机组的大型火电站，在国外专家指导下也可以自己设计。年产九十万吨煤的大型煤矿矿井，年产一百到六百万吨的选煤厂，除精密以外的各种机器厂，各种类型的柴油机厂、远洋和内河运输的大小船舶制造厂，日榨甘蔗两千吨的跟广东紫坭糖厂规模差不多的大型糖厂，日产纸二百吨以下的中小型造纸厂，不论大小型的棉、麻、丝的纺织、印染厂等，我国都已能设计。我国勘察设计从1903年詹天佑建筑平绥铁路的时候开始，直到1949年解放止，很少发展。只在铁路、交通、民用建筑方面自己做过部分设计，工业如煤、电、冶炼企业绝大部分为帝国主义所建，因而中国人自己设计的工矿企业是极少的，也是规模非常小的。现在，我国勘察设计生产人员已有十一万六千人，比1953年多了二倍多。第二个五年计划绝大部分建设工程的设计任务，他们都能担负起来。
    大型厂矿都可建筑安装
    我国劳动力丰富，加以职工建设社会主义觉悟很高，建筑安装力量非常强大。目前我国已有建筑企业六百多个，拥有各种机械设备近二万台。至今年上半年底，在第一个五年计划期间，全国基本建设（包括农业社利用农贷所做的水利工程和堤防岁修在内）所作的土石方工程，可达八十二亿多立方公尺。据估算，等于在我国筑起了五十六条“万里长城”。全国基本建设已完工的房屋面积包括厂房在内，截至今年上半年止，达二亿多平方公尺，等于在全国修建了十个解放以前的北京城。我国建筑安装的技术水平，在五年中有很大提高。现在如再建汽车厂和拖拉机厂，从设计到施工，我们完全可以承担。建筑工程部承包一个同样大小的钢结构厂房，在1953年要作一整年，现在只用四个月。现在一个特殊钢厂、化学肥料厂、有色金属加工厂的建筑安装工程，都可以比开始做的时候少用一年，甚至一年以上的时间。
    国产设备大部能满足需要
    我国基本上已经用自己制造的机械设备来装备自己的工业，并且已经用自己制造的机械来装备我国的运输部门、农业部门和加强国防了。在实施五年计划以前，我国不能制造飞机、汽车、冶金设备、发电设备、采矿设备、无线电设备，新型机床的极端落后的状况已经改变，虽然，对于成套设备的供应，我们还不能尽如人意。在冶金方面，1952年我国只能作些附属设备，现在不论大小的高炉、平炉和炼焦炉，我国都能制造。就是像武汉钢铁联合企业那样规模的冶金企业的设备，除几种大型或精密机械如大电铲、电机车、轧钢机等以外，基本上我国都可以制造了，中小型冶金企业的设备，全部可以供应。燃料方面，在1952年，矿井和露天煤矿的主要设备我国都不能制造。1957年，年产六十万吨煤炭矿井的设备，除大卷扬机、大电铲、大电机车以外，基本上都能制造。火电站设备，在1952年我国还不能作。现在，每台一万二千瓩以下容量的透平发电机的电站设备，全部都可以自己供给。在1952年我国只能作三千瓩的小水电站设备，现在一万五千瓩以下的全都可以制造。石油设备，1952年什么也不会作。现在采油设备基本上可以制造，炼油设备明年也可以制造了。化工方面，年产二万五千吨合成氨的设备明年我国就可以开始制造。机械方面，一般机器厂的设备可以全部供应。只有精密机床、完全自动机床、大型锻压机和联合机床等还待进一步努力。轻工业方面，1952年我国开始能作棉纺织和针织设备，现在苎麻纺织、柞蚕丝纺织和印染设备全都会作，并且可以全部供应。只有人造合成纤维的设备还要研究。日榨甘蔗二千吨的制糖设备和日出纸张五十吨的造纸设备，我国都已能自己制造。至于国产无线电收音机早以为大家所熟悉。交通方面，解放牌汽车已经成批生产，铁路上已经跑着自己制造的新式的如“和平型”、“建设型”的机车，我国沿海和长江里航行着自己制造的大小轮船，目前只有远洋轮船还不能在我国产品目录中找到。用来加强国防的飞机和大炮，也早已制造出来。农业器械，除各种畜力农具以外，并且可以供应农村用的水利灌溉机具及锅驼机、煤气机、水电站等动力设备。机引农具方面，康拜因已经可以制造，小拖拉机也正在试制中。
    金属材料能供应90％
    金属材料，1952年，我国只能供应60％，今年已供应到90％。现在我国已能生产三千多种规格的钢材和三百七十种钢。由于我国自己所有的金属品种还不够多，所以金属材料从品种上看，许多我国还没有制造。
