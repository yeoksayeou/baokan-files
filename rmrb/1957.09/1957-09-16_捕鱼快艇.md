　　Fishing Speedboat
    A fishing speedboat is being manufactured in Seattle, USA, that can catch fish without any fishing gear. This 18-meter-long fast fishing boat is equipped with a 520-horsepower aviation engine and can travel at 65 kilometers per hour. There is a large-slotted steel chute at the bow that extends into the water. The hull has a net-like deck. When a school of fish is spotted, the boat speeds through the school at full speed, and the fish are lifted onto the deck by the chute. This method is only suitable for catching fish that swim in schools near the surface of the sea, such as tuna.

　　捕鱼快艇
    美国西雅图地方正在制造一种捕鱼快艇，不须任何鱼具就可以捕鱼。这种长十八公尺的快速渔艇，装有五百二十马力的航空发动机，每小时能行六十五公里。船头上有很大槽口的钢制斜槽，伸入水中。船身有网状的甲板。发现鱼群，船就全速在鱼群上疾驰而过，鱼就被斜槽托上甲板了。这种方法只适用于捕捉像鲔鱼之类成群在海面浮游觅食的鱼类。
