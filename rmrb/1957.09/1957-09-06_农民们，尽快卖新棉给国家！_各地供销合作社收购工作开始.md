Farmers, Sell New Cotton to the State as Soon as Possible!
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions Begin Procurement Work
Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Except for Shaanxi Province, new cotton has begun to be picked in cotton-producing areas across the country, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have also begun procurement. Since September 1st, the cotton-producing areas of Handan and Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province have purchased more than 200,000 jin of new cotton. By the end of August, Henan Province had purchased more than 500,000 jin of newly picked seed cotton. In Sichuan, the 20 counties that started procurement have purchased a total of 3,000 dan of ginned cotton in recent days. In Hubei Province, new cotton has been on the market successively since mid-August in counties such as Zaoyang and Hanchuan, with a daily market volume of 50,000 jin in Hanchuan County.

The quality of the cotton already purchased is generally better than last year. The cotton purchased in Henan Province is generally Grade 5, and in Shandong Province, it is mostly Grade 4 and 5, while last year it was Grade 5 and 6.

The supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions had already prepared for the procurement of new cotton before August. In order to achieve rapid and increased procurement and facilitate cotton sales for the masses, most regions have adjusted their purchasing stations. Regions that had abolished too many purchasing stations last year have appropriately increased them this year. The number of cotton purchasing stations established in Henan Province has increased by 24% compared to the peak procurement season last year, and the number of purchasing stations established in five special districts in Shandong Province, including Liaocheng, Jining, and Tai'an, has increased by more than 36% compared to last year. Various provinces have also trained a large number of procurement personnel. Most provinces and cities have prepared sufficient cotton packaging cloth and transportation tools. This year, the number of cotton inspection instruments has increased significantly, and they have already been transported to cotton-producing areas. The machine maintenance work of the power ginning mills in various regions has also been completed and they can start ginning on time.

The relevant person in charge of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives believes that although the cotton procurement preparation work has been done well this year, it is still quite arduous to complete the cotton procurement task. The procurement departments in various regions must educate procurement personnel to prevent blind optimism, and must earnestly achieve rapid and increased procurement. They must also publicize to farmers the importance of selling more cotton to support national construction. In order to ensure the standard of cotton grades, inspectors should conduct more research and experiments in their inspection work to prevent a careless work style, be realistic, implement the policy of higher prices for higher grades, and ensure that neither farmers nor the state suffer losses.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th. New cotton has begun to appear on the market in some areas of the cotton-producing regions of Shandong Province. This year, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have prepared various cotton purchasing preparations in advance, and are now actively carrying out procurement. Linqing County has taken in more than 20,000 jin of seed cotton on August 25; Gaotang, Dong'a and other counties have taken in nearly 2,000 jin of new cotton. New cotton in Bin County, Qidong, Shanghe and other counties are also gradually on the market.

The new cotton on the market this year has less moisture, higher quality and better grade, mostly in Grade 4 and Grade 5. The lint turnout rate is between 37 jin and 38 jin, an increase of 2 or 3 jin compared to the same period last year. The majority of cotton farmers are satisfied with the initial price of new cotton this year, and are now drying and cleaning the harvested first blooms to sell to the state.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th. New cotton is on the market in Jiangsu Province. Cotton farmers, who have been educated in socialist ideology, are quickly picking, drying, and cleaning cotton according to the maturity of the cotton, and selling the new cotton to the state as soon as possible.

The supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions of the province have prepared for procurement, and have trained more than 1,700 cotton inspection personnel to correctly implement the policy of "higher prices for higher grades" to purchase cotton. (Attached picture)

In Xiajin County, a major cotton-producing area in Shandong Province, many agricultural cooperatives, under the slogan of "sell as you pick," are selling the newly picked cotton to the state. Judging from the procurement situation at the Nantun procurement station, although it is the early cotton season, since the station opened on August 27, it has been able to purchase about 10,000 jin of new cotton every day. However, the daily purchase volume in the same period last year was only a few hundred jin.

    农民们，尽快卖新棉给国家！
    各地供销合作社收购工作开始
    新华社4日讯　全国各产棉区，除陕西省外，已经开始采摘新棉，各地供销社也已开始收购。河北省邯郸、石家庄两个产棉区从9月1日以来已收购了新棉二十多万斤。河南省到8月底已收购新摘的籽棉五十多万斤。四川开始收购的二十个县近几天共收购皮棉三千担。湖北省的枣阳、汉川等县从8月中旬起新棉就陆续上市，汉川县每天上市量达五万斤。
    已经收购的棉花，品质一般比去年较好。河南省收购的棉花一般为五级，山东省多为四、五级，而去年则为五、六级。
    各地供销社收购新棉的准备工作早在8月份以前就做好了。为了作到快收多购，便利群众售棉，各地大都调整了采购站。去年撤销采购站过多的地区，今年又适当地增加。河南省设立的棉花采购站比去年收购旺季时增加了24％，山东省聊城、济宁、泰安等五个专区建立的采购站比去年增加36％以上。各省还训练了大批采购人员。棉花包装布和运输工具，多数省市已经备足。今年的棉花验收仪器增加了很多，并且早已运到产棉区。各地动力轧花厂的机器检修工作也已经结束，可以按时开工轧花。
    中华全国供销合作总社有关负责人认为，今年棉花采购准备工作虽然已经做好，但是要完成棉花采购任务还是相当艰巨的。各地采购部门必须教育采购人员，防止产生盲目乐观情绪，要切实做到快收多购，并且要向农民宣传多卖棉花支援国家建设的道理，为了保证棉花等级标准，验收人员在验收工作中要多研究多试验，防止粗枝大叶的工作作风，要实事求是，贯彻优等优价的政策，做到农民、国家都不吃亏。
    新华社济南4日电　山东省棉花产区部分地区新棉开始登市。今年各地供销社提前做好了各项购棉的准备工作，现在正积极进行收购。临清县于8月25日已收进籽棉二万余斤；高唐、东阿等县收进新棉近二千斤。滨县、齐东、商河等县新棉也正陆续上市。
    今年上市的新花，水份少、质量高、品级好，大都在四级和五级。衣分率在三十七斤至三十八斤，较去年同期增加了二、三斤。广大棉农对今年新棉初期的售价感到满意，现正将收获的头喷花晒干拣净出售给国家。
    新华社南京4日电　江苏省新棉上市。受到社会主义思想教育的棉农，正在根据棉花成熟情况快拾快晒快拣，尽快地把新棉卖给国家。
    省内各地供销社作好了收购的准备工作，并且训练了一千七百多名棉花检验人员，以便正确贯彻“优级优价”的政策来收购棉花。（附图片）
    山东省主要产棉区夏津县很多农业社，在“随收随卖”的口号下，纷纷把摘下的新棉卖给国家。从南屯收购站的收购情况来看，目前虽是早棉登场时节，该站从8月27日开秤以来，每日就可收购新棉万斤左右。但去年同期每日收购量只有几百斤。
