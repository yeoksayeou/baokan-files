American Dark Side

	Mail Frequently Stolen
	Manila, September 9 (Xinhua News Agency) – Philippine Postmaster General Palomar said on the 9th that mail sent from the United States to the Philippines is frequently damaged and stolen. For the past five years, many mailbags carried by American ships have been slashed open, and many letters and packages inside have been opened.
	Palomar said that he has written many letters to the American Postmaster General and American shipping companies regarding this matter, lodging protests with them, but has consistently been ignored by the American side.
	He said that he will request higher authorities to lodge further protests with the United States.

	Fifteen-Year-Old Juvenile Offender Sentenced to Electric Chair
	Philadelphia, September 9 (Xinhua News Agency) – An American court in Philadelphia sentenced a fifteen-year-old juvenile offender, Isaiah Green, to death by electric chair on September 9.
	Green admitted that he and two partners robbed a pharmacist and that he shot and killed the pharmacist.
	The judge said that this is the first time in Pennsylvania that a person under the age of eighteen has been sentenced to death, because there are too many juvenile murderers now, with even fourteen and fifteen-year-olds committing crimes, so he must give a heavier sentence.

	Racists Rampant
	Nashville, Tennessee (Xinhua News Agency) – Racists in Nashville, Tennessee, detonated explosives at a newly integrated elementary school on the morning of September 10, threatening other schools not to allow black and white students to attend school together.
	In Birmingham, Alabama, about twenty racist thugs attacked local black movement leader Shuttleworth on September 9. Shuttleworth was driving his two daughters and two other black students to register at a formerly all-white school when the thugs pulled Shuttleworth out of the car and beat him severely after he got out of the car.
	Afterward, the authorities sent police to "guard" all white schools, preventing black students from entering.
	On the same day in Little Rock, Arkansas, a group of racists forcibly drove six black students who came to register at North Little Rock High School off campus.
	The school principal came out and asked the six black students to follow him, but the racists were extremely rampant and threatened the principal, forcing him to abandon his efforts and tell the black students to go home.
	Although the Southern states have disregarded the Supreme Court's decision, and recent incidents of opposition to blacks entering white schools have occurred one after another, the U.S. federal government and President Eisenhower have not yet taken any serious action.

专栏：美国黑幕

　　美国黑幕
    邮件经常遭盗窃
    菲律宾邮政总长帕洛马尔9日说，美国寄菲律宾的邮件经常遭到损坏和盗窃。五年来，许多由美国轮船运载的邮包被割破，里面的信件和包裹很多被拆开。
    帕洛马尔说，他已经为这件事写了很多信件给美国邮政部长和美国轮船公司，向他们提出了抗议，但是，一直遭到美国方面的漠视。
    他说，他将要求高级当局向美国提出进一步的抗议。
    十五岁的童犯被判决坐电椅
    美国费城法庭9月9日判决用电椅处死一个十五岁的犯罪儿童以赛阿·格林。
    格林承认他同两个伙伴共同抢劫一个药剂师，他开枪打死了那个药剂师。
    法官说，在宾夕法尼亚州，这是第一次判十八岁以下儿童以死刑，因为现在少年犯谋杀罪的太多，甚至十四五岁的孩子都行凶，所以他必须判得重些。
    种族主义分子猖獗
    田纳西州纳希维尔的种族主义分子10日清晨用炸药炸毁了一座刚刚在9日接纳了几名黑人学生的小学校，来威胁其他学校不得让黑白学生同校。
    在亚拉巴马州伯明翰，二十名左右种族主义分子暴徒9日向当地黑人运动领袖休特尔沃思进行袭击。休特尔沃思用汽车送他自己的两个女孩和其他两名黑人学生到原来是清一色的白人学校去注册，暴徒就在休特尔沃思走出汽车后把他拉走痛打一顿。
    事后，当局派警察“守卫”所有白人学校，不许黑人学生进去。
    同一天在阿肯色州小石城，一批种族主义分子用武力把六名来北小石城中学注册的黑人学生赶出了校园。
    这个学校的校长曾经出来叫六名黑人学生跟在他后面走，但是种族主义分子非常猖狂，向校长进行威胁，校长只好放弃努力，叫黑人学生回家。
    尽管南方各州不顾最高法院决定，最近陆续发生反对黑人进入白人学校的事件，美国联邦政府和总统艾森豪威尔直到现在还没有认真采取任何行动。
