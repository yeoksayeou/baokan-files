Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 16th: The Indonesian National Consultative Council concluded on the evening of September 14th after President Sukarno and former Vice President Hatta signed a joint statement.

The conference also passed a resolution welcoming the joint statement of Sukarno and Hatta. The resolution also stated that the conference unanimously believes that with the conclusion of the conference, "normal relations between the central government and local authorities have been restored" on the basis of the provisional constitution and laws.

The Sukarno-Hatta joint statement stated that all Indonesian people have a responsibility to defend and maintain the unity of Indonesia. The statement indicates that their absolute responsibility is to continue to safeguard and defend the foundation of the Indonesian Republic's declaration of independence under any circumstances, together with all the Indonesian people and national authorities.

The conference passed resolutions from four subcommittees.

The resolution of the Special Issues Subcommittee mentioned that Sukarno and Hatta had expressed their willingness to cooperate in the talks. The resolution hopes that the government and parliament will continue to explore all possible avenues in the future to restore the "dual leadership" of Sukarno and Hatta, and that its form should conform to the "nature and status of the head of state." Regarding the issue of political parties, the resolution decided that regulations on political parties must be formulated in the short term so that the various political parties can participate in national construction and welfare undertakings. The resolution believes that "national vigilance" must be maintained to deal with any activities from abroad that attempt to make Indonesia abandon its foreign policy of defending international peace and independence and harming Indonesia's national interests. The resolution believes that Indonesia must also be vigilant against possible dangers at home, and strive to maintain national integrity, eliminate the influence of colonialism in the economic and cultural fields, and strengthen the unity of all national forces in the country.

The resolution also stated that the struggle to recover West Irian must continue. The resolution agreed in principle to move the capital from Jakarta to another location.

The resolutions of the Government and General Affairs Subcommittee and the Financial Affairs Subcommittee made principled provisions on issues such as financial allocation and the division of autonomous regions. The resolution pointed out that barter trade in some places is detrimental to the country, so trade must be restored to normal, while local authorities must be given foreign exchange. The resolution also mentioned the hope that the role of foreign businessmen in acquisition, processing and even export will gradually be transferred to Indonesian entrepreneurs.

The content of the resolution of the Military Affairs Subcommittee has not yet been released.
