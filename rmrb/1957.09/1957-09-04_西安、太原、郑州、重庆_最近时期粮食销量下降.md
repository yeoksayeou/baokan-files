    Grain Sales Decline Recently
    (Xinhua News Agency) Grain sales have recently declined in Xi'an, Chongqing, and Zhengzhou. Xi'an's total sales volume in July decreased by 3.65 million jin compared to the average monthly sales volume in the second quarter, and the monthly sales volume in the first half of August also remained stable at the level of July. In Chongqing, more than 110,000 households and more than 1,000 collective mess halls have formulated plans to save grain, saving more than 490,000 jin of grain per month. Zhengzhou saved a total of 3,819,000 jin of grain in the second half of the 1956-1957 grain year.
    State personnel and ordinary residents in the above-mentioned areas have initially established a habit of saving grain. Like many residents in Chongqing, after carefully calculating and determining how to save grain, they have voluntarily requested the grain department to reduce the supply quantity; from September 1st, all government offices, factories, mines, schools, and citizens in Zhengzhou have cancelled grain subsidies and appropriately increased the consumption of coarse grains and non-staple foods to save staple grains.
    Insisting on the grain consumption registration system, requiring grain coupons before meals, rewarding model figures and collective mess halls for saving grain, and conducting education through exhibitions and seminars have played a significant role in saving grain.
    (Reported by this newspaper) From January to June this year, the vast majority of staff and workers in organs, groups, factories, and enterprises and most residents of Taiyuan responded to the call of the Municipal People's Committee to save half a jin to one jin of grain per person per month within the original supply amount based on the principle of "saving enough to eat," saving the country 2.7 million jin of grain. In addition, collective mess halls and citizens returned 3.37 million jin of surplus grain and grain coupons; the city also saved the country 5.4 million jin of grain by using processed by-products such as wheat bran and bean cake to replace livestock feed; and also saved the country 1.26 million jin of grain by reducing warehousing and transportation losses and improving the product rate of grain processing. The above items totaled 12.73 million jin of grain saved for the country.
    Although Taiyuan's grain saving work has achieved considerable results, there are still loopholes in the supply, such as lax household registration management and a considerable number of instances of reporting births but not deaths, and reporting arrivals but not departures. In some units and residents, there are still phenomena of exchanging grain for cooking oil and eggs, and raising chickens and feeding pigs. There are also problems with poor grain storage, such as insect infestation, rat consumption, mold spoilage, transportation losses, and grain processing. (Chang Guoying)

    西安、太原、郑州、重庆
    最近时期粮食销量下降
    据新华社讯 西安、重庆、郑州粮食销量最近有了下降。西安市7月份销售总量，比第二季度的平均月销量下降三百六十五万斤，8月上半月的月销量也稳定在7月份的基础上。重庆市有十一万多户居民和一千多个集体伙食单位订出了节约粮食的计划，每月节约粮食四十九万多斤。郑州市在1956—1957粮食年度的下半年，共节约了粮食三百八十一万九千多斤。
    上述各地的国家工作人员和一般居民初步树立了节约粮食的风气。像重庆市的许多居民在精打细算地确定了节约用粮以后，纷纷自动报请粮食部门减少供应数量；郑州各机关、厂矿、学校和市民，从9月1日起取消了补助粮，并适当地增吃粗粮和副食品以节约主粮。
    坚持用饭的登记制度、先交粮票后搭伙、奖励节约粮食的模范人物和集体伙食单位，以及通过展览、座谈等方式进行教育，对节约粮食起了很大的作用。
    本报讯　太原市今年1月至6月，全市机关、团体、厂矿、企业职工和绝大部分居民响应了市人民委员会本着“节约够吃”的原则，每人每月在原定供应量内节约粮食半斤至一斤的号召，为国家节约了二百七十万斤粮食，另外，各集体伙食单位和市民又交回多余的粮食及粮票三百三十七万斤；全市用加工后的副产品如麦麸、豆饼等代替牲畜饲料，也为国家节约粮食五百四十万斤；在降低仓储、运输损耗、提高粮食加工产品率方面也为国家节约了一百二十六万斤粮食。以上各项共为国家节约了粮食一千二百七十三万斤。
    太原市粮食节约工作，虽然取得不小的成绩。但供应中仍有漏洞，如户口管理不严，报生不报死，报来不报走的现象还相当多。在一些单位和居民中，还有用粮食换食油，换鸡蛋，养鸡喂猪的现象。粮食保管不好，如生虫、鼠吃、霉烂变质，运输损耗，粮食加工等方面也还存在问题。（常国英）
