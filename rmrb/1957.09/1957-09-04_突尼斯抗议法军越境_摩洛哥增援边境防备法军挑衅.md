    Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd dispatch: Tunis dispatch: The Tunisian government issued a communique on September 2nd, accusing the French army in Algeria of crossing the border into Tunisia on September 1st, killing seven Tunisian border guards. On the same day, Secretary of State Boi Radham, acting as president, also lodged a formal protest with the French diplomatic representative regarding this matter.
    Since the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army stationed in Algeria, Salan, was authorized by Defense Minister Maurice last week to order the French army to cross the border "when necessary" to continue pursuing the Algerian National Liberation Army, the French army has amassed a strong force along the borders of Tunisia and Morocco. In a war report released on September 1st, the Algerian French army authorities also admitted that the French army had crossed the border into Tunisia.
    In addition, according to reports from Rabat, the Moroccan government is drawing infantry and police forces to strengthen border defenses adjacent to Algeria to deal with possible provocative actions by France. The "Opinion" newspaper, the organ of the Moroccan opposition party "Independent Democratic Party," reported on September 1st that the French army had crossed from Algeria into Morocco last week under the pretext of pursuing Algerian insurgents, conducting indiscriminate searches in many villages along the border.

    突尼斯抗议法军越境
    摩洛哥增援边境防备法军挑衅
    据新华社3日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯政府在9月2日发表公报，指责阿尔及利亚境内法军9月1日越境冲入突尼斯，打死了七名突尼斯边防军。同一天，代行总统职务的国务部长伯伊·拉德哈姆还就这件事向法国外交代表提出了正式抗议。
    自从驻阿尔及利亚法军总司令萨兰上周根据国防部长莫里斯的授权下令法军“在必要情况下”得以越过边境继续追击阿尔及利亚民族解放军部队之后，法军就沿突尼斯和摩洛哥的边境地区集结了强大兵力。阿尔及利亚法军当局在9月1日发布的战报中也承认法军曾经越境进入突尼斯。
    另外据来自拉巴特的消息说，摩洛哥政府正在抽调步兵和警察部队增强毗邻阿尔及利亚的边境防务，以对付法国可能的挑衅行动。摩洛哥在野党“独立民主党”机关报“舆论报”9月1日报道，法军在上星期曾经借口追击阿尔及利亚起义者由阿尔及利亚冲入摩洛哥境内沿国境的许多村庄，滥施搜索。（附图片）
