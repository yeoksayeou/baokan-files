Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd. The majority of the more than 700 cotton purchasing stations in Hubei Province have already opened to purchase new cotton. Agricultural cooperative members in cotton-producing areas are responding to the national call for "quick picking, quick ginning, quick selling" and are enthusiastically selling new cotton to the state. Staff at the purchasing stations have also proposed to achieve "quick purchasing, quick transportation."

In Zaoyang, Hanchuan, Huangmei, and other counties where cotton matures earlier, new cotton has been entering the market successively since mid-August. In the past two days, the daily market volume in Hanchuan County has reached more than 50,000 jin. The more than 280,000 jin of new cotton purchased by the state here is being shipped to Wuhan.

Preparations for the province-wide purchase of new cotton were uniformly arranged as early as the first half of this year. The province adjusted the establishment of the purchasing network, trained inspection personnel, and, in accordance with the requirements of "quick purchasing, quick transportation," tried to transport new cotton directly from the producing areas to the sales areas. In terms of purchasing methods, this year, various localities will generally adopt the method of demarcating areas, setting locations, making appointments, and using vouchers to avoid cotton farmers delaying production due to selling cotton.

This newspaper reports: Shandong and Jiangxi provincial leading departments recently issued instructions on the 1957 cotton unified purchase work. The instructions require all localities to strengthen political and ideological education for cotton farmers to ensure the completion of the cotton unified purchase task.

This year, cotton growth in most areas of Shandong and Jiangxi is good, and new cotton has begun to be picked in some areas. Regarding cotton farmers' self-use cotton, the instructions of the two provinces require all localities to adhere to the state-stipulated retention standards. Since the state's cotton planting area has been reduced this year, Shandong Province has decided to reduce the original self-use cotton of ordinary cotton farmers from three jin (lint) to two and a half jin, and encourages farmers to sell as much self-use cotton as possible to the state. Jiangxi Province stipulates that all self-use cotton retained by cotton-producing cooperatives shall be adjusted and distributed by the agricultural cooperatives according to the actual needs of the members, and that good-quality cotton should be sold to the state as much as possible.

In order to resolutely implement the state's policy of unified purchase of cotton, the two provinces have decided to effectively close the free cotton market. Cotton farmers who sell self-retained cotton must sell it to supply and marketing cooperatives or departments entrusted by the state to purchase it. Specific instructions have also been made on issues such as purchasing methods and correct mastery of purchasing prices.

    响应国家号召“快摘快轧快售”
    湖北农民踊跃卖新棉
    山东、江西领导部门指示对棉农加强政治思想教育
    新华社武汉3日电　湖北省的七百多个棉花收购点，绝大部分已经开秤收购新棉。产棉区农业社社员正响应国家“快摘、快轧、快售”的号召，踊跃地将新棉卖给国家。收购站的工作人员们也提出要做到“快收、快运”。
    在棉花成熟较早的枣阳、汉川、黄梅等县，从8月中旬起，新棉就陆续上市。这两天，汉川县每天上市量达五万多斤，国家在这里收购的二十八万多斤新棉，正向武汉市启运。
    全省收购新棉的准备工作早在今年上半年就作了统一安排。全省调整了收购网的设置，训练了检验人员，并且根据“快收、快运”的要求，尽量把新棉由产区直接运到销地。在收购方式上，今年各地将普遍采用划片定点、约时凭证的办法，避免棉农因售棉而耽误生产。
    本报讯　山东和江西省级领导部门最近发出了关于1957年度棉花统购工作的指示。指示要求各地加强对棉农的政治思想教育，保证棉花统购任务的完成。
    今年山东、江西大部分地区的棉花生长良好，部分地区新棉已开始采摘。关于棉农自用棉花，两省指示都要求各地坚持国家规定的留量标准。由于今年国家棉花种植面积缩小，因此山东省决定将一般棉农原来留自用棉三斤（皮棉）减为二斤半，并鼓励农民把自用棉尽多卖给国家。江西省规定凡各产棉社留下自用棉花，一律由农业社根据社员实际需要情况调剂分配，并尽可能把质量好的棉花卖给国家。
    为坚决贯彻国家统购棉花的政策，两省决定切实关闭棉花自由市场，凡是棉农出售自留棉花，必须卖给供销社或国家委托收购的部门。关于收购方法、正确掌握收购价格等问题，也作了具体指示。
