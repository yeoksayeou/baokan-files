Capitalist Countries are Decadent
Juvenile Delinquency is Getting Worse

    The "New York Times" recently published a special dispatch and an article by Elden stating that juvenile delinquency is rampant in the capitalist world, and the situation in the United States is "getting worse."

    United States
    In New York, people under the age of 21 account for 14.9% of those arrested for various crimes, 50% of those arrested for robbery, and 61.3% of those arrested for theft. A social worker pointed out that these statistics do not fully reflect the extent of juvenile delinquency. In many cities in the United States, this problem has become "a threatening issue that requires special handling."

    England
    A London police chief said that in the past two years, juvenile crime among teenagers in London has increased to a "worrying" level. The number of juvenile offenders aged eight to twenty-one arrested in 1956 increased by 12.6% compared to 1955, and 1955 increased by 9.3% compared to 1954. In 1956, acts of violence committed by people under the age of twenty-one accounted for 25.3% of the total number of crimes that year. Two-thirds of the juvenile offenders arrested last year committed crimes in gangs. They formed gangs with names such as "Skull Squad" and "Doo-Doo Squad," specializing in barbaric and violent acts, and fighting each other.
    Recently, two nine-year-old children in Poldon, on the banks of the River Dearne in England, laid six concrete pillars in a row on the railway line; according to their confession, they hoped that after the train overturned, they could rob the passengers' wallets.

    West Germany
    According to statistics from the West Berlin police, one out of every five arrested criminals is a teenager between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one. These teenagers engage in activities such as attacking couples in parks, teasing women walking alone in parks, stealing cars, breaking into stores that are closing, and vandalizing parks. Juvenile alcoholism is also increasing.

    资本主义国家世风日下
    少年犯罪情况越来越糟
    “纽约时报”最近发表的特讯和艾尔登的一篇文章说，少年犯罪问题遍及资本主义世界，美国在这方面的情况是“越来越糟”了。
    美　国
    在纽约，因各种罪行而被捕的人中二十一岁以下的人占14.9％，在因抢劫而被捕的人中占50％，在因盗窃而被捕的人中占61.3％。一位社会工作者指出，这种统计还不能说明少年犯罪的全部情况。在美国的许多城市中，这个问题都成了“需要特别处理的一个威胁性问题”。
    英　国
    伦敦一位警察局长说，最近两年中，伦敦十多岁儿童犯罪案件已经增加到了“值得忧虑”的程度。1956年被捕的八岁到二十一岁的少年罪犯人数比1955年增加12.6％，而1955年比1954年增加9.3％。1956年二十一岁以下的人所犯的暴行罪达到这一年犯罪总数的25.3％。去年逮捕的少年罪犯中有三分之二是结成帮犯罪的。他们结成了以“骷髅队”、“嘟嘟队”等等为名的帮，专门作野蛮粗暴的事，并相互斗殴。
    最近，英国有两个九岁的小孩在德尔恩河畔的波尔敦的铁路线上，一连立下了六根水泥柱子；据他们供称，他们指望火车撞翻了以后，好大掏旅客的腰包。
    西　德
    据西柏林警察局统计，每五个被捕的犯罪者之中就有一个是十四岁到二十一岁的少年。这些少年的活动有结帮攻击公园里的情侣、戏谑在公园单独散步的妇女、盗窃汽车、闯进收摊的商店、捣毁公园等等。少年酗酒事件也越来越多。
