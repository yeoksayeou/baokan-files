Young People Going to the Countryside
By our reporter Gu Weijin

Determined to be a Michurin student
Hu Disong came to Shanghai from Songdian Township, Huangpi County, Hubei Province, several years ago, and most of his youth was spent in the apprentice life of the crate industry. He didn't have much hope for this profession, so he went to night school to study in his spare time. He planned to finish elementary school, go to middle school, and then find a way to go to a regular school... He fantasized that he might become someone in the future. However, after finishing elementary school, he failed to get into middle school, and he felt quite sad. One day, he bought a book titled "The Great Transformer of Nature - Michurin" in a bookstore, read it several times, and began to think: Michurin only had a junior elementary school education, but he was able to transform nature and create such great happiness for the Soviet people. His own cultural level was similar to Michurin's at that time, so why couldn't he be like Michurin? He decided to learn from Michurin. He read many of Michurin's works and some agricultural science and technology books. In 1954, he decided to return to the countryside to become a Michurin student.

However, his uncle Hu Qihai (an old employee of the Shanghai Tram Company), who had introduced him to work in Shanghai, did not agree with his approach. He said, "You are doing well in Shanghai, why do you want to go back? Farming, the old ox turning over soil, what kind of future is that!"

He patiently explained to his uncle: "I only have the knowledge of junior elementary school, which is nothing in Shanghai. If I return to the countryside, I will be considered a knowledgeable youth; if I study Michurin hard and promote agricultural science and technology, I will definitely have a future!"

"Silly child! There is only one Michurin in the world, how can you learn from him?"

"Michurin is one person, and I am also one person. If he can research things, why can't I? Besides, Michurin's research was done in the Tsarist era when no one supported him, and I am in the Mao Zedong era, which is a much better condition."

His uncle said with a serious expression: "Young people really don't understand things! Others say that the countryside is hard and want to come to the city, but you want to go back to the countryside to study Michurin. Your father has suffered all his life farming, why do you still want to suffer?"

"For the development of production and the construction of a new socialist countryside, what is suffering!" Hu Disong said excitedly: "Liu Hulan and Dong Cunrui even sacrificed their lives for the happiness of mankind! Without these martyrs, there would be no today, and if today's youth do not endure hardship, there will be no happy tomorrow!"

"Hum! Where did that come from..." His uncle listened impatiently, his face gloomy, and went out.

Initial arrival in his hometown
Hu Disong considered that it would be difficult to get his uncle's consent to return to his hometown to participate in agricultural production. He quietly went back.

The people in his hometown heard that Hu Disong had returned and went to visit him—to see what a person who had returned from Shanghai was like. They saw him wearing old clothes, local shoes, and his luggage was as simple as an old wooden box. ... All of this did not look like someone from a big city. The deputy township head, Hu Dongyuan, glanced at him, frowned and said:

"You've been out for so many years, and you only brought this little back? What about bedding and clothes?"

"I left them all in Shanghai, and only carried back a box of books." He said happily, pointing to the old wooden box.

Hu Dongyuan and everyone laughed. Behind their backs, they discussed whether this young man was mentally ill. The elderly father, seeing his son like this, said nothing, just shook his head and sighed. Hu Disong didn't care about all this, and he enthusiastically participated in the youth mutual aid group.

However, after working for a few days, Hu Disong couldn't take it anymore. At night, he was exhausted; his shoulders were swollen with two red bumps from the burden, and he touched them lightly with his hand, which was very painful. He was really afraid of carrying burdens again, and even feared doing other work. He doubted whether he could continue to endure hardship like this. When he was in Shanghai, he had prepared himself ideologically for returning to endure hardship, and he believed that he would definitely be able to endure hardship, but why couldn't he endure hardship now that he was in the actual situation? If he couldn't endure hardship, how could he talk about promoting agricultural science and technology? ... This night, he was very tired and couldn't keep his eyes open, but for some reason, he couldn't sleep. He went to the bookshelf and found a story about the Red Army's Long March to read. He was deeply attracted by the deeds inside. He compared his current suffering with the suffering of the Red Army climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands... He felt a heat on his face.

After several months of training, Hu Disong could endure hardship, and he could do all kinds of work.

Boldly implementing technical reforms
A year later, Hu Disong joined the Happiness Advanced Cooperative. He devoted himself to realizing his original wish—during breaks in the fields or before going to bed at night, he diligently studied Michurin's works and some agricultural science and technology books, combining them with practical production experience, and began to carry out small-scale technical reform experiments.

In the spring of 1956, Hu Disong bought three catties of potatoes from the town. People thought he bought them to eat, but when they heard that he bought them to plant, they laughed: "We have never grown potatoes here, why did you think of planting this thing? It won't grow, you fool!" However, according to the planting methods of potatoes introduced in the book, as well as the results of research with the old farmers, he planted the potatoes, and they grew up soon. He also grew Sichuan pickles and Henan ginger based on the knowledge in the books and the experience of the old farmers.

Before the crops reached maturity, and people could see the results of the harvest, they all looked down on Hu Disong's technical reform experiment. Hu Disong didn't care, and he was thinking about continuing to do other technical reform experiments.

One day, Hu Disong walked towards a barren mountain near the village. The mountain was not high. There were dozens of acres of flat land on the top of the mountain; the yellow land was barren. Hu Disong walked and thought here: the village was densely populated and had little land, how good would it be to plant something on this land! After that, he read books on soil problems and learned that the reason why this barren mountain could not grow anything was that the soil was too sticky. If he loosened the raw soil, weathered it, and mixed it with a layer of fertile soil, it could grow something—according to the needs of the cooperative, he planned to plant cotton. He studied this approach with the technicians of the county agricultural bureau, and they said he could try it. However, when he discussed this approach with the cooperative cadres, they all shook their heads and waved their hands, saying: "Planting cotton on barren mountains? Never heard of it, absurd..." Hu Disong was not discouraged, and he got twenty-five cotton seedlings from the county agricultural bureau and planted them on the barren mountain for experimentation. The cotton seedlings grew very vigorously. The higher authorities actively supported Hu Disong's technical reform. The management committee then decided to carry out a small-scale cotton planting experiment on the barren mountain.

In autumn, the cooperative's late-season japonica rice was very short of fertilizer. Hu Disong saw the good fertilizer effect, simple production method, and low cost of granular fertilizer introduced in the newspaper, and suggested that the management committee let him manufacture granular fertilizer to solve the problem of the late-season japonica rice shortage of fertilizer. The management committee did not believe in the effectiveness of granular fertilizer, and they advised Hu Disong not to worry about this.

Hu Disong privately made a little granular fertilizer and applied it to a seedling. After two days, this seedling grew particularly well compared to other seedlings. The cooperative members paid attention. The director of the cooperative, Hu Dongyuan, said to the second team leader, Hu Qishan: "It seems that granular fertilizer is not bad, are you dare to use it in your team?" Hu Qishan squinted his eyes and said: "We don't believe in this evil; but, we can try it!" The results of the experiment showed that the seedlings did grow particularly well. Each team was competing to use granular fertilizer. With the assistance of the management committee, Hu Disong made 18,000 catties of granular fertilizer to meet the needs of each team.

Autumn harvest arrived. Hu Disong did not expect that the technical reforms of the past year would achieve such great results. The 180 mu of late-season japonica rice that had been fertilized with granular fertilizer had an average unit area yield of 800 catties (those that had not been fertilized with granular fertilizer only had 600-700 catties), saving fertilizer investment of 1,746 yuan (calculated by purchasing cake fertilizer); the three mu of cotton planted on the barren mountain had an average unit area yield of 107 catties (lint), which was four or five times higher than cotton in general fields; potatoes, pickles, ginger, etc. also had a bumper harvest.

A struggle with his wife
Hu Disong was very happy with the success of the technical reforms. However, thinking of the fierce ideological struggle that had taken place not long ago with his wife due to different understandings of the future of the countryside, which led to disharmony in the family, his heart felt heavy.

The matter started like this: In the spring, workers who were temporary workers in Hankou often came back to the township. They wore tweed hats, khaki cotton coats, and new leather shoes. People saw them so wealthy and envied them for being workers in the city. Hu Disong's wife, Gao Yumei, a young woman with a strong personality who loves face, saw that her lover was wearing ragged clothes and not eating well, so she advised him:

"There is no future in the countryside, go to the city to be a worker as soon as possible!"

"Hey! I came out of the city, don't I know what the life of a worker is like? From the surface, it looks a little better than living in the countryside, but in reality, after various expenses, it won't be much better than living in the countryside, don't be fooled by their wealthy appearance." Hu Disong said.

"That's what you say, but what future do you have if you live in the countryside?"

"I will engage in technical reforms, improve production, run the cooperative well, and build a new socialist countryside, that is the future!"

"When will you see this future? You should still go out to be a worker—if you go out, it doesn't matter if you don't send money back, I can take care of myself by working."

"No, I want to engage in technical reforms; I believe I will succeed!"

"That's an illusion, people are laughing at you for doing 'bad things'!"

"What does it matter if they laugh?"

"It's useless!"

"Looking down on people in the countryside is useless!" Hu Disong got angry and said angrily.

"If you don't go out, I won't work and I'll divorce you!" Gao Yumei also got angry and said angrily.

From then on, the couple's relationship was not very good, they didn't talk much when they met, and sometimes when Hu Disong came home late, she didn't leave him food, and she didn't wash the clothes Hu Disong changed out of...

Night talk
After the success of Hu Disong's technical reforms, the cooperative attached great importance to it. After the autumn harvest, Hu Disong, as an ordinary member and an ordinary member of the Communist Youth League, was successively elected as the cooperative's technical director, supervisor, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, advanced youth producer, and Huangpi County's first-class labor model (attended the Hubei Provincial Labor Model Conference), etc.

Many people were envious of Hu Disong, and even his wife was no exception. - This was completely visible from her eyes, her smile, and her tone. He decided to have a good talk with his wife.

That night, the moon hung high in the sky outside the window, and under the moon, the clouds were moving quickly. Hu Disong glanced at his wife and said softly:

"What do you think of the future of the countryside now? Do you still want me to go to the city to be a worker?"

His wife raised her dark eyes and looked at him, pursing her lips and smiling, and after a while, slowly said:

"Now, of course... the situation is different..."

"What's different?"

His wife pursed her lips again and smiled, and said softly:

"Look at you! You have succeeded in technical reforms, helped the cooperative to improve production, and won many honors, and people look up to you - from you, you can see the future of the countryside - a very good future for young people!"

Hu Disong's face glowed with happiness. Gao Yumei continued:

"Now I not only won't let you go to the city to be a worker, but I myself will also work hard. If I hadn't been in a bad mood some time ago and worked less, our income this year would have been much higher than it is now." (Attached picture)

Except for Wu Fangde, the head of the Gaoan County Junyang Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Jiangxi, most of them are graduates of senior elementary school and junior high school. They love the countryside and are content with their work in the countryside.

    到农村去的青年人
    本报记者  古维进
    决心当米丘林的学生
    胡迪松从家乡湖北省黄陂县宋店乡来到上海好几年了，他的青春大部分消磨在板箱业的徒工生活里。他对于这个职业没有多少希望，他在工余的时候就上夜校读书。他计划念完小学上中学，然后设法上正规学校……他幻想将来也许会成为一个什么人物。但是他念完小学之后，没有考进中学，心里挺难过。这天，他在书店买了一本“伟大的自然改造者——米丘林”，读了好几遍，开始琢磨着：米丘林只有高小程度，就能改造自然，为苏联人民创造了那么大的幸福，自己的文化水平也和米丘林当时的差不多，为什么不能像米丘林那样呢？他决心向米丘林学习。他阅读米丘林的许多著作，和一些农业科学技术书籍。1954年，他就决定回农村去当一个米丘林的学生。
    但是，曾经介绍他来上海工作的叔父胡启海（是上海电车公司的老职员）不同意他的这个作法，他说：“在上海过得好好的，为什么要回去呢？种田，老黄牛翻土块，有什么出息！”
    他耐心地给叔父解释说：“我只有高小程度的知识，这在上海说来算什么呢？要是回到农村，倒算是一个知识青年；好好学习米丘林推广农业科学技术，将来一定有前途的！”
    “傻孩子！全世界只有一个米丘林，你怎么能够学他呢？”
      “米丘林是一个人，我也是一个人，他能够研究出东西来，我为什么不能够呢？再说，米丘林研究东西是处在没有人支持的沙皇时代，我是处在毛泽东时代，这个条件好得多了。”
    叔父带着严肃的神情说：“真是年青人不懂事！别人都说农村苦，要到城里来，你却要回农村学习什么米丘林。你父亲种田吃了一辈子苦了，你为什么还要去受苦呢？”
      “为了发展生产，建设社会主义新农村，吃苦算什么！”胡迪松激动地说：“刘胡兰、董存瑞为了人类的幸福，还牺牲了生命呢！没有这些先烈，就没有今天，今天的青年不去吃苦，就没有幸福的明天！”
    “哼！说到那里去了……”叔父听的不耐烦，阴沉着脸，出去了。
    初到家乡
    胡迪松考虑，回乡参加农业生产要想得到叔父的同意是困难的。他悄悄地回去了。
    家乡的人听说胡迪松回来，都去探望——看一看从上海回来的人是怎样的。只见他穿着破旧的衣服，土著的鞋子，行李简单到只有一个旧木箱子。……这一切都不像从大城市出来的人。副乡长胡东元瞅了一眼，皱眉说：
    “出去这么些年，就带这一点东西回来？铺盖、衣服呢？”
    “都撂在上海了，只背着一箱子书回来。”他高兴地指着那个旧木箱子说。
    胡东元和大家都笑起来。背地里，他们议论这个青年是不是得了神经病。年迈的父亲，看见儿子这副样子，什么都没有说，只是摇头叹气。这一切，胡迪松满不在乎，他兴致勃勃地参加了青年互助组。
    但是，干了几天活，胡迪松有点吃不消。夜里，他浑身疲劳不堪；肩膀给担子压得肿起两片红疙瘩，他用手轻轻碰一下，痛得挺难受，他真是害怕再挑担子，甚至干其他的活也有些畏惧。他怀疑自己能否这样吃苦下去了。在上海的时候，他对于回来吃苦，是作了思想准备的，他相信自己一定能够吃苦，可是，现在到了实际场合为什么吃不了苦呢？既然吃不了苦，怎么谈得上推广农业科学技术呢？……这一天晚上，他已经很累，眼睛也睁不开，可是不知因为什么缘故，他又睡不着。他走到书箱跟前，找一本红军长征故事来阅读。他被里面的事迹深深吸引住。他把目前的吃苦和红军爬雪山过草地的吃苦作了对比……他感觉脸孔一阵热辣辣。
    经过几个月的锻炼，胡迪松吃住苦了，各种活儿都能干了。
    大胆实行技术改革
    一年以后，胡迪松参加了幸福高级合作社。他专心致意于实现原来的愿望——在田间休息的时候，或晚上睡觉以前，他结合实际生产经验，孜孜不倦地研究米丘林的著作，和一些农业科学技术书籍，并且开始进行小规模的技术改革试验。
    1956年春天，胡迪松从镇上买回三斤马铃薯。人们以为他是买来吃的哩，等到听说他是买来种的，笑起来了：“这里从来没有种过马铃薯，你怎么想到种这个东西呢？种不活的，傻子！”但是，他根据书上介绍马铃薯的种植方法，以及和老农研究结果，把马铃薯种下不久，长起来了。他同样根据书本的知识，结合老农的经验，试种四川榨菜和河南生姜等也长起来了。
    作物没有到成熟期，看不到它的收获成绩，人们都瞧不起胡迪松这个技术改革试验。胡迪松满不在乎，脑子里又在考虑继续搞点别的技术改革试验。
    这天，胡迪松向着塆子附近的一片荒山走去。山并不高。山顶有几十亩平畈；黄澄澄的土地，寸草不生。胡迪松在这里走着想着：塆子里人稠地狭，如果把这一片土地种上东西，多么好啊！之后，他阅读有关土壤问题的书籍，晓得这荒山所以长不了东西，是土质太粘，如果把生土挖松，风化，掺上一层熟土，就可以长东西了——根据社里的需要，他计划种上棉花。他把这个作法和县农业局的技术人员研究，他们说可以试试看。但是，他把这个作法和社干部研究时，他们都摇头摆手说：“荒山种棉花？从来没有听过，荒唐………”胡迪松却并不灰心，他从县农业局搞到二十五棵棉苗种在荒山试验。棉苗长得非常茁壮。上级积极支持胡迪松的这个技术改革。管理委员会便决定在荒山作小规模的植棉试验。
    秋季，社里的一季晚粳稻非常缺肥。胡迪松看见报纸介绍颗粒肥的良好的肥效，简单的制法和低廉的成本，建议管理委员会让他制造颗粒肥解决晚粳稻的缺肥问题。管理委员会不相信颗粒肥的效力，他们劝告胡迪松莫操这个心思。
    胡迪松私自做了一点颗粒肥施在一蔸秧苗里，过了两天，这蔸秧苗比别的秧苗长得特别好。社委们注意起来了。社主任胡东元给二队长胡启山说：“看来颗粒肥还不坏，你们队上敢不敢使用？”胡启山?了?眼睛，说：“我们不信这个邪；不过，试一试也可！”试验的结果，秧苗的确长得特别好。各队都争着要用颗粒肥，在管理委员会的协助下，胡迪松做了一万八千斤颗粒肥满足各队的要求。
    秋收到了。胡迪松没有想到一年来的技术改革获得这样大的效果，上了颗粒肥的一百八十亩一季晚粳稻，平均单位面积产量八百斤（未上颗粒肥的只有六、七百斤），节约肥料投资一千七百四十六元（折合购买饼肥计算的）；在荒山种的三亩棉花，平均单位面积产量一百零七斤（皮棉），比一般田地的棉花增产四、五倍；马铃薯、榨菜、生姜等也获得丰收。
    同妻子的一场斗争
    技术改革取得成绩，胡迪松非常高兴。但是，想到不久以前和妻子因为对农村的前途认识不一致而发生的一场激烈的思想斗争，以致家庭不和睦，他心中沉甸甸了。
    事情是这样引起来的：春天，乡里在汉口当临时工的工人经常回来。他们头戴呢子帽，身穿卡其棉大衣，足穿新皮鞋。人们看见他们这样阔气，都羡慕到城市当工人。胡迪松的妻子高玉梅，一个爱面子的性情刚强的青年妇女，看见自己的爱人穿的破破烂烂，吃的也不好，就劝他说：
    “在农村没有什么前途，趁早到城市当工人吧！”
    “嘿！我从城市出来的，还不知道工人的生活？从表面看，比在农村过得好一点，实际上除了各项开支，也不会比在农村好多少，别给他们那种阔气的打扮糊住了。”胡迪松说。
    “说是那么说，你在农村住下去究竟有什么前途呢？”
    “我搞技术改革，提高生产，办好合作社，建设社会主义新农村，这就是前途！”
    “这个前途，几时才看得见？你还是出去当工人吧——你出去，不寄钱回来也没关系，我干活可以顾住自己。”
    “不，我要搞技术改革；我相信一定会搞成功的！”
    “这是幻想，人们都在嘲笑你搞‘歪事’呢！”
    “嘲笑又有什么关系。”
    “这是没出息！”
    “瞧不起在农村的人才是没出息！”胡迪松火了，气呼呼地说。
    “你要是不出去，我就不干活，和你离婚！”高玉梅也火了，气呼呼地说。
    从此以后，夫妇的感情不大好，见面不多说话，胡迪松有时回家晚了，她不给他留饭，胡迪松换下的衣服，她不给他洗……。
    夜话
    胡迪松的技术改革成功后，社里非常重视。秋收以后，胡迪松以一个普通社员和普通共青团员的身份，先后当选了社的技术股长、监察主任、共青团分支书记、青年先进生产者和黄陂县甲等劳动模范（出席了湖北省劳模大会）等。
    许多人都在羡慕胡迪松，连自己的妻子也不例外。——这从她的眼光，她的微笑，她的声调，完全看得出来。他决定和妻子好好谈一次话。
    这天晚上，窗外的月亮高高的挂在天空，月亮底下，云走得飞快。胡迪松瞅了瞅妻子，柔和地说：
    “你现在觉得农村的前途怎样？还要我到城市当工人吗？”
    妻子抬起乌溜溜的眼睛瞅他，抿着嘴巴笑，半晌，徐徐地说：
    “现在嘛，当然……情况不一样……”
    “什么情况不一样？”
    妻子又抿着嘴巴笑，轻轻地说：
    “瞧你！你技术改革成功了，帮助社里提高生产了，获得许多荣誉了，人们都瞧得起你了——从你的身上，就看出农村的前途——青年人满好的前途！”
    胡迪松的脸上快活得放光。高玉梅接着说：
    “现在我不仅不让你到城市当工人，我自己也要努力干活。我要不是前些时心情不好，少出了工，我们今年的收入还要比现在增加得多哩。”（附图片）
