Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The State Council Standing Committee meeting held on September 4th discussed the "Report on the Current Situation of Gold Production and Opinions on Future Development of Gold Production" submitted by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the People's Bank of China. Based on this, the State Council decided to vigorously restore and develop gold production in the future, and issued instructions for this matter.

The State Council's instructions first pointed out that gold production was one of China's relatively established production sectors in the past. In recent years, due to the lack of unified planning and organizational leadership by the state for gold production, and due to unclear resources and high gold mining costs, gold production has been shrinking. In order to meet the needs of industrial production development and increase the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, it is necessary to vigorously restore and develop gold production in the future, and take all necessary measures in all aspects to strive for a large increase in gold production.

The instructions stipulated that the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission should include gold production as one of the main production indicators of the state; provinces and autonomous regions should lead gold production as an important production undertaking and complete gold production tasks on time. Vein gold mines with rich reserves and high grades should be operated by the province as local state-owned enterprises; small gold mining enterprises can be managed by the county. The investment required for restoring old mines or opening up new mines can be allocated from the budget after review by the central government.

The instructions emphasized that mobilizing the masses and organizing them to engage in gold mining and panning is a reliable method for developing gold production at present. In areas where conditions permit, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to engage in gold mining production. Due to the high cost of gold mining by the masses, the state is prepared to provide necessary subsidies. The funds needed by mass-organized gold mining can be applied for loans. Mining areas that were previously charged rent according to state regulations or designated as state-protected areas and prohibited from mining can be exempted from rent or have the ban lifted by the provincial people's committee based on its necessity, allowing the masses to produce.

The instructions required banks to strengthen the acquisition of gold produced by the masses. In gold-producing areas, county branches of the People's Bank of China should be equipped with gold-collecting tools and technical personnel, and organize regular on-site acquisitions to facilitate the masses.

The instructions required strengthening geological exploration of gold resources. In addition to organizing mass reporting of mines and prospecting, the Geological Department and the geological bureaus of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry stationed in various provinces were specifically designated to assist local governments in exploring for gold. Provinces should give certain material rewards to the people who have made certain achievements in reporting and prospecting for mines.

In order to encourage gold production, the State Council also decided that all gold production is exempt from taxes.

The instructions finally required relevant provinces and autonomous regions to vigorously lead and organize this work, and provide all convenient conditions. In key gold-producing provinces, special districts, and counties, in order to manage gold production well, special agencies can be established or specific personnel designated to be responsible for this work.

    适应工业需要  增加外汇储备
    国务院决定大力开采黄金
    强调要发动和组织群众挖金淘金
    黄金生产一律免税群众报矿给予奖励
    新华社7日讯　9月4日举行的国务院常务会议，讨论了冶金工业部和中国人民银行“关于目前黄金生产情况及今后发展黄金生产的意见的报告”。据此，国务院决定今后大力恢复和发展黄金生产，并且为这件事发布了指示。
    国务院的指示首先指出，黄金生产过去曾是我国较有基础的生产事业之一。近年来，由于国家对黄金生产缺乏统一的规划和组织领导，又由于资源不清，采金成本较高，黄金生产是萎缩的。为了适应工业生产发展的需要和增加积累外汇储备的途径，今后要大力恢复和发展黄金生产，在各方面采取一切必要的措施，争取大量增产黄金。
    指示中规定：今后国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会要把黄金生产列为国家的主要生产指标之一下达；各省、自治区要把黄金生产作为一项重要的生产事业来领导，按时完成黄金生产任务。储量富、品位高的脉金矿，应当做为地方国营企业，由省经营；小型的采金企业可以交县管理。为恢复旧矿或开辟新矿所需的投资，经过中央审核，可以从预算中拨给。
    指示着重指出，发动群众，组织群众从事挖金、淘金，是目前发展黄金生产的可靠方法。在有条件的地方，要大力发动和组织群众从事采金生产。由于群众采金成本较高，国家准备予以必要的补贴。群众组织采金所缺少的资金，可以申请贷款。过去按国家规定收取租金的矿区或列为国家保护区禁止开采的矿区，可以由省人民委员会按照它的必要性，决定免除租金或者开禁，让群众生产。
    指示要求银行加强对群众生产的黄金的收购工作。在产金地区，人民银行县支行要配备收金工具和技术人员，组织定期的就地收购，以便利群众。
    指示要求加强黄金资源的地质勘探工作。除了组织群众性的报矿、找矿外，特别指定地质部和冶金工业部分驻各省的地质局协助地方勘探黄金。各省对报矿、探矿获有一定成绩的人民群众，要给予一定的物质奖励。
    为了鼓励黄金生产，国务院还决定：黄金生产一律免税。
    指示最后要求有关省、自治区大力领导和组织这个工作，给予一切方便条件。在重点的产金省、专区和县，为了把黄金生产管理好，可以设立专职机构或者指定专人负责这个工作。
