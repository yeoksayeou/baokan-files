    Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Bulgarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement

    The Chinese people have deep sympathy for the Bulgarian people's revolutionary struggles over the years and a strong interest in the cultural heritage that reflects these struggles. The poems of the 19th-century Bulgarian revolutionary poet Botev and the great writer Vazov's "Under the Yoke" once inspired the people of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China. At the same time, the Bulgarian people have also shown keen interest in the Chinese people's revolutionary struggles and long-standing culture.

    The liberation of September 9, 1944, opened up broad avenues for the cultural development of Bulgaria. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the cultural ties between China and Bulgaria, established on a new foundation, have seen tremendous development in recent years. The cultural cooperation agreements signed between China and Bulgaria since 1952 are a significant sign of the increasingly close cultural ties between the two countries. In 1953, the two sides signed the "Sino-Bulgarian Radio Cooperation Agreement," and in 1955, the "Sino-Bulgarian Film Purchase and Distribution Rights Contract" and the "Sino-Bulgarian Newsreel Footage Exchange Contract."

    The modes of Sino-Bulgarian cultural cooperation are extensive and diverse, including mutual visits and performances by cultural and scientific groups and individuals, the holding of exhibitions, and the exchange of students. Among these, cultural groups and representatives from the cultural sector visiting each other under the two countries' cultural cooperation plans alone have numbered more than thirty on each side over the past seven years.

    The China Youth Art Troupe and the China Art Troupe visited Bulgaria in 1952 and 1955, respectively. In 1954, our country hosted the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble. These large performing groups had extensive contact with the people and left a deep impression.

    Well-known writers, artists, scientists, and journalists from both sides have made frequent mutual visits. During their visits, writers and artists collected rich creative materials and, after returning home, vividly introduced to their own people the other country's socialist construction and people's lives. At the same time, the artists also introduced their country's artistic achievements to the people of the other country. The world-renowned bass singer Popov and the pianist Bulkov, who has won three awards in international piano competitions, attracted Chinese audiences with their superb skills during their visits and performances in China. In February of this year, the Bulgarian Artists Delegation performed 33 shows in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places, receiving high praise.

    Bulgarian artists who have visited our country have expressed great interest in China's long-standing traditional Chinese painting, ancient and folk sculptures and prints, ancient patterns, and classical dramas.

    Mutual visits by scientists have played a positive role in exchanging scientific achievements between the two countries. Academician Daskalov, an agricultural scientist from Bulgaria, and agricultural expert Popov brought back many seeds from China, some of which have blossomed and borne fruit on Bulgarian soil. At the same time, Bulgaria's valuable experience in plant protection and fruit and vegetable cultivation has provided us with great assistance.

    We have held various exhibitions in Bulgaria, the most important of which were the exhibitions participating in the 1952, 1955, and 1956 Plovdiv International Fairs and the 1954 Folk Crafts Exhibition. In 1955, the "Folk Art Exhibition of the People's Republic of Bulgaria" was held in China, and the unique national style of the exhibits was warmly praised by our country's arts and crafts artists.

    In addition, both sides have held many mass commemorative meetings. Our country has successively commemorated the outstanding Bulgarian poets and writers Botev, Vazov, Smirnenski, and Vaptsarov. Bulgaria has also held gatherings to commemorate Qu Yuan and Lu Xun.

    In terms of translation and publication, both sides have published thirty to forty books from the other side. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volumes 1 to 3, have long been translated into Bulgarian and published. "Selected Works of Dimitrov" has been published in China in two different translations. Both sides have also translated and screened many films from the other side and have held two film weeks of the other side.

    By 1956, our country had sent 36 students to study in Bulgaria; the Bulgarian side sent 10 students to study in our country.

    The facts of the five years since the signing of the Sino-Bulgarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement prove that the cultural ties between China and Bulgaria have contributed to deepening the mutual understanding between the two peoples and promoting the fraternal friendship between the two countries. We firmly believe that in the future, this connection will be further developed on the existing basis.

    纪念中保文化合作协定签订五周年

    中国人民对保加利亚人民多年来的革命斗争怀着深切的同情，对反映保加利亚人民革命斗争的文化遗产有着浓厚的兴趣。十九世纪保加利亚革命诗人保泰夫的诗句和伟大作家瓦佐夫的“轭下”，曾经鼓舞了半殖民地半封建中国的人民。同时，保加利亚人民对中国人民的革命斗争和悠久文化也寄予了亲切的关怀。
    1944年9月9日的解放为保加利亚的文化发展开辟了广阔的道路。中华人民共和国成立后，在新的基础上建立起来的中保两国的文化联系，几年来得到了巨大的发展。1952年以来中保双方签订的文化合作协定，是两国文化联系日益密切的显著标志。双方在1953年签订了“中保广播电台合作协定”、1955年签订了“中保互购影片发行权合同”和“中保互换新闻片素材合同”。
    中保文化合作的方式是广泛而多样的，包括文化、科学团体和个人的互相访问、演出，互相举办展览会和互派留学生等等。其中仅根据两国文化合作计划到对方访问的文化团体和文化界代表，七年多以来就各有三十余起之多。
    中国青年文工团和中国艺术团先后于1952、1955年访问了保加利亚。1954年，我国接待了保加利亚人民军歌舞团。这些人数众多的表演团体与人民群众进行了广泛的接触，留下了极深的印象。
    双方著名的作家、艺术家、科学家、新闻界人士进行了频繁的相互访问。作家和画家们在访问期间收集了丰富的创作材料，回国后向本国人民生动地介绍了对方的社会主义建设和人民生活。同时，艺术家们还向对方的人民介绍了本国的艺术成就。世界闻名的男低音歌唱家波波夫以及曾三次在国际钢琴比赛会获奖的钢琴家布尔柯夫等，在我国访问演出期间以精湛的技巧吸引了中国的观众。今年2月保加利亚艺术家代表团在广州、上海等地演出三十三场，获得了很高的评价。
    曾来我国访问的保加利亚艺术家，对我国有悠久历史传统的国画、古代及民间雕塑和版画、古代图案、古典戏剧等，感到很大兴趣。
    科学家的互相访问对交流两国科学成就起了积极作用。保加利亚农业科学家达斯卡洛夫院士和农业专家波波夫从我国带回去的许多种子，有的已在保加利亚的土地上开花结果。同时，保加利亚在植物保护、果蔬栽培方面的宝贵经验，给了我们很大的帮助。
    我们在保加利亚举行过各种展览会，其中最重要的有参加1952、1955和1956年普罗夫迪夫国际博览会的展览和1954年的民间工艺品展览。1955年在中国举行了“保加利亚人民共和国民间创作展览”，展品的独特民族风格受到了我国工艺美术家的热烈赞扬。
    此外，双方还举行了许多群众性的纪念会。我国先后纪念了保加利亚的卓越诗人和作家保泰夫、瓦佐夫、斯米尔宁斯基和瓦普察洛夫。保加利亚也举行了纪念屈原和鲁迅的集会。
    在翻译出版方面，双方均曾出版对方书籍三、四十种。“毛泽东选集”一至三卷早已译为保文出版。“季米特洛夫选集”在中国出版了两种不同的译本。双方还译制和放映了对方的许多影片，并相互举办了两次对方的电影周。
    到1956年为止，我国派出了三十六名留学生赴保加利亚学习；保方派到我国来学习的留学生为十名。
    中保文化合作协定签订五年来的事实证明，中保两国的文化联系已对加深两国人民的互相了解和促进两国人民的兄弟友谊作出贡献。我们深信，今后这种联系将在已有基础上获得进一步的发展。
