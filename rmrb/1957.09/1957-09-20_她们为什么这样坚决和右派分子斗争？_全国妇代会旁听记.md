Why are they so determined to fight the rightists?
　　——Notes from the National Women's Congress
　　By Our Correspondent Zhang Shihong

    Why do the broad masses of women resolutely oppose the rightists? The vast majority of the delegates attending this conference can answer this question with their own experiences.

    Chinese women are in a new era. The benefits that the Communist Party and socialism have brought to Chinese women are particularly profound, and it is almost difficult to find a suitable analogy. However, the rightists are not reconciled to the death of the old society and are doing everything possible to oppose socialism. Because of this, the delegates strongly requested to talk about their past and present at the conference. The sharp contrast between the past and the present cannot be concealed by the rightists.

    It has been eight years since liberation, and some representatives still cannot help but shed tears when recalling their lives eight years ago. In her speech, Buddhist representative Shi Bo depicted a miserable scene in Beijing thirteen years ago: "At that time, a cornbread cost two cents, but it quickly rose to twenty cents. Rickshaw pullers often fainted on the road due to hunger. Many children were so hungry that their necks were thin and long like swans. Twenty or thirty people surrounded a food stall, drooling and even begging the owner for some dishwashing water to drink. A post office employee's family of nine could only eat a ball of tofu dregs a day. Across from Tongjiao Temple, a family was so desperate that they sold their only old quilt, bought a package of opium, and committed suicide. As a result, two of the three mothers and children died. Japanese militarism even used large trucks to carry poor people to the wilderness and dump them there. People couldn't climb back and starved to death...". The situation in the countryside was equally miserable. Zhou Tongxiang, the director of the Nansucun Cooperative in Yexian County, Shandong Province, said that their village had five "manys" before liberation: many beggars, many long-term laborers, many people fleeing famine, many people who couldn't afford cotton clothes, and many single men. Due to hunger, the locust and elm leaves and flowers in the village were all eaten. At that time, the fate of Chinese working women was not much different from that of livestock. Wang Tonghui, who is now a planer in the General Mechanical Room of the Daye Steel Plant in Hubei, was sold by her family to a landlord as a child bride at the age of nine because she couldn't survive. She said that at that time, she ate leftovers and slept at the mouth of the stove with the dog. She had to get up before dawn to cook and herd cattle. The landlord would beat her with a pole if he was not happy. Ma Zhuxuan, deputy director of the Gansu Women's Federation, said that in the past, being a slave of landlords and bureaucrats and being arbitrarily occupied by landlords was the common fate of many Hui working women. Many women committed suicide by jumping into wells or hanging themselves because they could not bear the torture and humiliation... As for urban female workers, as Zhang Ren, chairman of the Jiangsu Textile Trade Union, said, they were the cheapest labor force exploited by capitalists. They worked from dawn to late at night every day but could not maintain their minimum living standards, and they were often insulted.

    This era of treating women as slaves is gone forever.

    Since liberation, the face of Chinese women has undergone fundamental changes. First of all, the vast majority of women have achieved economic independence. Many representatives pointed out in their speeches that after the implementation of advanced cooperatives in rural areas, women's economic status has become increasingly important. In rural Shanxi, almost all female labor is now invested in agricultural and sideline production. Two sentences are circulating in rural Zhejiang: "If men work but women don't, the plan is difficult to realize; if men and women work together, the soil is more valuable than gold." Shen Jilan, deputy director of the Jinxing Cooperative in Shanxi, said in her speech that the phenomenon of treating men and women differently in life no longer exists in their cooperative. In 1956, more than 93% of the households in the entire cooperative increased their income, of which the income increased by women participating in labor accounted for 40% of the total increased income. At the 1956 harvest evaluation conference of the entire cooperative, 176 labor models emerged, half of whom were women.

    The economic situation of urban female workers has also changed significantly. Representative Zhang Ren cited Changzhou Minfeng Textile Factory in Jiangsu as a representative example. Before liberation, the average annual salary per person in this factory was 256.19 yuan; in 1956, it was 841.4 yuan, an increase of more than two times. The wages of the silk reeling factories there have increased even faster, generally increasing four to seven times. Some female workers' children are now in college, which was unimaginable in the past.

    With the improvement of economic status, the social and political status of the broad masses of working women has also been unprecedentedly improved. Please take a look at some convincing figures listed in the representatives' speeches: 160,000 women in Shanxi have taken on various leadership positions in agricultural cooperatives. In Zhejiang last year, more than half of the agricultural cooperatives in the province elected female chairpersons; 1,241 women were elected as township heads and deputy township heads; and 2,238 women were elected as county (city) people's representatives. In Jiangsu Province, female workers account for more than half of the total number of trade union cadres and activists in the textile industry, of which female workers promoted to enterprise management cadres last year accounted for 31.1% of the total number of promoted cadres.

    The strength of ethnic minority women cannot be ignored either. At the conference, many ethnic minority women made wonderful speeches, which proved that they had also been emancipated. Qu Bi'a Zhi, a representative of the Yi people in Liangshan, Sichuan, said that the Yi people have directly entered socialism from a slave society. Yi women, together with men, overthrew the slave system and were allocated land and means of production. The liberated slaves had freedom of marriage for the first time.

    In the past eight years, a large number of advanced women have emerged on all fronts. They are not only role models for women, but also role models for men. At this conference, there was Liu Ying, an advanced combine operator from the Beidahuang State-owned Friendship Farm. Last year, the locomotive team led by Liu Ying overcame various difficulties, modified the machine, and overfulfilled the harvesting task of 407 hectares. There was Tang Fenglan, a female worker from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Large Plant who was elected as an advanced producer in the class for ten consecutive months. There was Huang Shijiu, who served as the third mate of the Huayuan Wheel on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and formally participated in driving the ship. There was Ran Huilin, the head of the business group of the Second Sales Department of the Wanzhou Department Store Branch in Sichuan, who eliminated more than 99% of the errors in the accounts. There are more than tens of millions of such advanced women among the working women of the whole country.

    All of these fully demonstrate the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party and the superiority of the socialist system. The rightists' attempt to ignite a fire among the broad masses of working women is doomed to fail miserably.

    Defending the Communist Party, defending socialism, and defending the position of Chinese women as masters of their own affairs should not only be a slogan, but should also be put into action. The current task of the women's community, as Comrade Zhang Yun pointed out in her report, is to pass the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and to transform old ideas so that they adapt to the new system. The representatives from all walks of life expressed this wish in their speeches: on the one hand, actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle; on the other hand, actively demand to transform their own thinking.

　　她们为什么这样坚决和右派分子斗争？
　　——全国妇代会旁听记
　　本报记者　章世鸿
    为什么广大妇女坚决地反对右派？参加这次大会的绝大部分代表都可以用亲身体验来回答这个问题。
    中国妇女正处在新时代。共产党和社会主义带给中国妇女的好处特别深切，几乎很难找到一个适当的比喻，而右派分子却不甘心旧社会的死亡，千方百计地反对社会主义。就因为这样，代表们强烈地要求在大会上谈一谈自己的过去和现在。过去和现在的鲜明的对比，右派分子是无法掩盖的。
    解放已经八年，有的代表在回想到八年前的生活时，仍不免激动得流下泪来。佛教界代表逝波的发言中描摹了十三年前北京城的一副凄惨的景象：“当时，二分钱一个窝窝头，很快上涨到两毛。拉洋车的常饿得晕倒在路上，许多孩子，饿得脖子细长像天鹅；小食摊上一人吃饭，四周围上二、三十人垂涎三尺，甚至哀告老板给点刷锅水喝；一个邮局职员，九口之家一天一人只能吃一团豆腐渣；在通教寺对门有一人家，实在活不下去，卖了唯一的一床旧被，买一包鸦片烟喝了自杀，结果母子三人死了两人；日本军国主义还曾用大汽车将穷人载到荒郊抛下，人爬不回来，就饿死在那里……。”农村的情况同样凄惨，山东省掖县南宿村合作社社长周同香说她们村子中，解放前有五多：讨饭的多，扛长活的多，逃荒的多，穿不上棉衣的多，光棍多。由于饥饿，村中洋槐、榆树的叶和花都被人吃光了。那时中国劳动妇女的命运和畜牲相差不远，现任湖北大冶钢厂总机械室刨工的王通慧就是因为活不下去，在九岁那年被家里人卖给地主家做童养媳，她说，当时她吃的是剩菜剩饭，夜晚睡在灶门口和狗一起，天不亮就得起来做饭、放牛。地主一不顺心，就拿篙子打她。甘肃妇联副主任马竹轩说，过去当地主、官僚的奴婢，被地主任意霸占是许多回族劳动妇女的共同的命运。许多妇女因为挨不住折磨和侮辱而投井或上吊自杀……。至于城市女工，正如江苏纺织工会主席张韧所说，那是受资本家剥削的最低廉的劳动力，她们每天从鸡叫做到深夜还不能维持自己最低的生活，而且还经常被侮辱。
    这个将妇女当做奴隶的时代已经一去不复返了。
    解放以来，中国妇女的面貌发生了根本的变化。首先绝大多数妇女取得了经济上的独立地位。许多代表在发言中指出，在农村实行高级合作化后，妇女的经济地位愈来愈显得重要。山西农村中现在几乎全部妇女劳动力都投入了农业和副业生产。浙江农村中流传着这样两句话：“男干女不干，计划难实现；男女齐上阵，泥土比黄金”。山西金星合作社副社长申纪兰发言中说，在她们的合作社内，男女在生活上两样看待的现象已不存在了。1956年全社有93％以上的户都增加了收入，其中妇女参加劳动增加的收入占整个增产收入的40％。1956年全社丰收评比大会上，涌现了一百七十六个劳动模范，其中妇女就占了半数。
    城市女工的经济情况也有显著改变。张韧代表发言中举出江苏有代表性的常州民丰纺织厂为例，这个厂解放前每人每年平均工资是二百五十六点一九元；1956年则是八百四十一点四元，增加了二倍多。那里的缫丝厂的工资增加得更快，一般增加四倍到七倍。有的女工的子弟，现在上了大学，这是过去做梦也想不到的。
    随着经济地位的提高，广大劳动妇女的社会地位和政治地位也空前提高，请看一看代表发言中所列举的一些具有极大说服力的数字：山西有十六万妇女担任了农业社的各项领导工作。浙江去年全省有一半以上农业社选出了女社长；一千二百四十一个妇女当选了正副乡长；二千二百三十八个妇女当选县（市）人民代表。江苏全省纺织产业工会干部和积极分子中，女职工占总数一半以上，其中去年被提拔为企业管理干部的女职工占整个被提拔的干部的31.1％。
    也不能忽视少数民族妇女的力量。在大会上，不少少数民族妇女作了精彩的发言，这些发言证明她们也已经翻身了。四川凉山彝族代表曲比阿支说，彝族已从奴隶社会直接进入到社会主义。彝族妇女和男子一起推翻了奴隶制度，分得了土地和生产资料。解放出来的奴隶破天荒第一次有了婚姻自由。
    八年来，在各条战线上涌现了大批先进妇女，她们不但是妇女们的榜样，也是男子们的榜样。在这次大会上，就有北大荒国营友谊农场先进的康拜因手刘瑛，去年刘瑛所领导的机车组克服了种种困难，改装了机器，超额完成了四百零七公顷的收割任务；有连续十一个月当选为班的先进生产者的鞍钢大型厂女工唐凤兰；有担任长江上游华源轮的三副，正式参加驾驶轮船的黄式玖；有消灭账货上差错99％以上的四川万县百货支公司第二门市部营业组组长冉惠林，像这样的先进妇女，在全国劳动妇女中何止千万。
    所有这些，充分说明了共产党领导的正确，说明了社会主义制度的优越，右派分子想在广大劳动妇女中点火，注定要碰得头破血流。
    保卫共产党，保卫社会主义，保卫中国妇女主人翁的地位，不能只是一句口号，而应该有行动。当前妇女界的任务正如章蕴同志在报告中所指出的，是要在政治战线和思想战线上过好社会主义革命这一关；是要改造旧思想，使思想适应新制度。各界代表在发言中共同表示了这个望愿：一方面积极参加反右派斗争；另一方面则积极要求改造自己的思想。
