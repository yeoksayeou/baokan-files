Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming Vice President Vukmanović is as follows:

Comrade Vice President Vukmanović, Yugoslav comrades, comrades and friends:

Comrade Vukmanović and his entourage have come to our country after visiting some Asian countries and our fraternal country, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Today, we are gathering here with joy to celebrate with them. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, to extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the fraternal Yugoslav people, Comrade Vukmanović, and the Yugoslav comrades who have come with him.

Dear distinguished guests, your friendly visit to our country has brought the profound friendship of the Yugoslav people to the Chinese people, a friendship that has long existed between our two peoples. The Chinese and Yugoslav peoples had already extended sympathy and concern to each other during the years of their respective struggles for democracy, freedom, and liberation. The glorious revolutionary fighting tradition of the Yugoslav people and their heroic anti-fascist fighting spirit during World War II were a powerful encouragement and support to the Chinese people who were then engaged in the struggle for liberation. We have also followed with the same concern the efforts made by the Yugoslav people in building their own socialist motherland.

In recent years, the friendly relations between our two countries have been continuously developing. Both sides have sent many delegations to pay friendly visits to each other. It is particularly worth mentioning that in January this year, the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country headed by Comrade Peng Zhen visited the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and was warmly welcomed, and in a few days, the delegation of the Yugoslav National Assembly will also visit our country. Economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries is also developing. This friendship and cooperation is built on the common goal of our two peoples in building socialism and defending world peace, and is therefore precious. We attach great importance to the growing fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples, and are willing to continue our efforts to strengthen and develop the friendly cooperation between our two countries. Dear Comrade Vice President, I believe that your visit to our country will make a beneficial contribution to further enhancing the long-standing friendship between our two peoples and deepening our mutual understanding.

I wish you and all the accompanying Yugoslav comrades a successful visit.

I propose a toast:

To the prosperity and strength of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia!

To the further consolidation and development of friendly relations between China and Yugoslavia!

To the friendly unity between the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!

To world peace, to the health of Comrade Vice President Vukmanović!

To the health of Comrade Tito, President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia!

Cheers!

　　周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社12日讯　周恩来总理在欢迎伏克曼诺维奇副主席宴会上的讲话，全文如下：伏克曼诺维奇副主席同志，南斯拉夫同志们，同志们和朋友们：
    伏克曼诺维奇同志和他的随行人员，在访问了亚洲一些国家和我们的兄弟之邦越南民主共和国之后来到了我国。今天，我们怀着愉快的心情同他们欢聚一堂。首先，请允许我代表中国政府和中国人民向兄弟的南斯拉夫人民的代表、伏克曼诺维奇同志和随同他前来的南斯拉夫同志们，表示热烈的欢迎。
    亲爱的贵宾们，你们这次来到我国进行友好访问，给中国人民带来了南斯拉夫人民的深厚友谊，这种友谊在我们两国人民之间早已存在了。中南两国人民远在各自进行争取民主、自由、解放的斗争的年代里，就曾经相互寄予同情和关怀。南斯拉夫人民光荣的革命战斗传统和在第二次世界大战期间反法西斯的英勇斗争精神，对于当时正在从事解放斗争的中国人民是一个有力的鼓舞和支持。我们曾经以同样关切的心情注视着南斯拉夫人民在建设自己的社会主义祖国方面所作的努力。
    近年来，我们两国之间的友好关系得到了不断的发展。双方派出了许多代表团互相进行友好访问。特别值得指出的，今年1月间以彭真同志为首的我国人民代表大会代表团访问了南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国，受到了热烈的欢迎，而过几天以后南斯拉夫国民议会代表团也将来我国访问。我们两国之间的经济和文化合作也正在发展。这种友谊和合作是建筑在我们两国人民建设社会主义和捍卫世界和平的共同目标的基础之上的，因而是可贵的。我们很重视中南两国人民之间日益发展着的兄弟友谊，并且愿意继续努力来加强和发展我们两国的友好合作关系。亲爱的副主席同志，我相信，你这次访问我国对于进一步增进我们两国人民之间久已存在的友谊和加深我们相互之间的了解，将作出有益的贡献。
　　我预祝你和随行的南斯拉夫全体同志们这次访问的成功。
　　我提议：
　　为南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的繁荣和富强，
　　为中南两国友好关系的进一步巩固和发展，
　　为以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的友好团结，
　　为世界和平，为伏克曼诺维奇副主席同志的健康，
　　为南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托同志的健康，
　　干杯。
