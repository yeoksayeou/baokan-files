Both sides unanimously expressed their opposition to the testing and use of thermonuclear weapons.

The communiqué stated that the People's Republic of Mongolia supports the convening of the Second Asian-African Conference, suggests discussing issues related to maintaining world peace and international security, and supports India's policy of recovering Goa. India expressed its agreement with Mongolia's policy of developing Far Eastern cooperation and agrees with Mongolia's preparations to establish normal relations with Japan.

The communiqué stated that both sides believe that the People's Republic of China, which plays a major role in the cause of world peace and justice, should enjoy its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 23rd - Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan said at a mass rally of Mongolian-Indian friendship held in Ulaanbaatar this morning to welcome him, that to protect ancient cultures, it is necessary to ban the testing and use of thermonuclear weapons; to make the world a peaceful world, it is necessary to eliminate colonial rule, and oppressed nations should gain independence.

When speaking about the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the Vice President said that Asians have no intention of aggressing against others, so we advocate Panchsheel and hope to extend it to every region of the world. He said that might cannot overcome justice; those who want to rule and oppress people will fail themselves.
