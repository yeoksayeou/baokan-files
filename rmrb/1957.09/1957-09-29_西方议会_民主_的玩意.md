    Western Parliamentary "Democracy" Farce
    Editor's Note: Here we have translated a report from the September 2nd issue of the American "Time" magazine, which discusses the final stages of the U.S. Congress's handling of the "Civil Rights Act." The passage of this bill was promoted as one of the major achievements of the 85th U.S. Congress. In order to win over black voters, both the Republican and Democratic parties made a big deal out of this bill; however, as can be seen from this detailed report in "Time" magazine, no one really considered the rights of black people. The so-called "Civil Rights Act," like many other similar bills, is nothing more than a plaything in the bourgeois parties' struggle for power. From this, one can also see what Western parliamentary "democracy" really is and how much it has to do with the broad masses of the people.
    House Republican Leader Martin said: "I am an old hand. When I need votes, I go and get them. But Rayburn is also an old hand, and when he needs votes, he will go and get them." Martin and Democrat Rayburn were fighting for an advantageous position and votes on the first civil rights bill since the American Civil War, with such skillful tactics that neither could gain the upper hand. As a result, after blowing their whiskers and glaring at each other for some days, these two old hands had to seek a compromise of a compromise of a compromise.
    At the beginning of this week, the situation of the struggle was as follows: The Civil Rights Act, along with the Senate's amendment to the bill—that all criminal cases should have a jury—was stranded in the House Rules Committee and needed Republican votes to be brought out. However, Martin, who was not even sure if there were any black people in his own constituency, decided to put a Republican stamp on what was then a Democratic bill. Martin said, "We have no interest in the idea of passing a Democratic bill, especially when this bill doesn't offer anything."
    Martin persuaded four Republican members of the House Rules Committee to resist the Senate bill, and then instructed Republican Congressman Keating of New York and Acting Attorney General Rogers to jointly draft the Republican opinion on the bill. Then, Martin, who routinely met with his old friend Rayburn a dozen times a day, announced that he had nothing "to talk about" with "Mr. Rayburn."
    While everyone in Congress was wondering when they would make up, the two men entered a war of nerves, with neither willing to give in. Martin said, "I wouldn't be so rash as to see the Speaker of the House about such a matter. I would be getting in other people's way." Rayburn replied, "My door is open. I am happy to receive Mr. Martin or any other member of the House." How long would this waiting game last? Martin said with a sneer, "My legs and feet are still strong!"
    Martin did not even send the proposal drafted by Keating and Rogers to Rayburn. Instead, a reporter copied it and gave it to Rayburn. Rayburn looked it over, snorted, and then read it several times. Finally, Rayburn announced, "This thing is profound, and I need some time to digest it." So he returned to his office and studied it with his four fellow Texans. The Republican "profound thing" was this: First, alleged violations of the Civil Rights Act provisions referred only to infringements of voting rights, rather than all criminal cases involving violations of civil rights, as proposed in the original Senate bill.
    Second, in criminal cases involving infringements of voting rights, federal judges would have the power to sentence imprisonment of ninety days and fines of three hundred dollars; heavier sentences would require a jury trial.
    Rayburn consulted with liberal Democrats in the North, who warned him that the Republican plan was politically difficult to oppose. One afternoon, Rayburn discussed the matter in detail with Senate Democratic Leader Johnson. They agreed that some kind of civil rights bill had to be passed by this Congress, otherwise the Democratic Party would suffer in the 1958 congressional elections. The next morning, Johnson began working on a compromise solution to the jury issue that could pass in the Senate. That evening, Johnson and Rayburn met secretly. Johnson said that in criminal cases involving infringements of voting rights, the Senate might agree that federal judges have the power to pronounce imprisonment of thirty days and fines of two hundred dollars. Anything more than that would require a jury trial.
    The next morning, Johnson made a radio call to Senate Republican Leader Knowland on his way to Congress. Knowland said, "It sounds like you're in Texas." Johnson replied, "If you agree to what I'm about to discuss with you, I can go there for vacation."
    The Senate leaders decided to hold a meeting in Knowland's office. Johnson proposed his thirty-day imprisonment, two-hundred-dollar fine proposal. Knowland made a counter-proposal of sixty days, three hundred dollars. They broke up without reaching an agreement. But both sides knew that a deal was about to be made. Then Johnson called the U.S. President. The gist of the call was: propose another suggestion, and we can probably reach an agreement. Sure enough, an opportunity soon arose. During the Senate negotiations, Knowland reduced the imprisonment period to forty-five days, and Johnson raised the fine limit to three hundred dollars.
    Minutes later, the two old leaders of the House, who were closely following the developments, finally made up. Martin rose from his minority leader's seat and walked thirty feet to the Speaker's chair. Martin and Rayburn whispered for about five minutes. Were they talking about civil rights? "Ah! No," Martin said, "We were talking about when to go home."
    Everything was ready except for the vote. That afternoon, Martin, Rayburn, Johnson, and Knowland jointly held a press conference, announcing that they had reached a compromise of a compromise of a compromise on the basis of forty-five days and three hundred dollars.

### 西方议会“民主”的玩意

    西方议会“民主”的玩意
    编者按　这里我们译出了美国“时代”周刊9月2日一期登载的一篇报道，它谈到了美国国会处理“公民权利法案”最后阶段的情况。这个法案的通过被宣传为美国第八十五届国会的主要成就之一。为了争取黑人选民，共和、民主两党都曾在这个法案上大作文章；但是从“时代”周刊的这篇详细的报道中可以看出，谁也没有真正考虑到黑人的权利，所谓“公民权利法案”，像许多其他同类性质的法案一样，不过是资产阶级党派斗争中的一个玩意。从这里也可以看出，西方的议会“民主”究竟是什么东西，它和广大人民究竟有多大关系。
    众议院共和党领袖马丁说：“我是一个老手。当我需要票数的时候，我就去找。可是雷朋也是一个老手，当他需要票数的时候，他也会去找。”马丁与民主党的雷朋，在美国南北战争以来第一个公民权利法案上抢夺有利地位，争取票数，手法都非常巧妙，以至于相持不下。结果，在相互吹胡子、瞪眼睛闹了一些日子之后，这两个老手不得不谋求一项妥协的妥协的妥协。
    本星期开始时斗争的状况如下：公民权利法案以及参议院对这个法案所作的修正——凡是刑事性质的案件应有陪审团——，在众议院程序委员会里搁了浅，需要共和党的票数把它从那里提出来。但是，连自己的选区有没有黑人都不清楚的马丁决定要在当时作为一个民主党的法案上，打上共和党的标记。马丁说：“我们毫无兴趣去想法通过一个民主党的法案，尤其是当这个法案并没有提供什么东西的时候。”
    马丁说服众议院程序委员会四名共和党议员抗住参议院的法案，又吩咐纽约州的共和党众议员凯丁与代理司法部长罗吉斯共同草拟共和党对这个法案的意见。接着，向例每天要与老朋友雷朋接头十来次的马丁宣布说，他与“雷朋先生”没有什么“可谈”的。
    当国会里每一个人都在猜想他们那一天才会言归于好时，这两个人却进入了一场神经战，谁也不愿迁就。马丁说：“我不敢那么冒失地去见众议院议长谈这样的问题。我会碍别人的手脚。”雷朋回答说：“我的大门是敞开的。我乐意接待马丁先生或其他任何一位众议员。”这一场等待的游戏要玩到什么时候呢？马丁冷笑着说：“我腰腿还健壮着哩！”
    马丁甚至不把凯丁与罗吉斯起草好了的建议送去给雷朋。倒是新闻记者抄了一份给雷朋。雷朋看了一遍，哼了一声，接着又反复地看了几遍。最后雷朋宣布说：“这个玩意很深奥，我需要一点时间来消化它。”于是他就回到办公室，伙同他的四位得克萨斯州同乡进行研究。共和党的“深奥的玩意”是这样的：一、所谓违犯公民权利法案条款，仅指侵犯投票权，而不是像参议院原来的法案所提出的，涉及所有的违反民权的刑事案件。
    二、在侵犯投票权的刑事案件上，联邦法官有权判处拘禁九十日、罚款三百元，比这更重的判刑需要通过陪审团。
    雷朋与北方的自由派民主党人商谈，这些人警告他说，共和党的计划从政治上说来，是难以反对的。有一天下午，雷朋找参议院民主党领袖约翰逊细谈了一次。他们一致认为，无论如何本届国会必须通过某种公民权利法案，否则在1958年国会选举中，民主党会要吃亏。第二天早上，约翰逊就着手研究一个在参议院通得过的、有关陪审问题的折衷方案。当晚，约翰逊与雷朋秘密会晤。约翰逊说，在侵犯投票权的刑事案件上，参议院可能同意联邦法官有权宣判拘禁三十日、罚款二百元。过此就必须通过陪审团。
    第二天早上，约翰逊在赴国会途中，与参议院共和党领袖诺兰通了一个无线电话。诺兰说：“听起来，你好像是在得克萨斯州。”约翰逊回答说，“如果你同意了我即将与你商谈的事，我就可以去那里度假了。”
    参议院的领袖们决定在诺兰的办公室里举行会议。约翰逊提出了他的拘禁三十日、罚款二百元的建议。诺兰提出了一个六十日、三百元的反建议。他们没有达成协议就分了手。可是双方都知道，交易快要作成了。接着，约翰逊打了一个电话给美总统。电话的要点是：再提出一个建议来，我们大概就可以取得协议了。果然，不久就有了机会，在参议院谈判的时候，诺兰把拘禁期限减低到四十五天，约翰逊把罚款限额提高到三百元。
    数分钟以后，与事情的发展保持密切联系的众议院两个老领袖终于言归于好。马丁从他的少数派领袖的座位上起立，走了三十呎长的一段路，到了议长席前。马丁与雷朋交头接耳地谈了约五分钟，他们是在谈公民权利问题吗？“啊！不。”马丁说，“我们是谈什么时候回家。”
    万事皆备，只欠投票。当天下午，马丁、雷朋、约翰逊、诺兰联合举行了一个记者招待会。宣布他们已在四十五日、三百元的基础上达成了一项妥协的妥协的妥协。
