Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 4th: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi strongly condemned "foreign treaties" and the Western countries' "Middle East vacuum" theory in a foreign policy speech to the National Assembly last night.

In his speech, Fawzi reiterated that Egypt would continue to pursue its policy of active neutrality and would not join any foreign blocs. He said: Egypt is determined to defend its independence.

Fawzi pointed out that Egypt's policy faced two major obstacles, namely, foreign treaties, especially the Baghdad Pact, and the policy of filling the power vacuum, as well as all the problems arising from this policy.

He said: "Military alliances and foreign treaties are a real threat to world peace," and these treaties must be abolished if peace is to be restored and maintained.

Fawzi said that Western countries accuse Egypt of trying to build an Egyptian empire, while they themselves are suppressing freedom in Algeria, Oman, and elsewhere. He believes that Egypt passed a severe test in the war of aggression launched against it by Britain, France, and Israel, and pointed out that after the failure of the aggression against Egypt, greedy elements are still inciting rebellion and attempting to trap Arab countries one by one through intimidation.

The Foreign Minister said that Egypt should receive compensation for the damage caused by the aggression, and Egypt will insist on full compensation.

Fawzi condemned the West's economic war against Egypt. He said: Egypt will never succumb to foreign control disguised in economic garb.

    埃外长谴责外国军事联盟
    埃及决继续坚守中立
    据新华社开罗4日电　埃及外交部长法齐昨天晚上在向国民议会发表外交政策演说时强烈谴责“外国条约”和西方国家的“中东真空”的论调。
    法齐在演说中重申埃及要继续执行它的积极中立政策，不参加任何外国集团。他说：埃及决心要保卫它的独立。
    法齐指出：埃及的政策面临着两个主要的障碍，那就是外国的条约特别是巴格达条约和填补力量真空的政策以及从这种政策中产生的一切问题。
    他说：“军事联盟和外国条约是对世界和平的真正的威胁”，如果要恢复和保持和平，这些条约必须取消。
    法齐说：西方国家指责埃及企图建立埃及帝国，而它们自己却在镇压阿尔及利亚、阿曼和其他地方的自由。他认为埃及在英法和以色列对它发动的侵略战争中通过了严重的考验，并且指出在对埃及的侵略失败后，贪婪分子仍然在煽动叛乱和企图用恫吓的办法一个个地诱陷阿拉伯国家。
    这位外交部长说：对于由于侵略而遭到的破坏，埃及应该获得赔偿，埃及将坚持充分的赔偿。
    法齐谴责西方对埃及的经济战。他说：埃及决不会对以经济外衣掩饰起来的外国控制屈服。
