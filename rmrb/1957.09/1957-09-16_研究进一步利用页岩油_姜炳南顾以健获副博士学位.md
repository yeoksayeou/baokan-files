　　Research Further Utilizes Shale Oil
　　Jiang Bingnan and Gu Yijian Obtain Associate Doctorate Degrees
　　(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 15th) Jiang Bingnan, a young scientific researcher at the Petroleum Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has found a new processing method for high-quality aviation gasoline in the study of Maoming shale oil. The gasoline processed by this method is fully suitable for use in China's jet aircraft, and the oil yield is also increased. This method can be put into production after intermediate testing.
　　On the morning of September 6, at the scientific thesis defense for the associate doctorate degree held for Comrade Jiang Bingnan at the Petroleum Research Institute, Jiang Bingnan reported on his thesis. Hou Debang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, Fu Ying, Professor of Peking University, Gu Jingxin, Dean of Fushun Petroleum Design Institute, Zhu Yajie, Professor of Beijing Petroleum College, Wu Chi, and others gave high evaluations to the thesis of this young scientist who had only graduated from university for eight and a half years, and put forward some valuable opinions and questions with great interest.
　　On September 5, another researcher, Gu Yijian, also read out the thesis "Research on Alkaline Nitrogen Compounds in Shale Oil from Fushun and Maoming, China," which was also praised by the guests at the defense. After careful analysis and research, Comrade Gu Yijian and his assistants found that shale oil in Fushun and Maoming areas contains more valuable light pyridine. Pyridine is an indispensable raw material for the production of Remifen, cardiotonics, Vitamin B, synthetic rubber, plastics, dyes and other products.
　　Jiang Bingnan and Gu Yijian completed their dissertations under the guidance of their academic supervisor, Soviet expert Kaletsky. The defense committee agreed to grant them the degree of Associate Doctor of Technical Sciences based on the results of their thesis defense.

　　研究进一步利用页岩油
　　姜炳南顾以健获副博士学位
    本报沈阳15日电  中国科学院石油研究所青年科学研究人员姜炳南，在茂名页岩油的研究中，找到了航空用优质汽油的新的加工方法。用这一方法加工出的汽油完全可以适合我国喷气式飞机使用，同时油收率也提高。这个方法经过中间试验以后即可投入生产。
    9月6日上午，在石油研究所为姜炳南同志举行的副博士学位科学论文答辩会上，姜炳南报告了他的论文。化学工业部副部长侯德榜、北京大学教授傅鹰、抚顺石油设计院院长顾敬心、北京石油学院教授朱亚杰、武迟等，都给这位大学毕业刚八年半的青年科学家的论文给予很高的评价，并以极大兴趣提出了若干宝贵的意见和问题。
    9月5日，另一位研究人员顾以健也宣读了“关于中国抚顺和茂名页岩油中碱性氮化合物的研究”论文，在答辩会上也得到来宾们的嘉许。顾以健同志和他的助手们经过细致的分析和研究，发现抚顺、茂名两地区的页岩油中含有较贵重的轻质吡啶。吡啶是生产雷米丰、强心剂、乙种维生素和人造橡胶、塑料、染料等产品不可缺少的原料。
    姜炳南和顾以健都是在他们的学术导师、苏联专家卡列契茨的指导下，完成学位论文的。答辩委员会根据他们的论文答辩结果，同意给予他们技术科学副博士学位。
