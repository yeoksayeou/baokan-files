Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 2nd. Chen Renbing, a key member of the Zhang-Luo alliance's Shanghai right-wing group, was further exposed and criticized at the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. Chen Renbing also confessed his anti-Communist and anti-socialist crimes at the meeting, and bowed his head to the people to plead guilty.

Rightist Chen Renbing confessed that he joined Luo Longji's anti-Communist and anti-socialist right-wing group in 1949. In November of the same year, when the China Democratic League held its Fourth Plenary Session to revise the league's constitution, Chu Tunan, representing Shen Junru, proposed a temporary motion to "add one secretary and one deputy secretary to the Central Political Bureau of the China Democratic League." Chen Renbing believed that this would be detrimental to Luo Longji's position in the China Democratic League, so he immediately opposed it. In this way, Chen Renbing made his first contribution to helping Luo Longji seize a leading position in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. Since then, in all activities of the China Democratic League, Chen Renbing faithfully implemented Luo Longji's reactionary line. From 1953 to this year, Luo Longji and Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong and others constantly conspired to seize leadership of national culture, education and intellectuals, and Chen Renbing also participated. Chen Renbing gradually became a major general stationed in Shanghai and East China by this group, from initially serving as a thug and staff member of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

The key members of the Zhang-Luo alliance's right-wing group in Shanghai, Chen Renbing, Peng Wenyin, Zhao Wenbi, Zhou Yongde and others, spent eight years gradually seizing almost all the leadership of the China Democratic League in Shanghai.

Chen Renbing confessed that since the Communist Party put forward the policy on intellectuals and the policy on “letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend,” and “long-term coexistence and mutual supervision,” the central political program of the Zhang-Luo alliance has been to step up arson in the cultural, educational and scientific circles, and to compete with the Communist Party for the leadership of intellectuals and cultural and educational undertakings, attempting to abolish the proletarian dictatorship through methods such as "bicameral system" and "political design institute." Chen Renbing and others actively promoted Zhang Luo's reactionary program in Shanghai, openly confronting the Communist Party. Chen Renbing also sang the bankrupt fallacy that "all democratic classes are as equal as four legs of a table," demanding the restoration of the old bourgeois political science department, and planning to organize the restoration of the bourgeois sociology symposium. The specific method used by Chen Renbing and others to attempt to usurp the leadership of the Communist Party in all aspects of work was to obliterate the achievements of the Communist Party's leadership, only talk about shortcomings, and exaggerate or even fabricate shortcomings. The shortcomings were used as "weapons" to attack the Communist Party. Chen Renbing and their small group used these "weapons" and "ammunition" to set fires in many grass-roots units.

Chen Renbing and their small group used despicable means such as opening the door to backward elements, widely absorbing elements dissatisfied with the Communist Party, treating guests and visiting, and making promises of promotion, greatly expanding the organization of the China Democratic League. In September last year, Chen Renbing also brought this malignant "great development" approach of the Zhang-Luo alliance to Zhengzhou, told the local person in charge of the China Democratic League, and advised him to listen less to the United Front Work Department of the CPC, let go and develop, and learn from Shanghai.

Professors Tan Jiazhen, Zhu Bokang, Cui Mingqi, and Hu Qiqian of Fudan University fully exposed Chen Renbing as a political careerist who was opportunistic and good at playing double-dealing tactics. The professors stated that in order to help Chen Renbing thoroughly reform, they would continue to fight him until complete victory.

### 铁的事实摆在面前不容狡辩否认  陈仁炳低头认罪交代反共罪行

    铁的事实摆在面前不容狡辩否认
    陈仁炳低头认罪交代反共罪行
    据新华社上海2日电  章罗联盟上海右派集团骨干分子陈仁炳，在上海市人民代表会议上，受到进一步的揭发和批判。陈仁炳也在会上交代了他的反共反社会主义罪行，向人民低头请罪。
    右派分子陈仁炳交代说，他在1949年投靠了罗隆基的反共反社会主义右派集团。同年11月民盟召开四中全会修改盟章时，楚图南代表沈钧儒提出“在民盟中央政治局增设正副书记各一人”的临时动议。陈仁炳认为这对罗隆基在民盟中的地位不利，就立刻反对。这样，陈仁炳就立下了帮助罗隆基在民盟中央争领导地位的第一功。此后在民盟的一切活动中，陈仁炳都忠实地执行了罗隆基的反动路线。从1953年到今年，罗隆基和曾昭抡、潘光旦、费孝通等人不断地阴谋夺取全国文化教育和知识分子的领导权，陈仁炳也参加在内。陈仁炳从最初充当章罗联盟的打手、参谋，逐渐成为这个集团驻上海和华东的一员主将。
    章罗联盟在上海的右派集团骨干陈仁炳、彭文应、赵文璧、周永德等用了八年时间，逐步夺到了几乎上海民盟的全部领导权。
    陈仁炳交代说，自从共产党提出知识分子政策和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“长期共存、互相监督”的方针以后，章罗联盟的中心政治纲领就是加紧在文化、教育、科学界放火，与共产党争夺对知识分子和文教事业的领导权，企图通过“两院制”、“政治设计院”等方法，从而取消无产阶级专政。陈仁炳等就在上海积极推销章罗的反动纲领，明目张胆地与共产党分庭抗礼。陈仁炳又唱起早已破产的“各民主阶级如同一张桌子四条腿一样平等”的谬论，要求恢复资产阶级旧政治学系，计划组织恢复资产阶级社会学座谈会。陈仁炳等企图篡夺共产党在各方面事业的领导权的具体做法是抹煞共产党领导的成绩，只谈缺点，并且夸大甚至捏造缺点。把缺点作为向共产党的进攻的“武器”。陈仁炳和他们的小集团就是用这些“武器”和“弹药”，在很多基层单位去放火。
    陈仁炳和他们的小集团以向落后开门、广泛吸收对共产党不满的分子、请客拜访、封官许愿等卑劣手段，大大扩大了民盟的组织。去年9月，陈仁炳还把章罗联盟这种恶性“大发展”的做法带到郑州，告诉当地的民盟负责人，劝他少听中共统战部的话，放开手发展，向上海看齐。
    复旦大学的谈家桢、朱伯康、崔明奇、胡其安等教授，以充分的事实揭露陈仁炳是一个投机取巧、善于玩弄两面手法的政治野心家。教授们表示为帮助陈仁炳彻底改造，一定继续与他进行斗争，直到完全胜利。
