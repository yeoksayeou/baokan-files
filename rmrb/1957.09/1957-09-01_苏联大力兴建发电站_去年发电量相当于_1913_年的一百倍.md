    Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper, August 31st. The Soviet Union is building more than 140 hydroelectric and thermal power stations. Once completed, they will add tens of millions of kilowatts of generating capacity. This is a manifestation of the Soviet Union's continued efforts to develop electricity production. Due to attention paid to national electrification, the Soviet Union has long reversed the backward situation of pre-revolutionary Russia, and has jumped to second place in the world in terms of electricity production. Last year, the Soviet Union's electricity generation was 192 billion kilowatt-hours, about 100 times that of 1913.
    A unified power system is being established in the European part of the Soviet Union, which will connect the huge power grids in the central, southern and eastern regions. High-voltage power lines of 400-500 kilovolts will be erected to transmit electricity to various places. The electricity generated by the hydropower stations on the Volga River cannot be used locally. Therefore, the electricity from the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station is transmitted to the central industrial zone through high-voltage power lines, and will also be transmitted to the Urals by the end of the year. By the year after next, the electricity from the Stalingrad Hydropower Station will be transmitted to Moscow and the Donbass. By then, the European power system will be unified.

    苏联大力兴建发电站
    去年发电量相当于1913年的一百倍
    本报莫斯科31日电  苏联正在建筑一百四十多座水力和火力发电站。它们建成后将增加几千万瓩发电能力。这是苏联再接再厉发展电力生产的表现。由于注意国家电气化，苏联早已扭转革命前俄国落后的情况，在电力生产方面跃居世界第二位。去年苏联发电量为一千九百二十亿度，约为1913年的一百倍。
    苏联欧洲部分在建立统一的电力系统，它将把中部、南部和东部的巨大电力网联接起来。将架设四、五百瓩的高压电线，以输送电力到达各处去。伏尔加河上水电站所发的电力，当地是用不了的。所以古比雪夫水电站的电力经过高压电线输送到了中部工业区，年底还要输送到乌拉尔。到后年，斯大林格勒水电站的电力将输送到莫斯科和顿巴斯。到那时，欧洲电力系统将统一起来了。
