Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Tokyo dispatch: The Maebashi District Court of Japan held the second public trial today for the case of American soldier Girard shooting and killing Japanese farmer Sakae Nakako (formerly translated as Sakae Naka). In the face of substantial witness testimony and physical evidence, the murderer Girard was unable to further deny his crimes.

Japanese farmer Ono Seki Hideshi went to the Soumagahara drill grounds with the victim on January 30 of this year to pick up shell casings. He testified that he personally saw Girard fire a bullet at Sakae Nakako, killing her. American soldier Nackel, who was on duty with Girard, testified that his partner Girard apparently attempted to lure Sakae Nakako and other Japanese people picking up shell casings to their deaths. He said that Girard threw out some shell casings at the time, and used the Japanese phrase "it's okay" to lure the Japanese to pick them up. After they were deceived, Girard fired shell casings at them with a rifle grenade launcher.

The Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office then presented thirty-two pieces of evidence documents. The prosecutor's office proved through these documents that the murderer Girard had repeatedly shot at other Japanese people picking up shell casings before killing Sakae. Other American soldiers were also amusing themselves by shooting at Japanese people picking up shell casings. The prosecutor's office said that shooting Japanese people had become a "sport" for American soldiers.

Public trials will continue to be held on the 12th, 13th, and 14th of September.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to an announcement made this morning by the United States Army authorities stationed in Japan, Lieutenant Colonel Heffley, the chief representative of the United States Army Compensation Bureau, and Konishi, a representative from the Japan Procurement Agency, visited the home of Sakae Akikichi, the husband of Sakae Nakako, and offered him 629,396 yen in "condolence money." Sakae Akikichi refused the American request on the spot, saying, "At this time, I don't want to talk about money." (Attached picture)

    日本法庭二审哲腊德
    杀人犯在人证物证面前无法狡辩
    坂井奈加子之夫不要美国买命钱
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本前桥地方裁判所今天举行了对美国兵哲腊德枪杀日本农妇坂井奈加子（前译音为坂井中）案件的第二次公审。在大量的人证物证面前，杀人犯哲腊德无法再为自己的罪行进行狡辩。
    日本农民小野关秀次今年1月30日曾经同被害者一起到相马原演习场去拾弹壳。他证明他亲眼看到哲腊德向坂井奈加子发射子弹，打死了她。和哲腊德一起值勤的美国兵奈克尔作证说，他的伙伴哲腊德当时显然企图诱杀坂井奈加子和其他捡弹壳的日本人。他说，哲腊德当时扔出一些弹壳，并且用日本话说“没有关系”去引诱日本人去拾捡。等他们受骗后，哲腊德用枪榴筒发出弹壳射击了他们。
    前桥地方检察厅接着又提出证据文件三十二件。检察厅通过这些文件证明：凶手哲腊德在打死坂井以前还曾经三番两次地射击过其他捡弹壳的日本人。其他美国兵当时也以射击捡弹壳的日本人作乐。检察厅说：射击日本人已经成了美国兵的一种“运动”。
    9月12、13、14三日将继续举行公审。
    据新华社6日讯　据美国驻日陆军当局今天早晨宣布，美国陆军赔偿局首席代表赫菲利中校同日本调达厅代表小西到坂井奈加子的丈夫坂井秋吉的家里访问，表示要付给他六十二万九千三百九十六日元“慰问费”。坂井秋吉当场拒绝了美方的要求，他说：“在这个时候，我不想谈关于钱的问题”。（附图片）
