    Arctic Seabed Mountain Ranges Undulate, Pacific Ocean Plunges to Ten Thousand Meters
    The Soviet research vessel "Vityaz" recently used radio detectors in the Pacific Ocean near the Mariana Islands to detect a depth of 10,960 meters in that area. This is the deepest point in the Pacific Ocean, and thus in the world's oceans, 97 meters deeper than the deepest point measured in that area six years ago by the British ship "Challenger."
    The "Vityaz" has been conducting research work in the Western Pacific for two months. It carries the latest equipment. During the investigation, the ship's scientific personnel also used a new type of camera to take the first photos of the seabed at a depth of 5,780 meters.

    北极海底山峦起伏  太平洋下水深万米
    苏联考察船“勇士号”，最近在太平洋马里亚纳群岛附近的洋面上用无线电探测器探测出那个地区的水深达一万零九百六十公尺。这是太平洋、也就是全世界海洋的最深处，它比六年前英国船“挑战者号”在那个地区测量得到的最深处又深了九十七公尺。
    “勇士号”已经在西太平洋进行了两个月的考察工作。它携带的仪器都是最新式的。在考察过程中，船上的科学人员还用新型的摄影机第一次摄取了五千七百八十公尺深处的海底照片。
