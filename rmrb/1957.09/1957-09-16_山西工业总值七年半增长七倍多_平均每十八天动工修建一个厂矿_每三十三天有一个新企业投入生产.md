　　Taiyuan, September 15th (By our newspaper). Since liberation, socialist industrial construction in Shanxi Province has achieved rapid development.
　　Shanxi Province's modern industry began construction in 1892. By 1949, the province had a total of 101 large, medium, and small industrial enterprises. From January 1950 to the end of June 1957, a total of 487 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mining enterprises were newly built, expanded, and restored throughout the province, including 152 newly built ones. On average, a factory or mine started construction every eighteen days. Among the newly built enterprises are the Taiyuan No. 1 and No. 2 Thermal Power Plants, which use the latest technology and equipment; the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, which is large-scale and fully equipped; the Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, which produces heavy industrial technical equipment; the Taiyuan Chemical Plant, which produces tens of thousands of tons of sulfuric acid annually; the Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant, Shanxi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, and agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plants and joint processing plants throughout the province, which serve agricultural technical transformation, and so on. As of now, eighty-two of these newly built enterprise units have been completed and put into production, with a new factory going into production every thirty-three days on average. After expansion, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant now possesses a complete set of smelting and forging equipment from coking and ironmaking to steelmaking and steel rolling, and has workshops for producing thin plates, forged steel, and refractory materials, becoming the largest iron and steel complex in the country.
　　According to statistics from the early days of liberation to the end of 1956, the total industrial output value of the province increased by 7.76 times, with an average annual increase of 36.3%. Among them, the output of major products, such as: electricity increased by 9.73 times, raw coal increased by 5.6 times, pig iron increased by 9.52 times, steel increased by 19.73 times, cement increased by 15 times, cotton cloth increased by 4.06 times, and flour increased by 12.34 times. If the development speed of these seven and a half years is calculated based on the average annual growth rate of the forty-four years before the Anti-Japanese War (from the establishment of the match factory in 1892 to 1936), it would take 339 years to achieve this.
　　Many products that could not be manufactured in the past can now be manufactured. For example, in the early days of liberation, the machinery manufacturing industry could only repair and manufacture some simple and small machines. Currently, it is able to produce important new products such as coal mining machines, drilling machines, drilling machines, bulldozers, rock loading machines, large gas generators, electric arc steelmaking furnaces, bridge cranes, and spinning machines. The steel industry, which could not produce alloy tool steel, alloy structural steel, silicon steel, thin plates and other steel products in the past, can now produce them in large quantities.

### 山西工业总值七年半增长七倍多　平均每十八天动工修建一个厂矿　每三十三天有一个新企业投入生产

　　山西工业总值七年半增长七倍多
　　平均每十八天动工修建一个厂矿
　　每三十三天有一个新企业投入生产
    本报太原15日电  山西省解放以来，社会主义工业建设获得了突飞猛进的发展。
    山西省的现代工业是从1892年开始建设的，到1949年，全省共有大、中、小型工业企业一百零一个。从1950年1月到1957年6月底，全省共新建、扩建和恢复的国营、地方国营厂矿企业单位共四百八十七个，其中新建的一百五十二个，平均每十八天就有一座工厂或矿井动工兴建。在新建企业中，有采用最新技术装备的太原第一、第二热电厂；有规模宏大、设备完全的经纬纺织机械制造厂；有生产重工业技术装备的重型机器制造厂；有年产硫酸几万吨的太原化工厂；有为农业技术改造服务的太原肥料厂、山西磷肥厂和遍布全省的农业机械修造厂、联合加工厂等等。这些新建企业单位，截至目前止，竣工投入生产的已有八十二个，平均每三十三天就有一个新厂投入生产。太原钢铁厂经过扩建以后，目前已拥有从炼焦、炼铁到炼钢、轧钢等整套冶炼和锻压设备，有生产薄板、锻钢、耐火材料等车间，成为现在关内最大的钢铁联合企业。
    从解放初期到1956年底的统计，全省工业总产值增长了七点七六倍，每年平均递增36.3％。其中主要产品的产量，如：电力增加了九点七三倍，原煤增加了五点六倍，生铁增加了九点五二倍，钢增加了十九点七三倍，水泥增加了十五倍，棉布增加了四点零六倍，面粉增加了十二点三四倍。这七年半的发展速度，如果以抗战以前四十四年（1892年创办火柴局开始到1936年）每年平均增长的速度计算，则需要三百三十九年时间才能达到。
    许多过去不能制造的产品现在都能制造了。如机器制造业在解放初期只能修配和制造一些简单的小型机器，目前已经能够生产挖煤机、钻探机、打眼机、推土机、装岩机、大型煤气发生炉、电弧炼钢炉、桥式起重机、纺纱机等重要新产品。钢铁工业，过去不能生产的合金工具钢、合金结构钢、矽钢、薄板等钢材，现在都能大量生产了。
