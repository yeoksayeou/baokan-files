Xinhua News Agency, September 24th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session on the afternoon of the 23rd discussed whether to include the "issue of Chinese representation" proposed by India on the agenda of the General Assembly.

    Indian representative Menon, in his speech, requested the General Assembly to include this item on the agenda. He asked the General Assembly to amend the General Committee's resolution opposing the discussion of this issue, so that the General Assembly would agree to, instead of reject, India's proposal. He said that the General Committee has no power to say whether a certain item should or should not be discussed. The Indian representative also requested the deletion of the second part of the General Committee's resolution: that the current General Assembly would not discuss any proposals to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to obtain seats or to deprive the Kuomintang elements of their seats.
    Menon said that it would be a great mistake to avoid discussing such an important issue—an issue involving the representation of a country with 600 million people, a founding member of the United Nations. He pointed out that discussing this issue now is as important as discussing disarmament and other pressing issues for the United Nations.
    Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko said that any further delay by the United Nations in considering the admission of the People's Republic of China would only undermine and weaken the United Nations organization. He said that there is no reason to exclude the People's Republic of China from the United Nations simply because the U.S. government does not like the way of life in People's China.
    Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki said that the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the issue of restoring the seat of the People's Republic of China could greatly promote the relaxation of the international situation.
    Ceylon representative Gunawardene supported India's request, saying: It is inconceivable that the 600 million people on mainland China are excluded from the United Nations.
    Irish Foreign Minister Aiken said that his country does not sympathize with China's ideology, but he will support India's request.
    U.S. representative Lodge tried his best to oppose including the issue of Chinese representation on the agenda. He also put forward a motion suggesting that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly should not discuss this issue.
    British representative Dixon once again supported the U.S. attitude. He said that discussing the issue of Chinese representation at this time would only exacerbate tensions. Dixon also attempted to alleviate Britain's accomplice responsibility by saying that the issue of admitting China would be considered someday in the future. Representatives from Australia and the Kuomintang elements supported the U.S. attitude.
    Due to the opposition from India and the Soviet Union and other countries, the General Assembly did not vote on the U.S. motion that day. The debate on this issue will continue on the afternoon of the 24th.
    The General Assembly on the same day passed a resolution to include the "Hungarian question" on the agenda of the General Assembly with fifty-seven votes in favor, ten votes against, and six abstentions. The Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies voted against it. During the discussion, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko pointed out that the "Hungarian question" was fabricated by the U.S. State Department. The initiators of this dirty affair are trying to poison the atmosphere and keep the United Nations General Assembly in a state of constant tension, and to divert people's attention from disarmament and the Middle East issue.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 24th: According to the United Press of India, Nepalese Prime Minister Singh said in a conversation with foreign reporters that Nepal will support the restoration of China's status in the United Nations.
    Singh said that people must adopt a realistic attitude and face the facts. Nepal and China have a common border of hundreds of miles, so we cannot ignore China. "We cannot just decide: they do not exist."

    印苏等国代表反对总务委员会决议
    要联大讨论中国代表权问题
    葛罗米柯指责美国借“匈牙利问题”毒化国际气氛
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议23日下午讨论是否把印度提出的“中国代表权问题”列入大会议程。
    印度代表梅农在发言中要求大会把这个项目列入议程。他要求大会对总务委员会的反对讨论这个问题的决议作出修正，让大会同意而不是拒绝印度的建议。他说，总务委员会没有权力说某个项目应该或不应该讨论。印度代表还要求删去总务委员会决议的第二部分：本届大会不讨论让中华人民共和国代表取得席位或者是剥夺国民党分子的席位的任何建议。
    梅农说，如果避免讨论这样重要的问题——一个牵涉到有六亿人民的国家、一个联合国创始国的代表权的问题——那是非常错误的。他指出，现在讨论这个问题和讨论裁军问题以及其他联合国迫不及待的问题同样重要。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯说，联合国在考虑接纳中华人民共和国的问题上再进行任何拖延只会破坏和削弱联合国组织。他说，没有理由因为美国政府不喜欢人民中国的生活方式就把中华人民共和国排除在联合国之外。
    波兰外交部长拉帕茨基说，联合国大会讨论恢复中华人民共和国的席位问题能够大大促进国际局势的缓和。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼支持印度的要求，他说：中国大陆上的六亿人民竟然被排除在联合国以外，这是不可思议的。
    爱尔兰外交部长埃肯说，他的国家并不同情中国的意识形态，但是他将支持印度的要求。
    美国代表洛奇竭力反对把中国代表权问题列入议程。他还提出一个动议，建议联合国本届大会不讨论这个问题。
    英国代表狄克逊再一次支持美国的态度。他说什么在这个时候讨论中国代表权问题将只能加剧紧张局势。狄克逊还企图用所谓将来终有一天会考虑接纳中国的问题的说法来减轻英国的帮凶责任。澳大利亚和国民党分子的代表支持美国的态度。
    由于印度和苏联等国的反对，大会这一天没有对美国的动议进行表决。关于这个问题的辩论将在24日下午继续进行。
    大会同一天以五十七票赞成、十票反对和六票弃权通过了把“匈牙利问题”列入大会议程。投反对票的是苏联和东欧人民民主国家。在讨论时，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯指出，“匈牙利问题”是美国国务院制造出来的。这件肮脏事情的发动者企图毒化气氛和使联合国大会处于始终紧张的状态中，并且来转移人们对裁军和中东问题的注意。
    新华社新德里24日电　据印度统一通讯社报道，尼泊尔首相辛格在和外国记者谈话时说，尼泊尔将支持恢复中国在联合国的地位。
    辛格说，人们必须采取现实态度并面对事实。尼泊尔和中国有共同的边界几百英里，因此我们就不能无视中国。“我们就不能这样决定：他们是不存在的。”
