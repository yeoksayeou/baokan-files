    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 11th: Avirmed, a member of the Mongolian government delegation currently visiting here and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference on the 10th that the United Nations Security Council, under the obstruction of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the United States, had rejected Mongolia's participation in the United Nations. The People's Republic of Mongolia firmly protests this unjust decision by the United Nations. This behavior is contrary to the wishes of the majority of member states and world opinion. He said that Mongolia is a country with a long history and cultural tradition, and a republic was established after the victory of the revolution in 1921. In the short historical period since its founding, Mongolia has made tremendous achievements in culture and economy. Mongolia is playing an increasingly active role in the struggle for world peace and friendship. Its economic and cultural cooperation with many countries is strengthening day by day.
    Avirmed emphasized that rejecting Mongolia's membership in the United Nations disregards Mongolia's legitimate rights and seriously damages the prestige of the United Nations. Mongolia firmly demands the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek elements from the United Nations and the Security Council, and the restoration of China's legitimate rights.

　　蒙外长抗议安理会无理决定
　　认为它无视蒙古合法权利并损害联合国威信
    新华社布达佩斯11日电　正在这里访问的蒙古政府代表团团员、外交部长阿维尔齐德10日在记者招待会上发表声明说，联合国安全理事会在蒋介石集团和美国等的阻挠下否决了蒙古参加联合国，蒙古人民共和国坚决抗议联合国这种不公正的决定。这种行为是违反大多数会员国的意愿和世界舆论的。他说，蒙古是一个有悠久历史和文化传统的国家，从1921年革命胜利后，就成立了共和国。在立国以来的短短的历史时期内，蒙古在文化、经济上又获得了巨大的成就。蒙古在争取世界和平和友谊的斗争中日益起着积极作用。它同许多国家的经济、文化的合作关系一天天加强。
    阿维尔齐德强调说，否决蒙古加入联合国问题是无视蒙古的合法权利，给联合国的威信带来了严重的损害。蒙古坚决要求从联合国和安理会中驱逐蒋介石分子，并恢复中国的合法权利。
