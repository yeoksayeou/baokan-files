    Kaiyuan Ancient Coin
    Workers at the Yucheng Xing Brick and Tile Factory in Yongchun County, Fujian Province, unearthed three "Kaiyuan Tongbao" ancient coins at the Moxia Village tomb mound in Xiaohu Township, with the character "Fu" on the back. These three ancient coins are lead coins cast by Wang Shenzhi, the King of Min during the Five Dynasties period, as recorded in both the "Ten Kingdoms Chronicle of Min History" and the "Grand Dictionary of Ancient Coins."
