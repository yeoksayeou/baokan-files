Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 31st. The thousands of bridge construction workers who grew up during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are, as the bridge project nears completion, setting off one after another to various rivers, large and small, across the country to take on new bridge construction tasks.

The reporter learned from the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau that, to date, this large-scale bridge construction enterprise, which has developed from scratch in just over three years, has undertaken and is in the process of accepting bridge projects numbering more than ten, in addition to the bridges of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge system. These projects include the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge, the Tongguan Yellow River Bridge, the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge, and the Jialing River Highway Bridge; the Zhang River, Anyang River, Huai River, and Hutuo River bridges on the Beijing-Hankou Railway double-track line; as well as the Yibin Minjiang River Bridge and the Hengyang Xiangjiang River Bridge. The Engineering Bureau is also preparing to accept several new and reconstructed bridge projects on the Jinsha River, Gan River, and Songhua River.

In the approximately three and a half years since the construction of the Han River Railway Bridge, an important component of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, this bridge engineering bureau has developed into a bridge construction base with over eight thousand employees and a complete set of bridge building equipment. It can not only undertake various bridge construction tasks but can also independently design various types of bridges.

    十座大桥陆续修建
    建设长江大桥的健儿大显身手
    据新华社武汉31日电  在武汉长江大桥建设中成长起来的数以千计的桥梁建设者，随着这个桥梁工程的即将完工，正在陆续奔赴祖国许多大小江河，担任新的桥梁建设任务。
    记者从武汉长江大桥工程局获悉：到目前为止，这个在三年多时间内从无到有发展起来的大型桥梁建筑企业，已经承担和正在接受的桥梁工程，除武汉长江大桥系统的各桥外，还有十多座。这些工程中包括有：郑州黄河大桥，潼关黄河大桥，重庆长江大桥和嘉陵江公路桥；京汉铁路复线上的漳河、安阳河、槐河、滹沱河等桥；以及宜宾岷江大桥和衡阳湘江大桥等。工程局还准备接受金沙江、赣江和松花江上的几座新建桥和改建桥工程。
    从武汉长江大桥的重要组成部分——汉水铁路桥开始建设以来的约三年半的时间内，这个大桥工程局已发展成拥有八千多职工和一套完整的建桥设备的桥梁建筑基地；它不仅能承担各类桥梁施工任务，还能独立进行各类桥梁的设计。
