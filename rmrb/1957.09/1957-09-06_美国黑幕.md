American Underworld
    Chicago is a Bastion of Racial Discrimination
    A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report" stated that Chicago, the second largest city in the United States located in the North, has become "the most racially segregated place in the world."

    The magazine stated that an estimated 2,000 Black people move to Chicago each month, and that racists in Chicago incite white residents not to allow Black people to move into "white areas," "as a result, they all live in slums."

    The magazine also stated: "No matter his ability, it is very difficult for a new Black person to get the job he wants. Chicago has built a barrier to exclude Black people. They are rarely seen doing other jobs besides service industries. The jobs they can find are hotel maids, taxi drivers, porters, and street cleaners. Black women are rarely hired as sales clerks or waitresses. Most hotels use white waiters.

    "A recent survey by the Jewish Labor Committee found that 98% of Chicago employment agencies stated that they do not want Black people, and 20% do not want Jewish and Catholic people."

    The magazine described the racial discrimination situation in this city, saying, "Groups of (white) young people throw stones at cars carrying Black people. Some Black people are beaten by white people while fishing or on their way home from work.

    Criminal Comic Books
    This kind of comic book is a poisonous substance that specializes in educating children about cruelty, violence, and crime. The entire book is about introducing criminals' methods of theft and murder, as well as some scandalous and immoral things, and it often introduces children to the latest tools for breaking into safes. This kind of comic book, like a demon, is entangling American children, and its sales volume reaches more than one billion copies every year. Recently, Newsweek magazine published a story about a fourteen-year-old boy named Andre who killed his mother and sister after reading a large number of these comic books.

    美国黑幕
    芝加哥是种族歧视的堡垒
    不久前的一期“美国新闻与世界报道”说，位在北部的美国第二大城芝加哥已经成了“世界上种族隔离最突出的地方”。
    这家杂志说，据估计每月约有二千名黑人迁来芝加哥，芝加哥的种族主义分子煽动一般白人居民不许黑人移入 “白人地区”，“结果他们都在贫民窟中栖身”。
    这家杂志还说：“不论他的能力如何，一个新来的黑人要想得到他所想要的工作是很难的。芝加哥树立了排斥黑人的壁垒。除了服务性的行业以外很少看见他们从事其他工作。他们能找到的工作是旅馆的女佣、出租汽车的司机、脚夫和清道夫。黑种妇女很少能够被雇用为售货员或女侍。大多数旅馆都用白人侍者。
    “犹太人工作问题研究局最近的调查发现芝加哥征求职员的机构有98％都声明不要黑人，有20％不要犹太和天主教徒。”
    这家杂志描写这个城市种族歧视的情景说，“一群一群的（白人）青年人向坐着黑人的汽车扔石头。有的黑人在钓鱼的时候或下班回家的途中被白人拳足交加地打了一顿。
    行凶连环画
    这种连环画是专门教育孩子残酷，暴虐，犯罪的毒物。通本尽是介绍匪徒的偷盗法，杀人法，以及一些伤风败俗的丑事，还经常给孩子们介绍打破保险柜的最新工具。这种连环画像魔鬼一样的缠着了美国儿童，它的行销量每年高达十亿多份。最近美国新闻周刊登载的一个十四岁名叫安德烈的男孩读了大批的这类连环画后就亲手杀死了自己的母亲和姐姐。
