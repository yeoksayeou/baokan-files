Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Baltimore dispatch: "Baltimore Sun" reporter McCardell recently published an article after visiting Algeria, saying that he firmly believes: "The Algerian National Liberation Front, which guides the Algerian revolution, is a powerful group; it is well-organized and enjoys widespread support from Algerian Arabs." He also said, "Algerian Arabs are suffering inhuman terror at the hands of French soldiers."
    McCardell spent two weeks visiting the rear areas of the Algerian National Liberation Army, observing their operations, marching with them, and also visiting their refugee camps and questioning many of them.
    McCardell said, "I saw how the Algerian army fought and how they tried to deal with the Algerian refugee problem without any French help; judging from these circumstances, I think the Algerian National Liberation Front is a fairly well-organized group and enjoys the widespread support of the Algerian Arabs.
    "The National Liberation Army is not to be taken lightly. According to unofficial estimates, it has a total of 160,000 to 200,000 people. When I saw it, the army had no artillery, anti-aircraft guns, or motor transport. But this is an army that can march eighteen hours day and night. This is an army that can go without food for four days. It does not need excessive transportation. This is an army that can survive by relying on its own country. As far as I know, the local people fully support it."
    McCardell wrote: "The status of the Arabs in Algeria is in many ways similar to that of disenfranchised blacks in some parts of the deep South of America. Although Arabs outnumber Europeans by at least nine to one and are growing much faster, they do not enjoy the same civil and voting rights... Many mixed-race Algerians are extremely disappointed and resentful because of the racial discrimination of the French regime."

### 美记者报道访问阿尔及利亚观感  阿民族解放阵线深得人心

　　美记者报道访问阿尔及利亚观感
　　阿民族解放阵线深得人心
    新华社14日讯  巴尔的摩消息：“巴尔的摩太阳报”记者麦卡德耳最近在访问阿尔及利亚归来后发表文章说，他深信：“指导阿尔及利亚革命的阿尔及利亚民族阵线是一个有力量的团体；它的组织良好，并且受到阿尔及利亚阿拉伯人的普遍拥护。”他还说，“阿尔及利亚的阿拉伯人遭受着法国士兵的非人的恐怖对待。”
    麦卡德耳曾经在阿尔及利亚民族解放军的后方进行了两个星期的访问，观察了他们的作战，同他们一起行路，并且还访问了他们的难民营和对他们当中许多人提出了问题。
    麦卡德耳说，“我看见阿尔及利亚军队如何作战，并且看到他们如何在没有任何法国帮助之下努力处理阿尔及利亚难民问题；根据这些情况来判断，我认为阿尔及利亚民族阵线是一个组织得相当好的团体，并且享有阿尔及利亚阿拉伯人的普遍拥护。
    “民族解放军是不可轻视的。据非官方估计，它一共有十六万至二十万人。在我看到它的时候，这支军队是没有大炮、高射炮或摩托运输工具的。但是这是一支一天一夜可以行军十八小时的军队。这是一支可以坚持四天不吃东西的军队。它不需要过多的运输工具。这是一支可以依靠本国而生存的军队。就我所知，当地人民是完全支持它的。”
    麦卡德耳写道：“阿尔及利亚的阿拉伯人的地位，在很多方面同美洲极南部一些地方的被剥夺公民权的黑人相似。虽然阿拉伯人在人数上至少超过欧洲人九倍，并且人口增加速度要快得多，但是他们并不享有同样的公民权和选举权……许多混血的阿尔及利亚人由于受到法国政权的种族歧视而感到极为失望和愤慨。”
