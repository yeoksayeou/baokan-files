　　The Xiashi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Summer Harvest and Summer Planting
　　The Xiashi Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture of Guangxi Province was established in 1955. The cooperative has more than 200 households and is located in the picturesque semi-mountainous area of Guixi. The cooperative's agricultural and sideline production are well-developed. It had a bumper harvest last year, and 95.6% of the members increased their income. 40% of the members had surplus grain to sell to the state. The director of the cooperative said, "In the past, about 80% of the Zhuang people in our area did not have enough to eat. Many farmers often lived on tree leaves, grass seeds, and grass roots, and many were forced to go out begging. Now it's different. We have established a cooperative, and the members have enough to eat and wear, and they also have surplus grain to sell to the state..." He paused and then said, "The rightists say that our farmers' lives have declined. This is pure nonsense and a distortion of the facts."

　　僮族人民生活欣欣向荣
　　夏收夏种中的夏石农业生产合作社
    广西省桂西僮族自治州夏石高级农业生产合作社，是在1955年成立的。全社共有二百多户，位于桂西山明水秀的半山区。合作社的农业和副业生产都很发达，去年获得大丰收，95.6％的社员都增加了收入。40％的社员都有余粮卖给国家。社主任说：“我们这里的僮族人民过去有80％左右的农户是不够吃的，许多农民常以树叶、草籽、草根糊口，有许多人被迫出外讨饭。现在不同了，我们成立了合作社，社员们有了吃有了穿，还有余粮卖给国家……。”他顿了一下又说：“右派分子说我们农民生活下降了，这真是胡说八道，颠倒黑白。”
