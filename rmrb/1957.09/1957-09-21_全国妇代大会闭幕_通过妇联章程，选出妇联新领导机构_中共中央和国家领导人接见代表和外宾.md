Xinhua News Agency, September 20th. The Third National Women's Congress of China victoriously concluded today after eleven days of meetings.

	Deng Yingchao said in her closing speech at the closing ceremony this afternoon: The gains of this conference are enormous. The conference discussed the fundamental policy guiding women's work during the period of socialist construction, which is the policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift.

	Deng Yingchao said that this conference truly became a grand classroom for repelling right-wing elements and distinguishing between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Through the exposure and criticism of right-wing elements, we have more clearly demarcated the boundaries between socialism and capitalism and have more firmly determined to follow the Communist Party on the socialist road. Deng Yingchao said that all of this has played a positive role in promoting the vast number of women to successfully pass the socialist test.

	She said that our conference has truly become a conference to mobilize women across the country to further implement the policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift. Everyone should publicize and implement the spirit and resolutions of the conference among women of all ethnic groups and social strata, build the country and manage households with diligence and thrift, and strive to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist nation.

	The conference today elected the new leadership of the All-China Women's Federation. Two hundred and two people were elected as members of the Third Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation, and another forty-three people were elected as alternate members. The previous Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation had one hundred and twenty-six members, and the new leadership has broader representation than in the past.

	During the conference, one hundred and thirty-seven delegates spoke, and two hundred and thirty-nine delegates made written statements. Today, the conference passed a resolution on the report made by Zhang Yun on behalf of the Second Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation to the conference, "Build the Country and Manage Households with Diligence and Thrift, and Strive to Build Socialism." This resolution calls on women of all ethnic groups and social strata across the country to make unremitting efforts to implement the glorious and arduous tasks put forward in this report.

	Next, the conference adopted the "Constitution of the All-China Women's Federation."

	After Deng Yingchao delivered the closing speech, Young Pioneers presented flowers to the conference and delivered congratulatory messages. After the band played the national anthem, the conference victoriously concluded.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 20th. CCP Central Committee leaders Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, and Deng Xiaoping received all the delegates attending the Third National Women's Congress of China at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai this noon.
