Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 26th: Saudi Arabian King Saud arrived in Damascus on the afternoon of September 25th at the invitation of Syrian President Kuwatly for a three-day visit.

Political circles here attach great importance to this visit, as it is taking place after the deterioration of Syrian-Saudi relations, although relations between the two countries have recently eased. The deterioration of Syrian-Saudi relations was caused by the divisive policies adopted by the United States after the coup in Jordan.

During his visit, Saud will hold talks with Kuwatly and other Syrian officials. It is reported that the talks will discuss the relations between Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.

Some newspapers here said on September 25th that the talks may lead to the resumption of top-level talks between President Nasser, President Kuwatly, and King Saud.

Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: Iraqi Prime Minister Jawdat Ayubi arrived in Damascus, the Syrian capital, today for a visit. This is the first visit to Syria by a high-ranking government official since Iraq joined the Baghdad Pact. His visit has attracted attention. After arriving in Damascus, Jawdat immediately went to the Syrian Parliament to attend a luncheon held in honor of Saudi Arabian King Saud.

    据新华社大马士革26日电　沙特阿拉伯国王沙特应叙利亚总统库阿特利的邀请在9月25日下午到达大马士革，作为时三天的访问。
    这里的政界人士极为重视这次访问，因为这次访问是在叙沙关系恶化之后进行的，虽然两国关系最近已经缓和。叙沙关系恶化是由于在约旦政变以后美国采取的挑拨离间政策所造成的。
    沙特在这次访问期间，将同库阿特利和其他叙利亚官员进行会谈。据悉，会谈将讨论叙、沙、埃三国关系问题。
    这里有的报纸9月25日说，这次会谈可能使纳赛尔总统、库阿特利总统和沙特国王之间恢复举行最高级会谈。
