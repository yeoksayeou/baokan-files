Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. The extraordinary flood peak of the Songhua River's main stream is passing through the Harbin area and moving towards the middle and lower reaches of the Songhua River. The water levels of the middle and lower reaches of the Songhua River have been rising sharply for consecutive days. As of 8:00 AM today, the water levels in the Mulan and Tonghe areas have exceeded the historical high water level record of 1956 by eighteen centimeters. The water level in the Jiamusi area is only four centimeters away from the historical high water level. The water level in the Fujin area, where the Songhua River and Heilongjiang River converge, has been rising by more than ten centimeters every day.

To protect the agricultural harvest and the safety of the lives and property of urban and rural people, more than 150,000 people in more than ten cities and counties along the middle and lower reaches of the Songhua River participated in flood control yesterday. These flood control personnel are working day and night to raise and thicken the dikes. On the 5th and 6th, the Jiamusi area was hit by wind and rain under high water levels. Thanks to the emergency repairs and damming by 20,000 people, the seventy-mile-long dike still stands unscathed. To prevent wind and waves from scouring, they have been building stone revetments and rushing to repair dikes for days. A large number of materials such as grass bags and wooden poles are constantly being transported to the dikes for emergency repairs and dike construction.

The Provincial Flood Control Headquarters has established a Flood Control Sub-Headquarters for the middle and lower reaches of the Songhua River in Jiamusi City. Led by Deputy Governor Yu Jie, including more than thirty department and bureau-level cadres, is directing the flood control struggle in various counties along the river.

    松花江中下游水位连日猛涨
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　松花江干流的特大洪峰正通过哈尔滨地区移向松花江中、下游。中、下游松花江水位连日猛涨，今日早晨八时止，木兰、通河地区水位均超过1956年历史最高的水位纪录十八公分。佳木斯地区水位距历史最高水位只差四公分。松花江和黑龙江汇流的富锦地区水位每天都上涨十余公分。
    为保卫农业丰收和城乡人民生命财产安全，沿松花江中、下游的十多个市、县，昨天参加防汛的人数已达十五万人。这些防汛人员日夜不停地将堤坝加高培厚。5、6两日，佳木斯地区在高水位的情况下，遭受了风雨的袭击，由于两万人的抢修堵险，七十里长堤仍然屹立无恙，为防止风浪冲刷，他们连日砌石护坡，抢险、修堤用的大批草袋、木杆等物资，正不断地运到堤上。
    省防汛指挥部已在佳木斯市成立了松花江中、下游防汛分指挥部。由副省长于杰领导的包括三十多个厅、局长级干部，正在沿江各县指挥防洪斗争。
