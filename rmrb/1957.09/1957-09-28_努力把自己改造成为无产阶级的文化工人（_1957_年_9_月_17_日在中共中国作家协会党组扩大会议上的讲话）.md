The anti-Rightist struggle in literary and art circles is an important front in the entire anti-Rightist struggle. The victory of the struggle in literary and art circles can not only purify the literary and art ranks and consolidate the Party's leadership over literature and art, but also encourage the battles of all sectors of the country, so that socialist education can be more popular and more in-depth. We must persist in continuing the struggle, strive for a complete victory, and enable every comrade in our literary and art circles to become an intellectual of the working class and pass the great test of socialist revolution.

I have long read the People's Daily editorial on September 1, "Struggle to Defend the Socialist Literary and Art Line," and I fully support it. I have also constantly seen reports on the People's Daily about breaking through the Ding Chen anti-Party group and exposing other Rightists in literary and art circles. To be honest, I am shocked every time I see it. Some of the thoughts, words, and deeds of those Rightist gentlemen were completely unexpected to me.

I am not familiar with Chen Qixia and Li Youran, but I am more familiar with Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and Ai Qing. Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng are veteran Party members with 20 or 30 years of Party membership, and Xuefeng even participated in the 25,000-li Long March. I always thought that their ideological standpoints were probably not a problem. Even if there were objectionable aspects to their private lives and personal histories, they should still be comrades with achievements and worthy of respect, with only minor flaws. Who knew that their thoughts, words, and deeds would be so unspeakable, but they have finally come to light.

Strictly speaking, I have probably only read one of Ding Ling's works, "When I Was in Xia Village." That was in August 1946, before the liberation, when I first read works from the liberated areas in Shanghai. At that time, Comrade Lu Dingyi gave me two books, one was Comrade Zhao Shuli's "The Ballads of Li Youcai," and the other was "Selected Short Stories from the Liberated Areas, First Series." I eagerly spent several hours reading them all in one breath. I wrote a postscript called "Ballads and Others" (see "Tian Di Xuan Huang," page 420). I said, "I was completely intoxicated by the novel, healthy, and simple content and techniques. Here is a new world, new characters, new emotions, new styles, and new culture. I believe that anyone who reads it will feel interested." This expressed my longing for works from the liberated areas and for the liberated areas at that time. This was not just my personal feeling, but the common feeling of people who supported the Party and the revolution. In the KMT-controlled areas, we regarded Yan'an as a revolutionary holy land, and works from Yan'an were, of course, revolutionary spiritual food. However, I did not express enough praise for Ding Ling's "When I Was in Xia Village." My postscript had this section:

"The selection of works contains a total of twelve short stories, all written about real people and events, but more legendary than any legendary work. The first is Ding Ling's "When I Was in Xia Village." Ding Ling is a well-known writer in China and abroad, but compared with the other eleven stories, her work is rather inferior in terms of technique. This is exactly a standard measure, from which we can know how high a level the other eleven writers have reached."

These words were quite polite, but in fact, it was not just a matter of "technique." "When I Was in Xia Village" is about sympathizing with a woman who lost her chastity to the enemy but still holds on to her vanity, while at the same time exposing the people of the liberated areas as if they lacked sympathy. I felt that this work was not educational. Why should Ding Ling sympathize with such a person and write about her with a contemptuous attitude towards the people? My dissatisfaction lay here, but I was in the KMT-controlled area at that time and could not write it out frankly. Today, I can understand Ding Ling. The reason why she sympathized with Zhenzhen was, in fact, to sympathize with Ding Ling. The portraits of characters by painters or sculptors often resemble themselves somewhat. Who is the self-portrait of someone who lost their chastity to the enemy but still holds on to vanity?

Ding Ling must have seen my postscript. In her letter to Chen Qixia, she said, "Let Guo Moruo lead the readers," which may have been her retort to me. I will accept her arrow, whether it is a cold arrow or an imperial arrow. Since she let me "lead the readers," I think my "leadership" was not wrong at all in evaluating Ding Ling. Reading less of Ding Ling's and other Rightist gentlemen's works, and being less infected by toxins, is not a loss.

I have helped Feng Xuefeng with some things he asked me to do. For example, the annotation work of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" that he presided over. He showed me the annotated manuscripts, and I did my best to offer some opinions, make some revisions, and add some supplements. Last summer, I was in Beidaihe, and he was also in Beidaihe. One day, I was seriously proofreading Lu Xun's original works and annotations, and he came to see me. He advised me: "Why do you have to be so serious? Just take a look at the annotation part." I was a little surprised at the time: "How could this person who claims to be the successor of Lu Xun say such a sloppy thing?" Now I understand that in fact, the annotation work was done by others, and he was sitting back and enjoying the fruits of their labor. He himself did not value it that much. The boastful Feng Xuefeng often liked to say that Lu Xun's contribution to the revolutionary cause was due to his inspiration. However, twenty years ago in Shanghai, the splitting of the literary and art front and the dispute over two literary and art slogans were entirely caused by Feng Xuefeng. Today, he has been exposed, but he is pushing all the responsibility onto Lu Xun. I completely agree with Comrade Xu Guangping's criticism of him: "He is still eating Lu Xun even after Lu Xun is dead."

Now I want to say more frankly that we already know that Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and others were engaged in anti-Party activities within the Party. Such people are more worthy of hatred than Rightists outside the Party. They deceived the Party and the people. They defiled the glorious title of Communist Party members and are not worthy of being engineers of the soul. Ding Ling once said that she was "legally anti-Party." I can understand her self-expression. Any Rightist who wants to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities today wears a "legal" cloak, and Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and others even wear a hat of "Party member comrades." Aren't such people worthy of being hated even more?

Rightists are generally very dark, and the fundamental reason is that they have unspeakable secrets and histories. Whether they are inside or outside the Party, whether they are in the central government or local governments, whether they are in literary and art circles or other fields, they generally have a common program of ideological action. They unite the Rightists, strive for the middle, and attack the Leftists; they consistently deny achievements, exaggerate shortcomings, and provoke contradictions. They do not want the Party's leadership, but want to seize the Party's leadership. They do not want ideological transformation, oppose Marxism, and want to restore capitalism. They do not want centralization, but want more democracy. They do not want discipline, but want more freedom. They do not want unified will, but want more personal fame and gain. The idea of fame and gain has developed to an alarming extent among the Rightists, and some people in literary and art circles have even shouted the slogan "Strive for RMB!" They are all arrogant and conceited. They are all individual careerists, some are crazy revenge-seekers, who frantically shout to kill people and set fires. They always have some groups, large and small, and even if they are solo operators, they are not isolated. These people can be said to be a class type. Their mad attacks and attempts at mad revenge are precisely the mad struggles of the dying class. If these mad revenge-seekers really seized power, wouldn't they become Jiang Jieshi, Xu Enzeng, and Dai Li the second?

Look, Li Youran, a pawn of the Ding Chen anti-Party group, even said this: "Now I realize the mood of a line in "Beating the Fisherman and Killing the Family": 'To kill his whole family is the only way to relieve the hatred in my heart!'" How crazy this is! What Xiao En hated was the landlord, and what he wanted to kill was the whole family of the landlord, while what Li Youran and other Rightists hated was the Party, and what they wanted to kill was all Party members and all Leftists. When we hear these shouts from the Rightists, it is easier to realize that the anti-Rightist struggle is a class struggle in ideology and politics, a life-and-death struggle between two lines. When we hear these shouts from the Rightists, it is easier to realize that no leniency is allowed in the struggle against the Rightists. If you are lenient, he will not be lenient. Allowing leniency and allowing the Rightists to develop, we will not only lose our heads, but also lose our country, and make our country return to the old state of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, and be ruled by imperialism.

Although the Rightists want to kill us, we do not want to kill them in our counterattack against the Rightists, but to save them. We hope that they can come to their senses, carry out socialist self-transformation, and return to the ranks of the people. We want to take this opportunity to clarify major issues of right and wrong, launch a nationwide debate, and carry out socialist education extensively and deeply, to educate ourselves, educate our future generations, and educate everyone at home and abroad who is willing to accept the truth.

There is no doubt that the Rightists are poisonous weeds, but they can be used as fertilizer and can also be our "teachers." Their path of development is really worth learning from. The People's Daily editorial on September 1 has this section:

"Why do these 'old writers' and 'old Party members' in literary and art circles dare to be so lawless and engage in anti-Party activities for a long time? In addition to the fact that they have deeply rooted bourgeois individualism as the ideological source, the Party organizations in literary and art circles have not strictly supervised them, and often adopted a tolerant and sentimental attitude when criticizing and handling their erroneous thoughts and actions, which is also one of the important reasons. This is a serious lesson."

The Party severely criticized the Rightists within the Party, and at the same time conducted self-criticism, which made me wake up and raised my vigilance. I was thinking: We are criticizing Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng today. If we do not constantly spur ourselves and do not constantly accept the Party's supervision, will we not become Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng tomorrow?

Anyone around the age of fifty who has not undergone thorough transformation and has come from the old society probably has deeply rooted bourgeois individualism. In the depths of our souls, there is not only bourgeois individualism, but also a large number of feudal landlord class ideological remnants. Although the old society has basically undergone socialist transformation, these people are still alive, and the customs and habits of the old era still exist. Even younger people cannot guarantee that they will not be affected. We generally despise labor and value reading. "All occupations are inferior, only studying is superior." "Those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others." This aristocratic idea is deeply rooted in the older generation, and is sprouting in the younger generation without their awareness. If the erroneous thoughts and actions of Party writers may sometimes be "tolerated," then the erroneous thoughts and actions of non-Party writers are even more likely to be "tolerated." What's more, we intellectuals, generally speaking, are always accustomed to tolerating ourselves. Seeing the transformation of Party writers, shouldn't non-Party writers intensify their ideological transformation through self-education?

Literary creation is originally a hard mental labor, but in its nature, it is not as arduous as physical labor. Also, since it is largely individual labor, it is easy to be detached from the masses. Perhaps it is because of the habitual emphasis on spiritual food that literary writers are also prone to fame. As long as they have one or two decent works, they are easily praised, just like winning the top prize in the imperial examination in the old era, "becoming famous all over the world at one stroke." I remember that the British poet Byron also said: "I woke up one morning and fame had spread all over the world." This can easily make some writers proud, complacent, and arrogant. Ding Ling's desire to rank herself with Leo Tolstoy is well-founded. Her "one-bookism," saying that "as long as you write a book, no one can defeat you," is also a class type of thinking. This idea is not limited to Ding Ling, not limited to the Rightists, but should be said to be held by anyone who is prone to pride and complacency.

Because of this, our great soul engineer Maxim Gorky once said: "Do not regard what you have made, shoes, chairs, books, as idols." This is not only teaching people like Ding Ling, but also teaching all mental and physical laborers. Gorky equated the work of writing books with the work of making shoes and chairs. He did not regard the work of writing books as particularly noble, but placed it below the work of making shoes and chairs. Gorky was really a bit "insulting to the cultured," but this is precisely the correct expression of the Marxist worldview. Physical labor is the mother of mental labor. Without farmers cultivating the land and without workers making shoes and chairs, our food, clothing, housing, and transportation would be a problem. How can we talk about mental labor, writing books, writing novels, writing plays, and writing poetry? Of course, Gorky has written more than one book, and he never regarded his book as an idol, let alone himself as an idol. His famous play "The Lower Depths" depicts the emotions of vagrants. Despite being widely praised, he himself said that the play contained toxins. All great writers have the spirit of humility and self-restraint like Gorky. They work diligently and create constantly, never easily self-satisfied.

Gorky often praised the German poet Goethe and his "Faust." The "Faust" tragedy is a masterpiece of the ascending stage of capitalism. The Faust in the tragedy is a symbol of the spirit of not knowing self-satisfaction. Dr. Faust made a contract with the devil in his medieval study: Before he expressed self-satisfaction, the devil would be his servant; once he expressed self-satisfaction, he would become the devil's servant. So the devil served him and took him out of the medieval study, rejuvenated him, and experienced all kinds of life without getting tired. Finally, Faust became blind from sorrow. In his blindness, he imagined the work of moving mountains and reclaiming the sea that he was engaged in, and the utopian scene of people living and working in peace and contentment in the new land. He couldn't help but admire with self-satisfaction: "Beautiful, stay awhile!" So he became the devil's servant and died. Gorky appreciated "Faust," and Lenin had a copy of "Faust" among his few favorite books when he was exiled in Siberia. I believe that the educational significance of this theme should be one of the important reasons.

Chairman Mao warned us: "Modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one lag behind." This should become the motto of each of us.

Today, we have seen that Ding Ling, the proponent of "one-bookism," and other proud and complacent Rightists have also become "servants of the devil" and have fallen into the quagmire of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. It is worth taking as a warning.

Today, we are striving to build the socialist superstructure on the basis of the socialist economic base. Literary and art workers are engineers of the soul and bear a particularly important mission. To build a new superstructure, we must destroy the old one or transform it. To forge the souls of others, we must first forge our own souls. Therefore, we must strive to carry out self-transformation, to transform ourselves into builders of socialism, to transform ourselves into intellectuals of the working class, to constantly transform ourselves, to constantly progress, and then we can avoid falling, can live up to the honorary title of "engineer of the soul," and can constantly create works with considerable political value and artistic value, and contribute to the cause of socialist construction.

How can we do this? I think that first of all, we should constantly overcome our bourgeois individualism and other backward ideas, strive to master the Marxist worldview, and serve the people and the cause of construction realistically with mental labor.

It is absolutely necessary to always be closely united around the Party, to faithfully accept the Party's leadership, and to resolutely take the socialist road. It is absolutely necessary to always maintain close contact with the working people, embody the labor spirit of workers and peasants, and develop a diligent and simple lifestyle, so that workers and peasants regard themselves as their own people. Chairman Mao wants us to "get off our horses and look at the flowers," and the Party's rectification instructions include instructions to engage in appropriate physical labor. There is no doubt that this is a concrete method to maintain close contact with the working people. This is also the only way to prevent the source of creation from drying up. Let each of us spur ourselves and spur each other.

However, personal efforts are prone to slacken. What is most necessary is to have the Party's leadership, the Party's supervision, and the Party's education. We must never tolerate ourselves, and at the same time we implore the Party not to tolerate us. Just like the current meeting, everyone, whether inside or outside the Party, should be tempered.

Today, the political basis of the new united front is socialism. We implore the Party to strengthen its leadership and strict supervision over the entire literary and art front and the entire intellectual army, not to tolerate Party writers, nor to tolerate non-Party writers, so that everyone can develop a high degree of discipline and have a strong unified will, and truly become cultural workers for socialist construction.

Comrades, I want to say it again, let us work together, spur each other, and under the leadership, supervision, and tempering of the Party, as cultural workers, fight unremittingly against any difficulties and obstacles on the road to building socialism, and strive for the comprehensive and complete victory of Marxism-Leninism!

    努力把自己改造成为无产阶级的文化工人
    （1957年9月17日在中共中国作家协会党组扩大会议上的讲话）
    郭沫若
    文艺界反右派斗争是整个反右派斗争中的一个重要战线，文艺界斗争的胜利不仅可以纯洁文艺队伍、巩固党对文艺的领导，并可以鼓舞全国各界的战斗，使社会主义教育能够更普及、更深入。我们一定要坚持继续斗争，争取彻底的胜利，使我们文艺界的每一个同志都能成为工人阶级的知识分子，过好社会主义革命这一大关。
    我早就读过9月1日人民日报的社论“为保卫社会主义文艺路线而斗争”，我是完全拥护的。在人民日报上我也不断地看到关于攻破丁陈反党集团和揭露文艺界其他右派分子的报道，认真说我每看到一次就要吃惊一次。那些右派先生们的思想、言论和行动有好些在我是完全出乎意外的。
    陈企霞和李又然等人我不熟悉，我所比较熟悉的是丁玲、冯雪峰和艾青。丁玲、冯雪峰是有二三十年党龄的老党员，雪峰还参加过二万五千里长征。我总以为他们的思想立场大概是没有问题的。即使在私生活和个人历史上有可非议的地方，但总应该是白璧微瑕、不失其为有成就、可尊敬的同志的。那晓得他们的思想、言论和行动竟那样见不得天日，但也终于见了天日。
    丁玲的作品，严格地说来，我恐怕就只读过“我在霞村的时候”那么一篇。那是在解放前1946年8月我在上海第一次读到解放区作品的时候。那时是陆定一同志给了我两本书，一本是赵树理同志的“李有才板话”，另一本是“解放区短篇创作选第一辑”。我如饥似渴地费了几小时工夫，一口气把它们读完了。我写过一篇读后感，叫“板话及其他”（见“天地玄黄”四二○页）。我说“我是完全被陶醉了，被那新颖、健康、朴素的内容与手法。这儿有新的天地、新的人物、新的感情、新的作风、新的文化。谁读了，我相信都会感觉着兴趣的。”这表现了我当时对于解放区作品的向往，对于解放区的向往。这不单是我一个人的感情，而是一般拥护党、拥护革命的人士的共同感情。我们在蒋管区是把延安当成革命圣地，延安来的作品当然就是革命的精神食粮了。但独于对丁玲的那篇“我在霞村的时候”，我却没有表示足够的赞美。我的读后感里面有这样一节：
    “创作选集里面一共收了十二个短篇，所写的都是实人实事，但比任何传奇的作品实在还要传奇。第一篇是丁玲的“我在霞村的时候”。丁玲是国内国外所熟悉的我国有数的名作家，但她的这篇作品和其他的十一篇比较起来，在手法上无宁是有逊色的。这正好是一个标准尺度，由此可以知道其他的十一位作家是已经达到了怎样高的水准”。
    这话是说得相当客气的，其实倒不仅是“手法”上的问题。“我在霞村的时候”所写的是同情对敌寇失了节、仍然抱着虚荣心的一个女子，而同时又暴露了解放区的人民好像缺乏同情。我觉得这作品是没有教育意义的，丁玲为什么要同情那样的人，而采取轻蔑人民的态度去写她。我的不满意倒是在这里，但我那时是在蒋管区，不好坦率地写出来。在今天我倒能够了解丁玲了。她之所以同情那个贞贞，事实上是在同情丁玲。画家或雕塑家的人物像往往是有点像自己的，向敌人失了节而依然抱着虚荣心，这是谁的自画像呢？
    我那篇读后感，丁玲一定是看见过的。她给陈企霞的信上说“让郭沫若去领导读者”吧，也许就是她回敬我的一枝箭。我就领受她的这一枝箭吧，不管是冷箭，还是令箭。她既然让我“领导读者”，我觉得我的“领导”在对于丁玲的评价上一点也并没有错。少读丁玲和其他右派先生们的作品，少受些毒素的感染，那倒并不是什么损失。
    冯雪峰有时候找我帮忙的事，我是帮过忙的。例如他所主持的“鲁迅全集”的注释工作，他把注释好的稿本都给我看过，我也尽我的力量提了些意见，作了些修改和补充。去年暑间我在北戴河，他也在北戴河。有一天我正把鲁迅的原作和注释认真校阅，他来看我。他劝告我：“你何必那么认真，把注释部分看一下就好了”。我当时倒有些诧异：“怎么这位自命为继承鲁迅的人会说这样马虎的话”？我现在也才明白了，事实上注释工作是别人在搞，而他是坐享其成，他自己是并不那么重视的。大言不惭的冯雪峰经常爱把鲁迅对革命事业的贡献，说成是由于他的启发。然而二十年前在上海分裂文艺战线，闹出两个文艺口号之争，完全是冯雪峰在作怪，今天被揭发了，而他却把责任全推在鲁迅身上去了。我完全同意许广平同志斥责他的话：“鲁迅死了还要吃鲁迅”。
    现在我要更坦白地说，我们已经知道丁玲、冯雪峰等人在党的内部进行反党的勾当，这样的人比起党外的右派分子来，是更值得憎恨的。他们欺骗了党，也欺骗了人民。他们污蔑了共产党员的光荣称号，不配做灵魂的工程师。丁玲曾经说她是“合法反党”，她的这个自我表白我倒是可以理解的。任何右派分子在今天要进行反党反社会主义的勾当，都披着一件“合法”的外衣，而丁玲、冯雪峰等人更戴上了一顶“党员同志”的帽子。这样的人不是值得加倍地憎恨的吗？
    右派分子一般都很阴暗，根本原因就是由于他们有不可告人的心事和历史。他们不论在党内或党外，不论在中央或地方，不论在文艺界或其它各界，大抵有共同的思想行动纲领。他们一致地团结右派、争取中间、打击左派；一致地否定成绩、夸大缺点、挑拨矛盾。他们不要党的领导，要夺取党的领导。他们不要思想改造，反对马克思主义，要使资本主义复辟。他们不要集中，要更多的民主。他们不要纪律，要更多的自由。他们不要统一意志，要更多的个人名利。名利思想在右派分子中发展到了惊人的地步，文艺界竟有人竟喊出了“为争取人民币而奋斗”的口号。他们都自高自大，不可一世。他们都是一些个人野心家，有的是疯狂的报复主义者，疯狂地公开喊叫要杀人，要放火。他们总有那么大大小小的一些集团，即使是单干户，也并不是孤立的。这些人可以说是一种阶级类型。他们的疯狂进攻并企图疯狂报复正是死亡阶级的疯狂挣扎。这些疯狂的报复主义者假使真的一旦执掌了政权，你怕他们不会成为蒋介石、徐恩曾、戴笠第二吗？
    请看，丁陈反党集团的走卒李又然他还说过这样的话：“我现在才体会到打渔杀家中的一句台词‘要杀他的全家，方消我心头之恨’的情绪”，这是多么的疯狂！萧恩所恨的是地主，所要杀的是地主的全家，而李又然和其他右派分子所恨的是党，所要杀的是全体党员和全部左派。我们听到了右派分子的这些叫嚣，才更容易体会到反右派斗争是思想上和政治上的阶级斗争，是两条路线的你死我活的斗争。我们听到了右派分子的这些叫号，也才更容易体会到反击右派分子是丝毫也不能容许温情主义的。你温情，他不温情。容许了温情主义让右派分子发展下去，我们不仅要亡头，而且要亡国，而使我们的国家回到半封建半殖民地的旧态，为帝国主义所统治。
    尽管右派分子要杀我们，我们反击右派倒并不要杀他们，而是要救活他们。我们倒希望他们能够幡然悔悟，进行社会主义的自我改造，重新回到人民的队伍里来。我们反击右派，倒是要借这个机会来辨明大是大非、展开全民大辩论，广泛地深入地进行社会主义教育，教育我们自己，教育我们后代，教育国内国外一切愿意接受真理的人。
    右派分子毫无疑问是毒草，但可以做肥料，也可以做我们的“教员”。他们的发展途径实在是很值得我们引以为教训的。9月1日人民日报社论里有这样的一节话：
    “为什么这些文艺界的‘老作家’、‘老党员’敢于这样无法无天，长期进行反党活动呢？除了因为他们有根深蒂固的资产阶级个人主义的思想根源之外，文艺界的党组织对他们监督不严，在批判和处理他们的错误思想行动的时候，往往采取了姑息和温情主义的态度，也是重要原因之一。这是严重的教训。”
    党严厉地批判了党内右派分子，而同时更进行了自我批判，这使我发生了猛省，提高了警惕。我在这样想：我们今天在批判丁玲冯雪峰，如果我们不经常鞭策自己，不经常接受党的监督，我们明天难道不会成为丁玲冯雪峰吗？
    凡是五十岁左右，未经过彻底改造、从旧社会渡过来的人，资产阶级个人主义的思想，恐怕谁也是根深蒂固的。我们的灵魂深处不仅有资产阶级个人主义，而且还会有大量的封建地主阶级的思想残余。旧社会虽然基本上经过社会主义改造，但这些人还活着，旧时代的风俗习惯还存在，即使更年青的人也不能保证不受影响。我们一般是轻视劳动，重视读书的。“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”。“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”。这种贵族老爷式的想法在老一辈人是根深蒂固，在年青一辈人在不知不觉之间也在茁发萌芽。如果党内作家的错误思想行动，有时有被“姑息”的可能，那么党外作家的错误思想行动，便更有被“姑息”的可能了。更何况我们这些知识分子，一般地说来，总是惯会自己姑息自己的。看到党内作家的蜕变，难道党外作家还不应该加紧进行自我教育的思想改造吗？
    文艺创作本来是一种辛勤的脑力劳动，但在它的性质上没有体力劳动那样艰苦，又由于大体上是个体劳动，容易与群众脱离。大约是由于习惯上重视精神食粮的原故吧，文艺作家也容易出名，只要有得一两篇像样的作品便容易受到称赞，就好像旧时代中状元名扬天下一样，“一举成名天下知”。我记得英国的诗人拜伦也说过这样的话：“一觉醒来，名声已传遍了世界”。这样就很容易使一些作家骄傲自满、不可一世。丁玲要把自己和老托尔斯泰并列，是良有以也的。她的“一本书主义”，说什么“只要写出一本书，便谁也把你打不倒”。这种思想，倒也是一种阶级类型。这种想法不限于丁玲有，不限于右派分子有，凡是容易骄傲自满的人应该说都有。
    正因为这样，所以我们的一位伟大的灵魂工程师高尔基曾经说过这样的话：“不要把你自己所做成的东西，靴子、椅子、书本子，当成偶像”。这不仅在教训丁玲那样的人，同时也在教训我们一切脑力劳动者和体力劳动者。高尔基是把做书的工作和做靴子、做椅子等工作等量齐观、一视同仁的。他没有把做书的工作看得特别高贵，而且还是把它放在做靴子、做椅子的下边的。高尔基真是有点“侮辱斯文”，但这正是马克思主义世界观的正确表现。体力劳动是脑力劳动的母亲。没有农民耕田种地，没有工人做靴子、椅子，我们的衣食住行就成问题，那里还说得上脑力劳动、做书立说、写小说、写剧本、写诗呢？当然，高尔基所做的书是不止一本了，他决不曾把自己的书当成偶像，更不曾把自己当成偶像。他的有名的剧本“夜店”是描写流浪人的情绪的，尽管受到广泛的称赞，而他自己却说那剧本含有毒素。大凡伟大的作家都有高尔基这样谦虚克己的精神，他们是勤勤恳恳，一直不断地创作，决不轻易自我满足的。
    高尔基常常称赞德国的诗人歌德和他的“浮士德”。“浮士德”悲剧是资本主义上行阶段的杰作，悲剧中那位浮士德博士就是不知道自我满足的那种精神的象征。浮士德博士在中世纪的书斋中和恶魔订下契约：在他没有表示自我满足之前，恶魔做他的奴才；待他一旦表示了自我满足之后，他便成为恶魔的奴才。于是恶魔奉侍着他走出了中世纪的书斋，返老还童，经历了种种的生活，不知厌倦。最后浮士德因忧愁而盲了目，在盲目中想像到他所从事着的移山填海的工作和在那新土地上人民安居乐业的乌托邦景象，他不禁自我满足地赞叹了一声：“美呀，停留一会！”于是他便成为恶魔的奴才而死去了。高尔基之所以欣赏“浮士德”，列宁流放在西伯利亚时在他少数爱读书中之所以也有一部“浮士德”，我相信这种主题的教育意义，应该是重要的原因之一。
    毛主席告诫我们：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。这应该成为我们每一个人的座右铭。
    今天我们已经看到“一本书主义”者的丁玲和其他骄傲自满的右派先生们也都成为了“恶魔的奴才”，而堕落到反党反社会主义的泥沼里去了。是值得我们引以为殷鉴的。
    在今天是我们在社会主义的经济基础之上努力建设社会主义的上层建筑的时候。文艺工作者是灵魂工程师，特别负有重大的使命。我们要建设新的上层建筑，就必须毁弃旧的或对旧的加以改造。我们要铸造别人的灵魂，尤必须预先铸造好自己的灵魂。因此，我们必须努力进行自我改造，要把自己改造成为社会主义的建设者，改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，要不断地改造，不断地进步，然后我们才能够免于堕落，才能够不辜负
  “灵魂工程师”的荣誉称号，才能够不断创造出政治价值与艺术价值都相当高度的作品，而对于社会主义建设事业有所贡献。
    要怎样才能够做到这样呢？我想，我们首先就应该不断地克服我们的资产阶级个人主义和其他落后思想，要努力掌握马克思主义的世界观，实事求是地以脑力劳动为人民服务，为建设事业服务。
    永远紧密地团结在党的周围，忠实地接受党的领导，坚决地走社会主义的道路，这是绝对必要的。永远紧密地与劳动人民保持联系，体现工人农民的劳动精神，养成勤俭朴素的生活作风，要让工人农民把自己当成自己人，这是绝对必要的。毛主席要我们“下马观花”，党的整风指示中有从事适当的体力劳动的指示，毫无疑问，是使我们和劳动人民保持密切联系的具体方法。这样也才能使创作的源泉不会枯涸。请让我们每一个都鞭策自己，并相互鞭策吧。
    然而个人的努力是容易懈怠的，最必要的是要有党的领导、党的监督、党的教育。我们自己决不要姑息自己，同时也恳求党决不要姑息我们。就像当前的大会一样，不论党内党外都一律加以锻炼。
    今天新的统一战线的政治基础就是社会主义。我们恳求党对于整个文艺战线、整个知识分子大军加强领导、严格监督，不姑息党内作家，也不姑息党外作家，要使大家都养成高度的纪律性并具有坚强的统一意志，真正成为社会主义建设的文化工人。
    同志们，我要再说一遍，请让我们共同努力，相互鞭策，在党的领导、监督、锻炼之下，作为一个文化工人，和建设社会主义道路上的任何困难和阻碍，永恒不懈地战斗下去，争取全面的彻底的马克思列宁主义的胜利！
