    On the Performance of "Sanmao Learns Business"
    Feng Zi

    Those who have seen "Sanmao Learns Business" all say: "It's a hilarious performance, so funny." The fact that it's a "hilarious performance" explains why it's funny.

    Two rickshaw pullers compete for business, reducing the fare from eight thousand to five hundred in order to compete. Not only that, one offers free rides, and the other pays the passenger to ride. The workers end up fighting, scaring the passenger away. This event violates normal life, so it's funny. However, the audience laughs at more than just the event itself. What attracts the audience's laughter is the actors' realistic yet exaggerated movements. Xiao Xiangfei and Wang Yifei brought the images of rickshaw pullers struggling in Shanghai to life. When the two of them argue and end up patting their bellies and shouting, this handling of the action, a caricatured exposure, profoundly reveals the painful life of the working people under the reactionary rule.

    In the second scene, "The Boss's Family," and the third scene, "Suing in Court," we see the true face of the "profession" of pickpockets, the dregs of the old society who resort to any means to survive. Sanmao, a country boy who came to the big city from the countryside, is about to have his innocent and pure childlike heart fall into the mud pit. A clumsy country kid wants to learn to be a quick-eyed, quick-handed, and quick-footed pickpocket, of course, there will be endless jokes. Wen Binbin's portrayal of Sanmao did not develop from this angle. The character of Sanmao and his situation at the time are full of contradictions, and from the script, the director, to the actors, they are not creating laughter for the sake of laughter, but are very seriously grasping the most basic aspect of the character.

    What should be done when the kind and pure Sanmao is surrounded by a circle of pickpockets who have degenerated into human scum? The conclusion is that he cannot go along with them. Although these two scenes bring constant laughter, the audience is deeply moved while laughing. Sanmao is unwilling to learn to be a pickpocket to harm people, and he is unwilling to file a lawsuit to deceive people. He returns a package of banknotes that someone else grabbed and stuffed into his hand. Sanmao uses his actions to oppose the evil forces that are luring him to degenerate. Scenes two and three are the starting point of Sanmao's learning business, and this thread runs through all six scenes, all revealing the contradictions of class society under reactionary rule through Sanmao's righteous actions.

    Merely grasping the character's kindness, innocence, and purity may not be enough to complete the creation of the role of Sanmao. For example, Xiao Ying is also kind, innocent, and pure, isn't she? As the core of the role of Sanmao, the main thing is the aspect of resistance. Sanmao is not submissive. He is observing life and growing in life. For example, when his adopted sister agrees with the pickpocket A-Da to take him in, and the pickpocket A-Da looks him up and down with his chest puffed out and his arms akimbo, he also puffs out his chest and puts his arms akimbo in response. He is a child, and children have the instinct to imitate. The action itself is funny, and the child's childishness is also laughable. What is even more laughable is that such a child makes such a movement. At this time, this movement shows that the child is unwilling to be manipulated. Therefore, the audience's laughter at this time contains sympathy, but more is encouragement and praise.

    Wen Binbin very accurately grasped the spirit of the character Sanmao, and very accurately used physical movements to express the image of Sanmao. It can be said that he created this character very perfectly. The accuracy of the movements is the biggest feature of this play, which is prominently manifested in the fourth scene, in the barbershop. Wen Binbin's art reached its peak here, and it also shows that an actor's artistic cultivation cannot be separated from technical training. Here, we must also mention Liu Xiasheng, who plays the owner of the barbershop. The cooperation between the two of them can be described as "seamless," so perfect! Their every movement is so organically linked, a raise of the hand, a lift of the foot, a somersault, rolling onto the chair... Of course, these movements are very exaggerated, but they are not exaggerated to the point of being detached from the character or the play, but more accurately complete the role's task in that scene. One is learning earnestly, and the other is teaching earnestly. The master has a bad temper, and Sanmao is clumsy, so jokes emerge one after another. In the midst of great laughter, the purpose and significance that the script wants to reveal are also accepted. We saw the painful apprentice life, and we saw the life of working people struggling on the edge of starvation. Therefore, while hating the barber and his wife for abusing the apprentice, we can't help but sympathize with them.

    What also moved me was the sixth scene, a scene between Sanmao and Xiao Ying. Xiao Ying is hungry, and Sanmao gives her something to eat. Xiao Ying thinks it's not enough, and Sanmao raises his hand, leaving half of what he has, and says: "This is for tomorrow's food." Xiao Ying understands that Sanmao would rather starve himself to take care of her. Xiao Ying, a child who was sold to someone else as a servant since she was little and has suffered all kinds of abuse, truly receives the warmth of a sibling. She is so moved that she cries, and she cries and says, "I will never leave you again." Who can not be deeply moved by this pure emotion? The character of Sanmao is even more perfect through this scene.

    In terms of scriptwriting, this scene has a unique approach to character portrayal. Xiao Ying wants to repay Sanmao, but in reality, she wants to satisfy that pitiful fantasy. She imagines how much money she will earn, and all this money must be given to Sanmao. One wants to give, and the other refuses to accept. It's clearly a fantasy! The two of them earnestly push back and forth. Nengniang, who plays Xiao Ying, appropriately portrays the innocent and lively image of the little girl. It's just that this short scene, although the actors shed tears on stage, is not moving enough. If the character is truly moved by this scene, even without tears, the character's emotions will be better conveyed to the audience. More audience members will shed tears for Xiao Ying.

    In addition to Wen Binbin and other comrades, Xia Jing's landlady, Fan Haha's Wu Blind, Yu Xiangming's pickpocket boss, Chen Jian's pedestrian, and Xing Haha's tofu flower vendor all have unique contributions. Some have few scenes but complete the character's task very well. However, individual comrades seem to focus too much on performing the image.

    The stage setting is part of the artistic creation, and this requirement is well fulfilled in this play. The large "Pawn" character in the third scene and the large "Rice" character written on the right side of the mountain wall in the fourth scene vividly express the historical era that the script wants to express. The overall design is simple and harmonious.

    The artistic achievement of "Sanmao Learns Business" cannot be summarized by this short article. This only discusses personal observations, which are of course very immature and incomplete.

    谈“三毛学生意”的演出
    凤子
    看过“三毛学生意”的人都说：“演的滑稽，真好笑”。演的滑稽，这个“演”字就说明了为什么笑。
    两个黄包车工友抢生意，为了竞争，车价从八千块减到五百块，这还不算，一个不要钱，一个倒贴坐客，工友们打起来了，乘客给吓跑了。这事件，是违反正常的生活规律的，所以好笑，然而观众笑的不止是事件本身，吸引观众笑的，是演员真实而又夸大的动作。筱翔飞和王一飞将挣扎在上海滩上黄包车工友的形象演活了，当两人吵到最后拍着肚子喊叫起来了时，这一动作的处理、漫画化地深刻暴露了反动统治下劳动人民的惨痛生活。
    第二场老大家和第三场告地状，我们看到为了生活到不择手段的地步、旧社会中的渣滓扒手这一“行业”的真面目。从农村来到大城市的乡下孩子三毛，天真纯洁的童心，眼看要掉到泥坑里了。土头土脑、笨手笨脚的乡下孩子要学成一个眼快、手快、腿快的扒手，当然要笑话百出。文彬彬演的三毛并没有从这个角度发展，三毛这个人物和他当时的处境充满了矛盾，而从剧本、导演到演员并不是为了笑而制造笑，却是非常严肃地掌握了人物最基本的一面。
    善良而又纯洁的三毛被包围在堕落为人类渣滓的扒手的圈子里，怎么办？结论是不能同流合污。尽管这两场戏招来不断的笑声；笑的同时观众却深深的感动了。三毛不愿学扒手去害人，不愿告地状去骗人，将别人抢来塞到自己手里的一包钞票退给人，三毛用行动反对诱引自己堕落的恶势力。二、三两场是三毛学生意的起点，整个六场戏都贯串着这一根线，都是通过三毛的正义行动来揭露反动统治下阶级社会的矛盾。
    仅仅掌握人物的善良、天真和纯洁，恐怕还不能完成三毛这个角色的创造。比如小英，不也是善良、天真和纯洁的么？作为三毛这个角色的核心，主要的还有反抗的一面。三毛不是逆来顺受的，他在观察生活，在生活中成长。例如过房阿姊同扒手阿大说妥了收留他，扒手阿大挺胸叉腰打量他一番、他也照样挺胸叉腰回敬对方。他是孩子，孩子有摹仿的本能，动作本身就好笑，加上孩子的稚气也是可笑的。更可笑的是，这么个孩子来这样一个动作，这时候这个动作说明了这个孩子是不甘心受人摆布的。因此观众这时的笑有同情，更多的是鼓励和赞美。
    文彬彬非常准确的掌握了三毛这个人物的精神面貌，又非常准确的运用形体动作表现了三毛的形象。可以说非常完美的创造了这个人物。动作的准确是这个戏最大的特点，突出的表现在第四场，在剃头店那一场里。文彬彬的艺术在这里达到了高峰，同时也看出一个演员的艺术修养离不开技术锻炼。这里也必须提到饰理发店老板的刘侠声，他们两人配合的可以说是“天衣无缝”，那样的完美！他们的每一个动作是那样有机的联系起来，一举手、一抬足、翻个斤斗、滚到椅上……当然这些动作是非常夸大的，但并未夸大到脱离人物、脱离戏，而是更准确地完成了角色在那一场戏里的任务。一个是在认真的学，一个是在认真的教。师父脾气不好，三毛又手脚不灵，因而笑料层出不已。就在大笑声中，也接受了剧本所要揭示的目的和意义。我们看到了惨痛的学徒生活，看到了挣扎在饥饿边沿上劳动人民的生活。因此，对理发师和他的老婆虐待学徒，愤恨时也不禁同情他们。
    使我受到感动的还有第六场，三毛和小英的一场戏；小英饿了，三毛给她东西吃，小英嫌少，三毛举手上留下的一半说：“这是明天的粮食”。小英明白了三毛为了照顾她宁可自己挨饿。从小被卖给人家做丫头，受尽了虐待的孩子小英，真正得到了像手足一样的温暖。她感动得哭，她哭着说“再也不离开你”。这种纯洁的感情，谁能不深深为之感动呢？三毛这个人物通过这一场也就更其完美。
    在剧本创作方面，这一场戏对人物刻划有独到的地方。小英为了要报答三毛，实际上是要满足那可怜的幻想，她想像自己会挣多少多少钱，这些钱一定要给三毛。一个要给，一个不受，明明是幻想呵！两人都那么认真的推让起来。演小英的嫩娘，恰如其分地演出了小姑娘天真烂漫的形象。只是这一小段戏，虽然演员在台上掉眼泪，可是却还不够感动人，角色如果真正为这一场戏所感动，即使没有眼泪，角色的感情会更好地传达给观众的。会有更多的观众为小英掉泪的。
    除了文彬彬等几位同志外，夏静的老板娘，范哈哈的吴瞎子，俞祥明的扒手老大，陈坚的行人，邢哈哈的卖豆腐花的等都有独到的地方。有的戏不多却很好的完成了角色的任务，不过，个别同志似乎过于着重于表演形象。
    舞台装置是艺术创造的一部分，这个要求在这个戏里完成的很好。第三场当中一个大当字，第四场右侧山墙上写的一个大米字，画龙点晴地表现了剧本所要表现的历史时代。整个设计简单又和谐。
    “三毛学生意”的艺术成就，不是我这篇短文所能概括的，这里只谈谈个人的观感，当然是很不成熟，也很不全面的。
