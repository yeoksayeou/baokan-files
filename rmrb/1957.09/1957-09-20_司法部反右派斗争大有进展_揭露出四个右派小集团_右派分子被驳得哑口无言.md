　　Great Progress in the Ministry of Justice's Anti-Rightist Struggle
　　Four Rightist Cliques Exposed; Rightist Elements Left Speechless
    (Our dispatch) Recently, the anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Justice has made great progress. The number of Rightist elements exposed has more than doubled compared to July, and three Rightist cliques headed by Zhang Yugen, Cheng Ming, and Wang Zongxian, respectively, and an intra-Party Rightist clique headed by Deputy Section Chief Wang Zuoping (Communist Party member) have been successively unearthed.
    The intra-Party Rightist clique headed by Wang Zuoping is actually the spokesperson of the Rightist elements outside the Party within the Party. They frequently spread fallacies against the Party and socialism. They slandered that "socialist transformation was done too early and ruined." They advocated that lawyers should have an "open free market." This anti-Party clique also openly attacked the Party's cadre policy, opposed the standard of selecting cadres with both ability and integrity, saying that this was "burying talent," and they wanted to implement an "examination system" to remove veteran cadres, etc. The Second Division of the Ordinary Courts of the Ministry of Justice had already been usurped by these Rightist elements.
    Cheng Ming and Wang Zongxian are the leaders of two Rightist groups in the Law Publishing House. Cheng Ming colluded with another Rightist element, Yue Jun, and took advantage of some shortcomings in the leadership's work in the publishing house to vehemently scold the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. They conspired to overthrow and usurp the Party's leadership by organizing a "Committee of Publishing Affairs" through democratic inspection. In order to expand their anti-Party and anti-socialist momentum, these Rightist elements also tried their best to win over and utilize those who were politically backward and dissatisfied with the Party, and went everywhere to incite trouble. In the early stage of the rectification movement, Rightist element Yue Jun not only frantically attacked veteran cadres within the Law Publishing House, saying that "veteran cadres are blocking the social trend," and insulted Party members, Youth League members, and activists, but also ran to the People's Publishing House to instigate those who were struggled against or investigated during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns to "cry out their grievances." The Communist Youth League branch of the Law Publishing House completely deteriorated under the rampant attacks of the Rightists. Most of the Youth League members had become members of the two Rightist groups headed by Cheng Ming and Wang Zongxian, and individual Party members had also become spokespersons for the Rightist elements within the Party.
    The Rightist group headed by Zhang Yugen openly clamored to abolish the Party and Youth League organizations, saying that "now there are organizations such as the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and the Young Pioneers in society, artificially dividing people into many compartments and levels, which inevitably leads to factionalism." They slandered our judicial work as "having no law to rely on and not abiding by the law," saying that "now there are only policies and no laws." The people's courts judge cases based on the Party and the state's policies, "which means not abiding by the law and not basing decisions on the law." They said, "The old laws of the Kuomintang are also a family, and they should be allowed to contend," and they advocated that the new and old laws should "sing opposing tunes." This Rightist group tried its best to attack the Party's leadership over judicial work, slandering that "the Ministry of Justice has only solved the problem of a bicycle in the past few years," and "the entire structure of the Ministry of Justice is a bureaucratic institution" because "everything is at the command of the Party Central Committee" and "it cannot make its own decisions," attempting to make the Ministry of Justice break away from the Party's leadership.
    The rampant attacks of the Rightist elements aroused great indignation among the vast number of cadres in the Ministry of Justice. Many comrades cited the many laws promulgated by the state since liberation and the great achievements of judicial work, and resolutely refuted their reactionary fallacies, making the Rightist elements speechless and forced to admit that they were "creating something out of nothing, spreading rumors and slanders, and harboring ulterior motives." Some Rightist elements have already bowed their heads and confessed their crimes. However, there are still a few Rightist elements who are still quibbling and resisting, making a last-ditch struggle. The Ministry is continuing to conduct reasoning and struggle against them.

### 司法部反右派斗争大有进展  揭露出四个右派小集团　右派分子被驳得哑口无言

　　司法部反右派斗争大有进展
　　揭露出四个右派小集团　右派分子被驳得哑口无言
    本报讯　最近，司法部的反右派斗争取得了很大的进展，揭发出来的右派分子比7月份增加了一倍多，并且先后挖出了以张玉根、程铭、王宗贤等为首的三个右派小集团和一个以副处长王左平（共产党员）为首的党内右派小集团。
    以王左平为首的党内右派小集团，实际是党外右派分子在党内的代言人，经常散播反党反社会主义的谬论，他们污蔑“社会主义改造搞早搞坏了”，他们主张对律师要“开放自由市场”。这个反党集团还公开攻击党的干部政策，反对德才兼备的选拔干部的标准，说这是“埋没人才”，他们要实行“考试制度”，让老干部下台等等。司法部的普通法院司第二处早已被这些右派分子篡夺了。
    程铭、王宗贤是法律出版社两个右派集团的首领。程铭勾结另一右派分子岳军，利用出版社领导工作中的一些缺点，大骂共产党、共青团，阴谋通过民主检查，另行组织“社务委员会”来推翻和篡夺党的领导。这些右派分子为了扩大他们反党反社会主义的声势，他们还竭力拉拢和利用那些政治上落后、对党有不满的人，到处进行点火。右派分子岳军在整风初期不仅在法律出版社内疯狂攻击老干部，说“老干部挡住了社会潮流”，辱骂党团员和积极分子，并且跑到人民出版社去煽动那些“三反”“肃反”中被斗被审查的人“起来喊冤”。法律出版社的共青团支部，在右派的猖狂进攻下，完全变了质，大部分团员已分别成为程铭和王宗贤为首的两个右派集团的成员，个别党员也成了右派分子在党内的代言人。
    以张玉根为首的右派集团公开叫嚣要取消党、团组织，说“现在社会上有共产党、共青团、少先队等组织，人为地把人们划分成许多格子、等级，就必然有宗派主义”，污蔑我们的司法工作是“无法可依、有法不依”，说“现在只有政策，没有法律”，人民法院判案以党和国家的政策作指导，“就是不守法律，不据法律”，他们说“国民党的旧法也是一家，应该让它争鸣”，他们主张新旧法“唱对台戏”。这个右派集团竭力攻击党对司法工作的领导，污蔑“司法部的工作几年来就只解决了一辆自行车”，“司法部整个机构就是官僚机构”，其原因是“一切听命于党中央”、“自己作不了主”，企图使司法部脱离党的领导。
    右派分子猖獗的进攻，激起了司法部的广大干部极大的愤慨，许多同志列举了解放以来国家颁布的许多法律和司法工作的巨大成就，对他们的反动谬论进行了坚决的驳斥，使得右派分子张口结舌，不得不承认自己是“无中生有，造谣污蔑，别有用心”。有的右派分子已经低头认罪。但目前还有少数右派分子仍在狡辩抵赖，进行最后挣扎，部里正在对他们继续进行说理斗争。
