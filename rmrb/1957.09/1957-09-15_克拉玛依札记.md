　　Notes from Karamay
　　By Our Correspondent Shen Shi

　　Water
    I have visited Karamay more than once. Every time I came to this nationally-renowned oilfield, Yuan Song, the receptionist of the Mining Bureau, would always enthusiastically find me a place to sleep in a tent or dugout. This July, I came here again. Old Yuan arranged my accommodation in the guesthouse and led me to the washroom. I turned on the tap, and a stream of cool water flowed out continuously. I stared in a daze. My mood was both excited and thrilled. Beloved water! You have finally flowed from the side of the Manas River, through forty-two kilometers of seamless steel pipes, to the foot of Mount Genghis Khan. Last year at this time, wasn't everyone keeping a basin of water under their beds every day? In the morning, they would wash their faces with this basin of water; after returning from the construction site, they would wipe the mud and dust off their faces with this basin of water; after washing their feet at night, they would still use this basin of water to wash their dirty socks. Water was so precious! People cherished it because it was transported from afar by trucks. In those days when they relied entirely on trucks for water, the drilling workers worried when the water supply couldn't keep up, the cooks were anxious, and the truck drivers worked day and night. At the Mining Bureau and Party Committee meetings, how many times was it put on the urgent agenda. When it was decided to lay water pipes, Soviet expert Sudri led the hydrological surveying team to find water sources in uninhabited areas and select the route for the water pipes. When the water was brought to the oilfield and the weather warmed, the Director of the Mining Bureau, Qin Feng, and the Chief Engineers, Shi Jiuguang and Li Guangcheng, repeatedly traveled to the Manas River to repeatedly study how to prevent mountain floods from destroying the pumping stations on the riverbank. When the dry season was approaching, they were again thinking of ways to ensure the normal supply of water. Some of the staff in Karamay came from Jiangnan. In their hometowns, every village was surrounded by green water. Only when they arrived here did they realize how difficult it was to get water.

　　Oil
    Chief Geologist Zhang Kai told me that in 1954, Soviet expert Comrade Uvarov was engaged in geological reconnaissance in the Karamay and Urho areas. The exposed oil seepages at the foot of Mount Genghis Khan and the thirty-kilometer-long asphalt veins in Urho aroused his great interest. When he analyzed the geological data, he said confidently to his teammates: "There must be oil underground." He suggested drilling a row of exploratory wells from Karamay to the Manas River. When he was about to leave our country, he said to the comrades of the Geological Survey Department of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration: "It's a pity that I can't personally see the drilling of the first exploratory well in Karamay, nor can I see the oil coming out." After returning to the Soviet Union, he wrote to Zhang Kai saying: "If the first exploratory well does not produce oil, don't be discouraged, continue drilling, there will always be oil."

    A year after expert Uvarov left our country, the first exploratory well, whose location he had personally determined in Karamay, gushed out crude oil. To this day, thirty exploratory wells have been completed in Karamay, and all of them have produced crude oil. Fifteen exploratory wells that are currently being drilled have taken out oil-bearing cores or have oil and gas shows. Some of the exploratory wells drilled from Karamay to the Manas River have already produced oil. Along the ninety-kilometer line from Karamay to Urho, a derrick stands every short distance. Newly built roads connect the main exploratory wells like spiderwebs. I calculated the time. From the drilling of the first exploratory well to the gushing of oil from thirty exploratory wells, it was only two years. If expert Uvarov had the opportunity to revisit Karamay, he would immediately discover that the Gobi Desert where he had pitched his tent and the wilderness where he had hunted gazelles were very different from before.

　　City
    Last spring, when Comrade Qin Feng first arrived, his office was a wooden shack. These wooden shacks were towed from the Dushanzi Oil Mine by tractors. The dugout where the Chief Engineer of the Drilling Office, Wang Bingcheng, Engineer Wu Hualiang, and Mechanic Chen Jiaxun lived, had no room to turn around after placing three beds. The dugout was surrounded by tents. The post office, bank, and trading company were all located in tents. Within a few short months, a city composed of tents and dugouts appeared at the foot of Mount Genghis Khan.

    The hospital ward was also a tent, only the operating room and pharmacy were wooden shacks. On the evening of September 26, the condition of a hospitalized patient in the Transportation Station suddenly deteriorated. After fluoroscopy and diagnosis, he was suspected of having a stomach or gallbladder perforation. Doctor Wang Jingchang put on sterilized clothes and was preparing to operate on the patient when suddenly a strong wind blew, the power lines were broken, and the glass windows of the operating room were shattered, contaminating the sterilized instruments. The patient's breathing and pulse were weak, and his condition further deteriorated. If it was delayed, his life would be in danger. Someone suggested sending him to Dushanzi Hospital, but Wang Jingchang said: "The wind is strong, and the road is bad, the patient may die on the way!" He insisted on performing the operation on the spot. But the room was pitch black, how could he operate? He immediately asked the power station workers to install batteries and electric lights in the room; more than a dozen doctors and nurses were busy nailing the windows with wooden boards and re-sterilizing the operating room; the drivers of the Transportation Station gave the patient a blood transfusion. By the time the operation started, it was already dawn.

    This year, rows of pink or dark yellow houses have appeared at the foot of Mount Genghis Khan, which are residences, canteens, offices, and clubs. The shelves of the Xinhua Bookstore are filled with newly arrived books. You can buy your favorite daily necessities from the trading company. The busy post office receives and sends more than 3,000 letters every day. The well-equipped hospital has more than ninety beds, and the number of doctors and nurses has increased to more than sixty. Dr. Wang Jingchang no longer needs to operate on patients in the wooden shack. Wang Bingcheng's room is clean and elegant. It turns out that his wife, Zhong Shan, has also been transferred from the Dushanzi Mining Bureau to Karamay. On the west-facing windowsill, there are two flower pots. The seeds of balsam and autumn chrysanthemum that Zhong Shan brought back from Ningxiang, Hunan, have already blossomed beautifully in the pots. In Urho, which used to be only the winter residence of Mongolian herdsmen, the newly built houses and low earthen houses are in stark contrast. I calculated the time. It took only a year for Karamay to transform from the laying of the foundation of the first building to the formation of a city.

　　People
    The sun shone through the thin clouds onto the Gobi Desert. The deep trenches dug by the ditching machine extended from the Manas River to Karamay. Water pipes coated with asphalt lay in the trenches like giant pythons. Uyghur worker Sebibula was driving a bulldozer to fill in the deep trenches. An old worker with a Mahe cigarette in his mouth stood next to the bulldozer, constantly directing. He had a pocket hanging on his left shoulder. I walked up to him and asked, "Are you Comrade Wang Shiyuan?"

    "Yes! Do you have something to ask me?" When he spoke, I noticed that his incisors had fallen out. He opened the pocket, which was full of screws, rivets, welding rods, steel blocks... These were all picked up by him on the road after starting work in the morning. He took out a welding rod and said slowly: "How much does it cost to buy a kilogram of welding rods, you can calculate it."

    That night, I went to his dormitory and found a burlap sack under his bed, filled with the "waste" he had picked up. Since 1955, this old worker has been consciously dealing with these wastes. In that year alone, he picked up four large boxes, totaling more than two hundred kilograms.

    When I said goodbye to him, I was deeply moved when I thought of the equipment in the burlap sack and the meaningful words he said on the construction site. Wasn't a screw, a rivet, a welding rod transported from a distant place? When the equipment supply was not up to par, how many people tried every means to save equipment. The drilling team led by drilling technician Lin Yuxiang saved 3,600 meters of seamless steel pipe by reducing the number of casing layers when drilling an exploratory well on the bank of the Manas River. Chapter Yijun, Li Shulian and Yang Liren, the laboratory technicians in the mud laboratory, proposed using loess instead of barite when preparing the mud for drilling. A catty of barite is worth two catties of flour, and barite is more expensive than flour!

    It has been more than a month since I left Karamay. Whenever I think of the thriving oilfield construction and the dusty, tireless people, how unforgettable I am in the days of parting!

　　克拉玛依札记
　　本报记者  沈石
　　水
    访问克拉玛依不止一次了，每次到了这全国瞩目的油田，矿务局的招待员原松和总是热情地在那帐篷或者地窝子里，给我找个睡觉的地方。今年7月，我又来到这里，老原在招待所给我安排好住处后，引我到洗脸室。我拧开水管的龙头，一股清凉的水不断向外流。我呆望得出神。我的心情，又兴奋，又激动。可爱的水啊！你终于由玛纳斯河边经过四十二公里的无缝钢管流到成吉斯汗山脚下了。去年这个时候，人们的床下，每天不是放着一盆水吗？早上洗脸，用这盆水；从工地回来，擦擦满脸的泥尘，用这盆水；晚上洗好脚，还要拿这盆水洗一洗弄脏的袜子。水，多么可贵啊！人们珍惜它，因为它是从远处用汽车装运来的。在那完全依靠汽车运水的日子里，水供应不上的时候，钻井工人为它发愁，炊事员为它着急，汽车司机为它日夜奔忙，在矿务局和党委会的会议上，有多少次将它列入紧急的议程里。当决定铺设水管的时候，苏联专家苏德力领着水文测量队员，到那没有人烟的地方寻找水源，选择水管经过的线路。水引到了油田，天暖冰消，矿务局局长秦峰、总工程师史久光、李光澂多次来往玛纳斯河边，反复研究要怎样防范山洪冲毁河岸上的抽水泵房。枯水期快来的时候，他们又在想办法保证水的照常供应。克拉玛依的职工有的从江南来，在他们的故乡，每个村庄，绿水环绕，到了这里，他们才体会到水来得多么不容易。
　　油
    总地质师张恺告诉我：1954年，苏联专家乌瓦洛夫同志在克拉玛依、乌尔禾一带从事地质普查，那成吉斯汗山下的露头油苗和乌尔禾绵延三十公里的沥青脉，引起他很大的兴趣。他分析地质资料时，曾满怀信心地向同队的人说：“这地下一定有油。”他建议从克拉玛依到玛纳斯河边开钻一排探井。他快离开我国的时候，对新疆石油管理局地质调查处的同志们说：“可惜我不能亲眼看到克拉玛依第一口探井开钻，也不能看到出油。”回到苏联，他写信给张恺说：“如果第一口探井没有出油，不要灰心，继续钻探下去，总会有油的。”
    乌瓦洛夫专家离开我国后一年，他在克拉玛依亲自定好井位的第一口探井就喷出了原油。到今天，克拉玛依已经完钻的探井，有三十口喷出原油。正在钻进的探井，有十五口取出了含油的岩心或有油气显示。从克拉玛依到玛纳斯河开钻的探井，有的已经喷油。从克拉玛依到乌尔禾长达九十公里的线上，隔不多远，便竖起一座井架。新修的公路像蛛网一样把主要的探井连接起来。我计算一下时间，从第一口探井开钻到三十口探井喷油，只不过两年，如果乌瓦洛夫专家有机会重游克拉玛依，那他一定马上发现当年他撑过帐篷的戈壁，猎过黄羊的荒原，面貌和从前大不相同了。
　　城
    去年春天，秦峰同志初来时，他的办公室是一间木板房。这样的木板房，还是用拖拉机从独山子油矿拖来的。钻井处总工程师王炳诚、工程师吴华梁和机械师陈家巽住的那间地窝子，摆上三张床，便没有回旋的余地了。地窝子的周围撑满了帐篷。邮局、银行、贸易公司，都设在帐篷里。短短几个月内，成吉斯汗山下出现了一座帐篷和地窝子组成的城。
    医务所的病房也是帐篷，只有手术室和药剂室是木板房。9月26日晚上，运输站一位住院的病人，病情突然恶化了。经过透视和诊断，他患的可能是胃或胆囊穿孔。医生王景昶穿好消过毒的衣服，正准备给病人动手术，突然狂风大作，电线吹断了，手术室的玻璃窗粉碎了，消过毒的器械弄脏了。病人的呼吸和脉搏微弱，病情更形恶化，如果拖延下去，就有生命的危险。有人建议送往独山子医院，王景昶说：“风大，路又不好，病人可能死在途中！”他坚持就地动手术。可是房内一片漆黑，怎能开刀呢？只好立即请电站的工人在房内安装电瓶和电灯；十多位医生和护士忙着用木板钉好窗户，将手术室重新消毒；运输站的司机给病人输血，等到开刀，天已亮了。
    今年，成吉斯汗山下出现了一排排粉红色的或深黄色的房屋，那是住宅、食堂、办公室和俱乐部。新华书店的书架上，陈列着新运来的图书。从贸易公司可以买到喜爱的日用品。繁忙的邮局每天收发三千多封信。设备完善的医院，有九十多张病床，医生和护士增添到六十余名。王景昶医生也不用在木板房内给病人动手术了。王炳诚的房间收拾得很干净，很雅致，原来他的妻子钟珊也由独山子矿务局调到克拉玛依来了。那朝西的窗台上，摆着两个花盆，钟珊从湖南宁乡捎回的凤仙花和延秋菊种子，在盆内已经开出了美丽的花朵。在乌尔禾，从前只是蒙古族牧民冬季居住的地方，新落成的住宅和低矮的土房，成了鲜明的对照。我计算一下时间，克拉玛依从第一栋房屋奠定好地基到蔚然成为一座城，也不过一年。
　　人
    太阳透过薄薄的云层照在戈壁上，挖沟机挖好的深沟，从玛纳斯河边一直延伸到克拉玛依，用沥青涂过的水管像巨蟒一样躺在沟里。维吾尔族工人色比布拉开着推土机在填平深沟。一位年老的工人嘴里含着马合烟卷，站在推土机旁边不停地指挥着。他的左肩上挂着一个口袋。我走近他身旁，问道：“你是王士元同志吗？”
    “是！你有事找我吗？”他说话的时候，我发觉他的门齿已经脱落了。他打开口袋，原来尽是些螺丝、铆钉、焊条、钢块……。这些都是他早上出工后在路上拾来的。他拿出一根焊条，慢吞吞地说：“一公斤焊条，买起来要花多少钱，你算一算。”
    当天晚上，我到了他的宿舍，发现他的床下有一个麻布口袋，里面装满了他拾来的“废料”。从1955年以来，这位老工人有意识地和这些废料打着交道，就在这一年，他拾了四大箱，共合二百多公斤。
    我跟他告别的时候，想到那麻布口袋里的器材，想到他在工地上所说的那句意味深长的话，我深受感动。一个螺丝，一个铆钉，一根焊条，不是从遥远的地方运来的吗？当器材供应不上的时候，有多少人千方百计地在想尽办法来节省器材。钻井技师林玉祥领导的钻井队，在钻进玛纳斯河边一口探井时，少下两层套管，就节省了无缝钢管三千六百公尺。泥浆化验室的化验员章贻俊、李淑廉和杨立人，在调配钻井用的泥浆时，提出用黄土代替重晶石，一斤重晶石值两斤面粉，重晶石比面粉还昂贵哩！
    告别克拉玛依又有一个多月了，每当我想起那方兴未艾的油田建设，想到那些风尘仆仆不辞劳倦的人，在离别的日子里，我是怎样的念念难忘呵！                  ·苗地插画·
