    Erratum
    Regarding the article "History Records It Thus" on the fifth page of this newspaper on September 2nd, the author has sent a letter making the following corrections:
    ① In the second part, under "Unpleasant Memories of the Past," in the seventeenth and eighteenth lines, "but only five ineffective Guihai Dams were built on the Grand Canal, which diverted water into farmland," should be changed to "not only was the Huai River not seriously治理 (zhìlǐ - governed/managed), but the five Guihai Dams without water passages built on the Grand Canal during the Qing Dynasty were repeatedly opened."
    ② In the third part, under "Unprecedented Event in Chinese Water Conservancy History," in the seventh and eighth lines, after "these twelve large reservoirs that have been built and are under construction," the phrase "plus plain-area depression flood storage projects" should be added.
    ③ In the fourth part, under "In order to tame the Huai, Han, and other rivers," in the seventh paragraph, third line, "fifty cubic meters" should be "three hundred and fifty cubic meters."
    ④ In the fifth part, under "The flood tested two different social systems," in the seventeenth line, "715.4 million mu" should be "71,540 mu."

    来函更正
    9月2日本报第五版“历史是这样记载的”一文，作者来函作如下几点更正：
    ①第二部分“不堪回首话往昔”以下第十七、十八行“但只在运河上修了五座没起作用反而把水归入农田的归海坝”，应改为“不但没有认真治淮，反而重复地开放清朝在运河上兴建的水无通路的五座归海坝”。
    ②第三部分“中国水利史上从来没有的事”以下第七、八行“这十二座已建成和正在施工的大型水库”后面应添“加上平原洼地蓄洪工程”一句。
    ③第四部分“为了使江淮河汉驯服”一段以下第七小段第三行“五十公方”应为“三百五十公方”。
    ④第五部分“洪水考验了两种不同的社会制度”以下第十七行“七亿一千五百四十万亩”应为“七万一千五百四十亩”。
