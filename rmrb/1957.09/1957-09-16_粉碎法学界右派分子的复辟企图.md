　　Smash the Rightist Elements in the Legal Field's Attempt to Restore the Old Order
　　Han Youtong
　　Since last year, rightist elements in the legal field in Shanghai, Beijing, and other places have been engaging in activities to support the old laws under the guise of academic discussions. They have been propagating that there is a "continuity" between the laws of the exploiting classes and the laws of socialism. That is to say, the latter must inherit from the former, which is an objective law, and violating it will lead to a state of anarchy where "cadres have no laws to follow and the people have no laws to abide by"! Obviously, they are not genuinely engaged in academic discussions, but are playing a political conspiracy. If their主張s win out, they can further openly advocate the restoration of reactionary old laws, the resurgence of old judicial personnel who will once again hold high positions and wield great power, oppress the people, and serve counter-revolutionaries. This kind of political conspiratorial activity is actually a prelude to their comprehensive offensive during the rectification campaign.
　　As expected, with the advent of the situation of "blooming and contending," they considered it an even better opportunity to attack. Thus, the plot was revealed, and the mask of "scholars" was torn off, exposing their ferocious faces. They launched a comprehensive and rampant offensive, gleefully believing that they could now restore the role of the old laws, restore the status of old judicial personnel, seize leadership in the judicial sphere, and enable reactionary forces to restore the old order in the judiciary, in order to weaken and ultimately overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship.
　　The spearhead of the rightist elements' attack is, first of all, directed at the legal system. They slander us as having "no laws," unanimously shouting "no laws to follow, no laws to abide by," and loudly clamoring "to establish a legal system," attempting to turn the rectification movement into an anti-socialist legal system movement, to restore the reactionary old legal system.
　　Their reactionary attempts and absurd pronouncements must be severely rebuffed.
　　After the nationwide liberation, we announced the abolition of the pseudo-Six Codes and successively formulated many laws and regulations concerning various aspects. These laws and regulations were all formulated to adapt to the economic base and political demands of our transition period. They consolidated the revolutionary achievements of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucrat capitalism, and guaranteed the victory and development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. These laws and regulations are all summaries of practical experience in the process of revolution and construction. The rightist elements do not like such laws; but the broad masses of the people are very satisfied. The people do not need those who call themselves "legal experts" to formulate laws. Past experience has told the people how cruel the old laws formulated by these people were to the people!
　　Indeed, up to now, some laws, such as the civil code, we have not yet formulated. We have adopted a cautious attitude towards legislative work. The rightist elements say that this is "creeping empiricism"! But in our opinion, this is a extremely valuable experience in legislation during the period of implementing the people's democratic dictatorship immediately after overthrowing the reactionary rule. We also know that it is not impossible to pick up a pen and compile a set of civil codes in a few days behind closed doors. But how should the most important part of the civil code, property rights, be stipulated? It was not until last year that we basically completed the socialist transformation and changed the ownership of the means of production. Before that, was it possible to formulate a set of socialist civil codes? Some people believe that law determines everything and that everything can be solved with a stroke of a pen. This is either out of naive fantasy or intentional lying and deception. The laws we should formulate are laws that adapt to the current economic base and political demands, are urgently needed by the people, and can solve practical problems, rather than laws that are equivalent to a mere scrap of paper. How can we act rashly? The reason why rightist elements criticize us for being slow in legislation is nothing more than wanting us to hastily formulate some laws that are unfavorable to the people but favorable to counter-revolutionaries, so as to tie the hands and feet of the people and facilitate counter-revolutionaries in carrying out "legal struggles." Facts tell us, and especially the actual experience in the rectification campaign fully proves, that counter-revolutionaries not only take up guns and bombs to oppose the people's regime, but also exploit loopholes in the law to carry out "legal struggles." If we do not adopt a cautious attitude in legislative work, we will be fooled.
　　The rightist elements criticize us for "emphasizing politics and not understanding the specialization of legal science." This statement is partly right and partly wrong. Saying that we "emphasize politics" is right. Marxists-Leninists have always believed that law serves politics. There is no law in the world that is above politics. Engels, in describing the laws and enforcement of the British bourgeoisie, said: "The purpose of all legislation is, first of all, to protect the propertied class from the propertyless..." "The hostility towards the proletariat is so deeply rooted in the foundation of the law that judges, especially the justices of the peace who themselves belong to the bourgeoisie and are in frequent contact with the proletariat, can comprehend this meaning of the law without thinking." Don't the rightist elements admire the old capitalist country of Britain, considering it a paradise of "democracy" and "rule of law"? But please see, is Britain's legislation and judicature detached from politics and violate the interests of the bourgeoisie? Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime once formulated many laws to suppress the revolution, didn't they have a political purpose? When the pseudo-judicial organs that enforced these laws, such as the Supreme Procuratorate of the Kuomintang government where Yang Zhaolong served as the chief prosecutor, handled cases of persecuting communists, didn't they serve reactionary politics?
　　We do not conceal that our laws are to protect the interests of the working people and are class-based. It is a form of political expression and a concretization of policies and guidelines. We must "emphasize politics" in formulating laws. Similarly, we must also "emphasize politics" in judicial work. Of course, once a law is enacted, it must be observed. But within the scope stipulated by the law, we must obey the requirements of politics. If the law itself can no longer adapt to the political requirements, then this law should be repealed or amended through legal procedures.
　　There is no contradiction between "emphasizing politics" and acknowledging the "specialization of legal science." It is wrong for the rightist elements to say that we "do not understand the specialization of legal science." The difference between us and them is not whether to acknowledge the specialization of legal science, but what is legal science. There are various legal theories in the world, all claiming to be scientific, but we believe that only Marxist-Leninist legal theory is the true scientific legal theory, and all others are non-scientific. The universal truths in Marxist-Leninist legal theory, such as the principle of the proletarian dictatorship, are not, as the rightist elements say, "unable to solve problems," but have truly solved the major problem of life and death for us. We should only enrich and develop Marxist-Leninist legal theory with new revolutionary experiences, and should not pick up the leftovers of idealistic legal theories to revise or even replace it. The rightist elements say that we "do not understand the specialization of legal science," but in reality, they want us to abandon Marxist-Leninist legal theory and acknowledge that bourgeois legal theory is a specialized science, that is, to restore the old laws formulated according to these theories and to interpret the laws according to these theories, just as they oppose our "emphasizing politics," in reality they oppose emphasizing revolutionary politics and allow them to secretly peddle counter-revolutionary politics. This is a trick they often play, and we must smash it.
　　The rightist elements not only want the restoration of reactionary old laws, but also the reinstatement of old judicial personnel. To this end, they not only attack our legal system, but also attack our judicial cadres, saying that the current judicial cadres are incompetent because they do not understand the law, cannot distinguish between crime and non-crime, have low cultural levels, and cannot write a decent judgment, etc. The reasons held by the rightist elements cannot withstand refutation. The rightist elements do not recognize our laws, so their so-called "not understanding the law" of course refers to not understanding the old laws. They regard the old laws as golden rules and want to restore the old laws. Of course, they require judges to not only "understand" but also "enforce" the old laws. But we have already announced the abolition of the old laws and do not allow them to be used as the basis for judgment, so why must judges understand them? Let's be honest! We fully understand the reactionary essence of the old laws. No matter how you support and promote them, we will resolutely not use them. The so-called "unclear distinction between crime and non-crime" seems like a good question. Of course, the boundary between crime and non-crime must be clearly drawn. In fact, we have drawn this boundary very clearly. But the rightist elements insist that it is not clear, because they use the reactionary old laws as the standard for drawing the boundary. Naturally, what we consider a crime, they consider not a crime. For example, on the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, we believe that eliminating counter-revolutionaries is entirely in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, while the rightist elements shout loudly: "The movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries is fundamentally illegal." The problem is that the rightist elements sympathize with counter-revolutionaries in their hearts and hate the people. They always want to defend counter-revolutionaries according to the old laws, so that those who should be sentenced are not sentenced, and those who should be severely punished are lightly punished, and they use every opportunity to demand "rehabilitation" and amnesty. Obviously, the difference between us and them is the irreconcilable difference between revolution and counter-revolution.
　　The rightist elements' so-called "low cultural level and inability to write a decent judgment" is essentially to exclude party cadres of worker and peasant origin, saying that workers and peasants are incompetent and that only intellectuals who have studied the old laws are competent. To criticize this view with Lenin's words, it is "absurd, rude, despicable, and filthy old prejudice, the filthy selfish idea of ​​the capitalist." They regard writing a so-called "decent judgment" as a remarkable thing. In fact, the so-called "decent judgment" is nothing more than empty and soulless bureaucratic jargon. We do not need such "decent judgments." What is the disadvantage of not being able to write them?
　　The rightist elements shouted that as a result of judicial reform, "the old judicial personnel were beaten to death with a stick," "sent to the garbage can," and "sent to the cold palace." Now is the time for them to "return to the team." The so-called "you can't do it, I'll do it!" "Party cadres should step down, and old judicial personnel should step up." They not only shouted, but also acted in a planned way. They collected information everywhere about the work transfers of old judicial personnel, inciting them to rise up and demand to return to the team. In Shanghai alone, they put forward the slogan of more than 400 judges and more than 1,000 lawyers returning to the team.
　　It is true that as a result of judicial reform, some old judicial personnel were purged from the judicial organs. This is in line with the requirements of the revolution and the interests of the people. Before the judicial reform, the real power of most judicial organs was still in the hands of the old judicial personnel. They still enforced the pseudo-Six Codes that had been abolished, still maintained the old judge's style of riding on the heads of the people, and many people continued the traditions of the reactionary era, and constantly committed crimes of corruption, torture, violation of laws and regulations, and even carried out counter-revolutionary activities. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, we carried out the judicial reform movement, criticized the old legal views, combated the old judge's style, transferred some old judicial personnel, and transferred in a group of revolutionary cadres who truly protected the interests of the people, so that the power of trial was in the hands of the people. At that time, our handling of the old judicial personnel was to adopt the policy of dealing with them differently according to different situations. Among them, some people, after criticism and self-criticism, their thinking was transformed, they were able to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and they were determined to abandon the old legal views and change the old judge's style, so they were still kept in the courts or judicial departments and bureaus to work. As for those who were originally progressive people, it goes without saying; some people were not suitable for judicial work, so they were transferred to do other appropriate work or sent to study; there were also a very small number of people who were counter-revolutionaries, corrupt elements, or other criminals, and of course they would encounter the fate of being purged, and serious cases were even subject to legal sanctions. This kind of handling not only satisfied the masses, but also some old judicial personnel who sincerely accepted transformation were not dissatisfied, believing that this was to treat the illness and save the person. However, the rightist elements took the opportunity of our rectification to launch a large-scale counterattack and carry out restoration attempts. Rightist elements! You have committed numerous crimes and should have been sanctioned by the people. The people have forgiven you, not only did not punish you, but also gave you preferential treatment, which can be said to be the best of humanity. What are you still shouting about "being beaten to death with a stick"?
　　In short, the direct purpose of the rampant attack by the rightist elements in the legal field is to seize the leadership of the legislative and judicial aspects, and then change our national system! And this is precisely a part of the entire offensive of the national rightist elements against the Party and against socialism. It is a step to attempt to overthrow the people's regime and restore reactionary rule. Therefore, we must strengthen the anti-rightist struggle in the legal field and completely smash their restoration attempts.

　　粉碎法学界右派分子的复辟企图
　　韩幽桐
    去年以来，上海、北京等地的法学界右派分子曾经挂着学术讨论的招牌，进行拥护旧法的活动。他们宣传着剥削阶级的法和社会主义的法之间存在着“继承性”。就是说后者必须继承前者，这是客观规律，违反了就会变成“干部无法可依，人民无法可守”的无政府状态！很明显，他们并不是真要进行什么学术讨论，而是玩弄一种政治阴谋。如果他们的主张获得胜利，那就可以进一步公然主张反动的旧法复辟，旧司法人员卷土重来，居高位，握大权，鱼肉人民，而为反革命分子服务。他们这种政治阴谋活动，实际上是他们在整风运动中全面进攻的前奏。
    果然大鸣大放的形势一来，他们认为是更好的进攻机会，于是，图穷匕首现，原形毕露，揭开“学者”面具，露出凶神恶相，发动了全面的猖狂进攻，得意忘形地认为这下子可以恢复旧法的作用，恢复旧司法人员的地位，夺取司法方面的领导权，使反动势力在司法方面复辟，以削弱并进而推翻人民民主专政了。
    右派分子进攻的矛头，首先，指向法制方面。他们诬蔑我们“无法”，异口同声地喊叫“无法可依，无法可守”，“没有法制，只有人治”。并大声疾呼“要建立法制”，企图把整风运动转变成反社会主义法制、使反动的旧法制复辟的运动。
    对于他们的反动企图、荒谬言论必须给以严厉反击。
    全国解放后，我们宣布废止了伪六法，陆续制定了有关各方面的许多法律和法规。这些法律和法规都是适应着我们过渡时期经济基础、政治要求而制定的。它巩固着反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的革命成果，保障着社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的胜利和发展。这些法律、法规都是革命和建设过程中的实践经验的总结。对于这样的法律，右派分子是很不喜欢的；但是广大人民却是很满意的。人民不需要那些自命为“法学专家”的人们制定法律。过去的经验告诉人民，经过这些人们制定的旧法律对人民来说是多么残酷！
    的确，到现在为止，有些法律，例如民法我们还没有制定。我们对于立法工作是采取着慎重态度的。右派分子说这是“爬行经验主义”！但在我们看来，这正是刚推翻反动统治，实行人民民主专政时期，立法上的极宝贵的经验。我们也知道如果是闭门造车地拿起笔来编写，在几天内搞出一套民法典并不是不可能。但是民法典的重要部分所有权怎样规定呢？直到去年，我们才基本上完成了社会主义改造，改变了生产资料所有制。在这以前，制定一套社会主义性质的民法典有可能吗？有人认为法律决定一切，只要大笔一挥，就可解决一切问题。这不是出于天真的幻想，就是有意说谎、骗人。我们应当制定的法律是适应当前经济基础和政治要求，为人民所迫切需要，能够解决实际问题的法律，而不是等于一纸空文的法律。这怎么能轻率从事呢？而右派分子所以还要批评我们立法迟缓，无非是要我们马马虎虎制定一些不利于人民而利于反革命分子的法律，束缚人民手脚，而便于反革命分子进行“合法斗争”。事实告诉我们，特别整风运动中的实际经验充分证明，反革命分子不仅拿起手枪炸弹反对人民政权，而且也钻法律的空隙，进行“合法斗争”。如果在立法工作上不采取慎重态度，就会上当。
    右派分子批评我们“强调政治，不懂法律科学的专门性”。这话有对，有不对。说我们“强调政治”对，马列主义者从来就认为法律是为政治服务的。世界上没有超政治的法律。恩格斯在叙述英国资产阶级的法律和执行情况时说过：“全部立法的目的，首先在于保护有产者以防范无产者……”。“对无产阶级的敌视态度是如此根深蒂固地成为法律的基础，以致法官们，尤其是本身属于资产阶级的，而又和无产阶级接触十分频繁的治安法官，不加思索就能理会到法律的这一层意义。”右派分子不是很崇拜老牌资本主义国家英国，认为它是“民主”“法治”的天国吗？但请看，英国的立法和司法，是不是脱离政治，违反资产阶级的利益呢？蒋介石反动政权曾经制定好些镇压革命的法律，难道没有政治目的吗？执行这些法律的伪司法机关，例如杨兆龙充当过检察长的国民党政府最高检察署，处理迫害共产党员的案件时，难道不是为反动政治服务吗？
    我们毫不隐讳，我们的法律是保护劳动人民的利益的，是具有阶级性的。它是政治的一种表现形式，是政策、方针的定型化。我们制定法律必须“强调政治”。同样，在司法工作中，也必须“强调政治”。当然法律一经制定，必须遵守。但在法律规定的范围内必须服从政治的要求。如果法律本身已不能适应政治要求，那么，这个法律就应当经过法定手续废止或修改。
    “强调政治”和承认“法律科学的专门性”，并没有矛盾。右派分子说我们“不懂法律科学的专门性”，不对。我们和他们的分歧不是承认不承认法律科学的专门性的问题，而是什么是法律科学的问题。世界上有各种法律学说，都自命为科学，但我们认为只有马列主义的法律学说才是真正的科学的法律学说，其它都是非科学的。马列主义法律学说中的普遍真理，例如无产阶级专政的原理，不是像右派分子所说“不能解决问题”，而是真正给我们解决了敌死我活的大问题。对于马列主义的法律学说，我们只应当用新的革命经验来丰富和发展它，而不应当摭拾唯心主义法律学说的唾余来修正甚至代替。右派分子说我们“不懂法律科学的专门性”，实际上是要我们放弃马列主义的法律学说，而承认资产阶级的法律学说是专门科学，也就是恢复根据这些学说制定的旧法，并根据这些学说来解释法律，正像他们反对我们“强调政治”，实际上是反对强调革命的政治，而让他们偷偷贩卖反革命的政治一样。这是他们惯玩的手法，我们必须粉碎它。
    右派分子不仅要反动的旧法复辟，而且要旧司法人员复位。为此，他们不仅攻击我们的法制，同时也攻击我们的司法干部，说现在的司法干部是不能胜任的，因为不懂法律，分不清犯罪和不犯罪的界限，文化低，写不出一个像样的判决等等。右派分子所持的理由是经不起驳斥的。右派分子既不承认我们的法律，那么，他们所谓“不懂法律”当然是指不懂旧法了。他们奉旧法为金科玉律，要使旧法复辟，当然要求审判员不仅要“懂得”，而且要“执行”旧法。但是我们早已宣布废止旧法，不准拿它作为审判的根据，审判员为什么必须懂得它呢？老实说吧！我们完全懂得旧法的反动本质。尽管你们怎样拥护、宣传，我们还是坚决不用。所谓“犯罪和不犯罪的界限不清”，好像很会提问题的样子。犯罪和不犯罪的界限当然必须划清。事实上，我们对这个界限是划得很清楚的。但右派分子硬说是不清楚，则是因为他们把反动的旧法做为划清界限的标准，自然我们认为是犯罪，他们就认为不是犯罪了。如在肃反问题上，我们认为肃反完全合乎宪法的规定，右派分子则大喊大叫：“肃反运动根本不合法。”问题是右派分子在内心上就同情反革命分子，而仇恨人民，他们总想根据旧法，替反革命分子辩护，使得该判不判，重罪轻判，并利用一切机会要求“平反”，要求大赦。很明显，我们和他们之间的分歧是不可调和的革命和反革命的分歧。
    右派分子所谓“文化低，写不出一个像样的判决”的本意，就是排斥工农出身的党员干部，说工农不行，只有学过旧法的知识分子才行。这种观念用列宁的话来批判，就是“荒谬、粗野、卑鄙、龌龊的旧成见，是资本家龌龊的私利观念。”他们把写出所谓“像样的判决”，当做一个了不起的事。其实，所谓“像样的判决”不外是空洞无物的判牍八股。我们不需要这样的“像样的判决”。写不出，又算什么缺点呢？
    右派分子喊叫司法改革的结果，“旧司法人员被一棍子打死了”，“被送进垃圾箱去了”，“被送进冷宫去了”，现在是“还魂归队”的时候了。所谓“你不行，我来干！”“党员干部应当下台，旧司法人员应当上台”。他们不仅喊叫，并且有计划地行动起来了。他们到处搜集旧司法人员工作调动的情况，煽动他们一涌而起，要求归队，只在上海一地，他们就提出四百多个推事，一千多个律师归队的口号。
    不错，司法改革的结果，有些旧司法人员被从司法机关清洗出去了。这是符合革命要求和人民利益的。司法改革以前，大部分司法机关实权仍掌握在旧司法人员的手里。他们仍执行着已被废除的伪六法，仍保持着骑在人民头上的旧法官的作风，还有不少的人沿袭着反动时代的传统，继续不断地发生贪污，刑讯，违法乱纪的罪行，甚至进行反革命活动。为了巩固人民民主专政，我们进行了司法改革运动，批判了旧法观点，打击了旧法官作风，调开了一些旧司法人员，调进了一批真正保护人民利益的革命干部，使审判权掌握在人民手里。当时，我们对旧司法人员的处理，是采取着根据不同的情况，区别对待的方针。在他们中间，有些人经过批评和自我批评，思想得到改造，能够划清敌我界限，决心放弃旧法观点，改变旧法官作风，就仍被留在法院或司法厅、局工作。至于原来就是进步人士的，更不待说；有些人不适于再做司法工作，就被调去做其他适当工作或送去学习；也有极少数人是反革命分子、贪污分子或其他犯罪分子，当然要遭遇到被清洗的命运，严重的并且受到了法律制裁。这样处理不仅群众满意，就是一些诚意接受改造的旧司法人员自己也没有什么不满意，认为这是治病救人。可是右派分子却趁着我们整风机会大举反攻，进行复辟企图。右派分子们！你们罪行累累，本应受到人民的制裁。人民宽恕了你们，不但没有治罪，反而给以优厚待遇，可以说是仁至义尽了，你们还喊叫什么“被一棍子打死”呢？
    总之，法学界右派分子猖狂进攻的直接目的，是夺取立法司法方面的领导权，进而改变我们的国家制度！而这也正是全国右派分子反党反社会主义整个攻势的一部分，是企图推翻人民政权，恢复反动统治的一个步骤。因此，我们必须加强法学界的反右派斗争，彻底粉碎他们的复辟企图。
