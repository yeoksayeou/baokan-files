The large number of facts revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle prove that a person becoming a Rightist is by no means, as some Rightists explain themselves, due to "accidental carelessness, falling into the water," but rather each has a different, either long or short, path of development. How Peng Zigang, the editor-in-chief of "Traveler" magazine, embarked on her Rightist road provides a good illustration.

According to materials revealed and provided by the recent Beijing press work symposium and people familiar with Peng Zigang: As early as twenty years ago, Peng Zigang, carrying the aspirations of intellectuals pursuing progress, walked out of the China University in Beiping. Through the connections of a progressive teacher from her middle school days, she went to "Women's Life" in Shanghai as an assistant editor. She began to come into contact with a large number of left-wing cultural figures, received the baptism of progressive thought, and participated in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement led by the Communist Party. In 1938, Peng Zigang joined the Chinese Communist Party in Hankou. Although Peng Zigang did not have a deep understanding of the Communist Party at the time, in her own words, joining the party was to "yearn for victory in the anti-Japanese war and a democratic life," Peng Zigang finally found the correct path and had every possibility of becoming a true proletarian fighter. However, Peng Zigang, an intellectual from an exploiting class, did not go down the correct path. She superficially and verbally pursued progress, but actually went in the opposite direction. She has always not paid attention to her own ideological transformation, stubbornly preserving the ideological essence of bourgeois individualism and liberalism. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, Peng Zigang worked as a reporter for the old "Ta Kung Pao". She entered the old Ta Kung Pao under the banner of a progressive reporter. Yang Gang of the People's Daily revealed at the press work symposium that Peng Zigang worked as a reporter for the old Ta Kung Pao entirely for her own reputation. She never cared about the progressive situation or the political stance of a Communist Party member. Peng Zigang was very successful in the old Ta Kung Pao. She put up her own banner, overwhelmed others, and attacked and excluded another progressive female reporter, wanting to be the only one dominant on the news front in Chongqing at that time. The old Ta Kung Pao, which superficially criticized the Kuomintang but greatly helped it, gave Peng Zigang fame, status, and a generous material life, gave her the convenience of an "uncrowned king" who could "enter and exit the doors of famous officials and wealthy people with pride," gave her the "freedom" to shout a few progressive slogans without worrying about being arrested by the Kuomintang, and finally, even gave Peng Zigang's husband, Xu Ying, huge amounts of stocks. Peng Zigang regarded the old Ta Kung Pao as her "reborn parents." Not long ago, she often promoted the "glorious tradition" of the old Ta Kung Pao, portraying the boss of the old Ta Kung Pao as a virtuous person who "entrusted reporters wholeheartedly," was "good at cultivating talents," and "opened up a free world," bragging about the "independent thinking" of the reporters of the old Ta Kung Pao, and boasting that she had written many "progressive news" articles in the old Ta Kung Pao. The press work symposium peeled off the mask of this "progressive reporter" from the news, communications, and features she wrote in the old Ta Kung Pao for thirteen years, proving that she was merely a news tool that was progressive in form, anti-Party in essence, and used by reactionary rulers to decorate their facade.

A black line runs through Peng Zigang's "keen eyes" and "divine pen." She not only spared no effort to distort the image of the people's leader Chairman Mao and progressive cultural figures, but even praised Chiang Kai-shek, John Leighton Stuart, Hu Shih and others. In the spring of 1946, when Chiang Kai-shek went to Beijing to deploy the civil war, Peng Zigang called Chiang Kai-shek "Blue Sky" (a traditional epithet for a just ruler), saying that the people in the north "breathed a sigh of relief" because of Chiang Kai-shek's arrival. Peng Zigang wrote Song Ailing, the wife of Kong Xiangxi, who was notorious for carrying foreign dogs by plane from Hong Kong after the outbreak of the Pacific War, as a kind "orphan nanny," and described the reactionary leader Chen Lifu as having great charm... but said that the female soldiers of the Eighth Route Army were disheveled and clumsy. What is even more intolerable is that under Peng Zigang's "divine pen," the famous international spy Kawashima Yoshiko actually became a charming, innocent girl, a person with "feelings." Even two years after Kawashima Yoshiko was arrested and imprisoned, Peng Zigang said that on the scales of her mind, she could not decide whether Kawashima Yoshiko was a spy, a war criminal, or even a cunning and intelligent woman. The press work symposium also analyzed and criticized Peng Zigang's so-called good articles exposing the dark life of the Kuomintang, pointing out that most of them were merely based on the identity of upper-class intellectuals, proceeding from the bourgeois "humanitarian" point of view, and giving some insignificant pity to the suffering poor.

When Peng Zigang was working and thinking in this way, the Party organization repeatedly helped her, pointing out the mainstream of the development of the situation and organizing her to study Marxism-Leninism. However, Peng Zigang called studying Marxism-Leninism "not entering the brain." She did not go to the Chongqing Office of the Communist Party for a long time, but was enthusiastic about entering the doors of "Party and state dignitaries." Because Peng Zigang insisted on a bourgeois position and was estranged from the Party for a long time, everyone was happy after the national liberation, but this Communist Party member was frowning. In her own self-examination, she said: "Suddenly the sky was bright, and I didn't know what to do for a while? The old ways disappeared, and I could no longer act alone." At this turning point, Peng Zigang did not catch up with the times, but turned right again and adopted a hostile attitude towards the new society. She slandered the new society for stifling her "sensitivity" and "independent thinking," and shouted all day long: "This restricts my freedom too much!" Peng Zigang continued to resist ideological transformation. She did not participate in several major ideological transformation movements, and she showed very little interest in daily political life. At political study discussion meetings, she could doze off. If she was not satisfied, she would leave without waiting for the discussion to end.

Peng Zigang was unwilling to live the Party's organizational life, and only wanted to be a Communist Party member in name only. She even contrasted the Party with independent thinking, saying that the Party hindered her independent thinking and regarded the Party as a burden. In early 1949, after the liberation of Tianjin, the central government decided to reorganize the "Ta Kung Pao" in Tianjin into "Progress Daily" and asked Peng Zigang to go to "Progress Daily" to participate in the Party group. However, Peng Zigang was unwilling to give up her "free life" in Beijing (at that time, the Beijing office of Ta Kung Pao had not yet established a Party organization) and the enjoyment of her family. She resolutely refused to go to Tianjin and even abandoned her Party organizational relationship. Later, the Party wanted to transfer her to "New Observer" magazine, but she did not go either. Peng Zigang had no Party organization in her mind at all. She did not obey the needs of revolutionary work. She wanted to find a job freely. She attacked and excluded Communist Party members in the "Traveler" magazine. In more than two years, two-thirds of the Party members in the editorial department were transferred out by her. She said that a newly added deputy editor was sent by the Party to monitor her.

When the press work symposium criticized Peng Zigang's right-wing words and deeds, the broad masses of journalists reflected that they had received a profound class ideological education. People pointed out that many bourgeois right-wing elements in society oppose previous political movements, saying that they hurt intellectuals, and some even say that it is possible to reach socialist society without the leadership of the Communist Party. From Peng Zigang's right-wing path of development, it is not difficult to see how urgent it is for an intellectual to seriously carry out ideological transformation and resolutely accept the leadership of the Communist Party.

### 彭子冈的右派道路

　　彭子冈的右派道路
　　新华社记者  宗子度
    反右派斗争中揭露出来的大量事实证明：一个人成为右派分子，绝不像某些右派分子自我辩解的那样，说由于“偶然不慎，失足落水”，而是各有不同的或长或短的发展道路的。“旅行家”杂志主编彭子冈怎样走上她的右派道路，就提供了一个很好的说明。
    据最近几天北京新闻工作座谈会和一些熟悉彭子冈的人所揭露和提供的材料：早在二十多年前，彭子冈带着知识分子追求进步的憧憬走出北平中国大学的校门，通过她的一位中学时期进步教员的关系，到上海“妇女生活”担任助编，开始接触了大批的左翼文化人，受到了进步思想的洗礼，并参加了共产党所领导的抗日救亡运动。1938年，彭子冈在汉口参加了中国共产党。尽管当时彭子冈对共产党还谈不上什么深刻的认识，用她自己的话来说，入党是为了“向往抗日胜利和民主生活”，彭子冈总算是找到了正确的道路，完全有可能成为一个真正的无产阶级战士。但是，彭子冈这个出身于剥削阶级的知识分子并没有往正确的道路上走，她表面上和口头上追求进步，实际上却向着相反的方向去。她一直不重视自己的思想改造，顽固地保存着资产阶级个人主义和自由主义的思想实质。抗日战争和人民解放战争时期，彭子冈都在旧“大公报”作记者。她是打着进步记者的旗号进入旧大公报的。人民日报杨刚在新闻工作座谈会上揭露说，彭子冈在旧大公报作记者，完全是为了她自己的名誉在工作。她从不关心进步的局势和作为一个共产党员的政治立场。彭子冈在旧大公报是很得势的，她打出自己的旗帜，压倒别人，打击和排斥另一个进步的女记者，想在当时重庆的新闻阵地上唯我独尊。对国民党小骂大帮忙的旧大公报，给了彭子冈以名誉、地位和优厚的物质生活，给了她“昂然出入于名公巨卿之门”的“无冕之王”的方便，给了她喊几声进步而不必担心会被国民党抓起来的“自由”，最后，还送给彭子冈的丈夫徐盈巨额的股票。彭子冈就把旧大公报当成了“再生父母”。不久以前，她还经常鼓吹旧大公报的“光荣传统”，把旧大公报的老板描绘成“放手信赖记者”、“善于培养人材”和“开拓自由天地”的贤人，吹嘘旧大公报记者的“独立思考”，炫耀她自己在旧大公报写了许多“进步的新闻”。新闻工作座谈会从彭子冈十三年来在旧大公报上所写的消息、通讯和特写中，剥开了这位“进步记者”的画皮，证明她只不过是形式上进步、骨子里反党、被反动统治者用来装璜门面的一个新闻工具而已。
    一条黑线贯穿着彭子冈的“慧眼”和“神笔”。她不但不惜歪曲人民领袖毛主席和进步文化人的形象，而且竟然歌颂蒋介石、司徒雷登、胡适之流。1946年春天，蒋介石到北京部署内战，彭子冈把蒋介石叫做“青天”，说北方的老百姓因为蒋介石的到来而“舒了一口气”。彭子冈把太平洋战争爆发后从香港用飞机载运洋狗因而臭名昭著的孔祥熙的老婆宋霭龄，写成是一位慈祥的“孤儿保姆”，把反动头子陈立夫描写得大有丰采……却说八路军的女战士是狼狈不堪，粗粗蠢蠢。更加不能令人容忍的是，在彭子冈的“神笔”之下，著名的国际间谍川岛芳子竟变成了一个妩媚的、天真烂漫的姑娘，是一个有“感情”的人。在川岛芳子被捕入狱已经两年之时，彭子冈还说在她心理的天秤上，还决定不下川岛芳子是间谍是战犯或竟是一个佻黠慧达的女性的法码。新闻工作座谈会还分析和批判了彭子冈所谓揭露国民党黑暗生活的好文章，指出其中大多数也不过是以上层知识分子的身份，从资产阶级的“人道主义”观点出发，对受苦受难的穷人施舍一些不关痛痒的怜悯而已。
    当彭子冈在这样工作和思想的时候，党组织曾多次帮助她，指出时局形势发展的主流，组织她学习马列主义。可是，彭子冈把学习马列主义称做“不入脑子”。她长时期不到中共重庆办事处去联系，却热衷于出入“党国要人”之门。由于彭子冈坚持资产阶级立场，长期与党貌合神离，以致全国解放后，大家都在欢天喜地，而这位共产党员却愁眉苦脸。在她自己所写的思想检查中曾这样说：“忽然天光大亮，一时不知如何才好？旧的一套消逝了，再也不能单枪匹马逞能了。”在这个大转变的关头，彭子冈不是急起直追，赶上时代的脚步，而是再一次向右转，对新社会采取敌视的态度。她诋毁新社会扼杀了她的“敏感”和“独立思考”，整天地嚷：“这太限制我自由了！”彭子冈继续抗拒思想改造，几次大的思想改造运动她都没有参加，对于日常的政治生活表现非常冷淡。政治学习讨论会上，她可以打瞌睡，一不如意，竟会不等讨论会结束就径自离去。
    彭子冈不愿过党的组织生活，只想当个挂名的共产党员。她甚至把党和独立思考对立起来，说党妨碍了她的独立思考，把党当成包袱。1949年初，天津解放后，中央决定改组天津的“大公报”为“进步日报”，叫彭子冈去“进步日报”参加党组。可是，彭子冈不愿丢掉她在北京的“自由生活”（当时大公报北京办事处还没有建立党组织）和家庭的享乐，她断然拒绝去天津，更不惜丢掉党的组织关系。后来党要调她到“新观察”杂志，她也不去。彭子冈的心目中根本没有党的组织，她不服从革命工作的需要，她要自由寻找职业。她在“旅行家”杂志社内打击排斥共产党员，两年多的时间，编辑部的党员就被她调出了三分之二。新增加的一位副主编，她说是党派来监视她的。
    新闻工作座谈会批判彭子冈的右派言行时，广大的新闻工作者都反映说受到一次深刻的阶级思想教育。人们指出，社会上的许多资产阶级右派分子反对历次政治运动，说是伤害了知识分子，有的还说，不要共产党的领导，也可以走到社会主义社会。从彭子冈发展的右派道路，不难看出一个知识分子认真进行思想改造，坚决接受共产党的领导，是多么刻不容缓的大事情。
