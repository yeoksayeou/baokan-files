Socialist Education Improves Three Types of Cooperatives

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the large-scale launch of the socialist education movement, the face of backward cooperatives in Hunan Province has changed. According to information from twenty-three counties, of the original two thousand one hundred and seventy-eight third-category cooperatives, one thousand four hundred and fifty-five cooperatives (approximately 67% of the total number of third-category cooperatives) have improved to varying degrees through this movement.

    During this period, local Party committees took a series of measures to strengthen leadership over the third-category cooperatives. For example, the Lianyuan County Party Committee specifically studied measures to consolidate and improve the third-category cooperatives, organized core groups to lead the third-category cooperatives, and held four special meetings for cadres of the third-category cooperatives to exchange experiences in consolidating the third-category cooperatives. During this movement, the County Party Committee also dispatched more than two hundred additional cadres to strengthen the leadership of the third-category cooperatives, enabling the third-category cooperatives to be consolidated and improved. Before the movement, there were one hundred and seventy third-category cooperatives in the county. Now, twenty-seven have been upgraded to first-category, one hundred and six have been upgraded to second-category, and the problems of thirty-seven cooperatives have also been initially clarified. In the third-category cooperatives that have been rectified, poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants have received profound ideological education, which has strengthened this basic force, established a leading advantage, and improved the leadership core of the cooperatives, showing a thriving scene in all aspects. Li Guihua, Director of the Poor Peasants' Management Committee, said: "Now the agricultural cooperatives are truly led by us. We will do our best to run the agricultural cooperatives well." After the Huangjin Cooperative in Yuqing Township, Leiyang County, reversed its backward situation, it set off a production upsurge. The cooperative members are now carrying out emergency harvesting and planting to make up for the losses caused by the drought. In the past, cooperative members grew their own mung beans and ramie, but now they automatically hand them over to the cooperative and are willing to have them managed and distributed uniformly; the dispersed land has also been concentrated in the cooperative for unified management.

    社会主义教育提高了三类社
    本报讯　大规模开展社会主义教育运动以来，湖南省后进社的面貌已经有所改观。据二十三个县的了解，原有三类社二千一百七十八个，经过这次运动，已有一千四百五十五个社（约占三类型社总数67％）有了不同程度的提高。
    这段期间，各地党委采取了一系列的措施加强了对三类社的领导。如涟源县委具体研究了巩固提高三类社的措施，并且组织了领导三类社的核心小组，召开过四次三类社办社干部的专门会议，交流巩固三类社的经验。这次运动中，县委还加派了二百多名干部加强三类社的领导，使三类社得到了巩固提高。运动前，全县有一百七十个三类社，现在提高为一类的二十七个，提高为二类的一百零六个，还有三十七个社也初步摸清了问题。整顿过的三类社，贫农和新、老下中农受到了深刻的思想教育，使这个基本队伍坚强起来了，树立了领导优势，健全了社的领导核心，在各方面都出现了欣欣向荣的景象。贫农管委李桂华说：“现在农业社真的是我们来领导了，我们干到死也要把农业社办好。”耒阳县余庆乡黄金社扭转后进局面后，掀起了生产高潮，社员们正开展抢收、抢种以弥补旱灾损失。过去社员各种各的绿豆、苎麻，现在都自动地交给社里，愿意统一经营、统一分配；被分散了的土地也集中到社里统一经营了。
