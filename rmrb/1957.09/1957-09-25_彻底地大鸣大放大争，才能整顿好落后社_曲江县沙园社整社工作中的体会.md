Thoroughly Unleashing and Debating is the Only Way to Rectify Backward Cooperatives
    – Experiences from the Rectification Work of the Shayuan Cooperative in Qujiang County
    Lin Mingxun, First Secretary of the Shaoguan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The Shayuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lishi Township, Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, was a Category III cooperative (backward cooperative). From August 14th to September 6th, this cooperative fully implemented the policy of unleashing and debating, launching a great debate on socialist and capitalist ideologies among all its members. As a result of the debate, capitalist ideology has collapsed, and socialist ideology has gained an overwhelming advantage. The preliminary experience of Shayuan Cooperative's rectification work shows that the cooperative can be thoroughly rectified only by resolutely implementing the policy of unleashing and debating, carrying out arduous and in-depth socialist propaganda and education movements, and implementing the spirit of rectifying while correcting. This is especially true in Category III cooperatives that have been severely corroded and damaged by capitalist ideology.

    I. Capitalist Ideology Plays a Serious Destructive Role Within the Cooperative

To what extent has capitalist ideology eroded and damaged the Shayuan Cooperative? First of all, the private economy of the members has developed inappropriately and has become the main position. This can be seen very clearly from the comparison of the income of the members: last year, the total dividend of the cooperative was more than 24,000 yuan, while the private economic income of the members was more than 46,000 yuan; this year, the total dividend of the summer harvest was more than 19,000 yuan, while the private economic income of the members was more than 36,000 yuan. In terms of the number of households, 70% of the 219 households in the cooperative had more than 50% of their total income from private economic income last year; it is estimated that 65% of the households will have more than 50% of their total income from private economic income in the first half of this year, of which 46 rich middle peasant households almost all rely on private economic income, and the private economic income of some even accounts for 90% of their total income. The reasons for this serious situation are: the private land of the members has increased inappropriately, and the private sideline businesses of the members have also expanded inappropriately; the members spend less time working for the cooperative and more time engaging in private production and commercial speculation.

Another prominent manifestation is that the collective economy of the cooperative has been shaken and weakened, resulting in serious losses in the collective production of the cooperative. Because the members "care only about the private and not the public," the agricultural and sideline production of the cooperative last year was very poor.

The third prominent manifestation is that the socialist consciousness of the members has been reduced. Excluding landlords and rich peasants, it is estimated that 20% of the member households in the cooperative do not want to take the road of collectivization. Of the 46 rich middle peasant households, 80% belong to this category. Another category is that although they basically want to take the socialist road, they have varying degrees of capitalist ideology and behavior, and are dissatisfied with collectivization. These members account for half of the total number of households. Only 30% of the members are determined to take the socialist road, mainly the activists among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Among the six party members, three have capitalist ideology and behavior, and one-third of the 24 cadres above the team leader level have capitalist ideology and behavior.

There are not many people in Shayuan Cooperative who want to withdraw from the cooperative; even at the most serious time, there were only more than 30 households. Because since they can develop capitalist spontaneous forces within the cooperative and get many benefits, they do not need to withdraw from the cooperative.

    II. Backward Cooperatives Need Unleashing and Debating Even More

In the serious situation where capitalist ideology is so rampant in Shayuan Cooperative, can the policy of unleashing, debating, and contending solve the problem? Facts have proved that the more serious the capitalist ideology and behavior are in a cooperative, the more it needs unleashing and debating, and the more thorough the unleashing and debating, the better the cooperative can be rectified. The specific practices of Shayuan Cooperative are: (1) First of all, it is necessary to solve the problem of whether or not to unleash. The main concerns of party members and cadres are: First, they are afraid of chaos, thinking that "it is easy to unleash but difficult to rein in"; some said: "The foundation of the cooperative is not good, and it will collapse once it is unleashed." Second, they are afraid of not distinguishing right from wrong and wrongly accusing cadres. Third, they are afraid of not being able to compete with others. "Rich middle peasants can speak and calculate," and they are worried that there will be many people who engage in private production, and they are afraid that everyone will not speak fairly. The way to solve these ideological problems is, first of all, to explain to them the purpose and requirements of unleashing and debating, point out the fundamental reasons why the cooperative is not well-run, and explain that we must trust the majority of the masses and will never cause trouble. At the same time, it is also necessary to explain that if you do not "unleash," the masses will "unleash" themselves, and if you do not lead the "unleashing," there will be trouble. Make them understand that through unleashing and debating, they can both accept correct opinions to improve their work and criticize wrong opinions. Secondly, it is necessary to organize basic class teams, prepare materials, and carry out reasoned struggle. In this way, 90% of the party and league members and cadres of Shayuan Cooperative were mobilized to lead the movement. The director of the cooperative and other cooperative cadres openly and proactively reviewed the shortcomings in their work at meetings of all sizes, expressing their welcome to everyone's criticism, thus promoting unleashing and not causing any trouble.

    (2) Can backward cooperatives be unleashed? This is also a problem that must be solved. At the beginning of the unleashing and debating, the members were indeed worried. The general members had two main ideological situations: One was that they were afraid of being struggled against and being labeled as rightists. Some said: "I'm not afraid of taking the wrong road, but I'm most afraid of saying the wrong thing." The other was that they were not confident in unleashing, fearing that raising opinions would not be resolved and would be a waste of time. Some of the rich middle peasants with serious spontaneous forces were afraid that the masses would expose their "background." In response to these ideological situations, Shayuan Cooperative adopted the following measures: First, explain that the nature of unleashing is internal contradictions among the people, not contradictions between ourselves and the enemy; Second, explain the policies, adopt the method of reasoned debate to distinguish right from wrong, do not treat people with a rough attitude, and do not insult their personality; Third, cadres express their attitude that they will not strike back or retaliate, accept correct opinions, and rectify while unleashing; Fourth, hold meetings of different types separately and mobilize separately. Several meetings of rich middle peasants were also held specifically. As a result, not only could they be unleashed, but they were unleashed very well. 95% of the members raised opinions, and generally raised them quite thoroughly.

    (3) After unleashing, will evil spirits rise and increase the ideological confusion of the masses? According to the experience of Shayuan Cooperative, unleashing will not increase the ideological confusion of the masses. Because: First, most of the opinions raised by the members are correct; Second, most of the masses have the ability to distinguish various opinions. Shayuan Cooperative adopted the method of posting the opinions raised by the masses one by one. As long as there are wrong opinions, the masses will prepare to criticize them as soon as they see them; although there are also a few rich middle peasants who gloat over the fact that some people have raised some opinions attacking collectivization, and there are also a few poor and lower-middle peasants with lower awareness who were once pessimistic and disappointed, these are temporary phenomena. Once the debate is launched, the truth will come out.

    III. It is Necessary to Distinguish Between Major Rights and Wrongs

The focus of the great debate in Shayuan Cooperative is very prominent. The vast majority of members are very eager to "clarify the issue of collectivization." Putting together the opinions raised by the members on collectivization, the fundamental difference in collectivization is mainly these two issues: one is whether or not to collectivize; the other is what kind of cooperative should be established.

It is a recognized fact that the cooperative is not well-run; but why is the cooperative not well-run? There are fundamental differences in the views. The first great debate focused on the topic "What is the fundamental reason why the cooperative is not well-run?" Those who take the capitalist road attempt to use this to attack collectivization. In summary, they put forward that the "reasons" why the cooperative is not well-run are: First, the collectivization system is not good. "Advanced cooperatives are not as good as elementary cooperatives, elementary cooperatives are not as good as mutual aid groups, and mutual aid groups are not as good as individual farming." Second, the leadership of the cooperative is not good, and the cadres have no ability; Third, the production of the cooperative is not good, and each labor day is worth only 29 cents, which is too little. The masses put forward the facts and revealed that the fundamental reason why the cooperative is not well-run is that many people "care only about the private and not the public," take the capitalist road, and other reasons are false or secondary. Poor peasant Cheng Shoufu said: "It is not that collectivization is not good, but that some people's hearts are not good, eating the cooperative's food and engaging in private work." Poor peasant Cheng Laifu said: "Cadres have shortcomings that need to be corrected, but you are even worse, not working for the cooperative and specializing in private sideline businesses." "Why was the labor day worth only 29 cents last year?" The conclusion is that "the more private production is done, the less the cooperative earns," which is also caused by spontaneous forces. The masses also exposed a large number of facts about the three rich middle peasant households that were most serious in engaging in spontaneous forces to specifically illustrate the real reason why the cooperative was not well-run. People with serious capitalist ideology were then at a loss for words, and 18 of them made reviews at the meeting, admitting that engaging in spontaneous forces was wrong and guaranteeing to correct it. The cooperative cadres immediately expressed their welcome to their correction.

The second great debate focused on the topic "How should the cooperative be run in the future?" Which road should Shayuan Cooperative take in the future? The three roads found in the debate are: The first road is to withdraw from the cooperative and farm individually, dissolve the cooperative, and take the capitalist road. This is the opinion of a small number of rich middle peasants. It was immediately criticized and opposed by the vast majority of members. The second road is the road of "maintaining the status quo." This opinion represents the thinking of people with more private income. After analysis, it is still the capitalist road and cannot be taken. Then the third road came up, which is to thoroughly run the cooperative well, resolutely defeat capitalism, and take the socialist road. It requires "those who have taken the wrong road to turn back," and those who are determined to withdraw from the cooperative can also be allowed to do so voluntarily. At this time, some people who originally insisted on dissolving the cooperative or wanted to maintain the status quo also made reviews and asked to stay in the cooperative.

In order to further consolidate the socialist position and ensure that the socialist direction will never change in the future, a third debate was launched. The central content is how to guarantee the socialist road with actions and limit capitalist spontaneous forces. The cooperative cadres put forward eight questions and gave them to the masses for debate, namely: (1) On the basis of developing the agricultural and sideline production of the cooperative, it is necessary to realize that the collective economy of the cooperative is the main thing and the private economy of the members is the auxiliary thing; (2) Guarantee the completion of the state production plan; (3) Guarantee that members spend most of their time working for the cooperative; (4) The number of private plots and reclaimed land of members must be limited to a certain extent; (5) There should be an appropriate division of labor between the sideline business cooperatives, teams, and members; (6) It is necessary to prohibit commercial speculation; (7) Guarantee the completion of the state public grain task (the cooperative is a unified sales cooperative and has no grain purchase task) and the purchase task of agricultural products; (8) Establish a fertilizer purchase system. After discussion, specific measures were also formulated and passed by the members' congress for implementation. This is the decisive struggle to break through the capitalist fortress. The debate was extremely fierce. After these eight regulations were put forward, more than 40 people successively expressed disagreement or partial disagreement; after repeated debate, there were still four people who disagreed in the end, but they had verbally admitted that these eight regulations were reasonable.

As a result of the great debate in Shayuan Cooperative, the socialist awareness of the vast majority of members has been greatly improved. Except for three households that are still not convinced, the other 40 households that had taken the capitalist road have expressed that they will unite with the poor peasants to run the cooperative well and no longer take the capitalist road.

    IV. It is Necessary to Resolutely Improve Work

In addition to the most serious problem of being attacked by capitalist ideology, Shayuan Cooperative cannot deny that the reason why the cooperative is not well-run is also due to serious shortcomings in its work. The most prominent contradiction in the internal relations of the cooperative is that the production of the cooperative has not been well-run, which affects the increase of income of the members. Therefore, it is very important to closely combine the shortcomings of improving work in the great unleashing and debate.

On the issue of "rectifying while correcting," in addition to the eight measures to limit capitalist spontaneous forces that have been formulated and are being implemented, Shayuan Cooperative also emphasized solving the problems that the vast majority of members urgently demand to be solved during the rectification, such as the fact that two-thirds of the late rice fields raised by the members in the unleashing had no fertilizer; the fact that the cooperative did not pay the members for the fertilizer it purchased from them last year to this year, which affected the enthusiasm of the members to accumulate fertilizer; and the fact that the purchase of peanuts and red melon seeds was not calculated on a piecework basis. These problems were solved one after another during the rectification, which boosted the confidence of the members in running the cooperative well. The attendance rate of the members increased from 40% to 95%, which effectively promoted the great unleashing, debating, and contending.

    彻底地大鸣大放大争，才能整顿好落后社
    ——曲江县沙园社整社工作中的体会
    中共韶关地委第一书记　林名勋
    广东省曲江县犁市乡沙园农业生产合作社是一个三类社（落后社）。这个社从8月14日到9月6日这一期间，全面执行了大鸣大放大争的方针，在全体社员中展开了社会主义思想和资本主义思想的大辩论。辩论的结果，资本主义思想已经崩溃，社会主义思想取得了压倒优势。沙园社的整社工作的初步经验说明：必须坚决地执行大鸣大放大争的方针，艰苦深入地开展社会主义宣传教育运动，同时又贯彻边整边改的精神，合作社才能够彻底整顿得好。在严重地受资本主义思想腐蚀破坏的三类社中，更应坚决地这样做。
    一、资本主义思想在社内起着严重的破坏作用
    沙园社受资本主义思想的侵蚀和破坏到了怎样严重的程度呢？首先是社员私人经济不相适应地发展到占了主要的位置。从社员的收入情况对比便看得非常清楚：去年全社分红为二万四千多元，而社员私人经济收入却有四万六千多元；今年夏收分配全社分红一万九千多元，而社员私人经济收入却有三万六千多元，私人收入均多于社的分红。再按社员户计算，全社二百一十九户中去年全年社员私人经济收入超过其总收入50％以上的占70％的户；今年上半年估计亦有65％的户，其中四十六户富裕中农，则几乎全部都是以私人经济收入为主，私人经济收入多的竟占其总收入的90％。造成这个严重情况的原因是：社员私人土地不适当的增加了，社员私人的副业也是不适当的扩大了；社员为社出勤时间少，干私人生产及从事商业投机的多了。
    另一个突出的表现，就是社的集体经济受到动摇和削弱，使得社的集体生产受到严重的损失。由于社员“顾私不顾公”，所以去年社的农副业生产都搞得很坏。
    第三个突出的表现，就是社员的社会主义觉悟降低了。除去地主、富农，全社估计，不愿走合作化道路的社员户占20％。四十六户富裕中农中，80％属于这一类。另外一类是虽然基本愿意走社会主义道路，但本身存在程度不同的资本主义思想和行为，对合作化有所不满，这样的社员占总户数的一半。只有30％的社员是坚决走社会主义道路的，主要是贫农和下中农中的积极分子。党员六人中有三人有资本主义思想和行为，队长以上的二十四个干部中，有三分之一有资本主义思想和行为。
    沙园社闹退社的人是不多的；最严重的时候也不过三十多户。因为既然在社内可以发展资本主义自发势力，又可得到许多便宜，就不需要退社了。
    二、落后社更加需要大鸣大放大争
    沙园社在资本主义思想这样泛滥成潮的严重情况下，实行大放、大鸣、大争的方针能不能解决问题呢？事实证明，资本主义思想和行为越严重的社，就越需要大鸣大放大争，而且鸣放和争得越透彻，就越能够把社整顿好。沙园社具体的做法是：（1）首先要解决能不能够鸣放的问题。党员干部的顾虑主要是：第一，怕乱。认为“易放难收”；有的说：“社的基础不好，一放就会垮台”。第二，怕不分是非，冤枉干部。第三，怕争不过人家。“富裕中农能说会算”，耽心搞私人生产为主的人多，怕大家不讲公道话。解决这些思想问题的办法，首先主要是要向他们说清大鸣大放大争的目的和要求，指出社办不好的根本原因，说明要相信群众的大多数，决不会出乱子。同时又要说明，你不“放”，群众自己要“放”，不去领导“放”，那才会出乱子。使懂得通过大鸣大放大争，既能够接受正确意见来改进工作；又要对错误意见进行批驳。其次是要组织起基本的阶级队伍，准备材料，进行说理斗争。这样，沙园社90％的党、团员和干部都调动起来，领导运动，社主任及其他社干部都公开在大会、小会上主动检讨工作中的缺点，表示欢迎大家的批评，因而推动了鸣放，并且没有出现什么乱子。
    （2）在落后社能否放得起来呢？这也是必须加以解决的问题。在大鸣大放大争开始时，社员的确是有顾虑的，一般社员主要有两种思想情况：一是怕捱斗争、怕戴右派分子帽子，有的说：“不怕走错路，最怕说错话。”一是对鸣放信心不强，怕提了意见也得不到解决等于白说。而一部分自发势力严重的富裕中农，则是怕群众起来揭穿他们的“底子”。针对这些思想情况，沙园社采取了如下几条的做法：第一，说明鸣放性质是人民内部矛盾，不是敌我矛盾；第二，交代政策，采取说理辩论的方式来分清是非，不得以粗暴态度对待，不得侮辱人格；第三，干部表明态度，不打击不报复，接受正确意见，边放边改；第四，分别类型召开会议，分头发动。并专门开了几次富裕中农会议。结果不仅能够放得起来，而且放得很好，有95％的社员都提了意见，而且一般提得相当彻底。
    （3）大鸣大放之后，会不会邪气上升，增加群众思想的混乱呢？根据沙园社的经验证明，鸣放之后也不会增加群众的思想混乱。因为：第一，社员所提意见，大多数都是正确的；第二，对各种意见，大多数群众是有辨别能力的，沙园社把群众所提的意见采取逐条张榜公布的办法，只要有错误意见，群众一看到便准备批驳；虽然也有少数的富裕中农看到有人提出一些攻击合作化的意见而幸灾乐祸，也有少数觉悟较低的贫农、下中农，曾经一度悲观失望，但这都是暂时的现象，一经展开辩论，真理就会出来的。
    三、必须分清大是大非
    沙园社进行大辩论，中心是非常突出的。广大社员都十分迫切地要求“一定要把合作化的问题搞清楚”。把社员对合作化所提出的意见集中起来，在合作化问题上的根本分歧，主要是这两个问题：一个是要不要合作化的问题；一个是要怎样性质的合作社问题。
    合作社没有办好，这是社员公认的事实；但是合作社为什么没有办好呢？在看法上有根本的分歧。第一场的大辩论，就以“合作社办不好的根本原因在那里？”为中心题目。走资本主义道路的人企图借此来向合作化攻击，综合起来，他们提出了社办不好的“原因”是：第一，合作化制度不好，“高级社不如初级社，初级社不如互助组，互助组不如单干。”第二，社的领导不好，干部没有能力；第三，社的生产不好，每个劳动日值二角九分太少。群众摆出事实，揭露出办社不好的根本原因就是许多人“顾私不顾公”，走资本主义道路，其他原因都是假的或者是次要的。贫农成寿福说：“不是合作化不好，就是有人心不好，吃社里的粮，搞私人的工夫。”贫农成来福说：“干部有缺点要改，但是你们更不好，不出社的工，专搞私人副业。”“去年劳动日值为什么只有二角九分呢？”结论是“私人生产搞得多，社就收入少”，也是自发势力所造成。群众还揭发了搞自发势力最严重的三户富裕中农的大量事实，来具体说明社搞不好的真正原因。资本主义思想严重的人于是理屈词穷了，他们中便有十八个人在会议上作了检讨，承认搞自发势力不对，保证改正。社干部当即表示欢迎他们的改正。
    第二场的大辩论，是以“合作社今后应该如何办”为中心题目。沙园社今后走哪条路？在辩论中找出来的是这三条路：第一条是退社单干，解散合作社，走资本主义道路。这是少数富裕中农的意见。立即受到广大社员批驳和反对。第二条是“维持现状”的路，这个意见代表了私人收入较多的人的思想。经过分析实际还是资本主义的路，也走不得。跟着提出第三条路来了，就是要把社彻底办好，要坚决打垮资本主义，走社会主义的路。要求“走错了路的就回头”，至于坚决要退社的也可以任凭自愿。这时候，一些原来坚持要解散社或想保持现状的人，又作了检讨，要求留在社内。
    为了进一步巩固社会主义阵地，以保证社会主义方向今后永远不变，又开展第三场的辩论。中心内容是如何以行动来保证走社会主义道路，限制资本主义自发势力。社干部提出了八个问题，交给群众辩论，即：（1）在发展社的农副业生产的基础上，要实现以社的集体经济为主，社员私人经济为辅；（2）保证完成国家生产计划；（3）保证社员大多数时间为社出勤；（4）社员的自留地和开荒地数量要有一定的限制；（5）副业经营社、队、社员之间要有适当分工；（6）要禁止进行商业投机活动；（7）保证完成国家公粮任务（该社是统销社无购粮任务）及农产品收购任务；（8）建立收购肥料制度。经过讨论，还订出了具体的措施，在社员大会通过执行。这是攻破资本主义堡垒的决定性的一场斗争，辩论异常激烈，这八条规定提出来后，先后表示不同意及部分不同意的有四十多人；经过反复争论，最后仍剩下四人不同意，但在口头上已承认这八条规定是合理的。
    沙园社进行大辩论的结果，广大社员社会主义觉悟程度大大提高，原来四十多户已走上资本主义道路的人，除了有三户人家还不服之外，其他都表示和贫农团结一起，搞好合作社，不再走资本主义道路了。
    四、必须坚决改进工作
    沙园社除了受到资本主义思想进攻是一个最为严重的问题之外，不能否认，合作社所以办得不好，还有工作上的严重缺点。在社内关系上最突出的矛盾，就是社的生产没有搞好，影响社员增加收入，所以在大鸣大放大争之中，紧密地结合改进工作缺点，就显得非常重要。
    在“边整边改”的问题上，沙园社除了已经订出限制资本主义自发势力的八项措施正在贯彻执行外，同时十分强调在整社中解决广大社员迫切要求解决的问题，如在鸣放中社员提出的晚造水稻中间有三分之二的田没有下肥；去年到今年社收购社员的肥不给钱，影响社员积肥的积极性；以及在收购花生、红瓜子中没有按件计工等等问题，都在整社中先后解决了，从而鼓舞起社员办好社的信心，社员出勤率由40％增加到95％，从而有力地推动了大放大鸣大争。
