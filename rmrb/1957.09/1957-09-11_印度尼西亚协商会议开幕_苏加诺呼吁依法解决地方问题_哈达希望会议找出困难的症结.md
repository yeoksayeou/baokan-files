Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 10th: The Indonesian National Consultative Conference opened at nine o'clock this morning at the Independence Proclamation Building in Jakarta.

　　Conference Chairman, Prime Minister Djuanda, announced that the conference will discuss and resolve the abnormal relationship between the central government and local areas, the divisions and disunity within the military, and the independent financial and economic measures taken by various regions.

　　Djuanda specifically mentioned that President Sukarno and former Vice President Hatta both attended the meeting. He hoped that these two leaders with differing political views would participate in resolving the issue of restoring the integrity of the armed forces.

　　President Sukarno first spoke in his capacity as head of state, and then participated in the consultative conference as an advisor. Sukarno said that the various grievances and demands of the localities should be resolved through national legal channels, and should not be resolved by the various methods adopted in recent events. He called on everyone to return to legal channels.

　　Sukarno said that consultation should abide by the spirit of the Declaration of Independence and should respect the three conditions of a central government of an independent country, namely its own army, currency, and foreign relations.

　　Hatta also spoke at the meeting. He believed that the various difficulties encountered by Indonesia were due to "psychological conflicts." He said that there were also "conflicts" between the central government and several localities, and that the consultative conference should identify the root causes of these difficulties and find solutions. He hoped the conference would not fail.

　　In the venue, Sukarno and Hatta sat on either side of Djuanda, with the chiefs of staff of the three armed services and government officials sitting behind them. Local representatives and advisors sat on both sides in front.

    据新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚全国协商会议今天上午九时在雅加达的独立宣言大厦开幕。
    会议主席朱安达总理宣布，会议将协商解决中央和地方的不正常的关系问题、军队内部的分裂和不统一的问题以及各地在财经措施上的各自为政问题。
    朱安达特别提到苏加诺总统和哈达前副总统都出席了会议。他希望这两位政见不同的领袖参加解决恢复武装部队的完整问题。
    苏加诺总统首先以国家元首的身份讲话，随后以顾问的身份参加协商会议。苏加诺说，地方上的各种不满情绪和要求，应该通过国家的法律途径去解决，不应该用最近发生的事件所采取的各种方式去解决。他呼吁大家回到法律途径上来。
    苏加诺说，协商应该遵守独立宣言的精神，应该尊重作为一个独立国家的中央政府的三个条件，即自己的军队、货币和对外关系。
    哈达也在会上讲话。他认为印度尼西亚碰到的各种困难是由于“心理冲突”。他说，中央和几个地方也存在着“冲突”，协商会议应找出这些困难的症结，并且寻找解决办法。他希望会议不要失败。
    在会场里，苏加诺和哈达分坐在朱安达的两旁，他们的后面坐着三军参谋长和政府负责人。前面两旁坐着各地方代表和顾问。
