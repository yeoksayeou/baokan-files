　　Lin Zexu Museum Collects Relics
    In the "Lin Zexu Park," located five li outside Humen Township in Guangdong, a new "Zexu Museum" has been built and is currently collecting relics of the Opium War and Lin Zexu. Everything from the weapons, flags, clothing, and various instruments, documents, archives, and inscriptions used by Lin Zexu in his time are being collected. Several old cannons of various sizes, originally deployed along the coast of Humen at various forts and strategic passes, have already been collected, as well as some knives, swords, and other weapons used at the time, and various smoking paraphernalia. These relics and historical sites bear the marks of history and are very precious. The museum will open soon.

　　林则徐博物馆搜集遗物
    在广东虎门乡五里外的“林则徐公园”中，新建了一座“则徐博物馆”，正在分头征集鸦片战争及林则徐的遗物。举凡林则徐当年所用的武器、旗帜、服饰及各种器具、文件、档案、碑文都在征集之列。现在已搜集到几尊当年在虎门沿岸布设于各炮台、要隘间的大小古炮，以及一些当时所用的刀、剑等武器和各种烧烟的用具。这些遗物古迹斑斑，很是珍贵。该馆将于近期内开放。
