Your Excellency the Vice President,
Your Excellency the Ambassador, Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen:

　　Today, as His Excellency Dr. Radhakrishnan, Vice President of India, visits our country, the Indian Exhibition is opening in our capital. We are very pleased about this and express our warm welcome and sincere congratulations.

　　China and India have always been friendly and close neighbors.  In recent years, the friendly relations between our two countries have further developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.  Economic and cultural exchanges between the two peoples have also become closer.  In recent years, the trade volume between our two countries has increased significantly, the variety of exchanged goods has continued to increase, and there has been great progress in technical exchanges and cooperation, such as the mutual dispatch of professional delegations for visits, the mutual dispatch of interns, and the exchange of seeds and technical data.

　　India is a country with vast land and abundant resources, and a long history of culture.  After gaining political independence, the Indian people are eager to develop their economy.  At present, the Indian people are engaged in the cause of building their great motherland, and have already achieved many significant successes.  We believe that in the future, with the progress of the construction endeavors of China and India, the economic and cultural relations between the two countries will be further developed.

　　The first exhibition held by India in our country is a rich and colorful one.  Through the various industrial products, famous textiles, and exquisite handicrafts displayed at the exhibition, the Chinese people will see more profoundly the results of the creative labor of the Indian people.  At the same time, it also provides us with a good opportunity to learn everything useful from you.  In this way, Sino-Indian friendship can be continuously enriched and developed with the passage of time.  We believe that this exhibition will further promote economic and cultural exchanges between China and India, and will help the friendship and cooperation between our two countries' one billion peace-loving people.

　　We wish the Indian Exhibition great success!

　　Long live Sino-Indian friendship!

　　南汉宸的讲话
　　尊敬的副总统阁下，
　　大使阁下同志们、女士们和先生们：
    今天，正当印度副总统拉达克里希南博士阁下来我国访问的时候，印度展览会在我国首都开幕了。我们对此感到非常高兴，并表示热烈的欢迎和诚挚的祝贺。
    中印两国一向是和睦亲密的近邻。近年来，我们两国间的友好关系在和平共处五项原则的基础上有了更进一步的发展。两国人民在经济和文化上的交流也更加密切。近几年来，我们两国间的贸易额有了显著的增加，交换货物的品种也不断增多，技术交流和合作也有很大的进展，例如互相派遣专业代表团参观访问，互相派遣实习生，交换种子和技术资料等。
    印度是一个地大物博，文化悠久的国家。印度人民在政治上获得独立以后，迫切需要发展自己的经济。目前印度人民正在进行着建设自己伟大的祖国的事业，并且已经获得许多重大的成就。我们相信，今后随着中印两国建设事业的进展，两国间的经济、文化关系将会获得更进一步的发展。
    印度在我国首次举办的展览会是一个丰富多彩的展览会。通过在展览会展出的各种工业产品，著名的纺织品和精美的手工艺品等，将使中国人民更加深刻地看到印度人民的创造性劳动的成果。同时，也使我们获得一个良好的机会，向你们学习一切有益的东西。这样，中印友好就能随着时间的前进不断地丰富，不断地发展。我们相信，这个展览会将进一步促进中印两国间经济、文化的交流，并有助于我们两国十亿爱好和平的人民友谊和合作。
    我们预祝印度展览会获得巨大的成功！
    中印友好万岁！
