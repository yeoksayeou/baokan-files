    This Newspaper Reports: Zhou Dajue, a teaching assistant at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and rightist, has always harbored a hostile attitude towards socialism. After the Hungarian incident, he refused the work assigned by the teaching and research section and spent all day collecting materials, preparing to write anti-communist and anti-socialist articles. After the rectification began, he believed the time was ripe, and wrote "My Views on the Current Situation." He absurdly believed that the root cause of the "three evils" was "relations of production," and that only "changing the system" could "resolve the contradictions." Therefore, he maliciously proposed that "the leadership of the Party should gradually withdraw from the production system." Zhou Dajue presented this absurd article to rightist leaders Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and others, and distributed it to various places. In a letter to rightist Ge Peiqi, he said that he felt "inner resonance" with the words "kill the Communist Party," and would be grateful if he could introduce some people with similar views. He also妄想 (wàngxiǎng - presumptuously) wanted to translate it into English and send it abroad.

    拒绝工作写反动文章
    周大觉向右派头目献策
    本报讯　北京航空学院助教、右派分子周大觉一向对社会主义抱着敌视的态度。匈牙利事件发生后，他拒绝教研室分配的工作，整天忙于搜集材料，准备编写反共反社会主义的文章。在整风开始后，他认为时机已到，就写出“我对目前形势的看法”。他荒谬地认为三害产生的根源是“生产关系”，只有“改变制度”的办法才能“解决矛盾”。所以他就恶毒的提出，“党的领导应逐渐退出生产体系”。周大觉把这篇荒谬透顶的文章献给右派头目章伯钧、罗隆基等人，并散发各地。他在给右派分子葛佩琦的信上说，对“要杀共产党”的话感到“内心共鸣”，如果能介绍一些与他有共同观点的人，则不胜感激。他还妄想译成英文寄到国外去。
