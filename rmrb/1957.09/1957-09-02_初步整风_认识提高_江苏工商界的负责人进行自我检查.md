Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 1st: Over one hundred people attending the enlarged meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, after conducting a major debate with rightists such as Qian Sunqing, first carried out preliminary rectification to prepare for the full-scale rectification movement in industrial and commercial circles.

    After the implementation of joint state-private ownership of all trades in capitalist industry and commerce, the industrial and commercial circles in Jiangsu Province generally believed that: after the capitalists handed over their enterprises, they no longer had duality. Many people, while inclined to accept socialism, were still attached to capitalism; while taking fixed interest, they did not admit to exploitation; while wanting to remove the label of bourgeois, they had no determination to reform; while requesting to join the trade union, they looked down on the working class. During the period of great airing of views, right-leaning thoughts generally rose, and many people resonated with rightists. In the anti-rightist struggle, they showed varying degrees of leniency.

    Over the past week, through self-criticism, individual conversations, and mutual assistance in groups, many people have exposed ideas and statements to varying degrees of dissatisfaction with the leadership of the Communist Party, attacking and excluding public representatives, refusing to reform, and despising the working class. After seeing Li Weihan, the head of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, talking about the rectification of industry and commerce circles, they realized that these words and deeds came from the reactionary standpoint of the bourgeoisie. Leng Yu, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, after preliminary inspection and criticism, believed that his firm bourgeois position had not yet changed, therefore, during the airing of views, he had erroneous remarks and thoughts such as "The lack of coordination in public-private relations is mainly caused by the public side emphasizing class relations." He said: "Only through serious rectification and changing the bourgeois standpoint can we pass the socialist test politically and ideologically." Zhang Jingli, vice chairman of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said in his self-criticism: "During the period of great airing of views, I did not offend the Communist Party or the industrial and commercial circles, and adopted a policy of self-preservation. Today, measured from a socialist standpoint, a middle-of-the-road attitude in the struggle between the two paths is actually a bourgeois standpoint."

    In the past, most of those who were capitalist agents, those who received less fixed interest, or those who had left the enterprise, believed that they had been reformed "almost", and were eager to remove the label of bourgeois. In this criticism, they also began to realize that this idea was wrong. Zhang Yunxi, deputy chairman of the Changzhou City Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: When the rightists in Changzhou City launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, I thought that their remarks, although stemming from their class essence, did not go beyond the socialist track.” Now he realizes that “failing to thoroughly reform from the standpoint will increase the contradictions between myself and the Communist Party and socialist society.”

    Through this preliminary rectification, the leading figures in the province's industrial and commercial circles have improved their understanding and feel that it is not that there is no duality, but that the negative side of the bourgeoisie seriously harms the socialist cause. If it is not thoroughly reformed, it will lead the industrial and commercial circles onto a dangerous path. These changes in understanding have laid an ideological foundation for further in-depth anti-rightist struggle.

### 初步整风  认识提高  江苏工商界的负责人进行自我检查

    初步整风  认识提高
    江苏工商界的负责人进行自我检查
    据新华社南京1日电  出席民建江苏省工作委员会和江苏省工商业联合会委员扩大会议的一百多人，在同钱孙卿等右派分子进行大辩论之后，先行作初步整风，为在工商界全面开展整风运动作好准备。
    资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营以后，江苏省工商界普遍认为：资本家交出企业，就没有两面性了。有不少人，既倾向于接受社会主义，又留恋资本主义，既拿定息，又不承认是剥削，既想摘资产阶级帽子，又无决心改造；既要求加入工会，又看不起工人阶级。在大鸣大放中，右倾思想普遍抬头，不少人与右派分子共鸣，在反右派斗争中，又表现不同程度的温情主义。
    一周来，经过自我检查、个别交谈和小组互助，很多人暴露出存在着不同程度的不服气共产党领导、攻击和排斥公方代表、拒绝改造、鄙视工人阶级等思想和言论。他们看到中共中央统战部部长李维汉关于工商界整风问题的谈话以后，觉悟到他们的这些言行都是出自资产阶级的反动立场。民建江苏省工作委员会主任委员冷遹，经过初步检查和批判，认为自己牢固的资产阶级立场还未转变，因此，在大鸣大放中曾有“公私关系不协调，主要是公方强调阶级关系所造成的”等错误言论和想法。他说：“只有认真整风，改变资产阶级立场，才能在政治上、思想上过社会主义的关”。省工商联副主任委员张敬礼在自我批判时说：“在大鸣大放中，我既不得罪共产党，又不得罪工商界，采取了明哲保身的态度。今天站在社会主义立场上来衡量，在两条道路的斗争中，中间态度实际上就是资产阶级立场。”
    以往是资本家代理人、拿定息少的人、或者已经脱离企业的人，大多数认为自己已经改造得“差不多了”，急于摘资产阶级帽子，在这次批判中，也开始认识到这种想法是错误的。常州市工商联副主任委员张允溪说：当常州市右派分子向共产党猖狂进攻时，我却认为他们的言论虽然出自其阶级本质，并没有超越社会主义轨道。”现在他体会到，“不从立场上彻底改造，就会使自己与共产党、社会主义社会的矛盾加大。”
    全省工商界的领导人物，通过这次初步整风，认识有所提高，感到不是没有两面性，而是资产阶级消极的一面，严重地危害着社会主义事业，如不彻底改造，就会导致工商界走上危险的道路。这些认识上的改变，为进一步深入开展反右派斗争打下了思想基础。
