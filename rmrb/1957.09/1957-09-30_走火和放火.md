Careless Fire and Arson
Fan Wenlan

We have all read Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," in which the eighth topic is about letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence, and mutual supervision. Intellectuals in general are particularly interested in letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Because once they have knowledge, they always want to express it.

For the academic community, the garden of a hundred schools of thought contending is indeed very broad. It only has six criteria as boundaries, and the most important are only the two: the socialist path and the leadership of the Party. Some arguments occasionally cross the line; a reminder and they come back, it's not a big deal.

This is like people living in houses, having the freedom to smoke, light lamps, cook, and use stoves, with various uses of fire. Accidentally, carelessly, a spark flies into the wastepaper basket, burning some things; this is called a careless fire (走火). If a careless fire occurs, quickly put it out. Some are too careless, and the fire becomes a disaster; this is called a fire (失火). A fire is certainly a big trouble, but it is unintentional. If the situation is not too serious, a sincere apology to the neighbors is enough. In academic debate, sometimes the debate goes further and further, going beyond the boundaries, which is like a careless fire or a fire. Experience can teach people to be more careful, but there is absolutely no reason to never use fire again, and the neighbors will certainly not prohibit them from using fire again.

Arson is a completely different situation. Arson is a crime, and arsonists are called arsonists, because they take advantage of people's freedom to use fire and intentionally want to burn down the entire house. Right-wing elements use the policy of a hundred schools of thought contending, wear some academic cloaks, put on the mask of scholars, use two-faced tactics, and in an organized, planned, programmatic, and strategic way, launch a frenzied attack on the Party, attempting to abolish the Party's leadership and the socialist path, and restore the rule of capitalism in China, which is actually restoring the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. They harbor the ambition to burn down the People's Republic of China and are arsonists of the state. Their crimes must be thoroughly investigated, and we must not let go until all their crimes are eliminated.

The arsonists Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Zhenhan and their gang have all the evidence, both testimonial and material. Here are just some examples of their writings. First, look at Fei Xiaotong's "A Few Words on Sociology," Wu Jingchao's "Does Sociology Still Have a Place in New China?" Chen Zhenhan's "Some of Our Opinions on the Current Economic Science Work," and then compare them with Zeng Zhaolun and others' "Several Opinions on Issues Related to China's Scientific System," which reflects the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance in scientific work, the Guangming Daily's short commentary on June 9th entitled "Opening Up a New Path for Mutual Supervision," and the People's Daily's publication on July 4th of "An Emergency Meeting Convened by Zhang Bojun," etc. Their ambition and plan to start a big fire are clear enough, not to mention many other testimonial and material evidence. They cannot escape, and now it depends on whether they can understand the principle of "turning back is the shore."

The academic community's contention of a hundred schools of thought is completely different from the political conspiracy activities carried out by right-wing elements under the guise of academia. Accidental careless fires and fires are completely different from the deliberate arson committed by right-wing elements to oppose the Party and socialism. Arson must be strictly prohibited, and contention must continue to be promoted. These are all firm policies and well-known facts.

Will the anti-rightist struggle affect the development of the contention of a hundred schools of thought? Normally, it should not, but it may cause some misunderstandings that need to be explained.

First, the right-wing elements put on a mournful face and complained to people, saying, "Look, didn't the Communist Party advocate the contention of a hundred schools of thought and that speakers are not guilty? I responded to the call and really spoke out, but unexpectedly, speaking out led to guilt. Don't you think it's unfair!" Those who believe them have not thought about the fact that the contention of a hundred schools of thought is a manifestation of contradictions among the people, and of course, speakers are not guilty. The right-wing elements' calls, like those of an owl, are to oppose the Party and socialism, and they are reaping what they sow. It has nothing to do with speakers not being guilty.

If people mistakenly believe the nonsense of the right-wing elements, they will have some concerns about the contention of a hundred schools of thought.

Second, some people hold the illusion of academic supremacy and being completely divorced from politics, thinking that what the right-wing elements are saying is also a kind of academic argument and should not be treated as a political issue. The anti-rightist struggle lacks guarantees for the contention of a hundred schools of thought. They have not considered that any academic field ultimately serves a certain society and politics. However, academic debate and political struggle each have their own scope. Since the right-wing elements use their so-called academia as a tool for political attack, they have already exceeded the scope of academic debate. How can academic workers who support the Party and socialism not expose their true colors and counterattack them?

If the scope of academic debate and political struggle is not distinguished, people will have some misunderstandings about the contention of a hundred schools of thought.

Third, some people originally had some problems in their thinking. During the blooming and contending period, they unconsciously resonated with the right-wing elements. Later, they realized that they had caused a careless fire or a fire and felt heavy-hearted, closing their doors and studying Nan Rong's "three repetitions of Bai Gui," unwilling to speak again. But a careless fire or a fire is very different from arson. Moreover, if there are problems in thinking, one should actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle to treat these problems. One should also continue to participate in the contention of a hundred schools of thought to continuously improve the health of one's thinking.

If one does not want to seek progress by correcting mistakes, people will be somewhat negative about the contention of a hundred schools of thought.

Concerns can be dispelled, misunderstandings can be corrected, and negativity can be transformed into positivity. All these kinds of problems can be solved; as long as you think calmly, all kinds of problems can be solved easily. We might as well look back at the situation after the policy of a hundred schools of thought contending was announced. Based on the policy of a hundred schools of thought contending, the academic community freely launched debates in both the natural sciences and the social sciences. In the social sciences, in particular, the debate was more active. In terms of history, many historians freely put forward their own views, freely criticized different opinions, and freely counter-criticized different opinions. This situation is very noticeable when one flips through history journals. The contention in the historical field is not limited to written debate, but also advocates oral debate. For example, Peking University specially set up a history lecture series, inviting domestic historians, as well as foreign historians, including those from capitalist countries, to give lectures. This is a good start, and some universities will definitely follow suit. Who can say that the contention is not free enough? Who can say that the freedom of contention is hindered? Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Zhenhan and other right-wing elements, under the guise of names, implemented anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. They are not one of the schools in the academic community, but political careerists of the bourgeoisie. Of course, they are not entitled to the freedom of a hundred schools of thought contending, and what they deserve is only the head-on attack of the people. The events of the past six months or so are still vivid in our minds. The garden of a hundred schools of thought contending is very broad. Isn't this a true and definite proof?

In the future, as long as it is not for the purpose of opposing the Party and socialism, and under the guise of a hundred schools of thought contending to carry out political conspiracy activities, the academic community still has full freedom to soar like kites and leap like fish in this garden. Can we criticize the leadership of the Party and the work of socialist construction? Of course. If we see certain shortcomings and mistakes, and seriously put forward positive criticisms and suggestions, it is not only possible, but also welcome. Can we criticize Marxism? Of course. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Marxists should not be afraid of anyone's criticism. On the contrary, Marxists must temper themselves in the criticisms of the people, in the storms of struggle, develop themselves, and expand their positions." Marxists constantly have opponents to face, helping themselves to get opportunities for tempering, development, and expansion. From this point of view, it should be a welcome and good thing.

The contention of a hundred schools of thought must, of course, have debate. Marxists are not afraid of people's criticism, and critics of Marxism should not be afraid of people's counter-criticism. We should only obey objective truth. Although Wang Shouren and Wang Gen were idealists, I think their spirit of debate is worth learning. Wang Gen met Wang Shouren for the first time and engaged in a fierce debate. As a result, he changed from sitting at the top to sitting on the side, and then from sitting on the side to kneeling down and calling himself a disciple. After thinking about it when he went back, he felt that his reasons were still quite numerous. When he met Wang Shouren the next day, he declared that he was canceling his disciple status, and then sat at the top to start the debate again. The result was still a failure, and he knelt down again, eventually becoming Wang's top disciple. If a hundred schools adopt such an attitude to contend, it is a serious and earnest contention, which will be of great benefit to academic development.

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our country is developing vigorously in all aspects, and the academic community is no exception. Under the guidance of the policy of a hundred schools of thought contending, the atmosphere is lively and prosperous. Academic scum like Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Zhenhan, and other right-wing elements once tarnished the garden of a hundred schools of thought contending with political conspiracy activities. Our colleagues in the academic community must ruthlessly fight against those scum, and be sure to achieve a complete victory, so that our garden becomes cleaner and more beautiful.

    走火和放火
    范文澜
    我们都读过毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，其中第八个题目是讲百花齐放、百家争鸣、长期共存、互相监督。一般知识分子对百花齐放、百家争鸣，特别感到兴趣。因为既然有了知识，总想把这些知识有所表现。
    对学术界说来，百家争鸣的园地，确实是十分宽广。它仅仅有六条标准作界线，最重要的还只有社会主义道路和党的领导两条。有些议论偶然越出了界线，提醒一下，跑回来就是了，也不是什么了不起的事情。
    这好比人住在房屋里，可以吸烟、点灯、做饭、生炉子，有种种用火的自由。偶然不小心，火星飞进字纸篓，烧坏了一些东西，这叫做走火。走了火，赶快救熄就成。也有太不小心，火烧起来成了灾，这叫做失火。失火固然闯祸不小，但事出无心，如果情节还不算严重，给四邻恳切地道个歉也就差不多。学术界争鸣，有时越鸣越远，鸣出了界线，等于走火、失火。经验可以教人变得小心些，但决没有因此永远不用火的道理，四邻也决不会禁止他再用火。
    放火，情形就完全不同。放火是有罪的，放火的人叫做放火犯，因为他们利用人有用火的自由，有意想把房屋整个烧掉。右派分子利用百家争鸣的方针，披一些学术的外衣，戴一副学者的面具，使用两面手法，有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线地向党猖狂进攻，企图取消党的领导和社会主义道路，恢复资本主义在中国的统治，实际是恢复帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治。他们抱着烧掉中华人民共和国的野心，是国家的放火犯。他们的罪恶必须彻底追究，不把他们的罪恶全部扫除，决不能松手。
  　放火犯费孝通、吴景超、陈振汉这一伙子，人证物证，一概俱全。这里只举一些他们写的文字为例。先看看费孝通的“关于社会学说几句话”，吴景超的“社会学在新中国还有地位么？”陈振汉的“我们对于当前经济科学工作的一些意见”等等文字，再和反映了章罗联盟在科学工作方面的阴谋的、曾昭抡等人所起草的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”，光明日报6月9日发表题为“为互相监督开拓了新路”的短评，以及7月4日人民日报登载的“章伯钧召集的一次紧急会议”等文字对照一下，他们放大火的野心和计划，已经足够明白，何况还有许多其他的人证物证。他们想躲闪是躲闪不了的，现在只看他们能不能懂得回头是岸这一条道理了。
    学术界百家争鸣，与右派分子假借学术名义进行政治阴谋活动，完全是两回事。偶然走火失火，与右派分子为反党反社会主义有意放火，又完全是两回事。放火必须严厉禁止，争鸣必须继续提倡，这都是确定不移的方针，也都是人所共知的事实。
    反右派斗争会不会影响百家争鸣的开展呢？照常理说是不会的，但是，也可能引起一些误会，需要加以解释。
    第一种，右派分子装出一副哭丧脸对人们诉苦说，你看，共产党不是提倡百家争鸣，言者无罪么？我响应号召，真的鸣了，不料鸣出罪过来，你看冤不冤！听信的人没有想一想百家争鸣是人民内部矛盾的表现，当然言者无罪，右派分子那种飞鸮之鸣，是要反党反社会主义，咎由自取，和言者无罪没有什么丝毫的关系。
    如果误信了右派分子的胡说，人们就会对百家争鸣有些顾虑。
    第二种，有些人抱着学术至上，与政治绝缘的幻想，以为右派分子讲的也是一种学术，不应该当作政治问题，反右派斗争就是百家争鸣缺少保障。他们没有想到任何学术，归根都是为一定的社会和政治服务的。但学术争论与政治斗争究竟各有范围。右派分子既然用他们的所谓学术作为政治进攻的工具，早已超出学术争论的范围，拥护党和社会主义的学术工作者怎么可以不揭穿他们的真面目来予以反击？
    如果分不清学术争论与政治斗争的范围，人们就会对百家争鸣有些误解。
    第三种，有些人思想上本来有点毛病，在鸣放期间，不自觉地与右派分子共鸣了一番。后来发觉自己走了火或失了火，感到心境沉重，关起门来学南容的三复白圭，不愿再说话。但是走火失火，与放火大不相同。而且思想上有毛病，正应该积极参加反右派斗争，借以治疗这些毛病，也应该继续参加百家争鸣，借以不断地增进思想的健康。
    如果不想从改正错误中求得进步，人们就会对百家争鸣有些消极。
    顾虑是可以打消的，误解是可以改正的，消极是可以化为积极的，如此等等的问题，都是可以解决的；只要平心静气地想一想，各种问题都可以迎刃而解。我们不妨回顾一下在百家争鸣的方针宣布以后的景象。学术界本着百家争鸣的方针，无论在自然科学方面，无论在社会科学方面，都自由地展开了争论。特别是社会科学方面，争论更显得活跃。就历史学来说，许多史学工作者自由地提出自己的主张，自由地提出对不同意见的批评，也自由地对不同意见提出反批评，一翻史学刊物，这种情形是很显著的。史学界争鸣不只限于笔鸣，而且还提倡舌鸣。例如北京大学特设史学讲座，邀请国内史学工作者，也邀请外国包括资本主义国家的史学工作者登坛讲学。这是一个很好的开端，一定还会有些大学继之而起。有谁能说鸣还不够自由呢？有谁能说争的自由受到阻碍呢？费孝通、吴景超、陈振汉等右派分子，假借名义，实行反党反社会主义，他们不是学术界中的一家而是资产阶级的政治野心家，他们当然不得享受百家争鸣的自由，理应得到的只能是人民的迎头痛击。大半年来的事情，历历如在眼前，百家争鸣的园地十分宽广，这不是千真万确的证明么？
    今后，只要不是以反党反社会主义为目的，假借百家争鸣来进行政治阴谋活动，学术界在这个园地里，仍然有鸢飞鱼跃的充分自由。能不能对党的领导和社会主义建设工作加以批评呢？当然可以。如果看到有某些缺点错误，认真地提出积极性的批评和建议，不只是可以，而且还要受到欢迎。能不能批评马克思主义呢？当然可以。毛主席指示我们说：“马克思主义者不应该害怕任何人批评。相反，马克思主义者就是要在人们的批评中间，就是要在斗争的风雨中间，锻炼自己，发展自己，扩大自己的阵地”。马克思主义者不断地有来将对阵，帮助自己得到锻炼发展扩大的机会，从这一意义上说，应该是值得欢迎的好事情。
    百家争鸣，当然要有辩论。马克思主义者不怕人们的批评，马克思主义的批评者也应该不怕人们的反批评。我们应该只服从客观的真理。王守仁和王艮虽然是唯心论者，但是他们的论战的精神，我看很可以学习。王艮第一天见王守仁，进行剧烈的辩论，结果是从上坐改侧坐，又从侧坐改下拜称弟子。回去一想，觉得自己道理还蛮多，第二天见王守仁，声明取消弟子名义，再据上坐展开辩论，结果还是失败，重新下拜，终于成为王门大弟子。百家采取这样的态度来争鸣，就是严肃认真的争鸣，就会对学术发展有很大的好处。
    我们国家在党和毛主席领导之下，各个方面都蓬勃地在发展，学术界也并不例外，在百家争鸣的方针指导下，气象是活泼兴旺的。学术界败类费孝通、吴景超、陈振汉等等右派分子，曾经以政治阴谋活动玷污了百家争鸣的园地，我们学术界同仁必须无情地和那些败类作斗争，务必取得全胜的战果，让我们的园地变得更加洁净、更加美丽。
