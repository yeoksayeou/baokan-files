The great struggle to criticize bourgeois right-wing elements currently unfolding nationwide is, in essence, a life-or-death struggle for the democratic parties between taking the socialist road or the capitalist road. Since liberation eight years ago, although members of the democratic parties have experienced the Five Anti Movements and the Three Great Transformations, their understanding of the two-road issue has generally not reached a final resolution. Therefore, how to carry the anti-rightist struggle to a complete victory is the urgent task of the democratic parties. The social foundation of the democratic parties is the national bourgeoisie, the upper-level petty bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals. Judging from the current situation of the democratic parties, they are still bourgeois political parties in general. This indicates that the democratic parties still need to make arduous efforts to achieve a complete victory in the anti-rightist struggle.

Our situation in the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), is basically the same, but due to the influence of historical origins, the seriousness of the problem and the arduousness of the struggle are increased. RCCK members are mainly former Kuomintang and upper-middle class people with historical ties to the Kuomintang. They have all kinds of connections with the Kuomintang reactionaries, and some even belonged to figures in the reactionary ruling clique who only turned to the people after the victory of the people's revolution. Among these people, a portion can earnestly transform themselves, change their original political stance, resolutely support the leadership of the Party, and take the socialist road, forming a small number of leftists within the RCCK. Another portion, although participating in the RCCK, are unwilling to accept or even resist transformation, unwilling to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the socialist road. Most of these people are old hands at opposing communism and the people in the past, and are good at the two-faced style of old politicians, and are accustomed to creating disturbances. This is the right wing that adheres to the reactionary position. There is also a relatively large number of people who, after joining the RCCK, a small number have gradually transformed and practiced, and their positions have changed, thus approaching the left wing. The majority, on the surface, are willing to accept transformation, accept the leadership of the Party, and take the socialist road, but they do not make serious efforts and are half-hearted. These people are the middle elements within the RCCK. They were not powerful figures in the old society, but they are emotionally quite nostalgic for the past, and are therefore easily exploited by right-wing elements, becoming their political capital for creating disturbances. This is a rough outline of the political divisions within the RCCK. From this, it is not difficult for us to see that the existence of a series of two-road struggles in the historical development of the RCCK is not accidental.

Since liberation eight years ago, whenever there has been a turning point in history, the right-wing has leveraged its influence on the middle elements to attack the Party, the people, and socialism on major issues such as political lines, organizational lines, and accepting the leadership of the Party, in order to pull the RCCK backward from the road of historical progress. Fortunately, with the strong leadership of the Party, whenever the right-wing has clamored loudly, it has always guided and encouraged the RCCK Central Committee to rely on the left wing to unite and win over the middle elements to resolutely counterattack the right-wing. In this way, the implementation of the RCCK's political and organizational lines has basically not been distorted or damaged, and the relationship between leadership and being led between the RCCK and the Party has also remained normal. Because the struggle at that time was limited to disputes on local issues, and a comprehensive, systematic, and profound criticism of the right-wing was not made, it was not possible to give the right-wing a decisive blow. The problem of finally resolving the two-road struggle of the RCCK and completely changing the political division and organizational appearance within the RCCK, is precisely why, at this historical turning point from the rampant attacks of the right-wing to the anti-rightist struggle, the seriousness of the RCCK's problems has been fully exposed.

From the existing materials that have been revealed, the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist crazy activities of the RCCK's right-wing elements include speeches and organizations, and are carried out in all aspects in coordination.

Setting fires everywhere, spreading reactionary remarks, and wantonly attacking and defaming the leadership of the Party, especially focusing on the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionaries and diplomatic relations, they play the role of "upright officials" to demand "rehabilitation" for counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and rich peasants, openly saying that "the Soviet Union is not as good as the United States." They are actually speaking for the enemies of the state and the people.

Using "politician and rogue" methods, from the central to the local organizations, they established a vertically commanded and fully deployed secret network, such as the Chen Mingshu clique. They also organized a secret alliance from within the RCCK to student masses to actually instigate "great democracy," such as the Huang Shaohong, Tan Tiwu, and Lin Xiling alliance. In addition, there are many large and small right-wing reactionary groups in various places. From top to bottom, from inside to outside, they coordinated horizontally and vertically to attack the Party.

Seizing leadership and controlling organizations, obstructing the development of the anti-rightist struggle, this serious situation has been discovered in provinces, cities, counties, and even at the grassroots level. For example, the leadership organization of the RCCK in Shandong Province, the People's Bank branch of the RCCK in Tianjin, and the 15th branch of the RCCK in Beijing have either been paralyzed in the struggle or are on the verge of disintegration.

The above situation is closely related to the social foundation and historical origins of the RCCK. It also shows that this anti-rightist struggle is indeed a serious historical test for the RCCK.

In the past two months of the RCCK's anti-rightist struggle, although 439 right-wing elements have been exposed from the central, provincial, and municipal-level organizations and some grassroots organizations, the development of the struggle is not yet widespread. Beijing is more developed, while other provinces and cities are generally lagging behind Beijing, and some are lagging far behind. The struggle generally remains above the provincial and municipal levels, and is rarely popularized to grassroots organizations. Secondly, the development is uneven. For example, the grassroots organizations of institutions and schools have been mobilized, while the grassroots organizations in other areas have not; this grassroots organization has started, while that grassroots organization has not yet started. Furthermore, some local organizations have begun the anti-rightist struggle, but it is not thorough or deep enough, the masses have not been mobilized, the middle elements have not been won over, the momentum is not strong, and it is stagnant. Fourthly, some local organizations have unsound leadership organizations, an irresolute will to fight, and even protect right-wing elements, thus the leadership is weak and ineffective, affecting the development of the struggle. These few key issues are enough to show that we need to make serious efforts in the next step.

In order to promote the comprehensive development of the struggle, I believe that first, the RCCK organization must truly accept the leadership of the Party in every link of the struggle, and under the leadership of the Party, form a strong anti-rightist front with institutions, schools, enterprises, and all sectors of society. All aspects should closely coordinate, expand the momentum of the struggle, and give the right-wing elements a decisive blow. Second, strengthen the education of the anti-rightist struggle in the struggle to further clarify the significance of the anti-rightist struggle to members and improve the will to fight. Third, grasp the leadership and implement the struggle to the grassroots organizations, and popularize it to all grassroots organizations, truly achieving "wherever there are right-wing elements, the struggle should be waged." Fourth, in the process of developing the struggle, organizations at all levels must actively strive for the middle elements to join the struggle and strengthen the combat power. Fifth, rectify the organization in a timely manner, summarize experience, to improve combat power. Through the above efforts, the RCCK's anti-rightist struggle can be popularized to all grassroots levels and strive for a complete victory in the anti-rightist struggle. Thus, further develop the general rectification movement to transform the political stance of members, change the political face of the organization, and enable the RCCK to gain new life from this struggle and truly become a political force serving socialism.

    必须从斗争中争取新生
    中国国民党革命委员会秘书长　梅龚彬
    当前在全国范围开展的批判资产阶级右派分子的伟大斗争，对于各民主党派来说，实质上就是走社会主义道路抑走资本主义道路的生死斗争。解放八年以来，各民主党派成员虽然经历了五大运动和三大改造，但在认识上对两条道路问题，一般还没有达到最后的解决，因此，如何把反右派斗争进行到彻底胜利，确为各民主党派当前的迫切任务。民主党派的社会基础是民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和它们的知识分子，就各民主党派现状看，总的方面，还是资产阶级性的政党，这说明各民主党派要在反右派斗争中取得彻底胜利，还需要作艰巨的努力。
    我们民革的情况，基本相同，但由于历史根源的影响，更增加了问题的严重性和斗争的艰巨性。民革成员，主要是原国民党及与国民党有历史关系的中上层人士，他们和国民党反动派有千丝万缕的联系，有的还是属于反动统治集团里的人物，直到人民革命胜利后，才投向人民。这些人中间有一部分人能够认真改造自己，改变了原来的政治立场，坚决拥护党的领导，走社会主义道路，形成民革党内人数不多的左派。另一部分人虽然参加到民革来，却不愿接受甚至抗拒改造，不愿接受共产党领导和走社会主义道路，这些人多数是过去反共反人民的老手，又擅长旧政客的两面派作风，惯会兴风作浪，这是坚持反动立场的右派。又有一部分人人数较多，他们参加民革后，其中小部分人，经过逐步改造、实践，立场有所转变，从而接近左派；另有大多数人，表面上愿意接受改造，接受党的领导，走社会主义道路，但并不认真努力，三心二意，这些人是民革党内的中间分子，他们在旧社会并非当权人物，但情绪上颇为留恋过去，因而易受右派分子利用，成为他们兴风作浪的政治资本。这就是民革党内政治分野的大概。从这中间我们不难看出，在民革的历史发展过程中，存在着一系列的两条道路斗争，不是偶然的。
    解放八年以来，每当历史的转折关头，右派辄挟其对中间分子的影响，在政治路线、组织路线和接受党的领导等重大问题上面，向党、向人民、向社会主义进攻，要把民革从历史前进的道路上拉向后退。幸赖党的坚强领导，每当右派大肆叫嚣之际，总是指引、鼓励民革中央依靠左派团结和争取中间分子予右派以坚决反击。这样，才使民革的政治路线与组织路线的执行，基本未受到曲解与破坏，民革和党之间的领导被领导的关系也保持正常。由于当时斗争只限于局部问题上的争论对右派未能作全面、系统深刻的批判，因而亦未能予右派以决定性的打击，最后解决民革两条道路斗争的问题，以彻底改变民革党内政治分野和组织面貌，正因于此，在这次从右派猖狂进攻到反右斗争的历史大转折的关头，民革问题的严重，便充分暴露出来了。
    从现有的揭发出来的材料看，民革右派分子的反党反人民反社会主义的疯狂活动，有言论，有组织而且是从各个方面配合进行的。
    随处点火，散播反动言论，大肆攻击诋毁党的领导，尤其集矢于肃反问题和外交关系方面，他们扮着“青天”为反革命分子、地主富农要求“平反”，公然说“苏联不如美国好”。竟为国家、人民的敌人说话。
    运用“政客、流氓”手法从中央到地方到地方组织建立垂直指挥，全面张开的秘密集团网，例如陈铭枢集团。又组织从民革党内到学生群众中去实际策动搞“大民主”的秘密联盟，例如黄绍竑、谭惕吾、林希翎联盟，此外，各地大小右派反动集团还很多。从上到下，从内到外，纵横配合，来向党进攻。
    窃据领导，把持组织，阻挠反右派斗争的开展，这种严重情况，省、市、县以至基层均有发现，例如山东省民革领导机构，天津市民革的人民银行支部，北京市民十五支部不是斗争中陷于瘫痪，便是濒于解体。
    上述情况是与民革的社会基础和历史根源密切相关的，同时也说明这次反右派斗争，对民革确是一个严重的历史考验。
    两个多月来的民革反右派斗争，虽然已经从中央，省市级组织和一部分基层组织中间，揭露出右派分子四百三十九人，但斗争开展还不普遍，北京较开展，其他省市一般落后于北京，有的落后很远；斗争一般还停留在省、市级以上，普遍到基层组织的很少。其次是开展得不平衡，如机关学校的基层组织动起来了，其他方面的基层组织未动；这个基层开始了，那个基层还未开步。再次有些地方组织虽已开始反右派斗争，但进行得不透不深，群众未发动，中间分子未争取，威势不壮，停滞不前。又次有些地方组织领导机构不健全，斗争意志不坚决，甚至庇护右派分子，因而领导软弱无力，影响斗争开展。从这几个较为关键性的问题，已足够说明我们在下一步需要作严重的努力。
    为推动斗争全面开展，我认为今后第一、民革组织必须在斗争每一环节上真正接受党的领导，并在党的领导下，和机关、学校、企业和社会各界结成坚强的反右派战线。各方面密切配合，扩大斗争威势，予右派分子以决定性打击。第二、在加强斗争中开展反右派斗争的教育，使成员进一步明确反右派斗争的重大意义，提高战斗意志。第三、抓紧领导，把斗争贯彻到基层组织，并普及于一切基层组织中，真正做到“哪里有右派，就斗争到哪里”。第四、各级组织在斗争开展过程中，必须积极争取中间分子，投入斗争，壮大作战力量。第五、及时整顿组织，总结经验，以提高战斗力量。通过上述努力，就可以使民革反右派斗争普遍到一切基层，争取反右派斗争的彻底胜利。从而进一步开展一般整风运动改造成员的政治立场，改变组织政治面貌，使民革从这次斗争中获得新生，真正成为为社会主义服务的政治力量。
