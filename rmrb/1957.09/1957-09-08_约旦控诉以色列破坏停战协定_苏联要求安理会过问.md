Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, New York dispatch: During the Security Council's discussion of the Palestine question on the 6th, Soviet representative Sobolev spoke in support of Jordan's accusation against Israel for violating the armistice agreement. He said that the Security Council needs to look into Israel's actions that violate the armistice agreement. Israel's constant threats to Arab countries serve the interests of certain imperialist countries.

Sobolev also said that it is no accident that the United States is currently exerting crude pressure on certain Arab countries at a time when relations between Israel and Arab countries are becoming tense.

The Security Council meeting on the 6th was convened at the request of Jordan. Jordan accused Israelis of digging trenches in the neutral zone south of Jerusalem in late July, in violation of the armistice agreement. However, at the last moment before the meeting, the Israeli representative also put forward a "counter-accusation" aimed at diverting the discussion.

The meeting began with a discussion of the agenda and procedural issues. The Iraqi representative argued that the two accusations should be studied separately in the order in which they were presented, emphasizing that discussing the two accusations simultaneously would only confuse the issue. This view was supported by the Soviet representative. However, representatives of Western countries expressed opposition. The meeting decided to first hear the views of the parties involved.

The United Nations Secretary-General announced that the United Nations body monitoring compliance with the armistice agreement could submit a report to the Security Council in two weeks, explaining the facts listed in the Jordanian representative's letter. The report based on the Israeli representative's letter could be submitted at a later date.

Finally, the Security Council decided without a vote not to discuss the two accusations until the relevant reports were received.

    约旦控诉以色列破坏停战协定
    苏联要求安理会过问
    据新华社7日讯　纽约消息：苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫6日在安全理事会讨论巴勒斯坦问题时，发言支持约旦对以色列违反停战协定的控诉。他说，安全理事会有必要过问以色列违反停战协定的行动，以色列不断威胁阿拉伯国家，是在为一些帝国主义国家的利益服务。
    索波列夫还说，目前，正当以色列同阿拉伯国家的关系紧张起来的时候，美国在对某些阿拉伯国家施加粗暴压力，这不是偶然的。
    6日的安全理事会会议是应约旦的请求而召开的。约旦指责以色列人违反停战协定在7月下旬在耶路撒冷南部中立地区挖掘战壕。但是，在会议前一刻，以色列代表也提出了一项目的在于转移讨论目标的“反控诉”。
    会议从讨论议程和程序问题开始。伊拉克代表主张按照提出的次序分别来研究这两个控诉，他强调指出，同时讨论两个控诉，只会使问题混乱。这个意见得到了苏联代表的支持。但是，西方国家代表表示反对。会议决定先听取当事双方的意见。
    联合国秘书长宣布，联合国监视停战协定遵守情况的机构可在两周以后向安理会提出报告说明约旦代表信中列举的事实，根据以色列代表的信所作的报告，可以在较晚一些时候提出。
    最后，安全理事会未经表决决定在获得有关报告以前不讨论这两个控诉。
