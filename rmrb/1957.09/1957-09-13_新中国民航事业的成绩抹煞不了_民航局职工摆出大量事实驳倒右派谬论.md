　　The Achievements of New China's Civil Aviation Cannot Be Denied:
　　Civil Aviation Administration Employees Present a Large Number of Facts to Refute Rightist Fallacies

　　(Our Newspaper) This paper reports that the vast number of employees of the Civil Aviation Administration of China directly under the central government have launched a reasoning struggle against rightist elements. Rightist elements Wu Jingyan, Wu Yishou, Shen Heling, Xu Gongyin, Jiang Shushan, etc., have been completely isolated in the face of truth and facts, and have fully revealed their true colors.
　　Wu Jingyan, deputy section chief of the Transportation Department, is a consistently anti-Party rightist element. After the "Two Airlines" (pseudo-China and Central Airlines) uprising, he claimed to be the "acting general manager," swaggering and deceiving people everywhere, and using various despicable means to win over personnel from the "Two Airlines," attempting to compete with the Civil Aviation Administration. During the rectification campaign, he stirred up trouble everywhere, saying, "Civil aviation does not cherish talent," and "the Party's policy toward intellectuals is like putting straw sandals in the refrigerator."
　　Xu Gongyin, another rightist element in this office and an advertising designer, attempted to negate the achievements of civil aviation construction over the years, saying, "In eight years, the Civil Aviation Administration has not grasped the key, staggering from side to side, at a loss." He also openly spread rumors, saying, "Two Airlines personnel have only been demoted and not promoted." He also fabricated that Yan Baomin's (personnel from the "Two Airlines") death was due to persecution by the leadership of the Civil Aviation Administration, attempting to incite dissatisfaction among the "Two Airlines" personnel against the Party in order to achieve his ulterior motives.
　　Wu Yishou, a rightist element at the Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute, spread thirty fallacies against the Party and socialism. He distorted the Party's cadre policy, slandering Party members' reports as "building personal loyalty to the Party on the basis of others' pain," cursing Communist Youth League members as "palace eunuchs," and saying that activists are people who "defend the Party" and are "yes-men."
　　Shen Heling, a technician in the Design Department, brought the nine-point anti-Party program of Qian Huiyu, a rightist element from the Urban Construction Publishing House, to the office for everyone to read and discuss and supplement, inciting the masses to attack the Party. Jiang Shushan, a draftsman, openly clamored that "the Communist Party is undemocratic and dictatorial, even worse than the Kuomintang."
　　The vast number of employees of the Civil Aviation Administration, especially the personnel who participated in the "Two Airlines" uprising, cited a large number of facts based on their personal experiences at various discussion meetings to refute the various fallacies of the rightist elements.
　　Comrades such as Chen Wenhui, deputy director of the Navigation Department, who came from the "Two Airlines," said: The Party can lead the civil aviation industry, and the construction of civil aviation must also be led by the Party. In recent years, civil aviation construction has made great achievements. When the flight routes started in 1950, the routes and flight hours were extremely limited. Now the routes have spread to more than forty cities at home and abroad, and the flight hours have exceeded 40,000 hours, and the first five-year plan target was completed one year and fifteen days ahead of schedule. Professional aviation was impossible in old China, but it has developed rapidly from scratch after liberation. In particular, since the opening of flight routes, there has never been a serious accident, which has won a high reputation at home and abroad. These great achievements could not have been achieved without the leadership of the Party. Recalling the old "Two Airlines" era, the so-called "civil aviation" was actually a tool for American imperialism and bureaucratic bourgeoisie to make a fortune. Can this be said to mean that "the new civil aviation is not as good as the old civil aviation"?
　　Comrades Lu Weisen, Yang Hongliang and others from the "Two Airlines" pointed out in their speeches: We will never allow the rightist elements to slander the Party's cadre policy. They said: The Party attaches importance to the personnel of the "Two Airlines." Since the uprising of the personnel of the "Two Airlines," they have maintained high salaries, enjoyed generous treatment, and have been constantly promoted. In the "Two Airlines" period, Chinese people could not be promoted to captain; today, the co-pilots of the "Two Airlines," with the exception of one person who is restricted by physical conditions, have all been promoted to captain. Can this be said that the Party discriminates against the personnel of the "Two Airlines"? Can it be said that "the personnel of the Two Airlines have only been demoted and not promoted"?
　　The vast number of employees expressed their indignation at the "Yan Baomin forced death incident" fabricated by rightist element Xu Gongyin. Comrades such as Tang Bodou, who had worked with Yan Baomin, revealed the truth of the matter: Yan Baomin did everything in the old society, eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, and contracted serious illnesses. After liberation, the leadership tried everything possible to treat him. Later, according to his own application, he was handled with retirement. At the time of retirement, the organization gave him a retirement allowance of 1,100 yuan. Yan Baomin was deeply moved, and he also wrote a letter to express his gratitude to the organization for taking care of him. In the past, a staff member who worked in "Central Airlines" had a cold and cough, and the American doctor frowned and said, "You can't go to work without an X-ray report" (meaning you can't go to work if you have lung disease).
　　After two months of reasoning struggle, these rightist elements were unable to argue and had to lower their heads and admit their guilt. The struggle is currently developing in depth.

### 新中国民航事业的成绩抹煞不了  民航局职工摆出大量事实驳倒右派谬论

　　新中国民航事业的成绩抹煞不了
　　民航局职工摆出大量事实驳倒右派谬论
    本报讯　中国民航局直属机关广大职工同右派分子展开了说理斗争。右派分子吴景岩、吴亦寿、沈鹤龄、徐恭寅、姜书山等，在真理与事实面前，已原形毕露，完全陷于孤立。
    运输处副科长吴景岩是一贯反党的右派分子。“两航”（伪中国、中央航空公司）起义后，他自称是
  “代总经理”，到处招摇撞骗，用各种卑鄙手段笼络“两航”人员，企图与民航局分庭抗礼。整风期间，他到处煽风点火，说：“民航不爱惜人才”，“党对知识分子的政策是冰箱里放草鞋”。
    这个处另一右派分子、广告设计员徐恭寅，企图否定民航几年来的建设成绩，说：“八年了，民航局并未抓住关键，东倒西歪，无所适从”。他还公然造谣说：“两航人员只有降没有升”。他还捏造说严葆民（“两航”人员）的病死是民航局领导上迫害的，企图煽起“两航”人员对党不满，以达到他不可告人的目的。
    民航科学研究所的右派分子吴亦寿散布了三十条反党反社会主义的谬论。他歪曲党的干部政策，诬蔑党员汇报“是把个人对党的忠诚建筑在别人痛苦的基础上”，咒骂共青团员是“宫庭小太监”，说积极分子是“为党辩护”“唯唯诺诺”的人。
    设计处技术员沈鹤龄把城市建设出版社右派分子钱辉焴的九点反党纲领带到办公室传阅，要大家讨论、补充，煽动群众攻击党。描图员姜书山公开叫嚣“共产党就是不民主、独裁，比国民党还坏”。
    民航局广大职工，特别是“两航”起义人员，在各种座谈会上，以亲身体验列举了大量事实批驳了右派分子的各种谰言。
    “两航”人员、航行处副处长陈文惠等同志说：党能领导民航事业，民航建设也必须由党来领导。几年来，民航建设已经取得了巨大成绩。1950年开航时，航线和飞行时间还极有限，现在航线已遍及国内外四十几个城市，飞行时间超过了四万小时，并且提前一年又十五天完成第一个五年计划指标。专业航空在旧中国是不可能有的，而解放后从无到有迅速发展起来。特别是开航以来，从未发生过一次严重事故，在国内外博得了很高的声誉。这些巨大成绩的取得，没有党的领导是不可能的。回忆旧“两航”时代，所谓“民航”，实际上是美帝国主义和官僚资产阶级发财致富的工具。这难道能说“新民航不如旧民航”吗？
      “两航”人员陆维森、杨宏量等同志在发言中指出：绝不容许右派分子诬蔑党的干部政策。他们说：党对“两航”人员是重视的，“两航”人员起义以来一直保持高薪，享受优厚的待遇，并不断地被提拔。在“两航”时期，中国人是不能提为正驾驶的；今天，“两航”的副驾驶，除一人因身体条件受限制外，都提为正驾驶了。这难道能说党对“两航”人员歧视吗？能说“两航人员只有降没有升”吗？
    广大职工对右派分子徐恭寅捏造的“严葆民被迫死亡事件”表示十分愤慨。曾和严葆民在一起工作过的唐伯斗等同志揭开了事实的真相：严葆民在旧社会吃喝嫖赌无所不为，染上一身重病。解放后，领导上想尽一切办法给他治病，后来根据本人申请作了退职处理，退职时，组织上发给他一千一百元退职金。严葆民深受感动，他还写信表示感谢组织上对他的照顾。过去一个在“央航”工作的人员，因为伤风咳嗽，美国大夫就板起面孔说：“没有X光报告前不能上班”（意指有了肺病就不能上班）。
    经过两个月来的说理斗争，这些右派分子已无法狡辩，不得不低头认罪。目前斗争正向纵深发展。
