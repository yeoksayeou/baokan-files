Bi-Weekly Agricultural Situation
From the Beginning of Heat (August 23rd) to White Dew (September 8th)

　　The busy autumn harvest has begun successively in various regions. As of now, the early autumn crops in Shandong Province—foxtail millet, sorghum, and spring corn—have entered the harvest peak. In the five counties of Zhangbei, Shangdu, Guyuan, Kangbao, and Shangyi in the Bashang area of Hebei Province, more than 2.76 million mu of crops such as peas and flax have been harvested, accounting for approximately 29% of the area of major autumn crops in these five counties. It is expected that around the Autumn Equinox (September 23rd), the autumn harvest will enter a tense stage in various regions. This year, autumn crops in various regions are generally growing better than last year. Except for some provinces and regions that have suffered from varying degrees of reduction in production due to water and drought disasters, the total grain output of most provinces will exceed that of 1956.

　　During the autumn harvest, some problems have also emerged in various regions. Taking Shandong as an example, the order of the autumn harvest is generally not as good as the summer harvest, and phenomena such as eating green crops, theft, private harvesting, and private distribution occur from time to time. This deserves attention.

　　In the half-month period from around the Beginning of Heat to White Dew, more than a dozen cotton-producing areas, including Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, and Liaoning, have successively begun to harvest new cotton. This year, the new cotton picking work in some areas started earlier than last year. In provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, due to the further expansion of the area planted with early-maturing, high-quality cotton varieties, the new cotton picking time was advanced by about ten days compared to last year. According to reports from various regions, this year's cotton is generally growing better than last year, with tall and neat cotton plants and many bolls. According to actual harvests and reliable forecasts in Jianyang County, Sichuan, a major cotton-producing area along the Tuojiang River, the county's 120,000 mu of cotton can yield an average of about 45 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an 80% increase compared to last year (25 jin). Although the national cotton field area this year has shrunk by 6 million mu compared to last year, judging from the growth and actual harvest of cotton in various regions, the total output may exceed that of last year.

　　In about twenty days, the northern regions and parts of the Yangtze River basin will begin autumn planting. In order to create conditions for bumper harvests of summer crops such as wheat and rapeseed next year, agricultural production cooperatives in the northern regions have been actively carrying out work such as formulating wheat planting plans, accumulating fertilizer, preparing seeds, and preparing land since after the summer harvest. Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and other places have carried out rapeseed seedling cultivation, which has laid a good foundation for timely sowing of winter wheat and transplanting rapeseed. However, at present, there is a tendency for the wheat field area to decrease in some areas, the prepared fertilizer is not enough for the needs of autumn planting, wheat seeds have not been turned and dried, and not enough attention has been paid to moisture conservation. These problems need to be addressed as soon as possible.

　　半月农情
　　处暑（8月23日）——白露（9月8日）
    繁忙的秋收工作，已经在各地陆续开始了。到目前为止，山东省的早秋作物——谷子、高粱和春玉米，已进入收获大流；河北省坝上的张北、商都、沽源、康保、尚义等五县已收割豌豆、胡麻等作物二百七十六万多亩，约占五县大秋作物面积的29％。预计到“秋分”（9月23日）前后，各地的秋收工作将进入紧张阶段。今年，各地的秋季作物一般比去年长得好。除一部分遭受水、旱灾的省、区有不同程度的减产外，多数省的粮食总产量将超过1956年。
    秋收中，各地也出现了一些问题。以山东为例，秋收秩序一般不如夏收，吃青、偷盗、私收、私分等现象时有发生。这是值得引起注意的。
    从“处暑”前后到“白露”的这半个多月的时间里，先后开始收摘新棉的已经有湖北、湖南、江西、河南、浙江、江苏、山东、四川、河北、辽宁等十多个棉区。今年，有些地区的新棉采摘工作比去年开始的要早。像湖北、湖南、江西等省，由于早熟的优良棉种面积有了进一步的扩大，新棉采摘时间比去年提早了十天左右。据各地反映，今年的棉花普遍比去年长得好，棉株高大、整齐、结桃多。四川沱江沿岸盛产棉花的简阳县根据实收和可靠的预测，全县十二万亩棉花平均每亩可收皮棉四十五斤左右，比去年（二十五斤）增产80％。全国今年的棉田面积虽然比去年缩小了六百万亩，但从各地棉花成长及实收情况看，总产量可能超过去年。
    再有二十天左右的时间，北方地区及长江流域的部分就要开始秋种了。为了给明年的小麦、油菜等夏收作物丰产创造条件，北方地区的农业生产合作社，早在夏收以后，就积极地进行了制订小麦播种计划、积肥、备种、整地等工作；湖北、江西、安徽、湖南等地进行了油菜育苗工作，这就为适时播种冬小麦和移栽油菜打下了良好的基础。但是，目前有些地区的麦田面积有减少的趋势，准备的肥料也不够秋种的需要，小麦种子还没有翻晒，对保墒工作重视不够，这些问题都需要及早注意解决。
