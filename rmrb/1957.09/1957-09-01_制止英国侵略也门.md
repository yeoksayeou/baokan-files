Stop British Aggression Against Yemen
By a commentator from this newspaper

The crime of British aggression against Oman has not yet received due punishment, and now it has launched a new armed offensive against the Beda and Kataba regions of Yemen. British invading forces have not only deployed air force and tanks, but also openly violated international law by dropping poison gas bombs on Yemeni positions, causing heavy casualties to the Yemeni people. This blatant act of aggression by Britain has once again aroused great indignation in world public opinion.

Yemen is located at the mouth of the Red Sea. As early as the last century, Britain occupied the Aden region, which originally belonged to Yemen. After independence, Yemen repeatedly made legitimate demands for the recovery of Aden and waged a protracted struggle with Britain. In 1934, Yemen was forced to sign the "Treaty of Sana'a" with Britain. This treaty only vaguely stipulated that the boundary issue would be resolved within forty years. Later, Britain used the "undetermined border" situation to expand into Yemeni territory by various means and occupy Yemeni territory. After Britain's aggression against Egypt last year, British aggressive activities against Yemen became more frequent. In the past year, Yemen has lodged thirty-eight protests with Britain for this reason. But Britain has always ignored them.

Britain's insistence on armed aggression against Yemen is not only related to the plunder of Yemen's oil and mineral resources, but also inseparable from its entire colonial activities in the Middle East. According to Western newspapers, in August and September last year, while formulating a plan to invade Egypt, Britain also formulated a plan to invade Yemen, preparing to occupy Yemen immediately after igniting the war in Egypt, under the pretext of "ensuring the safety of Aden." Due to the rapid failure of the invasion of Egypt, the plan to invade Yemen could not be implemented. However, in order to compensate for the loss of its strategic position in the Suez Canal area, Britain has stepped up its aggression against Yemen. For a long time, armed provocations by British troops on the Yemeni border have been constantly occurring.

Now, while suppressing the uprising of the Omani people, Britain has launched an armed invasion of Yemen. Britain is obviously taking advantage of the tense Middle East situation caused by the recent U.S. subversive plot in Syria to fish in troubled waters and completely turn Yemen into its colony.

The Yemeni Embassy in Cairo issued a statement on August 29, accusing Britain of its aggressive crimes and requesting all peace-loving countries to urge Britain to abandon the use of force to resolve border issues. However, the British Foreign Office openly stated that it would continue its armed offensive against Yemen. This once again exposed the hideous face of aggressive British imperialism.

Britain's aggression against Yemen is part of the imperialist conspiracy to suppress the national independence movements in the Middle East. The Yemeni people's struggle against British aggression is a just struggle against colonialism to defend national independence. There is no doubt that the heroic Yemeni people will receive the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people and countries in the world. If Britain does not immediately stop this unreasonable and bellicose behavior of persisting in aggression, it will inevitably be burned to a frazzle by the flames of anti-colonialism.

    制止英国侵略也门
    本报评论员
    英国侵略阿曼的罪行尚未受到应有的制裁，现在它又对也门的贝达和卡塔巴地区发动了新的武装进攻。英国的侵略部队不仅出动了空军和坦克，而且公然违犯国际公法向也门阵地投掷毒气弹，因而使也门人民遭到很大伤亡。英国这种公然的侵略行为，又一次激起了世界舆论的极大愤慨。
    也门地处红海海口，早在上一世纪，英国就侵占了原属也门的亚丁地区。也门在独立以后曾多次提出收复亚丁的正当要求，并和英国进行了长期的斗争。1934年，也门被迫和英国签订了“萨那条约”。这个条约仅含糊规定在四十年内解决边界问题。后来，英国就利用“边界未定”的情况，用各种手段向也门境内扩张，侵占也门的领土。去年英国侵略埃及前后，英国对也门的侵略活动更加频繁。过去一年间，也门为此向英国提出的抗议先后就有三十八次之多。但是英国一直置之不理。
    英国坚持对也门的武装侵略活动，不仅和掠夺也门的石油矿藏有关，而且是和它在中东的整个殖民活动分不开的。据西方报纸披露，去年8、9月间，英国在制定侵略埃及的计划的同时，制定了侵略也门的计划，准备在燃起侵埃战火以后，立即借口“保障亚丁安全”占领也门。由于侵埃战争迅速失败，侵略也门的计划未能实施。但是，英国为了弥补它在苏伊士运河区战略阵地的丧失，却加紧了对也门的侵略。许久以来，英国军队在也门边境的武装挑衅，就不断发生了。
    现在英国在镇压阿曼人民的起义的同时，发动了对也门的武装侵略。英国显然是利用最近由于美国颠覆叙利亚的阴谋活动造成的紧张的中东局势企图混水摸鱼，把也门完全变为它的殖民地。
    也门驻开罗公使馆在8月29日发表声明，指责英国的侵略罪行，并要求一切爱好和平的国家促使英国放弃使用武力的办法来解决边界问题。但是，英国外交部竟公开表示要继续对也门进行武装进攻。这就又一次暴露了侵略成性的英帝国主义的狰狞面目。
    英国对也门的侵略是帝国主义镇压中东民族独立运动的阴谋的一部分。也门人民反抗英国侵略的斗争是保卫民族独立的反殖民主义的正义斗争。毫无疑问，英勇的也门人民将得到世界上一切爱好和平的人民和国家的同情和支持。英国如果不立即停止这种蛮横无理、坚持侵略的好战行为，必将被反殖民主义的怒火烧得焦头烂额。
