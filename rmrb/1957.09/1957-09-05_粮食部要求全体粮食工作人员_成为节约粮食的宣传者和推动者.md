Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: The Ministry of Food issued a directive today requiring all employees of the food system to actively participate in food conservation efforts.

The directive stated that the food sector bears a particularly significant responsibility for conserving food. All staff within the food system should not only lead by example, conserving food in all aspects of their work and minimizing food waste, but should also become active advocates and promoters of food conservation throughout society. Therefore, all food workers are required to actively carry out the following tasks:

(1) Establish and improve various operational systems to promote food conservation in all aspects of the business, from grain storage, management, transportation, and processing. Before grain is put into storage, farmers should be educated to dry and clean the grain they sell to the state to ensure quality, and the policy of pricing based on quality should be earnestly implemented during procurement to encourage farmers to sell high-quality grain. In grain storage, the "Four No's" campaign—no insects, no mold, no rodents/birds, and no accidents—should continue. In grain transportation, special attention should be paid to protection against wind, rain, insects, and mold damage. In grain processing, efforts should be made to improve the milling and flour extraction rates.

(2) Actively promote the importance of food conservation to urban and rural people and overcome various incorrect ideas. Through accounting, recollection, comparisons, and other methods, the importance and necessity of food conservation should be explained to the urban and rural population.

(3) Advocate planned grain consumption and strictly control grain sales. To promote planned grain consumption, it is necessary to deeply publicize the benefits of planned grain consumption, so that every individual, every family, and every collective catering unit can reasonably arrange grain consumption plans based on the spirit of thrift. To strictly control sales, in rural areas, farmers should be educated to strictly abide by the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, adhere to the "three fix" grain retention standards, and especially strengthen the education of grain-deficient farmers to "eat their own grain first, then the state's grain" and "supply when there is a shortage." At the same time, strictly manage rural sideline occupations that use grain as raw materials, and ban all speculative grain trafficking activities. In cities, strictly control sales plans.

(4) Actively cooperate with agricultural departments to educate farmers to pay attention to food conservation during grain production, harvesting, and storage.

The directive stated that food conservation is a long-term and arduous economic and political task. Food departments at all levels must give it high importance, and all food workers must become models of food conservation in all aspects of their work. At the same time, food conservation should be developed into a broader social ethos, and the food conservation movement should be carried out further on the existing foundation.

    粮食部要求全体粮食工作人员
    成为节约粮食的宣传者和推动者
    据新华社3日讯　粮食部今天发出指示，要求粮食系统全体职工积极参加粮食节约工作。
    指示说，粮食部门对节约粮食负有特别重大的责任，粮食系统的全体工作人员不仅要以身作则，在各个业务环节中节约粮食，尽量减少粮食的损耗，而且应成为整个社会在粮食节约工作上的积极宣传者和推动者。因此，要求全体粮食工作人员，积极做好以下工作：
    （一）建立与健全各项业务制度，从粮食的入库、保管、调运、加工等各个业务环节开展粮食节约工作。在粮食入库前，要教育农民把向国家交售的粮食晒干扬净，保证质量，并在收购中认真贯彻依质论价政策，鼓励农民交售好粮；在粮食保管上，要继续开展无虫、无霉、无鼠雀和无事故的四无粮仓运动；在粮食调运上，要特别做好风、雨、虫、霉害等防护工作；在粮食加工上，要努力提高出米和出粉率。
    （二）积极向城乡人民宣传节约粮食的重要意义，克服各种不正确思想。要通过算账、回忆、对比等各种办法，向城乡人民说明节约粮食的重要性和必要性。
    （三）提倡计划用粮，严格控制粮食销量。为推行计划用粮，必须深入宣传计划用粮的好处，使每个人、每个家庭、每个集体伙食单位，都能本着节约精神，合理安排用粮计划。为严格控制销量，在农村要教育农民严格服从国家的粮食统购统销政策，坚持三定留粮标准，特别是要加强对缺粮农民“先吃自己粮食，后吃国家粮食”和“什么时候缺粮、什么时候供应”的教育。同时，要严格管理农村以粮食为原料的副业，取缔一切投机贩运粮食的活动。在城市要严格控制销售计划。
    （四）积极配合农业部门，教育农民在粮食的生产、收割和保管中注意节约粮食。
    指示说，节约粮食是一件长期、艰巨的经济工作和政治任务，各级粮食部门必须给予高度的重视，全体粮食工作人员必须在各项工作上成为节约粮食的模范。同时，要使节约粮食形成一种更广泛的社会风气，把节约粮食运动在现有基础上更进一步地开展起来。
