    Odds and Ends

    West Han Railway Survey Completed
    The ground survey for the railway line between Xi'an and Hankou, which had recently completed aerial surveying, has now been completed.
    This railway line will pass through the steep Qinling Mountains, passing through Shangxian and Shangnan counties in Shaanxi, Xichuan in Henan, and Xiangfan in Hubei, reaching Hankou, a total of more than 800 kilometers. Together with the planned E-Gan Railway, it will be the shortest trunk line connecting the northwest and southeast regions of China in the future. The construction of this railway is also of great significance for reducing the transportation burden on the Longhai Railway and developing resources in the vicinity of the route.

    Refining Lanolin
    After the successful trial production of lanolin from wool washing water at the Xining Wool Processing Factory in Qinghai, production has been expanded this year, with a planned annual output of 13 tons of lanolin.
    Lanolin is an important excipient needed by the pharmaceutical industry and a valuable raw material for the production of high-end cosmetics; in the past, the lanolin used in China was imported from foreign countries at very high prices.
    Extracting lanolin from wool washing water, which used to be discharged into sewers as waste liquid, can be widely promoted in wool washing plants or wool processing factories throughout the country; wool washing plants in Tianjin, Lanzhou and other places have already sent people to this factory to learn from their experience, and relevant departments in Beijing, Chongqing and other places have also requested related information from this factory.

    西汉铁路勘测完毕
    西安到汉口间的铁路线最近已经完成航测的地面勘测工作。
    这条铁路线要穿过险峻的秦岭，经过陕西的商县、商南，河南的淅川，湖北的襄樊等县市到达汉口，全程八百多公里。它和计划兴建的鄂赣铁路是将来连接我国西北和东南地区铁路的最近干线。兴建这条铁路还对减轻陇海路的运输负担，开发沿线附近的资源都有着重要意义。 （新华社）
    提炼羊毛脂
    利用洗羊毛的水提炼羊毛脂在青海西宁绒毛加工厂试制成功以后，今年扩大了生产，全年将产十三吨羊毛脂。
    羊毛脂是医药工业所需要的一种重要调和剂，也是生产高级化妆品的贵重原料；过去我国使用的羊毛脂都从外国进口，价格很高。
    利用过去作为废液流入下水道的洗毛水提炼羊毛脂，可以在各地洗毛厂或绒毛加工厂中普遍推行；现在天津、兰州等地的洗毛厂已派人到这个厂学习经验，北京、重庆等地的有关部门也向这个厂索取了这方面的资料。 （新华社）
