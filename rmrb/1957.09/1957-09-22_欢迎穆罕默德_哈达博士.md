    Welcome Dr. Mohammad Hatta
    Bao Erhan, President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association
    Dr. Mohammad Hatta, who is visiting our country at the invitation of our Premier Zhou Enlai, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on September 22. We extend a warm welcome to the distinguished guest from afar. In the past few years, we have more than once warmly welcomed friends from Indonesia to our liberated land, including outstanding artistic song and dance troupes, outstanding composers, scholars, and prominent figures from various fields such as government, parliament, military, peace, trade unions, youth, and women. Most unforgettable was our extremely excited welcome to President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia last year. The Chinese people have also sent their representatives to visit the neighboring Republic of Indonesia more than once. After returning home, the representatives not only described the scenery on the beautiful and fertile islands of Indonesia, but also introduced the efforts of the hardworking and wise Indonesian people to strive for complete national independence and defend Asian and world peace, thus enhancing the Chinese people's understanding and respect for the Indonesian people. All of this proves that the friendly mutual visits of the representatives of the two countries have comprehensively conveyed the friendship between our two peoples and strengthened the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, when we are once again delighted to welcome Dr. Mohammad Hatta, a distinguished guest from our friendly neighbor Indonesia, we do not feel that we are welcoming a stranger.
    Our Chinese people know that for the independence of Indonesia, Dr. Mohammad Hatta engaged in a long-term struggle before the Republic of Indonesia declared its independence, and was arrested by the Dutch colonial government. What is even better known to the Chinese people is that Dr. Mohammad Hatta and President Sukarno jointly signed the Declaration of Independence twelve years ago, announcing the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia.
    The Chinese and Indonesian people have both suffered long-term oppression, exploitation, and enslavement by imperialism. We have a common destiny and many of the same aspirations. Therefore, our people understand the value of this friendship, cherish this friendship, and strive for its increasing consolidation and continuous development. In the past years of arduous struggle, our two peoples have supported and encouraged each other in spirit. When both of our countries gained independence, our two peoples were also encouraged by this and built their own countries with great patriotic enthusiasm. Due to economic backwardness, our two countries also have something in common. In the construction of their respective countries, our two countries feel the need to support, assist, and learn from each other. In order to build our motherland, we must have a peaceful environment. Therefore, in the struggle to defend peace, the interests of our two peoples are also consistent. It is precisely because of these commonalities that the friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation between our two peoples have been further promoted.
    On August 1 this year, Dr. Mohammad Hatta told reporters from the Indonesian News Agency that this visit to China will focus on studying China's industrial and agricultural construction and the agricultural collectivization movement. We know that after Indonesia's independence, Dr. Mohammad Hatta paid great attention to Indonesia's economic construction, especially the construction of cooperatives. We believe that this visit by Dr. Mohammad Hatta to our country will surely provide us with valuable opinions in the mutual exchange of views. We firmly believe that Dr. Mohammad Hatta's visit to China will further promote the friendship and mutual understanding between the two peoples. I wish Dr. Mohammad Hatta a pleasant stay in our country in an atmosphere of friendship, and wish him and his wife good health and the further strengthening of the eternal friendship between the two peoples.

    欢迎穆罕默德·哈达博士
    中国印度尼西亚友好协会会长  包尔汉
    应我国周恩来总理的邀请前来我国访问的穆罕默德·哈达博士，定于9月22日到达北京。我们对于远道而来的贵宾表示热烈的欢迎。几年来，我们曾不止一次地在我们解放了的土地上热烈地欢迎来自印度尼西亚的朋友们，其中包括卓越的艺术歌舞团、杰出的作曲家、学者以及政府、议会、军事、和平、工会、青年、妇女等各方面著名的人士，而最令人难忘的是去年我们曾以极为兴奋的心情欢迎印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统。中国人民也曾不止一次地派遣自己的代表去访问邻邦印度尼西亚共和国。代表们回国以后，不仅描述了印度尼西亚的秀丽而丰饶的岛屿上的风光，而且介绍了勤劳智慧的印度尼西亚人民为争取国家的完全独立和保卫亚洲及世界和平所作的努力，因而增进了中国人民对印度尼西亚人民的了解和尊敬。这些都证明了两国代表亲切的相互访问，已经全面地互相传达了我们两国人民的友谊，并加强了两国的经济、文化合作关系。因此，当我们今天又一次高兴地欢迎来自友好的邻邦印度尼西亚的贵宾穆罕默德·哈达博士时，我们并不觉得在欢迎一个陌生的人。
    我们中国人民知道，为了印度尼西亚的独立，穆罕默德·哈达博士在印度尼西亚共和国宣布独立前，曾进行了长期的斗争，并曾被荷兰殖民政府逮捕过。更为中国人民所周知的，是在十二年前穆罕默德·哈达博士曾和苏加诺总统共同签署了独立宣言，宣布了印度尼西亚共和国的成立。
    中国和印度尼西亚人民都曾遭受过帝国主义长期的压迫、剥削和奴役。我们有着共同的命运，有着许多相同的愿望，因此，我国人民懂得这种友谊的珍贵，热爱这种友谊并为它的日益巩固和不断的发展而努力。在过去艰苦斗争的年代里，在精神上，我们两国人民是相互支持与鼓舞着的。当我们两国都获得了独立，我们两国人民也都为此欢欣鼓舞，并以高度的爱国热情来建设自己的国家。由于经济上的落后，我们两国也有其共同点，在建设各自国家中，我们两国都感到有相互支持、援助与相互学习的必要。为了建设自己的祖国，我们要有一个和平的环境，因此在保卫和平的斗争中，我们两国人民的利益也是一致的。正因为存在着这些共同点，就更加促进了我们两国人民之间的友谊、相互了解和合作。
    今年8月1日，穆罕默德·哈达博士对印度尼西亚新闻社记者说：这次到中国访问，将着重研究中国的工农业建设和农业合作化运动的情况。我们知道穆罕默德·哈达博士在印度尼西亚独立后非常注意印度尼西亚的经济建设，特别是合作社的建设问题。我们相信，这次穆罕默德·哈达博士到我国访问，在相互交换意见中，一定会给我们提出宝贵的意见。我们深信穆罕默德·哈达博士这次访问中国，一定会进一步促进两国人民的友谊和相互了解。我预祝穆罕默德·哈达博士在我们祖国的友谊的气氛中度过愉快的日子，预祝他和夫人的身体健康和两国人民之间永恒友谊的更加增强。
