China Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation
Uncovers a Rightist Clique

(Reported by our newspaper) The employees of the China Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation recently exposed a rightist clique. The leading figures of the small clique were Yi Hong, Deputy Director of the Shipping Department, Zhao Yumin (a Party member), Deputy Director of the Chartering Department, and Wang Yuxiang, a first-class clerk of the Secretariat.

Yi Hong, who joined the Party in 1936 and boasted of having "old revolutionary qualifications," had never reformed his exploitative class ideology over a long period. After entering the city, he degenerated and became corrupt. During the "Three-Anti" campaign in 1952, he was found to have engaged in serious embezzlement and bribery, was expelled from the Party, removed from his post, and sentenced by the court to one year of supervised control by the authorities. From then on, he harbored resentment and hatred towards the Party. He colluded with the rightist Wang Yuxiang, often "talking heart-to-heart over drinks" and praising each other.

When the company started the rectification campaign, they shot poisoned arrows at the Party, writing a manuscript called "Spring Comes, But Flowers Do Not Bloom," criticizing the company leadership for not putting enough effort into the rectification.

On the evening of May 18, Yi Hong and Wang Yuxiang summoned seven members of the small clique to Wang Yuxiang's home for a meeting. Yi Hong incited them, saying that the company's Party branch was a mess, plagued by serious sectarianism, and full of unspeakable scandals, and that several people had to be purged this time. He also instructed everyone that the spearhead of their attack should be directed at the company leadership and the personnel system. At the meeting, they also analyzed who could be developed into their targets. This gathering was a mobilization meeting for this small clique to attack the Party. Afterwards, the members of this clique often gathered late at night to plan methods for attacking the Party.

This gang of rightists also formulated and implemented the following "mass line" - relying on those "with a sense of justice" (i.e., those who had been struggled against during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns and who were dissatisfied with the Party), striving to win over those who sought personal gain, dividing and suppressing members of the Communist Youth League and activists, and attacking Party members. They incited people who had been investigated during the "Three-Anti" and "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" campaigns to overturn their verdicts. Wang Yuxiang said to someone: "You have opinions about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, why don't you write a big-character poster?" Yi Hong almost completely stopped working for a period, focusing solely on talking to people. Members of the small clique often talked at Yi Hong's home until late at night before dispersing. They also adopted a tactic of attacking first and then trying to win over, attacking members of the Communist Youth League and activists. They cursed the members of the Communist Youth League in big-character posters as "sycophants" and "thugs." Yi Hong wrote a letter to the youth – "Naive Ignorance," viciously attacking the youth, saying that the character of today's youth is "a serious face, a cold heart, a blindly obedient head, and hands that persecute people." Why are these young people like this? He believed that it was the result of the Communist Party's sectarian attitude in cultivating them. He called on the youth to rise up against the leadership of the Communist Party.

The main spearhead of the rightist clique's attack on the Party was directed at the company leadership and the personnel system. They took the lead in cursing the company leadership on the blackboard newspaper. Wang Yuxiang completely negated the company's achievements over the past few years, saying that every director of the company was either incompetent or unable to do anything. They cursed the personnel department as being like the old police station, specializing in cultivating "slaves." When everyone nominated candidates for the trade union committee, he clamored not to nominate Communist Party members, but to nominate people "with a sense of justice." When some comrades disagreed with his views, he said with a red face and a thick neck: "The trade union constitution does not stipulate that there must be Party members on the trade union committee!"

Zhao Yumin, Deputy Director of the Chartering Department, was the strategist of the rightist clique in attacking the Party. He completely lost the position of a Communist Party member and supported the rightist elements in the Party in attacking the Party. He openly defended the rightists at the branch meeting, believing that Yi Hong's mistakes were merely "individual heroism and a lack of understanding of the spirit of rectification," and not that he was a rightist. After the company shifted to counterattacking the rightists, Zhao repeatedly obstructed the development of the anti-rightist struggle. He also instructed the rightists: "Be calm, don't rush, two weeks will pass."

All employees of the transportation company are currently fully engaged in the struggle to encircle and annihilate the rightist clique. After nearly two months of exposing facts and reasoning, the rightist clique has begun to disintegrate.

    中国对外贸易运输公司
    揭发出一个右派小集团
    本报讯　中国对外贸易运输公司职工，最近揭露出一个右派小集团。小集团的首脑人物是海运处副处长伊洪、租船处副处长赵裕民（党员）、秘书处一等科员王玉祥。
    伊洪这个1936年就加入了党、自吹有“革命老资格”的人，长期以来他的剥削阶级的思想意识一直未得改造。进城以后，蜕化变质，堕落腐化。1952年“三反”时，因查出他有严重的贪污受贿行为，被开除党籍，并给予撤职、法院判处机关管制一年的处分。从此，他就怀恨和仇视党，他和右派分子王玉祥勾结在一起，经常“借酒谈心”，互相吹捧。
    公司开始整风他们就向党放出毒箭，写了“春来花不开”一稿，批评公司领导整风的劲头不大。
    5月18日晚，伊洪、王玉祥就召集小集团成员七人在王玉祥家开会，伊洪就鼓动说公司的党支部是一团糟，宗派主义严重，有许多不可告人的丑事，这次非整掉几个不可。他还指示大家：进攻的锋芒要指向公司领导和人事制度。在会上，他们还分析了那些人可以作为他们的发展对象。这次集会，是这撮小集团向党进攻的誓师大会。以后，这个集团的成员经常在深夜集会，策划向党进攻的方法。
    这伙右派分子还制定和执行了如下的“群众路线”——依靠“有正义感的”（即“三反”“肃反”中被斗过、对党不满的人），争取闹个人名利的，分化和压制团员和积极分子，打击党员。他们到处鼓动“三反”、“肃反”中被审查过的人起来翻案。王玉祥对某人说： “你对肃反有意见，为什么不写大字报呀？”伊洪有一时期几乎是不工作，专门找人谈话。小集团的成员们常到伊洪家谈至深夜方散。他们又采取先打后拉的手法，打击共青团员和积极分子。他们在大字报上骂共青团员是“拍马屁的、”是“打手”。伊洪写了一封告青年书——“天真的愚昧”，恶毒地攻击青年，说现在青年的性格是“严肃的脸，冷酷的心，盲从的头，整人的手”。这些青年为什么会这样呢？他认为是共产党用宗派主义态度培养的结果。他号召青年们起来反对共产党的领导。
    右派小集团向党进攻的主要锋芒，是指向公司领导和人事制度。他们带头在黑板报上谩骂公司领导。王玉祥全盘否定公司几年来的工作成绩，说公司的每个处长都是不干事或干不了事的。他们骂人事处像过去的派出所，专门培养“奴才”。当大家提工会委员候选人时，他叫嚣不要提共产党员，要提“有正义感”的人”。有些同志不同意他的看法，他就脸红脖子粗地说：“工会章程里没有规定工会委员里一定非有党员不可呀！”
    租船处副处长赵裕民是右派小集团向党进攻的军师。他完全失掉了一个共产党员的立场，在党内支持右派分子向党进攻。他在支部大会上公开为右派分子辩护，认为伊洪的错误仅仅是“个人英雄主义，对整风的精神领会不够。”不是右派分子。公司转入反击右派后，赵又百般阻挠反右派斗争的开展。他还指示右派分子说：“要沉着气，不要着急，有二星期就过去了。”
    运输公司全体职工，目前正全力投入围歼右派小集团的斗争中。经过近两个月来的揭露事实，说理斗争，右派小集团已开始瓦解。
