Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held its Employee Representative Assembly yesterday and today. The main characteristics of this assembly are: the employees expressed great satisfaction with the problems solved by the Communist Party organization since the rectification campaign, and they have great confidence in resolving the contradictions within the enterprise through rectification.

The factory's Party Committee Secretary, Zhang Ping, gave a report on the factory's rectification situation at the meeting. In his report, Zhang Ping said that since the factory began its rectification on August 3rd, employees have submitted more than ten thousand suggestions through more than four thousand big-character posters and through trade union group meetings and technical personnel symposiums. The vast majority of these suggestions are correct and well-intentioned. Among these suggestions, more than two thousand six hundred have been adopted and used to improve work, or are being actively worked on to improve work. For example, after the method of "flat laying and cutting" of ore was implemented in transportation in 1952, workers had to carry sixty kilograms of ore up a forty-degree slope, resulting in a very heavy workload. The dispute over changing "flat laying" to "vertical laying" has been a long-standing issue of contention between transportation, iron smelting, and technical supervision. During the rectification period, the factory leadership and relevant parties conducted investigations and research, and changed "flat laying" to "vertical laying" using machinery, solving this problem. Some problems were solved shortly after the big-character posters were posted. For example, on August 24th, Loading and Unloading Area 3 posted a big-character poster written by worker Xiong Shugui: "The road from Xiaobeimen to the cement cave is difficult to walk during work hours, and even more difficult to walk on rainy nights. I hope the leadership will solve this problem, and not lock the stable door after the horse is stolen." On August 27th, leading cadres led some cadres to repair a small road on this road and installed five electric lights. The workers said, "The big-character posters really work. The road was repaired and the lights were installed as soon as it was suggested."

Zhang Ping said that during the rectification, factory and workshop leading cadres also established and maintained a system of spending twelve hours a week in the workshops, and established and maintained a system of participating in physical labor once every two weeks. In the course of labor, some cadres promptly solved problems in production due to a deeper understanding of the situation. Cui Xiaoqing, the equipment assistant director of the Iron Smelting Department, personally felt the impact of the sluggish rotation of iron cars on his work during physical labor, and immediately organized forces to carry out emergency repairs. When cadres from the Transportation Department unloaded Ximing coal, they learned about the impact of excessive coal dust on workers' health and agreed to the method of spraying water. The Party General Branch of the Coking and Office Production System vacated offices and solved the problem of rest rooms for workers. In the past, the single dormitory of the quarry accommodated twenty people in a large room, which made it difficult to rest. During the rectification, waste materials were used to convert it into small rooms for five people each.

Zhang Ping said that the Party Committee generally handled the various issues raised by employees based on the following three principles: First, implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift. Try to solve problems that urgently need to be solved in production and life with little or no money. Second, pool the wisdom and efforts of everyone, and take the method of combining leadership and the masses to rely on the enthusiasm of the masses to solve problems. We have many problems that cannot be solved solely by relying on the strength of the state, but also by relying on the strength of the masses and the collective. Third, take overall consideration and make reasonable arrangements. When solving problems, we must first proceed from the overall situation of all employees in the factory, and at the same time take into account the specific interests of employees in various departments and aspects.

The more than two thousand six hundred suggestions mentioned by Zhang Ping in his report, along with the handling methods, have been compiled into a book and distributed to all representatives.

Zhang Ping said in his report that some suggestions are due to the comrades who made the suggestions not understanding the situation well enough and having misunderstandings about the judgment of the problems, which require explaining the actual situation. For example, some workers in the original steam locomotive workshop believed that twelve of the thirteen group leaders and foremen in the workshop were Party members, and mistakenly believed that the Party only promoted Party members, which was a manifestation of sectarianism. In fact, eight of the Party members who are now group leaders were group leaders before joining the Party, and only four were promoted from Party member workers. Moreover, in terms of technology and ability, these four people are also qualified. This is not the result of sectarianism. In addition, some suggestions need to be further studied.

At today's conference, the representatives unanimously agreed with Zhang Ping's report and believed that the Party Committee had conscientiously implemented the spirit of rectification while correcting. Many representatives spoke with great excitement, believing that fully developing socialist democracy among employees through open airing of views and rectification while correcting is a good form. During the period of open airing of views, the factory's production order was completely normal. The young blast furnace workers alone overproduced more than 330 tons of pig iron in thirteen days, which shows the working class's spirit of organization, discipline, and adherence to democratic centralism during the rectification period.

Many representatives also used specific facts about rectification while correcting to supplement Zhang Ping's report, explaining that the handling of these more than two thousand suggestions solved some contradictions between the Party and the masses, between leaders and the led, and in production management. Coal washing worker Li Xinyue said that he had made suggestions for improvement on the problem of affecting coal washing quality a long time ago, but no one had responded. This time, he posted a big-character poster, and the workshop director immediately exchanged opinions on improvement with him, and the problem can be solved soon. In the past, the director of this workshop rarely went to the site when the weather was good, but now this style has changed. Too much slag accumulated next to the small blast furnace, and the workers called it "Erlang Mountain," which hindered production work. In the past, the workers had made several suggestions to the workshop director, but they were not resolved. This time, the rectification also "rectified" "Erlang Mountain."

The entire plant has now begun to enter a climax of improving work.

### 石景山钢铁厂职工代表大会拥护边整边改  通过整风解决矛盾信心百倍  两千多条意见已经采纳　全厂进入改进工作高潮

    石景山钢铁厂职工代表大会拥护边整边改
    通过整风解决矛盾信心百倍
    两千多条意见已经采纳　全厂进入改进工作高潮
    新华社8日讯　石景山钢铁厂昨天和今天举行了职工代表大会。这次大会主要的特点是：职工们对整风以来共产党组织解决的问题表示很满意，对于通过整风解决企业内的矛盾的信心很高。
    这个厂的党委书记张萍在会上作了工厂整风情况的报告。张萍在报告中说，工厂从8月3日整风以来，职工们用四千多张大字报和通过工会小组会、技职人员座谈会的形式，共提出了一万多条意见，这些意见绝大部分是正确的，是善意的。这些意见中，有两千六百多条已经采纳并据以改进了工作或正在积极设法改进工作。例如运输方面从1952年推行矿石“平铺切装”的方法后，工人要背六十公斤矿石，走四十度坡，劳动负荷量很重。这个“平铺”改“立铺”之争，长年来一直是运输、炼铁和技术监督方面争执不决的老问题。整风期间，厂部和有关方面进行了调查研究，将“平铺”利用机械改为“立铺”，解决了这一问题。有些在大字报刚贴不久，问题就得到解决。如8月24日装卸三区贴出工人熊舒贵的一张大字报上写的：“小北门到洋灰洞的道，上下班不好走，下雨晚上更难走，希望领导解决，不要贼走了再关门”。8月27日领导干部便带领了一些干部在这条道上修了一条小马路，按了五个电灯，工人说： “还是大字报起作用，刚提出来道就修好了，灯也安上了”。
    张萍说，整风中厂和车间的领导干部还建立和坚持了每周十二小时下车间的制度，建立和坚持了每两周参加一次体力劳动的制度。在劳动中，有些干部由于深入了解了情况，因此及时解决了生产中的问题。炼铁部设备助理主任崔孝庆参加体力劳动中亲身感到铁车转动不灵对工作的影响后，立即组织力量进行了抢修。运输部干部卸西铭煤时，了解到煤尘太大对工人身体的影响，同意了打水的办法。炼焦和办公厅生产系统的党总支，把办公室让出来，给工人解决了休息室的问题。采石场的单身宿舍，以前二十人住一大间，休息不好，整风中利用废料改成了五人一间的小房间。
    张萍说，党委在处理职工提出的各种问题时，一般是根据下面三项原则办事的，即：一、贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和勤俭办一切事业的方针。尽量在不花钱或花钱不多的条件下，解决生产上和生活上迫切需要解决的问题。二、群策群力，大家动手，采取领导和群众相结合的办法，依靠群众的积极性解决问题。我们有很多问题，不能仅仅依靠国家的力量，而且还要依靠群众和集体的力量来解决。三、统筹兼顾，合理安排。解决问题时，首先要从全厂职工的整体情况出发，同时要照顾到各个部门和各个方面职工的具体利益。
    张萍在报告中所提到的这二千六百多条意见，连同处理办法，都逐条汇编成册，发给了所有代表。
    张萍在报告中说，还有一部分意见，是由于提意见的同志对情况了解不够，对问题的判断上有误解，需要说明实际情况的。如原蒸汽车间有的工人认为车间里十三个组长、工长中有十二个是党员，就误认为党只提拔党员，是宗派主义的一种表现。实际上现在担任组长的党员，其中有八人在入党以前即已担任了组长的职务，只有四人是由党员工人中提升的，而且按技术和能力来讲这四个人也是称职的。这并不是宗派主义的结果。另外有些意见，需进一步进行研究。
    在今天举行的大会上，代表们一致同意张萍的报告，认为党委认真贯彻了边整边改的精神。很多代表在发言中，都十分兴奋，认为大鸣大放、边整边改，是在职工中充分发扬社会主义民主的一种良好的形式。在大鸣大放期间，工厂生产秩序完全正常，仅青年高炉工人在十三天内就超产了三百三十多吨生铁，这说明工人阶级在整风期间表现的组织性、纪律性和遵守民主集中制的精神。
    很多代表还用有关边整边改的具体事实补充了张萍的报告，说明这两千多条意见的处理，解决了党和群众之间、领导与被领导之间、以及生产管理方面的一些矛盾。洗煤工人李新月说，他很早以前就对影响洗煤质量的问题提出了改进意见，但是一直没有人答复。这次他贴出了一张大字报，车间主任马上就找他交换改进的意见，最近就可以解决问题。这个车间的主任过去在天气好的时候也很少到现场，现在这种作风转变了。小高炉旁边的炉渣堆积太多，工人们都称它是“二郎山”，妨碍生产工作。过去工人们对车间主任提了几次意见也没有解决，这次整风把“二郎山”也“整掉”了。
    现在全厂已开始进入改进工作的高潮。
