The Serious Political Task of the September 3rd Society
Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the September 3rd Society, Tu Changwang

As a democratic party in New China, the September 3rd Society should be a faithful and powerful assistant to the Chinese Communist Party. However, during the period of helping the Party with rectification, it not only failed to be the Party's assistant but, on the contrary, became a "hitman" attacking the Party. The problem of the September 3rd Society is very serious, and it is undergoing a severe historical test.

From the materials revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle over the past two months: First, the national organizations of our society at all levels have exposed a large number of Rightists. For example, Chu Anping, Gu Zhizhong, and Xue Yu in Beijing; Chen Shiwei in Lanzhou; Lu Kanru in Qingdao; Gao Juefu and Zhou Shilu in Nanjing; Qin Zan in Kunming, etc. These people were all serving as the main generals or big and small leaders in the local areas or in a unit, launching frantic attacks on the Party. Second, in the past two years, the anti-socialist "great development" policy has been implemented, emphasizing only development and neglecting consolidation, blindly pursuing quantity. Many politically complex elements have also been drawn into the "September 3rd Society." Among the fifteen Rightists in the Wuhan branch, ten were new members; the Taiyuan branch preparatory committee, newly established last year, had eighteen Rightists among its eighty-odd members. Many local organizations and grassroots organizations were controlled by Rightists, forming anti-Party and anti-socialist cliques. Third, in recent years, the central committee of the society has been indifferent to major political issues, especially the ideological remolding of intellectuals, emphasizing only unity and neglecting education, abandoning the ideological remolding work of its members, resulting in the rise of Rightists in many organizations. From this, it can be seen that the political direction and organizational line of our society have been Right-leaning for more than a year, and the composition of the society is gradually undergoing qualitative changes. Some people ask, "What kind of political party is the September 3rd Society, and where is it going?" This question is very good and very timely, and the central committee and the broad masses of members should face up to and answer this question. The central committee feels deeply ashamed of the Party and the people of the whole country. With a heavy and guilty conscience, we are determined to thoroughly examine the work of the central committee over the past two years.

Since liberation, under the training of the Party and government at all levels in state organs, and through the practical exercise of political study and successive great political movements, the awareness of our society members has been raised, and they are eagerly hoping that the organization will help them gradually transform themselves into intellectuals of the working people. However, very ashamed, the central committee of the society has not done enough to promote and help members to transform themselves, and has not been able to meet the requirements of the broad masses of members. On the contrary, in the past year or two, some people have attempted to lead our society in the wrong political direction of bourgeois Right-leaning, which we are deeply saddened and pained by. The emergence of these problems is not accidental. As far as the members of the September 3rd Society are concerned, most of them are from petty-bourgeois or bourgeois backgrounds, have been educated in the bourgeoisie for a long time, and are essentially bourgeois intellectuals; the original name of the September 3rd Society was "Democracy and Science Society," which was organized and established in the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan to promote the spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement of striving for democracy and science. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to "oppose dictatorship and oppose civil war," it worked with various democratic parties and democrats to do some anti-American and anti-Chiang things that were beneficial to the people's revolution, but the September 3rd Society itself did not have a clear political program and goals; therefore, in terms of its political direction, organizational composition, and ideological system, it is a petty-bourgeois political party. After liberation, under the care and cultivation of the Party and the people, our society was gloriously listed as one of the democratic parties and participated in the CPPCC, and only then did it have a great political future. However, due to the poor political work of our society in the past few years, it has not undergone major political training and tests, and its bourgeois nature has basically remained intact or moved very little. It is impossible for a political party of a bourgeois nature to serve socialism. The fact that a large number of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist Rightists have been exposed in this great rectification process fully illustrates this point.

To carry out the essential transformation from a bourgeois political party to a socialist political party is a serious political task facing us. I think the urgent task at present is to unswervingly unfold the anti-Rightist struggle in depth and universally in all levels of organizations across the country under the leadership of the Party with a determination like steel, overcoming all sentimentalism. The Fifth Meeting of the Rectification Work Committee of our Society's Central Committee has decided to convene a national rectification work conference to further clarify the direction and tasks of the anti-Rightist struggle, unify understanding, exchange experience, and actively and step by step deepen this struggle to all grassroots organizations. Only through this sharp political struggle can the organizations of our society at all levels create favorable conditions for fundamental transformation, reverse the past wrong political direction, regain political vitality, win the trust of the people, and play a positive role in the political life of the country.

Secondly, on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, our society must resolutely implement the promotion and help of members to carry out ideological remolding that will result in a complete change. This is to carry out the education of "breaking the capitalist stand and establishing the socialist stand" according to the six criteria for judging right and wrong indicated by Chairman Mao, and to complete the fundamental self-transformation. The members of our society are mostly middle and upper-level intellectuals in the scientific, cultural, and educational circles. Their old democratic and free ideas are very serious, and their bourgeois habits are quite strong. In particular, a large part of the members of the society are natural scientists. Many of them are not familiar with Marxism-Leninism, but they think that natural science itself is materialistic, so they one-sidedly emphasize ideological remolding through work practice, neglecting or relaxing the study of Marxism-Leninism and self-education; a few people even think that they have mastered the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism and do not need ideological remolding; and a few people, although ideologically and verbally admit that the Party can lead science, but when they come into contact with the specific business of their posts, they one-sidedly emphasize that "laymen cannot lead experts," and unconsciously negate the leadership of the Party. The fact that many Rightists in our society are natural scientists is enough to prove how urgently ideological remolding is needed for natural scientists!

We thank the Party for sounding the alarm for us, and thank many friends in society and the broad masses of members of our society for giving us timely help and supervision. Under the leadership and help of the Party, and with the efforts and supervision of all members, we have the confidence and determination to win a complete victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, so as to transform the September 3rd Society into a political force that truly serves socialism, coexists with the Communist Party for a long time, and supervises each other to meet the needs of the new society.

### 九三学社的严重政治任务

    九三学社的严重政治任务
    九三学社中央委员会秘书长　涂长望
    九三学社作为新中国的一个民主党派，应该是忠实于中国共产党的有力助手，但是，就在帮助党整风期间，它非但不是党的助手，相反的，却成了进攻党的“打手”。九三学社的问题非常严重，它正在经历着历史的严重考验。
    从两个多月来反右派斗争所揭发的材料来看：第一，我社全国各级组织已经揭露出大批右派分子。例如北京的储安平、顾执中、薛愚；兰州的陈时伟；青岛的陆侃如；南京的高觉敷、周拾禄；昆明的秦瓒等等。这些人都是在地方上或者在一个单位中充当了向党猖狂进攻的主帅或大小头目。第二，近两年来执行反社会主义的“大发展”方针，只强调发展，不注意巩固，一味追求数量，许多政治上复杂的分子也被拉进了“九三”。武汉分社的十五个右派分子中，就有十一个是新社员；去年新建立的太原分社筹委会，八十几个社员中就有十八个是右派分子。不少地方组织和基层组织为右派分子所控制，形成了反党反社会主义的小集团。第三，近年来社中央对重大政治问题，特别是知识分子的思想改造问题，漠不关心，只团结，不教育，放弃了社员的思想改造工作，致使右派分子在许多组织中得势。由此看来，我社一年多来的政治方向和组织路线已经右倾，社的成分正在逐渐起着质的变化，有人问“九三学社到底是一个什么样的政党，要到那里去？”这个问题问得非常好，非常及时，社中央和广大社员应该正视和解答这一问题。社中央深感愧对党和全国人民，我们怀着沉痛的负罪的心情，决心彻底地检查中央两年来的工作。
    解放以来，我社社员在国家各级机关的党政培养下，通过政治学习和历次伟大政治运动的实际锻炼，觉悟提高，因而迫切希望组织帮助他们，把他们逐步改造成为劳动人民的知识分子。但是非常惭愧，社中央对推动和帮助社员自我改造的工作，做的很不够，没有能够满足广大社员的要求。相反的，最近一两年来，有人却企图把我社引向资产阶级右倾的错误政治方向，这是为我们所疾首痛心的。这些问题的产生并不是偶然的。就九三学社的成员来说，多是小资产阶级或资产阶级出身，长期受过资产阶级的教育，本质上是资产阶级知识分子；九三学社原名“民主科学社”，是在抗日战争后期，为发扬“五四”为民主与科学奋斗的精神而组织成立的。抗战胜利以后，在中国共产党的“反对独裁、反对内战”的号召和领导下，和各民主党派及民主人士一道，做了一些反美反蒋有益于人民革命的工作，而九三学社本身并没有明确的政治主张和奋斗目标；因此，就它的政治方向、组织成分、思想体系看来，它是一个小资产阶级性质的政党。解放以后，在党和人民的爱护与培养下，我社光荣地被列为民主党派之一，参加了人民政协，才算有了伟大的政治前途。但是由于几年来我社的政治工作做的很差，没有经过重大的政治锻炼和考验，它的资产阶级的性质基本上还原封未动或动的很少。一个资产阶级性质的政党要为社会主义服务是不可能的。在这次伟大的整风过程中，揭发出大批反党反人民反社会主义的右派分子这一事实，充分说明了这一点。
    进行由资产阶级政党到社会主义政党的本质上的改造，这就是摆在我们面前的一项严重政治任务。我认为目前的迫切任务，就是要坚定不移地在党的领导下，下定钢铁般的决心，克服一切温情主义，领导全国各级组织深入普遍地展开反右派斗争。我社中央整风工作委员会第五次会议已经决定召开全国整风工作会议，进一步明确反右派斗争的方针任务，统一认识，交流经验，积极地和有步骤地把这一斗争深入到一切基层组织去。只有通过这场尖锐的政治斗争，我社各级组织才有可能为进行根本改造创造有利条件，才有可能扭转过去的错误政治方向，重新获得政治生机，争取人民的信任，在国家政治生活中发挥它应起的积极作用。
    其次，我社要在反右派斗争的胜利基础上，坚决贯彻推动和帮助社员进行脱胎换骨的思想改造。这就是要按照毛主席指示的判别是非的六条标准，进行“破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场”的教育，完成根本的自我改造。我社社员大都是科学文教界的中上层知识分子，他们的旧民主自由思想非常严重，资产阶级习惯作风相当浓厚，特别是社成员中很大一部分是自然科学工作者，他们中有不少人对马克思列宁主义本来就不熟悉，可是又自以为自然科学本身就是唯物的，因而片面地强调通过工作实践进行思想改造，忽视或放松了马克思列宁主义的学习和自我教育；少数人甚至认为自己已经掌握了马克思列宁主义的科学方法，用不着思想改造了；也有少数人虽然在思想上和口头上承认党能领导科学，但一接触到本岗位具体业务，就片面强调“外行不能领导内行”，不自觉地又否定了党的领导。我社许多右派分子都是自然科学工作者的事实，足以证明自然科学工作者的思想改造是何等迫切需要！
    我们感谢党对我们敲起了警钟，感谢社会上的很多朋友和我社广大社员给我们及时的帮助和监督。在党的领导和帮助下，在全体社员的努力和督促下，我们有信心有决心取得反右派斗争的完全胜利，从而把九三学社改造成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，和共产党长期共存，互相监督，以适应新社会的需要。
