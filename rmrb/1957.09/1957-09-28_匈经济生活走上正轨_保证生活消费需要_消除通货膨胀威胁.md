Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 27th: Hungarian Finance Minister Antos Istvan said at a meeting of the National Assembly's Planning and Budget Committee on the 25th that Hungary's economic recovery this year has been better than expected. According to the planned national economic income for the first half of the year, there is a surplus of 1,158.8 million forints (Hungarian currency) after expenses.

Antos said that industrial production in the second quarter of this year had reached 93% of the same period last year, and industrial production in August was equivalent to 101% of the average monthly production in the first three quarters of last year. Therefore, the country was able to guarantee the residents' need for consumer goods under difficult circumstances and eliminated the threat of inflation. Although the prices of some commodities have been raised in order to maintain the balance between supply and demand, the prices of daily necessities have not been raised.

Antos said that agricultural production was also higher than planned. For example, grain production was 76,000 metric tons more than expected. He said that all this shows that economic life has returned to normal. Today, it can be said with certainty that we have overcome the indirect impact of the economic losses caused by the counter-revolutionary events. Antos also talked about some negative phenomena and shortcomings in the national economic recovery, such as high production costs, excessively high wages in some places, inadequate arrangements for construction projects, imports exceeding exports, and speculation on the market.

    匈经济生活走上正轨
    保证生活消费需要　消除通货膨胀威胁
    据新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利财政部长安托什·伊斯特万25日在国民议会计划预算委员会会议上说，今年匈牙利的经济恢复情况比预料的为好。按上半年预定的国民经济收入来说，除去支出以外，尚多余十一亿五千八百万福林（匈币）。
    安托什说，今年第二季度工业生产已经达到去年同期的93％，8月份的工业生产相当于去年头三季度平均每月生产量的101％。因此，国家能够在困难的情况下，保证了居民对消费品的需要，并且消除了通货膨胀的威胁。虽然为了保持供求之间的平衡，提高了某些商品的价格，但是日常生活必需品的价格并未提高。
    安托什说，农业生产也比计划生产的为多。例如，粮食比预计的多生产了七万六千公担。他说，这一切都说明经济生活已经走入正轨。今天已经能够肯定地说，我们已经克服了反革命事件所引起的经济损失的间接影响。安托什还谈到了国民经济恢复工作中的一些消极现象和缺点，如生产成本高、某些地方工资过高、建筑工程的安排不够恰当、进口超过出口、市场上有人投机倒把等。
