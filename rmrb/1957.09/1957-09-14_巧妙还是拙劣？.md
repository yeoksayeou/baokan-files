Clever or Clumsy?
　　Huang Zhi

　　Lu Yi, a rightist element from the Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (Shanghai News Daily), once gleefully used the lion reporting issue to fiercely attack the Party and the state's confidentiality work. Now the truth about the "lion confidentiality" issue has come to light.

　　If the facts were really as Lu Yi "exposed," that the arrival of a new lion at the park was not allowed to be reported, and the six million citizens of Shanghai were not allowed to know, and reporters were not even allowed the freedom to photograph the lion, it would truly be outrageous! But is that really the case? The facts presented by the person in charge of the Shanghai Garden Administration completely exposed Lu Yi's lies.

　　We do not deny that when domestic and foreign enemies are constantly seeking opportunities to sabotage our construction endeavors, certain aspects of our construction and work must be kept confidential as necessary. However, there are some people who hold a completely different attitude towards the socialist cause than we do. They have always been dissatisfied with the state's appropriate maintenance of work secrets in the struggle against the enemy. They groundlessly exaggerate the shortcomings of confidentiality work, saying how bad it is, how it affects other work; some people try every means to portray the state's confidentiality system as opposed to the interests of the people, provoking mass dissatisfaction in order to achieve the goal of abolishing confidentiality work, leaving the state unprepared and wide open to the enemy.

　　Rightist elements are accustomed to distorting right and wrong, and calling black white. However, compared with other rumors, the lion confidentiality issue is even more shameless and vicious. They cleverly use events in people's lives to provoke, attempting to arouse more people's dissatisfaction. However, the rightist elements have wasted their efforts. After the people see through their conspiracy, it only reveals their clumsiness, ridiculousness, and despicable shamefulness!

　　巧妙还是拙劣？
　　黄植
    上海新闻日报的右派分子陆诒，曾经得意地利用狮子的报道问题来狠狠地攻击党和国家的保密工作。如今“狮子保密”问题已真象大白了。
    如果事实真如陆诒“揭露”的那样，公园里新来了一头狮子都不让登报，不让上海六百万市民知道，记者们连给狮子拍照的自由也没有，真正是岂有此理！但是事情果然是这样么？上海园林处负责人摆出的事实，却把陆诒的谎言完全揭穿了。
    我们并不否认，当国内外的敌人经常伺隙向我们的建设事业不断进行破坏的情况下，我们的某些建设和工作是要进行必要的保密的。然而，有那么一批人，他们对社会主义事业持有和我们完全不同的态度。他们一向不满意国家在敌我斗争中适当保持工作中的机密，他们毫无根据地夸大保密工作的缺点，说它怎样怎样不好，怎样怎样影响了别的工作；有的人就千方百计把国家的保密制度说成同人民利益是对立的，挑拨群众的不满，以达到取消保密工作让国家在敌人面前毫无戒备，门户洞开的目的。
    右派分子是惯于颠倒是非、将黑说白的。不过狮子保密问题和其他一些谣言比较起来，是更加无耻、更加毒辣的，他巧妙地通过人民生活中的事件来进行挑拨，企图激起更多人的不满。然而右派分子白费了心机，当人民把他们的阴谋拆穿之后，只更见其拙劣可笑与卑鄙可耻而已！
