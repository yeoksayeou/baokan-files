Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 28th. As a result of Tianjin's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the proportion of light and heavy industries has undergone a major change. Before liberation, heavy industry accounted for only 13%, now the proportion of light and heavy industries is roughly half each.

The level of industrial production in Tianjin has grown at an average annual rate of 27.19% since liberation. This year, the city's total industrial output value is expected to reach about eight times that of 1948 before liberation. The total value of the city's current industrial fixed assets is equivalent to six to seven times the accumulation of the eighty-two years before liberation.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, Tianjin provided the country with many first-class products, such as soda ash, caustic soda, "666" pesticide, bicycles, and Exchange brand floral fabric. It is estimated by relevant parties that there are now at least 20,000 types of industrial products in Tianjin. Many key factories and key construction projects across the country have received mechanical equipment or important mechanical parts supported by Tianjin.

The old industrial structure of Tianjin was thoroughly transformed during the First Five-Year Plan. In the past five years, the city has rebuilt and expanded hundreds of factories with small investments, tapping the production potential of existing factories; under the premise of fully utilizing existing equipment, the fixed assets used in industry have been continuously updated. Currently, the proportion of modern machine production in the city's total industrial output value has increased from 76.93% in 1949 to more than 90% this year. The result of the reconstruction and expansion has led to the emergence of many new industrial products in Tianjin, including cellophane, plastics, watches, and 1605 pesticide. In particular, the machinery industry has developed from a repair and fitting industry to a machine manufacturing industry due to reconstruction and expansion. The mechanical equipment produced by this industrial sector has increased from 54 types in 1952 to more than 800 types currently. Tianjin's original 224 scattered and backward electrical appliance factories could only produce some small electrical accessories or low-end products. After a large-scale economic reorganization in 1956, the equipment and technical force were adjusted, and now they can produce more than 200 types of electrical instruments such as ultrasonic flaw detectors, precision pulse testers, and electronic oscilloscopes, which can check whether there are sand holes, cracks, and other defects inside metal or non-metal materials up to five meters thick, becoming an important instrument industry sector in the country.

    天津轻重工业比重发生重大变化
    工业生产水平平均每年增长27％
    新华社天津28日电　天津市执行第一个五年计划的结果，轻重工业的比重已起重大变化。解放前重工业只占13％，现在轻重工业比重约各占一半。
    天津工业生产水平解放后平均每年增长27.19％，今年全市工业总产值，预计将达到解放前1948年的八倍左右。全市现在的工业固定资产总值已相当于解放前八十二年中积累起来的六倍到七倍。
    在第一个五年计划期间，天津为全国提供了纯碱、烧碱、“六六六”农药、自行车、交流牌花布等许多全国第一流的产品。现在天津市工业产品，据有关方面估计，至少有两万种。全国许多重点工厂和重点建设工程，都有天津支援的机械设备或重要的机械配件。
    天津市旧的工业结构，在第一个五年计划期间得到了彻底的改造。五年来，全市共以少量投资改建和扩建了几百个工厂，发挥了原有工厂的生产潜力；在充分运用原有设备的前提下，使工业用固定资产不断得到更新。现在，全市工业产值中使用现代机器生产的比重，已由1949年的76.93％提高到今年度的90％以上。改建扩建的结果，使许多新的工业产品在天津出现，其中有玻璃纸、塑料、手表、一六○五农药等。特别是机械工业，由于改建扩建，现在已由修配性的工业发展成为机器制造工业。这个工业部门生产的机械设备，已由1952年的五十四种，增加到目前的八百多种。天津市原有分散、落后的二百二十四户电器工厂，只能生产一些小型的电器配件或低级产品，经过1956年一次大规模的经济改组，调整了设备和技术力量以后，目前已能生产可以检查五公尺厚的金属或非金属内部有没有砂眼、裂痕等毛病的超声波探伤器、精密的脉冲检查器、电子示波器等二百多种电器仪表，成为全国重要的仪表工业部门。
