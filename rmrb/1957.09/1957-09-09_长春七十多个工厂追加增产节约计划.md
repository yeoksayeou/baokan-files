Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 8th: More than seventy light and heavy industrial factories in Changchun have comprehensively revised their production increase and savings plans.

These factories, having initially resolved the raw material issue and facing substantial market demand for their products, have decided to further increase production by a value of more than 5 million yuan for the state in the second half of the year.

In the first half of this year, these factories vigorously launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, promptly addressing the shortage of raw materials, and achieving relatively good results in completing various national economic indicators. Recently, after conducting a comprehensive review of the production increase and savings efforts in the first half of the year, these factories made comprehensive adjustments and revisions to their annual production increase plans.

In the revision process, special attention was paid to the close connection between production, supply, and sales, to ensure that the enterprises' potential is fully utilized and that increased production does not lead to stockpiling.
