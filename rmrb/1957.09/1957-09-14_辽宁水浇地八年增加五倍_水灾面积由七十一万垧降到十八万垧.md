　　Liaoning: Irrigated Land Increases Fivefold in Eight Years
　　Area of Floods Decreases from 710,000 Hectares to 180,000 Hectares
　　(By our newspaper) Liaoning Province has increased its irrigated farmland area fivefold in the past eight years, and the flood-stricken area has decreased by three-quarters. In the past eight years, Liaoning Province's investment in water conservancy construction (including the Dafang Reservoir) has reached over 160 million yuan. A total of more than 3,300 kilometers of dikes have been built or are being built on the Liao River, Hun River, Taizi River, Raoyang River, and Daling River, along with 53 drainage culverts. The massive project of rebuilding the Liao River dikes has also been underway for three years. While building river dikes, mass-based flood prevention and drainage projects have also been carried out in low-lying areas along the rivers. In 1956 alone, more than 10,000 new and ongoing farmland flood prevention projects and 233 drainage construction projects were completed. Soil and water conservation work has also been vigorously carried out in the mountainous areas upstream of various rivers.
　　Through the above series of measures, the province's flood-stricken area in 1956 has decreased from 710,000 hectares in 1949 to 180,000 hectares. With the development of water conservancy and the large increase in irrigated area, by 1956, the paddy field area had increased to 305,000 hectares, more than three times that of 1949, and the output had also increased six and a half times.

　　辽宁水浇地八年增加五倍
　　水灾面积由七十一万垧降到十八万垧
    本报讯  辽宁省八年来农田灌溉面积增加了五倍，水灾面积减少了四分之三。八年来，辽宁省投入的水利建设（包括大伙房水库）资金已达一亿六千多万元。在辽河、浑河、太子河、绕阳河、大凌河等河流上共建筑和正修筑的堤防全长达三千三百多公里，排水涵闸五十三座。辽河堤防改建的巨大工程亦已进行了三年。在修建河堤的同时，还在沿河低洼地区开展了群众性的防涝、排涝工程的修建，仅1956年完成新修和正修的农田防涝工程有一万多处，排水建筑工程二百三十三项。在各河上游的山地，还大力开展了水土保持工作。
    经过上述一系列措施，全省1956年水灾面积已由1949年的七十一万垧，降到十八万垧。随着水利建设发展，灌溉面积的大量增加，到1956年，稻田面积已增至三十万五千垧，比1949年增加三倍多，产量也增加了六倍半。
