Xinhua News Agency, 26th Dispatch: The First Ministry of Machine Building is implementing the spirit of rectifying while correcting. Many of its subordinate units have established special groups, drawing on a batch of cadres to sort, analyze, and study the opinions of the masses, and actively deal with them. According to preliminary statistics from thirty-eight enterprises, from May to the end of August, more than 550 opinions have been put forward, with a relatively large number concerning the working principles, policies, and leadership style of the ministry and bureaus. The leadership has decided that, apart from issues that must be resolved through mass debate or requests to higher authorities, any shortcomings and errors that can be corrected will be corrected immediately. For example, it has now been decided to gradually streamline the ministry and bureau organizations, reduce staffing levels, and abolish the Fourth Bureau. The nineteen old and new factories under this bureau will be placed under the leadership of the First and Third Bureaus respectively, with the official merger taking place in September. In the process of rectifying while correcting, the Supply Bureau has formulated measures for managing official documents, telegrams, and property, and has revised the attendance system. These measures and systems can be decided upon for implementation after discussion by the masses.

The ministry and its subordinate units have reviewed the salary adjustments and promotions of cadres last year and explained the situation to the masses. Individual instances of inappropriate promotions have been corrected or are being reviewed and corrected. Party member cadres who have been exposed for poor work styles, violations of laws and regulations during the blooming and contending period have also been dealt with according to the severity of their offenses.

Opinions regarding welfare have been basically addressed. For example, mass-based food committees have been established in all units. Twelve units have abolished small canteens and increased the supply of staple and non-staple foods. Some units have also established Hui Muslim canteens or tables. Many units have established housing management committees, conducted in-depth investigations into the actual housing situation, and made new allocations or adjustments for 266 households.

    接受群众意见努力改进工作
    第一机械部精简机构修订制度
    据新华社26日讯　第一机械工业部贯彻边整边改精神，所属许多单位都成立了专门小组，抽调一批干部对群众的意见加以排队、分析和研究，并积极地进行处理。据所属三十八个企业初步统计，从5月到8月底，已经提出五百五十多条意见，比较多的是对部和局工作方针政策及领导作风方面的意见。领导方面对于这些意见已决定除必须经过群众辩论或请示上级机关解决的问题以外，凡是能改正的缺点和错误马上就改。比如，现在已决定逐步精简部、局机构，紧缩编制，撤销四局，将这个局所属新老十九个厂，分别划归一局、三局领导，9月份正式合并。供应局在边整边改中拟订了公文管理、电报管理、财产管理等办法，并且修订了考勤制度。这些办法和制度经群众讨论后，即可决定实行。
    部和所属各单位对去年干部调整工资和提级的情况作了检查，并向群众作了说明，个别提拔不当的缺点，已经纠正或正在检查纠正中。对于在鸣放中揭露的一些作风不好、违法乱纪的党员干部，也已经根据情节轻重作了处理。
    关于生活福利方面的意见，已经基本上都得到了处理。例如，各单位都成立了群众性的伙食委员会。有十二个单位取消了小食堂，增加了主食品和副食品。有些单位还建立了回民食堂或食桌。不少单位成立了房屋管理委员会，对住房的实际情况作了深入调查，有二百六十六户的住房已经作了新的分配或调整。
