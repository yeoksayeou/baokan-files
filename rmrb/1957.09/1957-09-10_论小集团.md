On Cliques
Shan Bai

As the anti-Rightist struggle unfolds more broadly and deeply, just like the previous political and ideological struggle movements, various localities and units often discover the existence of one or even several cliques within their ranks. Each clique has its leader, its "struggle goals," with different names and forms, but with equally secretive actions. During the suppression of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, such organizations were discovered, such as "reading groups" and "literary societies." In this movement, a considerable number of large and small Rightist cliques have been discovered. In the literary and art circles alone, there are the Ding-Chen clique, the Jiang Feng clique, Wu Zuguang's "small family" clique, the "Katyusha" clique of the Academy of Drama, the "White Building" clique of the Changchun Film Studio, and groups associated with things like "social news," "city evening newspapers," and literary or artistic "journals," and so on. These cliques are not open, literary, or artistic schools of thought, nor are they scientific academic groups, but rather sectarian combinations with ulterior motives.

These clique members all have common characteristics, namely, opposition to leadership, resistance to ideological remolding, and whether they are Party members or non-Party members, all possess serious bourgeois individualism. So the question arises, since they are extreme individualists, why do they often form cliques and engage in covert organizational activities? Are these people really imbued with a "collective spirit"?

It is true that these individualists often band together, huddling together in a "collective." However, they are absolutely not true collectivists. They are vehement, even fanatical, anti-collectivists. Proletarian collectivism, which is opposed to bourgeois individualism, takes the interests of the proletariat and all of humanity as its battle goals. People with such ideals place the interests of the class and the collective above their personal interests, striving for the collective interest throughout their lives, and when necessary, sacrificing their personal interests, even abandoning their lives for the collective's lofty ideals. Therefore, they are true collectivists. They are selfless, forgetting their own interests for the public good, unaware of what personal gain even is. In the eyes of individualists, such people are "incomprehensible," even very "frightening" and "disgusting." Isn't that so? During this rectification campaign, Rightists frequently play this card against us, saying we "disown our relatives." Communists certainly do not abandon their relatives and friends, this is nonsense. As a communist, a proletarian fighter, one must have principles in handling relationships with relatives and friends, and must first see what kind of people those relatives and friends are. One cannot assume that because someone belongs to my "six kinds of relatives," I can be completely indifferent to their class background, political views, and so on. But what about those bourgeois individualists? They do not care whether the other party is a landlord, a counter-revolutionary element, a political turncoat, or a person dissatisfied with the Party; as long as the other party calls you a close friend, you "recognize" them all. It's like "recognizing a thief as your father." Such "recognizing all relatives," without any political principles or ideological boundaries, can only be harmful, not beneficial, right?

Of course, here, what is meant by benefits and harms is also said primarily in relation to the collective and to society. In the view of Rightists, the interests and harms of the collective are not even worth mentioning. They only want to ask one question: is it beneficial or harmful to them personally? And their personal interests often conflict with the interests of the collective. What is more beneficial to them personally is often more harmful to the collective; what is more harmful to the collective is often more beneficial to them. The creed of all their actions is personal first, self supreme, while the interests of the collective can be completely disregarded.

The reason they form cliques is nothing more than for personal gain. Because they share the same interests and smell the same, they come together, temporarily uniting, ostensibly acting in concert, using this "collective" to pursue selfish interests. Once they feel that this "collective" is unfavorable to them, that there is no profit to be gained, they will not hesitate to leave the "collective." Their "collective spirit" is extremely hypocritical and unreliable. This is not a "collective" at all, but an unprincipled combination with personal gain as its starting point and goal. This kind of "collective" is anti-collectivist.

The hypocrisy of this "collective" is manifested in their seeming agreement and concerted defense, just as Chen Qixia said, that with just a glance, a gesture, they tacitly understand each other and cooperate in opposing the Party. However, this is only a superficial and temporary phenomenon. Precisely because they take personal interests as the prerequisite for everything, their superficial and temporary unity cannot conceal their essential, inner "each acting on their own." So called, "each has a guilty conscience." These cliques, although they all have a leader, want to be the leader themselves, or at least be second-in-command, above the crowd. Because everyone wants to be the leader, these cliques are numerous and very small; because everyone wants to be at least the second-in-command, these cliques are often plagued by infighting and mutual attacks. And the result of the struggle is often that the cliques have very short lives, forming and dissolving frequently. Each member of the clique takes personal gain as their goal for advancement, so they often stay if they agree and leave if they disagree, joining and leaving at any time, creating the instability and so-called "intangible" characteristics of these cliques. Although the clique is "intangible," its essence is indeed an organization. As for, the fact that formerly irreconcilable opponents suddenly shake hands and make peace, and that two formerly antagonistic cliques suddenly merge into one, due to the reasons mentioned above, is not at all surprising.

Since these individualists negate the collective, negate society, and adopt a nihilistic attitude towards the cause of the class and humanity, and they are not able to truly achieve independence from the world, living a solitary life like Robinson Crusoe, after all, they can only live in a concrete social collective, then what do they do? Especially when the class they originally depended on, namely the bourgeoisie, has already perished? They have lost their direction and cannot see a way out. Their way of thinking? It's still the same old routine, so even in a socialist society, they still want to find a "Han Jingzhou" to rely on. At the same time, they also know that even Robinson Crusoe still needs a "Friday" to run errands for him, so they look for individualists like themselves, form gangs, pull and drag, flatter and applaud, whisper and gossip, doing some shady deeds, attempting to find a path where there is no path, outside the track of socialism. When they do this, counter-revolutionary spies can easily smell their footprints on this road with no way out. History is merciless, and small cliques that oppose leadership and oppose the collective will never have a good ending in a socialist society.

    论小集团
    山柏
    在反右派斗争更加广泛和深入地开展的时候，就像过去所进行的几次政治、思想斗争运动的情况一样，各地、各个单位往往发现他们那儿存在着一个以至几个小集团。每一个集团有领导人，有“奋斗目标”，名称和形式不同，而行动诡秘则一。在肃清胡风反革命集团的时候，发现过这样的组织，什么“读书会”，什么“文艺社”等。在这次运动当中，又发现了为数不少的右派大、小集团，仅以文艺界来说，就有丁、陈集团，江丰集团，吴祖光的“小家族”集团，戏剧学院的“卡秋莎”集团，长春电影制片厂的“小白楼”集团，以及什么“社会新闻”、“市民晚报”、文学或艺术的“同人刊物”等等之类的集团。这些小集团并不是公开的、文学艺术上的一个流派，科学上的一个学派，而是别有用心的宗派性的结合。
    这些小集团分子，都有着共同的特点，那就是反对领导，抗拒思想改造，不论是党员、非党员，一律具有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想。于是问题来了，既然他们是极端的个人主义者，怎么又往往结成集团，搞隐蔽的组织活动呢？难道这些人真是很有“集体精神”吗？
    不错，这些个人主义者往往成群结伙，纠成一团，搞的是“集体”。但是，他们绝对不是真正的集体主义者。他们是强烈的、甚至疯狂的反集体主义者。同资产阶级个人主义相对立的无产阶级的集体主义，是以无产阶级、全人类的利益为战斗目标的。具有这样理想的人把阶级的、集体的利益放在个人利益之上，终身为集体利益而奋斗，必要时可以牺牲个人利益，甚至为了集体的崇高理想而抛弃自己的生命。因此，他们是真正的集体主义者。他们大公无私，公而忘私，不知个人私利为何物。在个人主义者看来，这样的人是“不可理解”的，甚至是非常“可怕”“可厌”的。不是吗？在这次整风中，右派分子们经常翻出这样一张牌来打我们，说我们“六亲不认”。共产党人决没有连亲戚朋友都不要，这是胡说。作为一个共产主义者，一个无产阶级的战士，在处理亲友交往的问题上，不能没有原则，不能不先看一看那些亲戚朋友是何等样人。不能因为某某人既然属于我的“六亲”之列，就对他的阶级成分、政治面貌等等一律可以不闻不问。然而那些资产阶级个人主义者呢？他们却不管对方是地主也好，反革命分子也好，政治上的变节分子也好，对党不满分子也好，只要对方称你为至亲好友，你就一概“认”他。所谓“认贼作父”。这样的“六亲必认”，毫无政治原则、思想界限，难道不是只有害处，没有好处吗？
    当然，这里所谓好处和害处，也是说首先对于集体、对于社会来说的。在右派分子看来，集体的利和害却不在话下。他们只想问一句话：对他们个人有利还是有害？而他们的个人的利害，又往往与集体的利害相冲突。对他们个人越是有利的，往往对集体越是有害；对于集体越是有害的，对于他们反倒越是有利。他们一切行动的信条是个人第一，自我至上，至于集体的利益则可以完全弃置不顾。
    他们之所以结成小集团，无非也是为了个人私利。由于彼此利害相同，臭味相投，他们就碰在一块，暂时地结合起来，表面上一致行动起来，利用这个“集体”营私自肥。一旦他们觉得这个“集体”对自己不利了，无利可图了，他们就会毫不犹豫地脱离“集体”。他们的“集体精神”是十分虚伪的，靠不住的。这根本不是什么“集体”，而是以个人私利为出发点和目标的、无原则的结合。这种“集体”是反集体主义的。
    这种“集体”的虚伪性，表现在他们表面上仿佛情投意合，攻守一致，就像陈企霞所谓，只要一个眼色，一个手势，他们之间就心照不宣，互相配合反起党来了。但是，这仅仅是表面的、也是暂时的现象。正由于他们以个人利益为一切的前提，他们表面的暂时的一致，并不能掩盖他们实质上的、内心中的“各自为政”。所谓“各自心中有鬼”。他们这些集团，固然都有一个头子，可是他们又大家都想当头子，至少想一人之下，众人之上，坐第二把交椅。都想当头子，所以这些集团为数甚多，分得很小；都想至少坐第二把交椅，所以这些集团的内部又往往争权夺利，彼此倾轧。而斗争的结果，又往往是集团的命都很短，时而成立，时而瓦解。集团内各个成员都以各人私利为钻营的目的，也就往往合则留，不合则去，随时加入，随时退出，造成了这些集团的不固定性和所谓“无形”的特色。集团虽则“无形”，其实质确是一个组织。至于，原来是水火不相容的对手，忽而又握手言欢，原来是针锋相对的两个集团，忽而又合并在一块，由于上述的原因，更是丝毫也不值得奇怪了。
    既然这些个人主义者否定了集体，否定了社会，对阶级的、人类的事业采取了虚无主义的态度，而他们又并不能够真正做到遗世独立，离群索居，过鲁滨逊似的生活，毕竟还只能生活在具体的社会集体之中，那么他们到底怎么办呢，特别是当他们原来所依附的那个阶级即资产阶级已经灭亡的时候？他们迷失了方向，看不见出路。思想方法呢？还是老一套，于是，即使在社会主义社会中，他们还是想找一个“韩荆州”来投靠。同时，他们也知道即使做鲁滨逊也还是需要一个“礼拜五”替他跑腿办事，于是他们就找一些和他们一样的个人主义者，结成帮口，拉拉扯扯，吹吹拍拍，交头接耳，窃窃私语，干一些见不得人的勾当，企图在社会主义这条轨道之外，去找无路之路。当他们这样做的时候，反革命的敌探倒是很容易在他们所走的这条无路之路上嗅出他们的脚迹来的。历史无情，反领导、反集体的小集团，在社会主义社会里，决不会有好的下场。
