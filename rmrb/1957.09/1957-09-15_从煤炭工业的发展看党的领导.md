　　The Party's Leadership Seen From the Development of the Coal Industry
　　Wang Yifan, Deputy Chief Engineer, Production Technology Department, Ministry of Coal Industry

    Having been engaged in the coal industry for thirty years, the comparison of my experiences in the old and new societies has given me a deep understanding of the Party's tremendous role in leading the coal industry. The rightists' assertion that "the Party cannot lead industrial technology departments" is a completely distorted fallacy.
    First, looking at the construction achievements of the coal industry. During the period of the first Five-Year Plan of the new China, a total of 433 mines and open-pit mines were built, with a total annual production capacity of 117.36 million tons. In the old China, from 1878 to 1942, within sixty-four years, the highest annual coal output in the country was only 61.87 million tons.
    Looking at the coal mine construction technology. Before liberation, almost all of China's larger coal mines were controlled by imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists. Everything from exploration, design, construction, and even mechanical installation was handled by foreigners. Now we can design large and medium-sized mines, open-pit mines, and coal washing plants with an annual capacity of 1.5 million tons ourselves; we have learned special shaft sinking methods such as freezing and caisson sinking.
    In terms of coal mining methods, the old China had maintained outdated methods such as pillar extraction and caving for decades. Not only was the production efficiency low and resource recovery small, but it also remained at the level of hand-pick mining and basket transport. Safety conditions were also very poor. After liberation, a comprehensive technical reform was carried out on the original mines, and various production technical indicators have been significantly improved, greatly exceeding the highest production technical level in history in 1942. Hydraulic mining has begun in Kailuan and Pingxiang mines; new coal mining methods such as metal shield supports are being tested in Huainan mines. Most of the original naturally ventilated mines have been converted to mechanical ventilation. Due to the reform of production technology, the face of the mines has been fundamentally changed.
    In terms of technical level, we can now manufacture large mechanical equipment such as coal cutting machines, combined coal mining machines, winches, and fans ourselves; and we can skillfully master the operating techniques. Now the production capacity of each combined coal mining machine reaches 22,000 tons per month, which is close to the international operating level. In particular, the technology of hydraulic sand filling in thick coal seams and the experience of methane drainage have been disseminated and exchanged abroad. These are all outstanding achievements in coal technology.
    At the same time, due to the change of the private ownership of the means of social production to public ownership, the purpose of production is to meet the needs of the broad masses of people rather than to make money for a few capitalists, and the interests of workers are consistent with the interests of the country, which has promoted the upsurge of production. In the new society, production equipment is uniformly allocated rather than being independent of each other; staff members assist each other rather than exclude each other; production technology is exchanged with each other rather than being kept secret. In a word, the production systems of the old and new societies are essentially different, which is the main reason why the Party can lead coal mine technical work.
    In the past two months, with the gradual deepening of the anti-rightist struggle, we have received profound socialist education, and deeply realized that technical personnel must continue to transform their thinking, stand firm, so that they can distinguish between right and wrong and not lose their way in the storm of struggle.
    After liberation, through several major movements and studies, under the Party's policy of "unity, education, and transformation," the general ideological level of technical personnel has been improved. Some, through study and training, have gradually established a communist worldview, stood on the proletarian stand, and actively engaged in the struggle against the bourgeois rightists. However, some people believe that this struggle has little to do with them, and even sympathize with some of the rightists' remarks. Or they are insincere, evasive, and take a bystander attitude towards the movement. These situations have been reversed with the deepening of the movement and the gradual improvement of ideological understanding. However, in the course of the movement, some technical personnel, especially some senior technical personnel, have ultimately exposed their confused thinking.
    Why do these technical personnel have confused thoughts? I think the most important reason is that these technical personnel have not been tempered by class struggle, and participated in the construction work of the new society under the circumstances of peaceful transition. This earth-shaking change has had little impact on these technical personnel. Although they have made some progress in their thinking, they do not have a sufficient understanding of the beautiful prospects of the new society, and they still more or less miss the bourgeois lifestyle that they have become accustomed to in the past. The Party and the government have always respected, cared for, and cared for engineering and technical personnel in every possible way. However, some people are arrogant, overestimate their own progress, look down on others, think that their ideological transformation is almost complete, and even feel that they have learned a little Marxism-Leninism. This has seriously hindered their own ideological progress and improvement.
    In order to better serve the coal mine construction cause in the future, our engineering and technical personnel must be determined to strengthen ideological transformation under the leadership of the Party, in the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, abandon the remaining bourgeois ideas, stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and smoothly pass the socialist barrier.

### 从煤炭工业的发展看党的领导

　　从煤炭工业的发展看党的领导
　　煤炭工业部生产技术司副总工程师  王逸凡
    我从事煤炭工业已三十年，从新旧社会的经历对比中，深深体会到党领导煤炭工业的巨大作用。右派分子硬说“党不能领导工业技术部门。”完全是歪曲事实的谬论。
    首先从煤炭工业的建设成绩上看。新中国第一个五年计划期间，共建设矿井和露天矿四百三十三处，年生产总能力为一亿一千七百三十六万吨。而旧中国从1878年开始到1942年的六十四年内，全国煤矿最高年产量才六千一百八十七万吨。
    再从煤矿建井技术上看。解放前，我国较大的煤矿几乎全部掌握在帝国主义及官僚资本家手中。举凡勘探、设计、施工，甚至机械安装，都是外国人一手包办。现在我们自己已能设计大、中型矿井、露天矿和年洗一百五十万吨的洗煤厂；学会了冻结、沉井等特殊凿井方法。
    在采煤方法上，旧中国几十年来始终保持着残柱落垛等陈旧方法。不但生产效率低，资源回收少，而且一直停留在手镐采煤和拉筐运搬的水平上。安全情况也很坏。解放后对原有矿井进行了全面技术改革，各项生产技术指标均有显著的提高，大大超过历史上1942年的最高生产技术水平。在开滦及萍乡矿已开始用水力采煤；淮南矿试行着金属掩护支架等新的采煤方法。原来自然通风的矿井，绝大部分已改为机械通风。由于生产技术的改革，矿井的面貌从根本上得到了改变。
    在技术水平上，我们已经可以自己制造割煤机、联合采煤机、绞车及风机等大型机械设备；并且能熟练地掌握操作技术。现在每月每台联合采煤机的生产能力达到二万二千吨，已接近国际操作水平。特别是厚煤层的水砂充填技术、排放瓦斯的经验，都已向国外传播与交流。这都是煤炭技术上的突出成就。
    同时，由于社会生产资料的私有制改变为公有制，生产目的是为了满足广大人民的需要而不是为了少数资本家赚钱，工人利益与国家利益是一致的，这就促进了生产的高涨。在新社会里，生产设备是统一调配而不是各不相干；工作人员是互相协助而不是互相排挤；生产技术是互相交流而不是各守门户。一句话，新旧社会生产制度有本质的不同，这就是党所以能够领导煤矿技术工作的主要原因。
    两个月来，随着反右派斗争的逐步深入，我们受到了深刻的社会主义教育，深深体会到技术人员必须继续改造思想，站稳立场，才能明辨大是大非，不致在斗争的风暴中迷失方向。
    解放后，技术人员经过几次大的运动与学习，在党的“团结、教育、改造”政策下，一般的思想水平都有所提高。有的经过学习与锻炼，已经逐步建立了共产主义世界观，站在无产阶级立场，积极投入了反资产阶级右派的斗争。但是有些人员认为这场斗争与自己关系不大，甚至同情右派分子某些言论。或者是口是心非，躲躲闪闪，对运动采取旁观的态度。这些情况随着运动的深入开展，随着思想认识的逐步提高，已经有所扭转。但是在运动的过程中，终归暴露了一部分技术人员，特别是有些高级技术人员的思想是糊涂的。
    为什么这些技术人员会产生糊涂思想呢？我认为最主要的是这些技术人员没有经过阶级斗争的锻炼，在和平过渡的情况下参加了新社会的建设工作。这一场天翻地复的变化，对于这些技术人员的冲击很小。他们思想上虽然有些进步，但是对于新社会的美好远景认识不够，内心仍然或多或少地留恋过去已经习惯的资产阶级生活方式。党和政府对于工程技术人员一向是尊重爱护无微不至的。而有些人竟妄自尊大，对自己的进步估计过高，看不起别人，自以为思想改造已经差不多了，甚至于觉得已经学到一点马列主义了。这就严重地阻碍了自己思想的进步和提高。
    为了今后更好地为煤矿建设事业服务，我们工程技术人员必须下定决心，在党的领导下，在反资产阶级右派的斗争中，加强思想改造，抛弃残存的资产阶级思想，站稳立场，辨明是非，顺利地通过社会主义大关。
