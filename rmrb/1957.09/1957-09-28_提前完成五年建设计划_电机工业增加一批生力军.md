    Ahead of Schedule Completion of the Five-Year Construction Plan
    Motor Industry Gains New Strength

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing has overfulfilled the basic construction plan of the First Five-Year Plan three months and twenty days ahead of schedule by early September.

    By early September, the completed factories include the first-stage project of Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, Shenyang Cable Factory, Harbin Electric Meter Factory, and Harbin Insulating Material Factory; the basically completed factories include Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory and Harbin Carbon Brush Factory; the expanded factories include Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, Shenyang Transformer Factory, Shenyang High-Voltage Switchgear Factory, Shenyang Low-Voltage Switchgear Factory, Tianjin No. 1 Wire Factory, Hankou Battery Factory, Acheng Relay Factory, and Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory. In addition, three electrical machinery manufacturing schools have been established in Harbin, Shanghai, and Xiangtan; three machine manufacturing schools in Harbin, Chongqing, and Xi'an; and two technical worker schools in Harbin and Xi'an. The construction project of the Beijing Electrical Appliance Science Research Institute has also been basically completed.

    The successful completion of the basic construction plan of the First Five-Year Plan has fundamentally changed the face of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry and created favorable conditions for its future development. Before liberation, almost all the power equipment used in China was imported from capitalist countries. Now the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing has basically built manufacturing plants capable of producing major products such as 16,000 kW water turbines and hydroelectric generators, 12,000 kW steam turbine generators, 6,400 kW electric motors, 40,000 kVA 1120 kV large power transformers, 220 kV substation circuit breakers, instruments for automobiles and various electrical appliances, various capacitors, and 35 kV power cables.

    In addition to the projects that have been completed or are basically completed, major projects currently under construction include: a high-voltage, high-current test and research base being built with Soviet assistance; a factory producing 50,000 kW steam turbine generators (with the potential to produce 100,000 kW steam turbine generators); a factory producing 220 kV automatic fast air circuit breakers (with the potential to produce 400 kV automatic fast air circuit breakers); factories producing ultra-high voltage porcelain bushings, marine motors, and mercury rectifiers; and a factory producing major products such as 100,000 kW water turbines and hydroelectric generators. The completion of these factories and test research bases will enable China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry to move faster towards world standards.

    提前完成五年建设计划
    电机工业增加一批生力军
    本报讯　电机制造工业部已于9月上旬提前三个月零二十天超额完成了第一个五年的基本建设计划。
    到9月上旬，已经建成的工厂有哈尔滨电机厂第一期工程，沈阳电缆厂、哈尔滨电表厂、哈尔滨绝缘材料厂；已基本建成的工厂有西安电力电容器厂、哈尔滨电刷厂；已经扩建了的工厂有上海电机厂、沈阳变压器厂、沈阳高压开关厂、沈阳低压开关厂、天津第一电线厂、汉口电池厂、阿城继电器厂和上海电焊机厂等。另外，还建成了哈尔滨、上海和湘潭三个电机制造学校，哈尔滨、重庆和西安三个机器制造学校，以及哈尔滨和西安两个技术工人学校。北京电器科学研究院的建设工程也已基本完成。
    由于第一个五年的基本建设计划的胜利完成，根本上改变了我国电机制造工业的面貌，并为今后电机制造工业的发展创造了有利的条件。解放前，我国所用的电力设备几乎全部从资本主义国家输入。现在电机制造工业部已经基本建成了能够生产一万六千瓩水轮机和水轮发电机，一万二千瓩汽轮发电机，六千四百瓩电动机，40000千伏安1220千伏大型电力变压器，二百二十千伏变电站用断路器，汽车和各种电气用的仪表，各种电容器以及三十五千伏电力电缆等主要产品的制造工厂。
    除已经建成或基本建成的项目外，现在正在建设的重大项目有：苏联帮助我国建设的高电压、强电流试验和研究基地，有生产五万瓩汽轮发电机（并有生产十万瓩汽轮发电机的可能）的工厂，有生产二百二十千伏自动快速空气断路器（并有生产四百千伏自动快速空气断路器的可能）的工厂，有生产特高压电瓷套管、船用电机和水银整流器的工厂，有生产十万瓩左右的水轮机和水轮发电机的重要产品的工厂。这些工厂和试验研究基地的建成，将使我国电机制造工业更快地向世界水平迈进。
