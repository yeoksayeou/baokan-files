Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 11th: Today is the third day that the water level of the Songhua River in the Harbin area has been receding. By 6:00 PM, the water level had fallen to 119.81 meters, 25 centimeters lower than the highest water level last year, but still above the warning level (119.50 meters). Therefore, the 120,000-strong flood prevention army is still fighting on the city's embankments with heightened vigilance. In addition to continuing to reinforce the original embankments and carefully inspect for dangers, they are also working intensely to build a second line of defense in case of emergency.

The Binzhou (Harbin to Manzhouli) International Railway trunk line, which had been temporarily shut down due to the flood threat, resumed operation at 6:00 AM this morning.

　　哈尔滨水位继续回落
　　十二万防汛大军继续加固堤坝
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　今天是哈尔滨地区松花江水位回落的第三天，到下午六时水位已经落到一一九点八一公尺，比去年最高水位低二十五公分，但仍在警戒水位（一一九点五○公尺）以上。因此，十二万防汛大军仍然警惕百倍地战斗在市区的堤防上。他们除了对原有堤坝继续加固和细致查险之外，还在紧张修筑第二道堤坝，以防万一。
    受洪水威胁一度停车的滨洲（哈尔滨到满洲里）国际铁路干线，今天早晨六时恢复了通车。
