　　Three-Tube Radio
    This three-tube radio was recently successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Joint State-Private Radio Equipment Factory using electronic tubes from the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory. Its appearance is light and beautiful, the sound is clear, it can be listened to continuously for five or six hours, and the price is only half that of a five-tube radio. (Sun Guang)
　　Beautiful Velvet Saddle Blanket
    The velvet saddle blanket, beloved by Mongolian herdsmen, has recently been successfully woven by the Nanjing Yiguang and Yixin Yunjin Production Cooperative.
    Velvet Yunjin, with its exquisite carving, thick and soft velvet, and lustrous sheen, is a famous type of Nanjing Yunjin. This velvet saddle blanket is carved with ancient patterns beloved by herdsmen on both sides, such as lion balls and elephants, while the blank space in the middle is perfect for placing a saddle. The colors include royal blue, dark green, and purplish brown.
