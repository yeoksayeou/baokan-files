　　“Law”: Insiders and Outsiders
　　Liubing

　　"Laymen cannot lead experts" has become a mantra for the rightists. Even Zhang Yingnan, a bodyguard of the pseudo-legal system, chants it like a spell. He believes the Communist Party is suffering from the "disease" of "excessive blows" and "destructive behavior" towards the old laws, and needs him to "cure" it. So he analyzes the source of the disease, saying: "The party member leading cadres in the political and legal departments are all 'laymen,' 'do not understand the business,' and do not respect the old jurists." The prescription is also prescribed: "The old and new laws should be given equal importance, and we cannot simply welcome the new and abandon the old." Moreover, it is necessary to "learn and transform on the basis of the old in order to adapt to the needs."

　　This is truly a wonderful prescription: first, "give equal importance to the old and the new," and then "learn and transform (new law) on the basis of the old (law)." As long as the Communist Party and the people swallow this medicine, they can completely solve the problem: those who cruelly oppress the people will become officials again; the masses of the people will once again become prisoners; as for the "party member leading cadres," by then they will naturally all have been executed on the spot, and there is no need to distinguish between "insiders" and "outsiders." This would completely "adapt" to their "needs," but we are still unwilling to be fooled. Because we really don't have this "need."

　　The so-called "insider" is the "expert" in various industries. Like upright scientists and artists, there is indeed something worthy of special respect. But what kind of profession are "Kuomintang military judges" and "legislators of the puppet National Government"? What should they be called? Or perhaps reactionary "officials"? Some people even consider themselves "insiders" and shamelessly shout "laymen cannot lead experts," demanding that the Communist Party and the people especially "respect" them. It is truly unknown that there is still shame in the world.

　　In the way of "law," Communists are by no means outsiders. All reactionary jurists and old "officials" are not only unworthy of being called "insiders" in the face of the new "law," but are also separated by a distance of 108,000 miles. If they do not completely discard their set, they are not qualified to be a primary school student in the face of the new law. Insisting on putting on a dead posture to scare people will result in more than just disrespect.

　　“法”的内外行
　　流冰
    “外行不能领导内行”，成了右派分子们的符咒。就连伪法统的镖师张映南，也这样念念有词了。他认为共产党害了对旧法“打击太重”、“摧残行为”的大“病”。需要他来“治病”。于是他剖析病源，曰：“政法部门的党员领导干部都是‘外行’，‘不懂业务’，而对老法学家又不尊重”。药方也开出了：“新旧法应该并重，不能单纯迎接新的，抛弃旧的。”而且要“在旧的基础上学习改造才能适应需要。”
    这真是绝妙好方：先“新旧并重”，接着便“在旧（法）的基础上学习改造（新法）”。只要共产党和人民吞下这剂药，保管可以彻底解决了问题：残民以逞者再为堂上吏；人民群众重作阶下囚；至于“党员领导干部”呢，到那时自然都已就地格杀勿论了，是无需再分什么“内行”和“外行”的。这倒完全“适应”他们的“需要”了，可我们却还不肯上当。因为我们实在并没有这种“需要”。
    所谓“内行”，各行业中之“里手”也。如正直的科学家，艺术家，确有值得特别尊重的地方。但是，“国民党的军法官”，“伪国民政府的立法委员”算什么行道，应称作什么家呢？或可叫作反动的“官”家吧？竟也有人自居“内行”，而且大言不惭地喊着“外行不能领导内行”，要共产党和人民特别地去“尊重”他们。真不知人间尚有羞耻事。
    于“法”一道，共产党人绝不是外行。一切反动法学家和旧“官”家，不仅在新“法”面前称不起什么“内行”，而且是相距十万八千里的门外汉。倘不彻底丢掉他们那一套，要想在新法面前当一名小学生，也是不够格的。硬要摆出死架子来吓人，得到的岂止于不尊重。
