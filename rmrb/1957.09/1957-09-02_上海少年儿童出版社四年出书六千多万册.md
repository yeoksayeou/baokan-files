Shanghai Juvenile and Children's Publishing House Publishes Over 60 Million Copies in Four Years

    The quantity and quality of children's books published in Shanghai have grown and improved rapidly in recent years. Since its establishment in 1953, the Shanghai Juvenile and Children's Publishing House has published more than 1,600 new books (including new editions), with a total print run of over 62 million copies. Some books have print runs of over one million copies. Before liberation, the Children's Book Bureau only published a total of more than 1,000 new books in twenty years, and the largest print run for each book was less than 100,000 copies, with some as few as several hundred copies.
    In the past, most of the children's books published only sought to cater to children's interests and did not seek educational effects. Some even excessively published vulgar, low-level, absurd, and superstitious books. For example, the book "From Pangu to President Chiang" instilled a lot of reactionary ideas in children. After liberation, the ideological and artistic quality of publications has been significantly improved, and many books have been warmly loved by readers. Books such as "The Days of Being in Prison with Dad" and "The Story of Wang Xiaohe" have played a profound educational role in children. Many books have also received international recognition. Books such as "Chicken Feather Letter" and "Ancient Chinese Fables" have been published in nearly ten countries, including the Soviet Union, North Korea, France, and Japan.

    上海少年儿童出版社四年出书六千多万册
    上海市出版的少年儿童读物，几年来在数量和质量上都有飞速的增长和提高。上海少年儿童出版社自1953年创办以来，已出版了新书（包括新一版书）一千六百多种，印了六千二百多万册。有些书印数达一百万册以上。解放前，儿童书局二十年内才总共出版了一千多种新书，每种书印数最多的也不满十万册，少的只有几百册。
    过去出版的儿童书，绝大部分是只求迎合儿童趣味，不求教育效果。有的还滥出黄色低级以及荒唐、迷信的书籍。例如“从盘古氏到蒋总统”一书，给儿童灌输了不少反动思想。解放后，出版物的思想性和艺术性，都有显著的提高，许多读物受到读者热烈的喜爱。像“和爸爸一起坐牢的日子”、“王孝和的故事”等书在儿童中起着深刻的教育作用。还有不少书籍在国际上享有荣誉。“鸡毛信”、“中国古代寓言”等书籍已经在苏联、朝鲜、法国、日本等近十个国家出版。（据新闻日报消息）
