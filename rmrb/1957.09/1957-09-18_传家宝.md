　　"Heirloom"
　　Xia Feng
　　At an anti-Rightist meeting, Chen, the director of the foundry workshop, said that he had an heirloom and was willing to show it to the Rightist gentlemen.
　　Everyone knew Chen’s family history. From his grandfather’s generation, his family had been destitute, relying on blood and sweat to survive. In his generation, the entire inheritance was a tattered cotton robe and a cracked coarse porcelain bowl. In the year of liberation, he entered the factory as a bachelor, became a model worker the following year, started a family, and was promoted to workshop director last year... What "treasure" could be "handed down"?
　　To solve this mystery, I followed Director Chen to his home after the meeting.
　　Sister-in-law Chen and her eldest daughter, Lili, were watering flowers in the yard. Seeing her husband come in, she straightened up and smiled. When she noticed a stranger following her husband, she immediately stopped smiling and greeted him shyly: "Please come in."
　　After entering the house, she bustled about, pouring tea, offering cigarettes, and then busied herself preparing dinner. Before long, with a rich aroma of oil, the dishes were laid out on the table, still Director Chen's favorite two dishes: scrambled eggs with tomatoes and spicy meat.
　　"Come on, eat!"
　　"No." I thought of his heirloom and hurriedly asked, "Director Chen, that..."
　　"Okay, wait a moment..." As he spoke, he moved an unpainted wooden box from the inner room, the smile on his face instantly disappeared, and his hands trembled. I seemed to anticipate something, and my heart pounded.
　　I stared intently at his every move. I saw him gently open the lid of the box, drag out a faded package, and peel off layer after layer. Finally, I saw him peel off the last layer of cloth, revealing a ball of rotten cotton wrapped in cloth threads. Director Chen grabbed one end with trembling hands, and pieces of filthy, black rotten cotton fell to the ground, as if they were the remnants of that tattered cotton robe. I felt a buzzing in my head, as if all the blood had rushed to my forehead, and I couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh! Isn't this..." "You... still remember?" "Who could forget!..."
　　Eleven years ago, one winter, I lived in a remote, narrow, and dirty alley in Zhangjiakou. Next door was a "lodging house." Calling it a "house" was just a polite way of putting it. Two small, dilapidated houses, so broken down that you could reach over the eaves, and you had to bend over to get on the kang when you entered, otherwise the strings of dust on the roof would cover your neck. But because the rent was low, it housed some homeless, elderly, weak, and disabled people.
　　I don’t know when, a burly, strong young man joined the ranks of customers here: tall, with a bronze-colored face, thick eyebrows, big eyes, and thick lips; his clothes were not exactly neat, but he was not like other beggars.
　　One evening, I was squatting at the door gnawing on half a cornbread when the man strolled over, laboriously moved his thick lips, forced a smile, and then looked greedily at the cornbread in my hand. I understood, so I hurried home, took a cornbread, and handed it to him. He smiled at me and turned away.
　　Later, he quietly told me his surname was Chen, and that he was not a beggar or a worker, but a farmer. He had been driven out of his house for owing the landlord a dan of rent. His mother had died of cold and hunger on the way to Zhangjiakou. Now only he and his blind father were left. He hadn't been to the "market" for two days, and the two of them had been starving for two days. That cornbread was for his father to eat.
　　This morning, large snowflakes fell from the sky, and the ground was instantly covered with a foot-deep layer of snow. I carried my schoolbag and struggled step by step towards the school. Suddenly, a familiar voice sounded not far behind: "Wait, brother, I'll carry you!" I looked back and saw it was Director Chen. Unable to suppress the joy in my heart, but how could I bear to let him carry me? However, I couldn't refuse him. His two big hands grabbed my arms and tossed me onto his back. From then on, we became very good friends. He would send me to school early in the morning and pick me up at the school gate in the evening. If I didn't see him for a day, I would feel uncomfortable. When my father learned that I had made such a friend, he didn't object and often sent him leftover food and old clothes and socks.
　　Once, when school was dismissed late, a sandstorm suddenly blew up, so strong that you couldn't see the person in front of you. I stood woodenly at the school gate waiting for Director Chen, waited until the street lights came on, but still didn't see Director Chen's shadow.
　　I groped my way home. When I entered the door, my father told me: "...Director Chen was arrested, said to be in contact with the Eighth Route Army... His father also hanged himself..." I suddenly stiffened, and immediately felt like I had been hit heavily on the head, tears blurring my vision. After calming down a little, I ran to the lodging house. The old man had already been wrapped in a straw mat by the owner and buried, leaving only a tattered cotton robe. From then on, Director Chen never returned to the house. Some said he died of illness in prison, others said he was executed.
　　In fact, he did not die. When Zhangjiakou was liberated, he was released from prison and went to work in a factory.
　　I gradually woke up from my memories and stole a glance at Director Chen's face. Two crystal tears were embedded in his black eyes, and his lips were twitching violently: "This... is... my heirloom..."
　　I held his hand tightly, without saying a word. But in my heart, I was saying: "Yes. This is a priceless treasure, a true portrayal of that cannibalistic society! Even though the Rightist gentlemen rack their brains to slander and smear, they can never erase this ironclad fact!"

### “传家宝”

　　“传家宝”
　　夏风
    一次反右派的会上，铸工车间陈主任说，他有一件传家宝，愿意拿出来给右派先生们看看。
    陈主任的家谱大家是清楚的，从祖父辈就家贫如洗，靠血和汗来维持生活。到他这一辈，继承的全部遗产是一件破碎如麻的棉袍和一个裂了口的粗瓷碗。解放那年，光棍一条进了工厂，转年当了模范，成了家，去年提拔为车间主任……哪有什么“宝”可“家传”呢？
    为了破开这个谜，散会后，我就跟陈主任来到他家。
    陈大嫂正跟大女儿丽丽在院中浇花，见丈夫进来，直起腰一笑。当她发现丈夫身后还跟着个生人时，即刻止住笑，不好意思地打个招呼：“请屋里坐。”
    进屋后，她一阵忙碌，斟上茶，递过烟，就忙拾弄晚饭去了。不大会，随着阵阵浓烈的油香，饭菜摆满桌，仍然是老陈爱吃的两样菜：一个西红柿炒鸡子，一个辣子肉。
    “来，吃吧！”
    “不。”我想起了他的传家宝，忙问：“陈主任，你那……”
    “好，你少等会……”他说着从里屋搬出一个未上油的木箱，脸上的微笑登时不见了，手也颤起来。我像是预感到什么，心怦怦地跳起来了。
    我出神地看着他的一举一动，只见他轻轻打开箱盖，拖出一个褪了色的包裹，他剥去一层又一层，我终于看到他剥去最后一层布，露出一团用布丝缠着的烂棉花。老陈用颤抖着的双手抓起一头，一片片污黑的烂棉花落到地下，好像就是那件烂棉袍的剩余物。我只觉头轰的一下，像是所有的血都涌上脑门儿，禁不住出了声：“哦！这不是……”“你……还记得？”“谁能忘记呢！……”
    十一年前的一个冬天，我住在张家口一个偏僻、狭窄而又肮脏的胡同里。隔壁是一家“留人小店”。说“店”只不过好听些罢了。两间破得不堪收拾的小平房，伸手能超出房檐，进门得毛腰上炕，不然房顶上成串的灰尘就会落满脖颈。但由于店钱低，就留宿了一些无家可归的老弱残废。
    不知从什么时候起，这里的顾客中添了一个剽悍、健壮的小伙子：高高的身材，紫铜色脸堂，粗眉毛，大眼睛，厚厚的嘴唇；穿戴虽算不上整洁，可也不像其他丐民那样。
    一天黄昏，我正在门口托着多半拉窝头啃着，那人慢悠悠地走过来，吃力地牵动了下厚厚的嘴唇，强作了个笑脸，然后贪婪地瞅瞅我手中的窝头。我会意了，于是匆匆跑回家，拿了个窝头递给他。他朝我笑笑，转身走了。
    后来他悄悄告诉我他姓陈，还说他不是要饭的，也不是工人，是庄户人。因欠了地主的一担租被赶出门。母亲在来张家口的途中冻饿而死。如今只剩下他和双目失明的父亲。他两天没下去“市”，爷儿俩干巴饿了两天。那个窝头就是拿给他父亲吃的。
    这天早晨，天上飘着鹅毛大雪，地上登时落了尺把深。我背了书包，艰难地一步步地往学校挪动着。突然，从后边不远的地方响起一个熟悉的声音：“等等，兄弟，我背你去！”回头一看是老陈，抑制不住心中的愉快，可是怎能忍心让他背呢？然而，扭他不过，他的两只大手抓起我的胳膊一抡，我就跑到他的脊背上了。从这时起，我俩成了很要好的朋友了。早起送我上学，晚间到校门口接我，一天见不着，就觉得别扭。爸爸知道我交了这么个朋友，也不反对，常常把吃剩下的饭和穿旧了的衣袜送给他。
    有一次放晚学时，忽然刮起对面不见人的大黄风。我木然站在校门口等着老陈，一直等到路灯亮了，还不见老陈的影子。
    我摸索着走回家，进门爸告诉我说：“……老陈被抓走了，说是通了八路……他爸也上吊死了……。”我猛然一怔，顿时觉得脑门像挨了重重的一击，泪水糊住了眼球，稍定了定神，即跑到店内。老人已被店家用席头卷去埋了，只留下一件破烂不堪的棉袍。从此，老陈就没有回店。有的说病死在狱中，有的说被枪决了。
    其实，他并没有死。到张家口一解放，他出了狱，就进了工厂。
    我渐渐从回忆里醒来，偷眼看老陈的脸，他乌黑的大眼睛里嵌着两颗晶莹的泪花，嘴唇剧烈地抽搐着：“这……就是……我的传家宝……。”
    我紧握住他的手，没有说话。但我心里却在说：“是的。这是无价之宝，是那个吃人社会的真实写照！尽管右派先生们挖空心思的诬蔑、中伤，然而他们却无从抹杀这铁的事实！”
