The Key to Thoroughly Airing Views
　　Zhu Li

    When conducting the rectification movement in enterprises, as long as the leadership makes appropriate preparations and mobilizations, the masses can "speak out freely and fully." This has been repeatedly proven by recent events. However, how to further deepen the movement, how to enable the masses to speak their minds freely, and how to ensure that views are aired thoroughly is still a problem that leaders of enterprises currently in the "airing views" stage need to address.

    Judging from what has happened in some enterprises, if comrades doing leadership work do not have a correct attitude towards the rectification movement, it will affect the in-depth development of the movement.

    For example, some leading cadres, upon seeing big-character posters or hearing someone making sharp criticisms against them by name in group meetings, become impatient and eager to defend themselves, even wanting to investigate the motives and backgrounds of those who raise opinions. This plays a role in stifling the "speaking out freely and fully." Of course, it is not to say that leading cadres cannot defend themselves against any criticism. The problem is to adopt an analytical attitude: for criticisms that are correct or basically correct, one should sincerely accept them and quickly correct them; while for criticisms that are incorrect or not entirely correct, one needs to make appropriate explanations and defenses at an appropriate time, so as not to pour cold water on a movement that needs a certain amount of warmth.

    For another example, some leading personnel are not very interested in the masses' well-intentioned and correct criticisms and opinions, and show a lack of determination and courage to correct errors and shortcomings in their work. This attitude increases the masses' concerns, and some people think that offering opinions is a waste of time, so why bother!

    Still other leading comrades simply hold a passive attitude of "preparing to be criticized," which also affects the in-depth development of the movement.

    Therefore, to further deepen the movement, to enable people to "air views" thoroughly during the "speaking out freely and fully," the key lies in the ability of leading cadres to sincerely listen to the criticisms of the masses, and to carefully study the various opinions raised by the masses. First and foremost, for well-intentioned criticisms and correct opinions, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "rectifying while correcting." Anything that can be corrected immediately should be corrected immediately. This will help the masses to speak their minds freely and without reservation, to uncover the errors and shortcomings in leadership work so that they can be thoroughly corrected. At the same time, it will also allow all kinds of opinions to be "aired," so as to create good conditions for distinguishing between right and wrong in the next stage of great debates.

　　“鸣”“放”得深透的关键
　　朱力
    在企业中开展整风运动时，只要领导方面经过适当的准备和动员，群众就可以“大鸣大放”起来。这一点，已经为最近的事实一再证明过了。但是，要使运动进一步深入开展，要使群众畅所欲言，“鸣”“放”得既深且透，那还是正处在“鸣”“放”阶段的企业领导者们需要注意解决的问题。
    从某些企业已发生的情形来看，如果作领导工作的同志对待整风运动的态度不正确，就会影响运动的深入开展。
    例如，有的领导干部看到大字报或小组会上有人对他进行指名的尖锐的批评，就沉不住气，急于要替自己辩解，甚至要追查提意见的人的动机和历史，这对于“大鸣大放”就起了堵嘴的作用。当然，并不是说领导干部受到任何批评都不可以辩解。问题是要采取分析的态度：对于正确的或者基本正确的批评，应该诚恳接受并且迅速加以改正；而对于不正确的或不完全正确的批评，则需要在适当的时机，再去作适当的说明和辩解，才不致于给需要一定温度的运动泼冷水。
    又例如，有的领导人员对于群众的善意的正确的批评和意见兴趣不大，对于改正自己工作中的错误和缺点，显示出没有决心和勇气。这种态度就增加了群众的顾虑，有的人就认为提意见也是白提，何必多此一举！
    还有的领导同志单纯抱着“准备挨整”的消极态度，这也影响了运动的深入开展。
    因此，要使运动进一步深入开展，要使人们在“大鸣大放”当中“鸣”、“放”得深透，关键就在于领导干部们能够诚恳地倾听群众的批评，并且认真研究群众中所提出来的各种意见，首先是对于善意的批评和正确的意见，需要坚决贯彻执行“边整边改”的方针，凡能立即改正的就应该立即改正，这样才有助于使群众畅所欲言，毫无遗漏地把领导工作中的错误和缺点发掘出来，以便彻底改正；同时，也才能使各种意见都“鸣”“放”出来，以便更好地为下一步在大辩论中分清大是大非创造下良好的条件。
