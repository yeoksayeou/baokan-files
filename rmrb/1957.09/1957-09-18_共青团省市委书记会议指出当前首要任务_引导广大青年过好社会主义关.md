Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a meeting of provincial and municipal committee secretaries from August 25th to September 5th. The meeting focused on discussing how to strengthen the political and ideological education of youth during the current rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle. The meeting comprehensively analyzed the political and ideological outlook of youth, particularly intellectual youth, studied the main content and working methods for educating youth at present, and discussed issues related to the organizational construction of the League. Comrades Hu Ke Shi and Luo Yi, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the League, delivered reports and summaries at the meeting respectively.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the current rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the socialist ideological education movement led by the Party are struggles concerning the most fundamental question of whether the entire people will take the socialist road or the capitalist road. This struggle is of great educational and training significance for young people; for the Communist Youth League, it is a struggle to adhere to the communist direction of the youth movement. In this political and ideological socialist revolution, the Communist Youth League must unite and guide the broad masses of youth, actively participate in this struggle, firmly stand on the proletarian position, resolutely take the socialist road, and successfully navigate this socialist stage.

The meeting comprehensively analyzed the political and ideological outlook of Chinese youth. Generally speaking, Chinese youth have inherited the glorious revolutionary tradition; they love the motherland and support socialism. The Party enjoys unparalleled prestige among young people, and they firmly follow the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, they have made tremendous contributions to socialist construction through heroic labor. However, we must also see that this generation of Chinese youth, especially intellectual youth, also has weaknesses. They lack practical life knowledge and serious class struggle experience, have little understanding of the suffering of the old society, and do not understand the difficulties of building the new society, just as Chairman Mao pointed out in his report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people: "Some people think that everything should be good after reaching socialism, and that they can enjoy ready-made happy life without any effort." The influence of bourgeois individualism, liberalism, absolute egalitarianism, and nationalism still exists among young people, and the old traditions of despising workers and peasants, despising manual labor, and blind arrogance still exist among intellectual youth. The emergence of these problems is certainly related to some shortcomings in our past work, but mainly due to its class and social roots. Taking China's intellectual youth as an example, most of them come from the exploiting classes and the upper petty bourgeoisie, and they mostly received the old bourgeois education in the past. At the same time, since China's bourgeoisie is still being transformed and eliminated, and capitalism still exists internationally, its spread of influence cannot be underestimated. In addition, it should be noted that due to the deeper socialist revolution, people cannot but more clearly express their positions and attitudes on the major issues of right and wrong in the socialist revolution. What was not a problem in the past has now become a problem. What was not sharp in the past has now become sharp and does not allow people to be ambiguous. All of this means that the occurrence of many problems among young people is by no means a strange thing, nor is it a coincidence that it is happening today. The meeting pointed out that without understanding these things, it is impossible to truly understand the long-term and arduous nature of winning over and educating young people with communist ideology.

The meeting pointed out that the Youth League had the shortcoming of not paying enough attention to the political and ideological work of young people for a period of time in the past, and not paying enough attention to educating young people on class stand and class viewpoints. The meeting believed that the following points should also be noted in educating young people. That is, to love young people, but not to spoil them, or flatter them. The education of young people should be stricter, and political ideology and moral character should be closely grasped (but strictness is not equal to simplicity and rudeness); to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of young people, while educating young people to overcome individualism, and the desire to be in the limelight, and firmly establish the concept of obeying the leadership of the Party; to respect veteran workers, peasants, and revolutionary predecessors, and learn from them with an open mind. In the method of educating young people, we must absorb the experience of this anti-Rightist struggle. We must greatly promote the method of the mass line and oppose the method of dogmatism. For political and ideological problems among young people, we must adopt the methods of airing views and debating, and be good at using typical examples to educate young people.

The meeting pointed out that in the current anti-Rightist struggle and the socialist ideological education movement, the League organization must especially help the broad masses of youth improve their thinking and understanding on the following four issues:

First, to firmly establish the proletarian stand, distinguish the enemy from ourselves during the socialist revolution, and resolutely take the socialist road. We must make young people understand that the proletarian stand is in line with the greatest interests of the vast majority of people. Without a stand, one cannot distinguish right from wrong or find the truth. The issue of political stand is a matter of direction for a person and is a fundamental issue.

Second, to establish the idea of serving the people and the spirit of collectivism. Resolutely eliminate bourgeois individualism, correctly understand the relationship between democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, strengthen organization and discipline, and oppose the ideological influence of liberalism, egalitarianism, and nationalism.

Third, to promote the spirit of hard struggle, building the country with diligence and thrift, managing the home with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and help young people establish correct labor concepts. In particular, intellectual youth should firmly integrate with workers and peasants and serve workers and peasants.

Fourth, to love the Party more, obey the leadership of the Party, and always stand with the Party.

The meeting required all levels of the Youth League Committee to regard the political and ideological work of young people as their primary task. We must never regard ideological work as merely a matter for the propaganda department of the Youth League Committee. Secretaries of Youth League Committees at all levels must first take the lead in grasping ideological work well. And it is necessary to especially strengthen the leadership of the Youth League's newspaper and publication work.

The meeting believed that, in conjunction with the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the socialist great debate, the League's ranks should be seriously rectified, the League's organizational construction should be strengthened, and the League's combat effectiveness should be improved, so as to better play the core role of the Communist Youth League in the national youth.

The primary issue in the current organizational construction of the League is to rectify and strengthen the ranks of League cadres, and to improve the political quality, that is, the class quality, of the League's leading backbone. We must treat the issue of League cadres from the principled height of the organizational line. The meeting pointed out that the vast majority of League cadres, especially those above the district level, are of student origin and have not undergone the tempering of serious class struggle and labor practice. Some people still have relatively strong bourgeois individualistic thinking, lack a clear proletarian stand and viewpoint, lack strong class feelings and love for the working people, and still retain the conceited psychology of intellectuals, and have the erroneous viewpoint of despising labor, and lack a hard-working and simple work style. In this great airing of views and free expression, a very small number of anti-Party and anti-socialist Rightists who had sneaked into the revolutionary ranks were also exposed. Obviously, without changing this situation, and without seriously transforming and improving the ranks of League cadres, it is impossible to consolidate and improve the entire League ranks.

The meeting requested that Youth League committees at all levels conscientiously implement the decision of the Third National Congress of the League on organizing League cadres to participate in productive labor, and in the next few years, systematically and in batches send League cadres, especially intellectual cadres who have not participated in labor, to the countryside or factories and mines to participate in physical labor for a longer period of time, and obtain the qualifications of workers or peasants. In the future, when promoting cadres, in general, priority should be given to selecting outstanding elements from workers and peasants and intellectuals who have undergone arduous struggle and labor training.

The meeting also discussed strengthening the construction of the League's grassroots organizations, how the organs of the League Committee at all levels should carry out rectification, how to rectify and improve at the same time, and resolutely improve work.

　　共青团省市委书记会议指出当前首要任务
　　引导广大青年过好社会主义关
    帮助青年在四个问题上提高认识：一、坚定无产阶级的立场是一个根本问题。二、坚决清除资产阶级个人主义，树立为人民服务的思想和集体主义精神。三、发扬艰苦奋斗精神，树立正确的劳动观念，特别是知识分子要坚定地与工农结合，为工农服务。四、更加热爱党、服从党的领导，永远和党站在一起。
    据新华社17日讯　共青团中央在8月25日至9月5日召开各省、市委书记会议，着重讨论了在当前整风、反右派斗争中加强青年的政治思想教育工作的问题。会议全面地分析了青年特别是知识青年的政治思想面貌，研究了当前教育青年的主要内容和工作方法，并且对团的组织建设问题进行了讨论。胡克实和罗毅同志分别代表团中央常委会先后在会议上作了报告和总结。
    会议一致认为，当前党所领导的整风、反右派斗争和社会主义思想教育运动，是关系到全体人民走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路这样一个最根本的问题的斗争；这个斗争对于青年来说具有伟大的教育和锻炼的意义；对于共青团来说，是坚持青年运动的共产主义方向的斗争。在这一次政治上和思想上的社会主义革命当中，共青团必须很好地团结和引导广大青年，积极地参加这个斗争，站稳无产阶级立场，坚定地走社会主义道路，胜利地过好社会主义这一关。
    会议全面分析了我国青年的政治思想面貌。从总的情况来说，我国青年继承了光荣的革命传统，他们热爱祖国，拥护社会主义。党在青年中享有无比的威信，他们坚定地跟着党走。他们在党的领导下以英勇的劳动，在社会主义建设中作出了巨大贡献。但是，我们也要看到，我国这一代青年特别是知识青年本身也存在着弱点。他们缺乏实际生活知识和严重的阶级斗争的锻炼，很少了解旧社会生活的苦难，不懂得新社会建设的艰难，正如毛主席在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题报告中所指出的：“有些人以为到了社会主义就应当什么都好了，就可以不费气力享受现成的幸福生活了”。在青年中还存在着资产阶级的个人主义、自由主义、绝对平均主义、民族主义思想的影响，轻视工农、轻视体力劳动、盲目自大的旧传统影响在知识青年中还是存在着的。这些问题的产生固然和我们过去工作的某些缺点有关，但是主要的是由于它的阶级根源和社会根源。以我国的知识青年来说，他们多数出身于剥削阶级和上层小资产阶级，他们过去又多是受的资产阶级旧教育，同时，既然我国的资产阶级还正在改造、消灭中，国际上还存在着资本主义，因此它们散布的影响，就是不能低估的。另外，还要看到，由于社会主义革命更加深刻化，迫使人们对于社会主义革命中间的大是大非问题，不能不更明确地表明自己的立场和态度。过去不是问题的，现在成了问题。过去不尖锐的问题，现在尖锐了，不容人们有所含混。所有这些，也就是说，青年中许多问题的发生，决不是什么奇怪的事，也不是今天才偶然发生的。会议指出，不懂得这些，就不可能真正懂得以共产主义思想争取和教育青年的长期性和艰巨性。
    会议指出，过去一个时间内青年团对青年的政治思想工作曾经有过抓得不够紧的缺点，对于向青年进行阶级立场和阶级观点的教育抓得不够紧。会议认为，在教育青年问题上，还应当注意下列几点。这就是要爱护青年，但不能娇惯青年，捧青年；对青年的教育要严格一些，对政治思想和道德品质要抓紧一点，（但是严格不等于简单粗暴）；要发扬青年的积极性和创造性，同时要教育青年克服个人主义，风头主义，巩固地树立起服从党的领导观念；尊重老年工人、农民、革命前辈，并向他们虚心学习。在教育青年的方法上要吸取这次反右派斗争的经验，我们要大大提倡群众路线的方法，反对教条主义的方法。对于青年中的政治思想问题，要采用鸣放和辩论的方法，要善于运用典型去教育青年。
    会议指出，在当前反右派斗争和社会主义思想教育运动中，团的组织必须特别帮助广大青年在下列四个问题上提高思想，提高认识：
    第一、是坚定无产阶级的立场，分清社会主义革命时期的敌我界限，坚决地走社会主义道路。要使青年懂得，无产阶级立场是符合于最大多数人民的最大利益。没有立场，就分辨不了是非，找不到真理。政治立场问题是一个人的方向问题，是个根本问题。
    第二、树立为人民服务的思想和集体主义精神。坚决清除资产阶级个人主义，要正确理解民主和集中、自由和纪律的关系，加强组织性纪律性，反对自由主义、平均主义和民族主义的思想影响。
    第三、是发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭持家、勤俭办一切事业的精神，帮助青年树立正确的劳动观念，特别是知识青年要坚定和工农结合，为工农服务。
    第四、要更加热爱党、服从党的领导、永远和党站在一起。
    会议要求各级团委把对青年的政治思想工作当作自己的第一工作。决不能把思想工作看作只是团委宣传部门的事情。各级团委书记首先都要以身作则地很好地抓思想工作。并且要特别加强对团的报刊工作的领导。
    会议认为，结合整风、反右派斗争和社会主义大辩论，应当认真整顿团的队伍，加强团的组织建设，提高团的战斗力，以便更好地发挥共产主义青年团在全国青年中的核心作用。
    当前团的组织建设中的首要问题，是整顿和加强团的干部队伍，是提高团的领导骨干的政治质量，也就是阶级质量的问题。必须把团的干部问题，提到组织路线的原则高度来看待。会议指出：团的干部特别是区以上的干部，绝大多数都是学生出身，没有经过严重的阶级斗争和劳动实践的锻炼，部分人还存在着比较浓厚的资产阶级个人主义思想，缺乏鲜明的无产阶级立场、观点，缺乏强烈的阶级感情和对劳动人民的热爱，还保留着知识分子的自大心理，有轻视劳动的错误观点，缺乏艰苦朴素的工作作风。在这次大鸣、大放中也还暴露了极少数是属于混进革命队伍的反党反社会主义的右派分子。很显然，不改变这种情况，不认真地改造和提高团的干部队伍，是不可能使整个团的队伍得到巩固和提高的。
    会议要求各级团委认真执行团的第三次全国代表大会关于组织团的干部参加生产劳动的决定，在今后若干年内，有计划地分期、分批地把团的干部特别是把没有参加过劳动的知识分子干部下放到农村或厂矿中去，较长时间地参加体力劳动的锻炼，取得工人或农民的资格。今后在提拔干部时，一般的应首先从工人、农民中的优秀分子和经过艰苦斗争和劳动锻炼的知识分子中去选拔。
    会议还讨论了加强团的基层组织建设，各级团委机关进行整风、如何边整边改、坚决改进工作等问题。
