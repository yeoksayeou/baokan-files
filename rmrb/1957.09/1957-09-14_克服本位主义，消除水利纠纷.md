　　Overcome Localism, Eliminate Water Conservancy Disputes
　　*People's Daily* Commentator

　　Drainage disputes between regions are still a problem that deserves serious attention. Especially in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, there are disputes between provinces, as well as many water conservancy disputes between special districts, counties, townships, and cooperatives within the provinces. More than twenty cases have been reported to the central government just between provinces. Within a single province, according to a report from Shandong Province, statistics from six special districts last year showed a total of 854 water conservancy disputes, of which 634 occurred in Heze Special District alone. There are also many in Hebei, Henan, and other provinces. Some are so serious that they have led to struggles involving thousands of people building and destroying dams, with sharp antagonism between regions, cadres, and the masses. In order to meet the production needs of the masses, many provinces and regions have invested a large number of cadres for a long time in repeated surveys and consultations in order to find a solution. At present, this situation is still serious and tense. These disputes can be summarized into the following types:

　　In some rivers, the upstream flow is large and the downstream discharge capacity is small. Before large-scale flood control is carried out, when encountering floods that existing projects cannot resist, temporary flood diversion measures must be taken in a planned manner to reduce losses. Due to the impact on the interests of different regions, there are conflicts in the selection of flood diversion and detention areas, and the standards for flood prevention of dikes on the upstream and downstream, left and right banks have not been unified for a long time and cannot be resolved now.

　　Another situation is that disputes also arise from the use of projects due to poor engineering design or lack of proper arrangements for flood discharge. For example, the Hongbei Depression inland river detention area project in Henan Province only built the Hei Li section flood control embankment at the junction of Henan and Anhui provinces, without carefully calculating the water volume, arranging an outlet for the flood, or implementing control measures. Once flood diversion is used, it will not only increase the disaster in Henan Province, but also the disaster in downstream Anhui Province cannot be avoided, thus causing serious disputes between the two provinces. After months of investigation and consultation, this dispute was finally resolved reasonably on a temporary basis under the auspices of the central government. For another example, the flood diverted from the Jiangfengkou Diversion Sluice overflows in the vast areas of Pi and Cang. In order to protect farmland and villages, Cangshan County built enclosed fields, reducing the flood storage area in the upstream; Pi County built dams downstream to prevent water from flowing downstream. As a result, the cadres and masses in the two regions became sharply opposed.

　　The masses want to drain water to increase production, but there is no overall plan or unified arrangement for drainage measures. Most of the projects are based on the interests of their own units and regions, and are very blind. Mostly, the upstream emphasizes digging ditches for drainage, quickly discharging water downstream to reduce waterlogging disasters upstream; the downstream emphasizes blocking dams or raising roadbeds or building dams on flat ground, even blocking river channels or bridge openings, preventing water from flowing downstream, to reduce the submerged area downstream. Therefore, they dig at the top and block at the bottom, causing disputes. This type of dispute is the most common this year. When doing projects, it is often a blitzkrieg to create a fait accompli, fearing that the other party will not agree if they consult beforehand, and the project will not be completed. For example, the Dingyang River water conservancy dispute between Pingyu County in Henan Province and Linquan County in Anhui Province is like this. Henan raised the dikes of the Dahuanggang, a tributary of the Hong River, increasing the amount of water discharged into Linquan County through the Dingyang River; Linquan County then blocked the Dingyang River with dams and raised the Zhouhuang Highway along the county boundary, blocking all drainage ditches, preventing water from Pingyu County from flowing downstream. They did not consult with each other beforehand or consider the overall situation, thus forming a serious dispute, which once led to an event where more than 3,000 people armed with weapons forcibly demolished the dikes.

　　In addition, there are also conflicts between water conservancy projects and railways and highways. Some railway and highway bridges have small culverts or disrupt the drainage system, hindering drainage, and causing disputes with the masses.

　　In dealing with already formed water conservancy disputes, often because the cadres on both sides only proceed from the one-sided interests of their own units without taking into account the overall interests, they argue with each other and cannot reach an agreement after months of consultation. Some reach an agreement but do not implement it, or repeatedly overturn the agreement, causing the dispute to drag on for a long time.

　　In order to completely resolve this contradiction, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over all flood control and drainage water conservancy measures in neighboring provinces, counties, townships, and cooperatives. For projects that must be done, meetings of relevant parties should be held first to conduct surveys and research, starting from the overall situation based on the basin and region, giving overall consideration to the upstream and downstream, left and right banks, flood control, drainage, water storage, and water discharge, weighing the pros and cons, and making a comprehensive plan. After obtaining the consent of all parties, construction should be carried out under leadership according to the plan and schedule. It is necessary to immediately stop the chaotic phenomenon of blindly digging ditches for drainage and blindly blocking dams to prevent water, regardless of others. All small-scale farmland water conservancy and drainage projects must be subject to the overall plan. Projects that conflict with the plan and only benefit oneself but harm others should be stopped and the status quo maintained. For projects that are not complete enough, all possible measures should be taken to quickly improve them.

　　This year, water conservancy disputes have continued to occur in various places during the flood season. Now the flood season will soon pass, and various water conservancy improvement projects for this winter and next spring should be planned early and arranged appropriately. Relevant departments in various places should take the initiative to consult with each other and conduct joint surveys and research on existing projects and areas with disputes, as well as future flood control and drainage improvement projects, and put forward plans as soon as possible in the spirit of mutual benefit to improve the projects, so that the disputes can be resolved correctly and thoroughly.

　　Before the flood control and drainage problems of rivers and regions are completely resolved, the various existing disputes should be negotiated and resolved in a spirit of taking care of the overall situation, mutual care, unity and mutual benefit, referring to historical and natural conditions, and minimizing losses as much as possible. For all agreements reached or existing agreements, cadres and the masses should be educated to adhere to the implementation of the agreements. Party committees, people's committees, and supervisory departments at all levels should conscientiously implement the agreements, conduct inspections and supervision, give praise to those who implement them well, and appropriately deal with those who violate the agreements or cause losses.

　　Whether the disputes can be resolved smoothly depends on whether the leading cadres adopt the correct attitude. If cadres in various places can proceed from the overall interests of the whole people in everything, the disputes will be resolved quickly, and the agreements can be thoroughly implemented. Party committees and governments at all levels should continuously carry out ideological education for cadres in various places, strengthen cadres' overall concept, and overcome the localist ideology of benefiting oneself at the expense of one's neighbors.

　　克服本位主义，消除水利纠纷
　　本报评论员
    地区间的排水纠纷仍是值得严重注意的一个问题。特别是河北、河南、山东、安徽、江苏等省，省与省间有纠纷，省境专区与专区、县与县、乡与乡、社与社之间也有很多的水利纠纷。只是省与省之间反映到中央来的就有二十多起。在一省以内的，据山东省报告，去年六个专区的统计，共发生水利纠纷八百五十四起，其中菏泽专区就有六百三十四起。河北、河南等省内的也很多。有的严重到形成数千人打坝扒坝的斗争，地区间、干部间、群众间有尖锐的对立情绪。为了满足群众生产要求，很多省区已长期地投入了一大批干部反复地进行勘查协商，以便求得解决。目前，这种情况还是严重的、紧张的。这些纠纷归纳起来有以下几种类型：
    有一些河道上游来量大、下游泄量小，在没有进行大规模治理控制洪水以前，在遭遇到已有工程不可抗拒的洪水的时候，必然要有计划地采取临时分洪等措施，以减少损失。由于影响地区间的利害，在分洪滞洪区域的选择上彼此有矛盾，上下游、左右岸堤防防御洪水标准问题长期得不到统一，现在仍然不能解决。
    另一种情况是由于工程设计考虑不周，或因对洪水没有适当的安排出路，因而在运用上也有纠纷。如河南洪北洼地的内水河滞洪区工程，在河南、安徽交界处仅修了黑李段拦洪大堤，既没有很好的计算水量，也没有给洪水安排出路，更没有做控制工程，一旦运用分洪，不但增加河南省的灾害，下游安徽省的灾害也不能避免，因此造成了两省地区间严重的纠纷。这个纠纷经过几个月勘查协商，最后在中央主持下，合理地做了临时处理。再如江风口分洪闸所分出的洪水，在邳、苍广大地区漫流，群众为了保护农田庄园，苍山县则做围田，缩小了上游行洪面积；邳县在下游筑坝，以阻水下泄。这样，两个地区干部群众间就尖锐对立起来。
    群众要排水增产，但对排涝措施没有全盘规划、统筹安排，很多是从本单位、本地区的利益出发，所做的工程带有很大的盲目性。多是上游强调挖沟排水，将沥水迅速下泄，以减少上游沥水成灾；下游强调堵坝或抬高路基或平地打坝，甚至把河道或桥孔堵塞，阻水下泄，以减少下游淹没面积。因而上扒下堵，引起纠纷。今年的纠纷以这一类型为最多。在做工程的时候，多是闪电突击，先造成既成事实，怕先协商对方不同意，工程做不成。如河南省平舆县和安徽省临泉县丁洋河水利纠纷就是如此。河南将洪河支流大黄港加高堤防，增大了丁洋河向临泉县泄水量；临泉县则把丁洋河打坝堵死，并沿县界将周潢公路加高，将所有排水沟港全部堵死，阻住了平舆县沥水下泄，互不事先协商，统盘考虑，因而形成了严重的纠纷，曾一度发生集中三千多人武装扒堤的事件。
    此外，水利工程和铁路、公路相互也有矛盾。有的铁路、公路桥涵小，或打乱了排水系统，阻碍了排水，与群众发生了纠纷。
    在处理已经形成的水利纠纷问题上，往往因为双方干部只从本单位片面的利益出发，而不照顾整体利益，互相争持不下，协商数月达不成协议。有的达成协议而不贯彻执行，或再三推翻协议，致使纠纷长期纠缠不清。
    为了彻底解决这个矛盾，必须对邻省、邻县、邻乡、邻社的一切防洪排涝水利措施加强领导。必须做的工程应先召开有关方面的会议，进行勘查研究，按流域，按区域，从全面出发，对上下游、左右岸，防洪排涝蓄水排水等方面统筹兼顾，权衡利弊，合理安排，做出全面规划。征得各方同意，按规划按计划有领导地施工。要立即制止那种只顾自己不管别人的盲目挖沟排水、盲目堵坝阻水的混乱现象。凡小型农田水利和排涝工程，则必须服从整体规划。与规划有矛盾，只利自己不利别人的工程，应停止施工，维持现状。所做工程不够完备的，应想尽一切办法，迅速改善。
    今年汛期各地水利纠纷仍然不断发生。现在汛期很快就要过去，今冬明春各种水利改善工程，应及早打算适当安排。各地有关部门对已经存在的有纠纷的工程和地区，以及今后防洪排涝的改善工程，应主动互相协商，共同进行勘查研究，本着互利精神及早提出计划，改善工程，使纠纷正确地彻底地解决。
    在河流和地区的防洪排涝问题没有彻底解决以前，现在存在的各种纠纷，应从照顾全局、相互关怀、团结互利的精神出发，参照历史自然情况，尽量减少损失，实事求是地协商解决。凡是达成协议的或原有协议的，应教育干部和群众，坚持执行协议。各级党委人委以及监察部门应认真执行协议，进行检查监督，对执行好的给以表扬，对破坏协议或造成损失的适当处理。
    纠纷能否顺利解决，关键在于领导干部是否采取正确的态度。各地干部能事事从全民的整体利益出发，纠纷就会迅速解决，协议也就能彻底执行。各级党委和政府对各地干部要不断地进行思想教育工作，加强干部的整体观念，克服以邻为壑的本位主义思想。
