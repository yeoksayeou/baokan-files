Vice President Radhakrishnan's Speech

Your Excellency Mr. Chairman,
Ladies and Gentlemen:

Mr. Chairman, I am very grateful for your very warm welcome and for your appreciation of the modest efforts we have made in our country's domestic development and our role in international affairs.

We, like you, recognize that the new force inspiring the people of Asia and Africa is the force of striving for freedom, the will to strive for freedom, which is a common characteristic of all dependent people today. Once they achieve freedom, the impetus that inspires them is the demand for social justice. They want freedom not just to put a few in leadership positions, or to grant rights to a privileged few, they want to give social welfare to all who belong to their country. Therefore, the will to strive for freedom and the demand for social justice are the two driving forces of our world today. We are cooperating with all countries to enable dependent people to liberate themselves and to help those nations achieve social progress in their own economies. Therefore, in these respects, we stand with you. As we have said many times, we hope to see the Chinese people enter the United Nations organization, because without the presence of representatives of the great Chinese people, the United Nations organization itself is flawed.

If there may still be inconsistencies in some details, everyone knows that the Chinese people's characteristics for generations have been non-dogmatic. They have always believed that the blind faith of religious fanatics is wrong. This is not in line with the Chinese people's minds and talents. Mr. Chairman, it is not surprising that you do not regard Marxism as a dogma, but as a dynamic belief that can be used to correct the current situation and make them fit your own mind.

I have no doubt that under your leadership, socialism will become democratic and humanitarian, and the views of our two countries will be closer to each other and become almost identical. Therefore, I am now very happy to propose:

A toast to your long life, health and happiness, Mr. Chairman!
A toast to the progress and prosperity of your people!

### 拉达克里希南副总统的讲话

　　拉达克里希南副总统的讲话
　　主席先生阁下，
　　女士们和先生们：
    先生，我非常感激你的非常热烈的欢迎词，和你对于我们在我国的国内发展方面所作的微薄的努力和我们在国际方面的作用的重视。
    我们同你一样认识到，鼓舞着亚非国家人民的新力量是争取自由的力量，争取自由的意志，这是今天一切附属国人民的一个共同特点。一旦他们取得自由之后，鼓舞他们的动力就是关于社会正义的要求。他们要自由并不只是为了让少数人居于领导地位，或者给予少数享有特权的人以权利，他们要把社会福利给予属于他们国家的一切人。因此争取自由的意志和关于社会正义的要求是目前我们的世界的两个动力。我们正在同一切国家合作，以便使附属国人民能够解放他们自己，帮助那些民族在他们自己的经济方面求得社会进步。因此在这些方面，我们是和你们站在一起的。正如我们多次说过的，我们希望看到中国人民进入联合国组织，因为没有伟大的中国人民的代表出席，联合国组织本身就是有缺陷的。
    如果说某些方面的细节可能还有不一致的地方，大家知道中国人民世世代代的特点是不专断。他们一向认为，宗教狂热者的盲目信仰是错误的。这是不符合中国人民的心意和天赋的。主席先生，你不把马克思主义看作教条，而把它当作充满活力的信念，能用它来纠正目前状况，使它们合乎你自己的心意，这是毫不奇怪的。
    我毫不怀疑，在你的领导下，社会主义将变成民主的和人道主义的，我们两国的观点将互相接近，并且变得差不多趋于一致。因此，我现在非常高兴地提议：
    为你，主席先生的长寿、健康和幸福而干杯！
    为贵国人民的进步和繁荣而干杯！
