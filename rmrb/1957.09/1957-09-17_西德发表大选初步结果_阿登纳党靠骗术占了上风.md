　　West Germany Announces Preliminary Election Results
　　Adenauer's Party Gains Upper Hand Through Deception
Xinhua News Agency, September 16th, Bonn Dispatch: The West German government today announced the preliminary results of the West German Federal Parliament election.

According to preliminary calculations by West German officials, out of the four hundred and ninety-four seats in the next West German Federal Parliament, the Christian Democratic Union will hold two hundred and sixty-seven seats, the Social Democratic Party one hundred and sixty-nine seats, and the Free Democratic Party forty-one seats. Although the Refugee Party obtained one million three hundred thousand votes, it will not be able to obtain seats in parliament because the votes it obtained were less than 5% of the total national votes. Although the German Party, with particularly strong fascist overtones, received less than 5% of the total votes, it was able to obtain seventeen seats in parliament because it won a majority in three electoral districts with the support of Adenauer's party.

Democratic German Radio pointed out today in its commentary on the preliminary results of the West German election: The reason Adenauer's party was able to win a majority was because they used deception and lies to conduct their campaign. They talked grandly about disarmament, but were actually expanding their military. Moreover, Adenauer's party has been using terror tactics against its election opponents.

　　西德发表大选初步结果
　　阿登纳党靠骗术占了上风
    据新华社16日讯　波恩消息：西德政府今天发表了西德联邦议院选举的初步结果。
    根据西德官方的初步计算，在下届西德联邦议院的四百九十四个议席中，基督教民主联盟将占二百六十七席，社会民主党一百六十九席，自由民主党四十一席。难民党虽然获得一百三十万张选票，但是因为所得的选票不到全国总票数的5％，所以不能在议会里取得议席。法西斯色彩特别浓厚的德意志党虽然得票不到总数的5％，但是由于它在阿登纳党的支持下在三个选区里取得多数，因而能在议会里取得十七个席位。
    民主德国广播电台今天在评论西德大选的初步结果时指出：阿登纳的党所以能得多数是因为他们是用欺骗和说谎的手段来进行竞选的。他们侈谈裁军，实际上是在扩军。而且阿登纳的党一直在采取恐怖手段对付它的竞选对手。
