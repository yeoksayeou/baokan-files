　　Humanity's Hope
　　Bìyě
　　Humanity's hope was already conceived in the era when Marx and Engels founded the communist doctrine, realized in the first salvo of the October Revolution, and solidified in the vigorous development of socialist countries around the world today.

　　However, Feng Xuefeng, who has been a Party member for thirty years, ignores the development of human society and the reality of the lives of people in socialist countries today, and actually says: "Humanity has no hope"!

　　Feng Xuefeng's lament that "humanity has no hope" came precisely when the imperialists manufactured the Hungarian Incident and the American writer Howard Fast defected from the Party. Fast lost confidence in the international communist movement and became pessimistic and wavering about the future of the revolution, which can only be described as a shameful destruction of a writer. Fast's defection did not weaken the high prestige of the Communist Party of America among the American people in the slightest; on the contrary, it made the ranks of the Communist Party of America more pure, more united, and more combat-effective.

　　Feng Xuefeng reached the pessimistic conclusion that "humanity has no hope" from Fast's defection precisely because he and Fast share the same dark heart. Of course, Feng Xuefeng's loss of confidence in the Party's cause and his disregard for the power of the people have his own historical roots. This is because he has been a member of the Chinese Communist Party for thirty years, and for thirty years he has been deviating from the Party and the people, living a snail-like life in damp corners. The Party's sunshine cannot reach his shrunken soft flesh, and the storms of the people's struggle cannot shake his shell.

　　We know that humanity is undergoing unprecedented and tremendous changes. From Pyongyang to East Berlin, from Hanoi to Moscow, nearly two billion pairs of diligent hands are creating the glorious cause of socialism. And this path of development for a new society is precisely the hope of peace-loving people all over the world.

　　Even in the hard years, we also saw the hope of mankind, this hope shines in our hearts. During the Liberation War, we saw women in the Shanxi base area making climbing shoes for the soldiers. They used awls, needles, and thin hemp ropes to densely sew the hope of the Chinese people into the sturdy soles, so that the soldiers could wear them to climb mountains and cross ridges, fight battles, and pave a broad road to happiness for the Chinese people.

　　In the mountainous area bordering Henan and Shaanxi, we saw a female district chief opening her homemade paper notebook from when she joined the guerrillas. The pages were inserted with a needle with thread that she used to sew bloody clothes for her comrades. The rusty needle still had traces of blood, and the short section of white thread was stained with a purplish-black color of blood. And on the two pages holding the needle and thread, there were also faint bloodstains with the same markings. These traces of battle blood are condensed with the firm belief and lofty hope of the Chinese people.

　　After the Chinese people were liberated, during the land reform in Guangdong, I saw a teenager orphan who had suffered all the pain of the old society. When he was grabbing handfuls of filthy black pond mud to cultivate the taro he had planted on the land he had been allocated, his tearful eyes were filled with the joy of hope.

　　In early spring last year, in the Tarim Basin, in order to turn that boundless wilderness into fertile fields, people were building bridges across the icy waters of the Peacock River to open up access for bulldozers, construction vehicles, and tractors. The nearby Uyghur farmers did not hesitate to cut down the poplar trees in their courtyards and transport them with high-wheeled carts to support the construction team in building bridges. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, because the pseudo-county magistrate wanted to build a villa by the river, he ordered the felling of these Uyghur farmers' poplar trees, causing angry resistance. But now, these Uyghur farmers, hoping to change the face of the Tarim wasteland, enthusiastically and personally cut down the poplar trees they had once protected with their lives and voluntarily transported them.

　　From these ordinary yet vivid facts, who can say that humanity has no hope!

　　Humanity's hope is placed in its own hands. They move the stumbling blocks on the road ahead, create a better life, and will continue to create an even better life.

　　Only a small handful of insane imperialists fear the future of mankind, because the forward development of human society is tantamount to a steamroller crushing their reactionary ruling system of plunder, enslavement, arrogance, and tyranny.

　　If we follow Feng Xuefeng's words, only vacillators and traitors who are "kicked aside like a small stone" are pessimistic about the future of mankind. It is only the anti-Party Feng Xuefeng and the traitorous Fast who are "kicked aside like a small stone" and lament "no hope"!

　　Humanity is moving forward with boundless confidence and hope along the inevitable path of social development—socialist society and even communist society. And the flag bearers at the forefront are precisely the vanguards of the working classes of all countries—the Communist Parties.

　　人类的希望
　　碧野
　　人类的希望早已孕育于马克思和恩格斯创立共产主义学说的那个年代，实现于十月革命的第一声炮声中，坚定于全世界社会主义国家蓬勃发展的今天。
    但是有着三十年党龄的冯雪峰，却无视人类社会的发展，无视今天社会主义国家人民的现实生活，竟说：“人类没有希望”！
    冯雪峰悲鸣“人类没有希望”，正是当帝国主义制造匈牙利事件后，美国作家法斯特发生叛党行为的时候。法斯特对国际共产主义丧失信心，对革命前途悲观动摇，只能说是一个作家可耻的毁灭。法斯特的叛党，并没有丝毫削弱美国共产党在美国人民中的崇高威信，相反的是使美国共产党的队伍更加纯洁，更加团结和更加富于战斗力。
    法斯特的叛党行为，使冯雪峰得出“人类没有希望”这一悲观的结论，正是因为他和法斯特有着一颗同样阴暗的心。当然，冯雪峰对党的事业丧失信心，对人民的力量视而无睹，是有他个人的历史根源的。这就是他参加中国共产党三十年，三十年都在背离党，脱离人民，都在阴湿的角落里过着蜗牛式的生活。党的阳光照不到他收缩的软肉，人民斗争的风暴震撼不到他的躯壳。
    我们知道，人类正在经历着史无前例的巨大的变化，从平壤到东柏林，从河内到莫斯科，将近二十亿双勤劳的手，正在创造社会主义光辉的事业。而这种新社会发展的道路，正是全世界爱好和平的人民的希望。
    即使在艰苦的年月里，我们也同样看到人类的希望，这希望在我们的心里发光。在解放战争时期，我们看见山西根据地的妇女在给战士们做爬山鞋，她们把中国人民的希望，用锥子、用针、用细麻绳密密地扎进坚实的鞋底，让战士们穿上它爬山越岭，进行战斗，给中国人民踏出一条幸福翻身的宽广道路。
    在豫陕交界的山区里，我们看见一个女区长打开她参加游击队时的土纸笔记本，纸页上插着她当年给同志们缝补血衣的一根带线的针，生锈的针上仍留有血迹，短短的一截白线留下血染的紫黑色，而在夹着针线的两页纸上还印着同样斑纹的淡淡的血痕。这战斗的血痕凝结着中国人民坚定的信念和崇高的希望。
    当中国人民获得了解放之后，在广东土改期间，我看见一个受尽旧社会痛苦的十几岁的孤儿，当他在分得的田地上，一手一手地抓着污黑的塘泥给种下的鸡爪芋培土的时候，他的含泪的眼睛充满了希望的喜悦。
    去年初春，在塔里木盆地，为了要把那无边的荒原变成万顷良田，人们在孔雀河的雪水冰流里架桥，以便开辟推土机、工程车和拖拉机的通路。附近的维吾尔族农民，不惜把庭院里的穿天杨砍伐了用高轮大车运来，支援工程队架设桥梁。在国民党反动统治年代，因为伪县长要在河边建筑别墅，曾下令采伐这些维吾尔族农民的穿天杨，引起了愤怒的反抗。但是现在，这些维吾尔族农民为了希望改变塔里木荒原的面貌，却热情地亲手伐下他们曾用生命保护过的穿天杨，自动运来了。
    从以上这些平凡而又生动的事看来，谁能说我们人类没有希望！
    人类的希望寄托在自己的双手上，他们搬掷前进道路上的绊脚石，创造着美好的生活，而且将继续创造更美好的生活。
    对人类前途抱畏惧的，只有疯狂的一小撮帝国主义者，因为人类社会的向前发展，无异于压路机将全部压碎他们掠夺奴役和骄横暴虐的反动统治制度。
    对人类前途抱悲观的，如果照冯雪峰的话来说，也只有“像块小石子似的被踢在一旁”的动摇分子和叛徒。“像块小石子似的被踢在一旁”而哀鸣“没有希望”的，仅只是反党的冯雪峰和叛党的法斯特！
    人类是抱着无限的信心和希望在循着社会发展的必然道路——社会主义社会以至共产主义社会前进着的。而走在前面的旗手，正是各国工人阶级的先锋队——共产党。
