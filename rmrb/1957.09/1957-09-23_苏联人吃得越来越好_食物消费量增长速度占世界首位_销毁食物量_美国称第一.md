Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd -- An article published in the Soviet magazine "Kommunist" this year, issue number eleven, stated that in the past fifteen to eighteen years, the Soviet Union has ranked first in the world in terms of the growth rate of people's food consumption.

The article cited statistics to compare the changes in food consumption among people in the Soviet Union and some capitalist countries. Compared to 1937, the growth rates of several major food items consumed by the Soviet people in 1955 were as follows: meat and fats – 77.8%; fish – 62.5%; milk and dairy products – 32.6%; eggs – 107%; sugar – 50%. Comparing 1953 to the average of 1935-1939 in the United States, the consumption of meat and fats increased by 27.5%, fish remained unchanged, milk and dairy products decreased by 11.5%, eggs increased by 31.9%, and sugar remained unchanged. In the United Kingdom, comparing 1953 to the average of 1934-1938, the consumption of meat and fats decreased by 12.3%, fish decreased by 31.3%, milk and dairy products decreased by 23.2%, eggs decreased by 1.5%, and sugar increased by 4.4%. In France, comparing 1953 to the average of 1934-1938, the consumption of meat and fats increased by 11.1%, fish decreased by 33.3%, milk and dairy products increased by 6.8%, eggs increased by 20.1%, and sugar increased by 20.8%.

From these figures, it can be seen that the consumption of all five types of food in the Soviet Union increased, while in the United States, two remained unchanged and one decreased. In the United Kingdom, four decreased, and one only increased slightly. The situation in France was also far inferior to that in the Soviet Union.

According to typical surveys conducted by some industrial departments in the Soviet Union, the food consumption of Soviet worker families increased rapidly after the war. Compared to 1940, the per capita consumption in 1956 increased by 88% for meat and fats, 69% for fish and fish products, doubled for sugar, doubled for milk and dairy products, and increased by 76% for eggs. In collective farmer families, compared to 1940, the per capita consumption in 1956 increased by 63% for meat and fats, 1.4 times for fish and fish products, 48% for milk and dairy products, 3.4 times for sugar, and doubled for eggs. In the composition of residents' food consumption, the proportion of bread decreased somewhat, while the proportion of meat, sugar, milk, vegetables, etc., increased.

The article pointed out that, contrary to the situation in the Soviet Union, the level of food consumption among people in capitalist countries is constantly decreasing. According to official United Nations data, the proportion of the population in the capitalist world suffering from food shortages has increased from 31% in 1939 to 59% in 1955. The American "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" once wrote that four million residents in the United States actually live in hunger.

The article also showed that although the production of many industrial and agricultural products in the United States temporarily ranks first in the world, the United States is not the first in terms of people's consumption levels. For example, the per capita meat consumption in the United States only ranks sixth in the world. However, the United States ranks first in food destruction. In the United States, on the one hand, many people live in hunger, and on the other hand, large amounts of food are destroyed and used to feed livestock.

    苏联人吃得越来越好
    食物消费量增长速度占世界首位
    销毁食物量　美国称第一
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联“共产党人”杂志今年第十一期发表的一篇文章说，在已往的十五年到十八年内，苏联在人民食物消费量的增长速度方面占世界第一位。
    这篇文章引用了统计数字来比较苏联和一些资本主义国家中人民食物消费量的变化情况。以1955年同1937年相比，苏联人民几种主要食品消费量的增长比例如下：肉类和脂肪——77.8％，鱼类——62.5％，牛奶和奶制品——32.6％，鸡蛋——107％，食糖——50％。美国以1953年同1935到1939年的平均数相比，肉类和脂肪的消费量增加27.5％，鱼类不增不减，牛奶和奶制品减少了11.5％，鸡蛋增加31.9％，食糖不增不减。英国以1953年同1934年到1938年的平均数相比，肉类和脂肪的消费量减少了12.3％，鱼类减少了31.3％，牛奶和奶制品减少了23.2％，鸡蛋减少了1.5％，食糖增加了4.4％。法国也以1953年同1934到1938年的平均数相比，肉类和脂肪的消费量增加了11.1％，鱼类减少了33.3％，牛奶和奶制品增加了6.8％，鸡蛋增加了20.1％，食糖增加了20.8％。
    从这些数字可以看出，苏联这五种食物的消费量都在增长，而美国有两种没有增加，一种反而减少。英国四种消费量减少，一种也只是略微增加了一些。法国的情况也远不如苏联。
    根据苏联一些工业部门的典型调查，苏联工人家庭的食物消费量在战后增加很快。以1956年和1940年相比，按人口计算，肉类和脂肪增加了88％，鱼和鱼制品增加了69％，食糖增加了一倍，牛奶和奶制品也增加了一倍，鸡蛋增加了76％。集体农民家庭按人口计算，1956年和1940年相比，肉类和脂肪增加了63％，鱼和鱼制品增加了一点四倍，牛奶和奶制品增加了48％，食糖增加了三点四倍，鸡蛋增加了一倍。在居民食物消费品的组成中，面包的比例有些下降，肉、糖、牛奶、蔬菜等所占的比例提高了。
    文章指出，和苏联的情形相反，资本主义国家人民食物消费量的水平不断降低。根据联合国的官方材料，资本主义世界食物不足的人口在世界总人口中的比例已经从1939年的31％增加到1955年的59％。美国的“圣路易邮报”曾经写道，美国有四百万居民实际上是过着饥饿的生活。
    这篇文章还表明，美国许多工农业产品的生产量暂时还占世界第一位，但是人民消费水平占第一位的却不是美国，例如，美国按人口平均计算的肉类消费量只占世界第六位。在销毁食物方面，美国却占第一位。在美国，一方面许多人过着饥饿的生活，另一方面却大量销毁食物和用食物来喂牲畜。
