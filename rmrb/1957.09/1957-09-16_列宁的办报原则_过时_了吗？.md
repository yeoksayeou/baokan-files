Are Lenin's Principles of Running a Newspaper "Outdated"?
Sha Ying

Lenin once defined newspapers of the Communist Party and socialist countries as follows: "A newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, but also a collective organizer." This definition accurately describes the nature and tasks of our newspapers. During the period of the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, right-wing elements in the journalistic field and some people with revisionist ideas tried, in open or covert ways, to fundamentally overturn Lenin's basic principle. For example, the rightist Fan Sifu said that in the period of socialist construction, Lenin's principle "needs a lot of research," and some past regulations are no longer applicable. Mo Rujian said that Lenin's definition is outdated because Lenin said this in 1901 when the class struggle was very acute, but now we are in a period of peaceful construction, so we cannot mechanically implement this principle. The rightist Wang Zhong talked a lot about the "duality" of newspapers, emphasizing the "commodity nature" of newspapers, but not talking about or rarely talking about newspapers as a tool of class struggle. In addition, many other rightists echoed that this principle is outdated, and if we stick to this principle, it will restrain the enthusiasm of newspaper workers and cannot meet the needs of readers, and so on.

Are Lenin's principles of running a newspaper really outdated?

First of all, according to them, the principle stipulated by Lenin is the principle of running a newspaper during the revolutionary period. Now we are facing the problem of contradictions among the people, and there is no class struggle, so this principle is not applicable. But what is the actual situation in our country now? Our socialist society has not yet been built, the socialist revolution has not yet been completely victorious, the class struggle is still continuing, and even in some times it will take fierce forms. The current anti-rightist struggle is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, a serious and fierce class struggle, and this struggle will be prolonged for a considerable period. In the period of socialist revolution, the contradiction between the people and the bourgeois rightists is a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy, an antagonistic and irreconcilable life-and-death class struggle. Under such circumstances, what is the intention of saying that Lenin's principles of running a newspaper are outdated? That is to ask us to change the nature of newspapers, abandon this tool of class struggle, let the bourgeoisie take it up, and attack the Communist Party and socialism, so that the socialist revolution will fail halfway. Didn't the bourgeois rightists do this during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend? They once took the Wenhui Daily and the Guangming Daily into their hands, and also wanted to seize other newspapers, setting fires and fanning the flames everywhere, as a base for attacking the Party and the people. Isn't this reason, this lesson, clear?

Secondly, according to them, in the period of socialist construction, Lenin's principle is not applicable. Is this really the case? We believe that Lenin's principle of running a newspaper is not only suitable for the revolutionary period, but also suitable for the construction period. In the revolutionary period, it is necessary to run newspapers and use this powerful tool to carry out propaganda, agitation, and organization work among the masses, and lead them to carry out revolutionary struggles, overthrow the reactionary regime, and establish a socialist system. In the construction period, we also need to use newspapers to carry out propaganda, agitation, and organization work among the masses, and use it as a tool for building socialism. For example, why do we want to build socialism, how to build socialism, what are the Party's policies, what are our achievements and experiences, what are our difficulties and shortcomings, and how should these difficulties and shortcomings be overcome, etc., all need to be publicized and educated to the masses, so as to improve their ideological and political consciousness and stimulate their enthusiasm and creativity for construction, in order to accelerate the progress of socialist construction. Please see what Lenin said in his famous article "On the Nature of Our Newspapers" written in September 1918: "There is too little coverage of various facts in the construction of new life... We rarely use vivid and concrete examples from life to educate the masses, which is the main task of the press in the transition from capitalism to socialism. We rarely pay attention to the daily life inside factories, rural areas, and troops, and there are the most fresh things, the most need to pay attention to, publicize, and social criticism, the most need to accuse bad people and bad things, and call on people to learn from good people and good things."

Don't these words of Lenin powerfully illustrate the role of newspapers in socialist construction? How can we say that Lenin's principles of running a newspaper are outdated?

Of course, to implement Lenin's principles of running a newspaper and learn from the Soviet Union's experience in running a newspaper, we must combine it with the specific conditions of our country and use it flexibly, and we cannot mechanically copy it; at the same time, we must also summarize and absorb the historical experience of our country's newspapers, especially the experience of running newspapers in our liberated areas and the experience of running newspapers since liberation, so as to enrich and develop Lenin's theory of journalism. And we must give full play to creativity and actively improve our newspapers so that they can serve socialist construction. But we must never say that Lenin's principles of running a newspaper are outdated. If we say that Lenin's principles of running a newspaper are outdated, then what principles should we use to run newspapers now? The rightists and some people with revisionist ideas are trying to replace Lenin's principles of running a newspaper with the bourgeois principles of running a newspaper by attacking Lenin's principles of running a newspaper.

What are the bourgeois principles of running a newspaper? No matter how the bourgeois newspapers claim to be "classless," claiming that their reports are "objective" and "fair," and vigorously touting that the bourgeois publications and news are "free," etc., these deceptive banners cannot cover up its essence. Bourgeois newspapers serve the interests of the bourgeoisie, defend the capitalist system, and are also tools for deceiving and enslaving the working people, opposing the Soviet Union, opposing the Communist Party, and opposing progressive causes. In capitalist countries, printing plants and the entire publishing and distribution industry are controlled by the bourgeoisie. Only the bourgeoisie has freedom of the press, and the broad working people cannot talk about freedom of the press at all. As early as 1921, Lenin pointed out: "The bourgeoisie has turned newspapers into capitalist enterprises, into tools for the rich to make money, obtain information, and seek pleasure, and into tools for deceiving and fooling the working masses." Now the rightists are maliciously slandering our Party newspapers, denying the achievements of our news work; on the other hand, they are conspiring to usurp the leadership of some newspapers, and wantonly promoting bourgeois news viewpoints. They believe that our propaganda of Marxism-Leninism in the newspapers is "a piece of dogmatism"; our propaganda of the Party and the government's policies is "really like drawing symbols and chanting spells"; our propaganda of socialist economic construction is "a piece of machine sound"; our criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers are "full of accusations." We emphasize the Party spirit and class nature of newspapers, and at the same time believe that Party spirit and the people's nature are consistent, and Party spirit is the highest and most concentrated expression of the people's nature; but they deny the Party spirit of newspapers under the guise of enhancing the people's nature, thereby also denying the people's nature of newspapers. We emphasize the guiding role of newspapers, but also advocate making newspapers rich and colorful, lively and vivid; but they one-sidedly emphasize the interest and "comfort" and "commodity" of newspapers to dilute the ideology and guidance of newspapers. We emphasize that technology should serve politics, and believe that political issues are primary and technical issues are subordinate, but at the same time we do not despise technical issues and constantly strive to improve the layout technology of newspapers; but they say that "Party newspapers have no skills" and "Party newspapers are like a widow's face," emphasizing "technology first," believing that politics should be subordinate to technology, and vigorously flaunting their newspaper skills to cover up their reactionary political purposes. We emphasize strengthening the Party's leadership over newspapers, and believe that the Party's leadership is the basic condition for running socialist newspapers well; but they simply promote bourgeois liberalism, oppose the Party's leadership over the news industry, and attempt to seize the leadership of the news industry. The matter is very clear. Our argument with them is by no means an academic issue or a technical issue, but a fundamental issue of stand and line. They stand on the position of the bourgeoisie, want to overthrow Lenin's principles of running a newspaper, want to change the socialist political direction of our news industry, and lead our news industry to the bourgeois political direction, as a tool for them to oppose the Communist Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism, to engage in the restoration of capitalism. This is absolutely intolerable to us and must be thoroughly exposed and criticized. This is a serious struggle on the news front. If they achieve their goals, it will not only be a matter of the newspapers themselves, nor just a matter of the news industry, but a matter of the entire cause of the Party and the people.

Now, we want to solemnly tell the rightists and some people with revisionist ideas that what is really outdated is not Lenin's principles of running a newspaper, but the bourgeois principles of running a newspaper. Because newspapers are a superstructure, it reflects the social existence. The development history of the press is a reflection of the history of social development. The law of social development is that socialist society replaces capitalist society. Now capitalism is long outdated, and socialism is like the rising sun, a new, rational, and most vital social system. The law of press development is also like this. The proletarian press must replace the bourgeois press. Although some bourgeois newspapers in some countries still have a certain progressiveness, on the whole, the bourgeois newspapers in today's world are decadent, and the bourgeois principles of running a newspaper are reactionary; and the proletarian newspapers represent the interests of the most advanced class and the broad working people, and are therefore the most revolutionary, and the proletarian principles of running a newspaper are the most scientific. You say that Lenin's principles of running a newspaper are outdated because you do not understand the laws of press development. Our country is a socialist country, and the newspapers of our country are a reflection of the socialist economy, that is, the planned economy on the basis of public ownership, through news means. In capitalist society, newspapers are a reflection of the anarchic and group competitive economy through news means. Now that our social foundation has been fundamentally changed and the public ownership of the means of production has occupied a dominant position, it means that the newspapers representing the bourgeois direction have lost their foundation and there is no possibility of existence, and the bourgeois principles of running a newspaper can no longer survive. The so-called "if the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to" means this. Although the rightists are always thinking about old things and trying their best to smuggle in private goods, they can't escape the eyes of the Party and the people. Now it has been completely exposed in its ugly form.

We should also learn a big lesson from this anti-rightist struggle in the news industry. The bourgeois rightists vainly attempt to fundamentally negate Lenin's principles of running a newspaper ideologically, and confuse the thinking and team of our news workers; fundamentally change the socialist direction of our country's news industry politically, and lead our news industry to the bourgeois political direction; fundamentally oppose the leadership of the Party and the state over the news industry organizationally, in order to further seize the position of our country's news industry. To this end, we must consolidate the Party's leadership over the news industry (especially ideological and political leadership), defend Lenin's principles of running a newspaper, adhere to the socialist direction of newspapers, strengthen the Party spirit and class nature of newspapers, improve the guiding role of newspapers, enrich the content of newspapers, improve the style of writing and layout of newspapers, so that it can fully play the role of collective propagandist, agitator, and organizer, and truly become the most powerful and sharp weapon of class struggle and building socialism. As for every news worker, they should also learn a lesson from this anti-rightist struggle. Only by firmly standing on the position of the working class, consciously accepting the leadership of the Party, strengthening political and ideological training, and striving to study Marxism-Leninism and proletarian news theory, can we not be confused by all kinds of bourgeois news viewpoints and lose our direction, and can resolutely fight them, defend the position of our news industry, and better serve socialism.

　　列宁的办报原则“过时”了吗？
　　沙英
    列宁曾经对共产党和社会主义国家的报刊下了这样一个定义：“报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且还是集体的组织者。”这个定义确切地说明了我们的报纸的性质和任务。新闻界的右派分子和一些抱有修正主义思想的人，在大鸣大放期间，以公开的或隐蔽的方式，极力想从根本上推翻列宁的这个基本原则。例如右派分子范四夫说：在社会主义建设时期，列宁的这个原则“大有研究的必要”，过去的一些规定就不适用了。莫如俭说：列宁的这个定义过时了，因为这个定义是列宁在1901年讲的，那时的阶级斗争很尖锐，可是现在我们是和平建设时期，就不能机械地执行这个原则了。右派分子王中大谈其报纸的“两重性”，强调报纸的“商品性”，而不谈或很少谈报纸作为阶级斗争的工具。此外，还有许多右派分子都异口同调地说，这个原则过时了，如果老坚持这个原则，那就束缚了办报人的积极性，不能满足读者的要求了，等等。
    列宁的办报原则真的过时了吗？
    首先，按照他们的说法，列宁规定的这个原则，是革命时期办报的原则，现在我们面临的是人民内部矛盾问题，没有阶级斗争了，所以这个原则就不适用了。但是我国现在的实际情况是怎样的呢？我们的社会主义社会还未建成，社会主义革命还未彻底胜利，阶级斗争还是继续着，甚至在某些时候还会采取激烈的形式。目前所进行的反右派斗争，正是在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，正是一场严重的激烈的阶级斗争，而且这个斗争还要延长相当长的时期。在社会主义革命时期，人民和资产阶级右派的矛盾是敌我矛盾，是对抗性的不可调和的你死我活的阶级斗争。在这样的情况下面，说列宁的办报原则过时了，究竟居心何在呢？那就是要我们改变报纸的性质，放弃这个阶级斗争的工具，让资产阶级把它拿起来，向共产党向社会主义进攻，使社会主义革命中途失败。在大鸣大放时期，资产阶级右派不就是这样做的吗？他们一度把文汇报和光明日报拿到了手中，而且还想夺取别的报纸，到处放火煽风，作为向党向人民进攻的阵地。这种道理，这种教训，难道不是明明白白的吗？
    其次，按照他们的说法，在社会主义建设时期，列宁的这个原则不适用了。真是这样吗？我们认为，列宁的这个办报原则，不仅适合于革命时期，而且也适合于建设时期。在革命时期要办报，要用报纸这个有力的工具，对群众进行宣传、鼓动和组织工作，领导他们进行革命斗争，推翻反动的政权，建立社会主义制度。在建设时期，我们同样要利用报纸，向群众进行宣传、鼓动和组织工作，把它作为建设社会主义的工具。譬如说，我们为什么要建设社会主义，怎样建设社会主义，党的方针政策是什么，我们有些什么成绩和经验，有些什么困难和缺点，这些困难和缺点应当怎样克服，等等，都要向群众进行宣传教育，从而提高他们的思想和政治觉悟，激起他们建设的热情和创造性，以加速社会主义建设事业的进展。请看列宁在1918年9月写的“论我们报纸的性质”这一篇著名的论文中说道：“新生活建设方面种种事实的报道，占的篇幅太少了……我们很少用生活中的生动的具体事例来教育群众，而这却是报刊在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的主要任务。我们很少注意工厂、农村和部队内部的日常生活，而这方面新鲜事物最多，最需要注意、宣扬和社会批评，最需要指责坏人坏事，号召向好人好事学习。”
    列宁的这些话，难道不是有力地说明了报纸在社会主义建设中的作用吗？怎么能说列宁的办报原则过时了呢？
    当然，执行列宁的办报原则，学习苏联的办报经验，要和我国的具体情况结合起来，灵活地运用，而不能机械地搬运；同时也要对于我国报刊的历史经验加以总结和吸收，特别是我们解放区的办报经验和解放以来的办报经验，更要加以总结和吸收，从而日益丰富和发展列宁的新闻学说。并且要充分发挥创造性，积极改进我们的报纸，使它为社会主义建设服务。但是绝对不能说列宁的办报原则已经过时了。如果说列宁的办报原则过时了，那么我们现在要用什么原则来办报呢？右派分子和一些抱有修正主义思想的人，所以极力攻击列宁的办报原则，就是妄想以资产阶级的办报原则来代替列宁的办报原则。
    资产阶级的办报原则是什么呢？不管资产阶级报刊怎样自称是“无阶级性的”，扬言它的报道是“客观的”“公正的”，并极力吹嘘资产阶级的出版和新闻是“自由的”等等，但是这些骗人的幌子并不能掩盖它的实质，资产阶级的报刊是为资产阶级利益服务的，是为资本主义制度辩护的，同时也是欺骗和奴役劳动人民的，反苏、反共和反对进步事业的工具。在资本主义国家中，印刷厂及整个出版发行事业，都操在资产阶级手中，只有资产阶级的新闻自由，而广大劳动人民是根本谈不到什么新闻自由的。列宁早在1921年时就曾指出：“资产阶级使报纸成了资本主义企业，成了富人发财致富、获取情报和寻开心的工具，成了欺骗和愚弄劳动大众的工具。”现在右派分子一方面在恶毒地诽谤我们的党报，否定我们新闻工作的成绩；一方面阴谋篡夺某些报纸的领导权，尽情地宣扬资产阶级的新闻观点。我们在报上宣传马克思列宁主义，他们认为是“一片教条主义”；我们宣传党和政府的方针政策，他们说是“真像画符念咒”；我们宣传社会主义经济建设，他们说是“一片机器声”，我们在报上进行批评与自我批评，他们说是“满纸斥责声”。我们强调报纸的党性和阶级性，同时认为党性和人民性是一致的，党性是人民性的最高最集中的表现；可是他们在增强人民性的幌子下否定报纸的党性，从而也否定了报纸的人民性。我们强调报纸的指导性，但同时也主张把报纸办得丰富多采，生动活泼；可是他们片面地强调报纸的趣味性和什么“舒服性”、“商品性”，来冲淡报纸的思想性和指导性。我们强调技术应服从政治，认为政治性的问题是首要的，技术性的问题是附属的，但同时也不轻视技术问题，而且不断地努力改进报纸的编排技术；可是他们却说“党报没有技巧”、“党报是一副寡妇脸”，强调“技术第一”，认为政治应服从于技术，并极力炫耀他们的办报技巧，来掩盖他们反动的政治目的。我们强调加强党对于报纸的领导，认为党的领导是社会主义报纸办好的基本条件；可是他们却一味宣扬资产阶级的自由主义，反对党对于新闻事业的领导，妄图夺取新闻事业的领导权。事情就是很明显的，我们和他们的论争，这决不是什么学术问题和技巧问题，而是根本的立场问题和路线问题。他们站在资产阶级的立场上，要推翻列宁的办报原则，要改变我们新闻事业的社会主义政治方向，而把我们的新闻事业引向资产阶级的政治方向，作为他们反共、反人民和反社会主义的工具，来从事资本主义复辟的勾当。这是我们绝对不能容许的，必须加以彻底地揭露和批判。这是新闻战线上一场严重的斗争。如果他们达到了目的，那将不只是报纸的本身问题，也不只是新闻界的问题，而是关系到整个党和人民的事业的问题。
    现在，我们要严正地告诉右派分子和一些抱有修正主义思想的人们，真正过时了的，并不是列宁的办报原则，而是资产阶级的办报原则。因为报纸是一种上层建筑，它是反映社会存在的。报刊的发展史是社会发展史的反映。社会发展史的规律，是社会主义社会代替资本主义社会。现在资本主义是早已过时了，而社会主义则有如旭日东升，是新兴的合理的最富有生命力的社会制度。报刊发展的规律也是这样，无产阶级的报刊要代替资产阶级的报刊。虽然现在有些国家的少数资产阶级报刊，还有一定的进步性，但就整个来说，当今世界上的资产阶级报刊是腐朽的，资产阶级的办报原则是反动的；而无产阶级的报刊是代表最先进的阶级和广大劳动人民的利益的，因而是最革命的，无产阶级的办报原则是最科学的。你们说列宁的办报原则过时了，是你们不懂得报刊的发展规律。我们的国家是社会主义国家，我们国家的报纸，是社会主义经济即在公有制基础上的计划经济通过新闻手段的反映。而在资本主义社会中，报纸是无政府状态的和集团竞争的经济通过新闻手段的反映。现在既然我们的社会基础已经根本改变了，生产资料公有制已占统治地位，那就是代表资产阶级方向的报纸已经失去基础而没有存在的可能了，资产阶级的办报原则已经无法生存了。所谓“皮之不存，毛将焉附”就是这个意思。右派分子虽然念念不忘旧物，并想尽办法，借尸还魂，偷运私货，但总是逃不出党和人民的眼睛，现在它已经丑态百出，原形毕露了。
    我们从这次新闻界反右派斗争中还应该得到一个大教训。资产阶级右派妄想从思想上根本否定列宁的办报原则，搅乱我们新闻工作者的思想和队伍；从政治上根本改变我国新闻事业的社会主义方向，而把我们的新闻事业引向资产阶级的政治方向；从组织上根本反对党和国家对新闻事业的领导，以便进一步地夺取我国新闻事业的阵地。为此，今后我们就要巩固党对于新闻事业的领导（特别是思想上和政治上的领导），保卫列宁的办报原则，坚持报纸的社会主义方向，加强报纸的党性和阶级性，提高报纸的指导性，充实报纸的内容，改进报纸的文风和编排，使它充分发挥集体的宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的作用，而真正成为阶级斗争和建设社会主义最有力最锐利的武器。至于对每一个新闻工作者来说，也应当从这次反右派斗争中吸取教训。我们只有坚定地站在工人阶级立场上，自觉地接受党的领导，加强政治思想上的锻炼，努力学习马克思列宁主义和无产阶级的新闻理论，才能不致为形形色色的资产阶级新闻观点所迷惑而失掉方向，并能坚决地和它们作斗争，捍卫我们新闻事业的阵地，更好地为社会主义服务。
