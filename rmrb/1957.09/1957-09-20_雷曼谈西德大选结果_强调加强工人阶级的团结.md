Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 19th: According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur report, German Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Lehmann delivered a speech on the "German 904 Free Radio Station" on the 18th regarding the West German election results.

　　Lehmann emphasized that a major conclusion to be drawn from the Federal Parliament election results is that the struggle to win the unity of the working class must be strengthened, and one must be faithful to the goals and ideals of the workers' movement. Lehmann said that if the nine million voters who voted for the Social Democratic Party (including communist, social democratic or Christian workers, intellectuals, and all those opposed to the Adenauer regime) could unite and launch a large-scale popular movement to oppose rearmament and militarism, fight for peace, democracy, social progress, and restore German unity, it would be a tremendous force.

　　Lehmann pointed out that it is necessary to turn the German Social Democratic Party onto the path of opposing monopoly capitalists and militarists, onto the path of concerted action by the entire German working class, and onto the path of achieving mutual understanding between the two Germanys.

　　Lehmann finally emphasized that the current task is to strengthen cooperation between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. This cooperation has already laid the foundation during the election campaign.

　　雷曼谈西德大选结果
　　强调加强工人阶级的团结
    新华社柏林19日电　据德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央第一书记雷曼18日在“德国九○四自由广播电台”就西德选举结果发表演说。
    雷曼强调指出，从联邦议院选举结果得出的一个主要结论是，必须加强斗争来争取工人阶级的团结一致，必须忠实于工人运动的目的和理想。雷曼说，如果投票选举社会民主党的九百万选民（其中包括共产党、社会民主党或基督徒的工人、知识分子和一切反对阿登纳制度的人）能够联合起来发动声势浩大的人民运动，以反对重新武装和军国主义，争取和平、民主、社会进步和恢复德国统一，那将是一支巨大的力量。
    雷曼指出，必须使德国社会民主党转到反对垄断资本家和军国主义者的道路上来，转到全体德国工人阶级一致行动的道路上来，转到使两个德国达成互相谅解的道路上来。
    雷曼最后强调指出，现在的任务是要加强共产党和社会民主党之间的合作。这种合作在竞选过程中已经打下了基础。
