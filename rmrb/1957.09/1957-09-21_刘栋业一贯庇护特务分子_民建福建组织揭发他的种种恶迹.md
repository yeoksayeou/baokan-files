The Minjian (China National Democratic Construction Association) Fujian Provincial Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Committee, in the course of the anti-Rightist struggle, jointly held nine enlarged meetings, comprehensively exposing and criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of Liu Dongye, a member of the Minjian Central Committee, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Working Committee, and a Rightist.

At the start of the rectification campaign, Liu Dongye launched a frantic attack on the Party. He viciously slandered the Party's cadre policy as "emphasizing politics over talent," saying that the Party's personnel arrangements did not achieve "knowing people and assigning them appropriately." He openly put forward his personnel arrangement principle: "Those with virtue should be given official positions, and those with merit should be given rewards."

Liu Dongye once slandered the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, saying, "They have swept away all sense of right and wrong, justice, integrity, and rationality."

Under Liu Dongye's control, the Minjian Fujian organization experienced malignant development. As early as 1951, Liu Dongye pulled special agent Xiao Yijian, counter-revolutionary Huang Qihua, Huang Qingsong, and illegal capitalist Cai Youlan into the association. He handed over the organizational work of Minjian Fujian at that time to special agent Xiao Yijian, developing a large number of people with unclear backgrounds, attempting to increase his political capital to resist the leadership of the Party.

Liu Dongye's anti-Communist, anti-People, and anti-socialist stance has a consistent historical origin. In 1919, when Liu Dongye was studying in France, he colluded with Zeng Qi and Lin Keji, heads of the reactionary Youth Party, and joined the reactionary Youth Party, becoming a core member. Shortly after returning to China, he became the Major General Director of the Second Paint Factory of the Third War Zone of the Kuomintang. During his tenure, he ruthlessly exploited the workers. The day before the liberation of Fuzhou, he released the special agent Liu Chongfeng who was living in his house, and continued to collude with special agents such as Lin Junyang after liberation. In 1951, when Liu Dongye was the Chairman of the Fuzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, he again used his position to re-employ a group of special agents, appointing special agent Xiao Yijian as the Deputy Secretary-General of the Fuzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce. When the special agent Lin Junyang was suppressed and Xiao Yijian committed suicide out of fear of punishment, Liu Dongye expressed great regret. At a joint meeting of Minjian members, he specially took out the will of the special agent Xiao Yijian, read it aloud in public, and expressed that he would take good care of his family.

### 刘栋业一贯庇护特务分子  民建福建组织揭发他的种种恶迹

    刘栋业一贯庇护特务分子
    民建福建组织揭发他的种种恶迹
    本报讯　民主建国会福建省委和福州市委在反右派斗争中，先后联合举行过九次扩大会议，全面地揭露和批判民建中央委员、福建省工委主委、右派分子刘栋业的反动言行。
    整风开始，刘栋业即疯狂地向党发起了进攻。他恶毒地污蔑党的干部政策是“重政治不重才干”，说党的人事安排没有做到“知人善任”。他公开提出了他的人事安排原则是“德懋懋官，功懋懋赏”。
    刘栋业曾污蔑三反、五反运动说：“已使是非、公道、廉耻、理性一扫而空”。
    在刘栋业的把持下，民建福建组织实行了恶性大发展。早在1951年，刘栋业就把特务分子萧一健、反革命分子黄其华、黄青松及不法的资本家蔡友兰等拉进会内，并把当时民建福建的组织工作交给特务分子萧一健去经营，大量发展面目不清的人，企图增加他的政治资本，来抗拒党的领导。
    刘栋业反共反人民反社会主义是有其一贯的历史根源的。1919年刘栋业在法国留学时，就与反动青年党头子曾琦、林可机等勾结在一起，并参加反动青年党，成为中坚分子。回国后不久，他就当上了国民党第三战区第二颜料厂的少将厂长，在任期间，大肆压榨工人。福州解放前一天，他放走了住在他家里的特务分子刘崇丰，解放后仍与特务分子林君扬等勾结。在1951年刘栋业任福州市工商联主委时期，他又利用职权，重新重用一批特务分子，把特务分子萧一健委为福州市工商业联合会副秘书长。当特务分子林君扬被镇压，萧一健畏罪自杀后，刘栋业表示非常惋惜。他在民建会员联组会上特地拿出特务分子萧一健的遗嘱，当众宣读，表示要好好照顾他的家属。
