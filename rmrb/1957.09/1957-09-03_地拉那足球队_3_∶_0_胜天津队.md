Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 1st. The Albanian Tirana football team defeated the Tianjin football team in Tianjin today by a score of 3-0.
    In the first twenty minutes of today's match, the Tianjin team attacked many times, but the visiting team defended tightly with zonal defense and man-to-man tactics. Several shots by the Tianjin team were inaccurate, and as a result, they did not score a single goal. After twenty minutes, the visiting team launched a counterattack with flexible and varied tactics. Left inside forward Lesnia scored two goals in succession from about four meters in front of the Tianjin team's goal.
    As the game progressed to the final few minutes, the Tianjin team's offensive weakened further, and the players adopted long passes, making many mistakes. The visiting team's center forward took the opportunity to score another goal.
    The Tirana football team arrived in Tianjin on August 31 and will soon visit Shanghai.

    地拉那足球队3∶0胜天津队
    新华社天津1日电  阿尔巴尼亚地拉那足球队今天在天津以三比○战胜了天津足球队。
    天津队在今天比赛的最初的二十分钟内多次进攻，但是客队以区域联防和人盯人的战术严密防守，天津队几次射门不准，结果一球未进。二十分钟后，客队以灵活多变的战术开始了反攻，左内锋列斯尼亚在天津队门前约四公尺处先后射进了两球。
    球赛进行到最后几分钟，天津队的攻势更加减弱，队员采用长传，失误很多，客队中锋又乘机射入了一球。
    地拉那足球队是8月31日到达天津的，他们即将去上海访问。
