　　Listening to a Solo Recital by the Famous Soviet Singer

　　In my life, I will never forget the days when I studied at the Moscow State Conservatory. I remember those years when so many evenings were spent in the halls or small halls of the conservatory. At that time, I listened with a thirsty heart to the outstanding performances of the best Soviet and foreign singers and performers. The famous pianist Richter and the singer Dolliak were the two musicians who were particularly welcomed and loved by the audience. Recently, these two outstanding Soviet musicians were invited to perform in our country, which allowed me to hear the superb art performances that I had loved for a long time. This is really a happy thing!
　　In Beijing, Richter held two solo concerts, and Dolliak held one solo recital, both of which were warmly welcomed by the audience. Richter is more familiar to us, because everyone has already recognized his artistic talent from the movie "Glinka" (he played Liszt). However, this was Dolliak's first time meeting the audience in China.
　　Nina Dolliak is a vocal professor at the Moscow State Conservatory. Her singing is renowned both in the Soviet Union and abroad. She is a singer with a unique style, specializing in performing chamber music. No matter the era or creative style of the works, she can grasp them very completely. She once performed many arias from Bach's cantata oratorios (accompanied by the famous Soviet organist Professor Gedyke), and received the highest praise and evaluation. She used a beautiful, soft, and moving voice to sing Weckerlin's works; and with poetic and simple expressions, she sang the works of Mozart, Schubert, and Schumann, which caused a sensation in the Moscow music scene. The entire program content of her solo recitals is often the works of one composer, such as Schubert's "Winterreise," "Die schöne Müllerin," Schumann's "Dichterliebe," "Frauenliebe und -leben," etc. In addition, she has also held French works recitals, performing Debussy and Ravel's lyrical songs (sung in French). She carefully selects the programs she performs, and conducts meticulous research on each different style of work, using her singing to interpret the songs, so that many Western European classical works that are rarely performed and have been forgotten are once again transmitted to the depths of the hearts of the vast audience.
　　Dolliak is also one of the people who introduces Russian works, especially Russian lyrical songs, the most. From the oldest songs, such as the works of Gurilev, Varlamov, Vielgorsky, etc., are also exceptionally arranged in her concert programs, but she sings Glinka's works the most. There are many extremely small and simple songs that, after hearing her sing, make people feel how rich in poetry and truly moving emotions they contain. "I remember a wonderful moment" and "Venetian Night" are prominent examples.
　　Dolliak is not only good at mastering the singing of poetic songs, but also can prominently express Tchaikovsky's style. For example, "None but the Lonely Heart" which she sang in this recital is an example. In this song, she typically grasps Tchaikovsky's main styles: cordiality, simplicity, melancholy, and inner excitement, using the changes in timbre and poetic language to vividly express a person's melancholy recollection of his life and past love.
　　In addition, the two songs "I Opened the Window" and "Lullaby" sung by Dolliak, expressed inner sentiments full of fantasy and hope. She sang with such a sense of life, that although the Russian language has a certain distance for the Chinese audience, it deeply touched the heartstrings of the audience.
　　Dolliak's expressiveness is amazing. In Moscow, she caused a sensation in Soviet cities because she first sang Shostakovich's new work "Jewish Folk Poetry." Prokofiev's "The Ugly Duckling," since she first sang it, no one else has sung this suite until now. Everyone knows that Mussorgsky's "The Nursery" is a very difficult work to sing, but she created innocent, lively, and mischievous children's images with true life-likeness. When she sings, the timbre changes with the special intonation of the children, sometimes happy, sometimes scared, innocent and unrestrained. Although the songs express the lives of children and adults, the audience is captivated.
　　This time, the last program she sang was "Children's Holiday" written by the French Debussy. This work was written during World War I and was sung by children. The content tells the story of how the enemies burned their homes and schools, and they had no bread or toys, but they believed that they would definitely win. They suffered disasters in their lives, they lost their happy homes and schools, and the war brought them disasters, but they were unwilling to live like this, hoping for victory and believing in the days of peace. In this song, Dolliak showed how firm the children's innocent hearts were wounded and their confidence in the imminent arrival of peace.
　　I will never forget this outstanding solo recital. Dolliak has left us with a very deep impression in terms of creative attitude and method. She has given our singers a very clear and excellent demonstration.

　　听苏联著名歌唱家
　　多尔利阿克的独唱会
　　郑兴丽
    在我的生活当中，我永远忘不了在莫斯科国立音乐院学习的日子。记得在那些年代里，多少个夜晚都是在音乐院的大厅或是小厅里面度过的。当时怀着如饥如渴的心情倾听着苏联的和外国的最优秀的歌唱家与演奏家的杰出表演。著名的钢琴家李赫特尔和歌唱家多尔利阿克便是被观众所特别欢迎和热爱的两位音乐家。最近这两位苏联杰出的音乐家应邀来我国演出，使我重又听到久所热爱的高超艺术的演出，这实在是一件幸福的事！
    在北京，李赫特尔举行了两次独奏会，多尔利阿克举行了一次独唱会，都受到了听众热烈的欢迎。李赫特尔是我们比较熟悉的，因为大家早从电影“格林卡”中认识了他的艺术才能（他扮演李斯特）。而多尔利阿克在中国和听众见面还是第一次。
    尼娜·多尔利阿克是莫斯科国立音乐院的声乐教授，她的演唱，在苏联和国外都是享有盛名的。她是一位具有独特风格，专门演唱室内乐的歌唱家。无论不同时代和不同创作风格的作品，她都能非常完整地掌握它们。她曾经演出过巴哈的清唱圣剧中许多咏叹调（由苏联著名的管风琴演奏家葛地克教授伴奏），获得了最高的赞扬和评价。她用优美的柔和动人的声音，演唱过魏克尔林的作品；以富有诗意和朴素的表现，唱出了轰动莫斯科音乐界的莫托尔特、舒伯特和舒曼的作品。她的独唱音乐的整个节目内容往往就是一个作曲家的作品，如舒伯特的“冬之旅”、“美丽的磨坊女郎”，舒曼的“诗人之恋”、“女人的爱情和生活”等。此外，她还举行过法国作品独唱会，表演了德比西和拉维尔德法的抒情歌曲（用法文演唱）。她对于自己演出的节目是精心挑选的，对于每一种不同风格的作品都先作精细的研究，用自己的歌唱来解释所唱的歌曲，使许多很少被人演出和被遗忘了的西欧古典作品，重新又传达到了广大听众的心之深处。
    多尔利阿克对于俄罗斯的作品，特别是俄罗斯的抒情歌曲也是介绍得最多的一位。从最古老的歌曲，如古里列夫、瓦尔拉莫夫、维耶里哥尔斯基等人的作品，也破例地排列在她的音乐会的节目中，但她唱得最多是格林卡的作品。有许多极小而又简单的歌曲，当听到她唱之后，使人感到其中有着多么丰富的诗意，真实动人的情感。“那美妙的瞬间”和“威尼斯之夜”便是显著的例子。
    多尔利阿克不仅善于掌握诗意的歌曲演唱，也能把柴可夫斯基的风格突出地表现出来。如这次独唱会中她唱的“狂欢之夜”，就是一个例子。她在这支歌曲中典型地掌握了柴可夫斯基的主要风格：亲切、纯朴、忧郁和内心的激动，从音色的变化和诗意的语言，把一个人忧郁地回忆自己的生活和过去的爱情的心情生动地表达出来。
    此外，多尔利阿克唱的：“我打开窗子”和“摇篮曲”这两首歌，表现了充满幻想和希望的内心倾诉。她唱得这样有生活气息，虽然俄文语言对于中国观众有一定距离，但却深深地打动了听众的心弦。
    多尔利阿克的表现力是惊人的。在莫斯科，她曾因初唱萧斯塔科维奇的新作品“犹太音诗”而轰动苏联各城市。普罗科菲耶夫的“丑小鸭”，自从她初次演唱之后，直到现在还没有第二个人唱过这支组曲。大家都知道，莫索尔斯基的“儿童歌曲集”，是非常难唱的作品，但她以真实的生活性，创造出了天真活泼而又调皮的儿童形象。当她演唱时，随着儿童的特殊语调，音色也随着在变化，一会儿高兴，一会儿害怕，天真烂漫，虽然歌曲中所表现的是儿童和大人们生活中的事，但听众却被迷住了。
    这次，她演唱的最后一个节目是法国德比西写的“流浪儿童的节日”。这个作品写于第一次世界大战时期，由儿童们演唱的。内容是讲述敌人烧了他们的家和学校，没有了面包和玩具，但是他们相信一定会胜利。他们在生活上受到了灾害，他们失去了幸福的家和学校，战争给他们带来了灾害，但他们不愿意这样生活下去，盼望胜利、相信和平的日子。多尔利阿克在这支歌曲中表现了孩子无辜的心灵上的创伤，对和平即将来到的信心，是多么坚定。
    我永远不能忘记这次杰出的独唱音乐会。多尔利阿克在创作态度及方法上，留给了我们非常深刻的印象，她给予了我们歌唱家们一个极明确和优秀的示范。
