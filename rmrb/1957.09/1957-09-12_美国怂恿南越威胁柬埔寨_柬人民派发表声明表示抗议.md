Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 11th. According to the "People's Daily," the Cambodian People's Faction on the 10th strongly protested against South Vietnam, aided by U.S. imperialism, for strengthening its forces along the Cambodian border, violating the Geneva Accords, and threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

In a statement signed by Secretary-General Long Song, the People's Faction pointed out that the U.S. imperialists colluded with the South Vietnamese regime, shipped many weapons to South Vietnam, sent a large number of American military advisors to South Vietnam, and established numerous military institutions there. South Vietnam, taking advantage of this U.S. assistance, has continuously increased its forces on the Cambodian border, ignoring the repeated protests from the Cambodian government and people. This action seriously threatens Cambodia's independence and endangers peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The United States and South Vietnam must be held responsible for this situation.

　　美国怂恿南越威胁柬埔寨
　　柬人民派发表声明表示抗议
    据新华社金边11日电　据“人民报”报道，柬埔寨人民派10日强烈抗议南越在美帝国主义帮助下在柬埔寨边界一带加强兵力、破坏日内瓦协议和威胁印度支那和东南亚和平的做法。
    人民派在总书记龙松签署的声明中指出，美帝国主义者勾结南越政权，运给南越很多武器，派了大量美国军事顾问到南越去，并且在那里设立了许许多多的军事机构。南越利用美国的这种援助，不断地在柬埔寨边界上增强兵力，不理会柬埔寨政府和人民一再提出的抗议。这种行动严重地威胁柬埔寨的独立，危及印度支那和东南亚的和平。美国和南越必须对这种情况负责。
