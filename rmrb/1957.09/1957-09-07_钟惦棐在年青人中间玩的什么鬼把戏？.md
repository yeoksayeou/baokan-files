The anti-Party element in the film industry, Zhong Dianfei, has always styled himself as a "good teacher and helpful friend" to young people. Even in the recent criticism meeting where he made a self-criticism, he still claimed that his relationship with young people was normal, and that he had even been of some help to them in his interactions with them. However, the facts prove that this is complete nonsense. The reason he was so keen on approaching young people, inviting this one to his home for a chat, and writing a letter to that one, was entirely for ulterior motives.

Now, let's take a look at what tricks Zhong Dianfei was actually playing among young people.

A student from the directing department of the Beijing Film Academy once visited Zhong Dianfei. After asking about the student's studies, Zhong Dianfei, still unclear about the situation of the entire academy, pretended to care about the younger generation and said, "You completely abandon your own national style, and it's not right to simply copy Soviet things like this!" Later, he mentioned the name of a teacher he knew well and said, "How is ××× doing? Is he being temperamental again?" The Film Academy is a new professional school, and there may be some shortcomings in its teaching, and its teachers and equipment are still quite lacking, and it needs support and encouragement from all aspects of society; but Zhong Dianfei said these inappropriate words in front of a student he met for the first time, and maliciously slandered the academy's teaching work and teachers. Isn't this deliberately shaking the students' learning enthusiasm and inciting their dissatisfaction with the leadership?

In the past, Zhong Dianfei used the guise of an "authoritative film critic" to bewilder some young people. They admired him very much and often wrote to him, asking him to help solve some learning and even life problems. For example, a female student from Beijing Normal University once wrote him such a letter. She said that her lover, after watching the Indian film "Awaara," compared her to Rita and himself to Raj. She thought this comparison was not good and felt very angry. She wanted Zhong Dianfei to answer whether this comparison was right or wrong. Obviously, a young person living in a socialist motherland with a bright future, is partial to the scenes depicted in "Awaara," and even compares himself to Raj, such emotions are of course not healthy. Later facts proved that the young man who compared himself to Raj did indeed have more pronounced bourgeois ideas; but how did Zhong Dianfei "help" the questioner who wrote to him? In his reply, he lightly said: these things should not be fussed about in the love life between men and women. Of course, Zhong Dianfei spread his vulgar and decadent bourgeois views among young people, and this is not the only case. He has always promoted capitalist culture among the young comrades he approached. He always liked to tell them how bad domestic films were, but he praised some individual better films in capitalist countries, talking about them with relish. He even said to an editor of a film magazine, "We are now too wary of young people. In fact, what does it matter if we shoot some semi-nude scenes in movies for them to see!" He not only said these shameless words in contact with individuals, but even in public, he tried to take advantage of opportunities to promote his ideas.

Zhong Dianfei's hatred for the leading departments of the film industry is very deep. In addition to personally beating the gong for film attacks, he also wanted to use the hands of young people to help him strike a blow. Indeed, that's exactly what happened. He said, "Our task is to vigorously criticize and expose the shortcomings in the work of the film leadership departments." After his "The Gong and Drum of Film" was criticized by responsible comrades of the Central Committee, a young staff member from the Chinese Department of Peking University invited him to give lectures at the school. Zhong Dianfei said that giving lectures was possible, but he put forward a condition, which was that the young man write an article criticizing the formulaic and conceptual nature of domestic films such as "Infinite Potential" and "Great Beginning." Zhong Dianfei even wanted to use the youth newspaper—China Youth Daily—to attack the Party's leadership of the film industry. A reporter from China Youth Daily wrote an article about the Beijing Film Actors Troupe and sent it to Zhong Dianfei for review, asking him if it was "too much." He said, "It doesn't matter." He also said, "Even if it's a little biased, it doesn't matter." He also encouraged China Youth Daily to publish an article criticizing "A Summer Story," and used a provocative method to fan the flames, saying "×× Newspaper is timid," asking whether China Youth Daily had the courage to do this.

Zhong Dianfei often puts on the airs of an elder and inappropriately praises some young people, saying that so-and-so has talent, that so-and-so is a new force, a powerful group, and so on. Does he really appreciate these young people so much? No. Because he believes that "the fame of no writer is unrelated to young people." The reason why he exaggerates so much in praising some young people is only to raise himself, to win them over, and then to control them. This is clearly shown in his attitude towards the young amateur playwright Zhang Xian. Zhang Xian's script "Splendid Years," published in "Chinese Film" magazine, was revised by Zhong Dianfei. When "Chinese Film" published this script, it also published a review article written by Zhong Dianfei under the pseudonym Pu Ruoshi. In the article, in addition to talking about the work itself, Zhong Dianfei also took the opportunity to brag about himself, writing a long passage saying how the revised script was more brilliant than the original, etc.

After Zhong Dianfei's "The Gong and Drum of Film" was criticized, he was full of complaints and resentment. In contact with young people, he also spread his dissatisfaction everywhere. He said to an editor of a film magazine: "How this history will be written in the future is hard to say." When the staff of "Chinese Film" went to organize him to write articles, he replied that the articles could not be written now because he and the Film Bureau "have no common language." Even when a student who only met him once wrote to him, saying that he wanted to engage in film work and asked him for help, he said in a short reply: "Since the gong and drum of film was beaten, my ideas have become ineffective!" And said that there is no place for him to stay in the film industry now. Why did Zhong Dianfei describe his situation as so pitiful? The intention is obvious, but to seek comfort, wanting young people to "cheer him up." But in the anti-rightist wave, young people have already opened their eyes, and they bravely stood up to expose Zhong Dianfei's shameless crimes. The tricks that Zhong Dianfei played can no longer deceive young people.

    钟惦棐在年青人中间玩的什么鬼把戏？
    苏方
    电影界的反党分子钟惦棐一向自命为是青年的“良师益友”，就在最近批判他的座谈会上他作检讨时，也还声言说，他和年青人的关系是正常的，而且似乎在跟他们接触中，还多少对他们有一些帮助。然而事实证明，这完全是一派胡言。他之所以那样热衷于接近年青人，一会儿约这个上他家去谈话，一会儿给那个写一封信，完全是别有用心的。
    现在，让我们来看看钟惦棐到底在年青人当中搞了些什么鬼把戏吧。
    北京电影学院导演系有一个学生曾经去拜访过钟惦棐。钟惦棐问了一下这个学生的学习情况后，对整个学院的情形仍很不清楚，便装出一付关心青年一代的样子说：“你们完全不要自己民族的一套，这样硬搬苏联的东西可不行呀！”后来他又提到一个他所熟悉的教员的名字说：“×××怎样，他又在闹情绪了吧？”电影学院是一个新成立不久的专业学校，教学工作中可能存在一些缺点，师资、设备等也还相当欠缺，正需要社会各方面力量予以支持鼓励；但是钟惦棐却在一个第一次见面的学生面前说了这些不得体的话，对学院的教学工作和教师进行恶意的毁谤，这难道不是有意动摇学生学习情绪，鼓动学生对领导不满吗？
    过去，钟惦棐以“权威的影评家”为幌子，迷惑了一些年青人。他们对他很景仰，经常给他写信，要求他帮助解决一些学习上乃至生活上的问题。譬如北京师范大学有一位女同学就曾经写过这样一封信给他。她说她的爱人看了印度影片“流浪者”以后，便把她比作丽达，把自己比作拉兹。她认为这种比法不好，听了很生气。她要钟惦棐回答她这样比法对不对。很显然，一个生活在社会主义祖国、前途无限光明的青年，偏偏眷恋于“流浪者”中描绘的情景，甚至把自己比作拉兹，这种情感当然是不够健康的。后来事实证明，那个自比为拉兹的青年的确是有较浓厚的资产阶级思想的；但是钟惦棐怎么“帮助”来信的求教者呢？他在回信中却轻描淡写地说：在男女爱情生活中不应该计较这些。当然钟惦棐在青年当中散播他的庸俗腐朽的资产阶级观点，还不只此一例。他一向就在和他接近的年青同志中宣扬资本主义的文化。他总爱对他们说，国产片是如何如何不好，对于资本主义国家中一些个别较好的影片，他却推崇备至，津津乐道。他甚至对一个电影刊物的编辑说：“我们现在对年青人防备得太厉害了，其实在影片中拍一些半裸镜头给他们看看，又有什么关系哩！”他不仅在和个别人接触中说这些恬不知耻的话，即使在公开场合中，他也要尽量利用机会宣传他这一套。
    钟惦棐对于电影事业领导部门的仇恨是很深的，除了他亲自敲起电影的锣鼓进行攻击外，他还想利用青年们的手来帮他打一拳，事实也确乎就是这样。他说：“我们的任务就是要大力批评和揭发电影领导部门工作中的缺点。”他写的“电影的锣鼓”受到中央负责同志批评之后，北京大学中文系有一个年青工作人员请他到学校去讲课，钟惦棐说讲课是可以，但却提出了一个交换条件，就是要这个年青人写一篇批评国产片“无穷的潜力”、“伟大的起点”等影片公式化、概念化的文章。钟惦棐甚至还想利用青年的报纸——中国青年报去攻击党对电影事业的领导。中国青年报有位记者写了一篇关于北京电影演员剧团的文章，送给钟惦棐审阅，问他是否“过火了”，他却说，“没关系”。又说：“即使偏一些也不要紧。”他又鼓动中国青年报发表批评“夏天的故事”的文章，并且采取了激将法来煽火，说“××报胆子小”，问中国青年报有没有胆子来干这件事。
    钟惦棐常常摆出一副老前辈的样子，不适当地夸奖一些年青人，说某某有才华，说某某是新生力量、强力集团等等。他真的如此赏识这些年青人吗？不是的。因为他认为“没有一个作家的成名，不是和青年有关系的”。他之所以如此夸大其词地捧一些年青人，不过借此抬高自己，借此拉拢他们，并进而控制他们罢了。这从他对待青年业余剧作者张弦的态度上便清楚地显现了出来。张弦发表在“中国电影”杂志上的剧本“锦绣年华”是经过钟惦棐修改的。“中国电影”刊登这个剧本时，还登载了钟惦棐化名蒲若是写的评介文章。在文章里面，钟惦棐除了谈到作品本身外，也趁机为自己吹嘘了一通，写了一长段说修改后的剧本如何比原稿更为出色等等。
    钟惦棐的“电影的锣鼓”被批评以后，他牢骚满腹，怨气冲天。在和年青人接触中，他也四处散放他的不满情绪。他对一位电影刊物的编辑说：“将来这笔历史怎么写，还很难说。”“中国电影”的工作人员去组织他写文章，他却答复说，文章现在不能写，因为他和电影局“没有共同的语言”。甚至一个和他只有一面之缘的学生写信给他，说自己想搞电影工作，请他帮助时，他在回复的一封短简中也这样说：“自从电影的锣鼓敲过以后，我的点子就不灵了！”并且说现在电影界已无一席之地令他容身。钟惦棐为什么把自己的处境描写得如此可怜呢？用意很显然，不过是企图寻找安慰，想让年青人来给他“打打气”罢了。但是在反右派的浪潮中，年青人已经擦亮了眼睛，他们勇敢地挺身出来，揭发了钟惦棐的无耻罪行。钟惦棐所玩的鬼把戏，再也欺骗不了年青人了。
