Xinhua News Agency, August 31st, London dispatch: The Yemeni Embassy in London sent a note to the British Foreign Office on the 30th, strongly protesting the continued British air force bombing of Yemen.

The note stated: "The British Air Force is still using all means of destruction to continue attacking the Shuqayrah area in the free territory of Yemen. From this, it appears that the British government is attempting to violate the agreements concluded between the two countries and the principles of the United Nations Charter, and to seize this area by force."

The note stated that the Yemeni government expressed strong protest against this continuous aggression and demanded that the British government immediately cease such aggression.

This is the third protest by the Yemeni Embassy this week against British acts of aggression. The British Foreign Office stubbornly insisted that the note was "inconsistent with the facts" and refused to accept Yemen's protest.

On the same day, the Yemeni Ambassador to Egypt, Abu Taleb, issued a warning in Cairo against British acts of aggression. Abu Taleb said that he received a telegram that day from the King of Yemen, Ahmad, saying: "Britain's attacks and provocations against our country have been carried out repeatedly so many times that we can no longer tolerate them."

Abu Taleb said that Yemen had tried everything possible to reach an agreement with Britain, but Britain showed no respect for international law and treaties. He said that Yemen "has full reason to take measures to safeguard its security."

    艾哈迈德国王警告英国
    也门不能再听任侵略
    据新华社31日讯  伦敦消息：也门驻英国公使馆30日向英国外交部发出照会，强烈抗议英国空军继续轰炸也门。
    这项照会说：“英国空军还在使用一切毁灭办法，继续进攻自由也门领土上的什乌格埃尔地区。从这看来，英国政府企图违反两国所缔结的协定，并且违反联合国宪章的原则，用武力侵占这个地区。”
    照会说，也门政府对这种连续不断的侵略行动表示强烈抗议，并且要求英国政府立即停止这种侵略。
    这是也门公使馆在本星期第三次抗议英国的侵略行为。英国外交部硬说这个照会和“事实不符”，拒绝接受也门的抗议。
    同一天，也门驻埃及公使阿布·塔莱布在开罗对英国的侵略行动发出了警告。阿布·塔莱布说，他在当天收到也门国王艾哈迈德的一封电报说：“英国对我国的进攻和挑衅已经一再进行了这样多次数，我们再不能听之任之了。”
    阿布·塔莱布说，也门曾经想尽一切办法要同英国达成协议，但是，英国表现得丝毫不尊重国际法和条约。他说，也门“有充分的理由采取措施来维护它的安全”。
