    Oil Materials
    Guangxi's Peanut Purchase Volume Greatly Increased
    (Our newspaper's report) The amount of peanuts purchased and stored in Guangxi Province has recently increased significantly. Lai Bin County, one of the key oil-producing counties, has increased by 400,000 jin compared to the same period last year.
    The counties directly under the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, Yishan area, and Rongxian Special District are areas in Guangxi Province where early-maturing peanuts are widely planted. In the previous period, the amount of peanuts purchased and stored in these areas was very small because many agricultural cooperatives' production teams privately distributed peanuts, concealed yields, and were unwilling to sell to the state. This situation only began to change after the socialist great debate was launched among the masses in mid-August and the oil crop unified purchase policy was publicized. For example, in the counties directly under the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, from August 21st to August 30th, the amount stored in ten days increased by double the amount stored before the 20th.
    Fujian Exceeds Early Peanut Unified Purchase Task
    (Our newspaper's report) Fujian Province has exceeded its early peanut unified purchase task. According to statistics from the Provincial Grain Department, by the end of August, the total number of purchases and storage in various regions has exceeded the province's early peanut unified purchase plan by 8.12%, completing 74.81% of the annual plan. However, the progress of unified purchases and storage in some areas is still very slow.
    Now Fujian's late peanuts have begun to appear, and are mostly concentrated in September. All regions must seize the opportunity, make persistent efforts, and strive to purchase more. (Xu Qihua)
    Shandong Universally Purchases Wild Oil Materials
    (Our newspaper's report) Shandong Province is very rich in wild oil materials. According to statistics from three counties, Guangrao, Lijin, and Zhanhua, wild oil materials such as cocklebur, seepweed, and wild melon seeds can produce more than 90 million jin every year. If they can all be purchased, they can be used to extract more than 9 million jin of oil. In addition, twenty-five kinds of wild plant seeds that can be used to extract oil have also been discovered in forty counties including Boxing and Liangshan. Recently, the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative decided to universally carry out purchase work throughout the province.
    Zhejiang Torreya Grandis Increases Production
    Xinhua News Agency report: Zhejiang Province's famous local product, Torreya grandis, has begun to be harvested. This year is a good year for Torreya grandis, and the province's output is estimated to reach about 660,000 jin, an increase of more than double compared to last year.
    A large Torreya grandis tree can bear three to four hundred jin of Torreya grandis in a good year. The oil content of Torreya grandis is 41.8%. It is crispy and delicious when eaten.

    广西花生收购量大增
    本报讯　广西省最近花生统购入库数量大有增加，重点产油县之一的来宾县较去年同期增加了四十万斤。
    桂西僮族自治州直属县、宜山地区、容县专区是广西省种植早熟花生较多的地区。在前一个时期，这些地区统购花生入库数量很少，因为不少农业社的生产队私分花生，隐瞒产量，不愿卖给国家。自8月中旬在群众中开展社会主义大辩论，宣传了油料统购政策后，这种情况才开始扭转。如桂西僮族自治州直属县从8月21日起到8月30日，十天时间入库数量就比20日以前入库量增加了一倍。
    福建超额完成早花生统购任务
    本报讯　福建省早花生统购任务已超额完成。据省粮食厅统计，到8月底止，各地统购入库总数已超过全省早花生统购计划8.12％，完成年度计划74.81％。但也有的地区统购入库进展还很缓慢。
    现在福建晚花生已开始露面，且多集中在9月份，各地必须抓紧时机，再接再厉，力争多购。　（徐启华）
    山东普遍收购野生油料
    本报讯　山东省野生油料产量很丰富。据广饶、利津、沾化等三个县统计，仅苍耳子、盐蒿子、野瓜种子等野生油料，每年就可产九千多万斤，若能全部收购起来，可榨油九百多万斤。除此，在博兴、梁山等四十个县，也发现了二十五种野生植物的种子可以用来榨油。最近山东省供销社决定在全省普遍开展收购工作。
    浙江香榧子增产
    新华社讯　浙江省著名土产香榧子已经开始采收。今年香榧子是大年，全省产量估计可以达到六十六万斤左右，比去年增产一倍以上。
    一株大香榧树逢到大年，能结香榧子三、四百斤。香榧子的含油量为41.8％。食时，香脆可口。
