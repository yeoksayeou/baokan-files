The bourgeois rightists are the most insidious enemies of the youth. They are two-faced everywhere, waving the charming banner of "helping the Party rectify its work" to incite the masses to attack the Communist Party. They disguise themselves as "righteous men" and "swordsmen", demanding "democracy", "freedom" and "human rights" from the Communist Party and the proletariat. They pose as "independent thinking" "talents" and attack Marxism in the name of anti-dogmatism. They stop at nothing, yet pretend to be the "intimate friends" of young people, deceiving people into sympathizing and believing them, in order to achieve the sinister purpose of usurping the Party's leadership over the youth and leading the youth in the direction of the bourgeoisie.

Days of Ominous Clouds

The rightists among the students of Tsinghua University began by negating the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign to negate the entire leadership of the Party and the socialist system. Rightists Feng Guojiang, Luo Lan (formerly Wei Degao) and others described the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign as a complete darkness. Feng Guojiang slandered the result of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign as "confusing the enemy with ourselves, expanding the contradictions within the people, and destroying human rights and the constitution!" Luo Lan also clamored that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "human rights trampled on! The constitution trampled on!" In order to prove their reactionary views, the rightists shamelessly used fabricated rumors to deceive the masses.

Rightist Ma Qi (formerly Ma Weiqi) also put forward the reactionary slogan of "returning power to the people." Ma Qi and other rightists also viciously attacked Marxism under the banner of "independent thinking" and "opposing dogmatism." Ma Qi claimed to "resolutely oppose orthodox Marxist superstition" and slandered Party members and League members as "Marx's selfish rebellious sons."

The student right-wing group "Shumin Society" even used eight Communist Youth League members as the backbone to carry out anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. The leader of this group, Sun Baozong, even dreamed of a "Hungarian incident" in China. He once arrogantly said: "If Tsinghua had twenty old Suns like me, it would turn the world upside down." Even after the anti-rightist struggle exposed his anti-communist conspiracy, he still claimed that he would fight the Communist Party to the end. Under his leadership, the Shumin Society published three issues of mimeographed newspapers, four issues of wall posters, and one special issue of "cartoons" in just ten days. Their articles and paintings were full of vicious attacks on the Party's various policies and Party cadres.

In the struggle to expose and criticize these rightists, the students deeply realized that the class struggle had not been extinguished. Enemies who hate the socialist system have not laid down their weapons. They are constantly competing with the Communist Party for youth. They are constantly accumulating strength and watching the direction, and when the opportunity arises, they will throw out their poisonous swords.

In the struggle against Qian Weichang, the students more clearly saw that the bourgeois rightists particularly valued the youth in their rampant attack on anti-communism and anti-socialism. They attempted to seize the Party's leadership over the youth and further realize the political conspiracy to overthrow the entire leadership of the Party.

This great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts is a strict test for every Communist Youth League member. In the struggle, some people have a firm stand, clear understanding, and actively fight against the rightists. Some people surrendered and rebelled, engaging in sinful anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Some people wavered between the left and the right. Now let's take a look at their performance!

Severe Test

In the short period when the rightists began their rampant attack on the Party, many Communist Youth League members temporarily lost their way and hesitated and wavered. But true communist fighters are people with a clear proletarian stand and a high degree of political acumen. In the bewitching maze set up by the rightists, they can also smell who is the enemy and who is the friend. On June 6, when the rightists' attack was at its most rampant and dark clouds were all over the campus, Luo Jianmin, a Communist Youth League member in the second grade of the Department of Architecture, was the first to post a big-character poster "Communist Youth League Members, Arise and Fight!" calling on comrades to open their eyes, stand firm, and fight to safeguard the interests of socialism! Then, regardless of the dissatisfaction of the rightists in the class and the masses who were temporarily blinded by right-leaning thoughts, and the several meetings to encircle and suppress him, he continued to publish several big-character posters criticizing the rightist Huang Wanli.

At the same time, a group of outstanding Communist Youth League members and Party cadres came out to launch fierce debates against the rightists. Comrades Liu Naiquan and Cao Xiaoxian of the Department of Engineering Physics, organized some Party members and League members with a clear class stand and combat effectiveness to establish a combat team to fight against the rightist Luo Lan, who slandered the Party's suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, and took the lead in launching criticism of Qian Weichang, the leader of the rightists in Tsinghua. After the first big-character poster criticizing Qian Weichang was posted, the broad masses of people still did not have a clear understanding of Qian's face, and many people stood up to defend Qian Weichang, but they were not discouraged by this. They continued to work hard for thirty-six consecutive hours and wrote a twenty-two-page big-character poster "Re-Evaluating Qian Weichang's Attitude," and conducted a more systematic analysis and criticism of Qian Weichang's rightist arguments. This well-reasoned big-character poster was immediately welcomed by the broad masses of people. Comrades Zhang Xiaowen and Lü Xiaoqin of the Department of Mechanical Engineering organized the "Goethe Society" to launch a criticism of the rightist Huang Wanli. There were also Comrades Zhou Yunzheng and Liu Fang of the Department of Civil Engineering; Comrades Xiao Lin, Guo Yuzhi, and Hong Ye of the Department of Architecture, who were among the first group of outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to join the battle. They firmly relied on the leadership of the Party committee, broke through the various obstacles of certain right-leaning opportunists within the Party and the League, and planted the first batch of dazzling red flags in the smoky Tsinghua campus, gathering the left-wing forces in Tsinghua campus and opening up the front line of the anti-rightist struggle. Since then, more and more masses have gathered around the Party, and the momentum of the left-wing has become greater day by day.

Under the attack of the rightists, a few wavering elements in the League took the shameful road of betrayal. The most prominent was the General Branch Committee of the Communist Youth League of the Department of Electrical Engineering. Under the leadership of Liu Zhuoyun, the secretary of the general branch, they completely lost their position, causing the entire organization to fall into a state of complete disintegration and paralysis for a period of time.

Liu Zhuoyun himself came from a landlord family and has always had strong bourgeois individualism. He was not transformed after joining the Party. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, in order to maintain his personal prestige and status and "win the support of the masses," he went everywhere to find students who were dissatisfied with the Party and those who were struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and made a confession that lost his position. He also gathered two Party branch secretaries to jointly post big-character posters attacking the Party, slandering the Party's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the same tone as the rightists. Other members of the General Branch Committee of the Department of Electrical Engineering also went to various classes under the leadership of Liu Zhuoyun to incite and ignite the flames, launching a rampant attack on the Party committee.

Under the poisonous flames of the rightists' attack, some middle masses had temporarily lost their way and were unable to distinguish between right and wrong. They even applauded and cheered the rightists. At the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, many of them still could not understand the situation ideologically. After three months of fierce battle, the vast majority of the masses have raised their ideological awareness. For example, a female student in the Department of Architecture once believed it to be true after listening to Feng Guojiang's "speech" "accusing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries," and even wrote a letter to Feng Guojiang to express her sympathy and condolences. However, when the whole school exposed Feng Guojiang's criminal activities of fabricating rumors to slander the Party's suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign and consistently hating the Party and socialism, the female student's thinking underwent a drastic change, and she took the stage with righteous indignation to expose Feng Guojiang's criminal activities and deceptive methods.

Many students felt that this anti-rightist struggle was a great harvest. Someone said: "Three months of fighting is better than reading books for three years." This is indeed the case. These three months were such an extraordinary period for people, especially for young students who lacked practical struggle experience, and how many lessons were worth remembering!

Lessons Worth Remembering

Now, the anti-rightist struggle at Tsinghua University has come to an end, but this is only the first round of the battle. We are summing up our experiences and lessons to meet the new battle in the next semester. What lessons do we have to remember?

First of all, we realize that we must strengthen the education of the proletarian stand and resolutely oppose bourgeois individualism, liberalism and anarchism. Judging from this struggle, the rightists all have certain class roots and ideological roots.

Of course, class origin has a profound impact on people's thinking, position, style, and feelings. But the important issue is to strengthen education and carry out ideological transformation. We must continue to strengthen political and ideological work among young students, and pay special attention to strengthening the education of the class stand and organizing participation in productive labor, so that intellectuals can combine with workers and peasants and transform themselves into truly working-class intellectuals.

Secondly, we should strengthen the organizational construction of the Communist Youth League. In this anti-rightist struggle, the traitors within a small number of Communist Youth League members were exposed and purged, making the League's organization more pure and consolidated. At the same time, it was also found that the class consciousness of many Communist Youth League members was not high enough, and their political acumen was not sharp enough. The League's organization still needs to be rectified and consolidated in the future to further improve the League's combat effectiveness.

At the same time, it is necessary to consolidate the Party's leadership over young students and the Communist Youth League. The reason why a small number of young students and Communist Youth League members stumbled in this political struggle is largely due to the fact that they wavered in their trust in the Party's leadership. Therefore, in the future socialist construction, revolutionary young students must clearly establish the absolute necessity of the Party's leadership in their thinking. The League's organization must educate every Communist Youth League member to fight to safeguard the Party's leadership.

　　共青团员的第一课
　　共青团清华大学委员会书记　阮铭
    资产阶级右派是青年的最阴险的敌人。他们处处耍弄两面手法，打起“帮助党整风”的迷人旗帜，煽惑群众向共产党进攻。他们装扮成“义士”和“剑侠”，向共产党和无产阶级要“民主”、要“自由”、要“人权”。他们装扮成“独立思考”的“才子”，以反教条主义攻击马克思主义。他们无恶不作，却装成青年的“知心朋友”，骗取人们的同情和相信，以达到篡夺党对青年的领导，把青年引向资产阶级方向的罪恶目的。
    乌云弥漫的日子
    清华大学学生中的右派分子，是以否定肃反运动开始来否定整个党的领导和社会主义制度的。右派分子冯国将、罗兰（原名韦德高）等人，把肃反运动说成一团漆黑。冯国将污蔑肃反运动的结果是“混淆了敌我。扩大了人民内部矛盾。人权、宪法被破坏殆尽！”罗兰也叫嚣肃反是“人权被蹂躏！宪法被践踏！”为了证实他们的这种反动观点，右派分子竟无耻地用捏造谣言来欺骗群众。
    右派分子马琦（原名马维琦）还提出了“还政于民”的反动口号。马琦等右派分子，又打着“独立思考”、“反对教条主义”的招牌恶毒攻击马克思主义。马琦声称要“坚决反对正统马克思主义迷信”。诬蔑党团员是“马克思的自私的逆子”。
    学生中的右派集团“庶民社”更以八个共青团员为骨干进行反共、反社会主义的活动。这个集团的头目孙宝琮，竟幻想在中国来个“匈牙利事件”。他曾狂妄地说：“假如清华有二十个俺这样的老孙，就会闹得天翻地覆”。直到反右派斗争揭发了他的反共阴谋以后，他还声称要和共产党干到底。他领导下的庶民社，在短短的十天内，就出了三期油印报，四期墙报，一次“漫画”专刊。在他们的文章和画里，充满了对党的各项政策和党的干部的恶毒攻击。
    同学们在揭露批判这些右派分子的斗争中，深深体会到阶级斗争并没有熄灭。仇视社会主义制度的敌人还没有放下武器。他们无时无刻不在和共产党争夺青年。他们无时无刻不在积蓄力量、窥测方向，一有时机，就抛出他们的毒剑。
    在对钱伟长的斗争中，同学们更加清楚地看到了资产阶级右派在反共、反社会主义的猖狂进攻中，特别看中了青年。他们妄图夺取党对青年的领导。并进一步实现推翻整个党的领导的政治阴谋。
    这一次政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命，是对于每一个共青团员的一次严格的考验。在斗争中，有人立场坚定、认识明确、积极与右派分子作斗争。有人投降叛变，进行反党、反社会主义的罪恶活动。有人动摇于左、右两者之间。现在来看一看他们的表现吧！
    严峻的考验
    在右派分子开始向党发动猖狂进攻的一个短时期内，不少共青团员暂时迷失了方向，发生过犹豫和动摇。但是真正的共产主义战士，是具有鲜明的无产阶级立场和高度政治嗅觉的人。他们在右派分子摆布的迷魂阵中，也嗅得出谁是敌人？谁是朋友？6月6日，右派分子进攻最猖獗，校内乌云弥漫之际，建筑系二年级的共青团员罗健敏，第一个贴出“共青团员们，起来战斗”的大字报，号召同志们擦亮眼睛，站稳脚跟，为维护社会主义的利益斗争！接着，他不顾班上右派分子和一时为右倾思想所蒙蔽的群众对他的不满和几次开会围剿，继续出了几张批判右派分子黄万里的大字报。
    同时出来向右派分子展开激烈论战的，还有一批优秀的共青团员和党员干部。工程物理系的刘乃泉、曹小先等同志，组织了一些阶级立场鲜明，有战斗力的党员和团员建立了战斗小组，向污蔑党的肃反运动的右派分子罗兰进行了斗争，并且首先发动对清华右派头目钱伟长的批判。第一张批判钱伟长的大字报贴出去后，广大群众对钱的面目还认识不清，不少人起来为钱伟长辩护，但他们并不因此气馁。再接再厉地连续工作三十六小时，写成了二十二页的大字报“再评钱伟长的态度”，针对钱伟长的右派论点，进行了比较系统的分析批判。这张说理充分的大字报，立即受到广大群众的欢迎。机械系的张孝文、吕孝勤等同志，组织了“歌德社”展开了对右派分子黄万里的批判。还有土木系的周允正、刘方；建筑系的萧林、过于执、红叶等同志，都是最早一批投入战斗的优秀的共产党员和共青团员。他们坚定地依靠党委的领导，冲破党内、团内某些右倾机会主义分子的各种阻挠，在乌烟瘴气的清华园里插起了第一批光彩夺目的红旗，聚集清华园内的左派力量，开辟了反右派斗争的前哨阵地。自此以后，愈来愈多的群众聚集到党的周围，左派的声势一天比一天浩大。
    在右派的进攻下，也有少数团内的不坚定分子走上了可耻的叛变道路。最突出的是电机系团总支委员会。在总支书记刘倬云的领导下，全部丧失立场，使整个组织在一个时期内完全陷于瓦解、瘫痪状态。
    刘倬云本人出身于地主家庭，一贯具有浓厚的资产阶级个人主义思想，入党后没有得到改造。整风一开始，他为了保持个人威信地位，
  “争取群众拥护”，就到处寻找对党不满和肃反被斗的同学，进行丧失立场的检讨。他并且纠集两个党支部书记共同贴出向党进攻的大字报，和右派分子一个腔调地污蔑党的肃反政策。电机系总支委员会的其他委员也在刘倬云的领导下到各班去煽动点火，发动对党委的猖狂进攻。
    在右派分子进攻的毒焰下，一部分中间群众曾经暂时迷失过方向，分辨不清是非。甚至对右派分子进行过鼓掌喝采。反右派斗争开始时，他们中有不少人还搞不通思想。经过了三个月的激烈战斗，绝大部分群众都提高了思想认识。例如建筑系有一个女同学，在开始听了冯国将“控诉肃反”的“演说”后，曾经信以为真，还写信给冯国将表示同情和慰问。但是当全校揭露了冯国将造谣污蔑党的肃反运动和一贯敌视党和社会主义的罪恶活动后，这位女同学思想上才起了剧烈的转变，义愤填胸地上台揭露冯国将的罪恶活动和欺骗手段。
    许多同学感到这次反右派斗争收获巨大。有人说：“三个月的战斗，胜读三年书。”确是如此。这三个月对于人们，尤其是对于缺乏实际斗争锻炼的青年学生们，是多么不平常的日子，有多少值得记取的教训啊！
    值得记取的教训
    现在，清华大学的反右派斗争已经告一段落，但这只是战斗的第一个回合。我们正在总结经验教训，以迎接下一学期新的战斗。我们有哪些值得记取的教训呢？
    首先，我们认识到了必须加强无产阶级立场的教育，坚决反对资产阶级个人主义、自由主义和无政府主义思想。从这次斗争看来，右派分子都有他们一定的阶级根源和思想根源。
    当然阶级出身对人们的思想、立场、作风、感情有深厚的影响。但重要的问题是要加强教育，进行思想改造。我们必须继续加强对青年学生的政治思想工作，特别要注意加强阶级立场的教育和组织参加生产劳动，使知识分子与工农相结合，改造成为真正工人阶级的知识分子。
    其次，应当加强共青团的组织建设。这次反右派斗争中，暴露和清洗了少数共青团内的叛徒，使团的组织更加纯洁、更加巩固了。同时，也发现了不少共青团员的阶级觉悟还不够高，政治嗅觉还不够灵敏。团的组织，今后还需要继续加以整顿和巩固，以进一步提高团的战斗力。
    同时要巩固党对青年学生和共青团的领导。少数青年学生和共青团员在这次政治斗争中失足的原因，很大程度上是由于动摇了对党的领导的信任。因此，在今后的社会主义建设中，革命的青年学生都必须在思想上清楚地确定党的领导的绝对必要性。团的组织要教育每一个共青团员为维护党的领导而斗争。
