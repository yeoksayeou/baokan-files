The bourgeois rightists are the most insidious enemies of the youth. They are two-faced everywhere, waving the charming banner of "helping the Party rectify its work" to incite the masses to attack the Communist Party. They disguise themselves as "righteous men" and "swordsmen", demanding "democracy", "freedom" and "human rights" from the Communist Party and the proletariat. They pose as "independent thinking" "talents" and attack Marxism in the name of anti-dogmatism. They stop at nothing, yet pretend to be the "intimate friends" of young people, deceiving people into sympathizing and believing them, in order to achieve the sinister purpose of usurping the Party's leadership over the youth and leading the youth in the direction of the bourgeoisie.

Days of Ominous Clouds

The rightists among the students of Tsinghua University began by negating the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign to negate the entire leadership of the Party and the socialist system. Rightists Feng Guojiang, Luo Lan (formerly Wei Degao) and others described the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign as a complete darkness. Feng Guojiang slandered the result of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign as "confusing the enemy with ourselves, expanding the contradictions within the people, and destroying human rights and the constitution!" Luo Lan also clamored that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "human rights trampled on! The constitution trampled on!" In order to prove their reactionary views, the rightists shamelessly used fabricated rumors to deceive the masses.

Rightist Ma Qi (formerly Ma Weiqi) also put forward the reactionary slogan of "returning power to the people." Ma Qi and other rightists also viciously attacked Marxism under the banner of "independent thinking" and "opposing dogmatism." Ma Qi claimed to "resolutely oppose orthodox Marxist superstition" and slandered Party members and League members as "Marx's selfish rebellious sons."

The student right-wing group "Shumin Society" even used eight Communist Youth League members as the backbone to carry out anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. The leader of this group, Sun Baozong, even dreamed of a "Hungarian incident" in China. He once arrogantly said: "If Tsinghua had twenty old Suns like me, it would turn the world upside down." Even after the anti-rightist struggle exposed his anti-communist conspiracy, he still claimed that he would fight the Communist Party to the end. Under his leadership, the Shumin Society published three issues of mimeographed newspapers, four issues of wall posters, and one special issue of "cartoons" in just ten days. Their articles and paintings were full of vicious attacks on the Party's various policies and Party cadres.

In the struggle to expose and criticize these rightists, the students deeply realized that the class struggle had not been extinguished. Enemies who hate the socialist system have not laid down their weapons. They are constantly competing with the Communist Party for youth. They are constantly accumulating strength and watching the direction, and when the opportunity arises, they will throw out their poisonous swords.

In the struggle against Qian Weichang, the students more clearly saw that the bourgeois rightists particularly valued the youth in their rampant attack on anti-communism and anti-socialism. They attempted to seize the Party's leadership over the youth and further realize the political conspiracy to overthrow the entire leadership of the Party.

This great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts is a strict test for every Communist Youth League member. In the struggle, some people have a firm stand, clear understanding, and actively fight against the rightists. Some people surrendered and rebelled, engaging in sinful anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Some people wavered between the left and the right. Now let's take a look at their performance!

Severe Test

In the short period when the rightists began their rampant attack on the Party, many Communist Youth League members temporarily lost their way and hesitated and wavered. But true communist fighters are people with a clear proletarian stand and a high degree of political acumen. In the bewitching maze set up by the rightists, they can also smell who is the enemy and who is the friend. On June 6, when the rightists' attack was at its most rampant and dark clouds were all over the campus, Luo Jianmin, a Communist Youth League member in the second grade of the Department of Architecture, was the first to post a big-character poster "Communist Youth League Members, Arise and Fight!" calling on comrades to open their eyes, stand firm, and fight to safeguard the interests of socialism! Then, regardless of the dissatisfaction of the rightists in the class and the masses who were temporarily blinded by right-leaning thoughts, and the several meetings to encircle and suppress him, he continued to publish several big-character posters criticizing the rightist Huang Wanli.

At the same time, a group of outstanding Communist Youth League members and Party cadres came out to launch fierce debates against the rightists. Comrades Liu Naiquan and Cao Xiaoxian of the Department of Engineering Physics, organized some Party members and League members with a clear class stand and combat effectiveness to establish a combat team to fight against the rightist Luo Lan, who slandered the Party's suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, and took the lead in launching criticism of Qian Weichang, the leader of the rightists in Tsinghua. After the first big-character poster criticizing Qian Weichang was posted, the broad masses of people still did not have a clear understanding of Qian's face, and many people stood up to defend Qian Weichang, but they were not discouraged by this. They continued to work hard for thirty-six consecutive hours and wrote a twenty-two-page big-character poster "Re-Evaluating Qian Weichang's Attitude," and conducted a more systematic analysis and criticism of Qian Weichang's rightist arguments. This well-reasoned big-character poster was immediately welcomed by the broad masses of people. Comrades Zhang Xiaowen and LÃ¼ Xiaoqin of the Department of Mechanical Engineering organized the "Goethe Society" to launch a criticism of the rightist Huang Wanli. There were also Comrades Zhou Yunzheng and Liu Fang of the Department of Civil Engineering; Comrades Xiao Lin, Guo Yuzhi, and Hong Ye of the Department of Architecture, who were among the first group of outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to join the battle. They firmly relied on the leadership of the Party committee, broke through the various obstacles of certain right-leaning opportunists within the Party and the League, and planted the first batch of dazzling red flags in the smoky Tsinghua campus, gathering the left-wing forces in Tsinghua campus and opening up the front line of the anti-rightist struggle. Since then, more and more masses have gathered around the Party, and the momentum of the left-wing has become greater day by day.

Under the attack of the rightists, a few wavering elements in the League took the shameful road of betrayal. The most prominent was the General Branch Committee of the Communist Youth League of the Department of Electrical Engineering. Under the leadership of Liu Zhuoyun, the secretary of the general branch, they completely lost their position, causing the entire organization to fall into a state of complete disintegration and paralysis for a period of time.

Liu Zhuoyun himself came from a landlord family and has always had strong bourgeois individualism. He was not transformed after joining the Party. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, in order to maintain his personal prestige and status and "win the support of the masses," he went everywhere to find students who were dissatisfied with the Party and those who were struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and made a confession that lost his position. He also gathered two Party branch secretaries to jointly post big-character posters attacking the Party, slandering the Party's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the same tone as the rightists. Other members of the General Branch Committee of the Department of Electrical Engineering also went to various classes under the leadership of Liu Zhuoyun to incite and ignite the flames, launching a rampant attack on the Party committee.

Under the poisonous flames of the rightists' attack, some middle masses had temporarily lost their way and were unable to distinguish between right and wrong. They even applauded and cheered the rightists. At the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, many of them still could not understand the situation ideologically. After three months of fierce battle, the vast majority of the masses have raised their ideological awareness. For example, a female student in the Department of Architecture once believed it to be true after listening to Feng Guojiang's "speech" "accusing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries," and even wrote a letter to Feng Guojiang to express her sympathy and condolences. However, when the whole school exposed Feng Guojiang's criminal activities of fabricating rumors to slander the Party's suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign and consistently hating the Party and socialism, the female student's thinking underwent a drastic change, and she took the stage with righteous indignation to expose Feng Guojiang's criminal activities and deceptive methods.

Many students felt that this anti-rightist struggle was a great harvest. Someone said: "Three months of fighting is better than reading books for three years." This is indeed the case. These three months were such an extraordinary period for people, especially for young students who lacked practical struggle experience, and how many lessons were worth remembering!

Lessons Worth Remembering

Now, the anti-rightist struggle at Tsinghua University has come to an end, but this is only the first round of the battle. We are summing up our experiences and lessons to meet the new battle in the next semester. What lessons do we have to remember?

First of all, we realize that we must strengthen the education of the proletarian stand and resolutely oppose bourgeois individualism, liberalism and anarchism. Judging from this struggle, the rightists all have certain class roots and ideological roots.

Of course, class origin has a profound impact on people's thinking, position, style, and feelings. But the important issue is to strengthen education and carry out ideological transformation. We must continue to strengthen political and ideological work among young students, and pay special attention to strengthening the education of the class stand and organizing participation in productive labor, so that intellectuals can combine with workers and peasants and transform themselves into truly working-class intellectuals.

Secondly, we should strengthen the organizational construction of the Communist Youth League. In this anti-rightist struggle, the traitors within a small number of Communist Youth League members were exposed and purged, making the League's organization more pure and consolidated. At the same time, it was also found that the class consciousness of many Communist Youth League members was not high enough, and their political acumen was not sharp enough. The League's organization still needs to be rectified and consolidated in the future to further improve the League's combat effectiveness.

At the same time, it is necessary to consolidate the Party's leadership over young students and the Communist Youth League. The reason why a small number of young students and Communist Youth League members stumbled in this political struggle is largely due to the fact that they wavered in their trust in the Party's leadership. Therefore, in the future socialist construction, revolutionary young students must clearly establish the absolute necessity of the Party's leadership in their thinking. The League's organization must educate every Communist Youth League member to fight to safeguard the Party's leadership.
