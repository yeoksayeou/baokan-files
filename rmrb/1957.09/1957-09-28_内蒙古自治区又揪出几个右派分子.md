    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region authorities have recently unearthed a number of rightist elements.
    Wu Shizheng, a clerk from the Inner Mongolia People's Procuratorate and a rightist element, attacked, saying: "The Autonomous Region People's Committee has become an office for the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, losing its independence, and the anti-Party campaign led by the Party is replacing the functions of the Procuratorate and judicial organs." This rightist element also viciously attacked the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Procuratorate as a "one-party dictatorship," falsely claiming that "old cadres have poor legal concepts." Therefore, he shamelessly suggested that "old jurists should be appointed to lead the Procuratorate or serve as legal advisors" and that non-Party intellectuals should serve as prosecutors. His aim was to have the Party abandon its leadership over the dictatorship of the proletariat so that bourgeois rightists could seize the instruments of dictatorship. Another rightist element, Zhang Juren (cadre of the Autonomous Region Civil Affairs Department), openly slandered the People's Congress system as undemocratic, saying that it only had "official rule" and no democracy. At the same time, he falsely claimed: "The Communist Party is a mass organization representing a minority of people and cannot lead the state power."
    Diao Kecheng, a secretary of the General Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee and a rightist element, ignited flames everywhere, inciting uprising personnel to carry out anti-Party and anti-people activities. He also organized a group of people to collude with rightist elements in the Inner Mongolia Political Consultative Conference, attempting to use the Inner Mongolia Political Consultative Conference as an anti-Party base to seize leadership power, and then further expand their power to carry out so-called "peaceful counter-revolution," in order to achieve the goal of overthrowing the Communist Party.
    After criticism, the above-mentioned rightist elements were at a loss for words and began to bow their heads and confess their crimes to the people.

    内蒙古自治区又揪出几个右派分子
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区机关最近又揪出一些右派分子。
    内蒙古人民检察院书记员右派分子吴士正攻讦说：“自治区人委会成了内蒙党委办事机关，失去了独立性，党所领导的肃反工作是代替了检察院和司法机关的职能”。这个右派分子并恶毒的攻击自治区人民检察院是“一党专政”，诬蔑“老干部法律观念差”，因此恬不知耻的建议要“旧法学家来担任检察院的领导工作或法律顾问”，要非党知识分子来担任检察员。其目的就是要党放弃对无产阶级专政的领导，使资产阶级右派分子掌握专政武器。另一右派分子张居仁（自治区民政厅干部）公开诬蔑人民代表大会制度不民主，说它只有“官主”，没有民主。同时诬蔑说：“共产党是代表少数人的群众团体，不能领导国家政权”。
    内蒙古自治区人民委员会办公厅秘书，右派分子刁可成到处点火，煽动起义人员进行反党、反人民的活动，并组织一部分人勾结内蒙古政协的右派分子，企图以内蒙古政协为反党阵地夺取领导权，再进一步扩大势力进行所谓“和平的反革命”，以达到推翻共产党的目的。
    以上几个右派分子，经过批判后，已理屈词穷，开始向人民低头认罪。
