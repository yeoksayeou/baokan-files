    Go Deep Among the Grassroots Masses
    By a "People's Daily" Commentator

    Today, this newspaper publishes a report about the Ping Shun County Committee in Shanxi province moving their offices to the countryside and implementing a system of mobile offices. From this, we want to discuss how to further implement the working style of combining leadership with the masses.

    Close integration of leaders and the masses has always been advocated by our Party. Over the decades, we have achieved great success in this regard. Fourteen years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong's article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" was a summary and elevation of this rich practice.

    Even so, the issue of close contact between leaders and the masses remains a persistent problem in our work. The reason this problem exists is, on the one hand, that new elements are constantly being added to the leadership organs, some of whom are not only not good at deeply connecting with the masses, but also bring with them various bad work styles left over from the old society, which hinder their approach to the masses. On the other hand, the rapid development of the revolutionary cause means that cadres' thinking cannot keep up with the needs of the developing situation. For example, the land reform period was one situation, and the cooperativization period was another. Under different situations, the masses will have different demands. If we cannot adapt to this situation, we will fall behind the masses. Therefore, contacting the masses should be an issue we constantly pay close attention to.

    After the basic realization of agricultural production cooperativization throughout the country, the situation in the countryside has undergone fundamental changes, and the issue of close contact with the masses has become even more important. Because, with the development of socialist transformation and socialist construction, various new problems will arise among the masses, and these problems must be resolved promptly and properly so that we can move forward better. And the prerequisite for solving these problems is that leading cadres must go deep into the masses to discover and study the problems. If this is not the case, then the existing problems will accumulate more and more, which will not only hinder the progress of actual work, but may also leave loopholes for bad elements, who can then exploit them to carry out sabotage activities.

    Since the start of the rectification campaign, the leadership organs at all levels of the Party and government, in the spirit of rectifying while correcting, have put forward many improvement measures after examining the shortcomings in their leadership work. Among these improvement measures, an important one is to streamline leadership organs and send cadres who can be spared down to grassroots organizations and back to production posts. According to incomplete statistics from nineteen provinces (regions) and cities, recently, 100,000 cadres have returned to production posts and 200,000 cadres have been added to grassroots organizations. These will undoubtedly have a significant impact on improving work and connecting with the masses. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, it is also necessary to improve the existing work of the organs and strengthen ties with the masses. Leading cadres frequently going down to inspect work is a good method, but this is still only for a few people. It is necessary to allow more organ cadres to directly contact the masses and truly understand them. Today, the report from Ping Shun County provides a very good example. The effect of Ping Shun County's implementation of mobile office work in the countryside is very significant. During the short period of forty days of mobile work, the County Committee directly conveyed Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" to more than 35,000 people, visited more than 4,700 households, and interviewed more than 9,700 people; In accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's report, a class education was conducted in depth among the masses. On the basis of raising the masses' class consciousness, democracy was fully developed, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out. In this way, the masses of the entire county put forward more than 12,400 criticisms and suggestions, and after research, 80% of the opinions were resolved on the spot.

    This fact shows that as long as we are determined to go deep among the masses and truly adopt the working method of the mass line, leading cadres who have worked in organs for a long time can also have extensive contact with the masses, and can deeply publicize the Party's principles and implement the Party's policies among the masses. In terms of conveying policies and instructions, the usual method is to hold three-level cadre meetings, or to cascade down to the townships, and then convey to the masses. This method is inevitably prone to discrepancies. If the leading cadres directly convey the policies to the masses, it's usually individual cases. This time, the Ping Shun County Committee directly conveyed Chairman Mao's report to more than 35,000 people, enabling the masses to directly understand the spirit of the central government, which will become a powerful weapon for them to solve rural problems. This can be done when conveying Chairman Mao's report, and it can also be done when publicizing other important policies of the Party and the country.

    Only when leading cadres have extensive contact with the masses can they quickly understand the problems existing among the masses and solve them in a timely manner. There are also two different methods for dealing with the problems existing among the masses: one is to sit firmly in the office, study the problems and determine the plan from the reports transferred level by level; the other is to leave the office, go deep into the masses to discover the problems, and solve them in a timely manner. The two different methods will also produce two different effects. The former not only prolongs the time to solve the problem, but also, due to the separation from the actual situation, it is inevitable that subjectivism and bureaucratism will occur sometimes; the latter can avoid these shortcomings, truly discover and solve the problems among the masses, and advance the actual work. Ping Shun County listened to more than 12,400 opinions from the masses this time, and 80% of the opinions were resolved on the spot, which has an inestimable effect on promoting the progress of actual work.

    There is no intention here to underestimate the work of the organs, and even less to require all leading cadres of the organs to move their offices to the masses, but rather to say that all leadership work should be based on close contact with the masses. The Ping Shun County Committee's mobile office is the best way for county-level organs to contact the masses, and other counties and other organs can also create more ways to contact the masses according to their own conditions. Now, we are opposing bureaucratism and subjectivism. Generally speaking, our cadres will never be willing to act as bureaucrats or subjectivists, but it is only because they have not contacted the masses and reality well that they have been infected with the problems of bureaucratism and subjectivism. Ping Shun County has set an example for us to overcome bureaucratism and subjectivism, and everyone should learn from them well.

    深入到基层群众中间去
    本报评论员
    今天，本报发表了山西平顺县委把机关办公室搬到农村实行巡回办公的报道。从这里，我们想讨论怎样进一步贯彻领导和群众相结合的工作作风问题。
    领导和群众密切结合，从来都是我们党所提倡的。几十年来，在这方面我们取得很大的成绩。十四年前，毛泽东同志所写的“关于领导方法的若干问题”一文，就是从丰富的实践中总结出来，并且加以提高的。
    虽然这样，但是领导和群众密切联系的问题，仍是我们工作中经常存在的问题。这个问题所以存在，一方面，因为领导机构中不断增加新的成分，其中有些人不仅不善于深入地联系群众，而且带来了旧社会遗留下来的各种各样的不良作风，这些，都阻碍了和群众的接近。另一方面，由于革命事业迅速地向前发展，干部的思想赶不上形势发展的需要。比如：土地改革时期是一种形势，合作化时期又是一种形势。不同形势下群众会产生不同的要求。如果不能适应这种情况，就会落在群众的后面。所以联系群众，应当是我们经常密切注意的问题。
    在全国农业生产合作化已基本上实现以后，农村情况已起了根本性的变化，密切联系群众的问题就更显得重要了。因为，随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的发展，在群众中会产生各种各样的新的问题，必须及时地妥善解决这些问题，我们才会更好地前进。而解决这些问题的先决条件，就是要领导干部深入群众，去发现和研究问题。如果不是这样，那么，存在的问题就会越积越多，将不仅会阻碍了实际工作的进展，而且可能会给坏分子留下了可乘之隙，他们就便于利用来进行破坏活动。
    整风开始以来，党和政府的各级领导机关本着边整边改的精神，在检查领导工作中的缺点以后，提出了许多改进办法。在这些改进办法中重要的一项就是精简领导机构，把能够抽出来的干部下放到基层组织去，送回到生产岗位上去。根据十九个省（区）、市的不完全统计，最近，已有十万干部回到了生产岗位，二十万干部充实到基层组织中去。这些，对改进工作、联系群众方面，无疑的会产生重大作用。但是，这只是问题的一方面，另一方面，也必须同时改进现有的机关工作，加强和群众的联系。领导干部经常下去检查工作是一个良好的方法，但这还只是少数的人。需要让更多的机关干部和群众直接接触，真正地了解群众。今天，平顺县的报道提供了一个很好的范例。平顺县实行机关巡回在农村办公的效果是很显著的。在短短的四十天的巡回工作期间，县委直接向三万五千多群众传达了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，登门访问了四千七百多户，访问了九千七百多人；根据毛主席报告的精神，深入地在群众中进行了一次阶级教育。在群众阶级觉悟提高的基础上，充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评。这样，全县群众共提出批评、建议一万二千四百多条，经过研究，有80％的意见就地得到了解决。
    这个事实说明，只要下决心深入群众，真正地采取群众路线的工作方法，长期在机关工作的领导干部也就有可能广泛地和群众接触，就能够在群众中深入地宣传党的方针，贯彻党的政策。在传达政策指示方面，通常的方法是召开三级干部会议，或者逐级下达到乡，然后传达到群众中去，这种方法是难免不发生差异的。由领导干部直接到群众中，进行传达的，那就只是个别的。平顺县委这一次直接向三万五千多群众传达了毛主席的报告，使群众直接领会到中央的精神，这将会成为他们解决农村问题的有力武器。在传达毛主席报告的时候可以这样做，在宣传党和国家其他重要政策的时候也可以这样做。
    只有领导干部广泛地和群众接触，才能够迅速地了解群众中存在的问题，并且及时地予以解决。对待群众中存在的问题，也有两种不同的解决方法：一种是稳坐机关，从逐级转来的汇报中，研究问题，确定方案；一种是离开机关，深入到群众中，去发现问题，及时地加以解决。两种不同的方法，也将产生两种不同的效果。前者，不仅延长了解决问题的时间，而且由于对实际情况的隔膜，有时就必然要发生主观主义、官僚主义的毛病；后者，就可以避免这些缺点，真正地发现和解决群众中的问题，将实际工作推向前进。平顺县这次听取了群众一万二千四百多条意见，并有80％的意见就地得到解决，这在推动实际工作的进展上，有着不可估量的作用。
    这里，丝毫也没有低估机关工作的意思，更不是要求一切机关的领导干部都将机关办公室搬到群众中去，而是说一切领导工作都应当建立在密切联系群众的基础上。平顺县委巡回办公是县级机关联系群众的一种最好的方法，别的县、别的机关也可以根据自己的条件，创造更多的联系群众的方法。现在，我们正在反对官僚主义和主观主义。一般说来，我们的干部决不会愿意充当一个官僚主义者或主观主义者，只是由于没有很好地联系群众、联系实际，因而才沾染上官僚主义、主观主义的毛病。平顺县给我们做出了一个克服官僚主义、主观主义的榜样，大家应当很好地向他们学习。
