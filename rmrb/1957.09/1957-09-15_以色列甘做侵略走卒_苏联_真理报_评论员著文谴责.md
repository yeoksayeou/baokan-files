Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: A "Pravda" commentator wrote on the 13th that the provocative actions of the Israeli ruling clique against neighboring countries have attracted the attention of the broad international public.

The commentator asked why Israel would pursue such a reckless and adventurous policy of aggression in the Near East, and willingly act as a tool for foreign imperialist forces pursuing colonialist goals? He pointed out that the primary reason is that the policies of the ruling clique of Israel since the founding of the country have been guided by reactionaries with extreme nationalism and chauvinistic sentiments. These people have long been linked to the imperialist monopoly capital of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany.

The commentator pointed out that the policies of the Israeli ruling clique harbor dangerous consequences for the survival of Israel itself, because this policy relies on historically condemned colonialist forces and is a provocation against the people of the East, the defenders of peace and the security of all countries. This policy of the Israeli government grossly violates the principles of the United Nations Charter. The Israeli ruling clique should bear serious responsibility for the consequences of Israel's current adventurous policies. The colonialist blocs of the United States and other Western countries should also be held responsible for this situation, because they have instigated Israeli extremists to carry out provocations against Syria and other Arab countries.

　　以色列甘做侵略走卒
　　苏联“真理报”评论员著文谴责
    据新华社讯  塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”评论员13日写道，以色列统治集团对邻国的挑衅行动引起广大国际公众的注意。
    评论员问道，为什么以色列会在近东执行狂妄、冒险的侵略政策，并且自甘充当追求殖民主义目的的外国帝国主义势力的工具呢？他指出，首要的原因是以色列这个国家的统治集团的政策从建国以来就是由具有极端民族主义和沙文主义情绪的反动派指导的。这些人同美、英、法、西德的帝国主义大垄断资本很早就有联系。
    评论员指出，以色列统治集团的政策对于以色列本国的生存包藏着危险后果，因为这种政策指靠的是受历史谴责的殖民主义势力，并且是对东方人民，对和平和各国安全的保卫者的挑衅。以色列政府的这种政策粗暴地违反联合国宪章的原则。以色列统治集团应当对以色列目前冒险政策的后果负严重的责任。美国和其他西方国家的殖民主义集团也应当对这种情况负责，因为他们唆使以色列极端分子对叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家进行挑衅。
