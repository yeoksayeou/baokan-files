    To Be a Working-Class Intellectual
        (I)
    The vast majority of young students, precisely because we have neither been tempered by practical class struggle, nor have we seriously studied Marxism-Leninism and carried out thorough ideological remolding, have a very poor ability to distinguish right from wrong. When Qian Duansheng, the president of our college and a rightist element, appeared to care about our image, many students were poisoned by his venomous arrows.
    After Qian Duansheng's anti-Party crimes were exposed, most of these misled students woke up one after another, examined their past mistakes, and immediately plunged into the battle against the rightists; however, a few people were still slow to act. But on the other hand, many students immediately threw themselves into the battle against the rightists from the very beginning of the anti-rightist struggle. Why would such a big difference arise among students? This is mainly because some people resolutely stand on the proletariat's position and observe problems from the proletariat's interests, while others start from the bourgeois individualistic standpoint, and therefore made mistakes.
    In order to establish a proletarian world outlook, we must seriously study Marxism-Leninism, constantly and unremittingly remold non-proletarian ideology, and actively participate in practical life. The universal opening of the course "Socialist Education" in all grades of colleges and universities across the country is a prescription for the disease of our young students, and I firmly support the opening of this course. Beijing University of Political Science and Law, Wang Yingrong
        (II)
    In this anti-rightist struggle, I deeply felt my lack of strength, especially my very little understanding of theoretical knowledge. Therefore, at the beginning of the movement, I showed hesitation and was even sometimes confused by their flowery words, which led to a loss of fighting spirit.
    Now, the course "Socialist Ideological Education" is to be universally added to colleges and universities to educate the new generation of Chinese youth in the actual revolutionary struggle. I guarantee that in my future studies, I will work hard to delve into my studies, strictly demand myself, and be sure to become a college student with knowledge, education, and a communist outlook on life.
        Student of Peking University, Wei Qinghao

    要做工人阶级知识分子
    	（一）
    绝大多数青年学生，正因为我们既没有受过实际的阶级斗争的锻炼，又没有认真地学习马列主义和进行彻底的思想改造，所以分辨是非的能力很差。当我院院长、右派分子钱端升以关心我们的面貌出现，许多同学中了他的毒箭。
    当钱端升的反党罪行被揭发后，这些被迷惑的学生大部分，纷纷觉悟，检查了过去的错误，立即投入了反对右派的战斗；也有少数人还迟迟不动。但另一方面，也有不少同学自反右派斗争开始时，他们就立即投入了反对右派的战斗。为什么同是学生竟会产生这样大的差别呢？这主要是：一些人坚决地站在无产阶级的立场上，从无产阶级的利益出发，来观察问题；而另一些人则是从资产阶级的个人主义的立场上出发，所以犯了错误。
    为了建立无产阶级的世界观，就必须认真地学习马列主义，经常不懈地改造非无产阶级思想，积极参加实际生活锻炼。在全国高等学校各年级普遍开设“社会主义教育”这门课，就是针对我们青年学生的病症开的一个药方，我坚决拥护这一课的开设。	北京政法学院王英容	（二）
    在这次反右派斗争中，我深深地感到自己力量的不足，尤其是理论知识更是懂得极少，因此在运动一开始，自己就表现了彷徨，甚至有时被他们的花言巧语所迷惑，以致失去了斗志。
    现在要普遍在高等学校增设“社会主义思想教育”这门课，要在实际的革命斗争中去教育新中国的青年一代。我保证在今后的学习中努力钻研，严格要求自己，一定要做一个有知识、有教养、具有共产主义人生观的大学生。
        北京大学学生韦清豪
