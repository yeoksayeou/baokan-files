Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 14th: The Japanese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, led by Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, left Tokyo by plane tonight for New York.

With the support of the United States, the Japanese government is preparing to seize a non-permanent seat on the Security Council at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, and will also put forward a "new proposal" to ban nuclear weapons. In order to win the Security Council seat that traditionally belongs to Eastern European countries, Japan has already engaged in activities with many countries in advance to request their support.

    日外务相赴美出席联大
    新华社14日讯  东京消息：由外务相藤山爱一郎率领的日本出席联合国大会的代表团，今天晚上乘飞机离开东京前往纽约。
    在美国的支持下，日本政府准备在这届联合国大会上夺取安全理事会非常任理事国的席位，并且要提出禁止核武器的“新提案”。为了争取在传统上属于东欧国家的安全理事会的席位，日本在事先已经向许多国家进行活动要求支持。
