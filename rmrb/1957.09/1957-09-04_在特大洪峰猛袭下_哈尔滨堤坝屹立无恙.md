Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd -- The second Songhua River and Nen River flood peaks have converged in the Songhua River and begun to violently assault Harbin. At present, Harbin is facing the serious threat of an unprecedented extraordinary flood.

Today at 5:00 PM, the water level on the Harbin river surface had risen to 120.15 meters, exceeding last year's highest flood level by 9 centimeters. The water level is still continuing to rise. Even so, all the city's dikes are standing firm.

The city's 129-kilometer urban and suburban dikes, reinforced and raised by 1.3 million person-times, have generally been raised to 121.70 meters, about one and a half meters higher than the current water level. Sandbags and burlap sacks filled with earth have been used to build dike walls resembling fortresses along the edges of the critical dikes, using a total of 1.76 million sandbags and 510,000 burlap sacks. Currently, wave-breaking log rafts extending for twenty kilometers have been deployed along the front of all critical dikes. Flood control personnel are using three newly built 3.5-kilometer-long urban soil transportation railways to continuously transport soil directly to the dikes. Motorized emergency rescue boats loaded with flood control materials are stationed along various river sections, ready to be dispatched for emergency rescue at any time.

Today, phenomena such as water seepage and slope collapse on the city's critical dikes have slightly increased compared to the past, but they have all been promptly dealt with by emergency rescue teams. The railway line leading to Manzhouli on the Sino-Soviet border was damaged by the flood last night and is currently being repaired. International trains and passenger and freight trains were notified in advance, and no accidents occurred.

    在特大洪峰猛袭下
    哈尔滨堤坝屹立无恙
    新华社哈尔滨3日电　第二松花江和嫩江两股洪峰已经在松花江汇合，开始猛袭哈尔滨。目前哈尔滨市正遭受着历史上从未有过的特大洪水的严重威胁。
    今天下午五时，哈尔滨市江面水位已上升到一二○·一五公尺，超过去年最高洪水位九公分。水势仍在继续上涨中。虽然这样，全市堤坝都屹立无恙。
    全市一百二十九公里的市区和郊区大堤，经一百三十万人次的加固加高，堤身一般都加高到一二一·七○公尺，比目前水位高出一公尺半左右。在险要的大堤边缘都用装上土的草袋和麻袋垒成像堡垒似的堤墙，总共用去一百七十六万只草袋和五十一万只麻袋。现在所有的险要堤坝前沿都布设了长达二十公里的防浪木排。防汛人员利用新建的三条三点五公里长的市区运土铁路，不断地把泥土直接运上了堤坝边。沿江各地段停放了满载防汛器材的机动抢险船，准备及时出动抢险。
    今天，全市险要堤坝上渗水、脱坡等现象比过去略有增加，但都被抢险队员及时抢救出险。通往中苏边境满洲里的铁路线在昨晚被洪水冲坏，现在正在抢修中。国际列车和客货车都事先接到通知，未发生任何事故。
