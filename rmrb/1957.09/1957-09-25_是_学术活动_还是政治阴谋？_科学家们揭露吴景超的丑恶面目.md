Is it "Academic Activity" or a Political Conspiracy?
Scientists Expose Wu Jingchao's Ugly Face

    At the anti-Rightist struggle forum held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, scientists waged reasoned struggle against rightists such as Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Zhenhan, Chen Da, and Li Jinghan, exposing and criticizing their anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracies.
    Wu Jingchao's article, entitled "Does Sociology Still Have a Place in New China?" published in the January issue of the "New Construction" magazine, was the first shot fired by the Rightists to restore bourgeois sociology. The philosopher Guan Feng said that Wu Jingchao's article was written illogically and did not address the topic; this was done intentionally by Wu Jingchao. For example, Wu Jingchao raised the issue of the abolition of sociology departments in several universities during the restructuring of departments, but instead of opposing it directly, he took a detour, saying that in old sociology, there were eight courses, such as population theory and statistics, and social surveys, which could be offered in various departments of the university. Then Wu Jingchao said that these eight items in the old sociology should be studied based on "historical materialism knowledge." May I ask: Since problems like population theory and statistics, and social surveys are studied using historical materialism knowledge, then what does this have to do with "old sociology"? If these problems are to be studied on the basis of historical materialism, then the question of whether it has a place or not simply does not arise. Isn't Wu Jingchao deliberately confusing the public and deceiving readers here? Guan Feng also pointed out many similar examples to illustrate the tricks Wu Jingchao employed in this article.
    Lin Yushi, an editor of "Philosophical Research" magazine, focused on analyzing Wu Jingchao's reactionary article "Improving the Quality of Suggestions from Democratic Parties," published in "Journal of the CPPCC," pointing out that Wu Jingchao's suggestion in this article to establish "Policy Research Committees" in various democratic parties was the ideological basis for Zhang Bojun's later proposal of a "Political Design Institute." Wu Jingchao's attack on the national data confidentiality system at the State Statistical Bureau's symposium was precisely to realize his claim that the Communist Party should "provide democratic parties with sufficient information on major issues happening at home and abroad at any time." The anti-socialist science program of the Zhang-Luo alliance was the first masterpiece designed by the Policy Research Committee, which Wu Jingchao personally participated in, and Zhang Bojun's "Political Design Institute." All of this shows that Wu Jingchao talks about so-called academic activities but in reality seeks to achieve his ulterior political motives.
    To illustrate why Wu Jingchao's reactionary stance was so firm, Mai Nong, a teacher at Renmin University of China, and Yan Zhongping, deputy director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cited the facts that Wu Jingchao had been vigorously serving imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang for nearly thirty years. Mai Nong said that after Wu Jingchao returned to China in 1928, he wrote many pamphlets on sociology to attack Marxism, vigorously promoting the reactionary idea that the working class should not touch the capitalist system, saying that "a so-called fair society can be achieved without eliminating classes," and maliciously slandering Marxism's theory of proletarian revolution as "obviously wrong." In addition, Wu Jingchao used "sociology" as a theoretical basis to create anti-communist and anti-people public opinion and offer advice for the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek group. Based on the experience of capitalist countries in suppressing workers' movements, he suggested that the Kuomintang reactionary regime adopt the two methods of "compulsory investigation" in Canada and "compulsory mediation" in Italy to carry out bloody suppression of the revolutionary workers' movement. Wu Jingchao also used the reactionary population theory as a "theoretical" weapon to undermine the land revolution, saying that the poverty of Chinese peasants was due to overpopulation, and even inhumanly suggested using methods of epidemics, hunger, and war to eliminate the population, reducing China's population to 200 million. When Chiang Kai-shek launched the fifth offensive against the revolutionary base areas in October 1933, Wu Jingchao clamored, "Apart from the method of military unification, we cannot see any other way to realize the mission of unification." But when the People's Revolutionary War was about to win nationwide victory in 1948, Wu Jingchao turned around and advocated so-called "rationalism," slandering the people's revolution as "irrational behavior," which "includes slaughter, terror, and coercion." He tried every means to obstruct the victory of the people's revolution.
    Yan Zhongping said that before liberation, Wu Jingchao vigorously promoted comprador and slavish ideas, defending the imperialist plunder of China. Wu Jingchao published an article entitled "On Foreigners Establishing Factories in China" in the New Economic Magazine in October 1942, saying, "When foreigners establish factories in China, 85% of the profits are paid to our government and people, while they themselves can only get 15%. Therefore, I say that we not only welcome the factories that have already been established in China to continue operating in China, but also welcome new foreign factories to be established in China in the future." He even shamelessly insisted that the establishment of factories by imperialism would not only not hit national industries, but would also allow national industries to get the "benefit of learning and improvement without feeling the oppression" from foreign factories.
    Sun Benwen, a professor at Nanjing University who had long been engaged in the study of old sociology, used his own experience to discuss the reactionary essence of bourgeois sociology and so-called social surveys at the meeting. He pointed out that bourgeois sociology, whether from a general theory or specific issue investigation, serves the interests of the bourgeoisie and the capitalist system. He said that the spread of bourgeois sociology in China has had a very bad effect on the dissemination of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary thought and the development of our people's revolutionary cause.

### 是“学术活动”还是政治阴谋？  科学家们揭露吴景超的丑恶面目

    是“学术活动”还是政治阴谋？
    科学家们揭露吴景超的丑恶面目
    在中国科学院召开的反右派斗争座谈会上，科学家们对费孝通、吴景超、陈振汉、陈达、李景汉等右派分子进行说理斗争，揭发和批判他们的反共反社会主义阴谋。
    吴景超发表在“新建设”杂志一月号上的题为“社会学在新中国还有地位吗？”的文章，是右派为资产阶级社会学复辟放出的第一枪。哲学家关锋说，吴景超的这篇文章写得文不对题和不合逻辑，这是吴景超故意这样做的。例如，吴景超在他的文章里，提出院系调整时取消若干大学的社会学系的问题，但他不从正面来反对，却拐了一个弯，说是在旧社会学中，有人口理论及统计、社会调查等八个课程可以分别在大学里的各系开课。接着吴景超说，旧社会学中的这八个项目，要以“历史唯物论的知识为基础”来进行研究。试问：像人口理论和统计、社会调查这样的问题，既然用历史唯物论的知识来研究，那么这又和“旧社会学”有什么关系呢？如果这些问题，要在历史唯物主义的基础上进行研究，那就根本不发生什么有没有地位的问题。吴景超在这里不是故意混淆视听，欺骗读者吗？关锋还指出许多类似的例子，来说明吴景超在这篇文章里所施展出来的伎俩。
    “哲学研究”杂志编辑林聿时着重分析了吴景超发表在“政协会刊”的“提高民主党派建议的质量”这篇反动文章，指出吴景超在这篇文章中提出的要在各民主党派成立“政策研究委员会”的建议，正是章伯钧后来提出“政治设计院”的思想基础。吴景超在国家统计局的座谈会上大肆攻击国家的资料保密制度，正是为了实现他的要共产党“对国内国外发生的重大问题，随时供给民主党派以足够的资料”的主张。章罗联盟的反社会主义科学纲领，正是吴景超亲自参加的政策研究委员会和章伯钧的“政治设计院”设计出来的第一个杰作。所有这些，都说明吴景超口口声声谈论所谓学术活动，实际上都是为了达到他的不可告人的政治目的。
    为了说明吴景超的反动立场为什么如此坚定，中国人民大学教师麦农、中国科学院经济研究所副所长严中平举出了吴景超在近三十年当中极力为帝国主义、为国民党反动统治服务的事实。麦农说吴景超在1928年回国后，写了许多关于社会学的小册子来攻击马克思主义，大肆宣扬工人阶级不要去触动资本主义制度的反动思想，说“所谓公平的社会，是不消灭阶级也可以达到的”，并且恶意诬蔑马克思主义关于无产阶级革命的学说“显然是不对的”。另外，吴景超又以“社会学”作为理论根据，为蒋介石反动集团制造反共反人民的舆论和出谋献计，他根据资本主义国家镇压工人运动的经验，建议国民党反动政权采用加拿大的“强迫调查”和意大利的“强迫调解”两个方法来对革命的工人运动施行血腥的镇压。吴景超还搬出反动的人口论作为破坏土地革命的“理论”武器，说是中国农民的贫困是因为人口太多，甚至灭绝人性地提出不惜用瘟疫、饥饿、战争的方法来消灭人口，使中国的人口减少到两亿。吴景超当蒋介石在1933年10月向革命根据地发动第五次进攻时，曾经大肆叫嚣“除却武力统一的方式外，我们看不出有什么别的方式可以实现统一的使命”。但是到了1948年人民革命战争即将获得全国胜利的时候，吴景超却反过来提倡所谓“理性论”，污蔑人民革命是“反理性的行为”，是“包含残杀、恐怖与强制”。千方百计企图阻挠人民革命的胜利。
    严中平说，吴景超在解放前曾经大肆宣扬买办洋奴观点，为帝国主义对中国进行掠夺作辩护。吴景超在1942年10月的新经济杂志上发表一篇“论外人在华设厂”的文章，说“外人在华设厂，其事业之所得，以85％付与我国政府和人民，而自己只能得到15％。所以我说，我们不但欢迎过去已经在华开设的工厂，继续在华开工，而且欢迎将来还有新的外厂在华设立。”他甚至厚颜无耻地硬说帝国主义的设厂不但不会打击民族工业，而且会使民族工业得到外厂“切磋琢磨之益，而不感到其压迫”。
    曾经长期从事旧社会学研究的南京大学教授孙本文用他自己的体验，在会上论述了资产阶级社会学和所谓社会调查的反动本质。他指出，资产阶级社会学无论从一般理论或具体问题的调查来说，都是为资产阶级的利益服务、为资本主义制度服务的。他说，资产阶级社会学在中国的传播对于马克思列宁主义革命思想的传布，对于我国人民革命事业的发展都起了很坏的作用。
