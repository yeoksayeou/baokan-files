Introduction to the person

    General Stoph, Head of the Military Delegation of the German Democratic Republic
    Willi Stoph, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic, who led the military delegation of the German Democratic Republic to visit our country on September 4, comes from the working class. He was born in Berlin on July 9, 1914. After graduating from elementary school, he learned the trade of a bricklayer and worked as a foreman and construction technician. In 1928, Comrade Stoph joined the German Communist Youth League, and in 1931, he joined the German Communist Party. During the period of the brutal rule of German Fascism, Comrade Stoph carried out anti-fascist underground work, actively striving to liberate the German people from the shackles of Hitler's Fascism.
    After the glorious Soviet army achieved a great victory in the anti-fascist war in 1945, he was responsible for the work during the period of restoring the economy in eastern Germany, which had been destroyed by the fascist war. Later, he was appointed as the Minister of the Economic Policy Department of the Guidance Department (later the Central Committee) of the German Socialist Unity Party. In 1950, Comrade Stoph was elected to the Central Committee of the Party at the Third Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party. In 1952, he served as the Minister of Interior of the German Democratic Republic. From 1953, he was elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, and from 1954, he served as the Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.
    In January 1956, when it became necessary to establish the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic to defend the socialist achievements of the first German worker-peasant state due to the re-militarization of West Germany, Comrade Stoph was appointed as the Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic.
    From this time on, Comrade Stoph has carried out significant work to defend the German Democratic Republic and the socialist achievements of the working people.
    General Stoph has been awarded the Gold Patriotic Order of Merit of the German Democratic Republic and has received numerous awards from the Armed Forces of the German Democratic Republic. (Attached picture)
