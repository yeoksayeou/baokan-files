    据新华社天津5日电　天津市副市长李华生说，天津市的工业生产总值、基本建设投资、社会商品零售总额等许多项目，都提前一年超额完成了第一个五年计划所规定的任务。
    在4日开幕的天津市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上，李华生作了“关于天津市1956年度国民经济计划执行情况和1957年度国民经济计划的报告”。报告说，1956年是天津市国民经济全面高涨的一年，在对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方面，已取得了决定性的胜利。地方工业的发展速度超过了以往的任何一年，其总产值比1955年增长35.85％；手工业总产值增长44.61％。中央在五年计划中下达的二十七种主要产品，已有十七种提前一年达到或超过五年计划的指标。
    天津市在第一个五年计划内的基本建设投资总额，预计将超过国家下达计划42.14％；其中工业投资占三分之一，超过以往任何年代。在第一个五年计划期间，天津市根据勤俭建国的方针扩建和新建的工厂，有天津市机床厂、新兴钢厂、“一六○五”农药厂、玻璃纸厂、七星摄影器材厂等四百三十个单位。
    在第一个五年计划期间，天津市的城市建设、文教卫生事业等，都有很大的发展。人民物质生活也有了显著的改善。1957年全市居民购买力将比解放初期1950年提高约三倍，比1952年提高50％左右。几种主要的商品销售量都有很大增长。如粮食增加35.98％，猪肉增加73.2％。其他如衬衣、棉服、毛线、棉毛衫等的销量，分别增加了一倍到五倍。
