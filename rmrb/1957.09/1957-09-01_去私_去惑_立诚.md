    Eliminate Selfishness, Resolve Doubts, Establish Sincerity
    Zeng Bingjun, Professor of Beijing College of Political Science and Law

    In the past few years since liberation, the vast majority of intellectuals have accepted reform and studied diligently. However, since Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals was presented last year, calling for advancement in science, some new situations have emerged among intellectuals. Many people, in order to advance in science, have turned to focus solely on professional work, relaxing their ideological awareness. In addition, a small group of people have been blinded by profit, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws. Old habits of bourgeois literati, such as arrogance, self-importance, and mutual flattery, have gradually reappeared in these individuals. This situation is no exception in the field of political science and law.

    During the rectification movement, the activities of right-wing elements in the field of political science and law were not sufficiently alert to by most people at the time. The anti-Party fallacies of figures like Yang Yuqing and Chu Anping were relatively easy to identify, but other right-wing remarks and conspiracies involving certain departments were difficult for the general public to judge due to a lack of understanding of the situation. Only after the start of the anti-rightist struggle did people gradually awaken. I myself was one of those with dull political senses.

    What shocked me most, due to my close personal contact with them, was the exposure of the small clique of Qian Duansheng, Lou Bangyan, and Wang Tieya. According to the revealed facts, until recently, they were still, like before liberation, engaging in petty sectarianism, praising and citing each other, being arrogant and self-important, fighting for power and profit, and seizing territory. This even developed to the point of attempting to break away from the Party's leadership, readjust the departments of political science and law, and plan to establish an independent kingdom, namely a large law school in the style of the London School of Economics and Political Science.

    Their unscrupulous two-faced tactics were also very alarming. Qian Duansheng enjoyed the trust of the people, but at the same time, he corresponded with U.S. special agent Fairbank. Wang Tieya and Lou Bangyan publicly admitted the class nature of political science and law, but secretly maliciously slandered leading comrades in political science and law, believing that the claim of class nature was merely an excuse for factionalism. They professed to support the Party and even applied to join the Party, but behind the scenes, they undermined the Party's prestige, conspired to exclude the Party's leadership in the field of political science and law, and everywhere cried injustice for former legal scholars, believing that judicial reform had condemned these people outright. They attempted to win over some old legal scholars in this way to strengthen their own forces. Qian Duansheng, who was usually arrogant and domineering, actually visited everywhere during the rectification period, encouraging free airing of views. Lou Bangyan, who appeared progressive, incited his subordinates to engage in great democracy, advocating that the free airing of views within the judicial organs be moved to the streets! If these and other absurd remarks and actions had not been exposed in person and admitted by them personally, it would have been almost unbelievable. However, whether you believe it or not, the irrefutable facts are there. For people like me, this is truly another extremely profound political education. It turns out that this group of revolutionary followers cloaked in progressive garb are a group of bourgeois rightists with undying ambitions, two-faced, capable of overturning events, and harboring ulterior motives!

    What particularly surprised me was that they were secretly discussing the so-called plan for a large law school. This cannot but remind me of the difficult situation of the political and legal departments of several old universities in Beijing before the readjustment of departments. With the change of state power, political science and law, as a superstructure of society, faced many difficulties in curriculum reform; there was no certainty whether the trained students would be practical; the number of students decreased daily, and learning was unstable; the old set of knowledge of the teachers was no longer suitable, and a new system had not yet been established, leading to a sense of bewilderment and distress. Such a paralyzed state could not be resolved in a short time. At that time, the only way out was to seek the support of the government's political and legal departments and strengthen leadership. Otherwise, the predicament of the political and legal departments would be difficult to escape. This is the personal experience of those of us engaged in old political and legal education. The readjustment of departments rescued us from our difficulties, giving us a great opportunity to learn from scratch and the possibility of serving the people's political science and law cause anew on a new basis. We should sincerely thank the Party and the government for their wise measures. What I find strange is that this group of "heroes" who were once "anxious and troubled" before the readjustment of departments are so forgetful that they still ambitiously dream of overturning the readjustment of departments of political and legal education! This is truly a stubborn faction's ignorant delusion of overestimating their own abilities and not recognizing the objective world!

    However, upon further reflection, considering the history, background, education, and usual ideological style of the figures in this small clique, it is not surprising that they have exposed such reactionary right-wing remarks and actions today, blinded by profit. They usually put on airs, considered themselves extraordinary, and always proceeded from the idea of facilitating selfish plans for fame and status. In the old days, they unscrupulously sought official positions, but because they did not receive the favor of the reactionary leaders, they did not climb to the apex of their political ambitions. Qian Duansheng sought several times to become the Kuomintang's ambassador abroad but failed; Wang Tieya requested to be an assistant to a director in the pseudo-foreign ministry, but the reactionaries could only give him a section chief; Lou Bangyan, unwilling to be a university professor, shamelessly joined the bandit Hu Zongnan's subordinates as a colonel instructor two years before liberation! They were so reactionary in the past, and after liberation, they actively followed in the ranks of progress, receiving the Party's tolerance and care, and in recent years, they gradually became complacent again. Their biggest problem is that they have not undergone genuine reform. Their selfish hearts and the "I" that did not know its own limitations have continued to expand invisibly with the Party's promotion. Their fame and status are already much higher than before liberation, but they are still very dissatisfied, not regarding the Party's preferential treatment as expectations for them, but presumptuously believing that they have extraordinary achievements and that the Party cannot but value them and therefore cannot but accommodate them. Thus, they further pursued only profit and power, raising their tails higher and higher, and their desire for power and position grew larger and larger. Under the myriad connections of the right-wing group, they inevitably embarked on the path of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. This is the thread of their ideological evolution until today, and it is also the process of their degeneration into right-wing elements. Their example is a vivid lesson for the vast number of senior intellectuals. This lesson tells us how dangerous a path the development of bourgeois individualism can lead people down without thorough reform!

    Indeed, their exploitative class family background and bourgeois reactionary education may be two important factors in their crimes. In these two aspects, the situation of many senior intellectuals is largely the same. This is something that many of us should deeply reflect on. However, the vast majority of people have not degenerated into right-wing elements after years of Party education. This is not without reason. The reason lies in the fact that upright people who seek progress absolutely believe in the Party from their personal experience, truly rely on the Party, and recognize that China only has a bright future by taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Party. Under this accurate understanding, they do not sacrifice personal interests to harm the interests of the people and the Party, and they did not engage in private capital "fishing in troubled waters" in the current political storm. In this regard, the development of right-wing elements has a major divergence from that of ordinary intellectuals.

    We have built our country for eight years, and the country's development has been very rapid. Many intellectuals usually work at their desks, not stepping out of the research laboratory. After the economic foundation of society has changed and the relations of production have basically entered socialism, many people have not yet entered socialism ideologically. Their sense of right and wrong and their sense of justice enable them to distinguish themselves from right-wing elements. This is indeed an important fact and the basic aspect. However, in this rapidly changing society, most of them are not without shortcomings. Some unhealthy parts of their thinking can still provide a market for right-wing remarks to take advantage of. For example, we have a tendency to pursue scholarship for the sake of scholarship, detached from politics, and right-wing elements shout slogans such as "democratic school management," "Party and League withdraw from schools," and "defend scientists"; we have arrogance or aloofness, and right-wing elements clamor not to undergo ideological reform, saying that the Party should treat intellectuals with courtesy and make repeated visits to invite them; we have sectarianism and selfish and self-interested thoughts, and right-wing elements use personal relationships, engage in petty cliques, and conduct ideological collusion; some of us who have studied old political science and law have not yet seriously criticized the old set of things, and right-wing elements shout that judicial reform is wrong and want to "recall the souls" of old legal studies; in addition, we have old democratic ideas, and right-wing elements sow discord between the Party and the masses, falsely accusing the Party's leadership of being a "Party world," and saying that "the pens of intellectuals are naturally against the status quo"! Since right-wing elements can use people's backward side and target certain weaknesses in people's thinking to put forward slogans to win over the masses, this explains many problems, indicating that our political senses are not so high in the great storm, and sometimes we even inevitably echo some of their wrong remarks. These situations are not accidental. Approaching a deep abyss as if walking on thin ice, this is precisely what many of us intellectuals should deeply guard against.

    History is constantly advancing, and the storms of political struggle are always inevitable in the process of social revolution. If intellectuals do not combine with workers and peasants and do not thoroughly reform their thinking, attempting to sell individualistic private goods under the banner of socialism, they will eventually be abandoned by history.

    Ideological reform is a process of self-education. In view of the mistakes made by right-wing elements, intellectuals must do three things to thoroughly reform. First, they must recognize the objective world, recognize themselves, and truly recognize the Party and the inevitable trend of history. This seems to be known to everyone, but it is something that many people have not done. If a person truly recognizes the greatness of the Party, his old democratic ideas will be resolved.

    Second, they must conscientiously eliminate individual selfishness and self-interest. At a minimum, they must consider personal interests in the interests of all the people and cannot put individuals before everything else, dreaming of stealing chickens and dogs or claiming kingship and hegemony in a society where everything belongs to the public. This is also the crux of the serious crimes committed by right-wing elements. Many people often unknowingly go astray on this issue, and this is the most difficult hurdle to overcome.

    Finally, they must be honest and trustworthy, be loyal to objective reality, loyal to the people, loyal to the Party, and loyal to their own conscience, propositions, words, and actions. They must not call a deer a horse, lie against their conscience, or be inconsistent in word and deed, hoping to deceive for a while. This is even more fundamentally impossible for the two-faced right-wing elements. I call the first point "resolving doubts," the second point "eliminating selfishness," and the last point "establishing sincerity." If everyone can "cultivate their words and establish their sincerity," it will not be easy to confuse right and wrong.

    Intellectuals must basically possess these three ordinary and minimum conditions in order to truly combine with workers and peasants, be ideologically reformed and liberated, master dialectical materialism, stand firm, withstand political storms, and become revolutionary intellectuals, red scientists, and fighters on the proletarian ideological front. Otherwise, his progress will still be unconsolidated and superficial.

    Today, if right-wing elements want to save themselves from not cutting themselves off from the people, they must confess their crimes, repent, thoroughly explain their problems, and then honestly start over as people and fundamentally reform themselves. Our vast number of intellectuals must be able to pass the socialist test well, be reborn and truly serve the people well, and we must also all accept the political education of the anti-rightist struggle, unite closely around the Party, and further reform our thinking.

    去私·去惑·立诚
    北京政法学院教授  曾炳钧
    解放几年来绝大多数的知识分子是接受改造虚心学习的。但自去年周总理提出对知识分子问题的报告、号召向科学进军以后，在知识分子中间又出现了一些新情况。许多人为了向科学进军转而专门注意业务，放松了思想问题。另外一小撮人则利令智昏，张牙舞爪。狂妄自大、权威自居、互相吹捧等资产阶级文人的老毛病又在这些人身上逐渐显露出来。这种情况在政法学界也不例外。
    整风运动中政法学界右派分子的活动，多数人在当时没有十分警惕。杨玉清、储安平之流反党的谬论比较容易识别，但其他涉及某一部门的右派言论及阴谋策划，一般群众不了解情况，就一时难于判断。只有在反右派斗争开始以后，才逐渐醒悟起来。我自己也就是这类政治嗅觉迟钝的人们中间的一个。
    与我在人事上有较密接触而最使我触目惊心的无过于钱端升、楼邦彦、王铁崖这个小集团的揭露了。从揭发的事实看，直到最近他们还和解放前一样，搞小宗派，互相标榜援引、狂妄自大、争权夺利、霸占地盘，一直发展到企图摆脱党的领导，实行政法院系再调整，筹划建立一个独立王国，即伦敦经济政治学院式的大法学院。
    他们肆无忌惮的两面派手法也是很惊人的。钱端升受人民的信任，却同时与美国特务费正清通讯。王铁崖楼邦彦公开承认了政法科学的阶级性，却背地对政法领导同志恶意丑诋，认为阶级性的说法只不过宗派主义的借口。他们口口声声拥护党而且还申请入党，但背地里却破坏党的威信，阴谋在政法学界排斥党的领导，并四处为旧法学人员呼冤叫屈，认为司法改革对这些人是一棍子打死。他们企图这样来拉拢一些旧法学人员，壮大自己的势力。平昔盛气凌人的钱端升在整风期间竟四出拜访，鼓动鸣放。貌似进步的楼邦彦则煽动他的部下搞大民主，主张把司法机关内的鸣放搬到街头！以上种种和其他荒唐言行，假如不是有人当面揭发，并经他们亲口承认，几乎使人难于置信。然而不管你信与不信，无可辩驳的事实就摆在那里。对于我这样的人来说，这真是又一次极其深刻的政治教育。原来这班披着进步外衣的革命追随者却是一群野心不死的资产阶级右派，表里不一，翻云复雨，别具肝肠！
    尤其让我特别惊诧的是他们竟然窃窃私议着所谓大法学院的策划。这不能不使我回想到院系调整以前北京几个旧大学的政治法律学系的艰窘情况。国家政权变革了，作为社会上层建筑的政法科学在课程改革中有不少困难；训练的学生能否切合实用茫无把握；学生人数日减，学习不安定；教师的旧学一套已经不适用了，新的体系还未建立，感到徬徨与苦闷。这样一个瘫痪状态，不是一时所能解决得了的。当时唯一的出路是争取政府的政法部门的支持，加强领导。否则政治法律学系进退维谷的困境很难摆脱。这是我们从事旧政法教育的人亲历其境的切身经验。院系调整把我们这班人从困难中解救了出来，有从头学习的大好机会，再有可能在新的基础上从新为人民的政法科学事业服务，我们应该衷心感谢党和政府措置的英明。我所奇怪的是这班在院系调整前一度“皇皇如也”的“英雄”们如此健忘，今天竟还野心勃勃梦想对政法教育的院系调整大翻案！这真是顽固派不自量力不认识客观世界的无知妄想！
    但是再稍一回想，联系这个小集团人物的历史、出身、教育与平昔的思想作风，他们今天暴露了这种反动的右派言行，利令智昏，也是不足为怪的。他们平时装腔作势，自命不凡，一切总是从便利私图名誉地位的思想出发，在旧时代不择手段地钻营禄位，只是因为得不到反动头子的青睐才没有爬上他们政治野心的顶点。钱端升几度求为国民党的驻外大使而不可得；王铁崖要求作伪外交部一个司的帮办，但反动派只能赏给一个科长；楼邦彦呢，舍大学教授不作竟在解放两年前靦颜投靠到胡匪宗南的部下作一名上校教官！过去如此反动不堪，解放后大事活动追随在进步的队伍里，得到了党的宽容和照顾，近年又逐渐得意忘形起来。他们最大的问题在于没有得到真正的改造。他们那颗个人自私的心与不知自量的“我”，随着党的提拔又在无形中不断膨胀，他们的名誉地位已经比解放前高多了，但他们还很不满足，不把党的优遇看作对他们的期待而妄自认为他们有过人的成就、党不能不器重也就不能不迁就。于是更进一步唯利是图，唯力是视，尾巴翘得愈高，权位的欲望愈来愈大，在右派集团千丝万缕的牵连之下就不可避免地走上了反党反社会主义的道路。这是直到今天他们思想演变的线索，也是他们堕落为右派分子的过程。他们的事例正是广大高级知识分子一个生动的教训。这一教训告诉我们，没有彻底的改造，资产阶级个人主义思想的发展可以引导人们走向何等危险的途径！
    不错，他们剥削阶级的家庭出身与资产阶级的反动教育，可能是他们所犯罪过的两点重要因素。在这两方面许多高级知识分子的情况也大抵相同。这是我们许多人应当深刻反省的。但绝大多数人几年来经过党的教育却不曾堕落为右派分子。这不是无原因的。原因在于要求进步的正直的人们从切身的经验绝对相信党，真正依靠党，认识到中国只有在党领导下走社会主义的道路才有光明的出路。在这个确切的认识之下不把个人利益去损害人民的利益和党的利益，没有在当前政治大风浪中搞私人资本“混水摸鱼”，在这点上右派分子的发展是与一般知识分子有重大分歧的。
    我们建国经过了八年，国家的发展很快。知识分子中间有不少人平素伏案工作，足迹不出研究实验室一步。在社会的经济基础已经改变、生产关系已基本上进入社会主义之后，许多人思想上还未进入社会主义。他们的是非心正义感使他们能自别于右派分子，诚然这是一个重要事实，是基本的方面。但在这个急剧变革的社会里他们多数人也不是没有缺点的。他们思想中某些不健康的部分也还是可以为右派言论乘虚而入提供市场的。譬如我们有为学术而学术，脱离政治的倾向，右派分子便高喊“民主办校”、“党团退出学校”、“保卫科学家”；我们有自高自大或清高思想，右派分子便叫嚣不要思想改造，说什么党对知识分子应该礼贤下士、三顾茅庐；我们有门户之见自私自利的思想，右派分子便利用私人关系，搞小集团，进行思想串连；我们一些学过旧政法科学的人有的对旧的一套还没有进行认真批判，右派分子则大叫司法改革搞错了，要为旧法学“招魂”；此外，我们有旧民主思想，右派分子便挑拨党群关系诬蔑党的领导是“党天下”，并说什么“文人的笔杆天然是反现状的”！右派分子既可以利用人们落后的一面，针对人们思想上的某些弱点来提出口号争取群众，这就说明了不少问题，说明了在大风浪中我们的政治嗅觉不那么高，有时甚至不免附和他们的某些错误言论，这种种情况并不是偶然的。临深履薄，这也正是我们许多知识分子应该深自警惕的。
    历史不断前进，在社会革命的过程中政治斗争的风浪总是少不了的。知识分子如果不与工农结合、不彻底改造自己的思想，企图在社会主义的旗帜下来贩卖个人主义的私货，终于要为历史所抛弃。
    思想改造是一个自我教育的过程。鉴于右派分子所犯的错误，知识分子要彻底改造，必须做到三点。首先必须要认识客观世界，认识自己，真正认识党，认识历史的必然趋势。这一点似乎是尽人皆知的，但却是许许多多的人所没有做到的。假如一个人真认识了党的伟大就解决了他的旧民主思想问题。
    其次，必须要认真铲除个人的自私自利思想，最低限度必须把个人的利害放在全体人民的利益中间来考虑，不能把个人放在一切的前面，妄想在天下为公的社会里偷鸡盗狗或称王称霸。这也是右派分子所犯严重罪过的症结所在。许多人在这个问题上常常不知不觉间便走入了歧途，这一关是最不容易过的。
    最后，必须忠诚老实，要忠实于客观实际，忠实于人民，忠实于党，忠实于自己的良心、主张和言论行动。不能指鹿为马，昧着良心说瞎话，或表里不一，希图蒙混一时。这更根本不是右派分子两面派所能做到的了。以上三点，我把第一点叫做“去惑”，第二点叫做“去私”，最后一点叫做“立诚”。人人都能“修辞立其诚”，是非也就不易混淆了。
    知识分子必须基本上具备了这三个平凡的起码条件才能真正与工农结合，才能从思想上得到改造和解放，才能掌握辩证唯物主义、站稳立场、经得起政治上的风吹雨打，也才能做一个革命的知识分子、红色的科学家和无产阶级思想战线上的战士。否则他的进步将仍是不巩固的和表面的。
    今天右派分子要想挽救自己不自绝于人民，就必须认罪悔改，彻底交代问题，然后老老实实从新作人，从根本上改造起。我们广大的知识分子要能很好地过社会主义这一关，脱胎换骨真正为人民很好服务，也必须大家一起接受反右派斗争的政治教育，紧密团结在党的周围，进一步地改造思想。
