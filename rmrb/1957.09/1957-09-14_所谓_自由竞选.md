The So-Called "Free Election"
    "Free Election" Relies on Money

    Tomorrow, September 15th, West Germany will hold a general election. In the past few months, the West German parties have engaged in fierce election campaigns. In capitalist countries, they are accustomed to glorifying this kind of activity as "free election," but in reality, the election relies on large sums of money and has nothing to do with so-called "freedom." For example:

    A political party must use money to buy public opinion and conduct election propaganda. In the last federal parliamentary election, the Christian Democratic Union sent a promotional postcard to each of the 15 million households in West Germany, and also sent a "condolence" postcard to each of the 5 million pensioners. The postage for these two items alone cost 635,000 marks.

    According to incomplete statistics from the 1953 general election, the campaign expenses of the three major parties were approximately: Christian Democratic Union, 9 million marks; Free Democratic Party, 3 million marks; Social Democratic Party, 2 million marks. A total of 14 million marks.

    The Bosses Pay the Bills

    Such a large sum of money cannot be raised by the political parties themselves. Therefore, the election expenses of the various political parties must rely on "donations." These "donations" can be divided into direct funding and indirect funding. Whether it is direct funding or indirect funding, the capitalists are the ones who can afford to pay large sums of money. Therefore, "donations" become a means for the bosses to control the political parties.

    There are many kinds of funding. For example, the Bavarian Wholesale and Foreign Trade Economic and Political Association stipulated that each member should extract 50 to 80 pfennigs from every 10,000 marks of sales as campaign funds to be donated to bourgeois political parties. Last year, the Düsseldorf United Bank, Volkswagen, and some large companies in the Ruhr industry donated 4.5 million marks to the Christian Democratic Union under the guise of subscribing to the Christian Democratic Union's publication "Economic Overview." This belongs to a disguised form of direct funding.

    In addition, there is indirect funding, which is mainly collected and distributed by legally defined "promotion associations" and "national political associations." These institutions are actually controlled by representatives of large monopolies. For example, the big banker, Christian Democratic Union member of parliament, Adenauer's backstage boss Feldmenger, and the secretary-general and president of the "German Industry Federation" and the "German Industry and Commerce Federation" are all heads of these associations.

　　The Money Cannot Be Given Away for Nothing

    Of course, it is impossible for capitalists to spend such a large sum of money for nothing. The Bavarian Wholesale and Foreign Trade Economic and Political Association admitted in a letter calling on members to donate money to bourgeois political parties that they donated to these political parties because these bourgeois political parties had strongly urged "the Federal Parliament to support certain wholesale and export companies' requests." The articles of association of the "Promotion Association" clearly stipulate that political parties must support "free market economy" in order to obtain funding. In other words, the political parties that get the money must serve the interests of the capitalists.

    In the 1953 general election, the "Promotion Association" gave the Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party campaign funds amounting to 12 million marks, and also gave some to the Social Democratic Party.

    When the Free Democratic Party withdrew from the government alliance last year, the "Promotion Association" and the "National Political Association" tried to stop subsidizing the Free Democratic Party, which was a kind of restrictive action against the Free Democratic Party.

    Double the Subsidy to Adenauer This Year

    This year, Adenauer is in a bad situation, so the bosses have spent extra money to campaign for him. The West German "Der Spiegel" magazine once revealed that the West German monopoly groups decided in a meeting a few months ago to give Adenauer twice as much money as in the 1953 general election. And the actual amount given seems to be even more than expected. West Germany's largest monopoly capital organizations—the Industrialists' Association and the West German Wholesalers' Association—have given Adenauer's party tens of millions of marks. In addition, banks, insurance companies, and landlords have also given Adenauer's party tens of millions of marks. (Lin Sheng)

### 所谓“自由竞选”

　　所谓“自由竞选”
    “自由竞选”靠金钱
    明天，9月15日，西德就将举行大选。在过去几个月里，西德各政党进行了激烈的竞选活动。在资本主义国家，惯于把这种活动美其名为“自由竞选”，但是实际上竞选要靠大笔大笔的钱来进行，与所谓“自由”没什么相干。例如：
    一个政党要收买舆论，要作竞选宣传等等都必须用钱。在上次联邦议会选举中，基督教民主联盟向西德一千五百万户居民每户寄了一份宣传邮片，还给五百万名领养老金者每人寄了一份“慰问”邮片，单单这两项的邮费就花了六十三万五千马克。
    据1953年大选时不完全统计，三个主要政党的竞选经费约为：基督教民主联盟九百万马克；自由民主党三百万马克；社会民主党二百万马克。共计一千四百万马克。
    出钱的是老板
    这样一大笔费用，各个政党自己是拿不出来的。因此，各政党的竞选费用就必须依靠“捐助”。这种“捐助”可分直接资助和间接资助两种。无论是直接资助或者间接资助，毕竟出得起大钱的是资本家，因此“捐助”就成为老板们控制政党的一种手段。
    资助的花色繁多。例如巴伐利亚批发和对外贸易经济政治协会曾规定，每个会员在一万马克的销售额中抽出五十到八十芬尼，作为捐给资产阶级政党的竞选经费。而去年杜赛尔多夫联合银行、人民汽车厂及一些鲁尔工业的大公司，则以订阅基督教民主联盟出版的“经济概观”为名，捐助了基督教民主联盟四百五十万马克。这是属于变相的直接资助。
    此外还有间接资助，主要由法定的所谓“促进协会”和“国家政治总会”等负责收集和分配。这些机构实际上由大垄断企业的代表掌握的。例如，大银行家、基督教民主联盟议员、阿登纳的后台老板费尔德门格斯及“德国工业总会”和“德国工商业总会”的秘书长和会长都是这些协会的负责人。
　　钱不能是白出的
    资本家拿出这样大笔的钱，当然决不可能是白白花费的。巴伐利亚批发与对外贸易经济政治协会在号召会员捐钱给资产阶级政党的一封信中就承认，他们捐助这些政党是为了这些资产阶级政党曾经力促“联邦议院支持了某些批发和出口公司的要求”。在“促进协会”的章程里明文规定政党要支持“自由市场经济”才能获得资助，换句话说就是，得钱的政党得为资本家的利益服务。
    在1953年大选时，“促进协会”给基督教民主联盟和自由民主党的竞选经费达一千二百万马克，另外也给了社会民主党一些。
    当去年自由民主党退出政府联盟时，“促进协会”和“国家政治总会”曾要停止对自由民主党的津贴，就是对自由民主党的一种约束行动。
    今年加倍津贴阿登纳
    今年，阿登纳处境不佳，因此老板们出了特别多的钱来为他竞选。西德“明镜”杂志曾经透露，西德大垄断集团在几个月以前开会决定，要给阿登纳比1953年大选时多一倍的钱。而实际给的数目看来比预定的还要多。西德最大垄断资本组织——工业家联合会和西德批发商组织都给阿登纳党数以千万计的马克。此外，银行、保险公司和地主们也给了阿登纳党好几千万马克。（林生）
