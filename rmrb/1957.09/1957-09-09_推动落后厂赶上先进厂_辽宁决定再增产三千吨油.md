Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th - Fifty-eight oil factories under the jurisdiction of Liaoning Province are actively taking measures to strive to increase oil production for the country by more than 3,000 tons by the end of this year.

The Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry recently inspected forty-four manual oil pressing factories, and only eight factories achieved the national planned standard for oil extraction efficiency. The difference in oil extraction efficiency between advanced and backward factories is very large. In terms of oil yield, one hundred catties of raw materials can differ by two catties of oil. According to research, the main reason is that some factories have not promoted advanced experience well. Therefore, in the second half of this year, it has been decided to continue to promote the experience of "small-circle thin cake oil pressing" and strengthen technical management. Factories throughout the province are preparing to transfer a group of technical workers to the Fushun Oil Factory for technical rotation training to focus on learning the basic principles of Li Chuanjiang's operation method and the experience of small-circle thin cake oil pressing.

There are also many new oil sources in the Liaoning area. In addition to rice bran and corn germ, which can be used for oil extraction, many wild plant oil materials have been discovered throughout the province. After testing and trial pressing, four varieties can be utilized: cocklebur seeds, prickly ash, green hemp seeds, and safflower seeds. Among them, prickly ash has the highest oil content, reaching more than 35%, and the oil quality is very good, and it can be used as high-grade industrial oil. In the second half of this year, the factories plan to develop 8,265 tons of various new oil sources, which can extract 634 tons of oil.

### 推动落后厂赶上先进厂  辽宁决定再增产三千吨油

    推动落后厂赶上先进厂
    辽宁决定再增产三千吨油
    新华社沈阳7日电　辽宁省属五十八个制油厂正在积极采取措施，争取到今年年底为国家增产油脂三千多吨。
    辽宁省工业厅最近检查了四十四个人力榨油厂，其中只有八个厂的出油效率达到国家计划标准。先进工厂和落后工厂之间的出油效率高低相差很大，表现在出油率上，一百斤原料就能相差两斤油。据研究，主要原因是有些工厂没有很好推广先进经验。因此，今年下半年决定继续深入推广“小圈薄饼榨油”的经验和加强技术管理工作。全省各工厂准备抽调一批技术工人，到抚顺市油脂厂进行技术轮训，集中学习李川江操作法的基本原理和小圈薄饼榨油经验。
    辽宁地区还有很多新油源，除了米糠、玉米胚芽等可以用来榨油外，全省还发现了许多野生植物油料。经过化验和试榨证明可以利用的有苍耳籽、山花椒、青麻籽、红花籽等四个品种。其中，山花椒含油量最高，达到35％以上，油品质量很好，可以做高级的工业用油。今年下半年各厂计划开辟各种新油源八千二百六十五吨，这样就能榨出六百三十四吨油脂。
