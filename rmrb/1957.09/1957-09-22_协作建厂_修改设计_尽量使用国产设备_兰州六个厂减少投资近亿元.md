    Joint Plant Construction, Revised Designs, Maximize the Use of Domestic Equipment
    Six Factories in Lanzhou Reduce Investment by Nearly 100 Million Yuan

    (Our report) According to the Gansu Daily, six large industrial construction units in the Lanzhou area have earnestly implemented the policy of "building the country diligently and thriftily, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily" during plant construction. Preliminary calculations show that they can save and reduce national investment by nearly 100 million yuan. With these funds, the state can build three more cotton spinning mills with 80,000 spindles each, or a thermal power plant with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts.

    These large industrial construction units have cooperated and coordinated in various aspects during plant construction. The Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Factory and the Lanzhou Petroleum Refining and Chemical Equipment Factory have decided to merge twelve construction projects that were originally planned to be built separately by the two factories, including steel casting, iron casting, forging and heat treatment, gas generating station, and garage. It is estimated that this will save 15 million yuan in investment. This will not only greatly improve equipment utilization, but also reduce future production costs by 7%. After determining cooperation between the repair workshop of the Lanzhou Rubber Factory and the repair workshop of the Lanzhou Fertilizer Factory, the Lanzhou Rubber Factory cancelled its casting workshop, and the oxygen plant planned to be built by the Lanzhou Refinery this year was also cancelled.

    The architectural designs of these factories have been modified based on the characteristics of the Lanzhou area, while ensuring quality and maintaining the advanced designs of the Soviet Union, saving the country funds and building materials. According to the climate conditions in Lanzhou, the Lanzhou Fertilizer Factory cancelled the plant buildings for the shift conversion, copper washing, and desulfurization sections, and changed them to open-air production. The columns, crane beams, and steel roof trusses of some plant buildings with steel structures were changed to prestressed reinforced concrete and ordinary reinforced concrete structures to replace steel. The overhead pipeline supports with steel structures at the Lanzhou Refinery and the machine tool bases with steel structures at the machine repair factory were also changed to reinforced concrete structures. These two items alone can save more than 400 tons of steel.

    Each unit has also postponed or cancelled projects that are not currently needed based on actual conditions. For example, the Lanzhou Petroleum Refining and Chemical Equipment Factory has tentatively decided to postpone the construction of two factory buildings for the processing shop and auxiliary shop based on the development of the national machinery manufacturing industry. Part of the product parts and mechanical repair tasks will be temporarily undertaken by the processing shop and auxiliary shop of the Petroleum Machinery Factory, which can reduce investment by more than 19 million yuan. The Zhengjiazhuang Power Plant, which was originally planned to be expanded to supply heat for the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Factory and the Lanzhou Petroleum Refining and Chemical Equipment Factory, was replaced by the two factories jointly investing 4 million yuan to build a boiler room for heat supply, reducing the 30 million yuan investment in the expansion of the Zhengjiazhuang Power Plant.

    Some units are studying the full utilization of domestic equipment. The Lanzhou Fertilizer Factory has decided to change more than 200 sets of chemical equipment and more than 240 automatic control instruments that were planned to be ordered from abroad to be processed and ordered domestically, which is expected to save more than 2.5 million yuan in foreign exchange.

### 协作建厂　修改设计　尽量使用国产设备  兰州六个厂减少投资近亿元

    协作建厂　修改设计　尽量使用国产设备
    兰州六个厂减少投资近亿元
    本报讯　据甘肃日报报道：兰州地区六个大工业建设单位在建厂中，认真贯彻了“勤俭建国，勤俭办企业”的方针，初步计算能给国家节约和减少投资将近一亿元。国家利用这些资金可以多建三座八万纱锭的棉纺厂或建一座十万瓩的火电站。
    这几个大工业建设单位，在建厂中从多方面协作配合。兰州石油机械厂和兰州炼油化工设备厂把计划两厂分建的铸钢、铸铁、锻造热处理、煤气发生站和汽车库等十二个工程项目确定合并建筑，预计能节约投资一千五百万元。这不仅充分提高了设备利用率，而且可使将来的生产成本降低7％。兰州橡胶厂的修配车间与兰州肥料厂的修配车间确定协作之后，兰州橡胶厂取消了铸造车间，兰州炼油厂今年计划建设的氧气厂也取消了。
    这几个工厂的建筑工程设计根据兰州地区的特点，在保证质量及保持苏联先进设计的原则下进行了修改，为国家节约了资金和建筑材料。兰州肥料厂根据兰州气候情况，取消了变换、铜洗、脱硫三个工段的厂房，改为露天生产，并把部分厂房钢结构的柱子、吊车梁和钢屋架等都改为预应力钢筋混凝土和普通钢筋混凝土结构来代替钢材。兰州炼油厂钢结构的架空管道支架和机修厂钢结构的机床座等，也都改成了钢筋混凝土结构。仅这两项就能节约四百多吨钢材。
    各单位还根据实际情况把目前不需要的工程缓建或者取消了。如兰州炼油化工设备厂根据国家机器制造工业的发展情况，初步确定把加工场和辅助工场的两幢厂房缓建，一部分产品配件和机械修配任务暂由石油机械厂的加工场和辅助工场来承担，这样可减少投资一千九百多万元。原计划为兰州石油机械厂、兰州炼油化工设备厂供热而要扩建的郑家庄发电厂，由两厂花四百万元投资合建一座锅炉房来供热，削减了扩建郑家庄发电厂的三千万元的投资。
    有些单位正在研究充分利用国产设备。兰州肥料厂已决定把计划在国外订货的二百多台化工设备和二百四十多件自动控制仪表，改为在国内加工订货，预计能节约外汇二百五十多万元。
