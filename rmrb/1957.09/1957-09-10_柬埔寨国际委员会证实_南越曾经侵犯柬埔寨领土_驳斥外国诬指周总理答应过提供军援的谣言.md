Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The International Commission for Cambodia recently submitted its fifth working report. The report describes the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Cambodia from October 1, 1955, to December 31, 1956, and the work of the International Commission.

In its report, the International Commission, in addition to describing the Royal Government of Cambodia's implementation of Article 6 of the Geneva Accords regarding the guarantee of no reprisals against any of its citizens and their families, focused on the implementation of Article 7 (accepting foreign military assistance), Article 13(c) (the International Commission's supervision of foreign military personnel and war materials entering Cambodia as foreign aid), and Article 21 (foreign armed forces invading or threatening the territorial integrity of Cambodia).

The report pointed out that during the aforementioned one year and three months, the Commission received seven letters from the Royal Government notifying it of seventeen incidents that occurred on the border between Cambodia and South Vietnam. In addition, the Governor of Svay Rieng province also reported an incident of South Vietnamese invasion of Cambodian territory.

These incidents can be divided into the following four categories:

(1) South Vietnamese soldiers entered Cambodian territory and used force.

(2) South Vietnamese troops attempted to occupy Cambodian islands and spread propaganda about such islands belonging to South Vietnam.

(3) In addition to South Vietnamese troops, armed or unarmed South Vietnamese civilians infiltrated Cambodian territory.

(4) South Vietnamese troops assembled on the South Vietnamese border.

In addition, the International Commission also received notification from the Royal Government regarding allegations that Thai authorities were increasing military strength and improving strategic highways within Thai territory on the Cambodia-Thailand border.

The Royal Government pointed out to the Commission that Cambodian troops had suffered casualties as a result of these attacks. The Commission's investigation into the incident reported by the Governor of Svay Rieng province confirmed that some South Vietnamese nationals had invaded Cambodian territory.

On the other hand, the report pointed out that the relationship between Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has developed very well through the assistance of the International Commission. The relationship between the two countries is very harmonious. Prince Sihanouk, on behalf of the Cambodian people, expressed his understanding and friendly sentiments to the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Regarding the issue of foreign military assistance, the Commission's report pointed out that the United States remains the main source of war materials entering Cambodia. The Commission also received a statement from the Royal Government refuting the slander spread abroad that Premier Zhou Enlai had promised to provide Cambodia with military assistance during his visit to Cambodia, proving that this rumor was baseless.

    柬埔寨国际委员会证实
    南越曾经侵犯柬埔寨领土
    驳斥外国诬指周总理答应过提供军援的谣言
    新华社10日讯　柬埔寨国际委员会最近提出了第五次工作报告。报告叙述了1955年10月1日到1956年12月31日在柬埔寨实施日内瓦协议的情况和国际委员会的工作。
    国际委员会在报告中除叙述了柬埔寨王国政府在实施日内瓦协议第六条关于保证不对任何国民及其家属采取任何报复的规定的执行情况外，着重地谈到了关于第七条（接受外国军事援助问题）、第十三条丙款（国际委员会对进入柬埔寨的作为外援的军事人员和战争物资进行监察问题）和第二十一条（外国武装部队侵犯或威胁柬埔寨的领土完整问题）的执行情况。
    报告指出在上述一年零三个月内，委员会收到了王国政府七封信，通知它关于柬埔寨同南越之间边境上所发生的十七起事件。此外，柴桢省省长也报告了一件关于南越侵犯柬埔寨领土的事件。
    这些事件可分为下列四类：
    （一）南越士兵进入柬埔寨领土并使用了武力。
    （二）南越部队企图占领柬埔寨岛屿，并散布关于此类岛屿属于南越的宣传。
    （三）除了南越军队以外，武装或非武装的南越平民渗入柬埔寨领土。
    （四）南越军队在南越边境集结。
    此外，国际委员会还收到王国政府关于指控泰国当局在柬泰边界的泰国境内增加军事力量和改进战略公路的通知。
    王国政府曾向委员会指出，由于这些袭击，柬埔寨部队曾遭受人命损失。委员会对柴桢省省长所报告的事件的调查证实某些南越国民曾经侵入柬埔寨领土。
    另一方面，报告指出柬埔寨同越南民主共和国之间的关系通过国际委员会的协助有很好的发展。两国关系非常融洽。西哈努克亲王曾代表柬埔寨人民向越南人民军总司令部表示谅解和友好的情意。
    关于外国军事援助问题，委员会的报告指出，美国仍然是进入柬埔寨的战争物资的主要来源。委员会还曾收到王国政府针对在柬埔寨国外所散布的诬指周恩来总理访柬时曾答应提供柬埔寨军事援助而发表的辟谣声明，证明这一谣传是毫无根据的。
