Refute His Anti-Communist Fallacies Expose His Reactionary Scandal
    The Ministry of Water Resources Pursues Liu Yaozhang
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Water Resources recently held seven general meetings of all staff members to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Liu Yaozhang, a key rightist element. Liu Yaozhang was Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), and the chairman of the RCCK branch in the Ministry of Water Resources. After the start of the rectification movement, he launched a blatant attack on the Communist Party. He opposed the practice of the Party Group of the Ministry of Water Resources to study some major issues in advance and then submit them to everyone for discussion. He tried every means to sow discord between the Party and the masses. He said: "Party members have a sense of mystery, especially those in the personnel department, so everyone respects ghosts and gods and keeps away from them." "When talking to Party members, it is better to say less than to say more, and better to say nothing than to say less." He also said: "Eat better, dress worse, stay away from Party members, shout 'Long live!' louder."
    At these meetings, many people refuted Liu Yaozhang's anti-communist fallacies. Zhang Hanying (water conservancy expert), Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, refuted Liu Yaozhang, saying: "I have attended the Party Group meetings of the ministry. The Party Group's discussion of issues is very detailed and serious, and there has been prior investigation and research. Every time I participate in a Party Group meeting, I receive a profound education. The reason why our revolutionary cause and various constructions have achieved such great results is inseparable from this kind of leadership. Prior study of issues is the Party's leadership responsibility. What is there to criticize?"
    Liu Yaozhang also wantonly attacked the socialist construction cause. He flatly denied the role of water conservancy construction in increasing agricultural production in recent years. He also deliberately downplayed the achievements of the Huai River harnessing project, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal and other projects. Regarding these fallacies of Liu Yaozhang, Liu Zhongrui (first-class engineer), Director of the Engineering Department, and Wang Sen, Deputy Director, both refuted them with specific facts. They cited that the Kuomintang reactionaries spent twenty years in power, used the British Boxer Indemnity, and issued tens of millions of yuan in public bonds, but only opened a Zhongshan River with a flow of less than 400 cubic meters per second. The People's Government's eight years of Huai River harnessing achievements have ensured that floods occurring once in fifty years no longer cause harm. With the irrigation main canal and the control of Hongze Lake, it has been guaranteed that 25 million mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu will have a bumper harvest every year. How can these great achievements be downplayed? They questioned Liu Yaozhang: "Do you have a conscience? Why do you distort the facts with your eyes closed?"
    Liu Yaozhang also echoed Luo Longji, Huang Shaohong, and others in attacking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. He even opposed the necessary review of certain people with complicated histories, denouncing it as "nervousness." He also distorted the fact that the Ministry of Water Resources had arrested the wrong people in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. Comrade Sun Shi of the Personnel Department listed the handling process of the nine counter-revolutionaries and bad elements who were arrested by the Ministry of Water Resources in accordance with the law during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, explaining that none of them were arrested wrongly. Cheng Yuangeng and Han Beiping both used their personal experiences to explain that it was entirely necessary to review the history of certain people. Han Beiping said: "In order to clarify my historical issues, the organization sent people to run around most of China, investigated more than 100 relationships, and finally made a conclusion, which relieved me of my burden." He questioned Liu Yaozhang: "Can you distort such ironclad facts?"
    The meeting revealed that Liu Yaozhang usually pretended to be active on the one hand, and used opportunities to slander the Communist Party on the other. Comrade Yun Liancheng revealed that after participating in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Liu Yaozhang had slandered the world-renowned heroic and invincible Chinese People's Volunteers as a group of cowardly and fearful mobs. According to the exposure of comrades Cui Zaizhi, Liu Naiji, Ma Yi, Zhi Nanping, etc., Liu Yaozhang was originally a Kuomintang party hack who started his career by being anti-Soviet and anti-communist. Because he was both resolutely anti-communist and good at running around and currying favor, he climbed to high-level reactionary positions such as Kuomintang Central Committee member, chairman of the Kuomintang Hebei Provincial Party Department, pseudo-Hebei Provincial Speaker, and pseudo-Beiping Mayor. Comrades Lin Shubin and others accused Liu Yaozhang of jointly planning the "July 5th" massacre of Northeastern students in Beiping before the liberation, together with Xu Huidong (pseudo-Beiping Municipal Speaker) and Chen Jicheng (pseudo-Garrison Commander). They demanded that he explain how many students were killed. Many people also demanded that he explain: Why did Liu Yaozhang send his wife and daughters to Taiwan during the period when the peaceful liberation of Beiping was being negotiated? What was the content of the letter written to Chen Cheng? What were his plans for pretending to be a hypocrite after liberation?

### 驳倒他的反共谬论  揭开他的反动丑史  水利部追击刘瑶章

　　驳倒他的反共谬论  揭开他的反动丑史
    水利部追击刘瑶章
    本报讯　水利部最近连续举行七次全体工作人员大会，对右派骨干分子刘瑶章的反动言行进行揭发和批判。刘瑶章是水利部部长助理、全国政协委员、民革候补中委、民革水利部支部主委，他在整风运动开始以后，对共产党进行了露骨的进攻。他反对水利部党组对一些重大问题事先研究而后交给大家讨论的做法。他千方百计地挑拨党和群众的关系。他说：“党员有神秘性，特别是人事部门的，所以大家就敬鬼神而远之”。“对党员说话多说不如少说，少说不如不说。” 还说：“要吃得好些，穿得烂些，见党员躲远些，喊万岁、喊得响些。”
    在这几次大会上，很多人对刘瑶章的反共谬论进行了驳斥。水利部副部长张含英（水利专家）驳斥刘瑶章说：“我列席过部里的党组会，党组对问题的讨论是很细致很认真的，而且事先有过调查研究的，我每参加一次党组会就受到一次很深的教育。我们的革命事业和各项建设所以有这样大的成绩，是和这种领导分不开的，对问题的事先研究是党的领导责任，这有什么可以指摘的呢？”
    刘瑶章还肆意攻击社会主义建设事业。他一口否定了几年来的水利建设对农业增产的作用。并有意抹煞治淮、苏北灌溉总渠等工程的成就。对于刘瑶章的这些谬论，工务司司长刘钟瑞（一级工程师）和副司长王森都用具体事实进行了驳斥。他们举出：国民党反动派执政二十年，使用了英国的庚子赔款，发行了数千万元公债，结果只开了一条流量不到四百秒公方的中山河。人民政府八年的治淮成绩，保证了五十年一遇的洪水不再为害。有了灌溉总渠和对洪泽湖的控制，保证了苏北二千五百万亩农田年年丰收，这些伟大成就如何抹煞得了。他们质问刘瑶章：“你有良心吗？为什么闭着眼睛歪曲事实？”
    刘瑶章还和罗隆基、黄绍竑等互相呼应，攻击肃反运动。他甚至反对对某些历史复杂的人进行必要的审查，辱骂这是“神经过敏”，他还歪曲说水利部在肃反中捕错了人。人事司孙石同志列举水利部在肃反中依法逮捕的九个反革命分子和坏分子的处理经过，说明没有一个是捕错了的。程元赓和韩北平都以自己的亲身感受说明对某些人的历史进行审查完全必要。韩北平说：组织上为了弄清我的历史问题，曾派人跑了大半个中国，调查了一百多个关系，最后做出结论，使我放下了包袱。”他质问刘瑶章：“这样铁的事实你能歪曲得了吗？”
    会上揭露：刘瑶章在平时就一面伪装积极，一面利用机会污蔑共产党。云连成同志揭露：刘瑶章在参加抗美援朝运动后，曾把举世公认英勇无敌的中国人民志愿军，诬蔑说是一群胆小、怕死的乌合之众。据崔载之、刘乃济、马毅、智南屏等同志的揭发，刘瑶章本来就是一个以反苏反共起家的国民党党棍。由于他既坚决反共，又善于奔走逢迎，一直爬上了国民党中央委员、国民党河北省党部主任委员、伪河北省参议长、伪北平市长等高级反动职位。林树彬等同志控诉刘瑶章在北京解放前，伙同许惠东（伪北平市参议长）、陈继承（伪警备司令）等共同策划了屠杀东北学生“七·五”大惨案。要他交代到底杀死多少学生。许多人还要他交代：为什么正当谈判和平解放北京的时期，刘瑶章却把自己的妻子、女儿都送往台湾？给陈诚写的信是什么内容？解放后装扮成一个伪君子有些什么打算？
