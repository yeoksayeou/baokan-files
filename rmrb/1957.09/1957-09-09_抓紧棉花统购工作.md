Grasp Cotton Unified Purchase Work Tightly

Cotton has now begun to be picked and is being put on the market for sale successively. The peak season for purchasing cotton is about to arrive. In order to do a good job in this year's unified purchase of cotton, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have issued instructions requiring the Party committees and People's Committees of all cotton-producing areas to make specific arrangements for the unified purchase of cotton immediately, seize the peak season for cotton purchase, organize forces from all sides, mobilize the masses, and step up the picking and purchasing of cotton, and be sure to complete the unified purchase of cotton in a short period of time.

In the cotton production year from September 1956 to August 1957, cotton production suffered relatively serious natural disasters, resulting in a decrease in cotton production compared to the previous year. However, the amount of cotton purchased by the state decreased by a greater amount than the decrease in production compared to the previous year. This shows that the reduction in cotton purchases is not only due to the disaster situation, but also due to the acquisition work itself. Because cotton was not purchased well enough, it greatly affected the production of yarn and cloth, which not only affected the country's fiscal revenue to a certain extent, but also prevented the people from being supplied with cloth according to the original standards.

Although the area of ​​cotton fields this year has decreased somewhat compared to last year, the cotton production situation in most areas is good. If no serious natural disasters occur in the next month, as long as the work is done conscientiously, the state will be able to purchase more cotton. In order to purchase more cotton in cotton-producing areas, all localities must combine the socialist debate being carried out in the countryside to carry out in-depth socialist propaganda and education work, launch the struggle between the two lines of socialism and capitalism, help cotton farmers strengthen their overall concept, establish a unified ideology of loving the country, loving the society, and loving the family, criticize the capitalist ideas of some cotton farmers who retain more and sell less and attempt to sell cotton at high prices on the free market, and persuade them to sell more good cotton to the state and actively support the country's socialist construction, so as to realize the goal of building the country diligently and thriftily on the basis of managing the household diligently and thriftily and running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. We must also vigorously overcome one-sided mass viewpoints and departmentalism among cadres, which is also the key to smoothly carrying out cotton purchase work and ensuring the completion of the cotton unified purchase task.

This year's cotton purchase work should be carried out on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses and earnestly implementing the measures stipulated in the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. The rule that cotton farmers can retain three catties of cotton per person is no longer fully applicable to the current situation. Under normal circumstances, each person can only retain two catties of cotton. If it is indeed difficult to reduce it to two catties in a few concentrated production areas, it can be reduced a little less, but the amount of cotton retained per person cannot exceed two and a half catties. In this way, although the total amount of cotton retained in rural areas is less than the abnormal situation in 1956-1957, it is still more than the normal situation in 1955-1956. Therefore, as long as the agricultural cooperatives do a good job in the regulation of cotton, the cotton retained in the countryside is sufficient.

In order to increase the amount of cotton purchased under unified purchase, all cotton-producing areas must strengthen the leadership of cotton picking work and resolutely prevent waste. Agricultural cooperatives must strictly check the quality of cotton picking work, pick up all the cotton, sell more to the state, and increase income. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the management of local spinning and weaving and the cotton and local cloth markets. Agricultural cooperatives should generally not engage in sideline production using cotton as raw material. Cotton and local cloth can only be sold to commercial departments entrusted by the state and cannot be freely sold on the market. On the principle of practicing thrift and ensuring the essential needs of the people, the supply of cotton batting should also be appropriately reduced. In order to encourage cotton farmers to sell more cotton, the state will give preferential treatment in the supply of extra cotton cloth, that is to say, for every dan of cotton sold by cotton farmers, the state will give a supply of five chi of cotton cloth as a show of preferential treatment.

Now that new cotton has begun to be put on the market, all localities must immediately strengthen the leadership of cotton unified purchase work. Everyone must understand that cotton is an important material related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Everyone has to eat and everyone has to wear clothes. The success or failure of cotton purchase work is directly related to the vital interests of the people throughout the country. At the same time, it also has a significant impact on the production of the textile industry and the country's fiscal revenue. Therefore, the significance of doing a good job in cotton purchase at present has far exceeded the scope of general economic work. It has an extremely important relationship to the improvement of people's lives, the development of the textile industry, and the accumulation of funds for national socialist construction. Everyone must seize the opportunity, work diligently, and strive to do a good job in this year's cotton purchase work, deeply mobilize cotton farmers to sell cotton to the state early and more, and ensure the completion of this year's cotton unified purchase task.

### 抓紧棉花统购工作

    抓紧棉花统购工作
    现在棉花已经开始采摘并且陆续上市出售，收购棉花的旺季就要到来。为了做好今年的棉花统购工作，中共中央、国务院发出了指示，要求各棉产区的党委和人民委员会，立即对棉花统购工作做出专门的部署，抓紧棉花收购的旺季，组织各方面的力量，发动群众，加紧进行棉花的采摘和收购工作，务必在短期内突击完成棉花的统购任务。
    1956年9月到1957年8月这一年度的棉花生产因为遭受了较为严重的自然灾害，以致棉花的产量比上一年度有所减少，但是国家收购的棉花数量，比上一年度减少的数量却大于产量减少的数量。这说明，棉花收购量的减少不仅有灾情上的原因，而且更应该注意到还有收购工作方面的原因。由于棉花收购得不够好，因而在很大程度上影响了纱布的生产，不仅使国家的财政收入受到一定影响，并且使人民用布也不能按照原定的标准供应。
    今年的棉田面积虽然比去年减少了一些，但是现在大部地区棉花生产的情况是良好的，如果在近一个月当中不再发生严重的自然灾害，只要认真做好工作，国家完全有可能多收购一些棉花。为了在产棉区多收购一些棉花，各地必须结合农村中进行的社会主义大辩论，深入地展开社会主义的宣传教育工作，展开社会主义和资本主义两条路线的斗争，帮助棉农加强整体观念，树立爱国、爱社、爱家的统一思想，批判部分棉农多留少卖和企图把棉花拿到自由市场上高价出售的资本主义思想，说服他们多卖好棉花给国家，积极支援国家的社会主义建设，以便在勤俭持家和勤俭办社的基础上，实现勤俭建国的目的。在干部中也必须大力克服片面的群众观点和本位主义思想，这也是顺利开展棉花收购工作和保证完成棉花统购任务的关键。
    今年的棉花收购工作，应该在充分发动群众的基础上，认真执行中共中央、国务院指示中所规定的措施。棉农每人留用三斤棉花的规定，已经不能完全适用于目前了。在现时一般的情况下，每人只能留棉花二斤。少数集中产区如果压缩到二斤确有困难，可以少压缩一点，但是每人的留棉量不能超过二斤半。这样，整个农村留用的棉花数量虽然比1956到1957年度的不正常情况有所减少，但是比之1955到1956年度的正常情况仍然有所增加。所以，只要农业社把棉花的调剂工作作好，农村留下的棉花是够用的。
    为了增加棉花统购的数量，各产棉区必须加强棉花采摘工作的领导，坚决防止发生浪费现象。农业社对于棉花采摘的工作质量必须进行严格的检查，把所有的棉花都采摘起来，多卖给国家，多增加收入。同时要加强对土纺土织和棉花、土布市场的管理。农业社一般不要进行以棉花为原料的副业生产，棉花、土布只能卖给国家所委托的商业部门，不能在市场上自由出售。在厉行节约和保证人民必不可少的需要的原则下，还要适当压缩絮棉的供应量。为了鼓励棉农多卖棉花，国家将给以额外的棉布供应的优惠条件，这就是说，棉农每出售一担棉花，国家就给以棉布五尺的供应量，以示优待。
    现在新棉已经开始上市，各地必须立即加强对棉花统购工作的领导。要使每一个人都了解，棉花是关系到国计民生的重要物资。人人都要吃饭，人人也都要穿衣。棉花收购工作进行得好坏，直接关系到全国人民的切身利益。同时，它对于纺织工业生产和国家的财政收入也都有重大的影响。因此，在目前做好棉花统购工作的意义，已经远远地超出了一般经济工作的范围，它对于人民生活的改善、纺织工业的发展和国家建设社会主义的资金积累等重要方面，都有极为重要的关系。大家必须抓紧时机，兢兢业业，努力做好今年的棉花收购工作，深入地动员棉农早卖和多卖棉花给国家，保证完成今年棉花的统购任务。
