The broad countryside, both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, has launched a great debate centered on the grain issue.

After the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region promulgated new measures for the requisitioning of grain, it aroused ideological resistance among some peasants. Rich peasants and some well-to-do middle peasants clamored that "Socialism even restricts coarse tea and simple meals." Some cadres also had serious departmentalism and right-leaning thoughts.

In response to these situations, a great debate unfolded in the broad countryside. At a meeting of district-level and above cadres convened by the CPC Zepu County Committee, a fierce debate unfolded over whether the grain retention standard was too low. The county committee also organized more than 80 cadres to conduct on-the-spot investigations in agricultural cooperatives regarding the grain consumption of peasants. The facts proved that the grain retention standard stipulated by the prefectural committee was not too low. During the debate in the 4th Township of the 14th District of Shache County, the peasant Abulizi said: "Before liberation, we peasants ate mulberries when mulberries were ripe, apricots after mulberries were finished, and peaches after apricots were finished. It was almost half fruit and half grain for half a year. How could we have so much grain now? We shouldn't forget the pain once the boil is healed!"

Because the peasants' awareness was raised in the great socialist debate, many places completed or even overfulfilled their grain purchase tasks. By September 20, the summer grain requisitioning tasks in Cele, Yutian, Moyu, and Luopu counties had been successfully completed. Shufu, Shule, Yuepu Lake, Jiashi, and Bachu counties had reached more than 95% of their requisitioning tasks. Cele County also purchased an additional 500,000 jin of surplus grain.

### 新疆农民经过大辩论积极卖余粮

    新疆农民经过大辩论积极卖余粮
    本报乌鲁木齐27日电　天山南北广大农村掀起了以粮食问题为中心的大辩论。
    新疆维吾尔自治区颁布征购粮食新的办法以后，引起了一部分农民思想上的抵触。富农和一部分富裕中农叫嚣“社会主义连粗茶淡饭都要限制了。”一部分干部也同样存在着严重的本位主义和右倾思想。
    针对这些情况，广大农村展开了大辩论。在中共泽普县委会召开的区级以上的干部会上，针对留粮标准是否过低展开了激烈的争辩。县委还组织了八十多名干部到农业社实地调查农民的用粮情况，事实证明地委规定的留粮标准并不过低。莎车县十四区四乡在辩论时，农民阿布列孜说：“解放前我们农民桑椹熟了吃桑椹，桑椹完了吃杏子，杏子完了吃桃子，差不多是半年瓜果半年粮，哪有现在这么多粮食。我们不要好了脓疮忘了痛！”
    由于农民在社会主义大辩论中提高了觉悟，不少地方都完成了甚至超额完成了购粮任务。到9月20日，策勒、于阗、墨玉、洛浦等县夏粮征购任务已经顺利完成。疏附、疏勒、岳普湖、伽师、巴楚等县，已达征购任务95％以上，策勒县还增购了五十万斤余粮。
