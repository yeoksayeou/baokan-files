Shanghai universities are taking various measures to actively improve teaching and research work

    (Report from the Liberation Daily) Shanghai's universities and colleges have generally established specialized agencies to study and improve work during the rectification movement.

    In terms of teaching and scientific research, schools have already made many improvements. The East China Institute of Chemical Technology established an academic committee to specifically study and review teachers' academic papers, discuss scientific research directions, and address major issues in teaching. In order to improve the quality of teaching, the First Normal College revised some teaching plans and syllabi, reduced teaching hours, recruited more than fifty teachers, and increased extracurricular activity time. Many schools have added elective courses. For example, this semester the Shanghai First Medical College opened English and Russian elective classes for fourth-year internal medicine and surgery students.

    In terms of cultivating and improving the teaching staff, the East China Institute of Textile Technology formulated "Provisional Measures for Teachers' Further Study and Improvement." The Shanghai Theatre Academy decided to increase opportunities for teachers' professional practice. Regarding student work, schools generally reviewed and adjusted people's scholarships. Regarding the selection of student class leaders, many schools have, from this semester onwards, changed to student self-election.

    In terms of living welfare, the most frequent opinions concerned welfare subsidies. Some schools established special committees to study this, while others improved subsidy methods. Schools are also making efforts to improve issues related to housing allocation, medical and health care, and food management. For example, Fudan University has adjusted the housing of more than fifty households.

    In addition, schools have decided to further study and discuss major issues such as the higher education system.

    上海各高等学校采取多种措施
    积极改进教学和研究工作
    本报讯　据解放日报消息：上海市各高等学校在整风运动中，普遍成立了研究改进工作的各种专门机构。
    在教学和科学研究工作方面，各校已作了不少的改进。华东化工学院成立了学术委员会，专门研究和评审教师的学术论文，讨论科学研究方向及教学上的重大问题。第一师范学院为了提高教学质量，修订了部分教学计划和教学大纲，减少了教学时数，并招聘了五十多位教师，增加了课外活动时间。许多学校增设了选修课程，如上海第一医学院本学期为内科外科四年级学生开设英、俄文选修班。
    在培养和提高师资方面，华东纺织工学院拟订了“教师进修提高暂行办法”。上海戏剧学院确定增加教师业务实践的机会。在学生工作方面，各校普遍检查和调整了人民助学金；对于学生班长的产生，不少学校从本学期起改由学生自己选举。
    在生活福利方面，反映意见最多的是福利费补助问题，有的学校专门成立了委员会进行研究，有的学校改进了补助办法。有关房屋分配、医药卫生、膳食管理等问题，各校也在尽力改进中，如复旦大学已调整了五十多户的住房。
    此外，有关高等学校的体制等重大问题，各校决定进一步研究讨论。
