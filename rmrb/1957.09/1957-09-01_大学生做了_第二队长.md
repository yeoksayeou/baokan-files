　　Lu Yu'an, who lives in the Dole Agricultural Cooperative in Xincheng County, Guangxi, returned from Huazhong Agricultural College during the summer vacation and participated in the cooperative's agricultural labor. Every day, before the sun rose, he was already working in the rice fields with the cooperative members, and in the evening, he returned happily with everyone.

　　Summer harvest and planting is a tense season. Lu Yu'an recognized the great significance of "competing for grain against time, seizing the season, and ensuring a bumper harvest." He took the lead actively, and the cooperative members, encouraged by him, were even more motivated in production. The cooperative members said, "College students returning from Wuhan are being mobilized to rush the harvest, we should be even more energetic!"

　　During the summer vacation, Lu Yu'an not only participated in physical labor, receiving work points like ordinary cooperative members, but also actively promoted the Party's policies to the members, explained the future path of agricultural development in our country, and passed on some of the knowledge he learned at school to the team leader and the members. In addition, he also volunteered to assist the scorekeeper in calculating work points, so that the members could go home to sleep earlier. He also helped the team weigh the grain and helped the production team leader register the various income and expenditure figures. The members all called him "Second Team Leader." Lu Yu'an put down the airs of a college student and diligently contributed everything he had during the summer vacation, leaving a very good impression on the members. Old cooperative member Ying Zhiwu said, "The college students trained by the Communist Party are truly both cultured and skilled, I've never seen anything like it." (Attached picture)

    大学生做了“第二队长”
    韦蕴经
    家住在广西忻城县都乐农业社里的陆玉安，在暑假期间由华中农学院回来，就参加了社里的农业劳动。他每天当太阳还没有升起的时候，就已经在稻田里和社员们一起干起活来了，黄昏时才和大家一起愉快地归来。
    夏收夏种是个紧张的季节，陆玉安认识到“与时争谷、抢上季节、保证丰收”的重大意义，积极带头，社员在他的鼓舞下，生产劲头更大了。社员说，“从武汉回来的大学生都出动抢收，我们更应该紧张起来啦！”
    陆玉安在暑期里，不但参加了体力劳动，同一般社员一样每天得到工分。而且他还积极对社员宣传了党的政策，讲我国今后农业发展的道路，把自己在学校里学习到的一些知识传授给队长和社员。此外，他还主动地到队里协助记分员记算工分，使队员们能提前回家睡眠。他还帮队里秤谷子，帮助生产队长登记各项的收支数字。队员们都称他做“第二队长”。陆玉安放下了大学生的架子，勤劳地在暑期里贡献出自己的一切，给社员留下了很好的印象。年老社员英志武说：“共产党培养的大学生，真是文武双全，这真从来没有见过。”（附图片）
