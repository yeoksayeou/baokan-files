Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd - The coal industry in East China has taken on a completely new look after recovery and development.

According to statistics from the Jinan Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry, during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, 37 pairs of mine shafts were newly built, rebuilt, and restored in East China, with a total designed annual output of over 10 million tons. Among them, the 18 newly built mine shafts can produce more than 7.6 million tons of raw coal annually.

In the Huainan mining area, which is rich in reserves, five pairs of new shafts have been handed over for production so far, greatly increasing production capacity.

The Zaozhuang Coal Mine, which suffered severe damage during the war, has partially started producing coal after three years of vigorous restoration, and will be officially handed over for production by the end of this year.

In the emerging Xinwen mining area, in addition to one pair of new shafts being handed over for production, five more pairs of mine shafts are under intensive construction.

After production reforms, the degree of mechanization and the level of production management of existing production mines have also been significantly improved. The average level of mechanization in various production mines is now one and a half times higher than in 1952. The manual hauling of baskets underground has been completely eliminated, and new coal mining methods have reached over 95%. Due to the improvement in the level of mechanization, the overall efficiency this year is one-third higher than in 1952. It is estimated that the total raw coal output in the entire region this year will increase nearly three times compared to the output in 1949, and more than double the highest annual output during the enemy and puppet period (1941).

Over the past five years, the state has also allocated a large amount of funds to improve the working conditions of miners. Safety mine lamps are now used underground in all mines; the average amount of fresh air received per person per minute on the coal mining face has also exceeded four cubic meters. Coupled with other labor protection facilities, this has greatly reduced casualties.

To improve the living conditions of miners, the state has also built 920,000 square meters of new housing for miners.

### 十八对新矿井年产煤七百多万吨  枣庄煤矿等旧矿井都恢复了青春  华东煤炭工业面貌一新

    十八对新矿井年产煤七百多万吨
    枣庄煤矿等旧矿井都恢复了青春
    华东煤炭工业面貌一新
    新华社济南22日电　华东地区的煤炭工业经过恢复和发展面貌焕然一新。
    据煤炭工业部济南管理局的统计，在第一个五年计划期间，华东地区新建、改建和恢复了三十七对矿井，设计年产量共达一千多万吨。其中新建的十八对矿井，每年就能生产原煤七百六十多万吨。
    在埋藏量丰富的淮南矿区，到目前为止有五对新井移交生产，大大增加了生产能力。
    曾经遭受战争严重破坏的枣庄煤矿，经过三年来的大力恢复，已经部分开始出煤，将在今年年底正式移交生产。
    在新兴的新汶矿区，现在除了有一对新井移交生产以外，还有五对矿井正在加紧施工。
    原有生产矿井经过生产改革以后，机械化程度和生产管理水平也有显著提高。现在各个生产矿井的机械化水平平均比1952年提高一倍半。井底下的人拉筐全部消灭了，新法采煤已经达到95％以上。由于机械化水平的提高，今年的全员效率比1952年提高三分之一。预计今年全区原煤产量，比1949年的产量增加了近三倍，比敌伪时期最高年产量（1941年）也增加一倍多。
    五年来，国家还拨出大量资金改善矿工的劳动条件。现在矿井底下已经全部改用安全矿灯；采煤工作面上平均每人每分钟得到的新鲜风量，也超过了四立方公尺。再加上其他劳动保护设施，因而就使伤亡事故大大减少。
    为了改善矿工的居住条件，国家还为矿工新建住宅九十二万平方公尺。
