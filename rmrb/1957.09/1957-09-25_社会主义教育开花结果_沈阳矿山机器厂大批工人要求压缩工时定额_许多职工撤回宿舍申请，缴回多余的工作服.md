    Socialist Education Bears Fruit
    Large Number of Workers at Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant Demand Reduction of Work Quotas
    Many Employees Withdraw Dormitory Applications and Return Excess Work Clothes
    (Our dispatch) In the upsurge of the enterprise rectification and socialist education movement, a large number of workers at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant have recently taken the initiative to demand the reduction of work quotas.
    For a long time, some of the work quotas in the plant were too lenient and relaxed. At a workers' meeting held in the Third Workshop in early September, more than 40 workers, including Ni Zhengwu and Sun Xichang, requested the leadership to revise parts of the quotas for various products such as coal washing machines and magnetic separators. Many groups in the assembly workshop also took the initiative to review the work quotas for various products and suggested that the leadership quickly formulate reasonable new quotas. For example, the Fifth Group proposed reducing the work quota for assembling cylindrical mixers from 125 hours to 80 hours. The Sixth Group proposed shortening the work quota for assembling gas generators by 20%. Workers operating large boring machines in the Second Metalworking Workshop proposed reducing the quota for processing reducers from 12 hours to 8 hours.
    A new atmosphere has recently emerged in this plant, with many employees taking the initiative to withdraw their applications for dormitories. In the previous period, a total of 734 employees of the plant applied for family dormitories. Recently, after socialist education, employees realized the significance of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, as well as subordinating to the overall interests. 293 employees who wanted family dormitories have voluntarily withdrawn their applications.
    In addition, many workers have returned their surplus work clothes. In the Eighth and Fourth Workshops alone, more than 60 workers returned newly received work clothes, believing that the old ones could still be washed, mended, and worn, and there was no need to receive new ones.

    社会主义教育开花结果
    沈阳矿山机器厂大批工人要求压缩工时定额
    许多职工撤回宿舍申请，缴回多余的工作服
    本报讯　在企业整风和社会主义教育运动的热潮里，沈阳矿山机器厂最近有一大批工人，主动要求压缩工时定额。
    较长时期以来，该厂有一部分工时定额是偏宽偏松的。在三车间9月初召开的职工大会上，就有倪正午、孙希昌等四十多名工人，分别对洗煤机、磁选机等多种产品的部分定额，请求领导上加以修订。装配车间许多小组也主动对各种产品的工时定额作了审查，建议领导上迅速订出合理的新定额。如第五小组提出将装配圆筒混合机的工时定额由一百二十五小时压缩为八十小时。第六小组提出将装配煤气发生炉的工时定额缩短20％。金工二车间操纵大型镗床的工人，提出把加工减速器的定额工时由十二小时减少到八小时。
    这个厂最近又出现了一种新气象，就是许多职工主动撤回了要宿舍的申请。前一个时期，该厂共有七百三十四名职工申请家属宿舍。近来，经过社会主义教育，职工们认识到勤俭建国、勤俭办企业以及服从整体利益的意义，已有二百九十三名要家属宿舍的职工主动撤消了他们的申请。
    此外，还有不少工人缴回了他们多余的工作服。仅八车间、四车间就有六十多名工人缴回了新领的工作服，他们认为旧的还可以洗洗补补穿，不必领新的了。
