A Wonderful Volleyball Match Last Night
　　Beijing Team Defeats Tirana Team Three to Two
　　This newspaper reports: Last night, the Albanian Tirana men's volleyball team held a friendly match with the Beijing Youth Team at the Beijing Gymnasium. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the home team defeated the Tirana team three to two.

　　The guest team did not display their strength in the first set. They lost the opportunity to organize attacks due to inaccurate passing during their offense. Although almost all the players on the Beijing Youth Team were novices, they played excellently. He Li's diagonal smash and Chen Wenzhi's quick hits scored points continuously, winning the first set with a score of 15 to 9.

　　After being frustrated in the first round, the guest team played cautiously in the second set. They took a 3-1 lead right from the start with quick spikes and cannonball-like serves. The home team made many mistakes such as touching the net and spiking out of bounds, allowing the guest team to win a set with a score of 15 to 6.

　　In the third set, the difference between the scores of both sides was always between two and three points. The score finally tied at 14 all. At this moment, the home team lost due to impatience and tension, with two spikes going out of bounds and being blocked, losing with a score of 14 to 16.

　　In the fourth set, the Beijing team used offensive tactics very flexibly, taking an 11-5 lead in no time. After a timeout, the guest team strengthened their blocking, and the back row firmly defended their positions, with Mrzaku making powerful hook shots from the right corner, bringing the score to 14 all and 15 all. But the Beijing team finally took advantage of the guest team's last two mistakes to win with a score of 17 to 15.

　　In the final set that determined the victory, the Beijing team played calmly and cautiously, making few mistakes. After several fierce spikes from the guest team were blocked, they became more impatient, making more mistakes, and finally lost with a score of 15 to 7.

　　Today, Vice Premier of the State Council He Long and Li Fuchun watched the game. (Guo An)

　　昨晚一场精采排球赛
　　北京队以三比二胜地拉那队
    本报讯　昨晚，阿尔巴尼亚地拉那男子排球队在北京体育馆同北京青年队举行了一场友谊比赛。经过约两小时的苦战，主队以三比二胜地拉那队。
    客队在第一局比赛中，没有发挥出他们的力量。他们在进攻时，由于传球不准，失却了组织进攻的机会。北京青年队虽然上场的几乎全是新手，但打得很出色，何力的斜线劈杀和陈文智的快板球接连得分，以十五比九胜了第一局。
    客队在第一回合受挫后，第二局打得小心谨慎。一上场便以快扣和炮弹式的发球，以三比一领先。主队碰网、扣球出界等失误多，被客队以十五比六胜了一局。
    第三局比赛中，双方比分的相差始终在两、三分之间。最后打成十四平。这时主队因急躁和紧张，两次扣球出界和被拦回，以十四比十六败北。
    第四局比赛中，北京队进攻的战术运用得很灵活，不一会便以十一比五领先。客队暂停后，加强了拦网，后排固守阵地，以姆尔扎库在右角作钩手的大力扣杀，追成了十四平、十五平。但北京队终于乘客队最后两次失误，以十七比十五取胜。
    在决定胜负的最后一局中，北京队打得冷静谨慎，很少失误。客队在几次猛扣被拦回后，打得较为急躁，失误多，最后以十五比七败北。
    今天，国务院副总理贺龙、李富春观看了这场球赛。　（国安）
