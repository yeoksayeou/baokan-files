Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 10th: China's first "heart-lung machine," which uses a machine to replace the human heart and lungs, has been successfully trial-manufactured by the state-owned Shanghai Medical Equipment Factory. The Shanghai Chest Hospital, which is about to open, used this machine on a dog yesterday for an extracorporeal blood circulation experiment.

The application of the "heart-lung machine" enables the blood of humans or animals to bypass the heart and lungs and temporarily circulate outside the body, thereby allowing for surgical operations on the resting heart. This has been a key focus of international medical research in recent years.

This machine, mainly made of plastic, replaced the heart and lungs of a dog for a full twenty minutes in the experiment on the 9th (generally, the heart stopping for five minutes will result in death). Because the machine normally oxygenated the dog's venous blood into arterial blood and returned it to the dog's body, it maintained its life.

　　人工心肺机
    据新华社上海10日电　中国第一架用机器代替人体心脏和肺的“人工心肺机”，已由国营上海医疗器械厂试制成功。即将开幕的上海市胸科医院昨天用这架机器在狗身上作了一次体外血液循环试验。
    应用“人工心肺机”使人或动物的血液不经过心脏和肺，暂时在体外循环，从而在休止的心脏上进行外科手术，这是近年来国际上医学研究的一个重点。
    这架主要用塑胶制成的机器，在9日的实验中曾代替狗的心脏和肺足足有二十分钟（一般心脏休止五分钟，就会死亡）。由于机器正常地把狗的静脉血氧化成为动脉血，重新流回到狗的身体去，因此维持了它的生命。
