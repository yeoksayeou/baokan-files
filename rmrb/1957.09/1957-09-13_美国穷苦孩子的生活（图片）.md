The Lives of Poor Children in America

　　In the black neighborhoods of New York, living conditions are very harsh, and rats often come out at night to bite babies (right picture). A black child's arm has been bitten several times by rats.

　　Many children from poor families in the United States have to sell their labor to make a living. (Bottom picture) This poor child is struggling to dump cotton on a truck. How disproportionate his work is to his age!

　　美国穷苦孩子的生活
    在纽约的黑人区，生活条件非常恶劣，老鼠常常在晚上出来咬婴孩（右图），一个黑人儿童的手臂被老鼠咬了几个洞。
    美国许多穷苦人家的孩子不得不出卖劳力来维持生活。（下图），这个穷孩子正在吃力地在货车上倒棉花，看他的工作和他的年龄是多么不相称啊！
