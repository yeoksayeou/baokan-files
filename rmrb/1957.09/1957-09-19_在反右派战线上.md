　　On the Anti-Rightist Front
　　Wang Gang Proposed Arrogant Idea to Establish More Anti-Party Newspapers
　　Wang Gang, the rightist element who was the Chief Editor Office Director of the Sichuan Workers’ Daily, openly and systematically attacked the Communist Party's newspaper management line both inside and outside the newspaper office in the first half of this year. He arrogantly demanded the cancellation of the provincial and municipal Party committee's newspapers and advocated for the establishment of more "mass newspapers" that were not subject to the leadership or supervision of specific organizations and could freely criticize the Party committees. Under Wang Gang's manipulation and influence, this newspaper published a large amount of sensational news about obscene and murder cases, such as the "Child Corpse Case" and "Her Death," in prominent locations and in extra-large headlines in May and June. It also specifically opened two major columns, "Fang Fang's Mailbox" and "Little Zhuge Service Desk," which often published things like "hermaphrodites," "the distress of being lovelorn," "what to do when someone falls in love with two sisters," and other low-level, vulgar content related to eating, drinking, and having fun. This newspaper also had a "Satire" column, which specialized in publishing essays and cartoons that uglified Communist Party members and the new society.
　　
    Vehemently Slandering the Agricultural Cooperativization System
　　Zhang Qingheng is a Spokesperson for the Bourgeoisie Within the Party
　　The rightist element within the Party, Zhang Qingheng (former Deputy Director of the State-Owned Farm Management Office of the Rural Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC), vehemently slandered the Party's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the agricultural cooperativization system, and openly advocated for taking the capitalist road.
    He slandered the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, saying: "The state's implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain has put the peasants in a dead end. If this problem is not resolved, the peasants will cause trouble, and everyone will participate when trouble arises, and the world will be in chaos." He also said: The realization of cooperativization has dug up his old roots, "Even if you have money in the future, you can't buy land, who will actively produce!" Therefore, he frantically slandered and attacked the agricultural cooperativization system, saying: "All problems in rural areas are caused by cooperativization."
　　Currently, the cadres of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC are continuing to deeply expose and refute Zhang Qingheng's criminal words and actions.
　　
    Attacking the Party's Leadership and Electoral System
    Ma Yunfeng Degenerated into a Traitor to the Party
    Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics exposed the Party's traitor, student Ma Yunfeng.
    After the Hungarian incident, he wrote reactionary slogans on the roads, classrooms, and toilets in the school. After the rectification campaign began, he posted big-character posters such as "Organizational methods are outdated" and "Several humble opinions," which concentrated on attacking the Party's leading position in the country. He also attacked our country's electoral system, saying that "citizens' electoral rights are unequal," and called for "free elections," even "bad elements can run for election." He openly advocated for "implementing a capitalist political system" in our country.

　　在反右派战线上
　　汪岗提出狂妄主张要多办反党的报纸
    四川工人日报总编室主任右派分子汪岗，在今年上半年，先后在报社内外，公开地系统地攻击共产党的办报路线。他狂妄地要求取消省市党委的机关报，主张多办不受一定的机关领导、监督，可以随便批评党委的“群众报”。这家报纸在汪岗的操纵和影响下，5、6月份以大量的显著的篇幅，用特大字号标题，连续登载了“童尸案”、“她的死”等耸人听闻的色情、谋杀案件的新闻；还专门开辟了“方方信箱”、“小诸葛服务台”两大栏，经常登载一些“阴阳人”、“失恋的苦闷”、“一个人爱上了两姊妹怎么办”以及讲究吃、喝、闹、玩等低级趣味的东西。这张报纸还辟了一个“讽刺”专栏，专登丑化共产党员和新社会的杂文、漫画。
    极力诋毁农业合作化制度
　　张庆恒是党内资产阶级代言人
    党内右派分子张庆恒（原中共河南省委农村工作部国营农场管理处副处长），极力诋毁党的统购统销政策和农业合作化制度，并公开主张走资本主义道路。
    他污蔑统购统销政策说：“国家实行粮食统购统销把农民弄的死死的，这个问题不解决，农民要闹事，闹起事来人人都会参加，天下就要大乱。”他还说：实现合作化是挖了他的老根，“今后有钱也不能买地，谁还积极生产哩！”因而他疯狂地污蔑和攻击农业合作化制度说：“农村一切问题都是由于合作化带来的”。
    现在，中共河南省委机关干部正继续深入揭露和驳斥张庆恒的罪恶言行。
    攻击党的领导和选举制度
    马云风堕落成党的叛徒
    北京航空学院揭露了党的叛徒、学生马云风。
    在匈牙利事件发生后，他就在学校里的马路上、教室里、厕所内写反动标语。整风开始后，他张贴了“组织手段过时了”和“几条拙见”的大字报，集中攻击党在国家中的领导地位。他还攻击我国的选举制度说，“公民选举权不平等”，要“自由竞选”，甚至“坏分子也可以竞选”。他公开主张在我国“实行资本主义的政治制度”。
