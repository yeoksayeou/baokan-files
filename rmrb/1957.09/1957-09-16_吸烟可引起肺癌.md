    Smoking Can Cause Lung Cancer

    According to research by British scientists, the carcinogens in tobacco leaves are currently believed to be five types of hydrocarbons, one of which is benzpyrene.

    Some British scientists injected carcinogens extracted from tobacco leaves into the lungs of thirty-two mice. As a result, twenty-three of them died after about two hundred and fifty days. They also injected tar from cigarette filters used by smokers into eight mice, and two mice died as a result.

    According to a recent report at the British Cancer Prevention Association's annual meeting in London, the production of carcinogens in tobacco leaves is related to the drying and ignition methods of the tobacco leaves.

    Tobacco itself does not cause lung cancer, but baking tobacco leaves with coal or liquid fuel can produce benzpyrene. In Southern Rhodesia, Africa, some people use sunlight to dry fresh tobacco leaves and have found that the tobacco leaves do not contain benzpyrene. It is worth noting that tobacco leaves that have had carcinogens removed will produce carcinogens again when burned.

    According to research, paper-rolled cigarettes produce the most carcinogens, followed by cigars; smoking with a pipe produces the least carcinogens.

    If fish or meat is smoked with smoke, it may also be contaminated with carcinogens.

    吸烟可引起肺癌
    根据英国科学家们研究，烟叶中的致癌物，目前认为是五种碳氢化物。其中的一种是苯嵌二萘。
    一些英国科学家曾经将烟叶中提出的致癌物注射在三十二只老鼠的肺内。结果，其中二十三只约于二百五十天后死去。又将人们吸烟用的滤咀中的焦油注射到八只老鼠体内，结果二只老鼠死亡。
    据最近在伦敦举行的英国防癌协会年会报道，烟叶之所以会产生致癌物，同烟叶的干燥、燃点方式有关。
    烟草本身并不会引起肺癌，但用煤火或液体燃料来烘焙烟叶可产生苯嵌二萘。非洲南罗德西亚地区有人利用日光晒干新鲜烟叶，发现烟叶中并没有苯嵌二萘。值得注意的是，已经除去致癌物的烟叶，燃烧时会再度产生致癌物。
    据研究，纸卷香烟产生致癌物最多；雪茄烟次之；用烟斗吸烟，产生致癌物最少。
    如果用烟来熏鱼、肉，也可能沾染致癌物。
