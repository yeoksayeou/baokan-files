An Unprecedented Democratic Movement
——A Record of the Big-Character Posters at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
By our reporter Gu Lei

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant began its great blooming and contending on August 23rd. The plant's Party organization called on workers to use big-character posters to expose shortcomings in all aspects of the enterprise, and expressed its determination to resolutely correct these shortcomings. The workers responded, "The rectification campaign is for better building socialism. We must act like the leading class, say what we have to say, and help the Party correct shortcomings and errors in its work!" The next day, 373 big-character posters appeared throughout the plant. By the 27th, the number of newly posted big-character posters exceeded 510. Many workers on the night shift, after getting off work and sleeping for less than five hours, jumped out of bed and rushed back to the factory to write their opinions on big-character posters. Those who could write were busy getting pens, ink, and paper, while those who couldn't write quickly found someone to write for them. Everyone worked hard to recall every opinion and write it down on paper, and then personally post it. By September 23rd, the entire plant had posted 8,114 big-character posters, and all the places where big-character posters were posted had been changed several times! The big-character posters shook everyone. Some wrote, some read, some discussed, some examined shortcomings in their work, some studied plans for improvement, some exchanged opinions... With the appearance of big-character posters, various aspects of life in the factory became more active than ever before.

When the great blooming and contending began, some people in the plant suspected: would the workers only talk about welfare issues? Would they be uncalm when criticizing leaders? Now it seems that these worries were unnecessary. The vast majority of workers used the weapon of big-character posters with the correct attitude. I have read one or two thousand big-character posters, and I have also interviewed some comrades who were criticized. These big-character posters and the conversations with these comrades all show that the criticisms raised by the workers were mostly correct, the emotions were normal, the attitudes were positive, and they came from the desire to improve production. According to the statistics of September 22nd, the big-character posters raised a total of 7,952 opinions, including 2,628 related to production, 1,643 related to cadre style, 220 related to cultural learning and cultural life, 471 related to Party-masses work, 1,004 related to wages and rewards, 928 related to welfare, 142 related to political issues, and 916 others. It is not difficult to see what our workers mainly think about! The big-character posters rarely contain sarcastic, mocking, abusive, or personal attacks; what can be seen are mostly realistic, straightforward, simple, and full of comradely feelings criticisms or suggestions. The following big-character poster questioning the factory director can be taken as an example:

"In the coking workshop, in the down-draft furnaces of rows one and two, on June 19th and 20th of this year, substandard products were produced for two consecutive days because the ash content of the coke was 14.2% and 14.4% respectively, amounting to 68.878 tons. However, at the request of the coking workshop, the factory director approved reporting the production as qualified. May we ask what is the basis for the factory director's decision? Reporting substandard products as qualified for no reason, then what is the use of the coke quality standards issued by the factory? We hope that the factory director will also act according to the rules in the future. Supervisory Station"

Of course, some big-character posters have relatively strong wording, but this can only give people a feeling of disappointment and make people feel that this kind of criticism is reasonable and does not show any malice. One big-character poster entitled "Two Scattered Poems Presented to Foreman Zhang" wrote:

"Foreman Zhang has a strong personality, he really knows how to lead the workers, after the workers have an accident, he scolds them enough to make them lose face;
The young men are so angry that they want to explode, the patient veteran workers shed tears silently,
People live for face, trees live for bark, may I ask whose heart is willing?
Wang Bin"

The workers also put forward many suggestions, many of which are feasible and reasonable. These well-intentioned criticisms and pertinent suggestions firmly demonstrate the workers' socialist stand and aspirations. All this moved every leader. According to the spirit of rectifying while correcting, they busily copied down the criticisms of themselves from the big-character posters, looked for suggestions for the work of their departments, or used big-character posters to express their gratitude to the critics, or found the critics to conduct self-criticism in person, or formulated plans and programs for improving work. A mass upsurge of improving work was formed throughout the plant. Problems were laid out, some problems were solved, and everyone, from top to bottom, felt happy. Chu Deyi, deputy director of the Transportation Department, said with emotion: "This time it's different from the past. In the past movements, the masses were asked to do more, and the leadership only deployed work downwards, habitually issuing orders. Now the masses are asking the leadership to improve their work and change their style from the bottom up. The power of big-character posters is very great." This is people's evaluation of big-character posters.

In fact, big-character posters have a huge promoting effect on improving production work. In a short period of time, thousands of people publicly exposed the shortcomings of production work through big-character posters, which has never happened before. The power of big-character posters extends to every corner, involving all aspects of work, from departments to workshops, from planning to quotas, from output to quality, from equipment utilization to cost work, from safety to labor conditions, from organizational structure to system, all-encompassing. This is a major exposure of the shortcomings of production work, and also a major cleaning. Because the plant has implemented the policy of rectifying while correcting, and because of the supervision of the masses, most of the problems raised by the big-character posters have been solved or are being solved, many of which are old problems that have not been solved for several years. This is a major force for promoting various production reforms and comprehensively improving production, because every time some problems are solved, production has new changes. For example, some foremen in the first iron-smelting furnace did not insist on implementing the system of checking the stock rod once a week. After the big-character posters criticized this matter, furnace leader Wang Cai went to check this matter and found that the stock rod and the indicated data differed by 370 millimeters. After correction, 43 tons of pig iron were overproduced the next day. For example, the large and bloated management organization is one of the most prominent problems in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and it is also a central point of criticism in the big-character posters. Now a plan has been studied to streamline the organization, merging 31 sections into 20, and merging 17 workshops, divisions, and teams into 10, reducing the number of management personnel from 1,975 to 896, a reduction of more than half. With the implementation of this plan, the management organization of this plant will be lean and efficient.

Some bureaucratic styles in the enterprise have never been fatally hit in many past movements, but this time they were overthrown by big-character posters! Not long after the big-character posters started, 238 cadres were named. Those phenomena such as not going deep into the workshop, not caring about workers' ideological education, having a rude attitude towards workers, not understanding workers' work and life hardships, having a special life, not abiding by the system, being irresponsible in work, and having a procrastinating style, were posted on hundreds of big-character posters and subjected to public criticism. Many of these phenomena have existed for a long time; they have been preserved because there was no such large-scale public criticism in the past. The practice of publicly criticizing cadres' style like this time is unprecedented. At the beginning, the cadres felt very pressured, especially the comrades who were criticized by dozens of big-character posters at the same time, and their mood was very heavy. At this time, the Party organization encouraged them to bravely accept criticism and bravely correct their mistakes. Not long after the big-character posters raised criticisms, the leading cadres of the plant and workshops established a system of going to the workshops for twelve hours every two weeks and participating in physical labor once every two weeks. As a result of going deep into the workshops and going deep among the workers, many problems were discovered and solved. When Cui Xiaoqing, director of the Ironmaking Department, participated in physical labor, he personally felt that the iron car was not running smoothly, which was very harmful to the work and the health of the workers, so he immediately organized forces to repair it. If it had been in the past, I don't know how long it would have taken to deal with this matter. All the comrades who were criticized by the big-character posters held symposiums with the people who made suggestions, made self-criticism in person, expressed their determination to correct their shortcomings, and explained some misunderstandings. This is rectification, this is the ideological transformation of cadres. Since then, the leaders have solved problems in a timely manner, understood the situation below clearly, had a close relationship with the workers, and the democratic life in the plant has become more active. The workers generally said that the leading cadres have changed a lot, and the leading cadres said that the workers are easier to lead than in the past. This kind of atmosphere has not been seen in the past.

While the workers exposed various shortcomings and put forward their own suggestions on big-character posters, they also expressed their opinions on certain issues. In this way, a small number of workers naturally exposed some unhealthy thoughts. These incorrect views could not naturally cause the agreement of the majority of people, and someone would put forward opposite opinions, and disputes would occur. In recent days, the workers' debates on issues such as welfare, wages and rewards, and labor protection have spontaneously unfolded on big-character posters. The debates are mostly caused by specific issues. For example, some workers in the plant live in the factory's dormitories, and the rent is very low, which is completely inconsistent with the principle of "using rent to support the houses," while other workers rent farmers' houses in the countryside, and the factory gives them housing subsidies, which costs more than 200,000 yuan per year. Someone put forward on a big-character poster that the rent for living in the factory's dormitories should be charged according to the city's rent standards, and at the same time, the housing subsidies should be cancelled, so that the state could save more than 500,000 yuan per year. After this suggestion was put forward, some workers expressed their approval, on the grounds that the state should not take care of all the workers' welfare, which is not in line with the spirit of building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and asked the leaders to do this immediately. Some workers also opposed this suggestion, on the grounds that doing so would reduce the workers' living standards, and believed that the state should continuously improve the workers' lives, and should not reduce them. If the rent is to be increased or the housing subsidies are to be cancelled, it should be discussed after the wages are increased, otherwise it is not thinking about the workers, and it is a capitalist practice. And some people said that the person who made the suggestion "must be from a capitalist family." The essence of this debate is whether all the welfare of the workers should be taken care of by the state. Other issues such as wages, rewards, and labor protection are also debated. The significance of this debate is significant. The leadership can summarize the problems exposed on the big-character posters, according to the factory's situation, into several or dozens of problems and hand them over to the workers for debate. Because big-character posters are a forum that workers like very much, conducting debates on them can attract more people to participate, and it will become the most vivid and effective form of workers distinguishing right from wrong and conducting self-education, and the workers will improve their class consciousness in the great debate.

Mobilizing the masses to carry out great blooming and contending, and using criticism and self-criticism to resolve contradictions among the people, is unprecedented, and it is a brand-new and extremely important page in the history of the Chinese workers' movement. The big-character posters in enterprises during this period are vivid and historically significant documents. From the situation of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, it can be seen that big-character posters have great power in resolving various contradictions, which is not only a form, but a profound practice of the mass line. Through mass criticism, mass improvement, mass debate and self-education, the policy of building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily can be smoothly implemented on this basis, which is a movement of great political and economic significance. Now, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has copied down the big-character posters and compiled them into a collection as a permanent memorial, and at the same time mobilized the workers to continue posting them, continue to improve all aspects of work, and start organizing great debates. A leading comrade in the plant told me: "If big-character posters can be regularized, they will always put the various tasks of the enterprise under the supervision of the masses, so as to avoid the accumulation of problems, avoid cadres from being divorced from the masses, avoid the development of erroneous thoughts, and also ensure that democratic life is always active."

    史无前例的民主运动
    ——记石景山钢铁厂的大字报
    本报记者　顾雷
    石景山钢铁厂从8月23日开始大鸣大放。工厂的党组织号召工人用大字报揭发企业各方面的缺点，并且表示了狠狠改正缺点的决心。工人们回答说：“整风是为了更好地建设社会主义，我们一定拿出领导阶级的样子来，有什么说什么，帮助党改正工作中的缺点和错误！”第二天，全厂出现了三百七十三张大字报，到了27日，新贴出的大字报突破五百一十张。许多上夜班的工人，下了班睡不到五个小时，便跳下床来跑回工厂，为的是把自己的意见写在大字报上。会写字的人，忙着领笔、墨、纸，不会写字的人赶快找人代笔。大家努力回忆，要把每一点意见写到纸上，亲手贴出去。到9月23日，全厂已贴出大字报八千一百一十四张，所有贴大字报的地方已几易新旧了！大字报震动了每一个人，有的写、有的看、有的议论、有的检查工作中的缺点、有的研究改进工作的方案、有的互相交换意见……。工厂里的各种生活，随着大字报的出现，比往日活跃了。
    大鸣大放开始的时候，厂内曾有人这样怀疑：工人会不会只谈生活福利问题呢？会不会在批评领导的时候表现得不冷静呢？现在看来，这些耽心都是多余的。绝大多数的工人都是用正确的态度使用大字报这一武器。我阅读过一两千张大字报，也访问过一些被批评的同志。这些大字报和这些同志的谈话，都说明工人提出的批评绝大部分是正确的，情绪是正常的，态度是积极的，是从提高生产的愿望出发的。根据9月22日的统计，大字报共提出意见七千九百五十二条，其中属于生产的二千六百二十八条、干部作风的一千六百四十三条、文化学习和文化生活的二百二十条、党群工作的四百七十一条、工资奖励的一千零四条、生活福利的九百二十八条、政治问题的一百四十二条、其他九百一十六条。不难看出，我们的工人主要想的是什么了！大字报上，很少有挖苦、嘲笑、谩骂或进行人身攻击的词句；所能看到的，大都是实事求是、开门见山、语意淳朴、充满同志感情的批评或建议。下面这张质问厂长的大字报，可以作为一个例子：
    “炼焦车间倒焰炉一—二排，今年6月19日至20日，连续两天因为焦 炭灰分分别为14.2％和14.4％，造成六十八点八七八吨不合格品。但在炼焦车间要求下，厂长批准了按合格品报产。请问厂长的决定根据是什么？无故把不合格品报产，那末厂颁发焦炭质量标准有什么用呢？我们希望厂长今后也要按制度办事。　监督站”
    当然，也有些大字报的措词比较激烈，但这只能给人以恨铁不成钢的感觉，使人觉得这种批评是合乎情理的，看不出有什么恶意。有一张题为“赠张工长散诗两首”的大字报写道：
    “张工长的个性强，领导工人真有方，工人出了事故后，没鼻子没脸数个够；
    气得小伙子要炸肺，能忍的老师傅暗流泪，
    人活脸，树活皮，请问谁人心愿意？
                      王彬”
    工人们同时提出了不少的建议，许多建议都是可行的、合理的。这些善意的批评、中肯的建议，坚定地表明了工人的社会主义立场和愿望。这一切，令每一个领导人员感动。他们根据边整边改的精神，忙着从大字报上抄下对自己的批评，找寻对本部门工作的建议，或用大字报表示对批评者的感谢，或找到批评者当面进行检讨，或拟定改进工作的方案和计划。全厂形成了群众性的改进工作的热潮。问题摆开了，有些问题解决了，上上下下都觉得心里头痛快。运输部副主任褚德义感动地说：“这回和过去不同了。过去搞运动，叫群众做的多，领导上只是向下布置工作，习惯于发号施令。现在是群众自下而上要求领导改进工作，改变作风，大字报这股子力量是很大的。”这就是人们对大字报的估价。
    实际上大字报对改进生产工作是有巨大推动作用的。在一个短短的时间内，成千上万的人通过大字报公开揭露生产工作的缺点，确是过去没有过的事。大字报的威力伸展到每一个角落，涉及到各方面的工作，从科室到车间、从计划到定额、从产量到质量、从设备利用到成本工作、从安全到劳动条件、从组织机构到制度，无所不包。这是生产工作缺点的大暴露，也是一次大扫除。由于全厂贯彻了边整边改的方针，由于群众的督促，大字报提出的问题，大部分都得到解决或正在解决，其中有许多是好几年没有解决的老问题。这是促进各种生产改革、全面提高生产的重大力量，因为每解决一些问题，生产就有新的变化。例如，第一炼铁炉有的工长不坚持执行一周检查一次料尺的制度，大字报对这件事提出批评以后，炉长王才去检查这件事，发现料尺与指示数据相差三百七十公厘，经过校正，第二天就超产生铁四十三吨。又如，管理机构庞大、臃肿，是石景山钢铁厂最突出的问题之一，也是大字报批评的一个中心。现在已研究出精简机构的方案，要把三十一个科室合并为二十个，把十七个车间和股、队合并为十个，管理人员由一千九百七十五个减至八百九十六个，减少一半以上。实现这个方案，这个厂的管理机构就将是精干的、效率高的了。
    企业中的一些官僚主义作风，在过去许多运动中，从来没有受到过致命的打击，这次却被大字报搬倒了！大字报开始不几天，有二百三十八名干部被点了名。那些不深入车间、不关心工人思想教育、对工人态度粗暴、不了解工人工作和生活的疾苦、生活特殊、不遵守制度、工作不负责任、作风拖拉等现象，被登在几百张大字报上，受到舆论的责备，其中有许多现象是早已存在的；由于过去没有这种声势浩大的公开的批评，以致保留了下来。像这次这样公开批评干部作风的做法是过去没有的。一开始干部觉得压力非常大，特别是同时受到几十张大字报批评的同志，心情很沉重。这时，党组织鼓励他们勇敢接受批评，勇敢改正错误。大字报提出批评不久，厂和车间的领导干部建立了每两周十二小时下车间、每两周参加一次体力劳动的制度。深入车间、深入工人的结果，发现和解决了许多问题。炼铁部主任崔孝庆参加体力劳动的时候，亲身感到铁车运转不灵，对工作、对工人健康有很大损害，立即组织力量修好了。要是在过去，这件事不知要拖多长时间才能处理呢。凡是受到大字报批评的同志，都找提意见的人开座谈会，当面检讨，表示改正缺点的决心，解释某些误会。这就是整风，这就是干部的思想改造。从此，领导人员解决问题及时了解，对下边的情况清楚了，同工人的关系亲密了，而厂内的民主生活也更加活跃了。工人普遍说领导干部大大变了样子，领导干部则说工人比过去好领导了。这种气象，是过去见不到的。
    工人们一方面在大字报上揭发各种缺点，提出自己的建议，另一方面也表明自己对某些问题的意见。这样，有少数工人也很自然地暴露出一些不健康的思想。这些不正确的观点当然不可能引起多数人的同意，会有人提出相反的意见，会发生争论的。这些天来，工人们在生活福利、工资奖励、劳动保护等问题上的争论，已经自发地在大字报上展开了。争论大都是从具体问题上引起的。例如，全厂有一部分工人住厂里的宿舍，房租非常低，完全不符合“以租养房”的原则，另一部分工人在乡下租农民的房子住，厂里发给房贴，每年一共要支出二十余万元。有人在大字报上提出住厂内宿舍应按市内房租标准收费，同时取消房贴，这样每年就可以给国家省出五十多万元。这个建议提出以后，一部分工人表示赞成，理由是国家不应把工人一切生活福利全包下来，这是不符合勤俭建国、勤俭办企业精神的，要求领导上马上办这件事。也有一部分工人反对这个建议，理由是这样做会降低工人生活水平，认为国家应该不断地改善工人生活，而不应当降低。如果要提高房租或取消房贴，等增加了工资以后再说，否则就是不替工人着想，就是资本主义的做法。而且有人说提建议的人“一定是资本家出身”。这一争论的实质是工人所有的生活福利，是不是应该由国家全部包下来。其他如工资、奖励、劳保等问题，也有争论。这种争论的意义是重大的。领导上可以通过大字报上暴露出的问题，根据本厂情况，归纳成几个或几十个问题交给工人去辩论。由于大字报是工人十分喜欢的讲坛，在这上面进行辩论能吸收更多的人参加，就会成为工人辨明是非、进行自我教育的最生动和最有效的一种形式，工人们将会在大辩论中提高阶级觉悟。
    发动群众大鸣大放，用批评和自我批评的方式解决人民内部矛盾，这是史无前例的，是中国工人运动史上崭新的、极其重要的一页。这一时期企业里的大字报，就是活生生的有历史意义的文献。从石景山钢铁厂的情况，就可以看出大字报在解决各种矛盾时具有极大的威力，这不单是一种形式，而是深刻的走群众路线的实践。通过群众性的批评，群众性的改进、群众性的辩论和自我教育，就可以在这个基础上顺利贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，这是一次具有重大政治经济意义的运动。现在，石景山钢铁厂已经把大字报抄下来汇编成集，作为永远的纪念，同时发动工人继续贴下去，继续改进各方面的工作，并着手组织大辩论。厂里的一位领导同志告诉我说：“大字报如果能经常化，会时刻把企业各种工作放在群众监督之下，免得问题成堆，免得干部脱离群众，免得错误思想发展，还可以保证民主生活永远是活跃的。”
