To Friends and Colleagues in the Scientific Community:

This year marks the 36th anniversary of the independence of the Mongolian people, the first among the oppressed peoples of the Far East to complete a people's revolution and liberate themselves from the oppression of colonialism and feudalism.

The history of the Mongolian People's Republic is a history of the freedom-loving Mongolian people's struggle to establish and consolidate their national independence and for continuous development in the economic and cultural fields, and a history of struggle for peace, friendship, and cooperation among all countries of the world.

During the days of World War II, the Mongolian people sympathized deeply with the people struggling for peace and freedom, for the culture and happiness of mankind, and against Hitlerism. During the war, every working person in the Mongolian People's Republic did their best to provide material support for the victory over Nazism. After the war, the Mongolian people warmly supported the establishment of the United Nations Organization. The lofty goals of this organization won the heartfelt endorsement of all strata of residents of the Mongolian People's Republic.

Every patriotic person in Mongolia believes that our people's contribution to the cause of freedom, independence, and peace entitles the peace-loving Mongolian People's Republic to become a member of the United Nations. Since its founding, the Mongolian People's Republic has consistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship among all countries, in line with the highest principles declared by the United Nations.

The friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, and other people's democracies has enabled the Mongolian people to achieve even greater new successes in developing the national economy and culture in the post-war years.

In the Mongolian People's Republic, the illiteracy inherited from the past has been eliminated, and experts and cadres of our own nationality have been trained. Our people are proud of the valuable achievements gained through our great efforts and proud of the traditions of our ancient culture, which have now become the wealth of the whole people.

Throughout the historical development of our country, our people have always attached great importance to science and are convinced that science should serve humanity, progress, happiness, and the friendship of all peoples. Now, as a scientist and a son of our people, I appeal to all Oriental scholars and experts on Mongolian issues in all countries who respect and cherish contributions to the treasure house of human culture. I earnestly request that you support the legitimate aspirations of the Mongolian people in the spirit of humanitarianism, enabling this independent, peace-loving people's country to become a member of the United Nations.

    致各国东方学者和蒙古问题专家
    科学界的朋友和同行们：
    远东被压迫人民中最先完成人民革命、从殖民制度和封建制度压迫下获得解放的蒙古人民，今年庆祝了自己国家独立的三十六周年。
    蒙古人民共和国的历史是爱好自由的蒙古人民为建立和巩固自己国家的独立和为在经济、文化方面的不断发展而斗争的历史，是为了争取和平、友谊和全世界各国之间的合作而斗争的历史。
    在第二次世界大战的日子里，蒙古人民非常同情为争取和平与自由、争取人类的文化和幸福以及反对希特勒主义而斗争的人民。在战争时期，蒙古人民共和国的每一个劳动人民为了战胜纳粹主义都尽力提供了物质支援。战后，蒙古人民热烈地拥护建立联合国组织。这个组织的崇高目的博得了蒙古人民共和国各阶层居民的衷心赞同。
    蒙古每一个爱国人士都认为：我国人民为自由、独立与和平事业的贡献使爱好和平的蒙古人民共和国有权成为联合国的会员国。蒙古人民共和国自建国以来一贯奉行着符合联合国宣布的最高原则的和平和世界各国人民之间友好的政策。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克以及其他人民民主国家的友好援助，使蒙古人民在战后年代，在发展国民经济和文化方面取得了更加巨大的新成就。
    在蒙古人民共和国，过去遗留下来的文盲已经扫除了，同时也培养了自己本民族的专家和干部。我国人民为我们的巨大努力所获得的宝贵成就而自豪，为今天已成为全民财富的古老文化的传统而自豪。
    在我国历史发展的整个时期内，我国人民总是极其重视科学的，并且确信科学应当为人类、进步、幸福和各国人民的友谊而服务。现在，我作为一个科学家和我国人民的儿子，向所有尊重和珍视对人类文化的宝库有所贡献的东方各国的东方学者和蒙古问题专家们呼吁，我热烈地要求你们以人道主义的精神支持蒙古人民实现自己的正当愿望，使这个独立的、爱好和平的人民的国家成为联合国的会员国。
