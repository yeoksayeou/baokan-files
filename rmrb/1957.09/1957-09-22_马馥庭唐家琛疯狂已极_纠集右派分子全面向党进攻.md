A series of counter-rightist struggle meetings were held at Lanzhou Medical College to expose the anti-Party group led by Ma Futing, professor of pathology, and Tang Jiachen, professor of neurology. This group was formed in 1952, and its core members included Liu Shangzhe, Mao Jingwei, Chen Guanghua, and Wei Bin. Among the members of this anti-Party group, over 80% were either from families of reactionary classes, had participated in counter-revolutionary organizations, had relatives who were struggled against, detained, or sentenced, or had been targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign. For example, Ma Futing was the leader of the Youth Party in Gansu Province, Tang Jiachen was a reactionary senior military officer, Liu Fengju was a traitor, and Yu Kui was one of the main responsible persons of the counter-revolutionary organization "Justice Society." During the period of great contending and blooming, this anti-Party group, as its core, gathered all the large and small anti-Party groups in the college to form an anti-Party grand alliance and launched a full-scale offensive against the Party.

According to exposures and materials admitted by the rightist elements, it is proven that this group of rightist elements attacked the Party from the following aspects:

First, opposing the leadership of the Party. Ma Futing openly proposed the principle of running a university: "I think it is relying on experts, that is, professors and teaching staff." Tang Jiachen promoted: "Many universities before liberation were well-run without Party committees." He also said: "The United States does not have a Party committee system, and the universities are also well-run."

Second, opposing the socialist system. Tang Jiachen said: "I used to think that Lanzhou, the Northwest, and Lanzhou Medical College were backward, but now it seems to be a national problem, so I wonder if it is a problem with the system." When rightist elements across the country attacked the socialist system, he said: "Great minds think alike, all crows under the sky are black." These rightist elements also said that "people are not equal under the socialist system."

Third, opposing Marxism-Leninism. They openly demanded to the school: "Streamline Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary history courses." Some of them tore up Marxism-Leninism exam papers after the exam and specifically wrote articles in their diaries with the title "Burning Marxism-Leninism."

Fourth, opposing the Party's various policies. The rightist elements were extremely hostile to every movement and policy of the Party. Ma Futing said that the ideological remolding movement was "sophistry and nitpicking." Tang Jiachen said that ideological remolding was "chilling, heartbreaking, disheartening, and worrying!" Liu Shangzhe slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as "extorting confessions by torture." Ma Futing shouted: "I agree with Luo Longji's proposal for a rehabilitation committee."

Fifth, provoking the relationship between the Party and the democratic parties. They said that the "gully" and "wall" were created by the Communist Party. He also maliciously slandered: "This wall is like the Great Wall, the Party committee should take the lead in demolishing it, don't let people cry down the Great Wall like Meng Jiangnu." Tang Jiachen distorted the content of mutual supervision and said: "The democratic parties welcome the Party to supervise them, and provide such conditions, such as inviting the Party to participate in any meetings. The question is whether the Party is willing to accept the supervision of the democratic parties, such as not inviting the democratic parties to participate in Party committee meetings."

Sixth, opposing progressive theories, and deliberately distorting phenomena in our country's life in the name of academic research. When explaining the cause of "myocardial hydropic degeneration," Ma Futing said that it was caused by the people's lack of food, malnutrition, and lack of vitamin B after liberation. When Tang Jiachen lectured on psychiatry, he only spread poison, saying that "the more society develops, the more mental illnesses there are," "soldiers have the most mental illnesses because soldiers are afraid of death," "old cadres are all mentally ill," and "Party members and League members reporting to the organization are also symptoms of mental illness."

    马馥庭唐家琛疯狂已极
    纠集右派分子全面向党进攻
    本报讯　兰州医学院举行了多次反右派斗争大会揭露以病理学教授马馥庭、神经病学教授唐家琛为首的反共集团。这个集团于1952年已经形成，其骨干有刘尚哲、毛经纬、陈光华、魏斌等。在这个反共集团的成员中80％以上或出身于反动阶级的家庭，或参加反革命组织，或其亲属被斗、被押、被判刑，或曾是肃反的对象。如马馥庭是甘肃省青年党的党魁，唐家琛是反动的高级军官，刘逢举是汉奸，俞魁是反革命组织
  “正义会”的主要负责人之一。在大鸣大放期间，以这个反共集团为核心，纠集了全院大小反共集团，形成了反共大联盟，全面向党展开大进攻。
    根据揭发和右派分子已承认的材料，证明这群右派分子是从以下几个方面向党进攻的。
    首先是反对党的领导。马馥庭公开提出办大学的方针：“我认为是依靠内行，就是教授和教学人员。”唐家琛则宣扬：“解放前许多大学没有党委也办得很好。”又说：“美国没有党委制，大学也办得很好。”
    第二，反对社会主义制度。唐家琛说：“我过去认为兰州、西北、兰州医学院落后，现在看来是全国性的，所以我怀疑是不是制度问题。”当全国右派分子攻击社会主义制度时，他又说：“英雄所见略同，天下老鸦一般黑。”这些右派分子还说“社会主义制度下人是不平等的”。
    第三，反对马列主义。他们公开向学校提出要求：“精简马列主义、革命历史课。”他们中有的人在考试后，撕毁马列主义题签，并特意在日记上以“火烧马列主义”为题作文章。
    第四，反对党的各项政策。右派分子对党的每一个运动、每一项政策都极端仇视。马馥庭说思想改造运动是“强词夺理，鸡毛里挑骨头”。唐家琛就说思想改造令人“寒心、伤心、灰心、担心！”刘尚哲诬蔑肃反运动是“屈打成招”。马馥庭大喊：“我赞成罗隆基提出的平反委员会。”
    第五，挑拨党同民主党派的关系。他们说“沟”和“墙”是共产党造成的。他还恶意诬蔑：“这个墙就像万里长城一样，党委应当带头拆，不要让人家像孟姜女一样哭断长城。”唐家琛歪曲相互监督的内容说：“民主党派是欢迎党来监督的，提供了这样的条件，比如有什么会都请党来参加。问题在于党是否愿意接受民主党派的监督，如党委会开会就不叫民主党派参加。”
    第六，反对进步学说，以研究学术为名，故意歪曲我国生活中的现象。马馥庭在解释发生“心肌水泡变性”原因时，说是因为解放后人民缺少粮食、营养不足、缺少维他命B所致。唐家琛在讲精神病学时，一味传播毒素，说“社会愈发展、精神病愈多”，“精神病以士兵最多，因为士兵是恐惧怕死”，“老干部都是精神病”，“党团员向组织汇报也是精神症状”。
