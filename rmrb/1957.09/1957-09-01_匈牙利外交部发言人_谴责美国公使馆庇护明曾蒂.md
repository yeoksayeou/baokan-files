Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 31st. Hungarian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Jaros said at a press conference on August 30th that the US Legation in Hungary granting Mindszenty the right of residence is not only an abuse of diplomatic privilege but also a blatant interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

Jaros said that Hungary sentencing its own citizens is purely an internal matter, whether it is for general political prisoners or criminal offenders. Some people believe that diplomatic envoys are allowed to temporarily grant residence to people when the host country is in a state of chaos and people's lives are threatened. But even according to this statement, now that law and order have been restored, this practice is wrong.

Jaros pointed out that the US State Department's 1939 regulations on diplomatic residence also only stipulate granting residence to those fugitives whose lives are directly threatened by mass riots, but this can only last until the danger is eliminated.

Mindszenty was a reactionary cardinal in Hungary who was arrested in 1948 for attempting to subvert the people's democratic regime. During the counter-revolutionary riots last October, he was released from prison by counter-revolutionaries and fled to the US Legation in Hungary, where he openly advocated for the complete elimination of the people's democratic system.

    匈牙利外交部发言人
    谴责美国公使馆庇护明曾蒂
    新华社布达佩斯31日电  匈牙利外交部发言人贾罗什8月30日在记者招待会上说，美国驻匈牙利公使馆给予明曾蒂居留权不但是滥用外交特权，而且是对匈牙利内政的公然干涉。
    贾罗什说，匈牙利判处自己的公民纯粹是内政问题，不管是对一般政治犯或者刑事犯都完全一样。有人认为，外交使节在驻在国处于混乱状态、人民生命受到威胁的时候，暂时给人以居留权是可以允许的。但是即使按照这种说法，现在法律和秩序已经恢复，那么这种作法也是不对的。
    贾罗什指出，美国国务院1939年关于外交居留权的规定也只规定给予那些由于群众暴乱而生命受到直接威胁的逃亡者以居留权，但这只能到危险消除时为止。
    明曾蒂是匈牙利的反动的红衣主教，在1948年因企图颠覆人民民主政权被捕。去年10月反革命暴乱期间，他被反革命分子从狱中释放，逃到美国驻匈牙利公使馆，他当时公开主张要彻底消灭人民民主制度。
