Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: The anti-Rightist struggle at the Third National Women's Congress of China, held this afternoon, reached a climax.

	The meeting began at 3:00 PM. Xu Guangping, Chairman of the Credentials Committee, delivered a report on the review of delegates' qualifications. The report indicated that the election of all 1,297 delegates to this Congress complied with regulations, their qualifications as delegates were valid, and she requested the Congress to review and approve it.

	Amidst warm applause, the heads of the Albanian Women's Delegation, E. Trezi, the German Democratic Republic Women's Delegation, R. Schirmer, and the Romanian Women's Delegation, Dr. E. Virkoci, addressed the Congress with congratulations and presented gifts to the Congress.

	Major General Li Zhen spoke at the Congress on behalf of women in the military, refuting the crimes of Rightist elements in the women's community, such as Liu Wang Liming. Li Zhen concluded by stating that women in the military must thoroughly overcome non-proletarian thoughts and successfully pass the socialist test. They should also respond to the call for building the country and managing households through diligence and thrift, carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living of the People's Liberation Army, and strive for the socialist construction of the motherland and the regularization and modernization of the army.

	Wu Ailian, a women's representative from the old revolutionary base area in Jiangxi, recalled in her speech the arduous struggle waged by women and men in the old base area under the leadership of the Party during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. She said that the people of the old base area, for their own liberation and for the establishment of a happy socialist country, shed blood, sacrificed themselves, and endured all kinds of hardships to wage a resolute struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Although the events occurred more than twenty years ago, it felt like yesterday when she recalled them. When the revolution temporarily suffered setbacks, women lived in misery; the reactionaries cursed the revolutionaries as "bandits" and us as "bandits' wives," but we firmly believed that the revolution would eventually be victorious. Now, we have won, the Communist Party has brought us happiness, we firmly support the leadership of the Communist Party, and the women of our old base area will unite with the people of the whole country to resolutely fight the Rightist elements to the end!

	Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation, said that Rightist elements have now been severely attacked and abandoned by the broad masses of women in Beijing. She said that by the end of August, more than 110,000 women from the streets of Beijing alone had participated in rallies denouncing the Rightist elements. Zhang Xiaomei refuted the fallacies of the Rightist elements at the meeting by citing facts and systematically exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of Li Jiansheng, a Rightist element in the women's community in Beijing.

	Yang Jianqing, a family member of an industrialist and businessman, spoke at the meeting. Yang Jianqing is the wife of Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce. She said that in the past, she thought she had realized the shamefulness of exploitation, but in the depths of her mind, she still felt that "exploitation is shameful, but fixed interest is lovely." Through this anti-Rightist struggle, she said that she understood that her past so-called acceptance of transformation was superficial; without a sharp ideological struggle and a thorough transformation, it would be impossible to change her bourgeois stand.

	Meng Na, an old actress who returned from Hong Kong in 1950 to participate in the people's film industry, said in her speech that Yang Naimei, an early Chinese actress, is now impoverished and begging on the streets of Hong Kong; Tang Ruoqing, a famous actress in the drama circle, lives in opium dens in Kowloon all day long, looking neither human nor ghostly. She said that this is the road that the Rightist elements want us to take. Meng Na also described how the People's Government provided learning opportunities and good living conditions to old actors from the silent film era who were about to be eliminated in the old society, such as Wang Hanlun and Xuan Jinglin, and also tried to find ways to treat Zhou Xuan's illness. She said that the lives in the new and old societies are so significantly different, and the Rightist elements' attempt to restore the decadent, dark, and cannibalistic society is nothing but a delusion.

	Model teacher Tao Shufan and Fu Xuewen, head of the Beijing branch of the Chinese Women's Temperance Union, also spoke at the meeting today, exposing Liu Wang Liming's reactionary words and deeds. Wang Feng, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), also spoke.

	At the meeting, an old delegate, Li Runchen, who was sixty years old, went to Ding Ling during the break and asked, "How many years have you been a member of the Party?" Ding Ling said, "More than twenty years." Li Runchen said, "The Party has educated you for so many years, but today you want to engage in anti-Party activities, drag down socialism, and dig up the roots of socialism. How can you be worthy of the Party, the people, and the broad masses of women by doing this?" Li Runchen asked Ding Ling to conduct a deep self-criticism and thoroughly confess. Under this righteous and stern criticism, Ding Ling was speechless.

	This morning, representatives from various regions continued to hold group meetings.

　　来自各方的代表义正词严驳斥右派
　　全国妇代会反右派斗争进入高潮
    据新华社12日讯　今天下午举行的中国妇女第三次全国代表大会会议上，妇女界反击右派的斗争进入了高潮。
    下午三时会议开始时，代表资格审查委员会主任委员许广平在会上作了关于代表资格的审查报告。报告中指明，本届一千二百九十七名代表的选举都符合规定，她们的代表资格都是有效的，她请求大会审议通过。
    阿尔巴尼亚妇女代表团团长埃·特雷齐、德意志民主共和国妇女代表团团长鲁·席尔默和罗马尼亚妇女代表团团长埃·维尔科奇博士在热烈的掌声中向大会致词祝贺，并向大会赠送了礼物。
    李贞少将代表军队中的妇女在大会上发言，她驳斥了妇女界右派分子刘王立明等的罪行。李贞最后提出，军队中的妇女，还要彻底克服非无产阶级思想，过好社会主义这一关。并且要响应勤俭建国、勤俭持家的号召，发扬人民解放军艰苦朴素的光荣传统，为祖国的社会主义建设和军队的正规化现代化建设而努力。
    江西革命老根据地的妇女代表吴爱莲，在发言中回忆了第二次国内革命战争时期老区妇女和男人一道在党的领导下所进行的艰苦斗争。她说，老根据地的人民为了自身的解放，为了建立幸福的社会主义国家，流血牺牲，历尽千辛万苦，向国民党反动派作了坚决的斗争。事情虽然已经过去二十多年，但回想起来好像就在昨天。当革命暂时遭到失败的时候，妇女就在苦水里过日子，反动派骂革命的人是“土匪”，骂我们是“土匪婆”，但我们坚信革命总有胜利的一天。现在，我们胜利了，共产党给我们带来了幸福，我们坚决拥护共产党的领导，我们老根据地的妇女要和全国人民一道，坚决向右派分子斗争到底！
    北京市妇联主席张晓梅说，右派分子现在已经遭到北京广大妇女的痛击和唾弃。她说，到8月底为止，仅是北京的街道上就有十一万多妇女群众参加了声讨右派分子的集会。张晓梅在会上列举事实驳斥了右派分子的谬论，并且系统地揭露和批判了北京市妇女界右派分子李健生的反动言行。
    工商界家属杨鉴清在会上发了言，杨鉴清是上海市工商联副主任委员荣毅仁的妻子。她说，过去她自认为已经认识到剥削的可耻，其实在思想深处还是“剥削可耻，定息可爱”。通过这次反右派斗争，她说她明白了过去的所谓接受改造是表面的；不经过尖锐的思想斗争，不经过脱胎换骨的改造，是不可能转变资产阶级立场的。
    1950年从香港回来参加人民电影事业的老演员蒙纳在发言中说，我国早期的女演员杨耐梅现在潦倒在香港街头，做了叫化子；话剧界名演员唐若青终日生活在九龙的大烟馆里，弄的人不像人，鬼不像鬼。她说，这就是右派分子希望我们走的道路。蒙纳还叙述了人民政府给予在旧社会要被淘汰掉的默片时代的老演员，如王汉伦、宣景琳等人以学习的机会，给予很好的生活待遇，还想办法给周璇治病的情况。她说，新旧社会的生活是这样显著的不同，右派分子想恢复腐朽、黑暗、人吃人的社会，那只是妄想。
    今天在会上发言的还有模范教师陶淑范、中华妇女节制会北京分会负责人傅学文，她们揭露了刘王立明的反动言行。另外发言的还有民革成员王枫。
    会上，一位六十岁的老代表李润琛在休息时间走去问丁玲：“你入党多少年了？”丁玲说：“二十几年了。”李润琛说：“党教育了你这么多年，到今天你反而要进行反党活动，扯社会主义的腿，挖社会主义的根。你这样做怎么能对得起党、对得起人民、对得起广大妇女？”李润琛要丁玲深刻检讨，彻底交代。丁玲在这种义正辞严的批评下，无言对答。
    今天上午，各地代表继续举行小组会。
