Refuting Zhang Yingnan's Fallacy of "Equal Emphasis on New and Old Laws"
Li Qi

During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, Zhang Yingnan, under the guise of helping the Party to rectify its work style, published a series of reactionary remarks, shooting many poisonous arrows at the Party and the people, attempting to restore the old laws and the old jurisprudence, and plotting to usurp the leadership of political and legal work. "Equal emphasis on new and old laws" is one of the poisonous arrows he shot, and it is also a reactionary general program and general slogan for his attack on the Party and the people.

What does "equal emphasis on new and old laws" mean? Zhang Yingnan explained, "New laws alone are not enough, there must also be old laws"; the new and old should be "integrated and used." He believes that "old laws also have a side of truth," and should be "purified of falsehood and refined," and "cannot be completely rejected."

Can new and old laws be "equally emphasized"? Anyone with a little knowledge of Marxism-Leninism would say no. Why? Because law is the expression of the will of the ruling class, and a certain law serves a certain class. There is no such thing as a law that transcends classes. The Kuomintang's laws protect the interests of landlords, bureaucrats, and the bourgeoisie, and are tools for suppressing and exploiting the broad masses of working people. Our laws, on the other hand, protect the interests of the broad masses of working people, and are tools for suppressing all counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements who undermine socialist construction, and serve socialism. The two are not only fundamentally different, but also directly opposed, so how can they be "equally emphasized"? How can they be "integrated and used"?

As everyone knows, the Kuomintang had an "Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China," which was specifically used to suppress communists and patriots; we have a "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," which is specifically used to deal with counter-revolutionary elements. May I ask Zhang Yingnan: How can these two laws be "equally emphasized"? How can they be "integrated and used"? Is it both to suppress counter-revolutionary elements and to kill communists? Is there such a country and regime in the world? As everyone knows, the Kuomintang had a land law (Zhang Yingnan once taught this land law in university), which protected the land ownership of the landlord class's feudal exploitation; we have a "Land Reform Law," the first article of which stipulates: "Abolish the land ownership of the landlord class's feudal exploitation." May I ask Zhang Yingnan: How can these two sets of laws be "equally emphasized"? How can they be "integrated and used"? Is it to protect the land ownership of the landlord class's feudal exploitation, or to abolish the land ownership of the landlord class's feudal exploitation?

The matter is very clear, either the old laws are abolished, or the old laws are restored; one of the two must be the case. The so-called equal emphasis on new and old laws, the so-called "integrated use" of new and old laws, is simply a deceptive lie, and absolutely impossible. Zhang Yingnan loudly calls for equal emphasis on new and old laws, simply to find a way for the old laws to be restored, to restore the old laws in China, thereby dragging China back to the dark and reactionary era.

Zhang Yingnan said, "Old laws also have a side of truth." This is nonsense. The so-called old laws are all the laws of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppressed the people, which we call pseudo-laws. The Chinese people have never believed that there is any truth in the Kuomintang's pseudo-laws, but believe that they are "the shackles of the broad masses of working people in China." Law has class character, and truth in law also has class character. What the exploiting class considers good and virtuous, the exploited class considers bad and evil; and vice versa. Therefore, all the laws of the Kuomintang government that oppressed the people should not be "purified of falsehood and refined," but should be completely abolished and completely rejected. Is this not very clear? Zhang Yingnan, eight years after liberation, believes that the Kuomintang's pseudo-Six Codes still have a "side of truth," and is still defending the old laws. This can only show that he is still standing on the reactionary class's position.

Regarding whether the old laws still have a "side of truth," we can further analyze it from the specific facts cited by Zhang Yingnan. Zhang Yingnan attacked our constitution's provision that "the National People's Congress is the sole organ for exercising state legislative power," believing that it is not a "good system," and wants us to adopt the Kuomintang reactionaries' system of "Central Political Conference" exercising state legislative power, believing that it is a "good system," believing that it is the "side of truth." As everyone knows, the Kuomintang's "Central Political Conference" was an organization under the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. The exercise of state legislative power by such an organization as the "Central Political Conference" was precisely the most blatant manifestation of the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship during the period of political tutelage after its betrayal of the revolution in 1927. However, Zhang Yingnan believes that this is a "good system," a "side of truth," and a good way to "separate the decision-making organ from the executive organ." Our constitution's provision of the legislative system, on the other hand, is not a "good system," but "the Party and the government are not separated, and the Party replaces the government." Everyone can see, to what extent Zhang Yingnan admires the old laws and despises the new laws, and to what extent he has reversed black and white and confused right and wrong. Not only that, Zhang Yingnan also believes that our current procuratorial system, supervision system, and people's letters and visits system are not "good systems," but wants us to adopt the bureaucratic, formalistic, and convenient for officials to protect each other's "administrative appeals" and "administrative litigation" systems of capitalist countries. He said: "Administrative litigation and appeals were originally the state system of the bourgeoisie, ... but this system is still a very good system." He also believes: "If we establish this system... we can provide a definite and substantial guarantee for the rights and interests of the people." (See "On the Issue of Administrative Supervision in Administrative Law," published in the fourth issue of the "Contention" magazine of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, February 1957) Enough, the matter is already very clear, what Zhang Yingnan calls a "good system," what "side of truth," is originally these decadent and rotten things that he fished out from the abyss of the Kuomintang's sinful darkness, originally he wants to revive these reactionary old legal systems that have long been spurned by the people!

Secondly, the second point of Zhang Yingnan's "equal emphasis on new and old laws" is to restore the old jurisprudence. He believes that "relying solely on Marxism-Leninism is not enough, Marxism-Leninism can only be a pointer." Relying solely on Marxism-Leninism is not enough, may I ask what else should we rely on? Is it capitalism or fascism? Is it Poundism or Kelsenism?

From the sentence "relying solely on Marxism-Leninism is not enough," it also reveals Zhang Yingnan's understanding of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." He regards Marxism-Leninism as one of the hundred schools, and believes that in addition to Marxism-Leninism, there are ninety-nine other schools. Since Marxism-Leninism only accounts for 1% of the territory, no wonder he shouts that "relying solely on Marxism-Leninism is not enough." Zhang Yingnan does not understand that "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is actually a contention between two schools—Marxism-Leninism and non-Marxism-Leninism—and the result of the contention will inevitably be that Marxism-Leninism will defeat non-Marxism-Leninism.

Jurisprudence belongs to the category of social sciences, which is different from natural sciences. Because the object of natural science research is natural phenomena rather than social phenomena, "Marxism-Leninism can only be a pointer," only providing natural scientists with a correct worldview and outlook on life, providing a general and basic research method for engaging in scientific research, but cannot replace natural science. Social science is different. The object of social science research is social phenomena, class struggle, and Marxism-Leninism is the science of class struggle, a true social science, which is opposed to all reactionary bourgeois "social sciences." Jurisprudence is a part of social science. Today, apart from Marxism-Leninism being the only correct jurisprudence, all bourgeois jurisprudence (including Zhang Yingnan's bourgeois administrative jurisprudence) is reactionary, deceptive, poisonous weeds, not fragrant flowers, objects of criticism, not to be "recalled" and revived in China. Letting a hundred schools of thought contend is by no means to restore bourgeois jurisprudence, so that bourgeois jurisprudence and Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence can "stand on equal footing" and "share the same scenery"—as Zhang Yingnan thought, or even let it replace Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence, to change the direction of the development of Chinese jurisprudence, but to more thoroughly expose and criticize bourgeois jurisprudence, to better and faster develop Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence, thereby eliminating the influence of bourgeois jurisprudence among the people. This is the consistent policy of our Party and the country. But Zhang Yingnan said: "Relying solely on Marxism-Leninism is not enough," and even said, "Only by learning and transforming on the old basis can we adapt to the needs." This view is completely wrong and reactionary. It must be pointed out that all old legal scholars and old legal personnel who do not thoroughly discard their bourgeois jurisprudential baggage, who do not "completely reject" bourgeois jurisprudential thought, and who attempt to "learn and transform on the old basis," will never learn well, never transform well, and will never adapt to the needs of the people. Zhang Yingnan has been "learning and transforming on the old basis" for eight years, and is still full of bourgeois thoughts, and still insists on using bourgeois thoughts to change the socialist direction of China. Is this not the best explanation? And some other old legal scholars and old legal personnel, due to having a higher level of awareness in recent years, seriously transforming themselves, and gradually establishing their Marxist-Leninist worldview and legal views, thereby making contributions to the people's cause, this is the two different paths taken by old legal scholars and old legal personnel in the eight years after liberation. I hope that all old legal scholars and old legal personnel who are willing to transform themselves and sincerely do something for the people should learn a lesson from this.

The third point of Zhang Yingnan's "equal emphasis on new and old laws" is to allow old legal personnel to return to power. In order to achieve his despicable goal, he described the legal circles after liberation as a pitch-black mass, viciously attacking our Party's leadership of political and legal work. He said: "The Party sees the law too simply." He said: "Due to the government's lack of attention in recent years, jurisprudence has become a weak link." He also said: "Now the legal circles are small in quantity and weak in quality, and few people in the legislative and judicial organs understand the law." He believes that the leading cadres in the political and legal departments do not understand the law, are "laymen," and cannot lead the work. Therefore, he proposed that "certain senior Party cadres who work in the political and legal departments but do not understand political and legal work should be reassigned and should not be placed in positions that hinder other non-Party cadres who are familiar with the work from exercising their functions." He proposed to "appropriately arrange and use the old legal personnel who have retired, transferred, and been idle in the past, as long as they are useful," and "cannot reject them all because of their old legal views." Is this not calling for the Communist Party to step down? Is this not blatantly competing with the Communist Party for leadership of political and legal work? We can say with certainty that the right-wing elements' conspiracy and ambition will absolutely not succeed. It is absolutely impossible to drive the Communist Party out of power, let those untransformed old legal personnel return to power, and put the political and legal knives into their hands, so that China can return to the old road of capitalism and colonialism. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of the whole country.

Combining the above analysis, we can clearly see that the "theory of equal emphasis on new and old laws" advocated by Zhang Yingnan is actually to replace revolutionary laws with reactionary laws, to replace Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence with bourgeois jurisprudence, and to replace communists with old legal personnel. This is a vicious arrow, a great conspiracy, and we must thoroughly expose and smash it.

　　驳张映南“新旧法应该并重”的谬论
　　李琪
    张映南在这次大鸣大放期间，借帮助党整风之名，发表了一系列的反动言论，向党和人民射了许多毒箭，妄图使旧法复辟，使旧法学复辟，并阴谋篡夺政法工作的领导权。“新旧法应该并重”，就是他射出的一枝毒箭，同时也是他向党和人民进攻的一个反动的总纲领和总口号。
    “新旧法应该并重”是什么意思呢？张映南解释道：“只有新的不够，还必须有旧的”；新旧应该“融合来用”。他认为“旧法也有真理的一面”，应该“去伪存真，去粗取精”，“不能一棍子打死”。
    新旧法律是不是可以“并重”呢？凡是稍有一点马列主义常识的人都会说不可以。为什么？因为法律是统治阶级意志的表现，一定的法律是为一定的阶级服务的，超阶级的法律是不存在的。国民党的法律是保护地主官僚资产阶级的利益，是镇压和剥削广大劳动人民的工具。而我们的法律，是保护广大劳动人民的利益，是镇压一切反革命分子和破坏社会主义建设的坏分子的工具，是为社会主义服务的。两者不仅根本不同，而且正相反对，怎么能够“并重”呢？怎么能够“融合来用”呢？
    大家知道，国民党有一个“危害民国紧急治罪法”，是专门用来镇压共产党人和爱国人士的；我们有一个“惩治反革命条例”，是专门用来对付反革命分子的。试问张映南：这两个法律怎样“并重”法？怎样“融合来用”？是不是既镇压反革命分子，又杀害共产党人呢？天下还有这样的国家和政权吗？大家知道，国民党有个土地法（张映南曾在大学里教过这个土地法），它是保护地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制的；我们有个“土地改革法”，它的第一条就规定：“废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制”。试问张映南：这两组法律又怎样“并重”呢？又怎样“融合来用”呢？究竟是保护地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制呢，还是废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制呢？
    事情非常明显，或者是把旧法废除，或者是让旧法复辟，二者必居其一。所谓新旧法律并重，所谓新旧法律“融合来用”，根本是骗人的鬼话，是绝对办不到的事。张映南大喊大叫要新旧法律并重，无非是想给旧法找复辟的道路，要在中国复辟旧法，从而把中国再拖回到黑暗反动的时代。
    张映南说，“旧法也有真理的一面”。这是胡说。所谓旧法，就是国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律，我们称它为伪法。中国人民从不认为国民党的伪法中还有真理，而认为它“是中国广大劳动人民的枷锁”。法律是有阶级性的，法律方面的真理也是有阶级性的。剥削阶级认为是好的、善的，被剥削阶级则认为是坏的、恶的；反之亦然。因之，对国民党政府一切压迫人民的法律，决不是什么“去伪存真，去粗取精”，而是要完全废除，一棍子打死，这难道还不很清楚吗？张映南在解放后的八年的今天，认为国民党的伪六法全书还有“真理的一面”，还在为旧法辩护，这只能说明他还是站在反动阶级立场罢了。
    关于旧法是不是还有“真理的一面”，我们还可以进一步从张映南所举出的具体事实来加以分析。张映南攻击我们宪法上规定的“全国人民代表大会是行使国家立法权的唯一机关”的制度，认为它不是“良好的制度”，而要我们采取国民党反动派的由“中央政治会议”行使国家立法权的制度，认为那是“良好的制度”，认为那是“真理的一面”。大家知道，国民党的“中央政治会议”是国民党中央执行委员会下的一个机构。由“中央政治会议”这样一个机构行使国家立法权，正是国民党1927年叛变革命后，在血腥统治的训政时期实行一党专政最露骨的表现。可是张映南却认为这是一种“良好的制度”，是“真理的一面”，是“决策机关与执行机关分开”的好办法。而我们宪法上规定的立法体制，反而不是“良好的制度”，而是“党政不分，以党代政”。大家看看，张映南崇拜旧法、鄙视新法到了什么程度，颠倒黑白，混淆是非到了什么程度。不仅如此，张映南还认为我们现行的检察制度、监察制度以及人民来信来访制度都不是“良好的制度”，而要我们采取资本主义国家的官僚主义的、形式主义的、便于官官相卫的“行政诉愿”和“行政诉讼”制度。他说：“行政诉讼和诉愿，原本是资产阶级的国家制度，……但是这种制度还是一种很好的制度。”他并认为：“我们如建立起这种制度……就可以为人民的权利和利益做到确切实在的保证。”（见“关于行政法上的行政监督问题”一文，载民盟中央机关刊物“争鸣”第四期，1957年2月）够了，事情已经很明显了，张映南所说什么“良好的制度”，什么“真理的一面”，原来就是他从国民党罪恶的黑暗的深渊里捞出来的这些腐朽透顶的东西，原来就是他要使这些早被人民唾弃的反动的旧的法律制度复活！
    其次，张映南所说的“新旧法应该并重”的第二点，就是要复辟旧法学。他认为“单靠马列主义是不够的，马列主义只能做个指针。”单靠马列主义不够，试问还要靠什么呢？是不是要靠资本主义或者法西斯主义？是不是要靠庞德主义或者凯尔生主义？
    从“单靠马列主义是不够的”这句话里，也透露了张映南对“百家争鸣”的了解，他是把马列主义看作百家中的一家的，他认为除马列主义外还有九十九家。马列主义既然只占1％的地盘，无怪乎他要喊“单靠马列主义是不够的”了。张映南不懂得“百家争鸣”实际上就是两家——马列主义和非马列主义——争鸣，而争鸣的结果马列主义必定要战胜非马列主义。
    法学是属于社会科学的范畴，它和自然科学不同。自然科学因为研究的对象，是自然现象而不是社会现象，因之“马列主义只能做个指针”，只是为自然科学家提供一个正确的世界观和人生观，提供一个从事科学研究的一般的也是基本的研究方法，而不能代替自然科学。社会科学则不同。社会科学研究的对象是社会现象，是阶级斗争，而马列主义就是阶级斗争的科学，是真正的社会科学，而与一切反动的资产阶级“社会科学”相对立。法学是社会科学一部分，今天除了马列主义是唯一正确的法学以外，一切资产阶级的法学（包括张映南的资产阶级行政法学在内），都是反动的，骗人的，都是毒草，而不是香花，都是批判的对象，而不是为它“招魂”、要它在中国复活。百家争鸣，决不是再恢复资产阶级法学，使资产阶级法学与马列主义法学“分庭抗礼”，“平分秋色”——如张映南所想的那样，甚至让它取马列主义法学而代之，以改变中国法学发展的方向，而是为了更彻底地揭露和批判资产阶级法学，更好更快地发展马列主义法学，从而肃清资产阶级法学在人民群众中的影响。这是我们的党和国家的一贯方针。而张映南却说：“单靠马列主义是不够的”，甚至说，“只有在旧的基础上学习改造，才能适应需要”。这种观点，是完全错误的、反动的。必须指出，一切旧法学者和旧法人员不彻底丢掉自己的资产阶级的法学包袱，不把资产阶级法学思想“一棍子打死”，要企图在“旧的基础上学习改造”，那是永远也学不好、改不好的，永远也不会适应人民的需要的。张映南在“旧的基础上学习改造”已经八年了，到现在还满脑子资产阶级的思想，还硬要以资产阶级思想来改变中国的社会主义的方向，这不是最好的说明吗？而另一些旧法学者、旧法人员，由于几年来有了较高的觉悟，认真地改造自己，使自己的马列主义的世界观、法律观逐步建立起来，从而为人民事业作出了贡献，这是解放后八年来旧法学家、旧法人员所走的两条不同道路。我希望一切愿意改造自己真心为人民做些事的旧法学家和旧法人员，应该从这里取得教训。
    张映南所说的“新旧法应该并重”的第三点，就是要使旧法人员重新上台。为了实现他的这一卑鄙目的，他把解放后的法律界说成是黑漆一团，恶毒地攻击我们党对政法工作的领导。他说：“党把法律看得太简单”。说：“由于几年来政府不重视，法学已成为薄弱的一环”。又说：“现在法学界量少质弱，立法机关、司法机关懂得法的人很少。”他认为政法部门领导干部不懂法律，是“外行”，不能领导业务，因之，他提出“在政法部门工作而不懂政法业务的某些高级党员干部，应另作安置，不应放在业务岗位上妨碍其他熟悉业务的党外干部行使职权”。他提出要“把过去退休的、转业的、闲置的旧法人员，凡有用处的，加以适当安排，使用起来”，“不能一律以旧法观点拒之”。这不是叫共产党下台是什么？这不是明目张胆地在和共产党争夺政法工作的领导权是什么？我们肯定地说，右派分子这种阴谋野心，是绝对不能得逞的。要把共产党赶下台，让那些没有经过改造的旧法人员重新上台，把政法刀把子拿到他们手中，使中国再回到资本主义的、殖民地的老路上去，是绝对办不到的，这是全国人民决不能允许的。
    综合以上的分析，我们可以清楚地看出：张映南所倡导的“新旧法并重论”实际上就是要以反动的法律代替革命的法律，以资产阶级的法学代替马列主义的法学，以旧法人员代替共产党人。这是一枝恶毒的箭，一个大阴谋，我们必须彻底地予以揭露和粉碎。
