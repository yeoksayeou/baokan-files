Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 5th: All six major capital construction units in Shenyang have decided to complete this year's capital construction plans before the freeze in mid-November.

Shenyang has a total construction volume of 1.24 million square meters this year; currently, over 1.1 million square meters of factory buildings, warehouses, dormitories, and other projects are under intense construction. Because most projects started later this year, only 58% of the annual construction task was completed by the end of August. The remaining workload must be completed in the final two and a half months of the construction season.

In order to ensure the completion of this arduous task with good quality, speed, quantity, economy, and safety, various capital construction units have adopted a number of emergency measures. For the most urgently needed building materials such as bricks, tiles, small hardware, and plumbing equipment, they are being resolved through increasing production and finding sources of supply.

Currently, all capital construction units have also organized a general quality inspection based on quality issues that have arisen in the progress of the projects and have taken improvement measures.

    争取封冻前完成施工计划
    沈阳基本建设单位采取多种紧急措施
    据新华社沈阳5日电　沈阳全市六个主要基本建设单位决定在11月中旬封冻以前完成今年基本建设计划。
    沈阳今年全年有一百二十四万平方公尺基本建设的工程量；目前有一百一十多万平方公尺的厂房、仓库、宿舍等工程，正在紧张施工。因为今年大部分工程开工较晚，到8月底为止，全年的施工任务已经完成58％，其余的工程量要在最后两个半月的施工季节内完成。
    各基本建设单位为了保证好、快、多、省、安全地完成这一艰巨任务，采取了多项紧急措施。对于目前最急需的砖、瓦、小五金、水暖器材等各种建筑材料，正在通过增加生产、寻找货源等办法加以解决。
    目前各基本建设单位还根据工程进展中出现的质量问题，组织了一次普遍的质量检查，并且采取了改进措施。
