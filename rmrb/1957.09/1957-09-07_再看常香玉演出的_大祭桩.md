Having seen Chang Xiangyu perform several times, one gets the feeling that each time you watch her perform a play, you gain new insights. From 1951 to 1956, I saw her perform "Interrogation of Hong" four times in different years, and each time she had new creations. The performance of "The Big Sacrifice Stake" is the same. This time she came to the capital to perform, and with the same mindset as watching her plays like "Interrogation of Hong," I watched her play again. Sure enough, she delved deeper and more meticulously into the character and inner world of Huang Guiying.

In the first scene, Chang Xiangyu, as usual, entered the stage with her acting. After singing the "Er Ba Ban" with anger and pain in the inner stage: "I hate my father for being unjust," she rushed onto the stage, suddenly stopped in the middle, her eyes fixed on the front right, her facial muscles and the corners of her mouth twitching slightly. Then, with hurried steps, she went upstairs, entered the inner room, and collapsed on the table. This performance vividly expresses Huang Guiying's extreme pain and anger after suddenly hearing the terrible news that her beloved fiancé, Li Yangui, would soon be executed due to the persecution of her snobbish and heartless father. This sudden and irresistible blow almost drove her mad. After collapsing on the table for a moment, she seemed to regain consciousness, and this reality caused her intense conflict: what to do? She suddenly walked quickly inside, indicating her determination to follow her fiancé to death. But she stopped again, slowly retreating, and finally sang: "If I die now, I will die unjustly, Li Lang will blame me for breaking my oath. If I die now, I will die unjustly, how can Li Lang know my heart?..." This concentrated and refined performance and singing vividly portrayed Huang Guiying's strong love and hate, her stubborn character of preferring death to living in dishonor, and her brave spirit of boldly leaving her father and going to the sacrifice stake. The psychological struggle was performed with clear layers and was very moving.

"Hitting the Road" is the most brilliant scene in this play. Chang Xiangyu put in more effort and developed more creativity in this scene. The first half of the scene, through Huang Guiying's struggle with the violent wind and rain and the muddy road, further demonstrates her indomitable will. She skillfully used several different sliding and falling body movements. In particular, the combination of forward sliding and backward falling was used extremely well, like a person walking in the mud, slipping and falling, and quickly moving the other foot to regain balance. This action is both realistic and very beautiful. After she fell and got up, she shook her hands twice to shake off the mud and water. This performance is so detailed and realistic. In the scene after Huang Guiying met her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, Chang Xiangyu understood Huang Guiying's character more deeply and comprehensively than before. She not only grasped her characteristics of boldness and bravery but also grasped another aspect of her character - the shyness and vanity of a young girl. When Guiying was beaten by her mother-in-law, Chang Xiangyu used many graceful shuffling steps, small steps, kneeling steps, and other body movements, and appropriately expressed Huang Guiying's fear and inexplicable feelings.

In this play, Chang Xiangyu brought her creative genius into full play in singing. According to the needs of the character's emotions, she not only selected and arranged various appropriate tempos, such as slow tempo, flowing tempo, Er Ba, flying tempo, etc., but also carefully designed and created every word and every sentence of the singing. She rarely moved the original melody intact and used it randomly. Every sentence has her own style. She used Xiangfu tune, and also used Yuxi tune. In some places, she also cleverly absorbed some elements of Hebei Bangzi and Henan folk songs. In a section of Er Ba Ban, when she sang "I miss him every day, suffering in the boudoir," she actually used the vibrato of female voices in Western singing for the word "suffering," which is a new creation. Moreover, what she absorbed can be melted into the Henan Opera singing, which not only correctly expresses the character's emotions but also does not make you feel stiff or detached from the style of Henan Opera. This play gave the audience great satisfaction in terms of singing.

"Creativity" should be the nature of all artists. Every excellent artist should achieve new achievements in artistic creation every day, and each performance of each play should have varying degrees of improvement and development. Comrade Chang Xiangyu is such an artist.

    再看常香玉演出的“大祭桩”
    李刚
    看过几次常香玉演出的人，都会有这样一种感觉：同是她演出的一个戏，多看一次，就会多感受到一些新的东西。从1951年到1956年间，我曾在几个不同年头看过她四次“拷红”，每一次她都有新的创造。“大祭桩”的演出，也是如此。这次她来首都演出，我抱着像看她的“拷红”等戏同样的心情，又观摩了她这个戏，果然，她对黄桂英这个人物的性格和内心，挖掘得更深刻、更细致了。
    在第一场戏里，常香玉照例是带戏出场的。她在里场以愤怒、痛苦的感情唱完一句“二八板”：“恼恨爹爹心不正”之后，冲出场来，在台中间顿然停住，两眼凝视着右前方，她的面部饥肉、嘴角在轻微的颤动，然后又以急促的步子上了楼，转入内室，一头伏在桌子上。这一段表演，鲜明的表现了黄桂英突然听到她心爱的未婚夫李彦贵因遭受她嫌贫爱富的狠心爹爹的迫害，不日就要问斩的凶信后的万分痛苦与愤恨的心情。这种突如其来的不可抗拒的打击，简直使她若痴若狂了。她在桌子上伏了一刻之后，好像才又清醒过来，在这种现实面前，引起了她剧烈的矛盾：怎么办？她突然以快速的步子向里边走去，表示她要追随未婚夫而死的决心。但她又停住了，慢慢的退转来，终于唱出：“俺今死，死不明，李郎怪我负誓盟，俺今死，死不明，李郎怎知我心情？……”这一段集中精练的表演和歌唱，把黄桂英的强烈的爱和恨，她宁肯一死不愿偷生移志的倔强性格，以及她大胆背父出走祭桩的勇敢精神，心理的矛盾斗争表演得层次分明，十分动人。
    “打路”是这个戏中最精彩的一场，常香玉在这场戏里下了更多的劳动、发挥了更多的创造性。上半场戏通过黄桂英和狂风暴雨、路途泥泞做斗争，更进一步表现了她的不屈的意志。她熟练的运用了几种不同的滑跌的身段，特别是那个前滑后跌联结并用的身段，用得极妙，活像一个人在泥泞中行走，滑了一跤，将要跌倒了，赶快又将另一只脚移动了一下，重新掌握了重心。这个动作既真实，又非常美。她跌倒后，爬了起来，两手抖了两下，要甩掉手上的泥和水。这种表演是多么细致而真实。在黄桂英遇见婆婆和嫂嫂以后的一段戏里，常香玉对黄桂英这个人物性格比以前理解得更深刻更全面了，不仅掌握了她的大胆、勇敢的特点，而且还掌握了她性格的另一方面——青年姑娘的羞怯和虚荣。当桂英遭受婆婆责打的时候，常香玉又运用了很多优美的蹉步、碎步、跪步等身段，并恰当的表现了黄桂英的惊惧和莫名其妙的心情。
    在这个戏里，常香玉在歌唱方面发挥了她的创造天才，根据角色感情的需要，她不仅选择和安排了各种适当的板眼，如慢板、流水、二八、飞板等等，而且对每一字、每一句唱腔都进行了精心的设计和创造，她很少把原有的曲调原封不动地搬来乱用的，每一句总有她自己的风格。她运用了祥符调，也运用了豫西调，有的地方她还巧妙的吸收了河北梆子、河南曲子的一些东西。在一段二八板中她唱到：“每日里思念他苦在绣楼”中的“苦”字时，她竟运用了西洋唱法中女声的颤音，这是新的创造。而且她所吸收的东西，都能溶化在豫剧的唱腔中，既正确的表现了角色的感情，又使你不感到生硬，不感到脱离豫剧的风格。这场戏在歌唱方面给予观众以很大的满足。
    “创造性”应该是一切艺术家的天性，一切优秀的艺术家，每天都应该在艺术创造中获得新的成就，每个戏的每次演出，也应该都有不同程度的提高和发展，常香玉同志却正是这样的一个艺术家。
