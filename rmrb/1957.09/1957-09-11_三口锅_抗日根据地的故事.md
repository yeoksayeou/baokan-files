　　Three Pots
　　——Stories from the Anti-Japanese Base Areas
　　Zhang Changgong
　　In the deep mountains and dense forests lived an old mother,
　　Every day she stood on the mountain rocks, longing for her loved ones,
　　At night, her hunched figure reflected the new moon,
　　In the morning, her sparse white hair was covered with green frost.
　　Her family was so poor they had no food for the next day,
　　Yet she had three pots, all the same size,
　　Whenever someone came to her house as a guest,
　　The pots would be filled with water and firewood prepared before the stove.
　　On those dark and windy nights,
　　Anti-Japanese heroes quietly came to her door,
　　They ate their fill of battle rations at the mother's place,
　　Then, like a sharp sword, they plunged into the enemy's heart.
　　The Japanese devils frantically searched for the guerrillas' base,
　　Searching the dense forests for more than ten days,
　　Finally, they discovered this lighthouse in the sea,
　　Killed the old mother, and smashed the pots to pieces.
　　Some say the old mother ascended into the clouds,
　　A golden glow shot out from the clouds, shining brilliantly,
　　She seemed to be riding on colorful clouds, calling upon the people everywhere,
　　From then on, the guerrillas had countless bases.
　　The thatched cottage is destroyed? It doesn't matter,
　　More thatched cottages are built in the mountains;
　　The pot is smashed? It doesn't matter,
　　The people's warm hearts will warm our dry rations!

　　三口锅
　　——抗日根据地的故事
　　张长弓
　　在深山密林里住着一位老妈妈，
　　她每天站在山岩上把亲人盼望，
　　夜晚，佝偻的身形映着新月，
　　早晨，稀疏的白发挂满青霜。
　　她家里穷得没有隔宿之粮，
　　却摆着一般大的三口锅，
　　是谁要来到她家里做客，
　　锅里注满清水灶前备好柴禾。
　　在那月黑风高的夜晚，
　　抗日健儿悄悄来到她的门前，
　　他们在妈妈这里饱餐战饭，
　　然后，像一把利剑插向敌人心间。
　　鬼子发疯似地寻觅游击队的据地，
　　在密林里一连搜索了十几天，
　　终于发现了这海中的灯塔，
　　杀死老妈妈，把锅砸得稀烂。
　　有人说老妈妈升入了云端，
　　一缕金霞射出云头光辉灿烂，
　　她仿佛驾着彩云到处号召人民，
　　从此游击队就有了无数据地。
　　茅屋毁了？不要紧，
　　有更多的茅屋搭在山间；
　　锅砸破了？不要紧，
　　人民火热的心会给我们把干粮烤暖！
