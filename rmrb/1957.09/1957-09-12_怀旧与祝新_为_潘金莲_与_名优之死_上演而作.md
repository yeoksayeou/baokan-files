Nostalgia and Best Wishes for the New
　　——On the Staging of "Pan Jinlian" and "Death of a Famous Actor"
　　Meng Chao
    I am extremely excited that the Beijing People's Art Theatre is staging "Pan Jinlian" and "Death of a Famous Actor" by comrades Ouyang Yuqian and Tian Han to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the spoken drama movement. Because my age is not much older than the age of Chinese spoken drama, I have personally seen past performances, or heard people who participated in past performances enthusiastically talk about the grand events of those years, so watching this performance again, I feel even more cordial and it evokes many memories.
    When "Pan Jinlian" was performed at the "Fish and Dragon Assembly," although the Chinese spoken drama movement already had nearly twenty years of history, it still marked the joint promotion of the new drama movement by spoken drama workers and progressive opera workers, leaving an indelible achievement. At that time, Ouyang Lao and Zhou Xinfang's Pan Jinlian and Wu Song, both with their profound performing arts, portrayed the thoughts and feelings of the two central characters and expressed the passionate spirit of the times. Others, such as Gao Baishui, Zhou Wubao, Tang Huaiqiu, and Tang Shuming, were also extremely well-matched. As one of the audience members who felt fortunate to witness this "rarely heard in the world" famous play, I was constantly moved in that small theater—in fact, just a small dining room—especially in the last scene, Wu Song's frankness and Pan Jinlian's bold rebellious mood. Now, thirty years later, the images on the stage still often linger in my mind.
    Comrade Ouyang Yuqian said: "I did not want to rehabilitate Pan Jinlian, I just wanted to show that the unreasonable marriage system, the shackles of feudal morality, and the oppression and trampling of women by rich and powerful men, can create tragic sins. I just wanted to use the character of Pan Jinlian to depict this contradiction." Yes, the slogan of women's liberation was put forward in the era of bourgeois democratic revolution; however, women can only truly be liberated in a socialist society. In a short period of fifty years, we have leaped over capitalist society and rapidly entered socialist society, the unreasonable marriage system has been completely eradicated, feudal morality has been shattered, and oppression and trampling of women based on money and power is no longer allowed by the people's laws. Women in New China, together with male workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals, stand up with their chests out. Isn't this the superiority of socialism? The new realistic significance of staging "Pan Jinlian" today must be taken into account.
    Speaking of Comrade Tian Han's "Death of a Famous Actor," this play is one that I have always loved to read. I had not seen it performed before. Before liberation, when I was in Kunming, one evening, I was chatting with Mr. Hong Shen in the small building of the New China Theater on Jinghong Street. He was a little drunk. Because the theater had just performed "Returning Home on a Snowy Night" not long ago, because it was also based on the tragic experience of artists in the old society, he spoke with emotion from association about his experience playing Liu Zhensheng in "Death of a Famous Actor." He recited the lines of "Death of a Famous Actor" vividly, with many gestures, and then said: "Elder Brother's play expresses the artist's grief and anger. It is not only sorrowful, but also indignant, so his spirit of resistance is even more fully expressed!"
    Comrade Tian Han said: "After watching several plays with the backstage of the old society as the background, the audience can clearly feel which era's backstage is 'full of vitality' and which era's backstage is 'full of murderous intent.'" Indeed, because right-wing elements have their hearts and eyes filled with feudal and capitalist toxins, they are "talking about the backstage" with ulterior motives to slander the new China's drama movement. The performance of this play is a powerful answer.
    Finally, I would also like to briefly talk about this performance. Naturally, in terms of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the spoken drama movement and in terms of the anti-rightist struggle, it is extremely commendable. Even from the performance itself, the younger generation should not be compared with the deep accomplishments of the older generation masters, but the pairing of the two plays is quite complete, and each actor has his own success in creating the role. This also shows that the Chinese spoken drama movement is advancing with the progress of society. Therefore, I not only recall the past, but also cannot help but congratulate today's performance.

### 怀旧与祝新——为“潘金莲”与“名优之死”上演而作

　　怀旧与祝新
　　——为“潘金莲”与“名优之死”上演而作
　　孟超
    北京人民艺术剧院为了话剧运动五十年纪念，演出了欧阳予倩、田汉两同志的“潘金莲”与“名优之死”，使我感到极为兴奋。因为自己的年龄比中国话剧的年龄多不了几岁，曾经亲眼看见过去的演出，或听见过参加过去演出的人津津乐道着当年的盛事，所以再看这次的演出，就觉得倍加亲切，引起了不少的回忆。
    “潘金莲”在“鱼龙会”上演出的时候，虽然中国话剧运动已经有快二十年的历史了，但它仍然标志着话剧工作者与进步的戏曲工作者共同的推动着新的戏剧运动，留下了不可磨灭的成就。当时欧阳老与周信芳的潘金莲与武松，同是以湛深的表演艺术，刻划出两个中心人物的思想感情，表达出热情奔放的时代精神。其他如高百岁、周五宝、唐槐秋、唐叔明，配搭的也都极为匀称。对此“人间难得几回闻”的名剧而引为幸事的观众之一的我，在那不大的剧场里，——事实上只是一个小饭厅——心里不时的被激动着，特别是最后一场，武松的坦率的心胸，潘金莲的泼辣辣的反抗的心情，如今已三十年了，舞台的影像还不时的在我脑子里回萦。
    欧阳予倩同志说：“我并没有想为潘金莲翻案，我只想起不合理的婚姻制度、封建道德的束缚，有钱有势的男人对女人的压迫蹂躏，可以造成罪恶的悲剧，我不过是想借潘金莲这一人物描绘一下这一矛盾罢了。”是的，妇女解放的口号，还是在资产阶级民主革命时代提出的；然而妇女真正得到解放，却是在社会主义社会才能实现。我们在短短的五十年间跃过了资本主义社会而飞速的进到社会主义社会，不合理婚姻制度压根儿铲除了，封建道德破灭了，依钱仗势压迫蹂躏妇女已不为人民法律所允许了，新中国的妇女与男性的工人农民进步的知识分子，一道挺着胸脯站起来了，难道这不是社会主义的优越性吗？今天上演“潘金莲”，这一新的现实的意义，就不能不估计进去。
    再说到田汉同志的“名优之死”，这一剧作是我一向所爱读的。我以前没有看见过演出，解放前我在昆明时，有一天晚上，和洪深先生在景虹街新中国剧社的小楼上闲谈，他带了几分薄醉，由于剧社刚演过“风雪夜归人”不久，因为同是以旧社会艺人生活的悲惨遭遇为题材的关系，他从联想中感慨的谈起了他饰演“名优之死”刘振声的情景；他历历不忘地念着“名优之死”的台词，还带了不少的动作，然后说道：“老大这剧，是抒发出艺术家悲愤的胸怀，不但是悲，而且是愤，因而他那反抗的精神更加充分！”
    田汉同志说：“看了几个以旧社会的后台做背景的戏，观众可以明确的感到到底哪一个时代的后台是‘生气勃勃’，哪一个时代的后台是‘杀气腾腾’。”的确，右派分子因为心里眼里充满着封建主义的、资本主义的毒素，别有用心的来“谈后台”，来诬蔑新中国的戏剧运动，这戏的演出，是作了有力的回答。
    最后，还想略谈一下这次的演出，自然在纪念话剧运动五十年的意义上，在反右派斗争的意义上，是极可称道的。即就演出本身来看，青年一代自然不应与前辈大师们的深厚的造诣并比，但两戏的配搭，却是相当的齐整，每一演员对于角色的创造，都各有其成功处。这也说明中国话剧运动正随着社会的前进而前进着。因此，我不但回忆过去的旧迹，更不能不为今天的演出祝贺。
