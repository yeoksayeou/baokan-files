　　保加利亚贵宾游故宫登景山
    据新华社15日讯  以于哥夫主席为首的保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团，今天上午在北京游览了故宫，并登上故宫后面的景山最高处的万春亭眺望北京城壮丽的景色。
    故宫博物院院长吴仲超向贵宾们详细地介绍了陈列出的中国历史文物和封建王国穷奢极欲的生活。贵宾们还参观了故宫中的国际友谊馆，那里陈列有保加利亚共产党中央委员会送给毛主席的格·季米特洛夫画册，以及许多友好国家送给中国的纪念品。于哥夫主席参观故宫后说：这些地方被保留下来对中国人民很有意义。我们从这里看到了中国人民的艺术和智慧，看到了中国民族的天才的努力的成果被封建统治者剥削得多么厉害。
    参观完毕后，吴仲超代表博物院送给于哥夫主席和代表团成员全套宋人画册和图片。贵宾们最后还在纪念册上题了字。
