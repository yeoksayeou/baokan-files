Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: Over two hundred central committee members from the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have engaged in a major debate on the issue of political stance at their joint meeting these past few days.

　　The reactionary nature of the capitalist stance is the central topic of this major debate. Beginning on September 12th, after four days of discussion, it has now reached its climax. Many committee members have expressed their opinions freely at the meeting. During breaks, everyone also spontaneously holds room-based group meetings for free-ranging discussions.

　　Committee members from Shandong and Jiangsu believe in their discussions that the same thing is viewed very differently due to differing political stances. For example, when it comes to the benefits of socialism, if you stand on the socialist stance, you can talk about them for three days and three nights without end. But if you stand on the capitalist stance, you only need the phrase "the present is not as good as the past" to smear the new society as completely dark. This is a matter of stance. Another example is the socialist transformation. From the working class's stance, it is only right for capitalists to hand over their enterprises to the working class. However, some capitalists regard handing over their enterprises as a "transaction," thinking that handing over an enterprise should bring "ten thousand profits from a single investment," and demanding fame, positions, and benefits from the government. Rightist Zhang Naiqi sees the bourgeoisie handing over enterprises as entering socialism "bearing gifts," even more "great" than the working class. All of these reflect the reactionary nature of the capitalist stance.

　　Committee members from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places cited the fact that some industrialists and businessmen in various places are demanding to withdraw from joint ventures, attempting to take the capitalist road backward, to confirm the destructive effect of adhering to the capitalist stance. According to investigations, in Shanghai alone, the number of underground screw factories has increased from twenty-four to two hundred and four in the past two to three months, and more than six hundred households have withdrawn from joint ventures.

　　During the discussion of the reactionary nature of the capitalist stance, someone raised the question: If the capitalist stance is reactionary, is capitalist ideology also reactionary? What is the relationship between ideology and stance? A small number of committee members in the Beijing group believe that the capitalist stance is reactionary, but it cannot be said that capitalist ideology is also reactionary, because even if a person has firmly established their stance, capitalist ideas often pop up. Zhang Yuanshan, Le Songsheng, Mo Yichang, Li Yizan, Chen Suiheng, Lu Qikang, and others unanimously believe that separating stance from ideology is illogical, and both the capitalist stance and capitalist ideology are reactionary.

　　As the debate on this issue gradually deepened, some committee members from the Shanghai and Jiangsu groups raised different views. They said that capitalist ideology cannot be said to be entirely reactionary, and should be treated differently and analyzed specifically. For example, capitalist ideology is reactionary on major issues of right and wrong, but not reactionary on minor issues. If all capitalist ideology is said to be reactionary, it will also be detrimental to the transformation of industrialists and businessmen. Tang Diin disagreed with this view, saying that capitalist ideology should be regarded as a germ, and it has a bad effect no matter how it erodes the human body. For example, if a person has lung disease, you cannot think that the first stage of lung disease is not serious and not treat it. By the time it develops to a serious level, it will be incurable. Therefore, she believes that capitalist ideology is reactionary no matter the degree. Attempting to legally retain a part of capitalist ideology is very detrimental to transformation. Zhang Jingli said: We should deeply abhor capitalist ideology. We shouldn't divide capitalist ideology into a reactionary part and a non-reactionary part. This is not beneficial to the ideological transformation of industrialists and businessmen.

　　The committee members also raised two questions. One is: Since both the capitalist stance and capitalist ideology are reactionary, why did Director Chen Shutong say in his report to the conference that "a reactionary capitalist stance does not mean that everyone who has not abandoned the capitalist stance today is reactionary"? The other is: Currently, people with capitalist ideology are very common. Is this proposal too shocking to the industrial and commercial circles? Qi Qisheng, Liu Jingji, and others all believe that raising the reactionary nature of capitalist ideology will indeed cause shock in industrial and commercial circles and among bourgeois intellectuals. They believe that this shock is of positive significance. They used their own experiences to illustrate that in this anti-rightist struggle, if the Party had not given a loud shout, shaking them up, they might have made even bigger mistakes. However, they all believe that people with capitalist ideology cannot all be said to be reactionary. Liu Jingji said that the bourgeoisie is currently divided into three factions: left, center, and right. Rightists adhere to the capitalist stance and are hostile to socialism, of course they are reactionaries; while middle-of-the-roaders have two sides to them. Although they have basically not abandoned the capitalist stance and still long for capitalism, they can accept the leadership of the Communist Party and are willing to take the socialist road. For such people, in some of the wrong things they do, they may be reactionary, but the person cannot be said to be reactionary.

　　The major debate meeting hosted by the conference's document drafting committee on the 15th evening brought the debate to a climax. More than two hundred people automatically requested to participate in the major debate, and they spoke extremely enthusiastically. Some requested to speak multiple times to explain their views. This atmosphere of free debate gradually formed during the conference. At the beginning, everyone felt shocked by the fact that Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out that the capitalist stance was reactionary in his speech on the rectification movement in industrial and commercial circles. However, many people had ideological concerns, and even mistakenly feared that expressing their opinions would be labeled as "rightists" by others, and were unwilling to express their opinions frankly. Some opinions were very obscure. After the conference presidium mobilized and enlightened them, and a group of committee members first opened up their thoughts, brewing and exchanging opinions with each other, the debate gradually unfolded. The debate is still ongoing.

　　资本主义思想是否反动？
　　民建工商联联席会进行大辩论
    据新华社17日讯　民主建国会和全国工商联的二百多位中央委员，这几天在两会联席会议上展开了一场关于政治立场问题的大辩论。
    资本主义立场的反动性，是这次大辩论的中心题目。自9月12日开始，经过四天的讨论，目前已进入高潮。许多委员在会上各抒己见，充分发言。在会议休息时，大家也自动举行房间小组会，自由漫谈。
    山东、江苏的委员们在讨论中，认为同一件事物，由于各人政治立场不同，看法也截然不同，如对于社会主义的好处，站在社会主义立场三天三夜也讲不完，站在资本主义立场，只用“今不如昔”一句话就把新社会诬蔑成为漆黑一团，这就是立场问题。再如社会主义改造，从工人阶级立场看，资本家把企业交还工人阶级，是理所当然的，但有些资本家却把交出企业当成一场“交易”，以为企业交出就应该“一本万利”，向政府要名、要位、要利；右派分子章乃器把资产阶级交出企业看作是“带着礼物”进入社会主义，比工人阶级还“伟大”，这些都反映了资本主义立场的反动性。
    来自上海、广州等地的委员列举各地部分工商业者要求退出合营企业，企图走资本主义回头路的事实，来证实坚持资本主义立场的破坏作用。据调查，仅上海一地，最近二、三个月地下螺丝钉厂已从二十四家发展到二百零四家，退出合营的有六百多户。
    在讨论资本主义立场的反动性时，有人提出：资本主义立场是反动的，资本主义思想是不是反动？它和立场的关系如何？北京小组有少数委员认为，资本主义立场是反动的，可是不能说资本主义思想也是反动的，因为一个人即使站稳了立场，也往往会冒出资本主义思想。章元善、乐松生、莫艺昌、李贻赞、陈邃衡、陆其康等一致认为，把立场和思想割裂开来是不合逻辑的，资本主义立场和资本主义思想都是反动的。
    当这一问题的辩论逐步深入后，上海、江苏小组有一部分委员又提出了不同看法，他们说，资本主义思想不能说全部是反动的，应该区别对待，具体分析。如在大是大非问题上有资本主义思想是反动的，而在小是小非问题上资本主义思想不是反动的，如果把所有资本主义思想都说是反动的，这对工商业者的改造也是不利的。汤蒂因不同意这种看法，她说，应该把资本主义思想当作病菌，侵蚀到人体都有坏作用。例如一个人生了肺病，你不能认为第一期肺病不严重就不去治疗，等到发展到严重的程度就不可救药了，因此她认为资本主义思想不管程度怎么样，都是反动的。企图合法地保留一部分资本主义思想，对改造是很不利的。张敬礼说：我们对资本主义思想应该深恶痛绝，不要在资本主义思想体系中，分出那一部分反动，那一部分不反动，这对工商业者的思想改造没有好处。
    委员们又提出两个问题，一个是：既然资本主义立场和资本主义思想都是反动的，为什么陈叔通主任委员在大会报告中说“资本主义立场反动，不等于说今天还没有抛弃资本主义立场的人都反动”？另一个是：目前具有资本主义思想的人是很普遍的，这样提出来是否对工商界震动太大了？漆琪生、刘靖基等人都认为提出资本主义思想的反动性，确会在工商界中以及资产阶级知识分子中引起震动，这种震动是有积极意义的。他们用亲身体会来说明在这次反右派斗争中，要不是党大喝一声，震动一下，自己也可能要犯更大的错误。但是他们都认为具有资本主义思想的人不能说都是反动的。刘靖基说，目前资产阶级中分为左中右三派，右派分子坚持资本主义立场，敌视社会主义，当然是反动派；而中间分子存在着两面性，他们虽然基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场，留恋资本主义；但他们能接受共产党领导，愿意走社会主义道路，这样的人，在他所做的某些错误事件上可能是反动的，但这个人不能说是反动的。
    15日晚上由大会文件起草委员会主持的大辩论会，把论战引向高潮，自动要求参加大辩论的有二百多人，发言极为踊跃。有的为了说明自己意见，多次要求发言。这种自由辩论的气氛，是在会议过程中逐步形成的。开始时，大家对中共中央统战部李维汉部长就工商界整风问题发表的谈话中指出资本主义立场是反动的，感到震动。但是不少人思想有顾虑，甚至错误地害怕发表意见会被别人扣上“右派”帽子，不愿坦率地表示意见，有的意见很隐晦。经过大会主席团动员、启发，并且有一部分委员首先敞开了自己的思想，相互酝酿、交流意见，辩论就逐步展开。目前辩论会还在继续进行。
