    Abundant Harvest of Shatien Pomelos
    The Guangxi Shatien pomelos, famous at home and abroad, have had an abundant harvest. It is estimated that the total output of Shatien pomelos in this province this year can reach more than 13 million jin, an increase of about 50% over last year.
    In Rongxian Special District, the main producing area of Shatien pomelos, this year, due to the agricultural cooperatives doing a better job in fertilizing and de-worming the pomelo trees, coupled with sufficient rainfall, each tree generally bears 50 to 60 fruits, and some as many as 200 to 300. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, farmers have already picked a batch of Shatien pomelos, preparing them for festive consumption and sending them to Nanning and other towns for sale.

    沙田柚大丰收
    闻名国内外的广西沙田柚大丰收。据估计，今年这个省沙田柚的总产量可以达到一千三百多万斤，比去年增加五成左右。
    沙田柚的主要产地容县专区，今年由于农业社对柚子树的施肥、除虫等工作做得较好，加上雨水充足，因而一般每株结果五、六十个，多的达二、三百个。中秋节前，农民已经采摘一批沙田柚，准备过节食用，并送南宁等城镇出售。（新华社）
