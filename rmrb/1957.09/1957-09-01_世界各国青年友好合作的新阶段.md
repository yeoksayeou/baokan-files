    The Chinese youth delegation, consisting of fifteen representatives, attended the Fourth World Federation of Democratic Youth Congress after the Youth Festival. The congress was held in Kyiv from August 16 to 23. The warm hospitality shown by the government and people of Ukraine and Kyiv in preparing for the congress left a deep impression on us.

    This was a victorious congress, a congress of unity. It will advance the cause of friendly cooperation among young people of all countries to a new stage. The central topic of this congress was how to further strive for peace and expand cooperation with youth organizations of various tendencies to achieve the great unity of world youth. The member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and some non-member organizations were very concerned about this issue. In addition to the 320 representatives from member organizations in 80 countries, 174 observers from 141 non-WFDY international and national organizations and 14 specially invited guests from 103 countries participated in the congress. The Youth Federation of Yugoslavia, the Youth Department of the Indian National Congress, the Japan Youth Organization Council, the All-Japan Federation of Youth and Women's Organizations, the Youth Department of the Japan Socialist Party, and youth organizations of socialist and radical parties from many Latin American countries sent observers to the congress. UN Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld and others also sent letters to congratulate the congress. The broader representation of this congress compared to previous sessions is inseparable from the efforts of the WFDY in recent years. Since the WFDY Executive Committee meeting in Warsaw in August 1955, the WFDY, with a spirit of responsibility to the vast number of young people, has reviewed its past work and implemented a policy of expanding contact and strengthening cooperation with other international and national youth organizations, which has greatly increased the possibility of international cooperation among youth organizations and enabled this congress to receive more organizational support.

    WFDY President Bruno Bernini delivered a general report to the congress on behalf of the Executive Committee, and Secretary-General Jacques Denis delivered a report on behalf of the Executive Committee on amending the charter, proposing a draft of the new charter. During the discussion, more than 90 representatives and observers from 80 countries spoke at the congress. After discussions in the congress, subcommittees, and off-site consultations, the congress adopted resolutions on the general report, appeals, and other resolutions, formulated a new charter, and elected a new Executive Committee.

    The current international situation was of concern to the congress. Many speeches and resolutions of the congress addressed the issues of opposing the threat of atomic war and opposing colonialism. We heard appeals from friends in Japan and the United Kingdom to stop nuclear weapons testing. We heard voices from youth representatives from European countries demanding disarmament and opposing the policy of atomic war preparations. We also heard the concerns of friends from Arab countries about the situation in West Asia and North Africa. The accusations of colonial enslavement by young people from Asian, African, and Latin American countries aroused our sympathy even more. Based on an analysis of the current situation, the congress pointed out that the danger of war still exists. The resolutions and appeals of the congress called on all youth organizations to take joint action to strive for an immediate cessation of testing and prohibition of thermonuclear weapons, strive for universal disarmament, ease international tensions, strive to eliminate the scourge of colonialism, and defend world peace. These all reflect the common aspirations of the vast number of young people.

    Striving for peace, democracy, national independence, and the progress of mankind has been the consistent political program of the WFDY. The experience of the WFDY over the past twelve years has proven the correctness of this political line. However, the path the WFDY has traveled has also raised the question of what kind of working line an international organization like the WFDY should adopt to realize its political program. In this regard, the WFDY has gained some experience in its past work. Therefore, when discussing how to further strive for peace and friendship, this congress focused on studying the WFDY's future working line. The Chinese youth delegation believes that the achievements made by the congress in this regard are conducive to international cooperation among youth organizations and further improvement of the WFDY's work.

    So, what are the characteristics of the new working line decided by the congress?

    First, the resolutions of this congress and the new charter emphasize the principle of cooperation. The new charter stipulates that "promoting international understanding and cooperation among all international and national organizations and the world's youth" is the basic task of the WFDY. The new charter also stipulates that in addition to initiating or holding international activities itself, the WFDY should also "support or jointly organize various activities with other organizations" and "sponsor or specifically help international, bilateral, and national activities and exchanges organized by national organizations." This policy was warmly supported by the participants of the congress. Many friends and our delegation emphasized in their speeches the importance of exchanges and contacts between youth organizations and individuals of various countries. These speeches pointed out that bilateral or multilateral activities between countries are of great significance for increasing understanding, eliminating estrangement and misunderstanding, and strengthening international cooperation, and that international organizations like the WFDY should support these activities. The purpose of such activities is not to impose one's will on others or interfere in their internal affairs, but to seek peace, seek friendship, and seek knowledge. This is because, regardless of size, every country has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we should learn from the strengths of others and overcome our own weaknesses; although the political tendencies of various youth organizations may not be exactly the same, they can all find a common language under the goals of peace and friendship. Conducting exchanges with this purpose can contribute to the friendly cooperation of young people from various countries.

    We believe that the decisions regarding the WFDY's organizational policy can be summarized into the following three principles: seeking common ground while reserving differences, treating each other as equals, and patient consultation.

    The so-called seeking common ground while reserving differences means uniting various youth organizations on common points and allowing them to retain their respective differences. This principle applies not only to the relationship between the WFDY and non-member organizations, but also to the relationship between member organizations and the relationship between member organizations and the WFDY. In order to achieve this, the new charter, in addition to continuing to state that the WFDY includes youth organizations of various political tendencies, religious beliefs, and forms of activity, also added some new provisions. For example, the original charter stipulated that only those who accept and abide by the WFDY charter, faithfully and consistently support democratic principles, and strive to realize these principles can become members. The new charter only stipulates that "all youth organizations or councils and organizations engaged in safeguarding the interests of youth and carrying out youth activities can become members of the WFDY." In addition, the new charter also established a new form of membership, namely the associate membership system, in order to absorb those organizations that only accept part of the WFDY charter and participate in some activities of the WFDY. These new provisions broaden the basis for membership and make it possible for more youth organizations to join the WFDY or establish contact with the WFDY. After joining, the new charter also allows various organizations to retain their own differences, such as stipulating that they can simultaneously participate in other organizations and that they do not have to implement WFDY resolutions if they disagree. We believe that these principles will enable the WFDY to achieve consensus on some major issues of common concern to young people from various countries, while allowing different opinions to be retained on ideological and secondary issues, thereby facilitating the expansion of international cooperation.

    The principles of treating each other as equals and mutual respect are also expressly stipulated in the new charter. The new charter emphasizes that the basis for the voluntary union of member organizations is "equality and mutual respect for autonomy," which was not included in the original charter. The original charter stipulated that the WFDY should "assist in the establishment of democratic youth organizations in regions where democratic youth organizations have not yet been established" and "spare no effort to promote free and voluntary cooperation and contact among youth organizations on a national scale," and these clauses have also been deleted in the new charter. Although, as some representatives said at the meeting, they did not find any instances of the WFDY hindering their autonomy in the past, the above-mentioned changes in the new charter can alleviate the concerns of more organizations and make them willing to cooperate with the WFDY. In addition, in order to ensure that member organizations have equal rights to participate in the WFDY's decision-making, the new charter changed the WFDY's leadership body to the congress of member organizations, stipulating that all member organizations have the right to send representatives to participate in discussions on the WFDY's policies and specific activities. Regarding the issue of member organizations' voting rights in the congress, this congress adopted the following method: each congress stipulates the distribution of votes for each country in the next congress, with the difference between the maximum number of votes and the minimum number of votes not exceeding one time; the distribution of votes obtained by each country among the various organizations in the country is negotiated by the country itself, and the congress of WFDY member organizations arbitrates when an agreement cannot be reached. This method is based on the principle of national equality while taking into account the particularities of various organizations. It ensures the substantial equality of member organizations in various countries within the WFDY's leadership structure. The above shows that the WFDY is striving to create conditions so that the opinions of all member organizations, regardless of size, can be respected. We believe that for an international organization like the WFDY, which includes large and small countries, includes organizations with more and fewer members, and has considerable strength and high prestige, it is very necessary to treat groups and individuals who are willing to contact and cooperate with the WFDY with a spirit of equality and respect for others.

    The new charter emphasizes the WFDY's liaison nature and cancels the provisions in the original charter that made the WFDY a more centralized organization. For example, the clauses in the original charter that members must abide by and strive to realize the resolutions of the WFDY Congress, Executive Council, and Executive Committee have been deleted in the new charter. The new charter stipulates that the Executive Committee and Bureau are only executive bodies, and members who disagree with the decisions of these bodies, or even the resolutions of the Congress of Member Organizations, can choose not to implement them. Under these new provisions, the WFDY can only adhere to the principle of patient consultation in handling its work in order to mobilize the majority of member organizations to realize common aspirations. Recent facts and the proceedings of this congress have proven this point. It should be said that there were not no differing opinions at this congress. For example, there were objections to the provision in the draft of the new charter regarding members being allowed to have dual membership; there were also many opinions on the draft of the Executive Committee list. However, after relatively full consultation, these issues were finally resolved with basic consensus, allowing the work of the congress to proceed relatively smoothly. Regarding the method of distributing voting rights among member organizations, there were three different proposals at the Executive Committee meeting in Berlin in February this year, so that it was not possible to write them into the draft charter. However, after several months of deliberation and consultation during this congress, a more reasonable solution was finally found. These facts all show that not adopting the principle of minority subordinating to the majority, that is, not forcing the opinions of the minority on the majority, nor forcing the opinions of the majority on the minority, but adhering to the spirit of patient consultation, is a more appropriate approach for international youth organizations to expand international cooperation at the present time.

    In addition to the above principles, we believe that the election results of the Executive Committee also represent a new trend. Many representatives requested that the Executive Committee have a reasonable regional distribution, especially to ensure appropriate proportions for Asian, African, and Latin American countries. This view was supported by the congress. To this end, the number of members of the Executive Committee was increased, and the election results showed that representatives of youth organizations from Asian, African, and Latin American countries accounted for more than one-half of the Executive Committee.

    Chinese youth are active participants in the struggle to defend world peace, oppose colonialism, and strive for human progress. We advocate developing exchanges between youth organizations and individuals of various countries, and we have consistently supported the activities of the WFDY. The Chinese youth delegation went to Kyiv to participate in the Fourth World Federation of Democratic Youth Congress precisely in this spirit. We agree with the various documents submitted by the Executive Committee to the congress, believing that these documents represent the aspirations of the vast number of young people, reflect the opinions of the majority of member organizations of the WFDY, and are conducive to world peace and international cooperation among youth organizations. At the same time, we also put forward our views on some specific issues and differences in our speeches at the congress, in subcommittee discussions, and especially in off-site consultations. Now, the congress has achieved results. We are satisfied with the various resolutions of the congress and the new charter. The All-China Youth Federation and other youth organizations in our country are determined to work hard to implement these resolutions. We call on the youth of the country to continue to promote the spirit of internationalism, pay more attention to various international activities to strive for world peace and human progress, pay attention to the struggles of youth friends from various countries, actively support the activities of the WFDY, and make new contributions to realizing the common good aspirations of young people from various countries.
