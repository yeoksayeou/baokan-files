    The Chinese youth delegation, consisting of fifteen representatives, attended the Fourth World Federation of Democratic Youth Congress after the Youth Festival. The congress was held in Kyiv from August 16 to 23. The warm hospitality shown by the government and people of Ukraine and Kyiv in preparing for the congress left a deep impression on us.

    This was a victorious congress, a congress of unity. It will advance the cause of friendly cooperation among young people of all countries to a new stage. The central topic of this congress was how to further strive for peace and expand cooperation with youth organizations of various tendencies to achieve the great unity of world youth. The member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and some non-member organizations were very concerned about this issue. In addition to the 320 representatives from member organizations in 80 countries, 174 observers from 141 non-WFDY international and national organizations and 14 specially invited guests from 103 countries participated in the congress. The Youth Federation of Yugoslavia, the Youth Department of the Indian National Congress, the Japan Youth Organization Council, the All-Japan Federation of Youth and Women's Organizations, the Youth Department of the Japan Socialist Party, and youth organizations of socialist and radical parties from many Latin American countries sent observers to the congress. UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and others also sent letters to congratulate the congress. The broader representation of this congress compared to previous sessions is inseparable from the efforts of the WFDY in recent years. Since the WFDY Executive Committee meeting in Warsaw in August 1955, the WFDY, with a spirit of responsibility to the vast number of young people, has reviewed its past work and implemented a policy of expanding contact and strengthening cooperation with other international and national youth organizations, which has greatly increased the possibility of international cooperation among youth organizations and enabled this congress to receive more organizational support.

    WFDY President Bruno Bernini delivered a general report to the congress on behalf of the Executive Committee, and Secretary-General Jacques Denis delivered a report on behalf of the Executive Committee on amending the charter, proposing a draft of the new charter. During the discussion, more than 90 representatives and observers from 80 countries spoke at the congress. After discussions in the congress, subcommittees, and off-site consultations, the congress adopted resolutions on the general report, appeals, and other resolutions, formulated a new charter, and elected a new Executive Committee.

    The current international situation was of concern to the congress. Many speeches and resolutions of the congress addressed the issues of opposing the threat of atomic war and opposing colonialism. We heard appeals from friends in Japan and the United Kingdom to stop nuclear weapons testing. We heard voices from youth representatives from European countries demanding disarmament and opposing the policy of atomic war preparations. We also heard the concerns of friends from Arab countries about the situation in West Asia and North Africa. The accusations of colonial enslavement by young people from Asian, African, and Latin American countries aroused our sympathy even more. Based on an analysis of the current situation, the congress pointed out that the danger of war still exists. The resolutions and appeals of the congress called on all youth organizations to take joint action to strive for an immediate cessation of testing and prohibition of thermonuclear weapons, strive for universal disarmament, ease international tensions, strive to eliminate the scourge of colonialism, and defend world peace. These all reflect the common aspirations of the vast number of young people.

    Striving for peace, democracy, national independence, and the progress of mankind has been the consistent political program of the WFDY. The experience of the WFDY over the past twelve years has proven the correctness of this political line. However, the path the WFDY has traveled has also raised the question of what kind of working line an international organization like the WFDY should adopt to realize its political program. In this regard, the WFDY has gained some experience in its past work. Therefore, when discussing how to further strive for peace and friendship, this congress focused on studying the WFDY's future working line. The Chinese youth delegation believes that the achievements made by the congress in this regard are conducive to international cooperation among youth organizations and further improvement of the WFDY's work.

    So, what are the characteristics of the new working line decided by the congress?

    First, the resolutions of this congress and the new charter emphasize the principle of cooperation. The new charter stipulates that "promoting international understanding and cooperation among all international and national organizations and the world's youth" is the basic task of the WFDY. The new charter also stipulates that in addition to initiating or holding international activities itself, the WFDY should also "support or jointly organize various activities with other organizations" and "sponsor or specifically help international, bilateral, and national activities and exchanges organized by national organizations." This policy was warmly supported by the participants of the congress. Many friends and our delegation emphasized in their speeches the importance of exchanges and contacts between youth organizations and individuals of various countries. These speeches pointed out that bilateral or multilateral activities between countries are of great significance for increasing understanding, eliminating estrangement and misunderstanding, and strengthening international cooperation, and that international organizations like the WFDY should support these activities. The purpose of such activities is not to impose one's will on others or interfere in their internal affairs, but to seek peace, seek friendship, and seek knowledge. This is because, regardless of size, every country has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we should learn from the strengths of others and overcome our own weaknesses; although the political tendencies of various youth organizations may not be exactly the same, they can all find a common language under the goals of peace and friendship. Conducting exchanges with this purpose can contribute to the friendly cooperation of young people from various countries.

    We believe that the decisions regarding the WFDY's organizational policy can be summarized into the following three principles: seeking common ground while reserving differences, treating each other as equals, and patient consultation.

    The so-called seeking common ground while reserving differences means uniting various youth organizations on common points and allowing them to retain their respective differences. This principle applies not only to the relationship between the WFDY and non-member organizations, but also to the relationship between member organizations and the relationship between member organizations and the WFDY. In order to achieve this, the new charter, in addition to continuing to state that the WFDY includes youth organizations of various political tendencies, religious beliefs, and forms of activity, also added some new provisions. For example, the original charter stipulated that only those who accept and abide by the WFDY charter, faithfully and consistently support democratic principles, and strive to realize these principles can become members. The new charter only stipulates that "all youth organizations or councils and organizations engaged in safeguarding the interests of youth and carrying out youth activities can become members of the WFDY." In addition, the new charter also established a new form of membership, namely the associate membership system, in order to absorb those organizations that only accept part of the WFDY charter and participate in some activities of the WFDY. These new provisions broaden the basis for membership and make it possible for more youth organizations to join the WFDY or establish contact with the WFDY. After joining, the new charter also allows various organizations to retain their own differences, such as stipulating that they can simultaneously participate in other organizations and that they do not have to implement WFDY resolutions if they disagree. We believe that these principles will enable the WFDY to achieve consensus on some major issues of common concern to young people from various countries, while allowing different opinions to be retained on ideological and secondary issues, thereby facilitating the expansion of international cooperation.

    The principles of treating each other as equals and mutual respect are also expressly stipulated in the new charter. The new charter emphasizes that the basis for the voluntary union of member organizations is "equality and mutual respect for autonomy," which was not included in the original charter. The original charter stipulated that the WFDY should "assist in the establishment of democratic youth organizations in regions where democratic youth organizations have not yet been established" and "spare no effort to promote free and voluntary cooperation and contact among youth organizations on a national scale," and these clauses have also been deleted in the new charter. Although, as some representatives said at the meeting, they did not find any instances of the WFDY hindering their autonomy in the past, the above-mentioned changes in the new charter can alleviate the concerns of more organizations and make them willing to cooperate with the WFDY. In addition, in order to ensure that member organizations have equal rights to participate in the WFDY's decision-making, the new charter changed the WFDY's leadership body to the congress of member organizations, stipulating that all member organizations have the right to send representatives to participate in discussions on the WFDY's policies and specific activities. Regarding the issue of member organizations' voting rights in the congress, this congress adopted the following method: each congress stipulates the distribution of votes for each country in the next congress, with the difference between the maximum number of votes and the minimum number of votes not exceeding one time; the distribution of votes obtained by each country among the various organizations in the country is negotiated by the country itself, and the congress of WFDY member organizations arbitrates when an agreement cannot be reached. This method is based on the principle of national equality while taking into account the particularities of various organizations. It ensures the substantial equality of member organizations in various countries within the WFDY's leadership structure. The above shows that the WFDY is striving to create conditions so that the opinions of all member organizations, regardless of size, can be respected. We believe that for an international organization like the WFDY, which includes large and small countries, includes organizations with more and fewer members, and has considerable strength and high prestige, it is very necessary to treat groups and individuals who are willing to contact and cooperate with the WFDY with a spirit of equality and respect for others.

    The new charter emphasizes the WFDY's liaison nature and cancels the provisions in the original charter that made the WFDY a more centralized organization. For example, the clauses in the original charter that members must abide by and strive to realize the resolutions of the WFDY Congress, Executive Council, and Executive Committee have been deleted in the new charter. The new charter stipulates that the Executive Committee and Bureau are only executive bodies, and members who disagree with the decisions of these bodies, or even the resolutions of the Congress of Member Organizations, can choose not to implement them. Under these new provisions, the WFDY can only adhere to the principle of patient consultation in handling its work in order to mobilize the majority of member organizations to realize common aspirations. Recent facts and the proceedings of this congress have proven this point. It should be said that there were not no differing opinions at this congress. For example, there were objections to the provision in the draft of the new charter regarding members being allowed to have dual membership; there were also many opinions on the draft of the Executive Committee list. However, after relatively full consultation, these issues were finally resolved with basic consensus, allowing the work of the congress to proceed relatively smoothly. Regarding the method of distributing voting rights among member organizations, there were three different proposals at the Executive Committee meeting in Berlin in February this year, so that it was not possible to write them into the draft charter. However, after several months of deliberation and consultation during this congress, a more reasonable solution was finally found. These facts all show that not adopting the principle of minority subordinating to the majority, that is, not forcing the opinions of the minority on the majority, nor forcing the opinions of the majority on the minority, but adhering to the spirit of patient consultation, is a more appropriate approach for international youth organizations to expand international cooperation at the present time.

    In addition to the above principles, we believe that the election results of the Executive Committee also represent a new trend. Many representatives requested that the Executive Committee have a reasonable regional distribution, especially to ensure appropriate proportions for Asian, African, and Latin American countries. This view was supported by the congress. To this end, the number of members of the Executive Committee was increased, and the election results showed that representatives of youth organizations from Asian, African, and Latin American countries accounted for more than one-half of the Executive Committee.

    Chinese youth are active participants in the struggle to defend world peace, oppose colonialism, and strive for human progress. We advocate developing exchanges between youth organizations and individuals of various countries, and we have consistently supported the activities of the WFDY. The Chinese youth delegation went to Kyiv to participate in the Fourth World Federation of Democratic Youth Congress precisely in this spirit. We agree with the various documents submitted by the Executive Committee to the congress, believing that these documents represent the aspirations of the vast number of young people, reflect the opinions of the majority of member organizations of the WFDY, and are conducive to world peace and international cooperation among youth organizations. At the same time, we also put forward our views on some specific issues and differences in our speeches at the congress, in subcommittee discussions, and especially in off-site consultations. Now, the congress has achieved results. We are satisfied with the various resolutions of the congress and the new charter. The All-China Youth Federation and other youth organizations in our country are determined to work hard to implement these resolutions. We call on the youth of the country to continue to promote the spirit of internationalism, pay more attention to various international activities to strive for world peace and human progress, pay attention to the struggles of youth friends from various countries, actively support the activities of the WFDY, and make new contributions to realizing the common good aspirations of young people from various countries.

    世界各国青年友好合作的新阶段
    出席世青第四届代表大会的中国青年代表团团长  胡耀邦
    由十五位代表组成的中国青年代表团，在联欢节之后出席了世界民主青年联盟第四届代表大会。大会是在8月16日至23日在基辅举行的。乌克兰以及基辅的政府和人民为准备大会所表现的热情好客精神，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    这是一次胜利的大会，团结的大会。它将把世界各国青年友好合作的事业推进到新阶段。本届大会的中心议题，是如何进一步争取和平，扩大同各种不同倾向青年组织的合作，以实现世界青年大团结的问题。世界民主青年联盟的各国会员组织以及一些非会员组织对这个问题都很关心。参加本届大会的，除了来自八十个国家会员组织的三百二十位代表外，还有一百四十一个非世青会员的国际性和全国性组织的一百七十四位观察员以及十四位特邀来宾，他们一共来自一百零三个国家。南斯拉夫人民青年联盟、印度国大党青年部、日本青年团协议会、全日青妇、日本社会党青年部，以及拉丁美洲许多国家社会党及激进党青年组织，都派有观察员列席大会。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德等也致函向大会祝贺。本届大会能够有比历届都要广泛的代表性，是同世界民主青年联盟（以下简称世青）近年来的努力分不开的。1955年8月世青理事会华沙会议以来，世青以对广大青年负责的精神检查了过去的工作，实行同其他国际性和全国性青年组织扩大接触加强合作的政策，都使青年组织国际合作的可能性大大增加，并使本届大会获得了更多组织的支持。
    世青主席布伦诺·柏尼尼代表执委会向大会作了总报告，总书记雅克·德尼代表执委会作了修改章程的报告，提出了新章程草案。在讨论中，共有八十个国家的九十多位代表和观察员在大会上发言。经过大会、小组委员会的讨论和会外协商以后，大会通过了关于总报告的决议、呼吁书以及其他决议，制订了新的章程，选举了新的执行委员会。
    当前的国际局势受到大会的关心。许多发言和大会的决议，都谈到了反对原子战争威胁和反对殖民主义问题。我们听到了日本、英国的朋友关于停止核武器试验的呼吁。我们听到了欧洲国家青年代表要求裁减军备反对原子备战政策的声音。我们也听到了阿拉伯国家朋友们对于西亚北非局势的忧虑。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家青年对于殖民奴役的控诉，更引起了我们的同情。大会根据对当前局势的分析，指出战争的危险仍然存在。大会的决议和呼吁书号召所有青年组织采取联合行动，争取立即停止试验和禁止热核子武器，争取普遍裁军，缓和国际局势，努力消除殖民主义祸害，保卫世界和平。这些，都反映了广大青年的共同愿望。
    争取和平、民主、民族独立和人类的进步，是世青一贯的政治纲领。世青成立十二年来的经验证明了这个政治路线的正确。但是，世青所走过的道路也向它提出了这样一个问题，这就是，像世青这样一个国际组织，应当采取怎样的工作路线来实现自己的政治纲领呢？在这方面，世青在过去的工作中取得了一些经验。因此，本届大会在讨论如何进一步争取和平和友谊的时候，着重研究了世青今后的工作路线。中国青年代表团认为大会在这方面所取得的成果，是有利于青年组织的国际合作和进一步改善世青的工作的。
    那末，大会所决定的新的工作路线究竟有那些特点呢？
    首先，本届大会的决议和新章程强调了合作原则。新章程把“促进一切国际与各国组织及世界青年的国际谅解与合作”，规定为世青的基本任务。新章程并且规定世青除倡议举行或自己举行国际活动以外，还应“支持其他组织或与之联合举办各项活动”，“赞助或具体帮助各国组织举办的国际的、双边的及一国范围内的活动及交往”。这个方针，受到大会参加者的热烈拥护。许多朋友及我国代表团在发言中都强调了各国青年组织及个人之间交往和接触的重要性。这些发言指出，各国之间的双边活动或多边活动，对于增加了解，消除隔膜和误会，加强国际合作有很大的意义，像世青这样的国际组织应当支持这些活动。这种活动的目的，不是为了把自己的意志强加于人或者干涉人家的内部事务，而是为了寻求和平，寻求友谊和寻求知识。这是因为，国家无论大小，都有它自己的长处或短处，我们应当学习别人的长处，克服自己的短处；各个青年组织的政治倾向虽然不尽相同，但都可以在和平友谊的目标下找到共同的语言。本着这个目的进行来往，就可以对各国青年的友好合作作出贡献。
    关于世青组织方针的决定，我们认为可以归纳为以下三个原则，这就是：求同存异，平等相处和耐心协商。
    所谓求同存异，就是使各个青年组织在共同点上联合起来，允许保留各自的不同点。这个原则不仅适用于世青同非会员组织的关系，而且适用于会员组织之间以及会员组织同世青的关系。为了作到这一点，新章程除了继续说明世青包括各国不同政治倾向、宗教信仰和活动形式的青年组织之外，还增加了一些新的规定。例如，原来的章程规定必须接受和遵守世青章程，忠实地和一贯地支持民主原则并努力实现这些原则的，才能入会。而新章程只规定“一切青年组织或理事会以及从事维护青年利益、进行青年活动的组织，都可以成为世青会员”。除此之外，新章程还建立了一种新的入会形式，即联系会员制度，以便吸收那些只接受世青章程一部分内容，参加世青某一些活动的组织。这些新规定，扩大了会员入会的基础，有可能使更多的青年组织参加世青或同世青建立联系。而在入会以后，新章程也容许各个组织保留自己的不同点，如规定同时可参加其他组织，世青的决议如不同意可不执行等。我们相信，这些原则将可以促使世青在各国青年所共同关心的一些重大问题上求得一致，而对意识形态上和次要问题上的分歧允许保留不同意见，从而有利于扩大国际合作。
    平等相处和互相尊重的原则，也在新章程中有明文规定。新章程强调了会员组织自愿联合的基础是“平等及互相尊重自主权”，这是原章程没有的。原章程中规定世青应“协助尚未建立民主青年组织的地区成立民主青年组织”以及“不遗余力地推动各青年组织在全国规模上进行自由自愿的合作与联系”等条文，在新章程中也已删去。虽然，像某些代表在会上说的，他们并没有发现世青过去有妨碍他们自主权的事例；但是新章程的上述改变，就可以使更多组织解除顾虑，愿意同世青合作。此外，为了保证会员组织有平等权利参加世青的决策，新章程将世青的领导机关改为会员组织大会，规定所有会员组织都有权派代表参加，讨论世青的方针政策及具体活动。关于会员组织在大会中的投票权问题，本届大会采纳了这样的办法，即：每届大会规定下一届大会各国票数分配，最多票数和最少票数相差不超过一倍；每国所得票数在国内各组织间的分配由各该国自己协商，不能取得协议时由世青会员组织大会仲裁。这个办法是建立在国家平等的原则之上，而又照顾各个组织的特殊性的。它保证了各国会员组织在世青领导机构内实质上的平等。以上这些，说明世青在努力创造条件使各会员组织不论大小其意见均能受到尊重。我们认为，对于世青这样一个包括大国和小国，包括会员较多和会员较少的组织，并具有相当强大力量和很高威信的国际组织来说，以平等和尊重别人的精神去对待那些愿意同世青接触和合作的团体和个人，是十分必要的。
    新章程强调了世青的联络性质，取消了原章程中那些使世青成为较为集中的组织的规定。如会员必须遵守和努力实现世青代表大会、理事会、执委会的决议等条文，新章程中都已删去。新章程规定执委会和局都只是执行机构，对于这些机构的决定，甚至会员组织大会的决议，会员组织如不同意都可以不执行。在这些新规定之下，世青只有坚持耐心协商的原则来处理工作，才能动员大多数会员组织来实现共同的愿望。近年来的事实和本届大会的经过都证明了这一点。应当说，本届大会中不是没有不同意见的。例如，新章程草案中关于会员可以有双重会籍的规定，就曾经有过异议；对执委会名单草案也有过不少意见。但是，经过比较充分的协商，这些问题终于取得基本上的一致，使大会的工作能够比较顺利地进行。关于会员组织投票权的分配办法，今年2月柏林执委会会议上曾经有过三种不同方案，以致没有能够写进章程草案中去。但是经过几个月的酝酿和本届大会期间的协商，终于找到了一个比较合理的解决方案。这些事实都说明，不采取少数服从多数的原则，即少数人的意见不强使多数人接受，多数人的意见也不强使少数人接受，而坚持耐心协商的精神，是当前国际青年组织扩大国际合作比较恰当的作法。
    除了上面这些原则之外，我们认为执委会的选举结果也是一种新的趋向。许多代表要求执委会应有合理的地区分配，特别是保证亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家的适当比例。这种意见得到大会的支持。为此增加了执委会的名额，选举的结果是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家青年组织的代表在执委会中占了二分之一以上。
    中国青年是保卫世界和平、反对殖民主义和争取人类进步的斗争的积极参加者。我们主张发展各国青年组织和个人之间的来往，也一贯支持世青的活动。中国青年代表团正是本着这种精神到基辅去参加世青第四届代表大会的。我们同意执委会向大会提出的各项文件，认为这些文件代表了广大青年的愿望，反映了世青大多数会员组织的意见，有利于世界和平和青年组织的国际合作。同时，我们在大会发言、小组委员会讨论特别是会外协商中，也对一些具体问题和分歧意见提出了我们的看法。现在，大会已经取得了结果。我们对于大会的各项决议以及新章程是满意的。中华全国民主青年联合会及我国其他青年组织决心努力实现这些决议。我们号召全国青年继续发扬国际主义精神，更加关心争取世界和平和人类进步的各种国际活动，关心各国青年朋友的斗争，积极支持世青的活动，为实现各国青年共同的美好愿望作出新的贡献。
