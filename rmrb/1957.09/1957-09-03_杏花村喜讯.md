    Good News from Xinghua Village
    (Our report) The world-renowned Xinghua Village Fenjiu Distillery has started construction on its expansion.
    Xinghua Village is located in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province. Speaking of Xinghua Village's wine, people will recall the poem "May I ask where there is a tavern? A shepherd boy points to Xinghua Village." The Xinghua Village Fenjiu Distillery was built during the Northern and Southern Dynasties period (550 AD) and has a history of more than 1,400 years. Fenjiu is one of China's four famous liquors.
    Before liberation, the Xinghua Village Distillery was devastated by the Chiang and Yan bandit gangs and ceased production in 1947. Production was only restored after the liberation of Jinzhong in June 1948. At that time, the output was very low, producing about 20 kilograms of wine per day. In recent years, the production of the Xinghua Village Distillery has greatly developed. Now, the daily output has reached more than 3,700 kilograms. However, it still cannot meet the needs of the foreign market and the broad masses of the people at home.
    The state has allocated more than 2.7 million yuan for the expansion of the Xinghua Village Fenjiu Distillery. The ten major projects planned for construction this year, including the brewing workshop, fermentation room, wine cellar, blending room, and water tower, all officially started in August and will be put into production separately by the end of next year. It is estimated that the entire expansion project will be completed in 1959, and by 1960 the output of Fenjiu and Zhuyeqing will increase from the current annual output of more than 800 tons to an annual output of more than 2,800 tons.

    杏花村喜讯
    本报讯  世界驰名的杏花村汾酒厂开始动工扩建。
    杏花村在山西省的汾阳县。说起杏花村的酒，人们会记起“借问酒家何处有，牧童遥指杏花村”的诗句。杏花村汾酒厂建于南北朝时代（公元550年）已经有一千四百多年的历史。汾酒为我国四大名酒之一。
    解放以前，杏花村酒厂在蒋、阎匪帮的摧残下，曾于1947年停产，到1948年6月晋中解放以后才恢复生产。当时产量很低，每日约产酒二十公斤左右。几年来，杏花村酒厂的生产有了很大的发展。现在，日产量已达三千七百多公斤。但是仍然不能满足国外市场和国内广大人民的需要。
    国家扩建杏花村汾酒厂的拨款有二百七十多万元。今年计划施工的酿造厂、发酵室、酒库、配制房、水塔等十项主要工程，都已在8月份正式开工，明年年底即可分别投入生产。预计1959年全部扩建工程可以完工，1960年汾酒和竹叶青的产量将由现在的年产八百多吨提高到年产二千八百多吨。      （黄德淑）
