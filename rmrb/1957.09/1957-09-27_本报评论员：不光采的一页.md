    An Unsavory Page
    On September 24th, the United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by the United States, rejected the suggestion to include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations organization on the agenda. Thus, the United Nations General Assembly has added another unsavory page to its record.
    Since 1950, the United States has manipulated the voting machine it controls at every session of the United Nations General Assembly, doing everything possible to prevent the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. This method of the United States, which deliberately paralyzes the United Nations on major issues, undermines international cooperation, and creates tension, has been resented and opposed by more and more countries in the world. At the 1955 United Nations General Assembly, twelve countries supported discussing the issue of China's representation. At the 1956 United Nations General Assembly, the number of countries supporting the discussion of this issue increased to twenty-four. This year, at the United Nations General Assembly, twenty-seven countries favored discussing the issue of China's representation, three more than last year. The changes in the voting situation on the issue of China's representation in the United Nations General Assembly clearly show that the policy of the US ruling group hostile to the Chinese people is becoming increasingly unpopular.
    Indian representative Menon correctly pointed out at the United Nations General Assembly that even the United States itself has long admitted that the Chiang Kai-shek clique has lost the support of the people. Only by restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations can the United Nations General Assembly hear the voice of the real Chinese people. India is a large country in Asia and has always taken a positive interest in maintaining peace in Asia and the world and easing international tensions. The Indian representative's repeated raising of the issue of China's representation at the United Nations General Assembly is also to promote the solution of major international issues, which is conducive to peace and security in Asia and the world. This is a concrete manifestation of India's peaceful foreign policy. Therefore, India's proposal has been supported by peace-loving socialist countries, many Asian and African countries, and Northern European countries. Indian representative Menon's speech at the United Nations General Assembly won a round of applause, which was an irony and a blow to the United States.
    However, the US ruling group still insists on its policy of hostility to the Chinese people and obstruction of the relaxation of the international situation. The United States mainly relied on Latin American countries and countries participating in the various military groups planned by the United States to achieve its goals.
    It is worth noting that in this session of the United Nations General Assembly, Britain continued to follow the United States and support the United States' reactionary policy of hostility to the Chinese people. Britain is a country that has established diplomatic relations with our country, but it has repeatedly opposed having the representatives of the only legitimate government of China, the People's Republic of China, in the United Nations, and believes that it can continue to tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek clique occupying China's seat in the United Nations. This attitude of the British government cannot but arouse surprise and dissatisfaction among the Chinese people.
    However, the status and role of the People's Republic of China in world affairs is not determined by the United States or the United Nations controlled by the United States. The United States' manipulation of the United Nations to obstruct our country's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations cannot have any impact on our country, but can only imprint a mark of contempt on the United States and its followers and the United Nations itself.

    不光采的一页
    9月24日，联合国大会全体会议在美国操纵下，拒绝了把中国在联合国组织中的代表权问题列入议程的建议。这样，联合国大会就在它的记录上又增加了不光采的一页。
    从1950年以来，美国在每一届联合国大会上都操纵它所控制的表决机器，竭力阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。美国这种蓄意使联合国在重大问题上处于瘫痪状态、破坏国际合作、制造紧张局势的手段，已经遭到了世界上越来越多的国家的憎恶和反对。在1955年联合国大会上，支持讨论中国代表权问题的有十二个国家。1956年联合国大会上支持讨论这个问题的增加到了二十四个国家。今年联合国大会上有二十七个国家赞成讨论中国代表权问题，比去年又增加了三个。联合国大会在中国代表权问题上的投票情况的变化，清楚地说明美国统治集团敌视中国人民的政策正在越来越不得人心。
    印度代表梅农在联合国大会上正确地指出，连美国自己也早就承认蒋介石集团已经失去了人民的支持。只有恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，联合国大会才能听到真正中国人民的声音。印度是亚洲的大国，对于维护亚洲和世界的和平、和缓国际紧张局势，一向抱着积极关心的态度。印度代表在联合国大会上一再提出中国代表权问题，也就是为了促进各项重大国际问题的解决，以利于亚洲和世界的和平和安全。这是印度所奉行的和平外交政策的具体表现。因此，印度的建议得到了爱好和平的社会主义国家、许多亚非国家和北欧国家的支持。印度代表梅农在联合国大会上的发言，博得了一片掌声，这是对于美国的讽刺和打击。
    但是美国统治集团却仍然坚持它的敌视中国人民、阻挠国际局势缓和的政策。美国主要依靠着拉丁美洲国家和参加美国所策划的各个军事集团的国家，才达到了自己的目的。
    值得注意的是，在这届联合国大会上，英国仍继续追随美国，支持美国这个敌视中国人民的反动政策。英国是同我国建立了外交关系的国家，却竟然一而再地反对在联合国中有中国唯一合法的中华人民共和国政府的代表，竟然认为可以继续容忍让蒋介石集团窃据中国在联合国中的席位。英国政府这种态度，不能不引起中国人民的惊异和不满。
    然而，中华人民共和国在世界事务中的地位和作用，并不是由美国或者由美国控制的联合国来决定的。美国操纵联合国阻挠我国恢复联合国中的合法席位，并不能对我国发生任何影响，而只能给美国及其追随者和联合国本身印上受人鄙视的烙印。
