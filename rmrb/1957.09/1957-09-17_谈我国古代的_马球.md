　　On the Ancient Chinese "Polo"
　　Wu Wenzhi
    The "People's Daily" on the eighth page published an article "Random Talk on Ancient Chinese Football," which mentioned the ancient Chinese "polo." Here, I would like to talk about it based on the materials I have seen in ancient books.
    "Polo" is a kind of ball game played on horseback, which was introduced from the northern ethnic minorities in ancient times. The names in ancient books vary, sometimes called "击鞠" (jiju), sometimes called "击球" (jiqiu), or "打球" (daqiu), but they all mean the same thing. The "polo" ball is about the size of a modern rice bowl, made of soft cooked leather, tightly filled with soft material, and has some elasticity when thrown on the ground. The way to play this ball is: the players ride on horses, the horses gallop in the field, and the players hit the ball with sticks on horseback, showing the skills of hitting the ball. "The faster the horse runs, the more accurate the hit, the more skilled it is called" ("Tang Yulin" Volume 5). During the ball game, the participants compete with each other on horseback to hit the ball, and the winner is determined by the number of times the ball is hit. The number of participants can be as few as two and as many as dozens.
    The trend of playing "polo" was once very popular in the Tang Dynasty. From the emperor and nobles to the common people, almost everyone could play. And the leisure class, because they had money, played on a grander scale and with more variety. They specially built polo fields for playing "polo," which were very particular. According to "Sui Tang Jia Hua," at that time, there was already "oil sprinkled on the ground to build a polo field," just like today's asphalt roads. This kind of polo field also existed in the palace. Emperor Jingzong Li Zhan of the Tang Dynasty once "击鞠 (jiju) in the Zhonghe Hall on Dingwei Day and 击鞠 (jiju) in the Feilongyuan on Wushen Day" ("Tang Shu" Volume 8 "Benji"). Emperor Xuanzong Li Chen's polo skills were considered very high at the time. "Tang Yulin" Volume 7 said: "Emperor Xuanzong's archery and polo skills were all exquisite. The horse he rode, apart from the bridle, was not decorated, but the horse was particularly agile. Every time he held the polo stick, he took advantage of the momentum to leap and volley, hitting the ball in the air hundreds of times, and the horse kept running, as fast as lightning. The veterans of the three armies all admired his ability."
      "Polo's" style was very charming in the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Xuanzong Li Longji always liked to enjoy it after finishing his court affairs; Emperor Gaozu's son Yuanji was even more addicted to "polo." He once told people that he would rather not eat for three days than not "击球 (jiqiu)" for one day. He could really be regarded as a "polo fan." In the palace at that time, there was also a group of female performers who specialized in performing "polo." When they performed "polo," not only the people and horses had to be carefully decorated, but also there was a large orchestra to harmonize with the music. Each performance cost tens of thousands of dollars ("Tang Shu" Volume 133 "Guo Yingyi Biography").
    Because the emperors of the Tang Dynasty had a special fondness for this kind of "polo," the courtiers and ordinary scholars in the palace also catered to the rulers' psychology and learned this ball game. Later, the rulers even regarded the skill of playing "polo" as a criterion for obtaining official positions. "Taiping Guangji" Volume 289 "Demonstration" 2 "Chen Pushe Article" has such a record: "Chen Jingxuan, Yang Shili, Niu Xu, and Luo Yuangao competed for the three Chuan (east, west, and central Sichuan) by playing ball. Jingxuan won the first prize and was appointed as the Jiedushi of Right Shu, replacing Cui Gong (Anqian), which shocked both inside and outside the court." Chen Jingxuan became the Jiedushi of Xichuan because of his excellent ball skills! "Polo" developed to this point, obviously, it was the rulers who took pleasure in it, but the scholars used it to gain official positions. Because of this reason, the Jinshi of the Tang Dynasty had an organization called "打球会 (daqiu hui)" (polo club). "Tang Zhi Yan" Volume 3 has a wonderful description of the "打球会 (daqiu hui)" practicing and competing, writing that the competition between the new Jinshi Liu Qin and the number one scholar won the cheers of thousands of spectators.
    The "polo," which was very popular in ancient times, has been lost for a long time. Although this activity once produced various malpractices in ancient times, it seems that the activity itself may still be beneficial to exercise people's courage, agility, and wit.

### 谈我国古代的“马球”

　　谈我国古代的“马球”
　　吴文治
    “人民日报”第八版上登过一篇“漫话我国古代足球”的文章里边曾提到我国古代的“马球”。这里，我想根据平时在古书上所见到的这方面材料来谈谈。
    “马球”，这是一种骑在马上玩的球艺，它是古时从北方少数民族那里传来的。古书所称名目不一，或称“击鞠”，或称“击球”，或称“打球”，其实都是一个意思。“马球”的球如现在的饭碗大小，用柔软的熟皮做成，里边紧塞软的东西，掷在地上有些弹性。这种球的玩法是：玩球的人骑在马上，马在球场里驰骋，玩球的人在马上以棍棒击球，表演击球的技艺。“马奔愈速，击愈命中，始称高手”（“唐语林”卷五）。赛球时，参加赛球的人，双方都骑在马上互相争逐击球，以击中球的次数的多少，评分胜负。参加比赛的人数，少的可以两人，多的可以多至数十人。
    玩“马球”的风气，在唐代是曾经盛极一时的。上自皇帝贵族，下至平民百姓，几乎都会得玩。而有闲阶级因为有钱，玩的排场就更大，花样也更多。他们为了玩“马球”，特意修筑球场，非常讲究。据“隋唐嘉话”记载，当时就已经有以“油洒地以筑球场”，就像今天的柏油马路一样。这种球场，在宫中也有，唐敬宗李湛就曾经于“丁未击鞠于中和殿，戊申击鞠于飞龙院”（“唐书”卷八“本纪”）。宣宗李忱的球艺，在当时算是很高的，“唐语林”卷七说：“宣宗弧矢击鞠，皆尽其妙。所御马，衔勒之外，不加雕饰，而马尤矫捷，每持鞠（球）杖，乘势奔跃，运鞠于空中，连击至数百，而马驰不止，迅若流电。三军老手，咸服其能。”
      “马球”的球风在唐代是很迷人的，玄宗李隆基在上朝完毕之后总喜欢以此取乐；高祖的儿子元吉，沉溺于“马球”就更加厉害，他曾经跟人说，他宁可三日不食，却不可一日不“击球”，他真够得上算是个“球迷”。在当时的宫庭里，还养了一批专门表演“马球”的女伎，她们在表演“马球”的时候，不仅人和马都要细细装饰，而且还有很大的乐队以乐调相和。每一次表演，所花费的钱，常以万计（“唐书”卷一三三“郭英义传”）。
    由于唐代的帝王对这种“马球”有着特别的喜好，所以当时宫中的侍臣和一般的读书人，也都迎合着统治者的心理，学习这种球艺。到后来，统治者甚至把这种玩“马球”的技艺，也当作了取官的一个标准。“太平广记”卷二八九“妖妄”二“陈仆射条”就有这样的记载：“陈敬瑄与杨师立、牛勖、罗元杲以打球争三川（四川之东、西、中三部），敬瑄获头筹，制授右蜀节度，以代崔公（安潜），中外惊骇。”陈敬瑄因为球艺精良，竟做了西川节度使！“马球”发展到这地步，显然是统治者以此取乐，士人却以此得官了。正因为这个缘故，所以唐代的科举进士就有了“打球会”的组织。“唐摭言”卷三就有一段“打球会”练习比赛的精采描写，写新进士刘覃和状元的比赛博得了几千观众的喝采。
    在古代盛极一时的“马球”，失传已经很久了。这种活动，虽然在古代曾经产生过种种弊端，但是现在看来，这种活动的本身，对于锻炼人的勇敢、敏捷和机智，恐怕还是会有好处的。
