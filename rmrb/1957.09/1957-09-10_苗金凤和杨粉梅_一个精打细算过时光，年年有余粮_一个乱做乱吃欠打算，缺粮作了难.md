    Miao Jinfeng and Yang Fenmei
    One manages time frugally, with surplus grain every year; one cooks and eats carelessly without planning, facing difficulty due to grain shortage
    By Our Correspondent Pei Guoxun
    As soon as you arrive at the Hongyaitou Agricultural Cooperative in Wangjing Township, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, the cooperative members will tell you: Miao Jinfeng is an expert in saving grain.
    Miao Jinfeng's family has a total of five people (a child just five months old is not included). Last autumn, she received 2,003 jin of grain from labor distribution in the cooperative. Adding the surplus grain from the previous year and the more than 400 jin of grain from a cadre who regularly ate at her home, the total was more than 2,600 jin. Calculating based on six people, each person had an average of more than 430 jin of grain.
    Although Miao Jinfeng's family has so much grain, she never wastes a single grain arbitrarily. Instead, she calculates carefully, striving to have a grain surplus every year to prepare for lean years. To achieve this goal, she starts saving grain as soon as the grain is distributed. Her family's regular grain consumption plan is as follows: during the slack season, they make porridge with three he of mixed rice and coarse noodle lumps with two sheng of millet for breakfast; for lunch, they make "mixed rice" with seven he of rice, two and a half he of beans, and wheat flour, plus stir-fried flour with half a sheng of grain; in the evening, they heat up the leftover lunch and add stir-fried flour with two and a half he of grain. During the busy farming season, they add nine he of rice for lunch and reduce the stir-fried flour by half a sheng, changing the "mixed rice" to "drained rice." Generally, they eat "drained rice" for lunch for one-third of the year and "mixed rice" for two-thirds of the year. According to this calculation, the whole family only needs more than 2,100 jin of grain for the whole year (an average of more than 362 jin per person), leaving a surplus of more than 500 jin of grain. If you exclude the grain consumed for improving living standards during the New Year and festivals, there will still be a surplus of at least 200 jin.
    Zhang Sihuo, from the same cooperative, received a total of 1,586 jin of grain last autumn, for three people, an average of 529 jin per person. However, by the beginning of July, they had eaten it all and had to ask the state for a supply (150 jin of grain were supplied in early July, and it was eaten up again by mid-August). Why is this? Because his wife, Yang Fenmei, usually lacks careful planning in grain consumption. Often, after the millet is harvested, it is ground into rice, and they eat either drained rice, steamed rice, or "Ernan porridge" (meaning rice that is neither dry nor watery); after the wheat is harvested, they eat either noodles, sliced noodles, or pancakes; the amount of food cooked for each meal is often inappropriate, enough for four or five people instead of three; before the leftovers are finished, new food is cooked, and the spoiled food is thrown away. In this way, although each person has an average of 529 jin of grain, it is all eaten up more than four months before the autumn harvest.
    Currently, although the number of women who cook and eat carelessly like Yang Fenmei is not large in rural areas, there are quite a few people who consume grain without a plan. Therefore, educating rural women to love the country, the cooperative, and the family, to be careful and thrifty, and to save grain is a regular task for grassroots cadres in rural areas.

### 苗金凤和杨粉梅  一个精打细算过时光，年年有余粮  一个乱做乱吃欠打算，缺粮作了难

    苗金凤和杨粉梅
    一个精打细算过时光，年年有余粮  一个乱做乱吃欠打算，缺粮作了难
    本报记者　裴国勋
    一到山西榆社县王景乡的红崖头农业社，社员们就会告诉你：苗金凤是个节约粮食的能手。
    苗金凤家里共有五口人（一个只满五个月的小孩未计算在内。）去年秋季，在社里劳动分粮两千零三斤，加上前年的余粮和一个干部在她家常年包饭的四百多斤粮食，总共是两千六百多斤。按六口人计算，每人平均有粮四百三十多斤。
    虽然苗金凤家有这么多粮食，但她从来不任意浪费一粒，而是精打细算，争取年年粮食有节余，以备歉年。她为了达到这个目的，从粮食一分到手，就开始注意节约粮食。她家经常的饭食用粮计划是这样：在农闲的时候，早上做三合米的稀饭和二升谷的粗面疙瘩；中午做七合米、二合半豆子和麦子面的“和子饭”，再加半升粮食的炒面；晚上，热吃中午的剩饭，再添二合半粮食的炒面。到农忙时，中午再添九合米、减去半升粮食的炒面，把“和子饭”改做为“捞饭”。一般全年有三分之一的中午吃“捞饭”、三分之二的中午吃“和子饭”。这样计算的结果，全家全年有两千一百多斤粮食就够吃了（每人平均三百六十二斤多），能剩余粮食五百多斤。如果抛去过年、过节改善生活食用，最少也能剩余二百多斤。
    同一个社的张四货，去年秋季共分粮一千五百八十六斤，三口人，每人平均五百二十九斤，到7月初就吃光了，不得不向国家伸手要求供应（7月初供应了一百五十斤粮食，到8月中旬又吃光了）。这是为什么？因为他爱人——杨粉梅，平时用粮缺乏精打细算。常常是谷子收下来，就碾成米，不是捞饭、焖饭，就是二难粥（即不干不稀的米饭）；麦子收下来，不是面条、面片，就是烙饼；每顿做下的饭，又常常不合适，三个人的饭够四、五个人吃；剩饭还未吃完，就做新饭，饭坏了就倒掉。就这样，每人虽然平均有五百二十九斤粮食，但是离秋收还有四个多月，就统统吃光了。
    目前，在农村中像杨粉梅这样乱做乱吃的妇女虽然为数不多，但是，用粮无计划的人却为数不少。所以，教育农村妇女爱国、爱社、爱家，精打细算、节约粮食，是农村基层干部的一个经常性的任务。
