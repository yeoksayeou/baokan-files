Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 17th. A type of artificial gold that can replace gold plating on ornaments has recently been successfully trial-produced at the jointly state-private owned Harbin Youlian Fountain Pen Factory.

	Artificial gold is made of a copper-lead alloy. Not only does it have the same beautiful color as gold, but it also has a protective layer of transparent plastic made of phenolic aldehyde resin, making it very tough and resistant to color fading. The pen cases of the "Dunhuang Brand" fountain pens, a new product of the Youlian Fountain Pen Factory to be released in October this year, will all be plated with this artificial gold.

	In the past, the clips and bands on the pen cases of gold pens produced by the Youlian Fountain Pen Factory were plated with gold, which was too expensive. Later, they were changed to white chrome plating. Now, by using artificial gold instead of gold, according to the normal annual output, more than one thousand taels of gold can be saved annually, including the protective layer.

    人造金
    新华社哈尔滨17日电　一种能代替黄金镀在装饰品上的人造金，最近在公私合营哈尔滨友联金笔厂试制成功。
    人造金是用铜铅合金制成的，它不仅和黄金一样色泽美观，而且由于它着了一道用酚酫树脂制成的透明塑料的保护层，韧性很强，色泽不易脱落。将在今年10月出厂的友联金笔厂的新产品“敦煌牌”金笔，它的笔套将全部用这种人造金镀成。
   友联金笔厂出产的金笔，过去笔套上的卡子和圈箍是用黄金镀成的，成本太高，后来改镀白铬。现在用人造金代替黄金，按照正常年产量计算，连同保护层在内，每年可以节省黄金一千两以上。
