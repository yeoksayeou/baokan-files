Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 17th: According to the "Monday Newspaper" here, unemployment among Hungarian workers has now been basically eliminated. The number of workers engaged in industrial production this year has increased by 45,000 compared to last year. Some industrial sectors are already feeling a shortage of manpower, especially in manual labor.

The newspaper pointed out that one of the reasons for the solution of the employment problem is the significant increase in individual small handicraft workers during this period. At the end of September last year, there were 96,475 individual small handicraft workers, and by the end of July this year, the number had reached 120,483.

　　匈牙利失业现象基本消除
    据新华社布达佩斯17日电　据此间“星期一报”说，匈牙利工人失业现象现在已基本上消除。今年从事工业生产的工人比去年增加了四万五千人。现在某些工业部门已经感到人手不足，特别是在体力劳动方面。
    报纸指出，就业问题的获得解决，原因之一是在这一时期内个体小手工业者大大增多了。个体小手工业者在去年9月底有九万六千四百七十五人，而在今年7月底，已经达到了十二万零四百八十三人。
