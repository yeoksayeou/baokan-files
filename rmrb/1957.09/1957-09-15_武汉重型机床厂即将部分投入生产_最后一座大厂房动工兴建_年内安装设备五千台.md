Wuhan, September 12th (Reported by our correspondents Xiao Ding and Wan Qun): On September 9th, the last of the three main factory buildings of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant – the Second Machining Workshop – officially commenced construction. With this, the construction of all factory buildings of this versatile heavy machine tool manufacturing plant has fully begun. Its civil engineering and installation work are proceeding in full swing, and the trial production of heavy-duty machine tools has also started.

Now, when people enter the construction site of the Heavy Machine Tool Plant, they can see a large gray-white gatehouse, which is the main entrance of the factory. Upon entering the gate, the tall, red First Machining Workshop building stands in front of them. The civil engineering and installation work of the three workshops in this building have been basically completed. The bridge cranes spanning the workshop are constantly lifting machine parts and equipment. A small number of workers are still carrying out minor equipment and door and window installation and other finishing work. This workshop is expected to partially commence production in late September. Behind the First Machining Workshop is the largest factory building of the Heavy Machine Tool Plant – the Foundry. On this site, earth-red steel columns and gray-white concrete columns stand like a forest. Dozens of meters high derricks are hoisting roof trusses. Some roof panels have already been installed. In the center of the towering columns, the four tall, black cupola furnaces that have been erected stand out as particularly majestic. Across from the Second Machining Workshop is the newly started Second Machining Workshop. This factory building will be fully completed in the first quarter of next year. Behind the Second Machining Workshop construction site, the huge power facilities – gas station, air compressor station, and boiler room – have been basically completed, with the factory buildings and chimneys forming a red factory area. Some of the gas furnaces, air compressors, and four boilers here have started installation, while others have already been fully completed. Its auxiliary repair facilities – tool, repair, woodworking, and other six workshops have already been put into production.

On the construction site, in addition to hearing the roar of cranes and automobiles, people can also hear the crisp sound of machine installation. Of the 5,000 pieces of standard and non-standard equipment expected to be installed this year, approximately 3,000 pieces have already been installed. It is expected that three machine tools will be manufactured and leave the factory in January next year.

　　武汉重型机床厂即将部分投入生产
    最后一座大厂房动工兴建  年内安装设备五千台
    本报武汉12日电  本报通讯员肖定、万群报道：9月9日，武汉重型机床厂的三大主体厂房中最后一个大厂房——第二机械加工厂正式开工了。至此，这座万能的重型机床制造厂的所有厂房工程已全部开工。它的土建和安装工程已全面交叉进行，重型工作母机的试制工作也已开始。
    现在，人们走进重型机床厂工地，就可以看见一座灰白色的大门楼，这就是工厂的大门。走进门，就看见红色的高大的第一机械加工厂厂房耸立在面前。这座厂房的三大车间的土建安装工作已基本上完成了。横跨厂房的桥式吊车不断地起升着机件设备。少数工人们还在进行细小的设备和门窗的安装等收尾工作。这座厂房预计在本月下旬就部分投入生产。在第一加工厂的后面，是重型机床厂的最大厂房——铸造厂。这个厂地上，土红色的钢柱和灰白色的混凝土的柱子像树林一样竖立起来了。几十公尺高的吊杆正在吊装屋架。有的屋面板已经安装。在林立的柱子中央，高耸起来的四座高大漆黑的化铁冲天炉显得特别雄伟。在第二机械加工厂的对面，就是刚开工建设的第二机械加工厂。这厂房将在明年第一季度全部建成。在第二机械加工厂工地后面，巨大的动力设施——煤气站、空气压缩机站和锅炉房已基本上建成了，厂房和烟囱连成一片红色厂区。这里的煤气炉、空气压缩机和四台锅炉有的开始安装，有的已全部竣工了。它的辅助修理设施——工具、修理、木工等六个车间已经投入生产。
    在工地上，人们除了听到吊车和汽车的轰隆声外，还听到乒乒乓乓的清脆的机器安装声。今年预计要安装的五千台标准和非标准设备，现在已经安装了三千台左右。预计明年1月份，将有三台工作母机制成出厂。
