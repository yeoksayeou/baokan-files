    America's "Atomic Incidents"
    Whenever people mention "atomic incidents," they immediately think of the innocent men, women, and children who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and recall the horrifying faces of atomic victims depicted by the famous Japanese painter Toshiko Akamatsu. However, "atomic incidents" did not only occur in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, the Marshall Islands... Because American imperialists constantly produce and test atomic weapons, "atomic incidents" occur frequently on American soil as well.
    According to a report by the American newspaper "American News," the series of recent "atomic incidents" in the United States have caused great anxiety among the American people.
    On July 29, an American "Globemaster" military heavy aircraft loaded with 25 tons of "atomic bombs and missile warheads" took off from Dover heading for Europe. Forty minutes later, the aircraft, already over the Atlantic Ocean, suddenly had two engines malfunction, and the plane lost control, facing imminent disaster. The navigator was forced to order the "25 tons of atomic bombs or missile warheads to be dumped into the ocean." Afterward, officials consistently avoided specifying what was dumped into the sea. When reporters asked if it was possible to salvage these items and whether there would be danger during salvage, these officials had to vaguely say, "It is impossible to answer this question. As for the danger occurring soon, that is not necessarily the case."
    Shortly after this "atomic incident" occurred, another "atomic incident" shocked the residents of New York State.
    According to the "New York Times," the "General Motors" atomic plant dumped twenty-five barrels of radioactive waste into the ocean three hundred kilometers from New York City. Originally, each barrel was equipped with a special device to make it sink. Unexpectedly, two of these twenty-five barrels refused to sink. One barrel was immediately sunk by an aircraft, while the other barrel containing twenty tons of radioactive waste disappeared. It was found after two days of searching, and then five military aircraft were dispatched to shoot at it from an altitude of four hundred and fifty meters, finally sinking this barrel of radioactive waste. It is said that when the barrel exploded, there was a risk of death from radiation exposure within a radius of three hundred meters.
    These two "atomic incidents" that have been made public have caused unease among American residents, especially those in New York State. People have written letters to the Atomic Energy Commission, protesting the "Atomic Energy Commission's brutal plans, demanding a swift halt to the production and detonation of nuclear weapons."
    In fact, many "atomic incidents" that have harmed people have already occurred in the United States, but the Atomic Energy Commission has consistently blocked this information under the pretext of "military secrets." American secret service agencies have also persecuted newspapers and periodicals that have revealed some details of atomic disasters. However, "paper cannot ultimately contain fire." Recently, the American "Journalist" bi-weekly, the London "Times," and others have revealed some situations since 1951 in which residents in the United States have suffered atomic disasters.
    The Great Basin in Nevada in the western United States has become a disaster-stricken area. It is said that since the atomic test site was established here in early 1951, it has been tested fifty-six times to date. In 1953, three civilians near the test site suffered hair loss and a sharp decline in health due to nuclear testing. There is a ranch one hundred and sixty kilometers north of the test site. After a large-scale nuclear explosion in 1955, a healthy child on this ranch suddenly contracted leukemia and died without a cure. During the same period, a farmer fifty kilometers from this ranch also contracted atomic sickness, lost her hair, and is now on the verge of death. Nevada's neighbor, Utah, is also under the threat of hydrogen bomb testing. Many sheep on ranches three hundred and twenty kilometers north of Cedar City, Utah, were injured due to atomic bomb tests. The people of California, Nevada's southern neighbor, are often frightened of the northeast wind. ...
    Nuclear explosion tests have aroused people's fear and further strengthened their determination to oppose the tests. The American people's call to oppose nuclear testing is growing louder. In July, three petitions with a total of 10,000 signatures were handed to President Eisenhower, resolutely demanding a halt to nuclear weapons testing. On August 6, the dark anniversary of the day the first American atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima, thirty representatives of anti-war groups from across the United States, regardless of the dangers, entered the restricted area of the Nevada test site, shouting: "Willing to go to jail and lose freedom," "Even sacrifice our lives if necessary," to express their protest. U.S. Representative Porter said, "The danger of nuclear explosions is the most significant issue facing the U.S. Congress." This statement is not an exaggeration in light of the American people's growing unease and protests. (Qiao)

### 美国的“原子事件”

    美国的“原子事件”
    当人们一提到“原子事件”时，马上就会联想起在广岛和长崎死于非命的老幼妇孺，记起日本名画家赤松俊子描绘的令人惨不忍睹的原子受害者的面目。但是“原子事件”并不仅发生在广岛、长崎、马绍尔群岛……，由于美帝国主义者不断生产和试验原子武器，在美国本土上，“原子事件”也是层出不穷的。
    据美国“美国人新闻报”报道，美国最近接二连三发生的“原子事件”，已使美国老百姓大为不安。
    7月29日，美国“全球霸王”号军用重型飞机装载了25吨“原子弹和导弹弹头”由多维尔起飞驶向欧洲。四十分钟后，这架已凌驾大西洋上空的飞机，突然间有两个引擎失调，飞机失去了控制，处在千钧一发之间。领航员被迫下令把这“25吨原子弹或导弹弹头丢到海洋里。”事后，官方一直避免言明丢到海里的是些什么。当记者询问是否可以打捞这些东西，打捞时是否会发生危险时，这些官方人士只好含混其词地说：“无法回答这个问题。至于说很快就发生危险倒也未必。”
    就在这次“原子事件”发生后不久，又一“原子事件”震动了纽约州的居民。
    据美国“纽约时报”载，“通用汽车公司”原子工场把二十五筒放射性废料丢到了离纽约市三百公里的海洋里。本来各筒上都装有使筒下沉的特殊装置。不料，这二十五筒中有两筒竟不肯下沉，其中一筒当即用飞机击沉了，而另外一筒装有二十吨放射性废料的却不见了。找了两天才被找到，于是出动了五架军用飞机从四百五十公尺高空向下射击，终于击沉了这筒放射性废料。据说当筒暴破的时候，半径三百公尺之内都有受放射线照射致死的危险。
    这两件公诸极端的“原子事件”，已经引起了美国居民，特别是纽约州居民的不安。人们纷纷写信给原子能委员会，抗议“原子能委员会的残暴计划，要求迅速停止生产、爆破核子武器。”
    其实，在美国早已经发生过许多次使人们遭到危害的“原子事件”，只是原子能委员会一直以“军事秘密”为借口下封锁了这些消息罢了。美国特务机关还迫害多少透露出一些原子灾害实情的报刊。但是，纸“终究是包不住火的”。最近美国“记者”双周刊、伦敦“泰晤士报”等都透露出了自1951年以来，在美国国土上居民遭受原子灾害的一些情况。
    美国西部内华达州这块大盆地成了多难之区。据说，自从1951年初这里建立了原子试验场以来，至今已经试验了五十六次。1953年，试验场附近有三名老百姓由于核试验，全身毛发脱落，身体健康急剧恶化。距试验场北一百六十公里处有一个牧场。在1955年大规模核爆炸后，这个牧场里的一个健壮的孩子突然得了白血球病，无救而死了，就在这同一时期，距这个牧场五十公里处的一个农妇也得了原子病，毛发脱落，至今奄奄待毙。内华达州的毗邻，犹他州也处在氢弹试验的威胁之下，犹他州塞德市北三百二十公里处的牧场，由于原子弹试验，许多头羊受到了伤害。内华达州的南邻，加里福尼亚州的人民，常常胆战心惊地怕刮起东北风。……
    核爆炸试验引起了人们的恐惧，更激起人们反对试验的坚定意志。美国人民反对核试验的呼声日益高昂。7月间有三份一万人的联名信交给了艾森豪威尔总统，他们坚决要求停止核武器试验。在8月6日，美国第一颗原子弹落在广岛上的这个黑暗的纪念日里，美国各地非战主义团体的三十名代表不顾险阻，进入了内华达州试验场禁区，他们高呼：“愿意坐牢和丧失自由”，“在必要时甚至牺牲生命”，来表示他们的抗议。美国众议员波狄尔说“核爆炸的危险是美国国会所面临的最重大的问题”。这一说法，就美国人民日益增加的不安和抗议来说，倒是不为过份的。（樵）
