Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Dispatch: Approximately 70,000 rural work cadres in Hubei Province participated in the socialist education grand debate, according to statistics up to the end of August. The debated issues included: unified purchase and sale of grain, agricultural cooperativization, the worker-peasant alliance, and urban-rural relations. The debates were held at the county level under the leadership of the various county committees of the Chinese Communist Party. Participants included cadres from the county, district, township, and agricultural cooperative levels. The duration of the debate meetings in each county was generally about a week.

In this heated debate, the majority of people cited irrefutable facts to affirm the great achievements of the socialist transformation of the countryside, while also exposing shortcomings and errors in rural work. On the other hand, serious right-leaning sentiments and capitalist thinking of some rural cadres were exposed and criticized. For example, among the more than 1,300 cadres who participated in the debate meeting in Yingshan County, the majority supported the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, some had misunderstandings about it, and only a very small number put forward fallacies in an attempt to deny the policy's significant meaning and achievements. Many cadres refuted these fallacies, pointing out that the situation in the grain market before liberation was "heavy snow falls, rice prices soar"; now that the state controls the grain, grain prices are as stable as Mount Tai, households with surplus grain have ample rations, and households short of grain are guaranteed supply. At the debate meeting in Xiangyang County, individual cadres in Shiyan Township also attempted to use tight grain retention as an excuse to intentionally delay the summer grain unified purchase task, which was criticized by the cadres present.

In the debates on agricultural cooperativization and other issues, the spirit of reasoning struggle, based on presenting facts and reasoning, was implemented, giving the cadres present a profound socialist education. Some cadres who came from well-to-do middle peasant backgrounds and harbored serious capitalist ideas attempted to deny the superiority of cooperativization. Many cadres cited the actual situation of increased agricultural production in their townships and cooperatives over the years, especially the facts of the continuous two years of agricultural bumper harvests after the comprehensive realization of cooperativization in Hubei Province, quickly refuting this fallacy that distorted the facts. At the Yingshan County three-level cadre meeting, after an individual cadre's fallacy that "cooperativization has no superiority" was refuted, they then put forward the fallacy that "cooperativization has no superiority in distribution." Guo Huabai, director of the "Road to Happiness" agricultural cooperative, immediately cited the specific facts of the generally increased income of cooperative members in the cooperative to refute this, saying: "Our cooperative investigated the changes in the lives of 231 households in five production teams: before liberation, 51 households begged for food and 96 households lacked grain; although it was greatly reduced in the early days of liberation, there were still 9 households begging for food and 35 households lacking grain due to individual production being unable to resist natural disasters; the countryside has changed greatly since cooperativization, and now there are only 2 households lacking grain, and begging has long disappeared." This refutation left these people speechless.

After the county cadre debate meetings, rural Party members and Communist Youth League backbones will then be trained in batches and groups to further launch a great airing of views, a great contending, and a great debate.

　　湖北省七万名农村干部参加大辩论
    新华社武汉电　湖北省约有七万名农村工作干部参加了社会主义教育的大辩论，这是截止8月底的统计。辩论的问题有：粮食统购统销、农业合作化、工农联盟和城乡关系问题。辩论会是以县为单位、由中共各县委员会领导举行的。参加辩论的有县、区、乡和农业社的干部。各县辩论会的时间一般是一周左右。
    在这一场热烈的争辩中，大多数人列举出无可辩驳的事实，肯定了农村的社会主义改造的伟大成就，同时也揭发了农村工作中一些缺点和错误；另一方面，也暴露并批判了某些农村干部的严重的右倾情绪和资本主义思想。如应山县参加辩论会的一千三百多名干部中，大多数人拥护粮食统购统销政策，有部分人对统购统销有误解，只有极少数人提出一些谬论，企图否定这个政策的重大意义和成就。许多干部驳斥了这些谬论。指出解放前粮食市场的情况是“大雪纷纷下，大米就涨价”；如今国家掌握了粮食，粮价稳如泰山，余粮户留有充足的口粮，缺粮户保证供应。在襄阳县的辩论会上，石堰乡个别干部也企图以口粮留得紧作为借口，有意拖欠夏季粮食统购任务，遭到了到会干部的批评。
    在农业合作化及其他几个问题的辩论中，贯彻了摆事实、讲道理的说理斗争的精神，使到会干部受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。有些出身富裕中农、存在严重的资本主义思想的干部，企图否认合作化的优越性，许多干部列举了本乡、本社历年农业增产的实际情况，特别是湖北省全面实现合作化后连续两年的农业大丰收的事实，很快就驳倒了这种歪曲事实的谬论。在应山县三级干部会上，个别干部的“合作化没有优越性”的谬论被驳倒后，又发表谬论说，“合作化分配上没有优越性。”“幸福之路”农业社主任郭华柏当场举出本社社员普遍增加收入的具体事实反驳说：“我们社里调查了五个生产队二百三十一户社员的生活变化：解放前有五十一户讨饭，九十六户缺粮；解放初期虽然大大减少了，但是由于个体生产抵抗不住自然灾害的袭击，还有九户讨饭，三十五户缺粮；合作化以后农村大大变了样，如今缺粮户只剩下二户，讨饭的早已绝迹了。”驳得这些人哑口无言。
    各县干部辩论会结束后，接着将分批分片集训农村党员和共青团的骨干，进一步发动大鸣大放大争。
