Combined dispatches of this newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th - Syrian Armed Forces Commander General Bizri accused the United States on the 15th of having "movements to invade Syria." He said that if the United States does not come to attack itself, it "may send people to attack."

At a press conference, Bizri said that five warships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet had entered Syrian territorial waters within nine miles of the Syrian coast, "a show of force in Syrian territorial waters." He also said that many facts prove that the unidentified aircraft seen over Latakia, on the Syrian Mediterranean coast, were American aircraft.

Bizri pointed out: "Turkey has concentrated a corps in the vicinity of the Syrian border, including at least one armored division." He told reporters that if you want to know why this is happening, I think it would be best to ask U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson.

Bizri said that Syria is "taking all steps and measures to defend its independence." Syria is ready.

It is reported that the Damascus Regional Commander of the Syrian People's Resistance Organization has issued an order instructing all new recruits to report to their respective assembly points on September 15 to receive military training. The People's Resistance Organization is a reserve force of the Syrian regular army formed in August last year and is commanded by the Syrian Army.

Cairo dispatch - The International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions issued a statement on the 15th saying that if the United States invades Syria, Arab workers will give the imperialists an even stronger rebuff than they did last year in Port Said.

The statement pointed out that when Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt last year, Arab workers blew up Western oil pipelines and refused to load supplies and services for the invaders' ships and planes. The statement called on Arab workers to demand that the governments of certain Arab countries express their position on the U.S. conspiracy to invade Syria.

　　指责美国企图进攻叙利亚
    本报综合报道据新华社16日讯　大马士革消息，叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里15日指责美国“有进攻叙利亚的动向”。他说，如果美国自己不来进攻，它“可能派人来进攻”。
    比兹里在一次记者招待会上说，美国第六舰队的五艘军舰开进了离叙利亚海岸九英里以内的叙利亚领海，“这是在叙利亚领海内的武力示威”。他还说，许多事实证明，在叙利亚地中海岸拉塔基亚上空见到的身份不明的飞机是美国飞机。
    比兹里指出：“土耳其在邻近同叙利亚交界的地方集中了一个军团，其中至少包括一个装甲师。”他对记者们说，如果你们想知道为什么会发生这种事情，我想最好去问美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊。
    比兹里说，叙利亚正在“采取一切步骤和措施来保卫它的独立”。叙利亚已经准备好了。
    据悉，叙利亚人民抵抗组织大马士革地区司令官已经发布命令，指示一切新兵在9月15日到各自的集中地点报到，以便接受军事训练。人民抵抗组织是去年8月组成的叙利亚正规军队的后备队，由叙利亚陆军指挥。
    开罗消息　阿拉伯工会国际联合会15日发表声明说，如果美国进攻叙利亚，阿拉伯工人将给予帝国主义者比去年在塞得港更有力的回击。
    声明指出，去年英、法、以色列侵略埃及时，阿拉伯工人曾经炸断西方国家的油管，并且拒绝为侵略者的船只和飞机装运物资和服务。声明要求阿拉伯工人们要求某些阿拉伯国家的政府对美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋表明态度。
