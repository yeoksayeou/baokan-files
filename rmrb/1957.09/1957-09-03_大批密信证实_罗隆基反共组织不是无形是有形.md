Massive Secret Letters Confirm:
Luo Longji's Anti-Communist Organization Was Not Formless, But Formed
(Our Newspaper) Sa Kongliao used some of the secret letters voluntarily handed over by Zhao Wenbi and Pan Dakui to prove that the activities of the Luo Longji group were indeed anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist.

Luo Longji argued sophistically that his small group was engaged in sectarian struggles. The first part of the secret letters revealed by Sa Kongliao proved that Luo Longji's small group was not engaged in factional struggles, but was against the Central and local United Front Work Departments of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Party members and non-party progressive figures within the League. In his secret letters, Luo Longji repeatedly warned his cronies not to give in to the United Front Work Department, to insist on arguing, and severely criticized those who were somewhat discouraged, scolding them for being timid. In a letter from Luo Longji to Pan Dakui on February 10, 1951, he said: "The Southwest is a must-contend point, and you must work hard. Once, the person in charge of the Chongqing United Front Work Department (seemed to be surnamed Yang) reported on the situation in Chongqing and made quite a few accusations against you... I immediately refuted him at the meeting, leaving him speechless." In letters to Zhao Wenbi on April 30, May 23, and June 18 of the same year, he instructed Zhao Wenbi "not to absolutely obey the United Front Work Department," "and even more not to individually and privately curry favor to disrupt the steps and break up unity." "If the Shanghai United Front Work Department must manipulate the Shanghai Democratic League..., I will absolutely not give in. And convey this meaning to our friends so that they can step up their efforts." "Not allowing the Shanghai Democratic League to hold elections (referring to the Shanghai United Front Work Department) is openly helping the National Salvation Association and insulting all members of the Shanghai League. It is excessive timidity and laughable for you to endure this." Because Luo Longji wanted to "argue" with the United Front Work Department, he extremely hated the United Front Work Department helping the democratic parties with their work. Once at a meeting convened by the United Front Work Department, someone proposed that the United Front Work Department use the method of "sending senior officials" to help the democratic parties with their work. After the meeting, Luo Longji wrote in a secret letter to Zhao Wenbi: "I made a big scene at the meeting, and then the United Front Work Department abandoned this idea. If senior officials were really sent, it would be even more difficult for you to struggle."

In his many secret letters, Luo Longji did everything possible to slander and smear Communist Party members and progressive elements within the democratic parties. When Comrade Zhou Xinmin (a Communist Party member) was transferred away from the Democratic League, Luo Longji hurriedly wrote a secret letter to Pan Dakui, a member of the small group. The letter said that after Zhou Xinmin was transferred away, "generally speaking, left-leaning, childish, narrow-minded, and selfish people will lose their backing and will definitely examine themselves more carefully, which will be more beneficial to the League's affairs and to us." Therefore, he instructed Pan Dakui to be "good at dealing with" progressive elements within the League, "strive for assistants, use organization to deal with organization, use collective to deal with collective, and the future will be consolidated and developed, and the Democratic League will definitely have final success." This letter was written on January 14, 1951. On February 10, 1951, in a secret letter to Fan Puzhai, he repeatedly expressed his "applause and joy" about this matter, and said extremely viciously, "In the past, you always believed that if treacherous officials were not removed, the League would have no future and we would have no way to do things. Now that the treacherous official has left, you can get up and do things." Also on this day, he said in a secret letter to Pan Dakui: "This year, the Communist Party itself seeks consolidation and does not develop. Some people in the Communist Party will be expelled, and some will be allowed to voluntarily withdraw. Therefore, left-wing childish people, whether they are party members or not, will be subject to considerable sanctions this year... I hope you will convey this meaning to your friends, and in proceeding, you must have a plan, steps, organization, and unity."

Not only that, but Luo Longji also tried his best to place his cronies in state organs. In a secret letter to Zhao Wenbi on October 26, 1949, he said: "When the central organs are established, there is a great shortage of talent. The Executive Yuan has decided to widely search for former staff... You can immediately carry out this matter in Shanghai, but do not mention that I have this letter, lest it be used as material to attack me. And please send me the resumes and wishes of your close friends such as Zhu Gaorong, Sun Siming, Zhou Chengde, and Xue Baokang as soon as possible for reference."

After exposing these secret letters of Luo Longji, Sa Kongliao said: The above materials completely prove that the spearhead of the Luo Longji group is directed at the Communist Party.

The second part of the secret letters revealed by Sa Kongliao confirmed that the Luo Longji group had indeed engaged in many activities under the guise of sectarianism, such as attacking and excluding leftists, and seizing the leadership and real power of the central and local leading organs of the Democratic League. In a secret letter from Luo Longji to Zhao Wenbi on January 5, 1951, he said: "To sum up, the headquarters has achieved a balance. If we can unite and work hard, then we have actually gained the upper hand, because the Xuan, Wen, and Cai committees are presided over by us. And we have responsible persons in both the organization and secretarial departments. After a year of struggle, we can be satisfied with this result, and we should strive for development in the future." "The situation in Beijing has also improved recently... In the Beijing elections in May of this year, we can be completely victorious. But this matter must not be talked about too much to outsiders, so that others will be prepared. What friends are most concerned about is the Shanghai problem, and we must use all our efforts to strive for this focus." Before and after this, Luo Longji did indeed put a lot of effort into seizing the leading power of the Shanghai League. At that time, Zhao Wenbi was still in Shanghai, and Luo Longji said in a secret letter to Zhao: "I think your future should be planned on the leadership position in the League. Participating in the government with the identity of a democratic party will result in a higher position in the future. It is not easy to quickly improve your position as a civil servant." When Pan Dakui arrived in Shanghai, Luo Longji wrote another letter to Zhao Wenbi, instructing Zhao to "discuss everything in detail with Pan Dakui about the affairs of the Shanghai League and talk with him earnestly. I have also entrusted him to convey my views on the affairs of the Shanghai League."

In his confession, Luo Longji flatly denied that the small group had any activities after 1952. He said: After 1952, no one was sent out, no letters were written, and no verbal messages were conveyed. The third part of the secret letters revealed by Sa Kongliao precisely confirmed that from 1953 to 1957, the Luo Longji group's anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities did not stop, but were only carried out more covertly. In a secret letter from Luo Longji to Zhao Wenbi on August 26, 1953, he said: "I arrived at Guling, Lushan on August 1st..., rested for a month, and prepared to go down the mountain and return north on September 1st. The responsible comrades of Jiangxi Province and Comrade Xu Deyuan of the Jiangxi League were all on the mountain... I would never dare to disturb my friends when I pass through Shanghai. But several responsible friends in the League hope to have the opportunity to meet and talk, such as Shen Zhiyuan, Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, and you, etc. I always hope to see them." In a secret letter from Peng Wenyin to Luo Longji on October 30, 1953, he also asked Luo Longji for instructions on his work. The letter said: "The election of the Shanghai Municipal Branch after two months of preparation has been completed. The number of members has increased from twenty-two to thirty-eight. The main part of the directors and deputy directors and the various departments remain the same. How to do a good job in the future, I hope to receive instructions in your letter." After Zhao Wenbi was transferred to Beijing in 1957, he said in a secret letter to Peng Wenyin in Shanghai on February 27 that Luo Longji wanted to have a long talk with him as soon as he arrived in Beijing, so he would stay at Luo Longji's house for a few days first. The letter also said: "I have already talked to him about your matter. He said that it is the same as before. He mentioned you in this nomination... but it was rejected when it was circled."

After the start of the Great Blooming and Letting, Peng Wenyin wrote to Luo Longji in a secret letter on June 1: "Recently, the opinions you put forward have been published in the newspaper (note: referring to Luo's fallacy of the 'Rehabilitation Committee'). I and the comrades here all unanimously think that it is very good, insightful, and representative... The Shanghai Propaganda Work Conference and the CPPCC have been enthusiastic in the last two meetings. I have also spoken, and the response is quite good. What was called 'random talk' in the past was actually the blow and oppression inflicted on me by the evil forces of dogmatism and sectarianism. Today, it seems that they were wrong, not me. In the recent symposium of the United Front Work Department, I have exposed the sectarian elements (including some reactionary elements) who have manipulated and controlled the Shanghai League over the years. Because some people in the CPPCC sharply criticized some democratic figures, it caused the angry counterattack of those sycophants. However, public opinion and the grassroots masses of the democratic parties all believe that the criticism is correct, and that those servile people among the upper-level leaders of the democratic parties are indeed despicable." On the same day, Peng Wenyin said in a secret letter to Zhao Wenbi to Luo Longji: "Recently, the situation within the League, on the surface, there is no major change, but the eagerness to try and the turbulent emotions in the grassroots and among the masses can be seen. The situation in which the vast masses have been suppressed and manipulated by a few people for a long time seems to be a matter of time before problems arise. Recently, Lu Mang, Zhang Dachun, Hua Wenkui, Han Ming, Song Shima, Xu Buwu, Wu Zhennan, and others from the Counselor's Office spoke at the CPPCC, accusing those flattery democratic people, on the one hand, aroused the counter-attack and encirclement of similar people in various parties, and at the same time, received support from the society and grassroots members. I support them."

Sa Kongliao said: The above secret letters can completely prove that from 1953 to 1957, the Luo Longji anti-communist conspiracy group has been continuing its activities, with instructions and reports. A letter from Luo Longji to Zhao Wenbi in Lushan, which seemed to be a report on his whereabouts, has now been completely clarified: it contains two conspiracy meetings. The so-called "responsible comrades of Jiangxi Province and Comrade Xu Deyuan of the Jiangxi League were all on the mountain" implies the secret meeting attended by Luo Longji, Ma Zhemin, Xu Deyuan, and Liu Defeng in Lushan that everyone now knows. And the so-called "I cannot disturb my friends when I pass through Shanghai, but several responsible friends in the League hope to have the opportunity to meet and talk" is a pre-arranged secret meeting of the Shanghai conspiracy group that he convened when he passed through Shanghai. In short, "we will not engage in sectarianism in 1952" is a complete and utter lie.

    大批密信证实
    罗隆基反共组织不是无形是有形
    本报讯  萨空了用赵文璧、潘大逵自动交出来的一部分密信，来证实罗隆基集团所进行的确是反共、反人民、反社会主义活动。
    罗隆基狡辩，说他小集团是搞宗派斗争的。萨空了揭发的第一部分密信，证明了罗隆基的小集团并不是搞派系斗争的，而是反对中国共产党中央和地方统战部和盟内的共产党员以及无党派的进步人士的。罗隆基在他的密信中，一再告诫他的党羽不要对统战部让步，一定要争持，并痛斥有点气馁的人，骂这些人胆小。1951年2月10日罗隆基给潘大逵的信中说：“西南为必争之点，兄务必努力。有一次重庆统战部负责人（仿佛姓杨）报告重庆情况，对兄颇有指责，……我在会场中立即加以反驳，使他无话可答”。同年4月30日、5月23日、6月18日在给赵文璧的信中，指示赵文璧“不必绝对服从统战部”，“更不要个别私自讨好以自乱步骤，拆散团结。”“倘上海统战部必须操纵上海民盟……，我是绝对不会让步的。并以此意转告我辈朋友，以便加紧进行努力”。“不让上海民盟进行选举（指上海统战部）是公开帮救国会，是侮辱上海全部盟员，公等忍而受之，实过分胆小，实亦可笑。”由于罗隆基要和统战部“争持”，所以他极力仇视统战部到民主党派帮助工作。有一次统战部召开的会上，有人提出要求统战部用“派大员”的办法帮助各民主党派工作。会后，罗隆基在给赵文璧的密信中写道：“我在会上大闹一场，而后统战部才放弃此种意见，假使真派大员，诸位的斗争就更困难了。”
    罗隆基在他的许多密信中，对共产党员、民主党派内进步分子极尽谩骂、污蔑之能事。当周新民同志（共产党员）调离民盟工作时，罗隆基连忙给小集团的成员潘大逵写密信，信中说，周新民调走后，“一般左倾幼稚病偏狭自私之徒失去靠山，必更检点，此于盟务及我辈必更有利”，于是指示潘大逵对于盟内进步分子“善于应付”，“争取助手，以组织对付组织，以集体对付集体，而前途是巩固与发展，民盟则必有最后成功。”这封信是1951年1月14日写的。1951年2月10日他在给范朴斋的密信中又一再对此事表示“鼓掌称快”，并极其恶毒地说“兄以往总认为奸臣不去，盟无前途，我辈无做法。今奸臣已去，兄可以起来做了。”也是在这天，他给潘大逵的密信说：“今年共产党本身求巩固，不发展，共产党有些人会被开除，有些人会让其自愿退出，故左派幼稚者无论是党与非党，今年会受相当制裁。……望兄将此意转告友人，在进行上必须有计划、有步骤、有组织、有团结。”
    不仅如此，罗隆基还竭力将他的党羽安插在国家机关。1949年10月26日他给赵文璧的密信上说：“中枢各机关设立，人才十分缺乏，政院中已决定广泛搜罗旧时工作人员。……此事兄可在上海立即进行，但不必言及弟有此函，以为他人攻击材料，并请兄将接近之友人如朱高融、孙斯鸣、周承德、薛葆康等之履历及愿望速即寄弟，以便参考。”
    萨空了在揭发了罗隆基的这些密信后说：以上材料完全证明罗隆基集团的矛头是指向共产党的。
    萨空了揭发的第二部分密信证实了罗隆基集团也确曾在宗派主义的幌子下，作了许多打击、排斥左派、夺取民盟中央和地方领导机关领导实权的勾当。1951年1月5日罗隆基给赵文璧的密信中说：“概括来说总部已做到平衡，若我辈能团结努力，则我辈实已占了优势，因宣、文、财三委由我辈主持。而组、秘两方我辈均已有了负责人。一年奋斗，有此结果，自可满意，今后应力求发展。”“北京市最近亦好转，……本年5月间北京市选举可操全胜。但此事切不可向外人多说，使他人多有准备。朋友们最关心的还是上海问题，此重点我辈必用全力争取。”在此以前和以后，罗隆基对于夺取上海盟的领导实权，的确是煞费苦心的，当时赵文璧还在上海，罗隆基在给赵的密信中说：“兄之前途弟以为应在盟中领导地位上打算。用民主党派身份参加政府，地位将来可高。若以公务员身份硬欲短时提高实非易事。”潘大逵到上海的时候，罗隆基又写信给赵文璧，指示赵与潘大逵“对沪盟务详商一切，与之恳谈，弟对沪上盟务亦已托其转达”。
    罗隆基在他的交代中，曾矢口抵赖1952年以后小集团有什么活动，他说：1952年以后，没有派人出去，没有写过信，没有带过口信。萨空了揭发的第三部分密信恰恰证实了罗隆基集团从1953年到1957年中，反党、反人民、反社会主义的活动并没有停止，只是干得更加隐蔽而已。1953年8月26日罗隆基给赵文璧的密信中说：“我8月1日到了庐山牯岭……，休息了一个月，准备9月1号下山北返。江西省负责各位和江西盟中许德瑗同志都同在山上。……我过沪时绝不敢叨扰朋友。但盟中几位负责朋友希望能有机会晤谈，如沈志远、彭文应、陈仁炳和兄等，我总希望能见到”。1953年10月30日彭文应致罗隆基的密信，还向罗隆基请示工作，信中说：上海市支部经过两月筹备之选举已竣事，委员由二十二人增至三十八人，正副主任及各部会大部照旧，今后如何做好，盼来信指示。”1957年赵文璧调来北京后，在2月27日给上海彭文应的密信中说，刚到北京，罗隆基就要和他长谈，因此要先在罗隆基家住几天。信中还说：“关于你的事，已与他谈过。他说和以前一样，此次提名，他提到你，……但圈定时被否决。”
    大鸣大放开始以后，彭文应于6月1日写给罗隆基的密信中说：“最近报上发表你所提意见，（按：指罗‘平反委员会’的谬论）我及此间同志均一致认为很好，有见地及代表性。……上海宣传工作会及政协最近两次会中均热烈。我亦都发了言，反映颇好。过去所被称为‘乱说说’实是教条主义、宗派主义恶势力所加我之打击压迫，今日看来，错在他们而不在我。我在最近统战部座谈会中已把历年来操纵把持上海盟那些宗派分子（包括一些反动分子）当面揭露。由于政协中有人尖锐批评一些民主人士曾引起那些拍马屁分子恼羞成怒的反击，但是，社会舆论及民主党派基层群众均认为批评得对，而认为民主党派上层领导人中那些奴颜婢膝之辈，确属可鄙。”同一天，彭文应给赵文璧转罗隆基的密信中说：“最近盟内形势，表面上看虽无大变动，不过基层中及群众中跃跃欲试动荡情绪是可以看出来的。广大群众长期被少数人压抑操纵的局面，看来是迟早会要发生问题的。最近参事室鲁莽、张大椿、华文奎、韩鸣、宋式马、许卜五、吴振南等向政协发言，指责那些拍马的民主人士，一方面引起各党派中同类人的反攻围剿，同时却得到社会上及基层成员的支持。我是支持他们的。”
    萨空了说：以上这些密信完全可以证明从1953年到1957年罗隆基反共阴谋集团一直在继续活动，有指示，有报告。罗隆基在庐山给赵文璧的一封似乎是报告行踪的信，现在已经完全弄清：其中包含着两次阴谋会议，所谓“江西省负责各位和江西盟中许德瑗同志都在山上”，就暗示现在大家已知道的庐山举行的罗隆基、马哲民、许德瑗、刘德烽四头参加的密会。而所谓“我过沪时不能叨扰朋友，但盟中几位负责朋友希望有机会晤谈”，就是预先安排他过沪时召开的上海阴谋集团密会。总而言之，“1952年就不搞宗派了”，完全是彻头彻尾的弥天大谎。
