Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 14th: Gong Wenhui, a thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer from Guilin Township, Jianyang County, Fujian Province, recently shot and killed a black bear weighing over 200 pounds.

One day in early July, Gong Wenhui went up the mountain alone with a basket to pick yangmei berries. After walking four or five *li* along a dense, shaded path, he suddenly saw a wild animal the size of a calf in the woods ahead, with its head raised, eating yangmei berries. He took a closer look and realized it was a big black bear. He immediately ran home to find someone, but his father and neighbors had all gone to the fields to work, and there was no one free in the township. So, he took his father's shotgun, loaded it, and turned around and ran into the woods. When he reached a spot only twenty steps away from the bear, he hid behind an old pine tree and aimed at the bear's abdomen, firing with a "bang." The bear was hit in the stomach, blood gushing out, and it thrashed wildly, roaring like thunder, before finally collapsing to the ground and not moving.

　　十三岁少年打死一只大狗熊
    据新华社福州14日电  福建建阳县桂林乡十三岁的少先队员龚文辉，不久前一枪打死了一只两百多斤重的大狗熊。
    7月初的一天，龚文辉一人提着篮子上山采杨梅。走了四、五里深密的林荫路，忽然看见前面树林里有一只像小牛大的野兽，仰着头，在吃杨梅。他定眼一看，原来是只大狗熊。他立即跑回家找人，但是他父亲和邻居都下田生产去了，乡里没有闲人。他便拿了他父亲的猎枪，推弹上膛，扭身就往林子里跑。当他跑到距离狗熊只有二十来步的一个地方时，就躲到一株老松树背后，对准狗熊的腹部“砰”的一枪。狗熊的肚子中弹后，鲜血淋漓，四处乱扑，吼声如雷，终于扑倒在地上不动了。
