    Capital City Workers Conduct Great Debate and Air Views Enthusiastically
    The Broad Masses Speak Freely, Posting 110,000 Big-Character Posters; Leading Cadres Seriously Study Various Opinions and Implement Rectification and Improvement Simultaneously
    (Our Reporter Guo Longchun) Since mid-August, the main factories, mines, and transportation enterprises in Beijing have launched the rectification movement in full swing. At present, state-owned factories and mines and municipal transportation enterprises have set off a high tide of airing views; the first batch of rectification units in local state-owned and joint state-private factories have also begun to conduct great debates and air views.
    Before the full-scale rectification began, most units' leaders explained the significance of the rectification movement to all employees with a sincere attitude, calling on employees to boldly express their opinions and carry out criticism. Some unit leaders also convened meetings with technicians, or talked with employees individually, expressing their determination to listen to opinions and correct their work. Many units also set up reception rooms, scribe offices, and stationery supply points to create conditions for employees to express their opinions.
    The broad masses of employees participated in the rectification movement with great enthusiasm. Many people actively expressed their opinions through big-character posters, forums, and group meetings. By September 5, more than 110,000 big-character posters had been posted by employees in just over 40 larger state-owned factories and mining enterprises. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has already received 4,800 opinions from more than 2,700 employees. The opinions raised by employees include many aspects such as production management, cadre work style, welfare, political and ideological education, and national policies, with the most opinions concerning production management. Many opinions expose the existing shortcomings in enterprises and are of great significance for improving work.
    Employees paid attention to ensuring that rectification and production were not neglected. On the same day that the young blast furnace workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant were preparing to participate in rectification, they also discussed measures to ensure that production would not be delayed. In the recent thirteen days, they not only put forward more than 190 opinions, but also produced more than 330 tons of pig iron more than the operation plan in terms of production.
    All units have promptly sorted out and studied the opinions raised by employees. Some units have already begun to solve problems that can be solved immediately. The CCP Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory Committee made a preliminary analysis and ranking of the opinions raised by employees, among which 13 items involving 120 issues have been resolved or are being resolved. On August 30, the factory held an employee meeting to explain the above issues to all employees, which further boosted the enthusiasm of the employees to air their views. In the past, the drafting group of the technical maintenance section of the Municipal Telephone Bureau had requested the general affairs section to solve the problem of installing drawing cabinets, but it had not been resolved for eight months; on August 23, the comrades of this group posted a big-character poster criticizing this matter; on the 26th, the relevant parties solved the problem. The group then posted a big-character poster written in color, expressing warm support for the Party's policy of "rectifying and improving simultaneously." Now, the bureau has solved or is in the process of solving more than 300 problems. The Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory held a meeting of employee representatives to study opinions on how to deal with various issues together with the representatives. Many employees are very satisfied with this practice of promptly handling problems and giving an explanation for every opinion of the masses, and their enthusiasm for participating in the Party's rectification is even higher.
    Employees in some units have already launched debates on some opinions that need to be clarified through discussion. Some employees in the boiler workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant raised the opinion that the working conditions were too poor, but other employees disagreed. They have already begun to discuss this issue.
    At present, the leaders of a few units have not been open enough in mobilizing the masses, and since the rectification began, employees have not raised many opinions. Relevant leading departments have requested these units to actively reverse this situation.

    首都职工大鸣大放热火朝天
    广大群众畅所欲言已贴出大字报十一万张  领导人员认真研究各种意见贯彻边整边改
    本报讯　记者郭龙春报道：8月中旬以来，北京市各主要工厂、矿山和交通运输企业先后全面展开整风运动。目前，国营厂矿和市属交通运输企业已经掀起鸣放热潮；地方国营和公私合营工厂的第一批整风单位，也已经开始大鸣大放。
    大多数单位的领导人员在全面整风开始以前，都以诚恳的态度向全体职工说明了整风运动的意义，号召职工大胆提出意见，开展批评。有些单位的领导人还召集技术人员等开会，或者找职工个别谈心，表示虚心听取意见、改正工作的决心。不少单位还设立了接待室、代书处、笔墨纸张供应处等，为职工发表意见创造条件。
    广大职工都以极大的热情参加整风运动。许多人通过大字报、座谈会、小组会等形式，积极发表了自己的意见。仅四十多个较大的国营厂矿企业到9月5日止，职工们就贴出了十一万多张大字报。石景山钢铁厂已经有两千七百多人提出了四千八百多条意见。职工们提出的意见，包括生产管理、干部作风、生活福利、政治思想教育以及国家政策等许多方面，其中以对生产管理方面的意见最多。很多意见揭露了企业中目前存在的缺点，对改进工作有重大意义。
    职工们注意到了整风、生产两不误。石景山钢铁厂青年高炉工人在酝酿参加整风的当天，也讨论了如何保证不耽误生产的措施。在最近十三天中，他们不仅提出了一百九十多条意见，在生产方面，还比作业计划多生产了三百三十多吨生铁。
    各单位对职工提出的意见都及时进行了整理、研究。有些单位已经着手解决马上可以解决的问题。中共国营北京第二棉纺织厂委员会对职工提出的意见进行了初步的分析排队，其中有十三项一百二十件问题已经解决或者正在解决。8月30日，这个厂召开职工大会，把上述问题向全厂职工作了交代，职工们鸣放热情更加高涨。市内电话局技术维护科绘图组过去曾要求总务科解决装图纸柜的问题，历时八个月没有解决；8月23日，这个组的同志贴出大字报批评了这件事情；26日，有关方面就把这个问题解决了。这个组又贴出了一张用彩色写的大字报，对党的“边整风，边改进”的方针表示热烈拥护。现在，这个局已经或正在解决的问题有三百多件。国营北京第一棉纺织厂曾召开职工代表会议，和代表们一起研究对各种问题处理的意见。很多职工对这种及时处理问题、对群众意见件件有交代的作法十分满意，他们参加党整风的热情也更加高涨。
    有些单位的职工已经对一些需要通过讨论来弄清是非的意见展开了争论。石景山发电厂锅炉车间有的职工提出了劳动条件太差的意见，其他职工不同意。他们已经开始就这个问题进行讨论。
    现在，还有少数单位的领导人员对发动群众不够放手，整风开始以来，职工提的意见还不多。有关领导方面已经要求这些单位积极扭转这种情况。
