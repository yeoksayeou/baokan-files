    哈达博士在鞍山参观访问
    据新华社鞍山26日电　印度尼西亚前副总统哈达博士在钢都鞍山参观时说，他在中国见到的工业化方面的事实，更坚定了印度尼西亚走工业化道路的信心。
    哈达博士和随他来访问的高级官员今天参观了鞍钢的炼铁厂、第二炼钢厂、大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂。成群的钢铁工人在工厂门口热情地欢迎贵宾。参观工厂以后，贵宾们又来到居住着数千户钢铁工人的友好街住宅区访问了两个工人的家庭。哈达博士还看了这个住宅区的百货商店，他指着橱窗里放着的各种大衣、彩色被单等商品向营业员一一询问了价格。接着贵宾们又参观了鞍钢技术图书馆，观看了这里的数万册外文藏书。哈达博士坐在图书馆的自修室里对鞍钢经理袁振说，他到这里看到的一切远远超过了他预先的想像。
