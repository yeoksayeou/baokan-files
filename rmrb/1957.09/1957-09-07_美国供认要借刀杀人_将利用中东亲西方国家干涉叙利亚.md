Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on September 5th stating that the State Department will study Henderson's anti-Syria proposal based on Eisenhower's emergency statement on Middle East policy. This statement indicates that the United States will interfere through "aid" to Syria's neighboring countries under the guise of anti-communism.

The statement also mentioned that Secretary of State Dulles will soon report to Eisenhower on the issue of opposing Syria. Sources say the report is scheduled for September 7th.

At the same time, the United States is accelerating the strengthening of the military power of Syria's pro-Western neighbors. The first batch of U.S. weapons for Jordan will begin to be airlifted in a few days. In order to speed up delivery, the United States will use military supplies stored in the European region, and some of them will be shipped to Lebanon first. The United States has also decided to speed up the delivery of weapons to Turkey and Iraq.

According to U.S. officials, the U.S. government is doing this to encourage these countries to be bold and launch provocations against Syria.

    美国供认要借刀杀人
    将利用中东亲西方国家干涉叙利亚
    新华社6日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务院9月5日发表声明，表示国务院将根据艾森豪威尔关于中东政策的紧急声明来研究汉德逊的反叙利亚建议。这个声明表明，美国将在反共的幌子下通过对叙利亚邻国的“援助”来进行干涉。
    声明还提到，国务卿杜勒斯即将就反对叙利亚的问题向艾森豪威尔作报告。有消息说，报告预定在9月7日举行。
    同时，美国正在以加快的速度来加强叙利亚的亲西方邻国的军事力量。美国给约旦的武器，几天内就要开始第一批空运。为了更快地交货，美国将动用欧洲地区存储的军用物资，有一部分将最先运给黎巴嫩。美国还决定加快运武器给土耳其和伊拉克。
    据美国官员透露，美国政府这样做的目的是为了鼓励这些国家大胆起来向叙利亚发起挑衅。
