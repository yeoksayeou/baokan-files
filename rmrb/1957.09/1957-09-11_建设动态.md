    Gyangtse Bridge Completed
    The second bridge across the Nyang Chu River—the Gyangtse Bridge—has recently been completed.
    The completion of this bridge, which is ninety-five meters long, connects the Shigatse-Yatung Highway with the urban area of Gyangtse—a famous handicraft city in Tibet—providing more convenient conditions for transportation and trade between Gyangtse and other places. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The Second Highway on the Sichuan-Gansu Border
    The second highway connecting the Tibetan areas on the border of Sichuan and Gansu provinces—the Langmu Temple-Diangansi Highway—is under intense construction.
    This highway starts from Langmu Temple (within Zoige County, Sichuan) on the Lanzhou-Aba Highway, extends northeast, passes through the famous Zoige Grassland, and reaches Diangansi Temple in Zhuoni County, Gansu Province, with a total length of more than 70 kilometers.
    An Average of One Power Station Per County
    Sichuan Province's electric power industry has greatly developed during the first Five-Year Plan period. Now, on average, each county has a small power plant or hydroelectric station, and many towns have been using electricity for rice milling, flour milling, oil extraction, cotton ginning, water lifting for irrigation, farm tool repair, and lighting.
