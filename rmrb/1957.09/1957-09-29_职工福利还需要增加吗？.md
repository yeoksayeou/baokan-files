    Do Workers' Benefits Need to Be Increased?
    Benefits Should Be Increased
    Meetings always say the mine is the workers' home, but dormitories have to be built with workers' own contributions and public assistance, which is unreasonable. ...Now, workers have to pay for housing, water, lodging, and food. You can't do anything without money. Advancing towards socialism should mean increased benefits, but now it's increasing burdens. ...Families have to pay for medical treatment now, and electricity costs money too. What kind of sense does that make?
        He Yuxi, Water Prospecting Worker, Chengzhi Coal Mine
    Rent and Water Fees Should Be Charged
    I disagree with He Yuxi's statement. Now, the state is using funds to help workers solve housing difficulties; many water pipes have been installed to facilitate water use for workers' families. In order to gradually invest these funds in construction, the state charges a very small amount of rent and water fees. What's wrong with that? He Yuxi, have you forgotten the suffering of us coal miners in the past? Who treated us like human beings back then? What kind of life did we live, and what kind of houses did we live in?

    The Public Cannot Cover Everything
    He Yuxi, you say that building houses with workers' own contributions and public assistance is unreasonable. Does that mean that workers, being the masters of their own affairs, should have the public cover all their living problems? Think about who cared about these things in the past? Not to mention living in houses, no one cared even if you had nothing to eat. Now, the allocation of houses and production matters are all handled according to the resolutions of the workers' representative assembly. What is that if not workers being the masters of their own affairs? You know about advancing towards socialism, but you don't know that during the stage of building socialism, we must also be diligent and thrifty. How can you only think about yourself?

    Should Not Be Ungrateful
    He Yuxi's statement that building houses with workers' own contributions and public assistance is unreasonable is completely wrong. Building houses with workers' own contributions and public assistance solves the urgent housing problems of workers. Currently, China is carrying out socialist construction and needs a large amount of funds. If all the funds were put into living benefits, it would affect national construction. Think about the workers before liberation. Not to mention living in new houses, even living in small, broken houses required two bags of flour per month. Now you live in a new house and you are still not satisfied, which is too inappropriate.

    Don't Forget Your Roots After Emancipation
    He Yuxi, let me ask you: could you bring your family as a worker in the old society? Now you can support a family of five on your own, eating white rice and white flour, wearing brand new clothes. Have you forgotten the past suffering? Do you still remember what the bureaucrat capitalists and foremen said: "We don't need two-legged toads, we have plenty of two-legged people." They simply didn't treat us miners as human beings. Now that we have been emancipated, you shouldn't forget your roots.

### 职工福利还需要增加吗？

    职工福利还需要增加吗？
    应当增加福利
    开会老说矿山是工人的家，可是宿舍却要自建公助，这不合理。……现在，工人住房要房钱，喝水要水钱，住店要店钱，吃饭要饭钱，哪样没钱也不行。向社会主义迈进应当增加福利，现在却是增加负担。……家属看病也要起钱来了，用电也得花钱，这是什么道理？
        城子煤矿　探水工人何玉玺
    房租水费应该收
    我不同意何玉玺的说法。现在，国家拿出一部分资金帮助职工解决住房困难；为了便于职工家属用水，修了很多自来水管。国家为了把这些资金逐步投入建设中去，收了很低的一点房钱和水费，这有什么不对呢？何玉玺，你忘了我们煤矿工人过去的苦处了吗？过去谁把我们当人看待呢？那时候过的是什么生活，住的是什么房子？
    城子煤矿　一职工
    不能让公家都包下来
    何玉玺，你说自建公助盖房子不合理，难道说，工人当家作主，就应该把所有的生活问题都让公家包下来吗？你想想以前谁管你这些事呀？别说住房子，就是吃不上饭也没人管。现在分配房子以及生产上的事，哪样不是按着职工代表会决议办事？这不是工人当家作主是什么？你知道向社会主义迈进，你就不知道在建设社会主义的阶段还要勤俭节约，你怎么光为个人打算？
    城子煤矿运输工人
    不该不知足
    何玉玺说自建公助不合理，这种说法完全是错误的。自建公助，为职工解决了迫切需要解决的住房问题。目前我国正在进行社会主义建设，需要大量资金，如果把资金全部放在生活福利方面，就会影响国家建设。你想想，解放前的工人，别说住新房，就是住小破房每月还得两袋面粉。现在住了新房你还不满足，太不应该。
  　城子煤矿　丁保岐
    翻身莫忘本
    何玉玺，我问你：在旧社会你当工人能带家眷吗？现在你一个人能养活五口人，吃的白米白面，穿着崭新的衣服，你忘了过去的苦处吗？你是不是还记得官僚资本家、大把头说过的话：“要两条腿的蛤蟆没有，要两条腿的人有的是”。他们根本不把我们矿工当人看，现在我们翻了身，你不应忘了本。
