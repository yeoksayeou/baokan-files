    Jiangxi's anti-Rightist struggle is developing in a broad, deep, and thorough manner. Since late August, a group of heinous rightists have been continuously exposed in industrial and commercial circles, medical circles, education circles, literary and art circles, engineering and technical personnel, and small cities. These include Luo Shiyang (Deputy Secretary-General of the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association), Wu Boshen, and Wu Shuqing from industrial and commercial circles; Yao Hesheng (Deputy Director of the Jiangxi Traditional Chinese Medicine Experimental Institute) and Luo Bingzhong (Director of Orthopedic Surgery at Nanchang First Hospital) from the medical field; Zhao Zeping (teacher at Nanchang No. 1 Middle School) and Ben Xiaoyu (Director of the President's Office at Nanchang Normal College) from the education field; Shi Ming (Director of the Jiangxi Mass Art Museum) and Wei Xin (actor from the Jiangxi Provincial Drama Troupe) from the literary and art field; Yuan Jiuzhang (Deputy Chief Engineer of a certain mine) from engineering and technical personnel; and Li Shuhua (Chairman of the Ji'an Municipal Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang), Tao Yimin (Executive Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce), He Xingnan (Chairman of the Shangrao Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League), Liu Yiyan (Chairman of the Jingdezhen Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League), and Zhou Dahong (Chairman of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party) from small cities.

    These rightists have launched attacks on the Party in an organized, planned, programmatic, step-by-step, and strategic manner. Many of them are "commanders" or behind-the-scenes directors in one area. In Shangrao, the rightist He Xingnan, at the beginning of the rectification movement, incited intellectuals by saying that the Party "suspects intellectuals more than it respects them," distorting the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. In Jingdezhen, the rightist Liu Yiyan not only made vicious anti-communist remarks but also maliciously incited people by saying "buds are waiting to bloom, necks are craned to crow." Luo Shiyang formed a small group of more than ten people. The steps of this small group's attack were: first, publicize the fallacies released by Zhang Naiqi, Li Kangnian, and others; second, collect attack materials and prepare tasks; third, comprehensively spread poison. The members of the small group had specific divisions of labor, and their purpose was to drive out public representatives and restore capitalism. The Wu Boshen and Wu Shuqing anti-Party family wanted to create a "Hungarian incident" and force the Communist Party to step down. They also put forward strategies for realizing this conspiracy. In Wu Shuqing's words, it was to be "both vicious and concealed."

    The rightists in various small cities are mostly pawns of the Zhang-Luo alliance. They faithfully implemented the instructions of the Zhang-Luo group. Zhou Dahong, a rightist in Fuzhou, privately convened countless secret meetings to spread Zhang Bojun's fallacies, mainly the following points: (1) American atomic bombs can destroy a quarter of the world's population. (2) The world will undergo great changes in the future (implying that socialism will disintegrate). (3) China has a large population and should not promote the advance towards science, otherwise, it will create a large number of unemployed people. (4) Promoting the American way of life. He said that these were all told to him personally by Zhang Bojun, emphasizing that it should be kept secret and not spread. Yao Hesheng from the traditional Chinese medicine field said that the leadership of the Communist Party is a "great obstacle." He claimed to be sick and did not go to work, but instead, saw patients at home to make money and put it in his own pocket. Yuan Jiuzhang, the deputy chief engineer of a certain mine, advocated "technical personnel managing enterprises." He said that the Party's leading cadres were "people who have no ability but hold high positions and take money." He compared himself to a dictionary, saying that the Party "doesn't know how to use the dictionary, and says it's bad even without knowing how to use it." Party members Shi Ming and Wei Xin, together with non-Party rightists, sang in chorus that "the decline of Jiangxi's literature and art stems from the Party's lack of understanding of literature and art."

    Most of these rightists are either historical counter-revolutionaries or die-hard class dissidents. They have great hatred for the Party and socialism. Now these rightists have been exposed, and some have confessed their crimes to the people.

    江西反右派斗争深入开展
    右派分子原形毕露有些已低头认罪
    本报讯　江西省反右派斗争向广、深、透方面发展。8月下旬以来，在工商界，医学界，教育界，文艺界，工程技术人员和小城市中，连续揭发出来一批穷凶极恶的右派分子，其中有工商界的罗时炀（民建南昌市委会副秘书长）、吴伯申、吴叔清，医学界的姚荷生（江西中医实验院副院长）、罗秉忠（南昌市第一医院矫外科主任），教育界的赵则平（南昌一中教员）、贲效育（南昌师专校长办公室主任），文艺界的矢明（江西群众艺术馆馆长）、魏新（江西省话剧团演员），工程技术人员中的袁九章（某矿山副总工程师），小城市的李树华（吉安市民革主委）、陶逸民（工商联全国执委）、何星南（上饶市民盟主委）、刘一燕（景德镇民盟主委）、周达洪（抚州市农工党主委）等。
    这些右派分子大都有组织、有计划、有纲领、有步骤、有策略地向党进攻，其中许多人是一个方面的“主将”或幕后指挥人。上饶市的右派分子何星南在整风运动初期，在知识分子中煽动地说党对知识分子“怀疑有余、尊重不足”，歪曲党团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策。景德镇市的右派分子刘一燕，一方面大放反共厥词，一方面还恶毒地煽惑说“含苞待放，引颈待鸣”，罗时炀组成了一个十几人的小集团。这个小集团的进攻步骤是：第一步宣传章乃器、李康年等所放出的谬论；第二步收集进攻材料，分工准备；第三步全面放毒。小集团的成员有具体分工，他们的目的是驱逐出公方代表，让资本主义复辟。吴伯申、吴叔清反党小家族要搞起一个“匈牙利事件”，要共产党下台。他们并提出实现这一阴谋的策略。用吴叔清的话说就是“既恶毒，又隐讳”。
    各小城市的右派分子大多是章罗联盟的爪牙。他们不折不扣地贯彻执行章罗集团的指示。抚州市右派分子周达洪私自召开无数次秘密会议传播章伯钧的谰言，主要传播以下几点：（1）美国的原子弹能毁灭世界人口的四分之一。（2）将来世界会起大变化（说社会主义要解体）。（3）中国人口多，不应提向科学进军，不然会造成大批人员失业。（4）宣扬美国的生活方式。他说这些都是章伯钧当面对他讲的，强调保守秘密不能外传。中医界姚荷生说共产党的领导是“莫大的阻力”。他托病不上班，却在家看门诊赚钱装进自己的荷包。身为某矿山的副总工程师的袁九章提倡“技术人员治企业”。说党的领导干部是“没有本领而高居要位拿钱的人”，他把自己比作字典，说党“不会用字典，不会用还说字典坏”。党内右派分子矢明、魏新与党外右派分子合唱“江西文艺衰颓，根源是党不懂文艺”。
    这些右派分子大多系历史反革命分子或死心踏地的阶级异己分子。对党对社会主义有很大仇恨。现在这些右派分子已原形毕露，有的已向人民伏罪。
