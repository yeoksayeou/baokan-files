Xinhua News Agency, September 26th. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will officially open to traffic on October 15th, and a completion and opening ceremony will be held on the same day. This news was announced by Wu Jingti, Vice Minister of Railways, at a press conference held today for Chinese and foreign journalists.

Wu Jingti said that the opening ceremony will be presided over by Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, and relevant departments of the State Council and responsible persons from relevant provinces and cities will be invited to participate. Because Soviet experts provided selfless technical assistance during the construction of the bridge, the Ministry of Railways has decided to invite representatives from the Soviet Ministry of Transport Engineering to attend the ceremony and will invite the Soviet Ambassador to China and the Soviet Chief Economic Advisor to attend the viewing.

At present, the Preparatory Committee for the Completion and Opening Ceremony of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been established, with Xie Ziqun, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, serving as the director, and is actively carrying out preparatory work.

    新华社26日讯　武汉长江大桥将在10月15日正式通车，同日举行落成通车典礼。这个消息是由铁道部副部长武竞天在今天举行的中外记者招待会上宣布的。
    武竞天说，通车典礼将由国务院副总理李富春主持，并将邀请国务院有关部门和有关省市的负责人参加。由于大桥施工过程中苏联专家在技术上给予了无私的援助，铁道部决定邀请苏联运输工程部派代表参加典礼，并将邀请苏联驻我国大使及苏联经济总顾问参加观礼。
    现在，武汉长江大桥的落成通车典礼筹备委员会已经成立，由武汉市副市长谢滋群担任主任委员，正在积极进行筹备工作。
