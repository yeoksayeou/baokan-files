    新疆生产部队第二十四农场
    精简机构　降低成本
    据新华社讯　新疆生产建设部队玛纳斯河流域垦区第二十四农场，今年增产节约成绩很好。
    这个农场在4月以前完成了三万多亩开荒任务，播种面积比原计划扩大一千一百九十五亩，预计可增产原粮二十万公斤、皮棉一万五千公斤。
    为了降低成本，农场很注意改进耕作技术，一般作业均保证一次做完，争取不返工。全场在机器、牲畜和人力使用上，减少了过多的作业层次和不必要的作业量，节省了相当于耕地三千亩、耙地三万亩、打埂二十万公尺的劳动力。全场还精简了一百七十名间接生产人员，使他们直接参加生产。此外，该场官兵决心做到今年节约行政办公费用30％，耗油定额降低10％到15％，饲料定额降低25％到30％。
