　　Hold Benefit Performances to Relieve Disaster Victims

　　From the end of August to the beginning of September, many cultural, artistic, and employee groups in Qingdao held multiple benefit performances, donating the proceeds from ticket sales to the people in the flood-stricken areas of Shandong Province.

　　The Qingdao Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Municipal Broadcasting Orchestra jointly held five disaster relief music and dance parties and two disaster relief film music evenings. In addition to holding continuous disaster relief dance parties, employees in the Shuiqinggou area of Qingdao also held two benefit performances featuring programs including Peking Opera, Lü Opera, folk art, and music. The Qingdao representatives who participated in the first Shandong Provincial Music Festival also performed all twenty-eight of their award-winning festival programs free of charge. The disaster relief concert held by the Qingdao Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in addition to performances by the Municipal Youth Association Amateur Orchestra, the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station Amateur Broadcasting Orchestra, and some amateur musicians, also specially invited Professor Manzek, a German cello expert who was recuperating locally, to participate in the performance. Professor Manzek is a well-known old musician who has taught at several music academies in China. Most of the famous cello players in China today were taught by him. Professor Manzek has not performed publicly for a long time, but when he heard that it was a benefit performance for disaster relief, he readily agreed to perform. In addition, the first graduating class of the Central Academy of Drama's Performance Department, a group of more than fifty people who were touring Qingdao, also performed a disaster relief benefit performance of four small classical comedies: "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "A Match Made in a Cupboard," "Beating the Flour Cylinder," and "The Proposal."

    举行义演救济灾民
    8月底9月初，青岛市不少文化艺术及职工团体多次举行义演，以所得票价捐献给山东省水灾区人民。
    青岛市中苏友好协会和市广播乐团联合举办了五次救灾音乐舞会、两次救灾电影音乐晚会。青岛市水清沟地区职工除连续举办救灾舞会外，还举办了包括京剧、吕剧、曲艺、音乐等节目的两场义演。参加山东省第一届音乐会演归来的青岛市代表，也把他们会演得奖的二十八个节目全部义务演出。青岛市文化艺术联合会举办的救灾音乐会，除由市青年会业余管弦乐队、市人民广播电台业余广播乐团等文艺团体及部分业余音乐工作者演出外，还特地邀请了正在当地休养的德国大提琴专家曼哲克教授参加演出。曼哲克教授是著名的老音乐家，曾先后在我国几个音乐院任教。现在我国所有著名的大提琴演奏家，大半曾受教于他门下。曼哲克教授久已不作公演，这次听说是救灾义演，慨然应允公演。此外，正在青岛市巡回演出的中央戏剧学院表演系首届毕业生一行五十余人，也以“拾玉镯”，“柜中缘”、“打面缸”、“求婚”四个小型古典喜剧进行了一场救灾义演。
