Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Yong reported in the Shaanxi Daily: How to make the anti-Rightist struggle develop in a balanced and in-depth way? The "joint struggle" method created by the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China provides experience and has achieved great results.

When the anti-Rightist struggle began, only four rightist elements were discovered in the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, and the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the eleven departments (committees) under the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and no rightist elements were exposed in the other eight departments. Because these departments were led by various business systems respectively and did not communicate with each other, the strength of the entire agency's anti-Rightist struggle appeared very scattered. At that time, the individual departments that had discovered rightist elements deeply felt that their manpower was insufficient and the struggle was weak. The other departments that had not discovered rightist elements had not received a vivid education in class struggle. Some cadres' understanding of the anti-Rightist struggle was still vague, and some even suspected whether the materials of the Organization Department's Kang Yu-guang were fully compiled.

In order to overcome these shortcomings, the party organization of the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee decided to establish a temporary leading group for the anti-Rightist struggle to determine unified command and joint operations. The method of operation was: first, change the method of decentralized leadership within the agency and form the departments (committees) into a unified combat unit. Then, take the department (committee) where the rightist elements are located as a unit for small-scale struggle to verify all the facts with the rightist elements. Then, according to the different specific circumstances of each rightist element, determine the number of "joint struggle" conferences to be held and the departments to participate. Before the meeting, the leading group printed and distributed the materials of the rightist elements to be struggled against to each cadre of each department (committee), and organized each department (committee) to conduct two or three discussions and criticisms within its own unit. In this way, after recognizing the ugly faces of the rightist elements, many cadres in departments that originally had no rightist elements clarified their past confused thoughts, took the initiative to draw a clear line between themselves and the rightist elements, and actively plunged into the anti-Rightist struggle. The Rural Work Department and the Culture and Education Department also sent cadres to the countryside and universities to collect materials to refute the reactionary remarks of Kang Yu-guang, a rightist element in the Organization Department. More than one hundred cadres from other departments also prepared joint speeches to refute the different arguments of the rightist elements. After more than a week of full preparation, the entire agency held a struggle meeting with more than 500 people participating, and representatives from other relevant municipal-level agencies were invited to participate. At the meeting, more than forty people from various departments spoke continuously and enthusiastically, focusing on criticizing Kang Yu-guang's fallacies. Because the disclosed materials were sufficient and the facts were conclusive, Kang Yu-guang's cunning denial aroused the anger of the masses even more. Under the step-by-step pursuit of the masses, Kang Yu-guang had to bow his head and confess his guilt, and admitted that he was convinced.

In this way, through the "joint struggle" against several rightist elements, the cooperation between the departments was strengthened, and all cadres were educated and trained. The rightist elements were completely isolated among the masses of the agency. Many people who had previously sympathized with the rightist elements are now actively participating in the struggle. A rightist element from the Municipal Youth League Committee who had resolutely refused to wear the "Rightist" hat in the past later took the initiative to admit that he was a rightist element, and also exposed another rightist element. A rightist element from the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs who was prepared to resist also expressed his willingness to surrender to the people. Many cadres in the United Front Work Department, the General Office, and other departments that had not previously discovered rightist elements also exposed the reactionary remarks of other rightist elements to the leading group. Due to the close cooperation of various departments, four more relatively hidden rightist elements have now been exposed. At present, this experience of "joint struggle" has been promoted in some municipal-level units in Xi'an.

### 推动反右派斗争平衡深入地开展  西安市委创造 “联合斗争”方法

    推动反右派斗争平衡深入地开展
    西安市委创造 “联合斗争”方法
    本报讯  陕西日报登载新华社记者王永报道：怎样使反右派斗争平衡深入地开展？中共西安市委会创造的“联合斗争”方法，提供了经验，并取得很大成效。
    当反右派斗争开始时，中共西安市委会所属十一个部（委）中，只在组织部、宣传部和直属机关党委三个部门发现了四个右派分子，其他八个部门并没有暴露出来。因为这些部门是由各业务系统分别领导，彼此互不联系。致使整个机关反右派斗争的力量显得很分散。当时已发现有右派分子的个别部门深感人力不足、斗争不力；而其他没有发现右派分子的部门因为没有受到生动的阶级斗争的教育，有些干部对反右派斗争的认识还很模糊，甚至有少数人怀疑组织部对右派分子亢郁光的材料整理得是否全面。
    为了克服这些缺点，中共西安市委会的机关党组织，决定成立反右派斗争临时领导小组，确定统一指挥、联合作战。作战的方法是：首先改变机关内部分散领导的方法，把各部（委）组成一个统一的作战单位。接着以右派分子所在的部（委）为单位进行小会斗争，和右派分子核对全部事实。然后根据各右派分子不同的具体情况，确定召开“联合斗争”大会的次数和参加的部门。会前由领导小组把准备斗争的右派分子的材料，印发给各部（委）的每个干部，组织各部（委）在本单位内部分别进行了两、三次讨论和批判。这样许多原来没有右派分子部门的干部，在认识右派分子的丑恶面目后，就澄清了过去的糊涂思想。主动地和右派分子划清界限，积极地投入了反右派斗争。农村工作部和文教部为了驳斥组织部右派分子亢郁光的反动言论，还专门派干部深入农村和高等学校去搜集材料，其他各部也有一百多个干部分别就右派分子的不同论点，准备了据理驳斥的联合发言。经过一个多星期的充分准备后，全机关就召开了有五百多人参加的斗争大会，并邀请了市级其他有关机关派代表参加。会上各部门有四十多个人连续踊跃地发言，集中批判右派分子亢郁光的谬论，由于揭露出的材料充分，事实确凿，因而右派分子亢郁光的狡猾抵赖，就更加激起群众的愤怒。在群众的步步追逼下，亢郁光不得不低头认罪，并且承认他已口服心服。
    这样经过对几个右派分子的“联合斗争”，加强了各部门之间的合作，并教育和锻炼了全体干部。右派分子就在机关群众中完全孤立起来了。许多过去对右派分子抱同情态度的人，现在也积极参加了斗争。团市委一个过去坚决不戴“右派”帽子的右派分子，后来也主动地承认自己是右派分子，并且还检举出另外的一个右派分子。直属机关党委一个准备顽抗的右派分子也自己表示要向人民交械投降。原来没有发现右派分子的统战部、办公厅等部门，许多干部也向领导小组揭发出了其他右派分子的反动言论，由于各部门的密切配合，现在又揭露出四个比较隐蔽的右派分子。目前，这种“联合斗争”的经验，已在西安市级部分单位中推行。
