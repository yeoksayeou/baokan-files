    “I do not admit…”
    ——The “Stubborn Art” of Anti-Party Elements
    Guyan
    Some anti-Party elements are accustomed to adopting a耍赖 (shuǎlài - acting shamelessly) attitude towards their past anti-Party activities. When the facts prove that their opposition to specific Party leaders is aimed at opposing the leadership of the Party, they say: I do not admit that this is opposing the leadership of the Party. When the facts prove that they are engaged in sectarian activities, they say: I do not admit to engaging in conspiracies or sectarianism. When the facts prove that they have betrayed and defected before the Japanese devils, traitors, and the Kuomintang, they say: I do not accept this conclusion (but that is not a conclusion, it is a fact). When the facts prove that they are morally degenerate scoundrels, they say: I do not admit that such a thing exists. In short, they have done all the bad things, but for every bad thing they have done, they say: I do not admit it…
    Facts are the most eloquent, because facts are real things, they are objectively existing. To face the facts and not admit that they exist, is this not closing your eyes and talking nonsense?
    When facing the facts, anti-Party elements say: I do not admit it… Their purpose is to deny the facts, but how can the facts be denied? The phrase “I do not admit…” unreservedly admits that some anti-Party elements are also stubborn elements in the face of facts. Therefore, "I do not admit..." has become the theoretical formula of anti-Party elements. The one who invented and uses this formula must be a stubborn element. Therefore, this formula is also the stubborn art or stubborn method of stubborn elements. These anti-Party elements can also be called "I do not admit-ists."
    The formula “I do not admit…” is very close to “the thief crying ‘stop thief’” and “burying silver three hundred taels here.” “The thief crying ‘stop thief’” attempts to take the opportunity to shift the target. "Burying silver three hundred taels here" only works when there is no definite evidence. Once the stolen goods and evidence are all present, one still has to admit that they are a thief. The Party’s investigation of anti-Party elements is not like the owner of lost property blindly chasing a thief, easily being deceived. "I do not admit-ists" are unable to shift the target onto others. However, "I do not admit-ists" are, after all, "writers." There is, after all, more "ingenuity" in their "souls" than in the "ingenuity" of thieves. They have learned the cunning of thieves, developed the cunning of thieves, and abandoned the honesty of thieves in the face of stolen goods. Thus, they created the formula "I do not admit..." but in essence, it is still the trickery of thieves.
    The赖 (lài - denying guilt) of "I do not admit-ists" is also诬赖 (wūlài - falsely accusing), taking denying guilt as defense, and taking falsely accusing as a counterattack. Behind "I do not admit..." there is also the subtext of "I admit..." What do they want to admit? Very obviously, since they "do not admit" the revealed facts, does that not mean that the accusations against them are "shooting without aim," that accusing them of engaging in sectarian activities is "sectarian attacks," that investigating their history and anti-Party activities is "political persecution," that criticism of them is "striking with one blow" and "making them stink!" Thus, using the "stubborn art" of "I do not admit..." they silently admit and affirm that the words they said in the past when attacking the Party were "correct." Anti-Party elements attempt to use the "stubborn art" of "I do not admit..." to prevent further exposure and investigation of them. At the same time, this is also a false accusation against those who expose them and a counterattack against the Party. One of the past crimes of anti-Party elements was being disloyal to the Party, and the creation of the formula "I do not admit..." precisely adds new evidence to their crime of disloyalty to the Party.
    How stubborn is the stubbornness of anti-Party elements!
    However, facts are more powerful than artificial stubbornness. The more facts that are revealed, the smaller the stubborn force of artificial stubbornness becomes. Facts are the most powerful iron hammer for crushing the stubbornness of anti-Party elements.
    Anti-Party elements think that they can get away with it by relying on the "stubborn art" of "I do not admit..." they created. In fact, on the contrary, this is a stumbling block that they have brought upon themselves. They must drive out what they have brought upon themselves, otherwise they will never pass the socialist barrier.

    “我不承认……”
     ——反党分子的“顽固术”
    孤烟
    有的反党分子，对他过去所干的反党勾当，惯于采取耍赖的态度。事实证明了他反对具体的党的领导人的目的就是反对党的领导，他则说：我不承认这是反对党的领导。事实证明了他搞宗派活动，他则说：我不承认是搞阴谋搞宗派。事实证明了他曾经在日本鬼子、汉奸、国民党面前叛变过，变节过，他则说：我不承认这种结论（但那不是结论，是事实）。事实证明了他是道德堕落的恶棍，他则说：我不承认有这种事。总之，坏事被他们干尽了，可是对每一件自己干过的坏事，他们都说：我不承认……
    事实是最雄辩的，因为事实就是实在的事，是客观存在着的。面对着事实而不承认它是存在着的，这不是闭着眼睛说瞎话么？
    反党分子在事实面前说：我不承认……，目的是想赖掉事实，可是，事实怎么能赖掉呢。“我不承认……”这句话不折不扣地承认了有的反党分子在事实的面前又是顽固分子，因此，“我不承认……”就成了反党分子的理论公式，发明和使用这个公式的一定是顽固分子，因此，这公式也就是顽固分子的顽固术或顽固法，这种反党分子也可以称为“我不承认论者”。
    “我不承认……”的公式很近乎“贼喊捉贼”和“此地无银三百两”。“贼喊捉贼”是希图借机转移目标，“此地无银三百两”只有在事无确证之下才行的通，一旦赃证俱在，还是不得不承认自己是贼。党对反党分子的追查，不像失主的盲目追贼，易被瞒过。“我不承认论者”是无法把目标转移到别人身上去的。然而，“我不承认论者”究竟是“作家”，他们“灵魂”里究竟比贼的“机智”多，他们学来了贼的狡猾，发展了贼的狡猾，抛弃了贼在赃证面前的老实，于是创造了“我不承认……”的公式，但骨子里仍然是贼的伎俩。
    “我不承认论者”的赖也是诬赖，以赖为守，以诬赖为反攻。“我不承认……”的背后还有“我承认……”的潜台词。他们要承认的是什么呢？很显然，既然“不承认”已揭发出的事实，那么，岂不等于说对他们的揭发是“无的放矢”么，说他们是宗派活动岂不是“宗派打击”么，审查他们的历史和反党活动岂不是“政治陷害”么，对他们的批评岂不是“一棍子打死”，把他们“搞得很臭”么！于是用“我不承认……”的“顽固术”就默默地承认了肯定了他们过去向党进攻时说的那些话是“正确的”。反党分子企图用“我不承认……”的“顽固术”阻挡着对他们继续的揭发和追查，同时这也是对揭发者的诬赖，是对党的反攻。反党分子过去反党的罪状之一就是对党的不忠实，而“我不承认……”的公式的创造，恰恰给他们不忠实于党的罪状增添了新的例证。
    反党分子的顽固性多么顽固！
    然而，事实比人为的顽固性更有力，事实揭露的越多，人为的顽固性的顽固力就越小，事实是粉碎反党分子的顽固性最有力的铁锤。
    反党分子以为靠他们创造的“我不承认……”的顽固术可以混过关去。其实，恰恰相反，这是他们给自己招来的拦路鬼。自己招来的还要自己打出去的，否则永不能过社会主义的关。
