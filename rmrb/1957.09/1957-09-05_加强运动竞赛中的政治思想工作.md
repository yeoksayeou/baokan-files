Strengthen Political and Ideological Work in Sports Competitions
*People's Daily* Commentator

    In recent years, sports in our country have developed extremely rapidly. On the basis of the widespread mass sports movement, many excellent athletes have emerged, whose technical level has improved rapidly, and whose sportsmanship has also been praised. However, in some domestic or international sports competitions this year, some undesirable phenomena have also been discovered, such as crude actions, disobedience to referees, and booing by spectators, which have aroused dissatisfaction and censure among the broad masses of people.

    The reason for these undesirable phenomena is mainly that the publicity and education work in sports competitions is not done well enough, and some political propaganda work has not been well integrated with specific situations and problems. In order to better continue to carry out mass sports activities, correctly conduct sports competitions, and consolidate and improve technical levels, it is necessary to strengthen the publicity and education work in sports competitions and earnestly improve the methods of political and ideological work. First of all, it is necessary to continue to educate the broad masses of athletes to recognize the nature and tasks of sports in our country. Constantly, repeatedly, and through various specific activities, make them aware of the glory and responsibility of being an athlete. Sports in our country are an integral part of the socialist cultural cause and a means of conducting communist education among the people. The purpose of developing sports is to improve the health of the people and enhance their physical fitness in order to better serve production and national defense. We must resolutely oppose the corrupt bourgeois thoughts and behaviors such as speculation, retaliation, and "championship-ism." Overcome the phenomenon of being divorced from social life and the masses. Raise the ideological consciousness of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism. Study diligently and practice hard, and combine the improvement of personal skills, the ability to cooperate tacitly, and the brave and tenacious fighting style well. Serve the development of mass sports activities and win glory for the motherland.

    Secondly, correctly carry out education on participating in sports competitions. Sports competitions are to review the results of usual training, exchange experiences with each other, in order to continue to promote and improve the development of sports. Athletes should prepare well before the competition, give full play to their skills during the competition, correctly use tactics, be brave, tenacious, alert, calm, and strive for victory. It is by no means simply to win "championships." If praised and rewarded, never be arrogant, should help the other party, sincerely exchange experiences, not only put forward their own experiences for the other party to refer to, but also learn from the experience of the defeated party. If criticized and condemned, do not be discouraged, as long as you sum up experience, learn from the advantages of the other party, and continue to work hard, you will inevitably be able to strive for victory; regard all praise or criticism as the driving force to encourage yourself to move forward.

    Referees must be respected and obeyed. All team leaders, coaches, athletes, or people in charge of competitions must do so during the competition. The audience should also do so. This is not only an absolutely necessary discipline, but also the politeness that should be shown to referees. It is not allowed to blame, pester, or disobey on the spot, and even more intolerable to insult or beat the referee (if there is any insult or beating behavior, it should be subject to disciplinary sanctions). If some judgments of the referee are unclear, the captain can kindly ask questions. After the referee's explanation, whether or not you agree, you must implement the referee's decision. In refereeing work, it is inevitable that there will be individual negligence and misjudgment. This kind of mistake also exists in any other work. It should be raised after the game through certain ways to seek reasonable solutions. At the same time, it is also necessary to improve the level of refereeing work, requiring referees to be fair and strict, and actively and responsibly carry out their tasks. Refereeing staff are the organizers and leaders of a competition, undertaking the trust of the competition, athletes and the broad masses of spectators, and should make the competition complete. The quality of the referee directly affects the athletes' skills, style, and the audience's emotions. At present, the refereeing staff in our country are active and hardworking. Knowledge and experience are also constantly improving and enriching. However, due to the universal development of sports and the continuous improvement of sports skills, the number of referees is insufficient, and knowledge and experience cannot keep up with the needs. It is necessary to require relevant parties to strengthen the training and assistance to referees; to require referees to study hard, sum up experience, and improve their work level. It is necessary to criticize the emotions of leniency and partiality among referees, resolutely maintain the dignity of rules and discipline, fight against all unreasonable behaviors, and better complete their glorious and solemn tasks.

    In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen on-site education for the audience. The audience in our country is enthusiastic, fair, and has good organizational discipline. In many competitions, they have played a very good role in encouraging athletes. Foreign guests who have visited our country have also left a deep and good impression. However, in some competitions, some viewers were also found to be not calm. Such as surrounding referees, surrounding athletes, etc., this phenomenon should be corrected. If the audience has any opinions, they can be put forward to the unit in charge of the competition, to the referees, to the sports teams and athletes after the event, asking them to continue to make progress. Absolutely must not show unreasonable actions on the spot. We must criticize those remnants of improper behavior brought about by the old society, and cultivate and establish the spirit of unity, friendship, and kindness to people. The audience must also ensure the smooth progress of the competition and promote the normal development of sports in our country.

    All sports work leaders must pay close attention to political and ideological education work, personally take action, check and improve the content and methods of ideological education. Those practices that only make general calls, but do not give specific instructions; only raise questions, but do not study methods to solve problems; only make demands, but do not help solve the difficulties of practical work; only hand it over to the lower levels to do, and do not personally think of ways to summarize and check, must be corrected. Our athletes are generally young, and their political and technical training is not enough. They are willing to make progress, and they ask for learning and help. As long as everyone pays attention to political and ideological education work and gets to work, new achievements will definitely be achieved.

    In the future, domestic and international sports competition activities will be carried out more and more. It is hoped that these activities will be carried out better and more perfectly.

    加强运动竞赛中的政治思想工作本
    本报评论员
    近几年，我国体育运动发展极为迅速。在广泛开展的群众体育运动基础上，出现了许多优秀运动员，他们的技术水平提高很快，运动道德作风也受到赞誉。但是，在今年一些国内或国际性的运动竞赛中，也发现了动作粗野，不服从裁判，观众起哄等不良现象，引起了广大人民的不满和责难。
    产生这些不良现象的原因，主要是运动竞赛的宣传教育工作做得不够，有些政治宣传工作没有很好地结合具体情况和问题进行。为了更好地继续开展群众性体育运动，正确地进行运动竞赛，巩固和提高技术水平，必须加强运动竞赛的宣传教育工作，切实改进政治思想工作方法。首先，应该继续教育广大运动员认清我国体育运动的性质和任务。经常地、反复地、通过各种具体活动，使他们知道作为一个运动员的光荣和责任。我国体育运动是社会主义文化事业的组成部分，是向人民群众进行共产主义教育的手段。发展体育运动的目的是为了改善人民健康状况，增强人民体质，以便更好地为生产和国防服务。必须坚决反对那种投机取巧，打击报复，“锦标主义”等腐朽的资产阶级的思想和行为。克服脱离社会生活，脱离群众的现象。提高爱国主义、集体主义和社会主义的思想觉悟。勤学苦练，将提高个人技术、善于合作默契和勇敢顽强战斗的作风很好结合起来。为开展群众性的体育运动服务，为祖国争取荣誉。
    其次，正确地进行关于参加运动竞赛的教育。运动竞赛是检阅平时锻炼成绩，互相交流经验，以便继续促进和提高体育运动的发展。运动员应该在竞赛前作好准备，临场比赛时充分发挥自己的技术，正确的运用战术，勇敢、顽强、机警、沉着，努力争取胜利。绝不是单纯地为了夺取“锦标”。受到表扬和奖励，绝不能骄傲，应该帮助对方，诚恳地交流经验，不仅将自己的经验提出供对方参考，也可以从失败的对方学习经验。受到批评和谴责，也不气馁，只要总结经验，学习对方的优点，继续努力，必然可以争取胜利；将一切表扬或批评都作为鼓舞自己前进的力量。
    对裁判员必须尊重，服从。所有的领队、指导、运动员或主持竞赛的人员，在比赛中都必须如此。观众也应如此。这不仅是绝对必要的纪律，也是对裁判员应有的礼貌。不能允许当场责难、纠缠、不服从，更不能容忍侮辱、殴打裁判的行为（如有侮辱、殴打行为，应受纪律制裁）。对裁判员的某些判决不明了，可以由队长善意的提出询问。经裁判员说明后，无论是否同意，都必须执行裁判的决定。在裁判工作中，难免有个别疏忽和误判，这种失误，在其他任何工作中也是存在的，应该在比赛后经过一定方式提出，求得合理解决。同时，也要提高裁判工作水平，要求裁判员公正严明，积极负责的执行任务。裁判工作人员是一场竞赛的组织者和领导者，承担了主持竞赛方面、运动员和广大观众的信托，应该使竞赛完满地进行。裁判的好坏，直接影响运动员的技术、作风，以及观众情绪。目前，我国裁判工作人员是积极努力的。知识和经验也在不断提高和丰富。但是由于体育运动的普遍发展，运动技术不断提高，裁判员数量已经不足，知识、经验赶不上需要。必须要求有关方面加强对裁判员的培养和帮助；要求裁判员努力学习，总结经验，提高工作水平。要批判裁判员中那些姑息、偏袒情绪，坚决维护规则和纪律的尊严，向一切不合理的行为作斗争，更好地完成自己光荣而严肃的任务。
    此外，还要加强临场对观众的教育。我国观众是热情的、公正的，组织性纪律性也好。在许多次竞赛中对运动员都起了很好的鼓舞作用。来我国访问的外宾也留下了深刻而良好的印象。但是在有些比赛中，也发现有些观众不冷静。如包围裁判、包围运动员等，这种现象是应该改正的。观众如有意见，可以在事后向主持竞赛的单位，向裁判员，向运动队和运动员提出，要求他们继续进步。决不能当场表现无理的行动。必须批判由旧社会带来的那些残存的不正当的行为，培养和树立团结、友好与人为善的精神。观众也要保证竞赛的顺利进行，促进我国体育运动的正常发展。
    要求所有的体育工作领导人，必须切实注意政治思想教育工作，亲自动手，检查和改进思想教育的内容和方法。那种只作一般号召，不作具体指示；只提问题，不研究解决问题的方法；只提要求，不帮助解决实际工作的困难；只交给下级去作，自己不动手想办法总结检查的作法，都必须改正。我们的运动员一般是年青的，政治上、技术上锻炼都不够。他们是愿意进步的，他们要求学习和帮助。只要大家重视政治思想教育工作，动起手来，一定能够获得新的成绩。
    今后国内外运动竞赛活动日益开展，希望这些活动进行得更好，更完善。
