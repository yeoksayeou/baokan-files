　　Dreaming of Organizing a "Grand International Relations Department" to Peddle Bourgeois Legal Thought
　　Wang Tieyai's Conspiracy to Pull the Wool Over People's Eyes Utterly Bankrupt
　　(Our Newspaper News) Rightist Wang Tieyai (Professor at Peking University) was extremely active during the rectification campaign, stirring up trouble everywhere and launching a frantic attack against the Party. He echoed rightists Qian Duansheng and Lou Bangyan, describing the higher education led by the Party since liberation as "pitch black." In addition to viciously attacking the restructuring of departments, the Party's policy towards intellectuals, and the Party's cadre policy, he also arrogantly clamored that "international law science in China has been interrupted for seven years," and that the science of private international law "faces a great crisis and is on the verge of extinction," and that "the teaching and scientific research cadre training of international law has been basically a failure in recent years, although there have been some achievements, but the shortcomings outweigh the achievements."
　　The reason why Wang Tieyai so vigorously attacked and smeared our higher education work and the research work of international law was to realize his conspiracy of the "Grand International Relations Department."
　　According to Wang Tieyai's "Grand International Relations Department" conspiracy plan, the first step was to "thoroughly rectify" the schools related to international relations and foreign affairs in New China and merge them into one. He proposed merging the relevant departments of the Foreign Affairs Institute, Renmin University, and the Institute of International Relations of the Academy of Sciences into Peking University to establish a "Grand International Relations Department," with himself as the head of the department, and without the leadership of the government.
　　According to Wang Tieyai's "Grand International Relations Department" plan, the second step was to abolish the leadership of the Party. He strongly opposed the Party committee system, advocating so-called "professors managing the school," and he also strongly opposed arranging one or several Party members in each position. He said this was "sectarianism." In order to exclude the leadership of the Party, he recruited troops and bought horses everywhere, wanting old legal scholars who shared his views to "return to the team," and tried his best to win over his favorite student, rightist Xue Mouhong, Zhou Ren, and others to teach in his "Grand International Relations Department."
　　According to Wang Tieyai's "Grand International Relations Department" plan, the third step was to restore the old legal thought. He proposed abolishing courses such as "People's Democratic State Law" and listing courses such as "Soviet State Law" as electives. And to teach bourgeois state law according to the way it was taught before liberation. He also wanted the teachers under his leadership to use the works of the imperialist comprador scholar Zhang Zhongfu as basic teaching materials when preparing "Chinese Diplomatic History."
  It can be seen that the purpose of Wang Tieyai's organization of the so-called "Grand International Relations Department" was to restore bourgeois legal thought and destroy socialist legal thought.
　　Wang Tieyai's anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities were not accidental. This was not only because he was born into a bureaucrat family and received bourgeois imperialist enslaved education from an early age, but also according to the materials that have been revealed, he was also a complete political broker. After returning from England, he constantly colluded with Wang Huacheng, the director of the pseudo-Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and with Wu Guozhen, the deputy minister of the pseudo-Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
　　In the early days of liberation, on the one hand, he burrowed into the leadership core of the Diplomatic Association, and on the other hand, he attempted to use the diplomatic group of the Political Department of Peking University, which he had organized before liberation, as a base for training his diplomatic personnel. Now, Wang Tieyai's anti-Party conspiracy has been completely bankrupt.

### 梦想组织“大国际关系系”贩运资产阶级法学  王铁崖偷天换日的阴谋彻底破产

　　梦想组织“大国际关系系”贩运资产阶级法学
　　王铁崖偷天换日的阴谋彻底破产
    本报讯　右派分子王铁崖（北京大学教授）在整风期间大肆活跃，到处煽风、点火，向党展开了猖狂的进攻。他和右派分子钱端升、楼邦彦互相呼应，把解放后党领导的高等教育说成“漆黑一团”。他除了恶毒地攻击院系调整、党对知识分子政策和党的干部政策以外，他还狂妄自大地叫嚣着什么“国际法科学在中国已经中断了七年”，国际私法这门科学“面临极大危机，快到绝种的境地”，“国际法的教学和科学研究干部的培养，这几年来基本是失败的，虽然有些成绩，但是缺点是大于成绩的。”
    王铁崖之所以如此大肆攻击和污蔑我们的高等教育工作和国际法的研究工作，原来他是为了实现他的“大国际关系系”的阴谋。
    按照王铁崖的“大国际关系系”阴谋计划，首先是要把新中国的有关国际关系和外交业务方面的学校“彻底整顿”，合而为一。他提出要把外交学院、人民大学及科学院国际关系研究所有关部门，都合并到北京大学来，成立一个“大国际关系系”，由他自己做系主任，不要政府来领导。
    按照王铁崖的“大国际关系系”方案，第二是取消党的领导。他极力反对党委制，主张所谓“教授治校”，他还极力反对每个岗位上，都安排一个或几个党员。他说这就是“宗派主义”。为了排斥党的领导，他就到处招兵买马，要臭味相投的旧法学人员“归队”，极力拉拢他的得意门生右派分子薛谋洪、周仁等人，到他的“大国际关系系”任教。
    按照王铁崖的“大国际关系系”方案，第三是恢复旧法学。他提出取消“人民民主国家法”等课程，把“苏联国家法”等课程列为选修。并要把资产阶级国家法照解放前的讲法讲。他还要他领导下的教师在准备“中国外交史”时，应把帝国主义买办学者张忠绂的著作作为基本教材。
  由此可见王铁崖组织所谓“大国际关系系”的目的就在于恢复资产阶级法学，搞垮社会主义法学。
    王铁崖进行反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，并不是偶然的，这不仅由于他出身于官僚家庭，从小受资产阶级帝国主义奴化教育，而且据已揭发出来的材料，他还是一个十足的政治掮客。他从英国回来以后，他和伪外交部司长王化成，而且和伪外交部次长吴国桢不断勾搭。
    解放初期，他一方面钻进外交学会的领导核心，另一方面又妄图把他在解放前即组织好的北大政治系外交组，作为培养他的外交人员的基地。现在，王铁崖的反党阴谋已经彻底破产了。
