Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 31st - According to the German News Agency, to date, nearly four hundred private factories in the German Democratic Republic have state capital participation. By the end of June this year, nine hundred and thirty-nine private factory owners across the German Democratic Republic had applied for state capital to participate in their enterprises. This figure accounts for 8% of the total number of existing private factories in the German Democratic Republic. More than five hundred applications have been approved by the various state committees, and the rest are still under consideration.

By the end of June 1957, the number of enterprises with state capital participation for one year or more had increased to 390. State appropriations to these enterprises totaled 59.7 million marks. State capital accounts for an average of 45% of the total capital in these enterprises. 40% of these factories belong to the light industry sector. Some factories also produce important means of production, such as machine tools, instruments and compressors, parts for vehicles and agricultural machinery, bricks, concrete products, light building steel sheets and other items.

These enterprises with state capital participation clearly demonstrate their superiority. The output of these enterprises in the first half of 1957 increased by 20% compared to the same period last year; while the output of other private enterprises increased by only 11%.

    民主德国合营企业不断增多
    全国又有近千私营工厂申请公私合营
    据新华社柏林31日电  据德意志通讯社报道，到目前为止，民主德国已经有将近四百家私营工厂有国家资本参加。到今年6月底，民主德国全国有九百三十九个私营工厂厂主申请国家资本参加他们的企业。这个数字占民主德国现有私营工厂总数的8％。其中有五百多份申请书已经得到国家各委员会的批准，其余仍然在考虑中。
    到1957年6月底，有国家资本参加一年或一年以上的企业的数量已经增加到三百九十家。国家对这些企业的拨款共达五千九百七十万马克。国家资本在这些企业的总资本中平均占45％。这些工厂有40％是属于轻工业部门的。也有一部分工厂生产重要生产资料，如工作母机、仪器和压缩机、车辆和农业机器的零件、砖瓦、混凝土制品、轻型建筑钢板和其他物品。
    这些有国家资本参加的企业明显地表现了它们的优越性。这些企业的产量在1957年上半年比上年同期增加了20％；而其余私营企业的产量只增加了11％。
