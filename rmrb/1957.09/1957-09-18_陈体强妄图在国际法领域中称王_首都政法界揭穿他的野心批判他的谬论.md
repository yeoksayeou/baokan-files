Xinhua News Agency, September 17th:

　　A symposium held today by legal circles in the capital exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of Chen Tiqiang and Wang Tieya, rightist elements and political ambitious individuals in scholars' clothing, thoroughly revealing their conspiracy to usurp leadership over the science of international law.

　　Meng Yongqian, Director of the Institute of International Relations of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, first exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of Chen Tiqiang, a researcher at the Institute of International Relations and a rightist element. Meng Yongqian said that Chen Tiqiang was not an activist in the various movements after liberation, but when the rightists rampantly attacked the Communist Party, he became an activist who took the lead in starting fires. He incited others to attack the Party and told those who made suggestions to focus their attacks on the Party branch secretary. At a symposium held at the Institute of International Relations in late May and early June, rightists Chen Tiqiang, Tian Baosheng, and Chen Gongzhuo launched a signature campaign, preparing to write a letter to the upcoming National People's Congress meeting. That letter was an anti-Party document, and under the guise of opposing the so-called special treatment for senior cadres, they vilified the Party as an "anti-people, pleasure-seeking feudal privileged class." On June 7th, at a symposium in legal circles, he attacked our country's constitution and fundamental system, negated our country's achievements in international law over the past few years, and maliciously propagated that "there is a crisis in international law, and the scientific level is pathetically low," attempting to seize leadership of international law studies from the Party and restore bourgeois jurisprudence.

　　Meng Yongqian also said that Chen Tiqiang's anti-communist activities in the field of international law had his own set of political lines, organizational lines, and cadre policies, that is, a program, a plan, and steps. Chen Tiqiang prostrated himself before bourgeois international law and consistently adhered to a bourgeois, anti-socialist stance. Chen Tiqiang's statement that our country's "international law studies are in crisis, and the scientific level is pathetically low" is not in accordance with the facts. After World War II, due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, China played an increasingly important role in international affairs. In the international arena, it is imperialism that opposes us. Based on the solidarity of the socialist camp, we strive to unite nationalism and the peaceful neutral countries, and strive to unite the peace-loving people of all countries to isolate imperialism. In this struggle, our international relations must be arranged according to this fighting direction, and we cannot simply copy the history of past international relations and international law standards, because those were made and written by the bourgeois world. Over the past eight years, we have made great achievements in this area, and there have been many new creations. The practice of our country's international relations over the past eight years has been carried out on the basis of socialist principles, and there are many valuable experiences that should be well summarized and affirmed from a legal standpoint. This will only enrich and replenish our country's international law studies; where does this crisis come from?

　　Meng Yongqian also said that an important step for Chen Tiqiang to usurp leadership of international law studies was to re-concentrate those who had engaged in bourgeois international law studies in the past, making them a force he could rely on. This involves the issue of departmental adjustments. Chen Tiqiang actively supported Qian Duansheng's proposed "readjustment of departments," supported Qian Duansheng's plan for a large law school without Communist Party leadership, and Wang Tieya's plan for a large department of international relations. Chen Tiqiang supported Wang Tieya on the one hand, and on the other hand, had his own plan to compete for leadership in international law. After Chen Tiqiang took office as the leader of the International Law Group at the Institute of International Relations, he has been trying to control the International Law Group as his personal political capital and an anti-Party stronghold. Chen Tiqiang is the Deputy Secretary-General of the Political Science and Law Society, and he tried to establish an International Law Group in the Political Science and Law Society, and also wanted to establish an International Law Association separately. At a symposium in legal circles, he openly said: "Our country's international contacts are becoming more and more frequent. Who can be sent to the United Nations and the International Court of Justice in the future? We cannot only send old cadres based on their stance, but should send some insiders who cannot telegraph back to the country for instructions during meetings and must have the ability to make decisive decisions on the spot." Chen Tiqiang's arrogant personal political ambition is fully exposed in these few words.

　　He Wushuang, Vice President of the Foreign Affairs College, pointed out in his speech that while attacking the new China's science of international law, Chen Tiqiang also attacked the young cadres who engaged in the teaching of international law after liberation and the Renmin University of China and the Foreign Affairs College that trained these cadres. Under the guise of opposing sectarianism, Chen Tiqiang cited some so-called "facts," saying that the young people from the Renmin University of China and the Foreign Affairs College monopolized the teaching of international law and related work. He Wushuang said that this is not in accordance with the facts. After liberation, some old experts worked in state organs, and some experts continued to engage in international law research or teaching. Take Northeast Renmin University, which Chen Tiqiang attacked, for example; the old experts there were not, as Chen Tiqiang said, "not teaching courses." As far as we know, there is a professor there who serves as the leader of the international law teaching and research group and is responsible for part of the teaching work. He Wushuang said that Chen Tiqiang distorted the facts in order to maliciously attack the Communist Party.

　　Zhang Zhirang, Vice President of the Political Science and Law Society, and directors Yan Baohang and Zhou Gengsheng also spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Zhou Gengsheng focused on criticizing Chen Tiqiang's fallacies in attacking the Party in the science of international law. He said that Chen Tiqiang, proceeding from bourgeois individualism, was hostile to the new force of international law studies cultivated by the state. Chen Tiqiang also touted himself as an "insider" in international law, negating the role of old cadres. Zhou Gengsheng said that Chen Tiqiang's fallacies regarding international law show that he is maliciously dissatisfied with the status quo. Zhou Gengsheng asked Chen Tiqiang to deeply repent and thoroughly reform.

　　Chen Tiqiang made a self-criticism at the meeting. In his self-criticism, he only wore the hat of a rightist element, but did not confess to specific activities such as usurping leadership of international law studies. Legal circles who participated in the symposium expressed dissatisfaction with Chen Tiqiang's empty self-criticism and wrote notes asking him to confess his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance and the rightist Qian Duansheng.

　　Rui Mu, professor at Peking University and director of the Political Science and Law Society, said that when criticizing Chen Tiqiang, we cannot help but mention another rightist Wang Tieya (professor at Peking University), because they boasted, "Now, we are the only two who are engaged in international law." Rui Mu said that Wang Tieya has always denied the Party spirit and class nature of the science of international law. On the contrary, he advocated translating a large number of bourgeois international law works. Wang Tieya also shouted that the science of international law was "extinct" in China, obliterating our country's achievements in establishing legal science over the past eight years, and said that the Communist Party cannot lead law and international legal science, attempting to usurp the Communist Party's leadership in international legal science. When the Communist Party was carrying out rectification, his ugly face and ambition were fully exposed. He conspired to establish a "large department of international relations" that was not under the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also maliciously slandered the leaders of the political and legal departments, saying that "the political and legal circles are conservative and have a closed-door mentality" and that "the Communist Party uses the excuse of strong class nature to monopolize the political and legal circles."

　　The capital legal circles symposium will continue to be held.

### 陈体强妄图在国际法领域中称王  首都政法界揭穿他的野心批判他的谬论

　　陈体强妄图在国际法领域中称王
　　首都政法界揭穿他的野心批判他的谬论
    据新华社17日讯　首都法学界座谈会今天揭露和批判了披着学者外衣的政治野心家、右派分子陈体强、王铁崖的反动言行，彻底揭穿了他们企图篡夺国际法科学领导权的阴谋。
    中国科学院国际关系研究所所长孟用潜首先对国际关系研究所研究员、右派分子陈体强的反动言行进行揭露和批判。孟用潜说，陈体强在解放后历次运动中都不是积极分子，而在右派猖狂向共产党进攻的时候，他却成了带头点火的积极分子。他鼓动别人向党进攻，并且告诉提意见的人要集中攻击党的支部书记。5月底6月初在国际关系研究所的座谈会上，右派分子陈体强、田保生、陈公倬发动一个签名运动，准备写信给那时即将开的全国人民代表大会会议，那封信是一个反党文件，他们在反对所谓高级干部特殊待遇的借口下，将党丑化成一个“反人民的、追逐享乐的封建特权阶级”。6月7日，他在法学界座谈会上攻击我国的宪法和国家的根本制度，否定我国几年来在国际法方面的成就，恶意宣传“国际法存在有危机，科学水平低得可怜”，企图向党夺取国际法学的领导权，使资产阶级法学复辟。
    孟用潜又说，陈体强在国际法学方面的反共活动有他自己一套政治路线、组织路线和干部政策，也就是有纲领、有计划、有步骤的。陈体强对于资产阶级国际法学是五体投地的，他一贯坚持资产阶级的、反社会主义的立场。陈体强说我国的“国际法学存在有危机，科学水平低得可怜”，是不符事实的。二次大战后，由于中国革命的胜利，中国在国际事务中起着日益重大的作用。在国际上同我们敌对的是帝国主义。我们以社会主义阵营的团结为基础，争取团结民族主义和和平中立国家，争取团结各国爱好和平的人民，以孤立帝国主义。在这个斗争中，我们的国际关系一定要按这个战斗方向安排，不能照抄以往的国际关系的历史和国际法标准。因为那是资产阶级世界做出来和写出来的。八年来，我们在这方面取得很大的成就，也有不少新的创举。八年来我国国际关系的实践都是在社会主义原则基础上进行的，其中有很多宝贵的经验应该很好地加以总结，并从法理上加以肯定。这只会丰富和充实我国的国际法学，那里来的危机呢？
    孟用潜又说，陈体强篡夺国际法学领导权的重要步骤是将过去搞资产阶级国际法学的人重新集中起来，成为他可以依靠的一个力量。这就涉及到院系调整问题。陈体强积极支持钱端升提出的“院系再调整”，支持钱端升的不要共产党领导的大法学院计划和王铁崖的大国际关系系计划。陈体强一面支持王铁崖，一面在争夺国际法的领导方面另有一套计划。陈体强到国际关系研究所担任国际法组长后，一直企图把持国际法组作为他个人的政治资本和反党的据点。陈体强是政法学会的副秘书长，企图在政法学会成立国际法组，还想另外成立一个国际法协会。在法学界座谈会上，他公然说：“我国国际联系日益频繁，将来联合国、国际法院能派谁去？不能只凭立场而派老干部，应派一些内行的人去，在那里不能在开会时打电报回国请示，要有当机立断的能力”。陈体强狂妄的个人政治野心在这几句话里暴露得十分明显。
    外交学院副院长何戊双在发言中指出陈体强在攻击新中国国际法科学的同时，还攻击了解放后从事国际法教学工作的年轻干部和培养这些干部的中国人民大学和外交学院。陈体强以反对宗派主义为幌子，举出一些所谓“事实”，说中国人民大学和外交学院的年轻人，垄断了国际法的教学工作以及有关的工作。何戊双说，这是不符事实的。解放后，有一些老专家在国家机关中工作，有一些专家继续从事国际法的研究工作或做教学工作。就拿陈体强攻击的东北人民大学来看，那里的老专家不是像陈体强所说的那样“没有开课”，据我们所知，在那里有一位教授担任国际法教研组的组长，并担任一部分讲授工作。何戊双说，陈体强歪曲事实，是为了恶意攻击共产党。
    政法学会副会长张志让，理事阎宝航、周鲠生，国际关系研究员李浩培也在会上发言。周鲠生在发言中着重地批判了陈体强在国际法科学方面向党进攻的谬论。他说，陈体强从资产阶级个人主义出发，敌视国家培养的国际法学的新生力量。陈体强还推崇自己是国际法的“内行”，否定老干部的作用。周鲠生说，陈体强对于国际法所发出的谬论，可以看出他是恶意地对现状不满。周鲠生要陈体强深切悔悟，彻底改造。
    陈体强在会上作了检讨。他在检讨中只戴了右派分子的帽子，但没有交代篡夺国际法学领导权等方面的具体活动。参加座谈的法学界人士对陈体强的空洞检讨表示不满，纷纷写条子要他交代他和章罗联盟以及右派分子钱端升的关系。
    北京大学教授、政法学会理事芮沐说，在批判陈体强时，不能不同时提到另一个右派分子王铁崖（北京大学教授），因为他们自吹“现在搞国际法的只有我们两人”。芮沐说，王铁崖一贯否定国际法科学的党性阶级性，相反的，他主涨大量翻译资产阶级国际法的著作。王铁崖还叫喊国际法科学在中国“绝种”了，抹煞我国八年来建立法律科学的成就，并说共产党不能领导法学和国际法律科学，企图篡夺共产党在国际法律科学方面的领导权。到了共产党整风的时候，他的丑恶面目和野心全部暴露出来。他阴谋计划成立一个不要外交部领导的“大国际关系系”。他还恶意污蔑政法部门的领导，说“政法界保守，有关门主义”，“共产党借口阶级性强，垄断政法界”。
    首都法学界座谈会还要继续举行。
