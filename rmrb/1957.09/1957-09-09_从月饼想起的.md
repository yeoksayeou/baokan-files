    Thoughts Evoked by Mooncakes
    Shen Hugen
    The Mid-Autumn Festival is here, reminding me of eating mooncakes. Thinking of mooncakes, I also think of things related to eating mooncakes.
    I loved eating mooncakes since I was a child. I remember when I was six years old, although I was still quite ignorant, even mistaking my mother's eyebrows for "whiskers on her eyes," I already understood the taste of mooncakes. That year, on the morning of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I followed my mother to the market to buy groceries. I saw mooncakes of all sizes in the shop's glass cabinet, some weighing four taels, some a full catty, and some weighing five or six catties and sliced open. The sliced mooncakes were sprinkled with tempting red and green threads, and I was extremely eager to have one. Perhaps due to my mother's upbringing and influence, I didn't directly ask to buy a mooncake like other children. Instead, I used a somewhat worldly tone to hint at her: "Mom, what is this?" "This one is really big!" "Is three cents enough for this small one?" However, because she didn't have the money, she pretended not to understand and quickly pulled me away. That night, I was violently awakened by my mother, and I realized that my face and pillow were covered in tears. My mother asked me, "Agen, what are you crying about?" I thought for a moment and told her about dreaming of going to the market and seeing mooncakes, crying because I wanted one but she hit me, and I even made a naive gesture: "Look, this big." When my mother heard this, she also cried and hugged me tightly. The next day, I saw my mother rummaging in the chest for a while, taking something out, and when she came back after buying rice, she also bought two mooncakes. My sister and I didn't eat mooncakes until the second day of the Mid-Autumn Festival.
    One Mid-Autumn Festival, I was an apprentice. The boss was a person of some renown, so as the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, people from the surrounding villages sent mooncakes, piled high on the table, enough to fill a carrying pole. With so many mooncakes and so few people in the boss's family, I thought that we apprentices would finally get a taste, and I couldn't help but grin from ear to ear, as if I were already chewing on a mooncake. Unexpectedly, although each of us was given one, we gave it to our youngest apprentice brother. Because this day, while eating dinner, he accidentally broke a porcelain bowl and was scolded and beaten severely by the mistress, unable to even eat his meal, let alone get a mooncake, so he cried silently in bed all night. We couldn't bear it, so we gave him all our mooncakes. The next day, I heard that the boss's seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son were fighting over burying mooncakes in rat holes. This really infuriated me. In an instant, bitterness, sweetness, sourness, and spiciness filled my heart.
    A few days later, the mistress asked me to carry several loads of water. Because I was small, I fell into the pond along with the buckets. The mistress, probably to compensate for my grievance, actually gave me a mooncake, which felt like a dream come true, and I was overjoyed. Ah, this mooncake was so hard-earned! And so precious! I felt like Gorky in his childhood, when he rarely got something delicious to eat: "I tried my best to prolong the chewing time, to enjoy it for as long as possible, so that this wonderful time would not pass quickly. But this effort was futile, and the thing was quickly gone" (Gorky: "My Apprenticeship").
    After liberation, I turned over. In 1950, with the support of the trade union, I had a verbal lawsuit (argumentative struggle) with the boss, and my monthly salary increased from four dou of rice to nine dou and five sheng. That was the beginning of liberation, and the standard of living certainly couldn't be improved much, but on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival that year, I went to Hangzhou on official business. When I returned to the town, I bought two mooncakes for my mother.
    This was the first time in my life that I had bought mooncakes for my mother.
    Since then, seven years have passed. Every Mid-Autumn Festival, when the family gathers to eat mooncakes, we think of the past days. I think it's not just me who feels this way, but tens of thousands of people feel the same way. In the years since liberation, there have been so many such experiences. From any small thing, we can recall the hardships of the past and deeply feel the joy of today. It's not just about mooncakes.

### 从月饼想起的

    从月饼想起的
    沈虎根
    中秋节到了，使我想到了吃月饼，想到月饼，又想到了有关吃月饼的事儿。
    我从小就爱吃月饼。记得在六岁的时候，虽然还不大懂事，连母亲的眉毛也误认为是“眼睛上的胡须”，但对月饼的滋味已经很了解了。就在那年中秋节早上，我跟着母亲上街去买小菜，看到了店家玻璃柜里大大小小的月饼，有四两重的、有足斤重的、也有五六斤大而切开了的。切开的月饼上，撒着引人的红丝、绿丝，我真馋极了。大概由于母亲的教养和影响的关系吧，我没有像别的孩子一样直接了当地提出要买月饼，而是略知世故的，用一种试探性的口吻暗示她：“姆妈这是什么呀？”“这个真大呀！”“这个小的三分（钱）够不够？”然而，终因她没有钱，强作不晓得，匆匆地把我拉走了。当天夜里，我被母亲猛力地推醒过来，我发觉我脸上和枕头上全是泪水。母亲问我：“阿根，哭什么？”我想了想，就把梦里上街见到月饼，吵着要而被她打，因此哭了的事告诉她，还天真地做了个样子：“喏，有这样大”。母亲一听，也哭了，紧紧地抱着我。第二天，我见母亲在箱子里翻了一阵，拿了点什么出去，回来买了米的同时，也买了两个月饼来。我和姐姐才在中秋节的第二天，吃到了月饼。
    我当学徒的一个中秋节。老板是个小有名望的人，所以一临近中秋，就有四乡的人送月饼来，桌上叠得高高的，总有一担可挑。这么多的月饼，老板家的人又不多，心想我们学徒这回也有尝头了，不禁眉飞口甜，活像口中正嚼着月饼那样。谁料我们每人虽分到一个，但又让给了我们的小师弟。因为小师弟这天在吃晚饭时，一时不慎，砸破了一个瓷碗，被师母痛骂毒打，连饭也吃不上，月饼更没他的份了，故整夜在床上暗哭。我们不忍，就把月饼全让给他了。第二天，我听说：老板七岁的女儿和五岁的儿子在争着将月饼埋老鼠洞。这真把我气死了。一霎时，酸甜苦辣，充满了我的心。
    过了几天，师母叫我去挑了几担水，我个子小，连人连桶都跌下水塘。师母大概为了补偿我的委屈，居然给了我一个月饼，这对我来说，真像梦见天开，乐和极了。唉，这个月饼得来是多么的不易！又是多么的珍贵！我真像高尔基在童年时难得得到一点好吃的东西一样：“极力的把咀嚼的时间拖长，以多享受些时候，不使这个美好的时间很快的过去。可是这种努力是徒劳的，东西还是很快的没有了”（高尔基：“在人间”）。
    解放了，我翻了身。1950年我在工会的支持下，和老板打了一阵口头官司（说理斗争），每月工资就从四斗米增加到九斗五升。那是解放之初，生活水平当然还不能改善很多，但是就在这年中秋节前夕，我就因公到了杭州。回到镇上的时候，我就为母亲买了两个月饼。
    这是我有生以来第一次给母亲买月饼。
    从那时候起，又是七个年头过去了。每年中秋节，一家人团聚吃着月饼的时候，都会想起过去的日子。我想，不仅我一个人是这样，千千万万人都会是这样。解放这几年来，这样的体会真是太多了，从任何一件小事，都能想起过去的辛酸，都能深切地感到今天的欢乐，又岂止是月饼一件事呢。
