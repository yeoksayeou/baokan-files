American Dark Side

Art Serves Commerce

According to the American "Worker's Daily," not long ago, four hundred prominent American artists, educators, and representatives from other cultural fields jointly signed a petition to the government, requesting that the government pay attention to the people's artistic endeavors.

In the past, the US Congress also passed some bills establishing art advisory committees, but these bills were merely empty words. The Eisenhower administration fundamentally did not provide any financial support for the people's artistic endeavors.

The "Worker's Daily" pointed out: The United States claims to be the world's number one in wealth, but it lags behind in fortieth place among the world's nations in supporting artistic endeavors. The US Congress does not take even the most basic measures to promote the people's artistic endeavors, but the government spends billions of dollars on commercial art through tax exemptions. According to recent statistics, several large American companies spent two hundred million dollars on commercial television alone last year. Other large corporate organizations also used eight hundred million dollars to build extravagant entertainment venues solely for the enjoyment of capitalists.

    为商业服务的艺术
    据美国“工人日报”消息，不久以前四百位美国著名的艺术家、教育家和文化界其他方面的代表共同签名，向政府请愿，要求政府重视人民的艺术事业。
    过去美国国会也曾通过一些法案，成立艺术顾问委员会，但这些法案仅仅是纸上谈兵。艾森豪威尔政府对人民的艺术事业根本不给予经济上的支持。
    “工人日报”指出：美国自命财富世界第一，而在支持艺术事业方面却落后在世界各国的第四十位。美国国会不采取最起码的措施来促进人民的艺术事业，但政府却通过免税的措施为商业艺术耗费数十亿美元。据最近的统计，去年美国几家大公司仅仅为商业电视花了二亿美元。另几个大企业组织建造专供资本家享乐的花天酒地的娱乐场所也用了八亿美元。
