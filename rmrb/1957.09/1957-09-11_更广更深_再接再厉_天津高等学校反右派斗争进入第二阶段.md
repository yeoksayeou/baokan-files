　　Broader and Deeper, Continue the Efforts
　　The Anti-Rightist Struggle in Tianjin's Universities Enters the Second Stage
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th - On the basis of achieving significant victories in the first stage of the anti-Rightist struggle, more than 10,000 university students in Tianjin have now begun the second stage of the struggle, determined to continue their efforts and make the anti-Rightist struggle thorough and deep.
    The struggle in various schools is being carried out by utilizing the time before the start of the semester. Now, the struggle has fully unfolded. Each department and class in Tianjin University has established anti-Rightist struggle groups, shock brigades, or core combat groups. In just three or four days, the "Blooming and Contending Gardens," originally built with reed mats, and the walls of dormitories, dining halls, and classrooms were covered with big-character posters exposing and refuting the words and actions of Rightists. In order to carry out reasoned struggle with the Rightists, many students went separately to find facts. They used concrete materials investigated from newspapers and magazines, from factories, and from agricultural producers' cooperatives to refute the Rightists' fallacies, leaving many Rightists speechless. The current momentum of the struggle at Nankai University is even greater than in the first stage. Many middle-of-the-road elements who were originally watching from the sidelines have also dispelled their concerns, criticized their own mistakes, and bravely joined the fighting ranks. In the face of such a mighty mass struggle, some Rightists who were originally hidden have also had nowhere to hide. In order to make the anti-Rightist struggle thorough and deep, all schools have decided to postpone the start of the semester to the second half of September, and if necessary, formal classes may begin in early October.
    Tianjin's universities were once places where Rightists were extremely rampant. The struggle against the Rightists, which began in the schools from mid-June, has achieved significant victories. However, in general, the struggle is still not deep or thorough enough, and the development of the movement is also uneven. For example, the graduating classes of Nankai University and the third-year students of Tianjin University basically did not launch an anti-Rightist struggle before the summer vacation. Although some classes in other schools struggled against some Rightists, they did not completely expose the extremely reactionary Rightists in their grades and classes, especially the behind-the-scenes manipulators of certain small groups and the Rightists who were deeply hidden and hidden within the Party. Some major political viewpoints have also not been thoroughly clarified, and the broad masses of students have not received sufficient socialist education.
    In response to the above situation, the Party committees of various schools believe that this situation must be reversed immediately. Therefore, it was decided that before the start of the semester, each school would restart the second stage of the anti-Rightist struggle to "make up lessons" in order to continue the efforts and carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end.

### 更广更深　再接再厉　天津高等学校反右派斗争进入第二阶段

　　更广更深　再接再厉
　　天津高等学校反右派斗争进入第二阶段
    据新华社天津10日电　天津市一万多大学生在第一阶段反右派斗争取得重大胜利的基础上，目前又开始了第二阶段的斗争，决心再接再厉，把反右派斗争搞深搞透。
    各校这次斗争是利用开学前的一段时间进行的。现在，斗争已经全面展开。天津大学各系、班都成立了反右派斗争小组、突击队或核心战斗小组。只有三、四天的功夫，原来用席片搭起来的“鸣放园地”和宿舍、饭厅、教室的墙上，就贴满了揭露和驳斥右派分子言行的大字报。为了和右派分子开展说理斗争，很多学生分头去查找事实。他们用从报刊杂志上、从工厂里、从农业生产合作社里调查的具体材料来反驳右派分子的谬论，使许多右派分子被驳得哑口无言。南开大学现在的斗争声势比第一阶段更为浩大，很多原来观望的中间分子也解除顾虑、批判了自己的错误，勇敢地参加了战斗队伍。在这种声势浩大的群众斗争面前，原来隐蔽的一些右派分子也没有藏身之地了。为了把反右派斗争搞深搞透，各校都已经确定把开学日期延到9月下半月，必要时可到10月初正式上课。
    天津各高等学校曾是右派分子极为猖狂的地方。从6月中旬起各校展开的反击右派的斗争，虽取得了重大胜利。但是，总的说来，斗争还是不深不透，运动的发展也不平衡。如南开大学的毕业班、天津大学的三年级，在暑假前反右派斗争基本上没有展开。其他学校有些班级虽然对部分右派分子进行了斗争，但并未将本级本班的极端反动的右派分子完全揭露出来，特别是某些小集团的幕后操纵者以及隐蔽较深的和藏在党内的右派分子还未揪出来。有些重大的政治观点也还没有彻底辩明，广大学生群众还未受到充分的社会主义教育。
    针对上述情况，各校党委都认为，必须立即扭转这种局面。因此决定在开学前各校从新开始第二阶段的反右派斗争，进行“补课”，以便再接再厉，把反右派斗争进行到底。
