Boldly Mobilize the Masses, Don't Be Afraid of Debate
Hebei Rural Areas Launch Large-Scale Debate, Taking Airing Views as the Primary Step in Rectification
(Our newspaper's Baoding dispatch, September 15th, reporter Jin Feng): A large-scale mass debate about the two roads is unfolding in depth in the rural areas of Hebei Province. Leading cadres at all levels of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are personally going to grassroots organizations, promptly identifying and resolving problems, and powerfully promoting the movement forward.

In mid-August, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP transferred 173 department heads, deputy department heads, bureau directors, section chiefs, and general cadres from various provincial departments, led by Zhao Yimin, Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, to assist local Party organizations in conducting pilot socialist education work in various districts. Local and county Party committees have also dispatched many responsible cadres to go deep into townships and communes. The work of training Party members and Communist Youth League member backbones has been basically completed. The mass debate on the two roads is gradually unfolding in most rural areas.

In early September, Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, went to An'guo, Boye, Gaoyang, Lixian, and other places to understand the situation. In a telephone conference attended by the secretaries of the district committees on the evening of the 11th, he gave detailed instructions on the existing problems in the current movement.

Comrade Zhang Chengxian first assessed the current situation in the rural areas of Hebei Province. He said: After the previous stage of the socialist propaganda movement, mainly focused on the grain issue, the anti-socialist countercurrent in the countryside has been initially hit, the reactionary arrogance of landlords and rich peasants has been suppressed, and the capitalist ideology of some well-to-do middle peasants has been criticized. Righteousness in the countryside is rising, and the socialist enthusiasm of grassroots cadres has greatly increased, powerfully promoting the summer unified purchase work. However, from the perspective of the socialist revolution on the rural political and ideological front, the task is far from complete.

He pointed out: Party organizations must clearly recognize that the large-scale socialist education movement in rural areas is the beginning of rural rectification. The result of the debate between the two roads inside and outside the Party is a thorough ideological and organizational rectification of rural grassroots Party organizations, a profound class mobilization for poor and lower-middle peasants, and a powerful ideological transformation for upper-middle peasants. Currently, many Party organizations do not fully understand the nature and significance of this movement. Some simply see the economic significance of promoting unified purchase work, and therefore are impatient when the procurement task is not completed, and relaxed when the task is completed. Others simply see it as a way to strike at the reactionary arrogance of landlords and rich peasants. In order to lead the movement in depth, he required Party committees at all levels, down to the grassroots cadres, to clearly understand the fundamental significance of the movement and correct simplistic and one-sided views.

Regarding the steps of the movement, Comrade Zhang Chengxian emphasized that, whether inside or outside the Party in rural areas, it is necessary to fully air views and launch a debate on the two roads, taking the airing of views as the primary step in rural rectification. He said that some places focus on conducting education from top to bottom, but this method often fails to fully expose thoughts and distinguish right from wrong. The pilot experiences of many regions have proved that only through fully airing views and debate (that is, conducting political and ideological education from bottom to top in a guided manner using the mass line method), opening up various thoughts, can ideological problems be thoroughly resolved. Currently, some county leading cadres still have concerns about airing views. Some fear that the evil trends that have just been suppressed will rise again after airing views, making it difficult for cadres to work. Others fear that airing views will not take off. These need to be well persuaded, to make them realize that after airing views and large-scale debates, the work will not be more difficult, but better. As long as the masses are earnestly mobilized and democracy is promoted, airing views will be possible.

Regarding the issue of training the ranks, Comrade Zhang Chengxian mentioned that many places have universally trained Party members, which is good. But ideological rectification within the Party is not thorough, and therefore they seem powerless when leading the mass debate. He pointed out that the debate must also revolve around the two roads within the Party. For anti-socialist elements within the Party who have indeed degenerated and violated laws and regulations, they should be treated the same as those outside the Party and dealt with seriously. When training Party member backbones, all localities should go deeper through debate, and continue to rectify the ranks of Party members in the mass debate.

Uniting the majority of the middle peasants is an important key to thoroughly isolating rural anti-socialist elements and ensuring the victory of the movement. Comrade Zhang Chengxian mentioned that some places do not pay enough attention to this work, so that many middle peasants are still watching and have not been united into an important force for struggle. He pointed out that local and county Party committees should pay attention to this work, educate grassroots Party organizations, patiently help the middle peasants, criticize the capitalist ideas among them, and listen to their correct opinions and answer their reasonable demands.

Jiangxi Sums Up the Pilot Work of Large-Scale Debate, Emphasizing Persuading People with Reason and Relying on the Poor Peasants
(Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch, September 15th): The pilot work of the large-scale debate on the grain issue in the rural areas of Jiangxi Province has ended and is being carried out comprehensively.

In the pilot work, the general practice is divided into three steps: first, find out the problems and ideological situation, and carry out airing of views; second, conduct debates based on the problems raised, and distinguish right from wrong; third, summarize the experience. The specific methods are: first, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, mobilize at all levels, criticize the departmentalism and tailism of cadres, and make them clear about the direction and firm in their confidence; then, through cadres going deep into the masses, cultivate backbones and activists. Among the peasant masses (including individual households), generally taking agricultural production teams or production groups as units, using examples from before and after liberation for comparison, focusing on criticizing the capitalist ideas of some well-to-do middle peasants and the individualistic ideas of some peasants.

Significant results have been achieved in the places that have undergone debates. The right-leaning emotions, tailism and departmentalism of the cadres have been basically overcome. The progress of pre-purchase work has turned from slow to fast. The average daily grain entering the warehouse in the province in late August increased more than five times compared to the first half of August. An even greater gain is that the class consciousness of the masses has been raised, the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries have been exposed, and grain speculation has been further hit.

The main points of the experience summarized by various places are as follows: First, it is necessary to air views well and let go well, and to fully express opinions from all sides. In the debate, it is necessary to present the facts and persuade people with reason based on the various materials related to the grain issue collected in advance. Second, implement the class line, resolutely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and unite the middle peasants. Treat the people being criticized from the standpoint of unity, and encourage them to support the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain with practical actions after the criticism, and educate other members not to discriminate against them. The sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries should be resolutely combated. Third, strengthen organizational leadership. In addition to the Party branch strengthening its core leadership role, each cooperative should train a certain number of cadres with mass work experience, upright style, and high prestige to help the branch carry out its work.

Siyang County Cadres Summarize the Previous Stage of Large-Scale Debate, Criticizing the Brutal Methods of Not Trusting the Masses
(Dispatch from Xinhua Daily): In carrying out the socialist propaganda and education movement in rural areas, it is necessary to oppose right-leaning ideas and "leftist" practices, and resolutely believe in the majority of the masses. This is the conclusion reached after the Communist Party branch secretaries in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, discussed the experiences of the previous period.

Before this meeting, all districts, townships, and cooperatives had conducted pilot large-scale debates. The more than 600 people who attended the meeting had gained a lot of experience in this work. In reviewing the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of work, debates were launched.

Some people believe that peasants should not be allowed to air views, let alone engage in large-scale debates, otherwise, if erroneous opinions cannot be refuted, it will be even more troublesome. A branch secretary in Xinyuan District said: The reason why capitalist ideas can raise their heads in rural areas, and the reason why peasant individualism can grow, is because the leadership has emphasized persuasive education. Some people also said: Because it was proposed that everyone should have food to eat, guaranteeing that no one would starve to death, some peasants boldly waste and casually shout that there is not enough food to eat. If the slogan "starving to death is deserved" were put forward, there would be no problems. Therefore, many people proposed that problems cannot be solved by debate alone, and those who are guilty should be dealt with, and those who make mistakes should be hit. Branch secretaries of Geji, Linhe, Xinyuan, and other townships even complained that the Party's policies were too lenient and hoped that the leadership could let them go to subdue them.

The above ideas were discussed at the meeting, and it was believed that this "leftist" practice was essentially a reflection of right-leaning thinking. It was believed that as long as the majority of the masses are resolutely trusted, the victory of the large-scale debate can be guaranteed. County Party Secretary Huang Keming said in his report: According to the county Party committee's investigation, 70% of the rural population, the poor and lower-middle peasants, are determined to take the socialist road and support the unified purchase and sale of grain. Most upper-middle peasants are also willing to take the socialist road. He cited examples to show that during the grain issue debate, the vast majority of people resolutely supported the policy of unified purchase and sale. During the discussion, some branch secretaries used many examples to show that peasants are able to distinguish right from wrong. Many comrades also used many facts to show that the fundamental reason for not trusting the masses is the lack of class analysis in thinking and the existence of bureaucracy in work style.

The meeting further analyzed whether it is good to use simple methods of subjugation by force in the debate. Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Chengxiang Township used this method. This cooperative did not persuade people with reason through debate, but adopted crude methods of subjugation by force. As a result, it seriously disrupted its own ranks, affected the relationship between the Party and the masses, caused peasants to doubt the Party's policies, and failed to achieve the purpose of raising cadres and educating the masses. The lessons of Heping Cooperative gave everyone a profound education. Those who made similar mistakes made self-criticisms. The cadres of Heping Cooperative also expressed at the meeting that they would correct their mistakes and re-lead the members to launch a large-scale debate by presenting facts and reasoning.

Since trusting the majority of the masses can guarantee the victory of the socialist large-scale debate, can we not do arduous work and the grain problem can be solved? After discussion, the meeting answered in the negative. The county Party committee specifically analyzed the situation in the rural areas of Siyang County in its report. It believed that the situation is basically good, but the capitalist and individualistic ideas of the peasants, and the tailism and departmentalism of the cadres are quite serious. Especially in the past few months, landlords, rich peasants, and speculative merchants have been very arrogant, and many upper-middle peasants have sold less surplus grain and purchased grain through improper channels to profit from it, which has fueled the development of capitalist ideas. These have already or will affect the smooth progress of this year's unified purchase and sale of grain. Arduous ideological work must also be done to complete the grain procurement task.

According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the CCP and the Provincial Party Committee, the meeting decided to use the large-scale debate to enable all peasants to systematically and comprehensively understand the important significance of correctly handling the relationship between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and individuals, and of building the country industriously and thriftily, running cooperatives industriously and thriftily, and managing households industriously and thriftily.

At the end of the meeting, everyone said with confidence: We will definitely be able to persuade people with reason, do a good job in the socialist large-scale debate, complete the grain procurement task, and consolidate the socialist front. (Chibu)

　　放手发动群众  不要害怕争论
　　河北大部农村展开大辩论把鸣放作为整风首要步骤
    本报保定15日电　记者金凤报道：一场大规模的群众性的关于两条道路的大辩论正在河北省农村深入开展。中共河北省各级领导干部亲赴各基层组织，及时发现问题，解决问题，有力地推动运动前进。
    中共河北省委在8月中旬即抽调省直各机关正副部长、厅局长、处长和一般干部一百七十三人，由省委组织部长赵一民等率领，分赴各专区协助各地党组织进行社会主义教育试点工作。各地、县委也都抽出许多负责干部深入乡社。目前全省各县已普遍召开了三级干部会议。训练党员及共青团员骨干的工作已经基本完成。群众性的关于两条道路的大辩论正在大部分农村逐步展开。
    中共河北省委书记张承先于9月上旬到安国、博野、高阳、蠡县等地了解情况，并在11日晚召开的地委书记参加的电话会议上，对当前运动中存在的问题作了详尽的指示。
    张承先同志首先估计了河北省农村目前的形势。他说：经过前一阶段以粮食问题为主要内容的社会主义宣传运动，农村中反社会主义逆流已受到初步打击，地主、富农的反动气焰已经打下去，部分富裕中农的资本主义思想已受到批判，农村正气上升，基层干部的社会主义热情大为高涨，夏季统购工作得到有力的推动。但是，作为农村政治思想战线上的社会主义革命来看，还远远未完成任务。
    他指出：党组织必须明确认识农村大规模的社会主义教育运动，就是农村整风的开始。党内外展开两条道路的大辩论的结果，对于农村基层党组织是一次思想上组织上的彻底整顿，对于贫农、下中农是一次深刻的阶级发动，对于上中农则是有力的思想改造。目前有不少党组织对这一运动的性质和意义认识不足。有的单纯看到了推动统购工作的经济意义，因而在没有完成征购任务时表现急躁，完成了任务则又表现松懈。也有的简单地看作是打击地主、富农的反动气焰。为了把运动引向深入，他要求各级党委直至基层干部，明确认识运动的根本意义，纠正简单化和片面的看法。
    关于运动的步骤问题，张承先同志强调说，在农村无论党内党外，都要大鸣大放，展开两条道路的大辩论，把鸣放作为农村整风的首要步骤。他说，有些地方着重自上而下地正面进行教育，这种办法往往不能充分暴露思想，分清是非。许多地区的试点经验证明，只有经过充分的鸣放和争辩（这也就是自下而上地有领导地用群众路线的方法进行政治思想教育），敞开了各种思想，才能透彻解决思想问题。现在有些县的领导干部对鸣放还存在顾虑，有的怕鸣放以后刚下去的邪气又会上升，干部不好工作，有的怕鸣放不起来。这些都需要很好地进行说服，要使他们认识到经过鸣放和大辩论，工作不会是更难做而会更好做了。只要认真放手发动群众，发扬民主，就能鸣放起来。
    关于训练队伍问题，张承先同志谈到，许多地方已普遍训练了党员，这是好的。但党内思想整的不透，因而在领导群众辩论时显得无力。他指出：党内也必须围绕两条道路进行辩论；对于党内确实已蜕化变质、违法乱纪的反社会主义分子，应当与党外的一视同仁，严肃处理。各地在训练党员骨干时，要通过辩论搞得深一些，并且要在群众大辩论中继续整顿党员队伍。
    团结中农的大多数，是彻底孤立农村反社会主义分子，保证运动胜利的重要关键。张承先同志谈到，有些地方对这一工作不够重视，以致不少中农还在观望，没有团结成为斗争的重要力量。他指出：各地、县委都要注意这个工作，教育基层党组织，一方面要耐心帮助中农，批判他们中间的资本主义思想，另方面要虚心听取他们的正确意见，答复他们的合理要求。
　　江西总结大辩论试点工作强调以理服人和依靠贫农
    本报南昌15日电　江西省农村关于粮食问题的大辩论试点工作已经结束，正在全面开展。
    各地在试点工作中，一般的做法分三步：第一步摸清问题和思想情况，开展鸣放；第二步根据提出的问题，进行争论，明辨是非；第三步总结经验。具体做法是：首先从党内到党外、从干部到群众，层层发动，批判干部中的本位主义和尾巴主义思想，使他们明确方向，坚定信心；然后通过干部深入群众，培养骨干和积极分子。在农民群众中（包括单干户在内）一般以农业生产小队或生产小组为单位，用解放前后事例作对比，着重批判部分富裕中农的资本主义思想和部分农民的个人主义思想。
    在经过辩论的地方收到了显著效果。基本上克服了干部的右倾情绪和尾巴主义、本位主义思想。预购工作的进度由慢转快。全省8月下旬每天入库粮食平均较8月上半月增加了五倍以上。更重大的收获是群众的阶级觉悟提高了，地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动被揭穿了，进一步打击了粮食投机。
    各地总结大辩论的经验主要有如下几点：第一，首先要鸣得好、放得好，把各方面的意见完全说出来。在辩论中要根据事先收集好有关粮食问题的各种材料，摆出事实，以理服人。第二、贯彻阶级路线，坚决依靠贫农和下中农，团结中农。对批判的人从团结出发，批判以后并鼓励他们用实际行动拥护粮食统购统销政策，并教育其他社员不要歧视他们。对地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动，应坚决进行斗争。第三、加强组织领导。除党支部加强核心领导作用外，每个社应训练一定数量的有群众工作经验、作风正派、威信高的干部，帮助支部进行工作。
　　泗阳县干部总结前段大辩论批判不信任群众的蛮干作法
    本报讯　据新华日报报道：在农村中开展社会主义宣传教育运动，必须反对右倾思想和“左”的做法，坚决地相信群众的大多数。这是江苏省泗阳县中共支部书记会议上讨论了前一时期的经验以后得出的结论。
    这次会前，各区、乡、社都已进行了大辩论的试点，到会的六百多人对这一工作都有了不少体会。在回顾前一段工作的经验教训的时候，展开了争论。
    有些人认为不能让农民大鸣大放大争，否则，错误的意见驳不倒会更麻烦。新袁区一个支部书记说：农村中资本主义思想所以能够抬头，农民的个人主义所以能够滋长，就是因为领导上强调了说服教育。还有人说：因为提出人人有饭吃，保证不饿死一个人，所以有些农民才大胆浪费，随便叫喊粮食不够吃。要是提出“饿死活该”的口号，什么问题都没有了。因此，不少人提出，光靠辩论不能解决问题，应该有罪就办，有错误就打击。葛集、临河、新袁等乡的分支书记甚至埋怨党的政策太宽大，希望领导上能放手让他们去压服。
   会上对上述思想进行了讨论，认为这种“左”的做法，实质上是思想右倾的反映。认为只要坚决地信任群众的多数，就能够保证大辩论取得胜利。县委书记黄克明在报告内说：根据县委调查，占农村人口70％的贫农和下中农坚决走社会主义道路，拥护粮食统购统销。多数上中农也愿意走社会主义道路。他举例说明，在进行粮食问题辩论的时候，绝大多数人坚决拥护统购统销政策。在讨论时，有些支部书记又用许多实例说明农民是能够明辨是非的。许多同志还用许多事实，说明不信任群众的根本原因，是思想上缺乏阶级分析，作风上存在着官僚主义。
   会议进一步分析了在辩论中用简单的以力服人的做法好不好。城厢乡和平农业社就是运用这种做法的。这个社不是通过辩论以理服人，而是采取粗暴的方法以力服人。结果，严重地搞乱了自己的队伍，影响了党和群众的关系，使农民对党的政策发生了怀疑，并没能达到提高干部和教育群众的目的。和平社的教训，使大家受到了深刻的教育。有类似错误的人进行了自我批评。和平社的干部在会上也表示要改正错误，要以摆事实、说道理的方法，重新领导社员展开大辩论。
    既然信任群众的大多数，就能保证社会主义大辩论的胜利，是不是可以不做艰巨的工作，粮食问题就可以解决了呢？会议经过讨论，回答是否定的。县委在报告中具体分析了泗阳县农村的形势。认为基本上是好的，但是，农民的资本主义和个人主义思想，干部的尾巴主义和本位主义思想都是相当严重的。特别是最近几个月来，地主、富农、投机奸商很嚣张，很多上中农少卖余粮和套购粮食，从中取利，助长了资本主义思想的发展。这些都已经或将要影响今年粮食统购统销工作的顺利进行。还必须做艰巨的思想工作，才能完成粮食征购任务。
    会议根据中共中央和省委的指示，决定通过大辩论使全体农民系统地、全面地弄懂正确处理国家、农业社和个人的关系和勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的重要意义。
   会议结束的时候，大家都充满信心地说：我们一定能够以理服人，搞好社会主义大辩论，完成粮食征购任务，巩固社会主义阵地。　（赤布）
