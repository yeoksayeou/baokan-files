    Fujian Province's local political and legal departments have recently, over the past two months, exposed a group of bourgeois rightists who oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and maliciously attack political and legal work.

    These rightists are He Gonggan, Director of the Provincial Department of Justice; Lin Dengwen and Wu Daxin, assistant judges of the Provincial Higher People's Court; and Ren Dunqing, Ren Jiade, Yao Huanxing and others, staff members of the People's Procuratorates of Fujian Province, Xiamen City, and Nanping City. They took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement to carry out various anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities, clamoring that "the Party Committee does not understand the law and cannot lead political and legal work," and arrogantly demanding that "Communist Party members withdraw from the political and legal departments." They also tried every possible means to attack the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the anti-rightist movement, and to "seek redress" for the counter-revolutionaries who were suppressed.

    In addition to spreading fallacies everywhere, attacking and smearing the achievements of socialist construction and transformation in all aspects, He Gonggan also repeatedly slandered "not a single Communist Party member from top to bottom understands the law" and "the current political and legal work is a mess." He slandered the education and transformation of old judicial personnel as "knocking them down with one blow," attempting to negate and seize the Communist Party's leadership over political and legal work. He Gonggan also spread the reactionary political proposition of so-called "democracy for all," which opposes the people's democratic dictatorship, attempting to extend democracy to counter-revolutionaries and forced labor convicts. He repeatedly advocated that the punishment of counter-revolutionary criminals should be "lighter, lighter, and lighter again," while advocating that "those who have general errors due to ideological backwardness should be brought to justice and severely punished." He Gonggan, as the director of the Department of Justice, even described Wang Qinmei, a counter-revolutionary who had killed revolutionary comrades, as "only having backward words and deeds and should be released without guilt"; he also requested lenient treatment for one of his counter-revolutionary friends who had been sentenced to labor reform, and threatened the handling cadres, saying: "He is my old friend, you must handle it well."

    福建各地政法部门揭露一批右派分子
    本报讯　福建省各地政法部门最近两个多月来揭露出了一批反对共产党领导并恶意攻击政法工作的资产阶级右派分子。
    这些右派分子是省司法厅长何公敢、省高级人民法院助理审判员林登文、吴大新和福建省、厦门市、南平市等人民检察院的工作人员任敦卿、任家德、姚焕兴等人。他们利用共产党整风的机会进行各种反共反社会主义的活动，他们叫嚣说“党委不懂法律、不能领导政法工作”，狂妄地要“共产党员退出政法部门”。他们还千方百计地到处攻击肃反、镇反运动的成就，为被镇压的反革命分子“伸冤”。
    何公敢除了到处散布谬论，从各方面攻击和污蔑社会主义建设和改造的成就外，还一再污蔑“共产党从上到下没有一个懂得法律”，“现在的政法工作是一团糟”。谩骂对旧司法人员的教育、改造工作是“一棍子打死”，妄图以此否定和夺取共产党对政法工作的领导权。何公敢还散布所谓“全民民主”的反对人民民主专政的反动政治主张，企图把民主扩大到反革命、劳改犯身上。他一再主张惩治反革命罪犯要“轻些、轻些、再轻些”，而对因思想落后而发生的一般错误行为则主张“要绳之以法，严加惩处”。身为司法厅长的何公敢竟把一个曾杀死过革命同志的反革命分子王钦妹，说成是“只有落后言行，应无罪释放”；对他的一个被判处劳动改造的反革命朋友，也要求从轻处理，并威胁经办的干部说：“他是我的老朋友，你们要好好办理。”
