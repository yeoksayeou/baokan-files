To pass the socialist test politically and ideologically

Huang Dingchen, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party

In 1956, based on the new situation of the basic completion of the socialist revolution, the Chinese Communist Party proposed the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with democratic parties. The vast majority of members of the democratic parties warmly supported this policy. However, we must recognize that the existence of any political party is to serve a certain economic base. With the basic completion of the socialist revolution, the economic base of Chinese society is a single socialist economy. If the democratic parties are to coexist with the Communist Party, the leader of socialist construction, for a long time, the condition can only be to adapt to the needs of this era and sincerely serve socialism. At the same time, we must also recognize that the class base of our democratic parties is the national bourgeoisie and its intellectuals. Therefore, in order to make our democratic parties political groups that truly serve socialism, we must vigorously carry out fundamental self-reform, so that we can, together with the people of the whole country, pass the socialist test ideologically and politically. However, after the Chinese Communist Party launched the rectification movement in May of this year, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and socialism, attempting to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party and drag our country onto the road of capitalism. Many of these rightists are leaders and members of democratic parties. At the same time, a large number of members of democratic parties, due to the lack of good transformation of their positions and viewpoints and a vague understanding, stood by indifferently in the face of the serious struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and some even had varying degrees of sympathy and support for the rightists. This serious situation not only shows that our democratic parties must undergo fundamental transformation, but also puts forward the task that we must first solve, that is, to resolutely participate in the anti-rightist struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, thoroughly expose and criticize the words and deeds of the rightists hidden within our democratic parties and the right-leaning thoughts existing in the democratic parties, so that we can become political groups that serve socialism in name and in fact.

Since the class base of our democratic parties is the national bourgeoisie and its intellectuals, this determines that there must be many rightists within our democratic parties. Therefore, the fact that some local organizations of democratic parties have not yet exposed rightists does not mean that there are no rightists, but only that the rightists have not yet been exposed. This is exactly the case with our Zhi Gong Party. In the Beijing, Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi regions where we have organizational structures, there are rightists, but the time of exposure is different. We had such experience in the previous stage of the struggle. Before the anti-rightist struggle in the Beijing area was deepened, many people had paralyzing thoughts, thinking that there were probably no rightists in the organization of the Zhi Gong Party in the Beijing area, but after our anti-rightist struggle was fully launched and deepened under the leadership of the Party, it proved that the fact was not the case.

However, the situation of some local organizations of our Zhi Gong Party in this regard is still not satisfactory. There are still varying degrees of right-leaning views and gentle breezes and drizzles in the leadership and members. The rightists have not been thoroughly exposed and criticized. This situation must be resolutely reversed in the future. We must strive for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the cooperation and assistance of relevant units, strengthen the strength of the rectification leading group, overcome right-leaning views and gentle breezes and drizzles, rely on the masses to continue to deepen the struggle, so that the crimes of the rightists are thoroughly exposed and criticized, completely discredited, and isolated, thereby forcing them to bow their heads, confess their crimes, and accept transformation. In order to thoroughly deepen and comprehensively launch this great struggle, the Zhi Gong Party has decided to hold an enlarged meeting of the entire Central Committee in mid-September to specifically discuss the rectification work to clarify the guiding principles and tasks, unify understanding and steps.

In general, we must recognize our current serious tasks and the great significance of this anti-rightist struggle, and enable all members to receive profound education in this struggle between the two roads, pass the socialist test politically and ideologically, and gradually transform into a political force that truly serves socialism.

    从政治上、思想上过社会主义关
    中国致公党中央常务委员　黄鼎臣
    1956年中国共产党根据社会主义革命基本完成的新形势提出同民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针，各民主党派绝大部分成员对这一方针是热烈拥护的。可是，我们必须认识，任何一个政党的存在，都是为了服务于一定的经济基础。随着社会主义革命的基本完成，中国社会的经济基础就是单一的社会主义经济。民主党派要和社会主义建设的领导者共产党长期共存，其条件只能是适应这个时代的需要，真诚地为社会主义服务。同时，我们还必须认识，我们民主党派的阶级基础是民族资产阶级及其知识分子。因此要使我们民主党派能够成为真正为社会主义服务的政治团体，还必须大力进行根本的自我改造，使我们和全国人民一起从思想上政治上过社会主义关。但是在今年5月，中国共产党展开整风运动后，资产阶级右派分子就向共产党向社会主义疯狂进攻，企图取消共产党的领导和把我国拖向资本主义的道路。这些右派分子，很多是民主党派的领导人和成员。同时也有很大一部分的民主党派成员，由于立场观点没有很好的转变，认识模糊，在社会主义和资本主义两条道路的严重斗争面前竟袖手旁观，甚至有些对右派分子还有不同程度的同情和支持。这种严重的情况，不仅说明了我们民主党派必须进行根本的改造，而且提出了我们必须首先解决的任务，这就是要在中国共产党领导下坚决投入反右派的斗争，彻底地揭发和批判隐藏在我们民主党派内部的右派分子的言行和民主党派中存在着的右倾思想，使我们能够成为名副其实的为社会主义服务的政治团体。
    我们民主党派的阶级基础既然是民族资产阶级及其知识分子，这就决定了我们民主党派内一定会有不少右派分子。因此，民主党派有些地方组织还未揭发出右派分子，并不能说没有右派分子存在，只不过是右派分子还未暴露。就我们致公党来说，也正是这样。在我们有组织机构的北京、广东、福建和广西地区，都存在着右派分子，只不过揭露的时间先后不同而已。在我们上一阶段的斗争中就有这样的经验。在北京地区反右派斗争尚未深入以前，有不少人存在着麻痹思想，以为致公党在北京地区的组织中大概没有右派分子，但等我们的反右派斗争在党的领导下，全面展开深入下去以后，就证明了事实并不是这样。
    可是，我们致公党有些地方组织的情况在这方面还是不尽令人满意的。在领导上和成员中仍存在着不同程度的右倾观点、温情主义，右派分子还没有被彻底的揭发和批判，这种情况今后必须坚决予以扭转。我们必须争取中国共产党的领导和有关单位的配合与协助，并加强整风领导小组的力量，更须克服右倾观点和温情主义，依靠群众将斗争继续深入下去，使右派分子的罪行受到彻底暴露和批判，体无完肤，威信扫地，陷于孤立，从而迫使他们低头认罪接受改造。为着彻底深入、全面展开这一伟大的斗争，致公党已决定在9月中旬召开全体中央委员会议的扩大会议，专门讨论整风工作以明确方针任务，统一认识和步骤。
    总的来说，我们必须认识目前我们的严重任务和这次反右派斗争的伟大意义，并使全体成员在这次两条道路的斗争中受到深刻的教育，从政治上思想上过好社会主义这一关，逐步改造成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。
