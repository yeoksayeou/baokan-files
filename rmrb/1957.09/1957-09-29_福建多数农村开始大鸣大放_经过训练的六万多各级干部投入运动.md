Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th: Approximately 60% of the townships in Fujian Province have begun to launch a high tide of the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign, with some townships already entering the stage of great debate. The remaining townships are intensifying preparations and will successively begin the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign.

In this "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign, over 60,000 cadres at all levels throughout the province have been投入into the movement. They have all undergone training beforehand, clarifying the nature, purpose, and requirements of the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" and great debate campaign, thus ensuring the healthy development of the movement.

In the townships where a "blooming and contending" upsurge has already formed, participation in the "blooming and contending" is extremely widespread, and the content of the "blooming and contending" involves all aspects such as the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the issue of collectivization, the relationship between workers and peasants, the relationship between urban and rural areas, social order, adherence to the legal system, and the leadership of the Party. In Liming Agricultural Cooperative of Lianhua Township, Haicheng County, which created a national record for large-area high-yield rice production, more than 90% of the adult cooperative members participated in the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign, putting forward many useful opinions and suggestions.

In the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign in various places, close attention is paid to combining it with production and other work. From the county to the district to the township, special personnel are assigned to be responsible for guiding production. In more than ninety townships in Minhou County, rural Party members and township and cooperative cadres are divided into two groups: one group goes deep into the fields to lead production, and the other group leads the masses to "bloom and contend" together, and earnestly listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses.

The cooperative members in these townships have not only put forward a large number of opinions on improving the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives, but have also launched production competitions such as accumulating manure.

    福建多数农村开始大鸣大放
    经过训练的六万多各级干部投入运动
    据新华社福州28日电　福建省已有60％左右的乡开始掀起大鸣大放高潮，部分乡已进入大辩论阶段。其余的乡正在加紧准备，即将陆续展开大鸣大放。
    在这次大鸣大放中，全省投入运动的各级干部达六万多人。他们事先都经过训练，明确了大鸣大放大争的性质、目的和要求，因而能够保证运动的健康发展。
    在已经形成鸣放热潮的乡，参加鸣放的人极为广泛，鸣放的内容涉及到粮食统购统销政策、合作化问题、工农关系、城乡关系、社会治安、遵守法制以及党的领导等各个方面。创造全国水稻大面积丰产纪录的海澄县莲花乡黎明农业社，90％以上的成年社员都参加了大鸣大放，提出很多有益的意见和建议。
    各地在大鸣大放中，都注意密切结合生产和其他工作，从县到区、到乡都指定专人负责指导生产。闽侯县的九十多个乡都把农村党员和乡、社干部分成两部分，一部分深入田间领导生产，一部分带领群众一起鸣放，并认真听取群众的意见和批评。
    这些乡的社员不但提出了大量改进农业社经营管理的意见，还展开了积肥等生产竞赛。
