    A Great Class Education
    Mao Yixin, Deputy Director of the Technical Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
    I feel that this rectification movement and the struggle against the rightists are another great class education for me. After seven or eight years since liberation, I was under the impression that I had at least resolved the issue of class stand, that I could distinguish between friend and foe, and between right and wrong. But in this movement, I still lacked the ability to discern things on many key issues. Even on the fundamental issue of taking the socialist road, I almost got fooled by the rightists' trick of switching the sky and the earth without realizing it immediately. How dangerous this is!
    Taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification, the rightists carried out malicious propaganda to distort right and wrong on many issues in an attempt to achieve their anti-Party and anti-socialist goals. They tried their best to exaggerate and uglify the mistakes of individual Party members, portraying them as the image of all Party members. Under the guise of so-called sharp criticism, they were actually engaged in malicious abuse, viciously exaggerating the necessary differential treatment in work as a "hierarchy." They pretended to speak for the peasants on the surface, but in reality, they were reversing black and white and making groundless attacks. At the same time, they interspersed their speeches with many Marxist-Leninist terms or Chairman Mao's statements to hide the essence of their rightist remarks, using tricks of passing off fish eyes for pearls or switching the sky and the earth to deceive the masses. This requires a firm proletarian stand and keen political acumen to discern, but I lacked these things, so I was once blinded by them.
    When the People's Daily began to issue calls to counter the rightists, I initially thought it was unnecessary. But a series of conspiracies and tricks by the rightists awakened me, and I realized the harm of the rightists and the necessity of countering them. However, there was still one issue I hadn't clarified, which was sentimentalism. When I read the People's Daily's report on overcoming sentimentalism and launching reasoned struggles, I thought it was right, and I expressed my agreement. But when it came to countering Du Zhenyuan, a rightist who had been familiar with me for more than 30 years, sentimentalism had obstructed me. Originally, I was aware of Du Zhenyuan's ugly face and understood some of his background. But he and I were old friends for more than 30 years, and it was inconvenient for me to expose him. I thought it would be best if I provided the information and let others expose him. But this sentimental idea could not withstand the serious test. After inner struggle, I quickly realized this erroneous thinking must be resolutely overcome, and I decided to personally expose Du Zhenyuan's ugly words and deeds. After I personally participated in the struggle against the rightists, I felt happy both physically and mentally, as if I had contributed to a huge project.
    I feel that the Party's adoption of the method of thorough reasoning in this struggle against the rightists is extremely wise. Some people said that when the rightists began their attacks, why didn't the Party immediately fight back, was it too indulgent, and some people thought it was "luring the enemy deep." I think the Party's doing so was necessary in order to implement the "blooming and contending" policy. On the one hand, those well-intentioned critics can speak freely to facilitate the improvement of work; on the other hand, let those poisonous weeds grow so that they can be eradicated. What's wrong with "indulgence"? As for "luring the enemy deep," it is even more groundless. The Party invited non-Party members to help with the rectification, and did not regard them as enemies. If someone sees himself as an enemy and feels he has been "lured" into a trap, then it just exposes his true colors. Those rightists isolated themselves from the people, launched frenzied attacks in a hostile capacity, they rushed up, how can it be said to be "lured"? If they are enemies, they should be rounded up and eliminated, what is there to lure or not?
    After the counterattack against the rightists began, in large and small forums and debates (the Ministry of Railways has held more than 40 large forums, and various units have held even more small forums), speakers were able to present facts, reason, and refute the rightist remarks based on reason, which is the most powerful method. This enables those who hear it to thoroughly understand the harmfulness and maliciousness of the rightist remarks, and prevent them from being confused by them. In addition, the use of big-character posters and wall newspapers as debate methods is also extremely effective.
    In this process, some rightist remarks were excerpted and published in newspapers in columns such as "What Words," "What Pictures," and "Put It Out for Everyone to See." This also helps everyone improve their ability to distinguish. After reading some of these remarks for the first time, I could not recognize their harmfulness, and only after repeated thinking did I understand their implied meaning. This is also a good way to improve our understanding and awareness, so that we can participate more forcefully in the struggle against the rightists.
    This kind of debate with the rightists with full reasoning is an important part of this struggle against the rightists. It is also a very powerful link. The rightists have falsely accused the Communist Party of implementing a "policy of fooling the people" and a "policy of high pressure" towards the masses. They said that the Communist Party adopted the policy of "the people can be made to follow it, but cannot be made to know it." After this struggle of reasoning, all those rightist nonsense will completely collapse without being attacked.
    I feel that rectifying while correcting is another feature of this movement. It can be said that it truly achieves doing what is said and seeing results on the spot. This has encouraged the enthusiasm of all those who make suggestions, and has also given the rightists the most powerful factual counterattack. The rectification is to eliminate sectarianism, subjectivism and bureaucracy. Rectifying while correcting eliminates them during the rectification process, eliminating as much as is discovered, and eliminating as much as possible. Even if it cannot be resolved immediately, as long as it should be resolved, research and measures are taken immediately. The issue of electron tube prices that I raised has been directly answered by the electron tube factory. The fact that the Communist Party truly does what it says is the guarantee that sectarianism, subjectivism and bureaucracy will eventually be eliminated. This is also the guarantee that our country's socialist construction will be successful.
    Because the struggle against the rightists adopted the method of full reasoning, and the rectification and blooming adopted the active method of rectifying while correcting, this has greatly improved the understanding and awareness of the broad masses. This has made the socialist stand of all those who participated in the struggle more firm, and made them deeply realize that the struggle against the rightists is a necessary struggle. After the victory in the struggle against the rightists, continuing the rectification will inevitably be more effective. In the future, work in all aspects will inevitably be greatly improved. My personal experience is that after my understanding is improved, I can actively devote myself to the struggle against the rightists, dare to speak more, and dare to fight against all incorrect words and deeds.

    一次伟大的阶级教育
    铁道部技术局副局长  茅以新
    我感到这一次整风运动与反右派斗争的运动对于我是又一次伟大的阶级教育。在解放以后过了七、八年的今天，我满以为至少在阶级立场的问题上，是已经解决了，能分清敌我，分清是非了。可是在这次运动中，我在许多关键性的问题上竟还缺少辨别事物的能力、甚至在走社会主义的道路这一基本性问题上，右派分子来一个偷天换日的手法，我都几乎被其蒙混过去未能立时发现。这是多么危险的事啊。
    右派分子趁共产党整风的机会，对许多问题进行颠倒是非的恶意宣传，以期达到他们反党反社会主义的企图。他们把个别党员的错误竭力渲染扩大，竭力丑化，说成是所有党员的形象。他们在美其名为尖锐的批评的借口下，实际上是进行恶意的谩骂，把工作上必要的差别待遇制度恶毒地渲染成为“等级制度”。他们表面上装作是替农民说话，其实是颠倒黑白，无中生有的进行攻击。同时他们在说话时夹插许多马列主义的词句，或是毛主席的语句，以隐藏他们的右派言论的实质，用鱼目混珠或偷天换日的伎俩，来欺骗群众。这是要有坚定的无产阶级立场和敏锐的政治嗅觉才能辨别的，而我却正缺乏这些东西，所以曾一度被其蒙蔽。
    当人民日报开始发出反击右派号召时，我开始以为不必要。但右派分子一连串的阴谋诡计把我惊醒了，认识到右派分子的危害和反击右派的必要。不过又有一个问题我还未搞清，就是温情主义。当我读了人民日报克服温情主义、展开说理斗争的报道时，我想这是对的，我也表示赞同。但当反击曾和我熟识三十多年的右派分子杜镇远的时候，温情主义对我曾起过阻挠作用。本来我是认识杜镇远的丑恶面貌的，也了解到他的一些底的。但是我和他是三十多年的老朋友，有些不便来揭露他。我想最好我来供给资料由别人去揭发他。但是这种温情主义的想法是经不起严正考验的，经过内心的斗争，很快地了解到这种错误思想，必须坚决予以克服，我决定亲自揭露杜镇远的丑恶言行。等我亲身参加了反击右派斗争以后，我感到身心愉快，好像在一件巨大工程中，我也出了一分力。
    我感到党在这次反击右派的斗争中采取透彻说理的方法是极其英明的。有人说当右派分子开始进攻时，党何以未即回击，是否过于放纵，也有人以为这是“诱敌深入”。我看党为了贯彻“鸣放”方针，这样做法是必要的。一方面，那些善意的批评者能畅所欲言，以利改进工作；另一方面，那些毒草，让它长出来，以便铲除，“放纵”有何不好呢？至于说“诱敌深入”，更是无中生有。党邀请党外人士帮助整风，并未把他们当作敌人看待。如果有人把自己看作是敌人，感到是被“诱”上了钩，那正好暴露了他们的真面目。那些右派分子自外于人民，以敌对身分猖狂进攻，他们是冲上来的，怎能说是“诱”呢？是敌人，就应该被围捕消灭，还有什么诱不诱。
    开始反击右派以后，在大大小小的座谈会辩论会上（铁道部的大型座谈会已举行了四十多次，各单位小型座谈会次数更多），发言的人都能针对右派言论摆事实、讲道理，据理驳斥，这是最有力的方法。这样能使听到的人透彻了解到右派言论的危害性和恶毒性，不致被其蒙混。此外采取大字报、壁报等辩论方法，也是极为有效的。
    在这个过程中，在报纸上曾把部分右派言论摘录刊登在“什么话”，“什么画”，“摆出来大家看”等栏。这也帮助大家提高自己的辨别能力。其中有些言论我初读后，并不能识别其危害性，经过反复思考，才了解其影射含义。这也是提高我们的认识和觉悟的好方法，使我们更有力的参加反右派斗争。
    这种以充分说理的方法和右派分子论战，是这次反右派斗争中的重要一环。也是非常有力的一环。右派分子曾诬蔑共产党对于群众是实行“愚民政策”，“高压政策”。说共产党是采用了“民可使由之，不可使知之”的政策，经过这次说理的斗争，所有那些右派胡言，就完全不打自垮了。
    我感到边整边改是这次运动的又一特点。可以说真正做到了说了就做，当场见效。这鼓舞了所有提意见的人的积极性，也给了右派分子一个最有力的事实反击。整风是要扫除宗派主义、主观主义和官僚主义的。边整边改就在整风进行中扫除它们，发现多少扫除多少，能除多少就除多少。即使是当前不能立即解决的，只要是应该解决的，也无不立即进行研究采取措施。我提的关于电子管价格问题，已得到电子管工厂直接给我的答复。言出立行是共产党真正做到的事实，这是宗派主义、主观主义和官僚主义最后必然能除去的保证。这也是我国社会主义建设必成的保证。
    由于反右派斗争采取充分说理的方法，同时整风鸣放又采取了边整边改的积极作法，这就大大提高了广大群众的认识与觉悟。使得所有参加斗争的人的社会主义立场更加坚定，使他们深切体会到反右派斗争是一场必须进行的斗争。在反右派斗争获得胜利以后，继续进行整风，那时必然更为有效。今后各方面工作，必将有更大的改进。我亲身的体会就是认识提高了以后，就能积极投入反右派斗争，更敢于说话，也更敢向一切不正确的言行作斗争了。
