Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 14th. TASS, Cairo: "Al-Ahram" reports that an American plane intruded into Egyptian airspace for reconnaissance on September 12th and was forced to land by the Egyptian Air Force.

"Al-Ahram" said that an American four-engine plane was discovered over a military restricted zone near Cairo on September 12th. The Egyptian side sent radio signals from the ground to notify the plane that it had entered a restricted area. However, the pilot ignored the signal and the plane continued to circle at a low altitude, apparently conducting reconnaissance.

When the Egyptian Air Force forced the plane to land, it landed at Cairo Airport. A group of American officers were on board, including two lieutenant colonels, one major, two captains, and seven non-military personnel. Cameras and film were found on the plane. The Egyptian authorities confiscated the cameras and film and, after an investigation, allowed the American plane to leave Egypt the next day. (Attached picture)

　　美机侵入埃及被强迫降落
    据新华社14日讯  塔斯社开罗讯：“金字塔报”报道，美国飞机在9月12日侵入埃及领空进行侦察，被埃及空军强迫降落。
    “金字塔报”说，9月12日在开罗附近的军事禁区上空发现了美国的一架四引擎飞机。埃及方面从陆上发无线电信号通知这架飞机它已经闯入禁区。但是，驾驶员对这个信号竟置之不理，飞机继续在不很高的上空盘旋，显然是在进行侦察。
    当埃及空军强迫这架飞机降落时，它才在开罗飞机场着陆。飞机上乘着一批美国军官，其中有两名中校，一名少校，两名上尉和七名非军职人员。从飞机上搜出照像机和胶片。埃及当局没收了照像机和胶片，在进行调查之后，允许美国飞机于次日离开埃及。（附图片）
