　　French Government Whitewashes Colonial Policy in Algeria
　　Approves So-Called Fundamental Law for Algeria
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 13th: The French Council of Ministers approved a draft of the “Fundamental Law” regarding the principles of administrative and political reorganization in Algeria at its meeting tonight.
    The law stipulates that Algeria is a "federation" under French rule, that six regions with "autonomy" will be established in Algeria, each region will have a local parliament and local government, and then the local parliaments will appoint members of the Federal Executive Committee. This federal executive body will be a coordinating body for the six regional local parliaments, rather than a central executive body for the entire Algeria. According to this law, Algerian local institutions will only have very limited powers to handle certain internal affairs, while important foreign affairs, judicial, defense, and financial powers will still be held by the French Resident Minister in Algeria.
    It is reported that the French ruling group has had great differences on this "Fundamental Law" proposal. Some socialists attacked the plan as unlikely to solve the Algerian problem. On the other hand, the right-wing group opposes the "Fundamental Law" regarding the establishment of the Federal Executive Body. It is reported that the French cabinet will meet again on the 17th to discuss this draft before submitting it to the National Assembly for review.
    Sources say that due to disagreements over the content of the "Fundamental Law," Minister of Defense Maurice, who opposes the establishment of a federal institution, may resign, which would lead to the resignation of some other Radical Socialist ministers, causing a government crisis.
    Political observers in Paris believe that the government's intention to pass the "Fundamental Law" is by no means to solve the Algerian problem, but simply to hang up a "democratic" signboard to cover up the policies implemented by the French government in Algeria. The French government needs to do this especially on the eve of the United Nations' discussion of the Algerian problem.

### 法国政府粉饰在阿殖民政策批准所谓阿尔及利亚根本法

　　法国政府粉饰在阿殖民政策
　　批准所谓阿尔及利亚根本法
    据新华社巴黎13日电  法国政府全体部长会议今天晚间批准了关于阿尔及利亚行政和政治改组原则的“根本法”的草案。
    这个法案规定阿尔及利亚为法国统治下的一个“联邦”，规定在阿尔及利亚设立六个有“自治权”的区，每个区设立地方议会和地方政府，然后由地方议会来委任组成联邦执行委员会的委员。这个联邦执行机构将成为六个区域地方议会的统筹机构，而不是整个阿尔及利亚的中央执行机构。根据这个法案，阿尔及利亚的地方机构只有处理某一些内政问题的极有限的权力，而重要的外交、司法、国防和财政权仍然由法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节代表总揽。
    据报道，法国统治集团在这项“根本法”方案上发生了很大的分歧。某些社会党人攻击这项方案不可能解决阿尔及利亚问题。另方面，右翼集团反对“根本法”关于设立联邦执行机构的条款。据报道，法国内阁17日把这个草案提交国民议会审议以前将再次开会讨论。
    有消息说，由于在“根本法”内容上的分歧，反对设立联邦机构的国防部长摩里斯有可能提出辞职，这样就会连带引起其他一些激进社会党部长的辞职，造成政府危机。
    巴黎政治观察家认为，政府所以想通过“根本法”，其目的绝不是要解决阿尔及利亚问题，而只是挂起一种“民主”招牌来掩饰法国政府在阿尔及利亚所执行的政策。法国政府在联合国讨论阿尔及利亚问题的前夕特别需要这样做。
