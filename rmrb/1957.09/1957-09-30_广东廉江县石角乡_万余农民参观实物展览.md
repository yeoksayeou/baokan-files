Guangdong Lianjiang County, Shijiao Township

Over Ten Thousand Farmers Visit a Real Object Exhibition

(Reported by this newspaper) In the socialist propaganda and education movement in Shijiao Township, Lianjiang County, Guangdong Province, the township used its own authentic and vivid materials to create various paintings and held a "Socialism Superiority Exhibition" in mid-August. In less than ten days, more than 10,000 farmers visited it. Farmers from two neighboring townships in Guangxi Province also came to visit.

The exhibition was rich in content. It included a comparison of the production and life of farmers in the township before and after liberation, charts of the township's production plans, and an introduction to the inhuman lives of Taiwanese farmers under the cruel exploitation of the U.S.-Chiang regime. The pictures illustrated that after the cooperative transformation of the township, the average yield per mu of land in the entire township had increased from 251 jin to 314 jin, and the living standards of 2,106 households in the township had significantly improved. Only a small number of people who used to live by exploitation and rely on improper income such as superstitious occupations had incomes lower than before.

After visiting the exhibition, the farmers greatly improved their awareness. Many poor farmers said: Now we have a way to refute capitalist ideas.

    广东廉江县石角乡
    万余农民参观实物展览
    本报讯　广东省廉江县石角乡在社会主义宣传教育运动中，利用该乡真实而生动的材料，画成各种图画，在8月中旬，举办了一个“社会主义优越性展览会”。不到十天时间，就有一万多农民去参观。毗邻的广西省亦有两个乡的农民来参观。
    展览会内容很丰富。有该乡解放前后农民的生产生活的对比，有乡里的生产规划的图表，还有现在台湾农民受美蒋残酷剥削下的非人生活的情况介绍。图片说明了该乡合作化后，全乡每亩田平均产量已由二百五十一斤增到三百十四斤，全乡二千一百零六户生活水平显著提高，只有少数人过去靠剥削为生和靠迷信职业等不正当收入的人收入比不上从前。
    农民参观了展览会后，觉悟大大提高。许多贫苦农民说：现在有办法驳倒资本主义思想了。
