Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Joint Communiqué of Film Delegations from Asian Countries Participating in the Asian Film Week Sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the China Film Workers Association

    The "Asian Film Week" held in ten cities including Beijing in the People's Republic of China in 1957 has been a resounding success! All members of the delegations from the Union of Burma, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of India, the Republic of Indonesia, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Lebanon, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Syrian Republic, the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, Thailand, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who participated in this historically significant event, would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the China Film Workers Association, which were responsible for organizing the "Asian Film Week".
    The exchange of films is not only an exchange of film art and film technology, but it also breaks through the limitations of language and customs, making a great contribution to the friendship and unity between the peoples of all countries.
    All members of the film delegations from the fourteen Asian countries gathered here hope that the "Asian Film Week" will not be held only once, and that it should be held in rotation in various countries every year in the future. Starting next year, its scope should be expanded and developed into an "Asian-African Film Festival".
    We believe that the holding of the "Asian-African Film Festival" will surely promote the prosperity of the film industry in Asian and African countries, and will help to develop friendship between the peoples of Asian and African countries and maintain world peace.

    希望明年发展为亚非电影节
    新华社8日讯　参加中国人民对外文化协会、中国电影工作者联谊会主办的亚洲电影周各国电影代表团联合公报
    1957年在中华人民共和国北京等十大城市举行的“亚洲电影周”，获得了空前的成功！参加了这一有重大历史意义的活动的缅甸联邦、柬埔寨王国、中华人民共和国、印度共和国、印度尼西亚共和国、日本、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、黎巴嫩共和国、蒙古人民共和国、巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国、叙利亚共和国、塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国、泰国和越南民主共和国的代表团全体人员，谨向积极支持举办“亚洲电影周”的中华人民共和国政府和负责组织工作的中国人民对外文化协会和中国电影工作者联谊会表示深切的谢意。
    电影的交流，不仅是电影艺术和电影技术的交流，它也突破了语言和风俗习惯的限制，为各国人民之间的友谊和团结做出巨大的贡献。
    在这里集合的亚洲十四个国家的电影代表团全体人员希望“亚洲电影周”不止举行这一次，今后应该每年在各国轮流举办。从明年起，并应扩大其范围，发展成为“亚非电影节”。
    我们相信，“亚非电影节”的举行，必将促进亚非各国电影事业的繁荣，并将有助于发展亚非各国人民之间的友谊和维护世界和平。
