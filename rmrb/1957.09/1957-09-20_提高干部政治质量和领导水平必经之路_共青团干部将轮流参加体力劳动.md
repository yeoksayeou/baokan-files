Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China has requested that leadership organs of the Youth League at all levels, within six to seven years, adopt a method of rotating cadres in batches to basically ensure that all cadres are sent to rural areas or factories to participate in one to two years of physical labor. This was pointed out in the "Decision on Organizing Cadres to Participate in Physical Labor in Rotation by Stages and in Groups" issued by the Central Committee of the Youth League on the 18th.

The decision pointed out that the Communist Youth League already has a cadre force of considerable size. The vast majority of cadres in Youth League committees at all levels are active, energetic, supportive of the Party's leadership, and possess a certain level of socialist ideological awareness. However, it must also be recognized that most of the cadres in the Youth League are intellectual youths from petty-bourgeois or exploiting-class families. Many of them have not worked at the grassroots level, have not directly engaged in physical labor, lack the tempering of arduous struggle, lack the feelings of the worker-peasant masses, and lack knowledge of the lives of the worker-peasant masses and of industrial and agricultural production. This weakness of the Youth League's cadre force seriously affects the further improvement of the Youth League's quality and its work and leadership levels. In order to improve the quality of the cadre force, in addition to constantly paying attention to cultivating and selecting outstanding young workers and peasants to participate in the leadership of Youth League committees at all levels, the most important method is to systematically arrange for the existing Youth League cadres, in batches and in rotation, to participate in industrial and agricultural production and in the actual struggles of factories or rural areas while strengthening Marxist-Leninist ideological education. They can then return to take on Youth League leadership work after obtaining the qualifications of workers or peasants. Through approaching the worker-peasant masses and the tempering and transformation of productive labor, it is possible for them to become familiar with the lives of workers and peasants, understand production knowledge, firmly establish the proletarian stand and viewpoint, overcome bourgeois individualism, and cultivate a work style of closely linking with the masses and proceeding from reality. Even veteran cadres within the League who joined the revolution earlier and have engaged in labor tempering should frequently participate in physical labor and approach the worker-peasant masses. The experience of our Party's construction proves that this is the inevitable path to improving cadres' political quality and leadership level.

The Central Committee of the Youth League believes that organizing cadres to participate in physical labor should involve going to rural areas and more difficult places. This is more conducive to the tempering and transformation of cadres. Cadres participating in labor should accept the leadership of the local Party organizations at the grassroots level, eat and live with the peasants and workers, and live at the same level, without any special treatment. Moreover, most people should not be assigned to leadership positions in grassroots units at the beginning. In order to facilitate the Youth League's leadership organs to understand the situation at the lower levels through the dispatch of cadres, improve and strengthen guidance on work, and assist local Party committees in managing the dispatched cadres, the Youth League's leadership organs should pay attention to equipping some leading cadres who have been tested through labor tempering and actual struggle to go down together to participate in the leadership work of the local Party committees and Youth League committees while laboring.

For cadres who are not currently scheduled to go down, the Central Committee of the Youth League requires them to participate in labor tempering in the following ways: 1. Each year, they should go to rural areas or factories to participate in a concentrated period of physical labor, such as one week, half a month, or one month. 2. Each week or month, they should set aside a certain amount of time, such as half a day, one day, or two days, to go to rural areas or factories to participate in labor or engage in other public welfare labor. 3. They should regularly participate in certain cleaning, sanitation, or other internal affairs labor in the organs.

The decision concludes by expressing the hope that the leadership organs of the Youth League at all levels will attach great importance to and earnestly implement the above-mentioned measures.

### 提高干部政治质量和领导水平必经之路  共青团干部将轮流参加体力劳动

　　提高干部政治质量和领导水平必经之路
　　共青团干部将轮流参加体力劳动
    新华社19日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会要求各级团的领导机关在六、七年内，采用分期分批的办法，基本上做到把所有干部都放到农村或工厂，参加一年到两年的体力劳动。这是团中央在18日发布的关于分期分批组织干部参加体力劳动的决定中指出的。
    决定指出，现在共青团已经有了一支具有相当数量的干部队伍，各级团委机关的绝大多数干部，都是积极肯干、朝气蓬勃、拥护党的领导、有一定社会主义思想觉悟的。但是，也要看到，团的干部队伍中大部分人是出身于小资产阶级或剥削阶级家庭的知识青年，有许多人没有做过基层工作，没有直接从事过体力劳动，缺少艰苦斗争的锻炼，缺少工农群众的感情，缺少工农群众生活和工农业生产的知识。团的干部队伍的这种弱点，严重地影响着团的质量和团的工作水平同领导水平的进一步提高。为着提高干部队伍的质量，除了要经常注意培养和选拔优秀的青年工人和农民参加各级团委的领导以外，最主要的办法就是，在加强马克思列宁主义思想教育的同时，有计划地使现有的团的干部，分期分批地轮流去参加工农业生产，参加工厂或农村的实际斗争，取得工人或农民的资格以后再回来担任团的领导工作。通过接近工农群众和生产劳动的锻炼和改造，就可能使他们熟悉工人和农民的生活，懂得生产知识，巩固地树立起无产阶级的立场和观点，克服资产阶级个人主义的思想，养成密切联系群众、从实际出发的工作作风。就是团内少数参加革命较早和从事过劳动锻炼的老干部，也应当经常参加体力劳动和接近工农群众。我们党的建设经验证明，这是提高干部的政治质量和领导水平的必经之路。
    团中央认为，组织干部参加体力劳动，应当是去农村和比较艰苦的地方，这样才利于对干部的锻炼和改造。参加劳动的干部应当接受所在的基层单位党组织的领导，一律和农民、工人同吃、同住，过同等水平的生活，不得特殊化；并且大多数人在开始的时候，不宜于担任基层单位的领导工作。为了便于团的领导机关通过下放干部了解下层情况，改进和加强对工作的指导，并且为了协助地方党委对下放干部进行管理，团的领导机关应该注意配备一些经过劳动锻炼和实际斗争考验的领导骨干一起下去，一边劳动，一边参加地方党委、团委的领导工作。
    对于当前没有轮到下去的干部，团中央要求他们用以下几种方式参加劳动锻炼：一、每年都到农村或工厂去集中地参加一个时期的体力劳动，如一个星期、半个月或一个月。二、每周或每月抽出一定时间如半天、一天、两天，去农村或工厂参加劳动，或进行其他的公益劳动。三、在机关里经常参加一定的清洁、卫生或其他内务劳动。
    决定最后希望各级团委领导机关都能高度重视和认真执行上面提出的措施。
