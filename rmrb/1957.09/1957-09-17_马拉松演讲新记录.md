　　New Record for Marathon Speech
    Recently, during the US Congress's debate on the Civil Rights Act, Southern Senator Strom Thurmond delivered a record-breaking "marathon speech" lasting twenty-four hours and eighteen minutes. The following description from the American "Newsweek" exposes the bizarre aspects of American parliamentary "democracy."
    At 8:54 PM on August 28th, Strom Thurmond rose to speak in Congress. He began by reading the election laws of forty-eight American states—from Alabama to Wyoming. At one o'clock after midnight, Congressman Goldwater asked him to pause for a moment to make a note in the Congressional Record. Thurmond gladly agreed and used these few minutes to go to the restroom (he only went once during the entire speech). After returning, Thurmond continued speaking. Only three people remained in the audience.
    At 9:00 AM on August 29th, Thurmond was still muttering and continuing his speech. He occasionally sipped orange juice and loudly chewed rye bread and fried chicken pieces cut into squares. At 1:40 PM, Thurmond announced, "I have been speaking for seventeen hours, and my spirits are still high!" At 9:12 PM, twenty-four hours and eighteen minutes had passed since Thurmond began speaking. Thurmond finally concluded his speech.

### 马拉松演讲新记录

　　马拉松演讲新记录
    最近美国国会举行有关民权法案的辩论时，南方参议员斯特罗姆·色尔蒙发表了长达二十四小时零十八分的、破记录的“马拉松演讲”。下面这段美国“新闻周刊”对当时情况的描述，暴露了美国议会“民主”的怪相。
    8月28日下午八点五十四分，斯特罗姆·色尔蒙在国会起立发言，他一开始就宣读美国四十八个州——从亚拉巴马州起到怀俄明州为止的选举法条文。午夜以后一点钟，众议员戈尔德瓦特请他暂停片刻，以便在国会记录上登个记。色尔蒙欣然同意，并且利用这几分钟的时间去上厕所（在整个演讲过程里他只去了一次）。转来以后，色尔蒙继续发言。听众席只剩下了三个人。
    8月29日上午九时，色尔蒙还在唧唧咕咕地继续发言。他不时呷一口橘子水，大声咀嚼切成方块的裸麦面包和油炸鸡块。下午一点四十分，色尔蒙宣布说：“我已经讲了十七小时了，我的精神还挺好哩！”下午九点十二分，距离色尔蒙开始发言时，已经二十四小时十八分了。色尔蒙才结束了演讲。
