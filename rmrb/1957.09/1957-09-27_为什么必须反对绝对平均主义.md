Why must we oppose absolute egalitarianism?

What is the objective role of absolute egalitarianism? This must be viewed from a specific historical context. In exploitative class societies, absolute egalitarianism, based on small-scale production, possesses both revolutionary and reactionary qualities. For example, in the anti-feudal land reform, the peasants' absolute egalitarianism was like this. Their demand to equally distribute the land and wealth of the feudal landlord class was revolutionary and correct in that aspect. However, their demand to equally distribute the land property of all other classes, all strata of peasants, and all other people in society, and to equally distribute industry and commerce, was reactionary. Because the result of such equal distribution would not be to increase social productivity, but to cause it to regress. It would not only fail to thoroughly liberate the peasants but would also undermine the effort to achieve socialism, thus moving away from the path of their complete liberation. Therefore, in leading the reform of the land system, our Party resolutely supported the peasants' demand to equally distribute the land and wealth of the feudal landlord class, leading them to struggle and realize it. At the same time, we resolutely persuaded them not to demand the equal distribution of all material means of production.

During the socialist revolution, absolute egalitarianism can only play a reactionary role. The socialist revolution aims to abolish private ownership of the means of production and implement public ownership of the means of production. In the distribution of the means of livelihood, it implements the principle of "to each according to his work," that is, distributing the means of livelihood according to the quantity and quality of each person's labor, and those who do not work shall not eat (of course, the elderly, the disabled, and others without the ability to work are exceptions). Distribution is determined by economic conditions. In the first stage of communism—socialist society—the principle of "to each according to his work" is the only correct principle. Absolute egalitarianism, on the other hand, advocates absolute equality in distribution and livelihood, regardless of the quality or quantity of labor. Labor models and loafers enjoy the same living standards. Clearly, this directly opposes the principle of "to each according to his work," that is, it opposes the socialist system. Therefore, at this time, it can only play a reactionary role. (Excerpted from Guan Feng's "Why We Must Oppose Absolute Egalitarianism," Beijing Daily, September 20th)

### 为什么必须反对绝对平均主义

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    为什么必须反对绝对平均主义
    绝对平均主义的客观作用是怎样的呢？这要从一定的历史条件来看。在剥削阶级的社会里，以小生产为基础的绝对平均主义，具有革命的与反动的两重性质。例如在反封建的土地改革中，农民的绝对平均主义就是这样。他们要求平分封建地主阶级的土地财富，就这方面说是革命的、正确的。但是，他们还要求平分社会上其他一切阶级、农民一切阶层和其他一切人的土地财产，平分工商业，这就是反动的了。因为这样平分的结果，将不是提高社会的生产力，而是使社会生产力倒退，它不仅不会使农民得到彻底的解放，而且会破坏了争取社会主义的实现，也就是远离开了彻底解放自己的道路。所以我们党在领导改革土地制度中，一方面坚决支持农民平分封建地主阶级的土地财富的要求，领导他们去斗争、去实现；一方面坚决说服他们不要要求平分一切物质生产资料。
    在社会主义革命时期，绝对平均主义就只能起反动作用了。社会主义革命是要废除生产资料私有制，实行生产资料公有制的；在生活资料的分配上，实行“按劳取酬”的原则，即按着每个人的劳动的数量和质量分配生活资料，而不劳动者则不得食（当然，老年人、残废者等没有劳动能力的人，是不在此例的）。分配是由经济状况决定的。在共产主义的第一阶段——社会主义社会，“按劳取酬”的分配原则是唯一正确的原则。而绝对平均主义，则主张在分配上、生活上实行绝对平均，不管劳动的质量、数量怎样，劳动模范和懒汉，都享受一样的生活待遇。很显然，这是直接反对“按劳取酬”的原则的；也就是说，是反对社会主义制度的。所以说，在这个时候它只能起反动作用了。（摘自9月20日北京日报关锋：“为什么必须反对绝对平均主义”）
