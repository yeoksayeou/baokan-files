    Ten "Many"s
    In our materials section, there are many leaders,
    Four people in charge, not much responsibility they bear.
    And five section chiefs, busy as bees and many.
    Within the section's work, many problems occur frequently.
    In solving problems, many differences in opinion exist.
    When requesting funds and making plans, the amounts requested are many.
    The materials purchased, inventory increases monthly in many.
    Using horse carts to transport materials, much waste occurs everywhere.
    We request that leaders, go deep into the lower levels in many,
    Seize hold of the work, and solve the above eight "many"s.

    十个多
    我们材料科，科的领导多，
    四位负责人，工作负不多。
    还有五股长，忙忙碌碌多。
    科内的工作，发生问题多。
    解决问题中，意见分歧多。
    用款提计划，金额做的多。
    购入的材料，库存月增多。
    马车运材料，处处浪费多。
    请求领导上，深入下层多，
    工作抓起来，解决上八多。
