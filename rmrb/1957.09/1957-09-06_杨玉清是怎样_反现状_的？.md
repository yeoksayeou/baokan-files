Yang Yuqing, a rightist, shouted at a symposium in legal circles: "The pen of a scholar is naturally against the status quo, not for praising merits and virtues." Now, let's see how Yang Yuqing, who calls himself a "scholar," "naturally opposes the status quo"!

When Yang Yuqing studied in Japan, he published reactionary articles praising Fascism, such as "An Examination of the Political Science of Fascism" and "Discussion on China's Future Political System," in Dagong Bao and "Guowen Weekly," and was appreciated by cultural secret agent Liu Bomin. After returning to China in 1933, Liu Bomin introduced him as the editor-in-chief of "Japan Review." From this, he colluded with the "Reorganization Clique," gained the favor of the great traitor Wang Jingwei, and was placed as a secretary in the Kuomintang Embassy in France. After returning to China in 1937, the "Reorganization Clique" lost power, and he turned to the "CC Clique," serving as the chief of the Cultural Affairs Section of the Social Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee, specializing in anti-communist and anti-people cultural activities. He was valued by the likes of Chen Lifu and Zhang Daofan, and was hired as a professor at the pseudo-Central Political School. He also served as the director of the Compilation and Examination Department of the Kuomintang Central Training Committee. Later, he became associated with Kang Ze, the head of the military intelligence, and became an alternate officer and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Headquarters of the Three People's Principles Youth League. Thanks to Chen Bulei's support, he also served as the president and editor-in-chief of the "Three People's Principles Bi-Weekly" for several years, becoming a vanguard on the theoretical front of the reactionaries against the Communist Party and the people. He even participated in the "Imperial Conference" planned by Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the democratic movement. As a reward for his contributions, this "scholar" even managed to become a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee. When Chiang Kai-shek engaged in the pseudo-"National Assembly," he was "elected" as a pseudo-legislator with the support of intelligence heads such as Kang Ze. After the Chiang regime collapsed and fled to Guangzhou, he still followed the "small court" with official addiction, serving as a pseudo-Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Justice, and then fled to Hong Kong. It is not difficult to see from Yang Yuqing's "illustrious" history that Yang Yuqing is not only a consistent pro-Kuomintang "scholar," but also a reactionary opportunistic politician who would latch onto anyone who offered him something.

How did he carry out anti-communist and anti-people activities from the "theoretical" front? Here, let's take a look at a few articles he published in the "Three People's Principles Bi-Weekly."

During the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, Yang Yuqing tried his best to defend the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship and opposed the correct proposition of establishing a "coalition government" in his article "Party Reform and National Revival." He said: "It seems that if the Party (Kuomintang) could hand over power, the War of Resistance would immediately be won, and China would be permanently stable and secure. All of this, when we think about it, is it fair? I feel that the Party is a product of Chinese society, and the Party members are all Chinese; instead of blaming the Party, it is better to blame Chinese society, and instead of blaming the Party members, it is better to blame the Chinese people." See, he shamelessly pushed all the responsibilities of the reactionaries' disastrous actions upon the Chinese people, insisting that the Chinese people be responsible for Chiang Kai-shek's crimes.

He not only did not "oppose" the "status quo" under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, but also妄想 (wang xiang, foolishly hoped) to maintain this "status quo" for all time. He said, "In the future constitutional era, the Kuomintang will still occupy a leading position in politics."

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary civil war and surrendered to American imperialism. A nationwide upsurge of anti-Chiang and anti-American sentiment was set off. In addition to organizing the publication of a series of reactionary articles in the "Three People's Principles Bi-Weekly" to defend Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous actions, Yang Yuqing also "praised" the "merit" of the United States in his own article "Analysis and Diagnosis of the Domestic and International Situation," saying: "Americans feel that the more hunger and chaos there is, the more they are willing to make up for the deficiencies of others with the excess of the United States." In this article, he also wantonly slandered the Soviet Union, the loyal friend of the Chinese people, and pinned the responsibility for the international tension created by American imperialism on the Soviet Union, which has always defended peace, hoping to ease the people's anti-American anger by spreading rumors and inciting anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiments.

Regarding the anti-Chiang and anti-American movement of the youth across the country at that time, in his article "The Calamity of Youth," he advised the youth: "Only by settling your minds can you seek progress. The surrounding environment, of course, you may not be used to it; but sometimes you need to be patient. Everything in China is growing and has not yet matured, your standards cannot be too high. Remember: stability! stability! If the school does not allow you to be stable, you must seek stability yourself, and you must never create chaos and disturbances in stability." At that time, he was afraid that the youth would "oppose the status quo," and persuaded them to be content with the status quo. How to be content with the status quo? He said: "The only things that can convince people are knowledge, morality, and technology. Shouting slogans and posting slogans have lost their effect today." He妄想 (wang xiang, foolishly hoped) to use this to numb the youth, so that they would not ask about politics and return to the classroom to become bookworms, so that Chiang Kai-shek could rest assured to sell out the country and fight a civil war.

Yang Yuqing touted that he opposed praising merits and virtues, so let's see how the editor-in-chief of this "Three People's Principles Bi-Weekly" slapped himself in the face. Yang Yuqing said in his own "Feelings on the 50th Anniversary of the Party's Founding": "Our party is fifty years old, we are unwilling to simply praise its merits and virtues, we want to pray for it: eternal youth, eternal youth"! In the article "On Government Reorganization," he said: "The Kuomintang has been in power for twenty years, its doctrine, its political program, and its leadership direction, in all fairness, are all good." In the postscript to Volume 1, Issue 12 of the "Three People's Principles Bi-Weekly" in 1942, he also said: "The President (Chiang Kai-shek) has given many instructions to the people in the past ten years; the President's instructions can be inexhaustible and inexhaustible if they are put into practice; if everyone can take the President's heart as their own, even if they are not completely correct, they will not be far off."

Enough, this alone is enough to completely see Yang Yuqing's slavish appearance of "praising" the "virtues" of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, and slandering and attacking the revolutionary people of China and the Soviet Union.

After liberation, the Party and the people forgave him and gave him considerable important work and living care. But how did he treat the people and the Party?

In 1950, he went to the Political Research Institute of the former North China Revolutionary University to study, but he slandered it as entering a "madhouse." In 1951, he participated in the land reform work team. When he saw the peasants fighting the landlords, he sympathized with the landlords, saying that the struggle was too extreme and pouring cold water on the peasants.

This spring, he returned to Wuhan to "visit relatives"; but according to his later confession, he went to Wuhan to try to achieve his personal ambitions: to "lay the foundation" for being elected as a representative to the National People's Congress or a member of the CPPCC in the future. He contacted some rightists there and collected some materials for attacking the Party. After returning to Beijing, he wrote an anti-Party article entitled "Wuhan is Growing," which he asked the People's Daily, which he opposed, to publish (the People's Daily did not adopt it). In this article, he fabricated facts and viciously slandered the Party, government, and people of Wuhan. He said: "The people of Wuhan are not highly conscious, and the Party and government of Wuhan are divorced from the masses." He also maliciously distorted the fact that Wuhan's "implementation of the two-part system in primary and secondary schools is the root cause of juvenile delinquency." Therefore, he clamored for the people of Wuhan to have a "great social reform." He used this article to shoot the first poisonous arrow to attack the Party.

After the start of the rectification movement, he believed that the time for a large-scale attack on the Party had come, and he acted even more blatantly. He roared everywhere, openly clamoring against land reform, judicial reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and ideological remolding. At the symposium of non-Party people convened by the State Council and the symposium of legal circles, he more frantically attacked the Party Central Committee, saying: "The Party and the government are not separated, and the central government is the root. The problem lies in the central government, we must hit the big ones, hit the hard ones"! He wanted to "break the Party's horns and criticize the Party's scales." He also slandered at the rectification symposium of the "Political Science and Law Research" editorial department: "The editor-in-chief is not competent, the editor-in-chief treats everyone as slaves, it is 'one general succeeds and ten thousand bones wither'." He revealed his deep hatred for the Chinese Communist Party, hoping to incite all rightists to rise up against the Party, overthrow the Party's leadership in one fell swoop, and realize his异想 (yi xiang, fantasy) of "whoever has the conditions can do it"!

This leads to the conclusion: what Yang Yuqing "naturally" wants to "oppose" is just the "status quo" of the great New Democratic Revolution and Socialist Revolution led by the great Chinese Communist Party and supported by the people of the whole country. As for the "status quo" of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China ruled by the reactionaries, he not only does not "naturally" "oppose" it, but also wants to "praise its merits and virtues" and do his best to serve it, and still dreams of restoring it, and making it last for thousands of years, "forever young"!

But contrary to his wishes, Yang Yuqing's "dream" has been shattered again!

    杨玉清是怎样“反现状”的？
    仁民
    右派分子杨玉清在法学界座谈会上大喊：“文人的笔杆是天然反现状的，不是歌功颂德的。”那么，现在我们就来看看自命为“文人”的杨玉清是如何“天然反现状”的吧！
    杨玉清在日本留学时，就在大公报和“国闻周报”上先后发表了颂扬法西斯主义的“法西斯主义之政治学的考查”、“今后中国政治制度商榷”等反动文章，得到文化特务刘百闵的赏识。1933年回国后，刘百闵就介绍他作“日本评论”的主编。他由此勾搭上“改组派”，获得了大汉奸汪精卫的青睐，被安置在国民党驻法大使馆作秘书。1937年回国后，“改组派”失势，他又投靠“CC”，任国民党中央党部社会部文化事业科科长，专门从事反共、反人民的文化事业活动，受到陈立夫、张道藩之流的器重，被聘为伪中央政治学校教授，还曾任国民党中央训练委员会编审处处长。后来，他又和军统特务头子康泽挂上了钩，当上了三民主义青年团中央团部候补干事和宣传处副处长。他还由于陈布雷的支持，干了好几年的“三民主义半月刊”社长兼总编辑；成为反动派反共、反人民理论战线上的急先锋，并且因而参加了蒋介石策划镇压民主运动的“御前会议”。论功行赏，这位“文人”也居然捞上了一名国民党的中央委员。蒋介石搞伪“国大”时，他由于康泽等特务头子的支持，“竞选”上了一名伪立法委员。蒋政权溃败逃亡到广州后，他还官瘾十足地跟着“小朝庭”，作了一任伪司法行政部政务次长，以后又逃往香港。从杨玉清的“显赫”历史中不难看出：杨玉清不但是一个一贯反共的御用“文人”，而且也是个有奶便是娘的反动投机政客。
    他是怎样从“理论”战线上进行反共、反人民的呢？这里仅就他发表在“三民主义半月刊”上的几篇文章来看一下。
    抗日战争后期，杨玉清在“党的改造与国的复兴”一文中极力为国民党的一党专政辩护，反对建立“联合政府”的正确主张。他说：“好像本党（国民党）如能交出政权，抗战就会即刻胜利，中国就会长治久安似的。这一切的一切，我们想想，是否平情之论！我觉得本党是中国社会的产物，本党党员也都是中国人；与其责备本党，不如责备中国社会，与其责备本党党员，不如责备中国人”。看，他竟无耻地把反动派一切祸国殃民的责任，都推到中国人民身上，硬要中国人民代蒋介石的罪行负责。
    他不但不“反”蒋介石统治下的“现状”，还妄想把这个“现状”维持到万古千秋。说什么“将来宪政时期，国民党仍居政治上的领导地位。”
    抗战胜利之后，蒋介石发动了反革命的内战，向美帝国主义投靠卖国。全国人民掀起了反蒋反美的怒潮。杨玉清这时除了在“三民主义半月刊”组织发表了一系列的反动文章，来为蒋介石的卖国行为辩护以外，还在他自己写的“国内外局势的分析和诊断”一文中“歌颂”美国之“功德”，说：“美国人觉得愈是饥饿，愈是混乱；所以，他们不惜以美国之有余补他人之不足”。在这篇文章中，他并且对中国人民的忠实朋友苏联横加诋毁，把美帝制造国际紧张局势的责任，硬套在一贯维护和平的苏联的头上，希图以造谣来缓和人民的反美怒潮，煽动反苏、反共的情绪。
    对于当时全国青年的反蒋反美运动，他在“青年的灾难”一文中，向青年们劝告说：“惟有把心安定下来，才能求进步。周围的环境，固然会自己看不惯；但有时需要忍耐。中国一切正在生长，还没有成熟，你们的尺度不能太高。记着：安定！安定！学校不让你们安定，你们要自己求定，切不可自己于安定中造动乱，造纷扰”。那时，他怕的是青年们“反现状”，劝说他们安于现状。如何安于现状呢？他说：“惟一足以服人的，是学问，是德行，是技术。喊口号，贴标语，在今天失掉了作用”。他妄想以此来麻醉青年，使他们不问政治，回到教室去作书呆子，好让蒋介石放心去卖国打内战。
    杨玉清是标榜反对歌功颂德的，那么，我们就来看看这位“三民主义半月刊”的总编辑怎样自打嘴巴吧。杨玉清在他亲笔写的“本党立党五十周年述感”中说：“本党五十岁了，我们对它不愿做寻常的歌功颂德，我们要祈祷它：永远的少壮，永远的年青”！在“论政府改组”一文中，他说：“国民党执政已二十年，它的主义，它的政纲，它的领导方向，平心论之，都是好的。”在1942年的“三民主义半月刊”一卷十二期编后记里又说：“总裁（蒋介石）十余年来，对国人的诏示很多；本（原文在这里空一格，以示尊敬）总裁的昭示以力行之，可以终身取之不尽，用之不竭；大家能以总裁之心为心，虽不中不远矣。”
    够了，仅此已完全可以看出杨玉清“歌”美蒋之“德”、诬蔑和攻击中国革命人民和苏联的一副奴才相了。
    解放以后，党和人民宽恕了他，给他相当重要的工作和生活照顾。然而他对人民对党又是怎么样呢？
    1950年，他到前华北革命大学政治研究院学习，却诬蔑说是进了“疯人院”。1951年，他参加过土改工作队，当他看到农民斗争地主时，却同情地主，说斗得太过火了，给农民泼冷水。
    今年春天，他曾回到武汉去“省亲”；但据他后来交代，到武汉去是为了设法达到个人野心：为将来能够当选全国人代大会代表或政协委员“打底子”。他在那里曾与某些右派分子接触，搜集了向党进攻的一些资料。回京以后，他写了一篇题为“武汉在成长中”的反党文章，曾要求他所反对的人民日报发表（人民日报没有采用）。在这篇文章中，他捏造事实，恶毒诋毁武汉的党、政和人民。他说：“武汉人民觉悟不高，武汉党政脱离群众”。他还恶意歪曲说，武汉“实行中小学二部制是产生青少年犯罪的根源”。因此，他叫嚣武汉人民要来一次“伟大的社会改革”。他用这篇文章射出了向党进攻的第一支毒箭。
    在整风运动开始后，他认为大举向党进攻的时机已到，便更露骨地活动起来。他到处大肆咆哮，公开叫喊反对土地改革，反对司法改革，反对肃反运动，反对思想改造。他在国务院召开的党外人士座谈会上和法学界座谈会上，更猖狂的向党中央进攻，说：“党政不分，中央是根。问题在于中央，要打大的，打硬的”！他要“折党之角，批党之鳞”。他在“政法研究”编辑部整风座谈会上也诬蔑说：“总编辑不称职，总编辑把大家当成奴隶，是‘一将成功万骨枯’”。他对中国共产党，露出了切齿的仇恨，希图煽动一切右派分子起来反对党，一举打垮党的领导，实现他叫嚣的“谁有条件谁来干”的异想！
    这就可以作出结论：原来杨玉清“天然”要“反”的，就只是伟大的中国共产党所领导的、全国人民所拥护的新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的“现状”。至于反动派统治的半封建半殖民地旧中国的“现状”，他不但“天然”不“反”，却还要“歌功颂德”，百般效劳，至今仍梦想着让它复辟，而且千秋万岁，“永远年青”哩！
    但事与愿违，杨玉清的“美梦”又破产了！
