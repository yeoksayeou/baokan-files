    Talking about Not Performing Bad Plays and the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    Mei Lanfang
    Gansu is one of the birthplaces of Qinqiang opera, with many old Qinqiang artists and a rich treasure of opera. Now, it is also being built into the industrial base of the motherland, and everything is developing rapidly. We can learn a lot by performing here. Before liberation, due to inconvenient transportation, I never even dreamed of coming to Lanzhou; according to the transportation situation at that time, it was difficult for distant troupes to perform here. Only today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, can the worker comrades pave the way for us with their labor, so that we can come to Lanzhou, meet with the working people here, and learn something from everyone. Such happiness was brought to us by the Communist Party, and we should thank the Chinese Communist Party.
    This time when I came to Lanzhou, I happened to be in time for the symposium held by the comrades in the opera circles of Gansu Province. As an opera actor, it is our duty to talk about some views on opera art. But I am very sorry that I don't have time to prepare well during the performance period. If I say something wrong, I hope the comrades will give me guidance.
    I would like to talk about the opening up of repertoire and the issue of not performing bad plays first. I know that everyone is very concerned about this issue. Some people may think this way: the government has explicitly ordered the opening of banned plays, which means that any play can be performed. Why do we still propose not to perform bad plays? Also, what kind of play is considered a good play, what kind of play is considered a bad play, and what is the difference between them? Everyone wants to figure out these questions. Below are my personal opinions.
    The Ministry of Culture, in accordance with the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," announced that all traditional repertoires would be opened, which solved the problem of the lack of performance repertoires, and allowed many old plays to meet the audience again. Some traditional and excellent scripts, dances, tunes and musical pieces have also appeared on the stage and have been welcomed by the audience. Therefore, the lives and work of the actors have also been improved accordingly, which has greatly promoted the development and prosperity of opera art. However, the government's purpose in opening up the repertoire is not to encourage everyone to perform bad plays, let alone to let us go backward, but to better promote the fine traditions of our opera art. The government does not use administrative orders to ban bad plays, which does not mean that there are no standards for good and bad in art. Rather, it is because our actors have improved their political thinking, and the Party and the government trust us and give us the power to decide on the plays to be performed. Then we should consider the effect of the performance. When performing a play, we must see what kind of role it plays among the audience. The people call today's actors "engineers of the human soul." How glorious is this title, and how important is the task given to us? When we sort out the traditional repertoire, how can we not make a selection? We advocate good repertoires that are rich in ideological and artistic value. We firmly oppose the performance of bad repertoires that have no value in content and performance, or even are harmful to the physical and mental health of the people. Therefore, the government's opening of the repertoire is not contradictory to our proposal of not performing bad plays. Opening up the repertoire is to promote the fine traditions of opera art, and not performing bad plays is to make more and more flowers appear on the stage more quickly.
    On the one hand, we should adhere to the policy of boldly and freely exploring the repertoire; on the other hand, we must seriously and responsibly treat the plays to be performed. Which repertoires can be staged unchanged, which repertoires must be appropriately modified, and which repertoires are not worth modifying all need to be carefully studied and discussed.
    Things with reactionary political views, and things that are ugly, obscene, terrifying, and harmful to the physical and mental health of the people, and these toxins occupy a major position in the script, and there is no play after removing them. For this type of repertoire, I don't think it's necessary to waste time sorting it out. For example, some commonly performed plays in the Kunqu opera legend "Tie Guan Tu" have their writing skills from the script point of view, and there are also some unique artistic skills in the performance. However, the author's position is to oppose the peasant uprising and hate the peasant revolution. This position is of course contrary to ours. Then, the better the writing skills of the script, and the better the performance art of the actors, the greater the bad effect on the point of view. Recently, the Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe performed "Ningwuguan" when it was founded, and the audience had opinions after watching it. I heard that Mr. Liu Yiping, a famous Qinqiang actor here, also has this masterpiece, and he has now voluntarily proposed never to perform "Ningwuguan" again. This is a very good manifestation of Mr. Liu Yiping's improving political consciousness, and it is worthy of our learning.
    I also have a "Ci Hu" from "Tie Guan Tu." Senior veteran artists have taught me a lot of exquisite performances, and I myself have put a lot of effort into studying it. In the past, my performance of this play was very popular at home and abroad, and it was one of my repertoire programs. However, after liberation, due to realizing the reasons mentioned above, I voluntarily stopped performing "Ci Hu." After the repertoire was opened, some people thought that there were many beautiful dances and singing in it, and asked me to perform it again for everyone to see. I once had this plan, but after careful consideration, I always felt that it was not good for the audience, so it was better not to perform it.
    Other plays such as "Iron Rooster" also belong to things with reactionary political views. It negates the national revolution and goes against the wishes of the people, so we cannot perform it well.
    In addition, although plays such as "Killing the Son to Report," "Double Nail Record," and "Ma Si Yuan" also reflect some aspects of the society at that time, what can be seen besides bringing back the impression of pornography and horror to the audience when they are brought to the stage today? "Ma Si Yuan" is one of Mr. Yu Lianquan (Xiao Cuihua)'s masterpieces. He performed a few performances in Beijing, and the audience's response was also not good. Recently, Mr. Yu Lianquan has written an article expressing his attitude, resolutely no longer performing this play. He has decades of experience in performing this play, and his performance skills also have unique features. Today, the people do not like this play, so he resolutely stopped performing it. This is also a manifestation of the old artists' courage to correct their mistakes.
    According to the report of the Second National Repertoire Conference, we know that more than 50,000 traditional repertoires have been excavated in various opera types across the country. We have such a rich and colorful heritage. Can't we choose good repertoires from here to perform? Why should we waste our valuable time on bad plays that cannot be changed? I believe that there are many good scripts waiting for us to sort out and perform, and the audience is also looking forward to seeing more good plays. We should seize the time to sort out some good plays to meet the audience.
    We should also pay attention to the fact that in the traditional repertoire, there are many cases where fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds coexist, and fragrant flowers are often hidden behind poisonous weeds. As long as the poisonous weeds are removed, the fragrant flowers will naturally be revealed. Take "Guifei Intoxicated" as an example, which I often perform. This is a play with strong dance elements. The senior veteran artists have left us many beautiful performances. However, some of them are yellow, such as the flirtation with the two eunuchs, with some suggestive actions and expressions, and there are also some bad things in the lines. I have changed all the yellow things, and the theme has changed. The entire performance style has also changed accordingly. The image of a lonely and depressed court woman is naturally highlighted on the stage.
    In sorting out and adapting, I think the most important thing is the close cooperation between literary and art workers and our opera actors. I have several old friends in the literary and art circles who have worked with me for many years. They often listen to the plays in the front row as audience members. If they see any problems, they immediately give me their opinions. Sometimes, I myself will find some problems and study them with them. Generally speaking, we use the method of mutual enlightenment, and it has been effective for many years. I don't like to drastically change an old play that has been circulating for a long time and is already familiar to the audience all at once, so that the audience doesn't think it's that play. The audience is not easy to accept this. I adopt a gradual modification method. When many modifications have been accumulated, it is actually very different from the old appearance of the year, but the audience has gradually become accustomed to it in my gradual modification process. Why do I do this? Because it is not an easy task to change and perform a play well. From my experience, I will see new problems after changing for a period of time, and sometimes I even have to change it back according to the audience's opinions. In short, this work requires a very meticulous, very patient, and step-by-step approach.
    What I said above about not performing bad plays is completely different from inappropriate restrictive rules and regulations. We still have to oppose those restrictive rules and regulations. In the past, we suffered from it, especially the performance, sorting out, adaptation, and excavation of traditional programs were greatly restricted. For example, it is necessary to measure the repertoire and focus on analyzing its popular nature, but simplifying this issue and understanding it very narrowly, believing that as long as it is the ruling class, there will be no good people. We call this simple and narrow statement "the theory of sole composition," which is not the correct attitude towards traditional repertoire. Bao Gong in "Qin Xianglian" and Kuang Zhong in "Fifteen Strings of Cash" are all characters loved by the people. If it is said that they are all serving the ruling class, and affirming them means affirming the ruling class, according to this statement, "Fifteen Strings of Cash" will become an anti-people play.
    Some people also think that if there are two wives in the script, it violates today's new marriage law and cannot be performed. In fact, polygamy is an objective fact that existed in Chinese feudal society, reflecting an unreasonable phenomenon of the feudal social system, so it is also natural to appear on the stage. Today, we must first look at what the story and theme performed on the stage are. It is not good to focus on promoting chastity. The theme of "Three Mothers Teaching the Son" is teaching the son. Why can't it be sung? It is certainly not good to beautify and promote polygamy. The theme of "Second Hall Abandoning the Son" does not involve the issue of polygamy, and it also writes about a kind stepmother. What is wrong with this? If we only deny these plays with the crime of "promoting polygamy," I don't think it is appropriate.
    A few years ago, many new literary and art workers who participated in opera work did not understand the traditional repertoire well. They often used frameworks to套concrete works, and if they couldn't套them, they would kill and chop them without carefully analyzing their specific content, which easily led to harmful restrictive rules and regulations. For example, someone said: "All plays with ghosts are bad," and someone else said: "Gods and Buddhas can appear on stage, why can't ghosts appear?" These two statements form a confrontation. In fact, it also depends on the specific content of the script, and it cannot be generalized. Some plays have appeared many ghosts on the stage, just like opening a ghost exhibition, which only gives people a gloomy impression of terror, and has nothing to do with the plot, such as "Huang Shi Nu Visiting Yin" and "Tang Wang Visiting Hell," etc., which give people this feeling. Of course, we must resolutely oppose this kind of ghost play. But there are also some plays in which the ghosts that appear contain a positive meaning. For example, Jiao Guiying in "Love Exploration" and Li Huiniang in "Red Plum Pavilion," etc., all express the people's will to struggle through the author's fantasy. As long as the image of terror is removed, what is wrong with performing them?
    We sincerely welcome new literary and art workers to participate in opera work, because they have rich political theoretical knowledge, can grasp the policy principles, and are of great help to us. At the same time, we also hope that new literary and art workers will quickly master and be familiar with the characteristics of Chinese traditional opera art, and conduct specific analysis of specific works, and correctly understand the ideological significance of traditional repertoire. On the other hand, we actors should also cooperate closely with the new literary and art workers. We are more familiar with the repertoire and performance art, but we lack the ability of ideological criticism. We should tell the new literary and art workers what we are familiar with, so that we can get their help and become an overall force. Because sometimes the value and significance of traditional repertoire is not only reflected in its literary aspects, but also in the performance art it preserves. Just like when I watched Qin opera in Lanzhou a few days ago, Mr. Liu Jinrong performed Yang Jiye in "Dian Jiang." There was not a single line of singing, and I couldn't hear any recitation. He relied entirely on a few dance movements and facial expressions to express the old Linggong's feelings of defending the motherland and caring for his son. This kind of extremely valuable performance art cannot be seen from the script. Therefore, the cooperation between artists and new literary and art workers is very necessary. In short, when we sort out the traditional repertoire, we must look at the problem comprehensively, not unilaterally, objectively, not subjectively. This is the key to breaking "restrictive rules and regulations" and the key to doing a good job in exploring traditional repertoire.
    Below, I would like to talk about some issues that our opera circles should pay attention to in the anti-rightist struggle.
    Rightist elements are instigating fires everywhere, recruiting troops and buying horses, and attempting to oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose socialism. Our opera circles are also one of their important targets of attack. Comrades, most of us came from the old society. We have seen the suffering of the old society with our own eyes, and we have experienced it ourselves, so I don't need to elaborate. Since the leadership of the Communist Party, our artists have been truly liberated, and opera art has been vigorously developed. Is it not an unprecedented miracle that more than 300 types of operas have flourished since liberation? Is it not the result of the Party's leadership that more than 200,000 opera troupes have emerged since liberation, and talents have emerged in large numbers? As actors, we have not only traveled all over the country, but also performed abroad as cultural envoys of the country, and have been warmly welcomed by the vast number of people at home and abroad. Is it not an achievement obtained under the close care of the Party and the government? I am more than 60 years old this year, and I can still work happily on the stage, and I feel younger. Is this not given by the leadership of the Party? The rightist elements妄想to negate the achievements of the Party in leading opera work is really opening their eyes and talking nonsense.
    Regarding the fallacy of "laymen cannot lead experts" clamored by the rightist elements, let's first study what is an expert. In the past, in the opera circles, the so-called "expert" referred to actors. As long as they can sing opera, they are "experts." However, it is different now. What we want to build is socialist literature and art, which contains political significance. In this regard, we actors have become laymen, which requires someone to lead us to study. If we study well, we can also become experts. In the field of opera art, some leading comrades used to be laymen. After more than eight years of study, they have mastered a lot of professional knowledge. Can't they become experts? The rightist elements use this kind of talk to挑拨us. We must expose their conspiracies and tricks, and under the leadership of the Party, unite closely with the new literary and art workers and do a good job in opera.
    Since liberation, the comrades in our opera circles have been educated by the Party, and their political awareness has been improved to varying degrees. However, although they have experienced several political movements and received some training, they have not directly深入into the heated struggle. Therefore, the old ideas have not been well transformed, and some people still feel unaccustomed to the new society, the new system, and the new life, and even have resistance. When the rightist elements attacked the Party, some people wavered, or even were pulled into the water and fell into the mud pit. This is a painful lesson. The facts before us have sounded the alarm. Through this lesson, we realize the urgent need for ideological transformation. Since we are called "engineers of the human soul," we must first shape our own souls more beautifully and more purely. Therefore, the ideological transformation of our opera circles is imminent, and the anti-rightist struggle is a training opportunity to transform our thinking. Don't let it go easily.
    Only when we transform our thinking well and stand firm can we truly serve the socialist construction of the motherland through opera art!

    谈谈不演坏戏和反右派斗争问题
    梅兰芳
    甘肃是秦腔发源地之一，有着很多秦腔老艺人和丰富的戏曲宝藏。现在，又正在建成祖国的工业基地，一切都在飞跃发展。我们到这里来演戏，可以学习到很多东西。在解放以前，由于交通不便，我连到兰州来的梦都没有做过；根据那时候的运输情况，远地的剧团是很难到此地来演出的。只有在共产党领导下的今天，工人同志用劳动为我们铺平道路，我们才能来到兰州，和这儿的劳动人民见面，向大家学习一些东西。这样的幸福，是共产党带给我们的，我们应该感谢中国共产党。
    这次到兰州来，正赶上甘肃省戏曲界的同志们举行的座谈会。作为一个戏曲演员，谈一谈对戏曲艺术上的一些看法，是我们应该做的事情。但是我很抱歉，正在演出期间，没有时间很好的准备，有说得不对的地方，希望同志们给我指教。
    我想，先谈一谈开放剧目和不演坏戏的问题。我知道大家对这个问题都很关心，可能有人这样想法：政府已经明令开放禁戏，就是说什么戏都可以上演了，为什么又提出不要演坏戏呢？还有，什么样的戏算是好戏，什么样的戏算是坏戏，它们的区别又在哪里？大家都想弄清楚这些问题。下面谈一谈我个人的意见。
    文化部根据“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，宣布对所有的传统剧目一律开放，这个决定解决了演出剧目贫乏的问题，让很多老戏重新和观众见了面，一些传统的、优秀的剧本、舞蹈、腔调和曲牌，也都出现在舞台上，受到观众的欢迎。因此，演员的生活和工作，也都随着有了改进，这对戏曲艺术的发展与繁荣，起了很大的推动作用。但是，政府开放剧目的目的，并不是鼓励大家演坏戏，更不是让我们开倒车，而是为了更好地发扬我们戏曲艺术中的优良传统。政府不用行政命令来取缔坏戏，也不等于艺术上就没有好坏的标准了，而是由于我们演员政治思想上有了提高，党和政府信任我们，把上演剧目的决定权交给我们。那么我们就应该为演出的效果着想。演一出戏，要看看它在观众中起一个什么样的作用。人民把今天的演员，称做是“人类灵魂的工程师”，这个头衔是何等光荣，给我们的任务是何等重大，我们在整理传统剧目的时候，怎么能够不加以选择呢？我们提倡的是富有思想性、艺术性的好剧目。我们坚决反对上演那些内容和表演上没有什么价值，甚至于对人民身心健康有害的坏剧目。所以说政府开放剧目，和我们提出不演坏戏是不矛盾的。开放剧目，是为了发扬戏曲艺术的优良传统，而不演坏戏，正是为了使鲜花更快更多地出现在舞台上。
    我们一方面应该坚持大胆放手挖掘剧目的方针；另一方面，又必须认真负责的对待上演剧目。哪些剧目可以原封不动地搬上舞台，哪些剧目必须适当地加以修改，哪些剧目没有修改的价值，这都需要经过认真的研究和讨论。
    具有反动政治观点的东西，和丑恶、淫秽、恐怖、对人民身心健康有害的东西，而这些毒素在剧本中又占了主要地位，去掉以后就没有戏了。像这类剧目，我觉得大可不必浪费时间去整理它。比如，昆曲传奇“铁冠图”里有些常演的戏，从剧本上看，有它的写作技巧，表演上也有些独特的艺术技巧。但是，作者的立场，却是反对农民起义，仇视农民革命的。这种立场当然和我们相反，那么，剧本的写作技巧愈好，演员的表演艺术愈好，对观点起的坏作用也就愈大。最近北方昆曲剧院在建院的时候，演过一次“宁武关”，观众看了，就有意见。听说，这里的秦腔名演员刘易平先生也有这出拿手好戏，现在已经自动提出，永远不演“宁武关”了。这是刘易平先生提高政治觉悟的一个很好的表现，值得我们学习。
    我也有一出“铁冠图”里的“刺虎”，前辈老艺人传授给我不少精湛的表演，我自己对它也下过很大的工夫来钻研。过去，我演这出戏在国内外都很受欢迎，是我的保留节目之一。但是，解放后由于认识到上面所说的原因，我自动把“刺虎”停演了。开放剧目以后，有些人认为这里面有很多优美的舞蹈和唱腔，要求我再演给大家看看，我一度也有这个打算，后来经过仔细的考虑，总觉得对观众没有好处，还是不演为妙。
    其他像“铁公鸡”这出戏，也是属于有反动政治观点的东西。它否定了民族革命，和人民的意愿相违背，我们就无法把它演好。
    另外，像“杀子报”、“双钉记”、“马思远”一类的戏，虽然也反映了当时社会上的一些面貌，但是拿到今天的舞台上来，除了给观众带回去的是色情和恐怖的印象以外，还有什么东西可看呢？“马思远”是于连泉（小翠花）先生拿手戏之一。他在北京演出了几场，观众的反映也是不好。最近于连泉先生已经写文章表示态度，坚决不再上演这出戏了。他演这出戏有几十年的经验，表演技巧上也有独到之处，今天，人民不喜欢这出戏，他就毅然停演，这也是老艺人勇于改过的表现。
    根据第二次全国剧目会议的报告，我们知道全国各剧种已经挖掘出五万多个传统剧目。我们拥有这样一笔丰富多彩的遗产，难道说就不能从这里面选出好的剧目来上演吗？为什么我们要把宝贵的时间浪费在改不好的坏戏上呢？我相信有很多好剧本在等待着我们整理、上演，观众也在盼望着看到更多的好戏，我们应该抓紧时间，整理一些好戏出来同观众见面。
    我们还应该注意，在传统剧目中，有很多是香花毒草并存的，而且香花常常是隐藏在毒草后面，只要把毒草部分去掉，香花自然就显露出来了。就拿我常演的“贵妃醉酒”做个例子。这是一出舞蹈性很强的戏，前辈老艺人给我们留下了很多优美的表演，可是，其中有一部分是黄色的东西，如和两个太监调笑当中，有一些暗示性的动作和表情，台词里面也有些不好的地方。我改掉了所有黄色的东西，主题就有了变化，全部的表演风格，也随着起了变化，一个孤寂、抑郁的宫庭妇女的形象，自然就突出在舞台上了。
    在整理和改编中，我觉得最重要的是文艺工作者和我们戏曲演员的紧密合作。我有几位文艺界的老朋友，同我合作了好多年。他们经常作为观众，在前台听戏，看出了什么问题，就马上给我提意见。有的时候，我自己也会发现一些问题，和他们一起研究。总的说来我们用的是互相启发的方法，多少年来是收到效果的。我改戏不喜欢把一个流传很久而观众已经熟悉的老戏，一下子就大刀阔斧地改得面目全非，叫观众看了不像那出戏。这样做，观众是不容易接受的。我采取逐步修改的方法。等到积累了许多次的修改，实际上已经跟当年的老样子大不相同了，可是观众在我逐步修改的过程中，逐步地也就看惯了。我为什么这样做呢？因为一出戏把它改好演好，不是一桩容易的事。拿我的经验来讲，改一个时期，又会看出新的问题，有时甚至于还要根据观众的意见，再改回来。总之，这件工作是需要很细致、很耐心，步步深入的。
    上面我所说的不演坏戏，和不适当的清规戒律是截然不同的。我们还是要反对那些清规戒律的。过去，我们吃了它的亏，特别是使传统节目的上演、整理、改编和挖掘工作，都受到了很大的限制。比如说，衡量剧目，着重分析它的人民性，这是必要的，但是把这一问题简单化了，理解得很狭隘，认为只要是统治阶级，就不会有好人。像这种简单而狭隘的说法，我们把他叫做“唯成分论”，就不是正确地对待传统剧目的态度。“秦香莲”里的包公，“十五贯”里的况钟，都是人民喜爱的人物。如果说他们都是为统治阶级服务，肯定他们，就是肯定了统治阶级，要按这种说法“十五贯”就会变成反人民的戏了。
    还有人看到剧本里有两个老婆，就认为违反今天的新婚姻法，不能上演。其实，多妻问题是中国封建社会存在的一种客观事实，反映了封建社会制度的一个不合理的现象，因此在舞台上出现，也是很自然的事情。今天，我们首先要看舞台上表演的故事、主题是什么？着重宣传守节是不好的，像“三娘教子”的主题是教子，为什么不可以唱呢？美化和鼓吹多妻制当然不好，像“二堂舍子”的主题并不涉及多妻问题，而且还写出了一个善良后母的形象，这又有什么不可以呢？如果仅仅拿“宣传多妻制”的罪名，否定这些戏，我觉得是不妥当的。
    前几年，有很多位参加戏曲工作的新文艺工作者，对传统剧目不够了解。常常用框框去套具体的作品，套不上就大杀大砍，不仔细地去分析它的具体内容，这样做，就容易产生有害的清规戒律。比方有人说：“凡是有鬼的戏都不好”，又有人说：“神佛可以登场，鬼魂为何不能出台？”这两种说法，形成对立。其实也要看剧本的具体内容，不能一概而论。有些戏，在舞台上出现了许许多多的鬼，就像开了个鬼的展览会，只会给人一种阴森森的恐怖印象，和剧情并没有多大关系，如“黄氏女游阴”、“唐王游地狱”等戏，就给人有这样的感觉。这种鬼戏，当然我们要坚决反对。可是也有些戏里出现的鬼，含有一种积极意义。像“情探”的敫桂英，“红梅阁”里的李慧娘等等，这都是通过作者的幻想来表达人民斗争的意志，只要去掉恐怖的形象，又有什么不可以演的呢？
    我们诚恳地欢迎新文艺工作者参加戏曲工作，因为他们有丰富的政治理论知识，能够掌握政策原则，对我们帮助很大。同时也希望新文艺工作者很快地掌握和熟悉中国传统戏曲艺术的特点，对于具体作品进行具体分析，正确地理解传统剧目的思想意义。另一方面，我们做演员的，也应该很好地和新文艺工作者密切合作。我们对剧目和表演艺术是比较熟悉的，但缺少思想批判能力，应该把我们所熟悉的，告诉新文艺工作者，才能得到他们的帮助，成为一个整体的力量。因为有时传统剧目的价值和意义，不仅表现在它的文学方面，也表现在它保存的表演艺术方面，就像前些日子在兰州观摩秦剧时，刘金荣老先生表演了“点将”里的杨继业，一句唱词也没有，也听不到念白，全靠几个舞蹈动作和面部表情，表达出老令公保卫祖国、关怀爱子的心情，像这种极有价值的表演艺术，从剧本上是看不出来的。所以说，艺人和新文艺工作者的合作，是非常必要的。总之我们在整理传统剧目的时候，看问题要全面，不要片面，要客观，不要主观。这是打破“清规戒律”的关键，也是做好挖掘传统剧目工作的关键。
    下面，我想谈一谈在反右派斗争中，我们戏曲界应该注意的一些问题。
    右派分子到处煽动放火，招兵买马，企图反对党的领导，反对社会主义，我们戏曲界也是他们进攻的重要目标之一。同志们：我们多半是从旧社会过来的。旧社会的痛苦，我们亲眼见过，也亲身经历过，用不着我来细说。自从有了共产党的领导，我们艺人才得到真正的解放，戏曲艺术才得到了蓬勃的发展。难道说解放后三百多种戏曲，百花齐放，不是亘古没有的奇迹吗？难道说解放后涌现了二十几万戏曲队伍，人才辈出，不是党领导的效果吗？我们以演员身份，不但走遍全国，而且作为国家的文化使节，出国演出，受到国内外广大人民的热烈欢迎，难道说这不是在党和政府的亲切关怀下得到的成就吗？我今年六十多岁了，现在还能在舞台上愉快地工作着，而且感到更年轻了，这难道不是党的领导所给予的吗？右派分子妄想否定党领导戏曲工作的成就，真是睁着眼说瞎话。
    关于右派分子叫嚣的“外行不能领导内行”的谬论，我们先来研究一下，什么是内行？过去在戏曲界所谓“内行”是指演员而言。只要会唱戏，就是“内行”。可是，现在不同了。我们要建设的是社会主义的文学艺术，这里面包含着政治上的意义。在这一方面，我们演员就变成外行了，这就需要有人来领导我们学习，学习得好，也可以变成内行。在戏曲艺术方面，有些领导同志过去是外行，他们经过八年多的学习，已经掌握了许多业务上的知识，难道说他们不能成为内行吗？右派分子拿这种话来挑拨我们，我们必须戳穿他们的阴谋诡计，在党的领导下，和新文艺工作者亲密团结，做好戏曲工作。
    我们戏曲界的同志，自从解放以来，受到党的教育，在政治觉悟上，各有不同程度的提高。不过，虽然经历过历次政治运动，受到一些锻炼，却没有更直接的深入到火热的斗争中去，因此，旧思想还没有很好改造，对于新社会的新制度，新生活，还有人感到不习惯，甚至存在有抵触情绪。在右派分子向党进攻的时候，有人就摇摆不定，甚至被拉下水去，掉进泥坑，这是一次惨痛的教训。面前的事实，给我们敲起了警钟。我们通过这次教训，使我们认识到思想改造的迫切需要。我们既然被称为
  “人类灵魂的工程师”，首先就要把自己的灵魂塑造得更美好，更纯洁。所以，我们戏曲界的思想改造，是刻不容缓的，而反右派斗争，正是改造思想的一个锻炼机会，不要轻轻放过。
    我们只有把思想改造好，立场站的稳，才能真正通过戏曲艺术为祖国社会主义建设服务！
