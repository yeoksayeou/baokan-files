Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th. As the anti-Rightist struggle gradually deepens, the political awareness and discernment ability of the vast number of cadres and masses in Hebei Province have generally improved, and many Rightists and Rightist small cliques have been successively exposed.

At present, the anti-Rightist struggle in Hebei Province has expanded from party and government leading organs, democratic parties, and industrial and commercial circles to all walks of life such as literary and art circles, journalistic circles, and scientific and technological circles. The Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles (文联) recently exposed an anti-Party group headed by Liu Yiting, Deputy Director and Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. They used the editorial department of the "Bee" magazine, the organ of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, as their position, and launched vicious attacks against the Party in a planned and organized manner, opposing the Party's leadership over literature and art. The Cotton and Hemp Department and the Native Products Bureau of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the method of joint reasoning and struggle to expose the anti-Communist and anti-socialist Rightist alliance headed by Li Zhonglin, Che Maoshu, Zhang Deshen, and Cao Zengshun. They engaged in secret activities at the beginning of the rectification movement, formulated anti-Communist plans, and even clamored that they would kill the Communist Party one day. They also openly incited the masses to "oust" the Communist Party leading cadres of the Cotton and Hemp Department and seize the leadership of this unit. Shijiazhuang City exposed a Rightist group headed by Chu Zhuang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shijiazhuang City of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Liu Mufeng, a teacher at the Shijiazhuang Teachers' Continuing Education College, and Hua Zhi, a teacher at the Accelerated Middle School. They incited the masses in schools to propose "abolishing the Party committee system" and slandered the Communist Party, saying, "The Party is a sectarian clique. To overcome sectarianism, the Party must be abolished." They also colluded with Zhu Hong, the editor of the "Huajian" weekly in Shijiazhuang City and a Rightist element, to plot the creation of a "Speaking Out" publication as a weapon to incite the masses to attack the Communist Party.

The vast number of peasants in Hebei Province have also written letters to relevant leading organs to expose the anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies of the Rightists. The peasants of Xishang Jialin Village, Luan County, the hometown of Miao Juntong, a Rightist element in the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Materials Supply, wrote to expose that Miao Juntong was a major traitor during the War of Resistance Against Japan who helped Japanese imperialism brutally massacre the masses. This year, when Miao Juntong returned home, he not only obstructed his family members from joining the agricultural cooperative, but also incited five cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative, sabotaging the agricultural collectivization movement. More than 30 peasants in Honghe Village, Xinxijiang Township, Qinghe County, wrote to expose the crimes of Ren Tianfang, a Rightist element in the Hebei Provincial Timber Company, in reversing the verdicts against the peasants. Li Guochun's mother, a Party member and Rightist element of the Hebei Provincial Cultural Bureau, traveled more than 200 miles from her hometown to reason with Li Guochun, refuting Li Guochun's anti-Communist fallacies.

With the deepening of the anti-Rightist struggle, the middle-of-the-roaders have been effectively educated. On the one hand, they examined their own erroneous words and deeds, drew a clear ideological line with the Rightists, and on the other hand, actively joined the anti-Rightist struggle. In the process of criticizing the Rightist Song Tianxiang by the Shijiazhuang Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, some social figures who had been confused realized that Song Tianxiang was an ugly political careerist who conspired to overthrow the leadership of the working class and restore the capitalist system, and then actively exposed Song Tianxiang's reactionary words and deeds. Song Tianxiang had slandered the Communist Party as the "three major evils" and brought "disasters" to the people of the whole country; and said that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang would become the "ruling party" in the future, which meant that the Communist Party should step down. In the struggle to expose Zhu Qianwu, the "military advisor" of the Rightists in Tangshan's industrial and commercial circles, Feng Shaoxiang, Dong Ruisheng, Wang Ziming and others, who were considered "confidants" by Zhu Qianwu, after being educated, realized Zhu Qianwu's hideous face of anti-socialism, expressed their willingness to stand on the socialist stand to fight against Zhu Qianwu, and exposed Zhu Qianwu's crimes of inciting industrialists and businessmen to resist socialist transformation and other anti-Soviet and anti-Communist words and deeds.

    河北省反右派斗争扩展到各行各业
    中间人士同右派划清思想界限积极投入斗争
    新华社保定7日电　随着反右派斗争的逐步深入，河北省广大干部和群众的政治觉悟和辨别能力普遍有了提高，许多右派分子和右派小集团被陆续揭露出来。
    目前，河北省反右派斗争已从党政领导机关、民主党派和工商界扩展到文艺界、新闻界、科学技术界等各行各业。河北省文联最近揭露出以省文联副主任、党组副书记刘艺亭为首的反党集团。他们以省文联机关刊物——“蜜蜂”编辑部作为阵地，有组织有计划地向党进行恶毒的攻击，反对党对文学艺术的领导。河北省供销社棉麻处和土产局采取联合说理斗争的办法，揭露出以李钟麟、车懋树、张德身、曹增顺等为首的反共反社会主义右派联盟。他们在整风运动开始时就进行秘密活动，制订反共计划，并且扬言总有一天要杀共产党。他们还公开煽动群众把棉麻处的共产党员领导干部“赶下台”，夺取了这个单位的领导权。石家庄市揭露出一个以民主促进会石家庄市筹备委员会副主任楚庄、石家庄教师进修学院教师柳木风、速成中学教员华直等为首的右派集团，他们在学校中到处煽动群众提出“取消党委制”，并诬蔑共产党说：“党就是宗派，要想克服宗派就得取消党。”他们还勾结石家庄市“花间”周刊编辑、右派分子朱虹，图谋创办“鸣放”刊物，作为煽动群众向共产党进攻的武器。
    河北省广大农民群众也纷纷写信给有关领导机关揭露右派分子反共反社会主义的阴谋活动。河北省物资供应局右派分子苗钧韬的家乡——滦县西商家林村的农民，来信揭露苗钧韬在抗日战争时期是个帮助日本帝国主义惨杀群众的大汉奸，今年苗钧韬回家时，不但阻挠他的家属参加农业合作社，并且煽动五户社员退社，破坏农业合作化运动。清河县辛集乡洪河村三十多个农民来信揭露河北省木材公司右派分子任天放向农民反攻倒算的罪恶行为。河北省文化局党内右派分子李国春的母亲从二百多里路远的乡下赶来同李国春讲理，驳斥李国春的反共谬论。
    随着反右派斗争的深入开展，有力地教育了中间人士，他们一面检查自己的错误言行，同右派分子划清思想界限，一面积极投入反右派斗争。民革石家庄市筹备委员会在批判右派分子宋天祥的过程中，一些曾受过迷惑的社会人士，在认识到宋天祥是个阴谋推翻工人阶级领导、使资本主义制度复辟的政治野心家的丑恶面目以后，就积极起来揭露宋天祥的反动言行。宋天祥曾诬蔑共产党是“三大害”，给全国人民带来了“灾害”；并且说，民革将来会变成“执政党”，这就是说要共产党下台。唐山市工商界在揭露右派分子的“军师”朱乾五的斗争中，被朱乾五认为“亲信”的冯绍祥、董瑞生、王子明等人经过教育，认识到朱乾五反社会主义的狰狞面目，表示要站在社会主义立场上同朱乾五进行斗争，并揭露出朱乾五煽动工商业者抗拒社会主义改造及其它一些反苏反共的罪恶言行。
