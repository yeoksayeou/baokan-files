Xinhua News Agency News: Commercial departments in Hubei Province are making preparations to welcome the arrival of the peak market season.

Hubei Province has had a bumper harvest this year. According to surveys and analysis by relevant departments, the province's purchasing power in the fourth quarter of this year will increase by nearly 6% compared to the same period last year, and the peak season market will be more prosperous than in previous years. According to the supply plan of state-owned commercial departments, the supply of sanitary shirts, sanitary pants, bamboo shell thermos bottles, rubber shoes, towels and other items that have been popular in rural areas for many years will be greater in the fourth quarter than in the same period last year, and these commodities will be given priority to rural areas.

The inventory of the province's supply and marketing cooperative system is currently one-fifth higher than in the same period last year, equal to the highest inventory in the second half of last year. The supply and marketing cooperatives have also purchased coarse and fine porcelain such as jars, plates, pots, and bowls from Hunan, Jiangxi and other places, and entrusted local handicraft cooperatives to process iron pots, chopsticks, lamps, etc., to meet the needs of rural areas.

The means of production needed in various places during the autumn plowing and winter sowing seasons are being continuously transported to rural areas. This year, in order to help agricultural cooperatives save expenses, the supply and marketing cooperatives have decided to focus on repair and maintenance and supplement with supply in terms of means of production. Special attention is paid to teaching farmers the technology of using and repairing double-wheeled double-shared plows so that the agricultural cooperatives' existing new-style farm tools can be fully utilized. In the past month, the provincial supply and marketing cooperative has also organized a batch of water pumps, waterwheels, and well-drilling tools to supply to farmers to support drought resistance in rural areas.

    湖北旺季市场将比往年更繁荣
    新华社讯　湖北省商业部门正在做好准备工作，迎接市场旺季的到来。
    湖北省今年农业丰收，据有关部门调查分析，今年第四季度全省购买力将比去年同期增长近6％，旺季市场将比往年更为繁荣。根据国营商业部门的供应计划，历年来畅销于农村的卫生衣、卫生裤、竹壳热水瓶、胶鞋、毛巾等用品，第四季度的供应量都比去年同期要多，这些商品并且将优先供应农村。
    全省供销合作系统的库存量目前也比去年同期多五分之一，同去年下半年最高库存量相等。供销社还从湖南、江西等地采购了坛、盘、罐、碗等粗细瓷器，委托当地手工业社加工铁锅、筷子、灯具等，满足农村的需要。
    各地在秋耕冬播时节需要的生产资料，正在源源运往农村。今年供销社为了帮助农业社节省开支，在生产资料方面决定以修配为主，供应为辅，特别注意向农民传授使用和修配双轮双铧犁的技术，使农业社现有的新式农具能够充分利用起来。近一个月来，省供销社还组织一批抽水机、水车和打井工具供应农民，支援农村抗旱。
