The Ceylon Government Trade Delegation jointly led by Senator V. N. Wikramanayake, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance of Ceylon, and Representative M. S. Subasinghe, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and External Affairs of Ceylon, and the Government Trade Delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, have concluded their discussions in Beijing on trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.

As a result of these discussions, the two governments signed a five-year Trade and Payments Agreement on September 19, 1957. The signatories were Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade on the Chinese side, and Wilmot A. Perera, Ceylon's Ambassador to China, on the Ceylon side. This agreement will come into effect after the current trade agreement between the two countries expires at the end of 1957. The new agreement stipulates the exchange of rubber, rice and other commodities. Under this agreement, the two governments also signed a protocol on the exchange of goods for 1958.

In accordance with the Bandung Conference's resolutions on economic cooperation and mutual assistance and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the two governments also signed an economic aid agreement. The agreement stipulates that the Government of the People's Republic of China will provide economic assistance of 75 million Ceylon rupees to Ceylon's rubber replanting program over a period of five years.

The negotiations in Beijing were conducted in a cordial and friendly spirit. The two governments believe that the agreements signed in Beijing will further expand trade between the two countries, strengthen economic cooperation, and enhance the friendship between China and Ceylon.
