The Struggle of Life and Death, A Severe Test
Zhu Yunshan, Central Standing Committee Member and Director of the Organization Department of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

　　The existence of leftists, centrists, and rightists within the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), and the struggle between two lines, did not begin today. It can be said that this struggle has existed since the first day the RCCK was established. In order to clearly distinguish between right and wrong, I would like to discuss the fundamental differences between the two lines within the RCCK from the perspective of the RCCK's organizational work.

　　First, on the issue of the distinction between the enemy and ourselves, the 1949 Democratic Parties Conference determined that the RCCK should still be called the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang of China. This means that we inherit and promote Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous progress, and at the same time, we should draw a clear line between ourselves and the reactionary Kuomintang. However, the rightists only saw the first five characters "中国国民党" (Chinese Kuomintang), but not the last five characters "革命委员会" (Revolutionary Committee). They racked their brains to try to revive the reactionary Kuomintang of "the Jiang family's world and the Chen family's party" in the RCCK. In 1949, we and the entire Chinese people were joyfully celebrating liberation, but some rightists wept bitterly, feeling the "pain of the party's demise." In 1951, when the "Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries" movement was launched on a large scale throughout the country, all of our members actively participated in this movement. However, the rightists always felt a deep pain about this movement, and some even interceded for the arrested counter-revolutionaries, or complained about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The rightists adopted a negative attitude towards all national political movements, especially the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movement, emphasizing deviations, negating achievements, and opposing mass Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements. There are too many such examples to list.

　　In terms of organizational line, the RCCK adheres to the principle of "equal emphasis on quality and quantity" and "combining consolidation and development." This principle was, is, and will continue to be correct. However, the rightists oppose this principle, blindly pursuing quantity, regardless of quality, emphasizing development, and opposing consolidation. They falsely accuse the correct line of being "closed-doorism" and curse comrades who adhere to the correct line as "vicious dogs guarding the door."

　　The RCCK should establish organizational structures mainly in large and medium-sized cities, and recruit members mainly from the upper and middle classes. Moreover, the political background of recruited members must be clear, and it is better to have fewer than to have unqualified members. This is in line with the needs of the united front and the provisions of the party constitution. However, the rightists act differently. They advocate planting willows everywhere and blooming everywhere, regardless of region, political conditions, or good or bad elements. As long as they are former Kuomintang members, they are all brought into the RCCK. They do not require joining procedures or historical review, forming a "return of the old Kuomintang." The reason why the rightists in the RCCK so actively oppose the correct organizational principles and organizational line is to achieve their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist political conspiracies. They vainly attempt to extend their claws to every corner of the country, so they try to rope in all those who have been struggled against, disgruntled elements, backward elements, and even those who have just been released from prison into the RCCK. Moreover, once they join the RCCK, they often make unreasonable demands and deliberately disrupt the RCCK organization. They also put forward the so-called slogan of "the Yangtze River and the Yellow River carry sediment downstream together," thinking that this would form a numerous and powerful "second major party," so as to compete with the Communist Party for short-term gains. Once the situation changes and the opportunity matures, feudal landlords, bureaucratic warlords, politicians, and all bourgeois elements can rise up to seize the paradise they have lost and trample the liberated people under their feet again.

　　Since liberation eight years ago, the rightists within the RCCK have always been looking for every opportunity to try to tamper with the political direction and organizational line of the RCCK, to pull the RCCK out of the socialist path. Because the comrades within the RCCK who adhere to the correct line closely rely on the leadership of the Party and unite and win over the middle elements, the implementation of the RCCK's political line and organizational line has basically not been distorted or undermined. However, in certain places, certain departments, and certain links, the rightist line has had a profound negative impact for a certain period of time, and even gained the upper hand. The organization has suffered certain harm, and the situation is extremely serious. Taking the Preparatory Committee of the Tilanqiao District in Shanghai as an example, the person in charge of this district's preparatory committee, Yu Ruonan, was a backbone member of Chen Mingshu, a rightist element. He said that the RCCK has a development target of 10 million to 15 million people, and if it develops 100,000 people, it will have the strength to compete with the United Front Department for People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members. In order to achieve his goal of "large-scale development," Yu Ruonan openly declared: It doesn't matter if counter-revolutionaries are recruited. Therefore, from May last year to May this year, the number of people increased from four to fifty-six, and he personally introduced thirty-three people to join the RCCK. In fact, similar serious and bad situations are not limited to Shanghai, nor are they limited to the Preparatory Committee of the Tilanqiao District.

　　In recent years, although the correct line and the rightist line within the RCCK have been constantly fighting, because the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production had not yet been completed at that time, many internal contradictions had not yet been fully revealed. The comrades put unity first, hoping that the rightists would accept the help of the organization and gradually change their reactionary stance under the education of the Party and the people. Therefore, the struggle was mostly carried out on local issues and on a smaller scale. Facts have proved that without a common foundation, it is impossible to achieve true unity. What we are arguing with the rightists about is the major issue of whether or not we want the leadership of the Communist Party and whether or not we want socialism. These are all issues related to the life and death of our country, and related to whether the fate of our nation will return to the old path of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. In other words, they are all major political issues that need to be addressed in a big article, not a small one, and even more so not to be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary for us to have a major debate with the rightists of the RCCK to draw a clear line, distinguish between right and wrong, and decide who wins and who loses, in order to completely change the political face and organizational face of the RCCK and correct the political stance of its members. This is a serious and urgent political task placed before our RCCK.

　　Today, the power of the people is incomparably strong, and the country of the people is incomparably consolidated. The rightists are still a minority, and the majority of the middle elements can only find a way out by relying on the left. As long as we resolutely and faithfully accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and carry out a class struggle on the political and ideological front together with the people of the whole country, and carry the revolution through to the end, we will surely be able to achieve a complete victory in the anti-rightist struggle, and we will surely be able to make the RCCK a political force that truly serves socialism. Now the anti-rightist struggle is unfolding fiercely, we must raise our fighting spirit, oppose sentimentality, we must actively engage in the battle, oppose hesitation and wait-and-see, we must make persistent efforts and go deeper. Indulgence is enough to breed evil, and keeping a boil will inevitably cause future troubles. I believe that all RCCK members who are truly willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and are willing to take the socialist road have brightened their eyes and cleared their minds, and will definitely be able to bravely and consciously throw themselves into this heated struggle to transform themselves and transform the RCCK.

### 生死的斗争，严重的考验

　　生死的斗争，严重的考验
　　中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员兼组织部部长　朱蕴山
    民革内部之有左派、中间派和右派，并且存在着两条路线的斗争，不是从今天开始的，可以说从民革成立的第一天起，这种斗争就已存在着了。为了明辩大是大非，在这里我愿意就民革组织工作的角度，谈一谈民革内部两条路线的根本分歧。
    首先，是在敌我界限问题上，1949年民主派代表会议确定民革仍叫国民党革命委员会，这就是说我们继承和发扬孙中山先生不断进步精神，同时也应划清与国民党反动派的敌我界限。但是右派分子只看到前面的五个字“中国国民党”，看不到后面的五个字“革命委员会”。他们苦心焦思，要把“蒋家天下陈家党”的那个反动国民党，在民革借尸还魂。1949年，我们和全中国人民都在欢天喜地地欢庆解放，但是右派却有人痛哭流涕地感到了“亡党之痛”。1951年在全国范围内大张旗鼓地开展“镇压反革命”运动，我们全体成员都积极参加这个运动。而右派对这一运动，总感觉到切肤之痛，还有的人为被捕的反革命分子说情，或为镇压的反革命分子叫屈。对于国家各项政治运动，右派都采取否定态度。尤其对于肃反运动，强调偏差，否定成绩，反对群众性的肃反运动。这类例子太多，不胜枚举。
    在组织路线上，民革坚持“质量并重”、“巩固与发展相结合”的方针，这个方针，过去是、现在是、将来仍然是正确的。而右派反对这个方针，一味追求数量，不问质量，强调发展，反对巩固，他们把正确路线，诬蔑为“关门主义”，并咒骂坚持正确路线的同志为“恶狗把门”。
    民革建立组织机构，应当以大中城市为主，吸收成员要以中上层为主。而且吸收成员必须政治面貌清楚，宁缺勿滥，才符合统战需要和党章的规定。而右派分子却不然，他们主张到处插柳，遍地开花，不问地区，不问政治条件，不分良莠，只要是原国民党员，一律拉进民革组织中来，他们不要入党手续，不要审查历史，形成“旧国民党归队”。民革的右派之所以如此积极地反对正确的组织方针和组织路线，是为了达到他们反共、反人民、反社会主义的政治阴谋，他们妄图把爪牙伸到全国各个角落，因而网罗所有被斗争对象、不满分子、落后分子甚至刚刚刑满释放分子，都要吸收到民革中来。而且一入民革，多有不合理的要求，对民革组织蓄意起破坏作用。他们还提出所谓“长江大河挟泥沙而俱下”口号，以为这样就能够形成一个人数众多声势浩大的“第二大党”，以便和共产党争一日之短长，一旦风云际会，时机成熟，封建地主、官僚军阀政客一切资产阶级分子，就可以起来夺取他们失去了的天堂，把解放了的人民重行踩在他们脚下。
    解放八年以来，民革党内右派总是随时随地，找寻每一个空子，企图篡改民革的政治方向和组织路线，要把民革从社会主义的轨道上拉出来，由于民革党内坚持正确路线的同志，紧紧依靠着党的领导，团结和争取中间分子，才使民革的政治路线和组织路线的执行，基本上未受到曲解与破坏。但是某些地方、某些部门、某些环节在一定的时间内，右派路线已发生深刻的坏影响，甚而占了上风，组织上受到了一定的危害，情况是极为严重的。以上海市提篮桥区筹备委员会为例，这个区筹备委员会负责人余若南，是右派分子陈铭枢手下的一个骨干。他说民革发展对象，有一千万至一千五百万人，要发展十万人，就有力量，就可与统战部争人民代表和政协委员。为了达到他“大发展”的目的，余若南公然宣称：吸收了反革命，也没有关系。因此，从去年5月到今年5月，从四人发展到五十六人，他本人介绍参加民革的，即达三十三人。其实，类似这样严重恶劣情况的，岂止是上海一市，岂止是一个提篮桥区的筹备委员会。
    这几年来民革党内正确路线和右派路线虽然不断进行斗争，但是因为那时候生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，还未完成，有许多内部矛盾，还未充分显露出来，同志们以团结为重，希望右派分子在党和人民教育之下，接受组织帮助，逐步转变他们自己的反动立场，所以斗争多半是在局部问题上，在较小范围内进行。事实证明，没有共同的基础，就不可能达到真正的团结。我们和右派所争论的，是要不要共产党的领导，要不要社会主义的大问题，这些都是关系我们国家生死存亡的问题，是关系我们民族命运是不是回复到半封建半殖民地老路的问题，也就是说都是政治上的大问题，需要做一篇大文章，不能大题小作，更不能不作。因此，我们有必要和民革右派分子进行一场大辩论，划清界限，辨明谁是谁非，决定谁胜谁负，以彻底改变民革的政治面貌和组织面貌，端正成员的政治立场，这是摆在我们民革面前一个严重的迫切政治任务。
    今天人民的力量无比强大，人民的国家无比巩固，右派分子还是少数，多数的中间分子亦只有靠左才有出路。只要我们坚决地、忠诚地接受中国共产党的领导，和全国人民一道进行一次政治思想战线上的阶级斗争，将革命进行到底，就一定能够取得反右派斗争的彻底胜利，就一定能够使民革成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。现在反右派斗争，正在剧烈展开，我们必须提高斗志，反对温情，必须积极投入战斗，反对徘徊观望，必须再接再厉，深入下去，姑息足以养奸，养痈必遗后患。我相信，一切真正愿意接受中国共产党领导，愿意走社会主义道路的民革成员们，大多数眼睛擦亮了，头脑清醒了，一定可以勇敢的自觉的投身这一场火热的斗争中来改造自己改造民革。
