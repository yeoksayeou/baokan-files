    Multi-Spike Sorghum
    Ten Thousand Mu of Land Increases Production by Five Million Jin
    (Our report) According to the Hebei Daily, nearly ten thousand mu of multi-spike sorghum have been planted this year in the Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative of Wanggezhuang Township, Bohai Agricultural and Fishing Cooperative, and some agricultural cooperatives in Taihezhai Township, Funing County, near the Bohai Sea. This sorghum is now in the grain-filling or red-rice stage. According to evaluations by the township appraisal committees, each mu can produce between 700 and 1,250 jin. Based on the lowest estimated yield, this ten thousand mu of multi-spike sorghum will increase grain production by five million jin compared to planting ordinary sorghum.
    Multi-spike sorghum is a clump-forming, dwarf sorghum. The stems are four to five chi tall, and each sorghum plant tillers into three to seven stalks, all of which can produce good ears. If 3,500 seedlings are kept per mu, after tillering, it can grow into more than 12,000 stalks. This sorghum is suitable for planting on fertile land. If full seedling survival can be ensured (this sorghum has soft sprouts, so the technique must be well mastered during sowing), and four to five thousand jin of base fertilizer are applied per mu, followed by about twenty jin of chemical fertilizer per mu during the tillering period, a bumper harvest can be guaranteed.
    Wanggezhuang Township had planted multi-spike sorghum in 1949, but due to insufficient funds among individual farmers, it could not be widely promoted. It was not until after collectivization that this multi-spike sorghum was widely promoted. (Attached picture)

    多穗高粱
    一万亩土地增产五百万斤
    本报讯　据河北日报报道：今年在靠近渤海的抚宁县王各庄乡东升农业社，渤海农渔社以及太和寨乡一些农业社，种植了近一万亩多穗高粱。现在这种高粱已经灌浆或晒红米。据各乡评比委员会鉴定，每亩能产七百到一千二百五十斤。按最低产量估计，这一万亩多穗高粱将比种普通高粱增产五百万斤粮食。
    多穗高粱是一种丛生的矮高粱。茎高四、五尺，每棵高粱分蘖三至七棵，都能结好穗。如每亩留三千五百棵苗，分蘖后，就能长一万二千多棵。这种高粱宜种在肥沃的土地上，如能保住全苗（这种高粱芽软，播种时要很好掌握技术），每亩施上四、五千斤底肥，在分蘖期间，每亩再追化学肥料二十斤左右，便能保证丰产。
    1949年王各庄乡曾种过多穗高粱，但由于个体农民资金不足，未能推广。直到合作化以后，这种多穗高粱才大量推广起来。（附图片）
