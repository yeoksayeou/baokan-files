To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

      Your newspaper's July 23rd editorial, titled "Is it Acceptable to Disregard Politics in Personnel Matters?" questioned our ministry based on a Xinhua News Agency report of May 28th regarding the Higher Education Ministry's future selection and dispatch of students for overseas study (published in your newspaper on May 29th). The editorial questioned: "What is strange is that some comrades in the Higher Education Ministry, when improving the methods for selecting and dispatching students for overseas study, seem to think that the criticism of 'emphasizing politics and neglecting professional skills' is correct, and seem to think that selecting and dispatching students for overseas study can disregard politics and treat everyone 'equally'." We have conducted a deep examination and self-criticism of this serious issue in the recent rectification and anti-rightist struggle, combined with the study of this editorial. The following is a summary:
      The content of the Xinhua News Agency report was drafted with reference to the "Preliminary Draft of the Summary of the Work of Selecting and Dispatching Students for Overseas Study in Recent Years" prepared by the Department of Student Affairs of our ministry, and was reviewed and approved by the Director of the Department of Student Affairs and the Director of the General Office before publication. Therefore, our ministry should be responsible for the serious errors in the report.
      In the "Preliminary Draft of the Summary of the Work of Selecting and Dispatching Students for Overseas Study in Recent Years" prepared by the Department of Student Affairs of our ministry, it was believed that "in the selection of students for overseas study, there was a tendency in the past to overemphasize political conditions and neglect academic standards." This assessment is obviously wrong and does not conform to the actual situation of selecting students for overseas study in recent years. In the work of selecting and dispatching students for overseas study in recent years, we have implemented the correct policy of the State Council to select students according to the three conditions of politics, professional skills, and physical fitness. The vast majority of the more than 7,000 students met the standard requirements of the above three conditions and achieved excellent academic results abroad. The shortcomings in our work, as Premier Zhou Enlai said at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, were that "there were formalistic shortcomings in the work of reviewing political conditions at that time, so that a few students with poor political qualities were also sent out, and at the same time, insufficient attention was paid to the professional skills and physical fitness of the students for overseas study." Premier Zhou's criticism is completely correct. In the past, in the selection of students for overseas study, we did not pay enough attention to either political conditions or professional skills, and this should be improved in the future, especially the attention to political conditions should be strengthened. The State Council had previously issued instructions that attention must be paid to political conditions when dispatching students for overseas study in the future, but this issue was not clearly raised in our ministry's report to the State Council. The summary draft of the Department of Student Affairs of our ministry only mentioned the need to pay attention to professional skills and did not mention political conditions, and the report did not mention the requirements for political conditions. This is obviously an error in our viewpoint and understanding.
    The reason for the above errors is, on the one hand, that some comrades in our ministry have a serious tendency to separate professional work from politics and a right-leaning view of emphasizing professional skills and neglecting politics. Therefore, as criticized by your newspaper, they wrongly believed that some people in society were correct in criticizing the past selection of students for overseas study as having a "bias towards emphasizing politics and neglecting professional skills." On the other hand, it is also because the leadership of our ministry lacked strong policy principles, had insufficient understanding of the need to pay more attention to political conditions in the selection of students for overseas study in the future, and had weak ideological leadership in normal work. This should be taken as a profound lesson and efforts should be made to improve and enhance it.
    What should also be deeply examined is that after the report on improving the selection and dispatch of students for overseas study was published, some leading comrades in our ministry had already noticed that there were principal errors in the content and considered making corrections at an appropriate time, but did not make a timely statement to correct them, which caused a bad influence. This also shows that we have not grasped important political principles tightly and have poor political vigilance.
    This error event once again exposed that our ministry's work system is not strict enough and that the organizational discipline education of cadres is weak. The "Preliminary Draft of the Summary of the Work of Selecting and Dispatching Students for Overseas Study in Recent Years" prepared by the Department of Student Affairs of our ministry had not been finally revised and had not been reviewed by the ministry leadership, but was handed over to Xinhua News Agency for drafting. At the same time, our ministry's request report to the State Council on the methods for selecting and dispatching students for overseas study in the future had not been formally approved by the State Council, but was published externally. The Department of Student Affairs did not consult with the ministry leadership in advance about such an important report on the student policy sent by Xinhua News Agency before agreeing to publish it. All of these are violations of organizational principles. In the past, similar situations have occurred in our ministry regarding the review and signing of important documents, which not only shows that there are shortcomings in our ministry's relevant leadership system, but also shows that the education of cadres in abiding by work systems and administrative discipline is very insufficient. This is also an important aspect of our future improvement of leadership work.
    In addition to sincerely accepting your newspaper's criticism and making the above explanations and self-criticisms, we will continue to conduct an in-depth examination and correction of the ideological tendency of separating professional work from politics and the shortcomings in the work of dispatching students for overseas study pointed out by Premier Zhou in his government work report at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress in the rectification movement.

### 高等教育部关于留学生选派工作问题的检讨

1957-09-26
第4版()
专栏：

    高等教育部关于留学生选派工作问题的检讨人民日报编辑部：
      你报7月23日题为“用人可以
  不问政治吗？”的社论中，根据新华社5月28日关于高等教育部今后留学生选派工作的报道（你报5月29日刊载），对我部提出责问：“可怪的是高等教育部的一些同志们在改进选派留学生办法的时候，似乎也认为‘重政治、轻业务’的批评是正确的，似乎也认为选派留学生可以不问政治，‘一视同仁’”。我们对于这一严肃的问题，在最近整风及
  反右派斗争中，结合着对这一篇社
  论的学习作了较深刻的检查和检
  讨。现在扼要说明如下：
      新华社报道的内容是参照我部
  留学生管理司所拟“几年来选派留学生工作总结初稿”编写的，发表
  前并经我部留学生管理司司长和办公厅主任先后审阅同意。因此，报道中的严重错误应当由我部负责。
      在我部留学生管理司所拟“几年来选派留学生工作总结初稿”里，曾认为“在选拔留学生工作中过去存在着偏重政治条件，忽视学科水平的倾向”。这种估计显然是错误的，而且也不符合几年来选拔留学生工作的实际情况。在几年来选派出国留学生工作中，我们贯彻执行了国务院关于按照政治、业务、体格三个条件进行选拔的正确方针，七千多名留学生中，绝大部分是符合以上三个条件的标准要求并且在国外取得了优良的学习成绩的。我们工作中的缺点，正如周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上所说的“当时在审查政治条件的工作中有形式主义的缺点，因而还有个别政治不好的学生也被派出去了，同时对留学生的业务和体格条件也有注意不够的地方”。周总理的批评是完全正确的，过去我们在留学生选拔工作中，无论在政治条件方面或者业务条件方面都还有注意不够的地方，今后应当加以改进，特别对政治条件更应当加强注意。国务院对于今后派遣留学生必须加强注意政治条件，原曾有过指示，但是在我部向国务院的报告里并没有明确提出这一问题，而在我部留学生管理司的总结初稿里更是只讲到要注意业务条件而没有讲到政治条件，报道里也没有提到政治条件要求的问题，这显然是我们的观点认识上有错误。
    上述错误之所以产生，一方面是由于我部一些同志在思想上存在着严重的业务脱离政治的倾向和轻政治、重业务的右倾观点，因而正如你报所批评的，他们就错误地认为当时社会上有些人对过去选拔留学生工作有“重政治、轻业务的偏向”的批评是正确的了。另一方面也是由于我部领导上政策原则性不强，对今后选拔留学生应更加强注意政治条件的要求认识不足，并且平时对工作中的思想领导薄弱。这应当引为深刻教训，努力改进和提高。
    还应当深刻检讨的是：在改进留学生选派工作的报道发表之后，我部有些领导同志虽然已经发觉了内容上有原则错误，并且考虑要在适当时机加以补正，但是没有及时声明更正，以致造成不良影响。这也表现了我们对重要政治原则问题抓得不紧，政治警惕性差。
    这次错误事件也又一次暴露出我部工作制度不够严密和对干部的组织纪律教育薄弱。我部留学生管理司所拟“几年来选派留学生工作总结初稿”尚未最后修改，又未经部领导上审查过，即交新华社据以撰稿，同时我部关于今后选派留学生办法向国务院的请示报告，尚未经国务院正式批复，竟对外发表，而新华社送来的有关留学生政策的这样重要的报道稿，留学生管理司事先并未同我部领导同志商量，即同意发表，这都是违反组织原则的。过去我部在重要文稿审核签发方面也曾发生过类似情形，这不仅说明我部在有关领导制度上存在着缺点，并且说明我部领导上对干部遵守工作制度和行政纪律的教育也是非常不够的。这也是我们今后改进领导工作中的一个重要方面。
    我们除诚恳接受你报的批评并作如上的说明检讨外，对于业务脱离政治的思想倾向以及对周总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上所作政府工作报告中所指出的派遣留学生工作中的缺点，将在整风运动中继续作深入检查纠正。
