Scientists Must Maintain Close Ties with the Masses
Dai Songen, Deputy Director of the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Academy of Agricultural Sciences

    After the liberation of Beijing in 1949, I gained the trust and education of the Chinese Communist Party. Later, through five major political movements, I recognized that feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and imperialism were the most vicious enemies of the Chinese people, and I criticized pro-American sentiments, clearly distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy. Especially during the "Three-Anti" movement, with the help of the Party and comrades, I initially realized that my bourgeois professional thinking was serious, mainly manifested in the selfish arrangement of experimental research work. Since then, I have strived to get closer to the Party, strengthen my studies, and be vigilant in overcoming these shortcomings. After the Three Great Transformations, I thought I had passed the socialist hurdle in my thinking.

    When the rightists took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, the Party promptly led us in a resolute counterattack, and I began to realize that I had not yet passed the socialist hurdle in my thinking. My understanding of the struggle between the two lines was still insufficient. For example, some people said that the Party was an amateur and could not lead agricultural scientific research work. Although I did not say this, I agreed with this view in my mind. The problem was that I emphasized specific professional leadership and neglected the leadership on the direction and line. I neglected that the Party leads us to take the socialist road. This is a political line, and also a fundamental issue in scientific work, and it is on this issue that the Party is most expert.

    In 1952, the Party organization of our institution decided to strengthen rural investigation and research work, and implement the policy of agricultural science serving production. In carrying out rural work, the Party guided us to first make friends with the peasants, and through common labor and life, to understand the lives and production of the peasants, and establish revolutionary feelings with the peasants; only on this basis can we successfully summarize their advanced experience, better find out the problems existing in agricultural production, and with the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperation, make agricultural science better serve agricultural production. This is essential for the ideological remolding of intellectuals.

    I have been to the countryside many times, stayed in peasants' homes, and eaten with peasants, but I appeared as an inspector and a rural investigator. I did not stay long and did not have much contact with the peasants, so the emotional foundation was weak.

    Some people think that carrying out rural work is good, but staying in the countryside for a long time will delay the precise research work in the laboratory or experimental field. I used to sympathize with this view. Mainly because when I considered the close combination of internal and external work, I neglected that rural work can accumulate investigation and research materials, understand production conditions, find out problems and solve some problems, clarify research objects, and more importantly, establish deep feelings with the peasants. The establishment of this kind of feeling not only needs to be based on a certain period of rural work, but also needs to maintain close contact with the peasants frequently. If I deliberately stay in the countryside for a longer period, even if it somewhat affects the work in the laboratory or experimental field, it is appropriate in the long run. Of course, the current situation does not allow me to work in the countryside for a long time, but I must always pay attention to how to better approach the peasants. In the future, I must plan to maintain regular contact with the peasants in nearby agricultural cooperatives, understand their lives, learn from their enthusiasm for building socialism, learn from their production experience, and help them solve some solvable production technical problems. After a relatively long period of effort, I believe that I can establish a solid revolutionary feeling with the peasants, so as to transform my thinking and improve my awareness of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    The rightists want us to oppose the leadership of the Party, saying that "amateurs cannot lead professionals." In particular, the rightist ambitious elements such as Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, using the legal organization of the China Democratic League, put forward a complete anti-socialist scientific program. They said that "research work should be done as much as possible to accommodate people," and also proposed that "scientists with the ability to lead scientific research should not hold administrative positions as much as possible, especially older scientists over the age of sixty, who urgently need to pass on their knowledge to future generations, and should do so even more. … Ensure that each scientist has a certain amount of time each year to continuously engage in research work. … Due to the needs of scientific research, scientists can take long-term leave from social activities and administrative work.” These "suggestions" are to ask us to oppose the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to ask us to refuse planned work, to refuse the Party's transfer of our work, to refuse to work in the border areas, to ask us to leave the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to not ask about politics, and to cultivate a purely technical point of view, so that they can manipulate us. This is particularly harmful to agricultural science. Agricultural scientific research must be combined with production and contact with peasants, especially agricultural production is regional, and is a complex, comprehensive, and mass socialist cause. If we leave the leadership of the Party, our research work will inevitably be divorced from reality. Since agricultural production cannot get corresponding development, it will affect socialist industrialization.

    The Party's anti-rightist struggle has educated me, making me realize that the rightists are actually our class enemies, and we must resolutely participate in this struggle; at the same time, I must also strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, have more contact with production practice, have more contact with the peasant masses, stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and firmly take the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

### 科学家要密切联系群众

    科学家要密切联系群众
    农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所副所长　戴松恩
    1949年北京解放后，我就得到了中国共产党的信任和教育。以后经过五大政治运动，我认识了封建主义、官僚资本主义、帝国主义是我国人民最凶恶的敌人，并批判了崇美思想，划清了敌我界线。特别在“三反”运动中，我得到了党和同志们的帮助，初步认识到我的资产阶级业务思想是严重的，主要表现在对试验研究工作的安排上是自私的。从那以后，我更争取靠拢党，加强学习，并随时警惕着克服这些缺点。三大改造以后，我以为在思想上已通过了社会主义这一关。
    当右派分子利用党整风的机会向党猖狂进攻，党及时地领导我们进行坚决的反击，我才开始认识到我并没有在思想上通过社会主义这一关。我对于两条路线的斗争，在认识上还是很不够的。比如，有人说党是外行，不能领导农业科学研究工作。我虽然没有这样说过，但在思想上同意这种说法。毛病出在我强调具体业务领导，而忽视了方针路线上的领导。我忽视了党领导我们走社会主义的道路。这是政治路线，也是科学工作的一个根本问题，正是在这个问题上，党是最为内行的。
    1952年我们机关的党组织确定加强农村的调查研究工作，贯彻农业科学为生产服务的方针。在开展农村工作中，党指导我们先和农民交上朋友，通过共同劳动和生活，来了解农民的生活和生产情况，同农民建立起革命的感情；只有在这种基础上，才能成功地总结他们的先进经验，更好地找出农业生产上存在的问题，并随着农业合作化的发展和巩固，使农业科学更好地为农业生产服务。这对知识分子的思想改造是十分必要的。
    我到农村去过好多次，住过农民的家，和农民一同吃过饭，但是我是以检查工作和作农村调查研究工作的身份出现的，住的时间不久，和农民接触不多，因此感情基础是薄弱的。
    有人认为开展农村工作是好的，但是在农村里住久了会耽误实验室或试验地的精密的研究工作。我曾同情过这种说法。主要是我在考虑内外工作应该密切结合时，忽视了农村工作既可积累调查研究资料，了解生产情况，找出问题并解决一些问题，明确研究对象，而更重要的是又可和农民建立起深厚的感情。这种感情的建立，不仅要通过一定时期的农村工作以打下基础，而且还要经常地和农民保持密切的联系。如果在农村中有目的地多停留一个时期，那怕是多少影响些实验室或试验地的工作，从长远看也是合适的。今天的情况当然不允许我长期在农村中工作，不过我必须随时注意着如何更好地接近农民。今后我必须有计划地和附近农业社的农民保持经常的联系，了解他们的生活，学习他们建设社会主义的热情，学习他们的生产经验，帮助他们解决一些可以解决的生产技术问题。经过比较长时期的努力，我相信能够和农民建立起巩固的革命感情，以改造我的思想，提高我全心全意为人民服务的觉悟。
    右派分子要我们反对党的领导，说什么“外行不能领导内行”，特别是曾昭抡、钱伟长之流的右派野心分子，利用民盟合法组织，提出了一个完整的反社会主义的科学纲领。他们说什么“应尽可能把研究工作去就人”，并且也提出了“有领导科学研究能力的科学家，尽可能不担任行政工作，特别是六十岁以上的老科学家，急需传授后代，更应如此。……保证每个科学家每年有一定的时间连续从事研究工作。……由于进行科学研究工作的需要，科学家对社会活动和行政工作得长期请假”。这些“建议”是要我们反对中国农业科学院的领导，要我们拒绝有计划的工作，拒绝党对我们工作的调动，拒绝去边疆工作，要我们离开中国共产党的领导，不问政治，培养单纯技术观点，好由他们来摆布。这对农业科学来讲是特别有害的。农业科学研究必须结合生产，联系农民，特别是农业生产是有区域性的，并且是复杂而带综合性和群众性的社会主义事业。如果我们离开党的领导，我们的研究工作必然会脱离实际。农业生产既然得不到相应的发展，就会影响社会主义工业化。
    党领导的反右派斗争教育了我，使我认识到右派实际上就是我们的阶级敌人，必须坚决参加这一斗争；同时我也必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习，多接触生产实际，多联系农民群众，站稳立场，明辨是非，在中国共产党领导下，坚决走社会主义道路。
