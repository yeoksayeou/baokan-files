Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 9th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Hu Jian): After more than two months of anti-Rightist struggle in Hunan Province's higher education institutions, the Rightist groups in various schools have disintegrated and suffered a complete defeat. Most of the Rightists have been completely exposed, besieged on all sides, and some have already surrendered, bowing their heads and confessing their crimes to the people. A few Rightists are still resisting stubbornly, and teachers and students remaining in the schools during the summer vacation are further exposing and criticizing them.

During the struggle, more than 16,000 teachers, students, and staff members in various higher education institutions received a vivid and concrete political lesson, and their socialist awareness has been improved to varying degrees. Many students have requested that Marxist-Leninist political courses be added next semester, and some teachers, students, and staff members have applied to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

The revealed materials show that the Rightists in various higher education institutions in Hunan were mostly centered on the Rightists of the China Democratic League, colluding with members of various democratic parties who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party to form anti-communist groups. The main planner of these anti-communist groups was Du Maizhi, Secretary-General of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, who was actually in charge of the League's affairs in Hunan. His direct or indirect accomplices were scattered in various higher education institutions, including Chen Xinmin, President of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Wei Mengke, professor at Hunan Normal College and acting Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League; Xie Shicheng, Dean of Academic Affairs of the Central South Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture and member of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League; Li Zongdao (Jiusan) and Li Fengsun (Workers and Peasants Democratic Party), professors at Hunan Agricultural College; Zheng Yiwen (Workers and Peasants Democratic Party), associate professor at Hunan Medical College, assistant teacher Liu Guoping; Xiong Keli, vice-principal of Changsha Normal College and member of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Wang Guo, deputy director of teaching affairs of this school and Secretary-General of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and other Rightists.

The revealed materials also show that the Rightist groups among the teachers in various schools had close ties with the Rightist groups among the students during the period of great contending and great blooming. They had planned, programmatic, and strategic attacks on the Communist Party on fundamental issues such as opposing the school Party committee system, opposing Marxist-Leninist ideological education, opposing the ideological remolding of intellectuals, opposing the socialist political system, opposing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and negating the achievements of socialist construction. They attempted to seize the leadership of the Communist Party in the schools by replacing the genuine with the spurious.

In mid-June, teachers, students, and staff members of various schools launched a resolute counterattack against the Rightists' attacks. They conducted reasoned struggles with the Rightists on the above-mentioned major issues of right and wrong. Various large and small meetings held by the schools for this purpose numbered several hundred, with the participation of more than 16,700 teachers, students, and staff members. The masses were in high spirits, and many activists worked day and night to collect, study, and sort out the Rightists' anti-communist words and deeds, write articles, and post big-character posters, systematically refuting the Rightists' reactionary fallacies in a thorough manner.

The test of this struggle proved that more than 90% of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members are staunch fighters defending socialist interests. For example, the "Red Flag Combat Team," organized around more than 30 Communist Party members in the History Department of Hunan Normal College, investigated and studied the Rightists' words and deeds from the first day of the struggle, wrote and posted big-character posters, and published the "Red Flag Newspaper," persisting in the struggle despite the Rightists' insults and threats. According to investigations and understanding in four colleges, more than 90% of the Communist Youth League members who had vague understanding and right-leaning thoughts at the beginning of the great blooming and contending have changed in the anti-Rightist struggle, drawn a clear line with the Rightists, and about half of them have become activists in the anti-Rightist struggle. In the struggle, ideological education criticizing right-leaning thought and sentimentalism was also carried out within the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

Now, the Party organizations in various schools are working hard to overcome the complacency and relaxation that have grown due to the initial victory, strengthen specific leadership, and make the anti-Rightist struggle more in-depth and extensive.

    右派集团全线溃退　群众觉悟空前提高
    湖南高等学校反右派斗争大有收获
    斗争中证明90％以上的共产党员和共青团员经得起考验
    新华社长沙9日电　新华社记者胡坚报道：湖南省高等学校经过两个多月来的反右派斗争后，各校的右派集团都已土崩瓦解，全线溃退。大部分右派分子丑态毕露，四面楚歌，有的已经缴械投降，向人民低头请罪。有少数右派分子仍在顽抗，暑假留在学校里的教师、学生正在对他们进一步进行揭露和批判。
    在斗争中，各高等学校的一万六千多名师生员工上了一次生动具体的政治课，都不同程度地提高了社会主义觉悟，许多学生要求下学期增设马列主义政治课，还有一些师生员工已申请要求参加共产党和共青团。
    揭露出来的材料说明，湖南各高等学校里的右派分子，大都以民盟右派为核心，串连各民主党派中对共产党不满的分子参加，形成一个个的反共集团。这些反共集团的主要策划人是实际负责湖南盟务的民盟省委秘书长杜迈之。各高等学校里都散布着他的直接或间接的同谋者，其中包括中南矿冶学院院长、民盟中央委员陈新民；湖南师范学院教授、民盟湖南省委代理主任委员魏猛克；中南土木建筑学院教务长、民盟省委委员谢世澄；湖南农学院教授李宗道（九三）、李凤荪（农工）；湖南医学院副教授郑艺文（农工）、助教刘果平；长沙师范专科学校副校长、民革长沙市委委员熊克立，和这个学校的副教导主任、民进长沙市委秘书长王果等右派分子。
    揭露出来的材料还说明，各校教师中的右派集团在大鸣大放中几乎都和学生中的右派集团取得密切联系。他们有计划、有纲领、有策略地在反对学校党委制、反对马列主义思想教育、反对知识分子思想改造、反对社会主义政治制度、反对肃清反革命和否定社会主义建设成就等根本性问题上，向共产党发起猖狂进攻。他们企图用偷梁换柱的办法夺取共产党在学校中的领导权。
    6月中旬，各校的师生员工对右派分子的进攻展开了坚决的反击。他们就上述大是大非问题，同右派分子进行了说理斗争。各校为此所召开的各种大小会议有好几百次，参加斗争的师生员工有一万六千七百余人。群众斗志高昂，许多积极分子废寝忘食地搜集、研究和整理右派分子的反共言行，写文章、贴大字报，系统地把右派分子的反动谬论驳斥得体无完肤。
    经过这次斗争考验证明：90％以上的共产党员和共青团员都是捍卫社会主义利益的坚强战士。例如，以湖南师范学院历史系三十多名共产党员为核心组织的“红旗战斗队”，从斗争的第一天起，就调查研究右派言行，写贴大字报，出版“红旗报”，尽管在右派分子谩骂、威胁下，一直坚持战斗。据四个学院的调查了解：在大放大鸣初期，认识模糊、思想右倾的共青团员有90％以上在反右派斗争中转变过来了，与右派分子划清了界限，其中约有半数成为反右派斗争中的积极分子。在斗争中，共产党、共青团内部也进行了批判右倾思想和温情主义的思想教育。
    现在，各校的中共组织正努力克服因初战获胜而滋长的松懈自满情绪，加强具体领导，使反右派斗争更加深入、广泛地开展起来。
