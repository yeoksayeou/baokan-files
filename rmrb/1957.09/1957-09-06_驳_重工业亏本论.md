    Refuting the "Heavy Industry Loss Theory"
    Rightist Wang Hengshou fabricated and put forward the "Heavy Industry Loss Theory" fallacy. He spread it everywhere, saying, "The more heavy industry is developed, the more losses are incurred. It would have been better to have fewer of the 156 projects."

    At the Shanghai Municipal CPPCC symposium of the higher education and science and technology group, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics professor Wang Weizhong cited many facts and statistics to refute the "Heavy Industry Loss Theory": "In the 1956 national budget revenue items, enterprises turned over 15.4 billion in profits, accounting for 64% of the total revenue. Among them, the industrial sector turned over 5.5 billion in profits, accounting for 40% of the profits turned over by enterprises. I ask you, is this a loss?"

    Shanghai Boiler Factory Chief Engineer Li Bide spoke about the facts of the factory, confirming that Wang Hengshou's view was absurd. He said, "The production of the Shanghai Boiler Factory is constantly developing. Comparing 1956 with 1952, the total output value has increased more than six times; the cost of comparable products has been reduced to 49%; and profits have increased many times. Heavy industrial factories in this city, such as the machine tool factory and the diesel engine factory, all overfulfill their tasks every year."

    Wang Hengshou did not dare to answer directly, still quibbling, "Regarding the issue of heavy industry losses, it was said at a standing committee meeting of the Shanghai branch of the Jiusan Society this year. At that time, the scientific research funding of Fudan University was reduced to 4,500 yuan in the first quarter. How is that enough? I was very anxious. I thought this was because the state finance had a deficit, and it was because heavy industry was being developed too much and incurring losses. I wanted to use this fact to ask Lu Yudao to report to the People's Committee."

    However, Professor Wang Mingqi stood up and asked him: "You said that the funding for the first quarter was 4,500 yuan. In fact, three months ago, Fudan's scientific research funding had reached more than 160,000 yuan. Isn't this another unfounded slander?"

    Xue Deyi, an old professor at East China Normal University, continued to speak: "Wang Hengshou portrays industrial construction as a complete mess, with no achievements. However, even the United Nations, in its bulletin published in June of this year, had to admit that the growth rate of China's total industrial output value last year was the highest in the world. Wang Hengshou hangs the sign of a scientist, casually saying unfounded words, what is the purpose?"

    Wang Weizhong and Li Bide further analyzed that giving priority to the development of heavy industry is the direction of socialist industrialization. Without heavy industry, there would be no solid national defense, transportation, light industry, and agriculture could not develop, and our national independence would not be guaranteed. Wang Hengshou's set of fallacies is actually completely to oppose heavy industry construction, that is, to fundamentally oppose socialism and oppose the general line. This is the essence of the "Heavy Industry Loss Theory."

### 驳“重工业亏本论”

    驳“重工业亏本论”
    右派分子王恒守无中生有地提出了“重工业亏本论”的谰言。他到处散布说：“重工业多搞多亏本，一百五十六项工程少办几个就好了。”
    在上海市政协座谈会高教和科技界小组会上，上海财经学院教授王惟中列举了很多事实和统计数字，驳斥了“重工业亏本论”：“在1956年国家预算收入项目中，企业上缴利润有一百五十四亿，占总收入64％。其中工业部门上缴利润五十五亿，占企业上缴利润的40％。请问，这是亏本吗？”
    上海锅炉厂总工程师李彼得说出了该厂的事实，证实王恒守的看法是荒谬的。他说：“上海锅炉厂的生产是不断发展的，拿1956年和1952年比较，生产总值增加到六倍多；可比产品的成本，降低到49％；利润则增加了好多倍。本市的机床厂、柴油机厂等重工业工厂都是年年超额完成任务的。”
    王恒守不敢正面答辩，仍狡辩说：“关于重工业亏本的问题，是今年在九三学社上海分社一个常委会上说的。那时因为复旦大学科学研究经费第一季度减少为四千五百元。这怎够呢？我很焦急。我想这是国家财政有赤字，是重工业搞多搞亏本的。我想拿这事实要求卢于道向人民委员会反映。”
    但是，王鸣岐教授起来问他：“你说第一季度经费是四千五百元，事实上，三个月以前，复旦的科学研究经费已达到十六万多元，这不又是一个无中生有的诬蔑？”
    华东师大老教授薛德焴接着发言说：“王恒守把工业建设描绘成一塌糊涂，没有成绩。可是连联合国在今年6月发表的公报，也不得不承认去年我国工业总产值的增长速度是全世界第一位的。王恒守挂着科学家的招牌，随便乱说没有根据的话，目的何在呢？”
    王惟中和李彼得进一步分析说：优先发展重工业，是社会主义工业化的方针。没有重工业，就没有巩固的国防，交通运输业、轻工业和农业就不可能发展，我们国家的独立就没有保障。王恒守的这一套谰言其实完全是为了反对重工业建设，也就是从根本上反对社会主义，反对总路线，这就是“重工业亏本论”的本质。
