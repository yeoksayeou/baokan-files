    Improving Soil to Increase Yield Per Unit Area
    Large Areas of Low-Yielding Fields in Guangdong Increase Production
    (Our newspaper reports) More than 5 million mu of low-yielding rice fields in Guangdong Province that have undergone soil improvement this year have initially changed their original low-yield state. The 4.1 million mu of low-yielding fields that had their soil improved in the early rice crop this year have generally increased rice production by 20% to 50% per mu, with some increasing by more than 100%, except in disaster areas. In the Gao Yao, Shao Guan, and He Pu special districts, the rice seedlings are also growing well in the low-yielding fields that have been improved.

    Although Guangdong Province has extremely favorable natural conditions for increasing grain production, the province's total average yield is very low. Last year's average rice yield per mu was only over 510 jin; the rate of increase was also very slow, averaging only a little over 17 jin per year from 1952 to 1956. The main reason is that there are too many low-yielding fields. It is estimated that low-yielding fields with an annual output below the provincial average account for more than 60% of the province's paddy field area.

    In order to find the key to increasing production, last year the Huiyang, Gao Yao, Shao Guan, and other special districts organized a large number of technical cadres to go deep into the townships and communes to conduct investigations. They discovered many cases of increased production due to soil improvement. For example, the first commune of Dapo Township in Dianbai County had 200 mu of clayey soil fields, and last year the average yield per mu jumped from 200 jin in the previous year to 900 jin.

    Guangdong Province initially plans to improve 7.5 million to 8 million mu of soil next year and requires that the province's more than 20 million mu of low-yielding fields be gradually transformed into high-yielding fields within a few years. Since the beginning of autumn, farmers in various places have adopted methods such as returning rice straw to the fields and opening ditches to drain springs, eliminate waterlogging, acidity, and alkalinity to continue soil improvement work and strive for a bumper late rice harvest.

### 改良土壤提高单位面积产量  广东大片低产田增产

    改良土壤提高单位面积产量
    广东大片低产田增产
    本报讯　广东省今年经过土壤改良的五百多万亩低产稻田，已经初步改变原来的低产面貌。今年早造改良土壤的四百一十多万亩低产田，除灾区外，一般的每亩增产稻谷二成至五成，有的增产一倍以上。高要、韶关、合浦等专区经过改良的低产田，目前禾苗也生长良好。
    广东省虽然有着增产粮食的极其优越的自然条件，但是全省总平均产量却很低。以去年平均每亩稻谷产量仅达五百一十多斤；增产的速度也很缓慢，从1952年到1956年，平均每年仅增长十七斤多。原因主要是低产田太多。据估计，年产量达不到全省平均水平的低产田约占全省水田面积的60％以上。
    为了探找增产的关键，去年惠阳、高要、韶关等专区，曾组织大批技术干部深入乡、社，进行调查。他们发现了许多因为改良土壤而增产的事例。如电白县大坡乡第一社有二百亩土质粘结田，去年平均每亩产量由前年的二百斤一跃增加到九百斤。
    广东省初步计划明年改良土壤七百五十万亩到八百万亩，并要求在几年内把全省二千多万亩低产田逐步改造成为高产田。入秋以来各地农民采取稻秆回田和开沟排泉、排除渍、酸、碱等办法，继续进行土壤改良工作，争取晚稻丰收。
