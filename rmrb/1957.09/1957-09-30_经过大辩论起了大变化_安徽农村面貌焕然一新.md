    The socialist great debate, centered on the grain issue, is reaching a climax in agricultural cooperatives throughout Anhui Province. Regions that have undergone the great debate are seeing a completely new look in the countryside.

    **Looking at the New Rural Landscape from the Perspective of Grain Situation**

    Before the great debate, the province's summer grain procurement had only completed 980 million jin within three months, accounting for 67.3% of the target. After the launch of the great debate in late August, as of the September 9 statistics, the province's summer grain procurement had completed 1.12 billion jin, accounting for 77% of the target. In less than ten days, it increased by nearly 10%. The suburbs of Wuhu City have already exceeded the summer grain procurement target. According to statistics on September 10, the province's autumn grain pre-delivery and pre-sale has already amounted to 1.89 billion jin, accounting for 34.44% of the target, more than double the amount stored in the same period in the bumper year of 1955.

    Concealing grain production has been exposed and criticized in the great debate, and the vast number of cadres and masses have reported the actual output. At the district, township, and cooperative level expanded cadre meeting held by the Fuyang County Committee, cadres from 281 cooperatives in 59 townships reported 4 million jin of concealed grain. In Chang'an Cooperative of Zongyang County, 17 teams reported the actual output, reporting a total of more than 50,000 jin of concealed grain. The Fourth Brigade also reported concealing 3,200 jin of early-season grain.

    The trend of saving grain has also improved. According to a survey of four teams in Xinmin Cooperative, Fanchang County, originally 25% of households ate four meals of dry rice a day, wasting some grain; now they have all made plans to save grain and not ask the government for more grain. In Jingxi Cooperative, Wuhu County, after the great debate, most of the masses changed from eating three meals of dry rice a day to two dry and one thin, or one dry and two thin.

    **Conduct the Great Debate First Among Cadres**

    Everywhere, the great debate is first conducted among cadres. The Fuyang County Committee held a three-level expanded cadre meeting with 772 participants from districts, townships, and cooperatives for debate. According to the problems reflected at the meeting, the central content of the debate was: Is the unified purchase and sale of grain good or not? Has grain production increased or decreased compared to the past? Is the state procurement task heavy? Is the grain ration standard for farmers low? And so on. The main methods of the debate are to present facts, reason things out, recall, calculate accounts, and compare. For example, through instances such as "People starved to death in famine years before liberation, and now there is grain to eat and no worry during disasters," and "Half a year of chaff and vegetable rations before liberation, now there is surplus grain to eat from summer to autumn, and good noodles can be eaten during the New Year," cadres were specifically educated, helping them clarify some confused concepts and wrong ideas, distinguish between right and wrong, and inspire confidence in doing a good job in grain work. Cadres of Yongchang Cooperative in Wangren District were educated at the meeting and guaranteed to sell more than 20,000 jin of surplus grain to the state upon their return.

    Then, go deep into backward cooperatives and carry out the great debate with emphasis. The great debate on grain issues in various counties of the Wuhu Special Zone focuses on backward cooperatives that clamor the loudest about the unified purchase and sale being bad and the grain ration standard being low. According to statistics, among the 392 backward cooperatives in the region, 79 are the focus of the great debate on grain, and 302 cadres have been dispatched to specifically strengthen leadership.

    **Let People Speak Out Before the Debate**

    When launching the great debate on grain issues within cooperatives, the first step everywhere is to launch a "speaking out" campaign under the leadership of the Party branch and work teams. It was seen in the "speaking out" that poor peasants and the vast majority of lower-middle peasants support the unified purchase and sale of grain, and they demanded the implementation of the method of "grading and quantifying according to people." Poor peasant members of Beiyu Cooperative in Shucheng County reflected, "Our grain ration is enough to eat, we don't want to raise it, but it must be set reasonably. Adults and children cannot have the same amount." A small number of upper-middle peasants and landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries released many reactionary fallacies, attempting to abolish the unified purchase and sale method. Xie Anyuan, an old upper-middle peasant in Beiyu Cooperative, Chengbei Township, Shucheng County, shouted everywhere that the grain ration was not enough to eat, saying, "I can't even climb the field ridge." "Eight out of ten people are so hungry that only two are left." And incited others saying: "People get desperate and talk nonsense, cattle get desperate and run amok, if you tighten the screws, there will be an explosion, the Communist Party's regime will not be stable either." More than 90% of the upper-middle peasants in Huaixin Third Cooperative, Changgang Township, Shuijiahu District, Shou County, shouted that the grain ration standard was low. Due to the clamoring of wealthy peasants, a small number of township and cooperative cadres with right-leaning ideas were confused, and without analysis or research, they blindly proposed to reduce procurement tasks. A cooperative director in Tongcheng County said, "I don't care if you call me capitalist or localist, anyway, 520 jin is not enough to eat, it must be at least 700 jin."

    **Rely on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants to Launch the Great Debate**

    After the "speaking out," the debate was launched. The method was to rely on activists, poor peasants, and the vast majority of lower-middle peasants to launch a great debate of presenting facts and reasoning. The central questions of the debate were: Is the unified purchase and sale good or not? Is the grain ration standard low or not?

    In the debate of "Is the unified purchase and sale good or not?" a large number of facts were presented from the distant past to the present, and the clamoring of wealthy middle peasants was refuted with reason. A poor peasant in Wucha Cooperative, Huaiyuan County, said, "The world before liberation was not like a world, grain prices rose several times a day. Once I went to Bengbu to sell two dan of wheat, and the price I sold it for was only worth two dou of grain money when I got home. After a few days, the money from two dan of grain could only buy two boxes of matches and one jin of kerosene. If it weren't for the unified purchase and sale after liberation, how could grain prices be so stable? I think the unified purchase and sale is good for everyone." Sun Changgong, a poor peasant in Huaihe Cooperative, Wuhe County, said, "You (referring to wealthy middle peasants who oppose unified purchase and sale) are conscienceless. We suffer disasters here every year. If the government hadn't transferred grain for us to eat, you would have starved to death long ago!" Jin Daodeng, a poor peasant in Huaixin Cooperative, Shou County, refuted the fallacies released by Jin Zhaoqi, an upper-middle peasant who was dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale, at the debate meeting, saying, "Jin Zhaoqi is a grain dealer. He used to mix bran and water when selling grain, and he exploited 30 to 40 dan of grain a year. The unified purchase and sale blocked this path of exploitation, of course he is dissatisfied." Through debate, the vast majority of cooperative members believed that the unified purchase and sale was good. According to statistics from Dongqing Cooperative, Fuyang County, among the 1,101 cooperative members who participated in the debate, 1,051 supported the unified purchase and sale, accounting for 95.5%.

    In the debate of "Is the grain ration standard low or not?" the method of detailed accounting was used to specifically illustrate that the standard was not low, but had increased year by year, powerfully refuting the clamoring of wealthy middle peasants that "the grain ration is not enough to eat," and also educating cadres and the masses. Chang'an Cooperative, Zongyang County, calculated three accounts: The first account is that grain rations have increased year by year since liberation. Before liberation, the average grain ration for each person in the cooperative was only 406 jin per year. After liberation, it has increased year by year, and by 1956, in addition to completing the state procurement task, each person had reached an average of 640 jin of grain per year. The grain ration for 1957 is expected to increase further. The second account is the increase in population and livestock, which has expanded the consumption. It shows that in the past few years since liberation, grain production has increased a lot due to the strong support of the government, but the main reason why the amount of grain retained for rations is not very generous is that the speed of increase in people and livestock is very fast. Since the implementation of unified purchase and sale in 1953, Chang'an Cooperative alone has increased by 1,508 children under the age of four. The third account is that farmers eat more grain than workers and cadres, not less. The detailed accounting results proved that each farmer eats an average of 32 jin more rice than workers and more than 70 jin more rice than cadres throughout the year. Through debate, it was unanimously agreed that the grain ration standard was not low, and they said, "We eat more now than in the past, and still say it's not enough, that's lying with your eyes open."

    **Conduct Reasoning Struggle Against Grain Speculators**

    At the same time as the debate, appropriate reasoning struggles were also conducted against some grain speculators and those who engaged in destructive behavior against the unified purchase and sale, cracking down on their arrogance. Lihe Agricultural Cooperative, Guanyi Township, Feixi County, launched a reasoning struggle and criticism in the entire cooperative against a landlord element, a counter-revolutionary element, and five wealthy middle peasants who incited trouble over grain rations, did not sell surplus grain, and undermined the unified purchase and sale, cracking down on their clamoring and destructive activities, and helping farmers further distinguish between right and wrong on the grain issue. After the struggle, a lower-middle peasant in the cooperative reflected, "I was deceived by them in the past, and followed them and shouted blindly that the grain ration was not enough to eat. In the future, I will stand firm and not listen to their nonsense."

    **Start a Climax of Pre-Delivery of Autumn Grain**

    On the basis of the debate and struggle and achieving victory, a climax of pre-delivery and pre-sale of autumn grain was launched. In the grain delivery, labor was specifically arranged, so that production and grain delivery were not delayed. Adjustments were made to the improper allocation of procurement tasks based on the actual harvest of autumn grain (mainly early and mid-season rice); some reasonable demands of the masses were properly handled, and the method of "grading and quantifying according to people" was widely publicized and implemented, making the grain procurement work more reasonable.

    经过大辩论起了大变化
    安徽农村面貌焕然一新
    本报讯　安徽省各地农业社以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论，已经形成高潮。经过大辩论的地区，农村面貌焕然一新。
    从粮食情况看农村新面貌
    全省夏粮征购，在大辩论以前的三个月内，仅完成了九亿八千多万斤，占任务数的67.3％。8月底，各地开展大辩论后，截至9月9日统计，全省夏粮征购已经完成了十一亿二千多万斤，占任务数的77％，不到十天时间就增加了近10％。芜湖市郊区已经超额完成了夏粮征购任务。全省秋粮预交预售，据9月10日的统计，已入库粮食十八亿九千多万斤，占任务数的34.44％，比丰收的1955年同期入库粮食增加了一倍多。
    瞒产行为在大辩论中受到了揭发和批判，广大干部和群众纷纷报实了产量。阜阳县委召开的区、乡、社三级扩干会议上，有五十九个乡二百八十一个社的干部报出了四百万斤瞒产粮。枞阳县长安社十七个小队报实了产量，共报出五万多斤瞒产粮，第四大队还报出了午季瞒产三千二百斤。
    节约粮食的风气也有了进步。据繁昌县新民社四个队的调查，原来有25％的户一天吃四顿干饭，浪费了一些粮食；现在都作了计划，节约用粮，不向政府多要粮食了。芜湖县荆西社，大辩论以后，大部分群众由原来一天三顿干饭，改为一天吃两干一稀或一干两稀。
    先在干部中进行大辩论
    各地都是首先在干部中进行大辩论。阜阳县委是召开区、乡、社七百七十二人参加的三级扩干会议进行辩论的。根据会上反映出来的问题，辩论的中心内容是：粮食统购统销到底好不好？粮食产量比过去是提高了还是降低了？国家征购任务是否重？农民口粮标准是否低了？等等。辩论的主要方法是摆事实、讲道理、回忆、算账、对比。例如：通过“解放前荒年饿死人，现在受灾有粮吃不发愁”，“解放前糠菜半年粮，现在夏季吃到秋后还有余粮，过年还可以吃好面”等等实例对比，具体地教育了干部，帮助干部澄清了一些糊涂观念和错误思想，分清了大是大非，鼓舞了搞好粮食工作的信心。王仁区永昌社的干部在会上受到了教育，保证回去将二万多斤余粮出售给国家。
    然后，深入到落后社有重点地开展大辩论。芜湖专区各县粮食问题的大辩论，都以叫嚣统购统销不好、叫喊口粮标准低等最厉害的落后社为重点。据统计，全区三百九十二个落后社中有七十九个为粮食大辩论的重点，并派出了三百零二名干部具体加强了领导。
    辩论之前先要鸣放
    各地在社内开展关于粮食问题大辩论的时候，第一步是在党支部和工作组的领导下开展鸣放。在鸣放中看出：贫农和绝大多数的下中农都是拥护粮食统购统销的，他们要求实行“以人分等定量”的办法。舒城县北玉社贫农社员反映说：“我们口粮够吃，不要提高了，但要定得合理。不能大人、小孩一样多”。少数上中农和地主、富农、反革命分子放出了不少反动谬论，妄图取消统购统销办法。舒城县城北乡北玉社老上中农解安元，就到处叫喊口粮不够吃，说：“田埂也上不去了。”“十成人饿得只剩下两成了。”并进行煽动说：“人急讲胡话、牛急压横耙，扣紧必炸，共产党的江山也不稳了。”寿县水家湖区长岗乡淮新三社的上中农中有90％以上的户叫喊口粮标准低。由于富裕农民的叫嚷，迷惑了少数有右倾思想的乡、社干部，他们不加分析研究，盲目提出要减少征购任务。桐城县有一个社主任说：“不管你讲我资本主义还是本位主义，反正五百二十斤不够吃，最少也得七百斤。”
    依靠贫农下中农展开大辩论
    鸣放之后，就展开了辩论。做法是依靠积极分子、贫农和绝大多数下中农，展开摆事实、说道理的大辩论。辩论的中心问题是统购统销好不好？口粮标准低不低？
    在“统购统销好不好”的辩论中，由远到近地摆出了大量事实，以理驳倒了富裕中农的叫嚣。怀远县五岔社有一个贫农说：“解放前的世界不像个世界，粮价一天涨几回，有一次我到蚌埠卖了二担麦子，卖的价钱回到家一天只值二斗粮食钱了，过没几天，二担粮食的钱只能买二打洋火、一斤洋油了。解放后要不是统购统销，粮价那能有这样稳当，我看统购统销对那个人都有好处。”五河县淮河社贫农孙长弓说：“你们（指反对统购统销的富裕中农）这些没良心的，俺这里年年受灾，要是没有政府调来粮食吃，早就把你们饿死啦！”寿县淮新社贫农金道登，在辩论会上针对上中农金照启对统购统销不满而放出的谬论，进行反驳说：“金照启是粮贩子，贩粮食时掺糠兑水都干过，一年要剥削到三、四十担粮食，统购统销堵死了这条剥削路，他当然不满。”通过辩论，绝大多数的社员 都认为统购统销好。据阜阳县东清社统计，在参加辩论的一千一百零一名社员中，有一千零五十一人拥护统购统销，占95.5％。
    在“口粮标准低不低”的辩论中，通过算细账的办法，具体地说明了标准不低而是年年有了增加，有力地驳斥了富裕中农“口粮不够吃”的叫嚣，也教育了干部和群众。枞阳县长安社算了三笔账：第一笔账是解放后口粮年年有了增加。解放前全社每人每年平均只有四百零六斤口粮。解放后逐年有了增长，到1956年，除完成国家征购任务外，每人每年平均已达到六百四十斤口粮。1957年的口粮预计还要增加。第二笔账是人口和牲畜的增加，扩大了食用量。说明解放后几年来，由于政府大力支持，粮食增产很多，但口粮的留用量还不大宽裕的主要原因是：人、畜增加的速度很快。长安全社自1953年实行统购统销以来，仅四周岁以下的小孩就增加了一千五百零八人。第三笔账是农民比工人、干部的口粮吃得多些，不是吃得少些。算细账结果证明：全年每个农民比工人平均要多吃三十二斤米，比干部要多吃七十多斤米。通过辩论，一致认为口粮标准不低，表示说：“现在比过去吃得多，还说不够吃，这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。”
    对粮食投机分子进行说理斗争
    在辩论的同时，还对一些粮食投机分子、对统购统销有破坏行为的分子进行了适当的说理斗争，打击了他们的嚣张气焰。肥西县馆驿乡李河农业社对煽动闹口粮、不卖余粮、破坏统购统销的一个地主分子，一个反革命分子和五个富裕中农，在全社范围内开展了说理斗争和批判，打击了他们的叫嚣和破坏活动，帮助农民在粮食问题上进一步分清了大是大非。斗争后该社有一个下中农反映：“过去受了他们骗，跟在他们后面也瞎叫口粮不够吃，今后要站稳立场，不听他们的鬼话了。”
    掀起预交秋粮的热潮
    在经过辩论和斗争并取得胜利的基础上，掀起预交预售秋粮的热潮。在送粮中，具体安排好劳动力，做到了生产、送粮两不误。对征购任务分配不当的，根据秋粮（主要是早、中稻）的实收情况作了调整；对群众一些合理的要求作了正确的处理，普遍宣传和贯彻了“以人分等定量”的办法，使粮食的征购工作做得更加合理。
