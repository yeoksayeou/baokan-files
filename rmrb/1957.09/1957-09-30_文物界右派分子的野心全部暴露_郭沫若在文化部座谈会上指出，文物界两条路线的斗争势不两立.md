Xinhua News Agency Special Article: The Ministry of Culture recently held a series of symposiums to focus on exposing and refuting the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of right-wingers in the cultural relics field.

The materials revealed at the meeting showed that right-wingers from democratic parties such as the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and the China Democratic League, under the personal planning of Zhang Bojun, Li Boqiu, and others, organized and colluded with right-wingers in the cultural relics field in Beijing and other places during the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending to launch a large-scale attack on the Ministry of Culture and cultural relics departments in various regions. In the cultural relics field in Beijing, there were Ye Gongchuo and Qi Nianheng of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, in Zhejiang there was Song Yunbin of the China Democratic League, in Luoyang there was Guo Wenxuan, deputy director of the Cultural Relics Management Committee and member of the China Democratic League, and in Hunan, there was also Chen Yuxin, director of the Cultural Relics Management Committee and member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. These right-wingers colluded with right-wingers within museums, such as Fu Zhenlun and Ma Feibai of the Museum of History, and Li Zegang, curator of the Anhui Provincial Museum, echoing each other, setting fires and spreading poison everywhere, and some even organized anti-Party cliques, attempting to usurp the leadership of the cultural relics cause.

Right-wingers in the cultural relics field denied the great achievements of the socialist cultural relics cause, saying that the cultural relics cause was "not as good as before." Song Yunbin, Chen Yuxin, and others slandered the Communist Party for "destroying cultural relics." Song Yunbin spread rumors, saying: "During the land reform, almost all private collections of books were burned, which is equivalent to Qin Shihuang burning books." The right-wingers also said, "The Communist Party has a peasant consciousness, opposes culture, and opposes science." They openly clamored to "rescue cultural relics."

While spreading the above fallacies, the right-wingers openly or covertly put forward the slogan of canceling the leadership of the Communist Party. Chen Mengjia of the Institute of Archaeology demanded the "adjustment" of the leaders of the Institute of Archaeology, to be led by "non-Party experts." Zhang Boju of Beijing proposed to organize a "Central Cultural Relics Inspection Committee" led by so-called "experts" outside the Ministry of Culture, plotting to usurp the Party's leadership over the cultural relics cause.

The right-wingers also opposed Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies on the cultural relics cause, and promoted the capitalist line. They attacked the government's ban on the export of cultural relics and opposed the museum's policy of conducting patriotic and socialist ideological education and scientific and cultural education for the people. Right-winger Chen Yuxin used his position as director of the Cultural Relics Management Committee to steal precious cultural relics and books and periodicals to his own home. Feng Guorui, the right-wing librarian of the Gansu Provincial Library, used the name of holding exhibitions to defraud and sell valuable Dunhuang paintings, obtaining huge profits. It was this Feng Guorui who, when attacking the Party, repeatedly said: "The leadership does not pay attention to the preservation of cultural relics."

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was invited to attend the symposium, as well as well-known figures in academic circles and cultural relics workers, all listed facts and powerfully refuted the fallacies of the right-wingers. Guo Moruo said that the Communist Party and the People's Government attach great importance to the cultural relics cause. He pointed out that the struggle between the two lines in the cultural relics field is irreconcilable. We must adhere to the socialist line, and use the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to excavate, sort out, and study cultural relics heritage, so as to conduct socialist and patriotic education for the people. We resolutely oppose the semi-colonial and semi-feudal line of a few people monopolizing cultural relics and stealing and selling cultural relics. Jian Bozan refuted the right-wingers' propaganda that cultural relics work is "purely technical" and should be "isolated from politics," which is purely a smokescreen to cover up their opposition to Marxism-Leninism. Liang Sicheng, Pei Wenzhong, Wu Han, and others all refuted the right-wingers' fallacy of "the Communist Party despises cultural relics work" based on the facts they had personally seen.

Wang Yeqiu, Director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics Affairs of the Ministry of Culture, spoke at the meeting. Wang Yeqiu pointed out that the Party's leadership over the cultural relics cause in recent years has not been too much but not enough, and it is not a matter of "withdrawing" but of greatly strengthening it; the cultural relics cause must take the socialist road, which has been adhered to in the past, but is far from enough; the work of protecting cultural relics by taking the mass line must also be vigorously promoted in the future; in the work of uniting experts and technicians, special attention should be paid to strengthening mutual assistance and self-reform in politics and ideology.

Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture, also spoke at the meeting. He talked about the relationship between the construction of cultural and educational undertakings and the country's economic construction, and hoped that cultural relics workers would understand that the country's socialist industrialization is the material basis for the development of cultural and educational undertakings, and that only the consolidation and prosperity of the country can truly protect historical relics.

    文物界右派分子的野心全部暴露
    郭沫若在文化部座谈会上指出，文物界两条路线的斗争势不两立
    新华社特约稿　文化部最近连续召开座谈会，集中揭露和驳斥文物界右派分子的反共反社会主义言行。
    会上揭露的材料说明，农工民主党、民盟等民主党派的右派分子，在章伯钧、李伯球等亲自策划之下，在大鸣大放期间组织和串连北京和各地文物界的右派分子向文化部和各地文物部门大举进攻。在北京文物界有农工民主党的叶恭绰、齐念衡等，在浙江有民盟的宋云彬，在洛阳有文管会副主任、民盟郭文轩，在湖南，也有文管会主任、民革陈浴新。这些右派分子同博物馆内部的右派分子，如历史博物馆的傅振伦、马非百，安徽省博物馆馆长李则刚等相互勾结呼应，到处点火放毒，有的并组织反党小集团，企图篡夺文物事业的领导权。
    文物界右派分子否定社会主义文物事业的巨大成就，说文物事业“今不如昔”。宋云彬、陈浴新等诬蔑共产党“破坏文物”，宋云彬造谣说：“土地改革时把民间藏书几乎烧光，等于秦始皇焚书”。右派分子们还说，“共产党是农民意识，反对文化，反对科学”他们公开叫嚣要来“抢救文物”。
    右派分子在散布上述反对谬论的同时，就公开或变相地提出取消共产党领导的口号。考古研究所陈梦家要求“调整”考古研究所的领导人，由“非党专家”来领导。北京的张伯驹，提出在文化部之外另组织由所谓“专家领导”的“中央文物检查委员会”，阴谋篡夺党对文物事业的领导权。
    右派分子还反对马克思列宁主义和党对文物事业的政策，宣扬资本主义的路线。他们攻击政府禁止文物出口的法令，反对博物馆向人民群众进行爱国主义社会主义思想教育和科学文化教育的方针。右派分子陈浴新利用担任文管会主任职务的便利，把珍贵文物、书刊盗窃到自己家里。甘肃省图书馆长、右派分子冯国瑞，利用搞展览名义将名贵敦煌画骗卖，获得巨利，也就是这个冯国瑞在向党进攻时，却口口声声说什么：“领导上不重视文物保管工作”。
    应邀出席座谈会的中国科学院院长郭沫若，以及学术界著名人士和文物工作者们，都列举事实，有力地驳斥了右派分子的谬论。郭沫若说，共产党和人民政府十分重视文物事业。他指出，文物界的两条路线的斗争是势不两立的。我们要坚持社会主义的路线，要用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点、方法来发掘、整理、研究文物遗产，从而对人民进行社会主义、爱国主义教育，我们坚决反对少数人垄断文物、盗卖文物的半殖民地半封建路线。翦伯赞驳斥了右派分子宣传文物工作是“纯技术性”、应“与政治隔离”，纯粹是烟幕，是用来掩饰他们反对马克思列宁主义的实质。梁思成、裴文中、吴晗等都根据亲自所见的事实，驳斥了右派分子的所谓“共产党轻视文物工作”的谬论。
    文化部文物事业管理局局长王冶秋在会上讲了话。王冶秋指出，几年来党对文物事业的领导不是太多而是不够，不是要“退出”，而是要大大加强；文物事业必须走社会主义道路，过去虽然坚持了，但是很不够；走群众路线来保护文物的工作，今后也必须大力推广；在团结专家、技术人员的工作中，特别要注意加强政治、思想上的相互帮助和自我改造。
    文化部副部长张致祥也在会上讲了话。他谈到文教事业建设与国家经济建设的关系，希望文物工作者理解国家社会主义工业化是文教事业发展的物质基础，只有国家的巩固和富强，历史文物才能得到真正的保护。
