Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th – In the struggle to counterattack landlord, rich peasant elements, and counter-revolutionaries, Min County, Gansu Province, universally conducted reassessments based on their various performances after joining the cooperatives. These reassessments involved both advancements and demotions. The illegal elements among them were all classified as Category Three (i.e., under supervised production), while those who performed well were classified as Category One (i.e., formal members) and Category Two (i.e., probationary members). Those promoted from Category Three to Category One had their original labels removed, while those demoted from Category One to Category Three were given their original labels back.

Min County has a total of 2,200 landlord and rich peasant households. During the advanced cooperative movement in the county last winter and this spring, all landlords and rich peasants residing in rural areas joined the cooperatives and were subject to supervision and transformation by the cooperatives. At the time of joining, assessments were conducted on the landlords and rich peasants. Over the past six months or so, about 60% of these landlord, rich peasant elements, and counter-revolutionaries who joined the cooperatives have been able to work and abide by the law under the supervision of the vast number of cooperative members, expressing their willingness to thoroughly transform themselves. However, the remaining 40% have performed extremely poorly, resisting transformation. Their illegal behaviors are manifested in these five aspects: 1. Refusing to hand over public grain from last year, refusing to sell surplus grain, engaging in speculation and profiteering, and undermining the state's market management policies. 2. Not obeying the unified allocation within the cooperative, not observing labor discipline, and not participating in labor within the cooperative. 3. Refusing to pay investment funds to the cooperative, stealing public trees, stealing and slaughtering sheep belonging to the cooperative, and resisting the incorporation of water mills into the cooperative. 4. Spreading rumors and sabotage, inciting backward cooperative members to make trouble and demand grain, fantasizing about a change of regime, and engaging in settling accounts. 5. Sowing discord within the cooperative and colluding with individual backward elements to embezzle public property of the cooperative.

These acts of resisting transformation aroused the resentment of the vast number of peasants, who demanded that they be punished and their "cocked-up tail" behavior be stopped. The Min County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Min County People's Committee accepted the demands of the masses. On the one hand, they organized the broad masses to struggle against 105 lawless elements with serious offenses throughout the county and arrested one person in accordance with the law. At the same time, they re-ranked all landlord and rich peasant elements and counter-revolutionaries in the county and reassessed them based on their performance.

The results of the reassessment struck a blow to the arrogance of these bad elements. Now, these people no longer say, "Our labels have been removed, we are as high as you (referring to cooperative members), we are not afraid of you anymore." Nor do they "cock up their tails" anymore. They say they will honestly accept transformation. Rich peasant element Hou Ronglin immediately paid off the 372 jin of public grain and 45 yuan of investment funds owed after the reassessment.

Secondly, it also pointed out a way out for these people. After various places reassessed some of the better-performing landlord, rich peasant elements, and counter-revolutionaries from supervised production or probationary members to formal members, landlord Chen Baolin said, "The only right path for landlords and rich peasants is to work hard. Anyone who talks nonsense or acts recklessly will only bring misfortune upon themselves."

The broad masses of peasants received a profound class education in this reassessment. Landlord element Lü Zhonghe usually pretended to be active, and some peasants thought he was not bad. During this reassessment, someone revealed that he was in arrears with the cooperative's investment funds and sold grain on the black market, and the peasants then recognized his true exploitative face. Due to the increase in class consciousness, no cooperative members in this county are now making trouble to withdraw from the cooperative. The peasants also purged some landlord and rich peasant elements who had sneaked into the ranks of cooperative cadres.

### 把他们翘起来的“尾巴”压下去  岷县重新评审入社的地主、富农和反革命分子

    把他们翘起来的“尾巴”压下去
    岷县重新评审入社的地主、富农和反革命分子
    据新华社兰州8日电　甘肃省岷县在反击地主、富农分子和反革命分子的斗争中，根据他们在入社后的各种表现，普遍地进行了重新评审。这次评审中有升、有降，对其中的不法分子，都评为第三类（即管制生产），表现好的，分别评为第一类（即正式社员）和第二类（即候补社员）。由第三类上升为第一类的都摘掉了原来的帽子，从第一类下降为第三类的都给戴上了原来的帽子。
    岷县共有地主、富农二千二百户。在去冬今春，这个县高级合作化运动中，凡是家居农村的地主、富农都入了社，由社进行监督改造。入社时，曾对地主、富农进行了评审。这些入社的地主、富农分子和反革命分子，半年多来约有60％在广大社员的监督下，能够劳动守法，表示愿意彻底改造自己。但仍有40％的人表现极为不好，抗拒改造。他们的不法行为表现在这五个方面：一、抗交去年的公粮，不卖余粮，投机倒把，破坏国家市场管理的政策。二、不服从社内统一调配，不遵守劳动纪律，不参加社内劳动。三、抗交社内投资款，偷砍公树，偷宰社内羊只，抵抗水磨入社。四、造谣破坏，煽动落后社员闹事、要粮，幻想变天，进行倒算。五、挑拨社内团结，并和个别落后分子贪污社内公共财物。
    这些抗拒改造行为，激起了广大农民的愤恨，纷纷要求惩办他们，制止他们的“翘尾巴”行为。中共岷县县委和岷县人民委员会接受群众的要求，一方面组织广大群众在全县范围内斗争了情节严重的不法分子一百零五人，并依法逮捕了一人；同时将全县地主、富农分子和反革命分子重新排队，根据他们的表现重新评审。
    评审的结果，打击了这些坏分子的嚣张气焰。现在，这些人不再说“我们的帽子摘掉了，我们和你们（指社员）一般高了，我们不怕你们了。”也不再“翘尾巴”了。他们表示要规规矩矩接受改造。富农分子后荣林在评审后立即将拖欠的三百七十二斤公粮和投资款四十五元交清。
    其次也给这些人指出了出路。这次各地将表现较好的一些地主、富农分子和反革命分子从管制生产或候补社员评审为正式社员后，地主陈宝林说：“地主、富农只有好好劳动才是正路，谁要乱说乱动，只有自己倒霉。”
    广大农民在这次评审中受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。地主分子吕中和，平时伪装积极，有些农民认为他不错，这次评审中有人揭露他拖欠社内投资款，并在黑市上出卖了粮食，农民才认清了他的剥削的真面目。由于阶级觉悟提高，这个县现在没有一户社员闹退社。农民们还把一些混入社干部队伍中的地主富农分子也清洗出去。
