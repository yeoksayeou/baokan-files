Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 31st. Since its completion, the Fozi岭 Reservoir has achieved remarkable benefits in flood control, power generation, and navigation over the past three years. This fact has shattered the slanderous remarks of Cheng Shifan, a bourgeois rightist in the scientific community of Anhui Province, who viciously attacked the Huai River project, saying that "the Fozi嶺 Reservoir's arch dam is nonsense."

The Fozi岭 Reservoir project was completed in 1954. In July of that year, it encountered a major flood. At that time, the inflow from the upper reaches of the Pi River reached 6,000 cubic meters per second. After being controlled by the reservoir, the outflow was reduced to 600 cubic meters per second. In 1956, another major flood occurred, with the maximum inflow to the reservoir reaching 7,400 cubic meters per second, but the outflow controlled by the reservoir was only 1,300 cubic meters per second. During these two major floods, the Fozi嶺 Reservoir not only protected more than 700,000 mu of farmland in the lower reaches of the Pi River from disaster but also greatly reduced the burden on the main stream of the Huai River during the flood season. In May of this year, just as the wheat was ripening, the upper reaches of the Fozi嶺 Reservoir area experienced three consecutive days of heavy rain, with a total flood volume of 104 million cubic meters. However, the fierce flood was again blocked by the arch dam, protecting the wheat on both sides of the Pi River from disaster, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest.

Since the completion of the Fozi嶺 Reservoir, the reservoir's hydropower station has begun generating electricity. The electricity generated by the Fozi嶺 Hydropower Station now not only supplies the nearby Mozitan Reservoir construction site but is also transmitted to Hefei City via high-voltage lines to meet the needs of industrial production. In the past year, from August of last year to the present, the Fozi嶺 Hydropower Station has sent more than 25.31 million kilowatt-hours of electricity to Hefei. The low cost of hydropower generation brings huge benefits to the country.

With the completion of the reservoir, there have also been tremendous changes in the Pi River's navigation. In the past, during the dry season, even bamboo rafts could hardly pass through the 190+ li waterway from Liu'an to Zhengyangguan in the lower reaches of the Pi River. Now, thanks to the reservoir's year-round regulation of the Pi River's water volume, this waterway has become navigable all year round.

The rightist Cheng Shifan spread rumors, saying: "Several million mu of farmland in the upper reaches of the Fozi嶺 Reservoir have been flooded, and I don't know how many people have been left homeless." In fact, the reservoir's submerged area is only more than 11,000 mu, of which more than 2,400 mu are mountain valley land. And since the completion of the reservoir, more than 700,000 mu of farmland in the lower reaches of the Pi River have benefited year-round. The government has made proper arrangements for the 2,059 peasant households that needed to be relocated from the flood storage area. The government has provided a total of more than 710,000 yuan in subsidies for resettlement and has specifically helped the relocated people build 5,234 new houses. Tang Yehe, a relocated resident, wrote a couplet on the door of his new house to thank the government for its help. The couplet said: "Demolishing the old house and building a new one, every room is plentiful; Thanks to the government's care, everything is well-rounded."

### 右派分子的谰言不攻自破  佛子岭水库效益显著

    右派分子的谰言不攻自破
    佛子岭水库效益显著
    据新华社合肥31日电  佛子岭水库建成以后，三年来在防洪、发电、航运等方面获得了显著的效益。这一事实，粉碎了安徽省科学界的资产阶级右派分子程士范恶毒攻击治淮工程，说“佛子岭水库的连拱坝是胡闹”的谰言。
    佛子岭水库工程是1954年完成的。当年7月份就遇到大洪水。当时渒河上游来水量达六千秒公方，经过水库控制，下泄量降低到六百秒公方。1956年也遇到大洪水，水库上游最大来水量有七千四百秒公方，经水库控制，下放的流量却只有一千三百秒公方。这两次大洪水期间，佛子岭水库不但保障了渒河下游七十多万亩农田免受灾害，还大大减轻了淮河干流在汛期的负担。今年5月间，正当小麦成熟的时候，佛子岭水库上游地区连续降了三天暴雨，洪水总量达一亿零四百万公方，但凶猛的洪水又被连拱坝挡住了，保住了渒河两岸的小麦没有受灾，出现了历年未有的丰收。
    佛子岭水库建成以后，水库的水电站就开始发电。佛子岭水电站现在发出的电力，不仅供应附近的磨子潭水库工地，还用高压线远送到合肥市，供应工业生产的需要。从去年8月份到现在的一年中，佛子岭水电站送到合肥的电就有二千五百三十一万多度。水力发电的成本低廉，这给国家带来巨大利益。
    随着水库的建成，渒河航运也有了巨大的变化。过去渒河下游六安至正阳关一百九十多华里航程，每逢枯水季节，连竹筏也难通行。如今由于水库常年调剂渒河水量，已经使得这段航道终年通航。
    右派分子程士范造谣说：“佛子岭水库上游有几千万亩农田被淹了，不知有多少老百姓无家可归”。事实上水库淹没区只有一万一千多亩，其中还有二千四百多亩是山冲地。而水库建成以后，仅仅渒河下游常年受益的农田就有七十多万亩。蓄洪区需要迁移的二千零五十九户农民，政府对他们都作了妥善安置。为了移民，政府拿出的各项补助经费即达七十一万多元，还具体帮助移民新建房屋五千二百三十四间。移民汤叶和在迁移以后，曾在新房门上写了一副对联感谢政府的帮助。对联说：“拆旧房盖新房间间不少；蒙政府多照顾样样周全”。
