According to a report in the Chongqing Daily: Since the start of the anti-rightist struggle, leading cadres from the Party and trade union organizations in various industrial, capital construction, and transportation enterprises in Chongqing have made multiple reports to workers and their families, repeatedly explaining key issues such as the "struggle situation," "the fundamental differences between us and the rightists," and "the tasks of the working class in the face of this struggle." They also convened various symposiums, discussion meetings, and debates to refute the words and deeds of the rightists and launch a great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. In some of the better-performing units, more than 90% of the workers received education. The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's trade union organized an anti-rightist struggle propaganda evening party with 30,000 participants. Through the "Hall of Monsters and Demons Made Visible," it introduced the anti-Party and anti-socialist speeches and the evil activities of the rightists in the unit to the masses, arousing great resentment. Some workshops of the company also organized the masses to visit workers' residential areas and other places to refute the lies of the rightists, such as "housing is a mess" and "living conditions have not improved," with ironclad facts. The Public Transportation Company's trade union held a photo exhibition on the anti-rightist struggle, with veteran workers serving as narrators, giving the company's employees a vivid lesson.

During more than two months of propaganda and education, many workers consciously linked their thoughts and engaged in self-criticism. A seaman, He Bingliu, said: "The rightists like to make trouble the most. I will not be fooled again." In many units, labor discipline has been greatly consolidated compared to the past, and some people who used to be absent from work, disobedient to assignments, and unsettled in their jobs have now corrected their mistakes. Through this debate, many workers have abandoned excessively high and urgent demands on their lives. Some apprentices in the Iron and Steel Company used to have opinions about extending the apprenticeship period and wage treatment. Now, they warmly support the decision of the State Council, concentrate on learning technology, and express their determination to strive to become outstanding apprentices in the competition. In order to reduce the burden on the state, workers have voluntarily suggested using mass fundraising to build houses, and there have been many new instances of unity and mutual assistance in which people voluntarily give up their houses to comrades in need.

The Party and trade union organizations pay attention to guiding the high political enthusiasm of the workers to production at any time. The competitions in many enterprises have become more active, and a large number of advanced units and advanced producers have emerged. Production tasks have been completed better than in the past.

    展开两条道路大辩论
    重庆市职工政治觉悟提高生产热情高涨
    本报讯　据重庆日报报道：从反右派斗争开始以来，重庆市工业、基本建设、交通运输业的各个企业党和工会组织的负责干部向职工和家属作了多次报告，反复地讲解了“斗争形势”、“我们和右派分子的根本分歧”、“在这场斗争面前工人阶级的任务”等几个主要问题，并召开了各种座谈会、讨论会和辩论会等，对右派分子的言行进行驳斥，展开了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论。在一些工作较好的单位，90％以上的职工受到了教育。重庆钢铁公司工会组织了有三万人次参加的反右派斗争宣传晚会，通过“牛鬼蛇神现形馆”，把本单位右派分子的反党反社会主义言论及其罪恶活动介绍给群众，激起了大家的愤恨。这个公司的一些车间还组织群众到职工住宅区等地去参观，以铁的事实驳倒右派分子所谓“房屋一团糟”“生活没有改善”等谎言。公共交通公司工会举办了反右派斗争的图片展览会，并且由老工人担任解说员，给公司职工上了一堂生动的课。
    在两个多月的宣传教育中，许多工人自觉地联系思想进行了自我批评。海员工人何炳六说：“右派分子最喜欢闹事的，我不再上当了”。许多单位劳动纪律比过去大为巩固，一些过去旷工、不服从调配、不安心工作的人，现在也纠正了错误。许多工人通过这场辩论，放弃了生活上过高过急的要求。钢铁公司的一些学工过去对延长学徒学习期限和工资待遇有意见，现在他们热烈拥护国务院的决定，安心学习技术，表示要在竞赛中争取成为优秀学工；工人们为了减轻国家负担，自动建议用群众集资的办法来兴建住宅，并且出现了许多自动让屋给有困难的同志住的团结友爱的新气象。
    党和工会组织注意随时把职工高涨的政治热情引导到生产上去。许多企业的竞赛活跃了，涌现了大量的先进单位和先进生产者，生产任务都比过去完成得好。
