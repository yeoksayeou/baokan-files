Xu Baokui is a Veteran Rightist and Anti-Communist Old Hand

　　This newspaper reports that the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) has continuously held meetings to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Xu Baokui, a member of the RCCK Central Committee, a standing member of the RCCK Beijing Municipal Committee, and its acting secretary-general.

　　According to the revelations at the meeting, as early as 1949, Xu Baokui openly clamored for taking turns with the Communist Party in "sitting in the government." In the eight years since liberation, in order to conspire to realize his political ambitions, he has been waiting for an opportunity to move. After the Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" last year, Xu said triumphantly: "Mutual supervision, first of all, is to supervise the Communist Party and prevent (the Communist Party) from being arbitrary." He advocated that the RCCK should establish organizations extensively in small and medium-sized cities across the country, first seize positions in small and medium-sized cities, saying that "the United Front Work Departments in small and medium-sized cities are weak, and the CPPCC is also unsound." After the Hungarian incident last year, Xu believed that the time was ripe, recruited troops and bought horses everywhere, and triumphantly publicized: "The title of the leading party should be considered later."

　　In April and May of this year, Chen Mingshu wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of people's representatives and CPPCC members' inspection to go to Guangzhou to conduct a so-called investigation on the issue of intellectuals. When Chen was temporarily unable to go, Xu Baokui stepped forward. After Xu arrived in Guangzhou, he specifically looked for social intellectuals, former military and political personnel, counter-revolutionaries who had been struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and people under surveillance who were dissatisfied with the Party. On the one hand, he incited and fanned the flames, collecting anti-Party "materials"; on the other hand, he redressed "grievances" and cried "injustice" for them, and fabricated "materials" such as "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries at Sun Yat-sen University was completely wrong." Then he ran to Zhejiang and provided these "materials" to Ma Wanche, a rightist element of the RCCK Zhejiang Provincial Committee, who used them to launch a large-scale attack on the Party at the Zhejiang Provincial CPPCC meeting.

　　When the people of the whole country had launched a counterattack against the rampant attacks of the rightists, Xu continued to summon grassroots leaders of the RCCK from June 13th to 18th, held seven briefing sessions, and continued to call on the grassroots to lead the "great blooming and contending" to a "new climax"; at the same time, Xu Baokui also incited social figures (mostly former military and political personnel) connected with the RCCK to make "great democracy." A social figure branch of the RCCK took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to distribute a reactionary document inciting trouble. The RCCK Standing Committee had already decided not to print and distribute it, but Xu repeatedly insisted on printing and distributing it on behalf of the RCCK Municipal Committee. This document frantically clamored: "The Hungarian incident is about to break out in China," and said, "The employment and relief problem of social figures objectively exists. If we (the RCCK) cannot solve it, it will be easier to solve if we let them make trouble."

　　Xu Baokui's consistent anti-communism and anti-people is inseparable from his ugly history. When Xu was studying at Yenching University, he was appreciated by the traitor Zhang Dongsun and became one of the "dragon, tiger, and dog" generals under Zhang. First, he followed Zhang to Guangdong to join the warlord Chen Jitang, and later went to Beijing to become the section chief of Song Zheyuan's puppet Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he became a general of Wang Kemin's traitor group. After the Japanese invasion of China, he became the confidential secretary of the big traitor Wang Kemin and colluded with big traitors Zhou Fohai, Yin Tong, Zhang Yanqing, and others. When the Japanese invaders were about to collapse, he went to Chongqing twice to establish contact with Dai Li, the head of the Kuomintang secret service. Subsequently, he accepted the mission of Stuart Leideng, the head of the American imperialist invasion of China, and conspired with international spy Wang Pengsheng to establish a radio station. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Xu and Zhang Dongsun took the money of American spy Wang Zhiqi to run the "Zheng Bao" in Beijing, with Xu as the editor-in-chief. In October 1945, Xu wrote a reactionary "editorial" titled "Longevity of Nanshan," flattering Chiang Kai-shek, saying that Chiang Kai-shek's "great achievements are obvious and will not be diminished in the slightest by the slander of deep wording and over-interpretation," and praised Chiang Kai-shek as "born for the country and regarded by the people as a god."

### 一贯依附反动派仇恨共产党  许宝骙是右派宿将反共老手

　　一贯依附反动派仇恨共产党
　　许宝骙是右派宿将反共老手
    本报讯　民革北京市委会连续召开大会，揭发和批判民革中央委员、民革北京市委常委、代理秘书长许宝骙的反动言行。
    据会上揭露，许宝骙在1949年即公开叫嚣要和共产党“轮流坐庄”。解放八年来，为阴谋实现他的政治野心，他一直在伺机欲动。去年党提出“长期共存、互相监督”方针后，许得意地说：“互相监督，首先是监督共产党，防止（共产党）专断”。他主张民革要在全国中小城市普遍建立组织，首先在中小城市夺取阵地，说“中小城市统战部较薄弱，政协也不健全”。在去年匈牙利事件发生后，许认为时机成熟，到处招兵买马，并得意洋洋地公开宣扬说：“以后领导党的称号应该考虑了”。
    今年4、5月间，陈铭枢想趁人民代表和政协委员视察的机会，去广州进行所谓知识分子问题的调查，陈临时有事不能去，许宝骙就挺身而出。许到广州后，专门找对党不满的社会知识分子、旧军政人员、肃反被斗分子和被管制分子，一方面向他们进行煽风、点火，搜集反党“材料”；一方面为他们伸
  “冤”叫“屈”，还捏造了“中山大学肃反全部搞错”的“材料”。然后跑到浙江，把这些“材料”提供给民革浙江省委右派分子马文车，马就拿来在浙江省政协会上向党大肆攻击。
    当全国人民已向右派分子的猖狂进攻展开反击时，许在6月13日至18日还连续召集民革基层负责人，开了七次汇报会，继续号召基层要把“大鸣大放”引向“新的高潮”；同时，许宝骙还煽动民革联系的社会人士（多系旧军政人员）起来闹“大民主”。民革一个社会人士支部趁着共产党整风要散发一个煽动闹事的反动文件，民革常委会已经决议不准印发，而许却一再坚持要以民革市委名义代为印发。这个文件中疯狂叫嚣：“匈牙利事件在中国一触即发”，并说“社会人士的就业救济问题是客观存在，我们（民革）不能解决，让他们闹起来才好解决”。
    许宝骙一贯反共反人民是和他的丑恶历史分不开的。许在燕京大学读书时，就得到叛国罪犯张东荪的赏识，成为张门下“龙、虎、狗”三将之一，先是随张去广东投靠军阀陈济棠，后来到北京做了宋哲元伪冀察政委会的科长，抗战前就成了王克敏汉奸集团的一员大将。日本侵华后，又当上了大汉奸王克敏的机要秘书，并和大汉奸周佛海、殷同、张燕卿等勾结。日本侵略者即将垮台时，他又两度去重庆，和国民党特务头子戴笠建立联系，随后又接受美帝侵华头子司徒雷登的使命，与国际特务王芃生密谋建立电台。抗日战争胜利后，许又和张东荪拿美国特务王志其的钱在北京办“正报”，许当总编辑。1945年10月许写了一篇题为“南山之寿”反动透顶的“社论”，向蒋介石献媚，说蒋介石“丰功伟绩，昭然若揭，不因深文周纳之诽谤而有丝毫之减损”，并狂捧蒋介石是“天生以为社稷，人望之如神仙”。
