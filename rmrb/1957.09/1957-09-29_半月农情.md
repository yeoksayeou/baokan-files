    Half-Monthly Agricultural Situation
    White Dew (September 8th) – Autumnal Equinox (September 23rd)

    The autumn harvest in northern regions has entered a tense stage during this period. In Shandong Province, the early autumn crops have been completely harvested. In Hebei Province, more than half of the spring-sown crops such as corn, sorghum, and millet have been harvested in the southern regions, and one-quarter to one-third have been harvested in the northern regions. The Northeast and Northwest regions, where the season is later, have also begun harvesting. During the autumn harvest, many agricultural cooperatives in various regions have formulated autumn harvest plans and autumn protection agreements. Some regions have also implemented methods such as contracting work to small groups or organizing specialized harvest teams to ensure that the autumn harvest work is carried out quickly and in an orderly manner. Most areas have paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain is brought home, thereby increasing the yield of autumn fields.

    While harvesting, the winter wheat sowing work in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and Gansu provinces has gradually begun. In the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi, more than 986,000 mu of wheat planted after the previous crop have been completely sown, and 1,350,000 mu of wheat planted after a fallow period are being sown intensively. In the Changwei Special District of Shandong, more than 20% of the wheat fields have been sown, and in counties with faster progress, the sown wheat accounts for 30%-60% of the cultivated land area. Before sowing, the above-mentioned regions generally paid attention to preparatory work such as plowing during the fallow period, preparing the land, accumulating fertilizer, selecting seeds, drying seeds, and repairing farm tools. During sowing, areas threatened by drought also relied on the collective strength of the cooperatives to fully utilize various water sources to carry out drought-resistant sowing, so that drought-affected wheat fields could also be sown in a timely manner.

    South of the Yangtze River, a bumper late rice harvest is in sight. The 39 million mu of late rice in Guangdong Province are growing vigorously, which is rare in recent years. The 17 million mu of late rice in the Yangtze River Delta are growing with strong stems and leaves, and are currently heading and flowering. According to estimates by relevant departments, in southern Jiangsu, where double-cropping rice and wheat are the main harvests, the average yield of late rice per mu will increase by 10% to 15% compared to last year (500 jin). At present, farmers in various rice-producing areas are actively top-dressing, controlling pests, weeding, and irrigating, striving for a full harvest of late rice.

    半月农情
    白露（9月8日）——秋分（9月23日）
    北方各地的秋收在这个时期进入紧张阶段。山东省的早秋作物，已经收割完毕；河北省的玉米、高粱、谷子等春播作物，南部地区收割了一半以上，北部地区收割了四分之一到三分之一；季节较晚的东北、西北地区，也已经开始收割。在秋收中，各地有不少农业社制订了秋收计划和护秋公约，有的地区还推行了小组包工或组织专业队收秋的办法，保证了秋收工作有秩序地迅速进行。大部地区都注意了精收细打、颗粒还家，从而提高了秋田的收获量。
    在秋收的同时，河北、山西、山东、河南、陕西、新疆、甘肃等省的冬小麦播种工作已逐渐展开。山西长治专区的九十八万六千多亩正茬小麦已经全部种完，一百三十五万亩回茬小麦正在进行紧张播种；山东昌潍专区的麦田已下种20％以上，进度较快一些的县，已播小麦占耕地面积的30％—60％。上述各地在播种以前，一般都注意了伏耕、整地、积肥、选种、晒种和补修农具等准备工作；在播种中，遭受干旱威胁的地区，还依靠合作社的集体力量，充分利用了各种水源，进行抗旱播种，使受旱的麦田也能适时下种。
    长江以南地区，晚稻丰收在望。广东省的三千九百万亩晚稻生长旺盛，为近几年来所罕有；长江三角洲的一千七百多万亩晚稻，长得茎叶健壮，目前正在抽穗扬花。据有关部门估计，以稻麦两熟为主要收获物的江苏南部地区，晚稻平均每亩产量将比去年（五百斤）增产一成到一成半。目前，各水稻产区的农民，正在积极追肥、治虫、耘田、灌溉，力争晚稻有十足的收成。
