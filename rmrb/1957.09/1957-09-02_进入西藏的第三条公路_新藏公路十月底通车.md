Urumqi Dispatch, September 1st: The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, which runs through the western border of the motherland, is in its final phase of construction after more than a year of intense effort. It is expected to open to traffic by the end of October this year. This is the third highway into Tibet, following the Sichuan-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet Highways.

The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway starts in Yecheng, in the southern Tarim Basin of Xinjiang, and ends in Gar County in the Ali region of Tibet, with a total length of more than 1,200 kilometers. The highway departs from Yecheng, crosses more than 100 kilometers of desert, follows the Halashtang River into the Karakoram Mountains, crosses five peaks with altitudes of 4,000 to 5,000 meters, and then enters the Ali region, following an 800-kilometer temporary road to reach Gar County.

Construction of this highway began in March 1956. Due to the complex terrain, thin air, and fluctuating climate of the Karakoram Mountains, the workers and soldiers undertaking the road construction task waged an arduous struggle against the threat of altitude sickness and severe cold of minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius.

The Ali region is located in a remote border area, with an average altitude of more than 4,000 meters, and transportation is very inconvenient. Most of the supplies needed locally are supplied by Xinjiang and Lhasa. However, the mountain roads from Xinjiang to Ali are rugged and dangerous, and can only be transported by camels and donkeys, requiring four to five months for a round trip. At the same time, due to heavy snow blocking the mountains in winter and spring, transportation can only be carried out once a year. After the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway is opened to traffic, the supply of materials and the round trip of passengers will be greatly facilitated. Gar County's famous wool can also be transported and sold to the mainland. (Attached picture)

### 进入西藏的第三条公路  新藏公路十月底通车

    进入西藏的第三条公路
    新藏公路十月底通车
    本报乌鲁木齐1日电  贯通祖国西陲的新（新疆）藏（西藏）公路，经过一年多的紧张施工，已经进入最后一期工程，预计到今年10月底就要通车了。这是继康藏、青藏公路修通后，进入西藏的第三条公路。
    新藏公路北起新疆塔里木盆地南部的叶城，南至西藏阿里地区的噶大克，全长一千二百多公里。公路从叶城出发，穿过一百多公里的戈壁，沿着哈拉斯塘河进入喀喇昆仑山，翻过五座海拔四、五千公尺的高峰，然后进入阿里地区，循着八百公里的便道，抵达噶大克。
    这条公路是1956年3月开始修建的。由于喀喇昆仑山地形复杂，空气稀薄，气候变化多端，承担筑路任务的工人和战士们，曾经同高山病的威胁和零下三、四十度的严寒，进行了艰苦的斗争。
    阿里地区僻处边陲，海拔平均四千多公尺，交通很不方便。当地所需要的物资，大都由新疆和拉萨供应。但是，新疆到阿里，山路崎岖险峻，只能用骆驼和毛驴驮运，来回一趟，需要四、五个月。同时，由于冬春两季，大雪封山，每年仅能驮运一次。新藏公路通车以后，物资供应和旅客往返将较前大为方便。噶大克著名的羊毛也能运销内地。（附图片）
