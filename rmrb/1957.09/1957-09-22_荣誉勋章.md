    Medal of Honor
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yang Kexian
    On the evening of the 18th, Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, Kazansky, presented a "Medal of Honor" on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to Chinese geologist Nie Yinchu, commending his heroic act of risking crossing the Ertysh River to escort a seriously ill Soviet female geological engineer.
    On August 25, 1956, Nie Yinchu and other Chinese and Soviet geological personnel working at the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Geological Bureau escorted Soviet geologist Stepanova to the airport. Stepanova's geological survey team was working in a sparsely populated deep mountain area in the western Altai Mountains. One day, Stepanova suddenly suffered from acute appendicitis. Although the doctor performed surgery at the time, considering the drastic changes in the field climate, it was predicted that it would be difficult for the patient to escape danger. Therefore, three days after the surgery, it was decided to let her fly to Urumqi for recuperation.
    It was one hundred and dozens of kilometers from the geological survey team's worksite to the airport, and the mountain road was rugged and difficult to travel. Nie Yinchu and others spread thick fine grass, leather coats, and blankets under the patient. When encountering bumpy wooden bridges, they carried the patient across the bridge on a stretcher. Sometimes they rushed ahead of the car to level the uneven road surface so that the car could drive smoothly. At midnight, they arrived at the bank of the Ertysh River, but found that the ferries were moored on the opposite bank of the river.
    The Ertysh River is the largest river in the Altai Mountains, and the water is treacherous. The Uygur boatmen who ferried across the river for half their lives did not dare to ferry at night and stopped ferrying every day at dusk to rest. At this midnight, they were already fast asleep. No matter how much they shouted until they were hoarse, shone the car lights non-stop, and even fired guns to call for help, the noisy river and whistling cold wind covered up the sounds, failing to disturb the sleeping people on the opposite bank.
    The situation was very urgent, and the patient was still moaning constantly. If they waited until dawn to ferry, the plane taking off at dawn would also be delayed.
    At this moment, Nie Yinchu suddenly climbed onto a steel cable spanning the river for ferrying, and pulled the steel cable to climb to the opposite bank. This steel cable was about one hundred meters long, and it was very difficult to advance one meter. As soon as he let go, he would fall into the river. At this time, he stepped on an iron ring hanging on the steel cable. Because his arms were tired and he was out of breath, he had to use his armpits to clamp the steel cable to rest for a while, and then continue to move forward. The closer he got to the center of the river, the closer the steel cable was to the river water, and half of his body was already in the icy and bone-chilling rapid river water. His body was swaying and hanging obliquely on the steel cable, swept by the rapid current. At this time, his gloves were already worn through, and his palms were covered with blood stains from being rubbed by the steel cable.
    After passing the center of the river, the steel cable sloped upwards, making climbing even more difficult. Later, his armpits were also covered in blood stains, and the hanging iron ring was also worn down a deep groove by the steel cable and was about to break, but he did not pay attention to these life-and-death dangers. He had only one belief: to climb over alive, rock the boat over, get the patient to the opposite bank, and send her to the plane in time and safely.
    "Comrades! I've crossed the river!" He used all his strength to finally reach the opposite bank, telling all the geological personnel anxiously waiting on the shore this victorious news. The boat came over, and Stepanova was delivered to the airport safely and on time. Her pale and sallow face showed a smile as she laboriously waved to Nie Yinchu to express her gratitude. Later, her illness was cured in Urumqi.
    This 21-year-old Nie Yinchu, a Communist Party member from Taoyuan County, Hunan Province, the son of a poor peasant, who risked his life to rescue the Soviet female expert and won the "Medal of Honor" from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, used to herd cattle and work as a short-term worker when he was a child. He joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at the age of sixteen, served as a communications soldier, and received two Third-Class Merits on the Korean front. Now he is a collector for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Geological Survey Team and has just returned to Urumqi from the Kunlun Mountains.
    Nie Yinchu's heroic deeds have been widely published in Soviet newspapers. Since last year, he has received many congratulatory letters from Soviet friends, including scholars, professors, lecturers, and ordinary Soviet workers. In a joint letter from Moscow signed by sixteen people headed by Rushakov, Chairman of the State Examination Committee and Doctor of Agronomy, they praised Nie Yinchu's high humanitarianism and touching determination, and congratulated Nie Yinchu on "winning the Medal of Honor awarded by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, which he deserved."

    荣誉勋章
    新华社记者　杨克现
    18日晚间，苏联驻乌鲁木齐总领事卡赞斯基代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团把一枚“荣誉勋章”授给我国地质人员聂银初，嘉奖他险渡额尔齐斯河护送患重病的苏联女地质工程师的英雄行为。
    1956年8月25日，聂银初和新疆维吾尔自治区地质局工作的其他几位中苏地质人员一起，护送苏联女地质专家斯捷潘诺娃到飞机场去。斯捷潘诺娃所在的这支地质调查队工作在阿尔泰山西部一个人烟稀少的深山里。一天，斯捷潘诺娃突患急性盲肠炎，当时医生虽然动了手术，但根据野外气候变化剧烈，预料病人很难脱离险境，因此在动手术三天后，决定让她乘飞机到乌鲁木齐去休养。
    从地质调查队的工地到飞机场共有一百几十公里，山路崎岖难行。聂银初等人就为病人身下铺上厚厚的细草和皮大衣、毛毯。遇到坎坷不平的木桥时，他们就用担架抬着病人过桥，有时他们还赶到汽车前面。把不平的路面修平，让汽车平稳地行驶过去。到半夜的时候，他们来到了额尔齐斯河畔，但是发现渡河的船都停泊在这条河的对岸。
    额尔齐斯河是阿尔泰山区最大的河流，水势险恶。摆渡的维吾尔族船翁虽半辈子生活在这条河上，但都不敢在夜间摆渡，每天一到黄昏便停渡休息。此刻半夜，他们早已熟睡了。任凭这边叫哑了声音，用汽车灯光不停地照射，甚至鸣枪告急，但是喧闹的河水和呼哨的寒风把声音掩盖住了，惊动不了对岸熟睡的人们。
    情况非常紧急，病人仍在不断呻吟，如果等到天亮摆渡，黎明时起飞的飞机也会耽误。
    就在这时候，聂银初忽然攀上了一条横跨河身供摆渡用的钢丝绳，手拉着钢丝向对岸攀去。这条钢丝绳约有一百公尺长，每前进一公尺都很困难，只要一松手就会掉到河中去。这时候他脚下蹬了一个吊在钢丝绳上的铁丝环，由于手累气喘，要用两支胳肢窠夹着钢丝稍微休息一下，接着又继续前进。越到河心，那条钢丝绳越近河水，他半个身子已经进入冰彻入骨的急湍的河水中。他的身体被急流冲得晃晃荡荡，斜挂在钢丝绳上。这时他的手套早已磨破，手心被钢丝磨得满是血渍。
    过了河中心，钢丝绳斜斜上升，攀缘更加困难。到后来，他的胳肢窠也是血渍渍的了，吊着的铁丝环也被钢丝磨下去一个深深的槽，快要断了，但他并没有注意这些生死攸关的危险。他只有一个信念，活着攀过去，把船摇过来，把病人接到对岸，及时地安全地把她送上飞机。
    “同志们！我已经过了河了！”他用尽平生力气，终于到达了对岸，把这一胜利的消息，告诉岸上焦急等待着的所有地质人员。船开过来了，斯捷潘诺娃及时地安全地被送到飞机场，上了飞机，她的惨白蜡黄的脸孔露出了笑容，向聂银初吃力地招手致谢。后来，她的病在乌鲁木齐调养痊愈了。
    这位冒险抢救苏联女专家、荣获苏联最高苏维埃“荣誉勋章”的聂银初，今年二十一岁，是湖南桃源县人，贫农的儿子，共产党员。他小时放过牛，打过短工，他十六岁时加入了中国人民志愿军，当通讯员，在朝鲜前线立过两次三等功。现在他是新疆维吾尔自治区地质普查队的采集员，最近刚刚从昆仑山上回到乌鲁木齐。
    聂银初的英雄事迹曾经在苏联各报纸上广泛刊载，去年以来，他收到许多苏联友人的贺信，其中有学者、教授、讲师，也有普通的苏维埃工人。一封来自莫斯科以国家考试委员会主席、农学博士鲁沙可夫为首的十六人的联名信中，赞扬了聂银初高度的人道主义的和感人心弦的决心，并祝贺聂银初“荣获了应当获得的最高苏维埃主席团奖给的荣誉勋章”。
