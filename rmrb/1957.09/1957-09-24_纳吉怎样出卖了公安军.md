    How Nagy betrayed the Public Security Forces
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    One of the biggest deceptions in the United Nations "Five-Member Committee" report on the "Hungarian Question" is the attempt to whitewash Nagy's crimes. The report depicts Nagy as not having participated in the formation of the October events, saying that Nagy had always been a prisoner of the Public Security Forces. What is the truth? It was not the Public Security Forces controlling Nagy, but Nagy tying the hands and feet of the Public Security Forces. Nagy always used the excuse of "avoiding bloodshed" and "no firing" to prevent the Public Security Forces and the Soviet army from counterattacking the counter-revolutionaries. When the counter-revolutionary armed forces were fully prepared on October 29th, Nagy openly announced the dissolution of the Public Security Forces and demanded that the Soviet army withdraw from the city of Budapest. The "Five-Member Committee" report avoids mentioning this kind of betrayal by the Nagy group, but instead slanders that no detachment of the Hungarian armed forces fought against the counter-revolutionaries alongside the Soviet Union, but stood with the rioters. It was precisely because of the Nagy group's betrayal that the armed forces defending the people's regime were hindered from exerting their due strength in the struggle to eliminate the counter-revolution.
    The following is the personal experience of Captain Barok, the political instructor of the Peji Barracks of the Public Security Forces, during the October events. From his narrative, we can see the truth about Nagy's betrayal.
    "On the evening of October 23rd last year, I had already seen what was happening on the streets of Pest, and I saw the Public Security Forces being shot at. At that time, I was at the radio station myself, and I was almost killed by armed bandits. In those days, I truly saw the soldiers' high spirit of self-sacrifice. Among us were ordinary young soldiers who had been punished several times for being undisciplined, but even these people fought bravely to the end. Some soldiers were attacked on the road, but they struggled back to the barracks with serious injuries, fatigue, and torment, and were ready to fight again.
    "On October 29th, I suddenly heard Nagy's statement announcing the dissolution of the National Public Security Forces on the radio. This statement was like a bolt from the blue, like a bomb from the sky, and shocked us all. Those who were considered counter-revolutionaries an hour ago were now suddenly called 'freedom fighters'. Everyone asked with righteous indignation: If they are 'freedom fighters', then what are we? Are we traitors? If the counter-revolutionaries are called 'national heroes', then what are we? We are Public Security members, faithfully carrying out the government's orders, but now we have all become traitors and murderers!
    "The barracks were filled with great anger. Soldiers ran to me one after another (because I was their political instructor), asking me to explain the truth to them. But what could I say to them! I myself was also in extreme confusion. Nagy's statement destroyed all my trust. At that time, our officers had put their lives aside, but we felt sorry for the soldiers, who were all children from worker and peasant families, and they never forgot their military oath until the last minute. We wanted to save them. Our superiors asked the nearby national defense army barracks for ordinary army uniforms and documents for the soldiers. The national defense army barracks initially agreed to our request, but later refused. Our soldiers immediately saw through that there were traitors there.
    "The soldiers kept coming to me with requests, asking us to explain the actual situation. They thought that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding, and they didn't believe what was happening before their eyes. 'No, the government cannot leave us, cannot abandon us, because this will be a suicidal path for the government! Aren't we the government's most steadfast and reliable protectors? Haven't we faithfully completed all the government's instructions until the last minute?' The soldiers issued a unanimous protest.
    "We elected a delegation of officers. Our general opinion was that we must strive to meet with Nagy face to face and find out the truth. That evening, our colonel officer called Nagy and asked him to receive him in the name of the Public Security Team delegation. But Nagy's answer was: 'I will not meet with you, I have no time.' The soldiers angrily declared: There are still more than six hundred of us, everyone take up arms and go to the Parliament Building and demand that Nagy negotiate with us! At this time, our colonel called Nagy again and told him the soldiers' opinions. This had an effect on Nagy. He promised to go to the Parliament Building at ten o'clock tomorrow morning, enter through Gate No. 12, and meet us there.
    "We arrived at the Parliament Building on time. Some of us were wearing civilian clothes, some had changed into ordinary military uniforms, and we were not carrying weapons. Only I accidentally left a small pistol. Because Nagy stated on the phone that weapons were not allowed. Someone was indeed waiting at the entrance and told us that Nagy could not meet us yet, and asked us to wait in the living room of the Ministry of Agriculture across from the building.
    "We had agreed with the soldiers in the barracks in advance: if we had not notified them by one o'clock in the afternoon, it meant that we had been arrested, and then the soldiers would bring weapons to the Parliament Building to rescue us. Therefore, we were very nervous every minute, but it was already eleven o'clock, and we were still sitting and waiting.
    "Suddenly the door was opened, and a fully armed group walked into the living room. This was the delegation of the 'Revolutionary Committee' of Veszprém County. Subsequently, representatives of some 'Revolutionary Committees' and 'Uprising Teams' from other regions also entered the hall, all saying that Nagy had made an appointment with them to negotiate. We couldn't understand why these armed counter-revolutionaries were also brought into the living room where we were. There were plenty of empty rooms in the Ministry of Agriculture, so this would pose a fatal threat to us. Everyone called the leader of the Veszprém County delegation 'Mr. Boss', and he asked me to explain where we came from, fearing that there might be spies from the Public Security Team among us. I replied: 'Comrade, don't be afraid, there are no spies from the Public Security Team among us.' 'What comrade! I'm sorry, I'm Mr. Manager. Please note that the title of comrade is gone forever,' he said gleefully.
    "We looked at each other, and I completely understood who I was talking to. We huddled against the wall and continued to wait. At this time, new armed groups came, arguing with each other, arguing about their different demands. Because we had no demands and no quarrels, we aroused their suspicion more and more.
    "I noticed that the atmosphere was becoming more and more wrong, but I couldn't go back empty-handed. I had to ask Nagy to clarify how he would arrange our fate. It was almost one o'clock in the afternoon, and I sent a soldier to call the barracks. The soldier returned and said that no one answered the phone in the barracks. Everyone dared not believe what had happened in the camp. At this time, someone suddenly shouted: 'These are Public Security members, get rid of them!' I immediately gave my people a look towards the window, and the four of us immediately jumped out of the window and ran quickly to the car parked not far from the window. Although the counter-revolutionaries chased out from the gate, it was too late to catch us.
    "Our car drove at full speed towards the barracks. Just as we were about to enter the yard, we suddenly saw many soldiers with torn clothes and blood all over their bodies running out onto the streets in all directions. Unrecognized bandits were standing at the gate of the yard. As soon as they saw us, they immediately shouted: 'You are also dirty Public Security soldiers!' and then reached for the gun handles. We turned around and ran away, and the sound of gunfire rang out behind us.
    "When we escaped from the danger in this way, we could not completely determine the truth of the matter. Nagy and his accomplices knew that there was a delegation of Public Security Team officers waiting for him in the living room of the Ministry of Agriculture. They took advantage of this opportunity, while there were no leaders in the barracks, to strike first and eliminate the army they already considered hateful. What a cunning conspiracy! Many of our loyal soldiers became victims of this trick!
    "We remember that after Nagy disarmed us, the Dudas gang slaughtered our soldiers everywhere on the streets, hanging them on street light poles and Soviet monuments. What was all this for? Was it because the Public Security Team was the most reliable armed force to protect the proletarian dictatorship? They fought to the last minute of their lives to protect the worker-peasant regime. The counter-revolutionaries knew this, so they wanted to track down the Public Security Forces. The traitors also knew that we were the biggest obstacle to their betrayal of the motherland, so they also wanted to eliminate us."
    The counter-revolutionaries made all kinds of slanders and defamations against the Public Security Forces, inciting the people to despise and hate them. However, these soldiers are the purest and most sincere sons and daughters of workers and peasants among the working people. They sacrificed their own happiness and young lives for the sake of defending the interests of the country and for the cause of socialism. Some of them left behind young widows and young children, and some became lifelong disabled. Shouldn't the Nagy group bear the greatest responsibility for the occurrence of this tragedy? Can the "Five-Member Committee's" report on the "Hungarian Question" wash away the Nagy group's bloody hands of crime?
    Now that the counter-revolution has been crushed and the order of life has been restored, the achievements of the officers and soldiers of the Public Security Forces in this struggle will be recognized and respected by the people of Hungary.

    纳吉怎样出卖了公安军
    本报记者　胡济邦
    联合国“五人委员会”关于“匈牙利问题”的报告中，最大的欺骗之一是要洗清纳吉的罪恶。这个报告把纳吉描写成在十月事件形成中未参加活动，说纳吉一直成为公安军的俘虏。真实的情况是怎样的呢？不是公安军管制纳吉，而是纳吉把公安军的手脚捆住了，纳吉一直借口“避免流血”“不准开火”来阻止公安军和苏军对反革命的反击。等到10月29日反革命的武装力量已完全准备妥当的时候，纳吉就公开宣布解散公安军，要求苏军撤出布达佩斯城。“五人委员会”的报告对纳吉集团的这类出卖行为避而不谈，却污蔑说匈牙利武装力量没有一个支队同苏联一起对反革命作战，而是和暴乱者站在一边。正是由于纳吉集团的出卖行为，阻碍了保卫人民政权的武装在消灭反革命的斗争中发挥它应有的力量。
    下面是公安部队培吉兵营的政治指导员巴罗克上尉在十月事件中的亲身经历，从他这段回忆的叙述中可以看出纳吉出卖行为的真相。
    “我在去年10月23日的晚上已经看到在佩斯街上发生的事情，看到公安军被射击，当时我自己在广播电台，几乎被武装匪徒们送了我的命。我在这些日子里才真实地看到了士兵们的高度自我牺牲的精神，我们之中也有受过几次处分的不守纪律的普通青年兵，连这些人也同样英勇地战斗到底。有的士兵在路上受到攻击，但是他带着重伤、疲乏和折磨终于争扎着回到兵营，而且再次准备参加战斗。
    “10月29日那天，我忽然从广播中听到纳吉宣布解散国家公安军的声明。这个声明像晴天霹雳，像空中飞来的炸弹一样，把我们都震昏了。那些在一小时以前还认为是反革命分子的人，现在忽然被称为‘自由战士’。大家义愤填胸地责问道：假设他们是‘自由战士’那末我们是什么人？难道我们是叛徒吗？如果称反革命分子是‘民族英雄’，那末我们又是什么人？我们是公安队员，忠诚地执行着政府的命令，可是现在我们都变成了叛徒和凶手了！
    “兵营中引起极大的愤慲，士兵们一个个地跑来问我（因为我是他们的政治指导员），要求我给他说明真相。可是我能对他们说些什么呢！我自己也同样陷入极端困惑之中，纳吉的声明毁灭了我一切的信任。当时我们军官们已置生命于度外，但为士兵们惋惜，这些士兵都是工农家庭出身的子弟，他们到最后一分钟也不曾忘记军人的誓言。我们要拯救他们。我们的上级向附近的国防军兵营为士兵们索取普通军队的服装和证件，国防军兵营开始时曾答应我们的要求，但后来拒绝了。我们的战士们马上识破那里已有叛徒。
    “士兵们不断地来向我提出要求，要我们说明实况，他们认为这里一定发生了某种可怕的误会，不相信眼前发生的事。‘不，政府不能离开我们，不能抛弃我们，因为这对政府将是自杀的道路！我们难道不是政府最坚定可靠的保护者吗？我们难道不是直到最后一分钟都忠心耿耿完成了政府的一切指示吗？’士兵们发出了一致的抗议声。
    “我们推选了一个军官代表团。我们总的意见是必须争取到和纳吉面谈，弄清真相。当天晚上，我们的上校军官打电话给纳吉，以公安队代表团的名义要求他接见。但纳吉的回答是：‘我不接见你们，我没有时间。’士兵们愤怒地声言：我们还有六百多人，大家拿起武器到国会大厦去，非要求纳吉和我们谈判不可！这时我们的上校又打电话给纳吉，并告诉他士兵们的意见。这对纳吉起了作用。他答应明天上午十时到国会大厦，从十二号大门进去，他在那里接见我们。
    “我们准时到达国会大厦，我们有的穿便服，有的已改着普通军装，没有携带武器，只我一人偶然地留下一枝小手枪。因为纳吉在电话中说明不准携带武器。在进口处确有人在等着，并告诉现在纳吉还不能接见，叫我们到大厦对面农业部的客厅里去等候。
    “我们事先和兵营中的士兵们约好：假使在下午一时还没有通知他们，即说明我们已被逮捕，那时士兵们将带武器到国会大厦来营救。因此，我们每分钟都很紧张，但时间已到十一时，我们还坐等着。
    “忽然门被打开了，一个全副武装的小组走进客厅，这是维斯普列姆州‘革命委员会’的代表团。随后，其他地区的一些‘革命委员会’和‘起义队伍’的代表也纷纷走进大厅，他们都说是纳吉约好他们来谈判的。我们不能理解为什么这些武装的反革命分子也被带进到我们所在的这间客厅。在农业部里有的是空房子，这样他们会给我们以致命的威胁。大家都称呼维斯普列姆州代表团的团长为老板先生，他要我说明来历，因恐我们之中有公安队的奸细。我回答说：‘同志，不要怕，我们之间没有公安队的奸细。’‘什么同志！对不起，我是经理先生。请你们注意，同志的称号已一去不复返了。’他得意忘形地说。
    “我们彼此看了一看，我已经完全明白我在和谁谈话。我们紧挨着墙，继续等待。这时又来了新的武装小组，他们彼此争论，争论着他们各自不同的要求。因为我们没有要求，也没有争吵，就愈来愈引起他们的怀疑了。
    “我注意到气氛愈来愈不对头，但是又不能空手而归，必须向纳吉问清他将怎样安排我们的命运。时间已近下午一时，我派了一个士兵去向兵营打电话。士兵回来说，兵营没有人接电话。大家都不敢相信营里已发生什么问题。这时忽然有人叫喊：‘这些是公安队员，收拾他们！’我立刻对自己的人向窗口投了一个眼色，我们四个人马上越窗而出，飞快地跑上停放在离窗不远地方的汽车。反革命分子虽然从大门追出来，但已来不及抓住我们。
    “我们的车子放足马力开往兵营。我们刚要进入院内，忽然看到撕破衣襟、身上血淋淋的许多士兵向四面街上跑出。院子门口已站着不认识的匪徒。他们一看到我们马上喊起：‘你们也是肮脏的公安军！紧跟着就用手去摸枪柄。我们又转身开车奔跑，身后已响起哒哒的枪声。
    “当我们这样从惊险中脱逃出来还不能完全断定事情真相的时候，纳吉和他的同谋者知道在农业部的客厅里有公安队的军官代表团在等候着他。他们利用这个时机，趁兵营里没有领导人在的时候，便先下手消灭他们已认为可恨的军队。这是一个多么狡猾的阴谋啊！我们很多忠诚的战士成为这个诡计的牺牲品了！
    “我们记得纳吉把我们解除武装之后，杜达什匪帮在街上到处屠杀我们的士兵，把他们挂在街灯杆上和苏军纪念碑上。这一切都是为了什么？是因为公安队是保卫无产阶级专政最可靠的武装力量吗？他们为了保卫工农政权战斗到结束生命的最后一分钟。反革命分子是知道这个的，因此，要追踪公安军。叛徒们也知道我们是他们出卖祖国的最大障碍，因此也要消灭我们。”
    反革命分子对公安军加以种种诽谤和污蔑，煽惑人民对他的鄙视和仇恨。但是，这些战士都是劳动人民中最纯洁最诚朴的工农子弟。他们为保卫国家的利益，为社会主义的事业而献出了自己的幸福和年轻的生命。他们之中有的留下年轻的寡妻和幼小的儿女，有的成了终身的残废者。对于这个悲剧的发生，纳吉集团难道不应当负最大的责任吗？“五人委员会”关于“匈牙利问题”的一纸报告能够洗清纳吉集团的罪恶血手吗？
    现在，当反革命已被粉碎、生活秩序已经恢复的今天，公安军官兵们在这次斗争中的功绩，将会得到匈牙利全国人民的承认和尊敬。
