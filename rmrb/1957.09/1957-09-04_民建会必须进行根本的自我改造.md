    The China Democratic National Construction Association Must Undergo Fundamental Self-Transformation
    Sun Qimeng, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association
  The People's Daily published an editorial on August 29th entitled "The Serious Tasks of All Democratic Parties," which provided a profound analysis and scientific demonstration of the political and organizational character of the democratic parties, as well as their future direction and tasks. For the democratic parties, this editorial should be regarded as an ideological weapon and guiding force to help them transform themselves and become active forces truly serving socialism. Future facts will prove that this editorial will exert a tremendous driving force on the road forward for all democratic parties.
    From the perspective of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), the serious task of self-transformation proposed by the editorial to the democratic parties is entirely consistent with its situation. The comrades of the CDNCA have a particularly deep understanding of this. This is because the CDNCA had already engaged in fierce debates with rightist Zhang Naiqi on fundamental issues such as the dual nature of the bourgeoisie and class relations at its Second Plenary Session last year and the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee prior to that. The meeting concluded with a unanimous resolution criticizing Zhang Naiqi's reactionary stance, which was a major victory in the criticism of the rightists. However, judging from the situation before and after the meeting, Zhang Naiqi was indeed not isolated in industrial and commercial circles. He boasted of being the "telepathist of the bourgeoisie," which was both wrong and right. Wrong, because he was not in tune with the positive aspect of industrial and commercial circles accepting socialist transformation; right, because the capitalist stance of many industrialists and businessmen was closely connected with him. As for the rightists in industrial and commercial circles, they were originally birds of a feather. The fact that this political stance in industrial and commercial circles has not undergone the necessary transformation has become even more evident since the launch of the Party's rectification campaign, especially the anti-rightist struggle. A large number of facts prove that, due to the conspiracies of the rightists, there was indeed a problem of wanting to create two CDNCA's, not only in the political line but also in the organizational line: one was the rightist anti-Party, anti-socialist CDNCA, and the other was the CDNCA that accepted the leadership of the Party and accepted socialist transformation. Those who were engaged in the rightist CDNCA had Zhang Naiqi at the helm nationwide, and almost every region had his henchmen. Tampering with the political and organizational lines of the CDNCA was only a component of the entire reactionary activities of the rightists. Their conspiracies, of course, went far beyond this. What do these facts show? It shows that the CDNCA does need to carry the anti-rightist struggle through to the end, and it does need to carry out fundamental self-transformation. This self-transformation work should be carried out in two aspects: political and organizational. In the political aspect, it is necessary to further transform the political stance of affiliated organizations and members, so that organizations at all levels and all members can gradually and earnestly overcome the capitalist stance and stand on the socialist stance. In the organizational aspect, it is necessary to carry out necessary rectification of affiliated organizations, change any organizational situation in the leadership that may hinder the realization of political transformation, and strengthen the organizational foundation of the association, so that the organizational character not only adapts to the requirements of political transformation, but also ensures the resolute implementation of the political line of serving socialism.
    The above-mentioned transformation is necessary and achievable, but it cannot be imagined that it will be achieved without serious struggle and mobilizing the masses. The rectification movement currently being carried out by the democratic parties is a political and ideological struggle that mobilizes all members. Only by throwing oneself into the struggle can any group or individual transform themselves; it is difficult to achieve any transformation by staying away from the struggle. Therefore, if we fully agree with regarding fundamental self-transformation as a serious task of the democratic parties, we must participate in, support, promote, and even lead the ongoing rectification work with the greatest enthusiasm.
    The editorial points out that criticizing the rightists is the main key and decisive step in the rectification movement. We have a deep understanding of this in our work of participating in the anti-rightist struggle of the CDNCA and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC). Only by conducting the anti-rightist struggle deeply and thoroughly can members and organizations distinguish between fundamental rights and wrongs and transform their political stance profoundly rather than superficially in the general rectification. When the exposure of the rightists is more thorough and the criticism is more in-depth, don't we feel that we are also undergoing profound socialist transformation at the same time? From a formal point of view, we are criticizing individual rightists, but in essence, we are conducting vivid socialist education for the masses through this. Therefore, it must not be assumed that carrying out rectification means the end of the anti-rightist struggle, or that the anti-rightist struggle can be concluded hastily. General rectification should be carried out on the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, and the work of criticizing the rightists should be consistently implemented throughout the entire rectification movement. Isolating and dividing the rightists obviously cannot be fully achieved in the stage of the anti-rightist struggle, and it is necessary to continue to isolate and divide them when carrying out general rectification. The more general rectification is carried out and deepened, the more people criticize and transform the capitalist stance, and the more people transform to the left; in this case, the rightists will fall into an increasingly isolated predicament. Destroying the political and mass base of the rightists is the heaviest blow to the rightists. Here, we not only see the decisive role of criticizing the rightists in the entire rectification movement, but also see the great significance of general rectification for isolating and dividing the rightists.
    The editorial mentions that the leadership of the democratic parties' rectification must have a firm stand, which is worth reflecting on a lot. The so-called firm stand should be a firm socialist stand, that is, a firm left-wing stand. It would certainly be a fraud to lead the rectification with the right-wing stand, and it would be more harmful than helpful to lead the rectification with the middle-of-the-road stand. The main manifestations of the middle-of-the-road stand are sentimentalism and right-leaning emotions. Is it almost done? Be careful to prevent excessive struggle! And so on. Should deviations and errors be noted and prevented? Absolutely, but not to ease the anti-rightist struggle, but to strengthen the anti-rightist struggle, to fight the rightists more accurately and more ruthlessly. The questions raised by those with right-leaning emotions are very similar, but their starting points and purposes are very different. What they hope is that the movement will stop appropriately and that the struggle will end as soon as possible. Obviously, this kind of emotion and thinking will only benefit the rightists and not the anti-rightists. Therefore, sentimentalism is the air-raid shelter of the rightists, and right-leaning emotions are the agents of the rightists. These have nothing in common with the firm stand that the leadership of the rectification must have. According to the current situation of the anti-rightist struggle of the CDNCA and the ACFIC, the issue that should be paid attention to is precisely here, so the deviation that needs to be put on the agenda for prevention and overcoming is not a "left"-leaning problem such as excessive struggle, but the rather widespread problem of sentimentalism and right-leaning emotions.
    The leading personnel of the CDNCA and the ACFIC in Beijing have been holding meetings since the day before yesterday to study and discuss this editorial and the talk by Comrade Li Weihan published in the People's Daily on August 27th. In a few days, the joint meeting of the Central (Executive) Committees of the two associations will begin. The leading groups of the two associations will draw lessons from the above-mentioned editorial and talk, improve their work, better carry out and deepen the anti-rightist struggle and rectification, and further transform themselves from the movement.

    民建会必须进行根本的自我改造
    中国民主建国会副主任委员　孙起孟
  8月29日人民日报发表了以“各民主党派的严重任务”为题的社论，对各民主党派的政治面貌、组织面貌以及今后的方针任务，作出了深刻的分析和科学的论证。这篇社论，对于各民主党派说来，应当看作一种帮助自己进行改造，使自己能够成为真正为社会主义服务的积极因素的思想武器和指导力量。今后的事实会证明：这篇社论，将在各民主党派前进的道路上发生巨大的推动作用。
    从中国民主建国会的角度看来，社论向各民主党派提出的进行自我改造的严重任务，是同它的情况完全相符的。对于这一点，民建会的同志们具有特别深切的体会。这是因为民建会在去年的二中全会以及此前的中常会扩大会议上，就曾经同右派分子章乃器在资产阶级两面性、阶级关系等原则问题上展开激烈的辩论。这个会议是以一致通过批判章乃器的反动立场的决议为结局的，这是批判右派的一次很大的胜利，但是从会议前后的情况看来，章乃器在工商界中的确并不孤立。他自诩为“资产阶级的他心通”，这句话是又不对又对。又不对，是因为他同工商界接受社会主义改造的积极一面是不通的，又对，是因为很多工商业者的资本主义立场这一面是同他息息相通的，至于工商界中的右派分子则同他本来是一丘之貉。工商界中这种政治立场没有得到必要的改造的情况，从党整风，特别是反右派斗争开展以来，暴露得更为明显。大量的事实证明：由于右派分子的阴谋活动，不仅在政治路线上，而且在组织路线上，的确存在着想搞两个民建会的问题：一个是右派的反党、反社会主义的民建会，一个是接受党的领导、接受社会主义改造的民建会。搞右派民建会的，在全国有章乃器挂帅，几乎各地都有他的虾兵蟹将。篡改民建会的政治路线和组织路线，这只是右派分子整个反动活动中的一个组成部分。他们的阴谋，当然远不止此。这些事实说明什么？说明民建会确有必要把反右派斗争进行到底，确有必要进行根本的自我改造。这个自我改造工作大体上要从两方面进行：一是政治方面，二是组织方面。政治方面，就是要进一步对所属组织和成员的政治立场进行必要的改造，使各级组织和全体成员都能够逐步地、认真地克服资本主义立场，站到社会主义立场上来。组织方面，就是要对所属组织进行必要的整顿，改变领导机构中任何足以障碍实现政治改造的组织情况，健全会的组织基础，使组织面貌不仅同政治改造的要求相适应，而且能够保证坚决贯彻为社会主义服务的政治路线。
    上述的改造，是必须实现、也是能够实现的，但是，决不能设想不经过严重的斗争，不发动群众，就会实现。各民主党派正在进行的整风运动就是一场把全体成员动员起来的政治斗争和思想斗争。任何集团和个人，只有投身在斗争中才能够改造自己；离开斗争，是很难得到什么改造的。因此，我们要是完全同意以进行根本的自我改造作为民主党派的严重任务的话，就必须以最大的积极性来参加、支持、推动以至领导正在进行中的整风工作。
    社论指出：批判右派是整风运动的主要关键和决定性步骤。这一点，我们在参加民建会、工商联的反右派斗争的工作中有着亲切的体会。只有把反右派斗争搞得深、搞得透，才能够使成员和组织在一般整风中深刻地而不是浮泛地辨明根本是非，改造政治立场。当对于右派分子的揭露越彻底、批判越深入的时候，我们不是感到自己同时也在接受深刻的社会主义改造吗？从形式上看，是在对着一个个右派分子进行批判，实质上是通过这个向群众进行生动的社会主义教育。因此，决不能认为开展整风就意味着反右派斗争的结束或者反右派斗争可以草草收兵。一般整风要在反右派斗争的胜利基础上进行，而批判右派的工作，也要在整个整风运动中始终贯彻。孤立和分化右派分子，显然不是在反右派斗争的阶段中所能完全作到的，需要在进行一般整风的时候继续孤立和分化他们。一般整风越加开展和深入，也即愈来愈多的人批判和改造了资本主义立场，愈来愈多的人向左转化；在这样情况下，右派分子就会陷于越来越加孤立的困境。摧毁右派的政治基础和群众基础，这是对右派最沉重的打击。在这里，我们不仅看到批判右派在整个整风运动中的决定作用，而且看到一般整风对于孤立、分化右派的重大意义。
    社论提到民主党派的整风领导必须有坚定的立场的问题，这一点值得我们多多自省。所谓坚定的立场，应当是坚定的社会主义立场也即坚定的左派立场。以右派的立场来领导整风固然是个骗局，以中间的立场来领导整风也是成事不足、败事有余的。中间立场的主要表现是温情主义和右倾情绪。搞得差不多了吧？慎防斗争过火啊！等等。偏差和错误应不应当注意和防止？完全应当，但不是为了缓和反右派斗争而是为了加强反右派斗争，是为了对右派分子斗得越准，斗得越狠。有右倾情绪的人提出的问题是很相似的，但是他们的出发点和目的却大不相同。他们所希望的是运动适可而止，斗争尽快结束。显然这种情绪和想法只会有利于右派而不利于反右派。所以说，温情主义是右派的防空洞，右倾情绪是右派的代理人。这一些，同整风领导必须具有的坚定立场是毫无相似之处的。根据民建会、工商联反右派斗争的现状看来，应当注意的问题也正在这里，因此需要提到议事日程上来加以防止和克服的偏差，倒不是什么斗争过火等“左”倾问题，而是相当普遍的温情主义和右倾情绪的问题。
    民建会和全国工商联的在京领导人员，已自前日起举行集会，学习和讨论这篇社论以及8月27日人民日报上所载的李维汉同志的谈话。再过几天，民建会和全国工商联的中央（执行）委员会联席会议就要开始举行。两会的领导集团都将从上述的社论和谈话中取得教益，改进工作，把反右派斗争和整风更好地开展和深入下去，并且从运动中进一步改造自己。
