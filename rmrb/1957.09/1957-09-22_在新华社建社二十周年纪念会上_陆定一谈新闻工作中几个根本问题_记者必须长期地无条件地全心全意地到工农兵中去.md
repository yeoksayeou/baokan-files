Xinhua News Agency, September 21st. Xinhua News Agency headquarters held a meeting on the 19th to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its founding. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered an important speech at the commemoration meeting. Representatives from various news organizations in Beijing attended the commemoration meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Wu Lengxi, President of Xinhua News Agency.

Lu Dingyi congratulated all staff members of Xinhua News Agency. In his speech, he discussed the role and tasks of Xinhua News Agency, the work and ideological remolding of reporters and editors, and other fundamental issues in journalism.

Lu Dingyi pointed out that the news media is a tool of class struggle. Like the Party, the government, the army, the courts, newspapers, and schools, Xinhua News Agency is also one of the weapons of class struggle, a weapon in the hands of the working class and the people of the whole country to overthrow capitalism and build socialism. Xinhua News Agency sends out tens of thousands of words every day to educate and unite the people, expose and defeat the enemy, and promote the development of social productive forces.

Lu Dingyi said that the study of journalism should start from politics. Journalism is an extremely political discipline. To talk about news apart from politics is a bourgeois approach, and we should not do that. Whether a piece of news is published early, late, or not at all should be seriously considered from a political point of view. Reporters and editors have two tasks: to grab and to suppress. Some news should be rushed out, while some news should be suppressed if it should not be published. Reporters must understand politics; what should be grabbed, what should be suppressed, what should be taken, and what should be discarded must all be considered from a political perspective. Bourgeois journalists, because they have to make a living, have to completely obey their capitalists, so they have to understand politics. What they understand is bourgeois politics, imperialist politics. Our reporters must understand our own politics, the politics of the proletariat, the politics of the people, and the politics of socialism.

Regarding the technical aspects of journalism, Lu Dingyi said that we must unite ourselves, win over friends, and defeat the enemy, so we must have good weapons. Therefore, those of us who work in the news media must pay attention to journalistic techniques. Our techniques have shortcomings and need to be greatly improved. Some can be improved now, and all those that can be improved must be resolutely improved. Some cannot be improved now. For example, news needs to be sent out quickly, which requires various conditions and an industrial base. Without a good industrial base, sending news can only be fast to a certain extent, and it cannot be faster. In the relationship between technology and politics, we have always advocated politics first and technology subordinate to politics, because technology must serve politics to be meaningful, and only with political enthusiasm can technology be rapidly improved. Are our techniques good? I think they are basically good. Our news is accurate and reliable, which is a fine tradition of Xinhua News Agency, and this tradition must be maintained. However, shortcomings such as being lengthy and slow must be corrected.

Regarding the issue of interest in news, Lu Dingyi said that we must clarify what kind of interest it is and which class's interest it is. Interest also has class character. Our news is not intended to be of interest to our enemies, but to be of interest to those who approve and can approve of socialism, and internationally to be of interest to those who approve of and can approve of the new China. We must carefully study the interests of the broad masses of the people and carefully study the interests of our friends. Whether the reactionaries are interested is insignificant and can be ignored. During the period of great blooming and contending, the interest of the rightists was to set fires. Xinhua News Agency did not set fires, so the rightists sent people to set fires themselves, and they were not interested in your Xinhua News Agency. What's wrong with that?

Lu Dingyi said that the bourgeois rightists say that our reporters are all puppets, without generals. We also have to see which class the generals and puppets belong to. The generals among bourgeois journalists are merely puppets in the hands of capitalists who completely obey their orders. They have to do and think what their capitalist bosses want them to do and think, otherwise they risk losing their jobs, and organizations like the "House Un-American Activities Committee" will visit them. The socialist news media can produce generals. Reporters and editors who serve the people wholeheartedly are likely to become our generals, good reporters, and good editors. But we must never praise reporters and editors; praise is a bad habit of the bourgeoisie.

Regarding the issues of guidance and objectivity in news, Lu Dingyi said that our news reports can be divided into two types. One type, such as "fish can climb trees" and "playing the lute to cows can increase milk production," concerns natural phenomena. This accounts for a very small minority of news. The vast majority is another type, which concerns social phenomena. This type of news is closely related to various domestic and foreign policies. When reporters report this news, their own position, viewpoint, and method are expressed in the news, which influences the readers. This influence is guidance. The vast majority of news reports cannot be without guidance. Either influence the readers with a bourgeois viewpoint, or influence the readers with a proletarian viewpoint. There must be one or the other, and it is impossible to escape. Objectivity also has a class character; what one class considers objective, another class considers not objective. Imperialism is doomed to perish, only the People's Republic of China can represent the Chinese people, fixed interest is exploitation, and the policy of unified purchase and sale is good. These words have complete objectivity in the eyes of us Marxists, but Dulles and the bourgeois rightist gentlemen will certainly say that this is not objective. Some people say that if news has guidance, it will "block the people's intelligence." Some people talk about supra-class objectivity without talking about class. The essence of these two statements is the same, that is, to ask revolutionary journalists to abandon their political stand. And if the proletarian stand is abandoned, one will certainly go to the bourgeois stand. To reject proletarian guidance is to demand bourgeois guidance. Dogmatism will block intelligence, and revisionism is even worse, it will lead people to surrender to the bourgeoisie. But Marxism leads people to the correct path, and will only make people smarter, see through the essence of things, and grasp the objective laws of development of things. How can it block intelligence? Reporters must express their own position in their reports, sometimes clearly and sharply, sometimes implicitly and obscurely. Some reporters can express their views appropriately, while others are clumsier in this regard and do not understand tactics. At a certain time, for specific events, what attitude should be used to appropriately express one's views is another political consideration, sometimes a very serious political consideration. It is necessary to consider how expressing one's views can correctly guide readers, persuade and win over the majority of people who can be won over, and be most beneficial to the cause of the working class. This requires high political cultivation, skill, and experience.

When talking about the ideological remolding of reporters, Lu Dingyi said that reporters must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly. He said that to establish Marxist ideology, it is not enough to be familiar with Marxist-Leninist books. Intellectuals need to be remolded, they cannot despise labor, and they cannot look down on the laboring masses. Now many intellectuals say they support proletarian leadership in words, but in fact they look down on the proletariat and are incompatible with the working people. Therefore, promising reporters must be determined to go to the laboring masses for a long time, work together with the laboring masses, share life and death, share weal and woe, and become one with them. Only by changing one's own feelings, becoming a laborer oneself, becoming a member of the working class, can one serve the people unconditionally and wholeheartedly. It is very important for intellectuals to do this, because it is conducive to changing the social atmosphere. The bourgeois rightists say that Marxism is unacceptable, but we say that many of our reporters understand too little about Marxism. Our reporters have not gone to the masses for a long time, have not conducted in-depth investigations and research, so some of the things they write are not Marxist, or not completely Marxist. The rightists take the opportunity to exploit loopholes. Revolutionary reporters must work hard to study Marxism.

When talking about the relationship between Xinhua News Agency and newspapers, Lu Dingyi said that the news agencies and newspapers of our socialist country are one, both are tools of class struggle in the hands of the working class, their interests are consistent, and they are in a relationship of unity, cooperation, and mutual coordination. We should consider how to rationally use the reporter strength of news agencies and newspapers, and study how to jointly run our news work better.

Finally, when talking about improving work, Lu Dingyi said that we must have three hard lines: The first is to relentlessly oppose the rightists. This struggle is a long-term one, but this anti-rightist struggle is of decisive significance; the second is to relentlessly improve our work. There are many errors and shortcomings in our work, and we should strive to correct them; the third is to relentlessly remold our thinking. We must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly.

Xinhua News Agency was founded in Yan'an in April 1937. For twenty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Xinhua News Agency has gradually grown and strengthened along with the development of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. Now, Xinhua News Agency has thirty branches in China and twenty-one branches abroad. It currently releases approximately 60,000 words of domestic and international political, economic, and cultural news to domestic newspapers and radio stations every day; at the same time, it also sends 6,000 words of concise news and 3,000 words of broadcast recording news to newspapers at the prefectural level, small and medium-sized cities, and industrial and mining areas; it publishes approximately 10,000 words of Chinese and international news in English (Russian for Moscow) to various parts of the world, and provides news photos to newspapers at home and abroad.

    在新华社建社二十周年纪念会上
    陆定一谈新闻工作中几个根本问题
    记者必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵中去
    新华社21日讯　新华通讯社总社19日集会纪念建社二十周年。中共中央宣传部长陆定一在纪念大会上作了重要的讲话。出席纪念大会的有北京新闻界各单位的代表。
    大会由新华社社长吴冷西主持。
    陆定一向新华社的全体工作人员致贺。他在讲话中谈到了新华社的作用和任务、记者和编辑的工作和思想改造以及新闻工作中其他一些带根本性的问题。
    陆定一指出，新闻事业是阶级斗争的工具。同党、政府、军队、法庭、报纸、学校等一样，新华社也是阶级斗争的武器之一，是工人阶级和全国人民手中的用来推翻资本主义、建设社会主义的武器。新华社每天发稿几万字，是为了教育和团结人民，揭露和打倒敌人，促进社会生产力的发展。
    陆定一说，研究新闻学，应该从政治出发。新闻学是政治性极其强烈的一门学问。离开了政治来谈新闻，这是资产阶级的作法，我们不应当这样做。一件消息早发表、迟发表或不发表，都要从政治上来郑重考虑。记者和编辑有两种任务：一是抢，一是压。有的新闻要抢时间发出去，有的新闻不该发表就要压下来。记者一定要懂得政治；什么该抢，什么该压，什么该取，什么该舍，都必须从政治上考虑。资产阶级新闻记者，因为要维持生活，非完全服从他们的资本家不可，所以他们也非懂政治不可。他们懂的是资产阶级的政治，帝国主义的政治。我们的记者，要懂我们自己的政治，无产阶级的政治，人民的政治，社会主义的政治。
    关于新闻的技术问题，陆定一说，我们要团结自己，争取朋友，打倒敌人，就要有好的武器，因此，我们做新闻工作的人，要讲究新闻的技术，我们的技术有缺点，需要大大改进。有的现在可以改进，凡是可以改进的就要坚决改进。有的现在还不能改进，比如消息要发得快，这就需要有各种条件，要有工业基础，没有很好的工业基础，发消息只能快到一定限度，再要快就快不了。在技术与政治的关系上，我们向来主张政治第一，技术服从于政治，因为技术必须为政治服务才有意义，而且，只有有了政治热情，才能迅速改进技术。我们的技术好不好呢？我认为基本上是好的。我们的新闻是准确可靠的，这是新华社的优良传统，必须保持这个传统。但是，冗长和迟缓等缺点，必须改正。
    关于新闻要有兴趣的问题，陆定一说，我们要搞清楚是什么样的兴趣，是那个阶级的兴趣。兴趣也是有阶级性的。我们的消息，不是为了使我们的敌人看了有兴趣，而是为了使赞成和可以赞成社会主义的人们看了有兴趣，在国际上要使赞成新中国和可以赞成新中国的人们看了有兴趣。我们必须认真研究广大人民的兴趣，认真研究朋友们的兴趣。反动派的有无兴趣是无足轻重的，可以置之不理。在大鸣大放期间，右派的兴趣是放火，新华社不放火，于是右派自己派人去放火，对你们新华社不感兴趣，这有什么不好呢？
    陆定一说，资产阶级右派说我们的记者都是木偶，没有大将。这也要看看大将和木偶是那个阶级的。资产阶级记者中的大将，不过是资本家手中完全听话的木偶而已，资本家老板要他怎样做怎样想，他就得怎样做怎样想，否则他就有丢掉饭碗的危险，什么“非美活动调查委员会”之类的机关就会光顾他的。社会主义新闻事业可以出现大将。全心全意为人民服务的记者和编辑，就有可能成我们的大将，好记者、好编辑。但我们对于记者编辑决不要吹捧，吹捧是资产阶级的恶劣风气。
    关于新闻的指导性和客观性问题，陆定一说，我们的新闻报道可以分为两种。有一种，如像“鱼能上树”“对牛弹琴可以增产牛奶”等关于自然现象的。这在新闻中占极少数。占绝大多数的是另一种，是关于社会现象的。这类消息，同各项对内对外政策密切相关。记者报道这些新闻时，记者自己的立场、观点、方法就在新闻中表现出来，而给读者以影响。这种影响，就是指导性。绝大多数的新闻报道，都是不能没有指导性的。不是以资产阶级观点去影响读者，就是以无产阶级观点去影响读者，二者必居其一，要想逃避是不可能的。客观性也有阶级性，这个阶级认为是客观的，那个阶级认为不客观。帝国主义要灭亡，只有中华人民共和国能够代表中国人民，定息是剥削，统购统销政策是好的，这些话在我们马克思主义者看来都有十足的客观性，但是杜勒斯们和资产阶级右派先生们一定会说这是不客观的。有人说新闻如果有了指导性就会“闭塞人民的聪明”。有人不谈阶级而谈超阶级的客观性。这两种说法实质都是一样，就是要革命的新闻记者放弃自己的政治立场。而如果放弃了无产阶级的立场，就一定走到资产阶级的立场。不要无产阶级的指导性，就是要资产阶级的指导性。教条主义会闭塞聪明，修正主义更坏，会把人们引导去投降资产阶级。但是马克思主义把人们引上正确的道路，只会使人们聪明起来，看透事物的本质，掌握事物的客观的发展规律，那里会闭塞聪明呢？记者在报道中是一定要表示自己的立场的，有时表示得明显尖锐，有时表示得含蓄晦涩。有的记者，能把自己的观点恰到好处地表现出来，有的记者则在这点上做得比较笨，不懂策略。在一定的时间，对具体的事件，应该用什么态度恰到好处地表示自己的观点，这又是一个政治考虑，有时是很严重的政治考虑。要考虑到怎样表示自己的观点才能够正确指导读者，并说服和争取可以争取的大多数人，最有利于工人阶级的事业。这就又需要很高的政治修养，需要技巧，需要经验。
    陆定一在谈到记者的思想改造时说，记者必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去。他说，要树立马克思主义思想，光熟读马列主义书籍不行。知识分子要改造，不能轻视劳动，不能看不起劳动群众。现在有很多知识分子口头上说无产阶级领导，实际上却看不起无产阶级，同劳动人民格格不入。因此，有出息的记者，要下决心，长期地到劳动群众中去，和劳动群众共同劳动，同生死，共患难，打成一片。只有改变了自己的感情，自己变成了劳动者，变成了工人阶级的一分子，才会无条件地全心全意地为人民服务。知识分子这样做，有利于改变社会风气，因而是很重要的。资产阶级右派说马克思主义要不得，我们说我们的许多记者，马克思主义还懂得太少。我们的记者没有长期到群众中去，没有深入地调查研究，因此写出的东西有些就不是马克思主义的，或者不完全是马克思主义的。右派就趁机钻空子。革命的记者们必须努力学习马克思主义。
    陆定一谈到新华社同报纸的关系问题时说，我们社会主义国家的通讯社和报纸是一体的，都是工人阶级手中的阶级斗争的工具，利益是一致的，是团结、合作和互相配合的关系。应该考虑通讯社、报纸记者力量如何合理地使用的问题，研究怎样共同把我们的新闻工作办得更好。
    最后，在谈到改进工作的问题时，陆定一说，我们要有三个狠：第一个狠狠地反右派，这个斗争是长期的，但这次反右派斗争是有决定意义的；第二个是狠狠地改进工作，我们工作中有很多错误缺点，应努力纠正；第三个是狠狠地改造思想，要长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵中间去。
    新华社在1937年4月成立于延安。二十年来，新华社在中国共产党的领导下，随着中国人民革命运动的发展而逐渐成长、壮大。现在，新华社在国内有三十个分社，在国外有二十一个分社。它目前每天向国内的报纸和广播电台发布约六万字的国内和国际有关政治、经济和文化的消息；同时，每天还向专区级报纸、中小城市和工矿区报纸发六千字简要消息和三千字的口播记录消息；用英文（对莫斯科用俄文）向世界各地发布约一万字的中国和国际消息，并向国内外报纸供给新闻图片。
