Anhui Province has exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Chen Rengang, Secretary of the Party Group of the Provincial Department of Justice and Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Justice. This old rightist element, who had been hidden within the Party for a long time, carried out a series of anti-Party activities in an organized and planned manner.

Last winter and this spring, reactionary elements in rural Anhui Province, taking advantage of the difficulties caused by natural disasters, launched a rampant attack on the socialist system, especially on agricultural cooperatives, attempting to settle accounts and restore the old order. At that time, some cadres in the Anhui Provincial political and legal departments had serious right-leaning thoughts and did not give the reactionary elements the punishment they deserved, thus fueling the arrogance of the reactionary elements. In order to correct this deviation, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee instructed all localities to criticize right-leaning thought and resolutely crack down on various destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. However, Chen Rengang, who was responsible for judicial leadership, resisted the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and even deployed a task to oppose "leftism" at a meeting of county people's court presidents held in Bengbu. Subsequently, he went to southern Anhui behind the back of the Provincial Party Committee and convened a meeting of court presidents and judges from nine counties and one city, deploying his plan to investigate "mistakes" and oppose "leftism." He also, without authorization and in the name of the Department of Justice, distributed the summaries of his speeches at the meetings of county people's court presidents he convened in Bengbu and southern Anhui to judicial organs at all levels throughout the province, demanding that judicial cadres not "get carried away" or "blindly follow," attempting to incite judicial cadres throughout the province to resist the Provincial Party Committee's instructions to criticize right-leaning tendencies. He also publicized that "the Provincial Party Committee's proposal this spring to criticize right-leaning tendencies in the political and legal departments is wrong, inconsistent with the spirit of the central documents, and inconsistent with the situation below," in order to attack the Provincial Party Committee.

Chen Rengang intentionally fabricated the absurd claim that there were no bad elements in society, saying, "Anhui is a large province, and it is not surprising to have one or two counter-revolutionary cases, and there is no need to be alarmed."

During the Anhui Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Conference in May of this year, Chen Rengang launched a frenzied attack on the Party. Among the cadres of the Department of Justice, he publicized the false materials he fabricated in southern Anhui and Feidong and his absurd arguments against criticizing right-leaning tendencies, in order to win people over and organize anti-Party forces. Chen Rengang's fallacies at the propaganda conference were criticized, and he became isolated. However, this anti-Party element used his power as the Secretary of the Party Group to illegally convene an enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the Department of Justice, organized thugs, and launched a counterattack against the Party. He first delivered a provocative speech at the meeting opposing the Provincial Party Committee's instructions to criticize right-leaning tendencies, and then some people who had been targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and had serious right-leaning thoughts openly echoed him. Chen Rengang used these people's words as a basis to insist that the meeting "unanimously believed" that the Provincial Party Committee's proposal to criticize right-leaning tendencies this spring was inappropriate. After the meeting, he led a group of thugs he had gathered, clamoring at the political and legal work symposium that "criticizing right-leaning tendencies has messed up the lower levels" and "criticizing right-leaning tendencies has destroyed the legal system established over the years," and even clamored that "it is necessary to solve the Party Committee's thinking," openly demanding that the Party obey him.

After the rectification movement began, Chen Rengang colluded with the non-Party rightist element Li Xiangruo, Director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Justice, to attack the Party from within and without. Chen Rengang knew that Li Xiangruo was treacherous and had always been dissatisfied with the Party. However, Chen Rengang, without any principles, allowed Li to participate in important Party meetings that he did not need to attend, showed Li Xiangruo confidential Party documents, and told him about the reactionary so-called "investigation" materials he had collected in the countryside. Li Xiangruo used many of the above materials when attacking the Party.

Chen Rengang has consistently resisted organizational decisions, opposed the leadership of the Party, and adopted an irresponsible attitude toward his work. When Chen Rengang was the Commissioner of Chuxian Prefecture, he also confronted the Prefectural Party Committee and did not discuss the main issues in his work with the Prefectural Party Committee, and he absurdly believed that the Prefectural Party Committee "interfered too much" with him and was "substituting the Party for the government."

Chen also consistently shielded and placed trust in counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements in his work, and used his power to promote them. When Chen worked in Chuxian, he trusted Quan Shichao, a counter-revolutionary element who had served as a regimental commander in the puppet army, and entrusted him with the custody of the commissioner's private seal. Yang Zhanguo, director of the Anhui Provincial Youth Army Friendship Association, was in charge of managing books in the commissioner's office, and Chen believed that it was a "waste of talent," and later promoted him to be the head of the planning section. The Prefectural Party Committee disagreed many times, but Chen still insisted on his own way. Later, Yang Zhanguo was arrested by us for carrying out sabotage activities. In March of this year, in southern Anhui, Chen Rengang asked the four counties and cities of Shexian, Jixi, Ningguo, and Tunxi to review cases that had been repeatedly inspected and factually judged in 1955. He also personally reviewed two cases, attempting to change the sentence of Yu Boyuan, a former controlled counter-revolutionary element who had been convicted of spreading rumors and slandering the people's government and disrupting the unified purchase and sale, to "educational release," and to give the illegal landlord element Wang Biyu a "waiver from criminal punishment." Chen Rengang also regarded his shielding of counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements as a "model" and asked the judicial cadres of these counties and cities to follow his example, attempting to exonerate criminals from their crimes.

From the class background of this anti-Party element, we can see more clearly his consistent right-leaning, his consistent standing on the position of landlords and rich peasants, and his ugly face of carrying out anti-Party activities. Chen Rengang came from a semi-landlord and rich peasant family, and before joining the revolutionary ranks, he had participated in the Kuomintang secret service peripheral organization. After he joined the Party in 1940, he automatically withdrew from the Party in order to protect the interests of his landlord and rich peasant family. After rejoining the Party in 1942, he still adhered to the position of landlords and rich peasants, and even after participating in the 1943 rectification, he helped his family buy more than 80 mu of land. During the land reform, he openly shielded his landlord family. During the Three-Anti Campaign, he poured cold water on activists and the masses. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, he advocated using persuasive education methods to replace the struggle against the enemy. In this rectification and anti-rightist struggle, he did everything possible to prevent the masses from struggling against Li Xiangruo, the rightist Director of the Department of Justice, attempting to do his best to cover up this rightist element and help him get away with it. Chen Rengang, this old rightist element, finally completely exposed his ugly true colors under the exposure of the masses.

    扬言今天已无坏人　抗拒党的肃反方针
    陈仁刚要对反革命施仁政
    安徽省揭露了这个久藏党内的老右派的反党言行
    本报讯　安徽省揭发了省司法厅党组书记、司法厅副厅长陈仁刚的反党反社会主义的言行。这个久藏党内的老右派分子，有组织有计划地进行了一系列的反党活动。
    去冬今春，安徽省农村中的反动分子，利用自然灾害所造成的困难，对社会主义制度，特别是对农业合作社，展开了猖狂进攻，企图倒算和复辟。当时安徽省政法部门某些干部有严重的右倾思想，没有给予反动分子以应有的打击，因此，助长了反动分子的嚣张气焰。为了纠正这种偏向，安徽省委曾指示各地批判右倾思想，坚决打击反革命分子和坏分子的各种破坏活动。但是，身负司法领导责任的陈仁刚，却抗拒省委指示，竟在蚌埠召开的县人民法院院长会议上布置反“左”的任务。接着，他又背着省委赶赴皖南，召集了九县一市的法院院长、审判员会议，布置他的查 “错”反“左”计划。他还擅自以司法厅的名义，把他在蚌埠、皖南召集的县人民法院院长会议上的发言摘要，发给全省各级司法机关，要求司法干部不要“脑子发热”“盲目附和”，妄图煽动全省司法干部与党委批判右倾的指示相对抗。他并且大肆宣扬，说“省委今春提出在政法部门批判右倾是错误的，与中央文件精神不符，与下面情况不符”，以此来攻击省委。
    陈仁刚有意制造社会上没有坏分子的谰言，并说：“安徽是个大省，发生一两件反革命案件不算什么，值不得大惊小怪。”
    在今年5月安徽省委宣传会议期间，陈仁刚又向党疯狂进攻。在司法厅干部当中，大肆宣传他在皖南和肥东所制造的假材料和他反对批判右倾的荒谬论点，来争取人，拉拢人，组织反党力量。陈仁刚在宣传会议上发表了谬论，遭到批判，陷于孤立。但是这个反党分子利用党组书记的职权，居然非法召开司法厅党组扩大会议，组织打手，向党反扑。他首先在会上发表了带煽动性的反对省委批判右倾指示的意见，接着便有一些曾是肃反对象和有严重右倾思想的人公开附和。陈仁刚即以这些人的话为依据，硬说会议“一致认为”今春省委提出的批判右倾不当。会后，他率领了自己笼络的一批打手，在政法工作座谈会上叫嚣“批判右倾把下边搞乱了”和“批判右倾把几年来建立起来的法制搞掉了”等等。甚至扬言“要解决党委思想”，明目张胆地要党服从他。
    整风运动开始以后，陈仁刚和党外右派分子、安徽省司法厅厅长李湘若里应外合向党进攻。李湘若为人奸诈，一贯对党不满，陈仁刚是知道的。但陈却毫无原则地吸收李参加不必要参加的党的重要会议，把党内机密文件给李湘若看，并将他自己下乡收集的那些反动的所谓“调查”材料，告诉李湘若。李湘若在向党进攻时，就运用了不少上述材料。
    陈仁刚一贯抗拒组织决定，反对党的领导，对工作采取了不负责任的态度。陈仁刚担任滁县专员的时候，也和地委分庭抗礼，有关工作中的主要问题也不经地委研究，并且还荒谬地认为地委对其“干涉过多”，是“以党代政”。
    陈在工作中还一贯包庇、重用反革命分子和坏分子，并利用职权加以提拔。陈在滁县工作时，对曾在伪军当过团长的反革命分子权世超十分信任，将专员私章交给他保管。伪安徽省青年军联谊会主任杨战国，在专署管理图书，陈认为是“大材小用”，后提拔为计划科长。地委多次不同意，但陈仍一意孤行。此后，杨战国因进行破坏活动，才被我逮捕。今年3月间在皖南的时候，陈仁刚要歙县、绩溪、宁国、屯溪四个县市复查1955年早经多次检查并据实判决的案件。他还亲手检查两个案件，企图把因造谣污蔑人民政府、破坏统购统销而判罪的原被管制的反革命分子俞伯渊改判“教育释放”，把不法地主分子汪碧玉“免予刑事处分”。陈仁刚还把他这种包庇反革命分子和坏分子作为“榜样”，要这些县市的司法干部仿效，企图为犯罪分子开脱罪责。
    从这个反党分子的阶级出身，可以更加看清他一贯右倾、始终站在地主富农立场、进行反党活动的丑恶面目。陈仁刚是半地主式富农家庭出身，混入革命队伍以前，曾参加过国民党特务外围组织。1940年他混入党以后，为了保护其地富家庭利益，曾自动脱党。1942年重新混入党内，他仍然坚持地主富农立场，甚至在参加1943年的整风以后，还帮助家里买了八十多亩地。土地改革时，更明目张胆地包庇地主家庭。在三反时，他向积极分子和群众泼冷水。在肃反运动中，他主张用说服教育的方法，来代替对敌斗争。在这次整风和反右派斗争中，他又多方阻止群众对司法厅厅长右派分子李湘若的斗争，企图尽力掩护这个右派分子蒙混过关。陈仁刚这个老右派分子，终于在群众揭发下彻底暴露了丑恶的原形。
