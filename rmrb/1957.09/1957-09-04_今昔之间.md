    Between Past and Present
    Shi Yichao
    Not long ago, many right-wing elements clamored that "the present is not as good as the past." No matter what they talked about, they would launch into a fit of "the present is not as good as the past" lament. In their "lamentations," it seemed that although time was advancing, China was regressing. The China currently engaged in socialist construction seemed to be worse than the semi-feudal, semi-colonial China.
    If the situation in China were truly like this, it wouldn't be unreasonable for the right-wing elements to "lament" a bit. The problem is: China has undergone earth-shaking changes and is moving forward prosperously, but the right-wing elements stubbornly insist that "the present is not as good as the past." Whether or not "the present is not as good as the past" is true can be correctly answered by comparing the situations of "the present" and "the past." For example: Before liberation, landlords monopolized the land, and peasants groaned under the heavy burden of rent and taxes; now, the vast number of peasants have embarked on the road of collectivization and are gradually beginning to live a prosperous life. Is this a case of the present being worse than the past, or the past being worse than the present? For example: Since China began constructing its steel industry, the annual output has stagnated at several hundred thousand tons for decades; in the short few years after liberation, steel production has increased to an annual output of more than four million tons. Is this a case of the present being worse than the past, or the past being worse than the present? For example: Before liberation, imperialists dared to hang signs saying "Chinese and dogs not allowed" in front of parks on Chinese soil, insulting the Chinese people; now, the Chinese people have stood up and truly become the masters of China. Is this a case of the present being worse than the past, or the past being worse than the present? Many, many similar facts could be cited to prove that the current China is not a case of the present being worse than the past, but rather the past being worse than the present.
    However, the right-wing elements have their unique logic, stubbornly insisting that "the present is not as good as the past." It seems that they are not just talking nonsense; their lamentations are not just a meaningless groan, but have some factual basis. Didn't you see that Long Yun used to be the "King of Yunnan," dominating one side and doing whatever he wanted; now, he can neither "dominate" nor act recklessly. In this respect, it is indeed a bit of "the present is not as good as the past." Didn't you see that Huang Shaohong used to arbitrarily take lives and slaughter revolutionaries in Guangxi and Zhejiang, holding "human head conferences"; now, apart from crying injustice for counter-revolutionaries, he has nowhere to display his old authority. In this respect, it is also a bit of "the present is not as good as the past." Didn't you see how imposing Luo Yiqun was when he returned home in glory, a wave of his cane and thousands of acres of land became his; now, when he returns to his hometown to collect materials about the suffering of peasants, he is surrounded by peasants who reason with him and struggle against him, refuting him so that he flees in disgrace. This is indeed "the present is not as good as the past." And so on, there are certainly many more people like this whose "present is not as good as the past."
    The happiness of these people in the past was entirely built on the blood and tears, suffering and death of countless people. The people have already learned enough. Now, that kind of social life in which a very few people enjoy happiness while the majority suffer has gone forever. Now is the world of the people, the century of the people. The logic of history is this: the right-wing elements' "the present is not as good as the past" is precisely the people's "the past is not as good as the present." The people's "the past is not as good as the present" is a great good thing, and the right-wing elements' "the present is not as good as the past" is also not a bad thing, but also a great good thing. Here, a clear-cut issue of stance is presented, depending on what stance you take when comparing the present with the past. If you stand on the position of the reactionary and backward classes (including landlords, compradors, warlords, bureaucrats, the bourgeoisie, and all kinds of people who depend on them for their livelihoods), it is called "the present is not as good as the past"; if you stand on the position of the people, then it is "the past is not as good as the present." "Present" or "past," such is the mystery!

    今昔之间
    石一迢
    不久以前，不少的右派分子都大叫“今不如昔”。不论谈到什么，他们都要发一通“今不如昔”的感慨。在他们的“感慨”中，仿佛时间虽在前进，中国却在倒退，现在正在进行社会主义建设的中国，似乎反而不如半封建、半殖民地的中国了。
    中国的现状，如果真是这样，右派分子因而“感慨”一下，这也未尝不可。问题是：中国已经起了翻天覆地的变化，正在欣欣向荣地向前迈进，而右派分子却硬说是“今不如昔”。究竟是不是“今不如昔”，这只要将“今”和“昔”的情况比较一下，就可以得出一个正确的答案来。比如：解放前，地主垄断了土地，农民呻吟在苛重的租税下；现在，广大农民走上了合作化的道路，逐渐开始了富裕的生活，这是今不如昔呢？还是昔不如今呢？比如：从中国建设钢铁工业开始，几十年来，一直停滞在几十万吨的年产量上；解放后短短几年的工夫，钢的产量提高到四百多万吨的年产量上，这是今不如昔呢？还是昔不如今呢？比如：解放前，在中国土地上的公园门前，帝国主义者竟敢悬挂“华人与狗不准入内”的牌子，对中国人民进行污辱；现在，中国人民站起来了，真正的做了中国的主人，这是今不如昔呢？还是昔不如今呢？类似这样的事实，还可以举出很多很多，证明现在的中国并不是今不如昔，而是昔不如今。
    可是，右派分子有他们独特的逻辑，一口咬定就是“今不如昔”。看来，他们似乎并不是瞎说一顿，他们的感慨，并不是无病呻吟，而是有点事实根据的。君不见，龙云过去是“云南王”，独霸一方，为所欲为，现在，既不能“独霸”，又不能胡为；在这一点上说来，确实是有点“今不如昔”了。君不见，黄绍竑过去在广西、浙江，随意草菅人命，屠杀革命者，开人头大会；现在，除过为反革命分子呼冤叫屈以外，也无处施展旧日的威风，在这一点上说来，也同样是有点“今不如昔”了。君不见，罗翼群当年衣锦还乡时何等威风，用手杖一划，上千亩地就算是他的了，现在，当他回乡去搜集农民生活苦的材料的时候，却被农民包围起来，向他进行说理斗争，驳得他狼狈而逃，这也的确是“今不如昔”了。等而下之，类似这样“今不如昔”的人，当然还会有不少。
    这些人过去的幸福，完全是建立在无数人的血和泪、痛苦和死亡的基础上，人民早已领教够了。现在，过去那种极少数人享福、大多数人受苦的社会生活，已一去不复返了。现在是人民的天下，人民的世纪了。历史的逻辑是这样：右派分子的“今不如昔”，正是人民群众的“昔不如今”。人民群众的“昔不如今”是大大的好事，右派分子的“今不如昔”也不是坏事，也是大大的好事。这里就明摆着一个立场问题，看你站在什么立场将今比昔。如果你站在反动的落后的阶级（包括地主、买办、军阀、官僚、资产阶级以及依附他们生活的各色人等）的立场来看，就叫做“今不如昔”；如果你站在人民的立场来看，那就是“昔不如今”。“今”乎“昔”乎，此中奥妙，又如斯乎！
