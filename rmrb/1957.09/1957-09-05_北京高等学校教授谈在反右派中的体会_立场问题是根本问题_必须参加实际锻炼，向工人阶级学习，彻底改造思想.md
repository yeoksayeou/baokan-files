    Reported by our newspaper: Through the training and testing of the anti-Rightist struggle, professors from various universities in Beijing have generally improved their socialist consciousness and have more trust and love for the Party. From interviews with our reporters and their reflections published in school publications, it can be seen that they deeply realize that they must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen ideological remolding, and better serve the cause of socialist construction in the future.

    Through this anti-Rightist struggle, many professors have further realized that the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the successful construction of socialism in our country, and they love and trust the Party even more.

    Pang Jingren, Professor of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, said: I participated in this anti-Rightist struggle and deeply realized how dangerous it would be without the leadership of the Party and the victory on the socialist ideological front. When the Rightists were at their most rampant, it was the Party that guided me and kept me from losing my way. The reason why I was able to resolutely confront the Rightists in this struggle was also due to the education and strength the Party gave me. In the struggle, I realized even more profoundly how much a long-term bourgeois-educated intellectual like me needs to constantly remold his ideology. In the past, I always thought that I had undergone several movements and my ideology had been almost completely transformed. But this movement proved how inadequate I am in my ability to distinguish right from wrong and to distinguish between enemies and ourselves. I gradually recognized the reactionary nature of the Rightists, while the working class stood at the forefront of the anti-Rightist struggle from the very beginning, defending the Party and the direction of socialism. This movement has given me a good training and test, and I realize that intellectuals must continue to work hard to remold their ideology in order to stand firmly on the working-class position.

    Liu Ruozhuang, Associate Professor of Normal University, said that the Rightists gave us a vivid political lesson. Their purpose is to oppose the Party's leadership, because with the Party's leadership, we can be guaranteed to move towards socialism. They proposed that universities should be "run democratically," the purpose of which is to abolish the Party's leadership. If this attempt really succeeds, the heads of the schools will be Rightists, and then the school will become a reactionary group, which will reverse history and make it impossible to build socialism. Professor Yang Baochang said that the ideological struggle has made it clearer whether the Party can lead science. The Party can lead science. The reason why the Rightists raised this question was mainly to provoke scientists to leave the leadership of the Party. Secondly, they saw that most of the teachers in universities came from exploiting class families, so they looked for a market among them, trying to attack the Party in universities. It can be seen that it is even more necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership in universities.

    Xue Qinè®¿, Professor of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, said that it would have been impossible to achieve the basic victory of the socialist revolution and the brilliant achievements of socialist construction without the Party's correct policies. In this anti-Rightist struggle, workers and peasants were the first to stand up and fight back against the Rightists, completely sharing the same fate and heart with the Communist Party, and their enthusiasm for supporting the Party and socialism was very high. This shows that the relationship between the worker-peasant alliance is very solid. The socialist revolution needs the leadership of the Party, and socialist construction needs the leadership of the Party even more. Today, anyone who wants to weaken the Party's leadership will be battered and bruised.

    Many professors believe that it is necessary to strengthen the training of socialist standpoints.

    Li Youshan, Professor of Tsinghua University, said: I have been trained in this stage of the anti-Rightist struggle. To fight against the Rightists, one must have a deep feeling for the working class, otherwise the struggle itself will lack strength. At the beginning of the anti-Rightist struggle, my ideological understanding was not very clear, and my position was not as firm as that of the working class. But when I thought of how the words and deeds of the Rightists were detrimental to the Party's leadership and socialism, and realized that my interests were the same as those of the working class, my combat effectiveness became stronger and more substantial. At the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the workers were very combative. This is because they have rich class feelings. They expressed their infinite love for the Party and socialism with extremely simple language and vivid facts, which gave me a very profound class education. I realized that only by learning from the workers and combining with the workers can intellectuals stand firm.

    Jin Ruixin, Lecturer of Beijing Normal University, said that intellectuals have always been rich in feelings and like to manage right and wrong, but why are they so slow, calm, silent, and even indifferent on certain political issues? When it comes to their own interests, we are often very sensitive, even suspicious; but why are we as dull as wood when it comes to the rampant attacks of the Rightists? We often argue and find it difficult to tolerate a sentence that wrongs us; but why are we so generous and even foolish when it comes to the big issues of right and wrong in politics? We often hate people who have conflicts with us to the point of gnashing our teeth and refusing to let go, right? But why are we so gentle with the Rightists who try to shatter the happy lives of 600 million people? This is a serious matter of position! Stand firmly on the proletarian position and feel everything with clear proletarian thoughts and feelings. In this way, we will no longer suffer from political colds and be able to analyze and treat all problems with a clear distinction between right and wrong, love and hate.

    Yang Zengwei, Professor of Beijing Normal University, said that the training of position requires a long period of testing. When the evil wind was at its height, it was the working class and peasants who first stood up to defend the Party and socialism, and they were the first to fire the first shot at the Rightists, not the intellectuals. Through this movement, I realized the meaning of "strong grass knows the strong wind." Therefore, intellectuals must closely align themselves with the Party, accept the Party's leadership, and stand firmly on the proletarian position.

    Yang Qi, Associate Professor of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, said that I was too naive politically and lost my political vigilance. I never thought that during the period of helping the Party to rectify, there would be Rightists who would take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, take advantage of the fire to loot, and attack the Party. But the most important and fundamental reason was that my position was unstable during the blooming and contending period, and I only stood firm after being trained in the anti-Rightist struggle. Learning to stand firm is the biggest gain I have made in this movement.

    Many professors said that they must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and continue to remold their ideology.

    Hou Renzhi, Professor of Peking University, said: The anti-Rightist struggle has completely shattered all anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies and exposed the Rightists inside and outside the Party. Without this movement, it would be difficult to imagine how to build socialism. On the other hand, the anti-Rightist struggle has also educated the broad masses, especially for us intellectuals, it is a serious ideological education. The facts revealed by the entire anti-Rightist struggle tell us that ideological remolding is the necessary path for us to enter socialism. If we ignore this point, we will be captured by bourgeois ideology and deceived by class enemies at any time and anywhere. If we abandon the leadership of the Party, give up our political demands, and ignore politics, we will inevitably make mistakes. After this struggle, as a scientific worker, I must make higher demands on myself, demanding that I consciously study and apply Marxism-Leninism, stand firmly on the proletarian position, and establish the red banner of Marxism-Leninism in my own field of scientific research.

    Zhang Yun, Professor of China Union Medical College, said that most intellectuals come from exploiting-class families and have received bourgeois education, and some have even studied in capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. Therefore, the bourgeois ideology of many intellectuals is deeply rooted. Although some people have changed after ideological remolding movements, there are still many people who have not changed their position, and even insist on a reactionary position. At the beginning of the rectification, I was not very clear about some issues. For example, I only thought that Chu Anping's remarks about "the Party's world" were too sharp. Why is my political sense not high? This is the issue of position. For intellectuals, to change their position, they must carry out ideological remolding, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and more importantly, participate in practical training to integrate theory with practice. Through this anti-Rightist struggle, the broad masses have been educated, and their ideological understanding has been improved.

    Zhou Zuoren, Professor of the Finance Department of Renmin University of China, said that in this fierce anti-Rightist struggle, I, an old professor in my sixties, like many intellectuals, received a very good training. At first, I did not have a very clear understanding of the anti-Rightist struggle. It was only after the disclosure of the Rightists' ulterior motives of anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies that I was greatly shocked. In the movement, I deeply felt that the ideological remolding of intellectuals like me is not just a matter of studying Marxist-Leninist theory. It is necessary to actively participate in actual struggles, test and transform one's ideology in actual struggles, so as to constantly improve one's ideological level.

    Hu Kejin, Associate Professor of the Research Department of the Central University for Nationalities, said: I once had warmth for the Rightists Fei Xiaotong and Pan Guangdan, fearing that it would be bad to meet them after making sharp criticisms. Through this review, I removed my concerns and warmth, and will definitely more resolutely expose their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.
