    Reported by our newspaper: Through the training and testing of the anti-Rightist struggle, professors from various universities in Beijing have generally improved their socialist consciousness and have more trust and love for the Party. From interviews with our reporters and their reflections published in school publications, it can be seen that they deeply realize that they must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen ideological remolding, and better serve the cause of socialist construction in the future.

    Through this anti-Rightist struggle, many professors have further realized that the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the successful construction of socialism in our country, and they love and trust the Party even more.

    Pang Jingren, Professor of the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, said: I participated in this anti-Rightist struggle and deeply realized how dangerous it would be without the leadership of the Party and the victory on the socialist ideological front. When the Rightists were at their most rampant, it was the Party that guided me and kept me from losing my way. The reason why I was able to resolutely confront the Rightists in this struggle was also due to the education and strength the Party gave me. In the struggle, I realized even more profoundly how much a long-term bourgeois-educated intellectual like me needs to constantly remold his ideology. In the past, I always thought that I had undergone several movements and my ideology had been almost completely transformed. But this movement proved how inadequate I am in my ability to distinguish right from wrong and to distinguish between enemies and ourselves. I gradually recognized the reactionary nature of the Rightists, while the working class stood at the forefront of the anti-Rightist struggle from the very beginning, defending the Party and the direction of socialism. This movement has given me a good training and test, and I realize that intellectuals must continue to work hard to remold their ideology in order to stand firmly on the working-class position.

    Liu Ruozhuang, Associate Professor of Normal University, said that the Rightists gave us a vivid political lesson. Their purpose is to oppose the Party's leadership, because with the Party's leadership, we can be guaranteed to move towards socialism. They proposed that universities should be "run democratically," the purpose of which is to abolish the Party's leadership. If this attempt really succeeds, the heads of the schools will be Rightists, and then the school will become a reactionary group, which will reverse history and make it impossible to build socialism. Professor Yang Baochang said that the ideological struggle has made it clearer whether the Party can lead science. The Party can lead science. The reason why the Rightists raised this question was mainly to provoke scientists to leave the leadership of the Party. Secondly, they saw that most of the teachers in universities came from exploiting class families, so they looked for a market among them, trying to attack the Party in universities. It can be seen that it is even more necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership in universities.

    Xue Qin访, Professor of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, said that it would have been impossible to achieve the basic victory of the socialist revolution and the brilliant achievements of socialist construction without the Party's correct policies. In this anti-Rightist struggle, workers and peasants were the first to stand up and fight back against the Rightists, completely sharing the same fate and heart with the Communist Party, and their enthusiasm for supporting the Party and socialism was very high. This shows that the relationship between the worker-peasant alliance is very solid. The socialist revolution needs the leadership of the Party, and socialist construction needs the leadership of the Party even more. Today, anyone who wants to weaken the Party's leadership will be battered and bruised.

    Many professors believe that it is necessary to strengthen the training of socialist standpoints.

    Li Youshan, Professor of Tsinghua University, said: I have been trained in this stage of the anti-Rightist struggle. To fight against the Rightists, one must have a deep feeling for the working class, otherwise the struggle itself will lack strength. At the beginning of the anti-Rightist struggle, my ideological understanding was not very clear, and my position was not as firm as that of the working class. But when I thought of how the words and deeds of the Rightists were detrimental to the Party's leadership and socialism, and realized that my interests were the same as those of the working class, my combat effectiveness became stronger and more substantial. At the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the workers were very combative. This is because they have rich class feelings. They expressed their infinite love for the Party and socialism with extremely simple language and vivid facts, which gave me a very profound class education. I realized that only by learning from the workers and combining with the workers can intellectuals stand firm.

    Jin Ruixin, Lecturer of Beijing Normal University, said that intellectuals have always been rich in feelings and like to manage right and wrong, but why are they so slow, calm, silent, and even indifferent on certain political issues? When it comes to their own interests, we are often very sensitive, even suspicious; but why are we as dull as wood when it comes to the rampant attacks of the Rightists? We often argue and find it difficult to tolerate a sentence that wrongs us; but why are we so generous and even foolish when it comes to the big issues of right and wrong in politics? We often hate people who have conflicts with us to the point of gnashing our teeth and refusing to let go, right? But why are we so gentle with the Rightists who try to shatter the happy lives of 600 million people? This is a serious matter of position! Stand firmly on the proletarian position and feel everything with clear proletarian thoughts and feelings. In this way, we will no longer suffer from political colds and be able to analyze and treat all problems with a clear distinction between right and wrong, love and hate.

    Yang Zengwei, Professor of Beijing Normal University, said that the training of position requires a long period of testing. When the evil wind was at its height, it was the working class and peasants who first stood up to defend the Party and socialism, and they were the first to fire the first shot at the Rightists, not the intellectuals. Through this movement, I realized the meaning of "strong grass knows the strong wind." Therefore, intellectuals must closely align themselves with the Party, accept the Party's leadership, and stand firmly on the proletarian position.

    Yang Qi, Associate Professor of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, said that I was too naive politically and lost my political vigilance. I never thought that during the period of helping the Party to rectify, there would be Rightists who would take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, take advantage of the fire to loot, and attack the Party. But the most important and fundamental reason was that my position was unstable during the blooming and contending period, and I only stood firm after being trained in the anti-Rightist struggle. Learning to stand firm is the biggest gain I have made in this movement.

    Many professors said that they must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and continue to remold their ideology.

    Hou Renzhi, Professor of Peking University, said: The anti-Rightist struggle has completely shattered all anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies and exposed the Rightists inside and outside the Party. Without this movement, it would be difficult to imagine how to build socialism. On the other hand, the anti-Rightist struggle has also educated the broad masses, especially for us intellectuals, it is a serious ideological education. The facts revealed by the entire anti-Rightist struggle tell us that ideological remolding is the necessary path for us to enter socialism. If we ignore this point, we will be captured by bourgeois ideology and deceived by class enemies at any time and anywhere. If we abandon the leadership of the Party, give up our political demands, and ignore politics, we will inevitably make mistakes. After this struggle, as a scientific worker, I must make higher demands on myself, demanding that I consciously study and apply Marxism-Leninism, stand firmly on the proletarian position, and establish the red banner of Marxism-Leninism in my own field of scientific research.

    Zhang Yun, Professor of China Union Medical College, said that most intellectuals come from exploiting-class families and have received bourgeois education, and some have even studied in capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. Therefore, the bourgeois ideology of many intellectuals is deeply rooted. Although some people have changed after ideological remolding movements, there are still many people who have not changed their position, and even insist on a reactionary position. At the beginning of the rectification, I was not very clear about some issues. For example, I only thought that Chu Anping's remarks about "the Party's world" were too sharp. Why is my political sense not high? This is the issue of position. For intellectuals, to change their position, they must carry out ideological remolding, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and more importantly, participate in practical training to integrate theory with practice. Through this anti-Rightist struggle, the broad masses have been educated, and their ideological understanding has been improved.

    Zhou Zuoren, Professor of the Finance Department of Renmin University of China, said that in this fierce anti-Rightist struggle, I, an old professor in my sixties, like many intellectuals, received a very good training. At first, I did not have a very clear understanding of the anti-Rightist struggle. It was only after the disclosure of the Rightists' ulterior motives of anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies that I was greatly shocked. In the movement, I deeply felt that the ideological remolding of intellectuals like me is not just a matter of studying Marxist-Leninist theory. It is necessary to actively participate in actual struggles, test and transform one's ideology in actual struggles, so as to constantly improve one's ideological level.

    Hu Kejin, Associate Professor of the Research Department of the Central University for Nationalities, said: I once had warmth for the Rightists Fei Xiaotong and Pan Guangdan, fearing that it would be bad to meet them after making sharp criticisms. Through this review, I removed my concerns and warmth, and will definitely more resolutely expose their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

    北京高等学校教授谈在反右派中的体会
    立场问题是根本问题
    必须参加实际锻炼，向工人阶级学习，彻底改造思想
    本报讯　北京市各高等院校教授，通过反右派斗争的锻炼和考验，普遍提高了社会主义觉悟，对党更加信任和热爱。从本报记者的访问和他们在校刊上发表的感想中，可以看出他们深深体会到：今后必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，加强思想改造，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    通过这次反右派斗争，许多教授更加认识到党的领导是我国胜利建成社会主义的根本保证，更加热爱党和信任党。
    中国人民大学新闻系教授庞景仁说：我参加了这次反右派斗争，深深地体会到如果没有党的领导，没有社会主义思想战线上的胜利，将是多么危险。当右派分子最猖狂时，是党引导我没有迷失方向。我这次能够坚决起来和右派分子面对面地展开了斗争，也是由于党给我的教育和力量。在斗争中，我更深刻地体会到像我这样长期受过资产阶级教育的知识分子，是多么需要不断地进行思想改造。过去，我总以为自己经过了几次运动，思想改造得差不多了。但是在这次运动中，证明我对分辨是非、分清敌我的能力是多么不够。我是逐步认清右派分子的反动面目的，而工人阶级一开始就是站在反右派斗争的最前线，保卫党、保卫社会主义的方向。通过这次运动，使我受到了一次很好的锻炼和考验，我认识到知识分子必须继续努力进行思想改造，才能站稳工人阶级立场。
    师范大学副教授刘若庄说，右派分子给我们上了一次生动的政治课。他们的目的是要反对党的领导，因为有了党的领导，就可以保证走到社会主义。他们提出高等学校要“民主办校”，目的就是要取消党的领导，如果这种企图真的实现，学校的负责人将都是些右派分子，那时学校将变成一个反动集团，就要使历史开倒车，就不可能建成社会主义。杨葆昌教授说，对党能不能领导科学的问题，经过这次思想斗争就更明确了。党是能领导科学的。右派分子所以提出这个问题，主要是要挑拨科学家离开党的领导，其次是他们看到高等学校大部分教师出身于剥削阶级家庭，就在其中寻找市场，企图在高等学校中向党进攻。可见，在高等学校加强党的领导更为必要。
    北京地质勘探学院教授薛琴访说，社会主义革命取得基本胜利，社会主义建设获得辉煌成绩，没有党的正确的方针政策是不可能的。这次反右派斗争中，工人和农民首先站出来反击右派，完全和共产党一条命一条心，拥护党、拥护社会主义的热情非常高。这都说明了工农联盟的关系是十分巩固的。社会主义革命需要党的领导，社会主义建设更需要党的领导。今天谁要想削弱党的领导权，谁就会碰得头破血流。
    许多教授认为加强社会主义立场的锻炼很必要。
    清华大学教授李酉山说：这个阶段的反右派斗争中，我受到了锻炼。向右派分子作斗争，就要要求自己对于工人阶级有深厚的感情，否则斗争本身就会缺乏力量。反右派斗争开始时，我的思想认识并不是十分明确的，不是像工人阶级立场那样坚定，但是一想到右派分子的言行对于党的领导，对于社会主义如何不利的时候，认识到自己与工人阶级利害相同，休戚与共，自己的战斗力就坚强充实起来了。在北京市人民代表大会上，工人同志们战斗力很强。这是由于他们有丰富的阶级感情。他们以极为淳朴的语言，生动的事实，表达出来对于党对于社会主义的无限的热爱，给了我很深刻的阶级教育。我体会到知识分子只有向工人学习，与工人相结合，才能站稳立场。
    北京师范大学讲师金瑞莘说，知识分子原是一向富于感情而又爱管是非的，但是，为什么在某些政治问题上却又是那般的迟钝、冷静、沉默、甚至于寡情？涉及到自己的利害得失，我们常常是非常敏感，甚至多疑；而对待右派分子的猖狂进攻，却为什么又会钝若木偶？一句委屈自己的话，我们要常常据理力争，难以容忍；而对待政治上的大是大非，为什么那样宽宏大量，甚至若呆若痴呢？对待与自己有矛盾的人，我们不是常常会恨到咬牙切齿，不肯放松吗？而对待企图粉碎六亿人民幸福生活的右派分子却为什么又是那样温情？这是严重的立场问题！站稳无产阶级立场，以鲜明的无产阶级思想感情去感受一切。这样，我们就不会再患政治伤风病，而能够明辨是非，爱恨分明地去分析和对待一切问题。
    北京师范大学教授杨曾威说，立场的锻炼是要经过长期考验的。在歪风正盛时，首先起来捍卫党和社会主义的是工人阶级和农民，对右派放第一炮的是他们，而不是知识分子。通过这次运动体会到“疾风知劲草”的意义。因此，知识分子就必须紧紧靠近党，接受党的领导，站稳无产阶级立场。
    北京地质勘探学院副教授杨起说，我在政治上过于天真，丧失政治警惕性，根本没想到在帮助党整风时，会有右派分子乘机混水摸鱼，趁火打劫，向党进攻。但是最重要最根本的原因还在鸣放期间，我的立场不稳，后来受到反右派斗争锻炼才站稳了立场。学会站稳立场，是我在这次运动中最大的收获。
    许多教授表示，一定要努力学习马列主义，继续进行思想改造。
    北京大学教授侯仁之说：反右派斗争彻底粉碎了一切反共反社会主义的阴谋，揭露了党内党外的右派分子。没有这一运动就很难设想如何建设社会主义。另一方面，反右派斗争，也教育了广大的群众，特别对我们知识分子来说，更是一个严重的思想教育。整个反右派斗争所揭露的事实告诉我们，思想改造是我们进入社会主义所必经的道路，忽略了这一点，我们随时随地都会被资产阶级的思想所俘掳，被阶级的敌人所欺骗。脱离了党的领导，放弃了自己在政治上的要求，忽视政治就一定要犯错误。经过这次斗争，做为一个科学工作者，要对自己提出更高的要求，要求自觉地学习和运用马列主义，站稳无产阶级立场，在自己科学研究领域中，树立马列主义的红旗。
    中国协和医学院教授张鋆说，知识分子大多出身于剥削阶级的家庭，受过资产阶级教育，有的还留学英美等资本主义国家。因此，许多知识分子的资产阶级思想是根深蒂固的。虽然经过思想改造运动，有些人有了些改变，但是还有不少人没有改变立场，甚至坚持反动立场。在整风开始时，有些问题我就不太清楚。像储安平的“党天下”的言论，我只认为他提的意见太尖锐了。为什么政治嗅觉不高了呢？这就是立场问题。对知识分子来说，要改变立场，就要进行思想改造，要加强马克思列宁主义理论学习，更重要的，还要参加实际锻炼，使理论联系实际。通过这次反右派斗争，使广大群众受到了教育，思想认识提高了一步。
    中国人民大学财政系教授周作仁说，在这场激烈的反右派斗争中，我这个六十多岁的老教授和许多知识分子一样，受到了很好的一次锻炼。最初我对反右派斗争并不是认识很清楚的，那些右派分子别有用心的反共反社会主义的阴谋揭露以后，才使我大吃一惊。在运动中，我深深感到像我这样的知识分子的思想改造，不光是学习马列主义理论的问题，一定要很好地参加实际斗争，在实际斗争中考验和改造自己的思想，这样才能不断提高自己的思想水平。
    中央民族学院研究部副教授胡克谨说：我对右派分子费孝通、潘光旦曾经产生过温情，怕把意见提尖锐了以后不好见面，通过这次检查，去掉了顾虑和温情，一定更坚决地揭发他们的反党反社会主义言行。
