Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, September 9th: The "Our Word" newspaper published a statement from the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party regarding the situation in Cuba and the people's struggle against the Batista dictatorship.

The statement said that the current Cuban government is only able to prolong its existence due to the support of imperialist companies, large landowners, big merchants, and a portion of the treacherous elements within the leadership of the Cuban Workers' Federation, as well as the assistance of American weapons.

The statement then pointed out that it is very clear to everyone that the Americans supporting the Batista group, "seeing the inevitable downfall of the current government, are trying to control the change of government in order to allow a group of lackeys and traitors who are obedient to Washington and American monopolists and harm the interests of Cuba and the Cuban people to come to power." The National Committee pointed out that it is necessary to establish a broad democratic alliance and form a people's government with the participation of the country's basic political and social forces.

Havana dispatch: After fierce fighting with the troops of the dictatorial regime for an entire day, the rebel naval forces in Cienfuegos, Cuba, have withdrawn from the city and moved to the nearby mountains. A communique issued by the Cuban government on the 6th stated that government troops have retaken the city.

New York dispatch: An editorial in the "New York Herald Tribune" said that although the rebellion was suppressed, "the Batista government is facing even greater danger... The rebels are united in the struggle against General Batista's dictatorship."

    据新华社9日讯　塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯9日讯：“我们的话”报刊载了古巴人民社会党全国委员会关于古巴局势和人民反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权斗争的声明。
    声明说，古巴现政府之所以能够苟延残喘，只是由于帝国主义公司、大地主、大商人和古巴劳动人民联盟领导机构中一部分卖身求荣者的支持以及美国武器的帮助。
    声明接着指出，谁都非常清楚地看到：支持巴蒂斯塔集团的美国人“眼见现政府的下台已必不可免，便力图控制政府的更替，以便让听命于华盛顿和美国垄断资本家而损害古巴和古巴人民利益的走狗卖国贼集团中的统治者上台。全国委员会指出，必须建立广泛的民主联盟并成立有全国基本政治力量和社会力量参加的人民政府。
    据哈瓦那消息：古巴西恩菲哥斯城起义的海军部队在同独裁政权军队激战竟日后，已经撤出这座城市，转移到邻近的山中。古巴政府6日发表的公报说，政府军队已经重新占据了这座城市。
    据纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”社论说，虽然暴动被镇压下去，但是“巴蒂斯塔政府却面临着更大的危险……暴动者在反对巴蒂斯塔将军独裁统治的斗争中团结起来了”。
