Such a "Free World"
	No Money, No Vaccination
	A large quantity of polio vaccines are piled up in many pharmacies in the United States. However, on August 17th, 47 cases of polio occurred in Michigan, USA. The "Daily Worker" of the United States said that most of these 47 cases occurred in the families of the unemployed, because they could not afford the vaccination fee (US$5 per shot).
	Teacher Shortage, School Building Shortage
	Paris' "l'Humanité" recently reported that due to a lack of funds, French primary and secondary schools are facing a severe shortage of teachers and school buildings.
	It is estimated that in order to meet the most urgent needs of primary schools, France needs a total of 14,000 teachers with the necessary vocational education in 1957, but only 5,500 graduate from normal schools. In this case, France can only solicit applications from secondary school graduates, and if that is not enough, it must solicit applications from those who have passed the preliminary secondary school graduation exam, or even those who have only studied for three years of secondary school.
	"l'Humanité" said that many local school buildings are very old and can hardly meet the most basic hygiene standards. The situation in primary schools is like this, and the situation in secondary schools is even worse. The National Education Ministry's news weekly also admitted that some national and municipal middle schools are located in monasteries, barracks, private residences, and even in stables or hospitals. These buildings were generally built before 1914.
	Militaristic Teaching Methods
	There is a primary school teacher named Kummer in Saarbrücken, West Germany. He has developed a diversified system of corporal punishment for beating primary school students. According to this system, children aged seven to ten are likely to be beaten at any time and anywhere. Soiling notebooks and diaries will result in one slap on each side of the face, and not paying attention in class will result in punches and kicks. The punishment for shaking a chair is to put the chair around the neck and stand to listen to the class, and if you can't hold on, you will be slapped...
	Strangely, this method of corporal punishment that abuses children has not been stopped by the West German authorities, but is considered an outstanding teaching method for cultivating military reserve forces.

　　如此“自由世界”
　　无钱莫打预防针
    美国许多药房里堆积了大量的预防婴儿麻痹症的疫苗。但是8月17日这一天，美国密执安州却发生了四十七个婴儿麻痹症的病例。美国“工人日报”说，这四十七个病例大部分都是在失业者的家庭里发生的，因为他们付不起打预防针的费用（每针美金五元）。
    师资荒  校舍荒
    巴黎“人道报”最近报道，由于经费缺乏，法国中小学面临着严重的师资荒和校舍荒。
    据估计，为了满足初等学校的最迫切需要，1957年法国共需要一万四千名受过必需的职业教育的教师，可是从师范学校毕业的只有五千五百人。在这种情况下，法国只有征求中学毕业生应职，如果不足，就必须征求中学毕业考试初试及格者、或者甚至征求只念了三年中学的人应职。
    “人道报”说，许多地方学校校舍很旧很少能符合最起码的卫生标准。小学情况如此，中学情况更为糟糕。国民教育部新闻周报也承认，有些国立中学和市立中学设在修道院内、兵营中、私人住宅中，甚至设在马厩中或医院里。这些建筑一般都是1914年以前兴建的。
    军国主义的教学法
    西德萨尔布鲁根城有一个名叫库墨尔的小学教师。他制订了一套毒打小学生的多样化的体罚制度。根据这个制度，七岁到十岁的小学生们随时随地有挨打的可能。污损笔记本、日记本要挨左右耳光各一记，不留心听讲要挨拳打足踢。对摇晃椅子的处罚是将椅子套在脖子上站着听课，如果支持不住还要挨耳光……
    奇怪的是：这种虐待儿童的体罚办法，非但没有受到西德当局的制止，反而认为这是培养军事后备力量的一种杰出教学法。
