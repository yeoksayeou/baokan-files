Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st - At the fifth session of the First Hubei Provincial People's Congress, held from August 26th to 31st, more than five hundred people's representatives and observers comprehensively exposed and criticized some rightist elements among the Hubei Provincial People's Representatives and CPPCC members. The rightists' various arguments were thoroughly refuted, and their ugly faces were exposed before the people's representatives.

These rightist elements are: Ma Zemin, Dai Jinsheng, Zhang Yunmian, Lu Mingqiu, Liao Ruoping, Li Rui, Cheng Qianfan, Su Jicang, Zhu Yubi, Zhang Dao, Zhang Xichang, Lu Huabai, Lei Jidong, Ouyang Ping, Wang Yijiao, Li Zhaoji, Geng Bozhao, Yan Daogang, Yan Xunfu, Deng Jiesong, Pi Zongshi, and Zhang Yukun. They are all core rightist elements in Hubei Province. According to materials already revealed, many of these rightist elements have close ties with the core rightist elements of the central committees of various democratic parties. For example, Ma Zemin is the "commander" of the Zhang-Luo Alliance stationed in the Central China region. He formed a small group within the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Committees of the China Democratic League, vigorously recruiting for the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Ouyang Ping, Deputy Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, is a key member of the Zhang Bojun-Huang Qixiang-Li Boqiu group, claiming to be "a man in Zhang and Huang's pocket." Yan Xunfu, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, is a confidant of Chen Mingshu. Some rightist elements have consistently engaged in anti-Communist and anti-people activities before and after liberation; others are anti-Communist elements disguised as "progressive democratic figures." During the period of great blooming and contending, these core rightist elements used all kinds of malicious methods to attack the Communist Party and the cause of socialism.

At this session of the Hubei Provincial People's Congress, people's representatives from all over the province were divided into more than ten groups according to electoral districts, presenting irrefutable facts to debate these rightist elements. The rightist element Yan Daogang once spread the fallacy that after eight years of liberation, the landlords and rich peasants in the countryside have been "reformed" and they "should raise their heads." At a group meeting, Gao Jinlong, a peasant representative from Xiangyang Prefecture, refuted Yan Daogang with facts: "In Shiqiao Township, Xiangyang, a rich peasant killed two of our Communist Party cadres. They are already like this without being allowed to ‘raise their heads,’ how can we let them ‘raise their heads’!" Another fallacy of Yan Daogang was that rural Communist Party members are of "low quality" and "low level." Peasant representative Ge Changxiu used his personal experience to refute: In the past, when floods occurred, Kuomintang officials ran to high ground; now, when floods occur, Communist Party cadres run into the water. In our township, floods were common before liberation, and the Kuomintang not only ignored the victims but also took advantage of the disaster. In 1954, when floods occurred, county, district, and township cadres went to the front lines of flood control, risking their lives to rescue those who were flooded, and some even sacrificed their lives in flood control. Is this "low quality"? The representatives questioned Yan Daogang: Why are you engaging in malicious slander? It turned out that the rightist element Yan Daogang started his career by opposing the Communist Party. He once served as the director of Chiang Kai-shek's adjutant room in 1934, following Chiang in "suppressing" the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. In 1935, he was sent to the Northwest as the chief of staff of the "Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters." After everyone's refutation, Yan Daogang described his anti-Communist crimes as "subjective," "one-sided," and "sentimental" "errors." The representatives of the group, based on the materials revealed by the provincial people's representative from Hanchuan County, questioned him: This year you went to Hanchuan under the guise of "inspection," looking for old military and political personnel everywhere, inciting them to be dissatisfied with the Communist Party, and attempting to establish an anti-Communist base. Is this also a "subjective," "one-sided" error? Faced with irrefutable evidence, Yan Daogang had to admit some of his crimes.

The rightist element Deng Jiesong attempted to deny his crimes at the meeting and was also severely criticized by the representatives. At a group meeting, a representative pointed out: In 1947, Deng Jiesong served as the secretary-general of the puppet Wuhan Pacification Headquarters. At that time, in the "June 1st" tragedy at Wuhan University, the reactionaries used dumdum bullets to kill three patriotic young students and injure more than thirty others. Deng was responsible for this incident. Deng Jiesong immediately argued: "I was not in Wuhan at that time and I don't know about this." But a representative immediately produced materials proving that Deng Jiesong had personally said that he was in Wuhan at that time and knew the details. Deng Jiesong then lowered his head and remained silent.

The rightist element Zhang Xichang, Deputy Director of the Central China Agricultural Science Institute, once spread the fallacy that "the Communist Party cannot lead science and technology" and the "researcher-governed institute" concept. At a group meeting, Chen Zerong, Deputy Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Water Resources, who had been engaged in water conservancy work for more than thirty years, refuted this fallacy with his personal experience. Chen Zerong said: In 1931, the Yaodi breach in Zhongxiang County, Hubei, required only six million cubic meters of earthwork. The Kuomintang government mobilized 100,000 people and worked for two years; while in 1952, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, built in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, had a total of ten million cubic meters of earth and stonework and was completed in only eight months. Does this mean that the Communist Party cannot lead science and technology! He also cited two "August 19th" dates for comparison: In early August 1931, the Yangtze River embankment collapsed, and Wuhan was submerged in a vast flood. The Yangtze River water level collapsed before it reached twenty-seven meters. At that time, families were separated, and prices soared. On August 19th of that year, the Yangtze River water level rose to 28.28 meters, and the puppet provincial chairman He Chengjun even brought the affected women to entertain himself, calling it "using adultery to replace disaster relief." However, on August 19th, 1954, after liberation, the Yangtze River water level rose to its highest level in nearly a century—29.73 meters, but our provincial and municipal leaders were with the masses, fighting the floods day and night. The Yangtze River embankment stood firm, the citizens lived and worked in peace, and prices remained stable. Chen Zerong said that these two "August 19th" dates were personally experienced by the people of Wuhan and cannot be erased by the rightist elements' nonsense.

Many worker representatives refuted the rightist elements' fallacy that the Communist Party cannot lead science and technology with the magnificent scale of construction projects such as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, and with the fact that the lives of workers have improved since liberation.

During the meeting, the broad masses of people in Hubei Province and Wuhan Municipality also wrote letters to the conference to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of these rightist elements. During the general session speeches on the last two days of the meeting, the representatives systematically criticized the words and deeds of these rightist elements. After the representatives persisted in repeated reasoning struggles and fully exposed the various anti-Communist and anti-socialist criminal words and deeds of these rightist elements with conclusive facts, some rightist elements expressed their willingness to lower their heads and admit their guilt, confessing some crimes at the meeting; however, some rightist elements still attempted to muddle through, and were exposed by the representatives on the spot.

    真理战胜诬蔑  事实驳倒谎言
    湖北人民代表痛斥右派斗志昂扬
    新华社武汉31日电  8月26日到31日举行的湖北省第一届人民代表大会第五次会议上，五百多名人民代表和列席人员对湖北省人民代表和政协委员中的一些右派分子作了全面的揭露和批判。右派分子的各种论点被驳得体无完肤，他们的丑恶面目在人民代表面前暴露无遗。
    这些右派分子是：马哲民、戴今生、张云冕、陆鸣秋、廖若平、李蕤、程千帆、粟寄沧、朱裕璧、章导、章锡昌、陆华柏、雷济东、欧阳平、王一蛟、李肇基、耿伯钊、晏道刚、晏勋甫、邓介松、皮宗石和章裕昆。他们都是湖北省的右派骨干分子。据已经揭发的材料，这些右派分子中不少是与各民主党派中央的右派骨干分子有着密切联系。如马哲民便是章罗联盟派驻华中地区的“主帅”，他在民盟湖北省和武汉市委员会组成一个小集团，大力为章罗联盟招兵买马；农工民主党武汉委员会副主任委员欧阳平是章伯钧—黄琪翔—李伯球集团里的干将，他自称是“章黄口袋里的人”；民革武汉市委主任委员晏勋甫是陈铭枢的亲信。有的右派分子在解放前后一贯干着反共反人民的勾当；有的则是披着“进步民主人士”外衣的反共分子。这些右派骨干分子在大鸣大放期间，曾经用尽各种恶毒的方法来攻击共产党，攻击社会主义事业。
    在这次湖北省人民代表大会会议上，来自全省各地的人民代表按选区分成十多个小组，摆出铁的事实，分别同这些右派分子进行论战。右派分子晏道刚曾经散播这样的谬论：解放八年了，农村中的地主、富农都“改造”了，他们“应该抬头”了。在小组会上，一位来自襄阳专区的农民代表郜金龙用事实驳斥晏道刚说：“襄阳石桥乡一个富农砍死了我们两个共产党员干部。不叫他们‘抬头’就已经这样，还能叫他们‘抬头’吗！”晏道刚的另一谬论是：农村共产党员“质量低”、“水平不高”。农民代表葛长秀用他亲身的经历驳斥说：过去遭洪水，国民党的官员往旱地跑；现在遭洪水，共产党的干部往水里跑。就在我们乡里，解放前常闹洪水，那时国民党不但不过问灾民，反而趁火打劫。1954年闹洪水，县、区、乡干部都到防汛前线，冒着生命危险到洪水中去抢救被淹了的人，有的甚至在防汛中牺牲了生命。这难道是“质量低”吗？代表们质问晏道刚：你为什么进行恶意诋毁？原来右派分子晏道刚是以反共起家的，他曾经在1934年任蒋介石的侍从室主任，随蒋“追剿”中国工农红军，1935年被派往西北任“西北剿总”参谋长。经过大家的驳斥，晏道刚又把他的反共罪行说成是犯了“主观”、“片面”、“温情主义”的“错误”。小组的代表们根据汉川县的省人民代表揭露的材料质问他道：今年你到汉川借“视察”的幌子，到处找寻旧军政人员，煽动他们对共产党不满，并且企图建立反共据点，难道这也是“主观”、“片面”的错误？在铁的罪证面前，晏道刚不得不承认他的一些罪行。
    右派分子邓介松在会上企图抵赖他的罪行，也受到代表们的迎头痛斥。在小组会上有位代表指出：1947年邓介松任伪武汉行辕秘书长，当时武汉大学的“六一”惨案，反动派用达姆弹杀死爱国青年学生三人，击伤三十多人，邓对这件事负有责任。邓介松当场狡辩说：“那时我不在武汉，不清楚这回事。”但是当场就有一个代表拿出材料，证明邓介松曾经亲口说过当时他自己在武汉，并且知道经过情况。邓介松这才低头无语。
    右派分子、华中农业科学研究所副所长章锡昌曾经散播“共产党不能领导科学技术”，和“研究员治所”的谬论。小组会上，曾经从事水利工作三十多年的湖北省水利厅副厅长陈泽荣，以亲身经历驳斥了这种谬论。陈泽荣说：1931年，湖北钟祥县遥堤溃口，只六百万土方，国民党政府动员了十万人，做了两年；而1952年，在长江中游建设的荆江分洪工程，共有一千万土方、石方，只八个月就完成了。这难道说共产党不能领导科学技术吗！他还举出两个“8月19日”来对比：1931年8月初，长江江堤溃决，武汉市被淹没在汪洋大水里，长江水位还不到二十七公尺就溃了堤。那时，家家户户妻离子散，物价飞涨。那年8月19日长江水位涨到二八·二八公尺，伪省主席何成浚竟把受灾的妇女弄来取乐，说是“以奸代赈”。而解放后1954年的8月19日，长江水位上涨到近百年来的最高水位——二九·七三公尺，我们省、市领导人却跟群众在一起，日日夜夜同洪水搏斗。江堤屹立无恙，市民安居乐业，物价一直平稳。陈泽荣说，这两个“8月19日”是武汉人民亲身经历过的，不是右派分子胡说八道可以抹杀的。
    许多工人代表以武汉长江大桥、武汉钢铁联合企业等建设工程的宏伟规模，以解放后工人生活提高的事实，驳斥了右派分子的所谓共产党不能领导科学技术的谬论。
    会议期间，湖北省和武汉市的广大人民，也纷纷写信给大会揭露和批判这些右派分子的反动言行。会议最后两天进行大会发言时，代表们又系统地对这些右派分子的言行进行了批判。在代表们坚持反复的说理斗争，以确凿事实充分揭露了这些右派分子各种反共反社会主义的罪恶言行以后，有的右派分子表示低头认罪，在会上交代了一些罪行；但是有的右派分子还企图蒙混过关，当场就被代表们揭穿了。
