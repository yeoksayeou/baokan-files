Title: Don't Be Afraid of the Masses Offering Opinions

To carry out the rectification movement in rural areas, we must not only raise the ideological level of the masses, but also improve the work style of cadres. To achieve these two goals, we must first mobilize the masses to speak out freely. Without speaking out freely, we cannot thoroughly expose ideas and engage in debates, and ideological problems will not be easily resolved. Without speaking out freely, the masses cannot fully express their criticisms of cadres and their opinions on work, and we cannot thoroughly examine and correct shortcomings and errors in our work, and agricultural cooperatives will not be rectified well.

Now, more and more cadres at all levels understand the first meaning of speaking out freely—to solve ideological problems; however, many cadres do not pay enough attention to the second meaning of speaking out freely—to solve problems in work. Many cadres no longer worry that speaking out will cause "chaos" when it comes to the masses discussing ideological issues; however, some cadres still have various concerns when the masses offer opinions on cadres and specific work. Some people who have relatively serious shortcomings in their ideology and work style, and who have made mistakes in their work, worry that if the masses speak out, the fire will burn them and they will be unable to save face. Most cadres who work actively and wholeheartedly for the cooperative inevitably have some shortcomings and errors, and they are also afraid that the members will not be calm enough when offering opinions, and will focus more on shortcomings and less on achievements. As for a small number of people with bad character, who violate laws and discipline, and who are degenerate, they are of course very afraid of the masses speaking out freely. These large and small concerns are all obstacles to mobilizing the masses to speak out. If these obstacles are not eliminated, the rectification movement will be difficult to carry out.

Will the masses really be unable to distinguish between right and wrong or specifically "rectify" cadres when they speak out freely? We can say with certainty that they will not. The experience of many places that have gone through great debates can prove this point. In those places, the spontaneous forces of capitalism in the countryside were once rampant, causing chaos, and cadres could not hold their heads up. However, when the masses presented all kinds of facts and opinions and debated them according to reason, right and wrong were distinguished, and all evil and unhealthy trends were defeated. Since the majority of the masses can distinguish between the major issues of right and wrong between capitalism and socialism, why can't they distinguish between the merits and demerits of their own cadres, and distinguish between right and wrong within their own cooperative? Why would they specifically "rectify" those cadres who are loyal and wholeheartedly lead the way on the socialist road, making it impossible for them to "save face"? They definitely will not.

Many places have let go of mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, and the ideas of policies have been laid out, and opinions on cadres and work have been put forward. While helping the masses solve ideological problems, the leadership accepted the opinions of the masses, rectified and corrected simultaneously, and made self-criticisms of shortcomings and errors. The masses' confidence in the leadership has been strengthened, and they have seen the development prospects of the cooperative clearly. Not only have ideological problems been solved, but also the enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved. Under such circumstances, the relationship between the cooperative and its members, and the relationship between cadres and the masses, has been further strengthened. Even if the cadres have had some shortcomings and errors, it is easy to gain the understanding of the masses.

In Fujian Province, there was a cooperative cadre whose work style was not very good. Once, he angered a member, and that member slapped him twice (of course, hitting people is wrong. In speaking out freely, whether it is cadres to the masses or the masses to cadres, they should "use their mouths, not their hands." Whoever uses their hands is first in the wrong). However, when the cadres were re-elected, this cadre was elected again. He asked the member who had hit him: "Why did you hit me and then elect me?" The member replied: "Hitting you was to get rid of your bad work style, electing you is because you are enthusiastic about running the cooperative." This example vividly illustrates: we should trust the masses, and we should not be afraid of the masses speaking out freely.

    不要害怕群众提意见
    南城
    在农村中开展整风运动，既要提高群众的思想水平，也要改进干部的工作作风；要达到这两方面的目的，都需要首先发动群众大鸣大放。不经过大鸣大放，就不能彻底暴露思想，展开争辩，思想问题就不易彻底解决。不经过大鸣大放，群众对干部的批评、对工作的意见不能通通倾吐出来，也就不能彻底检查和改正工作中的缺点和错误，农业社就整顿不好。
    现在，在各级干部中间已经有越来越多的人明白了大鸣大放的前一个意义——为了解决思想上的问题；但是，许多干部还不够注意大鸣大放的后一个意义——为了解决工作中的问题。要群众在大鸣大放中谈出思想问题来，许多干部已经不再担心会放
  “乱”了；要群众在大鸣大放中对干部和具体工作提意见，有些干部却仍然有种种顾虑。一些在思想作风上存在着比较严重的缺点、在工作上犯过错误的人，顾虑群众鸣放起来，会把火烧到自己头上，使自己下不了台。大多数积极工作、一心为社的干部，也难免有某些缺点和错误，他们也怕社员在提意见的时候不够冷静，多看缺点，少看成绩。至于少数品质恶劣、违法乱纪、蜕化变质的分子，对群众大鸣大放当然十分害怕。这些大大小小的顾虑，对于发动群众鸣放都是障碍。这种障碍不消除，整风运动就很难开展起来。
    群众大鸣大放起来真会是非不清或专“整”干部吗？可以肯定地说，不会。许多经过了大辩论的地方的经验就可以证明这一点。在那些地方，农村的资本主义自发势力曾嚣张一时，闹得乌烟瘴气，干部曾经抬不起头来。可是，当群众把各种事实和意见都摆出来，据理进行争辩以后，是非辨明了，一切邪气和歪风也就打下去了。既然大多数群众能够分清资本主义和社会主义的大是大非，为什么他们会分不清自己的干部的功过，分不清自己社内的是非呢？他们为什么会专门“整”那些忠心耿耿带头走社会主义道路的干部，让他们“下不了台”呢？决不会的。
    许多地方放手发动群众大鸣大放，对政策的思想摊了出来，对干部、对工作的意见也通通提了出来。领导方面在帮助群众解决思想问题的同时，接受了群众的意见，边整边改，对缺点错误作了检讨。群众对领导的信心加强了，对社的发展前途看清了，不仅思想问题解决了，生产积极性也大大提高了。在这样的情况下，社和社员关系、干部和群众的关系进一步密切起来，即使干部曾经有过若干缺点和错误，也容易得到群众的谅解。
    福建省有个社干部，平常作风不太好，有一次把一个社员惹火了，那个社员打了他两耳光（当然打人是错误的，在大鸣大放中，无论干部对群众或者群众对干部，都应该“动口不动手”，谁动手，谁就首先没理了）。但在改选干部的时候，这个干部又当选了。他问那位打过他的社员：“为什么打了我还选我？”那位社员回答说：“打你是想打掉你的坏作风，选你是因为你热心办社”。这个例子生动地说明：应该相信群众，不应该害怕群众大鸣大放。
