(Reported by this newspaper) Since August, the CCP Guangxi Provincial Committees at all levels have adopted a method combining large-scale publicity with meticulous and thorough work, launching a massive debate on the two roads in the vast countryside. Through the debate, they severely cracked down on the arrogance of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, and criticized the capitalist thinking of the well-to-do middle peasants. The right-leaning thinking of the cadres has been reversed, the awareness of the broad masses of peasants has been raised, those who wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives no longer want to, and paying public grain has become a surge of enthusiasm. The face of the countryside has been completely renewed.

The development of this movement in Guangxi Province can be roughly divided into: first, striking at the attacks of illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries; second, carefully carrying out a large-scale debate, focusing on criticizing the capitalist thinking of well-to-do middle peasants; and finally, concentrating efforts on resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses. Currently, except for remote areas and a few parts, this movement has been universally launched in more than 70% of the townships in the province. Among them, Guixi, Rongxian and other regions, as well as parts of Yishan Prefecture, have shifted from the stage of counterattacking landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries to the stage of socialist debate centered on the grain issue. The movement is progressing smoothly, and the masses are satisfied, saying: "It should have been done this way a long time ago!" "This is what a socialist should look like!"

Before the launch of the large-scale debate, many rural work cadres only paid attention to economic work and neglected political work, so the struggle between the two roads in the countryside was still very sharp. Illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries stirred up trouble, spread rumors, murdered cadres, and engaged in counter-settlements. Some even intimidated peasants and cadres, saying: "Huang Shaohong is coming back to be the provincial chairman, how dare you control me! It's my turn to control you."

A small number of well-to-do middle peasants also spread remarks against collectivization and against the unified purchase and sale of grain, even openly instigating peasants to pull their cattle and withdraw from the cooperatives. In such areas, phenomena of exploitation such as buying and selling land, lending at usurious rates, and hiring laborers quickly emerged; at the same time, the free market also became rampant, seriously affecting the completion of grain requisitioning and purchasing tasks.

The broad masses of peasants, especially the poor peasants, are willing to take the socialist road. Some people were dubious about the rumors, saying: Will we continue to run the cooperatives? Is the Communist Party really leaving? Some went to the city with anxiety to see if the Communist Party was still there. Others were secretly preparing, if the "situation" really changed, they would fight the landlords and then follow the Communist Party into the mountains.

Many rural cadres were misled by the clamor of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. They could not see the true demands in the hearts of the broad masses of peasants, and mistakenly regarded the remarks of some well-to-do middle peasants as the ideas of all peasants. Therefore, they dared not righteously publicize the superiority of the cooperatives and the benefits of the unified purchase and sale, disarming their ideological defenses.

Based on the above situation, the CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee issued instructions in early August to carry out anti-rightist struggle education in rural areas, convened a series of meetings, emphasizing cracking down on landlord and rich peasant counterattacks, criticizing capitalist ideology, adhering to the Party's class line in rural areas, and carrying out the struggle between the two roads. This movement quickly unfolded in most areas. Generally, a propaganda offensive was first launched in market towns. As blackboard newspapers and radio stations in the countryside also became active, it greatly encouraged the broad masses of peasants and cracked down on evil influences. Subsequently, each township launched a large-scale debate by recalling and comparing the past and present, enlightening the peasants' consciousness. Many townships first focused on exposing the crimes of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and launched a struggle against them. Under this momentum, illegal landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements confessed their crimes one after another. The shouting of some well-to-do middle peasants also subsided, and some households who had withdrawn from the cooperatives asked to return. For example, many cadres in Zhongping District, Shilong County, originally lacked confidence when they saw some people making trouble to withdraw from the cooperatives. Later, after analyzing the members of nine villages, they found that only 7% were really making trouble to withdraw, and about 70% of the poor and lower-middle peasants were determined to take the socialist road, so their confidence increased. On this basis, each township also convened conferences of poor and lower-middle peasants by township, area, or village, absorbing upper-middle peasants who were willing to take the road of collectivization, and using specific people and specific events in their own township and village to carry out comparative education. After everyone's awareness was raised, the masses were then encouraged to conduct inspections: who sabotaged the cooperatives, who sabotaged the unified purchase and sale of grain, who sabotaged production. After preliminary inspection, in thirteen townships of the entire district, six landlords, six rich peasants, and seven counter-revolutionaries who had been leniently treated were found to have engaged in destructive activities. At the same time, some well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas also released an atmosphere of dissatisfaction with the socialist system.

From August 2nd, in every township and every corner of the entire district, the crimes of reactionary landlords and rich peasants were exposed. At the same time, nine out of the thirteen townships launched struggles against landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements who had counterattacked and sabotaged agricultural cooperatives. After the struggle, the reactionary and ugly faces of landlords, rich peasants, etc. were exposed, the evil trends and unhealthy influences were eliminated, and the face of the entire district was changed. Now the enthusiasm of cadres is high, and many peasants who had made trouble to withdraw from the cooperatives have also returned to the cooperatives after such education.

In most areas of the province, through large-scale debates, the crimes of illegal landlords in sabotaging the grain policy were exposed, and major issues of right and wrong were clarified. The broad masses of peasants quickly launched a surge of enthusiasm for paying public grain. Before the launch of this movement in the province, the grain requisitioning work progressed very slowly, and some areas were even in a state of stagnation. After the movement was launched, the number of completed grain requisitioning tasks in the province has rapidly increased from 17% in early August to 67%. Rongxian Prefecture has already overfulfilled the task. In Binyang County, in four days, the grain stored in warehouses increased from 2.3 million catties of rice to more than 11.58 million catties. In Xigan Township, Daxian District of this county, landlords spread rumors that peasants' lives were miserable because the grain was taken away by the government to support cadres and workers, thereby inciting members of three production teams in Jiangcun to resist the unified purchase and sale of grain. Some people who did not know the truth were affected, and even though the grain was dried and cleaned, they were unwilling to hand it over to the state. After the CCP Binyang County Committee guided the peasants to conduct a large-scale debate on grain policy, the peasants all realized the benefits of implementing unified purchase and sale, and knew that they had been used by landlords and rich peasants. Members of Lantian Cooperative said: We shouted with the enemy, that was too wrong. So the peasants seized the time to transport requisitioned grain every morning.

    坚持党的阶级路线，开展两条道路的斗争
    广西农村正气压倒邪气
    本报讯　8月份以来，中共广西省各级党委采取大张旗鼓与深入细致相结合的方法，在广大农村开展了声势浩大的两条道路的大辩论。通过辩论，狠狠地打击了地主、富农、反革命分子的嚣张气焰，批判了富裕中农的资本主义思想。干部的右倾思想扭转了，广大农民群众的觉悟提高了，要退社的也不退了，缴纳公粮形成了热潮，农村面貌为之一新。
    广西省这一段运动的发展大致是：第一步，打击不法地主、富农、反革命分子的进攻；第二步，细致地开展大辩论，集中批判富裕中农的资本主义思想；最后，集中力量解决干部与群众的关系问题。现在全省除边远地区和一部分外，这个运动已在全省百分之七十以上的乡普遍展开。其中桂西、容县等地区和宜山专区的一部分县和乡已由反击地主、富农、反革命分子进攻阶段转入了以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论阶段，运动进展得很顺利，群众满意地说：“早该这样做了！”“这才像个社会主义样子！”
    展开大辩论以前，由于许多农村工作干部只注意了经济工作，忽视了政治工作，因而农村两条道路的斗争还很尖锐。不法地主、富农和反革命分子兴风作浪，造谣生事，杀害干部，进行反攻倒算。有的甚至恫吓农民和干部说：“黄绍竑又要回来当省主席了，你还敢管我！该我管你们了。”
    少数富裕中农也散布反对合作化、反对粮食统购统销的言论，甚至公开怂恿农民拉牛退社。而在这种地区，很快就出现了买卖土地、放高利贷和雇佣工人等剥削现象；同时，自由市场也就泛滥起来，严重地影响了粮食征购和收购任务的完成。
    广大农民群众尤其是贫农是愿意走社会主义道路的。有的人对流言蜚语半信半疑，说：究竟还办不办社呢？共产党真的要走了吗？有的人怀着焦躁不安的心情进城看共产党还在不在。还有的在暗中准备，如果真的要“变天”，他们就对地主干一场，然后跟着共产党上山。
    许多农村干部被地主、富农和反革命分子的叫嚣迷惑住了，他们看不清广大农民内心的真实要求，而错把某些富裕中农的言论看成是全体农民的想法。于是他们不敢理直气壮地宣传合作社的优越性和统购统销的好处，解除了思想武装。
    根据上述情况，中共广西省委便于8月初发出在农村开展反右派斗争教育的指示，召开了一系列的会议，强调打击地主、富农反攻，批判资本主义思想，坚持党在农村的阶级路线，开展两条道路的斗争。这一运动迅速在多数地区开展起来。一般是先在圩镇上展开宣传攻势，随着农村中黑板报、广播站也活动起来，这样就大大鼓舞了广大农民，打击了邪气。接着，各乡就通过回忆对比，展开大辩论，启发农民觉悟。许多乡首先集中地揭发地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的罪恶，向他们开展斗争。在这种声势下，不法地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子纷纷认了罪。部分富裕中农的叫喊也收敛起来，有些退社户又要求回来了。如石龙县中平区许多干部原来看见有些人闹退社，信心不高。后来对九个村的社员进行分析，发现只有7％是真正闹退社的，70％左右的贫农、下中农是坚决要走社会主义道路的，信心就大了。在这基础上，各乡又以乡、片或村为单位召开贫农、下中农大会，吸收愿意走合作化道路的上中农参加，运用本乡本村的具体人具体事进行对比教育。在大家觉悟提高后，再启发群众进行检查：谁破坏合作社，谁破坏粮食统购统销，谁破坏生产。经过初步检查，全区十三个乡，即查出地主六人、富农六人、被宽大处理的反革命分子七人进行破坏活动，同时有些资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，也放出不满社会主义制度的空气。
    从8月2日起，全区每个乡每个角落都揭发了反动地主、富农的罪行。同时，十三个乡就有九个乡展开了对反攻倒算、破坏农业社的地主、富农和坏分子的斗争。经过斗争，地主、富农等反动丑恶面貌暴露无遗，歪风邪气被打掉了，全区的面貌就改变过来了。现在干部工作积极性高涨，许多闹退社农民通过这样教育以后，也回社了。
    全省多数地区通过大辩论，揭露不法地主破坏粮食政策的罪行，辨明了大是大非以后，广大农民迅速掀起了缴纳公粮的热潮。全省开展这个运动前，粮食征购工作进展很慢，有的地区甚至陷于停顿状态。运动开展后，现在全省完成粮食征购任务的数字已由8月初的17％迅速增长到67％。容县专区已经超额完成了任务。宾阳县在四天当中，入库粮食由二百三十万斤稻谷增至一千一百五十八万多斤。这个县大仙区西甘乡地主造谣说农民生活苦就是因为粮食被政府拿去养干部和工人了，以此煽动蒋村三个生产队的社员抵抗粮食统购统销。有些不明真相的人受到影响，谷子晒干风净也不愿交给国家了。中共宾阳县委引导农民开展粮食政策大辩论以后，农民都认识到实行统购统销的好处，知道自己受了地主、富农的利用。蓝田社的社员说：我们跟着敌人叫喊，太不对了。于是农民每天早上都抓紧时间运送征购粮。
