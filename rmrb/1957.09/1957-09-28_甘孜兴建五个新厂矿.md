    Five New Factories and Mines Being Built in Garze
    The Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province is building five new factories and mines. These factories and mines are: Kangding Lead Mine, Luding Mica Mine, Garze Farm Tool Factory, and the hydropower plants in Daofu and Luding.

    In the Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture on the plateau, there was almost no industry before liberation. At that time, the entire prefecture only had a small hydropower plant built in Kangding that was exclusively for lighting electricity. After liberation, the first batch of industries in the autonomous prefecture has grown up in the past few years. At present, there are mica mines, iron mines, wool washing plants, power plants, printing plants, etc.

    甘孜兴建五个新厂矿
    四川省甘孜藏族自治州正在兴建五个新的工厂和矿山。这些厂矿是：康定铅矿、泸定云母矿、甘孜农具厂和道孚、泸定的水电厂。
    在高原上的甘孜藏族自治州，解放前几乎毫无工业，那时全州只有一个修在康定的小水电厂专供照明用电。解放后，自治州的第一批工业已在过去几年中成长起来，目前已有云母矿、铁矿、洗毛厂、电厂、印刷厂等。
