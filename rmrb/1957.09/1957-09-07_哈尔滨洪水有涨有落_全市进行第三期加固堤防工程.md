Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 6th: This morning, from 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM, the water level on the Harbin river surface rose to 120.29 meters, exceeding the highest flood peak level of last year by 23 centimeters. Starting at 7:00 AM, the water level gradually decreased, and by 8:00 PM, the water level had dropped to 120.17 meters.

Today, 170,000 soldiers and civilians in Harbin participating in flood control began the third phase of the embankment reinforcement project. The second phase of the project was completed yesterday. The embankments in the urban area and some suburban areas have generally been raised to 122 meters, nearly two meters above the water surface. Flood control personnel carefully inspected the embankments section by section early in the morning. Rescue teams promptly dealt with more than twenty dangerous situations today, eliminating many hidden dangers in the embankments. The city's flood control department today transferred diving inspectors, electricians, and others to form a special engineering rescue team, enabling the timely rescue of many complex hidden dangers that occurred due to the continuous erosion of the embankments at high water levels.

    哈尔滨洪水有涨有落
    全市进行第三期加固堤防工程
    据新华社哈尔滨6日电　今天清晨三时到六时，哈尔滨江面水位一度涨到一二○·二九公尺，超过去年最高洪峰水位二十三公分。从七时开始，水位陆续下降，下午八时水位降至一二○·一七公尺。
    今天哈尔滨市参加防汛的十七万军民开始第三期加固堤坝工程。第二期工程已在昨天竣工。市区和部分郊区堤坝一般已加高到一百二十二公尺。超出水面近两公尺。防汛人员清早起，分段仔细检查堤坝。抢险队员今天及时抢救了二十多处险象，消灭堤坝的不少隐患。市防汛部门今天抽调潜水检查员、电工等组成特种工程抢险队，使堤坝在高水位持续侵蚀下而发生的许多复杂的隐患得到及时抢救。
