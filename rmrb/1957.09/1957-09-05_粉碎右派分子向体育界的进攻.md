    Smash the Rightists' Attack on the Sports Community
    Gu Ge
    During the rectification movement, rightist elements in the sports community, like rightists in other fields, launched a frenzied anti-Party, anti-socialist attack. These sinister individuals, from all angles, discredited and opposed the Party's leadership over sports work, negated the achievements of sports work, and opposed learning from the Soviet Union. They said that "90% of sports leaders are laymen," "laymen cannot lead experts," "the leadership of overseas competitions and sports meets are all monopolized by Party members," demanding to "abolish or reduce the Sports Commission, strengthen the All-China Sports Federation, and make the All-China Sports Federation a mass organization to supervise the Party and the government"; they said that "the genes of sports activities do not start from the people's health," "the guidelines remain on paper," "the Sports Federation and the Labor and Defense System are messed up," "martial arts are completely rejected," "forced promotion of broadcast exercises"; they said that "learning from the Soviet Union inevitably leads to dogmatism," and so on. They attempted to fundamentally shake and abolish the Party's leadership in the sports sector and drag China's nascent sports cause onto the capitalist road.

    In the past few years, the Party has done a lot of work in the political and ideological leadership of sports work, in terms of guidelines, policies, work plans, and cadre arrangements; and many leading cadres and Party member cadres have also learned and accumulated some professional knowledge and experience from their work. In close cooperation with non-Party experts, they have greatly developed China's sports and achieved tremendous accomplishments. Deliberately exaggerating "experts" and "laymen" is actually an excuse for rightists to attack the Party. The rightists' intention in demanding to "weaken the Sports Commission and strengthen the All-China Sports Federation" is extremely malicious. How the Sports Commission and the All-China Sports Federation can better cooperate in their work is a problem to be solved in future work, but it must not be said that the All-China Sports Federation does not need the leadership of the Sports Commission. The Sports Commission of China is a government department, and it accepts the entrustment of the Party and the state to lead the national sports movement. In the past few years, it was under the specific leadership of the Sports Commission that China's sports have developed rapidly. There is no reason to weaken the leadership of the Sports Commission. The All-China Sports Federation is a mass organization and must accept the leadership of the Sports Commission. Any idea or practice of being detached and independent is contrary to the national system. The rightists spread rumors that "the leadership of overseas competitions and sports meets are all monopolized by Party members," which is actually opposing political review and opposing political leadership. As everyone knows, the political review of personnel going abroad is an attitude of responsibility to the country and the people. It was so in the past, and it must continue to be so in the future. Moreover, in recent years, many international activities have been jointly participated in by Party members and non-Party members, and non-Party members sometimes outnumber Party comrades.

    The rightist elements in the sports community exaggerate shortcomings, negate achievements, describe the sports work of the past few years as useless, and distort facts to attack the Party's sports guidelines and policies as not being oriented towards the masses. Facts prove that this is a big lie spread by the rightists. The principle determined when the All-China Sports Federation was established in 1952 was: "On the existing foundation, proceeding from reality and combining with reality, to popularize and regularize sports, actively 'develop sports, enhance the people's physique,' and serve to strengthen production construction and national defense construction." The principle determined by the Sports Commission of the Central People's Government in 1954 was: "Combining with the actual situation, carrying out mass sports activities and gradually popularizing and regularizing them." In the past few years, sports work has continued to implement this principle, and mass sports activities have been carried out first in factories, mines, schools, troops, and government agencies. On the basis of extensive mass movements, efforts have been made to improve sports techniques. The guideline for 1957 was: "According to the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, on the basis of the work of the past year, strengthen leadership, improve quality, and further carry out mass sports activities and improve sports technical level." What facts can prove that these guidelines do not start from the people's health and are not oriented towards the masses!

    The rightists say that these sports work guidelines facing the masses are only "staying on paper." Please look at the facts. By the end of 1956, more than 30,000 factories and mines across the country had established sports associations, and nearly 80,000 people had reached the standards of various levels of the Labor and Defense System. By May 1957, there were 103 master athletes, 40,241 athletes of various levels, 156 national referees, and 15,447 referees of various levels. Major cities across the country and many factories, mines, and schools have established various sports institutes, colleges, and departments, and the number of graduates is more than the number of graduates in the 30 years before liberation; in addition, 300,000 to 400,000 grassroots cadres and activists have been trained. The number of sports books issued is 20 times the sum of the 33 years before liberation. These achievements are not only recognized by the people of the whole country, but also surprised many foreign guests who came to China to visit. Can this be created on paper!

    The rightists, on the one hand, falsely accuse that mass sports activities have not been carried out, and on the other hand, say that sports associations, the Labor and Defense System, and broadcast exercises have been messed up, and that "commandism is used to promote dogmatism." This is also a self-contradictory confession of the rightists. In the past few years, precisely because we have established sports associations and promoted concrete measures such as the Labor and Defense System and broadcast exercises to consolidate and improve mass sports activities, the nature and appearance of China's sports cause have been fundamentally changed, showing a new atmosphere full of vigor and vitality. This is by no means dogmatism. We did this in the past, and we will continue to do it in the future. The rightists say that the Party negates the national heritage and adopts a one-size-fits-all policy towards martial arts. This is a malicious slander that distorts the facts. When the State Sports Commission summed up and inspected sports work in 1954 in 1955, it discovered that people with ulterior motives used the name of carrying out martial arts to gather crowds to form societies, open halls to recruit disciples, develop secret societies, hide counter-revolutionaries, and do some ulterior things. Therefore, at that time, restrictions and bans were imposed on this aspect to prevent them from acting recklessly, and a more cautious attitude was also adopted. However, martial arts are still promoted as a sports item.

    The rightists oppose learning from the Soviet Union, and their purpose is to make China's sports move onto the capitalist road. This is absolutely not allowed by us. In the past few years, because we have resolutely learned from the Soviet Union, we have exchanged sports workers and athletes to conduct visits and competitions, invited Soviet experts to give lectures, trained instructors and referees, etc., which not only consolidated and developed the friendship between the people and athletes of the two countries, but also gained tremendous, selfless, and patient guidance and assistance in sports theory, teaching materials and methods, sports technology, and carrying out mass sports activities. The development of China's sports and the achievements made are the result of learning from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

    Another rampant activity of rightist elements in the sports community is that some rightist elements in democratic parties actively develop organizations, attempting to compete with the Communist Party. Take the "Jiusan Society" as an example. The deputy leader of a group led by rightist Lou Bangyan is a deputy section chief of the State Sports Commission. This person is usually not active in his work. Taking advantage of the Party's rectification movement, under the leadership of Lou Bangyan, he traveled inside and outside, actively engaging in activities. Within more than a month, he developed four members in the State Sports Commission. After the development, he immediately ignited the fire. They used big-character posters to attack the Party aggressively, as if the Party organization of the Sports Commission must give way, and the "Jiusan Society" was about to rise.

    Of course, the good dreams of these rightist elements did not last long, and their conspiracy to attack the sports community has been shattered under the counterattack of the masses.

    粉碎右派分子向体育界的进攻
    顾革
    整风运动期间，体育界的右派分子同其他方面的右派分子一样，发动了一次反共反社会主义的猖狂进攻。这些心怀叵测的家伙，从各个方面诋毁和反对党对体育工作的领导，否定体育工作的成绩，反对向苏联学习。说什么“体育领导干部90％是外行”，“外行不能领导内行”，“出国比赛和举行运动会的领导都是党员包办”，要求“取消或缩小体育运动委员会机构，加强体育总会，使体育总会成为监督党和政府的群众组织”；说什么“开展体育运动的基因没有从人民健康出发”，“方针停在纸面上”，“体协、劳卫制都搞糟了”，“对武术一棍子打死”，“强迫推行广播操”；说什么“学习苏联难免不教条主义”等等。企图从根本上动摇和取消党在体育部门的领导权，把我国新生的体育事业拉向资本主义道路。
    几年来党在对体育工作的政治、思想领导方面，在方针政策、工作规划和干部安排方面做了许多工作；也有不少领导干部和党员干部从工作中学习和积累了一些业务知识和经验，他们在同党外专家的密切合作下，已经使我国体育运动获得了很大的发展，取得了巨大的成就。故意夸大“内行”、“外行”实际上是右派分子向党进攻的借口。右派分子要求“削弱体委，加强体育总会”的用心是极毒辣的。体委同体育总会如何相互更好地配合工作，是今后工作中应当解决的问题，但是，绝不能因此说体育总会不需要体委的领导。我国体育运动委员会是政府一个部门，它接受党和国家的委托，领导全国体育运动。过去几年，正是在体委具体领导下使我国体育运动有了迅速的发展，没有任何理由可以削弱体委的领导。体育总会是群众团体，必须接受体委领导，任何超然独立的想法和作法都是违反国家制度的。右派分子造谣说，“出国比赛和运动会的领导都是党员包办了”，这实际上是反对政治审查，反对政治领导。大家知道，对于出国人员的政治审查是对国家、对人民负责的态度，过去如此，今后仍须如此。何况这几年来许多国际活动都有党内外人士共同参加，党外人士有时还多于党内同志。
    体育界右派分子夸大缺点，否定成绩，把几年来的体育工作说成一无是处，并且歪曲事实攻击党的体育方针政策不是面向群众等。事实证明这是右派分子撒的漫天大谎。1952年，中华全国体育总会成立时确定的方针是：“在现有的基础上，从实际出发并与实际相结合，使体育运动普及和经常化，积极地“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，为加强生产建设与国防建设而服务”。1954年，中央人民政府体育运动委员会确定的方针是：“结合实际情况，开展群众性的体育运动，并逐步使之普及和经常化”。几年来体育工作继续贯彻这个方针，并使群众性的体育运动首先在厂矿、学校、部队和机关开展起来，在广泛的群众运动基础上，努力提高运动技术。1957年的方针是：“应当根据中国共产党第八次全国代表大会和中共八届二中全会的精神，在过去一年的工作基础上，加强领导，提高质量，进一步开展群众性的体育运动和提高运动技术水平”。有什么事实可以说这些方针不是从人民健康出发，不是面向群众呢！
    右派分子说，这些面对群众的体育工作方针只是“停留在纸面上”。请看事实。到1956年底，全国有三万多厂矿建立了体育协会，近八万人达到了各级劳卫制标准。到1957年5月，出现了运动健将一百零三名，各级运动员四万零二百四十一名，国家裁判一百五十六名，各级裁判一万五千四百四十七名。全国各大城市和许多厂矿、学校建立了各种体育院、校、科系，毕业生比解放前三十年的毕业生还多；另外还训练了三四十万基层干部和积极分子。体育图书的发行数字相当于解放前三十三年总和的二十倍。这些成绩不仅为全国人民所公认，许多来我国参观访问的外宾也感惊奇。这是在纸面上能创造出来的吗！
    右派分子一面诬蔑群众性的体育运动没有开展，一面又说体育协会、劳卫制、广播操搞糟了，是以“命令主义推行教条主义”。这也是右派分子自相矛盾，不打自招的供状。几年来，正因为我们建立了体育协会，推行了劳卫制、广播操等巩固和提高群众性体育运动的具体措施，才使我国体育事业的性质和面貌从根本上得到改变，呈现出朝气蓬勃的新气象。这绝不是什么教条主义。过去这样做了，今后还要继续做下去。右派分子说党否定民族遗产，对武术采取了一棍子打死的政策，这是歪曲事实的恶毒的诬蔑。国家体委在1955年总结检查1954年体育工作时，发现别有用心的人利用开展武术为名，聚众结社，开堂收堂，发展会道门，隐藏反革命，干些不可告人的勾当，因此，当时曾对这方面加以限制和取缔，不准他们胡作非为，也采取了比较谨慎的态度。但是，对武术仍然作为运动项目继续推行。
    右派分子反对向苏联学习，其目的在使我国体育运动走上资本主义道路。这是我们绝不容许的。几年来，由于我们坚决向苏联学习，我们互派体育工作者和运动员进行访问、比赛，请苏联专家讲学，训练指导员和裁判员等，不仅巩固和发展了两国人民和运动员之间的友谊，而且在体育理论、教材教法、运动技术，和开展群众性体育运动等方面都得到了巨大的、无私的、耐心的教导和帮助。我国体育运动的发展和所取得的成就正是向苏联和其他兄弟国家学习的结果。
    体育界右派分子的另一个猖狂活动，就是有些民主党派中的右派分子积极发展组织，企图和共产党分庭抗礼。以“九三学社”为例。右派分子楼邦彦领导的一个小组副组长，就是国家体委的一个副科长。此人平时工作不积极，趁党整风之机，在楼邦彦领导下，内外奔波，积极活动，一个多月时间内，在国家体委发展了四个社员。发展以后，马上点火，他们利用大字报气势汹汹地攻击党，真好像体委的党组织必须让位，“九三学社”要扶摇直上了。
    当然，这些右派分子的好梦不长，他们向体育界进攻的阴谋，在群众的反击下已被粉碎了。
