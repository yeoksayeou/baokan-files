　　Thirty-Three Years on the Trolley
　　Jin Shou Shen
　　On December 18, 1924, probably a Thursday, the weather was very good. Although it was almost the winter solstice, it wasn't cold at all, and there was no wind. Because I was going to find a classmate to study "The Mozi Canon," I took a copy of "Mozi Jian Gu" and left home. When I got to the street, I was quite surprised. Why were there so many people on the street today? What were they looking at? It suddenly dawned on me that I had been oblivious. The newspapers had been reporting for the past few days that the Beijing trolleybus would start running today! How could I have forgotten! I also stood on the side of the road, watching the trolleybus. From afar, a cluster of bright light, like lightning, flashed, followed by the rhythmic ding-a-ling-a-ling of the bell. The trolleybus, like a small house, sped past in the center of the road. Everyone shouted in unison, "Look at the trolleybus!" That day, Beijing was as if it had some major event. From morning till night, the sidewalks were constantly filled with people watching the trolleybus. I boarded the trolleybus at Beixinqiao. Oh, it turns out the trolleybus was divided into first and second class! The smaller part of the car (one-third of the whole car) was first class, with soft rattan seats. The larger part was second class, with hard seats. I was sitting in second class. The second-class car was close to the driver's platform. I could clearly see the young driver, full of energy, driving the trolleybus and speeding forward. One stop after another passed. In the car, I heard two people talking. One said, "This number one driver isn't bad!" "That's right, young and strong!" From this, I knew he was the number one driver. After getting off the bus, I took another look at him. That day, I bought a five-small-copper-coin ticket. After getting off the bus, I casually clipped the ticket into "Mozi Jian Gu" (they didn't collect tickets back then. See the attached picture of the ticket). It has been put away for thirty-three years. Now when I take it out and look at it again, I can't help but feel emotional. That day, there were a lot of people riding the trolleybus, probably with the same mentality as me: wanting to try something new, taking a ride on the new trolleybus for fun.
    From then on, I became a long-term passenger of the Beijing trolleybus. As a passenger who rode the trolleybus from the very first day, sitting for more than thirty years, I have some feelings: Initially, although there were few trolleybuses, the ride was still smooth. In less than ten years, it became bumpy. Later, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the number of trips became fewer and fewer each day. It got to the point that in the spring of 1943, one day, when it was drizzling, there was only one trolleybus running on all the routes in Beijing. By the time of victory, only ten trolleybuses in Beijing were able to operate. The buses were also dilapidated. When they ran, they made a clanging noise and swayed from east to west. Someone said, "Why are the Beijing trolleybuses so broken down?" The driver gave a bitter smile and said, "We don't even need to ring the foot bell!"
    After liberation, there were more and more trolleybuses, they ran more and more steadily, and they were on time. I take the trolleybus to and from work every day. The trolleybus routes have increased to eight. Usually, each route departs every five minutes, so you don't have to wait for the bus at all. And there are also trackless trolleybuses now. It's truly convenient beyond words. I always remember the scene of taking the trolleybus for the first time thirty-three years ago and that young and energetic young man, the "number one driver." This summer, on a casual occasion, I heard someone say that the young man back then—the number one driver, whose name is Qian Xingkuan—is still driving the trolleybus. He is a first-class driver. And that, among the sixty drivers (called driver trainees before liberation) who studied driving in Tianjin before the opening of the Beijing trolleybus, only Qian Xingkuan is still driving. The other fifty-nine have been transferred or changed careers. These words stirred up many feelings and memories for me. If I could see that "number one driver," I would like to congratulate him properly.
    One morning after the Mid-Autumn Festival, I went from Chongwenmen to Tianqiao, taking the Route 7 trolleybus, the eight-wheeled car number 527. I still sat closest to the driver's platform, habitually watching the driver drive. Seeing that the old driver, although in his fifties, was still standing upright and driving with full concentration, I had a thought: Could this be Qian Xingkuan! The car started moving, and suddenly I heard the swish of the brakes. Listening to the crispness of the sound, I couldn't help but stand up and peek. This driver with bright eyes and a long face really looked like the number one driver I had seen thirty-three years ago. The car arrived at a stop, and I asked, "Comrade, is your surname Qian?" He nodded, "My surname is Qian." That's right, it must be Qian Xingkuan. I was overjoyed. The car arrived at another stop, and I asked again, "Comrade Qian Xingkuan, when do you have time so we can talk?" He turned around in surprise and glanced at me when he heard me call out his name, and said, "I can. I'll get off work when the car arrives at Tianqiao. We can talk then." He readily agreed to my request.
    We sat down and talked about the old days, and he was also very excited. He said with a smile, "I was only nineteen years old back then, how could I not be young and strong! I'm fifty-two years old this year!" I said, "Although you are over fifty years old, you are still as energetic as you were back then." He said with great emotion, "It's been hard to wait until today. To be able to drive the trolleybus for the people for a few more years is a great happiness." I asked him to talk about the changes in the Beijing trolleybus. He said, "Was the ride on the car you just took smooth?" "Very smooth, it doesn't 'shake the coal balls' anymore." He said, "It's not because my skills are good. It's because the roadbed has been repaired differently since liberation, and the tracks are also welded. How could it not be smooth!" Yes, I had heard that when the trolleybus tracks were first built, only a layer of eighty-millimeter gravel was laid under the rails, and only a layer of two-hundred-millimeter rubble was under the gravel. The joints of the rails were not welded. After a few years of operation, wouldn't they be uneven! I also asked him, "Are there more cars now than before? Are the cars better?" He smiled and said, "It's very simple, even a blind person can feel it! Didn't you say that there was a day when only one car ran in the entire city? That's true, but that's a true story from the past. Now, there are more than two hundred and ten trolleybuses running every day, and on festivals and holidays, it increases to two hundred and thirty or forty. During the factory and office rush hours, some routes add extra buses. How can this be compared to the past?" I said, "I think the trolleybuses are prettier than before." He hurriedly said, "How can you only talk about prettiness? First of all, the trolleybuses are all made by ourselves. Secondly, the quality of the trolleybuses has also improved. Didn't you see the eight-wheeled car I was driving? Didn't you see that the electric cylinder on the eight-wheeled car was cast with 'Type 52 Electric Cylinder · Beijing Trolleybus Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant'? Speaking of eight-wheeled cars, the numbers started with number 501. Numbers 501 to 506 were imported goods bought from Japan, and they still sometimes tripped the breaker when driving. Now, our own electric cylinders are so much easier to use!" As he spoke, he gestured with his hand, as if he was sitting on the driver's platform again, stroking the lovely electric cylinder. We also talked about the schedule of the buses, such as the circular route, which goes around Beijing city in a circle, stopping at thirty stations, precisely in seventy-five minutes. Now, the buses on all routes run on time. Talking about these things, Comrade Qian Xingkuan said very angrily, "In the past, where did the trolleybuses ever run on time? Who wanted to take the trolleybus? The circular route was tried three times without success. After liberation, it was successful on the first try. How much more convenient is this for passengers! Some people even say that the present is not as good as the past, even a blind person wouldn't believe that!"

　　电车上三十三年
　　金受申
    1924年12月18日，大概这天是星期四，这天天气很好，虽然快冬至了，却一点不冷，也没有风。我因为要找同学去研究“墨经”，就挟了一部“墨子间诂”，走出了家门。及至走到了大街上，却使我大吃一惊，今天街上，怎么会有这么多人啊？瞧什么的？原来，我一时是被蒙住了，实在，前几天的报纸上就登过：今天北京电车开始行车，怎么会忘了呢！我也站在马路边上，看起电车来：远远的一簇像闪电似的亮光一闪，跟着传来噹????噹???的有节奏的铃声，像小房子一样的一辆电车，在马路中心飞奔过去了，大家齐声喊了声：“瞧电车呀！”这一天，北京真像有了什么大事，从早到晚，马路旁边，始终不断瞧电车的人。我从北新桥上了电车，哦，原来电车还分头二等呢！车的少半部（全车三分之一）是头等，头等是藤编软席，多半部是二等硬席，我坐的是二等。车往南走，二等车正靠近驾驶台，我清楚地看见这个司机的年轻小伙子，精神抖擞地开着电车，向前飞跑，一站一站过去了，我在车里听见有两个人在那里谈话，一个说：“这一号司机不软哪！”“可不是，年轻力壮嘛！”从这，我知道他是一号司机，到站下车后，我还多瞧他两眼呢。那天，我买的是五枚小铜元的车票，下车后，顺手把车票夹在“墨子间诂”里了（那时候不收票。这张票见附图），一放就是三十三年，现在拿出来再看，就不禁感慨系之了。那天，坐电车的人特别多，大概都是和我一样的心理：想试试新，坐一段新电车玩玩。
    从此，我就成了北京电车的长期乘客。从第一天就坐电车的乘客，一坐三十多年，是有些感想的：最初电车虽少，行驶尚还是平稳的；没到十年，就颠簸起来了。后来，到了抗战时期，车次一天比一天少了。少到1943年春天，有一天，天正下着蒙蒙的小雨，全北京市所有各条路线上，只有一辆电车行驶；少到胜利的时候，北京电车能够行驶的，只有十辆了。车也破旧不堪，走起来，叮叮当当地乱响，东颠西摆地乱摇，有人说：“北京电车怎么这么破呀？”那位司机员苦笑了一下说：“这我们就不用踩脚铃了！”
    解放了，电车越来越多，走得越来越稳，时间又准，我每天上下班都乘电车，有轨电车增加到八路，平常每路都是准五分钟开出一趟，简直不要等车，并且又有了无轨电车。真是说不完的方便。我也始终记忆着三十三年前第一次乘电车的情景和那个年轻力壮的小伙子“一号司机”。今年夏天，在偶然一个场合里，听到人说，当初那个年轻小伙子——一号司机，名字叫钱兴宽，他现在还开电车，他是一级司机员；并且说，在北京电车通车前，在天津学习开车的一批六十名司机员（解放前称司机生），现在还开车的，只有钱兴宽一个人了，其余的五十九人，都调职或转业了。这些话，勾起我许多感触和回忆，如果我能见到那个“一号司机”，我要好好向他祝贺一番。
    中秋节后的一个早晨，我从崇文门到天桥去，坐的是七路电车，五二七号八轮车，我仍旧坐在离驾驶台最近的地方，习惯地看着司机员开车。看那虽然有了五十岁的老司机员，仍然挺着身杆、全神贯注地开着车，我心里一动：这莫不就是钱兴宽！车走起来了，猛然听到唰的一声关闸声音，我听了那个声音的率劲儿，不由地站了起来，探头一看，这个二目有神、长长的面庞的司机员，真像那三十三年前见过的那位一号司机。车到一站了，我问了一句：“同志，您姓钱吗？”他点了点头：“我姓钱。”没错了，准是钱兴宽，我高兴极了。车又到了一站，我又问：“钱兴宽同志，您什么时候有功夫，咱们可以谈谈吗？”他听我叫出他的名字来，惊讶地回头看了我一眼，说：“可以。车开到天桥，我就下班了，可以谈谈。”他豪爽地答应了我的要求。
    我们坐下，谈起来当年的事，他也很兴奋。他笑着说：“那年我才十九岁呀，怎不年轻力壮！今年我五十二岁了！”我说：“您虽然五十多岁，还和当年一样的精神。”他很感慨地说：“好容易盼到了今天，能多给人民开几年电车，就是很幸福的了。”我请他谈谈北京电车的变化，他说：“您刚才坐这趟车，稳不稳呢？”“平稳得很，再不‘摇煤球’了。”他说：“这不是我的技术好，这是解放后修的路基不同了，轨道也用焊接了，怎能不平稳！” 是的，我听说过，最初修电车轨道时，铁轨下面只铺了一层八十公厘碎石，碎石下面只有一层二百公厘块石，接轨部分，也不用电焊，走几年车以后，还不高矮不平吗！我又问他：“现在，比从前车多了吗？车好了吗？”他笑了，说：“这很简单，就是没有眼睛的人，也感觉得出来！您不是说北京有过这么一天，全市只出一辆车吗？这是真事，但那是过去的真事了。现在，平日每天行驶的电车，就有二百一十多辆，节日、假日更要增多到二百三、四十辆，工厂、机关上下班的时间，还有几条路线，增加班车，这从前能和现在比吗？”我说：“我瞧电车比从前漂亮了。”他急忙地说：“哪能光说漂亮？首先是电车都是自己制造的，其次是电车的质量也提高了，您没看我开的那辆八轮车吗；您没看那八轮车上电缸上铸着‘52式电缸·北京电车公司修造厂制’吗？提起八轮车来，编号都是五○一号编起的，五○一到五○六号，是从日本买来的进口货，开起来还有时候跳闸呢；现在，咱们自己做的电缸，多好使呀！”说着，他用手一比，仿佛他又坐在驾驶台上，抚摸着那可爱的电缸了。我们又谈了些行车班次的事，像环行路，绕北京市内一个圈儿，走三十个站，准准是七十五分钟；现在，各路班车，都是准点行车，谈到这些事，钱兴宽同志很气愤地说：“过去，电车哪里走过正点？谁愿意坐电车？环行路试行了三次都没成功，解放后试一次就通行了，这便利了多少乘客！竟会有人说，现在不如过去了，瞎子也不信哪！”
