Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: Former Syrian Ambassador to the United States, Zeineddine, accused US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson on August 31st of acting in the Middle East with the purpose of provoking Syria's neighbors to oppose Syria.
    Zeineddine exposed the American claim that Henderson's Middle East trip was a mission to investigate the facts. He said: If Henderson's true mission was to investigate the facts, he would have come to Syria. He could have come to Syria to see the situation in this country for himself. The fact that he did not come to Syria shows that his mission was not to investigate the facts, but to try to "turn neighboring governments against Syria."
    According to a United Press Washington dispatch: Authoritative sources said that in light of the development of the situation in Syria, the US State Department and the Department of Defense are "studying" the military preparations of countries such as Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan.
    According to an Ankara dispatch: Turkish Prime Minister Menderes received the former Syrian Foreign Minister Lian, who had fled to Turkey, on August 31st and held talks with him for twenty minutes. According to Western news agencies, two other former Syrian Prime Ministers are currently also in exile in Turkey.
    Arab newspapers have pointed out that an important part of the US-planned conspiracy to subvert the Syrian government is to collect Syrian reactionary politicians and seize the opportunity to support them in establishing a pro-Western government.
    The Cairo "People's News" warned the United States on August 31st that "Arab countries will take a unified stand against any country that interferes in Syria."
    An article in the newspaper said that if Syria is subjected to any military attack, Egypt will close the Suez Canal.

    叙利亚前驻美国大使揭露
    汉德逊在中东策动反叙活动
    埃报说阿拉伯国家将抵抗对叙干涉
    本报综合报道  据新华社1日讯：叙利亚前驻美大使宰尼丁8月31日指责美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊在中东活动的目的在于挑拨叙利亚的邻国反对叙利亚。
    宰尼丁揭露美国所谓汉德逊中东之行的使命是调查事实的说法。他说：假如汉德逊的真正使命是调查事实，他就会到叙利亚来。他可以来叙利亚亲自看看这个国家的情况，他不来叙利亚说明他的使命不是调查事实，而是设法“使邻国政府反对叙利亚”。
    据合众社华盛顿消息：权威人士说，美国国务院和国防部鉴于叙利亚局势的发展，“正在研究”土耳其、伊拉克、伊朗和巴基斯坦等国家的军事准备情况。
    据安卡拉消息：土耳其总理曼德列斯在8月31日接见了逃亡在土耳其的前叙利亚外交部长利安，并同他会谈了二十分钟。据西方通讯社报道，还有两位前叙利亚总理目前也逃亡在土耳其。
    阿拉伯报纸曾经指出，在美国策划的颠复叙利亚政府的阴谋中的一个重要部分，就是搜罗叙利亚的反动政客，伺机把他们扶植上台，建立亲西方的政府。
    开罗“人民报”8月31日警告美国说，“阿拉伯国家将采取一致的立场对付任何干涉叙利亚的国家”。
    这家报纸发表的一篇文章说，如果叙利亚遭到任何军事攻击，埃及就将封闭苏伊士运河。
