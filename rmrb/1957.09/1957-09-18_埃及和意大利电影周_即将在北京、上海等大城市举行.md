Egyptian and Italian Film Weeks
　　To Be Held in Major Cities Like Beijing and Shanghai

　　(Our Newspaper) News—The "Egyptian Film Week" sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of our country will be held successively in the three major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai starting from September 28th. The exhibition will feature four feature films and eight short documentaries.

　　The feature film "The Winds of July" depicts the story of the Egyptian Revolution of July 1952; "Struggle in the Valley" exposes the facts of the oppression of peasants by landlords before the revolution; "Our Beautiful Days" depicts the care, friendship, and love of several college students for an orphaned girl; "Life and Death" tells the story of a pharmacist who, because he dispensed the wrong medicine, was compelled by a sense of responsibility to find the unfortunate patient by all means possible. The documentaries include eight films such as "Happy Days," "British Troops Withdrawal Day," "Egyptian Oil," and "Industrial Renaissance." These films reflect the living conditions and spiritual outlook of the Egyptian people from different angles. Through these films, we can better understand the lives of the Egyptian people and recognize their ancient and beautiful culture.
