    A "Reputation" of Distinction

    Two months ago, clothing store owner Gluck was appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to Ceylon. This big boss made a complete fool of himself when he was submitted to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee for discussion and approval, because he couldn't even name the Prime Minister of Ceylon. This incident became an international joke and caused a minor uproar in the United States.

    Although he made a fool of himself, he did contribute money to the Republican Party's election campaign. So, this gentleman swaggered into office on the 15th of this month. As soon as Gluck arrived in Colombo, he brazenly told reporters: "Good, I can now pronounce the name of the Prime Minister of Ceylon." It is said that he spent ten hours a day at the State Department familiarizing himself with the situation in Ceylon. Although this is not as long as ten years of hard study, it is indeed hard enough for a clothing store owner. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that Gluck wanted to show off his ability and wipe out his previous shame as soon as he got off the plane. But, unfortunately, when Gluck recited the name of the Prime Minister of Ceylon to reporters, he still couldn't pronounce it quite correctly.

    According to American news agencies, Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike warmly welcomed the new ambassador. He said to Gluck: "Before you even arrived here, your entire reputation had preceded you." Bandaranaike also thanked Gluck for "the fame Ceylon has gained from this incident."

    The American "diplomat" Gluck was famous in Ceylon before he even arrived, and he was thanked as soon as he took office. Who can say that the U.S. State Department's method of selecting ambassadors is wrong? (Tang Qun)

    “声誉”卓著
    两个月前，服装店老板格拉克被任命为美国驻锡兰大使。这位大老板在被提交美国参议院外交委员会讨论批准的时候大出其洋相，因为他连锡兰总理的名字都说不出来。这件事曾经成为国际上的一个笑话，并且在美国引起了一场不算小的风波。
    虽然出了洋相，但是他毕竟是替共和党的竞选运动出了钱的。于是这位先生在本月15日大摇大摆的走马上任了。格拉克一到科伦坡就厚着脸皮向记者们说：“好，我现在能够念出锡兰总理的名字了。”据说，他曾经每天花十个钟头在国务院熟悉锡兰情况。这虽然比不上十年寒窗，不过对于一位服装店老板来说，也的确够艰苦的了。因此，格拉克在下车伊始的时候想逞一下能，以雪前耻，其心情完全可以理解。但是，可惜得很，格拉克在向记者们念锡兰总理名字的时候，仍然不能十分正确地把它念出来。
    据美国通讯社报道说，锡兰总理班达拉奈克非常热烈地欢迎了这位新大使。他对格拉克说：“你还没有到达这里以前，你的全部声誉就已经先你而来了。”班达拉奈克并且对“锡兰从这次事件中所获得的名声”向格拉克表示感谢。
    美国“外交家”格拉克到前就闻名于锡兰，并且一到任就受到感谢，这谁能说美国国务院选拔驻外大使的办法有什么错呢？　（唐群）
