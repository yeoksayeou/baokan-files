　　Resolutely Carry the Anti-Rightist Struggle Through to the End
　　For more than two months, the anti-Rightist struggle in the agencies at the provincial and municipal levels in Qinghai has achieved significant victories, and is now developing healthily in depth. During this period, some deeply hidden and disguised Rightists have also begun to be unearthed.
　　However, the struggle has not achieved a comprehensive and thorough victory. Although more than two hundred Rightists have been identified, the deeply hidden Rightists have only just begun to be unearthed. At the same time, the struggle on the ideological front has only just begun. Although the Rightists are completely isolated politically, their fallacies have not been refuted deeply, thoroughly, and completely, and have not been thoroughly bankrupt and isolated. Some middle-of-the-road elements have not fully recognized the reactionary nature of the Rightists' remarks. Therefore, to completely and thoroughly destroy the market for Rightist rhetoric, we still need to carry out a series of arduous, meticulous, and in-depth ideological debates. Facts have proven that some Rightists have not truly bowed their heads and confessed their guilt, and some are still playing tricks to resist or counterattack stubbornly.
　　Why do these phenomena occur in the struggle? This fully demonstrates that the reactionary nature of some extremely reactionary Rightists who hate the Party and hate socialism is extremely stubborn and cannot be easily changed. Secondly, it also shows that some of our comrades still do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of this anti-Rightist struggle as a political and ideological socialist revolution, a life-and-death class struggle, and they do not have a sufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of the struggle. Therefore, after the struggle achieved certain victories, a mood of relaxation arose; some comrades also showed a simplistic and impatient approach in the struggle, regarding the anti-Rightist struggle as something that could be "boomed" after a few intensive struggles, without being willing to engage in arduous and meticulous ideological and rational debates. They do not see the cunning of the Rightists, but only one-sidedly see the Rightists' false self-criticisms, and believe that the Rightists are already politically isolated, and that further efforts will only involve these issues. Among them, some individual comrades even treat the anti-Rightist struggle as an "incidental task." All of this is extremely harmful. These right-leaning sentiments must be resolutely corrected.
　　The facts of the anti-Rightist struggle in this period show that deeply hidden Rightists can only be exposed after the struggle deepens, the masses are mobilized, and there is nowhere for them to hide. Therefore, it is an extremely harmful right-leaning manifestation to still subjectively believe that there are no Rightists in one's own unit, and to not pay attention to mobilizing the masses and searching for and unearthing Rightists. This should be quickly recognized.
　　The struggle against the Rightists must continue to be carried out in depth, and it must be done deeply, meticulously, and ruthlessly. All units carrying out the anti-Rightist struggle must achieve the following: not only must the Rightists who have been exposed be discredited politically, but they must also be thoroughly defeated ideologically, and their arguments must be thoroughly refuted, so that all the masses can recognize their reactionary essence; units without Rightists should, based on the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of other Rightists and in light of the specific circumstances of their own units, launch a large-scale debate among cadres, thereby clarifying the line between right and wrong in the thinking of cadres, eliminating the reactionary ideological influence of the Rightists, blocking the market for Rightist rhetoric, and consolidating the socialist ideological position.

### 坚决把反右派斗争进行到底

　　坚决把反右派斗争进行到底
    两个多月以来，青海省市级机关反击右派的斗争已经取得了重大的胜利，现在正逐步向纵深方面健康地发展。这一时期中也开始挖掘出了一些隐蔽、伪装较深的右派分子。
    但是，斗争并未达到全面、彻底的胜利。目前虽然已查出了二百多个右派分子，但隐蔽较深的右派分子，还仅仅是开始被挖掘，同时，在思想战线上的斗争也开始不久，右派分子虽然在政治上完全孤立了，然而他们的谬论还没有被一一驳深、驳透、驳倒，还没有彻底破产和孤立。部分中间分子尚未完全识破右派分子言论的反动实质。因此，要完全彻底摧毁右派言论的市场，还需要我们进行一系列艰苦、细致、深入的思想大论战。事实证明，有些右派分子尚未真正低头认罪，有的仍在玩弄伎俩进行顽抗或反扑。
    为什么在斗争中会出现这些现象呢？这就充分说明了一些极端反动的右派分子，仇视党、仇视社会主义的反动本质是极端顽固的，不是轻易可以改变的。其次也说明了我们有些同志，对这次反右派斗争是一场政治上、思想上的社会主义革命，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争的重大意义仍然认识不够，对斗争的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足。因而，当斗争取得了一定的胜利之后，就产生了松劲情绪；也有些同志在斗争中表现了急于求成的简单急躁的做法，他们把反右派斗争看作是只要经过几次突击性的斗争，“轰”一下就差不多了，而不愿意去进行艰苦、细致的思想上、道理上的大论战。他们看不到右派分子的狡猾，而只片面地看到右派分子的假检讨，就认为右派分子在政治上已经孤立了，再搞也就是这些问题了。其中甚至有的个别同志竟把反右派斗争当作“附带任务”去搞。所有这些都是极为有害的。这些右倾情绪必须坚决纠正。
    这一时期反右派斗争的事实表明，隐蔽较深的右派分子，只有在斗争深入，群众发动起来之后，无藏身之处了，才会被揭露出来。因此，至今仍然主观地认为自己单位没有右派分子，而不注意发动群众，搜索挖掘右派分子的情绪，是极其有害的右倾表现，应该很快觉悟过来。
    反击右派的斗争必须继续深入地进行，切实做到深、细、狠，要求一切进行反右派斗争的单位都能达到：对已经揭露出来的右派分子，不仅要在政治上搞臭，而且要在思想上彻底打垮，彻底驳倒其论点，使所有群众都能认识其反动实质；没有右派分子的单位，应该根据其他右派分子的反党反社会主义的谬论结合自己单位的具体情况，在干部中开展大辩论，通过辩论从而澄清干部思想上的是非界限，消除右派反动的思想影响，堵塞右派分子的言论市场，巩固社会主义思想阵地。
