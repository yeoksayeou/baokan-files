Xinhua News Agency, August 31st, Paris dispatch: The Algerian Communist Party issued a statement pointing out that the current task of all Algerian patriots is to strengthen the unity of the National Liberation Army and the entire Algerian people, which is a necessary condition for achieving a decisive victory.

The statement went on to say that, because the United Nations General Assembly in September may discuss the Algerian issue, French colonialists are increasingly clamoring about the so-called "communist threat" and the so-called "split" in the Algerian national liberation movement. The statement said that participants in the liberation struggle, including members of the Algerian Communist Party, are currently united in the National Liberation Army for the same purpose. The members of this army include people from all social strata, regardless of their political views.

Xinhua News Agency, September 1st dispatch: French Foreign Minister Pinay, at a press conference in Santiago on August 31st, vowed that France would suppress the Algerian national liberation movement "indefinitely." He said, "France has the ability to continue fighting the nationalists indefinitely."

Pinay's visit to Latin American countries this time is aimed at wooing these countries to support France in the United Nations. (Attached picture)

    比诺扬言要实行“无限期”镇压
    据新华社1日讯  塔斯社巴黎8月31日消息：阿尔及利亚共产党发表声明，指出目前阿尔及利亚一切爱国者的任务是加强民族解放军和全体阿尔及利亚人民的团结，这是取得决定性胜利的必要条件。
    声明接着说，由于在9月间举行的联合国大会上可能讨论阿尔及利亚问题，法国殖民主义者正越来越频繁地叫嚷所谓“共产主义威胁”和所谓阿尔及利亚民族解放运动存在“分裂”现象。声明说，解放斗争的参加者，包括阿尔及利亚共产党人在内，目前都为着同一的目的而团结在民族解放军里。这支军队的成员包括来自一切社会阶层的人，不论他们的政治观点如何。
    据新华社1日讯  法国外交部长比诺8月31日在圣地亚哥的一次记者招待会上，扬言法国要“无限期地”镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。他说，“法国有能力无限期地继续对民族主义分子作战”。
    比诺这次去拉丁美洲各国访问的目的是拉拢这些国家在联合国中支持法国。（附图片）
