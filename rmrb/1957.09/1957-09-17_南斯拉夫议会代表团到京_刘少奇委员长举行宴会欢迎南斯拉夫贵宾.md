They were warmly welcomed by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and people from all walks of life in the capital.

The delegation is visiting China on a friendly visit at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the airport, extending a warm welcome to the distinguished guests. He said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Yugoslavia, the friendly relations between the two countries have greatly developed. Frequent cultural exchanges, trade contacts, and mutual visits by various delegations have enhanced mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the peoples of the two countries.

Liu Shaoqi said that he believes that this visit by the delegation will definitely help further consolidate and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples.

President Stambolic then spoke. He said that he believes that in direct contact with the representatives of the Chinese people, they will be able to expand and strengthen the increasingly broad and fruitful relations between the two socialist countries of Yugoslavia and China.

Stambolic said: "We are deeply convinced that the talks and meetings we will hold with you here will greatly contribute to mutual understanding. Without a doubt, this is not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also to further social progress, peace, and international cooperation in the world. And this is precisely the purpose of our visit."

Also present at the airport to welcome the distinguished guests today were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, as well as members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, heads of the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, and representatives in Beijing from the National People's Congress delegation that visited Yugoslavia.

Yugoslav Ambassador to China Popovic and embassy staff also went to the airport to welcome them.

More than 600 people went to the airport to welcome them.

Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: Chairman Liu Shaoqi held a banquet tonight to welcome the delegation from the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia headed by Petar Stambolic.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the banquet. On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people, he extended a warm welcome to the envoys of the Yugoslav people.

He said that the hardworking and brave Yugoslav people have a glorious revolutionary tradition. He spoke of the heroic anti-fascist struggle carried out by the Yugoslav people under the leadership of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and anti-fascist forces around the world, and the achievements made by the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia in the restoration of the national economy and the construction of socialism after the establishment of the Federal People's Republic.

Liu Shaoqi also said that the Yugoslav people have always supported the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan, and have made beneficial contributions to the cause of easing international tensions and promoting international cooperation. The Chinese people welcome the achievements made by the Yugoslav people in socialist construction and the contributions made in international affairs.

Liu Shaoqi said: The Chinese people deeply know that the unity of socialist countries is the basic guarantee for maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress. We will always be with all fraternal countries and strive to continuously strengthen the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese and Yugoslav peoples have a long-standing and profound brotherly friendship, which was forged in the common struggle against fascist aggression and has been developed in the common cause of building socialism. In January of this year, our National People's Congress delegation visited Yugoslavia and received a warm welcome. A few days ago, we welcomed Comrade Vukmanovic, Vice President of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia. Now, we are welcoming the delegation from the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia headed by Comrade Stambolic with brotherly feelings. We firmly believe that through the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations between China and Yugoslavia, the friendship between the people of the two countries will be deepened and mutual understanding will be strengthened.

Liu Shaoqi said that he hopes that in the course of your visit, in addition to seeing the achievements in our work, you will also see the shortcomings in our work, and put forward criticisms and suggestions.

President Petar Stambolic then spoke. He expressed his gratitude to the host on behalf of the delegation. He said: We are particularly pleased to have the opportunity to once again have direct personal contact with the representatives of the friendly and fraternal Chinese people, and to exchange views and experiences with them. He said that this visit will give us the best opportunity to learn more and more fully about the development of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and to understand the efforts made and the achievements made by the Chinese people now.

He praised the Chinese people for effectively solving the historical tasks facing them - eliminating imperialist enslavement and striving for independence, and steadfastly embarking on the path of socialist development under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. He pointed out that the victory of this struggle of the Chinese people has greatly weakened the forces of imperialism worldwide. This is a great contribution of the Chinese people in the modern historical development.

He also said that the Chinese people have been able to control their own destiny and formulate policies based on their own interests. This is in line with the interests of peace and the equal and active cooperation of all peoples. The victory of the Chinese revolution is of great historical significance to world peace and progress.

He said that the heroic struggle of the Chinese people is also the struggle of the Yugoslav people, because we have also shed blood for the same ideals, the same national and social aspirations of progressive humanity. Although the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia live on the other side of the world and in a different historical context, the people of all ethnic groups in socialist Yugoslavia have always rejoiced in the victory of the Chinese people.

Petar Stambolic said: The common revolutionary history is undoubtedly a solid foundation for the friendship between our two peoples. At present, the socialist construction of our two countries is bringing us closer and closer. The common and sincere desire to maintain and strengthen world peace also unites us together. Like you, we are treating this basic issue on the principles of active peaceful coexistence. Our common socialist goals and our sincere desire for peace make us constantly strengthen cooperation and exchange experiences. In this regard, the possible differences in the treatment of certain issues are only a logical phenomenon of the different special conditions of our two countries. But this cannot and will not hinder our cooperation.

He said that the Yugoslav people believe that the correct resolution of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is not only to meet the just demands of the Chinese people, but also to make a major contribution to peace and international cooperation. Therefore, our country will continue to strive for a rational solution to this issue in the future. The Yugoslav people also support the indisputable right of the Chinese people to return Taiwan to the motherland.

Stambolic also said: The friendly cooperation between our two countries is developing according to our possibilities, and we can feel quite satisfied, but more can and needs to be done in the future. He particularly pointed out that the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations of the two countries have special significance in cooperation. He hopes that this visit of the delegation will be able to inherit and consolidate this beneficial matter.

Yugoslav Ambassador to China Popovic was invited to attend tonight's banquet.

Also present at tonight's banquet were Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Shen Junru, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, and members, Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo, Secretary General Xi Zhongxun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, heads of various people's organizations, and well-known people from all walks of life.

    据新华社16日讯　以南斯拉夫联邦国民议会主席彼得·斯坦鲍利奇为首的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国联邦国民议会代表团今天下午乘专机到达北京，受到刘少奇委员长和首都各界人士的热烈欢迎。
    代表团是应全国人民代表大会常务委员会的邀请来中国进行友好访问的。
    刘少奇委员长在机场讲话，向贵宾们表示热烈欢迎。他说，在中南两国建立邦交以后，两国之间的友好关系有了很大的发展。频繁的文化交流、贸易来往和各种代表团的相互访问，增进了两国人民的相互了解和友好合作。
    刘少奇说，他相信代表团的这次访问，必将有助于中南两国人民友谊的进一步巩固和发展。
    斯坦鲍利奇主席接着讲话。他说，他相信他们在和中国人民的代表的直接接触中，将能扩大和加强南中两个社会主义国家之间的越来越广泛和越来越富有成果的关系。
    斯坦鲍利奇说：“我们深信，我们将和你们在这里举行的会谈和会议一定能大大有助于相互的谅解。毫无疑问，这不仅仅对我们两国人民来说是有益的，而且对全世界进一步的社会进步、和平和国际合作来说也是有益的。而这正是我们此次访问的目的。”
    今天到机场迎候贵宾的还有副委员长李济深、黄炎培、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通，副总理薄一波，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、北京市人民委员会、各民主党派和各人民团体的负责人，以及访问过南斯拉夫的全国人民代表大会代表团中的在京代表。
    南斯拉夫驻中国大使波波维奇和使馆人员也到机场欢迎。
    到机场欢迎的共有六百多人。
    据新华社16日讯　刘少奇委员长今天晚上举行宴会，欢迎以彼得·斯坦鲍利奇为首的南斯拉夫联邦国民议会代表团。
    刘少奇委员长在宴会上讲话。他代表全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民，向南斯拉夫人民的使者表示热烈的欢迎。
    他说，勤劳勇敢的南斯拉夫人民是具有光荣的革命传统的。他谈到了南斯拉夫人民在南斯拉夫共产党的领导下，在苏联和全世界反法西斯势力的援助下，所进行的反法西斯的英勇斗争，以及南斯拉夫各族人民在联邦人民共和国建立后在国民经济的恢复工作和社会主义的建设工作方面所获得的成就。
    刘少奇又说，南斯拉夫人民一贯支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利和行使对台湾的主权，并且在缓和国际紧张局势和促进国际合作的事业中作出了有益的贡献。中国人民对南斯拉夫人民在社会主义建设中取得的成就和在国际事务中作出的贡献表示欢迎。
    刘少奇说：中国人民深知，社会主义各国的团结是维护世界和平和发展人类进步事业的基本保障，我们将永远和各兄弟国家在一起，为不断加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结而努力。中国人民和南斯拉夫人民长久以来就存在着兄弟般的深厚友谊，这种友谊是我们两国人民在反对法西斯侵略的共同斗争中结成的，并且在建设社会主义的共同事业中得到了发展。今年一月间，我们全国人民代表大会代表团访问了南斯拉夫，受到了热烈的欢迎。几天以前，我们欢迎了南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇同志，现在我们又以兄弟般的心情欢迎以斯坦鲍利奇同志为首的南斯拉夫联邦国民议会代表团。我们深信，通过中南两国议会代表团的相互访问，一定会加深两国人民的友谊和加强相互之间的了解。
    刘少奇说，希望你们在参观访问中看到我们工作上的成绩之外，也看到我们工作上的缺点，并且提出批评和意见。
    彼得·斯坦鲍利奇主席接着讲话。他代表代表团向主人表示感谢。他说：我们有机会再一次与友好的和兄弟的中国的人民代表们进行直接的个人接触，并和他们交换意见和经验，感到特别高兴。他说，这次访问将给我们以最好的机会来更多、更充分地了解中国人民革命斗争的发展，并了解中国人民现在所作的努力和已取得的成就。
    他盛赞中国人民在共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，有成效地解决了他们面临的历史任务——消除帝国主义奴役，和争取独立，以及坚定地走上社会主义发展的道路。他指出，中国人民这种斗争的胜利，使帝国主义的势力在世界范围内大大削弱了。这是中国人民在近代历史发展中的伟大贡献。
    他又说，中国人民已经能够掌握自己的命运并根据本身的利益制定政策。这是符合于和平和各国人民平等和积极合作的利益的。中国革命的胜利，对世界和平和进步具有巨大的历史意义。
    他说，中国人民英勇的斗争，也是南斯拉夫人民的斗争，因为我们也曾为进步人类同样的理想，同样的民族和社会愿望流过血。尽管南斯拉夫各族人民处在世界的另一端并在另一种历史条件下生活，但是社会主义的南斯拉夫各族人民一直为中国人民的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    彼得·斯坦鲍利奇说：共同的革命的历史无疑是我们两国人民友谊的牢固基础，当前，我们两国的社会主义建设使我们愈益亲近。维护和加强世界和平的共同和真诚的愿望，也把我们联结在一起。我们正同你们一样，是在积极和平共处的原则上对待这个基本问题的。我们对共同的社会主义目的和对和平的真诚愿望，使我们不断地加强合作和交流经验。在这方面对待某些问题所可能出现的分歧，只不过是我们两国不同的特殊条件的合乎逻辑的现象而已。但是这不可能也不会妨碍我们的合作。
    他表示，南斯拉夫人民相信，中华人民共和国在联合国代表权的正确解决，不仅是满足中国人民的正义要求，而且是对和平和国际合作的重大贡献。因此我们国家今后将努力争取这一问题的合理解决。南斯拉夫人民同样支持中国人民将台湾收归祖国的不容置辩的权利。
    斯坦鲍利奇又谈到：我们两国的友好合作正在根据我们的可能发展着，我们可以感到相当满意，但是今后可能而且需要作得更多些。他特别指出，两国议会代表团的相互访问，在合作中有着特别的意义。他希望代表团这次访问将能继承和巩固这一有益的事情。
    南斯拉夫驻中国大使波波维奇应邀出席了今晚宴会。
    出席今晚宴会的，有林伯渠、沈钧儒、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通副委员长和委员们，国务院副总理薄一波、秘书长习仲勋，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，各人民团体负责人和各界著名人士。
