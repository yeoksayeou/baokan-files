Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st - The organizations directly under the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee have already resolved four thousand out of the more than eighteen thousand criticisms and suggestions made by staff during the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending. More than two thousand eight hundred others have proposed improvement plans and are in the process of being resolved. Everyone has reacted well to this method of rectifying while correcting.

The vast majority of organizations directly under the Provincial People's Committee have established special institutions and assigned full-time cadres to be responsible for handling the criticisms and suggestions made by the masses. At present, most of the criticisms and suggestions concerning welfare, institutional work systems, the work style of cadres, and leftover issues from the suppression of counter-revolutionaries have been handled and the problems resolved. According to statistics from fifty organizations, after accepting the opinions of the masses and adjusting housing, leading cadres gave up a total of 133 rooms. Additionally, 333 dilapidated houses were repaired, solving the housing problems of 1,165 cadres and their families. Twenty-eight organizations, including the Department of Agriculture and the Maritime Transport Bureau, have also improved meals and the hygiene facilities of their canteens. They have also adopted a system of mobile meal tickets to eliminate the phenomenon of queuing when buying meals. The road for transporting oil drums at the Commercial Department's oil storage depot used to be very dilapidated, and workers had complaints. Now, the unit has allocated funds to repair the road, much to the delight of the workers. The Civil Engineering and Architectural School of the Urban Construction Bureau promptly addressed the reasonable requests made by students, adding benches for eating, clothes drying racks, and refrigerators for frozen meat in the kitchen, and making every effort to solve students' dormitory problems. The students were very moved to see that the leadership was seriously addressing their opinions. Students who had been misled by rightists during the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending have also severed ties with the rightists.

There have also been improvements in the work system. Many units have improved the meeting system and cancelled some unnecessary meetings. The Provincial People's Court and the Forestry Department have implemented a system where Party member cadres receive the masses on Wednesday and Friday afternoons. After listening to the opinions of the masses, the director of the Supervision Department reallocated work, closely contacted subordinate cadres, and the relationship between leaders and the masses has markedly changed recently. The backlog and dragging of cases of citizen complaints that occurred in the past is also being actively improved.

    广东省人委直属机关
    几千条批评建议已作处理
    新华社广州21日电　广东省人民委员会直属机关对机关工作人员在大鸣大放期间提出的一万八千多条批评和建议，有四千条现在已经解决，有二千八百多条已经提出改进方案正在解决。大家对这样边整边改反映很好。
    省人民委员会的绝大多数直属单位都建立专门机构，配备专职干部，来负责处理群众提出的批评、建议。目前有关生活福利、机关工作制度、干部工作作风和肃反遗留问题等方面的批评和建议，大部分已经处理，问题得到了解决。据五十个单位的统计，接受群众意见作了房屋调整以后，机关负责干部共让出一百三十三间房子，另外修理了破漏房屋三百三十三间，一共解决了一千一百六十五个干部和家属的住房问题。农业厅、海运局等二十八个单位还改善伙食和食堂的卫生设备，采取流动售饭票的办法消除了买饭时排队的现象。商业厅储油所搬运油桶的马路过去很破烂，工人有意见，现在这个单位已拨款把马路修理好，工人们很高兴。城市建设局土木建筑学校及时处理学生们提出的合理要求，添置了吃饭坐的凳子、晒衣架、厨房用的冻肉箱，并尽可能解决学生的宿舍问题。学生们看到领导上认真对待大家的意见，都很感动。原来在大鸣大放期间受到右派分子迷惑的学生，也纷纷同右派分子划清界线。
    在工作制度方面也有了改进。不少单位健全了会议制度，取消了一些不必要开的会议。省人民法院和林业厅实行了党员负责干部每星期三、五下午接见群众的制度。监察厅听取群众意见后，厅长重新作了分工，密切联系所属干部，使领导和群众的关系近来有明显的改变，过去处理公民控诉案件积压拖拉的现象也正在积极改进。
