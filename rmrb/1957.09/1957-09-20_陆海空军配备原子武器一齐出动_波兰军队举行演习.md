Polish Army, Navy, and Air Force Equipped with Atomic Weapons Mobilize Together
Polish Army Holds Exercises

    Warsaw, September 19 (By Our Correspondent) – A large-scale military exercise of the Polish People's Army concluded on September 15 in the western region of Poland. The results of this exercise demonstrate that the increasingly strong Polish army is not only fully capable of defending the security of its socialist motherland, but also of fulfilling the tasks arising from Poland's membership in the Warsaw Treaty.
    Warsaw newspapers reported that various branches of the Polish People's Army participated in the exercise – the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Security Forces. The army used various new types of military equipment in the exercise, including atomic weapons. In the exercise, special attention was paid to the problem of high-speed coordinated action between various services, and to the problem of jet aircraft supporting ground forces. The results prove that this exercise has brought significant gains to the training and experience of the troops.
    Polish Minister of National Defense Spychalski pointed out at the end of the exercise: Next year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Army, and he called on all soldiers to commemorate this glorious year with new achievements in military training, and by improving the combat readiness of our army to defend the motherland and the socialist achievements of the Polish people. In addition to the leaders of the Polish state and army, representatives of the Warsaw Treaty Armed Forces Command, and military representatives from friendly countries, watched the exercise.
