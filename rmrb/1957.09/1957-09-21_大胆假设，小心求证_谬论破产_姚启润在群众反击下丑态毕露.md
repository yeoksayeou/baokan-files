    The Bankrupting of the Fallacy of "Bold Hypotheses, Careful Verification": Yao Qirun's Ugly Performance Exposed Under Mass Counterattack

    (Our dispatch) Rightist element Yao Qirun (technician) of the Meteorological Science Research Institute of the Central Meteorological Bureau, launched a frenzied attack on the Party during the blooming and contending period. He attempted to provoke the relationship between the Party and senior intellectuals, saying that the Party did not even have basic respect for senior intellectuals. Yao Qirun was investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as using the viewpoint of mechanical materialism to examine him, and using the idealism of "bold hypotheses, careful verification" to persecute good people. He even said in a threatening tone: "The one who tied the bell must untie it, and my problem must also be laid out and discussed."

    The masses refuted Yao Qirun's fabricated anti-communist slanders one by one. Lu Wu, Deputy Director of the Meteorological Bureau, said: "I can be considered an intellectual, right? The Party not only respects me, but also trusts me very much and gives me great power. Isn't Director Tu Changwang also a director without joining the Party? The claim that the Party does not respect intellectuals is simply too absurd." Technician Zhao Junzai said: The organization took a very cautious attitude towards Yao Qirun's historical problems, collected a lot of corroborating materials, and conducted a lot of investigation and research, which has nothing in common with "bold hypotheses, careful verification." It is precisely Yao Qirun himself who "boldly hypothesized" that the organization did not have a grasp of his materials, and therefore attacked the Party during the rectification campaign, using the posture of "careful verification" to test whether the organization was aware of his problems.

    According to disclosures, Yao Qirun served as a district captain of the Three People's Principles Youth League before liberation. While attending junior high school, he also organized an anti-communist small organization called "Three People's Principles Practicing Group"; during high school, he informed the Kuomintang Secret Service and Military Secret Service, sabotaged the progressive organization "Democratic Party," obstructed the progressive student movement, and launched anti-Soviet parades. After liberation, he also conspired with Military Secret Service agent Yan Zhongyi (already suppressed) to organize the "Anti-Communist Underground Army" in an attempt to coordinate with Chiang Kai-shek's counterattack against the mainland. Yao Qirun concealed most of these reactionary activities after he started working, and only made a preliminary confession during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

    “大胆假设，小心求证”谬论破产
    姚启润在群众反击下丑态毕露
    本报讯　中央气象局气象科学研究所的右派分子姚启润（技术员），在鸣放期间向党进行了猖狂的进攻。他企图挑拨党与高级知识分子的关系，说党对高级知识分子连起码的尊敬也没有。姚启润在肃反中曾被审查，他诬蔑肃反运动是用机械唯物论的观点审查他，是以
  “大胆假设，小心求证”的唯心主义来整好人。他更以要挟的口吻说：“解铃还得系铃人，也得把我的问题摊开来谈一谈。”
    群众对姚启润捏造的反共谰言，都一一予以驳斥。气象局副局长卢鋈说：“我可算个知识分子吧，党不仅尊敬我，而且非常信任我，给我很大的权力。涂长望局长不也是没入党就当了局长吗？党不尊敬知识分子的说法真是太荒谬了。”技术员赵君哉说：对于姚启润的历史问题，组织上采取了非常慎重的态度，收集了很多旁证材料，进行了很多调查研究工作，与
  “大胆假设，小心求证”毫无共同之处。恰恰是姚启润自己在“大胆假设”组织上没有掌握他的材料，因而在整风中向党进攻，以“小心求证”的姿态，来试探组织上是否对他的问题心中有数。
    据揭露，姚启润于解放前曾担任过三青团区队长。在初中上学期间，他又组织反共小组织“三民主义厉行团”；高中时代他曾向中统和军统特务告密，破坏进步社团“民主党”，阻挠进步学生运动并发动反苏游行。解放以后，他还和军统特务严重谊（已镇压）合谋组织“反共地下军”，企图策应蒋介石反攻大陆。这些反动活动，姚启润参加工作后，大部隐瞒了起来，直到肃反运动时才被迫作了初步交代。
