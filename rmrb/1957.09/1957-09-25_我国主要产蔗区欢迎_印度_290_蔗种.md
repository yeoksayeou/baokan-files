Major Sugarcane Producing Areas in China
Welcome the "India 290" Sugarcane Variety

    (Our dispatch) India is a world-renowned sugarcane producing area. Indian sugarcane varieties are widely welcomed in the major sugarcane producing areas of our country, especially in high-latitude and dry land sugarcane areas. The valuable agronomic characteristics of the "India 290" variety (cultivated by the Coimbatore Experiment Station in India), such as drought resistance, abundant tillering, fertilizer tolerance, non-hollow stalks, and cold resistance, are well known to sugarcane farmers in Sichuan, Zhejiang, northern Guangxi, and other places in our country. In recent years, the promotion of improved sugarcane varieties has been rapid. In Sichuan Province, the area planted with improved varieties increased from only two thousand mu in 1950 to more than two hundred thousand mu in 1956. The vast majority of these were "India 290." According to surveys, the sugarcane stalk yield per unit area of "India 290" is usually 25%-30% higher than that of the local "Lu sugarcane." In 1956, the Shuangjing Agricultural Cooperative in Neijiang, Sichuan, which achieved a yield of 11,829 jin per mu on a large area of 427 mu of sugarcane land, cultivated this variety. Another important reason why "India 290" is welcomed is, as Fang Pufu, a model agricultural worker in Zizhong, Sichuan, said: "This variety can be cultivated in both dams and mountains, the yield is stable, and the ratooning ability is strong, which can reduce production costs." In some areas, cultivating "India 290" can generally increase income by fifteen yuan per mu compared to local sugarcane varieties.
    Since 1953, our country has successively introduced thirty or forty new varieties from India. According to recent test records, the high yield of "India 312" is extremely good in the drylands of western Guangdong. In central Guangdong, "India 419" is a promising late-maturing, high-yielding variety.

    我国主要产蔗区
    欢迎“印度290”蔗种
    本报讯　印度是世界上著名的甘蔗产区。印度甘蔗品种在我国主要蔗区，特别是高纬度和旱地蔗区受到普遍的欢迎。“印度290”（印度哥因贝脱试验场育出）品种的抗旱、分蘖多、耐肥、不空心、抗寒等可贵的农艺特性，素为我国四川、浙江、桂北等地的蔗农所熟知。几年来，甘蔗良种工作推广迅速，四川省1950年只有良种二千亩，1956年就扩大到二十多万亩。其中绝大多数是“印度290”。据调查，“印度290”单位面积蔗茎产量通常高出当地“芦蔗”25％—30％。1956年在四百二十七亩大面积蔗地上，创造亩产一万一千八百二十九斤的四川内江双井农业社，就是栽培这个品种的。“印度290”受到欢迎的另一个重要原因，正如四川资中农业劳动模范方谱富所说：“这个品种，坝地、山地都可栽培，产量稳定，宿根力强，能够降低生产成本”。在一些地区，栽培“印度290”比土种甘蔗一般每亩能增加收益十五元。
    1953年以后，我国从印度陆续引进了三、四十个新品种。据最近试验记录，“印度312”的丰产性在粤西旱地表现极好；在粤中，“印度419是”一个有希望的晚熟高产品种。
