　　Guo Kang Carves "Million-Strong Army Crosses the Yangtze River"
    Guo Kang, an artist at the Guangzhou No. 1 Ivory Carving Production Cooperative, is carving "Million-Strong Army Crosses the Yangtze River" on a four-foot-long, sixty-plus-pound piece of ivory. This artwork depicts the heroic People's Liberation Army victoriously crossing the Yangtze River. It features more than 140 figures, along with boats, shore fortifications, and waves on the river, all in three dimensions. Large-scale ivory carvings like this have not been seen in nearly thirty years.
    The design of this artwork began in February of this year, and since carving began, many figures have been carved, and the initial shape of the boats has also been carved. It is expected to be completed in June of next year. Foreign guests from Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Tunisia, and other countries who have visited the cooperative recently have all praised its grand scale. In July of this year, when the Shanghai Scientific Film Studio came to the cooperative to shoot a film, this artwork was captured on film.
    Prior to this, Guo Kang had carved an ivory carving of "Crossing the Jinsha River," which was purchased by Governor Tao Zhu in April of this year and presented to Chairman Voroshilov, who was visiting Guangzhou at the time.

　　郭康雕刻“百万雄师渡长江”
    广州市第一象牙雕刻生产合作社的艺人郭康，正在一枝四尺长、六十多斤重的象牙上雕刻“百万雄师渡长江”。这件艺术品刻划英勇的解放军胜利渡长江的情景，人物有一百四十多个，还有船只、岸上堡垒、江上波涛，都是立体型的。近三十年来，像这样大型的象牙雕刻，还没有见过。
    这件艺术品从今年2月开始设计，雕刻以来，已经刻出许多人物，还刻出了船只的初型，预计明年6月可全部完成。最近期间到该社参观的越南、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、突尼斯等国外宾，都很赞赏它的规模的伟大。今年7月间，上海科学电影制片厂到该社拍电影时，已把这件艺术品摄入镜头。
    在这以前，郭康曾雕刻了一件“渡金沙江”的象牙雕刻，在今年4月间由陶铸省长买去送给当时正在广州访问的伏罗希洛夫主席。
