Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 9th: New fundamental measures for the management of Czechoslovakia's national economy are being drafted, and this autumn, the Czechoslovak Communist Party will submit them to all working people for nationwide discussion.

According to the "Red Right Daily," this news was announced by Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, on September 7th at the miners' conference held in Ostrava to celebrate Czechoslovak Miners' Day. He said that we are formulating new organizational forms of industrial management based on our specific conditions and the experience we have gained in economic management. We want to eliminate the contradiction between the current level of development of the national economy and the quality of its management. The fundamental purpose of the new organizational form is to strengthen the socialist management methods of enterprises while fully applying economic incentives in industrial management. Novotny said that it is necessary to ensure that the leading bodies actively influence production, and it is necessary to ensure that top-down leadership is more flexible and improves quality, as well as strengthening the participation and supervision of the working people in industrial management.

Novotny said that this new organizational form must achieve a substantial reduction in the size of administrative bodies.

Novotny emphasized that the continuous growth of Czechoslovakia's economic strength and the continuous improvement of the people's living conditions confirm the correctness of the Party's policy, but some shortcomings, especially the slow speed of reducing material consumption, the delayed adoption of new technologies, rigid management methods, chaotic wages, and poor labor discipline, have adversely affected the further development of the economy.

Novotny said that it is necessary to accelerate the speed of industrial production, which mainly depends on the further development of the fuel and metallurgical base. In all departments, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on construction projects that play a decisive role in ensuring the proportionate development of the national economy.

　　保证领导提高质量　加强劳动人民监督
　　捷正拟定国民经济管理新措施
    据新华社布拉格9日电　捷克斯洛伐克国民经济管理的新的基本措施正在拟定中，今年秋天将由捷克斯洛伐克共产党提交全体劳动人民进行全国性的讨论。
    据“红色权利报”报道，这个消息是由捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼9月7日在俄斯特拉发为庆祝捷克斯洛伐克矿工节而举行的矿工大会上发表的。他说，我们从我们的具体条件和在经济管理方面所取得的经验出发，来制定工业管理的新的组织形式。我们要消除国民经济现有发展水平同它的管理质量之间的矛盾。新的组织形式的根本目的是：在充分应用工业管理方面的经济刺激的情况下，加强企业的社会主义管理方法。诺沃提尼说，必须保证领导机构积极地影响生产，并且必须保证自上而下的领导比较灵活和提高质量，以及加强劳动人民参加工业的管理和监督。
    诺沃提尼强调说，这个新的组织形式必须做到大量缩减行政机构的编制。
    诺沃提尼着重指出，捷克斯洛伐克经济力量的不断增长和人民生活条件的不断改善证实了党的政策的正确性，但是有些缺点，特别是降低物资耗损的速度慢、新技术迟迟没有采用、管理方法呆板、工资混乱和劳动纪律差，这些缺点对经济的进一步发展起了不利的影响。
    诺沃提尼说，必须加快发展工业生产的速度，这主要取决于进一步发展燃料和冶金的基础。在各个部门中，必须集中力量进行对保证国民经济按比例发展起决定作用的那类建设事业。
