    Ushering in a New Upsurge in Agricultural Production
    Qinghai Provincial Party Committee Requires Leading Organs at All Levels to Recognize the New Situation After the Great Debate
    Fully Utilize the Enthusiasm of the Masses to Vigorously Build Farmland Water Conservancy in the Autumn and Winter Seasons
    (Reported by this newspaper) To lead the Great Debate well and usher in a new upsurge in rural production – this is the call issued by the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee at a joint telephone conference held on the evening of September 9. The conference made arrangements and deployments for the current agricultural production and the rural Great Debate, among other tasks.
    Zhang Guosheng, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the telephone conference: There are two major events in the countryside at present, one is agricultural production and the other is the Great Debate. These two events are closely related and must be done conscientiously. Whether the Great Debate is carried out well is a key issue related to whether the socialist position in the countryside can be consolidated. It is required that party and government leaders at all levels pay great attention, and carry out this movement in a planned and step-by-step manner. He said: Agricultural production is a regular task in the countryside, and agricultural production is continuous. Measures adapted to each period should be taken, one step followed by another, one link connected to another, adapting to the time and local conditions, and working actively and diligently. Only in this way can production be continuously improved and income increased. Some places relax production work after the autumn harvest, and this situation needs to be changed quickly. Comrade Zhang Guosheng pointed out: With the deepening of the Great Debate, the socialist awareness of the peasant masses is constantly improving, and a new upsurge in production will appear in the countryside. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize this new situation and adapt to it. It is necessary to closely integrate the socialist Great Debate with agricultural production. It is necessary to oppose the right-leaning ideology that ignores this situation. In political and ideological work, it is necessary to oppose right-leaning ideology, and the same is true in production. At the meeting, Secretary Zhang also gave instructions on farmland water conservancy construction and autumn plowing. He especially pointed out that water conservancy construction must rely on the people's strength, implement the spirit of building the country diligently and frugally, running cooperatives diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally, and fully utilize the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the masses to do it. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen propaganda and education to change the old ideas and old habits of some cadres and the masses who do not pay attention to water conservancy construction in autumn and think that water conservancy cannot be done in winter. In order to strengthen water conservancy work, each county should establish water conservancy organizations, and the staffing should be adjusted by the counties themselves. Townships should also establish water conservancy organizations, and agricultural cooperatives should also have special personnel responsible for leading this work.
    Sun Junyi, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor of the Provincial People's Committee, said at the telephone conference that whether the farmland water conservancy work in autumn and winter this year is carried out well is an important issue related to whether agricultural production can increase next year. It is hoped that all parts of the province will earnestly implement the spirit of "repair when there is drought, repair even when there is no drought, repair every year, and repair regularly" as instructed by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, and actively do this work well. The province plans to expand the irrigated area by 240,000 mu in 1958. In addition to the 90,000 mu of irrigated area planned for irrigation canals operated by the state, it is required that the farmland water conservancy projects built by the masses themselves expand the irrigated area by 150,000 mu. In addition, Comrade Sun Junyi also requested in his report that all localities do a good job in autumn plowing, afforestation and seedling cultivation, fertilizer accumulation, winter irrigation, livestock feeding and management, and soil and water conservation.

    迎接农业生产的新高潮
    青海省委要求各级领导机关认清大辩论后的新情况
    充分运用群众积极性在秋冬两季大力兴修农田水利
    本报讯领导好大辩论，迎接农村生产新高潮，——这是中共青海省委会和省人民委员会在9月9日晚联合召开的电话会议上发出的号召。这次会议就当前农业生产和农村大辩论等项工作作了安排和布置。
    中共青海省委书记张国声同志在电话会议上说：当前在农村有两件大事，一是农业生产，一是大辩论。这两件事都是密切关联的，都要认真做好。大辩论搞好与否，是关系农村社会主义阵地能否巩固的关键问题。要求各级党、政领导十分重视，有计划、有步骤的把这次运动搞好。他说：农业生产是农村经常的任务，农业生产是有连续性的，每一个时期都应采取适应这个时期的措施，一步跟上一步，一环连上一环，因时因地制宜，积极努力地进行。只有这样，才能不断提高生产，增加收入。有些地方在秋收以后放松生产工作，这种情况需要很快改变。张国声同志指出：随着大辩论的深入开展，农民群众的社会主义觉悟不断提高，农村将要出现新的生产高潮，所以必须认识这个新的情况，适应新的情况。要使社会主义大辩论和农业生产紧密的结合起来。要反对漠视这种情况的右倾思想。在政治思想工作上反对右倾思想，在生产上也同样要反对右倾思想。会上，张书记还就兴修农田水利和翻秋槎等项工作作了指示。他特别指出，兴修水利一定要依靠民力，贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的精神，充分利用群众中的人力、物力、财力来办。此外，还要加强宣传教育，改变有些干部和群众秋季不重视兴修水利和以为冬天不能搞水利的旧认识旧习惯。为了加强水利工作，各县应成立水利机构，编制由各县自己调整，乡也应成立水利机构，农业社也应有专人负责领导此项工作。
    省委常务委员、省人民委员会副省长孙君一同志在电话会议上说，今年秋、冬农田水利工作开展得好坏，是关系到明年农业能否增产的重要问题，希望全省各地切实贯彻执行省委和省人民委员会指示的“天旱要修，天不旱也要修，年年修，经常修”的精神，积极作好这一工作。全省1958年计划扩大灌溉面积二十四万亩，除国家经营的灌溉渠道计划灌溉面积九万亩外，要求群众自己兴修的农田水利工程扩大灌溉面积十五万亩。此外，孙君一同志在报告中还要求各地做好翻秋槎、造林育苗，积肥、冬季灌溉、牲畜饲养管理、水土保持等项工作。
