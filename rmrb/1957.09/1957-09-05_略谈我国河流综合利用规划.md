A Brief Discussion on the Comprehensive Utilization Planning of Rivers in China
Zhang Changling, Wang Yifu, Lu QinKan

To comprehensively utilize a river, planning must be done in advance. And to plan correctly, all related issues must be examined and analyzed comprehensively: we must consider both tributaries and main streams; we must consider flood control, drainage and irrigation, as well as power generation, navigation, and urban and industrial water use; we must consider reservoirs, as well as dikes and lowland storage; we must consider hydroelectric power stations, as well as thermal power stations; we must consider gravity-flow irrigation canals, as well as pumped irrigation and well and pond construction; we must consider the benefits of river development, as well as the cost of national investment and reservoir inundation; we must consider the immediate requirements, as well as the long-term development prospects. In this way, we can meet both the immediate needs of all parties concerned and the long-term development needs of the national economy; we can build hydraulic structures with the least investment, eliminate water and drought disasters, and utilize natural resources to maximize the benefits to the national economy.

In the past eight years, we have built a number of water conservancy projects and hydropower stations on many rivers, which have played a certain role in flood control, power generation, irrigation, navigation, and water supply. However, due to the limitations of objective and subjective conditions at the time, some projects were designed and constructed without comprehensive consideration of the entire basin, and some projects started from a certain aspect without considering the requirements of other national economic sectors. For example, the Guanting, Dahuoofang, Foziling, and Meishan reservoir projects were all transformed into comprehensive water conservancy hubs for flood control, power generation, irrigation, and urban and industrial water use after repeated research by relevant departments during the construction process. The completed flood control reservoirs in the Huai River, such as Shimantan, Banqiao, Baisha, and Boshan, are also planned to be heightened, expanded in capacity, and to take irrigation requirements into account. These changes are necessary. However, changing the design in the middle of construction, or reconstructing after completion, will cause more or less loss to the country. This lesson has educated water conservancy and hydropower workers, making us pay attention to the comprehensive utilization planning of rivers.

In 1954, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the Ministry of Communications and other relevant departments cooperated, with the help of Soviet expert groups, to conduct a comprehensive utilization plan for the Yellow River, taking into account the requirements of flood control, power generation, irrigation, navigation and other aspects, and proposed a comprehensive plan for governing and developing the Yellow River.

This work created a model for governing and developing major rivers across the country. After 1954, planning for major rivers such as the Yangtze River, Huai River, Hai River, Pearl River, Heilongjiang River, and Liao River began successively. Now, the comprehensive utilization planning reports for the Huai River and the Hai River have been preliminarily completed, and opinions from all parties are being solicited. The planners of these two reports have studied in detail the natural and economic characteristics of the basins and have carried out arduous and complex work. However, this plan is not without its debatable points. The main questions are: Is the flood control standard too high, and not combined with drainage? Is too much attention paid to large-scale water conservancy hubs, while neglecting mass water conservancy measures? Is the national economic situation ignored, and the demands for too much and too fast investment made from the perspective of one region? For example, the comprehensive utilization plan for the Huai River basin, starting from the fundamental treatment of the Huai River and the thorough solution of water and drought disasters, suggests the construction of four reservoirs, Foziling, Xianghongdian, Mozitan, and Lianghekou, on the tributary Two Rivers. Upon investigation, the drainage area of the Pi River above Lianghekou is only 4,280 square kilometers, and the average annual runoff of Lianghekou is only 3.1 billion cubic meters, while the total storage capacity of the four reservoirs is 7.5 billion cubic meters, requiring an investment of 360 million yuan. Whether this plan is economically reasonable is doubtful. The plan also suggests the construction of the Linhuai Gang major control project on the main stream of the Huai River. According to the report, the dam is 100 kilometers long, relocates 500,000 people, inundates 1.56 million mu of cultivated land, and requires an investment of more than 400 million yuan. The purpose of building this huge project is to control the once-in-three-hundred-year flood that may occur in the middle reaches of the Huai River. However, the drainage measures for farmland in the plains area planned in the plan only guarantee that they will not be affected by disasters during heavy rains that occur once every ten to twenty years. In fact, when a once-in-three-hundred-year flood occurs, most areas will definitely be flooded, and at this time, only flood control is possible, not drainage. The actual significance of the project is worth further study.

The Hai River basin planning report also has similar situations. In order to eliminate flood disasters that occur once every few decades or centuries, this report suggests building large reservoirs on almost every tributary. Eleven are to be built in the near future alone, with an investment of more than 2.2 billion yuan.

We believe that the flood control standard should be appropriately lowered, the number of large reservoirs should be reduced, and mass, comprehensive water conservancy construction should be vigorously carried out. For example, small reservoirs can be built in mountainous areas, terraced fields can be repaired, forests can be cultivated, and plains can open up ditches, ponds, and low-lying fields, repair ditches and canals, use pits and ponds to store water, and promote crop rotation. This way, the investment is less and the benefits are faster. However, some people have the idea of ​​relying solely on national investment to carry out projects and ignore these mass works. When considering investment, they did not start from the actual conditions of the country. The Huai River report suggests that the state invests 5.4 billion yuan in the near future, and the Hai River report suggests that the state invests 7.2 billion yuan in the near future, with mass investment excluded. Such a large amount of farmland water conservancy construction funds in one region does not seem to be in line with China's recent economic situation. Such a planning report has little practical significance.

The Yangtze River is China's first major river, and its governance and development have a huge impact on all national economic sectors. Since the drafting of the outline of the Yangtze River Basin plan began last year, there have been many debates. The opinion of the comrades in charge of this plan is to build a large reservoir in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to solve the millennium flood of the Yangtze River in one fell swoop; they also advocate the centralized construction of a large number of industrial enterprises with high power consumption to consume more than 100 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year; and require ten-thousand-ton ships to reach Chongqing directly. Another opinion is that the governance and development of the Yangtze River must be adapted to the development of the national economy, developing tributaries first, then the main stream; doing small projects first, then large projects; fully utilizing existing dikes and lakes and low-lying areas first, then large reservoirs on the main and tributary streams for comprehensive utilization; gradually increasing power generation capacity; and gradually improving flood control standards. We believe that this debate is very good, and correct conclusions can be drawn from the debate.

From some of the issues mentioned above, it can be seen that the comprehensive utilization planning of rivers is a very complex and arduous task, involving many departments. However, up to now, there is still no national design code. We hope that under the leadership of the State Construction Commission, all relevant parties will jointly prepare a relatively unified river planning code, and make principled regulations on common and major issues in the planning work. For example, determining the principles of flood control standards for various regions, various conditions, and different periods, calculating the methods of benefit and investment sharing of comprehensive utilization projects, calculating the economic value of inundating farmland and towns, and so on. The code can also be accompanied by the separate requirements (or supplementary regulations) of the relevant departments, which will be uniformly promulgated by the state and become a code universally used by all departments.

Regarding the organizational work of compiling comprehensive river utilization plans, the state has not yet made a clear regulation, which has caused some duplication and disconnection in the work between various departments. For the planning of large rivers, there is already the example of the Yellow River. A planning committee should be organized under the unified leadership of the state, and relevant departments and local agencies should jointly prepare it. For medium-sized rivers, depending on the specific circumstances, a department can be the main body and combine with local agencies to be responsible for planning. However, attention must be paid to soliciting the opinions of all relevant departments at any time, and reaching the goal of true comprehensive utilization under common agreement.

The comprehensive utilization of rivers has now been accepted by everyone in principle, but because this issue involves several national economic sectors and the relationship is very complicated, various different views are often encountered on some principled and specific issues. Now we put this issue forward for discussion, and the purpose is to facilitate the making of more complete river comprehensive utilization plans in the future.

    略谈我国河流综合利用规划
    张昌龄、王伊复、陆钦侃
    要综合利用一条河流，必须事先进行规划。而要规划得正确，一定要全面地考察和分析一切有关的问题：既要看到支流，也要看到干流；既要看到防洪、排涝和灌溉，也要看到发电、航运以及城市和工业用水；既要看到水库，也要看到堤防和洼地蓄洪；既要看到水电站，也要看到火电站；既要看到自流渠灌溉，也要看到扬水灌溉和掘井筑塘；既要看到河流开发的效益，也要看到国家投资和水库淹没的代价；既要看到近期的要求，也要看到远景的发展。这样，才能做到既能满足各有关方面近期的要求，又能满足国民经济远景发展的要求；才能做到以最少的投资修建水工建筑物，消除水旱灾害和利用天然资源，使国民经济获得最大的效益。
    八年来，我们在许多河流上建造了不少水利工程和水电站，在防洪、发电、灌溉、航运、给水等方面都发挥了一定的作用。但是由于当时主客观条件的限制，有些工程没有经过全流域的通盘考虑便设计施工，有些工程单从某一方面出发，没有考虑其他国民经济部门的要求。例如，官厅、大伙房、佛子岭、梅山诸水库工程，都是在开工以后，经过有关部门反复研究，边施工边修改，才成为防洪、发电、灌溉和城市及工业用水综合利用的水利枢纽。已完成的淮河石漫滩、板桥、白沙、薄山等防洪水库，也都准备加高坝身，扩大库容，兼顾灌溉的要求。这些更改都是必要的。但是，在施工中途更改设计，或在完工以后再行改建，都要或多或少地给国家造成损失。这种经验教训教育了水利、水电工作人员，使我们重视了河流的综合利用规划工作。
    1954年，水利部、电力工业部、交通部及其他有关部门共同合作，在苏联专家组的帮助下，对黄河进行了综合利用规划，考虑到防洪、发电、灌溉、航运等各方面的要求，提出了治理与开发黄河的全面方案。
    这件工作为治理与开发全国各大河流创造了范例。1954年以后，对长江、淮河、海河、珠江、黑龙江、辽河等大河流都相继开始规划，现在淮河和海河的综合利用规划报告已初步完成，正在征求各方面的意见。两本报告的规划人员都详尽地研究了流域的自然特征和经济特征，进行了艰巨而复杂的工作。但是，这个规划仍然不无可以商榷之处。主要是：是否防洪标准过高，没有和排涝相结合？是否过分注意大型水利枢纽，忽视了群众性的水利措施？是否忽视了国家的经济情况，而从一个地区着眼，要求过多、过快的投资？例如淮河流域的综合利用规划，从根治淮河，彻底解决水、旱灾害出发，在支流两河上建议建造佛子岭、响洪甸、磨子潭和两河口四个水库。查两河口以上的渒河流域面积仅四千二百八十平方公里，两河口多年平均径流计三十一亿公方，而四个水库的总库容共达七十五亿公方，要投资三亿六千万元。这个方案是否经济合理，值得怀疑。这个方案还建议在淮河干流上建造临淮岗大控制。据报告估计，堤坝长一百公里，迁移人口五十万，淹没耕地一百五十六万亩，投资四亿多元。修建这个巨大工程的目的，是用来控制淮河中游或许发生的三百年一遇的洪水。但是方案中规划的平原区农田的排涝措施，仅保证在十到二十年一遇的暴雨时不受灾害。实际上，当发生三百年一遇的洪水时，大部分地区一定会渍涝成灾，这时，只能防洪而不能排涝，工程的实际意义有多大，也值得进一步研究。
    海河流域规划报告也有类似的情况。为了消除几十年或百年一遇的洪水灾害，这个报告几乎在每条支流上都建议建造大型水库，只是近期就要兴建十一座，投资二十余亿元。
    我们认为，应当适当降低防洪标准、减少大型水库，而大力开展群众性、综合性的水利建设。例如山区可以多修小水库，整修梯田，培育林木，平原则开拓沟泊洼田，整修沟渠，利用坑塘蓄水，推行作物改种等。这样做，投资既少，效益又快。但是有些人存在单纯依靠国家投资举办工程的思想，忽视了这些群众性的工作。他们在考虑投资时，没有从国家的实际条件出发。像淮河报告建议国家近期投资五十四亿元，海河报告建议近期投资七十二亿元，群众性投资在外。一个地区的农田水利建设费如此之巨，似乎与我国近期的经济情况不相适应。这样的规划报告，现实意义是不大的。
    长江是我国的第一条大河，它的治理与开发对各个国民经济部门都有非常巨大的影响。自从去年开始编制长江流域规划要点以来，曾有过很多的论争。主持这个规划的负责同志的意见，只是想在长江干流的三峡修建一个大水库，以便一举而解决长江的千年洪水；还主张集中建设大量耗电多的工业企业来消纳每年一千多亿度的电力；并要求万吨大轮船直通重庆。另一种意见认为长江的治理与开发必须与国民经济的发展相适应，先开发支流，后开发干流；先做小工程，后做大工程；先充分利用现有堤防及湖泊洼地，后做综合利用的干支流大水库；发电能力逐步增加；防洪标准逐步提高。我们认为，这种论争是很好的，可以从论争中获得正确的结论。
    从前面所谈到的一些问题可以看出，河流综合利用规划是一件非常复杂艰巨的工作，涉及的部门很多。但是，到现在为止，还没有一本全国性的设计规程。我们希望在国家建设委员会的领导下，由各有关方面共同编制一个比较统一的河流规划规程，对于规划工作中普遍而重大的问题作出原则性的规定。例如确定各地区、各种条件和不同时期的防洪标准的原则，综合利用工程效益和投资分摊的计算方法，淹没农田城镇的经济价值的计算原则，等等。规程中还可附上各有关部门的分别要求（或补充规程），由国家统一颁布，成为各部通用的规程。
    关于编制河流综合利用规划的组织工作，到现在国家也还没有一个明确的规定，因而引起了各部门间工作上的某些重复和脱节。对于大河流的规划工作，已有黄河的范例，应在国家统一领导下组织规划委员会，有关各部门和地方机构会同起来编制。中型河流，根据具体情况，可由一个部门为主，结合地方机关负责进行规划。但必须随时注意征求各有关部门的意见，在共同协议之下，达到真正的综合利用的目的。
    河流的综合利用在原则上现在已为大家所接受，但由于这个问题牵涉到几个国民经济部门，关系很复杂，往往遇到一些原则问题和具体问题，还有各种不同的看法。现在我们把这个问题提出来供大家讨论，目的是为了便于今后做出更为完善的河流综合利用规划。
