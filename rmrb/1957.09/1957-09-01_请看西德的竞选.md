    Let's Look at the West German Election
    The West German election is only half a month away. The candidates of the ruling party in West Germany are traveling everywhere, busy giving campaign speeches to voters.
    Federal parliament member Harnischfeger is the Christian Democratic Union candidate for the Gladbeck constituency. He is full of confidence in his ability to turn black into white. One day, he came to a factory in this constituency and gave a speech to the workers, truly eloquent, embellishing the "benefits" of West Germany's atomic armament, participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and West Germany's economic development.
    Unfortunately, however, Mr. Harnischfeger's eloquent oratory did not win the appreciation of the audience. As soon as his speech stopped, countless questions and doubts, like machine-gun fire, came from all directions.
    A miner stood up and asked: "When a family with many children cannot afford fruit due to rising prices, can you still call this policy for the benefit of the whole society?"
    A worker also asked: "Why does the Christian Democratic Union support the atomic bill? Does it want to lead us unrestricted down the road of atomic armament?"
    A Christian worker also questioned: "I really don't understand why the Christian Democratic Union ignores the sincere conscience of Christianity and passes the conscription bill."
    Then a trade union member shouted: "Prevent Harnischfeger and the Christian Democratic Union, rise up and defend yourselves!"
    Angry accusations continued to assail Mr. Harnischfeger. The candidate's face turned pale. Finally, amidst the uproar, Harnischfeger shouted, "I have absolutely no reason or obligation to answer you," and slipped away.
    Mr. Harnischfeger thus had an unpleasant experience. But he was lucky compared to the situation encountered by the other two candidates, the current West German Minister of Transport Seebohm and Minister of Defense Strauss.
    Seebohm recently delivered very blatant militaristic fallacies at a campaign rally in Hamburg. Before he had finished his speech, the audience kept shouting loudly: "Seebohm, get out!" "Seebohm is lying!" For a time, the meeting was in complete chaos, and even the "pickets" composed of fascists could not control it. Seebohm had to step down and scurry away with his head in his hands.
    Strauss gave a campaign speech in Rheinhausen on August 29, and the masses issued angry roars and contemptuous boos at him. Finally, the Minister of Defense had to interrupt his speech and slip off the podium.
    The embarrassment of these three candidates is a perfect satire of the Adenauer party's self-aggrandizement.

### 请看西德的竞选

    请看西德的竞选
    现在离西德大选日子只有半个月了。西德执政党的候选人正到处奔波，忙着向选民作竞选演讲。
    联邦议会议员哈尼希费格是基督教民主联盟葛拉特卑克选区的候选人。他对他自己的颠倒黑白的才能满怀信心。一天，他来到这个选区的一个工厂，向工人作演讲，真个是口若悬河，把西德进行原子武装，参加北大西洋集团以及西德经济发展的种种“好处”说得天花乱坠。
    但是遗憾得很，哈尼希费格先生的这种雄辩的口才却没有得到听众的赏识，他的演讲刚一停，就从四面八方像机关炮一样射来了无数的质问和疑难。
    一个矿工起来问道：“当一个多子女的家庭由于物价上涨而买不起水果时，你还能把这个政策称作是为了全社会的吗”？
    一个工人又问：“基督教民主联盟为什么要赞成原子法案？它是要使我们无限制地走向原子军备的道路吗”？
    一个基督教工人也质问：“我真不明白，基督教民主联盟为什么要忽视基督教的真诚的良知而通过征兵法案”。
    接着一个工会会员叫道：“预防哈尼希费格和基督教民主联盟，起来保卫你们自己吧！”
    愤怒的责问声不断地向这位哈尼希费格先生袭来。这位候选人的脸色变得煞白。最后，在喧嚷声中，哈尼希费格大叫一声：“对于你们，我完全没有理由和义务来回答”，就溜之大吉了。
    哈尼希费格先生就是这样讨了一场没趣。但是他比起另外两位候选人、现任西德政府运输部长塞博姆和国防部长施特劳斯所遭遇的情况来，那还算是幸运的。
    塞博姆最近在汉堡的一次竞选群众大会上，发表了十分露骨的军国主义谬论。他演说还没有完，台下的听众就不断地大声高呼：“塞博姆，滚出去！”“塞博姆在骗人！”一时会场上秩序大乱，由法西斯分子组成的“纠察队”也无法控制了。塞博姆不得不下台抱头鼠窜而去。
    施特劳斯8月29日在莱因豪森发表竞选演说，群众对他发出了愤怒的吼声和轻蔑的嘘声。最后这位国防部长不得不中断演说，溜下讲台。
    这三位候选人的狼狈相，对于阿登纳党的自我吹嘘，真是极妙讽刺。
