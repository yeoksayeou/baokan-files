On the Anti-Rightist Front

Guo Jingtian's Attack on the Party Was Extremely Rampant
    Guo Jingtian, the leader of the Encyclopedia Dictionary Editorial Group of the Shidai Publishing House and a rightist, used thirteen pseudonyms and wrote twenty-three big-character posters filled with slander, libel, and vilification of the Party during the "blooming and contending" period of just over twenty days. He described the Shidai Publishing House as "a complete mess," negated the achievements of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign and the Cadre Review Movement, and berated probationary Party members as "slaves" who became members by "flattering" superiors. He also slandered, saying, "The Party is too short of talent; it's either incompetent or useless," and so on. He insulted 80% of the Party members in the publishing house.
    Guo Jingtian used the most vile and treacherous methods to release poisonous arrows at the Party. He imitated other people's handwriting and speculated on their tone to write big-character posters, attempting to sow discord and frame others. After the articles were posted, he would pull people over to look at them, saying this one looks like so-and-so's handwriting, and that one sounds like so-and-so's tone. He also spread rumors, saying, "The Shidai Publishing House is too undemocratic; the masses don't even dare to offer opinions using their real names!" In addition, Guo Jingtian illegally convened two joint "special person symposiums" of various departments and offices, specifically to "rectify" the Party branch secretary and two Party members. Encouraged by the "victorious situation" he created, he even arrogantly called on the masses to "follow me" instead of following the Party.
    He and Feng Yidai, a rightist from the Foreign Languages ​​Press, repeatedly plotted in secret rooms to form a "united front." He also wrote articles in a frenzied manner, loudly calling on Party members to "rebel," specifically naming seven Party members to "step forward" and "courageously expose" what arrangements the Party organization had made "recently."
    Guo Jingtian's hideous face of anti-Party and anti-socialist has been completely exposed by the masses.

Li Geng was the mastermind
    The China Youth Publishing House has held extended Party group meetings for several days to expose and criticize the anti-Party words and deeds of Li Geng, the former deputy secretary of the Party group, deputy director, and editor-in-chief of the publishing house.
    A large number of revealed facts prove that Li Geng was the mastermind behind the rightists of the China Youth Publishing House. The shells fired by rightists Peng Zigang, Liu Zhong, Yao Ping, and others at the Party were almost entirely supplied by Li Geng. Li Geng also had close ties with Jiang Feng's anti-Party group, played the role of a "strategist," and covered up for Jiang Feng's anti-Party group.
    According to reports, Li Geng tried to bring down the China Youth Publishing House and actively planned to restore the "Kaiming Bookstore." He also actively campaigned to run a "literary journal" for young people that was free from Party leadership, attempting to compete with the "China Youth" magazine. Li Geng greatly admired Fei Xiaotong's article "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals," saying, "Party intellectuals have the same feelings." He also expressed his intention to write an article describing the feelings of Party intellectuals to echo each other. Li Geng also promoted Zhang Bojun's fallacy of praising Chu Anping, and praised the notorious Lin Xiling and Tan Tianrong as "historical figures," wanting to write "biographies" for them.

For Whom Did Chen Ren Gang Reverse Verdicts?
    This spring, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party criticized the serious right-leaning ideology that existed among certain cadres in the political and legal departments. Chen Ren Gang (Deputy Director of the Provincial Justice Department, Secretary of the Party Group of the Justice Department), after learning of this instruction from the Provincial Committee, on the one hand, blocked the news from the cadres of the Justice Department, and on the other hand, behind the back of the Provincial Committee, took his confidants Liu Jiajie (Deputy Director of the First Division of the Justice Department, member of the Party Group of the Justice Department) and others to "inspect" a batch of cases in the Ningguo, Jixi, and Shexian county courts. He then instructed the county courts to overturn judgments and release many criminals.
    The Provincial Higher People's Court randomly inspected seventy criminal cases from these three counties that Chen Ren Gang and others had "inspected" and believed had "problems," including twenty-nine counter-revolutionary cases and forty-one criminal cases involving rape, theft, fraud, sabotage of production, and disruption of unified purchase and sales. After case-by-case review, it was found that after Chen Ren Gang and others' "inspection," there were forty-nine cases that were wrongly revised or wrongly released, accounting for 70% of the total number of cases. Chen Ren Gang and Liu Jiajie held many absurd arguments while maliciously distorting these forty-nine cases that were originally correctly or basically correctly judged, and their attitude towards individual cases was even more intolerable.
    For example, Hu Tianmu, a Kuomintang member in Jixi County, had fabricated many rumors about foreign and domestic affairs since 1950, which caused very bad consequences, such as the rumors he spread about pig farming, which caused the masses to slaughter fat pigs indiscriminately; Hu Tianmu also viciously insulted the people's leaders. Chen Ren Gang went to great lengths to defend this counter-revolutionary element, saying, "Fabricating rumors belongs to the nature of learning, and the purpose of spreading rumors does not exist, so it cannot be regarded as fabricating rumors." Therefore, it "does not constitute a counter-revolutionary crime" and "can be re-sentenced to education and release."
    Since this spring, Chen Ren Gang has been clamoring everywhere, slandering that the Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's criticism of the right-leaning ideology of certain political and legal cadres has "reversed" the rule of law that has been built up over the years. However, the revealed facts show that it is Chen Ren Gang himself who is destroying the rule of law. (Xinhua News Agency)

What Kind of "Human Touch" is Mao Xiao Cen?
    Mao Xiao Cen is a member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association, a standing committee member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and deputy director of academic affairs of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial and Commercial Political School. According to reports, he tried his best to encourage the rightists among the students to attack the Communist Party in the political school. Huang Miaofu, a rightist in the school, distributed reactionary pamphlets several times during the blooming and contending period, which was supported by Mao Xiao Cen. Mao Xiao Cen also took Huang Miaofu's reactionary pamphlets to the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference to read them publicly, expanding their influence. During the period of blooming and contending. Mao Xiao Cen was extremely active. Anyone who was dissatisfied with the Communist Party or had complaints was asked to write them into "materials," which were distorted and exaggerated to be used as his bullets to attack the Communist Party. Mao Xiao Cen slandered Communist Party members as having "no human touch" and provoked by saying that the relationship between the Communist Party and the masses was like "a mother-in-law and son-in-law, seeming affectionate but ultimately outsiders."
    When the anti-rightist struggle began in the Industrial and Commercial Political School, Mao Xiao Cen avoided going to school. When the spearhead of the struggle pointed at Mao Xiao Cen himself, he immediately threatened the activists who exposed him, which aroused great indignation among people in industrial and commercial circles.

Ma Tingxiu Has Always Hated the Party's Policies
    Ma Tingxiu is the Deputy Secretary-General of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He has always hated the Party's various policies and used every opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. In 1951, he opposed the land reform movement, saying, "China only has the difference between great poverty and small poverty, and Gansu is even more so." In the second half of 1956, he and rightist Wang Zhiqi inspected work in Gannan and Linxia. After the inspection, he promoted everywhere that agricultural cooperativization was "terrible."
    Ma Tingxiu also launched vicious attacks on the Party's united front work and personnel work. He slandered the Party's personnel work as not "the virtuous in position and the capable in office."
    Ma Tingxiu also completely obliterated the achievements of the Party in the work of building the legal system in recent years. He reversed black and white, saying: "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, no complete legal system has been formulated, nor has the concept of a socialist legal system been established, nor has the spirit of abiding by the law been cultivated, nor has legal education been carried out. This is the cause of sectarianism, subjectivism, and bureaucratism."
    Ma Tingxiu's fallacies have been criticized and countered by the masses. (Xinhua News Agency)

专栏：在反右派战线上

    在反右派战线上
    郭景天向党进攻十分猖狂
    时代出版社百科辞典编辑组长、右派分子郭景天，在二十几天的“鸣放”期内，用了十三个化名，写了二十三篇造谣中伤、诬蔑谩骂、丑化党的大字报。他把时代出版社说成“一塌糊涂”，否定肃反和审干成绩、谩骂预备党员都是“奴才”，是靠“拍马屁”成为党员的。还污蔑说，“党太无人材，不是脓包就是饭桶”，等等。社内80％的党员都被他骂到了。
    郭景天的向党施放毒箭，是用了最下流、最奸险的手法的。他摹仿别人的笔迹，揣摩别人的口气写大字报，企图以此进行挑拨离间，嫁祸于人。文章贴出去之后，他拉一些人去看，说这篇像谁的笔迹，那篇又像谁的口气。还放空气说，“时代出版社太无民主，群众用真姓名提意见都不敢了！”此外，郭景天还非法地召开了两次各部室联席的“专人座谈会”，专门“整”党支部书记和两个党员。在自己制造的“胜利形势”的鼓舞下，他竟狂妄地向群众号召“跟我走”不要跟党走。
    他和外文出版社右派分子冯亦代一再策划于密室，组成“统一战线”。他还狂妄地写文章大声疾呼，叫党员“起义”，指名要七个党员“挺身而出”，“勇敢地暴露”党组织“最近一个时期作过什么布置”。
    郭景天的反党、反社会主义的狰狞面目已被群众完全揭露。
    李庚原是幕后指挥
    中国青年出版社连日召开党组扩大会议，揭发和批判该社前党组副书记、副社长兼总编辑李庚的反党言行。
    揭发出来的大量事实证明：李庚是中国青年出版社右派分子的幕后指挥人。右派分子彭子冈、刘重、姚平等向党进攻的炮弹，几乎绝大部分都是李庚输送给他们的。李庚和江丰反党集团也有着密切的联系，扮演了“策士”的角色，并为江丰反党集团打掩护。
    据揭发，李庚力图搞垮中国青年出版社、积极策划恢复“开明书店”。他还大肆活动，要办一个不要党领导的、面向青年的“同人刊物”，企图和“中国青年”杂志唱对台戏。李庚对费孝通的“知识分子的早春天气”一文大为赞赏，说：“党内知识分子也有同样心情”。还表示要写一篇描述党内知识分子这种心情的文章彼此呼应。李庚还推销章伯钧夸耀储安平的谬论，夸耀臭名远扬的林希翎和谭天荣为“历史人物”，要为他们写“列传”。　（新华社）
    陈仁刚为什么人翻案？
    今年春季，中共安徽省委批判政法部门某些干部中严重存在的右倾思想。陈仁刚（省司法厅副厅长、中共司法厅党组书记）在知道省委的这个指示后，一面对司法厅的干部封锁消息，一面背着省委，带着他的亲信刘家杰（司法厅一处副处长、中共司法厅党组成员）等在宁国、绩溪、歙县等三个县法院“检查”了一批案件后，指示县法院改判、释放了不少罪犯。
    省高级人民法院抽查了这三个县曾经陈仁刚等“检查”并认为有“问题”的七十件刑事案件，其中有反革命案二十九件，强奸、盗窃、诈骗、破坏生产、破坏统购统销等刑事犯罪案四十一件。经逐案审查，发现经过陈仁刚等的“检查”，仅指示县法院错改错放的即有四十九件，占总案数的70％。陈仁刚、刘家杰在恶意歪曲这四十九件原判正确或基本正确的案件时，所持的论点很多都是荒谬的，而他们对个别案件所持的态度，更是令人不能容忍。
    例如绩溪县国民党员胡天木1950年以来，先后就外交内政等方面制造了许多谣言，并引起很坏的后果，如他在养猪方面的造谣引起群众滥宰肥猪；胡天木还恶毒地辱骂人民领袖。陈仁刚竟挖空心思地为这个反革命分子辩护说：“制造谣言是属于学说的性质，传谣的目的不存在，不能视为造谣”。因此“构不成反革命犯罪”，“可改判教育释放”。
    今春以来，陈仁刚到处大肆叫嚣，诬蔑中共省委批判某些政法干部的右倾思想，是将几年来建设起来的法制都“反”掉了。但揭露出来的事实说明破坏法制的却正是陈仁刚自己。

    毛啸岑是什末“人情味”
    毛啸岑是民建上海市委委员、市工商联常务委员、上海市工商界政治学校副教务主任，据揭露，他在政治学校中竭力鼓励学员中的右派分子向共产党进攻。学校中的右派分子黄苗夫在大放大鸣时数次散发反动小册子，就是受毛啸岑支持的。毛啸岑还把黄苗夫的反动小册子带到市政协会议上去当众宣读，扩大影响。在大鸣大放期间。毛啸岑极为活跃，凡是对共产党不满、有牢骚的人，他都要他们写成“材料”，并加以歪曲渲染，作为他向共产党进攻的子弹。毛啸岑污蔑共产党员“没有人情味”，并挑拨说共产党与群众是“丈母娘与女婿，好像亲热，究属外人”。
    在工商界政治学校开始反右派斗争时，毛啸岑避不到校。当斗争的矛头指向毛啸岑本人时，他立即对揭露他的积极分子进行威胁，工商界人士对此极为愤慨。　（新华社）
    马廷秀一贯仇视党的政策
    马廷秀是政协甘肃省委员会副秘书长。他一贯仇视共产党的各项政策，并利用一切机会进行破坏活动。1951年他反对土地改革运动，说“中国只有大贫小贫之别，甘肃更是这样。”1956年下半年，他和右派分子王治岐视察甘南和临夏工作，视察后，他便到处宣传农业合作化“糟得很”。
    马廷秀还向党的统战工作和人事工作进行了恶毒的攻击。他诬蔑党的人事工作不是“贤者在位，能者在职”。
    马廷秀还一笔抹杀几年来党在法制建设工作上的成就，他颠倒黑白地说：“中华人民共和国成立到现在，没有制定出完备的法制，也未建立起社会主义法制的观念，没有养成遵守法制的精神，也未进行法制教育。这是产生宗派主义、主观主义、官僚主义的原因。”
    马廷秀的这些谬论，已经受到群众的批判和反击。　（新华社）
