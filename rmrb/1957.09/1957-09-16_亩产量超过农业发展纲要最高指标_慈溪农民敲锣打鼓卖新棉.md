　　Grain Output Per Mu Exceeds the Highest Target in the National Agricultural Development Program
　　Cixi Peasants Beat Drums and Gongs to Sell New Cotton
    (Our Dispatch) Cixi County in Zhejiang Province, which created a national model for large-area high cotton yield in 1955, has once again delivered good news this year. The county's nearly 500,000 mu of cotton fields are estimated to produce an average of 107.7 jin of unginned cotton per mu. This is an increase of 22.7 jin compared to the average yield of 85 jin of unginned cotton per mu on 520,000 mu of cotton fields in 1955, and exceeds the highest target of 100 jin of unginned cotton per mu set by the National Agricultural Development Program to be achieved within twelve years.
    This year in Cixi County, due to the implementation of various effective measures to increase production in accordance with local conditions, the county's 497,000+ mu of cotton grew well. Although Typhoon hit on August 18, losses were light due to the timely and comprehensive production inspection and the measures taken under the leadership of the local Party and government. Now, cotton farmers throughout the county have begun picking new cotton. Recently, cadres from agricultural technology stations in the county's six major cotton-growing areas went to the fields to conduct inspections and held forums with experienced veteran farmers. They also conducted detailed yield estimates based on several different types in different regions. According to the yield estimates, among the county's six cotton-growing areas, the lowest-yielding Longshan District, with more than 28,000 mu of cotton fields, can also produce an average of 74 jin of unginned cotton per mu, while the highest-yielding Simen District, with more than 83,000 mu of cotton fields, can achieve an average yield of 136 jin of unginned cotton per mu.
    In early September, purchasing stations in various districts of Cixi County began to purchase new cotton, and cotton farmers enthusiastically sold their cotton. For example, the Simen purchasing station planned to collect 20,000 jin per day, but on the first day of state purchase, farmers beat drums and gongs and sold more than 47,000 jin of cotton to the state.

　　亩产量超过农业发展纲要最高指标
　　慈溪农民敲锣打鼓卖新棉
    本报讯  曾经在1955年创造了全国棉田大面积丰产典型的浙江省慈溪县，今年又传来捷报。全县将近五十万亩棉田，估计平均每亩可以产皮棉一百零七点七斤，比它在1955年的五十二万亩棉田平均亩产八十五斤皮棉的这个数字，还提高了二十二点七斤，超过了全国农业发展纲要在十二年内要求达到亩产皮棉一百斤的最高指标。
    今年慈溪县，由于因地制宜地贯彻了各项有效的增产措施，全县四十九万七千多亩棉花，普遍生长良好。8月18日虽然遭到台风侵袭，但在当地党政领导下，及时进行了全面的生产大检查，采取了措施，因此损失很轻。现在全县棉农都开始采摘新棉了。最近这个县六个主要棉区的农业技术站干部，曾经分头到田间进行踏畈和召开有经验的老农座谈会，并且还根据不同地区的几种不同类型，详细地进行了估产工作。根据估产的结果，全县六个棉区当中，产量最低的龙山区，二万八千多亩棉田，平均每亩也可产皮棉七十四斤，产量最高的泗门区，八万三千多亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉可达一百三十六斤。
    9月初，慈溪县各区采购站已开秤收购新棉，棉农投售十分踊跃。如泗门采购站计划日收二万斤，但是国家收购的第一天，农民就敲锣打鼓，把四万七千多斤棉花卖给国家。
