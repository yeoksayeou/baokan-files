    The rectification campaign in industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places is gradually unfolding. In the state-owned enterprises and some joint state-private enterprises in these places, a high tide of "big blooming and big contending" (大鸣大放) has been formed. The big-character posters are dazzling, attracting the attention of the broad masses. Tens of thousands of workers and staff members speak their minds freely through big-character posters, group meetings, and forums, offering straightforward and sharp criticisms of the leadership work and leading cadres of the enterprises. Many enterprises have seriously studied the criticisms and opinions of the workers and staff members in accordance with the spirit of rectifying while correcting, and are actively improving their work. Forty state-owned factories and mines in Beijing have sorted out and summarized more than 15,000 problems from the 500,000 comments made by the workers and staff, and are starting to solve them as the first batch of problems to be addressed. The high tide of "big blooming and big contending" will inevitably bring about a high tide of rectifying while correcting. The healthy atmosphere of "big blooming and big contending" will create a lively situation in enterprises, with both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom. This situation is essential for mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the masses and for improving the leadership work of enterprises.

    The experience of Beijing and other places proves that although our enterprise management work has made great progress in recent years, and the relationship between leaders and the masses is close, there are still many problems in our work. Only by letting the masses speak out freely can we fully expose shortcomings; only by seriously rectifying while correcting can we encourage the enthusiasm of the masses to continue to speak out freely and achieve practical results in the rectification. Therefore, all enterprises that have already launched rectification campaigns should pay special attention to rectifying while correcting; all enterprises that are preparing to launch rectification campaigns should also pay attention to rectifying while correcting while mobilizing the masses to speak out freely.

    Some comrades worry that after the masses are mobilized, the phenomenon of slack discipline will occur, affecting the normal operation of production.

    Of course, carrying out rectification campaigns in enterprises must strictly follow the characteristics of production and ensure that rectification and production are not neglected. And this is entirely possible. The experiences of Beijing and Shanghai have already proven that as long as necessary preparations are made in advance, such as explaining the significance of the rectification to cadres and the masses, especially making the determination to rectify while correcting, the leading cadres actively strengthen contact with the masses, actively solve some of the urgent problems of the masses, and arrange production work well, the movement can develop healthily. In many factories, despite the lively discussions and ideological ferment in front of the big-character poster sheds outside the workshops, once inside the workshops, people still work hard and orderly as usual. In late August, just as Beijing's factories began to enter the high tide of blooming and contending, the city's total industrial output value exceeded the plan by 7.7%, an increase of 12.5% over the total output value of the same period last year. This fact fully demonstrates that as long as the leadership grasps it well, "big blooming and big contending" will not only not affect production, but will also strongly promote production. Workers generally reported that "it is refreshing to speak out freely, and the enthusiasm is also high."

    Will the masses raise a lot of difficult problems to embarrass the leadership? Of course, this situation will occur, but the vast majority of the opinions of the masses are good and basically correct. Among the 500,000 comments made by the workers and staff of 40 state-owned factories and mines in Beijing, the vast majority are from the perspective of improving production management and improving the work style of cadres, accounting for about 66%; opinions on living welfare and wage rewards account for about 20%, most of which should be resolved and can be resolved, but have not been resolved due to the leadership's lack of concern for the lives of the masses and long-term backlog. Now it is not a difficult thing to solve these problems that should be solved and can be solved. The masses raising these problems in "big blooming and big contending" is not to embarrass the leadership, but to greatly urge and help the leadership to improve their work. As long as the leading cadres have the determination to rectify while correcting, how can it be "embarrassing"? Because the vast majority of the opinions of the masses are correct, rectifying while correcting is entirely possible. The workers praised this rectification as "short flowering, quick results." As for some opinions that are correct in principle but cannot be done at present, as long as they are patiently explained to the masses, the understanding of the masses can be obtained.

    Some leaders are afraid of "getting burned" because of relatively serious shortcomings, so they dare not mobilize the masses to speak out freely. However, what is so terrible about getting burned? Since the Communist Party members put the interests of the entire people first, and are determined to sacrifice everything for the cause of the people, is there anything to regret about burning off their shortcomings and mistakes? Isn't it a great thing? It should be recognized that if we do not burn off the shortcomings and mistakes of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, we cannot consolidate the unity of the majority of the masses, we cannot correctly handle the contradictions among the people, and we cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, which will inevitably seriously harm the cause of socialist construction.

    Of course, some wrong opinions and even some absurd remarks will appear in the "big blooming and big contending" in enterprises. This is not surprising and there is nothing to be afraid of. Some people in the masses do not understand the overall situation of the country and the enterprise, and only look at the problem from their own perspective, so their opinions are inevitably wrong; some people are influenced by non-working-class ideas, cannot distinguish between right and wrong, so their opinions are inevitably wrong; and some people were originally not from the working class and have not participated in the ranks of workers for long, so it is even more inevitable to show views that are incompatible with the working class. These wrong opinions and even absurd remarks need to be publicly put forward and handed over to the entire workers and staff to debate. Through mass debates, we can distinguish between right and wrong, refute all fallacies and wrong opinions, and further improve the political consciousness of the working class and give play to the leading role of the working class in socialist construction.

    In the mass debates on the socialist and capitalist roads in enterprises, the working class should have its own clear-cut position. Socialism is the fundamental interest of the working class and the people of the whole country, and it is the great ideal for which the Chinese people have struggled for a long time. Consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and consolidating the leadership of the Party are the basic conditions for realizing socialism. The working class should ruthlessly expose and crush the conspiracies of the bourgeois rightists who attempt to usurp the leadership of the state and restore the feudal system and the capitalist system. We should educate every member of our ranks to maintain a high degree of vigilance in politics, and constantly fight against the harmful behaviors of those bad elements who have mixed into the ranks of workers, and also fight against those wrong opinions that are not conducive to the dictatorship of the proletariat and hinder the leadership of the Party.

    In the process of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the working class must always pay attention to overcoming certain lax phenomena in its ranks, especially pay attention to helping new workers, transforming their original petty-bourgeois ideological style, strengthening organization and discipline, correctly understanding the relationship between the individual and the collective, the individual and the country, and understanding the relationship between freedom and discipline, democracy and centralization, so that its ranks become a conscious, united and combat-effective team. In the big debates in enterprises, it is necessary to guide the masses to fully recognize that without such a team, it is impossible for the working class to maintain its leadership over the people of the whole country.

    In the big debates in enterprises, it is also necessary to make the masses realize that in a large, populous and economically backward country like ours, building socialism must go through a long period of hard struggle. The working class must carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, maintain the noble qualities of being selfless, work hard, be diligent and thrifty, set an example, and lead the people of the whole country to build the country diligently and thriftily, and overcome various difficulties on the road forward. The working class must understand that without the necessary accumulation, production cannot be expanded, and life cannot be gradually improved; and only when the lives of all the people are improved, can the improvement of the lives of the working class be stable and reliable, and not be separated from the majority of the masses, especially the peasant masses.

    After the "big blooming and big contending," rectifying while correcting, the appearance of the enterprise will surely be renewed, and the cause of socialist construction will surely develop more smoothly. This is entirely predictable.

### 在企业中大鸣大放边整边改

    在企业中大鸣大放边整边改
    北京、上海、天津等地工矿企业的整风运动正在逐步开展。这些地方的国营企业和一部分公私合营企业里，大鸣大放已经形成高潮。大字报琳琅满目，吸引着广大群众的注意。成千成万的职工通过大字报、小组会、座谈会畅所欲言，对企业的领导工作和领导干部提出了直爽的、尖锐的批评。许多企业已经根据边整边改的精神，认真地研究了职工们的批评和意见，积极地改进工作。北京四十个国营厂矿企业，已经从职工们提出的五十万条意见中，整理、归纳出一万五千多个问题，列为第一批要解决的问题着手解决。大鸣大放的高潮必将带来边整边改的高潮。大鸣大放的健康风气发展起来，将使企业中形成一种生动活泼的、又有集中又有民主、又有纪律又有自由的生气勃勃的局面。这种局面对于调动群众的生产积极性，对于改进企业的领导工作，都是十分必要的。
    北京等地的经验证明，我们的企业管理工作这几年来虽然有了很大的进步，领导和群众的关系是密切的，但是工作中的问题也还不少，唯有放手发动群众大鸣大放，才能充分揭露缺点；也唯有认真地边整边改，才能鼓励群众继续大鸣大放的积极性，收到整风的实际效果。因此，一切已经开展整风运动的企业，要特别注意边整边改；一切正准备开展整风运动的企业，在发动群众大鸣大放的同时，也要注意边整边改。
    有些同志担心群众发动起来以后，会发生纪律松弛的现象，影响生产的正常进行。
    当然，在企业中进行整风运动，必须严格服从生产的特点，必须做到整风和生产两不误。而这也是完全可以做到的。北京和上海的经验都已经证明，只要事前作好必要的准备工作，如对干部、群众讲清整风的意义，特别是下定边整边改的决心，领导干部主动加强同群众的联系，积极解决群众中的一些迫切的问题，并且安排好生产工作，这样就可以使运动健康地向前发展。许多工厂，尽管在车间外面的大字报棚前，人们议论纷纷，思想沸腾，但一走进车间，人们却照常地紧张地进行劳动，秩序井然。在8月下旬，正当北京各工厂开始进入鸣放高潮的时候，全市工业生产总值超额7.7％完成了计划，比去年同期的总产值提高12.5％。这个事实充分说明了，只要领导上掌握得好，大鸣大放不但不会影响生产，而且会有力地推动生产。工人们普遍反映说：“放得痛快，干劲也大”。
    群众是不是会提出一大堆难题来为难领导呢？这种情况当然会有，但群众的意见绝大多数是好的，基本上是正确的。北京四十个国营厂矿职工所提出的五十万条意见中，绝大多数是从改进生产管理和改进干部作风出发的，这类意见约占66％；属于生活福利和工资奖励方面的意见，约占20％，其中大多数也是应该解决而又可能解决的，只因为过去领导上对群众生活关心不够，长期积压下来没有得到解决。现在要解决这些应该解决而又可能解决的问题，并不是什么困难的事情。群众在大鸣大放中把这些问题提出来，完全不是给领导为难，而是对领导改进工作的莫大的督促和帮助。只要领导干部有边整边改的决心，何至于“为难”？由于群众的意见绝大多数是正确的，所以边整边改就是完全可能的。工人们称赞这次整风是“开花短、结果快”。至于一部分原则上虽然正确，但目前确实办不到的意见，只要向群众耐心解释，也完全可以取得群众的谅解。
    有些领导人员因为有比较严重的缺点，怕“引火烧身”，因而不敢发动群众大鸣大放。然而，引火烧身有什么可怕呢？共产党员既然把全体人民的利益放在第一位，抱定最大的决心，为人民的事业不惜牺牲自己的一切，难道烧掉自己的缺点和错误，还有什么可惜的吗？还不是极大的好事吗？应当认识，如果不把官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的缺点和错误烧掉，我们就不能巩固地团结群众的多数，就不能正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，就不能把广大群众的积极性调动起来，这样就必然会严重地危害社会主义的建设事业。
    当然，在企业的大鸣大放中也会出现一些错误的意见，甚至会出现一些荒谬的言论，这并不奇怪，也没有什么可怕。群众中有些人不了解国家的和企业的全面情况，光从自己的角度来看问题，意见难免错误；有些人受了非工人阶级思想的影响，分不清是非，意见也难免错误；还有些人本来就是非工人阶级出身，参加工人的队伍也不久，更难免表现出同工人阶级格格不入的见解。对于这些错误的意见甚至于荒谬的言论，正需要公开提出来交给全体职工群众去进行辩论。通过群众的大辩论，正好明辨是非，驳倒一切谬论和错误的意见，进一步提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，发挥工人阶级在社会主义建设中的领导作用。
    在企业中的社会主义和资本主义两条道路的群众性的大辩论中，工人阶级应当有自己的鲜明立场。社会主义是工人阶级和全国人民的根本利益，是中国人民为之长期奋斗的伟大理想。巩固无产阶级专政、巩固党的领导，是实现社会主义的基本条件。工人阶级应当无情地揭露和粉碎资产阶级右派企图篡夺国家领导权、恢复封建制度和资本主义制度的阴谋。应当教育自己队伍中每一个成员，在政治上保持高度的警惕性，经常向那些混进工人队伍中的坏分子的危害行为作斗争，也向那些不利于无产阶级专政和妨碍党的领导的错误意见作斗争。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程中，工人阶级必须经常注意克服自己队伍中的某些涣散现象，特别要注意帮助新工人，改造他们原来的小资产阶级的思想作风，加强组织性和纪律性，正确地认识个人和集体、个人和国家的关系，认识自由和纪律、民主和集中的关系，使自己的队伍成为一支有觉悟的、团结的、有战斗力的队伍。在企业的大辩论中，必须引导群众充分地认识，如果没有这样一支队伍，工人阶级要保持自己对全国人民的领导是不可能的。
    在企业的大辩论中，还要使群众认识：在我国这样一个地大、人多、经济落后的国家中，建设社会主义必须经历长时期的艰苦奋斗。工人阶级必须发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，保持大公无私的高贵品质，努力生产，克勤克俭，以身作则，带动全国人民勤俭建国，战胜前进道路上的各种困难。工人阶级必须懂得没有必要的积累，就不能扩大生产，也就不能逐步改善生活；而且只有全体人民的生活都得到改善，工人阶级生活的改善才是稳妥可靠的，才不至于脱离大多数群众首先是农民群众。
    经过大鸣大放，边整边改，企业的面貌必然能够焕然一新，社会主义建设事业必然能够更加顺利地发展。这是完全可以预期的。
