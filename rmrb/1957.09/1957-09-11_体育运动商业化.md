    Commercialization of Sports

    According to the American magazine "The Nation," even sports in the United States are operated in a capitalist manner and controlled by monopoly organizations. The football teams and their games in major cities across the United States are manipulated by two national monopoly organizations. Except for New York and Chicago, most major cities are controlled by a single team monopolized by monopoly organizations, seeking only profit. Other teams with "small capital and meager profits" are gradually eliminated and wiped out in the situation of the big fish eating the small fish.

    As for the popular baseball sport in the United States, it has always been under the autocratic rule of monopoly organizations. These monopoly organizations have a wide variety of "business methods," too numerous to mention. On the one hand, they buy baseball stars at high prices, and on the other hand, they use the trump card of manipulating games to control athletes. "The Nation" magazine described these monopoly organizations as follows: "To manage and maintain such a complex organization, it is really a myriad of things, requiring a large pile of rules that are even longer and more exaggerated than the U.S. Constitution!" In the empire of money, even sports have been commercialized.

    体育运动商业化
    据美国“民族”周刊报道，在美国，连体育运动也是按资本主义经营的方式、由垄断组织所控制的。美国全国各大城市的足球队及其比赛分别由两个全国性的垄断组织所操纵。除了纽约与芝加哥两座大城市以外，其他主要城市大都只由垄断组织所控制的一个球队包揽对外比赛，唯利是图。其他各队“本小利微”，在大鱼吃小鱼的情况下，逐渐被淘汰、消灭。
    至于美国盛行的棒球运动，一直受着垄断组织的专横统治。这些垄断组织的“经营方式”五花八门，不胜枚举。它们一方面高价收买棒球名手，另方面又利用操纵比赛这张王牌来控制运动员。“民族”周刊形容这些垄断组织说：“要管理、维持这样复杂的组织，真是千头万绪，需要比美国宪法还冗长、夸大的一大堆细则才行！”在金元帝国里，连体育运动也商业化了。
