Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th: Due to the serious sentimentalism and right-leaning thought existing among some leading members of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), the anti-Rightist struggle in this organization has been lagging behind.

More than ten days after the CAPD Central Committee's decision on rectification made on June 23rd was conveyed to local organizations, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CAPD had not yet organized a rectification leading group, nor had it promptly studied the anti-Rightist struggle. The reactionary remarks of Wang Feinan, a Rightist element and member of the Standing Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CAPD, had been criticized three times in his work unit – the Xi'an Teachers' Advanced Studies College – but the person in charge of the CAPD provincial committee working at this college had not yet informed the CAPD provincial committee about the criticism of Wang Feinan. When several members of the CAPD provincial committee learned about Wang Feinan's situation and requested to criticize Wang within the association, the person in charge of the CAPD provincial committee still believed that the criticism in the college was almost done, and there was no need to bring it to the association for further criticism. Finally, due to the insistence of a few leftists, Wang Feinan's reactionary remarks were criticized within the association.

Another reason for the slow progress of the anti-Rightist struggle in the CAPD provincial committee is that leading members mistakenly believed that "the CAPD is pure, has good components, and few Rightists." However, the reality is not like this at all. According to the Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from relevant sources, the CAPD provincial committee has developed more than 390 members in the past two years (170 people were developed in the first half of this year alone), and many people with serious historical problems and historical counter-revolutionaries have also been absorbed. Taking only the 26 primary and secondary schools in Xi'an with CAPD organizations or members, among the more than 170 members in these schools, there are 68 historical counter-revolutionaries and class enemies; among the cadres above the level of CAPD group leaders in the schools, there are 24 historical counter-revolutionaries, enemy and puppet military officers, and backbone members of reactionary parties and groups. During the period of great blooming and contending, 19 members expressed reactionary remarks in primary and secondary schools, and 12 of them have been identified as Rightists, including nine who are members of the CAPD grassroots organization committees. In addition, many CAPD members took the opportunity of rectification to stir up trouble and launch wild attacks on the Communist Party and socialism. The CAPD group of Xi'an No. 1 Middle School even attracted more than ten people who had serious historical and political problems to gather and incite them to "pour out their grievances" to the school and the municipal education bureau. Su Yutian (alternate member of the CAPD Central Committee), the principal of Xi'an Experimental Primary School, once publicly stated that major issues in the school should be decided by democratic parties, competing with the Communist Party on equal footing. However, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CAPD did not fully understand these situations. They rarely went to the grassroots to understand the situation, and the grassroots organizations rarely reported to them. This has affected the full-scale development of their anti-Rightist struggle.

### 温情主义和右倾思想在作怪  民进陕西省委反右派斗争迟迟不前

　　温情主义和右倾思想在作怪
　　民进陕西省委反右派斗争迟迟不前
    新华社西安11日电　中国民主促进会陕西省委员会一些领导成员由于存在着严重的温情主义和右倾思想，使得这个组织的反右派斗争迟迟不前。
    民进中央在6月23日作出的整风决定下达到各地方组织十多天后，民进陕西省委还没有组织整风领导小组，也没有及时研究反右派斗争。民进陕西省委常委、右派分子王芾南的反动言行已在工作单位——西安市教师进修学院连续批判了三次，但在这个学院工作的民进省委负责人还没有将批判王芾南的情况告诉民进省委。当民进省委的几个委员知道王芾南的情况并要求在会内对王进行批判时，民进省委负责人还认为学院里批判得差不多了，不用再拿到会里来批判了。最后因少数左派的坚持，王芾南的反动言行才在会内进行了批判。
    民进省委反右派斗争裹足不前的另一个原因，是由于领导成员中错误地认为“民进纯洁、成分好、右派少”。事实上却完全不是这样。据新华社记者从有关方面获悉，民进省委在最近两年来发展了会员三百九十多人（今年上半年就发展了一百七十人），不少有严重历史问题的人和历史反革命分子也被吸收进来。仅以西安市有民进组织或会员的二十六个中小学来看，这些学校的一百七十多名会员中，历史反革命分子和阶级敌对分子就有六十八人；学校内的民进小组长以上干部中，历史反革命分子、敌伪军官及反动党团骨干分子有二十四名。大鸣大放时期，在中小学里发表反动言论的会员就有十九人，已有十二人肯定是右派分子，其中就有九名是民进基层组织的委员。另外还有不少民进会员借整风机会大肆煽风点火，大放厥词向共产党和社会主义进攻。市一中民进小组竟拉拢十多个曾有严重历史政治问题的人集会，煽动他们向学校和市教育局“诉苦水”。西安市实验小学校长苏玉阗（民进中央候补委员）曾公然说学校中的重大问题应由民主党派来决定，和共产党分庭抗礼。而民进陕西省委对于这些情况竟然不完全了解，他们很少到基层了解情况，基层组织也很少向上反映。这就影响他们反右派斗争的全面展开。
