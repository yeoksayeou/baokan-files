This newspaper, Chengdu, 12th: The Sichuan Daily recently exposed the anti-Party words and deeds of Ai Feng, a responsible reporter stationed in Zigong and Neijiang for the newspaper, and a rightist within the Party.

Ai Feng has consistently opposed the Party newspaper adhering to the Party spirit principle and socialist orientation. He believes that Party spirit and the people's character are opposed; that Party spirit represents the Party committee organs, while the people's character represents the voice of the masses. He arrogantly advocated abolishing the Party's leadership over the newspaper.

Ai Feng also slandered today's society as "utterly dark," advocating for ruthlessly exposing the so-called dark side of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said that reporting achievements is "betraying one's conscience." He made many slanderous reports about the work in the Neijiang area, saying things like "cooperatives have no advantages," "agricultural production has declined," and "industrial levels have decreased," and so on. His anti-Party spearhead almost attacked all the factory and mine Party committees in Zigong City.

After the rectification campaign began, Ai Feng greatly praised the Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily, which had taken the bourgeois direction, and promoted the anti-Party clamor of these two newspapers as "bold and unconstrained" and "very outstanding," saying that he was so excited that he couldn't sleep. He repeatedly suggested that the editorial department send people to Wenhui Daily to visit and study.

During this period, Ai Feng colluded with Zhang Yu and others, core members of the right-wing group in Zigong City, inciting trouble everywhere, stealing internal Party secrets, and jointly planning the steps and strategies for attacking the Party day and night.

　　反对党对报纸的领导　恶意攻击新社会
    艾风是右派分子反党的内应
    本报成都12日电　四川日报最近揭露了该报驻自贡、内江负责记者、党内右派分子艾风的反党言行。
    艾风一贯反对党报坚持党性原则和社会主义方向。他认为党性和人民性是对立的，党性是代表党委机关，人民性是代表群众呼声。他狂妄地主张取消党对报纸的领导。
    艾风还诬蔑今天社会是“一片黑暗”，主张无情地揭发所谓无产阶级专政的阴暗面。他说报道成绩就是“昧了良心”。他对内江地区的工作进行了许多诬蔑性的报道，说什么“合作社没有优越性”、“农业减产了”、“工业水平降低了”等等。他的反党矛头几乎攻击了自贡市所有的厂矿党委。
    整风开始后，艾风大为赞扬走上资产阶级方向的光明日报和文汇报，宣扬这两张报纸反党的叫嚣“大胆泼辣”“很出色”，说他甚至激动得睡不着觉，他再三主张编辑部派人去文汇报参观学习。
    在这个期间，艾风和自贡市右派集团骨干分子张宇高等勾结在一起，到处点火，并且盗窃党内的机密，夜以继日地共同策划向党进攻的步骤和策略。
