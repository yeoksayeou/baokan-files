　　On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　Never Forget the Japanese Puppet Regime
　　Liu Guangshi Maliciously Slanders the New Society

　　Rightist element Liu Guangshi of the Aquatic Products Ministry was dissatisfied with everything in the new society. He smeared socialism, claiming it was not as good as the rule of the Japanese puppet regime, and that he himself was not as well off as a slave of a conquered nation. After stern criticism, he then said the new society had "four small bad things": the Three-Anti campaign treated him badly, his political status was bad, his life was bad, and he had no freedom of speech.

　　It has been revealed that Liu Guangshi served as the assistant manager of the Shijiazhuang branch of the puppet Hebei Provincial Bank before liberation, where he embezzled and cheated everywhere, and led a corrupt life. After liberation, he again engaged in embezzlement. He was exposed by the masses during the Three-Anti campaign and demoted. Since this kind of "freedom" was restricted in the new society, it is no wonder he was dissatisfied with everything.

　　Desperately Defending the Capitalist System
　　Yang Yude Extremely Hated the Communist Party

　　Yang Yude of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electricity was a rightist element who joined the work with deep class hatred. He vehemently attacked the leadership of the Communist Party, slandering the great victory of the Chinese revolution as a power grab and a change of rulers. He also advocated that "democratic parties and the Communist Party take turns governing." He desperately defended the American capitalist system, saying, "America is much better than here." He cursed ideological remolding as "using people with little education to provide the least education to people with a lot of education."

　　After four large-scale debate meetings, the masses used theory and facts to dissect Yang Yude's reactionary arguments inch by inch.

　　Communist Party Member Tong Zuoxiang
　　Actually Clamored for Dissolving the Party Branch

　　Tong Zuoxiang, deputy section chief of the Secretarial Section of the Tangshan City Statistics Bureau in Hebei Province and a rightist element within the Party, openly slandered Party members as "plainclothes police" and "secret agents," and arrogantly declared that he wanted to "dissolve the Party branch." He spread rumors everywhere that cadres of the Statistics Bureau were divided into "fragrant, smelly, red, and black" categories, and incited others to "struggle" against the Party's leadership.

　　Tong Zuoxiang also wrote draft speeches attacking the Party for non-Party members, so that non-Party members could read them aloud at the symposium convened by the Municipal Party Committee.

　　Worships Chiang Kai-shek and Praises Hitler
　　Zhang Liangxiu Has Always Been a Reactionary Fellow

　　During the blooming period, Zhang Liangxiu, a French professor in the Department of Western Languages at Sun Yat-sen University and a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, slandered the Communist Party as not being "impartial," but rather "acting in its own selfish interests." He said, "The committee system is a breeding ground for three evils," and also openly clamored that the "reasonable" society in his mind "must stand up" and the "unreasonable" society "must fall down"!

　　Who is Zhang Liangxiu? It has been revealed that he was originally a reactionary fellow who had long betrayed the revolution, always sided with the Kuomintang, and worshiped Chiang Kai-shek and praised Hitler.

　　Qingdao Women's Federation Cadre Sun Yunke
　　Incited Women to Attack the Party

　　The Qingdao Women's Federation revealed that Sun Yunke, under the guise of caring about the interests of women, convened symposiums with some female senior intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the Party, and conducted individual interviews, lighting fires everywhere among women in government agencies and mass organizations, asking women to "pour out their grievances," and collecting materials to attack the Party's various policies and political movements led by the Party. She also tried every means to undermine the prestige of the Communist Party within the Women's Federation, attempting to seize leadership. She even arrogantly spread the fallacy that the Communist Party would "step down next year."

　　在反右派战线上
    念念不忘日伪统治
    刘光世恶意诋毁新社会
    水产部右派分子刘光世，对新社会样样不满。他污蔑社会主义还不如日伪的统治，他自己还不如亡国奴。经严词批驳后，他又说新社会有“四小不好”：三反斗他不好，他的政治地位不好，生活不好，他的言论没有自由。
    据揭露，刘光世在解放前曾任伪河北省银行石家庄分行襄理，到处贪污作弊，生活腐化。解放后他又有贪污情事。三反时被群众揭发，并受到降级处分。由于这种“自由”，在新社会受到了限制，无怪乎他样样不满了。
    竭力为资本主义制度辩护
    杨玉德极端仇恨共产党
    电力部基本建设总局的杨玉德，是带着很深的阶级仇恨参加工作的右派分子。他极力攻击共产党的领导，把中国革命的伟大胜利诬蔑为争权夺利换统治。他还主张“民主党派与共产党轮流执政。”他竭力为美国资本主义制度辩护，说什么：“美国比这里好得多”。他咒骂思想改造是“用受教育少的人对受教育很多的人进行最少的教育”。
    经过四次大型辩论会后，群众用理论和事实把杨玉德的反动论点驳得寸寸肢解。
    共产党员佟作相
    竟叫嚣解散党支部
    河北省唐山市统计局秘书科副科长、党内右派分子佟作相，公开诬蔑党员是“便衣警察”、“特务”，并狂妄地声称要“解散党支部”。他到处散布统计局的干部有“香、臭、红、黑”之分，鼓动别人向党的领导“斗争”。
    佟作相还曾给党外人士写攻击党的发言底稿，让党外人士在市委召开的座谈会上照稿宣读。
    崇拜蒋介石歌颂希特勒
    张良修从来就是反动家伙
    中山大学西语系法语教授、民革成员张良修在鸣放期间，诬蔑共产党不是“天下为公”，而是“天下为私”。“党委制是三害的温床”，还公开叫嚣他心目中的“合理的”社会“要站起来”，“不合理的”社会“倒下去”！
    张良修是什么人呢？据揭露原来是一个早已叛变革命，一直投靠国民党，崇拜蒋介石歌颂希特勒的反动家伙。
    青岛妇联干部孙韵珂
    煽动妇女向党进攻
    青岛市妇联揭露孙韵珂打着关心妇女利益的幌子，通过召集一些对党不满的女高级知识分子举行座谈会和个别访问等形式，在机关和群众团体的妇女中到处点火，要妇女“吐苦水”，搜集向共产党进攻的材料，用以攻击党的各项政策和党领导的各项政治运动。她还在妇联机关内千方百计地打击共产党的威信，企图夺取领导权。她甚至狂妄地散布共产党在“明年下马”的谬论。
