(Reported by this newspaper) In order to cooperate with the socialist ideological education in the countryside, Gaodian Township, Ledu County, Qinghai Province, held a physical object exhibition. The exhibits include more than 200 new items purchased by farmers after the collectivization, such as Pacific bedsheets, satin quilts, rugs, black duffel coats, serge uniforms, poplin shirts, leather shoes, rubber boots, and Changcheng brand thermos bottles; and 40 new Flying Pigeon and Forever brand bicycles. In contrast, there were hundreds of items exhibited such as rotten felt pieces, torn brown jackets, broken old sheepskin coats, sackcloth pieces used by farmers for sleeping and sand pots and wooden bowls for eating before liberation. In addition, there were some white flour and wheat that had been damaged by mice and insects. This was part of the thousands of catties of surplus grain accumulated and wasted by the small landlord Ju Shengfa.

After the exhibition started, many people from the Gaodian Agricultural Cooperative visited. The exhibition was very educational for the members. Yu Bingzhen and Yu Bingyu said: In the past, we talked about the improvement of the lives of cooperative members, but we didn't really understand it deeply. After seeing the exhibition, we really feel that the farmers have turned over completely. Cooperative member Wang Chunkai said excitedly: In the past, who among us poor farmers had ever seen a satin quilt, but today we are covering ourselves with them. Women Bai Yumei, Wang Chunai, Da Xiuzhen, Feng Youyi, Zhao Mei, and Xu Jingguo all said that today's life is a hundred times, a thousand times better than in the old society; they were all in tears when they mentioned the pain of the old society.

This exhibition also gave the cooperative members a concrete education on the idea of the worker-peasant alliance. Cooperative member Yuan Zhongkui said: In the old society, we could only exchange a dou of wheat for a chi of blue cloth, but now a dou can be exchanged for more than four chi. In the past, being able to wear blue cloth was considered the best, but today, with the value of agricultural products increased, we can wear new clothes made of serge, twill, and worsted, cover ourselves with big floral quilts, and spread Pacific bedsheets.

The cooperative members were very angry at the small landlord Ju Shengfa's behavior of not selling surplus grain to the state, which caused waste and loss. Many cooperative members launched a rational struggle against his behavior.

This exhibition has raised the political awareness of many farmers. Cooperative member Yu Jin, who had always been poor at labor, said that after seeing the exhibition, he worked particularly hard. Zhou Wenjie, a member of the second team, volunteered to sell 357 catties of surplus grain after seeing the exhibition.

    雄辩的证人让事实说话
    究竟哪个社会好？
    本报讯　青海省乐都县高店乡为配合农村的社会主义思想教育，举办了一个实物展览会。展品有合作化后农民新添置的太平洋床单、缎被子、花毯、黑二毛皮大衣、呢子制服、府绸汗衫、皮鞋、胶靴、长城牌热水瓶等二百多件；还有飞鸽牌、永久牌的新自行车四十辆；与此对照展出的有解放前农民睡觉用的烂毡片、穿的破褐褂、破老羊皮袄、麻袋片及吃饭用的沙罐、木碗等百十来件。另外还有一些被老鼠、虫吃坏的白面、小麦等等，这是小土地出租者巨生发积存下的几千斤余粮中浪费的一部分。
    展览开始后，到高店农业社参观的人很多。展览会对社员们教育很大。余秉真、余秉玉说：从前谈社员生活提高了，但总是体会不深，看了展览，确实感到农民是大大的翻身了。社员王春凯激动地说：过去咱们贫穷农民谁见过缎被子，今天却盖上了。妇女白玉梅、王春爱、达秀珍、冯友义、赵梅、许靖国等都说今天生活比旧社会好百倍、千倍；一提起旧社会的痛苦，他们都泣不成声。
    这个展览会，还使社员们受到一次具体的工农联盟的思想教育。社员袁中奎说：旧社会咱们一斗麦子才换一尺毛蓝布，现在一斗能换四尺多。从前能穿个毛蓝布就算顶好的了，今天农产品值了钱，咱们才穿上哔叽的、斜纹的、华达呢的新衣服，盖上大花被子、铺上太平洋的床单子。
    社员们对小土地出租者巨生发有余粮不卖给国家，以致造成浪费损失的行为很气愤。不少社员对他的这种行为展开了说理斗争。
    这个展览会提高了许多农民的政治觉悟。社员余金选过去一贯劳动不好，看了展览后表示干起活来特别卖力气。二队社员周文杰看了展览后自动报名要卖出三百五十七斤余粮。
