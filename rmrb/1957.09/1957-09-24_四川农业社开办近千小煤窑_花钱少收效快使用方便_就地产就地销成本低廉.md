    Sichuan Agricultural Cooperatives Open Nearly a Thousand Small Coal Mines
    Little Investment, Quick Results, Convenient Use, Local Production and Sales, Low Cost

    (Our newspaper, Chengdu) Sichuan agricultural cooperatives have opened nearly a thousand small coal mines, meeting the needs of rural coal use during the peak season.

    After collectivization, Sichuan has generally been focusing on closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation, accumulating fertilizer, and developing sideline occupations, resulting in a decrease in firewood sources and a significant increase in coal consumption. Since the fourth quarter of last year, coal supply has been tight. Yongchuan once adopted a planned coal supply method, providing an average of five to eight kilograms of coal per person per month, meeting only half of the demand. Therefore, Sichuan counties are relying on agricultural cooperatives to develop small coal mines to supplement the insufficient capacity of local coal mines and meet the growing coal needs of rural areas.

    These small coal mines are operated by agricultural cooperatives as seasonal sideline businesses, requiring little investment and yielding quick results. They can fully utilize scattered resources and the cooperatives' idle funds and surplus labor, saving state investment. The ninety-one small coal mines opened by agricultural cooperatives in Chongqing, Weiyuan, Zizhong, Ba County, Yongchuan and other places produce 125 tons per day, requiring an investment of just over 30,000 yuan, while the industrial departments of the special district and county need to invest more than 120,000 yuan to restore small coal mines with the same output. Each cooperative in Chongqing averages 3.09 tons of coal per day, and each cooperative in Ba County averages 0.52 tons, which can be sold externally in addition to self-sufficiency. Since agricultural cooperatives provide labor, non-staple food, timber and tools, and are producing and selling locally, they can reduce circulation costs, so the cost is generally half that of special and county coal mines.

    Strengthening leadership and management is the key issue in the current development of small coal mines. Some counties and districts did not have a clear understanding of the policy of boldly relying on agricultural cooperatives to develop small coal mines, fearing damage to national resources and market impact from overdevelopment. Therefore, they only passively controlled rather than actively leading the already developed small coal mines, resulting in some unnecessary losses of manpower and materials. Due to insufficient active leadership and overall planning, there have also been instances of cooperatives competing with special and county industries, and cooperatives competing with each other for resources. Now, the relevant departments in Sichuan Province have promptly corrected the above shortcomings, and instructed the agricultural departments of each county to strengthen specific leadership over the small coal mines; the county industrial departments are focusing on providing technical safety guidance.

    四川农业社开办近千小煤窑
    花钱少收效快使用方便　就地产就地销成本低廉
    本报成都讯　四川农业社开办近千个小煤窑，满足了旺季农村用煤需要。
    合作化后，四川各地普遍封山育林、积肥和发展副业，柴源减少，用煤量大增。从去年第四季度起，煤炭供应紧张。永川曾采取计划供煤的办法，平均每人每月供煤五到八公斤，仅满足需要的一半。因此，四川各县依靠农业社发展小煤窑，以补助地方煤矿力量不足和满足农村日益增长的用煤需要。
    这批小煤窑是农业社作为季节性副业经营的，花钱少、收效快，可以充分利用零星资源和农业社闲散资金、剩余劳力，节省国家投资。重庆、威远、资中、巴县、永川等地农业社开办的九十一个小煤窑，日产一百二十五吨，只需投资三万多元，而专区和县的工业部门修复同等产量的小煤窑，则需投资十二万多元。重庆每社平均日产煤三点零九吨，巴县每社平均零点五二吨，除自给，还可外销。由于农业社供给人工、副食品、木材用具，又是当地生产当地销售，可以减少流通费用，所以成本一般比专县煤矿低一半。
    加强领导管理是当前发展小煤窑的关键问题。部分县区曾对放手依靠农业社发展小煤窑的方针认识不明确，怕破坏国家资源，怕搞多了冲击市场，因此只消极控制，而不积极领导已经发展起来的小煤窑，以致造成一些不必要的人力物力的损失。由于积极领导、统筹安排不够，社与专县工业、社与社争资源的现象也有发生。现在四川省有关部门已及时纠正上述缺点，并责成各县农业部门加强对小煤窑的具体领导；县工业部门着重给予技术安全指导。　（饶学成）
