Accept Lessons, Strengthen Party Spirit
　　An Ziwen

　　The current anti-Rightist struggle led by the Communist Party in our country is a continuation of our country's great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts and is an extremely acute and fierce class struggle. In this struggle, every Communist Party member's stance, ideology, and viewpoints will be tested in practice. The great blooming and contending and the anti-Rightist struggle have proven that the majority of our Communist Party members are firm communists. They can lead the masses to resolutely counter the Rightist elements' rampant attacks and defend the Party and socialism. However, it has also exposed that some Communist Party members have unstable stances, right-leaning thoughts, and even a very few who have betrayed the proletarian revolutionary cause and oppose the Party, the people, and socialism. These people, whose political features are completely the same as those of the Rightist elements outside the Party, i.e., anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, are the Rightist elements within the Party. Some of them organize anti-Party cliques and carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities; some actively support the speeches and actions of the bourgeois Rightists, slander and insult the Party organization, and attack and defame the socialist system; some have serious hostile emotions towards the counterattack against the Rightists and openly obstruct or sabotage the anti-Rightist struggle; some collude secretly with the bourgeois Rightists, deliver intelligence, and engage in conspiracies; some, under the attack of the bourgeois Rightists, lose their stance, defect, and publish anti-Party remarks; some have serious individualism, have always been dissatisfied with the Party, and take the opportunity to stir up trouble and attack and slander the Party organization; some organize and instigate the masses to make trouble, in order to oppose the Party and socialism. In the acute class struggle, they have become traitors to the Party. Although this kind of Rightist element within the Party is a very small minority, their harm to the Party's cause is extremely serious.

    According to the analysis of 129 Rightist elements within the Party in Beijing and Anhui, the reasons why they oppose the Party are roughly as follows: (1) They themselves come from landlord, rich peasant, or bourgeois families, adhere to the reactionary class stance, or their relatives were suppressed, controlled, or struggled against, and therefore they have a strong hatred for the Party. There are 67 people in this category, accounting for 52.1%;
　　
    (2) Their own history is unclear, their social relations are complicated, they were struggled against or investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, or they were subjected to Party disciplinary action for serious mistakes, and therefore they are seriously dissatisfied with the Party. There are 26 people in this category, accounting for 20%; (3) Due to their impure motives for joining the Party, serious individualism has not been satisfied. There are 32 people in this category, accounting for 24.8%; due to their very low political consciousness, vague stance, and inability to distinguish between right and wrong, they surrendered and defected under the rampant attack of Rightist elements outside the Party, and degenerated into Rightist elements. There are 4 people in this category, accounting for 3.1%. This situation clearly shows that a Communist Party member becomes a Rightist element and engages in anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities, which has its class roots, social roots, and ideological roots. Our Party is the advanced force of the working class, but many of our members come from non-proletarian classes. Although the Party often pays attention to strictly selecting and educating Party members, it cannot completely prevent some unreliable elements from mixing into the Party, nor can it completely prevent the degeneration and deterioration of some Party members.

    Of course, it is a bad thing that Rightist elements have emerged in our Party. This shows that our Party organization is not pure enough, and there are still some diseased abscesses corroding our Party's healthy body. But when the true face of the anti-Party and anti-socialist Rightist elements within the Party is exposed, we must carry out a resolute struggle against them to make the Party ranks more pure and the Party organization more consolidated. And this gives us a lesson to educate every Party member and improve our level of Marxism-Leninism. In this sense, bad things turn into good things.

    Rightist elements are people who educate us from the opposite side and are our "teachers." Every Party member can learn lessons from the exposed Rightist elements, improve vigilance, better transform themselves, and improve their political level.

    What lessons should we Communist Party members learn from the already exposed Rightist elements within the Party?

    To be a Communist Party member worthy of the name, one must unswervingly stand on the proletarian position and must establish a communist worldview.

    Judging from the situation of the exposed Rightist elements within the Party, ideological transformation, standing firmly on the proletarian position, and establishing a communist worldview are very important for every Communist Party member. This is especially important for Party members from exploiting-class families. We are not believers in the theory of pure components. We believe that the social origin of a Party member alone cannot determine everything. What is decisive is our Party's political struggle and political life, our Party's ideological and political education and ideological and political leadership. In fact, after joining our Party, and after a long period of training, most people of non-proletarian origin have accepted Marxism-Leninism, changed their original character, and become proletarian fighters. Many of them sacrificed their lives for the cause of the Party and the people. But this does not mean that social origin has no important meaning. People's ideology often lags behind objective social existence. The ideological consciousness formed in the thousands of years of private ownership society has considerable persistence and tenacity. When the private ownership of the means of production has been transformed into public ownership, the ideological consciousness of maintaining and cherishing private ownership that remains in some people has not changed immediately. Experience has proven that many Party members of non-proletarian origin, especially many Party members of exploiting-class origin, have varying degrees of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought. After joining the Party, they still have countless connections with their original classes and are often influenced by bourgeois thought. Therefore, before their thinking is seriously transformed, they always stubbornly show the face of their original class, and always consciously or unconsciously replace the proletarian worldview with the bourgeois worldview to view problems. This situation is most obvious when the revolutionary situation, tasks, and nature change, and various social forces are reorganized. In our country, thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the proletariat successfully realized the direct transformation of the bourgeois democratic revolution into a proletarian socialist revolution through peaceful means in the democratic revolution stage when it had already obtained national power. The socialist revolution was victorious without bloodshed, which is naturally the great happiness of the Chinese people. However, precisely because the change of the economic base was achieved through peaceful methods, and there was no fierce class struggle in politics and ideology, that is to say, there was no thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, those who did not approve of and opposed the socialist revolution remained within the revolutionary ranks in a hypocritical way during the socialist revolution period. Although these people are in the Communist Party, they are dreaming of capitalism. Therefore, when the socialist road and the capitalist road, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, are currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle, some class alien elements who have infiltrated the Party and those who only approve of the democratic revolution but oppose the socialist revolution will naturally easily expose their anti-Party and anti-socialist prototypes, and some Party members of exploiting-class origin with serious bourgeois ideas also show serious wavering and weakness. These facts fully illustrate that if a Party member of non-proletarian origin, especially a Party member of exploiting-class origin, wants to be a fighter who truly fights heroically for the communist cause for life, he must be determined to carry out thorough ideological transformation, abandon the bourgeois stance and viewpoints without any nostalgia, and resolutely establish the proletarian stance and viewpoints. This requires us Party members, especially new Party members, to study Marxism-Leninism seriously rather than superficially, go to the great storm of mass movements sincerely rather than half-heartedly, serve the workers and peasants wholeheartedly, learn from the workers and peasants, unite with the workers and peasants, and establish deep feelings with the workers and peasants. Only in this way can one truly transform and train oneself, establish a proletarian stance, become a true Marxist-Leninist, and stand firm in the turbulent waves and distinguish right from wrong.

    To be a Communist Party member worthy of the name, one must have a selfless revolutionary spirit and must constantly oppose and overcome bourgeois individualism.

    From the above materials from Beijing and Anhui, we can see that the reason why Communist Party members become Rightist elements within the Party, in addition to the class alien elements and unreliable elements who originally infiltrated the Party, a considerable number of Rightist elements within the Party have further developed from ideologically serious bourgeois individualism to political Rightists. Some of them cannot always maintain a selfless revolutionary spirit, are influenced by bourgeois ideas, and are concerned about personal reputation, status, grade treatment, and material enjoyment. When personal desires are not satisfied, they become resentful and dissatisfied with the Party. Some people were struggled against, investigated, or disciplined for serious mistakes in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, and such handling was completely correct, but they themselves believed that they had been "wronged," and therefore harbored resentment against the Party. There are also some people who were indeed wronged in the "Three-Anti" and Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaigns or received excessive punishment for some mistakes, but the leadership has publicly admitted the mistakes to those who were wrongly injured and restored their reputation, or changed their excessive punishment. This should have won their understanding, but some people with individualism resent endlessly and have since formed hatred with the Party. These people with serious individualistic thoughts and dissatisfaction with the Party often cannot correctly analyze things and observe problems, nor can they correctly handle the relationship between individuals and the Party organization, and the relationship between individuals and the masses. They only see the dark side, but not the bright side. They only find shortcomings and deny achievements. They relish words and deeds that are not conducive to the Party and turn a deaf ear to speeches that support and praise the Party. Therefore, they gradually degenerate from resentment and complaints against the Party to colluding with Rightist elements. This is the path taken by some Communist Party members from bourgeois individualism to Rightist elements within the Party. Counter-revolutionary elements and Rightist elements know very well that fortresses are most easily breached from within. Therefore, they try every means and painstakingly look for the gaps in the Party and destroy and disintegrate the Party organization from within. Those who are dissatisfied with the Party and have serious individualism are precisely the targets they hunt, and these people within the Party are most easily used by counter-revolutionary elements and Rightist elements and become their prisoners.

    Of course, this does not mean that everyone with individualistic tendencies will develop into Rightist elements. There is naturally a big distance and difference between Rightist elements and Party members who only have individualistic tendencies. However, Rightist elements within the Party are all people with extremely serious bourgeois individualism, and Rightist elements grow and develop on the basis of bourgeois individualism. We know that small loopholes in the dike can turn into big breaches, leading to floods. Small mistakes in thought can also develop into big mistakes. If individualistic thoughts are not corrected in time and allowed to develop, one day they will develop into anti-Party Rightist elements under appropriate soil and climate. Many facts tell us that if a Communist Party member has serious individualism and dissatisfaction with the Party, his bourgeois thoughts will inevitably grow like weeds getting rain and dew, until he goes to the opposite side of communism. This is the inevitable development law of some Communist Party members from ideological reaction to political reaction.

    Communist Party members must constantly fight against bourgeois ideas. The growth of individualism in a Party member's thinking means that there is still bourgeois thought in his mind, and its position is still expanding, while the proletarian ideological position is shrinking. Therefore, a Communist Party member must always be vigilant about the dangers of individualism, strive to overcome all manifestations of individualism in himself, and must have the spirit of preventing problems before they arise. When individualism has not developed to such a serious degree, it must be subjected to irreconcilable struggle and overcome. Only in this way can a Communist Party member always maintain a selfless revolutionary spirit, serve the people wholeheartedly, and be a qualified Communist Party member.

    To be a Communist Party member worthy of the name, one must study tirelessly, always maintain vigor, and always have a strong revolutionary will. From the above materials from Beijing and Anhui, it can also be seen that a very small number of Communist Party members, due to their usual unwillingness to study, low class consciousness, and the corrosion of bourgeois ideas, cannot maintain a strong revolutionary will and cannot stand firmly on the proletarian position. They cannot withstand great storms, and therefore, at the critical moment of the struggle, they betray the proletarian revolutionary cause. This is something that every one of our Party members should be vigilant about!

    Now a small number of Party members are content with the status quo, do not seek progress, and are unwilling to improve their political level and professional ability. They think that the revolution has been successful, and therefore they hold a negative attitude towards the socialist revolution and construction. Some Party members only care about business and do not care about political issues, thinking that the class struggle has ended, the world is already peaceful, and political life has become an extra burden. There are even Party members who are determined not to read the Party's newspapers, for fear that the Party's political remarks will have some influence on him. There is also a kind of person who only cares about the trivial matters of life under his nose and ignores national affairs. They have begun to become short-sighted and indiscriminate philistines. These Party members have lost their vigor, lost the soul of Marxism-Leninism, their revolutionary will has declined, and they have reached the edge of falling off the revolutionary train. If they do not wake up early, completely correct their shortcomings, and truly cheer up, they may embark on the road of betraying the proletarian revolutionary cause. Therefore, if a Communist Party member wants to always keep up with the revolutionary wheel and always be a Communist Party member worthy of the name, he must constantly study, he must have vigor, he must have a strong revolutionary will, and he must have the spirit of not being afraid of difficulties and overcoming difficulties with unyielding will. Every Communist Party member should strive to train himself to be a person who loves to study and loves to work, who has both social struggle knowledge and production struggle knowledge, who has both creativity and discipline, who is both lively and strong, and who has infinite loyalty to the Party and the socialist cause. To be such a Communist Party member, in addition to striving to study Marxism-Leninism and various professional knowledge, one must always maintain close ties with the people, participate in the Party's actual life and the people's actual struggle. In Party life, in actual work, regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, regularly obtain the supervision and help of Party organizations and the masses, and use great effort and sincerity to correct one's own mistakes and shortcomings, improve work methods, improve work ability, and improve political and ideological levels. At present, every Communist Party member should actively participate in the rectification movement, participate in the anti-Rightist struggle, and participate in this national debate, in order to undergo great tests and great training in the great storm of mass movements. Only in study and in actual struggle can one truly increase one's Party spirit and revolutionary will, firm the proletarian communist stance, and establish a communist worldview. Only when a Communist Party member has established a communist worldview and has a strong revolutionary will can he resist the erosion of bourgeois ideas and overcome individualism, departmentalism, absolute egalitarianism, and liberalism, and can he work hard and happily for the communist cause with full vigor.

　　接受教训，增强党性
　　安子文
    当前我国人民在共产党领导下进行的反右派斗争是我国伟大的社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线上的继续，是一场极其尖锐激烈的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，每个共产党员的立场、思想、观点都要受到实际的考验。在大放大鸣和反右派斗争中，证明我们的大多数共产党员是坚定的共产主义者。他们能够领导群众坚决地反击右派分子的猖狂进攻，捍卫党和社会主义。但是也暴露出一部分共产党员立场不稳，思想右倾，甚至有极少数背叛了无产阶级革命事业而反党、反人民、反社会主义的人。这些和党外右派分子的政治面貌完全相同，即反党反人民反社会主义的人，就是党内的右派分子。他们有的组织反党小集团，进行反党反社会主义的活动；有的积极支持资产阶级右派的言论行动，诬蔑谩骂党的组织，攻击诋毁社会主义制度；有的对反击右派有严重的敌对情绪，并且公开阻挠或者破坏反击右派的斗争；有的同资产阶级右派暗中勾结，递送情报，进行密谋策划；有的在资产阶级右派进攻下，丧失立场，倒戈叛变，发表反党言论；有的有严重的个人主义，一贯对党不满，在这次斗争中乘机兴风作浪，对党组织进行攻击和污蔑；有的组织和煽动群众闹事，借以反党反社会主义。他们在尖锐的阶级斗争中，成了党的叛徒。这种党内的右派分子虽然是极少数，但他们对党的事业的危害，却是极其严重的。
    根据北京、安徽两地对一百二十九个党内右派分子的分析，他们所以要反党，大致有以下几种原因：（一）本人出身于地主、富农、资产阶级家庭，坚持反动阶级立场，或者他们本人的亲属被镇压、被管制、被斗争，因而对党怀有强烈仇恨。属于这类的有六十七人，占52.1％；
  （二）本人历史不清楚，社会关系复杂，在肃反中被斗争、或者被审查，或因犯过严重错误而受过党纪处分，因而对党严重不满。属于这类的有二十六人，占20％；（三）由于本人入党动机不纯，严重的个人主义没有得到满足。属于这类的有三十二人，占 24.8％；由于政治觉悟很低，立场模糊，是非不分，在党外右派分子的猖狂进攻下，投降叛变，堕落蜕化成为右派分子，属于这类的有四人，占3.1％。这个情况，十分明显地说明一个共产党员所以会变成右派分子而进行反党反人民反社会主义的活动，是有其阶级根源、社会根源和思想根源的。我们的党是工人阶级先进的部队，但是我们的许多党员是出身于非无产阶级的其它阶级的。党虽然经常注意严格地挑选党员和教育党员，但是究竟不能完全防止一些不可靠的分子混入党内，也不能完全防止一些党员的堕落变质。
    当然，在我们党内出了右派分子，这是坏事。这说明我们党的组织还不够纯洁，还有一些带病菌的脓包在腐蚀着我们党的健康的机体。但是当党内右派分子的反党反社会主义的真正面目暴露出来以后，我们就要同他们进行坚决的斗争，使党的队伍更加纯洁，党的组织更加巩固。并且使我们得到了教训，用以教育每个党员，提高我们的马克思列宁主义水平。在这个意义上坏事就变成了好事。
    右派分子是从反面教育我们的人，是我们的“教员”。每个党员都可以从暴露出来的右派分子中吸取教训，提高警惕，更好地改造自己，提高自己的政治水平。
    我们共产党员从已经暴露出来的党内右派分子中应该接受一些什么教训呢？
    一个共产党员要能成为名副其实的共产党员，就必须坚定不移地站在无产阶级立场上，就必须确立共产主义的世界观。
    从已经暴露出来的党内右派分子的情况来看，进行思想改造，站稳无产阶级立场和确立共产主义的世界观，对于每一个共产党员，都是十分重要的。特别是对于剥削阶级家庭出身的党员是尤其重要的。我们不是唯成分论者，我们认为仅仅是党员的社会出身并不能决定一切，而决定性的东西，是我们党的政治斗争和政治生活，是我们党的思想政治教育和思想政治领导。事实上，非无产阶级出身的人，在加入我们党以后，在经过长时期的锻炼以后，大多数人接受了马克思列宁主义的教育，改变了他们原来的性格，成为无产阶级的战士，其中有许多人为了党和人民的事业，牺牲了他们的生命。但是这绝不是说社会出身就没有重要的意义。人们的思想意识是往往落后于客观的社会存在的。在几千年来的私有制社会中所形成的思想意识，是有相当的坚持性和顽固性的，而在生产资料私有制已经变为公有制的时候，存留在若干人们中的维护私有制、留恋私有制的思想意识并不是立即改变了的。经验证明，不少非无产阶级出身的党员，特别是不少的剥削阶级出身的党员，都有不同程度的资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想。他们入党以后同他们原来的阶级还有千丝万缕的连系，经常受着资产阶级思想的影响。因此，在他们的思想没有认真改造之前，他们总是要顽强地表现自己原来阶级的面貌，总是自觉不自觉地以资产阶级的世界观来代替无产阶级的世界观来看问题。这种情况，在革命形势、任务、性质发生变化，各种社会力量重新改组的时候，表现得最为明显。在我国，由于在共产党的英明领导下，在民主革命阶段中无产阶级就取得了全国范围的政权，因而成功地实现了把资产阶级民主革命经过和平道路直接转变为无产阶级的社会主义的革命。社会主义革命没有经过流血而取得胜利，这自然是中国人民的大幸福。可是，正由于经济基础的改变是通过和平方法来实现的，而在政治上和思想上并没有经过激烈的阶级斗争，也就是说在政治战线上和思想战线上还没有经过彻底的社会主义革命，因此就使那些不赞成和反对社会主义革命的人，在社会主义革命时期，仍然貌合神离地留在革命队伍内部。这些人虽然置身于共产党之中，却作着资本主义的梦。因此，当目前社会主义道路同资本主义道路、无产阶级同资产阶级进行你死我活的斗争的时候，一些混入党内的阶级异己分子和只赞成民主革命而反对社会主义革命的人，自然就容易暴露出他们反党反社会主义的原形，一些剥削阶级出身而有严重的资产阶级思想的党员，也表现了严重的动摇和软弱。这些事实充分说明，一个非无产阶级出身的党员，特别是剥削阶级出身的党员，要想真正作一个终身为共产主义事业而英勇奋斗的战士，就必须下定决心，进行彻底的思想改造，毫不留恋地丢掉资产阶级的立场观点，毅然决然地树立起无产阶级的立场和观点。这就要求我们这些党员特别是新党员，认真地而不是皮毛地学习马克思列宁主义，诚心诚意地而不是三心二意地到群众运动的大风暴中去，为工农群众服务，向工农群众学习，同工农群众结成一体，打成一片，同工农群众建立起深厚的感情。只有这样，才可能使自己得到真正的改造和锻炼，才能确立无产阶级立场，成为真正的马克思列宁主义者，也才能在惊涛骇浪中站稳立场，明辨是非。
    要作一个名副其实的共产党员，就一定要有大公无私的革命精神，一定要经常不断地反对和克服资产阶级个人主义。
    从上述北京和安徽两地的材料中，我们可以看出，共产党员之所以变成党内右派分子，除了原来就是混入党内的阶级异己分子和不可靠的分子以外，有相当数目的党内右派分子，都是从思想上严重的资产阶级个人主义进一步发展成为政治上的右派的。他们有的人不能始终一贯地保持大公无私的革命精神，受了资产阶级思想的影响，斤斤计较个人的名誉、地位、级别待遇和物质享受，在个人欲望得不到满足的时候，就对党怨恨不满起来。有的人在三反肃反等运动中被斗、被审查或者因犯过严重错误受到处分，而这种处理又是完全正确的，但是他们本人却认为受到“委屈”，因而就对党怀恨在心。还有的人在“三反”和肃反等运动中确实受了一些委屈或者因为犯了某种错误而受到过重的处分，但领导上已经向错伤的人公开承认了错误，恢复了他们的名誉，或者改变了他们过重的处分，这本来应该取得他们的谅解，但是一些有个人主义的人，却怨恨不已，从此同党结了仇恨。这些有着严重的个人主义思想和对党不满的人，就往往不能正确地分析事物和观察问题，也往往不能正确地处理个人同党组织的关系、个人同群众的关系。他们只看见阴暗面，看不见光明面，尽找缺点，否认成绩。他们对不利于党的言行津津有味，对拥护和赞颂党的言论充耳不闻，于是他们就逐渐由对党的怀恨在心，埋怨不已，终于堕落到同右派分子同流合污。这就是某些共产党员由资产阶级个人主义发展成为党内右派分子所经过的途径。反革命分子、右派分子十分懂得堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的，因此，他们千方百计、处心积虑地寻找党的空隙，从内部来破坏和瓦解党的组织。那些对党不满、有严重个人主义的人，正是他们猎取的对象，而党内这种人也最容易被反革命分子和右派分子所利用，并成为他们的俘虏。
    当然，这并不是说凡是有个人主义倾向的人，都会发展成为右派分子，右派分子和仅仅有个人主义倾向的党员之间，自然是有很大的距离和差别的。但是，党内右派分子却都是具有极端严重的资产阶级个人主义思想的人，右派分子正是在资产阶级个人主义思想基础上生长和发展起来的。我们知道，堤防上的小漏洞会变成大的决口，导致泛滥成灾。思想上的小错误，也可以发展成大错误。如果对个人主义思想，不作及时的纠正，任其发展下去，有朝一日它就会在适当的土壤和气候下，发展成反党的右派分子。许多实事告诉我们，一个共产党员如果有了严重的个人主义，和对党的不满情绪，他的资产阶级思想必然要像毒草得着雨露滋润一样而日益蔓生起来，直到走到共产主义的反面。这是一些共产党员由思想上的反动走上政治上的反动的必然发展规律。
    共产党员必须经常同资产阶级思想作斗争。个人主义在一个党员思想中的滋长，就意味着在他脑子里还有资产阶级思想，而且它的阵地还在扩张，而无产阶级思想阵地却在缩小。因此，一个共产党员必须时时刻刻警惕个人主义的危害，努力克服个人主义在自己身上的一切表现，并且一定要有防微杜渐的精神。在个人主义还没发展到那末严重程度的时候，就必须对它进行不调和的斗争，加以克服。只有这样，一个共产党员才能永远保持大公无私的革命精神，全心全意地为人民服务，才算是一个合格的共产党员。
    要作一个名副其实的共产党员，就一定要孜孜不倦地学习，永远保持朝气，永远具有坚强的革命意志。从上述北京和安徽的材料中，也可以看出，有极少数的共产党员由于平时不肯学习，阶级觉悟很低，并受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀，因而他们就不能保持坚强的革命意志，不能站稳无产阶级的立场，他们经不起大风大浪，因而在斗争的紧要关头，就背叛无产阶级的革命事业。这是值得我们每个党员如何的警惕啊！
    现在有少数党员，安于现状，不求进步，不愿提高自己的政治水平和业务能力。他们以为革命已经成功了，因而对社会主义的革命事业和建设事业抱着消极态度。也有的党员只管业务不关心政治问题，认为阶级斗争已经结束，天下已经太平了，政治生活已经变成额外负担了。甚至有这样的党员，他下了决心不看党的报纸，生怕党的政治言论，对他有所影响。还有一种人只关心眼皮下面的生活琐事，对国家大事不闻不问，他们已经开始变成鼠目寸光、是非不分的庸人。这些党员已经丧失朝气，丧失了马克思列宁主义的灵魂，革命意志已经衰退，他们已经到了从革命列车上掉下去的边缘。如果他们不及早警醒，彻底改正自己的缺点，真正振作起来，就可能走上背叛无产阶级革命事业的道路。因此一个共产党员要想永远跟上革命的车轮前进，要想永远作一个名副其实的共产党员，就一定要不断地学习，就一定要有朝气，一定要有坚强的革命意志，一定要有不怕困难和百折不挠的意志去克服困难的精神。每个共产党员都应该争取把自己锻炼成为既爱学习又爱劳动，既有社会斗争知识又有生产斗争知识，既有创造性又有纪律性，既活泼又坚强，对党和社会主义事业具有无限忠心的人。要作一个这样的共产党员，除了努力学习马克思列宁主义和各种业务知识以外，还必须始终一贯地密切连系人民群众，参加党的实际生活和群众的实际斗争。在党的生活中，在实际工作中，经常开展批评和自我批评，经常取得党的组织和群众的监督与帮助，并用大力用诚心来改正自己的错误缺点，改善工作方法，提高工作能力，提高政治水平和思想水平。在目前每一个共产党员更应该积极地参加整风运动，参加反右派斗争，参加这一次全民性的大辩论，以便在群众运动的大风暴中经受大考验和大锻炼。只有在学习中，在实际斗争中才能真正增加自己的党性和革命意志，坚定无产阶级的共产主义的立场，确立共产主义的世界观。一个共产党员也只有在确立了共产主义的世界观和具有了坚强的革命意志的时候，才能够抵抗资产阶级思想的侵蚀和克服个人主义、本位主义、绝对平均主义和自由主义，也才能够朝气十足地、活泼愉快地为共产主义事业而努力奋斗。
