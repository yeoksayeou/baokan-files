Plotting to Usurp Leadership of Map Compilation and Publishing
The Counter-Revolutionary Faces of Zhang Gaowei and Ge Suicheng Exposed

    (Our Dispatch) In the struggle against the rightists, the Map Publishing House has exposed the rightist Zhang Gaowei, who妄想 attempted to usurp the leadership of the people's map compilation and publishing事业事业, and Ge Suicheng, who frantically set fires. It is now conducting reasoned criticism against these two rightists.

    Zhang Gaowei is a cartographic technician at the Map Publishing House and a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK). He believed that the Communist Party's rectification was because it was "on the eve of the Hungarian incident" and would later "open up the government." Therefore, he wanted to "participate in the joint leadership of the Map Publishing House as a member of a democratic party" to gradually usurp the leadership of the Map Publishing House.

    Zhang Gaowei launched a comprehensive attack from the Party's leadership to its policies. He slandered the Party's leadership of the country as "one-party dictatorship." He advocated that "democratic parties must be able to truly exist independently and come up with political propositions that conform to their class base to confront the Party." He falsely accused that within the Communist Party, "it is also a minority of people who lead and a minority of people who decide everything," and that "the Party is fundamentally untrustworthy." He was originally a backbone element of a reactionary party团伙团伙 who was treated leniently by the government, but he repaid kindness with hatred, slandering that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement is the sum of the three majorisms." He threatened the organization to restore his so-called "reputation" and incited those "who have been rectified and struggled against" in the past to settle scores with the Party.

    Ge Suicheng is an editor at the Map Publishing House and a member of the Jiusan Society. At the beginning of the Party's rectification, he incited those who were dissatisfied with their wages to "settle accounts" with the Party. He wanted the Party member editor-in-chief to step down "to study for four or five years." He also cursed the activists who "didn't even fart" during the blooming and contending, putting pressure on the activists to attack the Party.

    It is revealed that Zhang Gaowei was introduced to the Kuomintang by Chen Lifu and Ye Chucang, heads of the Central Unification Bureau, and had obtained a special party certificate. He also served as an alternate member of the Beibei District Party Headquarters directly under the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters, and as a secretary. He personally produced maps for the "suppression of communists" in Jiangxi. After joining the Map Publishing House, he consistently engaged in anti-Party activities, spreading anti-Soviet and anti-communist fallacies. Ge Suicheng had served as the Dean of Students at Yingshi University and the Secretary of the Kuomintang Yingshi University District Party Headquarters, and he was also a lawless local tyrant and landlord.

　　阴谋篡夺地图编绘出版事业的领导权
　　章高炜葛绥成反动面目被揭露
    本报讯　地图出版社在反右派斗争中，已经揭露出妄想篡夺人民地图编绘出版事业领导权的右派分子章高炜和猖狂放火的葛绥成。现在正对这两个右派分子进行说理批判。
    章高炜是地图出版社的制图技术人员，民革成员。他认为共产党要整风是因为“处在匈牙利事件的前夕”，以后要“开放政权”，因此他要“以民主党派成员的身份，参加地图社的共同领导”，以逐步篡夺地图出版社的领导权。
    章高炜从党的领导到党的政策进行了全面攻击。他污蔑党对国家的领导是“一党专政”。他主张“民主党派要能真正独立存在，必须拿出符合它的阶级基础的政治主张来和党分庭抗礼”。他诬指共产党内“也是少数人领导，少数人决定一切”，“党根本不可信任”。他本来是一个被政府宽大的反动党团骨干分子，但是，他却恩将仇报，污蔑“肃反运动是三大主义的总和”。他威胁组织恢复他的所谓“名誉”，并鼓动过去“被整被斗的人”向党算账。
    葛绥成是地图出版社的编审，九三学社社员。党的整风一开始，他就煽动对工资不满意的人向党“算账”。他要党员总编辑下台“去学四、五年”。他还大骂积极分子在鸣放中“连屁都不放”，对积极分子施加压力，要他们向党进攻。
    据揭露，章高炜是由中统头子陈立夫和叶楚伧介绍加入国民党的，曾经取得特字号的党证。他还担任过国民党四川省党部直属北碚区党部候补委员、秘书等职务，曾亲手制作过江西“剿共”地图。在他参加地图出版社工作以后，仍一贯进行反党活动，散布反苏反共谬论。葛绥成曾当过英士大学训导长和国民党英士大学区党部书记，还是一个无恶不作的恶霸地主。
