　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 14th. Since the Vietnam Labor Party held the National Agricultural Labor Model Conference in May this year, the movement for mutual aid and cooperation in the northern Vietnamese countryside has been developing rapidly and steadily.

　　According to incomplete statistics, more than 70,000 work-exchange teams have been developed during this year's summer harvest and autumn plowing, including 15,000 year-round work-exchange teams. In the Vinh Linh area near the temporary demarcation line and the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region, 90% of farmers have participated in work-exchange teams. The development of the work-exchange and mutual aid movement in ethnic minority areas has not only guaranteed the increase in summer rice production but also strengthened the unity among various ethnic groups.

　　The vast majority of work-exchange teams in the Vietnamese countryside were developed during the land reform movement from the end of 1955 to the beginning of 1956. At that time, because the principle of voluntary participation was not fully implemented, most of them later disintegrated. Although the current number of work-exchange teams has not yet returned to its previous level, the mutual aid teams that have been organized have a relatively solid foundation.

　　The Vietnamese government plans to vigorously develop the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement during this year's autumn harvest and next year's spring plowing. At present, work-exchange cadre training courses are being held in various places to prepare cadres for next year's large-scale development.

　　At present, under the policy of "active leadership and steady progress," the government is vigorously developing mutual aid teams on the one hand, and also trying to gradually transform seasonal work-exchange teams into year-round work-exchange teams; and to transform work-exchange teams that have concentrated the use of land and jointly labor into production cooperatives.

### 越南北方农村欣欣向荣  合作互助运动健步前进

　　越南北方农村欣欣向荣
　　合作互助运动健步前进
    新华社河内14日电  在今年5月越南劳动党召开了全国农业劳动模范大会以后，越南北方农村的互助合作运动迅速和稳步地开展起来。
    据不完全统计，在今年夏收和秋耕期间发展起来的变工组已经有七万多个，其中包括一万五千个常年变工组。在临时分界线附近的永灵地区和泰苗自治区，90％的农户都参加了变工组。少数民族地区变工互助运动的发展，不仅保证了夏稻的增产，而且还加强了各民族之间的团结。
    越南农村的变工组绝大部分是在1955年底到1956年初土地改革运动中发展起来的，当时由于没有充分贯彻自觉自愿的原则，后来大半解体。目前变工组的数字虽还没有恢复到以前的水平，但是已经组织起来的互助组基础比较稳固。
    越南政府准备在今年秋收和明年春耕期间再大力发展农村互助合作运动。目前正在各地开办变工干部训练班，为明年的大发展准备干部。
    目前政府在“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针下，一面大力发展互助组，另外还设法逐步把季节性的变工组转变为常年变工组；把已经集中使用土地、共同劳动的变工组转变为生产合作社。
