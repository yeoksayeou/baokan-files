Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 5th: At the Sixth Session of the First People's Congress of Shanxi Province, the representatives continued to wage a struggle of reason against the rightist Wang Wenguang.

The rightist Wang Wenguang was the Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Democratic League in Shanxi Province, and a stronghold of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Taiyuan. It has been revealed that he followed Luo Longji as early as 1949, fighting against the leftists in the China Democratic League. During the period of great blooming and contending, he promoted that the China Democratic League should "sit on an equal footing" with the Communist Party and not be led by the Communist Party. He also spoke out for the unjust causes of counter-revolutionaries, wanting to "redress" counter-revolutionaries. Wang Wenguang frequently provoked the relationship between intellectuals and the Party, attacked the leftists in the League headed by Deng Chumin, slandered the Communist Party members in the League, and formed his own anti-communist forces. After the blooming and contending, his team responded to his attack on the Communist Party from all directions, becoming the largest rightist force in Shanxi Province to attack the Communist Party. Of the thirty-three branches of the China Democratic League in the province under the leadership of Wang Wenguang, twenty-three had rightists. Wang Wenguang personally placed "Four King Kongs" in four universities; the chairmen of the China Democratic League branches in Changzhi, Anyi, Pingyao, Linfen, Fenyang, Qixian and other places were all Wang Wenguang's "commissioners." He also planned behind the scenes to organize the "Tongren Bao" (Fellow Men Newspaper) and "Tongren Publishing House" (Fellow Men Publishing House), attempting to bring down the Shanxi Daily and the "Spark" magazine, among other crimes.

At the meeting, many representatives from the intellectual community criticized Wang Wenguang's fallacies such as "the integrity of intellectuals has been defeated in the past few years," "intellectuals should strive for knowledge," and the Communist Party should "visit the thatched cottage thrice" for intellectuals. The representatives pointed out that Wang Wenguang has been using these fallacies to win over intellectuals to participate in his organization for conspiracy activities. Representative Zou Guang refuted with his own experience: I couldn't even become an elementary school teacher in the old society. My life had no security. After liberation, I became a people's elementary school teacher, middle school teacher, and now I am honored to be a representative of the Provincial People's Congress and a member of the County People's Committee. Does this mean that the Party has defeated my integrity? The representatives said that the broad masses of intellectuals, especially those who have been influenced by bourgeois ideology in old China, have established the integrity of striving to the end for the realization of socialism and even communism only after years of ideological remolding.

Under the pursuit of the representatives, Wang Wenguang had to express his plea of guilt to the people.

    山西人民代表驳斥谬论
    王文光向人民请罪
    据新华社太原5日电　在山西省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上，代表们对右派分子王文光继续进行了说理斗争。
    右派分子王文光是民盟山西省筹备委员会副主任委员、章罗联盟设在太原的据点。据揭露，他早在1949年就跟随罗隆基，向民盟中的左派进行斗争。大鸣大放期间，他宣传民盟要和共产党“平起平坐”，不受共产党的领导。他还为反革命分子喊冤，要为反革命分子“平反”。王文光经常挑拨知识分子和党的关系，打击盟内以邓初民为首的左派，诽谤盟内的共产党员，组成自己的反共势力。鸣放以后，他的这支队伍四处响应他对共产党的进攻，成为山西省向共产党进攻的一支最大的右派势力。在王文光领导下的全省三十三个民盟支部中，就有二十三个支部有右派分子。王文光在四个高等学校亲自安插了“四大金刚”；长治、安邑、平遥、临汾、汾阳、祁县等地的民盟支部主任委员都是王文光的“专员”。他还在幕后策划阴谋组织“同人报”、“同人出版社”，企图搞垮山西日报、“火花”杂志社等罪行。
    会上，许多知识界的代表对王文光的“几年来知识分子的气节被打垮了”，“知识分子应为知识而奋斗”，共产党对知识分子应该 “三顾茅庐”等等谬论进行了批判。代表们指出，王文光这几年来一直是以这些谬论拉拢知识分子参加他的组织进行阴谋活动的。邹光代表用自己的经历反驳说：我在旧社会里连一个小学教员都当不上。生活没有着落，解放以后，我当了人民的小学教师、中学教师，现在又荣任省人民代表大会代表和县人民委员会委员，这难道说党是把我的气节打垮了吗？代表们说，广大知识分子特别是在旧中国受过资产阶级思想影响的人，正是经过几年来的思想改造，才树立了为实现社会主义以至共产主义而奋斗到底的气节。
    王文光在代表们的追击下，不得不表示向人民请罪。
