Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 19th.

    More than 400 performers in Shanghai's comic and popular drama circles gathered on the 17th to expose and criticize the anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks of comic actor Gong Yifei.
    Many famous comic actors peeled away the so-called "middle-of-the-road" artistic disguise of rightist Gong Yifei at the meeting, revealing his reactionary essence. Gong Yifei has consistently spread the fallacy that "comic opera cannot serve politics" and has single-mindedly pursued low-level, vulgar, and obscene content. In the "Ah Fei Exhibition," which he wrote, directed, and starred in himself, he portrayed swindling and bullying rogue Ah Feis as witty and brave "heroes," while doing everything possible to uglify the cadres and working people in the play. As early as in plays like "Da Bu Tong," he used the mouths of capitalists to denounce the Communist Party, saying "Communists share wives," and "Communists advocate equality between men and women; if they are not the same length, they must be leveled." He once openly refused to broadcast songs promoting the significance of the general election.
    The artists revealed that Gong Yifei's anti-communist and anti-socialist behavior was even more serious in his resistance to leadership and criticism. When party newspapers published articles criticizing him, he not only did not examine himself but proudly said: "The more the newspapers criticize me, the better my business will be." He also maliciously told people: "The criticism in the newspapers is a personal attack, and I will file a lawsuit against them."
    He resisted the implementation of many government measures. Gong Yifei slandered the Cultural Bureau's regulations on the rational allocation of theaters and the requirement that troupes perform in other places and factories for some time each year as "cruel abuse" of artists, and he gathered people everywhere to hold secret meetings to discuss countermeasures. When the government held meetings asking troupes not to divide up all the public savings funds so that they could be used to help artists in times of need during the off-season, Gong Yifei deliberately divided up all the public savings funds immediately after hearing this. When others advised him against it, he cursed and said: "You are flattering the government; I won't buy it." He wanted to raise ticket prices privately, but the government did not approve it, so he cursed loudly: "The People's Government is even worse than the reactionaries; the superiors kill people without knives." He also incited people in the troupe to petition the government.
    People revealed that Gong Yifei opposed the government and hated the Communist Party in this way because he was一心想使资本主义复辟，走回头路. Gong Yifei has always indulged in eating, drinking, gambling, and prostitution, living a decadent bourgeois life. For the sake of money, he did not hesitate to poison the people on and off the stage, often saying to people: "Money is real, progress is fake." When his corrupt life and personal fame and fortune were restricted, he was greatly dissatisfied and greatly slandered the people's democratic dictatorship and policies such as unified purchase and sales.
    Shanghai's comic and popular drama circles will continue to launch criticisms against the reactionary remarks of rightist Gong Yifei to distinguish between right and wrong.

### 上海滑稽、通俗话剧界清除败类  龚一飞反共言行被揭露

    上海滑稽、通俗话剧界清除败类
    龚一飞反共言行被揭露
    新华社上海19日电　上海滑稽、通俗话剧界四百多艺人，在17日集会揭露和批驳了滑稽戏演员龚一飞的反共反社会主义的言行。
    许多著名滑稽演员在会上剥开了右派分子龚一飞所谓艺术上走“中间路线”的外衣，揭穿了他的反动本质。龚一飞一贯散播“滑稽戏不能为政治服务”的谬论，一味追求低级、庸俗、下流。他自编、自导、自演的“阿飞展览会”，把欺榨撞骗的流氓阿飞渲染成机智勇敢的“英雄”，对戏中的干部和劳动人民则极尽丑化的能事。他很早就在“大不同”等剧中借资本家之口，大骂共产党“共产共妻”，说“共产党男女一律平等，如果不一样长短就要削平”。他曾公然拒绝播唱宣传普选意义的歌曲。
    艺人们揭露，龚一飞反共反社会主义更严重的表现在抗拒领导和批评。当党报刊载了批评他的文章时，他不但不检查自己，反而得意地说：“报上越批评，生意反而越好。”他又恶意地向人说：“报上的批评是人身攻击，我要对他们进行法律起诉。”
    他抗拒执行政府的许多措施。文化局关于合理调配剧场，剧团每年有一些时间到外地和下厂演出的规定，龚一飞污诬说是对艺人的“残酷虐待”，并且四处拉人召开秘密会议，商讨对策。政府开会要求剧团不要把公蓄金分光，以便到了淡季艺人生活可能发生困难时加以调剂。龚一飞听了回去，故意把公蓄金马上分光。别人劝他，他还谩骂说：“你们是拍政府马屁，我就不卖账。”他要私自抬高票价，政府不批准，他就破口大骂：“人民政府比反动派还恶劣，上级杀人不用刀。”还煽动剧团的人向政府请愿。
    人们揭露龚一飞这样反对政府，仇视共产党，是因为他一心想使资本主义复辟，走回头路。龚一飞一向吃喝嫖赌，过着糜烂的资产阶级生活。他为了钱，不惜在台上台下毒害人民，常对人说：“钱是真的，进步是假的”。当他腐化的生活和个人名利受到限制时，他就大为不满，对人民民主专政以及统购统销等政策大加污蔑。
    上海滑稽、通俗话剧界将针对右派分子龚一飞的反动言行，继续展开批判，辨明大是大非。
