Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 5th. The various construction units under the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, which had previously experienced slow project progress, have recently comprehensively exceeded the state total investment plan for August.

The North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau is responsible for the construction and installation of factory buildings for more than a dozen large factories in the Taiyuan area. However, a considerable number of leading cadres and workers in this engineering bureau did not fully understand the complexity and arduousness of the project, and neglected the coordination and connection between various types of work. As a result, although some local projects completed their workload, the overall bureau failed to complete its plan for the four, five, and six months, and the progress of most projects had to be postponed by one month or one quarter.

In mid-August, the engineering bureau criticized the departmentalism of some units. At the same time, the main leading cadres of the bureau went deep into work sections and groups to check the reasons for the slow progress of key national projects and urgently needed handover projects, and re-arranged the project progress. Corresponding improvements were also made in terms of manpower, material supply, and construction organization. As a result, in the second half of August, the bureau not only made up for the tasks not completed in the first half of the month, but also comprehensively exceeded the plan for the entire month.

Currently, the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau is making every effort to speed up construction during the current golden season for construction, to ensure the completion of the construction tasks stipulated by the state this year.

    扭转工程进度缓慢局面
    太原工程局超额完成八月份计划
    新华社太原5日电　原来工程进度缓慢的华北太原工程局所属各个施工单位最近全面超额完成了8月份国家总投资计划。
    华北太原工程局担负着太原地区十几个大型工厂的厂房建设和安装任务。但是，这个工程局有相当一部分领导干部和职工没有充分理解工程的复杂性、艰巨性，忽视了各个工种间的配合和衔接。结果，尽管局部工程完成了工作量，但是全局在四、五、六三个月中一直没有完成计划，大部工程的进度要推迟一个月或一个季度才能完成。
    8月中旬，这个工程局批评了某些单位的本位思想，同时，全局主要领导干部深入工段、小组，检查国家重点工程和国家急需移交工程项目进度缓慢的原因，重新排列了工程进度。在人力、物力供应和施工组织方面，也作了相应的改进，因此全局在8月下半月不仅补足了上半月没有完成的任务，而且全面超额完成了全月计划。
    现在，华北太原工程局正在利用当前施工的黄金季节加紧施工，保证完成今年国家规定的建设任务。
