Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 27th. The Syrian-Chinese Friendship Association held a reception here on the evening of the 26th to celebrate the establishment of the association.

    Syrian Defense Minister Azm praised the friendship between Syria and China at the reception. He said that both our countries face a common enemy, which is imperialism that attempts to destroy liberated countries. Our common goal is to safeguard sovereignty and independence.

    He said, "We are very pleased to receive China's support for our struggle."

    Azm said that Taiwan should be returned to its motherland and China should restore its seat in the United Nations.

    Azm said that the principle we follow in choosing friends is to maintain our freedom and friendship without any conditions or obligations, because we do not choose friends casually but based on tests and experience. He also said that when we engage with imperialist countries to seek friendship, "conditions and military treaties are usually imposed on us."

    Chinese Ambassador Chen Zhifang, in congratulating the establishment of the association, said: "The establishment of the association will help to further develop the friendly cause between the people of the two countries."

    Ambassador Chen traced the ancient traditional friendship between the two countries, especially the further development of this friendship after the Bandung Conference. He also said that it is foreseeable that the friendly relations between our two countries will have infinitely broad prospects and a brilliant future.

    He expressed, on behalf of the Chinese people and government, deep sympathy and full support for Syria's heroic struggle to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. He concluded by saying: "Your struggle is just. You are not isolated in your struggle."

    Association Secretary-General Salim Zirqili read out a congratulatory telegram from Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, which was met with warm applause in the hall. He also spoke at the meeting, explaining the purpose of the association and reviewing the development of friendship between the two countries and the two peoples.

    The famous national poet Abdul-Karim Karmi recited a poem he wrote praising the friendship between the two countries.

    More than 200 people attended the reception, including association leaders and members, government ministers, diplomatic envoys, people who had visited China, representatives of government departments and social organizations, and all members of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe.
