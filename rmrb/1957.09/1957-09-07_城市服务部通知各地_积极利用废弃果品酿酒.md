Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The City Service Department recently notified all regions to actively utilize substitutes and discarded fruits for winemaking.

The notice stated that the sales volume of wine this year is expected to increase by about 20% compared to last year. However, there is a shortage of raw materials for winemaking, and the existing production capacity is difficult to meet the consumption needs of the masses. Therefore, all regions must seize the current peak season for fruit sales, as well as the time when wild plants such as acorns, *sanzi*, and cassava are already ripe or about to ripen, and strive to purchase fallen fruits, substandard fruits, surplus fruits, and wild plants that can be used for winemaking, in order to make wine. If the City Service Department system itself does not have sufficient strength, it can purchase through supply and marketing cooperatives. In addition to fully utilizing existing equipment, winemaking factories in various regions, especially in key production areas, can build some small wineries and workshops if production capacity is insufficient, and organize agricultural cooperatives to use discarded fruits for winemaking.

In order to support this measure, the Ministry of Finance has decided to appropriately reduce the tax rate on wines made purely from substitutes and discarded fruits.

    城市服务部通知各地
    积极利用废弃果品酿酒
    据新华社6日讯 城市服务部最近通知各地积极地利用代用品和废弃果品来酿酒。
    通知说，今年酒的销售量预计将比去年上升20％左右，但是酿酒原料不足，现有产量难于满足群众消费需要。因此，各地要抓紧目前水果上市旺季，和野生植物如橡子、糁子、木薯等已经成熟或即将成熟的时节，努力收购落树果、残次果、剩余水果以及可以酿酒的野生植物，以便酿造成酒。城市服务部系统本身力量不够时，可以通过供销合作社收购。各地酿酒工厂除了充分利用现有设备以外，重点产区如果生产能力不足，可以建设一些小型酒厂和酒坊，并组织农业社利用废弃果品酿酒。
    财政部为了支持这一措施，对于纯粹用代用品和废弃果品酿的酒，已决定适当降低税率。
