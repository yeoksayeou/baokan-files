　　Take a Look at My Diary
　　In a secret letter from Zhong Dianfei to "Wenyi Bao" reporter Zhou Wenbo, he mentioned me: "It's almost possible to investigate the diary of an actress at Shanghai Film Studio (like Zhang Ying). What exactly has she been doing every day for the past few years? Presenting flowers, or being a fire safety team leader?"
　　When I saw Zhong Dianfei talking about me like this, I was very angry. I want to state that I have never been a fire safety team leader; but whether in the past, present, or future, as long as the leadership assigns me to be one or my comrades elect me, I am very willing to do it. Although I often present flowers, I believe this is a glorious task. But I never expected that right-wing elements would try to use this to attack the Party.
　　Now I will talk about my work situation in the past year, please see if it is as terrible as Zhong Dianfei described.
　　Last August, I performed the stage play "Looking West to Chang'an" at the Hangzhou Victory Theater, and from September, I performed in Shanghai, for a total of seventy-two performances. In November, I participated in the filming of "Deep Affection," and went to Nanjing to understand the life of workers and peasants, and filmed on location, which ended in April 1957. In May, I rehearsed the drama "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" in the troupe, and performed in June. During the day, I participated in the filming of the "Diary of a Nurse" film crew. In July, I joined the "Night Navigation in the Fog" film crew, and went to Dalian, Qingdao and other places to understand the life of sailors. On August 14th, I went to Qingdao to film location shots for "Sea Soul". At the end of August, I returned to Shanghai. The "Night Navigation in the Fog" crew will be filming interior scenes and outdoor scenes until November. In the past year, I have participated in two dramas and four films, working hard and living happily. The task of presenting flowers continues to be ongoing. This is my "diary," how should Zhong Dianfei explain this situation?
　　Of course, I have had moments of distress and even feelings of being wronged in my thoughts over the years, but I can still overcome them in time. Although I worked less in the previous years, I, as a specific individual, have gained valuable political and professional harvests through various movements and various studies within the factory. Zhong Dianfei wants to use me to attack the Party and sow discord between me and the Party, which is simply impossible!
　　As I was writing this letter, I received a letter from my mother in Beijing. She asked me why I did not express my attitude when Zhong Dianfei talked about me, and this letter moved me very much. An old woman who has never been involved in politics, whose life is limited to the family, also recognizes the viciousness of the right-wing elements, and also knows that her children should take the correct path. This example also shows that the right-wing elements can no longer deceive people.

### 看看我的日记吧

　　看看我的日记吧
    钟惦棐给“文艺报”记者周文博的密信中曾谈到过我：“简直可以调查上影一位演员的日记（如张莺），她这几年究竟每天在干些什么？献花，还是作消防小组长？”
    当我看到钟惦棐这样谈到我以后非常气愤。我要声明，我从未作过消防小组长；但是无论过去、现在和将来，只要领导上派我作或同志们选我作，我都很愿意作。献花虽常献，但我认为这是光荣的任务。但是想不到右派分子却想利用这一点来向党进攻。
  现在我谈谈我近一年来的工作情况，请看看是否像钟惦棐形容的那样可怕。
    去年8月份我在杭州胜利剧院演出舞台剧“西望长安”，9月份起在上海演出，前后共演七十二场。11月份我参加了“情长谊深”的摄制，就去南京了解工农生活，并拍摄外景，到1957年4月份结束。5月份在剧团排话剧“上海屋檐下”，6月份演出，白天参加了“女护士日记”摄制组的拍摄工作。7月份参加“雾海夜航”摄制组，在大连青岛等地了解海员生活。8月14日去青岛拍“海魂”外景。8月底回上海。现在“雾海夜航”组拍内景和场地外景工作要到11月份。这一年来我参加演出了两个话剧，四部电影，工作紧张，生活愉快。献花的任务还是不断的有。这就是我的“日记”，钟惦棐对于这种情况应该怎么解释呢？
    当然几年来我思想上有过苦闷甚至委屈情绪，但是自己还能及时克服。前几年工作虽较少，但在我这个具体的人身上，通过各次运动和厂内的各种学习，在政治上业务上的收获仍是宝贵的。钟惦棐想借我来攻击党，挑拨我和党的关系，根本办不到！
    当我正在写这封信的时候，接到我母亲从北京的来信。她问到我为什么钟惦棐谈到我我却不表示态度，这封信使我很感动。一位从来不过问政治的老太太，她的生活圈子仅仅局限在家庭里，但是她也认识到右派分子的恶毒，她也知道要自己的子女走正确的道路。这个例子也说明右派分子再也欺骗不了人了。　天马制片厂演员　张莺
