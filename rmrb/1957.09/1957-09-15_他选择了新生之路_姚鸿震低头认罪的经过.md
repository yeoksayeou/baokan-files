　　He Chose the Path of Rebirth
　　——The Process of Yao Hongzhen Lowering His Head and Admitting His Guilt
　　By Our Reporter  Li Gendi
    The anti-Rightist struggle is a serious political and ideological struggle. The only way out for Rightists is to bow their heads to the people, admit their guilt, abandon their reactionary stance, and take the socialist path.
    The process by which Yao Hongzhen, a ninth-grade engineer in the Ministry of Aquatic Products and a Rightist, turned to the side of the people after many ideological struggles, specifically illustrates the necessity and arduousness of the anti-Rightist struggle.
    Yao Hongzhen was a young technical personnel, born into a landlord and capitalist family. After graduating from university, he came to work in the aquatic products department. Over the years, his strong bourgeois ideology had been dominating him, and he expressed dissatisfaction with the Party and the new society in every way. In the early stage of the blooming and contending, he released twelve poisonous arrows at the Party. He agreed with Ge Peiqi's view that "without the leadership of the Communist Party, no one would sell the country"; he said: "The ignorant cannot lead the knowledgeable." In addition, there were many absurd remarks.
    When the anti-Rightist struggle began, someone posted a big-character poster criticizing Yao Hongzhen, but many people did not understand his situation, and there were few responses. In addition, he cleverly talked about some specious truths in his speech, which also blinded some people. People's exposure and criticism of him was not forceful enough. Under these circumstances, he proudly fantasized: "Look, they want to include me as a Rightist, but everyone will not support it." He also took the initiative to post a challenging big-character poster, demanding a public debate.
    Poisonous weeds will eventually be identified. In the process of in-depth study and discussion, Yao's face was gradually exposed. The first debate lasted for three days, and thirty-four speakers reasoned with him from all aspects. His absurd argument that "the ignorant cannot lead the knowledgeable" was refuted to the point where he was speechless. Everyone asked what is knowledge? Where does knowledge come from? Are Communist Party and worker-peasant cadres really ignorant? How much role can intellectuals play for the people without the leadership of the Party? Everyone asked how much knowledge Yao Hongzhen actually had, and even if he had some one-sided book knowledge, wasn't this knowledge a summary of the laboring people's struggle experience? ...
    Yao Hongzhen was refuted to the point of being speechless in the face of practical and forceful reasoning. In particular, he thought that an "ignorant" worker-peasant cadre spoke logically and hit his sore spot when refuting him, and he secretly admitted defeat in his heart. However, due to his class nature, he was unwilling to confess his guilt frankly, and he hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back. At the same time, he was also afraid that the more he spoke, the uglier he would become, and he would add to his crimes.
    The first round had achieved initial victory, but it had not yet won complete victory. During the three or four days of truce, Yao Hongzhen was mentally disturbed, and he was entangled by various thoughts. He wanted to hide it in his heart and correct it slowly, but then he thought, no, if I don't confess, I'm afraid I won't be able to pass the test. Suddenly, the newspaper published the decision on re-education through labor. He thought, is this my way out? He also thought, no, if I am expelled, I will return to my hometown to raise fish... No matter how he thought about it, it was not right, and he fell into deep contradiction.
    The leading cadres of the organization kindly talked to him, pointed out the future, asked him to confess, bow his head and admit his guilt, and explained the Party's policies to him, welcoming him to start anew, abandon evil and return to righteousness. Listening to these sincere and well-intentioned exhortations, Yao Hongzhen strengthened his confidence in confessing clearly and reforming himself. He thought, many responsible cadres in the organization are carrying bedding to sleep in the office, working day and night, aren't they doing this to defend socialism, to pull every dirty person who can be saved out of the mud? And why am I stubbornly holding on to wrong ideas, and drilling into a dead end? In this way, in group meetings and individual talks, he preliminarily confessed many of his erroneous thoughts: such as he once dreamed of raising funds to run capitalist enterprises, he wanted to be promoted and make a fortune, he felt sorry for the failure of the Kuomintang, he was not convinced by the leadership of the Communist Party, he thought the American two-party system was good, thinking it could promote party competition, he hoped to expand the strength of the democratic parties, he did not admit that the Party's policy principles mentioned by the central government were consistently correct...
    At the mass meeting, when Yao Hongzhen was asked to make further confessions, Yao Hongzhen hesitated again. He only confessed a few dry lines, without making in-depth excavations. Of course, the masses were not satisfied with this kind of confession. Everyone launched another round of severe criticism. And put forward specific clues for confession, giving him a chance to reconsider.
    For some time afterwards, everyone never relaxed the struggle against his erroneous thoughts. When he made some progress, he was given some encouragement, but also given necessary criticism. In this way, both criticism and encouragement; both progress and retreat, persistently fighting with him. In the process of talking with him by the responsible comrades, it was found that he loved face and was afraid of making himself even more stinky, so he dared not confess thoroughly, and he thought he could correct it secretly. According to this kind of thinking, it was pointed out to him that this kind of thinking only shows that he still wants to love his ugly bourgeois "face", and is unwilling to part with ugly things, this is a dead end; daring to boldly and thoroughly expose himself in front of the people shows that he is indeed determined to break with bourgeois ideology, accept the supervision of the masses, and be determined to correct it, this is to maintain his true face. It is also a touchstone to determine whether he will finally stand on the side of the people.
    Yao Hongzhen's mood was very contradictory during this period. Sometimes he was excited, as if he had jumped into the realm of light; sometimes he shrank back, entangled by old thoughts. Finally, with everyone's help, he was determined to break with his old thoughts. At the eleventh mass meeting, like a person awakened from a dream, he vomited out all his ugly thoughts, and expressed his intention to start anew and honestly return to the embrace of the people. Everyone also introduced him to relevant theoretical documents and learning materials to help him improve his thinking. He expressed that he would further thoroughly criticize his ugly thoughts with everyone's help.
    When he heard that the reporter was looking for him, he was stunned for a moment: "I haven't told my mother about this yet? If it's published in the newspaper, how sad she will be." Then he said, "Forget it, what my mother sees is her son's ugly past; but she will be happy for her son's rebirth!"

　　他选择了新生之路
　　——姚鸿震低头认罪的经过
　　本报记者  李根蒂
    反右派斗争是一场严重的政治上、思想上的斗争，右派分子一定要向人民低头认罪，放弃他们的反动立场，走社会主义之路，才是唯一的生路。
    水产部九级工程师、右派分子姚鸿震经过了多次的思想斗争，转向到人民方面来的过程，具体说明了反右派斗争的必要性和艰巨性。
    姚鸿震是一个青年技术人员，出身于地主兼资本家家庭，大学毕业就来到水产部门工作。几年来他的浓厚的资产阶级思想，一直支配着他，对党对新社会处处表示不满。鸣放初期，他前后放出十二支毒箭向党进攻。他同意葛佩琦的观点，认为“没有共产党领导，谁也不会卖国”；他说：“无知不能领导有知”。另外，还有不少荒谬的言论。
    反右派斗争开始，有人贴出批判姚鸿震的大字报，但人们多不了解他的情况，很少有反映。另外，在他发言中巧妙地谈了些似是而非的道理，也蒙蔽了一部分人，人们对他的揭露和批判是不够有力的。在这种情况下，他得意的狂想：“瞧，想把我列入右派，大家不会支持”，他还主动贴了一张挑战的大字报，要求开大会辩论。
    毒草终于是会被识别出来的，在大家深入学习讨论过程中，姚的面目逐渐暴露出来了。第一次辩论进行了三天，三十四个发言者从各方面同他说理。针对他“无知不能领导有知”的谬论，驳得他无言以对。大家问什么叫知识？知识是那里来的。共产党和工农干部是否真是无知？知识分子离开党的领导究竟对人民能发挥多大作用？大家问姚鸿震究竟有多少知识，就算有些片面的书本知识，这些知识还不是劳动人民斗争经验的总结？……
    姚鸿震在切实有力的说理斗争中被驳得理屈词穷。特别是他认为一个“无知”的工农出身的干部，在反驳他时说得头头是道，击中他的病根，他内心暗暗地服输了。可是，由于阶级本性使他不肯坦白认罪，吞吞吐吐，欲讲又收。同时他也怕越讲越丑恶，罪上加罪。
    第一回合已经取得了初步胜利，但还未获全胜。休战的三、四天内，姚鸿震精神恍惚，他被各种思想纠缠着。他想藏在心中慢慢改正，又一想，不行，不交代恐怕过不了关。突然，报上登出了关于劳动教养的决定。他想，难道这就是我的出路吗？他又想，不能，被开除的话，我就回到家乡养鱼，……怎么想也不对，他陷入了深深的矛盾中。
    机关领导干部关怀地找他谈心，指明前途，要他交代，低头认罪，并向他交代党的政策，欢迎他从新作人，改邪归正。姚鸿震听着这些诚恳、善意的劝告，他又坚定了交代清楚改造自己的信心。他想，机关很多负责干部，挟着铺盖到办公室睡觉，黑不当黑，明不当明，他们还不是为了保卫社会主义，为了把每一个可以救活的肮脏人拉出泥坑？而我到底为着什么牢牢抱住错误思想，尽往死胡同钻呢？这样在小组会和个别谈话中，他初步交代了他的许多错误思想：如他曾梦想要筹集资金兴办资本主义企业，他想升官发财，他对国民党的失败感到惋惜，他对共产党的领导不服气，认为美国两党制好，以为可以促进政党竞赛，他希望扩大民主党派的力量，他不承认中央说的党的政策原则一贯正确……。
    群众会上，要姚鸿震作进一步交代时，姚鸿震又犹豫了，他只交代了干巴巴的几条，不作深入的挖掘。群众当然不会满意他这种交代，大家又是一顿严厉的批判。并提出交代的具体线索，给他机会，让他再加考虑。
    以后一段时间，大家对他的错误思想一直没有放松斗争。当他略微有些进步，就给他一定的鼓励，同时也给以必要的批判。这样，又批判、又鼓励；又有进、又有退，坚持不懈地和他斗争。在负责同志和他谈话过程中，发现他爱面子，怕把自己搞得更臭，因而不敢彻底交代，他以为自己可以暗中加以改正。根据他这种思想，又给他指出，这样想法只不过是表明自己仍然要爱自己丑恶的资产阶级的“面子”，不肯和丑恶的东西分手，这是绝路；敢于在人民面前大胆彻底的暴露，表明自己确实有决心与资产阶级思想一刀两断，接受群众的监督，立志改正，这才是维护自己真正的面子。也是决定自己是否最后站到人民立场上来的试金石。
    姚鸿震这一时期心情是十分矛盾的。一时兴奋，好像跳进了光明的境界；一时间又退缩，为旧思想所纠缠。最后他终于在大家的帮助下，决心与自己的旧思想绝交。在第十一次群众会上，他像大梦初醒的人一样，吐出了自己一切的丑恶思想，并且表示从新做人，要老老实实回到人民的怀抱里。大家又给他介绍了有关的理论文件和学习材料，帮助他提高思想，他表示要在大家帮助下更进一步彻底把自己的丑恶思想批判干净。
    当他听说记者找他时，他怔了一下：“这件事情我还没有告诉妈妈呢？报上一登，她该多么难过”。接着又说“算了吧，妈妈看到的，是儿子丑陋的过去；可是她会为儿子的新生而高兴！”
