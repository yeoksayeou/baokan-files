Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 21st: The Soviet State Hydro-Planning Institute is formulating a comprehensive plan for the integrated utilization of the water resources of the Yenisei and Angara Rivers in Siberia. According to preliminary designs, in addition to the three hydropower stations currently under construction on these two major rivers, another nine huge hydropower stations will be built successively.

The Yenisei River is one of the richest rivers in the world in terms of hydropower resources. Its annual inflow of water into the Kara Sea is approximately 550 billion cubic meters, which is more than twice the annual inflow of Europe's largest river, the Volga. In order to utilize its hydropower resources, Soviet scientists have decided to build a total of six large hydropower stations on this major river. In addition to the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station currently under construction, the Sayansk and Minusinsk hydropower stations will be built upstream; the Yenisei Hydropower Station will be built at the confluence of the Yenisei and Angara Rivers; and the Osinovo and Lower Yenisei hydropower stations will be built downstream. The power generation capacity of these hydropower stations is very large. The Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station, which is currently under construction, has a power generation capacity of four million kilowatts, making it the largest hydropower station currently under construction in the world. Its economic and technical indicators will rank first in the Soviet Union. The future Yenisei Hydropower Station will be much larger than the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station, with a power generation capacity of five million kilowatts and an annual production of 35 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is more than seventeen times the total electricity production in Russia in 1913.

    充分利用叶尼塞河和安加拉河水力
    苏联将再兴建九个大水电站
    未来的叶尼塞水电站比克拉斯诺雅尔斯克还要大
    据新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联国家水利设计研究所正在为综合利用西伯利亚的叶尼塞河和安加拉河的水力富源制订全面规划。根据初步的设计，在这两条大河上除现在正在建设的三个水电站以外，还将陆续建设其他九个巨大的水电站。
    叶尼塞河是世界上水力资源最丰富的河流之一，它每年流入喀拉海的水量约达五千五百亿立方公尺，等于欧洲最大的伏尔加河每年入海水量的两倍以上。为了利用它的水力资源，苏联科学家已经决定在这条大河上总共建设六个大水电站。除正在修建的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站以外，还将在上游建立萨扬斯克和密奴新斯克两个水电站；在叶尼塞河和安加拉河合流处将建立叶尼塞水电站；在下游将建立奥锡诺沃和下叶尼塞两个水电站。这些水电站的发电能力都非常大。正在建设的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的发电能力有四百万瓩，是目前正在建设的世界上最大的水电站。它的经济技术指标将居苏联第一位。未来的叶尼塞水电站比克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站还要大得多，发电能力将达五百万瓩，每年将生产三百五十亿度电力，这比1913年俄国的电力总产量还多十七倍以上。
