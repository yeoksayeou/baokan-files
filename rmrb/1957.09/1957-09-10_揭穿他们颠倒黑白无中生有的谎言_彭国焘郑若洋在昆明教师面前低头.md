    Exposing Their Lies of Distorting Facts and Fabricating Stories
    Peng Guotao and Zheng Ruoyang Bow Their Heads Before Kunming Teachers
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Yunnan Daily, over the past few days, more than 2,300 faculty and staff members from 33 middle schools in Kunming have gathered to expose and criticize the anti-socialist activities of rightists Peng Guotao (Principal of Kunming No. 1 Normal School, Alternate Member of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League) and Zheng Ruoyang (Teacher at Kunming No. 1 Normal School, Chairman of the Kunming No. 1 Normal School Branch of the China Democratic League).
    The numerous "trumped-up" charges that Peng Guotao and Zheng Ruoyang fabricated against Party organizations and Party members when they launched a frenzied attack on the Party have been completely discredited by the facts presented at the conference. They had said, "Developing Party members is taking the youth route," "Party membership is money, fame, and status," "Only Party members have the opportunity for further study," and so on. Teacher Cheng Baoqi refuted these claims with the actual situation in the school: among the Party members developed by the school last year, five were over 30 years old, and one was over 40. Were they also youths? Among the leading comrades in Kunming No. 1 Normal School, are there not four non-Party leading comrades alongside the three Party members? In the two selections of graduate students, not one was a Party member; on the contrary, members of the China Democratic League occupied several places. As for treatment, Peng Guotao's salary was the highest in the school, more than 120 yuan per month, and Zheng Ruoyang's was also more than 80 yuan, while the Party branch secretary of the school only received 62 yuan per month after a promotion. There were also many workers who remained diligent in their original jobs after joining the Party. Peng Guotao and his ilk were still not satisfied, and it was they who created a stir over fame and status in the school, engaging in sectarian activities. Another teacher also refuted their lies about "having positions without power, unable to intervene in major school affairs" with facts. He questioned: which major decision in the school was made without you two? Which important meeting did you not attend? Even when the Party branch committee held meetings, you were invited to attend as observers. Was that not enough? Originally, that was not what they wanted; they wanted to fundamentally abolish the leadership of the Party. It was they who acted arbitrarily, ruling like overlords. At a symposium convened by the United Front Department of the Municipal Committee, Peng Guotao slapped the table and said: "This time when I go back, I will remove several from their positions and reduce their salaries." Sure enough, after he returned, he privately transferred several teachers out, without even informing the educational leadership departments, and arbitrarily disbanded the school's work improvement group.
    At the meeting, several teachers who had been drawn in by Peng Guotao and Zheng Ruoyang, after struggling to raise their awareness, also further exposed many new facts about their planned and prepared attack on the Party and socialism on the spot. During the period of the Great Blooming and Free Contending, Peng and Zheng, while disseminating a series of reactionary remarks, secretly planned to have each branch committee of the China Democratic League grab several members, stipulating that each member should "contact" several members of the masses, asking them to light fires everywhere and collect materials for attacking the Party. They also said: "With the enemy at hand, we must increase the organizational life of the League, changing it from once a week to twice." At these meetings, Peng and Zheng asked their members to report on the content and situation of "blooming and contending," and then disseminated the plans they had discussed. One League member told Peng Guotao that there was nothing left to "bloom," but Peng replied: "Anything you hear can be 'bloomed'," and instructed the teacher to "liaison" with others. In those days, Peng Guotao was so mad that he "forgot himself." Once, he returned from a meeting at the United Front Department of the Municipal Committee, feeling unwell, and immediately found the school doctor, saying: "Quick, give me an injection, I still have to go to the military district to 'bloom' this afternoon." Seeing League members who were not working hard enough for them, they said: "Blooming and contending is a test of a League member's level of awareness," and encouraged them, saying: "With the organization behind you, don't be afraid. We all have united front relations, we are not afraid." They also prepared a "personnel adjustment plan" and a "salary adjustment plan," preparing to seize the opportunity to remove the Party member heads of teaching and internship, replacing them with League members, and to reduce the salaries of a group of Party member cadres.
    Peng Guotao and Zheng Ruoyang, these two rightists who once united to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, had no choice but to bow their heads in the face of the facts exposed by the masses.

### 揭穿他们颠倒黑白无中生有的谎言  彭国焘郑若洋在昆明教师面前低头

    揭穿他们颠倒黑白无中生有的谎言
    彭国焘郑若洋在昆明教师面前低头
    本报讯　据云南日报消息：昆明市三十三个中等学校教职员二千三百余人连日集会，对昆明第一师范学校右派分子彭国焘（该校校长、民盟云南省委候补委员）、郑若洋（该校教员、民盟昆明第一师范支部主任委员）的反社会主义活动进行揭露和批判。
    彭国焘、郑若洋在向党发起猖狂进攻时给党组织和党员捏造的许多“莫须有”的罪名，在大会上大家所列举的事实驳斥之下，已经彻底破产。他们曾说，“发展党员是走青年路线”，“党员就是金钱、名誉、地位”，“只有党员才有进修学习的机会”等等。程葆琪老师以学校内的实际情况驳斥说：学校去年所发展的党员中，就有五个是三十岁以上的人，有一个是四十岁以上，难道也是青年吗？我们昆一师有三个党员领导同志，不是同时也有四个非党的领导同志吗？在两次选拔研究生当中，没有一个是党员，相反的，民盟盟员倒占了好几名。再说待遇，彭国焘是全校工资最高的一个，每月要拿一百二十多元，郑若洋也是八十多元，而学校的中共总支书记，晋了级后每月也只有六十二元，还有好些工友同志，他们入了党后，仍然勤勤恳恳做着原来的工作。而彭国焘他们还嫌不足，在学校里闹名誉地位，搞宗派活动的正是他们自己。另一老师也以事实驳斥了他们的所谓“有职无权，不能过问学校大事”的谎言。他质问说：学校那一次重大事项的决定少得了你们两个？那一次重要会议没有你们参加？甚至党的总支委员会开会时，也把你们请去列席，这还不行吗？原来他们要的并不是这些，他们要根本取消党的领导。独断独行，称王称霸的也正是他们自己。彭国焘在市委统战部召开的座谈会上拍拍桌子说：“这回回去撤掉几个职，降他几个薪。”果然，他回来后就私自把几个老师调了出去，连教育领导部门都不知道，还自作主张地把学校里改进工作小组解散掉。
    在会上，有好几个曾经被彭国焘、郑若洋拉拢的老师，经过斗争提高觉悟后，也当场进一步揭露了他们有准备、有计划地向党向社会主义进攻的许多新的事实。大鸣大放期间，彭、郑在散布了一连串的反动言论的同时，曾经秘密策划，要每个民盟支部的支委抓几个盟员，规定每个盟员“联系”几个群众，要他们四处点火，搜集向党进攻的材料。还说：“大敌当前，我们要把盟的组织生活加起班来，由每星期一次改成两次。”在这些会议上，彭、郑叫他们的成员汇报“鸣放”的内容和情况，又把他们商量的计划布置下去。有一个盟员对彭国焘表示：已经没有放的了，彭即答复：“听来的都可以放”，又布置这位老师下去“串连”。在那些日子，彭国焘疯狂到“忘我”的地步。有一次，他从市委统战部开会回来，身体不好，马上找到校医说：“快给我打一针，下午我还要到军区去放。”看到不太为他们卖力的盟员，他们就说：“鸣放是考验一个盟员的觉悟高低”，并打气说：“有组织撑腰，不要怕，我们都是有统战关系的人，不怕。”他们还准备了什么“人事调整方案”和“工资调整方案”准备伺机抛出，企图把党员教导主任、实习主任都撤除，换盟员来担任，并要降一批党员干部的工资。
    彭国焘、郑若洋这两个曾经联合起来向党猖狂进攻的右派分子，在群众揭发的事实面前，不得不低下头来。
