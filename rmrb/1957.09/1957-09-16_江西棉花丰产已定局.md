    (Report from our newspaper) Jiangxi Province's one million and three thousand mu of upland cotton has begun picking. Approximately 70,000 mu have an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Judging from the yield of the first picking, the total cotton output of the province may reach more than 465,000 dan (ginned cotton), an increase of more than 24% compared with last year. The average yield per mu can reach 45 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 11.8% compared with last year's average yield of 38 jin per mu, and 12.8% higher than the national average cotton output of 35 jin last year. At present, a bumper cotton harvest in the province is a foregone conclusion.
