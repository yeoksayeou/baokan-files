Such a "Free World"

    The Business Acumen of American Lawyers
    American lawyers charge exorbitant fees, bordering on extortion. For example, in the town of Dowlers, a "famous lawyer" named Ender Meyer was casually asked a legal question about a house mortgage at a social gathering. Three days later, the person received a bill from Ender Meyer demanding a consultation fee of three hundred US dollars. Helpless, the person had to pay.
    Money Can Buy the Title of Painter
    Recently, eye-catching large-character advertisements have frequently appeared in Parisian newspapers, listing the names of some hitherto unknown painters. These so-called painters are actually a group of incompetent people who have bought the title of painter with money. Many newspapers, in order to make money, indiscriminately praise certain crude and shoddy products as "artistic masterpieces." Some newspapers can even publish reproductions of certain painters' works in the most prominent places in the newspaper. The size of the reproduction is determined by the amount of money paid. As a result, some inexperienced French people are confused about what is good art and what is bad art.

　　如此“自由世界”
    美国律师的生意经
    美国律师收费奇昂，迹近勒索。例如，道勒斯城的“名律师”安得麦尔在某社交场合中，有人偶而询以房屋抵押的法律问题，三日之后，这人即收到安得麦尔的账单，索取咨询费三百美金。此人无奈，只得照付。
    钱可买到画家的称号
    近来在巴黎报刊上经常出现惹人注意的大字广告。登着一些迄今未出名的画家的名字。这些所谓画家实际上是一批不学无术之徒，但他们拿钱买到了画家的称号。许多报刊为了赚钱，胡乱称赞某些粗制滥造的劣品为“艺术杰作”。有些报刊还可以在报上最显著的地方刊登某些画家作品的翻版。翻版的大小由付钱的多少来决定。因此使得一些没有经验的法国人，弄不清什么是好画，坏画。
