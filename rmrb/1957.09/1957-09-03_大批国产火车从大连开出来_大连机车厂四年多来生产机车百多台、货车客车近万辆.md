Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 2nd: In the first eight months of this year, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory manufactured another 62 steam locomotives and more than 1,300 freight cars. To date, since the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, the factory has manufactured more than 180 steam locomotives, more than 9,200 freight cars, and more than 700 passenger cars.

Before liberation, the locomotives running on China's railways were all imported from abroad. This factory only began to manufacture the MK1 type locomotive itself in 1954 by imitating old designs. This type of locomotive can pull a train weighing more than 2,300 metric tons on slopes. Later, it trial-produced two or three Heping (Peace) type locomotives and Jianshe (Construction) type locomotives, which were the first two new types of steam locomotives designed and manufactured by our country itself. Under the same conditions, the Heping type locomotive can pull 80% more train weight than the MK1 type locomotive, and save 12% of coal per 10,000-ton kilometers. Currently, the Heping type locomotives that have been produced are participating in trial operations on the Jinan and Xuzhou railway lines. The Jianshe type locomotive is designed by modifying the drawings of the MK1 type locomotive. It can pull about 22% more goods than the MK1 type locomotive, and replaces heavy manual labor such as coal loading with automatic machines. At present, the factory has stopped producing the relatively old-fashioned MK1 type locomotive and started mass-producing the Jianshe type locomotive; by the end of this year, the factory will produce 33 Jianshe type locomotives.

The factory's newly manufactured six or seven types of new freight cars, such as boxcars, flatcars, tank cars, and ingot cars, are also transporting grain and other goods on railway lines across the country. Specially made light oil tank cars and concentrated sulfuric acid tank cars for loading gasoline, kerosene, and concentrated sulfuric acid were successfully trial-produced and started to be manufactured in 1954.

    大批国产火车从大连开出来
    大连机车厂四年多来生产机车百多台、货车客车近万辆
    新华社旅大2日电  今年前八个月，大连机车车辆厂又制造出六十二台蒸汽机车、一千三百多辆货车。至此，这个工厂从执行第一个五年计划以来，已经制造出蒸汽机车一百八十多台，货车九千二百多辆，客车七百多辆。
    解放前，奔驶在中国铁路线上的机车都是从国外进口的。这个工厂直到1954年才开始仿照旧设计自己制造冖ㄎ1型机车。这种机车，在坡道上能拉着两千三百多公吨重的列车行驶。以后，又试造出两、三台和平型机车和建设型机车，这是我国最早自己设计和自己制造的两种新型蒸汽机车。和平型机车在同样条件下行驶，能比冖ㄎ1型机车牵引列车重量多80％，每万吨公里可以省煤12％。现在，已出厂的和平型机车正在济南、徐州两地铁路上参加试运。建设型机车是冖ㄎ1型机车的图纸经过改造而设计的，它比冖ㄎ1型机车可以多拉货物约22％，并且把笨重的加煤等手工劳动改用自动机器来代替。目前，工厂已经停止生产比较旧式的冖ㄎ1型机车，开始大批生产建设型机车；到年底以前，这个厂将生产建设型机车三十三台。
    这个厂新造的棚车、平车、罐车、元宝车等六、七种新型货车，也已经在各地铁路线上运送粮食等货物。装载汽油、煤油和浓硫酸的特制轻油罐车和浓硫酸罐车，在1954年就试制成功开始制造。
