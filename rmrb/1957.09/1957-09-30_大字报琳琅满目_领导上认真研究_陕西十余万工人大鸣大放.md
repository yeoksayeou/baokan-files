Shaanxi, September 29 (From Our Newspaper) - In the Shaanxi area, more than 100,000 workers in over eighty factories and mines have launched a vigorous upsurge of *da ming da fang* (speaking out freely). Walking into these factories, one can see a delightful atmosphere of red and green decorations everywhere, with *dazibao* (big character posters) posted all around. On the third day of the *da ming da fang* campaign at the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mills No. 3, 4, and 5, more than 6,000 *dazibao* were posted, putting forward more than 10,000 suggestions. At the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, the sixty-plus ghostwriters in the twelve *dazibao* writing offices were extremely busy all day long.

According to incomplete statistics, workers have now put forward more than 100,000 suggestions to the leadership, most of which revolve around the central issue of running collective enterprises and socialist enterprises well. At the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory, many workers posted *dazibao* criticizing the rapid promotion of apprentice workers. For example, worker Li Zhongxin is an old maintenance worker with over ten years of experience, earning a monthly salary of fifty or sixty yuan, while his son, who has only been in the factory for six months, earns the same monthly salary as his father.

Leading personnel of various factories and mines warmly welcome the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the workers. They set aside time every day to carefully read the *dazibao* and designate special personnel to copy each *dazibao*, classify them, and process them. Many units have established problem-solving groups personally led by Party and government cadres, studying the opinions put forward by employees item by item every night, resolving those that can be resolved immediately, and responding to the masses with *dazibao*. For example, the Baoji Railway Stationmaster did not delve deeply into his work in the past. Recently, he accepted the criticisms and suggestions of the masses and now goes deep into passenger and freight cars and loading and unloading workshops for inspection every morning and at midnight. Workers said, "The leaders don't mind the hard work, we should work harder in production and help the leaders improve their work." Employees of the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory suggested that the leading personnel do not work at night, and their dormitories are far from the office, so problems cannot be solved in time. The factory leaders accepted the opinions of the masses and established a system of rotating night shifts for the factory director, Party committee secretary, and other main leaders.

Many units have also made arrangements for production while mobilizing workers to speak out freely. For example, the Xin’tai Textile Factory established two leading groups for rectification and production, ensuring that both production and rectification are not neglected. Since September, the factory's output and quality of cotton cloth have exceeded the plan, the attendance rate has increased compared to the past, and accidents have decreased.

    大字报琳琅满目　领导上认真研究
    陕西十余万工人大鸣大放
    本报西安29日电　陕西地区已有八十多个厂矿企业的十余万工人，掀起了大鸣大放的热潮。走到这些工厂里，都可以看到全厂披红带绿、到处贴满大字报的可喜气氛。西北国棉三、四、五厂开始鸣放的第三天，就贴出六千多张大字报，提出一万多条意见。国棉四厂十二个大字报代书处的六十多个代笔人整天忙得不可开交。
    据不完全统计，现在工人们已经给领导上提出了十多万条意见，其中绝大部分都是围绕着办好集体事业和社会主义企业这一中心问题提出来的。新西北印染厂不少工人贴出大字报，对学徒工人升级太快提出批评。如该厂工人李忠信是十几年的老保全工人，每月收入工资五、六十元，而他的儿子是进厂才六个多月的工人，每月工资收入就和他父亲一样。
    各工矿企业的领导人员都热忱地欢迎工人提出的批评和意见，他们每天都抽出时间来认真的阅读大字报，并指定专人把每一张大字报都抄录下来，分类排队，进行处理。很多单位都成立了由党政负责干部亲自领导的处理问题小组，每天晚上对职工提出的意见逐条进行研究，对能够解决的马上解决，并用大字报答复群众。如宝鸡车站站长过去工作不深入，最近他接受了群众的批评意见，每天早晨和晚上十二点钟还深入客、货车和装卸车间进行检查。工人反映，领导不嫌辛苦，我们更应该好好生产和帮助领导改进工作。新西北印染厂职工提出领导人员晚上都不上班，宿舍离办公室又很远，发生问题不能及时解决的意见。该厂领导人员接受群众的意见，建立了厂长、党委书记等主要领导人员晚上轮流值班制度。
    很多单位在发动工人鸣放的同时，还对生产进行了安排。如新泰纺织厂成立了整风和生产两个领导小组，做到了生产和整风两不误。该厂9月份以来棉布产量、质量都超额完成了计划，出勤率比过去提高了，事故也减少了。
