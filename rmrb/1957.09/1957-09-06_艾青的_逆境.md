Ai Qing's "Adversity"
    Jin Zhen
    Intellectuals in the old society all thought highly of themselves. "All other professions are base, only studying is noble" was their self-description. Now it's a new society, but some intellectuals who haven't undergone ideological remolding not only remember those two sentences firmly but have also developed them a step further. They believe that writers, especially those with international reputations, are a cut above other intellectuals, even above the Party. The "writer" Ding Ling sees it this way, and the "poet" Ai Qing sees it this way too.
    Ai Qing once said to the rightist Wu Zuguang: "Even if I make mistakes, the Party can't do anything to me. I have international status, and the Party has to consider the impact." Look how complacent he is, what does he take our Party for! Because he "has international status," he can be a special person, make mistakes as he pleases, and act lawlessly!
    Of course, the Party and the people don't see the problem the way he does. It's precisely because the Party considers his "international status" and "influence" that it spares no effort to help him, repeatedly criticizing him to pull him out of the extremely vile pit of individualism, to make him a poet in the true sense of the word, and to prevent him from having a bad international influence. But Ai Qing slanders the Party's criticism and help as "the Party is ruthless and only rectifies people," saying that he is "living in adversity."
    Today's new society is indeed an "adversity" for an individualist like Ai Qing who is contemptuous of everyone. If he doesn't put down his stinking airs, thoroughly repent, and undergo thorough ideological remolding, this "adversity" will continue to be "adverse" until his own destruction.

    艾青的“逆境”
    金真
    旧社会的知识分子都是自以为了不起的。“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”，就是他们的自况。现在是新社会了，可是有些没有经过思想改造的知识分子，不仅还死死地记住上面那两句话，而且还把它发展了一步。他们认为作家，尤其是有国际声望的作家，在读书人中又要高上一等，甚至于高高在党之上。“作家”丁玲这样看，“诗人”艾青也这样看。
    艾青曾对右派分子吴祖光说：“我犯了错误，党也不能怎样我，我在国际上有地位，党也得考虑影响”。你看他想得多惬意，把我们党看成了个什么样子！因为“在国际上有地位”，他就可以做一个特殊的人，就可以随便犯错误，就可以无法无天！
    党和人民当然不是像他那样看问题的。党正是考虑到他“在国际上有地位”，有“影响”，才不遗余力地帮助他，一再地批评他，要把他从那极端卑鄙的个人主义的泥坑里拉出来，使他成为名副其实的诗人，不在国际上发生坏影响。可是艾青却把党对他的批评和帮助诬蔑为“党是无情的，专整人”，说他是“生活在逆境”中。
    今天的新社会对艾青这样的目空一切的个人主义者来说，的确是个“逆境”，假如他不放下臭架子，痛改前非，彻底进行思想改造，这个“逆境”还会一直“逆”下去，直到他自己的毁灭。
