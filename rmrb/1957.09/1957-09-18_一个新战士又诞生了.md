　　A New Warrior is Born
　　Ge Bizhou, you stand up from the crowd, like a slender, gentle willow; you walk out of the crowd, like a rose with dew; you face the scoundrels who妄想 (妄想 - desperately attempt) to drag the motherland back, tear your happiness, and destroy the ideals of humanity, you are like a tall poplar. You sing funeral songs of curses to the dark night, you sing endless hymns to the dawn. You suck the Party's milk in the cradle of the new society, you absolutely will not allow anyone to slander your mother! Anger burns you to tears, you raise your fist high! Let the scoundrels forever and ever curse you, the "braided girl," let the scoundrels take hatred, take hatred into the grave! You shout out: every sentence, every sentence is a knife; you bring out: every fact, every fact is a bomb; your rebuttal: every argument, every argument is a spark of truth. Sparks illuminate many kind hearts, sparks also reveal the ugly crimes of many wolves in human skin! The rightists have to bow their heads! A new warrior is born!

　　一个新战士又诞生了
　　戈壁舟你呵从人群中站起来，像细柔的垂柳；你呵从人群中走过来，像带露的玫瑰；你呵当面对着妄想把祖国拖回去撕碎你的幸福捣毁人类理想的坏蛋你又似一株呵一株高大的白杨。你给黑夜唱诅咒的送葬曲，你对着黎明唱不完的颂歌。你在新社会的摇篮里吸着党的乳汁，你呵绝不准许绝不准许谁来诬蔑你的母亲！怒火烧得你流泪，你高高举起拳头！让坏蛋们永远地永远地痛骂你这“双辫子”吧，让坏蛋们把仇恨把仇恨带进坟墓！你呼喊出：每一句话每一句话都是一把刀；你端出来：每一个事实每一个事实都是一颗炸弹；你的反驳：每一个论点每一个论点都是一朵真理的火花。火花照亮了多少颗善良的心，火花也照见了多少狼心狗肺丑恶的罪行！右派分子不得不低头了！一个新战士又诞生了！
