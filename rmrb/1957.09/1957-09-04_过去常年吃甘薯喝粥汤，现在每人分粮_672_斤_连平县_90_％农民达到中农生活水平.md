From our newspaper in Guangzhou, September 2nd: 90% of the farmers in Lianping County, Guangdong Province, have reached the living standards of local middle peasants.

Lianping is located in a mountainous area. Before liberation, the lives of the peasants were extremely difficult, constantly eating sweet potatoes and drinking thin gruel, rarely having enough to eat. In the years since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the impoverished conditions of the mountainous area have gradually changed; especially after agricultural cooperation, production has grown rapidly, and the lives of the peasants have improved significantly. Before the spring plowing of 1956, the percentage of peasant households in Lianping County that had joined cooperatives was 93.7% of the total number of peasant households. In the first year of cooperation – 1956 – total grain output increased by 15.7% compared to 1955. The average per capita grain ration for peasants reached 672 jin, an increase of 95 jin compared to 1955, and an increase of 222 jin compared to 1953. 97% of the cooperatives increased production, and 92.95% of the members increased their income; and 61.1% of the cooperatives reached the living standards of local middle peasants.

The increased production and income in 1956 proved that cooperation is incomparably superior to individual farming. This year, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has increased to more than 98% of the total number of peasant households. Agricultural and sideline production in the first half of this year has also achieved unprecedented growth. Early rice production increased by 8.56% compared to the same period last year, and the average per capita grain ration for peasants increased by another 28 jin compared to the same period last year. In particular, sideline production has developed greatly due to strengthened leadership. In the first half of the year, the average sideline income per household was 51 yuan, a fourfold increase compared to the same period last year. Due to the development of agricultural and sideline production, among the 156 cooperatives and 35,129 cooperative member households in the county, 154 cooperatives, accounting for 98.7% of the total number of cooperatives, achieved increased agricultural and sideline production in the first half of the year. 32,505 member households increased their income, accounting for 92.5% of the total number of households, of which 31,691 member households have already reached the living standards of local middle peasants, accounting for 90% of the total number of member households.

    过去常年吃甘薯喝粥汤，现在每人分粮672斤
    连平县90％农民达到中农生活水平
    本报广州2日电　广东省连平县90％的农民达到了当地中农的生活水平。
    连平地处山区。解放前，农民生活非常困苦，常年吃甘薯，喝粥汤，难得一饱。解放几年来，由于党的正确领导，逐步改变了山区的贫困面貌；特别是农业合作化以后，生产迅速增长，农民生活获得显著改善。1956年春耕前，连平县入社农户占总农户的93.7％，合作化的第一年——1956年，粮食总产量就比1955年增产15.7％。农民口粮每人平均达到六百七十二斤，比1955年增加九十五斤，比1953年增加了二百二十二斤，97％的社都增了产，92.95％的社员都增加了收入；并有61.1％的社达到了当地中农的生活水平。
    1956年的增产增收，证明了合作化比单干优越无比，今年入社农户增加到占总农户的98％以上。今年上半年农、副业又获得空前增产。早稻比去年同期增产8.56％，农民口粮平均每人又比去年同期增加二十八斤。特别是副业生产，由于加强了领导，有很大发展，上半年平均每户副业收入五十一元，比去年同期增加了四倍。由于农副业生产发展，全县一百五十六个社、三万五千一百二十九户社员中，上半年农副业获得增产的有一百五十四个社，占总社数的98.7％，社员增加收入的三万二千五百零五户，占总户数92.5％，其中有三万一千六百九十一户社员已经达到了当地中农的生活水平，占社员总户数的90％。（吴尔祥）
