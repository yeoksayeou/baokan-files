　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd: The Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the National Committee of the China Heavy Industry Trade Union recently held a meeting in Taiyuan to evaluate the inter-factory and inter-trade competitions for the first and second quarters.

　　At the meeting, through on-site evaluation at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the open-hearth steelmaking workshop of Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant was selected as the advanced unit for the first quarter. The open-hearth steelmaking workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, Benxi No. 2 Iron Plant, and others were rated as advanced units for the second quarter. These advanced units all comprehensively overfulfilled the main production targets for the first or second quarter, and each received a banner at the conference. Other units that were awarded for the first and second quarters included the open-hearth workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, the electric furnace and forged steel workshop of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and Daye Steel Plant.

　　During the nine-day meeting, experiences in leading socialist competition and technical management were also widely exchanged. The experience of Fushun, Benxi, and Dalian steel plants in signing technical assistance contracts was regarded by the conference as the highest form of inter-factory competition. Many units learned from this method at the meeting and signed technical assistance contracts. The small-scale competition of Tangshan Steel Plant and the experience of Daye Steel Plant in promoting advanced experiences were also welcomed by the conference.
