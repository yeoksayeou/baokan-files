Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd: The capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a grand military parade and a mass parade of 150,000 people this morning to warmly celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The celebration meeting was held at 6:15 a.m. Vietnamese party and state leaders, as well as the Vice President of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, Vukmanović, who was invited to visit Vietnam, received a warm welcome when they arrived at Ba Dinh Square and ascended the rostrum.

President Ho Chi Minh delivered a National Day speech. While expounding on the current struggle tasks of the Vietnamese people, he focused on reporting the results of his recent visits to fraternal countries.

Ho Chi Minh said that the solemn and cordial reception of him by the parties, governments, and people of the fraternal countries was an honor for all the Vietnamese people and the motherland, and also reflected the rock-solid relationship between socialist countries.

Ho Chi Minh said: We are very pleased to see that the socialist construction of the fraternal countries is developing very rapidly. This is the result of the people's hard work and selfless labor. At the same time, this also requires a considerable amount of effort over a long period of time.

He said that during this visit, we paid close attention to the reunification situation in Korea and Germany. When we visited Hungary, we saw the positive spirit of the people and the return to normal life. This is a major victory for the Hungarian people and a major victory for all of us.

Ho Chi Minh said that we held many talks with the leading comrades of the parties and governments of the fraternal countries, and reached unanimous views on important international issues and the relationship between Vietnam and these countries. In general, the fraternal countries and Vietnam are of one mind on everything. It can be said that our visit has been victorious. It has contributed to further strengthening the unity between the fraternal countries and further enhancing Vietnam's international status.

Ho Chi Minh also said that when he passed through Moscow, he learned that the Soviet Union had achieved brilliant success in its intercontinental ballistic missile test. This important event will play its due role in defending the cause of peace, promoting the opposition to the arms race, and demanding disarmament.

When talking about the current struggle tasks of the Vietnamese people, Ho Chi Minh called on the people to inherit the glorious tradition of the August Revolution, strengthen unity, persevere in struggle, actively build North Vietnam, strive for the reunification of the motherland, and further strengthen international solidarity with socialist countries.

Ho Chi Minh pointed out that in the three years since the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese people have made great achievements in the struggle to build North Vietnam. He said that our task this year is to basically complete the economic recovery of North Vietnam, gradually improve the people's lives, and prepare conditions to begin the construction of North Vietnam in 1958 according to a long-term plan.

Speaking of the reunification of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh said that recently, our government once again suggested to the South Vietnamese authorities to conduct contact between the two sides, restore normal relations between the North and South, and then discuss and negotiate elections to unify the country. However, the South Vietnamese authorities still refused. They are running counter to the sincere wishes of all our people. Ho Chi Minh said that Vietnam is a unified country, and no reactionary force can divide us. Vietnam must be unified!

Ho Chi Minh said that in the cause of building the country and reunifying the motherland, we have received selfless assistance from fraternal countries led by the Soviet Union and China. We have received the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, especially in Asia and Africa. Recently, the friendly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia and Laos have made much progress. The efforts of the International Commission in Vietnam have contributed to consolidating peace on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

Ho Chi Minh concluded by saying that thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the assistance of fraternal countries, and the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to complete the glorious tasks put forward by the Party and the government.

After President Ho Chi Minh's speech, a grand military parade was held. The mighty military appearance of the various branches of the Vietnam People's Army passing through the reviewing stand showed the people the powerful strength of this country on the eastern frontier of the socialist camp to defend peace.

General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, inspected the various troops at the beginning of the military parade and issued orders to the army. Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out in his order that North and South Vietnam have not yet been unified, and the United States is increasingly intensifying its interference in South Vietnam. He ordered the People's Army to continuously improve its fighting spirit, heighten revolutionary vigilance, defend the socialist cause in the North, and make the North a backing for the struggle for peaceful reunification of the country.

The enthusiastic mass parade began after the military parade. Huge contingents of workers, peasants, young students, government cadres, people from all walks of life, ethnic minorities, and sports and art teams passed in front of the rostrum one after another, warmly cheering their leaders and distinguished guests. Countless flags, flowers, placards, portraits of leaders, and models of increased production charts formed a magnificent torrent. The people of Hanoi continued to carry out various recreational activities and sports competitions this afternoon to celebrate this great festival. In the evening, beautiful fireworks were set off on the banks of Hoan Kiem Lake and Thien Quang Lake in the city center, which were decorated with colorful lights.

Last night, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong held a grand National Day reception at the Presidential Palace.

At 5:00 p.m. that day, President Ho, accompanied by responsible persons from the National Assembly, the Government, the Fatherland Front, and various political parties, went to the Martyrs' Memorial to lay a wreath. (Attached picture)

    越南人民热烈庆祝国庆
    胡志明号召积极建设北越争取全国统一
    本报综合报道  据新华社河内2日电：越南民主共和国首都今天上午举行了盛大的阅兵式和有十五万人参加的群众游行，热烈庆祝越南民主共和国宣告独立的十二周年。
    庆祝大会在上午六时十五分举行。越南党和国家领导人以及应邀到越南访问的南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇在到达巴亭广场和登上主席台的时候，受到了热烈的欢迎。
    胡志明主席发表了国庆演说。在阐述越南人民当前的斗争任务的同时，他着重报告了最近到各兄弟国家访问的结果。
    胡志明说，各兄弟国家党、政府和人民对他的隆重、亲切的接待，是全体越南人民和祖国的荣誉，同时也体现了社会主义各国之间坚如磐石的关系。
    胡志明说：我们非常高兴地看到兄弟国家的社会主义建设事业发展得非常迅速。这是由于人民艰苦奋斗、忘我劳动的结果。同时，这也需要一个相当长的时间的努力。
    他说，这次访问，我们着重注意到朝鲜和德国的统一情况。当我们到匈牙利访问时，看到了人民的积极精神和生活的恢复正常，这是匈牙利人民的重大胜利，也是我们大家的重大胜利。
    胡志明说，我们同各兄弟国家党和政府的领导同志举行了多次会谈，在重要的国际问题和越南同这些国家的关系问题上，彼此取得了一致的看法。总的来说，各兄弟国家同越南之间，对于一切事情都是情投意合。可以说，我们的访问已经获得胜利，它已为进一步密切各兄弟国家之间的团结作出贡献，进一步提高了越南在国际上的地位。
    胡志明还说，他路过莫斯科的时候知道苏联在进行洲际弹道火箭试验中已经获得辉煌胜利。这个重要事件对于保卫和平事业、促进反对武装竞赛、要求裁减军备的斗争将起着它应有的作用。
    在谈到越南人民当前的斗争任务的时候，胡志明号召人民继承八月革命的光荣传统，加强团结、坚持奋斗，积极建设北越，争取祖国的统一，并且进一步加强同各社会主义国家的国际团结。
    胡志明指出，和平恢复三年以来，越南人民在建设北越的斗争中已取得巨大的成就。他说，我们今年的任务是基本完成北越经济恢复、使人民生活逐步得到改善，并且准备条件以便在1958年着手按照长期计划建设北越。
    谈到越南的统一问题时，胡志明说，最近，我们政府再一次向南越政权建议进行双方之间的接触、恢复北南正常关系，进而讨论协商进行选举以统一国家的问题。但是，南越政权仍然拒绝。他们是同我们全体人民的切身愿望背道而驰的。胡志明说，越南是一个统一的国家，任何反动力量都不能分割我们。越南一定要得到统一！
    胡志明说，在建设国家、统一祖国的事业中，我们得到了以苏联、中国为首的兄弟国家的无私援助。我们得到了世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持，尤其是亚非各国。最近越南同柬埔寨和老挝之间的友谊关系已经有许多进步。国际委员会在越南的努力，对于在日内瓦协议的基础上巩固和平的事业曾经作出贡献。
    胡志明最后说，由于党和政府的正确领导，由于各兄弟国家的援助，由于世界爱好和平人民的支持，越南人民一定能够完成党和政府提出的光荣任务。
    在胡志明主席演说结束以后举行了盛大的阅兵式。通过主席台前的受检阅的越南人民军各兵种的队伍的威武军容，向人们显示了这个处在社会主义阵营东方前哨的国家的保卫和平的强大力量。
    越南人民军总司令武元甲大将在阅兵式开始的时候检阅了各个部队，并且向军队发布了命令。武元甲在命令中指出，越南北方和南方还没有统一，美国越来越加强对南越的干涉，他命令人民军要不断地提高战斗精神，提高革命警惕性，保卫北方的社会主义事业，使北方成为和平统一国家斗争的后盾。
    热烈的群众游行在阅兵式后开始。工人、农民、青年学生、机关干部、各界人民、少数民族、以及体育文艺大队等庞大队伍先后在主席台前走过，向自己的领袖和贵宾热烈欢呼。无数的旗帜、花朵、标语牌、领袖像和增产图表模型等，汇成了壮丽的巨流。河内人民在今天下午继续展开各种文娱活动和体育比赛来欢度这个伟大的节日。晚间，在市中心的披上了彩灯的还剑湖和天光湖畔，放出美丽的焰火。
    昨天晚上，范文同总理在主席府举行了盛大的国庆招待会。
    当天下午五时，胡主席由国会、政府、祖国战线和各政党的负责人陪同，前往烈士纪念台献花圈。（附图片）
