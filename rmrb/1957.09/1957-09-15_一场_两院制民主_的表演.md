A Performance of “Bicameral Democracy”
Shi Lü
    The calendar has already been torn to the last week of August, and the first half of the 85th U.S. Congress’s session has been scheduled to close this week. The congressmen are actively packing their bags, preparing to leave Washington and return to their hometowns to "hunt for votes" in preparation for the congressional elections next year. However, for Mr. Knowland (Senate Republican Leader), Mr. Johnson (Senate Democratic Leader), Mr. Martin (House Republican Leader), and Mr. Rayburn (House Democratic Leader), they still have to strike a deal on a civil rights bill before the adjournment.

    Speaking of which, this is an "old old" problem. Ever since Congress passed a law in 1875 stating that "citizens of all races and colors, regardless of whether they were formerly slaves, should enjoy complete and equal rights..." the American people, especially Black people, have been demanding the formulation of practical measures to ensure the implementation of this law. In order to show "understanding of the people's sentiments," every U.S. president has had to submit a civil rights bill to Congress. In Congress, the House of Representatives kicks it to the Senate, and the Senate kicks it into the wastepaper basket, waiting for the next president to pick it out of the wastepaper basket and hand it over to Congress again. This continuous play of "democracy" has been performed for eighty-two years now.

    However, this play is now a little difficult to continue. Firstly, the pressure from the domestic people is increasing (for example, on May 17th of this year, more than 30,000 Black representatives flocked to Washington to demand civil rights); secondly, the U.S. government's connivance at racial discrimination is already too notorious abroad. Therefore, it is necessary to pass something in Congress that can be beautifully called a "civil rights bill" to appease the American people internally and deceive world public opinion externally.

    With an eye on the mid-term congressional elections next year and the 1960 general election, the congressional leaders of both parties are trying their best to grab political capital on this widely influential issue. The Republican Party, through Eisenhower, proposed a bill that stipulates that the federal government can force states to implement laws protecting civil rights, and federal judges can sentence those who violate the civil rights of Black citizens to imprisonment or fines without a jury. These civil rights include not only the voting rights of Black people, but also general civil rights such as the right of Black people to attend any public school. The content of this bill is only the minimum requirement of Black people. However, the Republican leaders put it forward as the "maximum program," which means that the Republican Party does not really want to see this bill become law. Their purpose is to use this grand-sounding bill to win people's hearts and minds, while embarrassing its opponent, the Democratic Party.

    However, the Democratic Party's congressional leaders are also masters of political manipulation. They have long seen through the Republican Party's political tricks, so on the one hand, they announced that the Democratic Party will not adopt delaying tactics this year to obstruct the passage of this bill in order to win people's hearts; on the other hand, they are rubbing their fists and gathering strength, preparing to seize the initiative from the Republican Party and create favorable conditions for future bargaining. After this Republican bill was kicked from the House of Representatives to the Senate, Southern Democratic senators gathered some Northern Democratic senators, and even pulled eighteen Republican senators together, forming a majority, and made "amendments" to the Republican original bill. As a result of the amendments, the federal enforcement power was limited to the issue of Black people's voting rights, and the provisions of the original bill regarding the protection of Black people's general civil rights were abolished. The amended bill also re-stipulated that federal judges must go through a jury when convicting those who violate Black people's voting rights. In the Southern states of the United States, juries are always composed of white racists, so this provision is tantamount to letting cats protect mice.

    Using such a "revision" method, the Democratic Party dispelled the Republican Party's "maximum program" and took the bill into its own hands. It is worth pondering how the eighteen Republican senators were pulled to vote alongside the Southern Democrats. It's very simple, the Southern Democrats just threatened slightly, saying: either cooperate with us, or we will propose opposition in Congress to the construction of certain water conservancy projects by private electric power capital. For those Republican senators who serve the electric power monopoly capital groups, this threat is of course immediately effective.

    The Democratic Party took the upper hand in the first round. But the Republican Party's congressional leaders also understand that the Democratic Party's "amendment" is just a political tactic, and the deal is far from over. Now it's the turn of Knowland, Johnson, Martin, and Rayburn to conduct concrete bargaining.

    The bargaining unfolded on the issue of whether federal judges must go through a jury when convicting those who violate Black people's voting rights. On the Republican side, they only require to nominally maintain the power of federal judges to convict without a jury, so that they can use this to publicize that Black people's voting rights have been guaranteed and boast about the "merit" of the Republican Party; as for whether Black people's rights are truly guaranteed, it was never something worth their trouble. Therefore, the Republican Party offered a price: if the Democratic Party does not insist on going through a jury, the Republican Party can agree to limit the power of federal judges to convict in cases of infringement of Black people's voting rights to imposing light detention and fines. On the Democratic side, they only require that federal intervention does not truly prevent racists from infringing on Black people's rights, and can ensure that racists will not be severely punished after trampling on Black people, so that not only the skin of racists will not be hurt, but the Democratic Party can also not bear the notoriety of obstructing the civil rights bill, so what is there that cannot be compromised! In this way, the biggest deal in the first half of the 85th U.S. Congress’s session was concluded. The process of bargaining in the final stage, apart from some red tape, was conducted in the following very straightforward manner between Senate Republican Leader Knowland and Democratic Leader Johnson:

    Knowland: We propose that federal judges can sentence to ninety days of detention and a fine of three hundred dollars.
    Johnson: We only agree to thirty days and two hundred dollars.
    Knowland: We can concede to sixty days and three hundred dollars.
    Johnson: We can raise it to forty-five days and three hundred dollars.
    Both parties agree: A deal is a deal, forty-five days and three hundred dollars.

    The much-publicized "civil rights bill" was finally established. The U.S. "Time" magazine humorously called it "a compromise of a compromise of a compromise." A performance of "bicameral democracy" ended here. The Republican and Democratic parties are all happy, and the congressmen have gone home on vacation; however, what practical benefits have the American Black people who have suffered humiliation for many years actually gained, that is only God knows.

### 一场“两院制民主”的表演

　　一场“两院制民主”的表演
　　施旅
    日历已经撕到8月的最后一个星期，美国第八十五届国会的前半期会议已经内定要在这个星期闭会。议员先生们都在积极清理行装，准备离开华盛顿，回到各人的家乡去“猎取选票”以迎接明年的国会选举了。但是，对诺兰（参议院共和党领袖）、约翰逊（参议院民主党领袖）、马丁（众议院共和党领袖）和雷朋（众议院民主党领袖）这四位先生说来，他们还要在闭会之前，就一项公民权利法案作成一笔交易。
    说起来，这是“老老年”的问题了。打从1875年国会通过了一项“一切种族和各种肤色的公民，不论他们以前是不是奴隶，都应享有完全平等的权利……”的法律以后，美国人民特别是黑种人民就一直要求制定切实办法来保证执行这条法律。为了表现“体察民情”，美国历任总统都要把一项公民权利法案提给国会。在国会里，众议院把它踢给参议院，参议院又把它踢进字纸篓里，等下任总统从字纸篓里拣出再交到国会来。这种“民主”的连台戏，于今已演了八十有二年了。
    但是，如今这场戏有一点难以再玩下去了。一来，国内人民的压力越来越大（譬如今年5月17日这一天，一下子就有三万多黑人代表涌到华盛顿来要求民权）；二来，美国政府纵容种族歧视的事情，在国外实在是已经太臭了。因此，有必要在国会里通过一套可以美其名为“公民权利法案”的东西，对内敷衍美国人民，对外蒙蔽世界舆论。
    着眼于明年的国会中期选举和1960年的大选，两党的国会领袖都竭力想在这个影响甚广的问题上大捞一把政治资本。共和党经过艾森豪威尔提出了一项法案，其内容规定联邦政府可以强制各州执行保护民权的法律，联邦法官可以不经过陪审团而对侵犯了黑人公民权利的人判以徒刑或罚款，这个公民权利不但包括黑人的投票权，也包括一般民权如黑人进入任何公立学校读书的权利等。这项法案的内容不过是黑人的最低限度的要求。但是，共和党的头子们却把它作为“最高纲领”提出，这就意味着实际上共和党并不真正想看到这项法案成为法律。他们的目的是利用这个冠冕堂皇的法案来笼络人心，同时使它的对手民主党为难而已。
    然而，民主党的国会领袖们也是玩弄政治的高手。他们早就看穿共和党的政治把戏，所以一方面宣布民主党今年将不采取拖延战术来阻挠这个法案的通过，以争取人心；一方面摩拳擦掌，聚集力量，准备把主动权从共和党手中夺取过来，为日后的讨价还价创造有利条件。当这项共和党的法案从众议院被踢到参议院以后，南方民主党议员纠集了一部分北方民主党议员，甚至还拉了十八名共和党议员在一起，凑成多数，对共和党的原案作了“修正”。修正的结果，联邦的强制执行权只限于黑人投票权问题上，原法案关于保护黑人一般民权的规定被废弃了。修正后的法案还重新规定联邦法官在对侵犯黑人投票权的人判罪时必须通过陪审团。在美国南方各州，陪审团总是由白人种族主义分子组成的，因此这项规定等于让猫去保护耗子。
    用这样一种“修正”的办法，民主党打消了共和党的“最高纲领”，把这法案拿到了自己的手中。值得玩味的是，那十八名共和党议员怎么会被拉去同南方民主党人并肩投票的呢？说来也很简单，南方民主党人只是稍稍威胁一下说：要末同我们合作，要末我们就在国会提出反对由私人电业资本兴建某些水利工程。对那些为电业垄断资本集团服务的共和党议员说来，这种威胁当然是马上见效的。
    民主党在第一回合里占了上风。但是共和党的国会领袖也懂得，民主党的“修正”不过是一种政治手腕，交易远没有结束。现在轮到诺兰、约翰逊、马丁和雷朋进行具体的讨价还价了。
    讨价还价是在联邦法官在对侵犯黑人投票权的人判罪时是不是必须通过陪审团这一问题上展开的。在共和党这一方面，他们只要求在名义上能维持联邦法官不通过陪审团判罪的权力，以便他们可以借此宣传黑人的投票权已有保障，并吹嘘共和党的“功劳”；至于黑人的权利是否真正得到保障，那本来就不是值得他们去伤脑筋的事。因此，共和党开出了价钱：如果民主党不坚持要通过陪审团，共和党是可以同意把联邦法官在处理侵犯黑人投票权案件时判罪权力限于判处不重的拘禁和罚款。在民主党这一方面，他们也只要求联邦的干涉不至于真正妨碍种族主义分子去侵犯黑人的权利，并且能保证种族主义分子在蹂躏黑人之后不会受到严办，这样，既不伤种族主义分子的皮毛，民主党又可以不背上阻挠公民权利法案的恶名，那又有什么不可以妥协的呢！就是这样，美国第八十五届国会前半期会议上最大的一宗交易成交了。最后阶段的讨价还价的过程，除去某些繁文缛节，就是在参议院共和党领袖诺兰和民主党领袖约翰逊之间，以下述十分直捷了当的方式进行的：
    诺兰：我们建议联邦法官可以宣判拘禁九十天，罚款三百元。
    约翰逊：我们只同意三十天和二百元。
    诺兰：我们可以让步到六十天和三百元。
    约翰逊：我们可以提高到四十五天和三百元。
    双方协议：一言为定，四十五天和三百元。
    宣传得很多的“公民权利法案”总算成立了。美国“时代”周刊幽默地称之为“一个妥协的妥协的妥协”。一场“两院制民主”的表演至此结束。共和、民主两党皆大欢喜，国会议员们纷纷回家休假去；可是，多少年来受尽屈辱的美国黑人究竟得到了什么实惠，那就是天晓得了。
