The Long Couplet of Daguan Pavilion in Kunming and its Author
    Xu Jiarui
    Those who have visited Daguan Pavilion in Kunming may have seen the following long couplet there:

    Five hundred li of Dianchi Lake rush into view; with unbuttoned collar and turban askew, joyfully boundless. See: To the east, the divine steed rears; to the west, the spirit bird soars; to the north, the dragon winds; to the south, the white crane dances. Eminent scholars and refined gentlemen, why not choose this scenic spot to ascend? Taking advantage of the crab islets and snail isles, to arrange a coiffure of wind-blown clouds; moreover, reed lands in the sky, adorned with emerald feathers and crimson clouds. Do not waste the fragrant rice paddies all around, the ten thousand acres of clear sand, the lotuses of summer, the willows of spring.

    Thousands of years of past events flood the mind; holding wine, soaring into the void. Alas, where are the mighty heroes of the rolling ages? Imagine: the Han practicing naval warfare, the Tang marking iron pillars, the Song wielding jade axes, the Yuan crossing with leather sacks. Great achievements and meritorious deeds, exhausting the strength to move mountains. Even beaded curtains and painted halls cannot block the twilight rain and morning clouds; then broken steles and ruined monuments are entrusted to the misty haze and setting sun. Only winning a few strokes of a sparse bell, half a river of fishing lights, two rows of autumn geese, and a pillow of blue frost.

    The author of this couplet is Sun Ran from the Kangxi and Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty. Originally from Sanyuan, Shaanxi, he was intelligent as a child and later moved to Kunming, Yunnan with his father. He grew up to be erudite and knowledgeable, excelling in poetry and prose, and his name was highly regarded at the time.

    Although he had a great reputation, he refused to take the imperial examinations. Zhang Dongge, the Governor-General of Yunnan at the time, once commissioned someone to urge him to take the exam, but he refused, calling himself "The Great Commoner of Wanshu Garden." He sometimes wrote satirical poems, for example, when he visited Dali and saw Wang, the prefect of Dali, being lazy and neglecting his duties, he satirized him, saying: "The Dragon King does not send rain for transplanting rice seedlings, hiding in Cangshan Mountain, basking in the sun all day." Because he refused to take the imperial examinations and liked to write satirical poems, the officials at the time were dissatisfied with him. He was impoverished all his life, and in his old age, he made a living by divination, often going hungry for days.

    The upper part of this long couplet in Daguan Pavilion describes the scenery of Dianchi Lake and the hard work of the farmers, while the lower part describes the history related to Yunnan. However, the rulers thought that there were sentences in it that violated the taboos of the time. In the early years of Daoguang, the Governor-General of Yunnan, Ruan Yuan (Ruan Yuntai), changed it, but he changed it very badly, turning the most beautiful and poetic sentences into dead phrases. The people of Yunnan thought that Ruan Yuan was meddling, so there was a satirical proverb about Ruan Yuan: "The soft tobacco pipe (Ruan Yuntai) is not good, only turnips, chives and onions; daring to change the couplets of the ancients, embarrassing old man Sun Ran." Due to public criticism, the original couplet was retained.

    Why did Ruan Yuan want to change this couplet? He said: Sun Ran's original couplet mainly focused on the orthodox Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, attributing their meritorious achievements to nothingness, wouldn't that be gradually talking about our dynasty (Qing)? Therefore, he changed "Great achievements and meritorious deeds" to "Incite the long-standing Mongol chieftains," and passed it on to Wu Sangui and others, in order to support the righteous and eliminate the rebellious. Supporting the righteous and eliminating the rebellious was Ruan Yuan's servile ideology, while Sun Ran regarded the orthodox imperial dynasties as impermanent illusions, and the great achievements and meritorious deeds as "broken steles and ruined monuments" in the "setting sun in the west," which was a rebellious thought at the time. Ruan Yuan made many changes, all of which were very bad. In addition to Ruan Yuan, there was also Cheng Hanzhang, who also changed this original couplet, the most important change being to change the original "Great achievements and meritorious deeds, exhausting the strength to move mountains" to "Great achievements and meritorious deeds, aspiring to be in harmony with heaven and earth." This shows how displeasing this couplet was to the rulers and their servants at the time. (Attached picture)

    昆明大观楼的长对联及作者
    徐嘉瑞
    游过昆明大观楼的人，都可能见到那里的如下一副长对联：
    五百里滇池，奔来眼底，披襟岸帻，喜茫茫空阔无边。看：东骧神骏，西翥灵仪，北走蜿蜒，南翔缟素。高人韵士，何妨选胜登临。趁蟹屿螺洲，梳裹就风鬟雾鬓；更苹天苇地，点缀些翠羽丹霞。莫孤负四围香稻，万顷晴沙，九夏芙蓉，三春杨柳。
    数千年往事，注到心头，把酒凌虚。叹滚滚英雄谁在？想：汉习楼船，唐标铁柱，宋挥玉斧，元跨革囊。伟烈丰功，费尽移山心力。尽珠帘画栋，卷不及暮雨朝云；便断碣残碑，都付与苍烟落照。只赢得几杵疏钟，半江渔火，两行秋雁，一枕青霜。
    这副对联的作者是清康熙、乾隆年间的孙髯。他原籍陕西三原，幼时聪明，后随父流寓云南昆明。长成博学多识，善诗文，名重一时。
    他虽有重名，却不肯应科举。当时云南总督张东阁，曾委人催他去应试，他拒绝不去，自称“万树园大布衣”。他有时还作讽刺诗，例如他游大理时，见大理府王某，懒不治事，便讽刺他说：“龙王不下栽秧雨，躲在苍山响日头。”他既不肯科举，又好写讽刺诗，惹得当时官吏，对他不满。终身穷困，年老时，卜易为活，常常数日断炊。
    大观楼这副长联，上联写滇池风光，和农民的辛勤劳动，下联写有关云南的历史。但统治者以为其中有触犯当时忌讳的句子，道光初年云南总督阮元（阮芸台）把它改了，但改得很坏，把最优美的有诗意的句子改成一些死句。云南人以为阮元多事，便有讽刺阮元的谚语：软烟袋（阮芸台）不通，萝卜韭菜葱，擅改古人对，笑煞孙髯翁。”由于群众的指责，原联又保留下来。
    阮元为什么要改这副对联呢？他说：孙髯原联，以正统之汉、唐、宋、元、纬业丰功总归一空为主，岂不駸駸乎说到我朝（清）？故改“伟烈丰功”为“衅长蒙酋”，递到吴三桂等人身上，为的是扶正消逆。扶正消逆是阮元的奴才思想，而孙髯却把正统皇朝，看做是不长久的幻影，把伟烈丰功，看做是“落阳西照”里的“断碣残碑”，在当时说来，是一种叛逆思想。阮元修改了许多地方，都改得很坏。除了阮元之外，还有一个程含章，也改过这副原联，最重要的是把原对“伟烈丰功，费尽移山心力”改为“伟烈丰功，举欲同符天地”。足见这副对联，在当时统治者和他的奴才们看来，是多么不顺眼。（附图片）
