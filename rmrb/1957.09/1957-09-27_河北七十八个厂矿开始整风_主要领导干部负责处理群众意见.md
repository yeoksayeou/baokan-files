Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 26th. The first group of seventy-eight industrial and mining enterprises in six cities in Hebei Province, including Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Qinhuangdao, have successively begun the rectification campaign.

In many factories and mines, within two or three days of the start of the "speaking out" (mingfang), workers had posted nearly a thousand colorful big-character posters. The opinions of the masses of workers are very sharp, but the vast majority of opinions revolve closely around the central issue of running socialist enterprises well.

Leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises in various places warmly welcome and support the criticisms of the workers. They take time every day to view the big-character posters several times, promptly understand the ideological situation of the workers, talk to individual workers who have concerns about speaking out, and encourage them to speak out boldly. The work improvement organizations established in each unit are also led by the main leading cadres of the factory. In order to handle the opinions put forward by the masses in a timely manner, many Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres are busy until late at night every day, and do not rest on Sundays. The Kailuan Coal Mine has already solved more than 290 problems in a few days.

The Hebei Provincial Party Committee and local municipal Party committees have also established specialized institutions to lead the rectification campaign, and have dispatched nearly one hundred cadres to go deep into factories and mines to provide specific assistance and guidance.

    河北七十八个厂矿开始整风
    主要领导干部负责处理群众意见
    据新华社保定26日电　河北省唐山、石家庄、保定、秦皇岛等六个市的第一批七十八个工矿企业已经先后开始整风。
    不少厂矿在鸣放开始后两三天内，职工就贴出了近千张五光十色的大字报。职工群众的意见十分尖锐，但是绝大多数的意见都是紧紧围绕着办好社会主义企业这一个中心问题而提出来的。
    各地工矿企业的领导干部热忱地欢迎和支持职工的批评。他们每天都抽出时间去观看几次大字报，及时了解职工思想情况，对个别有鸣放顾虑的职工进行谈话，鼓励他们大胆鸣放。各单位成立的改进工作机构，也由工厂的主要领导干部负责。为了及时处理群众提出的意见，许多党、政、工、团干部每天忙到深夜，星期日也不休息。开滦煤矿在几天内已经解决了二百九十多个问题。
    中共河北省委和各地市委也都成立专门领导整风的机构，并且抽出近百名干部深入厂矿具体帮助指导。
