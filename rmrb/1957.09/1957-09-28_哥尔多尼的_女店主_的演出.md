    Today, commemorating the 250th anniversary of Goldoni's birth, the advanced training class for teachers of the Central Academy of Drama performed his famous comedy "The Mistress of the Inn."
    The mistress of the inn, Mirandolina, is a young girl. She lost her mother when she was young and her father not long ago. Life has taught her much about the ways of the world. She works diligently, attending to the guests at the inn. Among the guests staying at her inn are a wealthy Count and a reputable Marquis who are pursuing her. They shower Mirandolina with attention, seeking to win her love with expensive gifts and their protection. However, the clever Mirandolina understands their impure motives. She treats them with politeness but maintains a distance, not giving them any opportunity for impertinence. She lives a free and independent life, admired in this way. At this time, a guest arrives at the inn, a Knight who despises and hates women. Driven by curiosity, Mirandolina wants to conquer this heart of stone. At first, the Knight embarrasses her, scolding her unreasonably, but later the Knight becomes emotional and completely loses his reason. He roars and chases her madly, scaring Mirandolina to the point where she has nowhere to hide. She feels that she can no longer play this dangerous game. She chooses a diligent servant as her life partner. Her choice greatly surprises those with fame and fortune. But the audience believes that they will live a happy life. In this play, Goldoni affirms the laboring, self-reliant commoners, affirms their wisdom and their positive attitude towards life, and mocks the shamelessness and incompetence of the aristocracy. The well-fed, idle aristocrats and the optimistic, self-reliant commoners form the main conflict of the play.
    This play is directed by the Soviet drama expert Guryev. The director's rich imagination can be seen throughout the performance. As the curtain rises, the day gradually dawns, and the life of a small Italian city begins. People wake up from their sleep, servants begin to shine shoes and tidy up the rooms, and gradually the noise and quarrels begin, beggars come in to beg, a carriage passes by, carrying two actresses… Thanks to the director's meticulous handling, we see the life of a small Italian city in the 18th century.
    Judging from the director's work with the actors, expert Guryev also put in a lot of effort. The actors in this play have made significant progress compared to their past performances. For example, the actors playing the mistress of the inn, the Knight, the Marquis... even the actors playing the servants with very few scenes have created vivid images.
    The director's use of music and dance makes this play even more rich and colorful.
    Goldoni's "The Mistress of the Inn" has a performance history of two hundred years and has been tested by tens of thousands of audiences. Today, appearing on the Chinese stage, it is equally warmly welcomed by the audience. It truly reflects the rich and colorful life of 18th-century Italy, writes about various distinct and vivid characters, and fully satirizes and mocks the declining and dying class, affirming the diligent, optimistic, kind, and healthy commoners. Goldoni's lifelong struggle and creation not only made outstanding contributions to the reform of Italian drama, but also enriched the world's cultural treasure. He is a dramatist loved by progressive humanity around the world. The wisdom, humor, fun, and optimism he gives to people will make people forever grateful!

    哥尔多尼的“女店主”的演出
    孙维世
    在纪念哥尔多尼诞生二百五十周年的今天，中央戏剧学院师资进修班演出了他著名的喜剧“女店主”。
    女店主米兰多林娜是一个年轻的姑娘，她从小就没有母亲，不久前又失去了父亲，生活使她懂得很多人情世故。她勤劳地工作着，应付着店里的客人们。住在她店里的客人中，有一个有钱伯爵和一个有名望的侯爵在追求她，他们向米兰多林娜献殷勤，想用贵重的礼物和对她的保护，来取得她的爱情，但是聪明伶俐的米兰多林娜了解他们不纯的动机，她对待他们是有礼貌而又有距离，不给他们任何放肆的机会。她就是这样被人爱慕着过着自由自在的生活。这时，店里来了一个客人，他是一个瞧不起女人、仇视女人的骑士。米兰多林娜为好奇心所驱使，想去征服一下那位铁石心肠的人。起先那位骑士使她很难堪，无理地对她申斥，但是后来骑士动情了，完全丧失了理智，他咆哮着，疯狂地追逐着，吓得米兰多林娜无处藏身，她感到不能再玩这种危险的游戏了，她选择了一个勤劳的仆人作为自己的终身伴侣。她的选择使得那些有名望有财产的人大为吃惊。但是观众们相信，他们会幸福的生活。在这个戏里，哥尔多尼肯定了那些劳动的自食其力的平民，肯定了他们的智慧，他们对生活所采取的积极的态度，嘲笑了贵族的无耻和无能。饱食终日的贵族和乐观地自食其力的平民形成这个戏的主要矛盾。
    这个戏是由苏联戏剧专家古里也夫导演的。从整个演出可以看出导演丰富的想像力。幕一拉开，天渐渐地亮了，意大利小城市一天的生活开始了，人们从睡眠中醒了过来，仆人们开始刷皮鞋，整理屋子，渐渐地开始了喧哗，吵架，要饭的进来行乞，一辆马车走过，载来了两个女演员……，由于导演细致的处理，使我们看到了十八世纪意大利小城市的生活。
    从导演对演员的工作来看，古里也夫专家也下了很大的功夫，在这个戏里的演员和他们过去的表演比较起来是有着显著的进步。如演女店主，骑士，侯爵……甚至戏很少的演仆人的演员都创造了鲜明的形象。
    导演对于音乐和舞蹈的运用，更使得这个戏显得丰富多彩。
    哥尔多尼的“女店主”，已有两百年的演出历史，受了成千成万观众的考验，今天出现在中国的舞台上，同样受到观众热烈的欢迎。它真实地反映了十八世纪意大利丰富多彩的生活，写出了各种不同性格活生生的人物，尽情的讽刺和嘲笑了没落死亡的阶级，肯定了勤劳，乐观，善良，健康的平民。哥尔多尼毕生所进行的斗争和创作，不仅对意大利的戏剧改革有着卓越的贡献，也丰富了世界文化宝藏。他是世界进步人类所热爱的戏剧家，他所给予人们的智慧、幽默、趣味、乐观的精神，将使人们永久的感谢！
