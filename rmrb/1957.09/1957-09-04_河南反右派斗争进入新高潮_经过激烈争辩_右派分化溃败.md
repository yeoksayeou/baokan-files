    Henan's Anti-Rightist Struggle Enters a New Climax
    After Intense Debates, Rightists Disintegrate and Collapse

    (Our Dispatch) The anti-Rightist struggle in Henan Province, which is deepening step by step, has entered its second climax. The exposure of the main Rightist groups at the sixth session of the Henan Provincial People's Congress, the isolation and disintegration of Rightist elements, and the beginning of Rightist elements to lower their heads and admit their guilt have all initially demonstrated the great achievements of this stage of the movement.

    During the group discussions from August 23 to 28, the representatives, based on facts and reasoning, repeatedly pursued and besieged Rightist elements such as Zhang Zhonglu, Wang Yizhai, Liu Jixue, Guo Zhongkui, Luo Shengwu, Su Jinshan, Xu Lingqing, Li Baohe, Yu Pinsan, and Wang Yanqing. They engaged in fierce debates with them, finally defeating their anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist arrogance, and exposing their conspiracies. At the same time, they raised the political awareness of the masses and strengthened their own ranks. Facts have proven that in the mass debate, Rightist elements of all stripes cannot conceal their sinful words and deeds. Some began to collapse, surrendering their weapons, while those who stubbornly resisted were completely isolated. Zhang Zhonglu, a veteran Rightist element and major general of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Henan, initially confessed that he was instructed by Zhang Yunchuan and Wang Yifan to secretly plan the large-scale development of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Henan to expand anti-Communist forces. He said that while he was attending the business work conference of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League in Beijing, Zhang and Wang discussed with him separately, asking him to be the person in charge of the provincial Peasants' and Workers' Party. Zhang and Wang encouraged him, saying: Although the Peasants' and Workers' Party is a small party, it has great potential for development. In the future, when the CPPCC is changed to an upper house, the country will become a bicameral system and be able to participate in national leadership. They instructed him that the policy for developing the Peasants' and Workers' Party was not to develop people close to the Party, but to develop elements dissatisfied with the Party. Zhang Zhonglu also said that after accepting Zhang and Wang's instructions, he thought that Zhang Bojun was the person in charge of the Peasants' and Workers' Party and the Minister of Communications. If he could get a Peasants' and Workers' Party leader, it would be easier to contact Zhang, which would be greatly beneficial to his job and other aspects. In addition, Zhang Zhonglu also admitted that he resonated with Huang Shaohong's attack on judicial work, Zhang Bojun's proposal for a "political design institute," and Chu Anping's "Party's world." He admitted that his denial of the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, dissatisfaction with the policy of unified purchase and sale, and conspiracy to oppose the Party under the guise of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" were wrong. Wang Yizhai, another chieftain of the Rightist elements, began to admit his reactionary sins of having the same goals and actions as the Zhang-Luo alliance, changing from a attitude of denial and playing tricks. He admitted that he was an individualistic ambitionist and that calling for having power without responsibility meant wanting to monopolize power. He said that he had no hatred for counter-revolutionary elements, saying that he could find warmth among these people. He also admitted that he was a two-faced person who was hot on the outside and cold on the inside towards the new society, and that his vicious attacks on the Party during the blooming and contending period were a concentrated expression of his anti-Party thoughts and intentional fabrication and distortion of facts. After the representatives presented conclusive evidence, the stubborn Rightist element Liu Jixue admitted that he and Wang Yizhai, Li Jingzhi, Guo Zhongkui, and others were a Rightist group and that Wang was the leader of the group. This year, Zhang Yunchuan came to Henan and first went to his house, and then to Wang Yizhai's house to discuss the development of the organization. Luo Shengwu, who was disguised as a progressive educator, consistently refused to admit his alliance with Zhang Zhonglu, Wang Yizhai, and others, and tried every possible means to deny his reactionary crimes. However, the representatives exposed the ugliness of these Rightist elements completely. Everyone believed that when he was the principal of Zhengzhou Normal College, he was not running education but carrying out the activities of a political ambitionist. Zhang Yunchuan, the fierce general of the Zhang-Luo alliance, had a secret conversation with him when he came to Zhengzhou. He and Zhang Zhonglu and Wang Yizhai had close contacts, gathered together during the blooming and contending period to discuss anti-Party activities, and recruited eight teachers, including key counter-revolutionary renegades and those who were seriously dissatisfied with the Party, to form a small group, attempting to overthrow the Party's leadership over the school and drive away Party-member leading cadres, manipulating students to strike and petition. These facts have become clear. But he was still trying to cover up, saying that his ideology was not anti-Communist but to help the Party rectify its style. Guo Zhongkui, who refused to confess his crimes, was also angrily rebuked by the representatives.

    At the meeting, the representatives also refuted the fallacies of the Rightist elements. For example, when the representatives from Xinyang, Anyang, and Luoyang special districts reasoned with Liu Jixue, the peasant Chen Yongxing used the fact that he was exploited as a hired worker for the landlord for seven years to refute Liu Jixue's nonsense that the poor benefit from the rich, questioning Liu Jixue into a state of being speechless and unable to argue.

    河南反右派斗争进入新高潮
    经过激烈争辩　右派分化溃败
    本报讯　正在步步深入的河南省反右派斗争已经进入第二个高潮，省人民代表大会第六次会议对主要右派集团的揭发和对右派分子的分化孤立以及右派分子的开始低头认罪，都初步体现了这一阶段运动的巨大战果。
    在8月23日至28日的分组讨论会上，代表们据实说理反复追击围攻了张仲鲁、王毅斋、刘积学、郭仲隗、罗绳武、苏金伞、许凌青、李葆和、禹品三、王晏卿等右派分子，并与他们展开了激烈的争辩，终于打垮了他们反共反人民反社会主义的气焰，拆穿了他们的阴谋；同时提高了群众的政治觉悟，坚强了自己的队伍。事实证明，在群众性的大辩论中形形色色的右派分子都无法掩盖他们的罪恶言行，有的开始溃败，交出手中武器，负隅顽抗者也完全陷于孤立状态。章罗联盟在河南的大将老牌右派分子张仲鲁初步交代了受张云川、王一帆的指使，在河南秘密筹划农工民主党大发展以扩充反共势力的活动。他说他在北京参加民盟中央业务工作会议期间，张、王分别和他商谈，叫他作省农工党的负责人。张、王鼓励他说：农工党虽是小党派，但很有发展前途。将来政协改成上议院，国家就成了两院制，能参加全国领导。指示他发展农工党的方针是不发展靠近党的人，要发展对党不满的分子。张仲鲁还说自己接受张、王的指示后，就想到章伯钧是农工党负责人，又是交通部部长，自己能搞个农工党头儿将便于与章联系，对自己岗位工作和其他方面都大大有利。此外张仲鲁还承认了他对黄绍竑攻击司法工作、章伯钧倡议的“政治设计院”、储安平说的“党天下”都有共鸣，承认了他否定肃反成绩、不满统购统销政策、借“长期共存、互相监督”方针为幌子阴谋反党的错误。右派分子的另一首脑王毅斋由抵赖耍花招的态度开始承认他和章罗联盟有共同目的共同行动的反动罪恶。他承认自己是个人主义野心家，叫喊有职无权就是想独揽大权。他说，他对反革命分子没有仇恨心理，说他在这些人中间可以取得温暖；还承认他对新社会是外面热里面冷的两面派，在鸣放中对党恶毒攻击是反党思想的集中表现，是有意捏造歪曲事实。顽固的右派分子刘积学在代表们举出确凿的证据后，承认他和王毅斋、李静之、郭仲隗等是右派集团、王是集团的首领。今年张云川来河南首先到他家去，然后到王毅斋家里商讨发展组织事。披着进步教育家外衣的罗绳武在会上始终不承认自己和张仲鲁、王毅斋等的联盟，对于自己反动罪行也是百般狡赖。可是代表们将这类右派分子的丑相揭露得体无完肤。大家认为他当郑州师专校长不是在办教育而是在进行政治野心家的活动，章罗联盟的猛将张云川到郑州来和他进行过密谈，他和张仲鲁、王毅斋来往甚密，在鸣放中集会磋商反党活动，并在校内搜罗了肃反重点叛党分子和对党严重不满分子组成八教师小集团，企图推翻党对学校的领导，要把党员领导干部赶走，操纵学生罢课请愿等事实已经昭然若揭。但是他还在企图掩盖，说他思想上不是反共而是帮助党整风。拒不交代罪行的郭仲隗也遭到了代表们的愤怒斥责。
    会上，代表们还驳斥了右派分子的谬论。如信阳、安阳、洛阳专区代表和刘积学讲理时，农民陈永兴用自己给地主当了七年雇工所受剥削的事实，驳倒了刘积学的贫沾富光的胡说，把刘积学质问得理屈辞穷哑口无言。
