　　Ordinary News, Great Morality
　　Yao Wenyuan
    Carefully reading those letters from the working people, small in length but vivid in content, often provides a very profound education, especially for those intellectuals with limited vision who can only see the tip of their own noses. The following is a reader's letter clipped from the Wenhui Daily:

    This is a touching thing I saw with my own eyes.

    On the morning of July 19th, the Shanghai Shiliupu Wharf was crowded with people. The 6 o'clock boat had already left for Qinglong Port. People were waiting for the next one.

    Suddenly, a woman's cry of pain came from the crowd. I squeezed over to take a look, and it was an old woman of about fifty or sixty years old. Why was she crying? It turned out that she had bought a ticket for the 6 o'clock boat. But she was late, the boat had already left, and the ticket was invalid. The old woman didn't have much money with her, so what could she do?

    At this time, a man of about forty years old came out. He comforted the old woman: "It's okay, I'll buy you a 7 o'clock ticket." The old woman wiped away her tears and thanked him profusely. The people waiting for the boat were deeply moved by this incident. They praised one after another. Some said: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such a new atmosphere. Before liberation, Shiliupu Wharf was just a world of pickpockets and hooligans."

    I couldn't help but run over and express my respect to the comrade who generously helped. He said: "What does this count for? When people encounter unexpected difficulties, we should help solve them. Even if we suffer a little ourselves, we always feel happy in our hearts."

    After asking for a long time, he finally told me his name: "My name is Li Ruying. I am now a worker at the Shanghai Rongfeng Bicycle Factory. I am also taking the boat home to visit my family."

    Indeed, this is ordinary; such things probably happen every day in the new society. However, precisely because it is ordinary, it shows that it is not an isolated anecdote, but a common characteristic of socialist society. Therefore, this ordinariness also shines with great brilliance. This greatness is not the great achievement of any outstanding individual, but the greatness of the society itself. It tells us that in the unprecedentedly great socialist society, under the education of the Party, a brand-new moral concept of the working class has begun to permeate the cells of daily life. The universal establishment of this selfless moral concept will certainly require arduous and long-term ideological revolution, but it will inevitably be realized. Li Ruying's actions give us this unwavering confidence. With the universal establishment of this selfless moral concept, the Chinese people's thinking will rise to a new level. In the new moral appearance of the new people, we also see the prospect of communism.

    Li Ruying's language is also ordinary and simple. "When people encounter unexpected difficulties, we should help solve them. Even if we suffer a little ourselves, we always feel happy in our hearts." However, if we compare these ordinary and simple words with the right-wing anti-Party elements in literary and art circles, such as "Striving for the RMB!" (Lü Ban), "Ego-centrism!" (Feng Xuefeng), "Even if I make a mistake, the Party can't do anything to me. I have a status internationally!" (Ai Qing), "Once you write a book, no one can defeat you!" (Ding Ling)... we can immediately discover how noble and pure the heart of this ordinary worker is, and how despicable and ugly the hearts of these great intellectuals are! If these dark and ugly thoughts are not completely eradicated, it will be impossible to pass the socialist test.

    The right-wing "theorist" Wang Zhongxuan said: "A dog biting a person is not news, a person biting a dog is news." Then, this ordinary news I have extracted certainly cannot be considered "news" in Wang Zhong's eyes. However, I am happy to introduce this ordinary news to a wider range of people—especially intellectuals—as a mirror to compare themselves. We need more articles, news, and reports reflecting the growth of communist morality in socialist society. We need more news that shows greatness in the ordinary. Our life is advancing vigorously, our people are growing in self-transformation, and our socialist society is rapidly consolidating. This is a fact that the vipers who madly shout "exposing darkness" cannot erase even if they spew out all their venom!

### 平凡的新闻，伟大的道德

　　平凡的新闻，伟大的道德
　　姚文元
    仔细地读着那些篇幅虽小但内容生动的来自劳动人民中间的信件，常常可以得到非常深刻的教育，特别是对于知识分子中少数目光如豆只看到自己鼻子尖的人。下面是从文汇报上剪下来的一则读者来信：
    这是我亲眼看到的一件感人的事。
    7月19日清晨，上海十六铺码头挤满了人。六时的一班船早已开向青龙港。人们在等待着下一班。
    忽然，人群中传来一个妇女的痛哭声。我挤过去一看，是一位五、六十岁的老大娘。她为什么哭呢？原来她买的是六点钟一班的船票。但是来迟了，船已开出，船票也失效，老大娘身边又没有多的钱，怎么办呢？
    这时，一个四十岁左右的人走了出来。安慰老大娘：“不要紧，我替你买一张七时的船票吧。”老大娘擦干了眼泪千恩万谢。候船的人们深深被这件事感动了。纷纷赞叹。有的说：“只有在共产党领导下，才有这样的新风气。解放前的十六铺码头，只是那些扒手、流氓的世界。”
    我情不自禁地跑过去，向那位慷慨解囊的同志表示我的敬意。他却说：“这算得什么？人家遇到意想不到的为难之事，我们应帮助解决困难。即使自己苦一点，心里总是感到愉快的。”
    我问了半天，他才说出自己的姓名：“我叫李如英。现在是上海荣丰自行车厂的工人。我也是乘船回家去探望家人的。”
              江苏启东县通兴镇小学　李贤林
    诚然，这是平凡的，这样的事情，在新社会中每天都有吧。然而正因为平凡，却显出它并非个别的奇闻，而是社会主义社会中一种普遍的特性，因而这平凡中也闪烁着伟大的光辉。这伟大，不是任何杰出人物的丰功伟绩，而是这个社会本身的伟大。它告诉我们：在史无前例的伟大的社会主义社会中，在党的教育下，一种全新的工人阶级的道德观念已经开始渗透到日常生活的细胞中去了，这种无私的道德观念的普遍树立，固然还要经过艰苦的长久的思想革命，然而它是必将实现的，李如英的行动就给了我们这种坚定不移的信心。这种大公无私的道德观念的普遍树立，中国人民的思想就会上升到一个新的水平，在新人的全新的道德面貌中，我们也望见了共产主义的远景。
    李如英的语言也是平凡而朴素的。“人家遇到意想不到的为难之事，我们应帮助解决困难。即使自己苦一点，心里总是感到愉快的。”然而如果把这些平凡而朴素的话同文艺界的右派反党分子比较一下，什么“为人民币而奋斗！”（吕班）什么“自我中心主义！”（冯雪峰）什么“我犯了错误，党也不能怎样我，我在国际上有地位！”（艾青）什么“写出一本书来，就谁也打他不倒了！”（丁玲）……就立刻可以发现，这个普通工人的心灵是如何高贵纯洁，而这些大知识分子的心灵是多么卑鄙丑恶！这种黑暗丑恶的思想如果不加以彻底革除，要过社会主义这一关是不可能的。
    右派“理论家”王中宣传说：“狗咬人不是新闻，人咬狗才是新闻。”那么，我摘录的这条平凡的消息，在王中眼中肯定不能算“新闻”了。然而我却乐于向更广大的人——特别是向知识分子介绍这条平凡的新闻，作为一面镜子，用以对照自己。我们需要更多的反映社会主义社会中共产主义道德成长的文章、消息和报道，我们需要更多的在平凡中显示着伟大的新闻。我们的生活正在朝气勃勃地前进，我们的人民正在自我改造中成长，我们的社会主义社会正在迅速地巩固起来，这是狂叫“揭露黑暗”的蛇蝎们喷尽毒液也抹杀不了的事实！
