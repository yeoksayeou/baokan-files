Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 4th. The Foreign Affairs Committee and the Legal and Judicial Committee of the Hungarian National Assembly held a joint meeting on September 2nd to discuss the situation arising from the upcoming discussion of the so-called "Hungarian Question" at the United Nations General Assembly. The joint meeting passed a resolution protesting the report of the United Nations "Committee of Five" and the inclusion of the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

    Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath and Minister of Justice Nezval spoke at the meeting. Horvath said that the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly was a complete fabrication. The General Assembly has no right to discuss such a question, as it is entirely a matter of Hungarian internal affairs. Nezval refuted certain claims in the report of the United Nations "Committee of Five."

    The meeting resolved to suggest that the Hungarian delegation participating in the London meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union should explain the Hungarian position to the parliamentary delegations of various countries, requesting them to influence their respective governments through their national parliaments so as to adopt the necessary position when the so-called "Hungarian Question" is discussed at the United Nations General Assembly, and to urge the removal of the so-called "Hungarian Question" from the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

    联大无权讨论“匈牙利问题”
    匈牙利国民议会抗议联大非法决议
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　匈牙利国民议会外交委员会、法律和司法委员会9月2日举行联席会议，讨论联合国大会即将讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”而引起的局势。联席会议通过了抗议联合国“五人委员会”的报告和把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联合国大会议程的决议。
    匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特和司法部长内兹瓦尔在会上讲了话。霍瓦特说，联合国大会议程上的所谓“匈牙利问题”是彻头彻尾捏造出来的。大会无权讨论这样的问题，因为它完全是匈牙利的内政。内兹瓦尔驳斥了联合国“五人委员会”报告中的某些说法。
    会议在决议中建议参加各国议会联盟伦敦会议的匈牙利议员团届时向各国议员团阐述匈牙利方面的立场，要求各国议员团通过本国的议会来影响本国的政府，以便在联合国大会讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”的时候采取应有的立场，促使在联合国大会议程上撤销所谓“匈牙利问题”。
