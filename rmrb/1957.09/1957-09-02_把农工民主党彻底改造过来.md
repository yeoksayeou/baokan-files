Thoroughly Remold the China National Democratic Construction Association
China National Democratic Construction Association Central Executive Committee Member Ji Fang

The anti-Rightist struggle of the China National Democratic Construction Association, since the beginning of July, has started from the central level and gradually expanded to local organizations at all levels, exposing and criticizing the large and small Rightist groups headed by Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu and their key members, revealing their ugly faces of anti-communism and anti-socialism to the entire party and the people of the country. Thus, it has begun to reverse the party's political direction, and all party members have received profound education. It should be said that these initial achievements have been achieved first of all under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the support of the people of the whole country. However, in the two months of struggle, the Rightist elements within the party, headed by Zhang, Huang, and Li, have been dodging and trying to muddle through, and some have even been resisting stubbornly and refusing to confess. At the same time, the anti-Rightist struggle in local organizations at all levels across the country has not yet been universally and deeply developed. Therefore, how to further universally and deeply develop the anti-Rightist struggle to thoroughly expose and criticize all the Rightist elements within the party, and thoroughly remold the China National Democratic Construction Association is a serious political task before us. Whether this task can be completed, as the People's Daily editorial on August 29 pointed out, "In the current great socialist revolution struggle to criticize the bourgeois Rightists, all democratic parties are undergoing a severe historical test." We believe that this is the great Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country once again sounding the alarm for us in order to care for, cherish, and support the democratic parties.

Judging from the current situation of the anti-Rightist struggle across the country, the problem of the China National Democratic Construction Association is the most prominent and the most serious. The large and small Rightist elements, headed by the Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu Rightist groups, have not only colluded up and down within the China National Democratic Construction Association, and long held the real power of the central and most local organizations, thereby using legitimate organizations and legitimate status to pull the political and organizational lines of the China National Democratic Construction Association onto a reactionary road according to their conspiracy; Moreover, in the rampant attack of the national bourgeois Rightists, they also served as commanders and major and minor leaders, actively planning, instigating, calling for, and organizing a rampant attack on the Party, the people, and socialism. As the saying goes, "How can one get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" Therefore, as all members of the China National Democratic Construction Association who are in the tiger's den, they should have more responsibility and determination to act as warriors to destroy this tiger's den. In order to complete the task of this serious political struggle and ideological struggle, and to enable the China National Democratic Construction Association to withstand the test when passing the socialist test, we guarantee that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, we will further strengthen our position, strengthen the left-wing leading core, unite and educate the middle elements, and continue to carry out a universal and in-depth anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement within the whole party, so as to thoroughly smash the large and small Rightist elements headed by Zhang, Huang, and Li, as well as all the Rightist elements within the party, help the broad members of the party to draw a clear line between themselves and the Rightist elements, and further change their political positions. From now on, the China National Democratic Construction Association can continue to carry out reform in the process of socialist revolution, so that the party's political outlook, organizational outlook, and the ideological situation of all party members are adapted to socialism, and the party becomes a political force that loyally accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and truly serves socialism, and is transformed into a socialist party.

    把农工民主党彻底改造过来
    中国农工民主党中央执行局委员  季方
    农工民主党的反右派斗争，自7月初以来，已经从中央开始，逐渐扩大到地方各级组织，揭发、批判了以章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球为首的全党大小右派集团和他们的骨干分子，将他们反共、反社会主义的丑恶面貌暴露于全党、全国人民之前。从而开始扭转了党的政治方向，使全体党员受到了深刻的教育，应该说，这些初步成绩，首先是在中国共产党的领导和全国人民的支持下取得的。但是，在这两个月来的斗争中，以章、黄、李为首的党内右派分子，他们一直还在躲躲闪闪，企图蒙混过关，甚至有的还在抵赖顽抗，拒不交代；同时全国各级地方组织中的反右派斗争，也还没有普遍深入的展开，因此，如何进一步普遍深入地展开反右派斗争，以彻底揭发、批判党内的一切右派分子，把农工民主党彻底地改造过来，这是摆在我们面前的一个严重的政治任务。这个任务能否完成，正如8月29日人民日报的社论指出：“在当前批判资产阶级右派的伟大的社会主义革命斗争中，各民主党派正在经历着一个严重的历史考验”。我们认为，这正是伟大的中国共产党和全国人民为了关心、爱护和支持各民主党派，再一次地向我们敲起了警钟。
    从目前全国反右派斗争的情况来看，农工民主党的问题是最为突出、也最为严重的。以章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球右派集团为首的大小右派分子，他们不但在农工民主党内部上下串连，长期把持着中央和大多数地方组织的实权，从而利用合法的组织和合法的地位，把农工民主党的政治路线、组织路线，都按照他们的阴谋拉上了反动的道路；而且他们在全国资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻中，还充当了主帅和大小头目，积极策划、煽动、号召和组织向党向人民向社会主义的猖狂进攻。语云：“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”。因此，作为身居虎穴的农工民主党的全体成员来说，就应该更有责任和决心充当捣毁这个虎穴的勇士。为了完成这场严重的政治斗争和思想斗争的任务，使农工民主党在过社会主义这一关时经得起考验，我们保证在中国共产党的领导和全国人民的支持下，进一步坚定立场，加强左派领导核心，团结、教育中间分子，继续在全党范围内进行普遍深入的反右派斗争和整风运动，从而彻底粉碎以章、黄、李为首的大小右派分子以及党内的一切右派分子，帮助党内的广大成员同右派分子划清界限，进一步改变他们的政治立场，从此使农工民主党能在社会主义革命的进程中，继续不断地实行改造，使本党政治面貌、组织面貌和全体党员的思想情况与社会主义相适应，使本党成为忠诚接受共产党的领导，真正的成为为社会主义服务的政治力量，改造成为社会主义的政党。
