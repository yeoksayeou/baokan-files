    Tianjin's jointly-owned public-private Xinxing Steel Plant, based on its original dilapidated state, has undergone several small investments. After the expansion project of the steelmaking workshop is completed in November of this year, the annual steel production will reach 100,000 tons. This is a scene of steelworkers at the Xinxing Steel Plant producing next to the converter.
