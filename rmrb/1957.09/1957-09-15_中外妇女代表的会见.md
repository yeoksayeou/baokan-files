Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Women representatives from the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, who were invited to attend the Third National Women's Congress of China, met warmly with Chinese women representatives at the Beijing Hotel tonight. The women, including female workers, peasants, writers, workers in political and legal fields, and representatives of ethnic minorities, spoke freely about their work and lives.

In the women workers' meeting, representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Germany warmly met with six Chinese female workers. The German women's representative, Hese, an inspector in a rayon factory, introduced the experience of their factory's trade union in leading workers to discuss production plans and conduct labor insurance work to the Chinese female workers.

Guests from the women's delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, and North Korea warmly met with several Chinese female agricultural labor models. Leonteva, editor of the Soviet magazine "Peasant Woman," had a detailed conversation with Shen Jilan. Leonteva hoped that Shen Jilan would work hard to learn various scientific technologies and master various machines. Shen Jilan strongly agreed with her opinion. At the end of their conversation, Bulgarian representative Bulgarova and Zhao Shuzhen, vice chairman of the Hongxing Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, exchanged mailing addresses and agreed to communicate regularly in the future to exchange work experience.

Suleimanova, Minister of Justice of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, and Dolgosurong, member of the Supreme Court of Mongolia, met with six Chinese female political and legal workers. Zhang Wenxiu, Vice President of the Shanghai Higher People's Court, said that the current criminal cases in Shanghai have decreased by 82% compared with 1950, and learning from the advanced experience of Soviet legal work is of great help to improving our work. Wang Ruqi, Director of the Notary Lawyer Department of the Ministry of Justice, had visited the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in the past and met Suleimanova. They were very happy to meet again today, and she also asked Suleimanova to send her regards to her Soviet friends.

When Polish writer Zarembina had a pleasant conversation with Fang Lingru, professor of the Chinese Department of Fudan University, and writer Cao Ming, she learned in detail about the situation of Chinese writers. Zarembina was very interested in Cao Ming's experience of embarking on a creative path from middle school. She told Cao Ming that her novel "Locomotive" was being translated into Polish. Zarembina presented her recent works "Joanna's Travelogue" and "Weak People" and Gu Huasha's album as gifts to her new friends.

Women representatives from Romania and Mongolia had cordial conversations with women from ethnic minorities in our country. Dashjid, the representative of Mongolia, exchanged experiences in women's work and family life with Xue Yingma, a Mongolian representative from our country, and Wang Mo, a Tibetan representative. She also introduced that although she is already a grandmother, she still loves to ride the most fierce horses and gallop on the grassland. Elena from Romania finally sang the song "The East is Red" in Chinese with everyone.
