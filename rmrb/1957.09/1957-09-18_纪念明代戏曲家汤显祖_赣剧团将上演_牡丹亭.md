　　This year marks the 340th anniversary of the death of Tang Xianzu, a famous playwright of the Ming Dynasty in China. Literary and art circles in Jiangxi Province are actively preparing for commemorations. It is scheduled to hold a memorial meeting in Nanchang on November 12th; and from this day to around the 20th, extensive commemorative activities will be launched: the Provincial Gan Opera Troupe will perform "The Peony Pavilion" (opera troupes in other provinces and cities will also perform other works by Tang); an exhibition of materials related to Tang's life will be held; a special commemorative issue will be published; "Wang茗堂," the place where Tang studied and wrote in his hometown, will be rebuilt; Tang's tomb will be repaired; and famous performing artists from Beijing and Shanghai will be invited to Nanchang to perform Tang's famous works.
　　Tang Xianzu was a native of Linchuan, Jiangxi. In addition to the world-famous "The Peony Pavilion," his plays include "The Purple Hairpin," "The Nanke Dream," "The Handan Dream," and "The Purple Flute," among others, and countless lost works. During Tang Xianzu's lifetime, it was the golden age of Ming Dynasty opera legends, which was inseparable from Tang's hard work in creation.

　　纪念明代戏曲家汤显祖
　　赣剧团将上演“牡丹亭”
    今年是中国明代著名戏曲作家汤显祖逝世340周年，江西省文艺界正在积极筹备纪念。已预定11月12日在南昌举行纪念会；并从这一天起至20日左右，展开广泛的纪念活动：由省赣剧团演出“牡丹亭”（其它省市戏曲剧团也将演出汤氏其它著作），举办有关汤氏生平的资料展览会，出纪念特刊，重新修建当年汤氏在家乡读书和进行写作的所在“王茗堂”，修理汤氏的坟墓等，并将邀请京沪两地有名表演艺术家，来南昌演出汤氏名作。
    汤显祖是江西临川人，著作的戏曲除了有名于世的“牡丹亭”外，尚有“紫钗记”、“南柯记”、“邯郸梦”、“紫箫记”等，失传的还不计其数。在汤显祖活着的年月里，正是明代戏曲传奇的黄金时代，这与当年汤氏辛勤创作是分不开的。他在中国戏曲艺术史上，有很高的评价。
