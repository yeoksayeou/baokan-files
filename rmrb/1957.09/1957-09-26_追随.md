    A wild dog, saliva dripping, walked behind a cook, because he was carrying a large piece of fatty meat.
    "What a beautiful dinner!" the wild dog thought delightfully. But the cook held the meat high, and it couldn't reach it even when it jumped. So it gnashed its teeth and cursed.
    "Fall down! Best to fall and die!" it cursed secretly as it passed the hillside.
    "Drop it! Best to drown!" it cursed secretly as it passed the small bridge.
    However, the cook always maintained a steady pace, and the fatty meat was always held high.
    "It's simply dictatorial! Why should you be carrying the meat? Why give it to so many people to eat, but not give it to me? ... Step down!" The wild dog howled wildly with red eyes, and while the cook was brushing dust off his body, it bit him fiercely.
    Naturally, the wild dog received a sound beating, but, it is said that the wild dog actually once defended itself with such "reasons": "I have been following you wholeheartedly all along! I have closely followed you for twenty *li*..."

    一只野狗滴着唾涎，盯在一位炊事员身后走，因为他手里拎着一大块肥肉。
    “多美的晚餐呵！”野狗美美地想。但是炊事员却把肉提得高高的，它跳起来也咬不着。于是它咬牙切齿地诅咒起来。
    “摔下去吧！顶好摔死！”在经过山坡时它暗暗诅咒。
    “掉下去吧！顶好淹死！”在经过小桥时它暗暗诅咒。
    然而炊事员始终迈着稳健的步伐，肥肉始终提得高高的。
    “简直是专横！为什么肉要由你拎着？为什么要给那么多人吃，就不给我吃？……下台！”野狗红着眼睛狂吠起来，趁着炊事员拍去身上灰尘的时候，恶狠狠地咬上去。
    自然，野狗得到的是一顿痛打，不过，听说野狗居然还曾以这样的“理由”来为自己辩护：“我是一直一心一意地跟着您走的呀！我紧紧追随了您二十里……”。
