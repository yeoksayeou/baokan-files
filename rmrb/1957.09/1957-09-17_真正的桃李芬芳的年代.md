　　The Era of True Blossoming of Peach and Plum Trees
　　Liang Ruhai
    The first time I saw "Song of the Peach and Plum," I think it was twenty years ago. At that time, I was still a first-year junior high school student, completely ignorant of the true meaning of life and everything in society. Watching "Song of the Peach and Plum" seemed to be the first time it caused some confusion, some bewilderment, and some resentment towards the injustice of society. Afterwards, every time I hummed or heard:
    "Classmates, rise up, shoulder the responsibility of the nation's rise and fall..." I always remembered that initial impression. These twenty years have been spent in the storms of revolution. How many Tao Jianpings and Li Lilings have we encountered! "Song of the Peach and Plum" has been influencing young people for many years; "Graduation Song" has repeatedly awakened people's patriotic sentiments and inspired their soaring fighting spirit.
    This time, in the ninth year after liberation, during the anti-Rightist struggle, I reviewed this film again, and I have many feelings. With a very different mood from the past, I listened again to the familiar song, and together with that old principal, listened again to the experiences of Tao Jianping and Li Liling: how they walked out of the school gate with lofty ambitions, how they stepped into society with beautiful fantasies, how they experienced hardships and unemployment again and again, how one left the world in sorrow amidst poverty and illness, and the other was imprisoned for committing a crime. In the cruel gunfire, young and promising lives were murdered.
    As we watched, we couldn't help but shed tears. This is a letter of accusation filled with blood and tears on every page, accusing the old society of how it harmed and buried promising young people. At the beginning of the film, the screenwriter asked people in the guise of that news headline: "Ambitious young people, is this the result! Whose fault is it?" Whose fault is it? The film made a clear answer with life itself.
    In the old society, young people sang in vain, "Today we are the blossoming of peach and plum trees, tomorrow we will be the pillars of society." However, for those kind and upright young people like Tao Jianping who "are willing to struggle, willing to work hard, and willing to be diligent," when the right to survival is constantly threatened, when there is no way out, and even a job cannot be found, ideals can only be castles in the air that can never be reached.
    So I thought of some of the fallacies of the Rightists.
    Didn't some people slander the new society for "restricting the development of young people's individuality"? Didn't some people clamor that "talent cannot be brought into play"? The implication is that "the present is not as good as the past." Then, please ask them to watch "Song of the Peach and Plum."
    In the dark years, in the old society where the right to survival was not guaranteed for upright young people, what could be said about "developing individuality" and "giving play to talent"? If there was, it was to develop into a scheming exploiter, an accomplice who kills without blinking an eye, and a parasite who sucks the blood and sweat of the working people. Otherwise, there is no way out. Didn't Tao Jianping have a very upright, kind personality and superior talents? However, in that kind of society, how could his personality have developed normally, and how could his talents have been brought into play?
    Of course, Tao Jianping in the film does have his weaknesses. He doesn't have a clear political direction. What kind of "pillar" does he want to be, and how will his "talent" develop? Maybe even he himself is not very clear. Then, naturally, there is no way to talk about correct development. Like stagnant sewage, it can only dry up. Only today, under the brilliant sunshine, on fertile soil, can bright flowers bloom and strong fruits be produced.
    Yes, our contemporary young people are always envied by people. Such spacious classrooms, such quiet campuses, such rich and fulfilling life and learning! Even on the very first day you step into the school gate, your name is linked to the first or second Five-Year Plan of socialist construction. When you leave school, the state will arrange work for you according to your wishes and ideals. On the infinitely bright road of socialism, under the shining light of the Party, your various talents and wisdom will be brought into play. As long as you "are willing to struggle, willing to work hard, and willing to be diligent," you will surely become a pillar for building the socialist mansion.
    This is precisely the era of true blossoming of peach and plum trees that Tao Jianping and others dreamed of!
    Today, we are sending off a young comrade to work in Qinghai. He is embarking on the journey with such excitement. He is calculating the time to Lanzhou, saying that if he can't find the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee's office in Lanzhou, he will go to his alma mater—Lanzhou University—to find his old classmates. Qinghai is a strange place, but he is as happy as going back to his hometown.
    Is this something that Tao Jianping and Li Liling could have imagined? Twenty-five years ago, did they ever think that one day young people could go to new jobs so freely and carefree? This is just the most basic point, not to mention the far-reaching ideals.
    The Qaidam Basin is waving to our comrade. This is not some distant ideal, but a reality that can be touched by hand. Just as, not long ago, tens of thousands of young people who came out of school went in all directions.
    Because, this is the era of true blossoming of peach and plum trees!

### 真正的桃李芬芳的年代

　　真正的桃李芬芳的年代
　　梁汝怀
    第一次看“桃李劫”，算起来已经是二十年前的事了。那时候，我还是一个初中一年级生，对生活的真谛和社会上的一切，还是一无所知。看了“桃李劫”，好像是头一回引起一些困惑，一些迷惘，一些对社会的不平和忿恨。以后，每次自己哼起或者听到：
    同学们，大家起来，担负起天下的兴亡……的时候，总是一次次地想起这最初的印象。这二十年，是在革命的暴风雨里度过的。我们遇见到多少个陶建平和黎丽玲啊！“桃李劫”，在长长的年月里，感染着青年人；“毕业歌”一次一次地唤起人们的爱国的情操，鼓舞起人们昂扬的斗志。
    这回，在解放后的第九个年头，在反右派斗争的时候，重又温习一遍这部影片，有很多的感触。我怀着和过去迥然不同的心情，重又听一遍熟悉的歌声，重又同那位老校长一起，听一遍陶建平和黎丽玲的经历：他们怎样怀着满怀壮志走出校门，怎样怀着美丽的幻想踏进社会，怎样历尽坎坷，一次次地失业，怎样在贫病交加里，一个含愁离开人世，另一个犯罪入狱。在残酷的枪声里，年青有为的生命被杀害了。
    看着看着，我们不禁潸然泪下了。这是一册每页都充满着血泪的控诉书，控诉旧社会怎样残害和埋葬了有为的青年。影片开始，编剧者假借那则新闻标题向人们发问：“有志青年，结果如此！是谁之过？”是谁之过？影片以生活本身做了鲜明的回答。
    在旧社会里，青年们空唱着“我们今天是桃李芬芳，明天是社会的栋梁”。可是，对那些像陶建平一样“肯奋斗、肯努力、肯刻苦”的善良、正直的青年人，当生存的权利都时刻受到威胁的时候，当走头无路，连个职业都找不到的时候，理想，只能永远是可望而不可即的空中楼阁了。
    于是我想起一些右派分子的谰言。
    不是有人在那里诬蔑新社会“限制青年的个性发展”吗？不是有人在那里叫嚣“才能不能得到发挥”吗？言下之意，是“今不如昔”的。那么，请他们去看一下“桃李劫”吧。
    在黑暗的岁月里，在正直的年青人连生存的权利都得不到保证的旧社会里能谈得上什么“发展个性”、“发挥才能”呢？如果有，那就是发展成为勾心斗角的剥削者。杀人不眨眼的帮凶，和吮吸劳动人民血汗的寄生虫。否则，是没有出路的。陶建平不是有很正直的、良善的个性和优越的才能吗？然而，在那样的社会里，他的个性何曾有过正常的发展，他的才能何曾得到发挥呢？
    自然，影片里的陶建平毕竟有他的弱点，他还没有明确的政治方向。他到底要做个什么样的“栋梁”，他的“才能”又怎样发展？也许连他自己都不太清楚。那就自然谈不到正确地发展了。就像被阻塞了的臭水，只能枯涸。只有在今天，在灿烂的阳光下，在肥沃的土壤上，才能开出鲜艳的花朵，结出壮硕的果实。
    是的，我们当代的年青人，总是被人们羡慕的。这么宽敞的教室，这么幽静的校园，这么丰富、这么充实的生活和学习！甚至，在你刚踏进校门的头一天，你的名字就跟社会主义建设的第一个或第二个五年计划联系起来了。当你离开学校，国家会按照你的志愿、理想为你安排了工作。在社会主义的灿烂无极的大道上，在党的光辉的照耀下，你的各种才能和智慧都得到发挥，只要你“肯奋斗，肯努力，肯刻苦”，你也就一定能成为建设社会主义大厦的栋梁。
    这正是陶建平们梦寐以求的真正的桃李芬芳的年代啊！
    今天，我们送别一位青年的同志到青海去工作。他是那么兴奋地踏上旅程，他计算着到兰州的时间，说是如果找不到青海省委兰州办事处，就去找他的母校——兰州大学，找他的老同学。青海是个陌生的地方，但他却像回家乡去那样高兴。
    这难道又是陶建平和黎丽玲所能想像到的吗？他们在二十五年前，有没有想到有一天青年们能那么自由自在、无忧无虑地走向新的工作岗位呢？这只是最起码的一点，更不用说远大的理想了。
    柴达木盆地在我们的这位同志面前招手。这并不是什么遥远的理想，而是手触得到的现实。正如同不久以前，从学校里出来的数以万计的青年人走向四面八方一样。
    因为，这是真正的桃李芬芳的年代！
