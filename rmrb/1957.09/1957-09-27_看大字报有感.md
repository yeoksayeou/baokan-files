Thoughts on Reading Big-Character Posters
    Qin Si

    After the dark clouds, a clear sky for ten thousand miles, sunlight shining on the earth. In this season of osmanthus fragrance, the rectification movement in Beijing's factories and mines is flourishing. Big-character posters are springing up like mushrooms after rain, with great momentum. The people who read the big-character posters are shoulder to shoulder, and people's emotions often fluctuate with the content of the big-character posters, either excited or relaxed. The more they read, the more they love to read, making people feel like they are in a garden of a hundred flowers, so lingering and reluctant to leave.

    It is said that in Beijing's forty state-owned factories and mines, since the end of August, more than 140,000 big-character posters have been posted, along with more than 500,000 opinions from group meetings. Among them, about 40% are related to production technology management and Party-masses work, about 20% are related to wages, rewards, labor insurance, and welfare, about 25% are related to the work style of cadres, and about 3.7% are related to national policies and political life. Other opinions account for slightly more than 10%.

    From this, it can be clearly seen that the most opinions from the workers are in the area of production work, reaching about 40%. This shows that the broad masses of workers are most concerned about production work, and that they are wholeheartedly trying to run socialist factories and mines better and better.

    Some people may say that the opinions on wages and welfare account for 20%, which is also a lot. There should be an explanation here. First of all, it is perfectly reasonable to raise opinions in this regard, and it will be beneficial to improve work and increase production. What's more, many opinions are criticisms of unreasonable wage and welfare phenomena. Let's take a look at two examples.

    Li Delu, an old worker from the Shijingshan Power Plant, and others posted big-character posters criticizing the plant's unreasonable rewards, and pointing out that it was inappropriate to give safety rewards for weeding next to the large water pool. He questioned the leaders, why do they keep saying verbally that the rewards are rashly advancing, but actually not resolutely changing? Shao Hua of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant posted a big-character poster criticizing the plant's unreasonable rent, and he demanded that housing subsidies be canceled and rent be collected according to the unified standards of Beijing. Such opinions are too numerous to mention, what do they have in common with competing for treatment?

    Of course, the criticism of the cadres' bad work style by the workers is sharp, but they are for curing diseases and saving people, for unity, and for production. In the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, a security cadre was usually rude in his work style. During the rectification movement, people posted big-character posters criticizing him severely. This person accepted everyone's opinions and made a relatively profound self-criticism at the meeting. When the meeting adjourned, everyone laughed heartily and made up.

    Are there no bad opinions in factories and mines? Of course not, but the quantity is very small, only accounting for five per thousand of all opinions. Although not completely absent, it is only a few.

    What do we see from here? Isn't it once again proving that the working class has a high degree of consciousness and a high degree of responsibility for the socialist cause? Isn't it once again proving that they are fully worthy of being the leading class of our country? Therefore, reading big-character posters itself is a practical education for us.

    看大字报有感
    秦思
    黑云过后，万里晴空，阳光普照着大地。在这桂子飘香的季节，北京各厂矿企业蓬勃地展开了整风运动。大字报如雨后春笋，声势浩大。看大字报的人摩肩接踵，人们的情感常常随着大字报的内容或激动或轻松，越看越爱看，使人如入百花园中，竟至留连忘返。
    据说北京四十个国营厂矿从8月下旬开始，到现在共贴出大字报十四万多张，连同小组会上的意见共五十多万条。其中有关生产技术管理工作、党群工作的意见占40％左右，有关工资奖励劳保福利的意见占20％左右，有关干部作风的意见占25％左右，有关国家政策和政治生活的意见占3.7％。其他方面的意见占10％强。
    从这里一眼可以看出，职工群众意见最多的是在生产工作方面，高达40％左右。这说明广大职工群众最关心的是生产工作，说明他们是一心一意要把社会主义厂矿企业办得好上加好。
    有人会说，关于工资福利方面的意见占20％，也不少呀。这里应有个说明。首先是在这方面有意见，提出来完全应该，提得对，对改进工作提高生产都会有好处。何况，许多意见都是批评工资福利不合理现象的。不妨举两个例子看一看。
    石景山发电厂老工人李德禄等贴出了大字报，批评厂子里的奖励不合理，指责在大水池旁拔草也给安全奖励是不妥当。他质问领导，为什么口头上老说奖励冒进了，实际上不坚决改？石景山钢铁厂邵华贴出一张大字报，批评厂子房租不合理，他要求取消房贴，按北京市的统一标准收房租。这样的意见，举不胜举，这与争待遇有什么共同之处呢？
    当然，职工群众对干部的不良作风批评是尖锐的，但是，他们是为治病救人，为了团结，为了生产。北京电业局有一个保卫干部，平日作风粗暴，整风中人们给他贴出了大字报，严厉地批评了他。这个人接受大家意见，在会上检讨得比较深刻，散会时大家哈哈大笑，言归于好。
    在厂矿企业中是否就没有坏的意见了呢？当然不是，但是数量微乎其微，只占全部意见的千分之五，虽非绝无，也是仅有了。
    由这里我们看到什么呢？难道不是又一次证明工人阶级有高度的觉悟，对社会主义事业有高度的责任心吗？不是又一次证明他们完全称得起是我们国家的领导阶级吗？所以，看大字报的本身对我们就是一个实际的教育。
