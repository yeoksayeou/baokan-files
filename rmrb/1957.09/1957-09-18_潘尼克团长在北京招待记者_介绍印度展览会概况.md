Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Indian Exhibition delegation held a press conference today. More than 60 Chinese and foreign journalists attended the press conference.

The head of the Exhibition delegation, Panikkar, said at the press conference: The main purpose of this exhibition is to promote the development of trade and friendly relations between China and India.

Panikkar said that this is the first time the Indian government has held an exhibition of this form and scale in the People's Republic of China. He said: "We hope that this exhibition will enable the Chinese people to have some understanding of the general situation of India in industry and other aspects in the past ten years since independence."

When introducing the general situation of the exhibition, Panikkar said that this comprehensive exhibition is divided into three pavilions: industrial products, textiles, and handicrafts, with a total of more than 48,000 exhibits. 299 units from India participated in this exhibition, of which 266 are private industrial enterprises, and the rest are state-owned, state government-operated, and other publicly-owned enterprises. Panikkar said: "Due to the limitations of time, transportation and other conditions, this exhibition has not been as fully representative as we originally hoped it would be."

　　潘尼克团长在北京招待记者
　　介绍印度展览会概况
    新华社17日讯　印度展览会代表团今天举行记者招待会，出席招待会的中外记者共六十多人。
    展览会代表团团长潘尼克在记者招待会上说：这个展览会主要的目的是为了促进中印两国的贸易和友好关系的发展。
    潘尼克说，印度政府在中华人民共和国举行这样一个形式和规模的展览会，还是第一次。他说：“我们希望这个展览会将能使中国人民对印度自从获得独立以来的过去十年中在工业和其他方面的概况有所了解。”
    潘尼克介绍展览会的概况时说，这个综合展览会分工业品、纺织品、手工艺品三个馆，共有展品四万八千多件。参加这个展览会的有印度二百九十九个单位，其中有二百六十六个是私营工业企业，其余的是印度国营、邦政府经营和其他公营的企业。潘尼克说：“由于时间、运输等条件的限制，这个展览会未能具有我们原来期望它所具有的充分代表性。”
