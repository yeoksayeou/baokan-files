    A student joined the Communist Youth League and took on important work within the League's general branch. After returning home, he told his capitalist father about this.
    Logically, this is a good thing. Taking on work in the League's general branch signifies the student's progress and the organization's trust in him. But this capitalist had a different view. He rebuked his son like this: "Don't focus on these things instead of studying hard! Look, on the street, there are people riding in cars and people driving cars. Would you rather ride in a car to socialism, or drive a car to socialism?"
    It's not surprising that a capitalist would have this kind of thinking. However, this kind of thinking isn't only reflected in one or two parents.
    Recently, a large number of young students in Beijing responded to the state's call and went to the countryside. They are determined to be the first generation of cultured farmers, contributing their bit through labor during the first Five-Year Plan, which is a good thing. But it has met with resistance from some parents.
    It can't be said that every student has completely clear thinking, and mobilizing them to participate in agricultural production isn't without its obstacles. But young people are, after all, pure and enthusiastic. As long as the reasoning is clear and their enthusiasm is stirred, they are happy to participate in manual labor. At this time, the attitude of parents often plays a decisive role. This year, it happened that a student asked his homeroom teacher to go to his home to mobilize his parents, to get them to allow him to participate in agricultural production. For these parents, it is a bit of a disservice to their children.
    However, when teachers pay a visit, they may encounter some unpleasant scenes.
    A typical conversation goes like this: Before the teacher can explain their purpose, the parent opens by complimenting the teacher's conscientiousness and responsibility, then speaks at length about the government's call, points out the glory of participating in labor, and expresses their full support, seeming even more enlightened than the teacher. But don't be happy yet, because the topic then shifts: "If the child doesn't get into school, participating in manual labor is a correct and bright path, and I agree. But his mother just can't understand, she can't bear to let him go, and I can't force her." Originally, the child belongs to both of them, and "his mother" always has a say in the matter, and the so-called "his mother" is a housewife. So it's not so strange that she "can't understand and can't bear to let him go." These words are both high-sounding and irresponsible, giving the well-intentioned teacher a feeling of sympathy on top of admiration. What a good idea. Compared to avoiding the teacher altogether and letting "his mother" take the lead, this seems a bit more clever. But is it really clever?
    The future world belongs to young people, and in the end, young people will choose their own path. The son of a certain capitalist is a previous example. In our society, labor will always be a glorious and heroic undertaking. It's best not to hinder the progress of our children. No one can live their whole life under the care of their parents. Seedlings in a greenhouse must eventually be planted in the fields to blossom and bear fruit. Don't harm your children because you love them. That would truly let down our younger generation.

    不要愧对子弟
    张锦明
    一个学生入了团，而且担任了团总支的重要工作，回家之后把这件事告诉给资本家的父亲。
    按理说这是一件好事情，担任了团总支工作标志着学生本人的进步和组织对他的信任。但是这位资本家却另有看法。这样训斥他的儿子：“不好好念书，搞这些干什么？你看大街上有坐汽车的，也有开汽车的。你愿意坐汽车到社会主义呢，还是愿意开汽车到社会主义呢？”
    资本家有这种思想是不足奇怪的了。然而这种思想却不只是反映在一两个家长身上。
    最近北京有大批青年学生响应国家的号召走向农村去了。他们决心作第一代有文化的农民。在第一个五年中就以自己的劳动作出点滴的贡献，这是一件好事情。但是却在一些家长中遇到了阻力。
    学生本身不能说个个思想都很通，动员他们去参加农业生产也不是没有阻力。但青年毕竟是纯洁而又热情，只要讲清道理，激起热情，他们是乐于去参加体力劳动的。这时家长的态度往往起决定性的作用。今年就发生过这样事情，学生要求班主任老师到他家去动员他的家长，要他家长准许他去参加农业生产。对这些家长来说，真有点愧对自己的子弟了。
    然而，当老师登门拜访的时候，也会遇到一些不愉快的镜头。
    一般谈话是这样的，不等老师说明来意，就先开门见山，恭维老师的认真负责，接着就大讲政府的号召，指明参加劳动的光荣，表示自己的全力支持，简直比老师要明白得多。但且慢高兴，接着话题一转“孩子没考上学校，去参加体力劳动是一条正确光明的道路，我是同意的；不过他妈总搞不通，舍不得，我也不好勉强”。本来孩子是两个人的，“他妈”总对这个问题有发言权，而所谓“他妈”又是家庭妇女。“搞不通，舍不得”就不足深怪了。这样话既冠冕堂皇又不负责任，使好心教师于钦佩之余，还有同情之感。真是好主意。比起自己避而不见，却专使“他妈”出面的似乎更高明了一些。但是真的高明吗？
    未来的世界是属于青年人的，最后青年人会选择他们自己要走的路。某资本家的儿子就是前例。在我们的社会里，劳动将永远是光荣豪迈的事业。还是不要牵扯儿女的进步吧。没有人能在父母的抚育下过一辈子。温室中的种苗终于要培置在田野上才能开花结果，不要因为爱儿女而害了儿女。那样就真的愧对子弟了。
