Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 20th: The United Nations General Assembly General Committee, under the manipulation of the United States, refused on the 19th to include the "China Representation Issue" on the General Assembly agenda. This issue was suggested by India for inclusion on the agenda.

    Indian representative Menon, speaking at the General Committee meeting, once again requested that this issue be included on the General Assembly agenda. He said that the United Nations General Assembly has an obligation to discuss this issue because considering it is conducive to establishing world peace and cooperation. Refusing to include this issue on the General Assembly agenda is unwise and does not comply with the rules of the United Nations.

    Soviet representative Kuznetzov supported India's suggestion. He said that the United Nations General Assembly must recognize the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China. Refusing to recognize China's legitimate representatives is absurd, arbitrary, and unjust.

    The Czechoslovakian representative said that without the participation of the Chinese people, the United Nations would certainly not be able to resolve any issues related to the Far East.

    The Ceylonese representative, Gunawardene, said that his government supports including India's suggestion on the General Assembly agenda.

    U.S. representative Lodge opposed including India's suggestion on the General Assembly agenda. He put forward a proposal requesting the Assembly to decide to reject India's suggestion and to decide that the current Assembly would not consider any suggestions requiring the exclusion of Kuomintang elements or "seeking the representation of the People's Republic of China (in the United Nations)." The U.S. proposal was supported by representatives from the United Kingdom, Thailand, Kuomintang elements, and Iran.

    The meeting then, under the manipulation of the United States, violated the rules of procedure and first voted on the U.S. proposal. The voting result was nine in favor, four against, and two abstentions. Voting in favor were the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Paraguay, Iran, Thailand, the Netherlands, Venezuela, and Kuomintang elements. Voting against were the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Norway, and Ceylon. Guatemala and Tunisia abstained. Guatemalan representative Catalan said that although his government does not recognize the government of the People's Republic of China, he does not believe that the U.S. proposal to refuse discussion of China's representation is legally sound. Therefore, he abstained when voting on the U.S. proposal.

    After the vote, Soviet representative Kuznetzov stated that the Soviet Union could not agree to the committee's decision and reserved the right to speak on this issue in the General Assembly and elsewhere.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 20th: The United Nations General Assembly General Committee decided on the 19th to include the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the General Assembly agenda.

    During the discussion, Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath protested against further discussion of this issue by the United Nations. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetzov opposed including this issue on the General Assembly agenda.

    美国操纵联大总务委员会否决印度提案
    我国代表权问题竟未被列入议程
    西方国家硬迫大会讨论“匈牙利问题”
    据新华社20日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会19日在美国的操纵下，拒绝把“中国代表权问题”列入大会议程。这个问题是印度建议列入议程的。
    印度代表梅农在总务委员会会议上发言时再一次要求把这个问题列入大会议程。他说，联合国大会有义务讨论这个问题，因为考虑这个问题有助于建立世界的和平和合作。拒绝把这个问题列入大会议程是不智的和不合乎联合国的规则的。
    苏联代表库兹?佐夫支持印度的建议。他说，联合国大会必须承认中华人民共和国的合法权利。拒绝承认中国的合法代表是荒谬的、专断的和不公正的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表说，要是没有中国人民参加，联合国当然也就不可能解决有关远东的任何问题。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼说，他的政府支持把印度建议列入大会议程。
    美国代表洛奇反对把印度的建议列入大会议程。他提出一个提案，要求大会决定拒绝印度的建议，并且决定本届大会不考虑任何要求排斥国民党分子或者“谋求中华人民共和国（在联合国中）的代表权”的建议。美国这个提案得到英国、泰国、国民党分子、伊朗的代表的支持。
    会议接着在美国的操纵下违反议事规程，先就美国的提案进行表决。表决结果，九票赞成、四票反对、两票弃权。投赞成票的是美国、英国、法国、巴拉圭、伊朗、泰国、荷兰、委内瑞拉和国民党分子。投反对票的是苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、挪威和锡兰。危地马拉和突尼斯弃权。危地马拉代表卡塔兰说，他的政府虽然不承认中华人民共和国政府，但是他并不认为美国拒绝讨论中国代表权的提案在法律上是健全的。因此他在表决美国的提案时弃权。
    在投票后，苏联代表库兹?佐夫发言说，苏联不能够同意委员会的决定，它保留就这个问题在大会上和其他地方发言的权利。
    据新华社20日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会19日决定把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入大会议程。
    在讨论中，匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特抗议联合国进一步讨论这个问题。苏联外交部副部长库兹?佐夫反对把这个问题列入大会议程。
