Going Deep into Reality, Experiencing Life
　　Vietnamese Writers and Artists Go Down to Factories and the Countryside
    Hanoi Dispatch: Writers, playwrights, painters, and musicians of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are working hard to go deep into factories, the countryside, and the army to experience life and collect materials to create works reflecting various stages of the revolution and the current work of recovery and construction.
    Nguyen Dinh Thi, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Federation of Literary and Art Associations, said that the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, in order to promote creative work, are actively helping artists solve various practical difficulties and providing them with relatively smooth working conditions. For example, a system has been established so that all artists with administrative positions have at least three months each year away from office life to freely go down to factories, the countryside, or the army to experience life or create. For example, the government helps various literary and art associations establish "funds," and all full-time artists or literary and art workers who are determined to go deep into reality and the masses can apply for loans from their associations, which will be repaid after obtaining royalties or copyright fees. In order to ensure the lives of artists and the large-scale publication of works, the Ministry of Culture of the government has promulgated regulations on copyright and royalties, and is in the process of building a new art publishing institution including color printing and record production.
    With the support and encouragement of the Party and the government, the creative enthusiasm of many professional artists and non-professional literary and art workers has been greatly increased. The old writer To Hoai is experiencing life in the coastal countryside of Thanh Hoa Province, and he is preparing to create a huge work depicting the entire transformation process of the Vietnamese countryside; the famous poet Tran Huu Thong and literary critic and writer Hoang Trung Thong have returned to the Fourth Interzone to collect materials on the Nghe An Soviet movement of 1930, preparing to create poems and novels reflecting this great revolutionary period; writer Nguyen Huy Tuong and playwright Nguyen Xuan Khac are writing novels and operas based on the heroes of the Capital Defense War in the early days of the Anti-French War in 1946; writer Ha Minh Tuan's novel "Hanoi in My Heart" describing the "August Revolution" period will be published soon. In addition, the Musicians Association and the Artists Association have organized more than 40 musicians and more than 100 painters and sculptors to go down to factories, the countryside, and the army to experience life and create works reflecting workers, peasants, and soldiers, reflecting real life.

　　深入实际　体验生活
　　越南文艺工作者下厂下乡
    本报河内航讯　越南民主共和国的作家、戏剧家、画家和音乐家们，正努力深入工厂、农村和部队，去体验生活和搜集材料，创作反映各个革命阶段和当前恢复建设工作的作品。
    越南文艺界联合会秘书长、诗人阮?诗说，越南劳动党和政府为了繁荣创作，积极帮助文艺家们解决各种实际困难，给他们提供了比较顺利的工作条件。例如建立一种制度，使所有兼有行政职务的艺术家，每年至少有三个月脱离机关生活，自由地下厂、下乡或下部队去体验生活或进行创作。又例如政府帮助各种文艺协会建立“钱柜”，凡有志深入实际、深入群众的脱产艺术家或文艺工作者，都可以向所属协会贷款，待取得稿费或版权费后再归还。为了使文艺家的生活得到保障和作品能够大量出版，政府文化部已颁布了一项关于版权、稿费的规定，并且正在着手建设一座包括彩色印刷和制作唱片的新的艺术出版机构。
    在党和政府的支持和鼓励下，许多职业文艺家和非职业文艺工作者的创作热情大大地提高了。老作家苏怀正在清化省滨海农村体验生活，他准备创作一部描绘越南农村整个变革过程的巨大作品；名诗人陈友通、文艺批评家兼作家黄忠通已经回到第四联区去，他们要搜集1930年义安苏维埃运动的材料，准备创作反映这个伟大革命时期的诗篇和小说；作家阮辉想、戏剧家阮春括正在以1946年抗战初期首都保卫战的英雄们为题材，写小说和歌剧；作家何明遵描写“八月革命”时期的小说“河内心中”不久即将出版。此外，音乐家协会、美术家协会已经组织了四十多名音乐家和一百多名画家、雕塑家下厂、下乡、下部队去体验生活，创作反映工、农、兵，反映现实生活的作品。
