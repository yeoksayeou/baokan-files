    The deep bond between workers and peasants is as profound as the sea, neither can do without the other." This is a common sentiment expressed by members of the Wusi Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, after recently discussing the importance of the worker-peasant alliance.

    Some time ago, some cadres and members of the Wusi Agricultural Cooperative did not fully recognize the importance of the worker-peasant alliance, and put forward many erroneous opinions on worker-peasant relations. Many members did not acknowledge industrial support for agriculture, saying, "Our cooperative has increased grain and cotton production in recent years and sold a lot to the state, but we haven't seen machines coming to the fields." "Without industry, the fields still produce grain." Some members also said that the Communist Party was acting with "favoritism, workers have a good life, and peasants have a hard life." As a result, the number of people who were not content with agricultural production and wanted to go to the city to become workers increased day by day. In order to enable the members to have a correct understanding of this issue, the CCP branch of the cooperative led the members in launching a major debate.

    At the debate, the members fully explained the reasoning, made detailed calculations, and distinguished between right and wrong. At the meeting, many people refuted the erroneous idea that "industry does not support agriculture" with specific facts. They pointed out that in June this year, when the early rice was filling out, the middle rice was flowering, and the single-season late rice was sprouting, it did not rain for twenty-eight consecutive days. More than 450 mu of paddy fields in Beifan, which had no pond water for irrigation, were completely dry. Water from the Che River required dozens of waterwheels, and time was running out. Seeing that production was about to be reduced, the members were extremely anxious. At this critical moment, the government provided a loan of 4,000 yuan to buy a 25-horsepower water pump, which pumped water day and night. A worker worked with the water pump for three days and three nights, and all the drought-stricken paddy fields were irrigated. Calculating the accounts, this one item alone would bring in more than 120,000 jin of grain for the whole cooperative, with some remaining after repaying the government loan. Other members explained the state's supply of pesticides and agricultural machinery as industrial support for agriculture. This year, the whole cooperative used more than 1,000 jin of various pesticides, 25 pieces of agricultural machinery of various sizes, and more than 8,000 jin of chemical fertilizers, which guaranteed the high yield of more than 1,000 jin of rice per mu and the overall harvest of cotton, soybeans, and peanuts. The cooperative's good spring wheat harvest, with an average yield of 309 jin per mu, was also due to the state's supply of ten-row drills and double-shared plows. After calculating the big picture, the members cheered in unison. Luo Hongguo said, "Water has a source and trees have roots. Developing industry is good news. Without industrialization, large-scale increases in agricultural production are impossible." The members who originally thought that industry did not support agriculture had nothing to say after hearing these facts.

    Next, the focus of the discussion shifted to whether the lives of peasants were harder than those of workers, and whether the Communist Party treated workers and peasants with favoritism. A member of the fifth team first said, "If you don't believe us, let's switch shifts and ask those workers to farm the land and taste the bitterness of peasant life!" Some other members also said that the prices of industrial products such as salt and cloth were too expensive, while the price of grain had fallen. These erroneous arguments were immediately refuted by the vast majority of members. Member Zhang Guoshan said, "I worked as a long-term farmhand for landlords for decades. After liberation, I was emancipated by the land reform and joined the cooperative. I have enough to eat and wear, and I still have more than 300 yuan in savings in the bank. Is such a life still bitter?" The Party branch also helped everyone calculate a comparative account of living standards: Before liberation, 60% of the cooperative's farming households worried about the next meal after eating the current one, and 20% were short of three to five months' worth of food every year. But since the cooperative was established, it has become stronger year by year. Now, most households have become surplus grain households. Last year, each person in the whole cooperative received an average of 586 jin of grain for food alone. The days when peasants lacked food to eat for thousands of years are gone forever. After comparing the situation before and after, everyone felt that their lives had improved. Member Luo Jiazhai said that not only was life good, but culture had also undergone a great change. Before liberation, only 13 people out of 301 in the whole village were literate, but now 187 people are literate. Some members also pointed out that the large difference between the prices of daily-use industrial products and agricultural products was not true. Kerosene, salt, and other items are cheaper than in the past, and the prices of agricultural products such as pork and oil are higher than in the past. As for the increased prices of commodities such as silk, wool, and high-grade cigarettes and alcohol, they have little impact on peasants.

    After everyone clarified the gradual improvement of peasants' lives, they further realized that it was right for workers' lives to improve as well. Members Luo Xinxuan and Luo Yongmo said: The number of workers who can earn one hundred and eighty yuan a month is small, and it is reasonable to get more, because workers create greater value.

    Moreover, workers are different from peasants. They live in cities and have a higher standard of living. They have no fields or land, and they have to pay for everything they buy.

    After such a discussion, the members who had made erroneous arguments were silent, and some members consciously examined their own wrong understandings. Upper-middle peasant Luo Yixin said, "When I joined the cooperative, I said that as long as I had enough to eat and didn't have to worry about clothes, I would do whatever I was told. Now that I have enough to eat and wear, if something in the cooperative is not done to my liking, I say it has no advantages. This is capitalism at work." The members who had clamored to go to the city to become workers also abandoned their plans and expressed their willingness to concentrate on agricultural production.

    Now the members are happier than before, and the scene of a bumper harvest in the fields adds to their joy. They have expressed their determination to improve production, increase grain, and support national industrialization. Recently, the cooperative has planned to increase grain production by another 140,000 jin. In order to achieve this production increase plan, the members have applied the third topdressing fertilizer to 712 mu of single-season late rice fields, and 90% of the members participate in production every day. In addition, the members also decided to sell 200,000 jin of the 280,000 jin of early rice harvested this year to the state, in addition to reserving enough seeds, fodder, and food for the members, and to save grain and sell another 20,000 jin of wheat to the state.

    工农情深似海
    ——记孝感县五四农业社工农联盟问题的讨论
    “工农情深似海，谁也离不了谁”，这是湖北省孝感县五四农业社社员最近讨论了工农联盟的重要性这个问题以后，普遍反映的一句话。
    前些时，五四农业社有些干部和社员对工农联盟的重要性认识不足，在工农关系上提出不少错误意见，还有不少社员不承认工业支援农业，说“这几年我们合作社粮食、棉花增产了，卖给国家很多，就没看见机器下田庄”。“没有工业，田地还是收粮食”。还有些社员说共产党办事“厚此薄彼，工人生活好，农民生活苦”。不安心农业生产而想进城当工人的人，因此一天天多起来。这个社的中共支部为了使社员对这个问题有正确的认识，于是领导社员展开了一场大辩论。
    在辩论会上，社员们充分地说道理，算细账，辨明是非。会上，很多人以具体事实驳斥了“工业没有支援农业”的错误思想。他们指出，今年6月间，当早稻正灌浆，中稻在扬花吐穗，一季晚粳正在发蔸的时候，一连二十八天不下雨，北畈四百五十多亩无塘水灌溉的稻田，全部干旱了，车河水需要几十乘水车，时间赶不上，眼看着要减产，社员们焦急万分。就在这个火口上政府贷款四千元，买回一部二十五匹马力的抽水机，日夜抽水，一位工人随着抽水机工作了三天三晚，把受旱稻田全部灌满了水，算算账，仅这一项全社可多收入十二万多斤谷子，除了归还政府贷款以外，还有剩余。还有社员从国家供应农药和农械方面说明工业对农业的支援。今年全社用了各种农药一千多斤，大小农械二十五部，化学肥料八千多斤，这些对水稻千斤丰产和棉花、黄豆和花生的全面丰收起了保证作用。社里春季小麦收成好，每亩平均产三百零九斤，也是多亏国家供应十行条播机和双铧犁才得到的。把大账一算，社员齐声叫好，罗宏国说：“水有源来树有根，发展工业是福音，农业离开了工业化，大量增产不可能。”原来认为工业对农业没有什么支援的社员，听了这些事实，也都无言可答。
    接着，讨论的焦点集中到农民的生活同工人比较到底苦不苦，共产党对待工人和农民是不是厚此薄彼的问题。第五队一个社员首先说：“不信我们换个班，叫那些工人来种田，尝尝农民生活苦不苦！”另外有些社员也说食盐、布匹等工业品的价钱太贵，粮食反而跌了价。这些错误的论调立刻遭到绝大多数社员的反驳。社员张国山说：“我过去给地主当几十年长工，解放后土改翻了身，又加入了合作社，有吃有穿，在银行里还存款三百多元，这样的生活还要叫苦吗？”党支部也帮助大家算了一笔生活对比账：社里的农户解放前有60％吃了上顿愁下顿，有20％年年要缺三、五个月的口粮，可是自从办了合作社，就一年比一年强，到现在大多数户都变成了余粮户，去年全社每人光口粮平均就分到五百八十六斤，农民几千年来缺粮吃的日子一去不复返了。这样前后一对比，大家都感到生活提高了。社员罗家榨说，不仅生活过得好，文化也翻了身，解放以前全湾三百零一人，只有十三人识字，现在识字的有一百八十七人了。还有社员指出，日用工业品和农产品贵贱差别大，不符合事实。煤油、食盐等都比过去便宜，现在农产品如猪肉、油料等价格都比过去高；至于绸缎、呢绒和高级纸烟、酒等商品的价格提高点，对农民关系不大。
    大家明确了农民生活逐步改善的情况后，又进一步认识到工人生活有所提高也是应该的。社员罗信轩、罗用谟说：工人一月能赚百来八十元的人是少数，就是多拿点也合理，因为工人创造的价值大。
    再说，工人不比农民，住在城市生活水平高，没田没地，不管什么东西都要掏钱买。
    经过这样讨论，原来有错误论调的社员都悄然无声，有些社员自觉地检查了自己的错误认识。上中农罗仪信说：“入社时说，只要奔得有饭吃，不愁穿，叫我怎样就怎样。现在吃穿都不愁了，社里的事有一点做得不如意，就说没有优越性，这就是资本主义思想在作怪。”原来叫嚷要到城里去当工人的社员，也都放弃了打算，表示安心农业生产。
    现在社员们的心情比过去更加愉快，田野里一片丰收景象更给社员们增添了欢乐。他们纷纷表示：必须搞好生产，增加粮食，支援国家工业化。最近，社里计划再增产十四万斤粮食，为了实现这个增产计划，社员们已经在七百一十二亩一季晚粳稻田里施了第三次追肥，每天有90％的社员参加生产。此外，社员们还决定把今年收获的二十八万斤早稻，除留足种籽、饲料和社员的口粮以外，卖给国家二十万斤，并要节约粮食，再卖二万斤小麦给国家。
