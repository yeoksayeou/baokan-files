Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 22nd: The rectification movement centered on the anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai's democratic parties has gradually developed from the municipal leadership organs to the grassroots level. The district-level rectification leadership organizations of the various democratic parties have been established, and some grassroots organizations have begun to expose and criticize Rightists.

Recently, Shanghai's democratic parties have convened member representative meetings or expanded cadre meetings to discuss the issue of promoting the movement to the grassroots level. These meetings emphasized that when carrying out the rectification movement centered on the anti-Rightist struggle, grassroots organizations of democratic parties must strive for the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party organizations in their respective districts and units. At the same time, in the struggle, they must implement the spirit of presenting facts and reasoning to ensure that the broad masses of members receive a profound socialist education. These meetings also conducted criticism and self-criticism of various erroneous thoughts that hindered the development of the movement, such as the "family scandal should not be made public," as well as leniency and the attitude of staying out of things. Some members also made sharp criticisms of the right-leaning performance of the municipal rectification leadership organs of their parties in the anti-Rightist struggle.

According to preliminary materials revealed, there are also significant problems in the district-level leadership organizations and grassroots organizations of Shanghai's democratic parties. Among the eighteen district organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) in Shanghai, at least seven district committee chairmen or vice-chairmen have been found to be Rightists. The situation among the responsible persons of the district-level organizations of the China Democratic Party is similarly serious. Among the sixty-five members of the existing fourteen districts, thirteen Rightists have been preliminarily identified, including six chairmen. In the grassroots organizations of other democratic parties, there are also many Rightists or even manipulation by Rightists, resulting in political chaos during the period of great airing of views, and some even degenerated into tools for Rightist groups and Rightists to oppose the Communist Party and socialism.

    上海各民主党派基层组织问题严重
    反右派斗争逐步发展到基层
    据新华社上海22日电　上海市各民主党派以反右派斗争为中心的整风运动，已由市级领导机关逐步发展到基层。各民主党派的区级整风领导机构已经建立起来，一部分基层组织已经开始揭露和批判右派分子。
  最近上海各民主党派都召开成员代表会议或干部扩大会议，讨论把运动推向基层的问题。这些会议都强调：各民主党派基层组织在开展以反右派斗争为中心的整风运动时，一定要争取所在地区和所在单位共产党组织的领导和帮助，同时在斗争中必须贯彻摆事实、讲道理的精神，使广大成员人人受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。这些会议还就民主党派成员中存在的“家丑不可外扬”以及温情主义、置身事外等妨碍运动开展的各种错误思想进行了批评与自我批评。有些成员对自己党派的市级整风领导机构在反右派斗争中的右倾表现也提出了尖锐的批评。
    据初步揭露出来的材料说明，上海各民主党派的区级领导机构和基层组织中问题也不小。民革上海市的十八个地区组织中已发现至少有七个地区的区委正主任委员或副主任委员是右派分子。农工民主党区级组织负责人中的情况同样严重，在现有十四个区的六十五名委员中，已初步发现有十三个右派分子，其中主任委员有六人。其他民主党派的基层组织中，也有不少有右派分子甚至被右派分子操纵，以致在大鸣大放中一度发生政治上的混乱，有的甚至沦为右派集团和右派分子反共反社会主义的工具。
