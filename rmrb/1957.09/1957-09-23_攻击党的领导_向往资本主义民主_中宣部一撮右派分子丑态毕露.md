Attacking the Party Leadership, Yearning for Capitalist Democracy
The Ugly Features of a Handful of Rightists in the Central Propaganda Department Fully Exposed

(Our report) Since July, the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China has been conducting a thorough anti-Rightist struggle. Currently, the exposed Rightists include: Ma Jiaju, Xi Xin, Yu Kangjin (Party member), Chen Bu, Hou Depeng (Party member), and Zeng Xianfa (Youth League member). Chen Bu, Hou Depeng, and Zeng Xianfa also formed an anti-Party clique, closely contacting Rightists from certain universities, institutions, and organizations, plotting anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities.

The targets of these Rightists' attacks were primarily the Party leadership and Party cadres. Yu Kangjin depicted the entire Party in an ugly light as a “feudal exploitative group that oppresses those below, is flattered by those below, benefits first, and suffers last,” “disregards the suffering of the people,” and is “steadily establishing a feudal hierarchical system.” Ma Jiaju slandered veteran cadres as a group of selfish, hypocritical, autocratic, and foolish people. Xi Xin accused the Party of being filled with the “stench of feudal morality,” where “fathers conceal for their sons, and sons conceal for their fathers.” He advocated abolishing the Party's leadership over government work. Hou Depeng believed that the Party's leadership "hindered the development of science" and advocated handing over scientific endeavors entirely to bourgeois scientists. These Rightists spread rumors that the Party "only busy with transforming others, not paying attention to transforming itself." Zeng Xianfa vilified our capital as the "upper class society of St. Petersburg" during the era of the fatuous, corrupt, and dark Tsarist Russia, and declared that he would "throw a bomb" at this society.

These Rightists yearned greatly for bourgeois democracy. They all slandered our socialist system as undemocratic, and regretted that our country had entered socialism without going through a "stage of capitalist democratic development." They advocated that socialism should absorb the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of capitalist society. Yu Kangjin even more wildly demanded to "make up one's mind, and take revolutionary measures to change" the people's democratic dictatorship system.

They also did their utmost to slander the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. Chen Bu openly clamored that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "violating the constitution, infringing on human rights," and that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "suppressing the masses," and so on.

These Rightists' anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments have deep historical and ideological roots. Ma Jiaju came from a family of traitorous officials, and had joined the Kuomintang and the Youth Party. Xi Xin came from a landlord family, was a member of the Japanese puppet New People's Society, and actively praised Chiang Kai-shek after the Japanese surrendered. Yu Kangjin originally came from a poor peasant family. After liberation, his family rose to become a wealthy middle peasant. His bourgeois extreme individualism, combined with the capitalist ideas of his wealthy middle peasant family, led him to betray the Party and embark on an anti-Party and anti-socialist path. Zeng Xianfa, Chen Bu, and Hou Depeng came from bourgeois or liberal professional families. They all had serious bourgeois individualistic thoughts, lived a decadent life, their thoughts were degenerate, and they hated the Party and disliked the socialist system because their personal desires were not satisfied.

### 攻击党的领导　向往资本主义民主  中宣部一撮右派分子丑态毕露

    攻击党的领导　向往资本主义民主
    中宣部一撮右派分子丑态毕露
    本报讯　中共中央宣传部机关从7月份以来深入地开展了反右派斗争。目前，已被揭露出来的右派分子有：马家驹、席炘、俞康金（党员）、陈步、侯德彭（党员）、曾宪法（团员）。陈步、侯德彭和曾宪法还结成一个反党小集团，同某些高等学校、机关、团体的一些右派分子密切接触，策划反共反社会主义的活动。
    这些右派分子攻击的对象，首先是党的领导和党员干部。俞康金把全党丑化为“上级欺压，下级吹捧，得利在先，吃苦在后”，“置人民痛苦于不顾”“的维护私利的封建剥削集团”，并诬蔑党是在“步步紧地在建立”“封建等级制度”。马家驹诽谤老干部是一群自私、虚伪、专横、愚蠢的人。席炘诬蔑党充满了“封建道德霉味”，“父为子隐，子为父隐”。他主张取消党对政府工作的领导。侯德彭则认为党的领导“妨碍了科学的发展”，主张把科学事业完全交给资产阶级科学家去管。这些右派分子造谣说党“只忙于改造别人，不注意改造自己”。曾宪法把我们的首都污蔑为昏庸、腐朽、黑暗的帝俄时代的“彼得堡上流社会”，并声言要向这个社会“投进一颗炸弹”。
    这些右派分子，对于资产阶级民主十分向往。他们都诬蔑我国的社会主义制度不民主，都以我国没有经过“资本主义民主的发展阶段”就进入社会主义为憾，主张社会主义要吸收资本主义社会的所谓“民主”和“自由”。俞康金更猖狂地要“痛下决心，采取革命的办法改变”人民民主专政制度。
    对于肃反运动，他们也极尽诬蔑之能事。陈步公开叫嚣肃反“违反宪法，侵犯人权”，肃反是“肃群众”等。
    这些右派分子反党、反社会主义是有深远的历史根源和思想根源的。马家驹出身于汉奸官僚家庭，曾加入过国民党和青年党。席炘出身于地主家庭，是日伪新民会的分子，并在日寇投降后积极歌颂蒋介石。俞康金原是贫农家庭出身，解放后他的家庭上升为富裕中农，他的资产阶级极端个人主义的思想，同他的富裕中农家庭的资本主义思想互相结合，就使得他背叛了党，走上反党反社会主义的道路。曾宪法、陈步、侯德彭，出身于资产阶级或自由职业者家庭，他们都具有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想，生活颓废，思想堕落，因个人欲望得不到满足而仇恨党，厌恶社会主义制度。
