Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet this evening to welcome the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria headed by Chairman Yugov.

Vice Chairman Zhu De attended the banquet.

At the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Yugov delivered speeches successively. In their speeches, they repeatedly emphasized strengthening the friendship between China and Bulgaria and the unity of the socialist camp, and expressed support for the just struggle of the Syrian people.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Just as all peace-loving countries and people in the world are striving to further ease international tensions, the US ruling clique is carrying out open military threats in the Near and Middle East, and rudely interfering in Syria's internal affairs. This provocative action by the United States not only seriously undermines the principles of the United Nations Charter, but also seriously threatens peace in the Near and Middle East and the world. This uneasy situation has aroused the greatest indignation and severe condemnation from Syria and other Arab countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world."

Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Peace in the Near and Middle East is closely related to the People's Republic of Bulgaria, which is located in the Balkan Peninsula. The Chinese people, like the Bulgarian people, fully support the just struggle of the Syrian people to safeguard national independence and peace in the Near and Middle East."

Premier Zhou Enlai also said: "The perverse actions of the US aggressive bloc in attempting to ignite a huge war in the Near and Middle East will only make them increasingly isolated in the world, while the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice will stand with the Syrian people more and more."

In his speech, Chairman Yugov also pointed out: "Our people firmly condemn all imperialist attempts and are deeply indignant at the attempts by certain imperialist groups to re-sharpen the situation in the Middle East."

Yugov said: "The Syrian people are powerfully resisting imperialist oppression and provocation, and are heroically defending their national independence."

Yugov also said: "Our country and the entire Bulgarian people unreservedly support the just struggle of the People's Republic of China to win recognition of its legitimate status in the United Nations and to restore its national territorial integrity and return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland." In his speech, he also repeatedly emphasized the need to strengthen the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and expressed support for the Soviet Union's consistent position on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The distinguished guests arrived at the Beijing Hotel lobby at 7:30 this evening. Premier Zhou Enlai and General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Deng Xiaoping, as well as Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai and Li Xiannian, were all waiting at the entrance of the lobby.

Also attending the banquet tonight were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian and others.

Also attending the banquet were the envoys of various countries to China.

A grand reception was held before the banquet. At the reception, Chairman Yugov and the Bulgarian government delegation, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai, met and shook hands one by one with the heads of our government, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and representatives from all walks of life in Beijing.

　　周总理欢宴保加利亚贵宾
　　周恩来总理和于哥夫主席一致表示
　　完全支持叙利亚人民的正义斗争
    新华社15日讯  周恩来总理今天晚上举行宴会，欢迎以于哥夫主席为首的保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团。
    朱德副主席出席了宴会。
    在宴会上，周恩来总理和于哥夫主席先后讲了话，他们在讲话中都一再强调要加强中保两国友谊和社会主义阵营的团结，并表示支持叙利亚人民的正义斗争。
    周总理在讲话中说：“正当全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民为进一步和缓国际紧张局势而努力的时候，美国统治集团却在中近东地区进行公开的军事威胁，粗暴地干涉叙利亚的内政。美国这种挑衅行动不仅严重地破坏了联合国宪章的原则，而且也严重地威胁着中近东地区和全世界的和平。这种不安的局势已经引起了叙利亚等阿拉伯国家和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的最大愤慨和严厉谴责。”
    周总理说：“中近东地区的和平对于处在巴尔干半岛的保加利亚人民共和国来说是息息相关的。中国人民如同保加利亚人民一样，完全支持叙利亚人民为维护民族独立和中近东和平而进行的正义斗争。”
    周总理还说：“美国侵略集团企图在中近东引起巨大战火的倒行逆施，只有使他们在世界上越来越孤立，而世界上爱好和平和维护正义的人民会越来越多地同叙利亚人民站在一起。”
    于哥夫主席在讲话中也指出：“我国人民坚决谴责一切帝国主义的企图，并且对某些帝国主义集团重新使中东局势尖锐化的企图感到十分愤慨。”
    于哥夫说：“叙利亚人民有力地反击帝国主义的压迫和挑衅，并且英勇地保卫着自己的民族独立。”
    于哥夫还说：“我们的国家和全体保加利亚人民毫无保留地支持中华人民共和国为争取承认它在联合国中取得合法地位的权利，为争取恢复国家领土完整，使台湾回到祖国的怀抱而进行的正义斗争。”他在讲话中还一再强调要加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巩固和团结，并表示支持苏联关于裁军和禁止原子武器的一贯主张。
    贵宾们在晚上七时半来到北京饭店大厅。周恩来总理和中共中央总书记邓小平以及副总理彭德怀、李先念等，都在大厅入口处迎候。
    参加今晚宴会的，还有副委员长李济深、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通，最高人民法院院长董必武，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长张闻天等人。
    参加宴会的还有各国驻中国的使节。
    在宴会前举行了盛大的酒会。在酒会上，于哥夫主席和保政府代表团由朱德副主席和周恩来总理等陪同，一一地与我国政府、各民主党派、人民团体的负责人以及北京市各界代表人物见面握手。
