　　On the Anti-Rightist Front

　　Tearing Off the Mask, Revealing His True Colors: Li Weicheng Was Consistently Anti-Communist

　　In the anti-rightist struggle, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China exposed the rightist Li Weicheng's actions of pretending to be progressive while consistently opposing the Communist Party.

　　Li Weicheng was a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. He consistently boasted about how progressive he was before liberation and complained that the Communist Party did not give him high positions and generous salaries. In reality, these were all outrageous lies. Before liberation, Li Weicheng was the general manager of the pseudo-Shaanxi Provincial Bank and had close ties with the Trotskyist Zhang Mutao and the "Revival Society," extremely loyal to the Kuomintang regime. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government even allowed him to serve as a public-share director of the joint public-private banks of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and deputy director of the Research and Design Committee of the Board of Directors, and he became a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　Political Swindler Cannot Deceive People: Wang Mingyuan's Reactionary Remarks Exposed

　　The Guangzhou Teachers' College exposed the anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks of the political swindler Wang Mingyuan.

　　Wang Mingyuan was originally a lecturer in the History and Politics Department of the Teachers' College. He claimed to have been engaged in education for more than 20 years and served as a lecturer and professor in seven colleges and universities. Therefore, he shouted hoarsely: "If my professorial title is not restored, I will go to Hong Kong and write articles for the 'Sing Tao Daily'." He also said: "I just want to scold you. Scolding is my democratic right."

　　It was revealed that Wang Mingyuan was not a "professor" at all. He only managed to infiltrate Sun Yat-sen University as a lecturer for a time because he joined the Kuomintang's "Revival Society" and relied on the power of secret agents.

　　Xiao Yu'an Tries His Best to Smear the Party's Leadership

　　Xiao Yu'an, an engineer at the Changsha Branch of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute and a rightist, was a general who launched a frenzied attack on the Party.

　　He slandered the Party's leadership, saying, "Twelve million Party members rule 600 million people, riding on the heads of the people, which is no different from the rule of a few over the majority in the old society." He openly cursed: "The Party absorbs a new member, which means adding another person who is divorced from the masses."

　　Xiao Yu'an also incited and won over the masses to follow him, and those who were unwilling to follow him were scolded for "forgetting their roots" (his roots, of course, refer to the Kuomintang reactionary regime). However, all his conspiracies have been crushed by the masses' relentless exposure and refutation.

　　Tan Rongshan Has Ulterior Motives and Maliciously Attacks the Socialist System

　　The ugly face of Tan Rongshan, a rightist cloaked in the guise of a Communist Party member, has been exposed by the staff of the county-level organs in Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province.

　　Tan Rongshan slandered agricultural cooperativization, saying: "Cooperativization cannot be mentioned, people are pulling plows everywhere," and "The propaganda before farmers joined the cooperative was better than heaven, but the reality after joining was worse than hell." Tan Rongshan also maliciously slandered the Party's leaders and cadres, saying, "Anyway, it's a new emperor with each dynasty. Once they ascend the throne, they forget the farmers." Even the reasonable matter of Party members paying Party dues was slandered by him as "exploitation."

　　在反右派战线上
    撕破伪装现原形李维城原来一贯反共
    中国人民银行总行在反右派斗争中，揭露了右派分子李维城伪装进步，一贯反共的言行。
    李维城是民革中央团结委员，他一贯吹嘘自己解放前如何进步，埋怨共产党不给他高官厚禄，实际上，这些都是弥天大谎。解放前，李维城是伪陕西省银行总经理，与托派张慕陶和“复兴社”关系密切，极力效忠于国民党政权。解放后，党和人民政府还让他担任人民银行总行公私合营银行公股董事和董事会研究设计委员会副主任委员，并当上了政协北京市委员。
    政治骗子骗不了人王名元反动言行被揭露
    广州师范专科学校揭露了政治骗子王名元的反共反社会主义言行。
    王名元原是师专历史政治科讲师。他自称从事教育事业二十多年，在七个高等学校当过讲师和教授。因此声嘶力竭地说：“如果不恢复我的教授学衔，就要到香港去，给‘星岛日报’写文章。”他还说：“我就是要骂你们。骂是我的民主权利。”
    据揭露，王名元根本不是什么“教授”，他只是因为加入了国民党的“复兴社”，依靠特务势力一度混入中山大学任讲师。
    萧豫安极力污蔑党的领导
    有色冶金设计总院长沙分院的工程师，右派分子萧豫安，是向党猖狂进攻的一员大将。
    他污蔑党的领导“是一千二百万党员统治六亿人民，骑在人民头上，和过去旧社会少数人统治多数人没有什么不同。”他公开谩骂：“党吸收一个新党员，就是增加一个脱离群众的人”。
    萧豫安还煽动，拉拢群众跟着他走，不愿意跟他走的，就骂他们“是忘本思想”（他的本当然是指国民党反动政权）。可是，他的一切阴谋，在群众的无情揭发驳斥下，已被粉碎了。
    谭荣善居心不善恶意攻击社会主义制度
    披着共产党员外衣的右派分子谭荣善的丑恶面目，已经被山西省垣曲县级机关工作人员揭发出来。
    谭荣善污蔑农业合作化说：“合作化不能提，到处出现人拉犁”，“农民入社前宣传的比天堂还好，入社后实际比地狱还糟”。谭荣善还恶意诽谤党的领袖和干部，说什么“反正是一朝天子一朝臣，只要登上宝座，就忘了农民”。甚至党员交党费这样合理的事情，他都诬蔑是“剥削”。
