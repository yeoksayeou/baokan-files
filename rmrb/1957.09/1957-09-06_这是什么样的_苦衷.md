What Kind of "Hardship" Is This?
The *Wenhui Bao* resident Beijing reporter and rightist element Yao Fangzao, in his "Beijing Letters" which maliciously attacked the Party, raised the question of "Why are Party member intellectuals less enthusiastic about the Party's 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend' policy than non-Party members?" Thereupon, Zhang Huanran, a rightist element and staff member of the Propaganda Department of the Anqing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, stepped forward and, with so-called "personal experience," loudly proclaimed: "Party members also have their hardships!" (See *Wenhui Bao*, May 23), echoing Yao Fangzao. He wrote: "There is a kind of public opinion that Party members should be cautious when speaking, pay attention to political impact, and not speak carelessly; otherwise, they are being undisciplined and unorganized. This public opinion comes from leading comrades and also from all sides..." "Unspoken, invisible regulations of unknown origin have resulted in Party members being as cold as ice to non-Party comrades." Zhang Huanran, cloaked in the guise of anti-dogmatism, actually portrayed the Party in utter darkness.

Anhui Daily published an article by Tang Xiangxian refuting this fallacy. The article said, do Party members really have "hardships"? Is there really no democracy within the Party? Are Party members really as cold as ice to people? Let us discuss the "facts" cited in the "Hardships" article!

One example is the case of Comrade Yu Tianming, a secretary of the Propaganda Department, who was "attacked" for submitting an article to *Wenhui Bao* during the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in the autumn of 1955. According to revelations by comrades in the Propaganda Department, this is a complete distortion by Zhang Huanran. Comrade Yu Tianming suffered from serious liberalism, and his writing often had exaggerations. He was criticized in a Party group meeting against unhealthy tendencies. At the time, some people suspected that the content of his article for *Wenhui Bao* might also be problematic, but no one accused him of submitting it to a non-Party newspaper. Zhang Huanran, however, fabricated facts and distorted the truth, revealing his maliciousness.

Another example is the problem of Ren Chunfu, a theory teacher at the Guichi County Political School, being "interfered with" when lecturing. After investigation and verification, the situation was this: In mid-April of this year, Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" given at the Supreme State Conference had been conveyed at provincial-level organs and above, but had not been conveyed at all at the county level, nor had it been published in newspapers, nor had its study been arranged. However, Ren Chunfu of Guichi County Political School, without first requesting instructions from the county Party committee, arbitrarily convened more than 500 people from county-level organs to report on "The Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." This was clearly an act of being undisciplined and unorganized, and the county Party committee's timely intervention was entirely necessary. But in Zhang Huanran's view, this restricted Party members' "freedom of speech" and was a "hardship."

The examples in Zhang Huanran's article are either completely fabricated or based on unfounded rumors, so they all fall apart upon verification. And in clarifying the truth, Zhang Huanran's ugly anti-Party face is completely exposed.

### 这是什么样的“苦衷”

    这是什么样的“苦衷”
    文汇报驻京记者、右派分子姚芳藻在他所写的恶意地攻击党的“北京书简”里，提出所谓“为什么党员知识分子对党的‘百齐花放、百家争鸣’政策反而不如党外人士积极？”的问题来后，中共安庆地委宣传部的工作人员右派分子张焕然挺身而出，以所谓“切身体会”大声疾呼：“党员同志也有苦衷！”（见5月23日文汇报），与姚芳藻一唱一和。他写道：“有这样一种舆论，就是党员讲话要慎重，要注意政治影响，不能乱讲，否则，就是无组织无纪律。这种舆论来自领导同志，也来自四面八方……” “不知来自何处的不成文的无形的规定，于是党员对党外同志只好冷若冰霜”。披着反教条主义外衣的张焕然，竟然把党内描写得漆黑一团。
    安徽日报发表唐象贤的文章，驳斥这种谬论。文章说，党员真的有“苦衷”吗？党内真的没有民主吗？党员真是对人冷若冰霜吗？且谈“苦衷”一文所举的“事实”吧！
    例子之一，是1955年秋季开展反对胡风反革命集团斗争时，宣传部秘书于天明同志向文汇报投稿而被“打击”的事。经宣传部的同志揭发，这是张焕然彻头彻尾的歪曲于天明同志自由主义严重，写稿子常常有夸张的毛病，曾在一次反对不良倾向的党小组会上受到批判。当时有人怀疑他向文汇报写的稿子内容是否也有问题，但并没有指责他不该向党外报纸投稿，而张焕然竟信口雌黄，歪曲事实，其恶毒可见。
    例子之二，是贵池县政校理论教员任春富讲课受到“干涉”的问题。经过揭发与核对，原来是这样：今年4月中旬，毛主席在最高国务会议作的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”报告，省以上机关虽已分级传达，但县里根本还没有传达，报纸上也未公开，也还没有布置学习。而贵池县政校任春富事先没有请示县委，就擅自召集县直机关五百余人报告“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”。这显然是无组织、无纪律的行为，县委予以及时制止是完全必要的。可是在张焕然看来，这是限制了党员的“言论自由”，是“苦衷”。
    张焕然文章中的例子，因为完全都是捏造或捕风捉影，所以经过对证都不攻自破。而在辨明是非当中，张焕然反党的丑恶面目则暴露无余。
