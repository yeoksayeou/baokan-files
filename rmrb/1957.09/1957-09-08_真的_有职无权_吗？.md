	Is it Really "Having a Position Without Power"?
	Zhong Huai
	A few days ago, a Xinhua News Agency reporter revealed the truth about Jiang Zhenzhong, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Justice and Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, who claimed to "have a position without power": Although Jiang Zhenzhong actually took charge of the leadership work of the entire Department of Justice, he usually only announced the start of meetings when he presided over the department's meetings, without making any speeches. He rarely read the official documents submitted to him for approval, simply signing his name, and never expressed any opinions on the issues raised in the documents. During his two years as director, he never went to the divisions to understand the situation or provide guidance...

	Coincidentally, Li Xiangruo, Director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Justice and Chairman of the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, also said that he "had a position without power." What was the actual situation? Recently, the staff of the Anhui Provincial Department of Justice listed many facts to show that Li Xiangruo had both a position and power. However, since the issue of power was brought up, they also frankly introduced how Li Xiangruo exercised his power. Here are a few examples: The documents submitted to Li Xiangruo for approval by the responsible personnel were always piled up on his desk, and then dozens or even hundreds of them were returned at once, merely with the character "Li" written on them. Sometimes, the responsible personnel would present several different handling opinions for a certain document, submitting it for his approval, and he would also just write the character "Li" on it. At the end of 1956, the Ministry of Justice issued a draft work plan for 1957, requiring the department to discuss it and submit opinions promptly, but Li Xiangruo shelved this important document for a long time without offering any opinions, again just writing the character "Li"...

	Instead of deeply reflecting on their failure to fulfill their duties and responsibilities, these director gentlemen turned around and claimed to "have a position without power," as if the Communist Party had really turned non-Party cadres into clay sculptures of Buddha. What was their intention? The answer is simple: it was nothing more than to smear the Communist Party's face, portraying the Communist Party as a sectarian small group that couldn't be seen in public, so that these right-wing heroes could rise up and replace it. This is the same trick as some other right-wing elements who tried their best to uglify Party leaders, uglify Party members, uglify Party newspapers, uglify worker-peasant cadres, uglify activists...

	But since the smear is applied, it can also be wiped away. Once the facts are presented and the truth is revealed, black and white will be distinguished, and right and wrong will be clarified. Now everyone can see clearly: the deeds of those who are accustomed to reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong cannot stand the light of day!

    真的“有职无权”吗？
    钟怀
    前几天，新华社记者揭露了浙江省司法厅长、民盟浙江省委主任委员姜震中叫喊“有职无权”的真相：尽管姜震中实际上担负着整个司法厅的领导工作，可是他每次主持厅务会议大都只宣布开会，不发言。送给他审批的公文，他很少细看，只签个名就算，对公文中提出的问题从不表示意见。在他担任厅长的两年中，从来没有到处里去了解过情况和指导过工作……。
    无独有偶。安徽省的司法厅长、农工民主党合肥市主任委员李湘若也说自己“有职无权”。实际情形又如何呢？最近安徽省司法厅的工作人员列举许多事实说明李湘若是有职有权的。不过既然谈到职权问题，他们也就不客气地介绍了李湘若是怎样行使自己的职权的。举几个例子：承办人送给李湘若批示的文件，他总是成堆地压在办公桌上，然后几十件甚至成百件地一次退回，仅仅在文件上画个“李”字就算了事。有时承办人对某一个文件提出几种不同的处理意见，送请他核定，他也是画个“李”字了事。1956年底，司法部发下1957年工作计划草案，要厅里讨论后提出意见迅速上报，李湘若将这一重要文件压了很久，什么意见也未提，还是画个“李”字了事……。
    这些厅长先生们不深自检讨未能尽职守责，却反咬一口，说什么“有职无权”，好像共产党真的把非党干部弄成泥塑木雕的菩萨一般。其用意何在？答案很简单，无非是要在共产党脸上抹黑灰，把共产党说成见不得人的宗派主义小集团，以便这些右派英雄们起来取而代之。这同另外一些右派分子竭力丑化党的领导人、丑化党员、丑化党报、丑化工农干部、丑化积极分子……，原是一个伎俩。
    但是黑灰既然是抹上去的，也就可以抹掉。把事实一摆，真相一揭，就会黑白分明，是非分明。现在人人都看得清：那些惯于颠倒黑白、混淆是非的人的所作所为，是怎样地见不得阳光！
