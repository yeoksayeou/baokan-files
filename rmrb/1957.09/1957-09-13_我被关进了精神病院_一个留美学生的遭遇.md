I Was Locked Up in a Mental Hospital
The Experience of a Returned Student from the United States

Recently, a reporter interviewed Zeng Guangzhi, a returned student who had just returned from the United States. Zeng Guangzhi originally studied organic chemistry at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana, USA. Last spring, after the U.S. Immigration Bureau learned that he wanted to return to China, they locked him up in a mental hospital, tormenting him for as long as fourteen months before forcibly "deporting" him. The following is Zeng Guangzhi's account to the reporter of the persecution he suffered in the United States.

"In March 1956, my mother wrote to me saying that she had requested Ambassador Wang Bingnan, our representative negotiating with the United States in Geneva, to help me return to China. Soon after, I received notifications from Ambassador Wang and the Indian Embassy in the United States regarding assistance for my return to China. At that time, it was the middle of a semester. Considering my courses, research, and work contract, and the fact that my asthma was undergoing basic treatment, I planned to return to China after the semester ended. Unexpectedly, after the U.S. Immigration Bureau learned about this, they began to persecute me. One day in mid-April of last year, I was working as usual in the university's chemistry laboratory, completely focused on my work, when suddenly, Titchenor, the foreign student advisor at Purdue University, barged in with two menacing policemen, claiming that the Immigration Bureau wanted to question me. Without any explanation, they dragged me into a car and sent me to the Wabash Valley Mental Hospital.

"According to U.S. law, a court verdict is required to send a patient to a mental hospital. However, when I was arrested, the police had neither an arrest warrant nor a court verdict. My mental state was completely normal. I worked in the laboratory for about seventy hours a week, and my grades were all A's. In terms of lifestyle, I had no unusual behavior. Both Chinese and American classmates can attest to this. Precisely because the Immigration Bureau could not prove that I had a mental illness, they resorted to kidnapping me and locking me up in a mental hospital. This is clearly a serious violation of human rights. In the United States, the accusations of mentally ill people have no legal effect, and therefore they do not receive legal protection. This makes it easy to understand why the U.S. government frequently uses this method as a means of political persecution.

"In the mental hospital, I suffered appalling mental and physical torture and abuse. At the Wabash Valley Mental Hospital, I was locked up like a prisoner in a small room with only a small round hole in the door. If I needed to urinate or defecate, I had to shout myself hoarse before someone would come to escort me out. For the first two days, even though I was clearly not ill, they forcibly gave me tranquilizer injections, making me mentally weak. However, one day when my asthma flared up, no one cared for me. Later, when I requested the doctor to retrieve the medicine I had bought myself from the school and administer it on time, they turned a deaf ear. In mid-May of last year, they wanted to transfer me to a state hospital. Knowing that this meant long-term imprisonment, I declared that I would not go. However, they forcibly injected me with tranquilizers. Several burly men dragged me, upside down, into a car, brutally handcuffed me (scraping both hands raw due to excessive force, leaving scars on my right wrist to this day), and then a sheriff personally drove, with two special agents on either side, escorting me to Logansport State Hospital.

"My treatment here was even worse. They used many methods, both soft and hard, to try to make me yield and abandon my desire to return to China. First, they put me under mental pressure, deliberately confining me to the ward for severely ill patients. Especially after I refused to do chemical analysis work for the hospital's laboratory, they kept me in a large ward with many mentally deranged patients for a long time. I was beaten by mentally ill patients several times, once even knocked to the ground. I repeatedly requested a transfer to a different ward, but they ignored me.

"In the hospital, they also restricted my freedom to communicate with my family. Every word in my letters had to be approved by them before being sent. Over the course of a year, I wrote forty or fifty letters, but only four or five were delivered, and I could only guess which letters had been sent based on the replies from my family. My mother wrote to the hospital, requesting my release on humanitarian grounds. I also repeatedly told the hospital that my mother was sick in the countryside of Hunan and had no one to take care of her. But the hospital remained indifferent to these requests.

"My asthma was never seriously treated. From August to October of last year, my asthma was severe, and I often did not receive medication when it flared up at night. The nurses used the excuse of being busy to avoid giving me injections, and they did not replenish the medicine after it ran out. Even when I offered to pay for it myself, the doctors refused, claiming they could not find anyone to buy the medicine for me. The most shameless thing was that when I couldn't sleep at night due to the illness, a staff member would often come to talk to me, expressing 'sympathy' and constantly hinting that I should apply for American citizenship, clearly trying to take advantage of my fear of asthma to apply for permanent residency. This kind of opportunistic behavior filled me with great revulsion.

"At the same time, the hospital constantly suggested that I help with work in the laboratory. Some groups and pastors outside the hospital also offered to introduce me to jobs, and as long as I agreed, they would release me from the hospital, and after working for a few months, I would have freedom of movement. The intention was very clear: to make me abandon the idea of returning to China.

"Because I repeatedly expressed my determination to return to China, the U.S. Immigration Bureau and hospital authorities repeatedly threatened and made things difficult for me. The Immigration Bureau first wanted me to admit that the Chinese government had put pressure on me to force me to return to China, then pretended to be confused and unaware of my request to return to China. Finally, they became angry out of embarrassment and announced that I should not even think about invoking the Geneva Accords to return to China, but could only be 'deported' back to China, and threatened to 'detain me indefinitely.' Although I stated that I did not want to be deported and wanted to return to China with the assistance of the Indian Embassy, the hospital authorities suppressed the application forms sent by the Indian Embassy for a long time and refused to release them. After I agreed to accept the form of deportation to return to China, the Immigration Bureau, seeing that my determination to return to China was unshakable, deliberately delayed and repeatedly changed the date.

"On June 14th of this year, the Immigration Bureau finally announced my deportation. I was taken from the hospital to Chicago and spent the night in the Immigration Bureau jail. Originally, they said they would escort me to San Francisco to board a ship, but the next morning, they put me in a prison car and drove me to the airport, taking a plane to Los Angeles on the West Coast to board a ship. For the two Immigration Bureau escorts, this was a wonderful mission, a pleasant trans-Pacific holiday trip. To reward their loyal service, the U.S. ruling group gave them first-class tickets, and they could enjoy the treatment of first-class passengers as much as possible – sunbathing on the deck, bars, dances… But I was locked in a stuffy cabin, only able to peek at the outside world through a small round hole in the door, silently calculating the date of arrival in my motherland. Later, only because of the discovery of Chinese classmates returning to China on the same ship, after repeated negotiations, the Immigration Bureau escorts allowed me to walk on the deck for ten minutes every day and have visitors every other day, for only two hours each time, with no more than two people each time. But they automatically found Taiwanese personnel working at the United Nations to talk to me, which was utterly shameless.

"On July 6th, I was escorted to Shenzhen. It is impossible to describe the feeling of a person who had been deprived of freedom abroad for a long time, now stepping back onto his homeland and regaining freedom. When I angrily looked back at the two U.S. Immigration Bureau personnel, I found that they had run far away. It turned out that these two usually arrogant fellows, having been poisoned by the U.S. propaganda machine for a long time, had long been harboring hidden fears along the way, secretly discussing whether the 'Red Army' on the border would 'shoot' at them, so they didn't even have time to say the most basic polite phrase of 'goodbye' and immediately fled in panic.

"I was subjected to fourteen months of abuse and humiliation in a mental hospital in the United States. Thanks to the help of our government, I finally escaped from the 'free' and 'democratic' country of the United States and returned to the embrace of my motherland. I sent two letters on the way to my mother, who had been waiting for my return on her sickbed, but after arriving in Guangzhou, I learned that my mother had not had time to see me one last time and had passed away in January of this year, filled with regret!

"In the United States, they didn't let me speak. Now that I'm back in my motherland, I have the right to speak! I want to accuse, I want to tell the American people who have been deceived about many truths that in the United States, I was deprived of my freedom! Finally, I will dedicate all my strength to participate in the construction of the motherland!"

The Geneva Accords were signed two years ago. Zeng Guangzhi's personal experience vividly illustrates how the U.S. government disregards international agreements and tramples on human rights. This situation helps readers further understand the so-called "free" and "democratic" countries praised by the right-wing elements.

　　我被关进了精神病院
    一个留美学生的遭遇
    最近，记者访问了刚从美国归来的留学生曾广植。曾广植原在美国印第安纳州拉斐德城的帕都大学研读有机化学。去年春天，美国移民局知道他想回国以后，就将他关进精神病院，折磨他达十四个月之久，后来才被迫将他“驱逐出境”。下面是曾广植向记者叙述他在美国遭受迫害的经过。
    “1956年3月，我母亲来信说，她已经要求在日内瓦同美国谈判的我国代表王炳南大使帮助我回国。不久，我就接到了王大使以及印度驻美大使馆关于协助我回国的通知。当时正是一学期的中间，我考虑到我的课程、研究和工作合同，同时我的气喘病正作基本性治疗，因此准备在学期结束以后动身回国，不料美国移民局知道这件事以后，开始对我进行迫害。去年4月中旬某一天，我和平常一样正全神贯注地在大学的化学实验室里工作，突然，帕都大学的外国学生顾问提彻诺尔带了两个气势汹汹的警察闯进门来，说是移民局要查问我，不由分说的将我挟上汽车，送进瓦巴什山谷的精神病院。
    “根据美国法律，送病人进精神病院，必须要有法院的判决。而我被捕时，警察既无逮捕状，又无法院判决书。我的精神状态很正常，我每周在实验室工作约七十小时，我的功课成绩都是甲等，在生活方面也没有异乎常人的行为。不论中国或美国同学，都可以证明这些。正因为移民局无法证明我有精神病，所以才采取绑架方式将我关入精神病院。这显然是严重地侵犯人权的行为。在美国，精神病人的控诉没有法律效力，因而也就得不到法律保护。这就不难理解，美国政府为什么经常用这个办法来作为政治迫害的手段。
    “在精神病院里，我的精神和肉体受到惊人的折磨和虐待。在瓦巴什山谷的精神病院，我像囚犯一样被单独锁在一间房门上只有一个小圆洞的小屋里，若要大小便，必须叫唤得声嘶力竭，才有人来押出去。刚到头两天，我明明没有病，却硬给我打麻药针，弄得精神萎靡不振。但是有一天我的气喘病发作了，却无人照顾，甚至以后我请求医生将我自己买的针药从学校取来，按时注射，他们也置若罔闻。去年5月中旬，他们要将我转到州立医院，我知道这表示要将我长期监禁，因此我声明不去。但是他们强迫给我注射麻药针。几个彪形大汉横拖倒曳地将我抬上汽车，又野蛮地给我戴上手拷（由于用力过猛，把两手都刮破了，右手腕至今留下疤痕），然后一位警长亲自开车，两旁两个特务挟持，将我送往洛干斯波特州立医院。
    “在这里我的遭遇更坏。他们对我采用了许多软硬兼施的办法，企图使我屈服，放弃回国的愿望。首先，他们在精神上对我施加压力，故意把我关在严重病室里。特别在我拒绝替医院化验室做化学分析工作以后，他们长期地让我和许多精神错乱的病人住在一个大病室里。我数次被精神病人殴伤，有一次甚至被打翻在地上。我多次要求调换病房，他们置之不理。
    “在医院里，他们还限制我和家庭通信的自由。我信中的一字一句，都得经过他们同意才能发出。一年来我写过四五十封信，通过的不过四五封，并且唯有从家信中才能猜到那一封信是发出了。我母亲曾写信给医院，要求在人道立场上释放我。我也向医院数次提出，母亲在湖南乡下生病，无人照顾。但院方对这些请求都无动于衷。
    “我的气喘病，从未认真给我治疗。去年8月到10月，我的气喘病严重，晚上病发作时往往得不到医药。护士借口忙不给我打针，在针药用完后也不补充。甚至我自己愿意出钱买，大夫也推托找不到人替我买药。最无耻的，就是在我发病晚上不能入睡时，有个服务员常来找我谈话，对我表示‘同情’，并不断暗示我最好申请美国籍，显然想利用我害怕气喘病的心理，申请永久居留权。这种乘人之危的作法，使我产生极大的反感。
    “同时，医院又不断建议我到化验室帮助工作，院外的一些团体和牧师，也纷纷要替我介绍职业，并且只要我同意，就可以放我出院，工作几个月后就可以让我行动自由。这种意图是很明显的，就是要我放弃回国的念头。
    “由于我一再表示要求回国的决心，美国移民局和医院当局对我一再威胁和刁难。移民局先是要我承认中国政府曾经对我施压力逼我回国，继之又装糊涂不知道我要求回国，最后老羞成怒，宣布我休想引用日内瓦协议回国，只能被‘驱逐’回国，并威胁要将我‘长期拘留’。尽管我声明不愿被驱逐，而由印度大使馆襄助回国，但是医院当局却将印度大使馆送来我填写好了的申请表格长期压下不发。等到我同意接受驱逐形式回国，移民局看我回国决心不可动摇，却又故意拖延，一再改变日期。
    “今年6月14日，移民局终于宣布将我驱逐出境。我从医院被押送到芝加哥，在移民局牢里过了一夜，原先说是押我到旧金山上船，但是第二天清早，他们却把我装上囚车开往机场，乘飞机到西海岸的洛杉矶上船。对移民局两个押解人员来说，这是一个美好的差使，一次愉快的横渡太平洋的假期旅行，美国统治集团为了酬劳他们的忠心服务，赐给头等船票，他们可以尽量享受头等船舱客人的待遇——甲板上的日光浴、酒吧、舞会……而我却被锁在一个闷气的船舱里，只能从门上的小圆洞窥探着外面的世界，默默地计算着到达祖国的日期。后来只是由于同船回国的中国同学的发现，经过多次交涉，移民局押解人员才允许我每天可以在甲板上散步十分钟，每隔一天会客一次，时间只许两小时，每次不得超过两人。但是他们却自动把在联合国工作的台湾人员找来和我谈话，真是无耻之至。
    “7月6日，我被押到深圳，对一个在国外长期失去自由的人，现在重新踏上国土恢复自由时的心情，无法形容。当我愤怒地回头看那两个美国移民局人员时，才发现他们已经跑得很远了。原来这两个平日神气活现的家伙，由于长期受到美国宣传机器的毒害，一路上早就怀着鬼胎，窃窃私议边境上的‘红军’会对他们‘开枪’，因此连一声‘再见’这样最起码的客套话也来不及说，立即抱头鼠窜了。
      “我在美国的精神病院受了十四个月的虐待和侮辱，由于我国政府的帮助，终于脱离美国这个‘自由’和‘民主’的国家，回到祖国怀抱。我在路上发了两封信给那在病床上一直盼我归来的母亲，但是到了广州后，才知道我的母亲来不及最后见我一面，已在今年1月含恨而终了！
    “在美国，他们不让我说话，现在我回到祖国，我有说话的权利了！我要控诉，我要告诉被蒙蔽了许多事情真相的美国人民，在美国，我曾经被剥夺了自由！最后，我将以全副力量参加祖国建设！”
    日内瓦协议签订已两周年了。曾广植个人的遭遇，生动地说明美国政府如何藐视国际协议和蹂躏人权，这种情况有助于读者对右派分子所称颂备至的所谓“自由”与“民主”国家作进一步的认识。
