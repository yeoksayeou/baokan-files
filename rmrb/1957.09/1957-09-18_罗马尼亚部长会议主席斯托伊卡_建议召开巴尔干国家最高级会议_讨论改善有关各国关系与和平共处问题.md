Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 17th: Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Stoica has suggested convening a conference of the highest-level representatives of the governments of Balkan countries to discuss improving and developing relations among the countries in the region and strengthening the friendship and peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the region.

This suggestion was made by Stoica in letters sent on September 10th to the heads of government of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. Today, Bucharest newspapers published Stoica's letters to the heads of government of these countries.

In his letter, Stoica said that the Romanian government firmly believes that establishing comprehensive peaceful cooperation relations among the Balkan countries is in the best interests of the peoples of the region and the interests of world peace.

Stoica said, "The Romanian government believes that it is necessary, without hesitation, to have the highest-level representatives of the relevant countries jointly study cooperation issues. Therefore, I suggest that a conference be held in 1957 in a suitable capital city, with the participation of the leaders of the governments of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Romania. We would also be pleased to hold this conference in Bucharest, the capital of Romania."

Stoica said that in order to ensure long-term cooperation among the Balkan countries, the Romanian government suggests signing a joint agreement on guaranteeing peace and the prosperity and progress of the peoples in the region. The Balkan Agreement should be based on the complete equality of the participating countries in terms of rights and interests, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Stoica also emphasized that the purpose of the Balkan countries' agreement is not to establish a bloc.

　　罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡
　　建议召开巴尔干国家最高级会议
　　讨论改善有关各国关系与和平共处问题
    据新华社布加勒斯特17日电  罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡建议召开巴尔干各国政府最高级代表会议，讨论改善和发展这个地区的各国关系以及加强这个地区各国人民之间的友好与和平共处的问题。
    这项建议是斯托伊卡在9月10日给阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、希腊、南斯拉夫和土耳其政府首脑的信中提出的。今天布加勒斯特各报发表了斯托伊卡给这些国家政府首脑的信。
    斯托伊卡在信中说，罗马尼亚政府深信建立巴尔干地区各国多方面的和平的合作关系是符合这个地区人民的各方面的利益和世界和平的利益的。
    斯托伊卡说，“罗马尼亚政府认为有必要毫不迟疑地让有关各国的最高级代表来共同研究合作问题。因此我建议1957年在某一适当的首都举行由阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、希腊、南斯拉夫、土耳其和罗马尼亚政府领导人参加的会议。我们也很高兴在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特举行这次会议”。
    斯托伊卡说，为了使巴尔干各国长久合作，罗马尼亚政府建议签订一项关于保证这一地区的和平及人民的繁荣进步的共同协定。巴尔干协定应该建立在参加国在权益上完全平等、互相尊重主权和不干涉内政的基础上。
    斯托伊卡还强调指出巴尔干国家协定的目的并不是为了建立一个集团。
