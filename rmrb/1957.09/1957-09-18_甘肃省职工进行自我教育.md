This is a report from our correspondent Liu Bang in Lanzhou on the 16th: Nearly seventy industrial and mining enterprises in Gansu Province have convened worker representative conferences. Generally, each unit uses the worker representative conference to conduct socialist education among workers to counterattack the rightists. As a result, workers are more concerned about national affairs, more enthusiastic about studying politics, and internal unity among workers has also been strengthened. In the past, only 50% to 60% of the workers at the Yumen Oil Mine Drilling Company participated in political studies; now, the number has reached over 90%. Workers at the Jianxi Iron Factory did not subscribe to newspapers in the past, but now more than fifty workers have subscribed. The workers all say, "It won't do not to subscribe to newspapers; how can we counterattack the rightists if we don't study?" The workers in the water pump team of the Shajinyi Brick and Tile Factory had been experiencing disunity since August of last year. Now, the workers recognize the current situation, understand that disunity will offset the power of the working class and hinder production, and have therefore strengthened their unity. The workers' organizational discipline has also been strengthened.

　　甘肃省职工进行自我教育
    本报兰州16日电　记者柳梆报道：甘肃省已有近七十个工矿企业召开了职工代表大会。各单位一般都通过职工代表大会向职工进行反击右派的社会主义教育，所以职工们更加关心国家大事，更加热心学习政治，工人内部的团结也加强了。玉门油矿钻井公司的工人们，过去参加政治学习的只占总工人数的50％—60％，现在已达到90％以上。建西铁工厂的工人过去不订报，现在有五十多个工人订了报。职工们都说：“不订报纸不得了，不学习怎能反击右派呢？”沙金驿砖瓦厂水泵组工人，从去年8月以来就闹不团结，现在职工们认识到当前的形势，懂得不团结就会抵消工人阶级的力量，妨碍生产，因而增强了团结。职工们的组织性和纪律性也加强了。
