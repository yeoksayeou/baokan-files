Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: The Beijing Municipal People's Committee has decided to convert all seven cadre children's primary schools in the city into municipal ordinary primary schools starting this semester.

Of these seven primary schools, six will only accept day students and will not accept boarding students starting this semester. The newly enrolled primary school students are all admitted through open enrollment. The funding for these schools will also be issued according to the standard for general municipal primary schools starting from the beginning of this year's semester, with any shortfall being resolved by the schools collecting additional tuition and miscellaneous fees from students.

Some of these seven cadre children's primary schools were newly built after liberation, and some were moved from old liberated areas such as Yan'an. Under the circumstances of the cadre implementing the supply system and contracted system at that time, the existence of these primary schools was completely necessary. In recent years, the living standards of cadres have improved, and their work positions have also become fixed, so from 1955, these cadre children's primary schools began to transition to ordinary primary schools, and each year they enrolled some day students who were children of ordinary citizens.

Among these seven primary schools, only Yu Ying Primary School still retains a boarding system. This is because this school specifically admits orphans of revolutionary martyrs, general orphans in society, children whose parents are working in border areas or abroad, and children whose parents are on long-term convalescence, etc., and are not being cared for.

### 北京干部子弟小学全部改为普通小学

    北京干部子弟小学全部改为普通小学
    新华社3日讯　北京市人民委员会决定从这一学期起把全市七所干部子弟小学改为市立的普通小学。
    这七所小学，有六所在这学期起只收走读生，不收住宿生。新收的小学生都是经过公开招生录取的，这些学校的经费从今年开学起也按一般市立小学标准发给，不足部分由学校向学生增收学杂费来解决。
    这七所干部子弟小学有的是解放后新建的，有的是从延安等老解放区迁移来的，在当时干部实行供给制、包干制的情况下，这些小学的存在是完全必要的。近几年来，干部生活水平已经提高，工作岗位也固定下来，所以从1955年起，这些干部子弟小学就开始向普通小学过渡，每一年都招收了一些走读的市民子女。
    这七所小学中，现在只有育英小学仍保留寄宿制。因为这个学校专收革命烈士遗孤，社会上一般孤儿、父母双方在边疆或在国外工作和父母双方长期休养等无人照管的儿童。
