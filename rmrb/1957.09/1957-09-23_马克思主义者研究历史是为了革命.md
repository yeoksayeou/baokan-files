Marxists Study History for Revolution

    Lei Haizong's statement that Marxism stopped developing after Engels' death should not be regarded as merely his academic opinion, but also reflects his political attitude. Because this argument actually negates the Leninist stage of Marxism, negates Chairman Mao Zedong's creative development of Marxist theory, negates the new interpretations of Marxist theory by communists in various countries over the past half century, and even negates the revolutionary victories of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries as victories of Marxism. Although he later made some defenses, saying that his theory of Marxist stagnation was only limited to the field of history, even within the field of historical science, Marxism has not stopped its development. Many of Lenin's works have developed Marxist historical science. Many of Chairman Mao Zedong's works laid the foundation for Marxist research in Chinese history. Although Lenin and Mao Zedong mostly discussed issues of modern history, these works developed the basic theories of Marxist historical science. Although they always combined historical issues with revolutionary issues when discussing historical issues, it cannot be said that it is not historical science because it is combined with revolution. Marxist historical science is a science of struggle, a science of revolution. Marxists do not study history for the sake of studying history, but to change history, that is, to study history for the sake of revolution.

    马克思主义者研究历史是为了革命
    雷海宗所说的，从恩格斯死后马克思主义就停止了发展。这种议论不能认为只是他的学术见解，也反映了他的政治态度。因为这种议论，实际上就是否定马克思主义的列宁阶段，否定毛泽东主席对马克思主义理论的创造性的发展，否定半个世纪以来各国共产党人对马克思主义理论的新的阐发，甚至否定苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的革命胜利是马克思主义的胜利。虽然他后来也做了一些辩解，说他的马克思主义停滞论，只是限于历史学的范围。但就是在历史科学的范围内，马克思主义也没有停止它的发展，列宁的许多著作都发展了马克思主义的历史科学。毛泽东主席的许多著作，替马克思主义在中国史的研究方面奠定了基础。虽然列宁、毛泽东所论述的多是近代史方面的问题，但在这些著作中却发展了马克思主义历史科学的基本理论。虽然他们在论述历史问题的时候，总是结合革命问题，但并不能因为结合了革命就说不是历史科学，马克思主义的历史科学就是一种斗争的科学，革命的科学。马克思主义者不是为了研究历史而研究历史，而是为了改变历史，即为了革命而研究历史。（摘自1957年北京大学学报人文科学第三期翦伯赞：“反对资产阶级社会科学复辟”）
