    Peaceful Rockets
    Tu An
    American missiles—guided towards war,
    Soviet missiles—guided towards peace.
    The TASS statement (1) resonates like countless intercontinental missiles,
    shaking every city and village in the world.
    May the atomic dreams of the warmongers in the White House
    be shattered in mid-air along with the missiles they test! (2)
    May rockets spreading peace shoot from Moscow towards
    every corner, every place on the five continents!

    (1) On August 26th of this year, TASS announced that the Soviet Union had successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket (Note: a rocket with a warhead is a missile); and at the same time, it was authorized to declare that the Soviet Union is willing to reach a comprehensive disarmament agreement with Western countries. (2) In mid-June of this year, the United States test-launched an "Atlas" intercontinental missile, but it was destroyed due to mechanical failure immediately after launch.

    和平的火箭
    屠岸
    美国的导弹——导向战争，
    苏联的导弹——导向和平。
    塔斯社的声明（一）像无数枚洲际导弹震
    响着世界上所有的城市和乡村。
    让白宫里战争贩子们的原子狂梦
    随着他们试验的导弹一齐粉碎在半空！（二）
    愿散播和平的火箭从莫斯科射向
    五大洲的每一个角落，每一块地方！
    （一）今年八月二十六日，塔斯社宣布苏联已试验成功洲际弹道火箭（按：火箭加上弹头就是导弹）；同时受权声明苏联愿与西方国家达成全面的裁军协议。（二）今年六月中旬美国曾试验发射一枚“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹，但刚发射出去就因机件失灵而炸毁了。
