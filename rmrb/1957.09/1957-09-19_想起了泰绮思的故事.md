Reminded of the Story of Thaïs
　　Tang Tao

It's a story that's already very familiar, yet some people haven't learned a lesson from it and keep repeating the plot that predecessors have already told.

Anatole France wrote a novel about a monk in training who suddenly thinks of Thaïs, the famous courtesan of Alexandria, and sees her as a seductive and harmful temptress who misleads the youth of the world. To accumulate merit and save Thaïs and the youth she has seduced, he decides to convert her. He uses great effort to persuade Thaïs, and the prostitute destroys her worldly attire and enters a convent. But the matter is not finished. When the monk returns to his original place and continues his practice, he can no longer settle down. When he closes his eyes, he immediately sees demons and naked women. Day and night, he is in a state of mental turmoil. He flees and travels far away, but it is to no avail. Many people always bow to him, pray to him, and praise his virtue, but he cannot express the bitterness in his heart. In the end, he runs to Thaïs, opens his arms, and cries out, "My dear, I love you." Unexpectedly, Thaïs says that she has already seen the kingdom of heaven and soon dies.

I oppose Freudian psychoanalysis, so I don't agree with the conclusion implied by France's novel. I just want to use this story to illustrate the downfall of the anti-Party element Chen Yong. When Hu Feng's anti-revolutionary literary thought was criticized in 1955, Chen Yong, in the guise of a "brave warrior," lashed out at Hu Feng's reactionary literary thought. Before long, however, Hu Feng's ghost attached itself to Chen Yong, and this "brave warrior" completely accepted the opposing viewpoints he had criticized and stuffed them into his own head: Hu Feng opposed the Party's leadership in literature and art and advocated abolishing the Writers Association; Chen Yong also opposed the Party's literary and artistic line and opposed the Writers Association's leadership in creation. Hu Feng opposed ideological remolding and emphasized creative practice; Chen Yong also opposed writers participating in political activities and believed that ideological remolding could be achieved through artistic practice. Hu Feng argued that life exists everywhere and writers do not need to go among workers, peasants, and soldiers; Chen Yong also opposed depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers, arguing that there was no difference in subject matter and that going deep into life would not necessarily produce good works. Hu Feng dismissed the achievements made after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, and Chen Yong also negated achievements, exaggerated shortcomings, and condemned one by one the works that the people loved to see and hear. In short, today's Chen Yong has become the Hu Feng who was criticized at the time, and it is difficult to see any difference between them. This reminds me of the story in France's novel. Of course, all analogies are clumsy. Thaïs is not necessarily a bad person, and Hu Feng did not "enter a convent" like Thaïs—leaving his own anti-revolutionary home—and would not see the "kingdom of heaven," the socialist kingdom of heaven. However, Chen Yong's possession is real. When he shouted "I love you" to Hu Feng, this time it was Hu Feng who opened his arms and said, "Come on!" They embraced each other and fell together on the basis of anti-Party sentiment.

This is the whole truth of the matter.

Why did this happen? France uses Freudian theory to explain this phenomenon, which is wrong. Leaving aside Thaïs, in terms of the facts before us, there was originally something in common between the "monk" Chen Yong and the "prostitute" Hu Feng. Chen Yong's "virtue" was false and hypocritical, and his main fault was that his "six roots were not pure." Deep in his mind were still bourgeois decadent literary views that centered on the individual. Just like when Feng Xuefeng criticized Hu Feng in 1955 and had to "tear it up and write it again, write it and tear it up again," and finally didn't write a single word, Chen Yong, although he rode into battle, was just pretending to fire a few shots, saw his own soul reflected in Hu Feng's "five knives," and surrendered.

Here we can also point out that one of the reasons why Chen Yong and Feng Xuefeng shared the same views, regarded each other as "confidants," and finally participated in his anti-Party activities, apart from other reasons, was that Xuefeng's thought and Hu Feng's were intertwined. In Xuefeng's own words, "I don't know whether I influenced Hu Feng, or Hu Feng influenced me." The stench they emitted was consistent, and Chen Yong hit it off with them on this point—that is, on the basis of anti-Party sentiment. Birds of a feather flock together, truly.

The situation of "impure six roots" among intellectuals is still quite common, so I am not saying that we ourselves must be an uncompromising Marxist in order to criticize others. I am saying that we must adhere to the truth, adhere to the proletarian standpoint, and treat criticism seriously and meticulously, regarding criticizing others as a process of self-transformation, rather than adapting ourselves to the thought of the hostile class. Otherwise, before Thaïs sees the "kingdom of heaven," we ourselves will go knocking on the gates of hell. Chen Yong is a negative "teacher" for us.

### 想起了泰绮思的故事

　　想起了泰绮思的故事
　　唐弢
    说起来已经是很熟悉的故事了，然而偏有人没有从这里接受教训，老是重演着前人已经讲过的情节。
    亚诺托尔·法朗士写过一本小说，述说一个正在修行的僧人，忽然想到亚历山大府的名妓泰绮思，觉得这是一个蛊惑青年、贻害世道的尤物，为了积些功德，也为了挽救泰绮思和被她蛊惑的青年，决计去感化她。他用了很大力气才把泰绮思说服，这个妓女毁掉在俗时的衣饰，出家了。可是事情并没有完。僧人回到原来的地方，继续修行时，却再也安定不下来，闭上眼睛，立刻看到妖怪，看到裸体女人，白天黑夜一直神魂颠倒，他急遁，远行，都没有效。许多人又总是向他礼拜、祈祷，称颂他的道行，他心里有苦说不出，最后还是跑到泰绮思那里去，摊开双臂，叫道：“我的好人儿，我爱你。”不料泰绮思却自说已经看到天国，不久就断气了。
    我反对弗洛伊德精神分析学，因此并不同意法朗士小说主题所暗示的结论。我只想借用这个故事，来说明反党分子陈涌堕落的经过。当1955年批判反革命分子胡风的文艺思想时，陈涌曾经以“勇士”的姿态，对胡风的反动文艺思想进行鞭挞。曾几何时，胡风的阴魂却附在陈涌的身上，这位“勇士”竟把他所批判的敌对的观点全盘接收过来，装入自己的脑袋里：胡风反对党对文艺的领导，主张取消作家协会，陈涌也反对党的文艺路线，反对作协对创作的领导。胡风反对思想改造，强调创作实践，陈涌也反对作家参加政治活动，认为通过艺术实践可以改造思想。胡风主张到处有生活，作家不必到工农兵中去，陈涌也反对描写工农兵，认为题材没有什么差别，深入生活不一定能写出好作品。胡风把延安文艺座谈会以后所取得的成就，一笔抹煞，陈涌也否定成绩，夸大缺点，把人民喜闻乐见的作品一一加以枪毙。总之，今天的陈涌，已经成为当时被批判的胡风，很难从他们中间看出什么区别来。这就使我想起了法朗士笔下的故事。当然，一切比喻都是蹩脚的，泰绮思并不一定就是坏人，胡风并没有像泰绮思一样“出家”，出胡风自己的反革命的家，更不会看到“天国”，社会主义的天国。不过陈涌的着魔倒是实在的，当他朝着胡风大叫“我爱你”时，这回却是胡风摊开双臂，说道：“来?！”他们就在反党的基础上双双拥抱，一齐堕落了。
    这就是全部事实的真相。
    为什么会有这样的结果呢？法朗士用弗洛伊德学说来解释这种现象，那是错误的。撇开泰绮思不谈，以眼前的事实而论，“僧人”陈涌和“妓女”胡风之间，本来就存在着一个共同的东西，陈涌的“道行”是虚假的，伪善的，他的主要毛病是“六根未净”，思想深处还是以个人为中心的资产阶级腐朽的文艺观点。就像1955年冯雪峰批判胡风，只好“撕了又写，写了又撕”，终于一个字都没有写成一样，陈涌虽然纵马上阵，却不过虚掩几枪，在胡风的“五把刀子”里照见了自己的灵魂，投降了。
    我们在这里还可以指出：陈涌之所以与冯雪峰嗅味相投，引为“知己”，最后参加他的反党活动，除了别的原因外，其中之一就是因为雪峰的思想和胡风是互相纠结着的。用雪峰自己的话来说，“不知道究竟是我影响了胡风，还是胡风影响了我。”他们所散发的腥臭是一致的，陈涌就是在这点——也即反党的基础上和他们一拍即合。物以类聚，信夫信夫。
    知识分子中间“六根未净”的情况还是相当普遍的，因此我并不是说，我们自己必须是一个不折不扣的马克思主义者，才能批判别人，我是说，我们必须坚持真理，坚持无产阶级的立场，严肃细致地来对待批判工作，把批判别人同时看作是一个自我改造的过程，而不是使自己去适应敌对阶级的思想。否则，泰绮思还没有看见“天国”，我们自己倒先去扣地狱之门了。陈涌就是我们一个反面的“教员”。
