　　In the mighty struggle to repulse the rightists, I, as a reporter, interviewed and contacted many engineering and technical personnel, government cadres, and housewives. These ordinary people, who usually don't pay much attention to politics, have now become active defenders of the socialist cause.

Old Engineer Refutes Rightists with Reason
　　Hu Beisan, a 65-year-old engineer from the Coal Mine Administration of the Henan Industrial Department, had just returned from inspecting work in several mining areas, braving heavy rain and riding livestock. As soon as he entered the gate of the office building, he saw big-character posters everywhere. He stopped in front of the posters for a long time, initially confused, then extremely angry. He had always thought that Fan Ningfang was one of the youngest and most talented engineers in the bureau, but according to the revelations in the big-character posters, Fan Ningfang was maliciously attacking the Party's leadership, slandering that "the Communist Party cannot lead technology at all," "the section chiefs and bureau chiefs are all laymen," and "the new China is not as good as the old China." When the old engineer saw this, he was furious and went to the leading comrades that night, insisting on reasoning with Fan Ningfang.

　　This old engineer usually did not concern himself with politics, and his anger surprised many people in the bureau.

　　The old engineer has been engaged in mining work for thirty-five years, including twenty-five years in Henan. He knows the changes in Henan's coal industry before and after liberation like the back of his hand. At the rally for reasoning and struggle, he questioned Fan Ningfang: "Before liberation, the largest Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan used old-fashioned mining methods, and the welfare facilities for workers were almost non-existent. Now it is fully mechanized, and there are workers' bathhouses, canteens, barber shops, clubs, cinemas, nurseries, schools, shops, etc. I have seen these changes with my own eyes. Can you cover them up? As for the Communist Party leaders in the bureau, you and I should be ashamed. They don't understand, but they are willing to learn diligently. The deputy director of the Yima New Well Preparatory Office used to beg for food when he was a child and had never gone to school. Recently, he led workers to build a pair of medium-sized mines on schedule. When I went to inspect, the quality was very good. Our director, Wen Xiaoting, didn't know many characters originally, but now he can raise technical and theoretical questions at business meetings that engineers can't raise. Faced with these countless facts, I have always been deeply moved by them, but why can't you see them?" Under the old engineer's rebuttal with ironclad facts, the rightist Fan Ningfang was embarrassed and speechless.

　　Recently, when I interviewed this old engineer, he told me: "My lifelong wish is to dedicate my technology to the country, but before liberation, this was not possible. After liberation, the country's economic construction developed vigorously, and I had a place to use my talents, which made me very happy. I thought that as long as there was the Communist Party's leadership, I could ignore everything else and concentrate on my technical work. But these rightists are clearly lying through their teeth, trying to incite people's dissatisfaction with the Communist Party. If the knife were in the hands of these people, what would become of us? What technical work could I talk about then!" The old engineer also told me that his three children are all engineers and Communist Party members. He said, "I always felt that I was old and didn't consider joining the Party, but recently, for some reason, I keep thinking about joining the Party..."

"I and the Children Oppose You"

　　One evening, Wang Zhaomin, a family member of a Zhengzhou Railway Bureau staff member, was preparing dinner when her son, Pan Shu, and daughter, Pan Li, rushed home from outside to tell her that their father, Pan Wenshan, was a rightist and that the radio station was broadcasting it. Wang Zhaomin had participated in several discussion meetings about rightists in the reading group. Upon hearing that her husband was a rightist, she was so angry that she trembled all over. That night, she ignored her husband, feeling hateful and ashamed. She secretly slipped out to find the chairman of the trade union, asking him to help her come up with an idea, asking him: She is a housewife and illiterate, how should she help her husband confess his guilt?

　　The next day, she still prepared a suitable breakfast for Pan Wenshan. When she had just put the tomato and egg noodles in front of Pan Wenshan, she almost burst into tears. She said: "Lao Pan, how did you become a rightist? Do you have no conscience? Have you forgotten that before liberation, your monthly salary could only buy thirty fried dough sticks, and the family was crammed into a dilapidated shack, eating inadequately and not being able to keep warm all year round, and the children were crying from hunger? I have been with you for decades, and haven't I tasted any suffering? Now you earn more than ninety yuan a month, live in three tile-roofed houses, four children, one in high school, two in junior high school, and one in elementary school. You say the Communist Party is not good, you say the lives of the workers have not improved, can you be worthy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao? Do you still expect the bitter days of the past? No way! Lao Pan, I and the children will oppose you." Pan Wenshan lowered his head and said nothing, and did not dare to face his wife's righteous gaze. As he left, he said softly: "I am examining and confessing."

　　After this, Wang Zhaomin leaned against the gate almost every evening, and the first thing she asked Pan Wenshan when she saw him was: "How did your confession go today?" At night, after the children were asleep, Pan Wenshan sat under the light writing a self-criticism, and Wang Zhaomin anxiously sat beside him urging him. She said to Pan Wenshan: "Lao Pan, your mistake is very big! You are telling lies against your conscience, you are letting everyone down. Our children are all good students at school. After hearing that you are a rightist, they haven't eaten properly for several days. Look how thin Pan Li has become. You must not make mistakes again and again and ruin this family. How could this family have what it has today if it weren't for the Communist Party?"

　　Now, after reasoning and struggle from all sides, the rightist Pan Wenshan has bowed his head and confessed his guilt.

### 在反击右派的斗争中

　　在反击右派的斗争中
　　新华社记者　陈健
    在声势磅礴的反击右派的斗争中，记者访问和接触过不少工程技术人员、机关干部和家庭主妇。这些普通的、甚至平时不大过问政治的人，如今都成了捍卫社会主义事业的积极分子。
  老工程师据理斥右派
    河南工业厅煤矿管理局六十五岁的老工程师胡备三，冒着暴雨，骑着牲口，刚从下边几个矿区检查工作回来，一进机关大门就看到楼上楼下满是大字报。他在大字报前停留许久，开始有点迷惑，继而十分气愤。他过去一直认为范凝钫是局里最年青最有才干的工程师之一，可是根据大字报的揭露，范凝钫竟然恶毒地攻击党的领导，污蔑说：“共产党根本不能领导技术”，“局里的科、局长都是外行”，“新中国不如旧中国好”。老工程师看到这里，怒不可止，当晚就找领导同志，一定要和范凝钫讲理。
    这位老工程师平时不问政治，他的愤怒使局里不少人感到惊讶。
    老工程师从事采矿工作已经有三十五年了，光在河南就二十五年。河南煤矿事业解放前后的变化，他了如指掌。在说理斗争的大会上，他质问范凝钫说：“河南最大的焦作煤矿，在解放前，采煤方法全部是旧式的，工人的福利设备几乎等于零，现在全部机械化了，而且有了工人的浴室、食堂、理发店、俱乐部、电影院、托儿所、学校、商店等，这些变化是我亲眼看见的，你能一手遮住吗？要说到局里共产党员领导干部，你我都得惭愧，人家不懂，可是肯用心学。义马新井筹备处的副主任，小时讨过饭，没上过学。最近他领导工人按期建设了一对中型矿井，我去检查时，质量很好。咱们的局长温小庭，原来识字不多，可是现在他已经可以在业务会议上，提出工程师们不能提出的技术理论问题了。面对着这些说不尽的事实，我一向都深深地为它所激动，而你为什么看不见呢？”右派分子范凝钫在老工程师的铁的事实驳斥下，狼狈万状，哑口无言。
    最近记者访问这位老工程师时，他告诉我说：“我一生的愿望，是把技术献给国家，可是解放前，这路行不通。解放后，国家的经济建设，蓬勃发展了，我自己有了用武之地，心情很愉快。我想，只要有共产党领导，自己什么都可以不过问，一心一意干我的技术工作好了，可是，这些右派分子明明是睁着眼说瞎话，想煽起人们对共产党不满。你想，要是刀把握到他们这帮人的手中，还有咱过的？我还谈什么技术工作呢！”老工程师还告诉我，他的三个孩子都是工程师、共产党员。他说：“我呢，过去一向都觉着自己老了，不考虑入党了，可是最近，不知怎的，我老想着入党这件事……”。
    “我和孩子都反对你”
    一个傍晚，郑州铁路管理局的职员家属王兆敏正在做晚饭，儿子潘漱，女儿潘俐匆忙从外边跑回家告诉她，爸爸潘文山是个右派，广播站正在广播。王兆敏在读报组里参加过好几次关于右派分子的讨论会，一听说自己的丈夫是右派，气得混身直打哆嗦。这天晚上，她没理丈夫，觉着可恨，羞耻。她偷偷地溜出去找工会主席，请他帮忙出主意，问他：自己是个家庭妇女，不识字，究竟该怎样帮助丈夫认罪。
    第二天，她照样给潘文山准备了一顿合适的早餐，当她把西红柿鸡蛋面刚端到潘文山面前时，忍不住几乎失声哭出来。她说：“老潘呀，你怎么成了右派？你没良心吗？你忘记解放前，你一月的工资只能买三十根油条，一家几口挤在一间破草屋里，整年吃不饱，穿不暖，孩子饿的直哭吗？我跟着你几十年，啥滋味没尝过。现在你每月九十多元，住三间瓦房，四个孩子一个高中、两个初中、一个小学。你说共产党不好，说职工的生活没提高，能对得起共产党、毛主席吗？难道你还盼望过去的苦日子吗？不成啊！老潘，我和孩子都要反对你。”潘文山低着头不说一句话，也不敢正视妻子正义的眼光。临走时，细声说：“我正在检查交代。”
    这以后，王兆敏几乎每天傍晚都倚在大门口，见到潘文山第一句话就问：“今天交代得怎样？”晚上，孩子们都睡了，潘文山坐在灯下写检讨，王兆敏就焦急的坐在一边督促着。她对潘文山说：“老潘你的错误很大呀！昧着良心说瞎话，你对不起所有的人，咱们的孩子在学校都是好学生，听说你是右派，几天都不好好吃饭，你看潘俐都瘦了，你千万不能一错再错，毁了这个家，这家要不是共产党怎么会有今天呢？”
    现在，经过各方面的说理斗争，右派分子潘文山已经低头认罪了。
