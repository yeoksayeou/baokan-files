Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th. The Second Shandong Province Salt Industry Advanced Producers Representative Conference, which concluded yesterday, passed a resolution: To adopt all effective measures to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the province's 1957 salt production plan.

In the first eight months of this year, Shandong Province has produced 538,521 tons of salt, completing 80.98% of the annual plan, an increase of 62.66% compared to the same period last year.

The 123 representatives attending the meeting stated that they must continue their efforts to complete the remaining 200,000 tons (including 75,000 tons of increased production) of the salt production task during the autumn production period. They are determined to motivate all employees and cooperative members to tap the potential for increased production in all aspects, not wasting an inch of salt field or missing a minute of favorable weather, and strive to produce more brine and more salt. At the same time, in order to ensure that salt-making raw materials are not severely damaged by rain and snow, after the end of the autumn production, they will also take the lead in doing a good job in brine storage, adding brine storage equipment, and generally achieving more brine production and better brine preservation, to lay the foundation for realizing a bumper harvest of sea salt throughout the province next year.

The conference also exchanged comprehensive advanced experiences in crystallization, "Fu-shai" (a type of salt production), and running advanced salt industry cooperatives.

    山东盐业先进生产者
    力争食盐增产
    新华社济南7日电　昨天结束的山东省盐业第二次先进生产者代表会议作出决议：要采取一切有效措施保证提前和超额完成1957年全省产盐计划。
    今年头八个月，山东全省已经产盐五十三万八千五百二十一吨，完成全年计划的80.98％，比去年同期实产增加62.66％。
    参加会议的一百二十三名代表表示，对还没有完成的二十万吨（包括七万五千吨增产部分）的产盐任务，一定要再接再厉，在秋产期间力争完成。他们决心带动全体职工、社员，从各方面挖掘增产潜力，不浪费一寸盐田、不放过一分钟的有利天时，力争多制一方卤水、多产一担盐。同时，为了确保制盐原料不因雨雪侵袭而造成大量损耗，在秋产结束以后，还要带头搞好储卤工作，增添储卤设备，普遍作到制卤多、保卤好，为实现明年全省海盐大丰收奠定基础。
    会议还交流了结晶、伏晒，以及办好高级盐业社等方面的综合先进经验。
