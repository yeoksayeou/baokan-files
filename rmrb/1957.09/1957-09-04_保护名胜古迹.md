Protect Scenic Spots and Historical Sites
Hua Gu Pagoda of Song Dynasty and Zhenru Temple of Yuan Dynasty Have Been Restored Successively

In recent years, some important cultural relics and historical sites in Shanghai, such as the Longhua Gu Pagoda (Song Dynasty architecture), the Zhenru Temple (Yuan Dynasty), the Tomb of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Martyrs, the Dacheng Hall of the Confucian Temple, and the Qianye Guild Hall, have been restored successively. Since the beginning of this year, the work of protecting cultural relics and historical sites has made even greater progress.

The Zhenru Temple of the Yuan Dynasty (locally known as the "Da Miao," its predecessor was the Wanshou Temple, renamed Zhenru Temple during the Jiading period of the Southern Song Dynasty, and moved to its current site in the seventh year of the Yanyou period of the Yuan Dynasty, with a history of 637 years) was repaired in 1951. Recently, due to water leakage from the roof of the temple and the tilting of the rear wall of the hall, another emergency repair was carried out.

The "Yu Garden" behind the Old City God Temple began renovation in September last year. Some parts have been repaired, some are being painted and decorated, and some have just completed the repair design drawings determined by experts and are about to start construction. Among them, the "Jade Exquisite Stone" at the former site of the Xiangxue Hall at Huanlong Bridge has remained in ruins for twenty years. In May and June of this year, the Municipal Bureau of Culture entrusted a flower company to plant many flowers and trees here to protect this famous stone of the Ming Dynasty.

This year, the Religious Affairs Bureau and the Buddhist Association have also repaired several famous ancient temples. The Jing'an Temple, founded during the Sun Quan era of the Three Kingdoms (the temple preserves cultural relics such as stone carvings from the Song Dynasty and bronze bells from the Ming Dynasty), has been renovated. The ancient Chenxiang Pavilion in the Ci Yun Chan Monastery (where a sandalwood Guanyin carved in the Ming Dynasty is enshrined) has also been repaired and restored to its original appearance. The Maitreya Hall, the Heavenly King Hall, and the Bell and Drum Tower of the Longhua Ancient Temple have all been thoroughly repaired after collapsing. Among them, two of the Four Heavenly Kings in the Heavenly King Hall were recast.

The tomb of Xu Guangqi, a scientist of the Ming Dynasty, was handed over to the state for protection by the Xu family. The Bureau of Culture immediately asked designers to draw up plans, and construction will begin this year.

The Imperial College and the Confucian Temple are Dressed in New Clothes
The White Cloud Temple is Being Rebuilt

Many ancient buildings in Beijing are being renovated and repainted. The Imperial College, the Confucian Temple, and the Fahai Temple, which have been in disrepair for decades, have been given a new look. The Fahai Temple has been opened after renovation.

The White Cloud Temple began reconstruction in February this year. The White Cloud Temple has a history of more than 1,200 years and is one of the largest and most famous ancient buildings in the country. This time, major renovations will be carried out on some houses, and the original paint and decorations will be restored.

This month, the Dazidian Hall, the Tibetan Hall, and the Wanfo Tower of the Zhihua Temple will also begin renovations.

In addition, learning from the historical lessons of ancient buildings being destroyed by lightning strikes, relevant government departments have installed lightning protection equipment in most of the famous ancient buildings in the city.

Hangzhou is Renovating a Batch of West Lake Scenic Spots and Historical Sites

The Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Gardens and Parks has recently begun to renovate a batch of scenic spots and historical sites around West Lake.

The larger renovation projects include the archway and houses near the Broken Bridge. These two places have been tilting due to years of disrepair. After the typhoon last year, they were temporarily reinforced. This time, the archway will be renovated, and the houses will be demolished and rebuilt. Many of the marble walls of the Northern Expedition Martyrs Memorial Tower at the Renhe Road intersection of the Lakeside have collapsed and are being reorganized. The Baopu Cottage and Yangxin Cottage in Geling will also be renovated. In addition, the Qizhong Temple in Yue Temple, the small pavilion on the mountainside of North Peak, and the newly built thatched pavilions on Su Causeway will also be repaired successively.

In addition, the area along Su Causeway - Xizhao Mountain will be afforested. The afforestation project covers an area of about fifteen acres, and two pebble garden roads are planned to be built. A three-hole arched bamboo bridge will be built along the lake, spanning the Jingci Port, connecting the Xizhao Mountain scenic area. (Attached pictures)

    保护名胜古迹
    宋代华古塔、元代真如寺已先后修复
    近几年来，上海一些重要文物古迹如宋代建筑龙华古塔、元代的真如寺、太平天国烈士墓、文庙大成殿以及钱业会馆等，都先后修复。今年以来，保护文物古迹工作更有进展。
    元代的真如寺（当地人称大庙，它的前身是万寿寺，南宋嘉定年间改名真如寺，元延祐七年迁移现址，距今已有六百三十七年历史），1951年曾加修葺，近因寺顶漏水，殿后墙壁有倾斜现象，所以最近又抢修了一次。
    老城隍庙后的“豫园”，去年9月开始修葺，现在有些已经修好；有些正在粉饰髹漆；还有些刚刚完成了经专家研究确定的修理设计图样，即将动工。其中环龙桥堍香雪堂故址上的“玉玲珑”石，二十年来一直残留在废墟旁，今年5、6月间由市文化局委托花木公司在此种了许多花木，把这块明代的名石保护下来。
    今年，宗教局和佛教协会也修理了几处有名古刹。三国孙权时代创立的静安寺（寺内保存着宋代石刻、明代铜钟等文物），已修葺一新。慈云禅院内的古老沉香阁（供奉着明代雕刻沉香观音），也已经过修葺，恢复旧观。龙华古寺的弥勒殿、天王殿、钟鼓楼都在坍塌情况下加以彻底修理。其中天王殿内的四大金刚还重塑了两个。
    明代科学家徐光启墓，自从由徐氏族人交给国家保护后，文化局即请设计师制订图样，年内就要开工修缮。
    国子监、孔庙都穿上新装
    白云观正在重修
    北京的许多古建筑物正在进行修缮和重新油漆彩画。失修几十年的国子监、孔庙和法海寺都已穿上新装。法海寺在修缮之后已经开放。
    白云观在今年2月开工重修。白云观有一千二百多年历史，是全国最大、最有名的古建筑之一。这次对部分房屋进行大翻修，并恢复原来的油漆彩画。
    这个月，智化寺的大字殿、藏殿、万佛楼等处也将动工修缮。
    此外，接受历史上常有古建筑物被雷击毁的教训，政府有关部门已在全市著名的大部分古建筑物安装了避雷设备。
    杭州整修一批西湖名胜古迹
    杭州市园林管理局最近开始整修一批西湖名胜古迹。
    这次整修工程较大的有断桥畔的牌亭和房屋，这两处因年久失修，已呈倾斜，去年台风后曾临时加固一下，这次牌亭将翻修，房屋也将拆除重建。湖滨仁和路口的北伐阵亡将士纪念塔，四壁大理石倒塌甚多，正在重新整理。葛岭的抱朴庐和养心庐，也要翻修。还有岳庙内的启忠祠、北高峰半山的小亭以及苏堤新建茅亭等处也将陆续开工修理。
    此外，苏堤——夕照山沿湖还将绿化。绿化工程面积约有十五亩左右，还准备建筑两条弹石园路，并将在临湖建造一座三孔拱形竹桥，横跨净慈港，接通夕照山风景区。（附图片）
