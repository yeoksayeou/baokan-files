Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: New York - Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations Security Council unreasonably rejected on the 9th the Soviet proposal to recommend that the General Assembly admit the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations. The Soviet Union and Sweden voted in favor of the Soviet proposal, while the United States, Colombia, Cuba, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique voted against it. The United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Iraq abstained.

In his statement on the issue, Soviet representative Sobolev said that the motive behind the West's refusal to consider Mongolia's application was the hope of not admitting a country that had established a regime unwelcome to certain countries, which is inconsistent with the UN Charter.

The Security Council also rejected on the 9th a proposal to recommend that the General Assembly admit South Korea as a member of the United Nations. Ten Council members voted in favor, but the proposal failed to pass due to the Soviet Union's veto as a permanent member.

During the discussion, US representative Lodge tried his best to advocate for the admission of South Korea, saying that the South Korean regime of Syngman Rhee was "flesh and blood of the United States." This US suggestion was opposed by the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out that South Korea's application has become complicated due to the current state of division in Korea.

The Soviet delegation proposed an amendment to the Western proposal, arguing that the Security Council should recommend the simultaneous admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea as member states, but this amendment was also rejected.

The Security Council meeting that day also failed to pass the recommendation on admitting South Vietnam as a member of the United Nations. Ten delegations voted in favor of the recommendation, while the Soviet Union opposed it.

In his statement, Soviet representative Sobolev said that if the Security Council discusses South Vietnam's application, it would only encourage the South Vietnamese authorities to continue obstructing consultations on the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Soviet delegation proposed an amendment arguing that the Security Council should not discuss the admission of South Vietnam to the United Nations before the issue of Vietnamese unification is resolved, but this amendment was also rejected by the West.

　　安理会在美国操纵下
　　拒绝接纳蒙古加入联合国
　　苏联否决接纳南朝鲜和南越的提案
    据新华社10日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会9日无理拒绝了苏联提出的建议大会接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的提案。赞成苏联提案的有苏联和瑞典，反对的有美国、哥伦比亚、古巴、菲律宾、蒋介石分子，弃权的有英国、澳大利亚、法国和伊拉克。
    苏联代表索波列夫就这个问题发言时说，西方拒绝考虑蒙古人民共和国的申请的动机，是希望不接纳一个建立了不为某些国家欢迎的政权的国家，这是不符合联合国宪章的。 
    安全理事会9日还否决了建议大会接纳南朝鲜为联合国会员国的提案。在投票时，有十个理事国赞成，但是由于常任理事国苏联投票反对，这项提案没有通过。
    在讨论时，美国代表洛奇竭力要求接纳南朝鲜，并且说南朝鲜李承晚政权是“美国的骨肉”。美国这个建议遭到苏联的反对。苏联代表索波列夫指出，由于朝鲜现在处在分裂状态，南朝鲜的申请变得复杂起来。
    苏联代表团对西方的提案提出了一项修正案，主张安全理事会建议同时接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜为会员国，但是这项修正案也被否决。
    安全理事会这一天会议也没有通过关于接纳南越为联合国会员国的建议。十个代表团赞成通过这个建议，苏联反对。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言时说，如果在安全理事会讨论南越的申请，那只会鼓励南越当局继续阻挠关于执行日内瓦会议协议的协商。苏联代表团提出了一项修正案，主张安全理事会在越南统一问题解决以前不讨论接纳南越加入联合国的问题，但是这个修正案也遭到西方的否决。
