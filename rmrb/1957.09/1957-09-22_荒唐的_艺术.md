Such is the “Free World”

Absurd "Art"
Recently, Western newspapers have once again exposed two absurd examples of Western "art appreciation."

It is said that a student at the British Royal Academy of Arts often sells works with bizarre patterns. Some time ago, he revealed his special painting technique: he first spreads a large piece of white canvas on the floor, pours oil paint and ink on it, dances or hops around on the oil paint, and then rides a bicycle around on the oil paint. Finally, he sprinkles some fine sand on the painting, and then it's done.

Not long ago, the organizers of an art exhibition in Los Angeles, USA, received a phone call saying that the author of the work signed "Laja" at the exhibition was not a person, but a one-eyed parrot. Miss Poweris, Laja's agent, had to admit under questioning that her parrot had painted more than 700 watercolors and an oil painting, which she fraudulently signed with Laja's name. After these paintings appeared on the market, they received rave reviews from American art critics.

    荒唐的“艺术”
    最近西方报刊又揭露了两个关于西方“艺术欣赏”的荒唐事例。
    据说，英国皇家艺术学院一个学生经常出卖一些画着奇奇怪怪图案的作品。前些时，他透露了他那一套特别的绘画技术：原来他是先把一大块白帆布铺在地板上，往上面倒油彩和墨，在油彩上跳舞或蹦蹦跳跳，然后骑着自行车在油彩上面兜圈子。最后，再在画面上撒些细沙，于是就大功告成了。
    不久前，美国洛杉矶一个美术展览会的组织者，接到一个电话，说展览会上署名腊贾的作品的作者不是人，而是一只独眼鹦鹉。腊贾的代理人泡厄里斯小姐在追问下，不得不承认，她的鹦鹉已经画了七百多幅水彩画和一幅油画，而由她冒名签上腊贾的名字。这些画在市面上出现后得到了美国美术批评家的交口称赞。
