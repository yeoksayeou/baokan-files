　　China's Largest Coke Oven Built
　　Coke By-Product Recovery Workshop Simultaneously Put Into Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th – China's current largest coke oven – the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's new No. 1 coke oven – began production yesterday. At 1:30 PM yesterday, the first batch of high-quality coke was produced.
    This coke oven was constructed using modernized Soviet design blueprints, with the main equipment manufactured by domestic factories. It takes approximately two hours less to produce a batch of coke than a general coke oven.
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th – Another coke by-product recovery workshop at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company was completed and put into production yesterday.
    If 100 tons of coal are put into the coke oven, in addition to producing 75 tons of coke, the remaining coal smoke enters this automated coke by-product recovery workshop, which can also produce 35,000 cubic meters of coal gas, more than one ton of ammonium sulfate fertilizer, more than four tons of coal tar, and more than one ton of crude benzene. These can be made into more than 20 kinds of chemical industrial raw materials such as refined benzene, naphthalene, and cresol. The nylon factories that China will build can also obtain a large amount of raw materials from here.
    In the past four years, Anshan Iron and Steel has newly built and renovated three coke by-product recovery workshops according to plan. The ammonium sulfate produced by these workshops each year is enough to fertilize six million mu of cotton fields once.

　　我国最大的炼焦炉建成
　　炼焦副产品回收车间同时投入生产
    新华社鞍山16日电　我国目前最大的炼焦炉——鞍山钢铁公司新一号炼焦炉昨天开始生产。昨天下午一时半炼制出第一批质量优良的焦炭。
    这座炼焦炉是采用苏联近代化的设计图纸建设的，主要设备都系国内工厂制造，它炼一炉焦炭的时间比一般炼焦炉缩短两小时左右。
    新华社鞍山16日电　鞍山钢铁公司昨天又有一座炼焦副产品回收车间建成，投入生产。
    如果拿一百吨煤放到炼焦炉里，除了可以炼成七十五吨焦炭以外，剩下的煤烟进入这个自动化装备的炼焦副产品回收车间，还可以产生煤气三万五千立方公尺、硫安肥田粉一吨多、焦油四吨、粗?一吨多，可以制成精?、荼、色恩等二十多种化学工业用的原料，我国将要建设的尼龙工厂，也可以从这里得到大量原料。
    在过去四年中，鞍钢已按计划新建和改建了三座炼焦副产品回收车间。这些车间每年仅生产的硫安，就够六百万亩棉田施肥一次。
