    Gansu Province Non-Party Senior Intellectuals
    A large number of activists emerge in the struggle
    A group of activists has emerged from the non-Party senior intellectuals in Gansu Province during the anti-Rightist struggle.

    In seven units, including Lanzhou University, Northwest University for Nationalities, Yumen Oilfield, and the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, approximately 180 activists have emerged after being tempered in the anti-Rightist struggle. Liu Youcheng, a professor in the Chemistry Department of Lanzhou University, immediately posted a big-character poster opposing personal attacks and abuse when Rightist elements in the school posted big-character posters scolding Party member leading cadres during the Great Blooming and Contending, and incited students to petition in Beijing. He also dissuaded some students from unreasonable actions. When Rightist elements opposed the Communist Party's leadership over the school and proposed "professors governing the school," he refuted this ulterior motive from all aspects and resolutely advocated the Party committee system. After the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the anti-Rightist struggle committee in the school. At several conferences, he exposed many anti-Communist remarks and actions by Chen Shiwei, the vice-president of Lanzhou University and a Rightist element, and Chen's wife, Zuo Zong?, the Rightist element and director of the Chemistry Department, as well as the various slanders and attacks they carried out against him after their attempts to win him over failed. Zhang Aicheng, an associate professor in the Histology and Embryology Teaching and Research Group of Lanzhou Medical College, made some fair comments on some shortcomings in the work of the school's Communist Party organization during the Great Blooming and Contending, and was immediately opposed by Rightist elements in the school, who posted big-character posters slandering and scolding him, saying he was "shameful" and "shielding" the Party committee. After the People's Daily published the editorial "What is the Reason?", he saw the words and deeds of the Rightist elements more clearly and firmly stood his ground. When he launched a struggle against the Rightist elements, he also received an anonymous letter inciting him to doubt and be dissatisfied with the Party. Zhang Aicheng immediately handed this letter over to the school's Communist Party organization and expressed his determination to resolutely fight the Rightist elements. Tong Degong, the chief engineer of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, only focused on professional work in the past and did not pay much attention to politics. This time, during the Great Blooming and Contending, many of the poisonous arrows released by Zhang Zan, the deputy chief engineer and a Rightist element in the bureau, did not attract his attention. Later, when everyone exposed Zhang Zan's consistent crimes of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism, he gradually realized his previous political numbness and his erroneous views on Zhang Zan, actively participated in the struggle, and exposed Zhang Zan's Rightist remarks and actions that he knew about.

    Many activists among these non-Party senior intellectuals have further improved their class consciousness and actively requested to join the Communist Party after being tempered in the anti-Rightist struggle. (Xinhua News Agency)

    甘肃省非党高级知识分子
    在斗争中出现大批积极分子
    甘肃省非党高级知识分子在反右派斗争中出现了一批积极分子。
    在兰州大学、西北民族学院、玉门油矿、铁道部第一工程局等七个单位中，经过反右派斗争的锻炼，涌现出来的积极分子有一百八十名左右。兰州大学化学系教授刘有成，当大鸣大放中校内右派分子贴出大字报辱骂党员领导干部，并煽动学生去北京请愿时，他立刻贴出大字报反对人身攻击和谩骂，并劝阻有些学生的无理行动。当右派分子反对共产党对学校的领导，提出“教授治校”时，他从各方面驳斥了这个别有用心的论调，坚决主张党委制。反右派斗争开始后，他被选为校内的反右派斗争委员会副主席。在几次大会上他揭露了兰州大学副校长、右派分子陈时伟和陈的妻子、右派分子、化学系主任左宗?的许多反共言行，以及这两个右派分子拉拢他失败后对他进行的种种诬蔑、打击。兰州医学院组织与胚胎教研组副教授张爱诚，在大鸣大放中对学校中共组织在工作中的一些缺点提了些公正的意见，立即遭到了校内右派分子的反对，他们出大字报诽谤、辱骂他，说他“可耻”，“包庇”党委。当人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论后，他对右派分子的言行看得更加清楚，坚决站稳立场。当他对右派分子展开斗争的时候，还接到一封匿名信，煽动他对党怀疑和不满。张爱诚立即把这封信交给学校的中共组织，并表明自己坚决和右派分子斗争的决心。铁道部第一工程局主任工程师佟德功，过去只钻研业务，不大关心政治，这次大鸣大放中，局里的副总工程师、右派分子张瓒放出的许多毒箭，也没有引起他的注意。后来当大家揭露出张瓒一贯反共反社会主义的罪行时，他逐渐认识到自己以前在政治上的麻痹和对张瓒看法的错误，积极地参加斗争，把他知道的张瓒的右派言行揭露了出来。
    这些非党高级知识分子中的许多积极分子经过反右派斗争的锻炼，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，积极要求参加共产党。（新华社）
