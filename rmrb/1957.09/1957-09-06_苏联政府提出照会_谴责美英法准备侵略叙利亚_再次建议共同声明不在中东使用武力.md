Xinhua News Agency, September 5th dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet government delivered notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on September 3rd, again suggesting that they jointly issue a statement with the Soviet Union, condemning the use of force to resolve outstanding issues in the Middle East and refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of countries in the region. The note stated that this is the first step that should be taken to ease the situation in the Middle East.

As early as April 19th of this year, the Soviet government had already made this suggestion in a note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. However, the governments of these three countries replied to the Soviet government on June 11th, rejecting this suggestion. They attempted to prove that the main reason for the current tension in the Middle East is not due to these countries interfering in the internal affairs of countries in the region, but due to the conflict between Arab countries and Israel.

The note of the Soviet government of September 3rd, conveyed to the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, reiterated the views and positions of the Soviet government on the Middle East issue. The note once again stated that the policy of strength pursued by these three Western countries in the Middle East is the root cause of the tension in the region.

The Soviet government's note to the United States government pointed out that the US government's claim that the UN Charter already stipulates the principle of not resorting to force in resolving international disputes, and therefore there is no need to adopt a special declaration on condemning the use of force in the Middle East, is not sufficient as an excuse to reject the Soviet proposal. The note said: "As everyone knows, the existence of the UN Charter did not prevent Britain, France, and Israel from launching an armed attack on Egypt together, nor did it prevent the US government from blatantly threatening the use of force by holding military demonstrations with its Sixth Fleet due to the Jordan incident."

The note stated that the policies pursued by the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East of piecing together military blocs and interfering in the internal affairs of countries in the region have greatly exacerbated the situation in the Middle East and are constantly creating new sources of conflict that threaten peace and international security. The recently exposed anti-government conspiracy in Syria, organized by US officials, proves this. The note once again drew the attention of the US government to the dangerous consequences that such a policy (including the US government's stated intention in the note to draw countries in the region into various military blocs in the future) may cause.

In its note to the British government, the Soviet government pointed out that the British government has adopted a negative attitude towards the proposal to renounce the use of force in the Middle East, and it has not put forward any specific suggestions for normalizing the situation in the Middle East, but now it is using force in the recent events in Oman and Yemen.

Now Britain, the United States, and France are stepping up their war of nerves against Syria and preparing to take new joint actions against the Syrian Republic.

The note said that the Soviet government is concerned about the tension in the Middle East and believes that the main source of this tension is the policy of strength pursued by Britain, the United States, and France in the region, as well as the activities of the aggressive Baghdad Pact organization. It cannot agree with the British government's claim that the Baghdad Pact is defensive. In fact, the policy pursued by the contracting parties to this treaty harbors dangerous consequences for the cause of peace in the Middle East.

In its note to the French government, the Soviet government also pointed out that the main root of the tension in the Middle East is the policy of strength pursued by Western countries in the region. The note said that one should not use silence to circumvent the recent newspaper reports about the plan to establish a French-Israeli alliance against Arab countries. The Soviet government believes that concluding such a military alliance is to encourage those elements in the Israeli ruling group who are most hostile to Arab countries, which cannot but lead to a further deterioration of the situation in the Middle East.

In its notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, the Soviet government reiterated that, in order to prevent possible future conflicts and to generally improve the situation in the Middle East, the first step that the four major powers should take is to issue a statement condemning the use of force to resolve outstanding issues in the Middle East and renouncing interference in the internal affairs of countries in the region.

    苏联政府提出照会
    谴责美英法准备侵略叙利亚
    再次建议共同声明不在中东使用武力
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府3日照会美、英、法三国政府，再次建议它们同苏联共同发表声明，谴责使用武力来解决中近东地区悬而未决的问题并且放弃干涉这一地区的内政。照会认为，这是为缓和中近东局势所应该采取的第一个步骤。
    还在今年4月19日，苏联政府在给美、英、法政府的照会中就曾经提出了这一建议。可是，这三国政府6月11日复照苏联政府，拒绝这一建议。它们企图证明，目前中近东地区的紧张局势的主要原因不是由于这些国家干涉这一地区国家的内政，而是由于阿拉伯国家与以色列之间的冲突。
    经苏联外交部长葛罗米柯转交给美、英、法三国大使的苏联政府9月3日的照会，重申了苏联政府在中近东问题上的观点和主张。照会再次认为，这三个西方国家在中近东地区执行的实力地位政策，是这一地区局势紧张的根源。
    苏联政府给美国政府的照会指出，美国政府认为联合国宪章中已经规定了在解决国际争端中不诉诸武力的原则，因此没有必要再就谴责在中近东地区使用武力的问题通过专门的宣言，这一说法并不足以成为拒绝苏联建议的借口。照会说：“大家知道，联合国宪章的存在并没有阻止了英国、法国和以色列一起武装进攻埃及，也没有阻止了美国政府由于约旦事件而拿它的第六舰队举行军事示威，从而公然进行武力威胁。”
    照会说，美、英、法三国在中近东所奉行的拼凑军事集团和干涉这个地区国家的内政的政策，大大地加剧了中近东的局势，并且不断制造威胁和平和国际安全的新的冲突策源地。如不久前被揭露的由美国官员所组织的在叙利亚的反政府阴谋就证明了这一点。照会再一次提请美国政府注意这种政策（包括美国政府在照会中所表明的它打算在今后把这个地区的国家拉入各种军事集团的企图）可能引起的危险后果。
    苏联政府在给英国政府的照会中指出，英国政府对关于放弃在中近东使用武力的建议采取消极的态度，而它又没有提出任何使中近东局势正常化的具体建议，现在它在这次的阿曼和也门事件中却又使用武力。
    现在英国、美国和法国又加紧对叙利亚的神经战，并且准备对叙利亚共和国采取新的联合行动。
    照会说，苏联政府对中近东局势的紧张情况感到忧虑，认为造成这种紧张局势的主要根源是英、美、法三国在这个地区所执行的实力地位政策以及它们所建立的侵略性巴格达条约组织的活动。它决不能同意英国政府的所谓巴格达条约是防御性的说法。因为，事实上，这个条约的缔约国所执行的政策对中近东的和平事业包藏着危险的后果。
    苏联政府在给法国政府的照会中也指出，中近东紧张局势的主要根源是西方国家在这个地区所执行的实力地位政策。照会说，不应该用缄默来规避最近报纸报道的关于建立反对阿拉伯国家的法国—以色列联盟的计划。苏联政府认为，缔结这种具有军事性质的联盟，就是鼓励以色列统治集团中最仇视阿拉伯国家的那些分子，这不能不导致中近东地区的局势更趋恶化。
    苏联政府在给美、英、法三国政府的照会中都再次建议，为了防止将来可能发生的冲突和使中近东地区的局势普遍好转，四大国所应采取的第一个步骤就是发表声明，谴责使用武力解决中近东悬而未决的问题并且放弃干涉这个地区国家的内政。
