Mobilize the Entire Party to Strive for the Complete Defeat of the Rightists
Summary of a Report at the National Revolutionary Committee's Party Rectification Work Conference
Li Jishen

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, delivered a report entitled "Mobilize the Entire Party to Strive for the Complete Defeat of the Rightists" at the National Revolutionary Committee's Party Rectification Work Conference held on the 16th.

In his report, Li Jishen first outlined the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle across the country. The report pointed out: The current anti-Rightist struggle being carried out nationwide is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This is a serious struggle related to the survival of our country and nation. Now that this struggle has been fully launched and is gradually deepening, the Rightists have been severely attacked by the people of the whole country and are beginning to collapse.

Li Jishen then said: The activities of the Rightists within the National Revolutionary Committee are very serious. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 807 Rightists have been exposed within the party. The core members among them were reactionary figures in power who were accustomed to manipulating events and engaging in intrigues in the past. They used their reactionary political experience to carry out activities with a program, a plan, and an organization, with the ultimate goal of subverting the people's regime, restoring reactionary rule, and re-enslaving the people.

Li Jishen emphasized: The rampant activities of the National Revolutionary Committee Rightists, and the ability of Rightist political influence to have an effect on many members, have their historical roots and social foundation. The social foundation of the Kuomintang reactionaries was the feudal class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. The members of the National Revolutionary Committee mainly came from the differentiation of this reactionary class. Some of them had the characteristics of the national bourgeoisie and, sooner or later, accepted the leadership and influence of the Chinese Communist Party and participated in the democratic revolution; a few others became revolutionary intellectuals. Another part was forced to temporarily cooperate with the revolutionary forces due to the internal contradictions of the reactionary ruling class. In addition, there were a considerable number of former Kuomintang military and political personnel who turned to the people and joined the National Revolutionary Committee only after the victory of the People's Liberation War. Among the above-mentioned people, those who consistently supported the revolutionary program put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and resolutely fought for it during the democratic revolutionary war period and after the founding of the People's Republic of China are Leftists. The Rightists are the opposite of the Leftists. They are unwilling to accept the leadership of the Communist Party, refuse to carry out self-reform, and have always held a hostile attitude towards the new country and society; they fundamentally muddled through the two major tests of the Liberation War and the land reform. In between the Left and Right are the centrists. They either agree with or resist the program put forward by the Communist Party. Although their position is inevitably wavering, they are still willing to move forward with the times in the basic direction. The above is the political division of Left, Center, and Right among the members of the National Revolutionary Committee in the democratic revolution stage.

In the stage of socialist revolution, due to the fundamental changes in class relations, the members of the National Revolutionary Committee showed a new political division. Some people politically abandoned the capitalist stance and turned to the working class stance, resolutely supporting socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party, becoming Leftists. This Leftist faction was gradually formed and developed in the process of socialist transformation. Some of them developed from the Leftists in the democratic revolution stage, and some were transformed from the centrists at that time. There are still not many such people now. With the victorious development of the anti-Rightist struggle, the Leftist ranks will gradually grow stronger. However, among the Leftists in the democratic revolution stage, some became centrists when passing the socialist test, and a few even became Rightists.

The majority of centrists, on the one hand, tend to accept socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party. After several years of social reform practice and study, they have taken a step in the long journey of transformation from the capitalist stance to the working class stance and can continue to accept transformation and move forward. However, on the other hand, they have basically not abandoned the capitalist stance, and they always have many reservations about socialism and serving the workers and peasants; they always feel out of place in the new society. Because the centrists have such a dual nature in their political stance, when the Rightists launch a frenzied attack, the negative side of the centrists is inevitably used by the Rightists, and they sympathize with and support the Rightists. After more than three months of exposing and criticizing the criminal words and deeds of the Rightists, more and more people among the centrists have begun to wake up. They have gradually realized that only by accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and taking the socialist road can they have a bright future, and they are transforming to the Left. However, as of now, there are still some centrists, especially those who are more to the Right, who have not been able to free themselves from the political influence of the Rightists. They hold skeptical and resistant attitudes towards the anti-Rightist struggle, and some even want to defend the Rightists. This not only hinders their own progress, but also forms a relatively significant problem in the National Revolutionary Committee's anti-Rightist struggle.

The Rightists adhere to the capitalist stance, oppose socialism, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and refuse to reform. Some are still unwilling to accept the demise of the feudal class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and harbor deep hatred for the new society. Historically, these Rightists were either Rightists in the democratic revolution stage, or reactionary elements newly brought into the National Revolutionary Committee organization, or some people who advocated taking the middle road in the democratic revolution stage and have not changed their original stance to this day. In the final analysis, all bourgeois Rightists are essentially reactionaries, and the Rightists of the National Revolutionary Committee are mostly old hands at opposing the Communist Party and the people.

Li Jishen then described the anti-Communist and anti-Soviet activities of Rightists such as Long Yun, Chen Mingshu, Huang Shaohong, and Tan Tiwu. He pointed out: The Rightists of the National Revolutionary Committee Central Committee and various localities formed an army during the frenzied attack of the bourgeois Rightists. Their main characteristic is the attempt to restore the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The Rightists of the National Revolutionary Committee have always attempted to turn the National Revolutionary Committee organization into a tool for realizing their political ambitions. For many years, a struggle between two lines has been going on within the National Revolutionary Committee in terms of political direction and organizational principles. This struggle is often reflected in the successive national congresses, central plenary sessions, and various meetings, as well as the specific implementation of work. For some major issues, the organization has already made correct resolutions, but the Rightists have played double-dealing tactics, pretending to comply but acting in opposition, and even arbitrarily sabotaging and going against the grain. During the period of "blooming and contending," the Rightists of the National Revolutionary Committee took the opportunity to launch an unprecedentedly frenzied attack; this not only endangers our country's socialist cause, but also caused a serious political crisis for the National Revolutionary Committee. All comrades who are willing to resolutely follow the Communist Party on the bright road of socialism must not allow the Rightists to lead the National Revolutionary Committee to a dead end!

Li Jishen then said: Our party's current serious political task is to completely defeat the Rightists, raise the political awareness of all members in the struggle, further transform our position, prepare our party for a general rectification, and lay the foundation for the fundamental transformation of our party.

We must:

I. Completely defeat the Rightists. From the Central Committee to all grassroots organizations, the criminal activities of the Rightists must be fully exposed in front of the broad masses, and their reactionary remarks must be refuted thoroughly, completely exposing their ugly faces. Over the past three months, the conspiracies of the Rightists have been greatly exposed, and the vast majority of members have begun to open their eyes, actively joining the battle, either exposing crimes or refuting fallacies. Under the reasoned and powerful resolute attacks of the masses, some Rightists have been left speechless and have had to bow their heads and admit their guilt; some have begun to feel that they are at the end of their rope and have had to reconsider their way out; and there are still some who are stubborn and attempt to continue to resist; in addition, there are many hidden Rightists who are being actively exposed by the masses. The anti-Rightist struggle is deepening and expanding and must be carried through to the end, and must never be abandoned halfway or concluded hastily. Here we want to warn the Rightists: A sudden awakening, complete confession, surrendering weapons, and bowing your heads to admit guilt are the only way out. Stubborn resistance is self-destructive for the people.

II. Fully mobilize the vast membership. The anti-Rightist struggle is a mass movement. After all, all the words and actions of the Rightists cannot escape the sharp eyes of the masses. Only when the vast majority of members actively act, launch a face-to-face struggle with the Rightists, and conduct relentless exposure and criticism, can the Rightists have no room to hide and quibble. The rectification leading bodies of organizations at all levels must regard the full mobilization of the vast membership as a key to winning a comprehensive victory. We must always pay attention to soliciting everyone's opinions, dispel ideological concerns, and absorb more people to participate in specific work, forming a strong anti-Rightist fighting force.

III. Establish a strong and powerful rectification leading body. A strong leadership core that firmly stands on the socialist position must be established to ensure the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle. The rectification leading bodies that have been established by organizations at all levels are generally good; however, some members of the rectification leading bodies have serious right-leaning thoughts and appear weak and powerless in the face of struggle. They must be criticized and adjusted in a timely manner; some are even Rightists who hold real power and hinder the development of the struggle, and they must be reorganized in whole or in part.

IV. Resolutely overcome sentimentalism and the negative emotions of evading struggle. The anti-Rightist struggle is an important key to self-reform for every member, and it is a serious political test for every member. We must actively and bravely throw ourselves into the struggle. However, there are still comrades who are staying out of the matter and are unwilling to tear their faces with the Rightists and openly break with them; some are inevitably soft-hearted when fighting because they have relatives and friends among the Rightists; some develop a "compassionate" heart when they see the Rightists putting on a distressed appearance, and they are afraid of "going too far" before they have even fought. Indulgence only breeds evil, and harboring evil will inevitably lead to future troubles. Being sentimental to the Rightists is being ruthless to the people. This is a matter of principle. Sentimentalism must be resolutely overcome. There are also comrades who, seeing that the National Revolutionary Committee has exposed many Rightists and the situation is very bad, regret joining the National Revolutionary Committee organization and do not actively fight against the Rightists; and some comrades who said some wrong things during the "blooming and contending" period are afraid of getting burned and have disappeared without a trace, daring not to stand up and fight. It must be recognized that the anti-Rightist struggle is a struggle of the whole people to distinguish right from wrong on major issues. Whether or not one is a member of a party, everyone must have a clear stand and a positive attitude in order to pass the socialist test well. As for those who have made some wrong remarks, they can only strive to correct their mistakes and improve themselves in the struggle; trying to avoid the struggle in any way is wrong.

V. Adhere to the policy of fighting by presenting the facts and reasoning things out. In the struggle, we must adhere to the method of debate, present the facts, reason things out, and allow the Rightists to debate, striving to make them convinced and bow their heads to admit their guilt. At the same time, the more accurately we strike, the more thoroughly we expose, and the more clearly we debate, the more we can educate and unite the majority and isolate and divide the Rightists. Taking simple and crude methods in the struggle without conducting in-depth and meticulous investigation and research, or without widely launching mass debates, or being in a hurry to carry out organizational handling, will neither completely defeat the Rightists nor unite and educate the majority of members. We must also strive for the Rightists to revolt and perform meritorious service, explain the policies to them, explain the advantages and disadvantages, and point out the way out.

VI. Deepen the struggle to the grassroots level. The development of our party's current anti-Rightist struggle is still very uneven. Many grassroots organizations have not yet launched the struggle, so many Rightists have not yet been exposed. Although the Rightists' positions have been shaken, they have not yet completely collapsed. In order to completely expose all Rightists and achieve a comprehensive victory, and in order to deeply educate the vast membership in the struggle, and in order to clarify the political features of organizations at all levels, while continuing to deepen the struggle in the leadership bodies of the Central Committee and provincial and municipal organizations, we must actively and systematically deepen the struggle to every grassroots organization.

Li Jishen finally said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our party participated in the democratic revolution, and in the socialist transformation and socialist construction, we have done some work that is beneficial to the country and the people. We are fully confident of achieving a complete victory in the anti-Rightist struggle. The anti-Rightist struggle is a turning point for our party to carry out fundamental transformation. Its purpose is not only to defeat the Rightists, but also the serious political task before us is to enable all members to receive a profound education through this fierce class struggle, to distinguish right from wrong, to draw clear political lines, to recognize the future, and to make up their minds according to the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, break the capitalist stance, establish the socialist stance, and lay the foundation for our party to rectify and transform the organization, so that the National Revolutionary Committee can gradually transform from a bourgeois party into a political force that truly serves socialism, in order to realize the Chinese Communist Party's wish for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

    全党动员起来，为彻底打垮右派而奋斗
    在民革全党整风工作会议上的报告摘要
    李济深
    新华社20日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会主席李济深在16日召开的民革全党整风工作会议上，作了题为“全党动员起来，为彻底打垮右派而奋斗”的报告。
    李济深在报告中首先概述了全国反右派斗争的情况。报告指出：当前在全国范围内开展着的反右派斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。这是一场关系到我们国家民族生死存亡的严重的斗争。现在这个斗争已经全面开展，逐步深入，右派分子遭到了全国人民的痛击，开始崩溃。
    李济深接着说：民革右派活动的情况是很严重的。根据现有不完全的材料统计，全党已经揭发出来的右派分子共达八百零七人。他们之中的骨干分子，过去都是惯于翻云复雨，纵横捭阖的反动派当权人物。他们运用自己反动的政治经验，进行有纲领、有计划、有组织的活动，最终目的是要颠覆人民政权，使反动统治复辟，重新奴役人民。
    李济深着重指出：民革右派活动的猖獗，右派政治影响能在不少成员中发生作用，是有它的历史根源和社会基础的。国民党反动派的社会基础是封建阶级和官僚资产阶级。民革的成员，主要是从这种反动阶级分化出来的。他们中有一部分人是带有民族资产阶级的色彩，或先或后接受了中国共产党的领导和影响，参加了民主革命；还有少数人成为革命知识分子。另有一部分人，则是由于反动统治阶级的内部矛盾，逼使他们暂时同革命势力合作。此外，还有为数不少的国民党旧军政人员，由于人民解放战争的胜利，才投向了人民，并加入了民革。上述各种人中，在民主革命战争时期和中华人民共和国成立以后，对中国共产党所提出的革命纲领一贯拥护并坚决为之奋斗的，是左派。同左派正相反的，是右派。他们不愿接受共产党的领导，不肯进行自我改造，对新的国家和社会一贯抱着敌对情绪；解放战争和土地改革这两个关，他们根本是混过来的。介乎左右两者之间的是中间派。他们对共产党提出的纲领，或则同意，或则抵触，尽管立场不免动摇，但在基本方向上还是愿意跟着时代前进的。以上就是民革成员在民主革命阶段中左、中、右的政治分野。
    到了社会主义革命阶段，由于阶级关系发生了根本变化，民革成员又表现出新的政治分野。一部分人在政治上抛弃了资本主义立场，转到工人阶级立场上来，坚决拥护社会主义和共产党的领导，成为左派。这个左派是在社会主义改造过程中逐渐形成和发展起来的，其中有一部分是从民主革命阶段的左派发展过来，有一些是从那时的中间分子转化过来的。这样的人现在还为数不多。随着反右派斗争的胜利发展，左派队伍必将逐渐地壮大起来。但在民主革命阶段的左派中，也有一些人在过社会主义这一关的时候，变为中间分子，个别的竟变成右派分子。
    占大多数的中间分子，一方面倾向于接受社会主义和共产党的领导，经过几年来社会改革的实践和学习，他们在从资本主义立场到工人阶级立场转变的长途中开始走了一步，还可以继续接受改造，向前进步。但是，在另一方面，他们基本上还没有放弃资本主义立场，对社会主义和为工农服务，总有许多不心服；对于新社会总有许多格格不入。由于中间派在政治立场上具有这样的两面性，当右派分子猖狂进攻的时候，中间分子消极的一面就不免为右派所利用，对右派寄予同情和支持。经过三个多月来对右派分子罪恶言行的揭露和批判，中间分子中越来越多的人开始清醒，他们逐渐认识到只有接受共产党的领导，走社会主义道路才是自己光明的前途，向左转化。可是，截至现在，还有一些中间分子特别是其中占比重较大的偏右的人，还未能从右派的政治影响下解脱出来，他们对反右派斗争抱有怀疑态度和抵触情绪，有的甚至还要为右派分子辩护，这不但障碍了他们自己的进步，并形成了民革反右派斗争中一个比较重大的问题。
    右派分子，坚持资本主义立场，反对社会主义，反对共产党领导，拒绝改造，有的仍然不甘心于封建阶级和官僚资产阶级的灭亡，对新社会抱着刻骨的仇恨。从历史上看，这些右派分子，或者本来就是民主革命阶段中的右派，或者是新拉进民革组织来的反动分子，也有一些是民主革命阶段中主张走中间路线而至今还不改变其原来立场的人。归根结底，一切资产阶级的右派分子实质上都是反动派，民革的右派分子多数是反共反人民的老手。
    李济深接着叙述了龙云、陈铭枢、黄绍竑、谭惕吾等右派分子的反共反苏活动情况。他指出：民革中央和各地方的右派分子，在资产阶级右派猖狂进攻中，形成了一个方面军。他们的主要特点是企图使国民党反动统治复辟。民革的右派分子，从来就企图把民革组织变成他们实现政治野心的工具。多年以来，民革内部在政治方向和组织原则上，一直进行着两条道路的斗争。这种斗争，经常反映在历次代表大会、中央全会和各种会议以及工作的具体执行上，对于某些重大问题，组织已经作出了正确的决议，右派分子却又玩弄两面手法，阳奉阴违，甚至恣意破坏，背道而驰。到了鸣放期间，民革右派分子更乘机发动了空前的猖狂进攻；这不但危害我们国家的社会主义事业，也造成了民革严重的政治危机。我们所有愿意坚决跟着共产党走社会主义光明大道的同志们，决不能听任右派分子把民革带到死路上去！
    李济深接着说：我们党当前的严重政治任务，就是彻底打垮右派，在斗争中提高全体成员的政治觉悟，进一步改造立场，为我们党进行一般性的整风作准备，并为我们党的根本改造打下基础。
    我们必须：
    一、彻底打垮右派。从中央到各个基层组织，必须把右派分子的罪恶活动在广大群众面前充分揭发，把他们的反动言论，批驳得体无完肤，彻底暴露他们的丑恶面目。三个月来，右派分子阴谋已经大大地暴露，广大成员已经开始擦亮眼睛，纷纷投入战斗，或揭发罪行，或驳斥谬论，在群众有理有力的坚决痛击之下，右派分子有的理屈词穷，不得不低头认罪；有的开始感到日暮途穷，不得不重新考虑出路；也还有一些冥顽不灵，企图继续顽抗；此外，还有不少隐藏的右派分子，群众正在积极揭发，反右派斗争正在深入扩大，必须进行到底，决不半途而废，草率收兵。在这里我们要正告右派分子：幡然悔悟、彻底坦白、缴械投降、低头认罪，才是唯一的出路，负隅顽抗，就是自绝于人民。
    二、充分发动广大成员。反右派斗争是一个群众性的运动。右派分子一切言论行动毕竟逃不过群众雪亮的眼睛。当广大成员积极行动起来，同右派分子展开面对面的斗争，进行无情的揭露和批判，才能使右派分子再无藏身和狡赖的余地。各级组织的整风领导机构，必须把充分发动广大成员看作是争取全面胜利的一个关键。要随时注意征求大家的意见，解除思想顾虑，吸收更多的人参加具体工作，组成强大的反右派的战斗队伍。
    三、建立强有力的整风领导机构。必须树立站稳社会主义立场的坚强的领导核心，才能保证反右派斗争的胜利。目前各级组织已成立的整风领导机构，一般是好的；但是有的整风领导机构的成员存在着严重右倾思想，在斗争面前显得软弱无力，必须及时加以批判和调整；有的甚至右派掌握实权，障碍斗争开展，必须进行全部或局部的改组。
    四、坚决克服温情主义和逃避斗争的消极情绪。反右派斗争是每个成员自我改造的重要关键，是对每个成员的一个严重政治考验，我们必须积极勇敢地投入斗争。但是，目前还有同志置身事外，不肯与右派分子撕破面皮，公开决裂；有的因为与右派分子有亲朋故旧的关系，在斗争的时候，就不免有些心软；有的看见右派分子装出一副窘像，便发生“慈悲”之心，还没有斗争，就害怕“过火”。姑息适足养奸，养痈必然贻患，对右派分子温情，就是对人民无情，这是一个立场问题。温情主义是必须坚决克服的。还有同志看到民革揭发出不少右派分子，情况十分恶劣，便后悔参加民革组织，而不积极向右派分子进行斗争；更有一些同志，在鸣放期间说了一些错话，怕惹火烧身，因而销声匿迹，不敢挺身战斗。必须认识，反右派斗争是全国人民一场明辨大是大非的斗争，不管是不是党派成员，每一个人都要有鲜明的立场、积极的态度，才能过好社会主义的大关。至于曾有过一些错误言论的人，更唯有争取在斗争中改正错误锻炼自己，获得提高；想用任何方式逃避斗争，都是错误的。
    五、坚持摆事实讲道理的斗争方针。在斗争中要坚持辩论的方式，摆事实，讲道理，并允许右派分子进行辩论，力求做到使他们心服口服，低头认罪。同时，愈是打得准、揭得透、辩得明，就愈能教育、团结大多数，孤立、分化右派。不作深入细致的调查研究，不广泛地开展群众性的辩论，而在斗争中采取简单粗暴的方法，或急于进行组织处理，既不能彻底打垮右派，也不能团结、教育大多数的成员。我们还要争取右派分子的起义立功，向他们讲清政策，晓以利害，指明出路。
    六、把斗争深入到基层。我们党当前反右派斗争的发展还很不平衡，不少基层组织还没有展开斗争，因而许多右派分子还没有被揭露出来，右派的阵地虽然已经动摇，但是还没有全面崩溃。为了彻底地揭发一切右派分子取得全面的胜利，为了在斗争中深刻教育广大的成员，为了澄清各级组织的政治面貌，在中央和省、市组织领导机构继续深入斗争的同时，必须积极地和有步骤地把斗争深入到每一个基层组织中去。
    李济深最后说：我们党在中国共产党的领导下，参加了民主革命，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中，做了一些有益于国家和人民的工作。我们完全有信心取得反右派斗争的彻底胜利。反右派斗争是我们党进行根本改造的转折点，其目的不仅在于打垮右派，摆在我们面前的严重政治任务，还在于通过这一场激烈的阶级斗争，使全体成员受到深刻的教育，根据毛主席所提出的六条政治标准，明辨是非，划清政治界限，认识前途，下定决心，破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场，为我们党整顿改造组织打下基础，从而使民革能够从资产阶级性质的政党逐步转变成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，以实现中国共产党提出的长期共存、互相监督的愿望。
