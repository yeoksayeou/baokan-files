Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 4th: A mother and son in Hong Kong, separated for ten years, were recently reunited with the help of the People's Government of Taishan County, Guangdong Province.

    The protagonist of this touching event, Ye Lan, is an ordinary domestic helper in Hong Kong, a poor widow. In the spring of 1947, her seven-year-old only son, Chen Jintang, was sold to Xiao Village in Taishan County, which was then under the rule of the Kuomintang, in a major child abduction case in Hong Kong. Since then, Ye Lan has lived in tears and despair for ten years.

    In the spring of 1954, she wrote a letter to the People's Government of Taishan County, recounting her tragic experience. The People's Government of Taishan County quickly sent her a reply, promising to help investigate her son and expressing sympathy and condolences for her experience. The lonely domestic helper felt immense warmth in this reply.

    Twenty days later, the People's Government of Taishan County sent Ye Lan a second letter, stating that, according to investigation, her son Chen Jintang had been sold by human traffickers to Xiao Shandong of Xiao Village, District 9, Taishan County, as his son before liberation, but they had already left their hometown for Hong Kong before liberation, residing at 22 or 23, Yen Chow Street, Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong. Ye Lan was overjoyed, but when she took this letter to inquire about her son, the Xiao family had already moved away.

    Afterwards, the People's Government of Taishan County corresponded with Ye Lan many times. On August 24th of this year, Ye Lan received another letter from the People's Government of Taishan County. It turned out that after more than three years of investigation, the People's Government of Taishan County had obtained her son's new address in Hong Kong. Ye Lan was so happy that she couldn't sleep. She quickly prepared photos of her and her son from the past, newspaper clippings and letters related to the abduction case and other evidence. On August 25th, she found her only son who had been abducted by human traffickers ten years ago. Ye Lan said with emotion: "Without the help of the People's Government, our family would never have been reunited."

    母子离别十年又团圆
    叶兰深感政府恩难忘
    据新华社香港4日电　香港一对离别了十年的母子，最近在广东省台山县人民政府的帮助下团圆了。
    这个动人的事件的主角叶兰，是香港一个普通的女佣，是个贫穷的寡妇。1947年春天，她的七岁的独生子陈锦棠在香港一件重大的拐卖儿童案中被卖到当时还在国民党统治下的台山县的箫村。从此，十年来叶兰就在眼泪和绝望中过活。
    1954年春天，她就写了封信给台山县人民政府诉说自己的悲惨遭遇。台山县人民政府很快就寄给她一封复信，答应帮助查访她的儿子，并对她的遭遇表示同情和慰问。这个孤苦的女佣在这封复信中感到了莫大的温暖。
    再过二十天，台山县人民政府给叶兰寄来了第二封信，说据调查，她的儿子陈锦棠在解放前被人口贩子卖给台山县九区萧村萧善栋为子，但他们早在解放前就已离乡去港，居住在香港深水埗钦州街二十二或二十三号。叶兰高兴非常，但是当她拿着这封信去查访她的儿子时，萧家却已搬走了。
    以后，台山县人民政府又和叶兰作了多次的书信联系。今年8月24日，叶兰又收到台山县人民政府一封信。原来经过三年多的查访，台山县人民政府得到了叶兰儿子现在香港的新的住址。叶兰喜欢得睡不着觉，连忙准备好她从前和儿子合照的照片，拐卖案发生时的剪报资料和函件等证物，在8月25日找到了她十年前被人口贩子拐走的独生子。叶兰感动地说：“如果没有人民政府的帮助，我们骨肉再也不能团聚了”。
