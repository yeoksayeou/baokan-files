　　Liaoning's Machine Industry Advances by Leaps and Bounds
　　Over 20,000 Machine Tools Produced in Four Years and Seven Months
    Shenyang, September 16th (By this newspaper) — From January 1953 to July of this year, the machine tool manufacturing industry in Liaoning Province produced a total of 22,000 various machine tools for the nation. If these machine tools were used to equip factories, they could build sixty-two heavy machinery plants each producing 10,000 tons of metallurgical equipment annually, or twenty-eight locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plants each producing one hundred locomotives and two thousand freight cars annually.
    The restoration and construction of Liaoning Province's machine industry is combined with technological transformation. Therefore, the technological level has improved remarkably in recent years. Up to now, the province has successfully trial-produced seventy-four new types of machine tools. For example, the 1A95 combined machine tool trial-produced by the Dalian Machine Tool Plant can perform various operations such as turning, boring, planing, and milling. The four-spindle gang drill successfully trial-produced by the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant can complete four processes on one machine tool.

　　辽宁机械工业大踏步前进
　　四年七个月生产母机二万多台
    本报沈阳16日电　辽宁省工作母机制造工业，从1953年1月到今年7月，共为国家生产了各种工作母机二万二千台。这些工作母机如果用来装配工厂，可建六十二个年产一万吨冶金设备的重型机器厂，或二十八个年产一百台机车和二千台货车的机车车辆制造厂。
    辽宁省机器工业的恢复和建设是和技术改造工作相结合的。因此，几年来技术水平提高极其显著。到目前为止，全省先后试制成功了七十四种新式工作母机。如大连机床厂试制出的1A95联合机床，可以进行车、搪、插、铣等多种操作。沈阳机床二厂试制成功的四轴排钻可以在一个机床上完成四道工序。
