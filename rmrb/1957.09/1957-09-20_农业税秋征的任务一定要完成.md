The Task of Autumn Agricultural Tax Collection Must Be Completed

　　The autumn harvest season has arrived, and the autumn agricultural tax collection work is about to begin. In order to achieve the grain requisition plan and ensure socialist construction, all regions should make full preparations and strengthen the autumn collection work.

　　Last year, our country won an increase in agricultural production in the struggle against severe natural disasters. The state also gave full consideration to farmers in disaster areas in terms of agricultural tax revenue, reducing the regular agricultural tax and surcharges by 5.4 billion jin. In principle, the remaining tax amount should be completed. However, last year as many as fifteen provinces and cities across the country failed to complete the task. Among them, many provinces with normal or even bumper harvests also failed to complete the task, and the amount of grain owed was greater than in previous years. Among the provinces with bumper summer harvests this year, some also failed to complete the summer tax collection task.

　　Why did this happen? The main reason is the failure to thoroughly implement the principle of "public before private" and taking into account both the interests of the state and the interests of farmers. After agricultural cooperativization, many areas believed that the task could be completed simply by notifying agricultural cooperative cadres of the amount of grain to be handed over. As a result, ideological and political work in agricultural tax collection was relaxed, so that the departmentalism of many cooperative cadres and farmers was not overcome, but instead developed. When distributing agricultural income, priority was given to distributing and distributing more rations, and less grain was handed over to the state. Some cooperatives in Zhejiang Province distributed everything after each harvest, regardless of the public grain. In Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, 160 cooperatives (accounting for 13% of the total number of cooperatives in the county) had not handed over the public grain due last year until February of this year. During this year's summer tax collection, Jiangsu Province inspected 2,414 cooperatives, and 307 cooperatives distributed all the summer harvest to the members without retaining any public grain; 531 cooperatives did not retain the public grain that should have been retained. In Teng County, Shandong Province, 30% of the cooperatives in three districts distributed the public grain to the members. In Zhibao Township, Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, nine of the fifteen agricultural cooperatives claimed that they could not complete the requisition task, with a total shortfall of more than 280,000 jin. After inspection, it was found that these nine cooperatives retained more than 330,000 jin for feed alone. Some grassroots cadres did not use socialist ideology to educate the masses and actively mobilize them to hand over grain. In this year's summer tax collection, the practice of stipulating that members' rations should be distributed first and then public grain handed over in some areas also affected state tax revenue.

　　In response to this situation, the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural cooperatives this year must be strictly implemented in accordance with the regulations. After setting aside the necessary seeds and feed for the cooperatives, public grain must first be handed over in full, then members' rations must be distributed, and then the surplus grain must be sold in accordance with the state plan. This reflects the spirit of overall consideration of the interests of the state and the interests of farmers, and all regions must resolutely implement it without any hesitation. At present, it is necessary to combine it with the socialist debate in rural areas, conduct extensive and in-depth education to the vast number of farmers, overcome departmentalism, especially overcome the right-leaning ideology and one-sided mass viewpoint among cadres, so that farmers and cadres can deeply understand the unity of national interests, collective interests, and individual interests, unify the ideas of patriotism, love of the society, and love of the family, consciously fulfill the glorious obligation of paying taxes, and actively and voluntarily hand over public grain and sell surplus grain.

　　For individual farmers, the collection should also be stepped up, and it should not be ignored because this part of the tax is small. In Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, 50% of the individual farmers in the county (6,423 households) had not handed over any of the public grain that should have been handed over last year until March of this year. This year, in the Shangyuanqiao Yangjia Cooperative Planning Zone in You County, Hunan Province, there were 31 individual farmers, of whom 29 did not pay public grain. There are also many cases of tax arrears among individual farmers in other provinces. This situation must be resolutely reversed.

　　When handing over public grain, all regions should pay attention to educating farmers to carry forward the fine tradition of handing over good grain. That is, it must be dried and cleaned to ensure quality. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the vast number of farmers in our country have always selected high-quality grain to hand over public grain in order to support the revolution and construction. However, in the past year or two, due to the relaxation of education and inspection of grain quality in various regions, a "good grain for self-retention, second-class grain for sale, and bad grain for tax payment" phenomenon has appeared in a few places. Last year, Wuming County, Guangxi Province, inspected 9.69 million jin of requisitioned grain in several districts during the summer tax collection, of which 8.23 million jin were not dry, more than 1 million jin were semi-dry, and only 460,000 jin were dry. This year, the public grain of the Xinnong Society in the western suburbs of Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, has a moisture content as high as 15%, and each kilogram of rice contains 6,500 grains of chaff. Last autumn, Dahetun, Tanghe County, Henan Province, handed over 3,000 jin of public grain and sifted out 171 jin of sand and soil. Poor quality of public grain not only affects the state's financial revenue, but also easily rots. All regions must pay attention to working hard to change this situation.

　　The reduction and exemption of agricultural tax should be based on facts. Last year's disaster reduction and exemption was generally too broad. The reduction and exemption methods stipulated by some provinces were not entirely appropriate, and the amount of tax reduction and exemption was expanded. A small number of cooperatives also falsely reported the number of reduced harvests and the number of disaster-stricken mu in order to pay less or no public grain. This year, the disaster reduction and exemption methods stipulated by all provinces must strive to be fair and reasonable, and take overall consideration into account. It is necessary to prevent both the bias of excessive reduction and exemption and the bias of not reducing or exempting when it should be reduced or exempted. It is necessary to educate farmers to report disaster situations truthfully, and the disaster situations reported below must be reviewed and verified. For cooperatives and individual farmers who have real difficulties in paying grain, part or all of the tax payable may be converted into economic crops or cash.

　　The distribution of agricultural tax regular tax and surcharges should be arranged appropriately according to the spirit of overall consideration, first the central government and then the local government, and the agricultural tax regular tax should not be allocated as local surcharges.

　　Judging from the current situation, agriculture this year is a normal year with a slight surplus, and only a few provinces have suffered relatively heavy disasters. The widespread development of the rural socialist debate and the further improvement of farmers' socialist consciousness have created favorable conditions for the autumn tax collection work. As long as the Party and government organs at all levels strengthen leadership, they will surely be able to successfully complete the task of grain requisition this year.

### 农业税秋征的任务一定要完成

　　农业税秋征的任务一定要完成
　　现在秋收季节已到，农业税秋征工作也将开始。为了实现公粮征收计划，保证社会主义建设，各地应该充分作好准备，加强秋征工作。
    去年，我们国家在与严重的自然灾害斗争中争得了农业的增产，国家在农业税收上又给了灾区农民以充分的照顾，把农业税的正税和附加，减少了五十四亿斤；按理说其余税额是应该完成的。但是，去年全国竟有十五个省、市没有完成任务。其中有不少年景正常甚至丰收的省份，也没有完成任务，而且公粮尾欠数字大于往年。今年夏季丰收的省份中，也有的没有完成夏征任务。
    为什么会发生这种情况呢？主要原因是没有很好地贯彻执行先公后私、国家利益和农民利益兼顾的原则。农业合作化以后，许多地区认为只要把应交公粮的数量通知农业社干部就能完成，因而放松了农业税征收中的思想政治工作，以致许多社干部和农民的本位主义思想没有克服，反而有了发展。在分配农业收入的时候，先分和多分口粮，少交公粮。有的社打一场分一场，不管公粮。浙江省新昌县有一百六十个合作社（占全县合作社总数的13％），去年应交的公粮，一直到今年二月间还没有交。在今年夏征的时候，江苏省检查了二千四百一十四个社，有三百零七个社夏收全部分给社员，公粮颗粒未留；有五百三十一个社应交的公粮没有如数留足。山东省滕县三个区的30％的合作社将公粮分给了社员。陕西郃阳县知堡乡的十五个农业社中，有九个社声称完不成征购任务，共差二十八万多斤。经过检查，发现这九个社光饲料一项就多留了三十三万多斤。有些基层干部没有用社会主义思想教育群众，积极动员交粮。在今年夏征中，个别地区规定先分配社员口粮然后再交公粮的办法，也影响了国家税收。
    针对这种情形，今年农业社秋收分配必须严格按照规定执行。在留出合作社必需的种籽和饲料以后，首先要如数交清公粮，再分配社员口粮，然后按照国家的计划出售余粮。这样才体现国家利益和农民利益统筹兼顾的精神，各地必须坚决执行，不能有丝毫动摇。目前应该结合农村中的社会主义大辩论，广泛深入地向广大农民进行教育，克服本位主义思想，特别要克服干部中的右倾思想和片面的群众观点，使农民群众和干部都深切了解国家利益、集体利益、个人利益的一致性，使爱国、爱社、爱家的思想统一起来，自觉地履行纳税的光荣义务，积极主动地交公粮，卖余粮。
    对于个体农户，同样应该抓紧征收，不能因为这部分税额为数不多就不加重视。浙江省江山县全县50％的个体农户（六千四百二十三户）去年应交的公粮直到今年三月仍然一点没交。今年湖南省攸县上元桥杨家社规划区内有三十一户个体农户，其中竟有二十九户不交公粮。其他省份个体农户欠税的现象也很多。这种情况必须坚决扭转。
    在交公粮的时候，各地应当注意教育农民发扬交好粮的优良传统。这就是要晒干扬净，保证质量。我国广大农民在共产党的领导下，为了支援革命和建设，一向是选用上等粮食交公粮的。但是近一、二年来，由于各地放松了这方面的教育和粮食质量的检查，少数地方出现了“好粮自留、次粮出售、坏粮交税”的现象。广西省武鸣县去年夏征时检查了几个区的征购粮九百六十九万斤，其中不干的八百二十三万斤，半干的一百多万斤，干的只有四十六万斤。今年浙江嵊县西郊乡西农会社的公粮，水份高达15％，每公斤稻谷有六千五百粒秕谷。河南省唐河县大河屯去年秋季交公粮三千斤，筛出沙土一百七十一斤。公粮质量不好，不但影响国家的财政收入，而且容易霉烂。各地必须注意努力改变这种情况。
    农业税的减免，应当实事求是。去年的灾歉减免，一般是偏宽的。有的省规定的减免办法不尽适当，扩大了减免的税额。少数合作社为了少交或不交公粮，还虚报歉收成数和受灾亩数。今年各省规定灾歉减免办法必须力求公平合理，统筹兼顾。既要防止减免过宽，也要防止应减不减或应免不免的偏向。要教育农民实报灾情，对下面所报灾情要复查核实。对于交纳粮食确有困难的合作社和个体农户，可以将应征税额的一部或全部改收经济作物或代金。
    农业税正税和附加的分配，应当根据统筹兼顾的精神适当安排，先中央、后地方，不得将农业税正税拨作地方附加。
    从目前情况看，今年农业是平年偏丰，仅有少数省份受了较重的灾害，农村社会主义大辩论的广泛展开，农民的社会主义觉悟的进一步提高，都给秋征工作创造了良好的条件。只要各级党政机关加强领导，就一定能够胜利地完成今年公粮征收的任务。
