A Peaceful Scene
—Watching the Cambodian Color Documentary “King’s Coronation”
	Xie Fengsong
	Cambodia is an ancient country with a long history and a splendid culture. As early as before the Common Era, it stood tall on the land of Asia; in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, it was one of the most prosperous and strongest countries in Southeast Asia. Today, it has freed itself from the rule of colonialists and is independent; its sons and daughters are creating a new culture and a new life.
	The color documentary "King's Coronation" mainly introduces the grand occasion of the coronation ceremony of the King of Cambodia. Such a grand ceremony has rich rituals; the rituals themselves illustrate the long history of Cambodian culture. But more importantly, through the images in the film, we see a scene of peace and tranquility in the land of Cambodia, in Phnom Penh, on the banks of the Mekong River.
	The waters of the Mekong River flow quietly and endlessly. Boats come and go, boatmen row urgently, egrets flap their wings..., everything moves in the free air.
	Through the overhead shots, we see the beautiful panorama of Phnom Penh. The city is full of lush green trees, and gilded, quaint buildings emerge from the sea of trees. These magical palaces and temples sparkle in the golden sun. The streets are lively and prosperous, and people come and go in a bustling manner.
	The architecture and furnishings in the palace are even more magnificent, resplendent and colorful. From the steps to the eaves, from the courtyard to the inner hall, everything is inlaid with gold and jade, meticulously描绘 (miao hui, painted/depicted). The king and queen's throne, couch, and all other utensils are even more precious and rare. From here, we see the wisdom and talent of the Cambodian working people; it is their skillful hands that have created this glorious and splendid art.
	The film also contains many dance scenes, recording many melodious and graceful music. These dances and music, rich in oriental sentiment and courtly color, make people feel very kind and interesting when they watch and listen to them.
	The massive military parade and procession are also very moving. Cambodia is a magnificent and magical country, which is also reflected here. Among them, there are processions dressed in Western suits and processions dressed in colorful national costumes; the troops being reviewed are also of various kinds. However, the voice we hear in these crowds is consistent, and they all seem to be shouting: We want independence! We want peace!
	We should thank the film's photographer, who shot many very beautiful shots for us. The photographer can be seen to have a very high artistic quality; his pictures, whether they are long shots, medium shots, close-ups, or extreme close-ups, are always so symmetrical, perfect, and expressive. The talented editor has made a good artistic combination of these shots, so that every scene, and even the entire film, gives people a complete and abundant feeling of beauty.

    一片和平景象
    ——看柬埔寨彩色纪录片“国王加冕”
    谢逢松
    柬埔寨是一个有着悠久历史和灿烂文化的古国。远在纪元前，她就屹立在亚洲的大地上；十一、十二世纪时，她曾是东南亚最繁荣、最富强的一个国家。今天，她摆脱了殖民主义者的统治，独立了；她的儿女，正在创建着新的文化、新的生活。
    彩色纪录影片“国王加冕”，主要是介绍柬埔寨国王加冕大典的盛况。这样的隆重大典，有丰富的仪式；仪式本身，正说明了柬埔寨文化的源远流长。但是，更为重要的，我们通过影片的画面，看到在柬埔寨的国土上，在金边，在湄公河畔，是一片安乐的景象，和平的景象。
    湄公河的流水，静静地、无休止地在流着。船只在来来往往，船夫在急急拨桨，鹭鸶在拍打翅膀……，一切都活动在自由的空气里。
    通过俯摄的镜头，我们看见美丽的金边城的全貌。满城是葱绿苍翠的树木，树海里浮现出金碧辉煌、古色古香的建筑物。这些神奇的宫苑庙宇，在金阳下闪闪发光。街道上热闹而且繁华，人们熙来攘往。
    皇宫里的建筑和陈设，更是富丽堂皇，五光十色。从台阶到屋檐，从庭院到内厅，处处都是金镶玉砌、精描巧绘的。国王和皇后的宝座、卧榻和其他一切用具，更是珍奇。我们从这里看到柬埔寨劳动人民的智慧和才华，是他们灵巧的双手创造了这光辉灿烂的艺术。
    影片里还摄有不少的舞蹈场面，记录下了很多悠扬婉转的音乐。这些富有东方情调和宫廷色彩的舞蹈和音乐，使人看起来、听起来，很亲切，很有趣味。
    声势浩大的阅兵式和游行队伍，也很动人。柬埔寨是一个富丽而神奇的国家，在这里也得到反映。其中有全身穿着西服的游行队伍，也有全身穿着绚丽多彩的民族服装的游行队伍；受检阅的军队，也是各色各样的。但是，我们在这些人群中所听到的声音却是一致的，他们似乎都在呼喊：我们要独立！我们要和平！
    我们应该感谢影片的摄影师，他给我们拍摄了很多十分优美的镜头。摄影师看得出来是有很高的艺术素养的，他的画面，不管是远景、中景、近景，或者是特写，都总是那样匀称、完美而富有表现力。有才华的编辑，把这些镜头作了很好的艺术的组合，使得每一个场面，以至于整部影片，都给人一种完满而丰足的美的感受。
