Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 13th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Meng Fan reports: The Second Session of the Second Tianjin Municipal People's Congress, which opened on the 4th, concluded today after achieving a brilliant victory in the anti-Rightist struggle. At this meeting, over 700 people's representatives and attendees engaged in a nine-day debate with bourgeois rightists. The reactionary statements of rightists Bi Mingqi, Wang Huatang, Zhang Jizheng, Lei Haizong, Xu Zhongjie, Fu Zhufu, Nie Guoping, Yang Sishen, Lei Aide, He Chi, Rong Zizheng, Dong Shaochen, Wang Luhe, Zhao Guangting, Wang Dachuan, Guan Songjian, and Li Limin were refuted so thoroughly that the vast majority of them finally bowed their heads and confessed their guilt to the people.

When the representatives heard the news of the upcoming People's Congress, they actively gathered materials to prepare for the anti-Rightist struggle. Some representatives went out to investigate and visit during the day and organized materials until late at night; some representatives gathered to jointly study the rightists' materials, preparing for systematic criticism; some representatives went deep into the electoral districts to solicit voters' opinions on the anti-Rightist struggle. From the very beginning of the meeting, the people's representatives and attendees carried a large number of materials and, with full confidence, used the method of presenting facts and reasoning to engage in debate with the rightists. Under the full exposure and thorough rebuttal of the representatives, even the most stubborn rightists could not deny their guilt and had to further confess their crimes.

Rightist Zhang Jizheng said that he only made some remarks similar to those of rightists and that it was not a question of being anti-Communist and anti-socialist. The representatives pointed out: Zhang Jizheng smeared the Communist Party as "not engaging in production and only exploiting the people," and he wanted party cadres to "step down" and do "making beds" and "sweeping the floor" work. Isn't this obviously an attack on the Communist Party? Zhang Jizheng once clamored that "the trade union should play the role of an opposition party" and also advocated that "the leadership of the hospital should be based on a vanguard team based on the medical alliance." Isn't this an attempt to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party? Only then was Zhang Jizheng speechless and unable to say anything, and he began to confess his guilt and admit defeat.

In the third representative group of the meeting, the representatives refuted the fallacies spread by the rightist Rong Zizheng, such as "the bourgeoisie started out by being diligent" and "when enterprises were jointly operated, property was cleared and assessed, everything was underestimated, resulting in a reduction in the capital contributions of the capitalists," with concrete facts. Representative Che Chongyuan revealed the fact that Rong Zizheng cruelly exploited workers, and attendee Guo Zechang pointed out: At the time of the joint operation of the entire industry, the method of capitalists self-counting, self-estimating, self-filling, and self-reporting was adopted for clearing and verifying assets. Some capitalists once had a phenomenon of underestimating assets, which has been corrected after government inspection. For example, after inspection of more than 600 enterprises in 14 industries such as printing in the city, the estimated value was increased by more than 600,000 yuan. At that time, in order to transform more than 1,000 enterprises with debts exceeding assets, the government also reduced or exempted more than 8 million yuan of debts owed to the state by capitalists, and employees also automatically reduced their wages by more than 500,000 yuan. These facts all show that Rong Zizheng is fabricating facts out of thin air and deliberately inciting industrialists and businessmen to attack the Communist Party and the government. Under the representatives' reasoned rebuttals, Rong Zizheng had to admit that he was "deliberately negating the achievements of socialist transformation" and "had the idea of long live capitalism, wanting fame on the one hand and being reluctant to part with money on the other."

In this great debate, the change was extremely obvious among some intellectuals who originally did not speak much and had a tendency towards sentimentality towards the rightists. After recognizing the major issues of right and wrong, they also scrambled to stand up and debate with the rightists. When launching a struggle against the rightist Lei Haizong, some people initially believed that Lei Haizong's was merely a "matter of academic thought" and "different from other rightists." Only when many people revealed that Lei Haizong not only vilified Marxism-Leninism during the blooming and contending period but also relied on Chiang Kai-shek to openly engage in anti-Communist and anti-people criminal activities more than a decade ago did they realize that they had been deceived. Through this struggle, many representatives deeply realized the importance of strengthening ideological transformation and overcoming individual thoughts of fame and gain.

### 天津人代会上大辩论的大收获　绝大多数右派分子认罪服输　一些有温情主义的知识分子也参加了同右派的斗争

　　天津人代会上大辩论的大收获
　　绝大多数右派分子认罪服输
　　一些有温情主义的知识分子也参加了同右派的斗争
    据新华社天津13日电  新华社记者孟帆报道：4日开幕的天津市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议在取得反右派斗争的辉煌胜利后，已经在今天闭幕。在这次会议上，七百多名人民代表和列席人员同资产阶级右派分子进行了九天的大辩论，右派分子毕鸣岐、王华棠、张纪正、雷海宗、许忠杰、傅筑夫、聂国屏、杨思慎、雷爱德、何迟、荣子正、董少臣、王履和、赵光庭、王大川、关颂坚、李立民的反动言论被反驳得体无完肤，最后他们中的绝大多数已经低头向人民认罪。
    当代表们听到要开人民代表大会的消息，就积极地搜集材料进行反右派的准备。有些代表白天出外调查访问，晚间整理材料直到深夜；有些代表还聚在一起共同研究了右派分子的材料，准备进行系统的批判；有的代表深入选区征求选民对反右派斗争的意见。会议一开始，人民代表和列席人员就携带着大批材料，信心百倍地以摆事实、讲道理的方法同右派分子展开了论战。在代表们的充分揭露和彻底批驳下，一批最顽强的右派分子也无法狡赖，不得不进一步交代他们的罪行。
    右派分子张纪正说自己仅仅是发表了一些类似右派分子的言论，不是什么反共反社会主义的问题。代表们指出：张纪正污蔑共产党
  “不事生产、光剥削人民”，他要党员干部“下台”，去干“铺床”、“扫地”的工作，难道不是明显地向共产党进攻吗？张纪正曾叫嚣“工会要起反对党的作用”，还主张由“以医护联盟为基础的先锋队来领导医院工作”，这不是企图取消共产党的领导吗？张纪正这才张口结舌，无话可说，开始认罪服输。
    在会议的第三代表组，代表们以具体事实驳斥了右派分子荣子正散布的“资产阶级是勤劳起家”、
  “在企业合营时清估财产，样样估得不值钱，结果减少了资方的股金”等谬论。车重远代表揭露了荣子正残酷剥削工人的事实，列席人员郭泽长指出：全行业合营时清产核资是采取资本家自点、自估、自填、自报的办法，有些资本家一度发生估产偏低现象，经政府检查后已经纠正。如全市印刷等十四个行业的六百多个企业，经检查后估值就调高了六十多万元。当时政府为了使一千多户业不抵债的企业得到改造，还减免了资本家积欠国家的债务八百多万元，职工也自动减免了工资五十多万元。这些事实都说明荣子正是无中生有，有意煽动工商业者向共产党和政府进攻。在代表们的据理驳斥下，荣子正不得不承认他是“故意否定社会主义改造的成绩”，“有资本主义万岁的思想，一方面想要名，一方面又舍不得钱。”
    在这场大辩论中，转变极为明显的是一些原来不大发言、对右派分子有温情主义的知识分子，他们在认清了大是大非以后，也都争先恐后地起来和右派分子展开辩论。在对右派分子雷海宗展开斗争的时候，有的人开始时认为雷海宗只是
  “学术思想问题”，“和别的右派分子不同”。当许多人揭露了雷海宗不仅在鸣放时诋毁马列主义，而且早在十多年前就依靠蒋介石公开从事反共、反人民的罪恶活动，才认识到是被蒙蔽了。许多代表经过这场斗争，深刻地体会到加强思想改造，克服个人名利思想的重要性。
