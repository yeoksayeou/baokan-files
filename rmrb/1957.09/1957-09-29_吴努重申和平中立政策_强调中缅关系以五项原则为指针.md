Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 28th: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu said on the 27th that the aim of Burma's policy of peace and neutrality is to seek world peace and to establish and maintain friendly relations with all countries.

U Nu delivered a five-hour policy speech to the House of Representatives. His speech was divided into five main sections: law and order, national unity, social welfare, national economy, and foreign affairs.

Regarding Burma's relations with China, U Nu said that since Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma in 1954, "both of our countries have been guided by the Five Principles."

He said that the Sino-Burmese border issue "is not of recent origin." It is a problem that we inherited from the British upon gaining independence because the British and the then Chinese government failed to resolve it. He said that the two governments are now actively working to find a solution to this problem. The general principles for resolving this issue were reached during his visit to China last November.

U Nu said that the Burmese government is now studying the Chinese government's recent reply to the Burmese government's proposal for resolving the border issue.

U Nu also said that Burma has always expressed its gratitude for the People's Republic of China's helpful and understanding attitude towards the problem caused by the invasion of the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the Burmese-Chinese border.

Referring to Burmese-Soviet relations, U Nu said he believes that Burma enjoys the full trust and support of the Soviet Union. In the difficult days of 1954 and 1955, when Burma was unable to find buyers for its rice, the Soviet Union helped Burma by engaging in barter trade, which exchanged large quantities of Burma's surplus rice.

    吴努重申和平中立政策
    强调中缅关系以五项原则为指针
    据新华社仰光28日电　缅甸总理吴努27日说：缅甸和平中立外交政策的目的是谋求世界和平，建立和保持同各国的友好关系。
    吴努在国会代表院发表了长达五小时的政策演说。他的演说分成法律和秩序、民族团结、社会福利、国民经济和外交事务等五个主要部分。
    吴努在谈到缅甸同中国的关系时说，自从1954年周恩来总理访问印度和缅甸以来，“我们两国都是以五项原则为指针的”。
    他说，中缅边界问题“并不是最近才产生的”。它是因为英国人和当时的中国政府未能解决因而我们在取得独立的时候从英国人那里继承下来的一个问题。他说，两国政府现在正在积极努力谋求这个问题的解决。在他去年11月访问中国时，解决这个问题的一般原则已经达成。
    吴努说，缅甸政府现在正在研究中国政府最近对于缅甸政府提出的解决边界问题的建议的答复。
    吴努还说，缅甸对于中华人民共和国对蒋介石残余部队在缅中边境上的侵略所造成的问题采取的帮助和谅解的态度，总是表示感谢的。
    谈到缅苏关系时，吴努说，他相信缅甸是受到苏联充分的信赖和支持的。在1954年和1955年的艰苦的日子里，当时缅甸的大米找不到买主，苏联便同缅甸进行易货贸易来帮助缅甸，这次贸易换掉了大量的缅甸剩余大米。
