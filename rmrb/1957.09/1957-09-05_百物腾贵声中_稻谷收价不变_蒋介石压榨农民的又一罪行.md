    Amidst Rising Prices, Rice Purchase Price Remains Unchanged
    Another Crime of Chiang Kai-shek's Exploitation of Farmers
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Amidst the rising prices in Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique continues to adopt a policy of suppressing the purchase price of rice produced by Taiwanese farmers. Taiwanese newspapers report that this year's rice purchase price in Taiwan remains unchanged from a year ago, still at NT$1.63 per kilogram. This decision by the Taiwan authorities has already aroused dissatisfaction from all sectors in Taiwan.
    The price increase of many commodities in Taiwan is in stark contrast to the "fixed" rice purchase price. Diesel and fuel oil have increased by 50% and 33% respectively. Prices of beans, building materials, sugar, rice, etc. have also increased.

    百物腾贵声中　稻谷收价不变
    蒋介石压榨农民的又一罪行
    据新华社讯　蒋介石集团在台湾百物腾贵声中，对台湾农民生产的稻谷继续采取压价收购政策。台湾报纸报道，今年台湾的稻谷收购价格，维持一年前的价格不变，每公斤仍为台币一元六角三分。台湾当局的这项决定，已经激起台湾各方的不满。
    台湾许多商品价格上涨，同稻谷收购价格“钉死”适成对照。柴油和燃料油分别涨价50％和33％。豆类、建筑材料、砂糖、大米等也涨了价。
