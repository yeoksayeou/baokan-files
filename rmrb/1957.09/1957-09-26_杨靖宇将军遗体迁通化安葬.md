Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 25th: The remains of the anti-Japanese national hero, General Yang Jingyu, were moved from the Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall in Harbin to Tonghua City, Jilin Province today for burial.

At 8:00 a.m. today, more than 700 people from all walks of life in Harbin attended the ceremony at the Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall to respectfully escort General Yang Jingyu's remains. Amidst the sound of mourning music, Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, along with General Yang Jingyu's former comrades-in-arms Li Yanlu, Wang Minggui, Yu Tianfang, Chen Lei, and Zhang Ruilin, acted as pallbearers, respectfully escorting General Yang Jingyu's coffin to Harbin Railway Station, where it was transported by train to Tonghua City.

General Yang Jingyu, whose original name was Ma Shangde, was a member of the Chinese Communist Party. During the Japanese imperialist occupation of Northeast China, he carried out the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party, leading the First Route Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army to persist in the struggle under extremely difficult circumstances, inflicting significant blows on the Japanese invaders. In 1940, he was surrounded by an overwhelming enemy force and died heroically in Mengjiang County, Jilin Province. The Japanese fascists cruelly dissected General Yang Jingyu's body and discovered that his stomach contained only grass, tree roots, and cotton. To commemorate this immortal general's loyalty to the motherland, Mengjiang County has been renamed Jingyu County.

    杨靖宇将军遗体迁通化安葬
    新华社哈尔滨25日电　抗日民族英雄杨靖宇将军的遗体今天由哈尔滨东北烈士纪念馆迁往吉林省通化市安葬。
    今天上午八时，哈尔滨各界人士七百多人到东北烈士纪念馆出席了恭送杨靖宇将军遗体的大会。在哀乐声中，由中共黑龙江省委书记强晓初，杨靖宇将军的生前战友李延禄、王明贵、于天放、陈雷和张瑞麟等人执绋，将杨靖宇将军的灵椁恭送到哈尔滨车站，由火车启运通化市。
    杨靖宇将军本名马尚德，是中国共产党党员。日本帝国主义侵占东北时期，他执行中国共产党的指示，领导抗日联军第一路军在极端困难的情况下坚持斗争，给日本侵略者以很大的打击。1940年，他被绝对优势的敌人包围，在吉林省蒙江县英勇殉国，日本法西斯曾残酷地将杨靖宇将军的遗体解剖，发现将军的肠胃内只有草皮、树根和棉花。为纪念这位永垂不朽的将军对祖国的忠贞，将蒙江县已改名为靖宇县。
