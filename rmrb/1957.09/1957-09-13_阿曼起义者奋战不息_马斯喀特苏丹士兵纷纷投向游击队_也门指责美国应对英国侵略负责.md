Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, September 11th: Although the British military authorities have established strict press censorship in Muscat and Oman, and although the British government has issued communiqués stating that the Omani war is over, news from Aden indicates that most of the Omani insurgent tribes are hidden in the mountains and continue to wage a tenacious guerrilla war, attacking vehicles loaded with food and weapons, and destroying warehouses storing fuel and ammunition. This situation has forced the British authorities to increase the number of troops protecting the Muscat-Oman transport line.

From August 28th to September 1st, forty-six Omani patriots in Nizwa were executed for maintaining contact with the guerrillas and supplying them with food. The Sultan of Muscat has been forced to adopt such cruel measures because of the increasing number of his soldiers defecting to the guerrillas. Desertion from the Sultan's army has become widespread. In order to prevent the disintegration of the Muscat Sultan's army, the British have even deployed their own blocking forces behind the Sultan's troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 11th: The Yemeni Minister to Egypt lodged a protest with the American Embassy on the 10th, accusing the United States of taking a passive attitude towards the British aggression against Yemen.

The Yemeni protest stated that the United States and other Western countries are also responsible for the British aggression against Yemen.

The Yemeni Minister also notified the heads of missions of Arab countries in Cairo that Britain is continuing its aggression against Yemen.

　　阿曼起义者奋战不息
　　马斯喀特苏丹士兵纷纷投向游击队
　　也门指责美国应对英国侵略负责
    据新华社12日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特11日讯：尽管英国军事当局在马斯喀特和阿曼建立了严格的新闻检查，尽管英国政府发布了阿曼战事已经结束的公报，但是，来自亚丁的消息指出，阿曼起义部落的大部分队伍都隐藏在山区里，继续进行顽强的游击战争，袭击装载粮食和武器的车辆，破坏保存燃料和弹药的仓库。这种情况使得英国当局不得不增加保护马斯喀特—阿曼交通线的军队人数。
    从8月28日到9月1日，尼兹瓦市有四十六名阿曼爱国者以同游击队员保持联系和接济他们粮食的罪名被处死刑。马斯喀特苏丹所以要采取残酷的措施，是因为他的士兵投向游击队的情况越来越多。苏丹军队中开小差的现象已经具有普遍性。为了防止马斯喀特苏丹军队的瓦解，英国人还把自己的牵制部队配置在苏丹军队后面。
    新华社开罗11日电　也门驻埃及公使10日向美国大使馆提出抗议，指责美国对英国侵略也门的行动采取消极态度。
    也门的抗议说，美国和其他西方国家对英国侵略也门的行动也负有责任。
    也门公使还通知阿拉伯国家驻开罗的使节说，英国正在继续侵略也门。
