    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 26th: A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on September 25th, condemning Turkish Prime Minister Menderes for interfering in Syria's internal affairs.

    The statement said, "The statement made by Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, broadcast yesterday by Ankara Radio, expressing concern and unease about the situation in Syria, shows that Turkey has begun to openly participate in the movement launched by imperialist countries against Syria."

    The statement pointed out that Menderes' claims that the situation in Syria "threatens" peace and security, that Syria is a "huge danger" to the Middle East, and that Syria is importing weapons "beyond its needs," etc., are all absurd. The statement said, "Especially when Turkey has become a base and arsenal used by the United States to threaten the security of the Middle East and serve the interests and strategic plans of the United States due to American policy, it is indeed utterly absurd to still insist on saying this."

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 26th: "Neues Deutschland" today published the Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Bizri's answers to questions from the newspaper's Middle East correspondent.

    Referring to the U.S. Embassy's conspiracy to create a rebellion in Syria, Bizri said: "This kind of conspiracy is not the first time, and it will not be the last."

    Bizri said: The Syrian army is the people's army, and the people love their army. The unity of the Syrian people and the army makes the imperialists panic.

    Bizri said: There is a great contradiction between Washington's actions and words. Washington says it is "fighting for freedom," but it sends Henderson to Constantinople to create conspiracies and instigate the gathering of troops around Syria. Bizri said: In fact, the "freedom" that the United States defends is the freedom of imperialism. Bizri finally said: "If the aggressor dares to invade our borders, let them recognize our people who are truly fighting for freedom!"

    叙外交部斥土总理干涉内政
    比兹里说叙利亚军民一致团结御侮
    据新华社大马士革26日电　叙利亚外交部发言人9月25日发表声明，谴责土耳其总理曼德列斯干涉叙利亚的内政。
    声明说，“安卡拉电台昨天广播的土耳其总理曼德列斯对叙利亚局势表示担忧和不安的声明，表明土耳其已经开始公开参加帝国主义国家发动的反对叙利亚的运动。”
    声明指出，曼德列斯所谓叙利亚局势“威胁”和平和安全，所谓叙利亚是对中东的“巨大危险”，所谓叙利亚输入的武器“超过它的需要”等等，都是荒谬的。声明说，
  “特别是在土耳其已由于美国的政策，而变成被美国用来威胁中东安全并为美国的利益和战略计划服务的基地和兵工厂的时候，它还硬要这样说，那就确实是荒谬绝伦了。”
    据新华社柏林26日电　“新德意志报”今天刊登了叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里答该报驻中近东记者的问题。
    在谈到美国大使馆制造叙利亚叛变的阴谋时，比兹里说：“这种阴谋已经不是第一次了，而且这也不是最后一次。
    比兹里说：叙利亚军队是人民的军队，人民热爱他的军队。叙利亚人民和军队的一致使帝国主义惊惶失措。
    比兹里说：华盛顿的行动和言语之间存在着很大的矛盾。华盛顿说：它是在“为自由而斗争”，但是却派汉德逊去君士坦丁堡制造阴谋事变，策动在叙利亚周围集结军队。比兹里说：事实上美国保卫的“自由”是帝国主义的自由。比兹里最后说：“假如侵略者胆敢侵犯我们的边境，就让它认识一下真正为自由而斗争的我国人民！”
