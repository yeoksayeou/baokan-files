　　Flood Subdued Under the Feet of Heroic People
　　Military and Civilians of Harbin Fight Hard for Twenty-Four Days and Nights
　　Blocked the Ferocious Flood Four Meters Higher Than the Urban Area
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Tao Suqi and Han Zhifei reported: This year's extraordinary flood on the Songhua River, after twenty-four days and nights of hard struggle by the people of Harbin and the People's Liberation Army participating in flood control, was finally subdued under the feet of the heroic people.
This year's flood on the Songhua River was ferocious, with the highest water level reaching 120.30 meters, 58 centimeters higher than the highest water level during the 1932 Harbin flood disaster under the Japanese and puppet regime, and 24 centimeters higher than the highest water level in 1956, which was a once-in-a-century event. During the flood control struggle, the city mobilized flood control materials worth more than 7 million yuan and tens of thousands of vehicles and ships to participate in flood control; three railway special lines were temporarily laid for soil transportation needs. Every day, more than 100,000 people worked hard on the 129-kilometer-long dike, raising and widening the dike body, and finally blocked the Songhua River flood, which was three to four meters higher than the urban area, outside the dam.
It would have been impossible to complete such a vast project and arduous organizational work without the leadership of the Communist Party. Since the beginning of summer, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized more than 880,000 person-times of voluntary labor to universally strengthen the city's dikes. When the extraordinary flood peak formed in the upper reaches of the Songhua River, the city drew more than 800 crack cadres to form flood control headquarters at all levels, and flood control agencies were also established in various units in the city. At the call, a mighty flood control army immediately and orderly entered the flood control position. When the water situation was critical, the People's Liberation Army stationed in other places immediately came to support, and the factory workers, except for a part of them who stayed to persist in production, immediately went to the flood control front to reinforce. Hundreds of Party and League branches in the 300,000 flood control army played a fortress role, and four outstanding children of the motherland, including Communist Youth League member Yang Fu, dedicated their precious lives.
In the flood control struggle, the citizens of Harbin showed unlimited trust and support for the Communist Party. When the water situation was critical, no residents in the urban area panicked and moved automatically. During the flood control period, 10,000 flood control models and more than 100 flood control model units emerged in the city.
During the period of flood threat, Harbin constantly received the care of the central government and the support of the people of various provinces and cities and regions. These have greatly enhanced the fighting spirit of the people of Harbin.

　　洪水驯服在英雄人民脚下
　　哈尔滨市军民艰苦搏斗二十四昼夜
　　挡住了高出市区四公尺的凶猛洪水
    据新华社哈尔滨18日电　新华社记者陶肃琦、韩之非报道：今年松花江上的特大洪水，经过哈尔滨市人民和参加防汛的人民解放军二十四昼夜的艰苦搏斗，终于驯服在英雄人民的脚下。
    今年松花江上的洪水来势凶猛，最高水位达到一二○·三○公尺，比日伪统治时期1932年哈尔滨大水灾时的最高水位高五十八公分，比1956年百年一遇的最高水位也高二十四公分。在防汛斗争的日子里，全市动员了价值七百多万元的防汛器材和数以万计的车辆、船只参加防洪；为了运土需要，还临时敷设了三条铁路专用线。每天有十几万人到一百二十九公里的长堤上紧张劳动，加高、加宽了堤身，终于把高于市区三公尺到四公尺的松花江洪水阻挡在堤坝之外。
    完成这样浩大的工程和艰巨的组织工作，没有共产党的领导是不可能的。中共哈尔滨市委员会自入夏以来，就组织了八十八万多人次的义务劳动，普遍加固了全市堤坝。当特大洪峰在松花江上游形成的时候，全市抽调了八百多个精悍的干部组成了各级防汛指挥部，市内各单位也建立了防汛机构。一声号召，声势浩大的防汛大军立刻有秩序地进入防汛阵地。当水情紧急的时候，驻在外地的人民解放军立即前来支援，工厂工人除留一部分人坚持生产以外，也立即开到防洪前线增援。三十多万防汛大军中的几百个党团支部，发扬了堡垒作用，共青团员杨富等四个祖国优秀的儿女，并且献出了他们的宝贵的生命。
    哈尔滨市民在防汛斗争中对共产党表现了无限的信任和支持。在水情紧急的时候，市区居民没有一家惊惶失措自动迁移。防汛期间，全市涌现了一万个防汛模范和百余防汛模范单位。
    哈尔滨在洪水威胁期间，不断地得到中央的关怀和各省市、各地人民的支援。这些都大大增强了哈尔滨人民的斗志。
