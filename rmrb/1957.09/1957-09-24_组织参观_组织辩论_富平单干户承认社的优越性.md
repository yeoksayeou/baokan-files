Fuping Individual Farmers Acknowledge the Superiority of the Cooperatives

(Our report) According to news from the Shaanxi Daily: The Agriculture Department of the Fuping County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has adopted methods of organizing visits, forums, and debates for individual farmers to educate and influence them to join cooperatives, achieving very good results. After the collectivization in Fuping County, there were still more than 910 individual farming households outside the cooperatives, most of whom were relatively wealthy farmers. After the establishment of the cooperatives, due to the district and township cadres being busy with the work of the agricultural cooperatives, they neglected the education of farmers outside the cooperatives. Many individual farmers relaxed agricultural production and engaged in speculation and business, keeping more grain and cotton, deliberately delaying the payment of public grain, not selling surplus grain, and evading state compulsory labor. Some even spoke nonsense, saying: "Individual farmers also have several advantages." "Collectivization has been messed up." A few cooperative members were confused by this phenomenon and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative and farm individually.

In response to this situation, the Agriculture Department of the Fuping County Party Committee, from August 30 to September 2, organized 137 representatives of individual farming households and 178 cooperative cadres and members who still did not believe in cooperatives, for three days. They visited and studied the production and living conditions of members of the six agricultural cooperatives in Daoxian, Liuqu, Zhonghui, Beigeng, Zhuangzhen, and Xiren, and exchanged experience in running cooperatives. Forums were also held at the meeting, debating the question of "whether individual farming is better or cooperation is better."

At the meeting, Liu Zuowei, the branch secretary of the Zhonghui Agricultural Cooperative, used the changes in the production and lives of the cooperative members of his cooperative to illustrate the great power of cooperation. He said that before liberation, the farmers of Zhonghui Village were exploited by the landlord Liu Guanshi. The landlord occupied more than 350 mu of land out of the village's 900 mu, and there were 10 households working as long-term laborers for the landlord, and 14 households who were chronically short of food and owed debts. Poor cooperative member Sun Chunxue lived a life where he dared not go out on the first day of the Lunar New Year; Liu Wenxiang went out to beg. He said that some people were secretly shedding tears. In 1952, this village established mutual aid teams, and the average yield of wheat per mu reached 293 jin, which was more than 12% higher than that of local individual farmers; in 1954, a primary cooperative was established, and the yield increased to 340 jin, which was 30% higher than that of the mutual aid team; in 1956, it was transformed into an advanced cooperative, and the yield reached 397 jin, which was 16.7% higher than that of the primary cooperative; this year's wheat yield was 51 jin higher per mu than that of the wealthy individual farmer Zhang Youcai in the local area. Now, none of the 247 cooperative member households in the entire cooperative is a food-deficient household, and more than half of the households have cash deposits in the credit cooperative. His speech made some people listen intently, and some people smiled.

Visits were also conducted during the meeting, giving the attendees a profound factual education. The most prominent thing was the well-irrigated corn of the Zhonghui Cooperative and the Liuqu Cooperative, which was particularly eye-catching. Although the weather was so dry, it still grew so strong. According to visual estimation, the average yield per mu was more than 240 jin. The spirit of the Zhonghui Cooperative members in preventing drought and fighting drought and rescuing autumn crops was admirable. More than 90 waterwheels in the entire cooperative worked day and night, watering more than 800 mu of corn and also watering a lot of cotton. They are also repairing old wells and digging new wells, preparing to install another 60 waterwheels. The cooperative members said: "Collectivization has great power, and we are not afraid of drought."

After debates and visits, many people were convinced and admitted that cooperation is good. Among the 137 individual farmers, 124 immediately expressed their willingness to join the cooperative. More than 100 cooperative cadres and members who attended the meeting also said that they would no longer demand to withdraw from the cooperative. (Picture attached)

    组织参观　组织辩论
    富平单干户承认社的优越性
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：中共富平县委农业部采取组织单干户参观、座谈、辩论的办法教育和影响单干户入社收到了很好的效果。富平县合作化后，社外还有九百一十多户单干农民，这些单干户多半是较富裕的农民。建社后，由于区、乡干部忙于农业社的工作，忽视了对社外农民的教育，不少单干户放松了农业生产大搞投机生意，多留粮棉，有意的拖欠公粮不交，余粮不卖，逃避国家义务劳动等。有的还胡言乱语的说：“单干户也有几大优越性。”“合作化搞糟了。”少数社员被这种现象所迷惑，想退社单干。
    中共富平县委农业部，针对这种情况，在8月30日至9月2日，以三天时间，组织了一百三十七名单干户代表，一百七十八名对社还不相信的社干部和社员，参观访问了到贤、流曲、忠惠、北耕、庄镇和西仁六个农业社的生产和社员生活情况，交流了办社经验，会上还进行了座谈，辩论了“究竟是单干户好，还是合作化好”的问题。
    在会上，忠惠农业社分支部书记刘作为用本社社员的生产生活的转变情况来说明合作化的力量大。他说，忠惠村农民解放前受地主刘官世的剥削，全村九百多亩地，地主就占了三百五十多亩，给地主拉长工的就有十户，常年没啥吃欠人债的十四户。贫农社员孙春雪过着大年初一不敢出门的日子；刘文香出外乞讨。他说到这里，有些人在暗暗落泪。1952年，这个村办起互助组，小麦平均亩产就达二百九十三斤，比当地单干农民高出12％多；1954年，办起初级社，产量提高到三百四十斤，比互助组高出30％；1956年转了高级社，产量达三百九十七斤，比初级社时又高出16.7％；今年小麦比当地单干的富裕农民张有才每亩高出五十一斤。现在，全社二百四十七户社员，没有一户是缺粮户，一半以上的户在信用社存有现款。他的发言使有些人听的入神，有些人眉开眼笑。
    会议中还进行了参观访问，使到会人受到了一次深刻的事实教育。最突出的是忠惠社和流曲社的井灌玉米格外引人注目，天气那样干旱，长的仍是那样健壮，据目测平均亩产都在二百四十斤以上。忠惠社社员防旱抗旱、抢救秋禾的精神令人羡慕，全社九十多辆水车日夜不停，浇了八百多亩玉米，又浇了许多棉花，他们还在修旧井、打新井，准备再安装六十多辆水车，社员说：“合作化、力量大，天再干旱也不怕。”
    经过了辩论、参观，许多人都心服口服了，承认合作化就是好。在一百三十七户单干农民中，就有一百二十四户当场表示要马上入社。到会的一百多名社干部和社员，也表示不再闹退社了。（附图片）
