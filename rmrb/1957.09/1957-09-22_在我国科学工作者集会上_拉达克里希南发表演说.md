At a gathering of over five hundred Chinese scientists this morning, the Vice President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan, stated in a speech: "All differences existing between the two major camps in the world can be resolved through the spirit of peaceful coexistence, without resorting to force or atomic warfare."

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, presided over today's lecture. Renowned Chinese philosophers, historians, oriental linguists, and other scientists attended the lecture. Prior to the lecture, Radhakrishnan, accompanied by Guo Moruo and others, visited the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In his speech, lasting over half an hour, Dr. Radhakrishnan focused on philosophically expounding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the ideological foundation of world peace. He also outlined the historical development of Eastern and Western cultures, including those of India, China, Greece, and Rome, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening cultural exchange among nations. He stated, "The cultural cooperation between India and China in the past has contributed to the development of Asian culture. We have done so in the past, and we should continue to do so in the future."

Dr. Radhakrishnan pointed out that "the friendship between India and China is firmly established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the code of conduct for international relations." He added, "If we continue to faithfully and steadfastly implement these principles, our countries will have a brighter future."

He concluded by congratulating Chinese science for its further achievements in building a great civilization of the future on behalf of Indian scientists.

Dr. Radhakrishnan's speech was frequently interrupted by prolonged and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

President Guo Moruo delivered speeches before and after the lecture by the Vice President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan, expressing heartfelt welcome and gratitude for Radhakrishnan's attendance. Guo Moruo said that social scientists, natural scientists, and technical scientists from China and India should join hands, exchange experiences, learn from each other, and contribute to the construction of their respective countries, to Asian and world peace, and to the progress and happiness of mankind. He also expressed his hope that the fraternal friendship between China and India would continue to expand.

Guo Moruo said, "May the power of human culture and the power of peace forever, comprehensively, and thoroughly eliminate human disasters and wars."

Finally, President Guo Moruo and all attendees unanimously shouted "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" in Hindi, filling the hall with a warm atmosphere of Sino-Indian friendship.
