Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 7th: Hungary's national economy continues to improve. Industrial production in July improved further compared to previous months, even exceeding the production of July last year by 3%.

Hungarian economist István Foldes wrote in "People's Freedom" that as production increased, wages also slightly increased. The average wage of workers in state-owned enterprises was 1,404 forints in June and 1,480 forints in July. In the second quarter of this year, the wages of workers in state-owned enterprises increased by 23% compared to the same period last year, and the wages of administrative staff increased by 10%. Farmers' income in July also increased by 13% compared to the same period last year.

The article also stated that agricultural statistics prove that the Party's agricultural policy is correct. In the first half of this year, more than 900 agricultural production cooperatives were rebuilt and newly established. By the end of June, the cultivated land area of cooperatives nationwide accounted for 9.2% of the country's cultivated land area. This year, 26,000 members have joined or rejoined cooperatives. By the end of June, the total number of cooperative members nationwide was 122,456. The article mentioned that the profitability of enterprises is still a difficult problem, especially in coal mines. This is because the increase in wages has increased the expenditure of enterprises, and some enterprises have not fully utilized their production capacity. There are also many unhealthy phenomena in investment. Basic construction investment has not been reasonably reduced. Investment in construction has increased, while investment in improving machinery and equipment has decreased. Enterprises have not achieved the due accumulation of funds; on the contrary, they continue to decentralize investment, resulting in an increase of about 400 million forints in illegal investment.

When talking about foreign trade, the article pointed out that imports in July increased by 20% compared to the same period last year, while exports decreased by 15%.

    匈牙利国民经济情况继续好转
    七月份工业生产比去年同期提高3％
    据新华社布达佩斯7日电　匈牙利国民经济情况继续好转。7月份工业生产比前几月又提高了，甚至比去年7月生产还提高了3％。
    匈牙利经济学家佛耳德什·伊斯特万在“人民自由报”上著文说，随着生产的提高，工资也略有提高。国营企业工人6月份平均工资是一千四百零四福林，7月份是一千四百八十福林。今年第二季度，国营企业工人工资比去年同期提高了23％，行政工作人员工资提高了10％。农民在7月份的收入也比去年同期提高了13％。
    文章又说，农业方面的统计材料证明，党的农业政策是正确的。在今年上半年重建和新建了九百多个农业生产合作社，到6月底为止，全国合作社耕地面积占全国耕地面积的9.2％。今年加入或重新入社的社员有二万六千人。到6月底，全国社员总数为十二万二千四百五十六人。文章提到，企业的盈利还是一个困难问题，特别是在煤矿中。这是因为工资的提高增加了企业的支出，有些企业没有充分利用生产能力。在投资上也有许多不健康的现象，基本建设投资并没有合理减少。建筑的投资增加了，而改进机器设备的投资减少了。企业中没有实现应有的资金积累，相反地却继续分散投资，以至增加了不合法的投资约四亿福林。
    在谈到对外贸易的时候，文章指出，7月份进口比去年同期增加了20％，而出口减少了15％。
