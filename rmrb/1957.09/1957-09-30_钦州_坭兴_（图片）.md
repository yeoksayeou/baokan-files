Handicraft Introduction:

    Qinzhou "Nixing"
    Guo Weiqi
    Qinzhou "Nixing," which had ceased production for more than ten years due to the destruction of the Anti-Japanese War, has resumed production.

    "Nixing" is a kind of pottery produced in Qinzhou, Guangdong Province, that is famous at home and abroad for its excellent quality. It has a history of one hundred years and has won gold medals and awards of excellence at international craft product competitions and craft fairs in 1919 and 1929 respectively.

    "Nixing" products include more than sixty varieties such as vases, teapots, teacups, and coffee pots. Its unique advantages are: when peach and plum blossoms are inserted into the vase, they can blossom and bear fruit; tea stored in a "Nixing" teapot will not spoil for a long time, and after a period of time, tea flavor can be brewed from the pot without tea leaves.

    钦州“坭兴”
    郭伟祺
    因受抗日战争的破坏停顿生产十多年的钦州“坭兴”，又恢复生产了。
    “坭兴”是广东省钦州出产的一种闻名中外、品质精良的陶器。它已经有一百年的历史，并且在1919年和1929年曾先后获得国际工艺产品赛会、工艺品博览会的金牌奖章和优胜奖。
    “坭兴”产品有花瓶、茶壶、茶杯、咖啡壶等六十多种。它的独特的优点是：折桃李花枝，插在花瓶内能开花结果；用“坭兴”茶壶盛茶很久也不变味，而且经过一个时期后，不用茶叶也可以从壶内泡出茶味。（南方日报社稿）
