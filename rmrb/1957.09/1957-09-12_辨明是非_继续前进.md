　　Distinguish Right From Wrong and Continue to Advance
　　Liu Nianzhi, Deputy Manager of Shanghai Wool and Linen Textile Industry Company
    In the past, I was greatly influenced by the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Zhang Naiqi. Regarding his denial of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie, I once said that his intentions were good, and we should not beat him like a dog in the water.

    After the high tide of socialist transformation, I only thought of myself as a wealth of the people, and quite a bit of wealth at that! Didn't my father hand over 20 million yuan of means of production to the state? That should be enough to be worthy of the Communist Party, so what else is there to talk about transformation, let alone remolding my soul? Before the high tide, I tried every means to listen to the political reports made by the leaders. After the high tide, I rarely went to listen. When I was engaged in the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, I immediately reported any deviations of the public side to the higher authorities; when I heard about the bad tendencies of the private side, I was unwilling to report them. When I saw newspapers criticizing the private side, I felt disgusted and complained that the newspapers were exposing the ugliness of the business community. I especially opposed emphasizing class relations in the relationship between public and private partners. I even mistakenly proposed that the seniority of private personnel should be calculated in the same way as that of workers. All this shows how strong my bourgeois consciousness was, my original political stance had not completely changed, and how arrogant my complacency was. In essence, I was poisoned by Zhang Naiqi, and I also relaxed my continued socialist transformation, did not pay attention to the leadership of the working class, and denied that exploitation still existed after the high tide. For a period of time, I was greatly influenced by rightist ideology.

    It was not until the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce proposed that the struggle against Zhang Naiqi was a struggle between two roads that I was greatly surprised. In particular, Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people made me sober up. For several years since liberation, hasn't the Party been leading us on the road of peaceful transformation at all times? It has not only taken care of our lives, such as maintaining high salaries and providing fixed interest for seven years, but also cared about our work, such as arranging personnel according to their abilities. Zhang Naiqi, on the other hand, was intent on destroying our newly developed socialist feelings, dragging us back, and wanting us to take the capitalist road back. What a vicious means this is!

    Thinking calmly, it took me so many struggles in the past eight years to initially establish precious feelings with the working class.

    More than 20 years ago, I returned from England with a set of exploitation skills and managed the dock warehouse. The workers called me general manager to my face, but behind my back they called me "Fourth Young Master" and "Smiling Tiger." Precisely because I desperately wanted to make money regardless of the life and death of the workers, the lighting equipment at the dock was not good, and workers fell from the springboard in mid-air. I just pretended that nothing had happened. According to the rules of our Liu family enterprise, at most two hundred silver dollars and a thin coffin. There was also no safety equipment at all in the Huadong Coal Mine (i.e., Jiawang Coal Mine) that I was responsible for. Because there were frequent major casualties, the mine always had a few thin coffins ready. Sometimes workers were afraid of losing their lives after working for a few days and did not want to continue. We would support local bullies and gentry to set up casinos and brothels next to the mine to trick the workers out of their money and force them to go down the mine again to sell their lives. Zhang Naiqi said that we have a glorious tradition. May I ask, where is the glory? He also called us the red bourgeoisie. May I ask, where is the "red"? In 1950, when the coal mine was conducting asset verification, I was the representative of the private shareholders. At that time, someone told me that the workers in the mine were saying, "The capitalists exploited us so cruelly before, treating us worse than cattle and horses. We didn't settle accounts with him, but he dares to come and settle accounts with us." When I heard this, my legs went weak, and I braced myself and went to the mine's guest house. Many children surrounded the window and pointed at me, saying, "That fat one is the big capitalist." But the workers were still very polite to me and still sincere. Although some old workers were emotionally cold to me, they still came to shake hands with me. Thinking back to how cruel I was before liberation, but the workers did not bear old grudges, isn't this the noble quality of the working class's selflessness? Why did Zhang Naiqi maliciously say that there is essentially no difference between workers and bourgeois elements? What are his intentions?

    In the past few years, the mine has been completely transformed. Underground coal mining and transportation have been mostly mechanized, including the world's most advanced combined coal mining machine imported from the Soviet Union. The workers even get to use sun lamps after work. The mine has a 2,500-seat cinema, a beautiful park, and a perfectly equipped workers' sanatorium, as well as a fairly large cooperative. Acrobatic and dance troupes that perform abroad have gone to perform for the miners several times. We see workers everywhere neatly dressed, riding brand new bicycles. This is not only the liberation of the working class, but as an industrialist and businessman who accepts the leadership of the working class and accepts socialist transformation, I also feel proud. The rightists say that we don't need the leadership of the Communist Party, and the working class cannot lead socialist construction. This is really opening their eyes and talking nonsense.

    Following the great Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, I participated in the democratic reform movement. I heard a female underground Party member recount how she almost lost her family for the revolution. Her first child was raised in prison. I also heard a vice-chairman of the trade union recount that before liberation, a day's wages could not buy a few pancakes, and he watched his family die of illness and starvation. The whole audience cried, and I secretly shed tears. For the first time in my life, I felt why workers and capitalists had to be opposed, and why the working class hated the bourgeoisie so much. In the reactionary era, when workers suffered so much, we were engaged in gold and dollar speculation, eating, drinking, and making merry all day long. I felt in my heart that I was too sorry for the workers! I want to ask myself, isn't the 20 million yuan of assets the blood and sweat of thousands of workers? What do I have to be proud and complacent about? The fruits of workers' labor should all belong to the state, but in order to facilitate our acceptance of transformation, the workers not only did not pursue the past, but agreed to give us four horses to divide the profits, and after the high tide of joint ventures, they gave us fixed interest for seven years. The reactionary proposal of the insatiable and black-hearted rightist Li Kangnian for a fixed interest of 20 years is to make us ungrateful, deny exploitation, resist transformation, and make us confront the workers again. This extremely reactionary conspiracy aroused our great indignation. May I ask the rightist Li Kangnian, whose blood is shed in the revolution? Whose sweat is poured into socialist construction? How much difference is there between your life and the lives of the workers? Your deliberate attempt to undermine the Party's policy of peaceful transformation will not only be disallowed by the people of the whole country, but we industrialists and businessmen will also rise up to oppose you and smash your shameless conspiratorial activities.

    The rightists Wang Junliang, Wang Zijian, and others have consistently undermined socialist transformation and want us to support Zhang Naiqi in resisting the leadership of the working class. Based on my personal experience, when Zhanghua Factory initially lacked tasks, the state gave us loans, and the workers automatically reduced their wages to maintain the enterprise. The selfless and selfless labor of the workers of Zhanghua Factory successfully completed the first export task of 120,000 meters of high-grade worsted wool. Since the joint venture, under the leadership of the Party and public representatives, the enterprise has carried out a series of reforms and transformations. The quality of the entire wool textile industry has reached international standards, and more than 300 new varieties have been added. Even capitalist countries have come to us to place orders. Before liberation, under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, our country's valuable wool and silk raw materials, such as cashmere, rabbit hair, and camel hair, were cheaply exported to capitalist countries in large quantities, and then sold back to China as finished products at a price that was dozens or even dozens of times higher. Now, under the leadership of the Party, technicians and workers work together to use their brains and turn this national wealth into beautifully made finished products for export, adding millions of US dollars in foreign exchange to the country every year. In contrast, what else do the rightists have to say?

　　辨明是非　继续前进
　　上海毛麻纺织工业公司副经理　刘念智
    我过去受右派分子章乃器的反动言行影响比较大，对他否定资产阶级的两面性，我曾说他用心是好的，不要像打落水狗那样去打他。
    社会主义改造高潮后，我只认为自己是人民的财富，而且财富还不少呢！我父亲不是把二千万元的生产资料都交给国家了吗？总对得起共产党，还要谈啥改造，更不要说脱胎换骨了。高潮前我对首长做政治报告，想尽办法争取去听。高潮以后，我就很少去听了。我搞工商联工作，听到有关公方的偏差就立刻向上反映；听到私方不良倾向，就不愿反映。看到报纸批评私方，就起反感，埋怨报纸拿工商界显丑。我特别反对在公私共事关系中强调阶级关系。我更错误地提出私方人员工龄要同工人同样计算。这一切说明我的资产阶级意识多么浓厚，我原来的政治立场还没有完全转过来，我的骄傲自满情绪多么嚣张。实质上我中了章乃器的毒，也放松了继续进行社会主义改造，不重视工人阶级的领导，也否认了高潮后剥削还存在。我在一个时期，受到了右派思想的不少影响。
    直到民建工商联提出对章乃器是两条道路的斗争后，我才大吃一惊，特别毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，使我清醒过来了。解放几年来党不正是时时刻刻领着我们向和平改造的道路上走吗？既照顾到我们的生活，如高薪不减，定息七年，又关心到我们工作，如人事安排量才使用。而章乃器却一心想破坏我们刚生长起来的社会主义感情，拉我们的后腿，要我们走资本主义的回头路，这是何等毒辣的手段啊！
    平心来想，八年来通过多少斗争，我才和工人阶级初步地建立起珍贵的感情。
    二十多年前，我从英国学了一套剥削本领回来，管理码头仓库，工人当面喊我总经理，背后叫我“四太子”，“笑面虎”，正因为我不顾工人死活拚命想赚钱，码头照明设备不好，工人从跳板上半空跌下来，我只当无介事。按我们刘家企业规矩，大不了两百只洋钱，一只薄皮棺材。我负责的华东煤矿（即贾汪煤矿）里也完全没有安全设备。因为经常发生重大伤亡事故，矿上常备着几只薄皮棺材。有时工人做几天害怕送命不想干了，我们就支持土豪劣绅在矿场旁边摆赌场，开妓院，把工人的钱骗光，迫使他们再下井卖命。章乃器说我们有光荣的传统，试问光荣在那里？他还称我们是红色资产阶级，试问红在什么地方？1950年煤矿上进行清产核资工作，我是私股代表。当时有人告诉我，矿里工人都在说“资本家以前这样残酷的剥削我们，当我们不如牛马，我们没有清算他，他倒敢来清算我们了。”我听了脚骨软了，硬着头皮到了矿上的招待所。许多小孩围在窗外指着我说：“这胖胖的就是大资本家。”可是工人对我还是很有礼貌，还是诚恳的。有些老工人虽然感情上与我冷淡，但还是来和我拉手。回想解放前我是多么残酷，工人却不记前仇，这不是工人阶级大公无私的高贵品质是什么？为什么章乃器恶毒的说工人与资产阶级分子本质上没有区别？他的用心何在？
    这几年矿上已全部改观了，井下采煤，运输，大部分机械化了，包括从苏联运来的世界上最新式的康拜因采煤机。工人工作完了还照太阳灯。矿场有二千五百人座位的电影院，有美丽的公园，有设备完美的工人疗养院，规模相当大的合作社。出国表演的杂技歌舞团，有好几次去演出给矿工们看。我们到处看见工人衣冠整齐，骑着全新的脚踏车，这不但是工人阶级的翻身，我作为一个接受工人阶级领导，接受社会主义改造的工商业者也感到骄傲。右派分子说不要共产党领导，工人阶级不能领导社会主义建设，真是睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    接着三反五反伟大的运动后，我参加了民主改革运动。我听到了一位女地下党员控诉，她为了革命几乎家破人亡。她的第一个孩子是养在监牢里的。我也听到一位工会副主席控诉解放前的工资一天买不到几个大饼，眼看着家里人病死饿死，说得全场大哭，我也偷偷掉了眼泪。我生平第一次感到为什么工人与资本家要对立，为什么工人阶级那样仇恨资产阶级。反动时代工人吃尽苦头的时候，正是我们成天搞黄金美钞投机买卖、吃喝欢乐的时候。我内心感到我太对不起工人了！我要问问自己二千万元的资产不是千千万万工人的血汗是什么？我凭什么可以值得骄傲自满的呢？工人劳动的果实，照理应全部归国家所有，但是为了便于我们接受改造，工人不但不究既住，反而同意给我们四马分肥，合营高潮以后，还给我们定息七年。贪得无厌的黑心右派分子李康年定息二十年的反动建议，就是要我们忘恩负义的否定剥削抗拒改造，要我们再同工人对抗起来。这种反动到极点的阴谋，引起我们莫大的愤慨。试问右派分子李康年，革命流的是谁的血？社会主义建设出的是谁的汗？你的生活与工人的生活比比相差多少？你蓄意想破坏党的和平改造政策，非但全国人民不准许，就是我们工商业者也要起来反对你，打垮你的无耻阴谋活动。
    右派分子汪君良、王子建等，一贯破坏社会主义改造，要我们支持章乃器对抗工人阶级的领导。以我亲身的经历，当初章华厂任务不足，国家贷款给我们，工人自动削减工资把企业维持下来。章华厂工人大公无私的忘我劳动，出色地完成了第一次十二万公尺高级呢绒的出口任务。合营以来，在党与公方代表领导之下，企业进行了一连串的改革改造，整个毛纺织工业质量已达到国际水平，新品种增加了三百多种，连资本主义国家都纷纷要向我们订货。解放前在蒋介石反动政权统治下，把我国很宝贵的毛丝原料，山羊绒、兔子毛、骆驼毛，廉价地成批出口到资本主义国家去，做了成品增加十几倍甚至几十倍售价卖还给中国。现在呢，在党的领导之下，技术人员会同工人一起开动脑筋，把这批国家财富做成品质优美的成品出口，每年要为国家增加千百万美元的外汇。对比一下，右派分子还有什么话好讲呢？
