Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: TASS, Damascus, September 26th: The Syrian Arab Writers' Union's appeal to writers and literary figures worldwide, published here, states: A pre-planned aggression is threatening our country, Syria.

The only reason the United States is stirring up this wave is that Syria is a free country, Syria has strengthened its independence, and Syria believes that its Arab nationalism and its policy of positive neutrality are conducive to strengthening the cause of universal peace. It is precisely Syria's firm stance that has angered American imperialism and caused it to oppose the liberation movement. In this struggle, American imperialism has tried all means: economic pressure, "cold war," conspiracies, and slander. These cunning methods have failed in the face of the Syrian people's perseverance, awareness, and determination to safeguard their independence.

The movement of the US Sixth Fleet, the concentration of Turkish and Israeli troops, and the visits of US military delegations to some countries bordering Syria all prove this new movement launched by the United States.

Today's international tensions have much in common with the tensions before the invasion of Egypt. At that time, the whole world stood with the Egyptian people in the struggle against aggression. The loud calls and angry protests of writers and literary figures around the world played a huge role in this regard.

We Syrian writers call on writers and literary figures around the world to issue a noble call to defend Syria, because the threat to Syria is a threat to the whole world.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 26th: The Third Arab Lawyers' Conference closed on the evening of the 25th. The resolutions passed by the conference show that Arab lawyers are indignant at the United States' conspiratorial activities and its plans to invade Syria. The resolution pointed out that the US imperialists' interference in Syria's internal affairs is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter.

The resolution also paid tribute to Egypt for nationalizing the Suez Canal last year.

The resolution expressed full support for the Algerian people's struggle against French imperialism. The conference also decided to send a telegram to the United Nations demanding an end to British aggression in Oman.

    叙作家联盟谴责美国侵略阴谋
    呼吁全世界作家声援叙利亚
    阿拉伯律师代表会斥美国干涉叙内政
    据新华社27日讯　塔斯社大马士革26日讯：在这里发表的叙利亚阿拉伯作家联盟告世界作家和文学家书说：预先筹划好的侵略正在威胁着我们的国家叙利亚。
    美国所以要挑起这种浪潮的唯一原因在于叙利亚是一个自由的国家、叙利亚加强了自己的独立并且相信自己的阿拉伯民族主义和自己的积极中立政策有利于加强普遍和平事业。正是叙利亚的这种坚强立场触怒了美国帝国主义起来反对解放运动。在这场斗争中美帝国主义试用了一切手段：经济压力、“冷战”、阴谋和诽谤。这些狡诈的手段在叙利亚人民的坚忍不拔的精神和自觉性以及叙利亚人民维护自己的独立的决心面前破产了。
    美国第六舰队的调动、土耳其军队和以色列军队的集结、美国军事代表团对叙利亚的一些毗邻国家进行的访问都证明了美国发起的这个新运动。
    今天的国际紧张局势同在侵略埃及之前的紧张局势有许多共同点。当时全世界都站在为反对侵略而斗争的埃及人民一边。全世界的作家和文学家大声疾呼和愤怒的抗议在这方面起了巨大作用。
    我们叙利亚的作家们呼吁全世界的作家和文学家发出崇高的呼声来保卫叙利亚，因为对叙利亚的威胁就是对全世界的威胁。
    据新华社大马士革26日电　第三届阿拉伯律师代表大会已经在25日晚上闭幕。大会通过的决议表明，阿拉伯律师都对美国的阴谋活动以及美国策划侵略叙利亚的行为感到愤慨。决议指出：美帝国主义者干涉叙利亚内政是公然违背联合国宪章的行为。
    决议还为了埃及去年把苏伊士运河收归国有而向埃及致敬。
    决议表示全力支援阿尔及利亚人民反对法帝国主义的斗争。代表大会还决定打电报给联合国要求制止英国在阿曼进行的侵略。
