Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 22nd: In the struggle against bourgeois rightists, the mental outlook of engineering and technical personnel at the Southwest Industrial Architectural Design Institute has greatly changed. Many people who usually didn't pay much attention to politics have become active defenders of the socialist cause. The number of people actively applying to join the Communist Party and seeking to strengthen their study of Marxist-Leninist political theory has increased.

At the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, many people at the design institute did not expect that there would be people around them who were anti-communist and anti-socialist, believing that there were "no rightists" within the institute. Later, everyone earnestly studied Chairman Mao's documents such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," which improved their ability to distinguish right from wrong. Many veteran engineers stepped forward, comparing the past with the present, and sternly refuted the rightists' attempts to stir up dissatisfaction among young engineering and technical personnel with the Communist Party and the new society. Veteran engineer Zhou Xuekai said that he was unemployed after graduating from university before liberation and ran a cigarette stall in Guizhou for three years. The rightists claimed that "the new society did not make good use of technical talents," which is nonsense. Engineer Xu Shangzhi listed some facts he witnessed when he was a lecturer at a university in Chongqing before liberation, refuting the rightists' agitation of young engineering and technical personnel to be dissatisfied with their current work. He said that in the architecture department of this university, only five or six out of a class of twenty-odd students found jobs, and three of them even shared a university teaching assistant position, collectively earning a meager salary. Engineer Xu also recounted the unfortunate experience of a student: this young man was full of enthusiasm and wanted to be a good architect after graduation, but the first assignment he encountered was to design and build a toilet in the mansion of a large Sichuan warlord. The warlord was dissatisfied and even slapped him.

The design institute has successively exposed fourteen rightist elements. When the movement reached its climax, more than forty engineers and all technical and administrative personnel in the institute actively participated in the anti-rightist struggle. Engineer Wu Ziliang, who has more than ten years of architectural design experience, was previously unconcerned about political activities. This time, he said with deep emotion: "In the past, I was not humble enough. I thought that I had transformed myself quite a bit in the past seven years and that it was enough to do my job well. This time, I realized that I was wrong." He is the chief person in charge of several important design projects and is very busy, but he personally took the lead in chairing the meetings and refuting the rightists. Sometimes, he even stayed up late to write his speech outline. Many veteran engineers actively participated in meetings of all sizes, and their speeches mostly compared their personal experiences in the old society with the new society, which were particularly forceful and greatly educated the young engineering and technical personnel. Many young engineering and technical personnel, from the fact that most of the exposed rightists were young people from exploiting families, felt even more the need to carry out self-transformation well.

### 平时不问政治的人积极起来反击右派  西南工业建筑设计院技术人员觉悟提高

    平时不问政治的人积极起来反击右派
    西南工业建筑设计院技术人员觉悟提高
    据新华社重庆22日电　西南工业建筑设计院在反资产阶级右派斗争中，工程技术人员的精神面貌大为改观。许多平时不大过问政治的人成了捍卫社会主义事业的积极分子；主动申请加入共产党和积极要求加强马列主义政治理论学习的人增多了。
    这个设计院在反右派斗争开始时，不少人没有料想到在自己身旁就有人反共、反社会主义，认为院内“没有右派分子”。后来大家认真学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”等有关文件，提高了辨别能力；许多老工程师挺身而出，对比今昔，严辞批驳右派分子挑拨青年工程技术人员对共产党和新社会的不满。老工程师周学楷说，他解放以前在大学毕业以后便失业，在贵州摆了三年香烟摊，右派分子认为“新社会没有很好使用技术人才”，这真是胡说。徐尚志工程师列举他解放以前在重庆一个大学作讲师时亲眼看到的一些事实，驳斥右派分子煽动青年工程技术人员不安心现有工作。他说，这个大学的建筑系，有一班二十几个学生毕业，只有五、六人找到职业，而且有三人是共补一个大学助教的缺位，合领一分微薄的薪金。徐工程师还介绍了一个学生的不幸遭遇：这位青年满腔热忱地想在出校以后当一个好建筑师，但首先碰到的一分差使，却是给四川一个大军阀设计修建公馆里的厕所，这个军阀感到不如意，还打了他一顿耳光。
    这个设计院先后揭露出十四个右派分子。当运动达到高潮时，全院四十多个工程师和所有技术、行政人员都积极参加了反右派斗争。具有十多年建筑设计经验的工程师吴子梁过去对政治活动不关心，这次他感慨很深地说：“过去我不够虚心，以为七年来自己已经改造得差不多了，认为只要作好工作就行，这次才知道自己想错了。”他是好几个重要设计项目的总负责人，非常忙，却亲自担任主席，带头在会上反驳右派分子，有时深夜还在赶写发言提纲。不少老工程师大小会议都积极参加，发言大都以在旧社会的亲身遭遇同新社会作对比，驳得特别有力，对青年工程技术人员的教育很大。许多年轻的工程技术人员从揭露出的右派分子多数是剥削家庭出身的青年这一事实，更加感到需要很好地进行自我改造。
