Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th - Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, today once again sent a telegram to the President and member states of the United Nations Security Council, requesting the Security Council not to discuss the United Nations General Assembly's proposal to reconsider accepting South Vietnam into the United Nations, and to reject South Vietnam's application to join the United Nations.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong had sent a telegram to the Security Council with the same request on January 25th of this year; however, under the manipulation of the United States, the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly still adopted the aforementioned proposal on February 28th of this year and submitted it to the Security Council for discussion at its meeting to be held on September 9th.

In his telegram to the Security Council, Pham Van Dong emphasized that Vietnam is an indivisible whole. He pointed out that the 1954 Geneva Accords had recognized the principle of Vietnam's unification and territorial integrity and stipulated measures for achieving Vietnam's unification. Therefore, South Vietnam cannot be considered a separate country and the legitimate representative of the entire Vietnam. The South Vietnamese regime's action of applying to join the United Nations is a complete violation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

The telegram stated that the resolution previously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly was, in effect, intended to allow the South Vietnamese regime to join the United Nations as the representative of the entire Vietnam. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that this resolution not only violates the Geneva Accords but also violates the Charter of the United Nations.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that South Vietnam has repeatedly refused to consult with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of unification in accordance with the Geneva Accords and has actively sought to join the United Nations in order to legitimize activities aimed at permanently dividing Vietnam. In this situation, the aforementioned resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on February 28th is not beneficial to the cause of unifying the country currently underway in Vietnam, nor is it beneficial to consolidating peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

### 范文同要求安理会  不考虑接受南越加入联合国

    范文同要求安理会
    不考虑接受南越加入联合国
    新华社河内7日电　越南民主共和国外交部长范文同今天再一次打电报给联合国安全理事会的主席和理事国，要求安全理事会不要讨论联合国大会关于再次考虑接受南越加入联合国的提案，并且拒绝南越的关于加入联合国的申请。
    范文同总理在今年1月25日曾经打电报给安全理事会提出过同样的要求；但是，在美国的操纵下，第十一届联合国大会在今年2月28日仍然通过了上述提案，并且提交安全理事会将在9月9日举行的会议讨论。
    范文同在给安全理事会的电报中强调指出，越南是一个不可分割的整体。他指出，1954年的日内瓦协定已经承认了越南统一和领土完整的原则，并且规定了实现越南统一的措施。因此，南越不能被认为是一个单独的国家和整个越南的合法代表。南越政权申请加入联合国的行动，是完全违反日内瓦协议的规定的。
    电报说，联合国大会以前通过的决议，实际上是要让南越政权以代表整个越南的身份加入联合国。越南民主共和国认为这个决议不仅违反日内瓦协议，而且还违背了联合国宪章。
    范文同指出，南越一再拒绝按照日内瓦协议就统一问题同越南民主共和国政府进行协商，并且积极活动要求加入联合国，以便使永远分裂越南的活动合法化。在这种情况下，联合国大会在2月28日通过的上述决议，对越南目前正在进行的统一国家的事业没有好处，对巩固越南和东南亚的和平也没有好处。
