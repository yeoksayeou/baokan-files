Moments Relating to a Person's Life
Introducing the Egyptian Film "Life and Death"
Ma Shaobo

The first shot of the film "Life and Death" features a large clock, ticking away relentlessly.

The film's first line says: "Our lives are like this clock. One moment may seem insignificant, but sometimes it is a decisive moment."

Then, the film shows the beautiful and tranquil Nile River.

A very intimate voice continues to tell us: "The struggle for life is raging. Life, like this immortal river, flows on forever!"

This poetic metaphor at the beginning of the film hints at the theme. The cleverness lies in this hint; it doesn't reveal everything at a glance. You must watch the entire film, savor it carefully, to understand the profound meaning of why life is like the Nile, flowing endlessly.

It seems like a very ordinary story. A small clerk named Ahmed Ibrahim is fired by a capitalist before the New Year due to a serious illness and is refused severance pay. After Ibrahim returns home, he suggests selling furniture to raise some money for the New Year, but his wife suggests that the whole family go to her mother's house for the New Year, leading to a quarrel in the small family. The wife angrily takes their daughter back to her mother's house, but sends the daughter back to accompany her father midway, and she returns to her mother's house alone.

After the wife leaves, Ibrahim's old illness recurs. Their eight-year-old daughter, Samira, takes the only twenty-five piastres (Egyptian currency) to the street to buy medicine, but the nearby pharmacies are already closed. Samira has to go to a pharmacy that is open day and night far away. The pharmacist is mentally distraught because his only son recently died. He makes a mistake when dispensing the medicine. This incorrectly mixed medicine will immediately kill the patient upon contact with their lips. The conflict of the plot unfolds deeply from here.

After Samira leaves, the pharmacist discovers the error. A solemn sense of responsibility spurs him on. He frantically searches for the patient's address according to the name on the prescription, but cannot find it. Finally, he has to run to the police station for help. The police station finally agrees to notify all police officers to search on the city's trams, buses, and streets for an eight-year-old girl holding a bottle of medicine. Within a short thirty minutes, almost all the girls around eight years old on the trams and streets in the city are brought in, but none of them are her. Because the pedestrians don't know why the girls are being caught, everyone is surprised. A kind-hearted boy takes Samira and escapes from the alley.

Faced with the death of a good person, at this decisive moment, the pharmacist is as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. Finally, the police station broadcasts an emergency notice through the radio. All the patients in the city who are taking medicine at this time panic and throw away their medicine bottles. Ibrahim's wife unintentionally hears the broadcast at her mother's house and runs home desperately. At this time, Samira, in order to save her father's life, is also rushing home. The daughter arrives home first. She hurriedly pours boiling water to help her father take the medicine. At this critical moment, just as Ibrahim raises the cup to swallow the poisonous medicine, his wife breaks down the door and knocks it away with one hand.

Of course, the story is not that simple. There are many complex and specific details in it. The reason why I want to talk about the outline is just to illustrate that it seems like an ordinary story, but it contains such a solemn theme and rich ideological content.

People's demands for art are not only that the works put forward those urgent issues that society is concerned about, but also require something more important, that is, to show the new qualities in people's spiritual outlook and to enrich people's spiritual life with this beautiful ideological quality.

"Life and Death" reveals exactly this to us. It describes the deeply moving emotional connection between husband and wife, father and daughter, doctor and patient, children and children, and people and people; it vividly portrays the Egyptian people's kind character of loving life and their noble spiritual outlook, and the new humanistic spirit is fully embodied.

I deeply admire the author's observation ability, generalization ability, and the performance talents of the director and actors. The entire film is full of life, writing about people and life, true, vivid, delicate and insightful. The plot is compact, concentrated, specific, and lively. It not only expresses the people's lofty qualities and the passion to overcome difficulties through artistic images, but also has the simple truth of depicting daily life details. In terms of artistic expression, the techniques of exaggeration and contrast are boldly used, which greatly enhances the tension, suspense, and depth of the plot. For example, when Ibrahim's wife and daughter are running home separately at almost the same time, each with the same kind motive of saving their loved ones, people are so worried. Who arrives home first can produce two completely opposite results for life: survival or death. The author and director exaggerate and render this plot in a concentrated way, and the effect is very good. There are many such examples, so I won't list them one by one.

As a comedy, it has a unique style. Here, many life details are interspersed around the central contradiction, and almost every detail is full of humor. Generally speaking, humor is loved by everyone, and it is also loved by artists themselves; but in artistic processing, making people laugh is easy to achieve, but making people laugh sincerely without reluctance is extremely difficult. The humor in "Life and Death" in handling details is really full of wit and interest. Even the most coincidental plot makes people convinced and makes people feel that it is truly life, it is the enjoyment of art. This is because it is handled delicately and naturally, in line with the rhythm of life, and artistic exaggeration is carried out strictly on the basis of the reality of life.

Almost every actor in the film doesn't have many scenes, but every actor's scene is important. It doesn't add scenes stiffly and randomly to show the protagonist. There is a unified image center here, which is "struggling for life." Although Ahmed Ibrahim is the protagonist of the play, the representative of life, and the object of suspense; the actors absolutely obey the needs of the plot, and it is enough to act appropriately, which is extremely rare. Therefore, the conflict of the play can be unfolded tensely, and the plot can be fully developed, so that we can see the theme they want to express not only from the protagonist, but also from many other roles. In particular, the innocent and lovely little character of Samira occupies a very important position in the whole play. This little actor performs very well. Please allow me to bless her and bless the future of the Egyptian people's film industry!

The film "Life and Death" is a exquisite work of art. It is no exaggeration to say that almost every picture, every expression, every dialogue, has been carefully designed and meticulously carved. I cannot give examples in this short article. The audience only needs to look at the ending shot of the film, a very ordinary life shot. Please see how it handles the picture, how it handles the characters' emotions and mutual relationships, and you can generally summarize it.

Writing here, I think of the large clock that never stops and the beautiful, long-flowing Nile River again.

Time has never stopped and will never cease.

Although the Nile River is sometimes gentle and tranquil, and sometimes turbulent and roaring, no one will forget that in the past, present, and future, it has always been immortal, unceasing, continuous, and unremitting.

Life is always moving forward vividly and lively, one moment after another, one wave after another. When the noble and kind people's spirit grasps the decisive moment, life will cross many waves and get better development.

    关系到一个人的生命的时刻
    介绍埃及影片“生与死”
    马少波
    “生与死”影片的第一个镜头，出现了一座大时钟，滴打滴打不停地行进着。
    影片第一句话，这样说：“我们的生命就像这座钟一样。一个时刻不算什么，但有时候这是一个决定的时刻。”
    接着影片上又出现了美丽平静的尼罗河。
    一种极亲切的声音继续告诉我们说：“为生命而进行的斗争正在热火朝天地进行着。生命，永远像这条不朽的河一样长流不断！”
    影片一开始的这种富有诗意的比喻，把主题思想暗示给我们。巧妙的在于这种暗示，它不让你一眼望穿，你必须看完它的全部内容，细细地寻味，才会懂得为什么生命像尼罗河一样长流不断的深意。
    看来好像是一个极平凡的故事。一个叫作阿赫迈德·易卜拉欣的小职员，因为患了重病，在新年前被资本家解雇了，并且拒绝发给他解雇金。易卜拉欣回家以后，主张卖家具筹点款过年，妻子却主张全家到她的娘家去过年，于是小家庭中发生了一场争执。妻子负气带了女儿回娘家去，但是中途又让女儿回来陪爸爸，她独自回到了娘家。
    妻子走后，易卜拉欣的旧病复发，八岁的女儿萨米拉拿着仅有的二十五个披亚斯特（埃币名）上街买药，可是附近的药房已经关门了，萨米拉只得到很远的一家日夜不息的药房去买。药剂师因为最近死了独生子，精神十分恍惚，在他配药的时候，出了差错。这种配错了的药只要病人一沾唇就会立刻死亡的。剧情的冲突，就从这里深入地展开了。
    萨米拉走后，药剂师发现了错误。庄严的责任感鞭策着他，他若癫若狂地按着药方上病人的名字到处寻找病人的住址，但是找不到，最后，他只得跑到警察厅去求救。警察厅终于答应他通知所有警察在全市的电车上、汽车上、街道上去寻找一个八岁的、手中拿着一瓶药的小女孩。在短短的三十分钟内，几乎把全市在电车上、街道上八岁左右的女孩都捉来了，但偏偏都不是。因为行人不知道为什么捉女孩子，个个惊讶，一个好心的男孩子便带了萨米拉从小巷逃掉了。
    面临着一个善良的人的死亡，就在这一个决定的时刻，药剂师急得像热锅蚂蚁。最后，警察厅通过电台播送了紧急通知。全市正在这时候服药的所有病人纷纷惊慌地扔掉了自己的药瓶。易卜拉欣的妻子在娘家无意中听到广播，也不顾一切地往自己的家里奔跑。这时萨米拉为了挽救爸爸的生命，也是急急忙忙赶回家去。女儿先到了家，她急忙倒开水服侍爸爸吃药。就在这一发千钧的一刹那，易卜拉欣正端起杯子要吞服毒药的时候，被妻子破门而入一手打掉了。
    当然故事不只是这样简单，其中还有很多复杂的具体情节，我所以要说说梗概，只是为了说明看来好像是一个平凡的故事，但这里面却包含着多么庄严的主题和丰富的思想内容。
    人们对待艺术，不仅要求作品提出社会所关切的那些紧要的问题，而且要求一种更重要的东西，就是表现出人的精神面貌中的新品质，并且以这种优美的思想品质，丰富人民的精神生活。
    “生与死”所揭示给我们的正是这样。它描写夫妻之间、父女之间、医生和病人之间、孩子和孩子之间、人民和人民之间休戚相关的感情联系是如此的深切动人；它十分集中地刻划出埃及人民爱生活的善良性格和高尚的精神面貌，新的人道主义精神得到了充分体现。
    我是深深地对作者的观察能力、概括能力和导演、演员的表现才能表示敬佩的。整个影片充满着生活气息，写人，写生活，真实生动，细腻入微。情节紧凑集中、具体、活泼，不仅通过艺术形象表现出人民的崇高品质和克服困难的激情，同时还有描写日常生活细节的那种质朴的真实。在艺术表现上，大胆地使用了夸张和对比的手法，大大增强了剧情紧张、惊险、深刻的深度。举例说吧，易卜拉欣的妻子和女儿几乎在同一个时间内，各自抱着同一个拯救自己亲人的善良动机分头往家跑的时刻，人们是这样地耽心着，谁先跑到家，对于生命可以产生两种完全相反的结果：生存或死亡。作者和导演在这种情节上集中地夸张渲染，效果是很好的，这样的例子很多，不一一列举了。
    作为一个喜剧来讲，它是具有独特风格的。这里围绕着中心矛盾穿插了很多生活细节，几乎每个细节都充满着幽默。一般的说，幽默是人人所喜欢的，也是艺术家自己所喜欢的；但是在艺术处理上，使人发笑是容易作到的，使人毫不勉强的由衷的笑却是极困难的。“生与死”处理细节的幽默，真是谐趣横生。那怕是极巧合的情节，也使人信服，使人感到真正是生活，是艺术的享受。这就是因为它处理的细腻自然，处处合乎生活的拍子，严格地在生活真实的基础上进行艺术夸张的原故。
    影片几乎每个演员的戏都不多，但是每个演员的戏都重要，它不为了主角而去枝枝蔓蔓地生硬地加戏。这里有一个统一的形象中心，是“为生命而斗争”。尽管阿赫迈德·易卜拉欣是戏的主人公，是生命的代表，是悬念的对象；但是演员绝对服从剧情的需要，把戏作到恰如其分就够了，这是极难得的。因此，戏的冲突得以紧张的展开，剧情得到充分的发展，使我们不只从主人公身上，也从另外许多角色的身上看出他们所要表现的主题思想。特别是天真可爱的萨米拉这个小角色，在整个戏里占着很重要的位置，这位小演员演得很出色，请允许我为她祝福，为埃及人民电影事业的未来祝福！
    “生与死”影片是一部精美的艺术品，一点也不夸张地说，几乎每一个画面，每一个表情，每一句对话，都是经过匠心设计精雕细刻的，我无法在这篇短文中举例说明，观众们只要看看影片的收尾的那个镜头，一个很平常的生活的镜头，请看它是怎样处理画面，怎样处理人物的感情和相互关系的，就可以概括一般了。
    写到这里，我又想起那座不停的大时钟和美丽的长流不息的尼罗河来了。
    时间从来没有停歇过，也永远不会休止。
    尼罗河虽然有时候温和宁静，有时候奔腾叫啸，但是谁也不会忘记，过去、现在、将来，她一直是不朽、不停、不断、不息的。
    生命，永远生动活泼地前进着，一个时刻接一个时刻，一个浪头跟一个浪头。当高尚善良的人民精神掌握住决定性的时刻的时候，生命就会越过重重浪头，得到更好的发展。
