Comrades Delegates! Dear Guests!

    The Third National Women's Congress of China is now drawing to a victorious close. Our congress has been conducted under the leadership and care of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Through the concerted efforts of the one thousand two hundred and sixty-odd delegates from more than forty ethnic groups and all the staff present, our congress has victoriously completed its expected tasks.

    The gains of this congress are enormous. Throughout the congress, the vast majority of delegates, whether in group meetings or in plenary sessions, actively spoke and enthusiastically discussed, making our congress truly a great classroom for counterattacking right-wing elements and distinguishing between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Everyone used concrete facts and powerful arguments to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois right-wing elements among the delegates, more clearly demarcated the boundaries between socialism and capitalism, more fully demonstrated the superiority of socialism, and more firmly resolved to follow the Communist Party on the road to socialism. All of this has played a positive role in helping everyone pass the test of socialism.

    Throughout the congress, the vast majority of delegates, based on the tasks facing the country and their own experiences, conscientiously discussed the policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift, and extensively exchanged work experiences, making it clearer to everyone that this policy is not only the correct and fundamental policy for our country to build socialism, but also the fundamental policy guiding women's work. The entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of considering diligence and thrift as honorable, and laziness and waste as shameful, making our congress truly a congress to mobilize women throughout the country to further implement the principle of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift.

    Our congress also revised the Constitution of the All-China Women's Federation and elected the Third Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation.

    We firmly believe that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and based on the new policies and tasks determined by this congress, and under the guidance of the new leading bodies of the All-China Women's Federation, women throughout the country will achieve a broader and more solid unity on the basis of socialism, and will make greater contributions to building a socialist motherland and creating a better future for women and children.

    For more than thirty years, in the process of leading the entire revolution, the Communist Party of China has always attached unswerving importance to the strength of women, cared for the interests of women, and led women to establish their own organizations. Through this women's organization, it has united and educated the broad masses of women and the people of the whole country to achieve the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. In recent years, it has relied on this organization—the Women's Federation—to unite and educate the broad masses of women to struggle for the cause of socialist construction. After many years of practice, it has proven that such a women's organization is the most suitable organizational form for China's conditions, and it is needed not only during the revolutionary period, but also throughout the entire process of building a socialist society after the victory of the revolution. It is needed not only when women are not liberated, but also after women are liberated. Women's work is an important and indispensable part of building socialism. We must earnestly and firmly undertake our glorious responsibility and persevere in our hard work!

    Our congress delegates, on various production fronts, work posts, and in families, care about and promote women's work in various related fields, and can play a significant role in developing women's work throughout the country. Many of us have already made satisfactory efforts. We earnestly hope that women representatives of all ethnic groups, classes, work posts, and families throughout the country will regard women's work as their own glorious responsibility, consciously and continuously strive to make new achievements in completing the tasks of women's work in the future.

    The Third Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation elected at this congress, and the numerous women workers in women's federations at all levels throughout the country, should, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, closely connect with the broad masses of women, strengthen cooperation with relevant parties, and strive to complete the tasks determined by the congress. We must recognize the long-term and arduous nature of women's work, make long-term plans, guard against arrogance and impatience, go deep into the masses, study our profession, and resolutely overcome difficulties from all sides, and bring greater initiative and creativity to our work. At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to study Marxism-Leninism, improve our political level, and improve the quality of our work to meet the needs of the increasingly developing construction of our motherland.

    Dear Delegates! The congress has strengthened our love for the motherland, for the Communist Party, and for socialism, and has enhanced our confidence and enthusiasm in socialist construction. We must turn confidence and enthusiasm into practical actions. In the future, our duty is to publicize and implement the spirit and resolutions of the congress among women of all ethnic groups and classes through various occasions and opportunities, so that the resolutions of the congress become the conscious actions of the broad masses of women, building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift, and striving to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country.

    This congress not only demonstrated the great unity of Chinese women, but also demonstrated the great unity between the women of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. The representatives of women's organizations from socialist countries introduced us to the actual conditions of their countries, powerfully proving that only the socialist system can liberate women and create a better life for women and children. This has given all of us a vivid education in socialism and internationalism. The women representatives from various countries and the representatives sent by the International Women's Federation who attended the congress brought us sincere friendship and beautiful wishes for Chinese women, and gave us various beautiful and precious gifts. Please allow me to express my deep gratitude to them once again on behalf of the congress and Chinese women! At the same time, we would also like to ask them to convey the warm friendship and determination to defend world peace of Chinese women to their sisters in various countries, so as to further enhance our mutual understanding and make our deep friendship more consolidated and developed.

    Long live the great unity of Chinese women!

    Long live the great unity of women of the world!

    在全国妇女第三次代表大会上
    邓颖超致闭幕词亲爱的代表们！亲爱的来宾们！
    中国妇女第三次全国代表大会现在要胜利的闭幕了。我们的大会是在中国共产党中央委员会的领导和关怀下进行的。我们的大会在到会的四十多个民族的一千二百六十多位代表和全体工作人员的一致努力下，已经胜利地完成了预期的任务。
    这次大会的收获是巨大的。在整个大会期间，绝大多数代表无论在小组会上，在大会上，都踊跃发言，热烈讨论，使我们的大会真正成了反击右派分子，分辨社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大讲堂。大家用确切的事实和有力的论据，揭发和批驳了这次大会代表中的资产阶级右派分子的反动言行，更明确地划清了社会主义与资本主义的界限，更充分地证明了社会主义的优越性，更坚定了跟共产党走社会主义道路的决心。这一切，对大家过好社会主义这一关，起了积极的推动作用。
    在整个大会期间，绝大多数代表根据国家所面临的任务和亲身的经历，认真地讨论了勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，广泛地交流了工作经验，使大家更明确了这个方针不仅是我国建设社会主义的正确的根本方针，而且也是指导妇女工作的根本方针。整个会场上充满了勤劳节俭为荣，懒惰浪费为耻的气氛，使我们的大会真正成了动员全国妇女更进一步贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家的大会。
    我们的大会还改订了中华人民共和国妇女联合会的章程，选出了中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会的第三届执行委员会。
    我们深信，全国妇女在中国共产党的领导下，根据这次大会所确定的新的方针和任务，在全国妇联新的领导机构指导之下，必将在社会主义基础上达到更广泛更巩固的团结，必将对建设社会主义祖国和创造妇女儿童更美好的未来作出更大的贡献。
    三十多年来，中国共产党在领导整个革命的过程中，始终不渝地重视妇女群众的力量，关怀妇女群众的利益，领导妇女群众建立了自己的组织。通过这个妇女自己的组织团结和教育了广大妇女和全国人民一起，取得了人民民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利。近几年来，又依靠了这一组织——妇女联合会，团结、教育了广大妇女为社会主义建设事业而奋斗。经过多年来的实践，证明这样的妇女组织是一种最适合中国情况的组织形式，不仅在革命时期需要它，就是在革命胜利之后，在建成社会主义社会的整个过程中也还需要它。不仅在妇女没有解放的时候需要它，就是在妇女解放之后，依旧需要它。妇女工作是建设社会主义中一项重要的不可缺少的工作。我们一定要认真地、坚定地承担起自己的光荣责任，坚持不懈的努力工作吧！
    我们的大会代表，在各种生产战线上、工作岗位上和家庭中，关怀和推动各有关方面的妇女工作，对开展全国妇女工作是能够起很大作用的。我们之中已经有很多人曾作过令人满意的努力。我们殷切地希望全国各民族各阶层各种工作岗位和家庭中的妇女代表人物，都能将妇女工作作为自己的光荣责任，自觉地不断地努力，为完成今后的妇女工作任务作出新的成就。
    在这次大会上选出的中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会第三届执行委员会，和全国各级妇联组织中为数众多的妇女工作者，应在各级党委领导下，密切联系广大妇女群众，加强与有关方面的协作，为完成大会所决定的任务而奋斗。我们必须认清妇女工作的长期性和艰巨性，作长期打算，戒骄戒躁，深入群众，钻研业务，坚决克服来自各方面的困难，在工作中发挥更大的积极性和创造性。同时，我们要倍加努力地学习马列主义，提高政治水平，提高工作质量，以适应祖国建设日益发展的需要。
    亲爱的代表们！大会加强了我们对祖国、对共产党、对社会主义的热爱，提高了我们对社会主义建设的信心和热情。我们要把信心和热情变为实际行动。今后我们的职责就是通过各种场合、各种机会，把大会的精神决议宣传和贯彻到各民族、各阶层妇女群众中去，使大会的决议成为广大妇女群众的自觉行动，勤俭建国，勤俭持家，为把我国建设成为繁荣富强的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    这次大会，不仅表现了中国妇女的大团结，也表现了以苏联为首的社会主义国家妇女之间的大团结。社会主义各国妇女组织的代表，向我们介绍了她们国家的实际情况，有力地证明了只有社会主义的制度才能解放妇女，才能为妇女儿童创造美好的生活。使我们大家都受了一次生动的社会主义和国际主义的教育。这次出席大会的各国妇女代表和国际妇联派来的代表给我们带来了诚挚的友谊和对中国妇女的美好愿望，并且送给我们各种美丽珍贵的礼品，请允许我代表大会和中国妇女再一次向她们表示深深的谢意！同时，我们还要请她们把中国妇女热诚的友谊和保卫世界和平的决心转达给各国的姊妹，从而更增进我们相互间的了解，使我们之间的深厚友谊更加巩固，更加发展。
    中国妇女大团结万岁！
    世界妇女大团结万岁！
