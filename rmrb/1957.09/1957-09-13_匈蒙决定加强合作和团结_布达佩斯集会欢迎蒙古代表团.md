Xinhua News Agency Compilation: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The government delegations of Hungary and the Mongolian People's Republic issued a joint statement on the afternoon of September 11 in Budapest regarding their talks.

The statement said that the government delegations of the two countries held talks in a friendly and sincere atmosphere, discussing current international issues, further developing economic, cultural, and scientific cooperation between the two countries, and strengthening the unity of socialist camp countries. Both sides reached a consensus on these major issues.

The statement said that the two governments support the Soviet Union's efforts on disarmament and the prohibition and cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

The statement pointed out that Hungary and the Mongolian People's Republic firmly condemn the imperialists' constant interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries and sympathetically watch the struggle of the people of these countries for freedom and independence.

The two countries firmly condemn the Western countries' conspiracy against Hungary in the United Nations. The two governments firmly condemn the United States and its vassal states for obstructing the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations at the recent Security Council meeting.

The statement mentioned that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia invited Prime Minister Kádár to visit Mongolia, and Kádár accepted the invitation.

The statement concluded by saying that both sides expressed their continued efforts to consolidate the unity of the socialist camp.

On the same day, the delegations of the two parties of Hungary and Mongolia also held talks. The joint communiqué issued after the talks stated that the two party delegations discussed major international issues related to the two parties and the mutual relations between the two parties on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles. The two sides held consistent views on these issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 12: More than 3,000 representatives of the working people of the Hungarian capital held a rally on the afternoon of September 11 to welcome the Mongolian government delegation headed by Tsedenbal.

Kádár and Tsedenbal spoke at the meeting.

Kádár said that our two countries have a common goal—building socialism. When we suffered counter-revolutionary attacks, the Mongolian people gave us great assistance. We would like to express our gratitude again here.

Kádár then condemned the United Nations for including the so-called "Hungarian question" on the agenda of the General Assembly and discussing the five-member committee's "report" slandering Hungary. He said that we are now stronger than before the October events last year. It can be said with certainty that those who want to slander the Soviet Union and Hungary are bound to fail.

Tsedenbal said in his speech that the Hungarian people, in cooperation with the socialist camp countries, have made great achievements in restoring the economy that was destroyed during the October events last year.

Tsedenbal said that some imperialist elements are not only against Hungary but also against Mongolia. They have been obstructing Mongolia from joining the United Nations. He then condemned the sabotage role played by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Security Council's obstruction of Mongolia's accession to the United Nations.

After visiting Hungary for four days, the Mongolian government delegation left Budapest for Prague on the morning of September 12.
