Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th. In Heilongjiang Province, industrial and mining enterprises have promptly improved their work during the mass airing of views by workers, greatly increasing the production enthusiasm of the workers.

    In the past ten days, sixty-one industrial and mining enterprises in Heilongjiang Province have launched rectification movements, with more than 80,000 workers putting forward more than 25,000 suggestions through big-character posters, group discussions, and other methods. These suggestions have been valued by enterprise leaders. The first batch of eleven units in Mudanjiang City to launch rectification movements has already resolved 594 problems.

    The masses of workers are very satisfied with the leaders' willingness to listen to opinions and earnestly solve problems. Workers in the No. 1 Pit of the Chengzihe Coal Mine in Jixi learned that twenty-three of the ninety-six suggestions they had put forward had been resolved, and their production enthusiasm was even higher, exceeding the daily production quota by ninety-nine tons of coal. The Songha Machinery Factory failed to complete its tasks in July and August, and there were also production shortfalls during flood prevention, so some leading cadres lacked confidence in completing the tasks. However, now that the factory has launched a mass airing of views, the labor efficiency of workers has greatly improved. Based on the current production situation, the factory will not only be able to complete its September tasks but also make up for the production shortfalls. The attendance rate of workers in many units is also higher than usual, and the phenomenon of lax labor discipline has changed. A democratic atmosphere and a tense atmosphere of production are pervading the enterprises.

    领导上改进工作迅速认真
    黑龙江职工生产热情大增
    据新华社哈尔滨28日电　黑龙江省工矿企业在职工大鸣大放中及时改进工作，大大地提高了职工生产热情。
    近十天来，黑龙江省已经有六十一个工矿企业单位展开整风运动，八万多职工通过大字报、小组座谈等方式，提出了二万五千多件意见。这些意见得到企业领导方面的重视。牡丹江市第一批开展整风运动的十一个单位，目前已经解决了五百九十四个问题。
    职工群众对领导上虚心倾听意见，认真解决问题，非常满意。鸡西煤矿城子河矿一坑工人知道他们所提出的九十六条意见，已经解决了二十三条，生产劲头更高，当日就超额生产了九十九吨煤。松哈机械厂七、八月份都没有完成任务，防汛时又有欠产，因此某些领导干部对完成任务缺乏信心。但是现在厂里开展大鸣大放以后，职工劳动效率大大提高，按现在生产情况看，这个厂不仅能完成9月份任务，还能补上欠产的数字。许多单位职工出勤率也比平常高，劳动纪律松弛的现象有了改变，在企业中洋溢着民主气氛和紧张的生产气氛。
