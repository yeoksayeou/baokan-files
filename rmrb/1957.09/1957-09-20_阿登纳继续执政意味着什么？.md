　　What Does Adenauer's Continued Rule Mean?
　　The result of the West German general election is that Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union has won a majority in parliament. Therefore, Adenauer will continue to govern.
　　What are the reasons that have enabled the Adenauer party to gain an advantage again in this election? The main reason is that democratic and progressive forces have been persecuted, and at the same time, the election was held under a fascist atmosphere. In the circumstances where the Communist Party was banned and the election system was undemocratic, the competition was actually conducted among the three major parties of the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democratic Party, and the Free Democratic Party, especially between the first two parties. The Adenauer party, with the strong support of West German major monopoly capital groups and the Catholic Church, as well as the Western countries headed by the United States, was in an obviously advantageous position in the election.
　　The issues that the German people are most concerned about at present are national reunification and peace. In its election propaganda, the Adenauer party has tried its best to incite national chauvinist sentiments, while portraying Adenauer as the standard-bearer of German reunification and the maintainer of national security. This election propaganda has received direct support from Western countries. Western countries have made the issue of disarmament dependent on Adenauer's policy of a "unified Germany," and recently specially issued a joint statement on the German question, giving the West German people the illusion that only by continuing to let Adenauer govern can German reunification be hoped for. The blatant interference of Western countries in the West German election and the support of monopoly capital and the church are important factors in the Adenauer party's gaining an electoral advantage.
　　In addition, the temporary prosperity of the West German economy has also been used by the ruling Christian Democratic Union as an important election capital. In the past seven or eight years, the West German government and monopoly capital groups have used the anti-Soviet frenzy and arms expansion craze of the Western occupying powers such as the United States, Britain, and France to carry out large-scale fixed capital renewal and expansion work, enabling production to recover and develop rapidly. At the same time, they have taken advantage of the turmoil and contradictions in the capitalist world market to drastically expand outward economically and carry out flourishing foreign trade. The sustained rise of the West German economy after the war is mainly based on this foundation. The economic prosperity generated on this basis has made some of the masses have certain illusions about the deceptive theory of so-called "people's capitalism" vigorously promoted by Adenauer, which has also helped the Adenauer party win votes.
　　In contrast to the Adenauer party's advantageous position and active campaign activities, the Social Democratic Party has adopted an ambiguous and wavering stance. The Social Democratic Party originally had a good opportunity to unite the forces of peace, democracy, and anti-Adenauer in West Germany to form a broad mass movement to change Adenauer's anti-peace, anti-national, and anti-democratic policies, help stop the threat of atomic war, restore German reunification on a peaceful and democratic basis, and improve relations between East and West. However, the right-wing leadership group of the Social Democratic Party, limited by anti-Soviet and anti-communist prejudices, both rejected the grand alliance against Adenauer and failed to put forward a clear-cut election program, and adopted a position that actually echoed Adenauer on important issues such as relations with the Soviet Union and understanding between the two parts of Germany, thus making the Social Democratic Party weak and powerless in the competition with the Adenauer party.
　　What does it mean that the Adenauer party has once again maintained its advantage in the West German election held every four years?
　　As everyone knows, since Adenauer came to power eight years ago, the West German monopoly capital groups and Junker landlord forces, who prepared and launched two world wars, have re-emerged. Today, they have regained their economic strength on the eve of World War II. The London and Paris agreements jointly planned by the Western occupying powers and the Adenauer government opened the door for West German rearmament. West Germany's participation in the aggressive military bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headed by the United States has embarked on the road of directly preparing for a new war. Feeling that they have grown fat again, the West German militarists are now even openly demanding the establishment of nuclear armaments. At the same time, with Adenauer's assistance, American imperialism is step by step turning West Germany into its atomic war base and shock troops in a new war.
　　The policy pursued by Adenauer has hindered the improvement of relations between East and West, exacerbated the tension in Europe, and is the main obstacle to the restoration of German reunification. Adenauer's continued rule will undoubtedly continue to promote this dangerous policy, which means further increasing the threat to peace and security in Europe, and at the same time means bringing greater disaster to the West German people.
　　It is precisely for this reason that Washington's strategic planners are rejoicing over the results of the West German election. When promoting its European plan, the United States now regards West Germany as its main pillar. Adenauer's close relationship with American monopoly capital and his record of pro-American policies have made Washington increasingly believe that Adenauer's Germany is a more reliable "partner" than Eden or Macmillan's Britain. Now Washington has placed great hopes on the results of the West German election. Senator Morse of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said without concealment: Adenauer's victory "strengthens the United States' hope of expanding its influence throughout Europe." The implication of this sentence is worthy of deep thought by the people of Germany and other European countries.
　　But it would be too naive to think that the most aggressive German monopoly capital groups and Junker landlord forces would be willing to act as Washington's grooms indefinitely. They have used the traditional Munich spirit of the Western imperialist powers after the war to try their best to strengthen their own forces. They are currently gradually but firmly continuing to increase their economic strength, seize economic positions in the capitalist world, try to control the economic hegemony of the European continent, and compete with capitalist powers with traditional spheres of influence in various regions of the capitalist world, especially squeezing out the forces of the weakened British and French imperialism. History has repeatedly proved that this kind of economic competition between imperialisms is the starting point of the road directly leading to wars for the redivision of spheres of influence. Any "friendly" and "peaceful" promises made by Adenauer will not change this law. When officials in London and Paris are also expressing "satisfaction" and "happiness" over Adenauer's victory, this is still a historically meaningful lesson for those who have "lifted a stone to drop it on their own feet."
　　As far as West Germany itself is concerned, although the Adenauer party has favorable conditions for the election and used all methods, it has failed to obtain the two-thirds majority it hoped for, while the Social Democratic Party, although its leadership was wavering and weak and its campaign activities were subject to various sabotage, still increased by 1.5 million votes compared with the last election, occupying just over one-third of the seats in the Federal Parliament. This shows that in West Germany, the forces opposing Adenauer's revanchist and war policies have a broad mass base, and it will not be smooth sailing for Adenauer to continue to pursue his policies of deepening the division of Germany and preparing for a new war. With the improvement of the West German people's awareness and the development of the inevitable crisis of the capitalist economy, the forces in West Germany advocating peace, national reunification, and international friendship will further increase.

### 阿登纳继续执政意味着什么？

　　阿登纳继续执政意味着什么？
    西德进行大选的结果，阿登纳的基督教民主联盟取得了议会的多数。因此，阿登纳将继续执政。
    是什么原因使得阿登纳党在这次大选中再次取得优势呢？主要的原因是因为民主进步力量受到迫害，同时，选举是在法西斯气氛的笼罩下举行的。在共产党遭到禁止、选举制度不民主的情形下，竞选实际上只是在基督教民主联盟、社会民主党和自由民主党三大党之间，特别是在前两党之间进行。阿登纳党由于得到西德主要垄断资本集团和天主教教会以及以美国为首的西方国家的大力支持，在竞选中处于显然有利的地位。
    德国人民目前最关心的问题就是国家统一和和平的问题。阿登纳党在竞选宣传中，竭力煽动民族沙文主义的情绪，同时把阿登纳描绘成为德国统一的旗手和国家安全的维护者。这种竞选宣传得到西方国家的直接支持。西方国家把裁军问题取决于阿登纳的“统一德国”的政策，并且在不久前特地发表了一个关于德国问题的联合声明，给西德人民一个幻觉，似乎只有继续让阿登纳执政，德国的统一才有希望。西方国家对西德选举的露骨干涉和垄断资本以及教会的支持，是阿登纳党取得选举优势的重要因素。
    此外，西德经济暂时的繁荣景象，也被执政的基督教民主联盟利用作为一项重要的竞选资本。在过去七八年间，西德政府和垄断资本集团利用美、英、法等西方占领国家政府的反苏狂和扩军热，进行了巨大规模的固定资本更新和扩充的工作，使生产获得了较快的恢复和发展，同时又利用资本主义世界市场上的动乱和矛盾，急剧地向外进行经济扩张，开展了兴盛的对外贸易。西德战后经济的持续上升，主要就是建立在这个基础上的。在这种基础上产生的经济繁荣，使一部分群众对阿登纳所大肆宣传的所谓“人民资本主义”的骗人理论产生了某些幻想，这也有助于阿登纳党取得选票。
    同阿登纳党的有利地位和积极的竞选活动相对照，社会民主党却采取了暧昧和动摇的立场。社会民主党本来有良好的机会，联合西德和平、民主和反阿登纳的力量，形成一个广泛的群众运动，来改变阿登纳的反和平、反民族、反民主的政策，有助于制止原子战争的威胁，在和平民主基础上恢复德国的统一以及改善东西方之间的关系。但是社会民主党的右翼领导集团囿于反苏、反共的成见，既排斥反阿登纳的大联合，又提不出旗帜鲜明的竞选纲领，而且在对苏联的关系和德国东西两部分之间的谅解这些重要问题上，采取了实际上为阿登纳唱和的立场，因而使社会民主党在同阿登纳党竞选中处于软弱无力的地位。
    阿登纳党在西德四年一次的大选中再一次保持优势，意味着什么呢？
    大家知道，阿登纳执政八年以来，西德垄断资本集团和容克地主势力已经重新抬头，正是这些势力，准备和发动了两次世界大战。今天，他们已经恢复了他们在第二次大战前夕的经济实力。西方占领国家同阿登纳政府共同策划的伦敦和巴黎协定，为西德的重新武装敞开了大门。西德参加以美国为首的侵略性军事集团北大西洋公约，更是走上了直接准备新战争的道路。感到自己又羽毛丰满起来了的西德军国主义分子，现在甚至公开要求建立核军备。同时，在阿登纳的协助下，美帝国主义一步步地把西德变为它的原子战争基地和新战争中的突击队。
    阿登纳奉行的这种政策，阻碍了东西方关系的改善，加剧了欧洲的紧张局势，并且是德国恢复统一的主要障碍。阿登纳的继续执政，无疑必将继续推行这种危险政策，这意味着将进一步增加对于欧洲和平和安全的威胁，同时意味着将给西德人民带来更大的灾难。
    正因为如此，华盛顿的战略策划人对西德大选结果表示兴高采烈决不是偶然的。美国在推行它的欧洲计划时，现在已把西德作为它的主要支柱。阿登纳同美国垄断资本的密切关系以及他的亲美政策的记录，使华盛顿愈来愈相信，阿登纳的德国是比艾登或麦克米伦的英国更可依恃的“伙伴”。现在华盛顿已对西德大选结果寄予极大希望，美国参议院外交委员会委员莫尔斯毫不掩饰地说：阿登纳的胜利“加强了美国扩大在整个欧洲的影响的希望”。这句话的含意，是值得德国和其他欧洲国家人民深思的。
    但是如果以为最富侵略性的德国垄断资本集团和容克地主势力，会无限期地甘愿充当华盛顿的马夫，那也是过分天真的想法。他们在战后利用西方帝国主义大国传统的慕尼黑精神，竭力壮大自己的力量。他们目前正在逐步地但是坚定地继续增强经济实力，攫夺资本主义世界的经济阵地，设法掌握欧洲大陆的经济霸权，并在资本主义世界各个地区同拥有传统势力范围的资本主义大国争雄长，特别是排挤已经削弱了的英、法帝国主义的势力。历史已经多次证明，帝国主义之间的这种经济竞争是直接通向重分势力范围的战争的道路的起点。阿登纳作出的任何“友好”、“和平”的诺言，都不会改变这条规律。当伦敦和巴黎的官方人士也在因阿登纳的胜利而表示“满意”和“高兴”的时候，对于曾经“搬起石头打自己的脚”的人们，这仍然是一条有现实意义的历史教训。
    就西德本身说来，阿登纳党虽然拥有竞选的有利条件，并使用了一切方法，但是并未能得到它所希望的三分之二多数，而社会民主党虽然由于领导的动摇软弱，并且它的竞选活动受到种种破坏，仍然比上次大选增加了一百五十万张选票，在联邦议院中占到刚刚超过三分之一的议席。这说明，在西德，反对阿登纳的复仇主义和战争政策的力量，有广泛的群众基础，阿登纳要继续推行其加深德国分裂和准备新战争的政策，不会是顺利无阻的。随着西德人民觉悟的提高和资本主义经济不可避免的危机的发展，西德主张和平、国家统一和国际友好的力量，将会进一步增长。
