    Squeezing Out Yellow Novels
    Wen Cao
    In the No. 4 Work Area of the Beijing Second Construction Company, there is a club where seven or eight hundred people read books and newspapers and participate in other cultural and recreational activities every day. However, some workers are unwilling to go to the club and instead lie in bed reading yellow novels after work. Some workers are deeply influenced by yellow novels, becoming obsessed and mentally drained. Zhang Jingchang, a young worker, after reading "Behind Yinshan," which promoted eating, drinking, and having fun, wrote a note saying "Live for today, for tomorrow we may die" and posted it on his bedside as a motto.
    The club had held meetings with these comrades, explaining the harm of reading yellow novels. But it had no effect. They said, "Reading the books in your club is not satisfying, not exciting."
    Sun Baoheng, the head of the club's library group, had spoken to Hua Rongzhi, a fan of yellow novels, several times, asking him to borrow new books from the library. Each time, Hua Rongzhi agreed in person, but in reality, he still had his nose stuck in yellow novels. Once, Sun Baoheng asked an activist in the library who lived with Hua Rongzhi to put a copy of "Legend of the White Snake" by Hua Rongzhi's bed. After Hua Rongzhi finished reading the yellow novel, he casually picked up "Legend of the White Snake" and flipped through it. He thought it was pretty good and read it all in one go. A few days later, Sun Baoheng asked someone to put a copy of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" on Hua Rongzhi's bedside, and Hua Rongzhi started reading it again. Just as Hua Rongzhi was reading with great interest, the activist suddenly came to ask for the book back. Hua Rongzhi said many good things, asking to let him finish reading, and asked where these books came from. The activist took the opportunity to say to him, "Our library has many books about heroes and model deeds, which are even more interesting than 'Legend of the White Snake'." He told him in detail what books the library had and how to borrow books. From then on, Hua Rongzhi often borrowed books from the club and stopped reading yellow novels.
    The worker Xu Kegang, like Hua Rongzhi, loved to read yellow novels. Tie Enxiang, the director of the club, Sun Baoheng, the head of the library group, and other comrades had all tried to persuade him, even hiding his yellow novels in a joking way. But they still couldn't change his hobby. One Sunday morning, Tie Enxiang heard that Xu Kegang was going into the city and asked him to buy books at the Xinhua Bookstore, hoping to arouse his interest in beneficial novels. The first time was unsuccessful, and Xu Kegang said that he couldn't find any books he liked. The second time he went into the city, Tie Enxiang asked him to go again and told him to look at "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Heroes and Daughters," and other books. If he thought they were good, he should buy them back for the library. Xu Kegang had never read these books before and didn't know what they were about. This time, he flipped through them in the bookstore and thought they were even more interesting than yellow novels. So, he stopped reading yellow novels from then on.
    The club library in this work area uses proactive introductions and gradual guidance based on each person's preferences to change the workers' habit of reading yellow novels. All the people who used to love reading yellow novels are now enthusiastic promoters of the library, telling people everywhere, "Our library is so good! It has everything you want to read, those books are really great, and you feel full of energy after reading them."

    挤掉了黄色小说
    文操
    北京市第二工程公司四工区有个俱乐部，每天都有七、八百人在那里看书看报和进行其它文化娱乐活动。但是，有些工人却不愿意到俱乐部去，一下班就躺在床上看黄色小说。有的工人受黄色小说影响极深，神魂颠倒，精神萎靡不振。青年工人张景敞，看了宣传吃喝玩乐的“阴山背后”以后，写了一张“今朝有酒今朝醉”的纸条，贴在床头上当作座右铭。
    俱乐部曾经找这些同志开会，向他们讲看黄色小说的害处。但是，一点效果也没有。他们说：“看你们俱乐部那些书不过瘾，不起劲儿。”
    俱乐部图书室组长孙宝恒，曾经对黄色小说迷华荣芝讲过几次，请他到图书馆去借阅新书。每一次，华荣芝当面都答应了，实际上还是手不释卷地看黄色小说。有一次，孙宝恒叫跟华荣芝住在一起的图书室积极分子把一本“白蛇传”放在华荣芝的床边。华荣芝看完了黄色小说，顺手抓起“白蛇传”翻了翻。他觉得还不错，一气就看完了。过了几天，孙宝恒又托人把一本“聊斋志异”放在华荣芝的床头上，华荣芝又看起来。华荣芝正看得津津有味的时候，这个积极分子突然去要书。华荣芝说了很多好话，要求让他看完，还问这些书从哪儿借来的。这位积极分子便趁机对他说：“咱们图书室里有很多写英雄、模范事迹的书，比‘白蛇传’还有意思呢。”他把图书室都有哪些书详细地告诉了他，还告诉他借书的方法。从此，华荣芝就经常在俱乐部借书看，再也不看黄色小说了。
    工人许克刚跟华荣芝一样爱看黄色小说。俱乐部主任铁恩祥、图书室组长孙宝恒等同志都劝过他，甚至用开玩笑的方式把他的黄色小说藏起来。可是还改变不了他的爱好。一个星期天早晨，铁恩祥听说许克刚要进城，就托他到新华书店买书，想引起他对有益的小说的兴趣。第一次没有成功，许克刚说他爱看的书一本也没有找到。他第二次进城的时候，铁恩祥又叫他去，并且叮嘱他看看三国演义、新儿女英雄传等书，如果觉得好，就代图书馆买回来。许克刚以前没有看过这些书，不知道它们讲的是什么，这一回在书店里翻一翻，觉得比黄色小说还有意思，于是，他从此就不看黄色小说了。
    这个工区的俱乐部图书室就是根据每个人的爱好，用主动介绍、逐步诱导的办法，改变工人们看黄色小说的爱好。所有以前爱看黄色小说的人，现在都成了图书室的热心的宣传员，他们到处跟人说：“我们的图书室多好呀！想看什么有什么，那些书真够味，看了浑身是劲。”
