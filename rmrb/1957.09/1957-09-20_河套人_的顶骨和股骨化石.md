　　Fossilized Cranial and Femoral Bones of "Hetao Man"

　　Fossilized cranial and femoral bones of "Hetao Man," dating back approximately 70,000 to 100,000 years, have been discovered in Dishao Gouwan Village, Sala Wusu River, Wushen Banner, Yikezhao League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

　　The cranial bone fossil was found on a terrace in a river valley, 35.5 meters above the ground and 12.5 meters above the water surface. According to experts from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this cranial bone has four angles, with an average thickness of 6.85 millimeters, thicker than the average thickness of modern human cranial bones (5.2 millimeters), but thinner than the average thickness of "Peking Man" skulls. Traces of arterial branching remain in the inner layer of this cranial bone fossil, mainly manifested in the middle of the front part. Arterial branching in ape-men is mainly in the middle part, while in modern humans it is mainly in the front. All these fully demonstrate that "Hetao Man" is between ape-men and modern humans, but closer to modern humans.

　　The femur (thigh bone) fossil is the lower half of a left femur, located only over 100 meters away from the cranial bone's excavation site, 30.65 meters above the ground and 17.35 meters above the water surface, in hard soil. The existing length of this femur is 22.5 centimeters, and the average thickness of the bone wall reaches 7.25 millimeters, thicker than the average femur of modern humans, but thinner than that of ape-men.

　　Near the excavation site of the bone fossils, an Old Stone Age site was also discovered, yielding a total of 64 Old Stone Age tools and stone chips.

　　In the past, the culture of the early stage of the Old Stone Age in our country was represented by Peking Man in Zhoukoudian, and the late stage was represented by "Upper Cave Man." After liberation, the discovery of "Ziyang Man" skull fossils in Ziyang County, Sichuan Province, and "Dingcun Man" tooth fossils in Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province, further enriched the research materials on the Old Stone Age culture. The discovery of "Hetao Man" bone fossils this time provides new and valuable data for further research on the history, culture, and human structure of "Hetao Man" in the Middle Old Stone Age.

### “河套人”的顶骨和股骨化石

　　“河套人”的顶骨和股骨化石
    埋藏地下约七万年到十万年的“河套人”顶骨和股骨化石，已在内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟乌审旗萨拉乌苏河滴哨沟湾村发现。
    顶骨化石是在河谷里的一处阶地上发现的，上距地面三十五点五公尺，下距水面十二点五公尺。据中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室专家鉴定，这块顶骨有四个角，每个角的平均厚度达六点八五公厘，比现代人顶骨厚度的平均数五点二公厘厚，比“中国猿人”头骨的平均厚度薄。在这块顶骨化石的里层，还遗留着动脉分枝的痕迹，着重表现在前半部的中间。猿人的动脉分枝着重在中部，现代人又着重在前方。这些都充分表明“河套人”处在猿人与现代人之间，而更接近于现代人。
    股骨（即大腿骨）化石是左股骨的下半部，它与顶骨出土地点只相隔一百多公尺，上距地面三十点六五公尺，下距水面十七点三五公尺，地层土质坚硬。这块股骨现存的长度是二十二点五公分，骨壁厚度平均达七点二五公厘，比现代人的一般股骨厚，比猿人股骨薄。
    在骨化石出土地点的附近，还发现了旧石器时代遗址一处，得到旧石器和石屑共六十四件。
    过去研究我国旧石器时代初期的文化是以北京周口店猿人为代表，晚期是以“山顶洞人”为代表。解放后先后在四川省资阳县发现“资阳人”头骨化石，在山西省襄汾县发现“丁村人”牙化石，又充实了旧石器时代文化研究的资料。这次“河套人”骨化石的发现，对进一步研究旧石器时代中期“河套人”的历史、文化及人体构造，提供了新的珍贵资料。
