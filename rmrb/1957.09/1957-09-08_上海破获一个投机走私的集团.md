Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 7th. The public security departments of Shanghai and Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, have cracked down on a criminal ring that was illegally transporting state-purchased and marketed goods for speculation and smuggling. The key members of this ring, criminals Shi Ligao, Huang Yanchang, Yang Piji, Wu Guoliang, and others, were all arrested according to the law on August 31.

The smuggling ring had nearly thirty members. Their activities extended from Shanghai to four districts and more than ten townships in Chongming County. After the state opened up the free market, they took the opportunity to engage in speculation and profiteering in the market. Since the beginning of this year, they have been more organized and planned in smuggling large quantities of state-purchased and marketed goods from Chongming County to Shanghai for sale on the black market. According to statistics from June and July alone, this ring smuggled more than 1,000 dozen knitted gloves, over 2,000 catties of grain, over 2,000 feet of native cloth, hundreds of catties of cooking oil, and large quantities of peanuts, soybeans, and copper materials that the local government had prohibited private individuals from taking out of the county. They also bought over 10,000 feet of cotton cloth coupons from Chongming farmers at low prices and resold them to cotton cloth vendors in Shanghai. They also colluded with some smugglers in Shanghai to sell smuggled goods.

In Chongming, this smuggling ring used methods such as impersonating cadres from supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, forging letters of introduction, and raising prices to acquire state-purchased and marketed goods. Their methods of speculation in Shanghai were also very secretive. After obtaining huge profits, these criminals secretly gathered for gambling, with each game involving thousands of yuan.

Most of the key members of this ring had previously been sentenced to prison for crimes. Shi Ligao, Yang Piji, Wu Guoliang, and others had been sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to five years after liberation for robbery and smuggling activities.

    上海破获一个投机走私的集团
    新华社上海7日电　上海市和江苏省崇明县的公安部门破获了一个大量偷运国家统购统销物资进行投机走私的犯罪集团。这个集团的骨干分子施利高、黄彦昌、杨丕基、吴国良等罪犯，已在8月31日全部被依法逮捕。
    这个走私集团的成员近三十人。他们的活动范围一边是上海，一边扩展到崇明县四个区和十多个乡镇。国家开放自由市场后，他们乘机在市场上投机倒把。今年以来，更有组织、有计划地从崇明县偷运大量国家统购统销的物资到上海，在黑市上贩售。仅据6、7两个月的统计，这个集团就偷运了当地政府禁止私人出埠的线织手套一千多打，粮食二千多斤，土布二千多尺，食油数百斤，以及大批花生、黄豆和铜料等。他们还以低价向崇明农民收买了一万多尺棉布购布券，来上海转卖给棉布摊贩。他们还和上海的一些走私犯勾结，贩卖走私物品。
    这个走私集团在崇明用冒充供销社和农业社干部、伪造证明信以及抬高价格等办法，收购统购统销物资。他们在上海进行投机活动的方法也很诡秘。在获取暴利后，这伙犯罪分子便暗地聚赌，每次输赢在千元以上。
    这个集团的骨干分子大多曾因犯罪被判过徒刑。施利高、杨丕基、吴国良等，在解放后曾因抢劫、走私活动分别被判刑一年到五年。
