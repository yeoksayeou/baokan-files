Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 22nd: The "Blitz" newspaper reports that personnel from the American Embassy in New Delhi are abusing diplomatic privileges to smuggle gems, damage Indian monuments, and steal property.

According to the newspaper's September 14th issue, an individual named Bohlen from the American Embassy recently made a secret "official" visit to Agra. He contacted several officials in the archaeological department and, through them, arranged a secret meeting with some of the keepers of the famous Taj Mahal. During the meeting, Bohlen revealed a conspiracy: to steal the gems inlaid in the marble carvings, loot the building, and massively deface the monuments of this ancient city of Agra. Bohlen promised to pay his accomplices a large sum of money as a reward.

Although Bohlen's conspiracy primarily targeted the Taj Mahal, the initial implementation of the plot was directed at an old palace in Agra Fort. In one night, thieves bought off by the Americans stole hundreds of gems. It was later discovered that other monuments had suffered the same fate.

However, the strict vigilance and timely action of the authorities saved the Taj Mahal from being looted.

Investigations into the criminal activities of foreign agents have shown that they regularly purchase stolen antique gems in the region and transport them out of India.

    美国外交官做贼
    破坏印度古迹盗窃宝物
    据新华社新德里22日电　“闪电”周报报道，美国驻新德里大使馆人员滥用外交便利偷运宝石，破坏印度古迹和财产。
    据这家周报9月14日出版的一期说，美国大使馆有个叫博临的人最近“因公”秘密访问了亚格拉。他同考古部门的几个职员进行了接触，通过他们安排了一次同有名的泰吉·玛哈尔陵的一些看守人员举行的秘密会议。在会议中，博临透露了一个阴谋：要偷走镶嵌在大理石雕刻品中的宝石，劫掠建筑物和大规模地损污这座亚格拉古城的古迹。博临答应给他的同谋者以大量金钱作为报酬。
    虽然博临的阴谋是以泰吉·玛哈尔陵作为主要目标，可是这个阴谋最初的实施对象是亚格拉堡的一所古老的宫殿，在一夜之间，美国收买的贼就偷走了数百颗宝石。后来发现，其他一些古迹也遭受了同样的命运。
    然而，当局的严密警戒和及时的行动使泰吉·玛哈尔陵免于遭受劫掠。
    对外国代理人犯罪活动的调查表明，他们定期地在这个地区收买盗窃得来的古迹宝石，并把它们运出印度。
