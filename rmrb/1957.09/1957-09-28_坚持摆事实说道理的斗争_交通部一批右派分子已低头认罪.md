    This newspaper reports that since the Ministry of Communications held a general staff and workers' rally in July to counterattack rightists, and conducted face-to-face struggles with the rightist ringleader Zhang Bojun and the backbone elements of his anti-communist group in the Ministry of Communications, systematically exposing their ugly faces, it immediately turned to various units adopting small and medium-sized debate meetings. This gradually led the anti-rightist struggle to a process of presenting facts and reasoning, launching mass debates with the rightists. After more than two months of debate and exposure, the rightists have been completely isolated among the masses. Many rightists, in the face of the masses' righteous and stern reasoning, were left speechless and confessed their crimes, and initially confessed their anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.
    Yang Yitang (member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, deputy director of the General Office of the Ministry of Communications), a backbone member of the Zhang Bojun anti-communist group, actively participated in the six "ignition meetings" organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party during the rectification campaign. He arranged for his henchmen to organize ignition meetings of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party in various units of the Ministry of Communications. He fabricated the fallacy of the so-called "two lines," saying that "administration is a dotted line, and the Party group is a solid line." Therefore, he attributed Zhang Bojun's lack of active work in the Ministry of Communications to "improper arrangements" by the leadership, and said "this is of course a problem of the system." In order to faithfully implement Zhang Bojun's policy of broad recruitment, he went to Shandong to recruit troops and buy horses. After being exposed and refuted by the masses, Yang Yitang has begun to confess some problems, but his attitude is still very dishonest, and he attempts to stubbornly resist on many important issues.
    The rightist Liu Yongli (member of the Civil Revolutionary Committee's branch in the Ministry of Communications, teacher at the Beijing Cadre School of the Ministry of Communications) spread rumors, saying that the socialist system in China has been "experimented" with for seven or eight years, and has "proven" that everything has been done "badly," and that it cannot continue, and must be "changed." Now, the staff and workers of the Ministry of Communications Cadre School are systematically refuting this rightist who hates socialism.
    The rightist Zhao Qi (reporter for People's Navigation Newspaper) slandered our country's newspapers at a forum for Beijing journalists, saying that they are three types of "ownership" -- namely: organ ownership (Party newspapers), group ownership (newspapers of trade unions and the Communist Youth League), and people's ownership (the so-called "compatriot" newspapers). He also tried his best to praise the "compatriot" newspapers with "people's ownership," saying that they "cannot be restrained by leading organs." He also peddled Wang Zhong's bourgeois journalism views, promoting the "commodity nature and interest" of newspapers, and attempting to tamper with the socialist direction of the People's Navigation Newspaper. After being criticized by the masses, he lowered his head and confessed his crimes, and made a preliminary confession.
    Another group of rightists exposed by the Ministry of Communications, such as Sun Jiuyang (member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, deputy chief engineer of the Navigation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications), Pan Weiyao (alternate member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, section chief of the Highway General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications), Yang Mingrui (technician of the Water Transport Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications), Guan Tongxian (technician of the Haihe Transport Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, member of the Communist Youth League), etc., also began to lower their heads and confess their crimes after being exposed and refuted by the masses.
    In order to refute the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists, further enhance the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses, and distinguish between right and wrong, the Ministry of Communications held a debate from September 12th to 20th, and launched a reasoning struggle against Qiu Kehui (alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, deputy director of the People's Communications Publishing House), Zhang Bojun's cultural strategist. More than 3,000 cadres from all departments in Beijing participated in listening.
    Over the past week, more than 40 people (most of whom are engineering technicians, members of democratic parties, and non-party personnel) have engaged in a "fierce battle" with the rightist Qiu Kehui, which has enabled everyone to distinguish between right and wrong. At the same time, some rightists who originally wanted to adhere to their anti-communist stance also expressed their desire to lower their heads and confess their crimes. For example, Dong Mingqi, a rightist from the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, expressed his desire to lower his head and confess his crimes to the leadership and the masses during the debate conference, and to thoroughly confess his crimes. The masses unanimously believe that this debate was completely based on presenting facts and reasoning. This conference has strongly encouraged everyone's confidence in the anti-rightist struggle, and will surely promote the further deepening of the anti-rightist struggle in the Ministry of Communications in the future.

    坚持摆事实说道理的斗争
    交通部一批右派分子已低头认罪
    本报讯　交通部自7月间召开全体职工反击右派分子大会，同右派头子章伯钧及其反共集团中在交通部的骨干分子，进行了面对面的斗争，系统地揭露了他们的丑恶面貌后，紧接着转入各单位采取中小型辩论会的形式，把反右斗争逐步引向摆事实，讲道理的说理斗争，同右派分子展开了群众性的大辩论。经过两个多月的论战和揭发，右派分子在群众中已完全陷于孤立。许多右派分子在群众义正词严的说理斗争面前，理屈词穷，低头认罪，并初步交代了反共反社会主义的言行。
    章伯钧反共集团中的骨干分子杨逸棠（农工民主党中央执行局委员、交通部办公厅副主任），整风期间，曾积极参与农工民主党北京市委组织的六种点火会，布置他的爪牙，组织交通部各单位内农工民主党召开的点火会。他捏造所谓“两条线”的谬论，说“行政是虚线，党组是实线”。因此，他把章伯钧之所以不积极到交通部工作，说成是领导上“安排不当”，并且说“这当然是制度问题”。他为了忠实执行章伯钧的大撒网方针，到山东去招兵买马。经过群众的揭发与驳斥，杨逸棠虽已开始交代了若干问题，但其态度仍很不老实，在很多重要问题上妄图顽抗。
    右派分子刘永立（民革交通部支部委员，交通部北京干部学校教员）造谣说，社会主义制度在中国“试验”了七八年，已“证明”处处都搞“糟”了，并认为已经不能继续下去，非“改弦更张”不可。现在交通干校职工们正在对这个仇恨社会主义的右派分子进行有系统的驳斥。
    右派分子赵琪（人民航运报记者）在北京新闻工作者座谈会上，诬蔑我们国家的报纸，是三种“所有制”——即：机关所有制（党报）、团体所有制（工会、青年团的报纸）、人民群众所有制（即所谓“同仁”报纸）。并且竭力赞扬“人民群众所有制”的“同仁”报纸“可以不受领导机关约束”。他还贩卖了王中的资产阶级新闻学观点，宣扬报纸的“商品性、趣味性”，妄图篡改人民航运报的社会主义方向。经过群众的批判，他已低头认罪，并作了初步交代。
    交通部揭发出来的另一批右派分子，如孙九阳（民盟北京市委委员，交通部航务工程局副总工程师）、潘维耀（农工民主党北京市委候补委员、交通部公路总局科长）、杨铭瑞（交通部水运设计院技术员）、管彤贤（交通部海河运输局技术员、共青团员）等，在群众的揭发、驳斥后，也开始低头认罪。
    为了驳斥右派的反动言行，进一步提高广大群众的政治思想觉悟，明辨大是大非，交通部于9月12日至20日，召开了辩论会，向右派头子章伯钧的文化策士丘克辉（民盟候补中委、人民交通出版社副社长）展开了说理斗争。在京机关全体干部三千多人都参加了收听。
    这一周来，经过四十多人（其中大多数是工程技术人员、民主党派成员、无党派的工作人员）向右派分子丘克辉展开一场“激战”，使大家明辨了大是大非。同时，一些原来想坚持反共立场的右派分子，也表示要低头认罪，如交通部教育局的右派分子董鸣岐，就在辩论大会期间，向领导上和群众表示低头认罪，要彻底交代。群众一致认为这次辩论会上完全是摆事实、讲道理。这次大会对于大家的反右斗争的信心作了有力的鼓舞。一定会促使交通部今后的反右斗争更加深入一步。
