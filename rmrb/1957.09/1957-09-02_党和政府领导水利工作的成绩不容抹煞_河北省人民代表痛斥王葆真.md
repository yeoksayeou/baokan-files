Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 1st: A great debate unfolded at the Sixth Session of the First Hebei Provincial People's Congress regarding the correctness of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and government's leadership in water conservancy work. At the meeting, Wang Baozhen's malicious attacks on the Party and government in this regard were thoroughly refuted.

Wang Baozhen is a member of the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Standing Committee Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and a representative to the National People's Congress. During the National CPPCC session in March and the plenary session of the Hebei Provincial CPPCC Committee in May this year, as well as in many other places, he launched vicious attacks on the Party and government leadership of Hebei Province under the guise of water conservancy issues. He fundamentally denied the achievements of water conservancy construction in Hebei Province over the past few years, saying that "water conservancy funds are equal to a waste," that "floods are becoming more and more serious year after year," and that "not even a glimmer of hope has yet been released." He distorted the truth about water management in Hebei Province, and then attacked it, saying that the Party and the People's Government's water conservancy work was characterized by "poor planning," "not hitting the nail on the head," and "some winding, trivial, and ineffective water management methods," and slandered the Party and government for "sitting idly by and watching the severe floods year after year, with millions of people suffering from wind and rain, cold and hunger, and epidemics." In order to attack the Party and government leadership, he even insisted that the irresistible flood of 1956 was the result of insufficient human effort. His absurd remarks have been widely spread throughout the country and in various parts of Hebei Province. His remarks stirred up a countercurrent on the issue of water conservancy. Chen Dian (Deputy Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC), a rightist element closely related to him, seized on this issue to stir up trouble and make a big fuss, first attacking the province's water conservancy work as "fruitless, with the masses complaining, and people from all walks of life criticizing it," saying that Hebei Province's water management had no positive measures. Later, he attacked the draft of the Hai River plan formulated by the central government as "far from adequate, leaving the people submerged in the turbulent waves waiting fifteen years to emerge from the abyss and ascend to a seat," and carried out vicious agitation, colluding with people at the provincial CPPCC meeting to sign his written speeches, trying to organize some people to launch a crusade against the government. Unlawful landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries in rural areas applauded Wang Baozhen's speech and seized on his speech as a weapon against the Communist Party and the government. This has created a very unfavorable impact on the Party and government's leadership in water conservancy construction.

At this provincial People's Congress, representatives exposed and criticized Wang Baozhen for distorting the truth about water management in Hebei. At the National CPPCC meeting in March, Wang Baozhen distorted and divided Hebei's complete water management plan, fabricating Hebei's "seven theories" of water management and then attacking them. The representatives pointed out that Wang Baozhen, as a member of the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, should know that since 1952, Hebei Province has shifted from focusing on repairing river channels and embankments during the recovery period (which was absolutely necessary at that time) to comprehensive management, combining large and medium-sized fundamental projects organized by the state, and extensively launching mass-based mountain soil and water conservation and plain flood prevention projects, and began to prepare a comprehensive management plan for the Hai River basin in 1954. It was more clearly proposed to implement the principle of giving equal importance to flood prevention, waterlogging prevention, and drought prevention, adopting the methods of unified planning, comprehensive management, adapting to local conditions, combining storage and discharge, fully mobilizing the masses, combining key national projects, extensively carrying out mass-based small-scale water conservancy, fully utilizing water resources, and gradually changing the appearance of mountainous, plain, and low-lying areas. In recent years, Hebei Province has achieved great results in water conservancy construction in accordance with this policy. Wang Baozhen's insistence that last year's irresistible natural disaster was due to insufficient human effort and placing the responsibility on the Party and government leaders of Hebei Province is clearly motivated by ulterior motives.

While affirming the great achievements, the representatives also examined the shortcomings in Hebei Province's water conservancy work and discussed the draft of the Hebei Province's Second Five-Year Water Conservancy Construction Plan proposed by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee at this meeting. The representatives were very excited about this magnificent water conservancy plan.

At the National CPPCC meeting, while distorting the facts and belittling Hebei's water management measures as "seven theories," Wang Baozhen put forward his "seven suggestions," saying that his seven suggestions had been submitted to the Hebei Provincial People's Congress in October 1956, "but it is not yet known whether they have been adopted." The representatives compared his seven suggestions with Hebei Province's water management measures and found that his so-called "seven suggestions," apart from the "ditch and pond system" he had proposed in the past, were all things that Hebei Province had already implemented or was implementing. He embellished his ditch and pond system with "seven suggestions," and then boasted about it, portraying himself as a water conservancy innovator.

### 党和政府领导水利工作的成绩不容抹煞  河北省人民代表痛斥王葆真

    党和政府领导水利工作的成绩不容抹煞
    河北省人民代表痛斥王葆真
    据新华社保定1日电  在河北省第一届人民代表大会第六次会议上就河北省党和政府对水利工作的领导是否正确问题，展开了大辩论。会上彻底驳斥了王葆真在这方面对党和政府的恶毒攻击。
    王葆真是河北省人民委员会委员，政协河北省委员会副主席，全国人民政协常委，全国人民代表大会代表。他在今年3月的全国政治协商会议和5月间召开的政协河北省委员会全体会议上，以及在很多地方，借水利问题对河北省的党政领导机关发动了恶毒攻击。他根本否定河北省几年来水利建设的成绩，说什么“水利经费等于虚掷”， “水灾年复一年的严重”，“尚未放出一线曙光”。他歪曲河北省治水真象，而后加以攻击，说党和人民政府在水利工作上“计划不善”，“没有切中要害”，“是一些弯弯曲曲的、枝枝节节的没有切实效果的一些治水办法”，并污蔑党和政府“坐看年复一年的严重水患，房倒屋塌数百万人民沐风沦雨，忍冻受饥，时疫流行”。他为了攻击党政领导机关，竟把1956年不可抗拒的水灾硬说成是人力未尽的结果。他的荒谬言论，曾在全国和河北省各地广为散布。他的言论在水利问题上掀起了一股逆流。同他有密切关系的右派分子陈迪庵（政协河北省委员会副秘书长），抓住这个问题大肆煽动，大作文章，先攻击省的水利工作是“劳而无功，群众怨声载道，各界人士群起指责”，说河北省治水没有积极措施。后来又攻击中央制订的海河规划草案是“远不济急，使人民沉没于波涛急流中等待十五年后出深渊而登诸衽席”，并进行恶毒的煽动，在省政协会上串连在他写好的发言稿上签名，想组织一些人向政府大兴问罪之师。农村的不法地主、富农分子和反革命分子，对王葆真的发言拍手称快，并抓住他的发言作武器反对共产党和政府。这样就给党政领导水利建设造成了极不利的影响。
    在这次全省人民代表大会上，代表们对王葆真歪曲河北治水真象，进行了揭发批判。王葆真在3月全国政协会议上，把河北完整的治水规划加以歪曲割裂，杜撰出河北治水“七说”而后加以攻击。代表们指出，王葆真身为河北省人民委员会委员，应当知道河北省自1952年即由恢复时期的着重修整河道堤防（那时是完全必要的）转向了综合治理，结合国家举办的大、中型根本性工程，广泛地展开了群众性的山区水土保持和平原防涝工程，并且从1954年开始着手编制海河流域的全面治理规划。更明确地提出贯彻执行防洪、防涝、防旱并重兼顾的方针，采取统一规划，综合治理，因地制宜，蓄泄兼施的方法，全面发动群众，结合国家重点工程，广泛开展群众性小型水利，充分利用水利资源，逐步改变山区、平原和低洼地区的面貌。几年内，河北省按照这个方针，在水利建设上已经取得了巨大的成绩。王葆真把去年不可抗拒的天灾硬说成人力未尽，把责任强加到河北省党、政领导头上，很显然这是别有用心的。
    在肯定了巨大成绩的同时，代表们也检查了河北省水利工作中的缺点，并讨论了中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会在这次会议上提出的河北省第二个五年水利建设规划草案。代表们对这一规模宏伟的水利规划感到十分兴奋。
    王葆真在全国政协会议上，在歪曲事实贬低河北治水措施斥为 “七说”的同时，提出了他的“七项建议”，说他这七项建议曾在1956年10月向河北省人代大会提出，“尚不知是否采纳”。代表们把他这七项建议和河北省治水措施比较了一下，发现他的所谓“七项建议”除去他过去提出的“沟池制”外，都是河北省早已实行或正在实行的东西。他把他的沟池制用“七项建议”装璜起来，就大肆吹嘘，把自己描画成为一个水利革新者。
