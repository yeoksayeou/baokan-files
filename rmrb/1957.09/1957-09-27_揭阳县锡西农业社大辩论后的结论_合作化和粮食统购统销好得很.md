(Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th dispatch) The Xixi Agricultural Cooperative in Xichang Township, Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, recently launched a great debate on the two roads, and the cooperative members distinguished between right and wrong and greatly improved their socialist consciousness.

Before the debate, the Party branch first mobilized the entire cooperative to fully unleash and express opinions. The most opinions from the cooperative members concerned the issues of cooperativization and the unified purchase and sale of grain. Some people said it was good, some said it was bad. Wealthy peasants Lin Meizai, Lin Zhongwen, and Lin Huaqin and others shouted loudly, saying that "cooperativization is terrible," "unified purchase and sale is suffocating," and also said that "the lives of cooperative members have not improved," and so on. The Party branch posted all these remarks on the blackboard newspaper, with the title: "Who is right and wrong, everyone come and discuss; Whether it is good or bad, calculating the accounts will reveal the details;" At the same time, it convened a meeting of poor peasant representatives, collected specific materials, and organized a debate team.

After full deliberation, the debate began.

Is cooperativization good or not? 90% of the members of Xixi Cooperative said "very good!" Everyone presented many facts: After cooperativization in 1955, the yield of rice per mu increased from 930 jin in 1953 to 1,030 jin, and in 1956 it increased again to 1,122 jin, an increase of more than 20%. Before liberation, the average yield per mu was only more than 700 jin. The increase in sugarcane production was even more prominent, with the yield per mu in 1954 being 6,800 jin, and in 1956 it increased to 12,600 jin, an increase of nearly doubled. Before liberation, each mu only produced more than 1,000 jin. Sideline production also developed rapidly. Before cooperativization, there were only two brick kilns, but now there are 17, with annual income reaching more than 120,000 yuan. Pig raising has also increased from 705 heads last year to 1,100 heads.

With the development of production, the lives of cooperative members have greatly improved. In 1955, there were 975 cooperative member households, more than 4,300 people, and the total income of the cooperative from agriculture and sideline occupations was more than 290,000 yuan. Each labor day earned 1.25 yuan, the average income per household was 193 yuan, and the average per person was 43.60 yuan. In 1956, the number of cooperative member households increased to 983, more than 4,584 people, and the total income of the cooperative from agriculture and sideline occupations was 430,000 yuan. Each labor day earned 1.70 yuan, the average income per household was 248 yuan, and the average income per person was 61 yuan. The vast majority of cooperative members increased their income and reached the living standards of middle peasants. Fifty-year-old female cooperative member Aunt Jingru criticized Lin Zhongwen, saying: "The cooperative is increasing production year after year, why do you say the cooperative is not good? You want to take the capitalist road, want to destroy the cooperative, you have turned over but have forgotten your roots!" Poor peasant cooperative member Lin Yingshen refuted Lin Meizai and others, saying: "It is not 40% of the people who want to withdraw from the cooperative, but more than 90% of the people who do not want to follow you on the old capitalist road."

Like agricultural cooperativization, the unified purchase and sale of grain is also very good. This is the conclusion reached after the great debate. Xixi Cooperative has less land and is an economic crop area, and it still lacked grain after liberation. Last year, the state supplied 3,500 dan of grain. If it were not for the unified purchase and sale, calculated at the black market price of 14 yuan per dan, it would have cost more than 24,000 yuan. If it were before liberation, and grain merchants were allowed to raise prices, it would have been even worse. In 1954, each person's monthly ration was 30 jin of rice, and now it has increased to more than 33 jin. The cooperative members asked Lin Meizai and others in succession: "What are your intentions in saying that the unified purchase and sale is suffocating? You want to engage in grain speculation." Lin Meizai and others were refuted to the point of speechlessness and had to admit their mistakes.

    揭阳县锡西农业社大辩论后的结论
    合作化和粮食统购统销好得很
    本报广州26日电　广东揭阳县锡场乡锡西农业社最近展开了两条道路的大辩论，社员分清了大是大非，社会主义觉悟大大提高。
    在辩论之前，党支部先发动全社大放大鸣，社员意见最多的是合作化和粮食统购统销问题。有的人说好，有的人说坏，富裕农民林妹仔、林钟文和林华钦等大叫大喊，说“合作化糟得很”，“统购统销限死人”，又说“社员生活没有改善”，等等。党支部一面把这些言论全部登在黑板报上，标题写着：“谁是谁非大家来讨论；是好是坏算账便知详”；一面召开贫农代表会议，收集具体材料，组织辩论队伍。
    经过充分酝酿，辩论展开了。
    究竟合作化好不好呢？锡西社90％的社员都说“好得很！”大家拿出了许多事实：1955年合作化后，水稻每亩产量从1953年的九百三十斤提高到一千零三十斤，1956年又增加到一千一百二十二斤，增产20％以上。而解放前每亩平均产量只七百多斤。甘蔗增产更突出，1954年每亩产量六千八百斤，1956年提高到一万二千六百斤，增产将近一倍。而解放前每亩只产一千多斤。副业生产也发展很快，合作化前只有两个砖窑，现在已增加到十七个，每年收入达十二万多元。养猪也由去年的七百零五头增加到一千一百头。
    随着生产的发展，社员生活得到很大改善。1955年社员九百七十五户，四千三百多人，全社农副业总收入二十九万多元，每个劳动日分得一元二角五分，每户平均收入一百九十三元，每人平均是四十三元六角；1956年社员增加到九百八十三户，四千五百八十四人，全社农副业总收入四十三万元，每个劳动日分得一元七角，每户平均收入二百四十八元，每人平均收入六十一元，绝大部分的社员都增加了收入，达到了中农的生活水平。五十多岁的女社员敬如婶批评林钟文说：“合作社年年增产，你为什么说合作社不好？你是想走资本主义道路，想破坏合作社，你翻了身却忘了本！”贫农社员林映深批驳林妹仔等说：“不是四成的人想退社，而是九成以上的人不愿跟你们走资本主义旧道路。”
    同农业合作化一样，粮食统购统销也是好得很。这是大辩论后得出的结论。锡西社土地较少，又是经济作物区，解放后还是缺粮。去年就由国家供应粮食三千五百担，如果不是统购统销，按照粮食黑市每担十四元计算，就要多付出二万四千多元。如果在解放前，任由粮商抬价，那就更不得了。1954年，每人每月口粮有三十斤稻谷，现在已增加到三十三斤多。社员连问林妹仔等说：“你们说统购统销限死人是什么用心？你们想做粮食投机买卖。”林妹仔等被驳得哑口无言，只得承认错误。
