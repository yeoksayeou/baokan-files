Qingdao's Industry Develops Rapidly
	Eight Years of Liberation Surpass the Previous Fifty
	(Our newspaper reports) According to the Qingdao Daily, Qingdao's industrial production has seen tremendous development since liberation. In 1956, the total output value increased by 1.18 times compared to the highest pre-war year of 1936, and by 198.8% compared to 1950, nearly doubling. The scale and speed of industrial development in the past eight years have surpassed the previous fifty years before liberation.
	Qingdao's industry was on its last breath on the eve of liberation. By 1949, the city's electricity production had decreased by 24.4% compared to 1936, steel production had decreased by 31%, and cotton cloth production had decreased by more than 44%. Only 15% of the approximately 300 private factories were operating, 40% were partially suspended, and 45% were completely shut down.
	After liberation, the Party and the People's Government rapidly restored production through a series of democratic reforms and production technology reforms. Especially after entering the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the city's industry has developed rapidly. For example, steel production in 1956 increased by 2,461% compared to 1950, electricity production increased by 76%, cotton cloth production increased by 67.4%, cotton yarn production increased by 31%, rubber shoe production increased by 68%, and paper production increased by 341.4%. The variety and quality of products have also greatly increased and improved since liberation. For example, the Sifang Locomotive Factory, from the time it was built by German imperialists, through three generations of operation by Japanese imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, had not officially produced a single locomotive in nearly fifty years by the time of liberation. However, in the third year after liberation, it produced a new type of locomotive, and the number increased year by year, reaching more than sixty locomotives produced in 1956. Furthermore, more than forty new products such as bicycles and sewing machines, which could not be produced before liberation, can now be produced in large quantities. Many new products such as chemical raw materials, rubber, medicines, and daily necessities were also previously impossible to produce.
	After liberation, some central state-owned factories, such as the Sifang Locomotive Factory and the Rubber Factory, have been renovated and expanded. 42 local state-owned factories have also been appropriately expanded and renovated under the principle of "small investment, big effect, and quick results." The newly established seaweed gum factory in June this year uses natural marine resources, specifically kelp, as raw materials to produce industrial raw materials. This factory can produce 40 tons of seaweed gum annually, supplying it to the city and some domestic dyeing and printing factories as a substitute for starch as a sizing agent, saving 560 tons of grain annually.

### 青岛市工业发展迅速  解放八年赛过从前五十年

    青岛市工业发展迅速
    解放八年赛过从前五十年
    本报讯　据青岛日报报道：青岛市工业生产在解放后有了巨大的发展，1956年总产值比战前最高年——1936年增长了一点一八倍多，比1950年增长了198.8％，近两倍。八年来工业发展的规模和速度，超过了解放前五十年。
    青岛市工业在解放前夕已是奄奄待毙。到1949年全市电力生产比1936年降低了24.4％，钢材的产量降低了31％，棉布的产量降低了44％多，三百户左右的私营工厂仅有15％开工，40％处于半停工，45％处于全部停工的状态。
    解放后，党和人民政府通过一系列的民主改革和生产技术改革，迅速恢复了生产。特别是进入第一个五年计划建设时期以后，全市工业更有了飞速的发展。如钢的产量1956年比1950年提高了2，461％，电力的产量提高了76％，棉布的产量提高了67.4％，棉纱的产量提高了31％，胶鞋的产量提高了68％，纸的产量提高了341.4％。在产品的品种和质量方面，解放后也有很大增加和提高。如四方机车厂，从德国帝国主义建厂开始，中经日本帝国主义、国民党反动派三代经营，到解放时近五十年，没正式生产出一台机车。但在解放后第三年就出产了新型的火车头，并且逐年增多，到1956年就生产了六十多辆机车。再如自行车、缝纫机等四十余种新产品，在解放前都不能生产，解放后却能大量生产了。有好多化工原料、橡胶、医药、日用生活杂品等新产品，也都是过去所不能生产的。
    解放后，一部分中央国营工厂，像四方机车厂、橡胶厂等，都进行了改建和扩建。42个地方国营厂，在“投资少、效果大、收效快”的原则下，也进行了适当的扩建和改建。今年6月间新建立的海藻胶厂、是利用天然海产资源马尾藻为原料来生产工业原料的。这个厂可年产四十吨海藻胶，供给全市和部分国内印染厂代替淀粉当糊料使用，全年能节约粮食五百六十吨。（附图片）
