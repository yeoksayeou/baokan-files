　　Nasser Denounces American Aggressive Ambitions
    Egypt Will Fully Support Syria's Struggle
　　American Divisive Tricks Will Never Succeed
　　Syrian Government Leaders Welcome Nasser's Remarks
　　Firmly Believe Egypt Stands with Syria
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 10th: Egyptian President Nasser said on September 9th that Egypt will continue to provide Syria with unlimited and unconditional support. Regardless of the form of pressure exerted on Syria, Egypt will support Syria's struggle with all its political, economic, and military might. He said that this struggle "is also our struggle, the struggle of Arab nationalism."
    In a private interview with "Al-Ahram" editor-in-chief, Hussein Heikal, Nasser pointed out that the Syrian crisis was created by the United States to undermine Arab unity and weaken its strength. The motive behind the United States' activities in Syria cannot be explained by its concern that Syria will turn to the communist camp, because it knows this is not true; nor can it be explained by American naivety or nervousness about communism. The United States knows very well that Syria will not abandon its policy of non-alignment. The real purpose of the United States in Syria is to "eliminate pressure on Israel, divert attention from it, and shift this attention to other areas that are in line with the interests of American policy."
    Nasser warned that US policy has confused some Arab countries, making them believe that the danger comes from Syria, thereby diverting Arab attention from Israel.
    Nasser said that the developments in the Syrian crisis show that the scope of the American plan is even broader. Like the delivery of arms to pro-Western Arab countries, all the steps taken by the United States are planned and closely coordinated. There are two noteworthy aspects of this process: first, the speed of arms delivery is unusually rapid, and a large-scale intimidation campaign is being carried out against some kings, presidents, and people. Second, it is light weapons rather than heavy weapons that are to be transported. This is very likely to strengthen the internal control of these countries, to prevent the tide of Arab nationalism, and to eliminate it if possible.
    President Nasser said: "I have five years of experience dealing with American policy, and I have come to the conclusion that it wants to achieve three goals for the Arab countries: First, to resolve the Israeli issue on the basis of maintaining the status quo. In other words, this means turning the armistice line into a permanent border and depriving the Palestinian Arabs of all rights. Second, to add (to the Arab countries) a defense agreement that would only benefit the United States. Third, to make the Arab countries consistently support US policy on all international issues, thereby turning the Arab countries into the sphere of influence of the United States."
    He said: "The US Middle East policy has always been to achieve these goals. Although the means are different, the goals remain unchanged." He pointed out that these means include the "Middle East Command" plan proposed by the United States in 1951, as well as the Baghdad Pact and arms monopoly. "The Eisenhower Doctrine" "is only a new attempt to achieve these goals." Basically, the Eisenhower Doctrine is a complete military alliance. It includes various military aspects, so it is a substitute for the Middle East Defense Plan that was rejected in 1951. This is also an expansion of the Baghdad Pact, the purpose of this expansion is to revitalize the Baghdad Pact.
    President Nasser emphasized that, in the final analysis, the entire problem of Syria is a premeditated plan to control Syria and force it to submit. When the internal subversion conspiracy failed, external actions began, and an artificial crisis was created in an attempt to exaggerate it. American policy is to keep the crisis boiling, which is necessary for promoting its psychological warfare.
    President Nasser ridiculed the American conspiracy to sow discord between Egypt and Syria. He said: "I recently read some articles in American newspapers that praised me for the first time in a long time, because I was said to have expressed dissatisfaction with what happened in Damascus. This trick is an old trick. I know this, and I don't think I will fall for it."
    Baghdad News: Syrian President Kuwatly told a Damascus-based reporter from the Iraqi newspaper "People's Daily" that Egyptian President Nasser is wholeheartedly standing by Syria's side.
    He said that when he met with Nasser in Cairo recently, Nasser was not worried about Syria's policies at all.
    Kuwatly also said in an interview published in the "People's Daily" on the 9th: "Arab nationalism is stronger than at any time in history."
    Syrian Prime Minister Asali believed on September 9th that President Nasser's remarks to the "Al-Ahram" reporter were a very good talk, which refuted all the Western claims and exposed the Western conspiracy against Syria.
    He said that this talk reiterated that the policy adopted by Egypt and Syria of neither standing with the East nor standing with the West is a just Arab nationalist policy that is beneficial to all Arabs.
    Foreign Minister Bitar said that Nasser's remarks bankrupted the lies spread by imperialism against Syria. Bitar said that this talk guaranteed the unity of Syria and Egypt, and the two countries' joint cooperation to maintain peace and defeat imperialist aggression.

### 埃及将全力支持叙利亚斗争

　　纳赛尔痛斥美国侵略野心
    埃及将全力支持叙利亚斗争
　　美国挑拨离间的诡计绝不会得逞
　　叙政府领袖欢迎纳赛尔谈话
　　坚信埃及同叙利亚站在一边
    据新华社开罗10日电　埃及总统纳赛尔9月9日说，埃及将继续给予叙利亚以无限度的和无条件的支持。不管对叙利亚的压力采取什么形式，埃及将以它的全部政治、经济和军事的力量来支持叙利亚的斗争。他说，这个斗争“也是我们的斗争，即阿拉伯民族主义的斗争”。
    纳赛尔在单独接见“金字塔报”主编侯赛尼·海卡尔时指出，叙利亚危机是美国为了破坏阿拉伯的团结一致，从而削弱它的力量而一手制造出来的。美国在叙利亚的活动的动机不能解释为它耽心叙利亚转到共产党阵营里去，因为它知道这是不确实的；也不能解释为美国人幼稚，或者对于共产主义的神经过敏。美国非常明白，叙利亚是不会放弃它的不参加集团政策的。美国对叙利亚的真正目的是想“消除对以色列的压力，转移对它的注意力，并且把这种注意力转移到符合美国政策利益的别的方面去。”
    纳赛尔警告说，美国的政策已经迷惑了一些阿拉伯国家，使它们相信危险来自叙利亚，从而转移了阿拉伯人对以色列的注意力。
    纳赛尔说，叙利亚危机发生的事态发展表明美国计划的范围更加广泛。像运送军火给亲西方的阿拉伯国家那样，美国的一切步骤都是有计划的和密切配合的。这个过程有两个值得注意的方面：第一、运军火的速度异乎寻常地迅速，以及对一些国王、总统和人民进行大规模的恫吓运动。第二、将要运去的是轻武器而不是重武器。这非常可能是想加强这些国家的内部控制，阻止阿拉伯民族主义潮流，如果可能的话就消灭它。
    纳赛尔总统说：“我跟美国政策打交道已经有五年之久的经验，我得出的结论是，它对阿拉伯国家想达到三个目的：一、在维持现状的基础上解决以色列问题。换句话说，这意味着把停战线变成永久的疆界，并且剥夺巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的一切权利。二、增加（给阿拉伯国家）一项只会对美国有利的防务协定。三、使阿拉伯国家在一切国际问题上一致支持美国政策，从而把阿拉伯国家变成美国的势力范围。”
    他说：“美国的中东政策始终是要实现这些目的。手段虽然不一，但是目的始终不变。”他指出，这些手段包括美国在1951年提出的“中东司令部”计划，以及巴格达条约和军火垄断等。“艾森豪威尔主义”“仅仅是为了实现这些目的的一个新的尝试而已”。基本上说来，艾森豪威尔主义就是一个十足的军事联盟。它包括各个军事方面，因而它是一个代替在1951年被拒绝的中东防御计划的东西。这也是巴格达条约的扩大，这种扩大的目的在于重振巴格达条约。
    纳赛尔总统着重指出，归根结蒂，叙利亚的整个问题是一项企图控制叙利亚和迫使它低头的预谋计划。当内部颠覆阴谋失败了的时候，外部的行动就开始了，并且制造人为的危机，力图加以夸大。美国政策是要使危机继续鼎沸，这种情况对于推行它的心理战是必需的。
    纳赛尔总统嘲笑了美国企图使埃及和叙利亚不和的阴谋。他说：“我最近读了美国报纸上的一些文章，它们长期以来第一次赞扬了我，因为据说我曾对大马士革发生的事情表示不满。这种诡计是老把戏了。我知道这一点，我认为，我是不会上它的当的。”
    巴格达消息：叙利亚总统库阿特利对伊拉克“人民报”驻大马士革记者说，埃及总统纳赛尔全心全意站在叙利亚一边。
    他说，他最近在开罗同纳赛尔会面时，纳赛尔对叙利亚的政策一点也不感到担心。
    库阿特利在“人民报”9日刊登的谈话中还说：“阿拉伯民族主义比有史以来任何时期都更加强大。”
    叙利亚总理阿萨利9月9日认为，纳赛尔总统对“金字塔报”记者的谈话是一篇很好的谈话，它驳斥了西方的一切说法，揭露了西方对叙利亚的阴谋。
    他说，这篇谈话重申，埃叙两国采取的既不同东方站在一起也不同西方站在一起的政策，是正当的阿拉伯民族主义政策，这种政策是有利于全体阿拉伯人的。
    外交部长比塔尔说，纳赛尔的谈话使帝国主义散布的反对叙利亚的谎言破产了。比塔尔说，这篇谈话保证了叙利亚同埃及的团结，以及两国共同合作来维护和平和击败帝国主义的侵略。
