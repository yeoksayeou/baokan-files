Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 23rd: The newly established Guangzhou Municipal Cantonese Opera Troupe Adjustment Committee has adjusted the seven state-owned troupes under the city's jurisdiction. The previous situation in these troupes, where improper role assignments and insufficient use of strengths affected the quality of performances, has been changed. This is one of the measures taken by Guangzhou's cultural and artistic departments to actively improve their work in accordance with the spirit of rectification while correcting.

    So far, out of the 386 criticisms and suggestions put forward by cultural and artistic circles and other members of the public, 226 have been resolved or are being resolved. The remaining issues, which are being passed on to relevant parties for reference or cannot be resolved temporarily, have also been explained.

    Regarding how to enrich and improve music, quyi (folk art forms), and storytelling programs, Guangzhou has also begun to organize forces, with the Municipal Bureau of Culture, the Musicians Association, and the Quyi Association jointly excavating and sorting out some traditional programs that were popular among the masses in the past. Regarding the problem of insufficient and uneven distribution of performance venues, Guangzhou's cultural and artistic departments have decided that, in addition to appropriately building several new venues such as open-air acrobatics and magic venues and a western district quyi venue, the existing six cinemas and theaters will be expanded and re-equipped, and the Xinhua Cinema will be converted into a widescreen cinema. In addition, a concert hall will be established in the Cultural Park as a venue for music and quyi performances. Cultural palaces, clubs, and other venues in the city that can be used for performances will also be fully utilized. Not long ago, leading cadres of the Municipal Bureau of Culture also went deep into various quyi performance venues to understand the situation and discuss solutions to performance rehearsals, actor rest, and other issues with relevant parties.

    Many improvements have also been made to the working and living conditions of cultural and artistic workers and amateur art enthusiasts. Guangzhou has decided to open a place for artists to display and sell their works, which will be managed by the Artists Association. Unemployed artists will be given appropriate relief and subsidies. The Municipal Cultural Center has also held six training classes in music, dance, and fine arts, and allocated funds to the cultural centers in various districts for the construction of small stages and the renovation of venue equipment.

    广州文化部门努力改进工作
    新华社广州23日电　广州市新成立的全市粤剧团调整委员会，已对市属的七个国营剧团进行调整。这些剧团过去因角色搭配不当，力量使用不够完善，以致影响演出质量的状况已经改变。这是广州市文化艺术部门根据边整边改精神积极改进工作的措施之一。
    到目前为止，全市文化艺术界人士和其他群众提出的三百八十六件批评和建议，已经解决和正在解决的已达二百二十六件，其余属于转达有关方面参考和暂时不能解决的问题，也分别作了交代。
    对于如何丰富和提高音乐、曲艺、说书节目的问题，广州市也已经着手组织力量，由市文化局、音乐家协会和曲艺联谊会共同发掘整理一些过去为群众所喜闻乐道的传统节目。对表演场所不足和分配不均的问题，广州市文化艺术部门已决定，除适当新建露天杂技魔术场、西区曲艺场等几个场所外，对原有的六个影剧院分别进行扩建，重新添换设备，并且把新华电影院改建为宽银幕电影院。另外在文化公园设立音乐厅，作为音乐、曲艺演唱场所，市内文化宫、俱乐部及其他可供表演的场地，也要充分加以利用。不久以前，市文化局领导干部还深入到各曲艺演出场所，了解情况，和有关方面研究解决演出排演、演员休息等问题。
    对文化、艺术工作者和业余艺术爱好者的工作、生活条件问题，也作了许多改进。广州市已决定开辟美术家陈列作品和代售作品场所，由美术家协会负责管理。对失业艺人将予以适当的救济补助。市文化馆也举办了音乐、舞蹈、美术等六个训练班，并拨款给各区文化馆作为建设小型舞台及修饰场所设备之用。
