Yiliang County Yongxin Society's Landlord and Rich Peasant Elements

Still Unruly and Unlawfully After Changing Their Class Status; The Masses Re-Label Them

(Reported by this newspaper) Fifteen landlords and rich peasants in Yongxin Society, Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, who had had their class status changed, have been re-labeled as landlords and rich peasants.

During the attack on the Party by bourgeois right-wingers in the cities, some reactionary landlords and rich peasants in Yongxin Society took the opportunity to launch a counter-attack for settling old scores. The daughter-in-law of the landlord, Duan Heqing, demanded the return of the house that had been distributed during the land reform, and repeatedly drove the poor peasant, Lao Hei, to move out. The rich peasant, Chen Jin, even illegally cut down the cooperative's bamboo and fabricated facts to provoke disunity between teams. The landlord, Meng Jiayue, repeatedly beat the poor peasant, Chen Kaixing, who lived in the same courtyard, and clamored for rebellion.

Recently, with the unfolding of the great blooming and contending in the countryside, the ideological understanding of rural Party members and cadres has been raised. They mobilized the masses by village, convened separate meetings of poor and lower-middle peasants and all peasants, and launched a reasoned struggle against reactionary landlords and rich peasants. After the struggle, punishments were meted out according to the nature and severity of their illegal and destructive actions. Among them, twelve people were re-labeled as landlords, and three were re-labeled as rich peasants.

    宜良县永新社的地主富农分子
    改变成分以后仍不安分守法  群众给他们重新戴上“帽子”
    本报讯　云南省宜良县永新社十五个改变成份的地主、富农重新戴上地主、富农帽子。
    在城市资产阶级右派分子向党进攻的时候，永新社的一部分反动地主富农乘机进行反攻倒算。地主段鹤清媳妇要收回土地改革时被分了的房子，曾几次撵贫农老黑搬走。富农陈锦，竟私自滥伐合作社的竹子，并捏造事实，挑拨队与队的团结。地主孟家越，几次痛打了与他同住一院的贫农陈开兴，并扬言要造反。
    最近，在农村中展开大鸣大争，农村党员、干部的思想认识提高了。他们分村发动群众，分别召开了贫农、下中农和全体农民会议，开展了对反动地主富农的说理斗争。斗争之后，依他们违法破坏的性质和情节轻重，分别予以处罚。其中重新戴上地主帽子的有十二人，重新戴上富农帽子的有三人。
