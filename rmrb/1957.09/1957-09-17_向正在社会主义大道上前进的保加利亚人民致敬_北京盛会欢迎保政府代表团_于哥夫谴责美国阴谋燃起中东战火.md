Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Chairman Yugov said at a mass meeting in Beijing today, held by people from all walks of life to welcome the Bulgarian Government Delegation, that "The unwavering unity between socialist countries is the main condition for our victorious advance." In his speech, Yugov also strongly condemned a series of provocative acts by imperialism attempting to split the socialist camp and undermine world peace.

The distinguished guests, headed by Yugov, arrived at the Beijing Gymnasium at 4:30 PM, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai. They were greeted at the entrance by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Mayor Peng Zhen of Beijing, and others. When the distinguished guests appeared on the rostrum, the entire venue erupted in prolonged and enthusiastic applause and cheers. After the band played the national anthems of Bulgaria and China, gorgeously dressed young women from Beijing presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

In his speech, Yugov said that the Chinese people, like the Bulgarian people, deeply understand that the unwavering unity between socialist countries is the main condition for our victorious advance. The Bulgarian people and the Chinese people both have love and gratitude for our powerful friend and loyal ally—the great Soviet Union. The great Soviet Union has been, is, and will continue to be a model for us to learn from.

Yugov said that recent events have proven that the unity of socialist countries has not weakened, but on the contrary, has become increasingly consolidated and developed. Today, all the efforts of the people in our camp converge like a surging river flowing into the ocean of socialism. Whoever attempts to undermine or change this unstoppable torrent will surely be submerged in it.

Yugov severely condemned the imperialist policy of aggression. He said: "We cannot remain indifferent when the United States is conspiring to ignite the flames of war in the Near and Middle East, and when the United States is attempting to drag Turkey, which is adjacent to our country, into a war against Syria."

Yugov's enthusiastic speech was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged and enthusiastic applause like a sudden rainstorm.

Before Chairman Yugov's speech, Mayor Peng Zhen, on behalf of all citizens of Beijing, delivered a speech expressing his heartfelt welcome to Chairman Yugov and the Bulgarian Government Delegation. In his welcome speech, Peng Zhen warmly praised the tremendous achievements Bulgaria has made in socialist construction, and congratulated them on making even greater achievements.

Peng Zhen said that the Bulgarian people have made many contributions to consolidating the unity of socialist countries and have made unremitting efforts to defend European and world peace. The Chinese people fully support these efforts of the Bulgarian people and will continue to fight side by side with the Bulgarian people and advance together.

Amidst warm applause from the entire audience, Mayor Peng Zhen presented flags and gifts to Chairman Yugov and the Bulgarian Government Delegation on behalf of the people of Beijing. On the red brocade flag was embroidered in gold thread: "The people of all circles in Beijing salute the Bulgarian people who are advancing on the glorious road of building socialism! Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people!" During the presentation of gifts, Chairman Yugov and Mayor Peng Zhen warmly embraced and kissed each other.

After the meeting, literary and art circles in the capital also performed wonderful programs, and the distinguished guests visited the Beijing Gymnasium.

All members of the delegation visited the Beijing Vacuum Tube Factory this morning.

　　向正在社会主义大道上前进的保加利亚人民致敬
　　北京盛会欢迎保政府代表团
　　于哥夫谴责美国阴谋燃起中东战火
    新华社16日讯　于哥夫主席在今天北京各界人民欢迎保加利亚政府代表团的群众大会上说：“社会主义国家之间的不可动摇的团结是我们胜利前进的主要条件。”于哥夫在讲话中并强烈地谴责了帝国主义企图分裂社会主义阵营和破坏世界和平的一系列挑衅行为。
    以于哥夫为首的贵宾们在下午四时半由周恩来总理陪同来到北京体育馆，他们在入口处受到了李先念副总理和北京市彭真市长等人的迎接。贵宾们出现在主席台上时，整个会场响起了长时间热烈的鼓掌声和欢呼声。在乐队高奏保、中两国国歌后，盛装的北京市女青年们向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    于哥夫在讲话中说，中国人民正如保加利亚人民一样，深刻地认识到，社会主义国家之间的不可动摇的团结是我们胜利前进的主要条件。保加利亚人民和中国人民都对我们强大的朋友和忠实的同盟者——伟大的苏联怀着热爱和感激。伟大的苏联过去、现在和将来都是我们学习的榜样。
    于哥夫说，最近的事件证明，社会主义国家的团结不但没有削弱，而相反地愈来愈巩固和发展。今天，我们阵营中人民的一切努力汇聚在一起就像澎湃的河流注入社会主义的海洋。谁企图破坏或改变这个不可遏止的洪流，谁就一定会沉没在这个洪流里。
    于哥夫严厉谴责了帝国主义的侵略政策。他说：“当美国在中近东进行燃起战火的阴谋的时候，当美国企图把同我国毗邻的土耳其拖入反对叙利亚战争的时候，我们不能无动于衷。”
    于哥夫的热情讲话，不时地被会场上长时间急雨般的热烈掌声所打断。
    在于哥夫主席讲话前，彭真市长代表北京市全体市民致词对于哥夫主席和保加利亚政府代表团表示衷心地欢迎。彭真在欢迎词中热情地赞扬了保加利亚在社会主义建设中已经取得的巨大成就，并祝贺他们进一步取得更大成就。
    彭真说，保加利亚人民在巩固社会主义各国的团结方面作出了许多贡献，并且为保卫欧洲和世界和平进行了不懈的努力。中国人民完全支持保加利亚人民的这种努力，并且将继续同保加利亚人民共同奋斗，并肩前进。
    彭真市长在全场热烈掌声中代表北京市人民向于哥夫主席和保加利亚政府代表团献旗、献礼。在红色的锦旗上用金线绣着：“北京市各界人民向正在建设社会主义的光辉大道上前进的保加利亚人民致敬！中保两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！”在献礼时，于哥夫主席和彭真市长热烈地互相拥抱和亲吻。
    在大会结束后，首都文艺界还表演了精彩节目，贵宾们并参观了北京体育馆。
