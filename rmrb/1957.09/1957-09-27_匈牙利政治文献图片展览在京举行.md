The main content of the Hungarian Political Document Photo Exhibition can be divided into four parts: the painful life suffered by the Hungarian people under the reactionary rule of Horthy and the revolutionary struggle of the Hungarian people for liberation before liberation; the liberation of Hungary by the Soviet Red Army in 1945 and the establishment of their own revolutionary regime by the Hungarian people; the achievements of Hungary's Three-Year Plan and the First Five-Year Plan; the Hungarian October counter-revolutionary riots and the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government.
