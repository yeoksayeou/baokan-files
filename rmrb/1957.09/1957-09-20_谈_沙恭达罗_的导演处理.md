　　On the Directorial Treatment of "Shakuntala"
　　Wu Xiaoling
    The China Youth Art Theatre has once again performed the great Indian classical drama "Shakuntala." I would like to raise a question and discuss my own shallow views, which is how we should stage Indian classical plays in China (especially in modern China).
    I originally strongly advocated for leaving it untouched, but after seeing this play, I believe that it can and should be carefully considered and appropriately modified. Of course, additions, deletions, and modifications should ideally not harm or distort the spirit and sentiment of the original work. From the perspective of our own drama development history, there seem to be two approaches regarding additions, deletions, and modifications. To cite a more distant example, Li Jingyun of the Ming Dynasty adapting Wang Dexin's "Romance of the Western Chamber" from a Northern Zaju into a Southern Chuanqi can be said to represent one approach. Li Jingyun's adaptation retained the vast majority of the original lyrics, only making some changes in terms of scenes. The main purpose of this approach was to enable the play to be performed on stage. To cite a more recent example, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian adapting Kong Shangren's "The Peach Blossom Fan" from traditional opera into a modern drama can be said to represent another approach. The main difference between these two scripts is not merely that one has recitations and singing while the other only has dialogue; rather, the latter was infused with the spirit of the times by the playwright. The main purpose of this approach is to allow today's audience to appreciate and understand it.
      The Chinese director of "Shakuntala" seems to have adopted both of these approaches. In terms of the former: many lines were deleted, and many characters were discarded. The seven-act play was compressed into a six-scene play; the third and fourth acts were combined into one scene, with the third act serving as a "transition" for the fourth act. The "Fisherman Finds the Ring" and "Palace Maids Welcoming Spring" scenes in the sixth act were both changed to "blackouts." In this way, adopting this method of concentration and compression can add plot to this essentially lyrical play. In addition, the director added some things to the play that were not in the original, mainly four dances. The first is the bird and animal dance in the Pure Forest at the beginning of the first act, which mainly attempts to create an atmosphere of peaceful and tranquil Pure Forest where "all beings do not harm each other, and all things are equal," so that the earth-shattering momentum of King Dushyanta leading thousands of troops to hunt can be highlighted. The second is the palace maids' dance in the fourth scene. This dance depicts the emptiness and restlessness of King Dushyanta's state of mind, supplementing the lack of inner performance and subtext of the actors. The third is Prince Bharata's lion dance in the sixth scene, and the fourth is the "Hundred Flowers in Bloom" dance at the end of the play. These two dances also clearly show the director's technique, especially at the end, always wanting to correspond to the beginning bird and animal dance in a grand and sweeping manner, and also having to end with "lingering sound around the beams" and "the words are exhausted but the meaning is endless." All of these additions and deletions by the director, I think, are to make the play more plot-rich. In terms of the latter: the most prominent is the last scene, which is the sixth scene adapted from the original seventh act. Kalidasa wrote that after King Dushyanta and Shakuntala fell in love in the Pure Forest, he forgot Shakuntala due to a curse from a sage upon returning to the capital, so that even when the hermits in the forest sent Shakuntala to the palace, he would not accept her. As a result, Shakuntala was taken to heaven by the Mother of the Earth, where she gave birth to Prince Bharata and spent six or seven melancholic years. On the way back from his victorious demon-slaying in heaven, King Dushyanta unintentionally encountered Shakuntala and her son, and they were reunited again. Here, our director made a bold change. He did not change the happy ending of the seventh act, but treated the original story as King Dushyanta's dream.
    My meaning of saying this is a "bold change" is that the original plot of the story was that King Dushyanta did not recognize Shakuntala, and only after Kalidasa's painstaking effort did it become a real reunion result, and our director actually changed the real artistic conception created by Kalidasa into an unreal artistic conception. I don't care how the Chinese audience reacts, and I will not consider for the time being whether the Indian teachers and scholars can fully agree to such a change. I will only talk about my own feelings. I think there is a reason for doing so. The director probably did not fail to consider this issue when dealing with this problem, this matter is no small matter! I am afraid the director saw at once that the romantic color of this script is quite strong, so by slightly moving his hand and changing the meeting on "fairy mountains on the sea" into a dream in the "illusory and ethereal space," it seems to make the romantic atmosphere more unified and more consistent with the style of the entire script. This is one aspect. From another perspective, this approach not only unifies the style of the original, but also simultaneously infuses it with the blood of realism. The director may well realize that in ancient India, just as in ancient China, the fate of women was in the hands of men, and not something that could be manipulated by the curses of great immortals. Therefore, King Dushyanta's affection for Shakuntala in the Pure Forest was not "love at first sight," but "picking flowers and getting involved." It is expected and reasonable that he would forget Shakuntala and even abandon her in person when he returned to the embrace of "three thousand beauties in the harem." Shakuntala, a pure soul, can only seek the happiness she cannot obtain in dreams. Her fate is the common fate of women in ancient India. The director's treatment of this scene, I think, is for today's Chinese audience to appreciate and understand. Therefore, I believe that the director adopted the two adaptation methods mentioned earlier, he wanted to "preserve" Kalidasa's lyric poetry, and also wanted to make this play be loved by modern Chinese audiences.
    This is a new attempt, a bold attempt, an attempt to solve the problem. Such attempts are worthy of our attention.
    Of course, I should also say that this is the first time an Indian classical drama has been brought to the Chinese stage, and it is also a play by the foremost writer in Indian classical drama. We want to celebrate this good start.

### 谈“沙恭达罗”的导演处理

　　谈“沙恭达罗”的导演处理
　　吴晓铃
    中国青年艺术剧院再一次演出了印度的伟大的古典剧“沙恭达罗”。我想提出一个问题来谈一谈自己的粗浅的看法，这就是我们怎样在中国（特别是在现代的中国）演出印度古典剧作的问题。
    我本来是坚决主张原封不动的，看了这个戏以后却认为可以而且应该斟酌损益，加以适当的改动。当然，增删和改动最好不要伤害或是歪曲原作的精神和情趣。从我们自己的戏剧发展历史看来，关于增删和改动的情况似乎有两种方式。举远一些的例子来说，明代的李景云把元代的王德信的“西厢记”由北杂剧改编成为南传奇可以说是代表一种方式。李景云的改本绝大部分保留了原作的曲辞，只是在场次方面做了一些变动。这种方式的主要目的是为了能够在舞台上演出。举近一点的例子来说，欧阳予倩先生把清代的孔尚任的“桃花扇”由传统歌剧改编成为现代话剧可以说是代表另一种方式。这两个剧本的主要不同之点并不是一个是有念有唱、另一个只有话白；而是后者被剧作家注入了时代的精神。这种方式的主要目的是为了能够给今天的观众来欣赏、来理解。
      “沙恭达罗”的中国导演似乎是采取了这两种方式。就前者来说：许多台词被删去了，许多人物被舍弃了。七幕的戏压缩成为六场的戏；第三幕和第四幕合并成一场戏，第三幕做为第四幕的一个“过场”。第六幕的“渔父得宝”和“宫女迎春”两段戏都改成了“暗场”。这样，采取这种集中和压缩的办法就可以使这个基本上是抒情诗的戏增加剧情。另外，导演在剧中又加进去了一些原作里所没有的东西，那主要的是四场舞蹈，第一个是第一场开幕时候的净修林中的鸟兽舞，这主要的是企图创造一个“众生不相害，万物皆平等”的和平恬静的净修林的气氛，然后才好突出豆扇陀王率领千军万马前来狩猎的石破天惊的气势。第二个是第四场的宫廷中的婇女舞，这场舞蹈是刻画豆扇陀王的心境的空虚和烦躁的，它补充了演员内心表演和潜台词不足的空间。第三个是第六场的婆罗多太子的弄狮舞，第四个是剧末的“万花争荣”舞。这两场舞蹈也很清楚地看得出来是导演的手法，特别是在结尾的时候，总要大开大阖地和开始的鸟兽舞前后照应，还得要“余音绕梁”、“言有尽而意无穷”地煞住。导演的这一些增删损益，我想都是为了让这个戏更能够富有剧情。就后者来说：最突出的是最后的一场，就是由原作的第七幕改成的第六场。迦梨陀娑写的是豆扇陀王和沙恭达罗在净修林里定情之后，回到京城里由于仙人的咒诅就把沙恭达罗忘掉了，以致林中的隐士把沙恭达罗送到皇宫里都不被他收纳。结果沙恭达罗被大地的母亲接到天上去，在天上她生了婆罗多太子，过了六七个忧郁的年头。豆扇陀王在到天上降魔胜利的归途上无意间和沙恭达罗母子相遇，他们又重新团聚在一起。这里，我们的导演做了大胆的改动。他并没有改变第七幕的大团圆的情节，只是把原来的故事处理成为豆扇陀王的一场春梦。
    我说这是一个“大胆的改动”的意思是这个故事的原始情节本来是豆扇陀王不认沙恭达罗，经过迦梨陀娑煞费苦心的经营才变成了真实的团圆结果，我们的导演竟又把迦梨陀娑所经营创造的真实意境改成了不真实的意境。我且不管中国观众的反映如何，我也暂时先不考虑印度的老师宿儒对于这样的改动是不是能够完全同意。我只谈谈我自己的感受，我觉得这么干也有他的道理。导演在处理这个问题的时候，大约不是没有经过考虑的，这桩事儿可非同小可哇！恐怕导演一下子就看出来这个剧本的浪漫主义的色彩相当浓厚，因此稍微动一动手，把“海上有仙山”的会合变成“虚非缥渺间”的梦寐，似乎使浪漫主义的气息更加统一，更加贯串整个剧本的风格的一致。这是一个方面。再从另一个角度来谈，这种处理方法不单使原作的风格统一了，而且也同时输送进去了现实主义精神的血液。导演完全有可能体会到在古代印度正和在古代中国一样，妇女的命运是掌握在男人的手里的，并不是大仙的咒诅所能拨弄的。那么，豆扇陀王在净修林里和沙恭达罗的缱绻，并不是“一见钟情”，而是“惹草粘花”。他在回到“后宫佳丽三千人”的簇拥中，忘掉沙恭达罗以至于当面遗弃沙恭达罗都是意料得到的合情合理的事情。沙恭达罗，一个纯朴的灵魂，也只有在梦幻里寻求她所得不到的幸福，她的命运正是古代印度妇女的共同的命运。导演对于这一场的处理，我想是为了给今天的中国观众欣赏和理解。所以，我认为导演采取前面所说的两种改编方式，他既要“保住”迦梨陀娑的抒情诗，又要使这戏能够为现代中国的观众所喜爱。
    这是一个新的尝试，是一个有胆识的尝试，是一个企图解决问题的尝试。这样的尝试，是值得我们注意的。
    当然，我还应该说，这是第一个印度古典戏剧搬上中国舞台的第一次，而且还是演出的印度古典戏剧里的首屈一指的作家的剧作。我们要庆祝这个良好的开始。
