Huang Yaomian was given the title of "military advisor" because he fully exerted himself when the Zhang-Luo alliance launched a frenzied attack on the Party. He was appreciated by Zhang and Luo and promoted to Minister of the Propaganda Department of the China Democratic League Central Committee, becoming an effective theoretical propagandist for the Zhang-Luo alliance's attack on the Party.

One Hundred and One Opinions

At the Third Session of the National People's Congress last year, Comrade Li Weihan made a speech on the United Front. The China Democratic League discussed this speech a total of three times. Huang Yaomian presided over the first and third meetings, while Wu Jingchao presided over the second. At the first and third meetings, Huang Yaomian made opening and concluding remarks, while at the second meeting, he delivered a lengthy speech. Judging from the situation of the three meetings, Huang Yaomian played a leading role. During the meetings, rightist elements such as Zhang Yunchuan made many reactionary remarks. Luo Longji and Huang Yaomian repeatedly encouraged him. Afterwards, they compiled one hundred and one opinions. These "opinions" included: under the principle of mutual supervision, the democratic parties should correct their past practice of flattering the Communist Party and reporting only good news, not bad. Now the China Democratic League has a logic that whoever has a high political status, they think the Party values, is in demand, and immediately becomes the object of their efforts to win over and unite, and should be placed in a leading position. The "opinions" also maliciously provoked: there is also a trend now: if the Communist Party says something bad about someone, that person becomes a "stray dog," and everyone attacks him. This is a very vulgar principle. Some self-proclaimed progressive people in the democratic parties do not allow others to offer opinions. If anyone offers opinions, they are either said to be opposing the Communist Party or setting up a separate court, and they are labeled with all sorts of accusations.

Judging from these opinions, this meeting was clearly a meeting controlled by rightist elements, an attack on the Party and the leftists in the China Democratic League. At this meeting, Huang Yaomian's anti-Party "talent" was appreciated by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Therefore, Zhang Bojun used his position to buy off Huang Yaomian. Huang Yaomian became one of the main actors in the subsequent decision of the China Democratic League to turn to the right.

Role in the China Democratic League's Turn to the Right

The China Democratic League convened a national work conference in April this year. The central topic was to discuss and determine the future central work of the China Democratic League. Under the control of the Zhang-Luo alliance, rightist elements dominated the meeting, and the correct opinions of the leftists were suppressed. Throughout the entire meeting, Huang Yaomian was an ultra-rightist among the rightist elements. Huang Yaomian made both the initial general report and the concluding remarks of the meeting. The meeting was conducted in two stages. The first stage was to discuss Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, personally directed by Zhang and Luo, calling for "great airing of views and full expression of opinions." The second stage was to discuss four central issues. Huang Yaomian was the convener of the first group discussing "What exactly should the China Democratic League do in the future?" When the leading group discussed the draft prepared by Huang Yaomian, there were many different opinions on "What should the China Democratic League do in the future?" Some people advocated that the League supervise the Communist Party, others said to support the great airing of views and full expression of opinions, and only a few people such as Hu Yuzhi advocated focusing on cultural and educational work and ideological reform. Huang Yaomian insisted that the focus should be on "strengthening political work, supporting the great airing of views and full expression of opinions, and supervising the Communist Party." He believed that intellectuals have now become laborers, and emphasizing self-reform and improving political level is a passive manifestation. He ambitiously emphasized that so-called "coexistence" and "supervision" are in fact political democratization. When the Party proposes political democratization, and some people want to place the primary task of the China Democratic League on self-reform and cultural and educational aspects, then long-term coexistence will fail. At that time, Hu Yuzhi disagreed with this view, and a dispute arose. Zhang Bojun, seeing the situation was not good, had to come out to mediate. He said that there are still difficulties in conducting supervision now, such as people not being used to it, more than 90% of the people in the Communist Party oppose it, whether we propose it or not, it does not mean we are not supervising. At this time, Huang Yaomian expressed: I am convinced by Vice Chairman Zhang's statement. Under Zhang Bojun's two-faced tricks, the opinions of the leftists were suppressed. From then on, the China Democratic League was guided onto the dangerous path of turning to the right. And Huang Yaomian further gained the trust of Zhang and Luo. After the meeting, Zhang Bojun personally visited Huang Yaomian's home and proposed that he serve as the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the China Democratic League Central Committee. He said, "There is a great future in doing the work of the China Democratic League, and the position of the Minister of the China Democratic League is equivalent to the Deputy Minister of the Provincial Government." Huang happily accepted, and Huang Yaomian suddenly climbed onto the chair of the military advisor of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Chief of Staff in the Think Tank

Since serving as the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the China Democratic League Central Committee, Huang Yaomian has actively offered advice to the Zhang-Luo alliance. At a symposium of some responsible persons of the China Democratic League's Culture and Education, Propaganda, and Study Committees convened by Zhang and Luo on May 13, Huang Yaomian put forward strategies for attacking the Party. He demanded that the entire League's forces be mobilized to attack the Party. He said that the League Central Committee could grasp several major issues to carry out work, and select planning, school system, etc. for seminars. We can also send people to major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan to collect materials of dissatisfaction with the Party, and also investigate the situation in various universities in Beijing. Scientific planning should rely on experts. First, find experts within the League to put forward opinions, and invite delegates within the League who attended the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress to have two seminars. The second opinion is to suggest setting up a "Contending Views Monthly" [争鸣月刊社] , and criticisms do not need to be in the name of the China Democratic League, but should appear in the private capacity of the Contending Views Society, so that the criticisms will be more free. The third opinion is to advocate that the China Democratic League Central Committee establish a "Policy Research Committee" as a think tank for the Zhang-Luo alliance to attack the Party, with Huang serving as the Chief of Staff. He said that this committee is to design the blueprint for the Zhang-Luo alliance to attack the Party, and can also prepare speech materials and opinions for Zhang Bojun, so that Zhang Bojun will not talk nonsense. Zhang and Luo greatly appreciated Huang Yaomian's three strategies for attacking the Party. Later, under the manipulation of the Zhang-Luo alliance, a symposium was held, deciding to launch a frenzied attack on the Party in a planned way from various aspects, and immediately established four working groups: "Party Committee Responsible System," "Scientific Planning," "Having Authority with Responsibility," and "Supervision and Contending Views." Zhang and Luo also appointed Huang Yaomian as the head of the "Party Committee Responsible System" working group. Later, Huang Yaomian became the most powerful expert of the Zhang-Luo alliance in seizing the Party's leadership over universities.

Behind-the-Scenes Figure in "Democratically Run Schools"

When the "Democratically Run Schools" program by rightist Tao Dayong to seize the party's leadership over the Beijing Normal University was drafted, Huang Yaomian, in the name of the person in charge of the "Party Committee Responsible System" working group, convened Chu Shenglin of Peking University, Wu Jingchao and Hou Dagian of Renmin University, Lu Jinren of Agricultural University, and Tao Dayong of Beijing Normal University to further discuss the university system. Huang made a summary at the meeting. In order to realize the program of "Democratically Run Schools," on June 5, at a symposium of faculty and staff of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, Huang Yaomian personally opened fire on the Party, attempting to open a gap in Beijing Normal University first. At the meeting, he used the method of distorting facts to viciously attack and slander the Party's leadership and the Party's policy towards intellectuals. He said that the director of the Chinese Department had a position but no power, and he was being used as a toy. He also believed that the Party's policy of "unity, education, and transformation" towards intellectuals was actually implemented as the policy of "utilization, restriction, and transformation" in Beijing. He also said, "Don't memorize Lenin's individual words, like chanting scriptures. As soon as intellectuals are mentioned, there is 'antagonistic sentiment,' always treating intellectuals as alien elements. Running a school is not fighting a war, and you can't use the method of leading troops. It is also not a state power organ, and you can't use the law to handle affairs. But our school is full of mystery, and everything is confidential. It's not a fort or a warehouse, what things can't be made public? Teachers rely on knowledge to eat, not on ranking. But the grading in our school uses political power to improve academic status, which is using the method of becoming an official to run a school. Schools should be based on academics. Now some people, in order to become teaching assistants and lecturers, desperately drill into the Party like earthworms, thinking that this is a ladder to promotion and wealth. And the entire Party of Beijing Normal University is controlled by children, they are ignorant idiots, not only shielding the backward, but also full of bourgeois ideology within the Party. The Party is corrupting, generating fatal contradictions from within like capitalism." In short, Huang Yaomian's conclusion was: the Party cannot lead the country and universities, and should be led by intellectuals like him. He put on a righteous face and said, "The country is not owned by the Communist Party, and we should be responsible to the people." Then, on June 6, he attended the Six Professors Conference secretly convened by Zhang Bojun. According to the spirit of this meeting, and on the basis of the "Democratically Run Schools" program, on June 10, Huang Yaomian personally drafted and completed "Our Suggestions on the Leadership System of Universities" on behalf of the Zhang-Luo alliance. At this time, the anti-rightist struggle had already begun, but Huang Yaomian still blatantly proposed usurping the leadership of universities in this draft proposal, and was still wholeheartedly serving the Zhang-Luo alliance. Even when the conspiracy of "Democratically Run Schools" was exposed in the newspaper, Tao Dayong found Huang Yaomian, crying and asking him to protect him. Huang said, "Don't worry, I am responsible for this matter, you are not responsible." At a meeting of the China Democratic League, Huang Yaomian said that Tao Dayong was sent to Beijing Normal University by him.

Politician in a Scholar's Guise

After the faculty and students of Beijing Normal University exposed that rightist Huang Yaomian was a thorough politician in a scholar's guise, Huang Yaomian put on a mournful face and professed to everyone that he was a loyal, diligent, law-abiding scholar, denying that he was a politician attacking the Party, saying that his work has always been teaching first, writing articles second, and China Democratic League work third. Saying that he is a scholar who imparts knowledge and never engages in politics. These lies cannot cover up the facts.

The fact that rightist Huang Yaomian is anti-Party and anti-socialist is not accidental, but has historical origins. Huang Yaomian participated in the Party, was arrested during the Great Revolution, and went to Yan'an after being released from prison. The Party wanted to examine him, but he hated it very much and left angrily. This time, colluding with the Zhang-Luo alliance to attack the Party is a further development of his years of hatred for the Party. Huang Yaomian is the director of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University. The school trusts him very much and respects his authority, but he has been threatening to resign for several years, and rarely intervenes in the work of the department, while shouting everywhere that he has a position but no power. In the past two years, Huang Yaomian has spent less and less time on teaching, and it is common to be late for class, and sometimes he even takes the wrong teaching outline. Originally, his main time and energy was spent colluding with Zhang and Luo, doing things that were anti-Party and anti-socialist. When Pan Shixiong, a rightist from Tianjin Normal College, came to Beijing this year to attend a teaching conference, Huang Yaomian collected intellectuals' grievances from him and gave instructions. When Shen Zaoxiang of Beijing Normal University went to Shanxi to conduct correspondence tutoring, Huang asked him to collect materials from the cultural and educational circles in Shanxi that were dissatisfied with the Party and the government. Huang Yaomian also took a car to Tsinghua and Peking University to see big-character posters and visit professors to collect materials. Rightist Tao Dayong once asked him why he was working so hard for Zhang and Luo, and Huang Yaomian said without hiding, "To eat the political rice of the China Democratic League." Huang Yaomian also has a set of clever methods. He taught Tao Dayong to be "more active outside" and cultivate sensitivity to the "political climate"; in order to obtain "academic fame" and establish "prestige" among the masses, he must observe the "political climate" from time to time and write official articles. At the same time, in order to be "invincible" when criticized, he must be familiar with Marxist-Leninist books. Huang Yaomian's "secrets" and his anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds prove that he is a politician in a scholar's guise.

    章罗联盟的军师——黄药眠
    本报记者　孙祖年
    黄药眠为什么能获得军师的称号呢？就是他在章、罗联盟向党发动猖狂进攻的时候，充分卖力，为章罗所赏识，被提拔为民盟中央宣传部部长，成为章、罗联盟向党进攻得力的理论宣传家。
    一百零一条意见
    去年召开的全国人民代表大会第三次会议上，李维汉同志作一个关于统一战线问题的发言。民盟对这个发言共讨论了三次。第一、三次会议是黄药眠主持的，第二次会议是吴景超主持的。一、三次会议上，黄药眠作了开会词和总结，第二次会议上作了长篇发言。从三次会议的情况来看，黄药眠是起了主导作用的。在会议进行中，右派分子张云川等人发表了很多反动言论。罗隆基、黄药眠曾一再鼓励他。会后，他们整理出来一百零一条意见。这些“意见”中有：在互相监督的原则下，各民主党派应该纠正以往对共产党阿谀奉迎、报喜不报忧的作风。现在民盟有一套逻辑，就是谁的政治地位高，他们就认为党方看重谁，就是谁有行情，而且立刻就成为他们拉拢团结的对象，于是就该摆在领导地位。“意见”中还恶意地挑拨道：现在还有一种风气：就是如果共产党说一句谁不好，那就成了落水狗，群起而攻之。这是非常庸俗的原则。民主党派中有些自命进步的人，就不准人家提意见，谁如果提意见，不是说你反对共产党，就是说你分庭抗礼，帽子一大堆。
    从这些意见来看，这次会议显然是在右派分子操纵下，一次向党向民盟左派进攻的会议。在这次会议上，黄药眠的反党“天才”为章伯钧、罗隆基所赏识。因此，章伯钧用地位收买了黄药眠。黄药眠也就成为后来决定民盟向右转的主角之一。
    民盟向右转中的角色
    今年4月份民盟召集的民盟全国工作会议。中心议题是讨论确定民盟今后中心工作。这次会议在章罗联盟操纵之下，右派分子占了优势，左派的正确意见被压下去了。黄药眠在整个会议过程中，是右派分子中的极右派。开始的总报告和会议总结，都是黄药眠做的。会议分两个阶段进行，第一阶段讨论毛主席最高国务会议上的讲话。由章、罗亲自指挥，号召“大鸣大放”。第二阶段是讨论四个中心问题。黄药眠是第一组讨论“民盟今后到底作什么”的召集人。领导小组在讨论黄药眠拟定的草案时，对“民盟今后作什么”有很多意见。有人主张盟监督共产党，有人说支持大鸣大放，胡愈之等极少数人主张以文教、思想改造为主。黄药眠坚持应以“加强政治工作为主，支持大鸣大放，监督共产党”。他认为现在知识分子已成为劳动者了，再强调自我改造，提高政治水平，那是消极的表现。他野心勃勃地强调说，所谓“共存”、“监督”事实上也就是政治民主化，当党提出政治民主化的时候，而有人要把民盟的首要任务放在自我改造、文教方面。这样长期共存就要落空。当时胡愈之不同意这种见解，发生了争论，章伯钧见势不妙，只好出来调解。他说现在进行监督还有困难，如人们不习惯，共产党内90％以上反对，我们提也好，不提也好，都不等于不监督。这时黄药眠表示：章副主席这样说法，我才心服。在章伯钧这种两面手法的花招下，把左派的意见压下去了。从此，把民盟引导到向右转的危险道路上去。而黄药眠进一步获得章、罗器重。会后章伯钧亲赴黄药眠家里拜访，提出要他担任民盟中央宣传部长。并说，“做民盟的工作大有前途，民盟部长的地位，相当于省府的副部长”。黄欣然接受，因而黄药眠一下子就爬上了章罗联盟军师这把交椅。
    参谋团中的参谋长
    黄药眠自从担任民盟中央宣传部长以后，积极地向章罗联盟献策。在章罗5月13日召集的民盟文教、宣传、学习委员会部分负责人的座谈会上，黄药眠提出了向党进攻的计谋。他要求动员全盟力量向党进攻。他说，盟中央可抓几个主要问题来进行工作，可选规划、学制等进行座谈，我们也可派人到上海、天津、武汉等大城市收集对党不满的材料，同时还要在北京各高等学校摸摸情况。科学规划要依靠专家，先找盟内专家提意见，并邀请出席全国人民代表大会第四次会议的盟内代表座谈两次。第二个意见，建议搞个争鸣月刊社，批评不用民盟名义，用争鸣社的民间身份出现，这样的批评会自由些。第三个意见，主张民盟中央成立“政策研究委员会”，作为章罗联盟向党进攻的参谋团，由黄担任参谋长。他说，这个委员会是为章罗联盟设计向党进攻的蓝图，还可以为章伯钧准备发言材料和意见，这样章伯钧就不会乱说话。黄药眠向党进攻的三个策略，章罗极为欣赏。后来在章罗联盟操纵下，召开了一次座谈会，决定有计划地从各个方面向党展开猖狂进攻，并立即成立“党委负责制”、“科学规划”、“有职有权”、“监督争鸣”四个工作组。章、罗并任命黄药眠为“党委负责制”工作组的负责人。后来，黄药眠在夺取党对高等学校的领导权方面，成为章罗联盟最有力的能手。
    民主办校幕后人
    当右派分子陶大镛企图夺取师大党的领导的“民主办校”纲领拟定出来后，黄药眠以“党委负责制”工作组负责人的名义，召集了北大的储圣麟，人大的吴景超、侯大乾，农大的陆近仁，师大的陶大镛，进一步讨论高等学校体制问题，会上黄作了总结。为了实现“民主办校”纲领，6月5日在师大中文系教职员座谈会上，黄药眠亲自向党开炮，企图先在师大打开缺口。在会上他用歪曲事实的手法，对党的领导，党的知识分子政策，进行了恶毒的攻击和污蔑。他说做中文系主任是有职无权，拿他当玩具耍。他并认为党对知识分子“团结教育改造”的政策，在北京实际执行的是“利用限制改造”的政策。他还说，你们不要死记列宁的个别词句，像念经一样，一提到知识分子就有“对抗情绪”，总是把知识分子当成异己分子。办学校不是打仗，不能用带兵的办法，它也不是政权机关，不能用法律办事。但我们学校里神秘气十足，什么都保密。又不是炮台、仓库，有什么东西不可以公开呢？教书先生靠知识吃饭，而不是看级别。但我们学校里的评级都是用政治力量来提高学术地位，这是用作官的办法来办学校。学校应以学术为基础。现在有些人为了当助教、讲师，像蚯蚓一样地拼命往党里钻，认为这是升官发财的阶梯。而整个师大党又掌握在娃娃们手里，他们是一无所知的白痴，不仅袒护落后，党内还充满着资产阶级思想。党在腐化了，像资本主义一样从内部产生致命的矛盾。总之，黄药眠的结论是：党是不能领导国家和高等学校的，应由像他这样的知识分子来领导。他摆出一副正人君子的面孔说，国家不是共产党所有的，我们应当对人民负责。接着6月6日他出席章伯钧秘密召集的六教授会议，根据这次会议的精神，又在“民主办校”纲领的基础上，6月10日黄药眠亲自起草，代表章罗联盟完成了“我们对高等学校领导制度的建议”。这时反右派斗争已经开始了，但黄药眠在这个建议草案中，还露骨地提出了篡夺高等学校领导权，还死心踏地的为章罗联盟效劳。甚至当“民主办校”的阴谋在报纸上揭发后，陶大镛找到黄药眠哭着要求他保镖。黄说不要着急，这个事情我负责，不要你负责。在一次民盟的会议上，黄药眠说陶大镛是他派到师大去的。
    披着学者外衣的政客
    北京师范大学广大师生，揭穿了右派分子黄药眠是披着学者外衣的一个不折不扣的政客后，黄药眠装出一副哭丧着的脸，向大家表白自己是一个忠诚勤恳、奉公守法的学者，不承认他是向党进攻的政客，说他的工作从来就是教书第一，写文章第二，民盟工作第三。说他是传授知识的学者，从来不搞政治。这些谎言是掩盖不了事实的。
    右派分子黄药眠反党、反社会主义并不是偶然的，是有历史渊源的。黄药眠参加过党，大革命时被捕，出狱后去延安，党要考查他，他非常仇恨，扬长而去。这次和章罗联盟合谋向党进攻，就是多年来对党仇恨的进一步发展。黄药眠是师大中文系的主任，学校很信任他，很尊重他的职权，但他几年来总闹辞职，对系的工作很少过问，一面却到处喊有职无权。近两年来，黄药眠用在教学上的时间愈来愈少，上课迟到是常事，有时连讲授提纲也拿错了。原来他主要的时间和精力是用在与章、罗勾结，干那些反党反社会主义的勾当上去了。天津师范学院右派分子潘世雄今年来京开教学会议时，黄药眠向他收集知识分子牢骚，并作了指示。师大沈藻翔到山西去进行函授辅导时，黄要他在山西搜集文教界对党和政府不满的材料。黄药眠还坐汽车到清华、北大看大字报、拜访教授收集材料。右派分子陶大镛曾问他为章、罗的事为什么这样卖力，黄药眠毫不隐蔽地说，为了吃民盟的政治饭嘛。黄药眠还有一套巧妙的办法，他教诲陶大镛，要在“外面多活动”，培养对“政治气候”的敏感性；为了取得“学术名声”，在群众中树立“威信”，一定时间要观察“政治气候”，写写官样的文章。同时，为了被人批评时能“立于不败之地”，要熟读马列主义书籍。黄药眠的这套“秘诀”，和他的反共反社会主义言行，证明他是披着学者外衣的政客。
