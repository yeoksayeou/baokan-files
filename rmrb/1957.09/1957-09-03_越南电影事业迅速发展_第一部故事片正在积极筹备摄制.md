Hanoi Dispatch: The "Asian Film Week," which began simultaneously in ten cities in our country on August 31st, will feature three Vietnamese films: "Resisting Drought," "Fragments of Vietnamese People's Lives," and "Spring in the Northwest Highlands."

A responsible comrade from the Vietnam Film Bureau said: The above three films are all documentary shorts. "Resisting Drought" introduces the situation of North Vietnamese farmers coping with the drought in early 1956. Because of its clear theme and timely production, it played a positive role in promoting farmers to conquer natural disasters and strengthen their confidence in "man's ability to conquer nature" at that time, so it was praised by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture. Not long ago, it also won an encouragement award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival held in Czechoslovakia. "Fragments of Vietnamese People's Lives" is compiled from eleven newsreels. In just twenty minutes, it reflects many aspects of the lives of the Vietnamese people after the restoration of peace. Viewers can see "Vietnamese workers working hard under the guidance of Soviet experts who have come from afar to build power plants; organized mountain farmers planting late rice; the port of Haiphong becoming increasingly prosperous; the popular Bao Xia tangerines across the country having a bumper harvest; the literacy movement penetrating into remote rural areas; and the high-quality coal from Hongji Mine being welcomed by foreign buyers..." "Spring in the Northwest Highlands" is the first color documentary film shot by Vietnam itself. It introduces the scenery and people's lives in the northern highlands, the cradle of the Vietnamese revolution.

The Vietnamese film industry, founded in 1950, has co-produced three large-scale documentaries with China, the Soviet Union, and Poland: "Vietnam in the War of Resistance," "Vietnam," and "Bamboo." Since 1953, it has independently produced hundreds of newsreels and dozens of documentaries. At present, Vietnam produces an average of twelve feature and short documentaries and forty-eight issues of "News Briefs" every year; it also dubs and copies some foreign films. The production of the first feature film is actively underway.

In Vietnam, watching movies is a very "popular" form of entertainment. The working people in the cities can spend a hundred yuan (about seven cents in our country) to watch an open-air movie, and various agencies and rural areas often organize free screenings.

    越南电影事业迅速发展
    第一部故事片正在积极筹备摄制
    本报河内讯  8月31日起在我国十大城市同时举行的“亚洲电影周”中，观众将看到三部越南影片：“抗旱”、“越南人民生活的片断”和“越北高原的春天”。
    越南电影局负责同志说：以上三部都是纪录短片，“抗旱”是介绍1956年初北越农民对付旱灾的情形。因主题鲜明、摄制及时，对当时推动农民去征服天灾、加强他们“人定胜天”的信心方面起了积极作用，所以受到越南文化部的表扬。不久以前，在捷克斯洛伐克举行的卡罗维发利国际电影节上，也获得了鼓励奖。“越南人民生活的片断”是由十一部新闻纪录片剪辑成的。它在短短的二十分钟里，反映出越南人民在恢复和平后生活的许多方面。观众从这里可以看到“越南工人在不远千里而来的苏联专家指导下奋力修建发电厂；组织起来的山区农民播种晚稻；海防港口的码头日益繁荣；畅销全国的堡下蜜柑大丰收；识字运动深入到穷乡僻壤，鸿基矿的优质煤受到外国买主的欢迎……。“越北高原的春天”是越南自拍的第一部彩色纪录片，它介绍了越南革命的摇篮北部高原的风物和人民生活。
    1950年创立的越南电影事业，除了同中国、苏联、波兰先后合拍过三部大型纪录片：“抗战的越南”、“越南”和“竹子”外，从1953年起已自拍了上百部新闻短片和几十部纪录片。现在越南每年平均生产长、短纪录片十二部，四十八辑“新闻简报”；另外还配音复制一些外国影片。第一部故事片的制作正在积极筹备中。
    在越南，看电影是一种非常“大众化”的娱乐。城市的劳动人民花上一百块钱（约合我国七分），就可以看上一场露天电影，各机关和农村还经常组织免费放映。
