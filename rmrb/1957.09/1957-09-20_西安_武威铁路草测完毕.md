Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th: The preliminary survey work for the Xi'an-Wuwei Railway has been completed. The surveying and mapping personnel have returned to Lanzhou from the field with a large amount of collected route selection data, preparing to compile a design proposal.

This railway starts from Xi'an, advances westward, passes through the old revolutionary base areas of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and the Guyuan and Wuzhong areas where the Hui people live, and connects with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in Wuwei. It is more than 900 kilometers long and is a trunk line of the Northwest railway network. The Xi'an-Wuwei Railway runs parallel to the western section of the Longhai Railway. After its completion, it can reduce the heavy transportation tasks on the western section of the Longhai Railway and ensure the increasing transportation of materials in the Northwest. In the future, materials transported to North China and Northeast China via the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can also take the western section of the Xi'an-Wuwei Railway and then be transported north via the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, which can shorten the journey by several hundred kilometers compared to detouring through Lanzhou.

　　西安——武威铁路草测完毕
    新华社兰州19日电　西安——武威铁路的草测工作已经完成，勘测人员带着收集好的大量选线资料，从野外回到了兰州，准备编制设计意见书。
    这条铁路从西安西进，经过陕甘宁边区老革命根据地和回族人民聚居的固原、吴忠等地区，在武威跟兰新铁路相衔接，全长九百多公里，是西北铁路网的一条干线。西武铁路和陇海铁路西段并行，建成以后，可以减低陇海路西段过重的运输任务，保证西北愈来愈多的物资运输。将来通过兰新铁路运往华北、东北的物资，也可以借道西武铁路的西段，再经包兰铁路北运，这样比绕道兰州可以少走好几百公里的路。
