　　Speech by Chairman Mao Zedong
　　Your Excellency Vice President, Comrades and Friends:
    We extend a warm welcome to Dr. Radhakrishnan, Vice President of the Republic of India, an outstanding Indian scholar and statesman, and a good friend of the Chinese people, on his friendly visit to our country. We thank him for bringing the profound friendship of the great Indian people to the Chinese people.
    The Chinese and Indian nations have been good friends and good neighbors since ancient times. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by our two countries have given our traditional friendship a new foundation and new development. The people of our two countries are building their own countries and are working for world peace. For these common goals, our two countries are conducting close and friendly cooperation. The unity of the one billion people of China and India is a great force and an important guarantee for peace in Asia and the world.
    A characteristic of our era is the upsurge of national independence movements in Asian and African countries. Colonialists are doing everything possible to reverse this situation. However, as the Egyptian people last year and the Syrian people now have shown to the world, all the conspiracies and provocations of the colonialists will inevitably meet with the most惨重的 defeat. The Chinese people firmly support the struggles of the people of Asian and African countries to win and safeguard national independence.
    The Chinese people have always had great respect for the hardworking and intelligent Indian people. We congratulate the Indian people on every achievement in peaceful construction. We admire the Indian people's outstanding contribution to the cause of international peace. We especially thank India for its just support of China in international affairs. We have no doubt that India will play an increasingly important role in the world.
    I propose,
    To the prosperity of the Republic of India and the happiness of the Indian people,
    To the friendship between the people of China and India,
    To world peace,
    To the health of His Excellency Vice President of the Republic of India, Radhakrishnan,
    To the health of His Excellency President of the Republic of India, Prasad,
    Cheers!

　　毛泽东主席的讲话
　　副总统阁下，同志们、朋友们：
    印度共和国副总统、印度杰出的学者和政治家、中国人民的好朋友拉达克里希南博士来到我国进行友好访问，我们向他表示热烈的欢迎。我们感谢他给中国人民带来了伟大的印度人民的深厚友谊。
    中印两大民族自古以来就是好朋友，好邻居。我们两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则，又使我们的传统友谊有了新的基础，新的发展。我们两国人民都在建设自己的国家，都在为争取世界和平而努力。为了这些共同的目标，我们两国进行着亲密的和友好的合作。中印两国十万万人民团结在一起，是一个伟大的力量，是亚洲和世界和平的重要保证。
    我们这个时代的一个特点是亚非各国民族独立运动的高涨。殖民主义者想尽一切办法企图扭转这个形势。但是，正像去年埃及人民和现在叙利亚人民向全世界所表明的那样，殖民主义者的一切阴谋和挑衅一定会遭到最惨重的失败。中国人民坚决支持亚非各国人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    中国人民历来对勤劳、智慧的印度人民怀着极大的敬意。我们庆贺印度人民在和平建设中的每一个成就。我们敬佩印度人民对于国际和平事业的出色贡献。我们特别感谢印度在国际事务中对中国的正义支持。我们毫不怀疑，印度将在世界上起着越来越重要的作用。
    我提议，
    为印度共和国的繁荣和印度人民的幸福，
    为中印两国人民的友谊，
    为世界和平，
    为印度共和国副总统拉达克里希南阁下的健康，
    为印度共和国总统普拉沙德阁下的健康，
    干杯！
