    Relying on the Masses and Local Forces to Develop Underground Resources
    By our reporter Li Ce
    Relying on the masses and local forces to develop underground resources to expand the country's export goods and industrial raw materials is a new undertaking launched this year in the Ya'an and Xichang Special Zones and the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan. It has developed in accordance with the national industrial construction policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises and building the country through diligence and thrift. The Ya'an and Xichang Special Zones have also formulated a five-year plan for developing underground resources starting in 1958.
    In addition to the large-scale minerals such as iron, asbestos, and mica that are being explored by the central geological departments, these three regions are also quite rich in gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, mica, asbestos, and other minerals. The reserves of these minerals are not large at each site, but they are widely distributed, making them perfectly suitable for exploitation by the masses and local forces. Preliminary exploration confirms that some mines can be mined for ten to twenty years by medium and small-scale operations. Exploiting these minerals requires little investment and yields quick results, enabling the country to obtain exports and exchange them for industrial construction equipment in the short term.
    In Ya'an Special Zone, local people used to mine various exportable minerals. Before liberation, many people panned for gold from the river sand along the Dadu River and Qingyi River. In Hanyuan County, there were more than 3,000 people mining gold in the mountains at most. The highest annual gold production in the entire region was more than 10,000 taels. In recent years, the number of gold miners has gradually disappeared because farmers have joined agricultural cooperatives and are busy with agricultural production. The Tongchanggou copper mine in Tianquan County, the Baitong Jianzi [White Copper Point] in Lushan County, and the Qianjubo and Houjubo copper mines in Yingjing County have a long history of mining. Recent exploration has proved that these copper mines are worth continuing to mine. For example, Baitong Jianzi has at least 1,900 tons of copper and nickel ore. There are more lead-zinc mines in each county, and the Tuanbaoshan lead-zinc mine in Hanyuan County has 250,000 tons, which is a medium-sized mine suitable for local mining. Most of the lead-zinc mines in Yingjing, Baoxing and other counties are "chicken nest mines," with small reserves at each site, but they are easy to mine and of high grade, making them completely suitable for agricultural cooperatives to mine as a sideline. In July this year, two workers from the Yingjing County Iron Plant mined more than a dozen tons in a few days using explosives in Huangnipu.
    The Dadu River General Survey Office of the Central Geological Department, local industrial departments, and the masses have discovered many new mineral deposits, confirming that there are many kinds of minerals in this area. The reserves of lead-zinc ore scattered in a single county amount to several thousand tons. The asbestos mines in Baoxing, Shimian, and other counties are quite rich and can be mined for two to three hundred years under the current production conditions. Technicians from the Dadu River General Survey Team believe that there is no problem in relying on the masses and local forces to develop resources for export goods. The survey team has decided to hand over the information on the medium and small-sized mines they have discovered to the local government in the future and provide the local area with the necessary technical equipment and manpower support.
    Since June, the counties in Ya'an Special Zone have held various meetings with activists who report mineral deposits, experienced gold diggers, agricultural cooperative members, and others to widely publicize the importance of developing underground resources and mobilize the masses to report and mine mineral deposits. They have instructed the industrial departments to assist the masses in the trial production and production of various minerals. This measure not only conforms to the interests of the country and the masses, but also the local people have a traditional experience in mining underground gold, silver, and treasures, which has been enthusiastically endorsed by the masses. Experienced gold diggers in Tianquan, Baoxing, and Lushan counties have found hundreds of old gold shafts with exploitable value. Old farmers who have mined in Shimian County have newly discovered more than 30 mineral deposits. By the end of August, more than 200 people in Hanyuan, Mingshan, Ya'an, and other counties were digging and panning for gold. Agricultural cooperatives in Shimian and Baoxing counties have begun to establish small asbestos mines. In Shimian County, there is an asbestos mine where more than 50 cooperative members are mining every day. The eleven tons of asbestos they produced have been transported to factories in Chongqing. The plan is to produce 100 tons of asbestos this year. Small copper mines and copper smelters have been rapidly established in Lushan, Shimian, and Hanyuan counties. Some counties are testing and producing gold, mica, lead, zinc, and other minerals. The relevant departments in Baoxing County have already purchased lead-zinc ore and antimony ore. The total output value of gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, antimony, and mica produced in the entire region this year will reach more than 2 million yuan.
    The five-year plan for developing underground resources formulated by the Ya'an Special Zone stipulates that starting next year, the total value of production will increase by 72.6% annually. By 1962, the annual production of gold will be 10,500 taels. Specific production targets have also been set for asbestos at 8,000 tons per year, silver at 30 tons per year, and other minerals. The total annual production value can reach more than 50 million yuan. The total investment for the five years is only 5.9 million yuan, and the profits turned over to the state can reach 20 million yuan. This plan fully complies with the principle of spending less money and getting more done.
    The operating principle is to start small and grow bigger, from manual production to semi-mechanization, and from single products to comprehensive utilization. In terms of operating form, small mines are mainly operated by agricultural cooperatives as a sideline. It is estimated that the mines operated by agricultural cooperatives or the masses account for about 92% of all mines. Secondly, medium-sized mines are run by local state-owned enterprises. Third, local areas and agricultural cooperatives jointly operate them, with the state responsible for purchasing and smelting, and the agricultural cooperatives responsible for mining. Finally, there are household sideline businesses, such as panning and digging for gold. When determining the above policies, various ideas that were divorced from reality, such as greed for large-scale operations, newness, and modernization, were criticized.
    The total agricultural output value of Ya'an Special Zone last year was more than 40 million yuan, and the industrial output value of the special zone and counties was only more than 10 million yuan. After the implementation of the five-year plan for developing underground resources, the industrial output value of the entire region will greatly exceed the increase in agricultural production. Most of the mineral deposits in the Xichang Special Zone are scattered in relatively poor mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas. Therefore, the comrades in these areas have a strong interest in developing underground resources and firmly believe that after five years, the economic lives of the people in the entire region will be completely renewed, which will have a positive effect on consolidating agricultural cooperation and strengthening unity among the local ethnic groups.

    依靠群众和地方力量开发地下资源
    本报记者　李策
    依靠群众和地方力量开发地下资源，为国家扩大出口物资和工业原料，是四川雅安、西昌两专区和甘孜藏族自治州今年举办的一项新兴事业。它是遵照国家工业建设大中小相结合和勤俭建国的方针发展起来的。雅安和西昌两专区并且制定了从1958年开始的开发地下资源的五年规划。
    这三个地区除了中央地质部门重点勘探的铁、石棉、云母等大型矿产外，各地蕴藏的金、银、铜、铅、锌、云母、石棉等矿产也相当丰富。这些矿产每处蕴藏量不多，但是散布较广，完全适合依靠群众和地方力量进行开采。初步勘探证实，有些矿可供中、小型开采十年到二十年。开采这些矿产投资小，收效快，短期内就能够供给国家出口，换来工业建设的设备。
    雅安专区各种适于出口的矿产，过去当地群众就进行开采。解放前，沿大渡河、青衣江两岸，有很多人从河沙里淘金。在汉源县山里挖金矿的群众最多的有三千多人。全区黄金最高年产量有一万多两。最近几年，因为农民加入农业社，忙于农业生产等原因，采金子的逐渐绝迹。天全县铜场沟、芦山县白铜尖子、荥经县的前聚坝和后聚坝的铜矿，开采的历史较久。最近勘探证明，这些铜矿有继续开采的价值。例如白铜尖子至少还有铜、镍矿一千九百吨。各县铅锌矿较多，汉源县团宝山铅锌矿有二十五万吨，是个适于地方开采的中型矿。在荥经、宝兴等县的铅锌矿多半是“鸡窠矿”，每处蕴量不多，但是开采方便，品位较高，完全适于农业社作为副业进行开采。今年7月，荥经县铁厂两个工人在黄泥堡用爆炸法，几天功夫开采了十几吨。
    中央地质部大渡河普查处、地方工业部门和群众又发现了许多新的矿点，证实这一带地区各种矿产是很多的。单是分散在一个县内的铅锌矿蕴藏量就有几千吨。宝兴、石棉等县的石棉矿相当丰富，按照现在的生产条件，可以开采两三百年。大渡河普查队技术人员认为，依靠群众和地方力量开发出口物资的资源是不成问题的。这个普查队确定，今后把自己发现的中、小型矿产资料交给当地政府，并给地方上以必要的技术设备和人力的支援。
    雅安专区各县从6月份起，分别召开群众报矿积极分子、挖金老手、农业社员等各种会议，广泛宣传开发地下资源的重要意义，发动群众报矿、采矿；责成工业部门协助群众进行各种矿产的试制和生产。这项措施不仅符合国家和群众的利益，而且当地群众历来就有开采地下金银财宝的传统和经验，从而受到群众热烈赞同。天全、宝兴、芦山三县的挖金老手们找到成百个有开采价值的旧金硐子。石棉县采过矿的老农民们新发现三十几个矿点。到8月底，汉源、名山、雅安等县已经有两百多人挖、淘金子。石棉、宝兴两县的农业社开始建立小型石棉矿。石棉县有座石棉矿每天有五十多个社员在采矿。他们生产的十一吨石棉已经运到了重庆的工厂。今年计划生产一百吨石棉。小型铜矿、炼铜厂分别在芦山、石棉、汉源三县迅速地建立起来。有些县正分别试制、生产黄金、云母、铅、锌等。宝兴县有关部门已经收购了铅锌矿石，锑矿石。今年全区出产的黄金、银、铜、铅、锌、锑以及云母的总产值将达到两百多万元 。
    雅安专区制定的开发地下资源的五年规划中规定，从明年开始，以后每年生产总值要求递增72.6％。到1962年，年产黄金一万零五百两。年产石棉八千吨，银三十吨，其他矿产也订出具体生产指标。全年生产总值可以达到五千多万元。五年全部投资只有五百九十万元，给国家的上缴利润可以达到两千万元，这项规划完全符合少花钱，多办事的方针。
    经营方针是从小到大，从手工生产到半机械化，从单一产品到综合利用。经营形式，小型矿主要是由农业社作为副业经营，估计农业社或群众经营的矿产约占全部矿产的92％；其次，中型矿由地方国营；第三是地方和农业社合营，由国家负责收购、冶炼，由农业社负责采矿；最后是家庭副业，如掏、挖金子等。在确定上述方针的时候，批判了各种贪大，贪新，贪现代化等脱离实际的思想。
    雅安专区去年农业生产总值是四千多万元，专县工业只有一千多万元。实现开发地下资源五年规划之后，全区工业产值将大大超过农业增产的幅度。西昌专区的矿产多半分散在比较贫苦的山区和少数民族地区。因此，这些地区的同志对开发地下资源有着浓厚的兴趣，坚信五年之后，全区人民经济生活的面貌必定焕然一新，这对于巩固农业合作化，加强当地各民族之间的团结，都会发生良好的作用。
