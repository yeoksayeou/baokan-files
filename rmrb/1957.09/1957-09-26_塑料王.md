    "Plastic King"
    According to the Liberation Daily: The "Plastic King" - polytetrafluoroethylene, which used to rely on foreign imports, has recently been successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Public-Private Joint-Operated Hongyuan Chemical Factory.
    Polytetrafluoroethylene plastic is made from the special products of East China - fluorite and sulfuric acid, after complex chemical treatment. It has high corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance, and high mechanical properties (high hardness). It can be used to manufacture acid-resistant pump pipelines and chemical machinery. It can also replace steel and various alloys to manufacture cylinders, auto parts, and sturdy and wear-resistant gears, "steel pipes," springs and various mechanical parts for industrial purposes. The hardness of this plastic is even higher than platinum, and it is the hardest plastic. It will not deform under high temperatures caused by severe friction, so it is called "Plastic King". It is needed to manufacture the outer shell of icebreakers, jet planes, missiles, etc.

    “塑料王”
    据解放日报消息：过去一向依靠国外进口的“塑料王”——聚四氟乙烯，最近由上海市公私合营鸿沅化学厂初步试制成功。
    聚四氟乙烯塑料是采用华东地区的特产——萤石和硫酸为原料，经过复杂的化学处理后制成的。它有高度耐腐蚀、耐高温的特性和高度机械性（硬度高），可以制造耐酸泵管道和化工机械，还可以代替钢材、多种合金制造汽缸、汽车零件和工业方面坚固耐磨的齿轮、“钢管”、弹簧等各种机械零件。这种塑料的硬度比白金还高，是塑料中硬度最高的一种，在剧烈摩擦而发生高温的条件下不会变形，因此被称为“塑料王”。制造破冰船头部外壳、喷气飞机、导弹等，都需要这种材料。
