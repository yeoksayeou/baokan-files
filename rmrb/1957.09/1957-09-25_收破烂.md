    The heads of the Rightists, in order to contend with the Party for control of the country, are netting "talents" everywhere. They each have their own standards.

    Zhang Bojun instructed his lackeys to develop members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party among backward elements and those with problems; Liu Wang Liming organized a women's army in Chengdu, calling it a "reform-through-labor brigade"; Wu Zuguang's "small family" stipulated that the recruitment of members must have "political standards," such as dissatisfaction with the Party. Members of the "small family" usually addressed each other as brothers, only calling each other "comrade" when they "made mistakes," saying "Comrade, you have really progressed" was a sarcasm for those who "made mistakes."

    In short, the heads of the Rightists are collecting all the political scrap in society. Counter-revolutionaries, murderers, labor camp inmates, comprador politicians, anti-Party elements, and all kinds of careerists are all "talents" in their eyes, all their brothers. Imagine, if the Rightists were to succeed and seize power, and let these "talents" display their abilities: murderers would murder, arsonists would set fires, traitors would betray the country... what a grotesque country our country would become? In what kind of situation would our six hundred million people live?

    收破烂
    天马
    右派头目们为了和党争天下，到处在网罗“人才”。他们各有各的标准。
    章伯钧指示他的喽啰，要在落后分子和有问题的人中去发展农工民主党党员；刘王立明在成都组织了一支娘子军，自称是个“劳改大队”；吴祖光“小家族”规定吸收成员要有“政治标准”，如对党不满等。“小家族”成员平时称兄道弟，“犯了错误”才叫“同志”，说“同志，你真进步”是对“犯错误者”的讽刺。
    总之，右派头目们是在收罗社会上的一切政治破烂。反革命分子、杀人凶犯、劳改队员、洋奴政客、反党分子、各式各样的野心家等等，都是他们心目中的“人才”，都是他们的哥弟。设想一下，若右派分子得志，掌握了政权，把这些“人才”的本事使出来：杀人的杀人，放火的放火，卖国的卖国……那我们的国家将会变成一个怎样的奇形怪状的国家？我们六亿人民将会生活在怎样的一种境遇之中？
