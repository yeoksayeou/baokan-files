    (Report from Liaoning Daily) Since liberation, the Liaoning area has newly built, expanded, and renovated 520 factories and mines, and restored and constructed 805 kilometers of railways and 2,579 kilometers of highways. In 1956, the total industrial output value of Liaoning Province increased by 1.8 times compared with the highest year during the puppet Manchukuo period (1943), and increased by 7.3 times compared with 1949.
    From the "September 18th" Incident in 1931 to the Japanese surrender, in the fourteen years, Japanese imperialism, in order to plunder resources, established in Liaoning Province some colonial raw material industries, munitions industries, and repair industries that served its own domestic industry. After the Japanese surrender, these industrial foundations were severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandits, and almost all production stopped before liberation in 1948. The number of workers decreased from 600,000 in 1943 to 50,000. The total industrial output value only accounted for about 5% of that in 1943. Only one of the province's twenty-two steelmaking furnaces was restored in 1947. In the early days of liberation in 1949, although we vigorously restored it, the total industrial output value still decreased by 70% compared with the highest production level of the puppet Manchukuo in 1943.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and through the efforts of all staff and workers, it took only three years to restore the war-torn industrial base. By 1952, both industrial and agricultural production had exceeded the highest level of the puppet Manchukuo. Taking 1943 as 100, the total industrial output value in 1952 was 120.7%. By 1956, the highest production level of the puppet Manchukuo in 1943 had been left far behind. From the perspective of development speed, the total industrial output value of the puppet Manchukuo increased by 3.3 times in fourteen years, with an average annual growth rate of 10.9%; the total industrial output value increased by 7.3 times in the eight years since the founding of the country, with an average annual growth rate of 30.3%. From the perspective of production level, the production level in 1956 increased by 1.8 times compared with the total industrial output value in 1943. Among them: steel increased by 211.5% compared with 1943, coal increased by 30.1%, and cotton yarn increased by 92%.
    The past colonial industries have been completely transformed into socialist industries. The consumer goods industry has also developed greatly. Compared with 1949, the output value of heavy industry increased by 12.5 times in 1956, and the output value of consumer goods industry also increased by three times. What accompanies the development of industrial and agricultural production is no longer exploitation and poverty, but the people's increasing prosperity and happiness.

    八年间新建和改建厂矿五百多个
    辽宁工业产值增长七倍多
    本报讯　据辽宁日报报道：辽宁地区在解放以后，共新建、扩建和改建了五百二十个工厂和矿山，还恢复和建设了八百零五公里铁路和二千五百七十九公里公路。1956年，辽宁省工业总产值比伪满时期最高一年（1943年）增长了一点八倍；比1949年增长了七点三倍。
    自1931年“九一八”事变开始，到日本投降的十四年中，日本帝国主义为掠夺资源，曾在辽宁省建立一些为其本国工业服务的殖民地性质的原料工业、军火工业和修配工业。日本投降后，这些工业基础遭到了国民党匪帮的严重破坏，1948年解放前，几乎全部停止生产。工人数目由1943年的六十万人减少到五万人。工业总产值约计只能有1943年的5％。全省二十二座炼钢炉只有1947年时恢复一座。解放初期的1949年，虽经我们大力恢复，但与伪满生产水平最高的1943年比较，工业总产值仍下降70％。
    解放后，在党和人民政府的领导下，经全体职工的努力，只用三年的时间，满目疮痍的工业基础就恢复起来了。到1952年，工农业生产就均已超过了伪满的最高水平。以1943年为一百，1952年的工业总产值已为120.7％。到1956年，更把1943年的伪满最高生产水平远远抛到后边去了。从发展速度上看，伪满十四年工业总产值增长了三点三倍，每年平均增长速度是10.9％；建国八年工业总产值增长了七点三倍，每年平均增长速度是30.3％。从生产水平上看，1956年的生产水平比1943年工业总产值增长了一点八倍。其中计：钢比1943年增长了211.5％，煤增长了30.1％，棉纱增长了92％。
    过去的殖民地性质的工业，已经被彻底改造为社会主义性质的工业。消费品工业也有了很大发展。1956年与1949年相比，重工业产值增加了十二点五倍，消费品工业产值也增加了三倍。伴随着工业农业生产的发展而来的，再不是剥削和贫困，而是人民的日趋富裕和幸福。
