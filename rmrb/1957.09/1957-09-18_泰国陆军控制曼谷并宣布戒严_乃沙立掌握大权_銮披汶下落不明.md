Xinhua News Agency, September 17th, Bangkok Dispatch: Thai army troops entered the capital Bangkok on the evening of September 16th and took control of the entire city. Army radio subsequently broadcast a public announcement by Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Sarit Thanarat regarding the takeover of important targets within the city. The army authorities announced a martial law order on the 17th.

The King of Thailand issued an order on the morning of the 17th, announcing the appointment of Sarit Thanarat as the military commander of the Bangkok area. The order stated that Sarit had obtained power. The order also instructed all officials to obey Sarit's command from now on.

Thai army tanks and truck convoys entered Bangkok late on the 16th. Army troops quickly surrounded the Government House, guarded important thoroughfares, and took over agencies such as the police局, the post office, and the telephone bureau. The army's actions met with no resistance.

It was announced that the army authorities had ordered Major General Khun Pichai Montri to serve as acting police director-general, taking over Nai Phao's command of the police.

The whereabouts of Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram are unknown. Army radio repeatedly broadcast on the morning of the 17th, requesting Pibul to report to army headquarters.

Prior to this, Sarit had led 57 army generals to meet with Pibul during the day on the 16th, again demanding the cabinet's resignation en masse, a demand that Pibul did not agree to.

Sarit was originally the Minister of Defense in Pibul's cabinet. He resigned from this position in August after Pibul requested cabinet ministers to withdraw from commercial activities. He said that one of the reasons he resigned as Minister of Defense was that the government's policies differed from those he advocated. At that time, four other army generals resigned from the cabinet with him. Subsequently, he and 45 second-category members of the Thai parliament appointed by the King withdrew from the ruling Seri Manangkhasila Party on September 10th, followed by 15 second-category members on September 11th. Most of these resigning parliament members were army generals. At the same time, Sarit also put forward the demand for the cabinet's resignation en masse.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th, Bangkok Dispatch: Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Sarit Thanarat, who launched the coup d'état on the evening of the 16th, said at a press conference today that a new government would be established immediately after the situation calmed down. The current parliament will be dissolved on the 19th, and new elections will be held.

Sarit stated at the press conference that Thailand would continue to receive US military assistance in accordance with the agreement concluded with the United States.

The whereabouts of Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram remain unknown. According to Western news agencies, one account says that after leaving Bangkok, Pibul has gone to the Sattahip naval base commanded by his son, while another rumor says that he has gone to the Cambodian or Malayan border.

Former police director-general Nai Phao, whose command has been taken over, was ordered to leave Thailand this afternoon, and reports say he will go to London.

    泰国国王在17日早上发布命令，宣布任命乃沙立为曼谷地区军事司令。命令说，乃沙立已经取得了权力。命令还要所有官员今后听从乃沙立的指挥。
    泰国陆军的坦克和运输部队的卡车是在16日深夜开入曼谷市内的。陆军部队迅速包围了政府大厦，把守着各重要通道，并且接管了警察局、邮政局和电话局等机关。陆军的行动没有遭遇抵抗。

    在这以前，乃沙立曾在16日日间率领五十七名陆军将领会见銮披汶，再次要求内阁总辞职，銮披汶没有答应这一要求。
    乃沙立原来是銮披汶内阁的国防部长，他在銮披汶要求内阁部长退出商业活动以后于8月间辞去这一职务。他说，他辞去国防部长职的一个原因是政府的政策同他所主张的不同。当时还有四个陆军将领同他一起退出内阁。随后，他同四十五名泰国议会中由国王委任的第二类议员一起在9月10日退出执政党马兰卡西拉自由党，接着有十五名第二类议员在9月11日也宣布退出这个党。这些退党的议员多数是陆军将领。乃沙立同时并且提出了要内阁总辞职的要求。
    新华社17日讯　曼谷消息：在16日晚间发动政变的泰国陆军总司令乃沙立今天在记者招待会上说，在局势平静以后，新政府将立即成立。目前的议会将在19日解散，并且将重新举行选举。
    乃沙立在记者招待会上表示，泰国将根据同美国缔结的协定，继续接受美国的军事援助。
    泰国总理銮披汶的下落仍然不明。据西方通讯社报道，一说銮披汶在离开曼谷以后，已经前往由他的儿子担任司令官的梭桃邑海军基地，另外传闻说他已经前往柬埔寨或者马来亚边境。
    被接收指挥权的前警察总监乃炮已经在今天下午被命令离开泰国，有消息说，他将前往伦敦。
