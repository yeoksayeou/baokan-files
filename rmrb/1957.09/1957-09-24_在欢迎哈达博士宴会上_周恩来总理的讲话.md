Esteemed Dr. Mohammed Hatta,
Ladies and Gentlemen!

We are very pleased to warmly welcome Dr. Mohammed Hatta, the famous politician and economist of the Republic of Indonesia, and his wife to visit our country.

Two years ago, when I was invited to visit the Republic of Indonesia after attending the Asian-African Conference, I had a pleasant meeting with Dr. Hatta. I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet Dr. Hatta again in our capital.

As early as his youth, Dr. Hatta participated in the anti-colonial movement and fought for a long time for the independence and freedom of his motherland. In August 1945, he and President Sukarno signed the "Declaration of Independence," announcing the independence of Indonesia and the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia. Recently, the two of them issued a joint statement expressing their determination to safeguard the unity and independence of the country together with all the Indonesian people. These are extremely important events in the history of the Indonesian people.

The independence of Indonesia is one of the major achievements of the anti-colonialist struggle in the modern Asian-African region. Today, the anti-colonialist movement in Asia and Africa has risen to an unprecedented height, and more and more Asian and African people have achieved national independence and freedom. The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 fully embodied the firm will and abundant strength of the Asian and African people to oppose colonialism and strive for and safeguard national independence. The resolutions of the Bandung Conference aroused great repercussions all over the world and played a significant role in easing international tensions. This change in the situation in Asia and Africa has been welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world, but it has been cursed by the colonialists. Unwilling to accept their defeat, they have launched new offensives against the Asian and African people in the past year through armed aggression and subversion. They particularly hope to use the differences between Asian and African countries and the internal discords within each country to realize their ambitions. Faced with this situation, the people of Asian and African countries are increasingly deeply aware that only by further strengthening internal unity and further promoting the Bandung spirit, consolidating and developing friendly cooperation with each other, can they more effectively safeguard their respective independence and more powerfully defend peace in the Asian-African region.

Dr. Hatta has made important contributions to the development of relations between China and Indonesia. In 1950, it was during Dr. Hatta's tenure as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, two newly emerging Asian neighbors, established diplomatic relations. The traditional friendly relations between the two peoples have since entered a new stage. Our two governments and peoples have been continuously working hard to develop our relations and cooperation in international affairs, economy, culture and other fields in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. In recent years, frequent and friendly contacts between leaders and politicians of the two countries have further deepened mutual understanding and trust. We are convinced that Dr. Hatta's visit to our country this time will help to further strengthen the friendship between the people of the two countries.

Dr. Hatta, we hope that you and all the distinguished Indonesian guests who have come with you will have a pleasant tour of our country. Wherever you go, you will receive the sincere and warm welcome of the Chinese people.

I propose:

To the health of His Excellency Dr. Hatta and his wife, and all the distinguished Indonesian guests,
To the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people,
To the friendly unity of the people of Asian and African countries,
To world peace,
To the health of His Excellency President Sukarno!

    在欢迎哈达博士宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    尊敬的穆罕默德·哈达博士阁下：
    女士们，先生们！
    我们怀着十分愉快的心情，热烈地欢迎印度尼西亚共和国著名的政治家和经济学家穆罕默德·哈达博士和他的夫人来我国访问。
    两年以前，我在参加亚非会议以后应邀访问印度尼西亚共和国的时候，曾经和哈达博士有过愉快的会晤。现在我有机会在我国的首都和哈达博士重新会面，感到非常高兴。
    哈达博士早在青年时代就参加了反殖民主义的运动，为了争取祖国的独立和自由进行过长期的奋斗。1945年8月，他同苏加诺总统阁下一起签署了“独立宣言”，宣布了印度尼西亚的独立和印度尼西亚共和国的成立。最近，他们两位又发表了共同声明，表示决心同全体印度尼西亚人民一起维护国家的统一和独立。这些都是印度尼西亚人民历史中极其重要的事件。
    印度尼西亚的独立是现代亚非地区反殖民主义斗争的重大成就之一。今天，亚非两洲的反殖民主义运动已经空前高涨，越来越多的亚非人民取得了民族独立和自由。1955年4月在万隆举行的亚非会议充分地体现了亚非各国人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的坚强意志和充沛力量。万隆会议的决议在世界各地引起了巨大的反响，对于和缓国际紧张局势起了重大的作用。亚非局势的这种变化受到了全世界爱好和平的人民的欢迎，但是却受到殖民主义者们的诅咒。他们不甘心于自己的失败，近一年来不断地用武装侵略和颠覆活动等方式向亚非人民发动新的进攻。他们特别希望利用亚非国家之间的分歧和各国内部的不和，来实现他们的野心。面对着这种情况，亚非各国人民日益深刻地认识到只有更加加强各国内部的团结，并且进一步发扬万隆精神，巩固和发展相互之间的友好合作，才能够更有效地维护各自的独立，才能够更有力地保卫亚非地区的和平。
    哈达博士对于中国和印度尼西亚两国关系的开展曾经作出了重要的贡献。1950年，正是哈达博士担任总理兼外交部长的期间，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国两个新生的亚洲邻邦建立了外交关系。两国人民的传统的友好关系从此进入了一个新的阶段。我们两国政府和人民一直在不断努力，按照和平共处五项原则和万隆决议的十项原则，从国际事务、经济、文化等各个方面来发展我们两国之间的联系和合作。近几年来，两国领导人员和政治家的频繁和友好的接触更加加深了两国之间的了解和信任。我们深信，哈达博士这一次来我国访问必将有助于进一步加强两国人民之间的友谊。
    哈达博士，我们希望你和同来的全体印度尼西亚贵宾们能够在我国各地愉快地参观游览。你们无论到什么地方都将受到中国人民的真诚的和热情的欢迎。
    我建议：
    为哈达博士阁下和他的夫人以及全体印度尼西亚贵宾们的健康，
    为中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的兄弟友谊，
    为亚非各国人民的友好团结，
    为世界和平，
    为苏加诺总统阁下的健康干杯！
