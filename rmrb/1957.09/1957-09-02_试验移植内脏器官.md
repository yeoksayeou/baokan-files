Experiments in Transplanting Internal Organs

The Organ Transplantation Laboratory of the Surgical Teaching and Research Group of the First Moscow Sechenov Medical Institute, under the leadership of Dimitriev, has recently conducted interesting experiments in transplanting internal organs. They used dogs for these experiments.

The experiments proved that a second supplementary heart transplanted into a dog could bear part of the responsibility for maintaining blood circulation. This greatly reduced the activity of the animal's original heart. Dogs with new hearts and lungs responded normally to their surroundings and could drink and eat as usual. Although it was a very heavy operation, the experimental animals tolerated it well. At present, their survival time does not exceed six days and nights. Dogs with two hearts can live for twelve to eighteen days or more; one dog lived for thirty-two days.

The laboratory conducted experiments on two dogs using cross-circulation of different types of blood. Blood circulation was performed by suturing the femoral arteries of the two animals. In this way, the differences in blood composition gradually disappeared. The first batch of experimental animals using cross-circulation lived for ten days. Experiments were also conducted on dogs and human cadavers to improve the surgical treatment of coronary arteriosclerosis by directly joining the internal mammary artery to the coronary artery. The experiments proved that this operation is reliable and worthy of further research, as it can restore blood circulation in the event of arteriosclerosis.

Research on the transplantation of internal organs will play a significant role in the development of surgical experiments and will provide valuable conditions for maintaining people's physical and mental health. (Xu Zisen)

    试验移植内脏器官
    莫斯科谢琴诺夫第一医学院外科手术教研组器官移植实验室，在季米和夫的领导下，最近进行了有趣的移植内脏器官的试验。他们是拿狗来作这一试验的。
    试验证明，移植到狗身上的第二颗补充心脏能够负担起一部分维持血液循环的责任。这就大大地减轻了动物原有的心脏活动。换上新的心脏和肺部的狗，对周围的事物都有正常的反应，可以照常饮水、吃东西。这虽然是一件很繁重的手术，但是受试验的动物都能很好地忍受住。目前它们的生命持久性还不超过六昼夜。带着两颗心脏的狗可以活十二到十八天或更多一些，其中有一只狗活了三十二天。
    实验室在两只狗身上进行了用不同类型血液的交差血液循环的试验。血液循环是用两个动物的股动脉缝接法来进行的。这样，血液成分的差别会渐渐消失。第一批用交差血液循环的试验动物活了十天。用内胸动脉直接和冠状动脉接合来改进冠状血管硬化的外科治疗法，也在狗和人的尸体内进行了试验。试验证明，这种手术是可靠的，大有研究的必要。因为这可以使在动脉硬化时恢复血液循环。
    内脏器官移植研究工作，在外科实验发展上将起重大作用，并将为保持人们身心健康提供极有价值的条件。 （许子森）
