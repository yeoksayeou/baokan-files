    Master and Apprentice
    Zhang Riliang, an old lathe operator and Communist Party member in the Mechanical Workshop of the Dalian Shipyard, has trained twelve apprentices. Some are now chief foreman or workshop leaders, and some have reached technical levels six or seven. This respected 44-year-old master worker has thirty years of experience. At the age of fourteen, he worked as an apprentice in a private iron factory. During his apprenticeship, he had to empty chamber pots for the boss, look after the boss's wife's children, and cook meals. He would be beaten and scolded if he didn't do things to their satisfaction. At that time, the master was unwilling to teach his skills to his apprentice, because he was afraid that if the apprentice learned the skills, he would be out of a job. After liberation, he not only patiently passed on his technical experience to his apprentices, but also used his painful experiences in the old society to educate young apprentices and improve their ideological awareness.

    师傅和徒弟
    大连造船厂机械车间的老车工、共产党员张日良，已培养了十二个徒弟。现在有的已当了总工长、工段长，有的技术水平达到了六、七级。这位四十四岁受人尊敬的老师傅，已有三十年工龄。他十四岁时就在一家私人铁工厂当学徒，在学徒期间，给老板端尿盆、替老板娘看孩子、做饭，一不称心就要挨打挨骂。那时师傅不愿意把技术教给徒弟，因为怕教会了徒弟，自己就没有饭吃。解放以后，他不仅把自己的技术经验耐心地传授给他的徒弟，并且用他在旧社会里的痛苦经历，教育青年徒工，提高他们的思想觉悟。
