　　Say What You Have to Say, Present the Facts and Reason Things Out
　　The Shanghai Rectification Campaign Is Being Conducted Extensively and Deeply

    This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shanghai on the 18th: The mass rectification campaign in Shanghai has unfolded with great momentum. According to statistics, nearly a thousand organizations, factories, enterprises, and schools have recently put up over a million big-character posters and held countless large and small forums. This is another upsurge of great airing of views and great debate following the Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.
    This mass rectification campaign is more extensive and deeper than the previous period. Currently, 564 units have fully launched the airing of views, and nearly 150,000 employees and staff members have enthusiastically joined this movement. The 32 state-owned and joint state-private factories that began the rectification campaign in the first batch have developed the movement particularly rapidly; Shanghai Shipyard, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, and six other factories alone have put forward more than 58,000 opinions. These opinions are generally very specific, reflecting the frankness and enthusiasm of the employees for the rectification campaign. Soon, more than 17,000 factories throughout the city will also universally carry out rectification and socialist education movements in batches and phases.
    In the suburban rural areas, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is holding a three-level cadre meeting to make arrangements for the rectification campaign that will be gradually launched among 400,000 farmers.
    The rectification campaign of the local organizations of the Shanghai democratic parties, centered on the struggle against the rightists, will also be universally carried out among more than 13,000 members throughout the city. The rectification campaign of 200,000 industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai, centered on destroying capitalism and establishing socialism, is being actively planned; more than 6,000 key members of the industrial and commercial circles at the municipal level who are participating in the rectification campaign have already reported to the rectification leading body and will be concentrated in the Municipal Industrial and Commercial Political School for rectification.
    Institutions of higher learning have now set off a more extensive new wave of great airing of views and great debate. Many students who have returned from off-campus production internships and new students this semester have also joined the torrent of airing of views. Twenty-four cultural and educational units are also airing their views again on the basis of past airing of views, demanding that the airing be deep and thorough.
    Speaking freely and giving full play to free thought are the salient features of this rectification campaign. People have various opportunities to express their opinions through various forms. The originally quiet office buildings can now be seen after work with people in groups of three or five, discussing and commenting. Some retired workers, or employees on business trips in other places, have recently rushed back to their original units to speak their minds. And big-character posters, the most rapid and convenient form of expressing opinions, have become a tool loved by people. Whether it is in organs, factories, or schools, thousands of big-character posters are posted everywhere. In the First Commercial Bureau system alone, more than 30,000 posters have been put up. Corridors, walls, and cafeteria stairwells are covered with a dazzling array of posters. Some factories have also specially built tall reed sheds to allow everyone to post big-character posters here. These colorful big-character posters, signed or unsigned, expose the specific facts of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism existing in the units. Some also put forward specific suggestions, and some even launched discussions on a certain issue. The forms of big-character posters are even more diverse. Some write allegro poems, some draw cartoons, some combine narration and discussion, comment and description, and some are sharp and satirical short essays. In addition, there are poems, lyrics, songs, couplets, dictionaries, crosstalks, doggerels, chapter novels, and all kinds of forms.
    With the unfolding of the great airing of views, great debates have also unfolded. Big-character posters and debates, written battles and oral battles, are enthusiastically intertwined.
    The debate is conducted peacefully by presenting facts and reasoning things out. In units where debates were launched earlier, certain arguments have already reached a consensus among the masses. When the Shanghai Post Office employees debated whether the living conditions and treatment before liberation were better or the living conditions and treatment after liberation were better, the two sides were divided into two groups, separately visiting old workers and consulting the price index before liberation in the library, collecting information from various sources. In addition to holding group discussions, they also held two large debates one after another. As a result of the debate, those who originally insisted that the treatment before liberation was better abandoned their views in the face of the facts.
    Leaders of various units, while encouraging the masses to carry out debates, continue to sincerely accept criticism. Many Communist Party leading cadres in organs now often take the initiative to talk to non-Party cadres or use their spare time and holidays to visit their homes for casual conversation, which is generally welcomed. The improvement working groups established in various units during the rectification campaign are still working actively, and many problems that can be solved have already been addressed. For example, in the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau, more than 80% of the problems raised by employees that need to be studied and resolved have now been resolved.

### 有什么说什么　摆事实讲道理  上海整风运动广泛深入开展

　　有什么说什么　摆事实讲道理
　　上海整风运动广泛深入开展
    本报上海18日电　上海市全民性的整风运动已经波澜壮阔地展开了。据统计，近千个机关、工厂、企业、学校，最近已经贴出了上百万张大字报，举行了无数次大型或小型的座谈会。这是继上海市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议以后，又一次掀起了大鸣大放的热潮。
    这个全民性的整风运动较前一时期发展得更广更深。现在已经有五百六十四个单位全面展开了鸣放，有近十五万职工和工作人员热烈投入这一运动。第一批进行整风的三十二家国营和公私合营工厂，运动开展得特别迅速；仅上海船厂、国棉一厂等八个厂就已提出了五万八千多条意见，这些意见一般都提得很具体，反映了职工对整风运动的坦率和热情。不久，全市一万七千多个工厂也将普遍地分批分期地进行整风和开展社会主义教育运动。
    郊区农村方面，中共上海市委正在召开三级干部会议，对即将在四十万农民中逐步展开的整风运动作了部署。
    以反右派斗争为中心的上海各民主党派地方组织的整风运动，也将在全市一万三千多成员中普遍进行。以破资本主义、立社会主义为中心的上海市二十万工商业者的整风，正在积极酝酿；参加市级整风的六千余工商界骨干已经向整风领导机构报到，他们将集中在市工商界政治学校进行整风。
    高等学校现在已经掀起了更为广泛的又一次大鸣大放，许多在校外生产实习归来的同学和本学期的新生也都投入了鸣放的洪流。有二十四个文教单位也在过去鸣放的基础上再度鸣放，要求放得深放得透。
    畅所欲言，充分发挥自由思想，是这次整风运动的显著特点。人们有着各种机会，通过各式各样的形式来表达自己的意见。原来肃静的办公大楼，现在下班后还可以看到人们三五成群，议论纷纷。有些已退休的工人，或出差在外埠的职工，近来也都赶回原单位，讲出自己的心里话。而大字报，这一表达意见最迅速、方便的形式，更成为人们所喜爱的工具。不论是机关、工厂还是学校，到处都张贴了数以千百计的大字报。仅仅第一商业局系统，就贴出了三万多张。走廊、墙壁、饭堂楼梯口，到处张贴的琳琅满目。有的工厂还特地搭起高大的芦席棚，让大家在这里张贴大字报。这些五颜六色，署名或不署名的大字报，揭发了单位中所存在的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的具体事实，有些还提出了具体的建议，有的还就某一问题展开了讨论。大字报的形式更是丰富多采，有的写上快板诗，有的画了漫画，有的夹叙夹议、有评有述，有的就是一篇又尖锐又辛辣的小品文。此外，还有诗词歌赋、对联、辞典、相声、顺口溜、章回小说，各种形式应有尽有。
    随着大鸣大放展开了大争大辩。大字报和辩论会，笔战和舌战，热烈地交织成一片。
    辩论是用摆事实、讲道理的方法，心平气和地进行的。开展辩论比较早的单位，某些论点已经在群众中取得了一致的意见。上海邮局职工对解放前生活待遇好还是解放后生活待遇好的问题展开辩论时，双方分成两个组，分头访问老工人，到图书馆查阅解放前的物价指数，多方收集资料。他们除了举行小组辩论以外，还先后举行了两次大辩论会。争辩结果，原来坚持解放前待遇好的人，在事实面前放弃了自己的见解。
    各单位的领导人一面鼓励群众开展辩论，一面继续诚恳地接受批评。许多机关的共产党员领导干部，现在经常主动找非党干部谈心或利用公余休假日到他们家里去谈家常，普遍受到欢迎。各单位在整风运动中设立的改进工作小组，目前仍在积极工作，许多可以解决的问题已经着手解决。例如上海市税务局，职工们提出的需要研究解决的问题，现在80％以上已经得到解决。
