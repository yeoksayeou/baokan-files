Xinhua News Agency report: Many agricultural cooperatives in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, organized their members to debate the question of both developing pig production and saving staple grain.

Since Ningxiang County launched the great debate on the grain issue, some wealthy farmers in the countryside have wanted to blackmail the state on the issue of pig raising, demanding the state purchase less grain and sell more, attempting to use staple grain to feed pigs to achieve personal enrichment. Some wealthy farmers even proposed that they would not feed pigs unless they kept one hundred to two hundred catties of feed grain per pig.

After discovering this problem, the Ningxiang County Party Committee immediately instructed agricultural cooperatives in various places to focus on debating the question of "Can pig production be developed without retaining grain after land allocation?" at the end of the grain issue debate. During the debate in Datianfang Agricultural Cooperative, they calculated an account: if each pig was retained one hundred catties of grain, then the pigs raised by the entire cooperative would require two hundred and six thousand catties, equivalent to half of all food rations. In that case, the one hundred and ninety-eight thousand catties of grain that the state purchased from the cooperative this year would not only not be handed over or sold, but the state would have to supplement eight thousand catties of grain to make it enough. After calculation, the members unanimously believed that this kind of thinking that only cares about oneself and disregards the country is undesirable. Pig raising is a side business that one does oneself and cannot rely on the state. Some wealthy middle peasants in Lijingpu Cooperative said: "Pigs not eating grain is like people not eating oil and salt. If grain is planned, no one will raise pigs. I will even sell the pigs I have now." Many poor peasants immediately refuted their fallacy with facts. Poor peasant Zhu Dongmei said: "Last year, my fat pig weighing two hundred and sixteen catties was entirely raised on melons, vegetables, and rice bran. My family retained food rations according to the 'three fix' standards last year, but I did not use staple grain to feed pigs, and we still had old grain to eat when the early rice was harvested." Poor peasant Zhu Guowu said: I shouldn't only care about myself and disregard the country, wanting to ask the state for more grain in the name of raising pigs. He guaranteed that he would not use staple grain to feed a pig weighing one hundred and ninety catties and sell it to the state.

Through the debate, the cooperative members distinguished right from wrong, and the thinking of some wealthy farmers who wanted to use staple grain to feed pigs also changed. After research, the Ningxiang County Party Committee instructed agricultural cooperatives to increase private plots and distribute them to members to grow feed crops, and to lend the medium and small-sized ponds that were originally entered into the cooperative to members to breed water hyacinth. While planning feed, agricultural cooperatives also inspected the development of pig production in the previous period and made plans for pig production in 1958. Now, the enthusiasm of farmers for raising pigs is increasing. The number of pigs raised in Lijingpu Cooperative has increased from three hundred and fifty-seven to four hundred and one, and four households that had never raised pigs before have also started raising pigs.

### 养猪和节约主粮有无矛盾？  宁乡农民辩论后认为养猪可以不用主粮

    养猪和节约主粮有无矛盾？
    宁乡农民辩论后认为养猪可以不用主粮
    据新华社讯　湖南省宁乡县许多农业社，组织社员对既要发展生猪又要节省主粮问题进行了辩论。
    宁乡县自从开展粮食问题大辩论后，农村中的部分富裕农民想从养猪问题上要挟国家对粮食少购多销，企图用主粮喂猪，达到个人发财的目的。有的富裕农民竟提出，每头猪不留一百斤到二百斤饲料谷，就不喂了。
    中共宁乡县委发现这个问题后，立即指示各地农业社在粮食问题辩论的末期，着重辩论“拨地不留粮，能否发展生猪生产”的问题。大田方农业社在辩论时算了一笔账：如果每头猪留一百斤粮食，则全社所喂的猪要留二十万六千斤，相当于全部口粮的一半，那么今年国家向社里征购的十九万八千斤粮不但全部不交不售，还要国家补给八千斤粮食才够。经过算账，社员们一致认为这种只顾自己不顾国家的思想要不得，喂猪是自己搞的副业，不能靠国家。历经铺社有的富裕中农说：“猪不吃谷米，等于人不吃油盐，要计划用粮就没人养猪了，我连现在的猪也要卖掉。”许多贫农立即用事实驳斥了他们的这种谬论。贫农朱东美说：“去年我那头二百一十六斤重的肥猪，就全是用瓜菜、米糠喂大的。我家去年是按“三定”标准留的口粮，但我没有用主粮喂猪，到打早谷时还有陈谷吃。”贫农朱国五说：我不应该只顾自己不顾国家，借养猪为名想向国家多要粮食。他保证不用主粮，喂一头一百九十斤重的猪卖给国家。
    通过辩论，各社社员分清了是非，部分要用主粮喂猪的富裕农民，思想也有了转变。中共宁乡县委经研究后，指示各农业社增加自留地，分给社员种饲料作物，并将原来入社的中、小型池塘借给社员繁殖水浮莲。各农业社在规划饲料的同时，都检查了前一段生猪生产发展的情况，并作出了1958年的生猪生产计划。现在，农民养猪积极性正在提高。历经铺社养的猪由三百五十七头增加到四百零一头，有四户从来没喂过猪的社员也喂起猪来了。
