Shenyang Holds Firefighting Technical Sports Competition

　　(From our newspaper) According to Shenyang Daily news: Shenyang City held its first city-wide firefighting technical sports competition on the 13th and 14th.

　　Excellent firefighters gathered at a spacious sports field in Tiexi District, Shenyang, to review the growth of firefighting techniques over the past few years. On the 14th, the finals of the 100-meter firefighting obstacle course were held on the sports field. A fully equipped "firefighter" carrying a ladder ran quickly to the first 3.5-meter-high obstacle, erected the ladder and crossed over, then ran to the second obstacle—a 2.5-meter-high wooden wall. Using the force of his sprint, he flipped over the wooden wall and picked up two coils of fire hose, each weighing more than ten kilograms, on the track. He stepped onto a seven-meter-long single-plank bridge. After crossing the single-plank bridge, a low, ten-meter-long wooden cage blocked his path. He quickly unrolled the two coils of hose, crawled into the wooden cage, and advanced on his stomach. This athlete completed all of this in just forty-one seconds. This athlete was Liu Dongjiu from the Sujiatun Fire Brigade, and he won the championship in this event with this result.

　　In the "Hook Ladder Climbing" competition, Fang Lianbo from the Dadong District Fire Brigade, in a time of twenty-five and one-tenth seconds, used the ladder to hook onto the window and climbed layer by layer to the fifth floor of the training tower.

　　The 400-meter relay race was a demonstration of firefighters fighting the fire collectively. They crossed one obstacle after another, handing the water hose to the fourth runner, who then went to extinguish the raging fire near the finish line. All of these actions took only one minute, thirty-five and five-tenths seconds.

　　This novel sports competition aroused great interest among the people.

　　沈阳举行消防技术体育竞赛
    本报讯　据沈阳日报消息：沈阳市在13、14两日举行了全市首届消防技术体育竞赛大会。
    优秀的消防战士们聚集在沈阳市铁西区的一个宽敞的运动场上，检阅着几年来消防技术的成长。14日，运动场上进行着百公尺消防障决赛。一个全副装备的“消防员”扛着梯子，飞快的跑到第一道三公尺半高障碍的跟前，搭梯而过，又奔向第二道障碍——二公尺半高的木墙，他用冲跑的力量，翻过了这道木墙，在跑道上提起两盘十几公斤重的水龙带。踏上了七公尺长的独木桥。当他越过了独木桥后，一条低低的十公尺长的木笼，挡住了去路。他迅速地展开了两盘水带，钻进木笼，匐匍前进。这位运动员仅仅用四十一秒的时间，就把这一切完成了。这个运动员是苏家屯消防队的刘东久，他用这个成绩，取得了这个项目的冠军。
    在“挂抅梯”的比赛中，大东区消防队的方连波，以二十五秒一的时间，用梯子挂在窗口上，一层一层地踏上了练习塔的五层楼。
    四百公尺接力赛，是消防战士们集体与火搏斗的表演。他们越过一道道的障碍，把喷水的管枪交给第四棒，然后，由他去扑灭在接近终点的熊熊烈火，这一切动作只用一分三十五秒五的时间。
    这种新颖的体育竞赛，引起了人们的极大兴趣。
