    Automated Coal Washing Plant
    The largest automated coal washing plant in our country to date, the Matou Coal Washing Plant, broke ground on September 13 near the Fengfeng Coal Mine. Once this large-scale coal washing plant is completed, the raw coal produced by the Fengfeng Coal Mine can be washed and sorted locally, and then the clean coal can be directly supplied to steel factories for coking. It will be able to process two million tons of clean coal annually.
    The Matou Coal Washing Plant was designed with the help of the Soviet Union.

    自动化洗选煤厂
    我国目前规模最大的自动化洗选煤厂——马头洗选煤厂9月13日在峰峰煤矿附近开土兴建。这座大型洗选煤厂建成以后，峰峰煤矿生产的原煤就能就地洗选出来，然后把精煤直接供给钢铁厂炼焦。它每年可选出二百万吨精煤。
    马头洗选煤厂是苏联帮助我国设计的。
