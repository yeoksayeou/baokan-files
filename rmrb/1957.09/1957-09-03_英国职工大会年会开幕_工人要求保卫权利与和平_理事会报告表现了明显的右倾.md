(Special dispatch from our reporter in Blackpool, September 2nd) The 89th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress, with over eight million members, opened here this morning. The annual council report and proposals from various trade union organizations have been printed and distributed before the meeting. The five-day meeting will discuss these and pass corresponding resolutions.

The seventy-seven motions submitted to this year's annual meeting reflect the growing political enthusiasm of ordinary trade union members and the widespread dissatisfaction with the policies of the Conservative government. Six trade union organizations have jointly proposed a motion demanding an immediate halt to the testing and production of nuclear weapons. The National Union of Furniture Trade Operatives' motion calls for the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations "without delay." The Seamen's Union's motion welcomes the relaxation of the "embargo" on China and calls for further expansion of British trade with the East. The Electrical Trades Union calls for the establishment of a European collective security system, including the United States and the Soviet Union, to facilitate the solution of German reunification and the withdrawal of foreign troops. On domestic issues, the wage issue has been placed on the agenda as the most acute problem. The Transport and General Workers' Union, with 1.25 million members, the National Union of Mineworkers, with 700,000 members, and the National Union of Municipal Workers, with 900,000 members, and four other major trade unions, jointly demand that the annual meeting "reject the principle of wage restraint in any form" and advocate that wages should be adjusted according to price increases. In addition, important proposals on domestic issues include: a twenty-four-hour strike to protest the abolition of the Rent Control Act; increased pensions and social welfare; shorter working hours, etc.

These proposals reflect the demands and aspirations of the British working class. In contrast, the Council's report expresses a clear rightward leaning on many major issues. The report does not mention the general strike this spring, and does not put forward a clear position on the wage issue. It complains that automation is being promoted too slowly in British industry, and rarely mentions the issue of protecting workers' rights due to automation. In foreign policy, it supports the Conservative Party's free trade zone plan. In particular, this report raises the so-called "Hungarian question," making malicious slanders against the Hungarian people and the Soviet Union. It is believed that the raising of this issue, in addition to achieving the goal of the "Cold War," also shows that the Council is attempting to further restrict the exchanges and contacts between British trade unions and trade unions in socialist countries. In Chairman Williamson's opening speech, the issue of nuclear weapons testing, which is of the greatest concern to the vast majority of the British people, was not mentioned at all.

This annual meeting clearly shows the two different tendencies in the British trade union movement. The British working masses demand that the Trades Union Congress support their struggle to defend their living rights and world peace; a small number of leaders of the Trades Union Congress will use their position and the unique voting methods of this organization to restrain and control the annual meeting.

### 英国职工大会年会开幕  工人要求保卫权利与和平  理事会报告表现了明显的右倾

    英国职工大会年会开幕
    工人要求保卫权利与和平
    理事会报告表现了明显的右倾
    本报布莱克浦2日专电  拥有八百多万会员的英国职工大会第八十九届年会，今天上午在此间开幕。一年一度的理事会报告及各工会组织的提案，已在会前印发。为期五天的会议，将据此进行讨论，并通过相应的决议。
    提给本届年会的七十七件议案，反映了工会普通会员政治积极性的增长，以及对于保守党政府政策的普遍不满。有六个工会组织联合提出提案，要求立即停止试验与生产核子武器。全国家具工人工会的提案，要求“决不拖延地”恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。海员工会的提案对放宽对中国的“禁运”表示欢迎，并要求进一步扩大英国同东方的贸易。电气工人工会呼吁建立包括美苏在内的欧洲集体安全体系，以利于解决德国统一和撤退外国驻军问题。在国内问题上，工资问题已作为最尖锐的问题，被提到议事日程上来。拥有一百二十五万会员的运输与一般工人工会、七十万会员的全国矿工工会和九十万会员的市政工人工会等七大工会，联合要求年会“拒绝以任何形式限制工资的原则”，主张工资应随物价的上涨而调整。除此以外，有关国内问题的重要提案尚有：举行二十四小时罢工以抗议取消房租管制法案；增加养老金及社会福利；缩短工时等等。
    这些提案反映了英国工人阶级的要求与愿望。与此相反，理事会的报告在许多重大问题上，表示了明显的右倾。报告没有提到今年春季的大罢工，在工资问题上没有提出明确的主张。它埋怨自动化在英国工业中推广得太慢，而很少谈到由于自动化而引起的保卫工人权利问题。在外交政策上，它支持保守党的自由贸易区计划。特别是，这个报告提出了所谓“匈牙利问题”，对匈牙利人民和苏联进行恶意的诽谤。人们认为，这一问题的提出，除了达到“冷战”的目的以外，还表明理事会企图进一步限制英国工会和社会主义国家工会的交往和接触。在主席威廉逊的开幕词中，对广大英国人民所最关怀的核武器试验问题却只字不提。
    本届年会明显地表明了英国职工运动中的两种不同倾向。英国工人群众要求职工大会支持他们为保卫生活权利和世界和平而进行的斗争；职工大会的少数领袖，则将利用他们的地位和这个组织所特有的一套表决方法，对年会加以约束和控制。
