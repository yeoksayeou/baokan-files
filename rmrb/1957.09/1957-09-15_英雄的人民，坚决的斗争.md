Despite the American aggressors' repeated threats and intimidation towards Syria, and their deployment of multifaceted conspiracies, Syria still heroically and unyieldingly adheres to its position of national independence, engaging in a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali announced on the 12th that the heroic Syrian people are prepared to cope with all eventualities. Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief General Bizri also said in Cairo on the same day that the Syrian people are determined to defend their freedom, prepared to deal with any situation, fulfill their obligations, and achieve victory.

The heroic spirit of the Syrian people, determined to fight to the end for the independence and freedom of their motherland, fills all those who support Syria's just cause with boundless admiration. The Chinese people, who have waged a long struggle against imperialism and achieved great victory, can fully appreciate the feelings of the Syrian people now. We, the Chinese people, are determined to stand together with peace-loving people all over the world and resolutely support the Syrian people's struggle against aggression.

U.S. imperialism has been trying to isolate Syria. However, the reality is completely contrary to what it hopes for. Faced with American aggression, Syria has not only mobilized the entire nation, but also further strengthened its unity with all peace-loving countries in the world. But the United States, which deliberately invaded Syria, and its small group of accomplices, are increasingly exposing their ugly faces to the world. They have been strongly condemned by world opinion and are therefore becoming increasingly isolated. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had to put on a sheep's skin over the wolf, releasing a smokescreen to cover up his blatant intention to invade Syria, which he openly declared in his statement on the Syrian situation on the 7th of this month. He said at a press conference on the 10th of this month that the United States has not yet determined whether the Syrian issue falls within the scope of applying the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The American propaganda machine then spread the air, as if the United States had changed to a so-called "moderate" attitude towards Syria.

However, this smokescreen of the United States cannot deceive anyone. Facts prove that the U.S. conspiracy to invade Syria has not changed. Syrian Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Nifri revealed that two Turkish infantry divisions and one armored tank division have been assembled on the Syrian-Turkish border according to U.S. orders. Aircraft of unknown nationality are constantly flying in the Latakia region of northern Syria, close to the Syrian-Turkish border. Israel, also acting on U.S. instructions, is constantly making provocations on the Syrian-Israeli border. At the same time, a so-called "Syrian government in exile" composed of Syrian traitors is being organized in Turkey. From these obvious facts, it can be seen that the United States has not relaxed its preparations to eliminate Syria by using military intervention in conjunction with subversive activities.

It is particularly worth noting that after Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko made a solemn warning to the United States about the U.S. conspiracy to invade Syria, the U.S. State Department issued an extremely arrogant and reckless statement on the 12th. This statement described the U.S. policy and goals of aggression in the Middle East as belonging to the entire so-called "free world" and openly declared that the Soviet Union's just condemnation "will not stop" the U.S. aggression against Syria. The U.S. State Department also falsely accused the Soviet Union's action to maintain peace in the Middle East and the world as deliberately "destroying the bridges of understanding that still maintain our hopes for peace." This is clearly an attempt to preemptively shift the responsibility for destroying peace and igniting the flames of war in the Middle East onto the Soviet Union. This sinister statement by the U.S. State Department fully demonstrates the determination of U.S. imperialism to invade Syria.

The Syrian people and the broad masses of people in the Middle East have long seen through this ambitious wolf of the United States. Egypt's "Al-Gomhuria" pointed out sharply: nothing has changed; "but no one is afraid of Dulles's threats, and no one will be fooled by his moderate tone." The determination expressed by Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali and General Bizri on behalf of the Syrian people to be prepared to cope with all eventualities proves that Syria is highly vigilant against all the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism.

Since the United States will never cease its aggression against the Middle East, the struggle of the Syrian people and the people of the Middle East against U.S. imperialism and in defense of independence will be long, complex and arduous. However, victory will surely belong to the Syrian people and the people of the Middle East. The Chinese people fully understand the truth that peace is indivisible. Today, the struggle of the Syrian people is part of the world's struggle to defend peace. Therefore, the Chinese people regard supporting the struggle of the Syrian people as their own responsibility. We wholeheartedly congratulate the Syrian people on the significant achievements they have already made in crushing U.S. subversive activities and exposing U.S. aggressive conspiracies, and we believe that their sacred cause of opposing U.S. aggression and defending the independence and freedom of their motherland will surely be completely victorious.

### 英雄的人民，坚决的斗争

　　英雄的人民，坚决的斗争
    尽管美国侵略者对叙利亚进行了百般的威胁和恫吓，施展了多方面的阴谋手段，但是叙利亚仍然英勇不屈地坚持着民族独立的立场，同美帝国主义和它的走狗们进行着坚决的斗争。叙利亚总理阿萨利先生在12日宣布，英雄的叙利亚人民已经准备好应付一切事变。叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里将军同一天在开罗也说，叙利亚人民决心要保卫他们的自由；准备应付任何局势，履行他们的义务和取得胜利。
    叙利亚人民这种决心为祖国的独立自由斗争到底的英勇气概，使一切支持叙利亚的正义事业的人们感到无限的钦佩。曾经同帝国主义者进行长期斗争并取得伟大胜利的中国人民，完全能够体会叙利亚人民现在的感情。我们中国人民决心同世界上爱好和平的人民一起，坚决支持叙利亚人民的反侵略斗争。
    美帝国主义一直企图孤立叙利亚。可是，事实同它所希望的完全相反。面对着美国的侵略，叙利亚不仅动员了全国人民，而且进一步加强了同世界上所有爱好和平的国家的团结。而蓄意侵略叙利亚的美国和它的一小撮同谋者，却在世界面前愈来愈暴露出它们的丑恶面目。它们受到了世界舆论的强烈谴责，因而愈来愈陷于孤立的境地。美国国务卿杜勒斯不得不把羊皮披在狼身上，施放一阵烟幕，来遮掩他在本月7日就叙利亚局势发表的声明中露骨地宣布侵略叙利亚的凶恶意图。他在本月10日的记者招待会上说，美国还没有断定叙利亚问题是否属于应用“艾森豪威尔主义”的范围。美国的宣传机器紧接着就散布空气，似乎美国对叙利亚已经改而采取了所谓“温和”的态度。
    但是，美国的这种烟幕是欺骗不了任何人的。事实证明，美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋并没有改变。叙利亚武装部队副参谋长尼福里揭露，土耳其的两个步兵师、一个装甲坦克师，已经根据美国的命令集结在叙、土边境。国籍不明的飞机不断在靠近叙、土边境的叙利亚北部拉塔基亚地区飞行。以色列也按照美国的指示，不断在叙、以边境蠢动，制造挑衅事件。同时，一个由叙利亚的叛国分子组成的所谓“叙利亚流亡政府”，正在土耳其组织之中。从这些明显的事实可以看出，美国丝毫没有放松用军事干涉配合颠复活动来消灭叙利亚的准备步骤。
    特别值得注意的是，在苏联外交部长葛罗米柯就美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋向美国提出严正的警告以后，美国国务院在12日发表了一个极端蛮横放肆的声明。这个声明把美国侵略中东的政策和目标说成是整个所谓“自由世界”的，并且公然宣称苏联的正义谴责“将不能制止”美国对叙利亚的侵略。美国国务院还把苏联这个维护中东和世界和平的行动，诬蔑为故意“破坏那些仍然维持着我们对和平的希望的谅解的桥梁”。这显然是企图预先把破坏和平、在中东点燃战火的责任推到苏联头上。美国国务院这个用心叵测的声明，充分说明了美帝国主义侵略叙利亚的决心。
    叙利亚人民和中东的广大人民早就看穿了美国这只野心狼。埃及“共和国报”一针见血地指出：一切都没有变；“但是谁都不怕杜勒斯的威胁，谁都不会被他的温和的口吻所愚弄”。叙利亚阿萨利总理和比兹里将军代表叙利亚人民所表达的准备应付一切事变的决心，证明叙利亚对于美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计都有着高度的警惕。
    由于美国决不会停止对中东的侵略，因此，叙利亚人民和中东人民反对美帝国主义、保卫独立的斗争，将是长期、复杂而且艰苦的。但是，胜利必定属于叙利亚人民和中东人民。中国人民充分理解和平不可分割的这一真理。今天叙利亚人民的斗争，是全世界保卫和平的斗争的一部分。因此，中国人民把支持叙利亚人民的斗争看作是自己的责任。我们衷心祝贺叙利亚人民在粉碎美国的颠复活动、揭露美国的侵略阴谋方面已经取得的重大成就，并且相信他们反对美国侵略、保卫祖国的独立和自由的神圣事业一定能够得到彻底胜利。
