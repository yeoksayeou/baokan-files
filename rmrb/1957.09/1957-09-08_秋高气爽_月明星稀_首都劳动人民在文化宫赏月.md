Crisp Autumn Air, Sparse Moonlight
　　Laboring People of the Capital Appreciate the Moon at the Cultural Palace

　　(Our newspaper reports) On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Beijing Laboring People's Cultural Palace held a Mid-Autumn moon-viewing party. People, bathed in moonlight, walked into the Cultural Palace. In the Production Technology Research Office, people listened to Mid-Autumn Festival folk tales, and then went to Daji Gate to hear a science report, "Flying to the Moon." On the Cultural Garden's plaza, workers, students, staff, and soldiers danced to their hearts' content. The Xidan District Workers' Orchestra specially selected Chinese classical music such as "Autumn Moon on a Calm Lake" for accompaniment. People enjoyed concerts at the Houhe Tea House, and could also enjoy Qiu Shengrong performing "Yao Qi" at the Labor Theater. The National Coal Mine Women's Basketball Team and the Tianjin Women's Team, the Beijing Garrison Men's Basketball Team and the Changchun Men's Basketball Team competed on the sports field. Until late at night, people were still singing and dancing to their hearts' content under the sparse moonlight.

　　According to people familiar with the situation in Beijing, such a grand occasion had never occurred before liberation. The mooncakes and fruits that people love to eat are not "worse than before," but are countless times better than in the past. Take mooncakes, for example; in the past, not every family could afford them. This year, Beijing supplied enough mooncakes for each person to receive more than half a catty on average. Zhengmingzhai, a famous Beijing mooncake shop, made more than 100,000 catties of various mooncakes just for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Dao Xiang Cun's specially made Suzhou and Guangdong mooncakes were supplied continuously, and the lines of people buying mooncakes every day were endless. Speaking of fruit, this year there are Hami melons from Xinjiang flown in by plane, as well as Bailan melons and watermelons from Lanzhou. In the past, peaches were unavailable every Mid-Autumn Festival, but this year, fragrant and delicious honey peaches can be bought in fruit stores or fruit stalls. In particular, tropical fruits shipped from Guangdong, such as red grapes (shaped like green peppers), are fruits that Beijingers have never eaten before. (Attached picture)

    秋高气爽　月明星稀
    首都劳动人民在文化宫赏月
    本报讯　中秋前夕，北京劳动人民文化宫举办了中秋赏月晚会。人们踏着月色，走进文化宫。在生产技术研究室，人们听了中秋节民间故事，又到大戟门听了科学报告——“飞向月球”。在文化园的广场上，工人、学生、职员和军人尽情地跳舞。西单区工人乐队专门选了中国古典乐曲“平湖秋月”等伴奏。人们在后河茶座上欣赏了音乐会，还可以在劳动剧场欣赏裘盛戎上演的“姚期”。全国煤矿的女子篮球队和天津市的女子队，驻京部队的男子篮球队和长春市的男子篮球队在体育场上进行比赛。直到深夜，人们还在月明星稀下，尽情地歌舞。
    据熟悉北京情况的人说，在解放前，从来没有过这种盛况。人们最爱吃的月饼和水果，不是“今不如昔”，而是今天比过去不知好了多少倍。就拿月饼来说，过去不是每家都可以吃得起的，今年北京市供应的月饼，平均每个人可以得到半斤以上。北京闻名的月饼铺正明斋光是供应中秋节的各种月饼就做了十万多斤，稻香村特制的姑苏和广东月饼，更是源源供应，每天排队买月饼的人，络绎不绝。谈到水果，今年有从飞机上运来的新疆哈密瓜，还有兰州的白兰瓜和西瓜。往日每到中秋就吃不到桃，今年无论在水果店或水果摊上都可以买到清香可口的蜜桃。特别是从广东运来的热带水果，如红葡萄（形如青椒）等，更是以前北京人没有吃过的水果。（附图片）
