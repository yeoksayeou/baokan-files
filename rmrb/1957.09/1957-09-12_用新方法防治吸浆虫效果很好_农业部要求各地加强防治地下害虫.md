New Methods for Preventing Wheat Blossom Midge Are Very Effective
Ministry of Agriculture Requests All Regions to Strengthen Prevention of Underground Pests

    This newspaper reports that some areas in Henan and Shanxi will continue to test new methods developed by the North China Agricultural Research Institute this autumn to prevent wheat blossom midge. This method involves applying 6% "666" powder or 5% "DDT" to the soil before sowing wheat during tilling, or during early spring wheat hoeing, to kill the larvae, pupae, and a small number of emerged adult midges lurking in the soil by using pesticides.

    The wheat blossom midge is a serious pest that harms wheat. In many areas, wheat production has been reduced or even lost due to its damage. In the past, the main method of controlling this pest was to spread "666" powder to kill adult midges. This method has disadvantages such as requiring a lot of effort and making it difficult to grasp the timing. The new method is more economical and proactive.

    Because "666" and other substances have the effect of killing other pests, using this method to control wheat blossom midge can also control grubs, wireworms, mole crickets, and wheat garden spiders in wheat fields, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop.

    This newspaper reports that on the 7th of this month, the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice to the agricultural leadership departments of all winter wheat regions, provinces, and cities to strengthen the prevention and control of underground pests and wheat smut disease. The notice said: Underground pests are the main pests that harm wheat. To ensure that this year's winter wheat seedlings are complete and vigorous, all regions should actively prevent and control them. The notice recommended the use of "666" seed dressing and the preparation of poisoned grains and poisoned soil, which have proven effective in trials over the years.

    Disinfecting wheat seeds during sowing is a good way to prevent wheat smut disease. The notice also requires all regions to do this work well at the same time.

　　用新方法防治吸浆虫效果很好
　　农业部要求各地加强防治地下害虫
    本报讯　河南、山西的一些地区将在今秋继续试用华北农科所研究出来的防治小麦吸浆虫的新方法。这种方法是把6％的“六六六”粉或5％的“滴滴涕”，在种麦以前耕地的时候，或是在早春锄麦的时候施入土中，利用农药杀死土中潜伏的吸浆虫幼虫、蛹和少量羽化的成虫。
    小麦吸浆虫是严重为害小麦的一种害虫，许多地区都曾因它的为害而使小麦减产甚至失收。过去扑杀这种害虫的主要方法是撒“六六六”粉杀灭成虫。这样防治有费力较大和不易掌握时机等缺点。用新方法可以更加经济、主动。
    由于“六六六”等具有杀死别的害虫的作用，用这种方法防治吸浆虫还可以兼治麦地里的蛴螬、金针虫、蝼蛄和麦园蜘蛛等，一举几得。
    本报讯　农业部本月7日向各冬麦区的省、市农业领导部门发出加强防治地下害虫、麦类黑穗病的通知。通知说：地下害虫是为害小麦的主要害虫，为了保证今年的冬麦苗全、苗旺，各地应该积极加以防治。通知中推荐了几年来试用证明效果良好的用“六六六”拌种和制毒谷、毒土的防治办法。
    在播种时对麦种进行消毒处理，是预防麦类黑穗病的一个好方法。通知中也要求各地同时作好这项工作。
