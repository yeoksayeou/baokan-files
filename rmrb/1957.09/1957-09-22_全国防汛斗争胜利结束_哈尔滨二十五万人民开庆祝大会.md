Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: The flood peak of the Songhua River has safely entered the Heilong River, marking the victorious conclusion of this year's national flood control struggle.

During this year's flood season, the water levels of the main streams of the Yangtze River and Huai River, as well as the Hai River in North China, remained stable. The Pearl River and Yellow River experienced major floods. The Songhua River and the Shaying River, a tributary of the Yi, Shu, and Huai Rivers, experienced extraordinarily large floods. Thanks to the flood control, diversion, and discharge functions of existing projects on the rivers, and especially thanks to the strong leadership of Party and government organizations at all levels and the diligent flood prevention efforts of the broad masses, this year's flood control struggle achieved a comprehensive victory.

The achievements made in fighting floods this year are enormous. However, due to the large and concentrated rainfall in some areas, which lasted for a long time, relatively serious losses were also incurred.

This year, the Central Flood Control Headquarters provided tremendous support to various regions in terms of manpower and materials. The Chinese People's Liberation Army also provided strong support to this year's flood control struggle.

In order to lay a good foundation for next year's flood control work, various regions are currently repairing dikes that were damaged during the flood season and summarizing the flood control work.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 21st: The people of Harbin gathered this afternoon to celebrate the victory in fighting the largest flood ever recorded in the Songhua River. More than 250,000 people attended the celebration rally.

Lu Qien, General Commander of the Harbin Flood Control Headquarters and Mayor of the city, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the ability of the people of Harbin to overcome a flood reaching 120.30 meters was due to the people of the entire city and all flood control fighters, and due to the leadership of the Communist Party. This also demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. He said that at the beginning of the flood control struggle, the Party made timely arrangements and put forward the slogan "Absolute safety, ensure Harbin," laying the foundation for the people's confidence in the struggle, and now this slogan has been fully realized. Lu Qien pointed out that the heroic actions of the people in the flood control struggle demonstrated the people's high level of awareness and sense of responsibility in loving the motherland, loving the Communist Party, loving the socialist system, and loving their hometown.

At the meeting, Yu Jie, General Commander of the Heilongjiang Provincial Flood Control Headquarters and Deputy Governor of the province, presented a banner on behalf of the Central Flood Control Headquarters to the heroic people of Harbin. The Harbin Flood Control Headquarters also awarded flags and medals to 125 model units and 9,929 model individuals in the flood control struggle. (See picture)

    全国防汛斗争胜利结束
    哈尔滨二十五万人民开庆祝大会
    据新华社21日讯　松花江的洪峰已经安然进入黑龙江，至此，今年全国的防汛斗争胜利结束。
    今年汛期，长江、淮河干流和华北海河的水情一直平稳；珠江和黄河出现了大水；松花江和沂沭河、淮河支流沙?河出现了特大洪水。由于各河已有的工程发挥了拦洪、分洪、泄洪的作用，特别是由于各级党政领导机关的有力领导和广大群众的努力防汛，今年的防汛斗争获得了全面的胜利。
    今年各地与洪水斗争所取得的成就是巨大的。但是由于有些地区雨量大而集中，持续时间长，也造成了比较严重的损失。
    今年中央防汛总指挥部对各地的防汛斗争在人力和物力上给予了极大的支援。中国人民解放军对今年的防汛斗争也给予了大力的支持。
    为了给明年的防汛工作打好基础，当前各地正在整修汛期被破坏的堤防和对防汛工作进行总结。
    据新华社哈尔滨21日电　哈尔滨人民今天下午集会，庆祝对松花江有水文纪录以来的最大洪水作斗争所获得的胜利。参加庆祝大会的有二十五万多人。
    哈尔滨市防汛指挥部总指挥、市长吕其恩在会上讲话。他指出：哈尔滨市人民能够战胜高达一二○· 三○公尺的洪水，应归功于全市人民和全体防汛战士，应归功于共产党的领导，这同时也说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。他说：防汛斗争一开始，党就及时作了部署，提出了“万无一失，确保哈尔滨”的口号，奠定了人民斗争的信心，现在这一口号完全实现了。吕其恩指出，在防汛斗争中人民的英雄行为，显示了人民热爱祖国、热爱共产党、热爱社会主义制度和热爱自己的家乡的高度觉悟和责任感。
    会上，黑龙江省防汛指挥部总指挥、副省长于杰，代表中央防汛总指挥部授予英雄的哈尔滨人民一面锦旗，哈尔滨市防汛指挥部也分别以奖旗、奖章奖励了防汛斗争中的一百二十五个模范单位和九千九百二十九名模范人员。（附图片）
