    Facts Are Invincible
    Zhang Fangzuo, Vice President of the Textile Science Research Institute
    Rightist elements say that the Communist Party cannot lead scientific and technological work and cultural and educational undertakings. I say that only the Communist Party can lead. China began using machines to spin yarn more than sixty years ago, but until liberation, the total number of spindles was only three million; however, in the short eight years since the founding of New China, 2.4 million spindles have been added. This speed was unimaginable before liberation. In the past, all equipment was imported from abroad, but now it is entirely domestically produced, and the quality is first-rate. At the time of liberation, the output of raw cotton was only seven million dan, but now it has increased to more than 30 million dan, and the fiber length has increased from 7/8 inch to over 1 inch; the annual output of cotton yarn has increased from 1.6 million pieces to 5 million pieces; in the past, the daily output of a fine spinning machine was less than one pound, but now it reaches more than 1.4 pounds; the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn has also been reduced from 420 jin to less than 390 jin.
    Before liberation, I suggested to the Kuomintang-controlled China Textile Corporation that they manufacture a complete set of textile machines with 100,000 spindles. They reluctantly approved 30,000 spindles, but later only manufactured the frames for 3,000 spindles. But now, with the same mechanical equipment and the same manpower, 200,000 to 300,000 first-class spindles can be produced annually in less than a year.
    In old China, poor professors' entire salaries were not enough to pay the rent, and scientific and technological workers were impoverished and had no place to use their talents. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the ranks of scientific and educational workers have grown many times over. Taking the East China Textile Institute of Technology as an example, originally only 70 graduates were produced each year, and graduation meant unemployment. Now, 500 to 600 excellent graduates are taking up construction posts every year. Before liberation, the textile science research institution was only a cotton experiment hall with twelve staff members and a few foreign cotton spinning machines. Its purpose was to facilitate advertising for capitalist countries. After liberation, the Textile Science Research Institute was established in Beijing and Shanghai. The two institutes have more than 500 researchers and staff members, responsible for studying various types of textile technology and new technologies for cotton, wool, silk, hemp, and chemical fibers. In addition, there are various local research institutes, and research work is also being carried out in various schools and enterprises. Under the leadership of the Party, scientific and technological workers engaged in the textile industry across the country have the confidence to catch up with the world level within twelve years.
    I have worked in textile mills for more than thirty years. Before liberation, I personally witnessed workers forced by life to work while sick. In summer, the temperature in the workshops often exceeded 100 degrees, and many workers fainted. After liberation, air conditioning equipment was installed in all factories, and the temperature in the workshops was lower than outside. The new houses built by the state for textile workers cover more than 700,000 square meters.
    Facts are invincible. Rightist elements say that the Communist Party cannot lead scientific and technological work and cultural and educational undertakings. Countless facts prove that only the Communist Party can lead.

    事实不可战胜
    纺织科学研究院副院长　张方佐
    右派分子说，共产党不能领导科学技术工作和文化教育事业。我说，恰恰只有共产党才能领导。我国远在六十多年以前就开始用机器纺纱了，但直到解放前，纺锭的总数仅有三百万枚；而在新中国成立以后的短短八年中，就新添了二百四十万枚纺锭。这种速度在解放前是无法想像的。过去的设备全靠从国外进口，现在则完全是国产，质量也是头等的。刚解放时，原棉的产量只有七百万担，现在增加到了三千多万担，纤维长度从八分之七英寸提高到一英寸以上；棉纱的年产量从一百六十万件提高到五百万件；过去细纱机每天的产量不到一磅，现在达到一磅四以上；每件纱的用棉量也由四百二十斤减少到三百九十斤以内。
    解放前，我曾向伪中纺公司建议自制十万纱锭的全套纺织机器，他们勉强批准了三万锭，后来仅仅制造了三千锭的车框。而现在，用同样的机械设备和同样的人力，不到一年的时间，就能年产头等纱锭二三十万枚。
    旧中国的穷教授，全部薪金还不够付房租，科学技术工作者穷愁潦倒，没有用武之地。解放后，在共产党的领导下，科学教育工作队伍壮大了很多倍。就以华东纺织工学院来说，原来每年的毕业生只有七十人，毕业就是失业。现在每年有五六百优秀的毕业生走上建设岗位。纺织科学研究机构，解放前只有一个棉业实验馆，有十二个工作人员和几部外国棉纺机，存在的目的是便于资本主义国家作广告。解放后，在北京和上海建立了纺织科学研究院，两个院共有五百多研究人员和工作人员，负责研究棉、毛、丝、麻和化学纤维各类型的纺织工艺和新技术。此外还有各种地方性的研究所，在各学校和企业里也都展开了研究工作。全国从事纺织工业的科学技术工作者，在党的领导下，有信心要在十二年内赶上世界水平。
    我在纺织厂工作了三十多年。解放前我亲眼看到工人受生活的逼迫，抱病工作，夏季车间里的温度经常超过一百度，工人昏倒的很多。解放后，各厂都安了冷气装置，车间温度比外面还低。国家为纺织工人盖的新住宅，有七十多万平方公尺。
    事实是不可战胜的。右派分子说共产党不能领导科学技术工作和文化教育事业，无数的事实证明：恰恰只有共产党才能领导。
