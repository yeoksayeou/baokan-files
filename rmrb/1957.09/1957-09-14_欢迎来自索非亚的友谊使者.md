　　Welcome, friends from the glorious homeland of Dimitrov, people of China! Welcome, envoys of peace and friendship from Sofia—the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria headed by Comrade Yugov.
　　The Bulgarian people are a hardworking, brave, and wise people.
　　The heroic deeds of the Bulgarian people in their long and arduous struggle for liberation in the past have deeply moved the Chinese people. The magnificent achievements of the Bulgarian people in socialist construction under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party in the short span of thirteen years have also won the infinite admiration of the Chinese people. Before liberation, Bulgaria was a backward agricultural country. However, after the people shattered the chains of capitalist exploitation, they immediately demonstrated their amazing strength. With the help of socialist countries and their own efforts, the Bulgarian people have established heavy industries that never existed during the era of bourgeois rule and have rapidly developed light industries. In 1956, modern industry accounted for 67.5% of Bulgaria's total industrial and agricultural output, completely changing the poor and backward state before liberation and becoming an advanced industrial and agricultural country. Now, Bulgaria can not only export industrial products and machines, but also help China, Syria, Albania, and other countries design and build complete industrial enterprises. In agriculture, Bulgaria has basically realized collectivization; 70% of field work is now done by machines. Over the past ten years, the living standards of the Bulgarian people have improved significantly on the basis of continuous economic development.
　　Dear brothers, your achievements and contributions fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm and confidence of the Chinese people in building socialism.
　　The Bulgarian people are a people who love peace and are loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism.
　　As early as 1943, Comrade Dimitrov said: We need Bulgaria's loyal friendship with the Soviet Union, just as every living thing needs the sun and air. He also pointed out that the attitude towards the Soviet Union is the main measure of loyalty to international communism and the workers' movement. These words are deeply engraved in the hearts of every Bulgarian patriot. The unbreakable historical friendship between the Bulgarian and Soviet people, like brothers, was forged and consolidated in the common struggle to free the Bulgarian people from the shackles of oppressors for generations, and in the common struggle against fascism and building socialism. The Bulgarian people have always firmly struggled to safeguard the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
　　The Bulgarian people support the aspirations of all nations for national independence and firmly oppose the US attempt to dominate the Middle East and enslave the Arab people with the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Bulgarian people have made unremitting efforts to achieve universal and large-scale disarmament by all countries, and to ban the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. They oppose the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in creating international tension, and condemn West Germany's remilitarization and preparations for atomic warfare. They are determined to spare no effort to fulfill their obligations under the Warsaw Treaty and advocate a pan-European collective security system to replace military blocs. The Bulgarian people are particularly concerned about the friendly and good-neighborly relations between the Balkan countries. The Bulgarian people persistently strive to defend the UN Charter. The Bulgarian people have consistently given sincere support to the Chinese people's struggle to safeguard their legitimate rights and status in international affairs and the United Nations, and to strive for the restoration of national territorial integrity.
　　Dear brothers, your noble spirit of proletarian internationalism, your peaceful foreign policy, and your just actions have made important contributions to consolidating and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and to maintaining peace in Europe and the world.
　　The Chinese and Bulgarian people have a close fraternal friendship. In 1952, China and Bulgaria signed the first trade agreement and a five-year cultural agreement. Since then, economic exchanges between the two countries have continued to strengthen, and the exchange of goods between the two countries has promoted the development of productive forces on both sides and more fully met the needs of the people of the two fraternal countries. In the past five years, the two countries have carried out cultural cooperation in an organized and planned manner, sending dozens of cultural and artistic delegations to each other, and exchanging students. The frequent contact and exchange of experiences between cultural, artistic, and scientific workers of the two countries have also had a good effect on enhancing mutual understanding between the two peoples and promoting the development of the cultures of the two countries.
　　We believe that through the extensive contact between the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria headed by Comrade Yugov and our Party and government leaders and the masses of the people, the fraternal friendship and cooperation between China and Bulgaria will be further consolidated and developed. This will not only be conducive to the prosperity and happiness of the two countries, but also to the unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union and the strengthening of world peace and democratic forces.

　　欢迎来自索非亚的友谊使者
    中国人民欢迎你们，来自季米特洛夫的光荣祖国的朋友们！欢迎你们，来自索非亚的和平友谊的使者——以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团。
    保加利亚人民是勤劳、勇敢和智慧的人民。
    保加利亚人民过去为解放自己而进行长期艰苦斗争的英雄事迹，曾深深地感动过中国人民。保加利亚人民在光荣的保加利亚共产党的领导下，在短短的十三年中，取得了社会主义建设的辉煌成就，也赢得中国人民的无限钦佩。在解放以前，保加利亚曾经是一个落后的农业国。但是，当人民粉碎了资本主义剥削的锁链之后，立即就显示出自己惊人的力量。保加利亚人民在社会主义阵营各国的帮助和自己的努力下，建立了资产阶级统治时代从未有过的重工业，并且迅速地发展了轻工业。1956年，保加利亚的现代化工业在工农业总产值中所占的比重，已经达到67.5％，完全改变了解放前贫困落后的状态，成为一个先进的工业农业国。现在，保加利亚不仅可以出口工业品和机器，还能帮助中国、叙利亚、阿尔巴尼亚等国设计和建设完备的工业企业。在农业方面，保加利亚已经基本上实现了集体化；70％的田间工作，已经由机器来完成。十多年来，保加利亚人民在经济不断发展的基础上，生活水平已有了显著的提高。
  亲爱的兄弟们，你们的这些成就和贡献，充分显示出社会主义制度比资本主义制度的无比优越性，大大鼓舞了中国人民建设社会主义的热情和信心。
    保加利亚人民是热爱和平、忠于无产阶级国际主义原则的人民。
    远在1943年，季米特洛夫同志说过：我们需要保加利亚同苏联的忠诚友谊，正像每一个生物需要太阳和空气一样。他还指出，对待苏联的态度，是忠于国际共产主义和工人运动的主要尺度。这些话深深地铭刻在每一个保加利亚爱国者的心中。保苏两国人民兄弟般的牢不可破的历史友谊，是在争取保加利亚人民摆脱压迫者世世代代的桎梏的共同斗争中，在反对法西斯和建设社会主义的共同斗争中结成和巩固起来的。保加利亚人民始终坚定地为保卫以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结而斗争。
    保加利亚人民支持各国人民要求民族独立的愿望，坚决反对美国企图独霸中东和奴役阿拉伯各国人民的“艾森豪威尔主义”。保加利亚人民曾经进行不懈的努力，以求达到各国普遍、大量裁减军备，禁止使用原子武器和氢武器。他们反对北大西洋联盟制造国际紧张局势的活动，谴责西德重新军国主义化和原子战争的准备。他们决心奋不顾身地履行对华沙条约所承担的义务，并主张以全欧集体安全体系代替军事集团。保加利亚人民特别关心巴尔干半岛各国之间的友好睦邻关系。保加利亚人民坚持不渝地努力捍卫联合国宪章。保加利亚人民对于中国人民为维护自己在国际事务和联合国中的合法权利和地位、为争取恢复国家领土完整而进行的斗争，一贯给予真诚的支持。
    亲爱的兄弟们，你们的这种崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，你们的和平外交政策和正义行动，对巩固和加强社会主义阵营的团结，对维护欧洲及世界和平作出了重要的贡献。
    中保两国人民具有着亲密的兄弟友谊。1952年，中保两国签订了第一个贸易协定和五年文化协定。从此以后，两国的经济来往不断加强，两国的货物交换促进了双方生产力的发展，并更加完满地满足两个兄弟国家人民的需要。在过去五年中，两国有组织有计划地开展了文化合作，互相派遣了几十个文化艺术代表团，互相交换留学生。两国的文化、艺术和科学工作者之间的频繁接触和交流经验，对于增进两国人民的相互了解和促进两国文化的发展，也产生了良好的效果。
    我们相信，通过以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团和我国党政领导人和人民群众的广泛接触，中保两国兄弟般的友谊合作，将会进一步巩固和发展。这不仅有利于两国的繁荣和幸福，而且也有利于以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的团结与世界和平民主力量的加强。
