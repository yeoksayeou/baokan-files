Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 9th: A grand meeting was held in Sofia on the evening of September 8th to celebrate Bulgaria's National Day.

Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders Damyanov, Yugov, Zhivkov, and others attended the meeting.

Mikhailov, member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a report at the meeting.

In his report, Mikhailov spoke about Bulgaria's achievements in the thirteen years since its liberation. He said that Bulgaria has transformed from an economically backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial and agricultural nation with modern heavy industry and cooperative agriculture. In 1939, industry accounted for 24.8% of the total industrial and agricultural output value; in 1956, it was 67.5%.

Speaking about agricultural issues, Mikhailov pointed out that Bulgaria's agriculture has been basically collectivized. The socialist sector in the countryside occupies more than 85% of the cultivated land and provides more than 90% of the marketable agricultural products. Relying on machine tractor stations, Bulgaria has basically solved the problem of mechanization of the most important agricultural tasks.

Mikhailov then spoke about the material and cultural welfare of the working people. He said that Bulgaria's national income in 1956 had doubled that of 1939. In 1956, residents purchased 269% more commodities than in 1952.

Subsequently, the speaker also talked about the Bulgarian Communist Party's struggle for party unity and iron discipline, the importance of strengthening ties with the masses, and the significance of the socialist camp's unity, and emphasized the need to strengthen the unbreakable friendship between the people of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.
