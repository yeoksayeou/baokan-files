Chairman Mao Reads Big-Character Posters
By our reporters Ji Yin and Xi Ping

A Flower Garden in Full Bloom

On the morning of the 18th, a few cars drove through the gates of the Shanghai State-Owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, stopping with a screech in the small square in front of the office building. As the doors opened, Chairman Mao, dressed in a grey uniform and looking hale and hearty, stepped out with a group of guests. They had come specifically to see the big-character posters.

As soon as Chairman Mao got out of the car, he was met by the big-character posters plastered on both sides of the walkway. There must have been at least two or three thousand posters, densely covering both sides of the walkway from the factory gate to the Nantex workshop, a distance of dozens of meters. Along the sides of the walkway, there were also many wooden boards temporarily erected to display more posters. From this lively scene, it was immediately apparent that the rectification campaign in this factory was in full swing. Chairman Mao surveyed the surroundings, his face breaking into a pleasant smile. He then walked towards the big-character posters, accompanied by two hosts - the Party Secretary and the Factory Director of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory - and began to read them one by one.

The vast expanse of big-character posters unfolded before Chairman Mao was truly like a flower garden in full bloom, so full of vitality. There were criticisms of the work of the Party and the ideological style of some Party cadres, sincere discussions of the political life of the country, suggestions for various tasks, and sharp debates on various erroneous opinions. The forms of the big-character posters were even more lively and diverse, combining pictures and text. There were humorous cartoons, biting satirical poems, doggerel and clapper rhymes, short essays, investigation reports specifically on certain issues, and interesting short plays and dialogues... These thousands of dazzling big-character posters were the collective creation of the thousands of workers of the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. They not only fully expressed the workers' talents but also fully demonstrated their high level of political enthusiasm.

The First Shot of the Great Debate

The first big-character poster that Chairman Mao saw was written by a group of veteran workers, which was a transcript of their speeches at a veteran workers' forum. The veteran workers raised many opinions about the Party and the administration of the factory. In addition, they emphatically stated that they disagreed with some of the erroneous remarks on some big-character posters, such as some people saying that the country was "rich but the people were poor," that "sycophants were all promoted," and that "the lives of the peasants were too hard," and so on. The veteran workers believed that everyone must argue these major issues of right and wrong clearly. This big-character poster was the first shot in the factory-wide debate that was currently unfolding at the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory.

One of the most hotly debated issues among the veteran workers in the big-character posters was the issue of livelihood. A young worker named Tang complained in a big-character poster that his salary was too low, saying that he was "living under a Coptis chinensis tree." The veteran workers engaged him in a debate in the big-character posters. They pointed out that this young worker's salary had increased every year since he joined the factory in 1951. In 1951, his salary was 40 yuan when he first entered the factory, and last year it had been adjusted to 56.5 yuan, with an average of nearly 20 yuan of living expenses per person for a family of three. The big-character poster wrote: "Tang Xuegen, think about what kind of clothes you wore when you came? Now you have woolen trousers, crisp shirts, and shiny leather shoes. When you are treated in the hospital, the state pays for your medical expenses. When you have economic difficulties, the trade union subsidizes you. Your family has an average monthly income of 20 yuan per person. You really don't know how lucky you are!" Next to the big-character poster was an illustration of a young man covering his eyes with his hands and standing under a lush tree, full of fat, socialist fruits, while he was sighing alone.

This painting is well done

Another interesting cartoon aroused Chairman Mao's interest. This painting depicted a person wearing an extremely long pair of trousers. It turned out that this was because someone had complained that his salary was too low, only enough to buy one trouser leg, while in fact, his salary was 56 yuan per month, enough to buy several bolts of cloth. So the author of this cartoon humorously asked him in the big-character poster: "How long is your trouser leg exactly?" Chairman Mao smiled and said to the Party Secretary Xia Zhengyan beside him: "This painting is well done, very interesting."

How are the cadres who are being criticized?

Many big-character posters criticized the ideology and work style of some leading cadres in the factory. The workers criticized some cadres for not going deep into their work, "only hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but not seeing anyone coming down"; some cadres for "enjoying before suffering, and suffering after enjoying"; and some cadres for having a bad attitude towards the workers, "like a master"... Although some of these big-character posters were worded sharply, most were well-intentioned and correct. Chairman Mao pointed to a big-character poster that criticized the factory director and party secretary by name and said: "This big-character poster is very well written." After a while, he asked the party secretary and factory director with concern: "Have the cadres who have been criticized raised their heads now?" Comrades Xia Zhengyan and Huang Zonglin replied that the vast majority of party cadres in the factory had adopted a correct attitude, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, and were actively "rectifying and correcting at the same time."

In fact, the big-character posters had already answered the question that Chairman Mao was concerned about. The big-character posters of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory had a special column that promptly reported to the masses on the progress of improving work, and the workers loved to read this column the most. Not long ago, the workers had criticized some leading cadres in the big-character posters for living in too many houses. A few days later, it was reported here that Vice-Factory Director Li Guangfu had accepted the opinions of the masses and decided to vacate a quarter of his housing. After reading it, the workers immediately wrote another big-character poster, giving him praise. Recently, the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory had improved a lot of work according to the opinions of the masses, such as improving the poor quality of cotton yarn production in the Nantex workshop, adding bathing facilities needed by the workers, repairing a road that used to be flooded, organizing an inspection team to inspect the canteen work, and improving the food. These things were all reported in the big-character posters, and the workers all said: "Such rectification is really good."

Good news spreads throughout the factory

This large flower bed with luxuriant flowers and trees was also mixed with some wildflowers and poisonous weeds. Chairman Mao stopped again in front of a big-character poster entitled "Gleanings from Rectification" and looked at it carefully for a while. This was written by a fleeing landlord who had sneaked into the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. In this big-character poster, this bad element who had sneaked into the ranks of the working class and refused to be reformed viciously launched an almost comprehensive attack on the Party, slandering the new Party members as "dirty goods," the old Party members as having deteriorated, and the promotion of cadres as "emphasizing virtue over talent," and so on. Although this bad element fabricated a false name and tried his best to cover up his reactionary true face with some obscure words, as soon as this big-character poster was posted, the workers immediately smelled its anti-socialist odor. Within a few days, dozens of big-character posters were posted refuting him, listing facts from various aspects to prove that his words were completely bloody and slanderous rumors.

Chairman Mao walked along the factory's walkway, went around a circle, and returned to the front of the office building. At this time, the good news that "Chairman Mao is here!" had spread throughout the factory, and it happened to be when the middle shift workers were getting off work. Ecstatic workers poured out of the workshop like a tide. More and more workers gathered around Chairman Mao, and countless people stretched out their enthusiastic hands to him. Several textile female workers and reporters squeezed together in the crowd, always trying to squeeze to the front to see clearly. A female worker had tears of gratitude rolling in her eyes, repeatedly saying: "Too happy, too good, Chairman Mao still has time to come to the factory to see us workers." Obviously, Chairman Mao could no longer read the big-character posters, so he stopped and waved to the workers again and again, thanking the worker brothers for their warm welcome. Finally, he left the factory with the workers' reluctant farewells.

After Chairman Mao left, the workers gathered again in front of the big-character posters to read them, especially the several big-character posters that were praised by the chairman, which more people read. In the afternoon, many new big-character posters appeared on the factory walkway, which foreshadowed that the factory's great debate was moving towards a new climax. (Attached picture)

Chairman Mao went deep into the grassroots in Shanghai to inspect the rectification and the situation of the big blooming and great contending. On the morning of September 18, Chairman Mao went to the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory to view the big-character posters posted by the workers.

    毛主席看大字报
    本报记者　季音、习平
    百花盛开的花圃
    18日上午，几辆小汽车驶进了上海国营第一棉纺织厂的大门，在办公楼前的小广场上卡的一声停下了。车门开处，穿着灰色制服、身体健壮的毛主席，和一群客人一齐走了下来，他们是特地到这里来看大字报的。
    毛主席一下车，迎面看到的就是贴满在走道两旁的大字报。看来大字报至少有两、三千张，从厂门口到南纺工场几十米长的走道两边，都被贴得密密层层，走道的边上，还支架着许多临时用来张贴大字报的木板。从这一片热闹的景象中，一眼就可以看出，这个工厂的整风运动正开展得挺热火。毛主席环顾周围的情景，脸上泛起了愉快的笑容，随即由两个主人——国棉一厂的党委书记和厂长陪着，走到了大字报的前面，一张张的看了起来。
    展开在毛主席面前的一大片大字报，真像是一座百花盛开的花圃，那样的生气蓬勃。这里有对党的工作和一些党员干部思想作风的批评，有对国家政治生活中肯的论述，有对各种工作的建议，也有对各种错误意见的尖锐的论争。大字报的形式更是活泼多样，图文并茂。有幽默的漫画，辛辣的讽刺诗，有顺口溜和快板，有短小的论文，有专对某一问题的调查报告，还有有趣的短剧和对话，……这几千张琳琅满目的大字报，是上海国棉一厂几千个工人的集体创作，它不只是充分地表露着工人们的才华，并且充分地表现了工人们高度的政治积极性。
    大辩论的第一枪
    毛主席第一张看到的是一群老工人写的大字报，这是他们在一个老工人座谈会上的发言。老工人们对工厂的党和行政提了不少意见。另外，他们又着重的提出，他们不同意有些大字报上的错误言论，比如有人说现在是“国富民穷”，有人说“拍马屁的人都得到了提拔”“农民的生活太苦”等等。老工人们认为这些大是大非问题，大家一定要争个明白。这张大字报是国棉一厂目前正在展开的全厂大争辩的第一枪。
    老工人们在大字报上争辩得最热烈的一个问题是生活问题。有一个姓唐的青年工人在大字报上埋怨他的工资太少，说他“在黄连树下过生活。”老工人和他在大字报上展开了争论，他们指出，这个青年工人从1951年进厂以后，工资每年都有增加，1951年他初进工厂时工资就有四十元，去年已调整到五十六元五角，一家三人，平均每人有近二十元的生活费。大字报写道：“唐学根啊，你想想来时穿的什么衣服？现在毛货裤子，笔挺的衬衫，雪亮的皮鞋。你在医院里治病，国家给你支付药费。经济有困难，工会给你补助。你家平均每人每月有二十元收入，你真是身在福中不知福！”大字报边上，还有一幅插图，画着一个青年人用手蒙着眼站在一棵枝叶茂盛的大树下，树上结满了肥大的社会主义的果实，而他却独自在那里唉声叹气。
    这幅画画得好
    另一幅有趣的漫画引起了毛主席的兴趣。这幅画画着一个人穿着一条其长无比的裤子。原来这是因为有一个人曾提意见说，他的工资太少，只够买一只裤脚管，而实际上他的工资每月五十六元，足足可以买几匹布。于是这位漫画的作者在大字报上幽默地问他：“你的裤脚管到底有多长呢？”毛主席微笑着对身边的党委书记夏正言说：“这画画得很好，很有意思。”受到批评的干部怎样？
    有不少大字报是批评厂内一些领导干部的思想和工作作风的。工人们批评有的干部工作不深入，“只见楼梯响，不见人下来”；有的干部“享乐在前，吃苦在后”；有的干部对工人态度不好，“像个老爷”，……这些大字报，有的虽然措词尖锐，但大多数是善意和正确的。毛主席指着一张指名批评厂长和党委书记的大字报说：“这张大字报写得很好。”一会儿，他又关怀地问党委书记和厂长：“受到批评的干部现在是不是已抬起了头来？”夏正言和黄宗林同志回答说，厂内的绝大多数党员干部都采取了正确的态度，虚心倾听群众的意见，并且正在积极地“边整边改”。
    大字报上其实也已经回答了毛主席所关心的这个问题。国棉一厂的大字报上专门有一栏，及时地向群众报道改进工作的一些情况，工人们最爱看这一栏。不久前，工人们曾在大字报上批评了有些领导干部住的房子太多。几天之后，这里就报道说：副厂长李光甫接受群众的意见，决定腾出住房的四分之一。工人们看了后，立即又写了一张大字报，给予表扬。国棉一厂在最近已根据群众的意见改进了许多工作，例如改进了南纺工场棉纱生产质量不好的缺点，增设了工人需要的洗澡设备，修理了一条过去时常浸水的道路，组织检查组检查了食堂工作，改进了伙食。这些事，都在大字报上作了报道，工人们都说：“这样的整风真是好。”
    喜讯传遍全厂
    这座花木繁盛的大花坛里，也夹杂着一些野花和毒草。在一张题为“整风拾零”的大字报前，毛主席又停住了，仔细看了一会。这是混入国棉一厂的一个逃亡地主写的，在这张大字报上，这个混入工人阶级队伍、不接受改造的坏分子，恶毒地对党几乎进行了全面的攻击，诬蔑新党员是“肮脏货”，老党员变了质，提拔干部是“重德轻才”，等等。虽然这个坏分子捏造了一个假名字，并且竭力地用一些隐晦的字眼来遮盖他反动的真面目，但当这张大字报一贴出，工人们立即就嗅出了它反社会主义的气味，几天之内，就贴出了几十张反驳他的大字报，从各个方面列举事实，证明他的话完全是含血喷人的恶毒造谣。
    毛主席沿着工厂的走道，走了一圈，重新回到办公楼前。这时候，“毛主席来了！”的喜讯已传遍了全厂，又正逢中班工人下班，狂喜的工人们像潮水似地从车间里涌出来，围聚在毛主席周围的工人愈来愈多，无数的人把热诚的手伸向他。好几个纺织女工和记者一起在人群里挤着，总想挤到前面看个清楚，一个女工眼里滚动着感激的眼泪，连连说：“太幸福啦，太好啦，毛主席还有空到工厂里来看我们工人。”显然，毛主席已没法再看大字报了，他便停下来，向工人们一再挥手致意，感谢工人弟兄们对他的热诚欢迎。最后，他在工人们恋恋不舍的欢送下，离开了工厂。
    毛主席走了之后，工人们又重新聚集在大字报前读了起来，特别是受到主席称赞的几张大字报，看的人更多。下午，工厂走道上又出现了许多张新的大字报，它预示着全厂的大辩论正在走向一个新的高潮。（附图片）
