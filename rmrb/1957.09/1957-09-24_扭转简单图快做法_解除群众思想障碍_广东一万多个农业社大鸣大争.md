Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 23rd: Currently, the first batch of over 14,000 agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province have launched extensive airing of views and great debates.

Among these 14,000-plus cooperatives, some have conducted the airing of views relatively well. From the outset, they focused on dispelling the concerns of cadres and members, explaining the purpose of the extensive airing of views and great debates, and encouraging cadres, Communist Party members, and members to participate together. During the airing of views process, they repeatedly persuaded activists not to rush into the great debates. As a result, not only did poor and lower-middle peasants raise many reasonable opinions and express some confused ideas, but upper-middle peasants also boldly exposed their thoughts. According to a survey by the Tiaoshu Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhanjiang, 95% of the members attended the airing of views meetings, and 86% of adult members expressed their opinions at the meetings. Because these cooperatives aired their views more thoroughly, they created favorable conditions for further great debates.

However, some cooperatives failed to achieve extensive airing of views. In terms of guiding ideology, the work teams in these cooperatives failed to distinguish between the different nature of this movement and the previous period’s struggle against the counter-offensive of unlawful landlords and rich peasants; some cadres were also afraid that extensive airing of views would cause chaos. Therefore, they were eager to find targets for struggle from the beginning, or they assigned topics for airing of views, not allowing members to go beyond the scope, and they were quick to refute members' erroneous opinions. This approach caused concern among the members and led the movement astray.

In mid-September, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in response to the problems in the movement, once again instructed party committees at all levels to use all means to prevent various simplistic and hasty practices, emphasizing that the key issue at present is to eliminate the ideological obstacles of cadres, to enable the masses to fully express their views first, and repeatedly pointing out the purpose and steps of the movement. According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, party committees at all levels have successively convened cadre meetings to further clarify the guiding ideology. At present, the above-mentioned simplistic and hasty practices have been reversed.

### 扭转简单图快做法　解除群众思想障碍  广东一万多个农业社大鸣大争

    扭转简单图快做法　解除群众思想障碍
    广东一万多个农业社大鸣大争
    新华社广州23日电　广东省目前已经有第一批一万四千多个农业社开展大鸣大放大争。
    这一万四千多个社中，有一部分社鸣放得较好。它们一开始就着重解除干部和社员的顾虑，讲明大鸣大放大争的目的，让干部、共产党员和社员一起鸣放。在鸣放过程中又反复说服积极分子不急于大争。因此，这些社不仅贫农和下中农提出了许多合理的意见，讲出了一些糊涂看法，就是上中农也大胆地暴露了自己的思想。据湛江市郊调熟社的调查，有95％社员参加了鸣放会议，有86％的成年社员在会上发表了意见。这些社鸣放得比较透彻，就为进一步的大争创造了有利条件。
    但是，还有一些社没有做到大鸣大放。这些社的工作队在指导思想上分不清这次运动和前一时期对不法地主、富农的反攻倒算进行斗争具有不同的性质；有的干部还怕大鸣大放会引起混乱。因此一开始就急于找斗争对象，或者指定鸣放题目，不准社员超越范围，当社员一提出错误的意见便急于反驳。这样的做法，使社员产生了顾虑，使运动走了弯路。
    9月中旬，中共广东省委会针对运动中的问题，再次指示各级党委要用一切办法防止各种简单图快的做法，强调当前的关键问题是消除干部的思想障碍，使群众先尽情鸣放起来，并且反复指出了运动的目的和步骤。根据省委指示，各级党委已陆续召开干部会议，进一步明确指导思想。目前上述简单图快的做法已经得到扭转。
