Xinhua News Agency report from Jakarta: The Indonesian National Consultative Conference entered the group discussion stage on the morning of September 12th.

The establishment of four subcommittees to discuss relevant issues was the result of the National Consultative Conference held on the evening of the 11th. The four issues to be discussed by the groups are military affairs, civil administration, "National Vigilance," and special issues. Special issues include the cooperation between President Sukarno and former Vice President Hatta, as well as the West Irian issue.

The conference decided to concentrate the discussion of military issues in a meeting attended only by military personnel. This military issues subcommittee is chaired by the Minister of Defense, with Sukarno participating as Supreme Commander, in addition to the Chiefs of Staff of the three armed forces and Hatta participating in a civilian capacity.

Jakarta newspapers revealed on the 12th that in the past two days of meetings, Bali’an, the commander of the Second Military Region from South Sumatra, continued to insist on opposing the central government's position, demanding the dissolution of the current cabinet and its replacement with a presidential cabinet led by Hatta. The heads of the three "committees" that launched coups in Central, South Sumatra, and Sulawesi expressed similar views to Bali’an on some issues.

According to reports, senior military officers from Jakarta and Central Java attending the Consultative Conference expressed a clear attitude of upholding the purpose of the Consultative Conference. In their speeches, they criticized the actions of the various "committees." Representatives from many regions also expressed opinions consistent with the central government in their speeches.

There was no formal meeting on the morning of the 13th, only a subgroup of the subcommittee discussing military issues held a meeting. The National Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to end on the 12th, but it may now be postponed to the 15th.

On the 13th, many Indonesian newspapers focused on the issue of cooperation between Sukarno and Hatta.

　　印度尼西亚协商会议有进展
    设立四个小组委员会讨论有关问题
    本报综合报道  据新华社雅加达讯：12日上午印度尼西亚全国协商会议进入分组讨论的阶段。
    设立四个小组委员会来讨论有关的问题，这是全国协商会议在11日晚间举行的会议上的收获。由小组讨论的四个问题是军事、民政、
  “民族警惕”和特殊问题。在特殊问题中包括有苏加诺总统和前副总统哈达的合作问题以及西伊里安问题。
    会议决定把军事问题集中到只有军人参加的会议中去讨论，这个军事问题的小组委员会由国防部长主持，苏加诺以最高统帅身份参加，此外有三军参谋长和以平民身份参加的哈达。
    12日雅加达的报纸透露，在这两天的会议中，来自南苏门答腊的第二军区司令巴利安在发言中仍然坚持反对中央的立场，要求解散现内阁，而代之以哈达领导的总统制内阁。分别在中、南苏门答腊和苏拉威西发动政变的三个“委员会”的首脑在一些问题上表示了与巴利安相同的见解。
    据报道，出席协商会议的雅加达和中爪哇的高级军官表示了维护协商会议的宗旨的明确态度。他们在发言中批评了各个“委员会”的行动。许多个地区的代表在发言中也表示了和中央一致的意见。
    13日上午没有举行正式会议，只有讨论军事问题的小组委员会所属的一个小组在开会。全国协商会议原订在12日结束，现在可能延期到15日。
    13日许多印度尼西亚报纸把注意力集中在苏加诺和哈达的合作问题上。
