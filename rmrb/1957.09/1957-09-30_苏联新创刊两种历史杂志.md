    USSR Launches Two New History Magazines
    The History Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences has launched two new history magazines this year, and the inaugural issues have already been published.

    "History of the USSR"
    "History of the USSR" is the official publication of the History Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, edited by M.P. Kim, and published six times a year.
    In the inaugural editorial, the editorial board stated that one of the journal's main tasks is to continuously improve the level of scientific research of Soviet historians, while also forcefully combating bourgeois historical viewpoints. To accomplish this task, the editorial board called on historians to strictly adhere to the Party spirit principle of Marxist-Leninist historical science, while also overcoming dogmatism.
    "History of the USSR" will regularly raise various historically significant issues within the country for discussion, publish important historical materials from various periods, review important works on Soviet history research by domestic and foreign historians, and report on the research situation of Soviet history.
    The first issue published seven articles, three of which studied the history of the Soviet period, and four of which studied the history of pre-revolutionary Russia.
    In addition to essays, reports, book reviews, foreign research on Soviet history, and scientific activities occupy one-sixth of the inaugural issue. The "Foreign Research on Soviet History" column includes reviews and introductions of foreign publications related to Soviet history, as well as reviews of Soviet historical works published abroad.

    "Modern and Contemporary History"
    "Modern and Contemporary History" is also edited by the History Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, with A.A. Guber, an expert in Oriental history, as the editor-in-chief, and is published six times a year.
    The inaugural issue published an editorial entitled "For Creative Research on Modern and Contemporary History," which explained the journal's purpose. The editorial pointed out that in recent years, reactionary imperialist forces have attempted to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the 20th Congress of the CPSU's criticism of the cult of personality and dogmatism to launch a major offensive against socialist camp countries, national liberation movements, and progressive forces in capitalist countries; in the ideological sphere, they distort history, attempting to replace Marxism with revisionism. Because ideological struggle cannot be conducted using rigid formulas, historians must strengthen their Bolshevik Party spirit and use science to oppose bourgeois ideology. After reviewing the achievements of Soviet historical science over the past forty years, the editorial went on to list some shortcomings in the study of modern and contemporary history. In particular, it pointed out that in order to specifically expose and criticize the reactionary nature of bourgeois historiography, it is necessary to fully understand and study all the works of modern bourgeois historians. Therefore, one of the central tasks of "Modern and Contemporary History" is to scientifically critique foreign works on modern and contemporary history, while also distinguishing and utilizing valuable new contributions to science made by non-Marxist historians. To accomplish the above tasks, information and bibliography work should be strengthened. The magazine will pay special attention to systematic reviews and introductions of domestic and foreign books and periodicals, and the publication of important archival materials. In addition, there should be planned contact with progressive historians abroad, especially historians from socialist countries.
    The inaugural issue published for the first time ten letters between Engels and the Lafargue couple from 1871-1872. This material was provided by the Marxist-Leninist Institute of the Central Committee of the CPSU and was not included in the first volume of the French publication "Correspondence between Engels and the Lafargue Couple." This material is of great significance for studying the struggle between Marx, Engels, and the anarchists in the late First International.
    In addition to the editorial and the newly published materials, the magazine's content is divided into four columns: essays, reports, book reviews and catalogs, and scientific activities. The inaugural issue contains six essays, one report, five book reviews, and fourteen new book introductions. In addition, there are two indexes: "Index of Works on Modern and Contemporary History by Soviet Historians Published in 1956" and "Index of Materials and Essays on Modern and Contemporary History Published in Soviet Publications in 1956." Finally, there is a short article written by the editorial board in memory of Academician Pankratova. (Han, Zhi)

### 苏联新创刊两种历史杂志

    苏联新创刊两种历史杂志
    苏联科学院历史研究所今年新创办了两种历史杂志，创刊号都已经出版。
    “苏联历史”
    “苏联历史”是苏联科学院历史研究所的机关刊物，由м·п·基姆主编，每年出版六期。
    编辑部在创刊词中说明这个刊物的主要任务之一，就是不断地提高苏联史学家们科学研究工作的水平，同时给资产阶级的史学观点以有力的打击。为了完成这一任务，编辑部号召史学家们严格遵守马克思列宁主义历史科学的党性原则，同时必须克服教条主义。
    “苏联历史”将经常提出本国历史上的各种有现实意义的问题进行讨论，登载各个时期的重要史料，评论国内外史学界关于苏联史研究的重要著作，报道苏联历史的研究情况。
    第一期发表了七篇论文，三篇是研究苏维埃时期的历史，四篇是研究革命前俄国的历史。
    除论文外，报告、书评、国外对苏联史的研究、科学活动等栏在创刊号中占了六分之一的篇幅。国外对苏联史的研究一栏，包括对外国出版的有关苏联史著作的评论和介绍，以及国外对苏联出版的历史著作的评论。
    “近代和现代史”
    “近代和现代史”也由苏联科学院历史研究所编辑，总编辑是东方史专家А·А·古柏尔，每年出版六期。
    创刊号以“为了创造性的研究近代和现代史”为题发表社论，说明了这个刊物的宗旨。社论指出，近年来帝国主义反动势力企图利用苏共二十次代表大会批评个人崇拜和教条主义的机会，对社会主义阵营的国家，对民族解放运动，对资本主义国家的进步力量大举进攻；在意识形态方面歪曲历史，企图以修正主义偷换马克思主义。由于意识形态的斗争不能用死板的公式，历史学家必须加强布尔什维克党性，通过科学来反对资产阶级思想。社论回顾过去四十年来苏联历史科学的成就后，接着列举近代现代史研究方面的一些缺陷。特别指出，要具体揭露批判资产阶级史学的反动性，必须充分了解研究现代资产阶级历史学家的全部著作。因此，“近代和现代史”的中心任务之一就是科学地批判国外近代和现代史的著作，同时区别和利用非马克思主义历史学家对科学作出的新的有价值的贡献。为了完成以上任务，应加强情报和目录学工作。杂志将特别注意国内外书刊的系统评介，和重要档案材料的刊印。此外，应和外国进步史学家、特别是社会主义国家史学家作有计划的联系。
    创刊号首次刊印了恩格斯和拉法格夫妇在1871—1872年间的来往信札十封，这部分材料是由苏共中央马列主义学院所供给，没有刊入法国出版的“恩格斯和拉法格夫妇通讯集”第一卷中。这部分材料对于研究马克思、恩格斯在第一国际末期和无政府主义者的斗争有重大意义。
    除社论和初次刊印的资料外，杂志内容分四栏：论文、报告、书评和目录、科学活动。创刊号刊载六篇论文、一篇报告、五篇书评和十四篇新书介绍。此外，还有索引两种：“1956年出版的苏联历史家关于近代现代史的著作索引”和“1956年苏联刊物上发表的关于近代现代史的资料和论文索引”。最后刊载一篇编辑部为悼念潘克拉托娃院士所写的短文。　（涵、芝）
