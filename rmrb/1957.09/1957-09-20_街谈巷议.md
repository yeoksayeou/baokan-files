　　Street Talk
　　Big-character posters
　　One after another
　　Full of ink fragrance
　　Inspect the work
　　Help our Party
　　Remove the sludge
　　Like wiping a lathe
　　Once a day
　　Always polished bright
　　(Wang Lishuan, Beijing Printing Factory)
　　By the Swimming Pool
    Li Huizhong, a rightist commander stirring up trouble at the Anshan Daily, suddenly thought of swimming not long ago, so he happily came to the swimming pool.
    When he presented his "swimming certificate," the staff discovered Li Huizhong's name and asked him in surprise, "Are you Li Huizhong from the Anshan Daily?" He had no choice but to admit it. Thereupon, the workers and students in line shouted angrily, "Don't sell him a ticket! Don't let him pollute the water in the swimming pool!" Everyone stared at him. He dared not protest, nor dared to defend himself, so he lowered his head, parted the crowd, and quietly slipped away.

　　One Dime
    I bought a catty of old corn in the morning for my child, a dime a catty. I paid with a twenty-cent note and left with my basket. The rain was too heavy, and I was in a hurry to go home, completely forgetting that I was supposed to get a dime back. After walking a few steps, the young peasant selling corn caught up with me and stuffed a dime, already soaked with rain, into my hand. I thanked him, and he smiled and said, "We're liberated now, it's not like before, everyone has to be honest."
    This sentence made me think for a long time. Before liberation, as soon as wages were paid, we rushed to exchange them for silver dollars, otherwise, they would be worthless in a few days. Before going out in the morning, we had to exchange for silver dollars to buy groceries. The silver exchange market and the small vegetable market were both in front of my house. As soon as it dawned, there was a cacophony of clanging sounds and shouts. In the small vegetable market, buying a catty of meat might only get you ten ounces, a stack of banknotes could disappear in the blink of an eye, and vegetable prices could rise several times a day. Buying groceries was like fighting a battle. Now, all of this has vanished like smoke. This one dime is enough to illustrate today's reality. "We're liberated now, it's not like before!" A corn-selling peasant can also answer the rightists' lies: is the present worse than the past, or is the present better than the past? (Liang Zhao, Duolun Road, Shanghai)

　　街谈巷议
　　大字报
　　一张一张
　　满院墨香
　　检查工作
　　帮助咱党
　　清除污泥
　　像擦车床
　　一天一次
　　总要擦亮

　　游泳池边
    鞍山日报有一位兴风作浪的右派主帅李惠众，前不久忽然想起要游泳，就高高兴兴地来到游泳池。
    他交验“游泳证”的时候，工作人员发现李惠众的名字，就惊奇地问他：“你就是鞍山日报的李惠众吗？”他只好答应。于是，排着队的工人和学生一起愤怒地喊起来：“别卖票给他！别叫他弄脏了游泳池的水！”大家盯着他，他既不敢抗议，又不敢分辩，只好低头分开人群，悄悄地溜走了。

　　一角钱
    早晨买菜回来，给孩子带了一斤老玉米，一角钱一斤，我付了一张两角票，提着篮子就走了。雨下得太大，我急着要回家，根本忘记了还要找回一角钱。走了几步，卖玉米的青年农民追上来了，把一张已被雨水淋湿的一角钱塞给我。我向他道谢，他笑笑说：“解放啦，现在不比从前啦，大家都要老老实实的。”
    这句话使我想了很久。解放前，一发工资就赶快都兑成银元，否则，几天工夫就会一钱不值了。早晨出门，要先兑换银元再去买菜，兑换银元的市场和小菜场都在我家门口，天刚亮，就是一片叮叮当当的声音和吆喝声。在小菜场上，买一斤肉也许只有十两，一叠钞票会不翼而飞，菜蔬能一天涨几回价，买小菜就跟打仗一样。现在，这一切全都烟消云散了。这一角钱就足以说明今天的现实。“解放啦，现在不比以前啦！”一个卖玉米的农民也能回答右派分子的谎话：究竟今不如昔，还是今胜于昔？　（上海多伦路梁昭）
