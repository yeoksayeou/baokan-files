　　The Only Path to Develop Science and Technology in Our Country
　　Xu Jie, Deputy Minister of Geology

　　While launching attacks in all directions, the rightists extended their clutches into the science and technology community, which was advancing along the socialist road. In the name of the Science Planning Group of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, they openly put forward so-called "Several Opinions on Issues Related to the Scientific System in Our Country." In this regard, President Guo Moruo of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other scientists have sternly refuted them, pointing out that it is a thoroughly anti-socialist program for scientific work. The rightists' attack on the scientific community and the scientists' response to them is a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road in our country's scientific work.

　　What is the difference between the two roads of scientific work? The vast majority of scientists in our country can correctly answer this question based on their own experiences. Many scientists were engaged in scientific work both before and after liberation. Under the oppression of reactionary rule before liberation, the road that scientific work could take was only the capitalist road. More precisely, it was the semi-colonial road under the control and influence of foreign capitalism through the domestic reactionary regime. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the political consciousness of scientific workers has been increasing day by day, and scientific work has changed course and embarked on the socialist road.

　　As a geological worker, I would like to use the different situations of geological work in our country before and after liberation to illustrate the difference between these two roads. As everyone knows, one of the characteristics of geological work in our country before liberation was that it was far removed from the national economy and the people's livelihood and divorced from reality. The reactionary rulers never seriously used geological science for production and construction, so that geological workers could only proceed from their personal interests of "science for science" for a long time. At that time, the work of geologists was basically limited to "armchair theorizing," and could not be tested and promoted by the actual production and construction. Another characteristic of geological work in our country before liberation was a state of freedom and anarchy. Geological work across the country was carried out in a decentralized manner by local geological units, without unified planning. Under the bad influence of reactionary rule and old social customs, the small number of people in the geological community were divided into separate factions, uncoordinated with each other, and even jealous of each other. Due to the existence of the above characteristics (actually the most serious shortcomings), geological science did not receive due development in old China for a long time.

　　After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party, fundamental changes have taken place in geological work in our country. One of the characteristics of this change is that geological science serves socialist construction and is closely integrated with it. The large-scale geological exploration work carried out nationwide has provided huge mineral resources for national economic construction, and at the same time, it has promoted the development of new technologies and new methods, constantly enriched scientific theories, and promoted the advancement of scientific research, making geological science in our country step out of the narrow field of the past and enter a stage of comprehensive development. Another characteristic of geological work in our country after liberation is that geological work across the country has been gradually incorporated into a unified plan. Work is arranged in a focused and step-by-step manner according to the current and long-term needs of the country and the priorities of tasks. To this end, manpower and material resources have been appropriately concentrated, and various geological professionals have been trained. The rapid growth of the geological team, the continuous improvement of geological workers in practical exercises, and the expansion of survey and research areas in the short years after liberation are far beyond what could have been compared before liberation.

　　In summary, in semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, geological work imitated capitalist countries and took the capitalist road, resulting in geological science stagnating for a long time. After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, geological work in our country entered the socialist road, and thus geological science in our country has flourished.

　　In fact, the different roads and their different consequences experienced by other scientific work in our country before and after liberation are roughly similar to the situation of the above-mentioned geological work before and after liberation. From this example, we can see the two completely different situations of scientific work in our country before and after liberation.

　　In the anti-socialist program for scientific work put forward by the rightists, they never mentioned that scientific work should serve socialist construction. On the contrary, they advocated that scientific work should not be planned, should not have priorities, and should be carried out in a decentralized and spontaneous manner. This is actually to make scientific work detached from the needs of national construction. Obviously, if the absurd proposition of the rightists were allowed to succeed, the scientific community in our country would be dragged back to the old road of old China, and the scientific cause in our country would turn from the current vigorous development to stagnation and withering; and the scientific workers themselves would be guided away from the broad prospects of serving production and construction, and would once again fall into the bleak situation of confining scientific work to a few people's armchair theorizing and helplessness as before liberation!

　　In order to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, the rightists vainly attempted to use the means of stealing the sky and changing the sun to make scientific work in our country leave the socialist track, so as to weaken and eliminate the socialist cause in our country. Once their conspiracy was exposed, the broad masses of scientific workers, like the people of all other sectors of the country, were incomparably angry.

　　But why did the rightists dare to attack the scientific community and put forward an anti-socialist scientific program without any scruples? This is because our scientific community still has certain weaknesses, which make them think that there is an opportunity to take advantage of. That is to say, to this day, some scientists in our scientific community are still not accustomed to the principles of scientific work under the socialist system, and the erroneous ideas and views arising therefrom are a weak link that the rightists may be able to use.

　　From this, it can be seen that we should deeply realize from the current anti-rightist struggle that scientific workers in our country must, under the leadership of the Party, continue to conscientiously carry out self-education and self-transformation, so as to continuously improve their socialist consciousness. The current anti-rightist struggle is the best socialist education. All scientists who support socialism must actively participate in this struggle together with the broad masses of people to completely smash the conspiracy of the rightists to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. Only in this way can our scientific work, which we have worked hard for many years, continue to advance smoothly on the bright road of socialism with the development of the country's socialist construction.

### 发展我国科学技术的唯一道路

　　发展我国科学技术的唯一道路
　　地质部副部长　许杰
    右派分子在向各方面进攻的同时，曾把他们的魔爪伸进了正在沿着社会主义道路前进的科学技术界，他们假借民盟中央科学规划小组的名义，公开提出了所谓“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”。关于这一点，科学院郭沫若院长及其他科学家们已严正地予以驳斥，并指出它是一个彻头彻尾的反社会主义的科学工作纲领了。右派分子向科学界的进攻及科学家对他们的回击，是我国科学工作的社会主义道路与资本主义道路的斗争。
    科学工作的两条道路有什么不同呢？我国绝大多数科学家是可以根据亲身的经历来正确地回答这个问题的。很多科学家解放前后都是从事科学工作的，解放前的科学工作在反动统治的压迫下，所走的道路只能是资本主义的道路。更确切地说，是在外国资本主义通过国内反动政权的控制和影响之下的半殖民地的道路。解放以来，在中国共产党领导下，科学工作者的政治觉悟日益提高，科学工作已改弦更张，走上了社会主义的道路。
    作为一个地质工作者，我愿意以解放前后我国地质工作的不同情况来说明这两条道路的不同。大家知道，解放前我国地质工作的特点之一，是远离国计民生，是脱离实际的。反动统治者从来也没有认真地把地质科学利用于生产建设，使地质工作者在过去很长时期内只能从“为科学而科学”的个人兴趣出发去进行工作。当时地质家的工作基本上被局限于“纸上谈兵”，得不到生产建设的实际考验和推动。解放前我国地质工作的另一特点，是自由散漫的无政府状态。全国地质工作是由各地质单位分散进行，没有统一的规划。在反动统治和旧社会风气的恶劣影响下，人数很少的地质界，是各立门户，互不协调，甚至互相嫉视。由于存在以上特点（实际上是最严重的缺点），至使地质科学在旧中国经过很长时期得不到应有的发展。
    解放后在党的英明领导下，我国地质工作有了根本性的转变。这种变化的特点之一是：地质科学为社会主义建设服务并与之密切相结合。在全国范围内所展开的大量的地质勘探工作，为国家经济建设提供了巨大的矿产资源，同时更促进了新技术、新方法的发展，并不断地充实着科学理论，推动着科学研究的前进，使我国地质科学走出了过去狭小的领域而进入全面发展的阶段。解放后我国地质工作的另一特点是：全国地质工作已逐步纳入统一计划，根据国家当前与长远的需要及任务的轻重缓急，有重点有步骤地布置工作，并为此适当地集中了人力物力，培养了各种地质专业人材。解放后的短短几年，地质队伍的迅速壮大，地质工作者在实际锻炼中的不断提高，调查研究地区的扩展，都远非解放前所可比拟。
    概括说来，在半封建、半殖民地的旧中国，地质工作模仿资本主义国家，走资本主义的道路，其结果是使地质科学在很长时期处于停滞状态。解放后在中国共产党领导下，我国地质工作进入了社会主义的道路，因而我国地质科学有了蓬勃发展。
    事实上我国其他各门科学工作在解放前后所经历的不同的道路及其不同的后果，是与上述地质工作在解放前后的情况大致相似的，从这一个例子我们可以看出我国科学工作在解放前后的两种完全不同的情况。
    右派分子在所提出的反社会主义的科学工作纲领中，绝口不提科学工作应该为社会主义建设服务，相反地，却主张科学工作不要计划，不要重点，要分散地、自发地进行。这实际上就是要使科学工作脱离国家建设的需要。很明显，假如让右派分子的荒谬主张得逞，我国科学界就要被拖回到旧中国的老路上去，我国科学事业就会由现在的蓬勃发展而转趋于停滞和萎缩；而科学工作者本身，就会被引导到离开为生产建设服务的广阔前途，重新陷于像解放前那样把科学工作局限于少数人纸上谈兵、一筹莫展的凄惶境地！
    右派分子为着反党、反社会主义，妄图以偷天换日的手段，使我国科学工作离开社会主义的轨道，以便其削弱和取消我国的社会主义事业。其阴谋一经揭穿，广大的科学工作者，和全国其他各界人民一样，是无比愤怒的。
    但右派分子为什么敢于向科学界进攻，并毫无顾忌地提出了一个反社会主义的科学纲领呢？这是因为我们科学界目前还存在着一定的弱点，使他们认为有隙可乘。这就是说，至今我们科学界，还有部分科学家仍然不习惯于社会主义制度下的科学工作的原则，以及由此而产生的错误想法和看法，这些正是右派分子有可能加以利用的一个薄弱环节。
    由此可见，我们应该从当前的反右派斗争中深刻地认识到：我国科学工作者必须在党的领导之下，继续认真地进行自我教育和自我改造，以不断提高自己的社会主义的觉悟。当前的反右派斗争是一次最好的社会主义的教育，一切拥护社会主义的科学家，必须和广大人民一起，积极参加这一斗争，以彻底粉碎右派分子反党、反社会主义的阴谋。只有这样，我们多年努力的科学工作，才能在社会主义的光明大道上随着国家社会主义建设的发展而继续顺利前进。
