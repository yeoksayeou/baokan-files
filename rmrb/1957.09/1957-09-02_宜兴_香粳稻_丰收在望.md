    宜兴“香粳稻”丰收在望
    被誉为“一亩稻香飘十里，一家煮饭十家香”的江苏宜兴县香粳稻，现在正在扬花吐穗，生长良好，丰收在望。
    宜兴县今年香粳稻的种植面积比去年扩大了两倍多。目前，香粳稻正在与同伴争艳夺美，周围的中、晚粳稻还在圆秆拔节的时候，它已经扬花吐穗，飘撒着芬香的花粉。为了鼓励种植香粳稻的农民的生产积极性，粮食部门特以高出一般粳稻20％的收购价格，准备收购即将出产的名稻。
    香粳稻在全国农业展览会展出后，引起了全国各地的注意。宜兴县人委农业科先后收到全国各地的来信三十多封。为了满足各地的要求，该县已分别寄赠了一些稻种。今年香粳稻已经在四川、河南、江西、福建、安徽、浙江、广东、广西等地繁殖生长。
