　　Jiangsu Prepares Large Quantities of Base Fertilizer for Autumn Planting
　　Liaocheng Prefecture Actively Prepares Seeds and Farm Tools

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Agricultural cooperatives in Jiangsu Province are launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign to prepare base fertilizer for autumn planting and strive for increased production next year.

    Taking advantage of the gap before the autumn harvest, the Zhenjiang Prefecture mobilized 800,000 people to cut grass for green manure and collect miscellaneous fertilizers, which is enough base fertilizer for 3.5 million mu of autumn-sown fields. It is estimated that by the time of autumn planting, more than 90% of the prefecture's 7.2 million mu of autumn-sown fields will be able to apply base fertilizer. In the Suzhou and Songjiang Prefectures in the Taihu Lake area, where there is more late rice, the fertilizer accumulation campaign is being carried out in conjunction with late rice topdressing. In the three districts of Liantang, Guli, and Zhitang in Changshu County, more than 1,700 boats have been dispatched to harvest aquatic plants, and 22,800 people have been put into cutting green grass. The fertilizer accumulated by agricultural cooperatives in these areas not only solves the shortage of topdressing for late autumn crops, but also makes good preparations for base fertilizer for autumn planting. In the Yancheng and Yangzhou Prefectures, where there is more early and mid-season rice, agricultural cooperatives have made reasonable arrangements for the three agricultural tasks of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and fertilizer accumulation, ensuring that none are neglected.

    This newspaper reports that agricultural cooperatives in Shandong's Liaocheng Prefecture are stepping up preparations for wheat planting. The entire region plans to sow 10 million mu of wheat, requiring 1.5 to 2 carts of base fertilizer per mu.

    Preparations for seeds and farm tools have also received early attention. Agricultural cooperatives in Linqing County have universally inspected and turned over the existing 6.69 million jin of seeds, and some have undergone germination tests. The prepared seeds amount to 12 jin per mu, which can meet the needs of close planting. To ensure timely sowing, stubble removal and moisture conservation have also been carried out in various places.

    In their autumn planting preparations, the agricultural cooperatives here specifically calculated the time, tasks, fertilizer, labor, and animal power, overcoming the paralyzing thought that it was "not too late." Then they formulated wheat planting plans.

　　江苏为秋播准备大量底肥
　　聊城专区积极准备种子和农具
    新华社讯　江苏省各地农业社展开积肥运动，为秋播准备底肥，争取明年增产。
    镇江专区利用秋收前空隙，发动八十万人割草压的绿肥和拾的杂肥，已足够三百五十万亩秋种田的底肥。预计到秋种前，全专区七百二十多万亩秋种田，90％以上都能施底肥。太湖流域苏州、松江晚稻较多的两个专区，积肥运动是与晚稻追肥结合进行的。常熟县练塘、古里、支塘等三个区，已出动一千七百多只船捞水草，有二万二千八百多人投入割青草。这些地区农业社积的肥料，既解决了晚秋作物缺的追肥，又为秋播作好了底肥准备。在早熟与中熟稻较多的盐城、扬州两个专区，各农业社把秋收、秋耕、积肥三项农活作了合理安排，作到了三不误。
    本报讯　山东聊城专区农业社正在加紧进行种麦准备工作。全区计划播种小麦一千万亩，要求每亩施底肥一车半到两车。
    种子、农具的准备工作，也都及早注意了。临清县各农业社已将现存的六百六十九万斤种子普遍进行了检查、翻晒，部分经过发芽试验。所备种子每亩合到十二斤，可满足密植需要。为保证适时下种，各地还进行了灭茬保墒。
    这里的各农业社在秋种准备中，具体算了时间、任务、肥料和劳力、畜力，克服了“晚不了”的麻痹思想。然后制定了种麦计划。
