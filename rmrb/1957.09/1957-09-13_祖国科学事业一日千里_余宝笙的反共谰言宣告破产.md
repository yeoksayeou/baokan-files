The motherland's scientific undertakings advance by leaps and bounds
Yu Baosheng's anti-Communist slanders declared bankrupt

　　This newspaper reports that Yu Baosheng, the director of the scientific research department of Fujian Normal College (a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), was originally a female general under Zhang Bojun. Born into a family of despotic landlords and subjected to a long period of enslaving education in an imperialist missionary school, she has always harbored deep-seated hatred for the Communist Party and the people's revolutionary cause.

　　In her speech at the Provincial People's Congress, Yu Baosheng openly denied the Party's leadership over science and denied the achievements of scientific research over the past eight years since liberation. She frantically clamored that at the current stage, because the Party does not understand science, it cannot lead in science and technology. Many professors refuted Yu's reactionary arguments. Professor Ding Hanbo said that before liberation, there were only about 40 scientific research institutions in the country, but now there are more than 170; the number of scientific research personnel has also increased from about 600 before liberation to tens of thousands now, and the funding for scientific research has also increased year by year. In particular, the heavy water atomic reactor with a power of 7,000 kilowatts and the α-particle cyclotron capable of producing 25 million electron volts are under construction, which are powerful evidence that the Party can lead science.

　　Yu Baosheng had close contacts with Li Shuzhong (chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party) and Huang Zhen (vice-chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), who were Zhang Bojun's backbone and rightist elements in Fujian. According to revelations, she went to Beijing three times this year to have secret talks with Zhang Bojun.

　　祖国科学事业一日千里
　　余宝笙的反共谰言宣告破产
    本报讯　福建师范学院科学研究部主任的余宝笙（农工党员），原来是章伯钧手下的一名女将。她出身于恶霸地主家庭，长期受着帝国主义教会学校的奴化教育，对共产党、对人民革命事业一向抱有刻骨的仇恨。
    余宝笙在省人代会上的发言里面，公开否认党对科学的领导，抹煞解放八年来科学研究的成就。她疯狂叫嚣说：目前阶段由于党还不懂得科学，因此在科学技术上是不能领导的。许多教授对余的反动论点纷纷进行了驳斥。教授丁汉波说，解放前全国科学研究机构只有四十个左右，现在则有一百七十多个；科学研究人员也由解放前的六百人增加到现在的数以万计，而科学研究经费也年年增加。特别是功率为七千瓩的重水型原子反应堆，和能产生二千五百万电子伏的∝粒子回旋加速器正在兴建，这些都是党能领导科学的有力证据。
    余宝笙与章、罗在福建的骨干、右派分子李述中（农工民主党福建省主委）、黄震（农工民主党福建省副主委）来往密切。据揭发，她今年曾三次去北京与章伯钧密谈。
