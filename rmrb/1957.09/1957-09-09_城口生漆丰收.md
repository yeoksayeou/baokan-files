	Abundant Harvest of Chenkou Raw Lacquer

	Chenkou County, Sichuan Province, which is rich in raw lacquer, has organized more than 1,500 lacquer tappers from various agricultural cooperatives to go up the mountains to collect raw lacquer since the end of May. By the end of July, they had generally entered the second round of tapping (each lacquer season has seven rounds, and a lacquer tree usually only has one lacquer season every seven years). This year, due to more sunny days and less rain, it is suitable for lacquer juice to flow down the tree. Many agricultural cooperatives have also promoted the advanced lacquer tapping method created by Huang Zhengde, a lacquer tapping expert in the county. The quality and quantity of raw lacquer have generally improved compared to previous years. According to Lanxi Township, each tapper will collect twenty catties more raw lacquer than last year. Calculated on the basis of each tapper collecting only one hundred catties of raw lacquer, the county can produce more than 1,530 dan, an increase of more than 13.5% compared to last year, which had the highest output in history.

	The raw lacquer produced in Chenkou County has a fragrant smell, bright color, and quick solidification. Except for the color being second only to Maoba lacquer in Hubei, its quality in other aspects is the best in the country.

	In order to develop lacquer resources, the county has cultivated more than 800,000 saplings in recent years, equivalent to 38% of the original lacquer forest. (Zhang Youfu)

    城口生漆丰收
    盛产生漆的四川省城口县，从5月下旬起，各农业社就组织了一千五百多名割漆匠上山采割生漆，到7月底为止，已普遍进入第二轮刀（每个漆季割七轮，一棵漆树一般要七年才逢一个漆季）。今年由于天气多晴少雨，适合漆汁下树，许多农业社又推行了该县割漆能手黄正德创造的先进割漆方法，生漆的质和量一般都比往年提高。据岚溪乡了解，每把刀（即每个人）将比去年多割二十斤生漆。全县以每把刀只割生漆一百斤计算，即可产一千五百三十多担，比历史上产量最高的去年还增加13.5％以上。
    城口县的生漆气味香、颜色鲜、凝固快，除色泽仅次于湖北茅坝漆外，其他方面的品质都冠于全国。
    该县为了发展漆源，近年来，全县已培育了八十多万株幼树，相当于原有漆林的38％。（张优富）
