    Ku Klux Klan Castrates Black Man
    In Birmingham, Alabama, USA, on the evening of September 2, Ku Klux Klan members barbarically mutilated a 33-year-old unmarried Black man named Judge Aaron by cutting off his genitals.
    A group of Ku Klux Klan members in two cars encountered Aaron walking on the highway. They took him to a garage and knocked him unconscious. While Aaron was unconscious, the Klansmen used a shaving razor to cut off his genitals.
    Aaron has been hospitalized for treatment. He said that the Ku Klux Klan members threatened him to go back and tell the Black community that any Black parents who plan to send their children to white schools will be punished in this way.

    三K党阉割黑人
    美国亚拉巴马州伯明翰的三K党徒9月2日晚上用割掉生殖器的野蛮办法残害了一个名叫贾冶·阿隆的三十三岁的未婚黑人青年。
    一批三K党徒分乘二辆汽车在公路上碰到正在走路的阿隆，他们就把他带到一个汽车房，并且把他击昏。三K党徒在阿隆昏迷期间用剃胡子的刀片割掉了他的生殖器。
    阿隆已经被送进医院治疗，他说，这些三K党徒当时威胁他回去转告黑人，凡是打算把孩子送进白人学校的黑人家长都将受到这种处罚。
