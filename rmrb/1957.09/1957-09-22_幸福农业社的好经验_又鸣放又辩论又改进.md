    Good Experiences of the Happiness Agricultural Cooperative
    Airing Views, Debating, and Improving
    (Our dispatch) The Happiness Agricultural Cooperative in Dayingtan Township, Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, gained an experience during the socialist education campaign: it is necessary to simultaneously air views, debate, and improve. If improvements are not made in a timely manner, it will affect the airing of views. Originally, after some problems were raised in this cooperative, the township and cooperative cadres did not pay attention to solving them for a while, and some members were dissatisfied, saying, "It's useless to offer opinions." The township and cooperative cadres and the work team, based on this situation, classified and sorted out the problems raised by the masses. Regarding the issues raised by the masses concerning cadres' undemocratic leadership and failure to rely on poor and lower-middle peasants, they conducted self-criticisms at different meetings. Regarding the issues of poor management and unclear rewards and punishments within the cooperative, which were most discussed by the members and could be resolved quickly, they seized the opportunity to resolve them. For example, the serious rate of miscarriage among mares in the No. 1 and No. 2 teams were addressed by appropriately criticizing and demanding compensation from the feeders whose feeding and drinking were improper and members whose use of the mares was excessive, based on the seriousness of the circumstances. Combined with the clearing of work and accounts, more than 2,700 unreasonable work points were reduced. After many practical problems within the cooperative were resolved, the members were very satisfied and actively participated in the great debate on grain issues. Member Lü Fengming said, "It looks like the opinions raised this time are being addressed, let's join the meeting!" Many people went from not actively participating in the debate to actively participating, turning the debate on grain issues into a daily central topic for all members.

    幸福农业社的好经验
    又鸣放又辩论又改进
    本报讯　河北省张北县大营滩乡幸福农业社，在进行社会主义教育中得到一条经验：必须边鸣放、边辩论、边改进，如不及时改进，就会影响鸣放。这个社原先有些问题提出后，乡社干部一时没有注意解决，部分社员就不满地说：“提意见也是白提。”乡社干部和工作组根据这个情况，把鸣放出来的问题进行了分类排队。对群众提出的有关干部领导不民主和不依靠贫农、下中农等问题，分别在不同的会议上进行了检讨。对待社内经营管理不善、赏罚不明等社员议论最多，且能迅速解决的问题，就抓紧解决。譬如：一、二队母马流产严重，则根据饲养员喂饮不当和社员使役过度的情节轻重，适当地进行了批评和赔偿。结合清工清账，对不合理的工分缩减了两千七百多个。社内许多实际问题得到解决后，社员十分满意，积极参加了粮食问题大辩论。社员吕凤鸣说：“看样子这次提了意见有下落，快参加会吧！”许多人由不积极参加辩论到积极参加，使粮食问题的辩论变成了全体社员日常的中心议题。
