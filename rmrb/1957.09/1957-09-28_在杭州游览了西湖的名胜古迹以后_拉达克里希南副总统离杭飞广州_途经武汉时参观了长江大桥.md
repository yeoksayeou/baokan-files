Vice President Radhakrishnan said at the banquet that this ten-day visit was an unforgettable experience for him. He also congratulated the Chinese people on embarking on prosperity and strength under the leadership of the government that serves the people.

Before the Vice President spoke, Vice Governor Chen Rutang extended his heartfelt greetings to Vice President Radhakrishnan, who had visited Guangzhou twice, in his speech.

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, who accompanied the Vice President to Guangzhou on a special trip, also expressed his regret at the Vice President's upcoming departure from our country.

Invited to attend tonight's banquet were Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru and his wife, as well as other distinguished Indian guests who accompanied the Vice President on his visit to China. Also present were Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou, and responsible persons from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City. Heads of consulates of various countries in Guangzhou were also present.

Vice President Radhakrishnan arrived in Guangzhou at 6:02 p.m. today from Hangzhou via Wuhan on a special plane. Responsible persons and generals from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City welcomed the distinguished guests at the airport in the autumn rain.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 27th – Accompanied by Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Indian Vice President Dr. Radhakrishnan flew from Hangzhou to Guangzhou by special plane at 9:00 a.m. today.

At 11:05 a.m., the plane arrived in Wuhan. Accompanied by Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, and Wang Kewen, Acting Mayor of Wuhan, who came to welcome him, Vice President Radhakrishnan went to the Yangtze River Bridge by car. On the bridge's road surface, the Vice President inquired about the bridge's length, construction time, and engineering cost. Peng Min, Director of the Bridge Engineering Bureau, gave a detailed answer. Then, he walked to the railway bridge surface from the bridgehead fort staircase on the Hanyang side, and took photos with Zhang Tixue, Peng Min, and others. When the Vice President walked onto the road surface again, hundreds and thousands of voluntary laborers who participated in the cleaning work gathered to applaud him repeatedly to express their welcome. When leaving the Yangtze River Bridge, Vice President Radhakrishnan accepted the commemorative album "Construction of Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge" presented by Peng Min and signed it as a souvenir.

Vice President Radhakrishnan also watched a schematic model of the "Comprehensive Development Prospect of the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River" at the "Hubei Provincial Agricultural Exhibition Hall" today.

After having lunch with Governor Zhang Tixue and others, Vice President Radhakrishnan left Wuhan for Guangzhou at 3:00 p.m.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou – On the 26th, Dr. Radhakrishnan, Vice President of the Republic of India, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Sha Wenhan, Governor of Zhejiang Province, toured the scenic spots and historical sites of West Lake.

Hangzhou is now in the season of fragrant osmanthus and crisp autumn air. In the morning, Vice President Radhakrishnan visited the Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory and climbed the Qiantang River Bridge for a panoramic view. Facing the green hills and clear waters, Vice President Radhakrishnan said to Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, who accompanied him, "Poet, I hope to see your poems depicting this beautiful scenery tomorrow."

Vice President Radhakrishnan also visited Lingyin Temple in the morning. The monks in the temple, wearing cassocks, greeted the distinguished guests with their palms together. Vice President Radhakrishnan also greeted them with his palms together. Accompanied by Dharma Master Xingkong, the distinguished guests visited the Great Hall of the Great Hero, which is 45 meters high, and a 25-meter-high statue of Sakyamuni that is being installed. Vice President Radhakrishnan was very interested in Feilai Peak (Flying Peak) opposite Lingyin Temple. Legend has it that this peak flew from India more than 1,800 years ago, and it is exactly the same as the Vulture Peak in India. To this day, there is still a plaque with the inscription "Lingjiu Flew Here" in the main hall of Lingyin Temple.

In the evening, Vice President Radhakrishnan mentioned Feilai Peak again at the banquet held by Sha Wenhan, Governor of Zhejiang Province. He said: The friendship between China and India today stands as firmly as this Feilai Peak. He raised his glass to toast the friendship between China and India. He also hoped that Vice Chairman Guo Moruo would write a few more poems to depict the scenery of West Lake, which has already been depicted by many poets. Vice Chairman Guo Moruo immediately recited a poem he wrote on the spot:

    A mountain flew from India in the past,
    Taking root between West Lake in Hangzhou,
    This mountain has added to the beauty of West Lake,
    This mountain shows the long history of Sino-Indian friendship.

    Today, an even higher mountain has flown from India,
    This mountain's name is Radhakrishnan.
    Although this mountain is about to fly back to India,
    We want to weave it into Hangzhou brocade,
    In this way, this mountain will not only remain in Hangzhou forever,
    But also spread throughout the world.

    For the happiness and safety of mankind, I hope this mountain will remain in the world forever.

    在杭州游览了西湖的名胜古迹以后

    途经武汉时参观了长江大桥
    新华社广州27日电　广东省副省长陈汝棠今晚设宴招待印度共和国副总统拉达克里希南博士。
    拉达克里希南副总统在宴会上讲话说，这次长达十天的访问，是他不可忘怀的经历。他还祝贺中国人民在为人民服务的政府领导下走上繁荣富强。
    在副总统讲话前，陈汝棠副省长在致词中对两次来到广州的拉达克里希南副总统表示衷心的问候。
    专程陪同副总统来到广州的全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若也为副总统的即将离开我国表示惜别。
    应邀出席今晚宴会的有印度驻华大使拉·库·尼赫鲁夫妇以及随副总统来中国访问的其他印度贵宾。出席作陪的还有广州市市长朱光以及广东省、广州市各界负责人。各国驻广州领事馆负责人也出席作陪。
    拉达克里希南副总统是在今天下午六时二分自杭州乘专机经武汉来到广州的。广东省、广州市的负责人和将军在这下着秋雨的傍晚到机场欢迎贵宾。
    据新华社27日讯　印度副总统拉达克里希南博士在郭沫若副委员长陪同下，今天上午九时从杭州乘专机飞往广州。
    上午十一时五分，飞机到达武汉。拉达克里希南副总统在前来欢迎的湖北省省长张体学、武汉市代市长王克文陪同下，乘车前往长江大桥。在大桥公路桥面上，副总统询问了桥的长度、建筑时间、工程成本等情况。大桥工程局局长彭敏详细地作了答复。接着，他由大桥汉阳岸桥头堡楼梯走到铁路桥面上，和张体学、彭敏等一起摄影留念。当副总统再次走上公路桥面时，在这里参加清理工作的成百上千的义务劳动者，聚集前来一再向他鼓掌表示欢迎。离开长江大桥时，拉达克里希南副总统接受了彭敏赠送的“武汉长江大桥工程建设”纪念册，并签字留念。
    拉达克里希南副总统今天还在“湖北省农业展览馆”里观看了“长江中游综合开发远景”示意模型。
    拉达克里希南副总统在和张体学省长等共进午餐后，在下午三时离开武汉前往广州。
    据新华社杭州电　印度共和国副总统拉达克里希南博士，26日在全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若和浙江省省长沙文汉陪同下游览了西湖的名胜古迹。
    杭州现在正是桂花飘香、秋高气爽的季节。上午，拉达克里希南副总统参观了都锦生丝织厂，并且登上钱塘江大桥远眺。拉达克里希南副总统面对这青山绿水，对陪同他游览的郭沫若副委员长说：“诗人，希望明天就能看到你描绘这美丽景色的诗篇。”
    拉达克里希南副总统上午还参观了灵隐寺。寺中的和尚穿着袈裟合十迎接贵宾，拉达克里希南副总统也合十致意。在性空法师的陪同下，贵宾们参观了高达四十五公尺的大雄宝殿和正在进行安装的一座二十五公尺高的释迦牟尼像。拉达克里希南副总统对灵隐寺对面的飞来峰感到极大的兴趣，这座山峰传说在一千八百多年以前是从印度天竺飞来的，它与印度的灵鹫峰一模一样。迄今在灵隐寺大殿上还有一幅“灵鹫飞来”的匾额。
    晚上，拉达克里希南副总统在浙江省省长沙文汉举行的宴会上又提到了飞来峰。他说：中印友谊今天就像这座飞来峰一样巩固地矗立起来了。他举杯为中印友谊干杯。他还希望郭沫若副委员长再写几首诗来描绘已经有许多诗人描写过的西湖景色。郭沫若副委员长当即朗诵自己即席写的一首诗：
    从前从印度飞来了一座山，
    落根在杭州西湖之间，
    这座山增加了西湖的美丽，
    这座山表现了中印友谊的悠远。
    今天，从印度又飞来了更高的一座山，
    这座山的名字叫拉达克里希南。
    这座山虽然又要飞回印度，
    可是我们要把它织成杭州的锦缎，
    这样，这座山不仅能永远留在杭州，
    而且要向世界传遍。
    为了人类的幸福和安全，希望这座山永远留在人间。
