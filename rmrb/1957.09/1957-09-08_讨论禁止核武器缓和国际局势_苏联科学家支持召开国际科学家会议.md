Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 7th: More than a thousand Soviet scientists gathered at the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow on the 6th, demanding a ban on the use and cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the immediate convening of an international scientific conference to discuss the prohibition of testing and production of these weapons of mass destruction.

Among those attending the meeting were prominent scholars such as Nesmeyanov, Skobeltsyn, Lysenko, and Oparin. More than ten scientists spoke at the meeting.

Academician Skobeltsyn said at the meeting that the resolution of the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and eliminating the danger of a new war could no longer be delayed. He continued, saying that everyone is responsible for the world situation, and scientists can be said to have a greater responsibility than people in any other profession. The particularly acute question facing them is for what purpose the fruits of their labor, the achievements of scientific progress, are used.

Soviet pediatrician Academician Speransky emphasized in his speech that atomic and hydrogen weapon tests should be stopped for the sake of the next generation and for the happiness of children. He said that whenever he sees in the newspaper that the enemies of peace are preparing for war, he first thinks of the children.

History Professor Kosminsky said that scientific workers from all countries should strive to make science serve the happiness of mankind. He said that the social opinion of millions of people is a force more powerful than the atomic bomb.

The conference finally passed a resolution requesting scientists from all countries to more resolutely strive for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and to ensure that intercontinental rockets are only used for the purposes of scientific progress. The resolution also supported the call from within the Soviet Union and internationally for a broad international conference of scientists, so that scientists could freely discuss and take joint action against the threat of atomic war and strive to ease international tensions.

    斯科贝尔琴院士在会上说，禁止原子武器和消除新战争危险的问题的解决不能再拖延了。他接着说，人人都对世界局势有责，科学家可以说负有比任何职业的人更大的责任，摆在他们面前的特别尖锐的问题是，他们的劳动成果，科学进步的成果被用于什么目的。
    苏联儿科专家斯佩兰斯基院士在发言中特别强调指出，为了下一代，为了孩子们的幸福，应该停止原子武器和氢武器的试验。他说，每当我在报纸上看到和平的敌人在准备战争的时候，我首先想到的是孩子们。
    历史学教授科斯明斯基说，世界各国科学工作者应该努力使科学为人类的幸福服务。他说，千百万人的社会舆论是比原子弹威力更强大的力量。
    大会最后通过决议，要求各国科学家更加坚决地争取禁止原子武器和氢武器，使洲际火箭只用于科学进步的目的。决议并且支持苏联国内和国际上要求召开广泛的国际科学家代表会议的呼声，以便科学家自由讨论和采取共同行动，反对原子战争威胁，争取缓和国际局势。
