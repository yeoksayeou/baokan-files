Oppose the Restoration of Bourgeois Social Science
Jin Yuelin

The characteristic of proletarian social science lies in the close integration of its party spirit and its scientific nature. Its party spirit leads to its scientific nature, and its scientific nature strengthens and enriches its party spirit. Only the proletariat dares to face the development of society squarely, only by facing the development of society squarely can we scientifically reflect the laws of social development, and only by scientifically reflecting the basic laws of social development can we have true social sciences in specific departments. A class that does not dare to face or is unwilling to face the laws of social development cannot have true social science. The bourgeois social science that the rightists want to restore is not true social science. Although bourgeois social scientists have mastered some raw materials, and indeed have some knowledge, and reflect some facts, their social science is still not true science. They fundamentally cannot reflect the basic laws of social development.

Proletarian social science openly admits that it has party spirit. Does bourgeois social science also have party spirit? Of course it does, and it manifests in quite a few forms, but it conceals its party spirit. It seems to only have "scientific" nature. How do bourgeois social scientists disguise it as science? What runs through the entire bourgeois social science is its objectivism. Objectivism and objective viewpoints are completely different things. We must never confuse them. The objective viewpoint is a pragmatic viewpoint, a materialist viewpoint, which we must adhere to. Objectivism is a party spirit that conceals its position. Although bourgeois social scientists are engaged in class struggle, they do not recognize antagonistic classes, do not recognize class struggle, and do not recognize class standpoints. For them, people are said to have no class standpoint. Capitalist society is a society ruled by the bourgeoisie. Whose standpoint is this seemingly neutral standpoint? Under bourgeois rule, in the midst of sharp struggles with the bourgeoisie, a detached, non-aligned stance serves the bourgeoisie, because it obscures the line between the enemy and ourselves for the working people and weakens the struggle. Objectivism is this position that pretends to be neutral but in essence serves the bourgeoisie. Some social scientists in capitalist society may be unconsciously serving the bourgeoisie, but their role and influence remain the same. In post-liberation China, social scientists among the old intellectuals know that bourgeois social science has a party spirit like objectivism. To restore bourgeois social science is to restore the party spirit of the bourgeoisie in social science.

On the other hand, there is the pseudo-scientific nature of bourgeois social science. This is also inseparable from its party spirit. Why have bourgeois scholars been able to sell pseudo-science as true science? They have always passed off objectivism as an objective viewpoint. It has already been pointed out above that objectivism is not an objective viewpoint, it cannot lead to true science, it is actually anti-science. It is inseparable from idealism, especially subjective idealism. The latter can be said to be the theoretical foundation of the former. If you ask a bourgeois social scientist what the basis of his conclusion is, he will say "facts." If you ask further, some of them will say that so-called "facts" are personal direct experience, and direct experience is sensory experience. Of course, they will not be satisfied with their own direct experience, they will also cite the direct experience of Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li...etc., and also do statistics, but the final answer is still the direct experience of each individual. I have personally asked this, and I have personally received this answer. The answer stops at this point, their philosophy is Berkeley and Hume's subjective idealism. Others are different, they will stop at "facts." If you ask further, they will say: that is a philosophical question, that is a matter for you philosophers, not for us social scientists. To stop at so-called "facts" without making a materialist explanation is still objectivism, this is just carrying objectivism through to basic viewpoints such as materialism and idealism. This is still idealism. Everyone has a worldview. Either the dialectical materialist worldview controls him, or various kinds of idealism or metaphysics control him. To ignore the worldview is to not accept dialectical materialism. At the same time, this is also accepting the idealist or metaphysical worldview. Bourgeois social science and metaphysical ways of thinking are equally inseparable. The result is that bourgeois social scientists cannot distinguish between the phenomena and essence of things, the accidental and necessary connections of things; some of them will come up with many numbers, which can derive the average rate of certain phenomena, or cite probability to express certain trends; however, they cannot discover the basic laws of social development. Since even this main thing cannot be obtained, how can bourgeois social science become science?

I used to engage in bourgeois political science. I taught a lot of classes, and I read a lot of books. The books were mostly large tomes, which looked intimidating, but contained nothing. Bourgeois political scientists dare not face the development of society squarely, nor dare they face politics squarely. Although they themselves participate in fierce class struggles, they dare not admit class struggle. Therefore, they dare not admit that the state is the ruling machine of the ruling class. If this point is not admitted, the problem cannot be scientifically raised, let alone scientifically solved. The discussion of the problem becomes a deceptive affair. Power and freedom is one such problem, it is said to be a problem of the relationship between the rulers and the ruled, as if the greater the power of the government, the less freedom the "people" have, and conversely, the more freedom the "people" have, the smaller or narrower the scope of the government's power. In fact, this is a contradiction between different groups or different strata within the bourgeoisie. It has nothing to do with the ruled class. The proletariat and the broad masses of working people have no freedom, and the bourgeois regime has no restrictions. The so-called sovereignty is also such a problem. There are all kinds of discussions about all kinds of questions about sovereignty, and these discussions are also deceptive. In fact, in capitalist countries, sovereignty is the unlimited power of the bourgeois dictatorship. Bourgeois political science is almost entirely the research and discussion of such issues. Because the class essence of these issues is hidden by objectivism, bourgeois political scientists can circle around and around on these issues, Zhang San writes a book, Li Si writes a book, seemingly researching and discussing freely, but in fact their role is only to confuse major issues of right and wrong, to mislead the direction of the working people, and to paralyze the fighting will of the working people. Is such political science science?

The so-called social sciences include quite a few specific sciences. Each department must reflect the specific laws of development in one field in order to become a science. No social science can be separated from the basic laws of social development. The laws of each department are closely combined with these basic laws. Historical materialism is the science that elucidates the basic laws of social development. To deny this science is to dig up the scientific foundations of specific departments of social science. Bourgeois social science fundamentally does not recognize historical materialism, and fundamentally does not recognize the basic laws of social development. Therefore, none of them can become specific sciences. They are all pseudo-sciences. Is this too much negation? I don't think it's excessive at all. The political science mentioned above is a good example. Please note that what is negated here is the scientific nature of bourgeois social science. Bourgeois scholars sometimes have similar negations, but this has nothing in common with what we are saying here. Their reasons are completely different from ours, they believe that social development cannot have science, this is agnosticism applied to society, this is a reactionary theory. We only negate bourgeois social science as science, we have never denied proletarian social science as science. Not only that, but we must also emphasize the party spirit of proletarian social science, its scientific nature, its importance, and study and enrich it to serve socialist construction.

The above points out the party spirit and pseudo-scientific nature of bourgeois social science. This does not mean that it has no materials or does not provide us with any knowledge about social phenomena. It has some materials, and it also provides us with some knowledge about social phenomena. We have always affirmed this point, but this affirmation is not simple. What exactly are the materials and knowledge of bourgeois social science is a very complex issue. There are raw materials, and there are also processed materials. Once the material is processed, party spirit is infiltrated into the material. Such material itself has the question of whether it is correct or not. Such material accounts for a large proportion of social science. Therefore, a large part of the "materials" of bourgeois social science have the party spirit of the bourgeoisie. Such "material" is not material at all, it is not correct in itself, and the "conclusions" derived from it cannot be correct. Fei Xiaotong's "Revisiting Jiangcun" has his so-called "materials." After the exposure by Comrades Zhou Shulian, Li Futong, and Zhang Siqian in the 15th issue of "New Observation" this year, we can say that he is looking for "materials" based on "conclusions." Can numbers that cannot be compared, but are forcibly compared, represent materials? Is it a scientific method to regard the average income of 1936 and 1956 as the same average income, regardless of the class content of the average income in 1936? Is the so-called "average income" after using this method material? The so-called "materials" in the "Revisiting Jiangcun" survey are "materials" that have inserted the general "conclusion" of "rural industry." That is to say, it is something that has been distorted by the infiltration of bourgeois party spirit. In short, the vast majority of the "materials" of bourgeois social science have the party spirit of the bourgeoisie. We must make Marxist-Leninist scientific processing of such "materials" to see whether there are any materials in them. For such "materials" we can only conduct thorough criticism, and cannot accept them in their entirety.

We also affirm that bourgeois social science also provides us with knowledge about social phenomena. But the "knowledge" that bourgeois social scientists want to sell is not simple. To master the materials is to have knowledge, but since the "materials" have problems, the "knowledge" also has problems. Knowledge is not just mastering the materials, but drawing conclusions from the materials. What "conclusions" do bourgeois social scientists draw? What "knowledge" do they have? Fei Xiaotong said in Chengdu: "What intellectuals care most about is how their knowledge is valued, whether it is appreciated and respected, this is more important than anything else to intellectuals, if an intellectual is undervalued, that is the most unbearable." According to him, the leadership did not give due valuation to the "knowledge" of intellectuals. Really not? Comrade Hu Sheng has already exposed Fei Xiaotong's typical "knowledge" in his speech. We can also look at Li Jinghan's "knowledge": "Cooperatives are not free. The meaning of this un-freedom can be understood but difficult to express... For example, if some members need to engage in a little household sideline, they may attract criticism, interference, or even be labeled as selfish and spontaneous... Members with a little extra money are often mobilized to 'consciously and voluntarily' invest, but some mutter behind their backs." "People think it was wrong to treat people as cattle and horses in the past, but today sometimes people are treated as tractors...". What is this? This is a lie that serves the reactionary class. This "knowledge" is anti-scientific, anti-people, and anti-socialist. I'll give another example: "...Under the private property system in the United States, two different incomes are generated, one is labor income, and the other is property income. The distance between the two ends of labor income in the United States is not large, for example, the average annual salary of manufacturing workers in the United States is two thousand three hundred and eight yuan, and the annual salary of the manager of DuPont Chemical Company in the United States is one hundred and seventy-five thousand yuan. After deducting income tax, the remaining is forty-eight thousand two hundred and fifty-one yuan. The distance between labor income in the United States is about twenty or thirty times... If the United States only has labor income, the society in the United States can be said to be very equal." This is something that is solemnly absurd, but this is Wu Jingchao's "scientific knowledge" before liberation. Fei Xiaotong should know the essence of such "knowledge" today after liberation. Despite this, he still wants to sell such "knowledge", why?

Fei Xiaotong said: The bourgeoisie's means of production are visible and tangible, and can be laid out, so they can be restricted and utilized... In a word, there is a way to deal with it. The "knowledge" of the old intellectuals is different, it is hidden in the mind, invisible and intangible, if they don't take it out themselves, others have no way to get it. That is to say, you have to buy it. It turns out that he wants to make "knowledge" generate "profit." This is not just a narrow, personal "profit." His own works already have a market in the United States and Britain. This "profit" is the "profit" of the reactionary bourgeoisie. There are three aspects to the "profit" of selling such "knowledge" to us: first, to spread poison, second, to rope in backward intellectuals to carry out "political" activities, and third, to attempt to formulate "policies" based on such "knowledge." To restore bourgeois social science is to restore capitalism.

In post-liberation People's China, in a China that is leaning towards socialism, in a China that is building socialism under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, in a China that has achieved great achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party, we do not want bourgeois social science, we do not want objectivism, we do not want pseudo-science, we do not want reactionary "knowledge." We want to move forward towards socialism and communism, not to return to the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China.

    反对恢复资产阶级的社会科学
    金岳霖
    无产阶级社会科学底特点在于它的党性和它的科学性是密切地相结合着的。它的党性导致它的科学性，它的科学性也加强和充实它的党性。只有无产阶级才敢正视社会底发展，只有正视社会底发展才能科学地反映社会发展底规律，只有科学地反映了社会发展底基本规律，才能有真正的具体部门的社会科学。不敢正视或不愿意正视社会发展规律的阶级是不能够有真正的社会科学的。右派分子所要恢复的资产阶级的社会科学不是真正的社会科学。尽管资产阶级的社会科学家们掌握了一些原始材料，也确实有些知识，也反映一些事实，但他们的社会科学仍然不是真正的科学。它们根本不能反映社会发展底基本规律。
    无产阶级的社会科学公开地承认它是有党性的。资产阶级的社会科学是不是也有党性呢？它当然有，而且表现的形式相当的多，不过它掩盖了它的党性而已。它好像只有“科学”性似的。资产阶级的社会科学家怎样把它伪装为科学呢？贯串着整个资产阶级社会科学的是它的客观主义。客观主义和客观的观点完全是两回事。我们决不能把它们混淆起来。客观的观点是实事求是的观点，是唯物主义的观点，它是我们所要坚持的。客观主义是掩盖立场的党性。资产阶级的社会科学家们虽然进行着阶级斗争，然而他们不承认对抗的阶级，不承认阶级斗争，不承认阶级立场。对于他们，人们被说成好像是没有阶级立场似的。资本主义社会是资产阶级所统治的社会。这个好像没有立场的立场是谁的立场呢？在资产阶级统治下，在和资产阶级作尖锐斗争的时候，超然的不要立场的立场就是为资产阶级服务的，因为它使劳动人民底敌我界限不清，斗争软弱。客观主义就是这个装着没有立场而实质上是为资产阶级服务的立场。资本主义社会里的社会科学家们当中有些也许是不自觉地为资产阶级服务，尽管如此，他们的作用和影响仍然一样。在解放后的中国，旧知识分子中的社会科学家们是知道资产阶级的社会科学有客观主义这样的党性的。恢复资产阶级的社会科学就是恢复资产阶级在社会科学中的党性。
    另一方面是资产阶级社会科学底假科学性。这也是和它的党性分不开的。资产阶级的学者为什么一直能够把假科学当作真科学贩卖呢？他们一直把客观主义冒充为客观的观点。上面已经指出客观主义不是客观的观点，它不能导致真正的科学，它实在是反科学的。它是和唯心主义，特别是主观唯心主义分不开的。后者可以说是前者的理论基础。如果你问一个资产阶级社会科学家他的结论的根据是什么？他会说是“事实”。如果再问的话，他们中间有些人就会说所谓“事实”就是个人的直接经验，而直接经验就是感官经验。他们当然不会满足于他们自己的直接经验，他们也要引用赵钱孙李……等的直接经验，并且还要作统计，但是最后的答案仍然是各个人的个人直接经验。我亲自这样地问过，也亲自得到过这样的答案。答案只在这一点上打住，他们的哲学就是巴克莱、休谟式的主观唯心主义。另外一些人就不同了，他们会在“事实”上打住。如果你再问的话，他们会说：那是哲学问题，那是你们哲学家的事，不是我们社会科学家的事。在所谓“事实”上打住，不作唯物主义的说明，仍然是客观主义，这只是把客观主义贯彻到唯物和唯心这样的基本观点上去了。这仍然是唯心主义。任何人都有世界观。不是辩证唯物主义的世界观掌握了他，就是各种各色的唯心主义或形而上学掌握了。他不理睬世界观就是不接受辩证唯物主义。同时这也是接受了唯心主义或者形而上学的世界观。资产阶级的社会科学和形而上学的思想方法是同样地分不开的。结果是资产阶级的社会科学家分辨不出事物底现象和本质，事物底偶然和必然的联系；他们中间有些人会搞出许多数目字来，可以得出某些现象的平均率，也可以引用或然率来表示某些趋势；但是，他们不能发现社会发展底基本规律。既然连这个主要的东西都得不到，资产阶级的社会科学怎么能够成为科学呢？
    我从前搞过资产阶级的政治学。课上的不少，书念的也很多。书大都是大部头的书，看起来可怕，但其中无物。资产阶级的政治学家不敢正视社会底发展，也不敢正视政治。虽然他们自己都参加激烈的阶级斗争，然而他们不敢承认阶级斗争。因此，他们也不敢承认国家是统治阶级底统治机器。这一点不承认，问题也就不能科学地提出，更不能科学地解决了。问题底讨论也就成为骗人的事情。权力与自由就是这样的问题之一，它被说成为统治者和被统治者底关系问题，好像是政府的权力愈大，“人民”的自由愈少，反过来“人民”的自由愈多，政府的权力愈小或权力的范围愈窄。其实，这是资产阶级中不同集团或不同阶层的矛盾。它和被统治阶级根本不相干。无产阶级和广大的劳动人民没有自由，资产阶级底政权也没有限制。所谓主权也是这样的问题。关于主权的各种各样的问题也有各种各样的讨论，而这些讨论也是骗人的。其实在资本主义国家里，主权就是资产阶级专政底无限制的权力。资产阶级的政治学差不多都是这种问题的研究和讨论。因为这种问题的阶级本质被客观主义隐蔽起来了，资产阶级的政治学家就能在这种问题上大绕其圈子，张三一本书，李四一本书，好像很自由地研究和讨论下去，其实他们的作用只是混淆大是大非来迷失劳动人民的方向，麻痹劳动人民的斗争意志而已。这样的政治学是科学吗？
    所谓社会科学包括好些门具体的科学。每一部门都要反映一个领域底具体的发展规律才能成为科学。任何社会科学都不能脱离社会发展底基本规律。各部门的规律是和这些基本规律密切地结合着的。历史唯物主义就是阐明社会发展底基本规律的科学，否认这一门科学就给具体部门的社会科学挖了科学的墙根。资产阶级的社会科学根本就不承认历史唯物主义，根本就不承认社会发展底基本规律，因此，它们都不能够成为具体的科学。它们都是假科学。这是不是否定得太多了呢？我认为一点都不过分。前面所说的政治学就是很好的例。请注意这里否定的是资产阶级社会科学底科学性。资产阶级的学者们有时也有类似的否定，这和我们这里所说的毫无共同之处。他们的理由和我们的完全两样，他们认为社会发展不能有科学，这是引用到社会上的不可知论，这是反动的理论。我们只否定资产阶级社会科学之为科学，我们从来就没有否定无产阶级社会科学之为科学。不但如此，我们还要强调无产阶级社会科学的党性，它的科学性，它的重要性，要研究它丰富它来为社会主义建设服务。
    上面指出资产阶级社会科学的党性和假科学性。这并不意味着它没有材料或对于社会现象不供给我们以任何知识。它有一些材料，对于社会现象也供给我们一些知识。这一点我们一直肯定，但是这个肯定并不简单。资产阶级的社会科学究竟有些什么材料和知识是一个很复杂的问题。有原始材料，也有加了工的材料。材料一经加工就有党性渗入到材料里面去了。这样的材料本身就有正确与否的问题。对于社会科学这样的材料占很大的比重。因此资产阶级社会科学底 “材料”有很大一部分是有资产阶级的党性的。这样的“材料”根本就不是材料，它本身既不正确，根据它得来的“结论”也就不可能是正确的。费孝通的“重访江村”中是有他的所谓“材料”的。经过周叔莲、李孚同、张思骞三同志在本年第十五期的“新观察”上的揭露，我们可以说他是根据“结论”去找“材料”的。不能对比，而又硬对比起来的数目字能代表材料吗？把1936年的和1956年的平均收入当作同样的平均收入看待，不管1936年平均收入中的阶级内容，是科学的方法吗？引用了这种方法后的所谓“平均收入”是材料吗？“重访江村”这一调查中的所谓“材料”是插入了“乡土工业”这个总“结论”的“材料”。这就是说它是有资产阶级党性渗入到里面去了的被歪曲了的东西。总而言之，资产阶级社会科学底“材料”绝大部分是有资产阶级的党性的。对于这样的“材料”我们要作马克思列宁主义的科学的加工，才能看出它究竟有没有材料在里面。对于这样的“材料”我们只能进行彻底的批判，不能全盘地接受。
    我们也肯定资产阶级的社会科学也供给我们关于社会现象的知识。但是资产阶级社会科学家所要贩卖的“知识”并不简单。掌握材料就是有知识，但是“材料”既然有问题，“知识”也就有问题。知识不只是掌握材料而已，是从材料中得出结论。资产阶级社会科学家得出一些什么“结论”呢？他们有什么“知识”呢？费孝通在成都时说：“知识分子最关心的是他们的知识如何被人估价，是否被人赏识和尊重，这对知识分子说来是比什么都重要的问题，如果对一个知识分子估价不足，那是最受不了的。”照他说，领导上对知识分子的“知识”没有给以应有的估价。真的没有吗？胡绳同志在他的发言中已经揭露了费孝通本人的典型的“知识”了。我们也可以看看李景汉的“知识”：“合作社不自由。这个不自由的含义是可以体会而难以言传的……例如有的社员需要搞点家庭副业，说不定会招来批评、干涉，甚至被扣上自私自利和自发的帽子……有点儿富裕钱的社员往往被动员‘自觉自愿’投了资，可是，有的却在背地里嘟囔着”。 “人们认为过去把人当牛马是不对的，而今天有时却把人当拖拉机用……”。这是什么呢？这是为反动阶级服务的谎话。这些“知识”是反科学反人民反社会主义的。我再举一个例：“……美国在私有财产制度下，产生两种不同的收入，一为劳务收入，一为财产收入。美国的劳务收入两端距离是不大的，例如美国制造业工人中年工资二千三百零八元，美国杜邦化学公司经理年薪十七万五千元。除去所得税剩下四万八千二百五十一元。美国劳务收入的距离大约二三十倍之间……假如美国只有劳务收入，美国的社会可以说是很平等的。”这是像煞有介事的荒谬绝伦的东西，可是这是吴景超在解放前的“科学知识”。费孝通对这样“知识”底本质在解放后的今天应该是知道的。尽管如此，他还是要贩卖这样的“知识”，为什么呢？
    费孝通说：资产阶级的生产资料是看得见摸得着的，可以摊出来的，因此是可以限制可以利用的……等等，一句话，应付它是有办法的。旧知识分子的“知识”就不同了，它藏在头脑里，看不见摸不着，自己不拿出来，别人是没有办法的。这就是说不买不行。原来他是要使“知识”生“利”的。这不只是狭隘的个人的“利”。他本人的作品在英美已经有了市场。这个“利”是反动的资产阶级的“利”。向我们推销这样的“知识”的“利”有以下三方面：一是散布毒素，二是网罗落后的知识分子来进行“政治”活动，三是企图根据这样的“知识”来制定“政策”。恢复资产阶级的社会科学就是要资本主义复辟。
    在解放后的人民中国，在倒向社会主义的中国，在马克思列宁主义指导之下来建设社会主义的中国，在共产党领导之下已经得到了伟大成绩的中国，我们不要资产阶级的社会科学，我们不要客观主义，不要假科学，不要反动的“知识”。我们要向社会主义共产主义前进，不要回到半封建半殖民地的旧中国去。
