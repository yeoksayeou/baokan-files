　　Railways, Highways, and Cart Roads Intersect
　　60% of Townships in Shanxi Province Accessible by Automobile or Train

　　(Our Report) A comprehensive transportation network composed of railways, highways, and cart roads has been formed in Shanxi Province.

　　In Shanxi Province, where mountainous areas account for 70% of the land, there were only a little over 1,200 kilometers of barely passable highways and 6,000 kilometers of cart roads in the early days of liberation. Coupled with years of disrepair and neglect, and war damage, the roadbeds were uneven, with sharp turns and steep slopes, and incomplete bridges and culverts. Traffic would be interrupted as soon as it rained or snowed. In many places, there were only narrow paths that were difficult to walk, and accidents involving injuries and deaths of people and animals occurred frequently. Since liberation, the state has invested more than 48 million yuan (including investment in purchasing additional vehicles), rebuilt and paved road surfaces totaling more than 2,100 kilometers, and built 4,600 kilometers of new simple highways and more than 700 large and small bridges. Now, the total length of highways that can be used in the province has reached more than 4,400 kilometers, and cart roads total 10,000 kilometers.

　　Now, all 95 counties in the province, except for Pinglu and Fenxi, are accessible by automobile or train. More than 1,800 of the province's 3,000+ townships are accessible by automobile or train.

　　In terms of inland river shipping, the blasting of reefs along 184 kilometers of the Yellow River, from Laoniu Bay in Pianguan to Heiyukou in Xingxian, has been completed. Trial navigation has now begun on the 76-kilometer section of the Fen River downstream from Jiangxian to Hejin. (Huang Deshu)

    铁路公路大车路纵横交错
    山西省60％的乡可以通汽车或火车
    本报讯　山西省以铁路、公路、大车路组成的四通八达的交通网已经形成。
    山岳面积占70％的山西省，在解放初期，勉强通车的公路只有一千二百多公里，大车路六千公里，加以年久失修，无人养护，又遭战争破坏，路基不平、弯急坡陡，桥涵不全，一遇雨雪，交通便中断了。有很多地方更是羊肠小路，很难行走，经常发生人畜伤亡事故。解放以来，国家已投资四千八百多万元
  （包括增购汽车投资在内），改建和铺筑路面的路线长达二千一百多公里，新建简易公路四千六百公里，大小桥梁七百多座，现在全省可以通车的公路已达四千四百多公里，大车路一万公里。
    现在全省九十五个县除平鲁、汾西两县外，都可通达汽车或火车。全省三千多个乡已有一千八百多个可以通汽车或火车。
    在内河航运方面，现已完成了黄河流域的偏关老牛湾至兴县黑峪口一百八十四公里的炸礁工程。汾河下游绛县至河津七十六公里的航运，现已开始试航。（黄德淑）
