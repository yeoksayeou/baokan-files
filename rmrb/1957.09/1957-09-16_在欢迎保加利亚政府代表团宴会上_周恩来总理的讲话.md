Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming the Bulgarian Government Delegation is as follows:

　　Respected Comrade Chairman Yugov,
　　Respected Comrades of the Bulgarian Government Delegation,
　　Comrades, Friends:

　　Today, with a feeling of great cordiality and pleasure, we gather here with our distinguished guests, the good friends of the Chinese people—Comrade Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and all the comrades of the Bulgarian Government Delegation. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades of the Bulgarian Government Delegation headed by Comrade Yugov.

　　The Bulgarian people are a heroic, industrious, and revolutionary people. Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government, the Bulgarian people have made unremitting efforts for the socialist construction of their country and have achieved great successes. In the short span of thirteen years, Bulgaria has transformed from an agricultural country into a country with modern industry and cooperative agriculture. The material and cultural living standards of the Bulgarian people are gradually improving with the development of the national economy. Now, they are working selflessly to complete and overfulfill Bulgaria's Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. We sincerely congratulate the fraternal Bulgarian people on their new and greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction.

　　The Bulgarian people have always been faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism. They have made important contributions to strengthening the friendly cooperation between socialist countries and consolidating the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In international affairs, the People's Republic of Bulgaria has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and has made great efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people fully support these efforts of the Bulgarian people and will continue to work with them to further strengthen the unity of the socialist countries and defend the great cause of world peace.

　　However, just as all peace-loving countries and people around the world are striving to further ease international tensions, the ruling circles of the United States are openly carrying out military threats in the Middle East and grossly interfering in Syria's internal affairs. This provocative action by the United States not only seriously violates the principles of the United Nations Charter, but also seriously threatens peace in the Middle East and the world. This unstable situation has aroused the utmost indignation and severe condemnation from Syria and other Arab countries, as well as peace-loving countries and people around the world. Peace in the Middle East is closely related to the People's Republic of Bulgaria, which is located in the Balkan Peninsula. The Chinese people, like the Bulgarian people, fully support the just struggle of the Syrian people to safeguard national independence and peace in the Middle East. The perverse acts of the US aggressive bloc, attempting to ignite a major war in the Middle East, will only isolate them more and more in the world, while more and more peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world will stand with the Syrian people.

　　The people of China and Bulgaria have long established a deep friendship. The Chinese people are very familiar with and respect Comrade Dimitrov, an outstanding activist of the international workers' movement and a great son of the Bulgarian people. His heroic revolutionary deeds and his great concern for the Chinese people once powerfully inspired the Chinese people who were engaged in a difficult struggle for the liberation of their motherland. The Chinese people will always remember Comrade Dimitrov with infinite respect.

　　In recent years, the cooperative relations between our two countries in political, economic, and cultural fields have developed rapidly. Exchanges between the people of the two countries have become increasingly close. Last September, Comrade Yugov led the Bulgarian Communist Party delegation to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. At the beginning of this year, the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country, headed by Comrade Peng Zhen, paid a friendly visit to Bulgaria and was received with fraternal warmth by the Bulgarian people and government. This time, Comrade Yugov is leading the Bulgarian Government Delegation to visit our country at the invitation of our government. We are deeply convinced that this visit will be an important symbol of the growing friendly relations between our two peoples. This visit will surely make a good contribution to further enhancing the friendship between our two peoples and will further strengthen the unity of socialist countries.

　　Comrades and friends, I propose a toast:

　　To the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria,

　　To the unity of socialist countries,

　　To world peace,

　　To the health of Comrade Yugov and all the comrades of the Bulgarian Government Delegation,

　　To the health of Comrade Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria!

　　在欢迎保加利亚政府代表团宴会上
　　周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社15日讯  周恩来总理在欢迎保加利亚政府代表团宴会上的讲话，全文如下：
　　敬爱的于哥夫主席同志，
　　敬爱的保加利亚政府代表团全体同志们，
　　同志们，朋友们：
    今天我们怀着十分亲切和愉快的心情，在这里和我们的贵宾、中国人民的好朋友——保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席于哥夫同志和保加利亚政府代表团全体同志欢聚一堂。请允许我代表中国政府和中国人民向以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚政府代表团全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    保加利亚人民是英勇、勤劳、并且富有革命传统的人民。保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党和政府的领导下，为自己国家的社会主义建设事业进行了不懈的努力，并且获得了巨大的成就。在短短的十三年时间里，保加利亚已经从一个农业国变成为一个拥有现代化工业和合作化农业的国家。保加利亚人民的物质和文化生活水平正随着国民经济的发展而逐步提高。现在，他们正在以忘我的劳动为在今年提前和超额完成保加利亚第二个五年计划而努力。我们衷心地祝贺兄弟的保加利亚人民在社会主义建设事业中获得新的更大的成就。
    保加利亚人民一贯忠实于无产阶级国际主义的原则，在加强社会主义各国间的友好合作和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结方面，他们作出了重要的贡献。在国际事务中，保加利亚人民共和国一贯奉行和平的对外政策，并且为和缓国际紧张局势，维护欧洲和世界和平的事业进行了巨大的努力。中国人民完全支持保加利亚人民的这种努力，并且将继续和保加利亚人民一起为进一步加强社会主义各国的团结和捍卫世界和平的伟大事业共同奋斗。
    但是，正当全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民为进一步和缓国际紧张局势而努力的时候，美国统治集团却在中近东地区进行公开的军事威胁，粗暴地干涉叙利亚的内政。美国这种挑衅行动不仅严重地破坏了联合国宪章的原则，而且也严重地威胁着中近东地区和全世界的和平。这种不安的局势已经引起了叙利亚等阿拉伯国家和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的最大愤慨和严厉谴责。中近东地区的和平对于处在巴尔干半岛的保加利亚人民共和国来说是息息相关的。中国人民如同保加利亚人民一样，完全支持叙利亚人民为维护民族独立和中近东和平而进行的正义斗争。美国侵略集团企图在中近东引起巨大战火的倒行逆施，只有使他们在世界上越来越孤立，而世界上爱好和平和维护正义的人民会越来越多地同叙利亚人民站在一起。
    中保两国人民早已建立了深厚的友谊。中国人民十分熟悉和尊敬国际工人运动的杰出活动家、保加利亚人民的伟大儿子——季米特洛夫同志。他的英雄的革命事迹和他对中国人民的巨大关怀，曾经有力地鼓舞了为争取祖国的解放而进行艰苦斗争的中国人民。中国人民将永远以无限尊敬的心情怀念季米特洛夫同志。
    近年来，我们两国之间的政治、经济和文化各方面的合作关系获得了迅速的发展。两国人民之间的往来日益密切。去年9月，于哥夫同志曾经率领保加利亚共产党代表团参加了中国共产党的第八次代表大会，受到了中国人民的热烈欢迎。今年年初，以彭真同志为首的我国全国人民代表大会代表团在保加利亚进行了友好访问，受到了保加利亚人民和政府兄弟般的热情接待。这次，于哥夫同志又率领保加利亚政府代表团，应我国政府的邀请前来我国访问。我们深信，这次访问将是我们两国人民友好关系日益发展的一个重要标志。这次访问对于进一步增进我们两国人民的友谊一定会作出良好的贡献，同时也将进一步加强社会主义各国的团结。
    同志们和朋友们，我提议大家举杯，
    为中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为社会主义各国的团结，
    为世界和平，
    为于哥夫同志和保加利亚政府代表团全体同志的健康，
    为保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团主席达米扬诺夫同志的健康干杯！
