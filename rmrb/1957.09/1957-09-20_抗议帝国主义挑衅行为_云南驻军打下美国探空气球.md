　　Protest Imperialist Provocative Actions
　　Yunnan Garrison Shoots Down American Reconnaissance Balloon
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 17th -- A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on the Yunnan border shot down an American Navy reconnaissance balloon sent towards our country on September 2nd. This balloon floated into Yunnan Province from Guangxi and moved in a southwest direction. At 19:15 on September 2nd, over Linxiang County, after being detected and identified by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's anti-aircraft artillery, it was hit accurately, and the balloon landed in Linxiang County. It was found that in a box under the balloon, there was a radio transmitter, as well as dry batteries and storage batteries needed for these transmitters. On the box and transmitter were the words "U.S. NAVY" and "U.S. NAVY AIRBORNE TRANSMITTER"; and in several languages ​​it stated that whoever found it should hand it over to the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Navy Department in Washington.
　　As early as January and February 1956, the American military authorities openly sent a large number of military reconnaissance balloons into our country's airspace with the aim of photographing our country's terrain. On February 7, 1956, the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement expressing a serious protest to the US authorities regarding this matter, and demanding that the US government immediately stop this provocative act. This time, the US Navy openly sent military reconnaissance balloons into our country's airspace, once again proving that this is a clear hostile activity by the US authorities against our country.

　　抗议帝国主义挑衅行为
　　云南驻军打下美国探空气球
    新华社昆明17日电　驻守在云南边疆的中国人民解放军某高射炮部队，在9月2日打下了美国海军向我国放送的一个探空气球。这个气球由广西方面飘入云南境内，向西南方向移动。9月2日十九时十五分，在临沧县上空，被中国人民解放军某部高射炮兵侦察识别之后，以准确的火力击中了球体，气球降落在临沧县境内。经查明，在气球下面的一个箱子里，装置着无线电发射机，以及供这些发射机需要的干电池和蓄电瓶等。在箱子和发射机上，有“美国海军”（U·S·NAVY）和“美国海军空中发射机”等字样；并以数国文字声明，要求发现它的人把它交给华盛顿美国海军部气象局。
    远在1956年1、2月间，美国军事当局就公然向我国领土上空放送了大量的军事侦察气球，目的在摄取我国地形。1956年2月7日，中华人民共和国外交部发言人曾就此事发表声明，向美国当局表示严重抗议，并且要求美国政府立即制止这种挑衅行为。此次，美国海军又公然向我国领土上空放送军事侦察气球，再一次证明了这是美国当局对我国的明显的敌性活动。
