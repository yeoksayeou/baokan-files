Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 22nd: The Saudi Arabian Minister of Transport, Aziz, who is currently visiting Cairo, told a "Al-Ahram" reporter on the 20th that "The mutual trust between Saudi Arabia and Egypt is very strong, and no conspiracy can shake it."

Saudi King's brother, Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, said, "Saudi Arabia is willing to hand over its best and most precious asset—its army—to Egypt. There is no fact more illustrative of Saudi Arabia's trust in Egypt than this. The Commander-in-Chief of the Saudi Arabian army is the Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian army, Major General Amer."

Aziz said, "The purpose of imperialism's activities today is to divert our attention from our real enemy, Israel."

He expressed his respect for Nasser's leadership, saying that his leadership "symbolizes the hopes of all Arabs."

The Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Egypt said here on the evening of the 20th that the Saudi King informed him that the Saudi visit to Syria was to express that the Saudi Arabian government and military and civilians support Syria in any situation.
