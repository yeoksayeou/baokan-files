Fantasizing About Letting Reactionary Rulers Stage a Comeback
Zhang Yingnan Was a Bodyguard of the Pseudo-Legal System

　　This newspaper reports that the Legislative Affairs Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has held meetings for several days to expose and refute the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks made by Zhang Yingnan, a staff member of the office, a director of the Political Science and Law Association, and a member of the Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, under the guise of helping the Party with rectification.

　　Zhang Yingnan's attack on the Party started with judicial reform. He described the judicial reform as terrible, believing that the judicial reform "hit some academic authorities in the legal field too hard, and their spirits have not recovered until now, and their enthusiasm cannot be raised." He believes that "now new people are unwilling to study law, old people want to change careers, and only people who are not qualified study law, so it can be said to be a destructive act for law." Zhang Yingnan here not only negates the necessity of criticizing the old legal viewpoints and rectifying the judicial organs in the judicial reform, but also attempts to provoke the dissatisfaction of the old legal circles and the old judicial personnel against the Party and the government. What is even more infuriating is that today, eight or nine years after the Kuomintang's Six Codes were abolished, Zhang Yingnan still openly clamors: "New and old laws should be given equal importance, and we cannot simply welcome the new and abandon the old." He believes that the legal circles "are not enough to rely solely on Marxism-Leninism." He believes that "there is a side of truth in the old law, and the old law cannot be completely denied," but should be "discarding the false and retaining the true." He even believes that only "learning and transforming on the old basis can meet the needs." This is a fundamental negation of the Party and the government's policy of abolishing the pseudo-legal system and the pseudo-Six Codes, and an attempt to restore the old law and the old jurisprudence to confront the people's new law and the Marxist-Leninist new jurisprudence, and to open up a way for the old legal personnel who have been purged to return to power.

　　It is precisely because Zhang Yingnan stands on such a reactionary position that, in his view, the political and legal work after liberation has almost no achievements, and the entire legal world after liberation is in darkness. He said: "In recent years, due to the government's lack of attention, law has become a weak link." He said: "Now there are few legal experts and their quality is weak. There are very few people in the legislative and judicial organs who understand the law." He said: "Because the government does not recognize or attach importance to administrative law, many problems have occurred in administrative management." Why does this "depression" phenomenon occur? He believes that it is because the Party's leadership in political and legal work is very bad, and that the Party's leading cadres in political and legal departments are all "laymen" who "do not understand the business," and do not respect the old jurists, and have a "commandism that can be summoned and waved away."

　　Zhang Yingnan not only obliterated the achievements of judicial reform and political and legal work, but also launched a vicious attack on our country's political system. He said: "The occurrence of many problems now is centered on the issue of the system," and also said: "The separation of party and government, the substitution of the party for the government, having power without official position, having official position without power, and the occurrence of the three evils are all due to the failure to establish a good system." Then, what kind of system can be regarded as "good"? In Zhang Yingnan's view, it is not our people's congress system, but the "separation of powers" system flaunted by capitalist countries, or the "ruling the country by the party" system of the Kuomintang reactionaries. He despises the system stipulated in our constitution that "the National People's Congress is the only organ exercising state legislative power," and he insists that we use the method of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and that the "Central Political Conference" should exercise the highest legislative power of the state.

　　Zhang Yingnan's reactionary words and deeds have their profound class roots and ideological roots. This rightist not only served as a military judge for Hu Zongduo, the anti-communist suppression officer of Hubei, during the Kuomintang rule, and served as an old lawyer and old law professor for a long time, but as early as 1930, he became a party member of Zhang Junmai, a notorious war criminal, and became "one of the veterans of the Democratic Socialist Party." From that time on, he and Zhang Junmai relied on each other and used each other, forming an indissoluble bond. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, although he joined the China Democratic League, he still firmly attached himself to the Democratic Socialist Party. That is why, between 1946 and 1948, when countless patriotic democrats were persecuted, he was able to make rapid progress and be promoted step by step. He was nominated as a pseudo-National Congress representative and also served as a legislator of the Kuomintang reactionary government and a member of the Central Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party. As he himself said, he has always been a "politician scholar."

　　After liberation, the Party and the government did not bear grudges, but still let him hold important positions, and provided him with learning opportunities according to his requirements. However, this rightist not only did not work hard to transform himself, nor did he thank the Party and the government for their trust and care for him, but instead harbored great hatred for the Party and the government.

　　From the beginning of August to the present, the cadres of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress have held continuous meetings on this rightist Zhang Yingnan, who claims to be a "legal expert" and "authority on administrative law," and have relentlessly exposed and sternly refuted his anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, making this rightist speechless and having to begin to admit his crimes.

### 妄想让反动统治者卷土重来  张映南是伪法统的保镖

　　妄想让反动统治者卷土重来
　　张映南是伪法统的保镖
    本报讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会法律室连日举行会议，揭露和驳斥了该室工作人员、政法学会理事、民盟中央联络委员会委员张映南借帮助党整风之名发表的反党、反社会主义的言论。
    张映南的向党进攻首先从司法改革开刀。他把司法改革说得很糟糕，认为司法改革“对法律界一些学术权威打击太重，直到现在精神还没有恢复过来，积极性还提不起来”。认为“现在弄得新人不愿学法，旧人要改行，只有不够材料的人才学法，因此对法学可说是一种摧残行为”。张映南在这里不仅否定了司法改革中批判旧法观点和整顿司法机关的必要性，而且企图挑起旧法学界人士和旧司法人员对党和政府的不满情绪。更加令人愤慨的是，在国民党的六法全书被废除后已八、九年的今天，张映南竟还公开叫嚷：“新旧法应该并重，不能单纯迎接新的，抛弃旧的”。认为法学界“单靠马列主义是不够的”。认为“在旧法里有真理的一面，对旧法不能一棍子打死”，而要“去伪存真”。甚至认为只有“在旧的基础上学习改造才能适应需要”。这是从根本上否定党和政府废除伪法统、废除伪六法全书的方针，妄图恢复旧法和旧法学，以与人民的新法和马列主义的新法学相对抗，并为被清洗出去的旧法人员开辟重新上台的道路。
    正因为张映南站在这样反动的立场上，所以在他看来，解放后的政法工作简直毫无成绩，解放后的整个法律界都是漆黑一团。他说：“几年来由于政府不重视，法学已经成为薄弱的一环。”他说：“现在法学界量少质弱，立法机关、司法机关懂得法的人很少。”他说：“由于政府不认识、不重视行政法，因而行政管理上出了许多毛病。”为什么会出现这种“不景气”的现象呢？他认为是由于党对政法工作领导得很不好，是由于政法部门的党员领导干部都是“外行”，“不懂业务”，而对老法学家又不尊重，有“召之即来，挥之即去的命令主义”。
    张映南不仅抹煞了司法改革和政法工作的成绩，而且对我们国家的政治制度也进行了恶毒的攻击。他说：“现在很多问题的发生，中心是个制度问题”，又说：“党政不分，以党代政，有职无权，无职有权，以及三害等的发生，都是没有建立良好制度的缘故”。那末，什么样的制度才算是“良好”呢？在张映南看来，并不是我们的人民代表大会制度，而是资本主义国家所标榜的“三权分立”制度，或者是国民党反动派的“以党治国”制度。他藐视我国宪法上规定的“全国人民代表大会是行使国家立法权的唯一机关”的制度，他硬要我们搬用国民党反动派的办法，由什么“中央政治会议”来行使国家的最高立法权。
    张映南的这些反动言行，是有它深刻的阶级根源和思想根源的。这个右派分子在国民党统治时期，不仅当过湖北反共清乡督办胡宗铎的军法官，长期担任过旧律师和旧法教授，而且远在1930年，他就成为臭名远扬的战争罪犯张君劢的党徒，成为“民社党的元老之一”。从那时起，他就和张君劢互相依靠，互相利用，结下了不解之缘。抗日战争胜利以后，他虽然加入了民盟，但他仍然牢牢地依附着民社党。惟其如此，所以在1946年到1948年之间当无数的爱国民主人士备遭迫害的时候，他却能够飞黄腾达，步步高升，先后被提名为伪国大代表，还当上了国民党反动政府的立法委员和民社党的中央委员。诚如他自己所说的，他从来就是个“政客学者”。
    解放以后，党和政府不念旧恶，仍然让他担任重要职务，并且根据他的要求，给以学习机会。可是这个右派分子不但不努力改造自己，不但不感激党和政府对他的信任和照顾，反而对党和政府怀着极大的仇恨。
    人大常委会机关干部对这个自命为“法律专家”和“行政法权威”的右派分子张映南，从8月初到现在，连续举行会议，无情地揭露了和严正地驳斥了他的反党、反社会主义言行，使得这个右派分子理屈词穷，不得不开始承认自己的罪行。
