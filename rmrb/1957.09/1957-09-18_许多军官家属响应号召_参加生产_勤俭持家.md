Xinhua News Agency report:

Many officers' families stationed in various parts of the People's Liberation Army are actively participating in various forms of productive labor and paying attention to diligence and frugality in managing their households.

Many officers' families have joined agricultural production cooperatives near their garrisons and are engaged in agricultural labor alongside the farmers. Some officers' families stationed in cities have organized laundry groups and sewing groups to wash bedding, scrub cotton clothes, and mend work clothes for the logistics and medical departments of the troops. When the troops' work is intense, some officers' families go into the kitchens to help cooks with cooking and making tofu.

Among the officers' families, many are female soldiers from the war years, who have now become diligent and frugal housewives. Peng Zhen, who joined the Red Army in 1932 and served as the captain of the Red Jiang County Guerrilla Detachment and the chief of staff of the Fourth Red Army Women's Regiment, suffered six serious injuries and became a first-class disabled person. Now, in addition to cooking for her husband and children, she personally makes clothes for her children and reclaims a large area of wasteland to grow vegetables and raise chickens. Gao Feng, the wife of a demobilized soldier and lieutenant military doctor in a certain unit, often takes her children to the mountains to cut firewood and did not buy a single piece of firewood last year. Zhai Ping, the mother of seven children, is the wife of a general. She joined the revolution in 1938 and is now a housewife with a family of more than a dozen people. She does not hire a nanny and does all the housework herself. Yang Ziying, the wife of a political instructor in a certain unit, was awarded a "Diligence and Frugality in Managing the Household" certificate by the unit for her good "Diligence and Frugality in Managing the Household."

　　许多军官家属响应号召
　　参加生产　勤俭持家
    据新华社讯　驻全国各地人民解放军许多部队的军官家属们，积极参加各种生产劳动，并且注意勤俭持家。
    许多军官家属参加了驻地附近的农业生产合作社，和农民一道从事农业劳动。有些驻在城市的部队的军官家属组织了洗衣组、缝纫组，为部队后勤和医疗部门拆洗被褥、刷洗棉衣、缝补工作服。在部队工作任务紧张的时候，有些军官家属深入伙房，帮助炊事员做饭烧菜、磨豆腐。
    在军官家属中，有不少是战争时期的女战士，现在都成了勤俭持家的家庭主妇。1932年参加红军、当过红江县游击大队长和红四军妇女团参谋长的彭珍，负过六次重伤，成了一等残废，现在她除了给丈夫和孩子们做饭做菜以外，还亲自给孩子们做衣裳，开出一大片荒地种菜、养鸡。复员军人、某部中尉军医的爱人高峰，常带着孩子上山割柴，去年一年没有买过一根木柴。七个孩子的母亲翟平是一位将军的妻子，她1938年参加革命，现在是一个十几口人的家庭主妇。她没有请保姆，一切家务劳动都亲自动手。某部政治指导员的爱人杨子英，因为“勤俭持家”好，而获得部队授予的“勤俭持家”的奖状。
