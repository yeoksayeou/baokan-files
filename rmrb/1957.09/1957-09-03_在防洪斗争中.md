    In the Flood Prevention Struggle
    By Our Correspondent Miao Feng
    Just as the people of Heilongjiang Province were victoriously pursuing the right-wingers who were anti-Party and anti-socialist, another enemy—the flood—rushed in from the Songhua River, the Lalin River, the Mudan River, and the Muling River, surging towards the cities and villages from the large and small mother rivers. The flood, like the right-wingers, underestimated the power of the peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    These days and nights here are so extraordinary! The river level rises every minute, but the thousands of miles of dikes are raised and thickened every second. This is a real race against time, a race against the flood.
    Over 400,000 flood prevention soldiers—officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, peasants, cadres, citizens, teachers, students...they are all heroes fighting the flood. The Guxiangtun Dam in Harbin was breached and riddled with holes more than once by the wind and waves. Although the wind was strong, the waves were high, and the autumn water was cold, thousands of people often jumped into the water together, shoulder to shoulder, chest to chest. The huge waves crashed down, and a wave-breaking embankment built by a dozen layers of people blocked the giant waves. Their bodies were numb, their faces turned purple, they clenched their teeth, persevered, persevered, one hour, two hours... and kept on until the dangerous breach was blocked. These included officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, employees of the Zhengyanghe Lumber Factory in Harbin, employees of the Local State-Owned Pickles Factory, teachers and students of the Fourteenth Middle School, cadres of the Handicraft Administration, and female comrades such as Zhang Shuzhen and Li Ya.
    During the days and nights of the battle, how many heroes and models emerged from the transportation front, the food supply front, medical care, public security...
    During the days and nights of the battle, the streets of Harbin were still so clean, the lights were still so bright, the factory chimneys were smoking as usual, and the trains were running normally... However, the pedestrians on the road were obviously reduced, and the customers in the shops were not as crowded as in the past. Many people automatically joined the flood control battle.
    The flood continues to rise, and people are meeting it with even more arduous struggle!

    在防洪斗争中
    本报记者  苗风
    当黑龙江省人民胜利地追击着反党反社会主义的右派分子的时候，又一个敌人——洪水，从松花江，从拉林河，从牡丹江，从穆棱河，从大大小小的母河扑天盖地地向城市和乡村奔腾而来。洪水像右派分子一样，低估了在共产党领导下的农民的力量。
    这里的日日夜夜是多么不平常啊！江河水位每分钟都在上涨，可是千里堤防却在每秒钟里升高和加厚。这是一场真正和时间赛跑，和洪水赛跑的斗争。
    四十多万防洪大军——解放军官兵、工人、农民、干部、市民、教师、学生………他们都是和洪水搏斗的英雄。哈尔滨顾乡屯大坝，曾不止一次被风浪吹击得脱坡和钻出洞穴，虽然风大浪高秋水凉，千百人常常一起跳下水去，肩膀扣着肩膀，胸膛贴着胸膛，大浪劈头盖脑地压下来，十几层人筑成的防浪堤，挡住了巨浪。身体麻木了，脸皮发紫了，咬紧牙关，坚持，坚持，一小时，两小时……一直坚持到险口堵住为止。这就是解放军的官兵、哈尔滨正阳河制材厂的职工、地方国营酱菜厂的职工、十四中学的教员和学生、手工业管理局的干部、张淑珍、李雅等女同志也在里面。
    在战斗的日日夜夜里，运输战线、食品供应战线、医疗、治安……涌现了多少英雄模范啊！
    在战斗的日日夜夜里，哈尔滨市区街道上还是那么干净，灯火还是那么辉煌，工厂的烟囱像平常一样冒着烟，火车还是正常地运行着……然而，马路上的行人显然减少了，商店的顾客不像往日拥挤了，许多人都自动地投入了防汛战斗。
    洪水继续上涨着，人们正以更艰苦的斗争迎接着它！
