Nai Pi Zi, or milk skin, is a famous product of the pastoral areas of Hulunbuir League or Xilingol League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and a traditional dairy product favored by the Mongolian people. It is pure white in color and has a fragrant and palatable taste. Every winter, when silvery snowflakes flutter across the grasslands and the surroundings are quiet, people gather around the stove in yurts to keep warm, drinking milk tea, and the aroma of children toasting nai pi zi fills the entire yurt, which is truly a unique flavor.

The nutritional value of nai pi zi is very high, with protein, fat, lactose, and moisture content not inferior to butter. While butter only has about 5% protein, nai pi zi has 9.29% protein.

    奶皮子
    奶皮子是内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟或锡林郭勒盟牧区的名产，是蒙古族人民所喜爱的传统的乳制品。色洁白，味香适口。每年冬天，当草原上飘着银白色的雪花，四周寂静无声，人们在蒙古包里围炉取暖，喝着奶茶，小孩子烤奶皮子的香气弥漫在整个包里，真是别有风味。
    奶皮子的营养价值很高，蛋白质、脂肪、乳糖、水份等都不次于黄油。黄油的蛋白质仅有5％左右，奶皮子的蛋白质有9.29％。
