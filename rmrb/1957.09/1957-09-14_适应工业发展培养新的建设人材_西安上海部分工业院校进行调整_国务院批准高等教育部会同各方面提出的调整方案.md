Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Following the decision to establish separate campuses of Jiaotong University in Xi'an and Shanghai, the Ministry of Higher Education, in conjunction with relevant central departments and the party and government leading organs of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an City, and Shanghai City, repeatedly and carefully studied the deployment of some industrial colleges in Xi'an and Shanghai and proposed an adjustment plan. The State Council approved this adjustment plan on September 12th.

Prior to this adjustment, Xi'an had four higher industrial schools: Jiaotong University, Xi'an Power College, Xi'an Aviation College, and Xi'an Architectural Engineering College. Xianyang had one Northwest Institute of Technology. Due to adjustments in the national industrial deployment and changes in the task of training cadres in the Second Five-Year Plan, the setup and tasks of each school needed to be rearranged. This adjustment merged the above five schools into three. The Northwest Institute of Technology, except for the textile, mining, and newly established geology departments, which were transferred to Jiaotong University, was entirely merged with Xi'an Aviation College to form a multi-disciplinary higher industrial school serving the defense industry, named Northwestern Polytechnical University, with its campus located in Xi'an. The faculty, staff, and students of the original Northwest Institute of Technology in Xianyang will be relocated to Xi'an in stages. Xi'an Power College was abolished and merged into Jiaotong University. The water conservancy and soil improvement specialty department of Northwest Agricultural College, which is an engineering specialty, was also merged into Jiaotong University. In this way, the Xi'an campus of Jiaotong University will gradually develop into an engineering university closely integrated with Northwest industrial construction. In the next semester of this year, it will offer twenty-three majors, including machinery, electrical engineering, water conservancy, geology, mining, textiles, and science, of which applied mathematics, engineering mechanics, and mineral geological exploration are newly established. Xi'an Architectural Engineering College remains an engineering college serving industrial and civil construction, and the major settings will not be changed.

In Shanghai, higher industrial schools of mechanical and electrical engineering have also been adjusted to avoid duplication and waste of resources, as well as dispersal of strength. It was decided that Nanyang Institute of Technology would be merged into Jiaotong University. The Shipbuilding College is under the unified leadership of Jiaotong University, with unified administrative work, and the same majors are merged. After this adjustment, the Shanghai campus of Jiaotong University, together with the shipbuilding majors under its leadership, will offer nineteen majors in mechanics, electrical engineering, shipbuilding, etc., of which thermal machinery manufacturing is a new major that has just begun to be set up this new academic year.

The above adjustment plans have been widely discussed by the faculty and staff of the relevant schools, who expressed their agreement. The relevant adjustment and merger work is being actively carried out and is expected to be completed soon.

　　适应工业发展培养新的建设人材
　　西安上海部分工业院校进行调整
　　国务院批准高等教育部会同各方面提出的调整方案
    据新华社13日讯  交通大学决定分设在西安、上海两地以后，高等教育部紧接着会同中央各有关的业务部门及陕西省、西安市、上海市等地党政领导机关反复慎重地研究了西安、上海两地部分工业院校的部署，并且提出了调整的方案。国务院已于9月12日批准了这个调整方案。
    在这次调整以前，西安原有交通大学、西安动力学院、西安航空学院、西安建筑工程学院四所高等工业学校，咸阳有一所西北工学院。由于国家工业部署有所调整，第二个五年计划中培养干部的任务有些变动，因此，各校的设置和任务需要重新安排。这次调整，是将上述五所学校合并为三所。原西北工学院除纺织、采矿和新设的地质专业调入交通大学外，其余全部和西安航空学院合并，组成一所为国防工业服务的多科性的高等工业学校，定名为西北工业大学，校址设在西安。在咸阳的原西北工学院教职员工学生将分年迁往西安。西安动力学院撤销，并入交通大学。西北农学院的水利土壤改良专业系工科性质的专业，也并入交通大学。这样，交通大学西安部分将逐步发展成为和西北工业建设紧密结合的工科大学，今年下学期将设置包括机、电、水利、地质、采矿、纺织、理科等类的二十三个专业，其中应用数学、工程力学、矿产地质勘探三个专业是新设的。西安建筑工程学院仍然是为工业和民用基本建设服务的工学院，专业设置不作变动。
    上海方面机电类的高等工业学校，为了避免专业设置上的重复浪费和分散力量，这次也作了调整。决定南洋工学院并入交通大学。造船学院由交通大学统一领导，行政工作统一，相同的各专业合并。经过这样调整后，交通大学上海部分连同划归领导的造船各专业，将共设置机械、电机、造船等类十九个专业，其中热力机械制造专业是在这个新学年才开始设置的。
    以上调整方案都曾经过有关各校的教职员工进行了广泛的讨论，表示同意。目前有关调整合并工作正在积极进行中，预计不久都可就绪。
