Shanxi Province Establishes Farmers' Spare-Time Middle Schools

　　This reporter Shang Kai reports: Shanxi is actively preparing to establish farmers' spare-time middle schools to meet the cultural learning needs of educated youth in rural areas.

　　In order to solve this problem, many townships and agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province have successfully piloted farmers' spare-time middle schools. The Daqu Township Farmers' Spare-Time Middle School in Anyi County is a good example. The Daqu Township Farmers' Spare-Time Middle School was established in October 1956, with a total of three teachers and eighty-four students, divided into two classes, each with study groups. The courses include: literature, arithmetic, history, geography, biology, agricultural technology, and politics.

　　Farmers' spare-time middle schools have the following three characteristics: First, spare-time middle schools are run by the people, and the expenses are not borne by the state. Teachers' teaching remuneration is shared by the students (generally, each student only needs to contribute five to ten labor days per year), and the school's operating expenses, in addition to a portion subsidized by local and agricultural cooperative public welfare funds, are covered by students' voluntary labor. Second, teachers and students do not leave production. They follow the principle of "study more when not busy, study less when slightly busy, and take a break when very busy" to coordinate the time for production and learning, so that learning and production are not delayed. Third, the content of learning is closely integrated with agricultural production. It is completely different from general supplementary schools. The purpose of students learning culture and technology is to better serve agricultural production. The experience of pilot spare-time middle schools in various places has proven that farmers' spare-time middle schools not only meet the learning needs of the vast number of rural youths, enabling their cultural level to continue to improve, but more importantly, they closely integrate their cultural learning with agricultural production, playing an active role in promoting science and technology and enlivening rural cultural life.

　　A responsible comrade from the Cultural and Educational Department of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee told reporters: Farmers' spare-time middle schools are very suitable for the needs of today's rural situation. Any place that can solve the problems of teachers, teaching materials, school buildings, and funding can hold them. Judging from the situation in most areas of Shanxi Province, it is not very difficult to solve these three problems. Regarding the teacher issue, intellectuals in the countryside can be hired. Agricultural technology courses can be taught by technicians from the local agricultural technology promotion station; political courses can be taught by local party and government leading cadres. Regarding teaching materials, the Provincial Department of Education plans to compile them uniformly. Before the new teaching materials are compiled, current textbooks used in regular middle schools can be borrowed or purchased as teaching materials; agricultural technology courses can use the currently published booklets on agricultural science and technology. Regarding teaching locations, in addition to a few townships or agricultural cooperatives that have more vacant houses that can be used exclusively, classrooms in private schools can generally be borrowed.

　　According to statistics from five counties, Xinxian, Daixian, Guoxian, Xingxian, and Yangqu, there are already forty-one classes being prepared for establishment and already established; Jinnan area is developing faster, and Anyi County alone plans to add eighteen classes.

### 山西兴办农民业余中学

　　山西兴办农民业余中学
    本报记者商恺报道  山西各地正积极筹办农民业余中学，以满足在乡知识青年学习文化的要求。
    山西省为了解决这个问题，许多乡和农业社试办农民业余中学已经成功。安邑县大渠乡农民业余中学是办得较好的一个。大渠乡农民业余中学于1956年10月建立，共有教师三人，学员八十四人，分编两个班，班下有自习小组。课程有：文学、算术、史地、生物、农业技术、政治等。
    农民业余中学有以下三个特点：第一、业余中学是民办的，经费不由国家负担。教师的教学报酬，由学员分摊（一般情况，每个学员每年出五个至十个劳动日就够了），学校办公经费除由地方上和农业社的公益金中补助一部分外，其余的由学生义务劳动来解决。第二、教师和学员均不脱离生产，他们根据“不忙多学、小忙少学、大忙放学”的原则，统筹安排生产和学习的时间，可以作到学习生产两不误。第三、学习内容和农业生产紧密结合，它和一般的补习学校完全不同，学员学习文化和技术的目的，是为了更好地为农业生产服务。各地试办业余中学的经验证明：农民业余中学不但满足了广大农村青年的学习要求，使他们的文化水平得以继续提高；更重要的是，使他们的文化学习和农业生产紧密结合起来，对推广科学技术，活跃农村文化生活，都起了积极的推动作用。
    中共山西省委文教部负责同志对记者谈：农民业余中学非常适合今天农村情况的需要，凡是能自行解决教师、教材、校址和经费的地方，都可以举办。从山西省大部分地区的情况看，要解决这三个问题，并不十分困难。关于教师问题，可以聘请在乡知识分子来担任。农业技术课可以聘请当地农业技术推广站的技术人员讲授；政治课聘请当地党政领导干部讲授。关于教材问题，省教育厅计划统一编写，在新的教材没有编写出来以前，可以借用或购买正规中学的现用课本作教材；农业技术课，可以采用现在出版的有关农业科学技术的小册子。关于教学地址，除个别的乡或农业社有较多的空闲房屋可以专用外，一般可以借用民校的教室。
    据忻县、代县、崞县、兴县、阳曲等五个县的统计，筹备建立和已经建立的已经有四十一个班；晋南地区发展较快，仅安邑一个县即计划增设十八个班。
