    "Eating won't make you poor, dressing won't make you poor, but lack of planning will make you poor forever." Hu Wenxiu, the mother of revolutionary martyr Liu Hulan of Shanxi Province, began telling me how she manages her household frugally in this way. She said that her family has seven people, and besides the two adults, there are three children between the ages of eleven and eighteen. As the saying goes, "Half-grown children can eat their parents to death." However, last year the whole family received a total of 2,800 catties of grain, and they still had more than 100 catties left over until this year's autumn harvest.

    What is the reason for this? She said that farmers must have a plan in their hearts when they live their lives, and make plans according to the size of their family property. Then she explained in detail her experience of managing a household with careful calculations: When milling rice, people generally mill it three times, but she only mills it twice. When grinding flour, she always grinds it two or three more times than others. In this way, milling rice and grinding flour can yield five more catties of rice from 100 catties of grain, and five or six more catties of flour from 100 catties of sorghum or wheat. These coarse flours can be mixed with some fine flour to make steamed buns or pancakes. She said: "For farming families, coarse tea and simple meals are enough, as long as we are full. This is much better than eating chaff before liberation."

    Hu Wenxiu said that life should also be divided into slack and busy seasons. During the busy farming season, there are three meals a day. In the morning and at noon, some dry food or fried noodles (corn and soybeans are fried and ground into flour, then eaten in porridge) should be prepared, and in the evening, some thin porridge should be eaten. During the slack farming season, it should be changed to two meals a day. From October of the previous year to March of the following year, more soup-based meals should be eaten, with more vegetables added. This can save half a catty of grain a day, and seven or eighty catties can be saved in five months.

    In life, whether eating thick or drinking thin, there must be a plan in mind. When cooking, estimate how much to eat and make that much. If you make too much, it will be wasted. Last autumn, Hu Wenxiu went to Beijing to participate in the National People's Congress. Before leaving, based on her usual experience, she prepared enough rice and flour for her family to eat for a whole month. But when she returned, her family had not only finished the rice and flour that had been prepared, but also had only half of the additional 100 catties left. When her family saw that she was unhappy, they said: "We didn't eat into two stomachs." She explained: It's not that you ate into two stomachs, it's just that there was no plan for eating grain, and the cooking was not even, so everyone ate more when more was made.

    "In life, the difference between being rough and being meticulous can be huge!" She said that she has a neighbor whose family also has seven people, and the strength of their labor force and the size and number of their children are similar to hers. Last year, they received only twenty catties less grain than her family in total, but they just didn't have a plan in their hearts when they lived their lives. As soon as the wheat came down, they ate pulled noodles, shaved noodles, ti jian (a type of noodle), and noodle soup every day. As soon as the rice came down, they ate rice for one meal and rice for the next meal. As a result, by February of this year, they had eaten all their rice and flour and had to ask the agricultural cooperative for supplies and buy grain from others. Hu Wenxiu said that her family sold thirty catties of grain to this neighbor.

    刘胡兰的妈妈谈勤俭持家
    黄德淑
    “吃不穷，穿不穷，打算不到一世穷。”山西省革命烈士刘胡兰的母亲——胡文秀，这样开始向我讲述她是如何勤俭过日子的。她说，她家有七口人，除了两个大人，就有三个十一岁到十八岁的孩子。俗语说，“半大小子，吃死老子。”可是，去年全家总共分了二千八百斤粮食，吃到今年收秋，还能剩一百多斤。
    这是什么原因呢？她说，庄稼人过日子心里要有个底才行，有多大个家当，作多大个计划。接着她详细地介绍了精打细算过日子的经验：碾米的时候，人家一般要碾三次，她只碾二次。磨面的时候她总要比别人多磨两三次。这样碾米磨面，一百斤谷子能多出五斤米，一百斤高粱或小麦能多出五、六斤面粉。这些粗面，掺上一些细面，可以蒸馒头，也可以烙饼。她说：“庄户人家，粗茶淡饭，吃饱就好，这总比解放前吃糠强多了。”
    胡文秀说，过日子也要分出农闲和农忙。农忙的时候，一天三餐，早晨、中午要做点干饭，或炒面（玉米、黄豆炒熟了磨成面，然后放在稀饭里吃），晚上就吃些稀的。农闲的时候，就改成一日两餐，从头年10月到第二年3月，都多吃带汤的饭食，多加些瓜菜，这样一天能节约半斤粮食，五个月的时间，就可以节省七、八十斤。
    过日子，无论吃稠喝稀，心里得有个底，做饭的时候要估计吃多少，做多少，多了就要浪费。去年秋天，胡文秀到北京参加全国人民代表大会，临走的时候，根据平时的经验给家里预备了满够一个月吃的米面，可是等她回来，家里不仅把原来备下的米面吃完，另磨的一百斤也只剩下一半了。家里人见她不高兴，就说：“我们也没吃到两个肚子里去。”她解释道：不是说吃到两个肚子里了，只是说吃粮没计划，做饭不均匀，作多了大家就多吃。
    “过日子，粗一点，细一点，差别可大啦！”她说，她有一个邻居，一家也是七口人，并且劳动力的强弱，孩子大小多少，都和她家差不多，去年分的粮食，总共只比她家少二十来斤，可是他们过日子就是心里没底，麦子下来了，一天就是拉面、削面、剔尖、面片。米一下来，上顿米，下顿还是米。结果到今年2月就吃的米光面净了，要求农业社供应，还向别人买粮，胡文秀说她家就卖给了这个邻居粮食三十斤。
