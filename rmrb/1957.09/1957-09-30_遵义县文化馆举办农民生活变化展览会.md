Zunyi County Cultural Center
Holds Exhibition on Changes in Farmers' Lives

    (By our reporter) The Zunyi County Cultural Center in Guizhou Province recently held an exhibition on changes in farmers' lives. Among the exhibits were the tattered cotton clothes that Zhou Shaoqing, a poor peasant member of the Shuikuqun Agricultural Cooperative, wore for thirty-seven years in the old society, a tattered small cotton coat that had been worn for fourteen years and used to raise three children, and rice seedling quilts… On the other hand, various items reflecting the improvement of life for poor peasant member Li Shuqing since liberation were also exhibited.

    People at the exhibition clearly saw the beauty of the new society and the misery of the old society. At present, more than 200 rural clubs in the county are also actively preparing to use material exhibitions, slides, folk songs, blackboards and other forms of publicity to cooperate with the development of the rural socialist propaganda movement throughout the county.
