Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: In the past week, nearly 300,000 people in Beijing have visited the Indian Exhibition.

Those who visited the industrial products paid special attention to India's newly emerging heavy industry after independence. Xu Zhiliang, a worker from the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant who helped with the machine tool operation demonstrations at the exhibition, told reporters: Workers who have visited these past few days have looked very carefully at the machines manufactured in India. Everyone believes that there are aspects of the manufacture of some machine components that are worth learning from.

Commodities made from agricultural and native products attracted many farmers. Yang Quande, a 70-year-old farmer, praised India's rich products and the farmers' competence after his visit.

    三十多万人参观了印度展览会
    据新华社25日讯　在过去一周里，北京有近三十万人参观了印度展览会。
    参观过工业品的人都特别注意印度独立后新兴的重工业。帮助展览会作机床操作表演的北京第二机床厂工人许芝良对记者说：这几天来参观的工人对印度制造的机器都看得很仔细，大家认为，有些机器构件的制造方面有值得我们学习的地方。
    用农产品和土产品制成的商品，吸引了很多农民。七十岁的老农民杨全德参观以后，称赞印度物产很丰富，农民很能干。
