    Walking Over Two Hundred Kilometers Using Hands Instead of Feet
    An Austrian artist walked on his hands, upside down, for a total of two hundred and seventy-eight kilometers. He arrived in Vienna on the 24th, attracting much attention.
    His name is Wasserberg, and he is thirty-three years old. According to him, the purpose of his penance is to raise funds for the establishment of a sports school for crippled children.
    He started walking on his hands from Salzburg on May 15 this year, averaging three kilometers a day. He would stop and rest after walking about ninety meters, and eat something.

    以手代脚走路二百多公里
    奥地利有一个艺术家，身体倒竖，用双手走路，一共走了二百七十八公里的路程，24日到达维也纳，引起了很大的注意。
    他的名字叫瓦塞耳贝格，今年三十三岁。据他说，他的这种苦行的目的，是为创设一座跛足儿童的体育学校筹募基金。
    今年5月15日，他开始从萨尔斯堡开始用两只手走路，平均每天三公里。每走约九十多公尺的距离，就停止一下，休息休息，吃点东西。
