    We Will Always Be Together
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    Hungary is a rich and diverse country. Despite suffering four hundred years of foreign rule under Germanization policies, it has preserved its rich language and culture, excellent traditions of rural customs and folk art. After liberation, the Party made many efforts to improve the people's lives, as evidenced by the high level of cultural and recreational activities it now possesses. Hungary can be called a kingdom of sports, a scenic resort, and a land of music and dance. In addition, many beautiful and lovely children and women can be seen in parks and boulevards in various cities. I often think, what a beautiful, happy, and joyful country this would be without the interference of Western enemies! I have been to many countries in Northern and Western Europe, but none are as alluring as Hungary. This is not only because it is a member of our socialist family and its people have warm and hospitable habits, but also because it has many things that are superior to Western Europe.
    Hungary is a scientifically and technologically advanced country. I have seen the Hungarian people enthusiastically helping our country's socialist construction with their expertise in this area. We have also sent a group of students to study its various specializations. I have visited some factories in Budapest, and now at least dozens of factories have accepted orders related to our Five-Year Plan. After the October events, I saw many workers working hard to improve the quality of Chinese orders. For example, the Red Star Tractor Factory, which has decades of production experience, is supplying 80% of its output to our country this year. The factory has also specially dispatched excellent technicians to train more than 4,000 tractor drivers for our country.
    When our country launched a high tide of cooperativization, the Hungarian government also donated a tractor station to us, which will become a base for the future development of agricultural cooperation between the two countries.
    Hungary's communication equipment is world-renowned. By providing us with shortwave equipment, the communication capacity of major cities can be increased several times to more than ten times. In addition, it also provides us with microwave equipment and helps us build radio stations, etc.
    When Hungarian friends learned that our country urgently needed to develop petroleum resources and needed large-scale geological exploration in socialist construction, the Hungarian Geophysical Institute accepted our request and vigorously supported us. The institute drew its own and the best talents from various universities and research institutions to form a strong team, contributing their decades of painstaking research to our country's socialist construction.
    Hungarian experts left their comfortable homes and went deep into the remote areas of our country, working diligently and tirelessly in the wilderness, on cliffs, in the hot summers and snowy winters. It is said that due to traffic difficulties, they often did not return to their dormitories until late at night.
    The experts not only completed their own tasks, but also taught Chinese apprentices to master advanced technology and passed on their advanced methods to our survey teams working in the Qaidam Basin. As a result, our work speed has increased several times. It is said that after using Hungarian instruments and scientific methods, the work is done faster, more economically, and more accurately.
    Comrades from the Hungarian Scientific and Technological Cooperation Bureau told me that they have technology but no resources, scientific innovation but often no practical application. Therefore, Hungarian scientific workers often feel wronged in their hearts. Now, with the socialist family, a country like China with vast land and abundant resources that needs technology everywhere, needs mutual assistance between fraternal countries.
    Hungary wants to trade with many countries, and its products are sold to various regions of the world. The Hungarian automobile factory once tried to build high-altitude cars, but there were no plateaus in the country for testing. Last year, China built the Kangzang Highway, and high-altitude cars from Hungary and Czechoslovakia were driven there for testing. For example, the telecommunications equipment manufacturing industries of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Germany want to improve the technology of adapting to tropical climates. China specially established the Tropical Telecommunications Equipment Research Institute in Guangzhou to facilitate their testing. Hungarian comrades said with emotion that this can only be done if we are regarded as one family.
    China and Hungary also exchange various blueprints and data. Hungary also learns from our experience in light industry and agriculture, openly sharing various production "secrets," learning from each other's strengths, and helping each other. Therefore, it promotes the common rise of the two countries' economies.
    The October counter-revolutionary incident caused huge economic losses to Hungary. Western countries stopped trading with Hungary, attempting to finally subdue Hungary economically. Socialist countries rushed to provide assistance. Our people provided 30 million rubles of free foreign exchange as unconditional aid and 100 million rubles of free foreign exchange as long-term loans. Socialist countries jointly helped Hungary overcome its difficulties.
    From this, it can be seen that the socialist family is not an empty phrase, but has rich and vivid content.
    In the ideological exchange between the two countries, in addition to various cultural measures and personal contacts, I saw that comrades in the Hungarian Party were greatly interested in Mao Zedong's Selected Works and the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" has received extraordinary attention in Hungary. This document has brought about a profound development in the relationship between the Chinese and Hungarian parties. The Hungarian comrades I have contacted, from the central to the local level, almost without exception, mention it, regarding it as the most timely ideological help from comrades.
    I also met many Hungarians who had been to China in Budapest, many of whom were non-Party members. How do they view China? In the Horthy era, the general public had never seen Chinese people, and didn't even know where China was on the globe. Intellectuals only saw the distorted image of Chinese people in the books of the comprador Lin Yutang. Now, the China they see is a mythical China, which surprises and moves them. After returning to their country, they have become enthusiastic propagandists, making those who have not been to China yearn for it.
    I visited the home of Rusznia Maria, who went to China last year with a folk music troupe. She fell madly in love with China. It is said that this is not a unique phenomenon for her. She infected her husband, who had not been to China, but in front of his friends, he could eloquently introduce the new China, and could fluently talk about all the details and names related to China. There is also a doctor who did not pay much attention to politics in the past, but after returning from China, his thinking changed. He said, "I also want to pursue such socialism." I asked what moved him in particular? It seems that they are all ordinary small things. One thing is seeing the cleanliness of Shanghai, because he is a doctor. Another thing is that when he bought something at the market, a vendor chased him out of the market to return the overpaid money to him. The third thing is seeing a rickshaw driver squatting on the ground learning to write. The Hungarian people have seen the most essential things about the Chinese people through these small things.
    Maria's husband is a lawyer. He told me that he and his friends also analyzed why Hungarians love China. He said that first, because China is a large Asian country that has been liberated after a long struggle; second, the leader is wise; third, the Party's policies are reasonable; fourth, the noble qualities of the Chinese people—honesty, humility, diligence, unity, discipline, and so on. They cited a series of examples to illustrate this. I said that these qualities are also the morality of communism, but they are not inherent in the Chinese people. This is the result of our Party's education of the people throughout the country in the past few years. This new style and new relationship were impossible in the old China. This is also something that every country in our socialist camp possesses.
    The foundation of friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people is unbreakable. The noble ideal of national and human liberation closely unites us. It has been consolidated in mutual learning, joint labor, mutual assistance, and shared difficulties over the years. Our friendship is not like a shadow that is only together on sunny days. It cannot be separated on cloudy days either.
    From Horthy's Hungary to socialist Hungary, from China under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang to China in the socialist era, how profound a change has taken place in the relationship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!

    我们永远在一起
    本报记者　胡济邦
    匈牙利是一个丰富多采的国家，它虽然遭受日耳曼化政策的四百年的外族统治，仍然保存了自己丰富的语言和文化、农村风习和民间艺术的优良传统。解放后，党在提高人民生活方面作了许多努力，这从它现有的高度文娱生活的水平中可以得到证明。匈牙利可以称为体育界的王国，风景幽美的疗养胜地，音乐、舞蹈之乡。此外，在各个城市的公园里和林荫道上都可以看到很多美丽可爱的儿童和妇女。我常想，假如没有西方敌人的干扰，这是一个多么美丽、幸福、快乐的国家呢！我到过北欧和西欧许多国家，但没有像匈牙利这样诱惑人。这不仅因为它是我们社会主义大家庭中一员，它的人民有着热情好客的习惯，同时它还有许多比西欧优越的东西。
    匈牙利是一个科学技术发达的国家，我看到匈牙利人民以自己这方面的特长热情地帮助我国的社会主义建设。我们也派了一批留学生学习它的各种专长。我参观过布达佩斯的一些工厂，现在至少有几十个工厂都接受了有关我国五年计划的定货。在十月事件后，我看到许多工人都为提高中国定货的质量而努力。例如，有几十年生产经验的红星拖拉机厂，今年的80％的出品，都是供给我国，该厂还专派了优秀技术员为我国训练出四千多名拖拉机手。
    当我国掀起合作化高潮时，匈牙利政府还赠送给我们一个拖拉机站，它将成为今后发展两国农业合作的据点。
    匈牙利的通讯器材，是世界闻名的。由于供给我们短波设备，各大城市的通话能力可以增加几倍到十几倍。此外，还供给我们微波设备，并帮助我们建立广播电台等。
    当匈牙利朋友知道我国在社会主义建设中迫切需要发展石油资源，需要大规模的地质勘探时，匈牙利的地球物理研究所接受我国的请求后，便大力支援。研究所把自己的和各大学、各研究机关的最优秀人才抽调出来组织了一个强大的队伍，把他们的几十年来苦心研究的成就，贡献给我国的社会主义建设。
    匈牙利专家们离开本国舒适的家，深入我国的偏僻地区，在旷野里、悬崖上，在炎热的夏天和风雪交加的冬季，辛勤不倦地工作。据说，由于交通困难，常常迟到深夜才回到宿舍。
    专家们不仅完成自己的任务，还教会了中国的徒弟掌握高深的技术，并把他们的先进方法传授到在柴达木工作的我国勘测队。结果，使我们的工作速度增加了几倍。据说，采用匈牙利的仪器和科学方法后，使工作作得又快、又省、又准确。
    匈牙利科技合作局的同志对我说，他们有技术，但没有资源，有科学创新，但常得不到实践。因此，匈牙利科学工作者的心灵深处常常感到委屈。现在，有了社会主义大家庭，像中国这样地大物博到处需要技术的国家，就需要各兄弟国家之间的互相援助。
    匈牙利要同许多国家进行贸易，它的产品销售到世界各个地区。匈牙利的汽车制造厂曾试造爬高汽车，但本国没有高原可以试验。去年中国建成了康藏公路，匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的爬高汽车都开去试验了。再如匈、捷、德的电讯器材制造业，想提高适应热带气候的技术，中国曾为了便于他们进行试验，特地在广州创立了热带电讯器材研究所。匈牙利同志感动地说，这是看作一家人，才能这样做。
    中国和匈牙利之间还交换各种蓝图和资料，匈牙利也学习我们轻工业和农业方面的经验，彼此公开各种生产的“密方”，取长补短，互通有无。因而，促进了两国经济的共同高涨。
    十月反革命事件使匈牙利遭到经济上的巨大损失，西方国家都停止了对匈牙利贸易，企图最后以经济制服匈牙利。社会主义各国则赶紧支援。我国人民提供三千万卢布的自由外汇为无偿援助，并以一亿卢布的自由外汇作为长期贷款。社会主义阵营各国共同帮助匈牙利度过困难。
    由此可见，社会主义大家庭并不是一句空洞的话，而是具有丰富生动的内容的。
    在两国思想交流中，除各种文化措施和个人接触外，我看到匈牙利党内同志对毛主席的选集和中共八大文件感到巨大兴趣。“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文，在匈牙利受到异常的重视。这个文件使中匈两党的同志的关系起了一个深刻的发展。我所接触过的匈牙利同志，从中央到地方，几乎没有例外地都要提到它，把它看作是同志的最及时的思想帮助。
    我在布达佩斯也会见过许多到过中国的匈牙利人，其中许多是党外人士，他们是怎样看中国的呢？在霍尔蒂时代，一般人民根本没有见过中国人，甚至不知道中国在地球哪一方。知识分子的脑子中，也只有从洋奴林语堂的书中看到过被丑化的中国人的形象。现在，他们看到的中国是神话般的中国，使他们惊奇，使他们感动。他们回国后，都变成了热心的宣传员，使没有去过中国的人听了都十分向往。
    我到过鲁斯尼亚·玛利亚的家，她去年和一个民间乐团一起到过中国，她狂热地爱上了中国。据说，这并不是她特有的现象，她又感染了她的丈夫，他没有去过中国，但在自己的朋友面前，他能够滔滔不绝地介绍新中国，能够流畅地讲出一切有关中国情况的细节和名称。还有一位医生，平时不大关心政治，但从中国回来后，他的思想改变了。他说：“这样的社会主义，我也要追求。”我问什么事情特别感动了他呢？听起来似乎都是一些平常的小事。一件事是看到上海市的清洁，因为他是医生。另一件事是他在市场上买东西时，一个小贩追出市场门要把多付的钱还给他。第三件事是看到三轮车夫蹲在地上学习写字。匈牙利人民已经通过这小事物看到了中国人民最本质的东西。
    玛利亚的丈夫是一位法学家，他告诉我说，他也和朋友们分析过匈牙利人为什么爱中国。他说，首先因为中国是经过长期斗争而获得解放的亚洲大国；第二是领袖英明；第三是党的政策合乎情理；第四是中国人的高贵品质——诚实、谦虚、勤恳、团结、守纪律等等。他们举了一系列的实例来说明。我说，这些品质也是共产主义的道德，但并不是中国人所固有的，这是我们党在解放后几年来教育全国人民所收到的成果。这种新作风、新关系是旧中国不可能有的，这也是我们社会主义阵营每个国家所具有的。
    中匈两国人民的友谊的基础是牢不可破的，为民族和人类解放的崇高理想把我们紧密地结合在一起，几年来，在相互学习、共同劳动、相互帮助和共患难中巩固起来了。我们的友谊并不像一个影子一样只在晴天在一起，它在阴天也一样不能分离。
    从霍尔蒂的匈牙利到社会主义的匈牙利，从国民党反动统治时代的中国到社会主义时代的中国，中匈两国人民的关系已起着多么深刻的变化啊！
