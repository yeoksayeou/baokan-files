Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: TASS reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko answered a question about the Syrian situation raised by a "Pravda" reporter at a press conference with Soviet and foreign journalists on the 10th. At this press conference, he also issued a statement on disarmament.

Gromyko pointed out that after certain foreign groups' anti-government conspiracy in Syria lost hope, they attempted to prepare armed provocations in countries neighboring Syria in order to use these countries to carry out armed intervention against Syria. What is happening in Syria now is none other than the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" at work. After exposing the conspiratorial activities of U.S. diplomat Henderson's recent visit to the Near and Middle East, Gromyko pointed out that the United States incited Arab countries such as Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon against Syria. The organizers of the conspiracy are looking for more reliable executors for their plans. In this regard, they are paying special attention to Turkey, wanting it to play the role of their gendarme in the Near and Middle East. We believe that if Turkey follows other people's ideas in the current situation and acts as the executor of an adventurous plan to start a war in the Middle East, it will be dangerous for Turkey. The Soviet government hopes to be able to believe that Turkish national activists are far-sighted and will not plunge Turkey into a situation that contains great misfortune for it. Some people hope that the military adventure against Syria can be limited to a local conflict, but it must be admitted that the danger of a local military conflict turning into a huge conflagration is now many times greater than before.

After refuting the fallacy that Syria is threatened by Soviet "communism," Gromyko said that the Soviet Union demands an end to imperialist encroachment on the independence of Arab countries and does not allow a war to be launched in this region, while the U.S. ruling circles grossly interfere in the internal affairs of countries in this region, attempting to once again put the shackles of colonialism on them. However, those who attempt to plunder other people's property should not forget that the era of colonialist enslavement and plunder is over. Those who advocate armed intervention in Syria's internal affairs should not forget the lessons of the failed adventure against Egypt last year.

Gromyko concluded by saying that as for the Soviet Union, which pursues a policy of peaceful coexistence and equal cooperation with all countries, it cannot turn a blind eye to events that pose a threat to peace and security in the Near and Middle East region. This is understandable, because when provocateurs waving the torch of war are active in areas directly adjacent to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union cannot but feel uneasy.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 11th: Most newspapers in the Syrian capital today published the warning issued by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko at a press conference on the 10th regarding the U.S. threat to peace in the Middle East under banner headlines on the front page.

An editorial in "Al-Nour" stated that Gromyko's warning was a blow to the imperialists and the most timely assistance for supporting the struggle of the Syrian and Arab people and preventing the brutal war planned by the U.S. imperialists.

An editorial in "Al-Jamahir" said: "Dulles is full of lies and intimidates Syria, but the Soviet warning has left him speechless and blocked his mouth with a stone."

Many Syrian newspapers also published commentaries from China's "People's Daily" and other newspapers denouncing the U.S. conspiracy to invade Syria. "Al-Jamahir" said that we are proud of the Chinese people's support for Syria.

### 苏外长就叙利亚局势警告美国挑衅者  不许在中东挥动战争火把

　　苏外长就叙利亚局势警告美国挑衅者
　　不许在中东挥动战争火把
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯10日在苏联和外国记者招待会上回答了“真理报”记者提出的关于叙利亚局势的问题。他在这次招待会上还发表了一项关于裁军问题的声明。
    葛罗米柯指出，某些外国集团在叙利亚策划反政府阴谋失去希望以后，便企图在叙利亚邻近的国家准备武装挑衅，以便利用这些国家来对叙利亚进行武装干涉。现在在叙利亚所发生的一切不是别的，正是“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”在作梗。葛罗米柯在揭露了美国外交官汉德逊最近在中近东访问的阴谋活动以后指出，美国唆使伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家反对叙利亚。阴谋组织者正在为他们的计划寻找更可靠的执行者。在这方面他们特别注意土耳其，想使它充当他们在中近东的宪兵性质的角色。我们觉得，如果土耳其在目前情况下遵循别人的主意，充当发动中东战争冒险计划的执行者这一角色的话，这对土耳其是危险的。苏联政府希望能够相信，土耳其国家活动家是有远见的，将不会使土耳其陷入对它蕴藏着莫大不幸的境地。有些人指望把反对叙利亚的军事冒险能够局限于地方性的冲突，但是必须承认，地方性的军事冲突变为巨大战火的危险性已经比以前严重许多倍。
    葛罗米柯在驳斥所谓叙利亚受到苏联“共产主义”威胁的谬论以后说，苏联要求终止帝国主义侵犯阿拉伯国家的独立，不允许在这个地区发动战争，而美国统治集团却粗暴地干涉这一地区的各国内政，企图再次给它们带上殖民主义的枷锁。但是，企图掠夺别人的财产的人不应当忘记，殖民主义奴役和掠夺的时代已经过去了。赞成武装干涉叙利亚内政的人不应该忘记去年对埃及的冒险失败的教训。
    葛罗米柯最后说，至于奉行各国和平共处及平等合作政策的苏联，它不能对这种对中近东地区的和平和安全造成某种威胁的事件置若罔闻。这是可以理解的，因为当挥动战争火把的挑衅者在与苏联直接接壤的地区活动的时候，苏联不能不产生不安。
    新华社大马士革11日电　叙利亚首都大多数报纸今天都在头版通栏标题下刊载了苏联外交部长葛罗米柯10日在记者招待会上就美国威胁中东和平发出的警告。
    “光明报”的社论说，葛罗米柯的警告是对帝国主义者的一个打击，而对于支援叙利亚和阿拉伯人民的斗争和防止美帝国主义者所策划的残暴的战争则是一种最及时的援助。
    “群众报”的社论说：“杜勒斯满口扯谎，并且大肆恫吓叙利亚，但是苏联的警告却使他哑口无言，用石头堵住了他的嘴。”
    叙利亚许多报纸还刊载了中国“人民日报”和其他报纸斥责美国阴谋侵略叙利亚的评论。“群众报”说，我们为中国人民对叙利亚的支持而感到骄傲。
