Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou -- Zhejiang Province will expand its winter grain crop area to over 11.8 million mu this year, an increase of 14.5% compared to last year. These winter crops include barley, wheat, broad beans, peas, potatoes, and others. On the one hand, winter fallow land should be utilized as much as possible; on the other hand, intercropping and relay cropping should be developed as much as possible under the condition of actively striving for agricultural time, and cultivation methods should be improved. In the arrangement of crop varieties, efforts should be made to adapt to regional characteristics, while also taking into account labor conditions and natural conditions.
