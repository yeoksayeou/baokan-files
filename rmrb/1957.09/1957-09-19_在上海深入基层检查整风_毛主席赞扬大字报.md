　　In Shanghai, Conducting In-Depth Inspection of Rectification at the Grassroots Level
　　Chairman Mao Praises Big-Character Posters
    (This dispatch from our Shanghai office, September 18, reporter Xi Ping): On the afternoon of the 17th, Chairman Mao arrived in Shanghai. In the evening, he met with Lu Wencai, First Secretary of the Huangpu District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Donghai, Secretary of the Shanghai Boiler Factory Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Qiu Qiqin, Principal of the Shanghai Power Technology School, to inspect and understand the situation of rectification and the great blooming and contending in grassroots units. At ten o'clock this morning, Chairman Mao visited the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, where the rectification and socialist education movement is in full swing.
    Accompanied by Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xia Zhengyan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the No. 1 Cotton Mill, and Huang Zonglin, the factory director, Chairman Mao visited the thousands of dazzling big-character posters pasted on both sides of the factory corridors. Chairman Mao was very interested in the big-character posters where workers were hotly debating various issues, often stopping to read them carefully and praising some of the posters for being well-written. There was a large cartoon that powerfully criticized certain erroneous statements. Chairman Mao stopped to look at it very carefully. He said that the quality of this big-character poster was very high. He also praised a big-character poster written by a group of veteran workers. In this big-character poster, the veteran workers expressed their intolerance of the opinions expressed by some people in the factory and demanded that the Party Committee immediately organize a debate to distinguish between right and wrong. Chairman Mao also pointed out some damaged big-character posters and said to Xia Zhengyan, the Party Committee Secretary: "They should be patched up."
    Chairman Mao's arrival brought great encouragement to the staff and workers who are working enthusiastically on both the rectification and production fronts. After work, the workers enthusiastically gathered around Chairman Mao, constantly cheering him, and Chairman Mao also frequently waved to the increasing number of workers.

　　在上海深入基层检查整风
　　毛主席赞扬大字报
    本报上海18日电　记者习平报道：17日下午，毛主席到达上海，晚间，接见了中共黄浦区委第一书记陆文才、中共上海锅炉厂委员会书记刘东海和上海动力技术学校校长仇启琴，检查和了解了基层单位整风和大鸣大放的情况。今天上午十点钟，毛主席在上海参观了正在轰轰烈烈地进行整风和社会主义教育运动的国营上海第一棉纺织厂。
    毛主席在中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施、国棉一厂党委书记夏正言、厂长黄宗林的陪同下，参观了贴满在工厂走道两旁数千张琳琅满目的大字报。工人对各种问题进行热烈争辩的大字报，毛主席很感兴趣，常常停下来仔细阅读，不时地称赞有些大字报写得好。有一幅大的漫画，有力地批评了某些错误言论，毛主席停下来看得很仔细。他说，这张大字报的质量很高。他还赞许了一群老工人写的一张大字报。在这张大字报上，老工人们对目前厂内某些人发表出来的言论，表示不能容忍，要求党委立即组织辩论，辨明大是大非。毛主席还指出一些破损了的大字报，对党委书记夏正言说：“应该把它们补贴好。”
    毛主席的到来，给正在整风和生产两条战线上热情地工作的职工们带来了极大的鼓舞。下了班的工人们热情地簇拥在毛主席的周围，不断地向他欢呼，毛主席也频频挥手向越来越多的工人致意。
