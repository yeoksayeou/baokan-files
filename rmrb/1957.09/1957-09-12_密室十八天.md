Eighteen Days in a Secret Room
Qinghai Daily Reporter Yang Ruize, after completing his studies at the Literature Training Institute organized by the Chinese Writers Association in Beijing, returned to Xining on May 3rd of this year, but he did not report to the newspaper office until May 20th. Where did he go during these eighteen days? It was only during a debate session of the anti-Rightist struggle that people questioned him, forcing him to reveal the secrets he and his accomplices were keeping.

It turns out that this Rightist element, while studying at the Literature Training Institute in Beijing last year, had secretly discussed with Han Qiufu (editor of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, a Rightist element), who was in Beijing to attend a meeting of literary journal editors, and Xie Linji, a cadre of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles who was studying with him, about setting up a "Nightingale Friendship Society," plotting to usurp the literary and artistic position in Qinghai Province and formulating a program and plan to realize this conspiracy. The eighteen days after his return to Xining were spent secretly carrying out specific activities according to the established plan.

In order to carry out clandestine conspiratorial activities, Yang Ruize arranged for his wife to move to another unknown place to live before returning to Xining from Beijing, so as to use this new residence as a secret room for their anti-Communist activities. In this secret room, he held three secret meetings with his accomplices in eighteen days. The first secret meeting was held from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM on May 11th. Although the Rightist element Ju Pu of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles had already known Yang Ruize, Xie Linji specially wrote a letter of introduction to convince Yang that Ju Pu was also part of their anti-Communist gang. At the secret meeting, they divided the work and decided to prepare separately to attack the Communist Party's policy on the ideological remolding of intellectuals and the preparatory work for "freedom of association." Before the meeting adjourned, Yang Ruize told those present the secret code for future meetings: "If my curtain is half-drawn, it means I am not at home or someone else is at my home, so don't come; if the curtain is fully drawn, it means I am alone and you can come."

The second secret meeting was held on May 12th. The Rightist element Ju Pu and the behind-the-scenes manipulator Wang Jiao (female, editor of the "Qinghai Lake" publication, consistently anti-Communist in history) attended the meeting. They discussed drafting a programmatic article entitled "'Qinghai Lake' Should Get Rid of Its Subordinate Status," plotting to usurp "Qinghai Lake," with Yang Ruize as the writer. Regarding this article, Wang Jiao drew on her counter-revolutionary experience, saying that the article should be written ambiguously, with punctuation marks deliberately misplaced, not too blatant, and should be like Hu Feng's writing style, so that it could achieve the anti-Communist purpose without being detected.

The third secret meeting was held on May 16th, and this group of political careerists discussed the article drafted by Yang Ruize.

After this article was written, it was handed over to Han Qiufu, a Rightist element of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. They agreed that Han Qiufu would use it as Han's speech at the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' rectification meeting on June 12th, and Yang Ruize would interview it as a reporter from Qinghai Daily and then publish it in the newspaper. On this day, they acted according to plan. On June 14th, this article drafted in the secret room was published on the front page of Qinghai Daily as news.

This article first negates the achievements of the "Qinghai Lake" publication, saying that "Qinghai Lake" is neither poisonous weed nor fragrant flower, but a sick flower, so no one reads it. Second, it flaunts the "integrity" of the publication. What they call "integrity" is that it should be "multi-faceted and multi-edged" towards the Communist Party, and it should have "combativeness." Third, it opposes the appointment of the editor-in-chief by the Party Committee, and heaps all kinds of crimes on the editor-in-chief Cheng Xiushan, with the aim of driving Cheng Xiushan away. Fourth, it wants the "Qinghai Lake" publication to get rid of its "subordinate status," meaning it wants to break away from the leadership of the Communist Party. Fifth, it advocates novelty and distinct characteristics. Sixth, it calls for a habit of "highly democratic" and "fully free" lifestyles, saying that if the "Qinghai Lake" society is full of poisonous weeds, then it should be run as a poisonous weed publication and compete with other fragrant flower publications.

After the insidious conspiracy of this group of Rightist elements was exposed, it aroused great anger among people in Qinghai's journalistic and literary circles. Now Qinghai's journalistic and literary circles are further pursuing this group of Rightist elements.

　　密室十八天
　　新华社记者　程光远
    青海日报记者杨瑞泽在北京中国作家协会举办的文学讲习所学习完了以后，在今年5月3日回到西宁，但他直到5月20日才去报社上班。这十八天的时间，他到那里去了呢？在一次反右派斗争辩论会上，大家质问他才不得不道出他和他的同伙的秘密。
    原来这个右派分子去年在北京文学讲习所学习期间，就曾和到北京参加文学期刊编辑会议的韩秋夫（省文联编辑、右派分子）以及同他一起学习的省文联干部谢林基秘密研究过筹办“夜莺之友社”，阴谋篡夺青海省文艺阵地，制定出实现这个阴谋的纲领和计划。这次他回西宁后十八天，就是根据既定计划秘密进行具体活动。
    为了进行见不得天日的阴谋活动，杨瑞泽由北京回西宁前就安排他爱人搬到另外一个不被人知道的地方去住，以便把这个新住处作为他们进行反共活动的密室。就在这个密室里，他在十八天当中，和他的同伙一连开了三次秘密会议。第一次秘密会议时间是5月11日下午三点到五点。省文联的右派分子剧谱虽然早已认识杨瑞泽，但为了要杨相信剧谱为他们的反共同伙，还特地由谢林基写了一封介绍信带去。他们在秘密会议上进行了分工，决定分别就攻击共产党关于知识分子思想改造政策，和“自由结社”的筹备工作做准备。临散会时，杨瑞泽把以后见面的暗号告诉到会者：“如果我的窗帘拉一半，说明我不在家或有别人在我家，就不要来；如果把窗帘全部拉开，说明只我一人，就可以来。”
    第二次秘密会议的时间是5月12日，右派分子剧谱和幕后操纵人“青海湖”刊物编辑王皎（女、历史上一贯反共）都参加了会议。他们商议起草一篇题为“‘青海湖’应该脱离附庸地位”的纲领性的文章，阴谋篡夺“青海湖”，由杨瑞泽执笔。对这篇文章，王皎搬出了她的反革命经验，说是文章要写得含糊一些，标点符号故意标错，不要太露骨，要像胡风的笔法一样，这样既达到反共的目的，又不会被人识破。
    第三次秘密会议时间是5月16日，这一伙政治野心家讨论了杨瑞泽起草的文章。
    这篇文章写好以后，交给了省文联的右派分子韩秋夫。他们商量好让韩秋夫在6月12日省文联整风会议上做为韩的发言稿，杨瑞泽以青海日报记者的身份去采访，然后把它在报上登出来。到了这天，果然照计而行。6月14日，这篇由在密室草拟的文章就被作为新闻登在青海日报的一版上。
    这篇文章首先否定“青海湖”刊物的成绩，说“青海湖”既不是毒草，也不是香花，而是一朵病花，因此无人看。第二，标榜刊物的“气节”。他们所谓“气节”，就是对共产党要“多棱多刃”，要有“战斗性”。第三，反对主编由党委委派，把各式各样的罪名都加到主编程秀山身上，目的在于赶走程秀山。第四，要“青海湖”刊物脱离“附庸地位”，意思就是要脱离共产党的领导。第五，提倡标新立异，各有千秋。第六，要习惯“高度民主”和“充分自由”的生活方式，说如果“青海湖”社都是毒草，那就办成一个毒草的刊物，和其他的香花刊物争鸣。
    这一伙右派分子的奸险的阴谋被揭露出来后，引起青海新闻界文艺界人士的极大愤怒。现在青海新闻界文艺界正在进一步追击这批右派分子。
