　　Going to the Countryside

　　(This is a conversation I overheard on the last No. 2 trolleybus the other night.)

　　A: Going back so late, is it for a counter-rightist meeting?

　　B: No, it's a farewell party. We're sending off a group of comrades to the countryside.

　　A: How many are going from your organization?

　　B: Fifty people are going this year, and there will be a second batch next year.

　　A: So many going, won't it affect the work?

　　B: Everyone will tighten their belts, no problem. … The leadership approved my going down next year.

　　A: Really? That's good. What about the children?

　　B: If we can, we'll take them down with us so they can learn to work from a young age. When they grow up, I think they'll definitely be stronger than our generation. Are you getting off? Where are you going?

　　A: To the train station, also to send off comrades from the section to the countryside!

    到农村去
    （这是前天晚上在末班的二路电车上听到的一段对话）
　　甲：这么晚回去，开反右派大会？
　　乙：不是，开欢送会。欢送一批同志到农村去。
　　甲：你们机关去多少？
　　乙：今年去五十个人，明年还有第二批。
　　甲：去那么多，工作不受影响？
　　乙：大家紧一紧，没问题。……领导上批准了我明年下去。
　　甲：是么？那可好。孩子咋办？
　　乙：能带就带下去，让他从小就学会劳动，长大了，我看一定比我们这一代强。你下了？上哪儿去？
　　甲：到火车站去，也是送科里同志到农村去！
