Building a New Socialist Countryside is the Glorious Task of Educated Youth: Large Numbers of Students in Liaoning and Jiangsu Head Towards a New Life – Participating in Production

    (Our dispatch) According to incomplete statistics, more than 135,600 primary and secondary school graduates in Liaoning Province have participated in agricultural production. Among them, there are 1,857 senior high school graduates and more than 33,000 junior high school graduates.

    This year, ideological education for primary and secondary school graduates has been relatively thorough, especially as the graduates have been educated through the anti-Rightist struggle, which has greatly improved their ideological awareness. Among the graduates who did not pass the school entrance examinations, most of those whose families are in the countryside have already returned home to engage in production; of those whose families are in the cities, more than 4,000 have also participated in agricultural production. Many cadres working in the cities are actively encouraging and supporting their children to participate in agricultural production. Huang Da, Deputy Governor of Liaoning Province, Zhang Hongquan, Deputy County Head of Zhuanghe County, and Qu Dongchang, Chief Engineer of Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine, have all encouraged their children to go to the countryside to engage in production. Li Yugong, County Head of Xinjin County, moved his entire family to the countryside to facilitate the participation of his two children who graduated from junior high school and primary school this summer in agricultural production. Under his influence, 76 graduates from towns and cities in the county have now gone to the countryside to engage in production.

    Primary and secondary school graduates participating in agricultural production have been warmly welcomed by the agricultural cooperatives. The agricultural cooperatives generally assign them some light work first, and in the labor process, the veteran cooperative members patiently teach them agricultural production techniques. Some agricultural cooperatives have set up spare-time technical study classes, with veteran farmers and comrades from the agricultural technology extension stations giving lectures and helping them and other young farmers to learn techniques. After participating in agricultural production, the students are generally able to work diligently, not afraid of getting dirty or tired, and do whatever work is assigned to them. The 54 primary and secondary school graduates who participated in the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Fushun City worked hard and well, and the veteran cooperative members called them "little tigers." Huang Jianxing, the daughter of Deputy Governor Huang Da, has been working selflessly since she participated in agricultural production. After a period of labor, the students have become more passionate about agricultural production, and many have expressed their willingness to serve the country's agricultural construction cause for a long time. Zai Qixun, a junior high school graduate from the Qianjin Cooperative in Shenyang City, recently brought his mother from the city to settle down in the countryside. Zhou Zhengxin, a senior high school graduate from the Yufa Agricultural Cooperative in Henan Township, Lingyuan County, and Liu Shuhua, Deng Yuzhen and other seven junior high school graduates from the Xiaoshubu Agricultural Cooperative in Dashubu Township, Shenyang County, have all set their own long-term plans and are determined to become the first generation of cultured farmers in the country.

    (Our dispatch) Party and government leaders and relevant departments in various parts of Jiangsu Province are actively arranging for middle and primary school graduates who have not been admitted to schools to go into life, most of whom are engaged in agricultural production and embarking on the most glorious post called for by the country.

    Before the school enrollment results were announced this year, working guidance committees for middle and primary school graduates were established in various parts of Jiangsu Province, and responsible comrades from the Party and government gave many speeches and reports to the graduating students. Party committees at all levels have also conducted investigations, pilot projects and comprehensive arrangements and plans for arranging graduate work. After the results of higher and secondary schools were announced, Party and government leaders at all levels, in addition to organizing teachers, student parents and agricultural cooperative cadres to comfort and encourage them, also made proper arrangements for them to participate in agricultural production and other productive labor and self-study activities based on the needs of the country and their own wishes.

    The vast majority of middle and primary school graduates in Jiangsu Province who were not admitted or did not continue their studies this year have been arranged to engage in agricultural production. In Huaiyin County, more than 5,000 middle and primary school graduates whose families were in the countryside who were not admitted were all incorporated into the production teams of agricultural cooperatives and directly participated in field labor. Of the 7,200 middle and primary school graduates in Nantong County who did not pass the school entrance examinations, 6,990 have been placed in production posts. Many graduates in cities and market towns have also responded to the government's call to participate in agricultural production. In Nanjing City, 245 people have gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and thousands of graduates have applied to participate in agricultural production. In Changzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, Wuxi, Taizhou, Qingjiang and other cities, more than 1,000 graduates living in cities have already participated in agricultural production and are applying to participate in agricultural production.

    The participation of middle and primary school graduates in agricultural production has received enthusiastic support and care from all sides. Nanjing City organized a 15,000-person meeting to send off graduates to the countryside, and responsible comrades from the province and city spoke at the meeting to congratulate them on embarking on new construction posts. Many parents prepared daily necessities and farm tools for their children, and some personally sent their children to the countryside to farm. Chengjiang Town in Jiangyin County and Yushan Town in Kunshan County held warm send-offs for graduates going to the countryside. Colorful arches were set up in the city, and the masses beat gongs and drums to send the graduates to the agricultural cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives also organized welcomes for the middle and primary school graduates participating in agricultural production, made proper arrangements for their production and life, and assigned skilled farmers in the production teams to provide them with technical guidance.

    After the graduates participated in agricultural production, their enthusiasm for labor was very high. Ling Yongxin, a junior high school graduate from Shanghai County, has already earned more than 200 work points for the agricultural cooperative, and actively participates in accounting and copying work in the evening. Fifteen graduates from Douzheng Township in Rugao County accumulated 1,201 catties of green fertilizer in one day. The 24 graduates in Nanjing City who participated in the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative were able to earn more than five work points per day in the first week. They mingled with the farmers in labor, production and life, and many graduates took the initiative to help the farmers grind flour, carry water and cut pigweed.

    Appropriate arrangements have also been made in various places for some junior high school and senior primary school graduates who are young and lack the conditions for labor and employment. Wuxi City is preparing to run a private junior high school and nine tutorial classes, and is also running a youth self-study cultural broadcasting school, planning to organize 1,800 to 2,000 junior high school graduates to study on their own. Xuzhou City plans to set up 54 junior high school tutorial classes to absorb 2,500 senior primary school graduates to participate in learning. (Yao Gan, Mu Jiakun)

    建设新农村是知识青年的光荣任务
    辽宁、江苏大批学生走向新生活——参加生产
    本报讯  据不完全统计，辽宁省已有十三万五千六百多名本届中小学毕业生参加了农业生产。其中有高中毕业生一千八百五十七人，初中毕业生三万三千多人。
    由于今年对中小学毕业生的思想教育比较深入，特别是毕业生们经受了反右派斗争的教育，因而思想觉悟大大提高。在没有考取学校的毕业生中，家在农村的，大都已经回家生产；家在城市的，也有四千多人参加了农业生产。很多在城市工作的干部都积极鼓励和支持自己的子女参加农业生产。辽宁省副省长黄达、庄河县副县长张洪权、阜新海州露天矿总工程师曲东昌等同志，都鼓励自己的子女下乡生产。新金县县长李玉功为便于今年暑假在初中和小学毕业的两个孩子参加农业生产，特别把全家搬到乡下。在他的影响下，目前全县已有七十六名家在城镇的毕业生下乡生产。
    参加农业生产的中小学毕业生受到了农业社的热烈欢迎。农业社一般都先分配一些轻便的活给他们干，在劳动中，老社员耐心地教给他们有关农业生产的技术。有的农业社则成立业余技术学习班，由老农和农业技术推广站的同志给他们讲课、帮助他们和其他青年农民学习技术。学生们参加农业生产后，一般都能勤勤恳恳地劳动，不怕脏、不怕累，给什么活就干什么活。参加抚顺市兴光农业社的五十四名中小学毕业生干得猛，干得好，老社员管他们叫“小老虎”。副省长黄达的女儿黄建行，参加农业生产以后一直是忘我地劳动。学生们经过一个阶段的劳动，更加热爱农业生产了，很多人表示愿意长期为祖国的农业建设事业服务。沈阳市前进社初中毕业生载启训，最近已经从市内把母亲接到农村安家立业。凌源县河南乡裕发农业社高中毕业生周正心，沈阳县大淑堡乡小淑堡农业社刘淑华、邓玉珍等七名初中毕业生都订了自己努力的远景规划，立志要做祖国第一代有文化的农民。
    本报讯  江苏省各地党政领导和有关部门积极安排未考取学校的中、小学毕业生走向生活，其中绝大部分投入农业生产，走上国家号召的最光荣的岗位。
    今年学校招生发榜之前，江苏省各地成立了中、小学毕业生工作指导委员会，党政负责同志都对应届毕业生做了多次演讲和报告。各级党委并对安排毕业生工作作了调查、试点和全面的安排规划。高等、中等学校发榜后，各级党政领导除组织教师、学生家长和农业社干部，对他们进行安慰和鼓励外，并根据国家需要和他们的志愿，妥善安排他们参加农业生产和其他各项生产劳动和自修活动。
    江苏省今年的未被录取或没有升学的中、小学毕业生绝大部分都已安排投入了农业生产。淮阴县家在农村的五千多名中、小学毕业生未录取的，即全部编入农业社的生产队，直接参加田间劳动。南通县没有考取学校的中、小学毕业生七千二百人，已有六千九百九十人安置到生产岗位上去。很多城市和集镇上的毕业生也都纷纷响应政府号召参加农业生产。南京市下乡参加农业生产的已有二百四十五人，还有成千的毕业生报名申请参加农业生产。常州、苏州、镇江、徐州、无锡、泰州、清江等市，家住城市的毕业生已经参加农业生产和正在申请参加农业生产的有一千多人。
    中、小学毕业生参加农业生产得到各方面的热烈支持和关怀。南京市组织了一万五千人的大会欢送毕业生下乡，省、市负责同志都到会讲了话，祝贺他们走上新的建设岗位。很多毕业生家长为孩子准备了日常生活用品和农具，有的亲自送自己的孩子下乡种田。江阴县澄江镇和昆山县玉山镇对下乡毕业生举行了热烈的欢送，城里搭起彩牌坊，群众敲锣打鼓欢送毕业生到农业社去。很多农业社也对参加农业生产的中小学毕业生，组织了欢迎，对他们的生产、生活各方面都作了妥善的安置，并在生产队内，委派熟练的农民给他们以技术指导。
    毕业生参加农业生产以后，劳动热情都很高，上海县初中毕业生凌永欣已为农业社做了二百多个工分，晚上还积极参加算账抄写工作。如皋县斗争乡十五个毕业生在一天以内，就积绿肥一千二百零一斤。南京市参加幸福农业社的二十四位毕业生，在开始一周内，每天都能做五个工分以上。他们在劳动生产和生活上和农民打成一片，很多毕业生主动帮助农民推磨、挑水、割猪草。
    各地对那些年龄小、缺乏劳动就业条件的部分初中、高小毕业生，也作了适当的安排。无锡市正筹办民办初中一所、补习班九所，并举办青年自学文化广播学校，计划组织初中毕业生一千八百人到二千人自学。徐州市拟筹办初中补习班五十四班，吸收二千五百个高小毕业生参加学习。 （姚干、穆嘉琨）
