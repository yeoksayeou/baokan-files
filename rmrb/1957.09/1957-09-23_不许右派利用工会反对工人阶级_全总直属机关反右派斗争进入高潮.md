	The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Directly Affiliated Organs' Anti-Rightist Struggle Enters Climax

	(Our report) The anti-Rightist struggle in more than forty units, including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the national committees of various industrial trade unions, and the ACFTU's newspapers, publishing houses, and cadre schools in Beijing, is entering a climax.

	The rightists who have been exposed include Gao Yuan (Party member, Director of the Archives Department of the General Office), Zheng Huanyu, Zhang Zengsan, Ding Xun (teacher in the Cultural Teaching and Research Section of the ACFTU Cadre School), Wang Qing (Deputy Director of the Fourth Editorial Office of the Workers' Publishing House), Zhang Zhaolin (Deputy Editor of the Workers' Daily supplement), Yang Jin (clerk in the Wages Department of the Seamen's Union), Qi Jiayi (Deputy Section Chief of the Finance Department of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union), Zhuang Boqing (clerk in the Wages Department of the ACFTU), Wang Fukang (clerk in the Production Department of the Heavy Industry Union), Jin Xin (general affairs clerk of the Workers' Daily), and others.

	These rightists have made trade union organizations their primary targets of attack. Gao Yuan, a rightist within the Party with sixteen years of Party membership, is a backbone element in attacking the Party. He maliciously attacked the nature, role, and tasks of trade unions. He said, "The role of trade unions can only be considered from the workers' demands on the trade union, not from the perspective of the Party and the state," and also said, "Pillar, link, and school are the roles added to the trade union by the Party." On the relationship between the Party and the trade union, he emphasized that "the Party's position and the class position are different," and "the trade union can be under the leadership of the Party, and the trade union can also not be under the leadership of the Party." In the relationship between the trade union and the administration, he advocated "playing against each other," fundamentally opposing the trade union's regulatory role in handling contradictions among the people. In the relationship between the trade union and the masses, he incited discord by saying that the current "trade union cannot represent the workers, and the workers do not believe in the trade union." In order to split the workers' movement and disintegrate the trade union, he also advocated that "workers can organize their own trade unions and do not necessarily have to join the All-China Federation of Trade Unions."

	The rightist Zhang Zhaolin, using the pen names "Huanhuaxi" and "Zhaoling," imitated "Caomu Pian" and published "Xia Chong Pian" and "Strange Book Classification Method," making extremely vicious attacks on the Party.

	In "Strange Book Classification Method," he wrote: "Some leaders of factories, mines, and institutions have simply divided cadres and workers into two categories: progressive and backward... Among the so-called progressive people, there may be Liang Shiqiu, and among the 'backward elements,' there may well be Xia Yan?" He attempted to attack activists and the Party's cadre policy through this.

	Beginning in early July, various units successively launched counterattacks against the rightists. The broad masses actively participated in the battle. They used forms such as big-character posters and large and small debate meetings to conduct reasoned struggles against the rightists. To date, more than 3,300 large and small meetings have been held, 11,000 big-character posters have been produced, 319 issues of blackboard newspapers have been published, and more than 130 cartoons have been created, totaling 3,030,000 words. In order to conduct reasoned struggles, many people have restudied many theoretical books and policy and legal documents. For example, in order to refute the rightist Gao Yuan's theory, the staff of the General Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the teachers of the teaching and research section of the ACFTU Cadre School made systematic preparations and reread the articles on the workers' movement by Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Liu Shaoqi. Therefore, they were able to thoroughly refute Gao Yuan. Liu Yunyan of the ACFTU Cadre School said: "The trade union 'theory' of rightists like Gao Yuan is the reactionary thought of the bourgeoisie, and it corrodes the workers' movement." At the debate meetings, many people refuted the rightists with their own personal experiences. Zhou Keya, a teacher at the ACFTU Cadre School, said that the rightist Zhang Zengsan, in slandering the Party's cadre policy as "the theory of sole reliance on class origin," said: "Zhou Keya, who has received seven or eight years of education, should also be treated as a landlord element," which is pure nonsense. After I came to the school, I took on important teaching work, was elected as a member of the Youth League branch, and was listed by the Party as a development target. Is this "treating me as a landlord element"? Six public employees spoke at the debate meeting of the Workers' Publishing House. Shen Juzhang, an old worker who had experienced the oppression of the Qing Dynasty, warlords, the Kuomintang, and the Japanese puppet regime, said that today the elderly have guaranteed lives, which was fundamentally impossible in the old society. Why did the rightist Wang Qing say that "people's lives have not improved" and that the Communist Party is "cold and ruthless"?

### 不许右派利用工会反对工人阶级  全总直属机关反右派斗争进入高潮

    不许右派利用工会反对工人阶级
    全总直属机关反右派斗争进入高潮
    本报讯　全国总工会、各产业工会全国委员会以及全总所属在北京的报社、出版社和干部学校等四十多个单位反右派斗争正进入高潮。
    已经揭露出来的右派分子有高元（党员、办公厅档案处长）、郑焕宇、张增三、丁勋（全总干校文化教研室教员）、王青（工人出版社第四编辑室副主任）、张照邻（工人日报副刊编辑）、杨晋（海员工会工资部干事）、戚家仪（邮电工会财务部副科长）、庄博清（全总工资部干事）、王福康（重工业工会生产部干事）、靳鑫（工人日报总务科员）等。
    这些右派分子把工会组织当成了攻击的主要目标。有着十六年党龄的党内右派分子高元是向党进攻的骨干。他对工会的性质、作用、任务进行了恶意的攻击。他说“工会的作用只能从工人对工会的要求来考虑，不能从党和国家方面来考虑”，还说“支柱、纽带、学校是党加给工会的作用”。他在党和工会的关系上强调“党的立场和阶级立场就有所不同，“工会可以在党的领导下，工会也可以不在党的领导下。”他在工会与行政关系上主张“唱对台戏”，根本反对工会在处理人民内部矛盾问题上的调节作用。他在工会与群众的关系上则挑拨说现在的“工会不能代表工人，工人不相信工会”。他为了达到分裂工人运动，瓦解工会，还主张“工人可以自己组织工会，不一定参加全国总工会”。
    右派分子张照邻以笔名“浣花溪”和“昭灵”仿照“草木篇”发表了“夏虫篇”和“奇怪的图书分类法”，对党作了非常恶毒的攻击。
    他在“奇怪的图书分类法”里写道：“有些厂矿和机关的领导上曾把干部与工人简单划分为进步与落后两大类……。那所谓进步的一类人中怕也会有梁实秋，而‘落后分子’里面，未尝没有夏衍吧？”企图借此来攻击积极分子和党的干部政策。
    7月上旬开始，各单位先后向右派分子展开了反击。广大群众都积极参加了战斗。他们运用了大字报、大小辩论会等形式向右派分子进行了说理斗争。到目前为止已开大小会三千三百多次，出大字报一万一千张，黑板报三百一十九期，漫画一百三十多幅，共有三百零三万字。为了展开说理斗争许多人重新学习许多理论书籍和政策法令文件。如为了驳斥右派分子高元的理论，全总办公厅和全总干校教研室的教员都有专人作了系统的准备，重新阅读了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东和刘少奇有关工人运动的文章。因此能够给高元以彻底驳斥。全总干校刘云雁说：“像高元这样右派的工会‘理论’，是资产阶级的反动思想，它腐蚀工人运动。”在辩论会上，许多人以自己的切身经历反驳了右派分子。全总干校教员周克亚说，右派分子张增三在诬蔑党的干部政策是“唯成份论”中说：“周克亚受了七、八年的教育也要按地主分子论”，这纯粹是胡说，我来学校以后担任了重要的教学工作，被选为团支部委员，并且被党列为发展对象，难道这是“当地主分子看待吗”。工人出版社在辩论会上有六个公务人员发了言。曾经历过清朝、军阀、国民党、日伪统治压迫的老工人沈巨彰说，今天老年人生活有保障，若在旧社会这是根本办不到的。右派分子王青为什么说“人民生活没有改善”，共产党“冷酷无情”呢？
