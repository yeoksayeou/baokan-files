Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 25th. In Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, 462 poor peasant cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives with poor peasants as the backbone have persisted in the socialist position in the countryside amidst the great wave of withdrawals and dissolutions of cooperatives that occurred a few months ago. Among them, ten cooperatives have recently been commended by the Lufeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party as heroic cooperatives in the county.

During May and June of this year, the evil trend of withdrawing from and dismantling cooperatives was rampant in the rural areas of Lufeng County due to the instigation of bad elements. However, in Tanxi District, where the evil trend of withdrawing from and dismantling cooperatives was at its peak, ten agricultural cooperatives with poor peasants as the strong leading backbone were not affected and not a single household withdrew. In addition, 47 cooperatives in this district have persisted in running the cooperatives by resolutely implementing the class policy of relying on poor peasants. In Shengang Township, Tanxi District, there is a Houlong Cooperative. Fifteen cooperatives around it collapsed in a gust of evil wind, but the fourteen poor peasant households in this Houlong Cooperative still firmly and actively united to persuade the members and help them solve their difficulties in life, leading the whole cooperative to complete the summer planting task ahead of schedule and preserve this socialist position. Dongguang Cooperative in Fuzhou Township, Juntan District, when the other ten cooperatives in the township were all in turmoil, 44 poor peasant households formed a poor peasant group and used the method of linking poverty with poverty and heart to heart to persuade other members, exposing the conspiracy of bad elements to dismantle the cooperative, and finally protected the cooperative. The whole cooperative actively carried out production.

In this struggle to uphold the socialist position, many poor peasants have come forward and played an active leading role. When bad elements incited members of the Futou Agricultural Cooperative in Fuying Township to attempt to loot the cooperative's grain, the cooperative director, poor peasant Zhuang Youyin, personally guarded the granary, reasoned with the masses face-to-face, dissuaded them, and stopped this illegal behavior. At the mobilization meeting to dismantle the cooperative presided over by bad elements, Zhuang Youyin heroically exposed the conspiratorial faces of bad elements attempting to incite the dismantling of the cooperative on the spot, turning the dismantling meeting into a meeting to protect the cooperative, so that the cooperative was finally not dismantled. The poor peasant Lin Shuilin of Gonghou Cooperative in Xin'gang Township was struggled against for three nights at meetings by bad elements who incited the dismantling of the cooperative, but he still firmly refused to dismantle the cooperative and ran the cooperative together with seven poor peasant households. Zhang Qian (family member of a revolutionary martyr), director of the Fourth Agricultural Cooperative of Xinbu Township, firmly refused the threats and inducements of bad elements, and when only one ox was left after the withdrawing households pulled away twelve oxen, he still ran the cooperative together with the thirty poor peasant households in the cooperative.

    贫农带头驱散拆社歪风
    坚持农村社会主义阵地
    陆丰四百多农业社作出好榜样
    新华社广州25日电　广东省陆丰县有四百六十二个贫农社和以贫农为骨干的农业社，在几个月以前发生的退社散社大风浪中坚持了农村的社会主义阵地。其中十个社最近被中共陆丰县委员会表扬为全县英雄社。
    今年五、六月间，陆丰县农村由于坏分子的煽动，退社散社的歪风很盛。但是就在退社散社歪风最盛的潭西区，却有十个以贫农为坚强领导骨干的农业社始终没有受到影响，没有一户退社；另外这个区还有四十七个社由于坚决贯彻依靠贫农的阶级政策，也一直坚持把社办下来。潭西区深港乡有个后龙社，它四围有十五个社都在一阵歪风中垮了，但是这个后龙社的十四户贫农，仍然坚定地积极串连说服社员，帮助社员解决生活困难，带动全社提前完成夏种任务，把这个社会主义阵地坚持了下来。军潭区浮州乡东光社，在全乡其余的十个社都闹散社的时候，四十四户贫农成立起贫农小组，以贫连贫、心串心的办法，分别说服其他社员，揭露了坏分子企图拆散社的阴谋，终于保护了社。全社积极地搞好了生产。
    在这次坚持社会主义阵地的斗争中，许多贫农都挺身而出，起了积极带头的作用。浮英乡浮头农业社在坏分子煽动社员企图抢夺社里粮食的时候，社主任、贫农庄友银亲自守住粮仓，同群众面对面地说理，劝阻群众，制止了这种不法行为。在坏分子主持的散社动员大会上，庄友银又英勇地当场揭露坏分子企图煽动散社的阴谋面目，把散社会变成了保社会，使这个社终于没有拆散。新港乡宫后社的贫农林水令，被煽动散社的坏分子开会斗了三个晚上，他仍然坚决拒绝散社，并且和七户贫农一起把社办了下来。新布乡第四农业社主任、贫农张骞（革命烈士家属），坚决拒绝坏分子的威胁利诱，当退社户拉走了十二头耕牛只剩下一头耕牛时，他仍然同全社三十户贫农把社办下来。
