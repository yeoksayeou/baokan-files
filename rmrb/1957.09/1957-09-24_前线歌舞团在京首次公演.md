	Frontline Song and Dance Troupe Gives First Performance in Beijing
	The predecessor of the Frontline Song and Dance Troupe was the New Fourth Army Battlefield Service Troupe and the "Frontline," "Resist the Enemy," "Dawn," "Huainan Masses" and other theater troupes affiliated with the troops. Combativeness and mass character are their characteristics. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they cooperated with the struggle at that time, creating and performing operas such as "Production Mutual Aid" and "Under Hucheng Bridge", active on the battlefields north and south of the Yangtze River. In 1946, they merged into the East China Field Army Cultural Troupe, creating and performing square song and dance dramas "The Great Turnaround," "Love the People on the Frontline," and songs such as "Huaihai Campaign Suite." In recent years, in the struggles of defending the motherland's coastal defense, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and defending socialist construction, they have created and performed operas "Azure Sea Red Flag," "The Fiancee," dance dramas "Jin Zhongming's Family" and "The Little Girl of Bachimen," and songs such as "Coastal Artillery."
	The song and dance program and the four-act opera "Hongxia" performed in Beijing this time are their new works in recent years.
	Musical dances will be performed from the 21st. "Hongxia" will be performed from the 26th. Hongxia is the name of a tenant farmer's daughter. Her brave and wise heroic deeds are widely circulated. The plot is set twenty years ago in the Jiangnan Soviet area, under the leadership of the Communist Party, people lived a happy life, and the love life of Hongxia and Red Guard Zhao Zhigang began. Then, the White Bandit army invaded the area, forcing Hongxia to lead the way. She used many ingenious methods and finally led the White army into our army's position, encircling and annihilating the White Bandit army. After she rescued Zhao Zhigang and the masses, she heroically sacrificed herself. The opera absorbs the essence of folk songs and local operas in the East China region in its music, so the musical melody and singing style have strong local characteristics and uniqueness. The performance is quite successful.

    前线歌舞团在京首次公演
    前线歌舞团的前身是新四军战地服务团和部队所属“前线”、“抗敌”、“拂晓”、“淮南大众”等剧团。战斗性、群众性是他们的特色。在抗日战争时期，他们配合当时的斗争，创作和演出了歌剧“生产大互助”、“护城桥下”等，活跃在长江南北的战场上。1946年他们合并为华东野战军文工团，创作和演出了广场歌舞剧“大翻身”、“火线爱民”以及歌曲“淮海战役组歌”等。最近几年来，在保卫祖国海防、抗美援朝、保卫社会主义建设等各个阶段的斗争中，他们创作和演出了歌剧“碧海红旗”、“未婚妻”，舞剧“金仲铭之家”“八尺门的小姑娘”以及歌曲“海岸炮兵”等。
    这次来京演出的歌舞节目和四幕歌剧“红霞”，是他们近年来的新作品。
    21日起公演音乐舞蹈。26日起演出“红霞”。红霞是一位佃户的女儿的名字。她的勇敢和智慧的英雄事迹到处流传。剧情是以二十年前江南苏区在共产党的领导下，人们过着喜庆幸福的生活，红霞姑娘同赤卫队员赵志刚的爱情生活开始的。接着，白匪军进扰这个地区，逼着红霞带路，她用了很多巧妙的办法，终于把白军引入我军阵地，围歼了白匪军。她自己在救出了赵志刚和群众之后，也就壮烈地牺牲了。歌剧由于在音乐上吸取了华东地区民歌及地方戏曲的精华，因之在音乐旋律的进行和唱法上具有浓厚的地方特色和独到之处。在演出上是相当成功的。
