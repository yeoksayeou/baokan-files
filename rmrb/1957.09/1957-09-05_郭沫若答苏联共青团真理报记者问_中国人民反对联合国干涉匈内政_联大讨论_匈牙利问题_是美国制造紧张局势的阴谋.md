    Guo Moruo Answers Questions from Soviet Komsomolskaya Pravda Reporter
    Chinese People Oppose UN Interference in Hungarian Internal Affairs
    UN General Assembly Discussion of the "Hungarian Question" is a Conspiracy by the United States to Create Tension
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Soviet Komsomolskaya Pravda reporter in China, V. Kassisis, asked Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, several questions regarding the United Nations General Assembly convening a special session to discuss the so-called "Hungarian question." Guo Moruo answered these questions. The following are the reporter's questions and Guo Moruo's answers.
    Question: What is your opinion on the United Nations General Assembly convening a special meeting to discuss the so-called "Hungarian question?"
    Answer: This is interference in Hungary's internal affairs. Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations has once again committed an illegal crime.
    Question: What is your opinion on the content of the "Special Committee on the Hungarian Question" report? What do you think is the real purpose of this report?
    Answer: It is a case of "the thief crying 'stop thief!'" The purpose is to cover up imperialist subversion, oppose the Soviet Union and communism, and deceive the people.
    Question: In your opinion, is this a conspiracy by imperialism to rudely interfere in Hungary's internal affairs? Are they trying to use the United Nations to achieve their own goals, namely to divert world public opinion from their bloody crimes in Oman, Algeria, and Cyprus?
    Answer: Absolutely. At the same time, it is also covering up the imperialist aggression conspiracy, putting sheep's clothing on wolves.
    Question: Do such actions by the imperialist bloc conform to the interests of peace and achieve the goal of easing international tensions?
    Answer: Such actions completely violate the interests of peace. The imperialist bloc, especially a handful of American warmongers, wants to intensify international tensions in order to gain bloody profits. This is not allowed!
    Question: The Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations firmly opposes the convening of a special session. What does public opinion in the People's Republic of China think of this conspiracy by the imperialist bloc directed by American imperialism?
    Answer: The Soviet Union's consistent peace policy has increasingly gained the recognition and support of people around the world. The Soviet representative's firm opposition to the convening of the UN General Assembly special session is a just action, and the Chinese people fully support it. The Chinese people's loud response to this conspiracy is: "American imperialists, get out of Taiwan quickly!"

    郭沫若答苏联共青团真理报记者问
    中国人民反对联合国干涉匈内政
    联大讨论“匈牙利问题”是美国制造紧张局势的阴谋
    本报讯　苏联共青团真理报驻中国记者瓦·卡西斯就联合国大会召开特别大会讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”一事，向中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若提出几个问题。郭沫若对这些问题作了答复。下面是记者的问题和郭沫若的答复。
    问：您对联合国大会召开特别会议讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”一事有何看法？
    答：这是干涉匈牙利内政。联合国在美国操纵下又犯了一次非法的罪行。
    问：您对“匈牙利问题特别委员会”的报告的内容有何看法？您认为这报告的真正目的是什么？
    答：是“贼喊捉贼”。目的在掩护帝国主义的颠覆活动，反苏反共，欺骗人民。
    问：据您的意见，这是不是帝国主义粗暴干涉匈牙利内政的一种阴谋？是不是它们企图利用联合国来达到自己的目的，即分散世界舆论对它们在阿曼、阿尔及利亚及塞浦路斯所进行的血腥罪行的注意力？
    答：完全是。同时也在掩盖帝国主义的侵略阴谋，把羊皮披在狼身上。
    问：帝国主义集团这样的行动是否符合和平的利益及达到缓和国际紧张局势的目的？
  答：这样的行动完全违背和平的利益。帝国主义集团，特别是一小撮的美国好战分子，是想加紧国际紧张局势，以图血腥利润。这是不能允许的！
    问：苏联驻联合国的代表坚决反对召开特别会议。中华人民共和国的社会舆论对美帝国主义指使的这一帝国主义集团的阴谋如何看法？
    答：苏联一贯坚持的和平政策已愈来愈得到世界各国人民的认识和支持。苏联代表坚决反对联大特别会议的召开是正义的行动，中国人民完全支持。中国人民对这一阴谋的响亮的回答是：“美帝国主义者迅速从台湾滚回去！”
