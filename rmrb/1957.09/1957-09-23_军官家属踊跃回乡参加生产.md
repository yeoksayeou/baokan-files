Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: Recently, many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have launched profound socialist education among the family members accompanying military officers, mobilizing them to establish the idea that labor is glorious and to return to their hometowns to participate in labor production.

This education has achieved remarkable results. Many dependents of military officers have signed up to return to their hometowns, determined to contribute their strength to the agricultural production front. By the beginning of September, one unit had already had eighty-five households of military officers' dependents return to their hometowns, and another one hundred and eighty households had also signed up and were preparing to return. Recently, three hundred and fifteen dependents of military officers from a certain unit have signed up to return to their hometowns to engage in production. More than twenty dependents of military officers from a certain unit of the Wuhan garrison also took up agricultural production positions not long ago, and many women from working people's backgrounds took the lead in responding to the call and took up agricultural production positions.

While mobilizing the dependents of military officers to return to their hometowns for production, many units have taken many concrete measures to help them participate in production labor. Some units are building military camp farms; some units have already organized a group of military officers' dependents who have no homes to participate in the production labor of the local agricultural production cooperatives.

    军官家属踊跃回乡参加生产
    新华社22日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队最近在随军家属中展开了深刻的社会主义教育，动员她们树立劳动光荣的思想，回乡参加劳动生产。
    这一教育已经收到了显著成效。许多军官家属纷纷报名回乡，决心到农业生产战线上去贡献自己的力量。某部到9月初为止，已经有八十五户军官家属返乡，另有一百八十户也已报名准备返乡。某部最近报名回乡生产的军官家属已达三百十五人。武汉驻军某部二十多位军官家属也在不久前走上农业生产岗位，许多劳动人民出身的妇女都带头响应号召，走上了农业生产岗位。
    许多部队在动员军官家属回乡生产的同时，采取了帮助她们投入生产劳动的许多具体措施。有些部队正在筹建军营农场；有些部队已经组织一批无家可归的军官家属，参加驻地农业生产合作社的生产劳动。
