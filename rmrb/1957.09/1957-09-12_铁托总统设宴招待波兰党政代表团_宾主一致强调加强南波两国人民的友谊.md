Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, September 11th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, Gomulka, Cyrankiewicz, and other members of the Polish Party and Government delegation paid a visit to Yugoslav President Tito on the 10th at noon and held a half-hour conversation.

President Tito hosted a luncheon in the Federal Executive Council Building for the Polish Party and Government delegation.

At the luncheon, Tito first spoke of the friendship between the people of Yugoslavia and Poland, pointing out that the liberation struggles waged by the people of both countries during World War II, as well as the sacrifices they endured, have provided a reliable guarantee for their lasting friendship. Tito said that the people of Yugoslavia, their country, and the leadership of the Party welcome with boundless admiration the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party last year.

Speaking on international issues, Tito pointed out that the prospects for peaceful active coexistence and cooperation are developing. The people of Yugoslavia and Poland are extremely concerned about maintaining European security and world peace, and are paying attention to the issue of disarmament. He believes that the German question is one of the most important issues concerning peace and security. Tito said that from the perspective of the rights of the Polish people, and from the interests of European security and peace, we believe that the Oder-Neisse border is the only lasting solution between Poland and Germany.

Tito said that for the international workers' movement and for socialism as a whole, relations between socialist countries and between socialist governments are of particular importance. He said that our two countries are advancing along paths inevitably generated by our own specific historical and other conditions in building socialism.

Finally, Tito expressed his firm belief that this visit by the Polish leaders and the talks between the leaders of the two countries will help to further promote full mutual understanding, promote sincere cooperation and friendship, and will be beneficial to both countries, to the cause of socialism, and to the consolidation of peace.

In his reply, Gomulka said that the meeting between the leaders of the two countries not only proves that relations between the two countries have been normalized, but also proves the revival of the ancient friendship and solidarity between the two countries. He said that our Party, the working class, and the people of the entire country view the end of the period of division and misunderstanding with deep satisfaction.

Gomulka said that Poland understands and values Yugoslavia's achievements in the cause of socialist construction. The meeting between the leaders of Yugoslavia and Poland will be beneficial to consolidating the unity of the international workers' movement, and to maintaining harmony and cooperation among all socialist countries in accordance with the Leninist principles of equality and internationalism.

Gomulka believes that the most reliable guarantee for preventing the danger of war is the unity of socialist countries and the effective struggle of all peace-loving forces for disarmament, for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and for the formation of a collective security system. He said that in this regard, Poland is united with the Soviet Union, China, and countries that aspire to peace and protect the right of every nation to live independently.

　　铁托总统设宴招待波兰党政代表团
　　宾主一致强调加强南波两国人民的友谊
    据新华社贝尔格莱德11日电  据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：哥穆尔卡、西伦凯维兹和波兰党和政府代表团的其他人员，10日中午拜会了南斯拉夫总统铁托，并且进行了半小时的谈话。
    铁托在联邦执行委员会大厦设午宴招待了波兰党和政府代表团。
    铁托在午宴上首先谈到了南波两国人民的友谊，他指出，第二次世界大战期间两国人民所进行的解放斗争以及他们所遭到的牺牲，已经为他们的持久友谊提供了可靠的保证。铁托说，南斯拉夫人民，他们的国家和党的领导以无限钦佩之情欢迎波兰统一工人党去年八中全会的决议。
    在谈到国际问题的时候，铁托指出，和平的积极共处和合作的前景正在发展。南波两国人民极为关心维护欧洲安全和世界和平，并且注意裁军问题。他认为德国问题是有关和平和安全的最重要的问题之一。铁托说，从波兰人民的权利、从欧洲的安全和和平利益出发，我们认为波兰和德国之间的奥得—尼斯分界线是唯一持久的解决办法。
    铁托说，为了国际工人运动和整个社会主义，社会主义国家之间和社会主义政府之间的关系具有特别重要的意义。他说，我们两国在建设社会主义的时候沿着自己具体的历史条件和其他条件所必然产生的道路前进。
    最后，铁托表示坚信，波兰领袖的这次访问和两国领导人的会谈，将有助于进一步促进充分的相互了解，促进真诚的合作和友谊，并且将有利于两国、有利于社会主义事业和巩固和平。
    哥穆尔卡致答词说，两国领袖们的会见不仅证明两国关系已经正常化，而且证明两国古老的友谊和团结的新生。他说，我们的党、工人阶级和全国人民怀着深深欣慰的心情看待分歧和误会时期的终结。
    哥穆尔卡说，波兰了解并且重视南斯拉夫在社会主义建设事业中的成就。南波两国领袖们的会晤对于巩固国际工人运动的团结、对于一切社会主义国家按照列宁的平等和国际主义原则保持和睦和合作将是有益的。
    哥穆尔卡认为，防止战争危险的最可靠的保证就是社会主义国家的团结以及一切和平力量争取裁军、禁止大规模毁灭性武器以及争取组成集体安全体系的有效斗争。他说，在这方面，波兰同苏联、中国和渴望和平以及保护每一个民族过独立生活的权利的国家，是团结一致的。
