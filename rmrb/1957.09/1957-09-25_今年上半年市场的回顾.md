A Review of the Market in the First Half of the Year
Trade Planning Department of the National Bureau of Statistics

The market in the first half of the year was characterized by: rising social commodity retail sales; an initial improvement in the supply of non-staple foods; an increase in industrial product inventories; a decrease in market currency circulation; and basically stable prices.

In 1956, because the growth rate of social purchasing power exceeded the growth rate of consumer goods production, a tense situation once emerged in the domestic market in the second half of 1956. To alleviate this situation, the state launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the country at the beginning of 1957, and adopted measures such as balancing fiscal and credit revenues and expenditures, reducing investment in capital construction, compressing the purchasing power of government agencies and organizations, and appropriately ensuring the supply of goods to residents. In the past six months, these measures have achieved significant results, and the overall market situation has shifted from tension to relaxation. The characteristics of the market in the first half of this year were: rising social commodity retail sales; declining purchasing power of government agencies and organizations; an initial improvement in the supply of non-staple foods; an increase in industrial product inventories; a decrease in market currency circulation; and a trend toward stable prices.

According to preliminary calculations, the total retail sales of social commodities in the first half of 1957 increased by 7% compared with the same period last year. Separating urban and rural areas, cities increased more, and rural areas declined slightly. The retail sales in cities increased by 17.3% in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. This was mainly because wages began to be adjusted in the second half of last year, so the wage income of employees in the first half of this year increased compared with the first half of last year, thereby increasing purchasing power. Retail sales in rural areas decreased by 1.4% in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. This was because although farmers' income from selling agricultural and sideline products increased, the agricultural loans and advance purchase deposits of agricultural products issued by the state decreased compared with the same period last year, thus affecting the slight reduction in farmers' purchasing power.

The total purchase amount of commodities by state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises in the first half of 1957 increased quarter by quarter. Among them, the total purchase amount of industrial products increased by 18.8% compared with the same period last year, and the total purchase amount of agricultural and sideline products increased by 8.9%. The increase in the amount of commodities controlled by the state has increased the material strength to stabilize the market. However, the procurement volume of some agricultural and sideline products decreased compared with the same period last year. Calculated on a production year basis, the requisition and purchase volume of grain and cotton decreased compared with the previous production year. Due to the disasters in some areas last year, the requisition and purchase volume of grain in this production year (July 1956 to June 1957) decreased by 3% compared with the previous production year. From the perspective of varieties, the requisition and purchase volume of rice and miscellaneous grains mainly decreased, while wheat increased; From a regional perspective, the requisition and purchase volume decreased in 15 provinces compared with the previous year, among which Hebei, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangxi decreased more. Most of these areas were severely affected by disasters last year. It is estimated that the requisition and purchase volume of cotton according to the production year (September 1956 to August 1957) will also decrease compared with the previous year, mainly because the cotton producing areas in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces, which account for more than 80% of the country's cotton output, suffered natural disasters of varying degrees in 1956.

The sales volume of state-owned commercial enterprises in the first half of 1957 also increased quarter by quarter, increasing by 6% compared with the same period last year. Because the increase in sales is slower than the increase in purchases, the commodity inventory is trending toward reasonable growth. In the first half of this year, the state used more of the previously accumulated inventory to ensure the supply of grain to residents. Therefore, the total inventory of all state-owned commercial enterprises at the end of June this year decreased slightly compared with the end of June and December last year. However, if the grain figures are not included, the total inventory of state-owned commercial enterprises at the end of June this year was only 250 million yuan less than the end of June last year, and 860 million yuan more than the end of December last year. On the other hand, the total inventory of supply and marketing cooperatives at the end of June this year also increased compared with the end of June and December last year. Therefore, the inventory situation of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises (excluding grain) has completely changed the downward trend month by month in the second half of last year and gradually increased, thereby increasing the guarantee for stabilizing the market and supplying goods to residents.

The overall trend of commodity supply and social purchasing power in the first half of this year is balanced. Separating commodities, the following different situations are presented.

1.  In terms of grain, the grain sold in the domestic market in the first half of the year increased by 7.5% compared with the same period last year, with an increase of 8.6% in cities and 6.5% in rural areas. Part of the increase in grain sales is due to the increase in population and increased sales to disaster areas, which is reasonable; however, part of it is due to the lax control over grain supply, which is unreasonable. Due to the increase in grain sales in the first half of the year, more inventory grain was used, so it is necessary to strictly control grain sales in the second half of the year.

2.  In terms of non-staple foods, the tense supply situation that appeared last year has begun to improve in the first half of this year. Among them, for some major non-staple foods, such as pork, due to the increase in the number of live pigs raised by farmers, the increase in the amount purchased by the state, and the reduction in export tasks, the domestic sales volume in the first half of this year increased by 37% compared with the same period last year, and the inventory volume also increased compared with the past; the supply of eggs has been abundant since the second quarter; the supply of vegetables in cities has been relatively sufficient in the first half of this year; and the supply of aquatic products has also improved. However, the supply of sugar has always been tight. The sales volume of sugar in the first half of this year increased by 23.3% compared with the same period last year, but the purchase volume was less than the same period last year, so the sugar inventory decreased.

3.  In terms of industrial products, the market supply situation is unbalanced, and can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category of commodities continues to be in short supply, the most prominent of which are cotton cloth and coal. Due to the decrease in cotton purchase and the decrease in cotton cloth production this year, the pressure on cotton cloth supply has increased. The number of cotton cloths sold in the domestic market in the first half of this year increased by 1% compared with the same period last year. Although the cotton cloth inventory of state-owned commercial enterprises at the end of June increased compared with the end of last year, it was still reduced by 15% compared with the inventory before the peak sales season at the end of June last year. Due to the tight supply of cotton cloth, some cotton knitwear has also appeared to be in short supply. The sales volume of coal in the first half of this year increased by 9.2% compared with the same period last year, and the inventory at the end of June decreased compared with the same period last year. The supply in the second half of the year will be tighter. The second category of commodities is basically balanced in supply and demand, or the degree of tension has been alleviated. Among them, some raw materials required for industry and handicrafts, their supply in the first half of the year decreased compared with the same period last year, while the inventory at the end of June increased compared with the same period last year, such as the sales volume of pig iron was 59.7% of the same period last year, and the inventory increased by 26% compared with the end of June last year; the sales volume of galvanized iron wire was 76.6% of the same period last year, and the inventory increased by 75.6% compared with the end of June last year. The formation of this situation is due to the extensive and in-depth development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, as well as the fact that some production enterprises have cleaned up their internal inventories and carried out mutual adjustment, thereby reducing purchases from the market. In addition, some daily necessities such as rubber shoes and flashlights are also balanced in supply and demand. The third category of commodities is in abundant supply, including most cultural supplies, some daily necessities, and some hardware, electrical, and chemical commodities. For example, the inventory of cultural supplies company system at the end of June this year increased by 21.8% compared with the end of June last year, and the inventory of department store company system at the end of June also increased by 10.8% compared with the end of December last year.

4.  In terms of agricultural production materials, the agricultural production materials supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives in the first half of this year decreased by 18.6% compared with the same period last year. This is mainly because the agricultural production cooperatives implemented the policy of diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives this year, corrected the shortcomings of greed and excess in purchasing production materials last year, as well as the impact of disasters in some areas.

In the first half of this year, in order to further promote production development and maintain the balance of material supply and fiscal revenue and expenditure, the state successively increased the purchase prices of live pigs, oilseeds, and miscellaneous grains, and the sales prices of commodities such as salt, edible oil, pork, woolen fabrics, high-grade cigarettes, and tea; on the other hand, after the opening of the free market under the leadership of the state, the prices of non-staple foods such as vegetables and fresh fish, some handicrafts, and small local specialties in the free market also rose. Therefore, the prices in the first half of this year rose slightly. The overall level of the retail price index in 29 cities in the first half of this year increased by 3.2% compared with the first half of last year. However, the price increase in the first half of the year mainly occurred before April. After April, all parts of the country strengthened price management work. Since May, prices have turned from rising to basically stable. For example, the retail price index in 29 cities, taking December last year as 100, was 101.0 in January this year, 101.3 in February, 102.1 in March, 103.8 in April, 103.9 in May, and 103.6 in June. On the other hand, although prices rose in the first half of this year, the main increases were in some non-staple foods (especially seasonal vegetables), high-end consumer goods, and some handicraft products, while the prices of major commodities necessary for people's lives, such as grain, cotton cloth, and coal, remained stable. According to the classified retail price index of 29 cities in the first half of this year, the percentages compared with the same period last year were 100.3 for grain, 100.2 for clothing, and 100.8 for fuel. From this comparison, it can be seen that although the price fluctuations in the first half of this year have had some impact on the lives of ordinary people, this impact is actually not too great because the prices of commodities such as grain, clothing, and fuel, which account for a large proportion of residents' consumption, are basically stable.

    今年上半年市场的回顾
    国家统计局贸易计划司
    上半年的市场特点是：社会商品零售额上升；副食品供应开始好转；工业品库存增加；市场货币流通量减少；物价基本稳定。
    1956年由于社会购买力增长的速度超过了消费资料生产的增长速度，因而在1956年下半年的国内市场上，曾经一度出现了紧张现象。为了缓和这种局面，国家从1957年初起在全国范围内展开了增产节约运动，并采取平衡财政与信贷收支、削减基本建设投资、压缩机关团体购买力、适当保证对居民的商品供应等措施，半年以来，这些措施已经收到了显著的效果，市场总的情况已由紧张转向缓和。今年上半年市场的特点是：社会商品零售额上升；机关团体购买力下降；副食品供应开始好转；工业品库存增加；市场货币流通量减少；物价转趋稳定。
    1957年上半年社会商品零售总额，根据初步计算，与去年同期比较，增长7％。分别城乡来看，则城市增长较多，农村略有下降。今年上半年城市零售额较去年同期增加17.3％，主要是由于去年下半年工资开始调整，因此今年上半年职工工资收入较去年上半年增多，从而使购买力加大。农村上半年零售额较去年同期下降1.4％，这是因为农民出售农副产品的收入虽有所增长，但国家发放的农业贷款及农产品预购定金则较去年同期减少，因而影响农民购买力略有缩减。
    1957年上半年国营及合作社商业商品收购总额是逐季增长的，其中工业品收购总额较去年同期增加18.8％，农副产品收购总额则增加8.9％，由于国家掌握的商品数额增多，从而增加了稳定市场的物质力量。但是在农副产品中，有若干商品的采购量则较去年同期减少，以生产年度计算，粮食及棉花的征购数量均较上一生产年度减少。粮食由于去年部分地区遭受灾荒，本生产年度（1956年7月至1957年6月）的征购数量较上一生产年度减少3％，从品种上来看，主要是稻谷与杂粮征购量减少，小麦则有增加；从地区上来看，征购量较上年减少的有十五个省，其中河北、吉林、黑龙江、江苏、安徽、浙江、湖南、广西等八省减少较多，这些地区大都是去年受灾较重的地区。棉花按生产年度（1956年9月至1957年8月）征购量预计也较上一年度减少，主要是由于占全国棉花产量80％以上的河北、山东、河南、山西、陕西、湖北、江苏七省的棉产区，在1956年内都遭受了轻重不同的自然灾害。
    1957年上半年国营商业的销售额也是逐季增长的，与去年同期比较，增长6％。由于销售增长的幅度较慢于购进增长的幅度，因此商品库存量正趋于合理的增长，今年上半年国家为了保证对居民的粮食供应，动用以前积蓄的库存量较大，因此今年6月底全部国营商业的库存总额较去年6月底及12月底都略有减少，但如果将粮食的数字不包括在内计算，则今年6月末国营商业的库存总额较去年6月末仅少2.5亿元，而较去年12月底则增加8.6亿元。另一方面，供销合作社今年6月末的库存总额较去年6月底及12月底也有增加。因此国营及合作社商业的库存情况（不包括粮食）已完全改变去年下半年逐月下降的趋势，而逐渐增加，从而增加了稳定市场及对居民供应商品的保证力量。
    今年上半年商品供应与社会购买力总的趋向是平衡的，分别商品来看，则呈现下列不同情况。
    一、在粮食方面，上半年国内市场销售的粮食较去年同期增加7.5％，其中城市增加8.6％，农村增加6.5％。粮食销售量的增加，有一部分是由于人口增加及供应灾区而多销的，这是合理的；但也有一部分是由于对粮食供应控制不严而多销的，这是不合理的。由于上半年粮食销售增加，动用了较多的库存粮食，因此在下半年必须严格的控制粮食销售量。
    二、在副食品方面，去年出现的供应紧张情况，今年上半年已经开始好转。其中一些主要副食品，如猪肉由于农民饲养的活猪增加，国家收购量增多，以及出口任务的减少，今年上半年国内销售量较去年同期增加37％，库存量也较过去增大；鸡蛋的供应量自第二季度起已见充裕；城市蔬菜供应今年上半年较为充足；水产品的供应情况也有起色。但食糖的供应情况，一直还是紧张的。今年上半年食糖销售量较去年同期增加23.3％，但购进量则不及去年同期，因而食糖库存量就有所减少。
    三、在工业品方面，市场供应情况是不平衡的，大体上可分为三类。第一类商品是继续紧张的，突出的是棉布与煤炭。由于棉花收购量减少，今年棉布减产，因此加大了对棉布供应的压力，上半年国内市场销售的棉布数量较去年同期增加1％，6月末国营商业的棉布库存虽较去年年底增加，但与去年6月底旺销季节以前的库存量相比，则仍减少15％。由于棉布供应的紧张，一部分针棉织品也出现了供应紧张现象。煤炭今年上半年的销售量较去年同期增加9.2％，6月底库存则较去年同期减少，下半年供应将是较紧张的。第二类商品是供求基本平衡的，或是紧张程度已经缓和的。其中如工业、手工业所需用的一些原材料，其上半年供应量较去年同期下降，而6月底的库存则较去年同期增加，如生铁销售量为去年同期的59.7％，库存则较去年6月底增加26％；镀锌铁丝销售量为去年同期的76.6％，库存则较去年6月底增加75.6％。这种情况的形成，乃是由于增产节约运动广泛深入的开展，以及若干生产企业清理了内部库存，并进行相互调剂，从而减少了对市场的采购之故。此外，一部分日用百货如胶鞋、手电筒等，也是供求平衡的。第三类商品是供应充裕的，包括大部分文化用品，一部分日用百货以及一部分五金、交电、化工商品，例如文化用品公司系统今年6月底的库存商品较去年6月底增加21.8％，百货公司系统6月底库存商品也较去年12月底增加10.8％。
    四、在农业生产资料方面，今年上半年供销合作社供应的农业生产资料较去年同期减少18.6％，这主要是由于今年农业生产合作社贯彻勤俭办社的方针，纠正了去年购买生产资料贪多贪大的缺点，以及部分地区遭受灾害的影响。
    今年上半年，国家为了进一步促进生产发展，保持物资供应和财政收支的平衡，曾先后提高了生猪、油料、小杂粮的收购价格，和食盐、食油、猪肉、呢绒、高级纸烟、茶叶等商品的销售价格；另一方面，国家领导下的自由市场开放以后，自由市场的蔬菜、鲜鱼等副食品、若干手工业品和小土特产品的价格也有上升，因而今年上半年的物价略有上升，二十九个城市的零售物价指数今年上半年总水平较去年上半年上升3.2％。但是上半年物价的上升主要是出现在4月份以前，4月份后全国各地加强了物价管理工作，自5月份起，物价即由上升转为基本稳定。例如二十九个城市零售物价指数，如以去年12月为一百，则今年1月为101.0，2月为101.3，3月为102.1，4月为103.8，5月为103.9，6月为103.6。另一方面，今年上半年物价虽有上升，但上升较多的主要是一些副食品（特别是季节性蔬菜），高级消费品及一部分手工业产品，而人民生活必需的主要商品，如粮食、棉布及煤炭等价格则一直保持稳定。根据二十九个城市今年上半年零售物价分类指数，与去年同期比较的百分比，粮食类为100.3，衣着类为100.2，燃料类为100.8，由比可见，今年上半年物价的波动，虽然对一般人民的生活有一些影响，但由于占居民消费构成比重较大的粮食、衣着及燃料等类商品的价格基本稳定，因此这种影响实际并不是太大的。
