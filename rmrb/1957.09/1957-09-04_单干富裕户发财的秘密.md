Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Electric Telegram: "Are the eighteen individual rich peasants really better than the agricultural cooperatives?" The peasants of Lulin Village, Hantang Township, Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, recently launched a debate on this issue.

When Lulin Village established cooperatives last year, the Lulin and Hefeng cooperatives were formed with poor peasants as the core. At that time, some peasants believed that individual farming was better than agricultural cooperatives, and not only did they not join the cooperatives, but they also wanted to compete with the agricultural cooperatives. Under their influence, a total of ninety-nine peasant households in the village insisted on individual farming.

After the establishment of the two cooperatives, the average per capita grain ration last year was over 500 catties, and the remuneration for each labor day was between 1.20 and 1.40 yuan. More than 80% of the members increased their income. This year, the production of these two cooperatives has developed further, and the income of the members has increased again.

However, the eighteen individual rich peasant households in the village insisted that agricultural cooperatives were not as good as individual farming. Through debate, the secrets of these eighteen households were revealed.

First, they relied on exploiting hired labor. These eighteen rich peasant households generally hired long-term and short-term laborers. Zhang Abao's family had nineteen mu of land and hired one long-term laborer and more than thirty short-term laborers. Last year, their agricultural income was 1,336 yuan, while the wage expenditure for hired labor was only 153 yuan, with exploitation reaching 400-500 yuan.

Second, they engaged in commerce. Yu Shanxiang left the land to be cultivated by hired laborers and engaged in business himself, earning more than 480 yuan last year.

Third, they violated the state's grain policy by delaying grain purchase quotas and engaging in speculative activities. Zhou Achong owed 1,300 catties of public grain last year, while he made more than 300 catties of rice cakes at home. Hu Meiwang owed 500 catties of public grain at the end of last year, but sold more than 400 catties of grain on the black market at a high price this year.

Fourth, they did not comply with the state's planting requirements. Chang Hongfan said: "My production policy is not to plant what the state calls for, not to plant what cannot be sold at a high price, and not to plant what the cooperatives plant; but to plant what the cooperatives do not plant."

Then, the two agricultural cooperatives made a comparison with the ninety-nine individual peasant households in the village. According to investigation and statistics, among these ninety-nine households, only twenty-odd households lived as well as the cooperative members; more than fifty households did not live as well as the cooperative members. The so-called only those eighteen households who took the capitalist road for illegal profits were truly better off than the cooperative members.

As the debate was about to end, many members came to the stage to express: they resolutely would not take the capitalist road that made a few people rich and the majority poor, but must follow the Communist Party, take the road of agricultural cooperation, and take the road of socialism. Twelve members of the third production team of the Hefeng Agricultural Cooperative, who had originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, immediately withdrew their requests to withdraw. Some individual farmers outside the cooperative also came to the cooperative to make contact, requesting to join the cooperative after the autumn harvest.

    单干富裕户发财的秘密
    据新华社杭州电 “十八户单干富裕农民真比农业社强吗？”浙江省镇海县汉塘乡鹭林村的农民，最近就这个问题展开了辩论。
    鹭林村去年办社时，以贫苦农民为核心组成了鹭林、和丰两个社。当时，有些农民认为农业社不如单干，不仅不入社，而且要同农业社较量高低。在他们的影响下，全村共有九十九户农民坚持单干。
    两个社成立后，去年平均每人口粮分到五百斤以上，每个劳动日的报酬是一元二角到一元四角，80％以上的社员增加了收入。今年，这两个社生产又发展了，社员收入又增加了。
    但是村里十八户单干富裕农民，却硬说农业社不如单干好。通过辩论，才揭开这十八户的底细。
    第一是靠剥削雇工。这十八户富裕农民普遍雇了长工和短工。张阿宝家有十九亩田，雇长工一个，短工三十多工，去年一年农业收入是一千三百三十六元，而雇工的工资支出只有一百五十三元，剥削达四五百元。
    第二是经营商业。余善祥把家里田交雇工种，自己经商，去年就赚了四百八十多元。
    第三是违反国家粮食政策，拖欠粮食征购任务进行投机活动。周阿冲去年拖欠一千三百斤公粮，而他在家里却做了三百多斤的年糕。胡梅王去年尾欠公粮五百斤，今年却在黑市高价卖掉粮食四百多斤。
    第四是不遵守国家的种植要求。常洪畈说：“我的生产方针是国家号召的不种，卖不到高价的不种，合作社种的不种；而合作社不种的偏要种。”
    接着，这两个农业社又同全村的九十九户单干农民作了对比，据调查统计，这九十九户中，只有二十多户和社员生活相等；五十多户不如社员生活好。所谓真正比社员好的只有那走资本主义道路非法牟利的十八户。
    辩论会快结束时，许多社员纷纷上台表示：坚决不走使少数人发财、多数人贫穷的资本主义道路，一定要跟着共产党，走农业合作化道路，走社会主义的道路。和丰农业社第三生产小队原来要退社的十二户社员，当场撤销了退社要求。社外的一些单干农民，也纷纷到社里接头，要求秋后入社。
