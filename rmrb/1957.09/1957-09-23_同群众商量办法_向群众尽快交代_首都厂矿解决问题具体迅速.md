Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: In implementing the spirit of rectification while correcting, the CCP organizations of forty state-owned factories and mines in the capital, having swiftly resolved the first batch of over 15,000 problems, recently witnessed twenty-four units holding their second worker representative congress since the start of the rectification campaign. The Party Committees of each unit announced solutions to the second batch of problems. According to statistics from units such as the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, Beijing Telegraph Bureau, and Beijing Public Transportation Company, the number of problems to be addressed immediately in the second batch, combined with those already solved in the first batch, already accounts for 60% of the total number of opinions from the masses that can be resolved immediately or in the near future.

According to the heads of many units, they are confident that before National Day this year, all problems can be basically resolved except those requiring mass debate, transfer to relevant departments, or requests for instructions from higher authorities.

Currently, leaders at all levels of Party organizations in many units have left their offices and are working with the masses in workshops and teams to discuss solutions to problems together. In factories and mines, big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and wired broadcasts are used daily to announce news of problem-solving to the workers. At the Shijingshan Power Plant, big-character posters detailing the solutions to problems in various departments, as well as self-criticisms from Party member cadres regarding their shortcomings, are continuously posted alongside the original big-character posters. The workers read these big-character posters very carefully, and some even put up big-character posters praising the concrete and rapid solutions. A big-character poster entitled "Accept Criticism, Improve Work, First Batch of Cadres to Return to Production Soon" was widely welcomed by the workers. This big-character poster reported that the factory had decided to send six workshop director-level cadres down to serve as team leaders and workers, and five team leader-level cadres down to work as repairmen, foundry workers, milling machine operators, and drivers, to strengthen the grassroots level.

Before announcing the solutions to the second batch of problems, the CCP organizations in each unit dispatched a large number of cadres to comprehensively categorize and sort the opinions raised by the masses. To promptly explain the situation to the masses, they worked until late at night, the sound of typewriters running non-stop throughout the night. Units such as the State-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill and Beijing No. 1 Automobile Parts Factory printed cards when sorting through the opinions of the masses, meticulously recording tens of thousands of opinions to truly ensure that the opinions of the masses are "explained item by item, every matter is addressed, and not a single one is missed." To ensure that the second batch of problems is resolved quickly and thoroughly, the Party Committee of the Beijing Public Transportation Company also established a problem-solving inspection team to go to various units within the company to supervise and inspect.

Based on the experience of various factories and mines in solving the first batch of problems, it is necessary to follow the mass line and mobilize everyone to solve problems together. In handling the first batch of problems, some units did not pay attention to mobilizing the masses, resulting in a situation where the higher-ups were busy while the lower-downs were idle, and the leading cadres were overwhelmed, yet the problems were not resolved well. This situation has now been basically reversed, and attention is generally paid to the working methods of the mass line. The Beijing No. 1 Automobile Parts Factory's approach is: problems concerning the entire factory are solved by various specialized groups established by the factory's rectification office in conjunction with relevant units; problems belonging to various workshops and departments are entrusted to the leadership of the workshops and departments to mobilize the masses to solve them in a planned and organized manner. As a result, the factory solved more than 400 problems in just two days.

While vigorously solving problems, many unit workers have realized that some problems must be resolved through everyone's debate, increased understanding, and clarification of right and wrong. Currently, some unit workers have launched debates on whether the wages of young workers are high or low, and whether the current living benefits are sufficient or not. Based on this situation, in addition to devoting great energy to urging various departments to quickly improve their work, the CCP organizations of various factories and mines have also set aside some people to form specialized groups to study how to organize and lead the masses of workers to launch debates on some of the major issues they raised during the period of extensive airing of views and opinions.

### 同群众商量办法　向群众尽快交代  首都厂矿解决问题具体迅速

    同群众商量办法　向群众尽快交代
    首都厂矿解决问题具体迅速
    新华社22日讯　首都四十个国营厂矿企业的中共组织贯彻边整边改精神，迅速解决了第一批一万五千多个问题以后，最近又有二十四个单位召开整风以来的第二次职工代表大会，由各单位的党委会宣布了第二批问题的解决方案。据国营北京第二棉纺织厂、北京电报局、北京市公共汽车公司等单位的统计，第二批要立即着手解决的问题加上第一批已经解决的问题，已经占群众意见总数中可以马上解决或可能在最近时期内解决的数字的60％。
    据很多单位的负责人谈，他们有充分的信心在今年国庆节以前，除必须经过群众辩论和转交有关部门或请示上级机关解决的问题以外，其他问题可以基本上解决完毕。
    现在，很多单位党组织的各级领导人，都离开了办公室，在各车间各小组同群众共同商量解决问题的办法。工矿企业内的大字报、黑板报、有线广播，每天向职工公布解决问题的消息。在石景山发电厂，各部门解决问题的大字报和党员干部对自己缺点的检查报告，不断加贴在原有的大字报上。职工们在这些大字报前，非常认真地阅读，有的职工还贴出大字报称赞他们解决问题具体迅速。有一张题目为“接受批评，改进工作，第一批干部即将回到生产上去”的大字报贴出以后，受到职工群众的普遍欢迎。这张大字报报道：工厂已经决定将六名车间主任级的干部下放作班长和工人，将五个班长级的干部下放作检修、翻砂、铣床工和司机，以充实基层。
    在宣布第二批问题的解决方案以前，各单位的中共组织都抽调大批干部，对群众提出的意见进行了全面的分类排队。为了尽快地向群众作出交代，他们每天工作到深夜，打字机的声音彻夜不停。国营北京第三棉纺织厂、北京第一汽车附件厂等单位，在对群众的意见进行排队时，印制了卡片，把数万条意见进行了详细的登记，以便真正做到群众的意见“条条有交代，件件有着落，不遗漏一条”。为了使第二批问题得到迅速彻底的解决，北京市公共汽车公司党委还成立了解决问题检查组，分赴本公司各单位督促检查。
    根据各厂矿企业解决第一批问题的经验，在解决群众提出的问题时，必须走群众路线，发动大家一起解决问题。在处理第一批问题时，有些单位因为没有注意发动群众发生了上忙下闲的现象，领导干部忙得不可开交，问题还是解决不好。这种状况目前已经基本上扭转过来，普遍注意了群众路线的工作方法。北京第一汽车附件厂的做法是：有关全厂性的问题，由厂整风办公室成立的各种专门小组会同有关单位解决，属于各车间、科室的问题分别交由车间、科室的领导方面有计划有领导地发动群众解决。这样做的结果，在短短的两天内全厂就解决了四百多个问题。
    在大力解决问题的同时，许多单位的职工已经认识到，有些问题必须经过大家的辩论，提高认识，分清是非以后才能解决。现在有些单位的职工已经对青年工人工资是高是低、生活福利目前是多是少等问题展开了辩论。根据这一情况，现在各厂矿企业的中共组织，除了用极大的精力督促各部门迅速改进工作以外，同时也抽出了一些人，组成专门小组，开始研究如何有组织地领导职工群众就他们在大鸣大放期间提出的一些重大问题展开辩论。
