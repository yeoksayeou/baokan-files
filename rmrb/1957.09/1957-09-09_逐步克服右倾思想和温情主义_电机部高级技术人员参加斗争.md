The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry is developing in depth as the masses’ awareness continues to improve. Most senior technicians, due to the practical education in the struggle, are also gradually overcoming Rightist ideology and warmongering, and have begun to actively participate in the exposure and criticism of Rightist elements. At the beginning of the rectification campaign in this ministry, Rightist elements were extremely rampant. Liu Feng, a Rightist element of the Electrical Appliances Science Research Institute, posted a big-character poster, making extremely vicious attacks on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign of the First Ministry of Machine Building. He demanded that "the highest leader responsible for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries must resign and apologize to the people of the country." Zou Jialong, a Rightist element of the Electrical Machinery Bureau, fundamentally negated the achievements of China's industrial construction. He also slandered our Party to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, saying: "Those who are morally corrupt are all Party members, and intellectuals are living under the eaves of others." Cao Runsheng, a Rightist element of the Electrical Appliances Bureau, has always hated the people. When the U.S. military landed in Incheon during the Korean War, Cao was overjoyed and danced in the toilet. This time, he attacked our Party and the socialist system, saying: "The public ownership system has no advantages, and free competition can inspire the enthusiasm for production." "You are engaged in sectarianism, and every citizen of the People's Republic of China has the right to overthrow you." Le Yongtai, a Rightist element of the Production Technology Department, was even more arrogant, plotting to undermine the worker-peasant alliance. For a few days, he was simply murderous, shouting to kill people, to kill Assistant Minister Zhu Yi, and to kill Section Chief Cao of the Cadre Department.

After two months of intense "laying out the facts and reasoning" critical struggle, these Rightist elements, in the face of the vivid facts listed by the masses, were refuted to the point of being speechless and at a loss for words, and had to lower their heads and confess their guilt. The masses of the Electrical Appliances Science Research Institute, in order to refute Liu Feng's fallacy of slandering the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign of the First Ministry of Machine Building, took the initiative to obtain the consent of the leadership and conducted an investigation at the First Ministry of Machine Building. At the criticism meeting, when the masses presented the case that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign of the First Ministry of Machine Building was not ruined, but was done very well, Liu Feng, who was nonchalant, suddenly changed his face and lowered his head. In order to criticize the Rightist element Zou Jialong, many engineering and technical personnel of the Electrical Machinery Bureau listed the specific figures of the construction of the electrical machinery industry to illustrate the great achievements of China's industrial construction. They also unanimously stated that they did not feel like they were living under the eaves of others, and pointed out that Zou, as the leader of the technology group, said that the Party did not value intellectuals, which was completely a fabrication and slander.

The Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry not only refuted the exposed Rightist elements to the point of lowering their heads and confessing their guilt, but also, with the deepening of the movement, exposed more hidden Rightist elements. For example, Song Hongjun, a Communist Party member and deputy section chief of the Production Technology Department, was exposed in the process of criticizing the Rightist element Le Yongtai. It turned out that Song Hongjun, due to serious individualism, had always been dissatisfied with the Party. During the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, Song instigated Le Yongtai to launch a frenzied attack on the Party; after the counterattack against the Rightists began, he also attempted to confuse the truth and assured the leadership that there were no Rightist elements in the department. However, in the process of criticizing Le Yongtai, because many of Le's reactionary remarks came from Song, Le's confessions were full of contradictions. Under the pursuit of the masses, Song's ugly face was finally exposed. A reactionary small group of the Electrical Appliances Science Research Institute, which posted big-character posters and reactionary slogans during the period of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, attempting to instigate the masses to make trouble, did not show up again after the anti-Rightist struggle began, and even pretended to be activists, attempting to divert the masses' attention. However, under the criticism and pursuit of the masses against those who had exposed reactionary remarks, the activities of the group also began to be exposed. After this period of struggle, the awareness of the general masses has also been universally improved. In units such as the Research Institute and the Capital Construction Bureau, some people who were misled by the Rightist elements in the past have automatically recognized their mistakes and actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle. Most of the senior technicians have also made strong criticisms of the Rightist elements. Cai Zhongyi, a technician of the Electrical Machinery Bureau, did not actively participate when he first fought back against the Rightists. Later, when he saw that the criticisms of the masses were all well-founded, he realized that he was lagging behind and actively participated in the battle.

    逐步克服右倾思想和温情主义
    电机部高级技术人员参加斗争
    本报讯　电机制造工业部的反右派斗争随着群众觉悟的不断提高，正在深入发展，大部分高级技术人员由于斗争中的实际教育，也在逐步克服着右倾思想和温情主义，开始积极地参加了对右派分子的揭发和批判。这个部在整风初期，右派分子十分猖狂。电器科学研究院右派分子刘峰贴了一张大字报，对一机部的肃反运动作了极其恶毒的攻击，他要求“负责肃反的最高领导人，必须引咎辞职，谢罪于国人”。电机局右派分子邹家隆则根本否定我国工业建设的成绩。他还以诬蔑我党，来挑拨党与知识分子的关系，说：“道德败坏的都是党员，知识分子是寄人篱下。”电器局右派分子曹润生，历来就对人民仇恨，美军侵朝在仁川登陆时，曹欣喜若狂，曾在厕所跳起舞来，此次又攻击我党与社会主义制度，说：“公有制度没有优越性，自由竞争才能启发生产的积极性。”“你们闹宗派，每个中华人民共和国的公民，都有权来打倒你们。”生产技术司右派分子乐永太，更为嚣张，阴谋破坏工农联盟，有几天他简直是杀气腾腾，喊着要杀人，要杀朱毅部长助理，要杀干部司曹处长。
    经过两个月来紧张的“摆事实、讲道理”的批判斗争，这些右派分子，在群众所列举的活生生的事实面前，被驳得张口结舌，理屈词穷，不得不低头认罪。电器科学研究院的群众，为驳斥刘峰诬蔑一机部肃反运动的谬论，曾主动征得领导上的同意，到一机部作了调查。在批判会上当群众摆出一机部的肃反运动，不是搞坏了，而是搞得很好的事例后，满不在乎的刘峰，亦倏然变色，低下头来。电机局的群众为批驳右派分子邹家隆，不少工程技术人员，曾列举了电机工业建设的具体数字，来说明我国工业建设的伟大成就。并一致表示，自己并无寄人篱下之感，并指出邹身为工艺组组长，反说党不重视知识分子，完全是造谣污蔑。
    电机制造工业部不但把已经暴露出来的右派分子驳得低头认罪，而且随着运动的深入，还揭露出更多的隐蔽着的右派分子。如生产技术司有一个共产党员副处长宋鸿钧，就是在批判右派分子乐永太的过程中被揭露出来的。原来宋鸿钧由于严重的个人主义，一贯对党不满，在大鸣大放时，宋即鼓动乐永太向党疯狂进攻；反击右派开始后还企图混淆真象，向领导上保证说该处没有右派分子。但在批判乐永太的过程中，由于乐的许多反动言论来源于宋，故乐的交代矛盾百出，在群众的追击之下，宋的丑恶面貌终于被暴露出来。电器科学研究院一个在大鸣大放时期大贴大字报和反动标语、企图煽动群众闹事的反动小集团，当反右派斗争开始后再不露头，甚至伪装积极分子，企图转移群众视线。但在群众对已暴露有反动言论的人的批判与追击下，该集团的活动，也开始暴露出来了。经过这一时期的斗争，一般群众的觉悟也普遍提高，研究院、基建局等单位，有些过去被右派分子迷惑的人，已自动认识了自己的错误，并积极参加了反右派的斗争，大部高级技术人员，也都向右派分子作了有力的批判。电机局技术员蔡中义，开始反击右派时，不积极参加，后看到群众的批判都有理有据，才发现自己落后了，就积极参加了战斗。
