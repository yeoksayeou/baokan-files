　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Many engineering and technical personnel in the central industrial and transportation departments, in the anti-rightist struggle, used a wealth of facts to illustrate that the engineering and technical personnel of New China have consistently received the trust and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

　　Many engineering and technical personnel who hold technical leadership positions in industrial and transportation departments cited specific examples of their different positions in the old and new China to refute the rightists' fallacies that engineering and technical personnel "have no position and no power" or "have position but no power." Xiao Xunhua, Deputy Chief of the Technical Division of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, said that he had been doing technical work in the organs of the Kuomintang reactionaries since 1935. During the ten years or so from being a draftsman to being an engineer, he deeply felt that technicians at that time were just machines, and there was no question of having a position or power at all. He said that after liberation, not long after he started working, the organization sent him to lead more than 1,000 employees to be responsible for the construction of a project. After he was transferred to the Technical Division of the Design Bureau in 1953, he often represented the bureau and the institute to directly inspect construction projects, decide on design principles, and handle technical accident prevention issues. In 1957, he was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Technical Division. The bureau chief instructed that he must be responsible for reviewing and signing technical documents of the bureau. He said, isn't this the best explanation of having a position and power? Xu Guangchen, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said that the bureau chief and deputy bureau chief jointly led the work of the Engineering Administration Bureau with him. He was personally responsible for the technical leadership work. The Technical Division and the Supply Division of the bureau were designated to be specifically led by him. The documents of these two divisions were issued by him. He was specifically responsible for and participated in a lot of work. He said that the rightists insisted that technical personnel "have position but no power" after liberation, which is completely a lie.

　　Many engineering and technical personnel also cited facts to refute the rightists' slanders that the Communist Party "favors its own people" and promotes cadres "party and league members first, then the masses." The technical personnel of the Non-ferrous Metal Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry pointed out that among the eleven directors of the research institute's research offices, there are only four communist party directors, and seven non-party technical personnel are directors. Among the seven large group leaders in the second metallurgy room of the research institute, there is also only one communist party member. The big-character posters posted by the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry cited facts to refute the rightists, saying that in 1956, 145 people in the bureau were promoted, including 40 communist party members, accounting for 27%, and 74 from the masses, accounting for 51%. In 1956, the bureau promoted 21 leading cadres above the section chief and engineer level, including only six communist party members. The vicious attacks of the rightists are completely unfounded. Zhang Yonghui, Chief Engineer of the Papermaking Research Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry, said that before liberation, I don't know how many people with special technologies had no way to exert their technical talents; and in factories or research institutes, they were also limited by equipment, funding, and reference materials, and they could not make technical progress. After liberation, the state entrusted him to be responsible for the construction of the state-owned Jiamusi Paper Mill, which is one of China's key construction projects. In 1956, he was transferred to the Papermaking Research Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry as Chief Engineer, and has been responsible for technical leadership work. He participates in important technical meetings held by the ministry. He refuted the rightists, saying that there has never been any "gully" or "wall" between him and the party member cadres. In any work, the party organization trusts and supports him. He said that now he does not feel that his talents cannot be used, but only feels that his abilities are limited and his political level is not high, and he cannot fully adapt to the needs of the work. Le Bo, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, said that under the trust and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, he had successively served as Deputy Director of the factory, Chief Engineer of the First Automobile Factory Engineering Company, and Deputy Chief Engineer of the Design Institute. In 1952, when he was the Deputy Director of the East China Timber Factory, he encountered many difficulties in his work. The Party tried various ways to help him politically and in his work, and used the Party's political influence to support him on various occasions. He pointed out that the rightists' attempt to provoke the relationship between the Party and non-Party engineering and technical personnel on the issue of powers is futile.

　　The engineering and technical personnel also pointed out that in the past few years, many rightists have been valued and trusted by the country, and many of them have also held important leadership positions. However, these people deliberately distorted the facts, confused right and wrong, and used the trust they had fraudulently obtained as a cover to engage in anti-communist and anti-socialist activities behind their backs. They pointed out that the rightists' fallacies of sowing discord between the Party and non-Party engineering and technical personnel and their conspiracy to abolish the Party's leadership over the engineering and technical circles cannot deceive any honest engineering and technical personnel.

　　右派分子听听正义的声音
　　党对工程技术人员一贯信任
　　中央工业交通部门的工程技术人员斥右派的各种谬论
    据新华社10日讯　中央各工业交通部门的许多工程技术人员，在反右派斗争中，以大量事实说明了新中国的工程技术人员得到共产党和人民政府的一贯信任和支持。
    许多在工业和交通部门担任技术领导职务的工程技术人员，举出他们在新旧中国所处的不同地位等具体事例，驳斥了右派分子所谓工程技术人员“无职无权”或“有职无权”的谬论。建筑工程部设计总局技术处副处长萧巽华说，从1935年起，他就在国民党反动派的机关里作技术工作。从担任绘图员到担任工程师的十几年里，他深深地感到技术人员在当时不过是一个机器，根本谈不上有职有权。他说，解放以后，他刚参加工作不久，组织上就派他领导一千多名职工，负责一项工程的建设。他从1953年调到设计总局技术处工作以后，经常代表局、院直接检查建筑工程，决定设计原则和处理防止技术事故的问题。1957年他被提升为技术处副处长，局里的技术性文件，局长指示必须由他负责审查签字。他说，这难道不是有职有权的最好说明吗？邮电部工程管理局副总工程师许广臣说，局长、副局长同他共同负责工程管理局的领导工作。他个人分工负责的是技术方面的领导工作。局里的技术处和供应处，指定由他具体领导。这两个处的文件都由他签发。他具体负责和参与的工作很多。他说，右派分子硬说解放以后技术人员“有职无权”，这完全是谎言。
    许多工程技术人员还举出事实驳斥右派分子诬蔑共产党“厚己薄人”、提拔干部“先党团员后群众”的谰言。冶金工业部有色金属研究所的技术人员指出，研究所各研究室的十一个主任中，共产党员主任只有四人，七个担任主任职务的是非党技术人员。研究所第二冶金室中的七个大组长中，也只有一个共产党员。煤炭工业部基本建设总局贴出的大字报，举出事实驳斥右派分子说，1956年全局有一百四十五人提了级，其中共产党员四十人，占27％，群众七十四人，占51％。1956年全局提拔科长、工程师以上领导干部二十一人，其中共产党员只有六人。右派分子的恶毒的攻击，是完全没有根据的。轻工业部造纸研究所总工程师张永惠说，解放以前，不知有多少具有特殊技术的人，都没有办法发挥他们的技术才能；而工厂或研究所里，也是受设备、经费和参考资料的限制，技术上无法进步。解放以后，国家委托他负责筹建国营佳木斯造纸厂，这是我国的重点建设工程之一。1956年，他被调来轻工业部造纸研究所任总工程师，一直负责技术领导工作。部里召开重要的技术会议，他都参加。他驳斥右派分子说，他和党员干部之间从来没有什么“沟”和“墙”，在任何工作上，党组织都是信赖和支持他的。他说，现在他不是感到才能不能发挥，只感到自己能力有限，政治水平不高，不能完全适应工作的需要。建筑工程部第二设计院副总工程师乐伯?说，在共产党和人民政府的信任和支持下，他曾经先后担任过工厂副厂长、第一汽车厂工程公司主任工程师、设计院副总工程师的重要职务。1952年他担任华东木材一厂副厂长时，工作上遇到许多困难，党就想各种办法从政治上、工作上帮助他，并且运用党的政治影响在各种场合上支持他。他指出，右派分子企图在职权问题上挑拨党和非党工程技术人员的关系的阴谋，是徒劳的。
    工程技术人员们还指出，在过去的几年中，许多右派分子一直受到国家的重视和信任，其中不少人还担任了重要的领导职务。但是，这些人却故意歪曲事实，混淆是非，利用骗得的信任作掩护，背地里进行反共、反社会主义的勾当。他们指出，右派分子散布的挑拨党和非党工程技术人员关系的谬论，妄图取消党对工程技术界的领导的阴谋，是欺骗不了任何一个正直的工程技术人员的。
