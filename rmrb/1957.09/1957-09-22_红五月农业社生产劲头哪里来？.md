Where Does the Production Enthusiasm of the Red May Agricultural Cooperative Come From?

(Our report) The millet of the Red May Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, is ripe, but the weather has been bad, making it impossible to harvest. On September 5th, the weather was clear, and the members were very happy, but suddenly the village loudspeaker broadcast that the wind was about to pick up, and the members became nervous again. Cooperative member Guo Zhanrong thought: This year's millet is better than any other year, yielding four hundred catties per mu. We must not let the wind blow away the grain that is about to reach our mouths. So he quickly sharpened his sickle to prepare for harvesting. Retired old worker Zhang Shun (who works as a blacksmith in the cooperative) also stepped up his efforts to make agricultural tools and discussed with his three apprentices how to rush to harvest the millet.

The district and township cadres were discussing holding a debate in the evening. Seeing the members were all busy, they didn't even bother to eat lunch and ran to the millet fields. A total of fifty-seven members and cadres harvested one hundred and fifteen mu of millet in one afternoon.

The production enthusiasm of the members of the Red May Cooperative is closely related to the great blooming and contending. In half a month, the members put forward more than 1,700 opinions on the cooperative's leadership and production management. The opinions that could be resolved immediately were quickly resolved. Therefore, the members are very happy, and they are more enthusiastic and proactive in their work. (Photo attached)

The exhibition showed the new clothes, thermos bottles, flashlights and other daily necessities that the members had added after cooperativization, many of which they had never used or worn before liberation. The members said: Visiting the exhibition is a vivid lesson. Without cooperativization, how could we afford them!

### 红五月农业社生产劲头哪里来？

    红五月农业社生产劲头哪里来？
    本报讯　北京市丰台区红五月农业社的谷子成熟了，可是天气一直不好，无法收割。9月5日天气大晴，社员们都很高兴，忽然乡里的大喇叭又广播说要起风，社员们又有些紧张。社员郭占荣心想：今年的谷子比哪一年都强，一亩能打四百斤，到嘴的粮食了，决不能让风给刮跑。于是就赶快磨镰刀，准备收割。退休老工人张顺（在社里打铁）也加紧打农具，并且和他的三个徒弟商量，如何去抢收谷子。
    区、乡干部正在研究晚上开辩论会，看到社员们都忙起来了，于是也没顾得及吃午饭，就跑到谷子地里去了。社员、干部一共五十七人，一个下午就把一百十五亩谷子抢收完了。
    红五月社的社员们生产情绪所以有这么高，同大鸣大放有密切关系。社员们半个月中对社的领导及生产经营管理等工作提了一千七百多条意见，这些意见能立即解决的很快获得了解决。因此社员们都很高兴，干起活来劲头更足，更主动了。（附图片）
