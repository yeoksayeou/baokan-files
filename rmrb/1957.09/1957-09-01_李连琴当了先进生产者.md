    Li Lianqin Became an Advanced Producer
    Sun Guang
    In Tianjin State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, there is a worker named Li Lianqin, who was rated as an advanced producer for eleven consecutive months last year.
    Li Lianqin was originally a worker in the sixth group of the B shift. Her production performance was neither good nor bad. However, after a disagreement with a comrade in the group, a knot formed in her heart. The two of them stopped speaking to each other, and her enthusiasm for production waned. After getting married, she had more housework, which made her even more negative. Gradually, she became less concerned about production and often was absent from work for minor reasons. When she was at work, no one in the group paid attention to her. It was okay if she didn't come to meetings, but if she did, she would be severely criticized. She said, "Anyway, I'm backward, you're progressive. The more you criticize me, the less I'll participate." Although she spoke toughly, she was a little scared inside. Every time she walked through the factory gate, she didn't want to go in. Therefore, the Communist Youth League group identified her as a hopelessly backward element and planned to expel her from the League. Some even requested that she be transferred.
    The leadership felt that the workers in the sixth group lacked patience, so they decided to transfer Li Lianqin to the third group of the B shift.
    The third group of the B shift was an advanced group in the factory. When Li Lianqin heard that she was being transferred there, she was a little scared, wondering how everyone would treat her. She went to the third group with the expectation of being discriminated against. On the first day, when she met Xiang Yulan, the union group leader of the third group, she said, "I'm here to embarrass you."
    Xiang Yulan was a very good union group leader. Before Li Lianqin arrived, she had analyzed the reasons for her backwardness and was determined to help her. She warmly said to Li Lianqin, "We need experienced workers like you!" The workers in the group also warmly welcomed her, encouraged her, and introduced her to the group's situation and the performance of the new machines. During breaks, everyone pulled her into their conversations and laughter. After work, when the workshop was going to hold a meeting, the group leader said to her, "You have children, go home early! I'll tell you about the meeting tomorrow." She had never experienced such concern from her comrades in the sixth group. She felt an indescribable warmth in her heart.
    One day, Li Lianqin fell ill, but the doctor didn't diagnose it and didn't give her a sick leave slip. She thought, "If you don't approve my leave, I'll be absent from work." So she went home without asking for leave. After work, Xiang Yulan and Yue Changlan went to see her in the light rain. They comforted her and criticized her for her absence. The next day, Xiang Yulan got a doctor for her and sent the approved leave certificate to her home. Li Lianqin reflected, "In the past, if I got sick, they would say I was faking it. This time is different. I can't be like I was before." After Li Lianqin recovered, she worked with great enthusiasm. In just two days, she learned an advanced technique. The group, seeing her progress, immediately praised her and even had her demonstrate the operation method at the group's technical study session. Li Lianqin became active and was rated as an advanced producer for eleven consecutive months last year.
    The news of Li Lianqin's transformation quickly spread throughout the factory. When the workers in the sixth group of the B shift heard about it, they humbly learned from the experience of the third group and transformed Tian Baoji in their group. Now, the sixth group has also become an advanced group. (Attached picture)

    李连琴当了先进生产者
    孙光
    天津国棉四厂有个工人叫李连琴，去年一连十一个月都被评为先进生产者。
    李连琴原是乙班六组的工人，以前的生产成绩虽不算好，也不算坏。但是，自从跟小组里的一个同志闹了一次意见以后，心里就结了个疙瘩，两个人见面总是不说话，生产热情也不如从前了。加上结婚以后，家务事多了，情绪更消极，渐渐对生产也不关心了，经常因小事旷工。她上班的时候，小组里的人谁也不理她，每次开会，她不来还可以，一来就狠狠地批评她。她说：反正我落后，你们进步，你们越批评，我越不参加。她嘴虽硬，但心里却有点害怕，每次走进工厂的大门就不想往里走了。因此，团小组便认定她是个死落后分子，准备开除她的团籍，有的人并要求把她调走。
    领导上觉得六组的工人没有耐性，便决定把李连琴调到乙班三组去。
    乙班三组是厂里的一个先进小组。李连琴听说调那里去，心里有点害怕，不知道大家怎样对待她。她是抱着准备被歧视的态度到三组去的。第一天，见到三组的工会小组长相玉兰的时候，就说：“我给你们现眼来了”。
    相玉兰是个很好的工会小组长，李连琴没来以前，她就分析过她落后的原因，并且决心帮助她。她很热情地对李连琴说：“我们正需要像你这样的老工人呢！”小组里的工人也很热情地欢迎她，鼓励她，给她介绍组里的情况和新车的性能。休息的时候，大伙把她拉在一起，有说有笑的。下班后，车间要开会，组长对她说：“你有小孩，提前回去吧！明天我再告诉你会议内容”。同志们这样关心她，在六组是从来没有的。她心里感到有一种说不出来的温暖。
    有一天，李连琴生病，医生没有看出来，没给她开假条。她想：你不准我假，我就旷工，于是没请假就回家了。下班以后，相玉兰和岳长兰冒着小雨去看她。她俩一面安慰她，一面批评她旷工的错误。第二天，相玉兰又给她请了大夫，并把准假证明送到她家里。李连琴回想：过去要是生了病，又说我装着玩了，这回可不同，以后再不能像过去那样了。李连琴病好以后，工作挺有劲，两天的功夫就学会了一项先进经验。小组看她有了进步，立刻表扬她，还让她在小组技术学习会上表演操作法。李连琴就这样积极起来了，去年连续十一个月被评为先进生产者。
    李连琴转变的消息，很快传遍全厂。乙班六组的工人知道了，就虚心学习三组的经验，把小组里的田宝季也改造过来了。现在，六组也成了先进小组。（附图片）
