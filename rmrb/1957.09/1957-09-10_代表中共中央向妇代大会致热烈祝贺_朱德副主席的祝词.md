Comrade Delegates:

The Third National Women's Congress of China is opening today. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I extend warm congratulations to this congress and to women across the country.

In the four years since the Second National Women's Congress of China, our society has undergone unprecedented changes. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our people have basically completed the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production, established a socialist system, and carried out large-scale socialist construction. The broad masses of women in our country have actively participated in socialist transformation and socialist construction, and have made tremendous contributions. Due to the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, women in our country have fundamentally ended the history of being oppressed, exploited, and enslaved for thousands of years, have shaken off the long-term national oppression and class oppression they suffered, have gained equal rights with men in all aspects, and have achieved women's liberation, becoming masters of the country and society together with the people of the whole country. This is a great victory of historical significance.

Now, our country has entered a new historical period. Our task is to continue to establish and consolidate our socialist system, concentrate our efforts on developing our country's social productive forces, and, through ten to fifteen years of effort, transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. This task is extremely great and glorious, but it also involves many difficulties. The people of the whole country must unite as one, work together, and implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, running cooperatives with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, as put forward by the Communist Party of China, in order to rapidly develop our industry, agriculture, and other construction undertakings. The liberated Chinese women are a great force. The Communist Party of China's organizations at all levels must continue to implement the policy of "mobilizing both men and women" in all work, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of women in building socialism. We believe that our women will work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, and shoulder the glorious task of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift, and striving for the construction of socialism.

The material and cultural lives of the broad masses of our people have greatly improved in recent years, but the lives of many families are still not prosperous. The fundamental way to make the lives of the broad masses of our people prosperous is to strive to develop our industrial and agricultural production, which is the material foundation for continuously improving the lives of our people. However, if every housewife can manage household affairs diligently and thriftily, plan household expenses in a planned way, and strive to develop household sideline production under possible conditions to increase family income and reduce unnecessary expenses, then they will definitely be able to continuously improve family life, increase social wealth, and thus make significant contributions to the cause of socialist construction. Housework is an indispensable part of social life, and managing a household diligently and thriftily is an important aspect of implementing the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift. Therefore, any idea that despises housework or despises managing a household diligently and thriftily is completely wrong. The working people of our country have a fine tradition of managing households diligently and thriftily, which should be inherited and carried forward. We hope that the All-China Women's Federation will lead the broad masses of women to make outstanding achievements in this regard.

In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women in participating in the construction of socialism, it is necessary to continuously improve their socialist consciousness. At present, our people are engaged in a struggle against the bourgeois rightists. This is a great socialist revolution carried out on the political and ideological fronts following the basic victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front in 1956. The rightists are trying to overthrow our country's socialist system and drag our country back to the dark road of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, which our people will never allow. For the sake of the interests of our socialist country and for the sake of the liberation of women themselves, women across the country must actively participate in the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, actively participate in the current nationwide debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism, so as to correct the political direction, raise ideological awareness, and unswervingly continue to advance on the bright road of socialism.

The All-China Women's Federation is a mass women's organization led by the Communist Party of China, based on working women, and uniting women from all walks of life. The work of the All-China Women's Federation has made great achievements since the Second National Congress. In the new historical period, in order for the All-China Women's Federation to better unite women across the country to exert greater strength in building socialism, it must further strengthen the mass viewpoint and implement the working method of the mass line; it must care for and reflect the interests and demands of women, and continue to wage a resolute struggle against ideas and behaviors that discriminate against and harm women and children; it must strive to serve the masses of women in all aspects, especially to organize the masses' own strength to further develop women's and children's welfare undertakings, so as to make the Women's Federation and the masses of women more closely linked.

Comrades! Although the task of building socialism is arduous, as long as the people of our country unite more closely on the basis of socialism, resolutely implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift put forward by the Communist Party of China, as long as the people of our country and the people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union unite more closely, and strengthen the unity with the forces of peace and progress in all countries of the world, then any difficulties facing us can be overcome, and a great, prosperous, and strong socialist new China will definitely be established.

    代表中共中央向妇代大会致热烈祝贺
    朱德副主席的祝词
    亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国妇女第三次全国代表大会今天开幕了，我谨代表中国共产党中央委员会，向这次大会和全国妇女致热烈的祝贺。
    从中国妇女第二次全国代表大会以来四年多的时间中，我国社会发生了空前的大变革。我国人民在中国共产党的领导下，基本上完成了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，建立起社会主义制度，进行了大规模的社会主义建设。我国广大妇女群众积极地参加了社会主义改造和社会主义建设，并且做出了巨大的贡献。由于人民民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，我国妇女已经从根本上结束了几千年来被压迫、被剥削、被奴役的历史，摆脱了长期遭受的民族压迫和阶级压迫，在各方面获得了同男子平等的权利，实现了妇女的解放，和全国人民一起成为国家和社会的主人。这是一个有历史意义的伟大胜利。
    现在，我国已进入一个新的历史时期。我们的任务，就是要继续建立和巩固我们的社会主义制度，集中力量发展我国的社会生产力，再经过十年到十五年的努力，把我国从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。这个任务是极其伟大和光荣的，但是也是有很多困难的。全国人民必须团结一致，同心协力，贯彻执行中国共产党所提出的勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，勤俭办合作社，勤俭办一切事业的方针，来迅速地发展我们的工业、农业和其他建设事业。已经获得了解放的中国妇女是一支伟大的力量。中国共产党的各级组织在各项工作中必须继续贯彻执行“男女一齐发动”的方针，充分发挥广大妇女群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，我们相信，我们妇女一定会努力增产，厉行节约，担负起勤俭建国，勤俭持家，为建设社会主义而奋斗的光荣任务。
    我国广大人民的物质文化生活几年来有了很大的改善，但是，很多家庭的生活还是不富裕的。要使我国广大人民的生活都富裕起来，根本的办法是努力发展我国的工业和农业生产，这是不断改善我国人民生活的物质基础。但是，如果每个家庭主妇都能够勤俭地操持家务，有计划地安排家务开支，并且在可能的条件下努力开展家庭副业生产，来增加家庭的收入、减少不必要的支出，那就一定能够不断地改善家庭生活，增加社会财富，从而对社会主义建设事业作出重大的贡献。家务劳动是社会生活所不可缺少的一部分劳动，勤俭持家是执行勤俭建国方针的一个重要方面。所以任何轻视家务劳动、轻视勤俭持家的思想都是完全错误的。我国劳动人民是有勤俭持家的优良传统的，应当加以继承和发扬，我们希望全国妇联带动广大妇女在这方面做出出色的成绩来。
    为了发挥广大妇女参加建设社会主义的积极性，必须不断地提高她们的社会主义觉悟。目前，我国人民正在进行反对资产阶级右派的斗争。这是继1956年在经济战线上的社会主义革命取得基本胜利之后，在政治战线上和思想战线上进行的伟大的社会主义革命。右派分子企图推翻我国的社会主义制度，把我国重新拉回到半殖民地半封建社会的黑暗道路上去，这是我国人民决不能允许的。为了我们社会主义国家的利益，为了妇女自身解放的利益，全国妇女必须积极地参加反对资产阶级右派的斗争，积极地参加目前正在全国范围内进行的关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论，从而端正政治方向，提高思想觉悟，坚定不移地在社会主义的光明道路上继续前进。
    中国妇女联合会是在中国共产党的领导下，以劳动妇女为基础团结各阶层妇女的妇女群众组织。全国妇联组织从第二次全国代表大会以来的工作有很大的成绩。在新的历史时期中，全国妇联组织要能够更好地团结全国妇女在建设社会主义中发挥出更大的力量，就必须进一步加强群众观点，贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法；就必须关怀和反映妇女的利益和要求，对歧视和损害妇女、儿童的思想和行为，继续进行坚决的斗争；就必须在各方面努力为妇女群众服务，特别是要组织群众自己的力量来进一步发展妇女儿童福利事业，使妇联和妇女群众更加密切地联系起来。
    同志们！建设社会主义的任务虽然艰巨，但是只要我们全国人民在社会主义的基础上，更加紧密地团结起来，坚决地执行中国共产党所提出的勤俭建国的方针，只要我国人民和以苏联为首的社会主义各国的人民更加紧密地团结起来，并且加强同世界各国和平和进步的力量的团结，那么，摆在我们面前的任何困难都是能够战胜的，一个伟大的富强的社会主义的新中国，一定能够建立起来。
