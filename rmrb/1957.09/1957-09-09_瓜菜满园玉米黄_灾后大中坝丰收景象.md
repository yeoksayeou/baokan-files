    Melon and Vegetable Gardens Overflow, Corn Turns Yellow
    ——A Post-Disaster Harvest Scene in Dazhongba——
    Dazhongba is a sandbar in the Jialing River near Nanchong City, Sichuan Province. The gardens on the dam are full of melons and fruits, the vegetables are lush and green, and strings of golden corn hang from the bamboo fences and eaves, creating a joyous harvest scene everywhere. It's hard to believe that this is the place that suffered the worst flood in fifty-three years last year.
    The recovery work after the disaster was rapid: during the flood, the government allocated sufficient relief grain and funds; after the flood receded, it lent more than 6,000 yuan to the agricultural cooperative. With the strong support of the state, the members quickly recovered, rebuilt their homes, and resumed production.
    This spring, the members transformed the sandy land that had been washed away by the flood and planted watermelons. They also implemented intercropping and mixed cropping in the vegetable fields, and sideline production is also booming. According to the estimate of the total harvest: in addition to each member receiving more than 200 jin of rations, each household can also receive more than 200 yuan in cash. Now the cooperative's loans have been repaid, and the members have returned to their pre-disaster living standards.
    Older farmers believe this is a miracle. Before liberation, in 1945 and 1949, this place suffered two flood disasters. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government not only did not provide relief, but also took advantage of the fire to rob, sending ships to plunder the property of the victims. Grain prices soared on the dam, and farmers fled famine everywhere.
    People are good at making comparisons. The reporter visited many peasant families, and they sincerely thanked the leadership of the Communist Party. They said: "With such a large flood as last year, without the People's Government, without agricultural cooperation, without the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, let alone a short year, we would not be able to recover in five years!"

    Right picture: After Dazhongba suffered a flood, the government not only exempted public grain, but also supplied more than 8,000 jin of rice. In addition to the bumper early corn harvest in the cooperative this year, the members have all received new grain. Luo Ronghua, the mother of five children, said: "Although we suffered a major flood last year, my children still eat very well."
    Bottom picture: The members are very enthusiastic about production. This year, the income from watermelons alone was more than 4,000 yuan.

### 瓜菜满园玉米黄  灾后大中坝丰收景象

    瓜菜满园玉米黄
    ——灾后大中坝丰收景象——
    大中坝是四川省南充市附近嘉陵江中的一块沙坝。坝上的瓜果满园，菜蔬葱绿，金黄成串的玉米悬挂在竹篱和屋檐上，到处是一片喜庆丰收的景象。人们很难相信，这就是去年遭受了五十三年来最大洪水灾害的地方。
    灾后的恢复工作是迅速的：在洪水期间，政府拨给了足够的救济粮和救济款；洪水退了以后，又贷给农业社六千多元。社员们在国家的大力支援下，很快就爬了起来，重建了家园，投入了生产。
    今年春天，社员们改造了被洪水冲过的沙质地，种上了西瓜；并且在蔬菜地里实行了间种和套种，副业生产也在蓬勃发展。根据全部收成估计：每个社员除能分到二百多斤口粮外，每户还可分到二百多元现金。现在社里的贷款已经还清了，社员们已回复到灾前的生活水平。
    上了年岁的农民都认为这是个奇迹。解放前的1945年和1949年，这里曾两次遭遇洪水灾害。那时，国民党反动政府非但不救济，还乘火打劫，派船大肆抢夺灾民财物。坝上粮价高涨，农民四处逃荒。
    人们是善于比较的。记者访问了很多户农民家庭，他们衷心感激共产党的领导。他们说：“像去年那样大的水灾，不是人民政府，不是农业合作化，不是实行粮食统购统销，莫说短短一年，就是五年也翻不了身！”
