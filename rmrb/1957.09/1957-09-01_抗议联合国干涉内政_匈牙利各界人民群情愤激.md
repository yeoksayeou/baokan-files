Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 31st:  The wave of protests from all walks of life in Hungary against the United Nations "Five-Member Committee" report and the United Nations General Assembly's preparation to discuss this report is growing.

    On August 30th, workers from the Csepel factory in Budapest sent a delegation to Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath, handing over a petition signed by over 22,000 workers from the Csepel factory. Horvath told the worker delegation that the Hungarian government would send a delegation to New York to deliver this petition, along with the thousands upon thousands of protest telegrams and signature books received recently, to the United Nations.

    The Csepel workers' protest letter stated that the Csepel workers were particularly angered by the part of the "Five-Member Committee" report that concerned Csepel. This part insisted that the Soviet Air Force bombed Csepel and that the Csepel workers had organized and fought against the Soviet army. This is a complete fabrication. Not only did Csepel not have a single bomb dropped on it, but the workers did not fight against the Soviet army.

    The Csepel workers believe that the United Nations "Five-Member Committee" report can only be a continuation of the slanderous propaganda conducted by Western countries against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. They demand that the so-called "Hungarian question" be removed from the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

    Officers and soldiers of the Hungarian People's Army have written many letters of protest to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in recent days. In these letters, some soldiers said that they participated in the struggle against the counter-revolution and fought alongside the Soviet army. They expressed extreme indignation at the United Nations report that the Hungarian army opposed the Soviet army.

    The Hungarian Catholic Bishops' Conference published a statement in "People's Freedom Daily" on August 30th, saying that the "Five-Member Committee" report established by the United Nations to study the so-called "Hungarian question" and the upcoming discussion of this report by the United Nations General Assembly caused the Bishops' Conference to worry. The result of the discussion based on this one-sided report will exacerbate international tensions and threaten the fundamental interests of our country. The Bishops' Conference expressed its support for the efforts of the worker-peasant revolutionary government for the happiness and peace of the Hungarian people and the consolidation of international peace.

    抗议联合国干涉内政
    匈牙利各界人民群情愤激
    新华社布达佩斯31日电  匈牙利各界人民抗议联合国“五人委员会”的报告以及联合国大会准备讨论这个报告的浪潮越来越高涨。
    8月30日，布达佩斯切佩尔工厂工人派出了一个代表团，将切佩尔工厂二万二千多名工人亲笔签名的一份抗议书交给了匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特。霍瓦特向工人代表团说，匈牙利政府将派代表团去纽约，把这份抗议书和最近收到的成千成万份抗议电报和签名册一起交给联合国。
    切佩尔工人的抗议书说，切佩尔工人特别对“五人委员会”报告中涉及切佩尔的部分感到愤怒。这部分硬说苏联空军轰炸了切佩尔，切佩尔工人曾经有组织地同苏军作战。这完全是捏造的。切佩尔不但没有落过一个炸弹，工人也没有同苏军作战。
    切佩尔工人认为，联合国“五人委员会”的报告只能是西方国家对苏联和人民民主国家所进行的诽谤宣传的继续。他们要求把所谓“匈牙利问题”从联合国大会的议程上撤消。
    匈牙利人民军各部队官兵连日来给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德写了许多抗议信，在这些信里，有的战士说，他们参加了反对反革命的斗争，曾经和苏军一起并肩作战。他们对联合国的报告中说匈牙利军队反对苏军表示万分愤慨。
    匈牙利天主教会主教团8月30日在“人民自由报”上发表声明说，联合国为了研究所谓“匈牙利问题”而成立的“五人委员会”的报告以及联合国大会即将对这个报告的讨论使主教团感到忧虑。根据这个片面性的报告讨论的结果将会加剧国际紧张局势，威胁到我们国家的根本利益。主教团表示支持工农革命政府为了匈牙利人民的幸福和安宁以及巩固国际和平的努力。
