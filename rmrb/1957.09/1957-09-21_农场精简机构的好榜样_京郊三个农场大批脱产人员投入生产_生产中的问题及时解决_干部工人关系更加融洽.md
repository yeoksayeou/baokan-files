Xinhua News Agency, September 20th - Another state-owned farm and a joint state-private livestock farm in Beijing have vigorously streamlined their personnel detached from production.

The Beijing Municipal State-Owned Xijiao (Western Suburbs) Farm originally had seventy-one non-productive personnel, which has now been reduced to thirteen, lowering the proportion of non-productive personnel from 11.7% of the total number of employees to 1.9%. The joint state-private Dongjiao (Eastern Suburbs) Livestock Farm had one hundred and twenty non-productive personnel at the beginning of this year, accounting for 13.3% of the total number of employees, which has recently been reduced to thirteen, accounting for 1.5% of the total number of employees. Thus, along with the relatively large-scale state-owned Nanjiao (Southern Suburbs) Farm, which recently reduced its non-productive personnel to 1.2% of the total number of employees, Beijing has three farms that have achieved success in streamlining their management organizations, setting a good example for state-owned and locally state-owned farms in China to change the current situation of bloated and oversized organizations and excessively high management costs.

The Xijiao Farm has more than 12,000 mu of land and more than 600 employees, with the main business being the production of fruits, vegetables, and milk. The Dongjiao Livestock Farm has 2,000 dairy cows and more than 800 employees. After streamlining the non-productive personnel, the general headquarters of both units has ten people, including the farm director, the Party committee and Youth League secretaries, accountants, and other administrative personnel. Both units have three branch farms. After streamlining, only one branch farm director is detached from production at the Xijiao Farm, and the remaining personnel, such as technicians, accountants, statisticians, and sales personnel, all participate in labor. At the Dongjiao Livestock Farm, the directors of all three branch farms have participated in labor, with each branch farm leaving one accountant to facilitate the calculation of milk production, costs, and so on.

According to the heads of these farms, the "Labor is glorious, thrift and economy" campaign in Beijing's institutions has greatly promoted their work of streamlining management organizations. After a large number of cadres from Beijing's institutions went to the countryside to participate in labor and production for long periods, the farm cadres said: If the cadres from institutions can participate in labor and production, why can't we go down? After the staff of these three farms discussed the streamlining plan proposed by the Party committee and administrative leaders, almost all the staff in each farm signed up to request to go to labor. Some people even rushed home overnight to discuss it with their spouses, and the next day they returned to the farm to sign up.

After a large number of cadres detached from production went to the fields to work, not only was work efficiency greatly improved, but the relationship between cadres and workers became more harmonious. After the cadres of the Nanjiao Farm worked with the workers on September 7th, the workers went to comfort them. The workers asked, "Are you tired?" The cadres said, "Not tired." The workers then looked at the cadres' hands to see if they had blisters. Then the workers said, "Don't be too hasty, rest when you are tired." It is said that such kind words were relatively rare in the past.

Will the participation of technical personnel in labor hinder their research work? In the past, they had this concern. Now, after participating in labor, the technicians replied: Definitely not. They said that it is not easy to really see how much the growth and development of crops and the feeding and management of livestock change by just going down to take a look. Relying solely on knowledge from books to guide production, without observing and researching in labor practice, cannot obtain truly useful knowledge.

After streamlining the management organizations, these three farms also reformed their work systems and methods. In the past, the Xijiao Farm had many accounting books and statistical reports, with six accounting and statistical personnel in the general headquarters. The three branch farms, plus a vegetable team and a machinery team, also had eight accounting and statistical personnel. Now, the accounting books and statistical items have been greatly simplified, and the general headquarters has four accounting and statistical personnel to manage the overall accounting work of the farm. In the past, each branch farm had a personnel secretary whose main job was to manage ideological education and write reports. Now, ideological education can be done anytime, anywhere because many leading cadres are participating in labor; reports and the like can be handled by the branch farm director himself, or can be solved with a phone call, and the personnel secretary has also been eliminated. This approach has made the connection between the general farm director and the branch farm directors closer.

When streamlining the management organization, the Dongjiao Livestock Farm paid attention to solving the problem of how leading cadres should lead production after participating in labor. Now, after the branch farm directors and other cadres go down, they do the work of feeding, cutting green feed, and other odd jobs, and work with the workers. After work, they take some time to report on the work situation and the problems that have occurred, and deal with them immediately. The workers are very satisfied with this approach. The workers said that in the past, the cadres would just take a stroll and leave, but the current style is different. The cadres also feel that they have better ways to work. By participating in production labor themselves, they understand the situation in more detail, and many things are resolved on the spot, instead of having to take them to the office to be resolved as in the past.

Private personnel holding leadership positions at the Dongjiao Livestock Farm, along with public personnel, have also been transferred to production to participate in labor. Zuo Lianyou, the deputy director of the first branch farm, is a private person. After participating in labor, he still normally takes charge of the leadership duties he was previously assigned. He said that participating in actual production has many benefits for him in terms of familiarizing himself with the production situation and training himself.

    农场精简机构的好榜样
    京郊三个农场大批脱产人员投入生产
    生产中的问题及时解决　干部工人关系更加融洽
    新华社20日讯　北京市又有一个地方国营农场和一个公私合营畜牧农场，大力精简了脱离生产的人员。
    北京市地方国营西郊农场原有脱离生产人员七十一人，现在已减少到十三人，使脱离生产人员从占职工人数的11.7％降低到1.9％；公私合营东郊畜牧场在今年年初有脱离生产人员一百二十人，占职工人数的13.3％，最近精简到十三人，占职工人数的1.5％。这样，连同最近把脱离生产人员减少到职工人数1.2％的规模较大的地方国营南郊农场在内，北京市已有三个农场在精简管理机构方面获得成就，为我国国营、地方国营农场改变目前机构臃肿庞大、管理费用过高的情况，树立了良好榜样。
    西郊农场有一万二千多亩地，职工六百多人，以生产水果、蔬菜、牛乳为主要业务；东郊畜牧场有二千头乳牛，职工八百多人。精简脱离生产人员后，这两个单位的总场部都是十个人，包括场长、党委和团委书记、会计以及其他行政人员。两个单位都有三个分场，精简后，西郊农场的分场只有一个分场场长脱离生产，其余人员如技术员、会计、统计、供销人员等都参加劳动；东郊畜牧场三个分场的场长都已参加劳动，每个分场留下一个会计，便于计算牛乳产量、成本等。
    据这几个农场的负责人谈：“劳动光荣、勤俭节约”在北京市机关里成为一种政治空气和社会风气后，对他们精简管理机构工作起了很大的推动作用。北京市大批机关干部下乡长期参加劳动生产，农场干部就说：机关干部都参加劳动生产，难道我们不能下去吗？这三个农场的工作人员在讨论党委和行政领导干部提出的精简编制方案后，每个农场里几乎全体工作人员都报名要求去劳动。有的人还连夜赶回家里，和自己爱人商量，第二天回到场里就报名。
    大批脱离生产的干部下地劳动以后，不仅工作效率大大提高，而且干部和工人之间的关系更加融洽了。南郊农场的干部在9月7日第一天和工人们一起劳动以后，工人就去慰问他们。工人问：“累不累？”干部说：“不累”。工人又去看看干部的手，有没有磨出泡来。接着工人说：“不要操之过急，累了要休息。”据说，这样亲切的语言，过去是比较少的。
    技术人员参加劳动以后，会不会妨碍他们的研究工作？过去，他们是有这个顾虑的。现在参加劳动后，技术员们答复说：肯定不会。他们说，作物的生长发育、牲畜的饲养管理，平时下去看一看，不容易真正看出多少变化来。单纯依靠书本上的知识去指导生产，不在劳动实践中去观察研究，是不能得到真正有用的知识的。
    这三个农场在精简管理机构以后，对工作制度和工作方法，也进行了改革。过去，西郊农场会计账目和统计表报很多，总场有会计统计人员六人；三个分场加上一个蔬菜队、一个机务队，也有会计统计人员八人。现在，把会计账目、统计项目大量精简，总场设四个会计、统计人员，总管全场会计工作。过去，每个分场里都有一个人事秘书，主要工作是管思想教育工作和写报告，现在，思想教育工作因为许多领导干部都参加劳动，随时随地都可以做；写报告之类，由分场场长自己动手，或者打个电话就可以解决，人事秘书也取消了。这样做法使总场场长和分场场长的联系更加密切了。
    东郊畜牧场在精简管理机构时，注意解决领导干部参加劳动后怎样来领导生产的问题。现在分场场长等干部下去后，做的是喂饲料、切青饲料及其他杂工，和工人们一起劳动。他们在下班以后，就抽出一些时间汇报工作情况和发生的问题，并且立即进行处理。这种做法，工人很满意。工人说，过去干部下来只是蹓一圈就走了，现在的作风可不同了。干部也感到工作更有办法，他们自己参加生产劳动，了解的情况更加详细，许多事情当场解决，不要像过去那样要拿到办公室去解决了。
    在东郊畜牧场担任领导职务的私方人员，也和公方人员一起，都下放到生产中参加劳动。一分场副场长左连有是个私方人员，在参加劳动之后，仍照常负责他以前所分工的领导职务，他说：参加实际生产以后，对他熟悉生产情况、锻炼自己，好处很多。
