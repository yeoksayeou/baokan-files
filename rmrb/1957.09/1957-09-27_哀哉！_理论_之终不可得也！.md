    Alas! The "Theory" is Ultimately Unattainable!
    Zhuang Nong
    Thirty years ago, Zhang Naiqi was determined to create a "revolutionary theory that is more complete, more thorough, and more effective than communist doctrine." At the time, he said: "Only revolutionary anti-communism is effective anti-communism. Only revolutionary anti-communist theory is effective anti-communist theory. Everyone knows that the most dangerous thing is the communist poison in the minds of young people. Therefore, to remove the deep-rooted communist poison from the minds of young people, we can only instill a revolutionary theory that is more complete, more thorough, and more effective than communist doctrine." Zhang Naiqi's ambition to oppose communism can be said to be great, but he ultimately admitted from the opposite perspective that, before his "revolutionary theory that is more complete, more thorough, and more effective than communist doctrine" was born, communist doctrine was the most complete, most thorough, and most effective revolutionary theory. This is what he reluctantly acknowledged, but could not deny.
    Thirty years have passed. Zhang Naiqi has worked hard to "instill" a lot of anti-communist things into people (not just young people), but a "revolutionary anti-communist theory" that is better than "communist doctrine" has never been created. Because this is impossible.
    Zhang Naiqi has pieced together some things. For example, "what red capitalist," what "fixed interest is not exploitation, but just unearned income," "the bourgeoisie is more advanced than the working class"... and so on. These "anti-communism" are very "anti-communist," but calling them "revolutionary theory" is too "exaggerated." Because not only people with "communist poison" do not believe in this, but even the majority of the bourgeoisie regard it as "bourgeois poison" and refuse to accept it; moreover, these so-called "theoretical" things, as soon as you poke them, become a pile of rotten mess, which is truly a well-deserved "mess," and even the bourgeois rightists may not take it seriously, let alone others.
    The "theory" that has not been created after decades of hard work and practice under the support of the Kuomintang's guns will certainly have even less hope of appearing in the future; then, the truly most complete, most thorough, and most effective "communist doctrine" will have to prevail in this world. Zhang Naiqi and his ilk cannot help but lament, but there is nothing they can do.

    哀哉！“理论”之终不可得也！
    庄农
    三十年前，章乃器就立志要创立一套“比共产学说更完善、更透彻、更有效的革命理论。”当时他说：“只有革命的反共，才是有效的反共。只有革命的反共理论，才是有效的反共理论。谁都晓得，最危险的要算是青年心理中的共产毒。所以要从青年心理中逐去深入的共产毒，只有灌输比共产学说更完善、更透彻、更有效的革命理论。”章乃器反共之志可说是大矣哉，但他终究从反面承认了，在他的“比共产学说更完善、更透彻、更有效的革命理论”问世以前，共产学说是最完善、最透彻、更有效的革命理论了。这是他虽心所不愿，但又无法不承认的话。
    三十年过去了。章乃器曾努力向人们（不只青年）“灌输”了不少反共的东西，但“比共产学说”更好的“反共革命理论”，却终于没有创立出来。因为这是不可能的。
    章乃器是拼凑过一些东西的。比如“什么红色资本家”啦，什么“定息不是剥削，只是不劳而获”啦，“资产阶级比工人阶级更进步”啦……等等。这些“反共”是很“反共”了，但叫做“革命理论”还是太“言过其实”了的。因为不仅有“共产毒”的人不信这一套，就连资产阶级中的多数，也把这看作“资产毒”而拒不接受；而且这所谓“理论”的东西，只须一戳，便成稀烂一团，真是名副其实的“拆烂污”，就连资产阶级右派也未必拿来当真的，何况另外的人。
    在国民党枪杆支持之下，经过几十年的努力钻研和实践，终于没有创立起来的“理论”，今后当然是更没有希望出现了；那末，就只好由真正最完善、最透彻、最有效的“共产学说”来风行这世界了。章乃器之流不免呜呼哀哉，然而又没有什么法子。
