Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 2nd: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who is currently vacationing in Hakone, made a statement to reporters on September 1st, continuing to defend his unfriendly policies towards China. He said that he is not particularly unfriendly to China.

Kishi Nobusuke reiterated that it is still too early to recognize China or support China's restoration of its seat in the United Nations under the current circumstances. However, he also said that he did not mean to never recognize China.

On the same day, Xiongichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, published an article in the English-language "Japan Times" criticizing the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy towards China. Yamamoto said that the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy towards China "is like two horses pulling a cart in opposite directions," and pointed out that this policy is no longer feasible. He called for a new, flexible policy. He believes that even without considering Japan's diplomatic recognition of China, there are other ways to improve relations between Japan and China.

Yamamoto said that the Nobusuke Kishi government's shameless and anachronistic policy of only wanting to expand trade with China while completely ignoring other issues between the two countries is doomed to failure sooner or later.

    日本国际贸易促进协会会长
    批评政府对华政策自相矛盾
    岸信介自称对中国并不是特别不友好
    新华社2日讯  东京消息：正在箱根休养的日本首相岸信介9月1日向记者发表谈话，继续为他对中国的不友好政策辩解，他说他对中国并不是特别不友好。
    岸信介重申，在目前情况下承认中国或者支持中国恢复在联合国的席位还为时过早。但是，他又说，他并不是想永远不承认中国。
    日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一同一天在英文“日本时报”上发表文章，批评了岸信介政府对中国的政策。山本说，岸信介政府对中国的政策“好似两匹方向相反的马在拉一辆车子”，他指出这种政策不再行得通了。他要求采取新的、灵活的政策。他认为，即使不考虑日本在外交上承认中国，也还有别的办法来改善日本和中国的关系。
    山本说，岸信介政府光想扩大同中国贸易而完全漠视两国间其它问题的无耻的、时代错误的政策，早晚要以失败告终。
