Instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council
on the Cotton Unified Purchase Work for This Year

In the year from September 1956 to August 1957, due to cotton field disasters and shortcomings in the state’s purchase work, the amount of cotton purchased by the state decreased, which seriously affected the supply of cotton cloth. This year's cotton planting area is smaller than the previous year, but most of this year's cotton is growing well. If there are no major natural disasters in the future, it is still possible to purchase more cotton.

At present, new cotton has begun to be available on the market, and the cotton unified purchase work is about to enter a tense stage. The Party and government leading organs in all cotton-producing areas must immediately make special arrangements for the cotton unified purchase work, educate cotton farmers to establish the ideology of building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily, produce and sell more, retain less and use sparingly, dry and pick cleanly, and sell more good cotton to the state, criticize the capitalist ideology of some cotton farmers who retain more and sell less and attempt to sell at high prices on the free market, and correct the one-sided "mass viewpoint" and departmentalism of some cadres; they must seize the opportunity of the peak season for cotton purchase, take the necessary time, organize forces from all sides, mobilize the masses, and devote all efforts to the cotton picking and purchase work, and be sure to complete the cotton unified purchase task in a short period of time.

In order to successfully complete the cotton unified purchase task, the cotton-producing areas are required to earnestly do the following tasks well.

First, the amount of cotton retained for use by agricultural cooperatives and farmers must be appropriately reduced. According to reports from many places, after the method of retaining cotton based on the cooperative was implemented, the total amount of cotton retained by farmers increased compared to before collectivization, and in fact, farmers cannot use three jin of cotton per person. As a result, many cotton farmers sell the cotton they cannot use on the free market, which not only affects the state's control of necessary cotton resources, but also has an adverse effect on market stability. Therefore, starting this year, it is necessary to appropriately compress and control the amount of cotton retained by farmers through persuasion and education, based on the spirit of retaining less and selling more, retaining inferior cotton for use and delivering good cotton for sale. Under normal circumstances, each person can only retain two jin of cotton; if it is indeed difficult to compress to two jin in a few concentrated production areas, it can be compressed slightly less, but the amount of cotton retained per person must not exceed two and a half jin; the cotton required for public use by agricultural cooperatives is also included in the retention standard. In decentralized production areas where cotton production is not enough for retention, efforts should also be made to purchase some cotton through consultation.

Second, strengthen the management of local spinning and weaving and the cotton and local cloth markets. Compared with machine spinning and weaving, local spinning and weaving wastes a lot of cotton. One jin of cotton used for local spinning and weaving can weave at most twenty square feet of cloth, while machine weaving can weave more than thirty square feet, and the difference is even greater if weaving high-grade cloth or knitwear. In the past few years, in order to take care of the handicraftsmen who rely mainly on local spinning and weaving for their livelihood, and to take care of the habit of some people wearing local cloth, the state has still adopted a policy of appropriately maintaining local spinning and weaving, which is necessary. However, in some places, agricultural cooperatives have developed sideline production excessively, resulting in excessive development of local spinning and weaving, which has wasted cotton and affected cotton purchase and machine-woven cloth production. Therefore, in the future, agricultural cooperatives and cotton farmers should be persuaded not to engage in sideline production using cotton as raw material in general. For handicraft households that originally relied mainly on local spinning and weaving for their livelihood, state-owned commercial departments or supply and marketing cooperatives should plan the production and purchase of local cloth. When farmers sell the local cloth woven from their own retained cotton, they must also sell it to commercial departments designated by the state. It is forbidden for cotton, local yarn, and local cloth to enter the free market, and the State Council's regulations prohibiting agricultural products and other materials under state planned purchase (unified purchase) and unified purchase from entering the free market must be resolutely implemented.

Third, the supply of wadded cotton must be appropriately compressed. The supply of wadded cotton has been increasing year by year, increasing by 13.9% in 1955 compared to 1954, and increasing by another 50% in 1956 compared to 1955, exceeding normal needs. In order to support the textile industry and ensure the necessary supply of cotton cloth in the market, the supply of wadded cotton this year should be effectively compressed. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives is instructed to formulate a wadded cotton supply plan, earnestly compressing unreasonable supply quantities under the principle of practicing strict economy while ensuring the indispensable needs of the people. In some areas, if the wadded cotton supply targets are indeed insufficient, they should prepare to process and re-manufacture some old cotton as early as possible to make up for the insufficient supply of wadded cotton. At the same time, the people should be called upon to use wadded cotton sparingly.

Fourth, strengthen the leadership of cotton picking work and increase the amount of cotton purchased. At present, the growth of cotton is good. If the cotton picking work can be done well, it is possible to increase the cotton harvest, which in turn will increase the amount of cotton purchased. Last year, many areas implemented the experience of careful picking and harvesting, picking up dry cotton and selecting it cleanly, and separating picking, storage, drying, and sales, which not only increased production and purchase volume, but also improved the grade of cotton and increased the income of agricultural cooperatives and farmers. This year, all localities should pay attention to promoting these experiences. Purchasing personnel and cotton farmers should be educated to realize that no matter what grade of cotton, picking it and selling it to the state has a wide range of uses and is beneficial to both the state and the cotton farmers. The picking of low-grade cotton must not be underestimated, and all cotton must be picked up.

Fifth, in order to encourage cotton farmers to retain less and sell more, and to stabilize the cotton planting area, cotton farmers can be given preferential supply of five chi of cotton cloth outside the planned supply target for every hundred jin of ginned cotton sold. In addition, during the cotton purchase period, it is also necessary to do a good job in material supply and other economic work.

The CCP Central Committee and the State Council believe that in addition to doing a good job in the current cotton unified purchase work, all cotton-producing areas must also make good arrangements for next year's cotton production when arranging autumn sowing, so that the national cotton planting area will reach a level of 90 million mu in 1958.

### 中共中央和国务院  关于本年度棉花统购工作的指示

    中共中央和国务院
    关于本年度棉花统购工作的指示
    1956年9月到1957年8月这一个年度，由于棉田受灾和国家收购工作方面存在着缺点，国家收购棉花的数量减少，因此，严重地影响了棉布的供应。今年的棉田播种面积比上一年度少，但是今年的棉花大部分生长良好，今后如无重大的自然灾害，多收购一些棉花仍然是可能的。
    目前新棉已经开始上市，棉花统购工作，即将进入紧张阶段。各棉产区的党、政领导机关，必须立即对棉花统购工作做出专门的部署，教育棉农树立勤俭建国和勤俭持家的思想，多产多卖，少留节用，晒干拣净，多卖好棉给国家，批判部分棉农的多留少卖和企图高价在自由市场出售的资本主义思想，纠正某些干部的片面的“群众观点”和本位主义；必须抓紧棉花收购旺季的时机，拿出必要的时间，组织各方面力量，发动群众，全力投入棉花的采摘和收购工作，务必在短期内突击完成棉花的统购任务。
    为了顺利地完成棉花统购任务，要求各产棉区切实做好以下几项工作。
    第一、必须适当地减少农业社和农民的棉花留用量。据不少地方反映，实行以社为单位留棉的办法以后，农民留用的棉花总数比合作化以前增多了，而且农民每人留用三斤棉花在实际上也用不了，不少棉农因而把用不完的棉花拿到自由市场上出售，既影响国家掌握必需的棉花资源，也对市场的稳定起着不利的影响。因此，从今年起必须通过说服教育，本着少留多卖、留用次棉交售好棉的精神，对棉农留用量应当加以适当的压缩和控制。在一般情况下，每人只能留棉花二斤；少数集中产区如果压缩到二斤确有困难，可以少压缩一点，但是每人的留棉量不得超过二斤半；农业社公共需用的棉花，也包括在留用标准以内。在棉花产量还不够留用的分散产区，也应当通过协商方式争取收购一部分棉花。
    第二、加强对土纺土织和棉花、土布市场的管理。土纺土织与机器纺织比较，浪费棉花很多。一斤棉花用于土纺土织最多能织二十平方尺布，而用机器织布能织三十多平方尺，如果纺织高级布或者针织品相差就更多。几年来，国家为了照顾以土纺土织为主要生活来源的手工业者，为了照顾部分群众穿用土布的习惯，仍然对土纺土织采取了适当维持的方针，这是必要的。但是，有些地方的农业社为了发展副业生产，以致土纺土织发展过多，因而浪费了棉花，影响了棉花的收购和机织布的生产。因此，今后要说服农业社和棉农，一般不要进行以棉花做原料的副业生产。对于原来以土纺土织为主要生活来源的手工业户，应当由国营商业部门或者供销社有计划地安排土布的生产和收购。农民以自己留用棉花织出来的土布，出售时也必须卖给国家指定的商业部门。禁止棉花、土纱、土布进入自由市场，坚决执行国务院关于由国家计划收购（统购）和统一收购的农产品和其它物资不准进入自由市场的规定。
    第三、必须适当压缩絮棉供应。絮棉供应数量逐年都有增加，1955年比1954年增加了13.9％，1956年又比1955年增加了50％，超过了正常的需要。为了支持纺织工业，保证市场必需的棉布供应，今年的絮棉供应量应当切实压缩。责成全国供销合作总社，在厉行节约同时又保证人民必不可少的需要的原则下，认真压缩不合理的供应量，制订絮棉供应计划。有些地区，如果絮棉供应指标确实不够，应当及早准备加工再制一部分旧棉花，以弥补絮棉供应的不足。同时，要号召人民节约使用絮棉。
    第四、加强棉花采摘工作的领导，增加棉花的收购数量。目前棉花生长的情况是良好的，如果能够做好棉花的采摘工作，就有可能增加棉花的收获量，也就有可能增加棉花的收购量。去年不少地区实行细摘细收、拾干拣净，以及分摘、分存、分晒、分售的经验，不仅提高了生产量和收购量，同时，也提高了棉花的品级，增加了农业社和农民的收入。今年各地应当注意推广这些经验。应当教育采购人员和棉农认识到，不论什么等级的棉花，把它采摘下来卖给国家，都有广泛的用途，对国家和棉农都是有利的。绝不能轻视低级棉花的采摘，要把所有的棉花统统采摘起来。
    第五、为了鼓励棉农少留多卖，稳定棉花的播种面积，棉农每出售一百斤皮棉，可以在计划供应指标以外，优待供应棉布五尺。此外，在棉花收购期间，还必须做好物资供应工作和其它经济工作。
    中共中央、国务院认为，除了做好当前的棉花统购工作以外，各棉产区在安排秋季播种的时候，还必须很好地安排明年的棉花生产，使1958年全国的棉花播种面积达到九千万亩的水平。
