Glimpses

    The first underground hydroelectric power station in our country – the first-stage second-phase project of the Gutianxi Hydroelectric Power Station in Fujian Province – started construction ahead of schedule recently. Nearly two thousand workers who arrived at the site first are excavating the foundation of the dam, which is the largest and most critical project here. A large number of engineering materials, as well as various construction machines such as heavy-duty trucks, winches, air compressors, pneumatic drills, electric rock drills, and automatic concrete mixers, are being transported to the construction site from both land and water routes.

    Gutianxi is a tributary of the Minjiang River. The waterpower resources of this creek will be developed in three stages. When the entire project is completed, it will be able to generate more than one hundred thousand kilowatts.

    第一座地下水电站
    我国第一座地下水电站——福建省古田溪水电站第一级第二期工程提前在最近开工。最先到达工地的近两千名工人正在开挖这里最大的关键工程——拦河坝的坝基工程。大批工程材料，以及载重卡车、卷扬机、压风机、风钻机、电枪机和混凝土自动拌合机等各种施工机械，正从水陆两路源源运来工地。
    古田溪是闽江的一条支流。这条溪的水力资源，将分为三级开发；全部工程完成以后，能发电十几万瓩。
