This newspaper item reports that:

    Changchun, September 23rd. Over one hundred factories and mines in Jilin Province, involving over ten thousand workers, have recently launched a surge of airing their views. According to incomplete statistics, workers have offered over ten thousand opinions and posted two to three thousand big-character posters through forms such as big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, symposiums, and suggestion boxes. At the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, in just over ten days, workers raised nearly forty thousand opinions and posted over five thousand big-character posters, with more than 70% of the workers speaking out. At the Changchun Cigarette Factory, over one thousand two hundred employees raised nearly five thousand opinions, with over 90% of the workers speaking up, and the daily record of speeches reached as many as 100,000 words.

    Many leading cadres at all levels in various factories and mines have been able to listen humbly to the opinions of the masses and conscientiously improve shortcomings and errors. The director of the Changchun Cigarette Factory posted a big-character poster, expressing his acceptance of the workers' criticism and making a self-criticism. Rao Bin, director of the First Automobile Plant, often went to the workshops to read the big-character posters. After seeing the opinions raised by the workers, he would find the people who raised the opinions to carefully understand the situation in order to study solutions.

    In the previous period, the handling of opinions raised by employees in various units was relatively slow. This situation has now been reversed. Many units have put forward slogans of "Quick research, quick processing, quick implementation," and "Every item has an explanation, every item has a result." Of the five hundred and sixty opinions raised by employees of the state-owned Jilin Flour Mill, four hundred and thirty-four have now been resolved; explanations have also been given for those that cannot be resolved temporarily. Rao Bin, director of the First Automobile Plant, told the employees that he would strive to handle 80% of the problems that could be solved within the next week; and would explain the reasons to the workers for problems that could not be solved. A surge of improving work has now been formed throughout the plant.

    The leadership's timely determination and actions to improve work have powerfully stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm. On September 10th, the First Automobile Plant completed the first half of the month's automobile production plan ahead of schedule. Continuous eight-hour shift records appeared in various workshops of the Jilin Paper Mill, and more than fifty-eight tons of paper were overproduced in the first ten days of September. In August, the State-owned No. 8 Rubber Factory was short by over one thousand seven hundred pairs of shoes, but in the first half of September, in addition to making up for this shortage, it also overproduced more than four thousand pairs, and the number of first-class and second-class products increased, while the number of defective products decreased by more than 80%.

    吉林职工大鸣大放
    群众畅所欲言领导干部虚心听取
    本报长春23日电  吉林省一百多个厂矿企业的十几万职工，最近掀起了大鸣大放的热潮。据不完全统计，工人们通过大字报、黑板报、座谈会、意见箱等形式，提出十多万条意见，贴出二、三万张大字报。第一汽车制造厂在十多天中，工人们就提出了近四万条意见，贴出五千多张大字报，全厂70％以上的工人发了言。长春卷烟厂一千二百多名职工，提出了近五千条意见，全厂90％以上的工人说了话，每天的发言记录达到十万字之多。
    许多厂矿企业的各级领导干部，都能虚心听取群众的意见，认真改进缺点和错误。长春卷烟厂厂长贴出大字报，表示接受工人们的批评，并作了检讨。第一汽车厂厂长饶斌经常到车间去看大字报，当他看到工人给他提出的意见以后，便找提意见的人，细心地了解情况，以便研究解决。
    前一个时期，各单位对于职工提出的意见，处理得比较迟缓。目前这种情况已经扭转。许多单位提出了“快研究、快处理、快实行”、“条条有交代，条条有结果”的口号。国营吉林制粉厂职工提出的五百六十多条意见，现在已有四百三十四条得到解决；暂时不能解决的也都作了解释和说明。第一汽车厂厂长饶斌向职工表示，要争取在最近一周内，把能够解决的问题，处理到80％；对于不能解决的问题，也要向工人说清原因。目前全厂已经形成改进工作的热潮。
    领导上及时改进工作的决心和行动，有力地刺激了工人的生产热情。第一汽车厂在9月10日，就提前完成了上半月的汽车生产计划。吉林造纸厂各个车间连续出现了八小时不断头的记录，9月上旬超产了五十八吨多纸。国营第八橡胶厂8月份全厂欠产一千七百多双鞋，9月上半月除补上这一拖欠外，还超产四千多双，而且一、二等品增加，次品减少了80％以上。
