Slander Cannot Conceal the Crime of Aggression
By Our Staff Commentator

With Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly as the signal, the United States and its followers are launching a propaganda campaign to distort the truth about the Middle East situation and slander the Soviet Union and Syria, in order to shirk responsibility for the United States' actions of aggression against Syria and undermining peace in the Middle East.

On September 24, the United States, Britain, and France unanimously rejected the Soviet Union's proposal of September 3 that the four powers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration condemning the use of force in the Middle East and guaranteeing non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in the region. The United States, in its reply to the Soviet Union, insisted that the Soviet Union had distorted the United States' purposes and actions in the Middle East, and refused to acknowledge that the tense situation in the Middle East was the result of the United States' pursuit of a policy of aggression. In its reply, the United States repeated the oft-repeated platitude of the American propaganda machine, saying that the tense situation in the Middle East was due to the Soviet Union's sale of arms to Syria.

But the United States has not been able to explain why the Soviet Union's trade with Syria, which is not attached to any conditions, would cause tension in the Middle East. Syria has repeatedly stated that it is purchasing arms from the Soviet Union in order to prepare to resist aggression from Israel and imperialism. Syria had made requests to Western countries to purchase arms, but the Western countries put forward conditions that Syria could not accept. Why is the United States so unhappy that Syria is obtaining arms without any conditions attached in order to maintain its independence? Why is the United States so unhappy that the Soviet Union is selling arms to Syria without any conditions attached, so that the latter can resist aggression? The United States has not provided any answers to these questions.

In fact, the reason for the tension in the Middle East is not because Syria has strengthened its self-defense forces, but because Western countries, led by the United States, are stepping up the delivery of weapons to countries surrounding Syria and intend to use them to invade Syria. In order to create an excuse for this aggressive conspiracy, the United States insists that Syria's purchase of Soviet arms "threatens" its neighbors. Many signs indicate that the United States and its followers are vigorously promoting this fabricated argument in order to prepare public opinion for an invasion of Syria. This argument was put forward in the notes in which Britain and France rejected the Soviet proposal. On the same day, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, also slandering the Soviet Union's sale of arms to Syria as an attempt to turn Syria into a Soviet base. Turkish Prime Minister Menderes also made a great deal of slander against the Soviet Union and Syria on this issue.

It is very noteworthy that in the United States' reply to the Soviet Union, it made no mention of the Soviet Union's proposal, but at the same time declared in a threatening tone that "there should be no doubt that the United States government intends to implement" the "Eisenhower Doctrine" of aggression against the Middle East. Linking this statement by the U.S. government with the propaganda campaign launched by the United States shows that the United States is determined to continue its conspiracy to invade Syria, despite repeated warnings from the world's peace forces, led by the Soviet Union.

The American propaganda campaign to slander the Soviet Union and Syria is closely coordinated with its actual aggressive steps. On September 23, the so-called "Anti-Subversion Committee" of the Baghdad Pact, in which the United States participated, met in London to plot to overthrow the Syrian government. On September 24, Turkish Finance Minister Hasan Polatkan handed Turkish Prime Minister Menderes a note to Dulles, requesting more economic and military assistance from the United States. Polatkan also held consultations with U.S. Defense Secretary Wilson. At the same time, Turkey is stepping up the deployment of troops on the Syrian-Turkish border. According to Syrian newspapers, a large number of American troops have been stationed near Alexandretta (Iskenderun) on the Syrian-Turkish border. The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 23rd that from the 24th to the 28th, eight thousand U.S. Marines will conduct an amphibious "exercise" on the Thracian Peninsula in Turkey. At the same time, the United States is vigorously promoting the tension in Jordan and spreading rumors that so-called "smuggled weapons" have been found on the Syrian border.

Obviously, all these closely coordinated propaganda and actions are to prepare for aggression against Syria in terms of public opinion, military affairs, and subversion. However, the United States' tense aggressive activities also refuted its slander against the Soviet Union and Syria, proving that it is the United States, the thief crying "stop thief," that is creating tension in the Middle East and carrying out aggression.

The United States' slanderous propaganda and military threats cannot deceive or intimidate anyone. Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said on the 24th, "We are prepared to deal with any conspiracy that our enemies create secretly or openly, and we are ready to deal with any eventuality." He also said, "We have decided to sacrifice ourselves to defend our honor, independence, and freedom." It can be asserted that in the face of the Syrian government and people's heroic and fearless patriotism, all the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism will be defeated.

    诬蔑掩饰不了侵略罪行
    本报评论员
    以杜勒斯在联合国大会上的演说作为信号，美国和它的追随者正在发动一个歪曲中东局势真相、诬蔑苏联和叙利亚的宣传运动，以便为美国侵略叙利亚、破坏中东和平的行动推卸责任。
    9月24日，美、英、法三国一致拒绝了苏联在9月3日提出的建议，即由美、英、法、苏四国发表共同宣言，谴责在中东使用武力，并保证不干涉这个地区国家的内政。美国向苏联提出的复照，硬说苏联歪曲了美国在中东的目的和行动，不承认中东的紧张局势是美国推行侵略政策的结果。美国在复照中重弹了美国宣传机器唱之已久的滥调，说什么中东局势之所以紧张，是由于苏联出售军火给叙利亚的缘故。
    但是美国并没有能够说明，为什么苏联同叙利亚之间不附有任何条件的贸易竟然会引起中东局势的紧张。叙利亚已经一再表明，它之所以向苏联购买军火，是为了准备抵抗以色列和帝国主义的侵略。叙利亚曾经向西方国家提出购买军火的要求，但是西方国家却提出了叙利亚所不能接受的条件。为什么美国这样不喜欢叙利亚获得不附有任何条件的军火来维护它的独立呢？为什么美国这样不喜欢苏联不附有任何条件地出售军火给叙利亚，使后者能够抵抗侵略呢？对于这些问题，美国没有作出任何答复。
    事实上，中东局势之所以紧张，并不是因为叙利亚加强了自卫的力量，而是因为以美国为首的西方国家正在加紧运送武器给叙利亚周围的国家，并且打算利用它们来侵略叙利亚。为了给这个侵略阴谋制造借口，美国硬说叙利亚购买了苏联的军火就“威胁”了它的邻国。许多迹象表明，美国和它的追随者正是在大肆宣传这个无中生有的论调，来为侵略叙利亚作好舆论准备。在英、法拒绝苏联建议的照会中，就发表了这样的论调。同一天，英国外交大臣劳埃德在联合国大会中发表演说，又诬蔑苏联出售军火给叙利亚是打算把叙利亚变成苏联的基地。土耳其总理曼德列斯也在这个问题上对苏联和叙利亚大肆诬蔑。
    十分值得注意的是，在美国给苏联的复照中，对于苏联的建议绝口不提，同时却以威胁的口气宣称，“应该毫不怀疑美国政府打算实现”侵略中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”。把美国政府的这个声明同美国发动的宣传运动联系起来，就可以看出美国决心不顾以苏联为首的世界和平力量的一再警告，继续进行侵略叙利亚的阴谋活动。
    美国这个诬蔑苏联和叙利亚的宣传运动，是同它的实际侵略步骤密切配合着的。9月23日，有美国参加的巴格达集团的所谓“反颠复委员会”在伦敦开会，策划推翻叙利亚政府的阴谋。9月24日，土耳其财政部长哈桑·波拉特干将土耳其总理曼德列斯一份照会交给杜勒斯，要求美国给予更多的经济和军事援助。波拉特干还同美国国防部长威尔逊进行了磋商。同时，土耳其正加紧在叙、土边境调集军队。据叙利亚报纸报道，已经有大量美国军队进驻叙、土边境上的亚历山大勒达（伊斯肯德伦）附近。美国国防部在23日宣布，从24日到28日，八千名美国海军陆战队人员将在土耳其的色雷斯半岛进行两栖进攻的“演习”。同时，美国竭力宣传约旦局势紧张，并且造谣说在叙利亚边界上发现了所谓“走私的武器”。
    很明显，所有这一切互相密切配合的宣传和行动，都是为了给侵略叙利亚作好舆论上、军事上和颠复活动方面的准备。然而，美国这种紧张的侵略活动，也正好驳倒了它对苏联和叙利亚的诬蔑，证明在中东制造紧张局势、进行侵略的不是别人，正是作贼喊贼的美国。
    美国这种诬蔑宣传和军事威胁欺骗不了也恫吓不倒任何人。叙利亚总理阿萨利在24日说，“我们准备对付我们的敌人秘密地或者公开地制造的任何阴谋，我们已经准备好对付任何事件。”他还说，“我们已经决定为了保卫我们的荣誉、独立和自由而牺牲。”可以肯定，在叙利亚政府和人民这种英勇无畏的爱国主义精神面前，美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计必将失败。
