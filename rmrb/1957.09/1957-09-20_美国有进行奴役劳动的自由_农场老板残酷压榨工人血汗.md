　　The United States Has the Freedom to Engage in Slave Labor
    Farm Owners Ruthlessly Exploit Workers' Sweat and Blood

    This newspaper reports that the American "Daily Worker" on August 30, September 2, and 3, consecutively published shocking information about large farm owners in New York State luring workers into slave labor.

    During the harvest season, large farm owners habitually use beautiful promises such as high wages and good working and living conditions to lure black people from the South or people from Puerto Rico to sign contracts to work on farms, either alone or with their entire families. After arriving at the farms, these workers discover they have been deceived, but by then they are unable to escape the cruel exploitation.

    The so-called good living conditions are nothing more than living in concentration camp-like conditions, crammed into simple shacks under guard. Take the "labor camp" of Cutchogue on Long Island as an example. It is surrounded by a six-foot-high wire fence, with a "No Visitors" sign at the gate, and armed guards. The "labor camp" is filthy and extremely crowded. In a labor camp called "Shack Light," a large shack of seventy or eighty square meters houses seventy-five single workers.

    As for labor conditions and wages, they are purely a deception. Brunson, a young black man who once worked on the farm of Sheriff Frank of Oswego County, said that although it was said to be a forty-hour work week, they actually worked as many as seventy-two hours a week, and the wages were very low. They were monitored on the farm like prisoners. Frank came to the farm every day, carrying a gun, and "the workers were careful not to complain to him about the farm conditions." Brunson also saw black people who wanted to leave the "labor camp" being beaten.

    Farm owners squeeze as much sweat and blood as possible from each worker, while also trying various methods to deduct from their already meager wages. The owners do not pay workers in cash, stipulating that they must purchase goods on credit at the farm's store, which are deducted from their wages, and the prices of the goods are outrageously expensive. Workers have to pay high fees to see a doctor, and even have to pay "transportation fees" to ride to the fields to work. The owners also deduct so-called "union dues" from the workers' wages, but in reality, the workers have never received a union membership card and have never seen any union representatives.

    Hill, the labor secretary of the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People," investigated the situation of black people in several counties in New York State and said: "Many black families worked for weeks, but the foreman either told them they didn't earn much money, or said that after deducting the food bills purchased on credit from the store, accommodation fees, and transportation fees, they were now in debt." "If black people want to leave the labor camp, the contractor will say they owe money and will not allow them to leave. Violence and intimidation are often used to prevent workers and their families from leaving."

### 美国有进行奴役劳动的自由  农场老板残酷压榨工人血汗

　　美国有进行奴役劳动的自由
    农场老板残酷压榨工人血汗
    本报讯　8月30日、9月2日和3日的美国“工人日报”，连续发表了纽约州大农场老板诱骗工人进行奴役劳动的惊人情况。
    在收获季节，大农场老板照例用工资高、工作和居住条件好等漂亮诺言，诱骗南方黑人或波多黎各人签订合同，单身或全家到农场工作。到了农场之后，这些工人才发现受骗，但是那时他们已无法逃脱残酷的剥削。
    所谓良好的居住条件，不过是像住集中营一样，挤在被看守起来的简陋的窝棚里。以长岛的卡错克的“劳工营”为例，它四周围着六英尺高的铁丝网，门口挂着“禁止参观”牌子，还有武装警卫。“劳工营”里污秽不堪，十分拥挤。在一个叫“沙克·莱特”的劳工营里，一间七、八十平方米的大窝棚，住了七十五个单身工人。
    说到劳动条件和工资待遇，更是纯粹的骗局。曾经在奥斯维克郡警察局长弗兰克的农场工作过的黑人青年布伦逊说，虽然说的是四十小时工作，他们每周工作实际上竟达七十二小时，而且工资很少。他们在农场上就像囚犯一样受到监视。弗兰克每天都到农场，身上带着枪，“工人都小心翼翼不敢向他抱怨农场条件。”布伦逊还看见想离开“劳工营”的黑人被殴打。
    农场老板从每一个工人身上榨出尽可能多的血汗，同时又想各种办法，克扣他们本来就微薄的工资。老板不发给工人现款，规定他们必须在农场开设的商店赊购物品，从工资中扣除，而物品的价格昂贵得惊人。工人看病要收高额的钱，上地里去劳动时坐车还要付“交通费”。老板还要从工人工资中扣除所谓“工会费”，实际上工人从来没有拿过工会会员证，也没有见过什么工会代表。
      “全国有色人种协进会”劳工秘书希尔调查了纽约州几个郡的黑人情况说：“许多黑人全家劳动了几个星期，但是工头不是告诉他们没有赚到多少钱，就说扣除商店赊购食品账、住宿费和交通费以后，现在他们负了债。”“如果黑人想离开劳工营，包工头就说他们欠了钱，不许离开。为了阻止工人和他的家庭离开，经常采取暴力和恫吓手段”。
