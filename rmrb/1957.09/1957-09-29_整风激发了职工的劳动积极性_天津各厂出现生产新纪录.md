Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 28th: The rectification movement has further promoted the socialist competition launched by Tianjin factory workers to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan and welcome National Day.

This competition among Tianjin workers began in late August. State-owned and local industrial systems have revised their original production increase and savings plans, raising the annual production increase and savings plan from 225 million yuan to 350 million yuan. Shortly after the start of the competition, a rectification movement was launched throughout the city. The vast number of workers opened their hearts and felt particularly refreshed, which boosted their production enthusiasm even more. After the start of the rectification, the workers of No. 2 machine at Tianjin Paper Mill raised the key issue of increasing production—reducing production downtime. In the past, the downtime per shift was 10 to 30 minutes, but now they proposed to reduce it to 10 minutes (Note: 26 kilograms of paper can be produced per minute). After the target was put forward, the first shift created a new record of 9 minutes and 2 seconds. Immediately afterwards, the second and third shifts successively created records of 8 minutes and 7 minutes, with each shift surpassing the previous one.

In order to achieve the goal of "rectification and production going hand in hand," workers proposed measures and guarantees for increasing production and practicing economy, launched various forms of competition activities, and broke through old production quotas. Since September, workers in the steelmaking department of Tianjin Steel Plant have been trying to shorten the smelting time of each furnace of steel, and in the first half of the month, they produced 360 tons more steel ingots and saved 50 tons of raw materials.

    整风激发了职工的劳动积极性
    天津各厂出现生产新纪录
    据新华社天津28日电　整风运动进一步推动了天津市工厂职工为超额完成第一个五年计划、为迎接国庆而展开的社会主义竞赛。
    天津市职工的这次竞赛是在8月下旬开始的。国营工业和地方工业系统都分别修订了原来的增产节约计划，把全年增产节约二亿二千五百万元的计划提高到三亿五千万元。竞赛开始不久，全市又展开了整风运动。广大职工都把心里话敞开了，格外感到心情舒畅，因而生产热情更加高涨。天津造纸总厂二号机工人在整风开始以后，就提出了解决增产的关键问题——缩短生产中断时间。过去每班中断时间是十到三十分钟，现在提出争取降到十分钟（按：每分钟可产纸二十六公斤）。指标提出以后，第一班就创造了九分零二秒的新纪录。紧接着，第二班、第三班又相继创造了八分、七分钟的纪录，一班赛过一班。
    工人们为了实现整风生产两不误，都提出增产节约措施和保证条件，展开多种多样的竞赛活动，突破了旧的生产定额。天津钢厂炼钢部工人9月份以来想办法把每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短，在上半月就多增产了三百六十吨钢锭，还节约了五十吨原料。
