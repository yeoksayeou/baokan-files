Hailun County's First Batch of Agricultural Cooperative Great Debates Ends
Farmers' Awareness Improves and They Actively Sell Surplus Grain

(Our dispatch) According to the Heilongjiang Daily news: The first batch of eighty-four agricultural production cooperatives in Hailun County has concluded its great debate centered on the grain issue. During the debate, more than 80% of male and female cooperative members received socialist education, greatly enhancing their socialist consciousness.

Through this great debate, the broad masses of farmers have further realized the great significance of the unified purchase and sale of grain. They said that in order to live a happier life, they must sell some grain to support the country's socialist construction. Before launching the socialist great debate, the Tongxin Township Central Cooperative had already overfulfilled the task of purchasing wheat. After the socialist great debate, members improved their socialist awareness and, in the spirit of having enough to eat and voluntarily leaving less, sold an additional 10,000 jin of wheat to the state. The Minzhu Cooperative in Qianjin Township planted 110 hectares of wheat this year and originally planned to keep more wheat seeds and wheat for people to eat; after the great debate, they realized that it was wrong to only care about individuals and disregard the country, and decided to sell as much grain as possible.

    海伦县第一批农业社大辩论结束
    农民觉悟提高积极卖余粮
    本报讯　据黑龙江日报消息：海伦县第一批八十四个农业生产合作社已经结束了以粮食问题为中心的大辩论。在辩论的过程中，有80％以上的男女社员受到了社会主义教育，大大地提高了社会主义觉悟。
    经过这场大辩论，广大农民进一步认识到粮食统购统销的重大意义。他们说，为了过更幸福的生活，就要卖一些粮，支援国家社会主义建设。同心乡中心社在开展社会主义大辩论以前，已经超额完成了征购小麦任务，经过社会主义大辩论以后，社员们提高了社会主义觉悟，本着够吃和自愿少留的精神，又多卖给国家一万斤小麦。前进乡民主社今年种一百一十公顷小麦，原来打算多留些麦种和人吃的麦子；经过大辩论，认识到了光顾个人不顾国家是不对的，决定尽量多卖粮。
