    Eight Months of Overproduction: More Than Two Thousand Tons of Coal
    Fengfeng Mining Bureau Completes Annual Production Increase Plan

    (Our Newspaper dispatch) The five coal mines under the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, as of the end of August, had overproduced 2,103 tons of coal, completing the annual task of increasing raw coal production by 150,000 tons four months ahead of schedule. The ash content of raw coal was also reduced by 3.6% compared to the national plan. More than 3,600 cubic meters of pit props were saved. According to preliminary calculations, in the next four months, another 30,000 tons of raw coal can be produced for the country, saving 3,500 cubic meters of pit props.

    In the production increase and economy campaign, the mines under the Fengfeng Mining Bureau widely promoted more than ten key advanced experiences, such as regular cycle operations, blasting and loading coal, heavy-duty chutes, layered heading and separate roadway support, and single-heading excavation. They strengthened cycle management and coal car dispatching. At the same time, pit prop substitutes were widely used.

    八个月超产两千多吨煤
    峰峰矿务局完成全年增产计划
    本报讯　峰峰矿务局所属五个煤矿，截至8月底止，超额生产了两千一百零三吨煤，提前四个月完成了全年增产十五万吨原煤的任务。原煤灰分也比国家计划降低3.6％。节约的坑木有三千六百多立方。据初步计算，今后四个月可以再为国家增产原煤三万吨，节约坑木三千五百立方。
    峰峰矿务局所属各矿，在增产节约运动中广泛地推广了正规循环作业、放炮装煤、重型溜子和分层送道、独头掘进等十多种关键性的先进经验，加强了循环管理和煤车调度工作。同时广泛利用了坑木代用品。
