    (Combined News Report) According to Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, September 10: The “Holy War” newspaper, the official newspaper of the “Algerian National Liberation Front,” published a statement on September 5, stating that the Algerian people will continue to fight until they achieve complete independence.
    The "Holy War" newspaper pointed out that Algeria is breaking free from the clutches of France. Although France is trying to formulate so-called reform plans and new regulations in order to maintain its old colony, these efforts are already too late and futile. The Algerian nation has regained its freedom and is firmly moving towards independence.
    The "Holy War" newspaper also published the battle report of the Algerian National Liberation Army from August 11 to 25. The battle report mentioned many battles fought in six regions. In fourteen days of fighting, 2,049 French soldiers were killed, 1,425 were wounded, and a large number of vehicles and weapons were captured.
    At the same time, the Algerian National Liberation Army has been very active in various places in the past few days. Fifty-five and eighty miles southeast of Algiers, the National Liberation Army ambushed French colonial army units twice in succession. A total of 22 French soldiers were killed.
    National Liberation Army units also attacked a series of French outposts in many regions of Algeria. A French military vehicle was also destroyed by a mine near Orléansville. Three French soldiers were killed.

　　民族解放阵线机关报发表声明
　　阿尔及利亚人民决斗争到底
　　民族解放军在各地痛击法殖民军
    本报综合报道　据新华社10日讯：阿尔及尔消息：9月5日出版的“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”机关报“圣战报”发表声明说，阿尔及利亚人民将继续斗争，直到获得完全的独立为止。
    “圣战报”指出，阿尔及利亚正在从法国的魔掌中挣脱出来。尽管法国试图制订所谓改革方案和新法规，以便保持它的旧有的殖民地，但是这些努力已经是为时过晚和枉费心机了。阿尔及利亚民族已经重新获得了它的自由，并且坚定地向独立前进。
    “圣战报”还公布了阿尔及利亚民族解放军8月11日至25日的战报。战报提到了在六个地区所进行的许多次战斗。在十四天的战斗中，击毙法军二千零四十九人，击伤一千四百二十五人，并且缴获了大量的车辆和武器。
    同时，过去几天中，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在各地十分活跃。在阿尔及尔市东南五十五英里和八十英里处，民族解放军先后两度对法国殖民军部队进行伏击。法军一共被击毙二十二人。
    民族解放军部队还在阿尔及利亚全国许多地区内袭击了一系列的法国岗哨。法国军车一辆也在奥尔良斯维尔市附近触雷炸毁。法军三人毙命。
