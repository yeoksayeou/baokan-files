Moscow, September 18th (Reported by our newspaper) Since collectivization, and especially in recent years since adopting a policy of further great development from 1953, Soviet agriculture has achieved brilliant success.

Last year, the total sown area in the Soviet Union was 194.7 million hectares, an increase of 76.5 million hectares compared to 1913. Total agricultural output increased by 1.7 times, mainly due to collectivization and mechanization. Compared to 1953, the sown area increased by 37.5 million hectares, and total wheat output increased by 63%, mainly due to land reclamation. Before the revolution, the rural population was the majority, but now the urban population is the majority. However, the area of cultivated land and the harvest have greatly increased.

Last year, Soviet collective farms and state farms delivered 3.3 billion poods of marketable grain to the state, in addition to what they retained for their own use. In the same year, the Soviet urban population was approximately 120 million. Averaging this out, each urban resident could receive 450 kilograms of grain.

The Soviet Union now ranks first in the world in terms of grain sown area and wheat production. Last year, the Soviet Union's grain sown area reached 128.3 million hectares, which is more than the total sown area of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and West Germany combined. In the past three years, Soviet wheat production has grown rapidly, while wheat production in these six major capitalist countries has decreased by 12% to 15%. The Soviet Union also ranks first in the world in the production of cotton, flax, and sugar beets. Last year, the Soviet Union's average yield of raw cotton per hectare was 2,160 kilograms, while capitalist countries only yielded 750 kilograms, including the United States with 1,350 kilograms.

The Soviet livestock industry suffered huge losses during the war, but last year, livestock products still increased by about one time compared to the pre-revolutionary era. Last year, there were 70.4 million head of cattle, an increase of 12 million head compared to 1916; 56.65 million head of pigs, an increase of 33.5 million head compared to 1916; and 145.7 million head of sheep, an increase of 49.4 million head compared to 1916. Last year, collective farms produced 17.5 million tons of milk, an increase of 8.3 million tons compared to 1953; and supplied approximately 9 million pigs to meat processing plants.

With the development of socialist agricultural productivity, the economic situation of collective farms and their members is constantly improving. In 1932, just after collectivization was completed, the total cash income of collective farms throughout the Soviet Union was 4.6 billion rubles, and the reserve fund was 4.7 billion rubles. Last year, the cash income was 94.5 billion rubles, and the reserve fund was 98.9 billion rubles. The average cash income of each collective farm increased from 22,000 rubles in 1932 to 1,143,000 rubles last year.

Collective ownership, especially the recent increases in agricultural production and the state's increase in the prices for procurement and requisition of agricultural products, has brought about a thriving life for collective farmers. Last year, 67% of collective farms adopted the method of paying labor day remuneration in advance on a monthly or quarterly basis. The cash and in-kind income of each able-bodied farmer increased by 68% last year compared to 1950, and by 3.4 times compared to 1913. Before the revolution, the taxes paid by laboring peasants accounted for about 20% of their agricultural income. Now, the taxes paid by collective farmers are less than 4% of their agricultural income. The state's expenditures on culture, health, pensions, etc., for each able-bodied collective farmer were 38 times higher last year than in 1913.

The most telling indicator of the lives of collective farmers is the improvement in their clothing, food, housing, and cultural level. According to a survey by the Soviet Central Statistical Bureau, the industrial products purchased by farm households last year, calculated per capita, were 2.1 times the amount in 1940. The non-staple foods eaten by collective farm members' families, calculated per capita, were 163% of the amount in 1940 for meat and fats, 244% for fish and fish products, 148% for milk and dairy products, 210% for eggs, and 4.4 times for sugar. From 1950 to 1955, 2.3 million houses were built in collective farms, and 4 million will be built from 1956 to 1960. Before the revolution, the illiteracy rate for people over the age of nine was 76%, and the proportion of illiteracy among peasants was even higher. Now, not only urban residents but also rural residents have generally received seven years of compulsory education, and many farms have their own clubs.

### 几年来采取了进一步大发展的方针　苏联农业成就辉煌　总产量较帝俄时代增加一点七倍

　　几年来采取了进一步大发展的方针
　　苏联农业成就辉煌
　　总产量较帝俄时代增加一点七倍
    本报莫斯科18日电　苏联农业在集体化以来，尤其是从1953年采取进一步大发展方针的最近几年中，取得了辉煌的成就。
    全苏播种面积去年为一亿九千四百七十万公顷，比1913年增加七千六百五十万公顷，农业总产量增加一点七倍，这主要是由于集体化和机械化。如同1953年相比，则播种面积增加三千七百五十万公顷，小麦总产量增加63％，这主要由于开荒。革命前农村人口占大多数，现在城市人口占多数，但现在耕地面积和收获量反而大大增加了。
    苏联集体农庄和国营农场除了自用以外，去年交给国家三十三亿普特商品谷物。同年苏联城市人口约一亿二千万。以此平均，每个城市居民可得到四百五十公斤谷物。
    苏联现在谷物播种面积和小麦产量都占世界第一位。去年苏联谷物播种面积达一亿二千八百三十万公顷，比美国、加拿大、英国、法国、意大利、西德六国播种面积的总和还多。过去三年，苏联小麦产量飞跃增长，而这六个主要资本主义国家的小麦产量却降低了12％到15％。苏联在棉花、亚麻和甜菜的产量上都占世界第一位。去年苏联每公顷平均收原棉二千一百六十公斤，而资本主义国家才收七百五十公斤，其中美国收一千三百五十公斤。
    苏联饲畜业在战时损失巨大，但去年畜产品仍比革命前增加约一倍。去年有牛七千零四十万头，比1916年增加一千二百万头；有猪五千六百五十万头，比1916年增加三千三百五十万头；有羊一亿四千五百七十万头，比1916年增加四千九百四十万头。集体农庄去年产一千七百五十万吨牛乳，比1953年增产八百三十万吨；去年供应肉类加工厂约九百万头猪。
    随着社会主义农业生产力的发展，集体农庄和庄员的经济情况不断改善。全苏集体农庄在才完成集体化后的1932年现金收入为四十六亿卢布，公积金为四十七亿卢布，去年现金收入为九百四十五亿卢布，公积金为九百八十九亿卢布。平均每个集体农庄的现金收入由1932年的二万二千卢布增加到去年的一百十四万三千卢布。
    集体所有制，特别是最近几年农业增产和国家对于农产品采购和征购的价格的提高，使集体农民生活蒸蒸日上。去年有67％集体农庄采取了按月按季预付劳动日报酬的办法。每个有劳动力的庄员的现金和实物收入在去年比1950年增加68％，比1913年增加三点四倍。革命前，劳动农民所交的捐税约占他们的农业收入的20％，现在集体农民所付的税额不及他们的农业收入的4％。国家用在每个有劳动力的集体农民身上的文化、卫生、抚恤等等费用，去年为1913年的三十八倍。
    最足以说明集体农民生活的，是他们衣食住和文化水平的上升。据苏联中央统计局调查，去年农户购买的工业品，按人口平均计算，布匹为1940年的二点一倍。集体农庄庄员家庭中吃的副食，按人口平均计算，肉和脂肪为1940年的163％，鱼和鱼制品为244％，牛乳和乳制品为148％，鸡蛋为210％，糖为四点四倍。在1950年到1955年在集体农庄盖了二百三十万栋住房，在1956年到1960年将建四百万栋。革命前，九岁以上的文盲占76％，在农民中文盲的比例更大。现在不但城市居民而且乡村的居民都普遍受到了七年制义务教育，许多农庄有自己的俱乐部。
