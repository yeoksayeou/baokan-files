    An Important Way to Increase Oilseed Production
    Try to Reclaim and Restore Oil-Tea and Other Woody Oil Plants
    ·State Council Approves and Transmits Joint Report from the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and Other Departments·
    (Our Newspaper News) The State Council recently approved and transmitted a joint report from the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Food Industry on reclaiming and developing oil-tea and other woody oil plants.
    Oil-tea is one of China's major woody oil crops, mainly produced in the mountainous and hilly areas of eleven southern provinces, including Hunan. At present, the country has approximately 27 million mu of oil-tea area, of which more than 7 million mu are abandoned forests. In recent years, the annual output of tea oil has been around 80,000 to 100,000 tons.
    The report pointed out that in order to fully and rationally utilize woody oil resources, we should first start with reclaiming abandoned forests and strengthen the cultivation and management of existing productive forests and young forests to increase yield per unit area. The return time for woody oil plants is relatively slow, but the economic effect is significant. Generally, reclaiming abandoned forests can increase the production of oil-tea seeds by about ten jin per mu in the third year, which can be used to extract tea oil. The state should provide necessary economic support to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for reclamation, cultivation, and management. The report also proposed that local governments should strengthen leadership and planning for woody oil plants. Cooperatives should make unified plans for the grain production, economic forests, and timber forest reclamation and development of mountainous areas based on suitable forest land and labor force. In key oil forest producing areas, efforts should be made to comprehensively reclaim existing abandoned oil-tea forests within the next two years. Secondly, the issue of incorporating woody oil-tea forests into cooperatives should be properly handled, ensuring reasonable assessment of production and pricing. When arranging grain production in mountainous areas, it should be considered in conjunction with the production of woody oil plants, taking both into overall consideration; appropriate consideration should be given to the amount of grain retained and supplied.
    The report also made explanations on issues such as tea oil prices, national loans, and technical guidance for production.
    The Ministry of Forestry plans to convene a woody oil plant meeting in September to further study the long-term plan for oil-tea and the restoration and development of other woody oil plants, and to propose specific plans.

    增产油料的重要门路
    油茶等木本油料要尽量垦复
    ·国务院批转林业、农业等部联合报告·
    本报讯　国务院最近批转了林业部、农业部、粮食部、食品工业部关于垦复和发展油茶等木本油料的联合报告。
    油茶是我国大宗的木本油料之一，主要产区在湖南等南方十一省的山区和丘陵地区。目前全国约共有油茶面积二千七百万亩，其中有荒芜林七百多万亩。近年来，茶油的常年产量在八至十万吨左右。
    报告指出，为了充分合理地利用木本油料资源，首先应从垦复荒芜林着手，并加强对现有收益林及幼林培修抚育，以提高单位面积产量。木本油料的收益时间较慢，但经济效果大，垦复荒林一般到第三年每亩增产的油茶籽约可榨茶油十斤左右。国家应给以必要的经济扶植，鼓励农民垦复、抚育管理的积极性。报告中还提出，各地政府要加强对木本油料的领导和规划。合作社应根据宜林地带、劳动力多寡等条件，对山地的粮食生产、经济林与用材林的垦复和发展作统一的规划。在油林的重点产区，要求在今、明两年内争取将现有荒芜油茶林进行全面垦复；其次要妥善处理木本油茶林的入社问题，做到评产和作价合理。对山区布置粮食生产的时候，应当与木本油料的生产结合考虑，统筹兼顾；在粮食的留量和供应量上加以适当照顾。
    对茶油的价格、国家贷款、生产技术指导等问题，报告中也作了说明。
    林业部计划于9月份召开木本油料会议，对油茶的长远规划及其它木本油料的恢复和发展问题进一步研究，并提出具体方案。
