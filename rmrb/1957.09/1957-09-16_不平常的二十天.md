The Unusual Twenty Days
By our reporter Guo Longchun

Large-Character Posters Posted One After Another

Comrade Yuan Deshun, the branch secretary of the machine repair section and mechanical technician and section chief of the coking department at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, has been feeling uneasy these past few days.

On the second day of the plant's mobilization for vigorous airing of views, the coking department's employees posted fifty-three large-character posters, of which seven or eight directly criticized the machine repair work. In the following four days, this type of large-character poster increased to more than twenty. Some criticized the workshop for not repairing the coking equipment in a timely manner; some criticized the workshop leaders for not responding to the employees' requests to repair safety equipment for a long time; and some simply criticized by name.

"The track for the reversing furnace top charging car is not straight, and the furnace door machine is not easy to use. I have mentioned it to the leaders several times, but it has not been repaired until now. Why has the old problem not been solved?"

"The No. 1 furnace conveyor belt is so heavy that it cannot be pushed, the track is uneven, and a clip has to be changed every shift, and the belt is torn. May I ask Yuan Deshun, why can't your work be carried out well?" Some people wrote large-character posters titled "Exposing Yuan Deshun's Bureaucratism," saying:

"During the 'May Day' holiday, the imperfect conveyor belt was pushed onto the furnace platform... The rollers, protective plates, etc., are broken and not repaired... You should seriously examine your bureaucratic style!" The "Airing Views Garden," composed of billboards and wooden boards and reed mats, was filled with colorful large-character posters. People reading the large-character posters jostled each other. Such open and sharp criticism had never happened before.

"Why do everyone have so many opinions about me?!" Yuan Deshun, who usually works diligently, was standing in the crowd looking at these large-character posters. At first, he felt a little heavy-hearted.

Later, after thinking carefully, "Isn't this exactly the enthusiastic performance of the masses in helping the Party rectify its work style? The opinions raised by everyone also make me see the shortcomings in my work more clearly!"

What should I do? The "rectify while correcting" instruction repeatedly emphasized by the Party committee is the guide for action.

While asking others to help copy the large-character posters, Yuan Deshun was determined to immediately improve his work.

Plugging Loopholes, Digging Out Root Causes

On the eighth day of the vigorous airing of views, the coking department's general Party branch systematically studied the opinions raised by the employees and specifically arranged to immediately solve the problems that could be solved immediately.

Before this, Comrade Yuan Deshun, together with Comrade Li Ziming, the equipment director, and others, led the employees of the machine repair section to improve several tasks and satisfy some of the production workers' demands.

The women's bathhouse was built last year, but the water pipes were not connected and could not be used. The female workers had to go back to the dormitory with their bodies covered in coal dust and coke powder to take a bath and change clothes after work, and they had a lot of complaints. In the past, the coking department's machine repair section and the factory's welfare department pushed each other, and neither came to solve the problem. This time, after the female workers posted large-character posters, Yuan Deshun and the comrades in the machine repair section took the initiative to connect the water pipes on the third day. Now, the girls can take a clean bath after work and then return to the dormitory relaxed and happy.

The coke oven pushing machine was difficult to push because the oil box was broken. The employees had raised their opinions in the past but it was not repaired. After the workers posted large-character posters criticizing it this time, Comrade Yuan Deshun and the machine repair workers went to repair it on the 27th of last month.

In the first twenty days since the start of the airing of views, they solved fifteen problems, another four were being solved, and ten were included in the recent work plan. The equipment problems raised in the previous three large-character posters have also been repaired or initially repaired.

During this period, Yuan Deshun actively solved the problems raised by the employees, plugging the loopholes in the current work; on the other hand, he was also examining his ideological style and looking for ways to fundamentally overcome the shortcomings.

Yuan Deshun was an apprentice at the age of seventeen, and came to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant at the age of twenty-one. He did hard work for twelve years under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Japanese puppets. In 1952, he became a foreman; in the same year, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. In 1953, he was promoted to mechanical technician of the coking department. Since liberation, under the cultivation and education of the Party, his class consciousness has been greatly improved; however, he has not deeply understood the working methods of the Party's mass line since he took on leadership work.

When he was talking to reporters about his experience in the rectification movement, he said: "In the past, my work was not in-depth and I did not pay enough attention to the opinions of the masses. Some problems were not difficult to solve, but they were not solved in time because I did not pay attention to them ideologically. In fact, some equipment defects may seem like small problems to us, but for production workers, they are directly related to their safety and the quality of their labor conditions. In the future, I will go deep into the masses, care about the hardships of the employees, and solve the problems in production in a timely manner."

In the past, workers criticized them for often using plans as a shield. When they asked to repair something, it was often "not included in the plan," "no materials were prepared," or "too busy." Now, the flames of the large-character posters have burned away the ideological style of being divorced from the masses, and the remaining planning problems have been solved smoothly. In the past, the monthly plan was discussed in the workshop, and the weekly plan was arranged by themselves. Now, the weekly plan is also supplemented and revised in a timely manner based on the opinions of the employees. As for the clich√©s such as "no plan" and "too busy," no one hangs them on their lips anymore.

In the past, Comrade Yuan Deshun did not go down to the grassroots level too often, and sometimes the production workers would not see his face for a day or two; now, on the coking furnace, Yuan Deshun can be seen bending over to inspect the machinery every day, or standing with the workers, studying how to improve the equipment. Sometimes, in the fiery light of the coke oven at night, his figure can also be seen.

A Common New Starting Point

On September 13, all the workers of the reversing furnace sent a congratulatory letter to the machine repair section in a big red envelope. The letter said:

"Respected leaders of the machine repair section and all worker comrades: ...After the Party committee report on August 23, from the next day you took the initiative to repair the turntable, small railway, furnace door machine, coke quenching water pipes, etc. of our small furnace, ensuring the safe production of the small furnace. The turntable of the original small furnace No. 2 row often derailed. After you repaired it, there have been no derailment accidents for twenty days. This is enough to prove that through the study of the rectification movement, you have improved your work enthusiasm and achieved rectification while correcting... We are willing to continue to learn from each other and make progress together in the rectification movement!"

People who understand the ideological situation of the employees know that it is not a simple matter for production workers to write a letter praising Yuan Deshun and the section he leads.

In the past, many production workers were a little lazy to raise their opinions on improving the equipment. They said: Anyway, the leaders are just "sending an umbrella after it rains" and "closing the door after the thief has left." They don't respond to opinions in advance, and when an accident occurs, the director and the technician all come down! Even at the beginning of the rectification movement, some workers were still skeptical about whether the problems could be solved if they raised their opinions.

Now, when I visited the workers in the coking department, many people said at the beginning: "The rectification movement is really effective!" "Now the leaders are very different, and the transformation of the mechanical technicians is very obvious!" Some people then said: The workers have now said what is in their hearts, and the leaders are immediately solving the problems that can be solved now. Everyone feels comfortable and the enthusiasm for production is even greater!

The facts are also true. Take the reversing furnace as an example. This unit was just established in March of this year, and the previous production situation has not been good. During the rectification movement, more than 160 of them posted 90 large-character posters. Many people spoke out their pent-up opinions, and many problems were solved in a timely manner. Five pieces of mechanical equipment were repaired, and two are being repaired. The employees operate much more conveniently and safely. Under these circumstances, the enthusiasm of the vast majority of employees for production is unprecedentedly high. Recently, they revised the third-quarter production increase plan of 350 tons of coke, preparing to increase production by 1,300 tons to 1,500 tons, while improving the quality of coke and eliminating accidents. They also used these fighting indicators as competition conditions to challenge the mechanized production of No. 1 and No. 2 coke ovens, striving to become an advanced production unit. Many employees on this furnace said: In the past, where would we dare to make such plans for our manually operated furnace!

It has only been more than twenty days since the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant fully launched the rectification movement. In these short days, we can see from one side of the coking department alone: the vigorous airing of views by the employees promotes the leaders to quickly overcome their shortcomings, and the transformation of the leadership's work style in turn encourages the production enthusiasm of the vast number of employees. This magnificent movement is shaking everyone's hearts, pushing the work and ideological style of many people to a new starting point!
