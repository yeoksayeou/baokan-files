The Unusual Twenty Days
By our reporter Guo Longchun

Large-Character Posters Posted One After Another

Comrade Yuan Deshun, the branch secretary of the machine repair section and mechanical technician and section chief of the coking department at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, has been feeling uneasy these past few days.

On the second day of the plant's mobilization for vigorous airing of views, the coking department's employees posted fifty-three large-character posters, of which seven or eight directly criticized the machine repair work. In the following four days, this type of large-character poster increased to more than twenty. Some criticized the workshop for not repairing the coking equipment in a timely manner; some criticized the workshop leaders for not responding to the employees' requests to repair safety equipment for a long time; and some simply criticized by name.

"The track for the reversing furnace top charging car is not straight, and the furnace door machine is not easy to use. I have mentioned it to the leaders several times, but it has not been repaired until now. Why has the old problem not been solved?"

"The No. 1 furnace conveyor belt is so heavy that it cannot be pushed, the track is uneven, and a clip has to be changed every shift, and the belt is torn. May I ask Yuan Deshun, why can't your work be carried out well?" Some people wrote large-character posters titled "Exposing Yuan Deshun's Bureaucratism," saying:

"During the 'May Day' holiday, the imperfect conveyor belt was pushed onto the furnace platform... The rollers, protective plates, etc., are broken and not repaired... You should seriously examine your bureaucratic style!" The "Airing Views Garden," composed of billboards and wooden boards and reed mats, was filled with colorful large-character posters. People reading the large-character posters jostled each other. Such open and sharp criticism had never happened before.

"Why do everyone have so many opinions about me?!" Yuan Deshun, who usually works diligently, was standing in the crowd looking at these large-character posters. At first, he felt a little heavy-hearted.

Later, after thinking carefully, "Isn't this exactly the enthusiastic performance of the masses in helping the Party rectify its work style? The opinions raised by everyone also make me see the shortcomings in my work more clearly!"

What should I do? The "rectify while correcting" instruction repeatedly emphasized by the Party committee is the guide for action.

While asking others to help copy the large-character posters, Yuan Deshun was determined to immediately improve his work.

Plugging Loopholes, Digging Out Root Causes

On the eighth day of the vigorous airing of views, the coking department's general Party branch systematically studied the opinions raised by the employees and specifically arranged to immediately solve the problems that could be solved immediately.

Before this, Comrade Yuan Deshun, together with Comrade Li Ziming, the equipment director, and others, led the employees of the machine repair section to improve several tasks and satisfy some of the production workers' demands.

The women's bathhouse was built last year, but the water pipes were not connected and could not be used. The female workers had to go back to the dormitory with their bodies covered in coal dust and coke powder to take a bath and change clothes after work, and they had a lot of complaints. In the past, the coking department's machine repair section and the factory's welfare department pushed each other, and neither came to solve the problem. This time, after the female workers posted large-character posters, Yuan Deshun and the comrades in the machine repair section took the initiative to connect the water pipes on the third day. Now, the girls can take a clean bath after work and then return to the dormitory relaxed and happy.

The coke oven pushing machine was difficult to push because the oil box was broken. The employees had raised their opinions in the past but it was not repaired. After the workers posted large-character posters criticizing it this time, Comrade Yuan Deshun and the machine repair workers went to repair it on the 27th of last month.

In the first twenty days since the start of the airing of views, they solved fifteen problems, another four were being solved, and ten were included in the recent work plan. The equipment problems raised in the previous three large-character posters have also been repaired or initially repaired.

During this period, Yuan Deshun actively solved the problems raised by the employees, plugging the loopholes in the current work; on the other hand, he was also examining his ideological style and looking for ways to fundamentally overcome the shortcomings.

Yuan Deshun was an apprentice at the age of seventeen, and came to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant at the age of twenty-one. He did hard work for twelve years under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Japanese puppets. In 1952, he became a foreman; in the same year, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. In 1953, he was promoted to mechanical technician of the coking department. Since liberation, under the cultivation and education of the Party, his class consciousness has been greatly improved; however, he has not deeply understood the working methods of the Party's mass line since he took on leadership work.

When he was talking to reporters about his experience in the rectification movement, he said: "In the past, my work was not in-depth and I did not pay enough attention to the opinions of the masses. Some problems were not difficult to solve, but they were not solved in time because I did not pay attention to them ideologically. In fact, some equipment defects may seem like small problems to us, but for production workers, they are directly related to their safety and the quality of their labor conditions. In the future, I will go deep into the masses, care about the hardships of the employees, and solve the problems in production in a timely manner."

In the past, workers criticized them for often using plans as a shield. When they asked to repair something, it was often "not included in the plan," "no materials were prepared," or "too busy." Now, the flames of the large-character posters have burned away the ideological style of being divorced from the masses, and the remaining planning problems have been solved smoothly. In the past, the monthly plan was discussed in the workshop, and the weekly plan was arranged by themselves. Now, the weekly plan is also supplemented and revised in a timely manner based on the opinions of the employees. As for the clichés such as "no plan" and "too busy," no one hangs them on their lips anymore.

In the past, Comrade Yuan Deshun did not go down to the grassroots level too often, and sometimes the production workers would not see his face for a day or two; now, on the coking furnace, Yuan Deshun can be seen bending over to inspect the machinery every day, or standing with the workers, studying how to improve the equipment. Sometimes, in the fiery light of the coke oven at night, his figure can also be seen.

A Common New Starting Point

On September 13, all the workers of the reversing furnace sent a congratulatory letter to the machine repair section in a big red envelope. The letter said:

"Respected leaders of the machine repair section and all worker comrades: ...After the Party committee report on August 23, from the next day you took the initiative to repair the turntable, small railway, furnace door machine, coke quenching water pipes, etc. of our small furnace, ensuring the safe production of the small furnace. The turntable of the original small furnace No. 2 row often derailed. After you repaired it, there have been no derailment accidents for twenty days. This is enough to prove that through the study of the rectification movement, you have improved your work enthusiasm and achieved rectification while correcting... We are willing to continue to learn from each other and make progress together in the rectification movement!"

People who understand the ideological situation of the employees know that it is not a simple matter for production workers to write a letter praising Yuan Deshun and the section he leads.

In the past, many production workers were a little lazy to raise their opinions on improving the equipment. They said: Anyway, the leaders are just "sending an umbrella after it rains" and "closing the door after the thief has left." They don't respond to opinions in advance, and when an accident occurs, the director and the technician all come down! Even at the beginning of the rectification movement, some workers were still skeptical about whether the problems could be solved if they raised their opinions.

Now, when I visited the workers in the coking department, many people said at the beginning: "The rectification movement is really effective!" "Now the leaders are very different, and the transformation of the mechanical technicians is very obvious!" Some people then said: The workers have now said what is in their hearts, and the leaders are immediately solving the problems that can be solved now. Everyone feels comfortable and the enthusiasm for production is even greater!

The facts are also true. Take the reversing furnace as an example. This unit was just established in March of this year, and the previous production situation has not been good. During the rectification movement, more than 160 of them posted 90 large-character posters. Many people spoke out their pent-up opinions, and many problems were solved in a timely manner. Five pieces of mechanical equipment were repaired, and two are being repaired. The employees operate much more conveniently and safely. Under these circumstances, the enthusiasm of the vast majority of employees for production is unprecedentedly high. Recently, they revised the third-quarter production increase plan of 350 tons of coke, preparing to increase production by 1,300 tons to 1,500 tons, while improving the quality of coke and eliminating accidents. They also used these fighting indicators as competition conditions to challenge the mechanized production of No. 1 and No. 2 coke ovens, striving to become an advanced production unit. Many employees on this furnace said: In the past, where would we dare to make such plans for our manually operated furnace!

It has only been more than twenty days since the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant fully launched the rectification movement. In these short days, we can see from one side of the coking department alone: the vigorous airing of views by the employees promotes the leaders to quickly overcome their shortcomings, and the transformation of the leadership's work style in turn encourages the production enthusiasm of the vast number of employees. This magnificent movement is shaking everyone's hearts, pushing the work and ideological style of many people to a new starting point!

　　不平常的二十天
　　本报记者  郭龙春
　　接连贴出的大字报
    石景山钢铁厂机修工段支部书记、炼焦部机械技师兼工段长苑德顺同志，这几天心情很不宁静。
    厂里动员大鸣大放的第二天，炼焦部的职工贴出了五十三张大字报，其中直接批评机修工作的就有七、八张。以后的四天，这类大字报又增加到二十多张。有的批评车间没有及时修理炼焦设备；有的批评车间领导对职工修整安全设备的要求长期没有答理；有的干脆指着名字批评。
    “倒焰炉炉顶装车轨道不直，炉门机也不好用。向领导提了数次，到现在没有修理。为什么老问题竟没人解决？”
    “一炉皮带机沉得推不动，铁道又不平，每班要换卡子，而且撕皮带。请问苑德顺，你的工作为什么不能很好开展？”有的人以“揭发苑德顺官僚主义”为题写大字报说：
    “‘五一’将设备不完善的皮带机推上炉台，……滚筒、护板等坏了，也不修理……你应当好好检查一下你的官僚主义作风！……”由布告牌和木板、芦席组成的“鸣放园地”，贴满了五颜六色的大字报。看大字报的人磨肩擦背。这种公开、尖锐的批评，过去还从来没有过呢。
    “大伙怎么对我有这么多意见啊？！”平时勤勤恳恳工作的苑德顺同志，挤在人群中看着这些大字报，开始的时候心情有些沉重。
    后来仔细一想，“这不正是职工群众热情帮助党整风的表现吗？大伙提的意见也使自己对工作中的缺点看得更清楚了！”
    怎么办呢？党委一再强调的“边整边改”的指示就是行动的指针。
    苑德顺同志一面请人帮着抄大字报，一面下定了立即改进工作的决心。
    堵漏洞，挖病根
    炼焦部党总支在大鸣大放的第八天，就系统地研究了一次职工提的意见，具体布置立即解决马上能够解决的问题。
    在这以前，苑德顺同志就同设备主任李子明同志等一起，领导机修工段的职工改进了几项工作，满足了一些生产工人的要求。
    女工浴室去年修起来以后，水管没有接通不能使用。女工们下了班需要带着满身煤渣、焦末回宿舍洗澡换衣服，意见很大。过去，炼焦部机修工段和厂部福利科互相推托，都不来解决这个问题。这次在女工贴出大字报以后，苑德顺和机修工段的同志们在第三天就主动去把水管修通。现在，姑娘们下班以后，都可以洗得干干净净，然后轻松愉快地回宿舍了。
    一焦炉拦焦机因为油盅坏了，推起来很费力。职工们过去提过意见没有修理。这次工人贴大字报提出批评以后，上月27日苑德顺同志就和机修工人去把它修理好了。
    鸣放开始以来的前二十天，他们就解决了十五个问题，另外有四个正在解决，十个列入了最近的工作计划。前面三张大字报上提出的设备上的毛病，也已经修理完毕或者初步进行了修理。
    在这个期间，苑德顺同志一方面积极解决职工们提出的问题，堵塞目前工作中的漏洞；另一方面，他也在检查自己的思想作风，寻找从根本上克服缺点的途径。
    苑德顺同志十七岁当学徒，二十一岁就来到石景山钢铁厂。在国民党反动派和日伪统治下，干了十二年苦活。1952年，他当了工长；同年，光荣地参加了中国共产党。1953年，被提升为炼焦部机械技师。解放以来，在党的培养教育下，他的阶级觉悟有了很大的提高；但是，他担任领导工作不久，对党的群众路线的工作方法体会得还不深刻。
    他在同记者谈论整风运动的体会的时候说：“过去，我的工作很不深入，对群众的意见不够重视。有些问题解决起来并不困难，但是因为思想上不重视，就没有及时解决。实际上，有些设备方面的缺陷，在我们看起来是小问题，但是对于生产工人来说，就直接关系到他们的安全和劳动条件的好坏。今后，我要深入群众，关心职工疾苦，及时解决生产中的问题。”
    过去，工人批评他们常常拿计划作挡箭牌，要求修理点什么东西，往往是“没有列入计划”、“没有准备材料”、“忙不过来”。现在，大字报的火焰烧掉了脱离群众的思想作风，剩下来的计划问题也就顺利解决了。过去月计划在车间讨论，周计划由他们自己安排，现在周计划也及时根据职工意见作补充修改。至于“没有计划”、“忙不过来”等口头禅，也已经没有人再挂在嘴边了。
    过去，苑德顺同志下去的时间不太多，有时候一两天生产工人都见不到他的面；现在，在炼焦炉上，每天都可以看到苑德顺在弯腰检查机械，或者同工人站在一起，在研究改进设备。有的夜晚，在焦炉熊熊的火光中，也可以看到他的背影。
    共同的新起点
    9月13日，倒焰炉全体工人用大红信封给机修工段送了一封贺信。信中说：
    “敬爱的机修领导及全体工人同志们：……8月23日党委报告以后，从第二天你们就主动地修理了我们小炉的转盘、小铁道、炉门机、熄焦水管等，保证了小炉的安全生产。原小炉二排的转盘，经常掉道，经过你们修好以后，已经有二十天没有发生掉道事故。这足以证明，你们通过整风运动的学习，提高了工作热情，做到了边整边改……愿我们在整风运动中继续互相学习，共同进步！”
    了解职工思想情况的人，都知道生产工人写出这封表扬苑德顺和他领导的工段的信，是一件颇不简单的事。
    以前，不少生产工人对于改进设备的意见都有些懒得提了。他们说：反正领导上就是“雨后送伞”、“贼走了关门”，事先提意见不答理，等出了事故，这主任、那技师的就都下来了！就在整风运动刚开始的时候，有一部分工人也还在怀疑提了意见是否能解决问题呢。
    现在，当我在炼焦部访问工人们的时候，不少人一开始就说：“整风运动真顶事！”“现在领导上可大不一样了，机械技师的转变就很明显！”有的人接着还说：工友们这回把心里话都说出来了，现在能解决的问题领导上也马上解决。大伙心里都舒畅了，生产劲头也更大了！
    事实也正是如此。就拿倒焰炉来说吧。这个单位是今年3月间刚成立的，过去的生产情况一直不够好。整风运动中，他们一百六十多个人贴出了九十张大字报。许多人把积在心里的意见都讲出来了，不少问题及时得到了解决。光是机械设备就修好了五件，有两件正在修理。职工们操作起来，轻便安全得多了。在这种情况下，绝大部分职工生产热情空前高涨。最近，他们修改了第三季度增产三百五十吨焦炭的计划，准备增产一千三百吨到一千五百吨，同时要提高焦炭质量，消灭事故。他们还用这些奋斗指标作为竞赛条件，向机械化生产的一焦炉、二焦炉提出挑战，争取成为先进生产单位。这个炉上的不少职工都说：过去，我们这个人工操作的炉子哪里敢作这样的打算呀！
    石景山钢铁厂全面开展整风运动以来，不过才二十多天。在这短短的日子里，我们仅仅从炼焦部的一个侧面就可以看出：职工大鸣大放推动领导迅速克服着缺点，领导作风的转变反过来又鼓舞了广大职工的生产热情。这个波澜壮阔的运动，震动着每个人的心，把多少人的工作和思想作风都推上了一个新的起点！
