    Our Newspaper, London, 14th Dispatch: According to British newspapers, the "Peking Opera Troupe" sent by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan will soon perform in London. Some newspapers refer to this Chiang gang "Peking Opera Troupe," which has stolen the name of the "China Peking Opera Theatre" that came to Britain in 1955, as the "authentic Peking Opera Troupe" and claim that it is the "first" performance of Chinese Peking Opera in London. This deceptive tactic is clearly related to the "two Chinas" activity that a small group of people in Britain are trying to promote. The British public and social figures are very dissatisfied with this despicable activity. In recent days, the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association has received many calls inquiring about the situation. After they understood the scam, they returned their reserved seats to the theatre. Mr. Mainwaring, Vice-Chairman of the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association, told reporters: This attempt to "steal the great achievements of the real Beijing China Peking Opera Theatre" is "very shameful, and it is a great pity that some people in the British theatre community have allowed themselves to participate in this activity." When talking about some people in Britain who thought that they could use the trick of substituting the spurious for the genuine to use the "troupe" from Taiwan to promote their "two Chinas" policy to the British public, Mr. Mainwaring said: "There is no doubt that this political plot will be completely bankrupt, because no one believes that the Chiang Kai-shek clique can have any power without American arms."
    When interviewed by reporters, Labour MP John Baird first listed some of the progress made in cultural exchanges and trade between China and Britain in the recent period, as well as the prospect of greater progress in the future. He then said: "In Britain, many of us hope that the day will come soon when China is restored to its legitimate seat in the United Nations," but there are some people in Britain who are trying to undermine the growing friendship between our two peoples. They are using the "two Chinas" policy to achieve their conspiracy. Therefore, it is necessary to expose and oppose any activities in this regard. These people are trying to call the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force's troupe the "China Peking Opera Theatre." This approach is naturally ridiculous. But from a political point of view, it is dangerous and can be used as a tool to promote the "two Chinas policy." Finally, he pointed out that this behavior "seriously endangers peace in the Far East."

　　英正直人士唾骂蒋家戏班
　　许多人明白真相后纷纷退掉订座
    本报伦敦14日专电  据英国报纸报道，台湾蒋介石集团派来的“京剧团”不日在伦敦登台表演。有些报纸把这个盗用了1955年来英的“中国京剧院”名义的蒋帮“京剧团”，称作“正宗的京剧团”，并且说是中国京剧“首次”在伦敦上演。这种鱼目混珠的手法，显然同英国一小撮人所极力推售的“两个中国”的活动有关。英国的公众和社会名流对于这种卑鄙的活动十分不满。连日来，英中友协曾接到不少电话，询问有关情况。当他们明了了这种骗局后，便向剧院退回了所订的座位。英中友协副会长曼因先生向记者说：这种“盗用真正的北京中国京剧院的伟大成就”的企图是“很可耻的，十分遗憾的是英国戏剧界中竟有人让自己参与这个活动。”谈到在英国有人以为可以使用偷天换日的手法利用台湾的“剧团”来向英国公众推销其“两个中国”的政策的时候，曼因先生说：“毫无疑问，这种政治图谋将彻底破产，因为没有人相信蒋介石集团没有美国军火还能有什么力量。”
    工党议员约翰·贝尔德在接见记者时，首先列述了最近一个时期以来中、英两国在文化交流和贸易往来方面的一些进展，以及今后更大进展的前景。他接着说：“在英国我们许多人都希望中国被恢复在联合国的合法地位的日子快点到来”，但是在英国却有一些人企图破坏我们两国人民之间的日益增长的友谊。他们正在运用“两个中国”的政策来达到他们的阴谋。因此有必要来揭露和反对这方面的任何活动。这些人企图把蒋介石空军的剧团叫做“中国京剧院”。这种手法自然是很可笑的。但是从政治方面看来，这是危险的，它可以被用作鼓吹“两个中国政策的工具”。最后他指出这种行为“严重地危害了远东的和平”。
