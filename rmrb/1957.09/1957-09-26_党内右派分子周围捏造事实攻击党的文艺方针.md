Fabricating Facts to Attack the Party's Literary and Artistic Policy Around Rightists Within the Party

The Guangzhou branch of the Chinese Writers Association held a symposium to expose the anti-Party words and deeds around rightists and writers within the Party.

Zhou Wei vehemently attacked the direction of literary and artistic creation towards workers, peasants, and soldiers put forward by the Party. He said: "The Party stubbornly severed the writer's history. This cannot be written, that cannot be written, only workers, peasants, and soldiers can be written, and even only current movements are allowed to be written." He slandered the portrayal of Party leadership, bright sides, and positive characters in literary and artistic works as the "three major taboos of the current literary and artistic circles" and that "'Old hands' are precisely violating these three major taboos." Zhou Wei also fabricated many facts, saying: "The Party members in dramas can only be played by Party members; when plays about workers, peasants, and soldiers are performed, the actors are mostly criticized for being full of petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings on the stage; when heroic characters are portrayed, the playwrights certainly deify the characters, and the actors must also act as deified people. People acting as gods are naturally terrified."

Zhou Wei's anti-communism and anti-socialism are consistent and have historical roots. As early as 1942 to 1943, he participated in the anarchist small group in Guilin at that time and was influenced by nihilistic ideas.

### 党内右派分子周围捏造事实攻击党的文艺方针

    党内右派分子周围捏造事实攻击党的文艺方针
    中国作家协会广州分会举行座谈会，揭露党内右派分子、作家周围的反党言行。
    周围极力攻击党所提出的工农兵创作方向。他说：“党硬是割断了作家的历史，这也不能写，那也不能写，只能写工农兵，甚至只准写当前的运动。”他诬蔑文艺作品中描写党的领导，光明面和正面人物的形象是“当前文艺界的三大清规”而“‘老油条’恰恰是犯了这三大清规。”周围还捏造许多事实说：“戏剧里的党员只能由党员来演；演到工农兵的戏，演员大都给批评为小资产阶级思想感情满台飞；演到英雄人物，剧作者固然把人物神化了，而演员也得作神化了的人来演。人而演神，自然胆战心惊。”
    周围反共、反社会主义是一贯性的，而且有其历史根源。早在1942年到1943年期间，他就参加了当时桂林的无政府主义小集团，受了虚无主义思想的影响。
