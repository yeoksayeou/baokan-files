The Eisenhower Doctrine is Colonialism Hostile to Arab National Independence
Ha. Muhi al-Din, Member of the Egyptian National Assembly

Many people believe that the imperialist aggression against Egypt was due to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. This is incorrect. The nationalization of the company did not cause any loss to the shareholders in terms of property ownership. The Egyptian government has announced that it will compensate the shareholders at the price quoted on the Paris Stock Exchange on July 26, 1956, the day of nationalization. It is well known that the company and all its properties will belong to the Egyptian government in 1968, as expressly stipulated in the company's concession, and it is also stipulated that this company is an Egyptian joint-stock company. As for freedom of navigation, the Egyptian government has announced that it will effectively guarantee it in accordance with the 1888 Constantinople Convention.

So, what are the reasons for the imperialist aggression against Egypt? It is obvious that the reason why imperialism wanted to invade Egypt was that Egypt pursued an independent policy in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference. Since President Nasser returned from Bandung in 1955, Egypt has begun to establish economic, political, and cultural relations with countries all over the world, regardless of their social and political systems.

As a result of implementing an independent policy, Egypt has been able to solve its own economic difficulties through the establishment of free relations with countries all over the world; it has been able to sell Egyptian cotton at high prices and buy a large number of machines from socialist countries to equip Egyptian factories; Egypt has also imported weapons that have been monopolized by Western countries for many years. In this way, Egypt has become a military and economic force in the Arab East. Subsequently, Egypt pursued a policy of Arab liberation in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference, assisting all Arab nations struggling to achieve genuine independence, and Arab unity has become a reality.

The imperialists felt the danger. Because if Egypt were allowed to live in peace for a long time, Egypt would not only become a force in the Arab East, but also support the Arab nations in political, economic, and military terms. This would threaten the imperialists' oil and other interests in the Arab East. This is the main reason for the aggression against Egypt, even though they used the canal issue as an excuse for aggression.

The purpose of the tripartite aggression by Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt was to overthrow the Egyptian national government led by Nasser, place Egypt under the control of the imperialists again, undermine the unity of the Arab nations, and destroy the Arab nations one by one.

However, the failure of the aggression has produced many consequences in the Arab East. Nasser's position at home and abroad has been further consolidated, and the unity of the Arab nations is stronger than before. From the imperialist point of view, Britain and France have lost all prestige in Arab countries, and their orders are no longer effective in this region.

The United States attempted to take the place of Britain and France in order to fill the so-called vacuum left by the withdrawal of British and French forces from this region. As a result, President Eisenhower announced that he would provide 200 million U.S. dollars in aid to Middle Eastern countries each year; he would use armed forces to assist those countries when they were attacked by countries under the so-called international communist rule, without having to obtain the consent of the U.S. Congress.

The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a new attempt, the purpose of which is to supplement the various colonialist attempts to drag Arab countries into imperialist military alliances.

What does he mean by so-called international communism? Does it refer to those communist countries bordering the Middle East, such as the Soviet Union or Bulgaria? Of course not. Because, if it refers to the communist countries' attacks on the Middle East, then it must be pointed out which communist countries are attacking. But doing so would reduce the value of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" because: (1) it is precisely these communist countries that provided assistance to Egypt when it was invaded; it is precisely these communist countries that continue to assist Arab countries so that they can implement independent policies. The position taken by the Soviet Union during the imperialist aggression against Egypt, even if it was not the only reason for stopping the aggression, was one of the important reasons for stopping the aggression. Therefore, if the words "communist countries" were mentioned at that time, the masses of the Arab countries would definitely respond with cynicism. (2) If the only reason for using the U.S. armed forces is the attack by communist countries, then it means that Eisenhower can never use his armed forces; it is inconceivable that communist countries would attack Arab countries, because it is precisely these communist countries that are helping Arab countries to maintain their independence. Therefore, Eisenhower did not dare to mention communist countries, but only dared to use the flexible term "international communism" in order to facilitate finding an excuse to use armed forces.

It is still not clear what is meant by the so-called "international communism"? Does it refer to the connection of a certain country with an international communist organization? Or does it refer to the strength of the Communist Party in a certain country? The former does not exist, and no Middle Eastern country has any connection with an international communist organization. As for the strength of the Communist Party in various countries, it should be measured by the number of communists and the number of communist parliamentarians. Everyone knows that in Arab countries, the number of communists is not as large as in Israel, France, Italy, India, Britain, and the United States. The number of communist parliamentarians in the parliaments of Arab countries is very small; Syria has only one parliamentarian; Jordan has two; and the rest of the Arab countries have no communist parliamentarians. Israel, however, has five communist parliamentarians; France has 150; Italy has more than 150; and India has 29.

Therefore, the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to create military blocs within Arab countries, blocs that are subordinate to the United States and hostile to the liberation policies pursued by Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries; the recent American conspiracy in Syria illustrates that the true purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to eliminate the independence of Syria, isolate Egypt, and then eliminate the independence of Egypt.

That is to say, the real purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to eliminate the independence of the Arab nations and to destroy the strong unity of the Arab nations surrounding Egypt. Then, the main enemy of colonialism is Arab nationalism; the term "international communism" has become synonymous with the nationalist forces in the Arab East; the term "international communism" has become an excuse for imperialists to eliminate the nationalist forces in the Middle East.

The purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to sever the relations between Arab countries and socialist countries, in order to prevent the people of Arab countries from developing in the direction of independence, so that Arab countries will completely follow the West. However, the Arab people who have carried out bloody struggles for many years will not be deceived, and they will continue to struggle until they eliminate the "Eisenhower Doctrine," just as they killed the Baghdad Pact. The temporary achievements of American colonialists and their pawns in certain Arab countries will not last long, and the people of these countries will rise up for the independence of their motherland, and they will overthrow their reactionary governments. The liberation ranks of the Arab people will continue to move forward in the direction of complete independence.

The people of Arab countries will receive the full support of the people of Asia and Africa, the people of socialist countries, and all peace-loving people, so that they can achieve final victory and raise the banner of independence and peace. And those countries that have accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine" have become a warning to other Arab countries. Those who succumb to American colonialism and are not loyal to the common goals of the Arab nations will not have a good end.

To recognize whether an individual, political party, or group in an Arab country loves the motherland, just look at what position they take on the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Whoever opposes the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a patriot; whoever supports the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a traitor to the motherland and Arab nationalism.

The unity of the people of all countries in the world with the Arab people will bring about the victory of the Arab national movement at an early date, at which time, only the banner of the Arab people, the banner of peace and freedom, will be raised in Arab countries.

### 艾森豪威尔主义是敌视阿拉伯民族独立的殖民主义

    艾森豪威尔主义是敌视阿拉伯民族独立的殖民主义
    埃及国民议会议员　哈·毛希丁
    有许多人认为，帝国主义侵略埃及是由于苏伊士运河公司的国有化。这是不正确的。因为公司的国有化，在财产的所有权方面，没有使股东们受到任何损失。埃及政府已经宣布，将按照1956年7月26日国有化那一天巴黎交易所的牌价赔偿给股东们。人们都知道，按该公司所获得的特许执照明文规定，公司和公司的全部财产，将在1968年归埃及政府所有，并且还规定，这家公司是一个埃及的股份公司。至于航行自由，埃及政府已经宣布按照1888年君士坦丁堡公约予以切实保证。
    那末，帝国主义侵略埃及的原因究竟是什么呢？很明显，帝国主义之所以要侵略埃及，是由于埃及按照万隆会议的原则奉行了独立的政策。从1955年纳赛尔总统自万隆回来以后，埃及就开始同世界各国建立了经济的、政治的、文化的关系，不论那些国家是什么社会制度和政治制度。
    实行独立政策的结果，埃及能够通过同世界各国建立自由关系的途径解决自身的经济困难；能够以高价出售埃及棉花，而且从社会主义国家买进大批的机器来装备埃及的工厂；埃及还输入了多年来为西方国家所垄断的武器。这样，埃及就成了阿拉伯东方一种军事的和经济的力量。随后，埃及按照万隆会议的原则奉行阿拉伯解放政策，援助了为实现真正的独立而斗争的所有的阿拉伯民族，阿拉伯的团结已经变成了事实。
    帝国主义者感到了危险。因为如果让埃及处于长期的和平中，埃及不仅会成为阿拉伯东方的一种力量，还有可能在政治、经济、军事等方面支援阿拉伯各民族。这就会威胁帝国主义者在阿拉伯东方的石油利益和其它利益。这是侵略埃及的主要原因，尽管他们以运河问题为侵略的借口。
    英、法、以三国侵略埃及的目的，是要推翻以纳赛尔为领导的埃及民族政府，把埃及重新置于帝国主义者控制之下，破坏阿拉伯各民族的团结，使阿拉伯各民族一个跟一个地遭到毁灭。
    然而，侵略的失败在阿拉伯东方产生了许多后果。纳赛尔在国内和国际的地位更加巩固了，阿拉伯民族的团结比以前更强大了。从帝国主义者方面说，英、法两国在阿拉伯各国丧尽了威信，在这个地区，英法两国的号令行不通了。
    美国企图取英、法的地位而代之，以便填补英、法势力从这个地区撤出后所遗留下来的所谓真空。于是，艾森豪威尔总统宣布他每年要以两亿美元援助中东国家；在所谓国际共产主义统治的国家进攻中东各国的时候，他将使用武装部队援助那些国家，而不必取得美国国会的同意。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”是一种新的企图，其目的是补充那些把阿拉伯国家拉入帝国主义军事同盟的各种殖民主义的企图。
    他所谓的国际共产主义是指什么呢？是指同中东国家接壤的那些共产主义国家，如苏联或保加利亚吗？当然不是的。因为，如果所指的是共产主义国家对中东的进攻，那末一定得指出是那些共产主义国家来。但是这样做就会降低“艾森豪威尔主义”的价值。因为：（1）在埃及遭受侵略的时候援助埃及的正就是这些共产主义国家；继续援助阿拉伯各国，使它们能实行独立的，也正就是这些共产主义国家。在帝国主义侵略埃及期间，苏联所采取的立场，即使不是制止侵略的唯一原因，也是制止侵略的重要原因之一。因此，当时如果提出“共产主义国家”这样的字眼，阿拉伯各国的人民群众一定报之以冷嘲热讽。（2）假如说只有共产主义国家的进攻是使用美国武装部队的原因，那就是说，艾森豪威尔永远不能使用他的武装部队了；共产主义国家进攻阿拉伯国家，这是不可设想的，因为帮助阿拉伯国家维护其独立的正就是这些共产主义国家。因此艾森豪威尔不敢提共产主义国家，只敢使用“国际共产主义”这样富于弹性的词句，以便于给使用武装部队寻找借口。
    到现在还没有弄清楚，所谓“国际共产主义”所指的究竟是什么？是某一国家同国际共产主义组织的联系呢？还是某一国家内共产党的力量呢？前者是不存在的，没有任何中东国家同国际共产主义组织有联系。至于各国共产党的力量的大小，那就要用共产党员人数的多寡和共产党议员人数的多寡为标准。大家知道，在阿拉伯国家，共产党员的人数比起以色列、法国、意大利、印度、英国和美国来，并不算多。阿拉伯各国议会中共产党议员的人数是屈指可数的；叙利亚只有一个议员；约旦有两个；其余的阿拉伯国家都没有共产党的议员。以色列却有五个共产党的议员；法国有一百五十个，意大利有一百五十个以上，印度有二十九个。
    因此，“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的就是在阿拉伯国家内制造军事集团，这个集团服从美国，敌视埃及、叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家所奉行的解放政策；最近美国在叙利亚进行的阴谋可以说明， “艾森豪威尔主义”的真正目的是消灭叙利亚的独立，使埃及孤立，然后消灭埃及的独立。
    这就是说，“艾森豪威尔主义”的真正目的是消灭阿拉伯各民族的独立，是破坏围绕着埃及的阿拉伯各民族的坚强团结。那末，殖民主义政策的主要敌人就是阿拉伯民族主义；“国际共产主义”这个名词，就变成阿拉伯东方民族主义力量的同义词了；“国际共产主义”这个名词，就成了帝国主义者为消灭中东民族主义力量而采取的借口了。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的目的，是断绝阿拉伯各国与社会主义国家的关系，以便阻止阿拉伯各国人民向着独立的方向发展，从而使阿拉伯各国完完全全地跟着西方走。然而常年来进行了流血斗争的阿拉伯人民是不会受骗的，他们将继续斗争下去，直到消灭“艾森豪威尔主义”，正如他们使巴格达条约死亡一样。美国殖民主义者及其走狗们在某些阿拉伯国家内获得的暂时成就是不会长久的，这些国家的人民将要为了祖国的独立而奋起，他们将要把本国的反动政府推翻。阿拉伯人民的解放行列将朝着完全独立的方向继续前进。
    阿拉伯各国人民将会得到亚、非人民、社会主义国家人民以及所有爱好和平的人民的全力支持，从而使他们能够取得最后的胜利，举起独立与和平的旗帜。而那些接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”的国家，却成为其他阿拉伯国家的殷鉴。屈从美国殖民主义而不忠于阿拉伯各民族共同目标的人，是不会有好的下场的。
    要认识阿拉伯国家的个人、政党或团体是不是热爱祖国，只要看他们对于“艾森豪威尔主义”采取什么立场。谁反对“艾森豪威尔主义”，谁就是爱国主义者；谁支持“艾森豪威尔主义”，谁就是祖国和阿拉伯民族主义的叛徒。
    世界各国人民同阿拉伯人民的团结将使阿拉伯民族运动的胜利早日实现，那时候，在阿拉伯各国升起的只有阿拉伯人民的旗帜、和平和自由的旗帜。
