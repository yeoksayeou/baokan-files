    Television Microscope

    Czechoslovakia recently invented a television microscope; live cocci magnified 20,000 times can be seen on the television screen.

    Up to now, only this kind of microscope can see live cocci. In this microscope, the sharpness of the image and the contrast of the graphics can be magnified. This microscope can be observed by many people at the same time, while other microscopes can only be observed by one person.

    The operation of this microscope is also very simple. The image is reflected from the eyepiece of the optical microscope into the television transmission dark box. The image is magnified in the dark box and then transmitted through wires to one or several receivers. Using cables, the image can be transmitted from the dark box to the receiver for six hundred meters. This microscope is very light and portable. (Xu Zisen)

    电视显微镜
    捷克斯洛伐克最近发明一种电视显微镜；在电视屏上可以看到放大两万倍的活的球菌。
    到目前为止，只有这种显微镜可以看到活的球菌。在这种显微镜里，影像的清晰度和图形对照都可以放大。这种显微镜能同时供许多人观察，而其他显微镜只能供一人观察。
    这种显微镜的操作也很简单。影像从光显微镜的接目镜反映到电视传送暗箱里，暗箱里将影像放大，再通过电线传送到一个或几个收像机里去。利用电缆，影像从暗箱到收像机则可以传送六百公尺。这种显微镜很轻便，可以携带。（许子森）
