Xinhua News Agency, Jishou, 16th: The first session of the First People's Congress of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture opened in Jishou yesterday.

Liu Chun, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. Tan Yubao, Deputy Governor of Hunan Province and Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as guests from Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hubei provinces also participated in the meeting.

This meeting will elect members of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee and the President of the Autonomous Prefecture Intermediate People's Court, and will jointly study the various socialist construction tasks of the Autonomous Prefecture.

At yesterday's meeting, Shi Bangzhi (Miao nationality), the former Governor of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Secretary of the CPC Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee, delivered a report on the achievements of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Shi Bangzhi said that over the past five years, the Autonomous Prefecture has realized the nationalization of autonomous organs. More than 96% of farmers in the prefecture have joined advanced agricultural cooperatives, basically completing the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is estimated that this year the prefecture's grain output will increase by 10.7% compared to the bumper harvest of 1955, and by 34% compared to 1952.

Shi Bangzhi said that in order to actively change the backward economic and cultural situation of minority areas, the central government has given great support to the Xiangxi region in terms of finance and economy. Over the past five years, the state's total investment in basic construction in the Autonomous Prefecture has reached 10.3 million yuan, with loans of more than 16.9 million yuan, relief funds of more than 3 million yuan, and preferential payments of more than 1.67 million yuan. Up to now, the irrigated area of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects built in the Autonomous Prefecture has increased from 960,000 mu to 1.38 million mu. Before liberation, there were no factories or mines in the mountainous areas of western Hunan, but now 58 large and small factories and mines have been established. The backward state of transportation has also been basically changed.

Cultural and educational undertakings in the Autonomous Prefecture are also developing rapidly. At present, there are 200,391 primary school students in the prefecture, an increase of 35,826 from 1952, when the Autonomous Prefecture was established. The development of Miao primary school education is particularly rapid, with an average of one primary school student for every six Miao people. There are more than 12,000 middle school students and normal school students in the prefecture, an increase of 82% compared to 1952. In order to strengthen national education, the Autonomous Prefecture has also specially established a national middle school and two national normal schools.

Shi Bangzhi specially mentioned the Communist Party's concern and emphasis on health work in minority areas. The population of the prefecture has increased from 1.5 million in 1952 to more than 1.74 million.

　　土家苗族自治州首届人代会开幕
　　石邦智作自治州五年来各项工作的报告
    据新华社吉首16日电　湘西土家族苗族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议昨天在吉首开幕。
    民族事务委员会副主任刘春出席了会议，并在会上讲了话。湖南省副省长、中共湖南省委书记谭余保，以及贵州、广东、广西和湖北四省的各族来宾也参加了这次会议。
    这次会议将选举自治州人民委员会组成人员和自治州中级人民法院院长，共同研究自治州的各项社会主义建设工作。
    昨天会上，原湘西苗族自治州州长、中共湘西苗族自治州地委书记石邦智（苗族）作了湘西苗族自治州各项工作成就的报告。石邦智说，五年来，自治州实现了自治机关的民族化。全州农民加入高级农业社的占总农户96％以上，基本上完成了农业的社会主义改造。今年估计全州粮食将比大丰收的1955年增产10.7％，比1952年增产34％。
    石邦智说，为了积极改变少数民族地区经济文化的落后面貌，中央在财政经济上给了湘西地区很大的支援。五年来，国家对自治州各项基本建设的投资总额达一千零三十万元，发放贷款一千六百九十多万元，救济款三百多万元，优抚款一百六十七万多元。截至目前止，自治州兴修的小型农田水利灌溉面积由九十六万亩增加到一百三十八万亩。湘西山区解放前没有一个工厂矿山，现在已经建立大小厂矿五十八个。交通运输方面的落后状况也已经基本上改变。
    自治州文教事业也在迅速发展着。现在全州共有小学生二十万零三千九百一十九人，比1952年自治州成立时增加三万五千八百二十六人。其中苗族小学教育发展特别快，平均每六个苗族人当中就有一个小学生。全州共有中学生和师范生一万二千多人，比1952年增加82％。为了加强民族教育工作，自治州还特别建立了一所民族中学和两所民族师范。
    石邦智特别提到共产党对少数民族地区卫生工作的关心和重视。全州人口已由1952年的一百五十万人增加到一百七十四万多人。
