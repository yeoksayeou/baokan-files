    The Story of Peanuts
    —Poems Recording the Sanmenxia Project
    Wu Yanhen
    It was a windy and rainy dusk,
    The postman delivered an unfamiliar letter,
    And a mysterious square wooden box,
    Opened it, and it turned out to be a box of peanuts.
    This letter came from a remote mountain village,
    A team of Young Pioneers signed their names on the letter,
    Those lines of attentive handwriting,
    Were full of enthusiasm, hope, and respect.
    This box of rare and precious peanuts,
    Transmits pure and beautiful hearts,
    It was grown by the children,
    And sent to the people building Sanmenxia.
    The peanuts brought sincere greetings,
    It gives us endless inspiration,
    Like bamboo shoots growing taller in the spring,
    Like the autumn tides of the sea, roaring.
    Our diesel mechanic accepted the peanuts,
    And used her painting to thank their kindness.
    She picked up her brush and went to the hilltop,
    Carefully and skillfully depicting Sanmen;
    Then sat under the lamp, facing the mirror,
    Depicting her own mischievous face;
    Beneath the drilling tower, stands a girl,
    With a pair of charming eyes!
    One painting wasn't enough to satisfy her,
    She then used her imagination to guide her brush,
    Painting another model of the hydroelectric station.
    Our geologist accepted the peanuts,
    And sent a packet of flower seeds to express his heart—
    These flower seeds were born in my Jiangnan hometown,
    And I cultivated them on the banks of the Yellow River;
    Let flowers bloom around our tents,
    And also let flowers bloom in your schools,
    Your farms, your homes!
    If you ask: what kind of flower is this?
    Let's call it: Vanguard Flower, Vanguard Heart!
    Our driller accepted the peanuts,
    He couldn't sleep soundly that night,
    Closing his eyes, he saw the children's faces,
    Opening his eyes, he heard the children's voices.
    He originally wanted to use the bonus to buy a pen,
    To send to his lover in the collective farm,
    No! He will buy a stack of pictorials and books,
    As gifts for the children.
    Our old captain accepted the peanuts,
    His suggestion was met with applause,
    Let's use peanuts to show our will,
    Let's use peanuts to make a model of the hydroelectric station,
    In the future Sanmenxia exhibition,
    Let people know about our Young Pioneers!

    花生的故事
    ——三门峡纪事诗
    吴烟痕
    那是一个多风多雨的黄昏，
    邮递员送来一封陌生的信，
    又一只令人莫测的方形木盒，
    拆开一看，原来是一盒花生。
    这封信来自偏远的山村，
    一队红领巾在信上签名，
    那一行行专心致志的笔迹，
    充满了热情、希望和尊敬。
    这盒稀有而珍贵的花生，
    传送着纯洁美丽的心灵，
    它经孩子们培植结果，
    送给建设三门峡的人们。
    花生送来真挚的慰问，
    它给我们吸取不尽的感情，
    就像春日的笋尖节节生长，
    又像大海的秋潮一样喧腾。
    我们的柴油工收下花生，
    用她的画幅去感谢盛情。
    她拿起画笔，走上山头，
    精工巧手地描绘着三门；
    又坐在灯下，面对明镜，
    描绘着自己俏皮的脸形；
    钻塔下，站着一个姑娘，
    有一对迷人的眼睛！
    画好一幅，还不能称心，
    她又用幻想来指挥画笔，
    再画一幅水电站的模型。
    我们的地质员收下花生，
    寄一包花籽去表达内心——
    这花籽诞生在江南的家乡，
    是我把它栽培到黄河之滨；
    鲜花开满我们的帐篷周围，
    也要鲜花开满你们的学校、
    你们的农庄、你们的家庭！
    若要问：这是哪一类花种？
    就叫它：尖兵之花，尖兵的心！
    我们的钻探手收下花生，
    这一夜怎么也不能睡稳，
    阖上眼，看到孩子们的面容，
    睁开眼，听到孩子们的声音。
    他本想拿奖金买一支钢笔，
    送给远在集体农庄的爱人，
    不！买一束画报和书籍，
    作为赠给孩子们的礼品。
    我们的老机长收下花生，
    他的建议获得一片掌声，
    用花生来表明我们的意志，
    用花生做个水电站的模型，
    在未来的三门峡展览会里，
    让人们知道我们的红领巾！
