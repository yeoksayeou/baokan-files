    Strange "Protest"
    He Bi
    On September 2nd, the Japanese government, through its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Muneaki, made a strange "protest" to the Soviet government. It solemnly demanded that the Soviet Union, "on humanitarian grounds," "immediately" and "first of all" cease all atomic weapons testing.
    The Japanese government's attitude is perplexing. It is common knowledge that although the Soviet Union possesses atomic weapons, it never uses them to threaten peace; on the contrary, it uses them to defend peace. Precisely because of this, the Soviet Union has always advocated banning all atomic weapons and ceasing all atomic weapons testing. Just recently, at the London disarmament conference, the Soviet Union reiterated this position. However, the United States and Western countries have consistently refused to reach any agreement in this regard and continue to pursue a policy of atomic threat. Is the Japanese government unaware of these facts? Then why does it never make any demands of the United States, but instead makes a "protest" to the Soviet Union?
    The Japanese people have suffered the disaster of American atomic bombs three times. "Hiroshima," "Nagasaki," "Lucky Dragon," who created these tragedies? Hundreds of thousands of Japanese people sacrificed their lives, whose crime was this? Is the Japanese government also unaware of these facts? Then why does it never express any condemnation of the United States, which wields atomic bombs, but instead makes a "protest" to the Soviet Union?
    There can only be one explanation for this strange "protest": the Japanese government is not truly concerned about the safety of the Japanese people; it only wants to please the United States, forgetting everything else. The Japanese government's demand that the Soviet Union "stand on humanitarian grounds" is completely superfluous, because all of the Soviet Union's actions to defend peace prove that it is in line with genuine humanitarianism. However, whether the Japanese government's attitude towards the American atomic threat policy is also in line with humanitarianism is highly questionable.

### 奇怪的“抗议”

    奇怪的“抗议”
    何必
    9月2日，日本政府通过驻苏大使门胁向苏联政府提出了一个奇怪的“抗议”，它煞有其事地要求苏联“站在人道主义立场上”，“立刻”“首先”停止一切原子武器的试验。
    日本政府的这种态度，是令人莫解的。人所共知，苏联虽然拥有原子武器，可是它从不用来威胁和平；相反地，它是用来保卫和平的。正是因为这样，苏联一向主张禁止一切原子武器并停止一切原子武器的试验。就在最近的伦敦裁军会议上，苏联又重申了这种主张。但是，美国和西方国家却始终不愿意在这方面达成任何协议，而是要继续执行原子威胁政策。对于这些事实，难道日本政府不知道吗？那么它为什么从来不向美国提出任何要求，反而向苏联提出“抗议”呢？
    日本人民曾经三次遭受美国原子弹的灾难。“广岛”，“长崎”，“福龙丸”，这究竟是谁制造的悲剧？几十万日本人民牺牲了，这究竟是谁的罪恶？对于这些事实，难道日本政府也不知道吗？那么，它为什么从来不向玩弄原子弹的美国表示任何谴责，反而向苏联提出“抗议”？
    对于这种奇怪的“抗议”，只能有一种解释：日本政府并不是真正为日本人民的安全打算的，它只想讨好美国，而忘掉了一切。日本政府要求苏联“站在人道主义立场上”，完全是多此一举，因为苏联保卫和平的全部行动都证明了它是符合真正的人道主义的。可是，日本政府对美国原子威胁政策所采取的这种态度，是不是也符合人道主义，那就大可怀疑了。
