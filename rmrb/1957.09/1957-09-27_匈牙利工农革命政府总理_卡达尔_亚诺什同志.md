Comrade János Kádár, Premier of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party, is an outstanding activist in the Hungarian revolutionary workers' movement and communist movement, and one of Hungary's prominent party and state leaders.

Comrade Kádár was born in 1912 into a poor peasant family. When he was in high school, he had to work and study part-time. From his childhood as a farmhand to later becoming an apprentice instrument worker, Comrade Kádár tasted the poverty, unemployment, and persecution by the reactionary regime experienced by workers under the capitalist system. From the age of seventeen, he participated in the workers' movement, initially joining the youth organization of metalworkers. In 1931, he joined the Communist Youth Workers’ League. In 1932, he was elected secretary of the secretariat of the central committee of this league. In the same year, Comrade Kádár joined the Communist Party. During the Second World War, Comrade Kádár participated in the leadership of the Hungarian Communist Party and was elected a member of the Party Central Committee in 1942. In 1943, he was elected secretary of the Party Central Committee. At that time, Comrade Kádár carried out tremendous work in organizing the Hungarian working people to oppose the fascist system and the war, and to strive for peace, national independence, and the cause of socialism.

During the Horthy regime, Comrade Kádár was persecuted for engaging in revolutionary activities. From 1931 until the liberation of Hungary, he was under the surveillance of the fascist police and was repeatedly arrested and imprisoned.

After the liberation of Hungary, Comrade Kádár was elected as a member of the National Assembly, and later as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party. From January to May 1945, he was responsible for security work. He later served as the secretary of the Budapest Municipal Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party for several years. At the Third Congress of the Communist Party in 1946, he was elected as the Deputy General Secretary of the Party. In 1948, Comrade Kádár served as the Minister of Interior of the Hungarian People's Republic. In April 1951, Comrade Kádár was arrested and imprisoned due to unfounded and fabricated accusations. After his release from prison and rehabilitation, he served as the First Secretary of the Budapest State Party Committee. At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People’s Party last year, Comrade Kádár was re-elected to the Central Committee and served as a member of the Central Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat.

During the counter-revolutionary rebellion last October, after Nagy openly betrayed the Hungarian people and the cause of socialism, Comrade Kádár and his comrades, including Comrade Marosán György, who came to our country this time, adhered to Marxist-Leninist principles, adhered to the socialist stand, established the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, and mobilized the people to defend the achievements of the socialist cause. At the meeting of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held last June, Comrade Kádár was elected as the First Secretary of the Party.

In September of last year, Comrade Kádár led the delegation of the Hungarian Working People’s Party to participate in the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

    卡达尔同志在1912年生于一个贫穷的雇农家庭。上高小时，就不得不半工半读。从童年作帮工到后来成为仪器工人学徒这一期间，卡达尔同志尝尽了资本主义制度下工人的贫困生活、失业和反动政权的迫害。从十七岁起，他就参加了工人运动，最初他参加五金工人的青年组织。1931年，他参加了共产主义青年工人联盟。1932年被选为这个联盟的中央委员会书记处的书记。同年，卡达尔同志参加了共产党。在第二次世界大战期间，卡达尔同志参加了匈牙利共产党的领导工作，1942年被选为党中央委员会委员。1943年选为党中央委员会书记。当时卡达尔同志在组织匈牙利劳动人民反对法西斯制度和反对战争、争取和平、争取民族独立和社会主义事业方面，进行了巨大的工作。
    在霍尔蒂统治年代，卡达尔同志因从事革命活动而遭到迫害。从1931年到匈牙利解放为止，他处于法西斯警察的监视下，多次遭到逮捕和监禁。
    匈牙利解放后，卡达尔同志被选为国民会议的议员，后来又选为匈牙利共产党中央委员会政治局委员。1945年1月到5月，他负责治安工作。他后来担任了几年匈牙利共产党大布达佩斯市委员会书记的职务。1946年共产党第三次代表大会上，被选为党的副总书记。1948年，卡达尔同志任匈牙利人民政府内务部长。1951年4月，由于无根据的、捏造的控告，卡达尔同志被捕入狱。在出狱和恢复名誉后，曾担任布达佩斯州党委会第一书记职务。在去年匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议上，卡达尔同志重新被选入中央委员会，并任中央政治局委员兼书记处书记。
    去年10月反革命叛乱期间，在纳吉公开叛变匈牙利人民和社会主义事业以后，卡达尔同志和他的战友，包括这次同来我国的马罗山·久尔吉等同志，坚持马克思列宁主义原则，坚持社会主义立场，成立工农革命政府并动员人民来保卫社会主义事业的成果。今年6月举行的匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会的会议上，卡达尔同志被选为党的第一书记。
