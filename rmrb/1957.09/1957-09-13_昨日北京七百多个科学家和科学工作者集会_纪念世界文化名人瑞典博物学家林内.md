Xinhua News Agency, 12th. A commemoration meeting for the 250th anniversary of the birth of Carl Linnaeus, world cultural figure and Swedish naturalist, was held this evening at the Central Committee Auditorium of the Communist Youth League in Beijing. More than seven hundred Chinese scientists and scientific workers attended tonight's commemoration meeting. Also invited to participate in the commemoration meeting were José Venturelli (Chile), Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, and others.

When Vice President Zhu Kezhen of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delivered the opening speech at the commemoration meeting, he said that Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) was an epoch-making figure in the history of modern natural science. In his book "Dialectics of Nature," Engels once referred to the era of the budding of modern natural science in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries as an era marked by Newton (1642-1727) and Linnaeus. The most important work of natural science in that era was to organize the large amount of materials accumulated in the past into a system. Linnaeus devoted his life's energy to the study of plant and animal taxonomy and was the founder of modern biological taxonomy. The "binomial nomenclature" concise Latin description method created by Linnaeus in 1753 identified thousands of plant and animal scientific names, which were adopted by biologists all over the world, thus clarifying the past state of confusion in animal and plant naming.

Zhu Kezhen said that our country is currently engaged in socialist construction and must engage in a large-scale general survey of animals and plants throughout the country. This work is now expecting taxonomists to exert great power. At the same time, we must also learn from Linnaeus's spirit of fighting against nature throughout his life.

Swedish Ambassador to China, Mr. Booker, who was invited to attend the commemoration meeting, then spoke. On behalf of the Swedish government and the Swedish people, he thanked the China Peace Committee, China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the China Association for Science and Technology for the importance and goodwill given to the commemoration of Carl Linnaeus.

Subsequently, Wang Zhenru, Director of the Chinese Botanical Society, introduced Linnaeus's deeds; Hu Xiansu, researcher at the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shou Zhenhuang, researcher at the Institute of Zoology, also introduced Linnaeus's contributions to modern plant taxonomy and zoology, respectively.

　　昨日北京七百多个科学家和科学工作者集会
　　纪念世界文化名人瑞典博物学家林内
    新华社12日讯　世界文化名人、瑞典博物学家卡尔·林内诞生二百五十周年纪念会，今晚在北京共青团中央礼堂举行。七百多名中国的科学家和科学工作者出席了今晚的纪念会。应邀参加纪念会的还有亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长何塞·万徒勒里（智利）等人。
    中国科学院副院长竺可桢在纪念会上致开幕词时说，卡尔·林内（1707—1778）是近代自然科学史上划时代的人物，恩格斯在“自然辩证法”一书中，曾经称十六、七世纪欧洲近代自然科学萌芽时代为牛顿（1642—1727）和林内为标志的一个时代。那个时代自然科学最重要的工作，是整理过去所积累的大量材料，使之成一体系。林内竭尽了毕生精力，从事于植物和动物的分类学研究，是近代生物分类学的奠基者。林内在1753年所创的“双名制”拉丁文简洁叙述法，鉴定了数以千计的植物、动物学名，为以后全世界生物学家所采用，从而廓清了过去动植物命名混乱不清的状态。
    竺可桢说，目前我国正在进行社会主义建设，必得大规模地从事于全国动植物的普查，这一工作正在期待着分类学家发挥巨大的力量。同时，我们也要学习林内毕生同自然界作斗争的精神。
    应邀出席纪念会的瑞典驻华大使布克接着讲话。他代表瑞典政府和瑞典人民，感谢中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国科学院和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会为纪念卡尔·林内所给予的重视和好意。
    随后，中国植物学会理事汪振儒介绍了林内事略；中国科学院植物研究所研究员胡先驌和动物研究所研究员寿振黄，也分别介绍了林内对近代植物分类学和对动物学的贡献。
