At the opening ceremony, Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Culture and Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, expressed heartfelt and warm gratitude on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese literary and art circles for the first performance in our country by the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre, which is renowned throughout the Soviet Union.
