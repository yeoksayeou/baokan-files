Are Ordinary American Families Affluent?

    Not long ago, the American "Worker Daily" published a letter from the wife of a postal worker in Missouri to a member of Congress. The letter complained that her husband's income was meager and could not support a family of four, and they could not even afford to buy a new pair of shoes for their children.
    What was the postal worker's salary? According to the letter, his income was equivalent to that of an average skilled industrial worker in the United States: an annual salary of $4,410.
    At first glance, this seems like a considerable sum. Right-wingers use such generalized figures to praise American life. However, they avoid an important fact, which is that the cost of living is particularly high in the United States, and an income like that of this postal worker is not even enough to maintain a minimum standard of living for a family of four. According to the American Family Budget Report compiled by the Heller Committee for Social Economics Research at the University of California at the beginning of this year, an American family of four needs to spend $5,593 a year to maintain a decent life (with rent alone costing nearly $700). Even according to the index officially published by the United States this year, the cost of living for an American family of four is $4,472 a year.
    In fact, the income of the postal worker mentioned above is already above average in the United States. Most American families earn less than him, often much less. In this regard, "Fortune" magazine provided the following interesting material when comparing the incomes of black and white families in the United States:

    Comparison of Black and White Family Incomes in the United States in the First Half of 1956
    (After-tax income)　Black Families　White Families
    Annual income over $7,500　3.8%　13.1%
    Income between $4,000 and $7,500　15.2%　38.5%
    Income between $2,000 and $4,000　39.9%　28.9%
    Income below $2,000　41.1%　19.5%

    This table shows that in the United States, 81% of black families and 48% of white families earn less than $4,000 a year. More than two-fifths of black families and nearly one-fifth of white families earn less than $2,000, living a hand-to-mouth existence. Even in the most prosperous state of New York, there are still "800,000 families and 595,000 single people, a quarter of the state's population, living below the lowest welfare budget standard." This was admitted by New York Governor Harriman in a speech not long ago.
    Some people only know that American workers generally own their own cars (and even houses) and have an actual weekly income of fifty or sixty dollars, and they think that American workers live very "happily," but they do not see that such income is not enough to maintain a family's basic needs in American society. As for cars, in the United States, a highly developed capitalist country, apart from the luxurious cars of a few people, they are no longer a sign of "wealth," but a daily necessity for transportation. Moreover, most American working-class families buy their cars on installment plans. In order to pay off such debts, not only do both husband and wife need to be guaranteed full-time work (which is becoming increasingly difficult as factories are laying off workers and businesses are generally operating below capacity each month), but the husband also has to work overtime or engage in side jobs after work, sometimes working twelve hours a day. Once factories cut production, then, as a reporter for the American "Worker Daily" recently described in an interview in a major Midwestern city, "the faces of Americans you see are haggard." Not to mention those who are laid off and unemployed. Once the installment payments are not paid on time, not only are the cars (as well as houses and household appliances, etc.) purchased on credit repossessed by the company, but the money already paid is not refunded. Therefore, sitting in such a car (living in such a house, using such furniture) is undoubtedly like wearing shackles, binding the workers more tightly to the feet of the capitalists.　Zhen Ya

### 美国一般家庭生活富裕吗？

    美国一般家庭生活富裕吗？
    不久前，美国“工人日报”刊载了美国密苏里州一个邮局职员的妻子写给国会议员的信。信中诉说她的丈夫收入菲薄，不能维持四口之家的生活，甚至无力为孩子买双新鞋。
    这位邮局职员的薪金是多少呢？根据信中所述，他的收入相当于美国一般熟练产业工人的工资：全年薪水是四千四百一十美元。
    乍听起来，这是一个很不小的数目。右派分子正是用这种笼统的数字来颂扬美国生活的。可是，他们避讳了一个重要的事实，就是在美国，生活费用特别高，像这个邮局职员的收入，甚至还不足以维持四口之家的最低生活水平。按照美国加州大学海勒尔社会经济研究委员会今年年初所编的美国家庭预算报告中的计算，美国一个四口之家要维持像样的生活，一年得开支五千五百九十三美元（其中房租一项就要花近七百美元）。即使根据今年美国官方公布的指数，美国四口之家一年的生活费用也得四千四百七十二美元。
    而事实上，上面所说这个邮局职员的收入在美国已经是中等以上的了。美国大多数家庭收入还不及他，甚至低得多。在这方面，美国“幸福杂志”在比较美国黑人和白人家庭的收入时，提供了下列有意思的材料：
    1956年上半年美国黑人和白人家庭收入比较表
    （纳税后收入）　黑人家庭　白人家庭
    每年收入超过＄7，500　3.8％　13.1％
    收入在＄4，000到＄7，500之间　15.2％　38.5％
    收入在＄2，000到＄4，000之间　39.9％　28.9％
    收入在＄2，000元以下　41.1％　19.5％
    这个表说明，在美国，81％的黑人家庭，48％的白人家庭每年收入少于四千美元。而五分之二以上的黑人家庭和近五分之一的白人家庭收入在二千美元以下，过着半饱的生活。甚至在最富庶的纽约州仍然有“八十万个家庭和五十九万五千名单身汉，即全州四分之一的人口，过着在最低的福利预算标准以下的生活”。这是纽约州州长哈里曼不久前在一次讲话中承认的。
    有些人只知道美国工人普通都有自己的汽车（甚至房屋），每周实际收入在五、六十元，就认为美国工人生活很“幸福”，而没有看到，这样的收入，在美国社会里，还不足以维持一家的温饱。至于说到汽车，在美国这个工业高度发展的资本主义国家里，除了少数人的豪华的汽车之外，早已不是什么“阔气”的标志，而是日常必需的代步用品了。更何况大部分美国工人家庭的汽车都是用分期付款的方式赊购来的。为要偿清这类债务，不仅需要丈夫和妻子同时能保证全周工作（这在目前各工厂逐月在裁人、企业普遍开工不足的情况下已越来越变得困难了），而且做丈夫的还得加班加点，或在下班以后兼搞副业，每天甚至做十二个小时的工作。一旦遇上各工厂削减生产，那时就会像美国“工人日报”最近在中西部大城市采访的一位记者所述：“你所看到的美国人的面孔就憔悴了。”更不用说是被解雇和失业了。一旦到期债款付不出，不但赊购来的汽车（还有房屋及家庭用具等等）全被公司收回，而且过去已付的钱分文不退。所以，坐这种汽车（住这种房屋，用这种家具），无疑是套上一层镣铐，把工人更紧地束缚在资本家的脚下。　振亚
