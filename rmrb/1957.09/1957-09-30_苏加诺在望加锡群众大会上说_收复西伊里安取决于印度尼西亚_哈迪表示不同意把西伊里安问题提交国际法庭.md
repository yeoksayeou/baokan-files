Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 29th: Indonesian President Sukarno, who is currently inspecting Sulawesi, presided over the opening ceremony of the Fourth Indonesian National Sports Games in Makassar on the afternoon of September 28th.

President Sukarno, after arriving in Makassar on the 27th, attended a mass meeting held locally with the participation of 100,000 people.

Sukarno said at the meeting that the struggle to recover West Irian does not depend on New York, but on Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 28th: Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister Hardi, who also serves as acting Foreign Minister, told Antara News Agency reporters today that the Indonesian government hopes to recover its territory of West Irian, which is the national aspiration of Indonesia. The government will also grant broad autonomy to the West Irian region in accordance with the principles of a unified state of the Republic of Indonesia.

Hardi criticized the remarks made by Dutch Foreign Minister Luns in Washington on the 25th. He pointed out that Indonesia cannot agree to the Netherlands' suggestion to refer the West Irian issue to the International Court of Justice. He believes that the West Irian issue also involves the security of Southeast Asia, and therefore this issue falls within the purview of the United Nations.

In his remarks on the 25th, Luns said that the United Nations debate on the West Irian issue would not reach any resolution. He described Indonesia's demand to recover West Irian as "a territorial claim by one country against another" and believed that the United Nations could not make a decision on this issue. He even falsely accused Indonesia, saying that if West Irian were incorporated into Indonesian territory, it would be under Indonesia's "colonial rule." He stated that the Netherlands is only willing to negotiate with Indonesia on issues other than the sovereignty of West Irian.

    苏加诺在望加锡群众大会上说
    收复西伊里安取决于印度尼西亚
    哈迪表示不同意把西伊里安问题提交国际法庭
    据新华社雅加达29日电　目前正在苏拉威西视察的印度尼西亚总统苏加诺，9月28日下午在望加锡主持了印度尼西亚第四届全国运动大会的开幕式。
    苏加诺总统在27日到达望加锡以后，参加了当地举行的有十万人参加的群众大会。
    苏加诺在会上讲话说，收复西伊里安的斗争不是取决于纽约，而是取决于印度尼西亚。
    新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚兼任代理外交部长的第一副总理哈迪今天对安塔拉通讯社记者说，印度尼西亚政府希望收回自己的领土西伊里安，这是印度尼西亚的民族愿望。政府并且将会根据印度尼西亚共和国的统一国家的原则，给予西伊里安地区以广泛的自治。
    哈迪批评了荷兰外交大臣伦斯25日在华盛顿发表的谈话。他指出，印度尼西亚不能同意荷兰的关于把西伊里安问题提到国际法庭上去的建议，他认为西伊里安问题也牵涉到东南亚安全的问题，因此，这个问题是属于联合国权限之内的问题。
    伦斯在25日的谈话中说，联合国对西伊里安问题的辩论，是不会达成什么解决的。他把印度尼西亚收回西伊里安的要求说成是“一个国家提出的对另一个国家的领土要求”，并且认为联合国不可以就这个问题作出决定。他甚至反过来诬蔑印度尼西亚说，如果西伊里安并入印度尼西亚版图，它是处在印度尼西亚的“殖民统治”下。他表示荷兰只愿意同印度尼西亚谈判西伊里安主权问题以外的问题。
