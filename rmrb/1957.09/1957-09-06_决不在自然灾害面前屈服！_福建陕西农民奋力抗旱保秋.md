    Absolutely Refuse to Yield to Natural Disasters!
    Fujian and Shaanxi Peasants Strive to Fight Drought and Protect Autumn Harvest
    (Our Report) Fujian Province farmers are actively engaged in the anti-drought and autumn harvest protection movement, striving to increase production in autumn fields. Since mid-August, the province has generally lacked rain, and the water levels of streams and rivers have continued to decline, with the drought intensifying rapidly. According to statistics from relevant departments on August 26, the drought-affected area in the province has reached more than 3,191,000 mu. The Jinjiang Special District is the most severely affected, with a drought-affected area of more than 1,655,000 mu. In severely drought-affected areas, the land is cracked, and crop growth is poor. In order to overcome the drought, the Fujian Provincial Headquarters for Drought Resistance and Prevention (led by Wei Jinshui, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor) issued an emergency notice a few days ago, requiring all localities to take swift measures to stop the drought from developing. Currently, approximately several million people are engaged in the fight against drought and to protect the autumn harvest every day. In Nan'an County, which is severely affected by the drought, more than 270,000 people are mobilized every day, using more than 10,000 waterwheels, more than 70 pumping machines, and more than 35,000 water bailers to fight the drought. Currently, more than 250,000 mu of drought-affected crops have been irrigated from one to six times, accounting for 96.4% of the total drought-affected area. Jiaotang Township, which has poor water conservancy conditions, organized a water-carrying team of more than 600 people, carrying water from more than two miles away every day to irrigate 150 mu of drought-affected late rice. They put forward the slogan "Resist until the streams dry up and there is no spring water, and still find ways to find water to irrigate and ensure a bumper harvest." In Lian Tang and other townships in Jinjiang, gas lamps are lit every night to fight the drought and protect the seedlings. According to preliminary statistics from the Jinjiang and Nanping Special Districts, more than 668,000 mu of dry land have been irrigated.
    (Our Report) Party and government leading departments at all levels in Shaanxi Province are actively organizing the masses to carry out the anti-drought and autumn harvest protection movement.
    Most areas of Shaanxi Province have not had rain for a long time, and varying degrees of drought have appeared in autumn fields. In the Guanzhong Plain, autumn fields are generally threatened by drought. Party and government leading departments at all levels have taken emergency measures to deal with the current drought, dispatching a large number of cadres to go deep into the grassroots, to promote the anti-drought and autumn harvest protection movement. All counties have dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside and work with the peasants, trying every possible means to find water sources, using canals, waterwheels and carrying water, etc., to irrigate the autumn fields. According to statistics, canals have already irrigated several million mu of autumn fields, and the corn and rice in the irrigated areas have been watered once or twice. Sanyuan County launched an anti-drought movement throughout the county. All 117,900 mu of cotton and 58,000 mu of corn in the Jinghui and Qinghui Canal irrigation areas have been watered once, and some have been watered twice. All localities are actively exploring all feasible methods, some using flood irrigation, some adding waterwheels and windlasses, and some carrying water for spot irrigation, "irrigate as much as possible, irrigate as many mu as possible," to fight drought and protect the autumn harvest with all their strength.

    决不在自然灾害面前屈服！
    福建陕西农民奋力抗旱保秋
    本报讯　福建省农民积极投入抗旱保秋运动，力争秋田增产。8月中旬以来，全省普遍缺雨，溪河水位不断下降，旱情猛烈发展。据有关部门8月26日统计，全省受旱面积已达三百十九万一千多亩。其中尤以晋江专区旱情为最严重，全区受旱面积达一百六十五万五千多亩。在受旱严重地区，土地龟裂，作物生长不良。为了战胜干旱，福建省抗旱防旱指挥部（省委书记、副省长魏金水领导）已于日前发出了紧急通知，要求各地迅速采取措施制止旱情发展。现在，每天约有数百万人投入抗旱保秋斗争。受旱严重的南安县，每天出动二十七万多人，使用着一万多架水车，七十多部抽水机，和三万五千多件戽水工具，同干旱作斗争。现在，已有二十五万多亩受旱作物受到一次到六次的灌溉，占受旱总面积的96.4％。该县水利条件较差的焦塘乡，组织了一支六百多人的挑水队，连日到二里路外挑水，灌溉受旱的一百五十亩晚稻。他们提出了“抗到溪干无泉水，还要想法找水灌溉保丰收”的口号。晋江莲塘等乡每夜点着汽灯抗旱保苗。据晋江、南平两专区初步统计，已有六十六万八千多亩旱田得到灌溉。
    本报讯　陕西省各级党、政领导部门积极组织广大群众开展抗旱保秋运动。
    陕西大部地区很久没有落雨，秋田出现了程度不同的干旱现象。在关中平原地区，秋田普遍受到旱灾的威胁。各级党、政领导部门，对当前的干旱现象采取了紧急措施，抽调大批干部深入基层，推动抗旱保秋运动。各县都抽调了大批干部深入农村和农民一起，千方百计，寻找水源，利用水渠、水车和担水等，浇灌秋田。据统计，渠道已浇秋田几百万亩，灌溉地区的玉米，水稻已浇一遍到两遍。三原县全县展开抗旱运动，泾惠、清惠渠灌区的十一万七千九百多亩棉花，和五万八千多亩玉米，全部浇过一遍，有一部分已浇二遍。各地都积极挖掘一切可行的办法，有的利用洪水灌溉，有的添置水车、辘轳，有的担水点浇，“能浇一分是一分，能灌一亩是一亩”，全力抗旱保秋。
