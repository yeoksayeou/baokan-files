Xinhua News Agency special dispatch, reporters Mo Ai, Li Feng, and Lei Runming report: According to incomplete statistics, in the past two weeks, more than 117,000 employees in more than 40 state-owned factories and mines in the capital have posted more than 110,000 big-character posters, expressing opinions on production management, cadre style, wages and benefits in factories and mines, and some issues in national life.

Since the comprehensive launch of the rectification movement, big-character posters have consistently become the main form for the broad masses of employees to engage in great blooming and contending in state-owned factories and mines in the capital. The mines under the Jingsi Mining Bureau, with nearly 20,000 employees, posted 15,000 big-character posters in a week, and the average employee of the Liulihe Cement Plant posted 1.3 big-character posters. Now, various colored big-character posters are posted on many buildings other than production workshops in state-owned factories and mines. Many factories and mines have also used waste reed mats and wooden boards to build long "blooming and contending gardens." Readers in front of the big-character posters are often shoulder to shoulder. Here, there are not only employees from this factory or mine, but also members of the Party Central Committee, ministers of the government, and generals of the People's Liberation Army.

The big-character posters include short essays, poems, cartoons, as well as comic dialogues and ballads. Among them, the number of big-character posters related to suggestions for doing a good job in increasing production and practicing economy and criticism is the largest. A big-character poster from the Beijing State-Owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory criticizing the leadership for not paying attention to increasing production and practicing economy said: "The supply of steel is very tight, and saving cotton cloth resounds through the clouds. The No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory is simply wasteful. Why are the good white iron sheet bobbin boxes discarded in the scrap yard and new canvas ones must be bought? Why is this? Whose responsibility is it?" A big-character poster jointly signed by Zhu Fucheng and nine others from the factory suggested concentrating technical forces to establish a production technology section. The big-character poster said that there are no less than several hundred technical cadres in our factory, but they are scattered due to too many levels. We should reduce the levels and concentrate the use of technical forces, which will greatly improve production. Zhou Chaoding and Zhang Zong? from the Labor Organization Section of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant said in a big-character poster titled "Why Recruit So Many People": Last year, after the factory received news of expansion in the second quarter, the factory leadership subjectively decided to submit a report to the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to recruit 1,100 people. The Iron and Steel Bureau received this report, did not review it carefully, and bureaucratically approved it with a stroke of the pen. In fact, according to the design plan at the time, there was no basis at all for needing to train 1,100 people last year. Fortunately, the demand for labor in society was tight at the time, and only more than 500 people were recruited, otherwise it would have brought greater waste to the country and the enterprise. The wages alone would cost 660,000 yuan a year. Big-character posters like this, which propose suggestions and criticisms on production and management, account for about 35% of the total number of big-character posters in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

On average, about 25% of the big-character posters in each factory criticize the bad work style of party member cadres. The employees of the State-Owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory sharply criticized the bureaucratic style of the leading cadres who were high above. A big-character poster titled "Who is Our Organization Minister?" criticized the Party Committee Organization Minister of the factory for being high above, and as a result, many people did not know him at all more than two years after the factory started operations. Six units including the boiler room of this factory criticized the factory director and Party Committee secretary for rarely going there, and even when they went to the workshop, they "just slipped through."

In addition, about 25% of the big-character posters put forward opinions on issues such as wages, bonuses, and welfare. In the past few days, some thought-provoking issues have emerged in these types of big-character posters. Zhi Shigang, a young odd-job worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, suffered from severe lung disease before liberation. After liberation, he recuperated in hospitals and sanatoriums for six or seven years. During this period, in addition to paying 60% of his salary every month, the state successively spent a total of 18,000 yuan on medical expenses. After he was discharged from the hospital last year, the factory assigned him to do lighter gatekeeping work in order to take care of his health. This time, he wrote a big-character poster titled "Save Me, Leaders," asking the factory leaders to save him and let him learn technology. He believes that gatekeeping work has no future. Similar big-character posters written by some young workers are not isolated cases in various factories and mines. A big-character poster from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, signed Shaohua, wrote: Last year, the average welfare expenses for each person in the factory was 303 yuan, while the average for employees living in the factory's family dormitories was 380 yuan, for those living in the factory's single dormitories it was 202 yuan, for employees renting houses in the city it was 203 yuan, and for those living in their own houses it was 194 yuan. Therefore, many employees want to move into the factory's dormitories. Some employees who own property rent it out or sell it, or leave it idle, or even let it collapse and intentionally demolish and damage it in order to ask the factory for housing. Shaohua suggested in the big-character poster that the rent in the factory should be raised to the standard of the rent in the city.

A small number of big-character posters also put forward some different views on the country's political life.

Now, in factories and mines that have generally entered the stage of comprehensive rectification for more than ten days, the number of big-character posters posted every day is gradually decreasing. The Party committees of these factories and mines have realized that the broad masses of employees are currently focusing on how the Party committees of each factory and mine will handle the opinions they have put forward. In accordance with the spirit of rectifying while correcting, the Party committees of each factory and mine, in addition to successively handling some issues that can be resolved immediately during the blooming and contending process, are now further studying each issue raised by the masses of employees in big-character posters, forums, and group meetings, and preparing to resolve another batch of the easier to solve problems in the near future.

    北京厂矿企业大鸣大放中证明：
    大字报是推动整风的良好形式
    绝大多数的意见对改进工作有很大意义
    本报特约新华社专稿　记者莫艾、李峰、雷润明报道：据不完全统计，在过去两周内，首都四十多个国营厂矿企业的十一万七千多职工已贴出十一万多张大字报，就厂矿中的生产管理、干部作风、工资福利和国家生活中的一些问题发表意见。
    首都各国营厂矿中的党组织自全面开展整风运动以来，大字报就一直成为职工群众大鸣大放的主要形式。有近两万职工的京西矿务局所属各矿在一周内贴出了一万五千张大字报，琉璃河水泥厂平均每个职工贴了一点三张大字报。现在各国营厂矿生产车间以外的许多建筑物上，都张贴了各种颜色的大字报，很多厂矿并利用废旧芦苇席、木板搭成长龙式的报棚，作为“鸣放园地”。大字报前的读者经常项臂相接，这里不仅有本厂矿的职工，还有党中央的委员，政府的部长，人民解放军的将军。
    大字报上有短文，有诗歌，有漫画，也有相声和鼓词。其中以有关搞好增产节约的建议和批评性的大字报数量最多。北京国营第二棉纺织厂有一张批评领导不重视增产节约的大字报说：“钢铁供应十分紧张，节约棉布响彻云霄，国棉二厂偏偏浪费，好好的白铁皮筒管箱为什么甩到废料库不用，又非要买帆布作新的不可，这是为什么？谁的责任？”该厂朱富澄等十人联名的一张大字报建议集中技术力量，成立生产技术科。大字报说，我们厂技术干部不下几百人，但因层次太多，都分散了。应减少层次，集中使用技术力量，这会对生产的改进起很大的作用。石景山钢铁厂劳动组织科周朝鼎和张宗?在“为啥招这么多人”的一张大字报里说：去年第二季度当本厂得到扩建消息以后，厂的领导上就主观地决定向冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局提出要招收一千一百人的报告，钢铁局接到这个报告，没有很好审查，就官僚主义地大笔一挥“批准”了。实际上，根据当时的设计方案，根本找不出去年需要培养一千一百人的根据。幸亏当时社会上劳动力的需要情况紧张，只招收了五百多人，否则将给国家和企业带来更大的浪费，只工资一项，一年就要支出六十六万元。像这类对生产、管理提出建议和批评的大字报，在石景山钢铁厂占大字报总数的35％左右。
    平均各厂大约有25％左右的大字报对党员干部中不好的工作作风提出了批评。国营北京第一棉纺织厂的职工对领导干部高高在上的官僚主义批评得很尖锐，有一张“我们的组织部长是谁？”的大字报，批评该厂党委组织部长因高高在上，工厂开工两年多，结果很多人根本不认识他。这个厂锅炉房等六个单位批评厂长党委书记很少到他们那里去，即是到车间也是“一溜就过去了”。
    另外约有25％左右的大字报对工资、奖励、生活福利等方面的问题提出了意见。最近几天内，在这类大字报中出现了一些值得令人深思的问题。石景山发电厂青年杂工支士刚解放前患严重肺病，解放后在医院、休养所疗养了六、七年，在这期间国家除按月付给60％的薪金外，先后支出的医疗费用共有一万八千元。去年出院后工厂为了照顾他的身体，分配他做工作比较轻便的看门工作，这次他在大字报上以“救一救我吧——领导”为题，要求工厂领导上救一救他，让他学技术，他认为做看门工作没有前途。和这性质相类似的某些青年工人写的大字报，在各个厂矿并非个别的。石景山钢铁厂一张署名绍华的大字报上写道：去年全厂福利费平均每人三百零三元，而住本厂家属宿舍的职工每人平均是三百八十元，住本厂单身宿舍的是二百零二元，在市内租房住的职工是二百零三元，住自己房的是一百九十四元。因此很多职工都想搬到工厂的宿舍来住。有的职工自己有房产，也把它出租或卖掉，或空闲起来，甚至任其倒塌，故意拆除损坏，以便向工厂要房子住。绍华在大字报上建议，将厂内的房租提高到市内的房租标准。
    少数大字报对国家的政治生活也提出了一些各不相同的看法。
    现在，一般进入全面整风已逾一旬的厂矿，每天贴出的大字报已在逐步下降。这些厂矿的党委已经觉察到：广大职工的眼光，目前正在注视着各厂矿党委如何处理他们所提出的意见。各厂矿的党委根据边整边改的精神，除在鸣放过程中已陆续处理了一些可以立即处理的问题外，现在正在进一步就职工群众在大字报和座谈会、小组会上所提出的各种问题，逐件进行研究，准备在最近时期内，再将其中较易解决的一批问题，立即加以解决。
