　　Cold Arrows Couldn't Shoot Her Down
　　In May, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee Cultural School began to air views. To help the Party in its rectification campaign, a female teacher, Wang Xianliang, had kindly criticized a Party member at a meeting for not connecting with the masses and trusting them enough. Rightists immediately distorted and exaggerated this, even using her name on big-character posters to attack the Party, falsely accusing this Party member of treating comrades "as if they were secret agents."
　　The rightists in the school frantically coerced the masses to jointly attack the Party. They exaggerated the shortcomings of individual Party members, questioned the Party organization, and slandered the Party's principles of building the Party. Wang Xianliang felt their movements were suspicious and refused to sign. As a result, she was met with a barrage of cold arrows from the rightists. Many satirical doggerels appeared on the wall newspapers. The rightists also specially sent people to have individual talks with Wang Xianliang, "enlightening" her, dispelling her "concerns," and "mobilizing" her to speak out.
　　Why did the rightists constantly put pressure on her and eagerly incite her to "speak out?" It turned out they were trying to find materials from her to attack the Party.
　　To win over the masses and incite their dissatisfaction with the Party, the rightists made a big fuss about the wage reform. The wage reform working group consisted of five people: Party, Youth League, and teacher representatives. Wang Xianliang was a teacher representative. Under the instigation of the rightists, two representatives had already echoed that the wage reform was not democratic. The rightists believed that as long as Wang Xianliang also echoed this, they could win over the "majority" and attack the Party boldly.
　　When various hints and pressures against Wang Xianliang still did not achieve their goal, the rightists used a big-character poster to write an "open letter to Representative Wang Xianliang" to threaten her, saying that she "knew the inside story" and urging her to "break through personal relationships" and not "remain silent."
　　At this time, Wang Xianliang could no longer endure it. Was there really some unspeakable "inside story?"
　　She knew that the debate here was no longer about whether one person's salary was more or less, but that the rightists were attempting to use this as one of the pieces of evidence that the Party was undemocratic in order to attack the Party. Therefore, she launched a public counterattack. In the open letter, she used concrete facts to explain that last year's wage assessment adopted the principle of combining leadership with the masses, refuting the fallacy of absolute democracy and exposing the essence of the rightists inciting the masses to attack the Party. Thus, the rightists' conspiracy on this issue went bankrupt.
　　Through the anti-Rightist struggle, the true colors of the rightists were exposed very clearly. At that time, she thought they were only seeking personal fame and gain, but now she understood that they were hostile to the Communist Party and hostile to socialism, and were carrying out anti-communist activities with a program, tactics, and steps. She felt that her understanding had greatly improved compared to two months ago. She deeply felt how important it is for a revolutionary worker to truly stand firm on the people's stand!

### 冷箭射不倒她

　　冷箭射不倒她
    5月间，重庆市人民委员会文化学校开始鸣放。为了帮助党整风，女教员王贤良在鸣放会上曾善意地批评一位党员联系群众、信任群众不够。右派分子立刻加以歪曲和夸大，竟在大字报上盗用她的名字对党进行攻击，污蔑这位党员“对同志如对特务”一般。
    学校里的右派分子疯狂地要挟群众联名向党进攻。他们夸大个别党员的缺点，向党组织提出质问，污蔑党的建党方针。王贤良觉得他们的动向可疑，拒绝签名。于是，她遭到右派分子一支支冷箭。墙报上出现了不少讽刺她的打油诗。右派分子还特别派人找王贤良作个别谈话，“启发”她，解除她的“顾虑”，“动员”她放。
    右派分子为什么不断对她施加压力，热中于鼓动她“放”呢？原来，他们企图从她这里找到向党进攻的材料。
    右派分子为了笼络群众，煽动群众对党不满，抓住工资改革大作文章。工资改革工作小组是由党、团、教师代表共五人组成的。王贤良是教师代表。在右派分子煽惑之下，已经有两个代表附和说工资改革不民主。右派分子认为只要王贤良也附和，他们就能争取到了“大多数”，放心大胆向党进攻了。
    当用种种暗示，种种压力对付王贤良还达不到目的的时候，右派分子就利用大字报写了一封“致王贤良代表的公开信”进行威胁，说她“深知内幕”，要她“破除情面”，不要“默尔而息”。
    这时王贤良再也忍耐不住了，难道真有什么不可告人的“内幕”吗？
    她知道现在这儿的争论已经不是那一个人工资多了或少了的问题，是右派分子企图把这事作为党不民主的证据之一，向党进攻。因此，她进行公开反击了，她在公开信里，用具体事实说明去年评薪是采取领导与群众相结合的原则驳斥了绝对民主的谬论，揭穿了右派分子煽动群众向党进攻的实质。这样，右派分子在这个问题上的阴谋破产了。
    经过反右派斗争，右派的面目暴露得很清楚了。当时，她还以为他们仅仅是闹点个人名利，现在才明白，他们敌视共产党，敌视社会主义，是有纲领，有策略，有步骤地进行反共活动的。她觉得自己的认识比两个多月以前大为提高了。她深深感到，真正站稳人民的立场，对一个革命工作者是多么重要！
