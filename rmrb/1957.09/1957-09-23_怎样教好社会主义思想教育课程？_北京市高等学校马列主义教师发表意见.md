How to Teach the Socialist Ideological Education Course Well?
Opinions from Marxist-Leninist Teachers in Beijing Universities

(Our Dispatch) The new academic year has already begun in Beijing's universities. "Socialist Ideological Education Courses" have been universally opened in various schools and grades. How to teach the "Socialist Ideological Education Course" well? Our reporter interviewed political course teachers from some universities in Beijing on this issue. They unanimously expressed their support for the opening of this course and will strive to study Marxism-Leninism, link theory with practice, transform their thinking, and cultivate working-class intellectuals.

**The Course Should be Offered**

Many teachers believe that many problems were exposed among the broad masses of young students during the anti-Rightist struggle. It is timely and necessary to conduct socialist ideological education in response to these problems.

He Ganzhi, a professor at Renmin University of China, said: "I have been teaching political courses for twenty years, from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the present. The characteristic of political courses in schools in the liberated areas in the past was that they started from reality. Teachers would first understand the students' ideological situation before lecturing, and participate in students' group discussions after class, explaining the problems raised by the students. Teachers and students often participated in various practical struggles and production labor.

After liberation, more political courses were offered, and it was necessary to systematically teach Marxism-Leninism. However, there was a tendency to focus on imparting abstract knowledge while neglecting starting from reality. This time, the Party Central Committee is opening the Socialist Ideological Education course in universities to establish a socialist revolutionary outlook and overcome the tendency of dogmatism, which is absolutely necessary. How to teach this course well? I think the first is that teachers must strengthen the transformation of their ideology and consciousness, establish a communist worldview, and earnestly overcome bourgeois individualism. The second is to strengthen the transformation of ideological methods, strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, and pay close attention to linking theory with practice. Teachers must go to the students, participate in their debates, and understand the students' ideological situation as a basis for answering questions during tutoring, overcoming the past tendency of theory being divorced from practice."

Wang Zhen, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said that using class struggle to conduct Marxist-Leninist education for young people is the best way to cultivate their communist outlook on life.

Luo Xin, director of the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office of Beijing Agricultural University, said: "The teachers, students, and staff of universities are undergoing a severe class struggle exercise and test in this rectification and anti-Rightist struggle. However, to pass the socialist test well, we must also make great efforts and conduct a thorough socialist ideological education, which is absolutely necessary."

Yu Shunwu, a teaching assistant at Tsinghua University, said: "In the past, there have been disputes over the teaching principles of political courses. Some believed that Marxist-Leninist theory should be taught systematically, while others believed that theory should be linked with practice to transform thinking. Because of the inconsistent opinions, the teaching effect was also affected. Currently, the central government has decided to open the 'Socialist Ideological Education Course,' which is necessary for both students and teachers."

**Accept Lessons, Improve Teaching**

Teachers feel that although some achievements have been made in the past political course teaching, there are still some shortcomings. Now, we must address the shortcomings in past work and improve the teaching of political courses in the future.

Feng Ding, a professor at Peking University, said: "Political instructors should play a central role in the process of socialist ideological education, and they should go deep into the students to understand their thoughts. Political courses are needed today and will be needed in the future. Political courses should first solve ideological problems. The primary task of political instructors is to help students improve their understanding in politics and ideology. If students maintain erroneous understandings in politics, they cannot become a force for building socialism and may even hinder the socialist cause. If we talk about theory, socialism itself is theory. Chairman Mao's report 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People' is the best theory, it is Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism has developed in this way, starting from reality. Learning political theory and socialist ideological education is not about memorization, but about how to understand the problem. To understand problems deeply, the method of memorization and repetition cannot solve the problem. Adopting the method of debate can inspire students to think about problems and deeply understand them."

Li Mu, a lecturer at Beijing Petroleum Institute, said: "In the past few years of theoretical education, too much attention was paid to the systematicness of lectures. Many teachers spend their main energy on flipping through materials, books, and writing lecture notes, but they do not understand the students' ideological situation and are divorced from reality. These shortcomings must be overcome in the socialist ideological education."

**Educators Must First be Educated**

Many teachers stated that to ensure that the new course of socialist ideological education is taught well, teachers should first strengthen the transformation of their ideological awareness, and educators must first be educated.

Lü Fengju, a lecturer at Beijing Mining Institute, said that as a political course teacher, he is not only someone who educates others, but must first carry out self-transformation so that he can be consistent in word and deed and become a true Party propagandist. Under the call of marching towards science, some teachers have found excuses for the development of individualism, are unwilling to do social work, but are willing to read more books or write articles to prepare for taking the associate doctorate exam; some are even unwilling to participate in the vigorous anti-Rightist struggle. This shows that the bourgeois views of fame and profit still exist among some teachers, so we must be determined to transform ourselves and pass the socialist test well. Only by first transforming ourselves well can we undertake the task of transforming others.

Wang Zhen, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said: "What is more important is that educators must be educated. Here, first of all, we must overcome the past theoretical detachment from reality of some people, the disregard for the work of Party propagandists, and the desire to be a famous and profitable 'theoretician' based on personal reputation and status, which are the decadent bourgeois thoughts. Secondly, we must strive to transform ourselves in our work and change our position."

Rao Weici, a lecturer at Tsinghua University, said that teachers should go to the students and study together, which is a very good exercise opportunity for teachers. In the past, we paid attention to the students' ideological situation, but we neglected the issue of our own ideological transformation.

Kong Lingwen, a lecturer at Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, said that political teachers should wholeheartedly devote themselves to the work of socialist ideological education. In the past teaching work, we did not take the transformation of thinking as the prominent central task of the political course, and we did not understand that linking with reality is for the purpose of transforming thinking. Therefore, in our work, we also neglected to frequently understand the students' ideological situation, and we did not study the reflection and characteristics of the class struggle in society among the students. In the future, we should overcome and correct these shortcomings and make the political education work present a new situation.

    怎样教好社会主义思想教育课程？
    北京市高等学校马列主义教师发表意见
    本报讯　北京市高等学校新学年已经开始了。各学校各年级普遍开设“社会主义思想教育课程”。如何教好“社会主义思想教育课程”？本报记者曾就这个问题访问了北京市一些高等院校的政治课教师。他们一致表示积极拥护开设这门课程，并将努力学习马克思列宁主义，使理论联系实际，改造自己的思想，培养工人阶级知识分子。
    应该开设这门课程
    很多教师认为在反右派斗争时，广大青年学生中暴露出来很多问题，针对这些问题进行社会主义思想教育是适时的也是必要的。
    中国人民大学教授何干之说：从抗战开始到现在二十年的时间中，我一直都在教政治课。过去解放区学校中的政治课的特点是从实际出发，教员讲课前先了解学生的思想情况，课后参加学生的小组讨论会，针对学生提出的问题进行讲解。教员和学生都经常参加各种实际斗争，参加生产劳动。
    解放后，政治课的项目开的多了，注意系统地讲授马克思列宁主义，这是必要的。但是，偏向传授抽象知识，而忽视从实际出发。这次党中央在高等学校中为了树立社会主义革命观和克服教条主义倾向，开设社会主义思想教育课是完全必要的。怎样教好这门课呢？我认为首先是教师们必须加强思想意识的改造，确立共产主义世界观，认真克服资产阶级个人主义。其次是加强思想方法的改造，努力学习马克思列宁主义，密切注意理论联系实际。教师们一定要到学生中间去，参加他们的辩论会，了解学生的思想情况，作为作辅导时解答问题的根据，克服过去理论脱离实际的倾向。
    北京师范大学教授王真说，通过阶级斗争来对青年进行马列主义教育，是培养他们建立共产主义人生观的最好办法。
    北京农业大学马列主义教研室主任罗新说：高等学校的师生员工，在这次整风和反右派斗争中，经受着一种严重的阶级斗争的锻炼和考验。但是要过好社会主义这一关，还必须付出巨大的努力，进行一次深入的社会主义思想教育是完全必要的。
    清华大学助教余顺吾说：过去对政治课的教学方针问题一直都有争论，有的认为应该系统地讲授马克思列宁主义理论，有的则认为要理论联系实际，改造思想。因为意见不一致，也影响了教学效果。目前，中央决定开设“社会主义思想教育课程”，这对学生和教师说来都是必要的。
    接受教训，改进教学
    教师们觉得在过去的政治课教学中，虽然取得了一些成绩，也还存在着一些缺点，现在要针对过去工作中的缺点，改进今后政治课的教学工作。
    北京大学教授冯定说：政治教员在社会主义思想教育过程中要起核心作用，要深入学生中去体会学生的思想。政治课今天需要，将来也还需要。政治课应该首先解决思想问题。政治教员的首要任务是帮助学生在政治思想上提高认识，学生在政治上如保持错误的认识，那么就不能成为建设社会主义的力量，甚至会妨害社会主义事业。如果说讲理论，社会主义本身就是理论，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，就是最好的理论，就是马列主义。马列主义就是这样从实际出发而发展起来的。学习政治理论，社会主义思想教育，不在记忆，而是怎样理解的问题了。要对问题理解得深刻，靠记忆和复述的方法是不能解决问题的。采取辩论的方法，可以启发学生思考问题，深刻地理解问题。
    北京石油学院讲师李木说：过去几年理论教育，过多的注意讲授的系统性。很多教师主要精力用在翻阅材料、书籍、写讲稿等等，却不去了解学生的思想情况，脱离实际。这些缺点要在进行社会主义思想教育中予以克服。
    教育者必先受教育
    很多教师表示：为了保证教好社会主义思想教育这门新课程，教师们应该首先加强思想意识的改造，教育者必先受教育。
    北京矿业学院讲师吕凤举说，作为政治课的教员，他不仅是教育别人的人，而且必须首先进行自我改造，使自己能够言行一致，成为真正的党的宣传员。教师在向科学进军的号召下，有些人为个人主义的发展找借口，不愿干社会工作，而愿多念些书，或写写文章，为考取副博士准备条件；有的甚至不愿参加轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争。这都说明了资产阶级的名利观点在部分教师中还存在着，这就要下定决心改造自己，过好社会主义这一关。只有首先自我改造好了，才能担负起改造别人的任务。
    北京师范大学教授王真说：更重要的是教育者必须受教育，这里，首先要克服一部分人过去理论不联系实际，轻视党的宣传员工作，以个人名誉地位出发，妄想作有名有利的“理论家”的腐朽的资产阶级思想。其次，必须努力在工作中改造自己，改变立场。
    清华大学讲师饶慰慈说，教师要到学生中间去，一块学习，这对教师们是一个很好的锻炼机会。过去对学生的思想情况还是注意的，但对自己的思想改造问题却忽略了。
    北京航空学院讲师孔令闻说，政治教师们应该全心全意投入社会主义思想教育这一工作。在过去的教学工作中，没有把改造思想作为政治课的突出的工作中心，不了解联系实际就是为了改造思想。因此，在工作中也忽略了经常了解学生的思想状况，对于社会上的阶级斗争在学生中的反映及其特点没有进行研究。今后应该克服和纠正这些缺点，使政治教育工作出现一个新局面。
