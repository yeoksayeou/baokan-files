Fuzhou Dispatch: The mountain areas of Fujian Province are actively carrying out a campaign to eliminate pests and protect the autumn harvest. Currently, autumn crops are about to mature, and wild animals frequently come out to ravage crops and livestock. According to recent statistics from eleven counties in the Nanping Special District, the area of autumn crops damaged has reached more than 47,000 mu, more than double that of the same period last year. Among them, in the four counties of Taining, Jianyang, Shaowu, and Guangze alone, the loss of millet due to animal damage has recently reached about 143,000 jin. In Yongtai and Datian counties, more than 1.4 million sweet potato plants have been eaten by wild boars, seriously affecting farmers' production. In order to ensure a bumper autumn harvest, the Fujian Provincial People's Committee issued instructions a few days ago, requesting relevant departments to immediately lead farmers in mountainous areas to quickly eliminate wild animals. At present, hunting teams, animal defense stations and other animal prevention and elimination organizations have been generally established in various counties in mountainous areas. For example, in the Nanping Special District, more than 6,400 people have organized more than 600 hunting teams. In Badu District of Ningde County, thirteen hunting teams were organized, seventy-five animal defense towers were built, and nearly four hundred people went deep into the dense forests day and night, rain or shine, to capture wild animals. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-nine counties including Dehua, Yongchun, and Hua'an, more than 3,400 wild animals of various kinds have been killed since August, and farmers in Shaxian County have killed three tigers.

    福建山区除兽保秋
    本报福州电　福建省山区积极开展除兽保秋运动。目前秋季作物即将成熟，野兽经常出来残害庄稼和牲畜。据南平专区十一个县最近的统计，秋收作物受害面积达四万七千多亩，比去年同期扩大一倍多。其中仅泰宁、建阳、邵武、光泽四县，近来遭受兽害损失的谷子约达十四万三千多斤。永泰、大田两县有一百四十多万株番薯被山猪吃掉，严重影响农民生产。为了保障秋季丰收，福建省人民委员会已于日前发出指示，要求有关部门立即领导山区农民迅速扑灭野兽。目前山区各县已普遍组织了打猎队、防兽站等防兽除兽机构。如南平专区共有六千四百多人组织了六百多个打猎队。宁德县八都区组织了十三个打猎队，盖了七十五座防兽楼，近四百人不分昼夜晴雨地深入密林捕捉野兽。据德化、永春、华安等二十九县的不完全统计，8月份以来已打死了各种野兽三千四百多头，沙县农民捕杀了三只老虎。
