Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Trade Unions
Liu Shihua, Secretary of the Party Committee of the 53rd Factory

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the trade union of the 53rd Factory has done a lot of work in strengthening the political and ideological education of workers, in leading the development of socialist competitions, in carrying out mass supervision, supervising the enterprise administration to conscientiously implement government policies and laws, resolutely safeguarding the interests of the country, and fighting against various phenomena that disregard the legitimate interests of the masses. Facts have proved that the Party's mass work in enterprises is mainly the leadership of trade unions and the Communist Youth League, especially the leadership of trade unions. If the work of the trade union is done well, it is equivalent to doing a large part of the Party's mass political work well.

An extremely important issue in the Party's leadership over trade unions at present is to strengthen the Party's leadership over trade unions.

Regarding how to lead the trade union to play a role in mass supervision and how to combine it well with the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, we have the following experiences:

I. Educate cadres and unify understanding. In our factory, not everyone understood the significance of trade union supervision from the beginning. Some administrative cadres, due to the influence of one-sided emphasis on the "one-chief system," had commandism and neglected the lives of workers in their work, failed to respect the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the trade union, and were unwilling to hear the term "trade union supervision," causing dissatisfaction among trade union cadres. On the other hand, trade union cadres did not fully understand the significance of trade union supervision, placing most of the supervision activities on the aspects of workers' lives and welfare: paying less attention to various economic activities of the enterprise, checking more on the shortcomings of the administration; showing less consideration for the difficulties of the administration and helping the administration mobilize the masses to propose improvement methods, and sometimes even having grievances and confrontational emotions. In response to these thoughts, the Party committee, on the one hand, educated administrative cadres to conscientiously implement the mass line and correctly understand and accept mass supervision; on the other hand, it required the trade union to supervise not only the lives of workers and labor protection, but also the production and economic activities of the enterprise, to ensure better completion of the national plan. At the same time, the Party committee emphasized that "supervision" and "guarantee" should not be separated. When discovering shortcomings in the administrative leadership of the enterprise, it is necessary to mobilize workers to propose specific improvement methods. In short, it is necessary to enable all cadres to implement the principle of combining national interests with personal interests in their thinking, establish a comprehensive thinking, and prevent one-sidedness.

II. The Party organization must strengthen specific leadership over the trade union organization in practical activities. First, it is necessary to point out the direction to the trade union, so that it can carry out supervision activities in a planned and led manner, and act in accordance with the Party's policies and national laws. In addition to making systematic special inspections of the trade union in the work plan, the Party committee requires the trade union to go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, and actively conduct various special investigations based on the current problems. If the trade union conducts systematic and in-depth investigations and research on special topics in a planned and led manner and proposes solutions to the problems, the problems will be solved more thoroughly. Second, in the daily activities of the enterprise, the Party organization should give strong support to the correct criticisms and suggestions from the masses and launch a struggle against bad tendencies that disregard the opinions of the masses and suppress mass criticism.

III. The main method for the Party to lead the trade union to carry out mass supervision is to improve and expand democracy in enterprise management and attract the masses to participate in enterprise management. In the past, the organizational forms for attracting workers to participate in enterprise management in our factory included worker representative meetings, workshop worker meetings, production meetings, and competition evaluation meetings. In April of this year, the standing worker representative congress was implemented, and the workshop worker meetings were improved on the basis of the past.

The Party committee's leadership of the worker representative congress paid attention to the following two tasks:

(1) Strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership from beginning to end.

What kind of worker representative congress should be held and how to use the worker representative congress is the first problem that must be solved. Therefore, with the help of the superior work group, we organized a plan research group to deliberate and prepare. After repeated discussions, the Party committee determined the plan of "changing the original worker representative meeting into a worker representative congress" and clarified the three principles of expanding democracy in enterprise management: ① The democratic rights of workers must be expanded under the leadership of the Party; ② Further give play to the organizational role of the trade union; ③ Take the worker representative congress as the main body, and at the same time improve other forms of mass supervision for workers to participate in enterprise management. At the same time, the central topic of the congress was decided. After unifying the guiding ideology, the organizational regulations of the worker representative congress were formulated, and preparations were made separately.

In order to raise the awareness of the workers and enhance their sense of responsibility as masters, the Party committee led the trade union to understand the ideological sentiments of the workers before the meeting, and extensively and deeply conducted education on improving the enterprise management system and being the masters of the house among cadres and the masses.

Through the trade union, various discussion meetings were organized successively with section chiefs, workshop directors, technicians, foremen, Party and mass cadres, advanced producers, and old and new workers to conduct ideological surveys. Among the administrative cadres, some did not believe in the power of the masses and had resistance to the worker representative congress. Individual cadres said: "Workers do not understand enterprise management knowledge and will ruin the factory." Some cadres were worried that the administrative work would not be easy to carry out because the powers of the worker representative congress were greater than those of the worker representative meeting in the past. Some cadres believed that trade union cadres did not understand technology or economic knowledge and could not be competent for organizing the worker representative congress. Among the workers, some old workers were satisfied with the status quo, saying: "In the old society, we were beaten and scolded, and now we can go anywhere freely, isn't that much better." Therefore, they were not taking a positive attitude towards participating in enterprise management. Some new workers had a tendency towards extreme democracy, believing that there was no democracy in the factory. Some young workers said: "I want to work on an automatic lathe, but the foreman insists on transferring me to a belt lathe, which is not democratic." Some even proposed to change "the lower level obeys the upper level" to "the upper level obeys the lower level." In response to the above-mentioned ideas, a cadre report meeting was held to explain the important significance of the worker representative congress, mobilize all cadres to attach importance to and earnestly implement the policy of relying on the working class to run the enterprise well, and criticize the remaining thoughts of one-sidedly emphasizing the one-chief system. Education on democratic centralism and being the masters of the house was conducted among the workers, emphasizing the relationship between "centralism on the basis of democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralism," and criticizing the tendency of extreme democracy existing among some young workers. After the report, repeated discussions were organized, and all propaganda tools were used to publicize the significance and role of the worker representative congress in a big way. After the above-mentioned education, the cadres strengthened their mass viewpoint and actively participated in the organizational work of the worker representative congress. The workers also improved their awareness and further understood how to be the masters of the house.

Although we conducted various education among cadres and the masses and conducted ideological surveys before the meeting, due to our leadership style not being thorough enough, some ideological problems were not discovered before the meeting, but gradually exposed with the convening of the worker representative congress. For example, after the speeches at the congress began, some administrative cadres of workshops and departments attended the congress with the attitude of being criticized, rectified, or even being defendants. The Party and mass cadres were afraid of hindering the democratic rights of worker representatives and did not dare to intervene in everything, feeling at a loss and not knowing how to lead the activities of worker representatives. Although worker representatives were able to criticize the bureaucracy of the leadership without any worries and expose shortcomings and mistakes, many representatives did not understand the significance and role of the worker representative congress and how to be the masters of the house deeply and comprehensively enough, believing that being a representative was only to convey opinions, and solving problems was the responsibility of the leadership. Therefore, it was reflected in the meeting that there were more problems raised and less self-criticism; more requests for help and fewer specific solutions proposed. If the above-mentioned ideological confusion is not quickly overcome, it will obviously affect the effect of the meeting. Therefore, under the leadership of the municipal Party committee, we promptly convened the Party committee to carry out criticism and self-criticism, review the problems existing in the previous stage of work, study how to further strengthen leadership, and quickly overcome the ideological confusion among cadres and representatives, guiding the congress to develop in a healthy and correct direction, and ensuring that the meeting achieved the expected purpose.

After the worker representative congress closed, the Party committee promptly discussed the post-meeting work, publicized the spirit and resolutions of the congress to all workers, and led the trade union to organize worker representatives to check the implementation of the resolutions, ensuring the smooth implementation of the congress resolutions.

(2) Pay attention to giving play to the role of the trade union organization in the worker representative congress

In the process of convening the worker representative congress, in addition to strengthening the leadership of the Party, the active participation of the administration, and the cooperation of the Communist Youth League, the trade union is in the position of specific leadership and specific organization, and its work is the most. Therefore, in addition to strengthening ideological leadership on issues of principles, policies, and guidelines, the Party committee allows the trade union to do all the specific organizational work of the congress, giving full play to the organizational role of the trade union. Under the leadership of the Party, the trade union actively and proactively conducted education for all workers and made a series of organizational preparations for the congress, ensuring the quality of the meeting. After the meeting, it also supervised and checked the implementation of the resolutions and established a regular contact system with worker representatives.

The workshop worker meeting of our factory was established very early, but before 1954, it was a forum where "cadres speak and workers listen," which only played the role of general mobilization and education. After promoting the experience of the Harbin Railway Factory in holding good branch meetings in 1954, the approach was gradually changed. In addition to reporting work, a certain amount of time was also used to mobilize workers to discuss and make resolutions, so that the worker meeting began to reflect the role of attracting the masses to participate in enterprise management. However, each meeting lasted only two hours, and the time limit affected the better development of democracy, resulting in some formalism. After the implementation of the worker representative congress, in order to implement the resolutions of the worker representative congress and further absorb all workers to participate in enterprise management, the workshop worker meetings were improved and improved in all workshops and departments that undertake certain production tasks throughout the factory.

The result of improving the workshop worker meeting proves that it is an auxiliary organizational form of the worker representative congress and can also be said to be the basis of the worker representative congress. Its main task should be: supervising the implementation of national policies and laws, instructions and orders from superiors, national plans, and resolutions of the worker representative congress by the administrative leaders of the unit; listening to and reviewing the work reports of administrative leaders, and making criticisms and suggestions.

The characteristic of the workshop worker meeting is that the leaders and the masses directly meet, democracy is more widely promoted, and problems are solved more timely and specifically. In this way, it plays an important role in educating and organizing all workers to enhance their sense of responsibility as masters, directly participating in enterprise management, handling internal contradictions of the enterprise, and close the relationship between leaders and the masses.

In short, the Party committee led the trade union to improve the sense of responsibility of all workers as masters, attract the masses to participate in enterprise management, and give play to the role of mass supervision of the trade union through methods such as convening worker representative congresses, workshop worker meetings, production meetings, and competition evaluation meetings. In this way, it helped the administration to promptly discover and overcome shortcomings and errors in leadership work, and continuously improve the work, so as to combine the factory director responsibility system and mass supervision well under the collective leadership of the Party committee.

IV. What should the Party committee do when the administration and the trade union have disputes or disagreements on certain issues in the work of giving play to the role of mass supervision?

We have learned that the fundamental purpose and fundamental tasks of the administration and the trade union are the same, that is, to rely on the masses to do a good job in production, only the division of labor is different. It is not surprising that disputes or disagreements sometimes occur in work due to different perspectives on issues. In the event of this situation, the Party committee should first organize in-depth investigation and research to clarify the problem, and then carefully study the Party's and higher-level decisions and instructions at the Party committee meeting, combine them with reality for discussion, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to distinguish right from wrong and unify understanding. For example, when the trade union inspected welfare work last year, it found that some workers' family members were suffering from tuberculosis or postpartum fever, lying at home without money for treatment, while the factory's medical expenses had a surplus. The trade union suggested that the administration take out the remaining medical expenses to treat the workers' family members who had no money for treatment. The welfare factory director and the comrades of the health section said that they could not use it without instructions from the higher level, and the two sides were deadlocked. The Party committee discussed this issue and believed that a part of the remaining medical expenses could be taken out to treat the family members of workers who were really in difficulty based on the situation of our factory. After the meeting, the health section delayed the implementation of the above-mentioned regulations, and the trade union repeatedly urged it to no avail, and reported the situation to the Party committee. The Party committee immediately consulted with the relevant factory director, cleared up the thinking of the person in charge of the health department, and solved the problem.

In the Party's leadership of the trade union, although we have done some of the above-mentioned work, there are also many shortcomings and errors. There are still many problems that need to be further studied and resolved. For example, after the implementation of the worker representative congress system, how should the various tasks and specific activities of the trade union be connected, how to effectively carry out communist education and improve the class awareness of workers under the new situation, and how to further correctly handle the relationship between the trade union and the administration. Solving these problems will enable the trade union organization to play a greater role and bring the Party's leadership of the trade union to a higher level.

    加强党对工会的领导
    中共五三工厂党委书记　刘诗华
    几年来，五三工厂工会在党的领导下，在加强职工政治思想教育方面，在领导开展社会主义竞赛方面，在开展群众监督工作，监督企业行政认真贯彻政府的政策法令，坚决地维护国家的利益并向各种漠视群众正当利益的现象作斗争等方面，作了很多工作。事实证明，党在企业里的群众工作主要是对工会与青年团的领导工作，特别是对工会的领导。工会的工作做好了，就等于党的群众政治工作做好了一大部分。
    党对工会的领导在当前的一个十分重要的问题，就是加强党对工会的领导。
    如何领导工会发挥群众监督作用，并和党委领导下的厂长负责制很好地结合起来，我们有如下的几点体会：
    一．教育干部，统一认识。在我们厂里，不是所有的人从一开始就明确地了解工会监督的意义的。某些行政干部由于受了片面强调“一长制”的影响，工作中有命令主义和忽视职工生活的现象，不能够很好地尊重工会提出的批评和建议，并且不愿意听“工会监督”的提法，造成了工会干部的不满。另一方面，工会干部没有全面理解工会监督的意义，把监督活动大部分放在职工生活福利方面：注意企业各项经济活动少，检查行政缺点多；体贴行政困难并协助行政发动群众提出改进办法少，有时还有埋怨对立情绪。党委针对这些思想，一方面教育行政干部认真贯彻群众路线，正确地理解与接受群众监督；另一方面要求工会既要监督职工生活和劳动保护，也要监督企业生产经济活动，保证更好地完成国家计划。同时，党委强调不要把“监督”和“保证”分开，在发现企业行政领导上的缺点时，要发动职工提出具体改进办法。总之，要使所有干部在思想上贯彻国家利益与个人利益相结合的原则，树立全面思想，防止片面性。
    二．党的组织必须在实际活动中加强对工会组织的具体领导。首先是给工会指出方向，使它有领导有计划地开展监督活动，并按党的政策和国家的法令办事。党委除了在工作计划中对工会提出要求作系统的专题检查外，更要求工会深入群众、深入实际，经常不断地根据当前存在的问题，主动进行各种专题调查。工会有计划有领导地对专题进行系统地深入地调查研究，并提出解决问题的办法，会使问题解决得较为彻底。其次是党组织在企业的日常活动中，对来自群众的正确批评、建议予以大力支持，并向漠视群众意见、压制群众批评的不良倾向展开斗争。
    三．党领导工会开展群众监督的主要方法，是健全与扩大企业管理的民主，吸引群众参加企业管理。过去我厂吸引职工群众参加企业管理的组织形式有职工代表会议、车间职工大会、生产会议和竞赛评比会议等，今年4月推行了常任的职工代表大会并在过去的基础上改进了车间的职工大会。
    党委对职工代表大会的领导注意了下面的两个工作：
    （1）自始至终加强党的政治思想领导。
    召开什么样的职工代表大会，究竟怎样运用职工代表大会，这是首先必须解决的问题。因此，我们在上级工作组的帮助下，组织了方案研究小组酝酿准备，经过反复讨论，党委确定了“将原有的职工代表会议改为职工代表大会”的方案，并明确了扩大企业管理工作中的民主的三条原则：①必须在党的领导下扩大职工的民主权利；②进一步发挥工会的组织作用；③以职工代表大会为主，同时健全职工参加企业管理的其他群众监督形式。同时，决定了大会的中心议题。在统一领导思想后，即制定了职工代表大会的组织条例，并分头做好准备工作。
    为了提高职工群众的觉悟，增强职工群众的主人翁责任感，党委在会前领导工会了解职工思想情绪，在干部和群众中广泛深入地进行了健全企业管理制度和当家作主的教育。
    通过工会先后组织了科长、车间主任、技术人员、工长、党群干部、先进生产者和新老工人的各种座谈会，进行思想摸底。在行政干部中，有的不相信群众的力量，对于职工代表大会有抵触情绪。个别干部说：“工人不懂企业管理知识，会把工厂搞垮的。”还有一些干部听说职工代表大会比过去职工代表会议的职权大了，担心行政工作不好搞。有些干部认为工会干部一不懂技术，二不懂经济知识，不能胜任组织职工代表大会的任务。在工人中，部分老工人满足现状，他们说：“在旧社会挨打受骂，现在到处可以自由，那不是强多了。”因此对参加企业管理不是抱着积极的态度。部分新工人中有极端民主的倾向，他们认为工厂没有民主。有的青工说：“我愿在自动床上干活，工长偏调我到皮带床上去，这是不民主的。”甚至有的提出要把“下级服从上级”改为“上级服从下级”。针对上述思想，召开干部报告会，讲解了职工代表大会的重要意义，动员全体干部重视并切实贯彻依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针，批判了片面强调一长制的残余思想。在职工中进行了民主集中制和当家作主的教育，强调了“民主基础上的集中，集中指导下的民主”的关系，并批判了在部分青工中存在的极端民主的倾向。报告后组织反复讨论，并利用一切宣传工具，大张旗鼓地宣传了职工代表大会的意义与作用。经过上述教育后，干部加强了群众观点，积极参加了职工代表大会的组织工作。工人也提高了觉悟，进一步懂得了如何当家作主。
    会前我们虽在干部及群众中进行了各种教育，进行了思想调查，由于我们的领导作风还不够深入，有些思想问题在会前没有发现，却随着职工代表大会的召开逐渐地暴露出来。如在大会发言开始后，部分车间、科室行政干部抱着受批评挨整甚至当被告的态度参加大会，党群干部则怕妨碍职工代表的民主权利，事事不敢过问，束手束脚，晕头转向，不知如何领导职工代表的活动。职工代表虽然能够毫无顾虑地批评领导上的官僚主义，揭发缺点与错误，但不少代表对职工代表大会的意义、作用及如何当家作主，还了解得不够深刻与全面，认为当代表仅是传达意见，解决问题则是领导上的事。因此，表现在会议上提出问题多，自我批评少；伸手要的多，提出具体办法少。上述思想上的混乱如不很快克服，很显然地要影响会议的效果，因此在市委的领导下，我们及时地召开党委会开展批评和自我批评，检查前一段工作中存在的问题，研究如何进一步加强领导，迅速地克服了干部及代表中的思想混乱现象，引导大会向健康正确的方向发展，保证了会议达到预期的目的。
    职工代表大会闭幕后，党委会及时地讨论了会后工作，向全体职工宣传了大会的精神和决议，领导工会组织职工代表检查决议执行情况。保证了大会决议的顺利贯彻。
    （2）注意发挥工会组织在职工代表大会中的作用
    在召开职工代表大会的过程中，除了加强党的领导、行政积极参加和青年团配合外，工会处在具体领导与具体组织的地位，它的工作最多。因此，党委除了在方针、政策、原则问题上加强思想领导外，大会的一切具体的组织工作统统放手让工会去做，充分地发挥工会的组织作用。工会在党的领导下，积极主动地向全体职工进行了教育，并且为大会做好了一系列组织准备工作，保证了会议的质量。会后还监督和检查决议的贯彻执行，与职工代表建立经常的联系制度。
    我厂车间职工大会很早就建立了，但在1954年以前，是“干部讲，工人听”的讲坛，仅仅起了一般动员教育的作用。1954年在推行哈尔滨铁路工厂开好支部大会的经验后，逐渐地改变了作法，除报告工作外，还要用一定时间发动工人讨论，做出决议，这样就使职工大会开始体现了吸引群众参加企业管理的作用。但是每次开会时间仅两个小时，由于时间的限制影响了民主的更好发扬，产生了某些形式主义的现象。在推行职工代表大会后，为了贯彻职工代表大会决议，进一步吸收全体职工参加企业管理，在全厂各车间及担负一定生产任务的科室中改进与健全了车间职工大会。
    健全车间职工大会的结果，证明它是职工代表大会的辅助组织形式，同时也可以说是职工代表大会的基础。它的主要任务应该是：监督本单位行政领导对国家政策法令、上级指示、命令、国家计划和职工代表大会决议的执行；听取和审查行政领导者的工作报告，并且提出批评与建议。
    车间职工大会的特点是，领导和全体群众直接见面，发扬民主更加广泛，解决问题更加及时具体。这样，它就在教育组织全体职工提高主人翁责任感，直接参加企业管理，处理企业内部矛盾，密切领导与群众之间的联系，起了重要作用。
    总之，党委领导工会通过召开职工代表大会、车间职工大会、生产会议、竞赛评比会议等方法，提高了全体职工的主人翁责任感，吸引群众参加企业管理，发挥了工会的群众监督作用。这样就协助行政及时发现与克服领导工作中的缺点和错误，不断地改进工作，从而在党委集体领导下把厂长负责制和群众监督很好地结合起来。
    四．在发挥群众监督作用的工作中行政与工会在某些问题上遇有争执或不一致的时候，党委应该怎么办？
    我们体会，行政与工会的根本目的和根本任务是一致的，都是依靠群众搞好生产，只是分工不同。由于看问题的角度不同，有时在工作中发生争执或意见不一致是不奇怪的。遇有这种情况，党委首先要组织深入的调查研究，弄清问题，然后在党委会上认真学习党与上级的决定、指示，结合实际进行讨论，开展批评与自我批评，以明辨是非，统一认识。如去年工会检查福利工作时，发现有些职工家属患有结核病或产后热，躺在家里没有钱治病，而厂里的医药费却有结余，工会建议行政把剩余医药费拿出来给无钱治病的职工家属治病，福利厂长和卫生科的同志说上级没指示不能用，双方相持不下。党委会就讨论这个问题，认为根据我厂情况可以拿出剩余医药费的一部分给确实有困难的职工家属看病。会后，卫生科拖延执行上述规定，工会屡次督促无效，向党委反映了情况，党委即找有关厂长商量，打通了卫生部门负责人的思想，解决了问题。
    在党对工会的领导工作中，我们虽作了上述一些工作，但也有不少缺点与错误。还有很多问题需要进一步研究解决。如在推行职工代表大会制度后，工会的各方面工作和具体活动应如何贯串起来，如何在新情况下有效地进行共产主义教育、提高职工的阶级觉悟，如何进一步正确处理工会与行政关系等。解决了这些问题，将使工会组织发挥更大的作用，把党领导工会的工作提到更高的水平。
