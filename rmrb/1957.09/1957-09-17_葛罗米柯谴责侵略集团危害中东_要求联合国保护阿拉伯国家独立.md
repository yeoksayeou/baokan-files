Xinhua News Agency, Reykjavik, 16th - According to TASS: The head of the Soviet delegation to the 12th UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Gromyko, said that the UN General Assembly should strongly protect those Arab countries striving for independence and condemn the intervention of aggressive groups in Syria, Yemen, and Oman.

　　Gromyko made these remarks on September 14th while en route to New York on a Tu-104 aircraft and stopping in Keflavik. During his stay there, he answered questions posed to him by Kjalztansson, the editor of the Icelandic newspaper "People's Will."

　　Gromyko pointed out that the General Assembly must step forward to protect Syria, because the imperialists are carrying out various conspiracies in an attempt to destroy the Syrian people's will to strengthen their independence. This practice is sharpening the situation in the Middle East and forming a huge threat to universal peace. He said that Syria is standing on the front line of the Eastern people's struggle against colonialism and for their own independence. All countries that are truly concerned about peace cannot fail to support Syria. The argument of "minding one's own business" is a dangerous mistake for some countries. Yesterday it was Egypt, now it is Syria, and tomorrow it may be other countries in the Middle East that become victims of imperialist conspiracies. At the same time, only the blind cannot see that military provocations contain the danger of an outbreak of a large-scale war.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation believes that the urgent issues that this UN General Assembly should study also include the immediate cessation of testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, disarmament, strengthening cooperation between countries with different social systems, and expanding international economic and cultural ties.

　　Regarding the issue of disarmament, Gromyko pointed out that the reason why the disarmament sub-committee negotiations have not emerged from the deadlock, and have even regressed somewhat, is that Western countries do not want to implement any disarmament measures, and they resist reaching a disarmament agreement. He expressed the hope that this UN General Assembly will list the disarmament issue as a priority on the agenda for comprehensive study. When talking about the Soviet Union's attitude, he said that the Soviet Union will continue to promote practical results in disarmament in the future. Its position is open and aboveboard and well-founded: it advocates first stopping the production of weapons with increasing destructiveness and danger among major powers, and believes that this is in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries.

　　When talking about the cancellation of foreign military bases in European countries, Gromyko said that although, due to the development of military technology, the role of bases is not as important as in the past, it is still the main source of distrust and suspicion between countries. The Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested to Western countries in the past and now to reach an agreement on the cancellation of all foreign military bases on the territory of other countries. However, these countries have so far refused to adopt these proposals.

　　Gromyko finally answered the question of whether the Nordic countries can play a special role in easing international tensions and consolidating international coexistence in Europe. He said that if the governments of these countries (whether they are pursuing a neutral policy or have joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) can implement a policy aimed at establishing lasting peace in the Nordic and Baltic Sea regions and opposing the dragging of their countries into preparations for a new war through this military group, these countries can undoubtedly play a significant role in striving to ease international tensions. The Soviet Union has been and is willing to work with the Nordic countries to turn the Nordic region into a region of lasting peace. We believe that the Nordic countries will also gain considerable benefits from this. The people of these countries live much more peacefully in a peaceful region than in a region where atomic weapons are stored, as the organizers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization hope to turn the Nordic countries into.

　　葛罗米柯谴责侵略集团危害中东
　　要求联合国保护阿拉伯国家独立
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社雷克雅未克讯：苏联出席第十二届联合国大会的代表团团长、外交部长葛罗米柯说，联合国大会应该有力地出来保护那些争取独立的阿拉伯国家，谴责侵略集团对叙利亚、也门、阿曼的干涉行动。
    葛罗米柯是在9月14日乘图—一○四飞机赴纽约途中到达凯夫拉维克的。他在那里逗留期间答复了冰岛“人民意志报”编辑基雅尔坦森向他提出的一些问题。
    葛罗米柯指出，大会必须出面保护叙利亚，因为帝国主义者正在进行种种阴谋企图摧毁叙利亚人民加强独立的意志，这种做法正促使中东局势尖锐化并且形成对普遍和平的巨大威胁。他说，叙利亚正站在东方人民为反对殖民主义、争取自己的独立而斗争的前线。凡是真正关心和平的国家都不能不支持叙利亚。“事不关己、高高挂起”的论调对某些国家是一个危险的错误。昨天是埃及、现在轮到叙利亚、而明天可能是中东的另一些国家变成帝国主义阴谋的牺牲品。同时，只有瞎子才看不见，军事挑衅包含着爆发大规模战争的危险。
    苏联代表团团长认为这届联合国大会应该研究的紧要问题还有立即停止试验和禁止核武器、裁减军备、加强不同社会制度国家间的合作、扩大国际间的经济和文化联系等问题。
    关于裁军问题，葛罗米柯指出，裁军小组委员会谈判所以没有走出僵局甚至还有些倒退，是因为西方国家不想实行任何裁军措施，它们抵制达成裁军协议。他表示希望这届联合国大会把裁军问题列为议程上的首要问题来加以全面研究。他谈到苏联的态度时说，苏联今后仍将促进在裁军方面取得实际结果。它的立场是光明正大的、有根有据的：它主张首先停止在大国间生产具有越来越大的破坏力和危险性的武器，并且相信，这是符合各国人民的切身利益的。
    葛罗米柯在谈到取消外国在欧洲各国的军事基地时说，虽然，现今由于军事技术的发展，基地的作用已不像过去那样重要，然而它还是国与国之间不信任和猜疑的主要根源。苏联过去和现在一再向西方国家建议，就取消外国在别国领土上的所有军事基地达成协议。但是，这些国家至今拒绝采纳这些建议。
    葛罗米柯最后回答了北欧国家能否在缓和国际紧张局势和巩固欧洲国际共处方面起特殊作用的问题。他说，如果这些国家（不论是遵循中立政策的和加入北大西洋公约组织的）的政府能够执行以建立北欧和波罗的海地区的持久和平、反对通过这个军事集团把本国拖入准备新的战争为目的的政策，这些国家无疑可以在争取缓和国际紧张局势方面起重大作用。苏联过去和现在都愿意同北欧国家共同努力把北欧变成持久和平的地区。我们相信，北欧国家也会因此获得不小的好处。这些国家的人民生活在和平地区里比起生活在北大西洋公约组织的组织者所希望把北欧国家变成的储存原子武器的地区里要安宁得多。
