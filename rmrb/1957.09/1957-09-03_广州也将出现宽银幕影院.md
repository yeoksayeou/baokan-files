    Guangzhou to Have a Wide-Screen Cinema Too
    Guangzhou will also rebuild a local theater—the Xinhua Theater—into a wide-screen stereophonic cinema. This is the third wide-screen stereophonic cinema in China after the successful reconstruction of the Capital Cinema in Beijing and the upcoming reconstruction of the Grand Cinema in Shanghai. The design work is nearing completion and construction is expected to begin in early September and be completed and opened around November.

    广州也将出现宽银幕影院
    广州也将在当地一座戏院——新华戏院的基础上改建一座宽银幕立体声电影院。这是继北京首都电影院改建成功和上海大光明电影院即将改建之后的我国第三座宽银幕立体声电影院。目前设计工作已接近完成，约在9月初开始动工，估计约在11月便可完成开幕。
