Dr. Hatta's Speech

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Respected Ladies and Gentlemen:

As I stand before you, ready to say a few words, the outline of the past history of our two countries comes to mind. Despite the vast differences in the historical processes between nations, and despite the unique characteristics and content of Chinese history compared to Indonesia, they broadly share common ground. The histories of both countries have traversed periods of feudalism, colonial capitalism, and colonial imperialism before achieving independence. China, while nominally independent and legally sovereign, was, in fact, a semi-colonial country after the Opium War of 1840 or the Boxer Rebellion, ruled by Western nations through various treaties, such as surrender treaties. They occupied various concessions in China.

In the West, feudalism was defeated and replaced by capitalism, but the situation in Asia was different. Capitalism in Asia did not originate from within its own society but was imported from abroad, brought by Westerners who came to these countries for trade. It allowed the feudalism that shackled society to persist, even uniting with it to facilitate exploitation. The initial form of capitalism entering Asia was commercial capitalism, which sought easy ways to control the original society. For the purpose of trade, it merely occupied a few places near seaports, and these places became cities. These cities did not emerge from within but were created by external forces, becoming centers of political and economic control for foreign nations and, over time, the lifeline of colonial imperialism, especially after commercial capitalism developed into industrial capitalism.

This resulted in—as China experienced—the people suffering from dual oppression: the oppression of feudalism and the oppression of capitalism. Feudal landlords adopted certain aspects from the capitalist system to rule the weak and powerless peasants, resulting in most of the cultivated land falling into their hands. More and more peasants lost their land, becoming tenant farmers or hired laborers, and land became concentrated in the hands of a few. The common principle of capitalism is infighting and free competition. They adopted this principle to obtain higher rents than before, maintaining the nature of feudalism.

You all understand this, even more clearly than I do. I briefly mention this only to illustrate the dual oppression of feudalism and capitalism suffered by Asia.

On the Western continent, capitalism destroyed feudalism and replaced it, dominating social production. But the situation in Asia was different. In Asia, the capitalism initially imported from outside allowed feudalism to continue to exist because it was beneficial to capitalism. Due to feudalism and its capitalist tendencies in the agricultural sector, many people who lost their land went to the cities to make a living, becoming industrial workers. The more people who sold their labor, the lower the wages, and the more colonial capitalism flourished. Capitalists controlled economic power and further gained political power, thereby strengthening their rule. The governments ruling colonies and semi-colonies became the protectors of capitalism. People's rights, such as the right of workers to fight for their own interests, which existed in capitalist countries, were greatly restricted. Therefore, feudalism and capitalism combined to oppress and exploit the people, causing them immense suffering for decades.

In China, the revolution launched by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1911 has now reached the stage of overthrowing feudalism and eliminating capitalism. China is opening up a path towards socialism, and if I understand correctly, the development of Chinese socialism is guided by the doctrines of Marx and Lenin, while also not neglecting the factors and practical situations that play a role in Chinese history and the current situation.

The day before yesterday, at the airport, when I responded to Premier Zhou Enlai's welcoming remarks, I said: "Although there are ideological differences between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, our goals are the same: to strive for the prosperity and happiness of the people of our two countries." Our struggle has never been solely for national independence, but further, for the liberation of mankind from all oppression. We in Indonesia strive towards a classless society, where everyone, in a spirit of friendship, is equal to each other, sharing joys and sorrows. The paths we take may not be the same, but Indonesia will eventually realize socialism. This socialism is suited to Indonesia's own culture, customs, and history. The "Pancasila" (Five Principles), which form the foundation and ideology of the Republic of Indonesia, are the criteria for realizing the above ideals. And the fifth principle of the "Pancasila," namely socialism, is our foundation and our goal.

As I just said, Indonesia's history has also passed through periods of feudalism, colonial capitalism, and colonial imperialism before achieving independence. Similarly, foreign capitalism, which supported colonial imperialism, also used Indonesian feudalism as a tool to establish its economic and political rule. However, the situation of Indonesian feudalism is slightly different from that of Chinese feudalism. The power of Indonesian feudalism mainly did not lie in the land, because most of the land was owned by the village community, and it was not private property. Individuals could use the land and cultivate a piece of land that he and his family could manage, but he could not sell the land. Large land ownership, which is usually the lifeline of the feudal system, did not exist in Indonesia.

The past feudal forces in Indonesia were based on the rule of autocracy, which was based on the loyalty of the common people to the kings and nobles. Colonial capitalism used this situation to rule our society and make the people cheap labor in production. In the words of the Dutch themselves to describe the colonial system, the Dutch government allowed the Indonesian people to live under the management of their own national leaders whom they were willing to accept. Indonesian feudal elements who wielded great power in their territories were used as tools to establish their colonial rule and implement low-cost economic development. They used the above-mentioned feudal system to implement forced labor and deprive people of their crops. Ranks and positions were not measured by ability, but by their loyalty to the colonial government and by their ability to oppress the people in the name of the "Imperial Government."

Under the rule of colonial imperialism, the Indonesian people suffered oppression and humiliation, which aroused anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist sentiments in their hearts. In this dire situation, the ideas of humanism, as well as human, national equality and fraternity, took shape within the embrace of the national movement that began in 1908.

Therefore, the Indonesian independence movement had a socialist spirit from the very beginning. If carefully examined, it can be found that there are three objective factors that strengthened the socialist ideology that inspired the entire Indonesian national movement.

First, Marxist doctrine, which was taught by Western socialists and later expanded its influence through the great event of the Russian October Revolution in 1917.

Secondly, Islamic doctrine, which demands justice and human equality and fraternity be extended to the entire society. The justice advocated by Islam is social justice, which can only be realized when mankind is freed from all oppression. At the same time, because human fraternity and a life built on mutual assistance can only be realized in a socialist society, Islamic advocates believe that establishing a socialist society in Indonesia is its religious mission.

Thirdly, the inherent social conditions of Indonesia. Indonesian society is built on the basis of public ownership of land as a means of production, and thus is fundamentally a collectivist society. As I said just now, the land is owned by the village community. Individuals can use a piece of land that they and their families can cultivate, but cannot sell the land. If he no longer cultivates this piece of land, then the land must be returned to the village community, which can then give it to others to cultivate for a living.

In addition, all the heavy work in the village, such as plowing, harvesting rice, building houses, and funerals, is carried out through mutual assistance and cooperation. Therefore, there is already a cooperative social foundation in the countryside. Although colonialism severely damaged this situation, the foundation of collectivism still exists in the Indonesian countryside. This inherent social cooperation, which cultivates a spirit of unity and friendship, is a good foundation for establishing economic cooperation. With a social foundation, the question is how to give it economic content. However, due to the long-term oppression of capitalism and colonialism, this work is clearly not easy.

Another important factor inherent in the Indonesian countryside is collective democracy. All matters related to the common life and needs of the entire village are negotiated and decided through meetings. Common consultation, collective decision-making, and mutual assistance and cooperation are the basic content of Indonesian inherent democracy. All of this has a significant impact on the development of Indonesian socialist thought.

The above three thoughts, namely Marxist doctrine, Islamic doctrine, and Indonesian inherent collectivism, have all simultaneously influenced the socialist thought that developed in Indonesia. Marxism, as a materialist philosophy and outlook on life, is only practiced by the Indonesian communist movement. People outside this movement only regard Marxist doctrine as a theory—a scientific theory—and use it to analyze social development influenced by economic reality. In short, it is a socio-economic theory of great value.

But setting aside all differences in understanding, Indonesian socialism has its own characteristics, it strives to achieve a fair and prosperous society. In this society, there is no poverty and suffering, most people are engaged in production, and production is for the majority, and we believe the best form is the cooperative.

From what I have just said, it can probably be understood that emotions, that is, humanism and the feelings of fraternity between humans and nations, have a more profound influence on Indonesian socialism than rational understanding. This is a consequence of the legacy of the Dutch rule period in Indonesian history, as well as the result of Islam's advocacy of social life, and at the same time the result of Indonesia's inherent collectivist society.

I know that this understanding is different from the socialism understood by the People's Republic of China. Nevertheless, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia can still cooperate closely to achieve their respective ideals and goals, and these ideals and goals ultimately do not have major differences. I firmly believe that, based on the national structure and civilization of each nation, as well as the history of each nation, there is not only one path to socialism, but many different paths.

The goals of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia are roughly the same, which is to liberate the people from a life of poverty and suffering. The People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia are both equally committed to the friendship of all countries in the world. I cannot imagine a socialism that does not move in this direction. The friendship and lasting peace of all nations in the world are the ideals and goals of socialism!

In addition, there is another objective factor that also promotes cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, in order to immediately realize friendship between countries and strive for universal peace. This factor is that our two countries need to build our countries, which are backward in almost every aspect. The invasion of colonial imperialism hindered the progress of our two countries in all aspects, so our current task is to exert all our strength for construction. For construction, we need a peaceful environment and a willingness to cooperate with all countries in the world. Only in a peaceful environment can we build and catch up with foreign countries.

A peaceful environment and the willingness to cooperate with all countries in the world are inseparable. Without a peaceful environment, the willingness to cooperate cannot be consolidated. Therefore, we should exert all our strength to create a peaceful environment in this world.

I often think that if the United States and the Soviet Union, the two largest countries in the world, were willing to reach an agreement to guarantee that there would be no war between the two countries in the next twenty-five years, then a peaceful environment could be quickly formed. This agreement seems to be not ideal enough, because it cannot permanently eliminate war, but it is quite realistic in easing the current tense situation. In today's world full of psychological conflicts, overly beautiful ideals are difficult to achieve in practice. However, realistic decisions can create a long-term peaceful environment, which can play a good role in the future, and eventually make the ideals that are considered too beautiful today become a reality in the future. The fear of progress in human inventions will strengthen anti-war ideas and expand the spirit of peace.

I believe that "peaceful coexistence" between countries with conflicting ideologies will gradually be realized. What now seems to be a sharp contradiction may become less sharp in the future. Just look at how sharp the contradiction between capitalism and socialism was in the last century! How cruelly capitalism, based on the principles of non-interference and free competition, oppressed workers! They rejected all the workers' demands to improve their lives. On the other hand, the workers also advocated an irreconcilable class struggle. However, with the progress of the times and the accumulation of experience, the contradictions have gradually eased. The class struggle still exists, but it is no longer irreconcilable. In the past, many socialist ideas were forbidden by capitalism and rejected without consideration; now they are defended by the capitalists themselves in order to achieve social peace. History shows that capitalism itself has gradually changed in a certain direction and has moved far away from its original foundations. This direction is socialism.

In Article 55 of the United Nations Charter, the principle of implementing social security is put forward. This principle originated from the socialist movement in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which capitalists in the past were never willing to consider.

Modern social history shows that social trends and social philosophies that were fiercely opposed in the past have now become closer to each other. The reason is none other than that society is constantly changing. Therefore, I believe that even in the current period, countries with different ideologies can achieve "peaceful coexistence."

Here, I do not need to propose the policy of "peaceful coexistence" to you, because one of the two creators of this policy is Premier Zhou Enlai. I raise this issue only to express my support for this proposition based on the principles of the development of the times and analysis, and based on obvious facts.

While strengthening the idea of "peaceful coexistence," we should also actively promote the policy of non-interference. Because coexistence and non-interference are two in one and complement each other. If the proposition of non-interference does not receive strong support, the idea of "peaceful coexistence" cannot develop.

Once peaceful coexistence and non-interference have been recognized as sound foreign policies, which naturally include mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, the possibility of genuine cooperation between countries in the world will be guaranteed. Even if countries with conflicting ideologies cannot achieve mutual assistance in a short period of time, in coexistence, both sides can achieve mutual benefit on an equal footing by expanding trade relations.

The foreign policy of the Republic of Indonesia is known for its independent and active policy. It is independent because Indonesia does not want to join any group in a state of hostility. It is active because Indonesia actively establishes peaceful and friendly relations with all countries, regardless of their structure and domestic policies.

If Indonesia felt isolated in the early days because of its independent policy, then Indonesia would no longer feel embarrassed after the Asian-African Conference was held in Bandung. It has more friends. The ten principles of the Bandung Resolution link the Asian-African countries gathered in Bandung and become the driving force for these countries to implement peaceful policies and international cooperation policies.

In addition, there are two ideals that make the spirit of the Indonesian nation burn at all times. The first is the final elimination of colonies in the world; the second is the admission of the People's Republic of China and other countries to the United Nations, so that this organization truly becomes a universal center of world peace policy, just as it intended to be at its founding.

Respected gentlemen, now I want to end my speech. Thank you very much for your willingness to patiently listen to my speech. I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to you all. I am standing here as a friend. I hope that my speech can help strengthen the existing friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia.

Finally, I would like to express my belief here that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, China will always make valuable contributions to the close and friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, as well as to the friendly relations between Asian nations, which are a strong foundation for the realization of international friendly relations.

### 面向着未来  哈达博士的讲演

1957-09-25
第4版()
专栏：

    面向着未来
    哈达博士的讲演尊敬的周恩来阁下，尊敬的在座的诸位先生：
    当我站到各位面前准备讲几句话时，我眼前就浮现出我们两国过去历史的轮廓。尽管国与国之间历史进程的区别有多么大，尽管中国历史的特点和内容与印度尼西亚不同，但大体上却有其共同点。这两个国家的历史是经历了封建主义、殖民资本主义和殖民帝国主义时期而走向独立的。中国从前名义上虽说是独立，法理上说是有主权的国家，但，事实上从1840年鸦片战争或义和团暴动后，中国可以说是个半殖民地的国家，它被西方民族以各种条约如投降条约等统治着。他们在中国占有各种各样的租借地。
    在西方，封建主义是被资本主义所打败和代替的，但在亚洲则不同。资本主义在亚洲不是从本国社会内部产生，而是从外国输进来的，是由来到这些国家经商的西方人带来的。它仍旧让束缚社会的封建主义存在着，甚至与之联合，以利其剥削。初期进入亚洲的资本主义是商业资本主义，因而它当时寻找了容易的道路来统治原来的社会。为了通商的目的，它只是盘踞了靠近海港的几个地方，而这些地方也就出现了城市。这些城市不是从内部产生而是在外力推动下产生的，这些城市成了外来民族在政治上和经济上统治的中心，并久而久之成了殖民帝国主义的命脉，特别是在商业资本主义发展成为工业资本主义之后。
    由此产生了——如中国所经历过的：人民遭受到两种压迫。即封建主义的压迫和资本主义的压迫。封建地主从资本主义制度采纳了某些东西，便对软弱无力的农民进行统治，结果大部分耕地落到他们手中。越来越多的农民失去了土地变成佃农或雇农，土地集中于少数人的手中。资本主义的通则是互相倾轧，自由竞争。他们采用这个通则来获取比原来更高的地租，并将封建主义性质保持下来。
    这一切各位都已明白，甚至比我清楚得多，我简略地提到这个问题只是为了说明亚洲所受到的封建主义和资本主义的双重压迫。
    在西方大陆，资本主义摧毁了封建主义，并取而代之，支配了社会生产。但在亚洲，情况却不一样。在亚洲，最初从外面输进来的资本主义却让封建主义继续生存下去，因为它对资本主义有利。由于封建主义及它在农业领域内的资本主义倾向，许多失去了土地的人们跑到城市里去谋生，当产业工人。出卖劳动力的越多，工资就越低廉，殖民资本主义也就繁荣滋长起来。资本家掌握了经济统治权，又进一步掌握了政治统治权，因而他们的统治更为加强了。统治殖民地和半殖民地的国家政府成了资本主义的保护者。像在资本主义国家那样的人民权利，如工人为维护自己的利益而进行斗争的权利，是大大地受到限制。因此，封建主义和资本主义相联合压迫和剥削人民，使人民几十年来遭受了莫大的痛苦。
    在中国，1911年由孙逸仙博士所发动的革命，现在已经达到了推翻封建主义和清除资本主义的阶段。中国正在开辟走向社会主义的道路，倘若我没有理解错的话，中国社会主义的发展是以马克思和列宁的学说为指南，同时它也不忽视在中国历史上和目前形势中起作用的因素和实际情况。
    前天在机场上，我在回答周恩来总理的欢迎词时说过：“中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间虽然存在着思想意识上的区别，但是我们的目标却是一致的，都是为了争取我们两国人民生活的繁荣和幸福”。我们从事奋斗，一向都不是单纯为了争取民族的独立，而是更进一步，为了争取人类从一切压迫下解放出来。我们印度尼西亚要走向一个没有阶级的社会，在这个社会里大家本着友爱精神，彼此平等，甘苦共尝。我们两国所采取的道路也许不相同，但是印度尼西亚最后毕竟也是要实现社会主义的。这种社会主义是适合于印度尼西亚本身的文化、风俗习惯和历史的社会主义。作为印度尼西亚共和国的基础和思想意识的“五基”就是我们实现上述理想的准则。而“五基”中的第五项，即社会主义，就是我们的基础，同时也就是我们的目标。
    就像我刚才说过的，印度尼西亚的历史也是经过封建主义、殖民资本主义和殖民帝国主义等各时期而走向独立的，同样地，扶植着殖民帝国主义的外国资本主义也是利用着印度尼西亚的封建主义作为工具来建立起它的经济上和政治上的统治。可是，印度尼西亚封建主义的情况与中国的封建主义略有不同，印度尼西亚封建主义的势力主要不在于土地，因为大部分的土地是归村社所有，它不是属于个人的财产。个人可以使用土地，可以耕种他和他的家属力所能耕种的一片土地，但他不能出卖土地。大土地所有制，通常是封建主义制度统治的命脉，在印度尼西亚却不存在。
    印度尼西亚过去的封建势力树立在专制制度的统治上，这种统治的基础就是平民对国王和贵族的效忠，殖民资本主义正是利用了这种情况来统治我们的社会，并使人民在生产中成为廉价的劳动力。按照荷兰人自己形容殖民地制度的话来说，荷兰政府是让印度尼西亚人民在他们所乐于接受的本民族头目的管理下过活的，在其领地内掌握大权的印度尼西亚封建分子被当作工具来建立他们的殖民地统治和实行经费低廉的经济开发，他们利用了上述封建制度来实施强迫劳役制和剥夺人民农作物的制度，级别和职位不是按照才能来衡量，而是按照他对殖民政府的效忠和按照他以“皇上政府”的名义对人民进行压迫的本事来衡量。
    在殖民帝国主义的统治下，印度尼西亚人民饱尝了压迫和凌辱，从而在他们的心灵里激起了反资本主义反帝国主义的情绪。在这种水深火热的境遇中，人道主义的思想，以及人类、民族平等博爱的思想便在1908年开始的民族运动的怀抱里形成。
    因此，印度尼西亚的独立运动一开始就有着社会主义的精神。如果认真地加以考察，就可发现有三种客观因素加强了印度尼西亚那种鼓舞整个民族运动的社会主义思想。
    首先是马克思学说，它是由西方社会主义者传授过来的，后来又经1917年俄国十月革命这一伟大事件而扩大影响。
    其次是伊斯兰教义，它要求着普及于全社会的正义和人类的平等博爱。伊斯兰教主张的正义是社会的正义，这只有在人类摆脱一切压迫的情况下才能实现。同时由于人类的博爱和建筑在互助基础上的生活只有在社会主义的社会里才能实现，因此，伊斯兰教的倡导者认为：在印度尼西亚建立社会主义社会是它的宗教使命。
    第三是印度尼西亚固有的社会情况。印度尼西亚社会建筑在作为生产资料的土地公有制的基础上，因而基本上是集体主义的社会。正如刚才我说过的，土地是归村社所有。个人可以使用本人和家属力所能耕作的一片土地，但不能出售土地。如果他不再耕种这片土地，那末，这片土地就须归还给村社，而村社则可以把它让给别人耕种过活。
    此外，村里一切繁重的工作，如犁田、割稻、造屋、丧葬等都是通过互助合作的方式进行的。因之，农村里本来就有了合作的社会基础。虽然殖民主义严重地破坏了这种情况，但是集体主义的基础迄今仍然存在于印度尼西亚的农村中。这种固有的、培育着团结友爱精神的社会合作，是建立经济合作的良好基础。有了社会基础，问题就在于如何使它带有经济内容。但是由于资本主义与殖民主义的长期压迫，这个工作显然并不是轻而易举的。
    印度尼西亚农村中固有的另一重要因素是集体的民主。一切有关全村的共同生活和需要的事项都通过会议来协商和决定。共同协商、集体决定和互助合作是印度尼西亚固有的民主的基本内容。这一切对印度尼西亚社会主义思想的发展都有着重大的影响。
    上述三种思想，即马克思学说、伊斯兰教义以及印度尼西亚固有的集体主义，对在印度尼西亚发展的社会主义思想都同时发生了影响。作为唯物主义哲学和人生观的马克思主义，只为印度尼西亚共产主义运动所奉行。这个运动以外的人却只把马克思学说当作一种理论——一种科学的理论——来理解，并用它来分析受经济现实影响的社会发展。简言之，它是一种具有重大价值的社会经济学理论。
    但是撇开一切认识上的分歧来说，印度尼西亚的社会主义具有它自己的特色，它争取实现一种公道和繁荣的社会。在这种社会里，无所谓贫困与痛苦，大多数人都从事生产，而生产也为了大多数人，我们认为最好的形式就是合作社。
    从我刚才所说的，大概可以这样理解：感情，即人道主义和人类、民族间的博爱感情比起那理性的认识对印度尼西亚的社会主义是具有更深刻的影响。这是在印度尼西亚历史上荷兰统治时期所遗留下来的后果，也是伊斯兰教对社会生活的主张的后果，同时又是印度尼西亚固有的集体主义社会的结果。
    我知道，这种认识和中华人民共和国所理解的社会主义是不同的。虽然如此，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间仍然可以密切合作，以求实现各自的理想和目标，而这个理想和目标最后是没有重大的差别。我深信，根据各民族的国家结构和文明以及各民族的历史，通向社会主义的道路不只是一条，而是有多种多样的道路。
    中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国的目标大致上是相同的，都是要把人民从贫困和痛苦的生活中解放出来。中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国都同样致力于世界各国的友好。我不能想像有一种不朝着这个方向走的社会主义。世界各民族的友好和持久的和平是社会主义的理想和目标！
    此外，还有一个客观的因素也促使了中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国合作，以求即刻实现各国之间的友好和争取普遍的和平。这个因素就是：我们两国需要建设我们几乎在各个方面都落后的国家。殖民帝国主义的侵入妨碍了我们两个国家在各方面的进步，所以我们目前的任务就是发挥我们所有的力量来进行建设。为了建设，我们需要有和平的环境以及和世界各国合作的愿望。只有在和平的环境中，我们才能够建设，才能够赶上外国。
    和平环境以及和世界各国合作的愿望这两者是不能分割的。没有和平的环境，合作的愿望就不能巩固。因此，我们应该发挥我们所有的力量在这个世界上造成和平的环境。
    我常常想到，假如美国和苏联这两个世界上最大的国家愿意达成一个协议，保证在未来的二十五年内两国之间不进行战争的话，那末和平的环境就能很快地形成。这种协议看来似乎不够理想，因为它不能永久地消灭战争，但对于缓和目前的紧张局势来说，它却是相当现实的。在今天这样充满着心理冲突的世界，过于美好的理想在实践中是难于实现的。但是，现实的决定可以造成一个长时期的和平环境，它对未来能起良好的作用，并最后使今天被视为过于美好的理想在将来变成为现实。人类发明上的进步的恐惧，将会加强反战思想与扩大和平精神。
    我相信，思想意识对立的国家之间的“和平共处”是会逐渐实现的。现在看来是尖锐的矛盾，将来也许会变得不尖锐。试看，资本主义与社会主义之间的矛盾在上一世纪是何等的尖锐！以不干涉和自由竞争为原则的资本主义是如何残酷地压迫工人！他们拒绝了工人改善生活的一切要求。另一方面，工人们也主张进行不可调和的阶级斗争。但是，随着时代的进步以及经验的积累，矛盾就逐渐地缓和了。阶级斗争依然存在，但已不是不可调和了。过去，许多社会主义的思想被资本主义所禁止，并且毫无考虑地加以拒绝；现在却为资本家自己所维护了，以求达到社会和平。历史显示了：资本主义本身已逐渐向某个方向变化而远远地离开了其原来的基础。这个方向就是社会主义。
    在联合国宪章第五十五条里面，提出了实行社会保障的原则。这个原则渊源于十九世纪和二十世纪初期的社会主义运动，而资本家过去则从来不愿意加以考虑。
    近代的社会历史说明了，过去剧烈对立的社会思潮和社会哲学，现在已经彼此互相接近了。其原因不是别的，而是因为社会在不断的变化。因此我相信，即使在目前时期，各个不同思想意识的国家也能够实现“和平共处”。
    在这里，我不需要向各位提出“和平共处”的政策，因为这个政策的两位缔造者之一就是周恩来总理。我提出这个问题，无非是根据时代发展的原理和分析，根据明显的事实，来表示我对这个主张的支持。
    在加强“和平共处”的思想的同时，我们还应该积极地提倡互不干涉的政策。因为共处和互不干涉是两位一体相辅相成的。互不干涉的主张没有获得强有力的支持，“和平共处”的思想也就不能发展。
    一旦和平共处与互不干涉已被公认为健全的外交政策，其中自然也包含着互相尊重各国的主权与领土完整以及互不干涉他国内政，这样世界各国之间的真正合作的可能性就有了保障。即使思想意识相互对立的国家在短期间内不能实现互助，在共处当中，双方也可以在平等的基础上通过扩大贸易关系的方式达到互利。
    印度尼西亚共和国的外交政策是以自主和积极的政策著称的。它是自主的，因为印度尼西亚不愿加入处在敌对状态中的任何集团。它是积极的，因为印度尼西亚积极地和各国建立和平友好关系，不论这些国家的结构和对内政策是怎么样。
    如果说印度尼西亚因其自主的政策而在初期感到孤立的话，那末当亚非会议于万隆召开之后，印度尼西亚再也不会感到困窘了。它的朋友多了。万隆决议的十项原则联结着在万隆集会的亚非国家，成为了这些国家执行和平政策与国际合作政策的推动力。
    此外，还有两个理想使印度尼西亚民族的精神时刻在炽燃着。第一是世界上殖民地的最后消灭；第二是中华人民共和国和其他一些国家加入联合国，使这个机构真正成为全世界和平政策的普遍性的中心，正如它在成立时所抱的宗旨那样。
    尊敬的先生们，现在我要结束我的讲话。承蒙诸位先生乐意耐心地倾听我的讲话，我趁此机会向诸位先生致以十二万分的谢意。我是以朋友的身份站在这里。我希望我的讲话能有助于加强中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间已有的友谊。
    最后，我在这里想表明我这样的信念：在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，中国将会始终对中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国的亲密友好关系，以及作为实现国际友好关系的强有力的基础的亚洲各民族间的友好关系，作出宝贵的贡献。（附图片）
