This year, the cotton growing situation in various parts of our country is generally good. The unit area yield of cotton fields has generally increased compared to last year. In some areas of Anhui and Sichuan, it has doubled compared to last year, and the quality of cotton in various places is also higher than last year. This is the result of the hard work and meticulous cultivation of the vast number of cotton farmers under the strong support of the state. Now that the unified purchase of new cotton has begun, the vast number of cotton farmers should respond actively to the call of the Party and the state, in accordance with their consistent patriotic spirit, and sell as much cotton as possible to the state to support national industrial production and economic construction.

As everyone knows, the development of the cotton textile industry is of extreme importance in our country's current economic construction. The characteristic of building cotton textile mills is that they require little investment and produce quick results. For example, building a textile mill with 100,000 spindles and 3,500 looms only requires an investment of 35 million yuan and takes one year and one month. It only takes two years and one month from basic construction to recovering the entire investment. After that, it can accumulate 35 million yuan of funds for the country every year. This shows that developing the cotton textile industry can not only produce a large number of textiles to meet the needs of the broad masses of people, but also rapidly accumulate funds for the country to be used for other constructions in the national economy. However, developing the cotton textile industry requires a large amount of cotton. For example, a cotton textile mill with 100,000 spindles and 3,500 looms requires 400,000 dan of ginned cotton per year, calculated on a three-shift production basis. Without enough cotton, the machines cannot be fully utilized.

Last year, due to the impact of natural disasters, cotton production decreased. In addition, the unified purchase work was too relaxed, and the state collected less ginned cotton. Cotton textile mills reduced shifts and suspended operations due to insufficient raw cotton. This has made the supply of cotton cloth tight this year, so that the state has had to lower the supply quota for cloth this year. In view of this situation, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, in the "Instructions on the Unified Purchase of Cotton This Year" issued on September 7 this year, called on cotton farmers to establish the idea of building the country and managing their families through diligence and thrift, producing and selling more, retaining less for frugal use, drying and picking clean, and selling good cotton to the state. If every cotton farmer can do this, then, although the cotton problem cannot be completely solved, it can be solved to a large extent, greatly alleviating the tight cotton supply situation.

The state must seize the time for cotton purchasing work. The cotton purchasing season has arrived, and cotton farmers in various places should sell new cotton to the state as soon as possible. We can believe that because cotton is growing well this year, as long as we strengthen late-stage field management and pick it cleanly at harvest, we can strive to harvest more cotton. At the same time, because the cotton area farmers have always retained more cotton for their own use than in general areas, and have more sufficient bedding and cotton wadding for winter clothing than in general areas, there will be no major difficulties this year if the cotton farmers in these areas retain less cotton for their own use. Our country has nearly 200 million cotton farmers. If each person retains one less jin of cotton, the state can buy nearly 200 million jin more ginned cotton. This will undoubtedly be a great contribution to the production of the cotton textile industry and national economic construction. And it is very beneficial for agricultural cooperatives and cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas to sell more cotton to the state, obtain payment, which can not only be invested in agricultural production and increase the unit area yield of cotton fields next year, but also appropriately improve their lives.

Some cotton farmers are unwilling to sell more cotton to the state because they want to retain more cotton to develop indigenous spinning and weaving to increase their income. This situation should be changed as much as possible. Indigenous spinning and weaving is one of the sources of income for cotton farmers in some areas, and this habit has also existed historically. However, it should be seen that indigenous spinning and weaving wastes a lot of cotton compared to machine spinning and weaving. One jin of cotton used for indigenous spinning and weaving can generally only weave twelve square feet of cloth; while machine weaving can weave more than thirty square feet. This shows that indigenous spinning and weaving is far less cost-effective than machine spinning and weaving. In order to take care of the habit of some people wearing homemade cloth, the state adopts a policy of appropriately maintaining the existing indigenous spinning and weaving; but if cotton farmers blindly develop indigenous spinning and weaving again, it will be incorrect. The correct policy should obviously be to compress indigenous spinning and weaving as much as possible, and use the saved cotton to support the machine textile industry, create more wealth for society, and accumulate more funds for the country. As for the surplus rural labor force saved by reducing indigenous spinning and weaving, various places should take other measures to find ways out for them. There are many avenues for rural sideline occupations in various places, and the leading organs should actively organize and lead them.

There are also some cotton farmers who are unwilling to sell more cotton to the state because they saw that the free market was profitable last year, and they still want to sell cotton at high prices in the free market this year. This is a capitalist ideology that only cares about personal interests and does not care about national interests. Every patriotic cotton farmer should resolutely oppose this practice. In fact, the situation this year is different from last year. In order to ensure the completion of the state's procurement plan for agricultural products, the State Council has stipulated that agricultural products and other materials that are purchased and unified by the state's plan are not allowed to enter the free market, and cotton is no exception. Any free trade of cotton this year will be regarded as illegal. Every agricultural cooperative and patriotic cotton farmer should overcome and criticize the individualistic and capitalist ideas of retaining more and selling less, and attempting to take cotton to the free market to make high profits, strengthen the overall concept, establish the idea of loving the country, the society, and the family, and use practical actions of retaining less and selling more, retaining inferior cotton and selling good cotton, saving cotton, quickly harvesting and selling, picking clean and drying, and ensuring the completion of the state's cotton unified purchase task, to actively support the country's socialist construction.

Our country's economic support to farmers in cotton-producing areas has been huge in recent years. From the implementation of the unified purchase of cotton in 1954 to the present in 1957, the state has prepaid more than 740 million yuan of interest-free deposits to cotton farmers, and additionally supplied more than 920 million feet of cotton cloth, and preferentially supplied more than 4.6 billion jin of cake fertilizer (this item does not include the 1957 figure). This economic support has played an important role in increasing the unit area yield of cotton fields and striving for a bumper cotton harvest. Therefore, it is completely right for cotton farmers to sell more cotton to the state when the cotton harvest is good this year. Only in this way can we help the country overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw cotton, so that the country can develop industrial production, and in the future, it will be possible to devote greater efforts to support agricultural production. Now, the farmers in grain-producing areas have greatly improved their socialist consciousness through ideological debates, and are actively handing over public grain and surplus grain, making great contributions to the country. We believe that the patriotic spirit and the degree of socialist awareness of the farmers in cotton-producing areas are by no means lower than that of the farmer brothers in other regions. Everyone must also understand the great principles, and everyone will certainly actively respond to the call of the state, and in the next few months, sell more and better cotton to the state, and make greater contributions to the country's economic construction. This is the glorious task of the vast number of patriotic cotton farmers today.

At present, there are still some problems in the unified purchase of cotton in various places. This is manifested in the fact that the publicity and education on the unified purchase of cotton in many areas is not deep and detailed enough; many areas have not placed the unified purchase of cotton work in its proper position in the leading work; the preparatory work for cotton purchase is also insufficient, and the strength is weak. Now that new cotton is being marketed in large quantities, party and government leading departments in various places should seize the opportunity, concentrate their efforts, solve problems, and strive to purchase most of the cotton in a short period of time. Commercial departments in cotton-producing areas should make the greatest efforts to do a good job in supplying goods during the peak season to meet the needs of farmers in cotton-producing areas.

### 棉农们当前的光荣任务

    棉农们当前的光荣任务
    今年我国各地棉花生长情况普遍良好，棉田单位面积产量比去年普遍有所增加，安徽、四川的部分地区比去年增加了一倍，各地棉花的质量也比去年高。这是广大棉农在国家的大力支持下，精耕细作和辛勤劳动的结果。现在新棉的统购工作已经开始，广大棉农们应该根据一贯的爱国主义精神，积极地响应党和国家的号召，尽量多卖棉花给国家，支援国家工业生产和经济建设。
    大家知道，棉纺织工业的发展，在我国当前经济建设中具有极为重要的意义。建设棉纺织厂的特点，是投资少而收效快。例如建设一座拥有十万纱锭、三千五百台织布机的纺织厂，只需三千五百万元的投资，一年零一个月的时间。从基本建设到收回全部投资，只需要两年零一个月。此后每年就可以为国家积累三千五百万元的资金。这就说明，发展棉纺织工业不但可以生产大量纺织品，来满足广大人民的需要；而且可以为国家迅速地积累资金，用于国民经济的其他建设。可是，发展棉纺织业是需要大量棉花的。例如一个拥有十万纱锭和三千五百台织布机的棉纺织厂，以每天三班生产计算，一年就需要四十万担皮棉。没有足够的棉花，机器就不能充分利用。
    去年由于自然灾害的影响，棉花减产；加上统购工作偏松，国家少收了皮棉，棉纺织厂因原棉不足，曾经部分地减少班次，停工待料。这就使得今年棉布供应紧张起来，以致国家今年不得不降低布的供应定额。鉴于这种情况，中共中央和国务院在今年9月7日发布的“关于本年度棉花统购工作的指示”中，号召棉农们树立勤俭建国和勤俭持家的思想，多产多卖，少留节用，晒干拣净，多卖好棉给国家。如果每个棉农都能够这样做，那末，棉花问题虽然不能完全解决，却也可以解决很大一部分，使棉花供应紧张的情况大大地缓和下来。
    国家对于棉花的收购工作必须抓紧时间，现在购棉的季节已经到了，各地棉农应该尽快地踊跃地把新棉多卖给国家。我们可以相信，因为今年棉花长得好，各地只要加强后期田间管理，收获时摘取干净，就可以争取多收一部分棉花；同时，因为棉区农民历年来自己留用的棉花都比一般地区多，冬季用的被絮和棉衣絮花等也比一般地区充足，今年这些地区的棉农大家少留自用棉，也不会发生大的困难。我国棉农有近二亿人，每人少留一斤棉花，国家就可以多买到近二亿斤皮棉。这对于棉纺织业的生产和国家经济建设，无疑地都是很大的贡献。而产棉区的农业合作社和棉农们多卖棉花给国家，得到价款，不但可以投入农业生产，提高明年棉田的单位面积产量，并且可以适当地改善生活。这对于农业社和棉农们也都十分有利。
    有些棉农因为想要多留一些棉花来发展土纺土织，增加收入，就不愿意多卖棉花给国家，这种情形应当尽量改变。土纺土织在某些地区是棉农增加收入的来源之一，而且历史上也有这种习惯。但是应该看到，土纺土织同机器纺织比较，浪费棉花是很多的。一斤棉花用于土纺土织，一般只能织布十二平方尺；而用机器织布就能织三十多平方尺。这就说明了土纺土织远不如机器纺织合算。国家为了照顾一部分群众穿用土布的习惯，对于已有的土纺土织采取适当维持的方针；但是如果棉农们盲目地再去发展土纺土织，就是不正确的了。正确的方针，显然应该是尽可能地压缩土纺土织，把节余下来的棉花用来支持机器纺织工业，为社会创造更多的财富，为国家积累更多的资金。至于因为缩减土纺土织而节省出来的农村剩余劳动力，各地应当采取其他办法，为他们找寻出路。农村副业的门路，各地都有很多，领导机关应当积极加以组织领导。
    还有一部分棉农不愿意多卖棉花给国家，是因为他们看到去年自由市场有利可图，今年仍然想把棉花用高价在自由市场出售。这是一种只顾个人利益、不顾国家利益的资本主义思想。每一个爱国的棉农都应该坚决反对这种做法。事实上，今年的情况已经和去年有所不同。为了保证完成国家对农产品的采购计划，国务院已经规定凡是由国家计划收购和统一收购的农产品及其他物资，都不准进入自由市场，棉花也不例外。今年任何棉花的自由交易，都将被当作违法行为。每个农业社和爱国的棉农应该克服和批判多留少卖和企图把棉花拿到自由市场高价牟利的个人主义和资本主义思想，加强整体观念，树立爱国、爱社、爱家思想，用少留多卖、留次棉卖好棉、节约用棉、快收快卖、摘净晒干、保证完成国家棉花统购任务的实际行动，来积极支援国家的社会主义建设。
    我们的国家几年来在经济上给予产棉区农民的支持是巨大的。从1954年实行棉花统购起，到1957年的现在为止，国家预付给棉农的无息定金就有七亿四千多万元，额外供应的棉布有九亿二千多万尺，优先供应的饼肥四十六亿斤以上（这一项还不算1957年的数字）。这种经济上的支持对于提高棉田单位面积产量，争取棉花丰收，起了重要作用。因此，在今年棉花丰收的时候，棉农们多卖一些棉花给国家，是完全应该的。只有这样，才能帮助国家克服原棉不足的困难，使国家发展工业生产，将来有可能拿出更大的力量来支持农业生产。现在，粮食产区的农民经过思想大辩论，社会主义觉悟大大提高，正在积极地交售公粮和余粮，对国家作出很大贡献。我们相信产棉区的农民们，爱国主义的精神和社会主义的觉悟程度决不低于其他地区的农民弟兄，大家一定也都懂得大道理，一定也会积极地响应国家的号召，在今后几个月内把更多更好的棉花卖给国家，为国家经济建设作出更大的贡献。这是广大爱国棉农当前的光荣任务。
    目前，各地在棉花统购工作上还有些问题，这表现在许多地区对棉花统购问题的宣传教育还不够深入和细致；不少地区还没有把棉花统购工作放在领导工作的应有位置上；棉花收购的准备工作也不够，并且力量薄弱。现在新棉正在大量上市，各地党和政府领导部门应该抓紧时机，集中力量，解决问题，争取在短时期内，将大部棉花收购起来。棉产区的商业部门应该尽最大努力做好旺季物资供应工作，以满足产棉区农民的需要。
