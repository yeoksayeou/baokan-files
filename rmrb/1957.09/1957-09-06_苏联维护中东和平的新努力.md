    New Soviet Efforts to Maintain Peace in the Middle East
    Commentator of this Newspaper

    The Soviet Union has once again sent notes to the United States, Britain, and France, proposing that the four major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—issue a joint declaration condemning the use of force in the Middle East and guaranteeing non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in the region. This is a new effort by the Soviet Union to eliminate tensions in the Middle East and maintain peace and independence for countries in the region.

    In April of this year, the Soviet government, in a note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, proposed this suggestion for maintaining peace in the Middle East. The Soviet government believes that a joint guarantee by the four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—to renounce the use of force in the Middle East would be the first step towards improving the health and normalization of the situation in the region. However, disregarding the peaceful aspirations of the world and the people of the Middle East, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France rejected that just appeal from the Soviet government. In their replies to the Soviet Union, the three governments made every effort to justify their unreasonable actions, insisting that the tensions in the Middle East were not caused by the aggressive policies pursued by Western colonial powers, but attributed the fundamental cause of the tensions in the Middle East to the Arab-Israeli dispute.

    This fallacy of the US, British, and French governments is clearly an attempt to cover up their aggressive actions in the Middle East, but this fallacy has long been criticized by Arab countries and world public opinion. The recent developments in the Middle East have proved that the tensions in the Middle East and the threats to peace in the region are entirely caused by the aggressive actions of Western colonial countries, especially the United States. The bloody suppression of the Algerian people by France, the armed invasion of Oman by Britain, and the aggression against Yemen have kept the flames of war burning in the Middle East. The result of the United States' pursuit of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has further prevented the easing of the Middle East situation. The United States manufactured the Jordanian incident and overthrew the Nabelsi government in Jordan, and then successively plotted conspiracies to subvert the governments of Egypt and Syria. The United States has attempted to drag some Arab countries into the Baghdad Pact aggressive bloc, and, together with Britain and France, supported Israeli violations of Arab national interests. Currently, the tense situation in the Middle East is intensifying around the United States' aggressive activities against Syria. After the United States' conspiracy to subvert Syria was exposed, it immediately dispatched State Department subversion conspiracy "expert" Henderson to the Middle East to deploy new conspiracies to invade Syria, attempting to use Arabs to fight Arabs and incite fratricide among Arab countries in order to achieve the United States' goal of colonial expansion in the Middle East.

    Regarding these irrefutable facts, no matter how the propagandists in Washington, London, and Paris use their glib tongues to cleverly conceal them, the people of Arab countries can still see them very clearly. The people of Arab countries are increasingly aware that imperialism is the common enemy of the Arab nation, with whom there can be no reconciliation. They are working hard to overcome the obstacles set by Western colonial countries on their road to independence, strengthening national unity to resist imperialist aggression. They jointly support the just struggles of the Algerian and Omani people; today, when Syria is facing a serious threat from American aggressive forces, they are promoting the spirit of sharing weal and woe, supporting the struggle of the Syrian people. The signing of the economic alliance agreement between Egypt and Syria demonstrates the Arab nation's lofty will to unite against foreign enemies, overcome difficulties together, and develop the national economy. Syrian President Kuwatly recently said that "Arab nationalism, which is like a giant, will be vigilant against all conspiracies and will be able to prevent all conspiracies and meetings against us from achieving their goals." This shows the spirit of the Arab people not succumbing to violence.

    At the same time, the just struggle of the Arab people in the Middle East to defend peace in the region and maintain national independence has the sympathy and support of the world's peace forces, led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France will be a great encouragement to Arab nationalism. In its note, the Soviet government strongly condemned the aggressive activities of the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East, and especially condemned the United States' conspiracy to interfere in Syria. The note also warned the United States, Britain, and France that any actions to drag Middle Eastern countries into military alliances would have dangerous consequences.

    The governments of the United States, Britain, and France should understand the serious significance of this warning from the Soviet Union. They have no reason to reject the Soviet government's proposal on maintaining peace in the Middle East. What Washington should be particularly reminded of here is that the United States' "position of strength" policy has gone bankrupt. If the United States still dares to set fire in the Middle East, then it will never be able to escape the severe sanctions of the world's peace forces!

    苏联维护中东和平的新努力
    本报评论员
    苏联再次照会美英法三国，建议由苏美英法四大国发表一个共同宣言，谴责在中东使用武力，保证不干涉这个地区国家的内政。这是苏联为消除中东紧张局势，维护中东各国和平和独立的新努力。
    今年4月间，苏联政府给美、英、法三国政府的照会里，曾经提出了这个维护中东和平的建议。苏联政府认为，由联合国安全理事会常任理事国的苏美英法四大国共同保证在中东放弃使用武力，将是使这个地区的局势健康化和正常化的第一步。但是，美、英、法三国政府竟然不顾全世界和中东人民的和平愿望，拒绝了苏联政府的那次正义呼吁。三国政府在致苏联的复照中，还为它们的这种无理行动进行了百般辩解，硬说中东的紧张局势不是由西方殖民国家推行侵略政策所引起的，而把中东紧张局势的基本原因归之于阿拉伯—以色列的纠纷。
    美英法三国政府的这种谬论，显然是企图掩盖它们在中东的侵略行动，但是这种谬论早就遭到了阿拉伯国家和世界舆论的抨击。最近一个时期来中东局势的发展证明，中东局势的紧张和这一地区和平的遭受威胁，完全是西方殖民国家特别是美国的侵略行动所引起的。法国对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥镇压，英国对阿曼人民的武装进攻和对也门的侵略，使得战火一直在中东燃烧。美国推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的结果，更使得中东局势得不到缓和。美国制造了约旦事件，推翻了约旦纳布西政府之后，又先后策划了企图颠覆埃及和叙利亚政府的阴谋。美国企图把一些阿拉伯国家拉入巴格达条约侵略集团，并同英法一道支持以色列侵犯阿拉伯的民族利益。目前，围绕着美国对叙利亚的侵略活动，中东紧张局势更形加剧。美国在策划颠覆叙利亚的阴谋败露以后，立即派遣了国务院颠覆阴谋“专家”汉德逊到中东去，部署侵略叙利亚的新阴谋，企图利用阿拉伯人去打阿拉伯人，煽起阿拉伯各国之间的自相残杀，以达到美国在中东进行殖民扩张的目的。
    对于这些无可辩驳的事实，不管华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的宣传家们如何鼓其如簧之舌，巧为掩饰，但是阿拉伯各国人民还是看得很清楚的。阿拉伯各国人民越来越认清了帝国主义是阿拉伯民族不共戴天的共同的敌人。他们正在努力克服西方殖民国家在他们独立道路上所布置的障碍，加强民族团结，以反抗帝国主义的侵略。他们共同支持了阿尔及利亚和阿曼人民的正义斗争；在叙利亚遭到美国侵略势力严重威胁的今天，他们正发扬着患难与共的精神，支持叙利亚人民的斗争。埃及和叙利亚两国经济联盟协定的签订，表明了阿拉伯民族团结御侮，共同克服困难，发展民族经济的崇高意志。叙利亚总统库阿特利最近说，“形同巨人的阿拉伯民族主义将警惕一切阴谋，能够使反对我们的一切阴谋和会议达不到目的。”这表示了阿拉伯人民不为强暴所屈的精神。
    同时，中东阿拉伯人民为保卫中东地区的和平与维护民族独立而进行的正义斗争中，有着以苏联为首的全世界和平力量的同情和支持。苏联这次给予美英法三国政府的照会，对于阿拉伯民族主义将是一个极大的鼓舞。苏联政府在照会中强烈地谴责了美英法在中东的侵略活动，特别谴责了美国对叙利亚的干涉阴谋。照会并且警告美英法三国，要把中东国家拉入军事联盟的任何行动都会产生危险的后果。
    美英法三国政府应该理解苏联这个警告的严重意义。它们没有任何理由拒绝苏联政府所提出的关于维护中东和平的倡议。这里特别应该提醒华盛顿的是，美国的“实力地位”政策已经破产了，如果美国还胆敢在中东放火，那末，它就决不可能逃避世界和平力量的严厉制裁！
