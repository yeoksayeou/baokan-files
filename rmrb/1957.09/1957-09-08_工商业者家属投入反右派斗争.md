Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: Industrialist and businessman family members in various locations have successively joined the anti-Rightist struggle. According to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, key members of industrialist and businessman families in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and other places, under the leadership of local democratic women's federations, have studied Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the main documents related to the anti-Rightist struggle. Now, they basically understand the significance of the anti-Rightist struggle. Some have already participated in meetings of the industrial and commercial sectors to fight against the Rightists face-to-face through reasoned arguments. In Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and other places, many key members of industrialist and businessman families are encouraging their husbands to resolutely draw a clear ideological line with the Rightists.

Currently, a backbone force of industrialist and businessman family members has been formed and is constantly expanding. Under the specific leadership of local women's federations, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce organizations, the industrialist and businessman families in various cities have done a lot of work for the families of Rightists in the industrial and commercial sectors. Now, various places are also formulating comprehensive educational plans for the anti-Rightist struggle, preparing to further conduct a broad and in-depth socialist ideological education campaign for all industrialist and businessman family members.

According to relevant sources, this is just the beginning, and there are still some problems that need further study and resolution in the current work. For example, some regions only pay attention to helping a few families of Rightists, while neglecting to conduct positive socialist education for the majority of industrialist and businessman families; the backbone force of family members urgently needs to be cultivated, improved, and expanded; the content and methods of propaganda and education for family members need to be more popular and lively, etc.

    工商业者家属投入反右派斗争
    据新华社7日讯　各地工商业者家属相继投入反右派斗争。据全国工商联了解，北京、天津、上海、南京、杭州、无锡、镇江、苏州等地工商业者家属中的骨干分子，在当地民主妇联的领导下，已经学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演和有关反右派斗争的主要文件。现在她们基本上懂得了反右派斗争的意义。有的已经参加工商界反右派斗争的会议，向右派分子进行面对面的说理斗争。上海、镇江、苏州等地不少工商业者家属骨干分子鼓励她们的丈夫坚决同右派划清思想界限。
    目前工商业者家属骨干队伍已经形成，并在不断扩大。各城市的工商业者家属们，在当地妇联、民建会、工商联组织的具体领导下，对工商界右派分子的家属进行了不少工作。现在各地还在拟订全面的反右派斗争教育的规划，准备进一步向全体工商业者家属进行一次广泛深入的社会主义思想教育工作。
    据有关方面谈，这还仅仅是开始，目前工作中还存在着一些需要进一步研究解决的问题。例如有些地区只注重了对少数右派分子家属的帮助，而忽略了对广大工商业者家属进行正面的社会主义教育；家属的骨干队伍还迫切需要培养、提高和扩大；对家属宣传教育的内容、方式还需要更加通俗、更加活泼等。
