　　Japan's Balance of Payments Crisis and Two Paths for Japanese Economic Development
　　Bai He
    The Crisis in Japan's Balance of Payments
    In July of last year, Japan's Economic Planning Agency published the 1956 Economic White Paper, specifically pointing out that "Japan has ended the post-war recovery period," and then said that the Japanese economy would continue to prosper. At this time, some people in Japanese society said that this was unprecedented prosperity since Emperor Jimmu, the so-called "Jimmu Boom." However, since the beginning of this year, Japan's balance of payments has begun to show cracks, imports and exports have lost balance, and the trade deficit has continued to rise. By July of this year, it had reached 1.145 billion US dollars, exceeding the previous crisis of 1.135 billion US dollars in 1953. By June of this year, the balance of payments deficit reached 520 million US dollars, and foreign exchange reserves were only 870 million US dollars. Among them, excluding the trade bad debts owed by Indonesia, South Korea, and Argentina (270 million US dollars) and temporary deferred payments from foreign banks, Japan could only dispose of less than 300 million US dollars in foreign exchange. Japanese economists say that this is worse than the 1953 crisis because the economic scale is much larger now than it was then.
    Japanese Minister of Finance Hisato Ichimada recently said that it would be best if the international balance of payments deficit this year could be kept at 400 to 500 million US dollars. To this end, the Bank of Japan has twice raised lending rates and tightened credit. Before Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States, the Japanese cabinet meeting (June 14) hastily decided on eight "Comprehensive Economic Measures," and on June 19, it formulated five "Emergency Measures," trying its best to restrict imports, expand exports, borrow from abroad, and suppress investment.
    Under this series of austerity policies, unhealthy factors in the economy have become more obvious: (1) The market is flooded with bad checks. In May of this year, more than 59,000 bad checks appeared in Tokyo alone, totaling more than 1.5 billion yen. In July, this increased to more than 60,000 checks, reaching the highest record since the war. (2) Stock prices have fallen. According to the average figures of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in July, they had fallen to 470 yen, a decrease of nearly 20% from the highest price of 595 yen on May 4. (3) The trend of small and medium-sized enterprises going bankrupt has intensified. In the first half of this year, 310 textile factories went bankrupt, twice as many as in the same period last year, and the amount of debt increased three times. In July, more than 70 more factories went bankrupt, breaking the record since February 1954. (4) Prices have plummeted, and some sectors have begun to experience overproduction. For example, as of July, rayon had fallen from 250 yen per pound in December of last year to 167 yen. To alleviate the crisis, various companies are successively shortening working hours. In addition, industrial and mining production, which has been rising since the war, showed a downward trend in June. According to statistics from the Japan Economic Planning Agency, the industrial and mining production index in June was 255.8 (1934-1936 = 100), a decrease of 1.1% from May. The above trend will be even more serious in the second half of the year. Japanese financial groups are clamoring to revitalize exports and open up the current difficult situation, and society is also shouting "Jimmu Recession."
    It is hard not to feel strange as to why the Japanese economy has shown such a neurotic joy and sorrow in less than a year. But upon careful analysis, this is not strange at all, this is the outbreak of the fundamental problem on the path of Japan's economic development after the war.
    Reasons for Japan's Balance of Payments Crisis
    Due to US control, the composition of Japan's post-war trade has undergone unnatural changes. Although the Japanese economy has recovered and developed, exports in foreign trade in 1956 only recovered to 86% of the pre-war level, while imports increased by 14% compared to pre-war levels.
    Japan is a country that relies on overseas trade. Last year, imports were 3.2 billion US dollars, of which raw materials and fuel accounted for 72%; food accounted for 17%; and exports were almost entirely manufactured goods. Based on these characteristics, Japan and the Asian market have a natural combination of conditions. Before the war, Japan's exports to the Asian market accounted for 62.9% of its total exports, but in 1956 it fell to 40.9%; while exports to the United States increased from 16.1% before the war to 21.7%. In terms of imports, Japan's imports from the Asian market accounted for 51.7% of its total imports before the war, and in 1956 it fell to 32.4%; while imports from the United States increased from 24.9% to 33%. If we compare Japan's trade with the United States with trade with the socialist market, due to the US embargo policy, exports to the socialist market in 1956 only accounted for 2.8% of Japan's total exports, while the United States accounted for 21.7%. Imports from socialist countries accounted for 2.7% of Japan's total imports, while the United States accounted for 33%. Japan's trade with socialist countries is mainly with China. Japan and China have deep-rooted traditional trade relations. From 1930 to 1935, Japan's exports to China accounted for 16% of its total exports, but in 1956 it only accounted for 2.7%; imports fell from 12.6% from 1930 to 1935 to 2.6%.
    Due to this unnatural change, Japan's trade has experienced a large trade deficit every year. In 1956, Japan imported 1.06 billion US dollars from the United States, while Japan's exports to the United States were only 550 million US dollars, with a trade deficit of 510 million US dollars. Japan's total trade deficit last year was 700 million US dollars, mainly from trade with the United States. In the eleven years after the war, Japan's cumulative trade deficit with the United States was nearly 6 billion US dollars, and this trade deficit phenomenon is difficult to change in the future. Since the beginning of this year, the United States has widely launched a boycott of Japanese imports, and the US Congress is preparing to propose a comprehensive bill to restrict Japanese imports in the near future. This practice by the United States has caused anxiety and concern among Japan's large bourgeoisie. Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama also emphasized at a luncheon held by the Japan-US Association on August 9 that the United States' renewed tightening of the boycott of Japanese goods made him "feel worried."
    Japan imports 80% of its waste steel needs and 80% of its coking coal, 30% of its cotton, and 15% of its oil from the United States, as well as a large amount of wheat and soybeans. These materials used to be mostly imported from neighboring China and other Asian markets. This change only benefits the United States' control over Japan. Japan suffers a lot in terms of prices and freight, which puts Japan at a disadvantage in international market competition.
    Nobusuke Kishi Further Leans Towards the United States
    Faced with this crisis, the broad masses of the Japanese people and most of the bourgeoisie advocated breaking away from the United States and taking an independent and autonomous path to get rid of the threat of economic crisis; but Nobusuke Kishi and Japanese monopoly capitalists who have close ties with the United States are still betting on seeking assistance from the United States, advocating the use of further leaning towards the United States to solve the difficulties. Nobusuke Kishi's visits to Southeast Asia and the United States fully demonstrated a further leaning towards the United States. His words and actions during this period aroused opposition from the Japanese people and criticism from public opinion.
    The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet requested a total of 680 million US dollars in short-term and long-term loans from the United States this time, which is even larger than the total amount of loans from US banks to Japan by the end of 1956. What is especially important is the proposal of the "Southeast Asia Development Plan," which requires the United States to provide funds and Japan to provide technology to establish a "Southeast Asia Common Market" led by Japan. To this end, Nobusuke Kishi wore a pitiful smiling face and used remarks hostile to our country to please the United States. But what he got was just an abstract and empty Japan-US summit communiqué. Despite Nobusuke Kishi and his partners' best efforts to boast about the success of the visit to the United States, the Japanese people's reaction was completely different, and some even accused Nobusuke Kishi of being a "re-equipped Shigeru Yoshida." The September issue of "Sekai" magazine published a record of a symposium. The editorial department pointed out in the opening remarks: "Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States almost completely failed to express the hopes of the Japanese people, but instead brought the hopes of the United States back to Japan." Then, commentator Nagashima Matao pointed out: "This has greatly disappointed the Japanese people, not only gained nothing, but suffered losses." Fujita Nobuo, a commentary member of the Mainichi Shimbun, pointed out in the August issue of "Seikai Orai" that the withdrawal of US ground troops from Japan was already a set policy, and it was only announced by choosing the timing of the Japan-US negotiations. He said: "The Japanese not only do not think this is a gift from the United States, but are worried about the news that Japan's Self-Defense Forces will be strengthened and new weapons will be sent to South Korea."
    The dollar loan that Nobusuke Kishi obtained on this trip was actually already negotiated. This is the United States' attempt to further control Japan when the Japanese economy is in trouble. Japanese well-known economic commentator Hidezo Inaba said: "What I am most worried about is that the result of this expansion desire will lead to the loss of Japan's economic autonomy and political independence. If Japan truly demands independence, it should use all its strength to stabilize the balance of payments."
    Obviously, the "capital" that Nobusuke Kishi obtained during his visit to the United States has been rapidly lost under the criticism of domestic and foreign public opinion. In order to alleviate the pressure of public opinion and re-deceive the people's hearts that were lost due to Nobusuke Kishi's excessive flattery of the United States, Nobusuke Kishi and Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama successively met with domestic and foreign reporters on August 8 and 9, claiming that Japanese diplomacy had entered a new "turning point," and that in the future, "being a member of Asia should be one of its diplomatic policies," and that the United States and Western European countries should be informed of Asia's situation. However, sweet words cannot deceive public opinion. The "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial on August 10 specifically pointing out: "As long as Fujiyama follows in the footsteps of Nobusuke Kishi, Asian countries will never ask Japan to explain Asia's situation, and Japan will not have the power to persuade the United States and other countries."
    The Southeast Asia Development Plan is bound to fail
    Requesting "Southeast Asia Development Funds" was the central purpose of Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States. The Japan-US summit communiqué stated that it "will be studied," but in fact it is equivalent to having been rejected. Because at present, the competition among the major capitalist countries in the world to dominate and compete for markets is very fierce. Europe has established a common market, and the Asian market has become the target of joint competition among the United States, Britain, West Germany, and Japan. Nobusuke Kishi's wishful thinking was to use US funds and take advantage of his status as an Asian country to establish his own Asian market. Requesting US aid for this purpose is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger. "Jiji Tsushin" said on August 10: "In fact, the US government has long expressed 'considerable suspicion' and 'no confidence' in this plan, and is also unwilling to raise this issue when the Congress is clamoring to cut foreign aid fees. At present, the US Congress has formally decided to cut the Economic Development Loan Fund and only approved 500 million US dollars for the first year, and the second and third years have not been approved. This should be said to be a great blow to Nobusuke Kishi." Why is Nobusuke Kishi so confused that he doesn't even have this knowledge? This is nothing more than a fantasy to rebuild the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," but Japan lacks the strength at present, so he attempts to follow the old path of Germany after World War I, which has led to this ridiculous situation.
    From the fundamental conditions of Japan's foreign trade, Japan's industrial products can complement the raw materials of the Central and South American and African markets, but the distance is too far; the United States and Australia and New Zealand currently unilaterally supply Japan with surplus raw materials but do not want Japan's industrial products, which not only causes Japan to have a large trade deficit, but also makes Japan a competitor in exports; Western European countries are also Japan's competitors in imports and exports, only Asian countries are geographically closest to Japan, and the abundant raw materials there and Japan's industry can completely complement each other, which is extremely important to Japan. However, due to the control of the United States and Japan's wrong policies, the proportion of Japan's trade in the Asian market has not increased as quickly as that of European and American countries. The United States uses part of the yen obtained from selling surplus agricultural products to place orders in Southeast Asia, which is very detrimental to Japan's trade in Southeast Asia. This situation makes the Japanese economic community very worried, because it has made Japan an orphan in Asia. Although Japan's relations with Asian countries have improved after attending the Bandung Conference, Nobusuke Kishi has abandoned the Bandung spirit and wants to take the old path of imperialism, so he will definitely lose the Asian market he hopes for. Miura Ryoichi (Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Mainichi Shimbun), a reporter who accompanied Nobusuke Kishi on his visit to Southeast Asia, pointed out: No country truly welcomes Nobusuke Kishi. Even Thai newspapers say that the main purpose of the Japanese Prime Minister's visit to Southeast Asia is not so much to promote friendship with the countries concerned as to prepare for his visit to the United States and adjust Japan-US relations. Then he pointed out: Southeast Asian countries have long been wary of Japan's re-emergence as an Asian leader, suspecting that Japan's economic entry into Southeast Asia will be accompanied by political entry, and now the "Southeast Asia Development Fund" plan has become an empty check, and Nobusuke Kishi's weight in Southeast Asia has been further reduced.
    Many countries in Southeast Asia are newly emerging national independent countries after the war. They urgently need to improve their economic conditions. Therefore, in addition to self-reliance, they also urgently need foreign assistance, but they also demand equal and mutually beneficial conditions. The wishes expressed by other Asian countries and African countries are consistent with those of Southeast Asian countries. If Japan hopes to establish long-term and solid economic relations with them, it must become a member of them and truly cooperate with them on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
    However, Nobusuke Kishi's so-called "economic diplomacy" and his "Southeast Asia Development Plan" have rapidly developed into policies of anti-communism and opposition to neutralism during his visits to Southeast Asia and the United States. He openly sang the rhetoric of enmity with China and the Soviet Union and contrary to the nationalism of Southeast Asian countries in the United States, just wanting to please the United States wholeheartedly, and then hoping that the United States would give him funds and loans in order to realize the "Southeast Asia Development Plan." But just as the article signed G.B.T. in the August issue of "Bungei Shunju" said: "The stronger the reliance on the United States, the more it will not only arouse the resentment of the people, but also be snubbed in Southeast Asia."
    Two Paths for Japanese Economic Development
    Nobusuke Kishi was once a bureaucrat who ruled the puppet state of Manchuria in Japan, and also the Minister of Commerce and Industry and Minister of State in the Tojo Cabinet that launched the Pacific War. People say that he is very "smart" and "knows" the economy, but from his recent words and deeds, one cannot help but say that he is extremely unwise. He is ignorant of the changes in international power after World War II; ignorant of the feelings of the Japanese people and the trends of Japanese public opinion after the lessons of defeat; and has no reflection on his own bureaucratic thoughts of a defeated aggressor. Therefore, under the guise of "economic diplomacy," he adopted the policy of distant alliance and near attack leading to war that has repeatedly failed in Japanese history, and sang the rhetoric of anti-communism and anti-neutralism. But everyone knows that although Nobusuke Kishi claims that he and the United States are both "liberal countries," it is the United States, a "liberal country," that rides on the heads of the Japanese people, not others. The powerful Soviet Union and the standing up China will never allow the invasion of Japanese militarism, and the revived nationalist countries in Southeast Asia are guarding against the revival of Japanese militarism. They will never welcome Eastern imperialism after expelling Western imperialism. Therefore, Nobusuke Kishi's set of arrogant ambitions will definitely fail. This path of Japanese economic development is impassable.
    What is the other path of Japanese economic development? That is the path of independence, autonomy and peace. Japan should return to the big family of Asia and carry out friendly cooperation in accordance with the wishes of Asian countries. At the same time, it is necessary to establish equal and mutually beneficial economic relations with China and the Soviet Union, which advocate peaceful coexistence. After the Second World War, Asian countries have formed a powerful emerging group, which, together with the emerging countries in Africa, has become a force that cannot be ignored. Only by standing together with Asian and African countries can Japan get rid of the unequal situation imposed on Japan by the United States and establish truly mutually beneficial and mutually beneficial economic relations. This is beneficial to Japanese economic development. However, if Japan continues to follow the United States and revive the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" policy, it will only make Japan's subordinate status dependent on the United States deeper and deeper. Nobusuke Kishi's policies of anti-communism, anti-neutralism, revising the constitution, and rearming will inevitably be opposed by the Japanese people and condemned by the people of Asia and the world, and the result will be self-defeating.

　　日本国际收支的危机和日本经济发展的两条道路
　　白禾
    日本国际收支的危机
    去年7月日本经济企划厅发表了1956年度经济白皮书，特别指出“日本已经结束了战后的恢复时期”，接着还说日本经济将继续繁荣。这时日本社会上就有人说这是自神武天皇以来的空前繁荣，即所谓“神武景气”。但是从今年年初日本的国际收支即开始露出破绽，进出口失掉平衡，入超不断上升，到今年7月已达十一亿四千五百万美元，超过了前次危机1953年度的十一亿三千五百万美元。到今年6月为止，国际收支赤字达五亿二千万美元，外汇库存只有八亿七千万美元。其中除去印度尼西亚、南朝鲜和阿根廷等国所欠的贸易呆账
  （二亿七千万美元）和外国银行暂时延期支付款项，日本所能支配的外汇还不足三亿美元。日本经济学家们说，这比1953年的危机还要坏，因为现在比当时的经济规模要大得多。
    日本大藏相一万田尚登最近说，今年国际收支赤字能争取停在四亿至五亿美元便是最好的。为此，日本银行已两次提高放款利率、收紧银根。在岸信介访美之前，日本内阁会议（6月14日）匆匆决定了八项“经济综合对策”，6月19日又制定五项“紧急对策”，尽量设法限制进口，扩大出口，向外借款，压制投资。
    在这一连串的紧缩政策下，经济上不健康的因素便暴露得更加明显：（一）市场空头支票泛滥，今年5月东京一地就出现五万九千多张，共十五亿余日元，7月份又增至六万多张，成为战后最高纪录。（二）股票下跌，据东京证券交易所的平均数字，7月份已降至四百七十日元，较5月4日的最高价格五百九十五日元降低近20％。（三）中小企业倒风转剧，今年上半年纺织工业倒闭的达三百一十件，与去年同期比较，件数增加两倍，负债额增加三倍，7月份又增加七十多件，打破了1954年2月以来的纪录。（四）物价暴跌，一些部门开始生产过剩，如截至7月为止，人造丝由去年12月的每磅二百五十日元降至一百六十七日元。为缓和危机，各企业正相继缩短工作时间。此外，战后一直在上升的工矿业生产6月份已呈现下降趋势。据日本经济企划厅统计，6月份的工矿业生产指数为二五五·八（1934—1936年＝100），较5月份降低1.1％。上述趋势下半年将更加严重。日本财阀们纷纷高叫振兴输出，打开目前的困难局面，社会上也在喊“神武不景气”了。
    不出一年，日本经济何以现出这样神经病似的一喜一忧，人们都不免感到奇怪。但是仔细分析，这并没什么奇怪，这就是战后日本经济发展道路上的根本问题的爆发。
    造成日本国际收支危机的原因
    由于美国的控制，战后日本贸易构成发生了不自然的变化。尽管日本经济已经恢复而且有了发展，但到1956年对外贸易出口才恢复到战前的86％，而进口却比战前增加了14％。
    日本是一个依靠海外贸易的国家，去年进口三十二亿美元，其中原料和燃料占72％；食品占17％；而出口则几乎完全是制成品。根据这些特点，日本和亚洲市场有着天然的结合条件，战前日本对亚洲市场的出口占其出口总额的62.9％，但1956年降为40.9％；而对美国的出口则从战前的16.1％上升到21.7％。进口方面，战前日本从亚洲市场的进口占其进口总额的51.7％，1956年降为32.4％；而从美国的进口则从24.9％上升到33％。如果以日本对美贸易和对社会主义市场贸易比较，由于美国的禁运政策，1956年对社会主义市场的出口只占日本出口总额的2.8％，而美国则占21.7％。从社会主义国家进口占日本进口总额的2.7％，而美国则占33％。日本对社会主义国家贸易主要是对我国。日本和我国有着深远的传统贸易关系，1930年至1935年间，日本对我出口占其出口总额的16％，1956年只占2.7％；进口方面则从1930年至1935年的12.6％降为2.6％。
    由于这种不自然的改变，日本贸易每年出现大量入超，1956年日本自美国进口十亿六千万美元，而日本对美出口仅五亿五千万美元，入超五亿一千万美元。日本去年总入超七亿美元，主要来自对美贸易。战后十一年间，日本对美入超累计近六十亿美元，今后这种入超现象也难于改变。而今年以来，美国广泛展开了抵制日货进口运动，美国国会准备在最近提出全面的限制日货进口法案。美国这种作法引起了日本大资产阶级的焦虑和担心。日本外相藤山爱一郎在出席8月9日召开的日美协会午餐会时也强调指出，美国重新加紧抵制日货使他不能不“感到忧虑”。
    日本自美国进口占其需要量80％的废铁和80％的炼焦煤、30％的棉花、15％的石油，还有很大数量的小麦和大豆。这些物资从前大部分是从邻近的中国和其他亚洲市场进口的。这种变化只利于美国对日本的控制，价格和运费上日本吃亏很多，因而使日本在国际市场竞争上处于不利地位。
    岸信介进一步向美国投靠
    面对着这一危机，日本广大人民和大部分资产阶级主张摆脱美国走独立自主的道路，以摆脱经济危机的威胁；但岸信介和与美国关系密切的日本垄断资本家们却仍然把赌注押在对美求援上，主张用进一步投靠美国的办法来解决困难。岸信介访问东南亚和访问美国充分表现了进一步向美投靠，他在这一时期的言论和行动引起了日本国民的反对和舆论界的抨击。
    岸信介内阁此次向美国要求短期和长期贷款共达六亿八千万美元，比到1956年底美国各银行对日贷款总数还要大。尤其重要的是提出“东南亚开发计划”，要美国出钱，日本出技术，以建立一个以日本为首的“东南亚共同市场”。为此岸信介摆着一副可怜的笑脸，并以敌视我国的言论讨美国的喜欢。但他得到的不过是一篇抽象空洞的日美会谈公报而已。尽管岸信介及其伙伴竭力吹嘘访美的成功，日本国民的反应却截然不同，甚至有人指斥岸信介为“改装了的吉田茂”。“世界”杂志9月号发表了一篇座谈会的纪录，编辑部在开场白中指出：“岸信介访美几乎完全没有表达日本国民的希望，而是把美国的希望带回日本来了”。接着评论家长岛又男指出：“这使日本国民非常失望，不仅一无所获，反而有所损失。”每日新闻论说委员藤田信男在“政界往来”8月号上指出，美国从日本撤退地面部队本是既定方针，只是选择日美谈判的时机把它发表了。他说：“日本人不但不认为这是美国给予的礼物，倒是担心随之而来的日本自卫队的增强和向南朝鲜送入新武器的消息。”
    岸信介此行所得到的美元贷款实际上也是早已谈妥的。这是美国企图乘日本经济困难的时候进一步控制日本。日本著名经济评论家稻叶秀三说：“我最担心的是这种扩张欲望驱使的结果，会使日本的经济自主和政治独立趋向丧失。日本如果真正要求独立，就应用自己的全付力量来稳定国际收支。”
    显然，岸信介访美所得到的“资本”，在国内外舆论的抨击下已迅速丧失。岸信介和日本外相藤山爱一郎为缓和舆论压力，重新骗取由于岸信介过于媚美而失掉的人心，相继于8月8、9日接见了国内外记者，声称日本外交已进入一个新的“转折点”，今后要以“作亚洲的一员为其外交方针之一”，要向美国和西欧各国说明亚洲的处境。然而花言巧语欺骗不了舆论。8月10日的“朝日新闻”特为此发表社论指出：“只要藤山走岸信介的老路，亚洲国家决不会请日本说明亚洲的处境，日本也不可能有说服美国及其他国家的力量。”
    东南亚开发计划必将失败
    要求“东南亚开发资金”是岸信介访美的中心目的。日美会谈公报对此表示“将予以研究”，而实际上等于已经拒绝。因为目前世界几个主要资本主义国家霸占和争夺市场的竞争非常激烈，欧洲建立了共同市场，亚洲市场则成为美、英、西德、日本共同角逐的目标。岸信介的如意算盘是想借美国资金，利用自己是亚洲国家的地位，建立自己的亚洲市场。在此目的下要求美援等于与虎谋皮。8月10日的“时事通信”说：“实际上美国政府对此计划早就表示‘相当怀疑’和‘没有信心’，同时也不愿在国会吵着要削减对外援助费时提出这一问题。目前美国会已正式决定削减经济开发借款基金，仅通过了第一年度的五亿美元，第二、三年度均未通过。这对岸信介应该说是一个极大的打击。”岸信介为什么糊涂到连这一点知识都没有呢？这无非是妄想重建“大东亚共荣圈”，而目前日本又缺乏力量，因此企图走第一次大战后德国的老路，以致弄到这种可笑的地步。
    从日本对外贸易的根本条件来看，日本的工业制品可以同中南美和非洲市场的原料互相补充，但距离太远；美国和澳洲、新西兰地区各国目前单方供给日本剩余原料却不要日本的工业制品，因此不仅使日本造成很大入超，而且是日本在输出上的竞争者；西欧各国在进出口上也都是日本的竞争者，只有亚洲各国地理上与日本最接近，那里的丰富原料和日本的工业完全可以互相补充，对日本是极端重要的。但是由于美国的控制和日本的错误政策，日本在亚洲市场的贸易所占比重反而不及欧美各国增加得快。美国利用出售剩余农产品所得的一部分日元在日本订货转向东南亚，对日本在东南亚的贸易非常不利。这种情况使日本经济界十分担心，因为它已使日本陷于亚洲孤儿的地位。虽然日本出席万隆会议之后和亚洲各国的关系有了好转，但岸信介却抛弃了万隆精神要走帝国主义的老路，因此他就必定失掉他所希望的亚洲市场。岸信介访问东南亚时的随行记者三浦良一（“每日新闻”政治部副部长）指出：没有一个国家是真实欢迎岸信介的，连泰国的报纸都说日本首相访问东南亚的主要目的与其说是与有关各国促进友好，还不如说是为访美和调整日美关系作准备。接着他又指出：东南亚国家早就戒备着日本要重新以亚洲指导者的面目出现，怀疑日本对东南亚的经济进出将伴随着政治进出，现在“东南亚开发资金”的计划又成了空头支票，岸信介在东南亚的重量就更加减轻了。
    东南亚许多国家是战后新兴的民族独立国家，它们极需改善自己的经济条件，因此除了自力更生以外也极需外国的援助，但是他们更要求平等互利的条件。其他亚洲国家和非洲的国家和东南亚国家所表达的愿望是一致的，日本如果希望与它们建立长期巩固的经济关系，则必须成为它们中间的一员，真正与它们在平等互利的基础上合作。
    但是，岸信介的所谓“经济外交”和他的“东南亚开发计划”在他访问东南亚和美国期间，已经迅速地发展为反共和反对中立主义的政策。他在美国公然唱出与中苏为敌和与东南亚各国民族主义相违背的滥调，无非是想一心一意讨美国的欢心，然后希望美国给他资金和贷款，以便实现“开发东南亚计划”。但是正像“文艺春秋”8月号署名G．B．T的文章所说：“依靠美国越强，不仅引起国民的反感，在东南亚也要受到冷遇”。
    日本经济发展的两条道路
    岸信介曾是日本统治伪满洲国的官僚，也是发动太平洋战争的东条内阁的商工大臣和国务大臣，人们都说他很“聪明”，而且“通晓”经济，但是从他最近的言行上看，又不能不说他是极不明智的。他对于第二次世界大战以后国际力量的变化茫然无知；对于经过战败教训的日本国民的心情和日本舆论界的动向茫然无知；对于自己曾为一个战败了的侵略主义的官僚思想上毫无反省。因此他才在“经济外交”的幌子下，采取了在日本历史上反复失败了的远交近攻走向战争的政策，唱出反共、反中立主义的滥调。但是尽人皆知，尽管岸信介自称和美国同是“自由主义国家”，然而骑在日本人头上的是“自由主义国家”的美国而不是其它。强大的苏联和站起来了的中国再也不允许日本军国主义的侵犯，复兴了的东南亚各民族主义国家在警惕着日本军国主义的复活。它们决不会在驱除西方帝国主义之后而欢迎东方的帝国主义进来，因此岸信介的这一套狂妄野心肯定地要归于失败。日本经济发展的这一条道路是走不通的。
    日本经济发展的另一条道路是什么呢？那便是独立自主和和平的道路。日本应当回到亚洲的大家庭来，根据亚洲各国的愿望来进行友好合作。同时要和主张和平共处的中国、苏联建立平等互利的经济关系。亚洲各国在第二次大战以后，已经形成了一个有力的新兴集团，和非洲的新兴各国连在一起成为一个不可忽视的力量。日本只有和亚非各国站在一起，才可以摆脱美国强加于日本的不平等处境，并可以建立真正互通有无、平等互惠的经济关系。这对日本经济发展是有利的。但是日本如继续追随美国，复活“大东亚共荣圈”政策，则只能使日本依附美国的隶属地位越陷越深。而岸信介的反共、反中立主义和修改宪法、重新武装的政策必将遭到日本国民的反对和亚洲人民、世界人民的指斥，其结果将是自取失败的。
