    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 31st: After achieving a brilliant record of six wins in six games in Romania, the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August First" Basketball Team left Romania today and headed to Czechoslovakia to continue its friendly visit.
    During its matches in Romania, the "August First" Basketball Team did not have the opportunity to play against the Romanian national team (currently visiting abroad). However, its opponents were not weak. Among them, the Romanian National Youth Team was composed of the best youth players under the age of twenty-five. They had competed in Italy in May of this year and had considerable international competition experience. Three of the four city representative teams from Romania that the Chinese team faced were Romanian Class A basketball teams.
    Throughout the competition in Romania, the "August First" Basketball Team players maintained a high level of fighting spirit, played skillfully and tenaciously, fully demonstrated their collective strength, and flexibly utilized tactics that combined offense and defense. They successfully adopted man-to-man marking, zone defense, and fast break tactics. The team's strength was also well-organized in terms of player arrangement. A Romanian national referee believed that the "August First" team was the most successful Chinese basketball team to compete in Romania in recent years.

    我八一篮球队在罗受到赞扬
    据新华社布加勒斯特31日电  中国人民解放军“八一”篮球队在罗马尼亚创造了六战六捷的辉煌战果后，今天离开罗马尼亚，前往捷克斯洛伐克继续进行访问比赛。
    “八一”篮球队在罗马尼亚的历次比赛中，虽然没有获得同罗马尼亚国家代表队（现在国外访问）比赛的机会，但是，它的对手们并不弱。其中，罗马尼亚国家青年队是二十五岁以下的最优秀的青年选手组成的。他们曾经在今年5月间到意大利比赛过，具有相当丰富的国际比赛经验。中国队的对手罗马尼亚四个市代表队中有三个是罗马尼亚的甲级篮球队。
    “八一”篮球队队员在罗马尼亚的整个比赛过程中，保持着高度的战斗情绪，打得巧妙顽强，充分地发挥了集体力量，灵活地运用了进攻和防守相结合的战术，成功地采取了人钉人、区域防守和快攻的战法。在队员力量的配备上，也组织得很好。一位罗马尼亚国家裁判认为，“八一”队是几年来中国到罗马尼亚比赛的篮球队中最成功的一个。
