　　Meeting of Veteran Wrestlers
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Liao Youbin Shi Yunzi
　　At the Eleven Cities and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Workers' Wrestling Competition, Song Zhenfu, a famous Shanghai wrestler, happily met his two Hui ethnic old friends from more than twenty years ago: Zhang Hongyu from Tianjin and Cui Fengqi from Jinan. They came together from all over the country with three different teams to meet in this "Blue City" (Hohhot).
　　When Song Zhenfu and Cui Fengqi, two gray-haired old men, met, they were truly overcome with mixed emotions. Twenty-one years ago in winter, Song Zhenfu, a young itinerant performer, traveled south from Beijing with his family. When he passed through Jinan, Shandong, he was starving, freezing, and at the end of his rope, when he met Cui Fengqi, a folk martial arts enthusiast. Cui Fengqi enthusiastically helped Song Zhenfu set up a stall to perform and gave him travel expenses to continue his journey south to make a living. Later, Song Zhenfu settled down in Shanghai and often fondly remembered this precious friendship he had found while traveling. At this meeting, Song Zhenfu excitedly told Cui Fengqi that everything has changed! Since Shanghai's liberation, his eldest son, Baosheng, has been nurtured by the state and has already graduated from university. Last year, he became the national featherweight wrestling champion and is now a competition technical instructor at the Shanghai Sports Commission, enjoying lecturer status. His other three children are studying at medical colleges and middle schools, and some have become state cadres. As for Song Zhenfu himself, who suffered all kinds of torment in the old society for thirty years as an itinerant performer, he has been respected by the Communist Party and the People's Government for the past eight years. He has been invited to be a worker wrestling technical instructor, wrestling competition referee, and is currently a preparatory committee member of the Shanghai Wrestling and Boxing Sports Association.
　　Cui Fengqi, 53, is now an accountant at the Jinan Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company. He works during the day and teaches wrestling techniques to some workers in the evening, training a new generation of wrestling athletes.
　　Zhang Hongyu, a famous figure in Tianjin's martial arts circles, also expressed his pleasure at the happy later years of each other when he and Song Zhenfu were reunited after a long separation. He is now an instructor at the Tianjin Sports Commission, helping factories train amateur wrestlers.
　　These three veteran wrestlers have trained more than two hundred worker wrestlers in recent years. Some of their students have won various levels of championships and sportsmanship honors in the 1953 National Ethnic Sports Performance Competition, the 1956 National Wrestling Championships, and this Workers' Wrestling Competition.

    摔跤老将们的会见
    新华社记者　廖由滨　石云子
    在十一城市及内蒙古自治区职工摔跤比赛运动会上，上海市摔跤运动名将宋振甫，同他二十多年前的两位回族老朋友——天津市的张洪玉和济南市的崔凤岐，愉快地会见了。他们分别随同三个代表队从天南地北来到这个“蓝色的城”（呼和浩特）会师。
    当宋振甫和崔凤岐这两位头发花白的老人见面时，他们真是悲喜交织，百感俱生。二十一年前的冬天，年轻的江湖卖艺人宋振甫，从北京带着家小南下，路过山东济南，正当挨饿受冻、穷途末路的时候，遇见了民间武艺爱好者崔凤岐。崔凤岐热情地帮助宋振甫设摊卖艺，并赠送路费让他继续奔向江南谋生。以后宋振甫在上海安家立业，经常怀念着这份流浪途中得到的珍贵友谊。这次见面时，宋振甫兴奋地对崔凤岐说，现在一切都变了样！自从上海解放以后，他的大儿子宝生，经过国家培养，已经在大学毕业，去年成了全国次轻量级摔跤冠军，现在上海市体育运动委员会担任竞赛技术指导员，享受讲师待遇。其余三个子女有的在医学院和中学读书，有的已成为国家干部。而流浪江湖三十年受够旧社会百般折磨的宋振甫自己，八年来也一直受到共产党和人民政府的尊重。他先后被邀请为职工摔跤技术指导、摔跤运动会裁判，目前担任着上海市摔跤拳术体育协会筹备委员。
    五十三岁的崔凤岐，现在是济南市水产供销公司会计，他白天工作，晚上向一些职工传授摔跤技术，培养新一代摔跤健儿。
    天津市武艺界名人张洪玉同宋振甫久别重逢时，也对各人幸福的晚年表示欣慰。他现在天津市体育运动委员会担任指导员，帮助各工厂培养业余摔跤手。
    这三位摔跤老将最近几年来已经培养了二百多名职工摔跤运动员。他们的学生中间，有一部分人已在1953年全国民族形式体育表演竞赛会、1956年全国摔跤锦标赛和这次职工摔跤比赛会上，分别获得各级冠军和运动健将的荣誉。
