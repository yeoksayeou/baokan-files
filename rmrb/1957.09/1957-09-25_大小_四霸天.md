    The Big and Small "Four Overlords"
    Jin Zhen
    “Peng Gong An” features the “Big Four Overlords,” all of whom are figures who dominated their respective areas and divided the spoils locally. Their four sons also have the title of "Little Four Overlords."
    Before liberation, these big and small “Four Overlords” who rode roughshod over the people and occupied their respective territories were truly everywhere. After liberation, through a series of movements, the rural despots, the urban foremen, and other "Four Overlord"-style figures were overthrown. But now, many right-wing elements still dream of becoming "Four Overlords"!
    Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji wanted to be the "Big Four Overlords." They dreamed of establishing a bourgeois kingdom in our country and ruling as despots. There are even more people who want to be the "Little Four Overlords," such as the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique in literary and art circles, the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique in art circles, Chu Anping, Xu Zhucheng, Wang Zhong, etc., in journalistic circles, Zhong Dianfei, Wu Yin, etc., in the film industry, Wu Zuguang, etc., in the theater industry, Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, etc., in scientific circles, Qian Duansheng, Lou Bangyan, etc., in political and legal circles, Li Zongen, etc., in the medical field, Lin Handa, Tao Dayong, etc., in education circles… They all want to establish their own independent kingdoms in this or that field and become petty tyrants. They clamor that the Party cannot lead them and demand that the Party withdraw from here and withdraw from there. Ding Cong, the "king" of the pictorial world "kingdom," even said that the publications they ran, "no matter where they are published, do not allow the Communist Party to 'interfere in internal affairs'." How clearly he puts it! The People's Republic of China led by the Communist Party is one country, and his independent kingdom is also a country. Your country cannot "interfere" in the "internal affairs" of my "country"!
    "Small as the sparrow is, it has all the vital organs." These "independent kingdoms" not only have "internal affairs" but also their own "diplomacy" and other institutions. Doesn’t Wu Zuguang's "small family" have people in charge of "internal affairs," "diplomacy," and "political work"?
    Tragically, although these "kingdoms" have "kings," a small group of civil and military "officials," and so-called "governing programs," they have no people. All the Chinese people are unwilling to be their subjects. Their "kingdoms" are suspended in the air, and with the great wind of the anti-Rightist struggle, they have all collapsed one by one.

### 大小“四霸天”

    大小“四霸天”
    金真
    “彭公案”上有“大四霸天”，他们都是独霸一方，坐地分赃的人物。他们的四个儿子也有“小四霸天”的称号。
    解放前，这种骑在人民头上的各据一方的大小“四霸天”，真是举目皆是。解放后，经过一系列的运动，农村的恶霸，城市的把头等等“四霸天”式的人物是被反掉了，但现在许多右派分子却还梦想做“四霸天”哩！
    想做“大四霸天”的有章伯钧和罗隆基，他们梦想在我国建立资产阶级王国，称孤道寡。想做“小四霸天”的就更多了，如丁陈反党集团在文艺界，江丰反党集团在美术界，储安平、徐铸成、王中等在新闻界，钟惦棐、吴茵等在电影界，吴祖光等在戏剧界，曾昭抡、费孝通等在科学界，钱端升、楼邦彦等在政法界，李宗恩等在医药界，林汉达、陶大镛等在教育界……他们都想在这一界或那一界建立自己的独立王国，当小霸王。他们叫嚣说党不能领导他们，要叫党退出这里，退出那里。画报界“王国”的“国王”丁聪甚至说，他们办的同人刊物“无论在哪里出版，都不容许共产党来‘干涉内政’”。说得多明白！共产党领导的中华人民共和国是一国，他的独立王国也是一国，你这一国不能“干涉”我这一“国”的“内政”！
    “麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全”，这些“独立王国”不仅有“内政”，而且有自己的“外交”等等机构，吴祖光“小家族”不是就有人分管“内政”、“外交”和“政治工作”事宜么？
    可悲的是，这些“王国”虽然有了“国王”，有一小撮文武“官员”，也有所谓“施政纲领”，可就是没有人民，全中国人民都不愿做他们的属下之民，他们的“王国”是悬在空中的，经反右派的大风一吹，就都一个个地倒塌下来了。
