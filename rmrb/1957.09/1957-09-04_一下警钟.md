    A Warning Bell
    When the fascist originator Mussolini was alive, he once instructed his party members: "If I advance, you follow me; if I retreat, you kill me; if I fall in battle, everyone avenge me."
    More than twenty years ago, Mussolini blew the horn of advancement—launching a war of aggression for external expansion. The Italian fascists closely followed him. A few years later, his aggressive cause failed. This "black-shirted eccentric" wanted to cross the border and escape, but his party members did not kill him. Instead, Italian patriots hanged him from a tree in Milan. His dirty corpse was placed in a monastery near Milan, subjected to the people's contempt.
    However, fascism did not die with Mussolini. Over the years, with the connivance and nurturing of the Italian ruling group, fascist bacteria have multiplied in this country. New and old fascists have recently become rampant to an alarming extent. On August 31, they even held a reburial for Mussolini's corpse and took the opportunity to launch a fascist demonstration. They hung the former Fascist Party flag in the chapel where Mussolini's coffin was placed in Predappio, wore black shirt uniforms to keep vigil, and even publicly swore before Mussolini's spirit to continue to follow the "leader's" teachings.
    These fascists are obviously overwhelmed by the policies of reactionary groups at home and abroad, thinking that the time for a comeback is approaching. They have forgotten that there are millions of progressive people in Italy, including the patriots who executed Mussolini and their successors. In any case, the fascist demonstration is not a bad thing, because it is tantamount to ringing a warning bell to the Italians, telling them: "People, be vigilant!" (Rui)

    一下警钟
    法西斯的鼻祖墨索里尼活着的时候，曾对他的党徒训示：“假使我向前，你们跟我；假使我退却，你们杀我；假使我阵亡，大家来为我报仇”。
    二十多年前，墨索里尼吹响了前进的号角——发动了对外扩张的侵略战争，意大利的法西斯党徒紧紧地跟随着他。几年之后，他的侵略事业失败了，这个“黑衫怪杰”想偷越国境逃跑，他的党徒并没有杀死他，是意大利的爱国者把他吊死在米兰的树上。他的肮脏的尸体停放在米兰附近的一个修道院里，受尽人民的唾弃。
    但是法西斯主义并没有和墨索里尼一起死去。这些年来，在意大利统治集团的纵容和培育下，法西斯细菌在这个国家中得到了繁衍。新的和旧的法西斯分子最近猖獗到可惊的程度。8月31日，他们居然给墨索里尼的尸体举行迁葬，并且借机会发动了一次法西斯示威。他们在普累达庇阿市停放墨索里尼棺木的礼拜堂挂起了前法西斯党旗，穿上黑衫党的制服来守灵，甚至在墨索里尼的灵前公开宣誓，要继续遵循“元首”的遗训。
    这些法西斯分子显然是被意大利国内外反动集团的政策冲昏了头脑，以为卷土重来的时机已经迫近了。他们忘记了在意大利还有着千百万进步的人民。有着曾经处死墨索里尼的爱国者和他们的后继人。不管怎么样，法西斯党徒们的示威倒不是一件坏事，因为它无异向意大利人敲了一下警钟，告诉他们：“人们，你们要警惕！”（瑞）
