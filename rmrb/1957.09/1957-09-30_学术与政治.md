Academic and Political

Lin Yushi

Political struggle is the direct manifestation of class struggle, a matter of us versus them. On political issues, we advocate clearly distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, because it belongs to the struggle outside the people, a life-or-death struggle.

Academic pursuits, in the final analysis, serve politics. "Academic pursuits for the sake of academic pursuits" and apolitical academic pursuits do not exist. Academic debates sometimes directly or indirectly reflect class struggle. But it ultimately belongs to the struggle on the ideological front. Within the people, on ideological issues, we advocate freedom of independent thinking, freedom of debate, and freedom of criticism and self-criticism.

We advocate that there must be freedom of academic thought within the people because it is necessary for the prosperity of literature and art, the development of science, and the development of truth. We also advocate that we must clearly distinguish between ourselves and the enemy in politics and implement dictatorship over counter-revolutionary elements because it is necessary to safeguard the independence and prosperity of the motherland and the freedom and happiness of the people. This is a line that cannot be confused.

However, bourgeois rightists are doing their utmost to blur this line to facilitate their heinous anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

When the Communist Party's rectification movement began, bourgeois rightists tried their best to interpret the academic and cultural policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" as a political slogan. They called all kinds of reactionary remarks against the Communist Party and against socialism "blooming" and "contending," and made a big fuss about whether the weather was "cold" or "warm." Even more viciously, bourgeois rightists only allowed themselves to launch frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism, saying that this was "blooming"; they did not allow the Party and the people to counter-criticize them, calling counter-criticism "closing," in order to shut the mouths of the Party and the people. The rightist Wu Jingchao openly proposed at a forum on the hundred schools of thought contention held by the "Contention" monthly magazine in March that "the hundred schools of thought contention should preferably be linked to the task of mutual supervision," and said that the contention must be "aimed at the current major national affairs." This is a typical example of deliberately blurring the boundaries between politics and academia.

But when the counter-revolutionary political conspiracy was exposed, and the hope of bourgeois restoration had become a bubble, these rightist gentlemen tried their best to describe political issues as academic and ideological issues. To give an example, the same Wu Jingchao confessed at a recent symposium held by the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences: "After the policy of a hundred schools of thought contention was put forward last year, I did not understand the hundred schools of thought contention correctly. I thought that sociology was also one school, and it should be taken out to contend." You see, his "restoration of sociology" was originally in response to the call of "a hundred schools of thought contention." How can he be regarded as a political rightist? What are the facts? Wu Jingchao is not only a core figure in Luo Longji's think tank (Luo's main anti-Party remarks were discussed with him), a contributor to Zhang Bojun's "political design institute," and a participant in the June 6th conspiracy meeting, but also a planner of the bourgeois sociology restoration activities. He was the one who issued the signal flare for "restoring" sociology in the New Construction magazine at the beginning of the year—"Does sociology still have a place in New China?" He was also the one who strongly advocated establishing four sociology departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu at the June 9th meeting, and strived to set up the department first at Renmin University. Did the policy of "a hundred schools of thought contention" ever call on anyone to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois sociology restoration activities? But why did he have to involve "a hundred schools of thought contention"? The rightists' strategy is very insidious. They believe that doing so will not only make it easier to confuse the public and win social sympathy, but also release a poisonous arrow to the "hundred schools of thought contention" policy: "Either you insist on the 'hundred schools of thought contention' policy and treat my reactionary activities as academic issues; or you declare that there is no freedom of academic thought, and 'a hundred schools of thought contention' is just a deceiving ghost story."

We sternly warn the rightists: your conspiracies and tricks are in vain. Political rightists are one thing, and academic and ideological issues are another. The "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward by the Communist Party in academic culture is an unswerving policy. It was this policy in the past, it is this policy now, and it will be this policy in the future. Taking bourgeois sociology as an example, the Communist Party has always regarded it as a reactionary theory that defends the capitalist system and serves the bourgeois rule, and is incompatible with Marxism. However, in order to implement the policy of "a hundred schools of thought contention," for those who have studied sociology in the past, although it is clear that they still have serious bourgeois erroneous views in their academic thoughts, before they are found to have engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, we not only give them job positions suitable for them, but also encourage them to actively participate in academic debates and carry out self-reform. Many newspapers and periodicals have published their articles, and many units have invited them to seminars. We even actively help them create conditions, hoping that they can conduct some research that is beneficial to society.

But the bourgeois rightists have other intentions. Originally, they attempted to take advantage of the people's trust in them, to use the guise of academic research, and to traffic the private goods of bourgeois sociology restoration behind the guise. Today, their political conspiracies have been exposed, and these political careerists have become the objects of struggle. Who can be blamed for this? Is it the fault of the "hundred schools of thought contention" policy?

Perhaps some people will ask: Does this mean that we will change our attitude towards sociology from now on? Will we no longer allow the study of sociology? No. As an academic issue, we still adopt the policy of "a hundred schools of thought contention" towards sociology. Even if someone defends bourgeois sociology now or in the future, as long as he is not a counter-revolutionary in politics, we will still allow him the freedom of debate. Because that belongs to the scope of academic thought, it is a matter within the people.

    学术与政治
    林聿时
    政治斗争是阶级斗争的直接表现形式，是敌我问题。在政治问题上，我们主张必须分清敌我，因为它是属于人民外部的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。
    学术，归根结蒂是为政治服务的。“为学术而学术”、超政治的学术，是不存在的。学术上的争论有时也直接或间接地反映阶级斗争。但它毕竟属于思想战线上的斗争。在人民内部，思想问题我们主张有独立思考的自由，有争辩的自由。有批评与反批评的自由。
    我们之所以主张在人民内部一定要有学术思想的自由，因为它是繁荣文学艺术、发展科学、发展真理所必需的。我们又主张政治上必须分清敌我，对反革命分子一定要实行专政，因为它是保障祖国的独立富强，保障人民的自由幸福所必需的。这是一条不容混淆的界线。
    但是资产阶级右派分子却竭力混淆这一条界线，以便利他们进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。
    当共产党整风运动开始的时候，资产阶级右派分子曾经竭力把“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的学术文化政策解释为政治口号。他们把各色各样反对共产党、反对社会主义的反动言论都叫做“鸣”，都叫做“放”，并且在天气“寒”“暖”问题上大做文章。更加恶毒的是资产阶级右派分子只许他们对党对社会主义进行疯狂的攻击，说这就是“放”；不许党和人民对他们进行反批评，把反批评叫做“收”，好把党和人民的口封住。右派分子吴景超3月间在“争鸣”月刊召开的关于百家争鸣的座谈会上就公然提出“百家争鸣最好能与互相监督的任务联系起来”，并且说，争鸣必须“针对着目前的国家大事而发”。这是有意混淆政治与学术界限的典型例子。
    但是当反革命的政治阴谋被揭穿，资产阶级复辟的希望已成泡影的时候，这些右派先生们又极力把政治问题说成是学术思想问题了。顺便举一个例子。就是同一个吴景超在哲学社会科学部最近召开的座谈会上交代说：“去年百家争鸣方针提出后，我对百家争鸣体会得不对，认为社会学也是一家，也应拿出来争鸣一下。”你看，他“恢复社会学”原来是响应“百家争鸣”的号召，这怎能把他当作政治上的右派呢？事实是怎样呢？吴景超不但是罗隆基智囊团的核心人物（罗的主要反党言论都是和他商量过的），是章伯钧“政治设计院”的献策者，是六六阴谋会议参加者，而且是资产阶级社会学复辟活动的策划者。年初在新建设杂志发出“恢复”社会学信号弹——“社会学在新中国还有地位吗？”——的就是他。在六九会议上，极力主张在北京、上海、广州、成都搞四个社会学系，并且力争在人民大学首先设系的也是他。难道“百家争鸣”的方针曾经号召过谁去搞反党反社会主义的资产阶级社会学复辟活动吗？但是他为什么一定要牵扯到“百家争鸣”上来？右派分子之所以采取这种策略，居心是很毒辣的。他们认为这样做，既便于混淆视听，争取社会同情，又可以对“百家争鸣”政策放出一枝毒箭：“要嘛，你就坚持‘百家争鸣’政策，把我的反动活动当作学术问题处理；要嘛，你就宣布学术思想上没有自由，‘百家争鸣’只是一句骗人的鬼话。”
    我们正告右派分子：你们这些阴谋诡计是白费心思的。政治上的右派是一回事，学术思想上的问题又是一回事。共产党在学术文化上提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，是坚定不移的方针。过去是这方针，现在是这方针，将来还是这方针。即以资产阶级社会学为例，共产党一向认为它是为资本主义制度辩护，为资产阶级统治服务的反动学说，是和马克思主义不相容的东西。但是为着贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，对于那些过去学社会学的人，虽然明知他们学术思想上仍有严重的资产阶级错误观点，在没有发现他们有反革命活动之前，我们不仅给他们以适合于他们的工作岗位，而且还鼓励他们积极参加学术争鸣，实行自我改造。许多报纸刊物都发表过他们的文章，许多单位还邀请过他们座谈。甚至于还积极帮助他们创造条件，希望他们能够进行一些对于社会有益的研究。
    但是资产阶级右派分子却另有企图。原来他们企图利用人民对他们的信任，企图利用学术研究的幌子，在幌子后面贩运资产阶级社会学复辟的私货。今天，他们政治阴谋被揭露了，这些政治野心家成了斗争的对象。这能怪谁呢？难道是“百家争鸣”方针的罪过？
    也许有人会问：是不是从此以后我们就改变了对待社会学的态度了呢？是不是就不再容许研究社会学了呢？不是的。作为学术问题，我们对社会学还是采取“百家争鸣”的政策。即使有人在现在或者将来为资产阶级社会学辩护，只要他政治上不是反革命分子，我们也还是允许他有争辩的自由。因为那是属于学术思想范围内的事情，是人民内部的事情。
