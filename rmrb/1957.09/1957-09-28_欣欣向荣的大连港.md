Today's Dalian Seaport has become one of the most important seaports for transportation in our country. Alongside the jagged docks, masts stand like forests, and cargo piles up like mountains. Often, ten to twenty Chinese and foreign merchant ships are simultaneously docked to load and unload goods. Ten-thousand-ton giant freighters also come and go, making it very busy.

Autumn, which used to be the port's off-season, has now become a busy season.

Since liberation, Dalian Port has received merchant ships from 29 countries, including the Soviet Union, Britain, and Japan. Soviet, Japanese, and British merchant ships travel back and forth particularly frequently. In recent years, Dalian Seaport has also opened several new direct routes to major domestic ports. Every day, ships full of passengers and cargo travel between Dalian and Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places.

Dalian Seaport is the water gateway to Northeast China. The volume of cargo handled by this port is increasing year by year, and this year it will be more than double that of 1952. The cumulative cargo throughput during the First Five-Year Plan was successfully completed in July this year.

Before the First Five-Year Plan, the degree of mechanized loading and unloading at Dalian Seaport was only 44%. Now it has reached 63%, making it one of the ports with the highest degree of mechanized loading and unloading in our country. Along with the increase in loading and unloading volume, the number of automatic loading and unloading vehicles has increased three or four times compared to 1952. The amount of mechanized operations has grown even faster. During the forty years that Japanese imperialists ruled Dalian Seaport, all mechanical operations and important port management work were done by Japanese. Now, all port work is managed by batches of technical and management personnel from our country who have grown up and taken over. Technical and management cadres promoted from workers now account for about 70% of the total number of cadres in the port, and they are doing an excellent job. The number of automatic loading and unloading vehicle drivers has also increased from over forty in the past to more than two hundred and sixty now.

Dalian Seaport was first built by Tsarist Russia in 1899, and then operated by the Japanese for forty years as a tool to plunder resources from Northeast China. In the twelve years since liberation, the face of the people's seaport has been changing with each passing day, flourishing and prosperous.

    欣欣向荣的大连港
    新华社记者　顾铁风
    今日的大连海港，已经成为我国海上运输的重要港口之一。在锯齿形的码头旁，船桅似林，货堆如山，经常有一、二十艘中国的和外国的商船同时靠岸装卸货物。万吨级巨型货轮也进进出出，十分繁忙。
    秋天，过去一向是港口的淡季，现在却变成繁忙的季节。
    解放以来，大连港已经先后接待过苏联、英国、日本、波兰等二十九个国家的商船。苏联、日本、英国的商船往返特别繁忙。大连海港近几年来还开辟了几条直通国内主要港口的新航线。每天，满载旅客和货物的轮船，在大连和上海、天津、青岛等地之间往返航驶。
    大连海港是我国东北的水上门户，这个港口吞吐的货物年年都在增长，今年就将比1952年增长两倍还多。第一个五年计划期间的吞吐量累计数，已经在今年7月间胜利完成。
    大连海港的机械化装卸程度，在第一个五年计划以前还只有44％，现在已经达到63％，是目前我国机械化装卸程度最高的港口之一。随着装卸量的增长，目前自动装卸车的辆数已经比1952年增加三、四倍。机械化操作量增长更快。在日本帝国主义者统治大连海港四十年间，所有机械操作、港口管理的重要工作都由日本人担任。现在，全港工作已经由一批批成长起来的我国技术人材和管理人材自己掌握。从工人中提拔出来的技术干部和管理干部，目前已经占全港干部总数70％左右，并且工作得很出色，现在，自动装卸车的司机也由以往四十多人增加到二百六十多人。
    大连海港是在1899年首先由沙皇俄国建造的，后来日本人又经营了四十年，作为掠夺我国东北资源的工具。解放十二年来，人民海港的面貌日新月异，欣欣向荣。
