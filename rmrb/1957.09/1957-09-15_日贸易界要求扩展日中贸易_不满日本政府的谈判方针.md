Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 14th: People in Japanese trade circles and other areas welcome the Japanese trade delegation to China, which is scheduled to depart late tonight to negotiate the conclusion of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement. At the same time, they express doubts and dissatisfaction with the negotiation policy proposed by the Japanese government.

Suzuki Kazuo, executive director of the Japan-China Trade Association, said that in order to expand Japan-China trade, it is a basic requirement of the Japanese industry and trade circles for the national banks of both sides to conclude a payment agreement and realize the mutual establishment of trade representative offices. Suzuki expressed dissatisfaction with the name and authority of the trade representative organization stipulated by the Japanese government.

Kumaichi Yamamoto, chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, pointed out that the most concerning and important issue for us at present is how the Japanese government will guarantee the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement, which is about to be negotiated and concluded.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 13th: The Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade held a meeting of its standing directors today. All attendees listened to the report by Masanosuke Ikeda and Seiichi Katsumata on the Japanese government's basic policy for negotiating the conclusion of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement, and then approved the report.

Ikeda and Katsumata reported that the Japanese government will recognize the exchange of representatives under the principle of mutual exchange of trade representative organizations, but still hopes that the name will be called "China Trade Corporation Office"; grant the Chinese trade representative organization de facto "consular treatment," and give the trade representatives the treatment of "quasi-public officials"; the Japanese government will guarantee the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement; and recognize China's holding of commodity exhibitions in Nagoya and Fukuoka, Japan.

The Japanese trade delegation to China, composed of representatives from three organizations—the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, and the Japan-China Export-Import Association—will depart for China on September 14th.

　　日贸易界要求扩展日中贸易
　　不满日本政府的谈判方针
    据新华社14日讯  东京消息：日本贸易界等方面人士，欢迎即将在今天深夜动身的日本访华贸易代表团到中国去谈判缔结第四次日中贸易协定。同时，他们对于日本政府所提出的谈判方针表示怀疑和不满。
    日中贸易会专务理事铃木一雄说，为了扩展日中贸易，由双方国家银行缔结支付协定，实现互设通商代表，这是日本产业界和贸易界的基本要求。铃木对日本政府所规定的通商代表机构的名称和权限表示不满。
    日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一指出，日本政府对于即将谈判缔结的第四次日中贸易协定，究竟以何种方式给予保证，这是目前我们最关心的问题，同时也是最重要的问题之一。
    新华社13日讯  东京消息：日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟今天举行了常任理事会会谈。全体与会者在会上听取了由池田正之辅和胜间田清一所作的日本政府对于缔结第四次日中贸易协定谈判的基本方针的报告之后，承认了这个报告。
    池田和胜间田的报告说，日本政府将在互相交换通商代表机构的原则下承认互换代表，但是，名称仍然希望叫做“中国贸易公司事务所”；对中国通商代表机构给予事实上的“领事馆待遇”，并且对于通商代表给予“准公务人员”的待遇；日本政府将对第四次日中贸易协定给予保证；承认中国在日本名古屋和福冈举行商品展览会。
    由日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本国际贸易促进协会和日中输出入协会三个团体的代表组成的日本访华贸易代表团将在9月14日启程前往中国。
