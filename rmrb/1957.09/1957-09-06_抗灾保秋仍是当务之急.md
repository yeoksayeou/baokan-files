    Resisting Disasters and Protecting the Autumn Harvest is Still a Top Priority
    Currently, the threat of natural disasters to a bountiful agricultural harvest has not been eliminated. The flood situation in the Northeast is in a state of emergency; although the North China region has received welcome rain, the autumn drought in parts of Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi is still very serious; and some areas have also experienced pest infestations. Resisting disasters and protecting the autumn harvest remains a top priority.
    As everyone knows, under the current conditions, whether agricultural production can achieve a bumper harvest depends largely on whether there are natural disasters, the magnitude of the disasters, and whether our struggle against the disasters is victorious. In the first half of this year, the country generally enjoyed favorable weather, and most areas achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops. Only localized areas suffered from flooding in the autumn. If we overcome the current floods, droughts, and insect pests, there is a great hope for a full-year bumper harvest. Therefore, urgently mobilizing to resist disasters and protect the autumn harvest has become the key to striving for a large agricultural harvest this year.
    Currently, the responsible party and government personnel in areas severely threatened by natural disasters have mostly led a large number of cadres down to lead the masses in resisting disasters, and the broad masses are also actively fighting against floods, droughts, and insect pests. However, cadres and masses in some areas still lack sufficient understanding of the threat of natural disasters, and they blindly believe that a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion and that it is time to withdraw. Therefore, some have relaxed their vigilance against floods, while others are slow to take action against drought and insect pests. In fact, the flood season of China's major rivers will continue until September and October, and a major disaster may still occur with the slightest negligence; many major autumn and late autumn crops are either being filled and matured or have just been planted and need a large amount of water to produce large and full grains and grow normally; if insect pests are not eliminated as soon as possible, they will turn a bumper harvest into a poor harvest. We must not take chances, but should raise vigilance, make full preparations, and protect the imminent harvest.
    All areas where the flood season has not yet passed need to seize the time to rectify flood prevention teams, inspect and repair dikes, and replenish flood prevention materials to prepare to overcome any possible flood peaks. Areas with urgent flood situations need to prepare to rescue people's lives and property while preventing floods and rushing to deal with emergencies. Heilongjiang Province requires the organization of two teams in dangerous dike sections, one responsible for flood prevention and emergency rescue, and the other responsible for relocation and resettlement, which is very necessary. This can avoid unnecessary losses if the river embankment fails and causes panic. We must educate agricultural cooperative members to cherish public property. Some agricultural cooperatives that are often affected by floods should formulate methods for rescuing public property.
    Areas severely affected by drought should vigorously fight the drought. Areas with water conservancy facilities should irrigate in shifts day and night according to the growth of crops and the urgency of water demand in a planned manner; areas without water conservancy facilities should take various effective measures to actively find water sources, build small-scale water conservancy projects that can play a role in the current drought resistance in advance, and rescue severely drought-stricken seedlings; all areas should seize the time to cultivate the land to preserve soil moisture and reduce water evaporation. In particular, areas that have been relieved of drought should actively mobilize the masses to rush to plant. If the season for rushing to plant grain crops is late, rush to plant vegetables such as turnips and radishes. Planting vegetables can greatly help disaster victims survive the famine. In 1949, the disaster area in northern Jiangsu planted three million mu of vegetables and harvested 7 billion jin of vegetables. In 1956, the disaster area in Henan harvested more than 8 billion jin of autumn vegetables, which enabled many disaster victims to survive the famine. The masses call vegetables "treasures for surviving the famine," which should not be underestimated everywhere; as long as it does not affect wheat planting, more should be planted.
    Areas where insect pests occur should mobilize the masses to catch and kill them, combined with chemical control, and quickly eliminate them.
    The masses should understand that we were able to overcome many natural disasters before cooperativization, and today we are even more capable of overcoming the current disasters. Taking the drought as an example: Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Maoming County, Guangdong Province, encountered a severe drought at the beginning of its establishment in 1956. When it was time to transplant rice seedlings in the spring, the reservoirs and ponds were dry. They diverted water from Yougan Lake, which was five li away from the fields and across five mountain ridges, to the fields to transplant the rice seedlings; the rice seedlings that were heading and flowering in the summer were withered by the drought, and they dried up the water in Yougan Lake, and then built bridges and canals to divert the Jianjiang River water, which was ten li away from the fields, to the fields. Because the agricultural cooperative had a strong force, it finally overcame the drought; under the drought that had not been seen in more than 60 years, the cooperative's grain production increased by 18% for the whole year. There are many agricultural cooperatives all over the country that have increased production due to good disaster resistance work. Fully utilizing the strength of the agricultural cooperative organization will surely overcome disasters and strive for a bumper harvest.

### 抗灾保秋仍是当务之急

专栏：当前农业生产上应注意的事情

    抗灾保秋仍是当务之急
    目前，自然灾害对于农业丰收的威胁尚未解除。东北地区的水情正处在紧急状态；华北地区虽获喜雨，但河南和山西、陕西的部分地区秋旱仍很严重；还有一部分地区发生了虫害。抗灾保秋仍是当务之急。
    大家都知道，在现有的条件下，农业生产能不能丰收，很大程度上决定于有无自然灾害、灾害发生的大小和我们对灾害的斗争是否取得胜利。今年上半年，全国基本上风调雨顺，大部分地区夏季作物获得了丰收，秋季也只是局部地区遭受了水灾。如果我们战胜了当前的洪水、干旱和虫害，全年丰收就大有希望。因此，紧急动员起来抗灾保秋，就成为争取今年农业大丰收的关键。
    现在，遭受自然灾害严重威胁地区的党政负责人员，多已率领大批干部下去领导群众抗灾，广大群众也正在积极地对水、旱、虫害进行斗争。但是，仍有一些地区的干部和群众对自然灾害的威胁认识不足，他们盲目地认为丰收已成定局，大可以收兵了。因此，有的放松了对洪水的戒备，有的抗旱、捕虫行动迟缓。其实，我国各主要河流的汛期要延续到9、10月份，稍一疏忽，仍有可能酿成巨灾；许多大秋和晚秋作物，正在灌浆育实或者是种下不久，需要大量水分才能籽大粒满、生长正常；虫害不及早捕灭，也会使丰收的庄稼变成歉收。不可心存侥幸，而应该提高警惕，充分准备，保卫住即将到手的丰收。
    凡是汛期尚未过去的地区，都需要抓紧整顿防汛队伍、检查并整修堤防、充实防汛器材，准备战胜任何可能到来的洪峰。当前水情紧急的地区，更需要在防汛抢险的同时作好抢救人民生命财产的准备。黑龙江省要求在险要堤段组织两套人马，一套负责防汛抢险，一套负责转移安置，这是很必要的。这样可以避免万一河堤出险，手忙脚乱，造成不应有的损失。要教育农业社社员爱护公有财物。有些常受水灾的农业社，应该制订抢救公有财物的办法。
    受旱严重地区要大力抗旱。有水利设备的地区，要根据农作物生长情况和需水缓急，有计划地日夜轮浇；没有水利设备的地区，要采取各种有效办法，积极寻找水源，提前修建对当前抗旱能起作用的小型水利工程，抢救受旱严重的禾苗；一切地区都要抓紧时间锄地保墒，减少水分蒸发。特别是解除了旱象的地区，更应该积极发动群众抢种。如果抢种粮食作物季节已晚，就要抢种蔓青、萝卜等蔬菜。种菜对帮助灾民度荒能起很大作用。1949年苏北灾区种菜三百万亩，收菜七十亿斤，1956年河南灾区收获秋菜八十多亿斤，使许多灾民赖以度过了灾荒。群众把菜称为“度荒之宝”，各地不可轻视；只要不影响种麦，就应该多种。
    发生虫害的地区要发动群众捕打，结合药物防治，迅速扑灭。
    要使群众了解：在合作化以前，我们能够战胜多次自然灾害，今天就更有条件战胜目前的灾害。以旱灾为例：广东省茂名县前途社1956年建社之初，就碰到了严重的干旱。春天需要插秧的时候，山塘、水库都干涸了，他们就在离田五里路远，翻越五个山岭，把油柑湖的水引到田里来插秧；夏天抽穗扬花的禾苗受旱枯萎，他们车干了油柑湖的湖水，又架桥开渠，把离田十里路远的鉴江水引到田里来。由于农业社有强大的力量，终于战胜了旱灾；在六十多年没有见过的干旱下面，该社全年粮食增产了18％。因抗灾工作做得好而增产的农业社，全国各地还有很多。充分运用农业社组织起来的力量，一定能够战胜灾害，争取丰收。
