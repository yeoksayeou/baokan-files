    The aged only know the price of coal and rice, but the childhood joys can be gloriously retold;
    I pity you for meticulously recording your fishing, but how does it compare to the old master's shrimp fishing?
    "When I was young, I used cotton as bait to fish for large shrimp. The shrimp's claws would grip the bait, and when the fishing line was pulled up, the shrimp would come out of the water with the line, still clinging to the cotton. They only cared about eating, forgetting that they were reaching the other shore. Recorded again by Baishi in Xinwei [1931]." This is one of the handwritten gifts that Teacher Qi gave me on the eve of the "September 18th" Incident in 1931 (see attached picture). On a fan, he painted a large shrimp baring its fangs and claws, clutching a cotton ball on the fishing line. The thin, sturdy bamboo pole was entwined with a fishing line like a spider web, which was very lively and unique. I have never seen a second painting like it. I originally kept several of Teacher Qi's handwritten works, but during the reactionary rule, I exchanged them all for firewood and rice. Only this unforgettable masterpiece remains to commemorate Teacher Qi's passing. My heart is very heavy.
    I became Teacher Qi's student in 1928. At that time, I couldn't paint yet. During the day, I taught, and in the evenings, I wrote things like "Records of Fishing in the Capital" and other anecdotes about Beijing, submitting them to various newspapers for稿费 to make a living. Teacher Qi took pity on my poverty and wholeheartedly taught me how to carve seals and how to render snow scenes on raw Xuan paper. He not only didn't ask for any compensation, but also gave me many seal albums and seal inks. He not only didn't object to me not learning his seal carving style, but also encouraged me to create my own style based on tradition. Under the oppression of life in the old society, I didn't study diligently enough, and I failed to live up to the expectations of my teacher. However, I learned a lot about Teacher Qi's spirit of artistic creation from that time on.
    Whenever I went to Teacher Qi's home, I felt that Teacher Qi did everything himself and lived a very simple life. In winter, there was always a half-sack of so-called "half-empty" peanuts in a corner of the room. He would teach me while peeling and eating peanuts. From the teacher's conversations, I learned that he had put a lot of painstaking effort into studying classical poetry, seal albums of various schools, calligraphy, and famous paintings in his early years. He had also made oil-based copies of ancient famous paintings. Oil-based refers to thin paper that has been coated with tung oil, which is transparent but does not absorb ink.
    Originally, I, a mere student, would not dare to praise Teacher Qi's creations. However, from my personal experience, Teacher Qi's artistic creation was forged from his life through countless trials. His understanding of life was not only through observation, analysis, and comparison, not only through bold summarization and concentration. Before creating, he always fully understood which methods and styles in the existing artistic heritage reflected and depicted his subject. Only then would he put forward his own views on life and how his own expression methods could be more suitable than those of the ancients. Therefore, Teacher Qi's poetry, seal carving, and especially his paintings, were created from his hard work and painstaking research. It is no accident that his artistic creations are loved by the vast masses of people.
    When I saw him painting meticulous realistic sketches of Buddhist leaves and insects, he would first draw the main veins of the Buddhist leaves, and then, stroke by stroke, he would depict the network of veins on the leaves, using his thin, firm, and delicate brushwork and smooth, evenly distributed colors. The leaves were depicted as both realistic and lively, full of vitality. It looked like he was sketching with both brush and ink, rather than simply meticulously rendering a "pattern". Teacher Qi also had his own unique methods for painting meticulous insect paintings. For the six legs of insects, he had to show that they had bones, flesh, and joints, and also had to show the origins and traces of the brushstrokes, as well as their pauses, turns, and twists. He told me that the six legs of insects were "the most difficult to master, as they must be both meticulous and expressive".
    Teacher Qi not only reached a state of perfection in meticulous realistic sketching, but his freehand brushwork paintings were also completely created from his meticulous realistic sketches. First of all, his intention was very meticulous and elaborate. The tall pines, large lotuses, and small animals that he painted were completely based on meticulous detail, and were not haphazard scribbles. Therefore, it is easy to understand, easy to understand, easy to love, and makes one never tire of looking at them. Moreover, that kind of vigor and youthful vitality gives the people tremendous spiritual encouragement, whether they are domestic or foreign!
    Teacher Qi was very concerned about the national economy and the people's livelihood. On the eve of the September 18th Incident, prices soared and people were in a state of anxiety. In the previous poem, he wrote "The aged only know the price of coal and rice," expressing the old man's feelings at the time. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, when he painted crabs, he even used the ancient saying "See how long you can act recklessly." As for painting "tumblers" and "Iron Crutch Li", he was even more borrowing from the topic to express his great dissatisfaction with the big shots and gentlemen of the old society with both sarcasm and irony. After the liberation of Beijing in 1949, Teacher Qi first met Chairman Mao. In a letter Teacher Qi wrote to the Northeast Museum in 1954, he said: "In his old age, Baishi has encountered a prosperous age. The love of people at home and abroad for my paintings should be thanks to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party for their advocacy and care." Please see, these few words alone strongly and forcefully shatter the absurd rumors spread by right-wing elements that said "they do not value traditional Chinese painting" and "they do not respect old Chinese painters."
    Therefore, I say that the spirit of Teacher Qi is immortal.

    白石师精神不死
    于非暗
    衰老但知煤米价，儿时乐事可重夸；
    钓鱼怜汝曾编记，何若先生旧钓虾。
    “余小时，尝以棉花为饵钓大虾，虾足钳其饵，钓丝起，虾随钓丝出水，钳犹不解。只顾一食，忘其登彼岸矣。辛未白石又记”。这是齐老师在1931年（辛未）“九一八”事变前夕赐给我的手泽之一（见附图）。在一个扇面上，画了一只张牙舞爪的大虾，钳住了钓丝上的棉花球，瘦劲的细竹竿，缠绕着像游丝那样的钓丝，非常生动别致，像这样的画，我还没见过有第二幅。我原来保存了齐老师手泽若干件，在反动统治时期，我都换了柴米。只有这一件铭心的绝品，用来纪念齐老师的长逝，心情是非常沉痛的。
    我作齐老师的学生，是从1928年起始的。那时，我还不会画画。我白天教学，晚间写北京掌故之类如“都门钓鱼记”等等的东西，投发各报，换取一些稿费维持生活。齐老师怜我之穷，倾心的教我刻图章，教我在生宣纸上渲染雪景的方法。他老人家既不要我报酬，还送我许多印谱印泥。他不但不反对我不去学他刻印风格，而且他还鼓励我在传统的基础上自创自己的风格。我在旧社会生活的压迫下，没有很好的认真学习，有负于师门的期许。但是，齐老师艺术创作的精神，我从那时起却已学会了不少。
    我每到齐老师的家里，觉得齐老师事必躬亲，生活非常朴素。冬天，在屋的一角，总是堆着半麻袋所谓“半空儿”的花生，边教我，边剥花生米吃。从老师的谈话里，知道他早年对旧体诗、各家印谱、法书名画等都下过相当大的刻苦钻研的功夫，并曾对古代名画进行过油素临摹，所谓油素，就是上过桐油的薄纸，透明而不渗墨。
    本来齐老师的创作，在我这游夏之门是不敢赞一词的。但是，就我个人的体会，齐老师的艺术创作，是他从生活中千锤百炼的炮制出来的。他对生活的理解，不仅是通过观察分析与比较，不仅是大胆的概括与集中，他在创作之前，总是先充分的了解遗产中有哪些反映和刻画的手法与风格，之后，他才提出他自己对于生活的看法，和自己的表现手法怎样比古人更加适合。所以，齐老师的诗、篆刻、特别是绘画，是从他辛勤劳动、刻苦钻研创造出来的。他的艺术创作被广大的人民喜爱，并不是偶然的。
    当我看到他画工笔写生贝叶草虫的时候，他画贝叶，先把贝叶的主筋画出，然后一笔一画的把贝叶上的网状脉，用他瘦硬纤细的笔法，淹润匀停的色彩，把贝叶描绘下来，又真实，又生动，活力充沛，看起来是有笔有墨在写生，而不是一味的纤巧工致在描“花样”。齐老师画工笔草虫，也有他独特的手法。他对六足虫的六条腿，既要表现它有骨有肉有关节，又要显示出用笔的来踪去迹、顿挫转折。他对我说草虫的六足，“既要工，又要写，最难把握”。
    齐老师不但工笔写生已到了化境，他的粗笔写意画完全从他工笔写生的基础上创造出来的。首先是他的用意非常工致细密，他所画的长松大荷以及小动物，完全从工致细密出发，不是顺手的胡涂乱抹。因此，就容易使人理解，使人看得懂，使人喜爱，使人百看不厌，而且那一种气魄，那一种富于青春的活力，给予人民精神上莫大的鼓舞，无论是国内是国外的人民！
    齐老师是很关心国计民生的，九一八事变前夕，物价飞涨，人心惶惶，他在前面那首诗里就写出“衰老但知煤米价”当时老人的心情。在日伪期他画螃蟹，竟用古人的成句写上“看汝横行到几时”。至于画“不倒翁”画“铁拐李”更是借题发挥，连讥带讽的对旧社会的大人先生们表示非常的不满。1949年北京解放，齐老师首先见到了毛主席。1954年齐老师写给东北博物馆的信中说：“白石老年，身逢盛世，国内外人士对余画之喜爱，应感谢毛主席与中国共产党对此之倡导与关怀”。请看，仅仅这几句话，就坚强有力的粉碎了右派分子说什么“不重视国画”，说什么“不尊重老国画家”这些无稽的谰言。
    因此，我说齐老师的精神不死。
