Xinhua News Agency report: Chiang Kai-shek's troops are constantly experiencing suicide cases. Taiwan's "Free China" bi-monthly recently revealed this news:

　　In recent years, cases of suicide among Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers have been frequently heard. The suicides of Chiang's officers and soldiers are not all due to difficult living conditions; mental illness also accounts for a considerable proportion.

　　This publication said: Chiang Kai-shek's group's military expenditure accounts for more than 85% of the budget. However, the monthly salary of a mid-level Chiang Kai-shek officer is only three or four hundred Taiwan dollars, and the monthly salary of a mid-level soldier is only twenty or thirty Taiwan dollars. According to the current wholesale price in Taipei, thirty Taiwan dollars can only buy eighteen *jin* (nine kilograms) of rice.

    生活困难  精神苦闷
    蒋军官兵不断自杀
    据新华社讯　蒋介石军队中不断发生自杀案件。台湾“自由中国”半月刊最近透露了这个消息：
    近几年来，蒋军官兵自杀的案件，已经时有所闻。自杀的蒋军官兵，并不是都由于生活困难，精神病态的因素，也占相当成分。
    这家刊物说：蒋介石集团军费占预算的85％以上。但一个蒋军中级军官的月薪不过三四百元台币，一个中级士兵的月饷不过二三十元台币。依目前台北市批发价，台币三十元只能购买十八市斤大米。
