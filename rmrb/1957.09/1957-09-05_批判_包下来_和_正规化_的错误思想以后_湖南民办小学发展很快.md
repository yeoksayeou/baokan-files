    After Criticizing the Erroneous Ideas of "Taking Everything On" and "Regularization",
    Private Primary Schools in Hunan Developed Rapidly
    (Our Newspaper News) Hunan Province's private primary schools have achieved significant results since the autumn of 1954. Currently, 78 counties and cities across the province have established 1,342 private primary schools or private classes, with over 114,000 students.
    Due to the rapid development of private primary schools, the enrollment requirements of farmers' children in some areas have been appropriately met, and over 3,000 teacher positions have been saved for the state. In Shaodong County, there were only 21 private primary schools with over 1,000 students in 1956, but now there are 56 (classes) with over 2,300 students. The vast majority of private primary schools in counties and cities can be consolidated. In Cili County, 120 (classes) of private primary schools were developed in 1955. Except for three schools that were adjusted and merged due to uneven distribution, the remaining 117 have been consolidated. Last year, the private primary schools developed in Xinning County had 4,800 students. Thirty-two of the county's thirty-four townships and towns have universally established private schools. In particular, in Tangweitou Township and Mushan Township, students in private schools account for more than 40% of the total number of students in the township.
    In April of this year, the Seventh Hunan Provincial Education Administrative Conference focused on studying and discussing the implementation of the central government's policy of relying on the masses to collectively run schools; thoroughly criticized the ideas and working methods of "taking everything on," "regularization," and detachment from the masses. Various localities have thoroughly implemented this policy, and the enthusiasm of the masses for running schools is very high. In order to solve the school building problem at Jinping Private Primary School in Xinning County, more than 80 nearby commune members donated labor and materials, and with the active support of the agricultural cooperative, the houses were quickly built. Many counties have formulated relatively practical plans from top to bottom or from bottom to top. Xinning County plans to develop another 1,300 students in the second half of this year on the basis of the existing number of students in private schools, and generally about 70% of school-age children in the townships will be enrolled. Xiangyin County plans to develop 7,800 students, an increase of 10% in the number of students compared to last year. Hengnan County is also preparing to develop 4,200 students. Some counties not only have plans, but also have created various school-running experiences and financial management methods according to local conditions and school conditions.

    批判“包下来”和“正规化”的错误思想以后
    湖南民办小学发展很快
    本报讯　湖南省民办小学，自1954年秋以来，已获得较大成绩。目前，全省已有七十八个县、市创设了民办小学或民办班一千三百四十二所，拥有学生十一万四千多人。
    由于民办小学迅速发展，适当地满足了部分地区农民子女的入学要求；为国家节约了三千多个教师编制的开支。邵东县1956年只有二十一所民办小学，一千多学生，现增加到五十六所（班），二千三百多学生。绝大部分县、市的民办小学均能巩固。慈利县1955年发展了一百二十所（班）民办小学，除三所学校因分布不均进行调整和合并外，其余一百一十七所都巩固下来了。新宁县去年发展的民办小学有学生四千八百名，全县三十四个乡、镇有三十二个普遍设立了民办学校，特别是塘尾头乡和木山乡，民办学校的学生已占全乡在校学生总数40％以上。
    今年4月间，湖南省第七届教育行政会议上，曾着重研究和讨论了贯彻中央依靠群众集体办学的方针；深入批判了“包下来”、“正规化”和脱离群众的思想与工作方法。各地深入贯彻这个方针，群众办学积极性很高。新宁县金坪民办小学为了解决校舍问题，附近八十多户社员，有的捐工、有的献料，加上农业社积极支持，很快就把房子盖好了。不少县都自上而下或自下而上地作出了比较切合实际的规划。新宁县计划在现有民办学校学生数字的基础上，今年下半年再发展一千三百人，一般乡将有70％左右的学龄儿童入学。湘阴县计划发展七千八百人，在校学生比去年增加10％。衡南县也准备发展四千二百人。有些县不仅有了规划，还因地制宜、因校制宜地创造了多种多样的办学经验和经费管理办法。
