Chen Weitai is Extremely Reactionary: Openly Clamoring for the Dissolution of Agricultural Cooperatives and Return of Land to Landlords

(Our Newspaper's Dispatch) Chen Weitai, a clerk in the Secretariat of the Changchun Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is an extremely reactionary spokesman for the landlord and capitalist classes. He openly advocated returning the peasants' land to the landlords, dissolving agricultural cooperatives, and turning over small and medium-sized enterprises to private management. After the nationwide anti-rightist struggle was launched, he continued to brazenly post reactionary big-character posters, attacking the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party as a "shockingly dictatorial government," surpassing even Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Yang of Sui, and Jie and Zhou.

Chen Weitai's hatred for the Communist Party and hostility towards socialism have historical roots. His grandfather was a large landlord, and his father was a liquor and tobacco merchant. During the puppet Manchukuo period, he worked as a clerk in the puppet county government. After Japan surrendered, he also participated in the "County Maintenance Association" organized by local bullies, gentry, enemy collaborators, and puppet personnel. In September 1945, when our army liberated Dalaite Banner, Chen Weitai infiltrated our county government. In 1946, when our county government was attacked by bandits and forced to relocate, Chen Weitai left the revolutionary ranks and joined the reactionary armed organization "Public Security Maintenance Association." Later, he deserted the revolution for the second time, left his job without permission twice to return home, and even worked as the owner of a cart inn. When the entire institute's staff refuted his extremely reactionary words and deeds to shreds, he not only refused to admit his guilt but instead became enraged and even resorted to violence at the debate.

The entire staff of the institute is extremely indignant at the shameless and rampant behavior of this die-hard rightist and is determined to fight him to the end, never retreating until complete victory.

　　陈维太反动绝顶
    公然叫嚣解散农业社把土地归还地主
    本报讯　长春中国科学院光学精密机械仪器研究所秘书科科员陈维太，是个反动透顶的地主阶级和资产阶级的代言人。他公然主张把农民的土地还给地主并解散农业合作社，把中小型企业交给私人经营。在全国各地展开反右派斗争以后，他还气焰嚣张地继续张贴反动的大字报，攻击共产党领导下的人民政府是“触目惊心的独裁政府”，为秦始皇、隋炀帝、桀纣所望尘莫及。
    陈维太如此仇恨共产党、敌视社会主义是有其历史根源的。他的祖父是个大地主，他的父亲是烟酒商。在伪满时期，他当过伪县公署的职员。日本投降后，他又参加了土豪劣绅敌伪人员组织的“县维持会”。1945年9月我军解放大赉县，陈维太混入我县政府工作。1946年我县政府遭土匪袭击被迫转移，陈维太便离开革命队伍，投入反动武装组织的“治安维持会”。后来，他又第二次脱离革命，两次私自离职回家，并且一度当过大车店的老板。当全所职工把他的极端反动的言行驳斥得体无完肤的时候，他不但不低头认罪，反而恼羞成怒，竟在辩论会上动手打人。
    研究所全所职工对这个死硬的右派分子无耻的猖狂行为，都万分愤恨，坚决要同他斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
