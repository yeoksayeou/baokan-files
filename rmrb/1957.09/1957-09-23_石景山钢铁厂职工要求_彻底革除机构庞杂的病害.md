Xinhua News Agency dispatch from September 22nd: Some workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have recently posted big-character posters exposing the plant's bloated and cumbersome management structure, demanding a thorough reform in accordance with the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily.

At the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, for every 100 production workers, there are an average of 49 non-production personnel, of which about 30 are staff, technical, security, and service personnel who serve production. The rest are personnel who serve the lives of the workers.

According to the revelations of some workers, the bloated structure is mainly reflected in too many command systems and assistant departments. The factory is led by the factory director and five deputy directors who are responsible for production, personnel, operations, general affairs, and basic construction, forming six organizational systems. There are more than 20 departments assisting the director and deputy directors—more than 700 people in total. The plant has more than 1,100 welfare workers. The plant's cultural, educational and welfare undertakings are very complex, including dormitories, canteens, hospitals, schools, nurseries, bathhouses, theaters, garden nurseries, dairy farms, soy milk shops, soda factories, all the way to road repairs, aqueduct repairs, cleaning, and landscaping. Almost every public utility that a general city should have is available in this plant.

According to the big-character posters, some departments are severely overstaffed, and some staff only work four or five hours a day.

Due to the cumbersome structure, there are many checkpoints and procedures for handling affairs. Many tasks, such as preparing plans, repairing machines, and issuing wages, must go through many checkpoints and procedures. The implementation of a technical measure requires approval from several levels, and if the measure needs to be changed, it has to go through several levels again. Even something like issuing wages requires the following ten cumbersome procedures: (1) The workshop timekeeper calculates the number of days the worker attended work, fills in the worker's wage grade, and submits it to the workshop accounting group. If the worker is paid by piece rate, the workshop labor organization group needs to calculate the worker's piece rate quota and submit it to the workshop accounting group; (2) The workshop accounting group calculates the worker's wages; (3) The accounting section reviews and summarizes the wages reported by the accounting groups of each workshop; (4) The wage accounts of each workshop are submitted to the finance section; (5) The finance section withdraws money from the bank; (6) The finance section hands the money over to the workshop accounting group and the accounts to the accounting section; (7) The workshop accounting group hands the money over to the foreman (or team leader), and the foreman (or team leader) stamps it; (8) The foreman (or team leader) distributes the wages to the workers, and the workers stamp it; (9) The foreman (or team leader) then hands the stamped receipts to the workshop accounting group; (10) The workshop accounting group reports the stamped receipts to the finance section for filing.

Because of the over-fine division of labor, too many systems, a cumbersome structure, and complicated procedures, and because these organizational structures and systems lack emphasis on cooperation and unity in work, and excessively emphasize the contradictions, emphasizing layer-by-layer supervision and mutual restraint. Therefore, this cumbersome organizational structure and system have become a breeding ground for departmentalism, bureaucracy, and red tape. There are many phenomena such as procrastination, buck-passing, mutual distrust, and everyone doing their own thing in work. For example, the production, technology, and technical supervision sections all have to count product output and quality every day, which is redundant, and the statistical results are often different. Because there are many things and official documents that are shirked, the Party Secretary, factory director, chief engineer, and workshop cadres have to spend a lot of time troubleshooting and forwarding official documents, which affects more in-depth research on production and ideological work.

Now, the workers have raised their class consciousness in the rectification movement, and they have exposed this phenomenon that hinders the faster development of socialist industry in big-character posters and issued calls for thorough reform. These big-character posters have now attracted the full attention of the factory leadership, and improvement measures are being studied. The following are excerpts from two big-character posters that are representative. (Attached picture)

In the past, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant used manual labor to mix ore, which was very labor-intensive. In the past, some workers had suggested using the plant's existing electric shovels and other mechanical equipment to replace manual labor, but the relevant departments believed that this would affect the quality of the iron, so it was not adopted. During the rectification movement, the leadership carefully considered this issue, and after experiments, it was proved that this would not affect the quality of the iron. It has now been decided to use mechanical equipment. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Huiru.

### 石景山钢铁厂职工要求  彻底革除机构庞杂的病害

    石景山钢铁厂职工要求
    彻底革除机构庞杂的病害
    本报特约新华社22日讯　石景山钢铁厂有些职工最近贴出大字报揭露本厂管理构机臃肿庞杂，他们要求按照勤俭办企业的方针进行彻底改革。
    石景山钢铁厂每平均一百个生产工人就有四十九个非生产人员，其中约有三十人是为生产服务的职员和技术、警卫、勤杂人员，其余的是为职工生活服务的人员。
    根据一些职工的揭发，机构臃肿主要表现在指挥系统和助手部门太多。这个厂由厂长和五个副厂长分别领导生产、人事、经营、总务和基本建设等六个组织系统的工作。协助正副厂长工作的助手部门——科室就有二十多个，共七百多人。全厂的福利工作人员有一千一百多人。这个厂的文教福利事业很庞杂，有宿舍、食堂、医院、学校、托儿所、浴室、剧院、花园苗圃、牛奶场、豆浆房、汽水场、一直到修马路、修水道、清洁和绿化工作等等。一般城市应有的公共事业，这个厂几乎样样俱全。
    据大字报揭发，有些部门人浮于事的现象很严重，有些工作人员每天只有四、五个小时的工作。
    由于机构庞杂，办起事来关口多，手续多。编计划、检修机器、发工资等很多工作，都要经过很多关口和手续。实现一项技术措施就要经过几个关口审批，如果这项措施需要改动一下，又得重过几关。就像发工资这种事，也需要经过下面十次繁琐的手续：（1）由车间记工员计算工人出勤日数，填写工人工资等级交给车间核算组。如果是计件工人，还需要由车间劳动组织组计算工人计件定额交给车间核算组；（2）车间核算组计算工人工资；（3）会计科审查和综合各车间核算组报来的工人工资；（4）把各车间工资账交给财务科；（5）财务科到银行领款；（6）财务科把款交给车间核算组，把账交给会计科；（7）车间核算组把钱交给工长（或组长），工长（或组长）盖章；（8）工长（或组长）把工资发给工人，工人盖章；（9）工长（或组长）再把有工人图章的单据交给车间核算组；（10）车间核算组把有工人图章的单据上报财务科，入档。
    由于分工过细，系统过多，机构庞杂，制度繁琐，而且这些组织机构和制度又缺乏强调工作中协作和统一的一面，过分强调了矛盾的一面，强调层层监督，相互制约。因此，这种庞杂的组织机构和制度就成了本位主义、文牍主义和官僚主义的温床。工作中拖拉、扯皮、互不信任、各搞一套等现象很多。例如生产、技术和技术监督三个科，每天都要统计产品产量和质量等情况，彼此工作重复，统计结果又往往不一样。由于扯皮的事情和公文很多，党委书记、厂长、总工程师和车间的干部，就不得不用很多时间排难解纷，转批公文，影响更深入的研究生产和思想工作。
    现在，职工们在整风运动中提高了阶级觉悟，他们在大字报上揭发了这种阻碍社会主义工业更快发展的现象，并且发出了彻底改革的呼喊。这些大字报现在已经引起了工厂领导上的充分注意，并正在研究改进措施。下面抄录的是有一定代表性的两张大字报。（附图片）
    石景山钢铁厂过去混匀矿石要用人工，劳动强度很大，从前有的工人曾建议用厂内现有的电铲等机械设备代替人工，但有关部门认为这样作会影响铁的质量，因而未被采纳。整风运动中，领导上慎重地考虑了这个问题，经过试验，证明这样作不会影响铁的质量，现在已并决定采用机械设备。新华社记者　喻惠如摄
