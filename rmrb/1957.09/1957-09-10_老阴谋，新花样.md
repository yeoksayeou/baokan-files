Old Conspiracy, New Tricks
By Our Staff Commentator

Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique dispatched a so-called "Republic of China National Opera Troupe" to the United Kingdom, which will perform in London in mid-September under the name of "Chinese Classical Theater." This "troupe" is actually the Peking Opera troupe "Dapeng Opera Society" affiliated with the Chiang gang's air force. This performance was arranged by Chen Yaosheng, who once served as a counselor in the puppet government's embassy in the UK and has been engaged in activities against New China in London. According to a report from the Chiang gang's Central News Agency, the Chiang gang attaches great importance to the troupe's performance in the UK. Before their departure, they were personally instructed by Yu Hongjun, the "President of the Executive Yuan" of the Chiang gang, to strengthen their activities against New China overseas.

Chen Yaosheng's arrangements have been supported by some people in the British ruling group who harbor hostility towards New China. Certain individuals in the British ruling group, while supporting the Chiang gang's official Peking Opera troupe's performance in the UK, are also afraid that the British people will understand the truth. That's why they have adopted such a secretive and shameless despicable method, disguising this air force troupe and sending it to the UK to carry out activities against New China. Not only that, but in order to confuse the public, steal and destroy the huge reputation earned by our country's classical art troupe in Europe and the UK two years ago, some British newspapers have even resorted to deliberately slandering our "Chinese Classical Art Troupe" and touting the Chiang gang's "troupe," making all kinds of distorted propaganda. For example, on August 12, the British "Times" published a news item describing this fake troupe as the orthodox Peking Opera, while portraying the Chinese Classical Art Troupe, which won great acclaim in London two years ago, as a branch of Peking Opera. This is naturally a shameful slander against the Chinese art troupe and our Peking Opera. However, the "Times"'s distorted propaganda cannot deceive the British public. It can only expose their ignorance of Chinese culture and their deliberate attempt to damage the normal development of cultural and friendly relations between the Chinese and British people.

Some people in the British ruling group who harbor hostility towards China do not care about Chinese culture and art at all. They are single-mindedly trying to support the Chiang Kai-shek clique. They fantasize that one day the Chiang Kai-shek clique will be able to restore itself on the Chinese mainland. Following the United States, they have been in open and secret collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, giving them open or secret support and encouragement, attempting to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, in order to create a so-called "two Chinas" situation. Their arrangement for the Chiang Kai-shek clique's air force troupe to perform in the UK is aimed at expanding the propaganda for "two Chinas" among the British people and hindering cultural exchanges and friendly relations between the people of China and Britain.

Since the beginning of this year, the collusive activities between these figures in the British ruling group and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique have become more blatant and frequent. Various signs indicate that Britain is stepping up its conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Some people in the British ruling group openly advocate that Britain should pay more attention to Taiwan, maintain "friendship" with Taiwan, and develop so-called "transactional contacts" with Taiwan in order to encourage the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In March of this year, Tilling, a Conservative member of the British Parliament, visited Taiwan, the first visit to Taiwan by a British parliamentarian since Britain recognized China, and he spared no effort to boast and encourage the Chiang Kai-shek clique, even openly clamoring that "once a war breaks out, Britain will fight alongside Taiwan." Immediately after Tilling, a "British Friendly Visiting Group" visited Taiwan. This visiting group included a group of reactionary politicians, retired soldiers, professors, lawyers, and journalists, led by Sir Auden, a retired diplomat who had served as a consul-general in China for a long time. They arrogantly advocated "friendship" between Britain and Taiwan, openly vilified the People's Republic of China, clamored that Britain's recognition of China was a "serious mistake," and openly encouraged the Chiang Kai-shek clique to persevere and wait for an opportunity to counterattack the mainland. At the same time as this delegation visited Taiwan, even the British Board of Trade sent two mid-level officials to Taiwan to visit and investigate, supposedly to expand trade between Britain and Taiwan. Then, in May of this year, British Labour Party MP Freedah also visited Taiwan. During this period, the Chiang Kai-shek clique also sent "legislators" Hu Qiuyuan, Hu Jianzhong, and "former Minister of Education" Cheng Tianfang to the UK to carry out conspiratorial activities. In August of this year, the Chiang Kai-shek clique also sent a so-called "Chinese Boy Scout" to London to carry out activities. It is not difficult to see that this series of activities, arrogant and blatant clamoring, and the Chiang gang's air force troupe's visit to the UK are by no means accidental. All of this is inseparable from Britain's deliberate conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

In order to follow and cooperate with the United States in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Britain is increasingly intensifying its collusion with Taiwan and actively advocating and promoting the conspiracy of "two Chinas." Britain's approach is an approach of enmity towards China, and it cannot but arouse the anger of the Chinese people.

The Chinese people have more than once issued stern warnings against Britain's activities to create "two Chinas." We are willing to once again solemnly warn those gentlemen in Britain who are creating "two Chinas": Taiwan must be liberated, and the conspiracy of "two Chinas" must fail. If Britain does not abandon this conspiracy, it will ultimately be Britain that suffers.

    老阴谋，新花样
    本报评论员
    最近，蒋介石集团派遣了一个所谓“中华民国国剧团”前往英国，将于9月中旬用“中国古典剧院”的名义在伦敦演出。这个“剧团”实际上就是蒋帮空军属下的京剧班子“大鹏剧社”。这次演出是通过曾任伪政府驻英大使馆参赞而一直在伦敦进行反对新中国活动的陈尧圣安排的。据蒋帮中央社消息，蒋帮对这个剧团的赴英演出甚为重视，他们临行前曾经由蒋帮“行政院长”俞鸿钧亲自训话，指示他们要在海外加强反对新中国的活动。
    陈尧圣的安排是得到了英国统治集团中一些对新中国怀抱敌意的人的支持的。英国统治集团中某些人士一方面支持蒋帮官方京剧团去英演出，一方面又害怕英国人民了解事实真象，才采取现在这种诡秘无耻的卑劣手法，把这个空军剧团加以乔装弄到英国去进行反对新中国的活动。不但如此，为了混淆视听，盗窃和破坏我国古典艺术剧团两年前在欧洲和英国演出所博得的巨大声誉，某些英国报纸竟然不惜故意诬蔑我“中国古典艺术剧团”，抬高蒋帮“剧团”，作种种歪曲宣传。例如8月12日英国“泰晤士报”就出现过一则消息，把这个冒牌的剧团说成是京剧的正宗，反而把两年前在伦敦满载盛誉的中国古典艺术剧团说成是京剧的一个流派。这自然是对中国艺术团和我国京剧的可耻的诽谤。但是，“泰晤士报”这种歪曲宣传是欺骗不了英国公众的。它只能暴露他们对中国文化的无知和蓄意损害中英人民之间文化友好关系的正常发展。
    英国统治集团中一些对中国怀抱敌意的人对中国的文化艺术是谈不上任何关心的。他们一心想扶植蒋介石集团。他们幻想有朝一日蒋介石集团得以在中国大陆上复辟。他们追随美国之后，同蒋介石集团明来暗往，勾勾搭搭，公开或暗地给予支持和鼓励，企图阻止中国人民解放台湾，以期制造所谓“两个中国”的局面。他们安排蒋介石集团空军剧团到英国演出，目的便是要在英国人民中间扩大制造“两个中国”的宣传，阻挠中英两国人民间的文化往来和友好关系。
    从今年初以来，英国统治集团中这些人士同台湾蒋介石集团勾勾搭搭的往来活动是更加露骨而频繁了。种种迹象说明英国正在加紧推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。英国统治集团中一些人公开鼓吹英国要更加重视台湾，要同台湾保持“友好”，要发展同台湾所谓“事务性联系”，以鼓励蒋介石集团。今年3月，英国保守党议员蒂林到台湾作英国承认中国以后第一次英国议员对台湾的访问，为蒋介石集团百般吹嘘打气，甚至还公开叫嚣说：“一旦发生战争，英国将同台湾一道作战”。紧接着蒂林之后，一个“英国人士友好访问团”访问了台湾。这个访问团包括了一批反动政客、退休军人、教授、律师、记者，由以前曾经长期在中国担任过总领事的退休外交官奥登爵士率领。他们嚣张地鼓吹英国同台湾“友好”，公开诋毁中华人民共和国，叫嚣英国承认中国是“严重的错误”，并且公开鼓励蒋介石集团坚持下去，以等待时机反攻大陆。和这批代表团访台同时，甚至英国贸易部还派了两个中级官员到台湾去访问考察，据说是要扩大英国同台湾的贸易。接着英国工党议员傅利达也于今年5月访问台湾。蒋介石集团在这个期间也派出了“立法委员”胡秋原、胡健中和“前教育部长”程天放等人到英国进行阴谋活动。今年8月间蒋介石集团又派遣了所谓“中国童子军”去伦敦活动。不难看出，这一系列的活动，狂妄露骨的叫嚣，以及此次蒋帮空军剧团访问英国，绝不是偶然的。这一切都是同英国蓄意制造“两个中国”的阴谋分不开的。
    英国为了追随和配合美国阴谋制造“两个中国”，阻挠中国人民解放台湾，日益加紧同台湾的勾搭，积极鼓吹和推行“两个中国”的阴谋活动。英国这种做法是与中国为敌的做法，它不能不引起中国人民的愤怒。
    中国人民已经不止一次地对英国这种制造“两个中国”的活动提出过严正的警告。我们愿意再一次正告英国的那些制造“两个中国”的先生们：台湾一定要解放，“两个中国”的阴谋一定要失败。英国如不放弃它的这一阴谋，到头来吃亏的将是英国自己。
