Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, September 7th: Overcoming a sense of complacency in the production increase and conservation campaign, the workers of Tangshan Steel Plant increased the country's steel ingot production by more than 500 tons in August.

In the first half of this year, Tangshan Steel Plant repeatedly set the national record for the lowest pig iron consumption in converter steelmaking, increasing the country's steel ingot production by more than 11,000 tons, and also reducing production costs by more than 910,000 yuan. However, at the beginning of the second half of the year, a complacent sense of relief emerged, affecting production. Therefore, from the end of July to the beginning of August, the factory, from leaders to workers, universally examined and criticized the complacent and slack mood, re-discussed and revised the production increase and conservation plan, and, focusing on key production issues, organized technicians to summarize the advanced experiences of the workers and mobilized workers to carry out competitions between shifts and groups, quickly reversing the unfavorable production situation. In August, the average pig iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 14 kilograms compared to July, and production costs decreased by more than 40,000 yuan.

    克服松劲情绪　生产立刻上升
    一个月增产五百吨钢
    新华社保定7日电　唐山钢厂职工8月份克服增产节约运动中的松劲情绪，为国家增产了五百多吨钢锭。
    今年上半年，唐山钢厂曾多次创造全国转炉炼钢生铁消耗最低纪录，为国家增产了一万一千多吨钢锭，生产成本也降低了九十一万多元。但是在下半年开始时，曾产生一种松一口气的自满思想，影响了生产。于是，7月底到8月初，这个厂从领导到职工普遍检查和批判了自满松劲情绪，重新讨论和修订了增产节约计划，并针对生产上的关键问题，组织技术人员总结工人中的先进经验，发动工人开展了班与班、组与组的竞赛，很快就扭转了生产不好的局面。8月份平均每吨钢的生铁消耗比7月份降低了十四公斤，生产成本降低四万多元。
