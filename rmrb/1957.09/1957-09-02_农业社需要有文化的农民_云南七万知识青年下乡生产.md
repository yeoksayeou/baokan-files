    Agricultural Cooperatives Need Cultured Farmers
    70,000 Educated Youths Go to the Countryside in Yunnan for Production

    (Our Dispatch) Agricultural cooperatives in Kunming, Dali, Yuxi, Qujing, Mengzi, Zhaotong and other areas of Yunnan Province have recently been supplemented by more than 70,000 educated youths. The youths have stated that they are determined to be the first generation of cultured farmers in New China through agricultural labor.

    Yunnan Province began arranging employment for middle and primary school graduates who could not continue their education last December. Party committees, governments, the Communist Youth League, schools, and agricultural cooperatives at all levels have attached great importance to this work. In addition to conducting a series of educational programs for students on the glory of labor, they also conducted meticulous ideological mobilization work among the students' parents. The idea of "disparaging physical labor" and "hoping that the government would take care of job assignments" has been basically reversed among general students and parents. Recently, more than 60,000 graduating middle and primary school students from rural areas have voluntarily returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, and agricultural cooperatives and parents in various places have warmly welcomed them. More than 10,000 middle and primary school graduates in the cities who could not continue their studies have also expressed their willingness to settle in agricultural cooperatives, determined to become cultured farmers. Of the approximately 6,000 educated youths in Kunming who could not continue their studies this year, apart from a portion of students studying at home or finding their own jobs and being placed in urban service industries, more than 1,200 people volunteered to settle in suburban agricultural cooperatives and participate in reclamation in Dehong, Xishuangbanna, and other places. The first group of educated youths in Kunming to settle in suburban agricultural cooperatives has happily taken up their production posts. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have taken meticulous care of these educated youths. Agricultural cooperatives in Guandu, Xishan, Panlong, Haikou, Anning, and other districts specially held welcome meetings for educated youths who went to the countryside to participate in production. Panlong Cooperative used small boats to take the youths who settled down from the city to the countryside, and the agricultural cooperatives also arranged the beds, desks, and benches neatly in their respective rooms, even placing the matches for lighting the lamps beside the pillows. The three agricultural cooperatives in Chengguan Town, Kunyang County, jointly held a welcome meeting of more than 1,000 people to welcome the 25 junior high school graduates and 130 senior primary school graduates from the town who returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. Some cooperatives even beat gongs and drums and pulled carts to welcome the graduates who returned to their hometowns to participate in production. Some cooperatives properly arranged work according to the specific circumstances of the students, with some serving as accountants, scorekeepers, and some serving as amateur cultural instructors. The Communist Youth League organizations also helped them become familiar with the production situation. The students who returned to their hometowns to participate in production all felt warm and expressed their determination to work hard to improve themselves and to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the countryside.

    农业社需要有文化的农民
    云南七万知识青年下乡生产
    本报讯  云南省昆明、大理、玉溪、曲靖、蒙自、昭通等地的农业社，最近充实了七万多知识青年。青年们纷纷表示，在农业劳动中，立志要作个新中国第一代有文化的农民。
    云南省对不能继续升学的中、小学毕业生的安排工作，是从去年12月开始进行的。各地党委、政府、共青团、学校及农业社，十分重视这项工作。他们除对学生进行了一系列的有关劳动光荣的教育外，还对学生家长作了细致的思想动员工作。在一般学生及家长中，基本上扭转了“轻视体力劳动”，“希望政府包下来分配工作”的思想。最近，家在农村的六万多名应届中、小学毕业生，已纷纷自动回乡参加农业生产，各地的农业社及家长们热烈地欢迎了他们。城市里的一万多名不能升学的中、小学毕业生，也表示自愿到农业社落户，立志作个有文化的农民。昆明市今年不能升学的知识青年约有六千多人，其中除了一部分学生在家自学或自找职业和被安置在城市服务性行业工作以外，有一千二百多人自愿去郊区农业社落户和去德宏、西双版纳等地参加垦荒。昆明市第一批赴郊区农业社落户的知识青年，已愉快地走上生产岗位。各地农业社对这些知识青年照顾得无微不至。官渡、西山、盘龙、海口、安宁等区的农业社特地为下乡参加生产的知识青年开了欢迎会。盘龙社用小船把下乡落户的青年从城市接到农村去，农业社还在他们各自居住的房间里，把床铺、桌凳都摆得整整齐齐，连点灯用的火柴都放在枕头边。昆阳县城关镇的三个农业社，联合召开了一千多人的欢迎会，欢迎全镇二十五名初中毕业生和一百三十名高小毕业生回乡参加农业生产。有的社还敲锣打鼓拉着马车欢迎回乡参加生产的毕业生。有的社根据学生们的具体情况，妥善地安置了工作，有的担任会计、记分员，有的担任业余文化教员。共青团组织也帮助他们熟悉生产情况。回乡生产的学生无不感到温暖，表示要努力锻炼自己，要在农村生根、开花、结果。
