    Beijing Fresh Fruits Celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival
    State-owned farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives in the three suburban districts of Beijing—Haidian, Changping, and the Jingxi Mining Area—are currently stepping up the harvesting of apples, pears, and grapes so that the people of the capital can enjoy the freshest fruits during the Mid-Autumn Festival.
    According to preliminary estimates from relevant sources, Beijing's suburban fruit production may exceed last year's. The apples from the Western Suburb State-owned Farm are expected to yield over 30,000 jin this year; the juicy and delicious "Red Banana" apples weigh half a jin each. The more than 7,000 "Rose Fragrant" grapes and other varieties planted in 1955 by the Xishan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Haidian District are expected to produce 8,000 jin this year. The Xianfeng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Changping District has adopted scientific management for its fruit trees this year, and the estimated yield from over 20,000 pear trees is more than 300,000 jin. ·Dian Yi·
    Urban Services Department
    Arranges Purchase and Sale of Sugar and Milk Powder
    The Urban Services Department recently held a sugar and pastry professional conference to arrange the purchase and sale of sugar and milk powder.
    The conference noted that although sugar production in the next production year is projected to increase by 170,000 tons compared to the previous year, and milk powder production in 1958 is projected to increase by approximately 3 million pounds compared to this year, this will still not meet the growing consumer demand. Therefore, service departments in various regions must strengthen procurement efforts to strive to complete and exceed procurement plans. Service departments in sugar-producing areas should promptly coordinate plans with industrial departments, sign sales contracts, and strengthen the procurement of local sugar, especially from dispersed production areas, to procure more during the upcoming peak sugar production season. For machine-made and semi-machine-made milk powder products that meet quality standards, all should be purchased; handicrafts that meet certain quality requirements and can be used for food industry processing should be fully purchased according to the principle of pricing based on quality.
    In the future, brown sugar should still be given priority for supply to rural areas. Milk powder should primarily be supplied to large cities and industrial and mining areas.

    Shanghai Pig Fat Exchanged for Zhejiang Ham
    Solving the Consumption Needs of Both Parties
    Since the beginning of summer, Zhejiang Province has been short of pig fat, and Shanghai needs ham. Recently, Shanghai and Zhejiang Province exchanged a portion of pig fat and ham, which not only solved their own difficulties but also supported each other's needs.
    This material exchange was conducted with the assistance of the Urban Services Department. ·Zhou Zhen·

    北京鲜果贺中秋
    北京市海淀、昌平、京西矿区等三个郊区的国营农场和农业生产合作社，目前正在加紧收摘苹果、梨和葡萄，以便让首都人民在中秋佳节吃到最新鲜的水果。
    据有关方面的初步估计，今年北京郊区的水果产量可能超过去年。西郊国营农场的苹果，今年可以收三万多斤；饱满多汁、鲜美可口的“红香蕉”，两个就有一斤重。海淀区西山农业生产合作社1955年栽植的七千多棵“玫瑰香”等葡萄，今年可以产八千斤。昌平区先锋农业生产合作社今年对果树采用了科学管理，两万多棵梨树估计能产梨三十多万斤。·甸义·
    城市服务部
    安排食糖、奶粉购销
    城市服务部最近召开糖业糕点专业会议，安排了食糖、奶粉两种商品的购销工作。
    会议认为，虽然食糖下一生产年度预计比上年增产十七万吨，奶粉1958年预计比今年增产约三百万磅，但是还赶不上人民消费量日益增长的需要，因此各地服务部门必须加强收购工作，争取完成和超额完成收购计划。各产糖区的服务部门要迅速同工业部门衔接计划，签订包销合同，加强土糖特别是分散产区土糖的收购，趁即将到来的产糖旺季争取多收购一些。对奶粉的机制和半机制产品，凡符合质量标准的一律实行包销，手工业产品达到一定质量要求，能供食品工业加工用的，根据按质论价原则全部收购。
    今后红糖仍应优先供应农村。奶粉以供应大城市及工矿区为主。
