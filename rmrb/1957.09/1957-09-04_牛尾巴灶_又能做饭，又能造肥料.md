"Cow-Tail Stove"
Both for Cooking and Making Fertilizer
Yu Ming
    To solve the problem of fertilizer shortage, farmers in Anhui Province have come up with many methods. One of them is worth introducing to the whole country, which is using the "cow-tail stove" to smoke and produce fertilizer.
    The "cow-tail stove" is simply an ordinary rural kitchen stove that has been modified. The modification involves removing the original chimney that went straight up to the outside of the roof, and making a hole on the side of the stove that is against the wall, allowing the chimney to pass through the wall. The short section of the chimney outside the wall looks like a cow's tail.
    Director Ding of the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Feidong County took me to see a "cow-tail stove" and the pile of soil fertilizer it had produced. The pile of soil fertilizer was smoked black, like the soil from disassembled stoves and kang platforms. This stove was modified from an original rural kitchen stove. There are two pots on the stove, one close to the wall and one slightly further away. On the other side of the stove are two fire doors, and above each fire door is a short chimney. These two chimneys connect more than a foot above the stove surface and then connect to a single chimney near the wall, passing through the wall. Below the cow-tail chimney outside the wall is an earthen platform, on which a large pile of loose soil blocks is stacked, surrounding the cow-tail chimney. Farmers put fuel into the stove through the fire doors inside the house to burn, and the smoke returns to the fire doors, and is drawn by the chimneys above the fire doors to the outside of the wall, leading to the soil blocks around the cow-tail chimney. The pile of soil is smoked three times a day when cooking three meals. In six or seven days, this pile of soil is smoked into fertilizer.
    This method of making fertilizer has many advantages: First, it is simple and easy to implement. Director Ding and I went to a production team, and he and a mason spent just over an hour modifying a chimney in the home of a team cadre. Second, this fertilizer can be produced in large quantities. Using a cow-tail stove to smoke soil, the soil is changed every six or seven days, and one smoking can produce a thousand catties of soil fertilizer. The Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative has calculated the effectiveness of soil fertilization with the modified cow-tail stove: If 70% of the cooperative members' kitchen stoves are converted into cow-tail stoves, there will be more than 3,000 stoves making fertilizer; if each stove smokes four times a month, each time one thousand catties, the cooperative can obtain more than thirteen million catties of soil fertilizer in one month. Third, it can increase the income of the members. According to the experiment of the Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative in Luan County last year, the effect of applying 5,000 catties of smoked fertilizer per mu is the same as applying 55 catties of cake fertilizer per mu, and the yield of corn is 260 catties. Buying 55 catties of cake fertilizer for application on one mu costs more than three yuan and eight jiao. If the money for buying fertilizer is used to purchase the soil fertilizer smoked by the members, a farmer who can smoke 4,000 catties of soil fertilizer per month can earn three yuan and two jiao (calculated at eight fen per hundred catties).

### “牛尾巴灶”  又能做饭，又能造肥料

    “牛尾巴灶”
    又能做饭，又能造肥料
    于明
    为了解决缺肥问题，安徽省农民想了许多办法。其中有一个办法值得向全国介绍，就是用“牛尾巴灶”熏烟造肥。
    “牛尾巴灶”，就是经过改建的普通农家的锅灶。改建的办法是把原来直竖通向屋顶外的烟囱去掉，把锅灶靠墙壁的一边打一个洞，让烟囱从墙洞通出。在墙壁外的短短一截烟囱，好像一个牛尾巴。
    肥东县星光农业合作社丁主任，带我去看一个“牛尾巴灶”和它熏成的一堆土肥。这堆土肥熏得乌黑，和一般拆下的灶土、炕土一样。这个灶就是由原来农家锅灶改造的。灶上有两口锅，一口锅近墙，一口锅离墙稍远。灶的另一面是两个火门，火门口的上部，各有一个短短的烟囱，这两个烟囱在离灶面一尺多高的地方衔接起来，到靠墙的地方就连成一个烟囱，从墙洞通到墙外。墙外牛尾巴烟囱的下面是一个土台子，在台子上垒了大堆的蓬松的土块，把牛尾巴烟囱包围起来。农民在屋内由火门把燃料放进灶里燃烧，烟回到火门口，便被火门口上部的烟囱抽到墙外，通向牛尾巴烟囱周围的土块。一天煮三顿饭，这堆土就能熏三次。六、七天，这堆土就被熏成肥料了。
    这种造肥的办法，好处很多：一、简单易行。丁主任和我到一个生产队，他在队里一个干部的家里，和泥瓦匠共同改造一个烟囱，只用了一个多钟头的时间。二、这种肥料可以大量制造。用牛尾巴灶熏土，六、七天换一次土，一次就能熏一千斤土肥。星光农业社，根据已改造的牛尾巴灶熏土造肥的成效算了一笔账：全社只要有70％社员家里的锅灶改成牛尾巴灶，就有三千多个灶在造肥；一个灶一月熏四次，每次一千斤，全社就能在一月内得到一千三百多万斤土肥。三、可以增加社员的收入。据去年六安县联盟农业社的试验，每亩地施熏肥五千斤和每亩施五十五斤饼肥的效用一样，所收玉米产量都是二百六十斤。一亩地买五十五斤饼肥施用，合三元八角多。如果用买肥料的钱收购社员熏的土肥，一个每月能熏四千斤土肥的农家就可以得到三元二角钱的收入， （以八分钱一百斤算）。（附图片）
