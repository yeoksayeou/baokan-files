    “Man's Greed Knows No Bounds, Like a Snake Trying to Swallow an Elephant”
    Dong Jin
    Since the anti-Rightist struggle began, I have often heard people say: "These Rightist fellows, the Communist Party has treated you well! What are you doing? It's truly a case of man's greed knows no bounds, like a snake trying to swallow an elephant."

    I think these words are quite reasonable, representing a basic morality of old Chinese society: "Repay kindness with kindness," rather than "Repay kindness with resentment."

    People like Zhang Bojun entered the Northeast Liberated Area, staying in the best hotels, enjoying the best treatment, and having people greet them wherever they went. The reason for this was simply that they still had a so-called democratic life in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Looking back at the military and civilians in the Northeast Liberated Area at that time, they not only faced a serious war, but also economized in all aspects to support the victory of this war. Comparing the two, one can indeed draw the conclusion: the Communist Party treated people well.

    According to my memory, people like Luo Longji began to instill reactionary political science into students as early as 1931 (I went to China Public School in Wusong, Shanghai in 1930 and received his teaching), and he also edited "New Moon," openly planning for Chiang Kai-shek on how to oppose the Soviet Union, oppose the Communist Party, and oppose the people. We were all surprised at the time: Aren't these people (referring to the New Moon School) all promoting and practicing aestheticism? How did they get involved in politics? But taking a closer look at the politics they were engaged in, it turned out they wanted to create a base in the cultural front in China for the British and American bourgeoisie. And now he is a minister, which, according to them, means he has joined the cabinet. This also shows that the Communist Party treats people well.

    Zhang Naiqi, one of the once-prominent Seven Gentlemen, served as the secretary-general and director of finance for the Gui系 warlords. At that time, we were often attacked by these so-called national troops and Japanese bandits. Even so, he is now also a minister, which, according to them, also means he has joined the cabinet.

    The Communist Party's policy of great unity has promoted them all, and they have greatly shown their faces. Some of them have even become one of the national leaders, standing on Tiananmen Square and taking pictures with Chairman Mao in a row.

    What about some of their core members? How many of them have ever been well-known? It was only because of the Communist Party's policy of great unity that they successively became cadres in various aspects of our country. This should also be said that the Communist Party treats people well, indicating that the Communist Party does not prevent others from getting involved in national affairs, but hopes that everyone—all Chinese people (except counter-revolutionaries) with virtue and talent—will get involved.

    I remember that when the Rightist Zhang Yun Chuan went to Korea to express condolences, he rode in a car and stayed in the most secure air-raid shelter at the Volunteer Army headquarters; after returning from the visit, he took a soft-berth train to visit various parts of the Northeast, and there were also Communist Party office workers accompanying them on and off the train, staying in hotels, and eating meals. He was still not satisfied, and once on the way to Changchun, he even cursed. This provoked a Communist Party member traveling with him, who said, "Compare, what have you done? Think about it, how much blood was shed to capture the railway you are riding on."

    Such accounts cannot be settled.

    However, these people are not satisfied, they also want to usurp higher positions. They are not working for the people, but are becoming officials who harm the people. I was chatting with a farmer in an agricultural cooperative, and he said: "These Rightist reactionary guys, the Communist Party and the people forgive them and give them food to eat, but they are still not satisfied, it is truly a case of 'man's greed knows no bounds, like a snake trying to swallow an elephant.'" After a while, he added: "Even if it's a venomous snake, you can't swallow an elephant."

    The Rightists are trying to swallow the elephant.

    Therefore, many people are angry, not entirely from class, from the Party, from many great principles, but because of this most commonplace principle—the most basic morality of being a person in China, which is violated.

    Why do people hate the Rightists so much now? Li Wanchun's opera, even when he sends tickets to his neighbors, no one goes to see it, because they are too stinky, and they violate the morality of being a person. The people are the most capable of distinguishing right from wrong. Now we can calculate that in the new society under the leadership of the Communist Party, our family alone has four members who have graduated from school and become cadres, and the others are all in school. Everyone's life is guaranteed, and my frail second sister even received 100 catties of peas, 60 catties of wheat, 40 catties of barley, and 18 yuan this year. Can you compare? "The sky in the liberated area is a bright sky, the Communist Party's kindness is endless," this kind of song is not casually composed, it comes entirely from the hearts of the people.

    Therefore, resolutely fighting the Rightists is not only necessary for consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party and building socialism, but also very necessary for establishing the basic morality of being a person in China.

    The Rightists are indeed venomous snakes, and they want to swallow our people's socialist elephant. We can only catch them all, let the people know that they are snakes, and venomous snakes, and remove all their venom.

    How can we not protect our elephant?

    “人心不足蛇吞象”
    冬今
    反右派斗争以来，常常听到一些人说：“这些右派家伙，共产党待你们不薄呀！你们这算干吗呢？真是人心不足蛇吞象”。
    我觉得这些话还是言之成理的，代表中国旧社会一个起码的道德：“以德报德”，而不是“以怨报德”。
    章伯钧之流进入东北解放区，他们住着最好的旅馆，享受着最好的待遇，出入都有人招呼。考其原因，不过觉得他们在国民党统治区还有一段所谓民主生活。反观当时东北解放区军民，他们不仅面前摆着严重的战争，而且为了支援这个战争的胜利，各方面都在节衣缩食。两相比照，确是可以得出一个结论：共产党待人不薄。
    根据我的记忆，像罗隆基这样的人，1931年就开始向学生贯输反动的政治学（我曾在1930年去上海吴淞中国公学受过他的教），并主编“新月”，公开替蒋介石策划如何反苏、反共、反人民。我们当时都奇怪：这些人（指新月派）不都是提倡和实践唯美派的艺术的吗？怎末也弄起政治来了？而仔细一看他们弄的政治，原来是要在中国为英美资产阶级在文化阵线上搞一个阵地。而今也身为部长，照他们的说法：已入了阁。这又说明共产党待人不薄。
    赫赫一时的七君子的章乃器，当过桂系军阀的秘书长兼财政厅长，当时我们正经常受着这些所谓国军同日寇的夹击。即使如此，他今天也当了部长，照他们的说法，也是入了阁。
    共产党的大团结政策，都使他们高升了，并且大大的露了头角。他们有的甚至成了国家领导人之一，上了天安门，和毛主席站在一排一起照像。
    他们下面的一些骨干分子，又何尝有几个见经传的呢？也不过是因为共产党的大团结政策，才先后成了我们国家各方面的干部。这也应该说是共产党待人不薄，说明共产党没有把国家的事不让别人插手，都希望大家——凡我中华人民（除反革命外）有德有才者都插一插手。
    记得右派分子张云川，到朝鲜去慰问的时候，坐小汽车，到志愿军司令部住最保险的防空洞；慰问归来，又坐软席火车到东北各地参观，还有共产党员的办公人员陪着他们上车下车、住旅馆、吃饭。他还不满意，有一次去长春的途上，他还骂。惹得一位同路的共产党员生气了，他说：“比比，你自己到底干了些什么？你想想，你坐火车的这条铁路，是流了多少血才夺来的”。
    这样的账是没法算的。
    然而，这些人并不满足，他们还想篡夺更高的职位。他们不是在为人民作事，而是在作害人民的官。我在一个农业社和一个农民闲谈，他就说：“这些右派反动家伙，共产党和人民宽恕他们，给他们碗饭吃，还不知足，真是“人心不足蛇吞象”。停了一会，他又说：“就是有毒的蛇，象你也是吞不了的”。
    右派分子就是在想吞象。
    所以很多人气愤，开始还不是完全从阶级，从党，从许多大道理上引起的，就是因为这一点最平庸的道理——中国人最起码的为人道德，有违这个起码的道德而引起的。
    为什么现在人民那末的讨厌右派——李万春的戏，他向左邻右舍送票都没有人去看，就是他们太臭了，有背为人的道德。人民是最能分是非的。如今可以算一算，在共产党领导下的新社会，我们家单上学毕业出来已经当干部的就是四个，其他都在上学，大家的生活都有保障，身体最差的二妹今年小季还分了一百斤豌豆，六十斤小麦，四十斤大麦，还有十八块钱。可以比一比吗？“解放区的天是明朗的天，共产党的恩情说不完”，这种歌又不是随便编出来的，是完全出自人民的内心。
    所以现在坚决斗右派分子，不仅是为了巩固共产党的领导，建设社会主义需要，而且为了树立中国人为人的起码道德也很需要。
    右派分子确实是毒蛇，它们想吞掉我们人民的、社会主义的大象。我们只有把它们通通捉住，让人民都知道它们是蛇，而且是毒蛇，把它们的毒液全部去掉。
    我们大家怎末能不保护我们的象呢？
