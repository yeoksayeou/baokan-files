    Talking about the "Leap August"
    Li Huiping
    This year's lunar calendar has a "leap August." In our country, there has always been a saying among the people that "a leap August is not auspicious," such as "leap July, not leap August; a leap August will bring death." In fact, this is a superstitious legend and has no scientific basis. Now let's talk about what a "leap August" is all about.
    Most people always think that the lunar calendar refers to the lunar calendar, so they are mostly accustomed to saying, for example, "lunar × month × day," which is the same as "yinli × month × day." In fact, this statement is incorrect.
    There are three types of calendars: the lunar calendar, the solar calendar, and the lunisolar calendar. The Chinese lunar calendar is the lunisolar calendar (or old calendar), the Muslims use the lunar calendar, and the solar calendar is used worldwide. The solar calendar is based on the Earth's movement to define the year, month, and day. The time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds, which is called a tropical year, and that is the true length of a year. For the sake of easy calculation, a year is set at 365 days, which has an error. After four years, there will be a difference of one day, so it is stipulated that any year in the Gregorian calendar that can be divided by four is a leap year; that is, a regular year is 365 days, and a leap year is 366 days. This is how solar leap years are generated.
    The lunar calendar was created a long time ago. At that time, people calculated dates according to the changes in the moon's phases, that is, from new moon to new moon, or from full moon to full moon, which is counted as one month. This is the basis of lunar calculation. The time it takes for the moon to revolve around the Earth is 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 3 seconds, which is called a synodic month. For the sake of easy calculation, it is set as 30 days for a long month and 29 days for a short month. In this way, the time for twelve months in a year is only 354 days, which is more than 11 days less than a solar year, so the method of leap months is used to adjust it. Accumulate for about three years, and there will be a difference of more than one month. In order to make up for this difference, a month will be added every three years or so. China's lunar calendar used the method of placing seven leap months in nineteen years very early on. Because: a solar year is 365.2422 days, and nineteen years is 6939.6018 days; a lunar month is 29.5306 days, and 235 months is 6939.691 days, and 235 months is equal to nineteen years and seven months, so in the lunar calendar, in nineteen years, adding seven leap months, the seasons can basically be fixed, which is the reason why the lunar calendar has leap months.
    The lunar calendar adds seven leap months in nineteen years, so in which year and which month are these seven leaps inserted? That is related to the solar terms.
    Our country's calendar scholars call the orbit of the sun in the sky the ecliptic, which is actually a reflection of the Earth's revolution around the Sun. The ecliptic is divided into 24 equal parts, which becomes the 24 solar terms. The 24 solar terms are divided into twelve solar terms and twelve mid-terms. Each solar term and mid-term are arranged alternately, and the mid-term and solar term in a certain month of the lunar calendar are fixed. For example, Rain Water is set as the mid-term of the first month, Autumn Equinox is the mid-term of the 8th month, Beginning of Spring is the solar term of the first month, and White Dew is the solar term of the 8th month.
    In the solar calendar, there will be a solar term and a mid-term every month, and the distribution dates of each solar term and mid-term are roughly fixed: for example, Qingming must be around April 5th in the solar calendar, and Autumn Equinox must be around September 21st. But in the lunar calendar, every month does not necessarily have a solar term and a mid-term at the same time. Because the lunar calendar averages 29.5306 days per month, but the interval between solar terms, or between mid-terms, is an average of 30.5306 days. The time between a solar term and a mid-term is often slightly more than half a lunar month. In this way, it is possible that there is a mid-term at the end of a certain month in the lunar calendar, and its next solar term is in the middle of the next month, and sometimes it does not intersect with the mid-term until the end of the month. Therefore, in the next month, there will only be a solar term and no mid-term.
    The solar calendar must have a solar term and a mid-term every month. In nineteen years, there are 228 solar terms and 228 mid-terms; but in the lunar calendar's 235 synodic months, there are seven months with only solar terms and no mid-terms. Therefore, the ancients stipulated that any month without a mid-term should be used as the leap month of the previous month. In this way, there are exactly seven leap months in nineteen years.
    This year, August 25th in the solar calendar is the new moon, and September 24th is also the new moon, so from August 25th to September 24th, it is a month in the lunar calendar; and September 23rd is the Autumn Equinox, which is the mid-term of the 8th month in the lunar calendar, so this month in the lunar calendar is the 8th month. October 23rd in the solar calendar is also the new moon, so from September 24th to October 23rd in the solar calendar, it is another month in the lunar calendar; the mid-term of the month after the Autumn Equinox, that is, the mid-term of the 9th month in the lunar calendar, is Frost's Descent, and this year's Frost's Descent is on October 24th. In this way, there is no mid-term between September 24th and October 23rd in the solar calendar, and a month of the lunar calendar during this period is a leap month. The name of its previous month is used as the name of the leap month, which is called leap August. This is the source of leap August.

### 谈“闰八月”

    谈“闰八月”
    李惠萍
    今年农历有个“闰八月”。我国民间向有“闰八月不吉祥”的说法，如“闰七不闰八，闰八用刀杀”等，实际上这是一种迷信的传说，是毫无科学根据的。现在我们就来谈谈“闰八月”是怎么一回事吧。
    一般人总以为农历是指阴历来讲的，所以大都习惯说如农历×月×日就说是阴历×月×日，实际上这种说法是错误的。
    历法共分三种：阴历、阳历和阴阳历，中国用的农历就是阴阳历（或称旧历），回民用的是阴历，全世界通用的是阳历。阳历是根据地球的运动来规定年月日的，地球绕太阳转一周所需要的时间是三百六十五日五时四十八分四十六秒，叫一回归年，这才是一年真正的时间。为了计算方便起见，一年定为三百六十五日，这里面是有着误差的，四年后就要相差一天，于是就规定凡公元年数能被四整除的这一年就为闰年；那也就是平年为三百六十五日，闰年为三百六十六日，阳历闰年就是这样产生的。
    阴历很古时候就产生了，那时人们就按月亮圆缺变化来计算日期，就是从朔到朔，或从望到望算为一个月，这就是阴历计算的基础。月亮绕地球一周所需要的时间是二十九日十二时四十四分三秒，叫一朔望月。为了计算便当，就定为大月三十天，小月二十九天，这样则一年十二个月的时间只有三百五十四天，比阳历一年少了十一天多，所以要用闰月的方法来加以调整。积累三年，就约差了一个多月，为了弥补这个差数，三年左右就要增加一个月。我国的农历很早就用了十九年置七个闰月的方法。因为：阳历一年是三百六十五点二四二二日，十九年就是六千九百三十九点六零一八日；阴历一个月是二十九点五三零六日、二百三十五个月是六千九百三十九点六九一日，而二百三十五个月等于十九年和七个月，所以在阴历十九年里面，加上七个闰月，季节基本上就可以固定，这就是农历有闰月的缘故。
    农历十九年加七个闰月，那末，这七个闰插到那年那月呢？那就是与节气有关系。
    我国的历法学家把太阳在天空中所走的轨道叫做黄道，实际上是由于地球绕太阳公转的反映。把黄道分成二十四等分，于是就成了二十四节气。二十四节气又分为十二个节气和十二个中气。每个节气和中气都是相间排列的，而且在农历某个月一定固定的那一个中气和节气。比方说，雨水定为正月的中气，秋分是8月的中气，立春是正月的节气，白露是8月的节气。
    在阳历里，每月都会有一个节气和一个中气，各节气，中气分布日期大致是固定的：比方说，清明一定在阳历的4月5日前后，秋分一定在9月21日前后。但在农历里，每月不一定都同时有一个节气，一个中气。因为农历每月平均是二十九点五三零六日，可是节气与节气之间，或中气与中气之间相隔平均是三十点五三零六日，一个节气和一个中气相隔的时间，往往比阴历半个月稍为多一些，这样一来，可能在农历某一个月的月底有一个中气，在它下一个的节气是在下个月的月中，有时到月底还交不上中气。因此，下一个月份里，只会有一个节气而没有中气了。
    阳历每个月一定有一个节气和一个中气，在十九年中有二百二十八个节气和二百二十八个中气；但在农历二百三十五个朔望月里，有七个月只有节气，而没有中气。于是古人就规定凡是没有中气的那一个月作为前一个月的闰月，这样刚好十九年有七个闰月。
    在今年阳历8月25日是朔，9月24日又是朔，所以从8月25日到9月24日是农历的一个月；而9月23日是秋分，秋分是农历的8月中气，所以在农历这个月是8月。阳历10月23日又是朔，所以从阳历9月24日到10月23日又是农历的一个月；秋分下一个月的中气，就是农历9月的中气是霜降，而今年霜降在10月24日，这样则从阳历9月24日到10月23日之间没有中气，而这阶段的农历的一个月就是闰月，而用它前一个月的名称，作为闰月名称，就是叫做闰八月，这就是闰八月的来源。
