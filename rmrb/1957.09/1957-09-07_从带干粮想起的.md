Thoughts triggered by bringing dry rations
　　Zihang

　　The day before yesterday, I read "Petőfi's Selected Poems." A poem titled "Black Bread" was very moving:

　　Are you worried, dear mother,
　　Because your bread is so coarse and black?
　　When your son is away from home,
　　Perhaps he has whiter bread to eat.
　　It doesn't matter, just give it to me,
　　Mother, no matter how coarse and black it is.
　　The coarse, black bread of home,
　　Is more delicious than any white bread anywhere.

　　Thus, I thought of the "prodigy" writer Liu Shaotang. For him, the steamed buns of his hometown were already difficult to swallow. In order to eat palatable food when going "deep" into life, he was not afraid of being cumbersome and troublesome. He steamed dry rations in Beijing and then brought them from Beijing all the way to his hometown. This is the first time I've heard of such an interesting anecdote about a writer's life! Here, there is no trace of Petőfi's ardent love for his homeland. Liu Shaotang has long forgotten the canal hometown that nurtured him, and he even despises the food of his hometown. What is there to talk about loving it! But if he doesn't go down, he won't have writing material. In this way, wouldn't the writer's reputation, enjoyment, royalties... all become a problem?

　　Writing this, I remembered Liu Shaotang coming to Peking University as a guest last year. One day, the Peking University Literary Society organized a meeting between several young writers who participated in the National Youth Literary Creators Conference and literature enthusiasts from Peking University. Gao Yubao, Cui Ba’wa…, and Liu Shaotang also attended. That day, a classroom in the Philosophy Building was crowded with male and female students who had a strong interest in literature and were enthusiastic, innocent, and slightly immature. Everyone gathered in several groups to talk with the young writers. The atmosphere was very lively, and it was difficult to hear speakers who spoke softly or stood slightly behind. I remember Gao Yubao was sweating profusely and kept wiping his forehead with a handkerchief.

　　Liu Shaotang and Cui Ba’wa were in one group. Liu Shaotang had studied at Peking University for a year, so he naturally felt familiar with it. But what did he say? He sat leisurely in his chair, leaning back, one leg crossed over the other, constantly smoking cigarettes, with a suave demeanor. Many people whispered, "Look, how smug he is, he certainly has the air of a writer!"

　　Liu Shaotang spoke first. He said some seemingly modest but actually conceited words: "I only stayed at Peking University for a year, I only listened to half of 'Introduction to Literary Theory,' I didn't read much of the History of Chinese Literature... I don't have much writing experience..." I couldn't listen anymore. I ran to Gao Yubao's group. Gao Yubao sincerely talked to everyone about his difficult writing process. He, wearing the shoulder mark of a captain, with a thin, sallow face, did not have the somewhat pretentious and suave demeanor of Liu Shaotang, but his simple and sincere feelings attracted me like a magnet.

　　Seeing the news in the newspaper that Liu Shaotang had degenerated into a rightist, my roommate and I also talked about this past event last year. He said: Liu Shaotang didn't care whether everyone still wanted to listen to Cui Ba’wa's speech that day and only spoke for more than an hour. Now it seems that he also expressed many fallacies that day. He said that the problem of conceptualization and formularization in creation is not mainly due to insufficient immersion in life, but mainly due to improving the writer's artistic skills. You see, he hated going deep into life even then!

　　From Liu Shaotang's ingratitude, we started talking. In the end, everyone had a common feeling, which is: for young people living in happiness, whoever forgets humility, forgets the immensity of heaven and earth, forgets the people who nurtured him—the Party, and wants to deviate from the socialist path, will be abandoned. That's how life is!

    从带干粮想起的
    子航
    前天读“裴多菲诗选”，一首题为“黑面包”的诗，写得很动人：
    你在担心吗，亲爱的母亲，
    因为你的面包那么粗黑？
    你的儿子不在家的时候，
    也许他有更白的面包吃。
    这没有关系，你就给我吧，
    母亲，无论它多么粗黑。
    老家的粗黑的面包啊，
    比哪里的白面包更好吃。
    于是，我想起了“神童”作家刘绍棠，对于他，老家的馒头已经难于下咽，为了下去“深入”生活时能吃可口的饭食，竟不怕累赘和麻烦，把干粮在北京城蒸好，再从北京大老远的带到老家。我还是第一回听说这样的作家生活趣闻呢！这里，已经丝毫看不到裴多菲那种对乡土的如饥如渴的热爱了。刘绍棠对哺育过他的运河故乡，早已经忘本了，连老家的吃的都厌恶了，还谈什么热爱！但是要不下去吧，又没有了写作的素材，这样一来，作家的名望、享受、稿费……岂不都成了问题吗？
    写到这里，我想起去年刘绍棠到北京大学来做客的事情来。有一天北大文学社组织了参加全国青年文学创作者会议的几位青年作家和北大的文艺爱好者会见。来参加的有高玉宝、崔八娃……，也有刘绍棠。那天，哲学楼的一个教室挤满了对文学有浓厚兴趣的、热情、天真而稍带稚气的男女同学。大家围成几堆，同青年作家们谈话。会场上十分热闹，发言者说话声小或者站得稍微靠后就听不清楚。记得高玉宝就累得满头大汗。不住的用手帕擦额头。
    刘绍棠和崔八娃在一组，刘绍棠在北大学习过一年，对北大自然有熟悉之感。可是他说些什么呢？他悠然地坐在椅子里，身子往后仰着，一条腿架在另一条腿上，不断吸着香烟，风度潇洒。不少人都低声说：“瞧，满神气哩，倒是作家的派头！”
    刘绍棠首先开腔。他说了些貌似谦虚、实是自负的话：“到北大才呆了一年，‘文艺学引论’才听了一半，中国文学史也读了不点……写作也没有什么经验……。”我有点听不下去了。跑到高玉宝那里，高玉宝倒是满诚恳地给大家讲着他写作的艰苦过程，他，带着上尉的肩章，瘦削、焦黄的脸庞，没有刘绍棠那种有点造作的潇洒自负的风度，但他那质朴实在的感情却像磁石一样吸引住了我。
    看到报上新闻，刘绍棠已经堕落为右派分子，我和同屋的同学也谈起了去年这段往事。他说：刘绍棠那天也不管大家还想不想听崔八娃的发言，只顾自己讲了一个多钟头。现在看来，那天他也发表了不少谬论。说创作的概念化、公式化问题，主要不在于深入生活不够，主要的是提高作家的艺术技巧问题。你们看，那时候他就厌恶深入生活哩！
    从刘绍棠的忘恩负义，我们就谈开了。谈到临了，大家都有一个共同的感觉，那就是：对于生活在幸福中的青年人，谁如果忘记了谦逊，忘记了天高地厚，忘记了哺育他的人——党，想离开社会主义的轨道，谁就会被抛弃。生活，就是这样！
