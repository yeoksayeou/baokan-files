Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th. Twenty-five senior intellectuals in Tianjin have been approved to join the Chinese Communist Party recently after undergoing strict testing in the struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements.

Under the long-term education and cultivation of the Party, these senior intellectuals have established a communist outlook on life and have actively studied their professions and done their work well. Some have made achievements in scientific research; some have been selected as model workers or advanced workers. In the anti-Rightist struggle, they stood on the Party's position and defended the Party's interests from beginning to end. Luan Quanxun, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Tianjin Civil Architectural Design Institute, has always been active in his work and close to the organization. During the blooming and contending period, at an engineer symposium in the institute, members of the right-wing group, with the China Democratic League group as the core, jointly attacked the Communist Party. Luan Quanxun stood up on the spot and dealt a head-on blow to the right-wing elements. He emphasized that the Party's rectification must be led by the Party, and firmly said: "Some people ridicule me for not standing at the 'crossroads.' I think there is no other road today, only the socialist road." After the meeting, the right-wing elements put up big-character posters scolding him for "flattering." Luan Quanxun also put up big-character posters to counterattack the right-wing elements. Zhang Lizhen, Associate Professor of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tianjin University, usually actively studies his profession. In the scientific research group he led, after repeated research, he finally developed a method for manufacturing "heat-treated gears." When the great blooming and contending began, Zhang Lizhen saw the right-wing elements frantically attacking the Communist Party, and proposed that helping the Party rectify its style should start from the desire for unity, and that opinions should be based on facts. When the right-wing elements everywhere slandered him for "obstructing" the blooming and contending and threatened him, he did not waver. When he saw the right-wing elements in the school using big-character posters to spread rumors and abuse, and to carry out personal attacks on party member cadres, he put forward "opposing personal attacks and opposing abuse" in the school newspaper to fight back against the right-wing elements. He also used his feelings in the old and new society to educate students to stand firm, love the new society, and not be deceived by right-wing elements. Professor Pan Zhengtao, Director of the Chemical Engineering Department of Tianjin University, promptly refuted this reactionary statement with various facts when the right-wing elements clamored for "the Party committee to withdraw from the school," and proposed that "the Party committee cannot withdraw from the school, but must strengthen its leadership over the school." When the right-wing elements frantically attacked the Communist Party, and some people believed that "the dynasty should be changed," he resolutely requested the school party committee to join the Chinese Communist Party.

    经过反右派斗争严格考验
    天津一批高级知识分子入党
    新华社天津6日电　天津市二十五名高级知识分子，在反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，经过严格考验，已在最近被批准加入中国共产党。
    这些高级知识分子在党的长期教育和培养下，树立了共产主义人生观，并且积极钻研业务，做好工作。有些人在科学研究方面做出了成就；有些人曾被选为劳动模范或先进工作者。在反右派斗争中，他们自始至终地站在党的立场，维护党的利益。天津民用建筑设计院副主任工程师栾全训，工作一贯积极，并靠拢组织。鸣放期间，在院内工程师座谈会上，以民盟小组为核心的右派集团成员联合向共产党进攻，栾全训当场站起来给右派分子以迎头痛击。他强调党整风必须由党领导，并且坚定地说：“有人讥讽我不要站在‘十字路口’，我认为今天没有别的路，只有社会主义一条路。”会后，右派分子贴出大字报骂他“拍马”。栾全训也贴出大字报反击右派分子。天津大学机械系副教授张力真，平时积极钻研业务，在他领导的科学研究小组中，经过反复研究，终于研究出制造“热轨齿轮”的方法。大鸣大放开始时，张力真看到右派分子向共产党猖狂进攻，就提出帮助党整风要从团结愿望出发，提意见要实事求是。当右派分子到处诬蔑他“阻碍”鸣放并对他进行威胁时，他也毫不动摇。在他看到校内右派分子利用大字报造谣谩骂、对党员干部进行人身攻击时，他就在校刊上提出“反对人身攻击，反对谩骂”来回击右派分子。他还以自己在新旧社会的感受，教育学生站稳立场、热爱新社会，不要被右派分子蒙蔽。天津大学化工系主任潘正涛教授在右派分子叫嚣“党委退出学校”时，他及时地用各种事实驳斥这种反动言论，并提出“党委不能退出学校，而是要加强对学校的领导。”当右派分子对共产党猖狂进攻，有些人认为“要改朝换代”的时候，他向校党委坚决要求加入中国共产党。
