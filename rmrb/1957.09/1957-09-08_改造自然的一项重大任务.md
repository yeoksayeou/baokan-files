    The formulation and promulgation of the "Provisional Outline of Water and Soil Conservation of the People's Republic of China" are of great significance for developing mountain production and fundamentally controlling river disasters.
    In many mountainous and hilly areas of our country, due to the destruction of forests, the indiscriminate cultivation of slopes, and the lack of vegetation cover for the soil, severe soil erosion has occurred for a long time and has been intensifying. According to preliminary estimates, the area of soil erosion nationwide reaches more than 1.5 million square kilometers. The Yellow River basin is the most severely affected, accounting for 580,000 square kilometers. In the middle reaches of the Yellow River, an average of 3,700 tons of soil per square kilometer is eroded annually. In these areas, due to the massive erosion of surface soil, soil fertility is declining, and soil water storage capacity is reduced, resulting in drought during normal times and flash floods during rains. Therefore, natural disasters are frequent, seriously hindering agricultural production. At the same time, soil erosion in the upper reaches causes the riverbed in the lower reaches to rise year by year, which makes floods frequent in the plains as well.
    Strengthening water and soil conservation is a major task in developing agricultural production and transforming nature. Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government, in order to reduce drought and flood disasters and develop mountain production, have led the broad masses to carry out water and soil conservation work, and have achieved certain results. By the end of 1956, the country had initially controlled soil erosion over an area of more than 140,000 square kilometers. After comprehensive management in many areas, soil erosion has been basically stopped, resulting in a significant increase in agricultural production and a fundamental change in the appearance of mountainous areas. In the Yanbei area of ​​Shanxi Province, the water and soil conservation experience of Daquanshan in Yanggao County was promoted, and in the past year, 2,554 gullies were managed, and on more than 2.28 million mu of land, it was initially achieved that soil does not go down the slope and water does not leave the gully. In Wushan County, Gansu Province, the water and soil conservation experience of Dengjiabao was promoted, and more than 30 villages have basically stopped soil erosion. Combined with irrigation, the average yield of grain per mu increased from 102 jin before liberation to 202 jin, and the average grain owned per person increased from 300 jin to 500 jin. Jiyuan County in Henan has carried out comprehensive management in recent years, and now three-quarters of the county's soil erosion area can be controlled. In many areas, water and soil conservation work has become a conscious action of the masses, and it has been carried out on a large scale from point to area.
    However, the development of water and soil conservation work is far from meeting the needs of agricultural production and national construction. Cultivated land in mountainous and hilly areas of our country accounts for a large proportion of the total cultivated land area. However, agricultural yields in these areas, especially in the vast Loess Plateau region of the north, are still very low, and most of the water and soil conservation work has not been done well, which is very detrimental to improving the lives of the local people and to the control of rivers and the prevention of drought and flood disasters. Some areas have not only failed to carry out any construction, but have even seen phenomena such as indiscriminate felling of trees, indiscriminate cultivation of steep slopes, scraping of sod, and digging of tree roots, which promote soil erosion. In Shiqiao Township, Luotian County, Hubei Province, 200,000 jin of grain were harvested from wasteland on slopes in 1954-1955; however, due to the floods caused by wasteland reclamation, 755 mu of paddy fields under the mountains were buried by sediment, resulting in a loss of 370,000 jin of grain. Houses and livestock were also damaged. This is truly a case of more harm than good! Several large reservoirs that have been built in our country are being threatened by sediment deposition because the water and soil conservation work in the upper reaches is not keeping up. Therefore, in order to develop the national economy, water and soil conservation work must be greatly strengthened.
    Practice in recent years has proved that "overall planning, comprehensive development, combining slope and gully management, and centralized management" is the correct guideline for carrying out water and soil conservation work, and it must be conscientiously implemented in the future. Water and soil conservation is a comprehensive measure related to production and construction in mountainous areas. Only through overall planning, rational use of land, unified arrangement of various measures, and unified allocation of labor can the contradictions between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations be effectively resolved. Water and soil conservation planning should be based on agricultural cooperatives. Within the scope of an agricultural cooperative, management should be carried out from the watershed to the foot of the slope, from branch gullies to main gullies, from top to bottom, from small to large, storing water at each level, intercepting sand in sections, and managing slopes and gullies. In the management process, engineering measures (such as silt detention dams, valley dams, terraced fields, and field ridges) should be closely combined with agricultural and forestry biological measures (such as improving agricultural cultivation techniques, afforestation, and grass planting) to gradually transform the terrain, improve the soil, and achieve the purpose of water and soil conservation and increased production. In the past, some areas one-sidedly emphasized one measure and neglected other measures in water and soil conservation work, which was incorrect. Some areas misunderstood the principle of centralized management, so that the manpower and materials of various townships and societies were concentrated on the management of a small watershed area, which was divorced from the current production needs of a township and a society, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Attention should be paid to avoiding this bias in the future.
    Water and soil conservation work must adhere to the mass line and be mainly self-managed by the masses. Labor required for water and soil conservation work and other production should be arranged in a unified manner. The work points earned from this kind of labor should be distributed in the same way as other labor work points. Some cooperatives in Wanquan County, Hebei Province, have organized water and soil conservation professional teams, and some areas have implemented quota contracting for water and soil conservation, and have incorporated this contracting into the production team's contracting plan. These methods can be adopted by various places after consideration. The funds for water and soil conservation mainly rely on the cooperatives themselves. The state-subsidized funds should be guaranteed to be used in the areas where water and soil conservation has the greatest benefits. The state should help cooperatives overcome financial difficulties, but should not subsidize too much.
    The weakness of technical forces is one of the common difficulties encountered in water and soil conservation work at present. Shanxi Province completed 37,650 earth dams last year. Due to poor technical guidance and poor project quality, 7,121 were washed away by water after heavy rains. The cross-sections of the contour trenches built in some areas are too large, taking up too much land, and the masses are not satisfied. The terraced fields and field ridges built in many areas are not up to specifications, not only failing to play a role in storing water and intercepting mud, but also aggravating the erosion of mountain water. The survival rate of trees planted in some areas is very low. All of these indicate the importance of strengthening technical guidance and improving work quality. In order to solve this problem, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the training of water and soil conservation work cadres, and on the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen technical teaching among the masses, and pay special attention to summarizing and promoting the successful experiences that already exist among the masses.
    Some areas still do not place water and soil conservation work in an important position, and often abandon this task when other tasks are tight. In the future, all areas with water and soil conservation work tasks should establish the necessary work organizations and actively guide the broad masses to carry out water and soil conservation work. This work must be closely coordinated by relevant departments in order to achieve results. In the past, some areas lacked unified leadership and overall planning, and various business departments did their own thing, and their strength was scattered. In the future, unified leadership and deployment should be strengthened, and relevant departments should closely cooperate.
    The vast people in the mountainous areas of the country, agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy workers across the country, and scientific workers in water and soil conservation, everyone should, under the leadership of the Party and the government, take on this arduous task with the heroic spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountains.

### 改造自然的一项重大任务

    改造自然的一项重大任务
    “中华人民共和国水土保持暂行纲要”的制定和公布，对于开展山区生产，根治河流水患，都有极其重大的意义。
    我国许多山区和丘陵区，由于森林被破坏，山坡被滥垦，土壤缺乏植物庇护，长期以来发生了严重的水土流失现象，而且愈演愈烈。据初步估计，全国水土流失面积约达一百五十多万平方公里。黄河流域情况最严重，占五十八万平方公里。黄河中游地区平均每年每平方公里被冲刷的土壤达三千七百吨。这些地区由于地面的土壤大量冲蚀，土壤肥力日益减退，土壤蓄水能力降低，所以平时苦旱，遇雨又暴发山洪，因此自然灾害很多，严重地妨碍了农业生产。同时，上游水土流失，下游河床就会逐年淤高，这就使得平原地区也经常发生水灾。
    加强水土保持工作是发展农业生产、改造自然的一项重大任务。解放以来，党和人民政府为了减轻水旱灾害，发展山区生产，领导广大群众开展了水土保持工作，已经获得了一定的成绩。至1956年底，全国已初步控制水土流失面积十四万多平方公里。不少地区经过综合治理以后，已经基本上制止了水土流失现象，因而农业生产显著增加，山区面貌发生根本变化。山西省雁北地区推广了阳高县大泉山的水土保持经验，在去年一年中治理了二千五百五十四道沟，在二百二十八万多亩土地上初步做到土不下坡，水不出沟。甘肃省武山县推广了邓家堡的水土保持经验，有三十多个村庄基本上停止了水土流失，结合灌溉，使粮食每亩平均产量由解放前的一百零二斤增加到二百零二斤，每人平均所有的粮食由三百斤增加到五百斤。河南济源县几年来进行综合治理，现在全县水土流失面积的四分之三已经可以控制。在不少地区，水土保持工作已经成为群众自觉的行动，由点到面，大规模地开展起来。
    但是，水土保持工作的发展还远不能适应农业生产和国家建设的需要。我国山区和丘陵区的耕地，在耕地总面积中占很大的比例。而这些地区，特别是北方广大的黄土高原地区，农业产量仍然很低，水土保持工作大部分还没有做好，这对于改善当地人民生活，对于河流的治理和水旱灾害的防治，都非常不利。有的地区不但没有进行什么建设，甚至还发生了滥伐树木、滥垦陡坡、铲草皮、挖树根等促进水土流失的现象。湖北省罗田县石桥乡在1954—1955年两年中，在坡地开荒收获粮食二十万斤；但是由于开荒而致山洪成灾，泥沙压埋山下水田七百五十五亩，损失粮食三十七万斤。房屋和牲畜也受到损害。这真是得不偿失！我国已经建成的若干大型水库，由于上流的水土保持工作跟不上，正在受着泥沙淤积的威胁。所以，为了发展国民经济，水土保持工作必须大大加强。
    几年来的实践证明，“全面规划，综合开发，坡沟兼治，集中治理”，是开展水土保持工作的正确方针，今后必须认真贯彻执行。水土保持是关系山区生产建设的一项综合措施，只有全面规划，合理利用土地，统一安排各项措施，统一调配劳力，才能有效地解决农业、林业、牧业、副业的矛盾。水土保持规划应该以农业合作社为单位。在一个农业合作社的范围内，应该从分水岭到坡脚，从支毛沟到干沟，由上而下，由小到大，节节蓄水，分段拦沙，成坡成沟地治理。在治理过程中，要把修筑工程（如淤地坝、谷坊、梯田、地埂等）同农林生物措施（如改善农业耕作技术、造林、种草等）密切结合起来，逐步改造地形，改良土壤，以达到蓄水保土、增加生产的目的，过去有些地区在水土保持工作中片面地强调这一措施，忽视其他措施，是不正确的。有的地区误解了集中治理的原则，以致把各乡各社的人力物力都集中在一个小集水面积的治理上，脱离了一乡一社当前生产的需要，引起了群众的不满。今后要注意避免这种偏向。
    水土保持工作必须坚持群众路线，以群众自办为主。水土保持工作和其他生产所需要的劳力要统一安排。这一种劳动应得的工分要同其他劳动工分同样分红。河北省万全县有些合作社组织水土保持专业队，有些地区实行水土保持定额包工，并且把这项包工纳入生产队的包工计划，这些办法各地可以斟酌采用。水土保持的经费，主要靠合作社自己解决。国家补助的经费，应该保证用在水土保持效益最大的方面。国家要帮助合作社克服资金困难，但是也不能补助过多。
    技术力量薄弱是目前水土保持工作中普遍遇到的困难问题之一。山西省去年完成土坝三万七千六百五十座，由于技术指导差，工程质量不好，经过暴雨后被水冲毁七千一百二十一座。有的地区修的水平沟断面太大，占地太多，群众不满意。许多地区筑成的梯田、地边埂不合规格，不但没有起到蓄水拦泥的作用，反而加重了山水的冲刷。有些地区植树成活率很低。所有这些，都说明加强技术指导和提高工作质量的重要性。为了解决这种问题，一方面要加强水土保持工作干部的培养，一方面要在群众中加强技术传授，特别要注意总结和推广群众中已有的成功经验。
    有些地区至今没有把水土保持工作放在重要地位上，往往别的任务一紧，就把这个任务丢掉了。今后，凡是有水土保持工作任务的地区应该把必要的工作机构建立起来，积极地指导广大群众开展水土保持工作，这个工作必须由有关部门密切配合，才能收到效果。过去有些地区由于缺乏统一领导和全面规划，各业务部门各搞一套，力量分散。今后应当加强统一领导和部署，使各有关部门密切配合。
    全国山区的广大人民，全国农业、林业、水利工作者们、水土保持方面的科学工作者们，大家应该在党和政府的领导下，用愚公移山的英雄气魄，共同把这项艰巨的任务担负起来。
