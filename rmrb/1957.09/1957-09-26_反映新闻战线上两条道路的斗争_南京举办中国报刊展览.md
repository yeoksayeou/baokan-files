Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 24th: The Chinese Newspaper and Periodical Exhibition held by the Nanjing Library began its preview for journalists on the 22nd. The official exhibition will begin around National Day.

The exhibition includes four parts: the establishment of Chinese newspapers and periodicals, the growth of people's newspapers, the role of newspapers in New China, and a special room for the anti-Rightist struggle in the journalistic field.

According to the introduction in the first part, China had "Dibao" (official gazettes) as early as the Han Dynasty, and "Kaiyuan Zabao" during the Tang Dynasty. The "Dibao" was renamed "Jingbao" during the Qing Dynasty. From the exhibited "Jingbao," "Political Gazette," and "Cabinet Gazette" of the late Qing Dynasty, it can be clearly seen that these early newspapers and periodicals were mouthpieces of the feudal ruling class in both content and form. After the Xinhai Revolution until the May Fourth Movement, it was the period of the establishment of modern Chinese newspapers and periodicals. The newspapers and periodicals exhibited from this period include: the newspaper edited by Liang Qichao advocating "venerating the emperor," the "Chinese Vernacular Newspaper" directly calling feudal rulers "people's thieves," and the "China Women's Newspaper" founded by revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin.

The second part covers the period from the May Fourth Movement to the founding of the People's Republic of China, which was the period of the growth of people's newspapers. Exhibited are the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party at the time of its establishment, forty-four kinds of mimeographed and letterpress newspapers from the liberated areas, and the New China Daily published in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. All the people's newspapers focused on the revolutionary struggles and labor creations resolutely carried out by the working people under the leadership of the Communist Party, in stark contrast to the bourgeois newspapers that focused on the lives of a few people in the ruling class and their anti-people conspiracies. A portion of the newspapers published in Chongqing during the democratic revolution, exhibiting different attitudes, strongly reflects how the same events were reported differently due to the different stances of the newspapers, as seen in the reports and editorials on the Southern Anhui Incident, the Jiaochangkou Incident, and the assassination of Wen Yiduo.

From the exhibited newspapers of New China, it can be seen that the people's newspapers have systematically promoted Marxism-Leninism over the past few years, educated and organized the people to participate in the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations, and extensively reported the inspiring construction achievements in various places.

During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, a struggle between two lines emerged on the news front. Comparing the period when Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily once took the bourgeois direction with the Party newspapers such as the People's Daily, it can be seen in many issues how the Rightists fabricated rumors and distorted facts in all aspects of interviewing and editing, and played tricks to frantically attack the Communist Party. The reactionary words and deeds of a handful of Rightists in the national and Jiangsu provincial journalistic circles are systematically displayed before the audience, completely exposing their true colors.

    反映新闻战线上两条道路的斗争
    南京举办中国报刊展览
    据新华社南京24日电　南京图书馆举办的中国报刊展览会，在22日对新闻工作者开始预展。正式展出将在国庆节前后开始。
    展览会包括中国报刊的兴办，人民报纸的成长，新中国报纸的作用，以及新闻界反右派斗争专室等四个部分。
    根据第一部分的介绍，我国从汉朝起有了“邸报”，到唐朝曾有“开元杂报”。“邸报”在清朝改名为“京报”。从展出的清朝末年的“京报”、“政治官报”、“内阁官报”等都可以看到，这种早期报刊从内容到形式都明白显示出是封建统治阶级的喉舌。以后历经辛亥革命直到“五四”，属于中国现代报刊的兴办时期。展出的这一时期的报刊有：梁启超主编的提倡“尊皇”的报纸，直呼封建统治者为“民贼”的“中国白话报”，革命先烈秋瑾主办的“中国女报”等。
    第二部分从“五四”运动到中华人民共和国成立，这是人民报纸的成长时期。展出的有中国共产党成立时的机关报，有解放区的四十四种油印和铅印报纸，有在国民党区出版的新华日报等。所有的人民报纸，都以劳动人民在共产党领导下坚决进行革命斗争和劳动创造为中心内容，同资产阶级报纸以统治阶级少数人生活起居和进行反人民的阴谋活动为中心恰成鲜明的对比。陈列出的一部分在民主革命阶段在重庆出版的不同态度的报纸，在有关皖南事变、较场口事件、闻一多被暗害等方面的报道和社论，强烈地反映出同一事件由于报纸的立场不同而作出不同的报道。
    从展出的新中国报纸看到，人民报纸几年来有系统地宣传马列主义，教育并组织人民参加五大运动和三大改造，大量地报道了各地鼓舞人心的建设成就。
    大鸣大放时期在新闻战线上出现了两条道路的斗争。以文汇报、光明日报一度走上资产阶级方向的时期和人民日报等党报对比，在许多问题上可以看到右派分子在采访、编排等各方面如何造谣歪曲，玩弄手法，向共产党猖狂地进攻。全国以及江苏省新闻界的一撮右派分子的反动言行，有系统地陈列在观众面前，彻底暴露出原形。
