　　Half of Families Can't Make Ends Meet
　　According to materials published by the U.S. government on the 10th, in 1956, among the 43 million families in the United States, half of the families had a total income of less than $4,700. According to current living expenses in the United States, a family of four needs to spend more than $5,500 a year to maintain an ordinary standard of living.
　　The statistics say that about seven million households (20% of all families) had an income of less than $2,000. Nearly three million households (7% of the total) had an income of less than $1,000.

    一半人家入不敷出
    据美国政府10日发表的材料，在1956年，在美国全国四千三百万个家庭中，有一半家庭的全部收入在四千七百美元以下。依照美国目前的生活费用，一个四口之家要维持一种普通水平的生活，一年需要开支五千五百美元以上。
    这项统计说，其中的大约七百万户（占全国家庭的20％）收入不到两千美元。近三百万户（占全部的7％）收入还不足一千美元。
