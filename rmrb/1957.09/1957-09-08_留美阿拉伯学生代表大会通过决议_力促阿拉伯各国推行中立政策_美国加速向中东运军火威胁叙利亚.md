Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Berkeley, California - The Arab Students' Representative Assembly in the United States passed a resolution on the 6th, strongly urging all Arab countries to pursue a "policy of positive neutrality and non-alignment." The resolution also urged the governments of Syria and Egypt to "accelerate the establishment of a federation" as the "first step" toward building an alliance of "all Arab nations." The resolution stated that although the Arab people are separated into several countries, they constitute "an indivisible nation."

The five-day representative assembly opened on the 3rd. The conference also passed a resolution stating that the Gulf of Aqaba is Arab territorial waters. It urged "all relevant Arab governments to prohibit Israeli ships from passing through the Gulf of Aqaba."

The four hundred student representatives attending the meeting accused Britain's intervention in Oman and the Buraimi Oasis as stemming from Britain's desire to plunder Arab oil, and they advocated continuing the "struggle to smash the shackles of British occupation."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Washington - US State Department Press Officer Reid confirmed on September 6 that the United States is accelerating the delivery of arms to pro-Western countries in the Middle East. He said that the accelerated arms delivery work began several days ago.

Subsequently, the US Department of Defense also announced: "The weapons urgently supplied to Jordan will be transported on September 9 by eight giant Air Force Globemaster transport aircraft." According to US officials, the United States is accelerating the provision of military equipment to Jordan in order to consolidate the position of pro-Western forces in the country and instigate pro-Western countries in the Middle East to oppose Syria.

Senator Mansfield bluntly said that the practice of stepping up the delivery of American weapons to Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq is to enable "those who hold different opinions" within Syria to "re-establish order on an appropriate basis."

The Associated Press reported that Dulles, after talking with Henderson, is planning to regard Turkey, which shares a 900-kilometer border with Syria, as the "axis" of the United States' actions in the region. The report also said that the US Department of Defense is discussing the issue of providing further military and economic "assistance" to Turkey.

    留美阿拉伯学生代表大会通过决议
    力促阿拉伯各国推行中立政策
    美国加速向中东运军火威胁叙利亚
    新华社7日讯　加利福尼亚州柏克莱消息：阿拉伯留美学生代表大会6日通过决议，力促阿拉伯各国都推行“积极中立和不参加集团的政策”。决议并且力促叙利亚和埃及政府“加速成立联邦”，作为建立“所有阿拉伯民族”联盟的“第一步”。决议说，阿拉伯人民虽然隔离为若干国家，但是构成了“一个不可分割的民族”。
    这个为期五天的代表大会是在3日开幕的。大会还通过一项决议说，亚喀巴湾是阿拉伯的领海。它力促“所有有关的阿拉伯政府禁止以色列的船只通过亚喀巴湾。”
    出席会议的四百名学生代表们指责英国对阿曼和布赖米绿洲的干涉是出于英国掠夺阿拉伯石油的欲望，他们主张继续“斗争以粉碎英国占领的羁绊”。
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官里德9月6日证实美国正在加速向中东的亲西方国家运送军火。他说，加速运送军火工作早在几天前就开始进行了。
    接着，美国国防部也宣布：“急速供给约旦的武器9月9日将用八架巨大的空军全球霸王运输机运送。”据美国官员透露，美国加速给予约旦军事装备，是为了巩固这个国家的亲西方势力的地位，并且策动中东亲西方国家反对叙利亚。
    参议员曼斯菲尔德露骨地说，加紧把美国武器运给约旦、黎巴嫩、土耳其和伊拉克的做法，是要使叙利亚国内“怀有不同意见的人在适当的基础上重新建立秩序”。
    合众社报道说，杜勒斯同汉德逊谈话后，正计划把同叙利亚有九百公里交界线的土耳其看作是美国在这一地区行动基础的“轴心”。报道还说，美国国防部正在讨论对土耳其提供进一步的军事和经济“援助”问题。
