Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency reports: The United States is intensifying its threats against Syria. Following the open provocation of five American warships sailing near the Syrian coast on September 8, the United States has also carried out provocative activities through Syria's pro-Western neighbors.
　　
Syrian Army Spokesman in Damascus said on the 10th that three armored vehicles of the Israeli army fired at two Arab settlements in the demilitarized zone on the Israeli-Syrian border that day, killing one Syrian. The spokesman said that some other Israelis also opened fire on Syria at the same time, and two Israeli Air Force jet planes flew over the demilitarized zone and Syrian airspace.
　　
According to the Associated Press, citing Ankara authorities on the 10th, Turkish troops are busy holding military exercises on the Syrian border. Prior to this, there have been reports that the United States places its greatest hope on Turkey in its plan to attack Syria.
　　
According to the Istanbul "National Daily" on the 9th, Colonel Husseini, the former Syrian military attache in Rome, one of the main figures involved in the U.S.-orchestrated plot to subvert the Syrian government, has arrived in Istanbul. The "National Daily" quoted diplomatic sources as saying: "Syrians who oppose the current Syrian government are gathering in one place to form a 'Free Syrians Committee,' and Colonel Husseini plays an important role in this committee." The newspaper concluded by saying that they chose Turkey because it is "closest to Syria" and is the "most steadfast" country.
　　
At the same time, according to a United Press report from Washington, U.S. Navy authorities revealed on the 9th that the main part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet is currently operating in the "eastern part of the central Mediterranean." United Press said, "The U.S. Navy has always used flag-waving in or near troubled areas of the world" to "powerfully demonstrate American military strength."
　　
United Press also quoted U.S. officials as saying that the U.S. plan to transport arms to pro-Western countries in the Middle East, especially Syria's neighbors, is being stepped up. In the past few days, the United States has transported a batch of aircraft, mortars and other weapons to Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The news said that Iraq and Turkey will also receive some F-86 and F-100 jet fighters. The first batch of the ten million U.S. dollars in arms for Jordan has also been shipped on the 9th.

　　美国加紧威胁叙利亚
　　通过以土等国进行挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国正在加强对叙利亚的威胁。在9月8日五艘美国军舰驶近叙利亚海岸进行公开挑衅后，美国又通过叙利亚的亲西方邻国进行了挑衅活动。
    叙利亚陆军发言人10日在大马士革说，以色列军的三辆装甲车这天在以色列和叙利亚边境的非军事区向两个阿拉伯居民点开火，打死了一个叙利亚人。发言人说，另外还有一些以色列人也一道向叙利亚开火，这时，有两架以色列空军的喷气式飞机飞过非军事区和叙利亚上空。
    据美联社援引安卡拉权威人士10日的话透露，土耳其军队正忙于在叙利亚边境举行军事演习。在这以前，已经有消息透露，美国在进攻叙利亚的计划中把最大的希望寄托于土耳其。
    据伊斯坦布尔“国民报”9日报道，参加美国策划的颠覆叙利亚政府阴谋案的主要分子之一、前叙利亚驻罗马武官侯赛尼上校已经到了伊斯坦布尔。“国民报”援引外交人士的话说：“反对叙利亚现政府的叙利亚人都聚集到一处，成立‘自由的叙利亚人委员会’，侯赛尼上校在这个委员会中起着重要作用”。报纸最后写道，他们选中了土耳其，是因为它“最靠近叙利亚”并且是“最坚定的”国家。
    在这同时，据合众社从华盛顿报道，美国海军当局9日透露，美国第六舰队的主要部分目前正在“中地中海东部”活动。合众社说，“美国的海军历来用在世界多事地区内或附近展扬旗帜”，“有力地显示出美国的军事力量”。
    合众社还援引美国官员们的话透露，美国向中东的亲西方国家、特别是叙利亚的邻国运送军火的计划已在加紧进行。在过去几天中，美国已经把一批飞机和迫击炮等武器运到了伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯。消息说，伊拉克和土耳其还将得到一些F—八六和F—一○○型的喷气战斗机。美国给约旦的一千万美元军火中的第一批也已经在9日运到。
