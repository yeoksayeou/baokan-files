    Sichuan Can Increase Grain Production by 2.2 Billion Jin
    (Our Newspaper) According to reliable data recently estimated by relevant departments in Sichuan, on the basis of last year's bumper harvest of 44.5 billion jin of total grain output, it is still possible to increase net production by 2.2 billion jin this year.
    Due to the strengthening of the leadership of the Party and the government over agricultural production, and the increased enthusiasm for production among the broad masses of farmers after cooperation and last year's bumper harvest, the province generally increased the planting area of double-cropping rice this year, and achieved early planting and close planting of rice. At present, the more than 43 million mu of mid-season rice, which accounts for the largest rice area, has been harvested, with an average yield of 498 jin per mu. The more than 10 million mu of early rice, which has already been harvested, has an average yield of 470 jin per mu, an increase of 6.8% over last year. Corn is one of the three major grain crops in Sichuan's spring planting. Production decreased last year. This year, the planting area reached more than 20 million mu. After the harvest in July, the yield per mu was 161 jin, an increase of 9.3% over last year.
    Since August, although some late rice in seven special districts, including Nanchong and Luzhou, has suffered from severe drought, the drought situation has been alleviated through active drought resistance. It is estimated that late rice will still increase production compared to last year.

    四川可增产粮食二十二亿斤
    本报讯　最近四川有关部门根据可靠资料估计：在去年粮食总产量四百四十五亿斤大丰收的基础上，今年仍可净增产二十二亿斤。
    由于党和政府对农业生产领导的加强、广大农民在合作化和去年丰收以后生产积极性的提高，今年全省普遍增加了双季稻种植面积，做到了水稻的早栽密植。目前水稻面积最大的四千三百多万亩中稻已收割完毕，平均亩产量四百九十八斤。早已收割完毕的一千多万亩早稻，平均亩产达四百七十斤，比去年增产6.8％。玉米是四川大春中三大粮食作物之一，去年减产，今年种植面积达二千多万亩，在7月份收割完毕后，亩产一百六十一斤，比去年增产9.3％。
    8月以来，南充、泸州等七个专区的部分晚稻虽遭受严重干旱，经过积极抗旱，旱情有所减轻。估计晚稻仍将比去年增产。
