　　Cellophane Workshop Equipped with Scrap Materials
    The cellophane workshop of Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill was built with an investment of less than 100,000 yuan. Normally, it would require at least 400,000 yuan for factory buildings and machinery. The cellophane produced has good moisture resistance, high tensile strength, and good transparency.
    The cellophane workshop consists of eight separate rooms. Three rooms are old warehouses that used to store paper, and five rooms are sheds with roofs and brick walls. The reporter visited all the machinery and equipment in the cellophane workshop. In the alkali dissolving room, three different shapes of alkali dissolving pipes were seen. One was made by connecting gasoline barrels, another was a waste digester originally used for steaming pulp, and the third was converted from a waste boiler. In another room, three old vertical baling machines were converted into horizontal impregnation squeezing machines; in the process of crushing wood pulp raw materials, the crusher originally needed to be imported from abroad at a price of 35,000 yuan, but here they used a cotton gin and two meat grinders used by butcher shops, costing only 303 yuan in total. The highly demanding hexagonal drum sulfurizer and double-layer insulated dissolving mixer were made by the factory workers using old iron plates. However, the cellophane forming room is the culmination of scrap materials. On the very important forming paper machine, what we saw were old motors, old drive shafts, old gears, old belts, waste rollers, and waste drying cylinders, etc. The two drying cylinders were discarded by other paper mills for many years, and not only had insufficient air pressure and heat, but also had pitted surfaces. After being ground with a grinding wheel, turned with a lathe, and then rubbed with fine sand, and finally coated with a layer of acid-resistant paint to increase smoothness, crystal-clear cellophane was continuously produced once installed on the paper machine. A special nozzle installed in front of the paper machine is made of precious alloys in many countries, with an import price of over 60,000 yuan. Here, glass is used as the nozzle, costing only 150 yuan each.
  The cellophane workshop is currently being expanded. After completion at the beginning of next year, the equipment will be slightly balanced to produce one ton of cellophane per day. The entire expansion cost can be recovered in four months, and a large amount of foreign exchange used to purchase cellophane from abroad can be saved.

### 用废料装备的玻璃纸车间

　　用废料装备的玻璃纸车间
    天津市第一人民造纸厂的玻璃纸车间，用不到十万元的投资建立起来了按照通常情况至少需要四十万元的厂房和机器。生产的玻璃纸防潮性能很好，拉力大，透明度也不错。
    玻璃纸车间是彼此隔开的八间屋子。三间是以前堆纸的旧仓库，五间是上面盖了棚，外面砌了墙的棚子。记者参观了玻璃纸车间的全部机器设备。在化碱室看到了三种不同形状的化碱管。一种是由汽油桶接起来的，另一种是原来蒸纸浆用的废蒸球，还有一种是由废锅炉改成的。在另一个屋子里，有三个原是立式的旧打包机被改成了卧式的浸渍压榨机；在粉碎木浆原料的工序上，粉碎机原需要从国外进口，价格三万五千元，但这里却用了一台弹棉机和两架肉店用的绞肉机，总共只花了三百零三元。要求很高的六方鼓磺化机和双层保温溶解搅拌机是厂里工人用旧铁板做的。然而，集废旧物料之大成的还是玻璃纸成型室。在非常重要的成型纸机上，看到的是旧马达、旧传动轴、旧齿轮、旧皮带、废滚轴和废烘缸等等。两个烘缸原是其他纸厂扔了多年的，非但气压热度不足，而且表面坑坑洼洼，经过这里用砂轮磨，用车床旋，再用细沙擦，末了涂上一层增加滑度的耐酸漆，等装上纸车就陆续不绝地制造出晶亮晶亮的玻璃纸来了。装在纸机前部的一个特殊的喷嘴，许多国家用的是贵重合金制的，进口价格达六万元以上。这里用玻璃做喷口，每个只花了一百五十元。
  玻璃纸车间现在正在扩建，明年年初完工以后，设备稍加平衡将日产一吨玻璃纸，四个月就可以收回全部扩建费用，并且可以节省大量向国外购买玻璃纸用的外汇。
