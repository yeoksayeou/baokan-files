A Difficult Journey
By Our Correspondent Zhong Lin

Last September, after graduating from junior high school, Xiao Liu entered the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant as an apprentice. He originally thought that he would learn some technology well in the factory, and create a universal tool fixture like Wang Chonglun. How glorious that would be!

After entering the factory, the factory organized the masters to give technical common sense lessons to the new apprentices, talking about boilers, switchboards, steam turbines..., Xiao Liu found it boring. Later, the masters took them to visit these things. Xiao Liu was very interested in the visits. He especially envied those who worked in front of the switchboard in snow-white clothes.

After the visit, Xiao Liu was assigned to the welding section of the repair workshop. When he looked at the workshop, there were so many lathes, greasy, with iron filings and black ash on the ground, and water splashed in some places. He was wearing a new pair of sneakers, hesitating how to set foot. Later, he tiptoed in carefully. Somehow, a little black ash stained his pants, and he hurriedly patted it with his hand, feeling very annoyed, thinking that this job was so dirty! Then he saw an old worker wearing a protective mask, half-squatting and half-kneeling, holding a welding machine and sparking, sweating profusely. He felt even more annoyed: this job is not only dirty but also tiring. He was planning to find a way to go back to school.

Xiao Liu stood listlessly to the side for a few days. The masters sometimes asked him to help deliver things, sprinkle water, sweep the floor, and do some cleaning work. He was very annoyed: when he was a cleaner at school, it was his turn only once every few days; as an apprentice in the factory, he had to do this every day, wouldn't that be too underutilized! After a few more days, the welding team leader asked Xiao Liu to sign a master-apprentice contract with Master Yang to learn welding. Xiao Liu remained silent, thinking: this welding job is so simple, what technology can I learn? He planned to ask to be transferred to another place; if not, he would go home and find a way to go to school.

The team leader and Master Yang saw through Xiao Liu's thoughts and were not angry. They discussed it, and the next day when they were working, Master Yang called out, "Xiao Liu, come and try it!" Xiao Liu put on a protective mask and picked up the welding machine to work. Alas! Why doesn't this thing listen to me? It turned out that he didn't even know the basic movements of welding. This time, Xiao Liu felt ashamed to realize that welding is not simple! Then, the welding team leader called Xiao Liu for a talk. After the team leader explained the performance and function of electric welding in detail, he said, "Electric welding is also a specialized knowledge to serve socialist construction. In this industry, there are electric welding engineers and electric welding experts." The team leader also advised Xiao Liu not to despise manual labor, not to be afraid of dirt and fatigue, and to learn from Master Yang. For many days after that, Master Yang often took the time to hold Xiao Liu's hand to teach him how to weld, explaining while working. Xiao Liu also bought a book about electric welding to read, and he became more convinced that electric welding is a specialized knowledge. Therefore, his interest in learning to weld gradually increased, and he was no longer afraid of getting dirty.

In a power plant, overhauls are very tense. Once, Master Yang asked Xiao Liu to go with him to repair the boiler. When he got to the boiler, wearing good protective clothing, he told Xiao Liu the safety precautions to be taken after entering the boiler, and then he drilled into the boiler first. Xiao Liu followed in. Although the fire was extinguished in the boiler, the temperature was still as high as one hundred and several tens of degrees Fahrenheit. In less than two minutes, Xiao Liu felt his head swelling, and he broke out in sweat all over his body, so he quickly drilled out. Looking back at Master Yang, although he was also covered in sweat, he was working inside the boiler. After a while, Master Yang came out. Xiao Liu asked, "Master Yang, how can you stand it when it's so hot? Why didn't you come out earlier to rest?" Master Yang said, "You can stand it after exercising. How can you weld the boiler on time if you rest casually? If the boiler is not welded well, how can you generate and transmit electricity on time? If our work is delayed for a while, and the factory cannot generate and transmit electricity on time, how much of the country's production will be delayed?" Xiao Liu thought to himself, "Master Yang can persist in working in such a hot boiler, why can't I stand it as soon as I enter the boiler?" He felt ashamed and realized that his labor will was not firm. He said to Master Yang that he hoped to take him in again next time he repairs the boiler, and he must learn to work in high temperatures.

The second time he repaired another boiler, Xiao Liu followed four masters into the boiler. This time, it was the same, his head was swelling from the heat, and he was sweating all over, but when he saw the four masters waiting for him to deliver tools, he gritted his teeth and persevered. After working in the boiler for seven minutes, he felt unspeakably happy after coming out. In the last two major repair jobs, Xiao Liu has been able to persist in the boiler for about twenty minutes.

Once, in the workshop, Xiao Liu started singing out of excitement. This made other people who were working intently very unhappy. Master Yang told him that this affected other people's work and told him not to sing. Another time, Xiao Liu felt a little tired, so he ran out to rest without saying a word. Master Yang couldn't find him when he had something to do. When he came back, Master Yang said to him that this was a violation of labor discipline and that he couldn't just leave casually in the future. Another time, a fitter learning test was held during working hours. Xiao Liu finished answering the questions and went back to the dormitory to play. Master Yang couldn't find him when he had something to do. The next day, Master Yang asked him why he violated labor discipline again and went back to the dormitory before work was over. He said, "I thought it was the same as taking an exam at school, and I could go home after handing in the paper." Master Yang said to him, "This is a factory, and the continuity and concentration of work are very strong. You can't just leave during working hours. If you have something that you have to leave, you have to explain it; you should go back to the workshop after answering the questions, because there is still work to do!" For a long time after entering the factory, Xiao Liu always missed the school system of resting for ten minutes after fifty minutes of class. Now, he said that he has realized the reason why the factory cannot do that, and he also realized that he must abide by labor discipline. However, even such a small change in understanding seems so difficult! Not long after this, one day after get off work, the doors of the workshop were locked. He climbed through the window, wanting to turn on the power switch to learn how to operate the machine, but he was immediately discovered and stopped, and he was severely criticized for this and wrote a self-criticism.

The public opinion in the factory played a strong supervisory role over Xiao Liu and his partners. Once, just after receiving their wages, Xiao Liu and several other apprentices walked into the cafeteria, arguing along the way, competing to see who bought the most things, whose shoes were prettier, and whose clothes were made of better material. When they got to the food buying window, they wanted to compete to see who bought the best food. Therefore, they were picky, complaining that this dish didn't have much meat, and that dish didn't have enough oil... A master chef in the kitchen couldn't bear it any longer and said, "I've never heard you compete to see who does more work, who learns better skills, and whose thinking is progressing faster; I only hear you compare eating, wearing, and showing off. You don't look like apprentices at all, you're simply 'apprentice masters'!"

The words of this master chef immediately resonated in the cafeteria, and everyone discussed it. One worker said, "It's this Xiao Liu. His master taught him the craft so painstakingly. Once, when his master was working and asked him to pour a bowl of water, he poured it with a kettle, but there was no water in the kettle, so he put it down and ignored it. Later, after a long time, someone else fetched a kettle of water before he poured it for his master!" Someone at another dining table said, "That time in the collective dormitory, two groups of apprentices had a group fight, and Xiao Liu and the others were among those who made self-criticisms!" Someone else said, "Xiao Liu and the others put watermelon peels on the road, but hid beside it. When they saw people walking on the road stepping on the watermelon peels and falling, they laughed heartily. This is really too naughty!"... Xiao Liu and the other apprentices blushed, lowered their heads, and quickly finished their meal and slipped away. They no longer competed to see who ate better.

Over the past few months, Xiao Liu and his partners have also changed their views on the old workers, especially recognizing that the technology mastered by the old masters did not come easily. At a master-apprentice symposium held in the workshop, many old workers talked about their painful experiences as apprentices in the old society, which moved Xiao Liu and many other apprentices. According to the old masters, before liberation, to become an apprentice in a factory, you had to find a guarantor and draw up a written agreement. The agreement stipulated that: if you do not listen to the master's words or abide by the rules, you will be punished; if you do not learn halfway, you will have to pay the factory for the meal money; the factory is not responsible for accidents such as injuries or deaths during work; and so on. An old master named Shang, when he was an apprentice, slept on a bed of straw on the wet ground at night, and as a result, he suffered from a cold leg disease. Although he was treated after liberation, his old illness still recurs from time to time, and he can't move at all. The old workers also told them that before liberation, the main job of apprentices was to do odd jobs for the masters and housework for the bosses (some masters were the bosses). They even had to hold the boss's wife's child, pour the chamber pot, and run errands, and they had to work for ten to sixteen or seventeen hours a day. But it was extremely difficult to learn a craft. Apprentices had to serve the masters very well in order to make them happy, and the masters would only teach you a little bit of skill. When the masters were doing crucial work, they would send the apprentices away, not even letting them watch. You couldn't ask about things you didn't understand, and even if you asked, they wouldn't tell you, or they wouldn't tell you the truth. Therefore, many of the technical experiences that the old workers now possess were accumulated by themselves in production practice.

But now, take Xiao Liu and his apprentices for example: as soon as they enter the factory, they have collective dormitories to live in; they have cafeterias to eat in; they only work six days a week, and only eight hours a day; when learning a craft, not only do the old masters carefully impart their skills, but also people give technical lessons. If there are things you don't understand, someone will answer them as long as you ask; from the time they enter the factory, they receive a monthly salary of twenty-five to thirty yuan, and they also enjoy labor insurance benefits. The Party, the government, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League often care about them in various ways and try to solve their difficulties. Sometimes on Sundays, the old masters even take them out to play. ...

The old masters often said to Xiao Liu and his apprentices: "You are the successors of socialist construction. We will follow the instructions of the Party and not only teach you all our skills, but also guide you on the right path politically and ideologically. You have some culture and understand some principles, so you should learn faster and you will definitely learn better than us. You should study hard and contribute more to socialist construction. If you don't study hard in today's new society with such good conditions, you will be letting down the Party, the country, and the people!" These words touched the heartstrings of Xiao Liu and his partners, inspiring them to study hard. In fact, although they still have many shortcomings or are constantly making various mistakes, they have made progress in their studies and in their thinking.

Xiao Liu's mother came to see him from afar once. She saw that the dormitory he lived in was not bad. His quilt was thin, and when the weather turned cold, the trade union found a thicker cotton quilt to lend him. She heard that after receiving his salary, the old masters told him not to spend it recklessly and helped him plan how to allocate it reasonably, telling him to send some money home. An apprentice suffered from a small intestinal hernia, and the factory not only sent him to the hospital for treatment, but also often sent people to visit him. Xiao Liu's mother said that this was more attentive than at home. When his mother left, she repeatedly told Xiao Liu to work hard. Xiao Liu said, "Now I'm convinced that the factory is my home, and I must listen to the old masters and study hard to learn skills."

    艰苦的历程
    本报记者　钟林
    去年9月，小刘在初中毕业后，考进了天津第一发电厂作学徒。他原来想，到工厂里好好学点技术，像王崇伦那样创造个万能工具胎之类，那多光彩啊！
    进厂后，厂里组织师傅们给新来的一批学徒讲技术常识课，讲的是锅炉呀，配电盘呀，汽机呀……，小刘觉得没意思。后来，师傅带他们参观了这些东西。小刘在参观当中倒很有兴趣，他尤其羡慕那些穿着雪白的衣服在配电盘工作的人。
    参观完了，小刘被分配到修配车间的烧焊工段去。他一看，车间里那么些车床，油腻腻的，地下有铁屑、黑灰，有的地方还溅了水，他穿着一双新球鞋，踟躇着不知怎么下脚才好。后来，他踮着脚小心翼翼地走进去。不知怎么，裤子上忽然沾上了一点黑灰，他赶忙用手去拍打，心里很厌烦，觉得干这个活多脏啊！再一看，一个老工人戴着防护面具，半蹬半跪地拿着焊接器在嗤火，满头流着汗。他心里更厌烦了：这个活不仅脏，还累。他盘算着想个办法仍然上学去才好呢。
    小刘无精打采地站在旁边看了几天，师傅们有时叫他帮着递点东西，还叫他洒洒水，扫扫地，做些清洁工作。他心里很恼火：在学校里当清洁值日生，好多天才轮着一回啦；在工厂里当学徒，天天要干这件事，岂不太屈才了么！又过了些日子，烧焊班班长叫小刘跟杨老师傅订师徒合同，学烧焊活。小刘默不作声，心里想：这烧焊活多么简单啊，能学到什么技术呢？他打算要求调换到别的地方去；不行就回家想法上学去。
    班长和杨师傅看透了小刘的心意，也没生气，他俩合计了一下，第二天干活的时候，杨师傅叫道：“小刘，你来试试看！”小刘就戴上防护面具，拿起焊接器来要干活。嗳呀！这东西怎么不听使唤呢？原来，他连作焊接活的基本动作都不会。这一下，小刘才惭愧地感到：干焊接活也不简单呀！接着，烧焊班班长找小刘去谈话了。班长详细讲了电焊的性能和功用之后，说：“电焊也是为社会主义建设服务的一种专门学问，在这一行里，有电焊工程师，也有电焊专家。”班长还劝小刘不要轻视体力劳动，不要怕脏怕累，并且要他好好跟杨师傅学习。以后一连好多天，杨师傅常抽时间把着小刘的手教他干焊接活，一边干还一边讲着。小刘又买了一本关于电焊的书来看，更相信电焊是一种专门学问，于是，他学干焊接活的兴趣逐渐大起来了，也不怕脏了。
    在发电厂里，大修是很紧张的事。有一次，杨师傅叫小刘跟他检修锅炉去。到了锅炉跟前，穿着好防护服装，他又告诉了小刘进锅炉以后要注意的安全事项，就先钻进锅炉里去了。小刘也跟了进去。锅炉里虽然熄了火，但温度还高达华氏一百几十度，不到两分钟，小刘觉得脑袋发胀，哗的一下就全身冒汗了，他赶快钻了出来。回头一看杨师傅，虽然也是浑身大汗，但他正在锅炉里边工作着。过了好一会，杨师傅才出来了。小刘问道：“杨师傅，那么热你怎么能受得了？你怎么不早出来歇歇呢？”杨师傅说：“锻炼锻炼就受得了啦，随便就歇歇怎么能按时焊好锅炉呢？锅炉焊不好，怎么能按时发电送电呢？要是我们手里的工作耽误了一会儿，工厂不能按时发电送电，国家的生产得耽误多少啊？”小刘心里想：“杨师傅能在那么热的锅炉里坚持工作，我为什么一进锅炉就受不了呢？”他感到惭愧，意识到自己的劳动意志不坚决。他对杨师傅说，下次检修锅炉的时候，希望还带他进去，他一定要学会在高温里作工作。
    第二次检修另一个锅炉的时候，小刘跟着四个师傅到锅炉里去了。这一回，同样是热得脑袋发胀，浑身流汗，但他看见四个师傅在等着他递送工具，他一咬牙就坚持住了。在锅炉里干了七分钟，出来以后，他觉得有说不出的愉快。最近两次干大修活，小刘已经能在锅炉里坚持二十来分钟了。
    有一回，在车间里，小刘一高兴就唱起歌来了。这使得别的正在专心干活的人很不高兴。杨师傅告诉他，这影响别人的工作，叫他不要唱。另有一回，小刘觉得有些累了，他不啃气就跑出去休息去了，杨师傅有事找他也找不着。回来以后，杨师傅对他说，这是违反劳动纪律的事，以后可不能随便就走。又一回，在上班时间里举行钳工学习测验，小刘答完了试题就回宿舍玩去了。杨师傅有事找他又找不着。第二天，杨师傅问他为什么又违犯劳动纪律，没到下班时间就回宿舍了。他说：“我以为这跟在学校里考试一样，交了卷就可以回家了。”杨师傅对他说：“咱们这是工厂，工作的连续性和集中性很强，上班时间是不能随便走开的，有事非走开不可也得有个交代；你答完试题应该回到车间里来，因为还有工作啦！”在进工厂后的好长一段时间里，小刘总是很留恋学校里上了五十分钟课就休息十分钟的制度。现在，他说他已经认识到工厂里不能那样作的道理了，也认识到要遵守劳动纪律了。可是，就这么一点小小的认识上的改变，似乎也是多么不容易啊！这以后不久，有一天下班了，车间的门都锁上了，他翻窗子进去，想打开电闸学开机器，但马上就被人发现加以制止了，他因此受到严厉的批评，并且写了检讨书。
    厂里的舆论对小刘和他的伙伴们起了强有力的监督作用。有一次，刚发了工资，小刘和别的几个学徒，一路吵吵嚷嚷着走进食堂，他们在比赛着谁买的东西多，谁的鞋漂亮，谁的衣服料子好。走到买菜的窗口，他们要比赛看谁买的菜好，于是，就挑肥拣瘦，嫌这个菜肉不多，嫌那个菜油少，……。厨房里一位大师傅实在看不过意了，就发话道：“就没听见过你们比赛谁的工作做得多，谁的本领学得好，谁的思想进步快；尽听见你们比吃比穿比阔气。你们这哪里像学徒，简直是‘徒弟爷’！”
    这个大师傅的话，在食堂里立即引起了共鸣，大家议论纷纷。有一位工人说：“就是这个小刘啊，他师傅那么苦心地教他学手艺，有一回他师傅在干活，叫他给递碗水，他拿壶一倒，壶里没有水，他就放下不管了。后来，呆了好一会，还是别人去提了一壶水来，他才给师傅倒啦！”另一张饭桌上有人说：“那回在集体宿舍里，两帮子学徒打群架，后来作检讨，也有小刘他们几个啊！”还有人说：“小刘他们把西瓜皮扣在道上，却藏在旁边，看见走道的人踩着西瓜皮摔了跤，他们就哈哈大笑。这真顽皮得太不像话！”……。小刘他们几个学徒红着脸，低着头赶快把饭吃完就溜了。他们以后也不再比赛谁吃得好了。
    几个月来，小刘和他的伙伴们，对老工人们的看法也有点改变了，特别是认识到老师傅们所掌握的技术来得很不容易。在车间里召开的一次师徒座谈会上，许多老工人讲了他们在旧社会里当学徒的痛苦经历，这使小刘和别的许多学徒们很受感动。据老师傅们谈：解放前，到工厂里当学徒，要找保人立下字据，字据上规定着：不听师傅的话、不守规矩就任凭处罚；半途不学就得算账赔偿厂里的饭钱；工作当中发生伤亡等事故与工厂无干；等等。在场的一位姓尚的老师傅，在当学徒的时候，夜间铺床席睡在潮湿地上，结果患了寒腿病，解放后虽然经过治疗，现在有时还旧病复发，动也动弹不得。老工人还告诉他们，解放前，当学徒的主要活是给师傅打杂和给老板做家务事（有的师傅就是老板），甚至要替老板娘抱孩子、倒便桶、跑街，每天都要干十至十六七个钟头的活。但要学点手艺却是困难极了，学徒得伏伏贴贴地把师傅侍候得很高兴，师傅才教给你一星半点手艺。师傅干关键性的活的时候，就要把徒弟支开，连看也不让看。不懂的事也不能问，问了他也不讲，或者讲也不讲真话。因此，现在的老工人们所会的一些技术经验，许多都是靠他们自己在生产实践中积累起来的。
    可是，现在呢，就拿小刘他们这批学徒来说吧：一进厂，住有集体宿舍；吃饭有食堂；工作一星期才作六天，每天才作八小时；学手艺吧，不仅有老师傅把着手精心传授，还有人给讲技术课，不懂的地方，只要提出来就有人给解答；从进厂起，每月就有二十五至三十元的工资，还享受劳动保险待遇。党、政、工、团还常常从各方面关心他们，有困难就设法给解决。有时星期天，老师傅还带他们出去玩。……
    老师傅们常常对小刘他们这些学徒说：“你们是社会主义建设的接班人，我们听从党的指示，不仅要把所有的本领通通教给你们，还要在政治上思想上把你们引上正路。你们有点文化，也懂得些道理，学起来应该比较快，也一定能比我们学得好。你们可应该好好学，为社会主义建设多尽点力才对。如果你们在今天这个新社会里，有这样好的条件还不好好学，那真太对不起党，对不起国家和人民了！”这些话，打动了小刘和他的伙伴们的心弦，激励着他们好好学习。事实上，他们虽然还有不少缺点或不断犯着各种错误，但在学习上、思想上都还是有进步的。
    小刘的母亲有一次老远来看他，见他住的宿舍不错，他的被子薄，天凉了，工会还设法借了一条较厚的棉被给他。听说领了工资，老师傅就关照他不要胡花，还帮着他盘算怎样合理支配，叫他寄些钱回家去。有个学徒害了小肠疝气病，厂里不仅送他住院医治，还常常派人去慰问他。小刘的母亲说，这比家里还照顾得周到啦。母亲走的时候反复叮咛小刘好好干。小刘说：“现在我认准了，工厂就是我的家，我一定要听老师傅的话，好好学习本领。”（附图片）
