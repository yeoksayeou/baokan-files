　　Saving Gauze
    Refurbishing Flannel Clothes
    Flannel clothes usually wear out first at the collar, cuffs, and hem; flannel pants wear out first at the crotch. After these areas are worn out, many people stop wearing them. Now, the Beijing No. 1 Flannel Vest Production Cooperative has specially set aside a portion of its personnel and equipment to repair or alter flannel clothes, flannel pants, cotton sweaters, and cotton long johns for customers. They can replace worn-out collars, cuffs, hems, and crotches with new ones. If the flannel clothes and pants are too worn to be repaired, they will alter them into children's flannel clothes and pants, or use them to make children's shoes, gloves, and so on. (Li Xiuying)

    How to Mend Socks?
    Many people are unclear about whether socks wear out on the outside first or on the inside. For example, some people buy a new pair of socks and patch them on the outside before even wearing them, thinking that this will prevent the socks from wearing out so quickly. In fact, socks are constantly subjected to friction from the soles of the feet, so they wear out on the inside first, not the outside. Therefore, when you buy socks, it is best to patch them on the inside before wearing them. Some people patch them on the inside first, and after patching them three times, the outside still looks new.

    The best material for mending socks is old socks or old cotton knitwear. Both of these materials are elastic, making them sturdy and comfortable when used to patch socks. (Zi Xi)

　　节省纱布
    翻补绒衣
    绒衣一般是领口、袖口、下摆先破；绒裤是裤裆先破。这些地方破了以后，很多人都不穿它了。现在，北京市第一绒衣背心生产合作社，特别抽出一部分人员和设备，给顾客修补或翻改绒衣、绒裤、棉毛衫、棉毛裤。他们可以给破旧的绒衣、绒裤换上新的领口、袖口、下摆和裤裆。要是绒衣绒裤破得实在不能再修补了，他们就把它改成小孩的绒衣绒裤，或者用来做小孩鞋子、手套等等。        （李秀英）
    怎样补袜子？
    袜子究是外面先破还是里面先破，许多人是不清楚的。譬如有些人买了一双新袜子还没穿，就从外面补上几块布，以为这样袜子就不至于坏得那么快了。其实，袜子经常受脚底磨擦，最先坏的并不是外面而是里面。所以，买来袜子，在没穿以前还是先从里面补上再穿好。有人先从里面补，补了三次，外面还像新的一样。
    补袜子最好用破袜装，或旧棉线衣。这两种材料都是有松紧的，补在袜子上既结实又舒服。
