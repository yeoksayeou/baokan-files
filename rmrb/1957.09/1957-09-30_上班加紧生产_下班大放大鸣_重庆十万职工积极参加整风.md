    Working Hard in Production, Vigorously Speaking Out After Work
    100,000 Chongqing Workers Actively Participate in the Rectification Campaign
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Chongqing, September 29th) More than 100,000 workers from thirty factories, mines, and enterprises in Chongqing have enthusiastically thrown themselves into the rectification movement. With the attitude of masters of the country, they have put forward suggestions for improvement on various issues related to the work style of cadres, production management, and welfare in their respective units. Each unit has established special institutions to collect, sort out, and handle these opinions. During the rectification, democratic life in these factories, mines, and enterprises is very active. In Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant, over 66% of the workers in eight workshops have expressed their opinions. The 18,190 opinions they put forward in four days have immediately received the attention of leaders at all levels. Many cadres in the large open-hearth furnace workshop studied the opinions of the workers day and night. Chongqing Electrical Engineering Materials Factory adjusted the working hours of night shift workers so that 90% of the workers had the opportunity to participate in eight hours of discussion meetings every week. Each workshop also held workshop discussion meetings based on the group discussion meetings, with good results. By the 22nd, more than 70% of the workers in the factory had spoken, putting forward 3,879 opinions, many of which criticized the three major isms of leaders at all levels. The factory Party committee appointed three Party committee members to lead the organization for handling workers' opinions. The opinions put forward by the construction workers of Construction Site 104 have been processed in the first batch. When the results of the handling of workers' opinions were announced, the workers expressed a warm welcome and spoke even more enthusiastically.
    All factories and mines have made proper arrangements for both rectification and production in advance. Cadres of the Nantong Coal Mine at the mine and workshop levels are responsible for leading rectification and production respectively, and they held discussions with district team leaders and veteran workers to carefully study the specific methods for comprehensively fulfilling the state plan during the rectification period. The workers of China Wool Textile Factory have formulated a pact to ensure that rectification and production do not interfere with each other. The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant put forward the slogan "Work hard in production during work hours, vigorously speak out after work hours." During the rectification period, the large open-hearth furnace workshop launched a "three goods" competition for quality, saving, and safety.
