China has a long tradition of valuing ancient cultural relics, and the study of ancient cultural relics also has a long history. Roughly from the Han Dynasty onwards, people began to pay attention to unearthed cultural relics. Sometimes, when a feudal emperor obtained an ancient bronze artifact, he would change the reign title. In the era of feudal rule, people valued ancient cultural relics and treated them as treasures, hoarding and monopolizing them for personal appreciation, turning them into a kind of antique hobby. This was a bad trend. However, there was also a good aspect to its development, which was that some people paid attention to the organization and research of ancient cultural relics. For example, Xu Shen said in the preface to Shuowen Jiezi: "The commanderies and states often obtained tripods and Yi vessels from mountains and rivers, and their inscriptions were ancient texts from previous generations, all similar to each other." The great ancient philologist Xu Shen was very capable of using inscriptions on ancient artifacts to study the evolution of writing. In the Western Jin Dynasty, a large number of bamboo slips were discovered in the tomb of King Xiang of Wei in Jixian County. At that time, they were lost, but ancient scholars sorted out several Warring States classics from the remaining bamboo slips, including the famous "Bamboo Annals." By the Northern Song Dynasty, the study of bronze and stone artifacts had become a systematic field of study, with a period of brilliant achievements, such as Lü Daelin's "Archaeological Illustrations" and "Xuanhe Bogu Tu," which carefully illustrated ancient bronzes, measured them, and interpreted inscriptions, sometimes connecting them to history and geography. After the Northern Song Dynasty, this field of study did not develop. It was not until the Qing Dynasty that the study of epigraphy flourished again, with new achievements. Scholars such as Wu Dacheng, Sun Yirang, and Wang Guowei made excellent contributions to this field. However, in the old society, this kind of research was always limited by the times.

In the past hundred years, due to imperialist aggression, China became a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. Along with the political, economic, and cultural aggression of imperialism, our country's cultural relics were also subjected to their barbaric looting. Imperialist countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan all plundered a large number of China's precious cultural relics. On the one hand, imperialist elements directly stole them. For example, some of the murals in Dunhuang have been peeled off by them; many Buddha statues in Yungang in Datong, Longmen in Luoyang, and other places have been damaged, their heads cut off and arms broken, and transported away; the famous Tang Dynasty Zhaoling Six Steeds stone carvings in Xi'an were secretly transported away by the American imperialists, and the other four were also broken into several sections, ready to be smuggled away, but were stopped by the local people and did not make it out.

There were also some unprincipled national scum in our country who colluded with imperialist elements and sold a large number of cultural relics to foreign countries. Such as Yin and Zhou bronzes, rare ancient books, etc., many of which were sold to the United States. American cultural spies even shamelessly said: "Those who want to study Chinese learning in the future may have to come to the United States."

In semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, under the internal and external attacks of imperialist elements and national scum, the precious cultural relics above and below ground of the motherland suffered large-scale destruction. The number of ancient cultural relics sold to foreign countries was immeasurable. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe.

Many feudal dynasties in history also seriously damaged cultural relics. Feudal rulers sometimes regarded unearthed antiquities as ominous objects and greatly destroyed them. For example, the Northern Zhou Dynasty destroyed a large number of bronze statues and artifacts; some dynasties also destroyed many temples and Buddha statues and steles because of their rejection of Buddhism. The large number of fragmented Buddha statues unearthed in various places now is proof of this.

The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution liberated the people from long-term enslavement. The people regarded the affairs of the country as their own, and their labor enthusiasm soared to unprecedented heights. The productive forces were liberated, which is a force even more powerful than atomic energy. In the few years since liberation, the country's various construction undertakings have advanced by leaps and bounds. For example, the Yangtze River Bridge was originally scheduled to be completed in 1958, but it will be open to traffic this year, and it has also saved 3 million yuan in funding. The Party's achievements in various aspects of construction are there for all to see. Under the leadership of the Party, the cultural relics cause has also made significant achievements. First, the Party and the government promulgated a series of cultural relic protection laws to prevent the artificial loss and destruction of precious cultural relics; second, with the development of the country's basic construction, the rich underground museums and cultural relic warehouses were opened one after another, and the number of unearthed cultural relics was astonishing. In June of this year, when I went to Ceylon, I stopped in Kunming for a short period of time on the way back and forth. In the Yunnan Museum, I saw a large number of bronzes and gold artifacts, numbering in the thousands. It was truly amazing. These antiquities were excavated from the Dian King site in Shizhaishan, Jinning. There were two seals, one gold, with a snake knob, and the seal text was "Seal of the Dian King," and the other was a copper seal with the seal text "Seal of Shengxi." Judging from the form of the writing, they were relics from the Han Dynasty. There were also bronze drums, with three-dimensional figures welded onto the lid, depicting vivid scenes of life, such as wars, hunting, sacrifices, etc., very much like the customs of a slave society. From the images of these figures, their clothing, and the patterns on the artifacts, as well as the animal shapes on the weapons, they should belong to the culture of the southwestern ethnic minorities. This is just one example. In various parts of China, such as Changsha, Xi'an, Luoyang, etc., a large number of cultural relics have been unearthed.

Too many things are being unearthed too quickly, and the work of organizing and researching cannot keep up. There are too few people. This is a prominent problem, and it is also a very regrettable thing. However, the Party and the government attach great importance to this work. In the past few years, the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, the Archaeological Institute of the Academy of Sciences, and Peking University have jointly held four training classes to vigorously train archaeological workers. Archaeological work has been completely renewed compared to the past. Taking publications as an example, there are several such as "Archaeological Journal," "Archaeological Newsletter," and "Cultural Relics Reference Materials." China has thousands of years of history, and the richness of cultural relics above and below ground is rarely seen in other countries. Now, we should quickly cultivate new forces and expand the ranks of cultural relics research. The older generation of experts must increase their burden of cultivating talent to cope with the urgent task at hand.

We do not value ancient cultural relics for the sake of valuing them, nor do we study them for the sake of studying them. We must adhere to the correct socialist path in the ancient cultural relics research cause. Our policy is to use the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to excavate, organize, and study the rich material cultural products left to us by the ancients, and to thoroughly scientize them. Our purpose is to use the research and utilization of cultural relics to promote the patriotic spirit of the people. We want to make the people understand: These extremely precious cultural relics were created by our hardworking and intelligent ancestors, who spent countless physical and mental labor, and who devoted their lives to them. We want to educate the people to specifically understand the great significance of labor creating society and labor creating culture, thereby further inspiring the people to love the virtue of labor and to serve socialist construction. As for those antique hobbies that simply appreciate cultural relics, and the bad habits of monopolizing cultural relics, we must resolutely oppose and thoroughly eliminate them.

In the cultural relics cause, there is also currently a struggle between two lines: taking the socialist road and taking the semi-feudal and semi-colonial road. Moreover, this is an irreconcilable, extremely sharp and fierce struggle. We must adhere to the former and oppose the latter. Since liberation, ancient cultural relics have been owned by the public, and the cultural relics excavated underground completely belong to the people. Neither individual monopoly nor allowing individuals to use ancient cultural relics as a means of getting rich, let alone allowing imperialism to steal and transport them. Of course, taking such a road will be met with dissatisfaction by a small number of unscrupulous merchants and national scum who rely on selling ancient cultural relics to exchange for gold and US dollars. Zhang Naiqi is a typical example. He shouted about using cultural relics to exchange for foreign exchange, but in reality, he was simply seeking a way to get rich for himself. In addition, there are some people who hold serious localism and oppose the central government's scientific excavation and rational allocation of cultural relics (such as Chen Yuxin in Hunan); there are also some epigraphers and antique dealers who do not understand the Party's cultural relic policy, and they are dissatisfied with the Party. During the Party's rectification movement and the blooming and contending, the Zhang-Luo alliance saw this as an opportunity. Zhang Bojun found Ye Gongchuo to set fire in the cultural circles. For a time, many rightist elements used cultural relics work as a topic to launch a large-scale attack on the Party. They insisted that "During the land reform, the Communist Party burned ancient books like Qin Shi Huang" and "The Communist Party only destroys cultural relics and does not protect them," and so on.

In fact, revolutionary destruction is inevitable. Haven't you seen the blood shed by the martyrs in the revolutionary movement? After experiencing such a great revolutionary movement as land reform, how could there be no loss of ancient books and cultural relics! But how can it be said that there was only destruction and no protection? In the eight years since liberation, the central and local governments have done a lot of work to protect cultural relics. China is a large country with many cultural relics, and it is very difficult to protect them. Moreover, whether all antiquities are untouchable is also worth studying. For example, city walls exist almost everywhere in China, and even a small town often has a walled village. In addition to those that must be preserved and can be preserved, I think there are many city walls that do not need to be preserved. The idea that all antiquities are untouchable is a kind of feudal fetishism, an idolatrous thought. It should be seen that some cultural relics are difficult to preserve permanently. In addition to man-made destruction, nature will also gradually or suddenly destroy them. It must be admitted that there have been individual incidents of cultural relics destruction since liberation. In addition to revolutionary destruction, there is also a kind of ignorant destruction, neither of which can be blamed on the people, let alone on the Party. Song Yunbin exaggerated the incident of tearing down the tower in Longquan, as if all the cultural relics in the world had been destroyed by the Communist Party. This way of looking at the problem is illogical. The demolition of the tower in Longquan and the destruction of cultural relics is a regrettable and unfortunate event. But who should we hate for this? First of all, we should hate the rulers of the old era, their policy of fooling the people, which left the people without knowledge; secondly, we should hate ourselves for not doing a good job in publicizing the protection of cultural relics, and many people still do not know how to protect them.

Ye Gongchuo, Song Yunbin, and other rightist elements, standing on the position of the feudal comprador bourgeoisie, opposed the socialist cultural relics cause for the sake of their small group's private interests. They attempted to restore the cultural relics cause to the old road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. For the benefit of the masses of the people, we adhere to the correct direction of the cultural relics cause. We must carry out a life-and-death struggle with them. In the struggle, we must stand firm, draw a clear line, and not allow any ambiguity or tenderness. With the support of the national workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, a small number of ambitious elements are nothing more than "ants trying to shake a big tree, ridiculously overestimating themselves." Of course, the rightist elements stirring up trouble in the cultural relics circle is only a small aspect. Their overall purpose of setting fires everywhere is to oppose the Party's leadership, oppose the country's fundamental system, and attempt to seize the entire political power of the country. This is something we absolutely cannot allow. We should all actively participate in this struggle, stand firm, accept training, and strive to pass the great test of socialism.

    我们坚持文物事业的正确方向
    （1957年9月16日在文物界反右派分子座谈会上的发言纪录）
    郭沫若
    中国很早就有重视古文物的风气，研究古文物也有长远的历史；大致从汉朝起，人们就对出土的文物引起重视，有时封建皇帝获得一件古铜器，就改一次年号。在封建统治的时代，人们重视古文物，都把它当宝物，私藏垄断起来，作为古董供个人欣赏，成为一种古董趣味。这是一种坏风气。但也有好的一方面发展，那就是有人注意了对古文物的整理、研究。如许慎说文解字序：“郡国亦往往于山川得鼎彝，其铭即前代之古文，皆自相似。”古代大文字学家许慎很能利用古器物上的铭文作文字变迁的研究。西晋时在汲县魏襄王的墓里发现了大批竹简，当时即遭散失，但古代的学者们从剩余的竹简中，整理出来好几种战国典籍，其中就有著名的“竹书纪年”。到了北宋时代，研究金石器物，已成为系统的学问，有一段光辉的成就，如吕大临的“考古图”和“宣和博古图”，把古青铜器仔细地绘图、测量、考释铭文，有时联系到历史、地理。北宋以后，这门学问没有得到发展。直到清代，研究金石之学复盛，并有新的成就，如吴大澄、孙诒让、王国维，对这方面的研究有很好的成绩。但是在旧社会里，这种研究，总是受到时代的限制。
    近百年来，由于帝国主义的侵略，中国变成了半封建半殖民地的国家。随着帝国主义在政治、经济、文化的侵略，我国的文物也遭到他们蛮横的抢劫。英、美、德、日等帝国主义国家，都抢走了我国大量的珍贵文物。一方面由帝国主义分子直接动手来盗取，例如敦煌的壁画，有的已被他们剥走；大同云岗、洛阳龙门等处的许多佛像，遭到断头折臂的破坏、盗运；西安著名的石刻唐代昭陵六骏，被美帝偷运去二匹，还有四匹也已被打破成几段，准备偷运，被当地人民拦住，未及运走。
    还有我们国内的一些唯利是图的民族败类，他们勾结帝国主义分子，把大批文物卖给外国。如殷周青铜器，善本古书等等，其中有不少都卖给美国。美国的文化特务竟恬不知耻地说：“以后要研究中国学问的人，恐怕非到美国来不可了”。
    半封建半殖民地的中国，在帝国主义分子和民族败类的内外夹攻之下，祖国地上地下的珍贵文物，遭到了大规模的破坏，卖到外国的古文物，不可计量，真是空前未有的浩劫。
    历史上许多封建王朝也曾严重地破坏文物，封建统治者有时把出土的古物，视为不祥之物，大加毁损；如北周时曾将大批铜像器物毁废；有的王朝也因为排斥佛教的关系，破坏了许多寺院和佛像、碑幢。现在各地常有大批残破不全的佛像出土，就是证明。
    中国人民革命的胜利，使人民从长期被奴役的境遇中解放出来，人民把国家的事，看成自己的事，劳动热情，空前高涨，生产力得到了解放，这是一种比原子能还强大的力量。解放几年来，国家各种建设事业突飞猛进，例如长江大桥，原定1958年才能完工，今年就可通车了，并且还节约了经费三百万元。党在各方面的建设成绩，摆在我们面前，大家有目共见。文物事业在党的领导下，也取得了重大的成就。首先，党和政府颁布了一系列的文物保护法令，防止了珍贵文物人为的流失和破坏；其次，随着国家基本建设的发展，地下丰富的博物馆、文物仓库陆续被打开，出土文物，为数惊人。今年6月我去锡兰，往返都在昆明停留了一短时期，我在云南博物馆里，看到了大量的铜器，还有金器，有数千件之多，真是惊人。这些古物是晋宁石寨山滇王遗址中发掘出来的。有二个印章，一个是金质、蛇纽，印文是“滇王之印”，另一个是铜印，印文是“胜西印”，按文字形式看，是汉朝时候的遗物。还有铜鼓形状的铜器，在盖上焊铸有立体人物，表现出生动的生活情景，如战争、狩猎、祭祀等等，很像奴隶社会的风尚。从这些人物的形像、衣冠装束，以及器物的纹饰，还有兵器上的兽形等等，应该属于西南少数民族的文化。这仅仅是一个例子。在我国各地如长沙、西安、洛阳等等都有大量文物出土。
    出土的东西太多、太快，整理、研究的工作跟不上去，人手太少，这是个突出的问题，也是件非常遗憾的事。但是党和政府是十分重视这件工作的，几年来文化部文物管理局、科学院考古研究所、北京大学联合举办了四次训练班，大力培养考古工作人员。考古工作较之过去，已经焕然一新。就拿出版刊物来说，就有“考古学报”“考古通讯”“文物参考资料”等几种。中国有几千年的历史，地上地下文物之富，为世界各国所少见。现在应该赶快培植新生力量，扩大研究文物的队伍。老一辈的专家们，要加重负担培养人材，来应付燃眉之急的迫切任务。
    对于古文物我们不是为重视而重视，也不是为研究而研究，我们要坚持使古文物研究事业走社会主义的正确道路。我们的方针，是要用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点方法，来发掘、整理和研究古人给我们遗留下来的丰富的物质文化成品，使之彻底科学化。我们的目的，是要通过对文物的研究，利用，来发扬人民的爱国主义精神。我们要使人民明白：这是我们勤劳智慧的祖先，花了无数体力和脑力劳动，他们把毕生精力贯注在这上面，才创造出这些极为珍贵的文物。我们要教育人民从中去具体体会劳动创造社会，劳动创造文化的伟大意义，从而更加激发人民热爱劳动的美德，为社会主义建设服务。至于那些单纯赏玩文物的古董趣味，垄断文物的恶劣作风，我们要坚决反对，彻底肃清。
    在文物事业上，目前也存在着走社会主义道路和走半封建半殖民地道路的两条路线的斗争。而且这是势不两立、极为尖锐激烈的斗争，我们要坚持前者而反对后者。解放以来古文物已归公有，地下发掘出来的文物，已完全属于人民。既不容许个人垄断，也不容许个人把古文物作为发财致富的手段，更不容许帝国主义偷窃盗运。当然走这样一条道路，会为少数靠贩卖古文物来换取黄金、美钞的奸商、民族败类等所不满。章乃器就是典型，他高喊用文物来换取外汇，实际上无非在给自己求发财的路子。此外，还有一些人，他们抱着严重的地方主义思想，他们反对中央对文物的科学发掘与合理调拨（如湖南陈裕新）；也有一些不了解党的文物政策的金石家、古董商，他们都对党不满，在党整风运动大鸣大放期间，章罗联盟有见于此，认为有机可乘，章伯钧就找到叶恭绰出来在文化界放火。一时许多右派分子都曾借文物工作为题，大肆向党进攻。他们硬说：“土改中，共产党像秦始皇一样焚烧古书”“共产党对文物只有破坏，没有保护”等等。
    其实，革命的破坏是在所难免的。难道就没有看到在革命运动中烈士们所流的鲜血吗？经历一次像土地改革这样伟大的革命运动，古书文物那能没有一点损失！但何尝只有破坏没有保护呢？解放八年来，中央和地方都作了许多保护文物的工作。中国地方大，文物多，保护起来，很有困难。而且是否一切古物都碰不得，也值得研究。譬如城墙，在中国几乎到处都有，往往一个小市镇也有城寨。除了必须保存、可以保存者外，我看有很多城墙是可以不必保存的。凡是古物一律都动不得的思想，是一种封建的拜物狂，偶像崇拜的思想。应该看到还有些文物是难以永久保存的。除了人为的破坏以外，大自然也会逐渐地或突然地破坏它。必须承认，解放以来个别破坏文物的事件是有的，除了革命的破坏以外，还有一种是无知的破坏，都不能归罪于人民，更不能归罪于党。宋云彬把龙泉拆塔事件夸大起来，好像天下文物都被共产党破坏了，这样看问题是不合逻辑的。龙泉拆塔毁坏文物是一件可惜的，不幸的事。但对这件事我们应当憎恨谁呢？首先，我们应当憎恨旧时代的统治者，他们的愚民政策，使人民没有知识；其次，我们应当憎恨自己，没有作好爱护文物的宣传工作，很多人民还不知道去保护它们。
    叶恭绰、宋云彬等右派分子，他们站在封建买办资产阶级的立场上，为了他们一小撮人的私利，来反对社会主义的文物事业。企图把文物事业还原到半封建半殖民地的老路。为了人民大众的利益，我们坚持文物事业的正确方向。我们必须同他们展开你死我活的斗争。在斗争中，我们要站稳立场，划清界限，不容许有丝毫的含糊和温情。我们有全国工农群众和革命知识分子的支持，少数野心分子，只不过像“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”了。当然，右派分子在文物界兴风作浪，仅是一个小的方面。他们四处点火的总目的，在于反对党的领导，反对国家的根本制度，企图夺取国家的整个政权。这是我们绝不能容许的，我们大家应该积极投入这场斗争，站稳立场，接受锻炼，争取过好社会主义这一大关。
