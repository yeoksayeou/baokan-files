China has a long tradition of valuing ancient cultural relics, and the study of ancient cultural relics also has a long history. Roughly from the Han Dynasty onwards, people began to pay attention to unearthed cultural relics. Sometimes, when a feudal emperor obtained an ancient bronze artifact, he would change the reign title. In the era of feudal rule, people valued ancient cultural relics and treated them as treasures, hoarding and monopolizing them for personal appreciation, turning them into a kind of antique hobby. This was a bad trend. However, there was also a good aspect to its development, which was that some people paid attention to the organization and research of ancient cultural relics. For example, Xu Shen said in the preface to Shuowen Jiezi: "The commanderies and states often obtained tripods and Yi vessels from mountains and rivers, and their inscriptions were ancient texts from previous generations, all similar to each other." The great ancient philologist Xu Shen was very capable of using inscriptions on ancient artifacts to study the evolution of writing. In the Western Jin Dynasty, a large number of bamboo slips were discovered in the tomb of King Xiang of Wei in Jixian County. At that time, they were lost, but ancient scholars sorted out several Warring States classics from the remaining bamboo slips, including the famous "Bamboo Annals." By the Northern Song Dynasty, the study of bronze and stone artifacts had become a systematic field of study, with a period of brilliant achievements, such as LÃ¼ Daelin's "Archaeological Illustrations" and "Xuanhe Bogu Tu," which carefully illustrated ancient bronzes, measured them, and interpreted inscriptions, sometimes connecting them to history and geography. After the Northern Song Dynasty, this field of study did not develop. It was not until the Qing Dynasty that the study of epigraphy flourished again, with new achievements. Scholars such as Wu Dacheng, Sun Yirang, and Wang Guowei made excellent contributions to this field. However, in the old society, this kind of research was always limited by the times.

In the past hundred years, due to imperialist aggression, China became a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. Along with the political, economic, and cultural aggression of imperialism, our country's cultural relics were also subjected to their barbaric looting. Imperialist countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan all plundered a large number of China's precious cultural relics. On the one hand, imperialist elements directly stole them. For example, some of the murals in Dunhuang have been peeled off by them; many Buddha statues in Yungang in Datong, Longmen in Luoyang, and other places have been damaged, their heads cut off and arms broken, and transported away; the famous Tang Dynasty Zhaoling Six Steeds stone carvings in Xi'an were secretly transported away by the American imperialists, and the other four were also broken into several sections, ready to be smuggled away, but were stopped by the local people and did not make it out.

There were also some unprincipled national scum in our country who colluded with imperialist elements and sold a large number of cultural relics to foreign countries. Such as Yin and Zhou bronzes, rare ancient books, etc., many of which were sold to the United States. American cultural spies even shamelessly said: "Those who want to study Chinese learning in the future may have to come to the United States."

In semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, under the internal and external attacks of imperialist elements and national scum, the precious cultural relics above and below ground of the motherland suffered large-scale destruction. The number of ancient cultural relics sold to foreign countries was immeasurable. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe.

Many feudal dynasties in history also seriously damaged cultural relics. Feudal rulers sometimes regarded unearthed antiquities as ominous objects and greatly destroyed them. For example, the Northern Zhou Dynasty destroyed a large number of bronze statues and artifacts; some dynasties also destroyed many temples and Buddha statues and steles because of their rejection of Buddhism. The large number of fragmented Buddha statues unearthed in various places now is proof of this.

The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution liberated the people from long-term enslavement. The people regarded the affairs of the country as their own, and their labor enthusiasm soared to unprecedented heights. The productive forces were liberated, which is a force even more powerful than atomic energy. In the few years since liberation, the country's various construction undertakings have advanced by leaps and bounds. For example, the Yangtze River Bridge was originally scheduled to be completed in 1958, but it will be open to traffic this year, and it has also saved 3 million yuan in funding. The Party's achievements in various aspects of construction are there for all to see. Under the leadership of the Party, the cultural relics cause has also made significant achievements. First, the Party and the government promulgated a series of cultural relic protection laws to prevent the artificial loss and destruction of precious cultural relics; second, with the development of the country's basic construction, the rich underground museums and cultural relic warehouses were opened one after another, and the number of unearthed cultural relics was astonishing. In June of this year, when I went to Ceylon, I stopped in Kunming for a short period of time on the way back and forth. In the Yunnan Museum, I saw a large number of bronzes and gold artifacts, numbering in the thousands. It was truly amazing. These antiquities were excavated from the Dian King site in Shizhaishan, Jinning. There were two seals, one gold, with a snake knob, and the seal text was "Seal of the Dian King," and the other was a copper seal with the seal text "Seal of Shengxi." Judging from the form of the writing, they were relics from the Han Dynasty. There were also bronze drums, with three-dimensional figures welded onto the lid, depicting vivid scenes of life, such as wars, hunting, sacrifices, etc., very much like the customs of a slave society. From the images of these figures, their clothing, and the patterns on the artifacts, as well as the animal shapes on the weapons, they should belong to the culture of the southwestern ethnic minorities. This is just one example. In various parts of China, such as Changsha, Xi'an, Luoyang, etc., a large number of cultural relics have been unearthed.

Too many things are being unearthed too quickly, and the work of organizing and researching cannot keep up. There are too few people. This is a prominent problem, and it is also a very regrettable thing. However, the Party and the government attach great importance to this work. In the past few years, the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, the Archaeological Institute of the Academy of Sciences, and Peking University have jointly held four training classes to vigorously train archaeological workers. Archaeological work has been completely renewed compared to the past. Taking publications as an example, there are several such as "Archaeological Journal," "Archaeological Newsletter," and "Cultural Relics Reference Materials." China has thousands of years of history, and the richness of cultural relics above and below ground is rarely seen in other countries. Now, we should quickly cultivate new forces and expand the ranks of cultural relics research. The older generation of experts must increase their burden of cultivating talent to cope with the urgent task at hand.

We do not value ancient cultural relics for the sake of valuing them, nor do we study them for the sake of studying them. We must adhere to the correct socialist path in the ancient cultural relics research cause. Our policy is to use the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to excavate, organize, and study the rich material cultural products left to us by the ancients, and to thoroughly scientize them. Our purpose is to use the research and utilization of cultural relics to promote the patriotic spirit of the people. We want to make the people understand: These extremely precious cultural relics were created by our hardworking and intelligent ancestors, who spent countless physical and mental labor, and who devoted their lives to them. We want to educate the people to specifically understand the great significance of labor creating society and labor creating culture, thereby further inspiring the people to love the virtue of labor and to serve socialist construction. As for those antique hobbies that simply appreciate cultural relics, and the bad habits of monopolizing cultural relics, we must resolutely oppose and thoroughly eliminate them.

In the cultural relics cause, there is also currently a struggle between two lines: taking the socialist road and taking the semi-feudal and semi-colonial road. Moreover, this is an irreconcilable, extremely sharp and fierce struggle. We must adhere to the former and oppose the latter. Since liberation, ancient cultural relics have been owned by the public, and the cultural relics excavated underground completely belong to the people. Neither individual monopoly nor allowing individuals to use ancient cultural relics as a means of getting rich, let alone allowing imperialism to steal and transport them. Of course, taking such a road will be met with dissatisfaction by a small number of unscrupulous merchants and national scum who rely on selling ancient cultural relics to exchange for gold and US dollars. Zhang Naiqi is a typical example. He shouted about using cultural relics to exchange for foreign exchange, but in reality, he was simply seeking a way to get rich for himself. In addition, there are some people who hold serious localism and oppose the central government's scientific excavation and rational allocation of cultural relics (such as Chen Yuxin in Hunan); there are also some epigraphers and antique dealers who do not understand the Party's cultural relic policy, and they are dissatisfied with the Party. During the Party's rectification movement and the blooming and contending, the Zhang-Luo alliance saw this as an opportunity. Zhang Bojun found Ye Gongchuo to set fire in the cultural circles. For a time, many rightist elements used cultural relics work as a topic to launch a large-scale attack on the Party. They insisted that "During the land reform, the Communist Party burned ancient books like Qin Shi Huang" and "The Communist Party only destroys cultural relics and does not protect them," and so on.

In fact, revolutionary destruction is inevitable. Haven't you seen the blood shed by the martyrs in the revolutionary movement? After experiencing such a great revolutionary movement as land reform, how could there be no loss of ancient books and cultural relics! But how can it be said that there was only destruction and no protection? In the eight years since liberation, the central and local governments have done a lot of work to protect cultural relics. China is a large country with many cultural relics, and it is very difficult to protect them. Moreover, whether all antiquities are untouchable is also worth studying. For example, city walls exist almost everywhere in China, and even a small town often has a walled village. In addition to those that must be preserved and can be preserved, I think there are many city walls that do not need to be preserved. The idea that all antiquities are untouchable is a kind of feudal fetishism, an idolatrous thought. It should be seen that some cultural relics are difficult to preserve permanently. In addition to man-made destruction, nature will also gradually or suddenly destroy them. It must be admitted that there have been individual incidents of cultural relics destruction since liberation. In addition to revolutionary destruction, there is also a kind of ignorant destruction, neither of which can be blamed on the people, let alone on the Party. Song Yunbin exaggerated the incident of tearing down the tower in Longquan, as if all the cultural relics in the world had been destroyed by the Communist Party. This way of looking at the problem is illogical. The demolition of the tower in Longquan and the destruction of cultural relics is a regrettable and unfortunate event. But who should we hate for this? First of all, we should hate the rulers of the old era, their policy of fooling the people, which left the people without knowledge; secondly, we should hate ourselves for not doing a good job in publicizing the protection of cultural relics, and many people still do not know how to protect them.

Ye Gongchuo, Song Yunbin, and other rightist elements, standing on the position of the feudal comprador bourgeoisie, opposed the socialist cultural relics cause for the sake of their small group's private interests. They attempted to restore the cultural relics cause to the old road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. For the benefit of the masses of the people, we adhere to the correct direction of the cultural relics cause. We must carry out a life-and-death struggle with them. In the struggle, we must stand firm, draw a clear line, and not allow any ambiguity or tenderness. With the support of the national workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, a small number of ambitious elements are nothing more than "ants trying to shake a big tree, ridiculously overestimating themselves." Of course, the rightist elements stirring up trouble in the cultural relics circle is only a small aspect. Their overall purpose of setting fires everywhere is to oppose the Party's leadership, oppose the country's fundamental system, and attempt to seize the entire political power of the country. This is something we absolutely cannot allow. We should all actively participate in this struggle, stand firm, accept training, and strive to pass the great test of socialism.
