Development of Women and Children's Health Work
Speech by Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, at the Women's Congress

　　I fully agree with Comrade Zhang Yun's work report.

　　Now I will talk about the development of women and children's health work in the country.

　　Since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Party and the government and the strong support of mass organizations, especially the assistance of women's federations at all levels, China's women and children's health undertakings have achieved great achievements. However, bourgeois rightists have ulterior motives in spreading rumors and slandering that the health work has not been done well and that the achievements of women and children's health work are not great, in order to launch a vicious attack on the Party. Now I will give a brief report to the representatives on some situations of women and children's health work.

　　Everyone knows that the Kuomintang ruled China for more than 20 years and did not pay attention to women and children's health work at all. There were only more than 90 midwifery schools in the country, but the quality was very poor, and a total of more than 13,900 midwives were trained; there was no women and children's health administrative organization, and no one was in charge of the work. Therefore, the vast number of women and infants were oppressed by the feudal system and suffered from serious threats of death and disease.

　　After liberation, women and children's health work was listed as a major part of the people's health care cause, and it was clearly focused on developing new midwifery methods and launching a struggle against puerperal fever and neonatal tetanus. By the end of 1956, a total of more than 578,000 birth attendants had been trained and old midwives transformed. The active promotion of new midwifery methods has greatly reduced the incidence of puerperal fever in mothers and tetanus in infants. Before liberation, the annual maternal mortality rate was about 15‰, and the infant mortality rate was about 200‰; in 1956, the infant mortality rate was 77.3‰, a decrease of 122.7‰ compared with before liberation. The maternal mortality rate has been significantly reduced. According to Beijing's statistics, the infant mortality rate was 117.6‰ in 1949 and decreased to 35.1‰ in 1956; the neonatal tetanus mortality rate was 7.2‰ in 1949 and decreased to 0.17‰ in 1956. In 1956, no maternal in Beijing died of puerperal fever. Since the implementation of new midwifery methods, neonatal tetanus has been basically eliminated in large and medium-sized cities, and neonatal tetanus has also been basically controlled in rural areas. At present, the new midwifery method has reached more than 95% in large cities and an average of 40% in rural areas. The facts show that the infant mortality rate is decreasing year by year, and the level of women and children's health is improving year by year.

　　With the progress of industrial construction, women and children's health care work has been carried out among female workers and their families in factories and mines. Especially in textile factories, where the number of female workers is the largest, there must be women and children's health care measures to improve production quality. Now many workshops have improved the working environment and safety facilities; female workers' health rooms and menstrual card registration systems have been established; the health rooms have special personnel in charge. Because female workers' menstruation can be accurately grasped, pregnant women and gynecological diseases can be detected early, and pregnancy observation and early treatment of diseases can be carried out in time. Larger factories have also opened canteens and rest rooms specifically for pregnant women. In order to prevent female workers from having miscarriages, in addition to conducting health knowledge publicity work, the workload of pregnant women is reduced in certain work links. At present, large and medium-sized factories across the country can guarantee that female workers use new midwifery methods, and the number of hospital deliveries is gradually increasing. For example, the textile systems in Shanghai and Qingdao have their own maternity hospitals. In many relatively remote industrial and mining areas, family committees are organized in family areas to train birth attendants to solve the delivery problems of family members.

　　In the past old society, female workers were not welcome in factories after they got married, and they might be fired after pregnancy. There was no care during pregnancy and after childbirth. Now female workers have begun to receive appropriate care during menstruation; pregnant female workers are given regular pregnancy examinations. After seven months of pregnancy, with a doctor's certificate, they can have rest during work hours and can be transferred to lighter work. The maternity leave is 56 days, and after work, the children can be placed in nurseries or breastfeeding rooms, and there is a specified breastfeeding time every day without deducting wages. Because the health of female workers and the sanitary conditions of workers' families have been improved, it has directly or indirectly guaranteed industrial production.

　　Agricultural cooperation has created favorable conditions for promoting women and children's health care work. There are training and organization of birth attendants, health workers, and childcare workers in the community, who serve the members exclusively. Appropriate care is given to women during menstruation and pregnancy, such as not going into the water during menstruation, changing to lighter work during pregnancy, and adjusting the location of work for lactating mothers to nearby areas. In order to further improve the quality of new midwifery methods and improve the attendance rate of farmers in production, rural maternity hospitals have also been set up in Hebei, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other places, so that female farmers can be hospitalized for delivery. Rural birth attendants are widely distributed. They travel day and night, regardless of wind, rain, cold and heat, to all corners of the countryside, serving exclusively for mothers and newborns. In the past few years, many model figures have emerged. For example, Zhang Qiu'e from Nanzhao Village, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, created a set of working methods for training, improving, organizing and educating birth attendants, setting up banners and creating typical examples among the masses, and reversing the past erroneous view that people despised midwifery work.

　　In ethnic minority areas, women and children's health work has also been greatly developed in the past few years. The characteristics of these areas before liberation were many venereal diseases, lack of health knowledge, low birth rate, high mortality rate, and declining population year by year. After liberation, women and children's health was first combined with the work of eradicating venereal diseases, and ethnic birth attendants were vigorously trained; fixed delivery locations were established; pregnant herders moved their tents to live near women and children's health stations to wait for labor; and it was also advocated that pregnant women should not go to "Aotere" (that is, not nomadic) to reduce the occurrence of abortion. At the same time, pilot work on new childcare methods was carried out, such as helping them make small clothes, adding supplementary food, and keeping warm in tents, which effectively reduced the occurrence of infant diarrhea and pneumonia, and is now ready to be promoted. In the past, the tragic scene of "only seeing mothers pregnant with children, but not seeing children walking" has been completely eliminated for many years. Obviously, due to the vigorous development of venereal disease eradication work and women and children's health work, the fertility rate of women in ethnic minority areas has gradually increased, and the population has also increased significantly.

　　With the development of China's socialist construction, the people's living standards and living knowledge levels continue to improve, reducing the people's morbidity and mortality, and the population is growing rapidly. China's industrial and agricultural production has overfulfilled the first five-year plan, and the people's lives have been initially improved. However, the people's material and cultural life cannot be satisfied to the greatest extent. If they have too many or too closely spaced children, it will inevitably affect the health of mothers and children, affect the work and study of parents, and the education of their children. Therefore, appropriately controlling births and advocating planned childbearing is suitable for China's current situation and the needs of the vast people.

　　In 1956, Premier Zhou said at the "Eighth National Congress": "In order to protect women and children, educate the next generation well, and benefit the health and prosperity of the nation, we agree to appropriately control births. The health department should cooperate with relevant parties to conduct appropriate publicity on the issue of contraception and take effective measures." In order to further meet the needs of the people for contraception, in 1956 it was decided to set up contraception clinics in various medical and health departments to provide the masses with contraceptive technical guidance and publicity of contraceptive knowledge; and to strengthen the supply of contraceptive appliances and medicines by pharmaceutical companies; the Chinese Medical Association established a Contraceptive Technical Guidance Committee to strengthen contraceptive technical guidance and research, and pay attention to the exchange of experiences from various places.

　　Due to the vigorous development of scientific knowledge publicity work on new childcare methods in the past few years, the prevention of diseases that are most harmful to infant health, especially acute infectious diseases such as measles, diarrhea, colds, pneumonia, and scarlet fever, has been strengthened. The number of BCG vaccinations is increasing year by year. In large cities such as Beijing, half of the children can receive BCG vaccination. According to statistics in recent years, the mortality rate of measles and scarlet fever has decreased year by year.

　　Childcare is an important measure of socialist countries. It not only liberates women's labor force, but more importantly, it enables the new generation to receive reasonable education. Since liberation, China's childcare has developed rapidly. Before liberation, there were only 126 nurseries in the country. By the end of 1956, there were more than 26,700 various childcare institutions in cities across the country, accommodating more than 1.25 million children, an increase of 260 times compared with 1949. There are now 634,640 seasonal nurseries, accommodating 6,106,272 children, which has played a great role in ensuring rural women's labor and children's safety. Now nurseries have generally established reasonable daily schedules and health care systems. Before liberation, there were only 81 women and children's health care hospitals (including maternity hospitals), with only 1,736 beds; there were only 3 children's hospitals, with only 173 beds. In 1956, there were 12 children's hospitals, and the number of beds increased to 1,644. For example, there was no such facility as a delivery station before liberation. In 1956, there were 79,500 delivery stations in the country. Pediatricians, children's nurses, and childcare workers are now being actively trained. By 1956, 3,769 obstetricians and gynecologists, 3,769 pediatricians, more than 34,000 midwives, more than 44,000 women and children's health workers, more than 578,000 birth attendants, and more than 356,000 childcare workers had been trained and educated. In order to improve the scientific nature of pediatric health care, a children's health research institute is now being planned.

　　The above figures show that the women and children's health work in the past few years since liberation has developed significantly compared with before liberation, whether in the establishment of institutions or in the training of personnel. Here, I would also like to report on the situation of our women on the health front: there are 1.89 million health technicians in the country, of which more than 850,000 are female health cadres, accounting for 45% of the total number, of which 1.39% are senior, 15.82% are intermediate, 82.3% are junior, and 0.07% are Chinese medicine. There are also currently 46,128 students in senior medical colleges, of which more than 40% are female students and 25% are from worker and peasant families. This is enough to show how powerful our female cadres are! This team is sticking to their posts day and night, directly cooperating and completing the great historical task of the motherland's socialist construction.

　　Comrades, we do not deny that there are shortcomings in the development of the work, but the fact before us is: the achievements of women and children's health work are huge, and we will never allow bourgeois rightists to slander and obliterate our work achievements.

专栏：

　　妇幼卫生工作发展情况
　　全国妇联副主席李德全在妇代会上的发言
    我完全同意章蕴同志所作的工作报告。
    我现在谈谈全国妇幼卫生工作的发展情况。
    建国以来，我国妇幼卫生事业在党和政府的领导下及群众团体的大力支持，特别是全国各级妇联的协助，取得了伟大的成绩。可是资产阶级右派分子却别有用心的造谣和诬蔑说卫生工作做得不好，妇幼卫生工作成绩不大，借以向党进行恶毒的进攻。现在我就妇幼卫生工作的一些情况，向诸位代表作简要的报告。
    大家都晓得，国民党统治中国二十几年，根本就不重视妇幼卫生工作。全国仅有九十余所助产学校，但质量很差，共训练助产士13，900余名；没有妇幼卫生行政组织，工作无人领导，因而广大的妇女和婴儿在封建制度压迫下并遭受着严重的死亡和疾病的威胁。
    解放以后，妇幼卫生工作列为人民保健事业的一项主要的内容，并明确以开展新法接生为主，展开对产褥热、新生儿破伤风的斗争。到1956年底全国共训练接生员和改造旧产婆已达57万8千余名。积极推广新法接生，从而大大减少了产妇产褥热和婴儿破伤风的发病率。解放前每年产妇死亡率为15‰左右，婴儿死亡率为200‰左右；1956年婴儿死亡率为77.3‰，较解放前下降122.7‰。产妇死亡率更有显著的降低。据北京市的统计，婴儿死亡率1949年为117.6‰，1956年降低为35.1‰；新生儿破伤风死亡率1949年为7.2‰，1956年降低到0.17‰。1956年北京市没有一个产妇死于产褥热的。自从实行新法接生之后，大中城市的新生儿破伤风已基本上消灭，在农村新生儿破伤风也基本上得到控制。目前大城市新法接生已达95％以上，农村平均为40％。事实说明，婴儿死亡率是逐年下降，妇幼卫生水平是在逐年提高。
    随着工业建设的进展，在厂矿女职工和家属中开展了妇幼保健工作。尤其纺织工厂，女工人数最多，必须有妇幼保健措施来提高生产质量，现在很多车间已改进作业环境和安全设施；都建立了女工卫生室和月经卡片登记制度；卫生室有专人负责。由于女工们的月经能正确掌握，可以及早发现孕妇、妇科病，并及时进行孕期观察和早期治疗疾病。有较大工厂还专为孕妇开辟食堂和休息室。为了防止女工流产，除了进行卫生知识宣传工作，并在某种工作环节上减少孕妇的负荷量。目前全国大、中型工厂，已能保证女工采用新法接生，住院分娩数也逐渐增加，如上海、青岛纺织系统均自设产院，许多比较偏僻的工矿地区，在家属区组织家属委员会，训练接生员解决家属的接生问题。
    在过去旧社会女工结了婚，就不受工厂欢迎，怀孕后就有被开除的可能，怀孕期间和产后根本谈不上照顾；现在女工在月经期内也已开始得到适当照顾；对怀孕的女工按时进行孕期检查，孕期满七个月，经医师证明，可以有工间休息，并可调换轻工作。产期有产假56天，上班后可以把孩子放在托儿所或哺乳室，每天规定有哺乳时间，不扣工资。由于女工的健康和职工家属卫生条件有所改进，对工业生产直接或间接的起了保证作用。
    农业合作化为推动妇幼保健工作创造了有利条件，社内有接生员、保健员和保育员的训练和组织，专为社员服务。对妇女行经和孕期有适当照顾，如经期不下水，孕期调换轻工作，乳母调近地工作等。为进一步提高新法接生质量与提高农民生产出勤率，河北、陕西、浙江、上海等地还设有农村产院，使女农民能住院分娩。农村接生员分布很广，她们不分昼夜，不怕风雨寒暑，奔驰在农村各个角落，专为产妇和新生儿服务，几年来也涌现了不少模范人物。例如山西万荣县南赵村张秋娥，她自己创造了一套训练、提高、组织和教育接生员的工作方法，在群众中树立旗帜，创造典型，扭转了过去人们轻视接生工作的错误看法。
    在少数民族地区，几年来妇幼卫生工作也有很大的开展。这些地区在解放前的特点是性病多，卫生知识缺乏，出生率低，死亡率高，人口逐年下降。解放以后，首先结合了驱梅工作开展了妇幼卫生，大力训练民族接生员；固定接生地点；牧民在孕期，把帐篷搬到妇幼保健站附近居住，等待临产；又提倡孕妇不走“敖特尔”（即不游牧），以减少流产的发生。同时还进行了新法育儿的试点工作，如帮助他们做小衣服，加副食，帐篷内保温等办法，有效地降低了婴儿腹泻和肺炎的发生，现在准备推广。过去，多年来流传着“只见娘怀儿，不见儿走路”的悲惨景象已根本消除了。很显然，由于驱梅工作及妇幼卫生工作的大力开展，少数民族地区的妇女生育率逐渐提高，人口也显著上升了。
    随着我国社会主义建设事业的发展，人民生活和生活知识水平不断提高，减少了人民的发病和死亡，人口增长的速度很快。我国工农业生产已超额完成第一个五年计划，人民生活获得初步改善。但人民的物质文化生活还不能得到最大的满足，如果生育子女过多过密，势必影响母子健康，影响父母的工作、学习以及对子女的教养。因此，适当节制生育，提倡有计划地生育子女是适合我国当前情况和广大人民要求的。
    1956年周总理在“八大”曾讲到：“为了保护妇女和儿童，很好地教养后代，以利民族的健康和繁荣，我们赞成在生育方面加以适当的节制。卫生部门应该协同有关方面对于节育问题进行适当的宣传并且采取有效的措施。”为了进一步满足人民群众对节育的需要，1956年决定在各医疗保健部门设立避孕门诊，向群众进行避孕技术指导和宣传避孕知识；并加强医药公司的避孕用具和药品的供应工作；中华医学会成立节育技术指导委员会，以加强节育技术指导和研究工作，并注意交流各地经验。
    由于几年来大力开展了新法育儿的科学知识宣传工作，加强了对危害婴儿健康最大的疾病，特别如麻疹、腹泻、感冒、肺炎、猩红热等急性传染病的预防。卡介苗注射数逐年在增加，大城市中如北京已有半数儿童能得到卡介苗预防注射。据几年来统计，麻疹、猩红热的死亡率逐年下降。
    托儿事业是社会主义国家一项重要措施，它不但解放了妇女劳动力，更重要的是使新生一代得到合理的教养。解放以来，我国托儿事业有了很快发展，解放前全国仅有托儿所126所，1956年底全国城市有各种托儿机构26，700余处，收托儿童125万余名，比1949年增加260倍。农忙托儿所已达634，640个，受托儿童6，106，272人，对保障农村妇女劳动和儿童安全起了很大作用，现在托儿所都普遍建立合理的生活日程和保健制度。妇幼保健院（包括产院）在解放前只有81个，床位只有1736张；儿童医院只有3个，床位只有173张。而在1956年儿童医院已有12个，床位增加到1644张。又如接生站在解放前根本没有这种设施，1956年全国已经有了接生站79500个。儿科医师和儿童护士、保育员现正在不断地积极培养中。到1956年为止，已培养、训练、教育了妇产科医生3769人，儿科医师3769人，助产士34000多人，妇幼保健员44000多人，接生员578000多人，保育员356000多人。为了提高儿科保健的科学性，现已筹设儿童保健研究所。
    从以上数字说明，解放几年来的妇幼卫生工作，无论在机构的建立上，无论在人员的培养上都比解放以前有了显著的发展。在这里我还把我们妇女在卫生战线上的情况报告一下：全国卫生技术人员共有189万人，其中妇女卫生干部有85万多人，占总人数的45％，其中高级的占1.39％，中级占15.82％，初级占82.3％，中医占0.07％。还有目前在高级医学院校的学生数为46，128名，其中女生即占40％以上，工农子弟占25％，这足可以看出来我们妇女干部是一支多么强大的队伍！这一支队伍是在日以继夜的坚持着工作岗位，直接配合与完成着祖国社会主义的建设的伟大历史任务。
    同志们，我们不否认在工作的开展中有缺点，但是摆在我们面前的事实是：妇幼卫生工作获得成绩是巨大的，我们决不容许资产阶级右派分子对我们工作成绩的污蔑和抹杀。
