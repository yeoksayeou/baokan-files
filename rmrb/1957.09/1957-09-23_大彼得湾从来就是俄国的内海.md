Title: Peter the Great Bay Has Always Been a Russian Inland Sea

The British Foreign Office announced on the 17th that on September 10th, it had lodged a "formal protest" regarding the Soviet Union's announcement on July 21st that the Peter the Great Bay area outside Vladivostok was designated as a Soviet inland sea, prohibiting the free navigation of foreign ships and aircraft. Prior to this, Japan and the United States had also lodged similar "protests" with the Soviet Union. In their "protest" notes, they falsely accused the Soviet Union of designating Peter the Great Bay as an inland sea, which was a "violation of international law" and "violated the generally recognized principle of freedom of the high seas." The U.S. government's note even more arrogantly slandered the Soviet government for "attempting to illegally seize a large area of the high seas through unilateral action." The "protests" lodged by the governments of the United States, Britain, and Japan are attempts to deny historical facts and the legitimate rights of a sovereign state by playing with the terms of international law, and are therefore completely unreasonable.

According to the general concept of international law, there are two types of bays that can be considered inland seas by coastal states: one is a bay surrounded by the territory of the same coastal state, and the width of its entrance to the sea (i.e., the bay mouth) does not exceed a certain limit; the other is a bay whose mouth has no fixed limit based on historical reasons or the special nature of the bay.

Regarding the width of the entrance of the first type of bay, there is no clear stipulation in international law. Initially, it was believed that the width of the entrance to the sea should not exceed six nautical miles, and later some people advocated expanding it to ten nautical miles. The plan proposed by the United Nations International Law Commission in 1955 advocated expanding the width to twenty-five nautical miles, but when the committee re-discussed the issue in 1956, it proposed a new plan limiting it to fifteen nautical miles. It is clear that the issue of the width of the bay mouth has not yet reached a consensus, but the trend of gradually expanding the width of the bay is very obvious. Therefore, the "protests" lodged by the governments of the United States, Britain, and Japan to the Soviet government based on the grounds that the territorial sea of ​​the bay is twice the general territorial sea (i.e., six nautical miles) are completely unfounded.

The second type of bay, namely historical bays, refers to bays that have long-term important economic or other interests to a coastal state, and that this coastal state has continuously maintained control over the bay for a long time. For this type of bay, regardless of how wide its mouth is, the coastal state has the right to declare it as an inland sea. This type of bay is not only recognized by international law and international practice, and recognized by the United Nations International Law Commission in the aforementioned two meetings discussing bay issues, but also exists in many cases in fact. For example, France claims Cancale Bay, which has an entrance width of 17 nautical miles, as an inland sea; Norway claims Varangerfjord, which has an entrance width of 32 nautical miles, as an inland sea; Canada claims Hudson Bay, which has an entrance width of 50 nautical miles, as an inland sea. And the United Kingdom and the United States, which protested to the Soviet government this time, also claim to have such bays, such as the Firth of Forth in the United Kingdom, which is 74.5 nautical miles wide, Bristol Bay, which is 100 nautical miles wide, and Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay in the United States, which are also 12 and 10 nautical miles wide respectively. These facts are sufficient to prove that the width of this historical bay far exceeds the width of a general bay considered as an inland sea. The Soviet government's announcement on July 21 of the inland sea boundaries of the Peter the Great Bay area fully meets the conditions of the aforementioned historical bay. Therefore, the "protests" from the governments of the United States, Britain, and Japan are completely unfounded.

Peter the Great Bay has always been a Russian historical bay. It has a particularly important significance for the Soviet Union both economically and defensively. The Tsarist government had also declared Peter the Great Bay as a Russian inland sea in 1901. The Soviet government's communiqué on July 21 regarding the inland sea boundaries of Peter the Great Bay was merely reiterating this historical fact and reminding other countries to pay attention to the Soviet Union's historical rights in the area. All these facts and grounds are very clear to other countries. The reason why the United States, Britain, and Japan want to lodge unfounded "protests" is nothing more than an attempt to confuse international opinion, prepare conditions for them to infringe upon Soviet sovereignty, interfere in the Soviet inland sea, and create international disputes.

The Chinese government and people fully support the Soviet government's reaffirmation of Peter the Great Bay as a Soviet inland sea, and believe that this is a legitimate action by the Soviet government to safeguard its inviolable territorial sea sovereignty and fully complies with international law and international practice. No country has the right to interfere. Countless facts prove that it is not the Soviet Union that is truly violating international law and infringing upon the freedom of the high seas, but precisely the Western countries such as the United States and Britain. For example, the continuous testing of nuclear weapons with severely harmful radioactive effects by the United Kingdom and the United States on the high seas has aroused serious protests from peace-loving people all over the world. Furthermore, the hijacking of merchant ships and oil tankers of various countries by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique on the high seas, as well as the intrusion of American planes and balloons into the airspace of the Soviet Union and other countries, are direct violations of international law. We believe that the "protests" from the governments of the United States, Britain, and Japan, which slander the Soviet Union, will not only fail to deceive world opinion, but will instead be despised by peace-loving people all over the world, because justice is entirely on the side of the Soviet Union.

### 大彼得湾从来就是俄国的内海

    大彼得湾从来就是俄国的内海
    英国外交部17日宣布：英国在9月10日就苏联7月21日宣布在海参崴外面的大彼得湾区域为苏联内海界限，禁止外国船只和外国飞机自由航行和飞行事提出
  “正式抗议”。在这以前，日本和美国也曾为此事先后向苏联提出过类似的“抗议”。它们在“抗议”照会中诬蔑苏联把大彼得湾作为内海是“违反国际法”和“违反公认的公海自由的原则”。美国政府的照会更狂妄地诬蔑苏联政府“企图以片面行动非法侵占一大片公海”。美、英、日三国政府所提出的“抗议”是企图以玩弄国际法的名词来否定历史事实和一个主权国家的合法权利，因而是毫无道理的。
    按照国际法的一般概念，有两种海湾可以被沿岸国家认为是内海：一种是由同一沿岸国家的领土所包围，而且它的通海的入口（即湾口）宽度不超过一定限度的海湾；另一种是基于历史上的理由或基于海湾特殊性质的理由，其湾口并无一定限度的海湾。
    关于第一种海湾的宽度，国际法上并没有明确的规定，最初认为通海入口的宽度不超过六海里，以后又有人主张扩大到十海里。1955年联合国国际法委员会提出的方案主张把宽度扩大到二十五海里，但是1956年该委员会重新讨论这个问题的时候，又提出仍以十五海里为限的新方案。由此可见，海湾湾口的宽度问题还没有得到公认的看法，但是，海湾宽度逐渐扩大的趋势是很明显的。因此，英、美、日三国政府以海湾的领海为一般领海的两倍（即六海里）为理由来向苏联政府提出“抗议”，是完全没有根据的。
    关于第二种海湾，即历史性的海湾，是指对某一个沿岸国家在长期以来具有重要的经济上或其他利益的关系、而长期以来这一沿岸国家又对海湾不断掌握控制权的那种海湾。对这种海湾，不论其湾口多宽，沿岸国政府都有权宣布为内海。这种海湾不仅为国际法和国际惯例所公认，为联合国国际法委员会在前述两次讨论海湾问题的会议所承认，而且事实上也存在着很多这种海湾。例如：法国主张把入口宽度为十七海里的堪卡尔湾作为内海；挪威主张把入口宽度为三十二海里瓦伦格尔湾作为内海；加拿大主张把入口宽度为五十海里的哈得逊湾作为内海。而这次向苏联政府提出“抗议”的英、美两国也同样主张有这种海湾，如英国的福耳斯湾，有七十四点五海里宽，布里斯他湾有一百海里宽，美国的辙塞比克湾和德拉威尔湾也都有十二海里和十海里宽。这些事实足以证明：这种历史性的海湾的宽度，是远远超过一般作为内海海湾的宽度的。苏联政府7月21日宣布的大彼得湾区域的内海界限，是完全符合上述历史性海湾的条件。因此，英、美、日三国政府的“抗议”是完全没有根据的。
    大彼得湾从来就是俄国的历史性海湾。不论在经济上和国防上，它对苏联都具有特别重要的意义。沙皇政府在1901年也曾宣布过大彼得湾是俄国的内海。苏联政府7月21日发表关于大彼得湾的内海界限的公报，不过是重申这个历史事实，并提醒其他国家注意到苏联在该地区的历史性的权利而已。所有这些事实和根据，其他国家都是很清楚的。美、英、日三国所以要提出毫无根据的“抗议”，其目的无非是妄图混淆国际视听，为他们侵犯苏联主权、染指苏联内海和制造国际纠纷准备条件。
    中国政府和人民完全支持苏联政府重申把大彼得湾作为苏联的内海，并且认为这是苏联政府为维护自己的不可侵犯的领海主权并完全符合国际法和国际惯例的正当行动。任何国家都无权加以干涉。无数事实证明：真正违反国际法和侵犯公海自由的，并不是苏联，而恰恰是美英等西方国家。例如英、美两国不断在公海上试验能够发生严重危害的放射性作用的核武器，已经引起全世界爱好和平人民的严重抗议。而美蒋在公海上劫持各国商船、油船以及美国飞机、气球的侵入苏联和其他国家的领空，更是对国际法的直接破坏。我们相信：英、美、日三国政府诬蔑苏联的“抗议”不但不能欺骗世界舆论，相反地将受到全世界爱好和平人民的蔑视，因为正义完全在苏联方面。
