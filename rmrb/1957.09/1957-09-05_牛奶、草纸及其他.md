Milk, Toilet Paper, and Other Matters
By our reporter Ji Yin

At the recently concluded Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, the people of Shanghai engaged in a face-to-face great debate with the right-wing elements. Our newspaper has already reported on the course of the debate and several victorious battles. What is written here are merely some fragments from this meeting.

Milk and Toilet Paper

"You manage too much, you manage too rigidly!" This was one of the most frequent criticisms the right-wing elements leveled against the Party a few months ago. Shen Zhiyuan, the leading rightist in Shanghai, shouted the loudest, saying at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Conference: "Now even milk and toilet paper issues must be managed. If this continues, will we have to go to the government when we have a stomach ache or can't sleep at night?"

Shen Zhiyuan was using milk and toilet paper as an excuse to attack the socialist planned economy and the socialist system. However, people may as well address the issue directly and reason with the right-wing gentlemen.

Should the state manage milk and toilet paper? Has the management been bad or good? Eight representatives, including Guo Jian, made speeches specifically on this issue, providing many convincing materials. They said: Milk is no longer the nutritional food enjoyed by a few before liberation. In recent years, milk subscribers have continued to increase, and more and more people are consuming it. Shanghai adds 250,000 to 260,000 new babies every year, with an average of one baby born every two minutes. The sales of supplementary foods such as milk, milk powder, and milk cakes are very large. In order to meet the needs of society, the government has worked hard to develop milk production. Since liberation, the number of dairy cows has increased from more than 3,600 to more than 11,000, and milk production has increased from more than 40,000 pounds per day to more than 150,000 pounds. The growth rate in the past eight years has exceeded more than twice that of the past 90 years. In terms of feed supply, the 8,900 dairy cows of the Milk Company alone require more than 2.6 million dan of feed per year. The supply of these feeds is closely related to suburban agricultural production, planned grain supply, and non-staple food arrangements, and is also related to the production and markets of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In short, the milk issue is related to the lives of the broad masses of the people and the market supply. How can the People's Government not manage such a major issue? It is precisely because the People's Government has managed it that Shanghai's milk production has basically met the rapidly growing needs of the people, and it has also reasonably adjusted prices three times, reducing the price of milk by about 30% compared to the past.

The toilet paper issue is similar. Last year, there was a shortage of toilet paper supply in the Shanghai market. Later investigation revealed that the supply of toilet paper had not decreased, but that the supply of Wenzhou toilet paper, a variety commonly used by Shanghai citizens, was insufficient. After discovering this situation, the government vigorously organized sources of goods, found substitutes, and ensured supply; at the same time, it improved market management, rationally distributed sources of goods, and strengthened publicity and education, persuading residents to change their habits and use more substitutes. It is precisely because the government managed it that the toilet paper problem was solved.

Milk, toilet paper, and so on. Aren't many other things in the people's economic life like this? Caring about the people's lives is the main point that distinguishes the People's Government from the reactionary regime. It is precisely because of the state's management that the stability of prices, the stability of people's lives, and the normal development of national construction have been guaranteed.

Numbers and Shells

Numbers and facts are the best weapons to counter the right-wing fallacies.

The anti-rightist struggle at this Shanghai People's Congress adopted the method of "presenting facts and reasoning," so there were particularly many statistics in the speeches. In the past, people often easily ignored a large string of dry and boring numbers, but this time, for some reason, it was particularly kind to hear, and it was listened to with relish. The announcement of some numbers often made the whole audience excited and the right-wing elements frustrated, as if a victorious battle had been fought.

Many numbers in the speeches are indeed the most powerful shells, for example:

The industrial output value increased by Shanghai in 1956 alone is equivalent to the total output value achieved by old Shanghai from 1843 to 1948 in 105 years.

Shanghai's heavy industry has increased eleven times compared to 1949.

The number of employed people in Shanghai has increased by 800,000 compared to 1949.

The number of medical outpatient institutions in Shanghai has increased by 5.5 times compared to before liberation. ...

As long as you pay a little attention, you can find that the fallacies of the right-wing elements have a common feature, that is, pretending to be ostentatious and alarmist, but the content is vague and general, and they always try their best to avoid numbers. Now, when people use numbers and facts to deal with him, he cannot escape.

The right-wing element Peng Wenyin is an example. At the Fourth Session of the First Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, he alarmingly described the urban hygiene of Shanghai as so dirty, saying: "...When it rains heavily, many roads are flooded, and the excrement from these cesspools overflows on the ground, flowing everywhere with a kind of golden-yellow thing, which contains various terrible bacteria such as cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery, as well as various terrible parasites such as blood flukes, roundworms, and hookworms...", which is really terrifying. However, there is not a single number or specific example in his entire speech.

Representative Wang Yuxian took out numbers and facts to confront him. The fact is: Shanghai was indeed a fairly dirty city before liberation, but it has fundamentally changed since liberation. Empty talk is useless; there are numbers to prove it. Here, he cited a large number of figures on urban hygiene work, such as the increase in various sanitary appliances, the increase in garbage and feces removal, and so on. Here I will only cite one number, that is: the death rate of Shanghai people was 19.1 per thousand in 1951, and it has dropped to 6.7 per thousand in 1956. May I ask Peng Wenyin, is the sanitation situation in Shanghai worse or better than in the past?

Two Types of Intellectuals

People all know that Zou Taofen and Wang Zaoshi were two of the famous "Seven Gentlemen," but these two people were two distinctly different types of intellectuals. Taofen was a left-wing intellectual who loved socialism and the working people, while Wang Zaoshi was a right-wing, anti-socialist bourgeois intellectual. Their fundamental differences were manifested very early on. Shen Cuizhen, Taofen's wife, in a speech at the meeting, talked about the two distinctly different performances of Taofen and Wang Zaoshi before and after the Seven Gentlemen's Prison.

Shen Cuizhen said: While in the Suzhou detention center, Taofen translated and wrote "Reading Occasional Translations," which he used as insights from studying Marxism-Leninism, and "Traces of Ping," which introduced the American progressive movement. The central idea was to support Marxism-Leninism and socialism, and his position was very clear. Wang Zaoshi also translated and published a book, "The Theory and Practice of the State," by Laski, which was the reactionary Fabian socialist theory that he yearned for. At that time, he already hated socialist democracy and tried to obscure the working class with the theory of the bourgeoisie deceiving the working class.

They had even sharper principled differences on the issue of resisting Japan and saving the country. Shen said: When Taofen was in prison, he often argued with Wang Zaoshi and Zhang Naiqi until their faces turned red over some dissenting opinions. Mainly: Taofen advocated mobilizing the masses, starting from awakening the masses, organizing the masses, and relying on the masses to resist Japan and save the country. Wang Zaoshi's motive was only to obtain political capital, focusing on relying on the Kuomintang. This was completely proved by the facts after his release from prison. After Taofen was released from prison, he immediately engaged in compiling the "Anti-Japanese Three-Day Journal," responding to the Party's call and conducting extensive propaganda and education work. Wang Zaoshi immediately defected to the Kuomintang after being released from prison, serving as a member of the Second Department (Strategic Department) of the Puppet Nanjing Headquarters and the Kuomintang Training Department. In 1938, he served as the Director of Education at the Kuomintang Political Training Institute in Nanchang, and later served as the Kuomintang's Military Discipline Inspection Committee, selling himself to the Kuomintang. After the Kuomintang launched the Southern Anhui Incident in 1941, the Kuomintang reactionaries closed down the Life Bookstore in large numbers. Taofen was extremely angry, resigned from his position as a National Senator, left for Hong Kong, and continued to call for unity and resistance to Japan in Hong Kong, exposing the Kuomintang reactionary conspiracy. Wang Zaoshi published an editorial entitled "Feelings on the Second National Senate" in the "Front Daily," which he edited, expressing "regret" for the Communist Party's refusal to participate in the just action of the Senate, saying that "military orders must be one, and organizations must be one," helping the Kuomintang to attack the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Border Region government.

And in this Party rectification movement, Wang Zaoshi, who had disguised himself as a "gentleman" for many years, finally exposed his true colors as a right-wing element, and was condemned and spurned by the people.

History has long determined that there can only be two paths in front of Chinese intellectuals: one is the path of Taofen, that is, to combine with the working people and serve the working people and socialism; the other is the path of Wang Zaoshi, adhering to the reactionary bourgeois stand, opposing socialism, and finally being thrown out of the historical carriage.

A Cartoon's Revision

Cartoonist Zhang Leping reviewed the errors in his past cartoon at the meeting, and immediately redrew one, the new work titled "Sweating Profusely, Unable to Move an Inch." When Zhang Leping participated in the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Conference, under the instigation of the right-wing element Shen Zhiyuan, he and Zhang Wenyuan jointly drew a cartoon entitled "Hardworking 'Housekeeper'," which was an illustration for Shen Zhiyuan's so-called right-wing fallacy of "the Party managing too much too rigidly." Zhang Leping said that he was very remorseful for this mistake. After this cartoon was published, a child wrote a letter to question him: "Uncle Zhang Leping, I have always liked to watch your paintings, but I really don't like the painting you and Zhang Wenyuan cooperated on in the Liberation Daily on the 17th. Have you forgotten the Sanmao wandering tale in your paintings of Sanmao? No wonder your new Sanmao has not been drawn yet. ..."

There was a completely different reaction from the right-wing elements. Shen Zhiyuan was very pleased to see the cartoon and called the Liberation Daily to express his praise. The next day, someone from the China Democratic League went to pull Zhang Leping into the League. Zhang Leping said angrily: "You are wrong. I have made a mistake. With the education of the Party, I will change. If you want to take advantage of the situation and pull me into your anti-Party gang, it will never be possible."

He said that he had participated in previous movements after liberation, and his self-transformation was insufficient. Only this time did he receive a profound education and realize that "for cartoonists, as vanguards on the ideological front, the most fundamental thing is a matter of standpoint. If the standpoint is firm and the major issues of right and wrong are clarified, what can't be drawn? Today we must use our brushes to criticize the right-wing elements, to criticize them until they are covered in wounds and bruises." During the meeting, he redrew a picture according to the original composition scene of that erroneous picture.

This painting shows a vivid fact: the torrent of the anti-rightist struggle has brightened the eyes of more and more people, awakened many who have been deceived, and returned them to the ranks of the anti-rightist struggle. This is truly the tragedy of the right-wing gentlemen. (Attached pictures)

    牛奶、草纸及其他
    本报记者　季音
    最近召开的上海市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上，上海人民与右派分子们进行了一场面对面的大论战。关于论战的经过和几个胜利的战役，本报已经分别作了报道。这里所写的，只是这次会议上的一些片段。
    牛奶和草纸
    “你们管得太多了，管得太死了！”这是几个月前右派分子们对党责难得最多的题目之一。上海的右派头目沈志远喊得最响亮，他在上海市委宣传会议上说：“现在连牛奶、草纸问题也要管理，这样下去，肚子痛，晚上睡不着觉也要找政府了。”
    沈志远是拿牛奶和草纸来借题发挥，攻击社会主义的计划经济，攻击社会主义制度。但是人们不妨就事论事，和右派先生们来评一评理。
    牛奶和草纸国家该不该管？是管坏了还是管好了？郭建等八位代表专门就这个问题作了发言，提供了许多令人信服的材料。他们说：牛奶现在已经不是解放前供少数人享受的营养食品，几年来牛奶订户不断增加，吃的人越来越多。上海每年新添婴儿二十五、六万人，平均每二分钟出生一个婴儿，牛奶、奶粉、奶糕等补充食品销量很大。为了满足社会的需要，政府努力发展了牛奶生产，解放后乳牛由三千六百多头增加到一万一千多头，产奶量由每日四万多磅增长到十五万多磅，八年多来的增长速度，超过了过去九十多年来的两倍以上。就饲料供应来说，单牛奶公司八千九百头乳牛，全年就需要饲料二百六十多万担，这些饲料的供应和郊区农业生产、粮食计划供应、副食品安排等都有密切关系，和江苏、浙江两省的生产和市场也有关系。总之牛奶问题关系到广大人民生活和市场供应，像这样一个重大问题，人民政府怎么能不管呢？正是由于人民政府管了，才使得上海的牛奶生产既基本上满足了人民急剧增长的需要，而且还三次合理地调整了价格，使牛奶价格比过去下降了约30％。
    草纸问题同样如此。去年上海市场曾经发生过草纸供应不足的现象。后来调查，发现草纸供应量并未减少，而是上海市民习惯用的温州草纸这种品种供应不足。发现这一情况后，政府就大力组织货源，找代用品，保证供应；同时改进市场管理，合理分配货源，并加强宣传教育，劝导居民改变习惯，多用代用品。正是由于政府管了，草纸问题才得到了解决。
    牛奶、草纸如此，人民经济生活中的其它许多事情何尝不是如此？关心人民生活，这本是人民政府区别于反动政权的主要之点。正是由于国家的管理，才保证了物价的平稳，人民生活的安定，国家建设事业的正常发展。
    数字和炮弹
    数字与事实是反击右派谬论的最好武器。
    这次上海人代会上的反右派斗争，采取了“摆事实、讲道理”的办法，所以发言中统计数字特别多。过去人们在会议中常常容易忽视一大串干燥乏味的数目字，但是这次不知怎的，听了却特别亲切，听得津津有味，有些数目字的宣布，常使全场振奋，使右派分子沮丧，就像打了一场胜仗一般。
    发言中的许多数目字确实是最有力的炮弹，例如：
    上海1956年一年所增长的工业产值，相当于旧上海从1843年到1948年一百零五年中才达到的生产总值。
    上海的重工业比1949年已经增长了十一倍。
    上海的劳动就业人数比1949年增加了八十万人。
    上海的医疗门诊机构比解放前增加五点五倍。……
    只要稍稍留意一下就可以发现，右派分子们的谬论有一个共同特色，这就是装腔作势，危言耸听，但内容含混，笼统，他们总是竭力避开数目字。现在，人们就用数目字和事实来对付他，就使他无法逃遁。
    右派分子彭文应就是个例子。他在上海市第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，危言耸听地把上海城市卫生如何肮脏，描述得活龙活现，说什么：“……遇着大雨，许多马路被水淹了，这些粪池里的粪汁，便溢出在地面上，到处乱流一种金黄色的东西，这里面有霍乱，伤寒，痢疾种种可怕的细菌，又有血吸虫、蛔虫、钩虫种种可怕的寄生虫……”，听了真是令人毛骨悚然，但是他的通篇讲话中没有一个数目字，也无具体实例。
    王聿先代表就拿出数字和事实来和他对质。事实是：上海在解放前确实是一个相当肮脏的城市，但解放后已根本改观了，空说无凭，有数字为证。这里，他例举了一大堆关于城市卫生工作方面的数字，诸如各种卫生器具的增加，垃圾、粪便清除量的增加等等。这里我只举一个数字，即：上海人民的死亡率，1951年时每千人中死亡19.1人，到1956年已下降到6.7人。请问彭文应，上海卫生状况比过去糟还是好？
    两种知识分子
    人们都知道，邹韬奋和王造时是著名的“七君子”中的两个，但是这两个人却是两种截然不同的知识分子的类型。韬奋是一个热爱社会主义和劳动人民的知识分子的左派，而王造时则是反社会主义的资产阶级知识分子右派。他们的根本分歧在很早以前就表现了出来。韬奋夫人沈粹缜在会上的一个发言中，谈到了七君子之狱前后韬奋与王造时的两种截然不同的表现。
    沈粹缜说：在苏州看守所里的时候，韬奋翻译和写作了他作为研读马列主义心得的“读书偶译”，介绍美国进步运动的“萍踪忆语”等书，其中心思想是拥护马列主义，拥护社会主义，立场非常鲜明。而王造时在看守所时期，也翻译出版了一本“国家的理论与实际”，是拉斯基著的，也就是他所向往的反动的费边社会主义的理论。他在那时候已经仇视社会主义民主，希图以资产阶级欺骗工人阶级的理论来模糊工人阶级。
    在抗日救国的问题上，他们更有原则上的尖锐分歧，沈说：韬奋在狱中时常常为一些不能苟同的意见同王造时和章乃器争论得面红耳赤。主要是：韬奋是主张发动群众，从唤醒群众出发，把群众组织起来，依靠群众来进行抗日救国。而王造时的动机仅仅在于获取政治资本，着重在依靠国民党。这在出狱以后的事实完全证明了。韬奋出狱后，立即从事编“抗战三日刊”，响应党的号召，进行广泛的宣传教育工作。而王造时在出狱后立即投奔国民党，任伪南京大本营第二部（战略部）及国民党组训部委员，1938年在南昌任国民党政治讲习院教务主任，以后又担任了国民党的军风纪巡察委员等职，向国民党卖身投靠。到1941年国民党发动皖南事变以后，国民党反动派大批封闭生活书店，韬奋愤怒已极，辞去国民参政员职，出走香港，在港继续号召团结抗战，揭露国民党反动派阴谋，而王造时则在他主编的“前方日报”上发表题为“二届参政会感言”的社论，竟对共产党拒绝参加参政会的正义行动表示“遗憾”，说什么“军令必须一个，组织必须一个”，帮助国民党向八路军新四军和边区政府进攻。
    而在这次党的整风运动中，伪装了“君子”多年的王造时，终于最后暴露了他右派分子的面目，遭到了人民的谴责和唾弃。
    历史早就决定了中国知识分子面前的道路只能有两条：一条是韬奋的路，即与劳动人民相结合、为劳动人民和社会主义服务的道路；一条就是王造时的路，坚持资产阶级反动立场，反对社会主义，最后就必然被抛出在历史车厢之外。
    一幅漫画的改作
    漫画家张乐平在会上检讨了他过去一幅漫画的错误，并且立即重新改画了一幅，新作的题目是“满头大汗，寸步难行”。张乐平在参加上海市委宣传会议的时候，在右派分子沈志远的煽动下，曾经和张文元合画了一幅题为“辛辛苦苦的‘当家人’”的漫画，为沈志远的所谓“党管得太多太死”的右派谬论作了插图。张乐平说，他对这个错误非常痛悔，在这幅漫画发表之后，曾经有个小朋友写信责问他：“张乐平叔叔，我一向很喜欢看你的画，但是在十七日解放日报上你和张文元合作的画，我非常不喜欢，你难道已忘记了你自己画的三毛流浪记里的三毛了？难怪你的新三毛到现在还不画出来。……”
    在右派分子那里是完全不同的另一种反映。沈志远看到漫画很得意，曾打电话给解放日报表示赞扬。第二天，民盟就有人去拉张乐平入盟。张乐平激愤地说：“你们想错了，我犯了错误，有党的教育，我会改，你们想钻空子，把我拉到你们的反党黑帮里去，是万万办不到的。”
    他说，解放后他参加过历次运动，自己改造不够，唯有这次使他深刻受到了教育，体会到了“漫画家，作为思想战线上的尖兵，最根本的是一个立场问题。立场站稳了，大是大非辨明了，有什么不可以画的呢？在今天我们就要用画笔批判右派分子，要批判得他们体无完肤。”就在会议期间，他按照那幅错误的画的原来构图场面，重新画了一幅画。
    这幅画表明着一个生动的事实：反右派斗争的洪流使愈来愈多的人洗亮了眼睛，使不少受到过蒙蔽的人醒悟过来，并且返身投入了反右派斗争的行列。这真是右派先生们的悲剧。（附图片）
