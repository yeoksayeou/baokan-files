	The game was tense from beginning to end. The Polish team scored three consecutive goals at the start. The Chinese team calmly responded and then launched an offensive. They shot quickly and accurately, using clever methods to steal the ball, and tied with the Polish team at 8-7 and 21-21.

	In the second half, the Chinese team launched a fierce attack, and despite the Polish team's effective defense, the Chinese team gradually caught up, creating a tense situation where the Polish team led by only three points at 38-35.

	Finally, under the repeated attacks of the Polish team, the Chinese team lost to the Polish team by a margin of seventeen points.

    我学生男子篮球队在巴黎一胜一负
    新华社巴黎2日电  参加庆祝法国全国学生联合会成立五十周年运动会的中国学生男子篮球队，在9月1日的预赛中以五十五比七十二败于波兰学生篮球队。
    这场球赛自始至终非常紧张。波兰队开始时连续投进三球。中国队沉着应付，随后就发动攻势。他们投篮迅速、准确，利用巧妙的方法夺球，先后和波兰队打成过八比七的赢局和二十一比二十一的平局。但是，由于波兰队采取攻势和中国队的努力不能持久，上半场中国队输了七分（二十四比三十一）。
    在下半场的比赛中，中国队发动猛攻，因而尽管波兰队作了有效的防御，仍被中国队逐渐追上，出现了波兰队仅以三十八比三十五领先三分的紧张局面。
    最后，终于在波兰队的一再进攻下，中国队以十七分之差败于波兰队。
    又电  中国学生男子篮球队，在8月31日下午进行的篮球预赛中以六十六比四十二战胜西德学生篮球队。
