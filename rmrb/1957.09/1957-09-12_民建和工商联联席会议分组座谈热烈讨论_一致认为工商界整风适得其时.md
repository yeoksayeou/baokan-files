Xinhua News Agency, 11th - Over two hundred members attending the joint meeting of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held group discussions on the 10th and 11th, enthusiastically discussing the issue of rectification in the industrial and commercial sectors.

During the discussions, the members, in connection with the actual situation in various localities and their personal experiences, believed that carrying out a rectification movement, including the struggle against rightists, in the national industrial and commercial sectors at present is timely and of great significance. Representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors from Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places spoke about their understanding of the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sectors from the relationship between rectification and the anti-rightist struggle. Some members also used specific facts to illustrate that the rightists' remarks did indeed have a very bad influence on the majority of industrialists and businessmen. For example, the political school for the industrial and commercial sectors in Siping City was forced to suspend classes for a week because the students were poisoned by Zhang Naiqi's ideas and were unwilling to study; most of the more than 600 students in the training class for the industrial and commercial sectors in Xi'an resonated with the rightist remarks. These facts show that it is urgently necessary to carry out a comprehensive rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sectors. Le Songsheng from Beijing said that after participating in the anti-rightist struggle, he more clearly recognized his bourgeois nature. If he does not undergo a transformation through the rectification movement, there is no way to talk about reform. Bian Zidong from Tianjin said that since handing over the means of production, small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen have been waiting to remove their "hats" and have relaxed their ideological remolding. Now, upon inspection, their minds are full of bourgeois ideas. Without rectification, these ideas cannot be changed.

Committee members from Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places analyzed the current performance of the bourgeoisie in terms of political stance. They fully agreed with Chen Shutong's estimate in his report: the stance issue of most industrialists and businessmen has not yet been resolved. Zhang Jingli from Jiangsu believes that it is very dangerous to take the capitalist stance to follow the socialist road. He expressed that he must actively participate in the rectification movement and pass the socialist test well.

Xu Xuexuan and Dan Bokun, committee members from Wuhan, listed many facts to illustrate the necessity of carrying out the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sectors. For example, some people openly proposed that state-owned enterprises should provide sources of goods, banks should provide funds, and the tax bureau should reduce taxes. This is the absurd argument of not wanting to be reformed. Some private personnel embezzle state property and squander it; some use their powers to resist the tasks assigned by the state; some withdraw funds to set up underground factories, causing difficulties for the factory's production and the lives of the workers. They said that these all show that the capitalist negative side of industrialists and businessmen is still very serious, and a profound socialist revolution must be carried out in politics and ideology.

All groups talked about overcoming the spirit of leniency in the anti-rightist struggle. Huang Yanpei said in the Shanghai group discussion that he said in his opening remarks that everyone must pass the socialist test, and every industrialist and businessman must also pass the socialist test. Now he feels that not only that, but everyone must also help everyone else pass the socialist test, and at the same time, no one is allowed to block us from passing this test. He said that we should not only not be lenient towards rightists, but also overcome the spirit of leniency towards our own ideological problems. He himself often struggles between socialism and individualism. He said that we must distinguish between today's "new self" and yesterday's "old self", and ruthlessly abandon the shortcomings of the "old self". The Shanghai group also had a debate when discussing this issue. Individual committee members suggested that towards rightists, we should be serious during struggles at meetings, but we can be "warmer" when talking to them individually and helping them, saying that this would be more effective in saving the rightists. However, the majority raised objections. They believed that in the struggle against rightists, no matter what form is adopted, everyone's attitude and stance should be consistent, and there should never be leniency or accommodation.

　　民建和工商联联席会议分组座谈热烈讨论
　　一致认为工商界整风适得其时
    据新华社11日讯　参加民主建国会中央委员会和全国工商联执行委员会联席会议的二百多位委员，10日和11日分组举行座谈，热烈讨论工商界整风问题。
    委员们在讨论中联系到各地的实际情况和本人的体会，认为目前在全国工商界开展一个包括反右派斗争在内的整风运动，适得其时，意义十分重大。上海、北京、天津、辽宁、陕西、甘肃等地的工商界代表人士，从整风和反右派的关系中谈到了他们对工商界开展整风运动的认识，有的委员还用具体事实说明，右派分子的言论在广大工商业者中的确发生了很恶劣的影响。如四平市的工商界政治学校，因为学员中了章乃器的毒素，不愿学习，曾经被迫停了一个星期的课；西安市工商界讲习班六百多个学员，大多数跟右派言论起共鸣。这些事实表明，在工商界中全面开展整风运动是迫切需要的。北京乐松生说，参加了反右派斗争以后，他更清楚地认识到自己的资产阶级本质，如果不乘整风运动脱胎换骨，就谈不到改造。天津边子栋说，中小工商户自从生产资料交出以后，一直在等着摘“帽子”，放松了思想改造，现在检查起来，满脑子尽是资产阶级思想，不整风，这思想是改变不了的。
    江苏、山东、安徽、福建、浙江等地的委员们，分析了目前资产阶级在政治立场上的表现，他们完全同意陈叔通在报告中所估计的：大多数工商业者的立场问题还没有解决。江苏张敬礼认为，站在资本主义立场来走社会主义道路是很危险的，他表示一定要积极参加整风运动，过好社会主义这一关。
    来自武汉市的委员徐雪轩和但伯昆列举出许多事实，说明在工商界开展整风运动的必要性。例如有人公开提出要国营企业给货源，要银行给资金，要税务局减轻税收，这就是不要改造的荒谬论调。有的私方人员盗卖国家财产，大肆挥霍；有的利用职权，抗拒国家交给的任务；有的抽逃资金另搞地下工厂，使本厂的生产和工人生活都发生困难。他们说，这些都说明工商业者资本主义的消极一面还是十分严重的，必须在政治上、思想上进行一次深刻的社会主义革命。
    各小组都谈到了在反右派斗争中克服温情主义的问题。黄炎培在上海小组座谈中说，他在开幕词中说过，每一个人都要过社会主义这一关，每一个工商业者也都要过社会主义这一关。现在觉得不仅如此，每个人还要帮助大家过社会主义这一关，同时还不许有人阻挡我们过这一关，他说，我们不但对待右派分子不能温情，对待自己的思想问题也要克服温情主义。他自己就经常在社会主义和个人主义之间进行斗争。他说，我们要区别今天的“新我”和昨天的“旧我”，对待“旧我”的缺点要无情地割弃。上海小组在讨论这个问题时，还展开了争论。个别委员提出，对于右派分子，在会议上斗争时应该严肃，而在个别谈话，进行帮助时就可以“温暖”些，说这样对于挽救右派分子效果更大。但是多数人提出了不同意见，他们认为，对右派分子的斗争，无论采用什么形式，大家的态度和立场都应该是一致的，决不应该温情、姑息。
