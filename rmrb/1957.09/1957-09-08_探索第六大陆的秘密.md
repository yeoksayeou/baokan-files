    Exploring the Secrets of the Sixth Continent
    The sixth continent – Antarctica – although it has been explored by humans for over a hundred years, more than 90% of the area remains uncharted. It is now known that Antarctica has abundant coal reserves, no less than those of the United States. Copper, zinc, lead, graphite, and gold have also been discovered.
    On January 16, 1820, participants Belinsgauzen and Lazarev of the first Russian Antarctic expedition first saw the ice-covered coast of the Antarctic continent. Since then, hundreds of exploration ships have come to the shore, but massive ice blocks have blocked the way. What lies before the explorers is the mysterious continent hidden behind blizzards and thick fogs. The climatic conditions in Antarctica are very harsh, with summer temperatures often dropping to minus twenty degrees Celsius, and winter temperatures often dropping to minus eighty degrees Celsius. Therefore, the first geological exploration of the Antarctic continent did not begin until 1895. At the beginning of the twentieth century, many scientific expeditions visited the Antarctic coast. By 1955, various countries had established more than twenty meteorological stations in Antarctica and its surrounding islands.
    In the International Geophysical Year, which began on July 1 this year, Antarctic exploration has received special attention. In addition to the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Belgium are also participating in the exploration. The largest explorations are being carried out by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
    The International Geophysical Year Committee has allocated the area between 80 and 105 degrees east longitude to the Soviet Union for exploration. The task of the Soviet explorers is to study geomagnetism, auroras, and other phenomena. The Soviet Union plans to establish three basic stations on the Antarctic continent. The first station, "Mirny," began operating in early 1956; the second station, "Vostok," is currently being established by the second group of participants in the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, near the South Geomagnetic Pole; the third station, "Sovetskaya," will be located in the very center of the ice field, near the hard-to-reach extreme.
    In the past year or so, the Soviet Antarctic Expedition has collected a large amount of material and has achieved great success. Soviet geologists Ravich and Klimov studied the structure of the Bunger Hills in detail. This is an area of melted ice and snow in the Antarctic ice field, covering an area of about seven hundred square kilometers. The granite and schist found there are similar to those in India, Ceylon, and other places. Geologist Voronov lived in Antarctica for more than a year. He studied the area around the Mirny village and collected rich materials on the geological structure and freezing conditions of the vast areas of eastern Antarctica.
    Now, a column of Soviet explorers' tractors is marching towards the icy plateau deep inside the continent against fierce hurricanes. The work of the Soviet expedition continues, and they will uncover many secrets of the Antarctic continent during this International Geophysical Year.
    American scientists are preparing to establish seven stations in Antarctica, three basic stations and four auxiliary stations. In addition to establishing nine new stations, British scientists are preparing to conduct an exploration across the Antarctic continent. Australian explorers are starting to build a third observation station.
    During the International Geophysical Year, the entire Antarctic continent will be explored. The results of the exploration will provide answers to a series of questions that have been swirling in the minds of explorers for decades, such as "Is the Antarctic continent a single landmass?" "How were the huge mountains that encircle the ancient Antarctic region formed?" "What useful mineral deposits are hidden under the Antarctic ice cap?" (Attached picture)

    探索第六大陆的秘密
    第六大陆——南极——虽然经过了人类一百多年的考察，但至今90％以上的地区仍然是空白点。现在已经知道，南极煤的蕴藏很丰富，不亚于美国。并且还发现有铜、锌、铅、石墨和金子。
    1820年1月16日，第一支俄国南极考察队的参加者别林斯高津和拉札列夫第一次看到了冰封的南极大陆海岸。以后，有数百条考察船曾来到岸边，但是大量的冰块阻塞了道路，在考察者面前的是，隐藏在暴风雪和浓雾背后的神秘大陆。南极的气候条件非常恶劣，夏季气温时常降到零下二十度，冬天往往降到零下八十多度。因此，直到1895年方才开始了南极大陆的第一次地质考察。二十世纪初，许多科学考察队到过南极沿岸。到1955年，各国在南极及其周围的岛屿上已经建立了二十多个气象站。
    在今年7月1日开始的国际地球物理年中，南极考察受到特别注意。参加考察的除了苏联以外，还有美国、英国、法国、阿根廷、智利、澳大利亚、日本、新西兰、比利时等国。考察规模最大的是苏联、美国和英国。
    国际地球物理年委员会分配苏联考察的是东经八十度到一百零五度之间的地区。苏联考察者的任务是，研究地磁、极光和其他一些现象。苏联打算在南极大陆上建立三个基本站。第一个站“和平”已经在1956年初开始工作了；第二个站“东方”现在正由苏联南极考察队第二批参加者在建立中，站址在南地磁极附近；第三个站“苏维埃”将设在冰野的最中心，在难以到达的极端附近。
    苏联南极考察队在过去一年多的工作中，搜集了大量的材料，收获很大。苏联地质学家拉维奇和克里莫夫详尽地研究了班格尔州的结构。这是位于南极冰野中的一块冰雪溶化地区，面积约为七百平方公里。在那里发现的花岗石和片页岩同印度、锡兰等地的类似。地质学家沃罗诺夫在南极住了一年多。他研究了“和平”村一带的地区，收集了有关南极东部辽阔地区地质结构和冰冻情况的丰富材料。
    现在，苏联考察者的拖拉机大队正迎着猛烈的飓风向积冰的高原深处进军。苏联考察队的工作在继续开展，他们将在这届国际地球物理年中揭穿南极大陆的很多秘密。
    美国科学家准备在南极建立七个站，三个基本站，四个辅助站。英国科学家除了建立九个新站以外，准备进行一次横穿南极大陆的考察。澳大利亚考察者们正在着手建立第三个观测站。
    在国际地球物理年间，整个南极大陆都将得到考察。考察的结果将使盘旋在考察者们脑中数十年的问题，如“南极大陆是不是一个整体？”“把古老的南极地区圈起来的巨大山脉是怎样形成的？”“南极大陆冰甲下藏着什么有用的矿藏？”等一系列问题得到解答。（附图片）
