Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: A major achievement in the ongoing rectification campaign in Beijing's commercial system is the reduction of management personnel in thirty-eight commercial companies from the original 5,887 to 2,522, a cut of 57%. Among the units that have streamlined their organizations, the companies under the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Non-Staple Food Commerce have reduced management personnel by 66.5%, the companies under the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative by 64.5%, the Bureau of Commerce by 55%, the Bureau of Grain by 52.7%, and the Bureau of Foreign Trade by 37%.

　　The commercial system in Beijing generally suffered from bloated management organizations and overstaffing. For example, the Beijing Textile Products Purchasing and Supply Station had 256 staff members, but there was too little work for too many people, resulting in very low efficiency. One field team of this supply station was even dubbed a "warehouse for idlers" by the masses. In the business section of the Municipal State-Owned Commercial Warehousing Company, one cadre only wrote a capital construction budget and final account statistical report each month. The workers and masses had long held many opinions about this situation. During the rectification movement, each unit, in line with the spirit of conducting rectification and reform simultaneously, resolved to thoroughly solve this problem. During the movement, all professional companies organized all employees to conduct in-depth discussions on the issue of streamlining organizations. For leading cadres, special emphasis was placed on the need to thoroughly change the bureaucratic work style through rectification. As a result, all units achieved a consensus from top to bottom, enabling the streamlining work to proceed smoothly. After discussions, methods were proposed to simplify unnecessary forms and reports, new systems were formulated, and the number of levels and assistants and deputies of leading cadres were reduced. Managers and section chiefs personally took action to directly solve problems. For example, some units merged companies or departments with similar businesses. The Municipal Bureau of Commerce has decided to merge the Knitwear Company, the Watches and Spectacles Company, and the Department Store Wholesale Station into the Department Store Wholesale Company. The Bureau of Grain has merged the Feed Company and the Grain Supply Company into the Grain Supply Company. The personnel section and labor and wages section, the business section and sundry goods section, and the secretariat and supervision office of these two companies were also merged, reducing the staff of these departments from the original 121 to 49, a reduction of 60%.

　　The personnel who have been streamlined have been properly resettled. Among them, 1,930 people have been sent to grassroots stores to participate in production and management, and another 450 have participated in agricultural production in the suburbs. This group of cadres has begun to play an active role after being assigned to the grassroots level. For example, Tian Chungge, the former secretary of the Feed Company of the Bureau of Grain, has gradually become familiar with grain varieties and prices after being assigned to work as a grain seller in a grassroots store. He is also preparing to help the leadership study and improve the problem of excessively long waiting times for the masses to purchase grain.

    边整边改的重大成果
    北京商业系统管理人员精简过半
    据新华社27日讯　北京市三十八个商业公司管理机构的人员，目前已由原来的五千八百八十七人，减少到二千五百二十二人，精简了57％，这是开展整风运动以来，北京市商业系统边整边改的重要成果之一。在这些精简机构的单位中，北京市副食品商业局所属各公司共精简管理人员66.5％，市供销合作社所属公司精简了64.5％，商业局精简了55％，粮食局精简了52.7％，对外贸易局精简了37％。
    北京市商业系统各公司普遍存在着管理机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象。如北京纺织品采购供应站有二百五十六个工作人员，人多事少，工作效率很低。这个供应站的一个外勤组甚至被群众称为“闲人仓库”。市国营商业仓储公司业务科，有一个干部每月只写一份基建预决算统计表。职工群众对这种情况早就有许多意见，在整风运动中各单位根据边整边改的精神，都决心彻底解决这个问题。各专业公司在运动中都组织全体职工对精简机构问题进行了深入的讨论，对于领导干部，特别强调必须通过整风彻底改变官僚主义的工作作风，这样，各单位从上到下认识一致，使精简工作得以顺利进行。经过讨论后，提出了简化不必要的表报的办法，订出新的制度，减少了层次和领导干部的助手、副职。经理、科长都亲自动手，直接解决问题。如有的单位将业务相近的公司或科室合并，市商业局已决定将针棉织品公司、钟表眼镜公司和百货批发站合并为百货批发公司；粮食局已经将饲料公司和粮食供应公司合并为粮食供应公司。这两个公司里的人事科和劳动工资科、业务科和杂品科、秘书室和监察室也都分别合并，这几个科室就由原来的一百二十一人精简为四十九人，减少了60％。
    被精简的人员都已经得到了妥善的安置，其中有一千九百三十人下放到基层商店参加生产和管理工作，另有四百五十多人参加了郊区农业生产。这批干部充实基层后，开始发挥了积极作用。如粮食局原饲料公司的秘书主任田春革，分配到基层商店做售粮工作后，已经逐渐熟悉粮食品种和价格，他并准备帮助领导研究和改进群众购粮排队等候时间过长的问题。
