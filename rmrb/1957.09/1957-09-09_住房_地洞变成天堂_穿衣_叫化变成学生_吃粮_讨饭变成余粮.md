    Housing – From Caves to Paradise
    Clothing – From Beggars to Students
    Food – From Begging to Surplus Grain
    The vast majority of members from the Xigou and Renjiayu agricultural cooperatives in Yan'an Township, Wushan County, Gansu Province, participated in discussions on "Is the superiority of cooperation great?". Everyone believed that the superiority of cooperation was endless. First, after the unified management of land, planting could be carried out according to local conditions, giving full play to the land's fertility, and income increased year by year as a result. The fact that the total income of the two cooperatives in 1956 increased by 25.27% compared to 1955 powerfully illustrates this point. Secondly, cooperation has unleashed labor potential. Last year, two canals were built, turning more than 600 mu of dry land into paddy fields, increasing production by ten jin per mu, for a total increase of 6,000 jin of grain; in the past, due to insufficient labor, more than 460 mu of poor land had never been fertilized, but now they have been fertilized with soil and manure, turning into good land, and an increase of ten jin per mu is no problem, for a total increase of more than 4,600 jin. After cooperation, because the land was connected into large tracts, a total of 34 field ridges were leveled, which not only facilitated cultivation but also increased the cultivated area; due to the centralized use of funds, the entire cooperative purchased a batch of new-style walking plows, 666 pesticide powder, Ceresan pesticide powder, chemical fertilizers, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, etc. last year, which played a significant role in increasing production. In addition, sideline income has also increased.
    The members refuted the right-wing elements' claim that "people's living standards have declined" as blatant lies. In these two cooperatives, out of a total of 120 households, 106 households in the old society were short of food every year, and many families could not afford the next meal, and during the lean season, the pot would not be uncovered for days. But now? Eighty-one households in the entire cooperative have enough to eat, and although the remaining households do not have enough, the cooperative helps and the government provides timely supplies, so no one goes hungry. In the old society, the two cooperatives with more than 100 households had only three quilts, 35 households used oat straw as bedding, and it was not uncommon for a husband and wife to share a pair of pants, and children in their teens had no pants to wear. Now, the two cooperatives have a total of 88 quilts, and in winter, everyone has cotton pants to wear. Song Guodong, who used to share a pair of pants with his wife, now has four quilts at home, and each of his twelve family members has two pairs of single pants. He Yanqing's family had been begging for three generations in the old society, but last year he became a surplus grain household. In the old society, 54 households in the two cooperatives owned their own houses, while the rest rented houses from landlords and rich peasants. Now, 118 households own their own houses.
    After discussion, everyone believed that there were three major changes in life in the new society: in terms of housing: "caves have become paradise"; in terms of clothing: "beggars have become students"; in terms of food: "beggars have become surplus grain households." These are undeniable facts.

### 住房——地洞变成天堂  穿衣——叫化变成学生  吃粮——讨饭变成余粮

    住房——地洞变成天堂
    穿衣——叫化变成学生
    吃粮——讨饭变成余粮
    甘肃武山县延安乡西沟和任家峪两个农业社的绝大部分社员，参加了“合作化的优越性大不大”的讨论。大家都认为，合作化的优越性是说不完的。首先是土地统一经营后，能因地种植发挥地力，收入因此年年增加。1956年两社总收入比1955年增加25.27％，就有力地说明了这一点。其次是合作化发挥了劳动潜力，去年一年中修水渠两条，将六百多亩川旱地变成了水田，每亩增产十斤，共增产六千斤粮食；过去因劳力不足，从没上过粪的四百六十多亩薄地，现在上了肥土和粪，变为好地，每亩增产十斤也没问题，共可增产四千六百多斤。合作化以后，因为土地连成大片，一共平地埂三十四条，不但便利耕作，而且增加了耕地面积；由于资金集中使用，去年全社购买一批新式步犁、六六六药粉、赛力散药粉、化学肥料、固氮菌等，对增产起了很大的作用。另外，副业收入也增多了。
    社员们批驳右派分子说“人民生活下降了”是睁着眼说瞎话。这两个社，共一百二十户，旧社会有一百零六户，年年缺吃，很多人家上顿接不上下顿，到青黄不接时就几天不揭锅盖。而现在呢？全社够吃的有八十一户，其余的户，虽不够吃，但社里帮助和政府及时供应，都没有挨饿。在旧社会，两社一百多户只有三条被子，用燕麦草当铺盖的有三十五户，有夫妻二人穿一条裤子的，十几岁的儿童没有穿裤子，一点不奇怪。现在，两社共有被子八十八条，冬天，都有棉裤穿。过去两口穿一条裤子的宋国栋，现在家里有四条被子，全家十二口人，每人有单裤子两件。何彦清三辈子人在旧社会讨饭，去年变成余粮户了。旧社会，两个社自己有房的是五十四户，其余都是租住地主、富农的房，现在有一百十八户自己有房。
    经过讨论，大家认为新社会在生活上有三大改变：从住房来说：“地洞变成了天堂”；从穿衣来说：“叫化子变成学生了”；从吃粮来说：“讨饭的变成余粮户”。这都是些不可争辩的事实。
