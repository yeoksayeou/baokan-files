Xinhua News Agency, 31st - The Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce held a joint expanded meeting of the Standing Committee yesterday afternoon, deciding to immediately launch a rectification movement among the city's more than 20,000 industrialists and businessmen.

The meeting, based on the specific circumstances of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles, decided to conduct the rectification movement, including the anti-rightist struggle, in stages and batches. The first batch to participate in the rectification are all executive committee members of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, as well as the backbone members of the working committees of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the federations of industry and commerce in various districts, totaling about 3,000 people.

Le Songsheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, reported on the situation of the anti-rightist struggle in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles in the previous stage.

Our newspaper Shanghai, 1st - Shanghai's 200,000 industrialists and businessmen will begin rectification in batches and stages from September. This was decided at the joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce on August 30. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles Rectification Work Committee, which leads this movement, has been established at the meeting. The work plan for rectification has also been determined, and specific preparations are now underway.

Through more than two months of anti-rightist struggle and criticism and self-criticism that connects with reality and ideology, many industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai feel even more that since the high tide of joint state-private ownership last year, the positions, viewpoints, and ideological styles of most people in the industrial and commercial circles have not changed accordingly with the transformation of their economic status. The question of which is superior, capitalism or socialism, and which path to take, has not been fundamentally resolved. Therefore, the fallacies of the rightists have found a broad market in the industrial and commercial circles. For this reason, it is even more urgently needed to launch a rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles with the educational content of opposing the rightists, destroying the capitalist position, and establishing the socialist position.

The purpose and requirements of this rectification in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles are: Through this movement, industrialists and businessmen should recognize that rightists are bourgeois reactionaries who are anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist. Their ultimate goal is to attempt to restore capitalism. If the rightists are not thoroughly defeated, our country cannot smoothly follow the socialist road; industrialists and businessmen should understand that in today's socialist society, where the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, the socialist revolution has achieved a basic victory, it is reactionary to persist in the capitalist position; they should politically and ideologically clearly recognize that only by accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and following the socialist road is there a bright future.

The rectification work plan points out that this rectification movement in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles must closely rely on the leadership and assistance of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The plan also puts forward four requirements: 1. Resolutely and thoroughly defeat the rightists in the industrial and commercial circles; 2. Destroy the capitalist position and establish the socialist position; 3. Sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party; 4. Wholeheartedly follow the socialist road.

The rectification movement in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles will mainly take the form of centralized study. In the overall rectification, a major debate will be launched based on the seven issues raised by Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as the main content. Through debate, it is necessary to politically and ideologically clarify that the capitalist position must be negated, in order to lay a favorable foundation for continuing to accept socialist transformation politically and ideologically in the future.

The heads of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles have expressed their agreement with the speech of Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on launching a comprehensive rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles, and will guide the rectification in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles in accordance with the principles put forward in the speech. Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: Minister Li Weihan's speech made clear instructions on the great significance and deployment of launching a comprehensive rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles, and put forward seven central topics for debate, which greatly inspired us in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles and made us clearly recognize the direction of the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement. We must implement it in accordance with Minister Li Weihan's instructions.

    坚决打垮右派，一心一意走社会主义道路
    北京上海工商界开始整风
    新华社31日讯  中国民主建国会北京市委员会和北京市工商业联合会昨天下午举行常委联席扩大会议，决定立即在全市两万多名工商业者中开展整风运动。
    会议根据北京市工商界的具体情况，决定分期、分批地进行包括反右派斗争在内的整风运动。第一批参加整风的是民建北京市委员会和北京市工商联的全体执行委员，以及民建各区工作委员会和各区工商联的骨干分子，共三千人左右。
    民建北京市委员会副主任委员乐松生，在会上报告了北京工商界前一阶段反右派斗争的情况。
    本报上海1日电  上海市二十万工商业者将从9月份开始分批分期地进行整风。这是民建上海市委和上海市工商联8月30日常委联席会议作出的决定。领导这个运动的上海市工商界整风工作委员会已在会上成立。关于整风的工作规划也已确定，现在正在紧张地进行具体的筹备工作。
    上海工商业者通过两个多月来的反右派斗争，和联系实际、联系思想的批评与自我批评，很多工商业者更加感觉到工商界中大部分人自去年公私合营高潮以来，立场观点以及思想作风还没有跟着经济地位的转变而相应地转变，对资本主义和社会主义谁劣谁优、何去何从的问题，还没有根本解决，因而，右派分子的谬论在工商界中找到了广阔的市场。为此，在工商界中展开一个以反对右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为教育内容的整风运动，更加迫切需要。
    这次上海工商界整风的目的和要求是：通过这一运动，使工商界人士认识右派分子是反共反人民反社会主义的资产阶级反动派，他们的最后目的是企图使资本主义复辟，不彻底打垮右派分子，我国就不能顺利走社会主义道路；使工商界人士懂得在生产关系已经发生根本变化，社会主义革命已经取得基本胜利，我国已进入社会主义社会的今天，再坚持资本主义立场是反动的；使他们从政治上、思想上明确认识只有接受共产党的领导，走社会主义道路才是光明大道。
    整风工作规划指出：这次工商界整风运动必须紧密依靠中共上海市委的领导和帮助。规划中还提出了四项要求：一、坚决彻底打垮工商界中的右派分子；二、破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场；三、真心诚意接受共产党领导；四、一心一意走社会主义道路。
    上海工商界的整风运动主要将采取集中学习的形式。在全面整风中，将根据中共中央统战部部长李维汉的谈话中所提出的七个问题为主要内容，展开大辩论。通过辩论，从政治上和思想上明确必须否定资本主义立场，为今后继续在政治上和思想上接受社会主义改造打下有利的基础。
    上海市工商界的负责人，纷纷表示同意中共中央统战部部长李维汉关于工商界全面开展整风运动的谈话，并将按照谈话中提出的原则来指导上海市工商界的整风。上海市工商联主任委员盛丕华说：李维汉部长的谈话对于工商界开展全面整风运动的重大意义和部署作了明确的指示，并提出七个辩论中心题目，这使我们上海工商界获得很大启发，使我们明确认识了反右派斗争和整风运动的方针。我们一定要按照李维汉部长的指示贯彻下去。
