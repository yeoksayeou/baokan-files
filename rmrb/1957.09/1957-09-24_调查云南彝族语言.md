    Survey of the Yi Language in Yunnan
    The Fourth Working Team for Minority Languages Survey of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has arrived in batches in the Yi-inhabited areas of Yunnan to conduct surveys and phonetic comparison of dialects in the Yi areas. They plan to propose a Yi writing scheme for Yunnan within this year.
    Last year, after the survey team concluded its work on the Sichuan Yi language in the Liangshan area of Sichuan, it conducted a general study of the Yunnan Yi language, initially categorizing the Yunnan Yi language into more than 4,000 vocabulary words and more than 2,000 supplementary vocabulary words. Now, they are taking these vocabulary words and local dialects back to the Yi people in Yunnan for supplementation and phonetic comparison, while continuing to collect dialects and vocabulary from various Yi groups in Yunnan.
    The Yi people are the most populous ethnic minority in Yunnan, with a total population of more than 1.83 million, including more than 30 branches, residing in scattered areas, almost all over the province. The languages also have their own similarities and differences. At present, only a very small number of branches have a kind of incomplete hieroglyphic writing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    调查云南彝族语言
    中国科学院少数民族语言调查第四工作队已经分批到达云南彝族聚居地区，对彝族地区方言进行调查和对音等工作。他们准备在今年内提出云南彝族文字方案。
    去年，这支调查队在四川凉山地区结束了四川彝语调查工作以后，便对云南彝语进行了一般研究，把云南彝语初步归为四千多个词汇和二千多个补充词汇。现在，他们把这些词汇和地方方言再拿到云南彝族人民中进行补充和对音，同时继续收集云南各地彝族的方言和词汇。
    彝族是云南少数民族中人口最多的一个民族，共有一百八十三万多人，包括三十多个支系，居住地区分散，几乎遍及全省各县。语言也各有异同之处。现在，仅有极少部分支系中有着一种残缺不全的象形文字。　（新华社）
