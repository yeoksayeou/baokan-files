A total of 35,000 metallurgical workers in the Loire, Saint-Étienne, Saint-Chamond, and the Schneider factories have been on strike since the 26th, demanding that employers raise hourly wages by 30 francs. The 550 technical workers in Marcoule have been on strike for four days as of the 25th.

The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement on the 26th, pointing out that the French working class has achieved certain successes in the struggle for its own rights. In addition to the unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, the unions affiliated with the "French Confederation of Christian Workers" and the "Workers' Force General Confederation" are also participating in the struggle against the government's policies, which creates "new conditions for strengthening united action." The Executive Bureau also strongly condemned the government's draft "fundamental law" for Algeria.

    法国罢工运动不断扩大
    各派工会都参加斗争
    据新华社巴黎26日电　法国的罢工运动不断扩大，已经席卷了许多重要的企业部门。
    罗亚尔省、圣亚田省、圣夏蒙省以及施奈德工厂的总共三万五千名冶金工人，从26日起举行罢工，要求资方将每小时工资提高三十法郎。马库勒的五百五十名技术工人到25日为止已经进入了罢工的第四天。在巴黎区，圣但尼的一万五千冶金工人26日举行了争取权利日。
    比扬古的雷诺汽车工厂的五万七千名工人已经决定从27日起停止工作。下罗亚尔省的三万五千名冶金工人已经决定从10月1日起停止工作。
    法国全国铁路工人已经向政府提出警告，假如在9月底以前仍然拒绝讨论他们增加工资的要求，他们将在10月份的第一周举行四十八小时的罢工。
    法国总工会执行局26日发表声明指出，法国工人阶级在争取自身权利的斗争中取得了一定的成就。参加反对政府政策斗争的，除了总工会系统的各工会外，还有“天主教劳工联盟”和“工人力量总工会”系统的各工会，这就创造了“加强一致行动的新条件”。执行局还激烈谴责政府的阿尔及利亚“根本法”草案。
