No U.S. Exploitation of the UN to Invade Syria
By our commentator

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly on the 19th, in which he vehemently attacked the Soviet Union and Syria. This speech fully exposed the U.S. ruling clique's hatred of the Soviet Union, a defender of world peace, and its ambition to invade the Middle East and suppress the Middle Eastern national independence movement.

In his speech, Dulles disregarded facts known to the whole world and went to great lengths to distort the truth about the situation inside Syria. He even openly interfered in Syria's internal affairs at the UN General Assembly, disregarding the principles of the UN Charter.

Dulles slandered the Soviet Union's policy of supporting Arab people's struggle for independence, and vilified the legitimate demands of Arab people's nationalism as "ambition." Dulles' slander is not surprising. Because the Soviet Union's support for the Arab people's demands for national independence greatly hindered the U.S. plot to suppress the Arab national independence movement, making it difficult for the U.S. to realize its ambition to dominate the Middle East. This situation has been particularly prominent recently in the Soviet Union's support for Syria's struggle against the U.S. invasion plot.

Therefore, Dulles attempted to use the UN to put pressure on Syria. Dulles insisted that Syria's patriotic nationalists were so-called "people relying on Moscow," saying that they "are increasingly taking over political power there," and falsely accused them of "being incited by fierce propaganda against their neighbors." Dulles's unscrupulous distortion and interference in Syria's internal affairs were obviously intended to prepare an excuse for U.S. intervention in Syria. In his speech, he also mentioned the "Eisenhower Doctrine" for invading the Middle East and openly threatened to apply this notorious invasion plan to Syria. He also wanted the UN to discuss the situation in Syria. Dulles's purpose was to turn himself from the defendant into the plaintiff, so that the General Assembly would agree to the U.S. invasion plot, thereby legitimizing the U.S.'s criminal act of interfering in Syria.

Dulles's speech nakedly exposed the U.S.'s aggressive ambitions towards Syria and proved the utter hypocrisy of his seemingly "moderate" stance not long ago. This speech also proves that many of the situations that have recently appeared around Syria are preparatory steps for the U.S. to invade Syria.

On Syria's northern front, nine divisions of Turkish troops have been deployed to the Syrian border area. Turkish tanks and armored units are conducting unusual movements on the Syrian-Turkish border. Turkish aircraft are flying reconnaissance missions near the Syrian border. This activity of the Turkish army, carried out under the pretext of so-called "seasonal exercises," which threatens the security of Syria, deserves serious attention.

The situation on Syria's southern front is also quite tense. Israel is holding large-scale military exercises. While this tool of imperialist aggression is flaunting its "strength" to Syria, the government of Jordan, as an Arab country, is launching a massive attack on Syria, falsely accusing Syria's patriotic military leaders of being "hired by the Soviet Union" and insisting that Syria "is preparing to attack sister countries." The Jordanian government also openly called for subversive activities in Syria.

These coordinated actions by Turkey, Israel, and Jordan occurred after the kings of Jordan and Iraq returned to their respective countries. During this period, a so-called "armed conflict" incident occurred on the border between Lebanon and Syria. At the same time, the military exercises of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have also begun. If these situations are linked to the recent intrusion of U.S. aircraft into Egyptian airspace and reconnaissance activities near Alexandria, Egypt, it can be seen that the U.S. is gradually unfolding the plan to invade Syria drafted by conspiracy expert Henderson. Dulles's speech at the UN is also closely coordinated with all these actions.

However, Dulles cannot scare the Syrian people. The Syrian government and people are maintaining a high degree of vigilance against the U.S. invasion plot. Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali announced that all necessary measures have been taken to deal with any unforeseen events. Syrian newspapers also demanded that the people not be deceived and paralyzed by the optimism deliberately spread by U.S. imperialism. This is entirely correct. U.S. imperialism is very insidious and cunning, and it will never give up its plot to suppress the Middle Eastern national independence movement. Dulles's speech has shown this. Therefore, the people of Syria and Egypt, who uphold independence, still face a long and arduous struggle. Any blind optimism or slack emotions will give U.S. imperialism an opportunity to take advantage of and be detrimental to the struggle.

It should be warned again to the likes of Dulles that if the U.S. wants to use the UN to invade Syria like it invaded Korea, then it will suffer an even greater defeat than the invasion of Korea. All countries participating in the UN General Assembly must seriously consider the possible consequences, immediately stop the U.S.'s arrogant ambitions, and not allow the U.S. to use the UN to invade Syria. For those in Turkey, Israel, and Jordan who are willing to serve as tools of aggression for the U.S., they still have a chance to calmly consider the serious and dangerous consequences that this behavior will bring to themselves. As a defender of world peace, the Soviet Union has issued a serious warning to Turkey. This warning also applies to Israel, Jordan, and others who vainly attempt to serve as tools of aggression for the U.S. Our government and people resolutely oppose all U.S. aggressive plots and provocative actions against Syria and express our deep sympathy and support to the Syrian government and people. The aggressive adventures of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East must be stopped. The peace of the Middle East and the world must not be allowed to be undermined by the U.S. If the U.S. and its followers dare to ignite the flames of aggression in Syria, they will surely be resolutely struck by the peace forces of the world. The U.S. and its followers must abandon all侥幸冒(jiǎo xìng mào) reckless adventurous plans and seriously assess the grave meaning of the saying "those who play with fire will be burned."

    不许美国利用联合国侵略叙利亚
    本报评论员
    美国国务卿杜勒斯19日在联合国大会上发表了一篇大肆攻击苏联和叙利亚的演说。这篇演说充分暴露了美国统治集团对于世界和平捍卫者——苏联的仇视和侵略中东、镇压中东民族独立运动的野心。
    杜勒斯在演说中不顾全世界都知道得清清楚楚的事实，竭力歪曲叙利亚国内局势的真相，竟然在联合国大会上不顾联合国宪章原则而公然干涉叙利亚的内政。
    杜勒斯诬蔑苏联支持阿拉伯人民争取独立的政策，把阿拉伯人民的民族主义的正当要求诬蔑为“野心”。杜勒斯这种诬蔑是不足为奇的。因为苏联支持阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的要求，就大大妨碍了美国镇压阿拉伯民族独立运动的阴谋，使得美国独霸中东的野心难以实现。这种情况最近特别突出地表现在苏联支持叙利亚反对美国侵略阴谋的斗争上。
    因此，杜勒斯企图利用联合国来对叙利亚施加压力。杜勒斯硬说叙利亚的爱国的民族主义者是所谓“依靠莫斯科的人”，说他们“愈来愈多地接管了那里的政治权力”，并且诬蔑他们“正在被激烈的宣传煽动起来反对他们的邻居”。杜勒斯这样肆无忌惮地歪曲和干涉叙利亚的内部事务，显然是为了给美国干涉叙利亚准备借口。他在演说中又提到了侵略中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且公然威胁要应用这个臭名远扬的侵略计划来对付叙利亚。他还要联合国来讨论叙利亚的局势。杜勒斯的目的是要把自己由被告变为原告，使联大同意美国的侵略阴谋，从而使美国干涉叙利亚的犯罪行为合法化。
    杜勒斯这篇演说，赤裸裸地暴露了美国对叙利亚的侵略野心，同时证明了他不久以前装模作样的所谓“温和”姿态的彻底虚伪。这篇演说也证明了最近在叙利亚周围出现的许多情况，是美国侵略叙利亚的准备步骤。
    在叙利亚的北线，土耳其军队九个师已经开到叙利亚边境地区。土耳其的坦克和装甲部队在叙、土边境上进行不平常的调动。土耳其的飞机在叙利亚边境附近飞行侦察。土耳其军队在所谓“季节性演习”的借口下进行的这种威胁叙利亚安全的活动，值得严重注意。
    在叙利亚的南线上，形势也相当紧张。以色列正在举行大规模的军事演习。而正当这个帝国主义的侵略工具在向叙利亚炫耀它的“实力”的时候，作为阿拉伯国家之一的约旦的政府，却竟然对叙利亚大肆攻击，诬蔑叙利亚的爱国的军事领袖是所谓“受苏联雇用的”，并且硬说叙利亚“在准备进攻姐妹国家”。约旦政府并且公然号召在叙利亚进行颠覆活动。
    土耳其、以色列、约旦这种互相配合的行动，是在约旦和伊拉克国王分别回国以后发生的。在这期间，黎巴嫩和叙利亚边境上又发生了所谓“武装冲突”事件。同时，北大西洋集团的军事演习也已经开始。如果把这些情况同美国飞机最近侵入埃及领空和在埃及亚历山大港附近进行侦察活动等等情况联系起来，就可以看出美国正在一步一步地展开阴谋专家汉德逊所拟定的侵略叙利亚的计划。而杜勒斯在联大的演说，又是同所有这些行动密切配合着的。
    但是，杜勒斯是吓不倒叙利亚人民的。叙利亚政府和人民对于美国的侵略阴谋保持着高度的警惕。叙利亚总理阿萨利宣布已经采取一切必要措施来对付任何不测事件。叙利亚的报纸也要求人民不要被美帝国主义故意散布的乐观情绪所欺骗和麻痹。这是完全正确的。美国帝国主义是十分阴险和狡猾的，它镇压中东民族独立运动的阴谋是决不会放弃的。杜勒斯的演说已经表明了这一点。因此，在坚持独立的叙利亚和埃及人民面前，还有着长期艰苦的斗争。任何盲目乐观、麻痹松懈的情绪，都将给美帝国主义以可乘之机而不利于斗争。
    应当再次警告杜勒斯之流，如果美国要想像侵略朝鲜那样利用联合国来侵略叙利亚，那末它就会遭到比侵略朝鲜更大的失败。参加联合国大会的所有国家，都必须严重地考虑到可能的后果，立即制止美国的狂妄野心，不许美国利用联合国来侵略叙利亚。对于土耳其、以色列、约旦的那些甘心给美国充当侵略工具的人来说，他们现在还有机会冷静地考虑一下他们这种行为将会给自己带来怎样严重而且危险的后果。苏联作为世界和平的捍卫者，向土耳其提出了严重的警告。这个警告当然也适用于以色列、约旦以及其他妄想替美国充当侵略工具的人。我国政府和人民坚决反对美国对叙利亚的一切侵略阴谋和挑衅行动，并且对叙利亚政府和人民表示深切的同情和支持。美帝国主义在中东的侵略冒险必须予以制止。中东和世界的和平决不容许美国破坏。如果美国和它的追随者们胆敢在叙利亚烧起侵略的战火，它们就一定要遭到全世界和平力量的坚决的打击。美国和它的追随者们必须放弃一切侥幸冒险的打算，认真估量“玩火者必自焚”这句话的严重意义。
