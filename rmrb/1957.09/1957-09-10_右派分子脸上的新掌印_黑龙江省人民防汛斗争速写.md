New Handprints on the Faces of the Rightists
    ——A Quick Sketch of the Flood Control Struggle in Heilongjiang Province
    By Our Correspondent Miao Feng
    Now, the water level of the Songhua River has risen to 120.29 meters, exceeding the warning level by 0.79 meters. However, Harbin still stands tall on the riverbank, and people can't help but marvel at this miracle. The middle-aged people in this city clearly remember that in 1932, when the water level only rose to 119.72 meters, more than 100,000 of Harbin's 400,000 people were displaced, homeless, and begging on the streets. Afterwards, many people were deprived of their lives by diseases, and many prostrated themselves on the riverbank, crying sadly for their loved ones... The accumulated water in the city turned from yellow to green, emitting a foul odor. In those days of deep suffering, the broad masses of the people struggled on the edge of death, while those officials, wives, masters, and bosses continued to live a life of extravagance and debauchery.
    However, after the Communist Party led the people to achieve liberation, the situation became very different. In 1956, the Songhua River water level in Harbin rose to 120.06 meters, and 930,000 hectares of land in the province were destroyed and waterlogged, but despite such a serious disaster, there were no disaster victims in Harbin. From their own experiences, the people concluded that "with the Communist Party, there is victory." Under the severe threat of this extraordinary flood, people were so firm and full of confidence. Isn't this because the Party gave them the courage and confidence to overcome the flood? The personnel of the flood control headquarters at all levels spent many sleepless nights, and the leading comrades of the Party and government at all levels often patrolled the river embankments, working and fighting alongside everyone. Ren Zhongyi, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, Lü Qien, Mayor, and other comrades, had bloodshot eyes, and they considered it a great luxury to take a nap in the car. Hundreds of Party and Youth League branches on the flood control front led Party and League members, driving tens of thousands of people. When danger was discovered, Party and League members were the first to jump into the water and use their bodies to block the huge waves; on the slippery embankment slopes, when the grass bags could not be carried up, Party and League members took the lead, crawling on all fours to transport the earth bags. Their knees were worn and torn, and some Party members continued to work even after coughing up blood; in the rescue efforts, female Party members Hu Peilan, Zhang Zaiqing and others took the lead in shoveling mud into the grass bags with their hands... In just two days, the dikes in the suburban areas of the city, stretching over two hundred miles, were generally raised to 121.70 meters. The Party's concern for the people, the heroic actions of Party and League members, cannot be fully described or written, and the people will always remember these outstanding sons and daughters. People saw such moving scenes: some old people brought clothes to the embankment, tightly wrapping up the young men and women who had just climbed out of the water, shivering with cold: "Warm up, children." Some old people fed those who were frozen numb spoonful by spoonful of ginger water... People, when you see this battle of general mobilization of all the people, what will you think? The rightists said that these responsible cadres of the Party are a privileged class, Party members are people who stand on the heads of the people, and Youth League members and activists are people who are trying to climb up. They said menacingly that "the people" want to kill the Communist Party. However, the actual actions of the broad masses of the people gave the rightists a resounding slap in the face. The people of Heilongjiang Province are united wholeheartedly around the Party, working hard with full confidence to win the great victory in overcoming the flood! New handprints have been added to the faces of the rightists. (Attached picture)

    右派分子脸上的新掌印
    ——黑龙江省人民防汛斗争速写
    本报记者　苗风
    现在，松花江水位已经上涨到120.29公尺，超过警戒水位0.79公尺了。然而哈尔滨仍巍然屹立江岸，人们不能不为这奇迹赞叹。这座城市的中年人都清楚记得，1932年的水位仅仅涨到119．72公尺，四十多万人口的哈尔滨就有十多万人流离失所，无家可归，沿街乞讨。事后，多少人被疾病夺去了生命，多少人俯在江堤上伤心地哭泣亲人……市内的积水由黄变绿，发出恶腥的臭味。在那些灾难深重的日子里，广大人民在死亡的边沿挣扎着，而那些长官、太太、老爷、老板们却照样过着花天酒地的生活。
    可是，当共产党领导人民获得解放以后，情况可就大不相同了。1956年，哈尔滨市的松花江水位，上涨到120.06公尺，全省有九十三万公顷土地被冲毁和内涝，但是这样严重的灾荒，哈尔滨市却没有灾民。人民从亲身经历中，得出了“有共产党就有胜利”的结论。在这次特大洪水的严重威胁下，人们是那样坚定和充满了信心。这不正是因为党给了他战胜洪水的勇气和信心吗？各级防汛指挥部的人员，渡过多少个不眠的夜晚，各级党、政领导同志们，常常巡视在江堤上，和大家一起劳动，一起抢险。哈尔滨市委书记任仲夷、市长吕其恩等同志，眼睛熬得血丝条条，他们在汽车上打个盹，就算很幸福地睡了一觉。防洪战线上的几百个党、团支部，领导着党、团员，带动了成千上万的人。发现险情，首先是党、团员跳下水去，用身体挡住巨浪；在泥滑的堤坡上，草袋运不上去，是党、团员们带头，用四肢爬行运送土袋。他们膝盖上磨破了皮肉，有的党员吐血以后，还不肯休息；在抢险中，是女党员胡佩兰、张再清等带头用手往草袋里扒泥……在短短的两天里，二百多里的市郊区堤坝普遍加高到121.70公尺了。党对人民的关怀，党、团员的英雄行为，说不完，写不尽，人民是永远记得这些优秀儿女的。人们看到了这样令人感动的场面：有的老人抱着衣服到堤坝上来，紧紧裹住刚从水里爬上来冷得发抖的小伙子和姑娘：“暖一暖吧，孩子。”有的老人给冻得麻木的人一调羹一调羹地喂生姜水……。人们，当你看到这一场全体人民总动员的战斗时，会有什么感想呢？右派分子们说，这些党的负责干部是特权阶级、党员是站在人民头上的人、共青团员和积极分子是企图向上爬的人。他们杀气腾腾地说“人民”要杀共产党。然而，人民群众的实际行动却给了右派分子一记响亮的耳光。黑龙江省人民一心一意地团结在党的周围，满怀信心地努力争取战胜洪水的伟大胜利！右派分子们的脸上又添上了新的掌印。（附图片）
