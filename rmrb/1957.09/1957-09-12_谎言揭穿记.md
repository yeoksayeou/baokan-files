A Lie Exposed
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Meng Fan

On September 10th, at the second session of the Second Tianjin Municipal People's Congress, a representative powerfully refuted the "Lin Bijin Incident," which rightist Yang Jishi used to attack the Communist Party, with factual evidence. His speech was met with enthusiastic applause time and again. This representative was none other than Lin Bijin himself, the director of the Otolaryngology Department of Tianjin First Central Hospital.

The "Lin Bijin Incident," which rightist Yang Jishi, the vice president of Tianjin First Central Hospital, relied upon, occurred in 1951. At that time, he was working simultaneously at Tianjin Enguang Hospital and People's Hospital. At 11:00 AM on September 29th, Lin Bijin performed a mastoidectomy on the only son of an old worker at Enguang Hospital. At 5:00 PM, Lin went to Beijing for personal reasons. After returning to Tianjin late the next night, he discovered that the patient had contracted tetanus, and the patient died within a few days. This incident aroused strong condemnation from all walks of life against Lin Bijin. In order to educate the broad masses of medical personnel, the People's Court sentenced Lin Bijin to six months of labor, with a suspended sentence. Five years later, at a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in May of this year, rightist Yang Jishi spoke up for the "Lin Bijin Incident," saying: "The Party did not consult expert appraisals, and technical judgments focused on political angles, ignoring the truth." He also used this incident to slander the Communist Party for "persecuting" medical personnel "too severely," turning them into "an oppressed class," and causing "doctors to be unwilling to see patients." After Yang Jishi's lies were published in the newspaper, some rightist elements in the medical community clamored that the government's handling of Lin Bijin was a blow to medical personnel; some people who were unaware of the truth were also once deceived and expressed doubts about the government's handling.

When Lin Bijin spoke about his understanding of this incident at the meeting, he firmly said: "This incident is by no means a blow to medical personnel by the government, but rather reflects the attitude of some medical personnel at the time of looking down on workers' children, being indifferent to patients' lives, and being extremely irresponsible." He said that when the incident first occurred, his understanding was also vague. Later, after the appraisal by the Otolaryngology Appraisal Committee and the analysis and help of medical professionals, he realized that the main mistake was that for such a serious patient, he actually left without concern on the same day after performing the surgery; in particular, the president of Tianjin Medical College, Zhu Xianyi, pointed out, "If your child had surgery, would you go to Beijing?" He said that these words caused him strong self-reproach.

Lin Bijin said that after this incident, the government was still very concerned about his work and life. He said that he had worked in the People's Hospital (formerly Ma Daifu Hospital) for six years, and there was always only one doctor in the Otolaryngology Department; however, after this incident occurred, the government equipped him with assistants, and the number of beds also increased from six to thirty. After the otolaryngology departments of several hospitals merged into the First Central Hospital, there was a dedicated building, and now the number of doctors in the department has increased to more than a dozen, the number of beds has increased to more than seventy, and the necessary medical equipment is also complete. In the past, he rode a bicycle to and from work every day, but later the hospital provided a car to pick him up and drop him off every day. In the summer of 1953, the government also invited his entire family to Beidaihe for summer vacation.

Regarding the argument spread by rightist Yang Jishi that the "Lin Bijin Incident" was a blow to medical personnel and that doctors were unwilling to see patients, Lin Bijin also refuted it with his own work situation. He said that through the "Lin Bijin Incident," the sense of responsibility of medical personnel was strengthened, and their enthusiasm was also improved. He himself rarely performed major surgeries in the past. Delicate and complex surgeries like "inner ear fenestration," which he might not have done once in the past few years, are now done more often. A few months ago, the total laryngectomy and bilateral cervical lymph node dissection he performed on two patients with "laryngeal cancer" were also very successful. He said that in his work, he never thought of being afraid to take bold responsibility because of past mistakes. Of course, he is now very cautious when performing surgery. But for a doctor who is healing the wounded, rescuing the dying, and serving the working people, isn't that what should be done?

Lin Bijin finally said that when he first saw Yang Jishi's fallacy, he thought that Yang Jishi usually liked to scold people, had a bad personality, and that opposing the Communist Party was only a matter of thought. After the anti-rightist struggle unfolded, he realized that Yang Jishi intentionally used the "Lin Bijin Incident" to provoke the relationship between medical personnel and the Communist Party. It was not a personality problem at all, but a political problem of standing on a reactionary position. He said that it is a fact that Yang Jishi likes to scold people, but he only scolds the Communist Party, not the democratic parties; he only scolds the Soviet Union, but not the United States; he only scolds socialism, but not capitalism. Yang Jishi's scolding also has a clear reactionary stance.

　　谎言揭穿记
　　新华社记者　孟帆
    9月10日，在天津市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议的讲坛上，一位代表以有力的事实揭穿了右派分子杨济时攻击共产党所依据的“林必锦事件”的谎言。他的发言一次又一次地获得了热烈的掌声。这个代表就是林必锦本人，天津市第一中心医院耳鼻喉科主任。
    右派分子、天津市第一中心医院副院长杨济时所依据的“林必锦事件”是在1951年发生的。当时他同时在天津恩光医院和人民医院工作。9月29日上午十一点，林必锦在恩光医院为一个老工人的独生子动了乳突凿开手术。下午五点林就因私事去北京。第二天夜半他回天津后，发现病人患了破伤风，不数日这个病人就死亡了。这件事当时引起了各界人士对林必锦的严正谴责，人民法院为了教育广大医务人员，曾判处林必锦劳役半年，缓期执行。五年过去了，右派分子杨济时在今年5月中共天津市委统战部召开的座谈会上为“林必锦事件”叫屈，他说：“党没有经过专家们的鉴定，对于技术判断着重于政治角度，而忽视了事实真相。”他还依据这个事件诬蔑共产党把医务人员“整得太厉害了”，“成了被压迫的阶级”，“医生都不愿看病”。杨济时的谎言在报上登出以后，医务界的一些右派分子就叫嚷政府对林必锦的处理是对医务人员的打击；一些不明真相的人也一度被蒙蔽，对政府的处理表示怀疑。
    林必锦在会上讲到他对于这个事件的认识时，坚定地说：“这个事件决不是政府对医务人员的打击，而是反映出当时医务人员中存在的轻视工人子弟，对病人生命漠不关心，极端不负责任的作风。”他说，当事件刚发生的时候，他的认识也是模糊的。后来耳鼻喉科鉴定委员会的鉴定以及医务界人士的分析和帮助，他才认识到主要的错误是对于这样重的病人，动了手术后，当天竟离开而不顾；特别是天津医学院院长朱宪彝指出的“如果你的孩子动了手术，你去不去北京？”他说，这一席话曾引起他强烈的自疚。
    林必锦说，这事件以后，政府对他的工作和生活还是十分关心的。他说，他原来在人民医院（前为马大夫医院）工作了六年，耳鼻喉科始终只有他一个大夫；可是这事件发生后，政府给他配备了助手，床位也由六个增加到三十个。当几个医院的耳鼻喉科合并到第一中心医院以后，有了一所专用的楼房，现在科内大夫增加到十几个人，床位也增加到七十多个，需要的医疗器械也齐备了。过去，他每天上下班骑自行车，后来医院每天用汽车接送。1953年夏天，政府又请他全家到北戴河去避暑。
    对于右派分子杨济时散布的“林必锦事件”打击了医务人员，医生都不愿看病的论调，林必锦也以他自己的工作情况做了批驳。他说，通过“林必锦事件”医务人员的责任心加强了，积极性也提高了。他自己对于从前很少做的大手术，像“内耳开窗”这样细致复杂的手术，过去几年不见得做一次，现在也做得多了。几个月以前，他为两个患“喉头癌瘤”的病人做的喉全切除术及双侧颈部淋巴清除术，也很成功。他说，在工作中，他从来没有想到因过去犯错误而不敢大胆负责。当然，现在动手术都是非常慎重的。但是这对一个救死扶伤，为劳动人民服务的医生来说，难道不是应当的吗？
    林必锦最后说到，他初看到杨济时的谬论以为杨济时平时即好骂人，个性不好，反对共产党只是思想问题。在反右派斗争展开以后，他认识到杨济时是有意以“林必锦事件”挑拨医务人员和共产党的关系，完全不是什么个性问题，而是站在反动立场的政治问题。他说，杨济时好骂人是事实，但是只骂共产党，不骂民主党派；只骂苏联，而不骂美国；只骂社会主义，而不骂资本主义。杨济时的骂也是有明确的反动立场的。
