This newspaper Nanjing, September 17th dispatch (Reporter Zhang Jing) reports: Sixty-four factories in seven cities of Jiangsu Province, namely Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Nantong, Xuzhou and Xin Hai Lian, have started rectification campaigns and socialist education movements one after another.

These factories are checking while rectifying and correcting, and at the same time mobilizing the masses to fully express their opinions, creating a particularly strong democratic atmosphere. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 10,000 opinions have been put forward by the factories. In three days, the Nanjing Electronic Tube Factory posted nearly a hundred big-character posters and cartoons, some of which exposed the fact that the factory's financial accounting section had not verified the number of employees on duty for a month and mistakenly paid wages to those who had left the company. In Wuxi, the first five factories to undergo rectification have posted more than 900 big-character posters in a week. In order to better eliminate the concerns of the masses, the factories have generally adopted the forms of seminars and individual interviews. Cheng Guocui, the Party Committee Secretary of Changzhou Dacheng No. 1 Factory, specifically visited the staff of the office to solicit criticism. Tao Zhenhui, the director of the former spinning workshop, expressed his long-buried opinions after the conversation.

At the same time, the Party committees of some factories led the workers in debates on the two roads. For example, the Wuxi Lixin Yarn Factory mobilized workers to debate issues such as "Why is socialism good? Why is capitalism bad?", "How to consolidate the socialist system" and democracy and centralism. Through debate, right and wrong were distinguished, and the socialist consciousness of the workers was greatly improved. Now, the phenomenon of disobeying administrative orders and violating labor discipline has been basically eliminated, and the absenteeism rate has been reduced by one-third. Production in the factories has not only not been hindered, but the production plans of some factories have been completed even better. For example, the Changzhou Dacheng No. 2 Factory launched a competition among classes, groups and workshops throughout the factory. The staff of the dyeing workshop took a series of measures to address production problems, and as a result, not a single defective product was produced out of more than 8,000 pieces of plain khaki produced in six days, creating a new record for excellent quality.

　　江苏省六十四个工厂开始整风
    本报南京17日电　记者张竞报道：江苏省南京、无锡、苏州、常州、南通、徐州、新海连七个市已共有六十四个工厂先后开始整风和进行社会主义教育运动。
    这些厂正在一面检查边整边改的情况，一面发动群众大鸣大放，工厂的民主气氛特别浓厚。据不完全统计，各厂已经提出的意见已有近万条以上。南京电子管厂三天内贴出了近百张大字报和漫画，其中有人揭发了该厂财务会计科，有一个月没有核实在职人数，误给离职人员发了工资的事实。无锡第一批整风的五个工厂，一周来已经贴出九百多张大字报。为了更好地消除群众顾虑，各厂普遍采用了座谈会和个别访问的形式。常州大成一厂党委书记成国粹特地访问了科室人员，征求批评意见。前纺车间主任陶振挥在谈话后，把长期埋在心里的意见提了出来。
    与此同时，有些厂党委领导工人进行了关于两条道路的争辩。如无锡丽新纱厂发动工人对“社会主义为什么好？资本主义为什么不好？”“怎样巩固社会主义制度”及民主与集中等问题展开了辩论。经过辩论，分清了是非，大大提高了工人的社会主义觉悟。现在不服从行政指挥，违犯劳动纪律的现象基本上消除了，缺勤率减少了三分之一。各厂的生产不仅不受到阻碍，而且有些厂的生产计划完成得更好。如常州大成二厂在全厂掀起了班与班、组与组、车间与车间的竞赛。染色车间职工对生产上的问题采取了一系列的措施，因而在六天生产的八千多匹元色卡其布，没有一匹次品，创造了质量优良的新纪录。
