Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Forty state-owned factories and mines in the capital are implementing the spirit of rectifying while simultaneously making improvements, launching a large-scale upsurge in improvement work.

	This upsurge occurred immediately after the Party committees of various factories and mines reported to the workers' representative assembly or the general assembly of all workers in their respective factories. As of the 13th, the Party committees of all forty state-owned factories and mines in the city had reported on the progress of the rectification movement and how to improve work. From the hundreds of thousands of opinions raised by the workers, they sorted out and summarized more than 15,000 problems, listed them as the first batch of problems to be solved, and decided to solve them in the near future. Other issues will be handled in batches subsequently.

	When making their reports, the Party committees of various factories and mines announced to the workers item by item the problems listed as the first batch to be solved, the solutions, and the persons responsible for solving the problems. Some factories and mines even printed it into booklets and distributed them to worker representatives, while others posted them in the form of big-character posters. As soon as these booklets and big-character posters were distributed or posted, they immediately attracted the attention of the vast majority of workers, who were eager to see them first. They praised this rectification campaign as "short in flowering, quick in bearing fruit." Workers who saw their opinions listed in the "first batch" were even more excited. They told everyone they met: My opinion has been included in the "first batch"!

	In the past few days, large and small problems have been solved every day in various factories and mines. In the Qinghua workshop of the Beijing No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory, manual removal of floor waste had been used for a long time. Each cleaning was dusty and harmful to the workers' health. Workers had made many suggestions in the past, but they were not resolved. This time, the Party committee accepted the workers' opinions in the report and quickly tried to assemble a machine for removing floor waste using some machine parts. The factory director personally led the workers in installing and testing the machine. The entire factory's workers spread the word about this as good news. Many blackboards in the factory reported on this matter, and the blackboard in the Qinghua workshop used eye-catching large characters written in red chalk: "Our Great Happy Event." In the electroplating workshop of the passenger car workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, some plated parts had to be sent outside for processing for more than two years due to insufficient manpower. The quality of the work was not up to standard, which affected the completion of the production plan. Recently, according to the opinions of the workers, the factory leaders transferred electroplating workers from other departments of the factory, and the problem was solved. Old worker Wang Jifeng said excitedly: "Watch, the quality of every plated part we make in the future must be very good." Now, in addition to organizing forces to solve the first batch of problems, the Party committees of various factories and mines have simultaneously assigned special personnel to begin sorting out and studying solutions for the second batch of problems.

	Many factories and mines generally implemented the principle of diligence and thrift in running enterprises when solving problems. The Beijing Municipal Telephone Bureau's Second Branch Bureau had too few trunk lines, resulting in low call quality, and users had many complaints. In solving this problem, the bureau's leading cadres and relevant staff members studied and used waste materials from the warehouse to install forty pairs of trunk lines, which was equivalent to 15% of all the trunk lines in the branch bureau. In this way, a major problem was solved without spending much money.

	To date, workers in the forty state-owned factories and mines in the capital have raised more than 500,000 opinions. How to quickly and effectively deal with these opinions has become a very important issue at present. In practice, some factories and mines have already created experience in solving this problem. In the past, the heat treatment workshop of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory lacked tools, and workers could only grab workpieces from the furnace with gloves, and would burn their hands if they were not careful. When solving this problem, the factory's leading cadres adopted the method of taking the mass line. From the beginning, they sought the opinions of the workshop director, veteran masters, and some workers to discuss and study, and proposed the method of finding waste materials and making fire hooks by themselves. On September 12, the workshop workers, led by the workshop director and veteran masters, worked together to make fifteen fire hooks out of discarded steel bars, and solved the problem in less than half a day. The factory was inspired by this incident. After putting forward the first batch of problems to be solved, they immediately convened a forum of veteran workers to solicit opinions; various workshops and departments also invited relevant personnel from all parties to jointly study and solve problems. The factory is also preparing to solicit opinions from those who raised the issues again before announcing the solutions to the second batch of problems.

	As the first batch of problems are gradually solved, some new atmospheres have begun to appear within the factories and mines. The relationship between the Party and the masses has been further strengthened. Wang Yongnian, a worker in the machine repair workshop of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, used to have opinions on Zhao Zhenyi, the workshop director and a Communist Party member, and always wanted to leave the workshop. During the rectification, he saw that Zhao Zhenyi humbly accepted everyone's opinions and was very moved. Recently, he said to the organization committee member of the workshop Party branch that he could see from this rectification that Lao Zhao was still a good comrade. I am stubborn and inflexible, and I also have shortcomings in my relationship with Lao Zhao. I will no longer want to leave the workshop in the future. Recently, he and Zhao Zhenyi have had a very good relationship and often study production issues together. Some people in the workshop who were relatively alienated from the Party in the past have now become closer. They said: Now, from the bottom of my heart, I feel that the Party is good. The labor enthusiasm of the vast majority of workers has also increased even more than before. Many factories and mines have launched a production upsurge to complete or exceed the September production plan ahead of schedule to greet National Day.

	In addition to hoping that the factory and mine Party committees will continue to accept correct opinions, many workers have also raised some issues, requesting debate. Some workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have raised issues based on the factory's specific situation, such as how the factory's organization can further meet the requirements of socialist enterprises, whether the apprenticeship period should be extended, whether it is reasonable to receive salary during sick leave based on the average salary of the previous three months, and whether housing, water, and electricity should be charged according to national standards, requesting that the factory Party committee organize debates with leadership at an appropriate time.

　　首都四十个国营厂矿边整边改
　　掀起规模巨大的改进工作的高潮
　　工人们称赞这次整风“开花短，结果快”
    新华社14日讯  首都四十个国营厂矿企业贯彻边整边改精神，正在掀起一个规模巨大的改进工作的高潮。
    这个高潮是紧接在各厂矿企业的党委会向本厂职工代表大会或全体职工大会作了报告以后出现的。到13日为止，全市四十个国营厂矿企业的党委会都已经就整风运动的进展情况和如何改进工作的问题作了报告。他们从职工提出的几十万条意见中，整理、归纳出了一万五千多个问题，列为第一批要解决的问题，决定在最近时期内予以解决。其他问题将随后分批处理。
    各厂矿企业的党委会在做报告的时候，都把列为第一批要解决的问题及其解决办法、解决问题的负责人等逐项在职工中公布。有些厂矿企业还把它打印成册，发给职工代表，有些单位用大字报公布出来。这些小册子和大字报刚一分发或张贴，就立即吸引住广大职工莫不以先睹为快。他们称赞这次整风“开花短，结果快”。看到自己提的意见被列入“第一批”的工人，更是兴奋万分，他们逢人便说：我提的意见被列入“第一批”了！
    最近几天，各厂矿企业中每天都有大大小小的问题在解决。国营北京第一棉纺织厂清花车间长期用人工清除地弄花，每次清除时都是尘土飞扬，妨害工人的健康，过去工人提了很多意见没有解决。这次，党委会在报告中接受了工人们的意见，很快就设法用一些机器的部件装配成一部清除地弄花的机器，厂长亲自领导工人安装和试验机器。全厂职工把这件事当成喜讯传开了。厂内很多黑板报报道了这件事，清花车间的黑板报上用红粉笔写着非常醒目的大字标题：“我们的大喜事”。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂客车车间电镀室，两年多来，因人手不够，有些镀件都拿到外边去做，做的不合乎质量标准，影响了生产计划的完成。最近厂里领导方面根据职工意见，从本厂别的部门调来了电镀工人，问题就解决了。老工人王及凤兴奋地说：“瞧着吧，今后我们每个镀件的质量都一定要使它很好。”现在各厂矿企业的党委除了组织力量分组解决第一批问题以外，有些厂矿的党委并同时委派专人，开始着手整理和研究第二批问题的解决方案。
    许多厂矿企业在解决问题的时候，一般都贯彻执行了勤俭办企业的方针。北京市市内电话第二分局中继线太少，通话质量低，用户很有意见。在这次解决问题中，局的领导干部和有关工作人员研究，利用仓库废料增装了四十对中继线，等于分局全部中继线的15％，这样没花多少钱就解决了一个重大的问题。
    到目前为止，首都这四十个国营厂矿企业的职工提出的意见已经有五十多万条。怎样迅速有效地处理这些意见，就成为当前一个很重要的问题。在实践中，有些厂矿企业已经创造了解决这个问题的经验。北京第一机床厂热处理车间，以前由于缺乏工具，工人只戴着手套从炉里往外抓工作物，一不小心就会把手烧坏。厂里领导干部在解决这个问题的时候，采取了走群众路线的方法，一开始就找车间主任、老师傅和一些工人共同讨论研究，提出了找废料自己动手打火钩子的办法。9月12日，车间工人在车间主任和老师傅的带领下，一起动手，用废弃的钢筋作出了十五把火钩子，在不到半天的时间内就把这个问题解决了。这个厂从这件事中得到启示，他们在提出第一批要解决的问题以后，就立即召开老工人座谈会，征求意见；各车间各部门也邀请各方面的有关人员共同研究解决问题。厂里还准备在公布第二批问题的解决方案以前，普遍向提意见的人征求一次意见。
    随着第一批问题逐步得到解决，厂矿企业内部开始出现了一些新的气象。党和群众的关系进一步密切了。北京第一机床厂机修车间工人王永年过去对车间主任、共产党员赵振义有意见，老想离开这个车间。整风中他看到赵振义虚心接受大家意见，心里非常感动。最近他向车间党支部的组织委员说，从这次整风中看出，老赵还是个好同志，我是石头脑瓜子、死心眼，同老赵的关系我也有不对的地方，今后我再不想离开车间了。最近他和赵振义的关系很好，经常一起研究生产上的问题。车间里过去有些对党比较疏远的人，现在也亲近起来了，他们说：现在从心眼里感到党好。广大职工的劳动积极性也较前更加高涨。很多厂矿企业都掀起了提前超额完成9月份生产计划迎接国庆节的生产高潮。
    各厂矿企业的职工现在除了希望厂矿党委继续接受正确的意见以外，很多人还提出了一些问题，要求进行辩论。石景山钢铁厂的有些职工根据厂里具体情况，已经提出了工厂机构如何进一步适合社会主义企业的要求、学徒工学习年限是否应当延长、病假期间按前三个月的平均工资领薪是否合理、住房和用水用电应不应该按照国家标准收费等问题，要求工厂党委在适当时机有领导地组织辩论。
