Hanoi dispatch: The Phan zone, covering more than 300 square kilometers in Bac Ninh Province north of Hanoi, has completely returned to normal. More than 60,000 Vietnamese mu (each Vietnamese mu is equivalent to more than 5 Chinese mu) of autumn rice in this zone have been planted with seedlings.

The Phan zone in Bac Ninh Province was flooded due to the breach of the "Mei Lin Sluice" on the Dun River. The floodwaters poured into the flooded area from the breach on July 11 and gradually receded only after the breach was blocked on July 31. During the nearly one month of flooding, thanks to the active rescue and proper arrangements made by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, more than 200,000 people in the flooded area safely survived the disaster, except for 43 people who died from swimming or capsizing. After the breach was blocked, the government put forward the slogan "Plant wherever the water recedes" and actively led the masses to rush to plant autumn rice. At present, the Phan zone is a lush green, and the rice growing on the fertile alluvial soil rolls in the wind, making it hard to believe that this place was submerged by turbulent floodwaters a month ago.

The funds donated by the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries have been effectively used by the government of the Democratic Republic to help the people in the Phan zone solve their difficulties in life and production. Three hundred and nine households, comprising one thousand one hundred and eighteen people, received 27,765 kilograms of relief grain; some farmers lacking seedlings also received seedlings. During the flood, Mei Lin Commune, which bore the brunt of the disaster, had more than 300 mu of farmland covered by sand and unable to grow autumn rice. The government's agricultural and forestry departments sent specialists to help farmers study the possibility of growing peanuts and other crops instead.

### 越南北宁省泛区恢复正常  六万多亩秋稻都插上了秧

    越南北宁省泛区恢复正常
    六万多亩秋稻都插上了秧
    本报河内航讯　河内以北北宁省三百多平方公里的泛区，已经完全恢复正常状态，这个区里的六万多越亩（每越亩等于中国五亩多）秋稻也都插上了秧。
    北宁省泛区，是由于敦河上的“梅林水闸”决口造成的。洪水自7月11日从决口处源源涌进泛区，直到7月31日堵口后才逐渐退去。在被洪水淹没将近一个月的时间里，由于越南民主共和国政府进行了积极的抢救和妥善的安排，泛区里除四十三人或因游泳或因翻船牺牲外，二十多万人民都安全地度过了灾期。当决口堵住后，政府又提出“水退到那里种到那里”的口号，积极领导群众抢种秋稻。目前泛区里一片葱绿，生长在肥沃的冲积土上的稻子随风翻滚，使人难以相信这里一个月前曾被浊浪滚滚的洪水淹没过。
    苏联、中国以及其他兄弟国家捐赠的款项，已被民主共和国政府有效地用来帮助泛区人民解决生活和生产上的困难。有三百零九户、一千一百一十八人领到二万七千七百六十五公斤救济粮；还有一些缺乏秧苗的农户得到了秧苗。水灾期间，首当其冲的梅林社，有三百多亩田因为被沙子盖没不能种秋稻，政府农林部门派专人下去帮助农民研究改种落花生等其他作物。
