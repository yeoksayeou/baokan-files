    The Final Sprint
    Wu Lü
    In the recent National Swimming and Diving Championships, a wonderful scene occurred in the women's 100-meter freestyle: When only three meters from the finish line, Dai Lihua, an athlete from the Shanghai team, surged forward, overtaking Chen Huiying, an athlete from the People's Liberation Army who was ahead of her, and snatched the gold medal. The audience praised Dai Lihua for being a worthy famous athlete, adept at using the final sprint to beat her opponents; others regretted that Chen Huiying did not seize the final moment and failed at the last hurdle.
    The distance of three meters is only one second in a swimming competition. However, in that one second, an experienced athlete can still use the final sprint to overtake an opponent who has already gained an advantage. Even if it is only one second, for those who want to achieve something, there is still much that can be done.
    I believe that the spirit of the athletes who do not relax for even a second and still make a final sprint is very worthy of learning for cadres in the basic construction departments.
    Every year, the progress of basic construction is sometimes unsatisfactory. This year is no exception. From January to July, only 41.3% of the annual basic construction investment was completed nationwide. How August went is not yet clear. Now, there are only four months left until the end of the year. Whether the annual basic construction plan can be completed, and the success of the basic construction tasks in the first Five-Year Plan, all depends on these last four months. However, the feeling towards these "last four months" is very different among some basic construction cadres compared to the average person.
    Some comrades are viewing these last four months with negative emotions. They feel that most of the year has passed, only four months are left in the Five-Year Plan, and there are still difficulties in the supply of raw materials and equipment, the Rectification Campaign and socialist education will take time, and there are many problems in the work. It seems that the failure to complete the basic construction plan is a foregone conclusion, the situation is irreversible, and any further effort is futile. This negative emotion is obviously harmful. However, some comrades are exactly the opposite, viewing these last four months with blind optimism. They feel that this year's task is not large, there are still four months left, and it is okay to proceed slowly. Optimism is good, but blind optimism, failing to see the problems in the work, and not doing the work practically, is also harmful to the completion of the plan.
    Four months is not very long, but not very short either. For those who want to achieve something, there is still something that can be done. It is hoped that cadres in the basic construction departments will criticize both negative and blindly optimistic emotions, and in these last four months, with the spirit of athletes making a final sprint in the competition, add some fuel and accelerate the progress. As long as there is such a sprint, the progress of basic construction will definitely accelerate. The construction enterprises in Taiyuan City are an example. The construction enterprises in this city only completed an average of 25.7% of the annual plan in the first half of the year. In late June, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China took emergency measures, and all construction enterprises criticized negative emotions and strengthened work in all aspects, making a sprint. As a result, in July, all twenty-seven construction enterprises in the city overfulfilled the plan by 16.7%.
    Of course, in this final sprint, attention should also be paid to quality, saving, and safety.

    最后的冲刺
    吴滤
    最近举行的全国游泳、跳水锦标比赛中，女子一百公尺自由泳出现了一个精采的场面：在距离终点只有三公尺的时候，上海队的运动员戴丽华一冲而上，赶过了游在她前面的解放军运动员陈慧英，夺走了金质奖章。观众们有赞赏戴丽华不愧运动名将、善于用最后的冲刺赛过对手的；也有为陈慧英没有抓紧最后的时间、功败垂成而惋惜的。
    三公尺的距离，在游泳比赛中只是一秒钟的时间。可是，在一秒钟的时间里，富有比赛经验的运动员还可以用最后的冲刺，赶过已取得优势的对手。可是那怕只是一秒钟的时间，对于欲有所为的人说来，还是大有可为的。
    运动员们这种不放松一秒钟的时间，还要作最后冲刺的精神，我以为，倒是很值得基本建设部门的干部学习。
    年年基本建设的进度，都有一些时候不大令人满意。今年也不例外。全国1月至7月，只完成全年基本建设投资额的41.3％。8月份如何，现在还不清楚。如今，到年底只剩下四个月的时间了。全年的基本建设计划能不能完成，第一个五年计划的基本建设任务完成得好坏，全看这最后四个月了。然而，对于这“最后四个月”的感受，在有些基本建设干部中，都是同一般人大不相同的。
    有些同志是抱着消极情绪看这最后四个月的。他们觉得一年的光阴已去大半，五年计划只剩下四个月了，再加上原材料供应和设备供应还有困难，整风运动和社会主义教育又要时间，工作中的问题很多，似乎基本建设计划完不成已成定局，大势已去，再作努力也是白费劲。这种消极情绪显然是有害的。然而，也有些同志恰恰相反，他们是抱着盲目乐观情绪来看这最后四个月的。他们觉得今年任务本来不大，时间还有四个月，慢慢作来，也还不妨。乐观，本来是好的，但是盲目乐观，看不见工作上的问题，没有切切实实地做工作，对于完成计划，也是有害的。    四个月的时间，不算很长，也不算很短，对于想有一番作为的人说来，还是可以有所为的。希望基本建设部门的干部既批判消极情绪，又批判盲目乐观情绪，在这最后四个月里，以运动员在比赛场中作最后冲刺的精神，加一把油，把进度赶上去。只要真有这样一个冲刺，基本建设的进度必能加速。太原市的建筑企业就是一个例子。这个城市的建筑企业上半年平均只完成全年计划的25.7％，6月下旬，中共太原市委采取了紧急措施，各个建筑企业批判了消极情绪，加强了各方面的工作，来了一个冲刺。结果，7月份全市二十七个建筑企业超额16.7％完成了计划。
    当然，在这最后的冲刺中也要注意质量，节约和安全。
