Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 5th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Ruogang reported: The Harbin Ship Repair Factory, located on a rectangular island in the middle of the Songhua River, is currently surrounded by floods. The water level in the river is several meters higher than the factory floor. People are making every effort to fight to protect this factory in the river.

    The west side of the factory has the railway subgrade from Harbin to Manzhouli as a natural levee; the other three sides are surrounded by dikes. In order to withstand this year's extraordinary flood, all the dikes have been generally raised by one meter in the past week of flood control combat. Although the flood rises every day, the dikes are always raised as the water rises. On the outside of the dangerous dikes, iron plates originally used for shipbuilding have been laid to prevent wind and waves. There is not enough yellow earth and gravel here, and most of the river embankments are built with river mud and sand. Therefore, there are occasional water seepage points inside the dikes. In the last few days of August, the dike experienced continuous slope failures, but they were all rescued in time. One part of the dam body was once split in two, and people rescued it selflessly. More than 200 employees of the Heilongjiang Shipping Administration, who came to support, were reluctant to leave when it was time to change shifts. They worked from 3:00 PM until midnight. Dredgers also operated at full capacity, excavating dozens of cubic meters of soil from the riverbed every hour, ensuring the supply of soil for the rescue. After the rescue, the width of the dam body in this cracked area has been doubled compared to the original.

    In addition to manufacturing tugboats and barges, the Harbin Ship Repair Factory has a busy ship repair period from December to March of the following year. Many ships sailing in the Songhua River, Heilongjiang River, Ussuri River, and Nenjiang River come here for repairs.

    保卫江中一工厂
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　新华社记者孙若刚报道：位于松花江中一长方形小岛上的哈尔滨船舶修造厂，目前正处在洪水包围之中。江中水面已高出工厂平地几公尺。人们正在尽一切努力为保卫这座江中工厂而斗争。
    这座工厂的西面，有哈尔滨通往满洲里的铁路路基为自然堤坝；其余三面由堤坎环绕着。为了挡住今年的特大洪水，在过去一周的防汛战斗中，全部堤坝已普遍加高一公尺。虽然洪水天天上涨，但总是水涨堤高。在险要的堤坎外部，已经铺上原来造船用的铁板，以防风浪。这里没有足够的黄土和碎石，大部江堤都是用江中泥沙修筑的。因此，堤内时有渗水之处。8月底的几天中，堤坝曾连续发生脱坡现象，但是都被及时抢救过来了。有一处坝身曾经裂为两半，人们忘我地进行了抢救。前来支援的黑龙江航运管理局的二百多名职工，到了换班时刻仍不肯下去。他们从下午三时一直干到半夜。挖泥船也开足马力，每小时从江底挖出几十立方公尺的泥土，保证了抢险用土的供应。经过抢险，这裂开地方的坝身的宽度已经比原来增加了一倍。
    哈尔滨船舶修造厂除了制造拖轮和驳船外，每年从12月到翌年3月是繁忙的修船期。在松花江、黑龙江、乌苏里江和嫩江中航行的许多船只，都要到这里来检修。
