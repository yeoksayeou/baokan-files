　　The Moving "Coconut Grove Song"
　　Qin Zhen
    It has been half a year since I saw the film "Coconut Grove Song". Although a long time has passed, many moving scenes in the film are still vivid in my mind and unforgettable.
    The heroic sons and daughters of the Hainan Island people—the Qiongya Column—during the Anti-Japanese War, due to the enemy's blockade and sabotage, lost contact with the Party Central Committee for a considerable period. For the revolutionary struggle, what could be more worrying than losing contact with the Party Central Committee! Therefore, how to find a way to get in touch with the Party Central Committee and persist in the struggle became an urgent task for the Qiongya Column at that time, and it became the most important ideological basis that ran through the film "Coconut Grove Song". Therefore, how to transport a set of telecommunications equipment prepared by the Party Central Committee from the Leizhou Peninsula back to Hainan Island through the Qiongzhou Strait, which was tightly blockaded by the enemy, became the sharp conflict and plot of this film that firmly grasped people's hearts.
    In order to retrieve the telecommunications equipment, the newly married young woman, Xiu Mei, saw her husband, Zhang Ling, off and watched the small boat driven by Zhang Ling being hit by the enemy's blockading fire and turned into ashes... So Xiu Mei fell into great pain, sitting alone on the coast, staring into the distance. At this time, the film showed such a picture: waves crashing against rocks, churning and noisy. This scene fully expresses Xiu Mei's emotional ups and downs and unspeakable pain. And the audience naturally resonated with Xiu Mei's emotions. The audience was unconsciously brought into the lives of the protagonists of the film, caring about their fate as they cared about their own relatives.
    Then, Xiu Mei's mother came to the shore to find Xiu Mei. This strong and kind mother sat beside Xiu Mei, hugged her only daughter, and stared at the surging waves, while telling Xiu Mei the same story: more than ten years ago, also for the same purpose, in order to get in touch with the Party Central Committee, the mother also saw Xiu Mei's father off here. This tenacious fighter also left and never returned... Although the mother had cried all night for more than ten years, she had walked through it strongly, walking from the road of struggle! Here, the author used the method of flashback to tell us about the similar experiences of the mother and daughter at the same time, and arranged it on this unforgettable coast, arranged at such an urgent time. Therefore, thousands of worries gathered together, making our hearts unable to calm down like the waves.
　　Next, the film depicts the separation of Xiu Mei's mother and daughter. Because the unfinished task still needs Xiu Mei to undertake. When she was about to leave, Xiu Mei still wanted to comfort her lonely mother one last time, she said, "Mom, I know I'm the only one left by your side. If I leave, you will miss me." However, this mother who had experienced great pain resolutely replied, "No, as long as Mom can afford it, Mom is willing to let you go!" At this point, the mother's selfless and great spiritual power shone even more brilliantly.
    In addition to Xiu Mei and her mother giving people such a deep impression, I also cannot forget the white-haired old grandfather in the film, an old helmsman from a fishing family. He is not a Communist Party member. Before he knew the Party's difficulties, he did not want to smuggle across the strait to "do business", but when he found out, he was willing to risk his life to actively help the Party complete the urgent task. The film's director and actors successfully shaped the image of this old grandfather. He is so simple and strong that we can naturally appreciate the inherent qualities of the Chinese working people from him. He said very little, but did a lot; on the surface, we saw him as so slow and calm, but in his heart, he was full of enthusiasm and love for the revolutionary cause. Deep in this image, we can see the huge power of the Chinese people. The old grandfather used his rich experience and wisdom to help Xiu Mei cross the Qiongzhou Strait. And when they obtained the telecommunications equipment, were safely returning, and were about to arrive at Hainan Island, they encountered a Japanese patrol boat. In the fierce battle, the old grandfather died! He died lying on the telecommunications equipment. He shed his blood to protect the telecommunications equipment! Therefore, finally, when people set up the telegraph machine and read the first telegram sent by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the great image of this kind old grandfather stood before our eyes again.
    "Coconut Grove Song" moved us, educated us, and reminded us of the most difficult years of struggle and those comrades who sacrificed heroically for the cause of the Party with the vivid and great images of the mother and the old grandfather. It powerfully encourages and spurs us: to dedicate everything we have to the most beautiful revolutionary cause!

### 动人心弦的“椰林曲”

　　动人心弦的“椰林曲”
　　秦榛
    我看影片“椰林曲”，还是在半年之前的事了。虽然历时已久，但是影片中的不少动人的情节，仍然历历在目，经久难忘。
    英雄的海南岛人民的子弟兵——琼崖纵队，在抗日战争时期，由于敌人的封锁和破坏，曾经在相当长一个时期中和党中央失掉了联系。对于革命斗争来说，有什么比和党中央失掉了联系更使人焦急的呢！ 因此，如何设法与党中央取得联系，坚持斗争，就成了当时琼崖纵队的一个迫不及待的任务，并且成了始终贯穿在影片“椰林曲”中的最主要的思想基础。因此，如何通过敌人严密封锁的琼州海峡，把党中央准备好的一套电讯器材从雷州半岛运回海南岛来，也就成了这部影片的紧紧抓住人心的尖锐的冲突和情节。
    为了取回电讯器材，刚结婚不久的年轻妇女秀梅送走了丈夫张陵并且亲眼看见张陵所驾驶的小船，被敌人封锁的炮火击中，化为灰烬……于是秀梅陷于极大的痛苦之中，独自坐在海岸上，凝视着远方。这时，影片出现了这样一个画面：海浪冲击着岩石，翻腾着，喧闹着。这样的情景，充分表现出秀梅的情感的起伏和难言的痛苦。而观众也自然而然地和秀梅的情感起了共鸣。观众不自觉地被带入影片的主人公们的生活之中，像关怀自己的亲人一样关怀着他们的命运。
    接着，秀梅的母亲到岸边来找秀梅。这位坚强而慈祥的母亲，坐在秀梅身边，搂着她唯一的女儿，也凝视着汹涌的海浪，同时给秀梅叙述了一个相同的故事：十多年前，也是为了同样的目的，为了取得与党中央的联系，母亲也是在这里送走了秀梅的父亲。这位顽强的战士，也是一去就没有音讯……十几年来，母亲虽然也曾整夜地哭过，但是母亲却坚强地走过来了，从斗争的道路上走过来了！作者在这里运用了倒叙的方法把母亲和女儿的相同的遭遇，集中在一个时候告诉我们，而且安排在这使人永远难忘的海岸边，安排在这样紧急的时候。于是，千焦百虑拥集在一起，使我们的心也像海浪一样不能平静了。
　　接着，影片又描写了秀梅母女们的分离。因为那未完成的任务，还需要秀梅去担负。在临动身的时候，秀梅还想最后安慰安慰孤独的母亲，她说：“妈，我知道你身边只剩下我一个人了。我要是走了，你是会舍不得的。”可是，这位饱经痛苦的母亲却坚决地回答：“不，只要妈拿得出，妈是舍得的！”到这里，母亲的无私的伟大的精神力量，便发出更灿烂的光彩。
    除了秀梅母女俩给人如此深刻的印象外，我也忘不了影片中那一个白发苍苍的老爷爷，一个渔家的老舵手。他并不是一个共产党员。在他还没有知道党的困难之前，他并不想偷渡海峡去“做生意”，但是，当他知道了以后，他便甘愿冒着生命的危险，主动地帮助党去完成急切的任务。影片的编导和演员相当成功地塑造了这个老爷爷的形象，他是那么淳朴和刚强，我们能很自然地从他身上体会到那种中国劳动人民所固有的素质。他说得很少，但做得很多；表面上我们看到他是那么缓慢和沉静，但在他的内心里却充满了热情和对革命事业的热爱。在这一形象的深处，我们能看到那蕴藏着的中国人民的巨大力量。老爷爷以他的丰富的经验和智慧，把秀梅渡过了琼州海峡。而在他们获到了电讯器材，安全返航，快要到达海南岛的时候，却遇上了日寇的巡逻艇。在激烈的战斗中，老爷爷牺牲了！他是伏在电讯器材上死去的。他为了保护电讯器材而流尽了自己的鲜血！因此，最后，在人们把电报机架起来，并且宣读党中央和毛主席拍来的第一封电报的时候，在我们的眼前，便又重新站立起这位善良的老爷爷的巨大形象。
    “椰林曲”就是以母亲和老爷爷这样的鲜明而伟大的形象感动了我们，教育了我们，使我们回忆起那最艰苦的斗争年代，回忆起那些为了党的事业而壮烈牺牲了的同志。它有力地鼓励和鞭策了我们：把自己的一切，献给最美好的革命事业！
