    Socialist economic cooperation is a powerful driving force for the accelerated development of productive forces in socialist countries. This economic cooperation is based on complete equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance. Only among socialist countries can such selfless cooperation be realized, cooperation aimed at peace and ensuring the permanent prosperity of economic, scientific, cultural, and other social aspects of life.

    In the cause of developing and consolidating economic cooperation among socialist countries, the Soviet Union has played a significant role. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to break through the imperialist front, the first to build socialism, and is now moving towards a happy communism. Thanks to the Soviet Union's selfless assistance, the People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia embarked on the socialist path only twelve years ago. The comprehensive assistance generously provided by the Soviet Union has helped Czechoslovakia overcome various difficulties and rapidly develop its industry and other economic sectors.

    In the past decade of construction, Czechoslovakia's industrial production has increased more than two and a half times, with an average annual growth of 15%. The People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia regards the consolidation and strengthening of economic ties with socialist countries as one of its primary tasks. In the past few years, the economic cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China has grown considerably. The Trade and Payments Agreement signed in 1950 is the foundation of this cooperation. From 1950 to 1956, the volume of trade between our two countries increased more than fourfold. All this proves the increasing labor enthusiasm of workers, technicians, and all working people in Czechoslovakia and China in recent years, who are building the foundations of a new social system with their own hands and wisdom. With the continuous development of the national economies of Czechoslovakia and China, the economic cooperation between the two countries will be further expanded.

    The increasingly consolidated economic ties between the two sides are made possible by the continuous development of socialist industry. Czechoslovakia is a highly developed industrial country. This country has a highly developed heavy industry, mainly machine manufacturing. From 1948 to 1955, the production of our machine manufacturing industry increased by 268%.

    The diverse range of products from Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing industry enables Czechoslovakia not only to export a large number of machine parts but also complete sets of equipment for industrial enterprises, such as equipment for power stations, machine manufacturing, chemical, food, and other factories. In recent years, highly efficient metal-processing machine tools, presses, semi-automatic and automatic lathes, and various types of machinery have greatly increased in our country. These machines accelerate the production process and improve labor productivity.

    Modern production methods in machine manufacturing and the planned division of labor in production among machine manufacturing factories in socialist countries enable Czechoslovakia to export more general-purpose lathes as well. The mass production of these general-purpose lathes can further accelerate the production process and reduce costs.

    Automobiles and aircraft are major components of machine manufacturing production. The fact that our heavy-duty trucks can travel smoothly on uneven roads like the Tibetan Plateau once again proves the quality of the work of our workers and technicians. In the past few years, according to trade agreements, Czechoslovak factories have provided many machines to Chinese workers. These machines have helped the Chinese people carry out the tasks of socialist industrialization and agricultural mechanization.

    The commodity exchange between our two countries has also greatly helped the development of Czechoslovakia's national economy. Although Czechoslovakia is a country with abundant resources, it still lacks certain raw materials, such as high-quality iron ore, non-ferrous metal ore, and other useful minerals. Scientific and technological cooperation occupies an important position in the economic ties between our two countries. The basis of this cooperation fully complies with the agreement signed in 1952. Czechoslovakia had a fully developed industry when it embarked on the socialist path. Thanks to the wise policy of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in directing the plan for the development of Czechoslovakia's national economy, the metallurgy, machine manufacturing, and chemical sectors have expanded first. In the past, these sectors were completely dependent on imports from capitalist countries. Production has reached an advanced world level in many sectors. Therefore, we believe that the primary task in scientific and technological cooperation is to provide more effective assistance to all people's democratic countries, especially the People's Republic of China, which has put forward great tasks in its Second Five-Year Plan and is advancing victoriously along the path of socialist industrialization. The acceleration of the technological development process and the achievements in the economic and cultural development of socialist countries prove the great significance of scientific and technological cooperation. The Czechoslovak people are willing to provide the Chinese people, who are formulating new factory designs, with machinery and equipment, scientific and technological documents, and technical documents for mastering new production processes. Czechoslovak technicians and workers in China are happy to help China build many new factories. These new factories are the foundation of the country's invincible strength and the foundation of the people's cultural life and welfare.

    The greatest goal in the economic construction of our two countries requires us to make better use of the conditions for scientific and technological cooperation that we already have. This beneficial exchange of scientific and technological and cultural wealth is the eternal foundation of our precious friendship. The foundation of this valuable relationship is the common ideology, the vibrant doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

    The Czechoslovak people are extremely concerned about and value the achievements made by the Chinese people, who are engaged in active and selfless labor under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China has not only achieved brilliant achievements in economic construction but also in cultural aspects. Workers all over the world are jubilantly welcoming these brilliant achievements made by China. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to establish a large-scale industrial system during the three five-year plans. Facts have proved that this proposal is entirely possible to realize in China. The Chinese people have overthrown the rule of imperialism, reactionary feudal lords, and traitorous bureaucratic capitalists in China.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, China's industrial production should increase approximately threefold compared to the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, China's industrial construction will make greater progress.

    All the people of Czechoslovakia are watching with great sympathy and enthusiasm the great achievements made by the Chinese working people in their great construction and their unremitting efforts to consolidate world peace and international cooperation.

    All the people of Czechoslovakia sincerely wish the people of the People's Republic of China greater achievements in building a happy life in the future! May our two peoples further strengthen our brotherly alliance in the struggle for peace and friendship among the peoples of the world in the future! (Translated by Ling Hai)

    捷中经济合作
    捷克斯洛伐克副总理  卡·波拉契克
    社会主义的经济合作是社会主义国家加速发展本国生产力的巨大推动力。这种经济合作是建立在完全平等互利和互助的基础上的。只有在社会主义国家之间，才能实现这种无私的合作，这种合作的目的是为了和平，保证经济、科学、文化和其他社会生活的永久繁荣。
    在发展和巩固社会主义各国之间的经济合作的事业中，苏联起了重大的作用。苏联是世界上第一个冲破帝国主义阵线的国家，是第一个建成社会主义和正走向幸福的共产主义的国家。人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克由于苏联无代价的帮助，在十二年前才走上社会主义道路。苏联非常慷慨地给予的全面援助，帮助了捷克斯洛伐克克服各种困难，加速地发展了工业和其他经济部门。
    在过去十年建设中，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产增加了二倍半以上，平均每年增长15％。人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克把巩固和加强同社会主义各国的经济联系作为自己首要任务之一。在过去的几年里，捷中两国的经济合作在相当大的范围内增长了。1950年签订的贸易和支付协定是这个合作的基础。从1950年到1956年，我们两国的商品交换额增加了四倍多。这一切证明近年来捷中两国工人、技术人员和全体劳动人民的劳动热情不断高涨，他们正用自己的双手和智慧建设着新社会制度的基础。随着捷中两国国民经济不断的发展，两国的经济合作也将更进一步的扩大。
    双方日益巩固着的经济联系之所以成为可能，是由于社会主义工业的不断发展。捷克斯洛伐克是一个工业高度发展的国家。这个国家有高度发展的重工业，主要是机器制造业。从1948年到1955年，我国机器制造的生产量增加了268％。
    捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业多样品种的产品，使捷克斯洛伐克不仅能输出大量机器部件，并能输出工业企业的成套设备。如：发电站、机器制造、化学、食品和其他工厂的设备。近年来，高效能的金属加工车床、压榨机、半自动化和自动化的车床以及各种类型的机械在我国都大大地增加了。这些机器加速着生产的过程，提高了劳动生产率。
    机器制造方面现代化的生产方法和社会主义各国机器制造工厂之间生产的有计划分工，使得捷克斯洛伐克也能够更多地输出普通车床。这种普通车床成批大量的生产，能够进一步加速生产过程和降低成本。
    汽车和飞机是机器制造业生产的主要组成部分。我们的载重汽车能够顺利地在西藏高原那样不平坦的道路上行驶，这又一次证明了我们的工人和技术人员工作的质量。前几年按照贸易协定，捷克斯洛伐克工厂为中国的工人提供了许多机器。这些机器帮助中国人民执行社会主义工业化和农业机械化的任务。
    我们两国之间的商品交换也大大地帮助了捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的发展。捷克斯洛伐克虽然是一个拥有丰富资源的国家，但她仍然缺乏某些原料，例如：高级质量的铁矿、有色金属矿和其他有用矿物。科学技术的合作在我们两国经济联系中占重要的地位。这种合作的基础完全符合于1952年所签订的协定。捷克斯洛伐克走上社会主义道路时，就有了充分发展的工业。由于捷克斯洛伐克共产党在领导捷克斯洛伐克发展国民经济计划方向的英明政策，首先是冶金、机器制造业和化学部门扩大了。过去这些部门完全仰赖于从资本主义国家输入。在很多部门里生产已经达到世界先进水平了。因此我们认为目前在科学技术合作方面的首要任务是给各人民民主国家，首先是给中华人民共和国以更有效的帮助，中国在第二个五年计划中提出了巨大的任务，它正胜利地沿着社会主义工业化的道路前进。技术发展过程的加速和社会主义各国经济文化发展的成就，证明了科学技术合作的重大意义。捷克斯洛伐克人民愿意以机器设备、科学技术文件和掌握新生产过程的技术文件供给正在制定新工厂设计图案的中国人民。在中国的捷克斯洛伐克的技术人员和工人们愉快地帮助中国建设了许多新工厂。这些新工厂是国家不可战胜的力量的基础，是人民文化生活福利的基础。
    我们两国经济建设事业中的最大目的，要求我们更好地利用已具有的科学技术合作的条件。这种科学技术和文化财富的有益的交换是我们宝贵友谊的永恒的基础。这种可贵的关系的基础，是共同的思想，富有生命力的马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义精神。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民极其关心和重视积极忘我地从事劳动的中国人民在中国共产党领导下所取得的成就。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，中国不仅在经济建设方面取得了辉煌的成就，并在文化方面也取得了光辉的成就。全世界的工人都欢欣鼓舞地欢迎中国所取得的这些辉煌的成就。中国共产党第八次代表大会曾提出，在三个五年计划期间要建立一个大规模的工业体系。事实已证明这个提议在中国完全可能实现。中国人民已推翻了帝国主义、反动的封建主和卖国的官僚资本家在中国的统治。
    中国在第二个五年计划期间，工业生产应比第一个五年计划开始时增加约三倍。在第二个五年计划期间，中国的工业建设将有更大的进展。
    捷克斯洛伐克全体人民怀着巨大的同情和热情关怀着中国劳动人民在伟大建设中所取得的巨大成就，和他们为巩固世界和平与国际合作的事业所作的不懈努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克全体人民衷心地预祝中华人民共和国人民在建设未来幸福的生活中获得更大的成就！愿我们两国人民在今后争取和平和世界各国人民的友谊的斗争中，进一步加强兄弟的联盟！　（凌海译）
