　　Dog-Raising Craze and Dog Tax
　　Human Hell, Dog Heaven
　　In America, the rich have made a craze of raising dogs, spending $120 million on feed alone last year. The total number of dogs raised in the United States, according to statistics from last December, is over 19,796,000.
　　Some Americans have launched a "Dog Week." There is also an annual festival held specifically for dogs. In the United States, there are also manuals published on raising dogs, now in their sixth edition, with 5,000 copies per edition. Recently, a dog's "Nobel Prize" was established, totaling $2,000, awarded to the person who has made the "greatest contribution to the health and welfare of dogs" in a year.
　　In America, millions of working people are suffering, while the dogs favored by the rich are enjoying themselves.
　　Danish Dogs Also Have Taxes
　　In Denmark, dogs also have to pay taxes, and what's even stranger is that the amount of tax depends on the height of the dog. Therefore, in Denmark, dogs are all long and short. The picture is a caricature drawn by Danish cartoonist Herluf Bidstrup.

　　养狗风与狗头税
　　人的地狱  狗的天堂
    美国有钱的人养狗成风，去年一年单是饲料就花费一亿二千万美元。全美国所养狗的总数，据去年12月的统计在一千九百七十九万六千头以上。
    美国有人发起“狗周”。一年一度还有人专为狗举办节日。在美国还有养狗的手册出版，现在已出到第六版，每版五千册。最近还设置了狗的“诺贝尔奖金”，计二千美元，奖给一年中“对狗的健康和福利最有贡献”的人。
    在美国，千百万劳动的人在受苦，而富人宠爱的狗却在享福。
    丹麦狗也有税
    在丹麦，狗也要纳税，更奇怪的是税的多少，取决于狗的高矮。所以，在丹麦，狗都是长长的，矮矮的。图为丹麦漫画家赫尔鲁福·比兹特鲁普所画的一幅讽刺画。
