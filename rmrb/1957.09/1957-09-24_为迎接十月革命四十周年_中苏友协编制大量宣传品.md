    In Preparation for the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Compiles a Large Number of Propaganda Materials
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters is intensifying its preparations for celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution. From mid-October to the end of the month, readers will be able to see three books written and translated by the Propaganda Department of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters. One is a special edition of "Red Flag Fluttering" Series 4, which records the deeds of Chinese people participating in the October Revolution and fighting alongside the Soviet Red Army. Another is the Chinese translation of the recently published Soviet book "The Soviet Union." This book is divided into six chapters, introducing the geography, politics, economy, culture, and people's lives of the Soviet Union, including some of the latest materials. The authors are the famous Soviet writer and geographer Mikhailov and Doctor of Law Denisov, among others. There is also a book entitled "Learn from the Soviet People's Spirit of Hard Work and Thrift in Nation-Building," which comprehensively introduces the arduous struggles of the Soviet people in the early days of nation-building.
    In April of this year, Chairman Voroshilov visited our country. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters compiled a complete album of photographs taken during Voroshilov's visits to various places, which will be published in early November. In addition to this album, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, together with the China Association for Science and Technology, jointly compiled six albums: "The Great Soviet Union: Forty Years," "Soviet Industrial Construction," "Soviet Agriculture," "Soviet Science," "Soviet Cultural and Educational Undertakings," and "The Great Sino-Soviet Friendship."
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters also invited famous Chinese painters Jiang Zhaohe, Zhang Guangyu, Zhou Lingzhao, and others to create five propaganda paintings. The themes of these paintings are: "Long Live the Great October Socialist Revolution!" "Advance Victoriously Along the Path of the October Revolution!" "Building Communism is Our Common Goal," "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Unity!" and "The Ultimate Victory of Socialism is Completely and Absolutely Guaranteed."
    Before the October Revolution Day, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters will provide hundreds of sets of photos about the forty years of the Soviet revolution for exhibitions and street window displays across the country. In addition, a series of rich and informative propaganda reference materials have been compiled and distributed to various places for the reference of reporters and propagandists. These materials include: quotations from Chinese and Soviet leaders and responsible comrades on the significance of the October Revolution and Sino-Soviet relations, introductions to the achievements of Soviet construction, the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to China, and a chronology of major Sino-Soviet friendship events since the founding of the People's Republic of China, etc. (Image attached)
