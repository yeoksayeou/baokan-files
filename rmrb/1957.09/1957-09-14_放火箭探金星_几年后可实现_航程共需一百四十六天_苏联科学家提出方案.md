Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th: Between 1962 and 1967, it may be possible for people to launch the first rocket to Venus, the planet closest to Earth, for exploration. This was stated by the famous Soviet expert in interstellar transportation, Khlebtsevich, in his Venus exploration plan recently published in the Soviet magazine "Knowledge is Power," following his proposals for exploring the Moon and Mars.

According to the author's preliminary design, this rocket would be unmanned. It would be a three-stage rocket launched from an airplane. The final stage would propel it along a special trajectory into an orbit 35,810 kilometers above the Earth, where it would automatically revolve around the Earth. Then, rockets controlled from the ground would add more fuel to the rocket. After refueling, the rocket would fly to Venus according to radio commands sent from Earth.

The flight would take a total of 146 days. Ground-based and rocket-borne radio devices could measure the rocket's position between Earth and Venus. Necessary radio commands for correcting the flight path could be sent from Earth at any time.

The day before the rocket lands on Venus, when the rocket is 300,000 kilometers from Venus, a powerful electronic telescope installed on the rocket, controlled from Earth, would begin taking photographs and transmitting them back to Earth. At least 8,000 photographs could be taken within these twenty-four hours. The final photograph, taken at an altitude of several tens of kilometers above the surface of Venus and magnified 1,000 times, would appear as if it were taken at a height of less than 100 meters. In this way, it could be determined whether life exists on Venus. The author points out that a total of only five rockets, each weighing 250 tons, would be sufficient to complete this task.

The author points out that, due to the rapid development of "cosmic television," it will be possible in the future to record television images on magnetic tape using countless powerful antennas, and then use electronic computers to remove atmospheric interference, thereby obtaining clear television images sent from Venus, which is 100 million kilometers away.

The author also said that after creating completely new types of engines powered by atomic energy or new forms of energy that are still unknown, it will be possible to further realize the ideal of sending manned spacecraft to Venus.

### 放火箭探金星  几年后可实现  航程共需一百四十六天  苏联科学家提出方案

　　放火箭探金星  几年后可实现
    航程共需一百四十六天
    苏联科学家提出方案
    新华社莫斯科13日电  在1962年到1967年间人们就有可能放出第一支火箭到离地球最近的行星——金星上去考察，这是苏联著名星际交通专家赫列勃采维奇继他提出考察月球、火星方案之后，最近在苏联“知识就是力量”杂志上发表的考察金星方案中说的。
    根据作者的初步设想，这支火箭是无人乘坐的。它是一种三段火箭，将从飞机上发射出去，最后一段将使它沿着一个特别的弹道射到离地面三万五千八百一十公里的轨道上，自动环绕地球旋转。然后一些受地面控制的火箭将给这支火箭加上更多的燃料。这支火箭在添足燃料后，就按照地球上发来的无线电命令飞往金星。
    飞行一共需要一百四十六天。地面和火箭上的无线电装置可以测出火箭在地球和金星间的位置。从地球上可以随时发出必要的修正飞行路线的无线电命令。
    在这支火箭降落在金星上的前一天，就是当火箭离金星三十万公里的时候，从地球上控制的装在火箭上的强大的电子天文望远装置开始拍摄照片，并把照片发到地球上来。在这二十四小时内，至少可以拍摄八千张照片。最后一张照片是在距金星表面几十公里的高空中拍摄的，在放大一千倍后看起来好像是在高度不到一百公尺的地方照的。这样，就可以确定在金星上是否有生物存在。作者指出，总共只要用二百五十吨重的五支火箭就足以完成这项工作。
    作者指出，由于“宇宙电视”正在飞跃发展，今后利用无数强力的天线，就可以在磁带口记录下电视影象，然后利用电子计算机去掉它们的天电，从而获得从相隔一亿公里的金星上发来的清晰的电视影象。
    作者还说，在创造了由原子能或至今还不知道的新的能源所发动的完全新式的发动机以后，还有可能进一步实现使载人的宇宙飞船飞往金星上去的理想。
