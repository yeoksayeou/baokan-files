    Blacklists and the Black Market for Scripts

    In 1947, the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee, under the pretext of "investigating the communist situation in Hollywood," carried out a frenzied persecution of some just-minded film workers in Hollywood. Since then, over the course of ten years, the number of people victimized and placed on blacklists has increased from ten to two hundred and fifty.

    Hollywood's blacklist is only a small part of the entire American blacklist. Playwrights, directors, critics, producers, actors... who were placed on the blacklist were deprived of their right to work in the country, but were not allowed to leave the country. The blacklist caused directors with slightly progressive tendencies to lose their studios, musicians could not perform, actors could not appear on stage, and many artists suffered mental breakdowns and the destruction of their families.

    It is difficult for directors and actors to change careers due to the nature of their work, but creators can still maintain their livelihoods by submitting articles under pseudonyms or anonymously. This created a black market for film scripts in Hollywood.

    The script for the American film "Friendly Persuasion" once caused a dispute that became a major scandal. It turned out that the film's script was adapted from a novel by the female writer West. The screenwriter was Michael Wilson. However, Wilson was blacklisted. Therefore, when "Friendly Persuasion" was released, his name was completely omitted, as if the film script was also written by West.

    "Friendly Persuasion" was recommended for a prize from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In order to prevent people on the blacklist from receiving awards, the Academy specially amended its regulations, stipulating that anyone who refused to answer questions from the House Un-American Activities Committee would not be eligible for an award.

    Another persecuted screenwriter, using the pseudonym Robert Rich, wrote a film script called "The Brave One." This script won an award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The persecuted screenwriter did not come forward to claim the prize. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences asked the publisher if Robert Rich actually existed. The publisher said that Robert Rich did indeed exist, that he was a young man with a beard, and that the film script was sold in 1952. No sooner had the publisher's statement been circulated than five Robert Riches appeared in the "New York Post" in less than two days. A nephew of Robert Rich even appeared in San Francisco, ready to collect the prize on his behalf.

    Finally, Dalton Trumbo, a screenwriter who had been persecuted since 1947 and continued to write anonymously, used television to expose the inside story of blacklists and the black market for scripts. Trumbo said that since the blacklist began, he, like other persecuted screenwriters, had been engaged in black market transactions. Major American studios bought these scripts on the black market and filmed them, but without using the real names of the authors. Trumbo said that his own anonymous works had been nominated for awards. However, Trumbo refused to say whether he had ever received an award or whether he was the author of "The Brave One." Therefore, the identity of the author of "The Brave One" remains a mystery. Leshan

    黑名单与剧本黑市
    1947年，臭名远扬的美国众议院“非美活动调查委员会”，以“调查好莱坞共产主义情形”为借口，对好莱坞的一些具有正义感的电影工作者进行疯狂迫害。从那个时候以来，十年间，列名于黑名单而受害的人，由十名增加到了二百五十名。
    好莱坞的黑名单不过是美国整个黑名单里的一小部分。被列入黑名单的剧作家、导演、评论家、制片人、演员……被剥夺了在国内工作的权利，但是又不准离境出国。黑名单使稍有进步倾向的导演失去了影棚，音乐家不能演奏，演员不能登场，许多艺术工作者因此神经失常、家破人亡。
    导演与演员，由于工作的特性，改行是困难的，可是创作家还可以化名或匿名投稿维持生活。这样就产生了好莱坞的电影剧本的黑市。
    美国影片“亲切的劝告”的剧本曾经引起了一场纠纷，闹得满城风雨。原来这部电影的剧本是根据女作家韦斯特的小说改编的。剧作者是迈克尔·威尔逊。可是威尔逊是被列入黑名单的。因此当“亲切的劝告”上演的时候，就完全不提他的姓名，仿佛电影剧本也是由韦斯特写的。
    “亲切的劝告”这部电影被推荐领取“国家电影艺术学院”的奖金。这个学院为了阻止黑名单上列名的人领奖，特地修改了它的规章，规定凡是拒绝答复“非美活动调查委员会”询问的人，就不能获奖。
    另有一个被迫害的剧作家化名劳伯·里希编写了一个电影剧本“勇敢的人”。这个剧本获得了“国家电影艺术学院”的奖金。被迫害的剧作家没有出来具领奖金。“国家电影艺术学院”询问出版商究竟有无劳伯·里希其人。出版商说，劳伯·里希确有其人，他是一个蓄有胡子的、年纪不大的人，电影脚本是在1952年成交的。出版商的说法一经传出，不到两天，“纽约邮报”上竟出现了五个劳伯·里希。旧金山还出现了一个劳伯·里希的侄子，准备代领奖金。
    最后，早在1947年受迫害后、一直匿名继续写作的剧作家道尔登·杜伦波利用电视揭发了黑名单与剧本黑市的内幕。杜伦波说，自从黑名单开始以来，他就与其他受迫害的剧作家一样从事了黑市交易，美国的大制片厂在黑市上购买这些剧本、拍摄影片，但不用剧作者的真实姓名。杜伦波说他自己的匿名作品曾被推荐领奖。不过杜伦波不肯说出他到底领过奖没有，也不肯说“勇敢的人”究竟是不是他作的。因此，谁是“勇敢的人”的作者，还是一个谜。　乐山
