Fabricating the Absurd Lie of the Extinguishment of Class Struggle
Zhang Zhifa Demands the Disarmament of Public Security Organs

    Xi'an, September 16th (from our newspaper) - All cadres of the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department have held eight consecutive meetings to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Zhang Zhifa, a rightist element in the department.

    Zhang Zhifa attempted to change the nature of public security organs as one of the tools of the people's democratic dictatorship. He believed that in today's situation where "the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy have been resolved, and class contradictions no longer exist," "the function of public security organs should be transformed into a social service department." He also arrogantly clamored that "public security work in the future does not need to be so 'mysterious' or 'special'," that "public security work plans can be published in newspapers," and that "representatives of the bourgeoisie should be allowed to participate in public security work" in order to achieve his goal of abolishing the Party's leadership and undermining the people's democratic dictatorship.

    All cadres of the Public Security Department refuted Zhang Zhifa's reactionary fallacies, which denied the existence of class struggle and attempted to change the function of public security organs, based on facts and reason. Nan Yifeng and six others, in their speeches, cited facts to question Zhang Zhifa: At the time of the counter-revolutionary riot in Hu County, counter-revolutionary elements destroyed the township government, injured the township head, and clamored for the establishment of a "Benevolent Government"; Ji Fu'an, a capitalist in Tongchuan, plotted to settle accounts; Liu Jianwen, a landlord element in Xianyang, and others openly spread the reactionary fallacy that they wanted to "overturn the tables," etc. Aren't these class struggles? Zhang Zhifa's attempt to change the function of the public security department is essentially to restore capitalism.

    Under the relentless attacks of the masses, Zhang Zhifa had no choice but to begin to lower his head and confess his crimes.

　　制造阶级斗争熄灭的弥天大谎
　　张志发要公安机关解除武装
    本报西安16日电　陕西省公安厅全体干部连续举行八次会议，揭发和批判了该厅右派分子张志发的反动言行。
    张志发企图改变作为人民民主专政的工具之一的公安机关的性质。他认为在“敌我矛盾已经解决，阶级矛盾已不存在”的今天，“公安机关的职能应该转变为社会事业部门”。他还狂妄地叫嚣“公安工作今后不需要那末‘神秘’，‘特殊’”，“公安工作计划可以在报纸上公布”，并且“应当让资产阶级代表参加公安工作”，以便达到他取消党的领导、破坏人民民主专政的目的。
    公安厅全体干部据理驳斥了张志发否认阶级斗争存在、妄图改变公安机关职能的反动谬论。南一峰等七人在发言中列举事实责问张志发：在鄠县反革命暴乱的时候，反革命分子捣毁乡政府，打伤乡长，叫嚣要成立“人义政府”；铜川资本家姬福安阴谋倒算；咸阳地主分子刘建文等公开散布他们要“翻身”的反动谬论等等，难道这些不是阶级斗争吗？张志发妄图改变公安部门的职能，其实质是要使资本主义复辟。
    在群众的穷追猛攻下，张志发不得不开始低头认罪。
