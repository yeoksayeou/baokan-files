    Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping and Other Central Leaders Attend to Offer Congratulations
    Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The Third National Women's Congress of China opened this afternoon at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Auditorium in Beijing.
    Over 1,200 women representatives from all ethnic groups across the country attended today's congress. This congress is convened during a period of vigorous development in the motherland's socialist construction. The first congress was held in March 1949, and the second congress was held in April 1953. The representatives attending this congress have broader representation than those of the previous two congresses. The oldest representative at this congress is seventy-one years old, and the youngest is an eighteen-year-old young woman.
    Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping and other leaders of the CPC Central Committee attended the meeting to congratulate the women. As they stepped onto the rostrum, the entire audience stood up, and the representatives expressed their warm welcome with stormy applause.
    Also attending today's congress were members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Peng Zhen, Li Fuchun, He Long, alternate members Zhang Wentian, Lu Dingyi, Bo Yibo, Vice-Chairmen of the CPPCC Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, as well as representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations in China.
    The opening ceremony of the congress was held at 3:00 PM. After the band played the national anthem, the Chairman of the Congress, Cai Chang, delivered the opening address. When discussing the tasks of the congress, Cai Chang stated that this congress should become a mobilization conference for practicing thrift and diligence in building the nation and managing households, and it should become a battle conference against the Rightists.
    Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhu De, extended warm congratulations to the congress and to women across the country on behalf of the CPC Central Committee. The entire audience welcomed him with thunderous applause.
    A congratulatory message from Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Soong Ching Ling, was read at the congress. Soong Ching Ling called on women to resolutely pass the socialist test.
    The speech by He Xiangning, an 80-year-old revolutionary veteran and honorary chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, deeply moved the representatives.
    Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Guo Moruo, addressed the congress. Subsequently, Lai Ruoyu and Liao Chengzhi delivered congratulatory speeches on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Youth Federation, respectively. Lai Ruoyu said that in socialist industrial production and various construction endeavors, women are working diligently everywhere. Together with male workers, they have created outstanding achievements, demonstrating the working class's qualities of diligence, bravery, and creative talent. As a part of the working class, the vast number of employees' families have also made glorious contributions to the development of our country's industrial production and construction. They support the production and labor of workers actively by practicing thrift and diligence in managing households and achieving "five goods." Their contributions are included in the achievements of the workers.
    Lai Ruoyu said that with the development of our country's socialist construction, more women will continue to join the ranks of the working class. In the future, trade union organizations at all levels will continue to strengthen the work related to female employees, care for their special difficulties, help them raise their awareness, improve their working abilities and technical skills, and mobilize all female employees to actively participate in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, so as to guarantee the over-fulfillment of national production tasks.
    Liao Chengzhi particularly expressed his hopes for young women in his speech. He hoped that young women would earnestly learn and inherit the fine traditions of Chinese women. Liao Chengzhi praised Chinese women as great women, renowned for their simplicity, diligence, and kindness. He said that many outstanding women have emerged in Chinese history, and even more great women who dedicated themselves to the revolution and the cause of the people's liberation have emerged in the revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China in modern times. Now, young women living in the socialist era must inherit and carry forward the noble moral qualities of their predecessors in order to be worthy of being women of the new China.
    Liao Chengzhi warmly hoped that the older generations in the women's circles would cherish and care for the growth of young people. He said that mothers play a particularly important role in the cause of educating the next generation, and mothers' thoughts and behaviors have a profound impact on their children. We hope that mothers across the country can care more and better for the growth of their children. We hope that through the joint efforts of adult, elderly, and young women, every family will be built into a harmonious and happy family under the great premise of building socialism.
    Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Miss Pushpa Mehta Bose, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress, sincerely wishing the congress success.
    The speeches of the guests were welcomed by all the representatives and were interrupted by warm applause again and again.
    At the meeting, Zhang Yun, on behalf of the Second Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation, delivered a work report to the congress entitled "Building the Nation and Managing Households Through Thrift and Diligence, Striving for Socialist Construction."
    Foreign guests invited to attend this congress included Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation Miss Bose and women representatives from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, Germany, Albania, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia. Mrs. Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Asian Solidarity Committee, and two others, who are currently visiting Beijing, also accepted the invitation to attend this congress. Wives of foreign envoys to China were also invited to participate in the congress.
    During the recess of the congress, the leaders of the CPC Central Committee met with Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation Miss Bose and women representatives from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, as well as Mrs. Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Asian Solidarity Committee, and others.
