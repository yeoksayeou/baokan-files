    Major Reform in Farm Management

    In state-owned farms, the smaller the proportion of non-productive personnel among the total number of employees, the better. This is an easily understood principle. However, to what extent can this proportion be reduced? Opinions vary. Not long ago, the local state-owned Beijing Southern Suburb Farm, Western Suburb Farm, and Eastern Suburb Livestock Farm, after careful consideration and thorough investigation, were determined to greatly reduce the number of non-productive personnel. The Southern Suburb Farm reduced its non-productive personnel from 89 to 16, accounting for only 1.2% of the current total number of employees. The Western Suburb Farm reduced its non-productive personnel from 71 to 13, accounting for only 1.9% of the current total number of employees. The Eastern Suburb Livestock Farm reduced its non-productive personnel from 120 to 13, accounting for only 1.5% of the current total number of employees. This should be regarded as a major reform in the state-owned farm business. This matter is of great significance to state-owned farms and ranches throughout the country.

    Undoubtedly, there are many benefits to streamlining non-productive personnel to the minimum necessary number. The most obvious benefit is that it can greatly save expenses and reduce production costs. Everyone knows that state-owned farms and ranches in our country have made great achievements in reclaiming wasteland, increasing agricultural and livestock products, and training cadres in recent years. However, a fatal problem still exists in farms and ranches everywhere, that is, production costs are too high, labor productivity is low, and the task of delivering profits to the state cannot be completed. One of the important reasons for this situation is that the organization is huge, there are too many non-productive personnel, and management costs and wages account for too large a proportion of total expenditure. According to the National State-owned Farm and Ranch Work Conference in February this year, the proportion of administrative and management personnel in the total number of employees in state-owned farms and ranches across the country generally exceeds 10%, and some even exceed 20%. Since the spring of this year, farms and ranches in various places have begun to make some efforts to streamline their organizations, but the management organizations of most farms and ranches are still quite large, and there are still too many non-productive personnel. After the preliminary streamlining in the spring, the number of non-productive personnel in eight state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province decreased by 10% to 15% compared with the past, but still accounted for 11% of the total number of employees. In the farms and ranches in other regions, there are also many units where non-productive personnel still account for more than 5% of the total number of employees after streamlining. Can it be reduced further? The leadership of many farms and ranches cannot make this determination. Now, the facts are here. Everyone, look, since the Beijing Southern Suburb Farm can streamline the number of non-productive personnel from 7.3% of the total number of employees to 1.2%, the Western Suburb Farm can streamline the number of non-productive personnel from 11.7% of the total number of employees to 1.9%, and the Eastern Suburb Livestock Farm can streamline the number of non-productive personnel from 13.3% of the total number of employees to 1.5%, then why can't other farms and ranches do this?

    Will this weaken the leadership of farms and ranches and affect their production and management work? The facts of the Beijing Southern Suburb Farm, Western Suburb Farm, and Eastern Suburb Livestock Farm have answered: after doing this, not only has the leadership work not been weakened, but bureaucracy has been greatly overcome or reduced, and the connection between cadres and the masses has been greatly strengthened, making the leadership force more in-depth into the masses and into production. The view that "more people make things easier" has gone bankrupt in the face of this fact. Having more people does not necessarily mean that things can be done well. It is precisely because of the large management organizations, overlapping leadership levels, and overstaffing of many farms and ranches that bureaucracy and red tape have developed. In these enterprises, meetings are extremely frequent, and forms and documents are extremely complex, forming a heavy pressure, making it difficult for leaders to go deep into the lower levels and into the production process, and they cannot solve problems in production in a timely manner. Streamlining the management organization and reducing non-productive personnel will naturally squeeze out unnecessary meetings and reports, and leaders can also get rid of the invisible ropes in the office and go to production to effectively lead production. Before the organization was streamlined, the management organization of the Beijing Southern Suburb Farm, Western Suburb Farm, and Eastern Suburb Livestock Farm was large, and there were too many non-productive personnel. Many things were pushed back and forth and could not be handled in a timely manner. After streamlining the organization, the combination of mental and physical labor was better, and there were fewer people sitting in the office. Administrative and political work was done by the leading cadres of the Party committee, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. After the cadres went to the fields to work, many problems could be solved at any time, and work efficiency was improved compared to the past.

    Of course, when thoroughly streamlining organizational structures, reducing staff, and improving working methods, some ideological obstacles will inevitably be encountered. Some staff may have incorrect views on participating in productive labor, and they still despise physical labor. To solve this problem, ideological education must be carried out. This can be closely integrated with the rectification movement. This work is also an important part of the rectification movement. When ideological problems are resolved, people will happily walk out of the office, devote themselves to productive labor, and gain valuable experience from labor. Technicians at the Beijing Southern Suburb Farm used to spend a lot of time in the office every month writing technical measures plans, production summaries, etc. Now they can go deep into the fields, provide technical guidance while working, and are welcomed by the workers, and they themselves have also learned a lot of specific production knowledge and labor skills that are difficult to learn in books.

    The Beijing Southern Suburb Farm, Western Suburb Farm, and Eastern Suburb Livestock Farm have set a good example for farms and ranches across the country. All state-owned farms and ranches should learn from this example and, in accordance with the principles of building the country through diligence and thrift and running enterprises through diligence and thrift, quickly complete the work of streamlining organizations during the rectification movement. In order to do this work well, each farm should immediately conduct a comprehensive plan based on its specific situation, formulate a plan for streamlining the organization, and submit the plan to the masses of employees for debate. In the great debate, promote correct views, criticize incorrect views, accept correct opinions, supplement and revise the plan, and then resolutely implement it. We believe that if farms and ranches across the country carry out this major reform, they will surely significantly improve their operation and management, and they will surely play a better exemplary role for agricultural producers' cooperatives.

### 农场管理上的重大改革

    农场管理上的重大改革
    在国营农场中，脱离生产的人员在全场职工中间占的比例越小越好。这是容易明白的道理。但是，究竟这个比例小到什么程度就不能再小了？说法可就不一样了。不久以前，地方国营北京南郊农场、西郊农场和东郊畜牧场，经过慎重考虑、周密调查，下决心大大减少脱离生产人员。南郊农场把脱离生产人员从八十九人减少到十六人，只占目前职工总数的1.2％。西郊农场把脱离生产人员从七十一人减少到十三人，只占目前职工总数1.9％。东郊畜牧场把脱离生产人员从一百二十人减少到十三人，只占目前职工总数1.5％。这应该看做是国营农场事业上的一项重大改革。这件事，对于全国各地的国营农场和牧场都有重大的意义。
    把脱离生产人员精简到最低的必要的数目，无疑是有很多好处的。最明显的好处就是可以大大节约开支，降低生产成本。大家都知道，我国的国营农场和牧场，几年来在开垦荒地、增产农产品和畜产品、培养干部等方面已经做出了很大的成绩。但是，各地农场和牧场都还存在着一个致命的问题，就是生产成本过高，劳动生产率较低，完不成上缴利润计划。造成这种情况的重要原因之一，就是机构庞大，脱离生产人员过多，管理费用和工资在全部支出中所占比重太大。据今年2月间全国国营农牧场工作会议反映，全国国营农牧场的行政管理人员，在职工总数中所占的比重，一般都在10％以上，有的竟超过了20％。从今年春季起，各地农牧场在精简机构方面开始做了一些努力，但是，多数农牧场的管理机构还是相当庞大，脱离生产人员还是太多。黑龙江省八个国营农场经过春季的初步精简以后，脱离生产人员比过去减少了10％到15％，但是仍然占职工总数的11％。在其他地区的农牧场中，脱离生产人员经过精简以后仍占职工总数5％以上的单位也有很多。能不能再减少呢？许多农牧场的领导方面下不了这个决心。现在，事实摆在这里，大家看吧，既然北京南郊农场能够把脱产人员数目由占职工总数的7.3％精简到1.2％，西郊农场能够把脱离生产人员数目由占职工总数的11.7％精简到1.9％，东郊畜牧场能够把脱离生产人员数目由占职工总数的13.3％精简到1.5％，那末，别的农场和牧场为什么不能这样做呢？
    这样做，会不会削弱农场和牧场的领导、影响它们的生产和管理工作呢？北京南郊农场、西郊农场和东郊畜牧场的事实已经作了回答：这样做了以后，不但没有削弱领导工作，而且大大克服或者减少了官僚主义，大大地密切了干部和群众的联系，使领导力量更加深入群众、深入生产。“人多好办事”的观点在这个事实面前是破产了。人多不一定就能把事情办好。许多农牧场正是由于管理机构庞大、领导层次重叠、人浮于事，才发展了官僚主义和文牍主义现象。在这些企业里，会议极其频繁，表报文件极其庞杂，形成一种沉重的压力，使得领导人员很难深入下层、深入生产过程，不能及时解决生产中的问题。精简了管理机构，减少了脱产人员，自然就非挤掉不必要的会议和表报不可，领导人员也就可以摆脱办公室里的无形的绳索，就可以到生产中去，切实有效地领导生产。北京市南郊农场、西郊农场和东郊畜牧场在机构没有精简以前，管理机构庞大，非生产人员过多，许多事情推来推去，不得及时处理；精简机构以后，把脑力劳动和体力劳动更好地结合起来，坐办公室的人少了，行政工作、政治工作由党委、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部负责去做；干部下地劳动以后，有很多问题随时就能解决，工作效率比从前提高了。
    当然，在彻底精简组织机构、减少工作人员、改进工作方法的时候，不会不碰到一些思想障碍。有些工作人员可能对于参加生产劳动有不正确的看法，他们仍然轻视体力劳动。要解决这个问题，必须做好思想教育工作。这可以同整风密切地结合起来进行。这个工作也就是整风运动的重要部分。思想问题解决了，人们就会愉快地走出办公室，投入生产劳动中去，并且从劳动中得到宝贵的锻炼。北京南郊农场的技术人员，过去每月要用很多时间在办公室里写技术措施计划、生产总结等等；现在他们能够深入田间，一面劳动，一面进行技术指导，受到了工人们的欢迎，而他们自己也学到了很多在书本上难以学到的具体生产知识和劳动本领。
    北京南郊农场、西郊农场和东郊畜牧场已经为全国农、牧场作出了良好的榜样，一切国营农场和牧场都应该学习这个榜样，根据勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的原则，在整风中迅速完成精简机构的工作。为了做好这项工作，各场应该立即根据自己的具体情况，进行全面规划，制定出精简机构的方案，并且把方案交给职工群众，展开辩论。在大辩论中，发扬正确的观点，批判错误的观点，接受正确的意见，对方案加以补充修改，然后坚决贯彻实行。我们相信，全国农场和牧场如果都进行了这项重大改革，一定会显著地改善经营管理状况，一定会对农业生产合作社起更好的示范作用。
