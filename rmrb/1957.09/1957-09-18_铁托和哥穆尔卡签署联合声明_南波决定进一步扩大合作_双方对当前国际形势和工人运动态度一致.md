Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 17th - Following talks between the delegations of the parties and governments of Yugoslavia and Poland, Tito and Gomulka signed a joint statement of the Yugoslav and Polish parties and governments in Belgrade on the morning of the 16th.

The statement said that during the talks, the two sides discussed issues related to further developing Yugoslav-Polish relations, unresolved issues in the international situation, and issues in the current international workers' movement. The representatives of both sides held consistent attitudes on the issues discussed during the talks.

The statement said that the two governments noted that due to the persistent struggle of all peaceful forces, some improvements have been made in international relations recently. However, the current situation shows that further efforts should be made to eliminate the dangers to peace arising from the current hotbeds of conflict (especially in the Near East). The two governments emphasized that they firmly pursue a policy of constructive cooperation among all peoples based on the principles of respecting sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, equality, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    The two governments emphasized the significant role played by socialist countries and socialist forces in paving the way for the principles of coexistence and consolidating peace.

The statement pointed out that in the current international situation, the issue of disarmament is of great significance to the cause of peace. The two governments are convinced that continued efforts must be made to reach at least preliminary and partial agreements in order to open the way for a comprehensive solution to this issue. The two governments will support all positive initiatives in this regard.

Both sides believe that reaching an agreement on the prohibition of the production and use of atomic and thermonuclear weapons is extremely important.

Both sides believe that the issue of European collective security and the German question are also closely related to the issue of easing tensions. The reunification of Germany into a peaceful and democratic country would be a great contribution to the stability of world peace. The two governments advocate that in order to solve the German problem, it is first necessary to re-establish contact and direct negotiations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Yugoslav government believes that the current Oder-Neisse border, demarcated by the Potsdam Resolution and recognized by the German Democratic Republic, is the final Polish-German border.

Regarding the situation in the Near East, both sides believe that the threat to peace has recently re-emerged there, and various forms of pressure, especially on Syria, which is pursuing an independent policy, are continuing.

The two governments agree that there is an urgent need to provide economic and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries without political conditions attached, while respecting the sovereignty and independence of these countries.

In the spirit of enhancing the prestige and operational efficiency of the United Nations, the two governments believe that the People's Republic of China must occupy its rightful seat in the United Nations.

The statement pointed out that the historical process of establishing new socialist social relations began with the Great October Revolution. For forty years, the construction of socialist society has become the daily practical undertaking of millions of working people in countries where the working class is in power. The future destiny of the struggle for peace and socialism requires strengthening the ties and cooperation between communist and workers' parties and among socialist countries, establishing unity in the workers' movement, and developing cooperation with all progressive forces in the world.

In order to further expand cooperation, the two governments decided that, when necessary, especially when the interests of the peace and security of the two peoples require it, they will consult on the establishment of a Yugoslav-Polish Economic Cooperation Committee, devote themselves to expanding cultural and scientific cooperation, and open cultural information centers in Belgrade and Warsaw.

The statement concluded that the two delegations expressed their belief that the development of this comprehensive cooperation between the two countries will help further the closeness and fraternal relations between the two peoples, contribute to the socialist construction of the two countries, and strengthen the cooperation between socialist countries and progressive forces throughout the world.

　　双方对当前国际形势和工人运动态度一致
    据新华社贝尔格莱德17日电　在南斯拉夫和波兰两国的党和政府代表团举行了会谈以后，铁托和哥穆尔卡16日上午在贝尔格莱德签署了南波两党和政府的联合声明。
    声明说，双方在会谈中讨论了有关进一步发展南波关系的问题、国际局势中的悬而未决的问题和当前国际工人运动的问题。双方代表对于在会谈期间所讨论的问题的态度是一致的。
    声明说，两国政府注意到，由于一切和平力量的坚持斗争，最近在国际关系方面取得了一些改善。不过，今天的局势显示应该进一步作出努力，来消除从目前的冲突温床（特别是在近东）产生的对和平的危险。两国政府着重指出，它们根据尊重主权、独立、领土完整、平等和不干涉其他国家内政的原则，坚决奉行各国人民之间进行建设性合作的政策。
    两国政府着重指出了社会主义国家和社会主义力量在为共处的原则和巩固和平的斗争铺平道路方面所起的重大作用。
    声明指出，在目前的国际局势下，裁军问题对和平事业具有非常重大的意义。两国政府深信必须继续努力以求至少达成初步和局部的协议，为这个问题的全盘解决打开道路。两国政府将支持这方面的一切积极倡议。
    双方认为，在禁止生产和使用原子武器和热核武器问题上达成协议是极其重要的。
    双方认为，欧洲集体安全问题和德国问题同缓和紧张局势的问题也有密切关系。使德国重新统一成为一个和平和民主的国家，对于世界和平的稳定将是一个巨大的贡献。两国政府主张，为了解决德国问题，首先必须重新在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间建立接触，并进行直接谈判。
    南斯拉夫政府认为，波茨坦决议划定的、德意志民主共和国承认的、现在的奥得—尼斯河边界是最后的波德边界。
    关于近东的情况，双方认为，最近在那里又产生了对和平的威胁，各种形式的压力、特别是对奉行独立政策的叙利亚的压力，正在继续中。
    两国政府一致认为迫切需要给予不发达国家经济和技术援助而不附带政治条件，同时尊重这些国家的主权和独立。
    两国政府本着提高联合国组织的威信和行动效率的愿望，认为中华人民共和国在联合国组织中必须占有它应得的席位。
    声明指出，建立新的社会主义社会关系的历史过程是从伟大的十月革命开始的。四十年来，社会主义社会的建设已经成为工人阶级当权的国家中千百万劳动人民日常实践的事业。争取和平和社会主义的斗争的今后的命运，要求加强共产党、工人党之间以及社会主义国家之间的联系和合作，要求建立工人运动的团结，要求发展同世界上一切进步力量的合作。
    为了进一步扩大合作，两国政府决定，在必要的时候，特别是在两国人民的和平和安全的利益需要的时候，协商建立南斯拉夫—波兰经济合作委员会，致力于扩大文化和科学合作，并且要在贝尔格莱德和华沙开辟文化情报中心。
    声明最后说，双方代表团表示相信，两国间这种全面合作的发展有助于两国人民的进一步接近和兄弟关系的发展，有助于两国的社会主义建设，以及社会主义国家和全世界进步力量的合作的加强。
