Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 22nd: The Hungarian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 21st, saying that the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly special session regarding the so-called "Hungarian question" is another attempt to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and serves the policies of the United States. This resolution has no legal effect and therefore cannot bind the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people will never allow anyone to interfere in their internal affairs in the future.

The Hungarian Foreign Ministry believes that none of the arguments raised in the United Nations General Assembly debate have not already been refuted by the Hungarian government with conclusive evidence and legally irrefutable arguments. However, the drafters of the resolution repeatedly attempted to cover up historical facts with slander. The statement pointed out that they have exhausted all means to continue creating unrest in Hungary and disrupting the peaceful labor of the Hungarian people. This shows that they not only want to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs but also want to support the defeated counter-revolutionary fascist forces. The Foreign Ministry statement also pointed out that the United States and some Western countries did not hesitate to use diplomatic pressure to obtain votes at the meeting. Despite this, the vote count still shows that the governments representing the majority of the world's population did not support this resolution.

The statement said that the imperialist bloc frequently needs to raise the "Hungarian question" as an excuse to divert international attention in the United Nations General Assembly and other political occasions. We are very clear that most of the countries that approved the resolution voted in favor under the pressure of American imperialism or were deceived by the Special Committee.

The statement said that the Hungarian Foreign Ministry believes that among the majority of United Nations member states, the forces demanding peace and the easing of international tensions will surely prevail and will soon see that attempts to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs will not help ease international tensions. Therefore, the absurd report on the "Hungarian question" and the related resolutions will be thrown into the dustbin of history.

The Foreign Ministry's statement concluded by saying that the United Nations' 12th General Assembly should cancel the discussion on the "Hungarian question" and instead discuss truly mature international issues.

    匈外交部发表声明
    匈牙利内政不允许任何人干涉  联大决议将被丢进历史垃圾箱
    据新华社布达佩斯22日电　匈牙利外交部21日发表声明说，联合国大会特别会议通过的关于所谓“匈牙利问题”的决议是再一次企图干涉匈牙利的内政，它是为美国的政策服务的。这个决议没有任何法律效力，因此，它不能对匈牙利人民起约束作用。匈牙利人民今后也决不会允许任何人干涉自己的内政。
    匈牙利外交部认为，联合国大会辩论中所提出的论点，没有一个不是已经被匈牙利政府以确凿的证据和在法律上无可反驳的论点所否定了的，但是决议草案的提出者仍然一再企图以诬蔑来掩盖历史事实。声明指出，他们用尽一切手段企图在匈牙利继续制造不安，扰乱匈牙利人民的和平劳动。这说明了他们不仅想干涉匈牙利内政，而且想给失败了的反革命法西斯力量撑腰。外交部的声明还指出，美国和一些西方国家为了在会上取得票数，不惜使用了外交压力。虽然如此，从票数上仍然可以看出，代表世界人口多数的政府并没有支持这个决议。
    声明说，帝国主义集团所以经常需要提出“匈牙利问题”，是想以此作为借口来在联合国大会以及在其他政治场合转移国际注意力。我们很清楚：赞成决议的国家中大部分都是在美帝国主义的压力下或者是受了特别委员会的欺骗才投赞成票的。
    声明说，匈牙利外交部相信在联合国会员国的多数中，要求和平和缓和国际紧张局势的力量必定会胜利，并且会很快看清干涉匈牙利内政的尝试不会有助于缓和国际紧张局势。因此，关于“匈牙利问题”的荒谬报告和有关的决议将被投入到历史的垃圾箱中。
    外交部的声明最后表示，联合国第十二届大会应当取消对“匈牙利问题”的讨论，而去讨论真正的成熟了的国际问题。
