    Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangxi Province has completed the harvesting of early and mid-season rice, with a total output increase of 250 million jin compared to last year.
    According to the head of the provincial agricultural department: This year, Jiangxi Province planted early and mid-season rice on more than 26 million mu. Except for some areas where mid-season rice production was slightly reduced due to disasters, most areas had a bumper harvest. Agricultural cooperatives in the Poyang Lake plain and the Gan River basin generally achieved early rice yields of 400 to 500 jin per mu. Xingzi County, a model unit that won the national double-cropping rice bumper harvest last year, achieved an average yield of 450 jin per mu on 98,000 mu of early rice, an increase of more than 9% over last year. Every township and cooperative in the county had a bumper harvest and increased production.
    Currently, nearly 10 million mu of single-season late rice is growing well and is in the grouting stage. The planting plan for double-season late rice and other late autumn crops, covering more than 15.7 million mu, has been completed, an increase of 610,000 mu over last year. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions are strengthening field management to strive for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops.

    Xinhua News Agency report: A reporter learned from the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Department that the total output of early and mid-season rice in the province this year is estimated to increase by more than 10% compared to last year.
    Many hilly and mountainous areas in Hunan Province, which previously had low yields, have seen large-scale bumper harvests this year. For example, Pingjiang County achieved an average yield of 440 jin of rice per mu on more than 190,000 mu of mid-season rice, an increase of about 20 jin per mu compared to the bumper harvest last year, setting a record high. In the western mountainous areas of Qianyang, Xupu, and other seven counties and cities, the average yield of more than 160,000 mu of harvested mid-season rice was 455 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 1,033 jin. In the three special districts of Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Chenxian, which suffered from drought last year and this year, after 50 days of drought resistance, the mid-season rice yield in most areas was around 400 jin.
    According to statistics from the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Department: This year, the average yield of more than 12 million mu of early rice in the province was 380 jin per mu, an increase of 4% over last year. Now, most of the 34 million mu of mid-season rice has been harvested. Except for a small number of areas with low yields due to drought, the general yield per mu is above 400 jin.
    The good harvest of early and mid-season rice this year is another great achievement for Hunan Province after realizing advanced cooperativization. When the mid-season rice was heading, severe drought occurred in many places, and the drought-affected area in the province reached 16 million mu. However, agricultural cooperatives organized more than 3.4 million laborers to carry out drought resistance day and night, and finally rescued most of the drought-affected rice fields.

### 湖南江西早稻中稻都增产

    湖南江西早稻中稻都增产
    据新华社讯　江西省早、中稻已经收割完毕，总产量比去年增加二亿五千万斤。
    据省农业部门负责人说：今年江西省早、中稻播种面积二千六百多万亩，除部分地区中稻因受灾稍有减产外，绝大部分地区都丰收。鄱阳湖滨平原及赣江流域一带的农业合作社，早稻产量一般都有四百斤到五百斤。曾获得去年全国双季稻丰产的模范单位星子县，九万八千亩早稻平均单位面积产量有四百五十斤，比去年又提高了9％以上，全县乡乡丰收，社社增产。
    现在，近一千万亩一季晚稻也都生长良好，正在灌浆。二季晚稻等晚秋作物也已经完成了一千五百七十多万亩的播种计划，比去年增加了六十一万亩。各地农业社正在加强田间管理，力争晚秋作物丰收。
    据新华社讯　记者从湖南省农业部门获悉，今年全省早、中稻总产量估计可比去年增产一成多。
    湖南省许多过去产量不高的丘陵山区今年出现大面积的丰产纪录，例如平江县十九万多亩中稻平均每亩产谷四百四十斤，比大丰收的去年平均每亩增产约二十斤，创历年来的最高纪录。西部山区的黔阳、溆浦等七个县市已收割的十六万多亩中稻平均每亩四百五十五斤，最高的达一千零三十三斤。去年和今年都曾受到干旱的邵阳、衡阳、郴县等三个专区，经过今年五十天的抗旱斗争，大部分地区中稻产量都在四百斤左右。
    据湖南省农业部门统计：今年全省一千二百多万亩早稻平均每亩产三百八十斤，比去年增产4％。现在，三千四百万亩中稻也已大部分收割完毕，除少数因受旱灾产量较低外，一般每亩产量都在四百斤以上。
    今年各地早、中稻收成好，是湖南省实现高级合作化后的又一个巨大成绩。中稻抽穗时，许多地方发生了严重的旱情，全省受旱面积曾达一千六百万亩，但是，农业社组织三百四十多万劳动大军夜以继日地展开抗旱斗争，终于使绝大部分受旱稻田得到抢救。
