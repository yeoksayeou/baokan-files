Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: According to an Associated Press report from Cairo on September 27th, Egyptian President Nasser said that if any aggression were to occur against Syria, Egypt would support Syria by all means.

Nasser pointed out, during a meeting with reporters from the Associated Press and NBC, that Egypt and Syria have a defense agreement to resist aggression. He clarified that the manner in which Egypt would aid Syria would be determined by the nature of the aggression.

Nasser also reiterated Egypt's policy of active neutrality.

When asked if he was willing to meet with U.S. President Eisenhower to discuss the Near East issue, Nasser replied that he did not want to suggest such a meeting, "but I am ready to do anything possible for the cause of peace, and if Eisenhower initiates it, I would not object to meeting with him."

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th, Damascus dispatch: Saudi Arabian King Saud issued a statement on the evening of September 26th saying that Saudi Arabia will support Syria in resisting any aggression. He left Damascus on the 27th to return to Riyadh.

King Saud's statement was issued after two days of talks with Syrian government leaders. He said in the statement: "I will condemn any aggression against Syria; and I publicly, clearly, and sincerely announce to everyone that I will fight alongside Syria or any other Arab brother country against aggression from any quarter that may threaten any of these countries or their independence."

The statement also pointed out that Syria cannot threaten any of its neighbors. Syria's policy towards Arab countries is based on the Arab League Charter, its relations with other Arab countries comply with the Arab Collective Security Pact, and its international relations are based on the United Nations Charter.

In the statement, King Saud called for Arab unity in the face of threats.

The content of the talks between King Saud and Syrian government leaders has not been officially released. According to information obtained by Reuters, King Saud explained in detail Saudi Arabia's contacts with the United States during the talks and guaranteed support for Syria. On the other hand, Syrian leaders explained to Saudi Arabia the recent developments in Syria, detailed the U.S. diplomatic officials' conspiracy to subvert the Syrian government, and explained the contents of the Soviet-Syrian economic aid agreement, pointing out that the agreement was unconditional.

Reuters also reported that the talks discussed the issues of Algeria, Palestine, and the Gulf of Aqaba, and it was believed that Arabs must be united on such issues. In addition, the two leaders also discussed Oman, British aggression against Yemen, and the Buraimi Oasis issue.

    新华社27日讯　　据美联社开罗27日消息：埃及总统纳赛尔说，如果发生对叙利亚进行的任何侵略，埃及将以一切办法支持叙利亚。
    纳赛尔在接见美联社和美国全国广播公司记者时指出，埃及同叙利亚是订有抵抗侵略的防御协定的。他说明，埃及援助叙利亚的办法将由侵略的性质来决定。
    纳赛尔还重申埃及采取的积极中立政策。
    记者问他是否愿意同美国总统艾森豪威尔会谈中近东问题，纳赛尔回答说，他不想建议举行这样的会谈，“但是我准备为和平事业做任何可能做的事情，假如艾森豪威尔倡议的话，我不反对同他会谈”。

    声明还指出，叙利亚不可能威胁它的任何邻国。叙利亚对阿拉伯国家的政策是以阿拉伯联盟盟章为根据的，它同其他阿拉伯国家的关系符合阿拉伯国家集体安全公约，它的国际关系是以联合国宪章为基础的。
