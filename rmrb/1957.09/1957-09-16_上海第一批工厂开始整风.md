　　Shanghai First Batch of Factories Start Rectification
    The experience of three pilot factories proves that as long as the leading cadres sincerely rely on the masses, the workers will speak freely; carrying out the rectification movement will not only not affect production, but the attendance rate of workers is even higher than in the past.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 15th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhongni) reported: Shanghai, with more than 17,000 factories, is taking a step-by-step approach to carry out rectification and socialist education movements.
    As early as early August, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China selected three factories to take the lead in order to gain experience in mobilizing the masses for open rectification. Now, the first batch of thirty factories, including state-owned, locally state-owned, old joint ventures, and new joint ventures of different types, have prepared for the rectification and have begun rectification mobilization. It is planned that about one hundred and several dozen factories in the second batch will also begin preparations.
    The experience of the three pilot factories—Shanghai Turbine Factory, Shanghai First Cotton Textile Factory, and Shanghai Ship Repairing Factory—eliminated some cadres' concerns that rectification would disrupt production. In the rectification preparation work, these factories carefully arranged the production tasks for the second half of the year, designated some people in advance to be responsible for grasping production during the rectification period, emphasized to the masses the importance of not delaying both rectification and production, and stipulated that all rectification activities must be carried out outside of production time. Any opinions on the leadership could be raised, but in production and work, one must obey the command of leaders at all levels. In the past month, the attendance rate of these factories has increased during the enthusiastic airing of views, labor discipline has improved, and the vast majority of technicians have been conscientious and responsible in their work, with normal production order.
    The experience of the pilot factories also eliminated some cadres' concerns that airing of views would not be possible after the anti-rightist struggle was launched in society. In the rectification preparation work, these factories focused on ideological education to enhance the leading cadres' understanding of rectification and correct their attitude towards rectification, so that they could establish the determination to sincerely rely on the masses to improve their work and style. At the same time, they also made a detailed account to the masses of the situation of earnestly improving their work and style based on the criticisms and opinions raised by the masses in the previous period when mobilizing for rectification. In this way, the workers further increased their confidence in the rectification. Three or four days after mobilizing for rectification, a climax of great airing and great contending was formed, and the vast majority of workers and technicians had already spoken freely. Most of the opinions raised by the workers were pertinent, and they also revealed many shortcomings and errors that the leaders had not previously discovered. The workers also extensively raised various different views and opinions on all aspects of the worker-peasant alliance, policies, legal system, diplomacy, and so on.
    The experience of the pilot factories fully demonstrated the great effectiveness of mobilizing the masses and open rectification. Cadres and party members received extremely profound education during the airing of views, and many cadres and party members gratefully expressed their determination to the masses to correct their shortcomings and errors. The leadership recorded and sorted out the opinions of the masses day by day, classified them and handed them over to the relevant departments and personnel, and included them in the agenda for improving work; those that could be improved immediately were acted upon immediately. The First Cotton Mill also published the progress and situation of rectification and correction on a daily basis in conspicuous places.
    In many problems and opinions raised in big-character posters and forums, the pilot factories found some problems that were commonly noticed by the masses and used them as topics for conducting socialist education among the masses. Enthusiastic discussions have now begun.
    At present, the rectification movement of the first batch of thirty factories is rapidly and smoothly unfolding.

　　上海第一批工厂开始整风
    三个先行厂的经验证明：只要领导干部真诚地依靠群众，职工就会畅所欲言；开展整风运动不仅不会影响生产，工人的出勤率比过去更高了
    据新华社上海15日电  新华社记者徐中尼报道：有一万七千多个工厂的上海市正在采取分批分期的办法进行整风和社会主义教育运动。
    中共上海市委员会早在8月上旬选择三个厂先行一步，吸取发动群众公开整风的经验。现在，第一批包括国营、地方国营、老合营、新合营等不同类型的三十个厂，已经作好整风准备工作，并开始了整风动员；预定在第二批进行整风的约一百几十个厂，现在也都开始了准备工作。
    先行一步的三个厂——国营上海汽轮机厂、上海第一棉纺织厂、上海船舶修造厂的经验，消除了一些干部认为整风会搞乱生产的顾虑。这些厂在整风准备工作中，认真地安排了下半年的生产任务，事先指定一部分人在整风时期负责抓生产，向群众着重说明了整风和生产两不误的重要性，并且规定一切整风活动必须在生产以外的时间进行，对领导的任何意见都可以提，但是在生产、工作中必须服从各级领导人员的指挥。一个月来，这些厂在热烈鸣放中出勤率比以前提高，劳动纪律更好了，绝大部分技职人员工作认真负责，生产秩序很正常。
    先行厂的经验也消除了一些干部认为在社会上反右派斗争展开以后鸣放不起来的顾虑。这些厂在整风准备工作中，着重进行了提高领导干部对整风的认识、端正整风态度的思想教育工作，使他们树立起真心诚意依靠群众改进工作和改进作风的决心。同时，还把根据群众前一时期提出的批评和意见认真地改进工作和作风的情况，在动员整风的时候向群众逐一地作出交代。这样，职工们更加提高了整风的信心。在动员整风的三、四天以后，大鸣大放的高潮就形成了，绝大部分工人和技职人员已经畅所欲言。职工提出的意见绝大部分是中肯的，并且揭发出许多领导人员原先没有发现的缺点和错误。职工群众还在工农联盟、政策、法制、外交等各个方面，广泛地提出了各种不同的看法和意见。
    先行厂的经验，充分说明了发动群众、公开整风的巨大成效。干部和党员在鸣放中受到了极深刻的教育，许多干部和党员感激地向群众表示了改正缺点和错误的决心。领导上对群众的意见逐日逐一地记录整理，分类交给有关部门和人员，列入改进工作的日程；能够马上改进的就立即行动起来。国棉一厂还在显著的地方每天公布边整边改的进程和情况。
    先行厂在大字报、座谈会上所提出的许多问题和意见中，找到了一些为群众共同注意的问题，作为向群众进行社会主义教育的课题。现在已经开始展开了热烈的讨论。
    目前，第一批三十个厂的整风运动正在迅速顺利的展开。
