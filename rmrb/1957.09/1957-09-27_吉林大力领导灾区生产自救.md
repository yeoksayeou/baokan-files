    Jilin Vigorously Leads Disaster Area in Production for Self-Relief
    (Our Reporter Tang Baoshun) Party and government leading organs at all levels in Jilin Province are actively leading disaster victims in production for self-relief to make up for losses caused by the disaster.
    As of early September, the area of land in Jilin Province affected by floods reached more than 510,000 hectares, with more than 900 livestock deaths, more than 480 destroyed water conservancy projects, and more than 30,000 houses destroyed. In order to promptly solve the difficulties of disaster victims in production and life, and vigorously carry out production for self-relief, all counties have generally established production and disaster relief committees, led personally by the county party secretary and the county head. In the severely affected areas, production for self-relief has been listed as the central task of the countryside. The Gongzhuling Special District organized more than 110,000 people to participate in dike restoration, breach plugging, and the elimination of internal waterlogging. Currently, more than 7,500 hectares of land have been drained of internal waterlogging, more than 160 breaches have been repaired, along with 12 reservoirs and more than 110,000 meters of river dikes. In addition, some residential buildings have been repaired, so that the vast majority of disaster victims have been resettled. After Yitong County was hit by the disaster, it immediately organized more than 3,000 laborers to rescue crops washed down by the water, and more than 100 hectares of crops have now been propped up. Many agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas have discussed specific methods for increasing grain production, overcoming waste, and surviving the famine during the autumn harvest. Dunhua County proposed methods such as careful cutting, careful harvesting, and careful threshing, which can increase the harvest by more than 1,700 tons of grain.
    In order to increase the income of disaster victims, the leading organs of various counties have adopted various methods to find avenues for sideline production for disaster victims. Baicheng County has found dozens of sideline production opportunities for disaster victims, such as quarrying stones, digging medicinal materials, working as porters, and stone masonry. It is planned that the county can increase its sideline income by 2 million yuan before March next year. More than 1,300 people in the county have already gone out to participate in various sideline production activities. The sideline income of Lishu County has reached more than 276,000 yuan. In the first ten days of September, the sideline income of seven townships including Naerhong in Jingyu County reached more than 60,000 yuan. Dunhua County is about to organize 5,000 to 7,000 people to participate in various sideline production activities in the forest, such as cleaning forest farms, collecting mountain products, and building firebreaks. The county plans to increase its sideline income by more than 4.1 million yuan by next spring, which can completely compensate for or exceed the losses caused by the disaster.

    吉林大力领导灾区生产自救
    本报讯　记者汤宝顺报道：吉林省各级党政领导机关积极领导灾民生产自救，弥补受灾损失。
    到9月上旬为止，吉林省遭到水灾的土地面积达五十一万多公顷，死亡牲畜九百多头，冲毁水利工程四百八十多处、房屋三万多间。为了及时解决灾民生产、生活中的困难，大力开展生产自救工作，各县普遍建立了生产救灾委员会，并由县委书记、县长亲自负责领导。在重灾区，已把生产自救列为当前农村中心工作。公主岭专区曾组织了十一万多人参加复堤堵口和排除内涝积水工作。现在已经排除内涝积水七千五百多公顷地、修复决口一百六十多处、水库十二座、河堤十一万多公尺。并且修复了一部分住宅，使绝大多数灾民得到安置。伊通县受灾以后，立即组织了三千多名劳动力抢救被水冲倒的庄稼，现在已经扶起一百多公顷的庄稼。许多受灾地区的农业社讨论了秋收中如何注意增产粮食、克服浪费、度过灾荒的具体办法。敦化县提出细割、细收、细打等办法，即可增收一千七百多吨粮食。
    为了增加灾民的收入，各县的领导机关采取了各种办法为灾民寻找副业生产门路。白城县为灾民找出打石头、挖药材、拉脚、打石等几十种副业生产，计划到明年3月以前全县可增加二百万元的副业收入。全县已经有一千三百多人外出参加了各种副业生产。梨树县副业收入已达到二十七万六千多元。靖宇县那尔轰等七个乡到9月上旬，副业收入就达到六万多元。敦化县即将组织五千到七千人到森林里参加清理林场、采山货、打防火线等各种副业生产，全县计划到明年春季增加副业收入四百一十多万元，完全可以弥补或超过受灾损失。“
