Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The Associated Press reported on September 27th that Egyptian President Nasser, in a meeting with reporters from the Associated Press and NBC, reiterated Egypt's full support for Syria.

    He told American reporters, "We have a mutual defense agreement with Syria against aggression, and in the event of any aggression against Syria, Egypt will take all measures to support Syria. But what those measures will be depends on the nature of the aggression." In response to a question about Egypt's foreign policy, Nasser said: "Since we are independent, we have adopted a policy of non-alignment. Our policy is to examine each issue to see if it is right or wrong, and to support all countries in gaining self-determination and independence. But this does not mean being neutral between capitalism and communism. We have already implemented a capitalist system in Egypt." He also said, "We have adopted a policy of non-participation in blocs in international affairs, and we believe that this policy will contribute to the cause of peace and help end the Cold War."

    Nasser said, in discussing relations with the United States, "I am not opposed to holding a meeting with Eisenhower if he takes the initiative." He added, "I am prepared to do anything possible for the cause of peace."

    He said, "We are prepared to do anything except abandon our sovereignty and dignity. But it seems that the purpose of American policy is to isolate Egypt and continue to exert economic pressure on Egypt." He also stated that "regardless of whether the United States agrees or not," Egypt already has ways to recover its assets frozen in the United States. He said that within two or three months, the plan will be clear.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 28th: "Al-Ahram" newspaper on the 27th accused the U.S. government of putting pressure on Britain and France to prevent their exploratory economic talks with Egypt from making progress.

    The newspaper quoted a British minister as saying that Dulles had told him: While the United States is trying to close its door to Nasser, if Nasser is actually able to "open a door" in his relations with Britain, "that would mean he has broken the Western blockade that we are trying to impose on him."

    However, the French government, disregarding American pressure, is still continuing its talks with Egypt. It is reported that French officials told the American ambassador in Paris that France could not afford to delay its talks with Egypt. The Egyptian assets frozen by France are less than 100,000 pounds, while the French assets frozen in Egypt are nearly 150 million pounds.

    纳赛尔重申全面支持叙利亚
    埃及有办法收回被美国冻结的财产
    据新华社28日讯　美联社9月27日报道，埃及总统纳赛尔在接见美联社和美国全国广播公司的记者时，重申埃及对叙利亚的全面支持。
    他告诉美国记者说，“我们同叙利亚缔结有一项关于反对侵略的防务协定，一旦发生任何对叙利亚的侵略，埃及将采取一切手段支援叙利亚。但是到底是什么手段，那就要看到底是那一种侵略了。”　在答复关于埃及的外交政策时，纳赛尔说：“既然我们是独立的，我们便采取了不结盟的政策。我们的政策是要研究每一个问题看看它是对还是不对，和支持一切国家获得自决和独立。但是这并不意味着在资本主义和共产主义之间保持中立。我们已经在埃及实行了资本主义制度。”他还说，“我们在国际事务中采取了不参加集团的政策，并且相信这种政策会有助于和平事业、有助于结束冷战。”
    纳赛尔在谈到同美国的关系时说，“我并不反对和艾森豪威尔举行会议，如果他采取主动的话。”他又说，“我是准备为和平事业做任何可能的事情的。”
    他说，“除了放弃我们的主权和尊严以外，我们预备作任何事情。但是看来美国的政策的目的似乎是要孤立埃及，继续对埃及施加经济压力。”他还说，“不论美国同意与否”，埃及已经有办法收回它在美国被冻结的财产。他说，在两三个月内，计划将会明确的。
    据新华社开罗28日电　“金字塔报”27日指责美国政府向英法两国施加压力，阻止它们同埃及间的探讨性经济会谈取得进展。
    这家报纸援引英国一位大臣的话说，杜勒斯曾经对他说：正当美国努力向纳赛尔关闭它的大门的时候，如果纳赛尔居然能够在同英国的关系上“打开大门”，“那就意味着他打破了我们设法加在他身上的西方封锁”。
    但是，法国政府却不顾美国的压力，仍在继续进行它同埃及的会谈。据报道，法国官员对美国驻巴黎大使说，拖延同埃及进行的会谈，法国是吃不消的。法国冻结的埃及资产不足十万镑，而冻结在埃及的法国资产却将近一亿五千万镑。
