The Broad Masses are Full of Fighting Spirit; Right-Wingers' Conspiracies are Fully Exposed
People of All Nationalities in Inner Mongolia Pursue and Strike the Right-Wingers While Capitalizing on the Victory

(Our Newspaper News) The people of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are actively participating in the anti-rightist struggle. Over the past two months, approximately 50,000 cadres and workers throughout the region have participated in the struggle. Everyone has received profound class education in the course of reasoning and struggling against the right-wingers. Currently, this movement is developing in depth in the autonomous region's level of government, the cities of Hohhot and Baotou, and various leagues and administrative regions.

The core members of the right-wing group exposed in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Political Consultative Conference, such as Zeng Shixian, Lu Jianfei, and Kong Qingzhen, were several reactionary figures among the personnel who revolted in the former Suiyuan Province. After years of education since liberation, the vast majority of the original revolting personnel have made progress in their thinking and are actively serving the people in various work positions, some even joining the Party and the League. However, right-wingers like Zeng Shixian have always been hostile to the people and the Communist Party. They conspired to use the Autonomous Region People's Political Consultative Conference as a stronghold to expand their reactionary forces, confront the Communist Party, and vainly hoped that once "the situation changes," they could use this as political capital to restore the old reactionary rule. After everyone's exposure and criticism, Kong Qingzhen has begun to confess the conspiratorial activities of this right-wing group.

The industrial and commercial circles of Hohhot City exposed three right-wing groups organized separately by Lu Lianxu, Ren Liyin, and Wu Zizhen. They systematically and planfully sabotaged socialist transformation. The core members of these right-wing groups conspired many times, studied attack "tactics," and exchanged "combat" experiences. When the Wu Zizhen right-wing group gathered, they had someone specifically standing guard. The Ren Liyin right-wing group drove away the public representatives twice in a row.

The right-wing group, masterminded by Gao Gongrun, former chief engineer of the Inner Mongolia Design Institute, and Guo Yuncheng, chief engineer, attempted to seize the leadership of the design institute. Active participants in this group also included four engineers: Dai Xiche, Shen Zunchong, Huang Yung, and Liu Tieming. They tried every means to systematically incite and win over technical personnel to carry out reactionary activities, setting fires everywhere in an attempt to bring down the design institute and turn it into a bourgeois design firm.

Many right-wingers provoked ethnic relations from various aspects, attacked the Party's ethnic policies, and negated the great achievements of the autonomous region over the past ten years. The Mongolian right-winger Rong Xiang, before liberation, authored "Theory of Common Origin of Mongolian and Han," offering advice to Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the Mongolian nationality. After liberation, he did not repent and continued to provoke unity within the Mongolian nationality and between the Mongolian and Han nationalities. After everyone's exposure and criticism, Rong Xiang has begun to lower his head and confess his crimes, making a preliminary self-criticism. The Hui right-winger Cao Menglin was originally a profiteer who made his fortune by trafficking drugs and exploiting the Hui people. According to mass exposure, he spread fallacies such as "The Hui people have not turned over, and the Party and the government do not help the Hui people develop economic undertakings" everywhere to undermine the close relationship between the Hui people and the Communist Party and the People's Government. He also colluded with other capitalists to form a right-wing group to sabotage socialist transformation. The masses refuted this right-winger's lies with a large number of facts.

In the education, medical, news, and art circles of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, some right-wingers have also been exposed. Right-wing core members such as Yang Hongsheng, a student at Inner Mongolia Normal College, Xu Hualou, a medical officer at the Inner Mongolia Health and Epidemic Prevention Station, Li Daohe, deputy director of the political and cultural department of the Inner Mongolia Daily, and Li Jie, deputy head and Party branch secretary of the Baotou Art Troupe, launched attacks on the Party from various aspects. However, in the process of reasoning and struggling by the broad masses, their anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracies and ugly images have been exposed. The people of all nationalities in the autonomous region are taking advantage of the victory to pursue and strike the right-wingers thoroughly. (Lin Mo)

    广大群众斗志昂扬　右派分子阴谋毕露
    内蒙古各族人民乘胜追击右派
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区各族人民积极参加反右派斗争。两个多月来，全区参加斗争的干部和职工约有五万人。大家在同右派分子进行说理斗争中受到了深刻的阶级教育，现在这一运动在自治区一级机关，呼和浩特、包头二市和各盟、行政区正向纵深发展。
    在自治区人民政协所揭露出的右派集团的骨干分子曾士先、卢健飞、孔庆臻等，是原绥远省起义人员中的几个反动人物。原来的起义人员解放后经过多年的教育，绝大多数人的思想已有进步，在各个工作岗位上积极地为人民服务，有的并且入了党，入了团。但曾士先等右派分子却一直仇视人民和共产党，他们阴谋以自治区政协为据点，扩大反动势力，与共产党分庭抗礼，并妄想一旦“变天”，就以此为政治资本，恢复旧日的反动统治。经过大家的揭发和批判，孔庆臻已经开始交代这个右派集团的阴谋活动。
    呼和浩特市工商界揭露出鲁连绪、任立印、吴子珍等分别组织的三个右派集团。他们有组织、有计划地破坏社会主义改造。这些右派集团的骨干多次密谋，研究进攻的“策略”、交流“战斗”的经验。吴子珍右派集团在聚会时，有专人站岗放哨。任立印右派集团曾一连两次赶走公方代表。
    内蒙古设计院前任总工程师高公润、主任工程师郭蕴诚等主谋策划的右派集团，企图夺取设计院的领导。这个集团的积极参加者还有戴希彻、沈遵崇、黄云谷、刘铁熔等四个工程师。他们想尽各种办法，有组织地煽动和拉拢技术人员进行反动活动，到处放火，企图搞垮设计院，把它变成资产阶级的设计事务所。
    许多右派分子从各方面挑拨民族关系，攻击党的民族政策，抹煞自治区十年来的伟大成绩。蒙古族右派分子荣祥，解放前曾著有“蒙汉同源论”，向蒋介石献策压迫蒙古民族，解放后不知悔改，仍然处处挑拨蒙古族内部以及蒙汉民族之间的团结。经过大家揭露和批判，荣祥已经开始低头认罪，作了初步检讨。回族右派分子曹梦麟原是靠贩运毒品，剥削回民起家的奸商。据群众揭发，他曾到处散播“回民没有翻身，党和政府不帮助回族人民发展经济事业”等谬论，来破坏回族人民同共产党和人民政府的亲密关系。他还勾结其他资本家组成右派集团，破坏社会主义改造。群众以大量事实驳斥了这个右派分子的谎言。
    在内蒙古自治区的教育界、医务界、新闻界、艺术界都揭发出一些右派分子。内蒙古师范学院学生杨鸿升，内蒙古卫生防疫站医士徐华楼，内蒙古日报政治文化部副主任李道和，包头文工团副团长、党支部书记李杰等右派骨干分子，从各方面向党发出进攻，但在广大群众的说理斗争过程中，他们反共、反社会主义的阴谋和丑象已被揭露。自治区各族人民正在乘胜追击，给右派分子以彻底打击。（林沫）
