Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 31st, via TASS: Reports from Havana indicate that the raging struggle against the dictator Batista continues in Cuba.

    The Cuban Army Command announced on August 30th that it had engaged in two encounters with insurgents in the mountainous eastern part of the island. The Army General Staff's report stated that six insurgents were killed and several wounded. In Havana alone, police arrested approximately fifty so-called "conspirators" in August. Newspaper commentary stated: "Everyone there hates Batista."

    The "New York Post" described the situation in Havana as follows: "Sandbags are piled on the roof of the Presidential Palace, and tents have been erected, with guards on constant alert day and night. Obstacles have been set up around the naval armory to prevent insurgents from seizing weapons."

    As can be seen from the "New York Post's" report, the dictator Batista is only able to maintain power amidst a sharp domestic political crisis due to American support.

    The United States supports the Batista regime because it needs it to protect the interests of American business people on the island. According to materials from the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. direct investment in Cuba reached $774 million at the end of 1956, second only to its investments in Venezuela and Brazil in Latin America.

    Not long ago, the "New York Times," when discussing U.S. interests in Cuba, pointed out that "due to the large amount of investment in Cuba, sugar exports, and Cuba's strategic significance, the United States has a great stake there…" Therefore, the United States signed a military agreement with Cuba, according to which Batista received tanks and artillery to suppress insurgents.

    古巴人民憎恨美国鹰犬
    反独裁斗争热火朝天
    据新华社1日讯  据塔斯社纽约8月31日讯：来自哈瓦那的消息表明，在古巴，反对独裁者巴蒂斯塔的如火如荼的斗争仍在继续着。
    古巴陆军司令部8月30日宣布，在这个岛东部的山区同起义者打了两次遭遇战。陆军参谋部的战报说，六名起义者被击毙，若干名负伤。8月份仅仅在哈瓦那一地警察就逮捕了约五十名所谓“阴谋分子”。报纸在评论中说：那里“人人都憎恨巴蒂斯塔。”
    “纽约邮报”对哈瓦那的情况做了这样描述：“总统府的屋顶上堆着沙袋，并竖起了帐篷，警卫队昼夜不停地警戒着。海军军械库周围设置了障碍物，以防止起义者夺取武器。”
    从“纽约邮报”的报道中可以看出，只是由于美国支持，独裁者巴蒂斯塔才得以在国内政治危机尖锐的局面下保持住政权。
    美国之所以支持巴蒂斯塔政权，是因为美国需要它来保护美国工商界人士在这个岛上的利益。根据美国商务部的材料，美国在古巴的直接投资在1956年底达到了七亿七千四百万美元，在拉丁美洲，仅次于它在委内瑞拉和巴西的投资。
    不久前，“纽约时报”谈到美国在古巴的利益时指出，“由于在古巴的大量投资、食糖出口和古巴的战略意义，美国在那里下了很大的赌注……”。因而美国同古巴签订了军事协定，根据这个协定，巴蒂斯塔得到用来镇压起义者的坦克和大炮。（附图片）
