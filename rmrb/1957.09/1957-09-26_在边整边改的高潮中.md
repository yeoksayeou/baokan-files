In the rectification movement in forty state-owned factories and mines in the capital, good news about improved work is coming one after another. The workers all say in unison: This rectification really solves problems! Recently, the reporter discovered many vivid examples during interviews.

“Black Tools” Legalized

The workers of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant had been “headache-y” over the tool issue for several years. Many specialized tools designed by the factory's technology section looked exquisite and beautiful, but when they were actually tried on the machine tools, they were often not useful. Zhang Mao, a drilling machine worker in the No. 2 machining workshop, needed a drill jig. When he saw the tool designed by the technology section, he immediately became angry: "How can using this tool meet the quota?" It turned out that this tool was very cumbersome to use, adding a lot of auxiliary work hours, and could only make two parts at a time. The simple tool he made himself with iron plates could make five at a time, and the technology section insisted that he use the issued tool. How could he not be anxious?

It turned out that the technology section only copied from books when designing tools, neither considering the specific circumstances of the workshop's production nor consulting with the workers who used the tools. A lot of labor and materials were spent to manufacture tools that were not suitable, and they had to be thrown into the scrap iron pile.

The tools from the technology section could not be used, and the regulations stipulated that workers were not allowed to make their own tools with materials. The workers had to go to the scrap pile to find some materials and secretly make some tools to use. However, when the technology section found out, they criticized this as “black tools,” which were illegal. This really put the workers in a dilemma, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

In the rectification movement, the workers brought up this old problem again. This time, the technology section took the initiative to hold worker symposiums, humbly listened to opinions, listed the past so-called "black tools" in a catalog as a reference for future tool design, and at the same time decided that future tool manufacturing must be discussed with relevant personnel in the workshop. If the workshop leaders deemed it necessary, the technology section could issue materials for the workers to make their own tools. In this way, the “black tools” were legalized. Recently, the technology section, together with tool adjustment workers and other workers in the No. 2 machining workshop, jointly researched and manufactured a mandrel for lathes. The workers were very happy to get this tool, and they all said: With this tool, we guarantee to complete the task.

Opening the "Door of Convenience"

The dormitories of the No. 1 Automobile Parts Factory employees are on the east side of the factory, but the administrative departments, fearing management troubles, have always stipulated since the establishment of the factory that bicycles are not allowed to enter or exit from the east gate. Workers riding bicycles had to go several miles out of their way to enter and exit the factory from the west gate, day after day, month after month. In winter, the northwest wind, mixed with heavy snow, blew head-on, making it particularly difficult to pedal.

Although the employees had raised many opinions on this matter, the leaders always thought it was a trivial matter and did not take it to heart. During the rectification, the workers raised this issue again. The cadre in charge of this work examined and said: "In the past, we always considered our own convenience in our work, but we considered everyone's convenience too little." After discussion, they immediately changed the bicycle management method and abolished the system prohibiting bicycles from entering and exiting the east gate. This improvement made all bicycle riders feel much more convenient. Old worker Wang Huaxun said: "Although the matter is small, this change saves a lot of trouble!" Someone added: "In the future, we should put the effort of taking detours into production."

A "Rest Room" That Doesn't Cost Money

"The leaders have solved the rest room problem for us!" The linemen of the No. 3 Sub-bureau of the Beijing Municipal Telephone Bureau excitedly spread the news. At noon break that day, more than twenty linemen automatically went to clean the rest room that had just been assigned to them.

Before the rectification movement, the thirty linemen of this bureau only had one rest room. Every morning, when the cable team, trunk line team, and troubleshooting team held meetings in the room, the noise was loud and interfered with each other, making it difficult to study problems. During the break time, the room was crowded. After returning from installing wires outdoors, the linemen could not rest even if they wanted to. Whenever it rained, bicycles with tools were placed in the room, and at this time, the linemen could hardly find a place to stand. The linemen's opinion that "a rest room is needed" had been raised for more than a year, but it did not attract the attention of the leaders.

As soon as the rectification started, the linemen put up big-character posters describing the suffering of not having a rest room. This time, Bureau Chief Lang Wenyu personally came down to understand the situation and found that without spending money, a vacant room could be vacated simply by tidying up the warehouse. The problem was solved in less than three days after the suggestion was made.

"Junk Cars" Unearthed

In early September, in the southwest corner of the Shazikou depot outside Yongdingmen, more than twenty workers dragged three trucks buried in the sand pit and disassembled the tires and parts on them.

These three trucks were dragged from the Malian Dao depot of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company at the end of March this year. At that time, the depot director considered them "junk cars" without checking. For more than five months, most of the tires of the trucks were buried in the soil, exposed to wind and rain, and no one cared about them.

During the rectification movement, workers put up many big-character posters about this matter. Some "voiced grievances for the cars"; some questioned the depot director for always talking about diligence and thrift in running the enterprise, but himself wasting state property.

Three days after the big-character posters were put up, the rectification leading group assigned a technical inspection team to inspect and found that the chassis of one car was solid and could run with some parts. The engines and chassis of the other two trucks could be disassembled for parts worth more than 5,000 yuan. Upon hearing this news, the workers automatically helped to disassemble the parts in the depot. Now, eighteen tires and a variable reducer have been assembled on other newly repaired vehicles.

Recently, led by the depot director and captains, the workers of the depot also picked up many parts abandoned in the depot, saving the country more than 3,000 yuan in wealth.

Installed a Large Grinding Wheel

"We raised the suggestion for more than a year. This time, the large grinding wheel was installed, and it is as good as new to use, which saves money and solves the problem."

This is something that the workers of the wheel workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have been frequently mentioning recently.

Originally, their leader's area only had a small grinding wheel, but they were grinding large machine tool cutters. Using a small grinding wheel to grind large cutters was not only unproductive but also irregular. The suggestion to install a large grinding wheel had been raised long ago. The workshop also made the suggestion to the equipment section, and the equipment section said that this was basic construction and would have to wait until a plan was drawn up. The matter was shelved. Later, at the workshop's employee meeting, this issue was raised again. Although the leaders had also found an old grinding wheel frame in the old materials warehouse, it was soon abandoned.

It was not until this rectification that worker Liu Kede raised this suggestion again, and the leaders assigned the maintenance team to assemble the grinding wheel using waste materials. With a large grinding wheel, the ground cutters are not only regular but also twice as fast as the small grinding wheel, and the quality of work is also improved compared to before. The workers said: If it weren't for the rectification, who knows when this grinding wheel would have been installed!

    在边整边改的高潮中
    新华社记者　周邵雷
    在首都四十个国营厂矿企业的整风运动中，改进工作的喜讯一个接着一个地传来。职工们异口同声地说：这次整风真解决问题！最近记者在采访中就发现许多生动事例。
    “黑工具”合法了
    第一机床厂的工人为了工具问题已经“头痛”了好几年了。工厂技术科设计的许多专用工具，看起来既精致又漂亮，但是拿到机床上一试，常常不好用。加工第二车间的钻床工人张茂需要一个钻模工具，当他看到技术科设计的工具时，立时就火了：“使这个工具怎么能达到定额？”原来这个工具使用起来非常麻烦，增加了很多辅助工时，一次只能作两个零件。他自己用铁板做的简单工具一次能做五个，技术科硬让他使用发下的工具，他怎能不着急呢？
    原来技术科在设计工具时尽搬书本，既不考虑车间生产的具体情况，又不跟使用工具的工人商量。费了很多工料制造出来的工具不合用，只好被扔到废铁堆里去。
    技术科的工具不能使，制度又规定不准工人自己用材料作。工人只好到废料堆去找点材料悄悄地做些工具用。可是技术科知道以后，批评这是“黑工具”，不合法，这真叫工人左右为难，哭笑不得。
    在整风运动中，工人又把这个老问题提出来了。技术科这次主动召开了工人座谈会，虚心听取意见，把过去的所谓“黑工具”列出目录，作为以后设计工具的参考，同时决定今后制造工具一定要同车间有关人员商量，车间领导方面认为有必要时，技术科可以发材料让工人自己做。这样一来，“黑工具”合法化了。最近技术科同加工第二车间的工具调整工等工人共同研究，制造了一种车床上用的芯轴，工人拿到这个工具之后非常高兴，都说：用这种工具，我们保证完成任务。
    整开了“方便之门”
    第一汽车附件厂职工的宿舍在工厂的东边，可是行政部门怕管理麻烦，建厂以来，一直规定不准自行车从东门出入，骑车的工人上下班不得不绕好几里路的大弯子，从西门进出厂。天天如此，月月如此。到了冬天，西北风夹着大雪呼呼地迎头刮来，蹬车特别费劲。
    职工虽然对这事提了很多意见，可是领导方面老以为这是小事，没放在心里。整风中工人又提出这个问题，负责这个工作的干部检查说：“过去我们在工作中老是考虑自己的方便，对于大家的方便却考虑太少了。”他们经过讨论，马上改变了自行车的管理办法，取消了禁止自行车出入东门的制度。这一改进，所有骑自行车的人都感到方便多了。老工人王化勋说：“事情虽小，这一改，可省了很多麻烦！”有人补充说：“今后该把走弯路的劲儿使到生产上去了。”
    不花钱的“休息室”
    “领导上给我们解决休息室了！”北京市市内电话局三分局线务员们兴奋地奔走相告这个消息。当天中午休息时间，二十多个线务员自动去打扫刚分配给他们的休息室。
    整风运动以前，这个局的三十个线务员只有一间休息室。每天早晨，电缆班、干线班、查修班等三个小组在室内开碰头会时，声音嘈杂，相互干扰，很难研究问题。到了休息时间，屋内挤得满满的，线务员们从户外安装电线回来，想休息一下也不行。每逢下雨，带着工具的自行车就放在室内，这时线务员们连站脚的地方都难找到。线务员们“需要一间休息室”的意见提了一年多，却没有引起领导上的重视。
    整风刚开始，线务员们就贴出大字报叙述没有休息室的苦恼。这次，郎文玉局长亲自下来了解情况，发现不需花钱，只要将仓库稍加整理，就能腾出一间空房。意见提出不到三天，问题就解决了。
    “报废车”出土
    9月初，在永定门外沙子口车场的西南角，二十多个工人把埋在沙土坑里的三辆卡车拖出来，拆卸了上面的轮胎和零件。
    这三辆卡车，是今年3月底从北京市汽车运输公司马连道车场拖来的。当时，车场场长不加检查，就认为是“报废车”。五个多月来，卡车的轮胎大半部埋在土内，任凭风吹雨打，无人过问。
    整风运动中，工人们为这事贴出了许多大字报。有的为“汽车喊冤”；有的质问场长光说勤俭办企业，自己却浪费国家财产。
    大字报贴出以后第三天，整风领导小组委派技术检查组去检查，发现有一辆车的底盘牢固，配上一些零件，就能行驶。另外两辆卡车的发动机、底盘等零件拆下来，价值五千多元。工人们听到这个消息，就自动地帮助场内拆卸零件。现在，十八个轮胎和一个变缩器已经装配在其他新修成的车辆上。
    最近，车场工人在场长和队长们带领下，还检拾了遗弃在场内的许多零件，为国家节约了三千多元财富。
    安上了大砂轮
    “提了一年多的意见，这回可把大砂轮安上了，使起来跟新的一样，既省钱又解决问题。”
    这是长辛店机车车辆修理工厂车轮车间工人最近经常提到的一件事。
    原来他们所在的领工区只有一个小砂轮，磨的却都是大车床大刀具。用小砂轮磨大刀具，一来不出活，二来也不规矩。要求安个大砂轮的意见，早就提过了，车间也跟设备科提过，设备科说这是基本建设，要等订出计划再说。事情就搁下了。后来车间开职工大会，这个问题又提出来，领导上虽然也曾到旧料库里找出了一台旧砂轮架子，可是不久又扔下了。
    直到这次整风，工人刘克德再一次提出这个意见，领导上才指派维修组利用废料把这台砂轮机组装起来。有了大砂轮，磨出刀来不但规矩，而且比小砂轮快上一倍，做活质量也比从前提高了。工人们说：要不是整风，这台砂轮还不知什么时候能安上呢！
