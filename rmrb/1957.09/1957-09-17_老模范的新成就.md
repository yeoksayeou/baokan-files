The agricultural cooperatives led by national model agricultural workers Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli, Guo Yu'en, Shen Jilan, and Wu Houli have created many new achievements in this year's movement to strive for a bumper harvest. Recently, this reporter conducted interviews regarding this.

The Jinxing Cooperative: 97% of Members Can Increase Income

In early September, in the terraced fields on both sides of the Han River in Longzhen, Pingshun County, in the Taihang Mountains, the heavy ears of grain were nearly a foot long, and the stout-stalked, large-eared corn had already grown to seven or eight feet high. This is the crop of the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. Cooperative director Li Shunda and the cooperative members have overcome the difficulties left over from last year's disaster and are about to realize this year's increased production plan. According to the results of the most recent field assessment, the average estimated yield of the cooperative's more than 1,600 mu of autumn grain crops is more than 450 jin per mu. This year's production will not only be higher than last year's but may also exceed the increased production target proposed in 1956 to farmers nationwide. In leading the cooperative members to strive for this year's bumper harvest, Li Shunda took the lead in participating in labor, "leading production with production," and focused on helping backward teams and groups improve their work. The cooperative repaired more than 4,000 zhang of field dikes that were destroyed by floods last year. This year, they also paid attention to operations in remote and low-yield areas and promoted improved varieties and advanced technologies in accordance with local conditions. In order to save funds and reduce loans from the state, the cooperative adopted various methods. By organizing cooperative members to repair farm tools and weave baskets through mutual aid, they saved more than 3,880 yuan in expenses.

The number of pigs raised by this cooperative has more than doubled since its establishment. According to the most recent statistics, in addition to selling nearly 300 piglets and fat pigs, the cooperative has 450 pigs in stock, with an average of nearly two pigs per household. Currently, the cooperative has more than 30 sows awaiting delivery, and the number of piglets bred this year will greatly exceed the plan. Cooperative members have reported that a miracle has occurred in Xigou's pig raising this year. The deputy director leading the cooperative members in pig raising is Shen Jilan (female). She told reporters that the cooperative is now digging wild vegetables and collecting tree leaves to prepare winter feed reserves. At the same time, they have also signed inspection and treatment contracts with the county veterinary station to strengthen pigpen management and strive to complete the pig breeding plan.

Due to the cooperative's production development, coupled with careful calculation and frugality in running the cooperative, according to this year's pre-distribution plan, 97% of the members of the Jinxing Cooperative can increase their income.

The Guoguang Cooperative Achieves Victory in Boll Shedding Control Experiment

Qu Yaoli, the model cotton grower who leads the Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyu County, has made a major improvement in cotton planting technology this year. Their experiment in controlling boll shedding has achieved great results. In the past, boll shedding in general cotton fields was generally around 60%, but this year, the boll shedding in the cooperative's high-yield experimental field has been reduced to 46%. In this way, the boll setting rate in the high-yield cotton fields will greatly exceed that of previous years.

Since August, the cooperative has launched a campaign to protect buds and bolls and strive for each cotton seedling to produce one more cotton boll, striving to increase the average yield of seed cotton by more than 15 jin per mu in the cooperative's cotton fields.

This year, under the condition of drought, the Guoguang Cooperative adopted methods such as light watering, frequent watering, timely watering, alternating furrow watering, and mid-tillage to cut off capillary roots, which controlled the excessive growth of cotton seedlings and the phenomenon of large-scale boll shedding. It is estimated that more than 60 mu of high-yield cotton fields can produce 500 jin of seed cotton per mu, of which 2.5 mu can produce an average of 1,065 jin per mu. Thanks to careful early-stage processing, continuous fighting against pests seven times, timely topdressing, pruning, and bud removal, the cooperative's more than 10,000 mu of cotton fields are estimated to produce more than 190 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year.

The "May 1st" Cooperative Strives for a Bumper Harvest

After suffering from natural disasters last year, the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Chuandi Township, Pingshun County, brought great difficulties to this year's production. Guo Yu'en was not intimidated by the difficulties. He led the cooperative members to fight tenaciously with the difficulties for several months and finally won the upcoming harvest. According to the cooperative's estimated yield, the average yield of autumn fields per mu will be more than 450 jin, exceeding the original plan by 13 jin. This year, the per-mu yield will increase by 77 jin compared to last year, and the total income will also exceed last year's by more than one-third.

On the basis of a promising harvest, the cooperative members are now making persistent efforts to strive for a greater harvest. The cooperative launched a campaign to contribute ideas and suggestions, giving full play to the wisdom of the cooperative members, and formulated post-management measures and harvesting plans for autumn fields. The cooperative also organized cooperative members to combat mountain hazards, remove diseased plants from the fields, and carry out a series of autumn protection activities such as fire prevention, theft prevention, and preventing sabotage, while also preparing for the autumn harvest.

The Red Star Cooperative: Four Joys Come Together

The Yangjingdi Village in Pingshun County, known as the "Pear Orchard on the Taihang Mountains," presents a scene of joy and busyness. Large quantities of fruit are continuously transported from here to towns and cities. The Red Star Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative has once again won a bumper harvest this year. On the hillside, clusters of trees are full of abundant pears, red and green interwoven.

Cooperative director Wu Houli told reporters that in order to realize the new plan of "four joys" in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, this year they first pruned and processed more than 90 mu of pear orchards, and more than 40 mu of pear orchards were generally irrigated once. Based on the lessons learned from previous years' pest infestations, preventive measures were taken with pesticides. In terms of animal husbandry, sheep breeding has reached the original plan of increasing by 25%, and 150 improved fine-wool sheep have been added. In terms of sideline occupations, income has also increased after finding various production avenues. The three items of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations have now blossomed and bear fruit. In the struggle to resist drought and protect seedlings, the cooperative members built more than 100 small canals and utilized more than 100 dry wells, carrying water to irrigate more than 300 mu of seedlings, ensuring the normal growth of most crops. Recently, the cooperative members have strengthened the late-stage processing of autumn crops, using vacant small plots of land to plant melons and vegetables, and striving to realize the "joy" of agriculture from multiple aspects.

　　老模范的新成就
　　新华社记者　郭洁
    全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达、曲耀离、郭玉恩、申纪兰、武侯梨所在的合作社，今年在争取大丰收运动中又创造了许多新的成就。最近记者就这方面进行了访问。
　　金星社97％社员可增加收入
    9月初，太行山区平顺县龙镇旱河两侧起伏的梯田里，沉甸甸的谷穗有的近一尺长，秆粗穗大的玉米已经长到七、八尺高。这是金星农林牧生产合作社的庄稼。社主任李顺达和社员们克服了去年灾后生产上遗留下来的困难，今年增产的计划就要实现了。据最近一次田间评比结果，全社一千六百多亩大秋粮食作物，平均每亩估产四百五十多斤，今年不仅比去年增产，还可以超过1956年向全国农民倡议竞赛的增产指标。李顺达在领导社员争取今年丰收中，带头参加劳动，以“生产领导生产”，着重帮助落后的队、组改进工作。全社修整去年被洪水冲毁的地堰四千多丈；今年还注意了远地、低产地的操作，并且因地制宜推广了良种和先进技术。为了节省资金，减少向国家贷款，社里采取了各种办法，仅组织社员用变工的办法修打农具、割条编篓，就节省了三千八百八十多元的支出。
    这个社养猪头数已经比建社时增加了一倍。据最近一次统计，全社除出卖了近三百头小猪和肥猪外，存栏猪已达到四百五十头，平均每户养猪近两头。目前社里又有三十多个母猪待产，今年繁殖猪仔将大大超过计划。社员们反映：今年西沟在养猪方面出现了奇迹。领导社员养猪的是副主任申纪兰（女）。她告诉记者说：现在社里正在挖野菜、打树叶，做储备过冬饲料。同时，他们还和县兽医站订立检查治疗合同，加强了猪圈管理，力争完成猪的繁殖计划。
    由于社里生产发展，加上处处精打细算勤俭办社，根据今年的预分方案，金星社97％的社员都可以增加收入。
    国光社控制落铃试验告捷
    植棉模范曲耀离领导的解虞县国光农业社，今年在植棉技术上有了一个重大的改进。他们进行的控制落铃的试验已经收到很大成效。以往一般棉田落铃普遍在60％左右，今年这个社的丰产试验地的落铃已经减少到46％。这样，丰产地棉田的结桃率将大大超过往年。
    8月以来，这个社又开展了保蕾保铃、争取每株棉苗多结一个棉桃的运动，力争全社棉田每亩平均再增产籽棉十五斤。
    国光社今年在气候干旱的情况下，采用轻浇、勤浇、及时浇、隔沟浇和中耕断切毛根等办法，控制了棉苗狂长和大量落铃的现象。六十多亩高产棉田预计每亩可产籽棉五百斤，其中有两亩半平均每亩可产到一千零六十五斤。全社一万多亩棉田由于前期加工仔细，连续向虫害斗争七次，按时追肥、整枝、剥芽，估计每亩可产到一百九十多斤，比去年增产40％多。
    “五一”社力争大丰收
    平顺县川底乡“五一”农业社去年遭受自然灾害后，给今年生产带来很大困难。郭玉恩并没有给困难吓倒，他领导社员顽强地和困难斗争了几个月，终于赢得了即将到来的丰收。据社里估产，全社平均每亩秋田可产粮四百五十多斤，超过原订计划十三斤。今年每亩单位面积产量将比去年提高七十七斤，总收入也将超过去年三分之一多。
    在丰收可望的基础上，目前社员们正在再接再厉，争取更大丰收。社里开展献计献策活动，发挥社员智慧，制定了秋田后期管理措施和收打计划。社里还组织社员打山害，拔除田禾病株以及开展防火、防盗、防止破坏等一系列的护秋活动，同时做好秋收准备工作。
    红星社四喜齐来
    被称为“太行山上梨园”的平顺县羊井底村，呈现出一片欢乐繁忙景象。大批水果从这里源源运往城镇。红星农林牧生产合作社今年又赢得大丰收。山坡上一丛丛树群，丰硕的梨果累累满枝，红绿交加。
    社主任武侯梨告诉记者，他们为了实现农林牧副业“四喜”的新打算，今年首先在九十多亩梨果园里进行了修枝、加工，有四十多亩梨园普遍用水浇过一次，并且根据往年发生虫害的教训，进行了药剂防治。畜牧业方面，羊的繁殖已经达到原订增加25％的计划，并增加了一百五十只改良品种细毛羊。副业方面，经过找寻多种生产门路后，收入也有了增加。林、牧、副业这三项，现在已经开花结果了。社员们在抗旱保苗斗争中兴修了一百多条小水渠和利用了一百多眼旱井，担水浇苗三百多亩，保证了大部分作物的正常生长。最近，社员们又加强大秋作物后期加工，利用空闲小块土地种植瓜菜，从多方面争取实现农业这一“喜”。
