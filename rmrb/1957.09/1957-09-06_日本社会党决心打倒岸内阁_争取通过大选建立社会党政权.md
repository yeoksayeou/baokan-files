Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th dispatch: The fourteen leading cadres of the Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting today and decided that the Socialist Party's basic attitude towards the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is: to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

The Kyodo News Agency said, "This decision by the Socialist Party is a step forward from its previous ambiguous policy of ‘confrontation’ with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. This decision shows that the Socialist Party is determined to take action based on the principle of absolutely no compromise with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet."

At the meeting, attended by leading cadres such as Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo and Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō, the Socialist Party also decided that in order to unite with labor unions, agricultural associations, and other mass organizations to carry out the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, a large-scale national movement must be launched, and through general elections, efforts must be made to establish a Socialist government. The specific activities decided upon at the meeting were: to launch struggles inside and outside the Diet to defend livelihoods, rights, and democracy, and to launch struggles for peace and independence, in order to prompt the Kishi Nobusuke government to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold general elections. At the same time, starting in mid-September, national rallies to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet will be held in nine regions across the country.

    日本社会党决心打倒岸内阁
    争取通过大选建立社会党政权
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本社会党的十四位领导干部今天举行会议，决定社会党对岸信介内阁的基本态度是：打倒岸信介内阁。
    共同社说，“社会党的这一决定比它以往提出的同岸信介内阁
  ‘对抗’的暧昧的方针前进了一步。这个决定表明社会党决心根据绝对不同岸信介内阁妥协的方针采取行动”。
    在有委员长铃木茂三郎和书记长浅沼稻次郎等领导干部参加的会议上，社会党还决定，为了同工会、农会和其他群众团体团结一致，进行打倒岸信介内阁的斗争，要展开大规模的国民运动，通过大选，争取建立社会党政权。会议决定采取的具体活动是：在国会内外展开保卫生活、权利与民主的斗争，展开争取和平与独立的斗争，以便促使岸信介政府解散众议院，举行大选。同时，要从9月中旬起在全国九个地区分别举行打倒岸信介内阁的国民大会。
