Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The "small family" right-wing group led by Wu Zuguang has been fully and thoroughly exposed and criticized in four consecutive conferences held by the Beijing drama and film circles from the 6th to the 13th, and is now completely defeated.

The "small family" is a young "team" within Wu Zuguang's right-wing group, secretly organized in 1951. It was exposed during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign, but it revived after the campaign.

This small group has a strict organization and division of labor, as well as a set of family rules and slang. They usually address each other as brothers, and only call each other "comrade" when mistakes are made.

This right-wing clique brought together a group of self-proclaimed "child prodigies," "talents," and literary youth dissatisfied with reality, distributed in drama, film, literature, art, and publishing. They have a strict organization and division of labor. Wu Zuguang is the "patriarch," sitting high in command and issuing orders. Du Gao (editor of the Drama Publishing House) is revered as the "political commissar," Wang Ming (editor of the "Script" monthly magazine) is in charge of internal affairs, and Tian Zhuang (editor of Beijing Film Studio), Tao Ye (cadre of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Liaison), etc., are in charge of foreign affairs.

The "small family" has a set of family rules and slang. Their members must have their set of "genius" and "political standards," such as dissatisfaction with the Party, and must be reviewed and approved. Whenever a new family member is approved, the whole family holds a banquet and toasts "for the common cause of the family." The "small family" also stipulates that everyone must report to each other and provide opinions to each other, and must intervene and give tasks when necessary. The "small family" also has a set of common slang. They don't call each other by their real names, but call each other brothers or nicknames. Those who violate the "family rules" are given admonishments for minor offenses and expelled for serious offenses. There is also a kind of punishment for those who have committed so-called "mistakes," that is, to stop calling them brothers or by their real names, but to call them "comrade," or satirically say: "Comrade, you have really made progress!" Tao Ye also said at the conference when confessing the problems of the "small family" that he had once violated the "family rules," and Du Gao, Wang Ming and others satirized him and said: "Comrade Tao Ye, you have really made progress!"

This small group completely inherited the mantle of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and cooperated with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in combat.

This "small family" completely inherited the mantle of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. And has always maintained contact with Lu Ling, a key member of Hu Feng. Before the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique often instructed the main members of the "small family" through Lu Ling to cooperate in combat on some major events. For example, at the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Lu Ling summoned Du Gao and Wang Ming to discuss the list of representatives, and was indignant that Hu Feng members A Long, Lü Yuan, Lü Ying and others failed to be representatives. Before Hu Feng's 300,000-word statement was published, Du Gao saw the printed draft from Lu Ling. The members of the "small family" also inherited Hu Feng's reactionary literary and artistic ideas in literature and art, denied the guiding role of the world outlook on creation methods, emphasized the individual's subjective fighting spirit, and regarded Lu Ling as a "teacher," and still admire and praise Lu Ling's works. During this "blooming and contending" period, Wu Zuguang, Du Gao and others tried every means to defend Hu Feng and Lu Ling's counter-revolutionary activities. Du Gao and others spread rumors everywhere and created "injustices."

The "small family" often fabricated and spread political rumors, slandering and attacking the leadership of the Communist Party. According to the confessions of the members of the "small family" alone, nearly a hundred rumors were spread before and after the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign. This group of insane guys even said arrogantly: "In another ten years, it should be us sitting on the presidium of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles."

In the early stage of the rectification movement, Wu Zuguang commanded this small group to attack the Party in a collective manner.

After the rectification began, they took a collective approach to attack the Communist Party. Wu Zuguang not only sat in command of the battle, but also personally came out to release poisonous arrows at the symposiums of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, openly clamoring that "the Communist Party should stop leading artistic work as soon as possible." Wang Shaoyan, Du Gao, Wang Ming, Tian Zhuang, Tao Ye, etc. all cooperated with Wu Zuguang's speech and action, and jointly planned to write the one-act play "The Wall" and the essays "Empty Writer" and "Behind the Scenes of Chekhov's Tragedy," maliciously attacking the Party's leading comrades in the literary and art departments. Wang Shaoyan, Wang Ming and others spoke at the symposium held by the "Script" monthly magazine to attack the leaders of the Drama Association, which were all discussed with Wu Zuguang in advance, and reported afterwards. They also had to go through Wu Zuguang's modification and review when writing big-character posters. At that time, Wu Zuguang openly slandered the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign as "evil even in the era of autocracy," demanding "rehabilitation," and instigated members of their small group who had been investigated in the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign to "seek redress for grievances and express suffering." Secret meetings were held to plan the reversal of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign.

At the four conferences successively held in Beijing's drama and film circles, more than 20 people spoke. Chen Kehan, Yang Hansheng, Chen Yi, Hu Xiaofeng, Zhao Xun, Lan Guang, etc. systematically and comprehensively exposed and criticized the reactionary organization of the "small family" and its criminal activities. Some members of the "small family" came forward to expose the unspeakable activities within the "family." Wu Zuguang bowed his head and confessed his guilt in the face of ironclad facts. He said: "I have no objections to the speeches at the conference. Only by thoroughly confessing my crimes."

　　“小家族”干着大阴谋
　　吴祖光反动小集团彻底败露
    据新华社15日讯  吴祖光统帅的“小家族”右派集团，在北京戏剧电影界6日至13日连续举行的四次大会上，被全面而彻底地揭发和批判后，现已全部败露。
    “小家族”是吴祖光右派集团中一支青年“队伍”，是在1951年暗中组织起来的，在肃反运动中已被揭穿，而肃反后又死灰复燃。
    这个小集团有严密的组织和分工，又有一套家规和黑话。平时称兄道弟，犯了错误才叫“同志”。
    这个右派小集团纠合一伙自称“神童”“才子”和不满现实的文艺青年，分布在戏剧、电影、文学、美术和出版等方面。他们有着严密的组织和分工。吴祖光为“家长”，高踞帅位发号施令。杜高（戏剧出版社编辑）被尊为“政委”，汪明（“剧本”月刊编辑）主持内政，田庄（北影编辑）、陶冶（对外文化联络局干部）等管外交。
    “小家族”内有一套家规和黑话。他们吸收成员要具有他们一套“天才”和“政治标准”，如对党不满等，还得经过审查批准。每当批准吸收新族员时，全家族要举行宴会，并在酒宴席上为“家族共同事业干杯”。“小家族”又规定每人要互相汇报互相提供意见，必要时得加以干涉和给予任务。“小家族”内部还有一套通用的黑话，互相间不称现名，只称哥道弟或叫绰号或小名。违反“家规”的，轻者训诫，重者开除。对犯有所谓“过失”者还有一种处分，就是停止兄弟和本名之称而叫他“同志”，或讽刺说：“同志，你真进步！”陶冶最近在大会上交代“小家族”的问题时也说，他有一次曾触犯了“家规”，杜高、汪明等人就讽刺说：“陶冶同志，你真进步！”
    这个小集团完全继承了胡风反革命集团的衣钵，并曾和胡风反革命集团配合作战。
    这个“小家族”完全继承了胡风反革命集团的衣钵。而且始终和胡风骨干分子路翎建立着联系。在肃反运动前，胡风反革命集团常通过路翎在一些重大事件上指使“小家族”首要分子配合作战。例如在第二次全国文代大会上，路翎曾召集杜高、汪明商讨代表名单，曾为胡风分子阿垅、绿原、吕荧等未能当代表而愤愤不平。胡风的三十万言书未公布前，杜高便从路翎那里看到了打印稿，“小家族”成员在文艺上也是继承了胡风的反动文艺思想，否认世界观对创作方法的指导作用，强调个人的主观战斗精神，并以路翎为“师表”，至今还对路翎的作品崇拜赞扬。在这次“鸣放”期间，吴祖光、杜高等想尽方法为胡风、路翎的反革命活动辩护。杜高等到处散布流言蜚语，制造“冤情”。
    “小家族”经常制造传播政治性的流言蜚语，诬蔑和打击共产党的领导。仅据“小家族”成员的交代，在肃反前后散布的流言蜚语有近百条。这批丧心病狂的家伙，还曾狂妄地说：“再过十年，坐在全国文联主席台上的就该是我们这些人了。”
    整风初期吴祖光指挥这个小集团采取集体方式向党进攻。
    整风开始后，他们采取集体的方式向共产党进攻。吴祖光不仅坐镇指挥战斗，还亲自出马在全国文联、文化部出版事业管理局的座谈会上大放毒箭，公开叫嚣要“共产党趁早别领导艺术工作”。王少燕、杜高、汪明、田庄、陶冶等都配合吴祖光的发言行动起来，共同策划写出独幕剧“墙”和小品文“空头作家”、“契诃夫悲剧的幕后”等，恶意地攻击文艺部门党的领导同志。王少燕、汪明等在“剧本”月刊社召开的座谈会上发言向剧协领导进攻，都事先与吴祖光商量过，事后又作了汇报。他们写大字报也得经吴祖光修改审查。当时，吴祖光公开诬蔑肃反运动“即使在专制时代也都是罪恶的”，要求“平反”，并唆使在肃反运动中被审查过的他们小集团成员“有冤诉冤，有苦诉苦”。举行秘密集会，策划肃反的翻案问题。
    在北京戏剧电影界陆续召开的四次大会上，有二十多人发言。陈克寒、阳翰笙、陈沂、胡晓风、赵寻、蓝光等系统而全面地揭发和批判了“小家族”的反动组织及其罪恶活动。“小家族”中的一部分成员站出来揭发“家族”内不可告人的勾当。吴祖光在铁的事实面前表示低头认罪。他说：“我对大会上的发言提不出反对的意见。只有彻底交代我的罪行。”
