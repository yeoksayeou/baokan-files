    Father and Son's Evening Chat
    Li Zhensheng
    In mid-July, I went home to see my dad. After dinner, my dad and I chatted aimlessly. My dad told me about the changes in the village over the past few years, the production situation of the cooperative, who had recently gotten married in the village, and so on. Suddenly, my dad said, "The new society is good..." After a moment of silence, he said, "But some people say that we sell too much grain to the state and it's not enough to eat." I asked, "How much grain is left per person on average?" My dad said, "Our village had a disaster last year. After selling surplus grain, paying public grain, livestock feed, etc., each person was left with 360 jin; but it's not uniform, some have more." I said, "So, that's one jin or more of grain per person per day." My dad looked at me and said, "That's right." At that moment, I thought to myself, "The cadres in our county government also have one jin of grain per person per day, and they eat very well, with a little surplus every month." So I asked my dad incredulously, "Can't be, right? We also have one jin of grain per person per day, and we eat quite well." My dad said, "You have a lot of people, so you can distribute it, and you have more refined grains, and you're doing sedentary work, so you don't eat much. I don't think we'll have enough grain this year." Hearing this, I also began to worry about the family's grain problem and fell into a speechless situation.

    In the lamplight, my dad lowered his head, and I saw the crescent-shaped scar on his head, bald and without hair. I quickly remembered the story my grandmother often told me when I was little about the scar on my dad's head: When my dad was thirteen years old, because the family was poor and had nothing to eat, my dad climbed a tree to pick locust leaves to eat, and accidentally fell from the tree, hitting his head and losing a piece of skin, exposing the bone, and knocking out two pairs of teeth. Later, this crescent-shaped scar was left on his head. I remember clearly that my grandmother always said with tears in her eyes when she talked about this incident, "It almost cost your dad his life!"...

    "Dad! How much grain did our family harvest each year before liberation? Was it enough to eat back then?" My dad looked at me in surprise and said, "Ah, how can you even mention that society! Before liberation, our family of seven cultivated ten acres of broken land. Which year didn't we have to pay grain for land rent, land taxes, and head taxes, and after deducting all kinds of donations, we could only have one dan (160 jin) of grain per person in a good year. In a bad year, we might not even have enough chaff and vegetable leaves to fill our stomachs." My dad stopped talking here and smoked. I asked again, "Then how did you live back then?" My dad looked at me again and said, "You should probably still remember, right? What kind of food and water did our family eat before liberation? Every one of the three hundred and sixty days of the year did we not eat rice mixed with chaff and bean leaves?" At this time, my dad lowered his head again to just smoke, and didn't say anything more. Obviously, my dad was trying his best to avoid talking about the suffering of the old society.

    Even though my dad didn't want to talk about the suffering of the old society anymore, the scene of the painful life in the old society had been driven into my mind and couldn't be dispelled. In the year of liberation, I was already fifteen years old and remembered everything clearly. My grandmother lived to be seventy-seven years old and had never seen a mattress or worn a new piece of clothing. My mother married at the age of fifteen and died of illness at the age of forty-five, only covered with a quilt. By the time she died, that quilt was patched so many times that it was like a stiff tile. We ate two kinds of food every day: cornmeal and dry food with less chaff were only allowed for my dad and me to eat. My mother, grandmother, and sisters, although the youngest had just learned to eat and the oldest was seventy years old, could only eat a thin soup of chaff and noodles and cornbread that only had vegetable leaves and no flour for every meal of the day. Because my grandmother was old, it was difficult for her to defecate after eating those things, so she drank sesame oil every two or three days (later I learned that it was to help with bowel movements). What I can't forget the most is the situation when my mother was dying. My mother was very ill and wanted to eat steamed buns, but there wasn't even a trace of white flour in the house, and there was no money to buy it, so she didn't get to eat it at the time. Two days later, just after lunch, my sisters went out to play. My mother was already approaching the border of death, but she still asked my dad to give her some steamed buns to eat. My dad hardened his face and went to a distant uncle's house and said he wanted to borrow two steamed buns (actually to ask for them) to treat my mother's illness, and finally got them. But when he rushed back, my mother only ate one bite, and the second bite was difficult to swallow. I was in front of her, my dad was sitting behind her head, she handed a whole steamed bun to my dad, and stuffed the broken steamed bun into my hand and said, "Bao'er! Let our child eat it..." My mother didn't say anything more, and her deep eye sockets were already filled with tears. I cried out loud. My dad's tears rolled down from the sides of his nose and dripped on my mom's hands. We cried together.

    When I thought back to this, I couldn't help but shed tears again. My dad had already seen it, and I couldn't make any other explanation, so I had to say to my dad, "Dad! Do you still remember the time when my mom ate steamed buns when she was dying?" My dad lowered his head again. I didn't know if he was crying, I only heard my dad blow his nose.

    "Let's talk about now, thinking about the past won't make it any better." I changed the topic again. I didn't want the painful old events to torment our hearts. My dad started smoking another pipe of tobacco again. In the lamplight, I could still see the remaining tears shining on his eyelashes, but his face became kind and joyful.

    "The situation now is truly the blessing that Chairman Mao gave us." My dad pointed to a stack of colorful bedding and the blankets covering my sleeping sisters on the kang and said, "Your grandmother and mother never saw these things when they were alive, alas! They died too early." My dad fell into deep thought again.

    "Dad! Don't think about the past anymore, let's discuss whether we have enough grain this year." My dad smiled and said, "To be honest, before liberation we ate three parts grain and seven parts chaff and vegetables. Now we eat pure yellow grain. Of course, after your grandmother and mother passed away, relying on your sisters to cook, they won't save anything. They eat high-quality dry rice in the spring, summer, autumn, winter, morning, and night. Needless to say, if we eat like we did before liberation, even if we eat a little chaff and vegetables like we did when we just liberated (because the production level was not high and not much grain was harvested), we would still have grain to spare." My dad pointed to the seven buckets of vegetable urns at the door and said, "When your grandmother was alive, which year didn't she eat two urns of bean leaves? We pickled half an urn last autumn, and there's still a little less than half an urn left now, but we're just eating it as a rare treat, and we haven't eaten chaff for a long time." I asked impatiently, "Dad! Do you think we have enough grain this year?" He moved closer to me and said with a smile, "We can't finish it."

    My dad looked at the brand new bleached summer clothes I was wearing, and pinched the old navy blue pants I was wearing on his legs and said, "You dislike this thing! We couldn't even wear it for the New Year before. In a word, people these days are not thrifty!" I was satisfied with my dad's criticism. Later, I told my dad about how the rightists wanted to destroy our socialism, and how we fought back against the rightists. After listening, my dad stood up and said fiercely, "Painfully beat those guys, we can't let them destroy our good times." It was already past midnight, and my dad and I slept on the same kang. I slept very sweetly that night, and slept soundly until dawn. The next morning, my dad gave me white flour pancakes. When I left, my dad sent me to the outside of the village and repeatedly urged me: "When you go back to the county, do your work well and severely crack down on the rightists. Don't worry about the family, everything is fine at home."

    父子一夕谈
    李振生
    7月中旬我回家看爹。吃过晚饭后，我和爹无边际地谈着。爹给我介绍村上几年来的变化，合作社的生产情况，村上新近谁们又结了婚等等。忽然爹谈到：“新社会就是好……”稍停了片刻说：“可是有人说就是卖给国家粮食多了，不大够吃。”我就问：“每口人平均留粮多少？”爹说：“咱村年时（去年）灾了，除了卖余粮、交公粮、牲口料什么的，每一口人还留下三百六十斤；不过不一，有的还多。”我说：“那末，一口人一天一斤或一斤多粮食了。”爹看看我说：“可不。”这时候我心里头盘算着：“我们县机关干部每人每天也是一斤粮食，还吃的很好，月月有少许的节余。”因此我不相信地问爹：“不能吧？我们也是一人一天一斤粮，吃得挺好嘛。”爹说：“你们人多，能匀出来了，细粮又多，还是坐着的活，吃不多。我看咱今年的粮就不怎么够吃。”我听了也开始为家里的粮食问题担心了，一时陷于无话可说的场面。
    在灯光下，爹一低头，我看见他头上那片月牙形的伤痕，光光的没有头发。我很快就想起了我祖母在我小时候常对我说的关于爹头上这片伤痕的故事：那是我爹在十三岁上，因为家穷没吃的，爹上树揪槐叶吃，不小心从树上跌下来，碰的头上掉了一片皮，露着骨头，还碰掉两对牙。后来，头上留下了这一片月牙形的疤痕。我记得清楚，祖母说起这回事来总是眼夹着泪说：“险些要了你爹的命！”……
    “爹！你说解放前咱家每年打多少粮食？那时候够不够吃？”爹惊异地看了我一眼说：“唉，那社会还能提！解放前咱家七口人，种着十来亩破地，哪一年不是除了出租米以外，捐地亩税、人口税也是出粮，除刨一切捐项以后，好年成一人能有一石（160斤）粮食，年成一歪就说不定糠菜也吃不饱肚。”爹说到这里停下来吸烟。我又问：“那么那时候怎么过活哩？”爹又看了我一眼说：“大概你还该记得吧？解放前咱家吃的是什么食水？齐年三百六十天哪一吨饭不见糠和豆叶菜？”这时候我爹又低下头去光吸烟，再不往下说了。显然我爹是竭力想避开谈旧社会的苦处的。
    尽管爹不愿再谈论旧社会的苦难，但是旧社会痛苦生活的情景已在我脑子里驱它不散。在解放的那年，我已经是十五岁了，什么都记得清楚。我祖母活了七十七岁没见过褥子，没穿过一件新衣服，我母亲十五岁上结婚到四十五岁上病死只盖了一条棉被，到她死的时候那条被子千补万纳的像一块僵硬的瓦片。我们每天吃两样饭：玉茭面和糠少的干粮只许我和爹吃，母亲、祖母和妹妹们，虽然她们小的刚会吃饭，老的七十高寿，但每日三餐只能吃到糠面糊汤汤和光见菜叶不见面的窝窝头。因为我祖母上年纪了，吃那些东西大便不下去，三天两头喝大麻油（后来我才知道是利大便的）。最使我不能忘记的是我妈临死的情形。我妈病得很厉害了，想吃馒头，可是家里没一点白面味，买又没钱，当时没有吃到。隔了两天，刚吃过中午饭，妹妹们出去玩了，妈妈已经接近了死亡的边境，她还是要求爹给她点馒头吃，爹硬着脸皮到我一个远房伯伯家说是借两个馒头（实际是要）给我妈治病，好容易才要到。可是赶拿回来时妈妈只吃了一口，第二口好不容易才咽下去。我在她跟前，爹坐在她脑后，她把一个整馒头递给爹，把破馒头塞到我手里说：“宝儿！俺孩吃了吧……”妈妈再没有讲出声来，在她那深深的眼窝里已经充满了泪水。我失声大哭了。爹的眼泪从鼻子两侧滚下来滴在妈的手上。我们哭成了一团。
    我回想到这里，情不由己的又淌出了眼泪，爹已经看见，我也不能作别的解释，只好向爹说：“爹！你还记得我妈临死的时候吃馒头的事吗？”爹又低下头去。我不知道他掉泪没有，只听得爹捏了一把水鼻涕。
    “还是说现在吧，往事再想也好不了。”还是我又把话题扭转了。我不愿意让痛苦的旧事折磨我们的心。爹又重新吸着了一锅旱烟，在灯光下还可看见他睫毛上闪亮着的余泪，但脸面却变的慈祥喜悦。
    “这时候的光景，那诚然是毛主席老人家给咱的福气。”爹用手指了一下炕上一叠花红柳绿的被褥和正睡着的妹妹们盖的毯子说：“这些东西你奶奶和妈妈活着时哪里见过，唉！她们死得太早了。”我爹又陷入了沉思。
    “爹！别再想过去那些了，咱还是合计合计咱今年粮食到底够不够吃吧。”爹笑了笑说：“说实话，解放前咱吃的是三分粮食七分糠菜，这时候吃的是黄鲜鲜的净粮食。自然，你奶奶和妈妈老家（死）以后，靠你妹妹们做饭也不会节省，春、夏、秋、冬和早晨、黑夜都吃的是上等干饭。不用说照解放前那样吃法，就照刚解放时候那样颠调着多少吃点糠菜（因刚解放后生产水平不高，粮食打的不多），粮食还是有余的。”爹用手指了指门口的七斗菜瓮说：“你奶奶活着的时候，哪一年不吃这么两瓮豆叶菜呢？年时（去年）秋天捣了半瓮，现在还有少半瓮，只是吃个稀罕了，糠也早不吃了。”我性急地问：“爹！你说咱今年的粮食够不够吃呢？”他向我靠近了些笑着说：“吃不完的。”
    爹看看我穿得一身崭新的漂白夏衣，捏了捏他的腿上穿的我那条旧海昌蓝裤子说：“这东西你就嫌不好啦！从前咱家过新年也穿不上的。一句话，这时候的人们是不节省了！”我满意爹的批评。后来我就给爹谈了些关于右派分子们如何想破坏我们的社会主义，我们如何反击右派。爹听了站起来狠狠地说：“痛痛地打那些家伙们，可不能让他们破坏我们的好光景。”天已经是深夜十二点多了，我和爹在一盘炕上睡了觉。这一夜睡得挺甜，一觉睡了个通天亮。第二天早晨爹给我吃了白面烙油饼。临我走时，爹送我到村外，再三叮嘱我：“回县里要好好做工作，狠狠地打击右派。不要惦记家里，家里什么都好得很。”
