Eighteen Days of "Dictatorship"
    Li Chun

    In the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra, there was a group of right-wing elements who, during the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work style, carried out a series of secret activities, overthrew the leadership of the orchestra's Party branch, and established a so-called "representative of public opinion" presidium, completing the action of seizing leadership. The presidium came to power on May 30th and, in the context of the national anti-rightist struggle, announced on June 18th that it had "completed its historical mission" and voluntarily stepped down, implementing an eighteen-day "dictatorship." During this period, the presidium sent a "first ambassador to Beijing" to the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture to negotiate, looking just like a national government.

    How was the trouble in the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra incited? It turned out that Liu Zhengtan, who was studying at the Tianjin Conservatory of Music, suddenly returned to the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra during the Great Blooming and Contending period. He went around the orchestra, igniting and instigating everywhere. Liu Zhengtan introduced the situation of blooming and contending in other places to many people, promoting how lively it was at the Tianjin Conservatory of Music, with big-character posters and open demands for the dean of studies to step down, saying that this was the "real" "democracy" to solve problems. Liu also introduced the experiences of blooming and contending at the Normal University and the Beijing Film Academy, and then incited people, saying, "Our orchestra is still so calm!" "We must make a good effort to solve the problems of the orchestra over so many years in this movement."

    His malicious provocations and instigations did indeed confuse a portion of the masses at the time. Some people who were dissatisfied with the Party gathered around him and began to brew anti-Party actions.

    In this anti-Party clique, there were three right-wing elements within the Party. Fang Zhenxiang, the propaganda committee member of the Party branch, was the most vicious anti-Party conspirator. Fang had always been dissatisfied with the Party and hostile to it. In December of last year, he wrote a letter to the factory director and the Party committee secretary that was extremely reactionary in content, slandering the factory for treating him "like a machine and a beast of burden," even worse than "the enlightened factory owners of the past." During the Great Blooming and Contending period, Fang Zhenxiang engaged in incitement at all meetings inside and outside the Party, maliciously attacking the Party and actively carrying out behind-the-scenes anti-Party planning. Thus, he was embraced by the right-wing elements as the leader of the anti-Party forces and became the chairman of the subsequent presidium. Fang Zhenxiang's methods of opposing the Party were extremely vicious. He did not come forward himself, but called on the masses to come forward, saying, "It is best for the masses to do it, they have power. If Party members make mistakes, it is a political error, but even if you (referring to non-Party members) have problems, they are ideological problems."

    In order to incite the masses and launch an attack on the Party, the right-wing elements first seized the propaganda tools. Lü Xiaoqiu, a key right-wing element, was originally the organization committee member of the Youth League branch, not responsible for the blackboard newspaper work, but he did not consult with any member of the Youth League branch and appointed himself as the "editorial board member" of the blackboard newspaper, through which he released many articles that exaggerated and distorted facts, inciting the masses to attack the Party. On May 25th, the first inflammatory article appeared on the orchestra's blackboard newspaper, entitled "Where is the Future of the Orchestra?" calling on everyone to "unite and fight against bureaucracy," slandering activists as "running dogs" and threatening them to be careful not to "perish together" with the bureaucrats (this article was co-authored by Liu Zhengtan and Zeng Yajie). Cartoons such as "Flattering" were also published successively, making every effort to uglify and slander the leaders and activists.

    The right-wing elements carried out anti-Party secret activities behind the backs of the Party and administrative leaders. They held three secret meetings one after another, planning how to overthrow the leadership of the Party branch and establish a presidium, and made advance arrangements for the candidates for the presidium. According to the steps planned in the secret meetings, they launched a planned battle at the orchestra's plenary meeting on May 30th. At the meeting, they openly opposed the leadership of the blooming and contending leading core group composed of the Party branch and administrative heads, saying that the current leaders could not represent the masses, and that bureaucrats could not lead the opposition to bureaucracy, demanding to replace the leaders and elect a presidium to lead the blooming and contending. The right-wing elements swayed the meeting, and the meeting was disrupted by their planned conspiracy. The masses were deceived, and the twelve-person presidium that they had arranged in advance was thus produced. Thus, their conspiracy to overthrow the leadership of the Party and seize the leadership of the blooming and contending was completely realized.

    The presidium had agencies such as a propaganda group and a special case group, and also proposed a "suppression of counter-revolutionaries" problem group, attempting to examine the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries under the leadership of the Party, reverse verdicts, and openly challenge the Party.

    The Party organization of the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra was completely disintegrated, and some of them became right-wing elements who frantically attacked the Party, or people who followed the right-wing elements. Others, in the face of the right-wing elements' attacks, could not stand up and fight.

    At the first meeting of the presidium on May 31st, the executive chairman of the meeting, Liu Zhengtan, delivered a "declaration" on behalf of the presidium. He began by talking about the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Polish-Hungarian events, and then discussed the mutual transformation of the two types of contradictions, inciting the masses to transform the contradictions among the people into antagonistic contradictions. Finally, he announced on behalf of the presidium: "The presidium is determined to complete the task, and we will never disband unless one problem is solved!"

    After the establishment of the presidium, the right-wing elements became even more blatant in carrying out anti-Party activities. They provoked and expanded the contradictions between the leaders and the masses, encouraged the masses to refuse to accept work assignments, disrupted the orchestra's performance plans and film recording work, and openly called on the masses to make trouble and petition in Beijing. Liu Zhengtan and Lü Xiaoqiu incited the masses at the meeting, saying: The Film Bureau is full of bureaucrats, and it is useless to deal with them, go to the State Council to reason! Go to the Central Government to petition!

    The mass petition to Beijing did not materialize, so the presidium sent an "ambassador" to Beijing to carry out activities, attempting to unite with the right-wing elements of the Beijing Film Academy to fight for the "system problem." Liu Zhengtan, in the capacity of the first "ambassador to Beijing," wrote back three reports to the presidium. The original copies of the first and second reports were burned because they contained unspeakable secrets, and only the modified reports were preserved to deal with the investigation at the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle. In the third report, it said: "Today, I went to the Film Bureau and encountered an unsatisfactory ending," suggesting that the presidium "disclose the current situation to the masses, let the masses express their opinions, and then sort out the masses' opinions (the system plan and rectification), and the entire presidium will coordinate the masses' opinions to come to Beijing to sit down with the Ministry of Culture (sit down and negotiate)." He reported the results of his activities at the New Film Studio: "Some activists at the New Film Studio are very supportive of us and have suggested that our three orchestras unite and take consistent action."

    They wanted to set fire to Beijing, but because the anti-rightist struggle began, Liu felt that the situation was unfavorable, and he rushed back to Changchun.

    Not long after the presidium's activities, the masses began to feel that there was a problem, believing that the presidium was illegal and divorced from the leadership of the Party. Some people even discussed: The presidium is the Hungarian workers' council. At this time, the right-wing elements were still very arrogant and threatened those who criticized them. Later, they realized that the masses' resentment towards them was becoming more and more uncontrollable, so they changed their strategy and prepared to retreat. At the last meeting, they announced the dissolution of the presidium, saying that the presidium had "completed its historical mission," "the masses have been mobilized," and "the resolution of contradictions among the people should be led by the Party committee itself, and there is no need for the presidium to exist anymore." At the same time, they blamed the Party, saying: "With the leadership of the Party, the presidium has power without authority and only plays the role of a megaphone, why shouldn't we disband?"

    This vicious anti-Party clique—the presidium—existed for eighteen days. Their frenzied attack on the Party was repelled, and this anti-Party group disintegrated. Some right-wing elements have already pleaded guilty, and some still adhere to their reactionary stance and confront the Party, but they have no power anymore. Some of the masses who had been deceived by the right-wing elements began to wake up and joined the anti-rightist struggle.

    十八天“专政”
    李春
    长春电影制片厂乐团有一伙右派分子，在大鸣大放期间，借帮助党整风为名，经过一系列的密谋活动，推翻了乐团党支部的领导，成立所谓“代表民意”的主席团，完成了夺取领导权的行动。主席团于5月30日上台，至6月18日在全国反右派斗争的形势下宣布“完成了历史任务”，自动下台，实行了十八天的“专政”。在这期间，主席团派了“第一任驻京大使”去文化部电影局进行交涉，俨然是一个国家政府的样子。
    长影乐团的闹事是怎样鼓动起来的呢？原来在天津音乐学院学习的刘正谭，在大鸣大放时期，忽然回到长影乐团来。在乐团里到处点火煽动。刘正谭向许多人介绍外地鸣放的情况，宣传天津音乐学院搞得非常热闹，贴大字报，还公开地要求教务长下台，他说真解决问题，这才是“真正”的“民主”。刘还介绍师大和北影鸣放的经验，接着煽动人们说：“咱们乐团还这样风平浪静啊！”“乐团这么多年的问题，咱们在这次运动中要好好搞一下。”
    他的这些恶意的挑拨煽动，当时确实迷惑了一部分群众。一些对党不满的人聚集到他的周围，开始酝酿反党的行动。
    在这个反党小集团中，有三个党内的右派分子。其中的党支部的宣传委员方振祥是一个最凶狠的反党阴谋家。方一贯对党不满，仇视党。他在去年12月间曾给厂长和党委书记写了一封内容极端反动的信，诬蔑厂里对他“像机器和牛马一样”，还不如“过去开明的工厂主”。在大鸣大放期间，方振祥在党内党外的一切会议上进行煽动，恶意攻击党，积极进行幕后反党的策划，于是就被右派分子们拥为反党的首领，成为后来的主席团的主席。方振祥反党的手法是非常毒辣的，他不出面，叫群众出面，他说：“最好群众搞，有力量。党员犯了错误是政治上的错误，而你们（指非党员）即使出了问题，也是属于思想问题。”
    为了煽动群众，向党展开进攻，右派分子首先夺取了宣传工具。右派骨干分子吕小秋本来是团支部组织委员，不负责黑板报的工作，但是他没有同团支部任何委员商量，就自封为黑板报的“编委”，由他放出许多夸大和歪曲事实、煽动群众向党进攻的文章。5月25日，乐团的黑板报出现了第一篇煽动性的文章，题目是“乐团前途何在？”号召大家“团结起来，向官僚主义斗争”，诬蔑积极分子是“走狗”，威胁他们小心不要与官僚主义者“同归于尽”（此文是刘正谭和曾亚杰合写的）。还先后刊出“捧臭脚”等漫画，对领导人和积极分子尽情加以丑化和污蔑。
    右派分子背着党和行政领导，进行反党的密谋活动。他们先后举行三次秘密会议，策划如何推翻党支部的领导和成立主席团，并对主席团的人选预先作了安排。他们按照秘密会议中策划好的步骤，在5月30日全团的鸣放大会上展开了有计划的战斗。在大会上，他们公然提出反对由党支部和行政负责人组成的整风领导核心组来领导鸣放，说现在的领导不能代表群众，官僚主义者不能领导反对官僚主义，要求更换领导，另选出主席团来领导鸣放。右派分子左右了会场，会议被他们策划的阴谋搅乱了，群众受了蒙蔽，他们早已布置好的十二个人的主席团就这样产生了，于是他们推翻党的领导、夺取鸣放领导权的阴谋计划就完全实现。
    主席团下设有宣传组、专案组等机构，并曾提出肃反问题小组，企图检查党所领导的肃反工作，进行翻案，公开地向党挑战。
    长影乐团的党组织完全陷于瓦解状态，其中有些人变成了向党猖狂进攻的右派分子，或者是跟着右派分子走的人，其他一些人，在右派分子进攻的面前，也不能挺身出来战斗。
    在5月31日主席团上任的第一次会议上，会议执行主席刘正谭代表主席团发表了“宣言”。他首先从苏共二十次代表大会、波匈事件讲起，接着论述两类矛盾的相互转化，煽动群众把人民内部的矛盾演变为对抗性的矛盾。最后，他代表主席团宣布：“主席团决心完成任务，只要有一个问题不解决，我们决不解散！”
    主席团成立后，右派分子就更加明目张胆地进行反党活动。他们挑拨和扩大领导与群众的矛盾，鼓动群众拒绝接受工作任务，破坏了乐团演出计划和影片的录音工作，公开号召群众起来闹事，进京请愿。刘正谭和吕小秋在大会上煽动群众说：电影局统统是官僚主义者，和他们打交道没用，到国务院去讲道理！到中央去请愿！
    群众性的进京请愿没有搞起来，主席团就派“大使”去北京活动，企图同北影的右派分子联合起来为“体制问题”进行斗争。刘正谭以第一任“驻京大使”的身份给主席团写回三号报告。第一、二号报告因有不可告人的秘密，在反右派斗争开始时将原件烧掉了，仅保存了经过修改的报告，以应付追查。在第三号报告中说：“今天我去电影局遭到令人不能满意的结局”，建议主席团“把现在的情况向群众交底，让群众发表意见，然后整理群众意见（体制方案的和整风的），全体主席团协同群众意见来京与文化部坐谈（坐下来谈判）。”他汇报在新影活动的结果：“新影某些积极分子对我们很支援，并且曾建议我们三个乐团联合起来采取一致行动”。
    他们想把火烧到北京去，但由于反右派斗争开始，刘感到形势不利了，就匆忙地跑回长影。
    主席团活动不久，群众就开始感到有问题，认为主席团不合法，脱离党的领导。甚至有人议论：主席团就是匈牙利的工人委员会。这时，右派分子还十分嚣张，对指责他们的人加以威胁。后来，他们发觉群众对他们的反感愈来愈不可控制了，就改变策略，准备撤退，在最后一次大会上宣布主席团解散，说主席团“完成了历史任务”，“群众已经发动起来了”，“解决人民内部的矛盾应由党委亲自领导，主席团没有必要存在下去了。”同时，反咬党一口说：“有了党的领导，主席团有职无权，只起一个传声筒的作用，我们不解散干什么？”
    这个凶恶的反党小集团——主席团存在了十八天。他们对党的猖狂进攻被击退了，这个反党集团土崩瓦解了，有些右派分子已经低头认罪，有的还坚持反动立场，与党对抗，也没有什么力量了。一些曾被右派分子蒙蔽的群众，开始清醒过来，投入了反右派斗争。
