Xinhua News Agency, September 19th – Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan said in his speech at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China today (full text on page 4) that no force in the world can harm the traditional friendship between China and India, which has been accumulated for generations. In his speech, the Vice President repeatedly emphasized that both China and India advocate strengthening world peace, liberating all oppressed peoples, and peaceful coexistence with countries with different ideologies, and that their positions on several issues are consistent.

In his forty-minute speech, Vice President Radhakrishnan also criticized the current United Nations organization for not yet allowing all countries in the world to participate, lacking universality, and for not being able to correctly resolve many outstanding international issues through peaceful consultation. He said, "It is imperative to allow China, this great Asian country, to participate in the United Nations organization as soon as possible."

At 3:00 p.m., when the distinguished guest, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De and Chairman Liu Shaoqi, entered the Great Hall of the People and ascended the rostrum, the participants all stood up and applauded warmly for a long time.

In his speech, Vice President Radhakrishnan also elaborated in detail on the meaning and role of democratic politics.

At the end of his speech, he extended heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Indian government and the Indian people to the Chinese people for achieving unprecedented prosperity and progress. His speech was interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi first delivered a speech (full text on page 4) before Vice President Radhakrishnan's speech, expressing a warm welcome to the outstanding Indian statesman and scholar. After Radhakrishnan's speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi once again expressed his heartfelt thanks for the guest's speech. Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that China and its great neighbor India have many common hopes, problems, and goals, "We should unite and work together for the prosperity and progress of the two peoples, for peace in Asia and the world, and for the progress of mankind."

Sitting on the rostrum with Vice President Radhakrishnan were Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Vice Premiers Deng Zihui, He Long, Chen Yi, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, and Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru.

    没有任何力量可以伤害印中友谊
    据新华社19日讯　印度共和国副总统拉达克里希南今天下午在我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大会议上发表的演讲（全文见第四版）中说，世界上没有任何力量可以伤害印中两国世世代代积累下来的传统友谊。副总统在演讲中一再强调中印两国都主张加强世界和平，解放一切被压迫人民以及与具有不同意识形态的国家和平共处，在若干问题上的主张都是一致的。
    在四十分钟的演讲中，拉达克里希南副总统还批评了目前的联合国组织还没有能让世界上的所有国家参加，缺乏普遍性，并且这个组织还没有能够正确地用和平协商的办法解决国际上许多悬而未决的问题。他说，“尽快地让中国这个伟大的亚洲国家参加联合国组织是非常必要的。”
    下午三时，当这位尊敬的贵宾由朱德副主席和刘少奇委员长陪同步入怀仁堂的大厅登上主席台时，参加会议的人们一致起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌。

    刘少奇委员长在拉达克里希南副总统演讲前，首先致词（全文见第四版）对这位印度杰出的政治家和学者表示热烈欢迎。在拉达克里希南演讲后，刘少奇委员长再次对贵宾的演讲表示衷心的谢意。刘少奇委员长说，中国和伟大的邻邦印度之间有着许多共同的希望、问题和目标，“我们应该团结一致，为两国人民的繁荣和进步，为亚洲与世界和平以及为人类的进步共同努力。”
    同拉达克里希南副总统一起在主席台上就座的，有副委员长林伯渠、李济深、罗荣桓、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通，副总理邓子恢、贺龙、陈毅，最高人民法院院长董必武，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞和印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁。
