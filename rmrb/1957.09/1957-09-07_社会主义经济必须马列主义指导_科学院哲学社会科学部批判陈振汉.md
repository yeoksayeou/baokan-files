Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a forum from the 3rd to the 5th to expose and criticize the bourgeois rightists' political conspiracy to restore bourgeois economics, and exposed the true face of the rightist Chen Zhenhan, who drafted the so-called "Some Opinions on Current Economic Science Work," as being anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Marxist.

The meeting pointed out that the rightist Chen Zhenhan was carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies under the guise of "academic" pursuits. He colluded with Xu Yuzhan and Luo Zhiru, members of the China Democratic League, Gu Chunfan, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, Wu Baosan, a member of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Ning Jiafeng, a member of the Jiusan Society, to draft this so-called "Opinion Paper," in which they openly put forward the political demand for bourgeois right-wing economists to take power. Under the guise of so-called "participation in discussions" and "soliciting opinions in advance," he attempted to allow bourgeois right-wing "economists" to interfere in the decision-making of national economic construction; under the guise of so-called "absorption" and "utilization" of bourgeois economics, he attempted to replace Marxist economics with bourgeois economics to guide the national economic construction work, so as to deviate our country's economic construction from the socialist road and realize the conspiracy to restore the capitalist system.

At the meeting, many economists pointed out that the rightist Chen Zhenhan's wanton attacks on the Communist Party's leadership of national economic work and his obliteration of the great achievements of our country's socialist economic construction in the "Opinion Paper" were aimed at enabling the rightists to come to power. They said, if the leaders of our country's economic work, as Chen Zhenhan said, do not even understand the economic common sense of "inflation," how could they have put forward the slogan of striving for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure, a balance of cash revenue and expenditure, and a balance of material supply and demand in March 1950, achieved a balance of national financial revenue and expenditure, curbed inflation for twelve years, and stabilized prices? If our country's economic construction work was really "try and try again" and "blindly groping," and "did not follow any objective economic laws," how could we have achieved great achievements in economic recovery and construction, and made our country's industrial growth 31% in 1956, making it the fastest-growing industrial country in the world that year?

At the meeting, economists refuted the "Opinion Paper's" slander against Marxism and Marxist-Leninist economics. It was pointed out that the "Opinion Paper" stated that Marxism-Leninism is equivalent to dogmatism, and that Marxist-Leninist economics is "outdated," which is to create a basis for the restoration of bourgeois economics. Yang Peixin of the Financial Research Institute of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China said that Chen Zhenhan's statement that Marxism-Leninism does not have a set of "plans" (previously called "laws") for socialist economic construction that applies to all countries is completely unfounded. The "Communist Manifesto," "Critique of the Gotha Program," and other works, as well as the Chinese Communist Party's policies on the socialist transformation of industry, agriculture, and capitalist industry and commerce, all illustrate that Marxist-Leninist economics has a complete set of theories in this regard. Establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, realizing the nationalization of industry, the collectivization of agriculture, developing socialist economy and culture in a planned way, gradually improving the people's living standards, and preparing conditions for the transition to communism are all universally applicable truths. Engels' theory put forward in "Anti-Dühring" in 1877 had foreseen the laws of socialist construction. For eighty years, this law has been proven by practice. Chen Zhenhan ridiculed Marxism as "monks chanting scriptures," which can only prove Chen Zhenhan's reactionary stance. Marxism has guided countries with a population of 900 million to complete the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The speed of economic construction in these countries far exceeds that of capitalist countries. This great victory of Marxism proves that Marxist theory is a vigorous guide to action. Wang Yanan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out in his speech at the meeting that because Marxist political economy is guided by the world outlook of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, grows up in the practice of the working class's revolutionary struggle against the bourgeoisie, and is enriched and developed by the experience of economic construction in the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, saying that Marxist political economy is a dogma is just a shameless slander.

At the meeting, some people exposed Chen Zhenhan's consistent comprador-bourgeois reactionary stance and views. Yan Zhongping, deputy director of the Institute of Economics, exposed Chen Zhenhan's long-standing comprador-bourgeois reactionary views. He said that Chen Zhenhan had advocated more than ten years ago that the so-called increase in foreign capital and foreign factories in China would not hinder but would help "the accumulation of national capital," because "the result of foreign capital input or foreigners running factories in China, like national capital, is to increase the productive capacity of the people of the country, that is, to increase their income." Fan Hong, a professor at Peking University, exposed Chen Zhenhan's advocacy of the so-called "competition equilibrium theory" to promote the superiority of capitalism, saying that under the capitalist system, competition can balance deviations in production, while economic construction under the socialist system will produce serious deviations, and because socialism will inevitably produce bureaucracy, these deviations cannot be eliminated.

The speakers at the meeting expressed dissatisfaction with Chen Zhenhan's two "confessions," pointing out that his attitude was extremely dishonest and did not touch on the essence of the problem.

In this three-day forum, more than 20 economic scientists criticized and exposed Chen Zhenhan, and more than 20 people did not have the opportunity to speak due to time constraints.

### 社会主义经济必须马列主义指导  科学院哲学社会科学部批判陈振汉

    社会主义经济必须马列主义指导
    科学院哲学社会科学部批判陈振汉
    新华社6日讯　中国科学院哲学社会科学部在3日到5日举行座谈会，揭发和批判了资产阶级右派企图使资产阶级经济学复辟的政治阴谋，暴露了起草所谓“对于当前经济科学工作的一些意见”的右派分子陈振汉的反共、反社会主义和反马克思主义的真面目。
    会上指出，右派分子陈振汉是披着“学术”的外衣，在进行反共反社会主义的阴谋活动，他纠合民盟成员徐毓枬、罗志如，民革成员谷春帆，民进成员巫宝三，九三成员宁嘉风草拟出这个所谓“意见书”，在这里面公开提出让资产阶级右派经济学家上台的政治要求。他以所谓“参预讨论”和“事先征求意见”为幌子，企图让资产阶级右派“经济学家”染指于国家经济建设的决策；他以所谓“吸收”和“利用”资产阶级经济学为幌子，企图以资产阶级经济学代替马克思主义经济学来指导国家经济建设工作，这样来使我国的经济建设脱离社会主义的道路，实现使资本主义制度复辟的阴谋。
    会上，许多经济学家指出，右派分子陈振汉在“意见书”中肆意攻击共产党对国家经济工作的领导，抹煞我国社会主义经济建设的伟大成绩，就是为了达到让右派分子上台的目的。他们说，如果我国的经济工作领导人真像陈振汉所说的连“通货膨胀”这样的经济常识都不懂，怎能在1950年3月就提出争取财政收支平衡、现金收支平衡、物资供求平衡的口号，实现了国家财政收支平衡、制止了十二年来的通货膨胀，稳定了物价呢？如果我们国家的经济建设工作真是“碰碰试试”、“盲目摸索”，“并未遵循什么客观经济规律”，难道还能取得经济恢复和建设的巨大成绩，并且在1956年使我国工业增长31％，成为这一年中世界上工业增长最快的国家吗？
    会上，经济学家们驳斥了“意见书”中对马克思主义及马列主义经济学的污蔑。指出“意见书”中说马列主义等同于教条主义，说马列主义经济学“过时”了，就是为恢复资产阶级经济学制造根据。中国人民银行总行金融研究所杨培新说，陈振汉说马列主义没有一套放之四海皆准的社会主义经济建设的“方案”（先说是“规律”）是毫无事实根据的。“共产党宣言” “哥达纲领批判”等著作以及中国共产党关于对工业、农业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造的政策都说明马列主义经济学在这方面是有一套完整的理论的。建立无产阶级专政，实现工业国有化，农业集体化，有计划地发展社会主义经济、文化，逐步提高人民生活水平，准备条件向共产主义过渡，这就是放之四海而皆准的真理。恩格斯在1877年在“反杜林论”中提出的理论，已预见到社会主义建设的规律，八十年来，这个规律已为实践所证明。陈振汉把马克思主义嘲笑为“和尚念经”，这只能证明陈振汉的反动立场。马克思主义指导了九亿人口的国家完成了民主革命和社会主义革命，这些国家的经济建设的速度远远超过资本主义国家，马克思主义的这个伟大胜利，证明了马克思主义理论是生气勃勃的行动的指南。中国科学院学部委员王亚南在会上的发言中指出由于马克思主义政治经济学是以辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观为指导的，是在工人阶级反对资产阶级的革命斗争实践中生长起来的，是为苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的经济建设的经验所丰富和发展起来的，说马克思主义政治经济学是教条，只是一种无耻的污蔑。
    会上有人揭发了陈振汉一贯的买办资产阶级的反动立场、观点。经济研究所副所长严中平揭发了陈振汉由来已久的买办资产阶级的反动观点，他说，陈振汉在十多年前就主张所谓在中国的外国资本和外国工厂增加的结果并不阻碍而且帮助“民族资本的积累”，说是因为“外国资本输入或外国人在中国办工厂的结果，与民族资本一样，是增加本国人民的生产能力，也就是增加他们的所得”。北京大学教授樊弘揭露陈振汉以主张所谓“竞争平衡论”来宣扬资本主义的优越性，说是在资本主义制度下通过竞争可以使生产中偏差得到平衡，而社会主义制度下的经济建设却会产生严重的偏差，并且因为社会主义必然产生官僚主义，所以这种偏差不可能消除。
    在会上发言的人对陈振汉的两次“交代”表示不满，指出他的态度是极不老实的，没有接触问题的实质。
    在这三天的座谈会上，有二十多位经济科学工作者对陈振汉进行了批判和揭发，还有二十多人因为时间限制没有得到发言的机会。
