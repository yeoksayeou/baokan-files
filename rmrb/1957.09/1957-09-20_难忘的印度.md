　　Unforgettable India
    I knew about India when I was four or five years old, before I could read. My mother told me the story of Tang Sanzang's journey to the West to obtain scriptures. She said that there was a beautiful country in the West, where the people were good-looking and intelligent, the waters were green and the mountains were lush, and many sages were born there. That place was called "Tianzhu" (India). As I grew older, I gradually learned that many beautiful sculptures, paintings, poems, scriptures, brilliant myths, and Indian silks, as well as the lingering fragrance of sandalwood burned at home during festivals, all embellished our lives. Whenever I thought of India, I was filled with a sense of warmth and joy.
    Every Chinese person has this feeling towards India. In the two thousand years of historical connection between China and India, there has never been a cry of war. What has passed between the two countries are constant peaceful envoys seeking knowledge, culture, and prosperous life. Such a beautiful and harmonious neighbor is hard to find in history.
    If the cultural exchange between China and India is like the ceaseless flow of the Ganges and the Yangtze River, then today, after gaining independence and freedom, the people of these two countries are like these two mighty rivers rushing for thousands of miles, converging into a boundless ocean of jubilation.
    Premier Zhou Enlai said to the Indian people: "We can say without any sense of shame that the friendly relations between us today surpass any period in history." This is exactly what each of us wants to say.
    There is a metaphor learned from India in Chinese, "Ganges River sands," which means as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges River. Since liberation, the number of artists, poets, singers, dancers, scientists, lecturing professors, and students seeking knowledge who have traveled between China and India can already be described using this metaphor.
    Anyone who has been to India cannot forget the feelings of the Indian people towards us. When our plane landed at the airport from the azure sky of New Delhi, we were greeted by a sea of enthusiastic people, joyful laughter, and sparkling, moving eyes full of friendship. I have never seen so many beautiful people, as if they were long-separated relatives reunited. Petals were scattered on our heads, I couldn't name the flowers, and I couldn't see how many soft arms were putting garlands on us. They sprinkled flower water on our heads and dotted our foreheads with precious red powder. They spread red earth on the road to welcome guests from the other side of the Himalayas. We have many ethnic groups, and India has many languages. We don't speak the same language, but as soon as we meet, we shake our heads, clap our hands, and sing excitedly: "Hindi Chini bhai bhai! (India and China are brothers!)" Because that fiery song truly sings out the surging emotions in our hearts.
    Wherever we went, large cities, small towns, rural villages, and factories, we encountered the same kind of affectionate and enthusiastic language and welcome. The stars in the Indian sky are as beautiful as the numerous reliefs, buildings, fountains, gardens, murals, palaces, and castles that dot the ground in India, but even more moving are the hearts of each and every Indian friend.
    In every city we visited, countless Indian friends invited us to stay in their homes and chat happily with their wives and children. At many literary and art evenings, many poets wrote moving new poems praising our friendship. They recited them so well, as if they were old friends talking to our hearts. How enchanting is Indian music and dance! From large cities to small towns, musicians and dancers brought us joy from the bottom of their hearts like immortals. It was truly "petal-like fingers, meteor-like eyes, telling of the friendship between us" (lines from poet Yuan Shuipai).
    In Hindi, the pronunciation of the words "sugar" and "China" are similar. Our Indian friends joked with us, saying: "Whenever I think of Chinese people, I have a sweet feeling." The Chinese people feel the same way about Indians. Whenever we think of our Indian friends, we feel calm, affectionate, and like a boundless lake of wisdom. Talking with Indian friends, we feel their rich cultural cultivation. They speak in a gentle and pleasant manner, and we also feel that they are so kind and amiable, with a kind of灵气(spiritual energy) revealed in everyone's eyes.
    The Indian people are extraordinarily enthusiastic. When we went to the villages and small towns of India, we felt even more deeply the sea-like affection of the Indian people for the Chinese people. A writer who had been to India told me that once, they were on a public bus, passing through a small town, and stopped for a moment. The Indians in the town unexpectedly saw friends from New China. All the farmers, vendors, repair station employees, and crane operators ran over to greet them warmly, politely, and with great affection. That moment of simple, sincere, and enthusiastic exchange will never be forgotten.
    When the Chinese delegation traveled by train to visit various parts of India, the large and small stations along the way were crowded with people. Men, women, old, and young held garlands, sprinkled flower water, and sang moving songs, welcoming us along the stations. In the middle of the night, they often held torches and lanterns on the platforms, waiting for our train under the Indian sky, where the stars twinkled like gems. Sometimes we passed through many such stations, large and small, in one night.
    Once, while everyone was half asleep, the train stopped. There were many gentle hands knocking on the door. We quickly jumped out of the car and saw the sparkling, luminous eyes of countless Indians, smiling at us under the dim sky. Those who welcomed us gave gifts and smeared the bodies of our good Chinese friends with fragrant ointments. When a cool breeze blew, they also brought each disembarking guest a cup of hot coffee. Songs, laughter, endless joy, and inexhaustible courtesy and friendship.
    But with a whistle, we suddenly realized that the few minutes of the stop had flashed by in the blink of an eye. In a state of excitement and gratitude, we had even forgotten to ask: "Which town in India is this?" Then we separated from this group of people burning with friendship like flames.
    As the car drove away, we only saw in the faint dawn light a large group of people, unfamiliar, but deeply connected to us, waving their hands and holding up children. Far away, the breeze blew on their gradually shrinking fluttering headscarves and "saris." Our eyes were full of tears, and our hearts were completely left with them. Although we don't know the name of this town, this is India, this is the feeling of millions of Indian people for people from New China.
    "Give a Chinese name!" How many young Indian mothers wanted us to leave a Chinese friendship for her baby. The children of India are so lovely, their long eyelashes, big eyes, black and bright, emit extraordinary radiance. In many kindergartens, we saw them happily singing Indian children's songs and performing Indian dances. They reminded us of the children of our motherland. These two kinds of children, with different languages and costumes, all like distant guests so much. When they see guests, they can't help but reach out their chubby little hands and cheer, as if their own relatives had arrived.
    The time in India was so precious, we all wished we could load it by the cart and bring back the knowledge and wisdom we gained and share it with our relatives and friends. Every place in India is so beautiful, every place is like a dream. We cannot forget Jaipur, the "pale red city," we cannot forget the magnificent and splendid "Ajanta," the clear, beautiful, and poetic "Taj Mahal." In some places, peacocks are as common as chickens, and parrots fly around like pigeons. But what we will always remember in our hearts is the solemn and beautiful New Delhi. The vast grasslands, the huge buildings, the presidential palace built of red sandstone, the Parliament building that combines Indian style and modern architectural features, and the countless historical sites and scenic spots, all remind people of our Beijing.
    After independence, the construction of the Indian people makes us proud of India. The irrigation system of Bakra-Nangal, the train carriage factory near Madras, and other huge constructions made us happy to see. The peace-loving and singing Indian people are moving forward on the road of modern industrialization.
    In recent years, Indian poetry, novels, dramas, and essays have been translated into Chinese in large quantities and have been warmly praised and loved by a wide range of Chinese readers. Indian music, dance, and movies have become a part of our lives. Not only our singers, but even college students and children can sing one or two Indian songs they like. Our radio stations often broadcast Indian music, which is a favorite program of the Chinese people. When the outstanding Indian dancers Mr. Uday Shankar and the Kalama sisters visited China, their performances became a festival of our art. Many viewers praised that they had rarely appreciated such perfect dance.
    Indian films have penetrated into every corner of our country. Watching Indian films has become our habit. Excellent films such as "Two Acres of Land," "The Vagabond," and the recently presented "The Queen of Jhansi" have strengthened the understanding and friendship between our two peoples. This year, the China Youth Art Theatre in the capital performed the classic drama "Shakuntala" by the great Indian poet Kalidasa. This immortal masterpiece has captivated hundreds of thousands of Chinese audiences.
    Chinese writers and poets who visited India have written many beautiful poems, essays, and reports, recording their unforgettable impressions of India.
    Recently, the Indian travelogue "India, We Will Never Forget You!" written by writer Yan Wenjing for children is an excellent literary work. The author used simple, vivid, and beautiful language to write so truly and movingly about what he saw in India. Thanks to his beautiful, concise writing and authentic materials, it makes me even more miss beautiful India. I also used a lot of his materials in writing this article.
    Whenever I think of India, it's like seeing the sky, white clouds, and branches and leaves on the shore reflected in the lake, so fresh and clear. As soon as I close my eyes, I seem to see the shooting stars in the Indian sky and the flames hidden in the hearts of the Indian people. Peace and friendship are the virtues passed down to us by our ancestors. We have gone through countless hardships and bloody struggles to establish today's independent and free country.
    In the past, India was called "the jewel in the crown of Victoria" by imperialists. Today, this magical jewel has been grasped in India's own hands. How happy we are that we have such a great neighbor beside us, standing up, with boundless confidence and strength in the cause of peace - India.
    Thinking of our friendship, a vast and boundless singing of people surges in my heart. That singing is full of confidence and joy, crossing the Himalayas, weaving into a great voice: "Hindi Chini bhai bhai! (India and China are brothers!)"
    We will continue to sing so enthusiastically and sincerely, generation after generation, for all ages.

　　难忘的印度
    我知道印度，是我还在四、五岁的时候，我还不认识字。我的母亲给我讲唐僧取经的故事，她说，西方有一个美丽的国家，那里的人好看，聪明，水绿山青，出了许多圣贤，那个地方叫“天竺”。我大了，慢慢知道从那个地方传来的许多美丽的雕刻、图画、诗歌、经文、灿烂的神话故事以及印度丝绸和节日家里燃起的檀香木氤氲的幽香，都点缀了我们的生活，使我一想起印度，便充满了亲切的喜悦之感。
    每一个中国人对印度都有这样的感觉。中国和印度两千年悠久的历史联系里，听不见一声战争的喊叫，来往于两国之间的是不断的求知识、求文化、求生活繁荣的和平使节。这样美好、和谐的邻居是历史里找不到的。
    如果说中印两国文化交流像恒河和长江一样不舍昼夜地长流不息，今天这两国人民，获得了独立和自由之后，就像这两条奔泻千里的巨流，汇聚在一个无边的欢腾的海洋里了。
    周恩来总理对印度人民说：“我们可以毫无愧色地说，今天我们之间的友好关系超过了历史上的任何时期。”这正是我们每一个人心里想说的话。
    中国有一句从印度学来的比喻，“恒河沙数”，是说多得像恒河的沙粒一样。解放后，中印两国来往的艺术家、诗人、歌唱家、舞蹈家、科学家、讲学的教授、求知识的留学生们已经可以用上这个比喻了。
    凡是到过印度的人，都不能忘记印度人民对我们的感情。当我们的飞机从新德里蔚蓝的天空上降落在机场的时候，像海洋一般热烈的人群，欢乐的笑声，闪亮、动人、充满了友情的眼睛，欢迎我们。我从来没有见过那样多美丽的，如同久别重聚的亲人。花瓣洒在我们的头上，我说不出花的名字，看不清多少双柔软的手臂给我们戴上花环。他们在我们头顶上洒了花水，额上点着珍贵的红粉。他们把红土铺在路上，欢迎从喜马拉雅山那一面来的客人。我们有许多种民族，印度有许多种语言，我们话不相通，可是一见面，我们摇着头，拍着手，兴奋地歌唱起：“印地秦尼巴依巴依！（印度中国是兄弟！）……”因为那只火热的歌真正唱出我们心里奔腾的感情。
    无论我们走到哪里，大城、小镇、农村和工厂，我们遇见同样亲切、热烈的语言和欢迎。印度天空上的繁星是和点缀在印度地面上众多的浮雕、建筑、喷泉、花园、壁画、宫殿、城堡一样的美丽，但是更动人的是一个个印度朋友的心。
    我们每到一个城市，便有无数的印度朋友邀我们到他们家里住，和他们的妻子儿女欢谈。在多次文艺晚会上，多少诗人写了动人的新诗赞颂我们的友谊，他们诵读得那样好，如同多年的老朋友和我们谈心。印度的音乐和舞蹈是多么迷人！从大城到小镇，音乐家、舞蹈家们像仙人一般给我们带来了来自心底的欢喜，真是“花瓣般的手指，流星般的眼睛，倾诉着我们之间的友谊”（诗人袁水拍的诗句）。
    在印地文里，“糖”和“中国”这两个字的发音是相近的，我们的印度朋友对我们谈笑着说：“一想起中国人，便有一种甜蜜的感觉。”中国人对印度人也是如此。我们一想起印度朋友来，便觉得恬静，亲切，像一望无边的智慧的湖一样。和印度朋友们谈话，就感到他们的丰富的文化修养，谈起话来娓娓动听，我们还感到他们是那样和易可喜，每个人的眼里透露出一种灵气。
    印度人民是异常热情的。到了印度的乡村、小镇，我们更感觉出印度人民对中国人民海一般的深情。一个到过印度的作家告诉我，有一次，他们搭公共汽车，路过一个小镇，停留了片刻。镇上的印度人出其不意地看见了新中国的朋友。所有的农民、小贩、修理站的职员和开起重机的工人都跑来热情地向他们打招呼，亲切、有礼，那一刹那朴素、真诚、热情的交往，使他们永难忘记。
    中国的代表团搭火车到印度各地访问的时候，沿途大小车站都挤满了人群。男女老少举着花环，洒着花水，唱着动人的歌曲，沿站欢迎我们。半夜里，他们在月台上往往举着火把，持着灯火，在印度的繁星像宝石一样眨着眼睛的天空下，等待着我们的列车。我们有时一夜经过大大小小许多这样的车站。
    有一次，大家在睡眼蒙胧中，车停了。车门有许多轻柔的手在敲着。我们赶紧从车里跳出来，看见无数印度人的闪耀发光的大眼睛，在薄明的天空下向我们微笑。欢迎我们的人赠送了礼物，在中国的好朋友身上抹上香料做的膏油。在习习凉风吹来的时候，又给每位下车的客人送来一杯热腾腾的咖啡。歌声、笑语，说不尽的欢喜的情绪，道不完的殷勤和友谊。
    但是汽笛一声，突然察觉停车的几分钟已经眨眼一般闪过。我们在兴奋、感激的情绪中，竟然忘记问：“这是印度的哪一个城镇？”便和这群火焰一般燃着友谊的人们分开。
    车开远了，只看见曦微的晨光中，一大群不相识的，但是又深深和我们连着的人们，向我们摇着手，举着孩子们。远远，微风吹动了他们渐渐小了的飘展的头巾和“纱丽”。我们的眼睛满蓄着泪光，我们的心已经完全留在他们那里。尽管我们不知道这个城镇的名字，但这就是印度，就是千百万印度人民对来自新中国的人的感情。
    “起一个中国名字吧！”多少印度年青的母亲要我们为她的婴儿留下中国人的友谊。印度的孩童是那样可爱，他们的长睫毛、大眼睛，黑亮黑亮的发出异常的光采。我们在许多幼儿园里，看见他们欢喜地唱着印度的儿歌，表演着印度的舞蹈。他们使我们想起祖国的孩子们。这两种言语，服饰不同的孩子们，都是那样喜欢远方的客人，见了客人都不由得伸出那胖胖的小手，欢呼叫喊，如同来了自己的亲人。
    在印度的时光是那样的宝贵，我们都恨不得车载斗量，把得来的知识和智慧带回来，分给自己的亲友。印度的每一个地方都那样美丽，每一个地方都像一个梦境。我们忘记不了斋浦尔“淡红色的城”，我们忘记不了宏伟、壮丽的“阿旃陀”，明净、瑰丽、诗一般的“泰吉陵”。有些地方孔雀多得像鸡一样普遍，鹦鹉像鸽子一样飞来飞去。但使我们永远记在心里的，是庄严、美丽的新德里。辽阔的草地，巨大的建筑，用红色砂石筑成的总统府，融合了印度风格和现代建筑特色的国会大厦和数不尽的古迹胜地，它使人想起我们的北京。
    独立后，印度人民的建设使我们为印度骄傲。巴克拉——南迦尔的灌溉系统、马德拉斯附近的火车车厢工厂和其他巨大的建设，都使我们看了高兴。爱和平、爱歌唱的印度人民正在近代工业化的道路上向前迈进。
    这几年来，印度的诗歌、小说、戏剧、散文已经大量地译成中文，受到广大的中国读者的热烈的赞誉和喜爱。印度的音乐、舞蹈和电影成了我们生活的一部分。不只是我们的歌唱家，连大学生、儿童都会唱出一两首他们喜欢的印度歌曲。我们的广播电台经常播送印度的音乐，这是中国人喜爱的节目。卓越的印度舞蹈家乌黛·香卡先生和卡拉玛姐妹访问中国的时候，他们的表演成了我们艺术的节日。多少观众赞美地说，他们很少欣赏过这样完美的舞蹈。
    印度的电影已经深入到我国的各个角落。看印度电影成了我们的癖好。优秀的影片像“两亩地”、“流浪者”和最近献演的“章西女皇”，加强了我们两国人民之间的了解和友情。今年，首都的中国青年艺术剧院演出了印度伟大的诗人迦梨陀娑的古典戏剧“沙恭达罗”。这部不朽的杰作使成千上万的中国观众拜倒。
    访问印度回来的中国作家、诗人写了不少优美的诗歌、散文、通讯，记载他们对印度难忘的印象。
    最近，作家严文井同志为儿童们写的印度游记“印度，我们永远不会忘记你！”就是一本优秀的文学著作。作者用朴素、生动、优美的文笔，那样真实、感人地写出他所看见的印度。感谢他的美丽、凝炼的文笔和真实的材料，它使我更怀念美丽的印度。我写这篇东西，也引用了不少他的材料。
    我一想起印度，就像看见映在湖水里的天空、白云、岸边的枝叶，那样清新、明彻。我一闭上眼，就仿佛看见印度天空上的流星和印度人民心里藏蓄着的火焰。和平，友好，是我们祖先传给我们的美德。我们经过千辛万苦，血汗的斗争才建立了今天独立、自由的国家。
    往昔的印度被帝国主义者称为“维多利亚皇冠的宝石”。今天，这块神奇的宝石已经掌握在印度自己的手里。我们是多么欢喜，我们身旁有了这样一个伟大的，站起来的，对和平事业有无限信心和力量的邻居——印度。
    想起了我们的友谊，我的心中就涌起浩瀚无边的人群的歌唱。那歌唱充满了信心和欢喜，越过喜马拉雅山，交织成一个伟大的声音：“印地秦尼巴依巴依！（印度中国是兄弟！）……”
    我们永不停息地这样热情、真诚地歌唱下去，子子孙孙，传至万代。
