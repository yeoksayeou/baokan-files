　　Caught Up with the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive

　　The No. 2273 locomotive driven by the Xu Xingwang crew of the Guye Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration has safely traveled over one million kilometers. This is the second crew in China's railways, following the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew, to create a record of one million kilometers of safe operation without accidents for a freight locomotive.

　　In the nearly eight years since 1950, the Xu Xingwang crew has actively studied and promoted advanced experience, continuously improving their operating skills and ensuring the safety of the locomotive's operation. From 1951 to September 4th of this year, this crew has saved the country more than 1,786 tons of coal and 12,843 yuan in material costs. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　赶上了“毛泽东号”
    北京铁路管理局古冶机务段徐兴旺包乘组驾驶的二二七三号机车，已经安全行驶一百万公里以上。这是我国铁路继“毛泽东号”机车包乘组之后第二个创造货运机车安全行驶百万公里无事故纪录的包乘组。
    徐兴旺包乘组从1950年以来的近八年当中，积极地学习和推广先进经验，使操作技术不断提高，保证了机车行驶的安全。自从1951年到今年9月4日，这个包乘组共给国家节约煤一千七百八十六吨多，节省材料费一万二千八百四十三元。（据新华社讯）
