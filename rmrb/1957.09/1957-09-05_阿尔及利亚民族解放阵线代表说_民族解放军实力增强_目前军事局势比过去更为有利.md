Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 4th: Ahmed Tewfik El Madani, Director of the Algerian National Liberation Front office in Cairo, said on September 3rd that the military situation in Algeria is currently more favorable to the Algerian people than at any time in the past.

At a press conference, he said that the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown in both numbers and combat effectiveness, and its organization is also more rigorous than before. In the autumn of this year (the war season in Algeria), the National Liberation Army may surprise the French military command.

He said that the Algerian people are more willing than ever to sacrifice for the cause of independence. The influence of the National Liberation Front has strengthened and has actually spread to all regions of Algeria. Madani said that the United Nations had made recommendations advocating a peaceful and democratic solution to the Algerian problem based on the United Nations Charter, but France had not taken steps to implement this recommendation.

He also said that all the countries visited by representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front had expressed their support for Algerian independence. Therefore, France has sent envoys to visit some countries, asking them to support the French aggression against Algeria.

    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表说
    民族解放军实力增强
    目前军事局势比过去更为有利
    据新华社开罗4日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线驻开罗办事处主任艾哈迈德·陶菲克·迈达尼9月3日说，阿尔及利亚的军事局势目前比过去任何时候都更对阿尔及利亚人民有利。
    他在记者招待会上说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在数量上和战斗力上都有了增长，而且它的组织也比以前更为严密了。在今年秋季（阿尔及利亚进行战争的季节），民族解放军可能使法军司令部感到意外的震惊。
    他说，阿尔及利亚人民比以前任何时候都更愿意为独立事业而牺牲。民族解放阵线的影响加强了，并且实际上遍及阿尔及利亚的一切地区。迈达尼说，联合国曾经提出建议，主张根据联合国宪章取得阿尔及利亚问题的和平、民主的解决办法，但是法国并没有采取步骤执行这个建议。
    他还说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表访问过的所有国家都表示支持阿尔及利亚独立。因此法国就派遣使节访问一些国家，要求它们支持法国侵略阿尔及利亚。
