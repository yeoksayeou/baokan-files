    Rational Revision of Quotas
    In the big-character posters in some factories in Shenyang, many workers have raised the issue of rationally revising quotas. The following are excerpts from some of them.
    The Retrogressive "Quota"
    The work-hour quota in our factory is very problematic. This is specifically reflected in the formulation of the 1958 planned quota, where most of them have not been lowered, remaining at the same level as the fourth quarter of 1957, and some are even lower. This is, of course, unreasonable. Due to the backwardness of the quota, although the tasks for 1958 have increased a lot, they are all achieved by increasing machine tools and adding more shifts. We hope that relevant departments will pay attention to this issue. (Employee of Shenyang Screw Factory)
    The State Suffers, Individuals Benefit
    The comprehensive quota in our factory is a backward quota, which does not promote production. The comprehensive quota for some cars is fifty points (hours), but a worker can finish it in one work day! As some foremen said: "Just walk around and take a look at the car, and you get paid." This quota was implemented in February, March, and April and is already outdated. We hope it will be improved quickly. (Zhao Baolin, HuangguTuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory)
    Actively Propose Advanced Quotas
    When formulating planned work-hour quotas, we must ensure that individual interests are subordinate to national interests, so that labor productivity can be continuously improved and a socialist life can arrive sooner. In this quota revision, I must actively revise the quota to be advanced. For example, the previous quota for a certain "substitute cabinet" was 32, and this time it must be increased to 45; the previous quota for a certain card seat was 16, and this time it must be increased to 28. (Liu Xueye, Grinder, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory)
    Based on the principle of combining national interests and individual interests, we must break with conservative thinking and revise piecework work-hour quotas. The following are the main component work-hour quotas that I personally propose to revise: A certain air valve is to be raised from 192 to 320; a certain choke valve is to be raised from 160 to 320; a certain valve cover is to be raised from 192 to 240. (Cui Pei, Grinder, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory)
    It is Wrong to Accommodate Backwardness
    When doing piecework, individual workers in the assembly section always want to find opportunities to benefit themselves, saying that this work is big and that work is deformed, and they must be given some additional work hours, otherwise they will stop working. When the section chief hears that the workers have stopped working, he gets worried, thinking that as long as the task can be completed, it is okay to give them extra work hours. If the quota clerk refuses, the section chief will go to the workshop director to resolve it, and the director not only does not criticize them but is always particularly generous, saying to give them the extra work hours if needed. In July of this year, there were eight bed saddles that were neither deformed nor with large tolerances, but at the end of the month, the section chief insisted on paying an extra five points per bed saddle, and said that the director had approved it. The quota clerk had no choice, and as a result, each bed saddle was given 18 points, totaling 144 points. Similar things that accommodate the backward thinking of workers happen frequently. We hope that the factory leadership will educate and correct this. (Lu Jingfang, No. 5 Workshop, Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory)

### 合理修订定额

    合理修订定额
    在沈阳一些工厂里的大字报上，不少工人提出了合理修改定额的问题，下边就是其中一部分的摘录。
    倒退的“定额”
    我们厂的工时定额很成问题。具体反映在1958年计划定额的编制上，大部都没有降低，与1957年第四季的水平一样，甚至有的还要低，这当然是说不过去的。由于定额的不先进，因此1958年的任务虽增加很多，但是都以增加机床，多开班次的措施来实现的。希望有关部门重视这个问题。（沈阳螺钉厂职工）
    国家吃亏，个人得利
    我们工厂的综合定额是落后的定额，对生产起不到推动作用。有的小车综合定额为五十个点（小时），结果一个工就干完啦！正像有的工长说的：在车上走一走，看一看，就给钱。这种定额是二、三、四月份实行的，早已过时了，希迅速改进。（皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂赵宝林）
    主动提出先进定额
    制订计划工时定额时，一定要使个人利益服从国家利益，这样才能使劳动生产率不断提高，社会主义生活早日到来。我在这次修改定额中，一定要主动把定额修订得先进。如某“代柜”过去的定额是三十二个，这次一定要提高到四十五个；某卡座过去的定额是十六个，这次一定要提高到二十八个。（沈阳风动工具厂磨工刘学业）
    本着国家利益和个人利益相结合的原则，我们要打破保守思想修改计件工时定额。下边是我个人提出的要修改的主要部件工时定额：某风阀由一百九十二个提高到三百二十个；某阻塞阀由一百六十个提高到三百二十个；某阀盖由一百九十二个提高到二百四十个。（沈阳风动工具厂磨工崔培）
    不该迁就落后
    装配工段个别工人干计件活时，总想找机会捞一把，说什么这个活大，那个活变型，非要给他补些工时，否则他就放下不干。段长听说工人放下不干，心里就担心，认为只要任务能交代就行，补给就补给吧。定额员若是不给，段长就找车间主任去解决，而主任不仅不予以批判，反而总是特别大方，要补就补。今年7月份有八台床鞍，既不是变型的，又不是公差大的，但到月末，段长硬要每台补付五个工，而且说是主任许可的。定额员没有办法，结果每台床鞍给了十八个点，合计一百四十四个点。类似这样迁就工人落后思想的事情经常有，希望工厂领导上加以教育和纠正。（沈阳第一机床厂五号车间逯京芳）
