Bumper Harvest After Famine Year
Shan Lieying

What has become of Chalin Township in Pingluo County, Guangxi, the place where people fled famine and starved to death last year? This is something I, who interviewed in this township last year, am eager to know, and something that those who care about the lives of farmers want to know.

Now, all the threshing grounds in the four agricultural cooperatives of Chalin Township are covered with golden, full grains of rice, emitting a delicate fragrance. The total output of early rice in the township this year has more than doubled that of last year (last year's early rice was 320,000 jin, this year's is 750,000 jin). The value of labor days in the four cooperatives has reached 50 cents. This is very gratifying compared to the 18 cents of last year.

Here, every time for breakfast or dinner, many cooperative members' homes can smell the fragrant new rice. People's rations have increased compared to last year. In addition to being able to receive rations until the late rice harvest, 80% of the cooperative members can also receive cash. The amount of grain retained in the four cooperatives has increased compared to last year. Moreover, the township will soon be able to deliver the public grain that should be handed over this first half of the year and the 70,000 jin of surplus grain planned to be sold to the state.

The bumper harvest has brought not only tens of thousands of baskets of golden rice to the agricultural cooperatives in Chalin Township, but more importantly, it has brought profound political influence to the people. People have a new understanding of agricultural cooperatives, the Party, and the government. Dissatisfaction has begun to dissipate; few people mention withdrawing from the cooperative or going it alone.

"One day I went to the fair, and an acquaintance from Jinshan Township stopped me and said, 'Want to buy a copy of the 'Withdrawal from Cooperative' form?'" Chen Jiacai, a member of Ma'anshan Cooperative in Chalin Township, told me. "I told that person that agricultural cooperatives are opening up more and more avenues, so why talk about withdrawing from the cooperative! It is right to put in effort and improve the cooperative!" Indeed, Chen Jiacai is no longer as alienated from the cooperative as he was last year. His family has three laborers. They worked more than 200 labor days this early season, and in the summer harvest pre-distribution, they received sufficient rations and more than 50 yuan in cash. He excitedly told me: "This summer harvest will be many times better than last year. We must not relax in the second half of the year's production. It would be great to have a full year of bumper harvest."

In the home of Li Dongying, a member of Chalin Cooperative, several female cooperative members and their production team leader were discussing how to use new rice straw to build cattle sheds after dinner one day when I walked in.

I had heard the story of Li Dongying from township cadres long ago. Last year, during the severe spring famine, she lost one son, and another son who was studying had to drop out of school due to financial difficulties. Li Dongying, who had lost her husband long ago and was known for her diligence, was disheartened with the agricultural cooperative. But things did not turn out as badly as she thought. From this spring until the summer harvest, the government distributed relief grain to her family, and the cooperative also helped her buy more than a dozen chickens to raise. The cooperative's production not only did not stop but became more and more prosperous. Li Dongying was greatly encouraged, and she regained the spirit of working hard from morning till night as before. By this pre-distribution, her family of three received rations for everyone, and her son was also able to return to school.

Zhai Yumei, a member of Ma'anshan Cooperative who had fled to other places last year, often said with a smile to the people who joked with him this time: "The cooperative is doing well, so why flee the famine!" His family's life this year is no worse than Li Dongying's.

In order to rush to plant late rice, almost all the cooperative members went to work. No matter how hot the weather was, they insisted on burning lime to prepare more fertilizer. This thriving atmosphere deeply moved me, especially when I recalled the bleak atmosphere I encountered when I interviewed here at this time last year, I was even more pleased for this township.

After a famine year, there is a bumper harvest year, and the state's assistance has played a huge role. Although numbers are not easy to read, I will still list a few.

After Chalin Township experienced famine and deaths last spring, the state took many measures to help the township develop production. Almost every one of the 417 cooperative members' households in the township received government living loans, relief funds, or relief grain. The lives of families who fled the famine or died from the disaster were quickly settled. In the first half of this year alone, 224 households received a total of more than 4,300 yuan in living loans, and 261 households received a total of about 1,000 yuan in relief funds (some also received loans). The township received a total of 61,600 jin of relief grain.

Of course, there are more reasons for being able to have a bumper harvest. The county and district party committees and the township party branch changed their leadership style and overcame subjectivism must be mentioned. For example, in early rice production, the cadres overcame subjectivism, listened to the opinions of the masses, and adopted planting techniques according to local conditions. The phenomenon of cadres taking rulers to the fields to measure specifications and rigidly stipulating dense planting of single plants and dryland seedling raising, as they did last year, no longer exists.

### 荒年之后  空前丰收

    荒年之后  空前丰收
    山烈英
    广西平乐县茶林乡，这个去年曾经发生过逃荒和饿死人事件的地方，今年到底变的怎样了？这不仅是去年曾来这个乡采访过的我想急于了解，也是一些关心农民生活的人所希望知道的。
    现在，茶林乡四个农业社的所有的晒谷坪上，都铺满了金黄色颗颗饱满放着清香的谷粒。全乡今年早稻的总产量达到了去年早稻的一倍多（去年早稻是三十二万斤，今年是七十五万斤）。四个社的劳动日值都达到了五角钱。这，和去年的一角八分钱相比，是非常令人高兴的事。
    在这里，每当早餐或晚餐，许多社员家里都可以闻到香喷喷的新米饭。人们的口粮比去年增加了，80％的社员除了能够得到吃到晚稻收割的口粮之外，还能分到现金，四个社的留粮量都比去年增加了。而且全乡不久就可以把今年上半年应交的公粮和打算卖给国家的七万斤余粮送给国家。
    丰收，它给茶林乡的农业社带来的不仅仅是上万箩金黄的稻谷，更重要的是它给人们带来了深刻的政治影响——人们对农业社，对党和政府有了新的认识，不满情绪开始消除；退社，单干，很少有人提了。
    “有一天我去赶闹子，金山乡的一个熟人拦住我说，‘退社书’，你不买一本？”茶林乡马安山社社员陈家才对我说，“我告诉那个人，农业社越干门路越多，还讲什么退社！出把力，把社搞好才对！”是的，陈家才再也不像去年那么对社离心离德了。他一家三个劳动力，今年早造他们干了两百多个劳动日，在夏收预分中分得了足够的口粮，还有五十多元现金。他兴奋地告诉我：“今年夏收不知要比去年好几倍，下半年的生产万不能放松，捞个全年丰收多好。”
    在茶林社社员李冬英家里，一天晚饭后，有好几个女社员和她们的生产队长议论着如何用新稻草盖牛栏，这当儿，我走了进来。
    关于李冬英的故事，我早就听乡干部讲过。去年，在严重的春荒中，她死去了一个儿子，另一个正在读书的儿子也因生活困难而辍学。早已死去丈夫、素以勤劳闻名的李冬英这时对农业社凉了半截。但事情并没有像她所想的那么糟，政府从今年春季一直到夏收，给她全家发放了救济粮，社里还帮她买了十几只鸡来养；社里的生产不但没有停顿，而且越搞越热火。李冬英受到了很大的鼓舞，她又恢复了从前那种起早贪黑下力劳动的劲头。到这次预分，她全家三口，每人都得到了口粮，儿子也可以复学了。
    去年曾经逃往外地的马鞍山社社员宅玉美，这次常常笑呵呵地和同他开玩笑的人们说：“社搞起来了，还逃什么荒！”今年他一家的生活并不次于李冬英。
    为了抢插晚稻，社员们几乎全部出工，不管天气怎么热，他们也坚持着烧石灰，准备更多的肥料。这种欣欣向荣的气象，使我深为激动，特别是当我回忆起去年此时我在这里采访时所遇到的不景气的气氛时，我就更加为这个乡庆贺了。
    荒年之后有空前丰收的年成，国家的扶助是起了巨大作用的。数字虽然不易逗人爱读，我还是列举几个。
    去年春季茶林乡发生了逃荒和死人的事情以后，国家采取了许多办法扶助这个乡发展生产。全乡四百一十七户社员中，几乎每户都得到了政府的生活贷款、救济款或救济粮。因灾逃荒或受灾死人的家庭的生活都很快的得到了安置。仅今年上半年，全乡就有二百二十四户得到了共四千三百多元的生活贷款，二百六十一户得到了共约一千元的救济款（其中也有兼得贷款的），全乡总共得到了六万一千六百斤救济粮。
    能够丰收，当然还有更多的原因，县、区党委和乡的党支部改变领导作风克服主观主义是要讲到的。比如，在早稻生产中，干部们克服了主观主义，听取群众意见，因地制宜采用种植技术，像去年那样干部拿尺子下田量规格、硬性规定单株密植和旱地育秧的现象已经没有了。 （原载广西日报）
