Xinhua News Agency, 26th. During the high tide of the rectification movement in forty state-owned factories and mines in the capital, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen Yun, Vice Chairmen of the CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary, and seventy-two members and alternate members of the Central Committee in Beijing, went separately to some factories and enterprises to view big-character posters and understand the situation of the rectification movement.

The leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee looked at the big-character posters put up by the workers very carefully.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the North China Radio Equipment Factory to view big-character posters. After viewing the big-character posters at the Shijingshan Power Plant, Liu Shaoqi had a long conversation with the leading cadres of the plant. He said that all the problems raised in the big-character posters that are correct should be corrected well. He encouraged the party committee secretary, factory director, chairman of the trade union, and secretary of the Communist Youth League of the plant to participate in physical labor in the future. He said: "Our country is a country led by the proletariat. To lead this country, we must have people from this class origin. Therefore, in the future, to be a cadre, one must not only have a certain level of education but must also be from the boiler room, workshop, or farming background."

Comrade Zhou Enlai successively viewed big-character posters at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and also visited the workers' canteen of the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. In separate conversations with the leading cadres of the two factories, Zhou Enlai inquired in detail about the wages, welfare, and organizational structure of the workers, and gave important instructions.

After viewing the big-character posters at the North China Radio Equipment Factory, Comrade Zhu De was very concerned about the education of young workers. He said to the party committee secretary of the factory: "We must explain the situation of our country clearly to the young workers and comrades; building socialism requires arduous struggle." Zhu De also went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and talked with the leading cadres of the plant.

Comrade Chen Yun viewed big-character posters at the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory. In his conversation with the leading cadres of the factory, he inquired in detail about the ratio of new and old workers in the factory, the workers' level of education, age, and background, as well as the factory's product quantity, quality, and cost.

Many members and alternate members of the Central Committee also inquired in detail from the party committee leaders of factories and mines about the rectification movement, as well as production management, workers' welfare, political and ideological education, and other aspects of work.

The Party Central Committee leaders going to factories to view big-character posters has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of workers in factories and mines to participate in the rectification movement.
