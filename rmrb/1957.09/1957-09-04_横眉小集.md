    The Cross-Eyed Miscellany
    Zhang Naiqi's "Right and Wrong"
    Piaoran
    Zhang Naiqi said: "First of all, we must distinguish between right and wrong," and "we must put distinguishing between right and wrong in the first place."

    Right and wrong should be distinguished. But what is Zhang Naiqi's right and wrong? He said: "Bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism"; "There is an essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class, but it cannot be said that there is an essential difference between the members of these two classes"; "We say that the current contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is not antagonistic, therefore, we cannot call fixed interest exploitation"; "Dogmatists lump things together without analysis, saying that the national bourgeoisie still has two sides after the public-private partnership of the entire industry, which is shocking to industrialists and businessmen"; "I was originally a leftist, but you insist on making me a rightist."

    What the bourgeoisie considers "right" is what the proletariat considers "wrong"; what the proletariat considers "right" is what the bourgeoisie considers "wrong." Zhang Naiqi beautifies the bourgeoisie, wants to prevent bourgeois elements from continuing to reform, and lays an ambush for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. He always thinks he is "right." But this is the "right" of the bourgeoisie, the "right" that opposes socialism. The more he distinguishes, the more Zhang Naiqi's "right" becomes isolated, and even progressive bourgeois elements come out to rebuke him. It is said:
    "Everyone is wrong but I alone am 'right,' the bourgeoisie still has a soul; the review 'has improved,' but the arrow is still attacking; alas, 'going one's own way,' who knows my suffering."
    Individual
    Huang Suqiu
    How people love the Party! Precisely because of this, they respect Party literary and art workers with thirty years of Party membership.

    But if we try to subtract from Feng Xuefeng's thirty years of Party membership the time he spent engaging in activities with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, the time he spent colluding with the Ding-Chen anti-Party group, and the time he spent engaging in independence and separation from the Party, all that remains is Feng Xuefeng himself, a gloomy and arrogant careerist.

    Gorky wrote in "The Destruction of the Individual":
    "The individual, if he relies solely on himself, if he places himself outside the relationships of the collective, outside the scope of any great ideas of the people, will become a lazy, conservative person, hostile to unity and the development of life." This can serve as a portrait of Feng Xuefeng.
    Books Cannot Be a Backer
    Sha Lei
    Ding Ling proclaimed to people: "As long as a person writes a book, no one can defeat him." In saying this, she truly revealed her "heart and soul." She wrote a book "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," and thought she was a celebrity, and could not be defeated, so she was secretly engaged in anti-Party group activities. Her wishful thinking was: if successful, she might usurp the leadership of the literary and art circles; if it failed, she would have "a book" anyway.

    Ding Ling, you are wrong! It is naturally good that you can write a book that is beneficial to the people, but what is your motivation for writing? It is for fear of being "defeated." How can "a book" be used as a talisman for doing all kinds of unspeakable things! Howard Fast has written more than "a book," and his reputation is much greater than yours. Once he betrayed the Party, he was "defeated" by the people!

    "A book" cannot be used as a backer to avoid being defeated.
    Fake Don Quixote
    Gu Yanling
    Sun Dayu, one of the key members of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Shanghai, shamelessly used "Don Quixote on the ideological front" to cover himself up after his ugly face was exposed.

    The real Don Quixote's foolishness was due to his own stupidity, while the fake Don Quixote was attempting to deceive his way through. However, the people may not even see through this little trick.

    The fake Don Quixote described the crime of falsely accusing a large number of Party cadres and progressive people of being "counter-revolutionaries" as being "loyal to the Party with all his heart" and "stubbornly clinging to 'foolish loyalty'." The meaning is actually very clear: he extremely hates our revolutionary cadres, he hopes that many of our excellent revolutionary cadres will go to Yuhuatai one by one, and then the workers and peasants of China will be trampled into the eighteenth level of hell! Upon closer inspection, the Party he is loyal to is not the Communist Party of the working class, but the Kuomintang of "Chiang's world, Chen's Party"!

    Even now, Sun Dayu is still acting crazy and selling foolishness on the one hand, and spitting blood on the other, viciously attacking the Party. If you really think that the fake Don Quixote's ugly and rogue behavior is only ridiculous and pitiful, then you are too naive.

    横眉小集
    章乃器的“是非”
    飘然
    章乃器说：“首先要明辨是非”，“要把明辨是非放在第一位”。
    是非是应明辨的。但章乃器的是非是什么？他说：“官僚主义比资本主义更危险”；
    “资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，但这两个阶级的分子，不能说有本质的区别”；
    “我们说资产阶级和工人阶级当前的矛盾不是对抗性的，因此，我们不能把定息说成剥削”；
    “教条主义者笼统地不加分析，说民族资产阶级在全行业公私合营后还有两面性，工商业家是惊心动魄的”；
    “我本是个左派，你们硬把我做右派”。
    资产阶级的“是”，无产阶级以为“非”；无产阶级的“是”，资产阶级以为“非”。章乃器美化资产阶级，要阻碍资产阶级分子继续改造，为资产阶级复辟打埋伏。他总以为他是“是”的。但这是资产阶级的“是”，是反对社会主义的“是”。越辨，章乃器的“是”越陷于孤立，连进步的资产阶级分子都出来斥责他了。论曰：
    “众人皆非我独‘是’，资产阶级犹有魂；检讨‘有所提高’，箭头仍是进攻；吁嗟‘独行其是’兮，谁知我的苦衷”。
    个人
    黄肃秋
    人们如何热爱党啊！正因为如此，才尊敬有着三十年党龄的党的文艺工作者。
    但是我们试着把冯雪峰的三十年党龄中除掉他与胡风反革命集团的活动时间，除掉他和丁、陈反党集团勾结的时间，除掉他同党闹独立、闹分裂的时间，就只剩下一个阴沉的、骄纵的野心家的冯雪峰自己了。
    高尔基在“个性的毁灭”中写道：
    “个人，如果单靠自己，如果置身于集体的关系之外，置身于任何民众的伟大思想的范围之外，就会变成怠惰的、保守的、团结与生活发展相敌对的人”。这正可以给冯雪峰作写照。
    书不能做靠山
    沙蕾
    丁玲向人宣传：“一个人只要写出一本书来，就谁也打他不倒。”她这样说，倒是真实地倾吐了她的“肺腑”的。她写了一本“太阳照在桑乾河上”，自以为是名人了，打她不倒了，便鬼鬼祟祟地在搞反党集团活动。她的如意算盘是：如果成功，可能篡夺到文艺界的领导权；如果失败，反正自己有了“一本书”。
    丁玲，你错了！你能写出一本对人民有益的书自然是好的，可是你的写作动机为什么，是为了怕被“打倒”。“一本书”哪能作为做一切见不得人的事的护身符啊！霍华特·法斯特不止写过“一本书”，他的名气也比你大得多，一旦他背叛了党，便给人民“打倒”了！
    “一本书”是不能作为不被打倒的靠山的。
    假唐·吉呵德
    顾延龄
    章罗联盟在上海骨干之一孙大雨，在他的丑恶面目被揭露之后，他还恬不知耻，以“思想战线上的唐·吉呵德”为自己掩护。
    真唐·吉呵德的做傻相是由于自己的愚蠢，而假唐·吉呵德却是企图蒙蔽过关而已。可是，人民未必连这点儿手法也看不出来。
    假唐·吉呵德把诬告大批党员干部和进步人士为“反革命”的罪行，说成是对党“赤胆忠诚”，“死抱着‘愚忠’不放”。意思其实很明白，他极端仇恨我们的革命干部，他指望我们许多优秀的革命干部一个一个走上雨花台，于是乎中国的工人和农民又被踏到十八层地狱里！揭开来看，原来他所效忠的党，不是工人阶级的共产党，而是“蒋家天下陈家党”的国民党！
    直到现在，孙大雨还一面装疯卖傻，一面血口喷人，恶毒的向党进攻。假唐·吉呵德的这种耍赖丑态，如果你当真只认为他可笑可怜，那就未免太天真了。
