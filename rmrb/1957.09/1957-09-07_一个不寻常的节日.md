    An Unusual Festival
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang

    August 20th is Hungary's "Constitution Day," which the workers call "Workers and Peasants' Solidarity Festival," and the farmers call "New Bread Festival." On this day, large-scale worker-peasant gatherings are held simultaneously in six regions across Hungary. Central leaders are dispatched to give reports and celebrate with the farmers. We followed a group of 800 people, including workers, led by comrades Dobi and Kádár, to Kisujszállás, a small city in Szolnok County, to participate in the celebration. A local agricultural exhibition was being held there.

        On the Train

    We took a special train eastward, along the vast plain of the Tisza River basin. The harvested wheat fields were dotted with stacks of golden wheat stalks, and some fields had already been plowed. The dark, fertile soil showed that this region not only has fertile soil but also a higher proportion of collectively managed agriculture than other places. Only corn and melons remained in the fields. This year, the corn planting area is particularly large, which portends a new development in animal husbandry next year.

    The train stopped for a few minutes in Szolnok. Some residents spontaneously gathered at the station to welcome their leaders, and a military band played welcoming music on the platform. Comrade Kádár was chatting and joking with the workers of "Angel Land," whom he knew well, when he suddenly saw us. "Are you also representatives of Angel Land?" I said, "Yes, I have an old friendship with the comrades of Angel Land. During the difficult days last year, I visited them and participated in their party building meetings." "Oh, I see!" Before he could finish speaking, someone pulled him to the window. Comrade Kádár did not get off the train but waved to the people outside the window. It is said that the residents here had been flocking to the meeting place since early morning like a tide.

    I asked Comrade Kádár, "Is this the second time you have come to Szolnok since last November?" He said, "Yes." Everyone talked with emotion about the tremendous changes that had taken place in Hungary from November 4th of last year to today. Comrade Kádár said, "Our country and people are more consolidated and united than they were a year ago." An elderly worker looked at Kádár with a smiling face and said, "János, do you know that the same changes have taken place in my family? Last year, my son and I almost broke off relations over the evaluation of the October events. My wife even shed tears over the family disputes! In recent months, my son has changed. The changes in the overall situation and the influence of objective truth have sobered up the young man who had been carried away. He has become closer to me and now calls me 'Óbuka' (Dear Dad) again." Comrade Kádár also told a friend about a similar situation that had occurred in his family, but he added that parents also have a responsibility!

    Comrade Kádár walked from one carriage to another, chatting with the worker representatives from various districts of Budapest, telling jokes. He and the workers from the Csepel district recalled a negotiation with the Budapest Central Workers' Council last December. Comrade Kádár said with a smile, "That 22-year-old counter-revolutionary rogue chairman named Rácz slammed the table at me and threatened, 'I represent nine million Hungarians, and I demand that Maléter and Nagy return to the leadership of the government!' How arrogant!" Everyone laughed after hearing this. Of course, it sounds like a joke now, but at that time, this arrogant atmosphere of counter-revolution weighed heavily on the skies of Budapest, as difficult to dispel as today's dense fog.

        A Farmer's Festival

    After another half hour east from Szolnok, our train arrived in Kisujszállás, where the famous Hungarian novelist Móricz spent his student days. Two days ago, a dedication ceremony for Móricz's commemorative statue was held here.

    We quickly walked from the station to the venue. On the large lawn surrounded by white birch forests, tens of thousands of people had gathered like a sea of people. Groups of people continued to pour in from all directions, and eventually, it seemed that even the surrounding birch forest could not hold them back and was submerged by the crowd. Today's scene immediately reminded people of the "May Day" celebration in the capital this year. It is estimated that no fewer than 100,000 people participated in today's event, while the original residents of this small city numbered only 16,000. They had been busy for several days and nights preparing for today's celebration but finally completed the amazing organizational work excellently.

    Farmers from the Tisza River basin were gathered here, wearing costumes characteristic of the plains, especially the attire of the horse herders, which attracted the most attention. The residents of this area are said to be brave and good riders and are known as having iron heads. Their faces revealed a generous and hospitable smile, and they were also curiously looking at the young guests from India and Africa who had just come to Hungary from Moscow.

    The conference began promptly at ten o'clock. When the Szolnok County Congress representative announced that a Soviet agricultural delegation and the Soviet ambassador were participating in today's conference, the whole audience responded with cheers for the eternal friendship between Hungary and the Soviet Union. The speeches by the worker representatives from Budapest and Comrades Dobi and Kádár all highly praised the farmers of the whole country, especially those of the eastern region. The farmers in the eastern region of Hungary suffered the deepest feudal oppression in the past, so they have always been politically more advanced. They have a long historical tradition in the struggle for freedom and liberation. The most famous peasant uprising in 1514, and the numerous revolutionary movements in 1848, 1919, and 1945, all originated in the eastern region. The heroic deeds of the farmers in these regions are deeply reflected in the poems and novels of Petőfi, Móricz, and Illés ("The Tisza is Burning" author). It was no accident that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government was established in Szolnok on November 4, 1956.

    Chairman Dobi said at the conference, "The farmers of the Tisza River basin were the first to come to the Parliament Building from other places to ask me for weapons to participate in the struggle to crush the counter-revolution and restore order." Therefore, during the counter-revolutionary period in October last year, it was difficult for the enemy to mobilize this region. Imperialism once fantasized about splitting Hungary into East and West Hungary, precisely because it estimated that it would be difficult for its pig's snout to reach into this eastern garden.

    Comrade Kádár said, "Most of the production cooperatives stood firm during the counter-revolutionary offensive. They have taken root for socialism in the Hungarian countryside, and no one can destroy them anymore." Then, the farmers of the Tisza River basin will also play a pioneering and exemplary role in the new upsurge of national agricultural development in the future. Szolnok County is the center of the progressive forces in this region, and it is said that agricultural collectivization in this county has reached 50%-60% (other regions account for about 13%).

    This year, the state grain purchase is another new test for the farmers. The government did not take any administrative measures but instead used commodity exchange. The four eastern states have taken the lead in overfulfilling the plan for the third quarter, and Szolnok County is the first among them.

    Comrades Dobi and Kádár talked to the farmers about the current situation in various aspects of the country, which is trending towards improvement, and the direction of common efforts in the future, and clearly explained some issues that the farmers are concerned about. They told the farmers that the requisition system would not be restored, but the correct price policy must be adopted to ensure the balance of economic development. The socialist modernization of agricultural production is the direction of the farmers' efforts and the only path of development. Therefore, the state will give agriculture more investment in the future three-year plan. First of all, more small machines and fertilizers should be produced for production cooperatives and individual farmers, and at the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the basic production equipment of production cooperatives increases by 50%. In the next three years, national agricultural production will be increased by 12%.

    Kádár also called on the farmers to strengthen internal unity, and the members should get along friendly with the members who withdrew from the society and the individual farmers, and help each other progress. Finally, when the United Nations Five-Member Committee talked about slander and intervention in Hungary, there was an outcry of protest in the venue.

    This kind of cordial and simple conversation between the party and state leaders was very agreeable to the farmers. They listened, smiled, and shouted attentively from beginning to end, standing for three full hours, like a solidified whole. What kind of power is it that dominates the villagers to voluntarily abide by this order of the venue? It is nothing else but love for the motherland, love for socialism, and love for the leaders.

    Before the conference ended, the farmers and local representatives brought out newly melted large loaves of bread, carrying wine barrels and baskets full of fresh fruit, hand-woven carpets, potted flowers cultivated by housewives, etc., and lined up in long queues to go to the platform to present gifts to the party, government, employee representatives and foreign envoys. Finally, the conference closed in the passionate and solemn strains of the Internationale.

    A conference of this scale has not been held since 1948. (Attached picture)

    一个不寻常的节日
    本报记者　胡济邦
    8月20日是匈牙利的“宪法节”，工人们把它称为“工农联欢节”，农民们又叫它为“新面包节”。这一天，在匈牙利全国六个地区都同时举行大规模的工农联欢大会，中央分派负责同志下去作报告并和农民们联欢。我们是随着道比和卡达尔等同志带领的包括工人在内的一支八百人的队伍，到索尔诺克州的一个小城基苏萨拉什参加庆祝大会的，那里正在举办一个地方性的农业展览会。
        在列车上
    我们乘着一列专车向东驶去，沿途是蒂萨河流域的一片大平原，收割以后的麦田上有的堆垒着一堆堆金黄色的麦秆，有的麦田已经翻耕。从一片片黑油油的土地上，可以看出这个地区不仅土壤肥沃，集体经营的农业比重也高过其他地方。田间作物现在只剩下玉米和瓜果。今年玉米播种面积特别多，这预示着明年的养畜业将有新的发展。
    列车经过索尔诺克时，曾停留几分钟。有些居民自发地聚集在车站上来欢迎他们的领袖，一支军乐队在站台上奏着欢迎的乐曲。卡达尔同志正在和他最熟悉的“安琪儿地”的职工们说笑谈天，一转眼忽然看见我们，“你们也是安琪儿地的代表吗？”我说：“是呀，我和安琪儿地的同志也有老交情，在去年的困难日子里，我访问过他们，参加过他们建党时的会议。”“噢，原来如此！”话没说完，有人拉他转向窗外，卡达尔同志没有下车，向窗外招手致意。据说，这里的居民从一清早起就像潮水一般向今天开会的地方涌去。
    我又问卡达尔同志：“这是去年11月以来第二次来到索尔诺克吗？”他说：“是的。”大家都感叹地谈论着从去年11月4日到今天匈牙利发生的巨大变化。卡达尔同志说：“我们的国家和人民比过去一年更加巩固和团结了。”一位年长的工人带着微笑的脸看着卡达尔说：“亚诺什，你知道我们家也发生了同样的变化吗？去年我和我的儿子为了对十月事件的估价几乎吵翻了脸。我的妻子为了家庭的纠纷还流过老泪哩！近几个月来我的儿子改变了，整个形势的变化，客观真理的影响使热昏了的年轻人的头脑清醒过来了。对我已亲近起来，现在又叫我‘奥布卡’（亲爱的爸爸）了。”卡达尔同志还告诉了他的一个朋友家中所发生的类似情况，但他补充一句说，父母也有责任呀！
    卡达尔同志从一个车厢走到另一个车厢，一路上和布达佩斯各区的职工代表们谈谈家常，说说笑话。他和切佩尔区的职工们回忆起去年12月和布达佩斯中央工人委员会的一次谈判的情况。卡达尔同志微笑地说：“那位二十二岁的反革命流氓主席名叫拉奇，当时对我拍着桌子威胁说：‘我代表九百万匈牙利人，我要求让马勒特和纳吉回到政府的领导岗位！’你们看，这是何等狂妄！”大家听完了都哈哈大笑。当然，现在听起来像是一个笑话，但在当时，这种反革命嚣张的气氛却沉重地压在布达佩斯的上空，像今天的浓雾一般消散不了。
        农民的盛会
    从索尔诺克再东行半小时，我们的列车到达了基苏萨拉什，这里是匈牙利著名小说家莫里兹少年时代求学的地方，两天以前，这里刚举行过莫里兹纪念像落成典礼。
    我们从车站很快地走到会场。在四面围着小白桦林的大草坪上已聚集了成千上万的群众就像一片人海。一群一群的人仍不断地从四面八方涌来，最后似乎周围的白桦林也拦阻不住，被人群淹没了。今天的这个场面马上令人联想到今年首都的“五一节”。据估计，参加今天这个盛会的不下十万人，而这个小城原来的居民却只有一万六千人，为了准备今天的盛会，他们已忙了几个昼夜，但终于还是出色地完成了令人惊奇的组织工作。
    这里聚集着蒂萨河流域的农民，他们穿着带有平原特色的服装，尤其是那些放马人的装束最吸引着人们的注意。这个地区的居民，据说英勇善骑，有勇敢的铁头之称。他们的脸上流露着一种豪放好客的笑容，他们也在好奇地看着来宾台上那些刚从莫斯科来匈牙利访问的印度和非洲的青年客人。
    大会在十点钟准时开始。当索尔诺克州会议代表宣布有苏联农业代表团和苏联大使参加今天的大会时，全场报以匈苏友谊万岁的欢呼。布达佩斯的工人代表、道比和卡达尔同志的讲话都一致对全国农民，特别是东部地区的农民作了很高的评价。匈牙利东部地区的农民过去受到封建压迫最深，因此在政治上一向比较先进。他们在自由解放斗争中有着悠久的历史传统，1514年最著名的一次农民起义，1848、1919、1945年的多次革命运动，都是在东部地区发源的。这些地区农民的英勇斗争的事迹在裴多菲、莫里兹和伊雷什（“蒂萨河在燃烧”的作者）等人的诗篇和小说中得到深刻的反映。1956年11月4日匈牙利工农革命政府在索尔诺克宣布成立也不是偶然的事情。
    道比主席在大会上说：“蒂萨河流域的农民们是最先从外地来到国会大厦找我要武器，要参加粉碎反革命的斗争和恢复秩序的。”因此，在去年10月反革命时期，敌人很难发动这个地区。帝国主义曾幻想把匈牙利分裂为东西匈牙利，也就是因为估计到自己的猪鼻子很难伸进这个东部的花园里。
    卡达尔同志说：“大部分生产合作社在反革命进攻时站稳了立场，它们在匈牙利的乡村里已经扎下社会主义的根，任何人再也不能把它们摧毁。”那末蒂萨河流域的农民在今后全国农业发展的新高潮中也会起着先锋模范的作用。索尔诺克州又是这个地区进步力量的中心，据说这个州的农业合作化已达50％—60％（其他地区约占13％）。
    今年国家粮食收购对农民又是一个新的考验，政府没有采取任何行政手段，而是通过商品交换。东部四个州已领先超额完成第三季度的计划，索尔诺克州又是它们之中的第一名。
    道比、卡达尔同志和农民们谈了国家当前各方面都趋向好转的情况和今后应共同努力的方向，明确地交代了农民所关心的一些问题。他们告诉农民说，征购制不恢复，但必须采取正确的物价政策以保证经济发展的平衡。农业的社会主义现代化生产是农民努力的方向，也是唯一的发展道路，因此国家在未来的三年计划中将给农业更多的投资。首先为生产合作社和个体农民多生产小型机器和肥料，同时要保证生产合作社的生产基本设备增加50％。在未来的三年内，要使全国农业生产增加12％。
    卡达尔并号召农民加强内部团结，社员要和退社农民、个体农民之间友好相处，互助进步。最后谈到联合国五人委员会对匈牙利的诽谤和干涉时，会场上发出了一片抗议呼声。
    党和国家领导同志的这种亲切而朴质的谈话很合农民们的心意，他们从头到尾一直用心地听着、笑着、喊着，足足站立了三个小时，像凝固了的一个整体。这是一种什么力量支配着老乡们自愿遵守会场的这种秩序呢？不是别的，就是对祖国的爱，对社会主义的爱，对领袖的爱。
    大会结束之前，农民们和当地各界代表端出新熔制的大面包，提着酒桶和装满鲜果的篮筐，自己编织的地毯，主妇培植的盆花等等，排着长队走上主席台向党、政、职工代表们和外国使节们献礼。最后大会在激昂而庄严的国际歌声中闭幕了。
    像今天这样规模的大会自1948年以后还是第一次。（附图片）
