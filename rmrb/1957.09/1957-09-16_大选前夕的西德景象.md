The noisy and lively West German election farce, complete with both civil and military performances, is coming to an end today. This farce, which officially began in May this year, has been running for four months. During this period, the leaders of the various parties, who have been traveling back and forth between the constituencies, have returned to Bonn one after another, covered in dust, anxiously awaiting the results of the voters' vote tomorrow.

The main opponents in this election are the two major parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, which are basically evenly matched. The Christian Democratic Union's campaign slogan is "Guaranteeing Prosperity for Everyone." In its campaign propaganda, it has tried its best to tout the "achievements" of the Adenauer government's eight years in power (the so-called "economic miracle") and its "policy of strength." It also tries to incite anti-Soviet and anti-communist revanchist sentiments, and promotes the North Atlantic Alliance. The Social Democratic Party's campaign slogan is "Security for All," "No Atomic Bombs." Its propaganda focuses on foreign policy, advocating the establishment of a pan-European security system to replace hostile military blocs, and the establishment of diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with all countries. In addition, the Free Democratic Party, appearing as a third force, proposes the slogan: opposition to either of the two major parties governing alone.

The illegally banned German Communist Party announced its election program, calling on German Communist Party members, trade union members, and all its supporters to vote for the Social Democratic Party to defeat the Adenauer party and achieve the peaceful reunification of the two Germanys.

Regarding which of the two major parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, will win in the election on the 15th, observers here have various predictions. It is generally agreed that, judging from the balance of power between the two sides, neither of them is likely to win an overwhelming majority. The Social Democratic Party will receive more votes than in 1953, and even if the Christian Democratic Union wins a majority of the votes due to its various anti-democratic campaign tactics, it will no longer be able to have the absolute advantage it had in the Federal Parliament in the past.

In Bonn, the capital of West Germany, on the eve of the general election, it has been raining continuously for days, and the temperature has dropped below 15 degrees Celsius. The Rhine River is shrouded in fog, and the streets are deserted. Like other large and small cities in West Germany, although campaign advertisements of various parties are posted everywhere, and newspapers, radio, and television are filled with campaign propaganda, the general residents obviously lack enthusiasm for the election. On the streets and in public places, almost no one can be seen talking about the election. Even the propaganda planes soaring in the air with campaign slogans attached do not arouse people's interest.

The Hamburg "Die Welt" wrote: "The lively atmosphere of the election is entirely created by the planners who preside over the election affairs of the various parties. The reason why the election atmosphere is so lively is not because the political opposition is too great, but because the political opposition is too small."

From the statistical materials on the social composition of the previous Federal Parliament members, it can be seen that workers, who account for 45% of West German residents, only occupy 1.57% of the seats in the parliament, while entrepreneurs and financial capitalists, who only account for 1.5% of the residents, own 75% of the seats in the parliament. People here believe that no matter which party wins, the result of the West German general election on September 15 will not bring about a fundamental change in the social composition of the Federal Parliament members and in domestic and foreign policies.

### 大选前夕的西德景象

　　大选前夕的西德景象
　　新华社记者  刘桂梁
    锣鼓喧天、热闹非常的西德竞选闹剧今天已经到尾声。这一场文武兼备的闹剧从今年5月正式开演以来，连续演出了四个月之久。在这期间，奔波于各选区间的各政党领袖们今天风尘仆仆地陆续回到了波恩，紧张地盼待着明天选民们投票的结果。
    这次竞选的主要对手是基本上势均力敌的两个大党——基督教民主联盟和社会民主党。基督教民主联盟的竞选口号是
  “保障每个人的富裕”，在竞选宣传中它竭力吹嘘阿登纳政府执政八年来的“功绩”（所谓“经济繁荣奇迹”）和他的“实力政策”，并力图煽动反苏反共的复仇主义情绪，鼓吹北大西洋联盟。社会民主党的竞选口号是“给一切人以安全”，“不要原子弹”，它的宣传重点在于外交政策，它主张建立全欧安全体系来代替敌对的军事集团，同一切国家建立外交、经济、文化关系。此外，以第三种力量姿态出现的自由民主党提出的口号是：反对两个大党中的任何一个单独执政。
    被非法禁止的德国共产党宣布的竞选纲领，号召德国共产党党员、工会会员和它的一切拥护者，投社会民主党的票以击败阿登纳党，实现两个德国的和平统一。
    对于基督教民主联盟和社会民主党这两个大党的那一个将在15日的选举中获胜，这里的观察家们有着各种各样的预测。普遍肯定的是，从双方的力量对比来看，两者中的任何一个都不可能获得压倒的多数。社会民主党获得的选票将比1953年增多，而基督教民主联盟即使由于它的种种反民主竞选手段而获得多数的选票，也再不可能像过去那样拥有它在联邦议院中的绝对优势了。
    在大选前夕的西德首都波恩，连日霪雨，气温降到摄氏十五度以下。莱因河畔弥漫着烟雾，街道上冷清清的。像西德的其他大小城市一样，尽管到处张贴着各政党形形色色的大幅竞选广告，报纸、广播、电视挤满了关于竞选的宣传，一般居民显然对选举缺乏热情。在街道上，在公共场所里，几乎完全看不到任何人谈论有关选举的事。系着竞选标语在半空翱翔的宣传飞机也引不起人们的兴趣。
    汉堡“世界报”写道：“竞选的热闹气氛全是由各政党主持竞选事务的策划者们制造出来的。竞选气氛热烈的原因不是由于政治上的对立太大，而是由于政治上的对立太小。”
    从上届联邦议员的社会成份统计材料中可以看出，占西德居民45％的工人在议会中只有1.57％的席位，而只占居民1.5％的企业家和金融资本家却在议会中拥有75％的席位。这里的人们相信，不论是那一个党获胜，9月15日西德大选的结果不会带来联邦议院议员的社会组成和对内对外政策的根本改变。    （据新华社波恩15日电）
