Why Only Want Laws, Not Policies?
Xu Ping, Vice President of the Central School for Political and Legal Cadres

On the issue of the Party's policies and national laws, right-wing elements clamor for everything to be "rule of law," demanding that all the Party's policies must be submitted to the National People's Congress to be made into laws, that the Party cannot directly issue orders to the people, nor can it issue instructions to Party members outside of the law. Their saying is "policy cannot replace law," which means they only want laws and not policies.

Why do these people raise this question? What is the essence of their thinking and their political purpose?

Let us first look at whether all of the Party's policies must and can be made into laws. As everyone knows, law is not something abstract; it is the concretization and codification of the ruling class's policies, and one of the important tools for implementing those policies. The Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to transforming its policies into laws through the state power, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Even before the founding of the nation, the Party's basic policies at the time were embodied in the Common Program, which was formulated through consultation between the Communist Party and various democratic parties, and was accepted by the Central People's Government after the founding of the nation as its governing principle. In 1954, the Party's general line and general policy during the transition period were embodied in the nation's fundamental law—the Constitution. In recent years, the Party has also transformed its policies in various fields into many laws and decrees through the state power organs. Of course, from the current point of view, our laws are not yet complete, and must be gradually and systematically formulated according to needs. However, not all of the Party's policies must and can be made into laws. Anyone with a little political and legal common sense, and who is not a believer in the omnipotence of law, will know this. Moreover, our country is in a period of profound change. If all policies are prematurely fixed in legal form, it will not only fail to promote the consolidation and development of the economic base, but will also hinder social progress. It is not difficult to imagine that if a civil law had been formulated before the socialist transformation was completed, it would not have been able to fully reflect the socialist economic relations, and would therefore have become an obstacle to the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. If a criminal law had been formulated before the storm of revolution had passed, it would not have been able to fully reflect the development and changes in the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the contradictions among the people, and therefore it might have been biased in determining crimes and punishments, failing to meet the needs of the development of the revolutionary situation.

Our laws are fundamentally different from those of the bourgeoisie. They represent the interests of all the working people, so they can never be written by concentrating some so-called experts in a room, as the right-wing elements say. We first embody the will of the working people in the Party's policies, and after practical testing, we summarize and elevate them into laws. This formula of policy—practice—law is the application of Marxist-Leninist epistemology to legislative work, and it has been fully confirmed by the Party and the people's rich revolutionary practice over the years. Therefore, we say that laws can only be gradually perfected, and when laws cannot yet be perfected, we must rely on policies to handle affairs. At the same time, even with laws, in order to adapt to the complex and ever-changing circumstances of our country's class relations and social life, there must be corresponding policies in order to better implement the laws. It is not difficult to understand that without such clear policies and mechanically implementing the laws, how could our past campaigns to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and the anti-Party clique campaign in the previous period have achieved the great achievements of punishing the few and educating the majority, and ensuring the healthy development of the movements?

Now let us look at whether the Party can directly issue orders to the people. This question must be analyzed. We Marxists believe that the Communist Party is different from all other political parties. It is the natural and true representative of the interests and will of the broad masses of the people, and it serves the people wholeheartedly. When it works among the working people, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must adopt democratic methods of persuasion and education, and absolutely not adopt commandist attitudes and coercive methods." In this sense, the Party does not need and should not stand above the people to issue orders, and the Party has always emphasized the mass line and consistently opposed commandism. However, the Party occupies a leading position in national work, and it has the responsibility to promptly put forward its own views and policies on some major issues, in order to organize and guide the people to action. In recent years, the Party has called on the people to rise up and overthrow the rule of the three great enemies, called on the people to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, reform the land system, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and carry out the three major transformations; the Party has also called on the people to increase production, carry out savings, and carry out socialist construction. These calls take the form of resolutions, programs, instructions, etc., some of which are issued by the Party Central Committee alone, some of which are jointly issued with various democratic parties, and some of which are jointly issued with the government. Facts have proved that, precisely because of this, the Party can directly and promptly put forward its policies to the people and be accepted and mastered by the people, which has greatly encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the people, and thus more effectively guaranteed the correct implementation of the country's policies and laws. In this sense, what is wrong with directly issuing orders to the people?

Even more absurd is that the right-wing elements propose that "the Party should not directly command the Party members in the national administrative system," and that "the Party should not issue internal instructions to Party members outside of laws and decrees," otherwise it will "mess up the national administrative system." As everyone knows: our Party issues instructions to its Party members and Party groups in state organs in order to implement the Party's policies and resolutions, strengthen unity with non-Party cadres, strengthen ties with the masses, consolidate Party and state discipline, and fight against bureaucracy. By doing so, the Party is strengthening the work of the national administrative system and ensuring the concrete and effective implementation of national laws and decrees. May I ask, how can the Party, as the core of national leadership, not issue some necessary instructions to its Party members and Party groups in state organs? May I ask, how will this mess up the national administrative system?

In summary, the relationship between policy and law is both close and inseparable, and the Party must use its policies to guide the actions of the people and Party members, so why do right-wing elements make such a big deal about only wanting laws and not policies? The problem is obvious. The right-wing elements use the bourgeoisie's hypocritical democracy and rule of law to confuse and incite those who are naive, ignorant, and muddled in their thinking, and attack the Party. Because, since policy cannot replace law, then all of the Party's policies that have not been embodied in law become "illegal private goods," and the Party will not be able to use them to guide the country's political life in the future; since the Party cannot directly issue orders to the masses, then the Party's policies cannot meet the masses, which actually cuts off the Party's ties with the broad masses of the people; since the Party cannot issue instructions to Party members outside of the law, then this cuts off the Party's political ties with Party members, thus weakening and even abolishing the Party's core leadership role in the work of state organs. In this way, the Party becomes abstract, and the Party's organizational structure, which constantly studies policies and manages Party members, can naturally be abolished. Haven't the right-wing elements already openly proposed such absurdities as "changing the various departments within the Communist Party into various committees in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress" and "political design institutes"? This is their so-called "rule of law" and the "political design" they have drafted under the smoke screen of "policy cannot replace law," attempting to usurp the Party's leadership over the country! This is the ideological essence and political purpose of why they only want laws and not policies.

### 为什么只要法律不要政策？

　　为什么只要法律不要政策？
　　中央政法干部学校副校长　徐平
    在党的政策和国家法律的问题上，右派分子叫嚷一切要“法治”，党的政策都必须提到人民代表大会制成法律，党不能直接向人民群众发号施令，也不能在法律之外向党员发布指示，他们的说法是“不能以政策代法律”，这就是说，只要法律不要政策。
    这些人为什么提出这问题？他们的思想实质和政治目的又是什么呢？
    现在我们首先来看，党的政策是否都必须和可能制成法律呢？大家知道，法律不是什么抽象的东西，它是统治阶级底政策的具体化和条文化，是实现政策的重要工具之一。中国共产党从来是十分重视将自己的政策通过政权制成法律，来巩固人民民主专政。还在开国前夕，党在当时的各项基本政策就体现为共产党和各民主党派所协商制定的共同纲领，并为建国后的中央人民政府所接受作为它的施政方针。在1954年，党在过渡时期的总路线总政策，又体现为国家的根本大法——宪法。几年来，党还通过国家权力机关将自己的各方面的政策制成了许多法律法令。当然，从现在来看，我们的法律还不够完备，必须根据需要，逐步地系统地加以制定。但是，党的一切政策并不是都必须和可能制成法律的。只要稍有政治法律常识而不是迷信法律万能的人，都会知道这一点的。何况我国处在一个深刻的变革时期，如果把一切政策过早地用法律形式固定下来，那就不仅不会促进经济基础的巩固和发展，反而会妨碍社会的前进。不难设想，假使在社会主义改造没有完成以前就制定民法，那它就不可能充分反映社会主义的经济关系，因而也就会成为农业、手工业和资本主义工商业改造的障碍。如果在革命的风暴时期没有过去以前就制定刑法，那它就不可能充分反映敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾发展变化的情况，因而在罪与刑的确定上就有可能失之偏颇，不符合革命形势发展的需要。
    我们的法律与资产阶级的法律根本不同，它是代表着全体劳动人民的利益的，所以它绝不能像右派分子所说的，集中一些所谓专家坐在屋子里就可以写出来的。我们是首先把劳动人民的意志体现为党的政策，经过实践的检验，然后总结上升为法律。这个政策——实践——法律的公式，是马克思列宁主义认识论应用在立法工作上的规律，也是党和人民多年来丰富的革命实践所完全证实了的。所以我们说，法律只能是逐步地完备，而在法律还不能完备的时候，我们就必须依靠政策办事。同时，即使有了法律，为了适应我国阶级关系和社会生活千变万化的复杂情况，还必须要有相应的政策才能更好地贯彻执行法律。不难懂得，如果没有这样明确的政策而机械地执行法律，那么我们过去进行的镇反、“三反”、“五反”以及前一时期的肃反运动，怎能达到惩办少数、教育多数，而使运动健康发展获得巨大的成就呢？
    现在我们再来看，党究竟可以不可以直接向人民群众发号施令？对这个问题必须要有分析。我们马克思主义者认为，共产党不同于其他一切政党，它是天然的广大人民利益和意志的真正代表者，它是全心全意为人民群众服务的；它在劳动人民中间进行工作的时候，正如毛主席所指出的：“必须采取民主的说服教育的方法，绝不允许采取命令主义态度和强制手段”。从这一意义上讲，党不需要也不应该站在人民群众之上来发号施令，而党从来也就是强调走群众路线的，一贯反对命令主义的。但是，党在国家工作中居于领导的地位，它有责任在一些大的问题上，及时地提出自己的主张和方针政策，来组织和指导人民群众行动起来。几年来，党曾号召人民群众起来推翻三大敌人的统治，号召人民群众起来抗美援朝、改革土地制度、镇压反革命、进行三大改造；党也曾号召人民群众起来增加生产，开展节约，进行社会主义建设。这些号召采取决议、纲领、指示等形式，有的是党中央单独发布的，有的是与各民主党派联合发布的，有的是与政府联合发布的。事实证明，正因为这样，党能以直接地、及时地将自己的政策向人民群众提出并为人民群众所接受和掌握，就大大地鼓舞了人民群众的革命热情和生产积极性，这样也就更有效地保障国家的施政方针和法律法令的正确贯彻执行。从这个意义上讲，所谓直接向人民群众发号施令又有什么不可以呢？
    更荒谬的是，右派分子提出：“党不要直接指挥国家行政系统的党员”，“党对党员不应该在法律法令之外再发内部指示”，否则就会“搞乱了国家行政系统”。众所周知：我们的党向自己的党员和国家机关中的党组发布指示，是为了实现党的政策和决议，加强同非党干部的团结，密切同群众的联系，巩固党和国家的纪律，同官僚主义作斗争。党这样作，正是加强国家行政系统的工作，保证国家的法律法令具体地有效地贯彻执行。试问，作为国家领导核心的党怎么可以不向自己的党员和国家机关中的党组发布一些必要的指示呢？试问，这怎么就会把国家行政系统搞乱了呢？
    综上所述，政策与法律的关系既是密切地不可分割，党又必须以自己的政策来指导人民群众和党员的行动，那么为什么右派分子却大做其只要法律不要政策的文章呢？问题很明显，右派分子是以资产阶级虚伪的民主和法治来迷惑和煽动那些幼稚无知和思想糊涂的人们，向党进攻。因为，既然政策不能代替法律，那么，还没有体现为法律的党的政策就都成为“非法的私货”了，那党在今后就不能据此以指导国家的政治生活了；既然党不能直接向群众发号施令，那么，党的政策不能与群众见面，这实际上就割断了党同广大人民群众的联系；既然党在法律之外不能向党员发布指示，那么，这就割断了党同党员在政治上的联系，因而实际上就削弱了以至取消了党在国家机关工作中的核心领导作用。这样一来，党就成为抽象的了，作为经常研究政策和管理党员的党的组织机构，自然可以取消了。不是右派分子早已公开提出“把共产党内各部改为全国人民代表大会常务委员会里的各种委员会”和“政治设计院”等等谰言吗？这就是他们所谓“法治”和在“不能以政策代法律”的烟幕下，草拟的企图篡夺党对国家的领导的“政治设计”！这也就是他们为什么只要法律不要政策的思想实质和政治目的。
