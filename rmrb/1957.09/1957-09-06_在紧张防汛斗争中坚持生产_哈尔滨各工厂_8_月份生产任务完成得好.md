Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 5th. Workers in Harbin factories successfully completed their August production tasks despite the intense flood control efforts.

The Harbin Cement Plant, already surrounded by floodwaters, maintained production while its entire staff worked to protect the factory. They exceeded their August production quota by 102 tons of cement. The Harbin Woolen Mill, located right next to the river, had 800 employees participating in flood control efforts every day. Older and weaker employees who couldn't go to the dikes stayed behind and maintained production, ensuring the August production targets were met.

Factory workers devised various methods to ensure that both flood control and production proceeded without hindrance. Before leaving for flood control duty, workers at the Harbin Bearing Factory voluntarily persisted in production. Workers who went to repair the dikes in the afternoon would arrive at the workshop early in the morning, with many exceeding their half-day production quotas by 100%. In August, the factory increased production by more than 15,000 sets of bearings. Workers at the Harbin Wire Factory generally exceeded their quotas by 10% due to the launch of inter-trade competitions. Workers Wu Jingran and Sun Yuying increased machine efficiency through better cooperation, producing an additional 900 meters of rubber wire per shift.

    在紧张防汛斗争中坚持生产
    哈尔滨各工厂8月份生产任务完成得好
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　哈尔滨各工厂职工在紧张的防汛斗争中，8月份的生产任务仍然完成得很好。
    已为洪水包围的哈尔滨水泥厂，全厂职工在全力保卫工厂的同时，坚持了生产，8月份超计划多生产了一百零二吨水泥。紧靠江边的哈尔滨毛织厂，每天有八百名职工参加防汛斗争。一些不能上堤的老弱职工留下来坚持生产，也保证了8月份生产任务的完成。
    各工厂职工想出各种办法做到防汛、生产两不误。哈尔滨轴承厂职工在出发防汛之前，都主动坚持生产，下午去修堤的职工清晨就到车间干活，很多人都超额一倍完成半天的生产计划。8月份这个厂增产轴承一万五千多套。哈尔滨电线厂职工，由于展开了同工种竞赛，普遍突破定额10％。工人武敬然和孙玉英加强配合后，提高了机器效率，每班多产橡皮线九百公尺。
