    "Golden Face Qilan" New Tea Variety
    Recently, a rare new tea variety, "Golden Face Qilan," has been discovered on the tea mountains in Jiufeng and Huangtian areas of Pinghe County, Fujian Province. This tea has a heavy body, thick leaves, can be steeped many times, and has a golden and shiny color and fragrant aroma after brewing. In addition to the advantages of ordinary famous teas, it also has the special effect of treating early-stage depression and high fever.
    Currently, the quantity of this tea is still very small. Relevant departments are using the soil-wrapped layering propagation method to cultivate it on a large scale in the production area. (Zhang Shanlu)

    “金面奇兰”新茶种
    在福建省平和县的九峰、皇田一带的茶山上，新近发现了一种极其稀有的新茶种——“金面奇兰”。这种茶，茶身重、叶肉厚、冲水次数多、泡水后色泽金黄有光、气味芳香，除了具有一般名茶的优点之外，还有治疗初期郁症和发高热等疾病的特殊功效。
    目前，这种茶的数量还很少，有关部门正在产区采用包土分枝育苗法大量培植。　（张善籙）
