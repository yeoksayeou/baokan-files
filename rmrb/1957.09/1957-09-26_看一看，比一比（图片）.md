Look and Compare
In the No. 2 Cooperative of the Miaopu Township Nursery in Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, the socialist education movement created a method combining accounting comparisons, field visits, and material and living exhibitions, which played a significant role in educating cooperative members.

At the debate, some well-to-do middle peasants were persuaded on the spot regarding their capitalist thinking, but a few well-to-do middle peasants with particularly serious capitalist tendencies remained unconvinced. Disregarding the fact that the cooperative's production had increased year after year, they insisted that the accounts of increased income and improved living standards for cooperative members were deliberately fabricated by the cooperative cadres, expressing doubt. They also claimed that individual farmers' production was not necessarily worse than that of cooperatives. In response to this situation, the cooperative adopted the method of field visits and material and living exhibitions. Faced with ironclad facts, they were finally persuaded and expressed their intention to actively produce in the cooperative and wholeheartedly follow the socialist road in the future. The broad masses of cooperative members also received a vivid education from this.

	Members of the No. 2 Cooperative of Miaopu are taking turns visiting the sesame crop harvested this year. The bundle on the right is from individual farmer Dong Guanglu, which is more than a foot shorter than the bundle grown by the cooperative on the left, and the seeds are not as plump as those from the cooperative.
	This is an exhibition opened by poor peasant cooperative member Liu Mingzhong. On the left side of the wooden board are the new cotton quilts, mosquito nets, and clothing he has acquired in the past two years. On the right is a cotton quilt that Liu Mingzhong's grandmother used when she got married eighty years ago. Holding the tattered cotton wadding is Liu Mingzhong, who is explaining the changes in life before and after cooperation to the cooperative members.

    看一看，比一比
    湖北省南漳县苗圃乡苗圃二社，在开展社会主义教育运动中，创造了算账对比和田间参观，实物、生活展览会相结合的办法，对教育社员起了很大作用。
    在辩论会上，有些富裕中农的资本主义思想当场就被说服，但仍然有少数资本主义思想特别严重的富裕中农不服气，他们不顾这个社年年增产的事实，硬说社员的增加收入和生活改善账，是社干部故意编出来的，表示怀疑；还说什么单干农民的生产不见得比合作社搞得差。针对这种情况，社里便采取了田间参观，实物和生活展览会的办法。在铁的事实面前，他们终于被说服了，并且表示今后要在社里积极生产，一心一意走社会主义的道路，广大社员也都从中受到了生动的教育。

    苗圃二社的社员们正在轮流参观今年收获的芝麻。右边一捆是单干农民董光禄的，比左边合作社种的一捆矮一尺多，籽粒也没有社里的饱满。
    这是贫农社员刘明中开的一个展览会。左面木板上放的是他近二年来新添的棉被、蚊帐和衣服等实物。右边是八十年前刘明中的奶奶出嫁时盖的一床棉被。拿着烂棉絮的是刘明中，他正向社员讲解合作化前后的生活变化。
