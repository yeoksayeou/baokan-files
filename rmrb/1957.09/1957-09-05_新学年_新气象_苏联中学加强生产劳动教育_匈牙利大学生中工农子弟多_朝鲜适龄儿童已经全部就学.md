    New School Year, New Atmosphere
    Soviet Secondary Schools Strengthen Production Labor Education; More Students from Worker and Peasant Families in Hungary's Universities; All Eligible Children in North Korea Now Enrolled in School
    Moscow Dispatch: The new school year 1957-1958 began in Soviet schools at all levels on Monday, September 2nd. Thousands upon thousands of new students entered the existing and newly established schools throughout the country.
    This year, Soviet secondary schools will further strengthen students' production theory and labor education on the basis of strengthening comprehensive technical education and eliminating certain disconnects between teaching and life.
    In higher education, Soviet colleges and universities enrolled 420,000 new students this year. Among them, 60% are working youth and demobilized soldiers who have participated in production. The higher education institutions directly under the Ministry of Higher Education alone have enrolled more than 50,000 working youths. Among the 4,980 new students in the sixteen colleges and universities in Odessa, 1,500 came from production posts.

    Hungarian universities will strengthen the teaching of Marxism-Leninism in this academic year. Systematic political theory lectures are also offered for primary and secondary school teachers in various places, enabling them to study Marxism-Leninism to improve their political and ideological level.
    Attention was also paid to the composition of students in this year's university admissions. More than 50% of the new university students are children of workers and peasants. The quality of new students is also relatively good. Among the 15,000 people who applied to universities this year, 5,000 were admitted, of which more than 60% were academically excellent and 30% were good.
    Pyongyang Dispatch: Schools at all levels in North Korea began the new school year on the 2nd. According to the compulsory primary education system implemented since last year, all eligible children are now enrolled in school.

    在高等教育方面，苏联高等学校今年招收了四十二万新生。其中60％是参加过生产的劳动青年和复员军人。单是高等教育部直属的各高等学校就招收了五万多劳动青年。敖德萨十六所高等学校的四千九百八十名新生中，有一千五百名是从生产岗位上来的。

    匈牙利的大学在这一学年中将加强马克思列宁主义的教学。各地还为中小学教员开设有系统的政治理论讲座，使他们能够进行马克思列宁主义学习，以提高政治思想水平。
    今年在招收大学生方面也注意到学生的成分。在大学新生中有50％以上是工农子弟。新生质量也比较好。在今年投考大学的一万五千人中录取了五千人，其中有60％以上是学业优秀者，30％是成绩良好者。
