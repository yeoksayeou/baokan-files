    Welcoming the Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation
    Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture
    Prince Norodom Sihanouk's visit to our country in early 1956 and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia in November of the same year have brought about new developments in the inherent friendship between China and Cambodia. The ancient and rich culture and art of Cambodia have always been something the Chinese people have longed to appreciate and understand. Today, the wishes of the Chinese people have been realized. The Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation, headed by Princess Bopha Devi and Prince Chakrapong, and led by Fang Bingxun, Deputy Secretary of State of Education of Cambodia, has arrived in our capital on the eve of our National Day. The artistic flowers and sincere friendship they bring add much joy and splendor to our wonderful festival. Let us extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to our distinguished guests!
    China and Cambodia have had close exchanges and cultural ties since very early times. In Chinese historical records, there are vivid examples of this as early as the third century. Cambodian monks came to China to translate scriptures, and the Chinese people listened to the performances of Cambodian musicians. Today, outstanding representatives of Cambodian culture and art have come to our country again for a formal visit and performance. The broad masses of our people and cultural and art workers will have a good opportunity to appreciate and learn from the excellent culture and art of Cambodia, and the cultural exchanges and friendly relations between China and Cambodia will be further developed.
    Beautiful and rich Cambodia has a long history and ancient and rich culture. The hardworking and kind Cambodian people have created outstanding culture and art with their genius, wisdom and hard work. We will see the life, customs and creativity of the Cambodian people from the Cambodian music and dance to be performed soon.
    The Khmer royal dance performed by the Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation is not only unique in style and distinctive in national characteristics, but also rich and colorful in content and form. For example, the Fan Dance, the Apsara Dance, the Butterfly Dance, and the dance drama "Prah Vesantara" are all very beautiful dances, and the dances are accompanied by moving songs to explain the gestures and plots of the performers.
    The Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation is composed of artists from the Kingdom of Cambodia with profound artistic accomplishments. They all grew up in families that have dedicated themselves to art for generations, and they have been learning dance and singing since childhood. In particular, Princess Bopha Devi and Prince Chakrapong also personally participated in the performance, which not only added splendor to the performance, but also brought great honor to the Chinese people. For this, let us express our heartfelt thanks to the distinguished guests.
    Beautiful flowers will surely bear good fruit, and sincere friendship will surely develop day by day. Let us wish the Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation a great success in its performance, and the friendly relations between China and Cambodia will be consolidated and developed day by day!

    欢迎柬埔寨文化艺术代表团
    文化部部长　沈雁冰
    1956年初西哈努克亲王在我国的访问和同年11月我国周恩来总理在柬埔寨王国的访问，使中柬两国之间固有的友谊得到了新的发展。柬埔寨的古老和丰富的文化艺术，一直是中国人民渴望欣赏和了解的。今天，中国人民的愿望实现了，以拍花·黛维公主和夏卡朋王子为首的、由柬埔寨教育副国务秘书方炳顺团长率领的柬埔寨文化艺术代表团，在我们的国庆节即将来临的时候来到我们的国都。他们带来的艺术鲜花和真诚的友谊，为我们美好的节日增添了不少欢乐和光彩，让我们向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢！
    中柬两国之间在很早的时候就有着密切的往来和文化联系。在中国的史册里，早在三世纪就记载着这方面生动的事例，柬埔寨的高僧们曾到中国翻译过经卷，中国人民曾聆听过柬埔寨音乐家的演奏。今天柬埔寨文化艺术的优秀代表们又来到我们的国家作正式的访问和演出。我国的广大人民和文化艺术工作者们将得到一个欣赏和学习柬埔寨优秀文化艺术的良好机会，中柬两国的文化交流和友谊关系也将得到更进一步的发展。
    美丽而富饶的柬埔寨有着悠久的历史和古老丰富的文化。勤劳善良的柬埔寨人民用他们的天才智慧和辛勤劳动创造了优秀的文化艺术，我们将从即将演出的柬埔寨音乐和舞蹈中看到柬埔寨人民的生活、习俗和创造力。
    柬埔寨文化艺术代表团演出的高棉皇家舞蹈不仅风格独特、民族色彩鲜明，而且内容形式也丰富多彩。例如扇舞、天使舞、蝴蝶舞和舞剧“斐拉沙恩”等都是十分优美的舞蹈，而且舞蹈时并有动人的歌唱来说明表演者的手势和情节。
    柬埔寨文化艺术代表团是由柬埔寨王国具有高深艺术造诣的艺术家们组成的。他们都生长在世世代代为艺术而献身的家庭中，他们自小就学习舞蹈和歌唱。特别是拍花·黛维公主和夏卡朋王子也亲自参加演出，这不仅给演出增加光彩，而且给中国人民带来了极大的光荣。为此，让我们向贵宾们表示衷心的感谢。
    美好的鲜花，一定要结好的果实，真诚的友谊，一定要日益发展。让我们预祝柬埔寨文化艺术代表团的演出获得巨大的成功，中柬两国的友好关系日益巩固和发展！
