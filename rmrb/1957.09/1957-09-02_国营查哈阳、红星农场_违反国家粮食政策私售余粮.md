State-owned Chahayang and Hongxing Farms
    Violate National Grain Policy by Privately Selling Surplus Grain
    (Our report) Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Supervisory Department conducted an inspection of the Chahayang and Hongxing Farms regarding their implementation of grain policies and grain storage and processing. The inspection revealed that these two farms had committed serious violations of the unified grain purchase and sales policy. For example, without the approval of higher authorities and grain departments, the Hongxing Farm privately sold more than 250,000 jin of grain to the families of employees, farmers, and local tofu shops. The Chahayang Farm, just team one of the third branch and team one of the fourth branch sold over 13,000 jin of low-priced coarse rice and broken rice to the families of employees. Some family members transported the grain they bought to other places to sell at high prices, and some even used rice as gifts when visiting relatives. The two farms were also lax in implementing the grain supply system. For example, in 1956, the Chahayang Farm allowed temporary workers who had no grain supply relationship to consume more than 890,000 jin of grain. This year, there are still 300 long-term temporary workers without a grain supply relationship who continue to receive grain. In addition, the Chahayang Farm currently has more than 1,400 tons of surplus grain that should be sold to the state, but has not been handed over.
    The inspection also revealed that the Chahayang Farm was wasting grain. In the processing plant and the fourth branch alone, more than 200,000 jin of grain and more than 49,000 jin of feed became moldy and deteriorated due to poor storage. Currently, most of the finished grain stored in the processing plant has excessively high temperatures (some reaching 45 degrees Celsius), which is very dangerous. In terms of processing, the rice yield is low due to chaotic management and outdated equipment. From January to June this year, more than 1,800 tons of raw grain were processed, and the national regulations stipulate that the rice yield should be 75%, but the actual rice yield was only 66.5%, resulting in a loss of more than 150 tons of grain. The farm's employee cafeteria often uses a large amount of leftover food to feed pigs, and a lot of rice is scattered on the tables and on the ground. Despite such waste, there is still a surplus every month. For example, the main farm averages 500 to 700 people eating each month, and from January to May this year, there was a surplus of more than 10,000 jin of grain.
    After the inspection, the Heilongjiang Provincial Supervisory Department has suggested that the Provincial People's Committee instruct these two farms to immediately sell the surplus grain that should have been sold to the state, and to earnestly improve grain storage and processing, and to stop violations of grain policies and the waste and loss of grain.

    国营查哈阳、红星农场
    违反国家粮食政策私售余粮
    本报讯  最近黑龙江省监察厅对查哈阳、红星农场执行粮食政策和粮食保管、加工等情况进行了检查。检查中发现这两个农场违反粮食统购统销政策的情况相当严重。如红星农场未经上级和粮食部门同意，私自出售给职工家属、农民和当地豆腐房粮食二十五万余斤；查哈阳农场仅三分场一队和四分场一队以低价卖给职工家属糙米和碎大米达一万三千余斤。有的家属将买到的粮食运往外地高价出售，有的串亲戚还用大米送礼。这两个农场在执行粮食供应制度上也很松懈，如查哈阳农场在1956年，让没有粮食供应关系的临时工吃掉粮食八十九万余斤，今年也有三百名长期临时工没有粮食供应关系，照常吃粮。此外，查哈阳农场现有一千四百多吨余粮应该卖给国家，而未交售。
    检查中还发现查哈阳农场有浪费粮食的情况。仅加工厂和四分场由于保管不善就有二十多万斤粮食和四万九千多斤饲料发霉变质。目前加工厂储存的成品粮大部分温度过高（有些已达到摄氏45度），危险性很大。在加工方面由于管理混乱和设备陈旧，出米率低。今年1至6月，加工原粮一千八百余吨，照国家规定出米率应为75％，而实际出米率只有66.5％，少出粮食一百五十余吨。该场职工食堂常用大量的剩饭喂猪，桌上地下撒饭很多，如此浪费粮食，每月尚有结余，如总场平均每月有五百到七百人吃饭，今年1至5月，就结余粮食一万余斤。
    黑龙江省监察厅在检查后已建议省人民委员会责成这两个农场，把应卖给国家而未卖的余粮立即卖给国家，并切实改进粮食保管、加工工作，制止违反粮食政策和浪费损失粮食的现象。 （坚言）（附图片）
