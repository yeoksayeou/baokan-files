    In the recent two-plus months of the anti-Rightist struggle, engineering and technical personnel from the central industrial and transportation departments have been speaking at large and small forums and debates, posting big-character posters, and writing articles in newspapers and periodicals, exposing and refuting the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of bourgeois Rightists in engineering and technical circles.

    When refuting the Rightists' fallacies that "the Five-Year Plan was a mess" and that transportation and postal services were "worse than before," engineering and technical personnel in various industrial and transportation and postal departments made a clear comparison between the development conditions of the two different eras, old and new China, based on their personal experiences. Some technical personnel in the industrial sector pointed out that in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party, from 1950 to 1956, about 19.8 billion yuan was used for industrial construction in seven years, while the result of a century of industrial development in old China was that the assets of all industrial enterprises were only worth more than 9 billion yuan. If it were not for the correct leadership of the Communist Party, where would such great construction achievements come from? Engineering and technical personnel of the Building Materials Industry Department cited the rapid development of the cement and glass industries since liberation to refute the fallacies of Rightists Huang Daneng, Wang Enming, Zhu Zubei, and others in the department who negated the achievements of construction. They said that in 1949, at the beginning of liberation, the national cement production was only 660,000 tons, but in 1957 it could reach 6.8 million tons, more than twice the highest annual output in history in 1942. In 1949, the national glass production was only 1.07 million boxes, but in 1957 it could reach 4.2 million boxes. Before liberation, there were only four varieties of cement, but now there are fifteen; at present, the varieties of glass have also increased by more than double compared with before liberation. Many engineering and technical personnel of the First Ministry of Machine Building, in refuting the fallacy of Rightist Lei Tianjue that "the national technical force has shrunk and technology has regressed," pointed out that machine products that old China could not manufacture, such as jet airplanes, automobiles, blast furnace and open hearth furnace equipment, hydro and thermal power equipment, sugar making machines, and precision machine tools, can now be manufactured. In the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building alone, nearly 3,000 new products have been produced in the past eight years. Could such achievements be made in a situation of "technical shrinkage"? In refuting the fallacy of Rightist Yan Shaoxi of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, who slandered the achievements of design work, many engineering and technical personnel pointed out that in the old China ruled by the Kuomintang, there were almost no metallurgical design talents. Now, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has established three ferrous metallurgical design institutes, a mining design institute, and a thermal engineering control design institute in the iron and steel industry alone. With the help of Soviet experts, the designers went from not knowing to knowing, from not being able to being able, and now they can not only undertake the single-unit design of various large and small blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and rolling mills, but also undertake the overall design of general joint enterprises. Isn't this a great achievement?

    Engineering and technical personnel in the industrial and transportation departments also cited many examples to refute the Rightists' fallacies that "the Communist Party cannot lead science and technology" and "laymen cannot lead experts." Some engineering and technical personnel of the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry Department pointed out that because the Communist Party insisted on taking learning from the Soviet Union as one of the important policies for leading industrial construction and science and technology, China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry was able to achieve a comprehensive improvement in technical level in a very short period of time through comprehensive imitation. They cited as an example that before liberation, the design of electrical porcelain products blindly copied various countries such as Britain, the United States, Japan, and Germany, resulting in a messy variety of products, many products were duplicated, and the technical force was dispersed. After liberation, in the process of learning from the Soviet Union, the design of electrical porcelain products was unified, the original complex, messy, and duplicated varieties were rectified and simplified, and product series were established, thus leading the development of China's electrical porcelain products onto the correct path. Engineer Wang Xiongxiang of the Civil Design Institute of the Ministry of Urban Construction pointed out that because the party organization of their unit conducted correct leadership over the work of the Civil Design Institute through technical meetings, timely criticized the tendency of archaism and formalism, and proposed the correct policy of "suitable, economical, and paying attention to aesthetics where possible" in line with China's current economic conditions, it guided the vast number of designers onto the correct path. He also cited an example that at a technical meeting of the Civil Design Institute, when discussing the formulation of the 1957 savings measures, several major project savings measures were opposed by some people, but because the Party adhered to the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and lowering standards, it finally formulated correct savings measures. It was later proved that the implementation of these measures on only some projects reduced the cost by 1.34 million yuan. He said that such persistent and meticulous maintenance of the overall interests of the country, tirelessly teaching designers to establish the idea of building the country diligently and thriftily, and guiding the design work to develop in a healthy direction, isn't it the Communist Party that the Rightists call "laymen"? The Rightists keep clamoring that "laymen cannot lead experts," which is a slander against the Communist Party.

    中央工业交通部门的工程技术人员
    摆出有力的事实粉碎右派的谰言
    证明没有共产党的坚强领导不可能有如此伟大的成就
    据新华社6日讯　在最近两个多月的反右派斗争中，中央各工业和交通部门的工程技术人员，纷纷在大小座谈会、辩论会上发言，张贴大字报，在报纸刊物上写文章，揭露和驳斥了工程技术界中资产阶级右派分子的反共反社会主义的言行。
    各工业和交通邮电部门的工程技术人员，在驳斥右派分子诬蔑 “五年计划搞糟了”、交通邮电事业“今不如昔”的谬论时，把亲身经历的新旧中国两个不同时代的发展状况，做了鲜明的对比。工业部门的一些技术人员指出，在共产党领导下的新中国，从1950年到1956年，七年中用在工业建设的资金约一百九十八亿元，而旧中国发展工业一百年的结果，全部工业企业的资产才值九十多亿元。如果不是共产党的正确领导，这么巨大的建设成就从何而来呢？建筑材料工业部的工程技术人员，举出解放以后水泥、玻璃工业飞速发展的事例，驳斥本部门的右派分子黄大能、王恩明、朱祖培等否定建设成绩的谬论。他们说，在解放初的1949年，全国水泥产量只不过六十六万吨，1957年就能达到六百八十万吨，比历史上年产量最高的1942年还提高两倍。1949年全国玻璃产量只有一百零七万箱，1957年就能达到四百二十万箱。解放以前，水泥只有四个品种，现在已经有十五个品种；目前玻璃的品种，也比解放以前增加了一倍多。第一机械工业部的许多工程技术人员，在驳斥右派分子雷天觉所谓“全国技术力量萎缩、技术倒退”的谬论时指出，旧中国不能制造的机器产品，如喷气式飞机、汽车、高炉和平炉设备、水电和火电设备、制糖机和精密机床，现在都能制造了。只是第一机械工业部所属的工厂中，八年来就生产了近三千种新产品。难道在“技术萎缩”的情况下，能取得这样的成就吗！冶金工业部在驳斥右派分子阎绍玺诬蔑设计工作成就的谬论时，许多工程技术人员指出，国民党统治的旧中国，几乎没有冶金方面的设计人才。现在，冶金工业部只是在钢铁工业方面就建立了三个黑色冶金设计院、一个矿山设计院、一个热工控制设计院。设计人员在苏联专家的帮助下，从不懂到懂，从不会到会，现在不仅能够担任各种大小高炉、平炉、轧钢车间的单体设计，而且还能担任一般联合企业的总体设计。这不是巨大的成就吗！
    工业和交通部门的工程技术人员，还举出许多事例，驳斥右派分子诬蔑“共产党不能领导科学技术”、“外行不能领导内行”的谬论。电机制造工业部的一些工程技术人员，指出由于共产党坚持把学习苏联作为领导工业建设和科学技术的重要政策之一，从而使我国的电机制造工业能够在极短的时间内，通过全面仿制，达到技术水平的全面提高。他们举例说，解放以前，电瓷产品的设计，由于盲目抄袭英、美、日、德各国，品种杂乱，许多产品重复，造成技术力量的分散。解放以后，在学习苏联的过程中，统一了电瓷产品设计，将原有复杂、凌乱、重复的品种加以整顿、简化，建立了产品系列，这样就将我国电瓷产品的发展引上正确的道路。城市建设部民用设计院工程师汪熊祥指出，由于他们单位的党组织通过技术会议对民用设计院的工作进行了正确的领导，及时地批判了复古主义和形式主义的偏向，提出“适用、经济在可能条件下注意美观”这一符合我国当前经济条件的正确方针，引导着广大设计人员走上了正确的道路。他还举例说，在民用设计院的一次技术会议上，讨论制定1957年的节约措施时，有几项重大项目的节约措施，遭到了一些人的反对，但由于党坚持了勤俭建国、降低标准的方针，终于制定出正确的节约措施。事后证明，这些措施仅在部分工程上实行就降低了造价一百三十四万元。他说，这样坚持不懈地、不分巨细地维护国家的总利益，不倦地教导设计人员树立勤俭建国的思想，引导设计工作向健康的方向发展的，不正是右派分子称之为“外行”的共产党吗？右派分子口口声声嚷着“外行不能领导内行”，这是对共产党的诬蔑。
