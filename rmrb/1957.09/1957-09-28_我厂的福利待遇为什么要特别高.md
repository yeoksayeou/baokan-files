	Why are the welfare benefits in our factory particularly high?
	I am now raising several questions in the hope that the leadership will consider them, and I also hope that all the workers and comrades in the factory will discuss these issues.
	(1)	Regarding the issue of safety bonuses
	In the big-character posters, many comrades have pointed out that the current safety bonus system in the power plant is unreasonable. Some advocate for its cancellation, while others propose retaining it after modifications. I will not discuss the issue of whether to keep it or remove it for now. First, let me point out that in some aspects, our factory's bonus method has not been implemented in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. For example, in May of last year, the Ministry of Electric Power issued an instruction, promulgating new regulations for accident-free rewards, and instructed all units to study them carefully, prepare well, and implement them no later than October 1st, while simultaneously abolishing the original method. In the new method, the bonus rates for some people were increased, such as the plant director, shift supervisor, and chief shift supervisor. However, the bonus rates for some people should have been lowered. Examples are as follows:

	Title	Ministry-set Bonus Rate (Twelve installments)	Current Bonus Rate in Our Factory (Twelve installments)
	Laboratory Director	30%	40%
	Electrical/Mechanical/Boiler Repair Worker	25%	20%
	Communication Worker	No Safety Bonus	20%
	Relay Protection Device Personnel	20%	30%
	Boiler/Mechanical Repair Foreman	30%	35%
	Condenser Operator	20%	25%
	Assistant Turbine Operator	20%	30%
	Turbine Driver Assistant	15%	20%
	Evaporator Heater, Circulation Pump, Pressure Reducing and Desuperheating Valve Operator	15%	20%

	Of course, in order to prevent cadres from becoming detached from the masses and to avoid excessive disparities, it is appropriate not to raise the higher ones. However, why are our factory's wages and bonuses higher than those of other enterprises in Beijing, and also higher than those in the electricity sector in the Beijing area, and why are adjustments not being made despite the explicit regulations of the Ministry of Electric Power?
	(2)	Regarding the issue of medical benefits
	Our factory's medical benefits far exceed the Labor Insurance Regulations. Of course, there are certain reasons and bases for doing so. However, on April 21, 1956, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the National Committee of the Chinese Electrical Workers' Union jointly issued a notice, uniformly stipulating that "for family members seeking medical treatment, the administrative department should bear the registration fee, ordinary examination fee, ordinary laboratory test fee, and treatment fee, and bear one-half of the surgical and medication fees, while all other expenses should be borne by the individual." Other units have implemented this regulation, but our factory has not. Currently, when our factory's employees' family members see a doctor at the factory's health station, they do not spend any money. When they go to designated hospitals in Beijing, all expenses (including medical expenses, expensive drug expenses, and hospitalization meal expenses, etc.) are half-borne by the administration. This item alone costs the state about 20,000 yuan more each year. At the same time, because seeing a doctor is free, it also causes chaos for medical staff and wastes medicine. More typical is that after this regulation was issued to our factory, the factory director instructed the medical office and the salary department to invite the labor insurance director of the trade union to study it; however, our trade union chairman, Comrade Zheng Guotai, wrote the following comment: "Before the new Labor Insurance Regulations are promulgated, projects that are beneficial to workers' welfare should be increased, and those that existed previously but are inconsistent with recent instructions from higher authorities should be temporarily retained and not be easily cancelled." What kind of implementation of national regulations is this? Why can increases be increased, but decreases cannot be decreased? Isn't this the ideology of economism at work? Please consider this, leaders, and discuss it, everyone.
	(3)	Regarding the issue of collecting rent and fees for water, electricity, and furniture in housing
	On September 14, 1955, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee issued a notice, and forwarded the State Council's order, which clearly stated: "State personnel on the wage system who live in public housing and use public furniture and water and electricity should all pay rent and fees." However, our factory has never considered this issue. After the wage reform in 1956, wages were greatly increased (the national increase in wage levels was 13%, but our factory increased by more than 22%), but the issue of charging for housing, water, electricity, and furniture was not considered. What attitude is this towards national regulations? Why is it repeatedly delayed whenever these issues are encountered?
	(4)	Regarding the issue of overtime pay
	The current standard for overtime pay in our factory is 200% of the wage for overtime (regardless of holiday overtime or weekend overtime), 150% for overtime within two hours, and 200% for the portion exceeding two hours. Article 13 of the method also stipulates: "If this method conflicts with the regulations promulgated by higher authorities, it shall be revised in accordance with the spirit of the higher authorities' promulgation." However, in May 1956, the Ministry of Labor issued a notice, explicitly stipulating that "200% shall be paid for holiday overtime, and 150% shall be paid for overtime on regular days off and extra hours," and pointed out that "it should be implemented from May 1, 1956. Any previous regulations that conflict with this regulation shall be implemented in accordance with this regulation." But we did not change it. In the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's regulations on overtime, which were forwarded by the Beijing Electric Power Bureau on January 12 of this year, it was also clearly stipulated that "200% shall be paid for holiday overtime, and 150% shall be paid for overtime and extra hours on regular days off," and it was also pointed out that "it should be implemented from January 1957, and the original method should be abolished at the same time." Our factory did not implement the instructions of the Ministry of Electric Power. Doesn't this count as not implementing national regulations? Why is it that increases are quickly increased, but reductions that should be reduced according to national regulations are not reduced?
	From the above issues, it can be seen that the leadership of our factory has some shortcomings in implementing national regulations, especially the thinking of not suppressing the high ones and raising the low ones has existed for a long time. I hope the leadership will study this carefully. I believe that anything that has not been implemented in accordance with national regulations should be quickly corrected in accordance with national unified regulations.

### 我厂的福利待遇为什么要特别高

专栏：企业里的大字报

    我厂的福利待遇为什么要特别高
    我现在提出几个问题来，希望领导上考虑，同时也希望全厂职工同志们对这些问题进行讨论。
    （一）关于安全奖的问题
    在大字报上，很多同志都提出，电厂现行的安全奖励制度不合理，有的主张取消，有的主张修改后保留。我现在暂不谈关于去和留的问题，先说一下我厂这个奖励办法在某些方面也是没有按照电力工业部的规定执行的。如去年5月电力部就发出指示，颁布了新的无事故奖励条例，并指示各单位应很好地研究，做好准备，最迟不得晚于10月1日执行，并且同时废止原办法。在新办法中，有些人提高了奖金率，如场主任、值长、总值长等；但是有些人的奖金率是应压低的。举例如下：
    职称  部定奖金率（十二期数）  我厂现行奖金率（十二期数）
    试验室主任  30％　40％
    电气机炉检修工　25％　20％
    通讯工　不得安全奖　20％
    继电保护装置人员　20％　30％
    机炉检修班长　30％　35％
    凝结器值班工　20％　25％
    汽机副司机　20％　30％
    汽机司机助手　15％　20％
    蒸发器加热器、循环泵、减压减温器值班工  15％　20％
    当然，为了使干部不脱离群众、不过份高低悬殊，高的不提是应该的。但是，为什么我们厂的工资、奖励都高于北京市的其它各企业，也高于北京地区的电业部门，电力部又有明文规定而不进行调整呢？
    （二）关于医疗待遇的问题
    我们厂的医疗待遇远远地超过劳动保险条例。当然，这样做是有一定原因和一定根据的。但是，1956年4月21日电力工业部和中国电业工会全国委员会发出了联合通知，统一规定了“家属看病除挂号费、普通检查费、普通化验费和处理费由行政负担和手术费、药费由行政负担二分之一外，其他均应由本人负担”。这一规定，其它单位都执行了，但是我们厂却没有按这一规定执行。现在，我们厂的职工家属在本厂保健站看病，什么钱都不花，到北京特约医院去，不论什么钱（包括医药费，贵重药品费和住院膳费等）都由行政负担一半。只此一项，每年国家所多负担的费用就约有二万元左右。同时，由于看病不花钱，也造成医务人员的忙乱和药品的浪费。更典型的是，这一规定发到我厂后，厂长批了让医务室、工资科约请工会劳保主任研究；但是，我们的工会主席郑国太同志却批了以下的批语：“在新劳保条例未公布前，应该对那些有利于工人福利的项目增加上来，对那些原有而与最近上级指示不符的，还应当暂作保留，不应随便取消。”这是怎么样的执行国家规定呢？为什么增的可以增，而减的就不能减呢？这算不算是经济主义思想在作祟呢？请领导考虑，请大家讨论。
    （三）关于住房收租和收水电家具费的问题
    1955年9月14日，北京市人民委员会曾发出通知，并转发了国务院的命令，其中明确指出：“工资制的国家工作人员住用公家房屋和使用公家家具水电者，应一律交租纳费。”但是我厂一直都没有考虑这一问题。1956年工资改革以后，大量地增加了工资（全国提高工资的水平是13％，我们厂却提高22％以上），但也未考虑房、水、电、家具收费的问题。这又是以什么态度来对待国家规定呢？为什么一碰到这些问题就一再拖延不办呢？
    （四）关于加班费问题
    我厂现行的加班加点费支给标准，是加班（不论节日加班或假日加班）支给工资的200％，加班在两小时以内者150％，超过二小时者其超过部分支给200％。办法的第十三条中还规定：“本办法如与上级颁布规定有抵触时，得按上级颁发之精神进行修改。”但是1956年5月劳动部发出了通知，明确规定“节日加班支给200％，例假日加班和加点一律支给150％”，并指出“应自1956年5月1日起实行。过去规定与本规定有抵触者，均应按本规定执行”。但是我们并没有改。北京电业局在今年1月12日转来的电力工业部关于加班加点规定中，也明确规定“节日加班支给200％，例假日加班加点一律支给150％”，还指出“应自1957年1月份起实行，同时废止原有的办法”。我厂也没有按电力部指示执行。这算不算不执行国家规定？为什么增加的就很快的增上去，而按国家规定应减下来的却不减下来呢？
    从以上几个问题来看，我们厂领导方面对执行国家规定是有些缺点的，特别是高的不压、低的提上来的思想是较长时期就存在的。希望领导上很好研究研究。我认为，凡是未执行国家规定的，都应该按国家统一规定迅速纠正。
