Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 24th. The Hong Kong and Macao men's and women's table tennis teams concluded their matches against the Shanghai team on the evening of the 23rd.

Over the course of four days, the two teams played four matches against the Shanghai team. The Hong Kong team won all four matches, while the Macao team won one and lost three. However, Rong Guotuan, the Hong Kong champion in singles and doubles last year, lost to Yang Ruihua of the Shanghai team on the 21st with a score of 0-2. Yang Ruihua played very cleverly in this match, constantly dinking the ball to both corners, suppressing his opponent’s strong chop. Rong Guotuan was therefore forced to change to fierce smashes, competing with Yang Ruihua in attack. However, Yang Ruihua was faster and had the advantage, winning with scores of 21-15 and 21-18. The Hong Kong and Macao table tennis teams arrived in Shanghai on the 18th, and they will travel to Hangzhou from Shanghai for a visit.

    港澳乒乓球队在上海比赛结束
    新华社上海24日电　香港、澳门男女乒乓球队23日晚结束了对上海队的比赛。
    这两个队在四天中分别同上海队进行了四场比赛。其中香港队四场连赢，澳门队赢一场败三场。但是香港去年的单双打冠军容国团，21日以零比二败给了上海队的杨瑞华。杨瑞华在这一局比赛中打得很聪明，他始终轻吊两角，压住对方擅长的搓球。容国团因此只能改用猛抽，与杨瑞华抢攻。但是杨瑞华出手快，又占着优势，先后以二十一比十五、二十一比十八获胜。香港、澳门乒乓球队是18日到上海的，他们将由上海去杭州访问。
