The members of the Tianjin First Tool and Agricultural Machinery Handicraft Cooperative recognized right and wrong through a major debate on the two roads. More than 40 members who had once lost their way proposed on the spot to resolutely safeguard the collective interests of the cooperative, and the members who had previously requested to withdraw from the cooperative also automatically withdrew their requests.
Xinhua News Agency report by reporter Zhao Yuxin: The members of the Tianjin First Tool and Agricultural Machinery Handicraft Cooperative, after more than a month of major debate on the two roads, have clarified the major issues of right and wrong. Some members who had lost their way have abandoned the capitalist road and are determined to take the socialist road.

This large handicraft cooperative with 507 members, capable of manufacturing more than 100 kinds of products simultaneously, has seen rapid production development since its establishment in early 1956. Last year, it manufactured 110,000 single-tube compression sprayers. This year, just as it was preparing to expand its factory buildings and further develop production, 22 members of the Fifth Workshop suddenly announced a work stoppage on June 6, demanding advance payment of the over-quota bonus for June. When the cooperative's responsible cadres rejected this unreasonable request, they further proposed to divide the cooperative's machines and accumulated funds, dissolve the large cooperative, and freely form several small cooperatives. Some members from small-proprietor backgrounds also joined the work stoppage with the same slogan, claiming that they would definitely break up the cooperative. Some members from small-business backgrounds openly shouted that "cooperatives have no superiority," insisting that the cooperative "exploited" them. Some proposed to withdraw from the cooperative with their entire families and take away lathes and divide the funds.

What force was driving these members to break up the cooperative? It turned out that the cooperative had nine self-financing supply and marketing households, all of whom were allowed to operate independently because the cooperative accommodated their requirements or operating characteristics. After operating independently, some of them secretly engaged in speculation and profiteering, hired labor for exploitation, and reaped huge profits under the banner of the cooperative. Li Bingchen, a supply and marketing household, often bought raw materials from the cooperative at low prices and sold them on the market, making hundreds of yuan with a single move. He also pulled four or five members from the cooperative to work for him at night. In May of this year, the supply and marketing households Li Bingchen, Wu Qingyun, and others became even more arrogant, often flaunting their speculative careers of "earning three or four hundred yuan with a swing of the arm" to the members, attempting to entice more people to withdraw from the cooperative. The phenomenon of sudden wealth among these illegal supply and marketing households made many members from small-business backgrounds envious.

With the help of the higher-level Party committee, the Communist Party branch of this cooperative analyzed the nature of this incident, believing that these phenomena were a concrete reflection of the struggle between the two roads. It was necessary to adopt the method of major debate to enable the members to recognize the major issues of right and wrong and choose the path they wanted to take.

At the general membership meeting on July 30, everyone enthusiastically debated the question of whether cooperativization had any superiority. Seven or eight members listed the achievements of the cooperative since its establishment, saying: Currently, the cooperative has nearly 200 various machines, and 80% of the operations have been mechanized. In the year and a half since its establishment, the total value of assets has increased from 51,000 yuan to 610,000 yuan, and the products have been sold to 13 provinces and four cities. The average salary of members has reached 63 yuan, an increase of 90% compared to the time of its establishment. In the first half of this year, 36 members newly bought bicycles, 26 members bought watches, more than 60% of the members have savings in the bank, and 90% of the members participated in amateur school studies. These concrete facts made many people recognize the superiority of cooperativization.

However, members Dong Tingquan, Zhang Guoquan, and others believed that cooperativization was not as profitable as working individually for members with machines, labor, and youthful strength. This statement was immediately criticized by many people. Master worker Wang Fengshan pointed to the young member Zhang Guoquan and said, "Three or four years ago, when you worked for a small business owner, the pants you wore had holes showing your buttocks, but now you go to dance parties every Saturday wearing a watch and a woolen uniform. Let everyone judge: which one is better to you, the cooperative or the capitalist?" Zhang Guoquan was left speechless. Member Chang Shanzhang criticized Dong Tingquan, saying, "Three or four years ago, before you joined the cooperative, you were just a small business owner with a small hand-held mill and some simple tools, and your income at that time was not enough to support your entire family. You only added a lathe after joining the primary cooperative, and only bought a bicycle after joining the advanced cooperative. Now all seven members of your family have joined the cooperative, with a monthly income of more than 400 yuan. Where has the cooperative wronged you?" Member Wang Xiuhua pointed out that not all small business owners who withdraw from the cooperative to work individually can become rich. Guo Yunguang, who withdrew from the cooperative this spring, was a small business owner with machines and technology, but his wife died a few dozen days after he withdrew from the cooperative. No one took care of his family or helped him. He had to produce, go out to buy raw materials, and cook and take care of his children. His business situation was very poor, and he recently requested to rejoin the cooperative. In the face of the facts, many members who blindly followed the trouble began to wake up. More than 40 members of the Fourth and Fifth Workshops proposed on the spot to resolutely safeguard the collective interests of the cooperative and no longer be fooled by capitalism. Subsequently, Zhai Zhenshan, Guo Huilun, Zhou Wenying, Qin Xuefu, Dong Tingquan, and others who had proposed to withdraw from the cooperative also automatically withdrew their requests. Li Bingchen, a supply and marketing household who had consistently engaged in illegal operations, has been punished by law.

Since the start of the major debate, the phenomena of members arriving late, being absent from work, fighting, and cursing in the streets have decreased, and there have been no requests to withdraw from the cooperative. The cooperative, which had not completed its production plan for half a year, overfulfilled its production plan in all aspects in August. Shu Zhanyuan, the director of the cooperative, told reporters, "Cooperativization cannot be refuted. What this debate has lost is only the evil spirit of capitalism and the shortcomings in business management."

　　合作化的优越性是辩不倒的
　　天津第一工具农械手工业社社员经过两条道路大辩论，认清大是大非。曾经一度迷失方向的四十多名社员当场提出要坚决维护合作社的集体利益，原来提出退社的社员也自动撤销了要求。
    新华社讯  记者赵玉昕报道：天津市第一工具农械手工业合作社的社员，近一个多月来经过两条道路的大辩论，辩明了大是大非。部分迷失方向的社员已经抛弃资本主义道路，坚决走社会主义道路。
    这个拥有五百零七名社员、能同时制造一百多种产品的大型手工业合作社，从1956年初建社到现在，生产发展很快，去年曾制造了十一万台单管压缩喷雾器。今年正当准备扩建厂房，进一步发展生产的时候，第五车间的二十二名社员于6月6日突然宣告停工，要求预发6月份的超额奖金。当合作社的负责干部拒绝了这种不合理的要求的时候，他们更进一步提出要分掉合作社的机器和积累的基金，解散大社，自由组成若干个小型合作社。第四车间的部分社员也以同样的口号参加停工，声言一定要闹散这个合作社。一些小业主出身的社员，公然叫嚷“合作社没有优越性”，硬说合作社“剥削”了他们，有的提出全家退社，还要拉走车床，分掉基金。
    什么力量支配着这些社员要闹散合作社呢？原来，这个合作社有九户自负盈亏的供销户，他们都是由合作社照顾他们的要求或经营特点而准许独立经营的。其中有些人在独立经营以后，就借着合作社的招牌，暗地里投机倒把，雇工剥削，牟取暴利。供销户李炳臣经常从合作社以低价买进原料，拿到市场出售，一举手之间便获利几百元。他并从合作社拉出四、五名社员在夜间为他干活。今年5月，供销户李炳臣、吴庆云等更加嚣张，经常向社员们炫耀他们“晃晃膀子也赚个三二百块”的投机生涯，企图引诱更多的人退社。这些违法供销户的暴发现象，使许多小业主出身的社员眼红了。
    这个合作社的中共支部在上级党委的帮助下，分析了这一事件的性质，认为这些现象正是两条道路的斗争的具体反映，必须采取大辩论的方法，使社员认清大是大非，自己选择所要走的道路。
    在7月30日的全体社员大会上，大家对于合作化到底有没有优越性的问题热烈地展开了辩论。有七、八个社员列举这个合作社自建社以来的成就说：目前这个合作社共有各种机器近两百台，80％的操作实行了机械化。建社一年半中，财产总值已由五万一千元增加到六十一万元，产品已运销到十三个省和四个城市。社员的平均工资已达六十三元，比建社时提高了90％，今年上半年内有三十六个社员新买了自行车，二十六个社员买了手表，有60％以上的社员在银行存了款，有90％的社员参加了业余学校学习。这些具体事实，使许多人认清了合作化的优越性。
    但是，社员董廷权、张国权等人却认为，合作化对于有机器、有劳动力和年青力壮的社员来说，就不如出去单干挣得多。这种说法当即受到许多人的批判。老师傅王凤山指着青年社员张国权说：“三、四年前你给小业主干活的时候，穿的裤子露着屁股，可是现在你每到星期六就带着手表、穿着毛料制服去参加舞会。让大家评评：合作社和资本家那一个对你好？”张国权被问得哑口无言。社员常善章批判董廷权时说：“你在三、四年前没有入社时，也不过是一个有一盘捣子和一些简单工具的小业主，当时的收入还不够维持全家生活。参加了初级合作社才添置了车床，参加高级社才买起了自行车。现在你全家七口人都入了社，每月收入四百多元。合作社哪里亏待你啦？”社员王秀华指出，不是所有退社单干的小业主都能够发财的，今年春天退社的郭云光就是有机器、有技术的小业主，可是他退社几十天后老婆死了，家里无人照顾，无人帮助，自己要生产，要出去买原料，还要做饭看孩子，经营情况很不好，最近他又要求入社。在事实面前，许多盲目跟着闹事的社员开始醒悟了。第四、第五车间的四十多名社员当场提出要坚决维护合作社的集体利益，不再上资本主义的当。接着，提出退社的翟振山、郭惠伦、周文英、秦学甫和董廷权等人，也自动撤销了退社的要求。一贯违法经营的供销户李炳臣已经受到法律制裁。
    从大辩论开始后，社员们迟到、旷工、打架、骂街的现象减少了，要求退社的没有了。已经半年没有完成过生产计划的合作社，8月份超额全面地完成了生产计划。社主任舒占元向记者说：“合作化是辩不倒的，这场辩论失掉的只是资本主义的邪气和经营管理上的缺点。”
