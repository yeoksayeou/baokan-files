Xinhua News Agency, September 28th Dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said in an interview with the Syrian News Agency on September 26 that Saudi Arabian King Saud's visit to Syria was "a support for the policy of positive neutrality and liberation pursued by Syria and Egypt."

On the same day, al-Assali said after meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Jawdat al-Ayoubi: "We are pursuing unity, not division." He said that we discussed Arab affairs, the current situation, and the relationship between the two countries. He also said: "We believe that there is no danger from our side to our brothers, and what is dangerous to us is only Israel and imperialism."

Budapest News: Bashur, head of the Syrian parliamentary delegation and deputy speaker of the parliament, said at a press conference here that the internal situation in Syria is stable, and the masses and all parties unanimously support the government.

Bashur believes that the meeting between the Saudi King and Syrian leaders in Damascus is a very important event. This meeting will be conducive to solving Arab problems. He added that as for the governments of certain Arab countries accepting the "Eisenhower Doctrine," this does not mean that the Arab people have accepted it. Syria rejected the "Eisenhower Plan" because we firmly believe that this plan is a new form of imperialist conspiracy.

All newspapers in Damascus published articles or commentaries on September 27, welcoming King Saud's statement on September 26 expressing support for Syria. "Al-Ra'i al-'Aam" said that this statement was a serious blow to imperialist policy and directly refuted all the accusations against Syria by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd. "Al-Nasr" said that Syria is very pleased to see Saudi Arabia stand in solidarity with Syria at this stage of the "Cold War."

According to Beirut news: A Lebanese government spokesman said on September 27 that Lebanese Acting Foreign Minister Mikawi met with Saudi Arabian King Saud in Damascus on September 26 and "exchanged views on various issues between Arab countries." The spokesman said, "This meeting between Saudi Arabia and Lebanon was frank and detailed."

    叙利亚政界和舆论重视沙特阿拉伯的支持
    本报综合报道　据新华社28日讯：大马士革消息，叙利亚总理阿萨利9月26日在对叙利亚通讯社记者发表谈话时说，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特这次对叙利亚的访问是“对叙利亚和埃及奉行的积极中立和解放政策的支持”。
    同一天，阿萨利在和伊拉克首相乔达特·阿尤比会谈结束后说：“我们追求的是团结而不是分歧。”他说，我们讨论的是阿拉伯事务、目前的局势和两国之间的关系。他又说：“我们相信我们这方面对于我们的弟兄们是没有危险的，对我们有危险的只是以色列和帝国主义。”
    布达佩斯消息：叙利亚议会代表团团长、议会副议长巴舒尔在这里举行的记者招待会上说，叙利亚内部局势稳定，群众和各党派都一致支持政府。
    巴舒尔认为，沙特国王和叙利亚领导人在大马士革的会见是很重要的事件。这次会见将有利于解决阿拉伯问题。他又说，至于某些阿拉伯国家的政府接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”，这并不意味着阿拉伯人民接受了它。叙利亚拒绝了“艾森豪威尔计划”，这是因为我们深信这个计划是帝国主义阴谋的一种新方式。
    大马士革所有报纸在9月27日都发表文章或评论，欢迎沙特国王9月26日发表的表示支持叙利亚的声明。“舆论报”说，这个声明是对帝国主义政策的严重打击，而且直接驳斥了美国国务卿杜勒斯、土耳其总理曼德列斯和英国外交大臣劳埃德对叙利亚的一切指责。“胜利报”说，叙利亚很高兴看到沙特阿拉伯在“冷战”的现阶段同叙利亚团结一致。
    另据贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩政府发言人9月27日说，黎巴嫩代理外交部长迈卡维9月26日在大马士革曾经同沙特阿拉伯国王沙特会谈，“就阿拉伯各国之间的各种问题交换了意见”。发言人说，“沙特阿拉伯同黎巴嫩的这次会谈是坦率而详尽的”。
