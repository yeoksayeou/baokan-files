　　Blossoms of Construction
    Chromite Discovered in Qaidam

　　The chromite ore, which was listed as a key mineral exploration target on the Qinghai Plateau this year, has now been discovered in Cailiang Mountain in the Qaidam Basin. Five chromite deposits have already been discovered in Cailiang Mountain. Its mineralization zone extends for six kilometers; the ore body is fine-grained massive, rich ore up to three meters thick. Since the area around the mining area is ultramafic rock, the scope of the mining area may be further expanded.

　　Chromium is a valuable metal for smelting high-grade alloy steel and refractory materials. At present, most of the chromium used for steelmaking in our country is imported from abroad, and the price is very expensive.

　　Small Blast Furnace Built in Ulanhot

　　A small blast furnace with an annual output of 3,000 tons of iron is being built in the Ulanhot Agricultural Machinery Factory and is expected to be put into production by the end of October this year. After the small blast furnace is completed, the iron required by various iron factories and machinery factories in the Hulunbuir League of Inner Mongolia will be fully supplied. The ore used will be supplied by the Ma'anshan small iron mine near Ulanhot.

　　Extracting Fiber from Bark

　　A newly established artificial lignocellulosic fiber factory in Qingdao has successfully extracted fiber from linden bark and has produced more than 100,000 kilograms of lignocellulosic fiber. The tensile strength of this fiber is similar to that of red hemp and can be used for spinning ropes and twisting threads to weave burlap.

　　Popular Rosin at Home and Abroad

　　In recent years, eighteen local state-owned and jointly-owned rosin factories have been built successively in Nanping, Chong'an, Jian'ou, Yongding and other forest areas in Fujian Province. The rosin produced by these factories enjoys a high reputation in domestic and foreign markets. Two-thirds of the products are sold to Europe, Africa and Southeast Asian countries, earning a large amount of foreign exchange for the country. The province plans to produce more than 20,000 tons of rosin this year.

　　Rushing to Build Large Oxygen Generator

　　The Hangzhou General Machinery Factory is rushing to build a large oxygen generator, which is expected to be fully manufactured and tested by May next year. This large oxygen generator is one hundred times larger than the small oxygen generator recently manufactured by the factory, and can produce 3,350 cubic meters of oxygen per hour; and it can also obtain more than 13,000 cubic meters of nitrogen per hour, providing abundant raw materials for the manufacture of cheap nitrogen fertilizer.

　　Sewing Machine Factory

　　During the first five-year plan period, the North China Sewing Machine Factory has developed from a factory that could only repair and assemble equipment into a manufacturing factory with an annual output of more than 20,000 sewing machines because it made full use of old equipment. Its products have been sold to Southeast Asia and Egypt and other places. In recent years, the more than 300,000 yuan of funds invested by the state in this factory have now been fully recovered, and a lot of profits have been turned over to the state.

　　建设的花朵
    柴达木发现铬铁矿
    列为今年在青海高原找矿重点的铬铁矿，现在已经在柴达木盆地彩梁山发现。彩梁山铬铁矿已经发现五处。它的矿化带延续长达六公里；矿体是微密块状、厚达三公尺的富矿。由于这个矿区的周围都是超基性岩，矿区范围还可能扩大。
    铬铁是炼高级合金钢和耐火材料的贵重金属。我国目前炼钢所用的铬铁，大都从国外进口，价格很贵。
    乌兰浩特建小高炉
    一座年产三千吨铁的小高炉正在乌兰浩特农业机械厂内兴建，预计今年10月底可以投入生产。小高炉建成后，内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟各铁工厂和机械厂所需的铁将得到充分供应。它所用的矿石将由乌兰浩特附近的马鞍山小铁矿供应。
    从树皮中提炼纤维
    青岛市新成立的一个人造木素纤维工厂利用椴树皮提炼纤维成功，并且已经生产出了木素纤维十万多斤。这种纤维的拉力跟红麻差不多，可以用作纺绳和拈线织麻袋布。
　　畅销国内外的松香
    福建省林区南平、崇安、建瓯、永定等地，几年来先后建设起十八个地方国营、公私合营的松香厂。这些工厂出产的松香，在国内外市场上都负有盛誉。有三分之二的产品销到欧洲、非洲和东南亚各国，为国家换取大批外汇。今年全省计划产松香两万多吨。
　　赶造大型制氧机
　　杭州通用机器厂正在赶造大型制氧机，预计可以在明年5月间全部制成并进行试车。这种大型制氧机比这个厂不久以前制造成功的小制氧机大了一百倍，每小时能制造氧气三千三百五十立方公尺；并且每小时还可以获得一万三千多立方公尺的氮气，为制造廉价的氮肥提供丰富的原料。
　　缝纫机制造厂
　　华北缝纫机制造厂在第一个五年计划期间，因为充分利用旧设备，已经由一个只能修修配配的工厂发展成为年产两万多台缝纫机的制造工厂。它的产品已经远销到南洋和埃及等地。几年来，国家对这个工厂所投的三十多万元资金，现在已经全部收回，而且给国家上缴了不少利润。
