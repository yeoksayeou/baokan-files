Unveiling the Secrets of "Party Ownership" and "Four Major Unfreedoms"
    Henan People's Congress Refutes Xu Lingqing
    (By Our Newspaper) Delegates attending the Henan Provincial People's Congress cited various facts to sternly refute the anti-communist fallacies of rightist Xu Lingqing.
    Xu Lingqing was the Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, a Provincial People's Representative, and a member of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference. He slandered, saying, "In recent years, ownership has changed, but it is not yet socialist ownership, but rather Party ownership." His basis for this was that "agricultural cooperatives are all presided over by Party members." He also spread rumors that the Party restricted his freedom in speech, publication, work, and life, clamoring about "four major unfreedoms."
    The delegates sternly refuted Xu Lingqing's various fallacies. Zhou Bingchen, the head of an agricultural cooperative in Yanjin County, said, "Although I am not a Communist Party member, I am currently serving as the head of the cooperative. Among the twenty-two production team leaders and higher-level cadres in our cooperative, only eight are Party members. How can it be said that agricultural cooperatives are all presided over by Party members?" Zhao Yuhe, the head of an agricultural cooperative in Suiping County, said, "I am a Party member cooperative head, but financial expenditures of five yuan or less in the cooperative require my approval; expenditures of more than ten yuan must be discussed and approved by the cooperative affairs committee or even the members' representative assembly." In the face of ironclad facts, Xu Lingqing had to admit that he had "distorted the facts."
    Guo Xiaotang, Vice President of Kaifeng Normal College, who attended the meeting as an observer, refuted Xu Lingqing's so-called "four major unfreedoms" one by one. It turned out that Xu Lingqing's claim of freedom of speech being restricted was due to his having been criticized for speaking on behalf of the landlord class. His claim of freedom of publication being restricted was because a "New Logic" he wrote, which contained serious errors, had been criticized in the People's Daily. His claim of work being unfree referred to the fact that he originally served as the Deputy Minister of the Cultural Department of the Central South Administrative Committee, and that coming to Henan to serve as the Deputy Director of the Education Department after the abolition of the greater administrative region was a "demotion." And his so-called lack of freedom in life was that he was deeply dissatisfied with the new society and therefore wanted to retreat to the mountains and live in seclusion, but with collectivization and land entering the cooperative, he "could not return even if he wanted to."

### 揭开“党的所有制”“四大不自由”的秘密  河南人代会驳倒许凌青

    揭开“党的所有制”“四大不自由”的秘密
    河南人代会驳倒许凌青
    本报讯　参加河南省人民代表大会的代表举出各种事实，严正地驳斥了右派分子许凌青的反共谰言。
    许凌青是河南省教育厅副厅长、省人民代表和政协委员。他污蔑说：“这几年来所有制改变了，但还不是社会主义所有制，而是党的所有制”，他的根据是“农业社都由党员主持”。他还造谣说党限制了他在言论、出版、工作、生活方面的自由，叫嚷“四大不自由”。
    代表们对许凌青的各种谬论进行了严正的驳斥。延津县农业社社长周炳臣说：“我虽然不是共产党员，可是我现在就担任着正社长的职务。我们全社二十二名生产队长以上的干部中，党员只有八名。这怎么能说农业社都是由党员主持的？”遂平县农业社社长赵玉合说：“我是个党员社长，但社里五元以下的财务开支才经我批准；十元以上的开支，都要经过社务委员会甚至社员代表大会讨论通过。”在铁一般的事实面前，许凌青只得承认他是“歪曲了事实”。
    列席会议的开封师范学院副院长郭晓棠，将许凌青所说的“四大不自由”逐条加以批驳。原来许凌青所说的言论不自由，是由于他曾代表地主阶级说话而受到过批评。他说出版不自由，是因为他写的一本有严重错误的“新逻辑学”，曾在人民日报上受到过批评。他的工作不自由是指他原来作中南行政委员会文化部副部长，大区撤销后到河南来，做教育厅副厅长是“降低职位”。而他所谓生活不自由，是他对新社会严重不满，因而想归隐山林过隐居生活，但是合作化了，土地入社，“欲归不得”。（新华社专稿）
