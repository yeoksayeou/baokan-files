Mao Shiying and Li Shiyu
　　Started Fires in the Supreme People's Procuratorate
    Attempted to Usurp Leadership of the Communist Party

This newspaper reports: During the anti-Rightist struggle, the Supreme People's Procuratorate exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Mao Shiying and Li Shiyu, members of the China Democratic League. They were loyal executors of the Zhang-Luo alliance's anti-Communist plan. Their attack on the Party's primary target was to seize the Party's leadership in the procuratorial organs.

Mao Shiying and Li Shiyu were the heads of the China Democratic League branch. At the start of the rectification movement, Mao Shiying everywhere touted that the situation had changed, planning to develop another branch or group within the Supreme People's Procuratorate to rival the Party.

They also convened meetings of League members under the guise of helping the Party rectify, mobilizing League members who had been disciplined during the Three-Anti Campaign to overturn their verdicts with the Party. At the meeting, it was also decided that the key points of attack against the Party would be cadre policy, personnel system, party-masses relations, and united front policy.

After the meeting, Mao Shiying actively started fires everywhere. More than fifty people were directly incited by her. Those she incited were mainly key targets in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, as well as others who harbored discontent towards the Party.

Li Shiyu slandered that the people's democratic dictatorship was a Communist Party dictatorship, and therefore he proposed: "Procurators should not be Communists." He also smeared veteran cadres as: having high positions, seniority, little talent, lacking virtue, and being incompetent, thus "hindering the development of productive forces," and should be "given certificates of merit and medals, and asked to retire and step down."

    毛士英李实育
　　曾在最高人民检察院点火
    打算篡夺共产党的领导权
    本报讯　最高人民检察院在反右派斗争中，揭露了民盟盟员毛士英和李实育的反动言行。他们是章罗联盟反共计划的忠实执行者。他们攻击党的主要目标，是要夺取检察机关党的领导权。
  毛士英和李实育是民盟支部的负责人，整风运动一开始，毛士英到处鼓吹什么现在形势变了，计划在高检院再发展一个支部或一个小组，以便同党分庭抗礼。
    他们还以帮助党整风为名召集盟员开会，动员在三反中受到处分的盟员向党翻案。会上还确定：向党攻击的重点是干部政策，人事制度，以及党群关系和统战政策。
    会议以后，毛士英即积极到处点火。直接受她煽动的有五十余人。她所煽动的对象主要是“三反”“肃反”中的重点对象以及其他对党怀有不满情绪的人。
    李实育则污蔑说，人民民主专政是共产党专政，因此他提出：“检察员不能由共产党员担任”。他还污蔑老干部是：职位高、资格老、少才、缺德又无能，因此“束缚了生产力发展”，应该“发给奖状奖章，请他们退休下台”。
