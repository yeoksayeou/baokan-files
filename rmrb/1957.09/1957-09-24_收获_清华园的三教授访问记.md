Harvest
A Record of Visits with Three Professors at Tsinghua Garden
By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng

The early autumn weather in Tsinghua Garden is still lush green, with ivy covering the building walls, and the school buildings are dotted among the green trees.

During the summer vacation, the campus seems very quiet, but the old professors who have just gone through the anti-Rightist struggle are in a fervent state of self-transformation due to the fiery tempering, and they are not so calm.

It was at this time that I visited three old professors in Tsinghua Garden.

One sunny morning, in the dazzling sunlight, I came to the professors' dormitory at Zhaolan Courtyard in Tsinghua Garden and visited Professor Zhang Zigao, who is seventy-one years old. In a quiet small living room, this white-haired old professor with more than forty years of teaching experience first told me that he had attended a vivid political lesson. He said that he was so old and had experienced so many things, but never had participating in the anti-Rightist struggle given him such a profound education. This fierce struggle on the political and ideological front made him deeply understand that life cannot be separated from politics.

From Not Caring About Politics to Caring

The old professor, smoking a cigarette, recounted his life with many emotions: For forty-one years, I have never left the teaching profession. Since returning from the United States in 1916, I have been single-mindedly wanting to contribute my efforts to education and burying myself in teaching my books well. Before liberation, although I didn't want to get involved in politics, the dark political atmosphere of the Kuomintang reactionaries suffocated people, and there were no good conditions for you to teach, and life was extremely difficult. This shows that not caring about politics is not an option.

Speaking of this, Professor Zhang Zigao said with great feeling: But after liberation, everything changed. The Party's arrangements for my work or care for my life were very touching. The Party has repeatedly encouraged me to study the history of Chinese chemistry and helped me establish the chemistry teaching and research group. Before last summer vacation, I developed dizziness, and several Party members and Youth League members in the teaching and research group took care of me, which moved me to tears. I deeply felt the warmth of the new society, which gave me such good teaching conditions. However, I still didn't care enough about politics.

At the beginning of this anti-Rightist struggle, my ideological understanding was still very vague. I was still holding onto sentimentalism. I always felt that these senior intellectuals were face-saving, so it was best not to embarrass these Rightists among senior intellectuals. But the facts educated me, the struggle educated me, and I realized that my thinking was completely wrong. From the large number of facts revealed by the masses and my personal participation in the struggle, I have a clearer understanding of the reactionary nature of the Rightists. They are already poisonous sores on the cause of socialism. Those poisonous sores are growing on us and have already hindered our actions. To maintain our health, we must cure these poisonous sores. To nurture evil is to invite disaster, which is absolutely not acceptable; throwing stones at rats but fearing breaking the dishes is also an overestimation. There should be absolutely no sentimentalism towards the Rightists, and only resolute struggle can completely crush their rampant attacks. In this great storm of struggle, I have once again received a good political training!

Professor Zhang Zigao talked about his ideological gains: In the struggle, he deeply felt that it is necessary to care about politics. Without correct political views, it is like having no soul, which is of more practical significance to him.

When I said I was going to visit Professor Liang Sicheng, he smiled and said to me that Professor Liang Sicheng must have felt even more than I did in this movement. Mr. Liang can not only write but is also very talkative!

Still Need to Carry Out Ideological Remolding

Walking through a tree-lined path, I came to Professor Liang Sicheng's home in Shengyin Courtyard. The architectural scholar's study window is covered with lush wisteria trellises. The study is unusually elegant, and the bookshelves are filled with books on architectural art from various countries, including a newly transcribed collection of poems by his late wife, Lin Huiyin.

Professor Liang Sicheng was very excited when he talked to me about the anti-Rightist struggle. He said that when the rectification movement first started, he saw articles or big-character posters like "Small Talk in the Flower Patch" by Professor Huang Wanli of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering. At that time, he only felt that the smell was a bit wrong, but his own understanding was still very vague at that time. He only felt that this way of criticizing by wiping out all the achievements was too much. But he couldn't see what these people were thinking when they gave opinions to the Party. When Chu Anping's fallacy of "The Party's World" was published, he only felt how could this person give opinions in this way! He simply couldn't see his reactionary nature from a political point of view. After the People's Daily published an editorial fighting back against the Rightists, he felt that his mind and eyes suddenly brightened, and he received great inspiration and strength. At this time, he understood that some people's rectification was not as simple and naive as he thought, but had ulterior motives. He said: "I felt extremely angry from the bottom of my heart. I felt how inadequate and slow my political level and political sense of smell were.

Professor Liang Sicheng said that at first he lacked powerful weapons to fight reasonably and convince people with reason, and he also lacked the experience of struggle, especially against the two-faced Rightists like Qian Weichang, he lacked the power to strike. But after reading the six political criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds pointed out by Chairman Mao, he found the sharpest weapon for conducting ideological struggle with the Rightists. In one battle after another, he gradually enriched his experience in struggle. During the most tense days of the struggle, people could often see him walking into this or that venue with a cane, launching a merciless verbal battle against the Rightists.

What power encouraged him to selflessly devote himself to this fierce anti-Rightist struggle? Professor Liang Sicheng recalled excitedly: That is because I received the Party's warmth and strength from the Party's care. Now that the Party is facing the attack of class enemies and facing the battle to fight back against the Rightists, although I am a novice on the battlefield, I love the Party that educated me, I love our socialism, and I cannot watch these guys attack our Party and people with my own eyes. So, encouraged by the struggles of workers and farmers, I resolutely stood on the front line of defending socialism and threw myself into the fierce anti-Rightist struggle to fight against the enemy.

He told me with excitement and emotion that an intellectual like me, who has not experienced any hardships and has not been tempered, and who has been cultivated in a greenhouse, has once again received a good training and test in this anti-Rightist struggle. My ideological gains are rich. In this practical struggle, I deeply realized the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism and strengthening ideological remolding. In the struggle, I attended a vivid political class on Marxism-Leninism, and I will continue to attend such political classes in the future!

Stand on the Proletarian Standpoint

When I went to visit the old professors of Tsinghua University, a member of the school's Party committee told me that in the struggle to defend the socialist direction of Tsinghua University and fight back against the Rightist Qian Weichang's conspiracy to usurp the leadership of Tsinghua University, Li Jixiang, an old professor of Tsinghua who was most familiar with Qian Weichang's personality, was one of the most powerful speakers in criticizing Qian Weichang's words and deeds.

When I found this old professor in the office of the head teacher of the old cadres class on the second floor of Jingzhai in Tsinghua, he was busy with the work of the old cadres class.

We started by talking about the anti-Rightist struggle. Professor Li Jixiang told me that in May, he sincerely gave several opinions to the Party with a warm and kind heart. At the same time, many abusive and attacking remarks against the Party suddenly appeared inside and outside the school. At that time, he only thought it was too extreme, and he still listened and watched with good intentions. He even thought, what does it matter if it is a bit extreme? But later, seeing that the situation was not right, the rumors were very rampant. At this time, he felt that his thoughts were a bit confused. He said: Although I felt dissatisfied and angry at the abusive and attacking remarks against the Party at that time, I was ultimately unable to identify the nature of these remarks. Therefore, in the face of this severe test, I did not immediately stand up and launch a resolute counterattack. It wasn't until I saw the worker and farmer brothers speak up that I woke up.

Then, he talked to me about the battle to criticize the Rightist Qian Weichang. He said: Through the Party's education, I have brightened my eyes. But due to the intellectual's sentimentalism, although I knew very well the personality of this Rightist Qian Weichang, who has always used two-faced tactics, and clearly saw his anti-Communist and anti-socialist face, when I faced him face to face in the struggle, I felt that I was still very lacking in experience and strength. But at this moment, the Party and comrades gave me unlimited fighting power. At the general meeting of teachers and students in the whole school to criticize Qian Weichang, I myself didn't know where the strength came from. I still went to the podium with illness that day. In front of the megaphone, I felt that my voice was very excited. After this battle, my combat experience has been enriched. I felt that I had received great training, not only could I distinguish many characteristics of the Rightists, but also knew how to use facts and reasoning to fight against the Rightists.

Speaking of this, Professor Li Jixiang said: In the past, I was engaged in teaching under the reactionary rule. Because I had not received care for many years, excessive fatigue caused me to get lung disease, and life was difficult, and it became more and more serious. If it were still in the past, I am afraid I would only have waited to die. Now the Party cares for me meticulously. I was sick in bed for more than a year. In recent years, I have been working half-time and resting half-time, but the school still takes care of me and encourages me in all aspects. My love and trust for the Party comes from many personal experiences. I love the Party, so I want to launch a struggle against the Rightists who oppose the Party.

He said excitedly that in this struggle, he had a relatively deep understanding of the class standpoint, especially. In the past, he also knew the term class standpoint abstractly, but he had never been actually tested. He himself has always been a professor teaching at the university, and the ideological feelings of intellectuals have not been well transformed. Through this practical struggle, he received a vivid Marxist-Leninist education and began to understand that standing firm on the proletarian standpoint is not just empty talk, but must be tested through practical struggle, and that Marxist ideology must be established.

I congratulated these old professors on their rich gains on the ideological front and wished them to strive for greater harvests.

At dusk, I left Tsinghua Garden.

    清华园的三教授访问记
    本报记者　柏生
    清秋天气，清华园里还是一片浓绿，爬墙虎遮满了楼墙，校舍点缀在绿树丛中。
    暑假中，校园里显得十分安静，可是刚刚经过反右派斗争的老教授们，火热的锻炼使他们心头沸腾着自我改造的思潮，却不是那么平静。
    就在这个时光，我访问了清华园里的三位老教授。
    一个晴朗的早上，在耀眼的阳光中，我来到清华园照澜院教授宿舍，访问了年高七十一龄的张子高老教授。在一间幽静的小客厅里，这位白发苍苍有着四十多年教学经验的老教授首先告诉我说，他上了一堂生动的政治课。他说，他年纪这样大了，经受的事情也比较多了，可是从来还没有像这次参加反右派斗争给他的教育这样深。这场激烈的政治思想战线上的斗争，使他深深地懂得了生活是不能脱离开政治的。
    从不关心政治到关心
    老教授一面吸着烟，一面感慨多端地回叙着自己的生活说：四十一年了，我没有离开过教书生活。自从1916年由美国归来以后，就一心想在教育岗位上贡献自己的一份力量，埋头教好自己的书。解放前，虽然不想过问政治，但是国民党反动派的黑暗政治空气却窒息得人喘不过气来，根本没有良好的条件给你教书，生活也极度艰难。这就说明不问政治是不行的。
    说到这里，张子高老教授很有感触地说：可是解放以后，一切都变了，党对我工作上的安排或是生活上的照顾，都是非常令人感动的。党曾屡次鼓励我把中国化学史的工作研究起来，并帮助我建立化学教研组的工作。去年暑假前，我发了头昏病，教研组好几位党员、团员在周围照顾我，使我感动得落了泪。我深深感到新社会的温暖，给了我这么好的教学条件。可是，我对政治的关心仍然是不够的。
    在这次反右派斗争开始时，我的思想认识还很模糊。还抱着温情主义。我总觉得这些高级知识分子都是爱面子的，因此对高级知识分子中的这些右派分子最好不必打破他们的面子。可是事实教育了我，斗争教育了我，我这种想法是完全错误的，从群众揭发的大量事实中，以及我亲身参加斗争的过程中，我比较清楚地认识了右派分子的反动本质。他们已是社会主义事业的毒疮。那种毒疮生在我们身上，已经对我们的行动发生了障碍，我们要保持健康，就必须把这毒疮治好。养痈贻患，是绝对不行的；投鼠忌器也是一种过虑。对右派分子是绝对不能温情的，只有进行坚决的斗争才能彻底打垮他们的猖狂进攻。在这场斗争的大风暴里，我又受到了一次很好的政治锻炼！
    张子高老教授谈起了他的思想收获说：在斗争中，他深深感到要关心政治，没有正确的政治观点就等于没有灵魂，这句话对他来说更具有现实意义。
    当我说要去访问梁思成教授时，他笑着对我说，梁思成教授在这次运动中一定比我感受的还要丰富，梁先生不但能写也很健谈呢！
    还要进行思想改造
    穿过一条林荫小径，我来到胜因院梁思成教授家里。这位建筑学家的书房窗外是浓荫的藤萝架，书房布置得异常雅致，书架上堆满了各国建筑艺术的书籍，其中还有一册他新近抄成的他已故的夫人林徽音的诗集。
    梁思成教授同我一谈起反右派斗争，就显得十分激动。他说，整风运动刚开始的时候，他看到水利系教授黄万里的“花丛小语”这一类的文章或大字报，当时他只感觉气味有些不对，可是那时他自己的认识还是很模糊的，只觉得这样把成绩一笔都抹杀的提意见方法，也未免太过分了。但究竟这些人是怀着什么心意来给党提意见，他根本没能看清。当储安平的“党天下”谬论发表时，他自己也只是感到这个人怎么用这种态度来提意见呢！根本没能从政治上来看清他的反动本质。人民日报发出了反击右派的社论以后，他感到自己的头脑和眼睛都忽然豁亮起来，得到了很大的启发和力量。这时他才明白了有些人对整风并不是像他所想的那么简单那么天真了，而是别有用心的。他说：“我从内心里感到无比的愤怒，我感到自己的政治水平和政治嗅觉是多么不够，多么迟钝。
    梁思成教授说，最初他对怎样据理斗争，以理服人还很缺乏有力的武器，又缺少斗争的经验，尤其像是对钱伟长这样两面派的右派分子，更缺乏打击的力量。但是读了毛主席所指出的六项辨别香花毒草的政治标准以后，他找到了和右派分子进行思想斗争的最锐利的武器。在一次接连一次的战斗中，他也逐渐丰富了斗争的经验。斗争进行得最紧张的那些日子里，人们经常可以看到他拄着一根拐杖走进了这里或那里的会场，向右派分子展开了无情的舌战。
    是什么力量鼓舞着他忘我地投入到这场激烈的反右派斗争中去的呢？梁思成教授兴奋地回溯着说：那就是我从党的关怀里得到了党的温暖和力量。现在党面临着阶级敌人的进攻，面临着反击右派的战斗，我虽然是战场上的一个新手，可是我热爱教育了我的党，我热爱我们的社会主义，我不能亲眼看着这些家伙攻击我们的党和人民，于是在工人、农民的战斗的鼓舞下，我毅然地站到保卫社会主义的战线上，投入到激烈地反右派斗争中和敌人去作战。
    他满怀着兴奋和感动的心情告诉我说，像我这样的没有经过什么风霜，没有受过什么锻炼的一个由温室里培养出来的知识分子，在这次反右派斗争中又受到了一次很好的锻炼和考验。我的思想收获是丰富的。在这场实际斗争中，使我深深地认识到学习马列主义，加强思想改造的重要意义。我在斗争中，上了一堂生动的马列主义的政治大课，以后还要不断上这样的政治大课呢！
    站到无产阶级立场上
    当我去访问清华大学的老教授们时，学校的一位党委委员曾告诉我，在保卫清华大学的社会主义方向，反击右派分子钱伟长阴谋篡夺清华大学领导权的斗争中，有一位最熟悉钱伟长为人的清华老教授李辑祥，在批驳钱伟长的言行中，他是说理最有力的一个。
    当我在清华静斋二楼的老干部班主任办公室找到这位老教授时，他正在忙着老干部班的工作。
    我们一开始便谈起了反右派斗争。李辑祥教授告诉我，5月中，他怀着一颗热情善良的心愿，诚恳地向党提出了几点意见。也就在这个时候，校内外忽然出现了许多谩骂攻击党的言论。当时他只认为太偏激，还是怀着好心肠来听来看，甚至还想，就是偏激一些，又有什么关系呢？可是后来，看看形势不对头了，流言蜚语，甚为嚣张。这时他感到自己的思想有些混乱起来。他说：虽然那时我对谩骂和攻击党的言论，感到不满和愤怒，但是我究竟没能识别出这些言论的性质。因此，在这个严重的考验面前，我没有立刻起来坚决展开反击。直到看到工人、农民兄弟都说了话，我才清醒过来。
    接着，他和我谈起了批判右派分子钱伟长的战斗。他说：经过党的教育，我已擦亮了眼睛。但是由于知识分子的温情主义思想，虽然我很了解这个一贯使用两面派手法的右派分子钱伟长的为人，也清楚地看到了他反共反社会主义的面貌，但当我面对面地和他进行斗争时，我感到自己还十分缺乏经验和力量。可是就在这时，党和同志们给了我无限战斗的力量。在全校师生批判钱伟长的大会上，我自己也不知道是那来的一股力量，那天我还是带病走上讲台的。在扩音器前，我感到自己说话的声音很激动。经过这次战斗，我的战斗经验丰富了。我觉得自己受到了很大的锻炼，不但能分辨出右派分子的许多特点来，而且懂得怎样用事实和说理的方法，据理和右派分子展开斗争了。
    谈到这里，李辑祥老教授说：过去我在反动统治下搞教学工作，因多年来得不到照顾，过分的劳累使我得了肺病，生活困难，愈来愈重。如果还是在过去，恐怕只有等死了。现在党对我无微不至的关怀。我有一年多病在床上，最近这几年我都是半工作半休养，可是学校还是从各方面照顾我、鼓励我。我对党的热爱和信任是从许多亲切的体会中感受到的。我爱党，所以要向反对党的右派分子展开斗争。
    他兴奋地说，他在这次斗争中，特别是对阶级立场有了比较深刻的体会，以前他也抽象地知道阶级立场这个名词，但总没有实际受到考验。他自己一直都是在大学里做教授教书，知识分子的思想感情没有受到很好的改造。通过这一次实际斗争，使他受到了一场生动的马列主义教育，开始了解要站稳无产阶级立场，不是一句空话，而是要经过实际斗争的检验，要树立马克思主义的思想。
    我祝贺这些老教授们在思想战线上取得丰富的收获，并且预祝他们争取更大的丰收。
    黄昏时分，我离开了清华园。
