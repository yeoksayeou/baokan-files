    Struggle Deepens in Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio
    Two Rightist Cliques Collapse
    (Our dispatch) The anti-Rightist struggle is deepening at the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. After more than a month of reasoned debate, the rightist clique headed by assistant director Shi Liting and the rightist clique masterminded by technician Meng Qingbin have been exposed. In addition, the ugly face of the Communist Party member and rightist Li Yuan has also been revealed.
    Assistant director Shi Liting colluded with Duan Zhongchen and others to form an anti-Communist clique. Shi Liting, the leader of the clique, openly demanded that the studio's editor-in-chief resign and step down. Duan Zhongchen, the "theoretician" of the clique, used Chu Anping's fallacies to attribute all the shortcomings in the studio to sectarianism. They declared: "If sectarianism is not broken, the rectification movement in the studio will not be victorious"; "We must carry it through to the end. Now it's either the leadership or me; if there's me, there's no leadership."
    Another rightist clique, which called itself the "Voluntary Combination Group," originated in the film developing workshop, with technician Meng Qingbin as the mastermind, film developers Tian Shutan and Lin Youfu as the "commanders," and material clerk Zhang Chongjie as the "strategist." This clique openly put forward a sensational program: first, to drive away the deputy director of the workshop who was a Party member; second, to bring down the core group (a leading group composed of representatives from the workshop's Party, government, labor union). After several secret meetings, they decided to win over "those who had the most opinions about the leadership" and the so-called "rightists in the Communist Youth League" to form the "Voluntary Combination Group," excluding progressive elements among Party members and League members. At dawn on June 4, the backbone of this clique openly posted a declaration of establishment in the form of a big-character poster, fabricating that the group had been "approved" by the studio leadership, in order to deceive the masses, expand into a large group claiming to have sixty members, and attempt to organize a "democratic party" or "opposition party" to confront the Party.
    The anti-Party element Li Yuan rolled over to the position of the rightists from the very beginning of the rectification movement in the studio. He said: "If I can't do good things, can't I curse the streets? I must fight them (referring to the leadership) to the end!"
    After exposure and struggle by the studio's staff, the above-mentioned cliques have disintegrated. The deceived masses have awakened and turned around to expose the reactionary words and deeds of those backbone elements.

    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂斗争深入
    两个右派集团崩溃
    本报讯  中央新闻纪录电影制片厂反右派斗争正深入开展。经过一个多月说理斗争，以副导演拾立廷为首的右派小集团和以技师孟庆彬为幕后指挥者的右派小集团，已被揭发出来。另外，还揭发了党员右派分子李元的丑恶面貌。
    副导演拾立廷同段中琛等结成反共小集团。小集团首领拾立廷公开要挟制片厂总编辑辞职下台；小集团“理论家”段中琛则运用储安平的谬论，把厂内一切缺点都归结为宗派主义。他们扬言：“不攻破宗派主义，厂内的整风就不会胜利”；“一定要干到底，现在是有领导就没有我，有我就没有领导。”
    另一右派小集团自命名为“自愿结合小组”，它产生于洗印工作间，以技师孟庆彬为幕后指挥，洗片员田树坛、林有福为“司令官”，材料员张重杰为“军师”。这一小集团公开提出煽动性的纲领：一、赶走工作间党员副主任；二、搞垮核心组（由工作间党政工团代表组成的领导小组）。他们在进行多次密谋之后，决定拉拢“对领导意见最多的人”和所谓“青年团右派”，组成“自愿结合小组”，排斥党员和团员中的进步分子。6月4日拂晓，这个小集团骨干公然以大字报的形式张贴出成立宣言，捏造该组已经厂领导“批准”，借以蒙骗群众，扩张成号称六十人的大组，并企图组织“民主党”或“反对党”，与党分庭抗礼。
    反党分子李元在该厂整风一开始就滚到右派分子的立场上去。他说：“好事干不了，骂街还不行吗？我非和他们（指领导）干到底不可！”
    上述小集团经该厂职工揭发和斗争后，已土崩瓦解，被蒙骗的群众纷纷觉悟，反过来揭发那些骨干分子的反动言行。
