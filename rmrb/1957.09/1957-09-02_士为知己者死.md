    “A Scholar Dies for His Patron”
    Tang Tao
    The feudal society has long ended, but there are still people who yearn for that life. As the ancestor of intellectuals, Confucius spent his life restlessly, traveling around in a large cart, hoping to find a like-minded master to promote his ideas. The journey was naturally arduous, and perhaps because he was Confucius, he could still adhere to the principle of "stay if we agree, leave if we disagree" in his search for a "patron." In the later stages, scholars—the so-called intellectuals—finally degenerated into hangers-on, chasing after fame and fortune, shifting allegiances frequently, their only goal being to get food. At this time, the philosophy of "whoever gives milk is my mother" rose to prominence, but there was also a more elegant term for it: "A scholar is employed by his patron." This gave ambitious people room to maneuver and soar.
    Today's right-wing group understands this philosophy very well. The crow Xu Zhongnian said, "Treat me as a national talent, and I will repay you as a national talent," which is precisely the meaning of waiting for a good price to sell oneself. Chen Qixia of the Ding-Chen group went even further, changing "a scholar is employed by his patron" to "a scholar dies for his patron." From his own perspective, it means I die for others; from the perspective of those he summons, it means others die for me. Die for what? He says: Die for the "patron"; who is "known"? I think it's at most like Cai Yong crying for Dong Zhuo in history, only because Dong Zhuo had given him a little favor. This is a completely feudal relationship, but unexpectedly it has become a classic followed by the Communist Party member Chen Qixia!
    As a proletarian fighter, one should not be afraid of death, but one can only die for the truth of the class. Li Dazhao, Fang Zhimin, Huang Jiguang, and Dong Cunrui all sacrificed their lives in this way. What reason does Chen Qixia have to die for Ding Ling? What right does the Ding-Chen anti-Party group have to demand that others die for them? Under the restless stirring of the insatiable bourgeois personal ambition, through a little hypocritical "comfort," they want to exchange for other people's lives. This is not called "knowing each other," but a bourgeois business with a huge profit on a small investment. Some people are still shouting, "A scholar can be killed but not humiliated." In my opinion, just on this point alone, they have already been "humiliated" enough.
    Bourgeois intellectuals inherently have the problem of "seeing the tip of an autumn hair but not a cartload of firewood." The so-called "autumn hair" is actually just their personal "autumn hair." Even a crease in their clothes, if it touches their skin, will feel like a thorn in their back, causing discomfort from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, they can never let go of, forget, or get rid of many personal problems. Ding Ling is the most adept at using this to win people's hearts. Do you feel that there is too much administrative work and not enough time to write, and you are a little annoyed? She would say, "What does it matter how much work you do now? Writing is what's yours." Do you feel you haven't been able to write anything for a long time, and you are infinitely distressed and panicking? She would come to advocate "one-bookism," saying, "As long as you write one book, no one can defeat you." Exploiting people's weaknesses and pandering to people's desires, this is the "skill" of the Ding-Chen group. And indeed, some people have forgotten the Party's cultivation of them, and from this a feeling of "knowing each other" arises. They consider Ding Ling and Chen Qixia to be like-minded comrades, fall into their trap, and become the group's "die-hard followers." Because intellectuals' lives are already guaranteed today, these people may not really become hangers-on under Ding and Chen, but in the spiritual realm, they have indeed shared a piece of the bourgeois individualism pie and swallowed it comfortably.
    This is the essence of the so-called "a scholar dies for his patron."
    Are there really such "die-hard followers"? Under the shining light of proletarian thought, the spirit of collectivism is bound to triumph. The fur of the intellectuals must be attached to the body of the proletariat. The Party is the true patron of every individual. August 26th night.

    “士为知己者死”
    唐弢
    封建社会早已结束了，然而也还有人留恋着那时候的生活。作为知识分子的祖宗，孔老夫子一生栖栖皇皇，坐着大车到处奔走，希望找到一个情投意合的主子，好推行自己的主张。风尘仆仆，辛苦自然是辛苦的，也许就因为是孔老夫子的缘故吧，在寻觅“知己”之际，毕竟还能抱着“合则留，不合则去”的原则。到了末流，士——所谓知识分子也者，终于沦为食客，逐臭寻膻，朝秦暮楚，其目的只在于啖饭，谈不到什么远大的理想了。这时候，“有乳便是娘”的哲学便抬起头来，但也还有一个比较文雅的名词，叫做：“士为知己者用”。于此野心家也就有了回旋翱翔的地盘。
    今天的右派集团是很懂得这套哲学的。乌鸦徐仲年说：“人以国士待我，我以国士报之”，正是待善价而沽的意思。丁陈集团里的陈企霞还要进一步，改“士为知己者用”为“士为知己者死”，从他自己的角度说，是我为人死；从他所召号的对象说，是人为我死。死什么呢？曰：死“知己”；所“知”者何？我看顶多像历史上蔡邕哭董卓一样，只为董卓对他有过一点小恩小惠而已。这是十足的封建社会的关系，不料竟成了共产党员陈企霞所奉行的经典！
    作为无产阶级的战士，不应该怕死，然而却只能为阶级的真理而死。李大钊、方志敏、黄继光、董存瑞都是这样献出了自己的生命的。陈企霞有什么理由要为丁玲去死？丁陈反党集团又有什么权利来要求别人为他们而死？在永无餍足的资产阶级个人野心的蠢动下，通过一点假仁假义的“抚慰”，就要换取别人的生命，这不叫做“知己”，而是资产阶级一本万利的“生意经”。有人还在高叫什么“士可杀而不可辱”，据我看来，单就这一点而论，也已经被“辱”得很够了。
    资产阶级知识分子本来就有“明察秋毫，而不见舆薪”的毛病，所谓“秋毫”，实际上只是他个人的“秋毫”，即使是衣服上的一个折缝，一着了肉，也会觉得如芒刺在背，从心底里感到不舒服。因此对于许多个人问题，终是撒不开，忘不掉，洒不脱。丁玲就是最善于从这种地方来笼络人心的。你觉得行政工作太多，没有时间写作，心里正有点烦厌吗？她就说：“你现在不管做多少工作都算得什么呢？写东西才是自己的。”你觉得很久写不出东西，有无限苦闷，心里正在着慌吗？她就来提倡“一本书主义”，说：“只要你写出一本书，谁也打不倒你。”逢人之恶，阿人所好，这就是丁陈集团的“本领”。而且也的确有些人，忘记了党对他们的培养，从这里产生“知己”之感，引丁玲、陈企霞为同调，堕入彀中，成为这个集团的“死党”。由于今天知识分子的生活已经得到保障，这些人虽然不至于真的去当丁陈门下的食客，但在精神领域内，却的确分到了资产阶级个人主义的一杯羹，舒舒服服地咽下肚去了。
    这就是所谓“士为知己者死”的实质。
    果真有这样的“死党”吗？在无产阶级思想光辉照耀下，集体主义的精神是一定要胜利的，知识分子的毛必须依附在无产阶级的身上，党，才是每一个人的真正的知己。  8月26日夜。
