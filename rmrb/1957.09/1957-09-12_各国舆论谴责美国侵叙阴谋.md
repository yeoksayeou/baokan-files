Reports from Various Countries:

　　Soviet Union
    Moscow Dispatch: "Pravda" wrote on September 9th: The interference of the American colonialist bloc in the internal affairs of Near Eastern countries is making the situation in this region increasingly tense.
    The newspaper pointed out that after the failure of the provocative conspiracy against independent and autonomous Syria organized by the American spy agencies, the American imperialists have not stopped their conspiracies. They are using all means to try to force this country to abandon its independent policy.
    "Pravda" wrote that the actions of the Eastern countries that have joined the Baghdad Pact will clear the way for American occupation troops and create excuses for direct American intervention. The adventurous organizers are hoping that the "allies" in the East will pull chestnuts out of the fire for them, and they are inciting these "allies" against Syria for this purpose today. But everyone knows that playing with fire is dangerous. The leaders of those countries that are adopting military threats are concentrating troops on the Syrian border, apparently forgetting that this policy will not bring them glory and victory, and that this policy orientation is contrary to the fundamental interests of their own country. However, it should be believed that in Turkey and other countries, calm consideration of national interests will overcome shortsighted plans.
　　Lebanon
    Beirut Dispatch: On the 9th, "Al-Akhbar" wrote in an editorial entitled "The United States Intends to Turn Jordan into a Base for Attacking Syria" that the United States is trying with all its strength and methods to change Syria's national system and establish a reactionary rule in Syria.
    The newspaper wrote that the United States has decided to arm Jordan and establish an "air bridge" to quickly supply Jordan with heavy weapons.
    The newspaper wrote that this situation "makes us clearly see that the United States, using the pretext that the Syrian situation threatens neighboring Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, and Turkey, intends to carry out armed aggression against Syria. The supply of weapons clearly proves this."
    The newspaper emphasized that if the imperialists attack Syria, all Arabs from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf will unite against the aggressors.
　　Libya
    Tripoli Dispatch: The Libyan "Al-Umma" published an article on the 9th condemning the United States for interfering in Syria's internal affairs. It said, "The United States is trying to destroy the achievements of the Syrian people and make them regress to the colonial era through its embassy in Damascus."
    The magazine wrote: "World public opinion, especially Arab public opinion, has now clearly seen the true intentions of the United States towards Arab countries. They see that the United States' diplomatic activities in the Near East have gone bankrupt, so the United States has begun to take measures such as plotting conspiracies and coups, attempting to use force to force the people of this region to accept its policies. The failure of the United States' conspiracy activities in Syria has produced a huge reaction among people from all walks of life in the Arab world. Today, the United States has abandoned its mask. The United States violates international law and the UN Charter, and rudely interferes in the internal affairs of other countries."
　　England
    London dispatch: Labor MP Crossman said in the "Daily Mirror" on the 11th that President Eisenhower is currently heading towards a disaster in the Middle East.
    Crossman said that Eisenhower is trying to restore his damaged prestige in the Arab world with the threat of military intervention and demonstrations of military strength. However, Crossman said, "Before President Eisenhower irrevocably plunges into this gamble, he should recall the fate of Sir Eden and think twice."
    Crossman believes that the United States and the British government should not treat the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a four-nation conference to discuss the Middle East issue with military threats, but should sit down at the conference table while it is not too late.
    Many political figures in Britain share Crossman's views.
    Labor's "Shadow Cabinet" Foreign Secretary Bevan said at a press conference in Warsaw yesterday that implementing the Eisenhower Doctrine could cause a third world war. He also emphasized that the Middle East issue cannot be resolved without cooperation with the Soviet Union.

### 各国舆论谴责美国侵叙阴谋

　　各国舆论谴责美国侵叙阴谋
　　苏联
    本报综合报道：莫斯科消息：“真理报”9月9日写道：美国殖民主义集团对近东国家内政的干涉，使得这个地区的局势日趋紧张。
    这家报纸指出，由美国间谍机关所组织的反对独立自主的叙利亚的挑衅阴谋遭到失败以后，美国帝国主义者并没有停止他们的阴谋，他们用尽一切手段想迫使这个国家放弃独立政策。
    “真理报”写道，加入巴格达条约的东方国家的行动，将为美国占领军扫清道路，替美国的直接干涉制造借口。冒险组织者指望东方的“盟国”为他们火中取栗，他们今天就是本着这个目的嗾使这些“盟国”反对叙利亚。但是大家知道，玩火必伤身。那些采取军事威胁的国家的领导人把军队集结在叙利亚边境，显然忘记了这种政策并不会给他们带来光荣和胜利，这种政策方针是违背他们本国的根本利益的。但是，应当认为，在土耳其和其他国家中，对国家利益的冷静考虑会战胜没有远见的打算。
　　黎巴嫩
    贝鲁特消息　9日“消息报”在一篇题为“美国打算把约旦变成进攻叙利亚的基地”的社论中写道，美国企图用一切力量和方法改变叙利亚的国家制度和在叙利亚建立反动统治。
    报纸写道，美国决定武装约旦，建立“空中桥梁”火速供应约旦重武器。
    报纸写道，这种情况“使我们清醒地看出，美国以叙利亚局势威胁到邻国伊拉克、约旦、以色列、黎巴嫩以及土耳其为借口，打算对叙利亚进行武装侵略。供应武器明显地证明了这一点。”
    报纸强调指出，如果帝国主义者进攻叙利亚，从大西洋到波斯湾的全体阿拉伯人将一致起来反对侵略者。
　　利比亚
    的黎波里消息：利比亚“国家报”9日发表文章谴责美国干涉叙利亚内政。它说，“美国企图通过驻大马士革大使馆毁灭叙利亚人民的成就，使他们退向殖民地时代。”
    这家杂志写道：“整个世界舆论，特别是阿拉伯舆论现在都已经看清楚了美国对阿拉伯国家的真正意图。它们看到，美国在近东的外交活动已经破产了，因此美国开始采取像策划阴谋和政变这样的措施，企图用武力来迫使这个地区的人民接受它的政策。美国在叙利亚的阴谋活动的失败在阿拉伯各界人士中产生了巨大的反响。今天，美国已经抛弃了假面具。美国违反国际法准则和联合国宪章，粗暴地干涉其他国家的内政”。
　　英国
    伦敦讯：工党议员克罗斯曼11日在“每日镜报”上说，艾森豪威尔总统目前正在走向中东的灾难。
    克罗斯曼说，艾森豪威尔企图用军事干涉的威胁和军事实力的示威来恢复他在阿拉伯世界已经遭到损伤的威信。但是，克罗斯曼说，“在艾森豪威尔总统无可挽回地投入这场赌博以前，他应当回忆艾登爵士的命运并且三思而后行。”
    克罗斯曼认为，美国和英国政府不应当用军事威胁来对待苏联主张举行四国会议讨论中东问题的建议，而应当趁现在还不算太晚的时候坐到会议桌旁来。
    英国许多政界人士都同克罗斯曼抱有同样的看法。
    工党“影子内阁”外交大臣比万昨天在华沙的记者招待会上说，实行艾森豪威尔主义可能引起第三次世界大战。他并且强调指出，除非同苏联合作，否则就不可能解决中东问题。
