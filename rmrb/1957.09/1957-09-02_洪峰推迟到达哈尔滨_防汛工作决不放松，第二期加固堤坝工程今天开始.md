Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 1st. Lü Qien, the chief commander of Harbin's flood prevention efforts and mayor of the city, comprehensively analyzed the flood control situation in Harbin at an emergency city-wide flood prevention meeting today. Lü Qien said that at 6:00 PM today, the water level of the river in Harbin dropped to 119.99 meters, a decrease of four centimeters from yesterday's peak water level of 120.03 meters. The sudden drop in water level is due to temporary setbacks caused by levee breaches in individual upstream areas before the arrival of the major flood peak. It is estimated that the extraordinarily large flood formed by the confluence of the second Songhua River and Nen River flood peaks will be delayed in reaching Harbin. Lü Qien called on all flood prevention personnel to use this time to raise the levees and make all necessary preparations.
    The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Flood Prevention Headquarters decided at a joint meeting today to begin the second phase of the embankment reinforcement project starting tomorrow.

    洪峰推迟到达哈尔滨
    防汛工作决不放松，第二期加固堤坝工程今天开始
    据新华社哈尔滨1日电  哈尔滨市防汛总指挥、市长吕其恩，今天在全市紧急防汛会议上全面分析了哈尔滨市防洪斗争的形势。吕其恩说，今天下午六时，哈尔滨市江面水位降到一百一十九点九九公尺，比昨天的最高水位一百二十点零三公尺下降了四公分。水势突然下降，是由于大洪峰来临前上流个别地区发生了溃堤现象而暂时回落。估计第二松花江和嫩江两股洪峰汇合而成的特大洪水，将推迟到达哈尔滨。吕其恩号召全体防汛人员要利用这段时间加高堤防，做好一切准备工作。
    中共哈尔滨市委和防汛指挥部在今天的联席会议上决定从明天起，开始第二期加固堤坝工程。
