    "A Room with Two Books" and "A Cup of Tea and a Cigarette"
    ·Lu·
    Bourgeois rightist Fei Xiaotong said he wanted "a room with two books" so he could do his work quietly. Zhu Shengfu, a political theory teacher at Tsinghua University, added that he wanted to add "a cup of tea and a cigarette."
    At first glance, their ideas seem so "wonderful"! But they themselves do not actually live like this. They are a small group of ambitious people who are constantly running around, plotting in secret rooms,妄想to abolish the Party's leadership and restore capitalism.
    So, why do they make such propaganda? They understand the characteristics of intellectual's individual labor. In order to cater to the psychology of some old intellectuals, they put forward these slogans, the purpose of which is to prompt them to leave the socialist road and weaken and interrupt the connection between intellectuals and workers and peasants.
    Imagine, what can be produced by hiding in "a room" to do homework? Only intellectuals who are divorced from actual struggle can be cultivated.
    Our country must cultivate and establish a strong contingent of working-class intellectuals, which is a task that history has presented to us. It has not only become possible, but also a reality, for workers to leave their lathes and peasants to leave their hoes and enter universities in our country. We must strive to cultivate a new contingent of intellectuals for a long time, but if the old intellectuals can get out of "a room" and go to the mass struggle, combine theory with practice, take life and struggle as living books, integrate with workers and peasants, and cultivate the class feelings of the working people, they can also gradually transform themselves into working-class intellectuals. Such intellectuals are also welcomed by the people of the whole country.

### “一间房两本书”和“一杯茶一支烟”

    “一间房两本书”和“一杯茶一支烟”
    ·路·
    资产阶级右派分子费孝通说，要“一间房，两本书”，好安安静静地做功课。清华大学一个政治理论课教师朱声绂接上去说，要加上“一杯茶、一支烟”。
    乍看起来，他们设想得多“美妙”啊！可是他们自己就并不是真正地这样的生活着。他们是一小撮野心家，经常奔走四方，策划于密室，妄想取消党的领导，使资本主义复辟。
    那末，他们为什么又作如斯宣传呢？他们懂得知识分子的个体劳动特点，为迎合某些旧知识分子的心理，提出了这些口号，其目的只是想促使他们离开社会主义道路，削弱和打断知识分子同工人、农民的联系。
    试想，躲在“一间房”里做功课，能做出什么来呢？只能培养出脱离实际斗争的知识分子。
    我国必须培养和建立一支强大的工人阶级知识分子的队伍，这是历史向我们提出的任务。工人离开车床，农民离开锄犁而进大学，在我国不但已经有了可能，而且成为事实。我们要努力长期培养新的知识分子队伍，但是旧的知识分子如果能走出“一间房”，到群众斗争中去，使理论与实践相结合，把生活和斗争当作活书本，同工人、农民打成一片，培养劳动人民的阶级感情，也能逐步改造自己成为工人阶级知识分子。这种知识分子，也是全国人民所欢迎的。
