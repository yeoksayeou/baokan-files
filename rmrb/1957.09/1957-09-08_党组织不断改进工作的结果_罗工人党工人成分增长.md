    The article stated that in recent years, the vast majority of new party members developed by the Workers' Party have been the most outstanding workers.

    党组织不断改进工作的结果
    罗工人党工人成分增长
    据新华社布加勒斯特7日电 “火花报”9月6日发表了罗马尼亚工人党中央组织部副部长巴洛斯的一篇文章，论述工人党党员中的工人成分增长的情况。
    文章说，近年来工人党所发展的新党员中绝大部分都是最优秀的工人。普罗什蒂州去年发展的三千五百多名新党员以及今年5、6两月发展的一千五百多名新党员中，工人占83.6％。其他一些州的情况也跟这个州差不多。这种成就是党组织不断改进工作的结果。
    罗马尼亚工人党在1955年底的时候，拥有五十九万五千三百九十八名党员和候补党员，其中工农成分占62％。
