Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Over the past two months, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, through more than thirty large and small meetings of reasoned struggle, has refuted Lu Qin Fan, a rightist element and a third-grade researcher in the academy who, under the guise of "population issues," attempted to stir up a "Hungarian incident" in our country. In the three days since the 5th, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences has held three consecutive afternoon mass rallies of the entire academy to conduct a comprehensive and systematic criticism and exposure of Lu Qin Fan's anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.

Just as the rightist elements were frantically attacking the Party, Lu Qin Fan spent more than 300 yuan to print 10,000 copies of his own extremely absurd and reactionary booklet, "Population Problem: A Collection of Bricks to Attract Jade," and sent them to the National People's Congress, attempting to distribute them to all parts of the country to incite trouble. In this booklet, Lu Qin Fan described the new society as a complete mess. He slandered the new society, saying, "Before liberation, three people's food was eaten by five people; now that life has improved, four people's food is eaten by eight people." He also said, "People replace livestock in pulling plows, tragically reducing labor productivity." He falsely claimed that China's resources were scarce and that the population problem was the fundamental contradiction in the current socialist construction. After distorting the seriousness of China's "surplus" population, he said, "If I were Chiang Kai-shek or Dulles, I would hope that every woman on the mainland between the ages of fifteen and fifty would give birth to one child every year. In less than a year, disturbances on a scale larger than the Hungarian incident would occur in our country. Although this hypothetical extreme situation is only allegorical, I hope that literary workers, in this spring of a hundred flowers blooming, can draw material from this and write about how dissatisfied masses of mothers are, smashing hospitals, smashing milk farms, smashing trade unions to demand welfare, etc. This is the first stage. Then parents will smash schools to demand that their children be admitted, urban youths will smash factories to demand employment, rural youths will leave cooperatives because they cannot expand their cultivated land area, and even livestock will demand feed land to raise calves and foals, etc." At the meeting, the masses refuted Lu Qin Fan's Malthusian population theory and exposed that Lu Qin Fan was pretending to be worried about the so-called "overpopulation," but in essence, he was attempting to stir up a "Hungarian incident" in our country.

At the meeting, the masses refuted one by one Lu Qin Fan's other destructive and inflammatory reactionary remarks made under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work. Lu Qin Fan openly demanded the resignation of Chen Fengtong, the deputy dean of the academy who was a Party member. He viciously said that "not finding the old monk" would not work. Like Chu Anping, he slandered that the Premier of the State Council were all Party members and that this was sectarianism; he smeared the Communist Party as having "become a power group," viciously saying that the Communist Party was "hereditary" and "even more feudal than private land ownership"; he cursed the Party, saying that it would "ultimately be abandoned by the wheels of the times." He cursed Party members as "sitting in sedan chairs" and having others carry them, as being "Empress Dowager Cixi," and slandered that "the vast majority of Party members are bad," shouting, "Party members quickly get out of the sedan chair."

Critics at the meeting exposed Lu Qin Fan's five steps to oppose communism and socialism and plot the restoration of capitalism: The first step was to fabricate rumors to provoke discord between the Party and the masses; the second step was to fabricate an atmosphere of "tense population problems" and call on the masses to quarrel with the Party leaders, attempting to stir up a "Hungarian incident"; the third step was to demand that landlords and capitalists usurp political power to achieve the sinister goal of capitalist restoration.

Lu Qin Fan, who came from a capitalist family, was a consistently anti-communist and anti-socialist, extremely stubborn, and rampant rightist element. After the anti-rightist struggle began, when the masses refuted his anti-communist and anti-socialist fallacies, he posted big-character posters to resist and quibble one by one. Whoever criticized him, he would argue with, his attitude was very unreasonable, and he vainly hoped to suppress the critics. Later, when he saw that the situation was not good, he shouted, "I want to withdraw from the rectification," and declared that he would no longer attend meetings, read big-character posters, or subscribe to the People's Daily, and stayed at home, attempting to escape the struggle. At the same time, he announced to others, "I am prepared to be exiled, I will not starve to death..." When the masses went to his office to ask him to participate in the debate, he dared to tell the masses to "get out!" and tried to push the masses out of the door. He also stuffed cotton in his ears to avoid listening to others' advice, playing a rogue attitude. After being severely refuted by the masses, he had to participate in the debate. After many reasoned struggles and the exposure of a large amount of material, Lu Qin Fan's sinister face became increasingly clearly exposed to the masses. At the beginning of the struggle, some of the masses thought that it was a problem of ideology, but at this time, most of the masses brightened their eyes, raised their awareness, and actively participated in the struggle. Those who were close to Lu Qin Fan and Lu Qin Fan's old classmates also stood up to join the battle. After the masses concentrated their efforts to expose and refute, Lu Qin Fan, who had always refused to admit his mistakes, finally began to bow his head, and his arrogant arrogance had been defeated. The masses' fighting spirit became even higher. Many people drew dozens of charts marking the achievements of the new China in various production and construction, and posted them on the walls of the venue, focusing on breaking through Lu Qin Fan's trump card – the "Population Problem: A Collection of Bricks to Attract Jade." As a result, Lu Qin Fan had to admit some of his reactionary words and deeds, but he still insisted that his motives were good. The stubborn resistance of the rightist elements aroused the flames of the masses' anger. Everyone felt that there were too few opportunities to speak at the general meeting, and they asked to have small meetings with Lu Qin Fan, to engage in close combat, asking and answering, face-to-face debate. The masses lined up the basic arguments of the "Population Problem: A Collection of Bricks to Attract Jade," assigned the preparation of opinions, and debated with Lu Qin Fan. In this way, after a long, in-depth, and mass-based debate, Lu Qin Fan had to admit recently that he subjectively had anti-communist emotions, which led to anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks. However, the masses believed that his confession was still not honest or thorough enough.

At this plenary session of the academy, more than thirty people spoke to criticize Lu Qin Fan. There were also more than sixty people who had written speeches but did not have the opportunity to speak at the meeting. A large number of masses who did not get the opportunity to speak used big-character posters to express their opinions and anger.

The Academy of Agricultural Sciences will continue to struggle against Lu Qin Fan.

### 坚决斗争凶恶猖狂的右派分子  农业科学院驳倒陆钦范  把右派论点进行排队，分工研究，充分准备，一一批驳

    坚决斗争凶恶猖狂的右派分子
    农业科学院驳倒陆钦范
    把右派论点进行排队，分工研究，充分准备，一一批驳
    据新华社7日讯　农业科学院两个多月来经过三十多次大小会议的说理斗争，驳倒了这个院的一个以“人口问题”为幌子，企图在我国挑起“匈牙利事件”的右派分子、三级研究员陆钦范。从5日以来的三天中，农业科学院接连举行了三个下午的全院群众大会，对陆钦范的反共反社会主义言行进行了全面、系统的批判和揭发。
    正当右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，陆钦范花了三百数十元印了一万份他自己写的极端荒谬反动的小册子——“人口问题抛砖集”，送给全国人民代表大会，企图通过人民代表大会散发到全国各地去煽火。陆钦范在这本小册子中，把新社会描写成一团糟。他诬蔑新社会说：“解放以前是三个人的饭，五个人吃，现在生活改善了，四个人的饭，八个人吃”；又说什么“人代牲口拉犁，可悲地压低劳动生产率”；妄称中国资源贫乏，人口问题是目前社会主义建设的根本矛盾。他在歪曲地描述了我国人口“过剩”的严重性以后说：“假如我是蒋介石或杜勒斯，我就希望大陆上每一个十五岁到五十岁的妇女以每年生一个孩子的速度进行生育。这样在不到一年的时间里，比匈牙利事件规模更大的骚乱，就会在我国发生了。虽然这种假设的极端情况，仅是寓言性质的，我希望文艺工作者，在此百花齐放之春，可以取材于此，写一些产妇群众们如何不满，砸医院，砸牛奶场，砸工会要求福利等，这是第一阶段，接着是父母们为了要求送孩子入学，砸学校，城市青年们要求就业，砸工厂，农村青年们为了扩大不了耕地面积，纷纷离开合作社，以至牲口们为了养犊育驹，要求饲料地等等。”会上群众驳斥了陆钦范的马尔萨斯人口论以后，揭穿了陆钦范是假装为了所谓“人口过剩”而担忧，实质上是企图在我国挑起“匈牙利事件”。
    会上，群众一一批驳了陆钦范利用帮助党整风的机会，发表的其他许多破坏性、煽惑性的反动言论。陆钦范公然要求该院党员副院长陈凤桐下台。他恶毒地说“不找老和尚”是不行的。他和储安平一样，诬蔑国务院总理都是党员是宗派主义；污蔑共产党“已成为一个权利集团”，恶毒地说共产党是“世袭”，“比起土地私有制来更是真正的封建”；诅咒党“终究会被时代的车轮所抛弃”。骂党员是“坐轿”叫别人抬，是“慈禧太后”，污蔑“党员极大部分是坏的”，大呼“党员们赶快下轿”。
    批评者在会上揭穿了陆钦范反共反社会主义、图谋资本主义复辟的五个步骤：第一步，以造谣手法，挑拨党群关系；第二步，伪造“人口问题紧张”的空气，并且号召群众去找党的领导人争吵，企图掀起“匈牙利事件”；第三步，要求让地主资本家篡夺政权，达到资本主义复辟的罪恶目的。
    出身资本家家庭的陆钦范是一贯反共反社会主义、十分顽固、猖狂的右派分子。反右派斗争开始后，当群众驳斥他的反共反社会主义谬论时，他就出大字报，一一反抗、诡辩，谁批判他，他就找谁争吵，态度十分蛮横，妄想把批评者压下去。后来他看到形势不对，就大喊“要退出整风”，扬言今后不参加会议，不看大字报，不订人民日报，并且闭门不出，企图逃避斗争；同时，他向人宣布：“我准备流放，我不致于饿死……群众到他办公室去找他参加辩论会，他竟敢叫群众“滚出去！”并想把群众推出门去，还用棉花塞住两耳不听别人劝告，耍无赖态度。受到群众严厉驳斥后，他不得不参加了辩论会。经过多次的说理斗争和大量材料的被揭发，陆钦范的罪恶面貌越来越明显地暴露在群众面前。在斗争开始，还有些群众认为他是思想问题。而这时，大多数群众擦亮了眼睛，提高了觉悟，积极参加斗争。和陆钦范接近的人以及陆钦范的老同学，也起来参加战斗了。在群众集中力量揭发和批驳以后，向来不肯、也从未承认过错误的陆钦范，终于开始低头，嚣张的气焰已被打垮。群众斗争情绪越加高涨，许多人绘制了数十张标明新中国各种生产建设成就的图表，贴满在会场的墙壁上，集中地攻破了陆钦范的王牌——“人口问题抛砖集”。于是，陆钦范不得不承认了一部分反动言行，但还坚持说他的动机是好的。右派分子的顽抗，激起了群众愤怒的火焰，大家感觉到开大会发言的机会太少，纷纷要求与陆钦范开小会，短兵相接，一问一答，面对面地激辩。群众把“人口问题抛砖集”的几个基本论点排了队，分工准备意见，同陆钦范论战。这样，经过长期的、深入的、群众性的论战，陆钦范才不得不在最近初步承认自己主观上有反共情绪，因而产生了反共反社会主义言论。但是群众认为他的交代还是很不老实、不彻底。
    在这次全院大会上，发言批评陆钦范的有三十多人。还有六十多人已经写好了发言稿但是没有机会在会上发言。大批得不到发言机会的群众纷纷用大字报来表达他们的意见和愤怒。
    农业科学院对陆钦范的斗争将继续进行。
