Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 24th: Shanxi Province, with coal reserves accounting for two-thirds of the country's total, is China's largest base for prime coking coal.

According to preliminary surveys by the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, Xiangning, Gujiao, Fenxi, Wuxiang, and Hedong, all within Shanxi Province, have prime coking coalfields. The reserves of prime coking coal are estimated to be several billion tons, and the quality is excellent. The Gujiao coal region, located at the intersection of the Shi-Tai and North-South Tongpu railway lines, is rich in prime coking coal. In the Fenxi coalfield, a pair of modern mine shafts built for the development of prime coking coal have already commenced construction in 1956 and will be put into production next year. The Xiangning prime coking coalfield is connected underground to the Tongweibei coalfield in Shaanxi. Geologists are currently conducting large-scale drilling and surveying work here.

Shanxi is rich in coal resources, with a complete variety of coal types. In addition to prime coking coal, there are also coking-fat coal, lean coal, meager coal, and gas coal, among more than ten types needed by the metallurgical industry, chemical industry, and power industry, all of which are worth developing.

Underground in Shanxi, there are black coal seams everywhere. Preliminary surveys show that the coal reserves are approximately 400 billion tons. The reserves of the Qinshui coalfield in eastern Shanxi are three times larger than those of the famous Datong coalfield in Shanxi, making it a rarely seen large coalfield in the world. Shuoxian, in the southern part of the Datong coalfield, is a gas-fat coalfield with reserves of 9 billion tons. Here, the coal seams are thick and close to the surface, making it suitable for open-pit mining.

    山西——我国最大的主焦煤基地
    沁水煤田储量比大同煤田大三倍，是世界上罕见的大煤田
    新华社太原24日电　煤藏量占全国三分之二的山西省是我国最大的主焦煤基地。
    据华北煤田地质勘探局初步查明，山西境内的乡宁、古郊、汾西、武乡和河东等地都有主焦煤田，主焦煤的储量约有几十亿吨，而且品质优良。位于石太和南北同蒲铁路干线会交点的古郊煤区，蕴藏着大量的主焦煤。在汾西煤田上，为开发主焦煤而兴建的一对现代化的矿井已经在1956年动工兴建，将在明年投入生产。乡宁主焦煤田是从地下通往陕西同渭北煤田相连，目前地质人员正在这里进行大规模的钻探和测量工作。
    山西煤藏丰富，煤种齐全，除主焦煤以外，还有冶金工业、化学工业和动力工业需要的焦肥煤、贫煤、瘦煤和气煤等十多种，都有开发价值。
    山西境内地下到处是黑色煤层，初步查明煤的储量约为四千亿吨。山西东部沁水煤田煤的储量比山西著名的大同煤田还大三倍，是世界上罕见的大煤田。在大同煤田南部的朔县是蕴藏九十亿吨的气肥煤田。这里煤层厚、离地表近，适宜于露天开采。
