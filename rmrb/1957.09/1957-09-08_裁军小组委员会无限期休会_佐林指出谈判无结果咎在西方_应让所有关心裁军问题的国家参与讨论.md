    Disarmament Subcommittee Recesses Indefinitely
    Zorin Points Out the West is to Blame for the Failure of Negotiations
    All Countries Concerned About Disarmament Should Participate in Discussions
    London Dispatch from Our Newspaper, September 6th The Disarmament negotiations, which lasted for five and a half months, were adjourned today without reaching any agreement due to obstruction from Western countries. At today's subcommittee meeting, no decision was made on the date and location of the next meeting.
    Zorin made a statement at a press conference held this afternoon. He pointed out that the fundamental reason for the unsatisfactory work of the subcommittee and the failure to reach any agreement was the lack of sincere desire on the part of Western countries in the disarmament negotiations. Western countries are unwilling to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons and openly oppose condemning the use of these weapons, despite the fact that many facts show that it is possible to reach an agreement on this issue. They still consider these weapons to be the basis of their policies and military strategy.
    Zorin rebuked the so-called "new" proposal put forward by Western countries on August 29, which only proved that Western countries did not want to reach any agreement on the basic issues of disarmament. The negotiations of the Western countries in the subcommittee were merely an attempt to create the impression that they had made great efforts in the disarmament negotiations in order to deceive world opinion.
    He emphasized that the composition of the subcommittee was not conducive to the effective work of the subcommittee. He said: Among the five members of the subcommittee, the United States, Britain, France and Canada are all in leading positions in the North Atlantic Alliance; everyone knows that the policy basis of this alliance is to continue the arms race and prepare for a new war using atomic and hydrogen weapons.
    Zorin emphasized that the issue of disarmament should not be discussed secretly within the current narrow scope—the subcommittee—but that all countries concerned about resolving the issue of disarmament should participate in the discussion of disarmament issues.
    The subcommittee's report to the United Nations Disarmament Commission will be published next Wednesday in New York.

    裁军小组委员会无限期休会
    佐林指出谈判无结果咎在西方
    应让所有关心裁军问题的国家参与讨论
    本报6日伦敦专电　举行了五个半月的裁军谈判，由于西方国家的阻挠，在没有达成任何协议的情况下，于今日宣布休会。在今天的小组会上，没有对下次会议的日期和地点作出决定。
    佐林在今天下午举行的记者招待会上发表了谈话。他指出：小组委员会的工作不能令人满意以及未能取得任何协议的根本原因，是由于西方国家在裁军谈判中缺乏真诚的愿望。西方国家不愿停止试验原子武器和氢武器，并公开反对谴责使用这些武器，尽管许多事实表明了在这个问题上达成协议是可能的。他们仍认为这些武器是他们的政策和军事战略的基础。
    佐林斥责西方国家8月29日提出的所谓“新”建议，它只是证明了西方国家在裁军基本问题上是不想达成任何协议的。西方国家在小组会中的谈判，只不过企图造成这样一种印象：他们在裁军谈判中已经作了巨大的努力，以便蒙蔽世界舆论。
    他着重指出，小组委员会的成份不利于小组委员会有成效地工作。他说：在小组委员会的五个委员当中，美国、英国、法国和加拿大都在北大西洋联盟中居领导地位；大家都知道，这个联盟的政策基础是继续军备竞赛、准备进行使用原子武器和氢武器的新战争。
    佐林强调指出：裁军问题不应该在目前狭窄的范围——小组委员会里秘密讨论，应该让所有关心解决裁军问题的国家参与裁军问题的讨论。
    小组会对联合国裁军委员会的报告，将于下星期三在纽约发表。
