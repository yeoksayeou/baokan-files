Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: According to today's "Red Flag" newspaper report, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 17th opposing the United States' plan to conduct nuclear explosion tests in the Pacific next April, and at the same time, it accused the Japanese government of taking deceptive actions on the issue of banning nuclear weapons.

The statement pointed out that the United States chose to announce its plan to continue nuclear explosion tests at a time when the United Nations General Assembly was about to open. This was to show the United Nations General Assembly in advance its negative attitude towards the ban on nuclear weapons and disarmament. This action taken by the United States is a provocation to the world's peace forces demanding an unconditional and immediate ban on nuclear weapons.

The statement accused the Nobusuke Kishi government of only making a "formal protest" gesture against the United States' nuclear explosion tests, without truly demanding an immediate and unconditional ban on nuclear weapons from the standpoint of the Japanese people, and always taking a "vague" attitude on this issue.

　　日共中央发表声明
　　反对美国试验核武器
    新华社18日讯　据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会17日发表声明，反对美国预定明年4月在太平洋进行核爆炸试验，同时指责日本政府在禁止核武器问题上所采取的欺骗性行动。
    声明指出，美国选择在联合国大会正要开幕的时候发表它要继续进行核爆炸试验的计划，这是为了在事先向联合国大会表明它对禁止核武器和裁军的否定态度。美国采取的这一行动，是向全世界和平力量要求无条件立即禁止核武器运动的挑衅。
    声明指责岸信介政府对美国进行核爆炸试验只作出“形式上抗议”的姿态，而没有站在日本人民的立场上真正要求立即无条件地禁止核武器，并且始终在这个问题上采取“含糊”的态度。
