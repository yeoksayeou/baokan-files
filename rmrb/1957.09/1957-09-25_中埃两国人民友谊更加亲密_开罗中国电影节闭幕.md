Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 24th September: The Chinese Film Festival in Cairo closed on the evening of September 22nd after a week. Egyptian newspapers believe that this Chinese Film Festival is a gratifying event demonstrating the increasingly close friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian peoples.

    "The Republic" newspaper particularly pointed out that President Nasser's participation in the opening ceremony of the Chinese Film Festival "further consolidated the friendship between the peoples of these two countries."

    Cairo newspapers all published news of President Nasser's participation in the opening ceremony on the front page.

    "The Republic" also said: "This is the President's cordial tribute to the art of a friendly nation." The newspaper said that this is also "a vivid expression of the pure affection and respect that Egyptians have for the Chinese people."

    In the past week, many newspapers and magazines here have published articles introducing Chinese film art and the progress made in the Chinese film industry, and have also published interviews with Chinese film actresses Bai Yang and Qin Yi.

    "Al Massa" wrote that "the tendency towards realism expressed" in the themes of Chinese films "attracts our attention." Chinese films truthfully depict the heroism and love of freedom and independence shown by the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army when they were throwing off the shackles of imperialism and liberating themselves.

    "Rose El Youssef" weekly wrote that Chinese films "are realistic films that explore everything upright and noble in the lives of the people." The weekly also said that it portrays "the actual life of the people seeking love, food and great spirit in their daily lives."

    The Chinese film delegation will continue to tour scenic spots in Egypt and meet with Egyptian artists and other prominent figures.

    中埃两国人民友谊更加亲密
    开罗中国电影节闭幕
    新华社开罗24日电　中国电影节在开罗举行了一星期之后，在9月22日晚间闭幕。埃及报纸认为，这次中国电影节是表明中埃两国人民间日益亲密的友谊的可喜事件。
    “共和国报”特别指出，纳赛尔总统参加中国电影节的开幕典礼“进一步巩固了这两国人民之间的友谊”。
    开罗各报都曾在第一版刊载了纳赛尔总统参加开幕典礼的消息。
    “共和国报”还说：“这是总统对一个友好国家人民的艺术的亲切致敬。”这家报纸说，这也是“埃及人对中国人怀有的一种纯洁的喜爱和尊敬的生动表现”。
    在过去一星期中，这里许多报纸和杂志都曾经刊载专文，介绍中国的电影艺术以及中国电影事业取得的进步，并且还刊载了中国电影女演员白杨和秦怡的访问记。
    “晚报”写道，中国电影的主题中“表现出来的现实主义倾向吸引了我们的注意”。中国电影真实地刻划了中国人民和解放军在挣脱帝国主义的枷锁、解放自己的时候所表现的英勇和热爱自由独立的精神。
    “鲁兹·优素福”周刊写道，中国电影“是写实的电影，它探求人民生活中的一切正直和高尚的东西”。这家周刊又说，它刻划了“人民在日常生活中寻求爱情、粮食和伟大精神的实际生活”。
    中国电影代表团将在埃及继续游览名胜和会见埃及艺术家和其他著名人士。
