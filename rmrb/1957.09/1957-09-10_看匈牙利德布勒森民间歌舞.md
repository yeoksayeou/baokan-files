    Watching Hungarian Folk Song and Dance from Debrecen
    You Huihai

    In the spring of 1953, I was a guest in Budapest to participate in the second Hungarian folk art festival. This time, after watching the performance of the Debrecen Folk Song and Dance Troupe, it was like revisiting many unforgettable impressions in that beautiful country, making me love Hungary even more and miss Budapest even more.

    The folk song and dance troupe from Debrecen, the prosperous eastern economic, cultural, and railway center of Hungary, brings us purely preserved folk song and dance art.

    In the Czardas dance, which is the main basis of various forms of Hungarian folk dance, the folk dance of Debrecen, in addition to having the general characteristics of the Czardas dance, also has its own local color. The "Migeberci Czardas" and "Folk Dance from the Bihari Region" performed by the song and dance troupe have a passionate and heroic character. The dance sometimes uses performances with folk songs or rhythmic commands full of sincere folk life, showing the people's simplicity, purity, and liveliness. In the "Oyoek Girls' Dance," nine girls dance the typical slow Czardas in Hungarian girls' dances after a fast rhythm, moving slowly in parallel steps, showing the girls' leisure and poetic feminine mood. These extremely pure folk dances all have an enthusiastic and cheerful ending. Because the Czardas itself has the color of self-entertainment by performers, its cheerful atmosphere, expressed through music and stage image, makes the audience want to stand up and dance along.

    The unique style and skills of the Debrecen Folk Song and Dance Troupe's program also come directly from life. The herdsmen in the "Hortobágy Shepherd's Dance" have developed complex and rich skills on their herding sticks, making quick jumps on the ?heads, wrapping their feet around the sticks, throwing them back and forth, arranging the sticks on the ground to jump squares, snatching hats, etc. These all originated directly from the games and competitions of the herdsmen during rest while grazing on the grasslands. The entire dance is related to the life of the pastoral people, allowing people to see the herdsmen's robust and active character.

    The dances of Hungarian dancers always have a very pleasant tone because they are good at interweaving interesting details from life and character into the dance. These interweavings are often very vivid and attractive, humorous and bizarre; they constitute the optimistic character of the Hungarian people in the dance image. This kind of humorous interweaving makes the dance more distinctly Hungarian in customs and more national in color. This is the case in the "Female Cook Dance," where the female cooks wearing aprons and holding spoons humorously take the lead in dancing after the wedding, causing a joyful climax at the wedding.

    From describing certain fragment events and highlighting individual characters in folk dances, Hungarian dancers have further expressed folk dance dramas with complete plots and characters. From the dance drama "The Outlaw," we see the folk hero who robs the rich and helps the poor, resisting the persecution of aristocratic landlords. The simple and decisive dance form expresses the relationship between the hero and the people. The plot of this dance drama is clear, the characters have personalities, and the vocabulary of folk dance has been developed. For example, a dance performed by the outlaw's lover when she is persecuted by bad guys expresses her emotion of resistance in her movements and is combined with the task of the drama. In addition, the folk dance scenes interspersed in the dance drama, such as the outlaw meeting with the peasants and fighting with the bad guys, also achieve the consistency of the expressive form and the content of the plot. This practice of Hungarian dancers creating dance dramas based on folk dances will be a good inspiration for the creations of our country's dance artists.

    The folk band composed of seven musicians played folk music with a rich style; and enriched the performance that was seamlessly integrated with the dance with the characteristics of its folk dance music. Hearing the source of these folk music, one is reminded of the great folk source of Liszt and Brahms' outstanding Hungarian dances. The three violin leaders have skilled techniques and bold emotions. Sometimes the music suddenly changes from a slow Czardas to a fast Czardas, giving people a sense of sudden enlightenment. Sometimes the music changes from the gentle whispers of a pair of newlyweds to an enthusiastic and unrestrained wedding dance party. Sometimes it is like a secluded mountain forest, with the violin playing the duet of tits and nightingales in harmonics and pizzicato, occasionally interspersed with the sound of woodpeckers, and then the folk instrument, the cimbalom, is like the forest waking up from sleep, starting a lively burst... The band takes people into the poetic and picturesque scenery of Hungary's nature and people's lives.

    The folk song singing of the soloists showed the rich emotions and performing skills of the folk song singers. Androti Mimi has a lyrical voice and delicate expressions, while Saloy Laszlo has a rich tone and bold emotions. When several folk songs of different moods are sung in succession, turning from lyricism to cheerful Czardas dance music, followed by commands in allegro and humorous performances, the transitions are so natural and vivid, also showing the talents of the singers.

    The overall impression given by the Debrecen Folk Song and Dance Troupe's program is a strong and pure national color, the completeness of artistic style and form, and it is full of the Hungarian people's bold enthusiasm. They reflect the life and courageous and noble spirit of the Hungarian people, and through the performance, we see their spirit of fighting to defend the great achievements of socialist construction in the past twelve years and to strive for a better socialist construction!

    看匈牙利德布勒森民间歌舞
    游惠海
    1953年春天，我曾为参加匈牙利第二次民间艺术汇演，在布达佩斯作过客。这一次，看了德布勒森民间歌舞团的演出，像重温了在那个美丽的国家的许多难以磨灭的印象，使我更爱匈牙利，更怀念布达佩斯了。
    来自匈牙利富饶的东部经济、文化、铁路中心德布勒森城的民间歌舞团给我们带来的是保持得十分纯粹的民间歌舞艺术。
    在作为匈牙利民间舞多种形式的主要基础的恰尔达斯舞中，德布勒森的民间舞除了具有一般的恰尔达斯舞的特点外，还具有自己的地方色彩。歌舞团演出的“密盖贝尔契　恰尔达斯”和“比哈里地方的民间舞”就是具有一种热情、豪迈的特点的，舞蹈中有时以充满了民间真挚的生活情调的带唱或带节奏口令的表演，表现出人民的质朴、纯真、活泼。在“奥约克女郎舞”中，九个姑娘在快节奏之后跳着匈牙利姑娘舞中的典型的慢恰尔达斯，以缓慢的并步移动，显出姑娘们的悠闲和诗意的女性的心情。这几个极为纯粹的民间舞蹈都有一个热情欢快的结尾，由于恰尔达斯本身就是具有极为自然的表演者的自娱的色彩，因此它的那种通过音乐和舞台形象表达出来的欢快气氛，简直激动得观众想要起座随着同舞了。
    德布勒森民间歌舞团节目的特有风格和技巧，还直接来自生活。“霍尔多巴基牧人舞”的牧人们，在放牧用的木棍上发展出复杂丰富的技巧，在?头上作快速的跳越、以棍绕脚、来回变化的掷扔、把棍排在地上跳方格、抢帽子等等，这些都直接起源于牧人们在草原放牧休息时的游戏竞演，整个舞蹈和牧区人民的生活联系着，使人看到牧民们的刚健和活跃的性格。
    匈牙利舞蹈家们的舞蹈，总有一种非常愉快的调子，这是由于他们善于把生活中的和人物性格中的趣味细节穿插在舞蹈里。这些穿插往往是很生动吸引人的，幽默而离奇；构成了舞蹈形象中匈牙利人民的乐观的性格。这种风趣的穿插，就使舞蹈更鲜明的有匈牙利的风土人情味，更有民族色彩。在“女厨师舞”中就是如此，婚礼后穿围裙拿勺的女厨师们幽默地带头出来跳舞，引起了婚礼上欢乐的高潮。
    从民间舞蹈中描述某些片断事件情节和凸出个别人物，匈牙利舞蹈家们进而表现了有完整的情节和人物的民间舞剧。从舞剧“侠盗”中，我们看到那种劫富济贫，反抗贵族地主迫害的民间英雄，质朴而果敢的舞蹈形式，表现了英雄与人民的关系。这个舞剧情节清晰，人物具有性格，而且发展了民间舞蹈的语汇。例如侠盗的爱人被坏人迫害时所跳的一段舞，在动作中表现了她的反抗的感情，和戏剧的任务结合起来了。另外穿插在舞剧中的侠盗与农民的会见，与坏人的格斗等民间舞场面，也都达到表现形式与情节内容所要求的效果的一致。匈牙利舞蹈家这种在民间舞蹈基础上创作舞剧的实践，对于我国的舞蹈艺术家们的创作将有很好的启发。
    七位音乐家组成的民间乐队演奏了浓郁的风格的民间音乐；并以其民间舞曲的特色丰富了和舞蹈溶洽无间的表演，听到这些民间音乐的源泉，使人想起这是李斯特和勃朗斯杰出的匈牙利舞曲的伟大的民间源泉。三位提琴领奏者有着熟练的技巧和豪放的感情。有时乐曲从慢的恰尔达斯突而转入快的恰尔达斯，给人一种豁然开朗的情绪，有时乐曲从一对新婚的情侣温柔的细语转到热情奔放的婚礼舞会，有时又如僻静的山林，提琴在泛音和弹拨上奏出山雀和夜莺的对吟，偶尔夹以啄木的声音，然后民间乐器圣巴罗又像树林在沉睡中苏醒，开始一阵热闹……。乐队把人带到了匈牙利的大自然和人民生活的诗情画意中去了。
    独唱家的民歌演唱表现了民歌演唱者的丰富的感情和表演技巧。安德洛蒂·密密有着抒情的歌喉和细致的表情，而萨洛伊·拉斯洛有浑厚的音色和豪放的感情。当几首不同情调的民歌连贯接唱，由抒情转入愉快的恰尔达斯舞曲，接以口令快板和幽默风趣的表演，都是衔接转得那么自然、生动，也表现了歌唱家的才能。
    德布勒森民间歌舞团的节目给人总的印象是浓郁纯粹的民族色彩，艺术风格和形式的完整，充满了匈牙利人民豪放的热情，它们反映了匈牙利人民的生活和果敢崇高的精神，通过演出使我们看到他们为保卫十二年来的伟大的社会主义建设成就，为争取更美好的社会主义建设的斗争精神！
