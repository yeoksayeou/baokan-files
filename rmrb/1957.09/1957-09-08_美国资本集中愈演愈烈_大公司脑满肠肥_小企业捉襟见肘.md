Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from New York: The American "Fortune" magazine recently published its annual directory of the 500 largest industrial corporations in the United States (1956). The directory includes an article entitled "The Fat 500: An Unprecedentedly Profitable Year." The article states that these 500 corporations account for about half of the United States' manufacturing and mining output, and a quarter of the total industrial output of the capitalist world. They also account for two-thirds (65%) of all after-tax profits of American manufacturing and mining companies.

Some details from the "Fortune" magazine survey are as follows: In 1956, 32 of the 500 largest companies had sales of ten billion or more US dollars, and 347 companies had sales of one hundred million or more US dollars; 22 companies had assets of ten billion or more US dollars; and 16 companies had after-tax profits of one hundred million or more US dollars.

"Fortune" magazine also published an article in the same issue by Thomas Murphy entitled "The Great Anxiety of Small Business: Money." He said that since World War II, small manufacturing companies (his definition of "small" includes those with assets of less than five million dollars) as a whole have not increased their sales or profits.

In fact, since 1951, the sales of small manufacturing companies have declined. In that year, small manufacturing companies' sales were $76 billion, accounting for about 35% of total manufacturing sales. But by 1956, their share had fallen to $73 billion, or 25% of total sales last year.

Meanwhile, from 1947 to 1956, small manufacturers with assets of $250,000 to $5 million earned an average net profit of 10.5% of net output value. But large companies with assets of over $100 million "earned" a net profit of 13.7% of net output value.

    美国资本集中愈演愈烈
    大公司脑满肠肥　小企业捉襟见肘
    新华社7日讯　纽约消息：美国“幸福”杂志最近发行了关于美国五百家最大企业公司情况（1956年）的年鉴，年鉴中附有一篇文章，题目是“脑满肠肥的五百家：空前未有的最赚钱的一年”。文章说，五百家企业公司占有美国的制造品产量和采矿产量的一半左右，并且占资本主义世界总工业产量的四分之一，它们还占有所有美国制造和采矿公司纳税后利润的三分之二（65％）。
    “幸福”杂志调查的一些详情如下：在1956年，五百家大公司中有三十二家的销售额达到十亿或十亿美元以上，有三百四十七家公司的销售额达到一亿美元或更多一些；资产达到十亿美元或更多一些的公司有二十二家；在纳税后获利一亿美元或更多一些的有十六家。
    “幸福”杂志在同期还发表了托马斯·墨菲写的一篇题为“小企业的巨大忧虑：钱”的文章。他说，自从第二次世界大战以来，小规模的制造公司（他的“小规模”的意义包括那些资产在五百万美元以下的公司）整个来说，并没有增加它们的销售或利润额。
    而实际上，自从1951年以来，小规模制造公司的销售额已经缩减。在那一年，小制造公司销售额为七百六十亿美元，占制造品的总销售额的35％左右。但是到了1956年，它们所占的数目就降到七百三十亿美元，或占去年总销售额的25％。
    同时，从1947年到1956年，拥有二十五万美元到五百万美元资产的小制造商平均赚得的纯利润占纯产值的10.5％。但是拥有一亿美元以上资产的大公司“赚得”的纯利润占纯产值的13.7％。
