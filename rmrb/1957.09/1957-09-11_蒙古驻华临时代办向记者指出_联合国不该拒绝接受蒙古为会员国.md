Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Mongolian People's Republic in China, Tsedendambaev, held a press conference in Beijing today, pointing out that it is unjust for the United Nations not to accept the Mongolian People's Republic as a member state, and once again expressed the urgent desire to join the United Nations.

More than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists attended the press conference.

Tsedendambaev said that since 1948, the Mongolian People's Republic has submitted applications to join the United Nations four times. Although the majority of United Nations member states support the Mongolian People's Republic, it has not yet been accepted into the United Nations.

He then listed the achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic in economic and cultural construction, and said that more than half of the countries in the world have now established diplomatic relations with it. He finally believed that the United Nations must accept it into the United Nations.

　　蒙古驻华临时代办向记者指出
　　联合国不该拒绝接受蒙古为会员国
    新华社10日讯　蒙古人民共和国驻华使馆临时代办策登依什今日在北京举行记者招待会，指出联合国不接受蒙古人民共和国为会员国是不公正的，并再一次提出申请加入联合国的迫切愿望。
    参加记者招待会的有中外记者三十多人。
    策登依什说，从1948年起，蒙古人民共和国已经四次提出申请要求加入联合国，虽然大多数的联合国会员国支持蒙古人民共和国，但是，到目前为止，它还没有被接受加入联合国。
    他接着列举了蒙古人民共和国在经济、文化建设方面的成就，并说，现在已经有占人类半数以上的国家同它建立了外交关系。他最后认为，联合国必须接受它加入联合国。
