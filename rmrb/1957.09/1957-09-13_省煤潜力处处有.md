Coal-Saving Potential Exists Everywhere

(Our Dispatch) The China Coal Construction Company of the Ministry of Commerce, in accordance with the State Council's directive on saving coal, recently held a national coal-saving exhibition at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing. This exhibition, through numerous physical objects, pictures, and explanations, introduces the experiences of various regions in saving coal.

In recent years, China's coal production has been continuously increasing, but due to rapid industrial development and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the supply of coal is still not very abundant. If we take the total national coal production and demand in 1949 as 100, then the production in 1956 was 357, and the demand was 378. Coal supplied to the market through commercial departments accounted for 37% of the total production in 1952, and 45% in 1956. After agricultural cooperation, the rural economy has undergone fundamental changes. In the past, firewood and grass used as fuel are now mostly used as feed and fertilizer, so the proportion of farmers burning coal will gradually increase. Although China's coal reserves are very rich, the construction of coal mines requires technology, investment, and a relatively long time. It is very difficult to fully meet the coal needs of production and life in a short period of time. In addition to actively building modern coal mines and small and medium-sized coal kilns, the Party and the government require every organization, school, group, enterprise, and family to do everything possible to save coal.

　　Lao Zhengxing's "Nine-Eye Stove"

The total fuel cost of the catering industry in Shanghai accounts for 3%-5% of its turnover, but the fuel cost of the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Fuyou Road in the city averaged only 1.3% in the second quarter of this year. The reason is that this restaurant improved its stove, saving 40% of coal consumption compared to the past.

Most of the restaurants in Shanghai use "three-eye stoves," with one fire eye for stir-frying and the other two auxiliary eyes for stewing or braising. During slow business hours, one stove fire is not enough, and two stove fires are too much. The Lao Zhengxing Restaurant combined the fire channels of two stoves into one, changing it into a "nine-eye stove" with one fire eye, two soup pots, and six auxiliary eyes. Three eyes can be used for stir-frying and four eyes for braising, which can be used freely. Even when the business is busiest, with 150 people dining at the same time, it can still meet the demand.

　　Using Flue Waste Heat to Heat Water

The heat in the flue gas escaping from the boiler flue generally accounts for about 20% of the heat inside the boiler. The staff of the Tieling County Pharmaceutical Company in Liaoning Province welded two 53-gallon large oil drums together, put them on the boiler flue, and installed faucets and water meters on them to make a tea stove that uses boiler flue waste heat without burning coal separately. The hot water boiled by this tea stove every day is enough for more than 70 people to drink, wash their faces, and wash their clothes.

The Harbin Normal School made an iron hot water tank with a concave bottom, placed it on the flue of the heating boiler, and installed drain pipes inside the flue to absorb the flue waste heat. This method turned the water transported to the boiler into hot water. As a result, it not only saved 9.3% of coal but also guaranteed the domestic water use of more than 1,000 people in winter.

　　Series-Connected Tea Stoves

Most of the tea stoves in many hotels in Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, used to be in the form of high stoves, with two fire eyes for boiling water. A metal bucket was placed between the two fire eyes, using the heat from the two cores to heat the water in the metal bucket for washing faces. However, the heat on the outer sides of the two stoves was not utilized. Another disadvantage was that when there were many guests, two fire eyes were not enough to boil water, and when there were few guests, the fire was redundant.

Recently, many hotels have changed the two fire eyes with one bucket in the middle to one fire eye with two buckets on either side, making full use of the firepower to boil water. In order to make the water in the buckets boil as well, they used an iron pipe to connect the water from the right bucket to the left bucket. The iron pipe runs diagonally through the furnace, with the right side higher than the left side. The furnace fire heats the iron pipe, and the water in the pipe rises to the right bucket. The water in the right bucket boils in more than 20 minutes. Due to the convection of water, the water in the left bucket also boils in another 15 minutes. In addition, adding a pot or bucket on the fire eye in the middle to boil water can fully guarantee the water use of passengers. According to the survey, the improved hotels can save an average of one-third of coal. For example, before the stove was modified, the No. 1 branch used 2,500 to 3,000 catties of coal per month for two fire eyes, with a dedicated person watching the fire, and still could not meet the water needs of 100 people every day. After the stove was modified, no dedicated person was needed to watch the fire, and only 1,500 catties of coal were used per month.

　　Using Tea Stove Steam to Cook Rice

Using tea stove steam to heat rice is very common. However, using steam to directly cook rice is not very common. The Dalian Tianjin Street Department Store is currently one of the units that uses tea stove steam to directly cook rice.

The tea stove in this store is very large and can hold 600 catties of water. Using its steam to cook rice can feed 1,000 people at a time. The method is to install an iron pipe on the top of the stove and make a wooden steam cabinet, put the pipe into the cabinet, put the rice and dishes to be steamed in the grids of the cabinet door, and close the cabinet door tightly, so that it is airtight on three sides, but leave a gap around the cabinet door to avoid accidents caused by excessive steam. They call this tea stove a "dual-purpose stove for boiling water and steaming rice." It can steam rice, steamed buns, corn bread, sorghum rice, and various dishes.

The dual-purpose stove has two major advantages. One is to save time and reduce the labor intensity of the cooks. In the past, this store steamed 300 catties of steamed buns, which required steaming three pots for 105 minutes. Now it only takes 30 minutes. The second is to save coal. In the past, three pots of steamed buns used 138 catties of coal. Now, only 18 catties of coal are needed in the tea stove to boil water, cook rice, and cook dishes.

　　Only Three Liang of Coal Used Per Person Per Day

Among the collective food units in Nanjing City, the most coal-saving one is the Affiliated Middle School of Nanjing Normal College. The comrades of the cooking team, led by Comrade Yang Xingyi, changed small pots to large pots, reduced the original four stoves to two, and at the same time used old materials to install four turns of tap water pipes in the stove, allowing cold water to slowly pass through the stove and heat up before being sent to the pot. When the water in the pot is full, it is also ready to boil. They also welded two large iron buckets together and put them on the chimney to use the waste heat of the chimney to heat water. They also developed a "horseshoe-shaped half-side coal burning method." In this way, the average coal consumption per person per day in this food unit with 1,600 people dropped from ten liang to three liang. According to the materials currently collected by the China Coal Construction Company, this coal consumption level is the most advanced in the country.

　　Helping Residents Modify Stoves

The stores of the Shenyang Municipal State-owned Coal Industry Building Materials Company send staff to residents to modify stoves free of charge, actively helping residents save coal.

As of September 6, more than 11,400 stoves have been modified in the city, and it is expected that more than 16,000 stoves can be modified before the ground freezes in mid-November. The modified stoves not only save coal but also have strong flames and cook food quickly. Liu Jiusheng's family on Shouquan Street in Huanggu District used to burn 12 catties of coal every day, but after the stove was modified, they only needed to burn 4 catties a day.

　　Honeycomb Coal Stove with Water Tank

Beijing recently trial-produced a honeycomb coal stove with a water tank, which is made of iron sheet and has a furnace installed at the end near the chimney. The other end of the stove is a water tank with an iron cover on the top and a faucet at the bottom to release hot water. A warm box is installed at the bottom of the water tank, which can be used to keep food warm.

Because this stove is equipped with a chimney and the outside of the furnace is shaped like a tile rack, the heat radiates, so it can be used for heating and cooking.

　　Popular Honeycomb Coal Stove in Beijing

According to preliminary estimates, about 40,000 households out of the 600,000 households in Beijing use honeycomb coal stoves.

The honeycomb coal stove is easy to seal and can stay lit for a long time. It is convenient to use when going to work during the day and returning at night, and it is very convenient for boiling water, cooking rice, and cooking dishes, so general cadres are happy to use it.

Honeycomb coal stoves have many advantages, the most important of which are saving coal, saving money, saving firewood, producing less ash, being clean and hygienic, and being easy to use. According to a typical survey in Beijing: a family of six or seven people burns about 105 pieces of honeycomb coal per month, and together with firewood bricks and charcoal bricks for ignition, it costs at most 4.4 yuan per month, which is about one yuan less than burning a coal briquette stove. In this way, 13 yuan can be saved in a year, which is enough for three months of coal fire expenses. In addition to saving household expenses, each household can save 900 catties of coal for the country every year, save 360 catties of firewood, and produce 330 catties less of garbage, which can greatly alleviate the city's transportation volume. If all 600,000 households in Beijing switch to honeycomb coal stoves, the country can save more than 300,000 tons of coal throughout the year. These coals can generate 480 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and can roll 3.6 million tons of steel, and can also save more than 200 million catties of firewood.

　　Labor-Saving and Coal-Saving Lime Kiln

At present, many places burn lime in semi-truncated can-shaped lime kilns. Each time the material is loaded, it must be surrounded and sealed with mud bricks. After burning, the mud bricks must be removed, which not only wastes manpower and prolongs the kiln burning time, but also has low output and high coal consumption. The best one cattie of coal can only burn about six catties of lime.

Xu Bingzhu, a worker in Guan County, Shandong Province who has been burning lime for many years, has developed a method of burning lime in a leaky kiln. It is a rectangular fixed kiln built with stone and adobe, which does not need to be dismantled every time it is burned. The biggest advantage is that after the kiln fire is lit, coal and materials can be added from the top of the kiln, and lime can be leaked from the furnace bars at the bottom of the kiln. It is loaded and discharged continuously, with cyclical operation, and the kiln fire does not stop. The production efficiency is increased by more than ten times, and each catty of coal burns an average of ten catties of lime. (Attached picture)

　　Loaded by train, the length of the carriages can be arranged from Beijing to Zhengzhou, Henan, about 1300 li, which is almost equal to half of the Beijing-Hankou Railway.

　　省煤潜力处处有
    本报讯　商业部中国煤建公司根据国务院关于节约用煤的指示精神，最近在北京苏联展览馆举办了一个全国性的节约用煤展览会。这个展览会通过许多实物、图片和说明，介绍各地节省用煤的经验。
    几年来，我国煤的生产是不断增长的，但因为工业发展快，以及人民生活水平逐渐提高，煤的供应还不很充裕。如果以1949年全国煤的总产量和需要量为100，那末1956年产量为357，需要量为378。通过商业部门供应市场的煤，1952年占总产量的37％，1956年就占45％。农业合作化以后，农村经济发生了根本变化，过去用作燃料的柴草，现在大部分拿来作饲料和肥田用，所以农民烧煤的比重，还要逐渐增加。我国煤的蕴藏量虽然很丰富，但是建设煤井需要技术、投资和比较长的时间，要在短时间内充分满足生产和生活的用煤需要，是有很大困难的。党和政府除了积极建设现代化煤井和中小型的煤窑以外，要求每一个机关、学校、团体、企业和家庭，都想尽一切办法来节省煤。
　　老正兴的“九眼灶”
    上海市饮食业的总燃料费，占营业额的3％—5％，可是该市福佑路东记老正兴饭馆，今年二季度所用的燃料费平均只占1.3％。原因是这个饭店改进了炉灶，使用煤量比过去节省40％。
    上海的饮食店用的大都是“三眼灶”，一个火眼炒菜，其余两个副眼炖菜或焖菜，在营业清淡时，用一灶火不够，用两灶火又有余。东记老正兴饭馆把两个灶的火道打通合并为一个，改成为一个火眼，两个汤灌和六个副眼的“九眼灶”。其中三个眼可以用来炒菜，四个眼焖菜，运用自如。在营业最忙的时候，上下满座一百五十人同时用餐，也能供应得上。
　　利用烟道余热烧水
    从锅炉烟道跑掉的烟气中的热量，一般占锅炉内热量的20％左右。辽宁省铁岭县医药公司的职工把两个五十三加仑的大油桶焊接起来，套在锅炉烟道上，上面安有水龙头和水表等，做成了一个利用锅炉烟道余热而不用另行烧煤的茶炉。每天用这个茶炉烧的开水可以够七十多人饮用和洗脸、洗衣服。
    哈尔滨市师范学校作了一个铁制的温水箱，水箱的底部成凹形，安放在暖汽锅炉的烟道上，并在烟道里面设置了排管，以吸取烟道余热。用这个办法使向锅炉里输运的水变成了热水。结果，不仅节省了9.3％的煤炭，并且还保证了一千多人在冬天的生活用水。
　　串水茶炉
    陕西省宝鸡市许多旅店的茶水炉，原来大部分都是高灶形式的，有两个火眼烧开水。两个火眼之间夹一个铁桶，利用两炉心的热力把铁桶里的水烤热供洗脸用。但两炉外侧的热力却没有利用。还有一个缺点是客人多时，两个火眼烧开水不够用，客人少时，炉火又有多余。
    最近，许多旅店把两个火眼夹一桶改为两桶夹一个火眼，充分利用火力烧水。为了使水桶的水也能烧开，他们又用一根铁管将右桶的水通到左桶。铁管斜穿过炉膛，右边比左边高。炉火烧铁管，管里的水受热就往右桶上升，右桶里的水有二十多分钟就开了。由于水的对流，再过十五分钟，左桶的水也开了。再加上中间火眼上的坐壶或坐桶也烧开水，就能充分保证旅客用水。据调查，改进的各户旅店平均可以节约三分之一的煤。如一分社改灶前两个火眼每月烧煤二千五百斤到三千斤，一个专人看火，每天还不能满足一百人用水；改灶后，不用专人看火，每月只用一千五百斤煤。
　　用茶炉的蒸气做饭
    利用茶炉的蒸气热饭，是很普遍的。但用蒸气来直接做饭，还不多见。大连天津街百货商店是目前利用茶炉蒸气来直接做饭的一个单位。
    这个商店的茶炉很大，能盛六百市斤水，利用它的蒸气来做饭，一次可以够一千人食用。办法是在炉顶安一根铁管子，再做一个蒸饭木柜，把管子伸入柜里，把要蒸的饭菜放在柜门的格子里，把柜门关紧，使它三面不透气，但要在柜门周围留点缝，以免蒸气过多发生事故。他们把这种茶炉叫做“烧水蒸饭两用炉”。蒸米饭、馒头、窝头、高粱米和蒸各种菜都行。
    两用炉有两大好处。一是节省时间，减轻炊事员同志的劳动强度。过去这个商店蒸三百斤面的馒头，要蒸三锅，用一百零五分钟，现只用三十分钟就行了。二是省煤。过去三锅馒头用一百三十八斤煤，现在只在茶炉里多用十八斤煤就可以烧开水、做饭和做菜了。
　　每人每天只用三两煤
    在南京市的集体伙食单位中，最省煤的要算南京师范学院附属中学了。以杨兴义同志为首的炊事班的同志们，把小锅改为大锅，把原用四个灶减去两个，同时利用旧料在灶膛里盘四圈自来水管，让冷水慢慢地在灶膛里经过，烧热了才送到锅里去，等锅里的水放满的时候，也正好“开锅”了。他们还用两只大铁桶焊接在一起，套在烟囱上，利用烟囱的余热烧热水。他们还摸索出一种“马蹄式半边烧煤法”。这样，这个一千六百人的伙食单位，每人每天的平均耗煤量就从十两降为三两。这个耗煤水平，从中国煤建公司目前所搜集的材料来看，是全国最先进的了。
    帮居民修改炉灶
    沈阳市国营煤业建筑器材公司各商店派工作人员给居民义务修改炉灶，积极帮助居民节约用煤。
    到9月6日止，全市已修改炉灶一万一千四百多个，预计到11月中旬上冻以前还可以修改一万六千多个。修改后的炉灶，不但省煤，而且火苗旺，做饭快。皇姑区寿泉街刘九生家，过去每天要烧十二斤煤，改灶以后每天只烧四斤就够。
    带水箱的蜂窝煤炉
    北京市最近试制了一种带水箱蜂窝煤炉，是铁皮制成的，在靠近烟囱的一端装设炉膛。炉的另一端是水箱，上端有铁盖，下端有龙头，可以放出热水。水箱下部装置暖箱一个，可作食物保温之用。
    这种炉子因为装有烟囱，炉膛外部又呈瓦栊状，热力起辐射作用，可用它取暖兼作饭。
　　北京时兴的蜂窝煤炉
    据目前初步估算，在北京市的六十万户居民中，约有四万多户使用蜂窝煤炉子。
    蜂窝煤炉封火简单，可以长时间不熄，白天上班，晚间回来仍有火用，烧水、煮饭和煮菜都很方便，所以一般机关干部都乐于使用。
    蜂窝煤炉的优点很多，最主要的是省煤、省钱、省劈柴、出灰少、清洁卫生、使用方便。据北京市典型调查：六、七口人之家每月烧蜂窝煤约一百零五块，连同引火用的柴砖和炭砖，每月最多需要四点四元，比烧煤球炉少一元左右。这样，一年就可以节省十三元，够三个月煤火费。烧蜂窝煤除节省家庭开支外，每户一年还可为国家节约煤炭九百斤，节约劈柴三百六十斤，少出垃圾三百三十斤，可以大大缓和市内的运输量。如果全北京市六十万户居民全部改用蜂窝煤炉，全年就能为国家节约煤炭三十余万吨，用这些煤可以发电四亿八千万度，可以轧钢三百六十万吨，还能节约劈柴二亿多斤。
　　省工又省煤的石灰窑
    目前很多地方烧石灰都是用半截罐子形的石灰窑，每次装料都要用泥坯围好、封严，烧好后又要把泥坯拆掉，不但浪费人力，延长烧窑时间，并且产量低、用煤多，最好的一斤煤只能烧六斤左右石灰。
    山东冠县一个多年烧石灰的工人叫许炳柱，研究出一种漏窑烧石灰的方法。它是一种用石料、土坯垒好的长方形的固定窑，不用烧一次拆一次。最大的好处是窑火点着后，可以从窑顶上添煤添料，从窑底炉条下漏泄石灰，随装随出，循环作业，窑火不停，生产效率提高了十倍多，每斤煤平均烧十斤石灰。（附图片）
　　用火车装载，车厢的长度可从北京摆到河南的郑州，约1300里，几乎等于京汉铁路的一半。
