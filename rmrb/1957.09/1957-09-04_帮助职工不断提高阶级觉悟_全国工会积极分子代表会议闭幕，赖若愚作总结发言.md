Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd - The National Conference of Active Trade Union Members closed today.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a concluding speech at today's meeting.

He said that this meeting fully reflected the role of active trade union members and also reflected the organizational role of the trade unions. Many experiences of grassroots trade union work and active members were exchanged at the meeting, and these experiences are very important. He said that at present, China has 3.48 million active trade union members. Through them, the trade unions are connected with the masses of workers like flesh and blood, and can understand the emotions and requirements of the masses at any time. Therefore, in the future, we should continue to give full play to the role of active members, reduce the fluidity of their work, help them overcome shortcomings, and improve their level.

Lai Ruoyu said that from the many experiences exchanged at this meeting, the quality of trade union work mainly depends on the relationship between the trade union and the masses, and its effect is concentrated in production. Although the work of the trade union is multifaceted, all these works are to strengthen the connection with the workers, so that they can play a greater role in production. Therefore, all the work of the trade union should revolve around production. At the same time, the trade union must always care about the lives of the workers and protect their interests. There can be two different approaches in this regard: one is to only take care of the temporary and partial interests of the masses, ignoring long-term and overall interests; the other is to care about the vital interests of the workers from the perspective of the overall interests of the working class. The trade union should first pay attention to the overall interests of the workers, and at the same time, try to solve the workers' living problems without hindering the overall interests. The trade union should strengthen its ties with the masses, not only to appropriately meet the reasonable demands of the workers, but also to improve the consciousness of the masses. The trade union should adhere to the policy of persuasion and education when dealing with the incorrect demands of the masses; when implementing the correct demands of the masses, it should also implement the policy of diligence and thrift, and try to mobilize the masses to rely on their own strength to solve their own problems. Therefore, properly handling the welfare issues of workers is also a process of raising the consciousness of the masses. Only in this way can the trade union better connect with the masses and enhance the internal unity of the enterprise.

Lai Ruoyu analyzed how the trade union should correctly treat the relationship with the enterprise administration. He emphasized that, first of all, it should be clear that in socialist enterprises, the consistency between the trade union and the enterprise administration is basic, and the difference is not basic. Because the trade union and the enterprise administration are working under the leadership of the Party committee, and the common goal of both parties is to improve production and better complete the national plan. The so-called difference, some belong to ideological understanding, and some belong to working methods. Inconsistencies in understanding can be achieved through discussion, criticism and self-criticism; inconsistencies in working methods, that is, the trade union and the administration complete common tasks from different aspects, are needed. Therefore, the difference and consistency between the enterprise administration and the trade union cannot be regarded as equal. And the responsibility for the quality of any relationship belongs to both parties. From the perspective of the trade union, it should strive to make the relationship more harmonious, proactively consider the opinions of the enterprise administration, distinguish right from wrong, and make the opinions of both parties consistent. The purpose of the mass supervision organized by the trade union is also to help and support the enterprise administration, so that the shortcomings and errors in the enterprise's work can be exposed and corrected in time. This kind of supervision is essentially different from the trade union supervision in capitalist enterprises in the past.

Lai Ruoyu also talked about the regulatory role of the trade union in resolving internal contradictions in the enterprise. He said that the trade union has its special role in this regard. The internal contradictions of the enterprise mainly come from two aspects: one is the bureaucracy of the enterprise leadership, and the other is the low consciousness of the masses. The trade union certainly cannot condone the bureaucracy of the enterprise leadership, and must also conduct persuasion and education on the unreasonable demands of the masses. The trade union should support and help the correct requirements and opinions of the enterprise administration or the workers. If there are inconsistencies in the ideological understanding between the two parties, the trade union should organize discussions well, distinguish right from wrong, and use the policy of unity-criticism-unity to reach consensus. Lai Ruoyu said that it should be believed that because the workers and the administration are fundamentally consistent in socialist enterprises, all inconsistencies in ideological understanding will eventually become consistent after repeated and serious discussions.

Lai Ruoyu also talked about the establishment of worker representative conferences, rectification in enterprises, and the development of advanced producer movements in the report.

This conference opened on August 21. During the meeting, in addition to introducing the work experience of the grassroots committees of the trade union at the conference, symposiums were held according to professional fields, and the work experience of active trade union members was widely exchanged. The representatives also listened to the report of Liu Shi, Minister of the Organization Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on the work of the trade union in the worker representative conference.

Li Xuefeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, also attended the meeting and made a report.

The award ceremony was also held at the conference today. More than a thousand representatives of active trade union members who attended the meeting received prizes and certificates respectively.

### 帮助职工不断提高阶级觉悟  全国工会积极分子代表会议闭幕，赖若愚作总结发言

    帮助职工不断提高阶级觉悟
    全国工会积极分子代表会议闭幕，赖若愚作总结发言
    新华社3日讯　全国工会积极分子代表会议今天闭幕。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在今天的会上作了总结性的发言。
    他说，这次会议充分反映了工会积极分子的作用，也反映了工会的组织作用。会上交流了许多工会基层工作和积极分子的经验，这些经验都是非常重要的。他说，目前我国已经有三百四十八万工会积极分子，通过他们，使工会与职工群众血肉般地联系在一起，随时能够了解到群众的情绪和要求。因此，今后应该很好地继续发挥积极分子的作用，减少他们工作的流动性，帮助他们克服缺点，提高水平。
    赖若愚说，从这次会上交流的许多经验来看，工会工作的好坏，主要决定于工会同群众的关系，而它的效果却是集中表现在生产上。工会的工作虽然是多方面的，但是所有这些工作都是为了密切与职工的联系，使他们在生产中发挥更大作用。所以，工会的一切工作都应该围绕着生产来进行。同时，工会也必须时刻关心职工的生活，保护职工的利益。这方面可以有两种不同的做法，一种是只照顾群众暂时的局部的利益，忽视长远利益和整体利益；另一种是从工人阶级整体利益出发来关心工人的切身利益。工会首先应该注意的是职工的整体利益，同时在不妨碍整体利益的前提下来努力解决职工的生活问题。工会要加强与群众的联系，不仅要适当满足职工的合理要求，同时也必须提高群众的觉悟。工会在对待群众的不正确的要求时，应该坚持说服教育的方针；在执行群众正确要求时，也应该贯彻勤俭的方针，并且尽可能发动群众依靠自己的力量来解决自己的问题。所以，正确地处理职工的生活福利问题，也是提高群众觉悟的过程。只有这样，工会才能更好地联系群众，并且增强企业内部的团结。
    赖若愚就工会如何正确地对待同企业行政的关系问题进行了分析。他强调指出，首先应该弄清楚，在社会主义企业内，工会同企业行政的一致是基本的，差别不是基本的。因为工会和企业行政都是在党委领导下进行工作，双方的奋斗目标也都是为了搞好生产，更好地完成国家计划。所谓差别，有些是属于思想认识上的，有些是属于工作方法上的。属于认识上的不一致，可以通过讨论、批评和自我批评达到一致；属于工作方法上的不一致，即工会和行政从不同的方面来完成共同的任务，这是需要的。所以不能把企业行政同工会之间的差别和一致放在同等的地位上来看待。而且任何关系的好坏，责任都是属于双方面的。就工会方面来说，应该努力使关系搞得更和谐，主动地多考虑企业行政的意见，分清是非，使双方的意见达到一致。工会组织的群众监督，目的也是为了帮助和支持企业行政，使企业工作中的缺点和错误能够揭发出来，及时加以纠正。这种监督和过去在资本主义企业中的工会监督是有本质区别的。
    赖若愚还谈到了工会在解决企业内部矛盾中的调节作用问题。他说，工会在这方面是有着它的特殊作用的。企业内部的矛盾主要是从两方面来的，一方面是企业领导上的官僚主义，另一方面是群众觉悟不高。工会对企业领导上的官僚主义固然不能迁就，对群众的不合理的要求也必须进行说服教育。工会不论对企业行政或职工群众的正确要求和意见，都应该予以支持和帮助。如果双方在思想认识上有不一致的地方，工会就应当很好地组织讨论，分清是非，用团结——批评——团结的方针，取得一致。赖若愚说，应该相信，由于社会主义企业内职工和行政是根本一致，凡是思想认识上的不一致，只要经过反复认真讨论，最后总会一致起来。
    赖若愚在报告中还谈到了建立职工代表大会、企业中整风和开展先进生产者运动等问题。
    这次会议是在8月21日开幕的。会议期间，除了在大会上介绍了工会基层委员会的工作经验以外，还按专业举行了座谈会，广泛交流了工会积极分子的工作经验。代表们并且听取了全国总工会组织部部长刘实关于职工代表大会中的工会工作的报告。
    中共中央书记处书记李雪峰也到会作了报告。
    大会今天还举行了发奖仪式。到会的一千多个工会积极分子代表分别得到了奖品和奖状。
