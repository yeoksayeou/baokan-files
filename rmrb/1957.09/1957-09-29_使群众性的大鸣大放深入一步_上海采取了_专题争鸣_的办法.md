To Deepen the Mass-Scale Blooming and Contending
Shanghai Adopted the Method of "Topical Contention"

(Our newspaper Shanghai, 28th dispatch) How to make the mass-scale blooming and contending even more in-depth? A form of "topical contention" recently adopted by the organs and schools in Shanghai that have launched the rectification movement has proven to be a feasible method.

"Topical contention" (some call it "topical debate") is proposed on the basis of a fairly sufficient "blooming and contending." The purpose is to make the contention more in-depth and focused on the main issues. Since the Shanghai First Normal School began its large-scale blooming and contending in early September, the masses have posted more than 3,000 big-character posters, held more than 900 meetings of various sizes, and more than 170 people have expressed their opinions on the "radio station." Many questions have been raised, but some questions need to be explored further. The school leaders decided to continue mobilizing the masses to raise opinions through big-character posters, seminars, and other forms; at the same time, they adopted the form of "topical contention" to conduct in-depth debates on several issues that teachers and students are most concerned about and have major differences of opinion, such as "the social status of teachers" and "rural issues."

After comprehensively studying the more than 5,200 opinions raised by the masses, the Shanghai Second Medical College Party Committee summarized eight topics such as "teaching reform and learning from the Soviet Union," "can the Party lead higher education," and "the labor perspective of college students" to further expand the contention.

The topics of "topical contention" must be well-chosen and accurately grasped. They must truly address the fundamental issues in the work and thinking of the unit; they must be issues that are genuinely of universal concern to the masses but have not been resolved. This will enable the contention to be launched enthusiastically and achieve the best results. A topic proposed by Shanghai Jiaotong University is "What is the tradition of Jiaotong University? How should the tradition of Jiaotong University be inherited?" This topic is very good because it raises the fundamental issue in the work of Jiaotong University, and the understanding of this issue by the teachers and students of Jiaotong University is very inconsistent. After studying the large number of opinions from the masses, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and some industrial trade unions have also put forward some topics for contention, such as: "The role of trade unions at present" and "Why are trade union cadres not at ease with their work?" These are all topics that trade union cadres discuss endlessly on a daily basis.

The "topical contention" in some units in Shanghai revolves around a big-character poster or a specific event, and then expands. In the organs of the Putuo District Committee of Shanghai, a large-scale debate on cadre policy was launched around a big-character poster, which was conducted very enthusiastically.

### 使群众性的大鸣大放深入一步  上海采取了“专题争鸣”的办法

    使群众性的大鸣大放深入一步
    上海采取了“专题争鸣”的办法
    本报上海28日电　如何使群众性的大鸣大放更加深入一步？上海已经展开整风运动的机关和学校最近采取的一种“专题争鸣”的形式，已证明是一个可行的办法。
    “专题争鸣”（有的叫“专题辩论”），是在大鸣大放已经相当充分的基础上才提出来的，目的是为了使争鸣更加深入，并且集中到主要问题上去。上海第一师范学院自9月上旬开始大鸣大放后，十多天来群众已贴出大字报三千多张，召开大小会议九百多次，还有一百七十多人在“广播台”上发表了意见，提出的问题已经很多，但好些问题还需要深入挖掘。学校领导上便决定一方面继续用大字报、座谈会等形式发动群众，提意见；同时又采用“专题争鸣”的形式，对几个师生们最关心而意见分歧又大的问题，如“教师的社会地位问题”，“农村问题”等展开了深入的争辩。
    上海第二医学院党委综合研究了群众提出的五千二百多条意见之后，归纳了“教学改革与学习苏联”“党能不能领导高等教育”“大学生的劳动观点”等八个专题，进一步展开争鸣。
    “专题争鸣”的题目一定要出得好，抓得准。要真正接触到本单位工作中和思想上的根本问题；必须是真正为群众普遍关心而又未解决的问题。这样才能使争鸣热烈展开，并取得最好的成效。上海交通大学提出的一个专题是“什么是交通大学的传统？应当怎样继承交通大学的传统？”这个题目就很好，它提出了交大工作中的根本问题，而交大师生们对这个问题的认识是很不一致的。上海市工会联合会和一些产业工会，在研究了群众的大量意见之后，也提出了一些争鸣的专题，如：“当前工会的作用”、“工会干部为什么不安心工作？”这些都是工会干部们日常议论不休的题目。
    上海有的单位的“专题争鸣”，围绕着一张大字报，一个具体事件，然后展开。上海普陀区委机关里就是围绕着一张大字报，展开了关于干部政策的大辩论，进行得非常热烈。
