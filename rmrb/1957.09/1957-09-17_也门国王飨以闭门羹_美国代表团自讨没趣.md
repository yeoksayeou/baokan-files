Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 14th: TASS reported that, according to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, the King of Yemen, Imam Ahmad, refused to receive the official U.S. delegation that came to Yemen to provide "American economic aid."

King Ahmad initially agreed to the U.S. delegation's visit to Yemen, originally thinking that the "aid" offered by the United States would not be attached with political or military conditions, such as requiring Yemen to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Later, he learned that the United States intended to provide "aid" according to the "Eisenhower Doctrine," so King Ahmad refused to meet with the U.S. delegation.

　　也门国王飨以闭门羹  美国代表团自讨没趣
    据新华社15日讯　塔斯社开罗14日讯：据“金字塔报”报道，也门国王伊马姆：艾哈迈德拒绝接见为向也门提供“美国经济援助”来到也门的美国官方代表团。
    国王艾哈迈德当初同意美国代表团访问也门，他原来以为，美国提供的“援助”没有附带政治或军事条件，像要也门接纳“艾森豪威尔主义”等。后来才知道美国打算按照“艾森豪威尔主义”提供“援助”，艾哈迈德国王于是拒绝同美国代表团会谈。
