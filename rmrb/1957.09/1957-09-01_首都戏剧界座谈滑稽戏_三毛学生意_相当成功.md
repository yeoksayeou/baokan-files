Capital Theater Circles Discuss Comic Drama
"San Mao Goes into Business" is Quite Successful

(Our Newspaper) Beijing - The Chinese Dramatists Association held a symposium in the capital yesterday on Shanghai comic opera performances. Tian Han, Chen Baichen, Feng Zi, Hou Baolin, and other major actors from the Shanghai Popular Comic Drama Troupe, a total of more than twenty people, attended the meeting.

At the meeting, everyone believed that the Popular Comic Drama Troupe's performance of "San Mao Goes into Business" in Beijing was quite successful. In particular, the barber shop scene, with Wen Binbin's portrayal of San Mao, was rich in movement and wonderfully performed, with some parts reminiscent of the performance techniques of the comedy master Charlie Chaplin. This has brought comic opera to a new achievement and opened up a new path for comedy in our country.

Comrade Tian Han said that the main characteristic of comic opera is to make people laugh. The socialist era needs laughter; laughter can enrich people's spiritual life and make them optimistic. However, one-sided pursuit of laughter is not good and one must avoid vulgar and low-level tendencies. Comedy requires more exaggerated performance techniques than general drama, but exaggeration and magnification are different. We must correctly and appropriately handle artistic exaggeration.

Although comic opera is welcomed by the vast majority of the audience, there is currently a great lack of scripts. Many people at the meeting requested that playwrights be able to pay attention to and write scripts for comic drama. The development of this genre still needs to obtain care and help from new literary and art workers in all aspects. (Yun)

    首都戏剧界座谈滑稽戏
    “三毛学生意”相当成功
    本报讯  中国戏剧家协会昨天在首都召开上海滑稽戏演出座谈会。田汉、陈白尘、凤子、侯宝林等以及上海市大众滑稽剧团的主要演员共二十余人出席了这个会。
    会上，大家认为：大众滑稽剧团这次在北京演出的“三毛学生意”相当成功。特别是其中理发店一场，文彬彬扮演的三毛动作丰富，演得十分精采，有些地方颇有滑稽大师卓别麟的表演手法。这使滑稽戏达到了新的成就，也为我国的喜剧开辟了一条新的道路。
    田汉同志说，滑稽戏主要的特点是使人发笑。社会主义时代需要笑，笑可以丰富人民的精神生活，使人乐观。但是，片面的追求笑是不好的，要避免低级、庸俗的倾向。喜剧比一般戏剧更需要夸张的表演手法，但夸张和夸大不同。我们必需正确、恰当地来处理艺术上的夸张。
    滑稽戏虽然受到广大观众的欢迎，但目前非常缺乏剧本，很多人在会上要求剧作家们能够重视并为滑稽戏剧作剧本。这个剧种的发展，还需取得新文艺工作者从各方面的关怀和帮助。 （匀）
