    After nearly three months of reasoned struggle, the Sichuan rightist camp, which has suffered a crushing blow, has now completely disintegrated. A powerful anti-rightist army, with the support of workers and peasants throughout the province, has exposed many rightists from various democratic parties, all walks of life, and provincial, municipal, and prefectural-level organs, universities, central government agencies stationed in the province, large factories and mines, and middle school teachers.

    In this arduous struggle, the battle to besiege the Sichuan branch of the Zhang-Luo alliance was of decisive significance. The rightist leading core of the China Democratic League headed by Pan Dakui and the seven or eight small groups under his command extended many black lines connecting rightist members in grassroots organizations. They also extended their tentacles to various aspects outside the League, contacting and wooing rightists among democratic parties, non-party members, and intellectuals, forming a black army camp from top to bottom, coordinating with each other, and launching attacks on the Party. Therefore, at the beginning of the counterattack, the focus was on defeating the invisible organizational core and small groups of the rightist group in the China Democratic League. Then, rightists in the leading organs of the provincial and municipal democratic parties, such as Li Zixiang, Wu Feibai, Qiu Zhushuang, and Deng Mingshu of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), Guo Zhongheng, Zhang Mingfan, and Jiang Xuan of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Lin Quanjiao, Huang Xianzhang, Li Zhongping, and Zhong Yunhe of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), Fan Yingshi of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Gao Xingya, a non-party member, were exposed. At the same time, a large number of rightists were also exposed in the fields of literature and art, news publishing, health, culture and education, industry, politics and law, and finance and economics, and the outer strongholds of right-wing groups such as the "Hundred Flowers Poetry Society" and the "Chengdu Women's Temperance Society" were removed. As the struggle deepened, rightists hidden within the Party, such as Wen Tianfeng, Fan Shuomo, Bai Hang, Chen Xinyi, and Wang Tingquan, were also exposed. In the first phase of the struggle, the conspiracies and activities of the rightist leading backbone against the Party and the people were promptly crushed, thereby breaking the spine of the reactionary groups in the province and completely isolating the rightists.

    The rapid defeat of the Sichuan rightist camp was primarily due to the adoption of internal and external attacks, coordinated assaults from above and below, and first breaking through the weak points of the rightist camp. Before May, the Pan Dakui group had deployed arson in universities and many small and medium-sized cities. Therefore, the anti-rightist struggle began in the grassroots organizations of the China Democratic League. The initial exposure of the conspiratorial activities of rightists in Ya'an, Neijiang, and Nanchong promoted the encirclement and suppression of the provincial-level rightist leading core. The exposure of Zhao Yiming's and Shu Jun's "Local Design Plan" and the ten-point arson instruction further promoted the deepening of the struggle. Secondly, the active participation of the broad masses of workers and peasants in the struggle was of great significance to achieving victory. The working class of Chongqing and Chengdu, as the vanguard of the struggle, were the first to rise up to counterattack the rightists. They also used big-character posters to support students in reasoned struggle. Farmers in Jintang and Qingshen counties directly provided materials on the crimes of the rightists and helped organs and schools expose the bottom line of the rightist backbone. The people of Ya'an used their own just actions to smash the provocations of the rightists. Rectification while correcting mistakes is a huge driving force for mobilizing the masses to deeply engage in the anti-rightist struggle. Organs, schools, and enterprises in the province and cities have generally improved the shortcomings of welfare, wage levels, and leadership style in an in-depth way. In the 18 enterprises in Chengdu, more than 700 opinions raised by the masses have been resolved. For example, the Chengdu Timber Factory, by promptly resolving 19 of the most pressing issues, encouraged and educated the masses, enabling wavering middle elements to quickly join the struggle and expose the rightist Chen Qiwu. Because the movement always adhered to reasoning and presenting facts, the rightist words and deeds were thoroughly criticized and exposed. Overcoming sentimentality, preventing crude and simple methods, strictly distinguishing boundaries, and realistically classifying rightists are guarantees for the healthy progress of the movement. For example, the Leshan area corrected deviations in a timely manner through inspection and re-ranking.

    After this period of struggle, although the rightist camp in the province has been divided and disintegrated and has begun to lay down its arms, many rightists have not yet completely surrendered and confessed. A more arduous struggle lies ahead. At present, the struggle is deepening at the grassroots level.

    上下夹击  内外会攻  工农群众支援斗争
    四川省右派阵营已全线瓦解
    斗争中坚持讲道理摆事实使右派言论受到彻底揭露和批驳
    克服温情主义防止简单粗暴严格区分界限使运动健康进行
    本报成都31日电  经过近三个月的说理斗争，受到歼灭性打击的四川右派阵营，现已全线瓦解。一支强大的反右派大军，在全省工农群众支援下，已从各民主党派、各行各业和省市地专各级机关、大专学校、中央驻省机关、大型厂矿及中学教师中揭发出许多右派分子。
    在这一艰巨的斗争里，具有决定意义的战斗是对于章罗联盟四川分店的围攻。以潘大逵为首的民盟右派领导核心及其所统率的七八个小集团，伸出许多黑线联系着基层组织中的右派成员，他们还把自己的触角伸到盟外各个方面去，联络拉拢民主党派无党派和社会知识分子中的右派，从上而下结成黑军阵营，相互策应，向党发起进攻。因之反击一开始，首先集中打垮民盟中右派集团的无形组织核心小集团，接着又进一步把省市民主党派领导机构中的右派，如民革的李紫翔、伍非百、丘翥双、邓明枢，农工民主党的郭仲衡、张明泛、姜瑄，民建的林全九、黄宪章、李仲平、钟云鹤，民进的范英士，无党派高兴亚等揭发出来。与此同时，文艺、新闻出版、卫生、文教、工业、政法、财经等部门也拉出大批右派分子，拔掉“百花诗社”“成都妇女节制会”等右派集团的外围据点。随着斗争深入发展，隐藏在党内的右派温田丰、范硕默、白航、陈新贻、王廷全等也暴露出来了。第一期斗争中，由于及时粉碎了右派领导骨干反党反人民的阴谋活动，从而打断了全省反动集团的脊骨，把右派分子完全孤立起来。
    四川右派阵营能迅速击溃，首先是由于采取内外夹击、上下会攻、先攻破右派阵营的薄弱点。潘大逵集团5月前就在大专学校和许多中小城市部署放火，因之反右派斗争一开始便在民盟基层组织开展，雅安、内江、南充等地右派阴谋活动的初步揭发，又促进了对省级右派领导核心的围剿。赵一明、舒军的“地方设计方案”和十点放火指示的暴露，又进一步推动了斗争的深入发展。其次，广大工农群众积极参加斗争，对取得胜利具有重大意义。作为斗争先锋的重庆、成都工人阶级最早起来向右派进行反击，他们并用大字报支援学生进行说理斗争，金堂、青神县的农民还直接提供右派的罪行材料，帮助机关学校揭露右派骨干的老底。雅安人民则用自己的正义行动粉碎右派的挑衅。边整边改是发动群众深入反右派斗争的巨大动力，省市各机关学校企业，对福利工资级别及领导作风不深入的缺点都普遍作了改进。成都市十八个企业，在群众提出的意见中，已解决了七百多件。如成都制材厂通过及时解决十九件最迫切的问题，鼓舞教育了群众，就使观望的中间分子迅速投入斗争，把右派分子陈其武揭露出来。由于运动始终贯彻讲道理摆事实，因之使右派言行受到彻底批驳和揭露。克服温情主义，防止简单粗暴的作法，严格区别界限、实事求是地划分右派，是使运动健康进行的保证。如乐山专区通过检查、重新排队，及时纠正了偏向。
    经过这一时期的斗争，全省右派阵营虽已分化瓦解，开始放下武器，但不少右派还未彻底投降交代，更艰巨的斗争还在前面，目前斗争正在基层深入发展。
