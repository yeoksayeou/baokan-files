Getting an Early Start and Stepping Up Inspections
Pingshun and Xiangyang Do a Good Job Preparing for Wheat Planting
    (Our newspaper reports) Because Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, started early, its wheat planting preparation work is being done well.
    In late July, Pingshun County convened a meeting of commune directors, technical section chiefs, and experienced old farmers from twenty-eight townships, including Shicheng, Longzhen, Yangjingdi, and Beidanche, to summarize last year's wheat yield increase experiences and the lessons learned from wheat yield reductions in some communes.  Immediately afterwards, a general inspection of wheat preparation work was launched. This inspection was carried out by more than 150 cadres working in the townships in two batches, as well as some township and commune cadres.
    According to the inspection, by August 20, all 11,830 mu of wheat land in the county had been plowed once, and 8,300 mu had been plowed twice; a total of 600,000 jin of improved wheat seeds, both adjusted and self-retained, was available, more than enough; the plan to apply 85 dan of fertilizer per mu was nearing completion. However, it was also found that some townships and communes did not pay enough attention to wheat preparation work. For example, in Sitou and other places, the second plowing had just begun, and only half the fertilizer target had been met.
    Recently, the leading departments of Pingshun County sent another 20 cadres to the countryside to continue inspection and promotion together with the county and township cadres already working there, strengthening specific leadership over wheat sowing work.
    (Our newspaper reports) Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, has fully launched winter sowing preparations in its 600+ agricultural cooperatives.
    The county's 200,000+ mu of harvested land has now been universally harrowed and plowed two to three times.  To improve sowing quality, shorten the sowing period, and gradually promote wide-row sowing, the 150+ agricultural cooperatives in Xiangbei are repairing seeders and training seeder operators locally.  The carpentry groups in the Dongming, Dongyuan, and other eight cooperatives of Oumiao Township have not only repaired all 23 broken seeders, but also made 28 new ones.  All 61 production teams in the township have two seeders each.  In terms of seed preparation, efforts are being made to exchange and sun-dry seeds, striving to eliminate mixed varieties and ensure a germination rate of over 90%. Under the call of the county party committee, the county's farmers are taking advantage of the slack season to vigorously accumulate and create fertilizer. The farmers in the Jianggou district have not only planted green manure in the summer harvested land, but also require every household to fill their manure pits with zihao stalks. To ensure that the plowing cattle can adapt to the needs of winter sowing, in addition to dispatching people to purchase more cattle, the county's leading departments are organizing veterinarians to treat and prevent disease in the cattle, in order to prevent cattle from becoming weak and dying.

### 及早动手抓紧检查  平顺襄阳种麦准备工作做得好

　　及早动手抓紧检查
    平顺襄阳种麦准备工作做得好
    本报讯　山西省平顺县的小麦播种准备工作因为动手早，所以作得较好。
    7月下旬，平顺县就召开了石城、龙镇、羊井底、北耽车等二十八个乡的社主任、技术股长和种麦有经验的老农等举行了座谈，总结了去年的小麦增产经验和某些社小麦减产的教训。接着，即普遍开展了小麦准备工作大检查。这种检查是通过两批在乡工作的一百五十多个干部和一些乡、社干部进行的。
    据检查，到8月20日全县有一万一千八百三十亩正茬麦地全部耕完一遍，有八千三百亩耕下二遍；调剂和自留的小麦良种共六十万斤，已够用有余；肥料每亩施八十五担的计划已接近完成。但也发现有个别乡、社对小麦准备工作重视不够，如寺头等地耕二遍刚开始，肥料仅达一半。
    最近，平顺县的领导部门又派了二十名干部下乡，同原在乡工作的县、乡干部继续进行检查推动，加强对小麦播种工作的具体领导。
    本报讯　湖北省襄阳县六百多个农业社的冬播准备工作已全面展开。
    全县二十多万亩炕地现已普遍耖犁了两道至三道。襄北一百五十多个农业社为了提高播种质量、缩短播种期和逐步推行宽幅条播，正在修补耩子，就地训练耩子手。欧庙乡东明、东元等八个社的木工小组，除全部修整了二十三部坏耩子外，又新做了二十八部。全乡六十一个生产队，队队达到了两部耩子。在种子准备方面，正在大力调换和翻晒，争取消灭杂种，使出芽率达90％以上。全县农民在县委的号召下，乘挂锄期间突击积肥和造肥，姜沟区农民不但在夏炕地里种上了绿肥，还要求家家的粪坑里将籽篙打满。为了使耕牛能适应冬播的需要，县的领导部门除抽人出外添购外，还组织兽医给牛治疗、防疫，以免牛只病弱死亡。
