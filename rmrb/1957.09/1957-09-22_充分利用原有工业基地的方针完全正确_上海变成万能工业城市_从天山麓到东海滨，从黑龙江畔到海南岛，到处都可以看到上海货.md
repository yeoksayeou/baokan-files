Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 21st. Xinhua News Agency reporters He Changhua and Zhou Li reported on the achievements of Shanghai's industry during the First Five-Year Plan, saying: From the tremendous role Shanghai's industry has played in these five years, it proves that the Party and the state's policy of fully utilizing existing industrial bases is completely correct.

Shanghai was responsible for one-fifth of the country's industrial production tasks during the First Five-Year Plan. The total industrial output value of Shanghai nearly doubled during the First Five-Year Plan. The proportion of production materials in the total industry has risen from 25.4% in 1952 to 36.6% in 1956, and there has been new growth this year.

Shanghai, which in the past was mainly a textile industry processing foreign cotton and developed abnormally, has now begun to form a comprehensive industrial city integrating heavy, light, and textile industries.

Shanghai provides the largest quantity and the most complete variety of industrial products to the whole country among all industrial cities in China. In these five years, Shanghai produced more than two million tons of steel and added more than 400 new ships to the inland and ocean routes; the machine tools produced can equip more than 200 large machinery factories in the inland; the AC generators produced can equip ten 50,000 kW power stations; the looms produced can equip thirty weaving mills with 2,000 looms each; the tires produced can be fitted to more than 90,000 large trucks. Shanghai-made equipment and materials can be seen on any construction site in China.

In the five years, Shanghai produced daily necessities that, if evenly distributed among the country's 600 million people, would allow each person to get 30 feet of cotton cloth, every five people to have two pairs of rubber shoes, and every eleven people to have a gold pen; six hundred thousand to nine hundred thousand families each have a sewing machine and a bicycle. From the foothills of the Tianshan Mountains to the shores of the East China Sea, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to Hainan Island, Shanghai goods can be seen in every city and town throughout the country.

Shanghai's industry, with its long history, has made unprecedented improvements in manufacturing level in the past five years. The heavy industry has moved from repair and assembly to independently manufacturing complete sets of equipment, and is now beginning to move from imitation to the higher stage of self-design. Light industry and textile industry have also added a large number of new daily necessities from low-end to high-end, from scratch. The emergence of more than 10,000 new products and varieties, such as 6,000 kW and 12,000 kW complete sets of steam turbine generating equipment, precision grinders and instruments, special-shaped steel, new types of ships, large heavy-duty truck tires, antibiotics, raw materials for medicines, industrial paper, high-grade poplin, and cosmetics, has made Shanghai an all-purpose industrial city, playing a huge role in supporting national construction and meeting the needs of people's lives.

Wherever there is large-scale construction, there are workers and engineering and technical personnel sent by Shanghai. In the past five years, Shanghai has transferred a total of more than 240,000 talents to other places, including more than 25,000 engineering and technical personnel. The complete set of management cadres and workers of major trades required by the newly built and under construction steam turbine plants, boiler plants, antibiotic plants, etc. in our country are all drawn and trained by Shanghai. Factories and enterprises in many regions of the country have sent people to Shanghai every year in recent years to learn advanced experience; many excellent workers in Shanghai also accept invitations from other places and often go out to impart experience.

In the past five years, Shanghai has accumulated a total of more than 17 billion yuan in funds. The materials exported by Shanghai have also earned a large amount of foreign exchange for the country.

Shanghai is an important birthplace of China's modern industry. In the 105 years after the opening of the port in 1843, imperialist capital, bureaucratic capital, and national capital took Shanghai as a stronghold of competition, and blindly opened many factories and enterprises here. Because Shanghai's industry was developed on a semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic basis, it originally had many congenital weaknesses: although there were many factories, they were not systematic; light industry accounted for the largest proportion, and the heavy industry foundation was very weak; industrial raw materials depended on overseas imports. In the year before liberation, Shanghai's industry was almost completely paralyzed.

After liberation, the Party and the state, according to the needs of construction, systematically transformed Shanghai's industry, making it embark on a path of healthy development and ushering in unprecedented prosperity. In the past few years, Shanghai's industry has brought into play its advantages of having many equipment, great potential, high technical level, complete types of work, and convenient cooperation. At the same time, preliminary economic reorganization was carried out on more than 20,000 newly established joint ventures; backward equipment and technology were also transformed, and many socialist enterprise management systems were established, so that Shanghai's total industrial output value this year has increased by 2.7 times compared with 1949.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, Shanghai, an industrial base, will further play its role. Industries with relatively good original foundations will continue to be fully utilized; some industries that the country urgently needs but have a weak foundation will also be reasonably developed in the future. Recently, Vice Mayor Song Jiwen said in a report that Shanghai will be built into a base for five industries: chemical industry, precision machinery and instruments, shipbuilding, small steel, and radio, and will also become a base for trial-producing new products.

### 充分利用原有工业基地的方针完全正确  上海变成万能工业城市  从天山麓到东海滨，从黑龙江畔到海南岛，到处都可以看到上海货

    充分利用原有工业基地的方针完全正确
    上海变成万能工业城市
    从天山麓到东海滨，从黑龙江畔到海南岛，到处都可以看到上海货
    新华社上海21日电　新华社记者贺昌华、周立报道上海工业在第一个五年计划期间的成就时说：从上海工业这五年中所发挥的巨大作用来看，证明党和国家提出的充分利用原有工业基地的方针是完全正确的。
    我国第一个五年计划期间的工业生产任务，有五分之一是由上海担负的。上海工业总产值在第一个五年计划期间增长了将近一倍。生产资料生产占全部工业的比重，已经从1952年的25.4％上升到1956年的36.6％，今年又有新的增长。
    过去以加工外国棉花的纺织工业为主体的、畸形发展起来的上海，现在已经开始形成为一个重、轻、纺工业的综合性工业城市。
    上海提供给全国的工业品，数量在我国所有的工业城市中居第一位，品种也最齐全。这五年，上海生产的钢材有两百多万吨，并且给内河和外洋各条航线上增加了四百多艘新船；出产的机床能供内地装备两百多个大型机械厂；出产的交流发电机可以装备十个五万瓩的电站；出产的织布机可以装备三十个有两千台布机的织布厂；生产的轮胎可以装配九万多辆大卡车。在我国任何一个建设工地上，都可以看到上海制造的设备和器材。
    上海五年中生产的生活日用品，如果以全国六亿人口平均分配，每人能够得到三十尺棉布，每五人有两双胶鞋，每十一人有一枝金笔；六十万到九十万个家庭每一家有一架缝纫机和一辆自行车。从天山麓到东海滨，从黑龙江畔到海南岛，全国每一个城市和乡镇，都可以看到上海货。
    具有悠久历史的上海工业，五年来制造水平有了空前的提高。重工业已经由修理、装配走上了独立制造成套设备的道路，现在又开始从仿造向自行设计的更高阶段跨进。轻工业和纺织工业也从低级到高级、从无到有地增加了大量新的日用品。六千瓩和一万二千瓩成套的汽轮发电设备，精密的磨床和仪表，特殊形状的钢材，新型船舶，大型载重汽车轮胎，抗生素，原料药，工业用纸，高级的府绸和化妆品等一万多种新产品和新品种的涌现，使上海变成了一个万能的工业城市，在支援国家建设和满足人民生活需要中发挥了巨大的作用。
    哪里有大规模的建设，哪里就有上海支援去的工人和工程技术人员。五年来，上海已经外调的人材总数有二十四万多人，其中有两万五千多名工程技术人员。我国新建的和正在建设中的汽轮机厂、锅炉厂、抗生素厂等所需要的成套管理干部和主要工种的工人，都是由上海抽调和培养的。国内许多地区的工厂企业，几年来年年派人来上海学习先进经验；上海许多优秀工人还接受外地的邀请，经常出去传授经验。
    这五年，上海积累的资金总数达一百七十亿多元。由上海出口的物资还为国家换回了大量的外汇。
    上海是我国近代化工业的重要发源地。1843年开埠以后的一百零五年间，帝国主义资本、官僚资本和民族资本以上海为竞争的据点，在这里盲目地开设了许多工厂企业。由于上海工业是在半殖民地、半封建的经济基础上发展起来的，本来有许多先天的弱点：工厂虽然多，但是不成体系；比重最大的是轻工业，重工业基础十分薄弱；工业原料仰求海外进口。在解放的前一年，上海工业几乎全部陷于瘫痪状态。
    解放以后，党和国家根据建设的需要，有步骤地改造着上海的工业，使它走上了健康发展的道路，出现了空前未有的繁荣。几年来，上海工业发挥了它的设备多、潜力大、技术水平较高、工种齐全、协作方便等优点。同时，对两万多家新实行合营的工厂作了初步的经济改组；落后的设备和技术也进行了改造，并且建立了许多社会主义企业的管理制度，从而使上海今年的工业总产值比1949年增长二点七倍。
    第二个五年计划期间，上海这一个工业基地将进一步发挥它的作用。原来基础比较好的行业将继续加以充分利用；有些产品国家非常需要而基础又较薄弱的行业，今后也将作合理的发展。最近，宋季文副市长在一次报告中说，上海将建成为化学、精密机械及仪表、造船、小型钢材、无线电等五种工业的基地，并且还要成为试制新产品的基地。
