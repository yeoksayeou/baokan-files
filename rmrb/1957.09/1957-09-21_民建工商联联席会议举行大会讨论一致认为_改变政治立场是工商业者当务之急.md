Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Central Committee and the National Industry and Commerce Executive Committee held a joint conference this morning for general discussions. Seventeen people spoke at the meeting.

Everyone unanimously agreed that after a week of study and discussion, they had gradually realized in their minds that it was very timely and necessary to launch a rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sectors, focusing on opposing rightists, breaking with the capitalist stance, and establishing a socialist stance. They requested that the political stance issue of the industrial and commercial sectors be resolved through this movement.

Some committee members, in their speeches, related to their own ideological situations, illustrating that only by continuing to accept transformation and taking the socialist road could they find a bright future. Hu Juewen said, "I am a member of the bourgeoisie, and I still have a lot of bourgeois ideological sentiments. I must continue to accept transformation." Sheng Pihua said that in the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen, because their ideological consciousness lags far behind the changes in their economic status, it is inevitable that they are physically in socialism but mentally in capitalism. He said that he was greatly shocked when Minister Li Weihan pointed out that this was a struggle between the capitalist and socialist roads, and he felt the seriousness of the problem. Liu Guojun said that he thought he had fulfilled his responsibility to the country by handing over his enterprise to the state, and he was very complacent, thinking that there was no problem with his political stance. During the period of great blooming and contending, he himself had some erroneous remarks that resonated with the rightists. This shocked him and made him feel that industrialists and businessmen still need to continue to strengthen their transformation.

In their speeches, the committee members talked about their understanding in the anti-rightist struggle, as well as some of their experiences with the principles and policies of the rectification movement. Gong Tianmin talked about how his ideological understanding gradually improved as he participated in the struggle against the rightist leader Zhang Naiqi. Zhang Jingli said that when helping the Communist Party with rectification, because he was worried about gains and losses and feared being blamed for saying too much, he did not adopt a positive and sincere attitude. When the rightists rampantly attacked the Communist Party and socialism, because he did not see the reactionary nature of the rightists, he did not feel righteous indignation. He said that if he does not change his original position and stand on the socialist position, it would be impossible to have a common language and emotion with party members and workers, and it would be impossible to achieve the goal of self-transformation. Han Wangdao believes that the current political task of industrialists and businessmen is to be determined to change their political stance and truly stand on the side of socialism.

    民建工商联联席会议举行大会讨论一致认为
    改变政治立场是工商业者当务之急
    据新华社20日讯　中国民主建国会中央委员会和全国工商联执行委员会联席会议，今天上午举行大会讨论。在会上发言的有十七人。
    大家一致认为经过一星期来的学习和讨论，使大家从思想上逐步认识到当前在工商界全面开展一个以反对右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为内容的整风运动，是非常适时和必要的，要求通过这个运动解决工商界的政治立场问题。
    有些委员的发言，联系到自己的思想情况，说明只有继续接受改造和走社会主义道路才是光明的道路。胡厥文说：“我是资产阶级的一分子，还有不少资产阶级思想感情，必须继续接受改造。”盛丕华说，在绝大多数的工商业者中，由于思想意识远远落在经济地位变化的后面，就难免有身在社会主义，心在资本主义的情况发生。他说，他直到李维汉部长指出这是资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争时，才大吃一惊，感到问题的严重。刘国钧说，他自以为把企业交给国家，对国家就算尽了一点责任，很自满，认为自己政治立场已没有问题了；在大鸣大放的时候，自己却有一些和右派共鸣的错误言论，这才使自己吃惊，感到工商业者还要继续加强改造。
    委员们的发言中，都谈到自己在反右派斗争中的认识，以及对整风运动方针政策的一些体会。巩天民谈他在参加对右派头子章乃器的斗争中，逐步提高思想认识的情况。张敬礼说，在帮助共产党整风时，由于自己患得患失，唯恐多言取咎，因而没有采取积极、诚恳的正确态度。当右派分子猖狂向共产党向社会主义进攻时，由于自己看不到右派的反动本质，也就没有引起义愤。他说，如果不改变原有的立场，站在社会主义立场上来，就不可能和党员、工人有共同的语言和感情，也就不可能达到脱胎换骨自我改造的目的。韩望道认为工商业者当前的政治任务，就是要下决心改变自己的政治立场，真正的站到社会主义这一边来。
