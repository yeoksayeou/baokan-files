The editorial board notes: Comrade N. Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, spoke on the issue of literature and art at the CPSU Central Committee's meeting with writers on May 13, 1957, at the reception for writers, artists, sculptors, and composers on May 19, and at the Party's active members' meeting in July. The Soviet magazine "Communist" published a summary of Comrade Khrushchev's speeches on these occasions under the title "Literature and Art Must Maintain Close Ties with the People's Lives" in its 12th issue. The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" reprinted this article on August 28. We are now translating and publishing it below:

The Communist Party, following Lenin's directive that literature and art are an integral part of the struggle for communism, has always considered the activities of writers, artists, sculptors, composers, and all Soviet cultural workers to be of paramount importance. The prosperity of our multi-ethnic Soviet socialist culture is also of paramount importance.

The strength of Soviet literature and art lies in their connection with the lives of the people and their struggle for the cause of communism. The 20th Congress of the CPSU pointed out that our literature and art workers are faithful assistants of the Communist Party in realizing the great task of building a new society and in educating the working people in the spirit of communism.

When studying the development of literature and art, one cannot ignore the urgent tasks that the Communist Party and the Soviet people must solve in further improving our country's economy and culture and in struggling to build a communist society.

I

Everyone knows that the 20th Congress of the CPSU set forth major tasks in the development of industry, agriculture, cultural construction, and the improvement of the people's living standards. Although the Congress has only recently concluded, the achievements made in implementing the directives set by the Congress in this short period have indeed been tremendous. Our industry is successfully executing the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Many bourgeois politicians frankly admit that the speed of growth of Soviet industry causes them fear, and the great influence of the Soviet example on the working people of the whole world makes them anxious. You and I both know how convincingly our example influences the minds of the working people of the world.

Not long ago, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR held a meeting to discuss the reorganization of the management of industry and construction. The meeting pointed out that in the years of Soviet power, the production of industrial goods in our country has increased twenty-nine times, the production of machine-building and metalworking has increased one hundred seventy-nine times, and the production of electric power has almost increased ninety-nine times.

These materials eloquently prove that our country, by advancing along the path indicated by Lenin, has become a powerful socialist state. The measures currently being implemented to reorganize the management of industry and construction are of great significance for the further development of the Soviet economy.

By shifting the focus of industrial management to the local level, it is possible to lead the economy more concretely and effectively, to further mobilize the initiative of the masses, and to enhance the role and responsibility of local authorities. Today, the problems of enterprises and construction sites are no longer solved by the ministries and chief administrations but are directly solved on the spot in the economic regions.

I think that on this issue, perhaps not everyone agrees with my opinion. Some people openly talk about this, while others may remain silent. That is their business. One must remember that when the Communist Party and our government decided to cultivate virgin lands, not everyone understood the significance of this matter. The same is true for the reorganization of industrial management. Some people opposed this. This is a manifestation of conservatism. The old is convenient, people have become accustomed to it, but the outdated, old things must be destroyed. We cannot live according to the old ways; we must move forward.

If the Soviet people have achieved great success in the cultivation of virgin lands, then the measures to improve our industrial work, which the Communist Party is currently implementing, will certainly achieve even greater success. The reorganization of economic management that we are implementing will bring not only material benefits to the Soviet people but will also lead to a new cultural flourishing, because cultural forces will be more evenly distributed, and the centers of economic regions will grow faster into cultural centers.

After the outline of the report on the reorganization of the management of industry and construction was published, some writers showed a lack of understanding of the new processes taking place in our lives and were not sufficiently prepared to correctly assess the situation of the entire national economy at this stage, when there is an urgent need to improve the forms of industrial management. In this regard, these writers also showed a detachment from life. However, I believe that life will soon tell these comrades that they are wrong.

In recent years, the Party has paid great attention to the development of our agriculture. You know that a few years ago, our agriculture was in a very difficult situation. You probably remember that when the September Plenum of the Central Committee in 1953 openly and frankly discussed the shortcomings in the leadership of agriculture, the capitalists in our enemy countries made such a clamor and uproar. The enemy shouted that this was the collapse of the collective farms, the collapse of our entire cause.

In these years, the Party and the entire Soviet people have done tremendous work in the development of agriculture. Now, every Soviet person has tasted the fruits of this work. Why has our agriculture been so seriously lagging behind for a long time? This is because there was no one in the center who truly wanted to understand the real situation in the localities. Everyone knows that Stalin went nowhere, did not consult with agricultural workers, did not listen to the voices of local workers, and those who were entrusted by Stalin to supervise agriculture in the center hid the enormous shortcomings from Stalin and only deceived and covered up. The principle of material interest of collective farm members and all agricultural workers in increasing agricultural production was seriously violated.

Let me give a few examples. Not long after the war, I returned to my hometown to visit my relatives. She had a garden. I said to her:
“You have several very good apple trees.”
She replied:
“In the autumn, I will cut them all down.”
I asked: “Why?”
She said: “The tax is too high, it is not worth it to tend the garden.”
I reported this conversation to Stalin, telling him that collective farm members were cutting down orchards. And he later told me that I was a populist, that I had populist views, that I had lost my proletarian class instinct.

Another example. We sent tens of thousands of people from the cities to the collective farms to harvest potatoes, while the collective farm members themselves did not harvest. Was there such a situation? Yes, there was. Why did the collective farm members not want to harvest potatoes? Because when purchasing potatoes, we paid a very low price. The cost of transporting potatoes to the procurement stations by the collective farms was higher than the value they received from selling potatoes.

We had to change this situation and set a reasonable price standard to encourage collective farmers materially to care about agricultural production. Without material encouragement for collective farmers, there would not be much progress. When talking about such products as grain, meat, oil, and potatoes, which are directly related to the people's livelihood, one cannot forget this. However, unfortunately, we sometimes encounter some “old diehards” here who cannot understand this. Those who are detached from life and indifferent to the interests of the people cannot understand that adherence to old ways will ruin things and bring irreparable damage to the interests of the people. There are also such people among the workers of the ideological front. They are prisoners of obsolete ideas, prisoners of formulas, dogmas, and theorems from books.

One must admit that the trivial philosophical ideas from books are quite persistent. We still often feel their presence in our work. People with such views are afraid of everything new, they shout and make noise, they panic, lose the ability to calmly analyze the situation, and are unable to understand the measures that must be taken to realize the requirements of the development of society. When the Central Committee suggested introducing a new planning system in agriculture, conservatives came out to oppose this measure. They tried to frighten the Central Committee, threatening that if we did not draw up plans for sowing crops from the center, then the collective farmers would stop sowing wheat, and we would have no grain. These conservatives were ridiculed by actual life. Millions of collective farmers enthusiastically supported the new planning system, actively engaged in this work, and as a result, we gained great benefits.

The 20th Congress of the Party showed that now our country has all the necessary conditions to solve the basic economic tasks of the USSR in a very short historical period—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of production per capita. Lenin, on the eve of the October Revolution, considered the solution of this task to be one of the most important tasks of a socialist state. After solving this task, it would be possible to further strengthen the economic power of the USSR and significantly raise the living standards of the people.

Our workers and peasants, following the Bolshevik Party and Lenin, fought in October 1917 to overthrow the rule of the landlords and capitalists in order to gain freedom and build a new and beautiful life. What does this beautiful life manifest? It manifests in the fact that people have become free citizens, masters of their own destiny; they work not for exploiters but for themselves, and they have sufficient conditions to live a cultured and prosperous life. The Communist Party considers it its primary duty to constantly care for the improvement of the well-being of the working people. Now our task is to ensure that the country has abundant grain, meat, oil, milk, and other necessities of life, as well as other consumer goods, in the coming years. You know that the Party is currently making great efforts to expand housing construction in cities and villages as much as possible to ensure that the working people of our country have well-equipped housing.

Due to the measures taken in recent years, our agriculture has now reached such a level of development that it can successfully solve the task of catching up with the United States in terms of meat, dairy, and oil production per capita in the coming years. What is the current situation with meat, oil, and dairy production in our country and the United States? In 1956, per capita, the Soviet Union produced 32.3 kilograms of meat, the United States 102.3 kilograms; we produced 2.8 kilograms of butter, the United States 3.8 kilograms; we produced 245 kilograms of milk, the United States 343 kilograms. From this, it is clear that we are currently far behind the United States in terms of oil, dairy, and especially meat production per capita. The figures I cited show what a daunting task we face. Can we solve this task? Pessimists scare us, saying that we seem to be carrying a burden beyond our strength. They do not believe in the potential of the socialist economy, do not understand our country, do not understand the souls of our people, and do not believe in the boundless strength of our people.

If we are afraid of the difficulties that arise in the struggle to improve the well-being of the people, we will not be worthy of being Communists, worthy of being students and successors of Lenin. We clearly understand that the tasks before us are daunting, but the Communist Party and the Soviet people will certainly accomplish this task. The basis of our firm conviction is that we have accurately assessed the real potential of socialist agriculture and considered the experience of advanced collective farms.

The tasks set by the Party have received the unanimous support and approval of the entire people. The creative spirit of the working people is flourishing throughout the country. Collective farm members guarantee to increase the production of meat, oil, and dairy products threefold, fivefold, tenfold, and even more—this is their answer to those who lack confidence and are pessimistic.

Now, the livestock industry of the collective farms is developing rapidly. In this situation, the Central Committee of the Party discussed the issue of abolishing the compulsory delivery of agricultural products from the personal economy of collective farmers starting from 1958. Now we have sufficient grounds to do this. The implementation of this measure is of great personal interest to millions of working people.

I would also like to talk about other measures taken by the Party to further improve the living conditions of the Soviet people. The rapid development of our industry, the continuous improvement of labor productivity, and the wide application of the latest achievements of science and technology for the mechanization of production have enabled us to recently switch to a seven-hour working day and to a six-hour working day in the underground part of the coal and mining industry. In capitalist countries, the result of the mechanization and automation of production is the deterioration of the living conditions of the working people, and mass unemployment in the working class. In our socialist state, the situation is completely different. The more perfect the production technology, the faster the social labor productivity increases, and the faster the living standards of the working people improve. After switching to a seven-hour working day, we will soon transition to a six-hour working day. This prospect is not far off. This will create more favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of spiritual culture and the comprehensive development of the personality of a citizen of a socialist society. The development of material culture is the foundation for the development of spiritual culture. A low level of material culture hinders the flourishing of the spiritual culture of the entire society. These two are interconnected.

The USSR is a multi-ethnic socialist state, fifteen equal brotherly union republics have voluntarily united to form this state. Formerly oppressed nations, having gained state independence on the path of socialist development, have had unlimited possibilities to develop their economy and culture and have made a leap forward in a short period. It must be frankly said that we have not yet vividly reflected the great, historically significant changes that have taken place in the lives of the peoples of our republics since the establishment of the Soviet power. In this regard, our literature and art workers owe the people a great debt. I suggest that writers and artists focus more on understanding the lives of the peoples of our country, delve into their lives. Then they will see thousands of vivid examples, see how much the fate of people has changed, see what outstanding achievements our people have made on the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

In recent years, I have visited Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan several times, and I have also been to Kyrgyzstan, to the Baltic republics—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. I have also been to Georgia, although this was a long time ago. Each of our union republics has achieved tremendous success in economic and cultural construction, and many qualified cadres have grown up.

How prosperous and brilliant are the economies and cultures of our Soviet republics! In the Soviet society, under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the process of the historically significant struggle for the cause of communism, such outstanding personalities have emerged! When you meet these people and talk to them, you will have such a sad and regretful feeling: in literary and artistic works, our writers and artists have indeed rarely successfully and worthily embodied the images of these people, rarely revealed that these are new people who have emerged and been educated in the socialist era. These new people are warriors for the freedom and happiness of mankind, they embody high spiritual qualities and the characteristics of communist morality. Strengthening the connection with the daily life of the people, strengthening the connection with the labor activities of the people, will help writers and artists change their old views of our people, help them understand the souls of the people, their characters, their thoughts, and aspirations, and create true and radiant images of modern people in novels, poetry, drama, cinema, painting, and music.

The 20th Party Congress, in its resolution, pointed out that in order to further raise and flourish the economy and culture, it is necessary to strive to expand the powers of the union republics and enhance their role, and to fully implement Lenin's national policy. After the Congress, the Party and the government have done a lot of work in this regard, and the results of this work have had a good impact on the life of the republics.

Here I would like to emphasize the most important measures taken by the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet government to expand the powers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Russian Federation deserves the respect due to it by the brotherly peoples of the USSR. The peoples of the USSR, who have taken the path of socialism together with the Russians, say with love: Mother Russia. Everyone knows that even before the revolution, outstanding representatives of the Russian democratic intelligentsia were closely connected with the advanced representatives of the intelligentsia of the peoples of Russia, actively rose up against national oppression, and had a beneficial influence on the cultural development of the peoples.

The heroic Russian working class, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, led the working people of the peoples to fight against the irreconcilable tsarist regime, against the bourgeois landlord regime, and ensured the victory of the socialist revolution. In the process of the great socialist transformation of our country, the Russian people did a lot of work to help the formerly oppressed peoples of the country overcome their long-standing economic and cultural backwardness and raise them to the same level as themselves. Whether in the period of peaceful construction or in the test of war, the great and noble deeds of the Russian people have earned them the warm gratitude and respect of the other peoples of our country. This in no way diminishes the outstanding role of the peoples of the USSR in the socialist family of brothers. Each of the peoples of the USSR has made a great contribution to the cause of communist construction. The invincible strength of the Soviet socialist state lies in the indestructible brotherly friendship of the peoples of the multi-ethnic Soviet state.

Comrades, it must be admitted that until recently, the Russian Federation did not have the full powers commensurate with its role and position in the state. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, this abnormal state of affairs has been corrected. The CPSU Central Committee Bureau for the Russian Federation has been established. This executive body of the CPSU Central Committee deals with all the affairs of the Russian Federation and represents the CPSU Central Committee in leading the work of the party, economic, and cultural departments of the Russian Federation. The Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation now has all the necessary powers to lead industry, agriculture, and cultural construction. Not long ago, the management of industry and construction was reorganized, and seventy national economic councils were established in the Russian Federation according to economic administrative districts, which can lead the economic development of the republic more concretely.

The measures to expand the powers of the union republics have great significance and provide broader possibilities for the comprehensive development of the union republics.

Comrades! Our strength lies in the unity of the ranks of our Party, in the indestructible unity of the peoples of the USSR, in their unity around the CPSU Central Committee. As long as we have such a firm, indestructible unity in our ranks, the machinations of any reactionary forces in the world are not to be feared.

Some adherents of “pure theory” try to portray the activities of our Party, the measures taken by our Party, as some kind of narrow practicalism. There are also some people among the writers who support this view. This error cannot be ignored. Let us analyze how to understand the connection between theory and practice from the standpoint of Marxism. No Marxist-Leninist has the idea of belittling the significance of revolutionary theory. Lenin once said that without revolutionary theory, there would be no revolutionary practice.

The theory of Marxism-Leninism is an expression of the fundamental interests of the working class, the fundamental interests of the working people. It is not a dogma but a guide to actual revolutionary movement. At each new stage of historical development, actual life poses tasks that arise from social demands. Creatively approaching theory, being able to develop and advance Marxist-Leninist science, lies in correctly understanding the new tasks that have matured in the process of social development on the basis of a scientific summary of actual experience, and pointing out the specific ways to realize these tasks.

The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU are a model of the creative development of Marxist-Leninist theory. The political line of our Party, as defined by the Congress, expresses the fundamental interests of the Soviet people in the current stage of their struggle for communism. The fundamental interest of the people is to ensure the further powerful development of socialist industry, primarily heavy industry, the rapid improvement of agriculture, and on this basis, to strive to improve the material well-being of the working people.

The measures taken by the Communist Party in recent years in the construction of the Party and the state, as well as in the development of the economy and the improvement of the living standards of the people, prove that the entire activity of our Party is based on the indivisible combination of theory and practice. In the late years of Stalin, this connection between theory and practice was disrupted. This is incomprehensible to those who are detached from life, those who consider themselves to be the expositors of Marxist-Leninist science, but in fact have broken with Leninism and have taken the path of factionalism, opposing the fundamental interests of the Party, the fundamental interests of the people. The June Plenum of the Central Committee exposed and ideologically crushed the anti-party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, and Shepilov, who participated in their gang, and the resolution of the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee was unanimously supported by the entire Party and the entire Soviet people because its purpose was to further strengthen the Leninist unity of the Party.

I know that there are some people who appear as theorists, but in essence, their entire “theoretical” wisdom is nothing more than quoting sentences from the classics of Marxism-Leninism. These poor scholars, who call themselves theorists, do not understand such an important Marxist truth that people, before engaging in political, scientific, and artistic activities, must first eat, drink, have a place to live, and have clothes to wear. These bookworms and pedants forget that the people seized power precisely to develop the productive forces more quickly, expand social wealth, improve their own well-being, and create better living conditions.

If Marx, Engels, and Lenin could be resurrected today, they would certainly laugh at these pedants who pick words and quote classics, because these people do not study modern social life, creatively develop theory, but only look for words in the works of the classics on how to deal with a certain region's machine-tractor stations. For example, to look for words in the works of Marx or Engels that can tell us how to handle the issue of collective farmers delivering their own agricultural products is laughable.

One must admit that among our economists and philosophers, there are some people who are detached from life, detached from the practice of communist construction. One can even encounter such economists who, when talking about wages under modern conditions, use examples that Marx cited in his famous work “Capital” about a hundred years ago. Of course, such people are not many, but unfortunately, sometimes one can still encounter them. Such economists cannot cite specific examples from life because they really do not understand life. These people are not theorists but parrots who only know how to repeat certain words over and over again. Such “theoretical” works are worthless.

We Communists are active revolutionaries, and we consider it our task to transform the world and build a communist society. The strength of our theory lies in the fact that it is closely connected with life, synthesizes the creative experience of millions of people, and protects the fundamental interests of the working people who make up the majority of the world's population. The strength of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in the fact that it is fundamentally revolutionary, it does not tolerate stagnation, conservatism, and lifelessness, it illuminates the path to the communist future, guides the peoples forward, and helps them overcome the difficulties and obstacles on the way to this goal.

Marxist-Leninists are creators of new life, people with great revolutionary thoughts, people who dare to imagine and are full of inspiring ideals. At the same time, they are people who stand firmly on the soil of reality, people of the world, they are politicians with clear minds, who consider all real conditions and possibilities in their activities, are not afraid of difficulties, do not hide contradictions, and dare to honestly and loyally tell the whole truth to their people, even if this truth is sometimes painful. The students and successors of Lenin, the Communists, undertake the fearless task of seeking the well-being of the people and strive with all their might to accomplish these tasks.

Comrades, let us recall how Lenin valued the practical activities of our Party in the development of the economy. He said that if we could produce one hundred thousand tractors, then the peasants would say that they support the commune, that is, they support communism. After the plan for the electrification of Russia was drawn up, Lenin called this plan the second program of our Party.

The great plan for communist construction, adopted by the 20th Congress of the Party, is our battle program of action in the current stage of the development of the state. These plans stipulate that the productive forces will be greatly developed on the basis of continuous technological progress, in order to greatly increase the production of consumer goods and take a new big step towards communism.

The implementation of the plans adopted by the 20th Congress of the Party has great international significance. It will be another fatal blow to the thinkers of the capitalist world, because these people widely use the materials on the per capita production of goods in the most developed capitalist countries, this temporary transitional factor, to carry out malicious attacks on socialism.

All honest and unbiased people see that with the flourishing development of our national economy, the gap in per capita production between our country and the most developed capitalist countries is narrowing year by year. Now our industrial output has reached the second place in the world. Even our enemies cannot deny the economic power of the USSR and its rapid economic development.

The outstanding achievements of the USSR, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries have made the enemies of socialism panic. The attraction of socialist ideas in the countries of the world is increasing precisely because of the achievements of the socialist countries, while the enemies of socialism say that socialist ideas even have supernatural qualities. For this reason, they often attribute the responsibility for events that have occurred in places where our footsteps have never been to us. The most important task of our ideological workers is to understand, comprehend, and correctly explain the essence of the great socialist transformation.

When talking about the tasks of ideological workers, one cannot avoid the issue of personal cult and the elimination of its consequences. Our condemnation of the personal cult of Stalin, which violates the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, has aroused widespread reactions both at home and abroad. The Soviet people, the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, and all our foreign friends have enthusiastically supported and unanimously supported the resolution of the 20th Party Congress and the famous decision of the CPSU Central Committee on the elimination of the consequences of the personal cult. The enemies of socialism tried to use the criticism of the personal cult to achieve their dirty purposes, launching malicious slander propaganda to attack our country, to attack the entire socialist camp. They tried to sow discord in the ranks of the fighters for peace, democracy, and socialism, to weaken the influence of Marxist-Leninist thought, to undermine the unity of the socialist camp countries, and to slander and defame the Communist Party in the eyes of the people. Now everyone sees that the vile plans of the enemies of socialism have met with a shameful failure.

The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries have timely exposed and unmasked the machinations of the imperialists and have dealt a fatal blow to those who instigated and organized ideological sabotage activities and to all opportunists who tried to revise the foundations of Marxism-Leninism.

In the sharp ideological struggle, our Soviet intelligentsia has proven itself to be politically mature, firm, and loyal to Marxist-Leninist thought, and together with the entire Soviet people, in the great struggle for the cause of communism, has shown unity and cohesion. However, it must be admitted that there are some people among the intelligentsia who have begun to waver in their positions and have shown some vacillation in assessing some complex ideological issues related to overcoming the consequences of the personal cult.

What is the cause of the wavering of some representatives of literary and artistic workers? In my opinion, this is because some comrades have one-sidedly and incorrectly understood the essence of the Party's criticism of the personal cult of Stalin. They try to portray this criticism as a general denial of Stalin's positive role in the life of our Party and state, they have taken the wrong path, with prejudice, they only look for the dark sides and errors in the history of the struggle of our people for the victory of socialism, while ignoring the achievements of the Soviet state in socialist construction, which have world-historical significance. In my conversation with the editor of the American “New York Times,” when answering his question, “What position will Stalin occupy in history?” I said that Stalin will occupy his due position in the history of the USSR. Stalin has serious shortcomings, but he is a loyal Marxist-Leninist, a loyal and steadfast revolutionary. In the later period of his activities, Stalin made many mistakes, but he did many beneficial things for our country, our Party, and the entire international workers' movement. Our Party and the Soviet people will remember Stalin and give him his due evaluation.

To correctly understand the essence of the Party's criticism of the personal cult, one must deeply understand that in the activities of Comrade Stalin, we see two aspects: one is the positive aspect, which we support and give it a high evaluation; the other is the negative aspect, which we criticize, condemn, and refute.

For a long time, Stalin held a leading position in the Central Committee of our Party. All his activities are closely connected with the realization of the great socialist transformation of our country. In these years, due to the implementation of Lenin's plan for socialist construction, the face of our country has undergone fundamental changes. We all remember what Russia was like before the great victory of the October Revolution. This was a country that was backward in economy and culture and had been reduced to a semi-colonial country by the tsarist regime. Now let us look at the Soviet state today! The USSR is a powerful socialist great power, which plays a decisive role in the process of world history and is deeply respected by the working people of the whole world.

The great achievements in the development of our country were achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee, and Stalin played a leading role in the Central Committee. The socialist construction of the USSR was realized in the environment of a sharp struggle with class enemies and their agents in the Party—Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, and bourgeois nationalists. This was a political struggle. The Party exposed these enemies of Leninism, enemies of the socialist construction of our country, and this was done correctly. In politics, they were condemned, and this condemnation was just.

In this struggle, Stalin did beneficial work. This cannot be erased from the history of the struggle of our working class, peasants, and intelligentsia for socialism, from the history of the Soviet state. Because of this, we value and respect Stalin. We have stood by Stalin's coffin and wept, and then our respect for Stalin was sincere. We now sincerely evaluate his positive role in the history of our Party and the Soviet state. Each of us has trusted Stalin, and this trust was based on such a conviction that the cause we were pursuing with Stalin was beneficial to the revolution, beneficial to the working class and all working people.

Our Party and all of us resolutely condemn Stalin's gross errors and wrong tendencies, which caused great damage to the cause of the Party and the people. We lost many honest and loyal people, workers of our Party and the Soviet state, who were slandered and suffered unjustly. Many of them, we have already restored their honor. The Party has condemned the incorrect methods of leadership that formed during the period of the personal cult, and has persistently striven to restore the norms and principles of party life and leadership of Lenin, and to strive to expand Soviet socialist democracy to the fullest extent.

The struggle against the enemies of Leninism was correct in its stance, yet Stalin committed these brutal and serious errors. Comrades, this is a complex issue. This is Stalin's tragedy, a tragedy that in many ways was caused by his personality, his character's major flaws. In his letter to the Party Congress in December 1922, Lenin pointed out these flaws. Stalin's flaws, especially in his later years, developed significantly. He severely disrupted the principles of Party life established by Lenin, ignored the principle of collective leadership, and made many of the most important decisions for the Party and the state unilaterally. His connections with cadres and the working masses weakened. These personal flaws of Stalin were exploited by the enemies of the Party and the people, the instigator Beria, to harm our cause, making the situation even more complicated.

Comrade Malenkov also has significant faults in this regard. He was completely influenced by Beria, becoming his shadow, a tool in Beria's hands. Comrade Malenkov, who held a high position in the Party and the state, not only did not stop Stalin but also cunningly utilized Stalin's weaknesses and habits in his later years. In many instances, he prompted Stalin to take actions that deserve severe condemnation.

Now, everyone is clear that the Party's work to eliminate the consequences of personality cult has great positive significance.

Criticizing the personality cult and eliminating its influence in ideological work has deeply affected creative workers, especially writers. This is quite natural.

Who felt the most and most acutely in this regard? Comrades, I believe the most affected are writers, artists, sculptors, composers, and other artistic workers. Among writers, those who felt it most deeply were those closest to the Party, to the Central Committee, and thus also to Stalin. This is closeness to the people, closeness to everything the people have done under the leadership of our Party. In the works of these writers, the Party and the people's struggles and victories were sincerely and truthfully depicted. In these works, the image of Comrade Stalin also often appeared. These authors did good deeds; they wished our Party well and, together with all the people, fought for the lofty communist ideal under the Party's leadership. Of course, in some instances, under the influence of the general situation during the period of personality cult, there were one-sided and unobjective depictions of Stalin in literary and artistic works, exaggerating his merits while not adequately reflecting the role of the Party and the people.

When the Party began to criticize the personality cult and Stalin's errors, some writers felt as if all their past creative work was incorrect. Some writers even had the idea of revising all their works. It must be admitted that among the intelligentsia, there are also those who, although they had not actively participated in the struggle for our cause in the past, now began to slander and criticize literary and artistic workers who sang the praises of the achievements of our people under the Party's leadership. They came up with insulting terms like "those who whitewash reality" and used them extensively, labeling all those who truthfully depicted our reality, the creative labor of the people, and their great victories, and those who created positive Soviet people in literary and artistic works.

Some comrades asked how to treat the Stalin Prizes received by our people. I believe that the prizes should be treated with respect, proudly wearing the honor badge of Stalin Prize winners. If I had received a Stalin Prize, I would wear this honor badge. There were errors in the work of awarding Stalin Prizes, and in some instances, the prizes were awarded to unqualified individuals. But this was an individual phenomenon. Except for a few exceptions, the Stalin Prizes awarded to scientists, literary and artistic workers were well-deserved.

It must be pointed out frankly and clearly that the Communist Party, in the past, present, and future, supports those writers and artists who sincerely serve their homeland, rejoice with the people in the achievements of socialist construction under the Party's leadership, and vividly depict these achievements in literary and artistic works.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that it is very beneficial and should be fully supported to hold comradely meetings and discussions with literary and artistic workers on major ideological issues. In recent meetings and discussions held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, writers and artists frankly and unreservedly discussed everything that concerned them, and I liked this very much. They spoke in an atmosphere of friendship, and their words were correctly understood. This form of interaction is extremely necessary for comradely exchange of views, and as a result, mutual understanding and consensus on some urgent problems in our lives and work can be achieved.

Why does the Party attach such importance to literary and artistic issues? Because literature and art play a very important role in the Party's ideological work and in the communist education of the working people. Writers, artists, sculptors, composers, film and theater artists, and all our intellectuals actively participate in the construction of Soviet society with their creations and serve the people faithfully. The Communist Party regards literary and artistic workers as its loyal friends, assistants, and reliable pillars in the ideological struggle. The Party cares about the prosperity, high ideological content, and artistic skill of literature and art. Our people need literary works, paintings, and music that reflect the enthusiasm for labor and are understood by the people. The method of socialist realism provides unlimited possibilities for creating such works. The Party is waging an irreconcilable struggle against the infiltration of alien ideas into literature and art and against hostile attacks on socialist culture.

Now, the complexity and uniqueness of the ideological struggle in the field of literature and art lie in the fact that we not only need to protect literature and art from external attacks but also need to prevent individual creative workers from trying to lead literature and art down the wrong path, making them deviate from the main line of development.

The main line of development is: literature and art must always be inseparably linked with people's lives, truly reflecting our rich and colorful socialist reality, and vividly and convincingly revealing the great transformative activities of the Soviet people, their noble aspirations and goals, and their noble moral qualities. The highest social mission of literature and art is to inspire the people to strive for new achievements in the construction of communism.

Comrades, it must be admitted that there are still some individuals among writers and artists who sometimes lose their bearings and deviate from the correct path. These people mistakenly and distortedly view the tasks of literature and art. They try to see things as if the mission of literature and art is only to find faults, mainly to talk about the negative aspects and dark sides of life, and to keep silent about everything positive. But it should be known that it is the positive, new, and progressive things in life that are the main things in the thriving socialist reality.

Those who hold such erroneous and harmful views and sentiments oppose those writers and artists who truthfully and vividly depict the flourishing development of Soviet society and the positive images of our contemporaries in their works. Those who are labeled as "those who whitewash reality" by nitpickers include writers like Grinberg and others.

We support those writers who take a correct stance in literature and depict the positive aspects of life. This does not mean that every work they write is without flaws and cannot be criticized. There may also be some individual errors in the creative work of these comrades, but this does not give anyone the right and reason to scold them and deny the beneficial things they have done.

Perhaps someone will try to interpret the evaluation of facts and phenomena in literary life as a call to reflect life one-sidedly and conceal the shortcomings and difficulties in our reality. But we will resolutely eliminate such malicious intentions from the start.

No one can accuse us communists of fearing criticism and trying to cover up and conceal the shortcomings in our work. Historical experience proves: fear of criticism and self-criticism is the nature of the declining class and its parties. The Communist Party, as the political leader of the most advanced class, as the leader of the people building communism, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, which is essentially the most revolutionary and critical theory, is carrying out great transformative activities. It has never feared and will never fear any difficulties on the road to the great goal, it always bravely and frankly faces the truth. It serves the interests of the people, openly and uncompromisingly exposes and criticizes shortcomings and errors, and together with the masses, for the victory of our common cause, determines the ways to eliminate shortcomings and correct errors.

The Communist Party and its Central Committee have set an example in their entire activities of how to expose and eliminate shortcomings. For example, everyone still remembers some of the Party's resolutions: the resolution on agricultural issues, the resolution on reorganizing the management of industry and construction, the resolution on giving more power to local authorities and encouraging their initiative in work, the resolution on streamlining state organs, Party organs, and improving leadership style and methods. Criticizing the personality cult and waging a persistent struggle to eliminate its consequences, is this not a proof of the Party's high Leninist principles, decisiveness, and determination? The resolutions of the 20th Party Congress and various plenums of the Central Committee are full of the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, full of the spirit of irreconcilability towards shortcomings and errors. Great Lenin taught us that principled policy is the only correct policy. The Party demands that every communist, every worker in Party and state organs, have a high sense of responsibility for the work they undertake, and the Party will also severely punish all those who deviate from the Party's political line in practical work and forget the interests of the Party and the people. No matter what position a worker holds and what merits he has in the past, he cannot avoid criticism and escape the responsibility to the Party and the people.

The whole question is about the stance and purpose from which criticism is conducted. We expose and criticize shortcomings and errors to eliminate these obstacles on our path, to further consolidate our Soviet system and the positions of the Communist Party, to ensure new victories and faster progress. But how do some writers criticize shortcomings? They do not understand life, do not have the necessary political experience, do not know how to see the main and decisive aspects of life, they seize on some shortcomings and errors of individual workers, do not analyze and think, and mix everything together, frightening themselves and trying to frighten others.

For example, the writer Dugin fell into such an undignified situation. In his work "Not Just for Bread," which is currently being used by reactionary forces abroad to attack us, he biasedly cited some negative facts and gave a distorted narrative from a hostile stance. There are also some correct and powerful parts in Dugin's book, but the overall direction of this book is fundamentally incorrect. Readers feel that the author of this book does not care about eliminating the shortcomings he found in our life, he deliberately exaggerates the shortcomings, and takes a malicious pleasure in them. To depict reality in literary and artistic works with such an attitude is nothing but to distort reality and invert black and white.

It is regrettable that some literary and artistic magazines and publishing houses did not notice this unhealthy and harmful tendency and did not timely evaluate and counter it correctly. The editorial board of the "New World" magazine even provided space to publish works like Dugin's book. The editorial boards of some literary and artistic magazines and the leadership of some publishing houses did not handle their work well and lost their principled stance in many instances. These comrades began to forget that newspapers are our main ideological weapons. The mission of newspapers is to strike at the enemies of the working class and the working people. An army without weapons cannot fight; the Party without such a sharp combat weapon as newspapers cannot effectively carry out ideological work. We cannot entrust newspapers to unreliable people; they should be in the hands of the most loyal, most reliable, politically firm, and faithful to our cause workers.

Because of forgetting this, some organs of the Writers' Union did not consistently adhere to the principled line in literature but were seriously influenced by some people with incorrect stances, essentially becoming disseminators of unhealthy sentiments and tendencies. This situation is particularly evident in the "Moscow Literature" collection. This collection has published some works and articles with ideological flaws, which have been sharply criticized by our public, especially by writers. At the plenary meeting of the Board of the Writers' Union, many writers spoke justly about this. However, the members of the editorial board of this collection did not respect this criticism of their errors, did not respect the opinions of their writing comrades, and avoided expressing a frank and honest attitude towards their stance. It is particularly necessary to mention Comrade Aliger, who still holds the view that the line of the "Moscow Literature" collection is correct and defends the works published in this collection that smuggle in thoughts incompatible with us.

Writers and artists often talk about Party spirit and people's spirit, about creative freedom and Party leadership. These are issues that deserve serious attention. These issues are worth discussing, especially because many confusing fallacies have been spoken and written about them, causing confusion in people's minds and hindering the correct understanding of the Party's policy in literary and artistic issues and the Leninist principles of the Party's leadership in this most important field of ideological work.

Here are some opinions on the Party spirit and people's spirit in literature and art. First, Party spirit and people's spirit should not be understood in opposition. The strength of Soviet socialist society lies in the unity of the Communist Party and the people. The policy of the Communist Party, which represents the fundamental interests of the people, constitutes the most important foundation of the Soviet socialist system and the state system. Therefore, it is a big mistake to think that in our Soviet conditions, one can serve the people without actively participating in the implementation of the Communist Party's policy. Without accepting the Party's views and political line, one cannot march forward together with the people. Whoever wants to be with the people must always be with the Party. Whoever stands firmly on the Party's stance will always be with the people.

The Party spirit in artistic creation does not lie in whether the artist formally has Party membership, but in the artist's beliefs and ideological stance. We have many excellent writers who are not Party members, but their works are deeply Party-spirited in terms of ideological content and political direction and have the right to be considered by the people as works expressing their interests.

If an artist's life goal is to struggle for the communist ideal and the happiness of his homeland, if he is extremely concerned about the interests, thoughts, and wishes of the people, then no matter what subject he chooses, no matter what life phenomena he reflects, his works will be in the interests of the people, the Party, and the state.

Such an artist will freely, unforcedly, and according to his beliefs and mission, according to the dictates of his heart, choose the path of serving the people. In the conditions of a socialist society, the people are the true masters of their own destiny and the creators of the new life, a faithful artist serving the people has no problem of creative freedom. For such an artist, the attitude towards real phenomena is clear, he does not need to compromise, he does not need to force himself, to describe life truthfully from the communist Party stance is the artist's inner demand, he stands firmly on this stance, and in his creation, he protects and defends this stance.

Literary and artistic works, when truly depicting the life of society and the people, should show the positive, bright, and vivid aspects of socialist reality—the foundation of socialist reality—as well as reflect the criticism of shortcomings and the exposure and condemnation of negative phenomena that hinder our forward march.

In life, in reality, in addition to positive things, there are always negative things, weeds often grow with flowers. The reflection of reality completely depends on the author. If he stands on the Party's stance, serves the people, sincerely wants to help the people build a new society, and clear the way for the struggle to build communism, then such a writer, artist, sculptor, and composer can find very excellent examples in the life of workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, in the life of individuals, in the life of all the people in enterprises, collective farms, and state farms, and can fight against negative things, support positive things, and vividly and truly present these positive things in bright colors. If the author does not like the achievements of his homeland, he will only search for bad and negative things, dig in the garbage pit, and pass these things off as characteristic of life.

We have always and will always resolutely and irreconcilably oppose the one-sided, unjust, and untrue depiction of our reality in literature and art. We also oppose those who only search for negative facts in life and take malicious pleasure in them, trying to slander and defame our Soviet system. We also oppose those who depict some sweet pictures to insult the feelings of our people, because our people will never accept and tolerate any hypocrisy. Soviet people oppose novels like Dugin's "Not Just for Bread," which are essentially slanderous, and at the same time, also oppose films like "Unforgettable 1919" or "Happy Life," which are flattering and hypocritical.

Unfortunately, among literary and artistic workers, we will encounter such "defenders of creative freedom" who hope that we will not interfere with, comment on, or give principled evaluations of works that distort Soviet social life, and will not criticize. Originally, these people are opposed to the Party and the state's leadership of literary and artistic work. Sometimes they openly oppose this leadership, and more often they use arguments about excessive guardianship, suppression of creativity, etc., to cover up their sentiments and desires.

We frankly say that this view is contrary to the Leninist principles of the Party and the state's attitude towards literary and artistic issues. Everyone knows that Lenin, considering all the characteristics of literature and art, repeatedly pointed out that the Party cannot abandon the leadership of this important part of social spiritual life, and as the leader of the Party and the head of the Soviet government, he consistently adhered to this principle in his practical activities. Lenin pointed out that it is impossible to be free in society while being separated from society. At the same time, he emphasized that socialist society's free literature will maintain open contact with the working class, it will be inspired by the interests of the working people and socialist ideas.

Lenin was irreconcilable towards those who abandoned the principled line in literary and artistic issues and took a liberal attitude towards ideological errors.

The entire history of the development of Soviet society most convincingly proves that the leadership of the Party and the state, their attention to artistic creation, and their care for writers, artists, sculptors, and composers have ensured outstanding achievements in literature and art and ensured the prosperity of socialist culture among the peoples of the Soviet Union. In the Party's resolutions on ideological issues, the most important tasks and basic policy principles in the field of literature and art have been determined, and these principles remain valid to this day. One of the most important principles is that Soviet literature and art have an inseparable connection with the policy of the Communist Party, which is the most important foundation of the Soviet system. Artists and composers who spoke at the recently held congress said that these resolutions have great positive significance.

Of course, it cannot be denied that some errors occurred in the later years of Stalin, during the period of personality cult. For example, I had to expend a lot of effort to prevent a very meritorious writer like Maxim Rylsky from being severely criticized for his poetry collection "Mother," which is full of deep patriotic feelings. The main reason for these groundless accusations and attacks on Rylsky was that his poetry collection, which praised Soviet Ukraine, did not mention Stalin's name. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich, who was flattering and eager to promote the personality cult of Stalin, labeled Maxim Rylsky as a Ukrainian bourgeois nationalist. Comrade Kaganovich exploited Stalin's weaknesses and did not consider the serious consequences that these groundless accusations against the respected Ukrainian patriot writer Rylsky would bring to Ukrainian literature, and not only to Ukrainian literature.

It goes without saying that we oppose such an attitude towards evaluating literary works.

The Party resolutely condemned and is thoroughly correcting the errors made in various aspects of life, including ideological work, during the period of personality cult. However, the Party also resolutely opposes those who try to use these past flaws to oppose the Party and the state's leadership of literature and art. Only those who disagree with the Party's policy in this regard will take such a stance to oppose the leadership of literature and art. It is painful that among such people, there are also some Party member writers. Some of these comrades do not want to act according to the requirements of Party discipline as stipulated in the Party Constitution, they have subjective interpretations of Party discipline and the duties of Party members, they talk about "creatively" treating Party leadership to cover up their anti-Party behavior. The erroneous stance of these isolated individuals who have deviated from the collective and do not act in unison has been justly condemned at the plenary meeting of the Board of the Writers' Union, at the Moscow Writers' Conference, and at all writers' organizations in the union republics, autonomous republics, territories, and regions. I am very pleased to support Comrade Sobolev, a non-Party writer, who spoke here, because in the struggle against unhealthy sentiments and tendencies, he took a firm, principled, and irreconcilable stance. I do not want to hide that for me, a secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the stance of the non-Party writer Comrade Sobolev on the issue of Party spirit in literature is much closer than the stance of the Party member writer Comrade Aliger, because Comrade Aliger's stance is incorrect and she incorrectly treats the criticism of her errors.

Some people with liberal sentiments may blame me for calling for struggle. Yes, we have never hidden, we have called and will call for principled ideological struggle. In the modern world, the system of socialist ideas and the system of bourgeois ideas are waging a fierce struggle, and in this struggle, there is no middle ground.

Literature and art are developing under the conditions of struggling to establish our communist system of ideas and fighting against the influence of bourgeois culture that is incompatible with us, against outdated concepts and views.

If we stand idly by, adopt a passive and indifferent attitude towards the attempts to smuggle bourgeois views incompatible with Soviet people into our literature and art, then we are not Marxist-Leninists. We must clearly see things, clearly understand that the enemy exists, the enemy is trying to use the ideological front to weaken the strength of socialism. In this case, our ideological weapons should be well-prepared and used at any time. The Hungarian incident reminded us that the counter-revolution used some writers for its vile purposes, and this lesson reminds us of what consequences will result if we do not politically monitor and take an unprincipled and indecisive attitude towards the conspiracies of all reactionary forces hostile to socialism. Everyone should understand that under the current conditions of fierce struggle between the forces of socialism and imperialist reaction, we must always be vigilant.

In the course of our conversation, the issue of struggling against ideological errors and unhealthy sentiments has been sharply raised. These issues cannot be imagined to have any other formulation. Not to do it thoroughly or not to clarify it will bring serious losses to the cause.

We hope to strengthen and unite all forces in literature and art on the basis of principles, not on the basis of concessions and deviations from Marxist-Leninist principles. For this strengthening, principled criticism and self-criticism are being carried out. This criticism can help those who have made mistakes to recognize and correct their mistakes, stand firmly on their stance, and increase their creative enthusiasm. When carrying out criticism and self-criticism, it is necessary to carefully analyze whether a person's mistake is accidental or reflects a series of his views and his definite line of conduct, and to consider his attitude towards criticism. Everyone can make mistakes, it is necessary not only to see what a person did yesterday but also to see what he can do tomorrow, this is the main thing, we should help such a person to recognize shortcomings, quickly eliminate shortcomings and correct mistakes.

For example, everyone knows that public opinion has also criticized some shortcomings in the work of our famous poet Tvardovsky, who is recognized as having contributed to the development of Soviet literature. A friendly conversation with Comrade Tvardovsky gives reason to hope that this master of language will draw the necessary conclusions and please the readers with his new excellent works. Public opinion has also severely criticized the shortcomings of such a great writer as Panfilov. We believe this is correct. Comrade Panfilov himself now admits that criticism has been beneficial to him.

The purpose of principled criticism is to help literary and artistic workers in their creative work, so that they can more effectively serve the people of our country, actively participate in the people's struggle for communism, and enrich Soviet socialist culture with their works.

Our Soviet system and the Communist Party have not once saved those who were even considered hopeless and incurable, making them actively participate in the work. In the literary and artistic world, there are not a few such examples: creative workers have created masterpieces after criticism. If we talk about Comrade Dugin, I believe that with our help and his subjective efforts, he can return to the correct path and work fruitfully for the people's interests, for the interests of the socialist motherland, together with all the writers.

Various creative associations should play a very important role in the development of literature and art, in the ideological education and creative life of each writer; these associations should truly become a closely united, active fighting collective on the basis of principles. It is necessary to make the creative associations have true friendship, so that each writer, artist, sculptor, film worker, musician, or theater worker can always receive comradely care for his creative development there. The collective should timely support any good work, support the appearance of beneficial initiatives in creative work. It is also very important to timely point out the shortcomings and errors of individual creative workers, prevent them from deviating from the principled stance, and provide help and support to those who need help and support.

Writers and artists are active fighters for communism. Their excellent works educate millions of people. This makes our creative associations and their Party organizations responsible for constant and great ideological education work, arming our creative workers with Marxist-Leninist theoretical knowledge and a correct understanding of the Communist Party's policy. We should make all our creative workers clearly understand their great role and high sense of responsibility in the all-people's struggle for communism.

Our creative organizations are doing great work to implement the tasks proposed by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the fields of literature and art. The recent plenary meetings of various writers' unions, the congress of artists, and the congress of composers have increased the enthusiasm of creative forces and enhanced their unity. It is very gratifying that in our Ukrainian and Belarusian republics, in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Baltic republics, the activities of writers' unions have become active.

However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of many creative organizations. It should be pointed out that recently, shortcomings have been found in the work of the Moscow branch of the Soviet Writers' Union, which has a large team of writers. At the Moscow Writers' Conference, there were speeches that violated the Party's policy in the field of literature and art. Unfortunately, these speeches were often not given the proper rebuke, and the work of the Party organization of Moscow writers often did not reach the required level. Everyone knows that the writers' unions of Ukraine, Belarus, and several other union republics pay attention to the situation of the Moscow branch of the Writers' Union and have correctly criticized many ideologically unhealthy literary works and articles published in the "Moscow Literature" collection.

Such serious shortcomings in the work of the Moscow branch of the Writers' Union cannot be tolerated, because it should set an example for the creative associations of other cities. We hope that the writers, with the help of the Party organization, will analyze the causes of these shortcomings themselves and take measures to correct this situation.

The issue of establishing the Writers' Union of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is raised here. I believe that this proposal should be supported, and the Writers' Union of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic should be established. It is not normal that the writers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic do not have their own union, while the other union republics have writers' unions. Of course, the Moscow branch of the Writers' Union cannot represent all the writers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. At the same time, it should be noted that the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is a voluntary union of multiple nationalities. In addition to the territories and regions, there are also fourteen autonomous republics, seven autonomous regions, and ten national districts in the federation.

The establishment of the Writers' Union of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic will be one of the major measures taken by the Central Committee and the Soviet government to further expand the powers of the union republics and play the role of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In addition to the creative ideological issues that should be the focus of the Writers' Union of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, serious consideration should also be given to measures that help the development of local writing forces. It is necessary to care about creating the necessary conditions for the constant creative work of writers in autonomous republics, territories, and regions, for example, it is necessary to adjust the manuscript fees and the allocation of paper for publishing literary works in local publishing houses.

Our meetings and discussions have been fruitful. In these meetings, we have frankly exchanged views on some very important issues in the lives and work of literary and artistic workers.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the Soviet Union are successfully implementing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the plans for the construction of communism. This year, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. Our people will welcome this historically significant day with outstanding victories in economic and cultural construction and in improving the well-being of the people. How great the achievements in the social and political life of the people are! The historically significant resolutions of the 20th Party Congress have been enthusiastically supported by the people of our country, and it has stirred up an unprecedented upsurge in political, labor, and creative enthusiasm among the broadest masses, and created conditions for further developing the talents of the people. In the magnificent creative construction work, the communist consciousness of the working people is constantly improving, and the excellent qualities and excellent character and spiritual appearance of the Soviet people, the builders of the new era, the builders of communism, are increasingly fully manifested.

The mighty waves of the October Revolution are irresistibly rolling forward, sweeping away all obstacles and obstacles on the road to communist society.

Historical experience proves that we are not advancing towards communism along an already paved smooth road. Those who are at the forefront of the communist builders are required to: clearly see the great goal and the prospect of advancing towards this goal, deeply understand the laws of social development, have abundant energy and indomitable will, not fear difficulties and spare no effort to pave the way, guide millions of new society builders forward.

The 40-year experience of socialist construction in our country proves that the Soviet people, closely united around their tested leader, the Communist Party, armed with the invincible revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism, will surely be able to gloriously complete all the great historical tasks before them. There is no doubt that the writers, poets, artists, sculptors, and composers of the Soviet Union will continue to be worthy sons of their socialist motherland and will contribute all their strength and talents to sing the heroic deeds of our great people, the builders of communist society.

专栏：

　　文学艺术要同人民生活保持密切的联系
　　尼·赫鲁晓夫
    编者按：苏共中央第一书记尼·赫鲁晓夫同志曾先后在苏共中央今年5月13日举行的作家会议和5月19日的作家、艺术家、雕刻家、作曲家招待会以及7月召开的党的积极分子会议上，谈到文学艺术问题。苏联“共产党人”杂志第十二期以“文学艺术要同人民生活保持密切的联系”为题，发表了赫鲁晓夫同志这几次讲话的摘要，苏联“真理报”在8月28日转载了这篇文章。本报现译载于下：
    共产党遵循着列宁关于文学艺术是争取共产主义的全民斗争的组成部分这一指示，过去和现在都认为作家、美术家、雕刻家、作曲家和全体苏联文化工作者的活动具有头等的意义，认为我们多民族的苏维埃社会主义文化的繁荣具有头等的意义。
    苏联文学艺术之所以有力量，是因为它同人民的生活联系着，同人民为共产主义事业而进行的斗争联系着。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会指出，我们的文学艺术工作者是共产党在实现建设新社会的伟大任务、对劳动人民进行共产主义教育方面的忠实助手。
    在研究文学艺术发展问题的时候，不能脱离当前共产党和苏联人民在进一步提高我国的经济和文化、为建设共产主义社会而斗争方面所要解决的迫切任务。
　　一
    大家知道，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在发展工业、农业、文化建设和提高人民生活水平方面提出了一些重大的任务。代表大会闭幕虽然不久，但是在这段时期内在实现代表大会确定的方针方面所取得的成绩的确是巨大的。我国工业正在顺利地执行第六个五年计划的任务。许多资产阶级政治家坦白地说，苏联工业增长的速度使他们恐惧，苏联的榜样对全世界劳动人民所发生的巨大影响使他们惊惶。我和你们都清楚地知道，我们的榜样是怎样令人信服地影响着世界各国劳动人民的思想。
    不久前，苏联最高苏维埃举行会议，讨论改组管理工业和建设的问题。会议指出，在苏维埃政权的年代里，我国工业品的产量提高了二十九倍，机器制造和金属加工业生产增加了一百七十九倍，电力生产几乎提高了九十九倍。
    这些材料雄辩地证明，我国由于沿着列宁指出的道路前进，已经变成了一个强大的社会主义国家。目前正在实行的改组管理工业和建设的措施，对于进一步发展苏联的经济具有巨大的意义。
    把管理工业的重心转移到地方上，就可能更具体、更有效地领导经济，进一步发挥群众的主动性，提高地方机关的作用和责任感。今天，企业和建筑工地的工作问题已经不在各部和总管理局来解决，而直接在经济地区就地解决。
    我想，在这个问题上，也许不是所有的人都同意我的意见。一部分人公开地谈到这一点，另外一部分人可能缄默不言。这是他们的事情。应当记得，当共产党和我们政府决定开荒的时候，也不是所有的人都理解这件事情的意义。在改组工业管理这个问题上也是如此。有人反对这件事情。这是守旧的表现。旧的很方便，人们已经习惯了，然而过时的、旧的东西应当加以粉碎。我们不能按照旧的方式生活，我们必需前进。
    如果说，苏联人民在开垦荒地方面取得了很大的成绩，那么，共产党目前实行的改善我国工业工作的措施一定会取得更大的成就。我们实行的经济管理的改组，将给苏联人民带来的不仅仅是物质福利，它还将引起文化的新的繁荣，因为文化力量将更平均地加以分配，经济地区的中心也将更快地成长为文化中心。
    关于改组管理工业和建设的报告提纲发表以后，某些作家表现得不理解在我们生活中发生的新的过程，没有充分的准备来正确地估价在迫切需要改进工业管理形式的现阶段中整个国民经济的情况。在这方面这些作家还表现出脱离生活。但是，我相信，生活很快就会告诉这些同志，他们错了。
    最近几年，党十分注意发展我们的农业。你们知道，几年以前我们农业是处在怎样困难的情况中。你们大概记得，当1953年中央委员会九月全会公开而且直率地谈到领导农业方面的缺点的时候，资本主义国家中的我们的敌人发出了怎样的叫嚣和喧嚷。敌人高喊，这是集体农庄的崩溃，是我们全部事业的崩溃。
    这几年来，党和全体苏联人民在发展农业方面进行了巨大的工作。现在，每一个苏联人都尝到了这个工作的果实。为什么我们的农业在长时期内严重地落后呢？其所以如此，是因为在中央没有谁想真正地了解一下地方的真实情况。大家知道，斯大林哪里也不去，既没有征求过农业工作者的意见，也没有倾听过地方工作者的呼声，而受斯大林委托来监督农业的中央的人们却向斯大林隐瞒了巨大的缺点，他们只是敷衍蒙混。集体农庄庄员、全体农业工作者在提高农产品生产方面的物质利益的原则，遭到了严重的破坏。
    让我来举几个例子。战争结束不久，我回我的家乡看望我的叔伯姐妹。她有个园子。我对她说：
    “你有几棵很好的苹果树。”
    她回答说：
    “秋天我要把它们都砍掉。”
    我问：“为什么？”
    她说：“税额太高，种园子划不来。”
    我把这次谈话向斯大林讲了，告诉他，集体农庄庄员砍园子。而他后来对我说，我是一个民粹主义者，我有民粹主义的观点，我丧失了无产阶级的阶级嗅觉。
    另外一个例子。我们从城市里派了成千上万的人到集体农庄去收获马铃薯，而集体农庄庄员自己却不动手收获。是不是有过这样的情况呢？是的，有过的。为什么集体农庄庄员不愿意收获马铃薯呢？因为在采购马铃薯的时候我们付的价钱非常低。集体农庄向采购站运送马铃薯的费用比他们卖马铃薯所得的代价还高。
    我们不得不改变这种状况，定出一个恰当的价格标准从物质上鼓励集体农民关心农产品的生产。在这件事情上不从物质上鼓励集体农民，那就不会有多大的进展。当谈到像粮食、肉类、油类和马铃薯这样一些人民切身需要的产品的时候，不能忘记这一点。但是，遗憾得很，我们这里有时候还遇到一些“老顽固”，他们不能理解这个道理。脱离生活和对人民利益漠不关心的人不能理解：墨守成规会把事情搞坏，会给人民利益带来不可弥补的损失。思想战线的工作人员中间也有这种人。他们是陈腐的观念的俘虏，是书本上的公式、教条和定理的俘虏。
    应当承认，书本上的烦琐哲学的观念是相当顽强的。在我们的工作中还常常感到有这些东西。抱有这些观点的人害怕一切新鲜事物，他们大声叫喊和喧嚷，他们惊惶失措，失去了冷静分析情况的能力，没有能力理解必须实现社会发展过程所要求采取的措施。当中央建议在农业方面实行新的计划制度的时候，保守的人就出来反对这种措施。他们企图吓唬中央，扬言说，假如我们不从中央拟定播种农作物的计划，那末集体农民就会停止播种小麦，而我们就无从得到粮食了。这些保守的人受到了实际生活的嘲笑。千千万万的集体农民热烈地支持新的计划制度，积极地投入这项工作，结果我们得到了很大的好处。
    党的第二十次代表大会表明，现在我们的国家拥有一切必要的条件在极短的历史时期内解决苏联的基本经济任务——在按人口计算的生产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。列宁在十月革命前夕就认为解决这项任务是社会主义国家最重要的任务之一，这项任务解决之后，就能够更加增强苏联的经济实力，大大提高人民的生活水平。
    我国的工人和农民跟着布尔什维克党，跟着列宁在1917年10月进行了推翻地主资本家制度的斗争，就是为了要获得自由和建设新的美好的生活。这种美好的生活表现在什么地方呢？它表现在：人们成了自由的公民，成了自己命运的主人，他们不是为剥削者而是为自己工作，他们有足够的必要条件来过有文化的富裕的生活。共产党把经常关怀不断提高劳动人民的福利作为自己的首要职责。现在我们的任务是：在最近几年内使全国拥有丰裕的粮食、肉类、油类、牛奶这类生活必需品以及其他消费品。你们知道，党目前正在作多么大的努力来尽量扩大城市和乡村的住宅建筑，以便保证我国的劳动人民有设备完善的住宅。
    由于最近几年所实行的一些措施，我们的农业现在已经达到这样的发展水平：它在最近几年内就能顺利地解决在肉类、乳类和油类生产方面按人口计算赶上美国的任务。目前我国和美国的肉类、油类和乳类的生产情况怎样呢？1956年按人口计算苏联每人得到32.3公斤肉，美国是102.3公斤；我们每人得到奶油2.8公斤，美国是3.8公斤；我们每人得到牛奶245公斤，美国是343公斤。由此可见，我们在油类、奶类、特别是肉类按人口计算方面目前还大大落后于美国。我列举的数字表明，我们面临着多么艰巨的任务。我们能不能解决这项任务呢？怀疑主义者吓唬我们说，我们好像扛着一付力不胜任的担子。他们不相信社会主义经济的潜力，不了解我们的国家，不懂得我们人民的心灵，不相信我们人民的无穷无尽的力量。
    如果我们害怕在争取提高人民福利的斗争中产生的困难，我们就不成其为共产党员，就不成其为列宁的学生和继承者了。我们清楚地了解我们面临的任务是艰巨的，但是共产党和苏联人民一定能完成这项任务。我们坚定的信心的基础是：我们准确地估计了社会主义农业拥有的实在的潜力，考虑到先进集体农庄的经验。
    党提出的任务获得了全体人民的赞同和拥护。劳动人民的创造性在全国蓬勃地发展着。集体农庄庄员保证要把肉类、油类和奶类的产量提高三倍、五倍、十倍和更多些——这是他们给缺乏信心的人和怀疑主义者的回答。
    现在，集体农庄的畜牧业正在大发展之中。在这种情况下，党中央委员会讨论了从1958年起取消集体农民个人经济中农产品的义务交售问题。现在我们有充分的可能来这样做。实现这个措施对于千百万劳动人民是具有重大的切身利益的。
    我还想谈谈党为了进一步改善苏联人民生活条件而采取的其他措施。我国工业的迅速发展，劳动生产率的不断提高，为了使生产机械化而对科学技术最新成就的广泛采用，这一切使我们有可能在最近改为七小时工作日，而在采煤采矿工业的地下工作部分改为六小时工作日。在资本主义国家中生产机械化和自动化的结果是：劳动人民的生活条件恶化，工人阶级中大批失业。我们社会主义国家的情况就完全两样了。生产技术越完善，社会劳动生产率就提高得越快，劳动人民生活水平也提高得越快。在实行七小时工作日之后，我们还要过渡到六小时工作日，这一前景已经为时不远了。这样一来，就有更有利的条件来全面发展精神文化，全面发展社会主义社会公民的个性。物质文化的发展是精神文化发展的基础。物质文化水平低下，整个社会的精神文化就不能繁荣。这两者是互相联系的。
    苏联是多民族的社会主义国家，十五个平等的兄弟加盟共和国在自愿的基础上组成这个国家。从前受压迫的民族在社会主义发展的道路上获得了国家的独立之后，就有了无限的可能性发展经济和文化，在短短的时期内就有了飞跃的进展。应该坦率地说，我们的确还没有鲜明地反映出我们各共和国人民的生活中在苏维埃政权建立以来发生的那些伟大的、具有历史意义的变革。在这方面我们的文学艺术工作者欠了人民很大一笔债。我建议文学家和艺术家们进一步集中精力了解我国各民族的生活，深入到他们的生活中去。那时候他们就会看到成千上万的生动事例，看到人们的命运起了多大的变化，看到我国人民在伟大十月社会主义革命的四十周年获得了何等出色的成就。
    最近几年，我到过哈萨克、乌兹别克和塔吉克好几次，我也到过吉尔吉斯，到过波罗的海沿岸的共和国——立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚。也到过格鲁吉亚，不过这是很久以前的事了。我们每一个加盟共和国在经济建设和文化建设方面都取得了巨大的成就，许多熟练的干部成长起来了。
    我们各苏维埃共和国的经济和文化是多么繁荣灿烂啊！在苏维埃社会里，在共产党领导下，在为共产主义事业而进行的具有历史意义的斗争的进程中，涌现出了多么出色的人材啊！当你碰到这些人，同他们一交谈，你就会有这样一种难过和惋惜的感觉：在文学艺术作品里，我们的作家和艺术家实在是很少成功地、无愧地体现出这些人的形象，很少揭示出这是在社会主义时代产生和教育出来的新人。这些新人是争取人类的自由和幸福的战士，他们体现了崇高的精神品质和共产主义道德的特征。加强同人民的日常生活的联系，加强同人民的劳动活动的联系，有助于作家和艺术家改变对我国人民的旧的看法，有助于他们了解人民的心灵，了解他们的性格、他们的思想和愿望，在小说、诗歌、戏剧、电影、绘画和音乐中创造出我们现代人的真实而又光辉的形象。
    第二十次党代表大会在其决议中指出，为了经济和文化的进一步高涨和繁荣，必须尽力扩大加盟共和国的权力和提高它们的作用，彻底实现列宁的民族政策。代表大会之后，党和政府在这方面已经做了许多工作，这些工作的结果已经对各共和国的生活起了良好的影响。
    这里我想着重谈谈苏共中央和苏联政府为扩大俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国的权力而实行的一些最重要的措施。俄罗斯联邦有资格受到苏联各兄弟民族的应有尊重。苏联的走上了社会主义道路的各族人民同俄罗斯人一起怀着热爱在说：俄罗斯母亲。大家知道，早在革命以前的时期，俄罗斯民主知识分子的杰出代表人物就同俄国各民族的先进知识分子代表人物有密切的联系，积极地起来反对民族压迫，对各民族的文化发展起了有益的影响。
    英勇的俄罗斯工人阶级在布尔什维克党的领导下引导各民族的劳动人民反对势不两立的沙皇政权，反对资产阶级地主制度，保证了社会主义革命的胜利。在我国伟大社会主义改造的进程中，俄罗斯人民做了许许多多的工作来帮助国内从前受压迫的民族克服长久以来经济和文化上的落后状态，把它们提高到同自己一样的水平。无论是在和平建设时期或是在战争考验时期，俄罗斯人民做出的伟大而崇高的事业使他们受到我国其他各族人民的热烈的感激和尊敬。这丝毫没有缩小各族人民在苏联社会主义兄弟大家庭中的杰出作用。我们苏联各族人民对共产主义建设事业都有他们的伟大贡献。苏维埃制度的不可战胜的力量就在于我们多民族的苏维埃国家各族人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊。
    同志们，应该承认，直到不久以前，俄罗斯联邦还没有获得适应它在国家中的作用和地位的应有的充分权力。苏共第二十次代表大会之后，这种不正常的状态被纠正了。成立了苏共中央俄罗斯联邦局。苏共中央的这一执行机关处理俄罗斯联邦的一切事务，代表苏共中央领导俄罗斯联邦的党务、经济、文化各部门的工作。俄罗斯联邦部长会议已具有一切必要的权力来领导工业、农业和文化建设。不久以前实行了改组工业和建设的管理工作，在俄罗斯联邦按经济行政区建立了七十个国民经济委员会，这就可以更具体地领导共和国的经济发展。
    扩大各加盟共和国权力的措施，具有很大的意义，为各加盟共和国的全面发展提供了更为广泛的可能性。
    同志们！我们的力量就在于我们党的队伍的团结，在于苏联各族人民的牢不可破的团结，在于他们团结在苏联共产党中央委员会周围。只要我们队伍有这种坚如磐石的、牢不可破的团结，世界反动势力的任何阴谋诡计都是不足惧的。二
    有些信奉“纯理论”的人企图把我们党的活动，把我们党所采取的措施说成是什么狭隘的实践主义。在作家中间也有些人拥护这种观点。对于这种错误不能置之不理。让我们分析一下，应该如何从马克思主义观点来理解理论同实践的联系。每一个马克思列宁主义者都没有贬低革命理论的意义的想法。列宁曾经说过，没有革命的理论，就没有革命的实践。
    马克思列宁主义的理论是工人阶级根本利益的表现，是劳动人民根本利益的表现。它不是教条，而是实际革命运动的指南。在历史发展的每个新阶段上，实际生活都要提出从社会要求而来的任务。创造性地对待理论，善于发展和推进马克思列宁主义科学，这就在于：在科学地总结实际经验的基础上正确地理解社会发展过程中已经成熟了的新任务，指出具体实现这些任务的途径。
    苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，是创造性地发展马克思列宁主义理论的典范。代表大会所规定的我们党的政治方针，表现了苏联人民在为共产主义而奋斗的现阶段上的根本利益。人民的这种根本利益就是：要保证进一步大力发展社会主义工业、首先是重工业，迅速提高农业，并在这一基础上尽力提高劳动人民的物质福利。
    共产党近年来在党和国家建设方面以及在发展经济和提高人民生活水平方面所采取的措施证明，我们党的全部活动是以理论和实践的不可分割的结合为基础的。在斯大林晚年的时候，这种理论和实践的联系遭到了破坏。这是脱离生活的人所不理解的，这些人自命为献身于马克思列宁主义科学的阐述者，而实际上同列宁主义断绝了关系，走上了进行宗派分裂活动的道路，反对党的根本利益、人民的根本利益。中央六月全会揭露了并且在思想上粉碎了反对第二十次党代表大会制定的列宁主义方针的马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫和参加他们一伙的谢皮洛夫的反党集团。我们全党、全体苏联人民都一致拥护苏共中央六月全会的这项决议，因为它的目的是要进一步加强党的列宁主义的团结。
    我知道有一些人以理论家的面貌出现，而实质上他们的全部理论“智慧”不外是动不动就摘引马克思列宁主义经典著作家的词句。这种可怜的学者自封为理论家，却不懂得这样一个重要的马克思主义真理，即人们在从事政治、科学和艺术活动之前，首先要吃饭，要喝水，要住房子，要穿衣服。这些书呆子和学究们忘记了，人民夺取政权正是为了更快地发展生产力，扩大社会财富，提高自己的福利和创造更好的生活条件。
    假如现在马克思、恩格斯、列宁能够复活的话，他们一定要嘲笑那些咬文嚼字和引经据典的书呆子，因为这些人不去研究现代社会生活，创造性地发展理论，而只想在经典著作家的著作中寻找如何对待某个地区机器拖拉机站的词句。例如，想从马克思或恩格斯的著作中寻找能告诉我们如何处理集体农民交售自己的农产品的问题的词句，这是可笑的。
    应该承认，在我们的经济学家和哲学家中间有一些人脱离了生活，脱离了共产主义建设实践。甚至可以遇到这样一些经济学家，他们在谈到现代条件下的工资的时候，竟利用大约一百年前马克思在他的名著“资本论”中举过的一些例子。当然，这种人并不多，但遗憾的是，有时候仍然可以遇到。这样的经济学家不可能从生活中举出具体的例子，因为他们的确不了解生活。这些人不是理论家，而是学舌的鹦鹉，只会老是死记某些词句，不断加以重复。这种“理论”著作是分文不值的。
    我们共产党人是积极的革命活动家，我们认为改造世界、建设共产主义社会是自己的任务。我们的理论的力量就在于：它密切联系生活，综合千百万人的创造经验，保护占世界人口大多数的劳动人民的根本利益。马克思列宁主义理论的力量就在于：它是根本革命的，它决不容忍停滞不前、墨守成规和毫无生气，它照耀着通向共产主义未来的道路，引导各族人民前进，帮助他们克服达到这一目的的道路上的困难和障碍。
    马克思列宁主义者是新生活的创造者，是具有伟大革命思想的人，是敢于想像、充满鼓舞人心的理想的人。同时，他们又是两脚稳稳地站在现实土壤上的人世间的人，他们是一些头脑清醒的政治家，在自己的活动中考虑一切现实的条件和可能，不怕困难，不隐瞒矛盾，敢于坦白而且忠诚地把全部真相告诉自己的人民，尽管这种真相有时候是令人痛苦的。列宁的学生和继承者，共产党员，承担着为人民谋求福利的大无畏的任务，他们不遗余力地实现这些任务。
    同志们，我们回想一下，列宁是如何重视我们党在经济发展方面的实际活动的。他说过，如果我们能够生产十万台拖拉机，那么农民就会说他们赞成公社，也就是赞成共产主义。在俄国电气化计划制定以后，列宁把这个计划称为我们党的第二个纲领。
    第二十次代表大会制定的伟大的共产主义建设计划，是我们在国家发展现阶段中行动的战斗纲领。这些计划规定，生产力将在技术不断进步的基础上大力发展，以求大大增产消费品，向共产主义迈进新的一大步。
    实现第二十次党代表大会制定的计划，具有重大的国际意义。它将是给资本主义世界的思想家的又一个致命的打击，因为这些人广泛利用关于最发达的资本主义国家的按人口计算的商品产量材料这样一个暂时的过渡的因素，来对社会主义实行恶毒的攻击。
    一切正直而没有偏见的人都看到，随着我国国民经济的蓬勃发展，我国同最发达的资本主义国家之间按人口计算的生产量的差额在一年比一年剧烈地缩减着。现在我国的工业产值已达到世界第二位。甚至我们的死敌也无法否认苏联的经济实力和它的经济发展的迅速。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、一切社会主义国家所取得的卓越成就，使得社会主义的敌人惊惶失措。社会主义思想在世界各国的吸引力之所以越来越大，就是由于社会主义国家的这些成就，而社会主义的敌人却硬说社会主义思想甚至于具有超自然的性质。正因为如此，所以他们往往把在我们的足迹从来没有到过的那些地方所发生的事件的责任也推到我们身上。我们的思想工作者最重要的任务就是：理解、领会和正确阐明伟大的社会主义改造的实质。
    谈到思想工作者的任务，就不能回避关于个人崇拜和消除它的后果的问题。我们对违反马克思列宁主义精神的对斯大林的个人崇拜的谴责，引起了国内和国外的广泛的反应。苏联人民、各国共产党和工人党、所有我们的外国朋友都热烈赞同和一致支持第二十次党代表大会的决议和苏共中央关于消除个人崇拜后果的著名决定。社会主义的敌人企图利用对个人崇拜的批评来达到他们肮脏的目的，发动恶毒的诬蔑宣传来攻击我国，攻击整个社会主义阵营。他们力图搅乱和平、民主和社会主义战士的队伍，削弱马克思列宁主义思想的影响，动摇社会主义阵营国家的团结，在人民面前诬蔑和诽谤共产党。现在大家都看到，社会主义的敌人的这种卑鄙打算遭到了可耻的失败。
    各国共产党和工人党及时地识破了和揭穿了帝国主义分子的计谋，给了那些策动和组织思想破坏活动的人以及一切企图修正马克思列宁主义基础的机会主义分子以致命的打击。
    在尖锐的思想斗争中，我们苏联的知识分子证明自己是政治上成熟的、坚定的、忠实于马克思列宁主义思想的，他们同全体苏联人民一起，在为共产主义事业而进行的伟大斗争中表现出团结一致。但是应该承认，在知识分子中间有一些人，他们开始站不稳立场，在估计同克服个人崇拜后果有关的一些复杂思想问题上表现了某种动摇。
    文学艺术工作者中间的某些代表人物产生这种动摇的原因何在呢？照我看来，这是因为某些同志片面地和不正确地理解党对斯大林个人崇拜的批评的实质。他们企图把这个批评说成是对斯大林在我们党和国家生活中的积极作用的笼统的否定，他们走上了不正确的道路，怀着成见，只寻找我国人民争取社会主义胜利的斗争史上的阴暗面和错误，而忽略了苏维埃国家在社会主义建设方面的具有全世界历史意义的成就。
    我在同美国“纽约时报”的编辑谈话中，在回答他提出的“斯大林在历史上将占怎样的地位？”这一问题的时候说过，斯大林在苏联历史上将占应有的地位。斯大林有重大的缺点，但他是一个忠诚的马克思列宁主义者、一个忠诚和坚定的革命家。斯大林在他活动的后期犯了许多错误，但是他为我们的国家、我们的党和整个国际工人运动作了许多有益的事情。我们党和苏联人民将记住斯大林，给他应有的评价。
    为了正确地理解党对个人崇拜的批评的实质，必须深刻地认识到，在斯大林同志的活动中我们看到两个方面：一个是肯定的方面，我们支持这一方面，并且给予它崇高的评价；另一个是否定的方面，我们批评、谴责和驳斥这一方面。
    斯大林长期以来在我们党的中央委员会中占有领导地位。他的全部活动同我们国家的伟大社会主义改造的实现密切联系着。在这些年代中，由于实现了列宁的社会主义建设计划，我们国家的面貌起了根本的变化。我们都记得在伟大的十月革命胜利以前俄国是个什么样子。这是一个在经济和文化方面落后的国家，被沙皇制度弄得来降落到半殖民地国家的地位。我们再看一看苏维埃国家的今天是什么样子！苏联是一个实力强大的社会主义大国，它在世界历史的进程中起着决定性的影响，得到全世界劳动人民的深深的尊重。
    我们国家发展中的伟大成就，是在共产党和它的中央委员会的领导下取得的，而斯大林在中央委员会中起过领导的作用。苏联的社会主义建设是在同阶级敌人及其在党内的代理人——托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子和资产阶级民族主义者的尖锐斗争的环境下实现的。这是一场政治斗争。党揭露了他们这些列宁主义的敌人、我国社会主义建设的敌人，这是作得很正确的。在政治上，他们受到谴责，受到公正的谴责。
    在这次斗争中，斯大林进行了有益的工作。这是不能从我国工人阶级、农民和知识分子争取社会主义的斗争史上，从苏维埃国家的历史上抹掉的。因为如此，我们是重视和尊敬斯大林的。我们曾经站在斯大林的灵柩旁边痛哭过，那时候我们对斯大林的敬意是真诚的。我们现在对他在我们党和苏维埃国家历史上的肯定作用的估价也是真诚的。我们每个人都信任过斯大林，这种信任是以这样一种信念为基础的，即是，我们同斯大林一起进行的事业是有利于革命，有利于工人阶级和全体劳动人民的。
    我们党和我们大家坚决谴责斯大林的一些粗暴的错误和歪风，这些错误和歪风给党的事业和人民的事业造成了重大的损失。我们失去了许多正直和忠诚的人、我们党和苏维埃国家的工作人员，这些人受到诽谤，并且无辜地遭受灾难。其中有许多人，我们已经恢复了他们的名誉。党谴责了在个人崇拜时期所形成的不正确的领导方法，坚持不渝地为恢复列宁的党的生活准则和领导原则、为全力扩大苏维埃社会主义民主而努力。
    斯大林在同列宁主义的敌人的斗争中，立场是正确的，然而犯了这些粗暴和严重的错误，这是怎么回事呢？同志们，这是一个复杂的问题。这是斯大林的悲剧，这个悲剧在许多方面是他的个性、他的性格中的重大缺点所造成的，列宁在1922年12月给党代表大会的信中曾经指出过这些缺点。斯大林的这些缺点在他的晚年特别发展起来了，他严重地破坏了列宁的党的生活准则，忽视了集体领导的原则，独断独行地决定党和国家的许多最重要的问题，他同干部和劳动群众的联系削弱了。斯大林的这些个人的缺点被党和人民的死敌、煽动者贝利亚利用来危害我们的事业以后，情况就更加复杂了。
    马林科夫同志在这方面也有很大的过失，他完全受了贝利亚的影响，成了他的影子，成了贝利亚手中的工具。在党内和国家里身居高位的马林科夫同志，不仅没有制止斯大林，反而很圆滑地利用了斯大林晚年的弱点和习惯。在许多场合下，他促使斯大林采取了应受严厉谴责的行动。
    现在，大家都很清楚，党为消除个人崇拜的后果所进行的工作，具有多么巨大的积极意义。
    批评个人崇拜和消除它在思想工作方面的影响，引起了创作工作者、首先是作家们的深刻的感受和严重的思考，这是十分自然的。
    在这方面感受最大和最尖锐的是谁呢？同志们，我认为感受最大的是作家、美术家、雕刻家、作曲家和其他艺术工作者。在作家中间感受特别深的是那些最接近党、接近中央委员会、因而也是接近斯大林的同志。这是对人民的接近，对人民在我们党的领导下所作的一切事情的接近。在这些作家的作品中，真实地诚恳地描述了党和人民的斗争和胜利。在这些作品中，也常常看到斯大林同志的形象。这些作品的作者做了好事，他们希望我们党好，他们同全体人民一起，在党的领导下，为崇高的共产主义理想进行了斗争。当然，在一些场合下，在个人崇拜时期总的情势的影响下，在文学艺术作品中出现了对斯大林个人的不客观的片面的描绘，过份夸大了他的功绩，而党的作用和人民的作用却没有得到应有的反映。
    在党对个人崇拜和斯大林所犯的错误展开了批评的时候，某些作家认为，仿佛他们过去的全部创作活动都是不正确的。某些作家甚至产生了是否要修改他们的一切著作的情绪。应当承认，在知识分子中间也有这样一些人，他们以前并没有积极参加为我们的事业而进行的斗争，现在却开始诬蔑和责难那些歌颂我国人民在党的领导下所获得的成就的文学艺术工作者。他们想出了“粉饰太平的人”这类骂人的字眼并且加以广泛的使用，他们把这个标签贴在每个真实地描写了我们的现实、描写了人民的创造性劳动及其伟大胜利的人的身上，贴在在文学艺术作品中创造了正面的苏维埃人的形象的人的身上。
    有些同志问道，如何对待我们的人所获得的斯大林奖金。我认为，应当以尊重的感情对待奖金，骄傲地佩戴斯大林奖金获得者的荣誉奖章。假如我获得过斯大林奖金，我就会带着这个荣誉奖章。在授予斯大林奖金这项工作中曾经发生过错误，在一些场合下奖金被不够格的人得去了。但这只是个别的现象。除了少数的例外，科学工作者、文学艺术工作者的斯大林奖金都是理应获得的。
    必须十分直率和明确地指出，共产党在过去、现在和将来都支持那些忠心耿耿地为本国人民服务、同人民一道为祖国在共产主义建设中获得的成就而高兴、用鲜明的色彩在文学艺术作品中表现这些成就的作家和艺术工作者。三
    苏联共产党中央委员会认为，就极重大的思想工作问题同文学艺术工作者举行同志式的会晤和座谈是十分有益的，并且应当得到一切的支持。最近时期，在苏联共产党中央委员会所举行的会晤和座谈中，作家和艺术工作者坦率地、毫不拘束地谈了一切使他们关心的问题，我很喜欢这样。他们是在友谊的气氛中谈话的，他们的谈话得到正确的理解。这种交往形式对于同志式的交换意见是极端必要的，这样做的结果对我们生活和工作中的一些迫切问题可以取得互相的谅解和一致的看法。
    党为什么如此重视文学艺术问题呢？这是因为文学艺术在我们党的思想工作中，在对劳动人民的共产主义教育中起着非常重要的作用。作家、美术家、雕刻家、作曲家、电影和戏剧艺术工作者、我们的全体知识分子以自己的创作积极参加苏维埃社会的建设活动，忠实地为人民服务。共产党认为文学艺术工作者是自己的忠实朋友，是思想斗争中的助手和可靠支柱。党关怀文学艺术的繁荣、高度思想性和艺术技巧。我国人民需要反映劳动热情的、为人民所理解的文学作品、绘画和音乐。社会主义现实主义方法为创作这样的作品提供了无限的可能性。党进行着不可调和的斗争，反对异己思想的影响渗入文学艺术，反对敌意地攻击社会主义文化。
    现在，文学艺术方面的思想斗争的复杂性和独特性就在于，我们不仅要保护文学艺术不受外来的攻击，而且要防止个别创作工作者想把文学艺术推上不正确的道路，使它们脱离主要的发展路线。
    主要的发展路线就是：要使文学艺术永远同人民生活不可分割地联系着，真实地反映我们的丰富多彩的社会主义现实，鲜明而且确凿地揭示苏联人民的伟大的改造活动、他们的高尚的意愿和目标以及高尚的道德品质。文学艺术的最崇高的社会使命，就是鼓舞人民为争取共产主义建设的新成就而奋斗。
    同志们，必须承认，在作家和艺术工作者中间，还有个别的人有时候丧失立场，离开了正确的道路。这些人错误地和歪曲地对待文学艺术的任务。他们企图把事情看作这样：仿佛文学艺术的使命只是寻找缺点，主要是谈生活中的不良现象和阴暗面，而对一切正面的东西则闭口不谈。不过要知道，正是生活中这种正面的、新的和进步的事物是蓬勃发展着的社会主义社会现实中的主要东西。
    抱有这种错误的和有害的观点和情绪的人，反对那些在作品中真实和鲜明地描绘了苏维埃社会蒸蒸日上的发展和我们同时代人的正面形象的作家和美术家。被吹毛求疵者轻蔑地按上“粉饰太平的人”绰号的人们中间，有格里巴切夫同志这样的作家以及其他一些人。
    我们支持那些在文学中采取正确立场、描写生活中正面事物的作家。这并不等于说，他们所写的每一部作品都没有任何缺点，都不能受到批评。在这些同志的创作工作中可能也有过个别的错误偏好，但是这不给予任何人以理由和权利来责骂他们，否定他们所作的有益事情。
    大概有人企图把这样评价文学生活中的事实和现象说成是号召大家片面地反映生活，隐讳我们现实中的缺点和困难。但是，我们事先就坚决地消灭这一类恶劣的企图。
    没有人能够指责我们共产党人害怕批评，极力粉饰和掩盖工作中的缺点。历史经验证明：害怕批评和自我批评是没落阶级及其政党的本性。共产党，作为最先进阶级的政治领导者，作为建设共产主义的人民的领袖，在马克思列宁主义这种实质上最具有革命性和批判精神的理论的旗帜下进行着伟大的改造活动。它对于在走向伟大目标的道路上的任何困难过去不曾害怕过，现在也决不害怕，它永远勇敢地、坦率地面向着真理。它为人民利益服务，公开而不留情面地揭露和批评缺点和错误，并且和群众一道，为了我们共同事业的胜利规定消除缺点和纠正错误的途径。
    共产党和它的中央委员会在自己的整个活动中作出了应该如何揭发和消除缺点的榜样。例如，大家还记得党的一些决议：关于农业问题的决议，关于改组管理工业和建设的决议，关于给予地方机关更大的权力和发挥它们在工作中的主动性的决议，关于精简国家机关、党的机关和改进领导作风和领导方法的决议。批判个人崇拜，为消除个人崇拜的后果而进行坚持不懈的斗争，这难道不是我们党的高度的列宁主义原则性、果断和决心的证明吗？第二十次党代表大会的决议和各次中央全会的决议都充满了布尔什维克批评和自我批评的精神，充满了对缺点和错误的不调和的精神。伟大的列宁教导我们，原则性的政策是唯一正确的政策。党要求每一个共产党员、每一个党机关和国家机关的工作人员对所担任的工作具有高度责任心，并且党也要严惩一切在实际工作中脱离党的政治路线以及忘记党和人民的利益的人。无论工作人员担任什么职务以及他过去有什么功绩，都没有而且也不能使他避免批评，使他卸去对党和人民应负的责任。
    整个问题在于站在什么立场上和抱着什么目的来进行批评。我们揭露和批评缺点和错误，是为了消除我们道路上的这些障碍，为了更加巩固我们的苏维埃制度和共产党的阵地，保证新的胜利和更迅速的前进。而某些文学家是怎样来批评缺点的呢？他们不懂得生活，没有具备必要的政治经验，不善于看到生活中主要的和决定性的一面，他们抓住某些工作人员的缺点和错误，不加分析和思考把一切混为一谈，吓唬自己也企图吓唬别人。
    例如，作家杜金采夫就陷入这种不体面的处境。他在那本目前国外反动势力力图利用来反对我们的“不仅仅是为了面包”作品中满怀偏见地引用了一些反面的事实，并且从对我们不怀好意的立场作了歪曲的叙述。杜金采夫的书中也有一些地方是正确的，写的有力量，但是这本书的总方向根本是不正确的。读者感到，这本书的作者对于消除他在我们生活中所发现的缺点并不关心，他在故意渲染缺点，对于缺点采取幸灾乐祸的态度。在文学艺术作品中用这样的态度来描写现实，不外是企图歪曲现实和颠倒黑白。
    不能不令人遗憾的是，某些文学艺术杂志和出版局竟没有注意到这种不健康的有害的倾向，没有及时地对这种倾向给予正确评价和反击。“新世界”杂志编辑部竟腾出篇幅来刊登像杜金采夫这本书一样的作品。一些文学艺术杂志的编辑部和某些出版局的领导人没有很好掌握工作，在许多场合下丧失了原则性立场。这些同志开始忘记，报刊是我们主要的思想武器。报刊的使命是打击工人阶级和劳动人民的敌人。军队没有武器，不能作战；党缺少像报刊这样尖锐的战斗武器，也就不能有效地进行思想工作。我们不能把报刊交给不可靠的人，它应该由最忠诚、最可靠、政治上坚定和忠于我们事业的工作人员来掌握。
    由于忘记了这一点，作家协会的某些机关刊物不但没有始终不渝地坚持文学中的原则性路线，反而受到了某些立场不正确的人的严重影响，实质上也就成了不健康的情绪和倾向的传播者。这种情况特别表现在“莫斯科文学”丛刊上。这个丛刊中刊登过一些思想方面有缺点的作品和文章，曾经引起我国公众、首先是作家们的尖锐指责。在作家协会理事会全体会议上有许多文学家很公正地讲到了这一点。但是这个丛刊的编辑委员会的成员并不尊重这种对他们的错误的批评，不尊重他们写作上的同志——作家们的意见，同时避免对他们所采取的立场表示坦率和诚实的态度。特别应该提一提阿利格尔同志，她直到现在还抱着这样的看法：仿佛“莫斯科文学”丛刊的路线是正确的，她并且为这个丛刊中刊登过的偷运同我们格格不入的思想的作品作辩护。
    文学家和艺术家常常谈到党性和人民性，谈到创作自由和党的领导。这些问题是值得严重注意的。这些问题之值得一谈，特别是因为关于这些问题曾经说过和写过许多迷惑人的谬论，而这引起了人们思想上的混乱，妨碍正确理解党在文学艺术问题方面的政策以及党领导这个最重要的思想工作领域的列宁主义原则。
    下面是对文学艺术的党性和人民性的一些意见。首先不能对立地理解党性和人民性。苏维埃社会主义社会的力量在于共产党和人民的一致。代表人民根本利益的共产党的政策构成了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的最重要基础。因此，如果认为在我们苏联的条件下不积极参加实现共产党的政策也可以为人民服务，那就大错特错了。不接受党的观点和党的政治路线，就休想同人民一道并肩前进。谁要同人民在一起，谁就要永远同党在一起。谁坚定地站在党的立场上，谁就永远同人民在一起。
    艺术创作中的党性并不在于艺术家形式上有没有党籍，而要看艺术家的信念和他的思想立场如何。我们有不少优秀的作家，他们并不是党员，但是他们的作品就其思想内容和政治方向来讲都具有深刻的党性，并且有权利被人民认为是表达他们利益的作品。
    如果一个艺术家的生活目的是为共产主义的理想和本国人民的幸福而奋斗，如果他极端关心人民的利益、人民的思想和愿望，那么他不管选取何种题材，不管反映何种生活现象，他的作品都会符合人民、党和国家的利益。
    这样的艺术家就是自由地、毫不勉强地、按照自己的信念和使命、按照内心的吩咐选择为人民服务的道路。在社会主义社会的条件下，人民是真正掌握自己命运的自由的主人和新生活的创造者，一个忠实为人民服务的艺术家就没有创作自由不自由的问题。对于这样的艺术家说来，对待现实现象的态度问题是明确的，他不需要迁就，不需要勉强自己，从共产主义的党性立场来真实地描述生活是艺术家内心的要求，他坚定地站在这个立场上，在自己的创作中保护和捍卫这种立场。
    文学艺术作品在真实地描述社会和人民的生活的时候，既要展示社会主义现实的积极的、光辉的和鲜明的方面——社会主义现实的基础，也要反映对缺点的批评以及对妨碍我们一往直前的消极现象的揭发和谴责。
    在生活中，在现实中，除了积极的东西以外总还有消极的东西，杂草往往同鲜花生长在一起。对现实的反映完全取决于作者。如果他站在党的立场上，为人民服务，真诚地愿意帮助人民建设新社会，为建设共产主义的斗争扫清道路，那么，这样的作家、艺术家、雕刻家和作曲家就可以在工人、集体农民、知识分子的生活中，在个别人的生活中，在企业、集体农庄、国营农场的全体人员的生活中，找到十分优秀的范例，并且能够反击消极的东西，支持积极的东西，用鲜明的色彩把这种积极的东西真实地表现出来。如果作者不喜欢本国人民的成就，他就只会去搜寻恶劣的消极的东西，去挖掘垃圾坑，并且把这些东西冒充生活中具有特征的东西。
    我们过去和将来都坚决地和不可调和地反对文学艺术对我们的现实作片面的、不公正的和不真实的描述。我们也反对有人只搜寻生活中的反面事实，对它们表示幸灾乐祸的态度，企图诋毁和诬蔑我们的苏维埃制度。我们也反对那些描绘一些甜蜜的图景来污辱我国人民的感情的人，因为我国人民是决不会接受也不会容忍任何虚伪的。苏联人反对像杜金采夫的小说“不仅仅是为了面包”这样实质上是诬蔑性的作品，同时也反对像“难忘的一九一九年”或“幸福的生活”这样一些粉饰的谄媚的影片。
    遗憾的是，在文学艺术工作者中间，我们会碰到这样一些“创作自由”的卫士，他们希望我们对那些歪曲苏维埃社会生活的作品不要过问，不要发表意见，不要提出原则性的估价，也不要进行批评。原来这些人是厌恶党和国家对文学艺术工作的领导的。他们有时候是公开地反对这种领导，而更经常的是发表关于监护过多、创造性受到束缚等论调来掩盖自己的这种情绪和愿望。
    我们坦率地说，这种观点是同党和国家对文学艺术问题的态度的列宁主义原则相违背的。大家知道，列宁考虑到文学艺术的全部特征，不止一次地指出，党不能放弃对社会精神生活的这个重要部分的领导，他作为党的领袖和苏联政府的首脑在自己的实际活动中始终不渝地贯彻了这个原则。列宁指出，生活在社会中却要离开社会而自由，这是不可能的。同时，他还着重指出，社会主义社会的自由文学将同工人阶级保持公开的联系，它将为劳动人民的利益和社会主义思想所鼓舞。
    列宁对那些在文学艺术问题上放弃原则路线而且对思想错误采取自由主义态度的人，是不调和的。
    苏维埃社会的全部发展史最令人信服地证明，党和国家的领导，它们对艺术创作的注意以及对作家、艺术家、雕刻家和作曲家的关怀，保证了文学艺术的杰出的成就，保证了苏联各族人民的社会主义文化的繁荣。在党的关于思想问题的决议中，已经确定了文学艺术方面的最重要任务和党的基本政策原则，这些原则至今是仍然有效的。最重要的原则之一是，苏联文学艺术同作为苏维埃制度最重要基础的共产党的政策有着不可分割的联系。艺术家和作曲家在不久前举行的代表大会上发言的时候已经说到了这些决议的巨大的积极的意义。
    当然，不能否认，在斯大林的晚年，在个人崇拜的情况下，曾经发生过一些错误。举这样一个例子。我费了很大的气力才使得马克西姆·雷利斯基这样一个很有功绩的作家没有因为他那本充满深刻的爱国的感情的诗集“母亲”而受到严厉的批评。这种毫无根据地指责和攻击雷利斯基的主要原因，是他那本歌颂苏维埃乌克兰的诗集中没有提到斯大林的名字。于是一味谄媚和尽力鼓吹对斯大林个人崇拜的卡冈诺维奇同志就把马克西姆·雷利斯基说成是乌克兰资产阶级民族主义者。卡冈诺维奇同志利用了斯大林的弱点，他不去考虑对可敬的乌克兰爱国作家雷利斯基进行这些没有根据的指责会给乌克兰文学，而且不仅仅是给乌克兰文学，带来怎么样严重的后果。应当指出，这样做将不仅仅给文学带来严重的后果。
    不用说，我们反对以这样的态度来评价文学作品。
    党坚决地谴责了并且正在彻底纠正个人崇拜时期在生活的各方面、包括在思想工作上所犯的错误。但是，党同时也坚决反对那些企图利用过去的这些缺点来反对党和国家领导文学艺术的人。只有不同意党在这方面的政策的人，才会以这样的立场来反对对文学艺术的领导。使我们痛心的是，在这样一些人中间也有个别的党员作家。其中某些同志不愿意按照党章所规定的党的纪律的要求来行动，他们对党的纪律和党员的义务持有主观主义的解释，他们空谈什么以“创造性的态度”对待党的领导，来掩饰自己的非党行为。这些离开了集体的、不协同行动的孤立者的这种谬误的立场，在作家协会理事会全体会议上，在莫斯科作家会议上，在各加盟共和国和自治共和国、边疆区和州的一切作家组织中，受到了党员作家和非党作家的公正谴责。我十分满意地支持在这里发言的非党作家索波列夫同志，因为他在同不健康的情绪和倾向的斗争中采取坚定的、原则性的、不调和的立场。我不想隐瞒，对于我这个苏联共产党中央委员会的书记，非党作家索波列夫同志在文学的党性问题上的立场要比党员作家阿利格尔同志的立场接近得多，因为阿利格尔同志立场错误，并且不正确地对待对她的错误的批评。
    某些抱有自由主义情绪的人可能会责备我，说我在号召斗争。是的，我们从来都不隐瞒，我们过去和现在都号召进行原则性的思想斗争。在现代世界上，社会主义思想体系和资产阶级思想体系正在进行剧烈的斗争，而且在这种斗争中，中间立场是不可能有的。
    文学艺术是在为确立我们共产主义思想体系而跟同我们格格不入的资产阶级文化影响、跟过时的概念和观点进行斗争的条件下发展的。
    如果我们袖手旁观，对那些想把同苏联人的精神背道而驰的资产阶级观点偷运到我们文学艺术中来的企图采取消极的漠不关心的态度，那么我们就不是马克思列宁主义者了。必须清醒地观察事物，清楚地认识到敌人是存在的，敌人企图利用思想战线来削弱社会主义的力量。在这种情况下，我们的思想武器应该准备得很好，随时加以运用。匈牙利事件发生的时候，反革命为了自己的卑劣目的利用了某些作家，这个教训提醒我们，对于敌视社会主义的各种反动势力的阴谋，如果不从政治上加以监视，采取无原则和无主见的态度，将会产生什么后果。每一个人都应当明白，在目前社会主义力量和帝国主义反动势力正在进行激烈斗争的条件下，必须时时刻刻提高警惕。
    在我们谈话的进程中，关于同思想错误和不健康情绪进行斗争的问题被尖锐地提了出来。对于这些问题不能想像有其他的提法。不搞彻底或不谈清楚，会给事业带来严重的损失。
    我们希望在原则性的基础上而不是在让步和脱离马克思列宁主义原则的基础上巩固和团结文学艺术的一切力量。为了这种巩固，现在正展开原则性的批评和自我批评。这种批评可以帮助犯错误的人认识和改正自己的错误，更坚定地站稳立场，提高创作积极性。在展开批评和自我批评的时候，必须仔细分析某人的错误是偶然性的还是反映了他一系列的观点和他的行为的一定路线，必须考虑到这个人对待批评的态度。每个人都可能犯错误，应当不仅看到一个人昨天做了什么，而且也应当看到他明天能做什么，这是主要的，我们应当帮助这种人认识缺点，尽快消灭缺点和改正错误。
    例如，大家知道，社会舆论对我们的著名诗人特瓦尔多夫斯基同志的工作中的某些缺点也提出了批评，他是被公认为对苏联文学的发展作出贡献的人。同特瓦尔多夫斯基同志的友好谈话使人有理由希望这位语言艺术家一定会作出必要的结论，用自己的新的优秀作品使读者欢喜。社会舆论也曾经严厉批评了像潘菲洛夫同志这样大作家的缺点。我们认为这是正确的。潘菲洛夫同志本人现在承认，批评对于他是有好处的。
   原则性批评的目的是要在创造劳动上帮助文学艺术工作者，使他们能更加卓著成效地为我国人民谋取福利，使他们积极参加人民为争取共产主义而进行的斗争，并以自己的作品来丰富苏维埃社会主义文化。
    我们的苏维埃制度和共产党不止一次地挽救了那些甚至被认为是不可救药的和毫无希望的人，使他们积极地参加工作。在文学艺术界中有不少这样的例子：创作家经过批评之后创造出了艺术巨著。如果谈到杜金采夫同志，我认为，在我们的帮助和他主观努力之下他是能够站到正确道路上来的，并且将和全体作家一起为人民的利益、为社会主义祖国的利益而进行富有成果的劳动。
    各种创作协会应当在文学艺术的发展方面，在每个作家的思想教育和创作生活方面起非常重要的作用；这些协会应当真正成为在原则性的基础上紧密团结、积极战斗的集体。必须使创作协会里有真正的友谊，使每个作家、美术家、雕刻家、电影工作者、音乐工作者或戏剧工作者经常能在那里得到对他的创作发展的同志式的关怀。集体应当及时支持任何好的作品，支持在创作工作中的有益的倡议的出现。及时指出个别创作工作者的缺点和错误，防止他们有脱离原则性立场的可能性，给予需要帮助和支持的人以帮助和支持，这也是很重要的。
    文学家和艺术家是为共产主义而奋斗的积极战士。他们的优秀作品教育着千百万人。这就使我们的创作协会及其党组织有责任进行经常的巨大的思想教育工作，以马克思列宁主义理论知识和对共产党政策的正确理解来武装我们的创作工作者。应当使我们的所有创作工作者清楚地认识到他们在争取共产主义的全民斗争中所起的重大作用和对人民的高度责任感。
    我们的创作组织正在为实现第二十次党代表大会在文学和艺术方面所提出的任务而进行巨大的工作。不久前举行的各作家协会的全体会议、艺术家的代表大会和作曲家的代表大会，使得创作力量的积极性有了提高，增进了他们的团结。很值得高兴的是，在我们乌克兰共和国和白俄罗斯共和国，在中亚细亚、外高加索和波罗的海沿岸各共和国，作家协会的活动积极起来了。
    但是，在许多创作组织的工作中还存在着很大的缺点。应该指出，最近在拥有一支巨大文学家队伍的苏联作家协会莫斯科分会的工作中发现了缺点。在莫斯科的作家会议上有人发表过违反党在文学艺术方面的政策的错误言论。遗憾的是，这些言论往往没有得到应有的反击，莫斯科作家的党组织的工作也往往没有达到应有的水平。大家知道，乌克兰、白俄罗斯和其他几个加盟共和国的作家协会很注意作家协会莫斯科分会的情况，对发表在“莫斯科文学”丛刊中的许多思想上不健康的文学作品和文章提出了正确的批评。
    不能容忍作家协会莫斯科分会的工作中的这样重大的缺点，因为它是应该为其他城市的创作协会作出榜样来的。我们希望，作家们在党组织的帮助之下自己分析这些缺点的原因，并且采取措施来纠正这种情况。
    这里提出了关于组织俄罗斯联邦作家协会的问题。我认为，应该支持这个建议，成立俄罗斯联邦作家协会。其他的加盟共和国都有作家协会，而俄罗斯联邦的作家却没有自己的协会，这不能认为是正常的。当然，作家协会莫斯科分会不能够代表俄罗斯联邦的所有作家。同时，应该注意到俄罗斯联邦是一个多民族的自愿联盟。参加联邦的除了各边疆区和州以外，尚有十四个自治共和国、七个自治州和十个民族专区。
    成立俄罗斯联邦作家协会将是党中央和苏联政府为了进一步扩大加盟共和国的权力和发挥俄罗斯联邦的作用所采取的重大措施之一。除了应当作为俄罗斯联邦作家协会注意中心的创作思想问题以外，还要对于有助于发展地方写作力量的措施作慎重的考虑。应该关心的是，为自治共和国、边疆区和州的作家的经常性创作工作创造必要的条件，例如，必须调整地方出版社的稿费和分配出版文学作品的纸张。
    我们的会晤和座谈是有成果的。在这几次会晤中，我们就文学艺术工作者的生活和工作中的一些十分重要的问题坦率地交换了意见。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，顺利地实现着苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议及其所制定的共产主义建设计划。今年，我们要庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。我国人民将以在经济和文化建设方面、在提高人民福利方面所取得的卓绝的胜利来迎接这个具有重大历史意义的日子。在人民的社会政治生活中已经取得的成就是多么的巨大啊！第二十次党代表大会具有历史意义的决议得到了我国人民热烈的拥护，它掀起了最广大群众的政治积极性、劳动积极性和创造主动性的空前高潮，并且为进一步发扬人民的才能创造了条件。在宏伟的创造性建设工作中，劳动人民的共产主义觉悟不断在提高，苏联人——新时代的人、共产主义的建设者——的卓越的品质和优良的性格与精神面貌愈加充分地表现出来了。
    波澜壮阔的十月革命巨浪不可阻挡地在向前翻滚，它冲扫着走向共产主义社会的道路上的一切障碍和阻力。
    历史经验证明，我们并不是沿着一条已经开辟好的平坦的道路向共产主义迈进的。向那些在共产主义建设者先进行列中挺进的人提出的要求是：善于清晰地看到伟大的目标和向这个目标前进的远景，深刻理解社会发展的规律性，要有充沛的精力和坚忍不拔的意志，要不怕困难和不遗余力地铺平道路，引导千百万新社会建设者前进。
    我国四十年来的社会主义建设经验证明，苏联人民紧密地团结在自己的久经考验的领袖共产党周围，以百战百胜的马克思列宁主义革命理论把自己武装起来，一定能够光荣地完成摆在自己面前的各项伟大的历史任务。毫无疑问，苏联的作家、诗人、美术家、雕刻家和作曲家今后仍将不愧为自己的社会主义祖国的儿子，他们将贡献出自己的全部力量和才能来歌颂我国伟大的人民——共产主义社会建设者的英雄功绩。
