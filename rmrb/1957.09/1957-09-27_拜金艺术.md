The Art of Mammon
        Luó Sūn

        Thirty years ago, American writer Upton Sinclair published a book called "The Americanization of Art," in which the first article was "The Art of Mammon," exposing how bourgeois literature and art had degenerated to the point of "writing for money." The fact that artists can sell everything for money is the true nature of capitalist society. Sinclair began the preface to this book by saying, "From my childhood to my adolescence, I often heard the saying: 'Money talks!'" He changed this to: "Money writes well!" In a word, it is writing for money. Bourgeois artists have degenerated from "art for art's sake" to "art for money's sake." This is not surprising.

        Sinclair himself followed this path. He was once a "revolutionary writer" because he had written novels exposing the evils of American capitalist society, such as "The Jungle," "King Coal," and "Oil!" But he eventually degenerated into a money-worshipping speculator serving the big American bosses, and finally became a running dog of fascism. When he first started writing novels, he made money by peddling low-level interests. When Gorky's novel "Mother" was published in 1906, this world-shaking work influenced Sinclair. It should be said that what interested Sinclair was the great impact of "shaking the world," so he wrote the exposé novel "The Jungle," which did indeed "shake" him for a while, but soon he continued to play tricks with "sexual literature" for eleven years, until the October Revolution of 1917 touched his "inspiration" again, and he wrote "King Coal." However, this Mammon-worshipping artist never forgot the basic requirement of "writing for money." He himself said: "Anyone who can succeed in the art world will wear a protective armor and live like a turtle." Subsequently, this speculative Mammon-worshipping artist took refuge at the feet of the ruling class and served imperialist fascists. At this time, he wrote a massive ten-volume novel, depicting the adventure story of an ambitious American colonist, Lanny Budd, which is actually an aggressive story of the expansion policy of American imperialism. The main theme of the book is to incite anti-Soviet war. This Mammon-worshipping artist finally degenerated into a reactionary pawn in the fascist camp. This is not surprising, because all his actions are dominated by money, and with money he can sell his soul and sell everything.

        This thoroughly reactionary and decadent bourgeois Mammon-worshipping viewpoint has also found a market in our literary and artistic field today. This market is the bourgeois individualism that occurs in the minds of intellectuals.

        In his speech at the enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association, Comrade Qian Junrui pointed out: "We must be especially vigilant against the development of bourgeois individualistic ideas in the literary and art circles. After the national victory, this individualistic tendency in the literary and art circles to pursue personal fame, status, and enjoyment has developed to a very terrible degree in many departments and among many people. The creative activities of these people are primarily for money, for fame, and for level of treatment."

        This decadent individualistic thinking is precisely the hotbed for the development of Mammon art. With works, there is everything, and no one can "defeat" them, and they can bargain with the Party, and they can put their position above the organization. All this is money, status, and fame. This "one-bookism" thinking is essentially no different from Sinclair's "Mammonism." Therefore, it has played a great disintegrating role in the literary and art circles, and it is disintegrating from the depths of the mind, grasping the vital point of the individualist's soul. Sha Meng directed a film called "Shangganling," and his tail immediately perked up. The factory paid him 1,400 yuan as remuneration, and he嫌少 (xián shǎo: complained it was too little). He shamelessly made a big fuss, and even after it was increased to 1,600 yuan, he was still dissatisfied. Another director, Lü Ban, even openly called for "struggling for Renminbi." Wang Ruowang wrote essays to "get some pocket money." When he handed over a film script to the film studio, he actually said to the editor: "You can modify it however you want, as long as you give me 4,000 yuan." What kind of writers and artists are these? Where is there even a little sense of responsibility for literary and artistic creation, and where is there even a trace of an attitude of serving the people? Their goal is to "make money," to achieve a "double harvest of fame and fortune." The hearts of these people have been soaked in dirty copper stink. Besides personal fame, fortune, status, and enjoyment, there is nothing else. How can we talk about being "engineers of the soul"! They are a bunch of "soul moths," bourgeois decadent Mammon-worshipping philistines.

        It is inconceivable that a Mammon-worshipping "artist" who "struggles for Renminbi" can produce real works of art. In their souls, stained with the stink of copper, they are concerned day and night about money, fame, rank and treatment, and even the "artistic conscience" once praised by the bourgeoisie is sold off. They attempt to expand the influence of bourgeois Mammonism, to corrode and disintegrate the socialist literary and artistic cause led by the Party, and to play a vanguard role in the restoration of capitalism, first establishing a bourgeois literary and artistic position in the literary and artistic field. They attempt to use the characteristics of individual labor in literary and artistic activities, and to use the characteristics of easily creating fame and status in society, to encourage some people with weak will, weak Party spirit, and individualistic "unclean six roots," to deliberately pursue fame and fortune. Once they are hooked, they can be pulled and mixed together, becoming a member of their anti-Party group and the bourgeois literary and artistic camp. Wang Ruowang's becoming a "fellow writer" in the "fellow writer publication" designed by the Ding-Chen anti-Party group is an example.

        This group of Mammon-worshipping artists, in order to pursue personal fame and fortune, can sacrifice and disregard the interests of the Party, the interests of the collective, and the interests of the entire socialist literary and artistic cause. Even in order to achieve personal ambition, once the position is set up, they immediately turn their guns and aim at the Party and the socialist literary and artistic cause, launching vicious and fierce attacks.

        Their path is not much better than that of Sinclair, who wrote "The Jungle." Under the banner of Mammon art, it is not difficult to understand that they have degenerated into anti-communist, anti-socialist, and anti-people bourgeois rightists.

        People should be vigilant! When a grain of dust from the bourgeois individualistic Mammon art contaminates people's souls, they begin to embark on a reactionary and degenerate path!

    拜金艺术
    罗荪
    三十年前，美国作家厄普登·辛克莱出版过一本书，叫做“美国文艺界的怪状”，其中第一篇文章是“拜金艺术”，暴露了资产阶级文学艺术已经堕落到“为金钱而写作”的地步。艺术家为了钱可以出卖一切，这是资本主义社会的本色。辛克莱在这本书的序言中，开始就说：“自我的孩童时代以至少年时代，常常听见一种口头禅：‘金钱说得话响’！”他把这句话改成：“金钱写得文通”！一句话，就是为了金钱而写作。资产阶级的艺术家已经从“为艺术而艺术”堕落到“为金钱而艺术”了。这原是不足为奇的。
    辛克莱自己就走了这样一条道路。他一度曾经是“革命作家”，因为他曾写出过暴露美国资本主义社会罪恶的小说：“屠场”、“石炭王”、“煤油”等，但他终于堕落为美国大老板服务的拜金主义的投机分子，最后成为法西斯的一条走狗。他一开始写小说的时候，就是以卖弄低级趣味换钱的。1906年高尔基的小说“母亲”出版了，这部轰动世界的作品影响了辛克莱。应该说使辛克莱发生兴趣的是“轰动全世界”的伟大影响，于是他写了暴露小说“屠场”，这也确实曾使他“轰动”过一时，但不久，他又继续在“性的文学”上耍了十一年的把戏，一直到1917年十月革命才又触动他的“灵机”，写了“石炭王”。但是这位拜金艺术家始终没有忘记“为金钱而写作”的基本要求，他自己就说过：“凡是能在艺术界得到成功的人，都是会穿起护身的甲胄，像乌龟一般生活着的”。随后这位投机的拜金艺术家就投靠在统治阶级脚下，为帝国主义法西斯服务了，这时他写了一部洋洋十大卷的小说，描写一位野心勃勃的美国殖民者蓝尼·勃特的冒险故事，其实就是美帝国主义扩张政策的侵略故事，全书的主旨是煽动反苏战争。这个拜金艺术家终于堕落到法西斯阵营中充当一名反动的走卒了。这是并不奇怪的，由于他的一切行动是为金钱所支配的，有了钱就可以出卖自己的灵魂，出卖一切。
    这种彻头彻尾的反动的、腐朽的资产阶级拜金主义的观点，竟也在我们今天的文艺领域中找到了市场，这个市场就是发生在知识界头脑里的资产阶级个人主义。
    钱俊瑞同志在中国作家协会党组扩大会上发言中指出：“我们必须特别警惕文艺界资产阶级个人主义思想的发展。全国胜利后，文艺界的这种追求个人名誉、地位、享受的个人主义倾向，在不少部门和不少人中间，已经发展到了非常可怕的地步。这些人的创作活动，首先是为了钱，为了成名，为了级别待遇。”
    这种腐朽的个人主义思想，正是发展拜金艺术的温床。有了作品，就有了一切，就谁也“打不倒”了，就可以向党讨价还价了，就可以把自己的位置放在组织的上面了。这一切就是金钱、地位、名誉。这种“一本书主义”的思想和辛克莱的“拜金主义”在实质上并没有什么两样，也正因此，它在文艺界起了很大的瓦解作用，而且是从思想深处进行瓦解的，是抓住了个人主义者灵魂深处的要害的。沙蒙导演了一部电影“上甘岭”，尾巴马上翘起来，厂方付给他一千四百元报酬，他嫌少，居然恬不知耻地大吵大闹，增加到一千六百元，他还不满。另一位导演吕班竟然公开地号召“为人民币而奋斗”了。王若望写杂文是为了“弄几个小菜钱”，写了一个电影剧本，交给电影厂时居然向编辑说：“你们怎么修改都行，只要给我四千元钱就行了”。这是什么作家，什么艺术家？哪里还有一点点对文艺创作的责任感，哪里还有一丝一毫的为人民服务的态度？他们的目的就是为了“捞钱”，来一个“名利双收”。这些人的心灵已经为肮脏的铜臭所浸透了，除了个人的名利、地位、享受之外，什么也没有了。哪里还谈得上什么“灵魂工程师”！他们是一批“灵魂的蛀虫”，资产阶级腐朽的拜金主义的市侩。
    不可设想，一个“为人民币而奋斗”的拜金主义的“艺术家”，可以产生出真正的艺术品来，在他们沾满铜臭的灵魂深处，日夜计较的是金钱和名位、级别和待遇，甚至连资产阶级曾经称道过的“艺术的良心”也一并出卖了。他们企图扩大资产阶级拜金主义的影响，来腐蚀和瓦解党所领导的社会主义文艺事业，为资本主义复辟起先锋作用，首先在文艺领域中建立资产阶级文艺阵地。他们企图利用文艺活动的个人劳动的特点，利用容易在社会上造成声名和地位的特点，来鼓舞一些意志薄弱、党性不强、个人主义的“六根不净”的人，刻意追求名利，一旦上了钩，拉拉扯扯，就可以混在一起了，成为他们反党集团和资产阶级文艺阵营中的一个成员了。王若望之成为丁、陈反党集团所设计的“同人刊物”中的一个“同人”，就是例证。
    这一伙拜金艺术家们，为了追求个人的名利，对党的利益、集体的利益、整个社会主义文艺事业的利益，都可以牺牲，都可以置之不顾；甚至为了达到个人的野心，一旦布好阵地，就马上掉转枪口，对准了党，对准了社会主义文艺事业，进行恶毒而凶狠的攻击。
    他们的道路，并不比那个写过“屠场”的辛克莱好多少。他们在拜金艺术的大旗下，堕落为反共反社会主义反人民的资产阶级右派分子，是不难理解的。
    人们应当警惕！资产阶级个人主义的拜金艺术的一粒灰尘，沾染了人们的灵魂的时候，他就开始走上了反动的堕落的道路！
