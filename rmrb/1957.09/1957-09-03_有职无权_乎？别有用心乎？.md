　　“The Communist Party does not trust non-Party members,” “Non-Party members have titles but no power.” These are the poisonous arrows frequently used by rightists when attacking the Communist Party. The reporter recently visited the leaders of the Communist Party groups of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Justice, the Department of Forestry, and the Department of Transportation, which are headed by rightists as directors and deputy directors. They refuted this fallacy with numerous concrete facts.

　　Judging from the cases of the exposed rightists Jiang Zhenzhong (Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League), Li Shihao (Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party), and Cai Yiming (Deputy Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party), the lie of "having the title but no power" is untenable. Jiang Zhenzhong was the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Justice, Li Shihao was the Director of the Department of Forestry, and Cai Yiming was the Deputy Director of the Department of Transportation. In terms of actual authority, Jiang Zhenzhong and Li Shihao were responsible for the leadership of the entire department. Jiang Zhenzhong was also assigned to directly lead the two most important sections of the three sections of the Department of Justice; Cai Yiming was assigned to lead the basic construction of transportation. All administrative telegrams and documents of the Department of Justice and the Department of Forestry were first sent to Jiang Zhenzhong and Li Shihao for approval. Even internal documents of the Communist Party, as long as they contained instructions regarding the principles and policies of justice and forestry, were also sent to them by the Communist Party group to read. All department meetings and important meetings convened by the department were presided over by them, and they made the conclusions. Meetings on basic construction convened by the Department of Transportation were also presided over by Cai Yiming. When the Communist Party groups of the Department of Justice and the Department of Forestry discussed the principles, policies, and cadre issues of business operations, they invited Jiang Zhenzhong and Li Shihao to participate and solicit their opinions. When the Department of Justice and the Department of Forestry made summaries, work reports, and work plans, they were asked to offer their opinions, and Jiang Zhenzhong and Li Shihao made the final decisions, without any omissions.

　　But what were the performances of these rightists in their work? Jiang Zhenzhong mostly only announced the opening of the meeting and did not speak when he presided over department meetings. Jiang Zhenzhong rarely looked at the official documents sent to him for approval carefully, only signing his name and never expressing his opinions on the issues raised in the documents. Cai Yiming was often late and left early, closing his eyes to rest in the office. When Communist Party cadres asked him for instructions on work, he always refused with the words "My blood pressure is too high" and "I don't understand the situation." The Communist Party group invited him to attend group meetings to study work, but he never expressed his opinions. In 1955, the Department of Transportation gave Cai Yiming 754 official documents for approval, but because he rarely came to the department to work, he only approved 208 of them. Jiang Zhenzhong never went to the sections to understand the situation and give instructions in the two years he served as the Director of the Department of Justice.

　　Compared with Jiang Zhenzhong and Cai Yiming, Li Shihao was "active" in the work of the Department of Forestry, but his "activeness" was actually using the convenience of his position to attack the Communist Party. When the Communist Party group of the Department of Forestry, according to the instructions of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Forestry, proposed that the direction of forest farms in Zhejiang Province should focus on developing timber forests, Li Shihao flew into a rage, saying that it should focus on developing diversified operations, and refused the advice of the Party group, deploying his own plan at the provincial forest farm work conference, which resulted in many forest farms destroying seedlings, delaying seedling supply and afforestation work, causing huge losses.

　　In addition to being idle and disruptive in their work, these three rightists also actively engaged in some improper activities using their positions. Li Shihao once proposed to transfer two bad elements (members of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party) who had been expelled by the government from Zhuji County to the Department of Forestry to serve as office directors, and boasted that these two people were capable, "both literary and military," and said: "If they come, the work of the office will have a way out." The Department of Transportation sent Cai Yiming to Huangyan to participate in the completion ceremony of a bridge. When he arrived in Huangyan, he did not ask about the quality of the bridge project. As soon as the ceremony was over, he hurriedly took a car to Wenzhou City to engage in activities of recruiting followers. Jiang Zhenzhong usually never approached the cadres below, but during the period of great blooming and contending, he suddenly became interested in a young female Communist Party member who had just graduated from university in the department, asking her what level she was, saying that her salary was too low, and advising her to take time to go to the Zhejiang Medical College to read the anti-Communist program written on the reactionary big-character posters, attempting to stir up this young person's dissatisfaction with the Communist Party.

　　Despite the fact that the Communist Party gave Jiang Zhenzhong and others full trust, they were still clamoring about "having the title but no power." Cai Yiming said: "When I go to the bureaus below to check on work, I can't solve problems as well as a Party member section chief." In fact, he had never gone to the bureaus to check on work in the Department of Transportation for more than two years. These facts prove that what these rightists demand is not the legitimate power to serve the people under the leadership of the working class, but an attempt to usurp the leadership of the Communist Party.

### “有职无权”乎？别有用心乎？

    “有职无权”乎？别有用心乎？
    新华社记者  张济生
    “共产党不信任党外人士”、“党外人士有职无权”，这是右派分子在向共产党进攻时经常使用的毒箭。记者最近访问了由右派分子担任厅长、副厅长的浙江省司法厅、林业厅和交通厅的中共党组负责人，他们用无数具体事实驳斥了这种谬论。
    就从已揭露出来的右派分子姜震中（民盟浙江省委主任委员）、李士豪（农工民主党浙江省委主任委员）和蔡一鸣（农工民主党浙江省委副主任委员）三人的情况来看，所谓“有职无权”的谎言都不堪一驳。姜震中是浙江省司法厅长，李士豪是林业厅长，蔡一鸣是交通厅副厅长。在实际职权上，姜震中、李士豪都担负着整个厅的领导工作，姜震中还分工直接领导司法厅三个处中最重要的两个处；蔡一鸣分工领导交通运输方面的基本建设。司法、林业两厅所有的行政电报、文件都首先送给姜震中和李士豪批，即使是共产党内的文件，只要是有关司法和林业方针、政策的指示，中共党组也都送给他们看。所有的厅务会议以及厅里召集的重要会议都由他们主持，并由他们作结论。交通厅召开的关于基本建设的会议也都由蔡一鸣主持。司法厅和林业厅的中共党组讨论业务工作的方针、政策和干部问题时，都邀请姜震中和李士豪参加，征求他们的意见。司法厅、林业厅在做总结、工作报告和工作计划时，都请他们提出意见，并由姜震中、李士豪最后决定，从无疏忽遗漏。
    但是，这些右派分子在工作中的表现又是怎样？姜震中每次主持厅务会议时大都只宣布开会，不发言。送给他批的公文，姜震中很少认真细看，只签个名就算，对公文中所提出的问题从不表示意见。蔡一鸣经常迟到早退，在办公室闭目养神，当共产党员干部向他请示工作时，他总是用“血压太高”、“不了解情况”的话来拒绝。中共党组每次邀他列席党组会议研究工作，他从不发表意见。1955年一年中，交通厅交给蔡一鸣审批的公文有七百五十四件，由于他不大到厅办公，只批了二百零八件。姜震中在担任司法厅长的两年中，从来没有到处里去了解过情况和指示过工作。
    和姜震中、蔡一鸣比较，李士豪对林业厅的工作是“积极”的，但他的“积极”实际上是利用业务上的便利来向共产党进攻。当林业厅中共党组根据中共中央农村工作部和中央林业部的指示，提出浙江省林场方针应以发展用材林为主时，李士豪大发脾气，说应该以发展多种经营为主，并且拒绝党组劝告，在全省林场工作会议上布置他自拟的方案，结果使得许多林场毁掉苗木，耽误了苗木供应和造林工作，造成巨大损失。
    这三个右派分子除了在工作上怠工、捣乱外，还利用职权积极进行一些不正当活动。李士豪曾经提出要把诸暨县两个被政府开除的坏分子（农工民主党员）调到林业厅来当办公室主任，并且吹嘘这两个人有本领，“能文能武”，还说：“他们要是来，办公室的工作就有办法了。”交通厅派蔡一鸣到黄岩去参加大桥完工的典礼，他到了黄岩不问大桥的工程质量如何，典礼一完便匆匆乘汽车到温州市去搞招兵买马的勾当去了。姜震中平时从不与下面干部接近，在大鸣大放期间，他忽然对厅里一位新从大学出来的年轻女共产党员发生了兴趣，问她是什么级别，说她的工资太低，并且劝她抽空到浙江医学院去看反动大字报上所写的反共纲领，企图煽起这个青年人对共产党的不满。
    尽管共产党对姜震中等人给予了充分的信任，他们仍然在叫嚣“有职无权”。蔡一鸣说：“我到下面局里去检查工作，还不如一个党员处长解决问题。”实际上，他在交通厅两年多从来没有到局里检查过工作。这些事实证明：这些右派分子所要求的并不是在工人阶级领导下为人民服务的正当职权，而是企图篡夺共产党的领导。
