The National Trade Union Activists Representative Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is an important conference. The army of trade union activists is a force that cannot be ignored in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our country's working class ranks have developed rapidly. By the end of 1956, there were more than 22 million people, and there were more than 3 million trade union activists, almost one activist for every six employees. The important significance of this matter lies not only in the size of this team, but also in the fact that this huge team lives with the masses every moment and has a close, flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses.
    Trade union activists are people worthy of respect. After completing their tasks in their production posts, they use part of their rest time to serve the masses without compensation. They do not seek fame or fortune, do not complain of hardship, and perform their glorious social obligations day and night, working hard and bearing hardships without complaint. They give meticulous care and help to the production, life, and study of the workers and masses. They themselves are models and examples for the masses in these aspects. Many trade union activists are advanced producers or advanced workers, learning models, and models of unity, mutual assistance, diligence, and thrift. Precisely because of this, trade union activists have been warmly loved by the masses, who call them people who "provide charcoal in the snow" and "provide umbrellas in the rain," and regard them as their role models.
    Relying on these conscious activists who are closely connected with the masses, the trade union organization unites the masses and mobilizes the masses to play a significant role in the country's socialist construction. It is precisely because these activists widely and frequently connect with the masses that the trade union can truly become a working-class organization with broad mass character, and that the trade union can truly unite the masses around the Party and closely link the masses with the Party. We believe that as long as we are good at using this force and summarizing the existing experience in this regard, the trade union will be able to play a greater role in future work.
    Now, people of all strata of the country are carrying out the rectification movement, and the masses of workers across the country are also entering the rectification movement one after another. In this movement, the masses of workers will put forward criticisms and suggestions to the leaders of various enterprises to help them improve their work. At the same time, they will also launch discussions and debates on the Party and the people's government's various guidelines and policies on socialist transformation and socialist construction, correct wrong opinions, and expose and criticize reactionary opinions, in order to conduct in-depth socialist education. Therefore, the most urgent issue facing trade union organizations across the country is to play a full and active role in this movement, and to help workers raise their revolutionary consciousness, help rectify the working-class ranks, and help correctly resolve contradictions within the working class through various forms such as group meetings, symposiums, big-character posters, and debates.
    There are various contradictions within the people and within the working class, and what is particularly important for trade union workers is the contradiction between leaders and the masses. If the contradiction between leaders and the masses is properly handled, many other contradictions can be easily resolved. The most fundamental method for resolving this contradiction is to implement the mass line repeatedly emphasized by the Party. This requires trade union organizations to better connect with the masses, deeply understand and analyze all aspects of the contradiction, and resolve this contradiction according to the principle of "unity-criticism-unity" pointed out by Chairman Mao. By resolving this contradiction, we can further improve the consciousness of the masses and strengthen the ties between leaders and the masses. Lenin once pointed out in the document "The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions Under the New Economic Policy": "As long as the remnants of capitalism and small production still exist, the contradiction between these remnants and the new socialist sprouts in the entire social system is inevitable. … In order to effectively carry out trade union work, it is not enough to just correctly understand the tasks of the trade union, and it is not enough to just have a correct trade union organization; there must also be a special kind of tact, good at approaching the masses in each specific situation, using special methods, to elevate these masses to a higher level in culture, economy, and politics with minimal friction."
    In order to closely connect leaders and the masses, we need to start from two aspects: on the one hand, strengthen mass supervision and overcome bureaucracy; on the other hand, strengthen political and ideological work and improve the class consciousness of workers and masses. Both of these aspects require trade union organizations to be good at using activists to carry out in-depth and meticulous mass work.
    Trade union organizations should mobilize the masses, enlighten the masses' sense of responsibility as masters, and regularly and conscientiously expose the bureaucratic phenomena in the leadership work of enterprises. The administrative leaders of enterprises should also sincerely welcome mass criticisms and opinions in this regard. However, the responsibility of trade union organizations must not be limited to "exposing" and "criticizing." This is just the presentation of the problem. To solve the problem, we also need to further mobilize the masses with the attitude of masters, find solutions to the problem, and help the leaders to overcome bureaucracy. When the trade union organization of the No. 53 Factory was solving the problem of overtime, it initially only criticized and blamed, but did not solve the problem. It was not until the fourth in-depth investigation, relying on the power of the masses themselves, improving the work, and improving the leadership, that the phenomenon of frequent overtime was basically eliminated. This shows that solving this contradiction must fully follow the mass line. In this way, not only can the legitimate demands of the workers and masses be met, and the leadership can be improved and bureaucracy overcome "with minimal friction," but also the masses can be improved and unity strengthened.
    Strengthening political and ideological work among the masses is another aspect of the work of trade union organizations in resolving the contradiction between leaders and the masses. Because the masses do not understand the overall situation, or cannot correctly handle the relationship between individual interests and national interests, it is also often a reason for the occurrence of internal contradictions in enterprises. When carrying out this work, it is also necessary to fully follow the mass line. Top-down systematic publicity and education work is necessary, but this is only an educational method for a small number of activists. Political education for the masses mainly involves enlightening the masses to carry out self-education. That is, to educate the masses themselves with the masses' own personal experiences and insights. Moreover, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to participate in various major political movements and ideological struggles, so that the masses can be educated and tempered in the struggle. The socialist education movement that is about to be launched in factories and mines is a mass self-education movement. The method of following the mass line should be implemented to continuously improve the socialist consciousness and organizational level of the masses. In this way, the labor enthusiasm of the workers and masses will be greatly enhanced, labor discipline will be greatly strengthened, and some unreasonable demands of the masses will also be consciously abandoned, prompting the contradiction between leaders and the masses to be eased and resolved.
    The above two aspects are enough to illustrate that only when the trade union organization fully follows the mass line can it play a greater role in correctly handling contradictions among the people. This is precisely the weakness of the work of many grassroots trade union organizations, which needs to be overcome.
    Implementing the mass line requires giving full play to the role of activists and requires good summarizing and utilization of the experience of activists. The experience exchanged at the National Trade Union Activists Representative Conference is mostly experience in implementing the mass line in various aspects of grassroots work. These experiences are reflected in activists in various fields. Activists are the backbone force for implementing the Party's mass line. Leaders rely on them to combine themselves with the masses, and through them, "from the masses, to the masses," "concentrate and persevere." Whenever a mass movement is launched, without the backbone role of activists, the enthusiasm of the masses will not last, and the mass movement will not develop healthily. Every leader must fully recognize the importance of activists. Correctly using activists and giving full play to the role of activists are of great significance for strengthening grassroots work and for implementing the mass line in grassroots work. The individual strength of activists is limited; only by organizing can they become a huge force. The vast number of trade union activists have already been organized in the trade union, which can be said to be an extremely favorable condition. To give full play to their strength, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over trade union organizations and give full play to the organizational role of trade unions.
    The National Trade Union Activists Representative Conference has concluded, and the representatives attending the meeting will return to their work posts and work hard together with the thousands upon thousands of trade union activists who did not attend the meeting to continue to work hard for the socialist cause and for the close ties between the Party and the masses. We wish them greater achievements in their work. We also hope that they can maintain their glory, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and always advance with the masses under the leadership of the Party.

### 工会要依靠积极分子贯彻群众路线

    工会要依靠积极分子贯彻群众路线
    全国总工会召开的全国工会积极分子代表会议是一个重要的会议。工会积极分子大军在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中是一支不可忽视的力量。我国工人阶级队伍迅速发展，1956年底已有二千二百多万人，而工会积极分子就有三百多万人，几乎每六个职工当中就有一名积极分子。事情的重要意义不仅在于这支队伍的庞大，而且还在于这支庞大的队伍每时每刻同群众生活在一起，同群众有千丝万缕的血肉般的联系。
    工会积极分子是值得人们尊敬的人。他们在完成了自己生产岗位上的任务之后，利用自己的一部分休息时间毫无报酬地为群众服务。他们不为名利、不辞辛苦、日日夜夜、任劳任怨地执行他们光荣的社会义务。他们对于职工群众的生产、生活、学习都给予无微不至的关怀和帮助。他们自己在这些方面又是群众的模范、表率。许多工会积极分子，是先进生产者或先进工作者，是学习模范，是团结互助、勤俭持家的模范。正是因为这样，工会积极分子得到了群众的热诚爱戴，称他们是“雪里送炭”和“雨中送伞”的人，把他们当作自己的榜样。
    工会组织依靠着这些有觉悟的同群众密切联系的积极分子，团结群众、发动群众，在国家的社会主义建设事业中发挥了重大的作用。正是由于这些积极分子广泛地经常地联系着群众，才使工会真正成为具有广泛群众性的工人阶级的组织，才使工会真正能够把群众团结在党的周围，把群众与党紧密地联系起来。我们相信：只要善于运用这支力量，总结起这方面已有的经验，工会就能够在今后工作中发挥更大的作用。
    现在全国各阶层人民正在进行整风运动，全国工人群众也正在陆续进入整风运动。在这一运动中，工人群众将向各企业的领导者提出批评建议，帮助他们改进工作，同时也将对党和人民政府关于社会主义改造和社会主义建设的各项方针政策，展开讨论和辩论，纠正错误的意见，揭露和批判反动的意见，以便深入地进行社会主义教育。因此，摆在全国工会组织面前的最迫切的问题，就是在这一运动中发挥充分的积极的作用，通过小组会、座谈会、大字报、辩论会等种种形式，帮助工人群众革命觉悟的提高，帮助工人阶级队伍的整顿，帮助工人阶级内部矛盾的正确解决。
    人民内部和工人阶级内部有各种矛盾，而对于工会工作者特别重要的，是领导和群众的矛盾。正确处理好了领导和群众的矛盾，其他许多矛盾也可以迎刃而解。而解决这个矛盾最根本的方法就是贯彻执行党所一再强调的群众路线。这就需要工会组织更好地联系群众，深入了解和分析矛盾的各个方面，根据毛主席所指出的“团结——批评——团结”的方针来解决这个矛盾，通过解决这个矛盾又进一步提高群众的觉悟，密切领导和群众的联系。列宁在“新经济政策下工会的作用和任务”的文件中曾经指出：“当资本主义和小生产底残余依然存在时，整个社会制度中这些残余与社会主义新芽之间的矛盾，是无可避免的。……为了有效地进行职工会工作，只是正确了解职工会的任务是不够的，只有正确的职工会机构是不够的；还必须有一种特别的机智，善于在每个具体情况下，用特别的办法去接近群众，以最小的磨擦，而能在文化、经济和政治方面把这些群众提升到更高的程度上去。”
    为了密切领导和群众之间的联系，需要从两方面着手，一方面就是加强群众监督，克服官僚主义；一方面就是加强政治思想工作，提高职工群众的阶级觉悟。这两方面，都需要工会组织善于运用积极分子进行深入的细致的群众工作。
    工会组织应该发动群众、启发群众的主人翁责任感，经常地认真地揭露企业领导工作中的官僚主义现象，企业行政领导也应该诚恳地欢迎这方面的群众批评和意见。但是，工会组织的责任决不能只满足于“揭露”和“批评”。这只是问题的提出。要解决问题，还需要进一步发动群众以主人翁的态度，寻找解决问题的办法，帮助领导来克服官僚主义。五三厂工会组织在解决加班加点问题的时候，开始只是批评指责，但并未解决问题，一直到第四次进行了深入的调查，依靠了群众自己的力量，改进了工作，改进了领导，才基本上消除了经常加班加点的现象。这就说明了解决这个矛盾必须充分走群众路线。这样，不仅可以满足工人群众的正当要求，“以最小的磨擦”改进领导，克服官僚主义，而且还可以借此提高群众，加强团结。
    加强群众中的政治思想工作，是工会组织在解决领导与群众矛盾当中另一个方面的工作。因为群众不了解全面情况，或者不能正确地处理个人利益同国家利益之间的关系，也常常是发生企业内部矛盾的一个原因。在进行这个工作的时候，也须要充分走群众路线。自上而下的系统的宣传教育工作，是必要的，但这只是对少数积极分子的教育方式。对群众的政治教育，主要是启发群众进行自我教育。这就是以群众自己的亲身经历和体会来教育群众自己。并且，要发动群众参加各种重大的政治运动和思想斗争，让群众在斗争中受到教育、受到锻炼。目前在厂矿企业即将开展的社会主义教育运动，就是群众性的自我教育运动，应该贯彻群众路线的方法，以不断提高群众的社会主义的觉悟程度和组织程度。这样，将使职工群众的劳动积极性大大发挥，劳动纪律大大加强，某些群众的不合理的要求也将会自觉地放弃，促使领导与群众的矛盾得到缓和与解决。
    以上两方面都足以说明，只有当工会组织充分走了群众路线，它才能在正确处理人民内部矛盾中发挥更大的作用，而这一点正是目前不少工会的基层组织的工作弱点，需要加以克服的。
    贯彻群众路线，需要充分发挥积极分子的作用，需要很好地总结和运用积极分子的经验。全国工会积极分子代表会议上交流的经验，其中绝大多数就是在基层各个方面的工作中贯彻群众路线的经验。这些经验从各方面的积极分子身上体现出来。积极分子是贯彻党的群众路线的骨干力量。领导者依靠他们把自己同群众结合起来，通过他们“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来，坚持下去”。每当发动一个群众运动的时候，如果没有积极分子的骨干作用，群众的热情将不能持久，群众运动将不能健康地发展下去。每一个领导者都要充分认识到积极分子的重要性。正确使用积极分子，充分发挥积极分子的作用，对于加强基层工作，对于在基层工作中贯彻群众路线，具有重要的意义。积极分子个人的力量是有限的，组织起来，才能成为一支巨大的力量。广大工会积极分子已经组织在工会之中，应该说这是一个极为有利的条件。要充分发挥他们的力量，必须加强党对工会组织的领导，充分发挥工会的组织作用。
    全国工会积极分子代表会议闭幕了，出席会议的代表们将要回到自己的工作岗位上去，同那些没有出席会议的千千万万的工会积极分子们一起，继续为社会主义事业、为密切党和群众的联系去努力工作。我们预祝他们的工作获得更大的成就。我们也希望他们能够保持光荣，戒骄戒躁，永远和群众一起，在党的领导下不断前进。
