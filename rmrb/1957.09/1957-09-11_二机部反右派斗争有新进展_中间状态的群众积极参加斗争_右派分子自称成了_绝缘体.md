　　Reported by our newspaper: Over the past two months, after full and reasoned struggle, the broad masses of the Second Ministry of Machine Building have received profound education, their awareness has greatly increased, and the rightist elements have been completely isolated. The rightist elements themselves say that they have become "insulators" and are "foul-smelling."

　　Like other ministries, this ministry also saw rightist elements stir up trouble and frantically attack the Communist Party and the socialist system at the beginning of the rectification campaign. The rightist element Wang Fen (engineer) was the vanguard of the First Design Institute's attack on the Party. He wanted "old cadres to return to the countryside to grow Chinese cabbage" and let "large intellectuals" lead. He slandered our "previous movements as being chaotic," demanding that some "deviationists" be found and punished. Wu Ping, a technician from the Fourth Bureau, was a pawn of the Zhang-Luo alliance that had stretched into this ministry. As the son of the rightist element Wu Wenzao, he "estimated the domestic and international situation" in a "family forum," attempting to organize a "voicing team" to "squeeze out a group of Party cadres and replace them with a group of democrats" to change the ministry's "uniformity." The rightist elements Wu Zhijun and Zheng Jiajun from the Sixth Research Institute both harbored deep hatred for the Party and the government because their fathers, who had committed many evils, had either been suppressed or sentenced. Wu Zhijun even vowed, "I would rather be a ghost of my class than a believer in the Communist Party," and declared that he would "avenge the killing of my father." Li Tao, a rightist element who had infiltrated the Party, consistently adopted a double-dealing approach, had deceived his way into the position of branch committee member and section chief, and had twice deceived his way into the title of advanced producer. This May, he and Zhang Guanghua, a rightist element from the First Ministry of Machine Building, jointly wrote a "Letter to Chairman Mao," openly advocating "abolishing the Party committee system" and "opening up a free market" to create conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

　　In late July, this ministry began a large-scale anti-rightist struggle. In order to carry out reasoned struggle against the rightist elements, the masses voluntarily went to department stores, bus companies, Sanyang Flour Mill, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and other units to investigate materials. For example, in order to refute Zheng Jiajun's slander of the Soviet Union, the comrades of the Sixth Institute went to the Ministry of Foreign Trade to investigate and made a report at the meeting. Before they finished speaking, the rightist elements said, "Don't talk anymore, I give in." In order to thoroughly refute the rightist elements from a theoretical point of view, a theoretical team was also specially organized for each major debate. For example, in refuting Li Tao's bourgeois revisionist ideology, the theoretical group investigated the production changes in capitalist and socialist countries and consulted Marxist-Leninist books and related papers. At each debate, many people also used their personal experiences to refute the fallacies of the rightist elements. Technician Gan Heqing said: Many of our cadres, especially old cadres, have worked hard in practice and have skillfully mastered technical management, and some have changed from "laymen" to "experts." How can you say that "the Party cannot lead technology"? How can you say that old cadres are "filling the ranks" and "relying on seniority"? The head of the professional design group said at the meeting that during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, a special agent stubbornly insisted that I was a "KMT secret agent." The leaders of the department, in order to clarify my problem, sent many people one after another, who did not spare any effort, and almost ran all over half of China to investigate, and finally came to the correct conclusion. If it were in the Kuomintang era, wouldn't my head have been chopped off long ago? The Communist Party is so responsible and so carefully handles a person's political problems. Isn't this the characteristic of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement? How can you say that "previous movements were chaotic"?

　　The lively movement has rapidly increased the awareness of the masses. In particular, the changes in the masses in the intermediate state are even more obvious. Hu Pinggao, an engineer who had worked with the rightist element Wang Fen in Tianjin, knew Wang Fen's background, but at first he couldn't bring himself to expose him. Under the influence of the mass struggle, he took the stage at the third conference and exposed that Wang Fen, who had originally claimed to be a "tiger fighter," was actually a "tiger" who had embezzled 12 million yuan (old currency). Wang Fen, who was still stubbornly resisting, immediately lowered his head. Many engineering and technical personnel over the age of thirty protested Wang Fen's slander that it was "impossible for them to be truly active." They unanimously stood up and said: Those who have suffered in the old society know better how lovable the new society is. They want to draw a clear line with the rightist elements and will never allow the rightist elements to slander and slander them. Some young people in the Mechanical Section who had been confused by Li Tao and followed him in attacking the Party also woke up in the debate and actively threw themselves into the struggle.

　　At present, this ministry is taking advantage of the victory to pursue the already exposed rightist elements, and is also comprehensively and deeply digging out the hidden rightist elements, in order to achieve a complete victory in the anti-rightist struggle.

### 二机部反右派斗争有新进展　中间状态的群众积极参加斗争　右派分子自称成了“绝缘体”

　　二机部反右派斗争有新进展
　　中间状态的群众积极参加斗争　右派分子自称成了“绝缘体”
    本报讯　两个多月来，经过充分的说理斗争，第二机械工业部的广大群众受到深刻教育，觉悟大大提高，右派分子已完全被孤立起来。右派分子自己也说他们已成了“绝缘体”。已“臭不可闻”了。
    这个部和其他部一样，在整风开始时，右派分子曾兴风作浪，猖狂地攻击共产党和社会主义制度。右派分子王汾（工程师）是第一设计院向党进攻的先锋。他要“老干部回农村去种大白菜”，让“大知识分子”来领导。他诬蔑我们“历次运动是乌烟瘴气”，要求找出几个“偏差分子”给以处分。四局技术员吴平是章罗联盟伸进这个部的爪牙。他是右派分子吴文藻的儿子，他在“家庭论坛”中“对国内外形势作了估计”，企图组织“鸣放队伍”“挤掉一批党员干部，换上一批民主人士”来改变这个部“清一色”的局面。第六研究所右派分子吴治均和郑家俊都因为他们作恶多端的父亲或被镇压或被判刑而对党和政府怀有刻骨的仇恨。吴治均甚至发誓：“宁为本阶级的死鬼，不当共产党的信徒”，并声言要“报杀父之仇”。混入党内的右派分子李滔一贯采取两面派的手法，曾骗取了支部委员和科长的职务，并两次骗得先进生产者的称号。今年5月他会同第一机械工业部右派分子张光华共同写了“致毛主席书”，公开主张“取消党委制”，“开放自由市场”，为恢复资本主义创造条件。
    7月下旬，这个部开始了大规模的反右派斗争。群众为了向右派分子开展说理斗争，曾自动到百货商店、公共汽车公司、三阳面粉厂和对外贸易部等单位调查材料。如六所的同志为了驳斥郑家俊对苏联的诬蔑，曾到对外贸易部去调查，回来在会上作了报告，还没有讲完，右派分子就说：“不要再讲了，我服了。”为了从理论上彻底驳倒右派分子，每次大的辩论会还专门组织了理论队伍。如对李滔的资产阶级修正主义思想的驳斥，理论组就调查了资本主义国家和社会主义国家的生产变化，翻阅了马列主义书籍和有关论文。在每次辩论会上，还有许多人用本人亲身经验来驳斥右派分子的谬论。技术员甘河清说：我们很多干部，特别是老干部在实践中刻苦努力，已经熟练地掌握了技术管理工作，有的已经由“外行”变成了“内行”。这怎么说“党不能领导技术”呢？ 这怎么能说老干部是“滥竽充数”“凭老资格下料”呢？专业设计组组长在会上说，在肃反运动中，曾有一个特务硬说我是“中统特务”，部的领导上为了弄清我的问题，先后派了许多人，不辞劳苦，几乎跑遍了半个中国去调查，最后得出正确的结论。如果在国民党时期不是早已人头落地了吗？共产党对一个人的政治问题如此负责，如此慎重地处理，不正是肃反运动的特点吗？怎么能说“历次运动是乌烟瘴气”呢？
    热火朝天的运动，使群众觉悟迅速提高。特别是中间状态的群众变化更加明显。原来在天津同右派分子王汾在一起工作过的工程师胡平高知道王汾的底细，但起初撕不开情面，不敢揭发。在群众斗争影响下，在第三次大会上走上了讲台，揭发了原来自称是“打虎队员”的王汾是地地道道贪污一千二百万元（旧币）的“老虎”。还在顽抗的王汾立即低下头来。许多三十岁以上的工程技术人员抗议王汾诬蔑他们“不可能真积极”的谰言。他们一致起立表示：受过旧社会苦难的人更知道新社会的可爱，要跟右派分子划清界限，绝不允许右派分子对他们诬蔑和中伤。曾被李滔迷惑，跟着他向党进攻的机械科一些青年在辩论中也清醒过来，积极投入了斗争。
    目前，这个部正乘胜追击已暴露的右派分子，并全面深入挖掘隐藏的右派分子，以便取得反右派斗争的彻底胜利。
