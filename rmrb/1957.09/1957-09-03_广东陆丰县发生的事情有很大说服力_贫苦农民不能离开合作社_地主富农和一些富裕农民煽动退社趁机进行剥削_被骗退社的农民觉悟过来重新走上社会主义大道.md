Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd—Exploitative phenomena such as usury and hiring laborers, which had disappeared after cooperativization, are now occurring again in areas of Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, where the dissolution of cooperatives and withdrawal from cooperatives are severe.

Since last year, Lufeng County has had many shortcomings in its cooperative management work. Some lawless landlords and rich peasants have taken the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities, and some wealthy peasants with serious capitalistic tendencies have also followed suit, inciting peasants to dissolve and withdraw from cooperatives. As a result, many poor and lower-middle peasants were once misguided. After many poor and lower-middle peasants left the cooperatives, they were again subjected to various forms of exploitation. According to incomplete statistics from two districts and one large township, 851 households have borrowed money at usurious rates, 43 households have sold land, and 156 households have sold late-rice seedlings. In Hukou Township, all 15 poor peasant households that withdrew from the cooperative borrowed money at usurious rates because they had no money to buy fertilizer. In the ninth cooperative of Nan'an Township, within two days of the cooperative's dissolution, 27 households began borrowing money at usurious rates. This phenomenon is more prominent in areas where cooperatives were dissolved earlier and more severely.

According to investigations, most of the people now engaged in exploitation are particularly wealthy peasants who took the lead in agitating for withdrawal from cooperatives. Chen Shuiping, a wealthy peasant in Longtou Village, Yanlong Township, immediately sold three large pigs and lent out 234 yuan at usurious rates after leading the withdrawal from the cooperative. Cai Songshuang, a wealthy peasant in Hukou Township, immediately lent money at a monthly interest rate of 40% (40 yuan interest per month for every 100 yuan) after inciting the dissolution of the cooperative. The cooperative in Xiachen Village, Shenpu Township, was destroyed by Zheng Fumin, a rich peasant. After the cooperative was dissolved, he, along with another rich peasant and a wealthy middle peasant, were the ones lending money.

The exploitation by these rich peasants and wealthy middle peasants is quite cruel. The monthly interest rate on usurious loans is generally between 2% and 4%. Currently, the late-rice seedlings sold by poor peasants are only equivalent to 30% of the autumn harvest yield. Poor and lower-middle peasants who have withdrawn from cooperatives have no choice but to universally sell their labor in exchange for the use of wealthy peasants' cattle and farm tools due to a lack of cattle and farm tools.

Now, many poor and lower-middle peasants who were deceived into withdrawing from cooperatives have begun to awaken. Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels and the People's Government, they are gradually returning to the path of cooperativization. To date, 175 agricultural cooperatives have been restored throughout the county, with 4,937 peasant households joining. More poor and lower-middle peasants are actively requesting to rejoin.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd—Poor peasants in Yanlong Township, Guangdong Province, who have tasted the pain of exploitation after withdrawing from cooperatives, are now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and through factual education, returning to the path of cooperativization.

In June and July of this year, a great evil wind blew through Yanlong Township. Some people were inciting that cooperatives were not good, and that it was better for everyone to be "free and independent." Many cooperatives in the township were blown apart by this evil wind, leaving only 28% of the poor and lower-middle peasants adhering to the path of cooperativization. Most of the peasants retreated back to the path of individual farming.

Was this return journey easy? The General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yanlong Township recently summarized the situation over the past two months, conducted in-depth propaganda, and mobilized everyone to discuss it, finally enabling the vast majority of peasants to find the correct answer.

After many cooperatives in Yanlong Township dissolved, exploitative phenomena such as usury, which had previously disappeared, reappeared. Throughout the township, 136 households borrowed 3,646 yuan at usurious rates, including 96 poor peasant households and 31 lower-middle peasant households. Throughout the township, 156 households sold 141 mu of late-rice seedlings, with the value only equivalent to one-third of the autumn harvest yield. Thirty-nine poor peasant households throughout the township had transferred all their land to others for cultivation because they were unable to cultivate it themselves. Xiachen Village in this township dissolved its cooperative at the end of last year. In the six months since the dissolution, 34 of the village's 42 poor peasant households borrowed 2,100 yuan. Among them, six households sold their cattle, 11 households sold their trees, and 34 households could not afford to raise pigs. Chen Shun, a poor peasant in Zhuzaiwei Village, borrowed 21 yuan at usurious rates after the dissolution of the cooperative. When he was unable to repay the loan, the creditor pressed him so hard that he was preparing to sell his son out of desperation. Fortunately, the Party branch discovered this and provided him with a loan, thus preventing the separation of flesh and blood.

The poor and lower-middle peasants who left the cooperative were in this situation. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants who persisted in the cooperative were in a completely different situation. None of them borrowed money, pawned land, or sold anything.

The ten poor peasant households in Liuyi Village were the poorest in the entire village. They were known as the "tails of the poor peasants." Before cooperativization, seven households regularly needed government relief. After joining the cooperative last year, they got enough to eat and wear for the first time. They deeply appreciated the benefits of cooperativization, and they resolutely did not dissolve their cooperative during this round of dissolutions. When others withdrew, these ten households ran it themselves. Although the cooperative was small, they had a reasonable division of labor and worked diligently. During the busy summer harvest and planting season this year, they were even able to divide into two teams, one doing field work and the other engaging in sideline occupations. As a result, not only did none of them borrow money or sell anything, but eight of them were also able to raise pigs. However, Cai Xiong, another poor peasant in this village, originally insisted on running the cooperative with these ten poor peasant households, but because he had more land, he thought it was not worthwhile to be with these poor people and withdrew from the cooperative halfway through. What about now? Because he was working alone and unable to manage everything, and because he encountered difficulties in life, he had to pawn off 1.6 mu of land.

Through the comparison of these facts, the question of which road was better was resolved. Since cooperativization was good, why did so many people withdraw from cooperatives? Now everyone has also found out the truth. It turns out that there were a total of 20 people who incited and took the lead in destroying cooperatives and sabotaging the state monopoly of purchase and marketing. Among these people, there were four landlords, seven rich peasants, and two released prisoners and people under surveillance. For example, the rich peasant Lin Da hired laborers and lent money before liberation, and he served as a puppet Jia chief, embezzling conscript money and porter money. After liberation, he was still unwilling to till the land and instead bought jute for speculative trading. After cooperativization last year, jute was subject to state monopoly purchase, and he could no longer engage in speculative business. Harboring resentment, he feigned joining the cooperative, and even secretly purchased a total of 900 jin of jute after joining. Among these 20 people, there were also seven wealthy middle peasants. For example, the wealthy middle peasant Chen Shuiping rented out land, hired short-term laborers, and lent "green seedlings" before liberation, with exploitative income accounting for 22% of his total income. After liberation, he still hired short-term laborers. Seeing that he could not hire laborers after cooperativization, and seeing that the whole township was building water conservancy projects, if he did not join the cooperative, his land would have to bear 200 yuan in water conservancy fees. That is why he joined the cooperative. Now, seeing that the water conservancy projects have been completed and his land has become better, he provokes the dissolution of the cooperative. After the cooperative was dissolved, he lent out 234 yuan of "green seedling" debt in his "freedom and independence." After the dissolution of the cooperative throughout the township, 16 wealthy peasant households have already lent money, mostly "green seedlings." If we calculate the more than 3,000 yuan of debt borrowed throughout the township, then approximately more than 60,000 jin of rice will flow into the hands of the creditors.

Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yanlong Township know that they have been deceived and are actively brewing to reorganize cooperatives. Currently, six new cooperatives are being set up. The cooperatives that have persisted are also preparing to expand.

    广东陆丰县发生的事情有很大说服力
    贫苦农民不能离开合作社
    地主富农和一些富裕农民煽动退社趁机进行剥削
    被骗退社的农民觉悟过来重新走上社会主义大道
    据新华社广州2日电  合作化后已经绝迹的高利贷、雇工等剥削现象，目前又在广东省陆丰县闹散社、退社严重的地方发生。
    去年以来，陆丰县由于在办社工作上有着较多的缺点，一些不法地主、富农乘机进行破坏活动，一些具有严重资本主义自发倾向的富裕农民，也跟着鼓动农民散社、退社，因此许多贫农和下中农成分的社员一度迷失了方向。许多贫农和下中农离开合作社后，重新受到了各种剥削。根据两个区一个大乡的不完全统计，现在便有八百五十一户借了高利贷，四十三户卖了田地，一百五十六户卖了晚造青苗。湖口乡十五户退社的贫农，出社后由于无钱买肥料，全都借了高利贷；南岸乡第九社八十六户在散社后的两天中，便有二十七户开始借高利贷。这种现象在散社愈早愈严重的地方愈为突出。
    据调查，现在从事剥削的人，大部分是带头闹退社的特别富裕的农民。炎龙乡陇头村富裕农民陈水平带头退社之后，立即卖了三头大猪，放了二百三十四元的高利贷；湖口乡的富裕农民蔡松双鼓动散社后，马上放了月息40％（每一百元每月利息四十元）的高利贷。深埔乡下陈村的合作社则是被富农郑福绵带头搞垮的，散社后放债的就是他同另一户富农和一户富裕中农。
    这些富农和富裕中农的剥削是相当残酷的，高利贷的月息一般是二分利到四分利。目前贫农卖出的晚造青苗，只相当于秋收产量的三成。出社后的贫农和下中农由于缺乏耕牛、农具，不得不普遍出卖劳力来和富裕农民的耕牛、农具“换工”。
    现在，许多被骗退了社的贫农和下中农，已开始觉悟过来。他们在各级党组织和人民政府的领导下，陆续地重新走上合作化道路。到目前为止，全县已经恢复了一百七十五个农业社，入社农民四千九百三十七户，还有更多的贫农和下中农积极要求重新入社。
    据新华社广州2日电  退社后备尝剥削痛苦的广东省陆丰县炎龙乡贫苦农民，在共产党的领导下，经过事实的教育，现在重新走上了合作化的道路。
    今年6、7月间，炎龙乡曾经刮起一阵大歪风，有人在煽动说合作社不好，不如各顾各“自由自在”。全乡不少合作社给这阵歪风吹得散了伙，只剩下28％的贫农和下中农坚持走合作化道路，大部分的农民都重新倒退到了单干的道路上去。
    这条回头路好不好走呢？中共炎龙乡总支部委员会最近总结了两个月来的情况，深入地展开宣传和发动大家讨论，终于使广大农民找到了正确的答案。
    炎龙乡不少合作社散伙之后，原来已经绝迹的高利贷等剥削现象又出现了。全乡有一百三十六户借了三千六百四十六元高利贷，其中贫农九十六户，下中农三十一户。全乡有一百五十六户把一百四十一亩晚造青苗卖出，价值只相当于秋收产量的三分之一。全乡有三十九户贫农因为无力耕种，已经把田地全部交给别人耕。这个乡的下陈村是在去年年底散社的，散社半年以来，全村四十二户贫农便有三十四户借债二千一百元，其中还有六户卖了耕牛，十一户卖了树木，三十四户没法养猪。竹仔围村贫农陈舜，散社后借高利贷二十一元，到期没法还，债主逼得紧，他正准备着忍痛卖掉儿子，幸亏被党支部发觉，贷款给他，才避免了骨肉分离。
    出了社的贫农和下中农是这样子。但是，坚持在社里的贫农和下中农都是另外一个样子，他们没有一户借债、典田、卖东西。
    六驿村的十户贫农是全村最穷的，他们被称为“贫农尾”。合作化之前，有七户经常要政府救济。去年入社后，他们第一次得到了温饱。他们深深体会到合作化的好处，在这次闹散社中，他们坚决不散。别人退社，他们十户就自己办。社虽小，但他们合理分工，辛勤劳动，在今年夏收夏种大忙中还能分成两套人马，一套做田里的工作，一套搞副业，因此他们不但没有一户借债卖东西，而且还有八户能够养猪。但是，这个村的另一个贫农蔡熊，本来是和这十户贫农一起坚持办社的，只因他田地较多，便以为和这些穷人在一起不合算，中途退了社。现在怎样呢？他因单枪独马，顾得东来丢了西，加上生活碰到困难，只好典出一亩六分田。
    经过这些事实的对比，路是那条好的问题解决了。既然合作化好，为什么有许多人要退社呢？现在大家也查清楚了。原来煽动和带头破坏合作社、破坏统购统销的一共有二十个人。这些人当中，有地主四人，富农七人，刑满释放分子和被管制分子二人。像富农林大，解放前就雇工放债，当过伪甲长，贪污过壮丁钱、挑夫钱。解放后，他仍不愿耕田劳动，而是买黄麻做投机买卖。去年合作化后，黄麻统购，投机生意做不成了，他怀恨在心，假意入社，入社后还私下套购黄麻共九百斤。这二十人当中，还有七个富裕中农。像富裕中农陈水平，解放前便出租田、雇短工、放“青苗”，剥削收入占总收入22％，解放后仍然雇短工。他见合作化后不能雇工了，又见全乡修水利，如果不入社，他的田地要负担二百元的水利费，这才入了社。现在，他见水利修好，他的田也变好了，便挑拨散社。在散社以后，他就在“自由自在”中放了二百三十四元“青苗”债。全乡在散社后，已经有十六户富裕农民放了债，放的多是“青苗”，如果计算全乡所借的三千多元债，就大约有六万多斤稻谷流入债主的手里。
    现在，炎龙乡的贫农和下中农知道受骗了，正在积极酝酿重新组织合作社。目前已有六个新社在搭架子。坚持下来的社也在作扩社的准备工作。
