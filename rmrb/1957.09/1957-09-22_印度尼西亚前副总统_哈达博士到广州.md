Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 21st: Former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Mohammad Hatta, along with his wife and a delegation of twenty-one people, arrived in Guangzhou by special train at 3:45 p.m. today. They were welcomed by Wei Jinfei, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou, Zhan Caifang, Lieutenant General of the Guangzhou Garrison, and people from all walks of life.

Dr. Hatta is visiting China at the invitation of Premier Zhou. Shen Bocun, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Committee of the CPPCC, went to Shenzhen to greet him.

In the evening, Wei Jinfei hosted a banquet to welcome the distinguished guests. Dr. Hatta spoke at the banquet. He said that Guangzhou is the first city he is visiting in the People's Republic of China. The welcome of the masses at the train station made him realize the closeness of the friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people. Dr. Hatta said that the goal of the Indonesian people in their struggle is for prosperous lives and for friendship between all countries. Indonesia has suffered imperialist invasion, so all aspects are very backward. Therefore, we must mobilize the strength of the whole country to build our country. For construction, we need peace and peaceful coexistence with all countries, and we need a peaceful environment for construction. Our people are proud that the Asian-African Conference was held in Bandung in 1955, and the goals of the Asian-African Conference are the goals of Indonesia.

Dr. Hatta said, my only hope is that friendly cooperation between China and Indonesia can promote and strive for world peace. All of us people around the world must promote the realization of peace and eliminate war. This is our ideal.

    印度尼西亚前副总统
    哈达博士到广州
    据新华社广州21日电　印度尼西亚前副总统穆罕默德·哈达博士偕夫人和随行人员一行二十一人，今天下午三时四十五分乘专车到达广州，受到广东省副省长魏今非、广州市市长朱光和广州驻军首长詹才芳中将以及各界人士的欢迎。
    哈达博士是应周总理的邀请前来访问我国的，政协全国委员会副秘书长申伯纯曾前往深圳迎接。
    晚上，魏今非设宴欢迎贵宾。哈达博士在宴会上讲话。他说，广州这个城市是我到中华人民共和国访问的第一个城市。在火车站上的群众对我的欢迎使我了解到印度尼西亚人民和中国人民友谊的密切。哈达博士说，印度尼西亚人民在斗争中的目标是为了生活繁荣，为了各国友好。印度尼西亚曾遭受帝国主义侵入，因此各方面都是很落后的。因此我们要动员全国的力量来建设我们的国家。为了建设，我们需要和平和与各国的和平相处，我们需要有和平的环境才能建设。我们的人民感到骄傲的是，1955年在万隆召开了亚非国家和平会议，亚非会议奋斗的目标就是印度尼西亚的目标。
    哈达博士说，我唯一的希望是通过中国和印度尼西亚两国友好合作能促进和争取世界和平。我们全世界人民都要促使和平实现，使战争消灭，这是我们的理想。
