Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th—Since Chongqing Iron and Steel Company launched the "Excellent Apprentice" competition in July, it has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of more than 1,000 apprentices to learn technology.

　　The apprentices generally expressed that they would strive to be excellent apprentices with practical actions of learning technology well, abiding by labor discipline, and uniting in production.

　　Since the start of the competition, labor discipline among apprentices has been strengthened. In the past, almost every workshop had phenomena such as being late, leaving early, and absenteeism without reason, but this situation has been greatly reduced now. Some workers who had repeatedly requested to change jobs or go to school in the past are now settling down and actively learning. Some apprentices not only concentrate on learning from experienced workers during work hours, but also use their spare time to go to the experienced workers' homes to ask for advice and help the experienced workers with chores such as carrying firewood and water.

　　With the help and guidance of the veteran workers, some of the faster-progressing apprentices are now able to master some relatively simple independent operations.

　　争取做个优秀学徒
    据新华社重庆12日电　重庆钢铁公司自从7月份开展“优秀学徒”竞赛，大大激发了一千多名学徒工学习技术的热情。
    学工们普遍表示要以学好技术、遵守劳动纪律、团结生产的实际行动争取做一名优秀学工。
    竞赛开始以后，学徒工劳动纪律加强。过去几乎每一个车间都存在着迟到早退、无故旷工等现象，现在这种情况已经大大减少了。有的工人过去三番两次要求调换工作，要求进学校，现在也安心下来积极学习。部分学徒工不但在上班时专心向老师傅学习，而且利用业余时间到老师傅家里请教，帮助老师傅挑柴挑水。
    在老工人的帮助和指导下，一部分进步较快的学徒工现在已经能够掌握一些比较简单的独立操作。
