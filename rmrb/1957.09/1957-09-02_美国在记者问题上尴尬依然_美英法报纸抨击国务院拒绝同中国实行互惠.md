Xinhua News Agency, August 31st -- Some bourgeois newspapers in the United States, Britain, and France have expressed opposition and condemnation of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's attitude of refusing to implement the principle of reciprocity with China on the issue of dispatching journalists.

The "New York Times" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "Let's Not Have a Curtain Here," saying, "We believe it was wrong for the Secretary of State to delay letting our own journalists enter Communist China, and then only agree to let our own journalists enter Communist China. We believe it is still wrong for him to refuse to grant 'reciprocal visas' to Chinese holding passports issued by the Communist Chinese regime." The newspaper advocated that American journalists should come to China to understand the so-called "real situation" in order to conduct an "ideological war" with communism.

The "New York Herald Tribune" published an editorial on August 27th saying, "The confusion created on this general issue has been going on for a year... America's prestige has not been enhanced." The State Department finally had to "agree to twenty-four journalists visiting mainland China."

The newspaper lamented the State Department's current embarrassing situation, believing that this should be entirely attributed to the "State Department's stupidity in handling this matter." The newspaper said, "If the State Department followed the traditional method recognized by the Constitution and allowed journalists to interview the news themselves, then even if the issue of reciprocity were raised, our country would have a much more advantageous basis." It said that the State Department could only blame itself for "any difficulties that the demand for the entry of Red Chinese journalists might cause—Senator Fulbright has already said that this should be done."

The British "Times" said in a commentary on the 28th that China's position on this issue was "reasonable." The newspaper said, "His (Dulles's) ban put him in a dilemma, and his subsequent partial withdrawal of his claim made him look ridiculous."

The "Manchester Guardian" said, "The root of the trouble is that Dulles wants to tell the press where they can go and where they can't go." The newspaper said that if, due to Dulles's attitude, "the Chinese withdraw their invitations, so that the American press complains even more fiercely than before, then the State Department can only blame itself. If the State Department had been quieter in the first place, none of this would have happened. Mr. Dulles brought trouble on himself."

The Paris "Le Monde" published a commentary on this issue on the 29th, believing that it was "not an exaggeration" to use the word "absurd" to describe American policy towards China.

### 美国在记者问题上尴尬依然  美英法报纸抨击国务院拒绝同中国实行互惠

    美国在记者问题上尴尬依然
    美英法报纸抨击国务院拒绝同中国实行互惠
    新华社31日讯  美国、英国和法国的一些资产阶级报纸对美国国务卿杜勒斯在派遣记者问题上拒绝同中国实行互惠原则的态度，表示反对和谴责。
    “纽约时报”27日以“让我们这里不要有帷幕”为题发表社论说，“我们认为国务卿迟迟不让我们自己的记者进入共产党中国，后来又只同意我们自己的记者进入共产党中国是错误的。我们认为他拒绝以‘互惠签证’给予持有中国共产党政权发给的护照的中国人仍然是错误的。”这家报纸主张应该让美国记者前来中国了解所谓“真实情况”，以便同共产主义进行“思想战”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”8月27日发表社论说，“在这个总问题上所造成的混乱已经有一年了……美国的威望并没有提高。”国务院最后还是不得不“答应二十四名记者去访问中国大陆”。
    这家报纸为国务院目前的尴尬处境惋惜，认为这应当完全归咎于“国务院在处理这件事情上的愚笨”。这家报纸说：“如果国务院依照宪法所承认的传统的办法，让记者自己去采访新闻，那末即使互惠的问题竟然会被提出来，我国也会具有一个有利得多的根据。”它说，对于“让红色中国记者入境的要求——参议员富布赖特已经说应该这样做了——这种压力可能引起的任何困难，国务院只能怪它自己”。
    英国“泰晤士报”在28日的一篇评论里说，中国方面在这个问题上的立场是“有道理的”。这家报纸说，“他（杜勒斯）的禁止办法使他陷于困境，他后来部分撤回他的主张使他看来成了可笑的人物。”
    “曼彻斯特卫报”说，“麻烦的根源是杜勒斯想要告诉报界什么地方能去什么地方不能去。”这家报纸说，如果由于杜勒斯的态度“中国人撤回了他们的邀请，以致美国报界抱怨得比以前更凶的话，那只能怪国务院自己。如果国务院首先就安静些的话，就不会有这些事。杜勒斯先生是自找麻烦”。
    巴黎“世界报”29日就这个问题发表评论，认为用“荒谬”这个字眼来形容美国对中国的政策是“并不过分的。”
