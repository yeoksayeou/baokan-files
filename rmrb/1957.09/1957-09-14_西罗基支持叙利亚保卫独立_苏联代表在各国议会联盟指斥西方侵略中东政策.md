Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 13th: Czechoslovak Premier Siroky said on the 12th that Czechoslovakia's sympathy and moral and political support are on the side of the just cause of the Syrian people and all people fighting for freedom and independence.

Siroky made these remarks at a banquet held in honor of the Mongolian government delegation. Siroky accused the United States of coercing, intimidating, and openly threatening Syria under the pretext that Syria was threatening the security of its neighbors. He said, however, that the whole world knows that the Arab people do not feel threatened by Syria at all. Syria is a peace-loving and independent country that is merely gloriously defending its sovereignty and national freedom, and is pursuing a policy of sincere cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and non-interference in internal affairs. There is no doubt that it is not Syria that is carrying out the threats, but primarily the United States. The United States is trying to force the Syrian people to accept the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" through threats, to subject Syria's national life to the interests of American monopoly capital, to accept the shackles of colonialism, and to turn Syria into a docile puppet of the imperialists. Premier Siroky said that Czechoslovakia fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal to Western countries to issue a statement of non-interference in the internal affairs of the Near and Middle Eastern countries.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The 46th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union opened on September 12th in Westminster Hall, London. The Soviet representative, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Paletskis, spoke to condemn the aggressive policies implemented by the imperialist bloc in the Middle East.

Paletskis said that the events in Oman, Yemen, and Syria all prove that the imperialist bloc is attempting to force Arab countries to join military blocs and accept their "doctrines." He said that it is now time to end the policies of "positions of strength" and "filling the vacuum."

　　西罗基支持叙利亚保卫独立
　　苏联代表在各国议会联盟指斥西方侵略中东政策
    据新华社布拉格13日电  捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基12日说，捷克斯洛伐克的同情和道义上、政治上的支持是在叙利亚人民和一切为自由、独立而斗争的人民的正义事业这边的。
    西罗基是在招待蒙古政府代表团的宴会上说这番话的。西罗基指责美国借口叙利亚威胁邻国的安全而对它进行的胁迫、恫吓和公开的军事威胁。他说，但是，全世界都知道，阿拉伯人民绝没有感到叙利亚的威胁，叙利亚是爱好和平的、独立的国家，它只是光荣地保卫着自己的主权和民族自由，并且执行着同一切国家在平等和不干涉内政的基础上进行真诚合作的政策。毫无疑问，进行威胁的绝不是叙利亚，而首先是美国。美国企图用威胁来迫使叙利亚人民接受所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，把叙利亚的民族生活屈从于美国垄断资本的利益、接受殖民主义的羁绊，变叙利亚为帝国主义者的忠顺的傀儡。西罗基总理说，捷克斯洛伐克完全支持苏联向西方国家提出的发表不干涉中近东国家内政的声明的建议。
    据新华社13日讯：各国议会联盟第四十六届大会9月12日在伦敦威斯敏斯特大厅开幕。苏联代表、苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席帕列茨基斯发言谴责帝国主义集团在中东所实施的侵略政策。
    帕列茨基斯说，在阿曼、也门和叙利亚所发生的事件都证明：帝国主义集团企图强迫阿拉伯国家参加军事集团和接受它们的“主义”。他说，现在已经是结束“实力地位”和“填补真空”政策的时候了。
