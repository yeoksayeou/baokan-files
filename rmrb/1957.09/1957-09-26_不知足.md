    Insatiable

    Some people say that they are eating less grain now than before, which I completely disagree with. Before Liberation (1948), I harvested 840 catties of rice, and after paying grain and taxes, it only amounted to 360 catties per person. During busy times, we ate one dry meal at noon, and during slack times, we ate thin porridge mixed with a large portion of vegetables. In 1954, my wife and I shared 960 catties, which amounted to 480 catties per person, 120 catties more than in 1948. Last year, we were allocated 530 catties per person, another 50 catties more than in 1954. It looks like this year will be no less than last year. In my opinion, some people are just insatiable!

    不知足
    有人说现在吃粮比以前吃少了，我完全不同意。解放前（1948年），我收八百四十斤稻谷，完粮纳税后每人只合三百六十斤，忙时中午吃一顿干的，闲时吃稀的还掺一大半菜；1954年我两个人分九百六十斤，每人合四百八十斤，比1948年多吃一百二十斤；去年分的每人合五百三十斤，又比1954年多吃五十斤；今年算起来又不少于去年。我看有些人就是不知足！
