Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Arita Hachiro, Advisor to the Japan Socialist Party, who was invited to visit our country by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, had contacts and talks in Beijing with Premier Zhou Enlai, the Institute of Foreign Affairs, and relevant personnel from the Red Cross Society of China. Xinhua News Agency reporters learned from the Institute of Foreign Affairs that when Arita Hachiro left Beijing on August 29, President Zhang Xiruo gave Arita Hachiro himself a copy of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs' memorandum on Arita Hachiro's talks with various parties in Beijing. The full text of the memorandum is as follows:

	Memorandum

Premier Zhou Enlai, President Zhang Xiruo, Vice President Qiao Guanhua, President Li Dequan of the Red Cross Society of China, Advisor Liao Chengzhi, and Advisor Zhao Anbo held talks with Arita Hachiro, Advisor to the Japan Socialist Party, respectively. The main points are as follows:

    I. On Sino-Japanese Friendship and Normalization of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations

Sino-Japanese friendship is conducive to safeguarding Asian peace and world peace. In order to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan as soon as possible, according to the joint statement issued in April 1957 by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Inejiro Asanuma, head of the Japan Socialist Party's visiting goodwill delegation to China, exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan should be promoted to enhance mutual understanding and friendship, prevent sabotage by third parties, and make Sino-Japanese friendly relations grow day by day.

    II. On the Issue of Japanese Nationals in China

    (1) The Japanese government should be fully responsible for explaining to the Japanese people the whereabouts of Japanese who engaged in war or lived in China before August 15, 1945.
    (2) The repatriation or residence of Japanese in China from August 15, 1945, to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 was handled by the then Chiang Kai-shek government, and the Chinese People's Government bears no responsibility for this.
    (3) Approximately six thousand Japanese nationals still reside in China from the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to today. If the three Japanese organizations request to understand the situation of these Japanese nationals, the Red Cross Society of China is willing to provide necessary assistance and investigation.
    If the three Japanese organizations apply to understand the situation of individual Japanese nationals during the period from August 15, 1945, to the founding of the People's Republic of China, and there is factual material to check, the Red Cross Society of China can also regard it as an individual exception and conduct an investigation within the scope of possibility.
    (4) If the Chinese side discovers, based on the factual materials provided by the Japanese side, that these Japanese have died in China and their remains can be found, the Red Cross Society of China is willing to provide assistance and return the found remains and ashes to the three Japanese organizations.
    (5) Regarding the above issues, the Red Cross Society of China and the three Japanese organizations have already reached an agreement. The two sides have been cooperating closely in accordance with these relevant agreements and have achieved good results. In the future, the Red Cross Society of China will continue to handle the above-mentioned issues in accordance with the agreements signed with the three Japanese organizations and use this as a normal procedure. However, this does not exclude the possibility of the National Council of Bereaved Families led by Mr. Arita Hachiro submitting requests through the three Japanese organizations or directly to the Red Cross Society of China. When the submitted requests have a certain result, the Red Cross Society of China will inform the National Council of Bereaved Families led by Mr. Arita Hachiro through the three Japanese organizations.
    (6) Since China and Japan have not yet restored diplomatic relations, it is impossible for the Chinese side to hand over the list of approximately six thousand Japanese nationals currently in China to Japan. However, if the Japanese side provides a list of Japanese nationals who were indeed in China after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese side can accept it and conduct individual investigations based on the factual materials provided by the Japanese side. Based on the above understanding, the Red Cross Society of China accepted the list of Japanese nationals in China after liberation submitted by Mr. Arita Hachiro.

    III. During the Japanese war of aggression against China, a large number of Chinese were abducted to Japan for forced labor, many of whom were killed or tortured to death by the then Japanese government.

The Chinese side hopes that after Mr. Arita Hachiro returns to Japan, he will find a way to hand over the list of Chinese who died in Japan during the Japanese war of aggression to the Red Cross Society of China, because this is strongly requested by the families of Chinese martyrs who died in Japan.

    Furthermore, Xinhua News Agency reporters learned from the person in charge of the Red Cross Society of China that since the agreement was reached in 1954 with the three Japanese organizations, namely the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, on assisting in the search for the whereabouts of Japanese nationals in China, the Chinese Red Cross Society has received more than 4,000 letters and materials from the Japanese people through the three Japanese organizations or Japanese delegations visiting China and individuals directly requesting the Chinese Red Cross Society to investigate Japanese who had resided in China. The Chinese Red Cross Society has made various efforts within its capacity to conduct individual investigations on these requests. The first batch of 286 Japanese whose whereabouts have been found have been notified to the inquirers and copied to the three Japanese organizations. More than 500 people have now been found, including 356 Japanese nationals, of whom 60 have returned to their home country and 8 have died; 142 Japanese war criminals, of whom 136 have been released by the Chinese government and assisted in returning to their home country by the Chinese Red Cross Society. After detailed verification of this investigation result, the three Japanese organizations and the inquirers will be notified separately.

    The situation of the remaining more than 3,000 letters is:

    (1) Japanese who disappeared before August 15, such situations are impossible to investigate, and the Japanese government should explain to the Japanese people.
    (2) Japanese who disappeared after August 15 during the Chiang Kai-shek government period, such situations are difficult to investigate, but individual investigations are still being conducted within the scope of possibility.
    (3) The person being inquired about has not provided any realistic investigation materials, so it is impossible to investigate.
    (4) According to the letter, the person being inquired about is not in China, so it is also impossible to investigate.
    (5) Japanese women who married Chinese people and used Chinese names, it is extremely difficult to investigate these people and it takes a lot of time.

    In addition, the list of Japanese nationals who are believed to still be in China after liberation recently submitted by Mr. Arita Hachiro will inevitably overlap with many of the above-mentioned more than 4,000 letters and materials. The Chinese Red Cross Society is verifying this, and this work also requires considerable time.

    Despite the many difficulties in the investigation work, the Chinese Red Cross Society is still willing to assist in the investigation as much as possible. As soon as results are obtained, the three Japanese organizations will be notified and they will be requested to inform the inquirers and the National Council of Bereaved Families led by Mr. Arita Hachiro.

    日本社会党顾问有田八郎在北京同各方面会谈的备忘录
    新华社2日讯  应中国人民外交学会会长张奚若邀请来我国访问的日本社会党顾问有田八郎，在北京期间，曾经同周恩来总理、外交学会和中国红十字会总会等有关方面人士分别进行了接触和交谈。新华社记者从外交学会获悉，在有田八郎8月29日离开北京的时候，张奚若会长曾经将中国人民外交学会方面关于有田八郎在北京同各方面会谈的备忘录一份交给了有田八郎本人。备忘录全文如下：
    备  忘  录
    周恩来总理、张奚若会长、乔冠华副会长、中国红十字会总会李德全会长、廖承志顾问、赵安博顾问等同日本社会党顾问有田八郎分别进行了会谈，要点如下：
    一、关于中日友好和中日国交的正常化
    中日友好有助于保卫亚洲和平和世界和平。为了尽速促进中日两国国交正常化，应该根据中国人民外交学会会长张奚若和日本社会党访华亲善使节团团长浅沼稻次郎在1957年4月发表的共同声明，促进中日两国人民间的来往和增进互相的理解和友谊，严防第三者的破坏，使中日友好关系日益增进。
    二、关于在中国的日本侨民问题
    （1）对于1945年8月15日以前，曾经在中国境内进行战争或者生活的日本人的下落，应该由日本政府负完全责任向日本人民作出交代。
    （2）从1945年8月15日到1949年中华人民共和国成立以前，在中国境内的日本人的遣返或者居留，是由当时的蒋介石政府负责处理的，中国人民政府对此不负任何责任。
    （3）1949年中华人民共和国成立以后直到今天，还留在中国居住的日本侨民大约六千名。如果日本三团体提出要求了解这些日本侨民的情况，中国红十字会总会愿意给予必要的协助和调查。
    如果日本三团体申请了解1945年8月15日以后到中华人民共和国成立以前这一段时期中个别的日本侨民的情况，而且有现实材料可查，中国红十字会总会也可以视为个别的例外，在可能范围内予以调查。
    （4）根据日本方面提出的现实材料，中国方面如果发现这些日本人已经死在中国，而且有遗骨可寻，中国红十字会总会愿意进行协助，并且把寻到的遗骨骨灰送还给日本的三团体。
    （5）关于以上问题，中国红十字会总会和日本三团体之间早已达成协议，双方向来根据这些有关协议密切合作，并且已经获得良好成绩。今后中国红十字会总会仍将根据同日本三团体签订的协议处理上述各项问题，并且以此作为正常手续。但是，这并不排除由有田八郎先生所领导的留守家族全国协议会，通过日本三团体或者直接向中国红十字会总会提出请求的可能，在所提出的要求有了一定的结果的时候，中国红十字会总会将通过日本三团体，告诉有田八郎先生领导的留守家族全国协议会。
    （6）由于中日两国直到今天尚未恢复邦交，中国方面不可能把目前在中国的大约六千名日侨的名单交给日本。但是，如果日本方面提出在中华人民共和国成立以后确实还在中国的日侨的名单，中国方面可以接受下来，并且根据日方提出的确实材料，进行个别调查。根据以上谅解，中国红十字会总会接受了有田八郎先生所交来的有关解放以后在中国的日侨名单。
    三、日本侵略中国战争时期曾经掳去大批中国人到日本强迫劳动，其中许多人被当时的日本政府杀戮或者虐待致于死亡
    中国方面希望有田八郎先生在返回日本之后，设法促使把在日本侵略战争时期在日本死亡的中国人的名单交给中国红十字会总会，因为这是中国在日死难烈士家族所强烈要求的。
          中国人民外交学会
            1957年8月29日
    又讯  新华社记者从中国红十字会总会负责人获悉：自从在1954年同日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络委员会三团体达成关于协助查询在中国的日侨下落的协议以来，中国红十字会收到日本人民通过日本三团体或者来中国访问的日本代表团以及个别直接向中国红十字会请求代为调查曾经在中国居留过的日本人的信件和资料共有四千余件。中国红十字会在可能范围内做了各种努力，就这些请求进行个别调查。第一批已经查到下落的日本人二百八十六名，都已经通知了查询人，并且抄告了日本三团体。现又继续查出五百多人，包括日本侨民三百五十六名，其中已经回国的六十名，死亡的八名；日本战争犯罪分子一百四十二名，其中一百三十六名已经被中国政府宽释，由中国红十字会协助回国。此项调查结果再经详细核对后，将分别通知日本三团体和查询人。
    其余三千余件信件的情况是：
    （1）八一五以前下落不明的日本人，这类情况根本无法调查，应该由日本政府向日本人民作出交代。
    （2）八一五以后蒋介石政府时期下落不明的日本人，这类情况很难调查，但仍在可能范围内，继续进行个别调查。
    （3）对被查询人未提供任何现实调查材料，因而无法调查。
    （4）根据来信所谈，被查询人并不在中国，因而也无法调查。
    （5）同中国人结婚的日本妇女，改用了中国姓名，调查这些人极不容易，需要很多时间。
    此外，最近有田八郎先生交来的有关解放以后相信仍在中国的日侨名单必定会与上述四千余件来信和资料有不少重复，中国红十字会正在进行核对，这项工作也需要相当时间。
    尽管调查工作存在着许多困难，但是中国红十字会仍然愿意尽可能地协助调查。一俟获有结果，就会通知日本三团体并且请他们转告查询人和有田八郎先生领导的留守家族全国协议会。
