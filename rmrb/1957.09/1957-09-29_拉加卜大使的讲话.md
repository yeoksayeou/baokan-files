Ladies and Gentlemen:

    We celebrate the opening of the Egyptian Film Week in China with great pleasure. I am convinced that this film week will further strengthen the cultural exchange between our two peoples.

    More than a year ago, diplomatic relations were established between Egypt and China, and the cultural agreement between the two countries also came into effect. This has made the friendship between our two countries even closer.

    Both Egypt and China are ancient cultural countries in the world. In fact, the relationship between China and Arab countries was established long ago and has been mutually influential. Later, both countries suffered greatly from imperialist oppression, which affected the relationship between Egypt and China.

    But Egypt and China have regained their freedom today. The common sincere desire of the two countries is to cooperate closely in culture and all aspects, so that the people of both countries can live a happy and peaceful life.

    Although the cultural relations between Egypt and China have not been restored for long, they have produced good results. The exchange of professors, students, sports and many other delegations, as well as various cultural and artistic exhibitions between the two countries are becoming increasingly frequent. These activities have greatly promoted mutual understanding between the people of Egypt and China.

    We highly appreciate the efforts of Chinese artists, painters, writers, and other cultural figures. Because they used their outstanding labor to firmly support the Egyptian people, enabling the latter to defeat the imperialist powers in the heroic anti-aggression war last year.

    We are convinced that the anti-Syrian plan that imperialism is plotting in Syria today will suffer the same fate as they did in Egypt last year. This is because the spiritual strength of peace-loving countries all over the world is far greater than any of the destructive weapons of imperialism.

    On behalf of the Egyptian government and people, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and all cultural figures for their outstanding contributions in preparing for the Egyptian Film Week. I hope that the Egyptian Film Week will be successful, and I hope that the cultural relations between Egypt and China will be strengthened and prospered.

    I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai for personally attending the opening ceremony of our film week!

    Long live the friendship between Egypt and China!

### 拉加卜大使的讲话

专栏：

    拉加卜大使的讲话女士们、先生们：
    我们用非常愉快的心情来庆祝在中国举行的埃及电影周开幕。我深信，这个电影周将进一步加强两国人民间的文化交流。
    一年多以前，埃中两国间开始建立了外交关系，而两国间的文化协定也开始生效。这就使得我们两国间的友谊更加密切。
    埃中两国都是世界文化古国。事实上，中国与阿拉伯国家的关系早已建立，并且是互为影响的。后来，两国同样深受帝国主义的压迫，影响了埃中间的关系。
    但是埃中两国在今天已经重获自由。两国共同的真诚愿望是在文化和一切方面紧密的合作，使两国人民都能过幸福、和平的生活。
    虽然埃中两国间的文化关系恢复不久，但是已经产生了很好的效果。两国间互派教授、学生、体育及其他许多代表团以及互相举行文化、艺术等各种展览会正在日益频繁。这些活动已大大地促进了埃中两国人民间的相互了解。
    我们对于中国的艺术家、画家、作家以及其他文化界人士的努力给予极高的评价。因为他们用出色的劳动坚决支持了埃及人民，使后者于去年在英勇的反侵略战争中战胜了帝国主义强国。
    我们深信，帝国主义今天在叙利亚策划的反叙计划一定会遭到他们去年在埃及遭到的同样下场。这是因为全世界爱好和平国家的精神力量要大大强于帝国主义的任何毁灭性的武器。
    我谨代表埃及政府和人民在这里向中国政府、中国人民以及一切文化界人士表示深深的感谢，感谢他们在筹办埃及电影周的工作中的卓越贡献。我希望埃及电影周将获得成功，同时，我更希望埃中两国间的文化关系将日益加强与繁荣。
    我谨向朱德副主席和周恩来总理亲自参加我们电影周开幕式，表示衷心的感谢！
    埃中两国友好万岁！
