	Editorial: On the Current Situation in the Middle East
	While the United States Air Force is rapidly airlifting weapons to Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey, and while the heads of the United States, Britain, and France are secretly consulting on the Middle East issue, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in his statement on September 7, blatantly expressed the United States' intention to intensify its aggression against Syria. All of this is making the situation in the Middle East increasingly tense.
	Since the failure of the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt, the situation in the Middle East has been volatile. The fundamental reason for this situation is that U.S. imperialism is attempting to subvert Egypt and Syria, two countries that adhere to an independent policy of peace and neutrality, in order to realize its ambition of dominating the Middle East. Shortly after the end of the Suez War, the United States instigated a coup in Jordan, overthrowing the nationalist government and attempting to divide the unity of the Arab countries and isolate Egypt and Syria. Subsequently, the United States orchestrated a series of subversive activities in Syria, plotting to gain control over Syria in order to further isolate Egypt. After these conspiracies failed, the United States refused to give up and continued to plan direct military intervention against Syria. While the United States is stepping up its aggression, Britain and France are also making every effort to suppress the national independence movement in the Middle East. Britain brutally suppresses the uprising of the people of Oman, launches attacks on Yemen, and France intensifies its bloody war against the people of Algeria. They are attempting to use these means to maintain their remaining colonial power in the Middle East.
	The current complex and fierce struggle in the Middle East is a continuation of the acute struggle that has unfolded in this region since the end of World War II. For a long time, the Middle East and North Africa have been under colonial rule. Until after World War II, imperialism, fearing the rising tide of the world's national independence movement, was forced to recognize the independence of some countries, but it still did not relax its control in economic, political, and military terms. However, the people of the Middle East demanded genuine independence. Therefore, the increasingly acute struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism since World War II has become the most fundamental factor determining the development of the situation in the Middle East.
	The Bandung Conference was a manifestation of the awakening of Asian and African nations, and it encouraged the continued advancement of the national independence movement in the Asian and African regions. Under the influence and promotion of the Bandung spirit, the national independence movement in West Asia and Africa has developed vigorously. Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana have joined the ranks of independent countries in this region. The heroic resistance of the Algerian people and the armed uprising of the people of Oman are shining with the flames of Arab nationalism. In the increasingly high tide of the anti-colonialist struggle of the Middle Eastern people, Egypt and Syria are playing a particularly important role. Egypt and Syria adhere to the unity between Arab countries, adhere to the ten principles of the Asian-African Conference, adhere to a policy of active peace and neutrality, and adhere to a stance against aggression and colonialism. The development of the Middle East situation since the Asian-African Conference powerfully demonstrates that Egypt and Syria have become the core of Arab nationalism and the mainstay of the anti-colonialist struggle in the Middle East.
	In order to achieve the common goal of eliminating Arab nationalist forces and enslaving the people of Arab countries, and in order to seize spheres of influence in the Middle East so as to realize their imperialist aggressive ambitions, Western colonialists are trying to remove the two thorns in their side, Egypt and Syria. Especially the United States, which, even before the Suez War, exhausted all means to drag these two countries into aggressive military blocs. After the Suez War, the United States pushed forward with the "Eisenhower Doctrine," ambitiously attempting to dominate the Middle East and peer into Africa, and thus even more frantically attacked Egypt and Syria. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" uses anti-communism as a pretext, but one of its actual main purposes is to divide the Arab countries, isolate Egypt and Syria, and defeat them one by one, in order to suppress the national independence movement in the Middle East and turn the Middle East into a colony for the United States to arbitrarily plunder. This has formed a sharp and complex struggle, time and time again, between the Middle Eastern anti-colonialist forces represented by Egypt and Syria and the colonialist forces represented by the United States. This struggle has recently been particularly sharply manifested in the intensified U.S. conspiracy to subvert and invade Syria, thus greatly exacerbating the tense situation in the Middle East.
	The US aggression in the Middle East and the struggle of the Middle Eastern peoples to win and maintain independence are important components of the struggle between the forces of war and the forces of peace. The reason why the United States is painstakingly trying to control the Middle East is not only to turn the Middle East into its colony, but also to use the Middle East to prepare for new aggression. After World War II, in addition to socialist countries and imperialist countries, a series of nationalist countries emerged in the world. The vast majority of these countries are pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality, forming a huge force for peace, which has created enormous difficulties for the imperialist policy of expanding aggression. In order to smoothly implement its aggressive policy, the United States regards the nationalist countries in the Middle East region that adhere to peace and neutrality, and the national independence movement in this region, as the primary objects it must suppress and eliminate. Because the Middle East region has important significance in the US aggression plan.
	From a geographical point of view, the Middle East is the link between Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is the main transportation line for imperialism to enter and exit the three continents and carry out colonial aggression. If imperialism controls the Middle East, it can guarantee its colonial control over Asia and Africa and maintain the collapsing colonial system. Conversely, if the people of the Middle East achieve independence, imperialism will not only be unable to continue to maintain its remaining colonies in Asia, but even Africa will not be able to keep. The national independence movements of the people of Latin America will also rise. Therefore, it is completely clear that the United States regards the Middle East as a key region for establishing its world colonial empire.
	The Middle East not only has an important strategic position geographically, but also has abundant strategic resources. The reserves of Middle Eastern oil are estimated to be two-thirds of the oil reserves in the capitalist world, and new oil fields are constantly being discovered. According to Western estimates, by 1975, Middle Eastern oil production will account for about half of the total oil production in the capitalist world. Imperialism controls almost all of the Middle East's oil resources and oil production. They not only obtain astonishing profits from plundering oil resources and exploiting local labor, but also use these resources to suppress the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people and prepare for war.
	Before World War II, the Middle East was mainly a British and French colony. The Middle East's oil resources were basically controlled by Britain. After World War II, the United States actively invaded the Middle East under the banner of the "Truman Doctrine" and seized the positions of Britain and France. The United States first focused on seizing the strategic material, oil. From before the war to 1956, the share of Middle Eastern oil reserves controlled by the United States had increased from 17% to 55%, while Britain's had shrunk from 76% to 35%. The United States vigorously seized Middle Eastern oil, not only to seize huge profits, but also to manipulate Western European countries by controlling the oil necessary for the Western European economy, forcing them to follow the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war. As the pace of US war preparations accelerated, the United States also gradually expanded the scope of US aggressive activities by planning aggressive military blocs in the Middle East, establishing military bases in the Middle East, and militarily controlling the Middle East. After the end of the Suez War, the United States believed that this was a great opportunity to expand into the Middle East and Africa, so it proposed the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to "fill the vacuum," openly wanting to replace the position of Britain and France. The United States has further strengthened its control over the Baghdad Pact group, and has dragged Jordan and Lebanon into the aggressive system of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." US forces are also infiltrating the Persian Gulf and the whole of Africa. The increasingly fierce struggle between imperialist countries for control of the Middle East has made the Middle East region the center of contradictions among the current imperialist groups.
	The US seizure of the Middle East is an extremely serious struggle within the imperialist group. Due to the weakening of their own strength and their dependence on the United States after World War II, Britain and France had to make considerable concessions to the United States in the Middle East region, which they regarded as a forbidden territory. After the Suez Canal incident, the positions of Britain and France were further severely hit, but they did not give up their fierce resistance to the aggressive US forces. Facts have proved that they are still desperately trying to maintain their remaining colonial interests and so-called great power status. Although the British and French military adventure against Egypt has failed shamefully, Britain brazenly suppressed the armed uprising of the Omani people despite condemnation from international public opinion, and France is continuing its dirty war against the Algerian people. They are trying to build a defense line in the Persian Gulf and North Africa to stop the "Eisenhower Doctrine" from advancing. This internal struggle within the imperialist group, with its intrigues and life-and-death competition, increases the complexity and acuteness of the Middle East situation.
	Many signs have shown that if the United States succeeds in Syria and Egypt, the interests of Britain and France in the Middle East and Africa are what the United States will reach out to seize next. The authorities in Britain and France should now realize that the national independence movement in the Middle East, like the national independence movements in the Far East and Southeast Asia, is an irresistible historical torrent. Only by immediately stopping the aggression and suppression of the Middle Eastern people, ending colonial rule, and respecting the aspirations of the Middle Eastern people and the sovereignty and independence of the Middle Eastern countries, can Britain and France establish equal and mutually beneficial friendly relations with the Middle Eastern countries.
	In the US imperialist aggression plan, the Middle East region also has special military significance. The Middle East region is close to the southern edge of the socialist camp. Imperialism, headed by the United States, has been trying to turn this area into a base for aggression, so that it can directly attack the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries from here. In the US strategic plan, the Middle East North layer region is part of the military base network surrounding the socialist camp. The Baghdad Pact group planned by the United States is linked to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization through Turkey in the west and Pakistan in the east, forming an encirclement of the socialist camp. It is obvious that after the Middle Eastern people have achieved the victory of the national independence movement, they will never allow imperialism to use their country as a base for aggression. This disrupts the entire US war deployment.
	It can be seen from this that the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people is part of the struggle between the forces of war and the forces of peace worldwide. One of the main goals of the United States in promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East is to eliminate the nationally independent countries in the Middle East, change their policy of peace and neutrality, turn them into a part of the US colonial empire, and force them to serve the US policy of creating tension and preparing for new wars. The national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people is an important component of the forces of peace that safeguard world peace. The victory of the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people will deal a severe blow to the aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism.
	Because of this, the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people has received the support of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. In contrast to the imperialist countries headed by the United States, socialist countries have always resolutely strived to ease international tensions, eliminate the threat of war, and expand the area of peace. Socialist countries regard assisting people who have been subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression and supporting their national independence movement as their own responsibility, and as an important step in maintaining world peace. Therefore, socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have consistently sympathized with the anti-colonialist struggle of the Middle Eastern people and given them active support. During the British and French aggression against Egypt, and later when the United States imposed various pressures on Egypt and Syria, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with peace-loving people all over the world, gave all-out support to Egypt and Syria. The recent economic agreement between the Soviet government and Syria, and the condemnation of the US, British, and French conspiracy to launch an aggression against Syria, and the suggestion that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France jointly declare that they will not use force in the Middle East, are great and just assistance to Syria. There is no doubt that Egypt, Syria, and the Middle Eastern people will continue to receive multifaceted support from socialist countries in their future anti-colonialist struggle.
	Of course, it should also be seen that the struggle of the Middle Eastern people is still complex and arduous. Because imperialism adopts vicious policies of provoking discord and divide and conquer, two different paths have appeared in the Middle Eastern countries. One path is represented by Egypt and Syria, which adhere to a policy of peace and neutrality and do not participate in military blocs. They resolutely oppose imperialist aggression, defend their sovereignty and independence, and maintain friendly relations with all countries. By implementing this policy, Egypt and Syria have made great contributions to maintaining peace in the world and the Middle East, and have been admired and supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and have received the support and support of all peace-loving countries, especially socialist countries. Their international status and prestige are increasing day by day, and they have more and more reliable friends. Their strength has been strengthened, their domestic unity has been increasingly consolidated, and their economy can also develop steadily. They are not only fighting for their own independence, but also fighting for the independence of the entire Arab world. The path taken by Egypt and Syria is in line with the interests of the people of these two countries, and also in line with the interests of peace in the Middle East and the world. This is the correct path.
	The other path is a path that violates national interests and harms the interests of peace. The ruling groups of some Middle Eastern countries follow the war policies of imperialism, accept the Eisenhower Doctrine, and provide military bases and war cannon fodder for the United States. They make their countries subject to foreign manipulation and control in politics, economy, and military affairs. The result of their doing so will not only increase the burden on their own people and make their lives miserable, but will also cause Arab brotherly countries to fall into a state of mutual suspicion and division, giving Western colonialists, especially the United States, an opportunity to attack Arab nationalism. However, there is no doubt that in today's Middle East, where the people's awareness is increasing day by day, this path of following imperialism is definitely not sustainable, because it is neither in line with the interests of the people of their own country, nor in line with the interests of peace in the Middle East and the world. Taking chestnuts out of the fire for imperialism will not get you anything except burning your own claws.
	On the road of the Middle Eastern people striving for and defending national independence, although there are still many difficulties and obstacles, their future is bright; in the sky over the Middle East region, although there are still dark clouds, the sun will eventually break through the dark clouds and shine on the land of the Middle East. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, Egypt, Syria, and the entire Middle Eastern people, as long as they remain vigilant, persist in the struggle, and strengthen internal and mutual solidarity among all nationalities under the banner of anti-colonialism, they will surely be able to overcome difficulties, defeat all the insidious means of the aggressors, and make the Middle East a world where the people of the Middle East are masters of their own affairs.

    论当前的中东局势
    当美国空军正在急速空运武器到约旦、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、土耳其的时候，当美英法首脑正在对中东问题进行秘密会商的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯在9月7日的声明中又露骨地表示了美国加紧对叙利亚进行侵略的意图。这一切就使中东的局势日趋紧张。
    从英、法、以色列侵略埃及失败以来，中东地区的局势，一直动荡不定。造成这种情况的根本原因，就是美帝国主义企图颠覆埃及和叙利亚这两个坚持独立的和平中立的国家，实现它称霸中东的野心。在苏伊士战争结束以后不久，美国就在约旦制造政变，推翻了约旦的民族主义政府，企图分化阿拉伯国家的团结，孤立埃及和叙利亚。接着，美国又在叙利亚策动了一系列的颠覆活动，阴谋取得对叙利亚的控制，以达到它进一步孤立埃及的目的。在这些阴谋失败以后，美国仍然不肯干休，继续策划对叙利亚进行直接的军事干涉。在美国加紧侵略的同时，英国和法国也竭力镇压中东的民族独立运动。英国残暴地镇压阿曼人民的起义，对也门发动进攻，法国加紧对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥战争。它们企图用这种手段来维持自己在中东残余的殖民势力。
    目前中东这种复杂和激烈斗争的局面，是第二次世界大战结束以后在这一地区展开的尖锐的斗争的继续。长期以来，中东和北非地区一直处在殖民统治之下。直到二次大战以后，帝国主义慑于世界民族独立运动的高涨，被迫承认了一些国家的独立，而在经济、政治和军事上仍然不放松自己的控制。但是中东人民却要求取得真正的独立。因此，二次大战以来，殖民主义和反殖民主义力量进行着的日益尖锐的斗争，便成为决定中东局势发展的最根本的因素。
    万隆会议是亚非民族觉醒的表现，它鼓舞了亚非地区民族独立运动的继续前进。在万隆精神的影响和推动下，西亚和非洲地区的民族独立运动有了蓬勃的发展。苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯和加纳参加了这个地区的独立国家的行列。阿尔及利亚人民的英勇抗战和阿曼人民的武装起义，闪耀着阿拉伯民族主义的火焰。而在中东人民日益高涨的反殖民主义斗争中，埃及和叙利亚起着特别重要的作用。埃及和叙利亚坚持阿拉伯各国之间的团结，坚持亚非会议的十项原则，坚持积极的和平中立政策，坚持反侵略、反殖民主义的立场。亚非会议以来中东形势的发展有力地表明：埃及和叙利亚已经成为阿拉伯民族主义的核心，成为中东反殖民主义斗争的中坚力量。
    为了达到消灭阿拉伯民族主义力量和奴役阿拉伯各国人民这个共同目的，为了夺取中东的势力范围，以便实现自己的帝国主义侵略野心，西方殖民主义者力图拔去埃及和叙利亚这两个眼中钉。特别是美国，它在苏伊士战争以前，就用尽各种办法要把这两个国家拉进侵略性的军事集团。苏伊士战争以后，美国推行了“艾森豪威尔主义”，野心勃勃地企图独霸中东，进窥非洲，于是就更加疯狂地向埃及、叙利亚进攻。“艾森豪威尔主义”以反共为借口，但是实际上的主要目的之一，就是要分化阿拉伯国家，孤立埃及和叙利亚并且加以各个击破，以镇压中东的民族独立运动，把中东变成美国任意宰割的殖民地。这样就形成了以埃及、叙利亚为代表的中东反殖民主义力量同以美国为代表的殖民主义势力之间，一次又一次的尖锐而又复杂的斗争。这一斗争最近特别尖锐地表现在美国加紧进行颠覆和侵略叙利亚的阴谋活动上，因而大大地加剧了中东的紧张局势。
    美国侵略中东和中东人民争取和维护独立的斗争，是战争力量同和平力量之间的斗争的重要组成部分。美国之所以处心积虑地要控制中东，不仅是为了要把中东变成它的殖民地，而且企图利用中东来准备新的侵略。在二次大战以后，世界上除了社会主义国家和帝国主义国家以外，还出现了一系列的民族主义国家。这些国家绝大多数都在执行着和平中立的政策，形成了一支巨大的和平力量，给帝国主义扩大侵略的政策造成了巨大的困难。美国为了顺利推行它的侵略政策，就把中东地区坚持和平中立的民族主义国家和这个地区的民族独立运动，作为它首先要加以镇压和消灭的对象。因为在美国的侵略计划中，中东地区具有重要的意义。
    从地理位置上来看，中东是欧、亚、非三洲的联结点，是帝国主义进出三大洲、进行殖民侵略的主要交通线。帝国主义控制着中东，就可以保证它对亚洲和非洲的殖民地控制，维系崩溃中的殖民体系。反过来说，中东人民如果取得了独立，帝国主义不但不可能继续保持在亚洲的残存的殖民地，而且连非洲也将保不住。影响所及，拉丁美洲人民的民族独立运动也将高涨。因此，美国把中东看成是建立它的世界殖民帝国的关键地区，是完全清楚的事。
    中东不但在地理上具有重要的战略地位，而且有丰富的战略资源。中东石油的蕴藏量，估计为资本主义世界石油蕴藏量的三分之二，而且新的油矿还在不断发现。据西方估计，到1975年，中东石油生产量将为整个资本主义世界石油生产量的一半左右。帝国主义控制了几乎全部中东的石油资源和石油生产。它们不但从掠夺石油资源和剥削当地的劳动力中取得了惊人的利润，而且利用这些资源来镇压中东人民的民族独立运动和准备战争。
    在二次大战以前，中东主要是英法的殖民地。中东的石油资源，基本上控制在英国手里。二次大战以后，美国就在“杜鲁门主义”的旗帜下积极侵入中东，夺取英国和法国的阵地。美国首先着眼在夺取战略物资石油上面。从战前到1956年，中东石油储藏量中美国控制的份额，已经由17％增加到55％，而英国则由76％缩减到35％。美国大力夺取中东石油，不但是为了攫取巨额利润，而且也是为了通过控制为西欧经济所必需的石油来操纵西欧国家，迫使它们跟着美国扩军备战。随着美国备战步调的加速，美国又通过策划中东地区的侵略性军事集团，在中东建立军事基地，从军事上控制中东，逐步扩大美国侵略活动的范围。在苏伊士战争结束以后，美国认为这是向中东和非洲扩张的大好机会，因此提出了“填补真空”的“艾森豪威尔主义”，公开地要取代英、法的地位。美国进一步加强了对巴格达条约集团的控制，把约旦和黎巴嫩拉进“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略体系。美国势力还正向波斯湾和整个非洲渗入。帝国主义国家为争夺对中东的控制权而进行的越来越激烈的斗争，使得中东地区成为当前帝国主义集团矛盾的中心。
    美国夺取中东，是帝国主义集团内部的一场极其严重的斗争。英、法在二次大战后由于本身力量的削弱和对美国的依赖，不得不在视若禁脔的中东地区对美国作了相当的让步。苏伊士运河事件之后，英法的地位进一步受到了沉重的打击，但是并没有放弃对咄咄逼人的美国势力进行猛烈的抗拒。事实证明，它们仍然在拚命设法维护它们残剩的殖民利益和所谓大国地位。英法对埃及的军事冒险虽然已经可耻地失败了，但是英国不顾国际舆论的谴责，悍然镇压阿曼人民的武装起义，法国也在继续进行对阿尔及利亚人民的肮脏战争。它们企图在波斯湾和北非筑一道防线，阻止“艾森豪威尔主义”前进。帝国主义集团内部这种勾心斗角、你死我活的斗争，增加了中东局势的复杂性和尖锐性。
    许多迹象已经表明，如果美国在叙利亚和埃及得手，英国和法国在中东和非洲的利益，就是美国下一步要伸手夺取的东西。英国和法国的当局现在应该认识到，中东的民族独立运动就像远东和东南亚地区的民族独立运动一样，是一股不可抵挡的历史巨流。英国和法国只有立即停止对中东人民的侵略和镇压，结束殖民统治，尊重中东人民的愿望和中东国家的主权和独立，才能同中东各国建立平等互利的友好关系。
    在美帝国主义的侵略计划中，中东地区还有军事上的特殊意义。中东地区紧靠着社会主义阵营的南缘。以美国为首的帝国主义，一直企图把这一片地区变成侵略基地，以便从这里直接进攻苏联和东欧人民民主国家。在美国的战略计划中，中东北层地区是包围社会主义阵营的军事基地网的一个组成部分。美国所策划的巴格达条约集团，通过西边的土耳其和东边的巴基斯坦，同北大西洋公约集团和东南亚条约集团联系在一起，构成了对社会主义阵营的包围圈。很明显，中东人民取得了民族独立运动的胜利以后，将决不容许帝国主义把他们的国家当作侵略基地。这样就打乱了美国的整个战争部署。
    由此可见，中东人民的民族独立运动，是世界范围内的战争势力同和平力量的斗争的一部分。美国在中东推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的主要目的之一，就是要消灭中东的民族独立的国家，改变它们的和平中立政策，把它们变成美国殖民帝国的一部分，迫使它们为美国的制造紧张局势和准备新战争的政策服务。而中东人民的民族独立运动，则是全世界维护和平、制止战争的力量的一个重要组成部分。中东人民民族独立运动的胜利，将给美帝国主义的侵略阴谋以严重的打击。
    正因为这样，中东人民的民族独立运动得到了全世界爱好和平的人民的支持，特别得到了以苏联为首的社会主义国家的支持。同以美国为首的帝国主义国家相反，社会主义国家一贯坚决地为和缓国际紧张局势、消除战争威胁、扩大和平地区而努力。社会主义国家把援助遭受帝国主义侵略和压迫的人民、支持他们的民族独立运动看作是自己的一种责任，而且是维护世界和平的重要步骤。因此，以苏联为首的社会主义国家一贯同情中东人民的反殖民主义斗争，并且给予他们以积极的支持。在英、法侵略埃及期间，以及后来美国对埃及、叙利亚施加各方面压力的时候，苏联以及其他社会主义国家都曾经同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，给埃及和叙利亚以全力的支援。苏联政府最近同叙利亚订立了经济协定，并且谴责美英法三国阴谋发动对叙利亚的侵略，建议苏美英法四国共同声明不在中东使用武力，是对于叙利亚的伟大的正义的援助。毫无疑问，埃及、叙利亚和中东人民在他们今后的反殖民主义的斗争中，将继续得到社会主义国家的多方面的支持。
    当然，也应当看到，中东人民的斗争仍然是复杂而且艰苦的。由于帝国主义采取挑拨离间、分而治之的恶毒政策，在中东国家中出现了两条不同的道路。一条道路以埃及和叙利亚为代表，它们坚持和平中立政策，不参加军事集团。它们坚决反对帝国主义的侵略，保卫自己的主权和独立，同一切国家保持友好的关系。由于执行了这个政策，埃及和叙利亚对维护世界和中东地区的和平作出了巨大的贡献，受到了全世界爱好和平的人民的钦佩和支持，得到了所有爱好和平的国家，尤其是社会主义国家的声援和支持。它们在国际上的地位和声望日益提高，有了越来越多的可以信赖的朋友。它们的力量加强了，国内的团结日益巩固了，经济方面也可以稳步发展。它们不但是在为本国的独立而斗争，也是在为整个阿拉伯世界的独立而斗争。埃及和叙利亚所走的道路，符合于这两个国家人民的利益，也符合于中东和世界和平的利益。这是一条正确的道路。
    另一条道路是违反民族利益和危害和平利益的道路。有些中东国家的统治集团追随帝国主义的战争政策，接受艾森豪威尔主义，给美国提供军事基地和战争炮灰。它们使自己的国家在政治、经济、军事各方面都受到外国的操纵和控制。它们这样做的结果，不仅将加重本国人民的负担，使他们生活痛苦不堪，并且将使阿拉伯兄弟国家之间陷于互相猜忌和分裂的状态，给西方殖民主义者特别是美国以进攻阿拉伯民族主义的机会。但是，毫无疑问的，在中东人民觉悟日益提高的今天，这条追随帝国主义的道路是肯定走不长的，因为它既不符合本国人民的利益，也不符合中东和世界和平的利益。为帝国主义火中取栗，除了烧掉自己的脚爪以外，是不可能得到任何东西的。
    在中东人民争取和保卫民族独立的道路上，虽然还存在着许多困难和障碍，但是他们的前途是光明的；在中东地区的天空，虽然还有乌云，但是阳光终将冲破乌云普照中东的大地。受全世界爱好和平的人民支持的埃及、叙利亚和整个中东人民，只要保持警惕，坚持斗争，并在反殖民主义的旗帜下加强各民族的内部团结和相互团结，他们必能克服困难，战胜侵略者的一切毒辣手段，使中东成为中东人民自己当家作主的天下。
