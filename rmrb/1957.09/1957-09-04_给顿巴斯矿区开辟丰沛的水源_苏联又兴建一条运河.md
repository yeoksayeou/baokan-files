Xinhua News Agency, Kharkov, September 3rd: According to a TASS report from Kharkov, the Soviet Union is currently building the North Donets-Donbas Canal, a 125-kilometer-long waterway in Donbas, one of its well-known industrial centers. The construction of this canal is of great significance for the development of Donbas, which is rich in mineral resources but lacks water sources.

This canal will run from the North Donets River in the Kharkov region all the way to Donbas. It is as long as the Moscow Canal and 24 kilometers longer than the Volga-Don Canal, which opened to navigation in July 1952. After the completion of this canal, water channels with a total length of more than 200 kilometers will extend from the canal to various industrial areas, in order to fully guarantee the industrial and residential water supply for the cities and workers' districts here.

The water dam of the North Donets-Donbas Canal is built near the village of Raigorod on the North Donets River. The water flow of this dam is 25 cubic meters per second. In order to ensure a constant flow of water in the canal throughout the year, a large reservoir is being built near the village of Red Oskol on the Oskol River, a tributary of the North Donets River. The dam being built here will deepen the river water by 12 meters and store 550 million cubic meters of water. A 112-kilometer section of the Oskol River will also be navigable. A hydroelectric power station with a generating capacity of 3,140 kilowatts is also under construction here.

This canal is not entirely above ground. In places with railways, valleys, and mining areas, it flows through underground steel and concrete pipes.

The builders of this canal have decided to start releasing water before the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    给顿巴斯矿区开辟丰沛的水源
    苏联又兴建一条运河
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社哈尔科夫讯：目前苏联正在著名的工业中心之一顿巴斯建设一条长一百二十五公里的北顿涅茨—顿巴斯运河。这条运河的兴建对开发矿藏丰富、但是缺乏水源的顿巴斯来说具有重大的意义。
    这条运河将从哈尔科夫州的北顿涅茨河一直通到顿巴斯。它和莫斯科运河一样长，而比1952年7月开始通航的伏尔加河—顿河运河长二十四公里。这条运河竣工以后，总长度在二百公里以上的水渠将从运河通向各工业区，以便充分保证这里的各个城市和工人区的工业和居民用水。
    北顿涅茨—顿巴斯运河的拦水坝建筑在北顿涅茨河上的拉伊戈罗村附近。这个拦水坝的流水量每秒钟为二十五立方公尺。为了使运河的水流终年不断，正在北顿涅茨河的支流奥斯科尔河上的红色奥斯科尔村附近建筑一个大水库。在这里建筑的堤坝将使河水加深十二公尺，并且积蓄五亿五千万立方公尺的水。而奥斯科尔河也将有一百一十二公里的一段河道可以通航。这里还在建筑一个水电站，它的发电能力为三千一百四十瓩。
    这条运河不是全部都在地面上的。在有着铁道、山谷和矿区的地方，它就通过地底下的钢管和混凝土管流过去。
    这条运河的建设者们决定在十月革命四十周年纪念日前夕开始放水。
