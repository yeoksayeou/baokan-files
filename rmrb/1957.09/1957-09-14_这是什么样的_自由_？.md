Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Cadres and residents of Luozhou Town, Minhou County, Fujian Province, jointly consulted and proposed to reduce grain sales by more than 14,000 catties from now until the end of the year.

Luozhou Town has more than 400 households of fruit farmers, fishermen, handicraft workers, small vendors, and other non-agricultural people, who need more than 439,000 catties of grain supplied by the state every year. Recently, when the town carried out propaganda on saving grain, it was supported by most residents. However, some people believed that free trading of grain like before liberation, although people ate expensive rice, was much more "free" than implementing unified sales. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, a great debate began.

At the debate, many people used their own experiences to refute the fallacy that "free grain trading is better than unified purchase and sales." Small vendor Wu Xuekai said, "What's good about free grain trading? Before liberation, the price of grain rose every day. Landlords hoarded large quantities of grain until it rotted, and the owner of Xinfeng Rice Store in this town hoarded more than 100 dan of grain and raised the price without selling; while my whole family couldn't even drink rice soup and was forced to sell a pair of children. After liberation, the implementation of unified grain sales stabilized grain prices and guaranteed supply, so that I, as a small vendor, could also support my family." Woman Zheng Zuwen said, "Before liberation, free grain trading made profiteers rich and poor people starve to death. In the disaster year of 1944, more than 100 people starved to death in the town, and more than 100 people sold their children. What kind of 'freedom' is this? Now the state implements unified purchase and sales of grain, guarantees urban and rural supplies, and stabilizes market prices, so that everyone has food to eat, and no one starves to death. This is the greatest freedom for the vast majority of people."

At this time, although everyone affirmed the benefits of unified grain sales, some people still said that the current grain supply standard is already very low, it can only be increased, not reduced, and it is impossible to save any more. Therefore, another debate was triggered. Several residents of the Dacheng residential area pointed out at the meeting that when full today, we must remember the hunger of the past. Before liberation, one person could not eat even 20 catties of rice a month, and now everyone generally has been raised to 28 to 30 catties. They believe that this standard is not low and should not be raised any higher. Handicraft worker Lin Wenting said, "Farmers produce grain, every grain of rice, every drop of sweat. They are still selling more surplus grain to the state, and we should be more frugal."

　　这是什么样的“自由”？
    新华社讯  福建省闽侯县螺洲镇干部和居民共同协商，提出从现在起到年底止降低粮食销量一万四千多斤。
    螺洲镇共有四百多户果农、渔民、手工业者、小商贩及其他非农业人口，每年要由国家供应粮食四十三万九千多斤。最近镇上开展节约粮食宣传时，得到了大部分居民的拥护。但是也有一些人认为，解放前那样自由买卖粮食，人们虽然吃贵米，却比实行统销“自由”得多。因此，在党的领导下，开始了一场大辩论。
    辩论会上，许多人用亲身经历的事实，驳斥了“粮食自由买卖比统购统销好”的谬论。小贩吴学开说：“自由买卖粮食有什么好？解放前有一年，粮价天天涨，地主家里大批囤粮霉烂，本镇信丰米店老板囤粮一百多担抬价不卖；而我全家连米汤都喝不上，被迫卖掉了一对儿女。解放后实行粮食统销，粮价稳定，保证供应，我做小贩也能维持一家人吃饭。”妇女郑祖文说：“解放前粮食自由买卖，奸商发财，穷人饿死。1944年灾年，全镇饿死一百多人，卖掉儿女的也有一百多人，这是什么‘自由’？现在国家实行粮食统购统销，保证城乡供应，稳定市场物价，使人人有饭吃，没有饿死一个人，这才是绝大多数人的最大自由。”
    这时，大家虽然肯定了粮食统销的好处，但是还有人说现在粮食供应标准已经很低，只能增加，不能减少，没有可能再节约了。因此，又引起了一场辩论。大埕居民区的几个居民在会上指出，今日饱，要记往日饿。解放前一个月一人吃不到二十斤米，现在每人一般都提高到二十八斤到三十斤。他们认为，这个标准已经不低了，不应该再提出过高要求。手工业者林文廷说：“农民生产粮食，一粒米，一滴汗。他们还在多卖余粮给国家，我们更要省吃俭用。”
