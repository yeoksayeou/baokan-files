Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 24th: Jakarta newspapers and political figures have recently paid close attention to the demand made by the "Islamic Elders' Congress" in Palembang, South Sumatra, to ban the Indonesian Communist Party.

    Today's "Youth Daily" believes that the resolution passed by this conference, instigated by the Masjumi Party, is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution. The conference attempts to deprive legal organizations protected by the constitution of their right to exist. The newspaper said that this is a manifestation of the climax of activities attempting to change the structure of the state.

    The "Islamic Elders' Congress" was held in Palembang on September 8th. The congress passed a resolution demanding that President Sukarno order a ban on the legal activities of the Indonesian Communist Party, prohibit Muslims from marrying members of the Indonesian Communist Party, require Muslims to withdraw from the Indonesian Communist Party and its affiliated mass organizations, and prohibit communists from participating in the government, etc.

    Islamic religious parties such as the Islamic Teachers' Union and the Islamic League Party did not participate in this congress.

    One of the instigators of this conference, Masjumi Party figure Isa Ansari, said in Jakarta on the 23rd that the purpose of the conference resolution was to "launch a holy war" against communist ideology.

    Indonesian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Lukman told reporters from the Indonesian National News Agency on the 23rd that the Masjumi Party, having failed in its anti-communist activities in the "Anti-Communist Front," wants to use religion and Islamic elders to serve its political interests.

    Lukman is concerned that this will cause unrest in local areas. He said that Indonesian Communist Party members of parliament are collecting relevant materials on this issue and preparing to submit them to the parliament. The Indonesian Communist Party delegation will also send a delegation to discuss this issue with the central government.

    The National News Agency said that the Chairman of the Nationalist Party, Suwiryo, and the Chairman of the Christian Party, Leimena, are unwilling to comment on this matter.

    马斯友美党人策动宗教团体
    叫嚷取缔印度尼西亚共产党
    新华社雅加达24日电　雅加达的报纸和政界人士最近很注意南苏门答腊巨港“伊斯兰教长老代表大会”提出的关于取缔印度尼西亚共产党的要求。
    今天的“青年报”认为，这个由马斯友美党策动召开的会议所通过的决议，是不符合宪法规定的。会议企图剥夺为宪法所保护的合法团体的生存权利。报纸说，这是企图改变国家结构的活动达到高潮的一种表现。
    “伊斯兰教长老代表大会”是9月8日在巨港举行的。这个大会通过决议要求苏加诺总统下令禁止印度尼西亚共产党的合法活动，不准伊斯兰教徒和印度尼西亚共产党员通婚，要伊斯兰教徒退出印度尼西亚共产党和它所领导的群众组织，不允许共产主义者参加政府等。
    伊斯兰教师联合会和伊斯兰联盟党等伊斯兰教政党没有参加这个大会。
    这个会议的策动者马斯友美党要人伊沙·安沙里23日在雅加达说，大会决议的目的是要对共产主义思想“发动圣战”。
    印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼23日对印度尼西亚民族通讯社记者说，马斯友美党由于在“反共阵线”中的反共活动遭到失败，就想利用宗教和伊斯兰教长老来为它的政治利益服务。
    鲁克曼耽心地方上会因此发生骚乱。他说，印度尼西亚共产党国会议员正在搜集有关这个问题的材料，准备向国会提出。印度尼西亚共产党议员团也将派遣代表团同中央政府商量这个问题。
    民族通讯社说，国民党总主席苏维约和基督教党主席莱梅纳不愿意对这件事发表意见。
