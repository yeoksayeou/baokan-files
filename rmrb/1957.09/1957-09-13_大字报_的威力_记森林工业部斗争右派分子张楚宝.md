The Power of "Big-Character Posters"
　　——An Account of the Struggle Against Rightist Zhang Chubao of the Ministry of Forest Industries
　　By Our Correspondent　Liu Shiping
    Walking into the Ministry of Forest Industries, one can see all kinds of big-character posters everywhere. These posters use concrete facts and fully powerful reasoning to expose and criticize a rightist named Zhang Chubao.
    Zhang Chubao was the Deputy Director of the Forest Products Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Forest Industries and the Chairman of the September 3rd Society Branch of the two Ministries of Forestry and Forest Industries. During the period of great blooming and contending, under the guise of helping the Communist Party rectify its work style, he published many anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist fallacies. He slandered that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement violated the Constitution." He everywhere roped in those who had been investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, inciting them to attack the Party.
    When the anti-rightist struggle began, and all the staff and workers of the Ministry of Forest Industries concentrated their firepower to counterattack the right-wing group headed by Minister Luo Longji, including Zhao Wenbi, Zhang Chubao not only did not honestly examine his reactionary words and deeds, but instead played various tricks in an attempt to muddle through and resist reform. Just by looking at the tricks he played, one can see how cunning and insidious this rightist Zhang Chubao was.
    As early as the initial stage of the anti-rightist campaign, Yang Chengji, a technician from the Forest Products Industry Bureau, wrote a big-character poster entitled "Zhao Wenbi's Insidious Attempt," which mentioned that Zhang Chubao had notified Yang Chengji to attend a meeting convened by Zhao Wenbi to attack the Party. Zhang Chubao discovered this big-character poster before Yang Chengji had even posted it. Zhang Chubao, feeling guilty, did not face the facts, examine his own mistakes, and expose Zhao Wenbi's reactionary words and deeds; instead, he questioned Yang Chengji sternly: "Who are you exposing?" This cunning rightist threatened Yang Chengji, saying that during the period of great blooming and contending, Zhao Wenbi wanted to find the democratic parties of the Ministry of Forest Industries to secretly conspire to take joint action and attack the Party. Although you did not agree, you did not object either. He also asked Yang Chengji to revise the big-character poster and not mention the process of Zhang Chubao notifying him to attend the meeting convened by Zhao Wenbi.
    Yang Chengji was not threatened by him. He affirmed that Zhang Chubao notified him to go to Zhao Wenbi's office to discuss the joint action of the democratic parties, and that Qiu Zhizhong and others were also present at the time. They were all key rightists of the Ministry of Forest Industries. Therefore, Yang Chengji only made some modifications to certain wording in the big-character poster and still posted it.
    After seeing the big-character poster, Zhang Chubao was active everywhere, trying to exonerate himself. According to reports, he once said to relevant people: "The bureau's approach is not right. The problems are not discussed in the bureau, but are taken out at every turn." But no one listened to his nonsense. Then someone posted another big-character poster, questioning: "Why is Zhang Chubao doing this?"
    Zhang Chubao not only did not answer this question head-on, but instead secretly worked to tear down the big-character poster. But his conspiracies were all exposed one by one and failed.
    Soon, the comrades from the Forestry Management Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry (Zhang Chubao had served as Deputy Director of the Forestry Management Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry before being transferred to the Ministry of Forest Industries), who worked in the same courtyard as the Ministry of Forest Industries, lined up Zhang Chubao's reactionary arguments and refuted them one by one in big-character posters. For example, Zhang Chubao's most vicious fallacy was saying that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries violates the Constitution." Everyone explained, based on the specific situation of their unit, that Zhang Chubao was talking utter nonsense. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Management Bureau had nine targets. Among them, two were clearly identified as counter-revolutionaries and had already been arrested and sentenced according to their crimes. The other six people were also given conclusions based on the different circumstances of their problems. Only one person's problem has not been concluded because the investigation involves many aspects. Gao Jinglun, who had been investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, used his own personal experience to explain that through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, his historical problems were clarified, allowing him to unload his historical burden, and the Party trusted him even more. He himself also felt relaxed and happy. Gao Jinglun also exposed that Zhang Chubao had incited and fanned the flames to him during the rectification opportunity.
    A great debate was also launched on the big-character posters about Zhang Chubao's shielding of the counter-revolutionary Zeng Qinghe. Zeng Qinghe was a local tyrant and a landlord, a consistently anti-Communist counter-revolutionary. After liberation, he sneaked into the Ministry of Forest Industries. Only during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was he investigated, arrested, and sentenced according to law.
    In the face of the facts, Zhang Chubao saw that the situation was not good and quickly produced a fake self-criticism big-character poster, saying that his so-called reactionary view that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries violates the Constitution" was influenced by listening to the speech of the rightist Gu Zhizhong at the grassroots report meeting of the Beijing Branch of the September 3rd Society. He also went to the rectification office to play rogue, asking to revise his original words, saying that he was "echoing others" and that it was a mistake in the record. After verification, the facts were more eloquent than words. There was not a single mistake in the words written on white paper, but rather he had deliberately framed.
    Rightists are most afraid of presenting facts. When ironclad facts are presented, no matter how one quibbles, one cannot escape. But Zhang Chubao, this insidious rightist, is very cunning. At that time, he took the opportunity to go to Shanghai to avoid being caught. But during his business trip, the staff of the two Ministries of Forest Industries and Forestry did not relax their struggle against him, and continued to use various forms of big-character posters to expose and criticize his reactionary arguments.
    Zhang Chubao originally thought that by going on a business trip for twenty days and hiding from the storm, the matter would pass. Unexpectedly, after returning, big-character posters criticizing and refuting his reactionary remarks were posted one after another, demanding that he lower his head, confess his guilt, and make a thorough explanation.
    At this time, Zhang Chubao still wanted to pretend to be calm. Therefore, the comrades of the Ministry of Forest Industries could no longer bear it and posted countless big-character posters at the gate, refuting his reactionary views one by one under different topics. Then, the Ministry of Forest Industries and the Ministry of Forestry, together with the September 3rd Society branch, jointly held a debate to launch a reasoned struggle against this cunning and stubborn rightist.

　　“大字报”的威力
　　——记森林工业部斗争右派分子张楚宝
　　本报记者　刘时平
    走进森林工业部，到处可以看到形形色色的大字报，这些大字报用具体的事实和充分有力的道理，揭露和批判一个叫张楚宝的右派分子。
    张楚宝是森工部林产工业局的副局长、林业、森工两部九三学社支社的主委。他在大鸣大放时，打着帮助共产党整风的招牌，曾经发表了不少反共反人民反社会主义谬论。他诬蔑“肃反运动是违犯宪法”。他到处拉拢在肃反中被审查过的对象，煽动他们向党进攻。
    反右派开始，森工部的全体职工集中火力反击以部长罗隆基为首包括赵文璧的右派集团时，张楚宝不但不老老实实检查他的反动言行，相反还玩弄各种花招，企图蒙混过关，抗拒改造。只要看一看他耍的花招，就可以看出张楚宝这个右派分子是多么狡滑、阴险。
    还在反右派初期，林产工业局的技术员杨承基写了一张题为“赵文璧的阴险企图”的大字报，里边提到张楚宝曾通知杨承基去参加赵文璧召集的向党进攻的会。杨承基写好这张大字报，还没有贴出去，就被张楚宝发觉了。张楚宝作贼心虚，他不是面对事实，检查自己的错误，并揭发赵文璧的反动言行；相反还声色俱厉地责问杨承基：“你这是揭发谁？”这个狡猾的右派分子并威胁杨承基说，在大鸣大放时期，赵文璧要找森工部的各民主党派密谋联合行动，向党进攻，你虽没同意，但也没反对。他又让杨承基修改大字报，不要提张楚宝通知他去参加赵文璧召集的会议的过程。
    杨承基并没有受他的威胁，他肯定去赵文璧办公室谈各民主党派联合行动的事，是张楚宝通知他去的，而且当时在座的还有丘致中等，他们都是森工部的几个右派骨干。因此杨承基只把大字报上的某些措词作了一些修改，仍然贴了出去。
    张楚宝看到大字报后，到处活动，企图解脱。据揭发，他曾找有关的人说：“局里的作法不对，问题不在局里谈，动辄就拿出去。”但是没有人听他的鬼话，接着又有人贴了一张大字报，质问：“张楚宝这是为什么？”
    张楚宝对于这个质问，不但没有正面答复，相反又暗中活动，企图把大字报撕下来。但是他的这些阴谋，都被一一识破而未得逞。
    不久，和森工部在一个院子里办公的林业部经营局（张楚宝调到森林工业部前曾做过林业部经营局的副局长）的同志们把张楚宝的反动论点排了队，在大字报上一一驳斥。如张楚宝最恶毒的一个谬论是说“肃反违犯宪法”。大家根据本单位的具体情况，说明张楚宝这是彻头彻尾的胡说。经营局在肃反时有九个对象，其中两人查明确是反革命分子，已经按其罪行依法逮捕判刑，其他六个人也按其问题的不同情节作出结论，只有一个人的问题因调查牵涉方面多，目前尚未作结论。在肃反中被审查过的高镜伦，用他自己的亲身经历，说明通过肃反运动，弄清了他的历史问题，使他卸下了历史包袱，党对他更加信任了，他自己也感觉到轻松愉快。高镜伦还揭发了张楚宝利用整风的机会，曾经向他煽动点火。
    在大字报上还展开了对张楚宝包庇反革命分子曾庆和的问题的大辩论。曾庆和是一个恶霸地主，是一贯反共的反革命分子，解放后，混进森工部，在肃反时，才清查出来，依法逮捕判刑了。
    在事实面前，张楚宝见势不妙，赶快出了一张假检讨的大字报，说他所谓的“肃反违犯宪法”的反动观点是在参加九三学社北京分社的基层汇报会时，听了右派分子顾执中的发言，受了影响。他并到整风办公室耍无赖，要修改他的原话，说他是“人云亦云”，记录错了。经过核对后，事实胜于雄辩写在白纸上的字并没有一点错，而是他有意诬蔑。
    右派分子最怕摆事实，当铁证如山的事实摆在面前，如何狡辩，也是逃脱不了的。但是张楚宝这个阴险的右派分子是十分狡猾的。当时他就借故到上海，逃避过关。但在他出差期间，森工和林业两部的工作人员并没有放松对他的斗争，继续用各种形式的大字报揭发、批判他的反动论点。
    张楚宝原以为出差二十天，躲一下风，就可以事过境迁。不料回来以后，批判、驳斥他的反动言论的大字报接二连三贴了出来，要他低头认罪，彻底交代。
    到这时候，张楚宝还想假装镇静。于是森工部的同志们实在忍无可忍，集中在大门口贴出了无数张大字报，把他的反动观点分题一一驳斥，然后由森工和林业两部同九三学社支社联合召开了辩论会，向这个狡猾顽固的右派分子展开了说理斗争。
