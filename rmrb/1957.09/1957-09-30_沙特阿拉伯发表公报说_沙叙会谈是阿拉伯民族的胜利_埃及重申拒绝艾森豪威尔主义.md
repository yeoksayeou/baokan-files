Xinhua News Agency, September 29th dispatch: Jiddah dispatch: Saudi Arabia officially issued a communiqué on September 28th stating that Saudi Arabian King Saud is satisfied with the achievements of his recent meeting in Damascus with Syrian President Kuwatly.

The communiqué also stated that King Saud's recent trip to Damascus was to pursue the goal of unity among the Arab peoples. King Saud's recent trip to Damascus was a success and victory for the entire Arab nation.

Cairo dispatch: Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Egypt, Suleiman, said on the evening of September 28th upon returning to Cairo from Damascus that the talks between Saudi Arabian King Saud and Syrian President Kuwatly were successful, and that the talks defeated the conspiracies of those who wanted to fish in troubled waters. Suleiman said that Saudi Arabia's statement is a true reflection of its feelings and support for Syria. That is why it was issued in the form of a personal statement and not a joint communiqué.

He also said that it was purely coincidental that the Iraqi Prime Minister also came to Damascus during the talks between Saud and Kuwatly. The Iraqi Prime Minister did not participate in the talks between Saudi Arabia and Syria.

On the same day, Egyptian officials said that the atmosphere between Arab countries had become clearer after the talks between the King of Saudi Arabia and the President of Syria.

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th dispatch: London dispatch: Egyptian Intelligence Chief Colonel Hatem said on September 27th: Egypt refuses to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine because it means interference in Egypt's internal affairs.

He said in a television broadcast in London: "We will defend our independence from all aspects and maintain a policy of positive neutrality." He said: Egypt will accept aid from any side "if it does not come with conditions."

Hatem said: Egypt's economic situation has greatly improved, "and there is now no shortage of any basic things."

    沙特阿拉伯发表公报说
    沙叙会谈是阿拉伯民族的胜利
    埃及重申拒绝艾森豪威尔主义
    本报综合报道　据新华社29日讯：吉达消息：沙特阿拉伯官方9月28日发表公报说，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特对于他最近在大马士革同叙利亚总统库阿特利会晤的成就感到满意。
    公报还说，沙特国王最近到大马士革去，是为了追求阿拉伯各国人民之间的团结的目标。沙特国王最近的大马士革之行是整个阿拉伯民族的成功和胜利。
    开罗消息：沙特阿拉伯驻埃及大使苏莱曼28日晚间从大马士革回到开罗时说，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特同叙利亚总统库阿特利的会谈是成功的，这次会谈击败了那些想浑水摸鱼的人的阴谋。苏莱曼说，沙特的声明是他对叙利亚的感情和支持的真实表现。这就是它以个人声明而不以联合公报形式发表的原因。
    他还说，在沙特同库阿特利会谈期间，伊拉克首相也来到大马士革，这完全是巧合，伊拉克首相并没有参加沙特阿拉伯同叙利亚的会谈。
    同一天，埃及官方人士说，在沙特阿拉伯国王同叙利亚总统会谈以后，阿拉伯国家之间的气氛已经变得明朗了。
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：埃及情报局局长哈特姆上校9月27日说：埃及拒绝接受艾森豪威尔主义，因为这意味着对埃及内政的干涉。
    他在伦敦的电视广播中说：“我们将从一切方面来保卫我们的独立，维护积极中立主义的政策”。他说：埃及将接受任何方面的援助，“如果不附带条件的话”。
    哈特姆说：埃及经济情况已大为好转，“现在不缺乏任何基本的东西”。
