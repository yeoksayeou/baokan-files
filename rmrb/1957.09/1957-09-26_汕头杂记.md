　　At dusk, the tide comes in. The waves chase each other, rolling towards the shore, crashing against the embankment, creating a roaring sound. In the hazy twilight of the bay, the lights of several huge freighters come on. The small motorboat from Leikou to Shantou City also carries lights as it forges ahead in the sea.

　　Anyone who has been to Shantou City easily thinks of Waima Road at dusk. This is a magnificent, clean asphalt road that stretches along the seaside. The branches and leaves of the tall banyan trees along the street cover the blue sky. At night, the entire street seems to be immersed in clear water. As dusk arrives, the street becomes lively, with female students wearing wooden clogs, women taking their children for a stroll after a day of work, couples walking shoulder to shoulder, and civil servants with large palm-leaf fans, taking in the scene with appreciative eyes… People walk back and forth on this street, with their hearts open. The sea breeze, just climbing ashore, sometimes gently, like mountain spring water, sprinkles on people's bodies, nourishing their lungs; sometimes the leaves rustle, and the short hair of young girls is tousled; it makes people feel so refreshed that even the fatigue left over from the day is taken away.

　　At dawn, I strolled to the entrance of Zhongshan Park. At this time, the Han River bank was already crowded with women washing clothes. The young women's calico dresses flutter in the morning breeze, like countless flowers blooming on the river bank. The sounds of talking and splashing water from the Han River bank open the curtain on the day's labor for the residents of Shantou City. One morning, at the entrance of Zhongshan Park, I met several girls carrying baskets. They were wearing wooden clogs and coming from the river bank, with their baskets full of washed clothes. Due to their labor, their faces were flushed red, and beads of sweat were still flowing down. I was touched, walked over, and greeted them: "You are really early!" "It's cool to work in the morning!" one of them replied, looking at me suddenly and strangely. The other two were also stunned by this stranger, and then the three of them whispered and turned their heads to look at me as they walked away. I watched their backs, still remembering the badge of a certain middle school they wore on their chests.

　　An overseas Chinese who had lived abroad for more than twenty years once talked to me about his feelings after returning to China. One passage was specifically about Shantou: "More than twenty years ago," he said, "the women of Shantou were the most fashionable, wearing cheongsams, high heels, rouge, lipstick, perms… The streets were full of modern girls, but this time, as soon as I landed, I felt that the atmosphere was different. Everyone was dressed so plainly, like villagers. I asked a woman why she didn't dress up, and do you know what she said?" He paused and sipped his tea. "She said, 'No, that's a thing of the past. Now we are busy building a new life. Socialism is what matters, and wearing lipstick and rouge is secondary.'" He repeatedly praised, "The motherland has a way, socialism has a way, the Communist Party has a way, to educate everyone!"

　　In Shantou, there are air raid alarms almost every day, sometimes several times a day, but people firmly believe in the city's air defense capabilities. Once, after an emergency alarm sounded, people were still walking along the street in the shade of the trees on Waima Road. I asked a man who looked like a worker: "There's an emergency alarm, why aren't you hiding?" He looked at me strangely, and after learning that I was from out of town, he said very kindly: "No need. The alarms of a few years ago were a bit scary. At that time, enemy planes flew as high as the trees. Now, you can't even hear the sound of the planes. They fall into the sea as soon as they come!"

　　This year on "August 1st" [Army Day], Zhongshan Park held a domestic weapons exhibition. At this exhibition, there were various types of high-performance domestic guns and artillery. Particularly eye-catching were the giant anti-aircraft guns pointing towards the blue sky. Although the weather was very hot, the crowds of visitors flowed endlessly. Old ladies and women holding children also came to visit. They held umbrellas and stood in front of the gun barrels, listening to the soldiers who guarded the coastal defense day and night, their skin tanned by the wind and rain, introduce the performance of the weapons. Some even gave on-the-spot technical demonstrations of shooting. The soldiers operated skillfully, and the machinery turned flexibly. The audience praised these products of the motherland.

　　"Are these guns all very accurate?" An old woman asked a lieutenant standing next to her.

　　"These are the best guns, very accurate, old woman! As long as the enemy planes fly within their range, they can almost all be hit! Look, this gun has eight red stars." The lieutenant pointed to the red stars on the green gun barrel. The old woman squinted in the strong sunlight.

　　"What does this mean, drawing so many stars!"

　　"This is the number of enemy planes shot down or damaged."

　　"This gun has really made a contribution, shooting down so many thieves!"

　　"Every gun here has made a contribution! Look, every gun has many stars!"

　　On the top floor of the Shantou Building, you can overlook the entire city of Shantou. When the sun sets and the first star appears in the east, the whole city is brilliantly lit. In the vast twilight, looking south at the bay, in addition to the black shadows of a few small islands, there is also a small black shadow. It is said that it is a British merchant ship that was sunk by Chiang Kai-shek's planes in 1954. Shantou's air defense capabilities have been unprecedentedly strengthened, and Chiang Kai-shek's planes are completely powerless against Shantou. But those people whose merchant ships were destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes are still trying to collude with the Chiang gang, which is extremely shameful.

　　The sea breeze blows gently, and the lights of Shantou City and the stars in the sky compete for beauty. This is another intoxicating night.

    汕头杂记
    詹文豹
    黄昏，潮汛来了。波浪在追逐着，往岸上卷来，冲来，打在堤岩上，发出哗哗的咆哮声。在暮霭朦胧的海湾里，停泊着的几艘巨大的货轮的灯光亮起来了。由磊口到汕头市的小汽船也载着灯光在海里破浪前进。
    到过汕头市的人，到黄昏时分，很容易想起外马路来。这是一条壮阔的、干净的柏油路，它沿着海边伸长着。街旁的高大的榕树的枝叶遮盖着蓝空。在夜里，整条街道像沉浸在清水中似的。黄昏一来，街道热闹起来，这里有穿着木屐的女学生，有劳动一天之后带着孩子逛街的妇女，有一对对的肩并肩的情侣，有摇着大蒲扇的带着欣赏眼色的公务员……人们在这条街来回走着，敞开着胸怀。刚刚爬上岸来的海风，有时轻轻地，像山里的泉水，洒在人们的身上，滋润着人的心肺；有时树叶被刮得沙沙响了起来，撩乱了少女的短发；它使人感到这样清爽，连白天遗留下来的疲倦也被带走了。
    黎明时分，我漫步在中山公园的门口，这时，韩江江畔已挤满了洗衣服的妇女。青年妇女的花布衣裙在晨风的吹拂下，像无数朵开在河岸的鲜花。韩江江畔的谈话声、泼水声，把汕头市居民一天劳动的序幕揭开了。有一天早上，在中山公园门口，我遇到了几个提着篮子的姑娘，她们穿着木屐正从河岸中来，篮子里放着满满的洗好了的衣服。由于劳动，她们脸上红赤赤的，汗珠还在往下流着。我被感动了，走过去，向她们打了个招呼：“你们真早！”“早上工作凉快呀！”其中一个感到突然和出奇地望着我回答。其他两个也对我这个陌生人怔了一下，然后三个人边嘀咕边转过头来看我，走远了。我看着她们的背影，脑里还记着她们胸前佩着的某个中学的证章。
    一位侨居海外二十余年的华侨，曾经对我谈到归国后的感想，有一段话就是专门谈到汕头的：“在二十多年前，”他说，“汕头的女人是最爱打扮的，着旗袍，穿高跟鞋，擦胭脂，抹口红，烫发……街上到处是摩登女郎，可是这次我一上岸就感到味道不同了，大家都穿得那样朴素，像乡下人一样。我问一位妇女为什么不打扮了，你知道她怎样说？”他停下来呷了一口茶。“她说，‘不，这是过去的事了，现在我们忙于建设新生活，社会主义才有用，擦口红抹胭脂是次要的。’”他连声赞叹着说：“祖国有办法，社会主义有办法，共产党有办法，把什么人都教育过来了！”
    在汕头，几乎每天都有警报，有时一天数次，可是人们坚信这个城市的防空力量。有一次打了紧急警报后，在外马路的树荫下，人们还沿着街旁走着。我问一个职工模样的人：“紧急警报了你们还不躲起来？”他奇怪地打量着我，知道了我是从外地来的之后，就很和气地说：“不需要，前几年的警报是有点吓人的，那时敌机飞得和大树那么高，现在呢，连飞机声也听不见了，一来就掉在海里了！”
    今年“八一”节，中山公园举行了国产武器展览会。在这个展览会上，有着各色各样的效能良好的国产枪支和大炮。特别引人注目的，是那些高指蓝空的巨型高射炮。天气虽很炎热，但参观的人群川流不息。老太太和抱着孩子的妇女也来参观了。她们拿着雨伞站在炮身面前，听那日夜守卫在海防前线的在风雨中锻炼得肤色非常健康的战士给她们介绍武器的性能，有的还当面作射击的技术表演。战士们熟练地操作着，机械在灵活地转动。观众在赞美祖国的这些产品。
    “这些炮都打得顶准吗？”一个老大娘问在旁边的一个少尉道。
    “这是顶好的炮，准得很，老大娘！只要敌机飞到它的射程以内，差不多都能打中它！你看，这门炮就有八颗红星。”这个少尉指着绿色炮筒上的红星说。老大娘在强烈的阳光下眯着眼睛。
    “这是什么意思，画这么多的星！”
    “这是打落打伤敌机的数目。”
    “这门炮真有功劳，打掉这么多的贼！”
    “这里每门炮都有功劳！看，每门炮都有很多的星！”
    在汕头大厦的楼顶，这里可以了望汕头市的全景，当太阳下山，东方出现第一颗星星的时候，全市已是灯光辉煌了。在苍茫的暮色里，南望海湾，除了几个小岛的黑影外，还有一个小黑影，据说那是一艘在1954年被蒋机炸沉的英国商船。汕头防空力量已空前壮大了，蒋机对汕头已经完全无能为力。但是那些已经被蒋机打坏了商船的人们却还在企图勾搭蒋帮，这是异常可耻的。
    海风徐徐吹来，汕头市的灯光和天上的群星在竞相争艳。这又是一个醉人的夜晚。
