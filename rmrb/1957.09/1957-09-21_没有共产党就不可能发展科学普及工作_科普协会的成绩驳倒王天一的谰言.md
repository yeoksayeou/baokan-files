Without the Communist Party, it would be impossible to develop scientific popularization work.
The achievements of the Science Popularization Association refute Wang Tianyi's nonsense.

Beijing - The China Association for Science and Technology recently held a general meeting of cadres to expose and criticize the anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks of Wang Tianyi, a bourgeois rightist and deputy editor-in-chief of the Science Popularization Publishing House.

Wang Tianyi is a member of the Jiusan Society and currently serves as the deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society. During the period of the Great Blooming and Contending, Wang Tianyi ignited fires everywhere, seized on some of the masses' dissatisfaction, and incited them by drawing cartoons and writing big-character posters, describing the work of the Science Popularization Association led by the Communist Party over the past few years as "a complete mess." Wang Tianyi also falsely accused: "The Party does not value spiritual bricks and tiles, only material bricks and tiles," attempting to incite some intellectuals who had been investigated in the anti-espionage campaign and those who had been criticized in the past to make trouble.

At the meeting, everyone refuted Wang Tianyi's nonsense with living facts. Zhang Daoyi said: "In the past, no ruling class had ever managed scientific popularization work, only the Communist Party has truly developed this cause. Last year, nearly 300,000 science lectures were given, exceeding the number of lectures in 1955 by 23 times; more than 1,100 branch associations have been established across the country; more than 210,000 members have been developed; in addition, a Science Popularization Publishing House has been established, which has published more than 9 million copies of science booklets; and the first planetarium in New China has also been prepared. These living facts are sufficient to prove that the Communist Party and the government care about the development of scientific and technological popularization in our country. The argument that the work of the Science Popularization Association over the past few years is 'a complete mess' is a complete fabrication."

Wang Tianyi said that the Science Popularization Association was not as "warm" as the Jiusan Society, and he put forward the slogan of "scientists being masters of their own affairs." At the meeting, everyone unanimously pointed out that the association has already taken many measures to unite and give play to the guiding role of scientists in the association. Last year, the number of academic group members has increased to more than 500, and three science offices have been set up to specifically contact scientists and create convenient conditions for them. In 1954, the Science Popularization Association delegation to the Soviet Union visited scientific popularization work in various parts of the Soviet Union. After they returned, many of them became leading cadres of the association and are now actively participating in scientific popularization work.

Wang Tianyi also shouted the slogan of "laymen cannot lead experts," meaning that the Party cannot lead scientific popularization work. At the meeting, everyone pointed out that the facts over the past few years have proved that the Party is able to lead scientists to develop scientific popularization. The average monthly circulation of Science Masses published by Wang Tianyi's Minben Publishing Company before liberation did not exceed three or four thousand copies, but the Science Popularization Publishing House established by the Science Popularization Association last year reached a maximum circulation of more than 110,000 copies in less than a year, and has been distributed abroad. Wang Tianyi kept silent about these facts, but said: Now the "Party leading cadres of the Science Popularization Publishing House are restricting me from playing my role, and the quality of publications is not as good as in the past."

Luan Lanyu of the National Science Popularization Association revealed at the meeting: In 1936, Wang Tianyi was sent by the Kuomintang to Suzhou to receive centralized military training from the Kuomintang. The following year, he was introduced by Zhang Daofan, a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee and Minister of Central Propaganda, a cultural special agent, and Pan Gongzhan, a Kuomintang secret service leader, and joined the Kuomintang. Later, he actively carried out anti-Communist and anti-people activities at the puppet Jiaotong University. After Chiang Kai-shek was released in Xi'an during the "December 12th Incident," Wang Tianyi led students to shout reactionary slogans such as "Down with the Communist Party." In addition, Wang Tianyi also joined many reactionary organizations such as the China Revolutionary Youth Force Society.

Rightist Wang Tianyi also spoke at the meeting. He admitted that he was an anti-Communist and anti-socialist bourgeois rightist and expressed his willingness to bow his head and confess his guilt to the people. (Xinhua News Agency Special)

### 没有共产党就不可能发展科学普及工作  科普协会的成绩驳倒王天一的谰言

    没有共产党就不可能发展科学普及工作
    科普协会的成绩驳倒王天一的谰言
    本报讯　中华全国科学技术普及协会最近召开全体干部大会，揭露和批判资产阶级右派分子、科学普及出版社副总编辑王天一反共反社会主义的言行。
    王天一是九三学社的社员，现任九三学社北京分社宣传部副部长。大鸣大放期间，王天一到处点火，抓住部分群众的一些不满情绪，大肆煽动，画漫画，写大字报，把共产党所领导的科普协会几年来的工作说成“一团糟”。王天一还诬蔑说：“党不重视精神砖瓦，只重视物质砖瓦，”企图煽动一些在肃反运动中被审查过的和过去被批评过的知识分子起来闹事。
    在大会上，大家用活生生的事实驳斥了王天一的谰言。章道义说：“过去，任何一个统治阶级都没有管过科学普及工作，只有共产党才把这个事业真正发展起来。去年科学讲演一项近三十万次，超过1955年讲演次数的二十三倍；全国已建立了一千一百多个支会；发展了二十一万多会员；此外还成立了一个科学普及出版社，已经出版了九百多万册科学小册子；还筹办了新中国第一座天文馆。这些活生生的事实足以证明共产党和政府关心我国科学技术普及事业的发展，那种说科普协会几年来的工作是‘一团糟’的论调是彻头彻尾的造谣。”
    王天一说科普协会不如九三学社“温暖”，他提出了所谓“科学家当家作主”的口号。在会上大家一致指出，协会在团结和发挥科学家对协会的指导作用方面已经采取了许多措施，拿去年来说，学组委员已经增加到五百多人，并且设立了三个科学室专门负责联系科学家，给他们创造了便利条件。曾经在1954年，组织了科普协会访苏代表团赴苏联各地参观了科学普及工作，他们回来后，许多人已经成了协会的领导骨干，现在都积极参加科学普及工作。
    王天一还喊出“外行不能领导内行”的口号，意思是指党不能领导科学普及工作。在会上大家指出，几年来的事实证明党是能够领导科学家发展科学普及事业的。王天一在解放前所办的民本出版公司所出版的科学大众每月平均发行量不超过三、四千份，可是科普协会在去年成立的科学普及出版社不到一年时间，“科学大众”的最高发行量达到过十一万多份，并且已经发行到国外。王天一闭口不谈这种事实，却说什么：现在科学普及出版社的“党员领导干部箝制我不能发挥作用，出版物质量不如过去。”
    全国科普栾兰玉在会上揭露：1936年王天一被国民党派到苏州受国民党的集中军训后，第二年由国民党中央委员兼中央宣传部长、文化特务张道藩，国民党特务头子潘公展的介绍加入了国民党。以后在伪交通大学积极进行过反共反人民的活动。“双十二”蒋介石在西安被释放后，王天一曾率领学生高呼：“打倒共产党”等反动口号。此外王天一还曾经加入过中国革命青年力社等许多反动组织。
    右派分子王天一也在大会上发了言。他承认自己是反共反社会主义的资产阶级右派分子，并表示愿意向人民低头认罪。（新华社专稿）
