Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: According to a report, Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Bizri told an Associated Press reporter on September 22nd that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly was a typical "savage war cry."

He also said, "Dulles and the imperialists who follow him always believe that any Syrian who tries to defend his country is a communist or relies on Moscow. In reality, Dulles himself is an imperialist slave in the United States. That is why he cannot sympathize with anyone who works for his own country."

Bizri said that because Dulles had made such remarks, Syria believed it must take some measures to protect itself. He said: "Syria is carrying out certain defensive activities, therefore, it has ordered the Damascus garrison not to leave their barracks. But I want to emphasize that all the precautionary measures taken so far are defensive actions to prepare Syria to cope with any eventuality."

Regarding the issue of Syrian-U.S. relations, Bizri said he was prepared to discuss U.S.-Syrian relations with anyone from the United States. He said, "The United States should approach Syria with good intentions and a better understanding."

According to the Damascus "Today's News" report on September 22nd, 3,000 Turkish troops, some heavy artillery, and about 200 trucks loaded with weapons and ammunition, have recently arrived and are concentrating in the Bab al-Hawa area near the northern border of Syria. "Guangming Daily" also reported on the 23rd that Syrian residents along the Syrian-Turkish border saw Turkish troops gathering in the Turkish villages of Ein Jiao, A'muda, and Dêrik, where some artillery pieces were set up, with their muzzles pointing towards Syria.

Meanwhile, according to news from Washington, Turkish Finance Minister Polatkan has asked the United States to step up its military and economic "aid" to Turkey. Polatkan told reporters on September 21st that the situation in Syria was "very serious," and this situation had "increased Turkey's responsibility." He said the United States' "aid" to Turkey should be "reviewed" in accordance with this situation. He expressed his hope to discuss this issue with Dulles.

    针对杜勒斯在联大的战争叫嚣
    比兹里重申叙利亚必须自卫
    土耳其继续陈兵叙边境并求美国撑腰
    本报综合报道　据新华社23日讯：叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里9月22日对美联社记者说，美国国务卿杜勒斯最近在联合国大会上的演说是典型的“野蛮的战争叫嚣”。
    他还说，“杜勒斯和跟随他的帝国主义分子们永远认为，任何试图保卫自己国家的叙利亚人就是共产党人或者是依靠莫斯科的。实际上，杜勒斯自己是在美国的一个帝国主义奴隶。这就是他不能够同情任何为自己的国家工作的人的原因。”
    比兹里说，由于杜勒斯发表了这样的言论，叙利亚认为它必须采取一些措施来保护它自己。他说：“叙利亚正在执行某些防卫活动，因此，它已命令大马士革卫戍部队不得离开他们的营房。但是我要强调指出，迄今所采取的一切预防性措施都是防卫性的行动，使叙利亚在应付任何意外时有所准备。”
    关于叙美关系问题，比兹里说，他准备和美国来的任何人讨论美叙关系。他说，“美国应对叙利亚抱着良好的意图和有较好的了解”。
    据大马士革“今天报”9月22日报道，土耳其军队三千人、一些重炮和装着武器和弹药的大约二百辆卡车，已经在最近到达接近叙利亚北部边境的巴布·阿尔·哈瓦地区集中。“光明报”也在23日报道，沿叙利亚—土耳其国境线的叙利亚居民看到土耳其军队在土耳其境内的埃因角、阿毛达和德里克等村庄集结，这些村庄里架设了一些大炮，炮口指叙利亚。
    同时据华盛顿消息，土耳其财政部长波拉特干要求美国加紧对土耳其进行军事和经济“援助”。波拉特干9月21日向新闻记者说，叙利亚局势“非常严重”，这种情况使得土耳其的“责任加重”了，美国对土耳其的“援助”应该按照这种情况进行“审查”。他表示希望就这个问题同杜勒斯会谈。
