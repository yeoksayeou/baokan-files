    Japan's "Diploma Mills"
    Currently, 70% of universities in Japan are private. According to the "Asahi Shimbun" on September 1, many of these private universities are "diploma mills" with the purpose of "making money." Some private universities have only two or three full-time professors, and some don't even have a single foreign language reference book for students to use for research. The teaching equipment is simple and crude, and the content of lectures is extremely poor. The private Urawa Junior College, which recently closed, lasted less than a year from its opening to its closure.
    Last summer, the Japanese government established a "University Establishment Review Board," but it has not been able to change this phenomenon of "recklessly opening universities to seek profit" in the slightest. On August 31 this year, the Japanese Ministry of Education issued another order stipulating that, starting next year, the current total amount of school assets and cash holdings will be doubled in order to restrict the reckless opening of universities. Since universities have already become "diploma mills" with the purpose of making money, simply restricting them in terms of start-up funds will not change their nature, and the quality of teaching will be difficult to improve.

### 日本的“学店”

    日本的“学店”
    现在日本的大学中70％是私立的。据9月1日“朝日新闻”说，这些私立大学很多是以“赚钱”为目的的“学店”。有些私立大学只有两、三个专任教授，有的连一本供学生研究用的外文参考书也没有，教学设备简陋，讲授内容极为贫乏。前不久关门的私立浦和短期大学，从开校到倒闭，总共不到一年。
    去年夏天，日本政府曾成立了“大学设置审查会”，可是丝毫也没有能改变这种“乱开大学谋利”的现象。今年8月31日，日本文部省又发布了一道命令，规定从明年度起，把现行的学校资产总额和现金保有数额提高一倍，以限制乱开大学。既然大学已经成了“学店”，是以赚钱为目的，光从开办资金方面加以限制，并不能改变它们的性质，教学质量也很难提高。
