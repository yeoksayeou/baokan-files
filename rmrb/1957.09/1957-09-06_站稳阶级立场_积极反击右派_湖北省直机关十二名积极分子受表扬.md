In the Struggle's Waves

    Stand Firm on Class Standpoint, Actively Counterattack the Rightists
    Twelve Activists from Hubei Province's Directly Subordinate Organs Commended

Twelve anti-Rightist struggle activists from Hubei Province's directly subordinate organs were commended by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League at a meeting of Communist Youth League members and activists in the anti-Rightist struggle from the province's directly subordinate organs held on the 4th.

The twelve commended activists are Tan Zhenglong, Luo Kuisheng, Yang Xiufeng, Li Yunkuan, Ge Longwen, Xiang He, Liu Zhongwu, Zheng Chengjia, Wu Yingjun, Luo Zhili, Xiong Musheng, and Zhang Yujun. They are all excellent Communist Youth League members or League cadres who, during the rectification campaign to help the Communist Party and in the anti-Rightist struggle, consistently stood firmly on the proletarian standpoint, bravely fought against the Rightist elements, and defended the interests of the Communist Party.

After the start of the great blooming and contending at the Hubei Provincial Commercial School, Rightist elements posted big-character posters everywhere opposing the Communist Party and opposing the school leadership. At the same time, they used the backward thinking of some students who believed that "commercial work has no future" to incite students to strike and make trouble. Tan Zhenglong, a student and member of the Communist Youth League General Branch Committee at this school, felt that this was not an attitude of helping the Communist Party with rectification. He actively explained the issue of the future of commercial work to the students and opposed unjustified strikes and disturbances. He was met with various sarcastic and abusive remarks. When Rightist elements manipulated students to hold secret meetings to discuss and pass an anti-Communist and anti-socialist program and to carry out a strike, the Rightist elements forced him not to report their secrets to the organization and insisted that he agree with their program. Tan Zhenglong retorted on the spot: "I must report to the leadership; it is my responsibility. Why can't the truth be seen?" He sternly rejected their reactionary program. Finally, he was driven out of the meeting, but he still resolutely said: "You have your standpoint, and I have my standpoint. I would rather die than give up socialism!" After the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, Tan Zhenglong worked with other Communist Youth League cadres to do a lot of arduous ideological mobilization work for the students and, together with the vast number of League members and young people, boldly exposed the crimes of the Rightist elements.

Luo Zhili, a technician at the Hubei Provincial Geological Bureau and a member of the Communist Youth League, realized at the first engineers' forum for airing views that the speech of engineer Lu Shoukang (a Rightist element) was not a well-intentioned suggestion to the Communist Party. As soon as the anti-Rightist struggle began, Luo Zhili was the first to write a big-character poster exposing Lu Shoukang's anti-Communist words and deeds. At that time, the anti-Rightist struggle in this organ had not yet been well developed, and Luo Zhili was immediately besieged by Lu Shoukang and some people who had been won over by Lu. However, Luo Zhili did not waver or compromise. With the support of the League branch, he insisted on fighting against the Rightist elements. Under his leadership, some of the masses who were originally unclear in their understanding also actively rose up to counterattack the Rightist elements.

Communist Youth League member Luo Kuisheng is a staff member of the Provincial Urban Service Department. In 1955, during the "Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" campaign, he had been investigated. During the great blooming and contending, Rightist elements repeatedly incited him to attack the Communist Party. However, Luo Kuisheng always stood firm. He said: "The relevant departments investigated me based on evidence. In order to clarify my problem, the relevant departments conducted a serious investigation and verification. When my problem was clarified, my work was not affected at all, and the relevant leaders also expressed their concern to me. This shows that the Communist Party is seeking truth from facts." After the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, Luo Kuisheng actively exposed the various despicable means by which Rightist elements tried to win him over.

    站稳阶级立场　积极反击右派
    湖北省直机关十二名积极分子受表扬
    湖北省直属机关十二名反右派斗争积极分子，在4日举行的省直属机关共青团员反右派斗争活动分子大会上，受到共青团湖北省委的表扬。
    这十二名受表扬的积极分子是谭正隆、罗奎生、杨秀峰、李蕴宽、葛隆文、向何、刘中武、郑承家、巫英俊、罗志立、熊木生和章彧俊。他们都是优秀的共青团员或团的干部，在帮助共产党整风和反右派斗争中，始终坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，同右派分子勇敢地进行斗争，捍卫着共产党的利益。
    湖北省商业学校大鸣大放开始后，右派分子到处张贴反对共产党、反对学校领导的大字报，同时利用一部分学生认为“商业工作无前途”的落后思想，煽动学生起来罢课，起来闹事。这个学校的学生、共青团总支委员谭正隆感到这不是帮助共产党整风的态度，便针对商业工作的前途问题，积极地向学生们解释，反对无故罢课闹事。他遭到各种冷言冷语的讽刺和谩骂。当右派分子操纵学生开秘密会议，讨论通过反共反社会主义的纲领和进行罢课时，右派分子逼着要他不向组织汇报他们的秘密，并且硬要他赞成他们的纲领。谭正隆当场反驳说：“我非要向领导上汇报不可，这是我的责任，是真理为什么见不得人？”他严正地拒绝了他们的反动纲领。最后他被赶出了会场，但是他仍然坚决地说：“你有你的立场，我有我的立场，头可断，血可流，社会主义我要守。”反右派斗争开始后，谭正隆又和别的共青团干部一起对学生们做了许多艰苦的思想发动工作，并和广大团员、青年一起，大胆地揭露了右派分子的罪行。
    湖北省地质局技术员、共青团员罗志立在第一次工程师鸣放座谈会上，便觉察到工程师陆寿康（右派分子）的发言不是善意的对共产党提意见。反右派斗争一开始，罗志立就第一个写大字报揭露陆寿康的反共言行。当时这个机关的反右派斗争还未很好开展，罗志立立刻受到陆寿康和被陆拉拢的一部分人的围攻，但罗志立没有动摇妥协，在团支部支持下，和右派分子坚持斗争。在他的带动下，原来一些认识模糊的群众，也积极起来向右派分子反击。
    共青团员罗奎生是省城市服务厅的工作人员，1955年在“肃反”时，曾被审查过。大鸣大放中，右派分子们多次煽动他向共产党进攻，可是罗奎生始终站稳立场，他说：“有关部门审查我是有根据的，为了查清我的问题，有关部门严肃地进行了调查、对证。当查清了我的问题后，我的工作一点没受到影响，有关领导还对我进行了慰问，这正说明共产党是实事求是的。”反右派斗争开始后，罗奎生积极揭露了右派分子拉拢他的各种卑鄙手段。
