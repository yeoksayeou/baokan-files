Handicraft Introduction

    Unfading Flowers

    The Tongcao flower potted landscape of Yangzhou, Jiangsu, is a new type of flower arrangement cultivated from folk crafts after liberation. Now, the Shanghai Native Produce Export Company has recommended it to the international market.

    In the past, Yangzhou Tongcao flowers were exclusively for women's ornaments. Before and after liberation, as fewer women wore flowers, flower makers switched to other professions. It was not until 1953 that the artisan Qian Hongcai created a Tongcao chrysanthemum potted landscape, which participated in a chrysanthemum exhibition and won the praise of the audience. From then on, Tongcao flowers found a new way to develop.

    This kind of potted landscape is made of materials such as Tongcao, Xuan paper, copper wire, iron wire, oil paint, and gypsum.

    不谢之花
    江苏扬州的通草花盆景，是解放后从民间工艺品中培养出来的新的花盆之一，现在，上海土产出口公司已经把它向国际市场推荐了。
    扬州通草花过去是专供妇女装饰的。解放前后，妇女戴花的减少，制花艺人也就纷纷转业。直到1953年，艺人钱宏才创作了通草菊花盆景，参加菊花展览会，博得观众的好评。从此，通草花就找到了发展的新途径。
    这种盆景是用通草、宣纸、铜丝、铁丝、油彩色、石膏等原料制作出来的。    　蒋雄　方猷（附图片）
