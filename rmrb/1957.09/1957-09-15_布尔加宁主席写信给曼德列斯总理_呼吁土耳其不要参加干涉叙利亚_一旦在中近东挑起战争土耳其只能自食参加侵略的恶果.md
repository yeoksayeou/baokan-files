Xinhua News Agency, 14th: TASS reported on the 13th that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, in a letter to Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, stated that the Soviet government appeals in the most friendly manner to the Turkish government not to participate in the armed intervention in Syria, a matter with dangerous consequences, and should help stop events in the Near and Middle East from developing in an unpleasant direction and prevent armed conflict from breaking out in the region.

　　The letter was delivered by the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey to the Turkish Prime Minister on September 11. Bulganin wrote in the letter that the Soviet Union has not and does not want to obtain any special economic or other benefits in the Near and Middle East region, but is only committed to maintaining and strengthening peace in the Near and Middle East, and politically hopes that all countries in the region can develop independently and autonomously in accordance with the interests of their own nations.

　　Bulganin emphasized that the U.S. plan to launch military action against Syria is counting on Turkey to play a certain role. We certainly do not want to believe this, but there are signs that Turkish leaders apparently have a tendency to cater to this plan. We do not hide that we are extremely uneasy about the news of the gathering of Turkish troops on the Syrian border and the U.S. transporting weapons to Turkey in order to achieve an offensive against Syria.

　　Bulganin said that the Soviet Union has noticed that the Near and Middle East region is very close to the Soviet Union, and considering the interests of its own national security, it naturally cannot turn a blind eye to the development of events, because the development of events may lead to armed conflict in the region, especially because the danger of undermining peace is very likely to extend beyond the scope of this region.

　　Bulganin expressed his belief that if Turkey acts in accordance with the will of those foreign groups that do not care about maintaining peace in the Near and Middle East, but only want to seek exorbitant profits by exploiting the wealth of this region, it may bring great misfortune to itself. Once military action against Syria breaks out, once a war is provoked in the Near and Middle East, there is no doubt that Turkey will only reap the bitter fruit of participating in this aggression, and its position in this region will inevitably go bankrupt. Bulganin said: "One cannot but take into account the geographical conditions of this conflict in which Turkey may participate." As long as military action begins in one area, it can turn into a widespread conflict at any time. In this way, it is difficult to limit it to one region.

　　Bulganin wrote: "Mr. Prime Minister, please believe that no one will truly believe the kind of ulterior motives that are now popular: as if Syria might threaten the security of this and that country in the Near and Middle East. We believe that even the people who spread such rumors probably do not believe this statement themselves."

　　Bulganin, in the name of the Soviet government, assured the Turkish government that the Soviet Union only sincerely and warmly hopes to maintain friendly and good-neighborly relations with Turkey. Bulganin wrote: "We hope that the Turkish government will study the above-mentioned views with great importance, and we are also prepared to study the Turkish government's views on all issues related to maintaining peace and security in the Near and Middle East. At present, this task is of great significance for the cause of maintaining universal and lasting peace."

　　布尔加宁主席写信给曼德列斯总理
　　呼吁土耳其不要参加干涉叙利亚
　　一旦在中近东挑起战争土耳其只能自食参加侵略的恶果
    新华社14日讯  据塔斯社13日报道，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在给土耳其总理曼德列斯的一封信中说，苏联政府极为友好地呼吁土耳其政府不要参加武装干涉叙利亚这样一件有危险后果的事情，应当协助制止中近东事件朝着不愉快的方向发展、制止这个地区爆发武装冲突。
    这封信是苏联驻土耳其大使在9月11日交给土耳其总理的。布尔加宁在信中写道，苏联没有而且不想在近东和中东地区得到什么特别的经济利益或其他利益，只不过在致力于维护和加强中近东地区的和平，在政治上希望这个地区的所有国家能够按照本民族的利益独立自主地发展。
    布尔加宁强调指出，美国正在策划的对叙利亚发动军事行动的计划指望土耳其去担任某种角色。我们当然不愿意相信这点，但是有迹象表明，土耳其的领导人，显然有迎合这种计划的倾向。我们不隐瞒，我们对于土耳其军队在叙利亚边境结集以及美国把武器运送到土耳其以便实现对叙利亚进攻的消息感到异常不安。
    布尔加宁说，苏联注意到中近东地区离苏联很近，考虑到自己国家安全的利益，自然不能对事件的发展置若罔闻，因为事件的发展可能导致这个地区的武装冲突，特别是因为破坏和平的危险很可能超出这个地区的范围。
    布尔加宁表示相信，如果土耳其按照那些根本不关心维护中近东和平、而只想靠剥削这一地区财富来谋取暴利的外国集团的意志行事，它就可能给自己招来巨大的不幸。一旦爆发反对叙利亚的军事行动，一旦在中近东挑起了战争，毫无疑问，土耳其只能自食参加这种侵略的恶果，而它在这一地区的地位就必然会破产。布尔加宁说：“还不能不考虑到土耳其将要参加的可能发生的这种冲突的地理条件。”军事行动只要在一个地区开始了，就随时有可能变为广泛的冲突。这样就很难再把它限制在一个地区范围内了。
    布尔加宁写道：“总理先生，请您相信，没有人会真正地相信现在流行的那种别有用心的说法：好像叙利亚可能威胁中近东这个和那个国家的安全。我们认为，就是散布这类说法的人自己恐怕都不会相信这种说法。”
    布尔加宁以苏联政府的名义向土耳其政府保证，苏联只是真诚而热情地希望同土耳其保持友好的睦邻关系。布尔加宁写道：“我们希望，上面所谈的看法，土耳其政府能极重视地加以研究，我们也准备研究土耳其政府对有关保持中近东和平与安全这个任务的一切问题的看法。目前，这个任务对维护普遍持久和平事业有着巨大的意义。”
