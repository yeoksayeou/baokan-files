    Absolute Egalitarianism is a Poisoned Arrow of the Rightists
    In this great blooming and contending, the bourgeois rightists have pulled out the old weapon of "absolute egalitarianism" to viciously attack our country's socialist material distribution system. Do the rightists really want to implement some kind of absolute egalitarianism? Of course not. Because the rightists possess the bourgeois nature, they not only do not advocate "equality," but on the contrary, what they hope for is the restoration of the capitalist exploitation system, so that they can live a life of arbitrarily plundering, enslaving, and oppressing people. Absolute egalitarianism is not a bourgeois idea, but a long-standing idea of peasants and handicraftsmen, a reflection of the petty-bourgeois view of equality in economics. Absolute egalitarianism is a backward and utopian fantasy of the petty bourgeoisie that is impossible to realize in any historical situation. Although our current social material distribution has not achieved the fairest and most reasonable communist principle—"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"—it is in line with the current objective reality. The rightists distort the due differences in material distribution under socialism due to different natures of labor as a "feudal hierarchy," and vilify state workers who enjoy reasonable treatment as "corrupt and degenerated" "privileged classes." This deliberately equates the necessary differences in our socialist material distribution with the exploiting classes' possession of the means of production, which precisely demonstrates their hostility towards socialism. (Excerpt from Ding Xue's "Absolute Egalitarianism is a Poisoned Arrow of the Rightists Attacking Socialism," "China Youth" semi-monthly, No. 17, 1957)
        What is the Political Standard for Leadership, Expert or Not?
    In class society, there is no such thing as a supra-class business leadership relationship. The ruling class of society always organizes and leads its various social undertakings according to its own class principles, and can never guide its activities with the principles of other classes. Class struggle is the struggle of the major classes for leadership over society. Therefore, in class society, the leadership of any undertaking is always a class leadership, a political leadership. Therefore, there is only one political standard—the class standard—for expertise in leadership issues. Whoever is proficient in the general laws of class struggle and the relevant special laws, resolutely promotes and implements the program, line, principles, and policies of his own class to guide and organize the undertakings of his own industry, and consciously serves the interests of his own class, such a leadership group and its members are expert leaders; otherwise, they are not very expert or are inexpert. Our country's current class struggle also fully proves that only the working class and the Communist Party are the only expert leaders in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. The leftists resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road. The rightists oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose taking the socialist road. The middle-of-the-roaders are two-sided and vacillate between the left and right. Obviously, the middle-of-the-roaders cannot lead the cause of socialism; the rightists are only expert in leading the evil deeds of opposing communism and opposing socialism. (Excerpt from Lin Gan's "A Brief Discussion on Expertise," Shenyang Daily, August 31)
    We Must Learn to Educate Peasants by Reasoning. The Question Now is Not Whether There is Reason to Be Made Clear. Socialism is the Truth, and the Truth is on Our Side. The problem is that some comrades still do not believe or do not fully believe that the great debate and reasoning can solve problems. These comrades are often too confident in themselves and do not have much faith in the masses, thinking that if they cannot convince people, the masses will be even less able to do so. Therefore, they still have doubts about the great debate method and the principle of convincing people with reason, and still want to use the old method of "I beat you until you understand" or "I suppress you until you submit" to solve people's ideological problems. In order to ensure the rapid and vigorous development of the great debate and to earnestly implement the principle of convincing people with reason, all localities should further strengthen the education of grassroots cadres, so that they understand the benefits of the great debate, establish the viewpoint of trusting and relying on the masses, and believe that debate and reasoning can solve problems, recognizing that although the past methods of "I beat you until you understand" also had some results, they did not solve problems thoroughly; we can only use persuasive methods towards the people, and cannot adopt suppressive methods, because suppressive methods cannot solve ideological problems. (Excerpt from the Shandong Dazhong Daily editorial, September 1: "We Must Be Good at Reasoning in the Great Debate")

    报刊论文摘要
      绝对平均主义是右派分子的一支毒箭
    在这次大鸣大放中，资产阶级右派分子搬出“绝对平均主义”的陈旧武器，恶毒地攻击我们国家的社会主义物质分配制度。右派分子难道真的想实行什么绝对平均主义么？当然不是。因为右派分子具有资产阶级的本性，他们不但不主张“平均”，相反的他们所希望的是恢复资本主义剥削制度，好让他们能够过着任意掠夺人奴役人压迫人的生活。绝对平均主义并不是资产阶级思想，而是一种由来已久的农民手工业者的思想，是小资产阶级平等观在经济上的反映。绝对平均主义在任何历史情况下都是不可能实现的小资产阶级的落后的空想。我们现在的社会物质分配尽管没有实现最公平合理的共产主义原则——“各尽所能，各取所需”，但却是合乎当前客观实际情况的。右派分子把社会主义的由于劳动性质不同所形成的物质分配上应有的差别歪曲为“封建等级制度”，把享受合理待遇的国家工作人员丑化为“腐化变质”了的“特权阶级”，是故意把我们社会主义物质分配上必要的差别和剥削阶级占有生产资料混为一谈，正表明了他们的敌视社会主义。（摘自1957年“中国青年”半月刊第十七期丁雪：“绝对平均主义是右派分子向社会主义进攻的毒箭”）
        领导内行与否的政治标准是什么？
    在阶级社会中超阶级的业务领导关系是没有的。社会的统治阶级总是按照自己的阶级原则来组织和领导自己的各项社会事业，绝对不可能以其他阶级的原则来指导自己的活动。阶级斗争是各主要阶级争夺对社会领导权的斗争。所以，在阶级社会中，任何事业的领导总是一种阶级的领导、政治上的领导。因此，领导问题上的内行与外行只有一个政治标准——阶级标准。凡是精通阶级斗争的一般规律和有关的特殊规律，坚决推行、执行本阶级的纲领路线、方针政策来指导和组织本行的事业，自觉地为本阶级的利益服务，这样的领导集团及其成员就是内行的领导者；否则是不太内行或外行。我国当前的阶级斗争也最充分地证明了：只有工人阶级、共产党是我国进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的唯一内行的领导者。左派是坚决拥护共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路的。右派是反对共产党的领导，反对走社会主义道路的。中间派因具有两面性，动摇于左、右两派之间。显然，中间派是不能领导社会主义的事业；右派只内行于领导反共反社会主义的罪恶勾当。（摘自8月31日沈阳日报林干：“略论内行与外行”）
    必须学会用讲理的办法教育农民现在不是有没有道理可讲的问题，社会主义就是真理，真理是在我们方面。问题是有一些同志至今还不相信或不完全相信大辩论讲道理能够解决问题。这些同志往往是过于相信自己，不大相信群众，认为自己说不服人，群众就更不行。因此，对于大辩论办法和以理服人的原则还抱怀疑态度，还想用我打你通我压你服的老办法来解决人们的思想问题。为了保证大辩论的迅速有力的开展，并切实贯彻执行以理服人的原则，各地应进一步加强基层干部的教育，使其了解大辩论的好处，树立相信群众依靠群众的观点，相信辩论讲理能够解决问题，认识过去我打你通的办法虽也有一些成效，但解决问题不深透；对人民群众只能用说服的办法，不能采取压服的办法，压服的办法并不能解决思想问题。（摘自9月1日山东大众日报社论：“大辩论中必须善于讲道理”）
