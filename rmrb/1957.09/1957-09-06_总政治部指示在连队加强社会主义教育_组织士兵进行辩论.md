Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army yesterday issued a directive to the entire army regarding the implementation of socialist education in companies.

The directive stated that the purpose of conducting this education is to help the broad masses of soldiers and company cadres further clarify the major issues of right and wrong in the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, enabling them to stand firm and raise their awareness in the current nationwide anti-rightist struggle and the socialist great debate unfolding in the countryside. Furthermore, it aims to make them understand the significant role of agricultural cooperativization, the unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products, and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance in the socialist revolution.

The directive stipulated five central topics for education: First, the superiority of cooperatives; second, the unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products; third, worker-peasant relations; fourth, observing discipline and improving service attitude; and fifth, officer-soldier relations.

The directive mentioned that the main method of conducting education is to organize mass debates. Before the debates, unit leaders should give enlightening reports, mobilize soldiers to raise questions and opinions, and initiate debates in an orderly and prepared manner. During the debates, use reasoning, presenting facts, and methods of recollection and comparison to explain the issues. In the debates, fully unleash the masses' free thought and allow soldiers to speak their minds freely. When criticizing erroneous opinions, it is imperative to adhere to reasoning and adopt a gentle and persuasive approach to resolve problems and conduct persuasion. After the debates, it is necessary to conduct summaries to achieve the goals of distinguishing right from wrong and raising awareness.
