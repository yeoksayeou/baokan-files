Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan said at a welcome rally held by people from all walks of life in Beijing today that as long as all countries follow the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and use peaceful consultation to handle problems, there is no problem in the world that cannot be solved. The Vice President also advocated the abolition of nuclear weapons and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

More than 8,000 people attended the welcome rally, which was held at the Beijing Gymnasium. At 4 p.m., Vice President Radhakrishnan, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, and Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru, etc., entered the venue and ascended to the rostrum. At this moment, everyone stood up, and applause, cheers, and military music sounded as one. Children from the capital presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

In his speech, Vice President Radhakrishnan talked about his impressions of the Chinese people. He said that he saw a disciplined and dedicated nation.

The Vice President emphasized that only by abolishing nuclear weapons and stopping nuclear weapons testing can the world move towards unity and produce fruitful world friendship. He called on governments of all countries to use atomic power for the benefit of mankind.

The Vice President finally said that the Indian government and the Indian people guarantee to abide by the principles proposed in China, namely "Sino-Indian Friendship" and "World Peace." The Vice President's speech received an extremely warm welcome (full text of the speech on page four).

At the beginning of the welcome rally, the military band played the national anthems of China and India. Mayor Peng Zhen first gave a speech welcoming Vice President Radhakrishnan. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people is as lofty, eternal, and unyielding as the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas that link our two countries.

Peng Zhen said that colonialists are carrying out blatant aggressive conspiracies and provocative actions against Syria, threatening peace in the Middle East and the world, which is intolerable to the people of Asia and Africa.

Peng Zhen also said that as long as the people of Asian and African countries firmly unite and stand together with all peace-loving people in the world, the just cause of the people of Asia and Africa will surely triumph.

Mayor Peng Zhen also presented a flag and gifts to Vice President Radhakrishnan on behalf of the people of Beijing.

At today's meeting, artists from the capital also performed wonderful artistic programs for the distinguished guests, including Indian dances and songs. After the performance, Vice President Radhakrishnan, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and others, stepped down from the rostrum and came to the center of the hall. Here, the Vice President presented flower baskets to the performers and took pictures with them.
