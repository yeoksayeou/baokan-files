　　The Image of a Foreign Slave
　　Zhu Wei
    Rightists all have their own "confidants" in their hearts. Liu Wang Liming is a Chinese, but her "confidant" is American imperialism. According to reports, before liberation, she received a high salary from her American masters, and after liberation, until 1951, she continued to accept a "subsidy" of 300 US dollars per month from American imperialism. She has her own mother, but she dislikes her for being Chinese and "not presentable," so she recognized an American "godmother," and the benefit the goddaughter received was "inheriting" an estate of about 10,000 US dollars.
    "He who gives milk is my mother." The "mother" in Liu Wang Liming's heart is the vicious American imperialism. For the sake of money, she can sell out the country, the nation, and three generations of ancestors. Since liberation, she has been promoting the "policy of strength" of American imperialism, being loyal to her "confidant" and filial to her "mother." Truly a complete image of a foreign slave!
    There is Xiao Qian in the literary world, and Liu Wang Liming in the women's world. Among other rightists, there is no shortage of people who worship the "money empire" and want to sell the country and become foreign slaves. They committed crimes against the people before liberation, and the people forgave them, but they still haven't changed their slavish nature. Bourgeois elements must undergo "complete remoulding" to reform, and the bones of these foreign slaves must be replaced even more.

    右派分子都有他自己心目中的“知己”。刘王立明是个中国人，但她的“知己”却是美帝国主义。报载，解放前她向她的美国主子领高薪，解放后直到1951年还继续接受美帝国主义每月三百美金的“津贴”。她自己有妈妈，但她嫌她是中国人“不体面”，又去认了一位美国“干妈妈”，干女儿得到的好处是“继承”了遗产约一万美元。
    “有奶便是娘”。刘王立明心目中的“娘”，就是穷凶极恶的美帝国主义。为了金元，什么国家民族，祖宗三代她都可以出卖，解放以来，她一直宣扬美帝国主义的“实力政策”，为她的“知己”尽忠，为她的“娘”尽孝，真是一副十足的洋奴相！
    文艺界有萧乾，妇女界有刘王立明，在其他的右派分子中，崇拜“金元帝国”想卖国做洋奴的也不乏其人。他们在解放前对人民犯了罪，人民宽恕了他们，但他们至今仍奴性不改。资产阶级分子进行改造必须“脱胎换骨”，这些洋奴的骨头更是非换不可。
