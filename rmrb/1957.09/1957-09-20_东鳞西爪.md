　　East Scales, West Claws

　　Mining 20,000 taels of gold
　　Shandong Province is vigorously restoring and developing gold production, with plans to mine 20,000 taels of gold this year.
　　Shandong Province has a wide distribution of gold resources. Rich gold resources are buried in the five special districts of Laiyang, Changwei, Linyi, Tai'an, and Jining. The main gold mining areas in Shandong include six places such as Linglong and Jinniushan, among which the Linglong mining area is known as "daily income of a dou of gold." (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Using wood pulp to make artificial wool
　　Using wood pulp to make artificial wool (i.e., rayon) has been successfully trial-produced at the Tianjin State-owned No. 1 People's Paper Mill.
　　This domestically produced rayon has very strong tensile strength. The flannel and woolen fabric woven with this rayon and pure wool are beautiful, elegant, and of good quality.
　　After adding some equipment, this factory can produce 400,000 pounds of rayon annually, supplying several wool textile factories in Tianjin. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　High-strength alloy steel
　　A manganese-boron carbon high-strength alloy steel suitable for making prestressed reinforced concrete components has been successfully trial-produced at the Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. After being appraised by the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, its performance is excellent.
　　Currently, No. 5 threaded steel is used to make prestressed reinforced concrete components, and the strength of this steel is only 5,000 kilograms per square centimeter. The strength of the high-strength alloy steel recently trial-produced can reach 10,000 kilograms per square centimeter. The cost of the two types of steel is about the same. Replacing No. 5 threaded steel with high-strength alloy steel in prestressed reinforced concrete structures can save more than 50% of steel. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　东鳞西爪
　　开采黄金二万两
    山东省正在大力恢复和发展黄金生产，计划今年开采黄金二万两。
    山东省黄金资源分布很广，在莱阳、昌潍、临沂、泰安和济宁等五个专区都埋藏着丰富的黄金资源。山东主要金矿区有玲珑、金牛山等六处，其中玲珑矿区素有“日进斗金”之称。　（新华社）
　　用木浆做人造毛
    用木浆做人造毛（即人造纤维），已经在天津国营第一人民造纸厂试制成功。
    这种国产人造毛的拉力很强。用这种人造毛和纯毛混纺织成的法兰绒和毛呢，美观大方，质量很好。
    这个工厂增添一些设备以后，能年产四十万磅人造毛，供应天津几家毛纺织厂使用。　（新华社）
　　高强合金钢
    一种适合做预应力钢筋混凝土构件用的锰錋炭素高强合金钢，已在冶金工业部钢铁综合研究所试制成功；经过建筑工程部建筑科学研究院鉴定，它的性能良好。
    目前，做预应力钢筋混凝土构件用的是五号螺纹钢，这种钢的强度每平方公分仅达五千公斤；而最近试制成功的高强合金钢的强度每平方公分能达到一万公斤。两种钢的成本相差无几。在预应力钢筋混凝土结构中用高强合金钢代替五号螺纹钢，能节省钢材50％以上。　（新华社）
