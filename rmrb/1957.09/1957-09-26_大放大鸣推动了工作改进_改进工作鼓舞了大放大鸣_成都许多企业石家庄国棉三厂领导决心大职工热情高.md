Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 25th—One hundred and ten factories and construction enterprises in Chengdu have fully launched the rectification and socialist education movement. In the past week, the workers of these units have set off a high tide of great blooming and debating.

The main forms of blooming and debating in various factories and enterprises are big-character posters and various after-work small-scale discussion meetings. Many factories have specially opened "Blooming and Debating Gardens" and set up writing agencies. Some enterprises have also set up rectification opinion boxes and rectification reception rooms. According to preliminary statistics, in the first few days alone, more than 7,000 big-character posters were posted in various units. The Chengdu Power Plant and Chengdu Lumber Mill, where the movement started earlier, have each posted an average of more than one big-character poster per worker. 90% of the workers in the Yuhua Textile Factory have already spoken at discussion meetings.

The initial situation shows that grasping the side rectification and side correction, and earnestly and quickly dealing with the opinions and suggestions put forward by the workers, is of great significance in boosting workers' morale and eliminating unnecessary concerns. The Yuhua Textile Factory compiles the problems raised by the workers in blooming and debating every day and announces the improvement situation every day. On the second day after the start of blooming and debating, this factory solved the problem of accommodation for family members visiting the factory from afar and purchased protective glasses for workers in the cleaning workshop. On the third day, the number of big-character posters increased from one hundred and six to two hundred and thirty-eight. Workers reflected: Blooming and debating really solves problems.

Before the blooming and debating, all units repeatedly mobilized the workers. Leaders of some units repeatedly expressed their determination to rectify to the masses, explained the significance of rectification through various methods such as discussions and individual conversations, and some also allowed workers to freely choose to participate in any group for study and speeches, which had a very good effect.

In many factories, along with big-character posters, there are also many letters of guarantee and production reports from workers guaranteeing the completion of production tasks. Since the start of rectification, two groups in the Chengdu Copper Wire Factory have broken the factory's historical record for daily output. Workers at the Chengdu Power Plant formulated three covenants to ensure that rectification and production are not delayed, and coal consumption and plant electricity consumption have been significantly reduced. Attendance rates in various units have generally increased, and production is very normal.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 25th—The state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory boldly mobilized workers to engage in great blooming and debating. From the 18th to the 21st, in just four days, workers posted more than 3,400 big-character posters and put forward more than 8,500 criticisms in group meetings.

In order to boldly mobilize workers for great blooming and debating, this factory held six cadre meetings to first correct the cadres' understanding of the rectification movement, and expressed to the workers their determination to correct their mistakes severely and run the enterprise well. The leadership's determination to improve work boosted the enthusiasm of the workers. On the day of the mobilization meeting, the workers expressed their attitude, saying: If the leadership is determined to listen to our opinions, we also have a responsibility to offer opinions, and we must say whatever we have to say, do a good job in rectification, and run our enterprise well. In the group meetings in the following days, the workers spoke very enthusiastically. Except for those who asked for sick leave or personal leave, all workers participated in the meeting, actively engaged in great blooming and debating, and spoke freely.

While mobilizing workers to bloom and debate, the factory's leadership organized personnel to sort out and deal with the problems that emerged from blooming and debating. Forty-one people were responsible for copying the big-character posters, and the classified opinions were printed out every day and distributed to relevant departments for research and processing. The factory also set up four special problem inspection and handling teams according to the nature of the problems. The Party Committee Secretary, factory director, and other responsible cadres went to the big-character poster shed every day to read the big-character posters. The vast majority of cadres can humbly accept criticism. Some cadres automatically copied the criticisms of themselves and their departments from the big-character posters, conducted research, and immediately began to solve those that could be solved immediately. Many workers in the mechanical department posted big-character posters criticizing the leadership for not paying attention to rationalization proposals. The next day, the department director cleared up the backlog of rationalization proposals and approved the adoption of seven rationalization proposals that could be adopted.

Workers are very satisfied with the leadership's side rectification and side correction. They stated: Rectification and blooming and debating are for the purpose of running the enterprise well. We must actively produce during work hours and actively bloom and debate after work hours, and we will never affect production.

    大放大鸣推动了工作改进  改进工作鼓舞了大放大鸣
    成都许多企业石家庄国棉三厂领导决心大职工热情高
    新华社成都25日电　成都市一百一十个工厂和建筑企业单位已经全面展开整风和社会主义教育运动。最近一个星期中，这些单位的职工已经掀起了大鸣大放的高潮。
    各工厂企业鸣、放的主要形式是大字报和各种工余的小型座谈会。许多工厂特别开辟了“鸣放园地”、设立了代书处。有的企业还设立了整风意见箱和整风接待室。据初步统计，只头几天各单位贴出的大字报就在七千张以上。运动开展较早的成都电厂、成都制材厂，目前每个职工平均都已经贴出一张多大字报。裕华纺织厂的职工们90％都已经在座谈会上发了言。
    最初几天的情况表明，抓紧边整边改，认真迅速地处理职工们提出的意见和建议，对鼓舞职工情绪、消除不必要的顾虑有很大意义。裕华纺织厂对职工们鸣放提出的问题都逐日整理，逐日公布改进情况。这个厂在鸣放开始以后的第二天，就解决了有人提出的家属远道探亲来厂的招待住房和为清花车间工人添购保护眼镜等问题。第三天，大字报就从一百零六张增加到二百三十八张。工人们反映：鸣放真解决问题。
    在鸣放以前各单位都反复向职工们进行了动员，有的单位领导方面几次向群众表示整风决心，通过座谈、个别交谈等多种方式阐述整风意义，有的还允许职工们可以自由选择参加任何一个小组学习和发言，收效很好。
    在许多工厂里同大字报一齐出现的还有不少职工们提出的保证完成生产任务的保证书和生产喜报。成都铜线厂有两个小组整风开始以来日产量已经突破全厂历史纪录。成都电厂工人订出三条保证整风生产两不误的公约，煤耗和厂用电都显著降低。各单位出勤率普遍上升，生产十分正常。
    新华社保定25日电　国营石家庄第三棉纺织厂放手发动职工大鸣大放，从18日到21日的四天内，职工们就贴出大字报三千四百多张，并在小组会上提出批评意见八千五百多条。
    这个工厂为了放手发动职工大鸣大放，曾先后召开六次干部会议，首先端正干部对整风运动的认识，并且对工人群众表示狠狠地改正，办好企业的决心。领导改进工作的决心，鼓舞了职工的热情。动员大会的当天，工人们就表示态度说：领导上有决心倾听我们的意见，我们也有责任提意见，一定要有啥说啥，搞好整风，办好我们的企业。以后几天的小组会议，工人发言非常踊跃，除请病假事假的以外，所有工人都参加了会议，积极大鸣大放，畅所欲言。
    这个厂的领导方面一面发动职工鸣放，一面就组织人员整理和处理鸣放出来的问题。有四十一人负责抄录大字报，每天把分类整理的意见打印出来，分发给有关部门研究处理。厂里还按问题性质成立了四个专门检查处理问题的小组。党委书记、厂长等负责干部每天都到大字报棚看大字报。绝大多数干部都能虚心接受批评。有些干部自动抄录大字报上对自己和本部门提出的批评意见，进行研究，对其中能立即解决的即着手解决。机械部许多工人贴出了领导不重视合理化建议的大字报，第二天部主任就把积压的合理化建议进行了清理，并审批采纳了可以采纳的七件合理化建议。
    工人对领导方面边整边改很满意。他们提出：整风鸣放是为了办好企业，我们要上班积极生产，下班积极鸣放，决不影响生产。
