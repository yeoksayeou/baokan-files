Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 8th: "People's Liberty" published on the 7th the resolution of the Central Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on strengthening agricultural production cooperatives politically, economically, and organizationally.

The resolution first stated that last year's counter-revolutionary events interrupted the development of the agricultural production cooperative movement. However, the fact that most of the destroyed cooperatives have been re-established after the events shows that the Hungarian agricultural collectivization movement is basically healthy and vital.

The resolution believes that the main task in the future is to strengthen the cooperatives politically, economically, and organizationally.

The resolution emphasized that it is necessary to widely publicize the necessity of the socialist transformation of agriculture, to give necessary attention to advanced agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time to pay attention to the initial forms of the cooperative movement and to implement the principle of voluntarism.

The resolution put forward some basic principles for the work of cooperatives: all means of production and livestock, except for legal private plots and necessary livestock, are collectively owned by the members; collective labor in all work departments; the basic income of the cooperative is distributed according to labor days; a minimum of 5% of the total income must be used as the cooperative's public accumulation fund; members jointly decide and carry out purchasing and sales activities; annual production and investment budget plans are formulated; members are educated in the socialist spirit.

The resolution stated that the state only helps cooperatives that work according to the above principles. Attention must be paid to ensuring that the new loan system is not used to directly increase the income of members, but to improve the production work of the cooperatives.

The resolution stated that raising the commodity production of cooperatives should be taken as a principle for strengthening cooperatives, and in the future, the state's assistance to cooperatives will only be used to help improve the commodity production of cooperatives. (Attached picture)

    匈牙利工人党通过决议
    加强农业生产合作社
    据新华社布达佩斯8日电 “人民自由报”7日登载了匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局关于在政治、经济和组织上加强农业生产合作社的决议。
    决议首先说，去年反革命事件打断了农业生产合作运动的发展。但是，事件后大部分被破坏了的合作社已经重新建立起来这一事实，说明了匈牙利农业合作化运动基本上是健康的和有生命力的。
    决议认为今后主要的任务是从政治上、经济上和组织上加强合作社。
    决议强调，应该广泛宣传农业社会主义改造的必要性，对高级农业合作社给以必要的注意，同时注意合作运动的初级形式和贯彻自愿原则。
    决议提出了合作社工作的一些基本原则：除了合法的自留地和必要的牲口外，一切生产资料和牲口归社员公共所有；在一切工作部门中共同劳动；合作社的基本收入按劳动日分配；最低限度必须以总收入的5％作为合作社公积金；社员共同决定和进行购买和销售活动；每年制订生产和投资预算计划；用社会主义精神教育社员。
    决议说，国家只帮助按照上述原则进行工作的合作社。必须注意使新的贷款制度不是用来直接提高社员的收入，而是用来提高合作社的生产工作。
    决议说，应该以提高合作社的商品生产作为加强合作社的原则，将来国家对合作社的帮助也只是用来帮助提高合作社的商品生产。（附图片）
