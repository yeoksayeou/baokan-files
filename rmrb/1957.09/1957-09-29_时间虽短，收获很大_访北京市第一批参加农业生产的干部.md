I recently visited the first batch of forty-three cadres from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee who were sent to the countryside to participate in production. After more than half a month of labor, each of them had a dark complexion, was in good spirits, and very talkative. When asked about the gains from their labor, they all said in unison: Though the time was short, the gains were great. The young men couldn't help but take out their work point record books and say, "Look! We've already earned the same work points as the farmers."

On September 2nd, they came to the Xishan Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Haidian District of Beijing and began to eat, live, and work alongside the farmers. This cooperative mainly consisted of vegetable fields, with a portion dedicated to autumn crops. For those who had never done physical labor or had been away from it for a long time, the first difficulty encountered in participating in field labor was how to overcome physical limitations and unfamiliarity. During a casual conversation, I found that each of them had shown great perseverance in overcoming this difficulty, especially some of the older cadres and female cadres. The vast majority of them never complained. When I inquired further about their labor, they all told me about the joy after labor, eating more, eating better, sleeping well, and feeling good!

"Coming to the countryside has strengthened and clarified our class standpoint," a cadre who had been working since 1939 told me. "In the countryside, you can't handle a problem or say a word without a clear class standpoint, or you'll be wrong." The township is currently conducting a socialist education movement, and the cadres sent down to produce are paying close attention to this. One female comrade told me about a meeting she attended. At that meeting, a farmer complained that the cooperative was not good, saying that the grain was taken away by the state. An old farmer named Liu Zhi immediately stood up angrily and said to that farmer: "The cooperative is not good? How is it not good! Think about how many meals of rice and white flour you ate before? The state buying grain is the same as us buying grain ourselves. As long as you stand with Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, you are the state." The female comrade said: I was very moved by Liu Zhi's words, and I felt that my class stand was not as sensitive and firm as that of this old farmer.

The farmers' simple and excellent qualities greatly impressed some cadres who were accustomed to the ways of intellectuals. One cadre said: The second day we arrived, the farmers directly helped us with our work, saying directly, "So-and-so, you do that, so-and-so, you do this," and pointing out our mistakes immediately. At first, we were not used to this, but thinking about it slowly, it's much better than the ways of intellectuals! In the office, even when conducting criticism and self-criticism, you have to beat around the bush.

Once, during a meal, a cadre picked up the rice grains that had fallen on the table and ate them, saying to me: "I used to be like this in the office, but now I pay even more attention." Then another cadre also said: "Yes, a grain of rice or a cabbage is hard-earned!"

During the interviews, I heard such words more than once. One day, near noon, I went to a vegetable field to interview a female cadre who was participating in labor. She sat on the ridge of the field and said to me: "It's much easier to eat a cabbage, but it's very difficult to grow!" She pointed to the vegetable field and said: "It's dry, and it's hard to hoe the vegetables. Using a hoe to break the soil makes a loud sound, and even your head hurts. From planting vegetables to eating vegetables, how much blood and sweat does it take!" In another conversation, a young man told me about something. Once, he and an old farmer drove a cart to load sorghum. After the sorghum was loaded, the farmer disappeared. Looking up, he was in the field looking for scattered ears of grain. The young man said: After more than half a month of labor, I deeply realized why that old farmer cherished his labor so much.

Cadres going down to participate in agricultural production and become ordinary farmers has also had a great impact on this cooperative. Middle and high school graduates who lived in the countryside but did not get into school are now settling down to participate in agricultural production. Some cooperative cadres who did not participate in actual production much before have now changed. The agricultural cooperative members initially had a skeptical attitude towards these cadres, but now they are slowly changing. Some said: "It's good that you're doing this, you've tasted all the joys and hardships, you know how crops grow and how they're harvested, and you'll be able to do a much better job in the future!" They began to treat these cadres as their own people, and told these cadres in casual conversations during labor the opinions that they were unwilling to express at the meetings where they were giving full expression of views in the countryside. In the evenings, some cadres' residences became lively, with young and old farmers coming to visit, talking and laughing with these cadres.

During the interviews, many cadres told reporters that although they had gained these things in more than half a month of labor, they still had to overcome many difficulties to truly integrate with the farmers in terms of their ideology, work style, and living habits. The reporter saw that some cadres had already begun to pay attention to this issue. They believed that the main purpose of coming down to labor was to transform their own ideology, work style, and living habits through labor, truly eat, live, and work with the farmers, truly become friends with the farmers, and have a close emotional connection with the farmers, settling down in the countryside. However, some cadres were not yet fully clear about this issue, and were still accustomed to the office's work schedule. Although they could work with the farmers during labor, they were still accustomed to walking and talking with a few familiar people during rest after labor, and had not been able to actively integrate with the farmers. But it can be believed that they will gradually change this phenomenon in their labor.

### 时间虽短，收获很大  访北京市第一批参加农业生产的干部

    时间虽短，收获很大
    访北京市第一批参加农业生产的干部
    新华社记者　张新辰
    记者最近访问了北京市人民委员会第一批下放到农村参加生产的四十三个干部。经过半个多月的劳动，他们个个脸色紫黑，精神愉快，非常健谈。谈到劳动的收获，异口同声地说：时间虽短，收获很大。小伙子们情不自禁地拿出记工簿说：“瞧！我们已经得到和农民一样的工分了。”
    9月2日他们来到了北京市海淀区西山乡农业生产合作社后，就和农民同吃、同住、同劳动。这个合作社大部分是菜田，也有一部分是大秋作物。对于从来没有或者已经长期脱离体力劳动的人来说，参加田间劳动首先遇到的困难，就是如何克服体力的不够和不习惯。在闲谈中，我发现他们每个人在克服这个困难中，都表示了很大的毅力，尤其是一些年纪较大的干部和妇女干部。绝大部分人从来没有因此叫苦。当我再详细询问劳动情况时，他们都告诉我劳动以后的愉快，饭吃多了，香了，睡好了，精神愉快了！
      “来到农村后，锻炼和明确了我们的阶级观点”，一位从1939年就参加工作的干部这样对我说：“在农村中你处理一个问题，谈一句话，阶级观点非明确不行，不然就错了。”这个乡正在进行社会主义教育运动，下来生产的干部们对这非常注意，有位女同志和我谈起了她参加的一次会议。在那次会议上，有个农民抱怨合作社不好，说粮食打了给国家买去了。一个叫刘志的老农民，立刻气呼呼地站起来，对那个农民说：“合作社不好，怎么不好！你想想看你以前吃过几顿大米白面的？国家买粮食也就是我们自己买粮食，你只要和毛主席、共产党站在一起，你就是国家。”那位女同志说：我听了刘志的话，心里很感动，感到自己的阶级立场就没有这位老农民这样敏感和定坚。
    农民朴实的优良品质使得一些习惯于知识分子一套的干部们的感触很大。有位干部说：我们来了第二天，农民们就直捷了当地帮助我们工作，一开口就是某某你去做那个，某某你做这个，做错了当时就指出。一开始对这不习惯，但慢慢想来比知识分子那一套好得多啦！在机关里连开展批评自我批评，也要转弯抹角的。
    有次在吃饭时，一位干部一面将掉在桌上饭粒捡起来吃，一面对我说：“以前我在机关里就是这样，现在更加注意了。”接着另外一位干部也说：是的，一粒米、一棵白菜来自不易啊！
    在访问中，我不止一次地听到这样的话。一天将近中午时光，我到一块菜田里去访问一位参加劳动的女干部，她坐在田埂上，对我说：“吃一棵白菜，容易得多，种起来可困难啊！”她指着那块菜田说：天干，耪菜时好不容易，用锄耪土，一耪哗哗响，连脑袋都震得痛。从种菜到吃菜，中间要花去多少血汗！另一次谈话中一个小伙子同我谈起了一件事情。有次他和一个老农民赶着大车去装高粱，高粱装完了这个农民不见了，抬头一看，他在田里找散落的穗子。这位小伙子说：经过半个多月的劳动，我才深刻地体会到那位老农民为什么那样爱惜自己劳动成果。
    干部下放参加农业生产，做一个普通农民，对这个合作社也有很大的影响。家住农村没有考上学校的中小学毕业生，安心参加农业生产了，有的社干部原来不大参加实际生产的现在也改变了。农业社社员们起初对这批干部抱有怀疑的态度，现在慢慢改变了，有的说：你们这样干是好样儿，酸甜苦辣都尝过，知道庄稼怎样长的怎样收的，以后做起工作来就好得多了！他们开始把这些干部当作自己人看待，在农村大鸣大放的会议上不愿谈出的意见，在劳动中闲谈时告诉这些干部。晚上，有些干部的住所热闹起来，年青的年老的农民都来串门，他们和这些干部有说有笑。
    在访问中，许多干部告诉记者，在半个多月的劳动中，虽然有这些收获；但是要真正从自己思想作风和生活习惯上和农民打成一片，还是要克服许多困难。记者看到一些干部已开始注意这个问题，他们认为下来劳动的主要目的在于通过劳动，改造自己思想作风和生活习惯，真正和农民同吃同住同劳动，真正做农民朋友，和农民的感情息息相通，在农村中安家落户。但是也有一些干部对这一问题还不完全明确，还习惯于机关的上下班制度，在劳动时他们虽能和农民在一起劳动，但是在劳动后休息时，还习惯于几个相熟的人在一起散步、谈心，还没有能积极主动地和农民打成一片。但是可以相信，他们在劳动中将会逐步改变这种现象的。
