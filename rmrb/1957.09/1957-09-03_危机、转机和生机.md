Crisis, Turning Point, and Vitality
Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy

    The People's Daily published an editorial entitled "The Serious Tasks of the Democratic Parties." This editorial, with its powerful persuasive force, concisely described the activities of right-wing elements within the democratic parties, profoundly analyzed the historical and social roots of the struggle between the two paths within the democratic parties, affirmed the class nature of the democratic parties in the current situation, explained in detail the urgency and necessity of the essential transformation of the democratic parties from bourgeois parties to socialist parties, and clearly pointed out the historical tasks and current serious political tasks of the democratic parties in the stage of socialist revolution. We believe that the People's Daily editorial is the Chinese Communist Party's care, encouragement, spur, and supervision of the democratic parties, and also a profound education for the democratic parties and their members. On behalf of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, I endorse the full spirit of the People's Daily editorial. I call on the members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy to bravely accept the severe historical test of the socialist revolution with the strongest revolutionary determination and unparalleled revolutionary perseverance, so that the China Association for Promoting Democracy can successfully pass this test, gain political vitality, and become a political force that truly serves socialism.

    The entire history of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution proves that without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, without the Chinese Communist Party's timely indication of the political direction at crucial historical junctures, the democratic parties cannot exist and develop, and cannot make any beneficial contributions to the Chinese people or the revolutionary cause. The existence and development of any political party, the continuation and strengthening of its political vitality, depends on whether the political line of this party conforms to the objective laws of social and historical development, and whether it conforms to the interests of the broad masses of the people. The Chinese Communist Party is a great political party standing at the pinnacle of history, guiding the historical trend forward, representing the highest, long-term, and overall interests of the Chinese people. Therefore, the sincere acceptance of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party by the democratic parties coincides with the interests of the people, enables them to gain the trust of the people, and enables them to have something to rely on and something to accomplish. Conversely, deviating from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party runs counter to the interests of the people, will be spurned by the people, and will leave them with nothing to rely on and nothing to accomplish. The people are the creators of history, and the people are the ultimate appraisers of history. The fair conclusion made by the Chinese people on the democratic parties in 1949, fundamentally speaking, is the full trust expressed by the Chinese people in the Chinese Communist Party. Based on the history of long-term revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people choose and trust the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; similarly, based on history, the Chinese people trust and support all the democratic parties under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no democratic parties: this is a historical conclusion that no one can overturn. This conclusion is completely true for the entire history of the emergence, growth, and development of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and it is also completely true for other democratic parties.

    However, things are moving forward, and history is developing. After achieving the complete victory of the democratic revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people also achieved the decisive victory of the socialist revolution to transform the ownership of the means of production. The developing history requires the democratic parties to continue to move forward, and requires the democratic parties to leap from the political standpoint of the democratic revolution to the political standpoint of the socialist revolution. However, judging from the overall class basis of the democratic parties, from their main political tendencies, and from the ideological system of the vast majority of their members, that is to say, judging from the overall aspect, the democratic parties are still bourgeois parties at present, and have not yet become political forces that truly serve socialism. Pointing out such an objective fact may make some people feel emotionally uncomfortable and resistant. However, pointing this out makes it possible for us to calmly and seriously observe, measure, and weigh ourselves and our organizations with the scientific method of class analysis, and makes us clearly aware that there is a huge contradiction before us—the contradiction between the bourgeois nature of the parties and the requirements of the objective situation of socialism, and there is a not-small distance—the distance between the ideological awareness of the democratic revolution and the ideological awareness of the socialist revolution. Therefore, it will also make us keenly feel that, in order to overcome this huge contradiction and shorten this not-small distance, our members and our organizations must catch up quickly, carry out fundamental transformation, and carry out essential transformation from bourgeois parties to socialist parties.

    The People's Daily editorial points out that the historical task of the democratic parties is to conduct socialist education among the strata and people they represent and are connected with, promote and help them carry out socialist self-transformation, and at the same time represent their interests that follow the laws of historical development. The current serious political task of the democratic parties is to carry out a widespread and in-depth rectification movement centered on the anti-rightist struggle. We believe that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, standing firm on the socialist stand, successfully completing the current serious political task, and firmly implementing their own historical tasks, can the democratic parties achieve "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the Chinese Communist Party on the socialist political basis.

    The China Association for Promoting Democracy has only eleven years of history from its establishment to the present. These eleven years are precisely the great era in which the Chinese revolution has entered a climax and achieved successive victories. This should be said to be a relatively smooth objective condition for the growth and development of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. But it is precisely because of this that the China Association for Promoting Democracy has not experienced severe historical tests and profound political training. Within the China Association for Promoting Democracy, in the stage of the democratic revolution, the division of left and right political forces has already been shown; in the stage of the socialist revolution, this political division has developed in a more profound direction, becoming a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. This struggle was latent and internal in the past, and we did not have the opportunity or the time to put it on the table for a major debate on right and wrong, so on the surface it presented a state of "peaceful coexistence." Now, an important historical moment has arrived, and at this historical moment, the China Association for Promoting Democracy is required to fundamentally solve the question of who will win and who will lose between the two political lines. Where is the China Association for Promoting Democracy going? It depends on the final outcome of the struggle between these two political lines.

    More than 70% of the members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy are teachers in primary and secondary schools, that is to say, our association is basically a team composed of bourgeois intellectuals today. We should have enough estimation for this. If we think that most of our members are "small intellectuals" and the problem is not big, ignoring the class basis and class characteristics of our team, and thus relaxing the anti-rightist struggle and relaxing self-transformation, then we will make an unforgivable mistake in politics. The revealed facts show that the criminal activities of right-wing elements are serious in the central and many grassroots organizations of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the capitalist thoughts and emotions of most members are also serious, and the errors and shortcomings in the organizational line and political and ideological work of our association are also serious. Faced with such a situation, we deeply feel ashamed of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and we are in a heavy mood of guilt and sin. However, we are not pessimistic. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the leftists within the China Association for Promoting Democracy, uniting and educating the middle-of-the-roaders to move to the left, and resolutely struggling against the rightists within the association, we will definitely be able to enable the socialist political line to achieve a decisive victory within the China Association for Promoting Democracy. We firmly believe that the China Association for Promoting Democracy will quickly end the state of political chaos, overcome the crisis, completely defeat the rightist attack, seize the turning point, and then gain vigorous vitality, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, dedicate its own strength to the socialist cause wholeheartedly and without reservation.

    危机、转机和生机
    中国民主促进会主席  马叙伦
    人民日报发表了“各民主党派的严重任务”的社论。这篇社论以强大的说服力量，扼要地叙述了各民主党派内部右派分子活动的情况，深刻地分析了各民主党派内部两条道路斗争的历史根源和社会根源，肯定地论证了各民主党派在目前状况下的阶级性质，详细地阐释了各民主党派由资产阶级政党到社会主义政党的本质改造的迫切和必要，明确地指出了各民主党派在社会主义革命阶段的历史任务和当前的严重政治任务。我们认为，人民日报社论是中国共产党对各民主党派的爱护、鼓舞、鞭策和督促，也是对各民主党派及其成员的深刻教育。我代表中国民主促进会，拥护人民日报社论的全部精神。我号召中国民主促进会的会员，以最坚强的革命决心和无比的革命毅力，勇敢地接受社会主义革命的严重的历史考验，使中国民主促进会能够胜利地通过这次考验，取得政治上的生命力，成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。
    民主主义革命和社会主义革命的全部历史证明：没有中国共产党的领导，没有中国共产党在紧要的历史关头及时地指明政治方向，各民主党派就不能够存在和发展，就不能够为中国人民、为革命事业作出任何有益的事情。一切政党的存在和发展，它的政治生命力的延续和加强，取决于这个政党的政治路线是否符合于社会历史发展的客观规律，是否符合于广大人民的利益。中国共产党是站在历史顶端、正面指导历史潮流往前发展的伟大政党，它代表着中国人民的最高的、长远的、全体的利益。因此，各民主党派真诚地接受中国共产党的领导，就和人民利益吻合，就能得到人民的信任，就能有所依靠，有所作为；反之，脱离了中国共产党的领导，就和人民的利益背道而驰，就会遭到人民的唾弃，就会无所依靠，无所作为。人民是历史的创造者，人民是历史的最终鉴定者。1949年，中国人民对各民主党派所作的公允的结论，从根本上来讲，是中国人民对中国共产党所表示的充分信赖。中国人民根据长期革命斗争的历史，选择和信赖中国共产党的正确领导；同样，中国人民根据历史，信赖和支持所有在中国共产党领导之下的各个民主党派。没有中国共产党的领导，就没有各民主党派：这是一个任谁也不能推翻的历史结论。这个结论，对于中国民主促进会的产生、成长和发展的全部历史来讲是完全真实的，对于其他各民主党派来讲也是完全真实的。
    但是，事物在前进，历史在发展。中国人民在取得民主主义革命的彻底胜利之后，在中国共产党领导之下，又取得了变革生产资料所有制的社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。发展着的历史，要求各民主党派继续前进，要求各民主党派从民主主义革命的政治立场跃进到社会主义革命的政治立场。然而，就各民主党派总的阶级基础来看，就它的主要的政治倾向来看，就它的绝大多数成员的思想体系来看，也就是说，就总的方面来看，各民主党派现时还是资产阶级性的政党，还没有成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。指出这样一个客观存在的事实，可能令一些人情绪上不痛快，发生抵触。但是，指出这一点，使我们有可能冷静地、严肃地用阶级分析的科学方法来观察、测量、衡度我们自己和我们的组织，使我们清醒地知道，在我们面前，摆着一个巨大的矛盾——资产阶级性政党和社会主义客观形势要求之间的矛盾，横着一段不小的距离——民主主义革命的思想觉悟和社会主义革命的思想觉悟之间的距离。因而，也就会使我们痛切感到，要克服这个巨大的矛盾，缩短这段不小的距离，我们的成员和我们的组织必须急起直追，进行根本的改造，进行由资产阶级政党到社会主义政党的本质上的改造。
    人民日报社论指出，各民主党派的历史任务，是要向他们所代表和联系的阶层和人民，进行社会主义教育，推动和帮助他们进行社会主义的自我改造；同时代表他们遵循历史发展规律的利益。各民主党派当前的严重政治任务，则是进行普遍深入的以反右派斗争为中心内容的整风运动。我们认为，只有在中国共产党的领导下，站稳社会主义立场，胜利地完成当前的严重政治任务，坚定地执行自己的历史任务，各民主党派才能够在社会主义的政治基础上做到和中国共产党“长期共存，互相监督”。
    中国民主促进会从成立到现在，还只有十一年的历史。这十一年，正是中国革命步入高潮并取得节节胜利的伟大时代。这对中国民主促进会的成长和发展，应当说是一个较为顺利的客观条件。但也正因为如此，中国民主促进会不曾经受严峻的历史考验和深刻的政治锻炼。在中国民主促进会内部，在民主主义革命阶段，就已经显示出左、右派政治力量的分野；在社会主义革命阶段，这种政治分野向更深刻的方向发展，成为社会主义、资本主义两条道路之间的斗争。这种斗争过去是潜伏内孕着的，我们没有机会、也来不及把它摆到桌面上来进行大是大非的辩论，因而在表面上就呈现一种“和平共处”的状态。现在，已经临到了一个重要的历史时刻，在这个历史时刻，要求中国民主促进会从根本上解决两条政治路线谁胜谁负的问题。中国民主促进会往何处去？取决于这两条政治路线的斗争的最终结局。
    中国民主促进会的成员，有70％以上是中小学校教师，也就是说，我们的会，在今天基本上还是资产阶级知识分子所组成的队伍。对于这一点，我们应当有足够的估计。如果以为我们的成员大多是“小知识分子”，问题不大，忽略我们队伍的阶级基础和阶级特性，因而放松了反右派斗争，放松了自我改造，那么，我们就要在政治上犯不可饶恕的错误。已经揭露的事实表明：在中国民主促进会的中央和许多基层组织，右派分子的罪恶活动是严重的，大多数成员的资本主义思想和情绪也是严重的，我们会的组织路线和政治思想工作中的错误和缺点也是严重的。面对着这样的情况，我们深感愧对中国共产党和中国人民，我们怀着内疚负罪的沉重心情。但是，我们并不悲观。我们坚定地相信，在中国共产党的领导下，依靠中国民主促进会内的左派，团结和教育中间派向左走，向会内的右派进行坚决斗争，我们就一定能使社会主义政治路线在中国民主促进会内取得决定性的胜利。我们坚定地相信，中国民主促进会将迅速结束政治上的混乱状态，克服危机；彻底打垮右派的进攻，夺取转机；然后获得力量充沛的生机，在中国共产党的领导下，为社会主义事业死心蹋地地毫无保留地贡献出自己的力量。
