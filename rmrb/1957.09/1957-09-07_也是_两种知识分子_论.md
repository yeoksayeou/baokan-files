Intellectuals are not an independent class. Every class needs them and tries its best to win them over to serve its cause. They become a stratum of that class by serving that class. Therefore, in a multi-class society, there are several kinds of intellectuals. In old China, they were educated by and served the feudal class or the bourgeoisie. Therefore, Chinese intellectuals were basically feudal or bourgeois intellectuals; however, their ideological situations were not completely the same. Especially in the era of transition between the old and new societies, their ideological differentiation became particularly drastic.

Among the intellectuals of old China, there were some who were good at distinguishing right from wrong, "worrying about the world's troubles before anyone else, and enjoying its pleasures only after everyone else," and "taking the world as their responsibility." Although such intellectuals often started from the standpoint of the exploiting classes because of their origins in the exploiting classes or their education by the exploiting classes, when they saw that the emerging oppressed classes or the people of the oppressed nations had awakened, and the old ruling classes could no longer rule as before, some of these people with such ideals were able to break away from the old ruling classes before the transformation and join the emerging classes, becoming enlighteners or pioneers of the new society; or during or after the transformation, they continuously turned to the new society and became supporters and eulogizers of the new society and the new system.

However, among the intellectuals of old China, there were also those who did not have a trace of "people's character" in them, whose thinking was rigid, who resolutely defended the interests of the vested classes, and who stubbornly refused to let go of the old social system; some would even willingly become martyrs of the old system after its collapse; or stubbornly refused to cooperate with the new society, "disdaining to eat Zhou grain," and unwilling to "submit." Such people were the so-called "royalists" and "restorationists."

These are two extremes. Most people are in an intermediate state between the two extremes. Before the transformation, they were dissatisfied with the old society but afraid of major changes; after the transformation, they had already served the new system but were not accustomed to it. Such people, under the general trend and after a certain period of education, are able to sever their emotional ties with the old society and become accustomed to the living system of the new society; some can even gradually raise their awareness and work hard for the cause of the new society. For such people, the new society will "not hold old grudges and use various methods to help" them progress, and even adopt a welcoming attitude towards their slightest progress. What is worth noting is that a group of "royalists" and "restorationists" are mixed among them. These conspirators were still scolding the enlighteners or pioneers of the new society as "rioters" and "traitors" yesterday, but after the new society was "founded," they pretended to be "loyal" supporters of the new society, clamoring for "rule of law." If these people can truly break away from the "royalists" and "restorationists" and sincerely help the new society "legislate" to stabilize and consolidate the order of the new society, this is also needed by the new society and should be welcomed by the new society, and they will not be discriminated against because they were scolding "rioters" and "traitors" yesterday. Some gentlemen used to ride on the heads of the people and lead extravagant lives yesterday, but today they dress up as "knights" who "plead for the people," clamoring about "the people's poor lives." If these people can truly "redeem their sins to the people" and reflect and explain their sins and situations from the people's standpoint, this is also needed by the new society and should be welcomed by the new society, and they will not be denied the opportunity to "redeem their sins" to the people because they have done many evils in the past. The problem, however, lies in their turning black and white upside down, confusing right and wrong, attempting to provoke the relationship between the masses of the people and the People's Government, and using the "rule of law" as a cover to traffic in private goods, conspiring to change the nature of the new system, allowing the old system to "return from the dead," so as to facilitate the "restoration" of the old rulers! But they refuse to confess, and this is their own dead end.

    也是“两种知识分子”论
    克约
    知识分子不是一个独立的阶级，每一个阶级都不可缺少他们，都在竭力争取他们为其服务。他们为那个阶级服务，就成为那个阶级的一个阶层。因此，在多阶级的社会里，是有几种知识分子的。在旧中国，他们是受着封建阶级或资产阶级的教养，并为其服务的，因此，中国的知识分子基本上是封建阶级的或资产阶级的知识分子；但他们的思想情况也并不完全一致的。特别是在新旧社会交替的时代里，他们的思想分化也特别来得剧烈。
    旧中国的知识分子中是有这样一种人的，他们善于明辨大是大非，“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”，“以天下为己任”。这种知识分子，虽因他们出身于剥削阶级或者是受剥削阶级的教育，往往是从剥削阶级的立场出发；但当他们一看到新兴的被压迫阶级或被压迫民族的人民大众有了觉醒，旧的统治阶级又不能照旧统治下去的时候，有这样怀抱的人，有的人是能在变革之先就从旧的统治阶级中分化出来，归附于新兴的阶级，而成为新社会的启蒙者或先行者的；或者是在变革的过程中或变革以后，陆陆续续地投向新社会方面来，而成为新社会与新制度的拥护者与讴歌者。
    可是，在旧中国的知识分子中却还有这样一种人，从他们身上丝毫找不出一点儿“人民性”，思想僵化，坚决维护既得阶级的利益，死守着旧社会制度不放手；甚至当旧社会崩溃以后，有的还会甘心成为旧制度的殉葬者；或者顽固地不同新社会合作，“耻食周粟”，不愿“臣服”。这样的人，就是所谓“保皇党”与“复辟派”。
    这是两个极端。多数人是处于两极之间的中间状态。在变革之前，他们既不满旧社会，又害怕大的变革；在变革之后，他们既已为新制度服务，又对于新制度不习惯。这样的人，在大势所趋的条件下，又经过一定时间的教育，他们是能割断同旧社会的感情联系，而习惯于新社会的生活制度的；他们有的还能逐渐提高其觉悟，积极为新社会的事业而辛勤工作。对于这样的人，新社会是会“不念旧恶，用各种办法帮助”他们进步，甚至对他们的点滴进步也会采取欢迎态度。值得注意的，是他们中间混杂了一部分“保皇党”与“复辟派”的人，这些阴谋家在昨天还在大骂新社会的启蒙者或先行者为“暴民”，为“叛逆”，而在新社会“奠基”以后却伪装出一副对新社会是一个“忠心耿耿”的拥护者，大嚷其“法治”；如果这些人真能从“保皇党”与“复辟派”中分化出来，诚心诚意帮助新社会“立法”，以稳定和巩固新社会的秩序，这对新社会也是需要的，当为新社会所欢迎，并不会因他们昨天还在骂“暴民”骂“叛逆”，就予以歧视。有些先生们在昨天还骑在人民的头上过着骄奢淫佚的生活，而在今天却装扮成一个“为民请命”的“骑士”，大嚷什么“人民生活不好”；如果这些人真能“向人民赎罪”，站在人民的立场来反映交代自己的罪恶和情况，这对新社会也是需要的，也当为新社会所欢迎，并不会因他们过去作恶多端，就不让其有向人民“赎罪”的机会。问题却在于他们颠倒黑白，混淆是非，企图挑拨人民群众同人民政府的关系，在“法治”这个幌子的掩护下贩运私货，阴谋使新制度变质，旧制度“借尸还魂”，而便于旧的统治者的“复辟”！但是他们却又拒不交代，这就是他们自寻绝路了。
