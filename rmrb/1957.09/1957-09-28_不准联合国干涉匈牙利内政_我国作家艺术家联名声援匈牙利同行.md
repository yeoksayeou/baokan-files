Xinhua News Agency, 27th. One hundred and thirty-three prominent Chinese writers and artists have signed a protest against the illegal act of the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, in placing the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda of the UN General Assembly.

The full text of the protest is as follows:

"The protest issued on September 5th by one hundred and twenty-seven Hungarian writers regarding the inclusion of the so-called 'Hungarian Question' on the agenda of the UN General Assembly is just and forceful. We—Chinese writers and artists—unanimously and resolutely support this just action by the Hungarian writers.

When, between October and November last year, the restoration plot of a small group of counter-revolutionary elements in Hungary, incited and supported by imperialism, met with a shameful defeat, the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, established a so-called 'Five-Person Committee' to unreasonably interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. Recently, just as the United States is actively invading the Middle East and obstructing disarmament negotiations, the United States is once again using the United Nations to cover up these conspiracies, divert attention, and forcibly include the so-called 'Hungarian Question' on the General Assembly's agenda, attempting to once again stir up anti-Soviet and anti-communist clamor. We believe that this is an unreasonable interference in Hungary's internal affairs and an illegal act produced under the voting machine manipulated by the United States. This resolution will only be spurned by the people of the world, and it cannot harm Hungary's people's democratic system in the slightest, just as the United Nations' continued refusal to include the issue of restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations on the agenda also cannot harm the existence of the People's Republic of China in the slightest.

Chinese writers and artists stand together with Hungarian writers and artists, as well as progressive writers and artists from around the world, to resolutely protest this illegal act and will not allow imperialists to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs!"

The protest was signed by Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Ba Jin, Lao She, Shao Quanlin, Xiao San, Tian Han, Mei Lanfang, Cao Yu, Yuan Muzhi, Cai Chusheng, Lü Ji, Ye Qianyu, Wu Zuoren, Cai Ruohong, Wu Xiaobang, and one hundred and thirty-three others.

    不准联合国干涉匈牙利内政
    我国作家艺术家联名声援匈牙利同行
    新华社27日讯　中国著名文学家、艺术家一百三十三人签名抗议联合国在美国操纵下把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联合国大会议程的非法行为。
    抗议书全文如下：
    “9月5日匈牙利一百二十七位作家对于联合国把所谓‘匈牙利问题’列入联合国大会议程所发表的抗议，义正词严。我们——中国的作家和艺术家们一致坚决地支持匈牙利作家们这一正义的行动。
    当去年10月—11月间，匈牙利一小撮反革命分子在帝国主义的煽动、支持之下所进行的复辟阴谋遭到可耻的失败的时候，联合国在美国操纵之下，成立所谓‘五人委员会’，对匈牙利内政进行无理干涉。最近，正当美国积极侵略中东、阻挠裁军谈判的时候，美国又利用联合国替他遮掩这些阴谋，转移视线，硬把所谓‘匈牙利问题’列入大会议程，妄图再一次掀起反苏反共的叫嚣。我们认为这是对匈牙利内政的无理干涉，是在美国操纵的表决机器下产生的非法行为。这项决议只有为全世界人民所唾弃，而决不能丝毫损害匈牙利的人民民主制度，正同联合国至今还拒绝把恢复中国在联合国的合法地位问题列入议程，也丝毫不能损害中华人民共和国的存在一样。
    中国作家和艺术家们和匈牙利作家们以及全世界进步的作家艺术家们站在一起，坚决抗议这种非法的行为，不允许帝国主义者干涉匈牙利的内政！”
    在抗议书上签名的有郭沫若、茅盾、周扬、巴金、老舍、邵荃麟、萧三、田汉、梅兰芳、曹禺、袁牧之、蔡楚生、吕骥、叶浅予、吴作人、蔡若虹、吴晓邦等一百三十三人。
