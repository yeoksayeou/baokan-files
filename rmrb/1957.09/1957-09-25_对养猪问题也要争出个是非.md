Behind-the-Scenes Notes

    On the Issue of Pig Raising, a Clear Distinction Must Be Made

    After the extensive debate on the grain issue, the blatant rhetoric against the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain has once again gone bankrupt. Some farmers who once wasted grain extravagantly now also admit that grain must be conserved. However, have everyone's thoughts been completely straightened out? Some people's thinking is genuinely clear, while others' may not be entirely so. On certain specific issues, their thoughts may still have resistance. For example, there is currently debate on the issue of pig raising. Some people believe that in order to raise more pigs, more grain must be reserved, and more staple grains such as rice must be kept; otherwise, they will have to sell or slaughter the pigs they are currently raising! Others who support the unified purchase and sale of grain oppose this argument that "raising pigs and conserving grain are contradictory."

    Can't we conserve grain while raising more pigs? Can't we raise a large number of pigs while conserving grain? This question is indeed worth debating. If a clear distinction is not made on this issue, some people who harbor dissatisfaction with the unified purchase and sale of grain may use the excuse of reserving more pig feed to coerce the state into purchasing less grain and selling more; they may also use the excuse of conserving grain to adopt a passive and retreating attitude towards developing pig production. Both of these situations are undoubtedly detrimental to the country and the farmers themselves.

    Striving to conserve grain while vigorously developing pig production is the requirement of the state. Can this be done at all? How can it be done? Have those who are clamoring that "there is no feed to feed the pigs" made full use of the self-retained land mainly for planting feed crops? Have they made full use of local feed resources? These should all be clarified. Many agricultural cooperatives in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, have reached correct conclusions on the issue of pig raising and grain conservation through debate. Agricultural cooperatives in other places should also launch debates on similar issues and draw correct conclusions based on a large number of facts and experiences at that time and place.

### 对养猪问题也要争出个是非

    对养猪问题也要争出个是非
    在开展粮食问题大辩论以后，那种嚣张的反对统购统销政策的言论，已经又一次破产了，某些曾经大肆浪费粮食的农民，现在也承认必须节约粮食了。但是，是不是所有的人思想都完全通了呢？有些人的思想真的通了，另一些人思想未必真通，在某些具体问题上，他们的思想还可能有抵触。比如，目前在养猪问题上，就有争论。有人认为，要想多养猪，就得多留粮食，而且要多留稻谷等主粮；否则就只好把正在喂养着的猪卖掉或杀掉！而另外一些拥护统购统销的人则反对这种“养猪和节约粮食有矛盾”的论调。
    多养猪就不能节约粮食了吗？要节约粮食就不能大量养猪了吗？这个问题的确值得辩论一下。如果在这个问题上不争出个谁是谁非，有些对粮食统购统销素怀不满的人，就可能以多留猪饲料为借口，要挟国家对粮食少购多销；也可能以节约粮食为理由，而对发展生猪生产采取消极退缩的态度。这两种情况，无疑地对国家和农民自己都不利。
    既要努力节约粮食，又要大力发展生猪生产，这是国家的要求。这点到底能不能做到呢？怎样才能做到呢？那些吵着“没有饲料喂猪”的人，是否充分利用了以种植饲料为主要的自留地，是否充分利用了当地的饲料资源了呢？这些，都应该弄明白。湖南省宁乡县许多农业社通过辩论，对养猪和节约粮食的问题已经得出了正确的结论。其他地方的农业社也应该对类似的问题展开辩论，根据当时当地的大量事实和经验，作出正确的结论。
