    Encouraging Phenomena and Things to Be Alert To
    By People's Daily Commentator
    The heads of state and government of Syria and King Saud of Saudi Arabia concluded their two-day talks on the 26th. After the talks, King Saud issued a statement saying that he affirmed that Syria does not threaten any of its neighbors. He will condemn any aggression against Syria. He also announced that he would fight alongside Syria or any other Arab brother country to resist aggression from any quarter that might threaten any of these countries or their independence.
    During King Saud's visit to Syria, Iraqi Prime Minister Jawdat al-Ayoubi was also invited to visit Syria. He held talks with King Saud and the President and Prime Minister of Syria. After the talks, Ayoubi said that a complete understanding had been reached between Iraq and Syria.
    At the same time, Egyptian President Nasser reiterated that if any aggression occurred against Syria, Egypt would support Syria by all means.
    This series of events shows that relations between Arab countries have improved at a time when Syria is facing an increasingly serious threat of imperialist aggression. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. The unity of the Arab countries of the Middle East is the primary guarantee for these countries to maintain their independence. Any weakening of this unity will give imperialism an opportunity to take advantage of it. Because the main means by which imperialism invades the Middle East is to create divisions among the Arab people, exploit contradictions, defeat them one by one, and divide and rule. The schemes of U.S. imperialism in this regard are even more cunning and vicious. The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" of the United States is actually an attempt to instigate and use some Arab countries to oppose other Arab countries, in order to profit from it and eliminate Arab nationalism. Now, the blatant aggression of the United States against Syria has made many Arab countries recognize the insidious face of the United States, and therefore expressed their desire to strengthen their unity. All those who support the just cause of the Arab people against colonialism are pleased by this and hope that this unity can be further consolidated, thereby dealing a fatal blow to the imperialist conspiracy of aggression.
    Faced with this situation, U.S. imperialism cannot but continue to put on some "moderate" appearances on the surface. The U.S. State Department hypocritically stated that if Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, who is attending the UN General Assembly, makes a request, Dulles is willing to meet with Bitar, but Dulles is not willing to take the initiative to request a meeting with Bitar. This shows that the United States has not changed its hostility towards Syria. The statement of the U.S. State Department is just another trick to deceive and numb world public opinion.
    In order to deny the Soviet Union's condemnation of U.S. aggression in the Middle East, Dulles delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly, in which he tried his best to slander the Soviet Union and Syria, and demanded that the UN General Assembly discuss the Middle East situation, appearing to be quite confident. However, Dulles was outwardly strong but inwardly weak. He knew very well that a public debate on the Middle East issue at the UN General Assembly would completely expose the U.S. conspiracy. In order to avoid discussion and deceive and numb public opinion, Dulles released air through Italian Foreign Minister Giuseppe Pella, hoping to "postpone" the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Middle East issue.
    However, the more the United States pretends, the more people need to be vigilant. Because from the actual activities behind this "moderate" posture of the United States, it can be seen that the United States has not abandoned its intention to invade Syria at all. The United States is talking a lot about the so-called "small-scale war" with atomic weapons for surprise attacks. U.S. military weapons are still being rushed to countries around Syria. Turkey, Israel, and Jordan are still issuing calls hostile to Syria. It can be predicted that faced with the situation of Arab countries strengthening their unity, the United States will, on the one hand, continue to exacerbate the tense situation and prepare for open aggression, and on the other hand, strengthen subversive sabotage activities within Syria. The decision of the Baghdad Pact's "Anti-Subversion Committee," in which the United States participates, to expand subversive activities in the Arab world is a very noteworthy sign.
    Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali is absolutely right. He said: "We should not be complacent, but should continue to be vigilant and be prepared to deal with any emergencies, because we have learned a lot of lessons from the conspiracies and tricks of imperialist countries. We understand that calm seas come before every great storm." Indeed, now is the time when the Syrian people need to be most vigilant. U.S. imperialism has not retreated. As long as we continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance and unity, the Syrian people will be able to smash any conspiracy of sudden attack by U.S. imperialism.

    可喜的现象和应该警惕的事情
    本报评论员
    叙利亚国家和政府首脑同沙特阿拉伯国王沙特之间经过两天的会谈，已在26日结束。沙特国王在会谈以后发表声明说，他肯定叙利亚不威胁它的任何邻国。他将谴责对叙利亚的任何侵略。他并宣布他将同叙利亚或其他任何阿拉伯兄弟国家一起战斗，抵抗来自任何方面的可能威胁这些国家中的任何一个或他们的独立的侵略。
    在沙特国王访问叙利亚期间，伊拉克首相乔达特·阿尤比也应邀访问了叙利亚。他同沙特国王和叙利亚的总统、总理都举行了会谈。阿尤比在会谈以后表示，伊拉克和叙利亚之间已经完全获得谅解。
    同时，埃及纳赛尔总统再一次表示，如果发生对叙利亚的任何侵略，埃及将以一切办法支持叙利亚。
    这一系列的事件说明，在叙利亚面临着日益严重的帝国主义的侵略威胁的时候，阿拉伯国家之间的关系有了改善。这是一个十分可喜的现象。中东阿拉伯国家的团结，是这些国家维护他们独立的首要保证。对这一团结的任何削弱，都会给帝国主义以可乘之机。因为帝国主义侵略中东的主要手段，就是在阿拉伯人民中间制造分裂，利用矛盾，各个击破，分而治之。美帝国主义在这方面所施的阴谋，更加狡猾而且恶毒。美国的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，实际上就是企图挑拨和利用一部分阿拉伯国家来反对另一部分阿拉伯国家，以便从中取利，消灭阿拉伯民族主义。现在，美国对叙利亚的露骨的侵略，使得许多阿拉伯国家认识了美国的阴险面目，因而表示要加强它们之间的团结。一切支持阿拉伯人民反对殖民主义的正义事业的人们，都因此而感到高兴，并且希望这种团结能够进一步巩固，从而给予帝国主义的侵略阴谋以致命的打击。
    面对着这种情况，美帝国主义在表面上不能不继续摆出些“温和”的姿态。美国国务院假惺惺地表示，如果出席联合国大会的叙利亚外交部长比塔尔提出要求的话，杜勒斯愿意和比塔尔会见，但是杜勒斯并不愿意主动要求同比塔尔会见。这就说明美国仍然没有改变对叙利亚的敌视。美国国务院的声明，不过是欺骗和麻痹世界舆论的又一种花招。
    杜勒斯为了抵赖苏联对于美国侵略中东的谴责，在联合国大会上曾经发表了一篇竭力诬蔑苏联和叙利亚的演说，并且要求联合国大会讨论中东局势，显得似乎颇为理直气壮的样子。但是，杜勒斯色厉内荏，他完全知道在联合国大会上公开辩论中东问题将使美国阴谋彻底败露。为了避免讨论并且欺骗和麻痹舆论，杜勒斯通过意大利外交部长朱塞佩·贝拉放出空气，希望“推迟”联合国大会对中东问题的讨论。
    但是，美国越是这样装模作样，人们就需要更加保持警惕。因为从美国这种“温和”姿态背后的实际活动，可以看出美国根本没有放弃侵略叙利亚的打算。美国正在大谈用原子武器进行突然袭击的所谓“小规模战争”。美国的军火武器仍然在加紧向叙利亚周围的国家运送。土耳其、以色列和约旦仍然在发出敌视叙利亚的叫嚣。可以预料，面对着阿拉伯国家加强团结的情况，美国将一方面继续加剧紧张局势，准备公开侵略，另一方面加强对叙利亚内部的颠覆破坏活动。美国参加的巴格达集团的“反颠覆委员会”决定扩大在阿拉伯世界的颠覆活动，就是一个很值得注意的迹象。
    叙利亚阿萨利总理说得完全对。他说：“我们不应该高枕无忧，而应该继续警惕，并且准备好对付任何紧急事变，因为我们从帝国主义国家的阴谋诡计中得到了很多经验教训。我们懂得了，在每个大风暴之前会出现风平浪静。”的确，现在是叙利亚人民最需要保持警惕的时候。美帝国主义并没有退却。只要继续保持高度的警惕和团结，叙利亚人民就能粉碎美帝国主义的任何突然袭击的阴谋。
