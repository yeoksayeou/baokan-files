Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 12th (TASS): The Press Office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic announced that the Presidium of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic adopted a statement on September 12th regarding the Soviet government's note to the West German government on September 7th.

The statement said that the government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly and proactively expressed its willingness to reach an agreement with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the extremely important German question. However, the Bonn government has rejected all proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

The statement continued that the Bonn ruling clique's negative attitude toward the Soviet note is a manifestation of their continued pursuit of the old policy that opposes the vital interests of our German people.

The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that protecting the German people from new disasters remains its most important duty in the future. Therefore, it will continue to implement its policy to ensure peace, ease the German situation, bring the two Germanys closer together, reach an agreement, and establish a confederation, thereby gradually uniting the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany into a peaceful, democratic, and anti-imperialist Germany, and signing a peace treaty with Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic solemnly declares that, as in the past, it is ready to achieve these goals through negotiations at any time.

    民主德国政府再次主张
　　两个德国协商统一
    据新华社13日讯  据塔斯社柏林12日讯：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处宣布，德意志民主共和国部长会议主席团9月12日通过了德意志民主共和国政府就苏联政府9月7日给西德政府的照会发表的声明。
    声明说，德意志民主共和国政府屡次主动地表示愿意就极重要的德国问题同德意志联邦共和国政府达成协议。可是，波恩政府拒绝了德意志民主共和国提出的通过和平途径统一德国的一切建议。
    声明接着说，波恩统治集团对苏联照会抱否定态度，这是他们继续实行反对我们德国人民切身利益的旧方针的表现。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为，保卫德国人民免受新的灾难，今后仍是它的最主要的义务，因此它将继续贯彻自己的政策，以求保障和平、缓和德国局势、使两个德国接近和取得协议、建立邦联，从而逐步地把德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国统一为和平的、民主的和反帝国主义的德国、签订对德和约。德意志民主共和国政府郑重声明，它同过去一样准备随时通过谈判来达到这些目的。
