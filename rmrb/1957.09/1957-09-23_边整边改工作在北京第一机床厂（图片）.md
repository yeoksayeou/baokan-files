Rectification and Improvement Work at Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant

The state-owned Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has recently been actively improving its work and leadership style. Leading personnel are personally involved, separately studying and resolving urgent problems that can be solved at present.

In order to improve the leadership style, the factory has established a system stipulating that Party committee members should be assigned to connect with a workshop or a section. This is Party Committee Deputy Secretary Tian Yaochuan (first on the right) going deep into the No. 2 Machining Workshop to study and revise work quotas with workshop cadres.

The paint mist emitted during the painting process in the paint spraying section has an impact on human health. According to the workers' opinions, the factory leaders have decided to install equipment in this workshop to remove the paint mist and improve the workers' working environment. This is the dust collector being made. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu HuiRu photographed

    边整边改工作在北京第一机床厂
    国营北京第一机床厂最近积极改进工作，改进领导作风。领导人员亲自动手，分头研究和解决目前急需解决而又可能解决的问题。
    为了改进领导作风，这个厂制定了一项制度，规定党委委员都要分工联系一个车间或一个科室。这是党委副书记田耀川（右第一人）深入加工第二车间和车间干部一起研究修改工时定额。
