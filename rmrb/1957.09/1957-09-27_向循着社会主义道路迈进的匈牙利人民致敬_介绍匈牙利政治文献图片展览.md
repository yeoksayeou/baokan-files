Saluting the Hungarian People Marching on the Socialist Road
—Introducing the Hungarian Political Literature and Picture Exhibition

The "Hungary Marching on the Socialist Road—Hungarian Political Literature and Picture Exhibition (1919-1957)" opened yesterday at Zhongshan Park in the capital. This exhibition comprehensively reveals the truth about the U.S. imperialism's consistent efforts, especially the counter-revolutionary riot it created in Hungary last year, and it powerfully refutes the shameless slander of the so-called "Hungarian question" adopted by the special session of the United Nations manipulated by the United States.

As we walk through the gate of the exhibition, the large and small pictures and explanations around us strongly create a profound impression: that the brave Hungarian people, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have waged an indomitable struggle against counter-revolutionary forces at home and abroad from the first day of establishing a workers' regime in 1919 until now.

When the first picture introducing "Hungary and the Hungarian People" is before us, it makes us express our respect for this heroic country.

The striking large photographs of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin and Sámuel Tibor, one of the leaders of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, illustrate the upsurge of the Hungarian workers' revolutionary movement and national liberation movement under the influence of the Soviet Union's great October Socialist Revolution. In 1919, the Hungarian Soviet Republic was born, and the Hungarian regime was for the first time in the hands of the working class and the peasants. Due to the collusion between the U.S. and British imperialist intervention troops and domestic counter-revolutionaries, the young Soviet regime was overthrown on August 1, 1919. Subsequently, the era of Horthy's fascist terror began.

The exciting giant picture of the "Liberation Monument" illustrates that the Hungarian people have been liberated from the long-term painful oppression of reactionary rule. Under the blows of the Soviet Red Army, the despicable and shameful fascist terror rule and the anti-people semi-feudal system collapsed and disintegrated. The Communist Party, which had moved from underground to open activity, led the country's democratic improvement work under the slogan of "Land, Bread, and Freedom."

The title and pictures of "The Hungarian Miracle," which are very interesting, illustrate the Hungarian people's heroic struggle to quickly restore the national economy with the assistance of the Soviet Union. The nationalization of mines, banks, factories, and enterprises consolidated the regime of the working class, and the planning of the national economy and the conduct of socialist construction were reliably guaranteed. Factories and bridges were successively repaired. Rural areas began to be electrified, and rural health, housing, and health care institutions were under construction...

The large horizontal pictures marking the achievements of socialist construction in the Hungarian People's Republic illustrate the beautiful picture created by the glorious labor of the Hungarian people in the first five-year plan.

The title and pictures of "This is how it happened," which are particularly attractive and concerned, tell us that the United States committed heinous crimes in the counter-revolutionary rebellion it created in Hungary last year. In the afternoon of October 23, 1956, under the advocacy of anti-democratic forces, many deceived young university students organized a parade and demonstration. That night, according to a unified strategic plan, the counter-revolutionaries first attacked strongholds such as radio stations and central telephone bureaus, and at the same time used organized commando teams to attack military targets such as barracks, armories, and motor vehicle camps in various districts of Budapest. The national emblem of the People's Republic was torn from the national flag by the counter-revolutionaries, and the red flag and red star, symbols of working-class and international workers' solidarity, were burned. At the same time as the armed rebellion broke out, weapons began to be secretly transported into Hungary from the western border of Hungary. A large number of trained armed spies began to operate throughout the country. The "Free Europe" radio station became the headquarters of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Horthy, the butcher who slaughtered the Hungarian people, asked Western countries to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. The "prince" of the Habsburg dynasty expressed his desire to inherit the Hungarian throne. In order to facilitate the command of counter-revolutionary activities, Ferenc Nagy, the traitor who sold out his country and former Prime Minister of Hungary, flew from the United States to Vienna, the capital of Austria. The counter-revolutionaries opened the doors of prisons and released criminals, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. Those fascist parties that were banned after World War II were also revived. Organized mobs attacked the Budapest Party Committee and massacred many arrested Communist Party members, security personnel, people's military officers, etc., cruel atrocities, and exterminated humanity. This is the whole truth about the United States' attempt to drown the Hungarian people in a sea of blood, and it is undeniable.

The large-character headlines and pictures of "The Statue of Liberty" and "Who Leads the Country" once again turn people from painful memories to excitement. On November 3, 1956, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government headed by Kádár was established. At the request of the Hungarian government, the Soviet army quickly assisted the Hungarian people, and they completely defeated the armed counter-revolutionary bandits in extremely difficult street fighting. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, quickly restored social order and healed their wounds. On May 1, 1957, the people of Budapest held a parade and demonstration, unanimously expressing their support for the workers' and peasants' regime—the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the Socialist Workers' Party. This symbolizes that the Hungarian people are victoriously marching on the road of socialism.

    向循着社会主义道路迈进的匈牙利人民致敬
    ——介绍匈牙利政治文献图片展览
    “循着社会主义道路迈进的匈牙利——匈牙利政治文献图片展览（1919—1957）”昨天在首都中山公园开幕了。这个展览全面地揭露了美帝国主义一贯地、特别是去年在匈牙利制造反革命暴乱事件的真相，它有力地驳斥了美国操纵联合国特别会议所通过的所谓关于“匈牙利问题”的无耻诽谤。
    当我们走进展览会的大门，周围的大小图片和说明，使我们强烈的构成一种深刻的印象；这就是：勇敢的有着光荣革命传统的匈牙利人民从1919年建立工人政权的第一天起直到现在为止，同国内外反革命力量进行了不屈不挠的斗争。
    当第一幅介绍“匈牙利和匈牙利人民”的图片在我们面前的时候，它使我们对这个英雄国家表示尊敬。
    引人注目的伟大革命导师列宁和匈牙利苏维埃共和国领导人之一的萨姆叶尔·迪波尔的高大照片，说明了在苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命影响下，匈牙利工人革命运动和民族解放运动的高涨。1919年，匈牙利苏维埃共和国诞生了，匈牙利政权第一次掌握在工人阶级和农民的手里。由于以美英帝国主义干涉军和国内的反革命分子里应外合，年青的苏维埃政权于1919年8月1日被颠覆了。随后，霍尔蒂的法西斯恐怖统治时代开始了。
    令人兴奋的“解放纪念像”巨幅图片，说明了匈牙利人民从长期的反动统治的痛苦压迫下解放出来了。在苏联红军的打击下，卑鄙可耻的法西斯恐怖统治和反人民的半封建的制度崩溃解体了。从地下转到公开活动的共产党，在争取“土地、面包和自由”的口号下，领导了国家的民主改进工作。
    “匈牙利的奇迹”这个很能使人感到兴趣的标题和图片，说明了匈牙利人民在苏联的援助下，很快地展开恢复国民经济的英勇斗争。矿山、银行、工厂、企业的国有化巩固了工人阶级的政权，国民经济的计划化和社会主义建设的进行获得了可靠的保证。工厂、桥梁都相继修复。农村开始电气化，农村的卫生、住宅和保健的机构都在建筑中……。
    标志着匈牙利人民共和国社会主义建设成就的横幅大图片，说明匈牙利人民在第一个五年计划中的光荣的劳动所创造的美好图景。
    “事情是这样发生的”这个特别吸引人注意和关心的标题和图片告诉了我们，美国在去年制造的匈牙利反革命叛乱事件中，犯了滔天的罪行。在1956年10月23日午饭后，在反民主势力的倡导下，许多受骗的青年大学生组织了一次游行示威。当夜，反革命分子根据统一的战略计划，首先攻击了广播电台、中央电话局等据点，同时用有组织的突击队攻击了布达佩斯各区兵营、军械库、汽车营等军事目标。人民共和国的国徽被反革命分子从国旗上扯下来了，工人阶级和国际工人团结的标志——红旗和红星都被烧掉了。在武装叛乱爆发的同时，武器开始从匈牙利的西部边界秘密地运进匈牙利国内。大批受过训练的武装间谍开始在全国活动。“自由欧州”广播电台成为了反革命叛乱的指挥部。屠杀匈牙利人民的刽子手霍尔蒂，请求西方各国干涉匈牙利内政。哈布斯堡王朝的“皇子”，表示自己要继承匈牙利王位。为了便于指挥反革命活动，出卖祖国的叛徒——匈牙利前任总理费伦茨·纳吉从美国坐飞机赶到奥地利首都维也纳。反革命分子打开监狱的大门，释放了刑事犯、间谍、反革命分子。那些在第二次世界战争以后被禁止的法西斯政党也复活了。有组织的暴徒袭击了布达佩斯党委会，大肆屠杀了许多被捕的共产党员、保安人员、人民军官等等，残酷的暴行，绝灭人寰。这就是美国企图把匈牙利人民淹没在血海里的全部真相，它是无法抵赖的。
    “自由的雕像”和“谁领导全国”的大字标题和图片，又把人们从痛苦的记忆里转回到欣奋。1956年11月3日，以卡达尔为首的匈牙利工农革命政府成立了。应匈牙利政府请求的苏联军队迅速援助匈牙利人民，他们在极其艰苦的巷战中彻底击溃了武装的反革命匪帮。在苏联、中国及各人民民主国家的援助下，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党的领导下，迅速的恢复了社会秩序，医治了创伤。1957年5月1日，布达佩斯市人民举行游行示威，一致表示拥护工农政权——工农革命政府和社会主义工人党。这象征了匈牙利人民正在社会主义的大道上胜利迈进。
