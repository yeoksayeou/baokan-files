　　Rightist elements all speak with one voice; their common conspiracy is to attempt to abolish the leadership of the Party and stand on the heads of the working people once again. They disguise themselves as various kinds of experts, propagating that the Party cannot lead specialized work, saying that laymen cannot lead experts. They lie with their eyes open, denying all achievements since liberation, thereby opposing the socialist system. Rightist elements in the music world, such as Liu Xue'an and Zhang Quan, are no exception. Like all comrades who love New China and love the socialist cause, I feel boundless anger towards the words and deeds of these mad rightist elements. I am a music worker and recently participated in the selection work for the vocal music competition of the Sixth World Youth Festival. I want to use the facts of the great achievements made by New China in various competitions this time to shatter the fallacies of the rightist elements who say that our cultural and artistic undertakings after liberation are not as good as in the past.

　　This festival was the largest in history, with participants from more than 120 countries. A total of 3,109 young artists from various countries participated in the art competition, with 21 competition items. The Chinese delegation participated in 14 items, with a total of 88 programs, winning 27 gold awards and 23 silver awards and 16 bronze awards for collective and individual programs. Since several people won medals for some programs, a total of 34 gold medals, 31 silver medals, and 18 bronze medals were won, totaling 83 medals. It is worth pointing out that the number of our gold medals exceeded silver and bronze medals, and accounted for more than 12.1% of all 280 gold medals in the Sixth World Youth Festival art competition.

　　Among the 14 competitions we participated in, 36 music programs won awards, including 18 gold awards, 9 silver awards, and 9 bronze awards. Here, the gold awards again took the lead.

　　Professor Dimitrov, a Bulgarian judge, told me that he had participated in the judging of the previous art competitions of the festival, and he believed that our level was different each time, and the competition results of this session were significantly improved compared with the fifth festival. He praised us, saying: "Your progress is really rapid!"

　　Through the art competition of this festival, and the cultural performances during the festival, the young artists of New China shone brilliantly on the international stage. The scope of music programs that won awards was very wide. Whether it was folk music, classical music, Eastern or Western traditional music, they all showed outstanding achievements and won the highest medals. Our folk singing (four gold awards), national musical instruments (eight gold awards), and Eastern classical singing (two gold awards) have all developed greatly, and the quality is higher than before. In terms of Western classical music, gold awards were also won in the piano and vocal music competitions, achieving results we have never achieved in the festival before. These achievements powerfully illustrate the unprecedented development of our cultural and artistic undertakings after liberation, illustrate the correctness of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy on literature and art, and more importantly, illustrate the Party's strong leadership in the field of culture and art.

　　Now let's talk about the development situation at home. I am a music worker, and I will still use music as an example:

　　From the time the Kuomintang started running music academies in 1927 until its collapse in 1949, in more than 20 years, there were only two isolated music academies with very few departments, incomplete facilities, simple equipment, and low quality, serving the bourgeoisie. Students not only had to pay tuition fees, but also had to rent pianos for practice themselves. For choir performances in school concerts, students had to pay for their own costumes. Poor students, even talented ones, were discriminated against by the school. For example, Comrade Xian Xinghai and others were persecuted by the school. But what about today? Our music schools belong to all the people. As long as you have talent and the conditions to study, anyone has the opportunity to study. In the short eight years since liberation, we have already had two music academies, four music colleges, six music secondary schools, and several amateur and professional music primary schools that have been opened in the past year. I remember that the former Shanghai Conservatory of Music was as small as a medium-sized capitalist's residence, with about twenty pianos inside, and the auditorium could only accommodate thirty or forty people. Today, just taking our Central Conservatory of Music as an example, the school buildings are constantly expanding, being built, and adding equipment. Now we have seven departments and better teaching equipment, a large number of books and records, many record appreciation rooms, more than two hundred pianos, and one hundred and several dozen practice rooms (with many pianos placed in the classrooms). This is a brief picture of music education. Before liberation, there were almost no performing groups. Today, we already have the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra, the Broadcasting Philharmonic Orchestra, the Military Band, Western symphony orchestras, and Chinese national orchestras. In addition, there are two experimental opera houses in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as many cultural troupes and theaters. Through the continuous training and hard practice of these educational institutions and performing groups, a large number of excellent and outstanding musical talents have emerged in recent years. Many people have surpassed the achievements of the previous generation. This is the pride of our era! We cheer for the progress of New China. These achievements have all been achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the past, our music garden had never bloomed with such lush flowers, so we understand that only under the leadership of the Party can our art develop rapidly! The vast majority of our literary and art workers resolutely support the policies of the Communist Party and faithfully implement the policies of the Party. The conspiracies of the rightist elements have long been seen through by everyone. We have all sharpened our weapons and will definitely completely defeat the rampant attacks of the rightist elements.

    从音乐事业的发展回击右派
    中央音乐学院声乐系主任　喻宜萱
    右派分子都是一个鼻孔出气的，他们的共同阴谋是企图取消党的领导，重新站在劳动人民的头上。他们伪装为各色各样的专家，宣传党不能领导专门业务，说什么外行不能领导内行；他们睁着眼睛撒谎，否定解放后一切成就，从而来反对社会主义制度。音乐界的右派分子刘雪庵、张权等之流也不例外。我和所有热爱新中国、热爱社会主义事业的同志们一样，对这些丧心病狂的右派分子的言行，感到无比的愤怒。我是一个音乐工作者，最近参加了第六届世界青年联欢节声乐比赛的评选工作，我要以新中国在这次的各项比赛中所取得的巨大成就的事实，来击破右派分子说我们解放后的文化艺术事业不如过去的谰言。
    这次联欢节是有史以来规模最大的一次，参加的国家有一百二十余个，参加艺术竞赛的各国青年艺术家共三千一百零九人，比赛的项目二十一项，中国代表团参加了十四项，共八十八个节目，获得了集体节目和个人节目金奖二十七个，银奖二十三个，铜奖十六个。由于有些节目几个人获得奖章，因此共获得金质奖章三十四枚，银质奖章三十一枚，铜质奖章十八枚，共八十三枚。值得指出的是我们的金质奖章的数字超过银章和铜章，而且占了第六届联欢节全部艺术竞赛二百八十枚金质奖章的十分之一点二强。
    在我们参加的十四项比赛中，获奖的音乐节目共三十六个，其中金奖十八个，银奖九个，铜奖九个，在这里金奖又是领先的。
    一位保加利亚评委狄米特洛夫教授对我说，他曾经参加过上几次联欢节文艺竞赛的评选工作，他认为我们的水平一次比一次不同，这一届比第五届联欢节的比赛成绩有很显著的提高。他并以赞扬的口吻说：“你们的进步，真是突飞猛进！”
    通过这次联欢节的艺术竞赛，以及在联欢节期中的文艺表演，新中国青年艺术家在国际舞台上放出了灿烂的光芒。音乐节目获奖的范围很广泛，无论是民间音乐，古典音乐，东方的或西方的传统音乐，都表现了突出的成绩，获得了最高的奖章。我们的民间歌唱（四个金奖），民族乐器（八个金奖），东方古典唱法（两个金奖）都有了很大的发展，质量都比以前高。在西洋古典音乐方面，钢琴和声乐两项竞赛中也获得了金奖，取得了我们在联欢节中从来没有取得的成绩。这些成绩，有力地说明了解放后我们在文化艺术事业上的空前发展，说明了党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”文艺方针的正确性，更说明了党在文化艺术领域中的强有力的领导力量。
    现在让我们再来谈谈国内的发展情况，我是一个音乐工作者，仍引音乐为例：
    国民党从1927年开始办音乐院到1949年垮台时为止，二十多年中还只有两所孤零零的、科系很少的、不完整的、设备简陋的、质量不高的为资产阶级服务的音乐院。学生不但要付学费，还要自己租钢琴练习，学校开音乐会的合唱表演，还要学生自己出钱做演出服。穷学生，哪怕是有才能的，也得受学校的歧视，例如冼星海同志等就遭到过学校的迫害。但是，今天怎么样？我们的音乐学校是属于全民的，只要你有才能，具有学习条件，不管谁都有学习机会。解放后短短的八年中，我们已经有了两所音乐院，四所音乐专科学校，六所音乐中学，以及最近一年来开办的好几所业余和专业音乐小学。我记得过去的上海音乐院，院址小得像一座中号资本家的住宅，里面约有二十来架钢琴，礼堂只能容纳三四十人；今天单就我们中央音乐学院来说，校舍在不断地扩充，修建，增添设备。现在我们已经有七个系，并有较好的教学设备，大量的图书唱片，许多唱片欣赏室，两百多架钢琴，一百几十间练琴室（有许多琴摆在教室内），这就是音乐教育方面的简略的面貌。演出团体，解放前几乎是没有的，今天我们已经有了中央乐团，上海乐团，广播乐团，军乐团，有西洋管弦乐队，也有国乐管弦乐队，此外还有北京和上海的两个实验歌剧院，以及许许多多的文工团和剧院。从这些教育机构和演出团体的不断培养和努力实践中，近几年来涌现了大批优秀的杰出的音乐人才，不少人超过了前一辈的成就，这是我们这时代的骄傲！我们为新中国的进步而欢呼。这些成绩都是在共产党的领导下取得的。过去，我们的音乐园地从来不曾开出过这样茂盛的花朵，因此我们懂得只有在党的领导下，我们的艺术才能很快的发展！我们绝大多数的文艺工作者都坚决地拥护共产党的政策，忠实地去执行党的政策。右派分子的阴谋早已被大家识破，我们都已磨好武器，一定彻底打垮右派分子的猖狂进攻。
