Xinhua News Agency, 13th: China's fire prevention work has developed significantly in recent years. The number of fires and losses due to fire have been significantly reduced in many areas compared to the past. In 1956, fire losses in fourteen major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Shenyang decreased by 31.8% compared to 1952.

All parts of the country have universally used newspapers, broadcasts, movies, slides, propaganda posters, popular fire prevention knowledge materials, and exhibitions to conduct fire prevention publicity and education for the masses. Many regions and enterprises have established mass voluntary fire brigades in conjunction with fire prevention publicity and education. In Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan, Shenyang, Xi'an, and Zhejiang and Anhui provinces alone, there are more than 300,000 voluntary firefighters.

Fire prevention inspections and the improvement of fire sources have also been widely carried out in urban and some rural areas. In 1956, in nine cities including Shenyang, Dalian, and Guangzhou alone, more than 70% of the fire hazards discovered in enterprises and basic construction sites were dealt with in a timely manner. Chongqing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wenzhou and other cities have also improved more than 360,000 dangerous stoves, chimneys, wires and lights in residential houses.

At present, fire agencies at all levels have been established, all cities have established fire brigades to directly fight fires, and equipment has also been improved. Through diligent study, hard training, and practical work, the professional and technical levels of all fire cadres and police have been significantly improved, and many model figures have emerged. Now, the time it takes for fire brigades in general cities to dispatch vehicles after receiving a fire alarm is more than twice as fast as in the early days of liberation.

　　加强消防工作领导  广泛组织群众防火
    许多地区火灾事故显著减少
    据新华社13日讯  我国的消防事业几年来已有显著发展，许多地区发生火灾的次数和由于火灾而受到的损失已较过去显著减少。1956年，北京、上海、天津、重庆、广州、西安、沈阳等十四个大城市的火灾损失较1952年减少了31.8％。
    全国各地都普遍利用报刊、广播、电影、幻灯、宣传画、通俗消防知识资料和举办展览等形式，对广大群众进行防火宣传教育。很多地区和企业单位结合防火宣传教育，建立了群众性的义务消防组织。仅北京、上海、重庆、武汉、沈阳、西安等市和浙江、安徽两省就有义务消防人员三十多万人。
    在城市和部分农村地区还普遍开展了防火检查和改善火源的工作。1956年仅沈阳、旅大、广州等九个城市，在企业单位和基本建设工地发现的火险，有70％以上都及时采取措施进行了处理。重庆、上海、杭州、温州等市，还改善了居民住宅中的危险炉灶、烟囱、电线和灯火等三十六万多件。
    目前，各级消防机构已经建立，所有城市都建立了直接同火灾作斗争的消防队伍，器材装备也有了改善。全体消防干部和民警经过勤学苦练和实际工作的锻炼，业务技术水平有了显著提高，并涌现出不少模范人物。现在一般城市的消防队接到火灾警报后的出车时间，比解放初期的速度提前了一倍以上。
