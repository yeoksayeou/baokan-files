"Monk's head on the mountain, no water flows in the gully, hoping for next year this year, but no harvest every year."

    Before liberation, the farmers in the Huling area of Jiyuan County, Henan Province, often used this folk song to express the sorrow in their hearts. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the masses organized to close the mountains for afforestation, conserve water and soil, and develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry production. The "monk's head" has grown lush forests again. The poor mountains have become prosperous mountainous areas with "green mountains, sheep in pens, and endless grain." The picture shows a corner of Huling Mountain Village. (Photo by Li Dewu)

    “山上和尚头，沟里没水流，今年盼明年，年年都不收。”
    解放前，河南省济源县虎岭一带的农民，经常用这首民歌来倾诉自己内心的悲痛。解放后，群众在党和政府的领导下，组织起来进行了封山育林，保持水土，发展农、林、牧生产。“和尚头”又长满了茂密的树林。穷山变成了“绿满山，羊满圈，粮食打的吃不完”的富裕山区。　图为虎岭山村的一角。　李德武　摄
