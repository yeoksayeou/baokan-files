　　Sell More Cotton to the State
　　Cotton Purchasing Efforts Strengthened in Most Parts of Hebei, Henan, and Jiangsu

    This newspaper reports that cotton picking has begun in the southern regions of Hebei Province, and many agricultural cooperatives are starting to sell cotton to the state in accordance with pre-sale contracts.

    As of September 4th, according to incomplete statistics from the four special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding, the state had already purchased more than 1,790,000 jin of unginned cotton. The Handan Special District has recently been receiving about 400,000 jin of unginned cotton per day. In the key cotton-producing counties of Nangong and Wei in Xingtai Special District, over 20,000 jin of unginned cotton are being collected daily.

    According to the results of trial ginning by local processing plants, the quality of this year's new cotton is very high. In Guangping and Cheng'an counties of Handan Special District, trial ginning shows that every 100 jin of unginned cotton can produce 38 jin of ginned cotton, generally grade four cotton, with a small amount being grade three, which is one grade higher than the quality at the same time last year.

    Under the requirement of the principle of "collecting quickly and collecting more," supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have made full preparations for purchasing, processing, storage, and transportation. To facilitate the delivery of cotton by the masses, the number of cotton purchasing stations has been increased in various regions.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 12th: The Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system is actively strengthening cotton purchasing work.

    More than 13 million mu of cotton in Henan Province is being harvested in large quantities. In the past period, many supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions actively purchased cotton. For example, the cotton purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives in Nanyang Special District from September 1st to 5th increased by sixty-four times compared to the same period last year. The Xiaoji purchasing station in Xinxiang County purchased 200,000 jin of cotton on September 3rd. However, in some other regions, due to the passive emotions of supply and marketing cooperative cadres who were waiting for purchases, cotton purchasing work has not yet been carried out. This unbalanced situation in cotton purchasing work has attracted the attention of party and government leading organs and business departments at all levels in the province. In early September, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative specifically convened an emergency meeting of the directors of the cooperative offices in each special district to implement the directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on cotton unified purchase work, and mobilized the employees of the supply and marketing cooperative system throughout the province to examine and criticize the passive waiting mood in their work from top to bottom. Local party and government leaders are combining this with the rural socialist debate to educate farmers to carry out patriotic cotton sales movements. At present, 1,130 cotton purchasing stations have been added in the province, and a large number of technicians have been equipped. In the concentrated cotton-producing areas, a network of cotton purchasing stations has been formed.

    This newspaper reports that the number of cotton purchasing points in Jiangsu Province has increased compared to last year, and all are equipped with cadres; all 1,800 cotton inspectors in the province have received technical training; and 15,000 members of agricultural cooperatives have already received or are receiving technical training, learning to "pick separately, dry separately, store separately, and sell separately." To ensure that cotton is collected, ginned, transported, and handed over as it is received, local purchasing points have also prepared sufficient packaging materials.

    Currently, the climate is good, and cotton is maturing rapidly in various regions. It is estimated that cotton will generally be available in large quantities throughout the province in late September. The unified purchase of cotton is about to enter a tense stage.

    Responsible persons from relevant departments in Jiangsu Province pointed out: In order to guarantee the clothing needs of the people of the whole country, all regions are required to strictly control the amount of cotton retained by individual cotton farmers, strictly prohibit the free trade of cotton, mobilize agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers to save cotton, use old cotton, save and use good cotton, dry and clean it, and sell more good cotton to the state; and it is necessary to achieve "pick quickly, sort quickly, dry quickly, sell quickly."

    Jiangpu, Rudong, Fengxian and other counties have started purchasing new cotton, and the quality of the cotton is generally very good.

　　把更多的棉花卖给国家
　　河北河南江苏大部地区购棉工作加强
    本报讯  河北省南部地区已经开始摘花，很多农业社按照预售合同，开始向国家售棉。
    到9月4日，据邯郸、邢台、石家庄、保定四个专区不完全的统计，国家已收购籽棉一百七十九万多斤。邯郸专区近来每天可以收到籽棉四十万斤左右。邢台专区南宫、威县两个重点产棉县，都日收籽棉两万多斤。
    据各地加工厂试轧的结果，今年的新棉质量很高。邯郸专区广平、成安两县试轧，每百斤籽棉能出三十八斤皮棉，一般的是四级棉，有少数是三级的，比去年同期质量高一级。
    各地供销社在“快收多收”的方针要求下，对收购、加工、保管、运输等工作，都进行了充分准备。为便于群众交售，各地都增加了棉花收购站。
    新华社郑州12日电  河南省供销合作社系统正在积极加强棉花收购工作。
    河南省一千三百多万亩棉花已经大量收摘。过去一段时期内，不少地区的供销社积极地收购棉花，如南阳专区各地供销社在9月1日到5日收购的棉花，比去年同期增加六十四倍。新乡县小冀采购站9月3日收购棉花二十万斤。但是在另外的一些地区，因为供销社干部存在着坐等收购的消极情绪，棉花收购工作到现在还没有开展起来。棉花收购工作上这种不平衡的状况，已经引起省内各级党政领导机关和业务部门的注意。省供销合作社在9月上旬专门召开了各专区合作办事处主任紧急会议，贯彻中共中央和国务院关于棉花统购工作的指示，并发动全省供销合作社系统的从业人员，自上而下地检查与批判工作中的消极等待情绪。各地党政领导正在结合农村社会主义大辩论，教育农民开展爱国售棉运动。目前省内已增设一千一百三十个棉花收购站，配备了大批技术人员。在各集中产棉区，一个星罗棋布的棉花收购网已经形成。
    本报讯  江苏省棉花收购点比去年增多，都配齐了干部；全省棉花检验人员一千八百多人都受到技术训练；农业社已有一万五千人已经或正在接受技术训练，学会“分摘、分晒、分藏、分卖”。为做到随收随轧随运随交，各地收购点也准备好了充足的包装器材。
    目前气候良好，各地棉花成熟较快，估计本月下旬全省棉花将普遍大批上市。棉花统购工作即将进入紧张阶段。
    江苏省有关部门负责人指出：为了保证全国人民的衣着需要，要求各地严格控制棉农个人的留用量，严禁棉花自由买卖，动员农业社和单干农民节约用棉，利用旧棉，省用好棉，晒干拣净，多卖好棉给国家；并要做到“快拾、快拣、快晒、快卖”。
    江浦、如东、奉贤等县已开秤收购新棉，棉花质量一般都很好。
