Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Damascus dispatch from Xinhua News Agency on the 19th: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said on the 18th, in reference to the Turkish troops concentrating on the Syrian border, that Syria has taken all necessary measures to deal with any eventuality. He stated: "We must continue to pay close attention to our own security and independence."

On the same day, the Secretary-General of the Syrian Ministry of Interior, Ihsan Kawas, said that Turkish tanks and armored units were carrying out unusual movements in the areas of Kirikhan, Reyhanli and Antakya. Turkish aircraft are also flying near the Syrian border.

Reports indicate that more U.S. military delegations and experts have recently arrived in Beirut and Amman. The main purpose of the delegation to Beirut is to inspect Lebanese military bases and how they are used.

Damascus has strengthened security and preventive measures. Reports indicate that the Damascus garrison has been notified that, starting on the 18th, they are not to leave their barracks and must be ready at any time.

According to a report in the Damascus "Al-Nour" on the 19th, the Latakia trade union in Syria has recently begun to cooperate with the People's Resistance Organization to train workers in the use of weapons in order to prepare for dealing with imperialist conspiracies.

"Al-Nour" and "Al-Ra'i al-Aam" both published editorials on September 18, calling on the people to remain vigilant, not be overly optimistic, and be prepared to deal with any emergency.

These words are considered to be directed at the overly optimistic sentiments that have recently arisen among some Syrian officials, newspapers, and the people. This sentiment has grown particularly after the Soviet Union issued warnings to the United States and Turkey, and other countries expressed their support for Syria. Some people even believe that the United States is now retreating.

　　土耳其军队集结边境蠢蠢欲动
　　叙利亚采取措施预防不测
　　叙报要求人民保持警惕不要过分乐观
    本报综合报道　据新华社19日讯：大马士革消息，叙利亚总理阿萨利18日在谈到土耳其军队集中到叙利亚边境的问题时说，叙利亚已经采取了一切必要措施来对付任何不测事件。他表示：“我们要继续密切注意我们自己的安全和独立。”
    同一天，叙利亚内政部秘书长伊桑·卡瓦斯说，土耳其坦克和装甲部队在基里汉、里霍里耶和安塔布地区进行不平常的调动。土耳其飞机也在叙利亚边境附近飞行。
    有消息说，最近有更多的美国军事代表团和专家到达贝鲁特和安曼，前往贝鲁特的代表团的主要目的是视察黎巴嫩的军事基地以及这些基地的使用情况。
    大马士革已经加强治安预防措施。有消息说，大马士革的卫戍部队已经得到通知，从18日开始不得离开兵营，要随时待命。
    据大马士革“光明报”19日报道，叙利亚拉塔基亚工会最近已经开始同人民抵抗组织合作训练工人使用武器，以作好对付帝国主义阴谋的准备。
    “光明报”和“舆论报”9月18日都发表社论，要求人民保持警惕，不要过分乐观，准备应付任何紧急事变。
    这些话被认为是针对最近一些叙利亚官员、报纸和人民产生了过分乐观的情绪而说的。特别是在苏联对美国和土耳其提出警告以及其他国家表示支持叙利亚以后，这种情绪有所增长。有些人甚至认为，美国现在退却了。
