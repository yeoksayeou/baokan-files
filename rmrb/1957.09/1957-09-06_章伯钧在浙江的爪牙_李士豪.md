    Zhang Bojun's Henchman in Zhejiang – Li Shihao
    Tu Zhengfeng
    Li Shihao, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Forestry Department, and a rightist, has had his anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies thoroughly exposed and discredited by the broad masses in recent days.
    Rightist Li Shihao was Zhang Bojun's henchman in Zhejiang. Zhang Bojun once said: "The CCP can lead the revolution, and our Peasants and Workers can also lead the revolution." Li Shihao also said: "Communists are made of special material, and our democratic parties are also made of special material." During the period of extensive airing of views and debates, Zhang Bojun proposed a "Political Design Institute" in Beijing, and Li Shihao clamored in Hangzhou: "The role, status, and relationship of democratic parties with the Party must be reconsidered." Zhang Bojun said that the documents produced by the State Council were all "finished products," and Li Shihao also said: "The documents produced by the Provincial People's Committee are of very high quality and cannot be discussed." The Zhang-Luo alliance proposed "Rehabilitation Committees" and "abolishing the Party committee system in universities," and Li Shihao immediately called on people to "sue the Communist Party" and "complain about the Communist Party's bitterness." Zhang Bojun "wanted to run three publications" as propaganda tools against the Party and socialism, and Li Shihao immediately responded, saying: "We in Zhejiang must also run a decent publication." Zhang Bojun planned to develop one to two million party members in Beijing, and Li Shihao immediately implemented the policy of "blooming everywhere, spreading across all sectors" in Zhejiang, opening the door to prisoners in labor camps, counter-revolutionaries, and those who betrayed the Communist Party, and using "deceit, invitation, snatching, digging, and pulling" to accelerate the expansion of "troops and horses." Since the end of last year, Li Shihao had been telling everyone he met: "Old Zhang Bojun's mood has changed greatly." Li Shihao himself also felt that "older members no longer have a feeling of twilight," and also said: "With trusted cadres like us, Bojun can do a great job."
    After the Party put forward the policy of rectification, Li Shihao traveled by car between Hangzhou and Jinhua, setting fires everywhere. Li Shihao also mobilized members of the Peasants and Workers Party to go to the grassroots levels of medicine and health, culture and education, and engineering technology to start fires, and repeatedly urged them: "Talk about fundamental issues," talk about "Party-mass relations," and talk about problems in the "Three-Anti" and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movements. Li Shihao personally invited targets of the "Three-Anti" and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" campaigns and those dissatisfied with the Party to a forum in the Forestry Department. In just twenty-five days, from May 20th to June 13th, Li Shihao held nearly thirty such forums, mobilizing his so-called "masses" from all sides to attack the Party.
    In his daily work, Li Shihao used every opportunity to carry out anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. Li Shihao often told people: "Party members cannot lead professional work," and "The Party group's opinions can be listened to or not." Li Shihao even used his authority to tamper with the Party's policies. Last spring, while several other deputy directors went to the countryside to promote afforestation, Li Shihao independently convened a provincial conference on state-owned forest farms, disregarding the opposition of forestry engineering and technical personnel, and arbitrarily changed Zhejiang's production policy for forest farms, which had been based on the central government's emphasis on vigorously creating timber forests for several years, to developing diversified operations and achieving self-sufficiency within three to five years, and forced the conference to implement it. Over the past year, this erroneous policy has disrupted the state's timber production plan, causing Zhejiang's state-owned forest farms to neglect their proper duties, and nurseries have been unable to serve afforestation, causing great losses. In twelve state-owned forest farms across the province, workers in eight forest farms were unwilling to cultivate seedlings but instead went up the mountains to dig bamboo shoots and burn charcoal, and if the seedlings in the nurseries died, they would replant them with watermelons and peanuts. Some forest farms felt that their production policies were the same as those of agricultural farms, and therefore actively requested to merge with nearby agricultural farms.
    Li Shihao often boasted: "Everything I, Li Shihao, have done in my life is open and aboveboard." But what things can he tell people about? This Li Shihao, who came from a landlord class background, joined the Kuomintang's First National Congress in 1926, and soon after defected to Wang Jingwei. In 1931, he joined the Third Party and engaged in political speculation. When the War of Resistance Against Japan began, he defected to Xuan Tiewu, the head of the military intelligence service. When Xuan Tiewu went to Shanghai to become the Shanghai Garrison Commander after the victory of the War of Resistance, Li Shihao moved into Xuan Tiewu's police apartment under the pretext of seeking medical treatment, with all expenses paid by Xuan. In 1948, the organization of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party was destroyed, and some party members were arrested, but Li Shihao was the only one who was protected by Xuan Tiewu and even received a huge sum of 200 million yuan from the CC system's Farmers Bank to do business. Since liberation and up to now, he has not forgotten Xuan Tiewu and still receives money and clothing from Xuan Tiewu from Hong Kong from time to time.
    Li Shihao's reactionary crimes are "as solid as a mountain of iron," and he cannot get away with trying to muddle through.

    章伯钧在浙江的爪牙——李士豪
    屠正峰
    农工民主党中央执行局委员、浙江省主委、浙江省林业厅长、右派分子李士豪，近日来，经过广大群众的揭发批判，他的反党、反社会主义的阴谋诡计已经彻底破产了。
    右派分子李士豪，是章伯钧在浙江的爪牙。章伯钧过去说：“中共可以领导革命，我们农工也可以领导革命。”李士豪也说：“共产党员是特殊材料制成的，我们民主党派也是特殊材料制成的”。大放大鸣期间，章伯钧在北京提出“政治设计院”，李士豪就在杭州叫嚣：“要重新考虑民主党派的作用、地位和与党的关系问题。”章伯钧说国务院拿出的文件都是“成品”，李士豪也说：“省人委拿出来的文件质量很高，无法讨论”。章罗联盟提出：“平反委员会”、“取消高等学校党委制”，李士豪马上号召人们起来“告共产党的状”，“诉共产党的苦”。章伯钧“要办三个刊物”作为反党反社会主义的宣传工具，李士豪随即响应说：“我们在浙江也要办一个像样的刊物”。章伯钧在北京计划发展一、二百万党员，李士豪立即在浙江积极实行“遍地开花、各界铺开”的大发展的方针，对劳改犯、反革命分子、背叛共产党的分子大开方便之门，并用“骗、请、抢、挖、拉”的手段来加速扩充“兵马”。从去年年底起，李士豪逢人便说：“章伯老的情绪大有改变”。李士豪自己也觉得“年老的成员，不再有黄昏的感觉了”，还说：“伯老有我们这些亲信干部，可以好好地干一场了”。
    在党提出整风的方针以后，李士豪就坐着汽车，往来于杭州、金华道上，到处点火，李士豪还发动农工党党员，到医药卫生、文教、工程技术等基层中去点火，并且再三叮咛：“要谈根本问题”，谈“党群关系”，谈“三反”、“肃反”运动中的问题。李士豪在林业厅亲自邀请“三反”、“肃反”对象和对党不满的分子举行座谈会。从5月20日到6月13日短短的二十五天时间内，李士豪就召开了近三十次这样的座谈会，从各方面来发动他的所谓“群众”来向党进攻。
    在日常工作中，李士豪是利用一切机会进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的活动的。李士豪常对人说：“党员不能领导业务”，“党组的意见可听可不听。”李士豪甚至利用职权来篡改党的政策。去年春天，李士豪利用其他几个副厅长下乡推行绿化工作的机会，一个人单独召开全省国营林场工作会议，不顾林业工程技术人员的反对，擅自将浙江几年来根据中央以大力营造用材林为主的林场生产方针，篡改为要开展多种经营，三、五年内达到自给的方针，强制会议贯彻。一年来，这个错误的方针已经打乱了国家林木生产计划，使浙江国营林场不务正业，苗圃不能为造林服务，造成了很大的损失。全省十二个国营林场，有八个林场工人无心培育苗木，却上山去挖竹笋，烧木炭，苗圃里的苗木枯死了就改种西瓜、花生。有的林场感到和农场的生产方针一样，因此积极要求与附近的农场合并。
    李士豪自己常自夸：“我李士豪一生所作的事，是没有一件不可告人的”。可是他哪些东西可以告人呢？这个出身于地主阶级的李士豪从1926年参加国民党第一次全国代表大会以后，不久就投靠了汪精卫，1931年他又加入第三党，进行政治投机。抗日战争开始，他又投靠到军统特务头子宣铁吾的门下。等到抗战胜利，宣铁吾到上海当上海警备司令，李士豪就以治病为名，住进了宣铁吾的警察公寓里，一切费用由宣供给。1948年农工民主党组织被破坏，一些党员被捕，而唯独李士豪却在宣铁吾的保护下，还得到CC系统的农民银行二亿元巨款大做其生意。解放以后一直到现在，他还念念不忘宣铁吾，还不时得到宣铁吾从香港汇来的钱和衣物。
    李士豪的反动罪行已经“铁案如山”，他想蒙混过关是不行的。
