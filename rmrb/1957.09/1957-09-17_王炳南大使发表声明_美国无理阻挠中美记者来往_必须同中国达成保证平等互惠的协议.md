Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, September 16th: Ambassador Wang Bingnan, the representative of the People's Republic of China at the Sino-American ambassadorial talks, issued a statement today. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　During the Sino-American ambassadorial talks held on September 12th, I, representing the Chinese government, presented Ambassador Johnson, the representative of the United States, with a draft agreement on the mutual permission for news reporters from both China and the United States to come to each other's countries for news coverage on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. This draft has been released to the press after the meeting on the 12th.

　　In his statement issued on the same day, Ambassador Johnson stated that the United States could not consider reaching such an agreement with China because, according to him, the United States could not guarantee such reciprocity under American immigration law. Ambassador Johnson's statement is untenable. Everyone knows that equality and mutual benefit are universally recognized principles in international exchanges. Although the methods for implementing these principles may differ from country to country, no country that sincerely seeks to promote international exchanges should obstruct the realization of these principles. Like any sovereign state, China also decides whether to approve applications from American journalists to come to China for interviews based on the specific circumstances of each case, but we believe that this does not prevent China from reaching a reciprocal agreement with the United States regarding the exchange of journalists.

　　The United States, using immigration law as an excuse, refuses to reach a reciprocal agreement with China regarding the exchange of journalists. In this way, the United States cannot escape the responsibility of obstructing exchanges between the people of China and the United States.

　　Ambassador Johnson said that China's approval of American journalists to visit China last year was not conditional on reciprocal action by the United States, as if China did not require reciprocity. In fact, the opposite is true. The Chinese side believes that reciprocity is self-evident. China's initiative last year precisely demonstrates its willingness to take the first step in order to promote exchanges between the people of China and the United States, and to inspire the United States government to take corresponding steps. However, the United States government regards China's goodwill as a sign of weakness and openly declares that its agreement to allow American journalists to come to China for interviews is premised on China not making reciprocal demands. This is an insult to China. The Chinese government insists on the principles of reciprocity and equality in international exchanges.

　　Ambassador Johnson also slandered China for not complying with the agreement of September 10, 1955, and used this as an excuse to refuse to reach an agreement with China on the issue of journalists. However, what are the facts? The Chinese government has consistently faithfully implemented the agreement between the Chinese and American ambassadors of September 10, 1955, on the issue of civilians returning to their countries. Now all American nationals in China who have applied to return to their country have left China. Even the forty American prisoners who violated the law in China have had thirty-four of them released on schedule or ahead of schedule. However, Chinese people in the United States who wish to return to their country continue to be obstructed and persecuted, and the vast majority of them are still unable to return to their homeland. Moreover, Chinese people who have violated the law in the United States have not enjoyed lenient treatment like American prisoners in China; even after their release, they do not enjoy the freedom to return to their country. It is clear from this that it is precisely the United States itself that should earnestly fulfill the agreement.

　　The suggestion put forward by the Chinese side to allow journalists from both China and the United States to come to each other's countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is a practical and feasible suggestion and fully conforms to the desire of the people of China and the United States to increase contact and understanding with each other. The United States' rejection of this suggestion precisely shows that the United States government has no intention of taking corresponding steps to satisfy this desire of the people of China and the United States. On the contrary, it attempts to continue to obstruct exchanges between the people of China and the United States by using new deceptive tactics.

### 王炳南大使发表声明　美国无理阻挠中美记者来往　必须同中国达成保证平等互惠的协议

　　王炳南大使发表声明
　　美国无理阻挠中美记者来往
　　必须同中国达成保证平等互惠的协议
    新华社日内瓦16日电　参加中美两国大使级会谈的中华人民共和国代表王炳南大使今日发表声明。声明全文如下：
    在9月12日举行的中美大使级会谈上，我代表中国政府向美方代表约翰逊大使提出了中美两国在平等互惠的基础上，准许对方新闻记者前来各自的国家，进行新闻采访的协议草案。这个草案已经在12日会后向报界公布。
    约翰逊大使在他同日发表的声明里表示美国不能考虑同中国达成这样的协议，因为据他说根据美国移民法美国不能保证这样的互惠。约翰逊大使的说法是不能成立的。谁都知道，平等互惠是国际交往中公认的原则，每一个国家实现这一原则的办法尽管有所不同，但是任何一个有诚意促进国际交往的国家都不应该妨碍这一原则的实现。中国像任何一个主权国家一样，也是根据每一个申请来华采访的美国记者的具体情况来决定批准与否的，但是我们认为这并不妨碍中国同美国达成有关记者来往的互惠协议。
    美国以移民法为借口，拒绝同中国达成关于两国记者来往的互惠协议。这样，美国就无法逃避阻挠中美两国人民来往的责任。
    约翰逊大使说，中国去年批准美国记者访华并未以美国采取互惠行动为条件，好像中国是不要求互惠的。其实正好相反，中国方面认为互惠是不言而喻的。中国去年采取主动正表明它为了促进中美两国人民的来往愿意先走一步，并且以此启发美国政府采取相应的步骤。但是，美国政府把中国的善意看成是示弱，并且公开声明，它同意美国记者来华采访是以中国不提出互惠要求为前提的。这是对于中国的侮辱。中国政府坚持在国际来往方面的互惠和平等原则。
    约翰逊大使又诬蔑中国不遵守1955年9月10日的协议，并且以此为借口拒绝同中国达成关于记者问题的协议。然而，事实是怎样的呢？中国政府一贯忠实执行1955年9月10日中美两国大使关于平民回国问题的协议。现在所有申请回国的在中国的一般美侨都离开了中国。就是四十名在中国犯法的美国籍犯人，也已经有三十四名按期或者提前得到释放。但是，在美国的愿意回国的中国人却继续受到阻挠和迫害，至今绝大多数还不能回到祖国。而在美国犯法的中国人，也没有像在中国的美国犯人一样，享受宽大的待遇；即使在释放以后，他们也享受不到回国的自由。由此可见，应该认真履行协议的恰恰是美国自己。
    中国方面提出的在平等互惠的基础上准许中美双方记者来往的建议，是切实可行的建议，并且完全符合中美两国人民要求增进彼此的接触和了解的愿望。美国方面拒绝这一建议，正好说明美国政府无意采取相应的步骤来满足中美两国人民的这种愿望，相反的，却企图用新的欺骗手法来继续阻挠中美两国人民的来往。
