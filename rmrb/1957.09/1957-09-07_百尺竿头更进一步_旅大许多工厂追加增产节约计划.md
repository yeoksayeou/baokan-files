    Reaching a Higher Level:
    Many Factories in Lüda Add Production Increase and Savings Plans
    (Our newspaper's report from Lüda on the 6th) A number of factories and enterprises in Lüda City, after having completed their annual production increase and savings tasks ahead of schedule, are now adding additional production increase and savings plans.
    The Dalian Glass Factory originally planned to increase production by 50,000 cases of glass for the whole year, and this plan was achieved ahead of schedule in August. In order to increase the production of more glass for the country, this factory has proposed a plan to increase production by another 32,000 cases of glass by the end of the year. The Liaoning Salt Affairs Bureau completed the annual national plan and the production increase and savings plan ahead of schedule in July, exceeding the production increase plan by more than 37%. However, they were not satisfied with these achievements and put forward a fighting goal: to strive to increase the production of 220,000 tons of sea salt before the end of the salt drying season. In the first seven months of this year, the Lüda Oil and Fat Industry General Factory increased production by 612 tons of oil and fat, exceeding the annual production increase plan by 58.6%. Now the workers are discussing and revising the production increase and savings plan, striving to increase the production of more than 100 tons of oil and fat for the country this year. The Dalian Steel Plant, which felt that there was a shortage of raw materials at the beginning of the year, also overcame the difficulties of insufficient raw materials by coming up with many methods, and completed the annual production increase plan more than four months ahead of schedule, increasing the production of more than 100 tons of steel for the country.
    Although some factories have not yet completed their annual production increase plans, given that production has greatly improved in the production increase and savings campaign and there is a possibility of increasing production, they have decided to vigorously increase production. The Dalian Machine Tool Plant has saved a lot of raw materials in the first half of the year, creating conditions for increasing production, so it has decided to use the saved raw materials to increase production by 100 machine tools in the second half of the year. The Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory originally planned to increase production by 15 steel ingot mold cars, 10 tipping cars, and 66 sixty-ton flat cars, and now it has also decided to use the saved and surplus raw materials to increase production by another 54 sixty-ton tipping cars.

    百尺竿头更进一步
    旅大许多工厂追加增产节约计划
    本报旅大6日电　旅大市一批工厂企业在提前完成了全年增产节约任务以后，又在追加增产节约计划。
    大连玻璃厂原订全年增产五万箱玻璃，这一计划已在8月份提前实现了。为了给国家增产更多的玻璃，这个工厂又提出了到年底再增产三万二千箱玻璃的计划。辽宁盐务局在7月份就提前完成了全年国家计划和增产节约计划，并且超过增产计划37％强。但他们并没有满足于这些成绩，又提出了奋斗目标：争取在晒盐季节结束前，再增产二十二万吨海盐。旅大油脂工业总厂在今年头七个月中，就增产了六百一十二吨油脂，超过了全年增产计划58.6％。现在工人们正在讨论和修订增产节约计划，争取在今年再为国家增产一百多吨油脂。年初深感原材料不足的大连钢厂，也由于想出了许多办法战胜了原材料不足的困难，提前四个多月实现了全年增产计划，为国家增产了一百多吨钢材。
    有些工厂虽然现在并没有完成全年增产计划，但是鉴于在增产节约运动中生产情况大大好转，有了增产的可能，因此决定大力增产。大连机床厂由于上半年节约了大量的原材料，为增产创造了条件，因而决定利用节约下来的原材料，在下半年增产一百台机床。大连工矿车辆厂原订增产十五台钢锭模车、十辆翻车、六十六台六十吨台车，现在也决定利用节约下来的和多余的原材料，再增产五十四辆六十吨翻车。（毛先智）
