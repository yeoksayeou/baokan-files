Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanxi Province's Party and government leading departments recently held a cadres meeting. Wang Qian, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Liu Kaiji, Deputy Governor, delivered reports at the meeting, calling on all cadres and people in the province to save three to five jin of grain per month. The person in charge of the Shanxi Provincial Grain Bureau told reporters that, according to this calculation, Shanxi Province can save more than 100 million jin of grain a year, enough for 300,000 people to eat for a year.

Currently, the collective mess halls of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee organs have automatically proposed grain conservation plans. From now on, each mess hall will save four to six jin of grain per person. Other provincial-level organs are also taking measures.

In this campaign, all localities will carry out extensive publicity activities on grain conservation among cadres and the people, educating the masses to consciously abide by the state's grain system, cultivate the social virtues and habits of cherishing grain, and combine it with the education of running cooperatives and households diligently and thriftily. Agricultural cooperatives' members and urban residents will be universally mobilized to formulate covenants for cherishing and saving grain. All organs and organizations are also preparing to commend individuals and units that have achieved success in saving grain within a certain period.

Since the beginning of summer, most areas of Shanxi Province have experienced drought and little rain, which has greatly affected grain production. In order to combat drought and prepare for famine, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have decided that, in addition to mobilizing farmers to actively fight drought and organizing the masses to collect wild vegetables, wild fruits, and other various substitute foods, they have also decided to launch a long-term grain conservation campaign throughout the province as quickly as possible.

    山西开展持久的节约粮食运动
    省委号召每人每月节约粮食三斤到五斤
    新华社讯　山西省党、政领导部门最近举行了一次干部会议，中共省委书记王谦和副省长刘开基在会上做了报告，号召全省干部、人民群众每人每月节约粮食三斤到五斤。山西省粮食厅负责人对记者说，按照这一数字计算，山西省一年内可节约一亿多斤粮食，够三十万人吃用一年。
    目前，中共山西省委和省人民委员会机关集体伙食单位，已自动提出了节约粮食的计划。从现在起各灶每人节约四斤到六斤粮食。其它省级机关也正在采取措施。
    在这次运动中，各地将向干部和人民群众广泛进行节约粮食的宣传活动，教育群众自觉地遵守国家粮食制度，养成爱惜粮食的社会美德和风尚，并结合勤俭办社、勤俭持家教育，普遍发动农业社社员和城市居民订立爱护、节约粮食的公约。各机关团体等还准备在一定时间内，对节约粮食有成绩的个人和单位模范予以表扬。
    入夏以来，山西省大部分地区干旱少雨，粮食生产受到很大影响。为了抗旱备荒，中共山西省委和省人民委员会决定除发动农民积极抗旱，组织群众采集野菜、野果等各种代食品外，并决定在全省范围内迅速开展一个持久的节约粮食运动。
