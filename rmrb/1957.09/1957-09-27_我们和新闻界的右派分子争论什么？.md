    What are we arguing with the rightists in the press?
    Li Zhang
    In the increasingly deepening struggle against the bourgeois rightists, the serious situation of impure organization and impure thinking in the press has been thoroughly exposed. Not only were the two non-Party newspapers, Wenhui and Guangming, once usurped by the Zhang-Luo alliance; but also many rightists have been exposed in Party newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and journalism education institutions at all levels.
    When the rightists in the press attacked the Party and the people, they waved the banner of "freedom of the press." The rightists insisted, "The Party controls too much, and there is too little freedom of the press." They wanted to "fight for freedom of the press" and drag the people's news media back to the old capitalist road. We must defend the Party spirit of news work and adhere to the socialist direction of the news media. This is the crux of the whole problem.
    Does our country really have "freedom of the press"? Is our country's "freedom of the press" too much or too little? Of course, our country has freedom of the press; our socialist freedom of the press is very abundant, while the capitalist "freedom of the press" is subject to due restrictions.
    In a society with classes, there is only concrete freedom of the press, not abstract freedom of the press. Modern newspapers in China and foreign countries exist and develop as tools of class struggle. Although the publishers of some newspapers try their best to promote "neutrality" and "detachment," in the final analysis, they will always serve this class or that class, acting as spokespersons for this political group or that political group. Capitalist dictatorial countries always desperately develop bourgeois freedom of the press while restricting and destroying proletarian freedom of the press. Proletarian dictatorial countries do the opposite. This situation is the same in all countries, without exception.
    The people of our country enjoy the most extensive freedom of the press. Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. According to the constitution, workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other patriotic people, who account for more than 90% of the total population, all have the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, and the right to express their opinions in newspapers and periodicals. Only a very small number of counter-revolutionaries who are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist are deprived of freedom of speech; only those who incite war, advocate capitalist restoration, undermine the unity of the people at home and abroad, and promote feudal, ignorant, and backward things have no place in our country's newspapers and periodicals.
    The constitutions of capitalist countries also have clauses on freedom of speech. However, the constitution and political life in those countries are often two different things. The bourgeoisie monopolizes all newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, and radio stations, which completely deprives the working class of the right to speak. Take the United Kingdom and the United States, which the rightists deeply admire, as examples. The news media there are highly concentrated. Two news monopoly groups in the United States (the Hearst and Scripps-Howard groups) control 39 newspapers, 3 news syndicates, 9 magazines, 8 radio stations, and 1 news agency. Four newspaper monopoly organizations in the United Kingdom control 60% of the national daily newspaper circulation. Class struggle is the most acute in these countries. Who can say that the bourgeoisie will run newspapers to speak for the working class?
    Some people say: "If you say that capitalist countries have no freedom of the press, why do those countries allow proletarian newspapers to be published?" In countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, there are indeed communist newspapers. However, in the capitalist countries of the 1950s, how much freedom of the press the proletariat has, and how many newspapers and magazines it publishes, does not depend on capitalist "democracy" and "freedom," but on the domestic and international situation of the struggle and the balance of class forces. Moreover, the proletarian newspapers in those countries have to fight against the bourgeois state organs and the bourgeoisie's huge political and economic power, and their situation is very difficult. Here, I will only cite the bourgeoisie's advertising weapon as an example. American journalism textbooks call advertising the "lifeline" of newspapers. General newspapers use more than 60% of their space for advertising, and advertising revenue accounts for 40% to one-half of the total financial income of newspapers. Newspapers that have no advertising to publish are usually unable to survive. Bourgeois advertising companies often use the method of cutting off advertising supplies to resist proletarian newspapers and periodicals, forcing them to rely on donations to make a living. However, this "civilized" method cannot destroy all progressive newspapers and periodicals that have received widespread support from the masses. At this time, the bourgeoisie will tear off the mask of "democracy" and "freedom" and carry out naked political persecution. In March of last year, the US government searched and sealed up the American Communist Party's *Worker* newspaper under the pretext of tax arrears. Powell, the former editor of the *China Weekly Review* in Shanghai, was immediately summoned and charged by US officials after he returned to the United States for publishing news about US imperialism conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and sabotaging the Panmunjom talks. If all the charges filed by the authorities were added together, Powell could be sentenced to 260 years in prison and fined US$130,000. It seems like a big joke. But it most ruthlessly exposes the essence of bourgeois "freedom of the press."
    One of the signs that the people of our country enjoy the most extensive freedom of the press is that they can fully express their rights in newspapers and periodicals. The people have become the most important news figures, which has never happened in the history of bourgeois journalism. As early as 1942, Chairman Mao called on us in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to be most closely linked with workers, peasants, and soldiers, to represent workers, peasants, and soldiers, to sing the praises of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers diligently. For more than ten years, we have acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, giving newspapers a completely new look. Our newspapers and periodicals represent the interests of the people, embody the demands of the people, convey the voices of the people, and depict the lives, labor, and rich struggle experience of the people. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers have gradually trained themselves into excellent contributors and journalists in the practice of linking with newspapers and periodicals.
    Bourgeois newspapers and periodicals in capitalist countries are against the people, and there is no room for working people to speak. In the vast space of those newspapers and periodicals, in addition to a large number of advertisements, there are the whereabouts of dignitaries, anecdotes of socialites, cases of theft and murder, and news of ship and vehicle accidents... Newspaper owners painstakingly collect and publish these yellow and sensational news stories, the purpose of which is to earn the most profit and divert people's attention from urgent political and social issues; they either distort or avoid the issues that the working people generally care about. In July of this year, the United Kingdom began to implement a bill to abolish rent control, which increased the expenses of tenants, who account for about half of the British population, while a small number of landlords could increase their income by about 200 million pounds a year. The British *Daily Worker* exposed this bill in the largest space, calling on tenants to organize and fight. Many bourgeois newspapers turned a deaf ear, as if nothing had happened.
    Of course, not all bourgeois newspapers and periodicals in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are yellow. Some important newspapers, such as *The Times* in the United Kingdom and *The New York Times* in the United States, not only made greater efforts for the bourgeoisie because of their "serious" faces, "fair" attitudes, and "clever" methods, but also confused many well-intentioned readers. *The New York Times* has the slogan "All the News That's Fit to Print" on its masthead. This word "fit" of course has all sorts of interpretations. This newspaper constantly publishes some news about China and the Soviet Union, and even takes the initiative to reveal certain well-known facts, giving people the impression of "fairness" and "objectivity"; at the same time, it publishes more fabricated, distorted, and slanderous news, mixing the spurious with the genuine and smuggling in its own private goods. In those seemingly objective news stories, it also tries its best to paint its own colors, so that readers can draw wrong conclusions from true events. This newspaper introduced the situation of the women's movement in our country in considerable detail on May 19 of this year. It said that women in our country "generally obtained the right to vote" and "got rid of the bad habits of the old social system: forced marriage, prostitution, and old-fashioned female workers (referring to the body search system in factories)..." These are undoubtedly facts. However, its conclusion was: "The price of these achievements is: the sacrifice of all female standards and values, and the deprivation of all human freedom and personal desires."
    Conducting open criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals is another important sign of the most extensive freedom of the press in our country. In order to consolidate the leadership of the Party and promote the socialist cause, the people of our country often use newspapers and periodicals as weapons to intervene in national life, supervise state personnel, and express opinions on various policies. These criticisms and opinions often produce the most positive reactions and effects, and our country's newspapers and periodicals have therefore gained a very high reputation.
    Capitalist countries' newspapers, such as American newspapers, often criticize and attack certain government departments and figures in power. They can even contemptuously call Eisenhower "Ike" and scold Dulles as a "stupid waste." On the surface, it seems very free and democratic. This kind of "freedom of the press" of mutual attacks between various bourgeois groups has the effect of confusing and paralyzing the people, but it cannot change the actions and policies of the bourgeois government. Some people compare it to "dogs biting dogs," which should be said to be very appropriate.
    In order to strive for bourgeois "freedom of the press," the rightists systematically spread the "theory" that news work is above classes. They said that news has no class nature, only commodity nature, and should "record everything heard" and write whatever one wants to write. This "theory" is naturally extremely absurd, but it is not the creation of the rightists, but was learned from their American teachers. American bourgeois journalism textbooks write that the newspaper's editorials represent the publisher's opinions, while the newspaper's news is "fair" and "objective." The bourgeois newspaper's editorials often launch frontal attacks on the working people, but it will even more use news to shamefully distort certain major events. Journalists with different class stances can write a piece of news into several news stories with completely different tones. The so-called "fairness" and "objectivity" really have their own standards. We still clearly remember how terribly the Associated Press reporter Musa distorted the People's Liberation Army's entry into Beijing (then still called Peiping) in February 1949. He said in a telegram sent on February 3: "Today Peiping gave his Communist conquerors a lively welcome... Just as when the Japanese occupied Peiping, they welcomed the Japanese, when the Americans returned, they welcomed the Americans, when the Chinese Nationalists returned, they welcomed the Chinese Nationalists, and hundreds of years ago, they welcomed the Mongols and the Tatars..." What the class nature of news is, is all revealed in this telegram.
    Not only can one thing be written into several news stories with different tones, but a news story can also be handled in several completely different ways in the hands of editors with different positions. Everyone remembers that on May 25 of this year, Chairman Mao met with the representatives attending the National Congress of the Communist Youth League and delivered an extremely important speech. Xinhua News Agency sent a detailed news report about this event. The vast majority of newspapers across the country published this news in the most important position, with Chairman Mao's criticism of "words and actions that deviate from socialism" as the title. However, this news occupied a very inconspicuous position in *Wenhui Bao*, and the title was very small. Contrary to this news, Chu Anping's article on "The Party's World" was placed in a box in the upper right corner of the first page of *Wenhui Bao*, with a large headline. Is this accidental? All the gentlemen who shy away from the class nature of news work, how do you explain this phenomenon!
    In the anti-rightist struggle, people have clearly seen that whoever is most enthusiastic about promoting that news has no class nature must be a rightist with the firmest bourgeois stance. Chu Anping and Xu Zhucheng all promoted themselves with this, but in April and May of this year, they instructed many reporters from *Wenhui Bao* and *Guangming Daily* to go out and set fires, inciting people to make trouble. Isn't this kind of incitement a class nature? Otherwise, why would they be so enthusiastic and hardworking?
    Some rightists say that whether or not "private newspapers" can be organized is a sign of whether there is "freedom of the press." They demand "freedom of the press," so they organize "private newspapers." They describe "private newspapers" as newspapers that are "detached from worldly affairs," which is actually an excuse for them to resist the leadership of the Party. Since it is a "private" newspaper, it must have a common political inclination. Today, it is either the same as capitalism or the same as socialism. There is no middle ground. Before liberation, "private" newspapers appeared in the Jiang (Chiang Kai-shek) controlled areas, among which those who were "the same" as the progressive forces were progressive, and those who were "the same" as the reactionary forces were reactionary. Take the *Ta Kung Pao*, which was the "most influential" at the time, as an example. It touted "intellectuals discussing politics," called itself a "private newspaper," put on a "fair" face, and played the ugly drama of "scolding a little to help a lot." 1946 was the year of the most acute class struggle in our country, and the decisive moment for the success or failure and speed of the revolution. On April 15 and 17 of this year, the *Tianjin Ta Kung Pao* successively published two editorials, doing its best to oppose the Communist Party and helping Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. The editorial on the 15th was titled "Excessive Propaganda," and it severely criticized the *Yan'an Liberation Daily*'s editorial "Refuting Chiang Kai-shek," and also said: "Since the July 7th Incident, President Chiang has always led this arduous eight-year war of resistance. The war of resistance has been won, and all those who participated in the war of resistance have made contributions. President Chiang is one of the main contributors to the country and the nation." It was truly shameless and disgusting. The title of the editorial on the 17th was "The Shameful Battle of Changchun," vaguely shifting the responsibility for the civil war to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and demanding that the People's Liberation Army lay down its weapons and hand over the liberated areas to the "country" of the Chiang family. This editorial was quite emotional. It wrote that the author was reading the endless stream of telegrams, "his hands were trembling, his heart was beating, his eyes were flashing, as if he really saw the bloodshed of the killings, and his nose was sore, as if he smelled the gunpowder smoke..." What kind of emotion is this? It is completely a psychological depiction of Chiang Kai-shek's generation anticipating the end of the world. Can this be called a "private newspaper" that is "detached from worldly affairs"?
    As an excuse to strive for bourgeois "freedom of the press" and restore the appearance of bourgeois newspapers and periodicals, the rightists, on the one hand, promoted that newspapers should be relaxed, novel, "interesting," and "comfortable," and on the other hand, slandered Party newspapers as "full of dogmatism," "without the slightest smile," "a piece of machine noise," and "full of accusations"... In short, they are useless, and no one should read Party newspapers.
    Should newspapers pay attention to layout skills and writing style? I think that all newspapers that have established a correct political direction should be innovative and strive for perfection in this regard. Lively layout skills and beautiful writing styles can cultivate readers' noble interests, improve readers' level of reading newspapers, and better complete the political tasks of newspapers. However, for some newspapers that have gone in the wrong direction, the higher the layout skills, the more likely they are to confuse, paralyze, and poison people; just like sugar-coated bullets, they are easy to hit people's vital parts unknowingly.
    Do some Party newspapers have shortcomings in layout skills and writing style? I think there are shortcomings. Readers have opinions about the dullness, monotony, and dryness of some newspapers. We should make newspapers more lively and vivid. However, the drunkard's intention is not in the wine. The rightists played the trick of stealing the sky and changing the sun here. They want to replace the socialist content of newspapers with bourgeois techniques, which is absolutely not allowed. What is meant by "a piece of machine noise"? Can our newspapers not promote economic construction? What is meant by "full of accusations"? Shouldn't our newspapers explain the Party's policies? What is meant by "without the slightest smile"? Can our newspapers publish yellow news to cater to the low tastes of some people?
    Some journalists regard news work as higher than everything else, are "dissatisfied with the status quo," and resist the Party's political and ideological leadership. In their opinion, criticism should be absolutely free, interviews should be unimpeded, work discipline can be abolished, and the confidentiality system can be dispensed with... In short, everything must obey my needs and be for my convenience. Isn't this a "king without a crown"? After the rightists created the "Zuo Ye incident," many journalists showed such indignation and such extremism. One of the main reasons was that this kind of thinking was at work; as a result, they fell into the trap of others. The people recognize that news work is very important, only because it is an important weapon for the Party and the people to carry out class struggle; the people respect journalists, only because they are the servants of the people and the promoters of the Party's policies. If you insist on putting news work above other work, and regard journalists as a special kind of person, being self-respecting and casual, not doing things for the people, but only causing trouble for the people, it is inevitable that you will be opposed by the people and used by the rightists.
    Some people say that different newspapers should have their own characteristics. This is correct. But you cannot use maintaining characteristics as an excuse to resist the Party's political and ideological leadership. No one opposes that newspapers for different audiences should maintain their own characteristics and personality, and no one advocates that the appearance of non-Party newspapers should be exactly the same as that of Party newspapers. However, in a socialist country, newspapers are the reflection of the socialist planned economy through news media. They should first have commonality, should serve socialist transformation and socialist construction, and should abide by the six criteria for distinguishing between "fragrant flowers" and "poisonous weeds" proposed by Chairman Mao. With common standards, each newspaper can give full play to its strengths, compete with each other, and make the socialist news media rich and colorful according to the requirements of different readers. If you deviate from the socialist commonality and pursue bourgeois individuality, and deviate from the Party's political and ideological leadership and pursue bourgeois "freedom of the press," then you will inevitably embark on the dangerous road of being anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, just like *Wenhui Bao* and *Guangming Daily* in April and May of this year.

    我们和新闻界的右派分子争论什么？
    李章
    在日益深入的反击资产阶级右派的斗争中，新闻界组织不纯、思想不纯的严重情况，已经彻底地暴露出来了。不仅文汇、光明两家非党报纸一度被章罗联盟所篡夺；各级党报、通讯社、广播电台和新闻教育机关中，也都揭露出了许多右派分子。
    新闻界右派分子向党和人民进攻的时候，打的是
  “新闻自由”的旗号。右派分子硬说：“党管的太多了，新闻自由太少了。”他们要“争取新闻自由”，把人民的新闻事业拖回资本主义的旧路。我们要保卫新闻工作的党性原则，坚持新闻事业的社会主义方向。这就是全部问题的症结。
    我国究竟有没有“新闻自由”？我国的“新闻自由”是多了还是少了？当然，我国是有新闻自由的；我国的社会主义新闻自由非常之多，资本主义的“新闻自由”则受着应有的限制。
    在有阶级的社会里，只有具体的新闻自由，没有抽象的新闻自由。中外各国的近代报纸，都是作为阶级斗争的工具而存在、而发展的。尽管某些报纸的发行人竭力标榜“中立”和“超然”，归根到底，他总要为这个阶级或者那个阶级服务，当这个政治集团或者那个政治集团的代言人。资产阶级专政的国家总是拼命发展资产阶级的新闻自由，限制和摧残无产阶级的新闻自由。无产阶级专政的国家则反其道而行之。这种情况各国皆然，毫无例外。
    我国人民享有最广泛的新闻自由。我国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，按照宪法的规定，占总人口90％以上的工人、农民、革命知识分子和其他爱国人士，都有言论、出版、集会、结社的自由，都有在报纸、刊物上发表意见的权利。只有极少数反党、反人民、反社会主义的反革命分子被剥夺了言论自由；只有煽动战争，鼓吹资本主义复辟，破坏国内外人民的团结，宣扬封建、愚昧、落后的东西，在我国的报刊上没有立足之地。
    资本主义国家的宪法上也有关于言论自由的条文。但是，那种国家的宪法和政治生活常常是两回事。资产阶级垄断着一切报纸、刊物、通讯社和广播电台，这就彻底地剥夺了工人阶级说话的权利。以右派分子深深乐道的英美两国为例，那里的新闻事业是很集中的。美国两个新闻垄断集团（赫斯特系和斯克利浦斯—霍华德系）控制了三十九家报纸、三个新闻辛迪加、九家杂志、八家广播电台和一家通讯社。英国四个报纸垄断组织控制了全国日报发行量的60％。这些国家的阶级斗争是最尖锐的，谁能说资产阶级会办了报纸来替工人阶级说话呢？
    有人说：“你说资本主义国家没有新闻自由，为什么那些国家允许无产阶级的报纸出版呢？”在英美等国，确有共产党的报纸存在。但在五十年代的资本主义国家中，无产阶级有多少新闻自由，出多少报纸杂志，并不决定于资本主义的“民主”和“自由”，而决定于国内外斗争的形势和阶级力量的对比。而且那些国家的无产阶级报纸要和资产阶级的国家机关和资产阶级庞大的政治、经济力量作斗争，处境是非常困难的。这里只举资产阶级的广告武器作例子。美国的新闻学教科书把广告叫作报纸的“命根子”。一般报纸以60％以上的篇幅刊登广告，广告费要占报纸全部财政收入的40％到二分之一。没有广告可登的报纸，照例是无法维持的。资产阶级的广告公司经常用断绝广告供应的方法抵制无产阶级的报刊，逼迫他们依靠募捐来过日子。但是，这种“文明的”方法并不能摧毁全部得到群众广泛支持的进步报刊，这时候资产阶级就会撕下“民主”、“自由”的伪装，实行赤裸裸的政治迫害。去年3月，美国政府竟以拖欠税款为借口，搜查和查封了美国共产党的工人日报。前上海密勒氏评论报主编鲍惠尔由于登载了美帝国主义在朝鲜进行细菌战和破坏板门店谈判的消息，回到美国以后，立即受到美国官方的传讯和控告。如果把官方控告的罪名加在一起，鲍惠尔可能被判处二百六十年徒刑和十三万美元罚款。看起来像个大笑话。但它最无情地揭露了资产阶级“新闻自由”的本质。
    我国人民享有最广泛的新闻自由的标志之一，就是在报刊上充分地表现自己的权利。人民成为最重要的新闻人物，这在资产阶级新闻史上是从来没有过的。远在1942年，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中号召我们要最密切地连系工农兵，表现工农兵，歌颂工农兵，勤勤恳恳地为工农兵服务。十多年来，我们按照毛主席的指示办事，使报纸出现了全新的面貌。我们的报刊代表人民的利益，体现人民的要求，传达人民的呼声，描绘人民的生活、劳动和丰富的斗争经验。不少工人、农民、兵士在连系报刊的实践中，逐渐锻炼成优秀的撰稿人和新闻工作者。
    资本主义国家的资产阶级报刊是反对人民的，那里没有劳动人民发言的余地。在那些报刊的浩大的篇幅上，除了大量的广告，就是达官贵人的行踪，名媛淑女的逸事，盗窃凶杀的案件，车船失事的消息……报馆老板煞费苦心地搜集、刊登这些黄色的、耸人听闻的消息，目的是赚取最多的利润，和转移人们对于迫切的政治问题和社会问题的注意；对于劳动人民普遍关心的问题，它们不是歪曲宣传，就是设法回避。今年7月英国开始实施废除房租管制法案，约占英国人口一半的房客因此增加了大量的开支，一小撮房主每年大约可以增加两亿英镑的收入。英国“工人日报”以最大的篇幅揭露这个法案，号召房客组织起来进行斗争。许多资产阶级报纸则装聋作哑，竟像没有这回事情一样。
    当然，英美等国的资产阶级报刊并不都是黄色的。有些重要报纸，像英国的“泰晤士报”、美国的“纽约时报”，由于它们的“严肃”的面孔，“公正”的姿态，“巧妙”的手法，不仅为资产阶级出了更大的力气，而且迷惑了许多好心的读者。“纽约时报”的报头上登着“刊载一切适宜于刊载的消息”的口号。这“适宜”二字，当然有各种各样的解释。这个报纸不断登载一些有关中苏两国的消息，甚至主动地透露某些人所共知的事实，给人造成一种“公正”、“客观”的印象；同时登载更多的捏造、歪曲、诬蔑的消息，鱼目混珠，偷运私货。而在那些貌似客观的消息中，又尽量涂上自己的色彩，使读者从真实的事情中得出错误的结论。这个报纸在今年5月19日相当详细地介绍过我国妇女运动的情况。它说，我国妇女“普遍地获得了选举权”，“摆脱了旧社会制度的陋习：强迫婚姻、娼妓、旧式女工（指工厂的搜身制度）……”这无疑都是事实。可是，它的结论却说：“这些成就的代价是：牺牲了所有的女性的标准与价值，被剥夺了所有人类的自由与个人的欲望。”
    在报刊上进行公开的批评和自我批评，是我国最广泛的新闻自由的又一个重要标志。为了巩固党的领导，推进社会主义事业，我国人民经常以报刊作武器，干预国家生活，监督国家工作人员，对各种政策发表意见。这些批评、意见经常产生最积极的反应和效果，我国的报刊因而取得了很高的威信。
    资本主义国家的报纸，例如美国的报纸，也常常对某些政府部门和当权人物进行批评和攻击。它们甚至可以轻蔑地称呼艾森豪威尔为“艾克”，骂杜勒斯为“愚蠢的废物”。从表面上看起来，似乎是很自由、很民主的。这种资产阶级各集团间互相攻讦的“新闻自由”，很有迷惑人民、麻痹人民的作用，但不能改变资产阶级政府的行动和政策。有人把它比作“狗咬狗”，应该说是很恰当的。
    为了争取资产阶级的“新闻自由”，右派分子有计划地散布新闻工作超阶级的“理论”。他们说，新闻没有阶级性，只有商品性，应该“有闻必录”，愿写什么写什么。这种“理论”自然是绝顶的荒谬，但它并非右派分子的创造，而是从他们的美国先生那里学来的。美国资产阶级新闻学教科书中写着：报纸的社论代表发行人的意见，而报纸的新闻是“公正”的、“客观”的。资产阶级报纸的社论确实常常对劳动人民进行正面的攻击，但它更会利用新闻对某些重大事件进行可耻的歪曲。阶级立场不同的记者可以把一件事情写成几种情调截然不同的新闻。所谓“公正”、“客观”，实在是各有各的标准。我们依然清楚记得，1949年2月人民解放军在北京（当时还叫北平）举行入城式，美联社记者穆萨对这件事情作了多么可怕的歪曲。他在2月3日发出的电讯中说：“今日北平给他的共产党征服者一个热闹的欢迎……正如当日本人占领北平他们欢迎日本人，美国人回来他们欢迎美国人，中国国民党人回来他们欢迎国民党人，以及数百年前欢迎蒙古人与鞑靼人一样……”新闻的阶级性是什么，在这条电讯中合盘托出来了。
    不仅一件事情可以写成几种情调不同的新闻，一篇新闻在立场不同的编辑手中，也能作几种截然不同的处理。大家记得，今年5月25日毛主席接见参加共青团全国代表大会的代表，发表了极为重要的谈话。新华社就这件事情发了详细的消息。全国绝大多数报纸都在最重要的地位登载这条消息，并以毛主席批评“离开社会主义的言论行动”的谈话作标题。但这条消息在文汇报上占了极不显著的地位，而且标题是很小的。和这条消息相反，储安平关于“党天下”的文章，却被文汇报加框放在一版右上角，而且用了大字标题。这难道是偶然的么？一切讳言新闻工作的阶级性的先生们，你们怎样解释这种现象呀！
    在反右派斗争中，人们已经看清楚了：凡是最热心地宣传新闻没有阶级性的分子，必是资产阶级立场最坚定的右派。储安平、徐铸成都是以此相标榜的，可是，在今年4、5月间，他们指使文汇、光明两报许多记者四出放火，煽动人们起来闹事。这种煽动性难道不是阶级性么？否则，他们为什么这样热心和这样卖力气呢？
    有些右派分子说，能不能组织“同人报纸”，就是有没有“新闻自由”的标志。他们要求“新闻自由”，所以组织“同人报纸”。他们把“同人报纸”描写成“超然事外”的报纸，这其实是他们抗拒党的领导的遁辞。既是“同人”报纸，必有共同的政治倾向，在今天，不是同于资本主义，就是同于社会主义，中间立场是没有的。解放以前，蒋管区曾经出现过“同人”报，其中“同”于进步力量者都是进步的，“同”于反动力量者都是反动的。以当时“最有影响”的大公报为例。它标榜“文人论政”，号称“同人报纸”，摆一张“公正”的面孔，演“小骂大帮忙”的丑剧。1946年是我国阶级斗争最尖锐的一年，是革命成败、迟速的决定关头。在这一年的4月15、17两日，天津大公报连续发表两篇社论，全力反对共产党，替蒋介石国民党帮忙。15日社论题为“过分的宣传”，痛骂延安解放日报“驳蒋介石”的社论，还说：“自七七事变以来，这八年多的艰苦抗战始终是蒋主席领导。抗战胜利了，凡是参加抗战的都有功，蒋主席是主要有功国家民族的一个人。”真是无耻透顶，肉麻极了。17日的社论题目是“可耻的长春之战”，隐隐约约地把内战的责任推给共产党和解放军，要解放军放下武器，把解放区交给蒋姓一家的“国家”。这篇社论是颇有感情的，其中写道：作者读着络绎而来的电报，“手在颤，心在跳，眼前闪烁，俨若真见凶杀的血光，鼻腔酸楚，一似嗅到枪炮的硝烟……”这是什么样的感情？完全是蒋介石辈预感末日将到的心理描写，这能叫作“超然事外”的“同人报纸”么？
    作为争取资产阶级“新闻自由”、恢复资产阶级报刊面貌的一个借口，右派分子一方面宣传报纸应该轻松、新奇、有“趣味性”和“舒服性”，一方面谩骂党报是“通篇教条主义”，“没有丝毫笑容”，“一片机器响”，“满纸斥责声”……总之，一无是处，谁也不该阅读党报。
    报纸应不应该讲究编排技巧和文风？我觉得凡是树立了正确的政治方向的报纸，都应该在这方面日新月异，精益求精。生动活泼的编排技巧和优美多采的文风可以培养读者高尚的兴趣，提高读者阅读报纸的水平，更好地完成报纸的政治任务。但是，对于某些走错了方向的报纸来说，编排技巧越高，越能迷惑人、麻醉人、毒害人；正像包着糖衣的炮弹，容易在不知不觉的情况下击中人们的要害一样。
    某些党报的编排技巧和文风有没有缺点呢？我觉得也是有缺点的。对于某些报纸的沉闷、单调、枯燥，读者是有意见的。我们应该把报纸办得更生动、更活泼。但是，醉翁之意不在酒。右派分子在这里玩弄了偷天换日的把戏。他们想用资产阶级的技巧代替报纸的社会主义内容，这是绝对不能允许的。什么叫作“一片机器响”，难道我们的报纸可以不宣传经济建设么？什么叫作“满纸斥责声”，难道我们的报纸不应该解释党的方针政策么？什么叫作“没有丝毫笑容”？难道我们的报纸能够登载黄色新闻以迎合某些人的低级趣味么？
    有些新闻工作者把新闻工作看得高于一切，“不满现状”，抗拒党的政治、思想领导。在他们看来，批评应该绝对自由，采访应该通行无阻，工作纪律可以取消，保密制度可以不要……总之，一切都要服从我的需要，都要为着我的方便。这不是来了个“无冕之王”么？右派分子制造了“左叶事件”以后，许多新闻工作者表现得那样愤慨，那样偏激，主要原因之一，就是这种思想作祟；结果是落入了人家的圈套。人民承认新闻工作是很重要的工作，只是因为它是党和人民进行阶级斗争的重要武器；人民尊重新闻工作人员，只是因为他们是人民的勤务员和党的方针政策的宣传者。如果硬把新闻工作摆在别的工作之上，把新闻记者看成一种特殊的人，唯我独尊，随随便便，不给人民办事情，只给人民添麻烦，就难免要被人民所反对，被右派所利用了。
    有人说，不同的报纸应有各自的特点。这是对的。但是不能把保持特点作为抗拒党的政治思想领导的借口。没有人反对不同对象的报纸应该保持自己的特点和个性，没有人主张非党报纸的面貌要和党报一模一样。但是，在社会主义国家，报纸是社会主义的有计划经济通过新闻手段的反映，它们首先应该有共性，应该为社会主义改造和社会主义建设服务，应该遵守毛主席提出的辨别“香花”和“毒草”的六条标准。有了共同的标准，各个报纸才可能根据不同的读者对象的要求，充分发挥自己的特长，争妍斗丽，互相竞赛，使社会主义新闻事业丰富多采。如果离开了社会主义的共性而追求资产阶级的个性，离开了党的政治思想领导而追求资产阶级的“新闻自由”，那就必然像今年四、五月间的文汇报和光明日报一样，走上反党反人民反社会主义的危险道路。
