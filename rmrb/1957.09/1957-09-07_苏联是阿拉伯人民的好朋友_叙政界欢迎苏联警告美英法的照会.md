Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 6th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar stated on September 5th that he welcomes the Soviet note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the situation in the Middle East.

Bitar said that the Soviet note once again reiterated that "abandoning pressure and threats against Arab countries is the best way to establish peace in the Middle East."

Syrian Minister of Justice Kazbari pointed out that the Soviet Union's renewed warning to Western countries "will be of great significance in countering aggression... Russia has once again proved that it is a good friend of the Arab people and is committed to consolidating world peace."

The Secretary-General of the People's Party, Dawalibi, expressed deep satisfaction with "the fact that the Soviet Union, a major power with a decisive role on the international stage, is safeguarding small countries."

The Deputy Speaker of the Syrian Parliament, Bashur, said, "The new Soviet note confirms that the Soviet Union is on our side. We warmly thank the Soviet Union for its attitude towards the Arabs, and we hope that the new note will be a factor in uniting the forces of peace to protect Syria and Egypt, who are fighting for their own rights, independence, and freedom."

The leader of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, Hourani, said that Western countries hate Syria's liberation policies, while the Soviet Union is with us.

    苏联是阿拉伯人民的好朋友
    叙政界欢迎苏联警告美英法的照会
    据新华社大马士革6日电　叙利亚外交部长比塔尔9月5日表示欢迎苏联就中东局势问题向美、英、法三国政府提出的照会。
    比塔尔说，苏联的照会再次重申，“放弃对阿拉伯国家施加压力和威胁是建立中东和平的最好途径”。
    叙利亚司法部长卡兹贝里指出，苏联对西方国家的再次警告“对于反击侵略将有重大意义……俄国再一次证明，它是阿拉伯人民的好朋友，它致力于巩固世界和平。”
    人民党总书记达瓦利比对“苏联这个在国际舞台上举足轻重的大国维护小国”一事表示深切满意。
    叙利亚议会副议长巴舒尔说，“新的苏联照会证实苏联是站在我们这边的。我们热烈感谢苏联对阿拉伯的态度，我们希望新的照会成为和平力量团结起来保护为自身权利、独立和自由而斗争的叙利亚和埃及的因素。”
    阿拉伯复兴社会党领袖胡拉尼说，西方国家讨厌叙利亚实行的解放政策，而苏联是同我们在一起的。
