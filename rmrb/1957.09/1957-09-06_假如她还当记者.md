    What If She Were Still a Journalist
    Hong Fu
    On May 20th, the Ta Kung Pao published Zi Gang's article entitled "What If I Were Still a Journalist." This article brings up three "news" topics: first, if vegetable cooperation does not eliminate malpractices and vegetable companies are not dissolved, public grievances will not be quelled; second, under the new prices, children are thin and lack vitality; third, the People's Bank savings offices number in the hundreds in Beijing, which is tearing down the socialist fabric. The author, with her "personality" and "instincts" formed by her old profession over many years, relying on her "keen eyes" and wielding her "magic pen," immediately exposed the "current malpractices." Not only that, she also felt that "merely three topics are naturally not enough to express all ideas," and "if colleagues were to investigate and report, I am afraid there would be many who would be grateful."
    Such "hating current malpractices" news coming from Peng Zigang's pen is not surprising. Because in the depths of her soul, she betrayed the Party and the people's cause long ago. She made many "remarks" and expressed many "grievances" about various phenomena in the new society. Moreover, just as dark clouds suddenly rolled in the Chinese sky, she preceded Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou, followed in the footsteps of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and blew an anti-Party, anti-socialist bugle, attempting to incite "journalists in office" to launch a "close combat" against the Communist Party and the socialist cause.
    "What if she were still a journalist?" What would happen then?
    Probably, under her pen, not only would vegetable cooperation have to be dissolved, but also the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts! The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce! Socialist industrialization! And so on, all socialist systems would have to be dissolved completely! Dissolved completely!
    "What if she were still a journalist?" She would "walk on the streets, sit in trams or cars, look and listen to things, street talk and gossip," and without the constraints of "itching to write" and "not being able to express all ideas," she would write some unhealthy social phenomena well in the newspaper, then, you see, how dark, how dark the society is!
    "What if she were still a journalist?" She and her acquaintances, relying on their "news sensitivity and creativity," would "interview every day, delve into problems every day, write every day; the things written would be put in front of the audience, just like laundry hanging on a bamboo pole, people can tell at a glance how much effort was put into this pole of clothes today" (Note 1). That's how the "Ta Kung Pao" was before liberation, why would the Communist Party bother instructing journalists about anything? Look! How free the news was in the old days!
    As the saying goes, "Even a good fart doesn't smell good," which makes sense. If a person is permeated with the decadent bourgeois atmosphere from the inside out, no matter how beautifully they blow, a fart is still a fart.
    Mr. Lu Xun once said: "After the great revolution succeeds, the social conditions ease, and everyone's life has some surplus, then literature will be produced again. There are two types of literature at this time: one type of literature praises the revolution, celebrates the revolution, sings the praises of the revolution, because progressive writers think that society is changing, society is moving forward, and they feel that the destruction of the old society and the construction of the new society are meaningful, on the one hand, they are very happy about the collapse of the old system, and on the other hand, they sing the praises of the new construction. Another type of literature is mourning the demise of the old society—a requiem—which is also literature that will exist after the revolution" (Note 2).
    It is very interesting to compare Peng Zigang, who has always advocated "listing journalistic work as a department of literature and art" (Note 3), with these words to see which type she belongs to.
    In the eight years since liberation, under the leadership of the great, correct, and glorious Communist Party, the new China is building the most beautiful and happiest socialist society for mankind at a rapid pace. People's material and spiritual lives have been improved beyond what they could have dreamed of in the past. The brilliant achievements of socialist construction are truly earth-shattering and world-shaking. All these historical facts have turned into bubbles in Zi Gang's eyes. She tries every means, day and night, to find "current malpractice" news. The matter is obvious. Is she singing the praises of the revolution or cursing the revolution; is she praising socialism or slandering socialism; does she love the Party or hate the Party; does she praise social transformation or hope for the restoration of the old society? It is best for her to answer herself.

### 假如她还当记者

    假如她还当记者
    洪夫
    5月20日大公报刊载了子冈的题为“假如我还当记者”一文。这篇文章拈出三题“新闻”：一曰：菜蔬合作化不去弊，菜蔬公司不解体，不足以平民怨；二曰：新物价下，孩子瘦弱无精神；三曰：人民银行储蓄所在北京有几百个，是拆社会主义的烂污。作者以多年来旧行当构成了的“性格”与“本能”，秉其“慧眼”，操其“神笔”，一下子道破了“时弊”。不仅如此，她还觉得“仅仅是三个题目，自然是言不尽意”，“若有同行们去调查报道，感谢的恐怕大有人在”。
    像这样“痛恨时弊”的新闻，出自彭子冈的手笔，并不稀奇。因为在她的灵魂深处，老早就背叛了党、背叛了人民事业。她对新社会的种种现象，曾发了不少“议论”，鸣过很多“不平”。而且，正当中国天空上突然黑云乱翻之际，她行于葛佩琦、王德周之先，步趋章伯钧、罗隆基之后，吹起一支反党反社会主义的号角，妄图煽惑“在职记者”，向共产党和社会主义事业，来一次“短兵相接”。
      “假如她还当记者”，事情又该怎么样呢？
    大概是，在她的笔锋下，岂止菜蔬合作化非解体不可，什么对农业、手工业的社会主义改造啊！什么对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造啊！什么社会主义工业化啊！等等，一切社会主义制度，都得通统的非解体不可！非解体不可！
    “假如她还当记者”，她就要“走在街上，坐在电车或汽车里，看来听来些事事物物，街谈巷议”，在没有“技痒难忍”和“言不尽意”的束缚下，把一些不健康的社会现象，好好写在报上，那末，你看，社会多黑暗、多黑暗！
    “假如她还当记者”，她和她的相知们，都凭着自己的“新闻敏感和创造性”，“天天采访、天天钻问题、天天写；写出来的东西往观众面前一晾，就好像洗衣人晾在竹竿子上的衣服似的，人一瞅就知道今天这竿子衣服花了多大力气”（注一）。解放前的“大公报”就是这样的，共产党何必多此一举，向记者指示什么的。你瞧！旧时代的新闻多自由！
    俗话说：“好屁也不香”，是有道理的。一个人从里到外浸透了腐朽的资产阶级气息，任凭他吹得天花乱坠，屁还是屁。
    鲁迅先生曾说过：“等到大革命成功后，社会底状态缓和了，大家底生活有余裕了，这时候就又产生文学。这时候的文学有二：一种文学是赞扬革命，称颂革命，——讴歌革命，因为进步的文学家想到社会改变，社会向前走，对于旧社会的破坏和新社会的建设，都觉得有意义，一方面对于旧制度的崩坏很高兴，一方面对于新的建设来讴歌。另有一种文学是吊旧社会的灭亡——挽歌——也是革命后会有的文学” （注二）。
    用这番话较量一下这个素来主张“把记者工作列入文学艺术的一个部门”（注三）的彭子冈，究竟是属于哪一种，倒是很有意思的事。
    解放八年来的新中国，在伟大、正确、光荣的共产党领导下，正以飞速的步伐建设人类最美好最幸福的社会主义社会。人民物质生活和精神生活，有了过去梦想不到的改善。社会主义建设光辉灿烂的成就，真是惊天地而震世间。这一切历史事实，在子冈的眼睛里化成了泡影。她千方百计、昼夜苦寻的是“时弊”新闻。事情是明摆着的。她是讴歌革命，还是诅咒革命；她是赞扬社会主义，还是诋毁社会主义；她是热爱党，还是憎恨党；她是称颂社会改造，还是希望旧社会复辟。最好由她自己来回答。
