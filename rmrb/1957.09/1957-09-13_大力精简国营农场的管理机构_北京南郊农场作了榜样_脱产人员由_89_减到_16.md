Xinhua News Agency, 12th: To vigorously streamline the management structure of state-owned farms, the local state-owned Beijing Southern Suburb Farm has set an example. Under the direction of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the farm has vigorously streamlined its management structure. The number of personnel detached from production has now been reduced from 89 to 16, accounting for only 1.2% of the total number of employees.

　　Among the personnel streamlined from detachment, 30 people were streamlined in April of this year. After the current re-streamlining, the situation of the farm's management structure is as follows: the cadres in the general headquarters of the farm have been reduced from 18 to 8, leaving only two farm directors, one Party committee secretary, one Youth League branch secretary, three accountants, and one secretary/clerk. The farm has four branch farms. The original number of personnel detached from production was 41, now reduced to 8, with only one branch farm director and one accountant remaining in each branch farm. After streamlining the management structure, all 23 agricultural and animal husbandry technicians in the farm have also changed their working methods. They now all participate in labor production and provide technical guidance in actual production activities.

　　While streamlining the management structure, the farm's general headquarters studied and improved working methods, changed leadership style, and simplified many unnecessary meetings and statistical reports.

　　Judging from the situation in the last few days, the farm's streamlining of the management structure and reduction of non-production personnel has not only not weakened the leadership work, but has also greatly strengthened the ties between cadres and the masses. In the past, with a large management structure and too many non-production personnel, many things were pushed back and forth, and the farm director was busy attending meetings to deal with these things. Now, with fewer people sitting in the office, administrative and political work is contracted out separately by the leaders of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League. After the cadres go to the fields to work, many things are resolved at any time, and work efficiency has increased instead.

　　Most of the farm's agricultural and animal husbandry technicians are graduates of higher agricultural schools since 1949 and lack practical production experience. In the past, they spent more than 20 days a month inspecting work in the fields, but each branch farm had 5,000 to 10,000 mu of land, and it was impossible to inspect work in detail; the rest of the time they were in the office writing technical measures plans, production plans, production summaries, and so on. Now it is different. They are working and providing technical guidance in the assigned areas, which is very popular among the workers. For example, many of them did not know how to feed calves, milk cows, or manage maternity wards. In the past, when they went to the cowshed to inspect work, they often could not solve specific problems. Now they all go to the cowsheds and pigsties to feed cows and pigs together with the workers, and the situation is different.

　　The Beijing Southern Suburb Farm is a mechanized farm with more than 29,000 mu of land, more than 1,000 dairy cows, and diversified operations producing large quantities of milk, meat, vegetables, and fruits. The farm has more than 1,300 employees. Except for a loss in 1952, there has been some surplus every year. However, by the end of last year, the farm's off-duty personnel still accounted for 7.3% of the total number of employees, and the management structure was still too large. Since late August this year, the farm's Party committee and administrative leaders have repeatedly studied the organization of the management structure, formulated a streamlining plan, and mobilized all staff to conduct full discussions under the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee. During this period, a large number of cadres from Beijing's municipal organs signed up to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor and were determined to transform themselves under the call of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee, which greatly encouraged the farm's cadres. Many ideological problems in the streamlining process have been successfully resolved.

　　大力精简国营农场的管理机构
    北京南郊农场作了榜样　脱产人员由89减到16
    新华社12日讯　地方国营北京南郊农场根据中共北京市委和北京市人民委员会的指示，大力精简管理机构。现在全场脱离生产人员已经从八十九人减少到十六人，只占职工总数的1.2％。
    被精简的脱离生产人员中，有三十人是今年4月就精简了的。目前经过再次精简，这个农场的管理机构的情况是这样：农场总场部的干部从十八人减少到八人，只留下场长二人，党委书记、团支部书记各一人，会计三人，秘书兼事务员一人，农场有四个分场，原有脱离生产人员四十一人，现在减少到八人，就是每个分场只留下分场长一人、会计一人。精简管理机构以后，全场二十三名农业、畜牧技术人员也改变工作方法，现在他们是全部参加劳动生产，在实际生产活动中进行技术指导。
    在精简管理机构的同时，农场总场部研究改进了工作方法，转变领导作风，精简了许多不必要的会议和统计表报。
    从最近几天的情况来看，农场精简管理机构，减少非生产人员，不仅没有削弱领导工作，还大大地密切了干部和群众的联系。过去管理机构大、非生产人员过多，许多事情推来推去，场长就忙于开会处理这些事情。现在，坐办公室的人少了，行政工作、政治工作由党、政、工、团领导干部分头包干，干部下地劳动以后，有很多事情随时就解决，工作效率反而提高了。
    这个农场的农业、畜牧技术人员大部分是1949年以来的高等农业学校的毕业生，缺少实际生产经验。过去，他们一个月中有二十多天时间到田间检查工作，但是每个分场有五千亩到一万亩地，检查工作不可能细致；其余时间他们是在办公室里写技术措施计划、生产计划、生产总结等等。现在不同了，他们在分配的地区里一面劳动一面进行技术指导工作，很受工人们的欢迎。例如，他们当中有不少人不会喂小牛、不会挤牛奶、不会管理产房，过去下牛棚检查工作，碰上具体问题往往解决不了；现在他们都下到牛舍、猪舍里和工人们一起喂牛、喂猪，情况就不一样。
    北京南郊农场是一个拥有两万九千多亩地，一千多头奶牛，生产大量乳、肉、蔬菜、水果等多种经营的机械化农场。全场有职工一千三百多人，除1952年曾经亏本外，年年有些盈余。但是到去年年底，这个农场的脱离生产人员还占到职工总数的7.3％，管理机构还嫌庞大。今年8月下旬以来，农场党委和行政领导人员，根据中共北京市委和市人民委员会的指示，反复研究了管理机构的编制，拟定了精简方案，并且发动全体工作人员进行了充分的讨论。在这期间，北京全市机关干部在中共北京市委和市人民委员会的号召下，大批报名下乡参加农业劳动，下决心改造自己，对农场的干部起了很大的鼓舞作用。精简过程中的许多思想问题都顺利地解决了。
