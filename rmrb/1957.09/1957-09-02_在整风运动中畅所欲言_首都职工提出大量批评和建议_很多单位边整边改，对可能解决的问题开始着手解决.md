Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. The vast number of workers in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the capital city have, during the rectification movement, put forward a large number of suggestions and criticisms regarding the production, management, and administration of their units, as well as the working style of leading Party member cadres at all levels.

Since the CCP organizations in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city began rectification in late August, the workers in these enterprises have shown great enthusiasm and initiative. In their spare time from production, they have expressed their opinions freely in various forms, such as writing big-character posters, holding discussion meetings, and group meetings. In the week after the rectification began, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, in addition to holding nearly a hundred discussion meetings every day, also posted two thousand two hundred and fifty-seven big-character posters by nearly two thousand workers, raising more than two thousand five hundred opinions and suggestions. The content of the big-character posters is simple and clear, and it has become one of the main forms for the masses of workers in various factories and mines to express their opinions. Now, the walls of canteens and corridors in every factory and mine are almost covered with big-character posters of various colors.

In the midst of the mass airing of views, in order to enable the masses to fully express their opinions, the responsible persons of the Party committees of various units repeatedly made mobilization reports. At present, in the units where the rectification began earlier, such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the state-owned Beijing First and Second Cotton Textile Mills, after fully mobilizing the masses of workers to air their views, generally after about ten days, the main opinions of the masses of workers have been largely expressed. In addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to put forward opinions, the Party organizations of these units are currently studying and solving various problems raised by the masses.

In this rectification movement, the vast majority of Party member cadres in various factories and mines have expressed an extremely humble attitude towards the criticisms raised by the masses. Many Party member cadres have copied down big-character posters criticizing themselves, and some have even written big-character posters expressing their welcome to the opinions of the masses. Some Party member cadres of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant even sought opinions from workers individually, expressing their determination to humbly listen to everyone's opinions and correct their shortcomings and mistakes.

According to the responsible persons of the Party committees of various factories and mines, most of the opinions and criticisms put forward by the masses of workers are correct, and the content is also very broad, including aspects such as increasing production and practicing economy, production management, cadre work style, workers' life and welfare, the Party's political and ideological work, workers' technical and cultural learning, and recreational activities. Among them, the opinions on improving production management and criticizing the work style of cadres are the most numerous.

Many units have classified and sorted the opinions put forward by the masses according to the spirit of rectifying while correcting, assigned special personnel to study them, and are responsible for solving them. Those that can be solved at present have already begun to be addressed. After studying the opinions of the masses, the Shijingshan Power Plant, where the rectification movement started earlier, has determined the first batch of nineteen problems to be solved, put forward specific solutions, designated specially responsible personnel, and some of the problems have now been solved.

All factories and mines have ensured that both production and rectification are carried out without hindering each other during the mass airing of views. On the one hand, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Youth Blast Furnace used the gaps in production to write big-character posters and hold meetings to put forward opinions, and on the other hand, they also strengthened the inspection of production and safety, which not only ensured the normal progress of production, but also increased the production of pig iron by ninety-eight tons within three days of the start of the rectification. Many workshops and work sections in this plant have proposed that it is necessary to have both a mass airing of views and safe production.

    在整风运动中畅所欲言
    首都职工提出大量批评和建议
    很多单位边整边改，对可能解决的问题开始着手解决
    据新华社1日讯  首都各国营工矿企业的广大职工在整风运动中，已经对本单位的生产、经营、管理等方面的问题和各级党员领导干部的工作作风，提出了大量的建议和批评。
    全市各国营工矿企业单位的中共组织，在8月下旬先后开始整风以后，这些企业的职工表现了极大的热情和积极性。他们在生产的空闲时间内，通过写大字报、开座谈会、小组会等多种形式，畅所欲言地发表意见。石景山钢铁厂职工在整风开始以后的一周内，除了每天都分别举行近百个座谈会以外，并有近二千名职工贴出了二千二百五十七张大字报，提出了二千五百多条意见和建议。大字报的内容简单明确，已经成为各厂矿职工群众发表意见的主要形式之一。现在，每个厂矿的食堂、过道的墙壁上，几乎都贴满了各种颜色的大字报。
    在群众大鸣大放中，为了使群众充分发表意见，各单位的党委负责人反复地作了多次动员报告。目前，整风开始较早的单位，如石景山钢铁厂、国营北京第一、二棉纺织厂等单位，在充分发动职工群众大鸣大放以后，一般经过十天左右的时间，职工群众中的主要意见已经大体上讲了出来。这些单位的党组织目前除继续发动群众提意见以外，已经着手研究解决群众提出的各种问题。
    各厂矿企业在这次整风运动中，绝大多数党员干部对群众提出的批评，都表示了极其虚心的态度。很多党员干部，都把有关批评自己的大字报抄了下来，有的还写了大字报，表示欢迎群众的意见。北京第一机床厂有些党员干部还个别地找工人征求意见，表示一定要虚心听取大家的意见改正自己的缺点和错误。
    据各厂矿党委的负责人说，职工群众们提出的意见和批评，绝大部分都是正确的，内容也非常广泛，有增产节约、生产管理、干部作风、职工生活福利、党的政治思想工作、职工技术文化学习和文娱活动等方面，其中有关改进生产管理和批评干部工作作风的意见最多。
    对群众提出的意见，很多单位都根据边整边改的精神，进行了分类排队，专人研究，负责解决，当前可能解决的已经开始着手解决。整风运动开始较早的石景山发电厂对群众的意见进行研究以后，已经确定第一批解决十九个问题，提出了具体的解决办法，指定了专门负责的人员，并且有一部分问题现在已经解决。
    各厂矿在大鸣大放中，都作到了生产、整风两不误。石景山钢铁厂青年高炉的工人，一方面利用生产空隙写大字报、开会提意见，同时也加强了生产和安全的检查工作，不但保证了生产的照常进行，而且在整风开始三天内就增产了九十八吨生铁。这个厂许多车间和工段都提出：既要大鸣大放，又要安全生产。
