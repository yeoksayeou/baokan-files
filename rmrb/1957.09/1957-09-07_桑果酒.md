    Mulberry Wine

    This year, the Suzhou Winery, a local state-owned enterprise, has produced high-quality mulberry juice wine, based on the trial production of mulberry wine in 1955 and after undergoing refining processes such as decolorization.

    This wine has a beautiful purplish-red color, a sweet and delicious taste, and is also inexpensive.

    Jiangsu and Zhejiang have many mulberry trees. Using mulberries to make wine can save a large amount of grain.

    桑果酒
    地方国营苏州酒厂，今年在1955年试制桑果酒的基础上，经过去色等精制工作，制成了品质优良的桑果果汁酒。
    这种酒呈美丽的紫红色，香甜可口，价钱也便宜。
    江苏、浙江桑树很多，利用桑果制酒，可以节约大量粮食。
