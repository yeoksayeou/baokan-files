    Listening to Whom?

    In a certain unit, some people wanted to put up big-character posters exposing the reactionary words and deeds of a rightist element. Upon hearing this, the rightist element said to the leading comrade of the unit, "I beg you not to put up big-character posters about me, or I will commit suicide!" The leading comrade, upon hearing the words "commit suicide," was so frightened that he didn't know what to do and immediately made two regulations: 1. No big-character posters allowed; 2. No public struggle sessions. These two regulations undoubtedly poured cold water on the high-spirited enthusiasm of the masses. However, some people simply couldn't suppress the anger in their hearts and still put up big-character posters. After seeing them, the rightist element didn't actually go and commit suicide…

    However, in the fierce anti-rightist struggle, whose words should we listen to? I think anyone would answer without hesitation: We must listen to the Party and the masses. But, when encountering specific problems, some people, upon seeing rightist elements feigning death, acting half-dead, or playing crazy, fear that the mass struggle will go too far. Thus, they step forward to "protect" the rightist elements from getting through. Some people, upon seeing the rightist elements shedding tears, have a surge of "compassion" and believe that they have truly and thoroughly confessed their problems. …Facts have proven that these comrades have been fooled by the rightist elements; they don't know that the rightist elements' feigned death, crying… and other ugly behaviors are precisely their tricks to try to muddle through. Everyone who loves socialism should proceed from a class viewpoint, discard sentimentalism and right-leaning emotions, and resolutely join the masses in launching a relentless struggle against the rightist elements. ·Hua Shi·

    听谁的话？
    某单位有些群众要出大字报揭露一个右派分子的反动言行。那个右派分子闻风之后，就向该单位的领导同志说道：“我请求不要出我的大字报，不然，我就要自杀！”那位领导同志一听“自杀”二字，就吓的手足不知所措，连忙做出了两条规定：一、不出大字报；二、不进行公开斗争。这两条规定，对群众高涨的斗争热情，无疑是泼了一飘冷水。可是，有些群众实在无法压抑心头的怒火，还是出了大字报。那个右派分子看后，也并没有真的就去自杀……。
    但是，在激烈的反右派斗争中，应该听谁的话呢？我想任何一个人都会毫不迟疑的回答说：要听党和群众的话。可是，在遇到具体问题的时候，有的人一见右派分子装死装活，装疯耍赖，就惟恐群众斗争过火，于是就挺身而出，“保护”右派分子过关。有的人一看右派分子眼泪横流，就大发“慈悲”之心，认为他真的已彻底交代了问题。……事实证明，这样同志是上了右派分子的当；他们不知道右派分子的装死、痛哭……等等丑态，正是他们企图混关的诡计。一切热爱社会主义的人都应该从阶级观点出发，丢掉温情主义和右倾情绪，坚决地和群众一起，与右派分子展开不留情的斗争。　·华实·
