Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Minghui reports: The Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing announced yesterday measures to reduce its existing management personnel by nearly half.

The Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing is a relatively large local state-owned enterprise in the country, with 2,167 employees. After a streamlining effort this spring, management personnel currently account for 9.8% of the total number of employees. This proportion is relatively small among local state-owned enterprises nationwide. After this second streamlining, the management personnel of this factory will only account for 5.5% of the total number of employees. The ninety-eight management cadres who are being streamlined will be sent down to the grassroots level to lead production or directly participate in physical labor.

According to the streamlining plan that has already been determined, the factory's existing thirteen departments will be reduced to five through mergers and abolitions; management personnel will be reduced from the current 212 to 114. Except for the finance, supply and marketing, and general affairs departments, which will be retained, the original planning and labor departments have been merged into the planning department due to the duplication of many tasks. The original production technology department, technical supervision department, and laboratory, for the convenience of production command, have all been abolished and replaced with full-time responsible persons as assistants to the deputy director in charge of production. The original supervision office has also been abolished because its work can be undertaken by the CCP Party Committee.

The factory's adjustment of management institutions and streamlining of management personnel is implemented on the basis of improving working methods and leadership style. For example, the finance department was previously divided into two groups, with uneven workloads. After a discussion by the entire department, it was decided to abolish the group format and adopt a collaborative approach, assigning work by individual; in the past, the department head did not do specific work, but only provided principled leadership. Now it has been decided that the department head will personally take charge of bank loan business; the original material balance account and the warehouse account were duplicated, so it was decided to abolish one. After these improvements, the department was reduced from fifteen to eleven people. In other departments, such as the supply and marketing department, the planning department, and the general affairs department, the department heads have also changed from only providing principled leadership to undertaking specific business. At the same time, various departments have eliminated some duplicate work, streamlined some forms and procedures, and thus greatly reduced personnel. For example, the original planning and labor departments, after merging the institutions and improving working methods, only need five people to do the work that ten people used to do. The supply and marketing department originally had a total of twenty-seven people, but after improving working methods, only sixteen people are needed.

According to the factory负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge), after streamlining institutions and personnel, production command will be more unified and flexible, and work efficiency will be greatly improved.

Yesterday afternoon, the first batch of forty management cadres who were streamlined had already been sent down to the workshops. When the news was announced to the employees by factory director Yuan Zhenming, it was warmly welcomed by the employees.

The Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing has streamlined management institutions many times, but because management methods and leadership style have rarely been improved, the departments have repeatedly requested to increase personnel shortly after streamlining. As a result, the reduced management personnel had to be re-increased. Because this streamlining is based on improving working methods and improving leadership style, many people in the factory call this streamlining a "revolution."

According to the reporter's understanding, the proportion of management personnel in large local industrial enterprises in our country is generally over 10%, and in some enterprises, it is as high as 20%.

Can the management personnel of these enterprises be reduced? The Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing answered this question.

### 改进工作方法　改善领导作风  清河制呢厂大批减少干部  管理人员将只占职工总数百分之五点五

    改进工作方法　改善领导作风
    清河制呢厂大批减少干部
    管理人员将只占职工总数百分之五点五
    据新华社27日讯　新华社记者孙铭惠报道：北京市清河制呢厂昨天宣布了把现有管理人员精简将近一半的措施。
    北京市清河制呢厂是全国地方国营企业中规模较大的一个，拥有职工两千一百六十七人。管理人员经过今年春天的一次精简，现在占职工总数9.8％。这个比例在全国地方国营企业中是比较小的。现在经过再一次精简，这个厂的管理人员将只占职工总数的5.5％。精简下来的九十八名管理干部，将要下放到基层去领导生产或直接参加体力劳动。
    按照已经确定的精简方案，全厂现有的十三个科室经过合并、取消，将只剩下五个科；管理人员将由现在的二百一十二人减到一百一十四人。全厂除财务科、供销科、总务科还保留以外，原来的计划科和劳动科，由于很多工作相互重复，决定合并为计划科。原来的生产技术科、技术监督科、实验室等，为了生产指挥上的方便，决定全部取消，改为分设专职负责人，作为生产副厂长的助手。原来的监察室，由于它的工作可以由中共党委会担负，这次也取消了。
    这个厂调整管理机构和精简管理人员，是在改进工作方法和领导作风的基础上实行的。例如财务科过去分两个组，工作忙闲不均，这次经过全科讨论，决定取消组的形式，采取协作办法，按人来分担工作；过去科长不做具体工作，只是原则领导，现在决定亲自担负银行贷款业务；原来的材料余额账和仓库的账重复，决定取消。经过这些改进，这个科由原来的十五人减到十一人。其他如供销科、计划科、总务科等科的科长，都由过去只做原则领导而改变为担负具体业务。同时，各科取消了一些重复性质的工作，精简了一些表报和工作手续，因而都大大减少了人员。如原来的计划科、劳动科，这次经过合并机构和改善工作方法，只要五个人就可以做原来十个人做的工作。供销科原来共有二十七个人，改进了工作方法，只要十六个人就行了。
    据工厂负责人说，全厂经过精简机构和人员，生产指挥将更加统一、灵活、工作效率将大大提高。
    昨天下午，精简下来的第一批管理干部四十人已经下放到车间。当这个消息由厂长袁振明向职工宣布时，受到了职工们的热烈欢迎。
    北京市清河制呢厂曾经多次精简过管理机构，但是由于管理方法和领导作风很少改进，精简过后不久，各科室又纷纷要求增加人员，结果一度减少的管理人员又不得不重新增加。由于这次精简是建立在改进工作方法和改进领导作风的基础上，因此工厂许多人把这次精简机构叫作“革命”。
    据记者了解，目前我国地方工业大型企业管理人员在全体职工中的比例，一般都在10％几，有些企业甚至高达20％几。
    这些企业的管理人员能不能减少呢？北京市清河制呢厂回答了这个问题。
