Girl's love letters show new thinking
　　Every village has several middle school students,
　　Every family has one or two people who can read,
　　Girl's love letters show new thinking,
　　Young men read the newspaper with clear minds.
　　Sing alone about the director loving the commune members
　　Don't sing about the director's good leadership,
　　Just sing about the director loving the commune members,
　　Going into each home to ask about their well-being,
　　Like children asking their mother if she's warm.
　　The people's interests are the top priority
　　The county committee cadres live for three terms,
　　The masses say he is fair,
　　The people's creation is the top priority,
　　Bearing hardships and difficulties on both shoulders.

　　田头山歌
　　龚治臧
　　姑娘写情书思想新
　　村村有几个中学生，
　　家家有个把读书人，
　　姑娘写情书思想新，
　　小伙子看报脑筋清。
　　单唱社长爱社员
　　不唱社长好领导，
　　单唱社长爱社员，
　　深入各家问长短，
　　好比儿女问娘暖。
　　人民利益头一条
　　县委干部住三朝，
　　群众说他讲公道，
　　人民创造头一条，
　　艰苦困难双肩挑。
