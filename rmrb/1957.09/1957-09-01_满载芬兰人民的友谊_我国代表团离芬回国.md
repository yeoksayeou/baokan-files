Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 30th: The Chinese National People's Congress delegation left Finland by train at noon today, returning home via the Soviet Union. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Finnish Parliament and others saw them off at the station.

When saying goodbye, Head of Delegation Saifuddin said: Our delegation came with the friendship of the entire Chinese people for the Finnish people, and now we are returning with the friendship of your people for the Chinese people. We firmly believe that with the joint efforts of our two peoples, the friendly relations between China and Finland will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

Finnish Parliament Speaker Fagerholm said that the world is full of differences, but there are no differences between our two countries, and there will be no differences in the future. The Speaker also asked Saifuddin to convey his greetings to his Chinese colleagues and the Chinese people.

The day before leaving Finland, Delegation Head Saifuddin held a reception banquet. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Finnish Parliament, the Prime Minister, and others attended the banquet.

In his speech at the banquet, Saifuddin said that after this visit, we have a better understanding of your country and a deeper affection for the Finnish people. We have gained a deeper impression of the active efforts of your country's leaders in adhering to a policy of peace and neutrality and in attaching importance to and promoting the continuous development of friendly relations between China and Finland.

He said that after the delegation returns home, it will surely convey the sincere friendship of the Finnish people towards the Chinese people and the wonderful impressions gained by the delegation to the Chinese people and the National People's Congress.

Finnish Foreign Minister Virolainen hosted a luncheon on the 28th on behalf of the government to entertain the delegation.

Virolainen said at the banquet that the Finnish people are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries. The Finnish people are pleased to have such good friends as the Chinese people in the distant East.

In his reply, Saifuddin praised Finland's policy of peace and neutrality for its contribution to promoting mutual understanding and friendly relations among the peoples of all countries and safeguarding world peace. He also said: During this visit to various parts of Finland, the delegation realized that there are many aspects of the Finnish people's achievements in science and art that are worthy of our study.

On the eve of leaving Finland, the delegation also attended a tea party held by the Chairman of the Helsinki City Council and a symposium held by the Finnish Parliament for the delegation, and visited a farm, a factory, and a children's hospital in the suburbs.
