Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 7th: Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: The flood prevention struggle on both sides of the Songhua River has entered its most tense stage in the past half month, and millions of people are fighting a decisive battle with the flood. A 500,000-strong flood prevention army from 17 cities and counties along the river in Heilongjiang Province has become the main force in this struggle. They have overcome four major risks and rainstorms and are striving for new victories.

In the flood prevention struggle, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and its subordinate party organizations played a core leading role. From the beginning of the struggle, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has been closely monitoring the development of the flood situation, and deploying forces and adopting countermeasures according to the situation. In the flood prevention struggle, the Provincial Party Committee attached great importance to political and ideological leadership, as well as organizational leadership, strengthening people's confidence and determination to overcome the flood. At present, under the urgent threat of the flood peak, the Provincial Party Committee has repeatedly instructed the people of the province to fight the flood with all their strength, strengthen the "four preventions" work of "preventing wind and waves, preventing risks, preventing sabotage, and preventing complacency," and persist in the flood prevention struggle until the final victory. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee also strengthened the specific leadership of the flood prevention struggle in key areas such as Harbin and Zhaoyuan, and through the Provincial Flood Control Leading Department, mobilized 100,000 people and a large amount of materials from all over the province to support the above two places. The main leaders of the Provincial Party Committee, such as the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, the Governor, and the Deputy Governor, often went to the dikes to inspect the work and provided timely guidance on flood prevention at their residences, solving the difficulties and problems in the struggle. Under the strong leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, organizations at all levels had clear direction and acted quickly. Leaders at all levels of all departments personally went to the front line, sharing weal and woe with the people, so the flood prevention army on the front line was in high spirits.

In order to support the flood prevention areas and protect the lives and property of the people in urban and rural areas, 60% of the labor force in the seventeen cities and counties along the Songhua River—the 500,000-strong flood prevention army—quickly organized and went to the embankments within a few days. Many materials were collected at the flood prevention site in just a few days. Many counties and townships temporarily suspended their own work and mobilized manpower and materials day and night to support brotherly regions. After receiving instructions from the province about supporting Harbin with materials, Yanshou County, led by the County Party Secretary, led the laborers through the torrential rain and across the rapids, walking ninety li at night, to send six train cars full of grass bags to the railway station. After the main labor force in many agricultural cooperatives in the areas along the river went to the dikes, the remaining women, children, and the old, weak, and disabled were organized in an orderly manner to carry out drainage and increase production to ensure harvest, so as to ensure that both production and flood prevention were not neglected. On the dikes, after more than ten days of tireless labor, the flood prevention army continued to vigilantly and confidently guard the dikes day and night. On stormy nights, many heroic deeds of rescuing dangerous dikes appeared in Harbin, Zhaoyuan, Shuangcheng, and other places. Shuangcheng County also formed a 12,000-strong emergency rescue team, and many people dived into the cold autumn waters to find and block many hidden dangers in the dikes. In the struggle against four major risks and rainstorms, 170,000 flood prevention personnel in Harbin City have repeatedly rescued the dikes washed away by wind and rain and quickly completed the second phase of dike heightening and reinforcement tasks.

The flood prevention struggle of the Songhua River has received the support of the people across the country. The Central Flood Control Headquarters allocated a large number of materials and sent a group of experts to provide technical guidance for flood prevention work in Harbin. Liaoning, Tianjin, Hebei, Jilin, Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces and cities, at the most urgent moment, provided a large number of flood prevention materials and grain to Harbin. A unit of the People's Liberation Army rushed from afar to Harbin to participate in flood prevention. The Soviet Heilongjiang Shipping Administration sent 12 tugboats, barges, and cargo ships to support the transportation of flood prevention materials. Soviet friends and Korean friends also participated in the friendly labor to support Harbin. These material supports and the province's material preparations made the flood prevention materials abundant, enough to resist the extraordinary flood since historical records. These supports greatly encouraged the people in the struggle.

Now, more than 900 kilometers of dikes along the Songhua River have been universally heightened and reinforced. After many risks, except for a few areas with dike breaches, most of them are safe and sound. The people of Heilongjiang Province are full of confidence that they will maintain vigilance and achieve victory in the decisive battle to defend their important city of Harbin. They will also pay close attention to the persistent high water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Songhua River that is about to appear and make unremitting struggles.

    松花江两岸人民与洪水决战
    五十万大军开上堤防，九百公里堤坝普遍加固
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　新华社记者报道：松花江两岸半个月来的防汛斗争进入了最紧张的关头，千百万人民正在与洪水决战。黑龙江省沿江十七个市、县五十万人的防汛大军成为这个斗争的主力，他们战胜了四次大风险和暴雨，正在争取新的胜利。
    在防汛斗争中，中共黑龙江省委和所属各级党组织起了核心的领导作用。从斗争开始，中共黑龙江省委就密切注视着汛情的发展，并根据情况部署力量和采取对策。在防汛斗争中，省委十分重视政治思想上和组织上的领导，坚定人们战胜洪水的信心和决心。目前，在洪峰紧急威胁下，省委一再指示全省人民全力与洪水作斗争，加强“防风浪、防险情、防破坏、防麻痹大意”的四防工作，将防汛斗争坚持到最后胜利。与此同时，省委还加强对重点地区哈尔滨、肇源等市县的防汛斗争的具体领导，通过省防汛领导部门，调动全省各地十万人员和大批物资支援以上两地。中共省委书记、省长、副省长等主要负责人经常上堤坝检查工作并在驻地及时指导防汛，解决斗争中的困难和问题。各级组织在省委强有力的领导下，方向明确、行动迅速。各部门各级领导人亲自上前线，与民同甘共苦，因而前线防汛大军斗志高昂。
    为了支援防汛区和保卫城乡人民生命财产安全，占松花江沿岸十七个市、县60％的劳动力——五十万防汛大军，在几天内，迅速组织起来，走上堤防。许多物资在短短几天内就调集到防汛现场。许多县、乡暂时停止自己的工作，日夜调集人力和物资，支援兄弟地区。延寿县在星夜接到省里关于支援哈尔滨的物资的指示后，当夜由县委书记率领民工冒着滂沱大雨，涉过急流，步行九十里，把装满六个火车皮的草袋送到火车站。许多沿江地区农业社在主要劳动力上堤之后，留下的妇女、儿童和老弱残废有秩序地组织起来，进行排涝、增产保收工作，做到生产、防汛两不误。在堤坝上，经过十多天不息的劳动的防汛大军，他们继续警惕地而有信心地日夜警卫着堤坝。当风雨急袭的夜晚，在哈尔滨、肇源、双城等地都出现了许多抢救险堤的英勇事迹。双城县还组成一万二千人的抢险队，不少人潜入寒冷的秋水深处，查找和堵塞了堤坝的许多隐患。哈尔滨市十七万防汛人员在和四次大风险和暴雨斗争中，连续多次抢救被风雨冲刷的堤坝并且很快地完成了第二期堤坝加高加固任务。
    松花江的防汛斗争，得到全国人民的支援。中央防汛总指挥部调拨大批物资并派出一批专家对哈尔滨防汛工作进行技术指导。辽宁、天津、河北、吉林、四川、湖北等省、市在最紧急的时刻里，把大批防汛物资和粮食支援了哈尔滨，人民解放军某部从远地赶到哈尔滨参加防汛。苏联黑龙江航运管理局派出拖船、驳船和货船十二艘，支援防汛物资的运输工作。苏联友人、朝鲜友人都参加了支援哈尔滨的友谊劳动。这些物质支援和省里物资准备，使得防汛物资雄厚，足以抵御自有历史纪录以来的特大洪水。这些支援，大大地鼓舞了斗争中的人们。
    现在，松花江沿岸九百多公里的堤坝已普遍加高加固。多次风险，除个别地区有溃堤现象外，绝大部分安全无恙。黑龙江省人民正满怀信心地要在保卫自己的重要城市哈尔滨决斗中，保持警惕，取得胜利。还将密切注意同即将出现的松花江中下游持续性的高水位作不懈斗争。（附图片）
