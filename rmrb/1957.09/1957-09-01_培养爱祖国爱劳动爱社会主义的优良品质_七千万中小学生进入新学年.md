Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The 1957-1958 new school year begins on September 1st.

Throughout the country, secondary schools are prepared to conduct socialist ideological education centered on the struggle against bourgeois rightists for over five million middle school students. Primary schools will continue to strengthen patriotic education and labor education for sixty-five million elementary school students. Various regions are preparing conditions for offering socialist ideological education courses. The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau has already trained 160 political teachers during the summer vacation. Jiangsu Province has selected over 200 primary and secondary school principals, teaching directors, heads of culture and education departments of the CCP county committees, and heads of county education sections for short-term training, after which they will serve as full-time political teachers in various primary and secondary schools. The Sichuan provincial-level organs are also transferring 200 cadres to strengthen the teaching of socialist ideological education courses in middle schools. Relevant departments in Shaanxi Province have decided to transfer nearly 50 college graduates with excellent moral character and academic performance to become middle school political teachers. The work of compiling the content of socialist ideological education courses in various regions is underway.

In this new school year, middle schools across the country will also add basic agricultural knowledge courses, depending on conditions and possibilities. Jiangsu Province has decided to teach two hours of basic agricultural knowledge per week in the third year of junior high school and will organize students to participate in labor in agricultural cooperatives in a planned way, so that theory is linked to practice, and students develop good habits of loving labor. Hunan, Shaanxi, and other provinces have compiled teaching outlines or trial textbooks based on the characteristics of agricultural production in each province.

Before the start of the new school year, the Ministry of Education appropriately adjusted the primary and secondary school teaching plans for the 1957 academic year and streamlined some of the primary and secondary school textbooks. The textbooks for the three subjects of primary school Chinese, history, and geography had problems such as heavy content, deep level, and not entirely appropriate selection of materials, resulting in excessive tension in teaching and learning. After streamlining, the teaching progress can be appropriately slowed down, so that teaching and learning can be carried out more calmly, which is conducive to improving teaching quality. Ten textbooks, including middle school literature, senior high school Chinese history, physics, and junior high school zoology and botany, also had problems of being too difficult and too deep, and the Ministry of Education has also streamlined them. The Ministry of Education is continuing to study how to completely solve the work of adapting teaching materials. The People's Education Press is prepared to print and distribute 252.4 million copies of textbooks for various subjects to primary and secondary schools across the country this semester and is fully prepared. Teaching reference books that teachers have long been eager for, newly compiled this semester include the teaching reference book for the fifth volume of junior high school literature, the teaching reference book for senior high school plane geometry, and 15 other types. These teaching reference books will also be publicly distributed before the start of school. The Educational Picture Publishing House has specially made a batch of new teaching charts for schools. These teaching charts will help teachers conduct visual teaching better.

The number of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools this year has exceeded the estimated number in the First Five-Year Plan. The number of students enrolled in high schools has completed 115.3% of the First Five-Year Plan; junior high schools completed 121.8%. The number of primary and secondary school students has increased by about eight million compared to last year.

This year, the state plans to invest more than 110 million yuan in the construction and expansion of primary and secondary schools. According to preliminary estimates, the newly built schools can accommodate more than 2.89 million students. The state's funding for teaching equipment and general equipment will reach more than 62 million yuan.

Various regions are also paying attention to the development of community-run schools in the new school year. According to statistics from 42 cities and counties in Hebei Province, there are 268 new middle schools, middle school classes, and remedial classes run collectively by the masses. Many schools have adopted methods such as whoever goes to school pays tuition, mobilizing students to bring their own desks and stools, borrowing desks and stools from the school-running unit, borrowing private houses or transforming public property and family temples to solve the difficulties of insufficient funds, school buildings, and equipment. According to statistics from nine counties in Shandong Province, 24 community-run middle schools have been established or are about to be established, which can enroll about 2,250 students; 145 community-run spare-time middle school classes can enroll about 7,250 students. This year, the number of students in community-run primary schools in Hunan Province will increase to more than 310,000, an increase of 200,000 compared to last year. Currently, more than 50 community-run middle schools in the province have applied to the Provincial Department of Education for establishment.

    培养爱祖国爱劳动爱社会主义的优良品质
    七千万中小学生进入新学年
    新华社31日讯  1957—1958新学年从9月1日起开始了。
    各地中等学校已准备对五百多万中学生进行一次以反对资产阶级右派斗争为中心的社会主义思想教育，各地小学校也将对六千五百万小学生继续加强爱国主义教育和劳动教育。各地正为开设社会主义思想教育课准备条件。北京市教育局在暑期已训练了一百六十名政治教师。江苏省抽调了二百多名中小学校长、教导主任、中共县委文教部长、县教育科长等进行短期训练，训练后担任各中小学专职的政治教师。四川省级机关也正在抽调二百名干部加强中学社会主义思想教育课的教学工作。陕西省有关部门决定抽调近五十名品学兼优的高等学校毕业生去当中学政治课教师。各地社会主义思想教育课内容的编写工作正在准备中。
    各地中学在这个新学年，还将根据条件和可能，增设农业基础知识课。江苏省决定在初三每周教授两小时的农业基础知识，并将有计划地组织学生到农业社参加劳动，使理论联系实际，培养学生热爱劳动的良好习惯。湖南、陕西等省根据各省农业出产的特点，编写了教学提纲或试用课本。
    新学年开始前，教育部适当的调整了1957学年度的中小学教学计划并精简了部分的中小学教材。小学语文、历史、地理三科教材存在着分量重、程度深、选材不尽妥当等问题，以致在进行教学时，教和学都过分紧张。精简以后，教学进度可以适当放慢，使教和学能够较从容地进行，有利于提高教学质量。中学的文学、高中的中国历史、物理和初中的动、植物学等十种教材也存在着偏重偏深的情况，教育部也作了精简。改编教材工作，教育部正在继续研究作彻底解决。人民教育出版社准备在这一学期印发给全国中小学的各科课本二亿五千二百四十万册，已完全准备就绪。教师渴望已久的教学参考书，这学期新编的有初中文学第五册教学参考书，高中平面几何教学参考书等十五种。这些教学参考书也将在开学前公开发行。教育图片出版社为学校特制了一批新的教学挂图，这些教学挂图将帮助教师更好地进行直观教学。
    今年中小学的在校学生数已超过第一个五年计划的预计数字。高中的在校人数已完成第一个五年计划的115.3％；初中完成121.8％。中小学学生比去年增加了八百万人左右。
    今年国家计划投资新建和扩建的中小学的资金达一亿一千多万元。据初步估计，在新建的学校里可容纳二百八十九万多学生。国家用于教学设备和一般设备的经费将达到六千二百多万元。
    各地在新学年还注意发展民办学校。河北省据四十二个市、县的统计，群众集体新办的中学、中学班、补习班有二百六十八处。许多学校采用了谁上学谁出学费，发动学生自带桌凳，由办学单位借用桌凳，借民房或改造公产、家庙等办法，解决了经费、校舍和设备不足的困难问题。山东省据九个县的统计，已经成立或即将成立民办中学二十四处，约能吸收学生二千二百五十多人；民办业余中学班一百四十五个，约能收容学生七千二百五十多人。湖南省民办小学的学生今年将发展到三十一万多人，较去年增加二十万人。全省民办中学，目前向省教育厅申请开办的有五十多所。
