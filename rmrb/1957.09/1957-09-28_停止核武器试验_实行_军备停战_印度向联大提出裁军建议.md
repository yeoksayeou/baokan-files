Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 27th: The Indian representative submitted a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly on the 26th to implement an “armaments truce,” demanding an immediate end to the trend of increasing armaments, thereby paving the way for immediately taking the next steps in disarmament.

The proposal puts forward nine specific demands: 1. Ban the further use of fissionable materials for military purposes. 2. Ban the transfer of fissionable materials from civilian storage to military storage. 3. Ban the manufacture and use of nuclear weapons and thermonuclear weapons. 4. Ban the manufacture, use, and transfer of so-called tactical nuclear weapons and thermonuclear weapons. 5. Gradually destroy existing nuclear weapons. 6. Ban the export of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. 7. Member states voluntarily provide military budgets to the UN Secretary-General. 8. Draft a disarmament convention. 9. Due to the need and to help generate trust and security, gradually establish necessary inspection and supervision measures, whether on land, in the air, or at sea.

The proposal also requests the General Assembly to request the Disarmament Committee to immediately report to the General Assembly on the implementation of the above measures and other possible and agreed measures in disarmament, and in this regard to consider whether it is appropriate to recommend convening a special session of the United Nations General Assembly.

On the 27th, the Indian representative withdrew the proposal submitted to the General Assembly on the 25th to immediately halt nuclear tests, and replaced it with a suggestion that relevant countries should notify the United Nations that they are willing to halt nuclear explosion tests under the supervision of a scientific committee. The new proposal believes that there are now doubts about whether nuclear explosions can be detected, so it is necessary to eliminate these doubts and prevent circumvention. The proposal suggests that relevant countries notify the United Nations that they are willing to stop testing and agree to appoint a scientific and technical committee composed of two outstanding scientists from each side and a scientist appointed by agreement as chairman, to report and supervise the implementation of the agreement on halting nuclear tests.

    停止核武器试验　实行“军备停战”
    印度向联大提出裁军建议
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：印度代表26日向联合国大会提出一个实行“军备停战”的提案，要求马上结束军备增加的趋向，从而铺平道路以立即采取在裁军方面的下一步措施。
    这个提案提出九个具体要求：一、禁止再以裂变物质用于军事目的。二、禁止把裂变物质从民用储存移到军用储存。三、禁止制造和使用核武器和热核武器。四、禁止制造、使用和转移所谓战术核武器和热核武器。五、逐步销毁现存的核武器。六、禁止出口核武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。七、会员国自愿向联合国秘书长提供军事预算。八、起草一个裁军公约。九、由于需要和为了帮助产生信任和安全感，逐步建立必要的不论是陆地、空中或海上的视察和监督措施。
    提案还要求大会请求裁军委员会马上向大会报告上述措施和在裁军方面其他可能的和达成协议的措施的执行情况，并且在这方面考虑是否宜于建议召开联合国大会特别会议。
    27日，印度代表撤销了25日向大会提出的立即停止核试验的提案，而代之以建议有关国家应该通知联合国它们愿意在一个科学委员会的监督下停止核爆炸试验。新提案认为，现在有人对能不能侦查出核爆炸表示怀疑，因此需要消除这些怀疑以及预防规避。提案建议有关国家通知联合国它们愿意停止试验，并且同意任命一个由每方派两位杰出的科学家和一位经协议任命的科学家为主席组成的科学和技术委员会，以便汇报和监督关于停止核试验协议的执行情况。
