Flood Control Standards and Reservoirs
Gu Wenshu

Our country's flood control construction has made great progress in the short few years since liberation. However, the practical test of several major floods has also exposed some weaknesses in these projects. The author now puts forward some superficial opinions on the issue of flood control based on personal observations, and requests comments from relevant parties and the general readership.

Designing according
to flood conditions
occurring once in a
thousand years results
in excessively high standards.

When carrying out flood control planning, the first thing to determine is the flood control standard, that is, to study how much flood to defend against. This is the economic basis for designing all flood control projects. In the past, there was relatively little research in this area. Many plans adopted flood control standards not based on economic analysis results, but rather emphasized safety, with standards ranging from preventing floods occurring once in a hundred years to once in a thousand years. This excessively high standard is detrimental to the flood control cause. This is primarily because areas in our country that may suffer from flood disasters are very widespread. If all areas threatened by floods are required to build flood control projects with excessively high standards, it will be impossible according to the country's material and financial resources. Secondly, high flood control standards often impose difficult-to-meet requirements on the comprehensive utilization of reservoirs, severely restricting the rational development of other water conservancy projects. Third, plain areas in the major river basins of our country suffer from very serious waterlogging disasters. The current drainage standards are relatively low, generally only considering the removal of internal waterlogging that occurs once every five or ten years. According to common sense, when a major flood occurs, internal waterlogging disasters must also be very serious. In this case, adopting high-standard flood control projects can only solve the flood problem, but not the waterlogging problem. Therefore, it is worth studying how much actual benefit can be obtained.

What standard should be adopted for flood control? This should be determined based on the importance of the protected object and the country's technical and economic conditions, after detailed analysis and economic comparison. Generally speaking, in the near future, a combination of universal flood control and key flood control can be adopted.

Universal flood control involves adopting lower standards in most areas, combined with drainage and small-scale water conservancy projects. For example, defending against floods that occur once every ten or twenty years. The projects needed to defend against this type of flood are relatively simple, and most can be completed by mobilizing the masses. In the context of our country's vast territory, widespread flood disasters, and limited economic conditions, this is the fastest and more realistic approach. Moreover, its effect is not bad. Flood disasters are currently very frequent in many areas, leaving the people exhausted. If flood control capabilities can be raised to defend against floods that occur once every ten or twenty years, the people can have opportunities to recuperate, and the state and people can accumulate some reserves in terms of material and financial resources. When encountering a major flood again, the country's economic situation will not be very strained.

Key flood control refers to adopting relatively high standards in areas where the nature of flood disasters is particularly severe, within the limits of the country's economic and technical conditions. In the next few years, the focus can be placed on the treatment of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Because if the Yellow River breaches its banks and changes course, it can reach Tianjin in the north and seize the Huai River in the south, the seriousness of the consequences is unimaginable and must be addressed as soon as possible.

When planning long-term flood control measures, the standards can certainly be raised somewhat; however, it is not necessarily the case that all floods must be prevented that occur more than once every hundred years. Because the occurrence of extreme floods is accidental, it is sometimes possible to consider allowing some areas to be flooded in the event of an extreme flood. Some comrades now often emphasize that people will die when floods strike, in order to defend raising flood control standards. In reality, whether or not deaths can be avoided mainly depends on whether effective preventive measures can be taken in advance. Relying solely on raising flood control standards cannot completely solve the problem.

Flood control cannot rely solely on reservoirs

Many people now lack confidence in relying on levees to defend against floods and hope to build reservoirs upstream to intercept floods. Of course, using reservoirs to store floodwaters is an effective method, but the following factors must be considered when building reservoirs:

1.  There must be suitable terrain and geological conditions, and the reservoir's geographical location must be advantageous. If the reservoir controls a small watershed area or is far from the location where the flood disaster occurs, then its flood control performance will be poor, and the flood control effect will not be great.

2.  To form a reservoir, especially a large reservoir, requires the construction of huge dam projects, and sometimes large areas of land upstream of the reservoir must be submerged, which is very costly. If a large reservoir is built solely for flood control, it is neither economical nor easy to achieve.

From the above analysis, it can be seen that using reservoirs for flood storage must meet certain conditions. However, many river plans currently have a tendency to over-rely on reservoirs to solve problems. Many of the mountain valley reservoirs that have been built and will be built in the Huai River plan control very small watershed areas, but are quite expensive. There are many problems in terms of the flood control effect they provide and the economic benefits. Large-scale reservoir projects require the state to make huge investments and can only be decided upon on the premise of fully leveraging the benefits of comprehensive utilization. Building a reservoir should simultaneously be able to generate electricity and irrigate. This will not only promote the development of industry and agriculture, but also bring huge direct fiscal revenue to the state, enabling construction investment to be recovered quickly. If high-cost large reservoirs are built solely for flood control purposes, it is easy to make the country's funds stagnate and accumulate. According to my understanding, depending on local conditions, many mass flood control measures can be found that require less investment, produce faster results, and are more economical and reasonable. Such as using lakes and depressions for flood storage and land reclamation, repairing and strengthening levees; organizing small-scale water conservancy projects and mass soil and water conservation projects, etc., which in many cases can replace large-scale water conservancy projects and achieve good flood control results.

    防洪标准及水库
    顾文书
    我国防洪建设在解放后短短几年内有很大的进展。但是，经历过几次大水的实际考验也暴露了这些工程的一些弱点。作者现就个人见闻所及，对于防洪问题提出一些粗浅的意见，请有关方面和广大读者指正。
    按千百年一遇
    的洪水情况作设
    计，标准过高
    在进行防洪规划时，首先要确定防洪标准，即研究防御多大的洪水。这是设计一切防洪工程的经济依据。过去在这方面研究得比较少。有许多规划采取的防洪标准，不是根据经济分析结果确定，而是强调安全，低则防百年一遇的洪水，高则防千年一遇的洪水。这种过高的标准，对于防洪事业是不利的。这首先因为我国可能遭受洪水灾害的地区很普遍，如果受洪水威胁的地区都要求修建标准过高的防洪工程，按照国家的物力财力，是不可能的。其次，防洪标准定得高，对综合利用水库往往提出很难满足的要求，严重地限制了其他水利事业的合理发展。第三，我国各大河流域的平原地区，渍涝灾害非常严重。目前所定的排涝标准都比较低，一般只考虑排除五年或十年一遇的内水。根据常理判断，当发生特大洪水的时候，内涝灾害一定也很严重。在这种情况下，采取了高标准的防洪工程，只能解决洪水问题，而不能解决内涝问题。这样，究竟能获得多大实际效益，是值得研究的。
    防洪究竟应该采用什么样的标准呢？这要根据防护对象的重要性以及国家的技术经济条件，经过详细分析，进行经济比较，才能确定。一般地说来，在近期内可以采取普遍防洪和重点防洪相结合的方针。
    普遍防洪就是在绝大部分地区内，结合排涝和小型水利工程，采用较低的标准。例如防御十年或二十年一遇的洪水。防御这种洪水需要的工程比较简单，大部分可以动员群众力量来完成。在我国幅员广大、洪灾普遍以及经济条件不大充裕的情况下，这是一种最快的也是比较现实的办法。而且，它的效果也不坏。现在很多地区的洪水灾害非常频繁，使人民疲于奔命。如果能把防洪能力提高到防御十年或二十年一遇的洪水，则人民可以有养息的机会，在物力财力方面国家和人民也都可以进行一些储备，再逢到大水时，国家的经济情况就不至于很紧张。
    重点防洪是指在洪水灾害性质特别严重的地区，在国家经济和技术条件容许的情况下，可以采用比较高的标准。在今后几年内，重点可以放在整治黄河下游。因为如果黄河决口改道，北可达天津，南可夺淮河，其后果之严重是不能设想的，必须尽早治理。
    在规划远景防洪措施方案时，当然标准可以提高一些；但也并不一定都非防百年以上的洪水不可。因为特大洪水的发生是带有偶然性的，所以有时也可以考虑在遭遇特大洪水时容许淹没一部分，现在有些同志往往强调洪水袭来时要死人，来为提高防洪标准辩护。实际上能不能避免死人，主要决定于事先能不能采取有效的预防措施，单纯依靠提高防洪标准是不能完全解决的。
        防洪不能单靠水库
    现在有很多人对依靠堤防防御洪水的信心不足，希望在上游修建水库拦蓄洪水。当然利用水库蓄洪是一个有效的办法，但是修筑水库必须考虑下列因素：
    一、必须有适当的地形地质条件，而且水库的地理位置必须优越。如果水库控制的流域面积很小，或离开发生水灾地点较远，那么，控制洪水的性能就差，防洪的作用不会很大。
    二、要形成一个水库，尤其是大型水库，需要修建巨大的堤坝工程，有时要在水库上游淹没大片的土地，它的代价是很昂贵的。如果单独为了防洪而修建大水库，既不经济，也不容易实现。
    从以上分析可以知道，利用水库蓄洪，应具备一定的条件。但是目前许多河流规划中有过分依靠水库解决问题的倾向。像淮河规划中许多已建和将建的山谷水库，控制的流域面积都很小，而造价相当高，不论从所起的防洪作用或从经济效果来讲，都是有很多问题的。大型水库工程需要国家付出巨大的投资，只有在充分发挥综合利用的效益的前提下才能决定兴建。修筑一个水库，应当同时能够发电和灌溉。这样不仅能推动工农业的发展，而且能给国家直接带来巨大的财政收入，使建设投资能很快的收回。如果只是为了防洪目的而修建造价很高的大水库，很容易使国家的资金呆滞积压起来。据我了解，根据各地不同的条件，可以找到不少投资少、收效快、更经济、更合理的群众性防洪措施。如利用湖泊洼地蓄洪垦殖，培修堤防；举办小型水利工程和群众性的水土保持工程等等，在很多情况下都可以代替大型水利工程，取得良好的防洪效果。
