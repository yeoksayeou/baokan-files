    History Records It Thus
    ——The Superiority of Socialism Seen From the Achievements of Water Conservancy Construction——
    Xian Liu, Zheng Zhang, Zhong Xi, Hong Ya
    The water conservancy construction of the past eight years is only a beginning for our great future. However, the achievements gained in this short eight years have surpassed the thousands of years of history.

    However, some right-wing elements are shouting things like "Socialism is inferior to capitalism," "New China is inferior to old China," "Water control has brought disasters," and so on. Water conservancy builders, especially workers and farmers who have been engaged in water conservancy construction for many years, cannot agree to such slander. The people in the Huai River, Yellow River, Yangtze River, Hai River, and Liao River basins, as well as the broad masses of people in the countryside who have benefited from water control, also cannot agree to it.

    A New Chapter Written on the Traces of History
    Our ancestors left us many valuable water conservancy projects and valuable water control experience in thousands of years of struggle against floods and droughts. However, during the Kuomintang rule, many ancient water conservancy projects were destroyed, and irrigation and shipping projects gradually became ineffective. Some were even occupied by bureaucrats and landlords, causing water disputes. Take the Dujiangyan Irrigation System as an example. Such an ancient project, famous both at home and abroad for its reasonable planning, scientific design, and significant benefits, also suffered a great reduction in effectiveness due to the poor management of the Kuomintang government: the irrigated area shrank from the original three million mu to 1.9 million mu, and most of it was controlled by landlords and gentry, who exploited the water-using farmers. More than 100,000 mu of farmland were often subjected to floods, turning the originally complete canal system into a fragmented mess.

    In 1949, as soon as liberation came, the People's Government allocated 3 million catties of rice as funding to comprehensively renovate the Dujiangyan canals, built two new-style sluice gates on the Puyang and Zouma main canals, and opened three new irrigation areas, Guanquan Yan, Sanhe Yan, and expanded the Tongji Yan, expanding the irrigated area by 5.6 million mu, allowing the Chengdu Plain to retain its reputation as the "Land of Abundance."

    The Grand Canal, which historically connected north and south transportation, suffered from damaged navigation facilities and broken embankments. Floodwaters often overflowed the dikes, causing disasters. The Kuomintang reactionaries only repaired the Liu Laojian and Huaiyin ship locks, using them to collect boat fees. When the canal returned to the hands of the people, we only spent a few years not only repairing these dilapidated ship locks, but also building new ship locks in Huaian, Xiannvmiao, and Shaobo. More than half of the 2,000-kilometer-long canal has been restored to navigation. The People's Government also vigorously renovated the severely damaged embankments on both sides to ensure that the Shandong and Subei Lixiahe sections of the canal would not be affected by disasters during the flood season.

    Speaking of the achievements in water conservancy infrastructure construction since liberation, they are even greater. During the period of national economic recovery, the state invested huge amounts of money to manage the Huai River, Hai River, Liao River, as well as the Yangtze River and Yellow River. Moreover, in solving the flood problem of rivers, a fundamental treatment method was adopted. In order to free themselves from floods forever, tens of thousands to millions of organized farmers fought on the thousands-of-miles-long Huai River construction site with selfless labor spirit. Hundreds of thousands of workers and students also volunteered to come to remote villages and valleys to engage in arduous water conservancy construction work. Many city factories were also busy day and night to supply water conservancy construction materials in a timely manner. Doesn't all of this clearly show that the people's democratic system is the source of power for water conservancy construction?

      Unbearable to Recall the Past
    In the years of feudal dynasty rule in old China, some projects were also built. For example, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, in order to transport the grain collected from Jiangnan to Beijing for the enjoyment of the imperial family, the Hongze Lake Dam of the Huai River was specially raised and thickened with stone to raise the water level of the waterway. The Yellow River was治理 in the Ming Dynasty to protect the Fengyang Imperial Mausoleum and the grain transportation waterway of the Grand Canal between the Huai and Yellow Rivers. In the Qing Dynasty, a stone embankment was built on the north bank of the Yongding River, while only an earthen embankment was built on the south bank, because the north bank protected the imperial capital, while the south bank was inhabited by ordinary people.

    During the Kuomintang rule, not only was the management of rivers not valued by the reactionary government, but many management plans proactively proposed by water conservancy experts enthusiastic about managing the Yellow River were also ignored. The bigwigs of the "Huai River Management Committee" took the opportunity of "Huai River Management" to issue water conservancy public bonds and extorted more than 20 million silver dollars. They invited American experts, but only built five "return-to-sea dams" on the Grand Canal that had no effect and instead directed water into farmland. Every time the dams were opened to release water, the farmland in more than ten counties east of Lixiahe in northern Jiangsu turned into a seabed. In addition, the Kuomintang also added some new soil to several sections of the Huai River embankment, but even this was an opportunity for the Huai River Management bigwigs and foremen to make a fortune. Listen to the accusations of the migrant workers at that time: "The Huai River Management bigwigs hurt people, the district chief builds a mansion, the township chief builds a tiled house, and the 'small coolies' starve to death!"

    Indeed, the Kuomintang did all kinds of bad things in water conservancy. In 1938, when the Japanese devils attacked, the Kuomintang actually blew up the Huayuankou Dam on the Yellow River, causing the turbid Yellow River water to flood the Huai River basin in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, flooding 81 million mu of land, killing 980,000 people, and turning the Huai River basin into a disaster area of "major floods in heavy rains, minor floods in light rains, and droughts in no rains."

    Things That Have Never Happened in the History of Chinese Water Conservancy
    In the eight years since liberation, seven large reservoirs have been built on the Huai River, including Baisha, Banqiao, Shimantan, Boshan, Nanwan, Foziling, and Meishan. The Xianghongdian and Mozitan reservoirs, which have been able to block floods during this year's flood season, are also under construction. The Guanting Reservoir has been built on the Yongding River, and the Dahuo House Reservoir on the Hun River, a tributary of the Liao River, has also begun to block floods this year. These twelve large reservoirs that have been built and are under construction can store a total of more than 100 billion cubic meters of floodwater. These reservoirs are artificially controlled lakes for storing floodwater.

    Reservoirs have never existed in the history of water conservancy in old China. Take the Guanting Reservoir as an example. From the Northern Warlords to the Kuomintang, and even the Japanese Empire, they had always talked about building the Guanting Reservoir, but until liberation, not even the rock cores for the dam site had been taken out. However, the People's Government only spent two years to build the Guanting Reservoir, which can store 2.27 billion cubic meters of water.

    In the past eight years, eleven large-scale sluice gates have also been built on the Huai River, Yangtze River, Han River, and Hai River, including the Sanhe Sluice Gate, Jianheji Diversion Sluice Gate, the flood diversion gate and control gate of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Gate, and the Duliu River Flood Diversion Gate, and sixty-five medium-sized sluice gates. These sluice gates were built to control the storage, diversion, and drainage of water in the plains and lake areas. When the Yangtze River floods, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion can divert 6 billion cubic meters of floodwater into the flood diversion area, ensuring the safety of the Jingjiang Dam and 8 million mu of farmland and 3 million people outside the dam. The Dujiatai Flood Diversion Area in the lower reaches of the Han River can divert 2.2 billion cubic meters of Han River floodwater into the flood diversion area, ensuring the safety of agricultural production in more than fifteen counties and changing the situation of "Shahu Mianyangzhou, nine harvests out of ten years."

    The construction of such new-style sluice gates in old China was also unheard of. To this day, we still remember the story of the Kuomintang building the Sanhe Movable Dam. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries borrowed money from the United States in the name of building the Sanhe Movable Dam, recruited troops and bought horses, and established a huge organization. They loudly promoted the construction of the movable dam at Sanhekou, but only drove a few piles in several years. What a ridiculous hoax!

    Under the leadership of the People's Government, the Sanhe Sluice Gate, which is more than 670 meters long and entirely made of reinforced concrete, was completed in less than ten months. Not only can it divert 7,800 cubic meters of water per second into the Yangtze River during the Huai River flood season, but it can also block the Huai River in Hongze Lake after the flood season so that the Subei Irrigation Main Canal can draw water to irrigate more than 20 million mu of farmland through the Gaoliangjian water intake gate at the head of the canal.

      In Order to Subdue the Rivers
    We also focus on the consolidation of river courses and embankments. In the past eight years, the country has completed 8.5 billion cubic meters of earthwork, more than 100 million cubic meters of stonework, and 2.55 million cubic meters of concrete. If these earthwork, stonework, and concrete were connected according to a cubic volume, it would be almost equal to 216 times the length of the Earth's equator.

    In the past eight years, the total length of embankments repaired on the Huai River has reached 3,000 kilometers, 298 rivers and沟洫 have been consolidated and excavated, with a total length of 6,300 kilometers. At the same time, 160 culverts and sluice gates, as well as some reservoirs and more than ten lake and depression projects, have been built. This can prevent the Huai River from being hit by floods once every fifty years, fundamentally changing the fate of "major floods in heavy rains, minor floods in light rains, no floods in no rains" and "minor disasters in five years, major disasters in ten years, and special disasters in a hundred years."

    In the past three thousand years, the Yellow River has had a major flood almost every two years. Since liberation in 1946, we have repaired 1,822 kilometers of dams on both sides of the Yellow and Qin Rivers in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and converted more than 4,800 unconsolidated grass dikes into stone dikes. A total of more than 150 million cubic meters of earthwork has been done, enabling the Yellow River to defend against floods larger than those in 1931 since there have been hydrological records. At the same time, flood storage projects were established in Dongping Lake and Beijin Dam, and irrigation and shipping projects such as Huayuankou silt irrigation and Dayuzhang's diversion of the Yellow River to irrigate Jiwei were established. Due to the role of these projects, the Yellow River has not experienced a single flood in the past ten years.

    In the Yangtze River basin, since 1951, in addition to the construction of three flood storage and diversion projects with a total storage capacity of more than 13 billion cubic meters, the embankments and bank protection, and other earthwork projects have been comprehensively renovated. In the past few years, more than 950 culverts and sluice gates have been built, so that some important sections of the Yangtze River embankments have been raised to the height of the flood level above 1954, and the general sections have exceeded the flood level of 1931.

    In the Hai River system, since liberation, in addition to the construction of the Guanting Reservoir and the Tuhe Reservoir near Tangshan for flood storage, great efforts have been made to carry out river closure and embankment restoration, the consolidation of the Yongding New Flood Zone, the dredging of the Jinzhong River, and the river consolidation project of the Chaobai River. In order to reduce the threat to Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway after the confluence of the Daqing River and Ziya River floods, a 40-kilometer-long Duliu River diversion project and the expansion of the South Canal Sinvsi River diversion project were newly opened. The embankments of other rivers in the Hai River have also been largely consolidated with lime soil, bricks, and stones, greatly improving flood resistance.

    The embankments of various rivers in the Northeast region have also been subjected to annual maintenance projects.

    What did the Kuomintang government do in the consolidation of river courses and embankments? The Kuomintang once excavated an extremely narrow river channel in the abandoned Yellow River that could only pass 50 cubic meters of water per second. However, this river channel, which was not very helpful for draining the Huai River floods, was quickly silted up.

    In the past years, the Kuomintang government not only did not build any projects, but also did not leave any useful water control data such as hydrology and topography that were necessary for water conservancy construction. The new China's water conservancy construction had to start from scratch. In the past eight years, the state has organized a huge survey and measurement team, with a plane survey of 10,200 square kilometers, a route survey of 10,000 kilometers, a topographic survey of 560,000 kilometers, a level survey of 190,000 kilometers, a triangulation survey of 570,000 points, and the establishment of 6,640 hydrological stations. These achievements were all exchanged for by the hard work of countless survey team members.

  Floods Tested Two Different Social Systems
    Floods are ruthless, and they have severely tested two different social systems.

    History records it thus: from 206 BC to 1936 AD, China experienced 1,031 major floods. In 1931, a particularly large flood occurred in the Yangtze River, not only did the dikes break everywhere, but even Wuhan and Nanjing, the seat of the Kuomintang government, were flooded for four months, and 121.15 million mu of farmland were flooded. The flood that occurred in the Yangtze River in 1954 after liberation was much larger than that in 1931. The water level at Wuhan Guan exceeded the water level in 1931 by more than one meter, but due to the four openings of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and the heroic defense of the 300,000-strong flood control army composed of party, government, army, and civilians, the entire Yangtze River and the major cities along the coast were safe and sound. During the Huai River flood in 1931, raging waves broke into Bengbu, collapsed the Jinpu Railway, flowed straight to northern Jiangsu, broke through the Grand Canal embankments, and swept across the Lixiahe area, submerging 715.4 million mu of farmland and affecting 18.42 million people. The Huai River flood in 1954 was also much larger than that in 1931, but the entire main dike of the Huai River did not breach, and Bengbu and Jinpu Road were safe as usual.

    The Yongding River and Daqing River floods in 1917 and 1939 both flooded Tianjin, and the Beijing-Tianjin railway traffic was cut off. In 1953, the Yongding River experienced an even larger flood, but the Guanting Reservoir, which was under construction, blocked the flood, thus ensuring the safety of Tianjin, the Beijing-Tianjin Railway, and the lower reaches of the Yongding River. In 1956, the entire Hai River system experienced the largest flood in history, but due to the Duliu River diversion project diverting more than half of the flood from the Daqing River and Ziya River to Tianjin, and the Sinvsi River diversion project also played a role at the same time, no major flood occurred.

    The Songhua River and Mudan River have experienced floods many times larger than those in previous years after liberation, but they have all been safely passed. In 1956, the Songhua River water level in Harbin was nearly one meter higher than the highest water level in history, but it was safe and sound; but in 1932, the water was not so high, and Harbin had become a Ze country.

    The Irrigated Area Over Thousands of Years Was 300 Million Mu
    The Irrigated Area Increased by 200 Million Mu in Eight Years
    The disaster of drought in our country is no less than the disaster of floods. In the 268 years of the Qing Dynasty, there were 201 droughts in the Yellow River basin. From 1876 to 1879, the drought in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces killed more than 13 million people. In 1920, the above four provinces, together with parts of Shaanxi, had a major drought in 317 counties, affecting 20 million people, of whom 500,000 died. In 1929, there was another major drought in the Yellow River basin, affecting 34 million people. Even in the Yangtze River basin and Jiangnan area, which have abundant rainfall, droughts are inevitable.

    By the time of liberation, the original irrigated area in our country had only accumulated 300 million mu over thousands of years. The vast majority of the land could only rely on the sky for food. After liberation, agricultural water conservancy construction, like river management, has also achieved great development. In addition to consolidating and restoring the old irrigation projects to give full play to their irrigation benefits, many large-scale irrigation projects have also been built. In the past eight years, the state has invested in more than 300 large-scale irrigation projects. Among them, the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Project is the first project in our country to use Yellow River water to benefit the lower reaches of the Yellow River. At present, the irrigated area has reached 940,000 mu. In the Huai River basin, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal was built. When the entire canal network is completed, the irrigated area can reach more than 20 million mu. The Baisha Irrigation Canal, the first large-scale reservoir irrigation project in our country, has been able to irrigate 230,000 mu of farmland. The "August 1st" Victory Canal in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Beichuan Canal and Dongyuan Canal in Qinghai Province, and the Luohui Canal in Shaanxi Province are all large-scale irrigation projects newly built after liberation.

    In the past eight years, more than 1,000 irrigation areas with more than 10,000 mu have been built, 200 million mu of soil erosion has been controlled, about 140 rural small hydropower stations have been built, more than 10 million ponds, dams, and small reservoirs have been built, 7.5 million wells have been drilled, about 1.8 million waterwheels have been installed, and 430,000 horsepower of pumps have been added. Due to the large-scale construction of large-scale irrigation projects invested by the state and other different forms of farmland water conservancy projects, the total irrigated area developed in eight years has reached more than 200 million mu.

    Who Is the Real Friend of the Chinese People
    Strangely, during the Kuomintang rule, almost no decent water conservancy projects were built, but many so-called "water conservancy experts" were recruited from abroad. Well-known ones include Freeman from the United States, and Engels and Fang Xius from Germany. These people were not so much here to help with water management as they were merchants selling American pine, 洋灰, and闸门, or even spies who secretly photographed terrain and maps of military bases everywhere. German expert Engels just took a turn over the Yellow River in a plane, took some pictures, and went back and wrote a so-called "Yellow River Management Plan." "American water conservancy expert" Freeman and German expert Fang Xius rushed to help the Kuomintang formulate a "Huai River Diversion Plan" and boasted that they would build the "Sanhe Movable Dam" (ie the current Sanhe Sluice Gate). According to their experience, this dam would have to drive at least 10,000 piles, and the wood must be American pine, and the sluice gate must also be American goods.

    After the people's water conservancy construction began, the government invited Soviet experts. They climbed mountains and waded through waters with Chinese water conservancy workers, working hard. Soviet experts not only assisted us in design, but also unreservedly taught us all their advanced experience during construction. For example, when building the Sanhe Sluice Gate, we broke the Chinese convention and adopted the soil load method instead of driving foundation piles when building the gate. This not only saved our country 16% of the gate construction cost, but also completed the construction of this large gate in less than ten months.

    When assisting us in the Yellow River planning, Soviet experts personally surveyed more than 3,000 kilometers of the Yellow River from Liujiaxia to Haikou. Whenever they encountered high mountains and deep waters, they were not afraid of dangers to inquire. Soviet experts also went deep into the Sanmenxia construction site to help solve many problems that needed them to solve.

                    *
    From the comparison of a large number of facts, we can see how different the two worlds are under different social systems in the new and old China: the reactionary rule of old China brought disaster and death to the people, while the new China led by the Communist Party brought construction, stable life, and happiness to the people. Anyone who insists on negating our country's construction achievements and insists on restoring the reactionary rule that has been abandoned by the people in China will surely be crushed by the wheels of history!

    历史是这样记载的
    ——从水利建设的成就看社会主义的优越——
    先流  正章  中西  洪崖
    八年来的水利建设，对我们伟大的未来而言，仅仅是个开端。然而在这个短短的八年中所获得的成就，却已赛过了历史上的几千年。
    然而，一些右派分子却喊叫什么“社会主义不如资本主义”、“新中国不如旧中国”、“治水带来了灾害”等等。水利建设者，特别是从事水利建设多年的工人、农民，对这样的诬蔑是不能答应的。淮河、黄河、长江、海河、辽河流域以及广大农村的身受治水好处的人民群众，也是不能答应的。
    在历史的陈迹上写下了新的篇章
    我们祖先在几千年水旱斗争中曾经为我们留下来许多宝贵的水利工程和宝贵的治水经验。但是在国民党统治时代，许多古老的水利工程备遭破坏，灌溉、航运等工程也逐渐失效，有的还被官僚地主霸占，造成水利纠纷。即以都江堰而言，这样一个规划合理、设计科学、效益显著、闻名中外的古老工程，也由于国民党政府的管理不善，渠道淤塞而效益大减：灌溉面积由原来的三百万亩缩小到一百九十万亩，而且大部为地主豪绅把持，盘剥用水农民，还有十余万亩田经常遭受水灾，把本来完整的渠系，弄得支离破碎。
    1949年，刚一解放，人民政府就拨出三百万斤大米为经费，全面地整修了都江堰渠道，在蒲阳、走马两大干渠上兴修了两座新式水闸，新开了官渠堰、三合堰等三个灌区，扩建了通济堰，使灌溉面积扩大五百六十万亩，使成都平原仍保有“天府之国”之誉。
    历史上沟通南北交通的大运河，由于通航设备残破，堤防损缺，洪水年河水往往溢堤成灾，国民党反动派只修了刘老涧、淮阴等船闸，利用它来收船费。当运河回到人民手里以后，我们只用了几年的时间，不但修复了这些已经残破不堪的船闸，还新建了淮安、仙女庙、邵伯等船闸。还使二千公里长的运河，有一半以上里程恢复通航。人民政府并大力整修两岸损害严重的堤防，保证运河的山东和苏北里下河地段，在汛期不成灾。
    说到解放后水利基本建设方面的成就，那就更大得多了。国家在国民经济恢复时期，就以巨额投资，对淮河、海河、辽河以及长江、黄河进行了治理。而且在解决河流的洪水问题上，采用了带有根本性的治理方法。为着使自己永远摆脱水灾，几万到几百万有组织的农民，以忘我劳动精神战斗在千里淮河工地上。几十万工人、学生也都自愿来到偏僻的乡村、山谷里，从事艰苦的水利建设工作。许多城市工厂，也都为及时供应水利建设器材而夜以继日地忙碌着。这一切难道不是很清楚地说明了人民民主制度是水利建设力量的泉源吗？
      不堪回首话往昔
    在旧中国封建王朝统治的年代，也曾修建过一些工程。如明清两代为把江南征集的粮食运往北京，供皇室享受，曾把淮河的洪泽湖大堤特地用块石增高培厚，以抬高航道水位。明代曾治理过黄河，目的是为了保护皇族在淮黄之间的凤阳皇陵和运河的运粮航道。清代曾在永定河北岸筑上石堤，而在南岸却只修了土堤，因为北岸保护的是帝王的京城，南岸住的是老百姓。
    在国民党统治时期，不但河流的治理未得到反动政府的重视，就是许多热心于黄河治理的水利专家主动提出的不少治理方案，也都被置之不理。“导淮委员会”的大员们却借了“导淮”名义大发水利公债，敲诈了二千多万银元。他们请来了美国专家，但只在运河上修了五座没起作用反而把水归入农田的“归海坝”，每当开坝放水时，就使苏北里下河以东十余县的农田变成海底。除此以外，国民党也曾在几段淮堤上加过一点新土，但就连这一点也是导淮大员和工头们的发财时机，听听当时的民工们的控诉吧：“导淮大员把人伤，区长盖大楼，乡长砌瓦房，‘小伕子’饿断肠！”
    确实是这样，国民党在水利上真是坏事做尽。1938年，当日本鬼子打来的时候，国民党竟炸开黄河花园口大堤，让混浊的黄水泛滥淮河流域豫皖苏三省，淹地八千一百万亩，死亡人口九十八万，使淮河流域从此变成“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，不雨旱灾”的重灾区。
    中国水利史上从来没有的事
    解放后八年来，在淮河上建成了白沙、板桥、石漫滩、薄山、南湾、佛子岭、梅山等七座大水库，还有今年汛期中已能拦洪的响洪甸、磨子潭水库正在施工。永定河上建成了官厅水库，辽河支流浑河上的大伙房水库今年也开始拦洪，黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程已开始施工。这十二座已建成和正在施工的大型水库共能拦蓄一千多亿公方的洪水。这些水库都是蓄纳洪水的一个有控制的人工湖。
    水库，在旧中国的水利史上是从未有过的。拿官厅水库来说，从北洋军阀到国民党，还有日本帝国，都一直空谈修建官厅水库，可是直到解放，连修坝址的岩芯都还没有取出来。然而人民政府只用两年的时间，就把能蓄水二十二亿七千万公方的官厅水库建成了。
    八年来还在淮河、长江、汉水以及海河上，兴建了三河闸、涧河集分水闸、荆江分洪工程的进洪闸和节制闸以及杜家台分洪闸，独流减河进洪闸等十一座大型水闸，六十五座中型水闸。这些水闸都是为控制平原湖区蓄水、分洪以及排水而兴建的。荆江分洪在长江发生洪水的时候，可以分泄六十亿公方的洪水进分洪区，确保荆江大堤和堤外八百万亩农田三百万人民的安全。汉江下游杜家台分洪区可把汉江洪水分泄二十二亿公方入分洪区，保证十五县以上地区的农业生产的安全，改变“沙湖沔阳洲，十年九不收”的局面。
    在旧中国建造这样新式的水闸，也是没有的。至今我们还记得起国民党建三河活动坝的故事。当时国民党反动派以建三河活动坝为名，向美国借债，招兵买马，成立了庞大机构，大吹大擂在三河口建活动坝，可是好几年中只打了几根桩，这是何等荒唐的大骗局啊！
    在人民政府领导下，长达六百七十多公尺，全部为钢筋混凝土结构的三河闸，不到十个月的时间就全部建成了。它不但在淮河汛期可以每秒分泄七千八百秒公方的水入长江，而且在汛后可以拦淮水于洪泽湖，以便苏北灌溉总渠通过渠首高良涧进水闸，引水灌溉二千多万亩农田。
      为了使江淮河汉驯服
    我们还着力于河道和堤防的整理工程。八年来，全国已完成土方八十五亿公方、石方一亿多公方、混凝土二百五十五万公方。如果把这些土石方、混凝土方按一立方的体积连接起来，差不多等于地球赤道的二百一十六倍长。
    八年来淮河培修堤防总长已达三千公里，整理河道与开挖沟洫二百九十八条，总长六千三百公里，同时还修一百六十座涵洞和水闸以及一些水库和十多处的湖泊洼地工程，这就可以防御淮河的五十年一遇的洪水，根本改变了“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾”和“五年小灾，十年大灾，百年特灾”的命运。
    在过去的三千年中，黄河几乎每两年就要发生一次大水灾。自1946年解放时起，我们就在黄河下游整修了黄、沁河两岸一千八百二十二公里的大堤，把四千八百多道不巩固的草埽，改为石埽。共做土方一万五千余万方，使黄河防御超过有水文纪录以来1931年那样大的洪水，同时还在东平湖、北金堤建立了滞洪工程、花园口淤灌及打渔张引黄灌溉济卫等灌溉、航运工程。由于这些工程的作用，黄河在这十年间没有发生一次水灾。
    在长江流域，自1951年起除兴建三处、蓄水共达一百三十多亿公方的蓄洪分洪工程外，并全面地整修堤防和护岸等土方工程，几年来共建成涵闸九百五十多座，这样就使长江的一些重要堤段都提高到1954年以上的洪水位的高度，一般堤段都已超过1931年的洪水位。
    在海河水系，在解放后除做了官厅水库和唐山附近的徒河水库蓄洪工程以外，并大力地进行河道堵口复堤、永定新泛区整理、金钟河疏浚、潮白河河道整理工程。为了减轻大清河、子牙河洪水汇合后对天津市和津浦铁路的威胁，还新开了一条四十公里长的独流减河，南运河四女寺减河的扩大等工程。海河其它河流堤防也都大部用三合土、砖、石加以巩固，使抗洪能力大大提高。
    东北地区的各河堤防也都分别进行了岁修工程。
    国民党政府在河道和堤防的整理上做了些什么呢？国民党曾经在废黄河开挖过一条极狭窄的，每秒只能通过五十公方水的河道，然而这条对排泄淮河洪水不大的河道，很快就被泥沙淤塞了。
    在过去的年代里，国民党政府不但没有修什么工程，就连兴修水利必须的水文、地形等有用的治水资料都未留下，新中国的水利建设，一切都得从头做起。八年来，国家组织了庞大的查勘、测量队伍，平面查勘了一万零二百平方公里，沿线查勘了一万公里，地形测量五十六万公里，水准测量十九万公里，三角测量五十七万点，建立水文测站六千六百四十处。这些成绩都是无数勘测队员用心血换来的。
  洪水考验了两种不同的社会制度
    洪水是无情的，它严酷地考验了两个不同的社会制度。
    历史是这样记载的：从公元前206年到1936年的两千多年间，中国就发生了较大的洪水一千零三十一次。1931年长江发生特大洪水，不但到处堤防决口，就连武汉市和国民党政府所在地南京也浸在水里四个月之久，农田被淹了一亿二千一百五十万亩。解放后的1954年长江所发生的洪水，比1931年大得多，武汉关水位就超过1931年水位一公尺多，但由于荆江分洪工程四次开闸分洪，和党政军民组成的三十万防汛大军的奋勇坚守，全线长江和沿岸各大城市都安全无事。在1931年的淮河洪水期间，惊涛骇浪闯入蚌埠，冲垮津浦铁路，直泻苏北，突破运河堤防，横扫里下河地区，使七亿一千五百四十万亩农田沉入水底，一千八百四十二万人受灾。1954年淮河洪水也比1931年大得多，可是淮河干堤全线都没有决口，蚌埠市、津浦路平安如常。
    1917年和1939年永定河、大清河的洪水，都曾浸入天津市，京津铁路交通断绝。1953年永定河又发生了比这更大的洪水，由于兴建中的官厅水库拦蓄了洪水，因此保障了天津市、京津铁路和永定河下游的安全。1956年整个海河水系发生历史上最大的洪水，但由于独流减河工程分泄了大清河、子牙河流向天津一半以上的洪水，四女寺减河也同时发挥作用，因而也未发生大水灾。
    松花江、牡丹江在解放后曾多次发生比解放前历年都大的洪水，但也都平安度过。1956年哈尔滨市松花江水位，就比历史上最高水位高出近一公尺，但安然无恙；可是1932年水还没有这样大，哈尔滨市已成泽国。
    几千年间灌溉面积有了三亿亩
    八年间灌溉面积增加了两亿亩
    我国干旱的灾难，并不亚于洪水灾害。在清朝统治的二百六十八年中，黄河流域发生旱灾二百零一次。1876年到1879年间，山西、河北、山东、河南四省旱灾，死亡人口就达一千三百多万。1920年，上述四省连同陕西部分地区，共有三百一十七县发生大旱，灾民二千万人，其中死亡的有五十万人。1929年黄河流域又有大旱，灾民达三千四百万人。即是在雨量充沛的长江流域和江南地区，也免不了闹旱灾。
    到解放时为止，我国原有的灌溉面积，几千年积累计仅有三亿亩。绝大多数的土地，还只能是靠天吃饭。解放后，农田水利建设和江河治理一样，也获得了巨大发展。除整顿和恢复了旧有的灌溉工程，使其充分发挥灌溉效益外；还兴修了不少大型灌溉工程。八年来，由国家投资兴办的大型灌溉工程三百余处。其中如引黄灌溉济卫工程，是我国在黄河下游引用黄河水兴利的第一个工程，目前灌溉面积已达九十四万亩。在淮河流域，兴建了苏北灌溉总渠，全部渠系网建成，灌溉面积可以达到二千多万亩。我国第一个引用大型水库蓄水灌溉的白沙灌溉渠，已经能够灌溉二十三万亩农田。新疆维吾尔自治区的“八一”胜利渠、青海省的北川渠、东原渠、陕西省的洛惠渠等，都是解放后新修的大型灌溉工程。
    八年来共兴修万亩以上灌区一千多处，控制水土流失面积二亿亩，兴建农村小型水力发电站约一百四十处，塘、坝、小型水库一千多万处，打井七百五十万眼，安装水车约一百八十万部，增加抽水机四十三万匹马力。由于国家投资的大型灌溉工程和其它不同形式的农田水利工程的大量兴建，八年间总计发展的灌溉面积已达两亿多亩。
    谁是中国人民真正的朋友
    说来奇怪，在国民党统治时期，几乎就没有兴修像样的水利工程，但是却从国外招来了不少的所谓“水利专家”，知名的有美国的费礼门、德国的恩格斯和方修斯等。这些人与其说是来帮助治水的，毋宁说是来推销美国洋松、洋灰和闸门的商贩，甚至于是到处偷摄地形和军事要地地图的间谍。德国专家恩格斯，只是乘着飞机在黄河上空转了一转，摄了一些图片，回去就写了一个所谓“治黄规划”。“美国水利专家”费礼门，德国专家方修斯都争先恐后地帮助国民党制订过“导淮计划”，并吹嘘着要建“三河活动坝”（即现在的三河闸），如果按照他们的经验，这座坝至少要打一万根桩，而且木料一定要用美国的洋松，闸门也要用美国货。
    人民的水利建设开始以后，政府请来了苏联专家。他们和中国的水利工作者一起爬山涉水，辛勤工作。苏联专家不仅协助我们进行设计，而且在施工时也把所有先进经验毫无保留地传授给我们。例如在修建三河闸时打破中国的常规，建闸时不打基桩而采用土壤荷重法，这样不但为我国节省了16％的建闸经费，而且只用不到十个月的时间就建成了这座大闸。
    苏联专家在协助我们进行黄河规划的时候，亲身从黄河刘家峡到海口踏勘了黄河三千多公里，每遇高山深水，他们都不畏艰险地去探询。苏联专家还深入到三门峡工地，帮助解决许多需要他们解决的问题。

    从大量事实的对比中，可以看出在新旧中国不同的社会制度下，是怎样不同的两个世界：旧中国的反动统治给人民带来的是灾难和死亡，共产党领导的新中国给人民带来的则是建设、生活稳定和幸福。谁如果硬要否定我国的建设成就，硬要使已为人民唾弃的反动统治在中国复辟，谁就一定要被历史车轮轧个粉碎！
