    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 6th. The Chinese student men's basketball team played a semi-final match against the Hungarian student team on September 5th. The Chinese team lost to the Hungarian team with a score of 42 to 83.
    The reason for the Chinese team's defeat was the players' poor physical strength. Before the match against the Hungarian team, they had played several very intense matches against student teams from Brazil, Poland, West Germany, and other countries, and had achieved excellent results. However, they did not quickly recover their physical strength from these arduous battles.

    我学生男子篮球队败于匈牙利队
    据新华社巴黎6日电　中国学生男子篮球队，9月5日和匈牙利学生队举行了半决赛。中国队以四十二比八十三败于匈牙利队。
    中国队这次失败的原因是队员们的体力较差。他们在同匈牙利队比赛以前，曾经同巴西、波兰、西德等国家的学生队进行过数场非常激烈的比赛，并且取得了卓越的成绩。但是他们没有从这些艰苦的战斗中迅速恢复体力。
