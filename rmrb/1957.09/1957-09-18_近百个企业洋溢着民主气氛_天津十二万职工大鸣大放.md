    Nearly a Hundred Enterprises Radiate a Democratic Atmosphere
    120,000 Workers in Tianjin Engage in Extensive Airing of Views

    This newspaper Tianjin, 16th report (By Our Reporter Zhong Lin) – In the past week, nearly a hundred state-owned industrial and transportation enterprises in Tianjin have successively and comprehensively begun rectification, with more than 120,000 workers successively joining the upsurge of “extensive airing of views.”
    In many enterprises, after the leadership held mobilization meetings, workers formed groups to hold discussions, writing and posting big-character posters as they talked. To facilitate the “extensive airing of views” for the workers, all units prepared paper, pens, and ink, and also established big-character poster writing areas, “airing views corners,” “airing views reception stations,” and “airing views suggestion boxes.” Various symposiums were also held to solicit opinions widely. The state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, with more than 7,000 workers, within 12 hours after the mobilization meeting, workers posted more than 2,000 big-character posters in seven "airing views corners" on the more than 500-meter-long poster shed that was temporarily built. By the statistics of the next day, the number of big-character posters had increased to more than 4,300. Group meetings, symposiums, and big-character posters put forward more than 9,700 opinions in two days. Among these opinions, the most were related to the work style of leading cadres and enterprise production management, followed by those related to wages, bonuses, and living benefits, and others were opinions related to party-masses relations and the country's political life.

    The leadership of each unit has concentrated considerable strength to be specifically responsible for collecting, sorting out, and studying the opinions put forward by the workers in the "extensive airing of views," and handling them in accordance with the spirit of "rectifying while correcting." The state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill transferred 15 engineers and section chiefs to, under the leadership of relevant factory directors and deputy factory directors, review and study the more than 5,700 opinions put forward by the workers in five days, group by group. As of the 13th, they had studied 2,744 opinions and initially decided that 305 items could be answered immediately and adopted. They are preparing to hold a workers' congress in the coming days to answer these opinions by category and mobilize workers to continue to "air" deeply, thoroughly, and exhaustively. A factory under the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry had a large crane that had been idle for a long time. The workers questioned on big-character posters, "Why let the big crane sleep?" The factory immediately requested the higher authorities to transfer the crane for use. The workers suggested that the method of taking bowls with tokens in the canteen was too troublesome, and the canteen immediately decided to take bowls without tokens. The leadership then posted big-character posters and announced these measures on the radio, and the workers were all smiles, and the enthusiasm for "airing" increased even more. Some old workers who were originally worried that the leadership was not determined to correct shortcomings have now increased their confidence and actively put forward criticisms and suggestions for improving work.

    At the beginning of the rectification, each unit put forward the call to ensure that rectification and production are not delayed, and the workers put forward guarantees and responded to this call with practical actions. While posting big-character posters with criticisms and suggestions, the workers in many units also posted their production good news. On September 10, the workers of the freight repair workshop of the Tianjin Railway Vehicle Depot not only actively participated in the "extensive airing of views," but also repaired 11 vehicles (one more than planned). On the first day of the "extensive airing of views," the output of pulp and paper at the Tianjin Paper Mill exceeded the day's plan by 6%. The attendance rate of workers in many enterprises has increased compared to usual. The workers of the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory not only had higher attendance rates for production and meetings than usual, but also had better production order and labor discipline than usual.

    Under the repeated education of the Party organization, leading cadres and general cadres at all levels in each unit were able to calm down and listen to the opinions of the masses. However, individual leaders in some units experienced the phenomenon of being unable to calm down and being eager to defend themselves. In some units, some medical staff, fearing criticism from big-character posters, did not adhere to the system and relaxed the conditions for granting leave and giving whatever medicine was requested; individual inspectors also relaxed product inspection standards, affecting product quality. These deviations were quickly corrected after being discovered by the leadership.

    According to the materials checked out by some units that started the "extensive airing of views" earlier, there are still many workers, especially some staff and engineering and technical personnel, who have various ideological concerns and are unwilling to "air" their true opinions. These units are strengthening the work of rectifying while correcting, and continuing to widely and deeply mobilize the masses of workers to "air views extensively."

### 近百个企业洋溢着民主气氛  天津十二万职工大鸣大放

　　近百个企业洋溢着民主气氛
　　天津十二万职工大鸣大放
    本报天津16日电　本报记者钟林报道：近一周来，天津国营工业和交通运输企业已有近百个单位先后全面开始整风，十二万多名职工陆续卷入了“大鸣大放”的热潮。
    许多企业的职工们，在领导方面召开了动员大会以后，即分组座谈、边谈边写、边贴大字报。各单位为了便利职工们“大鸣大放”，都准备了纸张和笔墨，还设立了大字报书写处、“鸣放园地”、“鸣放接待站”和“鸣放意见箱”；并召开各种座谈会广泛征求意见。有着七千多名职工的国营天津第一棉纺织厂，在开了动员会后的十二个钟头以内，职工们即在临时赶搭起来的五百多公尺长的报棚上，分七个“鸣放园地”贴出了两千多张大字报；到第二天的统计，大字报已增至四千三百多张；两天的小组会、座谈会和大字报共提出了九千七百多条意见。这些意见中，以有关领导干部的工作作风和企业生产管理方面的为最多，有关工资、奖励和生活福利方面的次之，其他为有关党群关系和国家的政治生活方面的意见。
    各单位的领导方面，都集中了相当大的力量，专门负责汇集整理和研究职工们在“大鸣大放”当中提出来的意见，并且根据“边整边改”的精神进行处理。国营天津造纸总厂抽调了十五名工程师和科长，在有关的厂长和副厂长领导下，分组逐条审查和研究职工们在五天内所提出来的五千七百多条意见，到13日为止，他们已研究了两千七百四十四条意见，初步决定能够马上答复并予采纳的有三百零五件，他们准备在日内召开的职工大会上分类答复这些意见，并动员职工继续“放”深、“放”透、“放”尽。二机部一个工厂有一台大吊车长期闲置未用，职工们在大字报上质问道：“为什么让大吊车睡大觉？”厂里立即请求上级把大吊车调去使用；职工们提出，食堂里凭牌取碗的办法太麻烦，食堂立即决定取碗不要牌。领导上随即贴出大字报并在广播中宣布了这些措施，职工们喜笑颜开，“鸣”“放”热情更加高涨。有些老工人原来顾虑领导上没决心改正缺点，现在也增加了信心，积极提出了批评和改进工作的意见。
    各单位在整风开始就提出要使整风生产两不误的号召，职工们纷纷提出保证并用实际行动响应了这个号召。许多单位的职工在贴出批评建议的大字报的同时，还贴出了他们的生产捷报。9月10日，天津铁路车辆段货修车间的职工们不仅积极参加“大鸣大放”，而且还修好了十一辆车（比计划多一辆）。天津造纸总厂在开始“大鸣大放”的第一天，纸浆和纸张的产量超额6％完成了当天的计划。许多企业的职工的出勤率都比平常有所提高。国营天津第一棉纺织厂的职工，不仅生产和开会的出勤率都比平常高，而且生产秩序和劳动纪律也比平常好。
    在党组织的反复教育下，各单位的各级领导干部和一般干部，都能沉住气去倾听群众的意见。但有的单位的个别领导人员，却发生了沉不住气急于辩解的现象；有的单位发生了个别医务人员怕大字报的批评，就不坚持制度而放宽了准假条件和要什么药就给什么药　现象；个别检验人员也有放宽产品检验尺度而影响了产品质量的现象。这些偏向，经过领导方面发现后即迅速加以纠正了。
    据开始“大鸣大放”较早的一些单位所检查出来的材料说明，还有不少职工特别是部分职员和工程技术人员，思想上还存在着种种顾虑，不肯把自己的真实意见“鸣”“放”出来。这些单位正在加强边整边改的工作，并继续广泛深入地动员职工群众“大鸣大放”。
