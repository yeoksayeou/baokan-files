Radhakrishnan's Speech

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee:

I am honored to be invited to meet with the representatives of the great Chinese people and to have the opportunity to say a few words to them. As your Chairman just said, I am not unfamiliar with parliamentary work myself, as I also serve as Chairman of the Upper House of India, the Council of States, according to our Constitution. Indeed, our two countries have only recently gained freedom and have set the same goals for ourselves. You are working to build socialism. We have also declared that a socialist-style society is our goal. Therefore, as free countries, our two countries agree on many things. We are both working in accordance with democratic forms. The word democracy is derived from Greek, and it means the power of the people. In other words, every democratic constitution requires us to respect the wishes of the people. In these few minutes, I intend to explain what democracy is as a belief or an ideal, what democracy is as a political arrangement, as a social and economic technique, and as an international attitude and perspective. I want to explain these four aspects of democracy in as much detail as possible within the short time I have available.

Karl Marx criticized industrial capitalism because it turned workers into corks in the social machine. They lose dignity, self-respect, and independence. The entire capitalist mode of industrial system dehumanizes workers. This is Karl Marx's criticism of the capitalist system. Therefore, he advocated the construction of a socialist society so that individuals not only have the opportunity to obtain food, clothing, and housing, but also have the opportunity to grow their minds. At the same time, if we empty the mind and stifle the spirit, the spirit is not enough to nourish the body. Therefore, he advocated that workers must become human beings, become true human beings, become people who can obtain food, clothing, and housing, and have the opportunity to exercise their minds and develop their spirits. Therefore, Karl Marx argued that in a good, true democratic system, all different aspects of humanity must be satisfied. We must recognize that man is not entirely a social being; humanity has another aspect, a separate aspect. It is precisely by working alone that people have created great works in art, architecture, literature, philosophy, religion, science, and other fields. When a person is most focused, he uses all his brainpower, concentrates on the object he is studying, thinks calmly and selflessly, with a calm expression and focused eyes. When he does this, he glimpses truth and beauty, and brings truth and beauty to us to enlighten humanity. Therefore, the greatest work is accomplished by people as human beings, as spiritual entities. Therefore, the ideal of democracy is to respect people. There may or may not be God in heaven, but the only God that certainly exists is the God in people's hearts. It is in this atmosphere of conflicting ideas and freedom of thought that all flowers can bloom and all schools of thought can contend. But man is not only a spiritual existence. Man does not live in the air, nor does he live in a vacuum. Man lives in a society. In that society, we must make a political arrangement for people that can help express their deepest beliefs. In our country, we hold general elections every five years to understand the wishes of the people. In 1952, we had about 160 million voters, of whom 105 million participated in the vote. In 1957, we had about 170 million voters, and nearly 115 million people participated in the vote. We believe that the government of every country should try to understand the wishes of the people. In the words of Buddha, we should seek the benefit of the masses and seek the happiness of the masses. Buddha also said that the voice of the people must be the guiding principle of every government.

No government can ignore the wishes of the people, and there must be an opportunity to understand the wishes of the people. In our democratic system, we have created a system of regular elections to understand the wishes of the people. Because we know that we cannot force people to do things against their will. When the great American people were forced to implement prohibition, it was never able to be enforced, because the will of the people did not support it. Their entire army, their entire police force, their entire system of imprisonment and prosecution, etc., all of this failed to make prohibition successful. Why? Because the American people were against prohibition. Therefore, if the government wants to do something that does not conform to the wishes of the people or contradicts the wishes of the people, it cannot succeed. Therefore, in our country, we find out what the people need every five years, because if we push them too far, they will turn against us, and they will oppose us barehanded and swear to die, with a desperate courage born entirely of despair.

Political arrangements or measures to improve the economic structure of society are not ends in themselves. They can be said to be means, means to make the lives of ordinary people richer, happier, and better. Political measures have instrumental value. But they do not have any substantial value. The substantial value is to improve the lives of ordinary people. The honors that were enjoyed by a few in the past should now be enjoyed by all ordinary people—regardless of gender, wealth, or poverty. In other words, economic improvement is the goal of the political machine. You are working for this, and we are also working for this. There is still a lot of work to be done, but the little bit of work we have already done has shown the direction of our actions. Those who were able to visit the Indian exhibition inaugurated by Vice Chairman Zhu De this morning will have some understanding of the work in the economic construction of our society. So I say that democracy is a technique for raising the level of ordinary people, and this is precisely the economic driving force of the democratic system.

In the process of economic construction, we can learn from each other. We are moving towards the same goal, on the one hand adopting modern technology, and on the other hand ensuring that unemployment does not increase while continuing to implement mechanization. We face the same problems, so your experience and our experience can be integrated, and we can benefit greatly from learning from each other.

Internationally, we have ended an era, an era in which countries lived in their own narrow circles. Now we have stepped into a wider world. The development of nuclear power has made the military path an outdated path. Therefore, there is now an organization like the United Nations. But unfortunately, for several reasons, that organization has not been able to function normally. The most important reason is that this organization does not have universality; in other words, not all the people of all countries in the world have representatives to participate in this organization. We hope, we fervently hope, that the great Chinese people will be admitted to the United Nations as a member state. Without China's suggestions and guidance, we cannot solve the problems related to Asia. It was precisely because China was not a member state of the United Nations that the Indochina Conference had to be held outside the scope of the United Nations, thereby weakening the power, prestige, and influence of the United Nations. Therefore, if the United Nations organization is to play a proper role, then it is very necessary to let the people of China, this great Asian country, participate in this organization as soon as possible.

The second major shortcoming of this organization is that it is divided into blocs of great powers. Almost all issues are not decided based on the merits of the issues themselves, but based on the influence of the balance of power. Whether in Southeast Asia, or in West Asia, or in Central Europe, or anywhere else, issues are not discussed based on the merits and reasons of the issues, but based on the relationship between these issues and the balance of power between the two major blocs.

Another shortcoming of the United Nations organization is that it does not have an agency to achieve peaceful change. Those countries that protect vested interests are superstitious that the current order is sacred. All those who want to get rid of oppression and colonial rule have no choice but to resort to war. If there is to be an agency that achieves change in a way that is beneficial to oppressed peoples and anti-colonialism, then we must come up with a way to allow dependent countries such as Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria to decide their own future without being hindered by other countries. Therefore, I believe that the three serious shortcomings of the United Nations are: the United Nations does not have universality, it is harmed by national blocs, and it does not have an agency to achieve peaceful change.

Therefore, my friends, you will see that in foreign relations, our ideals are almost the same; that is: world peace, the liberation of all oppressed peoples, and peaceful coexistence with countries that have different ideologies in politics and economy. Man is born to love, not to hate; man is born to create, not to destroy. Your great sages once said: All men are brothers within the four seas. The whole world has gathered together and become a single whole. It is precisely in this spirit that we try to discover psychological harmony and spiritual unity, so that everyone can regard his neighbor as a brother. This is very necessary, and in this regard, the great Chinese civilization can make a very fundamental and valuable contribution to the formation of the new world—the great Chinese civilization has always been deeply pacifist for generations, it regards its neighbors as friends, and it does not believe in military methods. Whether in domestic or international affairs, we have a basic point of agreement, that is, to carry out socialist construction at home and practice peaceful coexistence abroad. If we cooperate according to these principles, coupled with the wisdom accumulated by China and India for generations, no force in the world can harm us.

On behalf of my government and the people of India, I wish the Chinese people unprecedented prosperity and progress.

Liu Shaoqi's Welcome Speech

Respected Vice President Radhakrishnan:

Comrades, friends:

Today, we, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, are holding an enlarged meeting to welcome Dr. Radhakrishnan, Vice President of the Republic of India and Chairman of the Council of States, who is visiting our country. We feel very honored. First of all, let us extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guest.

We all know that Vice President Radhakrishnan is an outstanding Indian politician and scholar. He has played an important role in India's national independence struggle, cultural and educational undertakings, and his current work as a national leader, and therefore enjoys extremely high prestige in India. Moreover, his activities and influence extend far beyond the scope of his own country. As a scholar, he has a deep understanding of ancient philosophy in India and other Eastern countries. He has been invited to lecture in various countries and has written many internationally renowned works. As an international political activist, he has always actively advocated peaceful coexistence between countries, easing international tensions, strengthening economic and cultural exchanges, and especially emphasized unity and cooperation between Asian and African countries, opposing racial discrimination and colonialism, and opposing war and military blocs. These valuable efforts of his have been widely praised by the public in various countries. What should be especially mentioned here is Vice President Radhakrishnan's connection with China. He has always had a good impression of China and is very interested in studying China's traditional culture and ancient philosophy. He has a firm belief in China's future. In his book "India and China" in 1944, he said: Although China is suffering, China will surely become a modern country in the future and cooperate with other countries on an equal footing. After India and China got rid of the shackles of colonialism and gained independence, he, as one of the leaders of the Republic of India, played an active role in promoting the cause of Sino-Indian friendship and cooperation, and has repeatedly and solemnly advocated restoring the legitimate status of New China in the United Nations. The Chinese people admire his efforts very much.

India is a large, peace-loving country. In recent years, it has made very important contributions to strengthening the unity of Asian and African countries, safeguarding world peace, and promoting international friendship, and has won the praise of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. Like China, India has an ancient and brilliant culture and a hardworking and brave people. The people of the two countries have a deep traditional friendship. In recent years, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—Panchsheel—jointly advocated by China and India, our friendly relations have gained new development. We should further strengthen the friendly relations and cooperation between China and India in all aspects in the future, because this not only conforms to the interests of our two countries, but also contributes to the peace of Asia and Africa and the world.

### 在人大常委会扩大会议上

　　在人大常委会扩大会议上
　　拉达克里希南的演讲
　　委员长先生和常务委员会委员们：
    我应邀同伟大的中国人民的代表们见面，能够有机会向他们说几分钟话，感到非常荣幸。正如你们的委员长刚才所说的，我自己不是不熟悉议会工作的，因为根据我们的宪法，我还担任印度上院即联邦院议长。的确，我们两国是最近才获得自由的，并且为我们自己规定了相同的目标。你们正在为建设社会主义而努力。我们也已经宣布，社会主义式样的社会是我们努力的目标。因此，作为自由的国家，我们两国在很多方面是意见一致的。我们都是在按照民主的形式进行工作。民主这个字眼是从希腊文转化而来的，它的意思是人民的权力。换句话说，每一个民主的宪法都要求我们尊重人民的愿望。我打算在这几分钟内说明作为一种信念或者一种理想的民主是甚么，作为一种政治安排的民主、作为一种社会和经济的技术的民主、作为一种国际态度和观点的民主是甚么。我想在我能利用的短短的时间内尽可能详细说明民主的这四个方面。
    卡尔·马克思对工业资本主义提出批评，因为它使工人变成社会机器中的软木塞了。他们失去尊严、自尊和独立。整个资本主义方式的工业制度使工人失去了人性。这就是卡尔·马克思对资本主义制度的批评。因此，他主张建设社会主义社会，使个人不仅有机会获得食物、衣著和住屋，还有机会使心灵成长，同时如果我们使心灵空虚、精神窒息的话，精神是不足以养育肉体的。因此，他主张必须使工人成为人，成为名副其实的人，成为能够获得食物、衣服和住屋，并且有机会锻炼自己的心灵和发展自己的精神的人。因此，卡尔·马克思主张，在一个良好的、真正的民主制度中，必须能够满足人性的各个不同的方面。我们必须认识人并不完全是一种社会的存在，人性还有另外一个方面，一个单独的方面。人正是由于单独地工作，才在艺术、建筑、文学、哲学、宗教、科学等方面创造了伟大的作品。人在精神最集中的时候运用全部脑力，专心致志于他所研究的对象，镇静、忘我地思考，神色沉着，眼光专注。当他这样做的时候，他就瞥见真和美，而把真和美带给我们来启迪人性。因此，最伟大的工作是人们作为人、作为精神实体完成的。因此，民主的理想就是尊重人。天上或许有上帝，或许没有，但是可以肯定存在着的唯一的上帝就是人们心中的上帝。就是在这种观念冲突和思想自由的气氛中，百花才能齐放，百家才能争鸣。但是，人不仅仅是一种精神的存在。人并不是生活在空中，也不是生活在真空里。人是生活在一个社会里。在那个社会里，我们必须为人们作出一种能够帮助表达人的最深刻的信念的政治安排。在我们的国家里，我们每五年举行一次大选，借以了解人民的愿望。1952年，我们的选民约为一亿六千万，其中参加投票的有一亿零五百万人。在1957年，我们约有一亿七千万选民，参加投票的将近一亿一千五百万人。我们认为每一个国家的政府都应当设法了解人民的愿望。用佛的话来说，应当谋求大众的利益，谋求大众的幸福。佛还说，人民的呼声必须成为每一个政府的指导原则。
    没有一个政府可以忽视人民的愿望，必须有机会来了解人民的愿望。在我国的民主制度中，我们已经创造了定期选举这个制度，来了解人民的愿望。因为我们知道，我们不能强迫人民作出违反他们的意志的事情。当伟大的美国人民被强制实行禁酒的时候，一直没有能贯彻执行，因为人民的意志不支持这样做。他们的全部军队，他们的全部警察，他们的全部徒刑和起诉制度等等，所有这一切都没有能使禁酒成功。为什么呢？因为美国人民是反对禁酒的。因此，如果政府想要作出不符合人民愿望或同人民愿望相矛盾的事情，它是不能成功的。因此，在我们的国家中，我们每隔五年就来了解一下人民需要什么，因为如果我们太让他们过不去，他们就会转而反对我们，他们就会抱着完全由于绝望而产生的不顾一切的勇气赤手空拳地誓死反对我们。
    政治安排或改善社会的经济结构的措施本身并不是目的。它们可以说是手段，使普通人的生活更富裕、更幸福和更美好的手段。政治措施是具有工具性质的价值的。但是它们没有任何实质性的价值。实质性的价值是改善普通人的生活。过去为少数人所享受的荣誉今后应该为一切普通人——不分男女和贫富——所享受。换句话说，经济的改善才是政治机器的目的。你们正在为此而努力，我们也正在为此而努力。要完成的工作还很多，但是我们所已经完成的那一点工作已经表明了我们行动的方向。那些能够在今天早晨参观了由朱德副主席揭幕的印度展览会的人们，将会对我们的社会的经济建设方面的工作有一些了解。所以我说民主是一种提高普通人的水平的技术，这正是民主制度的经济上的动力。
    在经济建设的过程中，我们可以互相学习。我们正在向同一目标前进，一方面采用现代化技术，一方面保证在继续实行机械化的同时，失业不致增加。我们所面临的问题是一样的，因此你们的经验和我们的经验可以溶合在一起，我们可以从互相学习中得到很大好处。
    在国际方面，我们已经结束了一个时代，各国生活在自己狭小的圈子里的时代。现在我们已经跨进更为广阔的天地。原子核动力的发展已经使军事的道路成为陈旧过时的道路了。因此现在有一个联合国组织这样的机构。但是不幸由于几个原因，那个组织并没有能正常地起作用。最重要的原因是这个组织里并不具有普遍性，换句话说，并不是全世界所有国家的人民都有代表参加这个组织。我们希望、我们热烈地希望伟大的中国人民会作为一个会员国而被接纳入联合国。没有中国的建议和指导，我们是不能解决有关亚洲的问题的。正是由于中国不是联合国的会员国，印度支那会议就不得不在联合国范围以外举行，因而削弱了联合国的权力、威信和影响。因此，如果联合国组织要起适当的作用，那么尽快让中国这个伟大的亚洲国家的人民参加这个组织是非常必要的。
    这个组织的第二个大缺点是，它分成了大国集团。几乎所有问题都不是根据问题本身的是非曲直而是根据力量对比的影响决定的。不管是在东南亚，还是在西亚，还是在中欧，不管是在什么地方，讨论问题的时候都不是根据问题的是非曲直和道理，而是根据这些问题同两大集团之间的力量对比的关系。
    联合国组织的另一个缺点是，没有实现和平的改变的机构。那些在保护既得利益的国家迷信目前的秩序是神圣的。凡是想摆脱压迫和殖民统治的人都只好诉诸战争。如果要有一个在对被压迫民族有利、对反殖民主义有利的情况下实现改变的机构，那就必须想出一种使突尼斯、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚等附属国能够决定自己的未来而不受别国阻碍的办法。因此，我认为，联合国的三个严重的缺点是：联合国不具有普遍性，它受国家集团的损害，它没有实现和平的改变的机构。
    因此，我的朋友们，你们将会看到：在对外关系方面，我们的理想差不多是一致的；这就是：世界和平，一切被压迫的人民得到解放，同在政治和经济方面具有不同的意识形态的国家和平共处。人是为了爱而不是为了恨而降生的，人是为了创造而不是为了破坏而降生的。你们的伟大的圣人曾经说过：四海之内皆兄弟。全世界已经聚合起来，成为一个单一的整体。它正是本着这种精神设法发现心理上的和谐和精神上的一致，以便每个人都可以把他的邻人看作兄弟。这是很必要的，在这方面，伟大的中国文明可以对新世界的形成作出非常基本而有价值的贡献——伟大的中国文明世世代代都是一直带有浓厚的和平主义色彩，它把邻人看做朋友，它不相信军事方法。无论在国内方面还是国际方面，我们都是有基本的一致之点的，那就是在国内进行社会主义建设，在国外实行和平共处。如果我们根据这些原则实行合作，再加上我们有中印两国世世代代积累下的智慧，世界上就没有任何力量可以伤害我们。
    我代表我国政府和印度人民祝中国人民得到空前的繁荣和进步。
　　刘少奇的欢迎词
　　尊敬的拉达克里希南副总统阁下：
　　同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们全国人民代表大会常务委员会召开扩大会议，来欢迎正在我国进行访问的印度共和国副总统兼国会联邦院议长拉达克里希南博士阁下，感到十分荣幸。首先，让我们向尊敬的贵宾表示热烈的欢迎。
    我们都知道，拉达克里希南副总统阁下是印度杰出的政治家和学者。他在印度民族独立斗争、文化教育事业和目前担任的国家领导工作中都起了重要的作用，因此在印度国内享有极高的威望。而且，他的活动和影响远远超出本国的范围。作为学者，他对印度和东方各国的古代哲学有很深的研究，曾经受聘到各国讲学，写了很多国际驰名的著作。作为国际政治活动家，他多年来一向积极主张国际间和平共处，缓和国际紧张局势，加强经济文化交流，并特别强调亚非国家间的团结合作，反对种族歧视和殖民主义，反对战争和军事集团。他这些可贵的努力，受到了各国公众广泛的赞许，这里应该特别提起的是副总统阁下和中国的因缘。他对中国一向具有好感，对研究中国的传统文化和古代哲学很有兴趣。他对中国的前途怀有坚定的信心，他在1944年“印度与中国”一书中曾说过：中国虽然在遭受着苦难，但是中国将来一定会成为一个现代化的国家，站在平等的地位同别的国家合作。在印度和中国摆脱了殖民主义的束缚，获得了独立以后，他作为印度共和国的领导人之一曾经在中印友好合作的事业上起了积极推动作用，并且多次严正地主张恢复新中国在联合国的合法地位。对于他的这些努力，中国人民是很钦佩的。
    印度是一个爱好和平的大国，近年来在加强亚非各国团结、维护世界和平和推进国际友好方面作出了很重要的贡献，获得了中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的赞扬。印度和中国一样，有着古老光辉的文化和勤劳勇敢的人民，两国人民有着深厚的传统友谊。近年来，在中印两国共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则——潘查希拉——的基础上，我们的友好关系又获得了新的发展。我们今后要进一步加强中印两国之间的友好关系以及在各方面的合作，因为这不仅符合于我们两国的利益，而且也有助于亚非两洲和世界的和平。
