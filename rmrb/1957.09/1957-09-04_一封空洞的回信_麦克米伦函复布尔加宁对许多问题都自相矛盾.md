Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd, London dispatch: The British government published on September 2nd a letter from British Prime Minister Macmillan to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin. The content of this letter is extremely hollow; it is a reply to Bulganin's letter of July 20th.

Macmillan, when first discussing the issue of disarmament, specifically used the so-called "package" disarmament proposals recently put forward by Western countries to deflect Bulganin's criticism of Britain's attitude toward disarmament.

Regarding European security and the German question, Macmillan reiterated the claims made in the joint declaration on the German question signed in Berlin on July 29th by Britain, the United States, France, and West Germany. This declaration merely repeated the old tune of the West's so-called annexation of East Germany by West Germany through "free elections."

Regarding the Middle East issue, Macmillan welcomed the Soviet Union's policy of ensuring lasting peace in the Middle East. However, he slandered the recent actions of the Soviet government as "not quite what they seem."

Macmillan expressed support for expanding Anglo-Soviet trade, but refused to relax trade restrictions.

Regarding cultural exchanges, Macmillan said that the British government "has not placed any obstacles" to them. However, he used the so-called "Hungarian event" as an excuse to refuse to implement the plans for large-scale cultural exchanges that the two countries had discussed last year.

    一封空洞的回信
    麦克米伦函复布尔加宁对许多问题都自相矛盾
    据新华社3日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府9月2日发表了英国首相麦克米伦给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的一封信。这封信的内容极其空洞，它是答复布尔加宁7月20日的来信的。
    麦克米伦在首先谈到裁军问题时，特地用西方国家最近提出的所谓“一揽子”裁军建议来搪塞布尔加宁对英国裁军态度的指责。
    关于欧洲安全和德国问题，麦克米伦重申了英国、美国、法国和西德等四国7月29日在柏林签署的关于德国问题的联合宣言的主张。这个宣言不过重弹了西方的所谓通过“自由选举”由西德来并吞东德的老调。
    关于中东问题，麦克米伦对苏联的确保中东的持久和平的方针表示欢迎。但是，他又污蔑苏联政府最近的行动“有点不是那么一回事”。
    麦克米伦表示赞成扩大英苏贸易，但是拒绝放宽贸易限制。
    关于文化交流问题，麦克米伦说英国政府“没有加以任何阻碍”，但是，他又以所谓“匈牙利事件”为借口，拒绝执行去年两国讨论过的开展大规模文化交流的计划。
