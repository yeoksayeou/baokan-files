　　Central Leaders Read Big-Character Posters

　　A few days ago, several leading comrades from the Central Committee came to the factory to look at our big-character posters. This news spread quickly. The central leaders are so busy, dealing with so much work every day, yet they still take the time to come to the factory and listen to the opinions of the workers. It really moves us. They read the big-character posters so carefully, practically reading each word, and some even took out notebooks to write things down. Seeing how much the central leaders value the rectification campaign in the factory, everyone has more confidence and enthusiasm to improve their work and step up production. One comrade said: I saw a central leader standing in front of my big-character poster for a long time. The suggestion I made might not be solved immediately, but knowing that the central leader is aware of it makes me feel happy.

　　中央首长看大字报
    前几天，好几位中央负责同志到厂里来看我们的大字报，这件事马上便传开了。中央首长们那么忙，每天要处理那么多的工作，还抽出时间到工厂里来，听听工人的意见，真叫我们感动。他们看大字报看得那么仔细，简直是一个字一个字地念，有的还掏出小本子记下来。看到中央首长那么重视工厂的整风，大家对改进工作、加紧生产就更有信心、更有劲头了。有一位同志说：我看见中央首长在我贴的那张大字报前面看了好久，我提的那个建议，暂时也许不能解决，但是中央首长知道了，我心里也就痛快了。
