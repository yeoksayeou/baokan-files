Treasure Hunting in the Qilian Mountains

In the Qilian Mountains, which have been sleeping for many centuries, the bugle of dawn has sounded, and hundreds of thousands of prospectors are exploring her treasures.

The Qilian Mountains are located at the junction of Gansu and Qinghai provinces, stretching one thousand kilometers in length and six hundred kilometers in width. "Looking at the Qilian Mountains from horseback, the peaks reach high into the sky" is a line from an ancient poem describing her towering and majestic appearance. In this mountain range, legends of abundant treasures have circulated for half a century, attracting many geological researchers. However, in old China, they never achieved their aspirations. Only after liberation have the footprints of prospectors appeared everywhere here. In just a few years, a large number of geological exploration workers have already found more than twenty kinds of metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits, such as gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, zinc, and coal. Forestry and water conservancy personnel are also investigating forest and water resources here.

    祁连山探宝
    在沉睡了许多世纪的祁连山里，已经响起了黎明的号角，成千上万的勘探人员正在探索她的宝藏。
    祁连山位于甘肃和青海两省交界，长一千公里、宽六百公里。“马上望祁连，连峰高插天”这是古代诗人形容她的高峻风貌的诗句。就在这条山脉里，半个世纪来遍地是宝的传说，曾经吸引过许多地质研究工作者。但是，在旧中国，他们始终未能如愿。只有在解放后，这里才到处出现了勘探者的足迹。短短的几年中，大批的地质勘探工作者，已经找到了金、银、铜、铁、铅锌、煤等二十多种金属和非金属矿藏。林业和水利部门的人员也在这里调查森林和水利资源。
