Xinhua News Agency, 29th – China's self-sufficiency in steel is expected to increase from 61% in 1953 to 88% this year. This is the result of the rapid development of China's steel industry.

	This year, apart from a small amount of steel plates, tinplate, steel pipes, large sections, alloy steel plates, and train wheels that still need to be imported, the ordinary steel and many advanced alloy steels needed by China's national economy can basically be supplied domestically. High-quality steel, which was almost entirely imported from abroad before liberation, can now meet nearly 90% of domestic demand this year.

	The amount of steel consumed by various sectors of China's national economy has been increasing every year in recent years. This year, the national consumption of steel is expected to increase by 1.1 times compared to 1953.

	Before liberation, China's steel self-sufficiency rate was very low. According to old records, before 1936, 95% of the steel needed domestically was imported from abroad, due to the extreme backwardness of the steel industry in old China.

	This year, China's steel industry produces more steel in an average of two months than the highest annual output in old China. The highest annual steel production in old China – in 1943 – was only 680,000 tons. This year, China's planned steel output is more than 4.47 million tons, steel 4.98 million tons, and pig iron more than 5.55 million tons.

	The continuous increase in new steel varieties is an important sign of the rapid improvement of China's steel industry's technical level. By the end of this year, the number of steel grades that China can smelt will increase from more than 180 in 1952 to more than 370, and the variety and specifications of steel products will increase from more than 400 in 1952 to more than 3,000. In terms of steel grades, high heat-resistant alloy steel and high-grade alloy structural steel for the aviation industry, special physical performance steel for the electrical machinery industry, various stainless steels, and many other steel grades that could not be smelted before liberation can now be produced. In terms of steel products, it is now possible to produce a variety of large steel products, alloy seamless steel pipes, shipbuilding steel plates, automotive steel plates, stainless steel plates, silicon steel sheets, and other technically complex products; heat-resistant steel plates and steel wire ropes for the production of aircraft, which could not be manufactured at all before liberation, can now also be produced.

	In order to continue to improve the self-sufficiency rate of steel and better meet the needs of the national economy, relevant departments have taken measures to solve the production problems of certain steel pipes and steel plates that still need to be imported. It is expected that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, China's steel self-sufficiency rate may be further improved.

### 我国钢铁工业发展迅速  许多高级和特殊钢种已能生产

    我国钢铁工业发展迅速
    许多高级和特殊钢种已能生产
    新华社29日讯　中国钢材自给程度今年可望由1953年的61％提高到88％。这是中国钢铁工业迅速发展的结果。
    今年，除少数的钢板、马口铁、钢管、大型型钢和合金钢板、车轮还要进口以外，中国国民经济需要的普通钢材和许多高级合金钢材，基本上都可以由国内供应。解放以前几乎完全从国外进口的优质钢材，今年国内已经能够供应需要量将近90％。
    中国国民经济各部门消费的钢材，最近几年来每年都在增加。今年全国消费的钢材预计比1953年增长了一点一倍。
    解放以前，中国钢材自给率是很低的。据旧资料记载，1936年以前，国内需要的钢材95％是从国外进口的，这是因为旧中国钢铁工业极端落后的缘故。
    今年，中国钢铁工业平均每两个月生产的钢材就比旧中国最高年产量还多。旧中国钢材产量最高的一年——1943年只生产了六十八万吨。今年中国钢材计划产量为四百四十七万多吨，钢四百九十八万多吨，生铁五百五十五万多吨。
    新的钢铁品种不断增加，是中国钢铁工业技术水平飞速提高的重要标志。到今年年底，中国能够冶炼的钢种将从1952年的一百八十多种增加到三百七十多种，钢材的品种规格将从1952年的四百多种增加到三千多种。钢种方面，像航空工业用的高耐热合金钢、高级合金结构钢，电机工业用的特殊物理性能钢、各种不锈钢，以及其他许多解放以前不能冶炼的钢种，现在都可以生产了。钢材方面，已经能够生产多种大型钢材、合金无缝钢管、造船钢板、汽车钢板、不锈钢板、矽钢片等技术复杂的产品；解放以前根本不能制造的生产飞机用的耐热钢板、钢丝绳等产品，现在也能够生产了。
    为了继续提高钢材自给率，更好地满足国民经济的需要，有关方面已经采取措施来解决目前还要进口的某些钢管和钢板的生产问题。预计在第二个五年计划期间，中国钢材自给率有可能进一步提高。
