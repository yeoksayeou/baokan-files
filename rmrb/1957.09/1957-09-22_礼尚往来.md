Reciprocity

    British People's View of Americans
    An anonymous columnist for the American "New York Herald Tribune," published a small advertisement in the British "Times":
    "Anyone dissatisfied with Americans and willing to state their reasons, please send a letter to Box R.543."
    The columnist received two hundred and nine replies. From these replies, he found some reasons why the British dislike Americans and listed ways for Americans to please the British. In addition to no longer speaking loudly in public places, no longer telling the British that the Americans won the war, no longer chewing gum all the time but dressing more elegantly, and no longer dancing the jitterbug, these ways also included: withdrawing military bases in Britain, resolving the problem of racial discrimination in the United States, and putting American women in their proper place, etc.

    American People's View of British People
    A columnist for the British "Daily Mirror," not to be outdone, also followed suit and anonymously published an advertisement in newspapers in several American cities:
    "A student studying American-British relations wants to know what annoying personality traits the British have..."
    The American "Washington Post" published the advertisement and put forward its own views:
    "The British are an outdated nation. They are extremely conservative. They claim to value civil service training, honest elections, and proper etiquette... In fact, these are absurd, annoying, and worthless. The days of the British are numbered..."

专栏：礼尚往来

    礼尚往来
    英国人看美国人
    美国“纽约先驱论坛报”驻巴黎的一名专栏作家，匿名在英国“泰晤士报”刊登了一个小广告：
    “凡对美国人不满而愿申述理由者，请投函信箱R.543号”。
    这位专栏作家收到了二百零九封回信。他从这些回信中，找出英国人不喜欢美国人的一些理由，并且列出了美国人讨英国人欢喜的办法。这些办法中除了不再那样在公共场所大声讲话，不再向英国人说战争是美国人打赢的，不再随时嚼口香糖而应该穿得文雅一些，不再跳摇摆舞之类而外，还包括：撤退在英国的军事基地，解决美国国内的种族歧视问题，把美国妇女放在适当的地位等等。
    美国人看英国人
    英国“每日镜报”的一位专栏作家不甘落后，他也如法泡制，在美国若干城市的报纸上匿名刊登了一则广告：
    “一个研究美、英关系的学生，希望知道英国人有那些令人讨厌的性格……”
    美国“华盛顿邮报”刊登了该项广告，同时提出了该报自己的看法：
    “英国人是过了时的民族。他们极端守旧。他们声称重视文官训练、诚实的选举、合适的礼节……其实这些都是荒唐的，令人讨厌而无存在价值的。英国人的日子不长了……”
