　　Continuously Shooting Poison Arrows to Attack Party Leadership
　　Zhou Ying Was Originally a Close Friend of Kang Ze and a Confidante of Hu Feng
　　Postal and Telecommunications Employees are Conducting Reasoned Struggle Against This Vicious Rightist Element
　　
    This Dispatch: Postal and Telecommunications employees and members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Postal and Telecommunications Branch recently conducted a serious reasoned struggle against the rightist Zhou Ying.

    Zhou Ying (female) is a member of the Central Committee of the RCCK and a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee, currently serving as the director of the Labor and Wage Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. This rightist element, under the guise of helping the Party in rectification during April, May, and June of this year, launched a frenzied attack on the Party. At the symposiums of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Socialist Academy, the Central Committee of the RCCK, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the RCCK, and the Labor and Wage Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications where she worked, she fabricated stories, distorted the truth, and continuously shot a series of extremely vicious poison arrows at the Party, the Party's leadership, and the socialist system.

    Echoing Chu Anping's "Party Empire" theory, at the Socialist Academy and the symposium of democratic parties in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, she repeatedly clamored that "it seems that one person is solving problems, the Party is replacing the government, and individuals are replacing the Party, not only non-Party members have no power, but even Party members have no power." She also arrogantly said: "This problem must be considered fundamentally from the central government."

    This rightist element extremely hated the great suppression of counterrevolutionaries movement. In her speech at the Socialist Academy, she said that the deviations in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries were "not isolated cases," and she slandered the suppression of counterrevolutionaries as "laws beyond the law," saying that "99% of those who were wrongly struggled against as counterrevolutionaries." She sang the same tune as Luo Longji. Luo Longji wanted to organize a so-called "rehabilitation committee," and she proposed in the Central Committee of the RCCK to establish a "mass organization" to analyze and handle opinions from the masses. She also fabricated a set of extremely absurd definitions, saying that "not directly seizing power cannot be considered counterrevolutionary," and that "Hu Feng only wanted to occupy a place in the literary and art circles, not to overthrow the leadership of the Party." She shamelessly defended Hu Feng's counterrevolutionary crimes everywhere, attempting to overturn the verdict against Hu Feng.

    This rightist element, at the beginning of the rectification movement, deliberately provoked the relationship between the democratic parties and the Communist Party. She falsely accused the democratic parties of only doing "eulogizing, gilding the lily, and adding fuel to the fire" for several years, and she provoked by saying that the democratic parties should not "do whatever the Communist Party tells them to do," attempting to incite opposition between the democratic parties and the Communist Party and "compete on equal footing." What was especially vicious was that she even incited Communist Party members and Party leading cadres to "rebel," she falsely accused the Communist Party of having "major problems," and she wanted Communist Party members and Party leading cadres to "stand up immediately and immediately take action" to open up the "big problems" locked in the "safe" and "confidential box," launching a "joint attack from inside and outside" on the Party. When the rightist elements were attacking the Party most frantically, during those days when dark clouds were churning in the sky of the motherland, she cheered and shouted everywhere, "It's really a national excitement like celebrating a happy event, it's so lively..."

    It is no accident that this rightist element is so vicious. Although she boasted that she was a "progressive person," she was actually a close friend of Kang Ze, the head of Chiang Kai-shek's secret service, for many years. As early as 1926, when she was in Japan, she colluded with the notorious counterrevolutionary Hu Feng, long bowing down at Hu Feng's door and becoming Hu Feng's confidante. Even after the first batch of counterrevolutionary materials of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique were published in the newspapers in 1955, when the national campaign to suppress counterrevolutionaries began, she still had extremely close ties with Hu Feng.

    After the anti-rightist struggle began in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, not only did she not honestly confess her reactionary words and deeds, but she ran to the home of an acquaintance at the Beijing Mining College and hid for a week; after returning to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, she is still hesitant and has not completely confessed. According to the materials initially revealed by the staff of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and members of the RCCK Postal and Telecommunications Branch, not only is Zhou Ying herself an anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist element, but there is also a group of accomplices around her. The speech she made at the Socialist Academy to attack the Party was jointly drafted by her and her husband, Nie Ganwu. These accomplices, like Zhou Ying, have not completely confessed.

### 连续施放毒箭攻击党的领导　周颖原是康泽的密友胡风的亲信　邮电部职工正对这个凶恶的右派分子进行说理斗争

　　连续施放毒箭攻击党的领导
　　周颖原是康泽的密友胡风的亲信
　　邮电部职工正对这个凶恶的右派分子进行说理斗争
    本报讯　邮电部职工和民革邮电部支部成员们，最近向右派分子周颖进行了严肃的说理斗争。
    周颖（女）是民革中央委员及北京市委委员，现任邮电部劳动工资处的处长。这个右派分子，在今年4、5、6月份，在以所谓帮助党整风的幌子下，向党进行了猖狂进攻。在邮电部、社会主义学院、民革中央、民革北京市委，以及她所在的邮电部劳动工资处的座谈会上，无中生有、颠倒黑白，对党、对党的领导、对社会主义制度，连续施放了一系列极其凶狠的毒箭。
    她曾和储安平的“党天下”一唱一和，在社会主义学院、在邮电部民主党派座谈会上，她一再叫嚣什么“看来就是一个人解决问题，以党代政，以人代党，不仅非党员无权，就是党员也无权”，她并狂妄地说：“这个问题根本上要从中央考虑”。
    这个右派分子对伟大的肃反运动极其仇恨。她在社会主义学院的发言中说肃反中的偏差“不是个别的”，她诬蔑肃反是“法外有法”，“肃反对象被斗错了的人就有99％”。她和罗隆基唱出同样的声调。罗隆基要组织所谓“平反委员会”，她就在民革中央提出要成立什么“群众性的组织”以分析处理群众中的意见。她还制造了一套极其荒唐的定义，说什么“不直接夺取政权就不能算是反革命”，说什么“胡风只是想在文艺界占点地位，并不是要推翻党的领导”，她还厚颜无耻地到处为胡风的反革命罪行辩护，企图为胡风翻案。
    这个右派分子，在整风运动一开始就别有用心地挑拨民主党派和共产党的关系，她诬蔑说：民主党派几年干的只是“歌功颂德、锦上添花、火上加油”的事，她又挑拨说民主党派不应该“共产党叫怎么办就怎么办”，企图挑起民主党派和共产党对立，“分庭抗礼”。尤其狠毒的是，她竟煽动共产党员和党员领导干部“起义”，她诬蔑共产党内有“重大问题”，她要共产党员和党的领导干部“马上站出来，立即出马”打开锁在“保险柜”、“保密箱”里的“大问题”，对党来个“内外夹攻”。当右派分子向党进攻最疯狂的时候，也是祖国天空乌云乱翻的那几天，她兴高采烈地到处叫喊什么“真是全国兴奋像办喜事，真热闹……。”
    这个右派分子所以这样凶狠，不是偶然的。虽然她吹嘘自己是什么“进步人士”，但实际上她是蒋介石手下特务头子康泽多年的密友。早在1926年她在日本时期，就同臭名昭著的反革命分子胡风勾搭在一起，长期拜倒在胡风门下，成为胡风的亲信。直到1955年全国肃反运动开始，胡风反革命集团的第一批反革命材料在报纸上公布以后，她仍同胡风有极其密切的联系。
    邮电部反右派斗争开始以后，她不但没有老老实实交代自己的反动言行，反而跑到北京矿业学院一个熟人家里躲了一个星期；回到邮电部以后，至今仍是吞吞吐吐没有彻底交代。根据邮电部的工作人员和民革邮电部支部成员们初步揭发的材料，不但周颖本人是个反党反社会主义的右派分子，在她的周围还有一批同谋者，她在社会主义学院向党进攻的发言稿，就是她和她的丈夫聂绀弩共同草拟的。这些同谋者至今也像周颖一样并未彻底交代。
