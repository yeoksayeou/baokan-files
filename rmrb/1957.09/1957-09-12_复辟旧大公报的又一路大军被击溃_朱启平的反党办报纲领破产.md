　　Another Route of the Army for Restoring the Old Ta Kung Pao Was Defeated
　　Zhu Qiping’s Anti-Party Newspaper Program Went Bankrupt
    This newspaper reports: Staff members of Ta Kung Pao recently exposed and criticized the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Zhu Qiping. Zhu Qiping was another route of the army attempting to restore the reactionary political direction of the old Ta Kung Pao.
    During the period of airing views and contending, Zhu Qiping was very active, wanting to overthrow the Party's leadership over the Beijing Ta Kung Pao and tamper with the political direction of Ta Kung Pao. On the one hand, he attacked the Ta Kung Pao’s newspaper management line, and on the other hand, he directly attacked the Ta Kung Pao’s Party organization.
    In early June, Zhu Qiping publicly put forward a newspaper program. He demanded to run a so-called "newspaper of the people's masses," a "folk newspaper." The "most important" thing for such a newspaper was to "report on matters of contradictions among the people," attempting to turn Ta Kung Pao into an anti-Party tool. He believed that "such a newspaper should be above the Party and the government, and if disputes arise as a result, it can even sue to the Supreme Court." Zhu Qiping viciously opposed the Party and the people, and slandered the People's Daily as not being a newspaper of the people. He clamored: "One day, the Communist Party will be eliminated, and the People's Daily must also be changed to a newspaper of the people's masses, not to mention other newspapers."
    After Zhu Qiping put forward this reactionary newspaper program, he not only spread it within the Ta Kung Pao, but also organized outsiders to circulate it.
    Zhu Qiping launched a rampant attack directly on the Party. His slogan was: "To run a good newspaper, we must first eliminate the three evils." And his so-called "eliminate the three evils" was to split the Party and ruin the Party. He also publicly demanded that several Party member leading comrades "step down" and demanded that Party members "revolt" and "tell the situation of the three evils" in order to achieve the purpose of splitting the Party. To this end, he posted big-character posters several times to "command" the Party members.
    In addition to publicly attacking the Party, Zhu Qiping also carried out many conspiracies inside and outside the newspaper. He made secret "gentlemen's agreements" with anti-Party elements, planned to bring down certain Party member leading cadres, and even after the anti-rightist struggle began, he strictly guarded this alliance of offense and defense, resisting criticism from the masses. Only after the masses carried out four sharp reasoning struggles against him did they defeat this "gentlemen's agreement."
    In order to realize his reactionary newspaper program, Zhu Qiping also tried his best to bring back Xu Ying and Peng Zigang, Party members and rightists, to the Ta Kung Pao. During the period of airing views and contending, he contacted Peng Zigang frequently, informing him. In a letter he wrote to Peng, he said gleefully: "I believe we will be able to join forces soon." He believed that as long as Xu and Peng returned, the Party group would immediately deteriorate, and his reactionary newspaper program could be realized immediately.
    Zhu Qiping has always been wearing a progressive coat, refusing to reform. Twenty years ago, he had infiltrated the Communist Party, and in 1937 he was expelled from the Party for publicly opposing the Party's decision. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, while serving as a special correspondent for the old Ta Kung Pao in the United States, he wrote many articles praising American imperialism, saying that the United States "has always led countries with new ideas." Until recently, he publicly advocated that China should accept so-called unconditional "American aid." After the exposure and criticism by the masses, Zhu Qiping's anti-communist prototype was fully exposed.

### 复辟旧大公报的又一路大军被击溃  朱启平的反党办报纲领破产

　　复辟旧大公报的又一路大军被击溃
　　朱启平的反党办报纲领破产
    本报讯　大公报工作人员最近揭发和批判了右派分子朱启平的反动言行。朱启平是企图复辟旧大公报反动政治方向的又一路大军。
    朱启平在鸣放期间，非常活跃，要推翻党对北京大公报的领导，篡改大公报的政治方向。他一方面向大公报的办报路线进攻，一方面直接向大公报的党组织进攻。
    6月初，朱启平公开提出了一个办报纲领。他要求办一张所谓“人民群众的报纸”，一张“民间报纸”。这样一张报纸，“最重要的”是“报道人民内部矛盾的事”，企图把大公报变成反党工具。他认为，“这样一张报纸，要凌驾于党和政府之上，如果因此而发生纠纷，甚至可以打官司打到最高法院”。朱启平恶毒地把党和人民群众对立起来，污蔑人民日报不是人民的报纸，他叫嚣说：“有一天，共产党会消灭，人民日报必须也改为人民群众的报纸，其他报纸更不必论。”
    朱启平提出这个反动的办报纲领之后，不但在大公报内部传播，而且组织外界人士传阅。
    朱启平直接向党发动了猖狂的进攻。他的口号是：“要办好报纸，先要除三害”。而他的所谓“除三害”，就是要分裂党、搞垮党。他还公开要求几个党员领导同志“下台”，并且要求党员“起义”“把三害的情况讲出来”，以达到分裂党的目的。为此，他连续几次贴出大字报，向党员“将军”。
    除了公开向党进攻之外，朱启平在报社内外还进行了许多阴谋活动。他与反党分子订立秘密“君子协定”，策划整垮某些党员领导干部，并且在反右派斗争开始之后，还严守这个攻守同盟，抗拒群众的批判。群众向他进行了四次尖锐的说理斗争之后，才把这个“君子协定”打垮。
    朱启平为了实现他的反动办报纲领，还极力活动，要把党内右派分子徐盈、彭子冈请回大公报来。鸣放期间，他与彭子冈联系频繁，通风报信。他在写给彭的信中，得意忘形地说：“相信我们不久就可以会师”。他相信，只要徐、彭回来，党组将立即变质，他的反动办报纲领马上可以实现。
    朱启平一向披着进步的外衣，拒绝改造。二十年前他曾混进共产党，1937年因公开反对党的决定被开除出党。抗战胜利后，他在担任旧大公报驻美特派员期间，写了许多歌颂美国帝国主义的文章，说美国“一向以意见崭新思想前进领袖各国”。直到最近，他还公开主张中国应当接受所谓无条件的“美援”。经过群众的揭发和批判，朱启平的反共的原形毕露。
