    The Sun of India
    ——Watching the Indian Color Feature Film "The Queen of Jhansi"
    Wu Xue
    This is a historical biographical film full of oriental colors, strong national sentiments, and a high degree of patriotism. The most important event in the 19th-century Indian people's struggle for independence was the 1857-1859 national uprising against British colonialism. This uprising was initiated by Indian soldiers' regiments under the East India Company, and the basic driving force directly supporting the uprising was the peasants and handicraftsmen. Because they were unorganized, and except for a very few, did not elect their own leaders, leadership remained in the hands of feudal lords. Because the leaders of the uprising did not agree on a general plan of action, and were not capable of directing a people's war, coupled with the British colonial authorities' policy of division, the uprising was cruelly suppressed and failed. Famous leaders who resolutely resisted the British included Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah, Tatya Tope, and Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Jhansi. The first two persisted until 1859, but were eventually betrayed and failed.
    The heroic Queen of Jhansi ended her life tragically. However, her noble national integrity wrote a magnificent page in the history of Indian independence. Indian Prime Minister Nehru wrote in his book "The Discovery of India": "One name stands out above all others, and is still revered in the people's memory, and that is Lakshmi Bai, or the Queen of Jhansi, a twenty-year-old girl who died in battle. The British general who opposed her called her 'the best and bravest' rebel leader."
    Biographical films are generally difficult to succeed. However, the director, Sohrab Modi, was able to precisely select very dramatic and touching plots to unfold the contradictions, reveal the characters, and highlight the theme, composing a harmonious and magnificent hymn in the face of this very solemn and vast subject matter. At the beginning of the film, the colonial nature of British imperialism's rule in India is pointed out very concisely through a few shots. On the screen, a British man announces: "The East India Company declares that Gangadhar Rao is the King of Jhansi... The Principality of Jhansi agrees to cede part of its territory to the East India Company, and the original army of Jhansi will be incorporated into the garrison of the East India Company." The king frowned helplessly, looking down at his fingers. The King of the Indian principality had to be decided by the British Governor-General, wasn't this the ultimate irony?
    Another scene shows a huge back view, stepping with steady steps, praying for freedom in front of the principality's throne. This is Rajguru, the nation's religious teacher. When he learned that the king had signed the treaty selling out the motherland without consulting him, he angrily left and placed his hope on the future savior of Jhansi, vowing to find a bride worthy of being the Queen of Jhansi for the king. The story unfolds along this line of contradiction.
    Rajguru, is played by the director Sohrab Modi himself. He successfully created a positive image of someone who is proficient in his country's history, inherits the ancient culture, loves his nation, and dedicates his life to the motherland. Especially the scene where he braves the flames of war, rushes into the castle, and encourages the Queen of Jhansi to fight for freedom, is deeply moving.
    The director left us with a deep impression on the grasp and portrayal of the development of the character of the Queen of Jhansi. For example, the queen's childhood is portrayed by just a few shots, such as climbing the elephant's trunk and preventing the angry elephant from advancing, outlining the stubbornness and boldness of the little girl who is not yet nine years old. After ten years of education, at the graduation ceremony, the king thanked the Rajguru with jewelry, but the queen used her oath to defend the motherland as a gift, which vividly shows that the queen is not only a brave person, but also a person with thoughts. The arrangement of the king and the queen watching the dance drama "Tiger and Flame" together, is also very clever in implying the inner growth of the characters. Later, when the British army announced that it would annex Jhansi, she resolutely defended the motherland, attempting to fight to the death. The Rajguru told her that she must contact the masses and wait for the opportunity. When the city was breached and the army was defeated, the queen had the idea of committing suicide to die for her country. The Rajguru told her to persevere and eliminate the enemy for the freedom of Jhansi. It was not until the end that she had the belief that truth would surely overcome everything. This development is very natural and credible. She is a hero, but she was not born a perfect person.
    Mehtab, who plays the Queen of Jhansi, created a typical character of an ancient Indian woman who is both passionate and reserved, brave and gentle, unrestrained and steady, with her superb acting skills and the temperament of an oriental woman. In the scenes of her swearing an oath at graduation, watching the dance drama "Tiger and Flame," the crowning of the prince, fighting for freedom, and the final praise of the setting sun and yearning for the future, she conveys many inner words through her eyes.
    The director is also very skilled in organizing the pictures and using "montage." For example, from the queen's solo escape with the prince to Kalpi to seek assistance, Rao ignored her and continued to sing and dance, indulging in pleasure. On one side, the British army was advancing towards Kalpi, and on the other side, the dance troupe was dancing in the garden. Different arms, different dance postures, the footsteps of the soldiers, the waist of the dancers, the wheels of the artillery carts turning, the skirts of the dancers flying, the horns, the band, the coordination of the pictures and the changes in the rhythm of the music, became tighter and tighter, until the audience was brought to the climax of the queen uniting Lala's team and making a final battle with the British army, sacrificing heroically.
    What is particularly worth mentioning is that the director handled the last great war scene in a manner that was both grand and poetic. On a hilly wilderness, the Queen of Jhansi took the lead, breaking through the enemy's cavalry and artillery. Just as she was pursuing the victory, she was suddenly heavily surrounded by the enemy's camel team. The screen shows the neck of the white horse, suddenly a burst of blood spilled down, immediately dyeing it red. Needless to say, the audience knows whose blood it is! Only to see the white horse, carrying the person who had fainted on the saddle, break through the encirclement, rush into the jungle, leaving the sound of hacking behind. The horse gently neighed, and a ascetic gently helped the person on the horse to lie down in the flowers. Cold water awakened the queen, and she slightly opened her hopeful eyes and said: "I believe that the motherland will surely gain freedom!" Then she closed her eyes. The ascetic said: "You are the sun of India!" He quietly placed eight red flowers on her body, and set fire to the thatched hut. The raging flames, accompanied by the gentle Indian-specific male singing, bring you so many associations and hints! This sound and this image will never be forgotten.
    The slight inadequacy of this film is that in order to highlight the Queen of Jhansi, the author has ignored the power of the people's anti-British struggle. In fact, the struggle against British colonialism among the people had long existed. Before this, uprisings had occurred more than once in various places. Therefore, it is felt that the historical background is not described enough. To a certain extent, it also weakens the brilliance of the character of the Queen of Jhansi. However, despite this, this is still another excellent Indian film after "Two Acres of Land" and "The Vagabond", and there are many aspects of film techniques that are worth learning from us. Especially this year is the centenary of the Indian people's anti-British uprising, it is even more meaningful to screen this film.

    印度的太阳
    ——看印度彩色故事片“章西女皇”
    吴雪
    这是一部充满东方色彩，有浓厚的民族情调和高度爱国主义精神的历史传记影片。十九世纪印度人民争取独立斗争的最重要事件，是1857—1859年的反抗英国殖民主义者的民族起义战争，发起这次起义的是当时隶属于东印度公司的印籍士兵联队，直接支持这次起义的基本动力，还是农民和手工业者。由于他们是没有组织的，并且除极少数以外，也没有推举出自己的领袖。领导权始终在封建主手里。由于起义的领导者们，彼此之间没有商量好总的行动计划，并且也没有能力指挥人民战争，加之英国殖民当局的分化政策，起义遂遭到惨酷的镇压而失败。坚决抗英的著名领袖，有摩利维·阿马德，唐蒂亚·托庇和拉克希米·巴依即章西女皇。前二人一直坚持到1859年，终于仍被出卖而失败。
    英勇的章西女皇以悲剧结束了她的一生。但她那崇高的民族气节，却在印度的独立史上，写下了壮丽的一页。印度总理尼赫鲁先生，在他的“印度的发现”一书中这样写道：“有一个人名突出于其他人之上，至今还在人民的追忆中被尊崇着的，那就是拉克希米·巴依，或名章西的王后，她是一个二十岁的姑娘，她死于战斗之中，与她敌对的英国将军称之为‘最优秀而最英勇的’义军领导者。”
    传记影片一般是比较难于成功的。但是本片的导演梭拉伯·莫地能在这个十分庄严而博大的题材面前，精确地选择了十分富于戏剧性的、生动感人的情节，来展开矛盾，揭示人物，烘托主题，构成一曲和谐而又雄伟的赞歌。影片一开始，非常精练的通过几个镜头，就点出英帝国主义在印度统治的殖民主义的本质。画面上一个英国人宣读：“东印度公司宣布，甘加达·拉奥为章西国王……章西公国同意将部分领土割让给东印度公司，并将章西原有军队并入东印度公司驻军。”国王无可奈何的皱了一下眉，低头看着自己的手指。印度公国的国王要由英国的总督来决定，这不是天大的讽刺吗？
    另一画面推出一个巨大的背影，踏着稳重的脚步，在公国宝座前为自由而祈祷着。这就是国家宗教的教师拉吉。当他知道了国王不与他商量就签字出卖了祖国时，愤而出走，把希望寄托在未来的章西救星，发誓要为国王寻找一个配做章西王后的新娘。故事就沿着这个矛盾的线索展开了。
    国师拉吉，由导演梭拉伯·莫地自己扮演，他成功的创造了一个精通本国历史，继承古老文化，热爱自己的民族，将毕生精力献给了祖国的正面形象。尤以他冒着烽火，冲入城堡，鼓励章西女皇为自由而战的一场戏，深为动人。
    导演在掌握与刻划章西女皇这一人物的发展上，给我们留下了深刻的印象。如女皇的幼年，只通过爬象鼻子，阻当愤怒的大象前进等几个镜头，就把不到九岁的小姑娘的倔强和气魄勾画出来了。经过十年教育之后，在结业典礼上，国王用珠宝来答谢国师，皇后却以捍卫祖国的誓言来作为礼物，这就生动的写出女皇已不仅是一个勇敢的人，而且是有思想的人了。国王与女皇同观舞剧“虎与火焰”的安排，对人物内心成长的暗示，也是很巧妙的。后来在英军宣布要并吞章西时，她坚决保卫祖国，企图与之一拼，国师告以必须联络群众等待时机。在城破兵败时，女皇又萌自杀殉国之念，国师又告以为了章西自由，应再接再厉，消灭敌人。一直到最后她才有了真理必然战胜一切的信念。这样的发展非常自然，令人可信。她是个英雄，但不是生下地来就是一个完人。
    扮演章西女皇的梅达伯，以她精湛的演技，东方女性的气质，创造了一个既热情又含蓄，既勇敢又温柔，既奔放又稳重的一个古代印度妇女的典型性格。她在结业宣誓，看舞剧“虎与火焰”，太子加冕，为自由而战，以及最后的赞美夕阳向往未来等几场戏中，通过她的一双眼睛，道出许多内心的语言。
    导演在组织画面，运用“蒙太奇”上，也是十分娴熟的。比如从女皇带着太子单骑突围，到卡尔皮去求援助时，拉奥置之不理，依旧歌舞升平，花天酒地，一面是英军向卡尔皮进逼，一面是舞队在花园起舞，不同的兵种，不同的舞姿，战士的脚步，舞女的腰肢，炮车轮子在转，舞女裙子在飞，军号，乐队，画面配合和音乐节奏的变化，越来越紧，一直把观众带到女皇联合了拉拉的队伍，与英军作最后决战，壮烈牺牲的高潮。
    特别值得一提的，是导演把最后一个伟大的战争场面，处理得既有气魄又富于诗意。在一个丘陵起伏的荒原上，章西女皇身先士卒，冲破了敌人的马队炮队，正乘胜追击的时候，突被敌人骆驼队重重包围。画面上显出白马的脖子，忽然一阵鲜血洒下，立刻把它染红了。不用说观众心里都知道那是谁的血呀！只见那骑白马，驮着那昏倒在鞍上的人，冲出重围，闯入丛林，把砍杀声留在了后面。那马轻轻一嘶，一个苦行者把马上人轻轻扶在花丛中躺下，凉水激醒了女皇，她微睁充满希望的双眼说：“我相信祖国一定会得到自由！”随即合上了双眼。苦行者说：“你是印度的太阳！”静静在她身上放了八朵红花，顺手把茅屋烧化，熊熊的火焰，伴着轻轻的印度特有的男声歌唱，它带给你多少联想，多少暗示啊！这声音这形象使你永远不会忘记。
    这部影片微感不足的是作者为了突出章西女皇，忽略了人民反英的力量，事实上在人民中间反对英国殖民主义的斗争，早就存在。这次以前各处已经不止一次的发生过起义。因之令人感到对历史背景还描写得不够。在一定程度上也减弱了章西女皇这个人物形象的光彩。但是，尽管如此，这仍是继“两亩地”“流浪者”之后的又一部优秀的印度影片，在电影技巧方面也有很多值得我们学习的地方，尤其今年正是印度人民反英起义一百周年，放映这部影片就更有意义了。
