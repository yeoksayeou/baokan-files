Sentient and Insentient
　　Bu Wen
In this anti-Rightist struggle, there are two relatively typical mental attitudes. One is the beastly nature, the cold-bloodedness of the Rightists; the other is the sentimentality of some anti-Rightist elements, a truly overwhelming tenderness, wanting to speak but hesitating.

It is said to be: love for their talent!

Little do they know, whether you love them or not, it is these "talented" people who are clamoring: the Party cannot lead art, the Party cannot lead science. They clamor that the Party cannot do this or that, and everything should not have the Party's leadership. Haven't the "talents" of Peking University already declared that "talents and beauties" should be in power?

But if talent is used against the people, then the more talent one has, the more poisonous it becomes. Therefore, we should dig out its poisonous roots even more so that it can benefit the people!

It is also said: There is always some nostalgia for old revolutionary comrades!

Little do they know, you are nostalgic, but they are not. If they were nostalgic, how could they forget the Party's history of arduous struggle, how could they forget the blood shed by the martyrs and the revolutionary cause they left behind? If they were nostalgic, how could they forget the oath they took when they joined the Party and instead fall into the arms of the enemy?

Moreover, the so-called "old" of the Rightists is often just the period when their anti-Party conspiracies lay dormant, often the period when they were gathering strength and recruiting followers, often the period when they were arranging confidants and planning strategies. Haven't many materials already demonstrated this?

These individual careerists have never thoroughly reformed themselves, but instead wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism to compete with the Party for fame and fortune. Due to small personal achievements, they consider themselves special, form their own cliques, and gradually drift away from the Party, eventually going to the anti-Party side. This transformation process of theirs is our living teaching material. If we do not make up our minds to thoroughly reform our non-proletarian ideology, what unimaginable consequences will there be!

Or it is said: They are just unarmed intellectuals, why make such a big deal out of it?

Little do they know, the so-called intellectuals have two weapons: one is an eloquent pen, and the other is an eloquent tongue. Both the tongue and the pen are very powerful!

The ancients described the magic of evil sorcerers as being able to summon wind and rain, but the pens and tongues of the Rightists can ignite the raging fire of evil in people's hearts and fan the cold, crooked winds in people's chests. Haven't the many materials that have been exposed proven that the pens and tongues of the Rightists are even more powerful than the magic of evil sorcerers?

The so-called scholars rebelling will not succeed in three years may be true in some cases. No matter how powerful the scholars are, if they violate the will of the people, the people can overthrow them. However, we must not therefore ignore them. Now, there are plenty of well-fed, pampered scholars who "eat their fill all day long and speak only of unrighteousness" (opposing socialism). Some are fat-faced, oily-headed, and rich scholars with capital and followers, and some are foreign scholars who are in China but have their hearts in England and America! The foreign scholars look up to the new weapons of the foreigners, and the rich scholars use the old conspiracies of the rich. If we don't disarm such scholars, they will rebel in a big way. Haven't they already created a chaotic atmosphere in our lives and messed up our work in some places?

It is good to be sentimental, but if you are sentimental to the enemies of the people, you are too heartless to the people. You must know that no matter how sentimental you are to them, they are heartless to you. In the hearts of the Rightists, there is a raging fire of hatred burning. Their goal is very clear: to burn down our socialist mansion!

　　有情和无情
　　布文
    在这次反右派斗争中，有两种精神面貌较有典型，一种是：右派分子的人面兽心，冷酷无情；一种是部分反右派分子的温情主义，真是柔情万缕，欲说还休。
    据说是：爱他们的才华！
    殊不知，你爱他不爱，不就是这些有“才华”的人们嚷嚷：党不能领导艺术，党不能领导科学，他们嚷嚷，党这不能那也不能，一切都不应当有党的领导；北京大学的“才子”们，不是已经宣告说，应当让“才子佳人”们当政吗？
    可是才华为反人民而用，那么愈有才华便愈加有毒，因此我们就愈加应当挖出他的毒根来，才能够为人民造福！
    又说是：对老革命同志，总有些念旧！
    殊不知，你念旧他不念旧。他如果念旧，怎么忘记了党艰苦斗争的历史，怎么忘记了先烈们流的血与他们留下的革命事业？他如果念旧，他怎么忘记了自己入党时的誓言竟倒到敌人的怀里去呢？
    何况，所谓右派分子的旧，常常只是他们反党阴谋蛰伏的时期，常常是他们养精蓄锐招兵买马的时期，常常是他们布置心腹，谋划韬略的时期，很多材料不早就说明这一点了吗？
    这些个人野心家，从未彻底改造过自己，而是披着马列主义的外衣，向党来争名夺利，由于个人小小的成就，便自视特殊，自成一党，逐日与党远离，终至于走到反党的方面去。他们这一段蜕化过程，是我们的活教材，如果不下决心，彻底改造自己非无产阶级的思想意识，后患何堪设想！
    或者说：不过是手无寸铁的文人，何必要搞得这样厉害？
    殊不知，所谓文人有两样武器，一个是三寸不烂之笔，一个是三寸不烂之舌。这舌与笔都是很厉害的！
  古人形容妖道魔法，都说是能呼风唤雨，而右派分子的笔与舌，却能去点起人们心头熊熊之邪火，煽起人们胸中寒冷的歪风。揭发出来的许多材料，不是证明右派分子的笔与舌比妖道的魔法还厉害吗？
    所谓秀才造反，三年不成，在某种情况下可能是真实的。秀才们无论如何神通广大，但如果违反了人民的意志，人民就能够把他们打倒。不过决不能因此就把他们置之不理。现在“饱食终日，言必反义”（反对社会主义）的秀才们有的是油头胖脸，有资本，有喽啰的阔秀才，有的是身在中国，心在英美的洋秀才！洋秀才仰望着洋人的新武器，阔秀才运用着阔人的旧阴谋。这样的秀才，如果不缴他们的械，他们就要大反而特反了，在有的地方，他们不是已经在我们生活里搞得乌烟瘴气，在我们工作中捣的乱七八糟吗？
    多情是好的，但如果对人民的敌人多情，对人民就太无情了。要知道，不管你怎样对他多情，他是无情于你的，在右派分子的心中，燃烧着猛烈的仇恨之火，他们的目的很明确：烧毁我们的社会主义大厦！
