    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 7th. The experience of all-round increased production of cotton and wheat double cropping in Hubei Province has greatly interested more than 280 representatives from eleven provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
    These representatives are members of the Cotton Visiting Delegation organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, including agricultural labor models from cotton-producing areas in various provinces, administrative and technical cadres from government agricultural departments, cotton experts from the East China and Central China Agricultural Science Institutes, and professors from agricultural colleges in various regions. They visited cotton and wheat double cropping areas in Hubei Province for half a month, ending on the 4th.
    Hubei Province has approximately eight million mu of land under annual double cropping (cotton and wheat), accounting for 90% of the province's total cotton acreage. These double-cropped cotton fields, following the universal bumper harvest of wheat and barley in the first half of the year, are now approaching the cotton harvest season. In addition to listening to the introduction of the experience of all-round increased production of cotton and wheat double cropping in Hubei Province and Tianmen and Xinzhou counties, the representatives from various provinces also visited some townships in Tianmen and Xinzhou counties. They learned that Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County, with nearly 20,000 mu of double-cropped cotton fields, is expected to produce an average of 125 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 30% over last year and 3.63 times that of 1950; at the same time, the average yield of wheat per mu has also increased by 63% compared to 1950. In Dadukou Township, Xinzhou County, which has a large area of high-yield cotton and wheat double cropping, the average yield of wheat per mu this year is 260 jin, and cotton is expected to reach 140 jin of ginned cotton.
    Cotton experts in the visiting delegation made a scientific assessment of Hubei Province's experience in all-round increased production of cotton and wheat double cropping. They unanimously agreed that Hubei Province's systematic experience in combining strengthened leadership, technological reform, and management in cotton and wheat double cropping is basically suitable for adoption in the cotton and wheat double cropping areas of southern provinces. The representatives from various provinces also held separate discussions on the experience of Hubei Province in conjunction with the specific conditions of their own provinces. They expressed that after returning, they would study and promote these experiences in accordance with local conditions, and strive for all-round increased production of cotton and wheat double cropping.
    The national area of cotton and grain double cropping is about 27 million mu, accounting for about 30% of the total cotton area in the country. These double-cropped cotton areas, except for a part in Shaanxi and Henan provinces, are mainly distributed in the southern provinces. For a long time, people have had many doubts and resistance to the cotton and grain double cropping system. They believed that there were insurmountable contradictions in double cropping, and that only one of cotton or wheat could be guaranteed to increase production, and that both could not increase production at the same time. This conservative argument has been criticized in recent years.

### 十一省农业代表汇集湖北  学习棉麦两熟全面增产经验

    十一省农业代表汇集湖北
    学习棉麦两熟全面增产经验
    新华社武汉7日电　湖北省棉、麦两熟全面增产的经验，使江苏、浙江等十一个省的二百八十多名代表感到极大的兴趣。
    这些代表是农业部组织的棉花参观代表团的成员，包括各省产棉区的农业劳动模范、政府农业部门的行政干部和技术干部、华东、华中两农业科学研究所的棉花专家和各地农学院的教授。他们在湖北省棉、麦两熟地区参观访问达半个月，到4日结束。
    湖北省一年两熟（棉、麦）的棉田约有八百万亩，占全省棉田总面积的90％。这些两熟棉田继上半年大、小麦普遍丰收以后，目前又快到棉花丰收的季节。各省代表除听取了湖北省和天门、新洲两县的棉麦两熟全面增产的经验介绍以外，还参观访问了天门、新洲两县的一些乡。他们了解到：天门县小庙乡近两万亩两熟棉田，预计平均每亩可产皮棉一百二十五斤，比去年增加30％，比1950年增加三点六三倍；同时，小麦的每亩平均产量也比1950年增加了63％。大面积棉麦两熟丰产的新洲县大渡乡，今年的小麦每亩平均产量是二百六十斤，棉花预计可以达到皮棉一百四十斤。
    参观代表团中的棉花专家们对湖北省棉麦两熟全面增产的经验作了科学的鉴定。他们一致认为，湖北省在棉麦两熟栽培中一贯强调加强领导、技术改革和经营管理相结合的系统经验，基本上适合南方各省的棉麦两熟地区采用。各省代表还专门就湖北省的经验，结合本省的具体条件，分别座谈。他们表示回去后要因地制宜地研究和推广这些经验，争取棉麦两熟全面增产。
    全国棉、粮两熟的面积约有二千七百多万亩，占全国棉田总面积的30％左右。这些两熟棉区除陕西、河南两省有一部分外，主要分布在南方各省。长期以来，人们对棉、粮两熟制有过不少的怀疑和抵触情绪。他们认为两熟栽培存在着难以克服的矛盾，棉花或者小麦只能保住一头增产，不能使两头都增产。这种保守主义的论调在最近几年曾经受到批判。
