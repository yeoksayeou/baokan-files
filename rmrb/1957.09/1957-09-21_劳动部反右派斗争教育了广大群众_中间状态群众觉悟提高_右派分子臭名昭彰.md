The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Labor has achieved a great victory. During the struggle, the ministry and its various departments and bureaus held more than 200 large and small forums and debates, with more than 500 people speaking. Many people who originally held a middle-of-the-road attitude are now actively participating in the struggle, and the masses' political awareness has significantly improved, with most people beginning to lean to the left. With the in-depth development of the movement, Rightists engaging in behind-the-scenes activities and Rightists within the Party have been continuously exposed.

In the anti-Rightist struggle, many comrades, with reason and evidence, and using their personal experiences and comparisons before and after liberation, thoroughly criticized the Rightists. For example, Xu Gongmin of the Wage Bureau used his personal experience of the political status and living conditions of workers in the old and new societies to refute the Rightist Liang Shichang's fallacies slandering the new society, which deeply moved the masses, some even shedding tears. After profound criticism, the broad masses have recognized the ugly faces of the Rightists. For example, in the criticism of the Rightist Ye Huazhan, some people initially only thought that Ye was corrupt, degenerate, arrogant, and conceited; after systematic criticism, they realized Ye's reactionary political nature and actively participated in the struggle. Another example is Comrade Liu Meide, who was taciturn in the early stages of the anti-Rightist campaign. As the struggle deepened, his understanding gradually improved. He originally thought that his lover was only ideologically backward, had some dissatisfaction with the leadership, and was just complaining. However, after analyzing some of the erroneous remarks in his lover's letter, he found that they were exactly the same as the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the Rightists. He was greatly shocked, which triggered a fierce ideological struggle. Finally, he resolutely exposed the Rightist remarks in his lover's letter and actively joined the anti-Rightist struggle.

The Rightists, under the masses' just rebuttal, have become infamous and isolated. Most of them have begun to confess their crimes and surrender their weapons.

Currently, the Ministry of Labor is carrying out systematic debates on the Rightists' reactionary remarks regarding the Party's leadership, democracy and freedom, human nature and Party spirit, personnel system, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and continues to dig out the Rightists hidden in the depths, striving for the complete victory of the anti-Rightist struggle.

    劳动部反右派斗争教育了广大群众
    中间状态群众觉悟提高　右派分子臭名昭彰
    本报讯　劳动部的反右派斗争已取得很大胜利。在斗争中，部和各司、局召开的大小座谈会、辩论会有二百多次，发言的有五百多人。许多原来抱中间态度的人，现在都积极参加了斗争，群众的政治觉悟有显著提高，大部分人开始向左转。随着运动的深入发展，一些幕后活动的右派分子和党内右派分子不断被揭露出来。
    在反右派斗争中，许多同志都有理有据并且以亲身经历和解放前后对比的方法，对右派分子进行了透彻的批判。如工资局徐公民以亲身经历的新旧社会工人政治地位和生活情况驳斥了右派分子梁世昌诬蔑新社会的谬论，群众深受感动，有的甚至流了泪，经过深刻的批判，广大群众已认清了右派分子的丑恶面貌。如对右派分子叶华湛的批判，开始时有的人只认为叶是腐化、堕落、狂妄自大；经过系统的批判后，才认识到叶的反动的政治本质，并积极参加了斗争。又如柳美德同志在反右派初期沉默寡言，随着斗争的深入，认识逐渐提高，原以为他的爱人，不过是思想落后，对领导有些不满，发发牢骚而已，但将他爱人来信中的一些错误言论，集中起来分析以后，发现与右派分子的反党、反社会主义的言论如出一辙，他才大吃一惊，引起了思想上的激烈斗争，最后终于坚决地揭发了他爱人来信中的右派言论，积极投入了反右派斗争。
    右派分子在群众正义的驳斥下，已经臭名昭彰，陷于孤立。他们中大多数已经开始认罪，交械投降。
    现在，劳动部正在开展对右派分子反动言行中关于党的领导、民主和自由、人性和党性、人事制度、肃反等问题，有系统地进行辩论，并继续挖掘隐蔽在深处的右派分子，争取反右派斗争的彻底胜利。
