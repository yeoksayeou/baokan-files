Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd – A surge of extensively airing views has swept through Tianjin among workers, shop assistants, government staff, and school teachers and students. Suburban farmers have also launched a socialist debate.

In the past twenty days, over nine hundred factories, shops, and government offices across the city have held countless group meetings and symposiums, posting over 300,000 big-character posters and raising over 500,000 suggestions. The State-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory posted 10,000 big-character posters within four days, raising approximately 20,000 opinions. The buildings and makeshift sheds in many factories are densely covered with big-character posters, with some overlapping four or five layers. Radio broadcasters and mimeographed newsletters in many factories, shops, and government offices have become venues for the masses to express their views. Factory staff reception rooms and big-character poster writing services are crowded with people all day long, and staff work tirelessly through the night.

These colorful big-character posters take the form of short opinions, cartoons, satirical poems, clappers, comic dialogues, couplets, and songs. The content includes criticisms of the Party's work and the work style of Party member cadres, opinions on national political life, and criticisms and suggestions on production management, welfare, wages, and rewards. The issues revealed in the big-character posters are sharp, and the titles are eye-catching. For example, one person said in a big-character poster titled "No One Collects Rent" that he had moved into the factory's dormitory for more than a year, but no one had asked him for rent. A big-character poster titled "Thirteen Years of Reserves" stated that more than 1,000 jin of zinc calcium powder were purchased in January of this year, but only 60 jin were used by the end of August, and the remaining portion could be used for thirteen years. Employees in many units also cited specific facts in meetings and on big-character posters, frankly offering criticisms and opinions to the leaders of their respective units.

Many leaders of units have welcomed and supported the airing of views by employees with the spirit of "rejoicing in hearing of mistakes and correcting them if they exist." They take time out of their busy schedules to view the big-character posters. Some factory directors, upon seeing criticisms of themselves, immediately wrote big-character posters, expressing their willingness to humbly accept the opinions. Many leaders not only keep abreast of the situation and analyze problems at any time, but also talk to some employees who have concerns about airing their views, encouraging them to express their opinions. Rectification groups have been generally established in various units, with leaders personally serving as the heads of the groups. They promptly study the opinions of the masses, and immediately improve what can be improved. According to statistics from more than one hundred units under the state-owned industrial and transportation departments, more than 2,000 problems have been solved in the past twenty days.

After fighting back against the counterattacks and liquidations of illegal landlords and rich peasant elements, suburban farmers are now engaging in debates on issues such as the unified purchase and sale of grain.

    群众有话就讲　领导有过必改
    天津工农商学各界大鸣大放
    新华社天津23日电　天津市在工人、店员、机关工作人员以及学校师生中，已经掀起了大鸣大放的热潮。郊区农民也展开了社会主义大辩论。
    全市九百多个工厂、商店和机关，在最近二十天内举行了无数次的小组会和座谈会，张贴了三十多万张大字报，提出的意见在五十万条以上。国营第二棉纺织厂在四天内就贴出了一万张大字报，提出了大约二万条意见。许多工厂的建筑物和院内搭设的席棚四周大字报贴得密密层层，有的重叠四、五层之多。许多工厂、商店和机关的广播器、油印小报等都成为群众鸣放的园地。工厂的职工接待室和大字报代书处，整天地挤满了人，工作人员通宵达旦地忙碌着。
    这些五颜六色的大字报有简短的意见或漫画、讽刺诗、快板、相声、对联和歌曲等形式，内容包括对党的工作和党员干部作风的批评、对国家政治生活问题发表的意见以及对生产经营、生活福利、工资奖励等各方面工作的批评和建议。大字报揭发的问题尖锐，标题也十分醒目。如有人在一张“没人收房租”的大字报中说，他自己搬进工厂的宿舍已经一年多，但没有人向他要房钱。在一张题为“十三年的储备量”的大字报中说：今年1月购进了锌钙粉一千多斤，到8月底只用了六十多斤，剩余的部分还可用十三年。许多单位的职工还在会议和大字报上举出具体事实，对所在单位的领导人员坦率地提出批评和意见。
    许多单位的领导人员都以“闻过则喜、有过必改”的精神，欢迎并支持职工大鸣大放。他们都在百忙中抽出时间观看大字报。有些厂长看到对自己的批评还马上写了大字报，表示虚心接受意见。许多领导人员不仅随时了解情况、分析问题，还和一些对鸣放有顾虑的职工谈话，鼓励他们发表意见。各单位普遍成立了整风小组，组长都由领导人员亲自担任。他们及时地研究群众意见，能够改进的立即加以改进。据国营工业交通部门所属一百多个单位的统计，在最近二十天内，已经解决了二千多个问题。
    郊区农民对不法地主、富农分子的反攻倒算进行斗争后，正对粮食统购统销等问题展开辩论。
