How the American Conspiracy to Subvert Syria Went Bankrupt
    Chong Ru
    On the night of August 12, Damascus Radio suddenly broadcast a message: The Syrian government had uncovered a U.S. imperialist-orchestrated subversion conspiracy. This news made the Syrian people feel an uncontrollable anger towards U.S. imperialism once again.

    So far, although the detailed ins and outs of the conspiracy case have not been fully announced, according to the communique issued by the Syrian government on August 12 and the materials revealed by Syrian Army Captain Atiya in a radio broadcast on August 15, we can know the course of the failure of this American conspiracy.

    It turned out that after countless failures of anti-Syrian conspiracies, the United States transferred Howard Stone, a U.S. subversion "expert," to Damascus about three months ago. Stone had shown his talents in the subversion cases in Iran and Guatemala. At the same time, the United States also instructed the Syrian traitor Shishakli to sneak into Damascus. The United States also colluded with Colonel Husseini, the Syrian military attaché in Rome, and let him also secretly sneak into Damascus. After they gathered in Damascus, the American embassy prepared various conditions for them and immediately began to carry out conspiracy activities in the army.

    On July 27, a friend of Syrian Army Captain Abdullah Atiya came to his house. This friend vaguely indicated that he hoped the captain could join a secret organization related to the United States. But he did not talk about this issue in more detail, but just let the captain consider it further.

    The next day, the guest came again and immediately talked about yesterday's matter. The captain's tone seemed somewhat "loose," and finally agreed to further contact with the American side.

    After his friend contacted the American embassy, ​​the time for the appointment was determined. But the time was temporarily changed, and finally they arrived at the home of a female staff member of the American embassy on Raoud Street at 11:00 pm on August 4. They met the American conspiracy "expert" Stone in the basement of this house.

    After a brief general conversation, they gradually moved to the main topic.

    "In order to 'liberate Arab countries,' we must get rid of the current Syrian government. How much power can you control?" Stone expressed great concern about this.

    "Currently, I only control one battalion."

    "Do you believe you can control it?"

    "Yes," the captain said firmly.

    Stone nodded in approval, and then asked: "How do you plan to carry out this activity?"

    "Am I the only one carrying out this task, or are there other people?" the captain asked.

    "No, activities will be carried out in Damascus and other areas," Stone said, inadvertently revealing a smug look.

    "Then you should let me meet other people participating in this activity, so that we can plan and work together."

    Stone seemed a little hesitant about this request, and the captain expressed his displeasure.

    "What's the situation in your army?" Stone wanted to use this question to gloss over the captain's request just now.

    "If your purpose in talking to me is just to understand our military secrets, then it's not very meaningful," the captain said angrily, and stood up to leave.

    Stone immediately ran over to hold the captain back and comforted him with kind words. Finally, Stone decided to introduce the captain to another conspirator soon.

    At 11:00 pm on August 5, Atiya met with Stone again. This time they talked about the issue of money. Stone readily agreed that he would go to a certain car on Fardous Street at 9:00 am the next day to collect the money. They also agreed to meet at a coffee shop on Mohajireen Street on the morning of the 8th. Stone also told him that if he could not go that day, the date would be postponed.

    The captain went on the 8th but did not meet Stone. He went again the next day and waited for a long time, then Stone's wife came. She agreed to meet with the captain again at 4:00 pm on the 11th to lead him to meet the conspiracy leader she had mentioned earlier.

    At the appointed time on the 11th, Stone's wife took Ataya and his friend to a car parked across the street. Stone was already waiting in the car. After closing the car door, Stone took them for a stroll on the street for about half an hour. Only when there were no other vehicles following behind did the car stop in front of a house on Abu Romani Street.

    Stone asked the captain's friend to stay in the car but took away the car key. Stone led the captain into the room on the left side of the basement and went out. About a minute later, the door opened, and a man wearing a straw hat and with a long beard came in. If the captain's eyesight hadn't been good, he simply wouldn't have recognized that this person was Colonel Husseini, the Syrian military attaché in Rome.

    After Husseini warmly embraced the captain, he said: "Someone told me many names, but I only chose you."

    "How did you come back?" The captain felt very surprised.

    "I came in disguise with a Saudi Arabian passport."

    "Has anyone discovered you?"

    "Don't be afraid of anything, everything is prepared."

    There was no one in the room, but the military attaché's voice was still very low:

    "This activity of ours is not cheap, we will get three to four hundred million dollars."

    After the captain expressed his willingness to accept all his orders, Husseini first swore an oath in front of the Koran, and then asked the captain to swear an oath. After the oath was completed, an American came in and told Husseini that the plane was waiting for him. Husseini nodded, and the American went out again. Husseini continued to learn about the situation in the captain's battalion, and finally said this:

    "We need three infantry brigades and one anti-tank brigade. Now, except for Qata, it can be guaranteed that activities will be successful in other places. We will smoothly occupy villages and cities. …"

    After agreeing on the time and code for the riot, Husseini said goodbye to the captain and hurried out. At this time, Jeton, the vice-consul of the American embassy, ​​came in and asked the captain to wait for a while before leaving. After about an hour, Jeton came in and told the captain: Husseini had already taken a plane to Rome. Then he sent the captain away. On the same day, another Syrian officer was also led to the residence of an American embassy staff member. After this officer entered this residence, he was surprised to find that Shishakli, who had been driven away in 1954, was laughing and talking with three American women. Seeing the officer come in, the three women left.

    "I came back this time at the risk of my life. If I don't make a name for myself in Syria, I will never go back," Shishakli said bluntly to the officer, "The characteristic of our activity this time is speed. If you cooperate with us, your future will be very bright. You should contact more officers, and we will provide you with a large amount of money. If you and the officers have negotiated, you can just tell us and we can take action. …"

    After the conversation, Shishakli left. Before leaving, he also asked the officer to frequently contact the Americans about the activities. The officer was locked in the room for about an hour and a half, and then an American woman came in and let him out.

    It is said that Military Attaché Husseini arrived in Rome on the same day by American military plane, and Shishakli was also secretly sent to Beirut by the Americans in an embassy car. …

    However, money cannot buy the conscience of honest officers. Several officers, including Atiya, who contacted Stone, Husseini, and Shishakli, reported the situation to the relevant authorities from the first day the incident occurred. They were working with this group of conscienceless conspirators under the instructions of the relevant Syrian authorities.

    After the incident occurred, the Syrian government immediately took measures to strengthen public security and arrested some officers related to the conspiracy case. On August 13, the Syrian government expelled the American conspiracy expert Stone, the Second Secretary of the American Embassy, and the Vice-Consul from the country within twenty-four hours. The United States also tried to deny this crime, but the evidence was irrefutable, and denial was futile. Mass rallies were held in various parts of Syria, strongly protesting the American conspiracy activities.

    The price of independence is noble! The Syrian people have undergone hundreds of years of arduous and tortuous struggles to exchange for today's independence and freedom. The army is the force that directly protects the security of their country. Through the exposure of this conspiracy case, the Syrian people more firmly support the policy of active neutrality implemented by the Syrian government and love their army even more. They unanimously demanded to strengthen unity and heighten vigilance in order to maintain Syria's sacred independence. (Attached picture)

    美国颠覆叙利亚的阴谋是怎样破产的
    重如
    8月12日深夜，大马士革广播电台突然播送了一条消息：叙利亚政府破获了美帝国主义所策划的颠覆阴谋案。这个消息使叙利亚人民对美帝国主义再一次感到了不可抑止的愤怒。
    迄今为止，虽然阴谋案的详细始末尚未全部公布，但根据8月12日叙利亚政府所发表的公报和8月15日叙利亚陆军上尉阿提亚在电台广播中所揭发的材料，可以知道这个美国阴谋破产的经过。
    原来美国在无数次反叙利亚的阴谋失败以后，在大约三个月以前，把美国颠覆活动“专家”霍华德·斯通调到了大马士革。斯通曾经在伊朗和危地马拉的颠覆案中显露过头角。同时美国也指令叙利亚的叛徒施舍克里潜入大马士革。美国还勾结了叙利亚驻罗马的武官侯赛尼上校，让他也秘密潜入大马士革。当他们在大马士革集中以后，美国大使馆便为他们准备了各种条件，立即开始在军队中进行阴谋活动。
    7月27日，叙利亚陆军上尉阿卜杜拉·阿提亚的家里来了他的一位朋友。这位朋友含含糊糊地表示，希望上尉能参加一个与美国有关的秘密活动组织。但是他对这个问题并没作更多的深谈，而只是让上尉作进一步的考虑。
    第二天，客人又来了，立刻又谈到了昨天的事情。上尉的口气似乎有些“松动”，最后同意可以同美国方面作进一步的联系。
    他的朋友和美国大使馆联系以后，确定了约会的时间。但时间临时更改，最后他们在8月4日晚上十一点钟到达拉乌德街的美国大使馆某女职员家中，在这一家的地下室里遇见了美国阴谋“专家”斯通。
    经过一段简短的一般性谈话以后，他们逐渐转入了正题。
    “为了‘解放阿拉伯国家’，我们必须把叙利亚现政府搞掉。你所能控制的有多少力量？”斯通对这一点表示很关心。
    “目前我只控制了一个营。”
    “你相信能控制住它吗？”
    “能够。”上尉口气很坚决。
    斯通点头称好，接着又问：“关于这一活动你打算怎样进行？”
    “是我一个人执行这个任务呢，还是也有其他的人？”上尉问道。
    “不，大马士革和其他地区都要进行活动的。”斯通说这句话的时候，不觉流露出了洋洋得意的神情。
    “那么你们应该让我认识其他参加这一活动的人，以便共同计划，共同工作。”
    斯通对这一要求显得有些犹豫，上尉表示很不愉快。
    “你们军队中的情况怎么样？”斯通想用这个问题来把上尉刚才提出的要求滑过去。
    “如果你和我谈话的目的只是想了解我们的军事秘密，那没有多大意思。”上尉很生气，站起来就想走。
    斯通马上跑过去把上尉拉住，用好言安慰他。最后，斯通决定介绍上尉不久和另一个阴谋分子相见。
    8月5日晚十一时，阿提亚又和斯通会见。这次谈到了钱的问题。斯通一口答应他第二天上午九时去法尔都斯街的某一辆小汽车中取款。又约定8日上午在莫哈吉林街某咖啡馆中相见。斯通还告诉他，如果他那天不能去，就顺延日期。
    8日那天上尉去了，没有碰见斯通。第二天又去了，等了很久，斯通夫人才来。她约定与上尉在11日下午四时再见，以便领他去见早先谈到过的那个阴谋头子。
    到了11日约定的时间，斯通夫人把阿塔亚和他的朋友带到对面街旁停着的一辆汽车那里。斯通已经坐在车上等候。关上车门，斯通带他们先在街上逛了半小时左右，一直到后面没有其他车辆追随时，汽车才在阿布罗马尼街的一座房屋前停下来。
    斯通让上尉的朋友留在车内，却拿走了开车的钥匙。斯通带上尉走入地下室左边那间房里，便出去了。约一分钟以后，门推开了，进来的是一个头戴草帽，留着长胡须的人。要不是上尉眼光好，他简直认不出这人就是叙利亚驻罗马的武官侯赛尼上校。
    侯赛尼热烈地拥抱了上尉以后说：“有人把许多名字告诉我，但我只选中了你。”
    “你是怎样回来的？”上尉觉得很出乎意外。
    “我是拿沙特阿拉伯的护照化装进来的。”
    “有人发现你没有？”
    “一切不必害怕，事情都有准备。”
    屋子里什么人也没有，但武官的声音仍然压得很低：
    “我们这次活动不是廉价的，我们将拿到三亿到四亿美元。”
    在上尉表示愿意接受他的一切命令以后，侯赛尼先在古兰经面前宣誓，然后又让上尉宣誓。宣誓完毕，一个美国人进来告诉侯赛尼说，飞机在等他。侯赛尼点点头，美国人又出去了。侯赛尼继续了解上尉营中的情况，最后又说了这么一段话：
    “我们需要有三个步兵旅和一个反坦克旅。现在除加塔那一地外，其它各地都可保证活动成功。我们将顺利地占领乡村和城市。……”
    约好了暴动的时间和暗号，侯赛尼向上尉告别，匆匆出去。这时，美国大使馆副领事杰顿进来，他请上尉等候一会再走。大约有一个小时之久，杰顿进来告诉上尉：侯赛尼已经坐飞机去罗马。然后他才把上尉送走。在同一天，另一个叙利亚军官也被领到一所美国大使馆职员的住宅内。这位军官进入这所住宅以后，惊奇地发现1954年被赶走的施舍克里正和三个美国女人在一起说笑。看见军官进去，三个女人退走了。
    “我这次是冒着生命危险回来的，不在叙利亚搞出一个名堂来，决不回去。”施舍克里开门见山地向军官说，“我们这次活动的特点就是迅速。你和我们合作，今后前途是很美好的，你应该更多的去联络一些军官，我们将供给你大批金钱。如果你和军官们谈妥，只要告诉我们，就可以动手。……”
    谈完话以后，施舍克里就走了，临行前他还要求军官把活动情况经常和美国人联系。军官被关在屋里约有一个半小时，然后一个美国女人进来放他出去。
    据说侯赛尼武官已于当天乘美国军用飞机抵达罗马，施舍克里也由美国人用使馆汽车偷送到了贝鲁特。……
    但是，金钱收买不了正直军官的良心。和斯通、侯赛尼、施舍克里联系的阿提亚等几个军官，从事情发生的第一天便把情况向有关当局告发了，他们是在叙利亚有关当局指示下和这一批丧尽天良的阴谋分子去周旋的。
    事情发生后，叙利亚政府立即采取了加强治安的措施，逮捕了一些与阴谋案有关的军官。叙利亚政府在8月13日把美国阴谋专家斯通、美国大使馆二等秘书和副领事在二十四小时内驱逐出境。美国还想抵赖这次罪行，但是铁证如山，抵赖也是徒然的。叙利亚各地纷纷举行了群众大会，强烈地抗议美国的阴谋活动。
    独立的代价是高贵的！叙利亚人民经过数百年的艰苦曲折的斗争才换来了今日的独立和自由。军队就是直接保卫他们祖国安全的力量。通过这次阴谋案的揭露，叙利亚人民更加坚决地拥护叙利亚政府所执行的积极中立政策，更加热爱自己的军队。他们一致要求加强团结，提高警惕，以维护叙利亚的神圣的独立。（附图片）
