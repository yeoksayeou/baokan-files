    New Gold Mines Discovered in Shanxi
    Several prospecting teams from the Shanxi Office of the Ministry of Geology have discovered five gold mines in the Lüliang Mountains and Zhongtiao Mountains areas of Shanxi Province. After preliminary exploration, it was found that most of the gold mines at three of the sites are clearly exposed, with only a small portion of the gold-bearing sand hidden deep underground.
    These gold mines are located in Daixian, Pinglu, and Yuanqu counties.
