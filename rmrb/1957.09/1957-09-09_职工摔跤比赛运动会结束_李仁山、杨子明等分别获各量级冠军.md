Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 8th: The eight-day eleven-city and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region workers' wrestling competition concluded in Hohhot today.

Li Renshan, a heavyweight athlete from Tianjin participating in a national wrestling competition for the first time, demonstrated high-level skill in the finals. He defeated Zhou Baomin, a Shanghai athlete with rich wrestling experience, five times in a row to win the heavyweight championship at this event. Yang Ziming (Tianjin) and Ma Qingzong (Hui nationality) (Jinan), who won the national wrestling championships in the light heavyweight and middleweight classes last year, did not encounter stronger opponents in this competition. They won every match in the preliminary and final rounds, and once again won the championships. Shanghai's Liu Dahai, Tianjin's Jia Fucai, and Beijing's Wang Deying (Hui nationality) were undefeated in the finals, winning the championships in the welterweight, lightweight, and featherweight classes, respectively.

The final battle for the flyweight championship today aroused great interest among the audience. The participants were Shanghai's Chen Shaoqiu, Beijing's Qian Deren, and Tianjin's Gao Futong. The three were equal in technique and physical strength, and scored the same in the finals. However, none of them could defeat the others, and all three were ultimately awarded first place. The final for the light flyweight championship was also intense, with the scores being the same. In the end, the conference had to use the method of weighing. Beijing's Hao Zhengcai won the championship because his weight was lighter than Xu Longchang (Shanghai) and Du Xingui (Nanjing).

    职工摔跤比赛运动会结束
    李仁山、杨子明等分别获各量级冠军
    据新华社呼和浩特8日电　历时八天的十一个城市及内蒙古自治区职工摔跤比赛运动会今天在呼和浩特闭幕。
    第一次参加全国性摔跤比赛的天津市重量级选手李仁山，在决赛中表现了高度的技巧，把摔跤有丰富经验的上海市选手周保民，连续摔倒五次，夺得这次会上重量级冠军。去年获得全国摔跤比赛次重量级、中量级冠军的杨子明（天津市）、马清宗（回族）（济南市），在这次比赛时没有遇到比他们更强的对手，预决赛中都一直得胜，再次获得冠军。上海市的选手刘大海、天津市选手贾富财、北京市选手王德英（回族），在决赛中没有败过，分别得到了次中量级、轻量级和次轻量级的冠军。
    今天争夺最轻量级冠军的一场决战，引起观众极大的兴趣。参加比赛的是上海选手陈少秋、北京选手钱德仁和天津市的选手高富桐。他们三人在技术上、体力上都相等，决赛中得分也一样。但他们三人谁也摔不倒谁，最后都被评为第一名。次最轻量级决赛争夺冠军也很激烈，彼此得分也一样，最后大会不得不采用过秤的办法，北京市选手郝正才，因体重比徐隆昌（上海）和杜心贵（南京）轻，获得了冠军。
