    "It's Me"
    There were a few regular customers at a small restaurant. Although their names were unknown, it was known what units they were from and what they did. Among them was an elementary school teacher.
    One night, the teacher came again. The waiter casually inquired, "I heard that a rightist was exposed at your place, named so-and-so. What kind of person is he?"
    Unexpectedly, the old patron blushed and stammered for a long time before replying, "It's me."
    After a minute of silence, a burst of laughter erupted, as if sending the patron off. From then on, the small restaurant lost this old customer!

    “就是我”
    小饭馆有几个老顾客，虽然不知姓名，但是却知道是什么单位和干什么的，其中就有一位小学教师。
    一天夜里，教师又来了。招待员就顺便向他打听：“听说你们那儿出了个右派分子，叫某某，他是个什么样的人？”
    不料这位老主顾面红耳赤，吞吐半天才回答：“就是我。”
    静默了一分钟，随后来了一场哄笑，算是给这位主顾送行。从此，这小馆就失去了这位老主顾！
