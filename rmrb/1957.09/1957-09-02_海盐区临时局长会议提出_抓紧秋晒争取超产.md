The Haiyan District Temporary Bureau Chief Meeting Proposes:
    Seize the Autumn Drying Season and Strive for Overproduction

    (Our report) It is estimated that this year's crude salt production may reach more than 7,565,000 tons, exceeding the state plan by more than 565,000 tons, reaching the 1957 production level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan. This was proposed at the recent Haiyan District Temporary Bureau Chief Meeting held by the Salt Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry.
    In the first half of this year, the Haiyan districts of Liaoning, Hebei, and other provinces achieved bumper harvests. The three salt fields of Liaoning, Hangu, and Tangda, which account for 40% of the country's output, have already completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. However, other Haiyan districts have not completed their production plans due to excessive rainfall. Therefore, to strive to complete the task of producing more than 7,565,000 tons of salt annually, employees of various salt fields still need to make their greatest efforts.
    The abundance or scarcity of salt production is greatly related to weather conditions. According to forecasts from meteorological research departments, rainfall may decrease in the second half of the year, especially in Haiyan areas south of the Huai River, where there may be more opportunities for consecutive sunny days with less rain. In Shandong, the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River, the Yangtze River Delta, Hangzhou Bay, and coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong, rainfall will be less in August and September. Under normal circumstances, in the Haiyan areas north of the Huai River, September and October are precisely the autumn production season. In the salt areas of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and some salt fields in Jiangsu, the second half of the year is also entering a peak production period. If this favorable opportunity is seized and extra effort is made, the aforementioned increased production figures can be achieved.
    Another favorable condition for increasing production by more than 565,000 tons of salt is that basic construction and technical measures from the first half of this year will be put into production one after another, and some private salt fields will also resume production in the second half of the year. This year, the production enthusiasm of salt industry workers in various regions has always been high. Through this rectification campaign and socialist education, the socialist consciousness of the workers will be further enhanced, and they will exert greater production enthusiasm and creativity. Therefore, the comrades attending the Haiyan District Temporary Bureau Chief Meeting in various places have confidence in striving to overfulfill this year's national Haiyan salt production plan.

### 海盐区临时局长会议提出  抓紧秋晒争取超产

    海盐区临时局长会议提出
    抓紧秋晒争取超产
    本报讯  今年原盐的年产量预计可能达到七百五十六万五千多吨，比国家计划多五十六万五千多吨，达到第一个五年计划规定的1957年生产水平。这是食品工业部盐务总局最近召开的海盐区临时局长会议上提出来的。
    今年上半年，辽宁、河北等海盐区获得大丰收，占全国产量40％的辽宁、汉沽、塘大等三个盐场都已经提前完成全年计划。但是其他海盐区由于多雨，没有完成生产计划。因此，要争取完成年产七百五十六万五千多吨盐的任务，各盐场职工还需要尽最大的努力。
    盐的丰收或歉收，和气象条件有很大的关系。根据气象科学研究部门预测，下半年雨量可能减少，特别是淮河以南各海盐地区，连晴少雨的机会可能增多；山东、淮河中下游、长江三角洲、杭州湾和闽粤沿海地区，8、9月份将会少雨。在正常的情况下，淮河以北各盐区，9、10月份正是秋产时期；广东、福建、浙江等几个盐区和江苏部分盐场，下半年也进入旺产时期，如果抓住这个有利时机，加一把劲，上述增产数字是可以达到的。
    增产五十六万五千多吨盐的另一个有利条件，是今年上半年的基本建设、技术措施将陆续投入生产，部分民营盐场也将在下半年恢复生产。今年各地盐业职工的生产情绪始终是饱满的。通过这次整风学习和社会主义教育，职工们的社会主义觉悟将进一步提高，将会发挥更大的生产积极性和创造性。因此，出席海盐区临时局长会议的各地同志，对争取超额完成今年国家海盐生产计划，都有信心。
