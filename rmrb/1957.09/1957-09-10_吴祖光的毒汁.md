	Wu Zuguang's Poison

	Last autumn, when Wu Zuguang came to Kunming to shoot a film, we, the students of Yunnan University, with admiration for him, invited him to give a talk to our Chinese department students.

	He gave us a three-hour speech, introducing us to the life of this rich young master, saying that when he was in high school, he often skipped classes and spent his days wandering around theaters; and he believed that the life during that period was of great help to his later creations. He said that the students were studying Chinese and should go to the theater to learn classical opera; one or two sentences, one or two scenes would create the climax of the play. After listening to his introduction of experience, sure enough, a few students did not study their lessons properly, living a free and undisciplined life, thinking about watching movies and wandering around theaters all day long; feeling that today's college students are not as free as the middle school students of the past, and feeling that they cannot learn the knack of creation from professors, but must go to the theater to learn creative techniques.

	Wu Zuguang also boasted to us about his artistic genius, saying that he wrote "Phoenix City" at the age of nineteen without mastering any drama theory. His "Returning Home on a Snowy Night" has been performed many times. This book is very popular, he said that from Beijing to Kunming, he saw that the shelves of Xinhua bookstores in various places could not find this book, and readers wanted to buy it but could not. He also said that after returning to Beijing, he would not be a film director, but would specialize in creation. It was really a lot of flowery language, very nauseating. Our classmates were deceived by his boasting, and regarded him as a Chinese prodigy, a Chinese genius, and wanted to take him as a model for learning. And they believed that they did not need to master any theory, and could create by virtue of talent. One student regarded his words as a creed. This student was originally very interested in learning modern Chinese, but now he is buried in writing scripts all day long, wanting to become famous in one fell swoop.

	In his speech, Wu Zuguang also slandered Mr. Mei Lanfang's stage art, saying that the several plays he directed for Mr. Mei Lanfang had no people's flavor, let alone the flavor of workers, peasants and soldiers, and were aristocratic things. Wu Zuguang actually slanderously slandered our excellent drama artist in such a vicious way.

	Wu Zuguang is really a poisonous snake, he released poison to our young students. But the great Party gave us antitoxin, so that we could see how sinister and terrible his face was, and how dirty and corrupt his soul was.

### 吴祖光的毒汁

    吴祖光的毒汁
    去年秋天，吴祖光到昆明拍摄电影的时候，我们云南大学的同学怀着对他崇敬的心情，请他对我们中文系的同学讲一次话。
    他给我们作了长达三小时的讲话，向我们介绍了他这个阔公子的生活，说他读高中的时候，常不上课，成天逛戏院；并认为那段时间的生活对他日后的创作有很大的帮助。他说同学们是学中文的，应当多到戏院里去学习古典戏曲；其中的一两句话、一两个场面就造成了戏剧里的高潮。听了他的这段经验介绍，从此，果然有少数同学不好好的钻研功课，生活自由散漫，整天想看电影、逛戏院；觉得今天的大学生不如过去的中学生自由，觉得在教授身上学习不到创作上的窍门，要到戏院里去学习创作技巧了。
    吴祖光还向我们吹捧他的艺术天才，说他十九岁就写了“凤凰城”，并没有掌握什么戏剧理论。他的“风雪夜归人”演出的场数很多。这本书顶畅销，他说从北京到昆明，一路上看到各地新华书店的书架上找不到这本书，读者想购买也买不到。又说他回北京后不搞电影导演了，要专门从事创作。真是天花乱坠，肉麻得很。我们的同学被他的吹捧所迷惑，把他看成中国的神童，中国的奇才，要以他作为学习的榜样。并且相信不需要掌握什么理论，可以凭天才创作。有位同学对他的话奉为信条，这位同学原来对学习现代汉语很感兴趣，现在却成天埋头写剧本，想一举成名。
    吴祖光在讲话中还毁谤梅兰芳先生的舞台艺术，说他导演梅兰芳先生的几部戏没有人民味，工农兵的气味更谈不上，是贵族式的东西。吴祖光竟是这样恶毒地诽谤我国优秀的戏剧艺术家。
    吴祖光真是一条毒蛇，他向我们青年学生放射了毒汁。但伟大的党给了我们抗毒素，使我们看清了他的嘴脸是多么阴险可怕，他的灵魂是多么肮脏腐朽。　　　　云南大学　陈栗
