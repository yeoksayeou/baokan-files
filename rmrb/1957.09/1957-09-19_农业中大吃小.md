    The Big Eat the Small in Agriculture
    According to a report in the American "Worker's Weekly," a congressman recently said at an agricultural gathering in Alabama: "The current trend in agriculture is that small farms are gradually decreasing while large farms are gradually increasing, because small farms cannot withstand the reforms in agricultural technology and competition in the agricultural market." The net profit of farmers in Alabama fell from $300 million in 1951 to $260 million in 1955. Between 1950 and 1954, the number of small farms decreased by 35,000. The number of small farms in 1954 was 31% lower than in 1930.

    农业中大吃小
    据美国“工人周报”报道，最近一位众议员在亚拉巴马州的一次农业集会上说：“现在农业的趋向是小农场逐渐减少而大农场逐渐增大，因小农场经受不了农业技术的改革和农业市场上的竞争”。亚拉巴马州的农民净利从1951年的三亿美元到1955年下降到二亿六千万美元。在1950年至1954年期间，小农场减少了三万五千个。1954年的小农场的数目比1930年下降了31％。
