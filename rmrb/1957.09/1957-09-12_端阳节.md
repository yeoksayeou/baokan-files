　　The Dragon Boat Festival was supposed to be a happy occasion, but the Wang Ers spent the whole day arguing.
　　What were they arguing about? Those who didn't know would be puzzled, but those who did knew very well: it was because they didn't get to eat white flour during the Dragon Boat Festival.
　　Why didn't they even get to eat white flour for the Dragon Boat Festival?
　　"It's because they're poor." Someone who didn't know the details might say that.
　　Actually, it had nothing to do with being rich or poor. Not to mention that Wang Er's family was not one of the poorest in Daliu Village, even those who were struggling had seen great improvements in their lives in recent years, and there was really no one who couldn't afford white flour for festivals.
　　It turned out that Daliu Village was a small town with about a thousand households, divided into eleven streets. After the cancellation of the free grain market and the implementation of unified purchase and sales, the government set up a state-owned grain store here. The grain store had a grain sales system called the "Daily Street Grain Sales System." That is: only residents of one street can buy grain each day, and it rotates every eleven days. Because the staff of the grain store strictly enforced this system, they would not sell you grain on days when it was not your turn, even if you had money. This was the rule.
　　April 20th of the lunar calendar was the turn of Democracy Street, which was Wang Er's street, to buy grain.
　　Wang Er had prepared the money yesterday, planning to buy some coarse grains, and also twenty kilograms of wheat, in preparation for the Dragon Boat Festival. But as luck would have it, his neighbor Bao Hei came to borrow money to treat his father's illness.
　　"What to do? Lend it or not?" Wang Er hesitated.
　　"We can't lend it! How can we not eat wheat during the Dragon Boat Festival?" His wife disagreed.
　　"Treating the illness is more important. We can postpone buying wheat. It will be our turn again on the first day of the fifth month, and buying it then won't delay our eating it." Wang Er explained this to his wife, and decided to lend the money to Bao Hei. Bao Hei promised to return it on the first day of the month.
　　Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was the first day of the fifth month. Wang Er wanted to buy wheat for the festival, but Bao Hei didn't have the money to return. Although he returned it on the second day, it was already too late. This delayed Wang Er's wheat for the festival.
　　To be honest, Wang Er and his wife wouldn't have quarreled if it weren't for their daughter-in-law; it was because they had a daughter-in-law, and it was her first Dragon Boat Festival since joining the family, and their son was not at home. If they didn't eat dumplings, the wife would feel uncomfortable. If she felt uncomfortable, what could she do? She knew it was Bao Hei's fault, but she couldn't openly blame Bao Hei, so she had to vent her hidden resentment towards Bao Hei on her husband.
　　In the evening, Wang Er only ate one bowl of rice and went to a meeting in town.
　　The daughter-in-law woke up in the middle of the night and heard her in-laws arguing again. She thought it was still about the daytime incident. She only heard, "The higher-ups only talk the talk and don't walk the walk. I don't believe it!" It was the mother-in-law's angry voice.
　　"If you don't believe it, then don't believe it. Why argue?" The father-in-law's voice was very small, and the mother-in-law didn't say anything more.
　　"'The higher-ups only talk the talk and don't walk the walk?' What's that about?" The daughter-in-law didn't understand what her in-laws were arguing about. But the tone of the conversation was unrelated to the daytime incident. So the daughter-in-law went back to sleep peacefully.
　　During breakfast the next morning, the daughter-in-law asked her father-in-law, "Dad, what kind of meeting did you have last night?"
　　"From now on, we don't have to buy grain according to the day anymore. Your dad gave an opinion to the county magistrate!" The mother-in-law said, winking directly at her daughter-in-law.
　　The daughter-in-law understood what her mother-in-law meant and asked her father-in-law with a smile, "Dad, is that true?!"
　　"Last night, there was a meeting of residents' representatives. County Magistrate Wang asked the residents if they had any opinions on the government. I suggested that the grain sales system was too rigid. The county magistrate promised to change it immediately. The county magistrate keeps his word." The father-in-law's last words were obviously directed at the mother-in-law.
　　The mother-in-law secretly winked at her daughter-in-law and teased, "Your dad gave an opinion to the county magistrate today, and tomorrow he can give an opinion to Chairman Mao."
　　"As long as there is a correct opinion, it's the same to give it to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao welcomes it. Besides, giving it to the county magistrate is the same as giving it to Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao will know."
　　The daughter-in-law said with a smile, "Mom, what kind of society was it in the past, and what kind of society is it now? Now the people are the masters of the country, so of course the people's words are effective."
　　"Your mom doesn't know anything. All she knows is to eat her fill and not be hungry, and sleep enough and not be sleepy." The father-in-law said, grabbed a sack, and walked out. "Other people celebrate the fifth day of the fifth month, we'll celebrate the sixth."
　　The father-in-law was gone for less than the time it takes to eat a meal, and came back with half a sack of grain. The daughter-in-law happily shouted, "Mom! My dad really bought grain back."
　　"Can it be fake?" The father-in-law's face was full of smiles.
　　"I don't believe it." Although the mother-in-law said she didn't believe it, she got off the bed.
　　"If you don't believe it, why are you getting down?" The father-in-law said, glancing at the mother-in-law, and the mother-in-law smiled. The whole family laughed.

### 端阳节

　　端阳节
　　孙明尹
    好好的端阳节，王二老两口子却打了一天嘴仗。
    他们为了啥事呢？不知道的当然纳闷，知道的很明白：原来是因为过端阳节没吃上白面。
    为啥过端阳节连白面都没吃上呢？
    “还不是日子穷。”不知道底细的人很可能这样嚷嚷。
    其实，这跟穷富倒是没有关系的。且不说王二的日子在大刘集上还不是拉脚户，就说那些拉脚户，这几年生活也大大的改善了，逢年过节吃不上白面的还真没有呢。
    原来这大刘集，是个小镇子，全镇一千来户人家，共分成十一条街道居住。自从粮食自由市场取消、实行统购统销以后，政府在这里设立了一个国营粮店，这个粮店有项售粮制度，叫作“日街售粮制”。就是：每日只有一条街道的居民可以买到粮，每十一天轮到一天。因为粮店工作人员对这项制度执行的过死，因此轮不到你买粮的日子，你有钱也不卖给你。这是制度。
    夏历四月二十日轮到民主街买粮，也就是王二这条街道。
    王二昨天就把钱准备好了，计划是这样：除了买几十斤粗粮以外，还买二十斤小麦。准备过端阳节。可是事有凑巧，隔壁保黑来借钱给父亲治病。
    “怎么办呢？借给还是不借给？”王二犹豫不决。
    “不能借呀，咱端阳节还能不吃麦子吗。”老婆不同意。
    “还是治病要紧，买麦子向后推一推，五月初一还能轮到一回，那时候买也耽误不了吃。”王二向老婆讲出这个道理，决定把钱借给保黑。保黑满口答应初一日一定还给。
    日子过的飞快，转眼之间到了五月初一，王二要买麦子过节了，保黑却没钱还给。虽然初二还了，但是已经晚了。就这样把王二过节的麦子耽误了。
    说实在话，王二要不是有儿媳妇，两口子也不能吵嘴；只因为有儿媳妇，且是过门来第一个端阳节，儿子又不在家，不吃顿饺子，老婆总觉得不舒服。不舒服又怎么办呢？明知是保黑不对，可也不能明里埋怨保黑，就只好把暗里对保黑的埋怨，明里对老头子发泄。
    晚上王二只吃了一碗饭，就到镇上开会去了。
    媳妇半夜醒来，听见公婆又在吵嘴，自以为还是为白天的事，只听：“上级净说理不作理，我才不信哩！”是婆婆带气的声音。
    “不信就不信吧，何必吵吵的。”公公的声音很小，婆婆也不言语了。
    “‘上级说理不作理？……’是啥事呀？”媳妇不解公婆又为啥事。但听话味，可与白天的事无关。媳妇也就安心的睡了。
    第二天早饭中间，媳妇问公公道：“爹，昨天晚上开的啥会？”
    “以后买粮不用按日子啦，你爹给县长提意见哩！”婆婆说着，直向媳妇眨眼睛。
    媳妇领会了婆婆的意思，笑着问公公道：“爹，是真的吗？！”
    “昨天晚上开居民代表会，王县长征求居民对政府有啥意见，我提出了卖粮制度太死。县长答应马上改变。人家县长说话还能不给话作主。”公公最后的话，显然是冲着婆婆说的。
    婆婆偷偷的向媳妇眨眨眼睛，取笑道：“你爹今个给县长提意见，明日就能给毛主席提意见了。”
    “但看有没有正确的意见，要有正确意见，给毛主席还不是一样提，毛主席可欢迎呢。再说，给县长提还不是和给毛主席提了一样，毛主席也能知道。”
    媳妇笑着说：“娘，过去是啥社会，现在是啥社会。现在是人民当家作主，当然人民说话就好使。”
    “你娘知道啥，就知道吃饱不饿，睡够不睏。”公公说着找了条口袋挟着就往外走，“人家过五月五咱过五月六。” 
    公公去了不到吃顿饭的工夫，背着半口袋粮回来了。媳妇高兴的喊起来：“娘！俺爹真买粮回来了。”
    “这还能假了。”公公脸上堆着笑容。
    “我才不信呢。”婆婆虽说不信，却从炕上走了下来。
    “不信下来干啥。”公公说着瞟了婆婆一眼，婆婆笑了。一家人都笑了。
