　　Czechoslovakia Arrests American Spy
　　He Attempted to Cross the Border into Hungary for Contact
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 19th: Czechoslovakia recently arrested Josef Wiesen, an agent who had been working for American intelligence agencies for many years. This spy attempted to sneak across the Czechoslovak border into Hungary, his mission being to contact spies of the American intelligence agency in Hungary and to reactivate them once again during the special session of the United Nations General Assembly to debate the so-called "Hungarian Question." Wiesen was originally a Czechoslovak citizen and had been engaged in espionage work even before the liberation. In 1956, under the direction of American spies, he participated in the preparation and execution of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary events.
