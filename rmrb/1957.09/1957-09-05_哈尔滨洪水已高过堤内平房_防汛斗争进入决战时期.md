Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th: At 5:00 PM today, the water level of the Songhua River in Harbin reached 120.20 meters, exceeding last year's highest flood level by 14 centimeters. Currently, the floodwaters have risen above the roofs of the houses inside the dyke, and the water level continues to rise.

At the time of the peak flood, influenced by a low-pressure system coming from the Mongolian People's Republic, Harbin will experience strong winds of level seven to eight and moderate rain within thirty-six hours. Therefore, Harbin's flood control struggle is facing a critical juncture.

Today, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting. After analyzing the flood situation in Harbin, the committee pointed out that Harbin's flood control struggle has reached a decisive phase. Although the flood is very turbulent and continues to rise, we have the determination and confidence to achieve victory. The meeting requested Harbin City to do a good job of "four preventions": preventing wind and waves, preventing emergencies, preventing sabotage, and preventing negligence.

    哈尔滨洪水已高过堤内平房
    防汛斗争进入决战时期
    据新华社哈尔滨4日电　今天下午五时，哈尔滨江面水位已上涨到一二○·二○公尺，超过去年最高洪水水位达十四公分。目前江面的洪水已高过堤内平房的屋顶，洪水还在上涨中。
    正当最高洪峰来临的时候，受蒙古人民共和国方面来的低气压影响，哈尔滨在三十六小时内将有七到八级大风和中雨。因此，哈尔滨防洪斗争正面临着紧要关头。
    今天，中共黑龙江省委召开了紧急会议，分析哈尔滨水情后指出，哈尔滨防汛斗争已到决战时期，洪水虽然很汹涌，并且不断地上涨，但我们有决心有信心取得胜利。会议要求哈尔滨市作好防风浪、防险情、防破坏和防疏忽大意的四防工作。
