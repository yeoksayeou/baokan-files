Refuting Chen Tiqiang's Fallacies on International Law
Zhu Liru

I am a layman in international law, but I cannot agree with the first sentence of Chen Tiqiang's speech at the symposium of the legal community. Chen Tiqiang said, "International law has always been very weak in China in the past, so it only knew how to kowtow to foreigners." It is unreasonable to blame the past kowtow diplomacy of China on the weakness of knowledge of international law. Chen Tiqiang and his superiors, Wang Shijie and Wang Huarong, should have had considerable knowledge of international law, but wasn't the Sino-American commercial treaty they handled still kowtowing to the Americans? Therefore, China's past kowtow diplomacy was not due to China's weak international law, but there are other deeper reasons. Without studying and understanding these profound reasons, and simply saying that weak knowledge of international law will lead to kowtow diplomacy is untenable. His purpose is only to elevate himself.

Chen Tiqiang said that capitalist countries have a set of international law, and socialist countries have a set of international law. He is denying in fact and in theory that there is a common international law in this world that applies to all countries and is binding on all countries. I believe that there are many international legal norms that are recognized, basic, and common, and are equally recognized and binding on both bourgeois and proletarian countries: for example, respect for national sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, equality between large and small countries, inviolability of national territory; various war regulations (Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, Convention Prohibiting the Use of Poison Gas, etc.), and certain systems and conventions in diplomacy, etc. This is one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, there is the question of "whether to interpret the principles of international law with proletarian thought, or with the thought of the monopoly bourgeoisie." There is a fundamental difference between the two. For example, on the issue of respecting national sovereignty, scholars of international law in capitalist countries often believe that only white countries can enjoy sovereignty. They even argue that the sovereignty of white countries is absolute, not subject to any restrictions, or even to any obligation to "respect the legitimate interests of other countries," and thus arbitrarily interfere in the sovereignty of other countries—especially backward countries. Furthermore, many bourgeois jurists argue that trusteeships over oriental colonies or other places must develop to a certain standard and extent prescribed by them before they can be approved as sovereign states. What is this? Is it that only Western nations can have sovereignty, and Eastern nations should not have sovereignty? Our socialist countries are not like this. We believe that the sovereignty of all countries should be respected. We respect the countries of all people, whether white, black, or yellow, large or small. On this issue, it can be clearly seen that there are fundamental differences in ideological standpoints and understanding of issues between Western bourgeois international law scholars and socialist international law scholars. In fact, Western international law scholars and socialist international law scholars have similarly natured differences on many other international law issues.

The question now is, should we follow the theories of Western bourgeois international law scholars, or should we follow the theories of international law scholars in our socialist countries? If we follow the former, we will bully backward countries and colonial people. This is something we cannot do.

As everyone knows, international jurists in capitalist countries have never regarded China as a subject of international law. They said that international law does not apply to China and other Asian countries because we are barbarians. For example, until a few weeks ago, Dulles was still saying that China had not proven itself to meet the standards of so-called civilized countries and therefore could not enter the United Nations. Under such circumstances, when people do not regard China as human beings, how can Chen Tiqiang still ask us to learn Anglo-American international law? How can this work? How can we follow Western international law scholars?

Chen Tiqiang said that old international law scholars in China are almost finished. This is unfounded nonsense. Isn't Chen Tiqiang himself the best proof? Have the Party and the leaders of the Diplomatic Association and the Institute of International Relations mistreated him in any way? No. Have we mistreated Wang Tieya? No, we haven't. Which of the old international law scholars is unemployed or without a way out now? None.

As for whether old international law scholars should reform themselves, of course they should, and they should thoroughly reform themselves.

I believe that there are two extremely serious problems with our old intellectuals who have studied in Europe and America. These two problems are:

(1) Worshiping Europe and America: They always think that in terms of scholarship, the Soviet Union is not good, and China is even worse. Only Europe and America are the best. Publishing papers in academic journals of socialist countries is not considered international status, but publishing papers in academic journals of capitalist countries is considered to have so-called international status. This kind of shameful and pathetic worship of Europe and America has not been resolved by some people in our country's great three major movements. For those who have studied in Britain and the United States, it is necessary to resolutely and quickly clarify this kind of thinking today. Otherwise, they will be captives of Anglo-American reactionary theories for the rest of their lives, they will never escape the academic traps they have laid out, they will never see the overall situation clearly, they will not understand the great righteousness, they will not be able to sever the myriad of ties with imperialism, and they will not be able to achieve true independent thinking. How dangerous this is for the individual and for the country.

(2) Legalism: International law is one of the tools for solving international problems. If this tool is useful to our country, to the cause of socialism, and to the cause of peace for the people of the world, we will use it; if this tool is not beneficial to our country, to the cause of socialism, and to the cause of peace for the people of the world, then we cannot use it, and we should create new tools to replace it. Most of our old international law scholars today have a legalistic viewpoint, binding themselves in certain small frameworks of international law and allowing the imperialists to slaughter them.

They say that eliminating imperialist privileges conflicts with international law. When we want to resist American aggression, they say that this is not in accordance with international law. Many Anglo-American international law scholars do not recognize that international law norms apply to China, but we insist on imposing the reactionary principles of international law that are unilaterally beneficial to Britain and the United States on ourselves. Isn't this extremely absurd?

The self-reform of our old international law scholars must be carried out thoroughly and practically. First, these two major problems must be removed, our thinking must be corrected, and our socialist stand must be firmly established. Then, the work we do can conform to the interests of our country and the people of the world.

Chen Tiqiang said, "China's international law science is in crisis." I was shocked when I saw this. What crisis do we have? I don't see any. On the contrary, we not only have no crisis, but we have already made and are making new contributions to the world's international law science. The positions and actions taken by the Soviet Union and us on many international issues have further improved and developed the world's international law science and made it richer. For forty years, the Soviet Union has firmly defended and developed the above-mentioned basic principles of international law; created new international law theories and practices for new types of relations between socialist countries; embodied the good will of the masses of people to oppose war, demand peace, and promote friendship among people of all countries; helped the formation of democratic principles in international law and consolidated the progressive significance of international law. This is exactly what every international law scholar of ours must humbly learn from. Here is a treasure house, in which is stored endless things that are very precious to the science of international law. Why can't our international law scholars see it, and insist that the Soviet Union has little to learn from, and insist on learning the set of the bourgeoisie?

Although our new China has only been established for eight years, we have also made many contributions to international law. We have justly defended the basic principles of international law of national equality, non-interference in internal affairs, and maintenance of world peace; realized the will of the people of all countries to yearn for peaceful coexistence; the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (followed by the Asian-African Conference Declaration) collectively embody the most basic nine principles of international law and international relations, and unite peace-loving countries; provided a model for semi-colonial countries to stand up and eliminate imperialist privileges.

We have done so many very important things in the past few years and provided so much important material to the science of international law. If our international law scholars can study, promote, and refine these things and develop them theoretically, they will definitely make valuable contributions to the world's international law science. In this way, what crisis can China's international law scholars speak of? If our international law scholars work hard in these areas, they will surely be respected by the people.

Chen Tiqiang does not consider the problem from these aspects, but insists that our international law science has already experienced a crisis; saying that Chinese international law scholars have no way out, this is lying with his eyes closed.

　　驳陈体强关于国际法的谬论
　　朱力如
    我对国际法是外行，但我看了陈体强在法学界座谈会上的发言的第一句话就不能同意。陈体强说，“国际法，过去在中国一向是很薄弱的，所以只会向外国人磕头”。把过去中国的磕头外交归罪于国际法知识的薄弱，这是没有道理的，陈体强和他的上司王世杰、王化成的国际法知识总算不薄弱了吧，但他所经手签订的中美商约还不是在对美国人磕头？所以中国过去的磕头外交并不是由于中国的国际法弱，而是另有更深刻的原因的。不去研究、认识这些深刻的原因，而笼统说一句，国际法知识薄弱会导致磕头外交，这是站不住脚的。他的目的只是在于抬高自己而已。
    陈体强说资本主义国家有一套国际法，社会主义国家有一套国际法，他这是在事实上和理论上否认这个世界上有一种对所有国家都适用、都有拘束力的共同的国际法。我认为，有不少的国际法规范，是公认的，基本的，共同的，不论对资产阶级国家或无产阶级国家都是同样承认，同样有拘束力的：例如，关于国家主权的应被尊重，各国内政不能干涉，大、小国家一律平等，各国领土不受侵犯；各种战争法规（日内瓦战俘公约，不许使用毒气公约等等），以及外交上某些制度和惯例等等。这是问题的一方面。在问题的另一方面，存在着“是用无产阶级思想来解释国际法原则呢？还是用垄断资产阶级思想来解释国际法”的问题。这两者有着根本的区别。例如关于尊重国家主权问题，资本主义国家的国际法学者每每认为，只有白种人国家才能享受主权，他们甚至主张白种人国家的主权是绝对的，不受任何限制的，甚至不受“尊重其他国家合法利益”的任何义务所拘束，因而任意干涉他国——尤其是落后国家——的主权。又如，许多资产阶级法学家主张被托管的东方殖民地或其他地方要发展到他们所规定的某种标准和程度，才能被批准作为有主权国家。这是什么话呢？难道就是西方民族才可以有主权，而东方民族就不应该有主权？我们社会主义国家就不是这样，我们认为对一切国家的主权都应该尊重。我们无论对什么人的国家——白种人的、黑种人的、黄种人的大国、小国——都加尊重。在这个问题上，可以明白看出西方资产阶级国际法学者和社会主义国际法学者在思想立场、理解问题等方面的根本分歧。事实上，西方国际法学者和社会主义国际法学者在其他许多国际法问题上都是存在着同样性质的分歧的。
    现在问题是，跟西方资产阶级国际法学者的学说走呢？还是跟我们社会主义国家国际法学者的学说走？如果跟前者的学说走，那么就要欺负落后国家欺负殖民地人民。这是我们所不能做的。
    大家知道，资本主义国家的国际法学家过去从来不曾把我们中国作为国际法的主体来看待。他们说国际法不适用于我们中国和其他亚洲国家，因为我们是野蛮的。例如，一直到前几星期，杜勒斯还说我们中国没有证明自己符合于所谓文明国的标准，因而不能进入联合国。在这样的情况下，人家已经不把我们中国当人了，陈体强还要我们学英美的国际法，这怎能行呢？跟西方的国际法学者走，这怎能行呢？
    陈体强说，在中国的旧国际法学者几乎完蛋了，这是没有根据的胡说。陈体强本身不就是一个最好的证明么？党和外交学会，国际关系研究所的领导那一点亏待了他？没有。我们对王铁崖错待了没有？也没有。旧的国际法学者谁现在是失业的，或没有出路的呢？也没有。
    至于旧国际法学者是不是应该自我改造呢？当然应该，而且要彻底改造才行。
    我认为，我们留学过欧美的旧知识分子，有两个问题极其严重。这两个问题是：
    （一）崇拜欧美：总是认为从学问上讲，苏联不行，中国更不行，只有欧美是最好的；论文发表在社会主义国家的学术杂志上，这不是什么国际地位，论文发表在资本主义国家的学术杂志上，那才算有了所谓国际地位。这种很可耻，也很可怜的崇拜欧美的思想，有些人在我国的伟大的三大运动中并没有解决。对留学过英美的人来说，今天必须坚决地、赶快地澄清这种思想。不然的话，就一辈子要做英美反动学说的俘虏，一辈子逃不出他们所布置的学术圈套，一辈子看不清大局，懂不得大义，割不断和帝国主义的千丝万缕的关系，做不到真正的独立思考。这对个人，对国家来说都多么危险啊。
      （二）唯法观点：国际法是解决国际问题的工具之一。这种工具如果对我们国家、对社会主义事业，对全世界人民的和平事业有用，我们就用它；这种工具如果对我们本国不利，对社会主义事业和对世界人民的和平事业也不利，那我们就不能用它，就应该创造新的工具来代替它。我们今天的许多旧国际法学者大多数有一种唯法观点，把自己束缚在某些国际法的小框框里，听凭帝国主义宰割。
    肃清帝国主义特权，他们说这与国际法抵触。我们要抵抗美帝侵略，他们又说这与国际法不合。许多英美国际法学者不承认国际法规范运用于中国，而我们偏偏要自己把对于英美片面有利的国际法反动原则套在自己头上。这岂不是荒谬已极吗？
    我们旧国际法学者的自我改造，必须彻底切实地进行，首先把这两大问题去掉，端正思想，站稳社会主义的立场，然后做出来的工作才能符合本国的和世界人民的利益。
    陈体强说，“中国的国际法科学有危机。”我看了以后大吃一惊。我们究竟有什么危机呢？我看没有。相反地，我们不但没有危机，而且对世界国际法科学已经作出了和正在作出着新的贡献。苏联和我们在许多国际问题上所采取的立场和行动使世界国际法科学更加提高，更加发展，更丰富了世界的国际法科学。苏联四十年来坚定地捍卫了并且发展了上面所说的那些国际法的基本原则；创立了社会主义国家间新型关系的新国际法理论和实践；体现了人民大众反对战争、要求和平和各国人民友好相处的善良意志；帮助了国际法上民主原则的形成和巩固了国际法的进步意义。这正是我们每个国际法学者必须虚心向之学习的。这里是一个宝库，其中贮藏着无穷的对国际法科学十分珍贵的东西，为什么我们的国际法学者看不见，硬说苏联没有多少东西可学，硬要去学资产阶级的一套呢？
    我们新中国建国虽只八年，但我们也对国际法作了不少的贡献。我们正义地捍卫了民族平等、不许干涉他国内政、维护世界和平的国际法基本原则；实现了各国人民热烈向往和平共处的意志；和平共处五项原则（继之的亚非会议宣言）集中地体现了国际法和国际关系的最基本的九项原则，并把爱好和平的国家团结起来；提供了半殖民地国家站起来后肃清帝国主义特权的范例。
    我们这几年来做了这么多十分重要的事情，对国际法科学提供了这么多的重要材料，如果我们的国际法学者能够把这些东西加以研究、发扬、提炼，从理论上把它发展起来，那就一定会对世界国际法科学作出很宝贵的贡献。这样看，中国的国际法学者有什么危机可言呢？我们的国际法学者如果努力从这些方面来工作，是一定会得到人民的尊重的。
    陈体强不从这些方面去考虑问题，硬说我们今天国际法科学已经发生了危机；说中国国际法学者没有出路，这是闭着眼睛说谎。
