Birds of a Feather

Ye Qifang's Absurd Arguments Praised by Zhang Naiqi

This newspaper reports: On September 10th, professors from the Chinese Department of Zhongshan University exposed rightist element Ye Qifang, who calls himself a "long-range cannon."

Ye Qifang is a professor in the Chinese Department of Zhongshan University, concurrently serving as the library director, vice chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, a representative of the Guangzhou People's Congress, and a member of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPPCC. During the "blooming" and "contending" period, he lit fires and spread poison everywhere, attacking the Party. On May 18th, the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League held a symposium for League members in primary and secondary schools. Ye Qifang presided over the meeting, saying, "The situation in Guangzhou is not as heated as in Shanghai, so we must start fires. Now we are lighting the first fire within the League. You must take the seeds of fire back to your original units and let them all burn and boil (i.e., seethe)."

As early as December of last year, Ye Qifang began spreading poison. At the first session of the Second Guangzhou Municipal People's Congress, he said, "The discrimination against intellectuals by public security organs is even more embarrassing." He described the unemployment of intellectuals, a problem left over from the old society that has not yet been fully resolved, as a result of the Party's discrimination. After this speech was published, it was highly praised by right-wing ringleaders. On December 8th, Zhang Naiqi personally visited him, but he was not at home. Zhang left a note saying, "Your speech at the Municipal People's Congress was very good. We will pay great attention to it. Please continue to reflect these situations in the future."

　　臭味相投
    叶启芳谬论受到章乃器赞赏
    本报讯　9月10日，中山大学中文系教授揭露自称是“远程大炮”的右派分子叶启芳。
    叶启芳是中山大学中文系教授兼图书馆馆长、民盟广州市委员会副主任委员、广州市人民代表、政协广州市委员会委员。在“鸣”、“放”期间，他到处点火放毒，向党进攻。5月18日，民盟市委召开中、小学盟员座谈会，叶启芳主持会议，他说：“广州情况不及上海那样热，因此我们要放火，现在是在盟内放第一把火，你们要把火种带回原单位去，让各处都烧得发滚（即沸腾）起来。”
    还在去年12月的时候，叶启芳就开始放毒了，他在广州市第二届人代会第一次会议上说：“公安机关对知识分子的歧视更令人难堪”，他把旧社会遗留下来的现在仍未能全部解决的社会知识分子失业现象说成是党歧视的结果。这个发言发表后，很受右派头目的赞赏。章乃器在12月8日亲自上门拜访他，他不在家，章留下条子说：“您在市人大的发言甚好，我等将给以极大的注意，以后请多反映这些情况。”
