Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 7th: Over three hundred senior intellectuals and social figures in Shanghai received a profound socialist education at a forum held by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

The forum, held concurrently with the Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, lasted for twenty days, from August 16th to September 5th.

At the forum, scientists, artists, professors, and doctors presented a large number of facts they had personally done, seen, and heard, shattering the reactionary arguments of the rightists Wang Hengshou, Jiang Qingxiang, Yang Yinpu, Chen Zizhan, and Pan Xulun. The meeting also systematically exposed and criticized the ugly faces of Sun Siming, a confidant of Luo Longji, and another rightist, Xue Yinghui.

An important characteristic of this forum was that it not only treated the rightists as targets of reasoned struggle, but also truly treated them as teachers by negative example to educate themselves. For each rightist, the meeting summarized several key issues related to the struggle between the two roads from their reactionary words and deeds, presented facts and reasoned, and gradually launched an in-depth debate. During the debate, rightists were allowed to defend themselves at any time and freely express their opinions. In this way, the more the questions were debated, the deeper they became, the clearer the truth became, and the higher everyone's enthusiasm for the struggle became. Wu Feidan and Chen Chuanzhang, professors at Fudan University, said: After listening to the rightist Wang Hengshou's self-criticism of his anti-communist words and deeds, they thought of the "Do not discuss state affairs" signs that were posted in teahouses and restaurants before liberation. If Wang Hengshou had said as many hostile things to the Kuomintang government as he did now, he would have been arrested or even killed long ago. Today, Wang Hengshou has spoken countless anti-communist remarks, and we are still presenting facts and reasoning with him, which cannot but demonstrate the superiority of our democratic system. Li Jinhui, a sixty-seven-year-old musician, compared participating in this struggle to reading a book for a year. He said that he did not pay enough attention to politics in the past, and that he would improve his political sense in the future. Famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor Shi Xiaoshan, opera actors Fu Quanxiang, Wang Wenjuan, and Shi Xiaoying, and others expressed their determination to strengthen political and ideological training, stand firm, and not ignore politics. Li Ruifu, a mathematics professor at East China Normal University, also said that one cannot leave politics, saying, "I may not ask about politics, but politics will ask about me."

Before launching a reasoned struggle with the rightists, the members and attendees of the forum together enthusiastically discussed the nature of the anti-rightist struggle, the boundaries between middle-of-the-roaders and rightists, and the relationship between the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification campaign. They criticized and clarified many erroneous ideas such as the "middle road," "not asking about politics," and "speaking too much is liable to error," greatly enhancing their enthusiasm for participating in the struggle.

### 右派分子既是斗争对象又是反面教师  上海三百多高级知识分子受到深刻教育

    右派分子既是斗争对象又是反面教师
    上海三百多高级知识分子受到深刻教育
    新华社上海7日电　上海市三百多位高级知识分子和社会人士，在政协上海市委员会举行的座谈会上受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    这次座谈会是和上海市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议同时召开的，从8月16日到9月5日举行了二十天。
    座谈会上，科学家、艺术家、教授、医师们在会上摆出大量亲手所做、亲眼所见、亲耳所闻的事实，粉碎了右派分子王恒守、姜庆湘、杨荫溥、陈子展和潘序伦的反动言论。会上还系统地揭露和批判了罗隆基的亲信孙斯鸣和另一个右派分子薛映辉的丑恶面目。
    这次座谈会的重要特点，是既把右派分子当做说理斗争的对象，又真正做到了把右派分子作为反面教师来教育自己。会上对每一个右派分子，都从他的反动言行中归纳出几个有关两条道路斗争的主要问题，一个个地摆事实、讲道理，逐步深入地展开大辩论。辩论中允许右派分子随时申辩，自由发表他们的意见。这样，就使问题愈辩愈深，真理愈辩愈明，大家的斗争热情也愈来愈高。复旦大学教授吴斐丹、陈传璋都说：听了右派分子王恒守关于反共言行的检查，想到解放以前茶馆、酒楼都贴着“莫谈国事”的字条。假使王恒守那时对国民党政府说了像现在这样多的敌对的话，他早已被捕甚至杀头了。今天王恒守讲了举不胜举的反共言论，我们都还同他摆事实、说道理，这不能不说明我们民主制度的优越性。六十七岁的老音乐家黎锦辉把参加这次斗争比作胜读一年书。他说他过去关心政治不够，以后要提高政治嗅觉。著名的中医石筱山，戏曲演员傅全香、王文娟和石筱英等人表示一定要加强政治思想锻炼，站稳立场，不能不问政治。华东师范大学数学教授李锐夫也表示一个人不能离开政治，他说：“我不问政治，政治要问我的。”
    这次座谈会在同右派分子展开说理斗争之前，出席的委员和列席人员一起热烈地讨论了反右派斗争的性质、中间分子与右派分子的界限、反右派斗争和整风的关系等问题，批判和澄清了“中间路线”、“不问政治”、“言多必失”等许多错误思想，大大提高了他们参加斗争的积极性。
