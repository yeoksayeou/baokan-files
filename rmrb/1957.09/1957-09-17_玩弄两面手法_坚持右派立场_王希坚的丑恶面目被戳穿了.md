Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 16th: The Party Group of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles (文联) recently held a series of expanded meetings to conduct a reasoned struggle against the rightist Wang Xijian within the Party.

Wang Xijian is the acting vice-chairman and Party group member of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In past political movements and daily work, he has consistently adhered to a rightist stance, playing double-faced tricks, and resisting the Party's instructions and leadership. During the "blooming and contending" period, Wang Xijian said in his published article "Hope": "Everywhere people are talking about shortcomings and exposing mistakes...making people excited and encouraged." He also slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, called for "injustice" for counter-revolutionaries, and incited those targeted in the suppression to attack the Party. In 1955, when criticizing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the internal publication of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles "Creation and Learning" (创作与学习), which was under Wang Xijian's control, not only failed to organize articles criticizing Hu Feng, but instead published an article by the counter-revolutionary Chen Zhenglu promoting Hu Feng's "theories." Wang Xijian also supported this article in the "Editor's Note." After the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee criticized this, Wang Xijian made a self-criticism, admitting his mistakes and expressing his willingness to correct them. However, in this "blooming and contending" period, Wang Xijian even attempted to overturn the verdict and shout "injustice" for Chen Zhenglu. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, when the leading group of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles wanted to investigate a historical counter-revolutionary element with current reactionary remarks, Wang Xijian's attitude was extremely passive, expressing disagreement and even attacking activists in the suppression. Therefore, he was criticized by the higher-level leading group. However, not only did he refuse to accept it, but he also slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as an "evil wind" and wrote a counter-poem: "Sitting alone in the small building, my heart is as ashes, for whom is my unwavering loyalty? When the typhoon blows over, I will tell you in detail what is right and wrong."

Wang Xijian has consistently opposed the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work, disagreeing that the Federation of Literary and Art Circles should be responsible to the Party and to mass creation. He believes that the Federation of Literary and Art Circles "is just a small group composed of professional writers." He completely denied the necessity of conducting ideological struggles among literary and art workers, saying, "So-called criticism is actually exclusion!" He repeatedly slandered the Shandong Provincial Party Committee as "dogmatic," "vulgar sociology occupies a dominant position in the Provincial Party Committee," and said, "This is the most ferocious enemy in the current literary and art circles," attempting to incite the entire literary and art circles to attack the Provincial Party Committee.

After the anti-rightist struggle began, when the Provincial Party Committee wanted the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to launch an anti-rightist struggle, Wang Xijian openly resisted, arrogantly saying: "If you, the Provincial Party Committee, want rightists from me, I can manufacture twenty for you in a week!" And he tried his best to spread the idea that there were no rightists in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Wang Xijian also obstructed the Shandong People's Publishing House's struggle against the rightist Wang Fuhui.

### 玩弄两面手法  坚持右派立场  王希坚的丑恶面目被戳穿了

　　玩弄两面手法  坚持右派立场
　　王希坚的丑恶面目被戳穿了
    据新华社济南16日电　中共山东省文联党组最近连续举行扩大会议，对党内右派分子王希坚展开说理斗争。
    王希坚是山东省文联代理副主席、党组委员，他在历次政治运动和日常工作中，一贯坚持右派立场，玩弄两面手法，对抗党的指示和领导。在鸣放期间，王希坚在他发表的“希望”一文中说：“到处都在谈论缺点，揭露错误……使人兴奋，使人鼓舞。”他还诬蔑肃反运动，替反革命分子呼“冤”，煽动肃反对象向党进攻。1955年，批判胡风反革命集团时，王希坚所主持的文联内部刊物“创作与学习”不但没有组织文章批判胡风，反而发表了反革命分子陈正鲁宣扬胡风“理论”的文章，王希坚并在“编后记”里支持了这篇文章。后经中共山东省委宣传部提出批评，王希坚作了检讨，承认自己的错误，并表示愿意改正。但在这次“鸣放”中，王希坚竟企图翻案，并替陈正鲁喊“冤”。肃反运动中，文联领导小组要审查一个有现行反动言论的历史反革命分子，王希坚态度极为消极，表示不同意，甚至攻击肃反积极分子。因此，他曾受到上级领导小组的批评。但是，他不但不肯接受，反而诬蔑肃反运动是“歪风”，并写了一首反诗：“小楼枯坐意如灰，耿耿忠心却为谁，待等台风吹过后，为君细述是与非。”
    王希坚一贯反对党对文艺工作的领导，不同意文联应该对党负责、对群众创作负责。他认为文联“只是一些专业作家组成的小团体”。他完全否定在文艺工作者当中进行思想斗争的必要性，他说“所谓批评，实际上就是排挤！”他一再诬蔑中共山东省委是“教条主义”，“庸俗社会学在省委占统治地位”，并且说“这就是当前文艺界最凶狠的敌人”，企图以此来煽动整个文艺界向省委进攻。
    反右派斗争开始后，当省委要文联开展反右派斗争时，王希坚公然加以抗拒，他嚣张地说：“你们省委如果向我要右派，我一个星期就可以给你们制造出二十个！”并且极力散布空气，说文联没有右派。王希坚还阻挠山东人民出版社对右派分子王福慧的斗争。
