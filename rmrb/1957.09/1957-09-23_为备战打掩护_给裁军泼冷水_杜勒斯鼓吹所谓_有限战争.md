Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 21st: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in an article published in the October issue of "Foreign Affairs," advocates that the United States should actively prepare to use nuclear weapons to wage a so-called "limited war."

He said that in order to prepare for "small wars," by 1960, "the countries around the Sino-Soviet border" should possess an "effective force," a "highly mobile and well-deployed" nuclear weapon, such as "atomic cannons."

Dulles openly stated in the article that disarmament negotiations that stipulate a certain level of military strength "have always been and will always be a futile task," and that historical "disarmament" efforts "have proven ineffective" because military potential is "impossible to estimate."

Dulles reiterated that the U.S. nuclear weapons testing cannot be interrupted. He pointed out that one should not think that "human instincts will prevent us (the United States) from using nuclear weapons." He said that the United States is studying an "atomic weapons stockpile" and is preparing to establish such a stockpile in the European region of the North Atlantic Group and supply atomic weapons to the countries in these regions.

In the article, Dulles tried hard to make people believe that now so-called "limited nuclear war" can be waged with "tactical atomic weapons." He said that this may make the United States "less dependent on the deterrent power of massive retaliation."

It is remembered that for several years, Dulles has been actively advocating "massive retaliation." However, this rhetoric of advocating "atomic holocaust" did not scare others, but caused panic among U.S. allies and within the United States. Especially after the successful testing of Soviet intercontinental missiles, the fear of so-called "massive retaliation" in the United States has increased. This may explain why Dulles is changing his rhetoric when he continues to advocate nuclear war, and proposes a "new strategic concept" of so-called "limited nuclear war."

In fact, just as atomic weapons are fundamentally difficult to distinguish between so-called "strategic" and "tactical," the so-called "limited nuclear war" is also equally deceitful.

    为备战打掩护　给裁军泼冷水
    杜勒斯鼓吹所谓“有限战争”
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在10月份一期的“外交季刊”上发表一篇文章，鼓吹美国要积极准备用核武器来进行所谓“有限战争”。
    他说，为了准备“小型战争”，要在1960年前使“中苏边界周围的各国”拥有一种“有效的力量”，一种“十分机动的、布置十分妥当的”核武器，例如“原子核大炮”等。
    杜勒斯在文章中公然说：规定某种军事力量水平的裁军谈判“一直是并且将永远是一种徒然的工作”，历史上的“裁军”努力“已经证明无效”，因为军事潜力是“无法估计”的。
    杜勒斯重申，美国的核武器试验不能中断。他指出，不要认为，“人道的本能将阻止我们（美国）使用核武器”。他说，美国正在研究一种“原子武器储存”，并且准备在北大西洋集团欧洲地区建立这种储存和对这些地区的国家供应原子武器。
    杜勒斯在文章中竭力企图要人相信，现在可以用“战术性原子武器”来从事所谓“有限核战争”。他说，这样也许可能使美国“较少地依靠大规模报复的威慑力量”。
    人们记得，几年来，杜勒斯一直是积极鼓吹“大规模报复”的。但是，这种鼓吹“原子核大屠杀”的言论并没有吓倒别人，倒是在美国盟国及美国国内引起了恐慌。特别是在苏联洲际导弹试验成功以后，美国国内对所谓“大规模报复”的疑惧更加甚了。这也许可以说明，为什么杜勒斯在继续鼓吹核战争的时候要变换说法，提出所谓“有限核战争”的“新战略概念”。
    实际上，正像原子武器根本很难区分为所谓“战略性”和“战术性”一样，所谓“有限核战争”也同样是欺人之谈。
