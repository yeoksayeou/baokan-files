    Four-Legged Duck Discovered in Vietnam
    A four-legged duckling that had just hatched has recently been discovered in Jian'an Township, Mu County, Thai-Miao Autonomous Region, Vietnam.

    The duckling has duck feet for its front two legs, but chicken feet for its rear two legs. This strange duckling weighs more than the other ducklings hatched with it and is growing faster.

    越南发现四脚鸭
    越南泰族—苗族自治区木州县简安社（乡）最近发现一只新孵出的四只脚的小鸭。
    这只鸭的前面两只脚是鸭脚，后面两只脚却像鸡脚。这只奇怪的小鸭的体重比在一起孵出的其它小鸭重，并且生长得快。
