Xinhua News Agency, 14th: In the anti-rightist struggle, Ta Kung Pao has exposed the treacherous and shameless anti-Party activities of Party Committee Secretary and Editor-in-Chief Yuan Yuming. The conspiracy of rightists Zhao Enyuan, Zhu Qiping, Xiao Li, Gu Guoquan, and others to restore the reactionary old Ta Kung Pao has also been completely shattered.

　　In the past month, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Ta Kung Pao has held several enlarged meetings to struggle against Yuan Yuming. It has been revealed that although Yuan Yuming has participated in the revolution for nineteen years and has been a Party member for seventeen years, he has consistently retained the selfish individualism brought to him by his rich peasant family. After the victory of the revolution throughout the country, Yuan Yuming's bourgeois individualism grew increasingly, and he always haggled over his own reputation and status. When Yuan came to work at Ta Kung Pao in 1954, this thinking became even more exposed. He was indifferent to political and business leadership, but tearfully demanded to be promoted in rank, often deliberately belittling the prestige of other Party leaders in order to elevate himself, wanting to turn Ta Kung Pao into Yuan Yuming's "independent kingdom." These serious mistakes of his had been seriously criticized by the newspaper's Party organization and superiors; however, Yuan Yuming feigned compliance and harbored resentment. Before the rectification campaign began at Ta Kung Pao, he was worried and afraid that the masses would give him opinions that would shake his Editor-in-Chief "throne." To this end, he did not hesitate to spread rumors and slander and undermine the Party's rectification movement within the newspaper, saying, "Rectification is a matter of hurting bones and tendons," and that the rectification in 1942 still left many people "unable to raise their heads." When all the staff of Ta Kung Pao actively helped the Party rectify, and Yuan Yuming's shameless sabotage conspiracy failed, Yuan Yuming resorted to any means and spared no effort to shift the brunt of the masses' opinions onto other Party leaders in the company. He fueled the big-character posters of rightists attacking the Communist Party, writing, "It is very good to expose the darkness within the Party in this way." At the same time, he secretly talked to some people (some of whom were rightists) to carry out anti-Party sectarian activities. For example, when Yuan Yuming secretly talked with the rightist Zhu Qiping, he first proposed to make a "gentleman's agreement" and instructed "do not tell anyone." In this secret talk, Zhu Qiping told Yuan Yuming the main content of his reactionary newspaper program. Zhu Qiping's reactionary newspaper program advocated turning Ta Kung Pao into a "civilian newspaper" that overrides the Communist Party and the government, with "reporting on internal contradictions of the people" as its main task. Yuan Yuming nodded frequently, expressing his approval of this reactionary newspaper program. Then, Yuan Yuming pretended to be pitiful and complained to Zhu Qiping, slandering that there were factions within the Party, how he was bullied and beaten, and concluded that the root cause of Ta Kung Pao's problems was sectarianism, and that sectarianism gave rise to bureaucracy and subjectivism, thereby begging the rightists for help.

　　Because Yuan Yuming carried out a series of anti-Party activities and created a large number of shells for the rightists to attack the Party, at the end of May and the beginning of June, an anti-Party and anti-socialist adverse current suddenly swept through Ta Kung Pao. Some big-character posters and wall newspapers attacked "sectarianism" within the Party, and tried their best to render the Party's internal life "full of dark secrets." Rightists such as Zhao Enyuan, Zhu Qiping, Xiao Li, and Gu Guoquan took the opportunity to stir up trouble, trying to overthrow the Party Committee of Ta Kung Pao and restore the old Ta Kung Pao. Some people also posted big-character posters, openly inviting Xu Ying, Peng Zigang, and other rightists in the Party to come back and plot together. Zhu Qiping, in a letter to Peng Zigang, said triumphantly: "Soon we can join forces."

　　The reason why Yuan Yuming exposed his anti-Party ugly face during the rectification campaign was because he made a wrong assessment of the situation at that time. He believed that the Party could not stand firm in Ta Kung Pao, and the rightists of Ta Kung Pao were about to gain power, so Yuan Yuming chose the path of "Naji," raised the white flag, and ganged up with the rightists to attack the Party. When he thought that he had formed an anti-Party clique and his position was secure, he began to retaliate against those who had given him opinions. At noon on June 1, this leader of the rectification leading group secretly changed his handwriting and posted an anonymous notice, maliciously attacking the Party and League members who had given him opinions, and insulting a female comrade as a "female yaksha."

　　After the anti-rightist struggle began, Yuan Yuming was deeply afraid that his conspiracy would be exposed, so he tried his best to protect the rightists in order to obstruct this struggle. After the rightist Zhao Enyuan had already made one or two confessions at the Democratic League branch symposium, Yuan Yuming went to comfort him. He told Zhao Enyuan in the capacity of the Party Committee Secretary and the leader of the rectification leading group: "We are taking the overall situation into consideration and protecting you." He also told Zhao Enyuan the analysis opinions of the rectification leading group on certain issues and on certain Party and League members and activists. Yuan Yuming also repeatedly attacked the person in charge of the Democratic League branch rectification leading group, advocating that Zhao Enyuan participate in the Democratic League branch rectification leading group. He said: "Don't make it too stiff."

　　The anti-Party conspiracy of Yuan Yuming, this class alien, once put the Party organization of Ta Kung Pao in an extremely difficult situation.

　　According to other revealed materials, the rightists' conspiracy to restore the old Ta Kung Pao was very rampant. They all shouted the vicious slogan of "no destruction, no construction," beautified the old Ta Kung Pao, which was reactionary to the extreme and acted as the executioner of Kuomintang reactionary ideas; boasted of its reactionary "prominent social status" and colonial shameful "international status," and even described it as a "transcendental" civilian newspaper; glorified some of the reactionary Ta Kung Pao's editing and writing skills, and vilified and negated today's Ta Kung Pao, trying to bring down today's Ta Kung Pao and realize their restoration conspiracy. Zhao Enyuan, who was the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Ta Kung Pao, had worked in the old Ta Kung Pao for more than 20 years. With his scissors and red pen, he did not know how many progressive manuscripts he had buried and how many reactionary articles he had peddled. During the rectification campaign, he used his position as the Director of the Democratic League Ta Kung Pao branch to convene a symposium, trying his best to discredit and stink the Party Committee of Ta Kung Pao. Zhu Qiping, who had long served as the special correspondent of the old Ta Kung Pao in the United States and vigorously touted the "Marshall Plan," put forward a reactionary newspaper program. Xiao Li and his wife Xiao Feng said that the central government's decision to make Ta Kung Pao a national, political newspaper focusing on finance and economics and conducting international propaganda at the same time was wrong. They also actively carried out liaison activities inside and outside the newspaper, and conspired with rightists such as Peng Zigang to restore the old Ta Kung Pao. Gu Guoquan was a naked restorer, he arrogantly clamored: to "turn Ta Kung Pao over," to "be the real masters," and to "recover lost ground" among intellectuals.

　　Now, this group of rightists who conspired to let the old Ta Kung Pao "return to life" has been defeated. All the staff of Ta Kung Pao are in high spirits and are chasing after the victory.

　　勾结大小鬼怪妄图使旧大公报借尸还魂
　　大公报总编辑袁毓明无耻反党
    据新华社14日讯  在反右派斗争中，大公报揭露出了党组书记、总编辑袁毓明的奸险无耻的反党活动。右派分子赵恩源、朱启平、肖离、顾国权等企图复辟反动旧大公报的阴谋也已宣告彻底破产。
    在过去一个月里，中共大公报党组几次召开扩大会议，对袁毓明展开斗争。据揭露，袁毓明虽然参加革命十九年，入党十七年，可是，他一贯保存着富农家庭带给他的自私自利的个人主义。革命在全国范围内胜利后，袁毓明的资产阶级个人主义日益滋长，总是斤斤计较自己的名誉、地位。1954年袁到大公报工作，这种思想更加暴露，他对于政治领导和业务领导漠不关心，却哭哭啼啼地要求提高级别，经常故意贬低别的党员领导同志的威信，借以抬高自己，想把大公报变为袁毓明的“独立王国”。他的这些严重错误，曾经受到报社党组织和上级的严肃批评；可是，袁毓明却阳奉阴违，怀恨在心。大公报开始整风以前，他忧心忡忡，害怕群众给他提意见而动摇了他的总编辑“宝座”，为此，不惜在报社内部到处散播流言蜚语，诬蔑和破坏党的整风运动，说：“整风是伤筋骨的事”，又说1942年整风，至今还有许多人“抬不起头来”。当大公报的全体工作人员积极起来帮助党整风，袁毓明的无耻破坏阴谋没有得逞时，袁毓明就不择手段、费尽心机，企图把群众提意见的锋芒转移到社内别的党员领导同志身上。他在右派分子向共产党进攻的大字报上加油加火，写道：“这样来揭露党内的黑暗，好得很。”同时，他又找一些人（有些是右派分子）密室谈心，进行反党的宗派活动。例如袁毓明在和右派分子朱启平密谈时，先提出要订一个“君子协定”，并叮嘱“对任何人都不要讲。”在这次密谈中，朱启平向袁毓明谈到了他的反动办报纲领的主要内容。朱启平的反动办报纲领主张把大公报办成一张驾凌于共产党和政府之上的“民间报纸”，以“报道人民内部矛盾”为主要任务。对于这个反动办报纲领，袁毓明频频点头，表示赞同。接着，袁毓明装成一副可怜相，向朱启平诉苦，诬蔑党内有宗派，他如何受气挨整，并作出结论：大公报的毛病根子是宗派主义，由宗派主义才产生出了官僚主义和主观主义，以此向右派分子哀告求援。
    由于袁毓明进行了一系列反党活动，替右派分子制造了大量向党进攻的炮弹，所以5月底6月初大公报社内突然掀起了一股反党反社会主义逆流，一些大字报、壁报纷纷攻击党内“宗派主义”，极力把党内生活渲染得“黑幕重重”。赵恩源、朱启平、肖离、顾国权等右派分子乘机兴风作浪，妄想推翻大公报的党组，复辟旧大公报。有些人还张贴大字报，公开请徐盈、彭子冈等党内右派分子回来，共谋大业。朱启平在写给彭子冈的信中，曾得意忘形地说：“不久我们就可以会师了”。
    袁毓明之所以在整风期间暴露了他的反党丑恶面目，是因为他对当时的形势作了错误的估计。他认为党在大公报站不住脚了，大公报右派分子就要得势了，于是袁毓明就选择了“纳吉”的道路，树起了白旗，与右派一起勾搭向党进攻。当他自认为已经组成反党小集团，自己的地位已可确保之后，就开始向他提过意见的人进行打击报复。6月1日中午，这位整风领导小组长竟偷偷摸摸地，改换笔迹贴出了一张匿名招贴，对给他提过意见的党团员进行恶毒的人身攻击，辱骂一位女同志是“母夜叉”。
    反右派斗争开始之后，袁毓明深恐自己的密谋暴露，就竭力庇护右派分子，以便阻挠这一斗争。在右派分子赵恩源已在民盟支部座谈会上作了一两次交代之后，袁毓明还去安慰他。他以党组书记和整风领导小组长身分的口吻对赵恩源说：“我们是顾全大体的，是保护你的”。他还把整风领导小组对某些问题和对某些党团员、积极分子的分析意见全盘告诉了赵恩源。袁毓明还一再打击民盟支部整风领导小组的负责人，主张让赵恩源参加民盟支部整风领导小组。他说：“不要弄得太僵。”
    袁毓明这个阶级异己分子的反党阴谋，曾经使大公报的党组织处于极端困难的境地。
    另据揭露的材料证实：右派分子复辟旧大公报的阴谋活动是十分猖獗的。他们都嚷叫着“不破不立”的恶毒口号，把那个反动透顶的、
  做国民党反动思想刽子手的旧大公报加以美化；鼓吹它的反动的“显赫社会地位”和殖民地的可耻的“国际地位”，甚至把它说成是“超然的”民间报纸；把反动大公报的某些编采技巧加以神化，并丑化和否定今天的大公报，企图搞垮今天的大公报，实现他们的复辟阴谋。身为大公报副总编辑的赵恩源，过去曾在旧大公报干过二十多年，凭他的剪刀和红笔，不知葬送了多少进步的稿件，贩卖了多少反动的文章。整风期间，他利用民盟大公报支部主任委员的身分，召开座谈会，极力想把大公报的党组抹黑，搞臭。曾经长期担任旧大公报驻美特派员，并大力吹嘘“马歇尔计划”的朱启平，提出了反动的办报纲领。肖离和他的妻子肖凤说中央确定大公报以财经为主，同时进行国际宣传的全国性、政治性报纸的方针是错误的。他们并且在报社内外积极进行串连活动，和右派分子彭子冈等人密谋恢复旧大公报。顾国权是一个赤裸裸的复辟者，他狂妄地叫嚣：要“大公报翻身”，要“当真正的主人翁”，要在知识分子中“收复失地”。
    现在，这伙阴谋让旧大公报“借尸还魂”的右派分子已经溃败。大公报全体工作人员斗志高昂，正乘胜追击中。
