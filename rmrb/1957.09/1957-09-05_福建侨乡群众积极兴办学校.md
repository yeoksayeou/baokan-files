    Fujian Overseas Chinese Hometown Masses Actively Establish Schools

    (Our dispatch) Fujian Province's overseas Chinese hometowns are preparing to establish supplementary secondary schools and cultural schools for the children of overseas Chinese. To date, a total of 150 supplementary classes and cultural classes for overseas Chinese children have been established throughout the province, which can accommodate many overseas Chinese children who did not pass the entrance exams for further studies.

    The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is sponsoring a supplementary school for the children of overseas Chinese in Jimei, with plans to enroll 500 students. This year, Jinjiang's districts and townships are preparing to establish nearly 40 secondary cultural classes for overseas Chinese children, as well as correspondence writing supplementary classes and English supplementary classes. The Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation is preparing eight supplementary classes. Key overseas Chinese hometowns such as Nan'an, Yongchun, Longxi, Haicheng, Longyan, Fuzhou, Minhou, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Fuqing have also established supplementary classes for overseas Chinese children.

    The expenses of these schools are partly maintained by collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees, and partly by donations from overseas Chinese relatives who are enthusiastic about cultural and educational undertakings in their hometowns. This year, the State Council has specially allocated 330,000 yuan to Fujian Province as a subsidy for establishing supplementary classes for overseas Chinese children. The broad masses of overseas Chinese and their relatives have expressed their infinite gratitude for the government's concern.

    福建侨乡群众积极兴办学校
    本报讯　福建省侨乡筹办华侨子女中等补习学校和文化学校，到目前为止，全省筹办华侨子女补习班和文化班共有一百五十个，可安置许多考不上学的华侨子女入学补习。
    全国华侨联合会在集美倡办一所侨属子女补习学校，计划招生五百名。晋江今年各区乡筹办华侨子女中等文化班将近四十个，还有尺牍补习班和英文补习班。厦门市侨联会筹办八个补习班，南安、永春、龙溪、海澄、龙岩、福州、闽侯、漳州、泉州、福清等地重点侨乡都创办了华侨子女补习班。
    这些学校的经费一部分由收学杂费维持；一部分由热心家乡文教事业的侨眷捐助。今年国务院特别拨款三十三万元给福建省作为补助筹办华侨子女补习班的经费，广大华侨侨眷对政府的关怀表示无限感激。
