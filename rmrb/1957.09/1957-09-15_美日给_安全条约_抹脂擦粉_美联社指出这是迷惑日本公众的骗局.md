Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 14th: The United States and Japan today exchanged notes in Tokyo clarifying the relationship between the US-Japan Security Treaty and the United Nations Charter.

In its note, the United States assured Japan that the US-Japan Security Treaty "fully complies" with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The US and Japan also reached three points of "common understanding": both the US and Japan believe that the Security Treaty does not affect the rights and obligations of the two governments under the United Nations Charter, or the responsibility of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security; at the same time, the two governments will resolve any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means, without resorting to force or taking any actions that violate the purposes of the United Nations; measures that may be taken under the Security Treaty should comply with the provisions of the United Nations Charter regarding the right of a country under armed attack to exercise individual or collective self-defense and should be reported to the Security Council.

The US-Japan Security Treaty was signed by the United States and Japan in 1951. This unequal treaty has been widely attacked by the Japanese people, who have long demanded its abolition. The exchange of notes between the United States and the Japanese government this time, in order to ease this strong sentiment of the Japanese people, does not fundamentally change the military and aggressive nature of this treaty.

The Associated Press said that this exchange of notes was carried out at the request of the Japanese government, which is obviously a political gesture aimed at making the Japanese public regard the Security Treaty signed during the American occupation of Japan as "equal."

### 美日给“安全条约”抹脂擦粉  美联社指出这是迷惑日本公众的骗局

　　美日给“安全条约”抹脂擦粉
　　美联社指出这是迷惑日本公众的骗局
    据新华社14日讯  东京消息：美国同日本今天在东京交换了照会，说明日美安全条约和联合国宪章之间的关系。
    美国在照会中向日本保证，日美安全条约“充分符合”联合国宪章的精神。日美双方并且达成三点“共同的谅解”：美日双方认为安全条约不影响两国政府在联合国宪章下的权利和义务，或者是联合国维持国际和平和安全的责任；同时，两国政府要以和平方法解决它们可能被牵涉在内的任何国际争端，而不使用武力或者采取任何违背联合国宗旨的方式；根据安全条约所可能采取的措施，应该符合联合国宪章关于受武力攻击的国家有行使单独或者集体自卫的权利的规定，并且报告安全理事会。
    美日安全条约是美国同日本在1951年签订的。这一不平等条约一直受到日本人民的广泛攻击，他们早就提出废除这一条约的要求。美国和日本政府这次为了缓和日本人民的这种强烈情绪而交换的照会，根本没有改变这个条约的军事的和侵略的性质。
    美联社说，这次交换照会是应日本政府的要求而进行的，这显然是一种政治姿态，目的在于让日本公众把在美国占领日本期间签订的安全条约看作是“平等的”。
