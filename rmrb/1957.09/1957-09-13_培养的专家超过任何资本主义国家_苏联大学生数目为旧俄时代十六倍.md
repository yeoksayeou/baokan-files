　　Training of Experts Exceeds Any Capitalist Country
    The Number of Soviet University Students is Sixteen Times that of Old Russia
    (Our Moscow dispatch, September 12th) The Soviet Union has long surpassed any capitalist country in training specialized personnel. As early as 1955, the number of engineers graduating in the Soviet Union was more than double that of the United States. In this century-long plan, which is of decisive significance for the development of culture and science, the Soviet Union has been working hard for forty years as if it were one day. Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin announced these brilliant achievements at a press conference today. He said that since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union has trained more than 3.5 million specialized personnel with higher education, including about one million engineers. In 1957 alone, 265,000 specialized personnel graduated, and more than 80,000 graduated from correspondence courses and night universities. This year, 80,000 engineers were trained, 11,000 more than last year. In 1958, the Soviet Union will train 315,000 experts, including 90,000 engineers.
    Yelyutin made a clear comparison between the situation before and after the revolution. He said that in pre-revolutionary Russia, higher education was restricted for women, and almost inaccessible to ethnic minorities and the poor. At that time, there were only sixteen cities in the country with institutions of higher learning, mainly in the central cities. In two hundred and fifty years, a total of only 127,000 college students graduated from 105 institutions of higher learning. After the revolution, the doors of higher education were opened to workers and peasants. By the end of the first five-year plan period, the Soviet Union already had 645 institutions of higher learning, educating 492,000 college students. The number of college students increased to 811,000 in 1940 and to 1,867,000 in 1956. The number of college graduates in 1956 was sixteen times that of 1914. The number of college students studying technology was 187,000 in 1940 and 650,000 in 1956. Schools are also responsible for training atomic energy experts. Moscow University has nuclear physics and accelerator departments; the Power Institute studies atomic power plants, and the Steel, Petroleum, and Agricultural Colleges study the use of tracer atoms. The distribution of institutions of higher learning has also changed. Now there are institutions of higher learning in 270 cities in the Soviet Union, and branches and consultation offices of colleges in 578 locations. The number of college students studying in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union is 3.2 times that of 1940. Institutions of higher learning are located in various republics: Ukraine has 134, Uzbekistan has 36, Kazakhstan has 25, and the three Baltic republics have 28.
    Yelyutin said that the Soviet Union exchanges college students and researchers with nearly 20 countries. In addition to socialist countries, there are also India, Indonesia, Egypt, France, and so on. About 14,300 foreign college students are now studying in the Soviet Union.

　　培养的专家超过任何资本主义国家
    苏联大学生数目为旧俄时代十六倍
    本报莫斯科12日电　苏联在培养专门人才方面早已超过任何资本主义国家。远在1955年，苏联毕业的工程师就为美国的两倍多。在这项对于文化和科学的发展有决定意义的百年大计上，苏联四十年如一日地努力着。苏联高等教育部部长叶留金在今天的记者招待会上宣布了这方面的辉煌成就。他说：在苏维埃政权建立以来，苏联培养了三百五十多万名受过高等教育的专门人才，其中约一百万名工程师。仅仅在1957年就有二十六万五千名专门人才毕业，有八万多名由函授班和夜大学毕业。今年培养了八万名工程师，比去年多一万一千名。在1958年，苏联将培养出三十一万五千名专家，包括九万名工程师。
    叶留金把革命前和革命后的情景作了一个鲜明的比较。他说，在革命前的俄国，高等教育对于妇女是有限制的，而对于少数民族和贫苦阶层几乎是不许问津的。当时全国只有十六个大城市有高等学校，主要是中部的城市。在二百五十年中，从一百零五所高等学校总共才毕业十二万七千名大学生。革命后，高等学校的大门为工农敞开了。到第一个五年计划时期末，苏联已经有六百四十五所高等学校，教育着四十九万二千名大学生。大学生数目在1940年增长到八十一万一千名，在1956年增加到一百八十六万七千名。1956年毕业的大学生为1914年的十六倍。学习技术的大学生数目在1940年有十八万七千名，在1956年就有六十五万名了。学校还负有培养原子能专家的任务。莫斯科大学有核子物理和加速器系；电力学院研究原子能发电站，钢铁、石油、农业学院研究示踪原子的利用。高等学校的分布也起了变化。现在苏联的二百七十座城市有高等学校，五百七十八个地点有学院的分院和质疑处。在苏联东部地区学习的大学生为1940年的三点二倍。高等学校遍设在各个共和国：乌克兰有一百三十四所，乌兹别克斯坦有三十六所，哈萨克斯坦有二十五所，在波罗的海沿岸三个共和国有二十八所。
    叶留金说：苏联同近二十个国家交换大学生和研究员。除了社会主义国家以外，还有印度、印度尼西亚、埃及、法国等等。约有一万四千三百名外国大学生现在苏联学习。
