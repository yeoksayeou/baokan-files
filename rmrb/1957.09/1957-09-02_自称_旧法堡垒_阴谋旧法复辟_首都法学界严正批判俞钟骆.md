Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. The capital's legal circles held four consecutive symposiums from August 13th to 30th, comprehensively exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist crimes of Yu Zhongluo, a backbone rightist element in the legal field.

    Yu Zhongluo is an advisor to the Supreme People's Court and the chairman of the China Democratic League branch of the Supreme People's Court. Standing on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie and harboring deeply ingrained old legal views, he has consistently hated the Communist Party and the people's revolutionary cause. Yu Zhongluo, who calls himself an "old law bastion," acted as a vanguard in the legal field during the Great Blooming and Contending, attacking the fundamental system of our proletarian dictatorship, first and foremost from the perspective of the functions of the People's Courts. He smeared the courts, saying that "in the past, they only emphasized dictatorship and did not pay attention to correctly handling contradictions among the people." He opposed classifying habitual thieves, swindlers, murderers, and other serious criminal offenders as targets of the dictatorship. Speakers at the meeting also revealed a large number of facts showing that Yu Zhongluo's opposition to the proletarian dictatorship was consistent. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign in 1951, he said, "Revolution and counter-revolution killing each other are the same in nature," and "the people's tribunals for suppressing counter-revolutionaries are the same as the Kuomintang's special criminal courts." He smeared our campaigns to suppress counter-revolutionaries and purge counter-revolutionaries as "using harsh penalties in times of chaos" and openly advocated that counter-revolutionaries should be treated with "no retroactive punishment and a narrow scope of attack." It was revealed that Yu Zhongluo also used his position to spare no effort in defending counter-revolutionaries while insulting the working people in every possible way. As early as 1950, he defended a foreign priest who beat Liu Gaiying, a Chinese working woman; regarding the crime of Qiao Zhiliang, a Chinese priest, raping Liu Gaiying, he actually said, "Liu Gaiying had illicit relations with a priest who was religiously bound from marriage, and according to the anti-feudal viewpoint, even if Qiao Zhiliang took the initiative, there was no error or crime." Recently, he also tried to exonerate Huang Yuntao, a counter-revolutionary with bloody debts who murdered eighteen revolutionary cadres and masses before liberation, saying that he should not be sentenced to death. Yu Zhongluo was particularly hostile to the state public security organs and procuratorial organs, which serve as tools of the people's democratic dictatorship, falsely claiming that public security cadres "seriously violated laws and discipline" and cursing the procuratorial organs as "eating food but not taking care of things." In his work of providing materials for drafting the Criminal Procedure Law, he insisted that "there is no place for public security organs in the Criminal Procedure Law."

    Yu Zhongluo launched a malicious attack on the country's judicial policies. He attacked our trial work for having "unclear boundaries between crime and non-crime." Disregarding the fact that the policy towards counter-revolutionaries has always been a combination of suppression and leniency, he denied that the implementation of policies should grasp the boundaries of leniency and strictness according to changes in the country's political situation and the needs of revolutionary work. He exaggerated individual shortcomings of judicial cadres in implementing policies as errors in the entire guiding ideology, attacking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries policy as "wavering." The meeting pointed out that it is clear from this that Yu Zhongluo's malicious slander is aimed at the Communist Party's leadership over judicial work, attempting to fundamentally negate the correctness and necessity of the anti-revolutionary suppression policy formulated by the Party.

    In terms of the trial system, Yu Zhongluo deliberately did not mention Article 11 of the "Arrest and Detention Regulations," which stipulates that an interrogation should be conducted within 24 hours of arrest to decide on detention, release, or release on bail. At the same time, he disregarded the fact that the vast majority of arrests and detentions in actual work were correct, and even if there were individual cases of wrongful arrest or detention, they have been promptly corrected in accordance with the principle of "errors must be corrected." He wantonly attacked judicial work as "not distinguishing between arrest and detention," "detaining everyone who is arrested," and "random arrests and detentions." Yu Zhongluo deliberately did not mention that trial organs implement a people-friendly trial system for second-instance cases based on different circumstances, such as holding trials on-site, conducting investigations, or summoning the parties to court. Instead, he lumped together the courts' practice of not summoning parties for certain cases where it was not necessary to avoid wasting manpower and resources, saying that "the parties are not summoned for second-instance trials." He used this to attack and curse the People's Government. Participants at the meeting denounced Yu Zhongluo's absurd and malicious clamor.

    The meeting also revealed that Yu Zhongluo harbored deep-seated hatred for judicial reform. He tried his best to smear judicial reform as "factional struggle" and "using a big stick" against old legal personnel. He said that the current trial organs are "born deficient and acquired unbalance." He smeared the government, saying that after judicial reform, "while negating the old law, it negated all legal scientific knowledge" and that "it did not pay much attention to cultivating new legal talents." But he never mentioned the fact that the People's judicial organs have always attached importance to studying the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism on law and legal scientific knowledge and have cultivated a large number of new-type legal talents. Everyone pointed out that the essence of Yu Zhongluo's fallacies is to restore the old bourgeois legal system and let the old legal personnel "take the stage."

    At the meeting, everyone pointed out that Yu Zhongluo's counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist crimes are not accidental, but have their class roots. Before liberation, Yu Zhongluo lived in Shanghai for a long time and worked as an old lawyer for more than 20 years. After the Anti-Japanese War, he defended a major traitor. Yu has always claimed to be a freelance professional, but in fact, during the Anti-Japanese War, he was also the manager of the Shanghai Universal Pharmaceutical Factory, owning more than 300 taels of gold and nearly 10,000 yuan in stocks, an out-and-out capitalist. After liberation, he consistently showed dissatisfaction with the Communist Party, and even expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the addition of the word "People's" before "Court, Bank, and People's Liberation Army."

    自称“旧法堡垒”  阴谋旧法复辟
    首都法学界严正批判俞钟骆
    新华社1日讯  首都法学界从8月13日到30日连续举行了四次座谈会，全面揭露和批判了法学界右派骨干分子俞钟骆反共、反社会主义的罪恶言行。
    俞钟骆是最高人民法院的顾问、民盟最高人民法院支部主任委员。他站在资产阶级的反动立场上，怀着根深蒂固的旧法观点，一贯仇视共产党和人民的革命事业。自称“旧法堡垒”的俞钟骆，在大鸣大放期间，充当了法学界的反共、反社会主义的急先锋，首先从人民法院的职能方面来攻击我国无产阶级专政的根本制度。他污蔑法院“过去只强调专政，不重视正确处理人民内部矛盾”，他反对把惯窃、诈骗、凶杀等严重的刑事罪犯列为专政的对象。会上发言的人还揭露出大量事实，说明俞钟骆反对无产阶级专政的思想是一贯的。1951年镇反运动时，他曾说：“革命与反革命互相屠杀，其性质是一样的”，“镇反人民法庭和国民党的特刑庭一样”。他污蔑我们镇反、肃反运动是“乱世用重典”，并公然主张对反革命分子“不溯既往，打击面不要太宽”。据揭露，俞钟骆还利用其工作职权，不遗余力地为反革命分子辩护，而对于劳动人民却百般进行污辱。早在1950年，他曾为殴打我国劳动妇女刘改英的一个外国神父开脱罪责；对中国籍神父乔志亮奸污刘改英的罪行，竟说成“刘改英与有宗教束缚不能结婚的神父相奸，按照反封建的观点，即便乔志亮主动，也谈不上什么错误与犯罪”。最近他又力图为解放前残杀过革命干部和群众十八人的血债累累的反革命分子黄云涛开脱死罪，说不应该判处死刑。俞钟骆对作为人民民主专政工具的国家公安机关及检察机关特别仇视，诬说公安机关的干部“严重违法乱纪”，咒骂检察机关“吃粮不管事”。他在为起草刑诉法提供资料的工作中硬说“刑诉法中没有公安机关的地位”。
    俞钟骆对于国家的审判政策进行了恶毒的攻击。他攻击我们审判工作“罪与非罪界限不清”，不顾对反革命分子的政策历来就是镇压与宽大相结合的事实，否认执行政策应随着国家政治形势的变化和革命工作的需要来掌握从宽从严的界限。他把司法干部在执行政策中的个别缺点，夸大为整个指导思想的错误，攻击镇反政策“左右摇摆不定”。会上指出，从这里显然可以看出俞钟骆恶意的污蔑是把矛头指向共产党对司法工作的领导，企图从根本上否定党所制定的镇反政策的正确性与必要性。
    在审判制度方面，俞钟骆故意不谈“逮捕拘留条例”第十一条关于逮捕后应于二十四小时内进行讯问，决定羁押、释放或取保候审的规定，同时，无视实际工作中捕、押的绝大多数都是正确的，即使有个别的错捕、错押，也已本“有错必纠”的原则及时予以纠正的事实，而肆意攻击司法工作是“捕押不分”，“有捕必押”，“乱捕乱押”。俞钟骆故意不提审判机关对于二审案件根据不同情况，实行就地审判、下去调查或传唤当事人到庭等便利人民的审判制度，而对法院为了避免劳民伤财，对某些不必要传唤当事人的案件不传唤当事人的作法，却笼统地说成是“二审不传唤当事人”。他并借此攻击和咒骂人民政府。与会者痛斥了俞钟骆的这种荒谬的恶意的叫嚣。
    会议还揭发出俞钟骆对司法改革怀着刻骨铭心的仇恨。他竭力污蔑司法改革是“宗派斗争”，对旧法人员是“一棍子打死”。他说现在的审判机关“先天不足，后天失调”。污蔑政府在司法改革后“与否定旧法的同时，否定一切法律科学知识”，“对于培养新的法律人才很不重视”。而他对于人民司法机关一贯重视学习马克思、列宁主义关于法律的基本理论和法律科学知识，培养了大批新型法律人才的事实，却绝口不谈。大家指出，俞钟骆的这种谬论，其实质就是要恢复资产阶级的旧法统，让旧法人员“上台”。
    会上，大家指出：俞钟骆反共、反社会主义的罪恶言行并非偶然，而是有其阶级根源的。俞钟骆在解放前，长期住在上海，任旧律师二十多年，在抗日战争后为大汉奸作过辩护。俞一向自称是自由职业者，实际上在抗日战争中他还是上海通用药厂的经理，拥有黄金三百多两，股票近万元，是一个不折不扣的资本家。解放后，他一贯对共产党不满，甚至连“法院、银行、解放军”之上有“人民”两字，他也表示极为不满。
