    Little Sister Er Climbing the Stairs

    My family has six people. Before liberation, we farmed twelve mu of land for the landlord. We suffered from famine every year, and we couldn't even eat enough grain to last through the New Year. Wild vegetables and tree leaves were our daily meals. Since liberation, our lives have been improving step by step, getting better day by day. But some people "forget the pain once the wound is healed." My father is like this. He now eats dry rice every day and doesn't even want to eat thin porridge. But he also says that there is less grain now, and some other people are also talking nonsense like this. Isn't this forgetting our roots? Some people say that life now is like Wang Xiaoer's New Year, getting worse every year. This is the nonsense of landlords and rich peasant elements. I say that now it is Little Sister Er climbing the stairs, rising higher and higher.

    小二姐上楼梯
    我家六口人，解放前种了地主十二亩田，年年闹饥荒，丰收年的粮食也吃不到过年。野菜、树叶是家常饭。解放以来，生活步步上升，一天比一天好。可是有些人是“好了疮疤忘了痛”。我父亲就是这样。他现在天天吃干饭，连稀粥也不愿意吃了。可是他也说现在的粮食少了，还有一些人也是这样随嘴瞎说。这不是忘本了吗？有人说，现在的生活是王小二过年，一年不如一年，这是地主富农分子的胡说。我说，现在是小二姐上楼梯，步步登高。
