Changchun, September 28th (by our newspaper). The thousands upon thousands of opinions put forward by the broad masses of workers during the blooming and contending process have become a tremendous driving force for improving work in various factories and mines in Jilin. The Changchun Railway Sub-bureau has already processed over 80% of all opinions. In the First Automobile Factory, some opinions raised by workers in the morning were addressed by the afternoon. Big-character posters put up in the morning became important issues for cadres to discuss at meetings in the evening. Workers at the Jilin Provincial Machinery Factory asked: The rolling bed has been delivered for more than a year, why is it sitting idle? After hearing this, the leading cadres immediately sent people to install the rolling bed, and it is now almost completely installed. Some old problems that had been accumulating in some factories for two or three years have now been solved in only two or three days. Workers in the chassis workshop of the First Automobile Factory made a suggestion two years ago, requesting the construction of a ladder to facilitate the repair of taller machine tools, but this was never realized. Recently, workers put up big-character posters criticizing this matter, and the workshop leading cadres immediately found people to study the issue and quickly made a ladder using waste materials. This new style of "quick study, quick solution, quick implementation" in dealing with the opinions of the masses has been deeply praised by the masses. Workers said: "This is what you call the real mass line! In the past, after the leadership sought our opinions, they always studied them, but nothing ever came of it. We hate this kind of half-mass line the most."

The biggest feature of this improvement work is the consistent implementation of the mass line, correcting the past phenomenon of starting strong but finishing weak or being a flash in the pan. After workers in many factories put forward their opinions, leading cadres first organized and studied them, then consulted with the workers before quickly making improvements. Some more important issues were always discussed with the workers several times before a decision was made. Some problems that could not be solved temporarily were also carefully explained to the workers. Workers at the Changchun Cigarette Factory put up big-character posters criticizing the shortcomings of failing to widely promote advanced experiences. Leading cadres held meetings, with the participation of the masses, to formulate specific plans for promoting advanced experiences, incorporating important and effective experiences into the process regulations and putting them into practice; and also specifically summarized newly emerging experiences, preparing to promote them in a planned way. Some workshop workers at the Changchun Auto Parts Factory said: We don't have enough work, and we have too much free time. What should we do about this waste? The factory directors held meetings with relevant personnel to study the issue, carefully arranged various labor forces, and used the surplus working hours to undertake a batch of electroplating and stamping tasks.

This method of relying on the masses to vigorously improve work has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to offer opinions.

### 吉林厂矿充分依靠群众改进工作

    吉林厂矿充分依靠群众改进工作
    本报长春28日电　广大职工在鸣放中提出的成千上万条意见，已成为吉林各厂矿改进工作的巨大推动力量。长春铁路分局已经处理了全部意见的80％以上。第一汽车厂有些工人上午提的意见，下午就得到处理。早晨贴出的大字报，晚上就成了干部们开会研究的重要问题。吉林省机械厂工人提出：滚床运来一年多时间，为啥闲着不用？领导干部听了之后，立即派人安装滚床，现在快要安装好了。有些工厂积压二、三年之久的老问题，现在只用二、三天时间就解决好了。第一汽车厂底盘车间工人在两年前提出建议，要求修个梯子，便于修理较高的机床，但是始终未能实现。最近工人们贴出大字报批评这件事，车间领导干部随即找人研究，利用废料赶修成梯子。这种“快研究、快解决、快实现”的对待群众意见的新作风，深受群众赞扬。工人们说：“这才叫做真正的群众路线！过去领导上征求咱们意见之后，老是研究，没得下文，咱们最讨厌这种半群众路线”。
    这次改进工作的最大特点是始终贯彻群众路线，纠正过去有头无尾虎头蛇尾的现象。不少工厂工人提出意见之后，领导干部先做了整理、研究，又找工人商量，然后很快改进。有些比较重要的问题，总要找工人开会研究好几次，才作出决定。有些暂时不能解决的问题，也细心向工人解释。长春卷烟厂工人贴大字报，批评先进经验推而不广的缺点。领导干部开会，吸收群众参加，具体拟定出推广先进经验的方案，把重要的行之有效的经验纳入工艺规程中去，付诸实行；并且又具体总结新出现的经验，准备有计划地加以推广。长春汽车配件厂有些车间工人说：咱们活太少，闲的时候多，这种浪费怎么办？厂长们找有关人员开会研究，详细安排各种劳动力，利用剩余工时，承揽了一批电镀、冲压的任务。
    这种依靠群众狠狠改进工作的方法，更加鼓舞了群众提意见的积极性。
