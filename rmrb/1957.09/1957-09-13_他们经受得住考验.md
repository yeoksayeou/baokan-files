　　They Can Withstand the Test
　　Our Correspondent　Wen Shuxian
　　Along the Ji(lin) Chang(chun) Highway, about eight or nine li, you will reach the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Changchun City. Here, hundreds of male and female cooperative members are busy accumulating fertilizer, picking vegetables... Basket after basket of purple eggplants, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and peppers are loaded onto large carts and taken to the city.

　　This cooperative welcomed twenty-two high school and junior high school graduates in July this year. These students resolutely left their families to go to the countryside, and in their labor, they have all withstood the test, overcome many difficulties, and strived to be good cooperative members.

　　Initially, when they went to the fields, the old farmers taught them how to press pumpkin vines, cut chives, plant celery, and hoe the ground... These tasks are light work in agricultural production, but they found them very strenuous. At the beginning of the work, they were very enthusiastic and energetic, chatting and laughing with the old farmers while humming songs. After a few days, the singing gradually subsided. They felt exhausted, their backs and arms ached, and they walked weakly. Holding a hoe to shovel the ground felt like holding a thousand-pound weight, with each strike going astray; bending down to pick vegetables made it impossible to straighten up; squatting down to press pumpkin vines caused sharp pain in their stiff legs. The weather was also unkind, with heavy rain pouring down, soaking them to the bone; then the scorching sun would beat down, and the moist soil would emit a dizzying heat. Some couldn't take it and fell ill. Some had diarrhea, others caught a cold and headache. During these difficult times, the Party organization, township and cooperative cadres, farmers, and school teachers took great care of them. When they were sick, they bought medicine for them in the city, didn't wake them up to go to the fields in the morning, and let them rest more. When they fell behind in their work, the old farmers helped them. Those who were physically weak were assigned to lighter work. Everyone comforted and encouraged them, saying, "Don't be impatient, rest for a couple of days when you're tired before going back to the fields." "It's very tiring at first, but you'll get used to it after a few days." Except for a few physically weaker individuals who wavered at times, most of them were determined and bravely fought against fatigue. Junior high school graduate Guo Xuezhong carried tomatoes for five consecutive days, and a large lump formed on his shoulder. He said, "This lump was created through hard work. If I didn't bear the pain to develop this lump, I would never be able to be a farmer." Wu Guanglu, also a junior high school graduate, was assigned to the large field team. Blisters formed on his palms, but he still went to the fields every day to hoe the millet. The eight female students were also afraid of falling behind. With this tenacious perseverance, they overcame many difficulties and have now learned production skills such as tying cucumber trellises, cutting chives, picking eggplant leaves, harvesting onions, and weeding. Their bodies have also become stronger.

　　"These young men and women are really something! It looks like they can really stay in the cooperative for a long time." This is the old farmers' comment on them. Before these students came to the cooperative, the township had educated the cooperative members, and the members welcomed them very much. But there were also concerns that the students wouldn't be able to endure hardship. They said, "How can middle school students participate in production? They won't stay for long even if they come." The students changed the farmers' minds with their practical actions. The farmers treated them as "treasures." Whenever cultural matters were needed, they would ask them to do them.

　　They have also become interested in agricultural production. Some people say, "It's a waste of twelve years of schooling for high school graduates to farm the land." High school graduate Cui Dianwen's personal experience is not like that. He believes that growing vegetables, from soil, water, fertilization, pruning, pinching, and pressing vines, all require knowledge of botany and chemistry. He said to people, "I can't bear to leave agricultural production anymore." The other students have also settled down and are used to labor and life.

　　They live scattered in the homes of cooperative cadres and members. These families all have young people, and they live together like siblings, sleeping, eating, working, and playing together. Each person takes out seven yuan a month for food, oil, salt, firewood, and coal. The cooperative gives each person two cents of private land, and the vegetables grown are used for cooking money. The cooperative prepays seven yuan per month for food expenses and two yuan for pocket money, which is repaid after the autumn harvest. To date, these students have generally earned over one hundred work points, and Wu Guanglu, Guo Xuezhong, and others have reached over two hundred work points. It is estimated that each working day will be worth 2.16 yuan, and by the end of the year, they can earn up to over two hundred yuan, and generally over one hundred and fifty yuan, with an average monthly income of twenty-five to thirty-four yuan. In the first half year of their participation in production, there are no problems with food, clothing, and housing. Under their influence, after them, four or five hundred high school and junior high school graduates living in the city have gone to the countryside in Changchun City.

　　他们经受得住考验
　　本报记者　温述仙
    沿着吉（林）长（春）公路，约莫走八、九里，就到达长春市郊区的曙光农业生产合作社。在这里，几百个男女社员正在忙着积肥、摘菜……。一筐筐紫茄子、西红柿、黄瓜、葱、辣椒被装上大车，拉到城里去。
    这个合作社里，今年7月来了二十二个高、初中毕业生。这些学生毅然离开家庭到了农村，而且在劳动中，都经受得住考验，克服了许多困难，努力争取做一个好社员。
    最初，他们下地的时候，老农民把着手教他们压南瓜蔓、割韭菜、栽芹菜、薅地……，这些活计在农业生产中是轻活，但是他们做起来却是非常吃力的。刚开始劳动，他们热情很高，精力旺盛，一边干活一边还和老农民们说说笑笑，嘴上哼着歌曲。过了几天，歌声便逐渐沉寂了。他们感到精疲力竭，腰酸臂痛，走起路来软绵绵的。手握着锄头铲地，像拿着千斤重的东西似的，东一锄西一锄不随心意；弯下腰去摘菜，身子直不起来；蹲下去压南瓜蔓，僵硬的腿就发出剧痛。天公还不作美，一会大雨倾盆，淋得他们全身都湿了；一会烈日当空，湿润的泥土冒出令人发昏的热气。有的人支持不住，闹起小病来了。有泄肚的，有伤风头痛的。在这困难的时候，党组织、乡、社干部和农民以及学校的教师对他们非常照顾，病了替他们到市里买药，早晨不叫醒他们去下地，让他们多休息，干活落在后面，老农民便去帮着干，身体弱的调他们做轻活。大家都安慰、鼓励他们说：“不要性急，累了就歇两天再下地。”“乍一干活很累，做几天就好了。”他们当中除了个别身体较弱的人曾经一度有一些动摇外，绝大部分人都是坚决的，勇敢地和疲劳搏斗。初中毕业生郭学忠连挑了五天西红柿，肩膀上压出一个大疙瘩。他说：“这个疙瘩是硬锻炼出来的，要是不忍痛磨出这个疙瘩，我就永远不能做农民。”吴广禄也是初中毕业生，分配在大田队，他的手掌磨起了血泡，还是天天下地薅谷子。八个女同学也生怕落在人后。他们以这种顽强的毅力，克服了重重困难，现在已经学会了绑黄瓜架、割韭菜、打茄叶、起葱、除草……等生产技能，身体也锻炼得结实了。
    “这些小伙子、姑娘真行啊！看样子真能在社里呆长。”这是老农民对他们的评语。在这些学生未到合作社之前，乡里曾经对社员进行了教育，社员们都很欢迎他们来。但是也有顾虑，怕学生吃不了苦。他们说：“中学生那能参加生产？来了也干不长。”学生们用实际行动改变了农民们的看法。农民们把他们当成“宝贝”，只要用得着文化的事，都找他们去做。
    他们对农业生产也发生了兴趣。有人说：“高中毕业生去种地，白读了十二年书。”高中毕业生崔殿文的亲身体会并不是这样的。他认为种植蔬菜，从土壤、水份、施肥、打叉、掐尖、压蔓等等方面来看，都用得着植物学和化学知识。他对人说：“我已经舍不得离开农业生产了。”其他的同学也都安下心来，劳动和生活已经习惯了。
    他们分散住在社干部和社员的家里，这些人家都有青年人，他们如亲兄弟姐妹一样生活在一起，同睡、同吃、同劳动，一块玩。每个人一月拿出七元钱作买粮食、油盐、柴煤的费用，社里给每人二分自留地，种植的蔬菜做菜钱。社里每月预支伙食费七元，零用钱两元，秋收后缴还。到目前为止，这些学生一般的都得了一百多个工分，吴广禄、郭学忠等人已经达到二百多个工分。预计每个劳动日分二元一角六，到年底他们最多的能够收入二百多元，一般的能够收入一百五十元以上，平均每个月收入二十五元至三十四元。在他们参加生产的头半年，吃、穿、住都没有问题。在他们的影响下，长春市继他们之后，已经有四、五百名家住城市的高、初中毕业生走向农村。
