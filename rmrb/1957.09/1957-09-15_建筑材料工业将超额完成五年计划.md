　　Building Materials Industry Will Overfulfill the Five-Year Plan
    (Reported by our newspaper) The various targets set by the Ministry of Building Materials Industry's first Five-Year Plan are expected to be overfulfilled in their entirety. The output value level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan was reached ahead of schedule in October last year, and is expected to exceed it by 25% this year. The output of cement, the main product, reached the level of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in November last year, and is expected to exceed it by 15% this year; the output of plate glass reached the level of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in July this year, and is expected to exceed it by 11% by the end of the year. The planned cumulative cost reduction rate for the five years is 22.6%, and it is expected to be reduced by 29%. It is also expected that the labor productivity of production workers will exceed the Five-Year Plan target by 27%.
    The building materials industry has developed rapidly in these five years. Compared with 1952, cement production in 1957 increased by 1.3 times, and plate glass production increased by more than 1.1 times.
    During the Five-Year Plan period, the promotion of new technologies and advanced production experiences from the Soviet Union, fraternal countries, and our country played a great role in the development of the building materials industry. For example, the experience of manufacturing multi-variety and multi-grade cement introduced by Soviet cement expert Comrade Mikhailiuda, after being promoted in China's cement industry, only required a small increase in equipment to produce more than one million tons of cement each year, and the quality of cement also improved. According to the suggestions of Comrade Xilin, an expert from Democratic Germany, after improving the Lepol rotary kiln, the production capacity of the equipment was brought into play. Wang Xiliang, a worker-cadre of the Mudanjiang Cement Plant, improved the feeding port of the Lepol rotary kiln, producing more than 700 tons of cement each year.
    In terms of capital construction, the cumulative capital construction investment for the five years is expected to exceed the plan by more than 8%. Five construction projects in the Five-Year Plan have been completed on schedule and put into production, and the remaining projects are being actively carried out, and it is expected that two projects can be overfulfilled.

　　建筑材料工业将超额完成五年计划
    本报讯  建筑材料工业部第一个五年计划所规定的各项指标，预计可以全部超额完成。五年计划规定的产值水平已在去年10月提前达到，预计今年将超过25％。主要产品水泥的产量已在去年11月提前达到了五年计划水平，预计今年将超过15％；平板玻璃产量已在今年7月提前达到了五年计划水平，预计到年底将超过11％。五年累计的成本降低率计划为22.6％，预计将降低29％。生产工人劳动生产率预计也可以超过五年计划指标27％。
    建筑材料工业在这五年中发展是很快。跟1952年比较，1957年水泥产量增长了一点三倍，平板玻璃产量增长了一点一倍多。
    在五年计划期间，推广苏联、兄弟国家和我国的新技术、先进生产经验，对建筑材料工业的发展起了极大的作用。如苏联水泥专家米哈依留达同志介绍的苏联制造多品种多标号水泥的经验，在我国水泥工业推广后，只增加少数设备，每年就多产水泥一百多万吨，水泥的质量也有提高。根据民主德国专家西林同志的建议，改进了立波尔式回转窑后，发挥了设备的生产能力。牡丹江水泥厂工人干部王喜良同志改进立波尔式回转窑的下料口，每年就多生产水泥七百多吨。
    在基本建设方面，五年累计的基本建设投资额，预计将超额完成8％以上。五年计划中的建设工程，已有五个按期竣工并投入生产，其余的项目正在积极进行，预计可以超额完成二个项目。
