Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Capital legal circles held a symposium today to pursue the rightists Tan Tiwu and Yang Yuqing, powerfully criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of these two rightists. Zhang Wenxiu, a delegate to the Third National Women's Congress and Vice President of the Shanghai Higher People's Court, attended the meeting and revealed new materials about Tan Tiwu's anti-communist activities in Shanghai.

Zhang Wenxiu said that Tan Tiwu took advantage of her inspection in Shanghai this April to carry out many anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. In addition to the facts already revealed in the newspapers that Tan Tiwu overturned verdicts for counter-revolutionaries and exonerated them in Shanghai, she also incited cadres to oppose the Communist Party in the Shanghai Higher People's Court. When listening to reports on civil cases, she repeatedly asked the judges in an inciting tone, "Without codified law, do you have difficulties in judging cases?" After the meeting, she said to individual leading cadres of the court, "The Party's policy instructions cannot be used as the basis for judging cases. If you have difficulties in handling cases, you can protest to the Central Committee." Zhang Wenxiu also said that Tan Tiwu was very hostile to worker-peasant cadres during her inspection in Shanghai. At the report meeting, when she learned that the judges reporting to her had not received specialized legal training or were not graduates of law schools, she said rudely and condescendingly, "I don't want you to speak." At a forum of former lawyers held in Shanghai, she maliciously said, "Lawyers with high levels of expertise are not handling cases, while those who are workers, have low professional skills, and cannot even write good complaints are handling cases." She believed that this was "bias" and demanded timely correction.

State Councilors Li Zhonggong, Chen Xiuhe, and Wang Genzhong, and China Political Science and Law Association council member Guo Lun spoke at the meeting, pointing out that Yang Yuqing was a thoroughly reactionary rightist who was plotting the restoration of capitalism. In his speech, Guo Lun comprehensively criticized Yang Yuqing's various reactionary remarks, such as wanting the Communist Party to "step down from power" and inciting intellectuals to "oppose the status quo." Guo Lun said that according to recently revealed materials, Yang Yuqing not only wanted to be Vice Minister of Justice, but also secretly campaigned to become a representative of the National People's Congress. This spring, under the pretext of returning to Wuhan to visit relatives, he sought out Ma Zhemin and Yan Xunfu, the backbone rightists in Hubei Province, and asked them to help him be elected as a representative of the National People's Congress in Hubei Province in the 1958 general election.

### 首都法学界追击谭惕吾杨玉清  又揭露这两个右派分子一些反动活动材料

　　首都法学界追击谭惕吾杨玉清
　　又揭露这两个右派分子一些反动活动材料
    新华社19日讯　首都法学界座谈会今天乘胜追击右派分子谭惕吾、杨玉清，有力地批驳了这两个右派分子的反动言行。出席妇女第三次全国代表大会的代表、上海市高级人民法院副院长张文秀到会揭发出谭惕吾在上海进行反共活动的一些新的材料。
    张文秀说，谭惕吾今年4月利用在上海视察的机会，进行了许多反共、反社会主义的活动。除报上已揭发出谭惕吾在上海为反革命翻案和开脱罪责的事实外，她还在上海市高级人民法院煽动干部反对共产党。她在听取民事案件的汇报时，再三带着煽动的口吻问审判人员，“没有成文法，你们判案有无困难？”会后，她又向法院个别领导干部说：“党的政策指示不能作判案的根据，你们办案有困难，可以向中央提出抗议”。张文秀又说，谭惕吾在上海视察时很仇视工农干部。在汇报会上，当她知道向她汇报工作的审判人员没有受过法律方面的专门训练或者不是法律学校毕业的，她便以粗暴的态度盛气凌人地说，“不要你讲”。她在上海召开的旧律师座谈会上恶意地说：“水平高的律师没有办案，而工人出身、业务不高、诉状也写不好的人却在办案”。她认为这是“偏向”，要求及时纠正。
    国务院参事李仲公、陈修和、王艮仲和政法学会理事郭纶在会上发言，指出杨玉清是一个反动透顶图谋资产阶级复辟的右派分子。郭纶在发言中全面地批驳了杨玉清要共产党“下台下轿”，煽动文人起来“反对现状”等各种反动言论。郭纶说，据最近揭发出的材料，杨玉清不仅想当司法部副部长，还秘密活动想当全国人民代表大会代表。今春他以回武汉省亲的名义，找湖北省的右派骨干分子马哲民和晏勋甫，要他们帮助他在1958年普选时能在湖北省选为全国人民代表大会代表。
