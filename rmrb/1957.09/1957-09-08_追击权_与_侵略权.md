    "Right of Pursuit" and "Right of Aggression"
    On September 1st, the French army, driven dizzy by the Algerian People's Armed Forces, actually sneaked into the territory of the Republic of Tunisia, claiming to be "pursuing Algerian rebels." They even opened fire on the Tunisian army, killing one Tunisian National Guard member and six Tunisian regular army soldiers.
    This news aroused immense indignation among the Tunisian people and infuriated all people with a sense of justice. The Tunisian government has formally protested to France. Tunisian Minister of State, Radham, sternly condemned France's banditry and stated that they would use their legitimate right of defense to counter the French colonial army's arbitrary violation of Tunisian territorial sovereignty.
    However, in a speech at the Chignia Air Force Base, French Defense Minister Maurice not only did not express any apology for the French colonial army's invasion of Tunisia but also insisted that the French invading army in Algeria had the right to exercise the "right of pursuit" to violate Tunisian territorial sovereignty. The Supreme Commander of the French forces in Algeria, Salan, even believed that the French army should continue to exercise this "right of pursuit" in the future.
    The so-called "right of pursuit" fabricated by French military leaders is nothing more than a despicable pretext for their actions of invading other countries' territorial sovereignty. To put it bluntly, "right of pursuit" is "right of aggression," nakedly exposing their contempt and hatred for the independent Tunisian people.
    Since the Tunisian people declared independence on March 20 last year, French colonialists have consistently failed to treat Tunisia as an equal. In particular, the independent Tunisian people's sympathy and support for the Algerian people's struggle has made the French colonialists even more resentful. In May of this year, they announced the cessation of all financial aid to Tunisia, intending to stifle the vitality of independent Tunisia through economic means. This time, they have even fabricated the so-called "right of pursuit" to invade Tunisian territory, showing that they want to blatantly re-invade Tunisia.
    The French colonialists have stationed one million troops in Algeria and spent billions of dollars on a dirty colonial war. However, under the resistance of the heroic and unyielding Algerian people, France has not only run into walls militarily and been at a loss, but also impoverished its own country, causing widespread complaints. If the French colonialists still want to expand their aggression in North Africa and incite more North African people to resist them, then it can be asserted that the future awaiting the French colonialists will definitely not be pleasant!

### “追击权”与“侵略权”

    “追击权”与“侵略权”
    9月1日，被阿尔及利亚人民武装力量打得昏头转向的法国军队，居然窜进了突尼斯共和国境内，说是为了“追击阿尔及利亚叛乱分子”，他们却对突尼斯军队开了火，打死了一个突尼斯国民警卫队队员和六个突尼斯正规军队的士兵。
    这个消息，激起了突尼斯人民的万分愤慨，也激恼了一切有正义感的人们。突尼斯政府已向法国正式提出了抗议；突尼斯国务部长拉德哈姆严厉谴责了法国的强盗行径，并表示将用正当的防卫权利来对付法国殖民军对突尼斯领土主权的任意侵犯。
    但是，法国国防部长摩里斯在西尼亚空军基地发表的谈话中，对法国殖民军侵犯突尼斯的事不仅没有表示任何歉意，并且硬说在阿尔及利亚的法国侵略军队有权行使“追击权”侵犯突尼斯的领土主权。法国驻阿尔及利亚三军最高司令萨兰甚至认为，法国军队今后还要继续行使这种“追击权”。
    法国军事首脑人物制造的所谓“追击权”，不过是他们为侵犯别国领土主权的卑鄙行动而巧立的名目。说穿了，“追击权”就是“侵略权”，赤裸裸地暴露了他们对独立的突尼斯人民的藐视和仇恨。
    自从去年3月20日突尼斯人民宣布独立以来，法国殖民主义者一直不以平等的态度对待突尼斯。特别是独立了的突尼斯人民同情和支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，更使法国殖民主义者仇恨不已。今年5月间，它就曾宣布停止对突尼斯的一切财政援助，打算以经济手段来窒息独立的突尼斯的生机。这次竟制造出所谓“追击权”来侵犯突尼斯领土，可见它是想要明火执杖地重新打进突尼斯去。
    法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚陈兵一百万，花了几十亿美元来进行肮脏的殖民战争。可是在英勇不屈的阿尔及利亚人民抗击下，法国不仅在军事上到处碰壁，一筹莫展；并且把国内弄得民穷财尽，怨声载道。如果法国殖民者还想在北非扩大侵略，激起更多的北非国家人民来反抗它，那末，可以肯定地说，等待着法国殖民者的前途决不是美妙的！（峰）
