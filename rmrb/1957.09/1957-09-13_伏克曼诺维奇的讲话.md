Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch. The full text of the speech given by Vukmanović, Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, at the banquet is as follows: Comrade Premier, comrades and friends, ladies and gentlemen:

　　I am very pleased to have the opportunity to visit the People's Republic of China at the invitation of Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai to learn about its efforts and achievements in building socialism. At the same time, I would like to express my sincere respect and best wishes to the Chinese people and government on behalf of the people and government of our country.

　　I am very glad to hear Comrade Premier pointed out the arduous struggles of the Chinese and Yugoslav people for democratic freedom, and the establishment of socialist relations between them. I am convinced that this similarity in the past fate of our two peoples provides a good foundation for close and friendly cooperation between us.

　　The respective struggles of our two peoples to gain liberation and create conditions for building a socialist society have prompted us to respect each other and generated a common desire for further mutual understanding and cooperation. Precisely because of this, such positive results have been achieved in the short period since the establishment of direct relations between our two countries, which proves that there are strong conditions for further development. I believe that our visit and the exchange of views and experiences on issues of mutual concern will help further develop our relations in the political, economic, cultural and other fields. Such friendly relations between China and Yugoslavia are not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also help strengthen world peace and promote equal cooperation between countries. As you know, we have visited some Asian countries with the aim of familiarizing ourselves with the problems of these countries and their efforts, and exploring the possibility of expanding Yugoslavia's ties with these countries in the economic, cultural and political fields. I believe that such cooperation can only be friendly and beneficial if it is built on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and non-interference in internal affairs. We hope to establish such mutual relations with all countries, regardless of the differences in our social systems. At the same time, we feel that setting artificial political obstacles to the development of economic relations between countries will hinder the overall economic development of the world, and especially the economic development of underdeveloped countries that need such development most.

　　The demands of the people of the world for maintaining peace and strengthening cooperation have created favorable prospects for further easing international tensions and strengthening the principles of active peaceful coexistence. But there is one prerequisite for realizing this prospect, and that is active mutual contact and connection between countries without discrimination. Therefore, it is already very clear today that all countries should be allowed to participate in solving those problems that are of universal significance to everyone, and it is particularly difficult to consider problems without the direct participation of countries like the People's Republic of China. It can be seen from this that artificially hindering the People's Republic of China from directly participating in the resolution of various international issues as a member state of the United Nations, and not recognizing the legitimate territorial sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, has caused serious damage to the people of all countries and the world situation. We will continue to do everything in our power to change this increasingly intolerable situation.

　　Please allow me, on behalf of the people and government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and in my personal name, to propose:

　　For the further achievements of the people of your great country in building socialism,

　　For the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Yugoslavia,

　　To the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,

　　To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,

　　Cheers!

　　伏克曼诺维奇的讲话
    新华社12日讯　南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇在宴会上的讲话，全文如下：总理同志，同志们和朋友们，女士们和先生们：
    我受周恩来总理同志的邀请，得有机会来访问中华人民共和国，了解它在建设社会主义方面的努力和成就，感到十分愉快。同时，我愿代表我国人民和政府，向中国人民和政府表示衷心的敬意和良好的愿望。
    我很高兴的听到总理同志指出了中南两国人民各自进行过的争取民主自由的艰苦斗争，以及他们之间的社会主义的关系的建立。我深信，我们两国人民过去命运的这种相似，为我们之间的密切而友好的合作提供了良好的基础。
    我们两国人民为获得解放以及为建立社会主义社会创造条件而各自进行的斗争，促使我们相互尊敬，并且产生了更进一步相互了解和合作的共同愿望。正因为如此，在我们两国建立直接关系以来的短期间内，已经能够取得这样的积极成果，这证明了进一步发展的有力条件是存在着的。我相信，我们的访问以及在双方关心的问题上交换意见和经验，将有助于进一步发展我们两国在政治、经济、文化和其他方面的关系。中南两国之间的这种友好关系不仅有益于我们两国的人民，而且有助于加强世界和平和促进国际间的平等合作。正像你们所知道的，我们已访问了一些亚洲国家，我们的目的是在于熟悉这些国家的问题和它们所作的努力、以及探索扩大南斯拉夫和这些国家在经济、文化和政治方面的联系的可能性。我相信，这种合作只有建筑在互相尊重主权、平等和互不干涉内政的基础上，才能是友好和有益的。我们希望同一切国家建立这种相互关系，不论我们的社会制度有何不同。同时，我们觉得，对各国之间的经济关系的发展设立人为的政治障碍，是会妨碍全世界总的经济发展，特别是会妨碍最需要这种发展的不发达国家的经济发展的。
    全世界人民对维护和平和增强合作的要求，已经创造了进一步和缓国际紧张局势和加强积极和平共处的原则的有利前景。但是实现这一前景有一个前提，那就是各国间没有歧视地、积极地相互接触和联系。因此今天已经很明白，应该让一切国家参加解决那些对大家有普遍意义的问题，而如果没有像中华人民共和国这样的国家直接参加，考虑问题是特别困难的。由此可见，人为地阻碍中华人民共和国，作为联合国的一个会员国，直接参与各种国际问题的解决，以及不承认中华人民共和国的合法的领土主权，对于各国人民和世界局势造成了严重的损害。我们将继续尽一切力量来改变这种令人愈来愈不能容忍的局面。
    请允许我代表南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的人民和政府并以我个人的名义提议：
    为你们伟大的国家的人民在建设社会主义中获得进一步的成就，
    为中南两国人民的友谊和合作，
    为中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志的健康，
    为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的健康，
    干杯！
