A critique of Xu Maoyong's theory of "Common Human Nature"
Li Fanfu

The question of human nature has been a frequent subject of debate throughout history. Not to go too far back, fifteen or sixteen years ago, there was a Wang Shiwei in Yan'an who advocated a reactionary theory of human nature. Wang Shiwei's theory of human nature abstracted human nature, distorting it into an absolute concept transcending time and space. In Wang Shiwei's view, everyone had two unrelated essences: one was human nature as a person, and the other was a person's political nature. He once wrote on a wall newspaper that his bones were divided into two types: one was the bones of a human being, which should be judged by those who understood him and the broad masses who came into contact with him, and the other was the political bones of a party member, which should be judged by the Organization Department of the Central Committee. Wang Shiwei abstractly understood people as monsters detached from society and history. Wang Shiwei's fallacy was not his own invention, but was based on Trotsky's views. Trotsky believed that revolution was not an expression of class struggle, but the liberation and development of a supra-class human nature. Trotsky slandered the peasants as a "reactionary force," saying that this was a manifestation of the peasants' selfish and bad human nature. Trotsky believed that art was also an expression of supra-class human nature, so he denied the existence of proletarian literature and art, and obliterated the necessity of the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work. Wang Shiwei used this reactionary theory of human nature to oppose the Party and the people, propagating how excellent their own human nature was and how "corrupt" the Communist Party's human nature was, and so on. These anti-Party and anti-people fallacies were shattered in a struggle fifteen years ago. All comrades who participated in the Yan'an Rectification Campaign have vivid memories. Today, fifteen years later, bourgeois right-wing elements are repeating Wang Shiwei's platitudes, slandering the Communist Party as only knowing Party spirit and not knowing human nature. This is not surprising, because in order to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism, the right-wing elements can use any reactionary weapon, including the reactionary theory of human nature.

However, Xu Maoyong, who also participated in the rectification campaign, is again singing the tune of common human nature at a crucial moment when the rightists are frantically attacking the Party and socialism, which cannot but attract our attention. Xu Maoyong published an article entitled "An Outdated Commemoration – Rereading 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" in Wenhui Daily on June 7th and 8th. In the section "On Human Nature" in this article, while he does not deny that people have class character, he argues that people have a common general human nature. He said: "The fact that human beings have a common general human nature, just as they also have a common biological nature with other creatures, cannot be denied. It is only in class society that human nature 'has class character'." This theory of his is consistent with the above-mentioned view that people have two kinds of bones. Of course, today's Xu Maoyong is different from Wang Shiwei, but Xu Maoyong's theory of common human nature is more developed than Wang Shiwei's theory of human nature.

First, Xu Maoyong quoted many Marxist phrases and philosophical terms, attempting to prove that human beings do indeed have a general common human nature. He attempted to apply the philosophical categories of the general and the specific to explain the relationship between general human nature and class character, and compared human nature to "production in general" or "common biological nature." Such random application and comparison is really comparing apples and oranges. Within the same class, it is acceptable to use the general and the specific to explain the relationship between class character and individuality; however, it is completely wrong to think that different classes also have a common general human nature. We know that human nature is social and historical, and is a product of certain social relations, not innate. Feuerbach also regarded human essence as an abstract thing detached from history, reducing human essence to reason, will, and love. After exposing Feuerbach's mistake, Marx put forward the Marxist understanding of human essence: "But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations" (Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach"). Isn't Marx's statement clear? Why are these words not quoted, but some irrelevant words are quoted? Where did Marx say that he approved of a general abstract human nature? In class society, society is composed of various different classes. Different class positions lead to different human nature. Therefore, apart from the specific class human nature, there cannot be any general common human nature. The exploiting class and the exploited class cannot have a common human nature. The greatest characteristic of the exploiting class's human nature is to exploit the exploited, and to exploit as much as possible, while the human nature of the exploited class is the opposite, they oppose exploitation and demand the reform of the social system. In class society, class character and human nature are consistent and cannot be separated, and Party spirit is a concentrated expression of class character. The proletariat is the most advanced and revolutionary class in history, therefore the proletariat's human nature is the most excellent human nature in history, and the Communist Party's Party spirit is a concentrated expression of the proletariat's class character. A person with the strongest Party spirit must also be the most beautiful person in terms of human nature; conversely, a person with a poor Party spirit cannot have a beautiful human nature. This is a matter of general common sense, and any philosophical reasoning cannot overthrow this common sense. Xu Maoyong said: "In practice, those who do not recognize human nature and think that they have a very strong proletarian character only turn their behavior into affectation, and cannot understand the psychology of others; and in creation, they will only make the characters in their works seem unreasonable." We say that if people with a truly strong proletarian character must also be the most beautiful people in terms of human nature, they can understand the Party's policies, have good contact with the masses, and understand the psychology of the masses, why would such people become affected? Why would such people make the characters in their works seem unreasonable? Could it be that those who talk a lot about general common human nature but have a poor Party spirit or proletarian character can do better reasonably? Of course, no matter how strong a person's Party spirit is, there will be people who are dissatisfied and opposed to him; that is, those who have no common language with him, people with different or opposite class positions.

Second, Xu Maoyong has new views on the Chinese bourgeoisie. Xu Maoyong said: "If there is not some common human nature as a basis, why can the Chinese bourgeoisie be transformed into socialists?" This theory is obviously even more wrong.

Everyone knows that the reason why the Chinese bourgeoisie can be transformed into socialists is not because they have a "common human nature as a basis." The so-called human nature of the bourgeoisie is to exploit the surplus labor of the working class, and to exploit as much as possible. After socialist transformation, some of them are still very unwilling to give up. The government treats them very favorably, giving them a fixed interest rate for seven years, but some of them still think it is not enough, they want to take a fixed interest rate for twenty years, and they want to take it all at once, and they also want to remove the label of bourgeoisie. What a great plan this is! This is the expression of their class character and also their human nature. The Chinese working class would not have such human nature. So, where is the "basis of common human nature"? We know that from the perspective of exploitative relations, the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is originally antagonistic. However, under the specific conditions in China, due to the Chinese Communist Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie, and because the bourgeoisie is willing to accept this policy, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie has been transformed from an antagonistic contradiction to a non-antagonistic contradiction. After the transformation, capitalist ownership is replaced by socialist ownership. With the change of the social economic base, the bourgeois ideology in the social superstructure can have a basis for being transformed. Under such specific social conditions, if the bourgeoisie honestly accepts the transformation, and in the future the fixed interest rate is abolished, the tail of exploitation is cut off, and after long-term practical training, after "reforming their thinking," it is possible to be transformed into socialists. This is to look at problems from the perspective of dialectical materialism. But Xu Maoyong starts from idealism, believing that the bourgeoisie has a common human nature as a basis, so they can be transformed into socialists. According to Xu Maoyong's theory, anyone, even the likes of Dulles and Nolan, has a "common human nature as a basis" with us and can be transformed into socialists. Isn't this absurd? Xu Maoyong's theory is not only fundamentally unrealistic, but also very harmful to current practice. Zhang Naqi, a "theorist" of the bourgeois right-wing, believes that the Chinese bourgeoisie is a "red bourgeoisie," which no longer has duality, "there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements," and is currently in a "transition to the common nature of mankind." Xu Maoyong's theory of common human nature coincides with Zhang Naqi's fallacy. It can be imagined that Xu Maoyong's theory will be welcomed by Zhang Naqi and others; but it is harmful to current practice. This theory is not only not good for the proletariat, but also not good for those in the bourgeoisie who want to make progress. Because beautifying the bourgeoisie does not help the bourgeoisie progress, only by making the bourgeoisie recognize their duality and earnestly study on a voluntary basis can it be conducive to their transformation.

Xu Maoyong's issuance of this supra-class theory of human nature is by no means an accidental or isolated error. In his article "To Whom Does the Truth Belong?" (Literary Monthly, May), he believed that the statement that truth belongs to the proletariat is wrong. He said: "In our country now, there is no longer an antagonistic contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat… Bourgeois figures are also gradually acquiring some proletarian characteristics in the process of socialist transformation," "Those who are evaluated as proletarian may not fully have a proletarian attitude; and those who are evaluated as bourgeois may not have no proletarian attitude of seeking truth from facts." Therefore, he believes that "everyone can discover the truth, and everyone can make mistakes." In Xu Maoyong's view, there is no essential difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there is no need to draw a clear line between them.

No class boundaries, abandoning or losing the Party and the proletariat's position, this is the root cause of Xu Maoyong's mistakes. Due to this root cause, during the great blooming and contending, Xu Maoyong published many essays, such as "Weapons, Instruments of Torture and Props" (Yangtze Literature, May), "Depression" (ibid., June), "'Cicada Noise Residence' Jottings" (People's Literature, July), etc. These essays can be said to be poisonous weeds echoing the rightists and harmful to the people.

Over the years, Xu Maoyong has repeatedly made mistakes despite the Party's repeated education and the help of comrades, and has not changed his ways after repeated teachings. Now is the time to turn back completely.

    评徐懋庸的“共同人性”论
    李凡夫
    人性问题，从古到今，是常常争论的问题。远的不谈，十五、六年前，延安有一个王实味，曾经提倡过一种反动的人性论。王实味的人性论就是把人性抽象化，把人性曲解为超时间空间的绝对概念。在王实味看来，每个人有两种互不联系的本质：一种是当作人的人性，另一种是当作政治上的人。当时他在墙报上曾经写过，他的骨头分为两种：一种是做人的骨头，要由了解他的人和接触他的广大群众来鉴定，一种是党员政治上的骨头，要由中央组织部来鉴定。王实味把人抽象地了解为脱离社会、脱离历史的怪物。王实味的谬论，也不是他自己的新发明，而是根据托洛茨基的见解。托洛茨基认为革命不是阶级斗争的表现，而是超阶级的人性的解放与发扬。托洛茨基诬蔑农民为“反动的力量”，说这是农民自私自利的不良人性的表现。托洛茨基认为艺术也是超阶级的人性的表现，所以他否认有无产阶级的文艺，抹煞党对文艺工作领导的必要。王实味就是拿着这种反动的人性论来进行反党反人民，宣传他们自己的人性如何优良，共产党的人性如何“腐化”等等。这些反党反人民的谬论，在十五年前的一场斗争中早已被粉碎了。所有参加过延安整风的同志，都是记忆犹新的。在十五年以后的今天，资产阶级的右派分子，又重复王实味的滥调，诬蔑共产党只知有党性，不知有人性。这本来并不奇怪，因为右派分子为着反对共产党，反对社会主义，什么反动的武器都可以用上，包括反动的人性论在内。
    但是，也曾经参加过整风的徐懋庸，却在右派猖狂向党和社会主义进攻的重要关头，重新唱起了共同人性论，这就不能不引起我们的注意了。徐懋庸在6月7、8两日文汇报上发表了题为“过了时的纪念——重读‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’”一文。在这篇文章中“关于人性”的一段，他一方面不否认人有阶级性；另方面，他却主张人有共同的一般人性。他说：“人类之有共同的一般人性，正如它还有与其他生物共同的生物性一样，是不能否认的。只是在阶级社会里，人性就‘带有阶级性’”。他这种理论与上面说的人有两种骨头的主张是一致的。当然今天的徐懋庸与王实味是不同的，但是，徐懋庸的共同人性论比王实味的人性论更有所发展了。
    第一，徐懋庸引了许多马克思的词句以及哲学术语，企图证明，人类确有一般的共同人性，他企图套用一般与具体的哲学范畴，来说明一般人性与阶级性的关系，并且把人性与“生产一般”或“共同生物性”相类比。这样乱套和乱比，真是牛头不对马嘴。如果在同一阶级内，用一般与具体来说明阶级性与个性的关系，还是可以的；如果认为不同的阶级也有共同的一般的人性，那就是完全错误了。我们知道，人性是社会的、历史的东西，是某种社会关系的产物，并不是先天带来的。费尔巴哈也曾经把人的本质看作脱离历史的抽象的东西，把人的本质归结为理智、意志和爱情。马克思在揭露了费尔巴哈的这种错误之后，提出了马克思主义对人的本质的了解：“但是，人的本质，并不是个别的个体所具有的抽象属性。就其现实性来说，它是一切人的本质，社会关系的总和”（马克思：“费尔巴哈论纲”）。马克思的话不是说得明明白白么？为什么这些话不引，却引了一些与此毫不相干的话呢？马克思在什么地方说过，他赞成有一般的抽象的人性呢？在阶级社会里，社会是由各种不同的阶级组成的。阶级地位不同，人性也不同。因此，除了具体的阶级的人性之外，不可能再有什么一般的共同的人性。剥削阶级与被剥削阶级不可能有共同的人性。剥削阶级的人性，最大的特点就是剥削被剥削者，而且要剥削得愈多愈好，而被剥削阶级的人性，则与之相反，他们反对剥削，要求改造社会制度。在阶级社会里，阶级性与人性是一致的，不能分割开来，而党性则是阶级性集中的表现。无产阶级是有史以来代表最前进的最革命的阶级，因此无产阶级的人性是有史以来最优秀的人性，共产党的党性，是无产阶级性的集中表现。党性最坚强的人，其人性必然也是最优美的人；反之，如果党性很差的人，不可能有优美的人性。这是一般常识问题，任何舞文弄墨的哲理，都是推翻不了这种常识的。徐懋庸说：“在实践上，那些不承认人性而自以为无产阶级性极强的人们，则不过使自己的行为变为矫情，并且不能懂得别人的心理；而在创作上，也只会使得作品中的人物显得不合情理。”我们说，如果无产阶级性真正极强的人们，其人性必然也是最优美的人们，他们能够体会党的政策，很好的联系群众，懂得群众的心理，这样的人为什么会变成矫情？这样的人，为什么会在创作上使得作品中的人物显得不合情合理呢？难道那些大谈一般共同人性而党性或无产阶级性很差的人，倒能够做得更合情合理么？当然，党性无论怎样强的人，也是会有人不满意的、反对的；那就是那些没有共同语言的人，阶级立场不同或相反的人。
    第二，在对中国资产阶级的看法上，徐懋庸有了新的见解。徐懋庸说：“倘若没有某些共同的人性的基础，中国资产阶级为什么竟可以改造为社会主义者”。这种理论，显然更是十分错误的。
    谁都知道，中国资产阶级所以有可能改造为社会主义者，并不是由于他们有“共同人性的基础”。资产阶级的所谓人性，就是剥削工人阶级的剩余劳动，而且剥削的愈多愈好，在经过社会主义改造以后，他们有些人还很不死心，政府十分优待他们，给他们七年定息，但他们有些人还嫌不够，要拿二十年定息，而且要一次拿清，还要除掉资产阶级的帽子，这是多么好的打算！这就是他们的阶级性也是他们的人性的表现。中国工人阶级则不会有这样的人性。那么，“共同人性的基础”在什么地方呢？我们知道，从剥削关系来说，资产阶级与工人阶级的矛盾，本来是对抗性的。但是在中国的具体条件下，由于中国共产党对资产阶级采取和平改造的政策，又由于资产阶级愿意接受这种政策，于是工人阶级与资产阶级的矛盾就由对抗性矛盾转化为非对抗性矛盾。经过改造以后，资本主义所有制被社会主义所有制所代替。社会经济基础改变了，社会上层建筑中资产阶级的意识形态，才能有被改造的根据。在这样具体的社会条件下，如果资产阶级老老实实接受改造，将来把定息取消了，剥削尾巴割掉了，并且经过长期实践的锻炼，经过“脱胎换骨”，是可能改造为社会主义者的。这是从辩证唯物主义的观点看问题。但是徐懋庸却从唯心主义出发，认为资产阶级有共同的人性的基础，所以他们能改造为社会主义者。依照徐懋庸的理论，任何人，连诺兰、杜勒斯之流也与我们有“共同人性的基础”，也可以改造为社会主义者了。这岂不是十分荒谬么？徐懋庸的这种理论，不但根本不合实际，而且对当前的实践，是非常有害的。资产阶级右派的“理论家”章乃器认为，中国资产阶级是“红色资产阶级”，已经没有两面性，“资产阶级分子与工人阶级分子已经没有本质的差别”，目前正处在“向人类的共同本性过渡中”。徐懋庸的共同人性论，正与章乃器的谬论不谋而合。可以想见，徐懋庸的理论，一定为章乃器等人所欢迎；但是对于当前的实践是有害的。这种理论，不但对无产阶级没有好处，即使对资产阶级中要求进步的人也是没有好处的。因为把资产阶级美化，并不能帮助资产阶级进步，只有使资产阶级认识自己的两面性，在自愿基础上，认真努力学习，这样才有利于他们的改造。
    徐懋庸发出这种超阶级的人性论，决不是偶然的或个别的错误。他在“真理归于谁家”（文艺月报五月号）一文中，就认为真理归于无产阶级的说法是错误的。他说：“我国现在，资产阶级与无产阶级之间，已经不存在对抗性的矛盾了……资产阶级人士，在社会主义改造过程中，也渐渐地带些无产阶级气了”，“被评为无产阶级者，未必完全具有无产阶级的态度；而被评为资产阶级者，也未必一点没有无产阶级实事求是的态度”。因此他认为“人人可能发现真理，人人也可能弄出错误”。在徐懋庸看来，无产阶级和资产阶级之间，已经没有本质的区别，也不必划清他们之间的界限了。
    没有阶级界限，背弃或丧失党和无产阶级的立场，这就是徐懋庸犯错误的病根所在。由于这种病根，在大放大鸣中，徐懋庸发表了许多杂文，如“武器、刑具和道具”（长江文艺五月号），“苦闷”（同上刊六月号），“‘蝉噪居’漫笔”（人民文学七月号）等等，这些杂文可以说都是与右派相呼应的对人民有害的毒草。
    多年来，徐懋庸不顾党的一再教育与同志们的帮助，还是屡犯错误，屡教不改。现在到了彻底回头的时候了。
