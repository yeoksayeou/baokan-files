Xinhua News Agency dispatch. Chongqing news circles held a series of symposiums at the end of August to expose the anti-Party crimes of Jia Weiying, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Chongqing Daily.

This anti-Party element, with nearly twenty years of Party membership, harbored extremely serious bourgeois individualism and ambition, and was long dissatisfied with the Party. During this "blooming and contending" period, she used the so-called "Zuo Ye incident" to, without the consent of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC, take it upon herself to initiate and organize a symposium of some Chongqing journalists in the name of the Party newspaper to protest the "Zuo Ye incident." At this symposium, Jia Weiying incited from the outset, saying that there were people like "Zuo Ye" in Chongqing, and called on everyone to "vent their anger." Under her instigation, right-wing elements from the Chongqing Daily, radio station, and other units took the opportunity at the meeting to make a big fuss, spouting nonsense. They fabricated and exaggerated forty-two "incidents" to attack and scold the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Municipal People's Committee, and other so-called "Zuo Ye" in twenty-nine units throughout the city.

After the symposium, Jia Weiying said on the one hand that the meeting was very successful, and on the other hand, directed reporters to concentrate the exaggerated and fabricated "typical facts" from the meeting, writing a long news report and a communication of more than 4,000 words. She also published an editorial and accompanying cartoon, which were published on the front page of the Chongqing Daily for three consecutive days. These manuscripts were already very malicious, but Jia Weiying felt that the fire was not strong enough when reviewing them, and waved her pen to further exaggerate the fabrication, highlighting the titles.

For the past two years, since the Editor-in-Chief of the Chongqing Daily left for studies, Jia Weiying has actually been acting as the Editor-in-Chief. During the blooming period, she used this position to turn the Party newspaper into a battleground, publishing a large number of inflammatory news reports and articles in an attempt to disrupt the blooming steps and cause chaos. In the early stages of the blooming, Jia Weiying asked reporters to "uncover the whole story" in their reports, "bloom in all directions," and "create momentum." In order to stir up trouble, Jia Weiying disregarded the then-existing arrangements of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC and tried her best to ignite fires at the grassroots level. Since mid-May, the Chongqing Daily has continuously published a large number of malicious fire-starting news items such as "Factory and mine leaders are standing still" and "Cadres in government organs demand the creation of conditions for blooming and contending," causing tension and chaos in government organs, factories, schools, and other units for a time.

According to many people's revelations, she has always adopted a policy of superficial compliance and resistance to the leadership of the Municipal Committee in recent years, attempting to turn the Chongqing Daily into her independent kingdom. She often spread rumors among the newspaper's editors and reporters, undermining the leadership and prestige of the Municipal Committee. In the early stage of the "blooming and contending," the Chongqing Daily, under her control, broke away from the leadership of the Municipal Committee for a short period of time and made many serious mistakes. In May, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC had just criticized the Chongqing Daily for its news of igniting fires in government organs, and the next day the newspaper published news of igniting fires about factory and mine leaders standing still. Jia Weiying also repeatedly proposed topics, attempting to instigate reporters stationed in Chongqing from Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily, Sichuan Daily, and other units to write articles criticizing the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC. She also instructed the Chongqing Daily staff to use the method of reader letters to attack the Municipal Committee in the People's Daily.

Many people analyzed and exposed the historical roots of Jia Weiying's anti-Party stance in their speeches. She came from a landlord family, and her exploiting class ideology was not thoroughly reformed in the past revolutionary movements. During the rent reduction and deposit refund and the suppression of bandits and local bullies in 1950, she shielded her three counter-revolutionary brothers and was disciplined by the Party for this reason. After being disciplined, Jia Weiying not only did not repent, but also harbored resentment against the Party. Therefore, when the bourgeois right-wing elements rabidly attacked the Party, she finally colluded with the right-wing elements outside the Party from the inside out and embarked on the anti-Party road.

    充当右派向党进攻的急先锋
    贾唯英把持重庆日报疯狂反党
    她是一个出身剥削阶级始终没有彻底改造的野心分子
    据新华社讯　重庆新闻界8月底连续召开座谈会，揭露重庆日报副总编辑贾唯英反党的罪行。
    这个党龄近二十年的反党分子，由于怀有极端严重的资产阶级个人主义的野心，长期对党不满，在这次“鸣、放”期间竟利用所谓 “左叶事件”不经过中共重庆市委的同意，擅自以党报名义倡议、组织重庆的一部分记者召开抗议“左叶事件”的座谈会。贾唯英在这个座谈会上一开始就煽动说，类似“左叶”的人重庆也有，号召大家“有气出气”。在她的鼓动下，重庆日报、广播电台等单位的右派分子便在会上借题发挥，大放厥词。他们捏造、渲染了四十二件“事例”，借此攻击、谩骂中共重庆市委、市人民委员会等全市二十九个单位的所谓“左叶”。
    座谈会后，贾唯英一方面说会开得很好，另一方面指挥记者将会上经过渲染、捏造的“典型事实”加以集中，写成了长篇消息和长达四千多字的通讯，并发了社论，配了漫画，在重庆日报头版连续刊登三天。这些稿件本来就已写得很恶毒，但贾唯英在审稿时还嫌火气不够，又挥动大笔再渲染捏造，突出标题。
    重庆日报总编辑离职学习两年来，贾唯英实际上是代理总编辑的职务。在鸣放期中，她就利用这一地位把党报作为阵地，大量刊登煽风点火的消息和文章，企图打乱鸣放步骤，引起混乱。在鸣放初期，贾唯英要记者在报道中“大揭盖子”，“四面开花”，“造成声势”。为了搞乱局势，贾唯英不顾中共重庆市委当时的部署，极力设法在基层点火。5月中旬以来，重庆日报上连续出现了“厂矿领导按兵不动”、“机关干部要求创造鸣放条件”等大量恶毒放火的消息，造成机关、工厂、学校等单位一度紧张混乱。
    据许多人的揭发，她几年来对市委的领导一直是采取阳奉阴违和抗拒态度，企图把重庆日报变成她的独立王国。她经常在报社采编人员中散播流言蜚语，破坏市委的领导威信。在“鸣、放”初期，重庆日报在她的把持下，在一个短时期内脱离了市委的领导，犯了不少严重的错误。5月份，中共重庆市委刚批评了重庆日报对机关点火的消息，在第二天报上又出现了厂矿领导按兵不动的点火消息。贾唯英还不止一次地出题目，企图煽动新华社、人民日报、四川日报等单位驻重庆的记者写稿批评中共重庆市委。她还指示重庆日报工作人员用读者投书办法在人民日报上对市委进行攻击。
    许多人在发言中分析、揭露了贾唯英反党的历史根源。她出身于大地主家庭，剥削阶级思想在历次革命运动中没有得到彻底的改造。在1950年减租退押、清匪反霸时期，她曾包庇她的三个反革命兄弟，并因此受到党的纪律处分。贾唯英在受到处分后不但没有痛改前非，反而对党怀恨在心。因此，当资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，她终于与党外右派分子里应外合，走上了反党的道路。
