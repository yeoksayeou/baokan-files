    Crush the Conspiracy of the Bourgeois Sociological Restoration
    Comrade Pan Zinian’s Speech at the Symposium of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences
    (Our Newspaper) On August 29th, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium to criticize the right-wing elements' conspiracy to restore bourgeois sociology. The deputy director of the department, Pan Zinian, made a speech at the meeting, as follows:
    In July this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences invited a group of scientists to hold a symposium to criticize the anti-socialist scientific program put forward by the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Over the past month or so, with the gradual deepening of the anti-rightist struggle, more materials have been revealed in various aspects, further proving that before this program was published, the right-wing elements had already carried out many anti-Party and anti-socialist activities in the scientific community. The third part of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-socialist scientific program specifically addresses issues in the field of social sciences. In fact, the right-wing elements in the social sciences field had already been acting according to the ideas in this program. They took advantage of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the Communist Party's rectification campaign to issue calls for the "restoration" of old sociology, old economics, old political science, old law, etc., attempting to use these slogans to organize intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the Party, dissatisfied with the socialist system, nostalgic for the capitalist system, and resistant to ideological remolding, and also attempted to lead inexperienced youth onto the wrong path. Their purpose was to plot the restoration of bourgeois social science, to use the bourgeois world view to oppose the proletarian world view, and to use bourgeois social and political thought to guide our national work; their attack was directly aimed at Marxism-Leninism, at the fundamental system of our country, and at the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party. This is a sharp class struggle in politics and ideology, and all patriotic, socialist-supporting philosophy and social science workers must rise up to fight.
    The main purpose of this symposium, which begins today, is to expose and criticize the conspiracy of the right-wing elements to restore bourgeois sociology. The exposure and criticism of the right-wing's activities in this regard has already begun in relevant units, especially at the Renmin University of China, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and the Labor Cadre School, where the reactionary political faces of right-wing elements such as Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, and Li Jinghan have been exposed. Facts have proved that the activities of the bourgeois right-wing in this regard have been premeditated for a long time, with plans, steps, and a program. In February this year, Fei Xiaotong's article published in Wenhui Daily entitled "A Few Words on Sociology" already promoted the reactionary program of the right-wing's attempt to restore bourgeois sociology under the cover of many "oblique strokes." Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, Li Jinghan and others also put forward the proposition of "restoring" bourgeois sociology in various meetings and various newspapers and periodicals. They slandered our national work, saying that many of our national tasks were carried out without investigation and research, and even groundlessly said that the national census in 1953 was unreliable. They said that Marxist scientific research could not solve problems and could not convince people; they attacked the adjustment of departments and teaching reform, attempting to stir up dissatisfaction with the Party and the state among intellectuals. They peddled Malthus's reactionary population theory in disguise; they boasted about their set of so-called "social investigations" that lacked class analysis and distorted reality, and tried their best to whitewash the thoroughly bankrupt bourgeois sociology. In the name of academic research, they provoked and exaggerated contradictions in various aspects, using them to attack the Communist Party and socialism. The so-called Jiangcun investigation conducted by Fei Xiaotong not long ago and the so-called Beijing suburban investigation conducted by Li Jinghan have proved this point. They actively engaged in activities in a concealed way through collusion, gatherings, and dinners, and also carried out work in Shanghai, Nanjing and other places.
    In April this year, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in accordance with the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," invited Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, Li Jinghan, and several other gentlemen who had studied sociology in the past to a symposium. Our starting point at that time was: in scientific research, Marxists and those who hold bourgeois academic views can conduct free discussions; bourgeois sociology must be criticized, and in order to criticize it, it is necessary to conduct some research on it; at the same time, we also need to organize some forces to conduct investigations and research on various social problems. At that time, the reactionary political faces of right-wing elements such as Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, and Li Jinghan had not yet been exposed. We thought that after seven or eight years of ideological remolding, their positions should have changed somewhat, and they could do some work for the people in this regard, and could also better continue to remold themselves in their work. Therefore, it was decided at that time that they should nominate a few people to form a preparatory group to deliberate on establishing a social problems research working committee under the department at an appropriate time. Subsequent facts proved that what these right-wing elements were plotting was something completely different, and they were not interested in such a preparatory group. Harboring ulterior motives, they immediately seized this opportunity to engage in vigorous activities. Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily first published reports with ulterior motives, saying that we were preparing to establish a "Sociology Working Committee"! On June 9th, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, Li Jinghan and others held a meeting at Chen Da's home, completely disregarding the instructions of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They actually decided at the meeting to establish a "Sociology Working Committee" and nominated Chen Da as the director; they even far exceeded the scope of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' authority, making decisions to establish sociology departments in several universities, to "unite and contact former colleagues in the sociology field," to establish a sociological society, and to establish branches in various places, and so on. According to their decisions at the meeting, in addition to the Academy of Sciences, they also wanted to establish their so-called research bases at Renmin University, the Labor Cadre School, and the Central Institute for Nationalities, so that the research work on population issues, labor issues, agricultural and peasant life issues, urban construction issues, and ethnic issues would be controlled by the old sociologists. Obviously, these arrogant decisions made at this meeting were not for academic research, but to seize the ideological front of Marxism in scientific research institutions, universities, and even in all aspects of national life.
    In scientific research work, we must continue to unswervingly implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and continue to adhere to the policy of mobilizing all positive forces to serve socialist construction. Among those who studied old sociology in our country in the past, many right-wing elements emerged, which is inseparable from the extreme reactionariness of this science. Bourgeois sociology is completely anti-Marxist and anti-scientific, and we must negate it in principle. However, those who have studied sociology in the past, after initial ideological remolding, can still contribute their useful knowledge and abilities to the cause of socialist construction as long as they can stand on the people's stand and on the stand of supporting socialism. However, we must resolutely struggle against the anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing elements, and we must thoroughly crush the conspiracy of the bourgeois right-wing elements to restore bourgeois sociology to oppose Marxism, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and oppose socialism.

    粉碎资产阶级社会学复辟的阴谋
    潘梓年在哲学社会科学部座谈会上的发言
    本报讯  8月29日，中国科学院哲学社会科学部举行座谈会，批判右派分子妄图复辟资产阶级社会学的阴谋，这个部的副主任潘梓年在会上做了发言，文如下：
    中国科学院在今年7月间，曾经邀请一部分科学家举行座谈会，对章罗联盟提出的反社会主义的科学纲领进行批判。一个多月来。随着反右派斗争的逐步深入，各方面继续揭发了很多材料，进一步证明，早在这个纲领发表以前，右派分子已经在科学界进行了很多反党反社会主义的勾当。章罗联盟的反社会主义的科学纲领的第三部分是专门讲社会科学方面的问题的，社会科学界中的右派分子其实早已按照这个纲领中的思想进行活动了，他们利用中国共产党提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针和共产党实行整风的机会，发出了“恢复”旧社会学、旧经济学、旧政治学、旧法学等等的叫嚣，企图在这种口号下把对党不满、对社会主义制度不满、怀念资本主义制度、抗拒思想改造的知识分子组织起来，并且企图引导缺乏经验的青年走上错误的道路。他们的目的是图谋资产阶级社会科学复辟，用资产阶级的世界观来反对无产阶级的世界观，用资产阶级的社会政治思想来指导我们的国家工作；他们进攻的矛头直接指向马克思列宁主义、指向我们国家的根本制度、指向工人阶级及其先锋队共产党。这是一场政治上、思想上尖锐的阶级斗争，一切真正爱国的、拥护社会主义的哲学社会科学工作者必须起来战斗。
    今天开始的这个座谈会，主要的目的是揭露和批判右派分子企图使资产阶级社会学复辟的阴谋活动。对右派这方面活动的揭露和批判，已经在各有关单位开始进行，特别在中国人民大学、中央民族学院、劳动干部校学，已经揭露了右派分子费孝通、吴景超、陈达、李景汉等人的反动政治面目。事实证明，资产阶级右派在这方面的活动，是蓄谋已久，有计划、有步骤、有纲领的。今年2月，费孝通在文汇报上发表的题为“关于社会学，说几句话”的那篇文章，就已经在许多“曲笔”的掩护下面宣传着右派图谋资产阶级社会学复辟的反动纲领。吴景超、陈达、李景汉等人也在各种会议上面和各种报刊上面提出“恢复”资产阶级社会学的主张。他们诬蔑我们的国家工作，把我们的许多国家工作说成是没有经过调查研究的，甚至毫无根据说，1953年的全国人口普查是靠不住的。他们把马克思主义的科学研究说成不能解决问题，不能说服人；他们攻击院系调整和教学改革，企图在知识分子中煽起对党和国家的不满。他们改头换面地贩卖马尔萨斯的反动的人口理论；他们吹嘘他们那一套没有阶级分析的、歪曲实际的所谓“社会调查”，极力为已经彻底破产的资产阶级社会学涂脂抹粉。他们在学术研究的名义下，挑拨、夸大各方面的矛盾，用来向共产党、向社会主义进攻。在不久以前费孝通所进行的所谓江村调查和李景汉所进行的所谓北京郊区调查就已证明了这一点。他们隐蔽地用串联、集会、请吃饭等方式积极活动，并且向上海、南京等地开展工作。
    今年4月间，中国科学院哲学社会科学部根据党的“百家争鸣”方针，曾邀请吴景超、陈达、李景汉以及其他几位过去研究社会学的先生们座谈，我们当时的出发点是：在科学研究中，马克思主义者和抱着资产阶级学术观点的人之间可以进行自由讨论；资产阶级社会学必须批判，为了批判就需要对它进行一些研究；同时，我们也需要组织一些力量来进行各种社会问题的调查研究。当时右派分子费孝通、吴景超、陈达、李景汉等人的反动政治面目还没有暴露，我们以为他们经过七八年来的思想改造，立场应该已有所改变，可以在这方面为人民做些工作，并且在工作中还可以更好的继续改造自己。所以当时曾决定要他们推出几个人组成一个筹备小组来酝酿，在适当时期，在学部下面成立一个社会问题研究工作委员会。以后的事实证明，这些右派分子所图谋的完全是另外一回事，这样一个筹备小组他们是不感兴趣的。他们居心叵测，立即抓住这个机会就大肆活动，文汇报和光明日报首先发表了别有用心的报道，说我们在筹备建立什么“社会学工作委员会”了！6月9日，费孝通、吴景超、陈达、李景汉等人在陈达家里举行会议，完全不顾中国科学院哲学社会科学部的指示，竟在会上决定成立“社会学工作委员会”，推出了陈达为主任；甚至远远超出中国科学院职权的范围，作出要在若干大学设立社会学系，要“团结和联系原来社会学界同人”，成立社会学会，并要在各地设立分会等等的决定。按照他们在会议上的决定，除了在科学院外，他们还要在人民大学、劳动干部学校、中央民族学院建立他们的所谓调查研究工作的据点，使关于人口问题、劳动问题、农业与农民生活问题、城市建设问题、民族问题的调查研究工作都掌握在旧社会学者的手里，很明显的，这个会议作出来的这些狂妄的决定，决不是为了什么学术研究，而是要在科学研究机构中、高等学校中以至国家生活的各个方面，夺取马克思主义的思想阵地。
    在科学研究工作中，我们今后仍然要坚定不移地贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，仍然要坚持调动一切积极力量为社会主义建设服务的方针。在我国过去学过旧社会学的人当中出了不少右派分子，这是同这门科学的极端反动性分不开的。资产阶级社会学，彻头彻尾是反马克思主义的、反科学的，我们必须在原则上予以否定。但是，过去学过社会学的人，经过初步的思想改造以后，只要能够站在人民的立场、站在拥护社会主义的立场，仍然可以对社会主义建设事业贡献自己有用的知识和能力。但是，我们必须和反党反社会主义的右派分子坚决进行斗争，必须彻底粉碎资产阶级右派企图使资产阶级社会学复辟来反对马克思主义、反对共产党领导、反对社会主义的阴谋。
