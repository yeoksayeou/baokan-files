　　Shandan Qijiadian Reservoir
　　This is the medium-sized reservoir, Shandan Qijiadian Reservoir, built by farmers in Shandan and Zhangye counties, Gansu Province, under the leadership and with the assistance of the Party and the government. This reservoir can not only provide timely irrigation for more than 30,000 mu of farmland in the lower reaches of the Shandan River; at the same time, 60,000 to 70,000 mu of wasteland there can also be reclaimed. According to preliminary estimates, the wasteland reclaimed in the future can produce grain worth about one million yuan for the country every year. Photo by Liu Qi

　　山丹祁家店水库
    这是甘肃省山丹和张掖两县农民，在党和政府的领导和资助下，修建起来的中型水库——山丹祁家店水库。这个水库不仅可以使山丹河下游的三万多亩农田得到及时的灌溉；同时，那里的六、七万亩荒地也可以开垦出来。据初步估计，将来开垦出来的荒地，每年可以为国家生产价值一百万元左右的粮食。  刘奇摄
