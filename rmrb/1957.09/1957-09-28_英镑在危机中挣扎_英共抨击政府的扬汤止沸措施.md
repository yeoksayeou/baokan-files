Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th. The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement today on the British economic crisis, saying that the Conservative government's recent measures are aimed at lowering the living standards of the people.

Regarding the government's claim that the instability of the pound sterling is caused by the movement demanding increased wages, the statement said: "This is a lie. Because the Conservative government has implemented policies that directly and indirectly reduce the purchasing power of the pound sterling within Britain since it came to power, the pound sterling has been under pressure from the American and West German governments and has become a common target for speculators."

The statement pointed out, "The government's military expenditure for the Cold War is greater per capita than any other country in Europe."

The statement said: "The stagnation of British production in recent months is not due to workers slacking off, but to unemployment and reduced working hours caused by credit tightening."

The statement called on the Labour Party to oppose the government's policies and put forward a working-class policy to deal with Britain's problems, which should include ending credit tightening, increasing wages, reducing profits, abolishing the rent bill, immediately increasing pensions, nationalizing joint-stock banks, large insurance companies, the machinery and chemical industries, and reducing military spending.

The statement called on the people to take united action to force a general election and overthrow the Conservative government.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th. The British government is trying its best to save the position of the pound sterling, which is in crisis.

The measures that the British government has taken or is taking for this purpose include: issuing statements expressing its determination to maintain the current exchange rate of the pound sterling, and stating that Britain's trade position is stable; announcing the decision to use the $500 million credit provided by the US Export-Import Bank last year; appealing to the United States and the Commonwealth countries for assistance; raising bank interest rates; reducing investment in public and private production units; and taking strict measures to suppress workers' demands for wage increases.

Although these emergency measures have slightly eased the pressure on the pound sterling, they have not changed the basic financial situation. Gold and dollar reserves are only slightly more than the safe amount of two billion US dollars.

On the other hand, these emergency measures by the British government have sharpened domestic labor-capital relations, as they are likely to slow down production, increase unemployment, and lower people's living standards. Many trade unions, including the right-wing National Union of Municipal and General Workers, have sharply criticized the government's measures. (Attached picture)

    英镑在危机中挣扎
    英共抨击政府的扬汤止沸措施
    新华社伦敦26日电　英国共产党政治委员会今天就英国经济危机发表声明说，保守党政府最近的措施目的在于降低人民的生活水平。
    关于政府所谓英镑地位动摇是由要求增加工资的运动造成的说法，声明说：“这是谎话。由于保守党政府执政以来执行了直接和间接地降低英镑在英国国内的购买力的政策，英镑遭到了美国政府和西德政府的压力，成了投机商的普遍对象。”
    声明指出，“政府为进行冷战使（英国的）军费开支按每人计算大于欧洲任何国家。”
    声明说：“最近几个月英国生产的停滞不是由于工人工作松懈，而是由于信贷紧缩引起了失业和工时缩短。”
    声明要求工党反对政府政策，提出工人阶级的政策来处理英国的问题，这个政策应该包括结束信贷紧缩，增加工资，减少利润，废除房租法案，立即增加养老金，把股份银行、大保险公司、机械和化学工业国有化，并且减少军备开支。
    声明要求人民采取一致行动来迫使举行大选，推翻保守党政府。
    据新华社伦敦26日电　英国政府正在竭力设法挽救处在危机中的英镑地位。
    英国政府为此目的已经采取或正在采取的措施包括：发表声明表示决心保持英镑目前的汇率，申明英国贸易地位稳固；宣布决定动用去年谈妥的由美国进出口银行贷予的五亿美元的信贷；吁请美国以及英联邦国家予以帮助；提高银行利率；减少在公共和私人生产单位中的投资；采取严厉措施压制工人的提高工资的要求。
    这些紧急措施虽然使英镑所受压力稍趋缓和，但是并没有改变基本金融状况。黄金和美元储备只比安全数额二十亿美元稍微多一点。
    英国政府这些紧急措施在另一方面已经使国内的劳资关系尖锐化了，因为它们有可能使生产放慢，增加失业人口和降低人民的生活水平。许多工会、包括右翼的全国市政与普通工人工会在内都尖锐地批评了政府的措施。（附图片）
