Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 3rd: The ancient cultural city of Xi'an has now become an emerging center of higher education.

　　Stepping out of the new urban area of Xi'an, if you look from the famous Tang Dynasty Big Goose Pagoda in the southern suburbs, you can see rows of new building complexes unfolding in the thick green clusters on the east and west wings, stretching intermittently for six kilometers. The sixteen universities in the Xi'an area are mainly gathered here. The state is cultivating more than 24,000 college students here, studying more than 100 professional courses, including electronic computers, design and manufacture of various precision machines, petroleum exploration, coal geology, bridges, railways, medicine, education, literature, and art, etc.

　　Before liberation, Xi'an's cultural and educational undertakings were extremely declining, with only three institutions of higher learning, with simple and crude school buildings and equipment, and a pitiful number of teachers, with a total of only more than 2,000 students. In the eight years since liberation, with the vigorous development of economic construction in the Xi'an area, the number of newly built institutions of higher learning has also increased rapidly. The newly built and expanded building area totals more than 6 million square meters, covering an area of 420 hectares. The existing books in the schools have exceeded more than one million volumes, with thousands of periodicals and magazines, and the teaching and experimental equipment has generally increased by ten to twenty times. Xi'an Medical College, which had only 61 beds before liberation, now has a total of 1,174 beds. In the newly built school buildings in the southern suburbs, several student practice rooms in the pathological anatomy teaching and research section of this medical college already have many new surgical and research equipment. The Geology Department of Northwest University did not even have a "polarizing microscope" in the past. Teachers and students often had to go to the Northwest Institute of Technology, 25 kilometers away from Xi'an, to borrow it. Now there are 41 such microscopes.

　　In the eleven years before liberation, the total number of graduates from Xi'an universities was only more than 2,000. In the eight years since liberation, Xi'an universities have trained nearly 10,000 construction talents for the country. The academic performance of the students trained is also getting better year by year. For example, when Xi'an Normal College was just established in 1953, students with excellent grades accounted for only 0.11% of the total number of students in the school, but in 1956, students with excellent grades increased to 14.08%. Among the graduates of this school since liberation, 23 have been elected as advanced educational workers in Shaanxi Province because of their outstanding teaching achievements. This year's students at the Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering can now engage in the design of large-scale transformer factories and high-voltage switch factories with very high technical standards. Every senior student at Xi'an Medical College can now skillfully perform appendectomy, which was only a job that attending physicians were qualified for before liberation. Zhu Longyu, a representative of the national advanced producers' conference who creatively applied electro-acupuncture therapy, is a graduate of this school after liberation.

　　Since the teaching reform in 1952, teachers in various universities in Xi'an have generally and conscientiously studied the advanced Soviet teaching experience. They have used winter and summer vacations and spare time to investigate and collect materials in various places to enrich the content of textbooks and have opened many new majors and new courses. This is in sharp contrast to the incomplete courses before liberation, and the fact that some teachers did not revise their lecture notes for many years. In addition, scientific research work, which is closely related to teaching, has also been vigorously launched in various schools recently. At present, 70% of the teachers at Northwest University are participating in scientific research work. Last year, they completed more than 130 scientific research topics. Many famous professors, such as Hou Zonglian who studies physiology and Yue Jieheng who studies physics, have resumed the research work that was interrupted for a long time before liberation.

### 西安已成为新兴高等教育事业中心  两万四千多名大学生学习着一百多个专业课程

    西安已成为新兴高等教育事业中心
    两万四千多名大学生学习着一百多个专业课程
    据新华社西安3日电　文化古城西安现在已成为新兴高等教育事业中心。
    走出西安城外新市区，在南郊著名的唐代大雁塔上极目眺望，只见东西两翼的浓绿丛中，展开一列一列新的建筑群，断续绵延达六公里长。西安地区的十六所高等学校主要就荟萃于此。国家在这里正培养着两万四千多名大学生，他们学习着一百多个专业课程，其中有电子计算机、各种精密机器的设计和制造，石油勘察，煤炭地质、桥梁、铁路、医药、教育、文学和艺术等等。
    解放前，西安的文教事业极端雕零，仅有三所高等学校，校舍设备简陋不堪，教师少得可怜，全部学生只有二千多名。解放后，八年来，随着西安地区经济建设的蓬勃发展，新建的高等学校的数量也飞速地增加了，新建和扩建的房屋面积共达六千多万平方公尺，占地四百二十公顷。各校现有的图书已超过一百多万册，期刊杂志数千种，教学实验设备普遍地增加了一二十倍。解放前只有六十一张病床的西安医学院，目前共设有一千一百七十四张病床；这个医学院如今在南郊外新建的校舍里，病理解剖教研组的几个学生实习室中，已经有许多新式的手术和研究设备。西北大学地质系过去连“偏光显微镜”也没有，师生们经常要跑到离西安二十五公里的西北工学院去借用，现在这种显微镜已经有四十一架了。
    解放前十一年间，西安市高等学校毕业生总共不过二千多人。解放八年来，西安高等学校就为国家培养了近一万名的建设人才。培养出的学生的学业成绩，也是一年比一年好。如西安师范学院1953年度刚成立时，优等成绩的学生才占全校学生的0.11％，到1956年度优等成绩的学生就增加到14.08％。这个学校解放后历届毕业生中，有二十三人因为教学成绩出色，当选陕西省先进教育工作者。西安建筑工程学院的今年学生，已能从事技术标准很高的大型变压器厂和高压开关厂等设计。西安医学院现在的每个高年级学生都能熟练地作阑尾炎切除手术，这在解放前是主治医师才胜任的工作。创造性运用电针疗法的全国先进生产者代表会议的代表朱龙玉，就是这个学校解放后的毕业生。
    1952年教学改革以来，西安各高等学校教师普遍认真学习了苏联先进教学经验，他们利用寒暑假和课余时间，到各处调查考察，收集资料丰富了教材内容，开设了许多新专业和新课程，这和解放前课程残缺不全，有些教师多年也不修改讲义的情况成了鲜明的对照。此外，同教学有密切关系的科学研究工作，最近也已在各校蓬勃展开。目前，西北大学参加科学研究工作的教师占70％。去年，他们共完成了一百三十多个科学研究题目。许多著名教授如研究生理学的侯宗濂，研究物理学的岳劼恒等，都已恢复了解放前长期中断的研究工作。
