　　100,000 Tons of Meteors Fall Daily
    According to estimates by two Canadian scientists, approximately 200 million meteors visible to the naked eye enter the Earth's atmosphere every day, increasing the Earth's mass by about 100,000 tons.
    After recently studying and recording the occurrence of meteor showers and the brightness distribution of nearly 30,000 meteors, they discovered that the number of meteors with various brightness levels systematically increases and decreases. These differences are higher than previously imagined, proving that the number of faint meteors falling to Earth is greater than previously estimated. (Science)

　　每天有十万吨流星降落
    根据加拿大两位科学家估计，每天约有二亿个肉眼可见的流星冲入地球的大气中，使地球的质量增加了约十万吨。
    他们最近研究并记录了发生流星雨以及近三万颗流星亮度的分布状况后发现，具有各种亮度的流星数目是有系统地增减的。这些差数比以前所想像的要高，这证明了降落到地球上弱亮度的流星数目，比过去所估计的更多。    （科）
