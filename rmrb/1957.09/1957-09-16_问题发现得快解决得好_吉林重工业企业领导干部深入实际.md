　　Problems Discovered Quickly, Resolved Well
　　Leading Cadres of Jilin Heavy Industrial Enterprises Go Deep into Reality
    (Our newspaper Changchun 15th dispatch) Since the rectification campaign began in Jilin Province's heavy industrial enterprises, many leading cadres have frequently gone deep among the masses and into reality, promptly addressing the problems existing in practical work. The Party Committee members of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant stipulated that they would visit collective dormitories and family residences once a week, study the problems they learned about and solutions once a week, and spend three days a week going deep into workshops and departments. Many factories and mines have also established systems such as leading cadres going deep into mine pits and workshops in shifts with the work shifts at night, and conducting office work in their spare time.
    After leading cadres went deep into reality, they strengthened ties with the workers and masses, and promptly resolved many important issues. After Leng Yanquan, Director of the Shizuizi Mine Concentrator, went deep into the site, he and the workers studied and understood the key production problems of low concentrate grade and failure to complete the state plan for actual recovery rate for several months. After the Jilin Fertilizer Plant and other six units began the rectification campaign, the staff and workers raised more than 2,700 opinions on production, living, and leadership style, etc., and more than 2,500 of them have now been resolved. The Eighth Mechanical Installation Company's masses raised more than 1,000 opinions, which have also been dealt with promptly. Most enterprise leading cadres helped the staff and workers organize mutual aid savings societies, which were welcomed by the staff and workers.

　　问题发现得快解决得好
　　吉林重工业企业领导干部深入实际
    本报长春15日电  吉林省重工业企业开始整风以来，许多领导干部经常深入群众、深入实际，及时处理实际工作中存在的问题。吉林肥料厂的党委委员规定每周到集体宿舍和家属宿舍访问一次，每周研究一次所了解到的问题和解决办法，每周还要用三天的时间深入车间、科室。许多工厂、矿山还建立了领导干部晚上深入矿坑、车间轮流随班制度、业余办公制度等。
    领导干部深入实际以后，密切了与工人群众之间的联系，及时解决了许多重要问题。石嘴子矿选矿厂冷彦泉厂长深入现场以后，和工人一起研究了解几个月来精矿品位低、实收率完不成国家计划的生产关键问题。吉林肥料厂等六个单位开始整风以后，职工群众提出的有关生产、生活和领导作风等方面的意见二千七百多件，现在已经解决了二千五百多件。第八机械安装公司群众提出一千多件意见，也都得到及时处理。大部分企业领导干部帮助职工组织了互助储金会，受到职工的欢迎。
