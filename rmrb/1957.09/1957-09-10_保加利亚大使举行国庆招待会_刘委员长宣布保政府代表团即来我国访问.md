Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: Chairman Liu Shaoqi attended the National Day reception given by Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Mr. Negałkow, this evening.

In his speech at the grand reception, he announced that in a few days, a Bulgarian government delegation headed by Comrade Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, will come to China for a visit. He said that this visit will be a major event between our two countries and will certainly further deepen the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the peoples of our two countries.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the continuous development and consolidation of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Bulgarian people is not only conducive to the socialist construction of both countries, but also to strengthening the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the noble cause of world peace.

After talking about the great achievements made by the Bulgarian people in construction, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the People's Republic of Bulgaria has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and has made important contributions to maintaining European and world peace, developing friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and consolidating the great unity among socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people admire and are encouraged by these great achievements and contributions of the Bulgarian people.

Ambassador Negałkow spoke at the beginning of the reception, saying that the reason why the Bulgarian people have been able to achieve great success in construction is due to the support and assistance of various fraternal countries, first and foremost the unreserved and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union.

Negałkow said that the People's Republic of Bulgaria stands loyally in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and works actively. The policy of the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria towards peace, understanding, and friendship with all countries of different social systems, especially with the Balkan countries, stems from this fact. Our country has close political, economic, and cultural ties with the geographically distant People's Republic of China. There is a close socialist fraternal friendship between our two countries. The Bulgarian people have deep love and respect for the great Chinese people and are sincerely rejoiced by the historic achievements made by the Chinese people.

This evening, Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Li Fuchun, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Peng Zhen, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, and people from all walks of life in China, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to China, attended the reception.
