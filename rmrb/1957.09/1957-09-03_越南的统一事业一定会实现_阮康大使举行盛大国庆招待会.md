Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd.  Vietnamese Ambassador to China, Nguyen Khang, held a grand reception in Beijing this afternoon to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception and delivered a speech. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he extended heartfelt congratulations and high respect to the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said that for the past twelve years, the heroic Vietnamese people, under the guidance of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, have traversed a difficult and glorious path in establishing a peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic nation. In the short three years since the restoration of peace in Indochina, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have successfully healed the wounds of war. Especially in the past year, new achievements have been made in restoring and developing the national economy.

    Premier Zhou said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also working to fully implement the Geneva Accords. In order to realize the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding consultations between the North and South Vietnamese authorities on free nationwide elections, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals to the South Vietnamese authorities. However, with the support and connivance of the United States, the South Vietnamese authorities have repeatedly rejected the reasonable proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Premier Zhou said that the United States, as one of the participating countries in the Geneva Conference, in order to achieve its goal of long-term division of Vietnam to turn South Vietnam into its military base for aggression in Asia, disregarded its guarantee at the Geneva Conference not to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords. It has armed and trained the South Vietnamese army with a large number of weapons and military personnel, and is trying to link South Vietnam with the Manila aggressive bloc. As Ambassador Nguyen Khang pointed out, this conspiracy of sabotage by the United States has been severely condemned by the Vietnamese people and peace-loving people all over the world, and it will surely meet with shameful failure.

    Premier Zhou said that in foreign relations, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is developing and consolidating its friendly relations with socialist countries and Asian-African countries. The friendly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and its neighboring countries, Cambodia and Laos, are also developing.

    Premier Zhou said that President Ho Chi Minh's recent visit to many socialist countries is of great significance for consolidating and developing the solidarity among the fraternal socialist countries. President Ho Chi Minh's cordial talks with the party and government leaders of the socialist countries further strengthened the friendship, solidarity, and cooperation of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union.

    Premier Zhou also said that the people of China and Vietnam have a long-standing traditional friendship. After the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China, this fraternal and unbreakable friendship has been further consolidated and developed. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in all fields. We sincerely wish the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people even greater achievements in the cause of building their own country and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

    Ambassador Nguyen Khang spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that the Vietnamese people have made great achievements in building their own country, but the Vietnamese people will not forget that in half of their territory, their compatriots in the South are still living under dark fascist rule. The South Vietnamese authorities, supported by U.S. imperialism, are meticulously plotting to undermine the Geneva Accords, violating the urgent desire of all Vietnamese people to achieve national unification by peaceful and democratic means as stipulated by the Geneva Accords. U.S. imperialism is continuously shipping large quantities of weapons into South Vietnam and is turning South Vietnam into a U.S. imperialist colony and military base.

    Nguyen Khang said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always advocated the firm and correct implementation of the Geneva Accords. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly formally proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities that the two sides should hold consultations to discuss free elections in order to peacefully unify the country. Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote to the South Vietnamese regime on July 18, reiterating this correct position. On the contrary, the Southern authorities, at the instigation of U.S. imperialism, have issued unreasonable statements that evaded consultation and refused to establish normal relations between the northern and southern regions before the reunification of the motherland.

    The American interventionists and his followers, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, are being severely condemned by the people of Vietnam and peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world. Their conspiracy to prepare for war and permanently divide the territory of Vietnam will surely meet with shameful failure.

    Nguyen Khang said that the Vietnamese people have always received generous and selfless support from the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries in their struggle for national liberation, unification of the motherland, and peaceful construction. At the same time, the Vietnamese people have also received enthusiastic support from Asian-African countries and all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries in the world. Following the visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia in 1955, President Ho Chi Minh recently visited nine fraternal countries. At the same time, many delegations from fraternal countries have also visited Vietnam in recent years. All these friendly contacts have made beneficial contributions to consolidating and developing the unbreakable friendship and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and China. The victories achieved by the fraternal countries in socialist construction, especially China, our great neighbor, which has very close and long-standing relations with Vietnam in terms of history, economy, and culture, greatly encourage the Vietnamese people, thereby strengthening the Vietnamese people's confidence in the beautiful prospects of socialist construction in their country.

    Nguyen Khang finally said that under the wise guidance of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi

    越南的统一事业一定会实现
    阮康大使举行盛大国庆招待会
    新华社2日讯  越南驻华大使阮康今天下午在北京举行盛大招待会，庆祝越南民主共和国成立十二周年。
    周恩来总理出席了招待会并讲了话。他代表中国政府和中国人民向越南民主共和国政府和越南人民致以衷心的祝贺和崇高的敬意。他说，十二年来，英雄的越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，为建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主的国家经历了一条艰苦而光荣的道路。在印度支那的和平恢复以来的短短三年里，越南民主共和国政府和人民已经成功地医治了战争的创伤。特别是最近一年来，在恢复和发展国民经济方面取得了新的成就。
    周总理说，越南民主共和国也正在为彻底实现日内瓦协议而努力。为了实现日内瓦协议关于越南南北负责当局应该就全国自由普选进行协商的规定，越南民主共和国政府曾多次向南越当局提出合理的建议。但是，南越当局在美国的支持和纵容下，一再地拒绝越南民主共和国方面的合理建议。
    周总理说，作为日内瓦会议参加国之一的美国，为了达到长期分裂越南以便把南越变成它在亚洲进行侵略的军事基地的目的，不顾它在日内瓦会议上做过的不破坏日内瓦协议实施的保证，竟以大量武器和军事人员武装和训练南越军队，并且力图把南越同马尼拉侵略集团联系起来。正如大使同志所指出的，美国的这种阴谋破坏已经遭到越南人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的严厉谴责，它定会遭到可耻的失败。
    周总理说，在对外关系上，越南民主共和国正在发展和巩固着它同社会主义国家和亚非国家的友好关系。越南民主共和国同邻邦柬埔寨和老挝的友好关系，也正在发展中。
    周总理说，最近胡志明主席在许多社会主义国家的访问，对于巩固和发展各社会主义兄弟国家之间的团结有着重大的意义。胡志明主席同各社会主义国家的党政领导同志的亲切会谈，进一步加强了以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的友好、团结和合作。
    周总理还说，中越两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊，在越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国成立以后，这种兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊，获得了进一步的巩固和发展。中国人民对越南人民在各方面所获得的巨大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。我们衷心地预祝今后越南民主共和国和越南人民，在建设自己的祖国和维护亚洲和世界和平的事业中日益取得更多更大的成就。
    阮康大使在招待会开始的时候讲了话。他说，越南人民在建设自己祖国的事业中已经取得了巨大的成就，但是，越南人民不会忘记，目前在一半的国土上，他们在南方的同胞还正生活在黑暗的法西斯统治下。获得美帝国主义支撑的越南南方当局正在处心积虑地阴谋破坏日内瓦协议，违背全体越南人民要求按照日内瓦协议所规定的和平与民主方法实现国家统一的迫切愿望。美帝国主义接连不断地把大批武器运进越南南方，并正在把越南南方变成为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。
    阮康说，越南民主共和国政府始终主张坚决正确履行日内瓦协议。越南民主共和国政府曾经多次正式向越南南方当局提出双方进行协商，讨论自由普选以便和平统一国家的建议。越南民主共和国总理范文同7月18日写信给南越政权再次表明了这个正确的立场。相反地，南方当局在美帝国主义的唆使下已发表逃避协商并且拒绝在祖国未获得统一之前建立北南两个地区正常关系的无理声明。
    美国干涉者和他的追随者吴庭艳之流正遭到越南全国人民和世界上爱好和平、坚持正义人们的严厉谴责。他们企图准备战争并长期分割越南领土的阴谋，一定会遭到可耻的失败。
    阮康说，越南人民在民族解放，统一祖国和从事和平建设的斗争中，一向得到苏联、中国以及其他社会主义国家慷慨无私的支援。同时，越南人民也得到亚非国家和世界上爱好和平与坚持正义的各个国家的热烈支持。紧接着1955年越南民主共和国政府代表团访问苏联、中国和蒙古之后，胡志明主席最近又访问了九个兄弟国家，同时，近几年来各兄弟国家也派了不少代表团到越南访问。所有这些友好的接触，都对巩固和发展以苏联、中国为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的友谊和团结作出有益的贡献。各个兄弟国家在社会主义建设中所取得的胜利，特别是中国，它是我们伟大的邻邦，它和越南不论在历史、经济和文化等方面都有着非常密切和悠久的关系，它所取得的光辉胜利，大大地鼓舞着越南人民，从而使越南人民对自己的祖国从事社会主义建设的美好远景愈益加强了信心。
    阮康最后说，在越南劳动党和以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府的英明领导下，越南人民不断地努力奋斗，同时又得到世界爱好和平的各国和人民的同情和支持，以和平和民主方式来达到越南的统一的斗争事业一定会实现。
    出席招待会的，还有副总理贺龙、薄一波，副委员长李济深、彭真，最高人民法院院长董必武，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长张闻天和社会各方面的人士，以及各国驻中国的使节和外交官员。
    参加亚洲电影周的十多个国家的著名电影演员也出席了招待会。
