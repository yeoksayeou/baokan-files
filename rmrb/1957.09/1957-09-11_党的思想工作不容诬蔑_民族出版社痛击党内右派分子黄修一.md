The Party's Ideological Work Cannot Be Slandered
Nationalities Publishing House Scathingly Criticizes Rightist Elements Within the Party, Huang Xiuyi

(Our Dispatch) The staff of the Nationalities Publishing House have held a series of symposiums in recent days to expose and criticize the anti-Party words and deeds of Huang Xiuyi, a rightist element within the Party and the director of the "Nationalities Pictorial" editorial office.

Since the Party began its rectification campaign, Huang Xiuyi has launched vicious attacks against the Party organization. With an attitude of negating everything, he has obliterated the work achievements of the Nationalities Publishing House over the past few years, deliberately exaggerating the errors and accidents in publishing, portraying the publishing house as a completely dark and chaotic "mess," and slandering the publishing house's work summary as a "stereotyped formula" because "achievements are primary, and shortcomings are secondary." He also viciously attacked the Party's political and ideological work, saying, "We emphasize the use of socialist, communist, and Marxist-Leninist thought to educate ourselves and others, but our errors and accidents have never decreased," and "In the past, the books published by the Commercial Press did not have a single typo, and Wang Yunwu did not engage in ideological work." He "warned" the Party organization not to regard ideological work as a "panacea."

Huang Xiuyi also negated the guidelines and tasks for the Nationalities Pictorial stipulated by the Party Group of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, saying that the long-term inability of the Nationalities Pictorial to break away from the problems of formulaic and conceptual writing was caused by its guidelines and tasks. He proclaimed: "To run the pictorial well, a ten-thousand-word letter must be sent to the Central Committee."

At the symposium, comrades refuted Huang Xiuyi's fallacies with reason and unanimously pointed out that he had completely lost the standpoint of a Communist Party member and had become a spokesperson for the bourgeois rightists within the Party. Although Huang Xiuyi had to lower his head and admit defeat when everyone refuted his bourgeois reactionary views in a just and stern manner, he still refused to examine and confess his reactionary words and deeds and openly declared that he was willing to be a "living textbook."

　　党的思想工作不容诬蔑
    民族出版社痛击党内右派分子黄修一
    本报讯　民族出版社的工作人员连日举行座谈会，揭露和批判党内右派分子、“民族画报”编辑室主任黄修一的反党言行。
    党开始整风以后，黄修一就向党组织进行了恶毒的进攻。他用否定一切的态度，抹煞民族出版社几年来的工作成绩，故意夸大出书差错事故，把出版社说成是漆黑一团的“烂摊子”，污蔑出版社工作总结“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”是刻版公式。他还恶毒地攻击党的政治思想工作，说“我们最强调用社会主义、共产主义、马列主义的思想教育自己和教育别人，但是我们的差错事故始终没有减少”，“过去商务印书馆出的书没有一个错字，人家王云五也没有作思想工作”。他“警告”党组织不要把思想工作当作“万应灵丹”。
    黄修一还否定民族事务委员会党组规定的民族画报的方针任务，说民族画报长期不能摆脱公式化、概念化的毛病是由它的方针任务造成的。他扬言：“要办好画报，非向中央上万言书不可”。
    在座谈会上，同志们据理驳斥了黄修一的谬论，并一致指出他已经完全丧失了共产党员的立场，变成了资产阶级右派在党内的代言人。在大家义正词严地把他的资产阶级反动观点驳得体无完肤的情况下，黄修一虽然不得不低头认输，但对他的反动言行，仍拒不检查交代，并公然宣称愿当“活教材”。
