    Summer Vacation Diary
    He Wei
    This summer vacation is the most memorable one for junior high school graduate Ding Haihua. There are two paths before him: either pass the high school entrance exam and continue his student life, or respond to the solemn call to "go to the countryside and become the first generation of educated farmers." If he takes the latter path, then this summer vacation will be his last since entering school.
    After taking the high school entrance exam, during the tense days of waiting for the results to be announced, there were a few days when the weather was at its hottest this summer. Ding Haihua often took a book and went out before dawn. Sometimes he went to chat with classmates, but more often he strolled alone along the gravel path by the pond in the nearby park; or he hid in a corner deep in the woods to ponder, using this to kill time. When he encountered a couple sitting side by side on a dark green bench whispering to each other, he shook his head and walked away. Worry filled his heart like a rising tide. A pile of serious life questions churned in the heart of the sixteen-year-old boy: How can one correctly treat labor and love? What is true happiness? Like this, he dragged his tired body home very late at night, falling asleep as soon as he lay down.
    The old grandmother living in the adjoining room always muttered when she heard this: This summer, the second son Haihua has been busy with school exams since the summer vacation started, and the eldest daughter Shuhua at the university is so busy that she has simply forgotten about the summer vacation! One afternoon, neighbor Teacher Meng from number eleven told the old lady that a group of right-wing elements were setting fires everywhere,妄想爬到人民头上, trying to drag China back to the dark ages.
    "No, it can't be done!" Teacher Meng suddenly slammed his hand on the table. "Absolutely not!" He slammed his hand again heavily, making the teapot and cups on the table jump. Indeed, even the usually calm and collected Teacher Meng was angry. Then he opened the newspaper and began to read the news: "Listen to this passage: 'Communist Youth League member Ding Shuhua stood firm in the face of the great storm, defended the great cause of the socialist motherland, and launched a resolute struggle against right-wing elements!'" Teacher Meng pushed his old spectacles up the bridge of his nose and couldn't help but exclaim, "Several university students, facing more than 3,000 big-character posters and more than 200 blackboard newspapers from right-wing elements, engaged in a head-on, reasoned battle. Your daughter is truly brave!"
    "Is it true? Is Shuhua's story in the newspaper? No wonder this child hasn't come home for more than a month!" Although the old lady didn't fully understand what was in the newspaper, she seemed to understand a lot more.
    Soon, even this alley seemed to have changed. One night, Ding Haihua exceptionally stayed home and didn't go out. He moved a small bamboo stool and took a palm-leaf fan to the entrance of the alley to cool off. In that narrow open space, there were several strangers he had never seen before. He remembered what his grandmother said at the dinner table, that recently several families in their alley had guests from afar: some were returning for a short stay during their vacations, some were coming to pick up their families to settle down in other places, and some had been away for several years participating in construction and had returned home to visit their relatives. Listen, what are they talking about so vividly!
    So he began to pay attention: it turned out that the tall man from number nine was a geological exploration team member from Xinjiang, very familiar with the story of the birth of the Karamay oil city. He constantly talked about his adventurous experience crossing the Gobi Desert, and when he spoke of the dangers, it was as if he had brought half the Gobi Desert with him, with flying sand and rocks, making the children stare in amazement. The civil engineering student from number twelve had just returned from an internship at the Yangtze River Bridge. When a few old men heard that the bridge spanned between the south and the north like a rainbow, that the bridge body was erected above the turbulent Yangtze River, and that the top of the bridge was higher than the 24-story International Hotel in Shanghai, they were all speechless in amazement. A relative from number seven worked as a train conductor on the railway. For several years, he had traveled all over the north and south on many newly built railway lines. Every time he came home, he would casually talk about what he had seen and heard along the way, or give a few railway names, explaining their starting and ending points, which would make the neighbors listen with fascination.
    Ah! On a star-lit midsummer night, after a day of hard work, fanning oneself and enjoying the cool, listening to visitors from all directions telling their fresh life experiences: it was a real-life fairy tale, a dreamlike miracle, everywhere were amazing news of socialist construction, replacing the ancient myths and legends of the past, greatly enriching the chatting life during the summer night cool-off. Is there anything more inspiring than this?
    Junior high school graduate Ding Haihua's eyes lit up: those people from various different work positions opened up the most fascinating page of life for him. First, he didn't realize that this small alley, so common in Shanghai, had such a close relationship with the entire socialist construction. Then he felt that the world of life was so vast, and yet he was hiding in the corner of the park thinking about so-called personal prospects, and couldn't help but blush secretly. "So silly, so silly!" he said to himself.
    Blushing easily was a habit of Ding Haihua. When he met Luo Yun, the female tractor driver from a state-owned farm in Northeast China at number two, the more he wanted to overcome this habit of blushing, the more difficult it was to overcome. This "northern girl" - as people affectionately called her - was the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch on the state-owned farm and a well-known production expert in the local area. She looked no more than three or four years older than Ding Haihua, but she wasn't polite to Ding Haihua at all. Once, the old grandmother worried that her little grandson would get sick from being unable to pass the high school entrance exam. When the female tractor driver heard this, she laughed loudly:
    "Hey, Ding Haihua is worth a calf, grandma!"
    Ding Haihua's face flushed a little. To be honest, he was a little afraid of her. And this somewhat wild "northern girl" seemed to tease him even more when she saw him blush. For example, she heard that Ding Haihua was struggling a lot internally about going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, so she kept arguing with him, not giving him any leeway. That time, Ding Haihua was really about to get angry. But Luo Yun suddenly held Ding Haihua's hand tightly and told him stories about the farm. Ding Haihua couldn't help but admit in his heart that he really liked this girl who galloped in the fields.
    That night they were cooling off at the alley entrance, sitting together as usual. The street light shone on half of the iron gate. The mottled projection of the iron gate seemed to be inlaid with a row of lace on the ground. Luo Yun stared at the shadow-like lace and talked about her own affairs to Ding Haihua for the first time: Three years ago, after she came out of school, the organization, considering her characteristics, assigned her to a state-owned farm for training to become a tractor driver, hoping that she could become a banner on the farm. To be honest, she was really upset for a few days, and it was hard to hold back the tears from flowing down. ("Luo Yun can also cry!" Ding Haihua thought happily.) But in participating in agricultural labor and production, when she spent the first year under the most difficult conditions, and the following spring she saw that the barren land, which had been barren since ancient times, was full of wheat ears - the wheat ears that grew from the seeds she had sown by hand, the fertile black soil that she had plowed with a tractor! She embraced the land with open arms! When a person's small contribution bears fruit, and one sees large carts of golden grain being loaded into the national granary, is there any greater happiness in the world than this? Isn't this the greatest glory of life?
    "You, you are also a junior high school graduate?" Ding Haihua asked after thinking for a long time.
    "I took my junior high school diploma to the countryside, hey, it's useless, everything has to be learned from scratch! People say that life is school!" Luo Yun suddenly burst out laughing. Ding Haihua felt his face burning hot. Fortunately, Luo Yun was looking up at the starry sky. Under the twinkling summer night sky, Luo Yun's dark and bright eyes seemed to shine with sparks of thought.
    Luo Yun was still looking up and said, "Can't you make up your mind yet? Train yourself to become a laboring intellectual, take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the fields - and then marry a beautiful wife, how wonderful!"
    This time, in the dark, Ding Haihua's face turned red all the way to the roots of his neck. Luo Yun laughed mischievously: "I know, you must be blushing again. Right, little brother?"
    Ding Haihua didn't say anything. He had many dreams at night...
    The next day was the day when the high school entrance exam results were announced. In the evening, no one expected that Haihua's older sister Shuhua would come home from the normal university. These days there was a slight chill in the morning and evening. However, that night everyone still gathered in the narrow open space as usual to chat. Teacher Meng grabbed Shuhua at the entrance of the alley and said, "University student, come and tell us about the anti-rightist struggle!" People listened as Shuhua talked about how rampant the right-wing elements were in attacking the Party, how viciously they slandered the Communist Party and socialism. The men, women, old, and young in the alley, as well as guests from all over, became indignant. Indeed, these days, they had been talking enthusiastically about "stories," "fairy tales," and "miracles," all of which were the reality of the great motherland today and were an integral part of their lives; but in the eyes of bourgeois individual careerists, all of these were just darkness, could this be tolerated? (Ding Haihua shook his head, hating these right-wing elements from the bottom of his heart.)
    "Haihua, you passed the high school entrance exam, didn't you?" Shuhua suddenly remembered and asked.
    This sentence reminded the old grandmother. She suddenly remembered that there was a notification letter from the school in the kitchen cabinet that afternoon. She was just about to stumble to fetch the letter, but Haihua stood up and gently stopped her, saying confidently: "No need, grandma. I have decided to sign up to go to the agricultural cooperative."
    Everyone seemed surprised by this. Only Luo Yun was chuckling on the side. Laughing so mischievously! Strangely, this time Ding Haihua not only didn't blush at all, but unexpectedly launched a counterattack against the "northern girl": making a face.
    As the summer vacation was coming to an end, the guests in this alley gradually returned to their original work positions one by one. A new life was about to begin again. One bright morning, when Ding Haihua walked out of the narrow door of his home amidst the cheerful sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers, the old grandmother reluctantly leaned against the door frame and only said one sentence:
    "You child has really become an adult today!"

    暑假纪事
    何为
    今年暑假对初中毕业生丁海华来说，要算是最值得纪念的一个暑假了。摆在他面前有两条道路：或者是考取了高中继续过学生生活；或者响应庄严的号召“到农村去做第一代有文化的农民”。如果他走的是后一条道路，那么，这个暑假将是他入学以来的最后一个暑假了。
    参加高中入学考试以后，在等待发榜的紧张的日子里，有几天正是今夏天气最热的时候，丁海华往往天蒙蒙亮就挟了一本书出去了。有时去找同学聊天，更多的时候，到附近公园里的池畔碎石径上独自漫步；或是藏在林木深处的角落里沉思默想，借以消磨时间。碰到有一对情侣并肩坐在深绿色的长椅上悄声私语，他摇摇头就走开去了。忧愁如同潮水涨满了心房。一大堆严肃的人生题目在十六岁的少年心底翻腾：怎样才能正确地对待劳动和爱情呢？什么才是真正的幸福？像这样直到晚上很迟很迟才拖着一身疲倦溜回家来，倒下就睡了。
    住在隔壁厢房里的老祖母听见了总是嘀咕：这一夏天，老二海华放了暑假就是考学校忙，老大淑华在大学里干脆忙得连放暑假都忘掉了！一天下午，十一号里的邻居孟老师把报上的消息告诉老太太说，有一帮右派分子到处放火，妄想爬到人民头上，把中国拖回到黑暗的年代里去。
    “不，办不到！”孟老师蓦地在桌子上拍了一掌。“绝对办不到！”重重的又拍了一掌，震得桌上的茶壶杯子直跳。可不是，连一向心平气和的孟老师也冒起火来了。接着他摊开报纸念起新闻来：“你听这一段：‘共青团员丁淑华在大风浪里站稳了立场，捍卫社会主义祖国的伟大事业，和右派分子展开了坚决的斗争！’”孟老师把老光眼镜朝鼻梁上一托，不由赞叹的说：“几个大学生，对着右派分子三千多张大字报，二百多块黑板报，来他一场短兵相接，说理大战，你们家的姑娘可真勇敢哪！”
    “是真的么？报上登着淑华的事情么？怪不得这孩子一个多月不回家了！”老太太虽然没有完全听懂报上的话，却又像一下子明白了不少事理。
    不久，好像连这条弄堂里也发生了变化。有一晚，丁海华破例在家没有出去，他搬了一条小竹凳，随手带了蒲扇到弄口去纳凉。在那块狭长的空地上，出现了几个从来没有见过的陌生人。他想起晚餐桌上祖母说过，最近他们的弄堂里有好几家人家都从远道来了客人：有的是休假回来小住数天的，有的是来接家眷到外乡去准备在那里落户的，有的是出外去参加建设数年不归，特地返家省亲的。听，他们有声有色的在讲些什么呀！
    于是他开始注意：原来九号里那个高个儿是刚从新疆来的地质勘探队员，非常熟悉克拉玛依石油城诞生的故事。他念念不忘横渡大戈壁滩的冒险经历，说到惊险处，仿佛带来了半戈壁沙漠，飞砂走石，听得孩子们都目瞪口呆。十二号里那个土木工程学生刚从长江大桥实习回来，几个老头子听说大桥像长虹般横贯在南方和北方之间，桥身架在滔滔长江的上空，桥顶比上海的二十四层楼国际饭店还高，个个咋舌不止。七号里有一个亲戚在铁路上当列车员，几年来天南地北在许多新筑成的铁路线上旅行，每次他回家来只要随便说些沿途见闻或是举几条铁路的名字，说明它们的起点和终点，就会使得左邻右居听得入迷。
    啊！在星光灿烂的仲夏夜，在一天的辛勤劳动之后，把扇纳凉，听来自四面八方的远道来客讲述自己新鲜的生活经历：是现实中的童话，像梦幻一般的奇迹，到处是使人惊异的社会主义建设的新闻，代替了往昔的年代里古老的神话和传说，大大丰富了夏夜纳凉时聊天的生活，难道还有比这些更能激发人们的想像么？
    初中毕业生丁海华眼睛亮了起来：那些从各个不同的工作岗位上来的人们，为他揭开了生活中最迷人的一页。首先他没有想到，这条上海习见的小小弄堂和整个社会主义建设之间原来还有着那么密切的关系。随后他觉得，生活的天地是这样广阔，而他却为了所谓个人的出路问题躲在公园的角落里左思右想，不由暗暗脸红了。“真傻，真傻呀！”他对自己说。
    容易脸红是丁海华的一个习惯。当他认识了二号里从东北一个国营农场回来的女拖拉机手罗耘的时候，他越是想克服这种红脸的习惯，却越是不容易克服。这个“北方姑娘”——人们都这样亲热地称呼她——是国营农场里的共青团支部书记，是当地有名的生产能手。看起来也不过比丁海华大三、四岁，可是他对丁海华却是一点也不客气。有一次老祖母担心小孙子考不上高中不要急病了，女拖拉机手听见了大笑起来：
    “嗨，丁海华抵得上一头小牛呢，老奶奶！”
    丁海华脸上有些发热。说真的，他有些怕她。而这个有些野性的“北方姑娘”偏偏看见他脸红就越是揶揄他。譬如她听说丁海华对下乡去参加农业生产，内心斗争很厉害，于是就拿话一句一句顶他，一点不饶人。那一回丁海华真要生气了。可是罗耘一下子又紧紧握着丁海华的手，给他讲农场里的故事。丁海华不能不在心里承认，他实在喜欢这个驰骋在田野里的姑娘。
    那天晚上他们在弄口乘凉，照例又坐在一起。路灯照着半扇铁门。铁门斑驳的投影好像在地上镶着一列花边。罗耘凝视着剪影似的花边，第一次向丁海华谈起自己的事情；三年前，她从学校里出来，组织上考虑到她的特点分配她去国营农场受训练，当一名拖拉机手，希望她能够成为农场里的一面旗帜。说实话，她心里的确闹了几天别扭，好容易忍住不让眼泪流下来。（“罗耘也会流泪！”丁海华快意地想。）但是在参加农业劳动生产中，当她在最困难的条件下度过了第一个年头，第二年春天看见在那亘古以来就是不毛之地的荒土上，一望无际长满了麦穗——那麦穗是她亲手播种下去的种籽长出来的呀，那肥沃的黑土是她开过拖拉机翻犁过的呀！她一个合扑张臂抱住了土地！欢乐的泪水淌在处女地上。当一个人微小的贡献有了收获，亲眼看见一大车一大车黄金般的粮食装进国家的仓库里去的时候，世上还有比这更大的幸福吗？这不是人生最大的光荣吗？
    “你，你也是初中毕业生？”丁海华想了半天，忍不住问道。
    “我拿了初中毕业文凭到农村去，嗨，不顶事，什么都还得从头学起！人家说，生活就是学校呀！”罗耘突然喷出一阵大笑。丁海华觉得自己的脸有些热辣辣的发烫。幸亏罗耘正在仰起头远瞩满天星斗。在闪闪烁烁的夏夜星空之下，罗耘乌黑明亮的眼珠仿佛闪耀着思想的火花。
    罗耘还是仰着头说：“你难道还下不了决心吗？把自己锻炼成一个劳动知识分子，在田野上生根、开花、结果——赶明儿再娶个漂亮的媳妇，多美呀！”
    这回，丁海华在黑暗中，一张脸，直红到脖子根。罗耘顽皮地大笑着：“我知道，你准是又脸红了。对吗，小弟弟？”
    丁海华没有作声。夜里他做了许多梦……
    第二天是高中升学考试发榜的日子。晚上，谁也没有想到，海华的姊姊淑华从师范大学回家来了。这几天早晚微有寒意。然而那一夜大家还是照常聚集在狭长的空地上闲聊。孟老师在弄堂口一把拉住淑华说：“大学生，快来给我们大家讲讲反右派斗争！”人们听淑华说右派分子如何猖狂地向党进攻，如何恶毒地诬蔑共产党，诬蔑社会主义，弄堂里男女老少以及来自各地的客人们愤激起来了。真的，这些日子以来，他们每夜津津乐道的讲着“故事”“童话”“奇迹”无一不是今天伟大祖国的现实，并且都是他们生活中不可分割的一部分；而在资产阶级个人野心家眼里所有这些只是一团漆黑，这难道是能够容忍的吗？（丁海华摇摇头，从心底憎恨这帮右派分子。）
    “海华，你考取了高中是么？”淑华忽然想起来问道。
    这句话提醒了老祖母。她猛然想起下午学校里有一封通知书放在厨房的柜子里，正要跌跌跣跣去取信，海华站起来轻轻阻止了她，胸有成竹地说：“不用了，奶奶。我决定报名到农业社去了。”
    大家都好像为此吃了一惊。只有罗耘在一边吃吃地笑着。笑得这样顽皮！奇怪的是这一次丁海华不但一点也没有脸红，反而出其不意地对着“北方姑娘”回戈一击：做了一个鬼脸。
    暑假快过去时，这条里弄里的客人们一个一个陆续回到各自原来的工作岗位上去了。新的生活又将开始了。一个辉朗的早晨，丁海华在锣鼓和鞭炮的欢送声中走出家庭的窄门时，老祖母依依不舍的倚着门框只说了一句：
    “你这孩子今天真变成大人了！”
