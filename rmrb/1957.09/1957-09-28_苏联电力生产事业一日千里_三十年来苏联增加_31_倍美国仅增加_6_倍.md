    Moscow, September 27th (From Our Newspaper) – Soviet Union's electricity production in 1957 will reach 210 billion kilowatt-hours, 105 times that of 1913 and 420 times that of 1920. The daily power generation now exceeds the total power generation for the entire year of 1920. This was stated by the Minister of Power Stations of the Soviet Union, Mr. Pavlenko, at a press conference on the 26th. He spoke enthusiastically about the achievements of Soviet electricity production over the past forty years. He said that the GOELRO plan (State Commission for Electrification of Russia) was overfulfilled. The Soviet people are actively striving to continue Lenin's cause of electrification. Therefore, electricity production is growing particularly fast. Before the start of the First Five-Year Plan, countries such as Britain, France, and Italy all had higher electricity production than the Soviet Union. However, last year, the Soviet Union's electricity production was equal to the total electricity production of Britain, France, and Italy, firmly holding the first place in Europe. Soviet electricity production grows by 11% to 12% annually, and the speed of development far exceeds that of the United States. Comparing 1956 with 1929, Soviet electricity increased 31 times, while the United States only increased 6 times.
    In recent years, the Soviet Union has built many large hydropower stations. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will be fully operational before the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Many large thermal power plants have also been built, mainly using cheap fuels such as lignite, peat, and natural gas. Speaking about the prospects of Soviet electricity development, Pavlenko said that by 1960, the Soviet Union's electricity production will reach more than 300 billion kilowatt-hours. Therefore, the increase in electricity during the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be equal to the electricity of the previous thirty years. A unified European power system will be built, with a generating capacity of 30 million kilowatts. While paying attention to the utilization of water resources, special attention will be paid to the utilization of the Angara and Yenisei rivers. Thermal power plants will remain the main basis for electricity production for a long time to come. In addition, atomic energy power stations with a generating capacity of over 400,000 kilowatts are being built in the Urals and the central region. The Soviet Union has also helped people's democratic countries build 40 power stations, with 47 under construction and 27 in the planning stage.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 27th: TASS Moscow reported: A bulletin issued by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union stated that the milk production in the Soviet Union in the first eight months of this year increased by 21% compared with the same period last year. The national annual plan for the requisition and purchase of milk has been completed by 96%.
    As of September 20 this year, the state requisitioned and purchased 16.7 million tons of milk, 2.6 million tons more than in the same period last year. In the first eight months of this year, oil and fat production increased by 16% compared with the same period last year. The bulletin stated that these materials show that the Soviet Union's task of catching up with the United States in the production of livestock products in the next few years is being victoriously carried out.

    苏联电力生产事业一日千里
    三十年来苏联增加31倍美国仅增加6倍
    本报莫斯科27日电　苏联1957年的电力生产将达到二千一百亿度，为1913年的一百零五倍，为1920年的四百二十倍。现在每天的发电量比1920年全年的发电量还多。这是苏联电站部部长巴甫连科26日在记者招待会上说的。他畅谈了四十年来苏联电力生产的成就。他说：全俄电气化计划是超额完成了。苏联人民积极地努力继续着列宁的电气化事业。因此电力生产增长特别快。在第一个五年计划开始之前，英、法、意等国的电力生产都比苏联多。而去年苏联所生产的电力已等于英、法、意三国电产量的总和，稳居欧洲的第一位。苏联电力生产每年增长11％到12％，发展的速度大大超过美国。以1956年与1929年比较，苏联电力增加了三十一倍，而美国才增加了六倍。
    近年来苏联建设了许多大水电站。古比雪夫水电站将在十月革命四十周年前全部发电，还建设了许多大火电厂，主要是利用褐煤、泥炭、天燃气等等便宜燃料。巴甫连科谈到苏联电力发展的前途时说：到1960年苏联的电力生产将达三千多亿度。因此在第六个五年计划时期增加的电力将等于前此三十多年的电力。将建成统一的欧洲动力系统，它拥有三千万瓩的发电能力。在注意利用水力资源时，将特别注意安加拉河和叶尼塞河的利用。火电厂在今后长期内仍为电力生产的主要基础。此外，在乌拉尔和中部正在建设着发电能力为四十万瓩以上的原子能发电站。苏联还帮助人民民主国家建成了四十座电力站，正在建设的有四十七座，还有二十七座在计划中。
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议中央统计局发表的公告中说，苏联今年头八个月的牛奶产量比去年同一时期增加了21％。全国征购和采购牛奶的年度计划已经完成了96％。
    截至今年9月20日为止，国家征购和采购了一千六百七十万吨牛奶，比去年同期多二百六十万吨。今年头八个月的油脂生产比去年同期增加了16％。公告说，这些材料表明，苏联关于在最近几年内在畜牧业产品生产方面赶上美国的任务正在胜利地执行中。
