After reading the notice from the county, I was stunned for a long time, my heart pounding. It seemed that I would be leaving this agricultural cooperative for a relatively long period.

The sun was already setting, and I rushed back "home" in a hurry. The kitchen was filled with smoke, and I shouted into the smoke: "Granny Li, I'm leaving tomorrow!" Granny Li, busy getting out of the smoke, opened her tearful eyes (from the smoke) and quickly asked, "What's the matter, so urgent?" I said, "The county notified me that I might be called to the provincial Party school to study." "How long will that take?" "Maybe three or five months, who knows." Granny Li muttered, "You superiors are really something! A comrade comes, just gets familiar, and then is transferred away. None of the comrades who come to work in our cooperative stay for even half a year."

Actually, I had been here for almost eight months, but at that moment, I wasn't in the mood to argue with her. I went into the bedroom, grabbed a stack of materials, and turned around to go to the cooperative director to hand over my work. Granny Li told me to come back early for dinner, and swaying her small feet, she went to the vegetable garden.

Looking at her back, I couldn't help but feel a sense of impending separation from my "family."

Eight months ago, when I first arrived at this cooperative, a "collapse" wind was blowing through the cooperative. More than thirty of the one hundred and twenty-odd households were clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative, especially the situation in the Fourth Production Team was even worse. I decided to go to this team first to take a look. Upon arriving at the team, I spent two days wandering around the tiled-roof courtyard area. There were many upper-middle peasants here, and many were clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative. On the one hand, I wanted to get a sense of their underlying thoughts, and on the other hand, I was greedy for the clean and tidy houses, good food, and not having to sleep in "shared bunks," which made things easier. But after going around, the situation didn't improve. I began to think: Didn't the county repeatedly instruct us to first mobilize the poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants? So I shifted my activities to the thatched-roof courtyard area.

On the first day, I met Granny Li. She dragged a stool for me to sit on, only asked me my surname, and offered neither tea nor cigarettes, being extremely cold. I thought she was a "Five Guarantees" household, so I asked, "Old woman, is the cooperative's 'Five Guarantees' allowance enough for you?" Who knew that this question would make her pull a long face, and she didn't respond for a long time. Feeling bored, I could only awkwardly walk away.

The next morning, I climbed up the hillside and saw a wisp of smoke rising from the mountain gully. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be seven or eight women digging up turf and burning ashes. Granny Li was also among them, briskly wielding her hoe, speaking loudly, and appearing very lively, completely unlike her cold demeanor when we first met. I was very surprised. The attendance rate in this team had been very low recently, so why were these women so active? I jumped into the gully, and Granny Li glanced at me suspiciously. I asked, "Are you accumulating fertilizer for the cooperative?" One of the women replied, "Yes!" While saying "I'll join in," I rolled up my trouser legs, picked up a hoe, and started working.

During the break, Granny Li pulled me, saying, "Come to my house for dinner." After eating at her house, I learned that Granny Li was not only not a "Five Guarantees" household, but also worked very well and was awarded the title of Model of Loving the Cooperative last year. It was said that the cooperative had long ago classified her as a "Five Guarantees" household, but upon hearing the news, she immediately ran to the cooperative director's house and threw a fierce tantrum until the director agreed to cancel her "Five Guarantees" status. At that time, others asked her, "You're so old, why do you still have to work? What for?" She said, "I'm only fifty-three years old, what's old about that? If I don't want to work, then I'm sure to get sick."

From then on, I often visited her house, and soon simply moved in. I also discovered that she not only loved to work, but was also very shrewd. When it came to talking about the situation in the team, she was practically a living dictionary. For example, she said, "The production team leader's family is wealthy now, and he hangs out with the rich households all day long. He even partners with a rich peasant to do business. He speaks beautifully on the surface, but in reality, his work is passive." She also said, "Don't think that Wang Qi'er doesn't say anything at meetings, he really cares about the cooperative in his heart." In short, she knew exactly what so-and-so had done in the past, like reciting a family tree. My in-depth understanding of the masses proved that she was nine-tenths right.

One night, her only thirteen-year-old son, Zhongyi, told me, "That time, my mother was a little resentful of you!" I was surprised: "Why?" Zhongyi said, "She resented you for saying she was a 'Five Guarantees' household, and she also resented you for only running to the wealthy households' homes and not coming to our poor peasant's house." Only then did I suddenly realize, remembering that every time I visited, she would always say, "Come often, isn't my house clean too?" What a profound criticism that sentence was!

I gradually came to regard this place as my own home. She did my washing and mending, treating me like her own son. Zhongyi went to school during the day, and always followed me to various production teams to attend meetings at night. The two were extremely close. This child, Zhongyi, was sold to someone as an adopted son when he was two years old. It was only a year ago, when Granny Li joined the agricultural cooperative and her life improved a little, that she redeemed him.

The next day, at the crack of dawn, I ate a hearty breakfast and began to pack my luggage. But when I opened the cabinet, I saw that the packages had already been packed neatly. The two pieces of torn clothing and two pairs of socks had also been mended. No wonder Granny Li's room was still lit up late last night! My heart was filled with emotion, and just as I was about to speak, the cooperative director and many other cooperative members arrived at Granny Li's house. Wang Qi'er rushed to carry my luggage for me, but I insisted on refusing. He picked up the luggage and left regardless. Everyone saw me off outside the door, and I waved my hand, "Folks, please go inside, goodbye!" Taking a few steps, I turned around and saw Granny Li leaning against the doorframe, Zhongyi standing beside her. She looked at me with loving kindness, tears glistening in her eyes. For a moment, my chest was filled with a surge of reluctant parting, my eyes were hot. I thought, isn't she just like my deceased mother? The motherly love that I had lost for many years, I had found it again here.

    历娭毑
    芳草
    读完县里来的通知，我楞了好大一会儿，胸口突突地跳着。看来，我要比较长期的离开这个农业社了。
    太阳已经打斜，我三脚两步跑回“家”。灶屋里面烟雾迷漫，我冲着烟里喊：“历娭毑，俺明儿要走啦。”历娭毑忙着从烟里钻出来，睁起流着泪的眼（被烟熏的）忙问：“什么事，这么急？”我说：“县里通知，可能叫到省党校学习哩。”“那要多久呢？”“说不定，得要三、五个月吧。”历娭毑嘀咕开了：“你们上级真是！来一个同志，刚混熟，又调走。到俺社里工作的同志没有蹲上半年的。”
    其实我已经来了将近八个月，但这时无心跟她去分辩，就走进卧房，拿了一叠材料，转身出来准备找社长交代工作去。历娭毑叮嘱我早些回来吃夜饭，摆动小脚往菜园里去了。
    望着她的背影，我心头不禁涌起即将同“家人”别离一样的滋味。
    八个月以前，当我刚到这个社的时候，社里正刮着一股“垮”风，一百二十多户社员竟有三十多户闹着要退社，特别是第四生产队的情况更糟。我决定首先到这个队去看看。一到队上，我在瓦屋场转了两天。这里上中农多，闹退社的也多。我一方面想摸一摸思想底子，一方面也贪图这些屋里干净利落、饭菜好、睡觉不要“打吊铺”，方便一些。可是转来转去，情况却并不好转。我开始想到：县里不是再三交代过，要先去发动贫农和新老下中农这三部分人吗？于是我把活动阵地转到了茅屋场那边。
    头一天，我就碰到历娭毑。她拖了条板凳让我坐，只问我一句贵姓，既没有茶，也没有烟，冷淡得不行。我以为她是个五保户，就问道：“老人家，社里的五保金够不够用？”谁知这一问，她竟把个脸拉下来，半天没有答理我。我觉得没趣，只好讪讪地走开了。
    第二天清早，我爬上山坡，看见山沟里冒出一缕轻烟。近前一看，原来是七、八个妇女正在刨草皮，烧火灰呢。历娭毑也在内，她轻快地挥着锄头，大声地说话，显得很活泼，全不像见面时那付冷淡样子。我很奇怪，这个队近来的出工率很低，为啥这些妇女倒这样积极呢？我跳进沟里，历娭毑怀疑地望了我一眼。我问：“是替社里积肥吗？”一个妇女回答：“对！”我边说“我参加一个”，边就卷起裤筒，拿起一把锄头干起来。
    歇工时，历娭毑拉了我一把，说：“到俺家吃饭去吧。”我在她家里吃了饭之后，才知道历娭毑不仅不是五保户，而且劳动得很不赖，去年评上了爱社模范。据说社里老早就将她划作五保户了，她听到消息，马上跑到社长家，狠狠地发了顿脾气，直到社长答应取消五保待遇她才算了。当时旁人问她：“你这么大年纪，还非要干活，为个啥？”她说：“俺才五十三岁，老个啥？俺要是不想干活，那准是要生病了。”
    从此，我时常到她家串门，不久索性搬进来住下了。我又发现她不仅爱劳动，而且挺精明，要谈起队里的情况，简直就是一本活字典。比方她说：“生产队长如今家底子厚了，成天跟富裕户伙在一块，还和富农合伙做生意。表面上说得漂亮，实际上工作消极。”又说：“别看王七二开会不吱声，他心里可着实为社好。”总之，某人某人从前都做些什么，她都原原本本如数家谱。我深入群众了解证明，她的话十成有九成没错。
    有一天晚上，她那个唯一的十三岁的儿子中意告诉我：“那次俺娘是有点恨你！”我惊异了：“为啥呢？”中意说：“她恨你不该说她是五保户，还恨你光往富裕户家里跑，不到俺贫农家来。”我这才猛省，记起几次串门时，她总要说一句：“常来吧，俺家不也干干净净的吗？”这句话是多么深刻的批评！
    我逐渐把这里当做了自己的家。她替我浆洗缝补，待我像自己亲生的儿子似的。中意白天上学，晚上总跟着我到各个生产队去开会，两人亲热得不得了。中意这孩子在二岁时就卖给人家做养子了，只在一年前，历娭毑加入了农业社，生活过好了一点，才把他赎回来的。
    次日，天蒙蒙亮，我吃了一顿丰美的早饭，便着手去收拾行李。可是打开柜门一看，包裹早就打得好好的了。破烂了的两件衣服，两双袜子，也已经补好。怪不得昨夜历娭毑房里半夜还亮着灯呢！我心里充满了激情，正想说话，社长和其他许多社员，都来到历娭毑家了。王七二抢着要给我挑行李，我坚持不肯，他不由分说，挑起行李就走了。大家把我送到门外，我挥挥手，“乡亲们，请进去吧，再见！”拔腿走了几步，回过头来，只见历娭毑倚在门框上，中意站在她身旁，她慈爱地望着我，眼睛里闪耀着泪花。一时，我的胸腔里冲激着一股依依难舍的离情，我的眼睛热乎乎的。我想，她不跟我死去的娘一样吗？失去多年的母爱，又在这里找到了。
