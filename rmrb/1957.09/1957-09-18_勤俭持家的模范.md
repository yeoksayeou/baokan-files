Role Models of Thrift and Frugality in Managing a Household
By Our Reporter Xiao Ming

Managing household affairs is a common kind of labor, but also an indispensable one. Women who undertake this labor often have to serve the elderly while raising and educating children; they must boil water to cook, wash clothes, and iron shirts, while also participating in various social activities.

Zhuang Chaoyun, a representative from Sichuan Province to this Women’s Congress, and Wu Peilan, a representative from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are exemplary figures in this regard.

Zhuang Chaoyun has five children. The oldest is already fourteen, but he is disabled and cannot participate in household labor. The youngest is only two years old. This is a family with many mouths to feed and few people to work. To make this family happy and prosperous, the first step is to find ways to increase family income. This is exactly what Zhuang Chaoyun does. Although she is the mother of five children, she is among the best and most frequent participants in cooperative labor among the local women. This year alone, Zhuang Chaoyun has already worked more than 220 workdays. Zhuang Chaoyun's family also raises two large, fat pigs, a sow, and many poultry. In addition, Zhuang Chaoyun serves as the deputy director and production team leader of the agricultural cooperative. Since the establishment of the cooperative in 1953, the production team led by Zhuang Chaoyun has consistently been the best in the entire county. She manages so much work and chores so well, which naturally caught the reporter's attention. When the reporter raised this question, Zhuang Chaoyun said that she carefully arranges her work and chores and is good at doing several things at the same time. Zhuang Chaoyun often prepares pig feed while cooking, and does needlework while attending meetings. Of course, her husband and children also help with many things. Wu Peilan, a family member of an employee of the Baotou Agricultural Machinery Factory in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is also skilled at managing household affairs. Although Wu Peilan has six children, she manages the household very well. Because she also serves as the director of the family committee, she also helps others manage their household affairs well.

To live a good life, it is not enough to be diligent; one must also be good at practicing thrift. Although Zhuang Chaoyun and Wu Peilan have different living environments and different income situations, their common characteristic is that they are skilled at budgeting carefully and living frugally. Every year after the autumnal equinox, Zhuang Chaoyun's family roughly calculates how much rice the whole family will eat per day during the busy farming season and how much rice they will eat per day during the slack season; how much potatoes, sweet potatoes, and vegetables should be mixed into the rice. Zhuang Chaoyun said, "We calculate this way not because we can't make ends meet, but because we want to live a better life. Mixing potatoes, sweet potatoes, and vegetables into the rice is both delicious and saves grain." Zhuang Chaoyun also saves every penny possible on miscellaneous expenses. For example, haircuts may not cost much, but they add up. Four boys need haircuts at least four or five yuan a year, so Zhuang Chaoyun bought a razor and cuts the children's hair herself. Zhuang Chaoyun said there should always be some savings in case of unexpected needs. Now Zhuang Chaoyun's family has saved more than two hundred yuan. Wu Peilan's husband is an engineer with a relatively ample income, but Wu Peilan still pays attention to thrift. The whole family spends only seventy yuan a month on food and expenses. The remaining money is either sent to her parents-in-law or saved. This year, Wu Peilan's family bought one hundred and eighty yuan of government bonds.

Although Wu Peilan is so thrifty, she always tries to help solve the problems of her neighbors or friends when they have difficulties. Therefore, many people ask Wu Peilan's family for help. Her family's savings are like a revolving mutual aid fund, solving the urgent needs of this family and the difficulties of that family.

Last winter, the emerging clothing industry in Baotou City seemed particularly inadequate, and workers were worried about sewing cotton-padded clothes. At this time, Wu Peilan organized family members who were skilled in sewing to form a sewing group to make cotton-padded clothes for the workers, and the price was lower than the market price. At the same time, the difficulties of many workers' families were thus more thoroughly resolved. Chen Yueying's family had many children and little income, making life very difficult. The couple often quarreled and even wanted to divorce. Since Chen Yueying joined the sewing group, she could earn more than twenty yuan a month, and the family's life was no longer difficult, and the couple became harmonious. The factory often had some temporary work, and Wu Peilan introduced some family members with difficulties to do some temporary work. For family members who could not leave home, she would send the work that could be done at home to these family members. Wu Peilan has thus solved many difficulties for other workers' families.

Wu Peilan not only carefully budgets for her own family, but also cares about the factory's production increase and economy. The family sewing group processes gloves for the factory. The clothing store needs 1.23 feet of cloth per pair of gloves, but the sewing group only needs 1.08 feet. For processing aprons, the clothing store needs 3.2 feet of cloth, but the sewing group needs three feet. In October last year, when the factory lacked raw materials, Wu Peilan also organized and mobilized the families of employees to pick out more than 16,000 catties of scrap iron from garbage coal ash and hand them over to the factory. The factory wanted to give money, but the families of employees reflected, "We don't want money. We are increasing production and practicing economy for the country." And Zhuang Chaoyun, precisely because she put her great enthusiasm and sense of responsibility into the leadership work of the production team, was able to make her production team the best in Xindu County for four years.

Zhuang Chaoyun, Wu Peilan, and many other role models of thrift and frugality in managing a household have attracted people's attention at this Women's Congress. People deeply realize that in the most common labor of managing household affairs, not only is a diligent and simple ideological style needed, but it also contains much knowledge and wisdom.

　　勤俭持家的模范
　　本报记者　萧明
    操持家务，是一种平凡的劳动，也是一种不可缺少的劳动。担负着这一劳动的妇女，常常是既要侍奉老人，又要抚养教育子女；既要烧水作饭洗衣浆衫，又要参加社会上的各种活动。
    参加这届妇代会的四川省代表庄朝云和内蒙古自治区代表吴佩兰就是这方面的模范人物。
    庄朝云有五个孩子，大孩子虽已十四岁，但是个残废者，不能参加家庭劳动，最小的还只有两岁，这是一个吃饭的人多干活的人少的家庭。要使这个家庭幸福愉快，首先要设法增加家庭收入。庄朝云正是这样做的，她虽是一个五个孩子的母亲，但是在当地妇女中，是参加合作社劳动最好最多的一个。以今年来说，庄朝云已作了二百二十多个劳动日。庄朝云家还喂有两只大肥猪、一只母猪和许多家禽。此外，庄朝云还担任了农业社的副主任兼生产队长。自1953年建社以来，庄朝云领导的生产队一直是全县最好的生产队。这么多的工作与活计，还作得这样好，这不由得引起了记者的注意。记者提出这个问题时，庄朝云说，要把工作活计好好安排，而且要善于在同一时间里作几样事情。庄朝云经常一边作饭，一边准备猪的饲料；一边开会，一边作针线活。当然，丈夫和孩子也帮助作了许多事情。内蒙古自治区包头市农业机械厂的职工家属吴佩兰，也是一个善于管理家务的人。吴佩兰虽有六个孩子，但把家务管理得很好，又因为她担负着家属委员会主任职务，还要帮助别人把家务管理好。
    要过好日子，不光要勤劳，而且要善于节俭。庄朝云和吴佩兰的生活环境虽然不同，收入情况也不同，但她们的共同的特点，是会精打细算节俭度日。庄朝云家在每年秋分以后，就要大概的计算一下，全家农忙时一天吃多少米，农闲时一天吃多少米；饭里边应当掺多少洋芋，红苕，蔬菜等。庄朝云说：“这样计算不是因为日子过不去，而是想把日子过的更好。饭里边掺洋芋、红苕、蔬菜，又好吃又省粮。”在零星开支上，庄朝云也是能省一个钱就省一个钱。比如剃头，这本来花不了多少钱，可是总起来就不少，四个男孩子一年至少也得四、五元剃头钱，庄朝云就买把刀，自己给孩子剃头。庄朝云说总要有点节余，以备意外之用。现在庄朝云家已储蓄了二百多元。吴佩兰的丈夫是工程师，收入比较宽裕，但是吴佩兰还是注意节俭，全家一个月连吃带用只花七十多元，余下的钱除寄些给公婆外，就储蓄起来，今年吴佩兰家就买了一百八十元公债。
    吴佩兰虽然如此节俭，但是邻居或朋友有了困难，她总尽量设法帮助解决。因此，请求吴佩兰家帮助的人是不少的，她家的储蓄好像是流动互助金，解决了这家的急需，又解决了那家的困难。
    去年冬季新兴的包头市的服装业显得特别不足，职工们正在为缝制棉衣而发愁。这时，吴佩兰组织起擅长缝纫的家属成立缝纫组，为工人赶制棉衣，而且工价低于市价；同时，许多职工家庭的困难因此得到了比较彻底的解决。陈月英家孩子多，收入少，生活十分困难，夫妻两人因此常常吵架，甚至要闹离婚；自从陈月英参加缝纫组以后，每月可以收入二十多元，家庭生活就不再困难，夫妻也和睦起来。厂子里常有些临时性工作，吴佩兰就介绍一些有困难的家属去作些临时工，对离不开家的家属，她就把能拿到家里作的活送到这些家属家里。吴佩兰就是这样为别的职工家属解决了不少困难。
    吴佩兰不光给自己的家精打细算，还很关心自己厂子的增产节约。家属缝纫组给厂子加工手套，服装店里每付手套要1.23尺布，缝纫组只要1.08尺布，加工围裙，服装店要3.2尺布，缝纫组要三尺。去年10月间，厂子缺乏原料时，吴佩兰还组织和发动职工家属从垃圾煤灰里拣出来一万六千多斤碎铁，交给厂子，厂子要给钱，职工家属们反映说：“我们不要钱，我们是为国家增产节约。”而庄朝云，也正是由于她以巨大的热情和责任心投入生产队的领导工作中，才有可能使她的生产队四年来一直是新都县最好的生产队。
    庄朝云与吴佩兰等许多位勤俭持家的模范，在这届妇代大会上受到了人们的注意。人们深深的体会到，在操持家务这个最平凡的劳动里，不仅需要勤劳朴素的思想作风，而且包含着许多学问和智慧。
