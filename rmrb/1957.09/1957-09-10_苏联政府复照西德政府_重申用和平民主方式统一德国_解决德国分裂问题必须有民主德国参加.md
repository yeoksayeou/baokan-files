Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 9th: The Soviet government, in a note to the West German government on September 7th, stated that the West German government must now choose: either abandon the policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, abandon preparations for atomic war, and gradually restore German unity peacefully, or continue to pursue the extremely dangerous current policy direction and be responsible for maintaining and deepening the division of Germany. There is no third way.

This note is the Soviet government's response to the West German government's memorandum of May 24th. Prior to this, the Soviet Union had sent a note to the West German government last October on the issue of restoring German unity, and the West German government's memorandum was a response to the Soviet government's note from last year.

The Soviet government's note of September 7th pointed out that the West German government's memorandum attempted to defend the policies of the United States, Britain, France, and itself, and distorted the Soviet Union's position on the German question. The note stated that the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed guaranteeing the maintenance of Germany's national unity and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. However, its proposals have been repeatedly and resolutely opposed by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. Moreover, the Germans currently in leading positions in West Germany have also adopted such a position, opposing the restoration of German unity into a peace-loving and democratic country.

The note stated that, obviously, if the West German government continues to encourage militarism and continues to turn West Germany into an atomic base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, it cannot claim to be a supporter of German unification. In this case, what is the meaning of its proposed slogan of all-German elections? It is very clear that voting cannot eliminate the profound differences that have formed between the two Germanys in the post-war period, nor can it overcome the gap that exists between the peace-loving policies of the German Democratic Republic and the aggressive militaristic policies of the ruling circles of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The note stated that the West German government is attempting to portray the situation as if German unification can be achieved through foreign countries. In fact, only the Germans themselves can negotiate feasible steps for restoring German unification. There is no and cannot be any other way to solve this problem other than a path agreed upon by the two Germanys. Any practical measures to resolve the division of the two Germanys are unimaginable without the participation of the German Democratic Republic.

The note cited the proposal put forward by the government of the German Democratic Republic on July 27th regarding the establishment of a German Confederation, the prohibition of the storage and production of atomic weapons on German territory, and the separate withdrawal of the two Germanys from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact Organization.

The note stated that this proposal can get rid of the dead end into which the ruling circles of West Germany have led the cause of German unification, and make it realistically possible for Germany to unite into a peace-loving and democratic country. It is regrettable that this proposal has not received the attention of the West German government.

The note stated that the Soviet government still supports the reunification of Germany in a peaceful and democratic manner, and it agrees with and supports the proposals of the government of Democratic Germany. It believes that the establishment of the German Confederation will also help create the preconditions for preparing and concluding a German peace treaty, without which the situation in Germany will be adversely affected.

The Soviet government finally expressed its hope that the West German government will study the propositions put forward in the note with due attention.

### 苏联政府复照西德政府  重申用和平民主方式统一德国  解决德国分裂问题必须有民主德国参加

    苏联政府复照西德政府
    重申用和平民主方式统一德国
    解决德国分裂问题必须有民主德国参加
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在9月7日照会西德政府说，西德政府现在必须加以选择：或者放弃北大西洋公约组织的政策，放弃准备原子战争并逐步和平恢复德国统一，或者继续奉行极端危险的现行政策方针，并为保持和加深德国的分裂负责。第三条道路是没有的。
    这个照会是苏联政府对西德政府5月24日备忘录的答复。在这以前，苏联曾经在去年10月就恢复德国统一问题照会西德政府，西德政府的这个备忘录就是答复苏联政府去年的照会的。
    苏联政府9月7日的照会指出，西德政府的备忘录企图为美、英、法三国和它自己的政策辩护，并且歪曲了苏联在德国问题上的立场。照会说，苏联政府不止一次地建议保证维持德国的国家统一，同德国缔结和约。但是，它的建议屡次为美、英、法三国政府所坚决反对。而且，目前在西德居领导地位的德国人也采取了这样的立场，反对德国恢复统一成为一个爱好和平和民主的国家。
    照会说，显然，如果西德政府继续鼓励军国主义，继续把西德变成北大西洋公约组织国家的原子基地，它就不能以统一德国的拥护者自居。在这种情况下，它所提出的全德选举的口号又有什么意义呢？非常明显，用投票的办法不能消灭两个德国之间在战后时期形成的深刻的区别，不能克服存在于德意志民主共和国爱好和平的政策和德意志联邦共和国统治集团侵略性的军国主义方针之间的鸿沟。
    照会说，西德政府企图把事情说成似乎德国的统一可以通过外国来实现。事实上只有德国人自己才能够协商有关恢复德国统一的可行步骤。除了两个德国之间一致同意的途径以外，没有而且也不可能有别的解决这个问题的途径。任何解决两个德国分裂的实际措施，如果没有德意志民主共和国参加都是不可想像的。
    照会引述了德意志民主共和国政府7月27日提出的关于建立德意志联邦、关于禁止在德国境内存放和生产原子武器、关于两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织的建议。
    照会说，这个建议能够摆脱西德统治集团把德国统一事业引入的死路，使德国有现实可能团结成为一个爱好和平的和民主的国家。很感遗憾的是，这个建议没有得到西德政府的重视。
    照会说，苏联政府仍然支持用和平和民主的方式统一德国，它赞同和支持民主德国政府的建议。它认为，德意志邦联的成立同时有助于为准备和缔结德国和约创造先决条件，没有这个和约就会对德国的局势起着不良影响。
    苏联政府最后表示希望，西德政府能以应有的重视来研究照会中所提出的主张。
