    Commentary on the Fujiyama-Dulles Talks
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    Taking advantage of his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama went to Washington for talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. The content of the talks reportedly involved many issues in the diplomatic and economic relations between Japan and the United States.

    In the economic sphere, Japan seemed to have considerable expectations for this meeting. The Japanese economy is currently facing difficulties due to a huge deficit in its international balance of payments, which stems primarily from trade with the United States. The U.S. boycott of Japanese goods, which started with Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States in June, has not eased but has instead intensified. On September 20, three Japanese economic organizations, including the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, held a meeting to prepare for the establishment of a joint committee to deal with the U.S. boycott of Japanese goods and increase Japan's exports to the United States. However, the meeting decided to wait and see the results of Fujiyama's negotiations with the United States before establishing the joint committee. Clearly, in the view of some members of the Japanese ruling class, since the current Japanese government has raised the banner of pro-Americanism and anti-communism in the political and military spheres, and is further dependent on the United States, it might be able to gain some room for bargaining with the United States in the economic sphere, and even obtain some concessions from the U.S. side. However, the joint statement issued by Fujiyama and Dulles on the 23rd poured cold water on those who held such ideas.

    The joint statement simply mentioned that "Mr. Fujiyama called attention to the mutual importance of US-Japan trade and made particular mention of the great imbalance of trade in Japan’s trade with the United States”; and Dulles even understatedly "expressed his understanding of Japan’s concern about its foreign trade." Obviously, if Japan simply wanted to explain the importance of U.S.-Japan trade and the huge trade deficit in Japan's trade with the United States, and the United States simply wanted to express its "understanding" of Japan's concerns in foreign trade, why did Fujiyama need to travel thousands of miles to meet with Dulles? Such empty words in the joint statement can only indicate that Fujiyama's intention, expressed before his departure, to "resolutely request" that "the United States must stop restricting the import of Japanese goods" has fallen through.

    Regarding the issue of Japan wanting the United States to provide funds to establish an international fund for the development of Southeast Asia, Nobusuke Kishi raised this issue during his visit to the United States in June of this year. The United States then perfunctorily said that it needed to be "studied," and it was very clear that the United States was not interested in this plan. However, when Fujiyama held talks with Dulles this time, he still raised this issue and hoped that Japan and the United States could "reach a principled understanding on the issue of U.S. government funding." The joint statement did not mention this issue at all, indicating that the result was still not good.

    Japan calls its foreign trade its "lifeline." Since it regards the trade issue as so serious, Japan should have its own independent and autonomous policy. The huge trade deficit in Japan's trade with the United States cannot be solved by simply "resolutely requesting" the United States to show great mercy. Originally, Japan was completely capable of finding another way out. As a member of friendly coexistence with Asian and African countries, truly carrying out economic cooperation with Asian and African countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is one of the reliable ways to improve Japan's international balance of payments and develop the Japanese economy. However, the Japanese government does not intend to do so, and is willing to obey the United States. In order to win the favor of the United States, it does not hesitate to do things that are detrimental to the strengthening of economic cooperation among Asian countries. Recently, the Japanese government has been publicizing the reception of Zhang Qun, a so-called "special envoy" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is obviously also one of the anti-communist and anti-neutralist gestures made to please the United States.

    Since the Japanese government's policy of obeying the United States cannot be exchanged for economic benefits, it is even less likely to achieve any results in political negotiations. It is said that Fujiyama raised the issue of the status of the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands in his talks with Dulles. The joint statement stated: "The Japanese government is satisfied with the establishment of the US-Japan Security Consultative Committee and the efficiency shown by the committee in promoting cooperation and understanding beneficial to both countries." This is just a way to deceive the Japanese people. As everyone knows, the only thing the US-Japan Security Consultative Committee has done since its establishment is the exchange of notes between Japan and the United States on the US-Japan "Security Treaty" on September 14. The Japanese people have been strongly demanding the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," but the exchange of notes this time did not change the unequal nature of the treaty itself. The statement in the notes that the "US-Japan Security Treaty" "fully conforms" to the spirit of the United Nations Charter only makes Japan more "legally" tied to the U.S. war chariot.

    The Fujiyama-Dulles talks are publicized as a continuation of the Kishi-Eisenhower talks. In the sense that Japan is subservient to the United States, it is indeed a continuation. From the Kishi-Eisenhower talks to the Fujiyama-Dulles talks, it can be clearly seen that the policy pursued by the current Japanese government is completely incompatible with the Japanese people's desire to strive for independence, autonomy, and peace. This policy will not only fail to lead Japan to the path of independence and autonomy, but will also bring disastrous consequences to the Japanese people.

    评藤山、杜勒斯会谈
    本报评论员
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎借出席联合国大会的机会，到华盛顿同美国国务卿杜勒斯举行了会谈。会谈的内容，据说涉及到日美两国之间外交和经济关系的许多问题。
    在经济方面，日本似乎对于这次会谈抱有不小的期待。日本经济目前正面对着国际收支巨大逆差的困难局面，这种逆差主要来自对美国的贸易；而美国对日货的抵制，自6月岸信介访美以来，非但没有缓和，反而愈演愈烈。9月20日，日本经济团体联合会等三团体举行会议，准备成立一个联合委员会以对付美国的抵制日货运动和增加日本的对美国的输出，但是会议决定在成立联合委员会之前，要先看看藤山同美国谈判的结果。显然，照日本统治阶级的某些人士看来，日本现政府在政治和军事方面既然打出了亲美反共的旗号，更加依附美国，估计可能换取在经济方面同美国讨价还价的某些余地，甚至可能得到美国方面的某些让步。然而，藤山和杜勒斯23日发表的联合声明，对于持有这种想法的人，却兜头泼下了一瓢冷水。
    联合声明中只是简单地提到：“藤山先生提请注意美日贸易的相互重要性，并特别提到日本同美国贸易中的巨大逆差”；而杜勒斯更轻描淡写地“表示了他了解日本对它的对外贸易所感到的忧虑”。显而易见，如果日本光是为了说明日美贸易的重要性以及日本对美贸易的巨大逆差，而美国也只是为了表示它“了解”日本在对外贸易方面所感到的忧虑，又何必要藤山千里迢迢去会晤杜勒斯呢？联合声明中这种空洞的词句，只能说明藤山出国以前所表示的“要坚决地请求”“美国务必制止对日本货限制进口”的打算是落空了。
    关于日本要美国出钱建立开发东南亚的国际基金问题，今年6月间岸信介访问美国的时候就曾提出过，美国当时敷衍说需要加以“研究”，美国对于这个计划之不感兴趣是很明显的。但是这次藤山在同杜勒斯会谈的时候，还是把这个问题提出来了，并且希望日美双方能“就美国政府出资问题取得原则上的谅解”。联合声明中对于这个问题却只字不提，可见结果还是不妙。
    日本把对外贸易叫作它的“生命线”。既然把贸易问题看得如此严重，日本就应该有自己的独立自主的政策。日本对美贸易的巨大逆差，光靠“坚决请求”美国大发慈悲是解决不了的。本来，日本是完全可能找到另外的出路的。作为同亚非国家友好相处的一员，真正同亚非各国在平等互利的基础上进行经济合作，就是改善日本国际收支、发展日本经济的可靠途径之一。然而日本政府不作这样的打算，甘愿顺从美国，甚至为了博得美国的欢心，不惜作出种种不利于亚洲国家加强经济合作的事情。最近日本政府大肆张扬地接待台湾蒋介石集团的什么“特使”张群，显然也是为讨好美国而作出的反共、反中立主义的姿态之一。
    日本政府顺从美国的政策，既然换不到经济方面的利益，在政治谈判方面就更不可能有什么结果。据说，藤山在同杜勒斯会谈中提出了琉球群岛和小笠原群岛的地位问题。联合声明中表示：“日本政府对日美安全委员会的建立，及该委员会在促进有利于两国的合作和谅解方面所表现的效率感到满意”。这不过是蒙蔽日本人民的一种手法。大家知道，日美安全委员会成立以来所作的唯一事情，就是9月14日日美两国就日美“安全条约”所交换的照会。日本人民一直强烈地要求废除日美“安全条约”，而这次交换的照会却并没有改变条约本身的不平等性质，照会中所谓“日美安全条约”“充分符合”联合国宪章精神的说法，不过是使得日本更加“合法”地绑到美国战车上了。
    藤山同杜勒斯的会谈，被宣传为岸信介同艾森豪威尔会谈的继续。在日本顺从美国这个意义上，的确是一个继续。从岸信介同艾森豪威尔的会谈，到藤山和杜勒斯的会谈，使人们可以清楚地看到：日本现政府所奉行的政策同日本人民争取独立自主、争取和平的愿望是完全不相符合的。这种政策不但不能使日本走向独立自主的道路，而且会给日本人民带来灾难性的恶果。
