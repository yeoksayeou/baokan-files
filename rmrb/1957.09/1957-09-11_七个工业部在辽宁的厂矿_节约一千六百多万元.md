　　Shenyang, September 10th (from this newspaper) Since the industrial system of Liaoning Province launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy at the beginning of this year, it has achieved remarkable results. The coal, pig iron, steel, pit props, and cotton yarn saved by the factories and mines under the seven industrial ministries of metallurgy, coal, electricity, the First Ministry of Machinery, light industry, food, and textiles in Liaoning alone are worth more than 16 million yuan.

　　The broad masses of workers and staff in various factories and mines have actively started from promoting advanced experience, improving production technology, adopting substitute materials, and increasing the utilization rate of raw materials to tap production potential and open up ways to increase production and practice economy, while ensuring product quality. In the past six months or so, more than 36,000 people in the ten industrial departments have put forward more than 39,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 12,000 have achieved significant results in production.

　　Due to vigorous efforts to save raw materials, several major raw materials that had been in short supply in Liaoning Province since last year have now stabilized, and many enterprises have shifted from reducing production to increasing production. However, the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign is not balanced enough. Backward enterprises should actively learn from advanced levels.

　　七个工业部在辽宁的厂矿
　　节约一千六百多万元
    本报沈阳10日电　辽宁省工业系统从年初开展增产节约运动以来，已经取得显著成就。仅冶金、煤炭、电力、第一机械、轻工、食品和纺织等七个工业部在辽宁的厂矿，节约的煤炭、生铁、钢材、坑木和棉纱等，就值一千六百多万元。
    各个厂矿的广大职工，在保证产品质量的前提下，积极从推广先进经验、改进生产技术、采用代用材料、提高原材料利用率等方面着手，来挖掘生产潜力，开辟增产节约的门路。半年多来，在十个工业部系统中，有三万六千多人提出了三万九千多件合理化建议，其中已经有一万二千多件在生产中取得显著效果。
    由于大力节约原材料，辽宁省从去年起就显得紧张的几种主要原材料，现在都已趋于稳定，不少企业由减产转向增产。但是，增产节约运动开展得还不够平衡。落后了的企业应积极向先进水平看齐。
