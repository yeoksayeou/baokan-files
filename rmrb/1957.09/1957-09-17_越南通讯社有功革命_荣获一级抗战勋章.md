Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 16th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam awarded the Vietnam News Agency a First-Class Resistance Medal on September 15th in recognition of its outstanding contributions to the revolutionary struggle.

Premier Pham Van Dong attended the grand ceremony held at the Solidarity Club on the evening of the same day to commemorate the agency's twelfth anniversary, and delivered a speech.

The Vietnam News Agency was established almost simultaneously with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Declaration of Independence, read by President Ho Chi Minh in Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi twelve years ago, was the first news item broadcast by the Vietnam News Agency. During the anti-war period, the news agency relocated twenty-one times, and eight comrades sacrificed their lives in the struggle. Some reporters were awarded military merit medals for bravely completing reporting assignments in the midst of gunfire. Over the past twelve years, the number of editors and reporters at the news agency has grown from six to more than one hundred. Currently, it has eight branch offices domestically, and has reporters stationed in China, India, Cambodia, and Paris, and has established ties with news agencies in other Asian countries.

    越南通讯社有功革命
    荣获一级抗战勋章
    据新华社河内16日电　越南民主共和国政府9月15日以一级抗战勋章颁给在革命斗争中功勋卓著的越南通讯社。
    在当天晚上隆重举行的纪念这家通讯社成立十二周年的会上，范文同总理也参加了在团结俱乐部举行的这个纪念会，并且讲了话。
    越南通讯社差不多是同越南民主共和国同时成立的。十二年前胡志明主席在河内巴亭广场宣读的独立宣言，就是越南通讯社播发的第一条新闻。在抗战期间，这个通讯社曾经作过二十一次转移，有八位同志在斗争中献出了生命。有的记者因为在枪林弹雨中英勇完成报道任务而荣获军功勋章。十二年来，这个通讯社的编辑记者已经从六人发展到一百多人。目前它在国内有八个分社；在中国、印度、柬埔寨和巴黎派有记者，并且同亚洲另外一些国家的通讯社建立了联系。
