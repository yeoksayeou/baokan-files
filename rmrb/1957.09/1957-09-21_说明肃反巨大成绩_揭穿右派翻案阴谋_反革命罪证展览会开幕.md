Xinhua News Agency, September 20th. The Exhibition of Evidence of Crimes by Counter-Revolutionary Elements and Other Criminal Offenders, organized by the Ministry of Public Security, opened today at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace.

    The exhibition has four parts. The first three parts exhibit evidence and charts illustrating the great achievements of our country's purge struggle. The first part exhibits evidence from thirty-four cases involving historical counter-revolutionaries, reactionary secret societies, capitalists engaging in counter-revolutionary propaganda, and counter-revolutionary elements hidden within the Catholic Church. An animated chart in this section indicates that from June 1955 to December 1956, a total of 716,503 pieces of counter-revolutionary evidence were seized, including 172,796 reactionary documents, 10,837 rifles and pistols, 525,402 bullets, and 57 radio stations. The exhibits in the second part inform people that in the internal purge campaign launched in July 1955, more than 81,000 counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements have been uncovered, clarifying the political issues of more than 1.3 million people. This part exhibits evidence from forty cases involving dispatched spies, lurking spies, current sabotage, and political swindlers. The third part exhibits evidence from thirty-seven cases of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek dispatched spies uncovered from the second half of 1955 to the first half of this year.

    The exhibition also exhibits evidence of crimes by counter-revolutionary elements who seized the opportunity to attempt restoration during the rampant attacks of bourgeois rightists. Among them are pictures, weapons, and other evidence of crimes in cases such as the attack on the CCP District Committee and District Office by the "Chinese Righteous People's National Salvation Army" counter-revolutionary organization in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, and the murder of the township head by counter-revolutionary element Shen Mengchun in Guantao County, Shandong Province. Viewers paid particular attention to visiting the evidence of the so-called "wrongful convictions" by rightist elements Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu. Among them are pictures and evidence of cases such as the case of Xie Xin, a counter-revolutionary element at Beijing Normal University, and the case of Han Guoping, a counter-revolutionary element in Longguan County, Hebei Province, which Huang Shaohong considered "wrongful convictions." This evidence exposes the conspiracy of Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu to reverse the verdicts of counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements.

    The fourth part exhibits evidence from more than forty cases involving thieves, swindlers, hooligans, and rapists. The animated chart in this section illustrates that after liberation, the People's Government, relying on the broad masses of the people, severely cracked down on the destructive activities of bad elements endangering the interests of the country and the people, criminal cases gradually decreased, and social order became more consolidated. This part of the exhibition hall displays a large number of fabrics, leather goods, rubber shoes, watches, Renminbi, and industrial goods stolen by criminal offenders, which shows that the destructive situation of criminal offenders is still quite serious.

    说明肃反巨大成绩　揭穿右派翻案阴谋
    反革命罪证展览会开幕
    据新华社20日讯　公安部举办的反革命分子和其他刑事犯罪分子罪证展览会今天在北京劳动人民文化宫开幕。
    展览会有四个部分。前三部分展出的罪证和图表，说明我国肃反斗争取得了巨大的成绩。第一部分共展出历史反革命、反动会道门、资本家进行反革命宣传及隐藏在天主教中的反革命分子等方面的三十四个案件的罪证。这一部分的一个电动图表上，标明1955年6月到1956年12月，共缴获反革命罪证七十一万六千五百零三件，其中有反动证件一十七万二千七百九十六件，长短枪一万零八百三十七支，子弹五十二万五千四百零二枚，电台五十七部。第二部分的展览品告诉人们，在1955年7月展开的内部肃反运动中，已经查出了反革命分子和其他坏分子八万一千多名，弄清了一百三十多万人的政治问题。这部分共展出派遣特务、潜伏特务、现行破坏、政治骗子等方面的四十个案件的罪证。第三部分展出的是从1955年下半年到今年上半年破获的三十七个美蒋派遣特务案件的罪证。
    展览会还展出一些在资产阶级右派猖狂进攻时，趁机图谋复辟的反革命分子的罪证。其中有浙江省金华县“中国义民救国军”反革命组织袭击中共区委会和区公所，山东省馆陶县反革命分子申孟春杀害乡长等案件的图片、凶器和其他罪证。观众们特别注意参观被右派分子黄绍竑、谭惕吾认为所谓“冤案”的罪证。其中有被黄绍竑认为“冤案”的北京师范大学反革命分子谢昕、河北省龙关县反革命分子韩国屏等案件的图片和罪证。这些罪证揭穿了黄绍竑、谭惕吾企图为反革命分子和坏分子翻案的阴谋。
    第四部分共展出了盗窃犯、诈骗犯、流氓犯、强奸犯等方面的四十多个案件的罪证。这部分的电动图表上说明在解放以后，人民政府依靠广大人民群众，严厉地打击了坏分子危害国家和人民利益的破坏活动，刑事案件逐渐减少，社会秩序更加巩固。这部分展览室里陈列着被刑事犯罪分子偷窃的大批布匹、皮货、胶鞋、手表、人民币和工业用品等财物，这说明刑事犯罪分子的破坏情况还相当严重。
