Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: An unprecedented new scene has emerged on China's transportation front this year since liberation: railway, sea, river, and highway transportation are all very smooth. The amount of goods transported in the first seven months of this year is much higher than in the same period last year. According to statistics, trains transported more than 18 million tons of materials such as coal, grain, timber, steel, and ore; in terms of sea and river transportation, the main sea and river routes such as the Yangtze River, Heilongjiang River, and coastal areas alone transported 2,384,400 tons more materials; in terms of automobile transportation, the freight volume increased by more than one million tons. In the first seven months of this year, automobiles, trains, and ships also transported a total of 100,380,000 more passengers than in the same period last year.

The reason why the transportation front is so smooth this year is that, in addition to the relatively stable national construction and production plans this year, which created favorable conditions for balanced transportation, the main reason is the cooperation between various transportation departments and between transportation departments and consigning departments. In the first half of this year, sea and river transportation and railways carried out combined water and land transportation. Some ports and stations that can handle whole batch cargo business have piloted combined transportation; highway systems in Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Liaoning provinces have also participated in combined transportation. The transportation in these areas has completely eliminated the phenomenon of vehicles waiting for ships, ships waiting for vehicles, and vehicles and ships waiting for goods. In the past, due to the disconnection of vehicles and ships, goods were sometimes backlogged in docks and warehouses for a long time; after the combined transportation connected vehicles and ships, some materials were directly transferred from ships to vehicles, thus fundamentally changing the situation of goods backlog.

This year, the sea and river transportation department adjusted loading and unloading equipment and manpower and provided timely support to ports with tight transportation. At the end of June this year, Shanghai suffered unprecedented heat in more than 80 years, and it was also continuously raining, making it very difficult for workers to load and unload goods. More than 100,000 tons of materials were backlogged at the port, and there were very few ships. In the past, this situation would definitely affect other transportation systems, leading to a nationwide blockage. However, because the Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, and Heilongjiang port authorities transferred a large number of stevedores and loading and unloading equipment to support Shanghai Port, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee also organized the city's loading and unloading forces to help with loading and unloading, the tense situation in Shanghai Port was quickly changed.

This year, railway, sea and river, and highway transportation departments have all taken the initiative to cooperate with consigning departments. Under the leadership of the party committees of various provinces and cities, the various shipping bureaus of sea and river transportation and the various management bureaus of railways have established joint offices with local transportation and consigning units to study the sources of goods and prepare transportation plans, which not only guaranteed the sources of goods but also improved the accuracy of transportation plans. In the past, sea and river transportation often felt that there was insufficient cargo and that ships and port equipment could not be fully utilized. This year, the joint office allocated materials that were more suitable for water transportation to ships, which not only reduced the burden on railway transportation but also increased the source of goods for sea and river transportation. The local governments of Shandong, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and other twelve provinces also compiled flow charts of goods this year, which greatly reduced the phenomenon of reverse flow and repeated transportation.

### 水陆运输空前畅通  今年前七个月比去年同期多运一亿旅客

    水陆运输空前畅通
    今年前七个月比去年同期多运一亿旅客
    据新华社31日讯  今年我国交通运输战线上出现了解放以来所没有过的新景象：铁路、海河和公路的运输都很畅通。今年前七个月比去年同期多运送的货物数量很大。据统计，火车多运的煤、粮食、木材、钢铁、矿石等物资达一千八百多万吨；海河方面，仅长江、黑龙江和沿海等主要海河运送的物资，就多达二百三十八万四千多吨；汽车运输方面，货运量增加一百多万吨。汽车、火车和船舶今年前七个月还比去年同期共多运送了一亿零三百八十多万旅客。
    今年运输战线上所以畅通无阻，除了今年国家建设和生产计划比较平稳，为均衡运输创造了有利条件以外，主要是各运输部门之间、运输部门同托运部门之间都进行了协作。今年上半年海河和铁路开展了水陆联运，一部分能够办理整批货物业务的港口、车站，都试行了联运；山东、江苏、福建和辽宁等省的公路系统也参加了联运。这些地区的运输，完全消除了车等船、船等车和车船等货的现象。过去由于车船脱节，有时货物长时积压在码头仓库；联运将车船衔接起来以后，有些物资直接从船上转装上车，因而从根本上改变了货物积压的情况。
    海河运输部门今年调整了装卸设备和人力，对运输紧张的港口进行了及时的支援。今年6月底，上海遭受了八十多年来所没有过的奇热，而且霪雨连绵，工人装货卸货很困难，港口积压了十多万吨物资，船舶又很少。这种情况在往年必定会影响到其他运输系统，以致发生全国性堵塞。但是，由于天津、大连、青岛、黑龙江等港务局抽调了大批搬运工人和装卸设备前往支援上海港，上海市委也将市内的装卸力量组织起来帮助装卸，上海港的紧张情况得以迅速改变。
    今年，铁路、海河和公路运输部门，都主动同托运部门进行了协作。海河的各航务局和铁路的各管理局，都在各省市党委领导下，同地方运输、托运单位成立了联合办公室，互相研究货源和编制运输计划，既保证了货源也提高了运输计划的准确性。海河运输方面过去老感到货源不足，船舶和港口设备不能发挥潜力；今年通过联合办公室把由水路运送更合理的物资调拨给船舶运送，既减轻了铁路运输负担，也增加了海河运输货源。山东、河北、黑龙江等十二个省的地方政府今年还编制了货物流向图，使倒流、重复运输的情况大大减少。
