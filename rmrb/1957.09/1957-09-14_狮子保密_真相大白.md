　　The Truth About the "Lion Secret" Comes to Light

　　Rightist Lu Yi once said at a forum held by the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference: "There is very little news in the newspapers because news must be released uniformly, and everything must be kept secret. The arrival of the lion in Shanghai must be kept secret, and the fact that the West Suburb Park found a male elephant for 'Nan Jiaozi' must also be kept secret." These clamors of Lu Yi aroused the common interest of the Wenhui Daily rightists at the time. On May 7th, the newspaper sent a special dispatch from Beijing, linking the lion's secrecy with the Zuo Ye incident.

　　What is the truth of the matter? Xia Yu, director of the Shanghai Municipal Gardening Management Office, revealed Lu Yi's fabrication and slander in a written statement at a recent meeting of the Municipal People's Congress. Xia Yu said: The African lion that was shipped from West Germany last year was transported to the animal breeding farm of the Hongqiao Road Gardening Office for temporary isolation and quarantine after more than a month of ocean voyage. That afternoon, a reporter from the Xinwen Daily requested to take a photo, and the Gardening Office agreed and notified the director of Zhongshan Park to wait to contact the reporter. However, the Xinwen Daily reporter did not arrive at Zhongshan Park until 8 p.m., and it would be even later to rush to Hongqiao Road. The lion was kept in a small wooden box. The lion could only lie down and had no room for activity (and in fact, it was impossible to take pictures). The animal breeding farm also lacked sufficient lighting equipment. Even using a flash would not produce a good photo, and it would also greatly disturb the lion and possibly cause an accident. We told him to come back to take pictures tomorrow after the lion was moved to an iron cage. After much explanation, the reporter left with skepticism. Later, this lion was moved to a cage in Zhongshan Park, and we notified various newspapers to come and take pictures. On July 18th of last year, the Jiefang Daily published a photo of this lion. This is the so-called "truth about the lion's secrecy."

　　Xia Yu pointed out: The problem is very clear. It is not a question of "lack of freedom of the press" after liberation, but entirely Lu Yi's fabrication of facts. (Excerpt from Jiefang Daily)

### “狮子保密”真相大白

　　“狮子保密”真相大白
    右派分子陆诒曾在上海市政协召开的座谈会上说：“报上新闻很少，因为新闻要统一发布，什么都要保密。狮子到上海要保密，西郊公园替‘南娇子’找了头雄象也要保密。”陆诒这些叫嚣，当时引起了文汇报右派分子的共同兴趣。5月7日该报从北京发来专电，把狮子保密和左叶事件连在一起。
    事实真相究竟怎样呢？上海市园林管理处处长夏雨在不久以前举行的市人代会会议的书面发言中，揭穿了陆诒的造谣和污蔑。夏雨说：去年从西德运来的那只非洲狮子，经一个多月的远洋航行，下船后就运往虹桥路园林处的动物繁养场暂时隔离检疫。当日下午，新闻日报记者要求拍照，园林处表示同意，并通知中山公园主任等候与记者接洽。但新闻日报记者延至下午八时才到达中山公园，如果再赶到虹桥路，时间更晚。狮子是关在一个狭小的木箱子里的。狮子只能躺着，无一点活动余地（事实上也无法拍照）。动物繁养场又无充足的灯光设备。即使用镁光灯拍摄也是拍不成的，而且对狮子的惊动又大，可能发生意外危险。我们对他说，等明天将狮子移到铁笼里去后再来拍照。经过多方面解释，记者才将信将疑而去。后来这头狮子改放在中山公园兽笼内，我们曾通知各报前来拍照。去年7月18日解放日报登出了这狮子的照片。这就是所谓“狮子保密的真相”。
    夏雨指出：问题很清楚，不是什么解放后“新闻不自由”的问题，而完全是陆诒捏造事实。  （摘自解放日报）
