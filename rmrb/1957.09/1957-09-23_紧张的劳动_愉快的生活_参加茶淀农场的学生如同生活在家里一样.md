Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd. The two thousand high school and junior high school graduates from Beijing who are participating in production at the Chadian Youth Farm near Tianjin are living a tense and happy working life.

The farm's original more than seven thousand mu of rice is about to ripen, and now the young people are excitedly preparing for the autumn harvest by repairing roads, repairing threshing grounds, and sharpening sickles. On the twenty-one roads leading to the paddy fields, there are happy crowds everywhere, filling in the ditches on the roads, pulling out weeds, and then rolling them flat with stone rollers. Two threshing grounds, each more than two hundred mu in size, have been rushed to completion, and transformers and threshing machines are being installed. The highway connecting the north and south fields will be completed before National Day and will be named "Youth Road."

These young people have launched challenge competitions in their labor. Many have expressed their desire to strive to join the Party and the League through labor. Currently, the Communist Youth League organization at the farm has received more than sixty applications for membership.

Whenever work ends, the entire quiet courtyard suddenly becomes lively. Some people go to the library to read newspapers and magazines, while others go to catch crabs and fish. The basketball and table tennis teams of each production team also use this time to practice, preparing to select the farm's representatives to participate in the sports meet held by the general farm. More than one hundred and thirty people have joined the dance troupe, drama troupe, chorus, and storytelling troupe, and they are rehearsing programs to be performed at the celebration of the harvest and the founding of the farm.

Each production team sends a full-time cadre with production experience to lead the young people in labor and teach them production techniques. The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau has also transferred several middle school teachers to the farm as cadres, mainly to conduct political and ideological education for the students participating in production and to provide guidance in study and life. In order to take care of the special problems of female students, the farm has specially sent non-full-time female cadres to be their life counselors. The young people feel that the care they receive here is just like being at home. (Attached pictures)

### 紧张的劳动  愉快的生活  参加茶淀农场的学生如同生活在家里一样

    紧张的劳动  愉快的生活
    参加茶淀农场的学生如同生活在家里一样
    新华社22日讯　到天津附近茶淀青年农场参加生产的北京两千名高、初中毕业生，过着紧张愉快的劳动生活。
    农场原有的七千多亩水稻快要成熟了，现在青年们正在兴奋地做着修道路、修场院、磨镰刀等秋收前的准备工作。在通往稻田去的二十一条道路上，布满了欢乐的人群，大家把道路上的沟填平，野草拔掉，然后再用石滚轧平。两个二百多亩大的场院已抢修完毕，正在安装变压器、脱粒机。沟通南北两场的公路将在国庆节前赶修完成，它将被命名为“青年路”。
    这些青年人在劳动中展开了挑战竞赛。许多人表示要在劳动中争取入党入团。现在农场里的共青团组织已收到六十多人的入团申请书。
    每当收工回来之后，整个寂静的大院子顿时欢腾起来。有的人到图书室看报、看杂志，有的人去捉螃蟹、摸鱼；各生产队的篮球、乒乓球代表队也利用这个时间练习，准备选拔全场的代表队去参加总场举行的运动会；一百三十多人参加了舞蹈团、话剧团、合唱团、说唱团，他们正排练在庆祝丰收、庆祝建场典礼时演出的节目。
    每一个生产队都派一个有生产经验的脱产干部，带领这些青年人劳动，教给他们生产技术。北京市教育局还抽调了好几个中学教师到农场来作干部，主要是对参加生产的学生进行政治思想教育，作学习和生活上的辅导工作。为了照顾女学生的特殊问题，场里专门派来了不脱产的女干部作她们的生活辅导员。青年们感到在这里得到的照顾，如同在自己家里一样。（附图片）
